[00:00:00.782 --> 00:00:04.684]  This is a Monday evening emergency broadcast.
[00:00:05.304 --> 00:00:11.368]  Please call your friends, your family, everyone you know, and tell them to tune in now and share this link.
[00:00:12.287 --> 00:00:25.995]  The Mark of the Beast is officially being announced as we speak and if humanity submits to this and lets them give us these worldwide medical ID cards, we're going under a communist Chinese social credit score.
[00:00:26.275 --> 00:00:33.479]  I'm about to lay out what's happening across the world and why it's so dangerous and why we must resist now or forever be slaves.
[00:00:34.124 --> 00:00:39.505]  It's Monday, July 19th, 2021, and I'm up here very late at night with Rob Doo putting out this emergency
[00:01:00.891 --> 00:01:15.676]  Alert this this emergency broadcast concerning total planetary social credit score enslavement system, not just being announced, but being deployed, being implemented.
[00:01:16.817 --> 00:01:22.979]  And I went home today at about six o'clock, saw my wife, saw my child, had some dinner.
[00:01:24.161 --> 00:01:25.962]  And then I had to come back and my wife understood.
[00:01:26.022 --> 00:01:27.462]  I said, I gotta call the crew.
[00:01:27.502 --> 00:01:35.585]  I gotta see who'll stay with me to come back up and shoot this special report because something this serious, you can't even wait till tomorrow.
[00:01:36.285 --> 00:01:39.366]  Because who knows if tomorrow will even be there when things like this are happening.
[00:01:40.926 --> 00:01:49.009]  All the developments happening are just over the top in a historical perspective.
[00:01:49.949 --> 00:01:52.510]  If you used a yardstick historically,
[00:01:53.775 --> 00:01:57.258]  Or a barometer as a historical measure.
[00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:05.905]  The type of tyranny we see being rolled out very quickly is the most intense tyranny the world's ever seen.
[00:02:06.666 --> 00:02:08.347]  It is simply staggering.
[00:02:09.328 --> 00:02:17.115]  And now the final pieces of a tyranny, the surveillance, the control, the checkpoints, the lockdown of the economy,
[00:02:18.757 --> 00:02:45.458]  Are coming to fruition and the final pieces of the violence of a tyranny, of a democide, of a genocide are here, not just with these poisoned inoculations masquerading as vaccines, but with the global lockdown still ongoing in India and many areas of Africa and other parts of the world that the UN admits has 280 plus million people extra on the verge of death
[00:02:46.058 --> 00:02:46.498]  We're good to go.
[00:03:10.612 --> 00:03:13.413]  And then the ones that sit back and say, oh, look, the whole world's starving to death.
[00:03:13.794 --> 00:03:14.934]  Give the UN more power.
[00:03:14.994 --> 00:03:16.035]  Give UNICEF more money.
[00:03:16.395 --> 00:03:17.415]  We'll feed the starving.
[00:03:17.836 --> 00:03:34.704]  Then we'll organize them into these UN refugee camps in Latin America, in Africa, in the Middle East, in Asia, and then invade the Western world with these people signed up with the UN to then be clients inside the West to basically have reverse colonization.
[00:03:35.244 --> 00:03:37.486]  So we're going to lay all of this out today.
[00:03:38.486 --> 00:03:39.967]  But first, the reason we're doing
[00:03:40.527 --> 00:03:56.178]  This emergency report that is front and center the global vaccine passport that is the foundation of the worldwide social credit score and what compliance with this incredible evil really means.
[00:03:56.558 --> 00:03:57.399]  Here's how it works.
[00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:04.323]  You download the Travel Pass app on your iPhone, then snap a selfie and scan your passport to verify your identity.
[00:04:04.944 --> 00:04:07.946]  If you're vaccinated, you can upload a copy of your certificate.
[00:04:09.557 --> 00:04:15.720]  If your destination requires a COVID test, you can book in at a participating lab.
[00:04:17.722 --> 00:04:20.283]  The results will automatically upload in the app.
[00:04:20.703 --> 00:04:22.985]  A green check mark means you're clear to travel.
[00:04:23.385 --> 00:04:30.669]  Now before I lay out this information and play the chilling clip from the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson,
[00:04:31.775 --> 00:04:42.417]  And break down what's happening in other areas of the world with this rollout of the World ID, the Social ID, the Medical ID that Klaus Schwab and the UN have been announcing that they want as their main goal for many years that's down here.
[00:04:42.437 --> 00:04:46.058]  I want to just give you a real world example of what we're talking about.
[00:04:47.058 --> 00:04:50.938]  Paul Joseph Watson has done work with Infowars off and on for 19 years.
[00:04:52.799 --> 00:04:53.819]  And he still writes for Infowars.
[00:04:53.859 --> 00:04:54.819]  He has his own site.
[00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:59.560]  I've tried to get Paul to move to the United States last year and a half.
[00:05:00.891 --> 00:05:13.175]  And I explained to him that London is an epicenter of the world to prepare the public for this world ID, for this world empire, for this world social credit score.
[00:05:13.215 --> 00:05:25.399]  And that as soon as they announced their Freedom Day six months ago, that was going to be in a few months, I said, Paul, they're going to move the goalpost of Freedom Day to the end of the summer.
[00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:27.860]  And I said, and then
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.323]  They're going, and I told him this on air, I told him this off air, I told you on air.
[00:05:33.524 --> 00:05:47.514]  I said, they will then announce, oh, Freedom Day is a medical ID on your phone and or a bracelet to be able to go out of your house and buy and sell and have a job or get on a boat or get on a train or get on an airplane.
[00:05:48.475 --> 00:05:51.597]  And Paul said, well, if that's the case, I'm going to leave when that happens.
[00:05:55.299 --> 00:05:57.200]  It's now happened, so I'm going to lay that out in a moment.
[00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:02.083]  Eddie Bravo, top jujitsu guy, one of the top guys in the world, if not the top guy.
[00:06:02.344 --> 00:06:04.545]  Definitely a trailblazer, good friend of mine of many years.
[00:06:04.565 --> 00:06:11.990]  One of the great French benefits of being friends with Joe Rogan for 22 years is I've been friends with Eddie Bravo for 16, 17 years.
[00:06:13.351 --> 00:06:14.252]  Eddie's an incredible guy.
[00:06:15.172 --> 00:06:18.995]  Funny, smart, you name it, and in many ways more awake than I am.
[00:06:19.035 --> 00:06:21.737]  I mean, he's into stuff and research that I haven't even done.
[00:06:23.564 --> 00:06:31.591]  I was just telling him a month ago when he was here for a big fight that he was sponsoring with some of his fighters, and I said, Eddie, you need to leave Los Angeles.
[00:06:31.611 --> 00:06:32.551]  You need to leave California.
[00:06:33.012 --> 00:06:34.613]  I said, they will bring back new lockdowns.
[00:06:34.653 --> 00:06:39.577]  He said, well, they claim they're ending them in a few months, but if they bring them back, I'm going to have to leave.
[00:06:41.539 --> 00:06:42.920]  Well, now they're bringing the lockdowns back.
[00:06:43.721 --> 00:06:47.564]  So this was a plan to never stop these lockdowns.
[00:06:47.584 --> 00:06:51.267]  This has always been the psychology of getting you to
[00:06:52.586 --> 00:07:03.468]  Submit to tyranny, submit to lockdown, submit to mask, submit to being tracked and traced, and then, oh, there's a lot of things in the tunnel, comply, and we'll loosen the noose around your neck.
[00:07:03.988 --> 00:07:05.349]  But they never really fully release it.
[00:07:05.709 --> 00:07:13.970]  They let it off a little bit, so in the future, when they finally draw the noose around your neck, you won't struggle or fight, and then they're never going to release it.
[00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:17.491]  So this is basic Pavlovian psychology, and
[00:07:20.725 --> 00:07:27.131]  I was talking to Eddie today, some in text messages, and he's not sure whether or not he's going to end up having to leave.
[00:07:27.171 --> 00:07:35.500]  He sure hopes he isn't, but he's getting ready for that, and he's got a lot of family and a lot of businesses and a lot of roots in Southern California, and I get it.
[00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:37.442]  But he understands what's happening.
[00:07:37.902 --> 00:07:43.608]  Paul Watson, friend of mine, known the guy 19 years, I guess since 2001, yeah, 20 years.
[00:07:47.372 --> 00:07:59.118]  I said, you watch, it's going to come back, it's going to be permanent, it's going to be an ID on the phone, and I talked to Paul today and he's like, well, I got a year lease on my condo, my apartment, and I'll just have to fight it here.
[00:07:59.899 --> 00:08:12.306]  And maybe he's right, maybe that's the thing to do, but this is diabolical, this is a plan, and only having zero compliance with it is going to stop it.
[00:08:12.646 --> 00:08:14.067]  And a lot of you are probably saying,
[00:08:14.892 --> 00:08:16.273]  Well, so what?
[00:08:16.353 --> 00:08:23.480]  I'll just take the shot and I'll just carry a phone around and I'll just let them scan me to go in the grocery store or the shopping mall or for my car to start.
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:32.088]  I want to explain to you, after we cover these articles, where they're going to take you if you submit to that because this is just the doorway to tyranny.
[00:08:32.288 --> 00:08:34.990]  I want to tell you what's down those stairs and in that dungeon.
[00:08:35.651 --> 00:08:42.016]  So whether you believe in the Bible and the devil and God, corruption and oppressive forces believe in you.
[00:08:42.757 --> 00:08:55.609]  And if they could ever have an ID system to make you submit to them and make you politically be aligned with them to be able to buy and sell, they would have complete control over every facet of your life.
[00:08:56.129 --> 00:09:03.016]  For thousands of years in every culture and every society, governments would try to control the money and control the people and control culture.
[00:09:03.436 --> 00:09:04.277]  Every time they did it,
[00:09:04.793 --> 00:09:10.776]  They would see all sorts of alternate currencies and black markets emerge.
[00:09:11.316 --> 00:09:12.736]  So what were they going to do?
[00:09:13.317 --> 00:09:15.798]  Well, they couldn't do anything because of human nature.
[00:09:16.558 --> 00:09:25.242]  But now with computers, and now with surveillance, and now with control, and now with the tests that have been going on for decades in Communist China, allied with the biggest U.S.
[00:09:25.282 --> 00:09:32.025]  tech companies, they have developed systems of total surveillance and social control over their people.
[00:09:32.845 --> 00:09:42.872]  That is way more sophisticated and evil than what John tried to describe in his vision that became the final book of the Bible, Revelation.
[00:09:44.113 --> 00:09:50.255]  But this social credit rating goes far beyond a traditional credit score, which is based on your finances.
[00:09:50.876 --> 00:09:57.318]  China's version factors in everything from jaywalking, to smoking on trains, to buying too many video games.
[00:09:57.798 --> 00:10:03.681]  If your score gets too low, you can be banned from buying plane tickets, renting a house, or getting a loan.
[00:10:04.321 --> 00:10:11.224]  So now, in late July 2021, we have a corporate governmental authoritarian alliance.
[00:10:12.398 --> 00:10:34.106]  With the Fortune 100, the United Nations, the Communist Chinese, Hollywood, the blue cities, the blue states, the left, all pushing a worldwide ID based on whether or not you've taken experimental injections that the ruling powers at the World Health Organization want you to take.
[00:10:36.027 --> 00:10:37.007]  And so just last week,
[00:10:39.039 --> 00:10:47.669]  We saw Macron, who had promised a year ago and six months ago, no one's going to make you have a medical ID, no one's going to make you have an inoculation to have these apps.
[00:10:48.618 --> 00:10:50.440]  Now they come out and say, yes, we built the apps.
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:53.883]  You must have this app on your phone.
[00:10:53.923 --> 00:10:59.769]  We must authorize you to have this app for you to even go to a grocery store or go to a bar or go to your job.
[00:11:00.109 --> 00:11:04.353]  There were massive demonstrations around the country and riots that were legitimate.
[00:11:04.914 --> 00:11:06.836]  And so he, quote, backed off two days ago.
[00:11:06.876 --> 00:11:13.102]  And I said on my Sunday show, I said, watch, he'll come back in a few days and say, actually, I didn't back off.
[00:11:14.397 --> 00:11:15.518]  Here's your prison sentences.
[00:11:15.678 --> 00:11:16.118]  And he did.
[00:11:16.158 --> 00:11:20.961]  He said six years in prison and massive fines.
[00:11:21.001 --> 00:11:22.122]  I'll show you that article in a moment.
[00:11:22.522 --> 00:11:23.863]  So that's how their psychology works.
[00:11:23.983 --> 00:11:25.884]  Every time we oppose them, they back off.
[00:11:26.244 --> 00:11:34.689]  Once we dissipate, they come back again because they know we're emotional instead of being steadfast and not ever backing down.
[00:11:34.849 --> 00:11:41.013]  So on Freedom Day, Boris Johnson announces mandatory vaccine passports.
[00:11:41.533 --> 00:11:42.774]  So they've been telling people
[00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:44.941]  In the UK for a year.
[00:11:45.802 --> 00:11:46.582]  Six months into that.
[00:11:47.043 --> 00:11:48.264]  It's been going on for a year and a half total.
[00:11:49.024 --> 00:12:02.535]  If you will wear your mask, take your injections, do what we say, let us track you, let us control you, let us quarantine you for two weeks when you come back into the country, and do all this crap that politicians and others are exempt from, by the way, they have a program.
[00:12:03.977 --> 00:12:07.279]  And the politicians, of course, don't follow any of it because they're lords and you're slaves.
[00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:08.500]  We're slaves.
[00:12:09.221 --> 00:12:11.423]  He said, we'll then let you go back to being free.
[00:12:12.756 --> 00:12:18.280]  But now he came out today on Freedom Day from a TV screen instead of a press conference.
[00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:23.363]  The elite separating itself from the press, from the people, behind their walls.
[00:12:23.963 --> 00:12:25.384]  We're locked up on lockdown.
[00:12:25.684 --> 00:12:29.827]  He's God knows where in the world at some palatial giant estate.
[00:12:31.028 --> 00:12:35.291]  That's what big tech, that's what the big bankers, that's what the royalty are doing.
[00:12:35.571 --> 00:12:36.792]  They're at giant estates.
[00:12:37.674 --> 00:12:42.676]  Completely free, doing whatever they want all day long, while you're locked in your little coffin apartment.
[00:12:42.976 --> 00:12:53.240]  And here he is, like Emperor Palpatine in Star Wars, onto a screen, wherever he's at, giving his orders to the slaves.
[00:12:53.901 --> 00:13:04.045]  And saying, on Freedom Day, you will no longer be able to have a PCR test, that you have to pay for, hundreds of dollars, to say you don't have COVID-19.
[00:13:05.305 --> 00:13:06.906]  That has now been dispensed with.
[00:13:07.167 --> 00:13:20.938]  You must now take an experimental shot that never got legal authorization in your body that's already caused massive death or you are not allowed to go to the bars or go out to see live music.
[00:13:21.338 --> 00:13:29.886]  And of course you know and they admit the plan is once you accept that, once it's beta tested, then it's the grocery store, then it's a shopping mall, just like Macron said last week.
[00:13:30.566 --> 00:13:33.188]  And again, why are all these countries following the same directives?
[00:13:33.528 --> 00:13:34.849]  Because it's the United Nations.
[00:13:35.189 --> 00:13:46.277]  What the United Nations says, oh, it didn't come from a lab, oh, hydroxychloroquine isn't good, or ivermectin isn't good, or rendezvous isn't good, whatever they say is now the law.
[00:13:46.758 --> 00:13:54.183]  You wake up and you're under United Nations AI control and censorship enforced by governments and big tech.
[00:13:54.743 --> 00:13:59.547]  We need even more young adults to receive a protection
[00:14:00.094 --> 00:14:04.976]  That is of immense benefit to your family and friends and to yourselves.
[00:14:05.417 --> 00:14:15.782]  And so I would remind everybody that some of life's most important pleasures and opportunities are likely to be increasingly dependent on vaccination.
[00:14:16.362 --> 00:14:24.486]  There are already countries that require you already to be double jabbed as a condition of quarantine free travel.
[00:14:25.126 --> 00:14:28.048]  And I'm afraid that list seems likely to grow.
[00:14:28.929 --> 00:14:35.994]  We're also concerned, as they are in other countries, by the continuing risk posed by nightclubs.
[00:14:36.194 --> 00:14:54.786]  I don't want to have to close nightclubs again, as they have elsewhere, but it does mean nightclubs need to do the socially responsible thing and make use of the NHS Covid pass, which shows proof of vaccination, a recent negative test or natural immunity as a means of entry.
[00:14:56.158 --> 00:15:05.261]  As we said last week, we do reserve the right to mandate certification at any point if it's necessary to reduce transmission.
[00:15:05.301 --> 00:15:21.806]  And I should serve notice now that by the end of September, when all over 18s will have had their chance to be double jabbed, we're planning to make full vaccination the condition of entry to nightclubs and other venues where large crowds gather.
[00:15:22.711 --> 00:15:26.353]  Proof of a negative test will no longer be enough.
[00:15:27.554 --> 00:15:36.258]  We want this country to be able to enjoy the fruits of our massive efforts and of our enormous vaccination campaign.
[00:15:37.439 --> 00:15:46.004]  But to do that, we must remain cautious and we must continue to get vaccinated.
[00:15:46.044 --> 00:15:50.286]  And that's why we're asking you to come forward and get your jabs now.
[00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:59.343]  Now, let me stress, we want people to be able to take back their freedoms as they can today.
[00:16:00.723 --> 00:16:03.484]  I'm here to announce your happy Freedom Day.
[00:16:04.365 --> 00:16:16.289]  I'm here to tell you that you're going to have a government ID on your phone, where you have proven that we've been able to put in your body what we want, an experimental injection, or you can't have a job, you can't live, you're going to be put in prison.
[00:16:16.969 --> 00:16:19.510]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, the Mark of the Beast is here.
[00:16:20.373 --> 00:16:22.295]  These globalists love to rub it in on us.
[00:16:23.156 --> 00:16:31.546]  What did they say in Israel a few months ago when everybody had to wear bracelets that they'd been injected or tracking satellite bracelets that they were on quarantine?
[00:16:31.766 --> 00:16:33.728]  They called them freedom bracelets.
[00:16:34.636 --> 00:16:50.319]  That's like the sign above Auschwitz that says, work will make you free, or what we saw in the fictional idea of a Soviet future in 1984, that war is peace, freedom is slavery, ignorance is intelligence, or whatever the exact lines were.
[00:16:50.939 --> 00:16:59.621]  Here we are seeing the gaslighting in our face when they admit the vaccine isn't protecting you from future COVID variants.
[00:16:59.881 --> 00:17:04.062]  They could never have a cure for that.
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:26.645]  But you see, there's always going to be a new cold virus, and so now you're all suspect forever with AI tracking you, with fake PCR tests that are 94% false, dominating your life, making every man, woman and child in the world a suspect criminal, a dirty, horrible thing on the face of the planet, a virus that must be eradicated.
[00:17:26.846 --> 00:17:28.606]  Because the virus is only a metaphor.
[00:17:29.006 --> 00:17:35.829]  With the globalists of humans that are the virus that they say is a virus that must be removed from the earth to save the planet.
[00:17:36.249 --> 00:17:37.990]  They have scripted themselves.
[00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:45.433]  They have cast themselves as the saviors and only after we've been removed can this new utopia begin.
[00:17:46.033 --> 00:17:48.794]  They tell you compliance will get you out of lockdown.
[00:17:49.434 --> 00:17:52.415]  They tell us that compliance will get us out of the mask.
[00:17:52.995 --> 00:17:56.597]  But the more we comply, the worse it gets.
[00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:14.322]  The more we submit, the more demands they issue because we're being held captive by a scientific dictatorship that isn't using the old methods of jet airplanes and fighter bombers and troops and machine guns and tanks.
[00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:19.175]  This is all psychological war and an invisible enemy.
[00:18:19.475 --> 00:18:34.373]  And the supposed helpers, the medical system, through the corporate world and through the UN, is literally coming at us with so-called vaccines that are experimental, that aren't vaccines, that have not been linked but have been conclusively proven.
[00:18:36.288 --> 00:18:36.368]  Yes.
[00:18:52.389 --> 00:19:01.274]  And then there's the corporate media and there's big tech dutifully suppressing all these deaths and medical doctors and nurses and scientists that speak up.
[00:19:01.714 --> 00:19:03.636]  This is all a beta test.
[00:19:04.376 --> 00:19:15.883]  COVID as bad as it's been and the millions starving to death and the lockdowns and the suicides and all the folks that have died from lack of medical treatment while the hospitals sat empty but you still paid your insurance.
[00:19:17.216 --> 00:19:34.792]  That was all a beta test for what's coming if we accept the social credit score, if we accept the vaccine passports, if we let France and the once great UK and all these other areas bully us into adopting the system they're under.
[00:19:35.152 --> 00:19:42.479]  So you look at France, you look at the UK, you look at Australia, and you say screw them, let them labor under the British Crown, let them labor under the New World Order.
[00:19:42.739 --> 00:19:53.405]  But that world government system that came out of Cecil Rhodes 120 years ago, that set up the CFR, set up the New World Order, and the system they're under is already coming here.
[00:19:53.725 --> 00:19:57.667]  So it's England and France under this nightmare, Mark of the Beast today.
[00:19:58.027 --> 00:19:59.428]  It's us within two years.
[00:20:00.108 --> 00:20:02.809]  There is no future now if we don't stop this.
[00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:09.113]  I've studied the Club of Rome, the Bilderberg Group, the Davos Group, the Rockefeller Foundation.
[00:20:09.793 --> 00:20:11.114]  I've studied Bill and Melinda Gates.
[00:20:11.254 --> 00:20:12.314]  I've studied IBM.
[00:20:12.754 --> 00:20:14.655]  I've studied what their goal is and their plan.
[00:20:16.036 --> 00:20:25.440]  They believe that humans will continue to consume until we've hit 20 million people and the whole world collapses in starvation and war.
[00:20:26.261 --> 00:20:32.544]  And so they believe they've got to orchestrate a controlled collapse before that big collapse comes.
[00:20:35.148 --> 00:20:39.391]  They even sold members of my family on that before I was even born.
[00:20:40.372 --> 00:20:50.058]  But I woke up to their master plan, myself and my own research, and I later even convinced members of my family that what they'd been taught was wrong, like my father.
[00:20:50.879 --> 00:21:03.528]  Now, he didn't join them, but he was recruited by them, and he went to UT when he was in high school, part of Plan 2, and after that, and he didn't tell me any of this until 14 years ago when he saw my film, Endgame,
[00:21:04.517 --> 00:21:05.718]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:21:08.921 --> 00:21:09.862]  Before it even came out.
[00:21:10.582 --> 00:21:11.143]  And he saw it.
[00:21:11.183 --> 00:21:15.247]  My mother looked at him in my studio, on a couch, watching it on a big screen TV.
[00:21:17.388 --> 00:21:18.189]  At our old offices.
[00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:19.671]  We moved here 14 years ago.
[00:21:21.352 --> 00:21:22.753]  And she said, David, this can't be true.
[00:21:22.793 --> 00:21:23.774]  And he said, no, it's all true.
[00:21:23.874 --> 00:21:26.817]  I, you know, I went to plan two, you know, I was part of that, you know.
[00:21:28.007 --> 00:21:29.448]  You know, about people who were involved in it.
[00:21:29.468 --> 00:21:32.390]  She goes, yeah, I remember having dinner with the head of the botany department.
[00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:34.212]  I remember some of those people you're talking about.
[00:21:34.792 --> 00:21:38.595]  And he's like, yeah, no, those are the people that tried to recruit me for this world government plan.
[00:21:39.736 --> 00:21:44.400]  And he said, yeah, they would take us when we were in high school and give us a Petri dish.
[00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:48.983]  They do this all over the country with top, top test score kids.
[00:21:49.924 --> 00:21:54.948]  There was six kids out of Texas in the group that were in this group with my dad by the time they were sophomores in high school.
[00:21:56.633 --> 00:22:18.344]  They took Petri dishes that had, I guess, cuters, what they call it, what bacteria grow on, and they would put some bacteria on it and seal it and put it under a lamp where it had heat and show how, over a certain amount of time, the bacteria would eat all of the medium and then eat each other and then the whole thing would be dead, a black, dead mess, within a few weeks.
[00:22:20.245 --> 00:22:24.667]  And they would show them that and they would say, this is what happens if we don't
[00:22:25.672 --> 00:22:27.453]  Set up a world government, depopulate people.
[00:22:28.014 --> 00:22:40.982]  It's a very simple equation, very simple test, but at the same time the experiment certainly got people on board very, very quickly.
[00:22:41.656 --> 00:22:43.878]  And so my dad was not that special.
[00:22:44.318 --> 00:22:50.523]  This was happening to thousands of young people a year across the world who are being inducted into this system.
[00:22:51.203 --> 00:22:54.986]  I separately reverse engineered it and exposed it and fought it myself.
[00:22:55.066 --> 00:22:58.189]  But the point is, we're talking about the real world.
[00:22:58.529 --> 00:23:00.390]  We're talking about what governs the planet.
[00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:02.632]  We're talking about what's going to happen to you and your family.
[00:23:03.072 --> 00:23:08.917]  And so the idea to have the New York Times poo-poo eugenics and poo-poo globalism and the New World Order
[00:23:09.497 --> 00:23:20.183]  While this is the governing system of our planet, is them simply not wanting the general public to be participants in a larger debate about what's actually happening.
[00:23:20.663 --> 00:23:26.606]  And so the system is now establishing a global social credit score tied to your phone.
[00:23:28.106 --> 00:23:47.176]  And then if you're not a good globalist, if you don't submit to the shots they want at the beginning, or the political controls they want, or you don't agree to be publicly sterilized, or you don't agree to send your children for gender reassignment, I mean notice out of the gates they want you to take experimental shots right up front that are all over the news as killing people.
[00:23:49.457 --> 00:23:49.998]  Think about that.
[00:23:50.798 --> 00:23:53.860]  And so imagine up front it's something that horrible,
[00:23:55.180 --> 00:24:00.086]  Imagine what's coming next, because I'll tell you the genius, Klaus Schwab, and whoever's programming him.
[00:24:01.668 --> 00:24:03.570]  They don't talk about utopias anymore.
[00:24:03.850 --> 00:24:05.753]  They don't say world government's going to save the earth.
[00:24:06.013 --> 00:24:08.136]  They don't say it's going to be beautiful puppy dogs and kittens.
[00:24:08.476 --> 00:24:14.083]  He goes, you're going to own nothing, you're going to have nothing, and you're going to like it, and we're going to get rid of humans because humans are bad.
[00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:25.998]  They're not even mincing words because Klaus Schwab wants to scare the intelligentsia and scare all the leftists that signed on to depopulate to save the earth.
[00:24:26.299 --> 00:24:28.561]  They're now realizing they're going to get depopulated too.
[00:24:29.621 --> 00:24:30.782]  So you see, that's the key to this.
[00:24:32.644 --> 00:24:36.046]  Once you sign on to this thing, you have signed on to literal hell.
[00:24:36.527 --> 00:24:38.909]  Once you've devalued your fellow humans,
[00:24:40.785 --> 00:24:45.146]  And said, I've got to get rid of them to save the Earth, but really, because I want their resources, I want to play God.
[00:24:45.966 --> 00:24:56.068]  You've gotten rid of the checks and balances and the chivalry that would have protected you, and you've opened the gates to a literal scientific hell.
[00:24:57.328 --> 00:24:58.949]  So here we are in the middle of 2021.
[00:24:59.029 --> 00:25:00.909]  The future's here.
[00:25:02.049 --> 00:25:06.410]  And world government's being established, and its end game is forced depopulation.
[00:25:07.432 --> 00:25:07.612]  I don't
[00:25:31.206 --> 00:25:34.007]  I got a tumor in the shock point, a tumor under my arm and all my lymph nodes.
[00:25:34.407 --> 00:25:36.967]  I mean, the doctors are like, I've never seen cancer like this.
[00:25:36.987 --> 00:25:37.487]  Get in there now.
[00:25:38.348 --> 00:25:42.209]  And that's the good news is, the doctors are freaking out.
[00:25:42.469 --> 00:25:44.769]  Because they were trained in the tail end of real science.
[00:25:45.329 --> 00:25:47.830]  And they were trained to understand what's going on.
[00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:49.270]  So they see the death happening.
[00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:52.771]  So I open the phones up, just loaded with medical doctors.
[00:25:54.241 --> 00:25:57.582]  And by the way, we call them back and make them send us their ID cards.
[00:25:57.982 --> 00:25:58.823]  And it's real doctors.
[00:25:59.163 --> 00:26:02.684]  Surgeons, cancer doctors, you name it.
[00:26:02.984 --> 00:26:04.024]  We've had a bunch of them on the show.
[00:26:05.085 --> 00:26:07.105]  And they're getting so pissed, they're going to speak out.
[00:26:07.225 --> 00:26:12.907]  So, ladies and gentlemen, this is earth-wrecking, human-wrecking stuff.
[00:26:14.788 --> 00:26:16.329]  I mean, just today I showed like 20 articles.
[00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:23.695]  Where they go, it's pretty normal to grow tumors once you take the Pfizer or Moderna shot, don't worry.
[00:26:24.336 --> 00:26:28.820]  But again, you go to your doctor and they go, holy hell, this is malignant!
[00:26:31.563 --> 00:26:32.764]  And these people are dying!
[00:26:38.143 --> 00:26:40.343]  It looks like what they're giving people is super cancer.
[00:26:41.084 --> 00:26:44.184]  I mean, some of these people are dying of cancer within one month of getting these shots.
[00:26:44.524 --> 00:26:50.165]  You get the shot and every isolated dormant cancer in your body just turns on and you get eaten.
[00:26:51.785 --> 00:26:54.706]  And again, I'm facing the end of my life right now.
[00:26:54.846 --> 00:26:58.887]  I mean, I look at my children, I look at my wife, I look at my friends, I care about everybody.
[00:26:59.327 --> 00:27:01.647]  I mean, folks, this is real.
[00:27:01.687 --> 00:27:02.967]  This isn't me up here just saying this.
[00:27:04.068 --> 00:27:05.408]  I wish to God this wasn't true.
[00:27:06.394 --> 00:27:08.234]  But see, they know how Stockholm Syndrome works.
[00:27:08.814 --> 00:27:15.636]  They know that when you're hit with something this bad, the average person will make excuses and say it's not real because they don't want to face what's happened.
[00:27:15.916 --> 00:27:21.037]  Because there's no real leadership pointing out what's happened and saying no to it, and that's why they've done this.
[00:27:21.257 --> 00:27:23.137]  Because the national media is going to black out.
[00:27:23.257 --> 00:27:28.258]  Anybody saying they died of cancer, anybody died of stroke, anybody died of heart attack, it's so sick.
[00:27:28.598 --> 00:27:34.979]  But that leads us to this next huge, absolutely huge piece of news.
[00:27:37.102 --> 00:27:47.348]  That's why we do this emergency broadcast tonight, not just their announcement of the Mark of the Beast, the global social credit score, and you won't be able to have a job or go to the store unless you have this system on your phone.
[00:27:47.408 --> 00:27:48.549]  I mean, this is so criminal.
[00:27:49.366 --> 00:27:53.507]  To then totally control you once you're under that and make you do more, more, more, more, more.
[00:27:53.687 --> 00:28:00.569]  I mean, my God, I've taken a very dangerous gene therapy injection that makes your body attack itself is the beginning thing you want.
[00:28:01.210 --> 00:28:01.930]  See, they're smart.
[00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:03.650]  They're not even getting you in slow now.
[00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:11.813]  They're making you bow down to hardcore stuff and submit and basically adapt to them saying, give us your children to sacrifice them.
[00:28:13.226 --> 00:28:23.939]  The Babylonians, the Aztecs, the Mayans, the Druids, every culture at one point or another demanded firstborn children to sacrifice.
[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:28.164]  And now they're about to authorize zero to twelve.
[00:28:30.148 --> 00:28:31.469]  COVID doesn't even affect children.
[00:28:31.489 --> 00:28:34.050]  They admit it, but they say it'll screw and they're going to do it.
[00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:35.570]  And that's kind of them.
[00:28:35.891 --> 00:28:46.455]  The system's kind of holding off to see if we're going to allow this because they want to metaphysically involve us and killing our own children because they convinced us babies aren't humans before they're born, which they are.
[00:28:46.815 --> 00:28:51.938]  That kind of raised the level of control that kind of lowered God's heads of protection.
[00:28:53.458 --> 00:28:54.879]  But if they can convince us,
[00:28:57.017 --> 00:29:05.029]  To let them inject children and then just like with autism, cover up how they're hurt, how they're maimed, how they kill, then they can get away with anything.
[00:29:06.151 --> 00:29:08.174]  So let's hit the second big reason we're doing this.
[00:29:09.536 --> 00:29:11.239]  Monday emergency transmission.
[00:29:12.389 --> 00:29:14.130]  Big article on InfoWars.com.
[00:29:14.851 --> 00:29:16.672]  I saw a video yesterday about this.
[00:29:17.173 --> 00:29:33.905]  We played it today, and I confirmed that there was a big conference in California, and that they had a bunch of lawyers there, and that they did file this lawsuit, and that they have found not just the VAERS reporting system, but 10 other reporting systems.
[00:29:34.565 --> 00:29:37.948]  And the full video is linked in this article on InfoWars.com.
[00:29:39.215 --> 00:29:43.939]  And I'm sure it's going to be taken down, just like the lawyers say, so we'll try to save it and put it at banned on video.
[00:29:43.959 --> 00:29:46.821]  But let me read you some of this right now.
[00:29:47.202 --> 00:29:54.908]  Huge whistleblower says at least 45,000 people died from experimental COVID jab just in the first rollout of it.
[00:29:55.469 --> 00:30:02.675]  And that's only those who died in the first three days of receiving the injection, which all I have is open phones, people saying everybody was dying.
[00:30:04.079 --> 00:30:06.721]  Remember, this is out of 330 million, so that sounds like a lot.
[00:30:06.761 --> 00:30:07.782]  It's not, but it's still bad.
[00:30:08.362 --> 00:30:09.783]  New lawsuit filed against U.S.
[00:30:09.803 --> 00:30:13.405]  Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra.
[00:30:13.746 --> 00:30:14.966]  And then it goes on from there.
[00:30:15.207 --> 00:30:20.971]  Testimony to add proof of 45,000 Americans have died within three days of receiving the COVID-19 shot.
[00:30:21.271 --> 00:30:26.814]  The declaration comes as part of a new lawsuit filed Monday by American frontline doctors against U.S.
[00:30:26.835 --> 00:30:28.295]  Department of Health and Human Services.
[00:30:29.392 --> 00:30:33.557]  We're back here with Dr. Brian Harris.
[00:30:33.597 --> 00:30:39.504]  We did an interview with him and he wasn't able to release the numbers at 3 o'clock.
[00:30:39.564 --> 00:30:41.987]  So 3 o'clock today right here in Anaheim.
[00:30:42.007 --> 00:30:42.728]  What happened Brian?
[00:30:48.374 --> 00:30:59.987]  As confirmed today by Thomas Renz that just filed federal papers in a lawsuit against the government, 45,000 confirmed dead from the COVID-19 shots within three days so far, and they've covered it up.
[00:31:02.245 --> 00:31:08.686]  45,000.
[00:31:02.505 --> 00:31:08.686]  The VAR's data has only reported 11,000, but there's 11 different report systems into the government.
[00:31:09.487 --> 00:31:12.287]  One of them alone has 45,000 that they have not released or told you.
[00:31:12.567 --> 00:31:18.509]  And Thomas Rins has got the paperwork, has the whistleblower, has the sworn affidavit, and they've actually already filed a lawsuit today.
[00:31:18.689 --> 00:31:19.269]  It's not a game.
[00:31:19.289 --> 00:31:19.569]  Stay tuned.
[00:31:19.589 --> 00:31:20.589]  It's disgusting.
[00:31:20.949 --> 00:31:28.851]  And now they want to push on every child, and they've passed a law that by September of this year, by the fall, they will be able to vaccinate every 5-year-old in America before they go to school.
[00:31:29.751 --> 00:31:31.633]  45,000 confirmed dead from one reporting system.
[00:31:31.914 --> 00:31:34.456]  Breaking news right here on the MG Show from Anaheim, California.
[00:31:34.476 --> 00:31:35.277]  Thank you, Dr. Ardis.
[00:31:35.297 --> 00:31:36.518]  Thanks for tuning in, Matrix Group.
[00:31:36.558 --> 00:31:36.899]  Boom.
[00:31:37.199 --> 00:31:38.941]  Google, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter.
[00:31:39.361 --> 00:31:41.323]  Let me tell you what I'm going to say.
[00:31:42.705 --> 00:31:48.651]  You are complicit in causing death, and I cannot wait to sue you over and over again.
[00:31:50.103 --> 00:32:06.048]  Regarding the sworn declaration under threat of perjury by the omnibus whistleblower, Reina said, I know, and they signed an affidavit, based on the woman's testimony because she's since inside the system, there have been 45,000 deaths based on how many people died within three days of the vaccine.
[00:32:06.408 --> 00:32:11.429]  Keep in mind this is data compiled by just one government system created to track vaccine adverse reactions.
[00:32:11.709 --> 00:32:12.809]  Yeah, the health departments know.
[00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:14.390]  And it goes on from there.
[00:32:15.816 --> 00:32:17.758]  Ladies and gentlemen, they've made their big move.
[00:32:18.219 --> 00:32:19.981]  They're not doing stuff incrementally anymore.
[00:32:20.381 --> 00:32:22.744]  They decided to attack with full force now.
[00:32:23.605 --> 00:32:32.115]  And because Bill Gates woke everybody up with how evil he was in all his past depopulation talk, they removed him a few months ago and I said watch.
[00:32:34.178 --> 00:32:37.680]  We have an archive, let's hope they can find this, but Lister saw me say it at least 500 times.
[00:32:38.301 --> 00:32:41.623]  The Rockefeller Foundation, with the Carnegie, runs it all.
[00:32:42.223 --> 00:32:43.384]  And I said, they run the medical.
[00:32:43.724 --> 00:32:54.590]  I said, they will step in to full command because they control the Bill and Melinda Gates Trust, the IBM Trust, and a bunch of other trusts that are worth trillions.
[00:32:55.011 --> 00:33:00.034]  And their main mission, sworn mission, is to carry out eugenics in the population.
[00:33:00.754 --> 00:33:03.837]  This is a big issue of misinformation, specifically on the pandemic.
[00:33:03.857 --> 00:33:09.441]  In terms of actions, Alex, that we have taken, or we're working to take, I should say, from the federal government,
[00:33:21.551 --> 00:33:25.875]  We've increased disinformation research and tracking within the Surgeon General's office.
[00:33:26.196 --> 00:33:30.640]  We're flagging problematic posts for Facebook that spread disinformation.
[00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:42.051]  We're working with doctors and medical professionals to connect two connected medical experts who are popular with their audiences with accurate information and boost trusted content.
[00:33:42.311 --> 00:33:44.453]  So we're helping get trusted content out there.
[00:33:44.773 --> 00:33:46.475]  A couple of the steps that we have
[00:33:47.095 --> 00:33:48.156]  We're good to go.
[00:34:00.948 --> 00:34:02.250]  And the audience it's reaching.
[00:34:02.970 --> 00:34:03.871]  Also with the public.
[00:34:04.052 --> 00:34:04.752]  With all of you.
[00:34:05.653 --> 00:34:11.039]  To create robust enforcement strategies that bridge their properties and provide transparency about rules.
[00:34:11.079 --> 00:34:18.387]  You shouldn't be banned from one platform and not others for providing misinformation out there.
[00:34:19.738 --> 00:34:27.263]  We have to come to grips with the fact that we're up against a scientific evil that gets drunk off the death of innocent people.
[00:34:27.823 --> 00:34:33.766]  We have to repent for the fact that we've allowed abortion and that we devalued our most young and defenseless humans.
[00:34:34.967 --> 00:34:42.492]  And we have to know that God has forgiven us, but only so that we can take political and cultural and spiritual action against these people.
[00:34:43.453 --> 00:34:53.643]  So if you will humble yourself, as King David said, and repent to God and ask God to lead God and direct you and ask God to take you over, because God doesn't possess people.
[00:34:53.683 --> 00:34:56.225]  You've got to ask via free will for God to direct you.
[00:34:56.686 --> 00:34:57.266]  It will happen.
[00:34:57.286 --> 00:35:01.510]  And then I have no doubt that we will not defeat this evil.
[00:35:02.251 --> 00:35:05.113]  But we first have to admit where we are.
[00:35:06.052 --> 00:35:09.433]  We have to realize the medical system's been taken over and it's compromised.
[00:35:09.933 --> 00:35:12.094]  We have to realize that the federal government's been hijacked.
[00:35:12.654 --> 00:35:23.378]  We have to realize that this evil is prosecuting a depopulation agenda against us because the globalists had lost with Bolsonaro and Trump and all these patriots getting elected.
[00:35:23.818 --> 00:35:25.818]  And people were waking up and rejecting their system.
[00:35:26.139 --> 00:35:29.960]  So they've directed a war against us because we want to be independent.
[00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:30.820]  We want to be human.
[00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:33.061]  We want to be strong to poison us.
[00:35:33.701 --> 00:35:36.782]  And dumb us down and bring us under their control.
[00:35:37.823 --> 00:35:51.449]  So we have to realize their declaration of war against us, which I'm about to cover, is not something we cower to, but something we understand is the fact that they're an outside enemy and so that's why they've declared us an enemy.
[00:35:52.169 --> 00:35:56.691]  And that submitting to them and going along with them is only going to make things worse.
[00:35:57.752 --> 00:36:02.974]  And that you're going to come to that realization sooner rather than later if we have any chance of beating this.
[00:36:04.361 --> 00:36:07.183]  Submission to tyranny is enslavement.
[00:36:07.884 --> 00:36:09.845]  Resistance to tyranny is victory.
[00:36:11.066 --> 00:36:14.669]  We have to realize that America has been captured at the top.
[00:36:15.389 --> 00:36:27.338]  We have to tell our friends and family, we have to reject it, and we have to stand firm realizing that the globalists cannot have an America existing in the type of corporate worldwide tyranny they're setting up.
[00:36:27.839 --> 00:36:28.740]  Here are some of the stories.
[00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:31.782]  Now they're saying Republican Party.
[00:36:33.228 --> 00:36:36.812]  Is the number one national security threat to the United States of America.
[00:36:37.132 --> 00:36:37.653]  Here's another one.
[00:36:37.693 --> 00:36:38.234]  Bombshell.
[00:36:39.295 --> 00:36:43.400]  Pentagon using Obama and Soros linked UK contractor.
[00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:46.731]  I'm going to tell you this, Jason.
[00:36:46.751 --> 00:36:49.493]  I've spent my whole career not as a political operative.
[00:36:49.513 --> 00:36:53.956]  I've never worked on a campaign in my life other than campaigning against Trump.
[00:37:10.567 --> 00:37:11.728]  I'm a national security guy.
[00:37:11.748 --> 00:37:15.371]  I've worked in national security against ISIS and Al Qaeda and Russia.
[00:37:15.692 --> 00:37:22.357]  And the number one national security threat I've ever seen in my life to this country's democracy is the party that I'm in, the Republican Party.
[00:37:22.497 --> 00:37:25.440]  It is the number one national security threat to the United States of America.
[00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:28.583]  And I'll tell you this, if my party retakes the U.S.
[00:37:28.623 --> 00:37:32.106]  House of Representatives in the next cycle, it's going to become a haunted house.
[00:37:32.546 --> 00:37:35.889]  And the ghoul in the specter haunting that house is going to be Donald Trump.
[00:37:36.089 --> 00:37:37.050]  And if Kevin McCarthy's
[00:37:37.552 --> 00:37:42.716]  It is a normal reaction to being dominated, to being enslaved, to being lied to, to get angry, and to stand up and say no to it.
[00:38:01.485 --> 00:38:05.470]  So for those of you that have supported us, I thank you and I appreciate you.
[00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:14.801]  But for those of you out there who I really care about, who don't get why I have so much energy, who don't get why I'm so upset, you're asleep.
[00:38:15.742 --> 00:38:19.026]  You've been put into a globalist, satanic trance.
[00:38:19.667 --> 00:38:22.508]  Where you don't understand that you're under attack.
[00:38:23.188 --> 00:38:25.069]  It is the animating contest of liberty.
[00:38:25.469 --> 00:38:27.209]  It's realizing that freedom isn't free.
[00:38:27.609 --> 00:38:30.830]  And it's engaging those tyrants that makes us who we are.
[00:38:31.591 --> 00:38:33.671]  So this is a great time to be alive.
[00:38:34.271 --> 00:38:35.632]  It's an incredible time to be alive.
[00:38:36.212 --> 00:38:42.414]  This is a time to save your fellow humans and challenge yourself and stand up against really corrupt evil individuals.
[00:38:42.994 --> 00:38:45.415]  Really corrupt evil powers or principalities.
[00:38:46.383 --> 00:38:54.372]  And I'm only encouraging you to realize how important you are right now and to not sit idly by and be a spectator during all of this.
[00:38:56.554 --> 00:38:57.055]  That said...
[00:38:58.370 --> 00:39:02.955]  The world ID is here, the world government is here, there's no longer any doubt about where this is going.
[00:39:03.676 --> 00:39:19.473]  And anybody that submits and takes the digital tattoo, or takes the implantable chip that Klaus Schwab and the Davos group is pushing, anybody that thinks you're going to just take the shot and then they're going to let you go out and be free, notice they're saying, oh that shot didn't work, we got more shots for you.
[00:39:21.035 --> 00:39:23.577]  Because this is a group that's decided to be evil.
[00:39:24.057 --> 00:39:26.119]  This is a group that's decided to try to play God.
[00:39:26.579 --> 00:39:35.546]  This is a group that wants to use the whole population of the world as guinea pigs for their scientific testing so they can try to gain immortality through life extension.
[00:39:37.888 --> 00:39:38.728]  And so that's why I'm here.
[00:39:39.889 --> 00:39:46.114]  I'm here tonight to tell you that I appreciate you and I thank you and I want you to realize how powerful you are and I want you to realize that
[00:39:47.495 --> 00:39:54.352]  If you don't take action now, and if you don't speak out now, and if you don't fight now, you forfeit your chance!
[00:39:55.745 --> 00:39:56.686]  To be part of history.
[00:39:56.926 --> 00:39:59.968]  You forfeit your chance in front of God to say no to these people.
[00:40:00.248 --> 00:40:04.991]  You forfeit your chance to actually be a free, sentient being with conscious energy.
[00:40:05.291 --> 00:40:06.872]  Because if you don't do this, you are an animal.
[00:40:07.252 --> 00:40:08.033]  You're lower than an animal.
[00:40:08.233 --> 00:40:09.354]  An animal will fight for its life.
[00:40:09.974 --> 00:40:13.536]  If you delude yourself because we have incredible power to imagine.
[00:40:13.957 --> 00:40:16.618]  We can imagine jet airplanes and cures to cancer.
[00:40:16.778 --> 00:40:18.860]  We can imagine going to the moon and we've done it.
[00:40:19.633 --> 00:40:25.897]  But you have also the power to delude yourself and to give yourself a virtual reality that none of this is bad and this isn't destructive.
[00:40:26.577 --> 00:40:28.198]  I've already told you what was coming.
[00:40:28.498 --> 00:40:31.780]  It's happened just like I told you because the enemy's battle plans are there.
[00:40:32.041 --> 00:40:32.901]  They think you're an animal.
[00:40:33.061 --> 00:40:33.822]  They think you're dumb.
[00:40:34.182 --> 00:40:35.062]  I don't think you are.
[00:40:36.063 --> 00:40:37.384]  I think you have a right to be aware of this.
[00:40:37.844 --> 00:40:39.145]  And in final closing,
[00:40:40.896 --> 00:40:49.565]  They're already giving pregnant women all over the world the injections and 70 to 80% plus are having violent miscarriages when they take it.
[00:40:51.387 --> 00:40:53.209]  In New England medical journal studies, you name it.
[00:40:54.270 --> 00:40:56.652]  And they're now coming after children that have been born.
[00:40:57.193 --> 00:41:01.857]  And if we don't fight this and if we don't stand up against this, the blood is on our hands.
[00:41:02.557 --> 00:41:03.998]  So that's it for this special report.
[00:41:04.098 --> 00:41:05.239]  Thanks for keeping us on the air.
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:11.744]  Please take this emergency report and share it via email and text message while you still can.
[00:41:11.784 --> 00:41:16.848]  And to all you magnifying InfoWars, you are the tip of the spear and I love you and I appreciate you.
[00:41:17.109 --> 00:41:19.951]  And I thank Rob News for staying up here late tonight to get this report out.
[00:41:20.695 --> 00:41:21.416]  So I've laid it all out.
[00:41:21.436 --> 00:41:22.397]  I've done the best I can.
[00:41:22.417 --> 00:41:25.860]  I hope you take action with this information and we'll have big news tomorrow.
[00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:33.846]  We've got this doctor that's running this lawsuit that we just talked about reporting the 45,000 dead in the first three days from the COVID shots.
[00:41:34.247 --> 00:41:36.208]  We're going to ferret that out and cover that as well.
[00:41:36.528 --> 00:41:37.689]  Weekdays 11 a.m.
[00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:42.173]  Central at freeworldnews.tv and infowars.com.
[00:41:42.373 --> 00:41:42.914]  Thank you so much.
[00:41:53.561 --> 00:41:59.663]  But if people go to MyPillow.com, you have amazing sheets, towels, not just pillows.
[00:42:00.603 --> 00:42:02.364]  You've got your amazing towel pack.
[00:42:02.484 --> 00:42:07.386]  It's, what, $109 for $39.95 with promo code ALEX.
[00:42:07.766 --> 00:42:08.926]  You're barely bringing any money there.
[00:42:08.966 --> 00:42:11.507]  People should purchase it there to fund what you're doing.
[00:42:11.547 --> 00:42:12.047]  They should help.
[00:42:12.387 --> 00:42:13.868]  Buy it at $109 for $39.95.
[00:42:15.609 --> 00:42:19.130]  That's a huge discount by you, and I'm told all other products

[00:42:23.307 --> 00:42:26.647]  So promo code A-L-E-X at MyPillow.com.
[00:42:27.108 --> 00:42:32.269]  And I'm just super excited to tell my listeners to go support you and get great products.
[00:42:32.309 --> 00:42:40.130]  Because if they don't fund this war effort, if they don't back us up and pray for us and spread the word and support us financially, the globalists are going to win.
[00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:42.211]  So again, people got to put
[00:42:42.851 --> 00:42:43.972]  Fuel in your tank.
[00:42:43.992 --> 00:42:46.594]  You are taking the Globalist on toe-to-toe.
[00:42:46.934 --> 00:42:49.416]  And if we don't energize you, well, then we deserve to lose.
[00:42:49.716 --> 00:42:52.178]  So tell folks about these amazing towels.
[00:42:52.238 --> 00:42:55.620]  I don't even want to do this today, but two weeks ago, you sent this to me.
[00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:58.122]  Tell us about the towels, the sheets, all the products.
[00:42:59.298 --> 00:43:01.599]  Well, the towels are the best towels in history.
[00:43:01.639 --> 00:43:02.679]  They actually dry you.
[00:43:02.719 --> 00:43:05.620]  They don't feel like the ones that are all lotion-y.
[00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:06.160]  They work.
[00:43:06.561 --> 00:43:08.321]  These are the towels you've seen on TV.
[00:43:08.361 --> 00:43:09.401]  The best towels ever.
[00:43:09.962 --> 00:43:11.262]  Made with our Southern U.S.
[00:43:11.322 --> 00:43:12.042]  cotton, too.
[00:43:12.683 --> 00:43:13.843]  And they're normally $199.99.
[00:43:16.984 --> 00:43:19.145]  I am doing this for this show coming on.
[00:43:19.205 --> 00:43:25.209]  So it's only this one's only going to be like a 24 hour special for $39.99 with promo code Alex.
[00:43:25.749 --> 00:43:29.431]  And then all the other products, our sheets are on sale right now.
[00:43:30.152 --> 00:43:33.714]  The mygeza sheets, but you have 110 products.
[00:43:33.774 --> 00:43:35.155]  That's one thing we've been able to
[00:43:35.615 --> 00:43:36.216]  We're good to go.
[00:44:05.755 --> 00:44:08.957]  I mean, this is like it's a wonderful life.
[00:44:08.977 --> 00:44:10.638]  I mean, literally a Jimmy Stewart story.
[00:44:10.698 --> 00:44:12.699]  You are standing up.
[00:44:12.919 --> 00:44:16.161]  I'm in the same boat as you at a lower level.
[00:44:25.506 --> 00:44:25.866]  Right.
[00:44:25.886 --> 00:44:26.046]  Right.
[00:44:26.166 --> 00:44:26.287]  Right.
[00:44:26.367 --> 00:44:26.547]  Right.
