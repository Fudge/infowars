[00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:06.172]  A whistleblower inside the Department of Energy contacted someone that works here and said, why is Jones not covering this?
[00:00:06.332 --> 00:00:07.133]  No one else is.
[00:00:07.593 --> 00:00:09.854]  And I read it 20 minutes before I went on air.
[00:00:09.894 --> 00:00:11.075]  And I already knew all of it was real.
[00:00:11.095 --> 00:00:11.655]  We went and checked.
[00:00:11.695 --> 00:00:13.036]  It's on the Department of Energy website.
[00:00:13.376 --> 00:00:22.041]  And it was like being punched in the chest and the stomach over and over again to read, for sure they raped us, for sure they're doing it!
[00:00:23.582 --> 00:00:25.443]  I am so freaking pissed, man!
[00:00:25.823 --> 00:00:27.624]  I can't take much more of these people!
[00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.925]  And the way it's written, it's all slimy!
[00:00:36.405 --> 00:00:40.591]  But I say so much stuff, people just hear it and just think, oh, that's another thing Alex just said.
[00:00:40.851 --> 00:00:41.532]  No, it's not.
[00:00:41.793 --> 00:00:47.580]  It's the biggest frickin' smoking gun I ever saw, to quote Robert Duvall in Network.
[00:00:49.562 --> 00:00:51.663]  It's a big kidded hit, okay?
[00:00:52.143 --> 00:00:56.405]  I mean, this thing would hurt them so frickin' bad!
[00:00:56.425 --> 00:00:58.206]  I hate the New World Order!
[00:00:58.246 --> 00:00:59.526]  I can't stand Bill Gates!
[00:00:59.787 --> 00:01:01.167]  I can't stand Warren Buffett!
[00:01:01.387 --> 00:01:02.748]  I can't stand Ted Turner!
[00:01:03.008 --> 00:01:04.729]  I can't stand Barack Obama!
[00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:06.610]  I CAN'T STAND THEM ANYMORE!
[00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.091]  I WANT THEM OFF MY BACK NOW, YOU MOTHERS!
[00:01:10.611 --> 00:01:15.734]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:19.428 --> 00:01:22.389]  You know, I learned something during the Trump administration.
[00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:24.169]  I had never tried to be in L.A.
[00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.010]  or be in New York or be in D.C.
[00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.631]  to be around the power.
[00:01:31.172 --> 00:01:35.253]  I had never tried to go be a sycophant and in the system.
[00:01:36.013 --> 00:01:39.074]  But I noticed very early on they would work around the clock
[00:01:40.428 --> 00:02:01.500]  To try to make sure that I didn't have access to the president or access to anybody high-level government because I always just thought inform the public about things and then that would percolate up into government and into governance and then we would be able to stand up against tyranny and take action against the globalists.
[00:02:03.761 --> 00:02:05.622]  But it's a balance.
[00:02:06.362 --> 00:02:07.123]  It's a balance.
[00:02:09.622 --> 00:02:13.323]  You also need to target, obviously, people that are in the power structure.
[00:02:14.404 --> 00:02:20.026]  And I'm almost tempted right now, with the news I have that I've been working on the last hour, to just not do the show today.
[00:02:20.526 --> 00:02:27.389]  It probably would be better if I just call Tucker Carlson, call Steven Crowder, call Roger Stone, and try to get on the phone with Trump.
[00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:29.050]  Because I can get on the phone with him if I need to.
[00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.952]  Because I'm not putting the audience down.
[00:02:32.332 --> 00:02:36.195]  We cover so much hardcore stuff here, but we're here every day.
[00:02:36.255 --> 00:02:37.776]  No one kind of takes it serious.
[00:02:38.337 --> 00:02:43.320]  We just drop bomb, after bomb, after bomb, after bomb, after bomb, after bomb, after bomb, after bomb.
[00:02:44.141 --> 00:02:46.102]  But familiarity breeds contempt.
[00:02:46.603 --> 00:02:47.123]  And I get it.
[00:02:47.263 --> 00:02:48.504]  I have contempt for myself too.
[00:02:48.824 --> 00:02:50.866]  I don't realize how important we are and the great work we've done.
[00:02:51.186 --> 00:02:51.847]  I understand that.
[00:02:52.827 --> 00:02:53.408]  I understand that.
[00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:57.211]  Distance makes the heart grow fond.
[00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:59.911]  Familiarity breeds contempt.
[00:03:00.452 --> 00:03:00.972]  A contempt.
[00:03:01.353 --> 00:03:02.734]  So I'm going to go to rebroadcast for a while.
[00:03:02.754 --> 00:03:04.496]  We're going to get real re-ready to shoot the show.
[00:03:04.576 --> 00:03:05.477]  Go live here today.
[00:03:06.298 --> 00:03:08.420]  And then I may not do the show today.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.722]  Just because this is too important.
[00:03:10.942 --> 00:03:17.849]  I have the smoking gun, absolute, total, complete, master plan of the enemy.
[00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.453]  We have them by the short hairs completely and no one is going to care.
[00:03:24.133 --> 00:03:25.014]  It's always the same.
[00:03:25.354 --> 00:03:30.397]  If it's total proof of just absolute evil that will destroy the enemy, no one cares.
[00:03:30.677 --> 00:03:38.182]  If it's some vague cue thing or somebody saw the Virgin Mary in a piece of toast or something, then it's the most important thing in the world.
[00:03:41.357 --> 00:03:44.000]  But I'm here to tell you we had to get back in the new studio today.
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.161]  We weren't quite ready to launch.
[00:03:45.201 --> 00:03:45.721]  It's okay.
[00:03:45.741 --> 00:03:46.482]  Not blaming the crew.
[00:03:46.842 --> 00:03:47.163]  That's okay.
[00:03:47.183 --> 00:03:52.288]  It's going to give me some time while they get set up and ready to go and to prepare my broadcast.
[00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.670]  Because here's the deal.
[00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.875]  I'm not just going to sit here and put this information out and just have it nothing happen.
[00:03:58.915 --> 00:03:59.956]  I'll quit today.
[00:04:00.596 --> 00:04:02.899]  I want to walk away from this place so bad!
[00:04:06.516 --> 00:04:11.079]  Because we have all the evidence of what the enemy's done, and no one does shit with it.
[00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:12.080]  Nothing.
[00:04:13.962 --> 00:04:17.484]  I don't know why people don't have an instinct to victory, but it's incredible.
[00:04:18.265 --> 00:04:19.086]  What am I talking about?
[00:04:19.426 --> 00:04:20.186]  What's the big news?
[00:04:20.527 --> 00:04:21.127]  No one cares.
[00:04:21.167 --> 00:04:22.208]  I shouldn't even say it, probably.
[00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.673]  At least when I call other people that are influential, they care and will look into it and put it out.
[00:04:30.441 --> 00:04:31.522]  I called Paul Watson with this.
[00:04:31.622 --> 00:04:33.083]  Oh, he's busy out on a date or something.
[00:04:33.263 --> 00:04:35.245]  I'm not mad at Paul, he already wrote like five articles today.
[00:04:35.565 --> 00:04:40.009]  It's just that I don't have the people, I don't have the infrastructure, I don't have anything.
[00:04:40.149 --> 00:04:43.392]  I mean, we could have the keys to put Lucifer into the pit of hell!
[00:04:43.612 --> 00:04:44.433]  No one would care!
[00:04:44.913 --> 00:04:46.695]  They'd be busy getting their frickin' nails done!
[00:04:46.715 --> 00:04:50.338]  Oh my God.
[00:04:56.796 --> 00:05:02.957]  You understand, ladies and gentlemen, we have the smoking gun of what did the power outage.
[00:05:03.457 --> 00:05:07.638]  100% it was the Department of Energy and their order to keep the power off.
[00:05:07.898 --> 00:05:08.939]  You understand we have that?
[00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:11.079]  And no one gives a damn!
[00:05:11.519 --> 00:05:12.699]  I quit then!
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.540]  Screw this whole frickin' place, man!
[00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.320]  I mean, this is just all out of control!
[00:05:18.561 --> 00:05:19.441]  It's unbelievable!
[00:05:21.445 --> 00:05:23.967]  We have released so many smoking guns, so much proof.
[00:05:24.207 --> 00:05:31.413]  Joe Biden is on TV, on CNN, saying Xi Jinping is doing a good job invading Hong Kong and running giant death camps.
[00:05:32.393 --> 00:05:32.734]  Fine!
[00:05:32.794 --> 00:05:34.775]  If America wants that, then frickin' have it!
[00:05:34.955 --> 00:05:38.518]  If you want your power turned off by the Department of Energy, then enjoy it!
[00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:41.040]  I'm gonna run some tapes.
[00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.421]  I'm not even sure I'm coming on today.
[00:05:42.441 --> 00:05:43.382]  Screw this whole place.
[00:05:44.203 --> 00:05:45.864]  God, this country's totally effed, man.
[00:05:46.854 --> 00:05:48.575]  God Almighty, let it all burn then!
[00:05:48.595 --> 00:05:53.659]  I mean, we can't even admit aborting babies is murder, so we don't deserve to have power!
[00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.402]  Alright, the United States is being taught to be a third world country.
[00:05:58.042 --> 00:06:00.884]  We're being taught to have no borders and a collapsing power grid.
[00:06:00.924 --> 00:06:02.325]  It's all by design, it's all public.
[00:06:03.126 --> 00:06:06.949]  And I told you in the last few years, I told you in the last week,
[00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:11.192]  That I've got a lot of sources in the power grid, a lot of people working at power plants.
[00:06:11.252 --> 00:06:16.958]  It's all well known that the federal government orders them not to turn up capacity and they've got to get the government to authorize it.
[00:06:17.458 --> 00:06:32.493]  And I told you this on Monday, I told you this on Sunday, I told you this on Tuesday, on Wednesday, on Thursday, and I just got hit before the show like a ton of bricks as we launched the Alex Jones Show here on this Friday, February 19th global transmission.
[00:06:34.434 --> 00:06:40.278]  And it just hit me when I was given a Department of Energy document that's public that no one's gonna care.
[00:06:41.379 --> 00:06:42.080]  No one cares.
[00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:46.803]  I mean, it doesn't matter that it says you're not allowed to produce energy and you've got to keep your power cut off.
[00:06:46.964 --> 00:06:54.389]  It doesn't matter you said you can buy energy from outside the state so they can Enron scam us and charge us up to 10,000 times the amount.
[00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:57.852]  This is smoking gun stuff.
[00:06:58.052 --> 00:07:03.056]  And then I've got a bunch of other big, giant, smoking guns.
[00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:07.101]  But I'm too angry to do the show right now.
[00:07:08.241 --> 00:07:10.462]  I am too damn angry to do this broadcast right now.
[00:07:11.843 --> 00:07:17.886]  And there's a lot of other stuff going on, so I'm gonna just... And I've got to go find my stack of news from yesterday.
[00:07:17.906 --> 00:07:19.247]  I've got to do a lot of stuff around here.
[00:07:20.027 --> 00:07:21.708]  I watched somebody walk out with my stack here.
[00:07:21.788 --> 00:07:23.169]  Everybody's like, oh no, you've got the stack.
[00:07:23.229 --> 00:07:24.009]  Well, I'll go get it myself.
[00:07:25.219 --> 00:07:27.001]  But I'm not even bitching anymore.
[00:07:27.082 --> 00:07:28.824]  I just can't do this six, seven days a week.
[00:07:28.884 --> 00:07:33.590]  And just with the public like zombies everywhere, just like walking into globalist machine gun fire.
[00:07:33.851 --> 00:07:37.956]  And then that weird reanimated corpse Biden stumbling around up there, just all of it.
[00:07:38.236 --> 00:07:39.438]  It's just, it's a joke.
[00:07:40.239 --> 00:07:43.901]  Because people are unconscious from watching TV and playing on their phones all day.
[00:07:44.281 --> 00:07:50.843]  It manipulates all the dopamine receptors, where people think that's the real world, and the real world, they're all, ooh, ooh, ooh, like this.
[00:07:51.103 --> 00:07:52.964]  And I just, I just don't want to be around this anymore.
[00:07:53.184 --> 00:07:54.145]  Maybe Bill Gates is right.
[00:07:54.205 --> 00:07:55.445]  Just kill everybody.
[00:07:55.885 --> 00:07:58.567]  But use neutron bombs at least, and kill them quick, man.
[00:07:58.827 --> 00:08:00.747]  Don't mutate them and torture them and dumb them down.
[00:08:00.907 --> 00:08:01.848]  But Bill Gates likes that.
[00:08:02.108 --> 00:08:06.570]  Bill Gates, get a deal with the globalists, and start neutron bombing the public.
[00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:11.281]  Just neutron bomb everybody, then we don't kill the Earth that the humans have gotten rid of!
[00:08:11.521 --> 00:08:12.221]  Maybe he's right!
[00:08:13.521 --> 00:08:16.262]  Maybe I should go work for Gates and just come up with a neutron bomb plan.
[00:08:16.702 --> 00:08:19.742]  I know Bertrand Russell had one before they called it a neutron bomb.
[00:08:20.783 --> 00:08:22.463]  Maybe that's the answer.
[00:08:24.723 --> 00:08:25.444]  Gotta start over.
[00:08:26.184 --> 00:08:28.224]  You know, God did it, so I guess we're just imitating God.
[00:08:28.244 --> 00:08:31.525]  Maybe I should just salute Bill Gates right now on air.
[00:08:32.265 --> 00:08:33.365]  Pledge allegiance to him.
[00:08:33.805 --> 00:08:34.545]  Nobody else cares.
[00:08:34.565 --> 00:08:36.926]  At least he actually wants to run something.
[00:08:41.761 --> 00:08:44.803]  Alright, I have the giant news, but no one cares of course.
[00:08:44.903 --> 00:08:46.723]  I'm serious, I'm not throwing a fit here, just no one cares.
[00:08:46.984 --> 00:08:54.787]  Maybe if I freak out, maybe if I cut a few fingers off with loppers, people will go, and this is really important, this will bring down the globalists, here let me cut my pinky off, oh now you pay attention?
[00:08:55.828 --> 00:09:02.191]  The Department of Energy on record told Texas, you can't produce more power, I have the damn document with a direct link to them.
[00:09:02.611 --> 00:09:04.412]  They'll just have Snopes say it isn't real!
[00:09:04.932 --> 00:09:06.913]  Hell, we won't even be able to pull it up in there probably!
[00:09:12.509 --> 00:09:14.971]  So, anyways, I'm gonna go to rebroadcast for a while.
[00:09:14.991 --> 00:09:15.871]  I'm gonna try to settle down.
[00:09:15.891 --> 00:09:19.794]  And then, I'm gonna come back and lay all this out for you.
[00:09:22.296 --> 00:09:23.096]  It's so incredible.
[00:09:24.938 --> 00:09:27.299]  And then there's all this other big bombshell news we've got today.
[00:09:27.319 --> 00:09:31.822]  Let's just go to this report.
[00:09:31.842 --> 00:09:35.305]  We don't have time to air the whole thing, but this is a good report.
[00:09:35.325 --> 00:09:38.227]  This is Tucker Carlson.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:46.023]  Months ago, warning about the COVID vaccine, mRNA, and saying it's unproven and untested, and the media all freaking out now.
[00:09:46.463 --> 00:09:48.504]  Just yesterday was saying, take him off the air.
[00:09:48.544 --> 00:09:49.765]  He questioned the vaccine.
[00:09:49.785 --> 00:09:50.445]  You can't do that.
[00:09:50.685 --> 00:09:51.786]  It's not even a vaccine.
[00:09:52.166 --> 00:09:59.829]  And then now you got the internal Zuckerberg report that just came out, where he admits he wouldn't take it because it's untested, and India did ban it.
[00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:05.752]  And then they had Snopes come out and others say, I'm a liar, but I have all the proof and all the documents, and I'm going to show you that.
[00:10:05.772 --> 00:10:09.074]  And Paul Watson wrote a big article up on InfoWars.com about it.
[00:10:10.819 --> 00:10:13.605]  So here is the Tucker Carlson report.
[00:10:13.625 --> 00:10:15.990]  It's actually four and a half minutes.
[00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:16.732]  We'll have time to play it.
[00:10:16.772 --> 00:10:18.014]  Then I'm going to try to settle down.
[00:10:18.034 --> 00:10:19.598]  I'm going to try to come back in here.
[00:10:19.718 --> 00:10:20.239]  It's just that...
[00:10:21.417 --> 00:10:30.444]  I was even mad at myself, too, because I already knew there was a Department of Energy directive not to turn the power up, but instead I just told you that instead of going and getting the document.
[00:10:30.544 --> 00:10:33.427]  One of our producers, Scott, God bless him, did go get the document.
[00:10:33.647 --> 00:10:34.728]  But see, I'm even mad at myself.
[00:10:35.088 --> 00:10:41.974]  It's like, oh, I just tell you there's an agreement and an order and a law, which I knew, but the public doesn't listen to that!
[00:10:42.194 --> 00:10:43.275]  You have to see the document!
[00:10:46.052 --> 00:10:46.993]  Well, you will see it!
[00:10:47.073 --> 00:10:49.354]  You will read it and know why I'm so pissed off!
[00:10:50.114 --> 00:10:51.595]  I'm under attack and so are you!
[00:10:51.615 --> 00:10:53.536]  And I don't want to put up with it anymore!
[00:10:53.716 --> 00:10:55.417]  And I won't put up with these people!
[00:10:56.137 --> 00:10:57.438]  Bunch of damn criminals!
[00:10:58.039 --> 00:10:59.519]  Here's Tucker Carlson on the vaccine.
[00:10:59.539 --> 00:10:59.980]  We'll be back.
[00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:06.843]  After months of hearing that life could never return to normal until we get a vaccine, we got a vaccine.
[00:11:06.883 --> 00:11:07.944]  Two vaccines, actually.
[00:11:08.544 --> 00:11:10.065]  But life did not return to normal.
[00:11:10.605 --> 00:11:11.326]  Life got worse.
[00:11:11.966 --> 00:11:16.613]  We were instructed to take the new vaccine as soon as possible and then to put on more masks.
[00:11:17.234 --> 00:11:18.596]  One mask was no longer enough.
[00:11:19.017 --> 00:11:20.839]  Anyone who complained about that was punished.
[00:11:21.673 --> 00:11:22.994]  Most people obeyed the orders.
[00:11:23.034 --> 00:11:23.975]  They had no choice.
[00:11:24.635 --> 00:11:26.676]  But the whole thing made them nervous.
[00:11:26.997 --> 00:11:27.717]  How could it not?
[00:11:28.378 --> 00:11:30.939]  Why exactly did the rules change all of a sudden, they wondered?
[00:11:31.239 --> 00:11:32.480]  Was there a good reason for that?
[00:11:33.261 --> 00:11:35.382]  When are we finally going to repeal Corona law?
[00:11:35.762 --> 00:11:37.464]  And what about this vaccine?
[00:11:38.084 --> 00:11:42.687]  Why are Americans being discouraged from asking simple, straightforward questions about it?
[00:11:43.247 --> 00:11:45.289]  Questions like, how effective are these drugs?
[00:11:45.709 --> 00:11:46.329]  Are they safe?
[00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:49.392]  What's the miscarriage risk for pregnant women, for example?
[00:11:49.452 --> 00:11:50.452]  Is there a study on that?
[00:11:50.632 --> 00:11:51.213]  May we see it?
[00:11:51.973 --> 00:11:54.594]  And by the way, how much are the drug companies making off this stuff?
[00:11:54.614 --> 00:11:58.175]  Well, there's nothing QAnon about questions like that.
[00:11:58.195 --> 00:12:00.036]  They're not conspiracy theories.
[00:12:00.616 --> 00:12:02.317]  They're the most basic questions.
[00:12:02.917 --> 00:12:06.919]  In a democracy, every citizen has a right to know the answer.
[00:12:07.839 --> 00:12:10.260]  But instead, we got fluff and propaganda.
[00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:14.722]  The media rollout for the vaccine came off like a Diet Pepsi commercial at the Super Bowl.
[00:12:15.142 --> 00:12:17.803]  Tons of celebrity endorsements, not a lot of science.
[00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:23.645]  It was totally disingenuous, and naturally, it had the opposite of the intended effect.
[00:12:24.166 --> 00:12:26.449]  Most Americans already supported vaccines.
[00:12:26.749 --> 00:12:29.812]  They didn't need to be browbeaten in order to be convinced.
[00:12:30.173 --> 00:12:33.496]  They were grateful their kids no longer get tetanus and polio and chickenpox.
[00:12:33.757 --> 00:12:35.138]  They weren't anti-vaxxers.
[00:12:36.246 --> 00:12:42.231]  And yet from the very first day, the way the authorities handled the COVID vaccine did not inspire confidence.
[00:12:42.951 --> 00:12:47.254]  If the vaccine was so great, why were all these people lying about it?
[00:12:47.535 --> 00:12:48.195]  Honest question.
[00:12:48.796 --> 00:12:49.656]  And they were lying.
[00:12:49.716 --> 00:12:50.637]  Clearly they were lying.
[00:12:50.697 --> 00:12:51.858]  You know that for certain.
[00:12:52.338 --> 00:12:58.923]  Because from the moment the COVID vaccine arrived, the most powerful people in America worked to make certain that no one could criticize it.
[00:12:59.644 --> 00:13:02.186]  Here's Bill Gates' wife on CNN back in December.
[00:13:03.618 --> 00:13:16.245]  Do the social media companies, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, on and on, have a responsibility to do more right now, Melinda, in terms of getting this misinformation, this disinformation off their platforms?
[00:13:17.045 --> 00:13:19.366]  They absolutely have a responsibility.
[00:13:19.546 --> 00:13:30.592]  The internet and the rise of social media has happened so quickly that really the regulations and the good policymaking hasn't stayed out in front of it.
[00:13:30.612 --> 00:13:32.433]  And quite frankly, it needs to catch up.
[00:13:33.815 --> 00:13:38.276]  Oh, quite frankly, she says, we need to censor people's views on the COVID vaccine.
[00:13:39.056 --> 00:13:42.037]  Now remember, Melinda Gates is not a scientist.
[00:13:42.237 --> 00:13:44.037]  She did not develop this vaccine.
[00:13:44.137 --> 00:13:48.498]  She has no background in epidemiology or any relevant discipline.
[00:13:48.878 --> 00:13:51.519]  She worked in the marketing department at Microsoft.
[00:13:52.039 --> 00:13:53.459]  But she's the wife of a billionaire.
[00:13:53.599 --> 00:13:54.820]  That's why she's on television.
[00:13:55.020 --> 00:14:00.421]  It's why she's allowed to control what you're allowed to say about the drug she is demanding you inject in your body.
[00:14:01.221 --> 00:14:02.161]  Is this really science?
[00:14:02.801 --> 00:14:03.401]  Not even close.
[00:14:03.622 --> 00:14:04.342]  It's oligarchy.
[00:14:04.782 --> 00:14:06.722]  And all the billionaires are participating in it.
[00:14:07.382 --> 00:14:14.004]  The tech companies announced earlier they would not allow anyone to criticize this vaccine, and anyone who did would be kicked off their platforms right away.
[00:14:14.544 --> 00:14:17.925]  And then corporate media took it upon themselves to enforce this rule.
[00:14:18.365 --> 00:14:28.967]  Just yesterday, CNN ran a story with this headline, quote, Facebook vowed to crack down on COVID-19 vaccine misinformation, but misleading posts remain easy to find.
[00:14:29.907 --> 00:14:30.908]  That's not a news story.
[00:14:31.228 --> 00:14:33.209]  That's an open call for censorship.
[00:14:33.709 --> 00:14:34.169]  And it worked.
[00:14:34.949 --> 00:14:39.852]  CNN identified a group on Facebook called COVID-19 Vaccine Injury Stories.
[00:14:39.892 --> 00:14:41.672]  And the group was exactly what it sounds like.
[00:14:41.713 --> 00:14:44.054]  People talking about their experiences with the vaccine.
[00:14:44.694 --> 00:14:48.115]  Last week, that group was in the top 20 groups on all of Facebook.
[00:14:48.576 --> 00:14:51.397]  Today, after the CNN piece came out, we searched for that group.
[00:14:51.757 --> 00:14:52.477]  We couldn't find it.
[00:14:53.058 --> 00:14:55.199]  Even when we searched specifically for its name.
[00:14:55.899 --> 00:15:00.162]  Effectively, COVID-19 vaccine injury stories no longer exist.
[00:15:00.582 --> 00:15:02.544]  CNN shut them down, erased them.
[00:15:03.544 --> 00:15:14.172]  Instead, search for the word vaccine on Facebook and you will find a lot of material, exclusively material, that matches precisely the storyline approved by Melinda Gates and her fellow non-scientist billionaires.
[00:15:15.014 --> 00:15:15.755]  And the line is clear.
[00:15:15.775 --> 00:15:16.896]  You've heard it a million times.
[00:15:17.136 --> 00:15:18.697]  The COVID vaccine is morally good.
[00:15:19.177 --> 00:15:19.558]  Period.
[00:15:19.878 --> 00:15:20.919]  Don't dare say anything else.
[00:15:21.699 --> 00:15:24.442]  So if your neighbor drops dead after getting the shot, keep it to yourself.
[00:15:24.982 --> 00:15:26.783]  Facts like that are not allowed on Facebook.
[00:15:27.144 --> 00:15:35.190]  I expect to see articles saying Alex Jones wants Bill Gates to kill the world's population with neutron bombs.
[00:15:36.471 --> 00:15:38.333]  It's called devil's advocate.
[00:15:38.453 --> 00:15:39.474]  I don't want that.
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:45.961]  But if you sit there and you say you don't want people to starve to death and have mass cannibalism, no one cares.
[00:15:46.781 --> 00:15:58.464]  But if you say, as society collapses under Agenda 2030, and the UN says billions are planned to starve to death in the next decade, you're gonna have a lot of cannibalism and break down a society in the third world, I gotta think about eating my neighbors!
[00:15:58.884 --> 00:16:01.784]  I gotta think about hauling them up with a chain and chopping them up to eat them!
[00:16:03.685 --> 00:16:10.086]  And I said before I said that, this is a Jonathan Swift allegory of a modest proposal.
[00:16:11.172 --> 00:16:22.981]  Where they were treating Irish so bad, and he was part Irish and English, and he was an aristocrat, and he wrote a big essay, a modest proposal, saying these Irish need to stop bitching about their kids starving to death.
[00:16:24.162 --> 00:16:28.405]  They'd also put them in poor houses, basically slave camps, to work off their debts after the potato famine.
[00:16:28.745 --> 00:16:35.110]  He said, why don't they start plumping up their children and then we'll sell them to English lords and ladies to be roasted and eaten.
[00:16:36.954 --> 00:16:45.014]  Of course, they got satire back at the time and it really woke a lot of people up and they realized how callous they were letting the Irish starve to death.
[00:16:47.435 --> 00:16:51.157]  The left, of course, took it and said, oh my God, Jones wants to really eat his neighbors.
[00:16:51.197 --> 00:16:52.357]  And by the way, I knew they'd do that.
[00:16:52.377 --> 00:16:53.058]  I did it on purpose.
[00:16:53.458 --> 00:16:54.038]  I didn't lie.
[00:16:54.058 --> 00:16:56.419]  I said it was satire in the same segment.
[00:16:56.860 --> 00:17:01.722]  I knew they would take that, put it out and get 50 million views, send us a giant audience to find the real show.
[00:17:02.402 --> 00:17:05.444]  But what you saw last two segments was not me manipulating the left.
[00:17:05.484 --> 00:17:07.005]  That was me having a real meltdown.
[00:17:08.265 --> 00:17:09.326]  And I apologize to the crew.
[00:17:09.366 --> 00:17:09.766]  They're great.
[00:17:09.786 --> 00:17:11.047]  This is the best crew I've ever had.
[00:17:11.367 --> 00:17:15.689]  They've sat up here, went through hell to be here to run the show with the power off and all the rest of the insanity.
[00:17:17.301 --> 00:17:26.883]  But I'll just tell you, before I went live on air, I got a bunch of extra news that I already was told by a very close person to me.
[00:17:28.524 --> 00:17:36.406]  And I dropped the ball on Monday and just said, I've been told by inside sources in Texas power plants
[00:17:37.406 --> 00:17:39.467]  That the feds ordered them not to increase power.
[00:17:39.867 --> 00:17:41.128]  I should have followed up on that.
[00:17:41.308 --> 00:17:42.589]  I already knew there was those agreements.
[00:17:42.609 --> 00:17:43.850]  I already knew about those documents.
[00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:45.271]  I should have gotten the current ones.
[00:17:45.531 --> 00:17:46.331]  I should have found out.
[00:17:46.571 --> 00:17:47.772]  Well, let me see the directive.
[00:17:47.852 --> 00:17:52.595]  Instead, I just went and poured another glass of wine and sat by the fire in the dark.
[00:17:54.949 --> 00:18:02.753]  And then, son of a bitch, a whistleblower inside the Department of Energy contacted someone that works here and said, why is Jones not covering this?
[00:18:02.773 --> 00:18:03.754]  No one else is.
[00:18:04.194 --> 00:18:07.676]  And I read it 20 minutes before I went on air, and I already knew all that was real.
[00:18:07.696 --> 00:18:08.256]  We went and checked.
[00:18:08.316 --> 00:18:09.657]  It's on the Department of Energy website.
[00:18:09.997 --> 00:18:18.662]  And it was like being punched in the chest and the stomach over and over again to read, for sure they raped us, for sure they're doing it!
[00:18:20.183 --> 00:18:22.064]  I am so freaking pissed, man!
[00:18:22.444 --> 00:18:24.105]  I can't take much more of these people!
[00:18:29.276 --> 00:18:30.441]  And the way it's written!
[00:18:30.461 --> 00:18:32.470]  It's all slimy!
[00:18:33.871 --> 00:18:38.854]  So, I tried to get focused, I tried to get ready, I tried to come on and do a good job, but I blew up the last two segments.
[00:18:39.054 --> 00:18:40.054]  But what I said was true.
[00:18:40.975 --> 00:18:49.380]  I can get more done if I call a bunch of influential people I know and tell them to look into this and let them break it, because I don't care about breaking it, and then it will actually have an effect.
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:55.423]  Instead, the audience is great, but I say so much stuff, people just hear it and just think, oh, that's another thing Alex just said.
[00:18:55.683 --> 00:18:56.363]  No, it's not.
[00:18:56.624 --> 00:19:02.407]  It's the biggest frickin' smoking gun I ever saw, to quote Robert Duvall in Network.
[00:19:04.392 --> 00:19:06.494]  It's a big kidded hit, okay?
[00:19:06.974 --> 00:19:11.237]  I mean, this thing would hurt them so frickin' bad.
[00:19:11.257 --> 00:19:13.058]  I hate the New World Order!
[00:19:13.098 --> 00:19:14.379]  I can't stand Bill Gates!
[00:19:14.619 --> 00:19:15.980]  I can't stand Warren Buffett!
[00:19:16.221 --> 00:19:17.582]  I can't stand Ted Turner!
[00:19:17.842 --> 00:19:20.003]  I can't stand Barack Obama!
[00:19:20.023 --> 00:19:21.424]  I can't stand him anymore!
[00:19:21.444 --> 00:19:24.166]  I want him off my back now, you mothers!
[00:19:27.216 --> 00:19:44.591]  And then I sit there and I read exactly what I was told by my family that works in these damn plants, that they're ordered to go at zero or quarter power under the frickin' federal government because Biden put them back under the son of a bitch two weeks ago.
[00:19:46.253 --> 00:19:51.878]  Now, we all knew that, and everybody talked about it and said, oh, did the Department of Energy do this?
[00:19:52.438 --> 00:19:54.220]  We have the frickin' document.
[00:19:55.253 --> 00:19:57.434]  Now, now you see why maybe I shouldn't be on air.
[00:19:59.815 --> 00:20:00.675]  Let's just say this.
[00:20:00.695 --> 00:20:04.276]  I could probably win a boxing match right now.
[00:20:04.296 --> 00:20:05.077]  That's why I put me in a ring.
[00:20:05.917 --> 00:20:06.637]  I know you could too.
[00:20:06.677 --> 00:20:09.799]  And I don't want violence, folks, but I cannot take it anymore.
[00:20:09.839 --> 00:20:10.019]  Okay?
[00:20:10.399 --> 00:20:11.539]  People say, so you better settle down.
[00:20:11.559 --> 00:20:12.420]  You're gonna have a heart attack.
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:13.300]  Yeah, probably so.
[00:20:19.546 --> 00:20:22.308]  I mean, yesterday, I had like 50 articles.
[00:20:22.648 --> 00:20:23.129]  Type it in.
[00:20:23.429 --> 00:20:26.231]  Texas exceptionalism is to blame for no power.
[00:20:26.491 --> 00:20:27.311]  Texas sucks.
[00:20:27.572 --> 00:20:28.392]  Texas is a joke.
[00:20:28.672 --> 00:20:29.573]  Texans are idiots.
[00:20:29.853 --> 00:20:31.134]  Texas don't know how to do anything.
[00:20:31.374 --> 00:20:32.615]  Texas don't know how to have power.
[00:20:32.895 --> 00:20:34.216]  And I had all the proof.
[00:20:34.256 --> 00:20:38.379]  They turned off over 100 of our coal plants and ERCOTs run by leftists under federal control.
[00:20:38.599 --> 00:20:40.980]  And I knew the windmills failed so often.
[00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:41.901]  I mean, I knew all that.
[00:20:42.121 --> 00:20:42.942]  I knew they were lying.
[00:20:43.442 --> 00:20:49.044]  But to know they're doing it while the Department of Energy ordered them to do it.
[00:20:49.184 --> 00:20:51.145]  Yeah, there's one of the... I mean, these things are everywhere.
[00:20:51.545 --> 00:20:54.967]  It's time to bury the myth of Texas exceptionalism!
[00:20:56.906 --> 00:21:08.928]  Well, I don't want to say I'm exceptional or Texas is exceptional, but compared to the blue cities and blue states we are, and they show an old lady in COVID mask in a wheelchair and everybody hunched over and pathetic because that's who they want you to think you are.
[00:21:09.168 --> 00:21:10.529]  That's why they do the blackouts.
[00:21:10.709 --> 00:21:12.189]  It's why they have the homeless everywhere.
[00:21:12.389 --> 00:21:13.689]  It's why they ship the drugs in.
[00:21:13.889 --> 00:21:15.249]  It's why they defund the police.
[00:21:15.469 --> 00:21:16.650]  It's why they demoralize us.
[00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:21.311]  It's why they have the army officers and others wear red high heels and learn how to get blowjobs.
[00:21:22.771 --> 00:21:23.451]  That's literally done.
[00:21:24.497 --> 00:21:27.085]  It's to demoralize everyone!
[00:21:27.365 --> 00:21:29.371]  And let me just say, it's not demoralizing me!
[00:21:31.016 --> 00:21:32.580]  It's turning me into Captain Caveman!
[00:21:34.403 --> 00:21:46.830]  So, these arrogant Ivy League and globalist EU bureaucrats that run things like ERCOT think you're an idiot and ran this whole thing so they can federalize the grid and bring in the scam and that's the whole next level.
[00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:54.455]  Remember me on Tuesday saying 10,000% increases in prices and people thought, I saw comments, Jones is exaggerating.
[00:21:57.957 --> 00:21:59.018]  Wait till I come back.
[00:22:00.575 --> 00:22:02.795]  I'm gonna try to control myself with my reporter hat on.
[00:22:03.656 --> 00:22:04.416]  Take some deep breaths.
[00:22:05.236 --> 00:22:06.016]  Take some deep breaths.
[00:22:06.616 --> 00:22:13.098]  Take some... Be a friendly, nice little bunny rabbit when I come back.
[00:22:13.238 --> 00:22:23.760]  And I'm gonna show you all the documents and all the proof and people that were getting $100 bills are getting $3,000 bills already from just a few days.
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:28.201]  So I guess the lucky people were the ones that had your power off.
[00:22:29.258 --> 00:22:34.003]  Because those of you that had your power on, oh lordy lordy, and guess what's in the document?
[00:22:35.125 --> 00:22:43.454]  The Department of Energy told Texas, under federal law, you'll be prosecuted unless you exhaust outside power supplies first.
[00:22:44.275 --> 00:22:47.359]  So that was the whole reason, as I told you on Monday, because it's following the Enron plan.
[00:22:48.695 --> 00:23:01.145]  Is they made tens of billions of dollars off Texans alone, these outside power groups, by ordering ERCOT to not up power, and then they had to, under regulations, pay whatever the groups wanted to charge, and they ripped this off!
[00:23:01.405 --> 00:23:14.896]  So on top of killing over 50 people that froze to death, including little kids, and the hundreds that died in car wrecks, and all the rest of it, and all the cattle production, and all the dead cattle, and the milk cows, and the hundreds of millions of gallons of milk getting dumped in the whatever,
[00:23:15.316 --> 00:23:22.481]  On top of all of that and hearing how Texas sucks and how Biden is going to take over Texas and run it now because we don't know how to do anything.
[00:23:23.141 --> 00:23:29.205]  On top of all that, they're gouging the living snot out of us because they're technocrats and we sit here and take it.
[00:23:30.506 --> 00:23:33.868]  And to the governor's credit and the rest of them, I didn't know all this.
[00:23:34.488 --> 00:23:38.551]  They had meteorologists for us even on the news saying, you better get the power grid turned on.
[00:23:38.571 --> 00:23:40.612]  And Abbott was begging the feds to turn the power on.
[00:23:40.832 --> 00:23:44.415]  Hey, how about Abbott, you tell them burn in hell and you turn the fricking power on.
[00:23:46.351 --> 00:23:49.674]  It's not a federal government, it's a CHICOM OCCUPATION FORCE!
[00:23:51.315 --> 00:23:54.517]  I've been on air 27 years and I've never had such a smoking gun.
[00:23:54.537 --> 00:24:00.221]  I got a call Saturday from family.
[00:24:00.421 --> 00:24:01.602]  I didn't return the call till Monday.
[00:24:02.719 --> 00:24:09.605]  And they work in the energy sector, and they said, Alex, you need to look at federal regulations that Trump deactivated but that Biden's reactivated.
[00:24:09.866 --> 00:24:11.327]  And I started interrupting like I do.
[00:24:11.387 --> 00:24:13.629]  I said, oh, the Chinese are allowing our grid.
[00:24:13.689 --> 00:24:14.590]  No, no, no, that's not it.
[00:24:15.391 --> 00:24:21.836]  It's an executive order of Obama, and it's a Department of Energy federal law that Congress passed 10 years ago.
[00:24:23.408 --> 00:24:42.973]  And, ERCOT was meant to come in and manage this for Texas, so that Texas didn't have liability, and the Texas employees didn't have liability, that's how they sold it, was that you had to have an outside corporate group, so you don't have liability running it, and so it's ERCOT, just like Enron, that does the management, and Enron is the model of this.
[00:24:44.116 --> 00:24:51.318]  And we're not allowed, whether it's hydroelectric or whether it is turbine, it doesn't matter.
[00:24:51.978 --> 00:24:58.579]  We have to ask authorization to turn power up, period, because power is seen as dirty regardless of where it came from.
[00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:00.860]  So you need to look into those federal agreements.
[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:03.180]  And then they were telling me the names and stuff and I'm like, okay, I will.
[00:25:03.481 --> 00:25:08.942]  I go on air and I go, I've talked to sources that they weren't allowed to turn the plants up and that they were asking a week before.
[00:25:09.844 --> 00:25:19.769]  So then I'm sitting here about 30 minutes from the show, and one producer walks up and says, hey, the other producer who worked all weekend, who's, you know, or all week is off today, his source in the Department of Energy sent this link.
[00:25:20.349 --> 00:25:21.730]  No one is covering this.
[00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:23.491]  We went to the Department of Energy.
[00:25:23.531 --> 00:25:24.431]  It's on their website.
[00:25:24.591 --> 00:25:25.492]  You can find it yourself.
[00:25:25.812 --> 00:25:26.792]  We'll give you the order number.
[00:25:27.252 --> 00:25:32.755]  And when I read it, I became so angry that I literally, you saw what happened.
[00:25:32.775 --> 00:25:34.956]  That was not me letting the dog off the leash.
[00:25:34.976 --> 00:25:36.497]  That was the dog jumping over the fence.
[00:25:38.103 --> 00:25:39.624]  And you should be angry about this.
[00:25:40.724 --> 00:25:41.945]  This is insane.
[00:25:42.405 --> 00:25:46.507]  DOE 202C Emergency Order ERCOT 02.14.2021.
[00:25:47.748 --> 00:25:59.394]  You can put that in DuckDuckGo, you can put that in Google, put that in Microsoft BingyWingy, all of it, and it comes right up.
[00:25:59.634 --> 00:26:06.278]  And, I mean, man, when you read this, and you know the background, it'll make your blood boil.
[00:26:09.158 --> 00:26:37.465]  They say, okay, governor's begging a week before because they knew this Arctic Vortex was bad and meteorologists are saying it may come down here, so I'll have to give the governor, I've got problems with credit, he was saying quietly, should have been on the news, making a political issue out of this, Abbott and others are saying, and the Department of Energy in Texas is saying, you need, let's call the Railroad Commission here, you need to turn these controls off because we think this is about to hit the state.
[00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:41.273]  And they didn't do it till it already hit.
[00:26:41.834 --> 00:26:42.936]  And it's all right here.
[00:26:43.116 --> 00:26:50.911]  And they told them, according to the code, you've got to use outside power first and you've got to use low emission systems.
[00:26:51.171 --> 00:26:52.333]  Well, the windmills were frozen.
[00:26:53.442 --> 00:26:54.603]  And one of the reactors went out.
[00:26:55.043 --> 00:26:57.966]  And so, Texas always had more power than anybody.
[00:26:57.986 --> 00:27:01.129]  We used to supply, before Obama came in, the states all around us.
[00:27:01.169 --> 00:27:01.569]  Remember that?
[00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:03.551]  Our grid supplied much of the country.
[00:27:04.012 --> 00:27:04.792]  That's why we were proud of it.
[00:27:05.173 --> 00:27:10.417]  Remember, the US under Trump got to where it was the biggest supplier of energy in the world for the first time since the 50s?
[00:27:12.935 --> 00:27:14.656]  And remember, Texas was the main supplier?
[00:27:15.036 --> 00:27:16.257]  But it's all over the news.
[00:27:16.337 --> 00:27:17.358]  Texas is pathetic.
[00:27:17.658 --> 00:27:18.479]  Texas is done.
[00:27:18.759 --> 00:27:19.699]  Texas are idiots.
[00:27:19.899 --> 00:27:21.320]  Oh, Biden's going to federalize them.
[00:27:21.601 --> 00:27:22.981]  Oh, it wasn't those windmills.
[00:27:23.902 --> 00:27:24.382]  Oh, no.
[00:27:24.402 --> 00:27:29.225]  Even Bloomberg went and pulled articles down from days ago admitting it was the windmills.
[00:27:29.406 --> 00:27:30.646]  But it wasn't the windmills, folks.
[00:27:30.847 --> 00:27:32.848]  The windmills were just part of the scam.
[00:27:33.788 --> 00:27:39.652]  It was an order to not allow them to operate.
[00:27:41.233 --> 00:27:42.314]  And then to only do it
[00:27:43.732 --> 00:27:48.636]  From quote, green sources that didn't work and couldn't supply.
[00:27:50.458 --> 00:27:54.081]  But the key is it's about embarrassing Texas.
[00:27:54.141 --> 00:27:55.842]  It's about power and control.
[00:27:55.882 --> 00:27:56.943]  It's about you having less.
[00:27:57.023 --> 00:27:58.324]  It's about you learning.
[00:27:58.564 --> 00:28:01.166]  I said rolling blackouts are coming nationwide the last few years, didn't I?
[00:28:01.447 --> 00:28:02.608]  That's in agenda 21.
[00:28:03.328 --> 00:28:04.149]  That's in agenda 23.
[00:28:04.189 --> 00:28:08.713]  They say we have rolling blackouts to train the public to not have as much and we can charge more for less.
[00:28:09.909 --> 00:28:10.889]  That's what Enron did.
[00:28:11.169 --> 00:28:12.310]  They created carbon credits.
[00:28:12.530 --> 00:28:13.950]  I mean, I was on there 27 years ago.
[00:28:14.170 --> 00:28:18.331]  When Enron went down 20 years ago, I was on there every week covering every facet of it.
[00:28:20.392 --> 00:28:25.653]  And back then it was liberals attacking it like Greg Powell's the BBC, but I had him on because I knew about energy and knew he was right.
[00:28:25.753 --> 00:28:26.854]  Oh, now the left loves this.
[00:28:29.214 --> 00:28:30.275]  So let's look at it right here.
[00:28:31.055 --> 00:28:32.215]  Let's look at these headlines first.
[00:28:32.275 --> 00:28:32.875]  I'm going to come back.
[00:28:32.895 --> 00:28:37.176]  I'm going to read this entire Department of Energy, Washington, D.C., order number 202211.
[00:28:42.415 --> 00:28:44.515]  Which again, they implemented as the storm hit.
[00:28:45.596 --> 00:28:48.056]  And by then, it takes about a week to fire these things up.
[00:28:48.516 --> 00:28:52.817]  So the governor, Abbott, who got an award for the windmills and went along with it, and so did Rick Perry.
[00:28:53.137 --> 00:28:54.058]  It's terrible and doesn't work.
[00:28:54.398 --> 00:28:55.478]  I was blaming him for everything.
[00:28:55.818 --> 00:28:58.599]  The truth is, he's in here demanding that they do this.
[00:28:58.619 --> 00:28:59.639]  But he should have gone on the news.
[00:28:59.959 --> 00:29:02.459]  He should have been political and exposed them.
[00:29:02.719 --> 00:29:03.940]  But he didn't, did he?
[00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:05.320]  He's a good Republican.
[00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:06.340]  He's a gentleman.
[00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:09.341]  He's not going to say the feds aren't letting us turn the power on.
[00:29:11.018 --> 00:29:12.279]  So they can then turn around and blame him.
[00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:14.381]  They act like little kids.
[00:29:16.723 --> 00:29:18.205]  What they are is scared of the mainstream media.
[00:29:18.225 --> 00:29:19.366]  What they are is wimps.
[00:29:20.147 --> 00:29:25.011]  DOE, Department of Energy Order number 202-21-1.
[00:29:26.152 --> 00:29:26.693]  Look it up.
[00:29:26.753 --> 00:29:27.474]  Don't believe me.
[00:29:29.756 --> 00:29:31.217]  But let's hit some of these headlines first.
[00:29:31.237 --> 00:29:31.557]  Look at this.
[00:29:31.938 --> 00:29:35.161]  Millions of freezing Americans trying to hold on without heat and water.
[00:29:38.991 --> 00:29:39.832]  Voice of America.
[00:29:40.492 --> 00:29:41.093]  Here's another one.
[00:29:41.393 --> 00:29:43.554]  Texas was seconds from complete disaster.
[00:29:43.574 --> 00:29:45.316]  Yeah, I told you this on Monday.
[00:29:46.036 --> 00:29:55.603]  Saturday night, if they didn't get the power from outside states and couldn't turn up their systems, the whole grid almost failed, and then trying to power it up is next to impossible.
[00:29:55.783 --> 00:29:59.246]  They said it would have been two to six months of no power.
[00:30:00.627 --> 00:30:02.308]  So this is really Texas being held hostage.
[00:30:03.837 --> 00:30:10.041]  And then instead of blaming the Department of Energy, oh, we're supposed to all grovel to them now and then they'll come in and take over and gouge us and triple charge us.
[00:30:10.061 --> 00:30:11.522]  That's why Texas has such cheap power.
[00:30:11.723 --> 00:30:16.586]  Everybody's moving here because Texas said we're not going to join your UN program and up the power prices.
[00:30:16.626 --> 00:30:17.627]  We're going to have our own power.
[00:30:17.847 --> 00:30:19.288]  Well, it's all basically already been shut off.
[00:30:20.791 --> 00:30:30.774]  On Thursday, ERCOT officials said the Texas power grid was seconds and minutes away from catastrophic failure that could have left Texans in the dark for months.
[00:30:30.814 --> 00:30:31.375]  That was yesterday.
[00:30:31.695 --> 00:30:36.016]  They should know ERCOT is the entity that operates the power grid for most of the state.
[00:30:36.216 --> 00:30:38.417]  They said it could have been months and months.
[00:30:40.165 --> 00:30:41.385]  ZeroHedgeInfoWars.com.
[00:30:41.405 --> 00:30:44.066]  Remember I covered this three days ago, four days ago?
[00:30:44.366 --> 00:30:45.886]  It was all a big joke in the media.
[00:30:46.046 --> 00:30:47.327]  Oh sure, right, Jones claim.
[00:30:47.867 --> 00:30:48.227]  Reuters.
[00:30:48.487 --> 00:30:53.288]  Texas wholesale electric prices spiked more than 10,000% amid outages.
[00:30:53.988 --> 00:30:57.709]  And what does this little sweet document show that I'll show you the print of next segment?
[00:30:58.809 --> 00:31:01.670]  They had to first only buy from outside sources.
[00:31:03.228 --> 00:31:06.009]  Including available imports and demand response.
[00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:12.373]  You look those terms up, that means demand response is a term meaning outside power when you don't have enough.
[00:31:12.493 --> 00:31:13.793]  Demand response is a key term.
[00:31:13.813 --> 00:31:15.814]  It means you buy from available imports.
[00:31:16.595 --> 00:31:17.935]  These are all lawyer terms.
[00:31:18.276 --> 00:31:19.596]  I'll show it to you here in a moment.
[00:31:20.977 --> 00:31:25.379]  Texas wholesale electric prices spiked more than 10,000% and here it is today.
[00:31:26.119 --> 00:31:28.741]  This is a real statement breakdown.
[00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:36.424]  Where people were paying $50 per megawatt in Texas, now they're getting $9,000 per megawatt.
[00:31:36.464 --> 00:31:38.286]  I can't wait to hear what our power bill will be here.
[00:31:39.927 --> 00:31:41.368]  My lord, man, we should go bankrupt.
[00:31:41.828 --> 00:31:43.469]  People were paying $68, $50, $100, $200, now paying $3,702.
[00:31:43.509 --> 00:31:48.373]  The rolling blackouts that plugged 15 million Texans into darkness amid the historic cold snap are
[00:31:59.807 --> 00:32:01.530]  Diminishing by the end of the week.
[00:32:02.251 --> 00:32:06.138]  About 188K customers were without power in the state on Friday morning.
[00:32:06.499 --> 00:32:09.083]  Days after power prices jumped more than $50 per megawatt to $9,000.
[00:32:15.711 --> 00:32:17.352]  Power bills to the moon!
[00:32:17.713 --> 00:32:18.233]  Chaos!
[00:32:18.313 --> 00:32:19.554]  Shock as electricity prices!
[00:32:20.054 --> 00:32:21.916]  It's the same playbook, folks.
[00:32:22.516 --> 00:32:24.738]  And I told you what was coming.
[00:32:25.098 --> 00:32:28.741]  You think I just sit up here and like, oh yeah, Jones really sounds like he knows what he's talking about.
[00:32:28.781 --> 00:32:29.922]  He talks really fast, too.
[00:32:29.962 --> 00:32:32.765]  Like, it's probably made up.
[00:32:33.345 --> 00:32:35.066]  How about that power bill you're going to get in the mail?
[00:32:35.667 --> 00:32:39.270]  Tune in to me on Monday and Tuesday saying you're going to get 10, 15 times the power bill.
[00:32:39.610 --> 00:32:42.993]  And then tune in, and then now that it comes to the mail, ask, am I telling you the truth?
[00:32:45.506 --> 00:32:52.813]  So we're going to come right back and read to you the document, they don't want you to see, that I hope you care about and I hope everybody in the country covers.
[00:32:53.233 --> 00:32:56.756]  I don't give a rat's ass about that we broke this, I just want to stop these monsters.
[00:32:57.797 --> 00:33:01.120]  Alright folks, this is Smoking Gun
[00:33:02.574 --> 00:33:06.756]  Political coffin nails for Obama and for the deep state and for the globalists.
[00:33:06.776 --> 00:33:15.820]  That's why they put the censorship in ahead of the election fraud, ahead of opening the borders, ahead of defunding the police, ahead of defunding the dollar, ahead of their takedown of the nation.
[00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:17.361]  I've got all that evidence coming up next hour.
[00:33:18.781 --> 00:33:22.203]  The truth can't be on air or they will end up going to prison.
[00:33:24.292 --> 00:33:36.358]  And that's why this transmission is so key, and you telling everybody about the local Aminathem station you're listening to, or the local TV station or cable station you're watching, or Band.Video, or InfoWars.com.
[00:33:36.398 --> 00:33:40.320]  So, let me just lay it out very quickly for new listeners, and then I'm going to get into the document.
[00:33:42.521 --> 00:33:50.545]  We know there's Department of Energy agreements with the power grids around the country to not exceed certain greenhouse gas emissions that was put in by Obama.
[00:33:51.601 --> 00:34:00.827]  Texas tried to buck it, was in a bunch of big lawsuits under Rick Perry and then under Greg Abbott that went on forever, trying to block some of it.
[00:34:01.287 --> 00:34:05.951]  Perry agreed to some windmills, Abbott even more, thought that would satiate the left.
[00:34:06.831 --> 00:34:13.275]  Texas spending tens of billions of dollars on these worthless things that don't supply good power on their way out in West Texas.
[00:34:13.696 --> 00:34:17.258]  Because, you know, Boone Pickens, the fake oil guy and all that was involved.
[00:34:19.159 --> 00:34:19.820]  That wasn't enough.
[00:34:21.351 --> 00:34:41.461]  And so it turns out, days and days before the storm hits, the Texas government went to the Department of Energy and said, okay, federal law says, because Trump had rescinded it, and I'll show you, Biden had just redone the executive orders where they could go to prison as climate criminals if you put out CO2 without authorization.
[00:34:43.101 --> 00:34:43.962]  I'm going to read this to you.
[00:34:45.102 --> 00:34:45.943]  And they came to them,
[00:34:47.608 --> 00:34:52.231]  And they said, uh, we have an emergency in the legislation that we can do this.
[00:34:52.472 --> 00:34:59.337]  And they waited a full three, four days until Saturday, until the power already went off.
[00:34:59.777 --> 00:35:05.141]  And Ercot called the feds and said, we won't be able to turn it on for two months to six months.
[00:35:05.161 --> 00:35:05.901]  That's in the news here.
[00:35:05.921 --> 00:35:08.223]  I don't just believe this Department of Energy.
[00:35:08.243 --> 00:35:09.444]  We can follow it from researching.
[00:35:10.871 --> 00:35:14.993]  Ercott calls and goes, okay, the whole grid's going completely down, and there's not enough power from the outside.
[00:35:15.393 --> 00:35:17.214]  Oh, we'll let you increase power now.
[00:35:17.435 --> 00:35:21.337]  We wanted to bleed you and sell you 10,000% more expensive power.
[00:35:22.317 --> 00:35:26.359]  Okay, you can turn up some of your plants, but only enough to keep your grid up.
[00:35:26.379 --> 00:35:28.841]  You'll go to jail if you turn it up any higher.
[00:35:30.455 --> 00:35:38.499]  For those that don't know about coal plants and others, they have inspectors with guns on their hips, they fly Cessnas over the smokestacks trying to find anything but carbon dioxide.
[00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:49.025]  The plants were so clean, American technology was so exceptional, that by the 90s they could find nothing, not sulfur, not mercury, nothing but water vapor and carbon dioxide.
[00:35:49.285 --> 00:35:51.726]  So they passed regulations saying carbon dioxide is poison.
[00:35:52.507 --> 00:35:53.087]  The plants breathe.
[00:35:55.515 --> 00:35:58.798]  And so, yeah, I was saying, hey, they shut down 120 plants.
[00:35:59.118 --> 00:36:00.239]  Hey, these windmills don't work.
[00:36:00.279 --> 00:36:01.039]  That's what caused this.
[00:36:01.079 --> 00:36:03.961]  And I'm like, but wait a minute, Enron ran scams on the West Coast like this.
[00:36:04.022 --> 00:36:11.607]  It made billions a day by rolling blackouts so the public would accept higher prices, believing it was a scarce commodity that came out in court was their plan.
[00:36:12.468 --> 00:36:14.049]  I said, I bet that's the same thing again.
[00:36:14.369 --> 00:36:24.057]  And sure as hell, and as sure as Santa Claus wears a red and white outfit, and as sure as mama loves her baby, that's what they did.
[00:36:25.393 --> 00:36:29.399]  So, oh, Texas declared itself a small government paradise, now it's frozen in it.
[00:36:29.679 --> 00:36:30.981]  Oh, Texas is pathetic.
[00:36:31.041 --> 00:36:31.241]  No.
[00:36:32.583 --> 00:36:38.352]  So they got all their publications out saying who did this, and all Ted Cruz has got to do to change the subject.
[00:36:39.936 --> 00:36:47.400]  All Greg Abbott has to do to redeem himself, all John Cornyn has to do is come out and read this on air and it's game over.
[00:36:47.701 --> 00:36:50.782]  By the way, I've had my problems with Ted Cruz, but I think he's a good constitutionalist.
[00:36:51.483 --> 00:36:54.765]  Ken Coon is like going out to get a cheeseburger in Texas.
[00:36:54.925 --> 00:36:56.706]  It's an hour and 45 minute flight.
[00:36:57.086 --> 00:36:58.307]  His daughters were going down there.
[00:36:58.627 --> 00:37:02.769]  Why do I care if he flew down there with his daughters to get out of this hell when it turned out his power was off?
[00:37:03.070 --> 00:37:04.210]  My power was off a bunch.
[00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:05.691]  My water just came back today.
[00:37:05.991 --> 00:37:07.052]  Most folks still don't have water.
[00:37:09.258 --> 00:37:10.498]  They're out of school, why not go?
[00:37:10.638 --> 00:37:12.619]  Mexico, see, we live by Mexico, folks.
[00:37:13.319 --> 00:37:13.999]  We go down there.
[00:37:14.059 --> 00:37:15.239]  But I'm not even defending that.
[00:37:15.559 --> 00:37:16.540]  How is that the news?
[00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:20.560]  How is he horrible and the Democrats are all, oh, look, he doesn't care about you.
[00:37:21.621 --> 00:37:22.721]  He didn't want the lockdowns.
[00:37:22.901 --> 00:37:23.981]  He didn't want to wear the mask.
[00:37:24.121 --> 00:37:26.882]  It's not like he's for a lockdown and he's caught getting out of one.
[00:37:27.822 --> 00:37:30.223]  No, it's not like all the Democrats caught on private jets.
[00:37:30.543 --> 00:37:36.284]  No, he was flying in coach with his daughters down there to get them through customs.
[00:37:38.311 --> 00:37:40.013]  But I'm not even defending Ted Cruz.
[00:37:40.033 --> 00:37:40.734]  That's not what it's about.
[00:37:40.794 --> 00:37:45.961]  It's about this Department of Energy document, order number 202211.
[00:37:48.944 --> 00:37:51.608]  Let me start reading this to you, and I'll go over it more in the next hour, but here it is.
[00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:58.824]  And again, Adon Salazar, our only writer able to get in with the Frozen Roads, that's here, he's doing an article on this right now.
[00:37:59.104 --> 00:38:00.625]  And the document's on Infowars.com.
[00:38:00.645 --> 00:38:01.566]  But don't get it from there.
[00:38:01.986 --> 00:38:10.232]  Snopes will say, or NewsGuard run by George Soros and Bill Gates, literally, I got a story on that next hour, they will just say it's not real.
[00:38:10.292 --> 00:38:14.194]  So you go to the Department of Energy document, you go to their website, and you see it for yourself.
[00:38:14.234 --> 00:38:17.196]  Just type in Department of Energy, order number 202-21-1.
[00:38:20.768 --> 00:38:25.232]  And you'll click the little linky-winky and you'll be on it for yourself.
[00:38:26.994 --> 00:38:28.375]  There is the URL for you.
[00:38:30.097 --> 00:38:32.138]  But let's just right now read this part.
[00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:42.148]  Pursuant to the authority vested in the Secretary of Energy by Section 202C of the Federal Power Act, FPA 16 U.S.C.,
[00:38:45.597 --> 00:38:52.760]  834AC and Section 301B of the Department of Energy Organization Act, 42 U.S.C.
[00:38:53.601 --> 00:39:13.309]  7151B, and for the reasons forth below, I hereby determine that an emergency exists in Texas due to a shortage of electric energy, a shortage of facilities for generation of electric energy and other causes, and that issuance of an order will meet the emergency and severity of the public interest.
[00:39:14.554 --> 00:39:15.536]  And serve the public interest.
[00:39:17.099 --> 00:39:18.161]  Now why is that so important?
[00:39:19.143 --> 00:39:20.426]  Because this is issued
[00:39:23.624 --> 00:39:26.646]  On Saturday, when the storms already hit, the power is already going out.
[00:39:27.066 --> 00:39:30.548]  Oh, so once we're already in the Atlantic Ocean freezing to death, now they come to help.
[00:39:30.928 --> 00:39:42.335]  ERCOT, who's their willing accomplice obviously, is the beginning stages of an unprecedented cold weather event brought on by rare southward exclusion of the jet stream into the south central United States.
[00:39:42.635 --> 00:39:49.299]  Temperature for Sunday and Monday in many parts of Texas are forecast to drop well below the lowest temperatures experienced in several decades.
[00:39:49.519 --> 00:39:51.721]  Turns out it's an all-time record since we took temperatures.
[00:39:52.561 --> 00:39:56.105]  And abnormally low temperatures are expected to persist for several more days.
[00:39:56.485 --> 00:40:05.555]  The weather event is expected to result in a record winter electricity demand that will exceed ERCOT's most extreme seasonal load forecast.
[00:40:06.496 --> 00:40:09.079]  I'm gonna go to break and read you the rest of it, but this is where it gets interesting.
[00:40:09.459 --> 00:40:11.541]  They say, under our environmental orders,
[00:40:12.619 --> 00:40:19.024]  You're not allowed to turn up your plants unless we say, and you've got to first buy power from outside the state, and it goes on from there.
[00:40:19.384 --> 00:40:27.910]  So that just shows you who is in control of the Texas energy grid, and that the governor and others, days and days before it hit, were like saying, please take off the restrictions, please.
[00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:35.235]  And they say, no, that will hurt the environment and will release carbon that plants breathe, and so you're not allowed to.
[00:40:35.555 --> 00:40:41.159]  But we will allow you to buy power from outside the state so we can charge you 10,000% more, but we're going to wait.
[00:40:42.366 --> 00:40:47.007]  Cause there'd be lower bids and stuff it was on days before, till you're in an emergency on Saturday night.
[00:40:47.227 --> 00:40:47.887]  How's that sound?
[00:40:48.507 --> 00:40:49.227]  Perfect timing.
[00:40:49.708 --> 00:40:50.608]  Oh, we didn't.
[00:40:50.768 --> 00:40:54.829]  Cause, cause they know if they totally never allowed it, the governor would say the feds did it.
[00:40:55.789 --> 00:40:57.509]  But see instead, Oh, no, no, no, no.
[00:40:57.909 --> 00:41:04.171]  Once we threw you overboard into the water, we threw you a life vest, push you off the ship and 12 foot waves, 20 foot waves.
[00:41:04.371 --> 00:41:05.311]  You're like, Oh, help me.
[00:41:05.391 --> 00:41:06.531]  Oh, here's a life vest.
[00:41:06.591 --> 00:41:07.351]  Oh, you didn't get it.
[00:41:07.371 --> 00:41:08.412]  Oh, bye-bye.
[00:41:08.512 --> 00:41:09.452]  I gave you a life vest.
[00:41:09.512 --> 00:41:10.032]  I'm a hero.
[00:41:13.143 --> 00:41:14.824]  Wait till I lay this all out next hour.
[00:41:14.864 --> 00:41:17.465]  It's smoking gun, smoking gun.
[00:41:17.525 --> 00:41:18.805]  I've never seen anything like this.
[00:41:20.066 --> 00:41:21.846]  You need to get this out to everyone you know.
[00:41:21.946 --> 00:41:22.807]  It's so incredible.
[00:41:23.407 --> 00:41:24.888]  But it's written in bureaucrat speech.
[00:41:24.908 --> 00:41:26.428]  All right, we're going to go to break.
[00:41:26.808 --> 00:41:37.813]  Seriously, a lot of people noticed in the videos we were running that we shot in the dark here with generators running the studios that, hey, that's my Patriot supply from a former store, but why is the packaging tan and not black?
[00:41:38.553 --> 00:41:42.176]  Well, that's because that's food I got like four years ago and they changed the packaging three years ago.
[00:41:42.517 --> 00:41:44.759]  Need to be thicker, better internal packaging.
[00:41:45.299 --> 00:41:52.786]  So see, we have a warehouse literally in the building with a 10-year food supply for a family of four people, which is enough for my crew for about a month.
[00:41:53.621 --> 00:41:55.422]  And yeah, people are like, what's that room?
[00:41:56.062 --> 00:42:02.344]  And it's like a room of water filters and a room of giant, you know, big water cooler deals of spring water.
[00:42:03.304 --> 00:42:07.325]  Yeah, we got safes, too, with guns, shotguns and rifles in them.
[00:42:08.186 --> 00:42:09.286]  50 cals and everything.
[00:42:09.486 --> 00:42:11.286]  Because we know what we're going into, see?
[00:42:11.306 --> 00:42:14.788]  I don't just sit there and go, oh, you need storable food right now.
[00:42:14.888 --> 00:42:16.748]  And then like, I've got my new packaging.
[00:42:16.808 --> 00:42:18.129]  Oh, look, it's a black package.
[00:42:18.409 --> 00:42:19.309]  I'm just eating this.
[00:42:19.669 --> 00:42:20.749]  It's not just an ad, folks.
[00:42:20.969 --> 00:42:22.210]  We're eating the oldest food.
[00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:30.924]  I've got six-year-old food at my house, and three-year-old food, and one-year-old food, and the rest I gave to the deer hunters and family before it started going bad.
[00:42:31.064 --> 00:42:35.286]  We all enjoyed it at Big Cookouts, and I gave the rest to the homeless shelters.
[00:42:36.997 --> 00:42:40.039]  It's insurance you can eat, but yeah, it lasts more than 10 years.
[00:42:40.099 --> 00:42:43.341]  When my food gets 10 years old, I mean, I've given away food at least twice.
[00:42:43.761 --> 00:42:47.984]  Food I bought 20 years ago, food I bought 10 years ago, I gave away and it was still delicious.
[00:42:48.484 --> 00:42:50.545]  But now the storable food's gotten so much tastier.
[00:42:51.406 --> 00:42:56.209]  Even my Patriot, stuff from four years ago is good, but it's not the new stuff.
[00:42:56.249 --> 00:42:57.890]  I was like, hey, why you guys got the old stuff?
[00:42:58.570 --> 00:43:00.491]  We got a whole room right here with the new stuff.
[00:43:00.651 --> 00:43:01.351]  We didn't think, sir.
[00:43:01.391 --> 00:43:02.231]  We just grabbed the first.
[00:43:02.612 --> 00:43:04.412]  I'm like, okay, just get the black stuff.
[00:43:04.492 --> 00:43:04.852]  It's better.
[00:43:05.433 --> 00:43:06.773]  The brown package stuff's okay.
[00:43:06.793 --> 00:43:07.353]  I got a bunch of it.
[00:43:07.373 --> 00:43:07.754]  It's good.
[00:43:07.814 --> 00:43:11.895]  But the black package stuff is new and even better and more delicious.
[00:43:12.295 --> 00:43:12.856]  I'm just telling you.
[00:43:13.216 --> 00:43:16.877]  And it's 10% off at InfoWarsTore.com, an emergency sale.
[00:43:16.897 --> 00:43:18.078]  10% off, ready to ship to you right now.
[00:43:18.798 --> 00:43:19.998]  10% off InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:43:20.018 --> 00:43:20.519]  Get prepared.
[00:43:21.659 --> 00:43:26.361]  You know, I grew up, especially my dad's mom, with all the canned foods and the emergency preparedness.
[00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:30.421]  Because the ant prepares, the grasshopper dies in winter.
[00:43:31.141 --> 00:43:36.242]  You watch all these fancy pants, know-it-all trendies that sit there and make fun of us that are prepared.
[00:43:36.362 --> 00:43:41.344]  And hell, I wasn't totally prepared with all the lockdowns and the power being out for more than a day and the rest of it.
[00:43:43.444 --> 00:43:51.286]  But when I saw the news come out and make fun of Texas and attack us everywhere and say how pathetic we are because we didn't have power and how it was our fault, I didn't know all about the grid.
[00:43:51.646 --> 00:43:54.787]  I obsessed over it because I knew it was how they were going to target us in the future.
[00:43:56.328 --> 00:43:57.328]  And I was right again, wasn't I?
[00:43:58.442 --> 00:43:59.402]  Because they're technocrats.
[00:43:59.422 --> 00:44:05.965]  They're going to take every fancy, complex system that we're not in control of, and they're going to rip us off with us.
[00:44:06.065 --> 00:44:10.627]  And now it all came together exactly what I already knew they'd done before.
[00:44:10.947 --> 00:44:12.328]  They did again, but even bigger.
[00:44:12.348 --> 00:44:14.269]  And it's so smoking gun that I...
[00:44:16.072 --> 00:44:17.493]  I'm trying to control myself right now.
[00:44:17.553 --> 00:44:18.753]  I'm probably taking years off my life.
[00:44:18.793 --> 00:44:19.334]  I'm so angry.
[00:44:20.354 --> 00:44:22.055]  But it's just a forte.
[00:44:22.115 --> 00:44:23.096]  It's a hors d'oeuvre.
[00:44:23.216 --> 00:44:24.196]  It's a prelude.
[00:44:24.536 --> 00:44:25.537]  It's a first taste.
[00:44:25.637 --> 00:44:26.977]  It's an icebreaker.
[00:44:28.078 --> 00:44:33.221]  It's just the vanguard of what we are about to experience.
[00:44:34.481 --> 00:44:36.042]  And I know this in myself.
[00:44:36.942 --> 00:44:38.003]  And I know this intellectually.
[00:44:39.144 --> 00:44:40.144]  And so we need to get mad.
[00:44:40.164 --> 00:44:45.907]  Like he says in Network, he goes, I don't want you to write your congressman, I don't know what to even tell you to write, but I just know this first, you got to get mad.
[00:44:46.127 --> 00:44:47.468]  You got to say, I'm a human being!
[00:44:49.208 --> 00:44:54.371]  My life has value and I'm not going to sit here and take this globalist dehumanization.
[00:44:54.611 --> 00:44:58.912]  Because every elite throughout history wants to make their people poor and control them and tell them everything's their fault.
[00:44:58.992 --> 00:44:59.893]  That's how this always works.
[00:45:00.113 --> 00:45:04.555]  With all our robots and computers and everything, the metrics, we should be working two days a week, living like kings.
[00:45:06.698 --> 00:45:11.222]  But instead, they just sabotage the whole system and manipulate it to keep us poor and dumbed down.
[00:45:12.383 --> 00:45:13.224]  It's a real paradox.
[00:45:14.045 --> 00:45:15.046]  So I'm going to control myself.
[00:45:15.066 --> 00:45:15.926]  I'm going to take a deep breath.
[00:45:17.007 --> 00:45:23.313]  When we come back, I'm going to plunge in and read this whole document on air that is the smoking gun of smoking guns of smoking guns.
[00:45:23.473 --> 00:45:25.535]  And it better go back viral.
[00:45:25.635 --> 00:45:26.876]  Everybody else better write about it.
[00:45:26.956 --> 00:45:28.538]  I don't want any attention or credit.
[00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:31.921]  Bill Gates attacked me yesterday.
[00:45:33.539 --> 00:45:41.601]  And a bunch of articles, and I called Paul Watson this morning and I said, I want you to write an article about this, but just don't include that he's attacking me because they'll block it if that happens.
[00:45:41.921 --> 00:45:48.462]  Just talk about how he got caught paying for fake news articles about himself and claiming that India didn't block the COVID vaccine.
[00:45:49.362 --> 00:45:52.503]  So he wrote a big article about it and I had myself not put in it.
[00:45:53.603 --> 00:45:57.464]  Because I don't care about being the big dog or, oh, we broke another story, aren't we great?
[00:45:57.724 --> 00:45:59.024]  I care about beating these people.
[00:46:00.845 --> 00:46:06.249]  But I do want you to go get the Infowars.com article and send everyone you know and go, here's Bill Gates paying the fact-checkers.
[00:46:07.069 --> 00:46:14.094]  And he even owns the fact-checking group saying his vaccine's totally safe when we have Zuckerberg internal video saying he doesn't trust it!
[00:46:15.215 --> 00:46:20.998]  While he censors me, and you, and everybody else, including Tucker Carlson, for saying the same damn thing.
[00:46:29.264 --> 00:46:30.285]  So, the feds
[00:46:31.584 --> 00:46:34.887]  Didn't let Texas turn its power on and up its power output.
[00:46:34.907 --> 00:46:42.353]  And it just shows how Texas, how the governor and others before him, Rick Perry as well, signed us over through ERCOT.
[00:46:42.913 --> 00:46:46.696]  Rick Perry's on Fox talking trash about the windmills.
[00:46:46.877 --> 00:46:48.378]  Hey buddy boy, you're the one that started it!
[00:46:48.558 --> 00:46:50.360]  And it's not about driving you into the ground.
[00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:56.585]  It's about, I'm not going to sit there and watch you not take credit for what you did, son!
[00:46:58.649 --> 00:47:00.531]  And that damn governor we got over there!
[00:47:01.112 --> 00:47:03.715]  Halfway, I'm glad he was at least saying, hey, let's turn the power on.
[00:47:03.935 --> 00:47:08.661]  Why wasn't he in the damn press conference on Wednesday and Thursday and Friday when he was begging behind the scenes?
[00:47:09.041 --> 00:47:10.123]  Blaming it on the feds.
[00:47:10.703 --> 00:47:13.246]  Because he's bought and paid for, he doesn't want to mess with them.
[00:47:13.467 --> 00:47:14.848]  He's gonna let them screw us!
[00:47:15.967 --> 00:47:19.408]  He's like, oh, this is really gonna hurt Texas, you need to stop.
[00:47:19.428 --> 00:47:26.070]  So he, like a lawyer, he sent the letter, so he can't be held culpable for that, but then he let him F us over.
[00:47:26.831 --> 00:47:28.631]  So now I've changed my mind, now I've thought about it.
[00:47:28.751 --> 00:47:30.552]  I actually hate Greg Abney the bar!
[00:47:32.693 --> 00:47:33.713]  You little lawyer!
[00:47:34.633 --> 00:47:36.154]  You little son of a, you know what?
[00:47:38.175 --> 00:47:44.497]  I was thinking, oh, that was nice of him to try to get our power on, but he didn't say a damn word publicly, because all he was doing was covering his little ass.
[00:47:45.868 --> 00:47:58.495]  That's why we're in the position we're in as a bunch of lawyers, a bunch of candy-ass lawyers, covering their ass so much, the Chinese are running the tables on us, getting ready to nuke our ass, because you little chicken-net-America-hating bastards have taken over the damn country!
[00:48:03.977 --> 00:48:06.399]  We'll be right back.
[00:48:06.419 --> 00:48:12.302]  Okay, my friends, I had intended to come in today, and open the phones up for the entire four-hour broadcast,
[00:48:14.667 --> 00:48:23.332]  Including clearing the deck in the fourth hour of our great guest host, Dr. Dick Begich, so I can take your phone calls from medical workers, doctors, nurses, about what you're seeing with the COVID-19 vaccine.
[00:48:24.493 --> 00:48:29.236]  Because as I suspected, it's not just certain nursing homes and hospitals are having mass deaths from the vaccine.
[00:48:29.556 --> 00:48:31.518]  Those are the ones that aren't corrupt that are reporting the truth.
[00:48:31.538 --> 00:48:35.800]  I mean, we're talking about up to 5% of people dying that take it, that are old.
[00:48:37.641 --> 00:48:39.683]  And again, we don't just pull that out of our rear end, do we?
[00:48:41.590 --> 00:48:47.593]  No, we have the British Ministry of Defense, who was administering it two months ago, said, uh-oh, whoa, hold your horses one weekend.
[00:48:48.053 --> 00:48:49.514]  We're getting a lot of old folks dying.
[00:48:49.994 --> 00:48:56.518]  Don't take this if you're above 75, pregnant, or 16 or younger.
[00:48:57.418 --> 00:49:01.940]  But I got articles flooding in from the Vatican, where if people don't take it, they're fired.
[00:49:03.721 --> 00:49:04.922]  And I got articles flooding in
[00:49:06.735 --> 00:49:13.159]  Where a pregnant woman was a waitress and she was fired because she wouldn't take it even though it's not even approved for pregnant women.
[00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:16.981]  And you got all these women having miscarriages when they take it.
[00:49:17.241 --> 00:49:20.543]  That business owner shouldn't know your medical history.
[00:49:20.783 --> 00:49:23.585]  That business owner shouldn't know that you're even pregnant.
[00:49:24.534 --> 00:49:26.195]  But see how HIPAA's out the door?
[00:49:26.475 --> 00:49:28.215]  All our rights are out the door just suddenly?
[00:49:28.475 --> 00:49:29.736]  Oh, we don't do medical tests?
[00:49:29.976 --> 00:49:31.156]  We don't do medical studies?
[00:49:31.617 --> 00:49:34.978]  Oh, now your employer knows what your vaccine history is?
[00:49:35.258 --> 00:49:38.339]  This is a stampeding of our rights and our freedoms.
[00:49:38.759 --> 00:49:43.961]  Infowars.com, New York City waitress fired at refusing to cover vaccine, fearing it could cause infertility.
[00:49:44.401 --> 00:49:47.323]  Well, that's just what the head of the EU Commission said, who's a top scientist.
[00:49:50.564 --> 00:49:53.665]  And I'm going to hit that, and I'm going to take your calls, and I'm going to do it.
[00:49:54.724 --> 00:50:04.567]  But, man, I just, I don't feel sorry for myself, but I'm overloaded.
[00:50:05.007 --> 00:50:20.192]  The Communist Chinese official government spokesperson came out and said, don't criticize our death camps with a million Christians, a million Buddhists, and three million Muslims in them, the Falun Gong, all of it, who are basically Buddhist light.
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:29.907]  You can't even feed your people, and America's a broken state, and they're making fun of Texas, when Texas was the main energy supplier for much of the U.S.
[00:50:30.207 --> 00:50:39.295]  until Obama got in and shut our plants off, and I have the smoking gun document that the Department of Energy was in control and not letting them up the plants.
[00:50:39.355 --> 00:50:41.577]  But that's on record under the law!
[00:50:41.697 --> 00:50:43.139]  I read you the law last hour!
[00:50:45.302 --> 00:50:58.391]  But Bloomberg and AP and Reuters and the New York Times, the Washington Post, the LA Times, the Austin American States and the Houston Chronicle, the Dallas Morning News, they all gang up on Texas and say Texas is pathetic.
[00:50:58.931 --> 00:51:00.632]  It can't even keep a light bulb on.
[00:51:00.853 --> 00:51:02.234]  They can't put a rocket in space.
[00:51:02.514 --> 00:51:05.015]  Everybody knows Texans can't wipe their butts.
[00:51:07.597 --> 00:51:09.939]  They certainly can't find their ass with both hands.
[00:51:13.376 --> 00:51:19.638]  And again, I have so much knowledge just living in Texas and like half my family working in power plants, oil and gas.
[00:51:19.678 --> 00:51:21.998]  They just rotate through and oil and gas is a boom.
[00:51:22.898 --> 00:51:23.358]  They're in that.
[00:51:23.598 --> 00:51:25.879]  When it's not, they go into the power generation.
[00:51:27.079 --> 00:51:32.541]  My whole life, drive around as a little kid, go visit family.
[00:51:32.641 --> 00:51:35.301]  Oh, we got to go do a geology test on an oil field.
[00:51:35.321 --> 00:51:40.983]  Let's drive two hours or hear people talk about power plant generation all day and the EPA.
[00:51:41.003 --> 00:51:42.043]  I mean, I know this stuff.
[00:51:43.137 --> 00:51:53.587]  And I talked to family, and I talked to others, and they said, hey Alex, you gotta go look up, the feds are in control of our power plants, it's in the federal law, Obama did it, we're not allowed to turn the power on, and I knew that and I said it!
[00:51:55.328 --> 00:52:02.956]  Sunday and Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday, but I didn't show you the document, and I'm just reading it, made me so angry.
[00:52:05.643 --> 00:52:06.983]  That I almost turned this desk over.
[00:52:07.043 --> 00:52:07.703]  Seriously, man.
[00:52:07.723 --> 00:52:08.144]  But you know what?
[00:52:08.164 --> 00:52:10.164]  That's a normal response to learning.
[00:52:10.644 --> 00:52:12.064]  They're not just robbing our future.
[00:52:12.104 --> 00:52:12.945]  They're blaming us.
[00:52:12.985 --> 00:52:14.025]  They're starving people.
[00:52:14.225 --> 00:52:15.665]  They're bankrupting all these communities.
[00:52:15.705 --> 00:52:17.126]  They've killed over 50 people.
[00:52:17.466 --> 00:52:25.468]  And then now they're going to rape us more and are telling us permanent blackouts because the feds put ERCOT in control because you can't have the state managing it.
[00:52:29.108 --> 00:52:29.689]  It's incredible.
[00:52:30.729 --> 00:52:31.709]  So you read the document.
[00:52:34.082 --> 00:53:02.620]  Order number 202211, put out Saturday by the Department of Energy, and it's the governor, days before, begging them to turn the power on, but they say, well, you know, we've got these laws saying you're not allowed to turn your plants up because of carbon output, but we have a waiver power in the federal law that allows us to do it, so they waited until
[00:53:04.193 --> 00:53:14.378]  Saturday, and I actually even found articles where ERCOT admits this, but ERCOT doesn't mention the Feds, that if they didn't up power by Saturday night, it would have been a multi-month long power outage.
[00:53:15.659 --> 00:53:17.060]  And we're still getting rolling blackouts here.
[00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:18.320]  You're like, well, just have generators.
[00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:19.181]  We've got the generators.
[00:53:19.401 --> 00:53:21.222]  You know what happens when the power goes on and off the generators?
[00:53:21.482 --> 00:53:22.342]  It blows stuff.
[00:53:22.402 --> 00:53:23.043]  Things trip.
[00:53:24.023 --> 00:53:25.764]  It's like a haunted house in this place right now.
[00:53:26.144 --> 00:53:26.985]  I'm not complaining.
[00:53:27.345 --> 00:53:29.046]  This is what it is to be third world, folks.
[00:53:33.012 --> 00:53:36.915]  So they said to preserve the reliability of the bulk electric power system.
[00:53:38.956 --> 00:53:45.680]  ERCOT requests that the Secretary issue an order immediately effective February 14th through February 19, 2021.
[00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:50.664]  Notice they asked days before, but they say, oh, now it's this date.
[00:53:51.264 --> 00:53:56.608]  Authorizing the provision of additional energy from all generation units subject to emissions
[00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:11.825]  When you read the law on that, not coal, folks, or other permit limits, and I went and looked up the permit limits, and sure as the devil wears the red pajamas, it says they're not allowed to do it.
[00:54:13.308 --> 00:54:14.629]  Oh, you can up the windmill power?
[00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:15.550]  Oh, sorry, they're frozen.
[00:54:16.311 --> 00:54:28.203]  In the ERCOT region, that's Texas, the generating unit specified resources that this order pertains to are listed on the order 202-21-1 resource list as described below.
[00:54:28.663 --> 00:54:32.988]  And it's, oh, hydroelectric, and it's, oh, this, it takes them a week to turn a coal plant up.
[00:54:33.428 --> 00:54:34.009]  Didn't let them do that.
[00:54:35.538 --> 00:54:55.050]  EPA Section 202C2 requires the Secretary of Energy to ensure that any 202C order that may result in a conflict with the requirement of any environmental law limit to the hours necessary to meet the emergency and serve the public interest and to the maximum extent that is practical.
[00:54:56.974 --> 00:55:02.860]  Be consistent with the applicable environmental law and minimize any adverse environmental impacts.
[00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:04.141]  This is all felonies, okay?
[00:55:04.622 --> 00:55:18.096]  ERCOT anticipates this order may result in exceedance of emissions of carbon dioxide and water, of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, mercury, and carbon monoxide emissions, as well as wastewater release limits.
[00:55:18.396 --> 00:55:20.118]  Another reason the water plants got shut down.
[00:55:20.598 --> 00:55:33.151]  To minimize adverse environmental impacts, the order limits operation of dispatch units, get rid of that definition, what that means, to the times and with the parameters determined by ERCOT with reliability purposes.
[00:55:33.171 --> 00:55:35.533]  And that all speaks to the law and what they're allowed to turn on.
[00:55:37.035 --> 00:55:38.756]  Didn't let them turn the coal power plants up, folks.
[00:55:40.049 --> 00:55:44.570]  Part B. To minimize adverse environmental... We're going to come back and read all this.
[00:55:44.610 --> 00:55:45.911]  It gets really bad right here.
[00:55:46.591 --> 00:55:47.931]  It's really, really bad.
[00:55:48.131 --> 00:55:49.932]  But the point is, the feds are in control.
[00:55:50.312 --> 00:55:55.233]  The feds wouldn't let them up the power till the power grid was going down and then limited what they could do.
[00:55:55.453 --> 00:55:58.954]  And then sat back and said, Texas is a bunch of idiots, a bunch of hayseeds.
[00:55:59.254 --> 00:56:02.375]  Oh, I'm watching hee-haw right now.
[00:56:02.775 --> 00:56:04.996]  Oh, Joe Biden gonna take me over.
[00:56:05.316 --> 00:56:07.397]  Joe Biden knows how to cook a possum.
[00:56:07.757 --> 00:56:08.277]  Oh, yeah.
[00:56:09.980 --> 00:56:13.941]  Now, when I say this, it isn't about, oh, look, I'm so smart.
[00:56:14.041 --> 00:56:15.122]  It's like, we're smart.
[00:56:16.402 --> 00:56:21.063]  And the minute the crew came to me, I remembered a whole other constellation of information.
[00:56:21.123 --> 00:56:28.786]  One of the producers came to me and he said, this is about time of use, thermostat control, where they claim, oh, we don't have enough power.
[00:56:28.826 --> 00:56:30.847]  We've got to control your house by remote control.
[00:56:30.907 --> 00:56:38.469]  And he gave me a whole stack of news articles, CNBC, AP, Reuters, Zero Hedge, you name it, CDC, all of it being admitted.
[00:56:40.282 --> 00:56:41.242]  The CDC's another one.
[00:56:41.562 --> 00:56:42.382]  Wait till you see this one.
[00:56:42.683 --> 00:56:44.003]  It's an orgy of info, folks.
[00:56:44.083 --> 00:56:44.923]  Wait till I hit that one.
[00:56:47.003 --> 00:56:49.904]  But what did I go post yesterday?
[00:56:49.924 --> 00:56:51.124]  Already seems like 100 years ago.
[00:56:52.545 --> 00:56:55.445]  Or two days ago on the ERCOT energy system.
[00:56:56.625 --> 00:56:58.346]  Because the politicians, they pass the buck.
[00:56:58.366 --> 00:57:02.507]  They go, oh, like Enron or like ERCOT, we'll just hand it over to some corporate group.
[00:57:03.527 --> 00:57:08.588]  With people in Canada, in Germany, and they're all leftists, by the way.
[00:57:10.740 --> 00:57:12.622]  All this is environmental terrorism.
[00:57:13.083 --> 00:57:14.184]  What did I post on their door?
[00:57:14.324 --> 00:57:19.910]  Notice to Globalist Criminals, ERCOT Chairwoman Sally Talberg and other accomplices.
[00:57:20.771 --> 00:57:29.821]  Whistleblowers inside your organization as well as the EPA and Texas government are preparing to come forward and expose your giant Enron style scam.
[00:57:31.135 --> 00:57:40.741]  You are hereby ordered by the people to cease and desist your staged blackout designed to condition Americans to accept the Great Reset and carbon credit rationing.
[00:57:41.102 --> 00:57:46.705]  Just as Governor Cuomo will be sent to prison for his crimes against humanity, you too will be held accountable.
[00:57:47.126 --> 00:57:57.032]  One last time, we are aware of your criminal enterprise to trick the public into accepting smart meters and monitoring of thermostats to jack up power prices as much as 10,000%.
[00:57:57.713 --> 00:58:00.775]  Stop your criminal activity now when the people are watching.
[00:58:03.609 --> 00:58:04.892]  Now, why is that so important?
[00:58:04.973 --> 00:58:09.585]  Because I showed you earlier today, people with $100 bills are getting $3,000 bills.
[00:58:12.349 --> 00:58:13.710]  That had their power on during this.
[00:58:14.471 --> 00:58:16.252]  So I guess you're lucky if your power was off.
[00:58:16.692 --> 00:58:21.496]  But they do this as a formula to train you to accept double, triple, quadruple prices.
[00:58:22.317 --> 00:58:23.638]  And that's why they give you blackouts.
[00:58:23.658 --> 00:58:24.499]  That's what Enron did.
[00:58:24.519 --> 00:58:29.863]  I know I keep saying that because if we don't have power and cheap power, we don't have a country.
[00:58:30.363 --> 00:58:32.445]  This is as big a tax as the income tax.
[00:58:32.825 --> 00:58:34.607]  Or as your social security tax, FICA.
[00:58:36.008 --> 00:58:37.149]  This is globalist war.
[00:58:42.930 --> 00:58:48.717]  Yeah, the ERCOT board meeting last week included jokes about cowboy boots, less than 40 seconds of storm talk.
[00:58:50.139 --> 00:58:51.560]  So let's read the key parts here.
[00:58:51.941 --> 00:58:59.810]  B. To minimize adverse environmental impacts, the order from the federal government... Again, the takeaway is the feds are in control of Texas power.
[00:59:00.050 --> 00:59:01.632]  They're acting like Texas did this.
[00:59:02.133 --> 00:59:02.754]  No, they're in control.
[00:59:03.933 --> 00:59:13.279]  To minimize adverse environmental impacts, this order limits operation of dispatch units to the times and within parameters described by ERCOT for reliability purposes.
[00:59:13.639 --> 00:59:21.965]  Consists with good utility practice, ERCOT shall exhaust all reasonably and practically available resources, including available imports.
[00:59:22.585 --> 00:59:25.587]  That's the $10,000, 10,000% increase.
[00:59:25.967 --> 00:59:29.350]  That's the billions they just made, including available
[00:59:30.814 --> 00:59:52.127]  Imports demand response and identify behind the meter generation resources selected to minimize and increase in emissions evil carbon to the extent that such resources provide support to maintain grid reliability prior to dispatching specified resources.
[00:59:54.549 --> 00:59:56.430]  That's David
[00:59:59.224 --> 01:00:01.865]  Or whatever you say it, Acting Secretary of Energy.
[01:00:02.745 --> 01:00:04.906]  So there it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:05.326 --> 01:00:08.287]  The smoking gun of smoking guns.
[01:00:08.767 --> 01:00:18.530]  The feds in control of the Texas energy grid ordering them to use outside power so they could charge us 10,000% more.
[01:00:20.810 --> 01:00:22.891]  And this is the creature that actually physically did it.
[01:00:24.164 --> 01:00:24.624]  There he is.
[01:00:25.404 --> 01:00:27.145]  You know, he's being taken care of.
[01:00:27.165 --> 01:00:28.285]  You can check his Swiss bank accounts.
[01:00:28.706 --> 01:00:29.366]  So let's continue.
[01:00:30.386 --> 01:00:31.827]  Here's Reuters, just to give you background.
[01:00:32.827 --> 01:00:35.708]  Texas wholesale electric prices spiked more than 10,000% amid outages.
[01:00:40.231 --> 01:00:41.172]  Oh, follow the money, folks.
[01:00:41.792 --> 01:00:55.421]  Outages morph into outages and outrage as Texas slapped with mind-blowing power bills that go from $50 per megawatt to $9,000 a megawatt.
[01:00:55.481 --> 01:00:57.763]  I'm not a mathematician off the top of my head.
[01:00:58.123 --> 01:00:58.403]  What is $50?
[01:00:58.563 --> 01:01:03.166]  Guys, will you divide $50 into $9,000 for me and please give me the number?
[01:01:03.987 --> 01:01:06.248]  What is the price increase of $50 to $9,000?
[01:01:06.369 --> 01:01:07.329]  Sounds to me $50
[01:01:10.871 --> 01:01:14.974]  If you divide it, it's way more than a 10,000%.
[01:01:15.574 --> 01:01:24.820]  Because if you're from 50 to 9,000, that sounds like 18,000 times increase.
[01:01:25.300 --> 01:01:27.782]  I'm just like, because you know, nine's not 10.
[01:01:27.822 --> 01:01:30.383]  It'd be very easy if it was 10,000% increase from 50.
[01:01:30.744 --> 01:01:35.307]  We would know what that was, but that sounds like a 18,000% increase.
[01:01:35.547 --> 01:01:36.607]  Let's see how dumb I am.
[01:01:36.647 --> 01:01:37.008]  Let's see.
[01:01:37.668 --> 01:01:38.108]  It is, boom.
[01:01:38.128 --> 01:01:38.949]  So just off the top of my head,
[01:01:40.199 --> 01:01:42.860]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:44.901]  An 18,000% increase!
[01:01:44.921 --> 01:01:47.881]  I mean, here's the deal, folks.
[01:01:48.142 --> 01:01:49.982]  These criminals can't help but steal and rob.
[01:01:50.022 --> 01:01:51.142]  That's why they're going to end up failing.
[01:01:51.863 --> 01:01:54.023]  That's the good news is these people can't help themselves.
[01:01:54.183 --> 01:01:55.144]  They're not like masterminds.
[01:01:55.184 --> 01:01:56.884]  They just go, we control the power grid.
[01:01:57.044 --> 01:01:57.905]  We can rip them off.
[01:01:57.945 --> 01:01:58.185]  Do it!
[01:01:59.662 --> 01:02:07.665]  It's like Hitler, like, I can attack North Africa, I can attack England, I can attack France, I can attack Austria, I can attack Poland, I can attack the Russians!
[01:02:07.885 --> 01:02:11.127]  I mean, it's like, attack, attack, attack, attack!
[01:02:11.407 --> 01:02:13.708]  And that's what they're going to do until you finally say no.
[01:02:16.309 --> 01:02:17.169]  But that's what they're doing.
[01:02:19.659 --> 01:02:22.140]  So, I mean, they can't help it.
[01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:27.661]  If you don't say no to them, and if you're not aware of them, you're like, hey, you increased prices 18,000%.
[01:02:28.921 --> 01:02:29.701]  Shut up, racist.
[01:02:30.522 --> 01:02:35.763]  If you play that game with them and let them be the authority, they will do nothing but rape you forever.
[01:02:38.884 --> 01:02:41.084]  So, 18,000% increase.
[01:02:42.285 --> 01:02:43.325]  Little secret about my brain.
[01:02:44.434 --> 01:02:46.695]  Is that I can't do basic math if I try, but I don't worry about it.
[01:02:46.715 --> 01:02:48.535]  I know the math answers, but it's easy stuff.
[01:02:49.076 --> 01:02:51.997]  Now, let's sit here and let's talk about this right now.
[01:02:52.737 --> 01:02:53.757]  Because here's where we are.
[01:02:54.137 --> 01:02:55.598]  There's still a lot of the state without power.
[01:02:55.638 --> 01:02:56.618]  People dying everywhere.
[01:02:56.878 --> 01:02:58.059]  The cows die and everything.
[01:02:58.299 --> 01:02:59.479]  It's liberal though, so it doesn't matter.
[01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:07.402]  Millions freeze, trying to hold on without heat and water.
[01:03:09.994 --> 01:03:12.236]  Texas was seconds from complete disaster.
[01:03:12.256 --> 01:03:22.245]  Zero Hedge, Infowars.com, ERCOT now admits it would have been out for months and months if the feds hadn't signed the agreement on Saturday to let them turn up the power.
[01:03:23.346 --> 01:03:25.849]  Since when did the federal government run Texas?
[01:03:25.949 --> 01:03:28.171]  Because you're all hearing, Texas did this, remember?
[01:03:28.611 --> 01:03:31.014]  Texas, it's not about me and Texas pride.
[01:03:32.807 --> 01:03:33.708]  But I live around here.
[01:03:33.948 --> 01:03:41.496]  We used to have so much power plants, we were supplying 15 states, and that's why Obama came in and cut it off, because Texas was his own damn country!
[01:03:42.877 --> 01:03:46.501]  We got so much natural gas, so much oil, and so much coal.
[01:03:46.521 --> 01:03:51.406]  I remember my grandma when I was about 15 years old, she goes, should I let them lignite mine the farm?
[01:03:52.705 --> 01:04:02.317]  Because we've sold out most of the ranch property and stuff, and we're like, no, let's not let them bulldoze these hundreds of thousands of oak trees and pine trees, and they didn't do the lignite mine there.
[01:04:02.337 --> 01:04:10.266]  But these giant machines come in, and they just scoop off the topsoil, grab the lignite, and then replant it, and it looks even prettier after they're done.
[01:04:11.167 --> 01:04:14.549]  The point is I know about this stuff, okay, is what I'm telling you.
[01:04:14.829 --> 01:04:18.271]  And this is the biggest screw job ever imagined.
[01:04:18.571 --> 01:04:24.334]  Texas is like the energy sector next to Saudi Arabia.
[01:04:24.394 --> 01:04:25.115]  We're it, baby.
[01:04:25.815 --> 01:04:28.056]  Oh, Saudi Arabia can't keep their lights on.
[01:04:28.296 --> 01:04:29.317]  Neither can Venezuela.
[01:04:29.477 --> 01:04:33.919]  They got almost as much as oil as Texas, but they're run by commies and commies love to starve you.
[01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:35.360]  I want to be clear.
[01:04:35.420 --> 01:04:36.701]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:04:36.721 --> 01:04:40.163]  We have Billy Corrigan bringing us in.
[01:04:42.227 --> 01:04:43.928]  I want to be totally clear with you.
[01:04:45.308 --> 01:04:47.329]  I massively prepared for this show.
[01:04:48.129 --> 01:04:57.813]  I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 stacks of news that I scanned over and read and I've not even hit.
[01:04:58.574 --> 01:05:02.155]  Because most talk show hosts hit like one story, a segment, and they go, oh, coming up is this.
[01:05:02.555 --> 01:05:02.815]  No!
[01:05:03.896 --> 01:05:04.096]  No!
[01:05:05.757 --> 01:05:20.540]  NO I WILL NOT SIT HERE AND WATCH THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY OVERRIDE TRUMP'S EXECUTIVE ORDERS AND TELL TEXAS THEY COULDN'T INCREASE POWER WHEN I HAVE THE SMOKING GUN!
[01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:22.421]  I just want to see this all over the news.
[01:05:22.541 --> 01:05:23.881]  I want to see them go to prison.
[01:05:25.081 --> 01:05:26.522]  I want to see Cuomo go to prison.
[01:05:27.302 --> 01:05:29.122]  Maybe that's something I'll pre-empt this for.
[01:05:29.142 --> 01:05:30.343]  Cuomo was in a press conference.
[01:05:30.363 --> 01:05:32.083]  I was getting a cup of coffee about 30 minutes ago.
[01:05:33.683 --> 01:05:35.865]  I was so angry about this, I didn't come tell the crew to get it.
[01:05:36.246 --> 01:05:42.473]  He was, again, blaming the internet and Twitter for people mad that he killed 16,000 old people on purpose.
[01:05:45.336 --> 01:05:46.897]  So, here's the deal, ERCOT.
[01:05:48.103 --> 01:05:50.964]  And I want to be clear, ERCOT's just a little management front company.
[01:05:51.264 --> 01:05:55.365]  So the state of Texas goes, we're not going to run this scam, even though you're giving us lobbying money.
[01:05:56.126 --> 01:06:00.147]  Here, a private group runs it, and then they can charge us 10,000 times more.
[01:06:00.587 --> 01:06:01.467]  Abbott's in on it.
[01:06:01.808 --> 01:06:02.968]  Perry was in on it.
[01:06:03.248 --> 01:06:04.809]  They're all Enron creatures.
[01:06:04.849 --> 01:06:05.989]  The Bushes were in on it.
[01:06:06.309 --> 01:06:07.409]  The Clintons are in on it.
[01:06:07.690 --> 01:06:08.590]  It's all horrible, OK?
[01:06:10.762 --> 01:06:23.750]  But now it's here, and they're gonna tell Texans, you're pathetic, look at you wearing masks, and you're starving, and you're just, oh, you're not exceptional, it's you just mismanaged it, you dumb bastards.
[01:06:24.070 --> 01:06:27.993]  You just got as much power as Saudi Arabia and a much bigger grid.
[01:06:28.013 --> 01:06:33.856]  It's like telling Mike Tyson in 1989 that he couldn't fight.
[01:06:35.577 --> 01:06:36.418]  It's a joke.
[01:06:38.740 --> 01:06:41.621]  It's time to bury the myth of Texas exceptionalism.
[01:06:42.162 --> 01:06:44.342]  And they show an old woman in a wheelchair wearing a mask.
[01:06:44.743 --> 01:06:46.443]  Well, hey, those folks may be buried.
[01:06:46.623 --> 01:06:47.144]  We're not.
[01:06:47.884 --> 01:06:48.944]  I know about energy.
[01:06:49.325 --> 01:06:51.686]  I know about petroleum geology.
[01:06:51.846 --> 01:06:53.847]  I know all about it, you jerks.
[01:06:56.168 --> 01:06:56.648]  And I know.
[01:06:58.251 --> 01:07:04.135]  But I got a phone call Saturday, Sunday, and Monday saying, Jones, look into the fact that we're ordered not to produce energy.
[01:07:04.576 --> 01:07:17.865]  And I just said, all my family says, and my son's contacts say, they're not allowed to increase energy, instead of the document that, thank God, folks reached out to us and pointed out was their Department of Energy Order Number 202-21-1.
[01:07:17.885 --> 01:07:26.452]  That ought to be on the political gravestone.
[01:07:27.682 --> 01:07:28.302]  Oh, Joe Biden.
[01:07:31.443 --> 01:07:32.963]  That ought to be hung around his neck!
[01:07:35.063 --> 01:07:36.724]  That ought to be his crown of thorns!
[01:07:38.524 --> 01:07:41.205]  That he signed, and I got the executive order right here, I'll show it to you.
[01:07:41.445 --> 01:07:50.466]  He signed an executive order a week and a half ago saying that, yeah, Texas couldn't override this because Trump has rescinded it, and then that big storm comes in right on time.
[01:07:50.826 --> 01:07:53.247]  I mean, wow, this illustrates everything.
[01:07:55.385 --> 01:07:59.647]  Executive order on tackling the climate crisis at home and abroad.
[01:07:59.887 --> 01:08:03.369]  There's another one they call re-establishing science.
[01:08:04.009 --> 01:08:11.552]  Yeah, carbon dioxide's poison, it kills plants, and you can't have it, and so...
[01:08:14.491 --> 01:08:23.618]  ERCOT has been alerted that numerous generator units will be unable to operate at full capacity without violating federal air quality and other permit limitations.
[01:08:23.678 --> 01:08:26.641]  Yeah, folks, I haven't even scratched the surface of this.
[01:08:28.102 --> 01:08:28.943]  But here's the bottom line.
[01:08:29.643 --> 01:08:31.945]  Let's say you love carbon taxes, you love the U.S.
[01:08:31.965 --> 01:08:38.070]  not having any power, Europe having no power, only China, India, and Mexico, and every other third world country where globals are invested.
[01:08:38.350 --> 01:08:41.813]  You like it, you fetishize it, you want to be bankrupt and starving in the dark.
[01:08:42.213 --> 01:08:42.914]  Okay, fair enough.
[01:08:45.595 --> 01:08:49.880]  Texas was ordered not to use its power plants even though they shut down over 120.
[01:08:50.301 --> 01:08:58.410]  We still had enough power and enough backup with like huge rail cars full of coal.
[01:08:58.670 --> 01:09:03.116]  They could just flip switches and turn up the power and they were told sorry can't use that.
[01:09:04.881 --> 01:09:10.046]  You've got to buy it from outside states at $10,000.
[01:09:10.547 --> 01:09:11.968]  Sorry, that was three days old.
[01:09:11.988 --> 01:09:12.789]  $18,000 times.
[01:09:12.809 --> 01:09:13.810]  $18,000 times the price.
[01:09:13.830 --> 01:09:16.293]  But it's like Biden.
[01:09:22.873 --> 01:09:25.175]  Increased the price of insulin seven times.
[01:09:25.555 --> 01:09:29.238]  The average price of a prescription drug went up at least 100%.
[01:09:29.518 --> 01:09:31.960]  But it's alright, he's got a bunch of caps on his teeth.
[01:09:32.180 --> 01:09:33.260]  He's an old dirty lawyer.
[01:09:33.521 --> 01:09:34.341]  He's liberal!
[01:09:34.581 --> 01:09:35.902]  Hell yeah, baby!
[01:09:36.183 --> 01:09:37.704]  Pay more for your drugs!
[01:09:37.984 --> 01:09:38.744]  Screw Trump!
[01:09:39.025 --> 01:09:39.705]  Woo!
[01:09:39.965 --> 01:09:41.226]  Let's all freeze to death!
[01:09:41.406 --> 01:09:43.708]  Because Joe Biden's wearing an aviator outfit.
[01:09:45.469 --> 01:09:46.350]  God help me, man.
[01:09:46.630 --> 01:09:47.731]  This is so surreal.
[01:09:49.397 --> 01:09:51.278]  The public is going to be forced to get informed.
[01:09:51.618 --> 01:09:53.558]  The public is going to be forced to learn about this.
[01:09:53.959 --> 01:09:55.399]  You think I want to study these people?
[01:09:55.419 --> 01:09:57.560]  You think I want to read Department of Energy documents all day?
[01:09:57.580 --> 01:10:05.143]  Look at these other articles.
[01:10:06.603 --> 01:10:07.563]  And I've got the documents.
[01:10:07.603 --> 01:10:08.744]  I've got all these documents here.
[01:10:09.704 --> 01:10:11.105]  I've got all the Department of Energy documents.
[01:10:11.525 --> 01:10:17.048]  I've got the Executive Order on Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science.
[01:10:17.608 --> 01:10:21.210]  Oh, to tackle the climate crisis.
[01:10:21.690 --> 01:10:22.370]  Joe Biden.
[01:10:24.311 --> 01:10:26.372]  Notice I just told you this a few minutes ago, now I'm showing it to you.
[01:10:26.392 --> 01:10:27.573]  I don't make any of this up, okay?
[01:10:29.253 --> 01:10:30.574]  Oh, here, here, let's look at it right here.
[01:10:31.294 --> 01:10:32.595]  Oh, this is a very important part of this.
[01:10:35.316 --> 01:10:36.077]  Executive Order 3139...
[01:10:39.968 --> 01:10:45.972]  13920, May 1st, 2020, repealed, is hereby suspended for 90 days.
[01:10:46.352 --> 01:10:48.394]  The Secretary of Energy did this a week and a half ago.
[01:10:48.774 --> 01:10:56.639]  As Director of OMB shall jointly consider whether to recommend that a replacement is issued.
[01:10:56.959 --> 01:11:01.822]  So they suspended Trump's order on not letting China in our grid and protecting the grid.
[01:11:05.657 --> 01:11:09.460]  There's a really important article on InfoWars.com that you do not want to share with anybody.
[01:11:09.841 --> 01:11:13.964]  The temporary collapse of Texas is foreshadowing the total collapse of the United States!
[01:11:14.285 --> 01:11:14.965]  Michael Snyder!
[01:11:15.366 --> 01:11:16.006]  Uh, yeah!
[01:11:16.306 --> 01:11:19.069]  If you can collapse us, you can collapse anybody.
[01:11:21.691 --> 01:11:23.173]  People are like, Jones, how are you taking it?
[01:11:23.433 --> 01:11:24.153]  How am I taking it?
[01:11:24.774 --> 01:11:26.295]  I'm just getting it first because I'm strong.
[01:11:27.236 --> 01:11:27.837]  See how that works?
[01:11:30.472 --> 01:11:32.973]  I think it's a mistake that this operation comes out of Texas?
[01:11:32.993 --> 01:11:35.374]  Think it's a mistake Kennedy got his head blown off down here?
[01:11:53.916 --> 01:11:55.859]  People are ready to take action down here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:11:55.879 --> 01:11:56.921]  I'm not defending what happened to Kennedy.
[01:11:57.282 --> 01:12:01.329]  I'm just saying the New World Order is playing with a lot of fire.
[01:12:02.170 --> 01:12:04.615]  And they take our kindness as weakness because they're stupid.
[01:12:05.888 --> 01:12:19.843]  Because they haven't studied history and they have no idea about people dedicated to an idea, dedicated to their family, dedicated to God, dedicated to war, to defend it if need be, and it doesn't matter if most of the public's in a trance.
[01:12:20.283 --> 01:12:21.505]  Here's the news, baby!
[01:12:21.905 --> 01:12:27.411]  I'm not in a trance, you're not in a trance, and we know what's going on, and we're not putting up with it.
[01:12:29.153 --> 01:12:30.694]  It's all about spiritual energy.
[01:12:31.514 --> 01:12:32.615]  Everything is about energy.
[01:12:33.315 --> 01:12:36.997]  And as long as you don't submit to Biden and the new world order, you're not under his control.
[01:12:37.517 --> 01:12:46.241]  No matter if you're homeless in a ditch, as long as you have a connection to God, you are greater than Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton and these hunchback demon pigs.
[01:12:48.268 --> 01:12:53.736]  Alright, I'm going to shift gears and hit the gigantic, over-the-top Bill Gates COVID-19 news that is absolutely critical.
[01:12:53.777 --> 01:12:58.424]  Then I'll take two hours of your phone calls, as promised from medical workers, to tell your testimony.
[01:12:58.804 --> 01:13:01.569]  Just be ready because I'm going to let you talk and I'm going to shut up before I have a heart attack.
[01:13:03.024 --> 01:13:07.769]  Separately and briefly, we have 10% off all storable food, even though it's already the lowest price out there.
[01:13:07.789 --> 01:13:08.650]  They can barely do this.
[01:13:08.990 --> 01:13:11.432]  It cuts into my profits and their profits to fund the operation.
[01:13:11.632 --> 01:13:15.656]  I'm not bitching, but most storable foods, either 1,000 calories, ours is 2,000.
[01:13:16.037 --> 01:13:16.878]  Ours is packed well.
[01:13:16.938 --> 01:13:17.538]  It's high quality.
[01:13:17.558 --> 01:13:18.119]  It's delicious.
[01:13:18.359 --> 01:13:19.740]  It's 2,000 calories or more.
[01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:23.744]  And by the time you look at everything, there's not a lot of profit.
[01:13:23.824 --> 01:13:25.586]  But the good news is we sell a lot of it.
[01:13:25.946 --> 01:13:27.288]  People go, wow, this is a good deal.
[01:13:27.768 --> 01:13:29.570]  Great packaging, ready to ship to you right now.
[01:13:29.650 --> 01:13:33.113]  High quality food, 2,000 plus calories, or at least 2,000 per item.
[01:13:33.173 --> 01:13:33.714]  It varies.
[01:13:33.974 --> 01:13:34.935]  They're all at least 2,000.
[01:13:35.315 --> 01:13:36.616]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:13:36.636 --> 01:13:37.597]  They've got the coffee.
[01:13:37.957 --> 01:13:39.138]  They've got all the condiments.
[01:13:39.158 --> 01:13:40.460]  They've got all the side packages.
[01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:41.941]  They've got all the special foods.
[01:13:41.961 --> 01:13:46.185]  They've got gigantic warehouses like the Death Star can be built inside of them.
[01:13:46.545 --> 01:13:48.107]  So, Infowarsstore.com.
[01:13:49.974 --> 01:13:50.974]  We'll be right back next hour.
[01:13:50.994 --> 01:13:51.555]  Stay with us.
[01:13:51.575 --> 01:13:52.375]  I hate watching.
[01:14:17.901 --> 01:14:20.363]  A bunch of stuff suit Ivy League people.
[01:14:20.383 --> 01:14:25.786]  Talking about how dumb we are and screwing us over and lying about us and making fun of us.
[01:14:25.846 --> 01:14:29.288]  At the end of the day, I just want to see them fail.
[01:14:30.209 --> 01:14:31.549]  But more importantly, I want to see you.
[01:14:31.569 --> 01:14:34.871]  I want to see you succeed.
[01:14:37.353 --> 01:14:38.854]  Okay, here's the deal.
[01:14:39.034 --> 01:14:40.375]  I intend to do the whole show today.
[01:14:40.455 --> 01:14:42.636]  Phone calls from medical workers about COVID-19.
[01:14:44.306 --> 01:14:48.167]  And all the deaths that have happened to old folks and others that are taking the vaccines.
[01:14:48.187 --> 01:14:50.068]  We're getting so many of those calls without even trying to get them.
[01:14:50.448 --> 01:14:52.108]  I thought, well, just line these suckers up.
[01:14:52.148 --> 01:14:56.669]  And if you call in and love it, you think it's as good as pumpkin pie, then you can call in too.
[01:14:56.689 --> 01:14:57.590]  We're not censoring your call.
[01:14:57.610 --> 01:14:58.250]  We'd love to hear from you.
[01:14:58.270 --> 01:15:01.571]  We're not like the left that just packages one idea and pushes for that.
[01:15:02.151 --> 01:15:03.311]  My God, damn me to hell.
[01:15:03.351 --> 01:15:04.031]  That's where I am.
[01:15:04.071 --> 01:15:04.852]  That's not who I am.
[01:15:04.892 --> 01:15:06.372]  I believe in your free will.
[01:15:09.313 --> 01:15:10.193]  But I want to do two things.
[01:15:10.213 --> 01:15:12.674]  I want to open the phones up on two topics in the next hour.
[01:15:13.675 --> 01:15:21.883]  Ahead of Max Keiser joining us on Bitcoin surging, and then Joel Skousen on the lockdowns and the power outages and the climate lockdowns that are coming.
[01:15:22.844 --> 01:15:24.685]  I want to take an hour of phone calls coming up.
[01:15:24.765 --> 01:15:25.806]  I mean, right to your calls.
[01:15:26.107 --> 01:15:28.068]  Did a pretty good job yesterday, took about 30 calls.
[01:15:28.088 --> 01:15:30.270]  I want to take even more, but just get ready.
[01:15:30.290 --> 01:15:30.991]  I'm going to go to you quick.
[01:15:32.152 --> 01:15:33.013]  Or try to go to you quick.
[01:15:35.095 --> 01:15:35.735]  It's a big show.
[01:15:35.755 --> 01:15:36.496]  We have a lot of callers.
[01:15:36.516 --> 01:15:37.277]  We have 20 phone lines.
[01:15:38.848 --> 01:15:39.649]  But two questions.
[01:15:40.370 --> 01:15:56.288]  What do you make of this Department of Energy document admitting that we're in control of Texas power, we didn't let you turn your power on until Saturday night, once the lockdown and the power outage already happened, and it had to be quote, environmentally sensitive stuff, and you had to buy the power from outside states at 10,000% the prices.
[01:15:56.708 --> 01:15:59.532]  I mean, all of that is just incredible.
[01:16:00.697 --> 01:16:12.483]  And the fact that they would do that and try that, and that Ted Cruz isn't criticizing it, Governor Abbott isn't criticizing it, just like a lot of Republicans will criticize big tech censorship and never do anything, it's because they're really on the payroll.
[01:16:13.764 --> 01:16:18.487]  And I'm not saying Cruz is bad, I'm not saying Abbott's totally bad, I'm just saying they're not men.
[01:16:19.855 --> 01:16:23.897]  They ain't got the huevos rancheros that, I mean, because here's the deal.
[01:16:23.978 --> 01:16:25.038]  I'm not selling out to anything.
[01:16:25.078 --> 01:16:27.400]  You can put a gun on my head, line my kids up if you want.
[01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:29.801]  It's just, that's the power I've got over the enemies.
[01:16:29.901 --> 01:16:30.962]  I don't give a damn.
[01:16:32.143 --> 01:16:33.623]  And I'm not trying to act like a tough guy here.
[01:16:33.744 --> 01:16:36.585]  I'm just sick of people playing both sides.
[01:16:36.865 --> 01:16:38.006]  I mean, look, dumbasses.
[01:16:38.246 --> 01:16:41.408]  Hey, Ted Cruz, you ever had the New World Order offer you $10 million?
[01:16:41.488 --> 01:16:42.549]  Probably not, buddy boy.
[01:16:44.030 --> 01:16:45.451]  I had that 15 years ago.
[01:16:47.253 --> 01:16:49.194]  So, why are you flying coach on Southwest?
[01:16:49.274 --> 01:16:50.094]  It's because you sold out.
[01:16:50.535 --> 01:16:56.958]  I'm not putting you down, I'm not a fat cat saying, hey dude, lookit, you'd have the whole wealth of universe, you're a leader, you're smart.
[01:16:57.378 --> 01:16:59.339]  Stop kissing the system's ass.
[01:16:59.399 --> 01:17:00.920]  Go to war, Cruz.
[01:17:01.820 --> 01:17:03.101]  Or he is in Austin being harassed.
[01:17:04.742 --> 01:17:06.662]  Cancun's like flying to Dallas.
[01:17:06.762 --> 01:17:07.823]  It's an hour and a half away.
[01:17:08.063 --> 01:17:08.964]  Big deal he went there.
[01:17:11.085 --> 01:17:15.787]  He should have attacked the Democrats and ERCOT and the Department of Energy and then gone there.
[01:17:18.146 --> 01:17:20.767]  Actually, I wouldn't let my daughters go to Cancun unless I went with them.
[01:17:22.688 --> 01:17:23.608]  But none of that matters.
[01:17:23.728 --> 01:17:24.968]  He didn't call for the lockdown.
[01:17:25.008 --> 01:17:29.950]  He wasn't like the Austin mayor on a private jet during a lockdown, partying with no mask on in Cancun.
[01:17:29.970 --> 01:17:35.352]  Because folks that don't live in Texas, like Cancun's like, especially if you're in South Texas.
[01:17:35.392 --> 01:17:37.572]  I mean, South Texas is an hour away.
[01:17:37.953 --> 01:17:39.433]  Austin, it's an hour and 40 minutes away.
[01:17:40.813 --> 01:17:42.074]  I'm not defending Ted Cruz.
[01:17:42.954 --> 01:17:45.155]  I want Ted Cruz to go to war for me.
[01:17:47.844 --> 01:17:51.445]  He's got all the cards, but he's too smart, isn't he?
[01:17:52.306 --> 01:17:56.227]  But Ted Cruz is way better than Greg Abbott, and way better than John Cornyn.
[01:17:57.228 --> 01:18:05.271]  It's just that, man, Texas wants leadership, and Texas is under globalist attack, because everybody from Joe Rogan to the Easter Bunny is moving here.
[01:18:05.531 --> 01:18:10.593]  Look at Cenk Uygur, named after a genocidal group, the young Turks that killed a million and a half Armenian Christians.
[01:18:12.884 --> 01:18:13.004]  Wow.
[01:18:32.239 --> 01:18:46.626]  I just showed you where the Department of Energy under Obama and Trump couldn't reverse it, didn't reverse it, shut down over 120 coal power plants and wouldn't let us turn them back on when the governor begged days before the outages to override the federal law.
[01:18:46.887 --> 01:18:54.150]  And only once the power was off did Biden say, yes, now I override it so he could have the cake and eat it too.
[01:18:55.051 --> 01:18:55.491]  Perfect.
[01:18:57.190 --> 01:19:00.018]  Exactly as I would do it if I was a Satanist.
[01:19:00.439 --> 01:19:02.665]  Because I'm not a Satanist, but I can definitely...
[01:19:04.366 --> 01:19:05.266]  Tune into that channel.
[01:19:05.386 --> 01:19:06.467]  That's why they hate me, folks.
[01:19:06.507 --> 01:19:07.107]  I'm not bragging.
[01:19:07.687 --> 01:19:08.868]  I've got the enemy's number, okay?
[01:19:09.568 --> 01:19:10.028]  I've got it.
[01:19:10.468 --> 01:19:10.848]  I've got it.
[01:19:11.049 --> 01:19:12.889]  Listen, my baby, she's got it.
[01:19:13.229 --> 01:19:14.430]  My baby, she's got it.
[01:19:15.150 --> 01:19:17.711]  I'm not trying to brag to the audience because the enemy knows I'm in danger.
[01:19:18.051 --> 01:19:19.112]  I got the enemy's number.
[01:19:19.352 --> 01:19:22.073]  I can dial directly into their channel and hear what they're doing.
[01:19:22.793 --> 01:19:24.634]  That son of a bitch can't dial into anything.
[01:19:24.934 --> 01:19:26.174]  He just grovels to the system.
[01:19:26.575 --> 01:19:27.015]  Shut him down.
[01:19:27.055 --> 01:19:27.615]  I can't look at him.
[01:19:31.596 --> 01:19:32.717]  Oh, don't put him on the screen.
[01:19:32.837 --> 01:19:33.838]  I mean, look at that.
[01:19:34.178 --> 01:19:35.520]  Can you imagine serving Satan?
[01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:37.241]  I mean, this is what we've got.
[01:19:37.261 --> 01:19:44.208]  877-789-2539.
[01:19:44.228 --> 01:19:44.408]  877-789-Alex.
[01:19:44.428 --> 01:19:44.468]  877-789-2539.
[01:19:44.488 --> 01:19:44.648]  877-789-Alex.
[01:19:54.369 --> 01:20:04.223]  From Texans or others that were shut down these power scams, or medical doctors, nurses, others, and if you think COVID's great, it was great for you, I want to hear from you.
[01:20:04.483 --> 01:20:07.807]  God, I'd actually hope like 10 calls in a row, like, I took it and it's great!
[01:20:08.088 --> 01:20:10.892]  I go, maybe I'm crazy, maybe it's okay, but I know I'm not.
[01:20:12.116 --> 01:20:12.936]  It's open phones.
[01:20:13.136 --> 01:20:13.956]  We don't censor you.
[01:20:14.157 --> 01:20:18.197]  Just have a clear phone, your topic, and you're on air to millions.
[01:20:18.418 --> 01:20:19.678]  Millions are tuned in right now.
[01:20:20.238 --> 01:20:20.618]  Millions.
[01:20:20.638 --> 01:20:25.219]  There's probably three million people right now on radio stations and our streams watching.
[01:20:25.279 --> 01:20:26.059]  Three million people!
[01:20:26.299 --> 01:20:29.740]  That's a lot of, that's 30 sports stadiums of 100,000 people.
[01:20:29.820 --> 01:20:30.620]  I'm so blessed.
[01:20:30.901 --> 01:20:32.561]  It's all God, all glory to God.
[01:20:32.861 --> 01:20:35.002]  I'm so blessed to be here, but I want to talk to you.
[01:20:35.022 --> 01:20:35.062]  877-789-2539.
[01:20:42.094 --> 01:20:46.381]  I haven't hit the COVID news that is as big as Donkey Kong's pecker.
[01:20:47.062 --> 01:20:50.767]  And I'm sorry, I'm not a worldly guy, but I just say what I want to say.
[01:20:51.087 --> 01:20:51.268]  Sorry.
[01:20:51.909 --> 01:20:52.369]  It's big.
[01:20:53.110 --> 01:20:53.511]  It's big.
[01:20:54.568 --> 01:21:01.590]  And wait till I hit this because Bill Gates attacked me in Newsweek, AP, Reuters.
[01:21:03.370 --> 01:21:19.294]  I have a Google alert deal and so a day ago I wake up there's like you have 7,000 seriously you have 7,000 messages and I'm like trying to look at on my computer while I'm drinking coffee and it's just like it's all the same article and Bill Gates paid for it.
[01:21:20.942 --> 01:21:23.263]  Bill Gates came out and said, I'm a liar.
[01:21:24.164 --> 01:21:29.347]  Nobody in India banned his vaccine, which he owns and runs, the Pfizer vaccine.
[01:21:30.067 --> 01:21:34.429]  So Paul Watson, I called Paul this morning and I said, please, you're, you're a good writer.
[01:21:34.509 --> 01:21:36.290]  I could write this myself, but will you just write this?
[01:21:36.330 --> 01:21:37.031]  He said, yeah, I'll do it.
[01:21:37.511 --> 01:21:38.652]  So Paul wrote an article about it.
[01:21:38.772 --> 01:21:39.632]  I said, don't put me in it.
[01:21:39.652 --> 01:21:40.313]  Don't make it about me.
[01:21:40.973 --> 01:21:47.256]  It's just an article about, they claim India has not said no to the Pfizer vaccine, which is an admitted fact.
[01:21:47.276 --> 01:21:49.437]  I got a whole stack of articles.
[01:21:49.477 --> 01:21:50.138]  I'll show you coming up.
[01:21:52.193 --> 01:21:53.254]  Can we show the Paul Watson article?
[01:21:53.835 --> 01:21:59.960]  It's Newsweek fact check claims India vaccine ban mostly false while admitting de facto ban.
[01:22:00.300 --> 01:22:08.308]  They said, you're not gonna do the vaccine here, it's untested, it's banned, and they go, well it's banned, but Jones is a liar.
[01:22:11.611 --> 01:22:13.052]  And it's banned in South Africa.
[01:22:14.059 --> 01:22:19.804]  And they've banned the government vaccine in Australia, and Merck pulled out of their vaccine, and all that's true.
[01:22:20.124 --> 01:22:20.945]  And I didn't even know.
[01:22:20.965 --> 01:22:21.785]  I don't pay attention.
[01:22:22.106 --> 01:22:27.350]  I mean, I learned, I guess, three days ago, Rush Limbaugh, Satan, and Alex Jones were the top trends on Twitter.
[01:22:27.910 --> 01:22:29.652]  Like, Rush Limbaugh, Satan, Alex Jones.
[01:22:29.712 --> 01:22:33.155]  Like, Rush Limbaugh's first, then Satan, then I'm like, you know, down here.
[01:22:34.394 --> 01:22:39.777]  Because the left was doing like a joke like, oh you heard me so bad saying I'm Satan, please don't do it anymore.
[01:22:39.797 --> 01:22:42.938]  Like they think, it's all just dumb what they did.
[01:22:43.518 --> 01:22:45.579]  You just sent us massive traffic, you idiots.
[01:22:46.260 --> 01:22:49.141]  But, what am I getting at here?
[01:22:50.081 --> 01:22:50.862]  What am I hitting at here?
[01:22:53.763 --> 01:22:54.303]  They're scared.
[01:22:54.764 --> 01:22:55.884]  And they know the truth is coming out.
[01:22:56.364 --> 01:23:03.528]  And so, they're saying, India didn't ban our vaccine, and the article says, they won't allow it, it is banned, but not the way Alex Jones says.
[01:23:05.097 --> 01:23:07.198]  So that's just another giant enchilada.
[01:23:07.278 --> 01:23:09.780]  And again, we built this infrastructure, you supported it.
[01:23:09.980 --> 01:23:11.801]  So I'm sitting here just thanking God every moment.
[01:23:11.821 --> 01:23:15.102]  Because I'm like, my post firing the can like, the enemy.
[01:23:15.303 --> 01:23:16.883]  Like it's a video game, but it's real.
[01:23:17.304 --> 01:23:18.905]  I'm just like, thank you, God, I'm still in the game.
[01:23:18.925 --> 01:23:20.125]  Because I can't believe this.
[01:23:20.445 --> 01:23:22.807]  And like, do you realize how weak they are?
[01:23:22.927 --> 01:23:23.847]  I'm not that powerful.
[01:23:24.468 --> 01:23:26.109]  I call out that India banned it.
[01:23:26.209 --> 01:23:27.249]  No one else was doing it.
[01:23:27.489 --> 01:23:28.590]  It goes totally viral.
[01:23:30.911 --> 01:23:32.092]  I mean, that's a big deal.
[01:23:34.206 --> 01:23:35.387]  But you know, it was you.
[01:23:36.608 --> 01:23:41.111]  You understood it was important, you got it out, so it had a gigantic effect.
[01:23:43.032 --> 01:23:48.276]  And now Bill Gates has got crap running down the inside of his leg, which is exactly what I want him to have going on.
[01:23:50.731 --> 01:23:53.713]  I feel God getting closer to me as Bill Gates hates me.
[01:23:54.173 --> 01:23:55.294]  See, it's all about God fear.
[01:23:55.674 --> 01:23:57.595]  Not fear of God, fear of God leaving.
[01:23:57.955 --> 01:24:00.957]  Fear of God is, no, no, no, no, no, I need you.
[01:24:00.977 --> 01:24:02.658]  Like a fire going away in the cold.
[01:24:03.198 --> 01:24:04.519]  Oh, oh, oh, come around.
[01:24:04.779 --> 01:24:06.560]  Like the more danger I'm in, the closer I'm to God.
[01:24:06.580 --> 01:24:07.641]  It's like, oh, this is good.
[01:24:07.961 --> 01:24:09.221]  The enemy's like, why are you not scared?
[01:24:09.482 --> 01:24:10.762]  God's getting real close now.
[01:24:10.782 --> 01:24:12.143]  Oh, he's getting so close.
[01:24:12.443 --> 01:24:17.226]  Oh, I can imagine right when they take that gun to my head and say, denounce Christ, I'll be like, pull that trigger, bitch.
[01:24:17.326 --> 01:24:18.006]  I'm with Jesus.
[01:24:22.022 --> 01:24:22.902]  Yes, my friends.
[01:24:24.263 --> 01:24:25.924]  Everything we talk about is epic.
[01:24:27.164 --> 01:24:30.346]  Because just as there is the false in the universe, there is the real.
[01:24:31.086 --> 01:24:37.730]  There he is, plugging your soul directly into the zeitgeist and eternity and taking it on!
[01:24:38.270 --> 01:24:39.611]  Are you ready?
[01:24:45.073 --> 01:24:45.834]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:24:53.891 --> 01:24:55.072]  All right, let's go to your phone calls.
[01:24:55.532 --> 01:25:06.481]  Brandon, Brad, Taylor, Carlos, Paul, Logan, John, Trent, we're taking your calls on the power shutdown and the smoking gun document.
[01:25:06.741 --> 01:25:09.523]  The Department of Energy ordered Texas to stay stood down.
[01:25:09.563 --> 01:25:10.664]  We have the document.
[01:25:11.065 --> 01:25:12.185]  Burn in hell, globalists.
[01:25:12.205 --> 01:25:13.386]  We have your ass now.
[01:25:13.707 --> 01:25:16.669]  You will pay and not destroy the rest of the country because we're the test.
[01:25:16.709 --> 01:25:20.132]  They can take us down as Texas goes, goes the rest of the nation.
[01:25:21.408 --> 01:25:27.271]  And then, of course, we've got medical workers calling in with your stories about the COVID vaccine.
[01:25:27.291 --> 01:25:27.891]  Do you love it?
[01:25:28.211 --> 01:25:28.811]  Do you hate it?
[01:25:29.271 --> 01:25:30.092]  We're not censoring you.
[01:25:30.132 --> 01:25:32.873]  We don't want to hear from you.
[01:25:32.893 --> 01:25:33.333]  877-789-2539.
[01:25:34.033 --> 01:25:35.894]  Carlos in the great state of Texas.
[01:25:35.914 --> 01:25:36.534]  Thanks for calling.
[01:25:36.574 --> 01:25:36.915]  Go ahead.
[01:25:36.935 --> 01:25:40.996]  Hey, Alex.
[01:25:41.016 --> 01:25:41.777]  How are you doing?
[01:25:41.997 --> 01:25:42.457]  Good, brother.
[01:25:42.497 --> 01:25:43.377]  Thank you for calling in.
[01:25:43.417 --> 01:25:44.398]  What is your view on this?
[01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:53.566]  Well, they are continuing their extermination program by continuing to target the less fortunate.
[01:25:53.926 --> 01:25:58.170]  I'm very fortunate to make an alright sum of money.
[01:25:58.210 --> 01:26:02.873]  I could go out and get a generator for whatever I need, but there's a lot of people who are not as fortunate.
[01:26:03.294 --> 01:26:05.976]  I think the death toll is up to about 37 people now.
[01:26:08.598 --> 01:26:12.661]  I can only imagine that out of those 37, it was those less fortunate, those
[01:26:13.408 --> 01:26:15.229]  Elderly people, they can't get out of their house.
[01:26:15.329 --> 01:26:18.591]  It's going to be in the hundreds and it's a beta test to train us.
[01:26:18.631 --> 01:26:19.011]  You're right.
[01:26:20.051 --> 01:26:20.512]  Yes, sir.
[01:26:21.232 --> 01:26:32.838]  Now that, linked together with that executive order, we need a new powerful voice to replace Russia's voice.
[01:26:32.918 --> 01:26:38.861]  Now, I don't know who that's going to be, but I think we all know who it's going to be.
[01:26:40.239 --> 01:26:47.525]  We need to let all the Patriots need to link up and we need to choose and I don't think there's any more obvious choice than you Alex.
[01:26:48.526 --> 01:27:00.817]  Well here's the deal we already online we're bigger than Rush and then they censored us and Rush is great we love Rush I don't want to be the quote guy his show will be turned over to whoever that company wants to have it done but I agree with you that
[01:27:01.835 --> 01:27:08.482]  Listeners of Rush should migrate wherever they want and decide what show they want to lead the fight against the globalists.
[01:27:08.502 --> 01:27:10.944]  But getting back to this, how big a deal is it to you?
[01:27:10.964 --> 01:27:12.706]  Because again, I was really mad at myself today.
[01:27:12.726 --> 01:27:13.407]  That's why I blew up.
[01:27:13.427 --> 01:27:15.589]  I had family call me and go, hey, you know, there's a federal agreement.
[01:27:15.929 --> 01:27:17.111]  We can't turn these plants up.
[01:27:17.771 --> 01:27:20.594]  Well, you know, hearing it and knowing that this was happening since last week,
[01:27:43.452 --> 01:27:51.837]  And getting no mainstream coverage, Abbott not talking about it, it really pisses me off.
[01:27:52.698 --> 01:27:53.998]  It angers me.
[01:27:54.018 --> 01:28:00.042]  Mind you, like I said, I do very good at work, thankfully, for now.
[01:28:01.804 --> 01:28:05.286]  While there's still my type of work, I work in the oil and gas industry.
[01:28:06.161 --> 01:28:13.187]  And for now, this is probably the last good year it's going to be, and then everybody's going to have to migrate to their renewable sources.
[01:28:14.208 --> 01:28:14.508]  You know?
[01:28:14.528 --> 01:28:18.751]  And at this point... Which, by the way, are unsustainable.
[01:28:19.172 --> 01:28:19.772]  Unsustainable.
[01:28:20.653 --> 01:28:21.013]  Correct.
[01:28:22.154 --> 01:28:27.879]  Unsustainable renewable sources that froze up during this whole ordeal.
[01:28:28.459 --> 01:28:31.321]  They're blaming it on the gas pipelines that froze up.
[01:28:31.361 --> 01:28:35.345]  Well, that's what happens when you shut down the freaking plant and don't allow the freaking gas.
[01:28:36.269 --> 01:28:38.390]  There's nothing better than trainloads of coal.
[01:28:38.510 --> 01:28:39.530]  Coal is king.
[01:28:39.850 --> 01:28:41.411]  Alright, God bless you brother, absolutely.
[01:28:41.791 --> 01:28:45.512]  This is the real world folks and they want you to think Texas is dumb is why this happened.
[01:28:45.772 --> 01:28:46.592]  This was done to you.
[01:28:48.492 --> 01:28:49.993]  Alright, I'm taking your phone calls.
[01:28:50.013 --> 01:28:54.154]  I don't think I need to recap the incredibly epic news we just covered.
[01:28:55.534 --> 01:28:57.015]  But man, it's bone shattering.
[01:28:58.618 --> 01:29:08.323]  To know that they cut the power off on purpose and the federal government is in control of Texas and the whole media is gaslighting us to say that we're to blame so they can do it to your state next.
[01:29:10.424 --> 01:29:20.829]  And Communist China, I have an article, I'll cover it later, is bragging that America is pathetic and that Joe Biden says their death camps are okay and saying you can't even provide power for your people.
[01:29:21.943 --> 01:29:23.084]  That's how they demoralize you.
[01:29:23.104 --> 01:29:24.084]  That's how they shut you down.
[01:29:24.104 --> 01:29:29.867]  And they have a dictator in that stole the election, so they just are going to go full bore, folks.
[01:29:31.187 --> 01:29:33.848]  They have articles that Biden goes to sleep at 7 o'clock at night.
[01:29:35.469 --> 01:29:36.469]  It's a CNN headline.
[01:29:36.730 --> 01:29:39.191]  Oh, early nights and fires at the White House.
[01:29:41.031 --> 01:29:44.253]  We're taking your phone calls on the power plants being shut down.
[01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:48.721]  Every caller is about the Department of Energy.
[01:29:48.741 --> 01:29:54.324]  I hope the phone's up on medical workers about the vaccines, but everybody's calling about the power plants.
[01:29:54.404 --> 01:29:55.084]  Let's just do that.
[01:29:55.464 --> 01:29:57.265]  Let's go on the order that they were received.
[01:29:57.645 --> 01:30:00.387]  Brad in Illinois, power plants outages in Texas.
[01:30:00.407 --> 01:30:01.087]  What's your take on it?
[01:30:01.967 --> 01:30:02.948]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[01:30:03.448 --> 01:30:03.948]  Good, brother.
[01:30:04.008 --> 01:30:08.570]  Yeah, I was just doing some research on Illinois' reactors up here in Illinois.
[01:30:08.611 --> 01:30:11.672]  We've got 11 reactors and six plants.
[01:30:12.532 --> 01:30:15.394]  That kind of seems like a planned
[01:30:16.704 --> 01:30:22.586]  You know, distribution of energy up in Illinois, but looks like you guys don't get it down there in Texas anymore, right?
[01:30:24.007 --> 01:30:30.489]  Well, what they did is they just, they wouldn't let under federal regulations, the coal plants turn up their capacity.
[01:30:30.889 --> 01:30:31.750]  So they did it by design.
[01:30:32.970 --> 01:30:33.210]  Right.
[01:30:33.350 --> 01:30:42.774]  I also noticed through the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that you had scheduled two plants to be, they've been planned, but they haven't been built.
[01:30:42.914 --> 01:30:45.855]  And they just keep pushing back the timeline on that.
[01:30:46.841 --> 01:30:52.884]  They don't want to give you that contract to go ahead and go forward with it and build it.
[01:30:53.445 --> 01:30:53.885]  That's right.
[01:30:53.925 --> 01:31:00.069]  Even though nuclear doesn't create any carbon, the establishment doesn't want that because the goal is to shut US power off.
[01:31:01.249 --> 01:31:01.449]  Right.
[01:31:02.330 --> 01:31:08.813]  So we used to be at the forefront of building all this technology and having all these power systems.
[01:31:09.494 --> 01:31:12.956]  Why, by design, are we being shut down incrementally over time?
[01:31:13.889 --> 01:31:20.152]  Because the globalists have invested in China and India and other countries, so if they shut down our investment, it guarantees their investment.
[01:31:20.712 --> 01:31:23.854]  So, money we lose is money the globalists make.
[01:31:23.874 --> 01:31:24.494]  Does that make sense?
[01:31:25.355 --> 01:31:26.935]  Yeah, so it's just like Mammon, right?
[01:31:27.035 --> 01:31:32.538]  Everybody's greedy, and at the end of the day, they're just going to step over the bodies and watch everybody die, right?
[01:31:32.958 --> 01:31:36.040]  Well, that's what feudalism that every government in the past ran was.
[01:31:36.500 --> 01:31:37.900]  Make your general public poor.
[01:31:37.941 --> 01:31:41.042]  They're so busy trying to not starve to death, they won't get too uppity.
[01:31:41.382 --> 01:31:41.922]  God bless you.
[01:31:41.942 --> 01:31:42.803]  I appreciate your call.
[01:31:43.942 --> 01:31:45.422]  All right, we're moving quick through these calls.
[01:31:45.823 --> 01:31:49.403]  Taylor in California, rolling blackouts during the crisis.
[01:31:49.764 --> 01:31:50.764]  The model is Enron.
[01:31:50.784 --> 01:31:52.244]  They did it in California by design.
[01:31:52.704 --> 01:31:55.405]  Once they do blackouts, they learn you will agree to pay more money.
[01:31:55.725 --> 01:31:57.306]  Give us your take on the situation, Taylor.
[01:31:58.426 --> 01:31:58.866]  Hey, Alex.
[01:31:58.906 --> 01:32:00.206]  You know, it's the breathwork guy.
[01:32:00.286 --> 01:32:02.807]  My property's in California, and you know, it's in the mountains.
[01:32:03.167 --> 01:32:06.168]  It's Trump country, like much of California in reality, but...
[01:32:07.084 --> 01:32:12.427]  During the 2020 wildfires, or arsons rather, we had the rolling blackouts.
[01:32:12.467 --> 01:32:15.549]  They were constant and they were always like in patches like 10 a.m.
[01:32:16.149 --> 01:32:16.749]  to 2 p.m.
[01:32:17.309 --> 01:32:23.092]  and honestly if I didn't have panels and generators, I would have been screwed so many times.
[01:32:23.112 --> 01:32:25.233]  Like there's no way that I can trust the government.
[01:32:25.273 --> 01:32:30.076]  I don't know if getting rid of Newsom is going to change anything, but at this point everything is just completely rogue.
[01:32:32.023 --> 01:32:38.628]  I agree with you, and you know, they have this philosophy, I have the article here, I forget the exact term, where they charge you according to the time.
[01:32:38.668 --> 01:32:44.452]  They train you that, oh, there's not enough power, we're going to charge you more, and depending on what time you use it, we're going to charge you more.
[01:32:45.393 --> 01:32:47.134]  Yeah, and then they have different tiers as well.
[01:32:47.315 --> 01:32:53.779]  So it's different times, and then everybody, based on their income, is in different tiers, and your location, and it's such a scale.
[01:32:53.840 --> 01:32:55.601]  I don't know how there's any oversight over it.
[01:32:56.221 --> 01:32:57.442]  It's so corrupt at this point.
[01:32:57.482 --> 01:32:59.604]  It's totally a parasitic environment.
[01:33:01.854 --> 01:33:05.178]  Yeah, there's time of use systems, what it's called, and that's what they're putting us under.
[01:33:05.398 --> 01:33:07.681]  Oh, the crisis, we need to control your thermostat.
[01:33:07.721 --> 01:33:10.384]  Oh, we need to... Meanwhile, did you see the smoking gun document?
[01:33:10.685 --> 01:33:21.318]  The Department of Energy wouldn't let Texas up its power until the grid already crashed Saturday night, and then said you got to buy it from outside power sources at 18,000 times what it previously cost.
[01:33:22.631 --> 01:33:26.012]  I mean, it just sounds like the total globalist leftist agenda.
[01:33:26.052 --> 01:33:31.334]  It's the same thing in California with the, you know, our gas is a dollar more than the rest of the country.
[01:33:31.374 --> 01:33:38.996]  As far as energy goes, the whole thing is parasitic and them trying to leech energy from our spiritual energy to our physical energy to our dollar.
[01:33:39.516 --> 01:33:44.878]  Again, our dollar is basically solidified breath, or we're exchanging our breath of life for money.
[01:33:45.618 --> 01:33:46.378]  No, that's it, Taylor.
[01:33:46.398 --> 01:33:47.039]  You said it again.
[01:33:47.079 --> 01:33:48.559]  They are literally vampires.
[01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:52.882]  Imagine, like a vampire, like, hey, vampire, why don't you grow some tomatoes?
[01:33:52.902 --> 01:33:54.042]  Or why don't you grow some apples?
[01:33:54.102 --> 01:33:55.443]  Or why don't you grow some squash?
[01:33:55.483 --> 01:33:57.564]  Or, you know, why don't you grow some rutabaga?
[01:33:57.584 --> 01:33:59.165]  Or why don't you grow some corn?
[01:33:59.585 --> 01:34:01.606]  Vampire's like, I drink blood of kids.
[01:34:02.266 --> 01:34:03.647]  It's like they steal stuff.
[01:34:04.067 --> 01:34:05.088]  All right, thanks for the call, Taylor.
[01:34:05.108 --> 01:34:05.668]  Good to hear from you.
[01:34:06.028 --> 01:34:07.068]  All right, we're going to move quick here.
[01:34:07.128 --> 01:34:07.589]  Moving fast.
[01:34:07.649 --> 01:34:09.850]  Josh in Texas, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:34:11.383 --> 01:34:13.304]  Alex, God bless you and the entire crew.
[01:34:13.404 --> 01:34:15.704]  I'm living here, down here in Houston, Texas.
[01:34:15.724 --> 01:34:20.605]  Been through one of the most challenging weeks of my life with my three kids.
[01:34:20.645 --> 01:34:25.207]  I live close to the Memorial City Mall, right in the Houston suburbs, right in the thick of this whole thing.
[01:34:25.227 --> 01:34:34.169]  And I can just want to say thank you to you guys, because there is not a chance I would have gotten through this with myself, my wife, my three kids, without two things.
[01:34:34.569 --> 01:34:37.010]  First thing, the water filtration system is incredible.
[01:34:37.110 --> 01:34:38.370]  Anybody listening, please
[01:34:38.837 --> 01:34:39.897]  Please get prepared.
[01:34:39.957 --> 01:34:44.758]  You do not want to be a victim to this government, to this squeeze.
[01:34:45.599 --> 01:35:00.062]  Thank InfoWars and Alex and this entire crew because every day you guys get uncomfortable and you have the uncomfortable conversation and you teach us here on the ground to be uncomfortable and to talk to people and to have the uncomfortable conversation.
[01:35:00.487 --> 01:35:04.369]  And the reason why I love you so much, Alex, is because you're real.
[01:35:04.609 --> 01:35:05.829]  You say when you make mistakes.
[01:35:06.169 --> 01:35:08.791]  You say when something got by you, when the Q thing.
[01:35:09.551 --> 01:35:12.672]  You're just a real InfoWars, as real as it gets in America.
[01:35:12.952 --> 01:35:18.915]  And I can tell you from listening to you guys from my generator power this week, you kept my connection to humans.
[01:35:18.995 --> 01:35:20.736]  You kept my connection to God, Alex.
[01:35:20.796 --> 01:35:21.456]  And I'm telling you,
[01:35:21.977 --> 01:35:34.781]  I have been freezing my butt off, me and my family, in 40 degree weather all week long, but I can promise you, every morning when I wake up, I was going to Bandot Video, waiting for your reports, because you guys keep our connection to God, and our human connection.
[01:35:34.821 --> 01:35:35.841]  Well, brother, that's so beautiful.
[01:35:35.861 --> 01:35:39.002]  That's exactly what John, John the Boom operator said.
[01:35:39.322 --> 01:35:40.822]  Doesn't matter, Jones, you blew up earlier.
[01:35:40.862 --> 01:35:41.182]  That's real.
[01:35:41.202 --> 01:35:42.243]  They're looking for red blood.
[01:35:42.523 --> 01:35:43.063]  And that's it.
[01:35:43.423 --> 01:35:44.783]  All I've got is I'm real.
[01:35:44.863 --> 01:35:48.184]  That's my only thing, is that I'm not fake like these other people.
[01:35:48.204 --> 01:35:49.145]  And you're not fake either.
[01:35:49.165 --> 01:35:50.665]  And I knew this was coming.
[01:35:50.925 --> 01:35:51.946]  They do this everywhere else.
[01:35:51.966 --> 01:35:52.986]  They turn the power off.
[01:35:53.006 --> 01:35:53.827]  They rip everybody off.
[01:35:53.867 --> 01:35:55.328]  They want to bankrupt the economy.
[01:35:55.588 --> 01:35:58.650]  They call it the IMF riot, where they start doing rolling blackouts.
[01:35:58.910 --> 01:36:00.251]  They kill the currency.
[01:36:00.551 --> 01:36:03.473]  They did it all over Latin America, all over Africa, all over Asia.
[01:36:03.754 --> 01:36:10.658]  And what the globalists did, Greg Powell's got this 20 years ago, BBC reported at the time, what they did to the third world, they're going to do to us.
[01:36:10.798 --> 01:36:11.839]  And now it's here, brother.
[01:36:12.139 --> 01:36:14.981]  And so I just know we're going to end up defeating them in the end.
[01:36:15.141 --> 01:36:16.882]  It doesn't matter how much media control they've got.
[01:36:16.902 --> 01:36:18.484]  I think they've bit off more than they can chew.
[01:36:18.504 --> 01:36:18.904]  What do you think?
[01:36:20.380 --> 01:36:23.161]  I 100% agree with you Alex and everyday listeners.
[01:36:23.281 --> 01:36:25.722]  You've been preparing us for this every day.
[01:36:25.762 --> 01:36:27.243]  You and Infowars and that great crew.
[01:36:27.543 --> 01:36:28.663]  You guys work your butt off.
[01:36:28.683 --> 01:36:30.064]  You come in there every day.
[01:36:30.404 --> 01:36:31.204]  Get uncomfortable.
[01:36:31.484 --> 01:36:32.645]  You're baited to sacrifice.
[01:36:32.825 --> 01:36:34.426]  You guys are the tip of the spear.
[01:36:34.446 --> 01:36:38.027]  There is nobody else on this planet that does what you guys do.
[01:36:38.327 --> 01:36:40.728]  And I'm telling you, please Alex, don't give up.
[01:36:40.768 --> 01:36:42.289]  I know you won't give up because I hear it in your voice.
[01:36:42.309 --> 01:36:43.169]  No, I'm not going to give up.
[01:36:43.309 --> 01:36:45.710]  I get so angry though that it's just, you know.
[01:36:46.715 --> 01:36:50.057]  You get beat up so bad and you continue to grind and your crew every day.
[01:36:50.177 --> 01:36:51.818]  Thank God for you guys.
[01:36:51.898 --> 01:36:53.039]  No, thank God for you, brother.
[01:36:53.379 --> 01:36:59.603]  What do you make of the Smoking Gun Department of Energy document admitting that they ordered Texas not to increase power?
[01:37:00.524 --> 01:37:03.606]  I am sitting in my car, I have 50 printouts of that document.
[01:37:03.866 --> 01:37:11.149]  I am sitting in my car, I am passing it out to everybody that I see saying, here is the real information, right from the U.S.
[01:37:11.430 --> 01:37:12.330]  government website.
[01:37:12.670 --> 01:37:13.030]  Read it.
[01:37:13.431 --> 01:37:13.791]  Know it.
[01:37:14.071 --> 01:37:16.072]  Pass out the articles, people that are listening.
[01:37:16.152 --> 01:37:16.652]  Print them out.
[01:37:16.732 --> 01:37:17.292]  Pass them out.
[01:37:17.633 --> 01:37:20.014]  Tell these people in America that they don't care about us.
[01:37:20.434 --> 01:37:21.875]  That these elites don't care.
[01:37:22.175 --> 01:37:24.136]  I tell people all the time, you think they care about you.
[01:37:24.156 --> 01:37:25.337]  You think Fauci burks.
[01:37:25.677 --> 01:37:27.157]  You think these people care about you.
[01:37:27.458 --> 01:37:30.119]  You're more peasant to them, more scum to them.
[01:37:30.859 --> 01:37:34.141]  Oh, the carbon comes first, you know, not humans.
[01:37:34.481 --> 01:37:38.724]  It's all their excuse to starve us and make $10,000, $18,000 percent more profit.
[01:37:38.984 --> 01:37:40.124]  Thank you so much, Josh.
[01:37:40.705 --> 01:37:41.825]  All right, more callers.
[01:37:41.905 --> 01:37:45.087]  Straight ahead on the other side, the order they are received.
[01:37:45.707 --> 01:37:47.128]  So many calls straight ahead.
[01:37:47.208 --> 01:37:54.192]  Travis, Emily, Jay, CD, Logan, Tom, Jody, Chantel, Trent, Matt, your calls are straight ahead.
[01:37:54.392 --> 01:37:56.654]  InfoWars.com.
[01:37:56.714 --> 01:37:57.174]  Stay with us.
[01:37:59.534 --> 01:38:01.735]  You know what God says, time's on my side.
[01:38:04.317 --> 01:38:09.560]  Arlo Sham in a bunch of phone calls ahead of Joe Skousen and Max Keiser popping in next hour.
[01:38:09.580 --> 01:38:13.643]  Who's been home the longest here?
[01:38:13.663 --> 01:38:16.905]  That would be Travis in the great state of Texas.
[01:38:17.625 --> 01:38:20.547]  Then again, if Texas was to blame for the power outage, I'd say Texas was to blame.
[01:38:20.567 --> 01:38:21.388]  Screw these politicians.
[01:38:22.321 --> 01:38:23.902]  No, I have the executive orders.
[01:38:23.962 --> 01:38:25.403]  I have the Department of Energy documents.
[01:38:25.423 --> 01:38:27.124]  I already showed them 50 times the last few hours.
[01:38:28.045 --> 01:38:33.108]  They ordered Texas not to produce more power and said buy it from outside states at 18,000 times.
[01:38:33.128 --> 01:38:33.648]  Reuters said 10,000.
[01:38:33.688 --> 01:38:35.329]  We looked at the numbers.
[01:38:35.449 --> 01:38:39.792]  It's 18,000 times some of the stuff was purchased, just like Enron running scams on California.
[01:38:39.812 --> 01:38:41.013]  So an amazing point.
[01:38:41.073 --> 01:38:42.073]  Travis, go ahead, my friend.
[01:38:43.694 --> 01:38:44.575]  Hey, Alex, how you doing?
[01:38:44.595 --> 01:38:46.056]  I'm from Besoria County down here.
[01:38:47.397 --> 01:38:48.277]  Well, God bless you, brother.
[01:38:48.297 --> 01:38:48.938]  What do you make of this?
[01:38:49.986 --> 01:38:52.929]  Man, I think it's just crazy as hell, honestly.
[01:38:53.650 --> 01:38:57.594]  I can't really say any other words, but I'll tell you what.
[01:39:00.117 --> 01:39:04.502]  If Texas were tired of the federal government, you can bet their ass that they are now.
[01:39:05.943 --> 01:39:06.504]  Exactly.
[01:39:06.524 --> 01:39:09.868]  If they thought this would make Texas run to the feds, this is the opposite.
[01:39:10.731 --> 01:39:14.232]  Dude, if I'm part of the Texas Nationalist Movement, I'm talking to everybody down here.
[01:39:14.652 --> 01:39:15.633]  People are fed up.
[01:39:15.813 --> 01:39:17.453]  It don't matter, boo.
[01:39:17.713 --> 01:39:22.795]  Well, what are they going to do when they learn that the feds cut the power and wouldn't let Texas turn the power on?
[01:39:23.095 --> 01:39:25.135]  My question is, Texas needs to stop following these orders.
[01:39:26.356 --> 01:39:27.056]  Well, exactly.
[01:39:27.156 --> 01:39:27.816]  I totally agree.
[01:39:28.276 --> 01:39:28.777]  And you know what?
[01:39:28.797 --> 01:39:29.677]  You're asking the question.
[01:39:30.399 --> 01:39:32.941]  Texans are going to say yes to Texas even more!
[01:39:33.922 --> 01:39:35.643]  Texans are not cowards.
[01:39:36.003 --> 01:39:37.064]  We do not back down.
[01:39:37.345 --> 01:39:41.288]  You think that Bill Graham said F you, that's what we say F you to do.
[01:39:42.128 --> 01:39:48.974]  So you're saying when Joe Biden says it's your fault you're not buying it, especially you have the Department of Energy document that he ordered the powers to be kept off.
[01:39:50.195 --> 01:39:54.278]  Exactly, and you know what Alex, I just spoke to my State Rep.
[01:39:54.438 --> 01:39:56.780]  District Director here in Missouri County,
[01:39:57.492 --> 01:40:01.022]  And she was calling it off when I told her of the documentation that she put on air.
[01:40:01.042 --> 01:40:02.627]  She's like, oh my word!
[01:40:06.164 --> 01:40:07.024]  It says it all there.
[01:40:07.064 --> 01:40:13.948]  We have links to all the wholesale documents where we're only allowed to buy it from outside the state when they have the coal power plants fired up and ready to go.
[01:40:14.008 --> 01:40:14.608]  God bless you.
[01:40:15.009 --> 01:40:15.669]  Keep spreading it.
[01:40:15.909 --> 01:40:17.710]  Don Salazar wrote an article about it, I'm told.
[01:40:18.090 --> 01:40:19.851]  Let's show the Infowars.com article.
[01:40:20.231 --> 01:40:21.752]  We have the live show feed of this.
[01:40:21.832 --> 01:40:25.534]  Folks, you've got to get this out to everybody you know in Texas if you want to stop these people.
[01:40:26.234 --> 01:40:27.055]  This is so key.
[01:40:27.075 --> 01:40:29.676]  Let's take another call here.
[01:40:29.716 --> 01:40:32.257]  Let's go ahead and talk to Emily in Florida.
[01:40:32.297 --> 01:40:33.138]  Emily, thanks for holding.
[01:40:33.158 --> 01:40:35.159]  You want to talk about private corporations and power outages?
[01:40:35.199 --> 01:40:35.479]  Go ahead.
[01:40:36.829 --> 01:40:40.815]  Hi Alex, I'm really sorry first for what you're going through there in Texas.
[01:40:41.515 --> 01:40:49.767]  I'm originally from a really cold northeast state of Maine, so I understand how brutal it can be, especially if you can't handle it.
[01:40:50.327 --> 01:40:52.390]  Oh wow, Maine's even colder than Minnesota, yeah.
[01:40:54.688 --> 01:40:58.930]  And second of all, I just wanted to talk about, like, the corporations have been doing this for a very long time.
[01:40:59.910 --> 01:41:02.952]  I know from my experiences up in Maine, it started with Poland Springs.
[01:41:03.872 --> 01:41:11.476]  Nestle bought Poland Springs, which was a wonderful company that bottled water and was very environmental and took care of, like, you know, local issues.
[01:41:11.596 --> 01:41:16.318]  And Nestle came in and bought them out, and they've been stripping Maine of water ever since.
[01:41:16.398 --> 01:41:18.239]  They've now since moved down to Florida.
[01:41:18.259 --> 01:41:21.140]  They're attacking some central state
[01:41:21.824 --> 01:41:24.726]  You're right.
[01:41:24.766 --> 01:41:33.433]  I was actually involved in a national TV program, True TV, on what happened up in the Great Lakes.
[01:41:33.473 --> 01:41:36.715]  You're exactly right about those big companies coming in and just stealing all the water.
[01:41:37.476 --> 01:41:43.921]  But then they won't let locals have a well, but then the big companies just take all the water and fill up oil tankers to send it back to China.
[01:41:46.610 --> 01:41:47.972]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:41:48.032 --> 01:41:50.995]  It's being exported, not imported a lot of times.
[01:41:51.735 --> 01:41:54.598]  And the number one thing I wanted to say is that we never fought it.
[01:41:54.779 --> 01:41:56.520]  We never fought it when it was these corporations.
[01:41:56.580 --> 01:41:59.904]  And of course the government's going to see that and say, hold on a second, we want in on that.
[01:41:59.924 --> 01:42:02.607]  I mean, it's just not surprising.
[01:42:05.242 --> 01:42:10.145]  I agree with you, but I mean, I knew that the Feds were in control of our energy, and I knew they shut down over 100 plants.
[01:42:10.546 --> 01:42:19.691]  I knew the windmills failed, but I kind of got distracted by the windmills, so I got called by sources, and they said, no Alex, the Feds won't let us turn up the power plants, which is true.
[01:42:20.032 --> 01:42:21.713]  And then we found the Department of Energy document.
[01:42:22.073 --> 01:42:28.317]  That just made me so mad that they would publicly do this, like we're too dumb to figure it out, but they're so reliant
[01:42:30.217 --> 01:42:38.720]  I mean, it's insane.
[01:42:39.260 --> 01:42:46.321]  I'm lucky enough that, I don't know how I had the foresight, but I'm down in Florida now, and we have an incredible governor.
[01:42:46.902 --> 01:42:49.602]  DeSantis is just a champion for us here.
[01:42:49.622 --> 01:42:52.083]  I'll say it, he's even better than Trump.
[01:42:53.041 --> 01:42:54.421]  He's absolutely incredible.
[01:42:54.661 --> 01:42:57.082]  He's absolutely incredible.
[01:42:57.402 --> 01:43:08.565]  I wanted to talk, too, about how it's interesting that the two states that were kind of fighting the agenda were obviously Texas when they started talking about a Texas movement, and also Florida.
[01:43:08.765 --> 01:43:13.947]  And now Biden wants to do internal checkpoints and not let flights fly to Florida.
[01:43:13.987 --> 01:43:14.367]  Exactly.
[01:43:15.163 --> 01:43:15.883]  Exactly.
[01:43:15.923 --> 01:43:20.146]  So there's definitely an attack going on, a counterattack and a counterpunch.
[01:43:20.826 --> 01:43:21.707]  And it's pretty obvious.
[01:43:21.727 --> 01:43:23.508]  So the question is, how are they going to hit Florida?
[01:43:23.568 --> 01:43:28.230]  I think DeSantis had it in a moment in the past saying, how dare you, we have lower COVID cases, lock us down.
[01:43:28.551 --> 01:43:32.313]  But I mean, how do you think Biden's going to, the CHICOMS are going to try to hit Florida?
[01:43:33.313 --> 01:43:38.376]  I mean, I really hope that DeSantis is too smart and he's ahead of the game.
[01:43:38.656 --> 01:43:39.777]  I mean, he's really been
[01:43:40.731 --> 01:43:42.732]  Ahead of the game as far as I can see.
[01:43:43.032 --> 01:43:43.732]  No one else.
[01:43:44.313 --> 01:43:45.493]  No one else.
[01:43:45.513 --> 01:43:49.795]  Well part of that is people used to be kind of punch drunk and trusting the system.
[01:43:49.835 --> 01:43:51.656]  Now Trump's ahead of the game now.
[01:43:51.676 --> 01:43:52.957]  Now he's out of office I can tell you.
[01:43:52.997 --> 01:43:53.717]  People will talk to him.
[01:43:54.337 --> 01:43:56.839]  And the sadness is because now they know how bad it is.
[01:43:56.919 --> 01:43:58.459]  I want Ted Cruz to get ahead of the game.
[01:43:58.819 --> 01:44:00.140]  I want Rand Paul to get ahead of the game.
[01:44:00.160 --> 01:44:01.681]  Which means be hardcore.
[01:44:01.721 --> 01:44:02.641]  Beautiful call Emily.
[01:44:02.681 --> 01:44:03.382]  Thank you so much.
[01:44:03.862 --> 01:44:05.182]  Alright next in order.
[01:44:05.903 --> 01:44:07.043]  Who is next in order?
[01:44:07.083 --> 01:44:08.244]  Who's been holding the longest here?
[01:44:09.468 --> 01:44:10.568]  That would be Tom.
[01:44:12.089 --> 01:44:14.870]  Tom in Chicago, and then Jay, and then CD.
[01:44:15.190 --> 01:44:16.210]  Tom, thanks for holding.
[01:44:16.230 --> 01:44:16.530]  Go ahead.
[01:44:16.550 --> 01:44:18.831]  Hey, what's going on, Alex?
[01:44:18.851 --> 01:44:19.351]  How you doing?
[01:44:19.431 --> 01:44:30.234]  Man, I'm just, I mean, I've got smoking gun that the state of Texas was ordered by the feds to not turn coal power plants on and to buy foreign power outside of the state that bankrupted people.
[01:44:30.254 --> 01:44:30.935]  It's incredible.
[01:44:31.315 --> 01:44:32.555]  They've gone from $50 a megawatt to $9,000.
[01:44:36.829 --> 01:44:38.570]  Yeah, it's pretty insane going on out there.
[01:44:38.730 --> 01:44:41.012]  You know, prayers to you guys from Chicago.
[01:44:42.493 --> 01:44:43.993]  Strange times, my man, strange times.
[01:44:44.194 --> 01:44:52.679]  But, you know, the reason I'm calling was actually a little bit off topic for what's, you know, even going on or, you know, what you've been talking about today.
[01:44:52.719 --> 01:44:54.060]  But anyways, what I wanted to say was,
[01:44:55.287 --> 01:45:01.670]  You know, I searched on the search bar the other day, global population at the end of 2020 compared to the end of 2019.
[01:45:02.090 --> 01:45:05.251]  Our population has actually gone up since this pandemic has began.
[01:45:06.392 --> 01:45:07.292]  Yes, the U.S.
[01:45:07.332 --> 01:45:08.192]  population went up.
[01:45:08.212 --> 01:45:09.813]  We had roughly the same number of deaths in 2020.
[01:45:09.853 --> 01:45:10.273]  2019, it's a hoax.
[01:45:10.333 --> 01:45:10.813]  Yes, sir.
[01:45:13.143 --> 01:45:16.586]  It's a total hoax, and I don't know why mainstream media is not talking about that.
[01:45:16.666 --> 01:45:20.169]  I even hired a private actuary statistician.
[01:45:20.209 --> 01:45:20.989]  We did it months ago.
[01:45:21.049 --> 01:45:21.950]  Nobody cared, but yeah.
[01:45:22.230 --> 01:45:23.491]  No, it's all a giant hoax, sir.
[01:45:24.072 --> 01:45:25.653]  More people died in 2017 than died in 2020.
[01:45:25.733 --> 01:45:28.675]  All a bunch of insanity.
[01:45:28.695 --> 01:45:30.257]  I just wanted to get your thoughts on that.
[01:45:30.677 --> 01:45:31.898]  No, I totally agree with you.
[01:45:31.918 --> 01:45:36.742]  Liberals want to be like, oh, I'm taking care of myself.
[01:45:36.762 --> 01:45:37.482]  I'll wear a mask.
[01:45:38.003 --> 01:45:39.204]  Oh, I'm good.
[01:45:39.404 --> 01:45:41.105]  It's all posers.
[01:45:41.145 --> 01:45:41.786]  They're posers.
[01:45:42.697 --> 01:45:45.140]  And nobody calls them out, so they're never gonna take them off, man.
[01:45:45.160 --> 01:45:45.820]  They love it.
[01:45:46.481 --> 01:45:47.662]  It's like, oh, I'm Batman.
[01:45:47.702 --> 01:45:48.463]  I'm wearing a mask.
[01:45:49.945 --> 01:45:50.805]  Yeah, I agree.
[01:45:50.886 --> 01:45:54.129]  It's, uh, you know, I'm in socialist Chicago where... I'm Bane here.
[01:45:54.329 --> 01:45:55.150]  Oh, Batman.
[01:45:55.170 --> 01:45:56.051]  You like the dark?
[01:45:56.131 --> 01:45:58.273]  I was born in the dark, Batman.
[01:46:00.696 --> 01:46:02.297]  Yeah, I can't agree with you more, man.
[01:46:02.357 --> 01:46:03.779]  It's, uh... So what do we do about it?
[01:46:05.677 --> 01:46:06.417]  What do we do about it?
[01:46:06.437 --> 01:46:09.898]  Just try to get the word out, you know, against all this bullcrap going on.
[01:46:09.918 --> 01:46:11.838]  I saw that you did that piece on L.C.
[01:46:11.898 --> 01:46:13.278]  Oaks, which I thought was amazing.
[01:46:13.918 --> 01:46:16.619]  I've been sharing all his stuff on, you know, Facebook, which... L.C.
[01:46:16.719 --> 01:46:18.419]  Oaks is an archetypal American.
[01:46:18.479 --> 01:46:19.839]  He is the model of victory.
[01:46:19.959 --> 01:46:20.440]  I love him.
[01:46:20.460 --> 01:46:21.280]  We're going to work with him more.
[01:46:21.300 --> 01:46:23.080]  Yeah, he's amazing.
[01:46:23.180 --> 01:46:25.700]  And I've already showed about 100 people that they've all shared it.
[01:46:25.720 --> 01:46:29.261]  He's got thousands of hits on Facebook, which obviously is an evil website.
[01:46:29.621 --> 01:46:30.641]  Everybody will agree on that.
[01:46:30.701 --> 01:46:31.481]  No, no.
[01:46:31.501 --> 01:46:32.242]  We know it's evil.
[01:46:32.282 --> 01:46:34.082]  Please support Bandot Video.
[01:46:34.858 --> 01:46:37.459]  Please post it everywhere.
[01:46:37.519 --> 01:46:38.420]  Please email it out.
[01:46:38.460 --> 01:46:40.221]  Please text message it.
[01:46:40.701 --> 01:46:46.784]  Please take today's reports that have already gone up at Infowars.com and Don Salazar's article about the smoking gun.
[01:46:46.824 --> 01:46:47.584]  Please put it back on screen.
[01:46:47.604 --> 01:46:48.705]  Thank you for the call, Tom.
[01:46:49.125 --> 01:46:50.025]  Put it back on screen, please.
[01:46:50.946 --> 01:46:54.407]  Smoking gun, smoking gun, smoking gun.
[01:46:54.868 --> 01:47:00.210]  Joe Biden's Department of Energy blocked Texas from increasing power ahead of killer storm.
[01:47:02.051 --> 01:47:03.972]  A week before, Texas begged
[01:47:05.393 --> 01:47:12.479]  Or help and ask the Department of Energy to lift federal regulations barring states energy output.
[01:47:13.500 --> 01:47:13.961]  But it didn't.
[01:47:15.575 --> 01:47:20.556]  This is the smoking gun, and it needs to get out there, because they're all Texas sucks.
[01:47:20.596 --> 01:47:21.176]  They're idiots.
[01:47:21.477 --> 01:47:22.697]  They ride horses to work.
[01:47:22.737 --> 01:47:24.597]  They have outhouses.
[01:47:25.097 --> 01:47:26.158]  They marry their sisters.
[01:47:26.218 --> 01:47:27.258]  Ha ha ha ha ha.
[01:47:27.518 --> 01:47:29.759]  That's why NASA's down here, and it's the model.
[01:47:29.819 --> 01:47:33.099]  If they can break our private energy system, they can break all of you.
[01:47:33.540 --> 01:47:34.160]  All right, get ready.
[01:47:34.200 --> 01:47:36.020]  Back in a few minutes with CDJ.
[01:47:39.614 --> 01:47:40.775]  And so many others.
[01:47:40.815 --> 01:47:41.436]  Please stay with us.
[01:47:42.037 --> 01:47:44.880]  Imagine you get a call saying, hey, I'm working here in this power plant.
[01:47:44.920 --> 01:47:46.642]  I know this is this person.
[01:47:46.682 --> 01:47:48.924]  Well, they say we're at 10% capacity.
[01:47:49.004 --> 01:47:50.886]  We have a railway coming here with coal.
[01:47:51.367 --> 01:47:53.389]  We don't have coal to run Houston for weeks.
[01:47:54.490 --> 01:47:58.734]  And we supply the power grid and they won't let us turn the grid on.
[01:47:59.735 --> 01:48:00.877]  And I asked the person, I said, well,
[01:48:02.298 --> 01:48:02.738]  What's going on?
[01:48:02.778 --> 01:48:06.140]  They said, I'm just told by our superiors the feds control what we can do.
[01:48:06.680 --> 01:48:07.420]  They said, you know that.
[01:48:07.460 --> 01:48:08.421]  Look at the federal agreements.
[01:48:08.441 --> 01:48:09.621]  Look at what Obama did.
[01:48:10.161 --> 01:48:13.903]  I'm like, oh, oh, I've been told by sources the plants are turned down.
[01:48:15.643 --> 01:48:18.206]  And I'm mad at myself because finally Lister sent me this order.
[01:48:18.507 --> 01:48:19.748]  It's now going viral on Twitter.
[01:48:20.169 --> 01:48:22.792]  And it just says, you will not use any of your power.
[01:48:22.832 --> 01:48:23.933]  You'll use outside power.
[01:48:24.494 --> 01:48:26.717]  They're going to have real trouble spending this, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:48:27.117 --> 01:48:27.698]  Real trouble.
[01:48:28.198 --> 01:48:32.143]  I mean, the comments on Twitter are people are really getting this now.
[01:48:32.343 --> 01:48:33.184]  It is exploding.
[01:48:33.545 --> 01:48:34.907]  Crimes against humanity.
[01:48:36.476 --> 01:48:39.897]  We've got Max Keiser popping in for a few segments, then Joel Skousen.
[01:48:40.317 --> 01:48:41.058]  Really smart folks.
[01:48:41.078 --> 01:48:43.799]  That's coming up next hour in the War Room, 3 to 6 p.m.
[01:48:43.819 --> 01:48:44.779]  You'll want to dial into that.
[01:48:45.099 --> 01:48:46.320]  Let's race through these calls.
[01:48:46.360 --> 01:48:47.800]  A lot of amazing callers.
[01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:51.161]  So again, who's been holding the longest now?
[01:48:51.722 --> 01:48:52.862]  That would be C.D.
[01:48:52.942 --> 01:48:53.722]  in Oklahoma.
[01:48:54.523 --> 01:48:57.644]  Talk about another energy-independent powerhouse state.
[01:48:58.124 --> 01:49:00.325]  Pretty soon they'll say Oklahoma can't have power either.
[01:49:00.985 --> 01:49:02.766]  Talk about coal, talk about oil, talk about gas.
[01:49:02.826 --> 01:49:03.766]  It's as rich as Texas.
[01:49:04.226 --> 01:49:05.687]  C.D., what do you make of this situation?
[01:49:07.484 --> 01:49:09.085]  Oh man, it's crazy.
[01:49:09.485 --> 01:49:13.366]  We're in that Southwest Power Pool, so they had us doing rolling blackouts as well.
[01:49:15.347 --> 01:49:19.229]  But real quick, I wanted to plug Alpha Power, Super Mail, and Turbo Force.
[01:49:19.309 --> 01:49:22.510]  I don't drink coffee, so that little combination is like coffee for me in the morning.
[01:49:22.570 --> 01:49:23.971]  It's a good boost, gets me through the day.
[01:49:23.991 --> 01:49:26.792]  I love it.
[01:49:27.332 --> 01:49:36.676]  So on the power outages, there were people in Oklahoma without power, freezing to death, you know, because we got hit with the same storm you guys got hit with.
[01:49:37.973 --> 01:49:49.519]  And they're sitting in the cold, freezing, and we've got a National Basketball Association team called Oklahoma City Thunder, and they have dead the whole arena with power.
[01:49:49.539 --> 01:49:53.701]  You know, they played their basketball game, and that was all good and fun while people sat in the cold, freezing.
[01:49:54.481 --> 01:50:04.586]  That's what technocracy is, is they go, oh, downtown Austin stays open, all Ericott stays open, but I'm in the dark for six days with the toilets overflowing.
[01:50:04.626 --> 01:50:05.086]  Exactly.
[01:50:05.126 --> 01:50:06.227]  Yeah, it's sick, isn't it?
[01:50:07.048 --> 01:50:08.210]  Yeah, it's disgusting.
[01:50:08.250 --> 01:50:21.547]  And we have a Republican mayor, who calls himself a Republican, named Mayor David Holt, who acts like he's powerless to do anything against them and pretty much told us that the NBA owns Oklahoma City.
[01:50:22.313 --> 01:50:23.354]  And they can do whatever they want.
[01:50:23.374 --> 01:50:23.854]  It's up to them.
[01:50:23.874 --> 01:50:24.754]  It's in their contract.
[01:50:25.114 --> 01:50:27.315]  Yeah, but he diverts to them.
[01:50:27.455 --> 01:50:32.618]  It's in the contract that entertainment and downtown stuff is essential.
[01:50:32.738 --> 01:50:33.678]  That's a technocracy.
[01:50:33.698 --> 01:50:34.599]  It's a new class system.
[01:50:34.919 --> 01:50:38.841]  We're all fighting over black or white or whatever, and then meanwhile it's all a class system.
[01:50:40.250 --> 01:50:42.591]  He's just another spineless rhino.
[01:50:42.951 --> 01:50:47.033]  And I'm not a fan of our governor either, who is groveling and begging for help.
[01:50:47.213 --> 01:50:47.754]  No, I agree.
[01:50:47.854 --> 01:50:50.755]  Oklahoma used to be better than Texas, and Texas is in trouble too.
[01:50:51.195 --> 01:50:54.037]  The last couple years, Oklahoma took a left turn, man.
[01:50:55.698 --> 01:50:58.079]  Yeah, it's getting a little bad.
[01:50:58.139 --> 01:51:01.741]  But luckily, this election cycle, we stayed all red and we threw out our Democrat
[01:51:03.177 --> 01:51:06.320]  No, I know you're way better than Texas, brother.
[01:51:06.340 --> 01:51:11.765]  I actually envy Oklahoma, but to see Oklahoma slip some, you know, and it just scares the hell out of me.
[01:51:11.785 --> 01:51:12.246]  God bless you.
[01:51:12.266 --> 01:51:12.866]  Thanks for the call.
[01:51:13.427 --> 01:51:17.951]  All right, up next is Jay in California.
[01:51:17.971 --> 01:51:18.331]  Go ahead.
[01:51:21.914 --> 01:51:22.435]  Hi, Jay.
[01:51:22.755 --> 01:51:24.637]  You say the next step is the Green New Deal.
[01:51:24.657 --> 01:51:24.637]  100%.
[01:51:25.377 --> 01:51:26.959]  This is preparing us for the new Green Deal.
[01:51:31.749 --> 01:51:34.030]  Sounds like Jay is already on the new Green Deal.
[01:51:35.070 --> 01:51:36.951]  Because with the new Green Deal, you won't have any communications.
[01:51:37.071 --> 01:51:38.611]  Alright, Jay.
[01:51:38.671 --> 01:51:40.512]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:51:40.572 --> 01:51:41.452]  Who is up next?
[01:51:41.552 --> 01:51:45.613]  Let's talk to Chantel in Illinois.
[01:51:45.653 --> 01:51:46.853]  Thank you for holding, Chantel.
[01:51:46.873 --> 01:51:47.274]  Go ahead.
[01:51:48.354 --> 01:51:51.755]  Hi, I was wondering if you knew about Cladex.
[01:51:51.895 --> 01:51:53.375]  It was a war game.
[01:51:56.317 --> 01:52:01.218]  That John Hopkins headed up with Fauci in 2018.
[01:52:02.179 --> 01:52:03.359]  Yes, I've heard of it.
[01:52:03.419 --> 01:52:05.179]  Say it again so they can pull it up on the computer.
[01:52:05.239 --> 01:52:05.800]  Is it CloudX?
[01:52:05.840 --> 01:52:06.420]  It's C-L-A-D-E.
[01:52:07.300 --> 01:52:12.181]  It was Disease X. Oh, the U.N.
[01:52:12.221 --> 01:52:13.242]  Disease X drill.
[01:52:13.842 --> 01:52:15.462]  Yes, that's part of Lockstep.
[01:52:15.862 --> 01:52:16.763]  That's part of Lockstep.
[01:52:16.803 --> 01:52:17.803]  That's part of Event 201.
[01:52:17.883 --> 01:52:18.103]  Yes, 100%.
[01:52:18.143 --> 01:52:19.403]  The U.N.
[01:52:19.423 --> 01:52:20.104]  said it's coming.
[01:52:20.124 --> 01:52:20.984]  Get ready for world government.
[01:52:21.004 --> 01:52:21.904]  Get ready for lockdown.
[01:52:22.284 --> 01:52:24.605]  And they use that to tell all their criminal operatives what they're about to do.
[01:52:24.625 --> 01:52:24.705]  Yeah.
[01:52:26.155 --> 01:52:34.260]  Yeah, and they isolated smallpox one and smallpox two from this mummy, and supposedly that's the only human that's ever had both at the same time.
[01:52:34.880 --> 01:52:37.822]  And so that's apparently isolated in a lab.
[01:52:38.362 --> 01:52:42.565]  And so they war game that it comes out of Venezuela and Germany.
[01:52:42.965 --> 01:52:52.531]  And Melinda Gates made a speech saying, or a talk, saying that we no longer have to concentrate on fighting virus or avoiding virus, but
[01:52:53.103 --> 01:52:55.726]  We have to concentrate on germ warfare.
[01:53:12.102 --> 01:53:21.044]  They'll sit around and go, we're going to simulate this, it's coming soon, we'll lock down the borders, maybe we'll stay in their houses, and then we'll make them take shots and bring in a digital controlled currency.
[01:53:21.084 --> 01:53:21.964]  Alright, alright.
[01:53:22.445 --> 01:53:23.325]  It's only a drill.
[01:53:23.405 --> 01:53:24.365]  Ha ha ha ha.
[01:53:24.705 --> 01:53:25.245]  Then they do it.
[01:53:25.325 --> 01:53:25.825]  Absolutely.
[01:53:27.246 --> 01:53:29.186]  Yeah, 900 million dead simulated.
[01:53:30.506 --> 01:53:31.127]  Not too pretty.
[01:53:32.707 --> 01:53:33.687]  Yeah, well that's the thing.
[01:53:33.707 --> 01:53:37.668]  You notice Bill Gates said, the next bio release will kill billions.
[01:53:38.088 --> 01:53:40.229]  So they're just gearing us up for the main attack.
[01:53:40.289 --> 01:53:40.709]  I agree with you.
[01:53:41.914 --> 01:53:51.920]  Yeah, and then they practiced, because there was talk about over-promise of vaccines in the past, which I mean, which I think they're meaning what we've done in COVID.
[01:53:51.940 --> 01:53:54.942]  Well, yeah, they use that to keep the lockdown going.
[01:53:54.962 --> 01:54:00.625]  I think I have an article right here where they're saying, oh, if you've had the vaccine, though, you'll be allowed to go out in public, just like Israel's announced.
[01:54:00.645 --> 01:54:02.026]  So it's a two-tiered system.
[01:54:02.046 --> 01:54:06.789]  If you let us put in your body what we want, we'll let you go to the mall or the grocery store.
[01:54:07.129 --> 01:54:08.010]  Aren't we lucky?
[01:54:09.734 --> 01:54:17.456]  Yeah, and they practiced having the state leaders go home and manage their states on a local level once this disease gets released and stuff.
[01:54:17.976 --> 01:54:18.737]  It's really crazy.
[01:54:18.777 --> 01:54:20.537]  I listened to the whole video on it.
[01:54:21.357 --> 01:54:23.618]  And you noticed in the pre-planning, right?
[01:54:23.638 --> 01:54:25.338]  These are conspirators planning against you.
[01:54:26.819 --> 01:54:27.079]  Yeah.
[01:54:27.959 --> 01:54:32.900]  What was it like to see these Lex Luthor type folks planning against you?
[01:54:34.761 --> 01:54:35.381]  It's evil.
[01:54:35.741 --> 01:54:36.421]  It's so evil.
[01:54:36.842 --> 01:54:37.122]  I mean, I
[01:54:38.607 --> 01:54:40.974]  I pray all the time, you know, for protection.
[01:54:40.994 --> 01:54:42.498]  And I have three kids, you know, 19 to 25.
[01:54:44.896 --> 01:54:47.597]  And I'm begging them, don't get the vaccine.
[01:54:47.777 --> 01:54:52.537]  You know, you do your due diligence and research this thing.
[01:54:52.597 --> 01:54:54.318]  What about the waitress in New York?
[01:54:54.838 --> 01:54:56.118]  She goes, it's unapproved.
[01:54:56.278 --> 01:54:56.778]  I don't want it.
[01:54:56.818 --> 01:55:01.059]  They go, you're fired, as if they're a doctor, as if they get to know about her medical history.
[01:55:01.339 --> 01:55:10.921]  Since when does a woman or a man that you work with, you know, since you know their medical history, just think about this revolution of corporations doing this.
[01:55:11.241 --> 01:55:12.401]  They are raping us.
[01:55:13.985 --> 01:55:22.419]  Oh yeah, I had a lady, I work in stores and I have a clear mask because I can't handle wearing those masks and I have to wear something to do my job.
[01:55:23.610 --> 01:55:28.474]  And I had my hearing aids on, I was listening to your podcast through my hearing aids, so I didn't know she was talking to me.
[01:55:28.874 --> 01:55:34.639]  And I turn around, she's yelling something at me, so I turn down the podcast, and she's like, put your mask on!
[01:55:35.060 --> 01:55:38.663]  And I'm tapping on the clear thing, and she goes, I'm in the health industry!
[01:55:38.983 --> 01:55:45.729]  And I said, well, I have a bad heart, I've already had open heart surgery, so if I faint and pass out, then you'll get your cookie!
[01:55:45.749 --> 01:55:47.170]  I was so mad!
[01:55:47.510 --> 01:55:48.792]  I was shaking the whole day from that!
[01:55:49.987 --> 01:55:52.809]  What's this Karen lady doing, trying to, you know?
[01:55:52.909 --> 01:55:54.610]  Well, they're always the biggest Nazis.
[01:55:54.971 --> 01:55:56.011]  Chantel, we love you.
[01:55:56.031 --> 01:55:56.652]  Stay safe.
[01:55:57.172 --> 01:55:58.393]  We appreciate your call.
[01:55:59.234 --> 01:56:02.476]  I'm going to jam in some more calls when we come back for five minutes.
[01:56:03.257 --> 01:56:05.758]  And then we've got the next guest joining us.
[01:56:06.239 --> 01:56:07.640]  But wow, what amazing callers.
[01:56:07.820 --> 01:56:17.327]  And I'm tempted to come in tomorrow, on Saturday, just to show for medical workers to tell their stories specifically, because we got mainly power outage stories, but just simply insane.
[01:56:18.280 --> 01:56:21.082]  Speaking of power outages, we don't have George Soros funding us.
[01:56:21.102 --> 01:56:23.543]  The Globalist, The New World Order, we're funded by viewers like you.

[01:56:43.254 --> 01:56:44.315]  So that's drop shipped.
[01:56:44.675 --> 01:56:48.597]  So is the Alexa Pure Pro Gravity Fed Filter that's $50 off.

[01:57:32.742 --> 01:57:33.262]  Yeah, that's great.
[01:57:33.762 --> 01:57:36.303]  InfowarStore.com, you keep us on air and I appreciate you.
[01:57:36.323 --> 01:57:41.785]  And I'm sorry I plug so much, but the stations want their local ads and nobody responds to those for us.
[01:57:42.305 --> 01:57:45.367]  And then it helps local stations, but then for us, we plug live on air.
[01:57:45.887 --> 01:57:49.068]  All right, we'll be right back with our number four.
[01:57:49.568 --> 01:57:59.572]  We'll jam in some more phone calls and then Max Keiser joins us to talk about what's happening in the financial markets and Joel Skousen on strategic relocation.
[01:57:59.592 --> 01:58:00.032]  Stay with us.
[01:58:01.215 --> 01:58:02.796]  Okay, Alex Jones here, back live.
[01:58:02.857 --> 01:58:04.538]  Max Keiser coming up in about six minutes.
[01:58:05.098 --> 01:58:05.779]  We're taking calls.
[01:58:05.819 --> 01:58:07.180]  The order, they are received.
[01:58:07.320 --> 01:58:08.201]  Matt is up next.
[01:58:09.262 --> 01:58:10.824]  And then is Jody.
[01:58:11.444 --> 01:58:12.985]  Matt in Utah, thank you.
[01:58:13.666 --> 01:58:15.708]  You're calling in about the power grid outages.
[01:58:16.208 --> 01:58:17.129]  What is your take on this?
[01:58:18.650 --> 01:58:20.092]  Hey, Alex, how are you?
[01:58:20.872 --> 01:58:21.493]  I'm all right, brother.
[01:58:21.533 --> 01:58:22.554]  Talking to you, so I'm good.
[01:58:23.274 --> 01:58:23.715]  All righty.
[01:58:23.735 --> 01:58:24.435]  All righty.
[01:58:24.455 --> 01:58:27.018]  So you remember back during 2015, Jade Helm,
[01:58:28.894 --> 01:58:33.855]  They had that map out that said Texas and Utah were enemy territory.
[01:58:34.395 --> 01:58:37.616]  Utah was named enemy territory because of our food stores.
[01:58:38.096 --> 01:58:40.757]  Now, we have not gotten snow up here this year.
[01:58:41.257 --> 01:58:45.698]  And two weeks ago, we had brown snow falling out of the sky.
[01:58:46.418 --> 01:58:48.318]  A couple days after that, our power went out.
[01:58:48.338 --> 01:58:54.980]  A couple days after that, Rocky Mountain Power come out and said, your power outages are blamed on the brown snow.
[01:58:55.860 --> 01:58:56.640]  Explain that.
[01:58:57.287 --> 01:59:02.011]  With HAARP and everything else, I think they're trying to starve Utah for their food stores.
[01:59:02.251 --> 01:59:06.855]  Well, I do have the former head of the CIA saying they control the weather.
[01:59:07.375 --> 01:59:10.018]  And China's in the mainstream news saying they control the whole country's weather.
[01:59:10.058 --> 01:59:14.141]  So for us to say that that's a possibility is completely in the realm of reality.
[01:59:14.421 --> 01:59:15.142]  I mean, I don't know.
[01:59:16.103 --> 01:59:17.464]  Greatest snow on earth, man.
[01:59:17.504 --> 01:59:19.405]  We have not had any snow this year.
[01:59:19.425 --> 01:59:22.588]  We're so far behind and we're not going to be able to grow.
[01:59:22.948 --> 01:59:24.289]  Our yields are going to be way down.
[01:59:24.349 --> 01:59:25.871]  How are we going to make our food stores?
[01:59:26.573 --> 01:59:27.494]  I mean, you know?
[01:59:27.534 --> 01:59:30.416]  No, you're absolutely right that a lot of hellish stuff's going on.
[01:59:30.597 --> 01:59:36.301]  I mean, what do you make of this Department of Energy document I showed where they said Texas wasn't allowed to turn their power on?
[01:59:36.321 --> 01:59:37.562]  I mean, that's smoking gun!
[01:59:38.643 --> 01:59:44.048]  Man, it is smoking gun, and the thing is, they have been lying to us forever.
[01:59:44.468 --> 01:59:49.473]  Anybody who believes anything that comes out of their government's mouth is out of their mind.
[01:59:49.853 --> 01:59:54.377]  And the thing is, it doesn't matter, because my kingdom is not of this world.
[01:59:55.069 --> 01:59:55.409]  Period.
[01:59:55.629 --> 01:59:56.250]  End of story.
[01:59:56.730 --> 01:59:57.290]  I agree, Matt.
[01:59:57.370 --> 01:59:58.271]  Thank you so much.
[01:59:58.291 --> 01:59:59.492]  I'm going to jam in the next caller.
[02:00:00.212 --> 02:00:03.254]  Let's go to Jody in Arkansas, who also had massive power outages.
[02:00:03.274 --> 02:00:04.174]  This is still ongoing.
[02:00:04.214 --> 02:00:05.235]  Jody, what's your take on this?
[02:00:06.156 --> 02:00:06.556]  Hey, Alex.
[02:00:06.596 --> 02:00:07.616]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:00:07.837 --> 02:00:10.058]  I was afraid my call was going to be a little off the subject.
[02:00:10.278 --> 02:00:13.060]  So I heard you mention the National Guard earlier.
[02:00:14.581 --> 02:00:18.583]  I live not a mile from the back entrance of a National Guard base.
[02:00:19.223 --> 02:00:23.546]  And I can tell you over the past two or three months, the amount of military drilling
[02:00:24.136 --> 02:00:25.337]  I don't know what's going on there.
[02:00:43.410 --> 02:00:54.036]  That's what, I have to reach down and think, I kept reaching down thinking the National Guard is preparing to help us, but I don't think that's the case.
[02:00:54.056 --> 02:00:59.039]  Well I don't think they're General Honoré, but General Honoré literally, Tucker Carlson covered him, sounds like a complete lunatic.
[02:00:59.059 --> 02:01:09.646]  He's like, the white person is the enemy, America's bad, we're gonna fight them right, I mean, he says the police are white supremacists at the Capitol, they help the rioters, all pure crap.
[02:01:10.066 --> 02:01:11.387]  I mean, just crazy talent.
[02:01:13.312 --> 02:01:22.295]  And it was January 7th, I believe, there were explosions here that were shaking houses, cracking windows.
[02:01:22.936 --> 02:01:25.877]  I was fishing 12 miles away and it was rippling the water.
[02:01:27.177 --> 02:01:28.718]  They're probably testing truck bombs out.
[02:01:28.738 --> 02:01:30.438]  They're going to bomb and say right-wingers did.
[02:01:31.138 --> 02:01:32.459]  I was afraid of, yeah.
[02:01:33.123 --> 02:01:35.365]  So, I was just wanting to let you know about that.
[02:01:35.485 --> 02:01:41.209]  You know the ATF tested a few months ago for Oklahoma City, out in Nevada, a rider truck.
[02:01:41.229 --> 02:01:44.312]  So yeah, that's what you thought when you heard it?
[02:01:44.332 --> 02:01:52.178]  Yeah, I couldn't... I mean, when I saw the ripples in the water, I thought it was just someone blasting right next to the lake.
[02:01:53.058 --> 02:01:56.141]  But no, it was happening 12 miles away.
[02:01:56.601 --> 02:01:58.682]  The explosions were that strong.
[02:01:58.702 --> 02:02:01.765]  Yeah, there's a KAIT News 8 saying that happened.
[02:02:02.751 --> 02:02:07.195]  Yeah, and I've, you know, I've been in health, I'm a retired healthcare worker.
[02:02:07.836 --> 02:02:12.560]  I was an RN and then I was a PA in cardiothoracic surgery for over 12 years.
[02:02:13.160 --> 02:02:18.685]  And I can say all of this as far as, this is a change in the subject, but the masks are pointless.
[02:02:19.045 --> 02:02:19.686]  They're ridiculous.
[02:02:21.627 --> 02:02:23.069]  My dad's a doctor, that's what he says.
[02:02:23.549 --> 02:02:24.870]  It's all about we're dirty though.
[02:02:24.910 --> 02:02:25.831]  It's all about we're bad.
[02:02:25.871 --> 02:02:29.134]  To see the mask, to know we're in an emergency, to be reminded of the propaganda.
[02:02:31.044 --> 02:02:35.627]  I just wanted to let you know and I wanted to say thank you for all of you that are up there and going through all this right now.
[02:02:35.827 --> 02:02:36.567]  I appreciate you guys.
[02:02:36.587 --> 02:02:39.108]  God bless you, brother, and thanks for telling me that's going on.
[02:02:39.349 --> 02:02:40.169]  Guys, print me that article.
[02:02:40.189 --> 02:02:40.849]  That's key intel.
[02:02:41.410 --> 02:02:45.752]  Yeah, this is truck bomb city, in my view, and it was actually in Arkansas.
[02:02:45.772 --> 02:02:48.394]  They tested one of the truck bombs they used in Oklahoma City.
[02:02:49.414 --> 02:02:51.415]  Yeah, it's all coming back to me now.
[02:02:51.435 --> 02:02:52.296]  Oh, man.
[02:02:55.245 --> 02:02:58.426]  All right, Max Keiser is with us for two short segments, then Joel Skousen.
[02:02:59.247 --> 02:03:08.831]  Max is here because his predictions of 10 years ago with me on air, his predictions of five years ago, two years ago, a year ago, a month ago, are coming true.
[02:03:08.891 --> 02:03:13.433]  Bitcoin has turbocharged, basically doubling its value in just the last
[02:03:14.393 --> 02:03:18.578]  A few months, it's insane, to $55,183 per Bitcoin.
[02:03:19.059 --> 02:03:20.300]  What in Hades is going on?
[02:03:20.320 --> 02:03:22.783]  And what does this signify for the larger markets?
[02:03:22.843 --> 02:03:28.170]  Max Keiser, international TV host and former top stock trader, thanks for joining us.
[02:03:29.301 --> 02:03:33.143]  Yeah, Alex, so Bitcoin hit an important milestone today.
[02:03:33.744 --> 02:03:36.025]  It's now worth over $1 trillion.
[02:03:37.066 --> 02:03:45.050]  When we first started talking to you about Bitcoin about 10 years ago, its market capitalization was under $20 million.
[02:03:45.351 --> 02:03:47.672]  Can I have that $10,000 you offered me for free again?
[02:03:48.613 --> 02:03:49.453]  Absolutely, Alex.
[02:03:49.493 --> 02:03:53.295]  I've been keeping it in storage for you, just waiting for you to ask.
[02:03:53.595 --> 02:03:55.096]  And I'll just send it right over.
[02:03:55.116 --> 02:03:57.518]  How much would that be worth now, compadre?
[02:03:58.793 --> 02:04:03.316]  That would be worth $500 million, almost $600 million.
[02:04:03.436 --> 02:04:06.539]  Okay, thank you.
[02:04:08.060 --> 02:04:13.203]  Well, I mean, but you do sell a lot of that testicle-improving medication, so there's that.
[02:04:13.483 --> 02:04:14.664]  Talk about missing the boat.
[02:04:14.724 --> 02:04:15.805]  Okay, please continue.
[02:04:17.066 --> 02:04:21.629]  So, it's over a trillion dollars market cap, which is very important because
[02:04:22.723 --> 02:04:24.704]  You know, where do you want me to start on this?
[02:04:24.744 --> 02:04:28.045]  Because, let me go macro, let me go big picture.
[02:04:28.085 --> 02:04:32.947]  People are starting to realize that inflation is a real problem.
[02:04:32.987 --> 02:04:38.228]  No matter what the government's telling us about it not being a problem, it's a real problem.
[02:04:38.268 --> 02:04:40.289]  And what Bitcoin's been telling us is that the U.S.
[02:04:40.309 --> 02:04:45.031]  dollar and other currencies around the world are in a hyperinflationary collapse against Bitcoin.
[02:04:45.051 --> 02:04:45.371]  That's right.
[02:04:45.451 --> 02:04:46.851]  It's the canary in the coal mine.
[02:04:46.911 --> 02:04:48.152]  It shows how weak those are.
[02:04:48.993 --> 02:04:50.735]  Right, because it's real price discovery.
[02:04:51.596 --> 02:04:54.139]  They said on CNBC today something very interesting.
[02:04:54.179 --> 02:04:58.945]  They said without Bitcoin, the price of gold would be at $3,000 right now instead of $1,700, $1,800.
[02:04:59.506 --> 02:05:02.910]  It's stealing market capitalization away from gold.
[02:05:02.990 --> 02:05:04.933]  And by the way, you said that a few weeks ago on the show.
[02:05:05.748 --> 02:05:07.888]  Yeah, I absolutely did.
[02:05:08.288 --> 02:05:12.389]  The other problem with gold is that the price is manipulated.
[02:05:12.429 --> 02:05:22.511]  You know, JP Morgan's paid many fines already for manipulating the price of gold, but they don't seem to want to enforce the laws about anti-manipulation.
[02:05:22.951 --> 02:05:30.113]  So I don't see gold or silver breaking out of their current range because they're just trapped by those folks that don't want it to go higher.
[02:05:30.213 --> 02:05:31.413]  Is that the naked shorting?
[02:05:32.702 --> 02:05:32.922]  Right.
[02:05:32.982 --> 02:05:35.963]  The naked shorting, which is basically selling counterfeit.
[02:05:36.524 --> 02:05:46.328]  In the case of GameStop, the scandal from last week, you had Melvin Capital was selling counterfeit shares on the open market to manipulate the stock price down.
[02:05:46.728 --> 02:05:47.368]  It's illegal.
[02:05:47.448 --> 02:05:48.989]  The regulators don't enforce it, though.
[02:05:49.389 --> 02:05:55.092]  In the case of silver and the paper market on the silver futures market, you've got players who sell counterfeit sell orders.
[02:05:55.672 --> 02:06:13.514]  Or naked shorting to move to bang the price down and it's been proven many many times before and the banks admit that they're doing it but they they claim that it's very important to be systemically key to keeping the US dollar as world reserve currency but what's happening around the world is that countries are dumping their dollars
[02:06:14.174 --> 02:06:20.575]  Countries like China and Russia, Iran are all dumping their dollars and they're loading up on gold and now they're starting to buy Bitcoin.
[02:06:20.615 --> 02:06:28.777]  So a lot of these countries like Iran and others are actually big players in the Bitcoin space because it's uncensorable, right?
[02:06:28.817 --> 02:06:29.437]  So when the U.S.
[02:06:29.457 --> 02:06:32.498]  tries to censor Iran, they just do deals in Bitcoin.
[02:06:32.538 --> 02:06:34.038]  Let me toot your horn for a moment.
[02:06:34.058 --> 02:06:39.559]  You're the first guy who ever told me about Bitcoin and you were on a few months ago and then a few weeks ago, it wasn't last week, it was about two, three weeks ago.
[02:06:40.279 --> 02:06:42.620]  And you said, watch, it's about to make giant moves.
[02:06:42.800 --> 02:06:47.802]  About a week later, Elon Musk comes out and the big banks endorse it and it did the stratospheric rise.
[02:06:47.842 --> 02:06:51.224]  So you just sensed that in the wind or what was happening?
[02:06:55.165 --> 02:06:58.166]  Again, if you start with the big picture, it starts to make more sense.
[02:06:58.186 --> 02:06:59.687]  The big picture is that the U.S.
[02:06:59.707 --> 02:07:04.009]  dollar is being inflated away and the value is dying.
[02:07:04.827 --> 02:07:07.168]  And so corporations and they're really the big move.
[02:07:07.388 --> 02:07:09.709]  Alex started with a guy named Michael Saylor.
[02:07:09.949 --> 02:07:12.190]  He's the CEO of a company called MicroStrategy.
[02:07:12.670 --> 02:07:17.112]  And over the summer, he announced that he had put almost a billion dollars into Bitcoin.
[02:07:17.132 --> 02:07:18.973]  And he made his case very simply.
[02:07:19.013 --> 02:07:19.533]  He said, look,
[02:07:20.370 --> 02:07:22.831]  I don't want to put my cash into the U.S.
[02:07:22.871 --> 02:07:24.012]  dollar because the U.S.
[02:07:24.052 --> 02:07:27.333]  dollar is losing 15 to 20 percent a year in purchasing power.
[02:07:27.814 --> 02:07:28.734]  It's stupid for me.
[02:07:28.754 --> 02:07:35.237]  So if a flight from the dollar and other major currencies is of devaluation, then Bitcoin's king, so that's going to rise.
[02:07:35.277 --> 02:07:36.058]  It's an easy question.
[02:07:36.798 --> 02:07:36.998]  Right.
[02:07:37.078 --> 02:07:38.659]  It's the fastest horse in the race.
[02:07:39.360 --> 02:07:44.423]  As Paul Tudor Jones, he said this over a year ago, and I believe we talked a little bit about that as well.
[02:07:44.463 --> 02:07:47.686]  He's probably the preeminent hedge fund manager in America.
[02:07:47.746 --> 02:07:49.447]  He came out and said, look, I'm buying Bitcoin.
[02:07:49.487 --> 02:07:51.228]  I've got one percent of my portfolio in Bitcoin.
[02:07:51.268 --> 02:07:56.812]  It's the fastest horse in the race because he also owns a little gold, but he's looking for inflation to really break out.
[02:07:57.112 --> 02:08:00.234]  And what are we seeing now in the commodity markets?
[02:08:00.254 --> 02:08:02.676]  You're seeing lumber at a thousand dollars.
[02:08:02.776 --> 02:08:04.217]  It's at a new all time high.
[02:08:04.277 --> 02:08:05.938]  Natural gas is going straight up.
[02:08:07.054 --> 02:08:10.339]  Right, the commodities are entering into a secular bull market.
[02:08:10.999 --> 02:08:16.326]  Heinz, the food company, is saying we've got to start passing these price increases on to the consumer.
[02:08:16.767 --> 02:08:21.473]  So people are going to start to see now at the store and at the petrol station actual price...
[02:08:22.234 --> 02:08:25.136]  Going up in a way that's going to be alarming for people.
[02:08:25.716 --> 02:08:29.118]  This is another wave of disenfranchisement for folks in America.
[02:08:29.379 --> 02:08:32.160]  The purchasing power of their dollars is really going to start to hurt.
[02:08:32.461 --> 02:08:40.766]  So there's a mad flight into how to protect my assets, and there's really only one choice at this moment where it's not manipulated, and that is Bitcoin.
[02:08:41.046 --> 02:08:42.687]  So it's got a trillion dollar market cap.
[02:08:42.947 --> 02:08:44.848]  It's about half the market cap... Well, there's no doubt about it.
[02:08:44.868 --> 02:08:47.530]  I bought it two weeks ago, and you said I could have, like, doubled my profit.
[02:08:50.093 --> 02:08:55.558]  It's going to go to... I have a target of 2021 of $220,000 per Bitcoin.
[02:08:55.858 --> 02:08:57.400]  I've said that on your show a few times.
[02:08:57.760 --> 02:08:59.682]  I've made that public a few times.
[02:09:00.663 --> 02:08:59.682]  $220,000.
[02:09:00.763 --> 02:09:01.704]  It's now $54,000 or $55,000.
[02:09:02.524 --> 02:09:04.766]  So you've still got... Where was it two weeks ago?
[02:09:06.148 --> 02:09:12.994]  Yeah, it was... It goes... Yeah, back... It was back... At the end of last year, it was under $20,000.
[02:09:13.054 --> 02:09:13.714]  Now it's pushing $55,000.
[02:09:16.227 --> 02:09:18.530]  You know, when I talked to you originally 10 years ago, it was $10.
[02:09:18.790 --> 02:09:24.696]  You know, and it's been moving up 200% a year for 10 years.
[02:09:25.017 --> 02:09:29.221]  And the expectation is that it'll improve 200% a year for the next 10 years.
[02:09:29.281 --> 02:09:35.909]  If you go to swanbitcoin.com forward slash orange pill, you get $10 free of Bitcoin if you register.
[02:09:37.799 --> 02:09:43.804]  And again, you're not a sponsor, because last time you did this, Adam Schiff, or whatever his name is, Irwin Schiff knows his dad.
[02:09:43.945 --> 02:09:44.505]  I'm not being mean.
[02:09:44.545 --> 02:09:45.106]  Peter Schiff!
[02:09:45.706 --> 02:09:47.448]  I'm having a senile moment.
[02:09:47.808 --> 02:09:50.470]  Peter Schiff got really mad and thinks you're my sponsor, paying me to say that.
[02:09:50.931 --> 02:09:53.953]  You're just a big guy that told me about Bitcoin that I find very, very interesting.
[02:09:54.714 --> 02:09:56.136]  You've certainly been proven right so far.
[02:09:56.236 --> 02:10:00.880]  Yeah, this is a way people can get $10 worth of free Bitcoin.
[02:10:00.900 --> 02:10:05.284]  And by the way, Peter Schiff is an interesting case, because I told him to buy it at $10.
[02:10:05.585 --> 02:10:07.566]  He just admitted it recently on CNBC.
[02:10:07.606 --> 02:10:09.148]  He said, yeah, Max told me to buy it at $10.
[02:10:09.889 --> 02:10:11.610]  I told him to buy it at $100 and $1,000.
[02:10:12.351 --> 02:10:14.713]  And he's just been wrong about it, Bitcoin, for 10 years.
[02:10:15.114 --> 02:10:18.917]  He's somebody who looks to the market for signals about which way the economy is going.
[02:10:19.818 --> 02:10:21.399]  Is it true that you refuse to debate him?
[02:10:21.459 --> 02:10:23.200]  And I didn't get his name wrong on purpose, folks.
[02:10:23.240 --> 02:10:24.040]  I'm exhausted.
[02:10:24.541 --> 02:10:25.661]  The power outages and things.
[02:10:26.602 --> 02:10:28.363]  Peter Schiff, great guy, European Pacific Capital.
[02:10:28.623 --> 02:10:29.704]  Would you come on and debate him?
[02:10:30.764 --> 02:10:32.665]  Peter Schiff for brains, as I call him.
[02:10:33.446 --> 02:10:37.548]  I've already debated him several times, and I've basically cleaned the floor with him.
[02:10:37.568 --> 02:10:39.189]  You can go online right now and see me beating him.
[02:10:39.209 --> 02:10:40.490]  Why don't I get the big debate?
[02:10:40.610 --> 02:10:41.731]  I mean, I like you, Max.
[02:10:41.751 --> 02:10:42.671]  This is entertaining.
[02:10:43.031 --> 02:10:43.832]  Why can't I have you?
[02:10:45.653 --> 02:10:49.937]  Peter just, he doesn't... I'll give you three minutes and him three minutes and me one minute.
[02:10:49.997 --> 02:10:50.777]  No, you're going to do it!
[02:10:51.698 --> 02:10:54.080]  I let the market do my talking for me.
[02:10:54.220 --> 02:10:56.301]  The market, why does the market keep going up?
[02:10:56.321 --> 02:10:57.942]  Don't I get what I want?
[02:10:57.962 --> 02:11:00.584]  Do I ever get... I'm not chopped liver here, Max.
[02:11:01.445 --> 02:11:02.426]  Will you please debate?
[02:11:03.406 --> 02:11:03.827]  Peter Schiff.
[02:11:05.964 --> 02:11:16.790]  I've sworn off debating Peter Schiff because it's cruel to beat somebody up in public like that when they're bleeding out of every orifice and mumbling imbecilities.
[02:11:17.211 --> 02:11:21.813]  And his son, by the way, who I told about Bitcoin when I was at their house.
[02:11:21.833 --> 02:11:22.894]  Hold on, tell me about this.
[02:11:23.595 --> 02:11:28.698]  We are back live and yes, Max Keiser can say, ha ha ha, I told you Bitcoin was going to go way up.
[02:11:28.758 --> 02:11:29.538]  That's why we have him on.
[02:11:29.578 --> 02:11:30.519]  I was never against Bitcoin.
[02:11:32.213 --> 02:11:41.138]  But I know this, I am selling high-quality, affordable foods ready to ship to you, the lowest price you're going to find anywhere, so you have insurance you can eat during whatever this crazy time that's coming is.
[02:11:41.178 --> 02:11:43.599]  You see these digital commodities way up?
[02:11:43.639 --> 02:11:44.139]  That's great.
[02:11:44.159 --> 02:11:45.140]  Invest them if you want to.
[02:11:45.160 --> 02:11:46.260]  I'm not saying it's a bad idea.
[02:11:46.661 --> 02:11:49.022]  I'm just saying invest in something you know you can eat.
[02:11:50.853 --> 02:11:54.936]  10% off on all the storable foods, a three-month, a one-month, a six-month, a year supply.
[02:11:55.536 --> 02:11:59.258]  Infowarsstore.com, look at those thousands of five-star reviews.
[02:11:59.978 --> 02:12:01.199]  We've been in the dark here in Texas.
[02:12:01.239 --> 02:12:02.980]  It's been great to have this food here at the office.
[02:12:03.100 --> 02:12:06.982]  When everything else has been shut down for six days, we're able to feed ourselves with this.
[02:12:07.563 --> 02:12:16.688]  So, Infowarsstore.com and $50 off on the Alexa Pure Pro water filtration system, highest quality, cuts out all the garbage, a lot of their products at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:12:17.108 --> 02:12:23.478]  So Max Keiser, Max Keiser, investor, former stockbroker, author, national, international TV host.
[02:12:24.299 --> 02:12:26.663]  What do you expect next to happen in the economy?
[02:12:26.683 --> 02:12:28.646]  Do you have any comments on the power outages?
[02:12:30.365 --> 02:12:37.629]  Like Enron that you exposed 20 years ago, coming in and 10,000, 18,000 percent price increases on Texans.
[02:12:38.450 --> 02:12:41.472]  Biden ordering Texas not to up its power output.
[02:12:41.512 --> 02:12:42.272]  I have the documents.
[02:12:42.312 --> 02:12:42.992]  This is crazy.
[02:12:43.253 --> 02:12:48.996]  How does that tie into all this uncertainty and this whole electronic casino gulag you talk about?
[02:12:51.077 --> 02:12:51.397]  Sure.
[02:12:52.638 --> 02:12:55.119]  This is the way I would answer that question.
[02:12:55.520 --> 02:12:59.302]  Obviously, what's going on in Texas right now, it's an infrastructure problem.
[02:13:00.297 --> 02:13:14.809]  And it is in capability of rising to some challenges because the companies and the municipalities that are responsible for this are broke and they don't have the resources to respond to these problems.
[02:13:15.469 --> 02:13:24.637]  And we see this played out in many factors of the economy because over the past 20 or 30 years, it's been possible for corporate
[02:13:25.117 --> 02:13:26.058]  Well, I agree with you.
[02:13:26.078 --> 02:13:36.347]  The main nuclear reactor that supplies a third of the state, one reactor went down because the regulators that are private decided not to winterize the nuclear reactor.
[02:13:36.427 --> 02:13:37.628]  It could have blown up.
[02:13:37.648 --> 02:13:38.309]  That's kind of like
[02:13:50.820 --> 02:13:56.408]  At the Deepwater Horizon where they said you don't need concrete, you don't need to fill the hole, just do it with water.
[02:13:56.709 --> 02:13:58.431]  The engineers said it will blow up.
[02:13:58.831 --> 02:14:01.014]  They said we order you not to fill it.
[02:14:01.235 --> 02:14:03.218]  So there is a psychosis in these executives.
[02:14:04.147 --> 02:14:06.890]  Right, same thing with Fukushima over in Japan.
[02:14:06.930 --> 02:14:13.377]  The same private company essentially was incapable of dealing with it because all the equity had been stripped out.
[02:14:13.698 --> 02:14:22.067]  And this is a problem of the interest rates being too low for too long to keep the zombie banks going, to keep the zombie corporations going.
[02:14:22.367 --> 02:14:25.270]  And it creates this incredible problem now in the U.S.
[02:14:25.330 --> 02:14:25.531]  where
[02:14:26.252 --> 02:14:30.180]  The only way to keep the debts rolling is to keep printing more and more money.
[02:14:30.220 --> 02:14:32.063]  So the money printing is now going exponential.
[02:14:32.103 --> 02:14:37.213]  Something like 40% of all the money ever been printed in the history of the United States has been printed in the last 12 months.
[02:14:38.567 --> 02:14:50.010]  And that, if you look at the M1 or M2 chart, you can find that on the Federal Reserve website, you'll see this hockey stick-like incredible vertical move, hyperbolic.
[02:14:50.030 --> 02:14:55.192]  Sure, so clearly everything accelerates at the end of a Zimbabwe-type curve.
[02:14:55.312 --> 02:14:56.712]  And so where are we on that curve?
[02:14:57.032 --> 02:14:58.213]  Or is it Weimar Republic?
[02:14:58.313 --> 02:14:59.373]  I mean, how long do we have?
[02:15:00.768 --> 02:15:08.415]  I think we're 2021 is when you see hyperinflation completely out of control and prices start to get out of control.
[02:15:08.435 --> 02:15:10.757]  We already see the stock market and we see in the Bitcoin market.
[02:15:10.797 --> 02:15:19.304]  Bitcoin is reflecting the fact that people are jumping out of everything they possibly can and getting into Bitcoin to save themselves as a store of value.
[02:15:19.825 --> 02:15:25.570]  They would go to gold, but gold is hopelessly manipulated and the price doesn't move as CNBC said even today.
[02:15:26.210 --> 02:15:38.612]  I think eventually when Bitcoin gets over $100,000 or $150,000 a Bitcoin, and it's really hard to get Bitcoin because it's just not available, I think then people in desperation will start buying gold.
[02:15:38.912 --> 02:15:41.433]  Gold is basically the poor man's Bitcoin.
[02:15:41.593 --> 02:15:43.953]  Oh, and I agree with you just at a gut level historically.
[02:15:44.033 --> 02:15:44.913]  I think aluminum.
[02:15:44.973 --> 02:15:45.753]  I think copper.
[02:15:45.793 --> 02:15:46.594]  I think silver.
[02:15:47.574 --> 02:15:54.615]  I think every industrial metal and every commodity is going to go straight up, including oil, once we see these world currencies go down.
[02:15:54.655 --> 02:15:55.035]  What do you say?
[02:15:56.192 --> 02:16:05.640]  That's happening right now, because as part of the World War II agreement that was made at Brenton Woods, the World Reserve was based on the dollar, and all commodities are priced in dollars.
[02:16:05.680 --> 02:16:07.322]  You know, oil is all priced in dollars.
[02:16:07.382 --> 02:16:11.766]  If Japan wants to buy oil, they have to buy dollars first, and then use those dollars to buy oil.
[02:16:12.186 --> 02:16:17.391]  And that's part of what the global community is rebelling against, the dollar as a World Reserve currency, and they're breaking away.
[02:16:17.431 --> 02:16:19.733]  We see de-globalization happening.
[02:16:19.853 --> 02:16:23.537]  Right now countries are separating from the globalized community.
[02:16:23.617 --> 02:16:27.041]  And doesn't it seem like Joe Biden's policies are going to accelerate that?
[02:16:29.028 --> 02:16:36.414]  Look, Joe Biden has even, you know, I don't, I don't, I don't have any idea what's going on in Washington.
[02:16:36.454 --> 02:16:43.799]  I don't care because it doesn't, it does have, it's beyond the ability to have any, there's no comeback.
[02:16:43.919 --> 02:16:45.801]  We've gone through the event horizon.
[02:16:46.101 --> 02:16:46.501]  The U.S.
[02:16:46.541 --> 02:16:52.926]  economy is now entering a hyperinflationary collapse and Biden or whomever, it doesn't really matter.
[02:16:52.946 --> 02:16:53.787]  There's nothing he can do.
[02:16:54.527 --> 02:16:56.289]  We've gone over the... I totally agree with you.
[02:16:56.369 --> 02:16:57.089]  Gut level.
[02:16:57.129 --> 02:16:57.930]  My gut's always right.
[02:16:57.950 --> 02:16:58.951]  Intellectually, I agree, too.
[02:16:58.971 --> 02:17:02.033]  But gut level... I mean, I agree.
[02:17:02.093 --> 02:17:04.455]  We've passed the point of no return, event horizon.
[02:17:04.495 --> 02:17:06.577]  So what's going to happen?
[02:17:08.408 --> 02:17:13.072]  It's going to be like the antecedents you mentioned are correct.
[02:17:13.132 --> 02:17:15.634]  Weimar, Zimbabwe.
[02:17:16.635 --> 02:17:20.518]  We're going to have a major financial collapse.
[02:17:20.598 --> 02:17:21.959]  I mean, that's what we're going to have.
[02:17:22.079 --> 02:17:23.480]  And that's what's going to happen in 2021.
[02:17:23.520 --> 02:17:30.686]  And so what's the point of like General Ida Ray saying we're going to round up the gun owners and they've got 30,000 troops in D.C.?
[02:17:30.706 --> 02:17:36.731]  It all seems like pathetic people acting like they're powerful because 30,000 troops will do nothing when their families are starving to death.
[02:17:39.449 --> 02:17:43.913]  You know, the Pentagon, let me ask you a pop quiz, Alex Jones.
[02:17:43.953 --> 02:17:47.696]  How much does the Pentagon spend every single day to gas up their vehicles?
[02:17:48.216 --> 02:17:50.758]  The jets, the tanks, the infrastructure?
[02:17:50.778 --> 02:17:53.361]  I know their budget every year is about $800 billion.
[02:17:54.441 --> 02:17:58.305]  The budget every year is closer to $1.3, $1.4 trillion.
[02:17:58.485 --> 02:18:01.968]  Guess how much they spend every single day just to fill up the tanks and the jets?
[02:18:02.188 --> 02:18:02.488]  How much?
[02:18:02.808 --> 02:18:03.229]  And gas.
[02:18:04.411 --> 02:18:05.972]  I don't know.
[02:18:06.272 --> 02:18:11.876]  $250 million every day to just keep the Pentagon's war machine gassed up.
[02:18:12.556 --> 02:18:16.358]  Now, the fact is price of oil is going to go ballistic on the upside.
[02:18:16.659 --> 02:18:20.161]  The Pentagon, like the Roman Empire, will literally run out of money.
[02:18:20.361 --> 02:18:21.441]  That's the U.S.
[02:18:21.502 --> 02:18:22.302]  is too extended.
[02:18:22.622 --> 02:18:24.183]  They've got too many military bases.
[02:18:24.283 --> 02:18:25.464]  It's over militarized.
[02:18:25.944 --> 02:18:27.645]  And they literally won't be able to fill up.
[02:18:27.845 --> 02:18:30.347]  And you notice Trump tried to get the troops back and tried to.
[02:18:30.687 --> 02:18:31.768]  But no, we didn't want that, did we?
[02:18:33.246 --> 02:18:36.348]  Trump was anti-war, and that's why he got the boot.
[02:18:39.031 --> 02:18:40.652]  Wow, so how does this end, Kaiser?
[02:18:40.672 --> 02:18:41.292]  What's coming next?
[02:18:42.193 --> 02:18:43.994]  The current administration is pro-war.
[02:18:44.735 --> 02:18:48.358]  They started three wars already in the first few months of the administration.
[02:18:49.150 --> 02:18:51.671]  Because war is the most profitable business you can be in.
[02:18:52.031 --> 02:18:53.132]  Same thing with the prison business.
[02:18:53.592 --> 02:18:54.953]  And it takes the least amount of work.
[02:18:54.973 --> 02:19:00.195]  You just have to drop a bomb on somebody, and then wait for them to drop a bomb on you, and then drop five more.
[02:19:00.736 --> 02:19:01.316]  So that's it.
[02:19:01.376 --> 02:19:02.636]  That's the whole foreign policy.
[02:19:02.656 --> 02:19:07.038]  And then they drop 20 and you drop 50, and then they drop 100 and you drop 200.
[02:19:07.299 --> 02:19:08.259]  And you know, the U.S.
[02:19:08.779 --> 02:19:12.081]  has picked really soft targets over the past 30 years, like Iraq.
[02:19:12.768 --> 02:19:16.849]  You know, Afghanistan, you know, they like to kill civilians where it's easy.
[02:19:17.189 --> 02:19:25.711]  But eventually what happens is you pick on somebody who fires back and, you know, and has got the capabilities to go to actual, you know, cause some mischief.
[02:19:26.211 --> 02:19:28.852]  And then, you know, your costs suddenly skyrocket.
[02:19:28.972 --> 02:19:29.872]  Oh, and guess what?
[02:19:30.872 --> 02:19:35.013]  The commodities are also skyrocketing because we printed in the last 12 months.
[02:19:35.033 --> 02:19:36.653]  Max, you got to join us again this week.
[02:19:36.673 --> 02:19:37.133]  We love you.
[02:19:37.173 --> 02:19:37.874]  Max Keiser.
[02:19:38.214 --> 02:19:38.814]  Thank you so much.
[02:19:38.854 --> 02:19:39.474]  Join us again soon.
[02:19:40.947 --> 02:19:54.566]  Well, I really appreciate Joel Skousen, who I really respect, smart guy, joelskousen.com, editor of World Affairs Brief, worldaffairsbrief.com, for joining us for just two segments before Owen Troyer takes over with the War Room to give his take on
[02:19:55.834 --> 02:19:58.035]  This document, Department of Energy Order number 202-21-1.
[02:19:58.215 --> 02:20:04.916]  I got a call from family that works at a power plant as a manager on the weekend.
[02:20:05.016 --> 02:20:06.317]  I didn't even call them back until Monday.
[02:20:06.337 --> 02:20:07.577]  They're like, hey, you know, there's an order.
[02:20:07.597 --> 02:20:08.997]  We're not allowed to turn the power up.
[02:20:09.097 --> 02:20:11.218]  I just said, oh, my family says they can't turn the power up.
[02:20:11.658 --> 02:20:13.218]  Well, then we got sent this document.
[02:20:13.238 --> 02:20:14.399]  I went to the Department of Energy and read it.
[02:20:14.419 --> 02:20:17.979]  I got mad at myself this morning because I was being told by family how big this was.
[02:20:18.019 --> 02:20:19.000]  And here was the smoking gun.
[02:20:19.260 --> 02:20:20.280]  They're blaming Texas.
[02:20:20.300 --> 02:20:21.340]  They're blaming our grid.
[02:20:21.980 --> 02:20:23.741]  I'm blaming the windmills, which were part of it.
[02:20:24.964 --> 02:20:27.066]  And here it is, the big smoking gun.
[02:20:27.146 --> 02:20:28.767]  What is this really all about?
[02:20:28.807 --> 02:20:29.908]  I've got a good idea.
[02:20:30.368 --> 02:20:32.669]  They're already telling us, federalize the Texas grid.
[02:20:33.850 --> 02:20:40.895]  They charge up to 18,000 percent, not 10,000 percent more for outside power, which this document says you got to get it from there first.
[02:20:41.535 --> 02:20:43.077]  So Joel Skousen studied this.
[02:20:43.437 --> 02:20:49.401]  Here we are to talk about this, to talk about Biden, to just talk about the whole waterfront in two short segments.
[02:20:49.421 --> 02:20:51.182]  Joel Skousen, thanks for coming on with us.
[02:20:51.202 --> 02:20:52.143]  What do you want to tackle first?
[02:20:53.632 --> 02:20:55.433]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[02:20:55.593 --> 02:20:59.954]  It's important to understand where the blame lies in the Texas grid situation.
[02:21:00.514 --> 02:21:01.374]  It's twofold.
[02:21:01.834 --> 02:21:09.017]  In the first place, the Texas grid situation at best is running with just a little bit of excess power capacity.
[02:21:09.577 --> 02:21:17.799]  And so it doesn't take much of an overload in order to bring down the grid where they have to go to reserve power resources, which are all fossil fuel.
[02:21:18.439 --> 02:21:23.321]  And the problem with the federal order to the Texas grid was that you shall not turn up your
[02:21:24.196 --> 02:21:26.077]  Thank you for having me.
[02:21:48.562 --> 02:21:53.424]  Well, you know, you have a lot of radicals up in the federal bureaucracy of energy that are just extreme climatologists.
[02:22:14.773 --> 02:22:16.674]  We really believe in this global warning stuff.
[02:22:16.714 --> 02:22:25.038]  And they're, you know, talking, we will not put more sulfur dioxide in the air, even though these power plants are essentially clean now, as clean as you're going to get.
[02:22:25.939 --> 02:22:31.302]  And so it was really a very extremist group of bureaucrats, which did this.
[02:22:31.322 --> 02:22:33.343]  And I don't know if it was purposeful or not.
[02:22:33.783 --> 02:22:39.006]  But I can tell you that when you the reason why the grid came cascading down,
[02:22:39.614 --> 02:22:47.601]  Is because when you get up to maximum capacity, you're one or two seconds away from those generators shutting down automatically.
[02:22:47.621 --> 02:22:49.322]  And so they started the rolling blackouts.
[02:22:49.382 --> 02:22:59.691]  The problem with the rolling blackouts, they shut down power to the gas pumping stations so that there was a lack of natural gas to run existing power plants.
[02:22:59.751 --> 02:23:04.555]  So there is mismanagement and they didn't even know with models what to leave on, what to leave off.
[02:23:04.575 --> 02:23:07.137]  They actually shut down energy producing systems.
[02:23:08.140 --> 02:23:08.600]  That's right.
[02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:11.702]  Now they did have some idea, for example, of hospitals.
[02:23:12.262 --> 02:23:18.705]  My son lives in Dallas and he said that his electricity stayed on the whole time because they're only a few blocks away from the hospital.
[02:23:19.105 --> 02:23:23.367]  So their particular block of energy was kept on because of the hospital.
[02:23:23.407 --> 02:23:25.168]  Same thing with Steven Crowder up in Dallas.
[02:23:26.149 --> 02:23:26.329]  Yeah.
[02:23:27.349 --> 02:23:28.730]  So there was a lot of mismanagement.
[02:23:28.770 --> 02:23:36.734]  Of course, the mainstream media is making a big deal out of the fact that, oh, you can't blame solar or wind power for this because, you know, they're such a small percentage.
[02:23:37.332 --> 02:23:49.079]  Well, the problem with solar and wind power is that because they are susceptible to lack of wind, and when it's nighttime, the solar isn't producing at all, you've got to turn back on those thermal generating power plants.
[02:23:49.840 --> 02:23:54.363]  And when they didn't turn those back on in time, then they couldn't once they got frozen out.
[02:23:54.423 --> 02:23:56.664]  Because as I say, those power plants are out in the open.
[02:23:57.385 --> 02:23:59.206]  Well, it's usually not a problem with Texas.
[02:23:59.246 --> 02:24:02.428]  You don't usually have that much cold weather, but this was a severe event.
[02:24:03.146 --> 02:24:08.450]  And frankly, the entire establishment was unprepared for this, as well as, I will say, the people.
[02:24:08.510 --> 02:24:10.292]  And it's been a real wake-up call to people.
[02:24:10.832 --> 02:24:12.914]  No, no, I agree with you that it shows incompetence.
[02:24:12.934 --> 02:24:22.301]  But at the same time, you have the governor and others days before begging for them to override the order, which shows the federal government was in control of the energy policy.
[02:24:22.662 --> 02:24:27.786]  So instead of them blaming Texas, it needs to go back to who shut down the power plants under Obama.
[02:24:28.306 --> 02:24:30.969]  Who set us up in this position?
[02:24:31.009 --> 02:24:33.271]  Because they want to set themselves up as the saviors.
[02:24:33.691 --> 02:24:35.493]  I think it's important, Joel, do you agree with me?
[02:24:35.513 --> 02:24:43.921]  The evidence shows that it was federal mismanagement and control with ERCOD removing the state from the process that took one of our best powered systems and made it one of our worst.
[02:24:45.265 --> 02:24:46.927]  No, I completely agree with you, Alex.
[02:24:46.987 --> 02:24:49.530]  It was the federal problem, the federal edicts.
[02:24:49.570 --> 02:24:55.517]  But I would have said that Governor Abbott should have, in his State of the Department, overridden the federal orders to them.
[02:24:55.738 --> 02:24:58.501]  And he, if he even knew about it, I'm not sure he got briefed about it.
[02:24:58.521 --> 02:24:58.941]  No, I totally agree.
[02:24:58.981 --> 02:24:59.843]  I said that first hour.
[02:24:59.883 --> 02:25:00.764]  He should have overridden this.
[02:25:01.704 --> 02:25:02.084]  That's right.
[02:25:02.565 --> 02:25:07.788]  In a state of emergency, he should have said, you will not abide by the federal guidelines on emissions.
[02:25:07.828 --> 02:25:10.250]  You will turn on those power plants and keep them running.
[02:25:10.710 --> 02:25:12.291]  So he deserves some of the blame as well.
[02:25:13.032 --> 02:25:13.492]  I agree.
[02:25:13.532 --> 02:25:16.254]  Well, he got an award the week before from the big windmill people.
[02:25:16.274 --> 02:25:19.356]  Why don't you explain, you're an expert on this, what green energy is really about.
[02:25:21.317 --> 02:25:23.618]  Well, of course, it's a political thing.
[02:25:23.638 --> 02:25:26.259]  You know, green energy is more expensive energy.
[02:25:26.799 --> 02:25:32.222]  Wind and solar power do never compare in terms of the kilowatt power of nuclear power, for example.
[02:25:32.742 --> 02:25:36.163]  And they can't compare by at least half to fossil fuel.
[02:25:36.223 --> 02:25:40.745]  It's not really fossil fuel, but thermal energy from carbon sources.
[02:25:41.886 --> 02:25:42.246]  And so
[02:25:43.545 --> 02:25:57.988]  You know, Germany, for example, which was completely reliant on solar and wind power, has had some devastating blackouts because of conditions when the so-called green energy doesn't produce.
[02:25:58.675 --> 02:25:59.835]  So, it's a real problem.
[02:26:00.616 --> 02:26:03.517]  You know, you have many of these wind plants.
[02:26:03.897 --> 02:26:06.878]  The machinery inside could not handle the low temperatures.
[02:26:06.958 --> 02:26:08.378]  They needed heaters inside.
[02:26:08.398 --> 02:26:13.380]  The producers of the generators refused to put those heaters in because they're hardly ever used.
[02:26:13.840 --> 02:26:16.121]  They refused to put buildings around the generating plants.
[02:26:16.461 --> 02:26:27.405]  Now, solar will produce, let's say, during the day, even if it snows, the snow will generally melt off unless you're in sub-sub-zero temperature like we're having now, and it doesn't melt off the solar, and so it becomes
[02:26:28.266 --> 02:26:28.766]  In effect.
[02:26:29.026 --> 02:26:30.788]  There's no way about it Alex.
[02:26:30.808 --> 02:26:33.171]  We're never going to get along with just green energy.
[02:26:33.291 --> 02:26:36.794]  It's always going to require thermal energy as the main power backup.
[02:26:36.814 --> 02:26:38.055]  There's just not enough green energy.
[02:26:38.095 --> 02:26:38.756]  That's right.
[02:26:38.776 --> 02:26:39.637]  You explained that.
[02:26:40.538 --> 02:26:43.421]  My family is not a big oil family, but my mom's side of the family had
[02:26:43.581 --> 02:26:44.882]  Well, I'm afraid I have to get theological here.
[02:26:44.902 --> 02:26:46.963]  This was part of the creation of the earth.
[02:27:10.137 --> 02:27:10.437]  We're
[02:27:26.531 --> 02:27:29.913]  A tiny fraction of the decaying bodies of any dinosaurs.
[02:27:30.313 --> 02:27:35.997]  You would have had to have dinosaurs a hundred feet deep all over the entire earth to produce oil.
[02:27:36.017 --> 02:27:37.758]  And then how do you explain that it gets down deep?
[02:27:37.778 --> 02:27:38.998]  Well, it does seem like God's plan.
[02:27:39.038 --> 02:27:45.022]  And then now we're getting in a carbon starved area, then we find this, then we bring it back up, and we're like terraforming our own planet again.
[02:27:45.082 --> 02:27:47.984]  So it seems like it was intelligently designed.
[02:27:49.224 --> 02:27:49.725]  Exactly.
[02:27:49.885 --> 02:27:51.106]  Intelligently designed.
[02:27:51.166 --> 02:27:53.507]  And I, I'm, you know, I'm not
[02:27:56.135 --> 02:28:00.576]  Because, you know, a lot of the fossils we find of those actually lived on the Earth.
[02:28:01.056 --> 02:28:08.317]  It's very, very possible this Earth was created by layers from other previous planets where these things are previously grown and put together.
[02:28:09.418 --> 02:28:20.280]  You know, when you look at the chance of this orbit of this Earth being so perfectly designed in the tilt of the Earth to have the perfect seasons... And the Moon is in the perfect spot!
[02:28:21.081 --> 02:28:23.802]  And the moon is in the perfect distance from the sun.
[02:28:23.862 --> 02:28:26.943]  There's just no way that these things could happen by chance.
[02:28:27.003 --> 02:28:30.224]  This Earth was a divine creation.
[02:28:31.004 --> 02:28:40.147]  And, you know, most Christians believe in, and they should all believe, in the fact that the Lord has power over the elements.
[02:28:40.227 --> 02:28:42.928]  Meaning the elements are intelligent enough to obey commands.
[02:28:45.527 --> 02:28:50.071]  And it isn't natural law that Moses smote the rock and water poured out.
[02:28:50.111 --> 02:28:52.373]  It wasn't that he cracked it in a natural spring.
[02:28:52.874 --> 02:28:58.458]  You know, the Lord can command that elements reform and form any element necessary.
[02:28:58.559 --> 02:29:02.502]  Because God is in command of everything created, and we're made in the small image of God.
[02:29:02.782 --> 02:29:03.563]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:03.863 --> 02:29:06.926]  We'll stay on the other side with a final segment with Joel Skousen.
[02:29:08.087 --> 02:29:09.708]  All right, this is only an 11-minute segment.
[02:29:11.420 --> 02:29:14.841]  Owen Schroyer takes over three hours, and I can talk to Joel Skousen for five hours.
[02:29:14.981 --> 02:29:15.622]  Really smart guy.
[02:29:15.642 --> 02:29:18.323]  So I want to pick his brain about a few final issues here.
[02:29:20.103 --> 02:29:29.987]  Well, just minutes ago during the break, Joe Biden is at the Pfizer plant, who is the main group with this mRNA gene therapy.
[02:29:30.067 --> 02:29:30.848]  It's not a vaccine.
[02:29:31.968 --> 02:29:34.909]  As our savior, saying we'll open up once everyone's taking the shot.
[02:29:35.330 --> 02:29:38.371]  Now they're telling pregnant women you got to take it, even though the advisory says don't take it.
[02:29:39.331 --> 02:29:44.816]  We've got Merck pulling out of the vaccine program with Pfizer, saying it just doesn't work.
[02:29:44.896 --> 02:29:45.616]  That was a month ago.
[02:29:45.676 --> 02:29:48.058]  We have South Africa pulling out of the vaccine.
[02:29:48.098 --> 02:29:50.760]  We have Australia pulling out of their national vaccine.
[02:29:51.601 --> 02:29:53.802]  We have India saying no to Pfizer.
[02:29:54.303 --> 02:29:55.844]  I had a big article written last week.
[02:29:55.904 --> 02:30:01.588]  It trended on Twitter, and Bill Gates wrote a big article countering me that was in hundreds of publications.
[02:30:01.608 --> 02:30:07.373]  I had 7,000 Google alerts the other day on this, so that's how many places it was, but it was mainly just republished everywhere.
[02:30:09.755 --> 02:30:10.896]  We're good to go.
[02:30:30.111 --> 02:30:31.332]  Yes, scroll down and show viewers.
[02:30:31.392 --> 02:30:39.655]  So, they later removed that, so as God would have it, they even put that Bill Gates was paying for the Newsweek article that then got put in a bunch of other publications.
[02:30:39.675 --> 02:30:40.736]  Yes, scroll down for TV viewers.
[02:30:41.616 --> 02:30:42.556]  Scroll faster, I want to show them.
[02:30:42.936 --> 02:30:48.619]  Because down there at the bottom, I got a screenshot knowing they'd remove it, and sure enough... Yeah, keep scrolling guys, please.
[02:30:50.589 --> 02:30:51.349]  Just keep going to the bottom.
[02:30:51.569 --> 02:30:51.950]  There it is.
[02:30:52.750 --> 02:30:57.412]  Microsoft and partners may be compensated if you purchase something through recommended links.
[02:30:57.852 --> 02:31:01.374]  They changed that to a NewsGuard link admitting it's owned by Bill Gates.
[02:31:01.454 --> 02:31:03.215]  So, we got nine minutes left.
[02:31:03.235 --> 02:31:06.877]  I want to try to give you the floor, but what's really going on with this so-called vaccine?
[02:31:06.917 --> 02:31:10.338]  And why are so many countries pulling out, but we're told don't worry about it?
[02:31:10.739 --> 02:31:13.420]  Why'd the British government say over 75 shouldn't take it?
[02:31:13.920 --> 02:31:16.142]  But if you try to talk about it, Mark Zuckerberg blocks you.
[02:31:16.482 --> 02:31:19.024]  Zuckerberg leaks a video where he said he doesn't trust it.
[02:31:19.404 --> 02:31:20.825]  What's going on here, Joel Skousen?
[02:31:22.566 --> 02:31:29.351]  Well, it is one of the largest conspiracies that's ever come upon the world is the so-called effectiveness of vaccines.
[02:31:29.411 --> 02:31:37.757]  Vaccines, you know, technically can work under very limited circumstances, but you can never create, as Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[02:31:37.797 --> 02:31:40.159]  said, you can never mass produce a safe vaccine.
[02:31:40.819 --> 02:31:48.861]  Because of all of the adjuvants and the preservatives in there to keep the so-called reactions down, you just can never produce a safe vaccine.
[02:31:49.262 --> 02:31:54.523]  And of course, why would they have to cover up for the autism link between the MMR and other vaccines?
[02:31:55.023 --> 02:32:05.626]  Why would they have to cover up for the apoplectic shock problem with major vaccines that's happening even with this DNA, you know, gene therapy, if in fact it were safe?
[02:32:05.686 --> 02:32:07.727]  In fact, that's the biggest lie that's ever been told.
[02:32:08.100 --> 02:32:09.941]  But here's the bottom line on vaccines.
[02:32:10.261 --> 02:32:12.603]  They cannot produce a vaccine for a virus.
[02:32:12.723 --> 02:32:14.945]  The virus continually mutates.
[02:32:14.965 --> 02:32:16.045]  The target keeps moving.
[02:32:16.606 --> 02:32:23.570]  Even Bill Gates came out and said this week, you're going to require the third vaccine or the third shot from this to be effective.
[02:32:23.891 --> 02:32:26.712]  They can keep doing this forever, just like the flu shot every year.
[02:32:27.533 --> 02:32:30.455]  And everyone who takes the flu shot knows it really doesn't work.
[02:32:32.359 --> 02:32:35.600]  It makes your immune system more vulnerable to disease.
[02:32:35.660 --> 02:32:49.866]  That's one of the biggest problems with the side effects of the mRNA so-called vaccine, which isn't a real vaccine, is it causes a hypersensitivity of your immune system to the real virus if you catch it later on.
[02:32:50.286 --> 02:32:56.689]  That's why they bypassed animal trials in this so that they didn't have to show that there would be a hypersensitivity to
[02:32:57.749 --> 02:33:00.250]  That's another thing I forgot to mention yesterday.
[02:33:00.290 --> 02:33:00.930]  My show ended.
[02:33:00.970 --> 02:33:02.131]  Even NBC News has doctors saying
[02:33:14.895 --> 02:33:25.119]  If you're a woman, don't get a mammogram or a checkup because for six months the mRNA will make you look like you have tumors in your ovaries and in your uterus.
[02:33:25.239 --> 02:33:29.921]  What is, I mean, like don't get a cancer screening because it'll look like you have cancer?
[02:33:29.961 --> 02:33:30.641]  What is that?
[02:33:33.124 --> 02:33:37.307]  Well, you know, what's interesting is that, you know, they never admit that the vaccine is the blame.
[02:33:37.327 --> 02:33:42.750]  There was a major doctor on television who was bragging about taking the vaccine to protect her newborn child.
[02:33:43.191 --> 02:33:47.073]  And then she aborted the child, or it was miscarried.
[02:33:47.133 --> 02:33:47.754]  And the baby died.
[02:33:49.155 --> 02:33:51.697]  And the baby died, you know, all to protect her child.
[02:33:51.737 --> 02:33:59.362]  But of course, it's very, very difficult to trace any of these severe reactions to disease, just like it's hard to trace the
[02:34:00.249 --> 02:34:03.412]  The side effects of the various drugs that they approve.
[02:34:03.732 --> 02:34:07.796]  And that's why they put hundreds of side effects on there because they can't prove anything.
[02:34:08.316 --> 02:34:13.780]  It just takes tremendous difficulty because it reacts with your body depending on what you're doing.
[02:34:13.840 --> 02:34:14.581]  If you've got bad nutrition.
[02:34:14.681 --> 02:34:19.925]  I mean, when somebody dies of their liver failing from drinking too much, they don't usually put alcoholism on the death certificate.
[02:34:19.946 --> 02:34:20.766]  They say liver failure.
[02:34:21.126 --> 02:34:21.867]  So it's the same thing.
[02:34:21.907 --> 02:34:23.488]  Like, well, we don't know what made your kid autistic.
[02:34:23.729 --> 02:34:25.630]  We don't know why you just had your baby die.
[02:34:25.650 --> 02:34:28.833]  But we know statistically these vaccines are causing major problems.
[02:34:30.472 --> 02:34:32.013]  Well, it's a very serious problem.
[02:34:32.033 --> 02:34:36.736]  The people I know listening to your show and reading my World Affairs Brief will not take the vaccine.
[02:34:37.137 --> 02:34:38.678]  But there's going to be increasing pressure.
[02:34:38.698 --> 02:34:43.561]  They keep talking about, of course, mandating the vaccine passport to get around.
[02:34:44.121 --> 02:34:45.142]  Israel's doing it.
[02:34:45.242 --> 02:34:50.285]  Israel's trailblazing, saying you can't go to the movies, the mall, inside a building unless you have this pass.
[02:34:52.489 --> 02:35:08.032]  Well, look, Israel gave a million dollar prize to Dr. Fauci this past week for defending science, quote, against unopposed or unauthorized objections, you know, and it's only the people who are opposing these vaccines that have the real science.
[02:35:08.252 --> 02:35:18.554]  It's the Dr. Fauci who clearly doesn't need another million dollars because he's gaining millions from the patents he's got on coronavirus and all of the other skullduggery that he's been involved in.
[02:35:19.236 --> 02:35:25.759]  But, you know, to give that person a million dollar prize tells me that the Israel government is part of the deep state and always has been.
[02:35:26.059 --> 02:35:26.820]  Well, I agree.
[02:35:26.860 --> 02:35:32.362]  They're like rounding up and like SWAT teaming Hasidic Jews because they go outside.
[02:35:32.423 --> 02:35:34.343]  I mean, that's what Hitler was doing.
[02:35:34.383 --> 02:35:35.604]  What's going on there?
[02:35:37.125 --> 02:35:41.367]  Well, it's accustoming people to being living under emergency orders permanently.
[02:35:42.202 --> 02:35:49.444]  And what I'd like to talk about in just the last few minutes that we have that I covered in the World Affairs Briefs this Friday.
[02:35:49.464 --> 02:35:57.466]  And by the way, any listeners can get a free copy of this simply by going to the website worldaffairsbrief.com and on the left, click on Request a Sample.
[02:35:57.966 --> 02:35:58.746]  And it's invaluable.
[02:35:59.146 --> 02:36:00.166]  Your stuff's the best there is.
[02:36:00.206 --> 02:36:01.707]  So people get a free copy.
[02:36:01.727 --> 02:36:02.627]  Tell them how to do it again.
[02:36:04.502 --> 02:36:07.944]  If you can see on the screen there on the left hand side it says request a sample.
[02:36:08.124 --> 02:36:09.504]  That's where you get your sample.
[02:36:09.885 --> 02:36:17.128]  Whenever I was usually on your show, Alex, I would tell people to email me to a sample and I'd get three or four or five hundred requests.
[02:36:17.168 --> 02:36:19.389]  It would take me all day to send out the sample.
[02:36:19.429 --> 02:36:20.709]  So it's automated now.
[02:36:20.729 --> 02:36:24.571]  Sure, so in the three minutes we got left, you can come back Sunday if you have time, but tell them the other big story.
[02:36:25.475 --> 02:36:41.708]  The big story is that the Mike Lindell, he's very sincere, he's a good patriot, but his video, Absolute Proof, has several pieces of major disinformation that he's received that is going to get us discredited or make trouble for him when he goes to the court.
[02:36:41.728 --> 02:36:43.369]  I agree, it's meant to spike all the good info.
[02:36:44.230 --> 02:36:49.835]  That's right, and it's to destroy the good, and part of it is the Mary Fanning stuff at the end of the video.
[02:36:49.895 --> 02:36:55.079]  It's a two hour long video, but she produces a screenshot from an anonymous source
[02:36:55.606 --> 02:36:55.866]  Okay.
[02:37:27.787 --> 02:37:37.951]  The point I make in the brief is that nobody except the NSA has access to monitor every email, every hacker that goes into every county.
[02:37:38.071 --> 02:37:42.072]  No private whistleblower, anybody has that capability.
[02:37:42.132 --> 02:37:43.893]  And I'll tell you, the NSA is deep state.
[02:37:43.933 --> 02:37:46.634]  They aren't going to be providing true information.
[02:37:47.290 --> 02:37:56.058]  The point is, by feeding the foreign interference false narrative to Mike Lindell, they're shielding the deep state who did all of this.
[02:37:56.078 --> 02:37:58.721]  Which was done with ballots at the point through the computer.
[02:37:59.481 --> 02:37:59.962]  That's right.
[02:38:00.142 --> 02:38:01.823]  And China could not have done that.
[02:38:02.464 --> 02:38:04.146]  China could have hacked in, but they didn't.
[02:38:04.206 --> 02:38:09.551]  Why would the deep state use China to hack in when they in fact... No, they crammed the ballots at the point of access.
[02:38:10.441 --> 02:38:10.841]  That's right.
[02:38:11.082 --> 02:38:16.206]  And so, you know, our patriots have to wake up to this bogus information.
[02:38:16.246 --> 02:38:19.769]  If anybody contacts you, I'm an insider and I'm going to feed you information.
[02:38:19.789 --> 02:38:20.209]  That's right.
[02:38:20.229 --> 02:38:21.991]  We're not trying to police everybody, folks.
[02:38:22.011 --> 02:38:22.591]  We've been doing this.
[02:38:22.611 --> 02:38:23.592]  You've been doing it 50 years.
[02:38:23.652 --> 02:38:25.133]  I've been doing it 27.
[02:38:25.173 --> 02:38:26.314]  We've learned this, folks.
[02:38:26.655 --> 02:38:29.217]  Do not go with anonymous or magic bullet people.
[02:38:29.317 --> 02:38:30.238]  It doesn't exist.
[02:38:31.846 --> 02:38:34.088]  If it's too good to be true, it usually is.
[02:38:34.108 --> 02:38:35.170]  That's the problem.
[02:38:54.858 --> 02:38:55.278]  That's right.
[02:38:55.338 --> 02:39:00.900]  And it's important to realize, you know, how they do this, but you have to understand how the deep state operates.
[02:39:00.920 --> 02:39:04.501]  You have to understand that the NSA controls every communication.
[02:39:04.541 --> 02:39:14.604]  There's no way any insider can talk to any of us on the conservative side and get away with it unless they are permitted to as disinformation people.
[02:39:14.664 --> 02:39:16.225]  And there are no military people.
[02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:21.144]  That are willing to save us because they're all vetted out of the military at the higher level.
[02:39:21.725 --> 02:39:23.146]  And we're not saying that to be negative, folks.
[02:39:23.186 --> 02:39:24.267]  We're just being honest.
[02:39:24.307 --> 02:39:25.328]  We have to get with God.
[02:39:25.709 --> 02:39:27.610]  We have to change things ourselves, our local communities.
[02:39:27.951 --> 02:39:29.072]  Joel Skousen, I totally agree with you.
[02:39:29.232 --> 02:39:30.994]  joelskousen.com, worldfirstbrief.com.
[02:39:31.274 --> 02:39:31.935]  Thank you so much.
[02:39:32.936 --> 02:39:33.736]  My pleasure, Alex.
[02:39:34.397 --> 02:39:35.798]  Come back next week if you want for a full hour.
[02:39:35.898 --> 02:39:37.961]  Okay, Owen Schroeder takes over in just a moment.
[02:39:37.981 --> 02:39:39.322]  Appreciate all the callers we didn't get to.
[02:39:39.882 --> 02:39:40.963]  I'll be back Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:39:46.758 --> 02:39:47.939]  It's a little apocalyptic.
[02:39:47.959 --> 02:39:51.744]  I'm telling you, this is my Patriot Supply from preparewithalex.com.
[02:39:51.804 --> 02:39:53.126]  It's so good, I'm in here trying to get some more.
[02:39:53.146 --> 02:39:54.948]  Zimmerman's been working 20 hours a day.
[02:39:54.968 --> 02:39:57.130]  One of the most avid players here.
[02:39:58.280 --> 02:39:59.101]  Trying to feed people.
[02:39:59.121 --> 02:40:01.424]  Because the power's off for most of our crew members.
[02:40:02.705 --> 02:40:03.806]  And because we're not essential.
[02:40:04.747 --> 02:40:08.652]  And the grocery stores are all basically closed to the few essential ones.
[02:40:08.672 --> 02:40:11.855]  Because they just decide whose grocery store can be essential, who isn't.
[02:40:11.875 --> 02:40:13.697]  This is the new planned economy.
[02:40:14.238 --> 02:40:18.263]  So now it's not just the big banks that get in on it and big tech that doubles all its profits under the lockdown.
[02:40:19.417 --> 02:40:23.419]  Now all the local groups that are essential get to get in on the fun as well.
[02:40:23.819 --> 02:40:26.500]  And then they decide, your restaurant's closed, yours is open.
[02:40:27.141 --> 02:40:28.962]  Your hospital's closed, yours is open.
[02:40:29.242 --> 02:40:30.542]  It's all very technocratic.
[02:40:30.582 --> 02:40:31.543]  It's all done by computer.
[02:40:31.783 --> 02:40:33.024]  It's all liberal.
[02:40:33.444 --> 02:40:34.904]  Preparewithalex.com.
[02:40:36.565 --> 02:40:37.446]  I call this horrible food.
[02:40:37.466 --> 02:40:38.286]  Well, you still can.
[02:40:38.746 --> 02:40:40.487]  And it's ready to ship out from the warehouse in Utah.
[02:40:40.507 --> 02:40:41.388]  Preparewithalex.com.
[02:40:41.488 --> 02:40:42.508]  And it's for the broadcast.
[02:40:42.588 --> 02:40:43.689]  You don't want to be on air.
[02:40:46.181 --> 02:40:50.303]  The need for storable foods are increasingly apparent.
[02:40:51.303 --> 02:41:00.168]  With millions left without power, including most grocery stores, many Texas residents are left without food.
[02:41:01.607 --> 02:41:08.709]  The lines at the grocery stores are getting longer and longer, while most of the store shelves are left bare.
[02:41:09.849 --> 02:41:22.993]  Now we know that in the most historic record freezing temperatures in over a century, your government can simply turn off the power, turn off the heat, and turn off the water.
[02:41:24.727 --> 02:41:29.388]  Don't let your government dictate whether or not you're able to feed your family.
[02:41:30.109 --> 02:41:40.092]  Go to infowarrestore.com and get at least a year's supply of storable foods to make sure you and your family are prepared for the unimaginable.
[02:41:41.152 --> 02:41:43.593]  Get your storable foods at infowarrestore.com.
[02:41:49.943 --> 02:41:52.224]  We're not gonna be on the air unless we have your support.
[02:41:52.284 --> 02:41:55.586]  Plus, we've got great products that everybody already needs.
[02:41:55.826 --> 02:41:57.167]  It's been sold out for a while.
[02:41:57.707 --> 02:42:02.310]  It's the highest quality vitamin D3 and vitamin K for your immunity and for your body's defenses.
[02:42:03.430 --> 02:42:06.612]  It's something that's essential that everyone needs regardless.
[02:42:06.772 --> 02:42:09.154]  The globalists don't want you knowing how to protect yourself.
[02:42:09.234 --> 02:42:10.394]  A limited supply.
[02:42:10.514 --> 02:42:11.655]  A limited supply.
[02:42:11.735 --> 02:42:13.556]  Because they can't get the bottles or the caps.
[02:42:13.796 --> 02:42:15.037]  They just changed the packaging.
[02:42:15.117 --> 02:42:15.797]  Has come in.
[02:42:15.817 --> 02:42:18.279]  It'll probably be sold out in a week at the amount we have.
[02:42:18.359 --> 02:42:19.019]  Despite that, it's
[02:42:19.099 --> 02:42:19.439]  That's right.
[02:42:40.618 --> 02:42:41.759]  Made by the same great lab.
[02:42:41.779 --> 02:42:43.179]  The highest end we can get.
[02:42:43.299 --> 02:42:44.020]  I'm so proud of it.
[02:42:44.160 --> 02:42:48.302]  Ultra 12 with it is 40% off in the combo pack.
[02:42:48.422 --> 02:42:51.624]  Get Ultra 12 by itself, because there's no shortage of that yet.
[02:42:51.844 --> 02:42:52.804]  For 50% off.
[02:42:52.824 --> 02:42:54.125]  Ultra 12, 50% off by itself.
[02:42:54.145 --> 02:42:55.445]  Winter Sun, 25% by itself.
[02:42:55.465 --> 02:42:56.126]  The two in a combo, 40%.
[02:42:58.967 --> 02:42:59.248]  98% off.
[02:42:59.368 --> 02:43:01.229]  No reviews on that, because it's a brand new combo.
[02:43:01.269 --> 02:43:05.172]  But look at the reviews of Ultra 12 and Winter Sun by itself.
[02:43:05.412 --> 02:43:05.172]  98, 99%.
[02:43:05.972 --> 02:43:07.714]  Thousands upon thousands of reviews.
[02:43:07.854 --> 02:43:11.676]  I can tell you this is made by the top lab in the country.
[02:43:11.696 --> 02:43:12.257]  4.9 stars.
[02:43:12.437 --> 02:43:13.318]  Limited supply.
[02:43:13.418 --> 02:43:22.104]  Separately, my dad, working with a major manufacturer, major developer, and a chemist, has launched his own line that we carry at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:43:22.164 --> 02:43:23.245]  And these are all different formulas.
[02:43:23.265 --> 02:43:25.647]  It doesn't compete with Supermelt Vitality or Alpha Power.
[02:43:25.667 --> 02:43:27.108]  It's just different and it's really strong.
[02:43:27.788 --> 02:43:30.811]  Total Male Invigoration Primal Youth.
[02:43:31.451 --> 02:43:38.818]  Available Primal Youth along with the Extra Strength Kava Gel from Dr. Jones Naturals at MFullWorthStore.com.
[02:43:38.838 --> 02:43:44.403]  That's MFullWorthStore.com or find that and other products at Dr. Jones Naturals, DrJonesNaturals.com.
[02:43:56.075 --> 02:43:57.296]  This is the American dream.
[02:43:57.736 --> 02:44:00.418]  Independent companies supplying the American people.
[02:44:00.458 --> 02:44:06.142]  Behind me is the 400,000 square foot facility for MyPatriotSupply, one of our biggest supporters.
[02:44:06.642 --> 02:44:08.523]  They have so many Americans working for them.
[02:44:08.824 --> 02:44:12.766]  The food, the products, it's all right here from America, right to your door.
[02:44:13.106 --> 02:44:16.208]  We're not funded by Bill Gates or George Soros, the globalist.
[02:44:16.228 --> 02:44:22.333]  We are funded by you supporting us at InfoWareStore.com with amazing American companies like MyPatriotSupply.
[02:44:26.275 --> 02:44:30.676]  And then they advertise and have a really high price, so they make a profit off that food.
[02:44:30.716 --> 02:44:32.357]  But they don't produce it themselves.
[02:44:32.857 --> 02:44:34.777]  They don't stockpile it fresh.
[02:44:35.357 --> 02:44:37.638]  Almost all of this is coming off the assembly line at what?
[02:44:37.658 --> 02:44:39.278]  Big ship out in a day or two?
[02:44:39.358 --> 02:44:39.939]  Absolutely.
[02:44:39.959 --> 02:44:42.799]  So this Gaylord right here is going to go back to our keating team.
[02:44:43.299 --> 02:44:45.500]  By tomorrow, these pouches are going to be inside of buckets.
[02:44:45.720 --> 02:44:47.580]  And the next day, those buckets are going to be out the door.
[02:44:47.901 --> 02:44:49.721]  So Joe, tell us what we're doing right here in the factory.
[02:44:49.841 --> 02:44:51.682]  So this is our shipping station right here, Alex.
[02:44:51.722 --> 02:44:55.164]  And this is actually InfoWars orders that are going out at this very moment.
[02:44:55.184 --> 02:44:57.245]  Like this order right here for Steven.
[02:44:57.265 --> 02:45:02.427]  Steven lives in California and he's going to get a special autographed pick ticket from Alex Jones.
[02:45:02.547 --> 02:45:03.968]  So I want to thank you for your support.
[02:45:03.988 --> 02:45:05.349]  Pleasure getting some great storable food.
[02:45:05.409 --> 02:45:06.490]  So I'm your Christmas elf.
[02:45:06.850 --> 02:45:08.971]  A little bit late in the year, but thank you so much for your support, brother.
[02:45:09.531 --> 02:45:13.594]  Yeah, we're shipping products, you know, hundreds of packages per day through our state-of-the-art conveyor system.
[02:45:14.034 --> 02:45:15.636]  This is really the state-of-the-art thing.
[02:45:15.656 --> 02:45:19.378]  I think Amazon is what's comparable to what we do here at MyPatriotSupply.
[02:45:19.759 --> 02:45:21.120]  This is Lynn from Alabama.
[02:45:21.160 --> 02:45:22.681]  Lynn ordered for Infowars.com.
[02:45:22.721 --> 02:45:23.982]  Her order is going out this afternoon.
[02:45:24.022 --> 02:45:26.304]  It's going to be on a truck here in the next couple of minutes.
[02:45:26.364 --> 02:45:27.504]  It's going to be on her way to Lynn.
[02:45:28.065 --> 02:45:29.346]  Lynn from Alabama, we love you.
[02:45:29.386 --> 02:45:30.166]  We appreciate you.
[02:45:30.186 --> 02:45:31.788]  You made the right choice with this affordable food.
[02:45:31.808 --> 02:45:33.189]  This is insurance you can eat.
[02:45:33.549 --> 02:45:34.990]  And when did they put this order in?
[02:45:35.010 --> 02:45:36.031]  I want to see how fast it's going out.
[02:45:36.377 --> 02:45:40.340]  You know, this order was actually put in, I think, two days ago, and it's already going out the door.
[02:45:40.360 --> 02:45:45.843]  So, two days ago, fresh food, produced, packaged, right here in America, the whole nine yards.
[02:45:45.903 --> 02:45:47.064]  This is the American dream.
[02:45:47.104 --> 02:45:53.548]  This is American capitalism bringing us exceptionalism, bringing us more choices, and we thank you for keeping us on the air.
[02:45:53.708 --> 02:45:54.349]  Thank you so much.
[02:45:55.369 --> 02:46:00.873]  I've ordered a lot of high-quality food from you guys over the years, but it just gets better and better tasting, and the selection is so huge.
[02:46:01.293 --> 02:46:02.454]  And I was just walking around in here.
[02:46:02.514 --> 02:46:05.536]  How many different variants and products do you have?
[02:46:06.752 --> 02:46:08.073]  We have hundreds of different products.
[02:46:08.153 --> 02:46:13.237]  And you know, when you're talking about food, I mean freeze-dried fruits, freeze-dried vegetables, freeze-dried meats, ready-made meals.
[02:46:13.317 --> 02:46:19.481]  Just the ready-made meals that we have, the ones that come inside of the four-week kit, there's going to be at least 18 different varieties that we offer.
[02:46:19.601 --> 02:46:23.785]  And we keep expanding that as we do more research, as we do more configurations.
[02:46:23.825 --> 02:46:25.126]  We're going to be adding different meals.
[02:46:25.266 --> 02:46:27.507]  Your food was great 12 years ago, but now it's amazing.
[02:46:27.547 --> 02:46:30.950]  Chicken noodle, vegetarian taco, potato, cheese.
[02:46:31.270 --> 02:46:33.352]  Easy broccoli rice, brown sugar oatmeal.
[02:46:33.432 --> 02:46:34.412]  Banana slices.
[02:46:35.453 --> 02:46:38.615]  Peanut butter, corn chowder, white rice, sugar.
[02:46:38.635 --> 02:46:41.377]  You've got wheat honey bread, whey milk.
[02:46:41.917 --> 02:46:44.078]  You'll have traveler stew, chicken noodle.
[02:46:44.118 --> 02:46:45.019]  Oh, I like traveler stew.
[02:46:45.219 --> 02:46:47.000]  Traveler stew is one of our more popular ones.
[02:46:47.020 --> 02:46:48.221]  Chicken noodle, it's excellent.
[02:46:48.501 --> 02:46:53.384]  Yep, I mean we have almost anything that you would eat on a regular basis packaged in the long-term food storage.
[02:46:53.424 --> 02:46:54.244]  They've got everything, folks.
[02:46:54.264 --> 02:46:56.005]  You've got to check it out at Infolarestore.com.
[02:46:56.225 --> 02:46:57.266]  The entire selection there.
[02:46:57.546 --> 02:47:01.410]  Literally, within a day or two of your order coming in, it's being shipped out to you.
[02:47:01.750 --> 02:47:04.593]  If it's local, in Utah, it's on those small trucks.
[02:47:04.993 --> 02:47:07.015]  If it's outside Utah, it's on big 18-wheelers.
[02:47:07.035 --> 02:47:11.680]  Again, that's why MyPatriot, with Ready Hour, has become the number one storeable food company in the world.
[02:47:11.900 --> 02:47:17.005]  Because of quality, because of service, because of reliability, and because of good word of mouth.
[02:47:17.185 --> 02:47:20.949]  So I want to thank you all for supporting us and supporting our great supplier, MyPatriot.
[02:47:32.913 --> 02:47:36.521]  Right here in America and it funds the InfoWars.
[02:47:36.561 --> 02:47:38.806]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com today and get prepared!
