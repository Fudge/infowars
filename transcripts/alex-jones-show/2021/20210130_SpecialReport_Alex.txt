[00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.691]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:23.272 --> 00:00:25.533]  Thank you for joining us on this Saturday evening.
[00:00:25.754 --> 00:00:32.176]  Every broadcast we engage in is very important and could be our last in these very troubled times here on planet Earth.
[00:00:32.777 --> 00:00:46.983]  I don't need to remind regular listeners of the fact that InfoWars chronicled basically everything that's unfolded in the last 27 years and in many cases not just years but decades before laid out specifically what was coming next and now
[00:00:49.113 --> 00:01:06.280]  Long-time listeners, long-time viewers, but even new viewers are discovering all of the tens of thousands of interviews that they've been unsuccessful scrubbing off the internet, where myself and our incredible guests and callers and activists chronicle what's really happening in the world.
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.501]  There's a lot of false ideologies out there and a lot of false systems.
[00:01:10.381 --> 00:01:17.244]  But my program, The Info War, is about researching the elite, what their plans are and how they interact with us.
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.641]  And what their endgame is and how to stop them.
[00:01:20.942 --> 00:01:29.569]  Now, I remember seeing this documentary about a week ago and thinking it was amazing and wanting to tell my producers to get Katherine Austin Fitz on.
[00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:32.571]  She worked at the highest levels of the HUD administration for the Clintons.
[00:01:34.853 --> 00:01:36.575]  When I saw it, it had over a million views.
[00:01:36.635 --> 00:01:45.422]  Well, it turns out it's been taken down dozens of times off of YouTube because she lays out how this is
[00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:48.680]  The planetary lockdown.
[00:01:49.921 --> 00:01:50.682]  Planet lockdown.
[00:01:51.222 --> 00:01:53.143]  I've actually called it myself a planetary lockdown.
[00:01:53.323 --> 00:01:54.684]  It's a global government lockdown.
[00:01:55.985 --> 00:02:04.111]  So, I'm going to air this documentary because the makers of it have asked people to share it and to post it on free sites.
[00:02:04.431 --> 00:02:12.237]  And we'll put a link here once the show isn't live at Band.Video to the documentary and a link to where you can check out the filmmakers and the great work they're doing.
[00:02:13.732 --> 00:02:16.194]  And I guarantee you trying to silence them is only going to backfire on them.
[00:02:16.214 --> 00:02:18.935]  But this is an admitted planetary takeover.
[00:02:20.616 --> 00:02:25.259]  And this lady managed tens of billions of dollars at HUD alone, some of the largest brokerage firms.
[00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.601]  And I definitely want her on about GameStop and this and more this week.
[00:02:30.502 --> 00:02:35.485]  But after I lay out the latest news, we are going to air it here for all these radio and TV affiliates.
[00:02:35.545 --> 00:02:37.026]  We're going basically commercial free.
[00:02:37.086 --> 00:02:39.968]  We'll have a few breaks for stations, but I'm not gonna be running any ads till the end of the show.
[00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.802]  And we're going to then also archive this full film at Band.Video.
[00:02:47.042 --> 00:02:56.328]  That's why we built Band.Video, but it'll also be archived in this live feed today once that is, once that is over, once that is completed.
[00:02:57.308 --> 00:03:07.615]  But it's very, very important because they are training you to incrementally lose more and more of your rights and then not resist it, believing that at some point they're going to take the restrictions off.
[00:03:08.035 --> 00:03:10.917]  Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates,
[00:03:12.691 --> 00:03:17.232]  Tony Blair, all these New World Order people have said publicly, it never ends.
[00:03:18.312 --> 00:03:31.335]  And Klaus Schwab this week at the Deimos Group said, and there's a video posted on Bandot Video in the Gregory section where he actually says it, that businesses and jobs where you are in human contact are over, will never reopen.
[00:03:32.995 --> 00:03:36.156]  I mean, these are the most dictatorial, insane,
[00:03:37.987 --> 00:03:41.190]  Science fiction-esque stuff the world has ever imagined.
[00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:42.811]  This video went up a few days ago.
[00:03:42.871 --> 00:03:43.652]  It needs to go viral.
[00:03:43.732 --> 00:03:47.555]  America being destroyed from within the Great Reset.
[00:03:49.336 --> 00:03:51.058]  But that's why Band-Odd video is so precious.
[00:03:51.078 --> 00:03:52.279]  That's why you are so precious.
[00:03:52.319 --> 00:04:02.066]  It's why I'm begging you, for the sake of your children and my children, and not our future, our current state, to say no to the lockdowns, to say no to the masks.
[00:04:02.126 --> 00:04:04.328]  I mean, now they're saying wear five masks, ten masks.
[00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:06.190]  It's always about stand on your head.
[00:04:08.311 --> 00:04:09.872]  So that's all coming up, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:09.912 --> 00:04:12.893]  Kathryn Austen Fitz, full interview, Planetary Lockdown, coming up.
[00:04:12.973 --> 00:04:17.055]  And then, Stuart Rhodes, in studio.
[00:04:17.476 --> 00:04:19.136]  And I'll tell you how the Zeitgeist worked.
[00:04:20.017 --> 00:04:22.238]  Talking to Stuart today before he gets here for the interview.
[00:04:22.258 --> 00:04:25.039]  I guess he's gotten here now.
[00:04:25.119 --> 00:04:25.980]  He's here now.
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.942]  And he says, hey, have you seen Kathryn Austen Fitz's new documentary?
[00:04:31.445 --> 00:04:32.385]  Planetary lockdown.
[00:04:32.525 --> 00:04:33.926]  And I said, yeah, it's planet lockdown.
[00:04:33.966 --> 00:04:34.346]  It's funny.
[00:04:34.766 --> 00:04:36.747]  I was thinking about getting her on about that and forgot.
[00:04:36.767 --> 00:04:38.668]  And he said, well, they're taking it down everywhere.
[00:04:38.928 --> 00:04:39.548]  You should play it.
[00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:45.010]  So again, that's just an example of how all of our word of mouth has an effect.
[00:04:45.391 --> 00:04:46.351]  I'd forgotten about this.
[00:04:46.491 --> 00:04:47.571]  He told me it's being censored.
[00:04:47.611 --> 00:04:48.412]  Now you're going to get to see it.
[00:04:50.152 --> 00:04:53.194]  And it's going to get posted at band.video.
[00:04:53.234 --> 00:04:54.094]  And I just salute her.
[00:04:54.114 --> 00:04:55.295]  She's one of the smartest people I know.
[00:04:55.935 --> 00:04:57.936]  Really, really am honored that she's a guest.
[00:04:58.496 --> 00:04:58.756]  Okay.
[00:05:00.543 --> 00:05:02.564]  So that's coming up, and then Stuart Rhodes in studio.
[00:05:03.884 --> 00:05:17.969]  So Stuart, by recommending this, just got himself to sit there 45 minutes, but he's happy to do it just like you are, because he'll just be sharing the video out to his Oath Keepers while he's watching, which I hope you'll be doing while you're watching as well.
[00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:23.291]  Okay, let's get right into it right now before we get to Planet Lockdown.
[00:05:24.672 --> 00:05:26.392]  Remember this tweet from a couple years ago?
[00:05:26.772 --> 00:05:28.333]  Representative Eric Swallowswell?
[00:05:29.226 --> 00:05:35.009]  The individual that is an admitted communist Chinese agent who ran the impeachment part two on Trump and who now is on the Intelligence Committee.
[00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:50.076]  They call that the Fox guarding the Hent House and a person tweeted to him when he was saying we're gonna ban all semi-automatic rifles and he said well out of my cold dead hands he said and it would be a short war my friend.
[00:05:50.876 --> 00:05:51.817]  The government has nukes.
[00:05:52.674 --> 00:05:54.194]  Too many of them, but they're legit.
[00:05:54.394 --> 00:05:59.736]  I'm sure if we talked, we could find common ground to protect our families and communities.
[00:06:01.456 --> 00:06:07.278]  So he's saying, we'll use nuclear weapons on you, which has nothing to do with gun confiscation.
[00:06:07.618 --> 00:06:11.459]  You'd kill just as many libtards as you'd kill patriots, nuking a city.
[00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:12.099]  In fact, more.
[00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:15.440]  Most of the cities are under fraud, under election fraud permanently.
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.220]  They are blue globalist sectors.
[00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.201]  Now let's move along to the New York Times, Friday.
[00:06:22.884 --> 00:06:25.787]  How to Defeat America's Homegrown Insurgency.
[00:06:26.827 --> 00:06:35.555]  And that's from Mr. Greener, Robert Greener, former CIA Station Chief for Pakistan and Afghanistan, Iraq Mission Manager, and Director of the CIA's Counterterrorism Center.
[00:06:36.015 --> 00:06:41.100]  They couldn't even defeat the Taliban, the Viet Cong, anybody other than Blue Blood.
[00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:46.264]  All the actual trigger pullers of the CIA hate this guy, hate Phil Mudd, hate all of them.
[00:06:46.664 --> 00:06:48.326]  But you've got this Blue Blood academic
[00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:53.751]  With visions of how he's going to run death camps and round up squads.
[00:06:53.771 --> 00:06:58.612]  You have the White House having a press conference saying, we're going to interdict and disrupt Trump networks.
[00:06:58.972 --> 00:07:01.193]  And they've taken his bank accounts away, his YouTube, his Twitter.
[00:07:01.653 --> 00:07:08.455]  I mean, they're declaring you a terrorist and even, even Tucker Carlson sits there and says, my God, they've declared war on the American people.
[00:07:08.535 --> 00:07:09.575]  This is crazy.
[00:07:09.895 --> 00:07:11.916]  Here's the full article, How to Defeat America's Homegrown.
[00:07:13.579 --> 00:07:14.159]  Insurgency.
[00:07:14.199 --> 00:07:21.144]  You mean the million people that peacefully showed up in DC and then provocateurs got maybe 150 to go into the Capitol and four patriots got killed?
[00:07:22.124 --> 00:07:23.125]  And one cop had a heart attack?
[00:07:23.385 --> 00:07:24.626]  That's the insurgency now?
[00:07:25.467 --> 00:07:27.608]  I mean, Obama's like, I'm really good at killing people.
[00:07:28.128 --> 00:07:31.150]  On average, they kill about 140 innocent people for every drone strike.
[00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.953]  But he's a black guy, and he's liberal, so he's like, I'm really good at killing people.
[00:07:35.533 --> 00:07:37.274]  One, you know, one word or two words.
[00:07:37.354 --> 00:07:38.215]  Predator drones.
[00:07:39.375 --> 00:07:40.076]  How sick is that?
[00:07:41.537 --> 00:07:41.697]  So,
[00:07:44.104 --> 00:07:48.527]  But, oh, but Chuckie Schumer called this as bad as Pearl Harbor.
[00:07:48.547 --> 00:07:48.987]  Remember that?
[00:07:50.508 --> 00:07:55.070]  Meanwhile, Nadler confronted six months ago about Antifa burning down cities, killing people everywhere.
[00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:56.551]  He said, oh, Antifa's a myth.
[00:07:56.651 --> 00:07:57.672]  It doesn't exist.
[00:07:57.732 --> 00:07:59.453]  That's how they gaslight you.
[00:07:59.493 --> 00:08:00.294]  That's how they lie to you.
[00:08:00.494 --> 00:08:01.634]  Full interview at Infowars.com.
[00:08:01.654 --> 00:08:02.355]  You've got to see it.
[00:08:02.715 --> 00:08:03.876]  Tucker Carlson is gas.
[00:08:03.896 --> 00:08:05.977]  The government is at war with its own people.
[00:08:06.617 --> 00:08:07.578]  He does a fabulous job.
[00:08:10.239 --> 00:08:11.721]  But here's the first clip I want to play.
[00:08:12.341 --> 00:08:16.886]  Former SEC Commissioner compares GameStop Squeeze to Capitol Riot.
[00:08:16.946 --> 00:08:22.291]  I know most of you know this, but for new viewers that don't, the most predatory part of Wall Street is the short seller.
[00:08:23.432 --> 00:08:24.754]  Betting that a stock is going to go down.
[00:08:25.988 --> 00:08:29.729]  And it's one thing if you bet because you think it's a fraud, that could be something that's a market balancer.
[00:08:30.029 --> 00:08:49.136]  But most of it's big hedge funds destroying, like Gordon Gekko in the famous Wall Street movie that's based on a composite of true stories, where it's a small airline that's owned by a union, and they badmouth it in the news, they attack it, he manipulates people within the company to bring the airline down so he can take it over.
[00:08:50.276 --> 00:08:52.257]  That's how this stuff really works.
[00:08:53.522 --> 00:08:55.744]  And so they've got their big shows to attack.
[00:08:55.784 --> 00:09:01.329]  They've got their big MSNBC, CNBC shows to say this stock's going to zero.
[00:09:01.689 --> 00:09:04.192]  When they make billions of dollars destroying companies, that's fine.
[00:09:04.592 --> 00:09:06.594]  It's always American companies, never Chinese companies.
[00:09:08.375 --> 00:09:12.599]  So former SEC commissioner compares GameStop Squeeze to Capitol Riot.
[00:09:14.501 --> 00:09:15.782]  To a Capitol Riot.
[00:09:16.502 --> 00:09:18.084]  And basically says, arrest the people.
[00:09:18.284 --> 00:09:20.106]  And Elizabeth Warren
[00:09:21.368 --> 00:09:22.408]  Says arrest the people.
[00:09:22.468 --> 00:09:27.470]  So, again, the Capitol riot is as bad as Pearl Harbor.
[00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:33.332]  Almost 3,000 dead, 500 Japanese aircraft bombing and sinking more than 30 ships.
[00:09:34.732 --> 00:09:36.993]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is the new Pearl Harbor.
[00:09:37.013 --> 00:09:40.494]  I mean, how insulting to all of you and the memory of those that died.
[00:09:40.774 --> 00:09:41.634]  It's just truly sick.
[00:09:43.295 --> 00:09:46.836]  So here's the former SEC commissioner compares GameStop squeeze to Capitol riot.
[00:09:48.305 --> 00:09:49.566]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:10:09.641 --> 00:10:13.823]  And that kind of feels like what's happening with this much different, much lesser degree.
[00:10:13.903 --> 00:10:16.724]  It's financial harm, not personal bodily harm.
[00:10:17.164 --> 00:10:25.426]  But certainly that's the same kind of, you know, platform created frenzy that people are operating under.
[00:10:25.466 --> 00:10:26.907]  And these are very trying times.
[00:10:28.326 --> 00:10:36.049]  So, again, you've got 10 stocks, AMC and others, brick and mortar, shut down because of the COVID lockdown.
[00:10:36.069 --> 00:10:42.271]  You have big tech doubling its money the last 11 months during the lockdown, admitting they engineered it to consolidate power.
[00:10:43.551 --> 00:10:50.434]  And then some people on Reddit say, why don't we prop up an American company and do a short squeeze
[00:10:51.992 --> 00:10:53.693]  And prop up American stocks.
[00:10:53.793 --> 00:10:56.115]  And now that is financial terrorism.
[00:10:56.656 --> 00:10:58.697]  Not the big hedge funds running their scams.
[00:10:59.198 --> 00:11:03.000]  Well, they've lost $80 billion now on the 10 stocks they were shorting.
[00:11:03.461 --> 00:11:05.102]  So it's a good lesson to these dirtbags.
[00:11:05.142 --> 00:11:07.964]  But now Democrats are saying, bail out.
[00:11:08.064 --> 00:11:13.108]  Elizabeth Warren is saying, arrest people, including 15-year-olds that took their savings.
[00:11:13.228 --> 00:11:15.410]  One 15-year-old is on the news, put in $1,000.
[00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:15.750]  He got $55,000 back.
[00:11:19.833 --> 00:11:22.555]  Because he actually stood up against the big guys.
[00:11:22.636 --> 00:11:23.236]  Is it dangerous?
[00:11:23.276 --> 00:11:24.257]  It's a speculative damn right.
[00:11:24.477 --> 00:11:26.219]  But they don't want you in the game.
[00:11:26.259 --> 00:11:27.760]  They want to feed on you.
[00:11:28.321 --> 00:11:29.141]  They're the anointed ones.
[00:11:29.161 --> 00:11:30.242]  They're the white shoe boys.
[00:11:31.403 --> 00:11:32.464]  They're the establishment.
[00:11:34.006 --> 00:11:36.808]  And they've got to always win in a rigged game.
[00:11:36.848 --> 00:11:37.849]  Just like the rigged election.
[00:11:38.209 --> 00:11:40.772]  Just like big tech Facebook Google came in.
[00:11:42.648 --> 00:11:45.352]  Blocking people even promoting this or talking about it.
[00:11:45.653 --> 00:11:47.636]  See, oh, don't talk about stolen elections.
[00:11:47.656 --> 00:11:49.038]  Don't talk about COVID being a hoax.
[00:11:49.639 --> 00:11:51.061]  Oh, don't talk about pedophile rings.
[00:11:51.261 --> 00:11:53.364]  Oh, now don't talk about this.
[00:11:53.505 --> 00:11:54.406]  And it's going to be everything.
[00:11:55.227 --> 00:11:57.310]  It's a technocracy that's coming in.
[00:11:59.013 --> 00:12:00.013]  And that is taking over.
[00:12:00.253 --> 00:12:01.294]  Absolutely incredible.
[00:12:01.394 --> 00:12:04.575]  They're now coming out and admitting Google, Facebook, Twitter, listen, everything going on in your home.
[00:12:04.615 --> 00:12:06.655]  I told you this over a decade ago from their own documents.
[00:12:06.955 --> 00:12:12.797]  Now Spotify admits they're listening to you over your app at all times to quote, build a psychological profile on you.
[00:12:13.757 --> 00:12:14.237]  Continuing.
[00:12:19.339 --> 00:12:23.500]  Biden DHS says anyone that dissatisfied with the status quo is a terrorist.
[00:12:24.889 --> 00:12:25.429]  Here's another one.
[00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:26.751]  Tulsi Gabbards.
[00:12:27.091 --> 00:12:34.918]  Like throwing a match into a tinderbox, Gabbards slams Pelosi's enemy within the House for a mark, saying they want to arrest members of the House that are secretly plotting to kill her.
[00:12:35.618 --> 00:12:38.981]  And AOC is now running around saying, I want Ted Cruz to resign!
[00:12:39.982 --> 00:12:43.706]  He tried to kill me, you crazy lunatic Marxist!
[00:12:44.066 --> 00:12:46.048]  You're the people that kill folks, you little pig!
[00:12:47.932 --> 00:12:57.195]  Meanwhile, law enforcement today reports Acting Capitol Police Chief admits they knew violence was coming, but didn't warn officers or prepare them for the riot.
[00:12:57.215 --> 00:13:06.118]  In fact, they ordered many of them to go to traffic control on purpose, knowing provocateurs were going to try to manipulate the crowd of a million people, which they manipulated about 200.
[00:13:06.178 --> 00:13:07.399]  Wow!
[00:13:07.699 --> 00:13:08.979]  Most of them stayed in the velvet ropes.
[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:13.821]  As best we can tell, about 15 people actually attacked the police.
[00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:18.062]  Inside the Capitol, probably about a hundred outside.
[00:13:18.622 --> 00:13:19.784]  That's the new Pearl Harbor.
[00:13:19.944 --> 00:13:22.206]  That's the end of the world, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:23.547 --> 00:13:23.948]  Okay.
[00:13:25.569 --> 00:13:26.570]  Let's go ahead now.
[00:13:26.851 --> 00:13:32.817]  And before we go to this incredible documentary with Catherine Austen Fitz, that is so censored that I hope you share it.
[00:13:34.343 --> 00:13:35.444]  Because who knows how long we'll be on there?
[00:13:35.484 --> 00:13:36.745]  Who knows how long Bandot video?
[00:13:36.985 --> 00:13:48.436]  I mean, I told you that by the election they would have basically internet kill switch on all conservatives, and that after they started stealing the election in the 79 days of hell between November 3rd and January 20th, 2021,
[00:13:50.077 --> 00:13:51.558]  I told you it would be 79 days of hell.
[00:13:51.878 --> 00:13:55.919]  Joe Rogan asked me, with Tim Dillon on his show, three days before the election, he said, what's going to happen?
[00:13:56.159 --> 00:13:57.640]  I said, Trump's going to win in a landslide.
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:00.421]  You'll see him get higher numbers in all the battleground states.
[00:14:00.781 --> 00:14:03.902]  You'll see him get 35% of black votes, which he did.
[00:14:04.402 --> 00:14:05.723]  That's triple anybody ever got.
[00:14:06.943 --> 00:14:08.544]  That's if you combine women and men together.
[00:14:08.564 --> 00:14:09.864]  He got an even higher number of black men.
[00:14:09.924 --> 00:14:11.165]  I mean, that's a huge awakening.
[00:14:11.665 --> 00:14:16.947]  And I said, but then they're going to steal it and try to steal it for the 79 days of hell, and they'll probably successfully steal it.
[00:14:18.746 --> 00:14:25.151]  We ought to find that clip and play it on my Sunday show, because it's just incredible how dead-on we are.
[00:14:25.611 --> 00:14:27.112]  I mean, and that's why they want us off the air.
[00:14:27.152 --> 00:14:31.235]  So, please, share the live link right now, and share the archive link at BandaiVideo.
[00:14:31.896 --> 00:14:33.017]  Okay, let's get into this.
[00:14:34.237 --> 00:14:43.885]  Owen, on Thursday, I co-hosted with Owen, and I had seen Mitt Romney say, wear two masks, and Fauci say two, and I said, everybody's taking the mask off right now.
[00:14:43.925 --> 00:14:45.005]  It's all psychological warfare.
[00:14:45.025 --> 00:14:46.907]  I can see the pre-programming every step of the way.
[00:14:48.562 --> 00:14:52.706]  I said they're going to have people come out and say 3 masks, 4 masks, 5 masks, 6 masks.
[00:14:53.146 --> 00:14:55.528]  I said by next week they'll be saying wear 6 masks.
[00:14:55.608 --> 00:14:57.329]  Well, it happened a day earlier than I thought.
[00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:00.492]  CNN today said you need 6 masks.
[00:15:01.493 --> 00:15:02.674]  But it gets a lot worse.
[00:15:02.794 --> 00:15:04.315]  The article's on Infowars.com.
[00:15:04.335 --> 00:15:04.916]  Please pull it up.
[00:15:08.378 --> 00:15:09.720]  CNN is very excited about it.
[00:15:11.141 --> 00:15:17.106]  The new executive order by Joe Biden says starting Monday, all federal travel, anything on planes,
[00:15:18.561 --> 00:15:30.492]  TSA, Department of Transportation, and CDC now claim jurisdiction over all travel on any type of interstate highway, airlines, boats, trains, buses.
[00:15:31.593 --> 00:15:32.855]  You will wear two masks.
[00:15:33.535 --> 00:15:37.039]  They will be affixed to your ears by cloth.
[00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:39.521]  No more just a bandana.
[00:15:40.582 --> 00:15:42.043]  And it says the CDC
[00:15:43.853 --> 00:15:45.333]  ...has authority to have you arrested.
[00:15:45.374 --> 00:15:47.994]  So the CDC is announcing arrest power.
[00:15:48.534 --> 00:15:49.535]  Total power.
[00:15:49.575 --> 00:15:51.235]  Remember, they're run by Bill Gates.
[00:15:51.955 --> 00:15:54.736]  And Bill Gates is on the news Friday saying shut down all of his competition.
[00:15:55.076 --> 00:15:57.637]  Anybody criticizing him, he wants arrested and censored.
[00:15:59.237 --> 00:16:01.118]  So here's the article on Infowars.com.
[00:16:01.158 --> 00:16:04.238]  You might want to share it on your email, your text message, while you still can.
[00:16:04.459 --> 00:16:05.359]  Medical tyranny.
[00:16:05.459 --> 00:16:08.300]  CDC announces all travelers must wear two masks.
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:09.660]  Threatens arrest.
[00:16:12.981 --> 00:16:26.128]  The CDC announced an order late Friday that will require people to wear, it's an order, it's not a law, it's an order, to wear a face mask while using any form of public transportation including buses, trains, taxis, airplanes, boats.
[00:16:26.188 --> 00:16:27.609]  They just declaimed jurisdiction.
[00:16:27.749 --> 00:16:29.089]  If I'm out on my boat, I'm supposed to wear one.
[00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:35.513]  Subways or rideshare vehicles while traveling into and without the U.S.
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:41.103]  Now see, notice that's a border law, but it's meant to manipulate, but you think it's everywhere.
[00:16:41.123 --> 00:16:43.125]  Now you're gonna see cops arresting everybody, even though it's not the law.
[00:16:43.705 --> 00:16:46.367]  The order goes into effect 1159 p.m.
[00:16:46.407 --> 00:16:46.708]  Monday.
[00:16:47.308 --> 00:16:51.051]  Masks must be worn while waiting, boarding, traveling, and disembarking, it said.
[00:16:51.772 --> 00:17:00.519]  The coverings need to be at least two or more layers, two masks, by breathing fabric secured to the head with ties and ear loops or ear bands.
[00:17:01.099 --> 00:17:02.781]  And scarves and bananas do not count.
[00:17:02.981 --> 00:17:04.142]  See, I told you that was coming next.
[00:17:05.233 --> 00:17:11.917]  The order says, the CDC says it reserves the right, this is the key, to enforce the order through criminal penalties.
[00:17:12.097 --> 00:17:13.438]  Oh, they reserve the right!
[00:17:13.678 --> 00:17:14.219]  They're God!
[00:17:14.599 --> 00:17:20.883]  But it strongly encourages and anticipates widespread voluntary compliance and expects support from other federal agencies to implement the order.
[00:17:21.343 --> 00:17:22.844]  Federal Police!
[00:17:23.905 --> 00:17:24.965]  Look at this, here's the CNN headline.
[00:17:25.446 --> 00:17:27.247]  Federal Police!
[00:17:28.147 --> 00:17:29.848]  To make sure you wear two masks!
[00:17:29.868 --> 00:17:32.430]  And when you bitch about that, it'll be three masks!
[00:17:33.291 --> 00:17:33.631]  Here we go.
[00:17:35.868 --> 00:17:39.310]  Owen did this on Thursday.
[00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:40.511]  I mean, I wasn't joking.
[00:17:43.052 --> 00:17:43.953]  One mass is absurd.
[00:17:44.013 --> 00:17:44.773]  Ten mass is absurd.
[00:17:44.793 --> 00:17:45.334]  It's all the same.
[00:17:45.354 --> 00:17:51.478]  Here we go.
[00:17:51.618 --> 00:17:52.398]  I'm a good person now.
[00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:55.940]  Just smother me.
[00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:56.881]  It's a total joke.
[00:17:56.961 --> 00:17:57.881]  Stand on your head.
[00:17:58.882 --> 00:18:00.223]  And we've got video coming up.
[00:18:02.017 --> 00:18:08.181]  A Klaus Schwab that runs all this for the UN saying, you will never have jobs with physical contact again.
[00:18:10.043 --> 00:18:20.290]  And I have cartoons put out a decade ago called Plandopolis where they teach kids in the UK that in the future an app on your phone tells you when you can leave your house and when you can go to work and what job you'll have.
[00:18:22.571 --> 00:18:23.432]  You will have nothing.
[00:18:23.552 --> 00:18:24.393]  You will own nothing.
[00:18:24.873 --> 00:18:25.513]  You will like it.
[00:18:25.673 --> 00:18:26.614]  No, I will not like it.
[00:18:26.994 --> 00:18:27.735]  You monster.
[00:18:29.991 --> 00:18:31.231]  This is the New Dark Ages.
[00:18:31.972 --> 00:18:33.572]  This is the planetary siege weapon.
[00:18:35.333 --> 00:18:40.374]  This is the total absolute takeover and it's been planned.
[00:18:40.634 --> 00:18:45.256]  I'm showing you a children's cartoon from a decade ago shown in UK public schools.
[00:18:47.056 --> 00:18:48.357]  Unbelievable.
[00:18:48.457 --> 00:18:50.237]  And oh, look, it shows you the years.
[00:18:50.317 --> 00:18:52.638]  By 2030, you're not allowed to leave your house.
[00:18:55.199 --> 00:18:58.501]  The Global Food Council runs everything, controls everything.
[00:18:58.541 --> 00:19:01.903]  This is all pre-planned, 110%.
[00:19:03.244 --> 00:19:05.906]  So let's go back to the document cam shot, please.
[00:19:07.427 --> 00:19:08.147]  Medical tyranny.
[00:19:08.187 --> 00:19:10.229]  CDC announces all travelers must wear two masks.
[00:19:10.249 --> 00:19:10.989]  Threatens arrest.
[00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:13.751]  Announces total jurisdictional power over everyone.
[00:19:15.092 --> 00:19:17.093]  CDC threatens travelers to wear masks.
[00:19:18.794 --> 00:19:20.095]  All forms of public transportation.
[00:19:20.115 --> 00:19:21.236]  Here's the actual CNN article.
[00:19:23.775 --> 00:19:24.756]  It just doesn't work.
[00:19:24.816 --> 00:19:30.918]  An exacerbated Macron, that's the French dictator, vaccine credibility as EU approves AstraZeneca.
[00:19:32.459 --> 00:19:41.063]  Now, why did they have the British Ministry come out a month and a half ago and say, don't take the shot if you're over 75, under 16, or pregnant in fine print, because it's killing people.
[00:19:41.644 --> 00:19:44.025]  But then they actually recommend on the news, there you take it.
[00:19:44.505 --> 00:19:45.105]  It's the same thing.
[00:19:45.145 --> 00:19:50.448]  Macron knows this thing's deadly, knows it's not a vaccine, it's a gene therapy to sterilize you bare minimum, cause autoimmune disorders.
[00:19:51.616 --> 00:19:57.579]  So he covers his ass and says you probably shouldn't take the shot, it doesn't work, but then they make you do it to get on buses there now.
[00:19:57.999 --> 00:20:05.363]  Worse, Drew Thompson, our reporter, I sent him yesterday, or two days ago to New York.
[00:20:07.484 --> 00:20:20.371]  He gets off the plane and they've got checkpoints with troops making sure you've signed an app with the threat of a huge fine that tracks everywhere you go and gives them your phone number and who has the contract for contact tracing in New York?
[00:20:21.817 --> 00:20:24.799]  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation slash Clinton Global Initiative.
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:25.640]  Yeah, yeah, show it.
[00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:26.541]  It's at the first of the video.
[00:20:27.302 --> 00:20:31.985]  He talks for a while in the car, and then it shows him getting off the airplane, and there's troops, and he shows the whole app.
[00:20:33.547 --> 00:20:34.527]  This is total control.
[00:20:34.568 --> 00:20:35.568]  It's already on your phone.
[00:20:35.789 --> 00:20:37.150]  They want you opting into it.
[00:20:39.231 --> 00:20:40.392]  Oh, the border is wide open.
[00:20:41.033 --> 00:20:47.158]  Bet, oh, you're going to get contact trace going to New York where they killed 12,000 old people giving them COVID, not 6,000 like we told you.
[00:20:51.957 --> 00:20:52.777]  So let's continue.
[00:20:55.479 --> 00:20:59.661]  A fight between the EU and the UK reveals the ugly truth about vaccine nationalism.
[00:20:59.982 --> 00:21:04.684]  The UN is mad that France and others are saying the vaccine's dangerous.
[00:21:04.944 --> 00:21:06.065]  The politicians are scared.
[00:21:06.105 --> 00:21:07.966]  My God, we're going to kill people and sterilize them?
[00:21:08.266 --> 00:21:08.927]  Yeah, you are!
[00:21:09.047 --> 00:21:09.487]  Shut up!
[00:21:12.026 --> 00:21:13.247]  Here's from weather.com.
[00:21:13.287 --> 00:21:15.609]  Flu cases remain almost non-existent in the U.S.
[00:21:15.669 --> 00:21:19.713]  and around the world because they're all being counted as COVID illnesses and deaths.
[00:21:20.514 --> 00:21:20.834]  See that?
[00:21:21.194 --> 00:21:22.355]  Told you that 11 months ago.
[00:21:26.579 --> 00:21:27.440]  Let us play!
[00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:31.603]  Kids march on Michigan State Capitol demand return of high school sports.
[00:21:33.045 --> 00:21:33.986]  Oh no!
[00:21:34.266 --> 00:21:42.832]  Klaus Schwab said any contact is not allowed unless the new Health and Human Services head says tranny orgies are okay.
[00:21:43.592 --> 00:21:47.855]  And North Texas College said when you masturbate, you should wear a mask.
[00:21:48.656 --> 00:21:49.516]  You know, it doesn't even make sense.
[00:21:49.536 --> 00:21:50.257]  You're by yourself.
[00:21:50.657 --> 00:21:52.198]  It's not meant to make sense.
[00:21:52.298 --> 00:21:56.041]  It's meant to make you do what you're told and to make it more absurd.
[00:21:56.281 --> 00:22:00.744]  So staying locked up and wearing a mask doesn't sound so crazy if they're telling you wear a mask when you masturbate.
[00:22:03.203 --> 00:22:06.546]  Video, lockdown protester has skull fractured by water cannon.
[00:22:06.846 --> 00:22:09.208]  They've been killing some people in Germany doing this.
[00:22:09.228 --> 00:22:10.128]  Let's go ahead and roll.
[00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:15.272]  Clip four and five of people protesting in Michigan.
[00:22:15.312 --> 00:22:15.953]  This is the answer.
[00:22:16.293 --> 00:22:18.735]  And then a lockdown protester's skull fractured in Germany.
[00:22:19.015 --> 00:22:19.315]  Six.
[00:22:19.556 --> 00:22:20.797]  Play four, five, and six together.
[00:22:21.877 --> 00:22:23.319]  Come on, I need to hear everybody real loud!
[00:22:23.339 --> 00:22:23.619]  Let us win!
[00:22:23.659 --> 00:22:31.545]  Let us win!
[00:22:31.565 --> 00:22:31.805]  Let us win!
[00:22:31.825 --> 00:22:32.045]  Let us win!
[00:22:32.065 --> 00:22:32.866]  Hey, is anybody- Explanation.
[00:22:34.474 --> 00:22:37.597]  It is the dream of all our athletes to succeed.
[00:22:38.417 --> 00:22:45.122]  It is about giving our kids good, wholesome opportunities for a lifetime of success.
[00:22:45.643 --> 00:22:46.644]  You didn't hear you're obsolete?
[00:22:46.664 --> 00:22:47.604]  You're non-essential?
[00:22:48.165 --> 00:22:56.812]  Today, by repeating my call from last August, Governor Whitmer, please open the ticket booths.
[00:22:57.452 --> 00:22:58.733]  Open the football games!
[00:22:58.773 --> 00:22:59.794]  Don't ask that whore!
[00:22:59.974 --> 00:23:00.815]  Don't ask that monster!
[00:23:03.647 --> 00:23:12.592]  And let our Michigan athletes play the game that will return community pride, spirit, and the excitement to our neighborhoods.
[00:23:13.393 --> 00:23:14.653]  Let them play!
[00:23:15.094 --> 00:23:16.274]  No, get back in your house.
[00:23:17.155 --> 00:23:19.156]  See, while you played football, they stole the country.
[00:23:19.536 --> 00:23:20.857]  Now they've taken it away from you, Bubba.
[00:23:21.057 --> 00:23:24.659]  You're gonna take vaccines, have a tracker chip to play football, then that'll be taken away from you too.
[00:23:24.939 --> 00:23:25.399]  Grow up!
[00:23:28.081 --> 00:23:28.821]  Oh yeah, show that again.
[00:23:28.881 --> 00:23:29.282]  Here's the woman.
[00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:33.061]  And I've got the video of her eyeball almost knocked out.
[00:23:33.681 --> 00:23:34.621]  It was high-powered water.
[00:23:34.641 --> 00:23:35.821]  When you first turn them on, they can kill you.
[00:23:37.002 --> 00:23:37.862]  I got photos of her.
[00:23:39.662 --> 00:23:41.303]  And her whole face torn open down with a stone.
[00:23:44.424 --> 00:23:46.924]  But that's what they do to women, to keep them safe!
[00:23:47.144 --> 00:23:48.165]  Keep you safe!
[00:23:48.185 --> 00:23:50.165]  Klaus Schwab said so!
[00:23:53.446 --> 00:23:54.326]  That's fascism.
[00:23:55.347 --> 00:23:56.327]  That's authoritarianism.
[00:23:56.347 --> 00:23:57.067]  You're not needed.
[00:23:57.087 --> 00:23:58.047]  You're under control now.
[00:23:58.288 --> 00:23:59.528]  They've invented you with Islam.
[00:24:00.558 --> 00:24:01.659]  They've attacked you with everything.
[00:24:01.699 --> 00:24:03.080]  They're taking you down.
[00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:04.060]  They're globalists.
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:04.881]  They think you're weak.
[00:24:05.081 --> 00:24:05.981]  They think you're domesticated.
[00:24:06.001 --> 00:24:06.702]  They're laughing.
[00:24:09.083 --> 00:24:10.564]  The more you lay down, the worse it gets.
[00:24:10.624 --> 00:24:11.505]  Everybody's being trained.
[00:24:11.905 --> 00:24:14.647]  Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, they're the enemy.
[00:24:16.368 --> 00:24:27.014]  And you find them sharing this live feed and the archive of this video and what we're about to air with Katherine Austin Fitts and the planetary lockdown, the documentary Planet Lockdown.
[00:24:28.895 --> 00:24:29.916]  But before we do that,
[00:24:31.513 --> 00:24:38.302]  I just want to tell listeners that tomorrow is the last day at InfoWarsTore.com in the January special.
[00:24:38.602 --> 00:24:41.205]  This is the last day of the month.
[00:24:41.225 --> 00:24:45.491]  50% off X2, X3, Alpha Power, so many other bestsellers.
[00:24:47.363 --> 00:24:50.264]  We're about to sell all of these products just like I've sold out of Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:24:51.144 --> 00:24:55.585]  The one thing that will sell me 50% off is Ultra 12 because it was sold out for only a few weeks.
[00:24:55.705 --> 00:24:56.445]  It's back in.
[00:24:56.866 --> 00:24:58.886]  High quality Vitamin B12 is back in Ultra 12.
[00:24:59.246 --> 00:25:00.306]  It is 50% off.
[00:25:00.907 --> 00:25:01.687]  So that will continue.
[00:25:01.747 --> 00:25:08.088]  Everything else, starting Monday morning, is not on sale anymore because it's almost all sold out.
[00:25:08.129 --> 00:25:09.069]  So thank you for your support.
[00:25:11.158 --> 00:25:19.365]  Being sold out is not a good thing because we used to be able to actually, most of our products, we can't even get enough of them now because the supply chain is broken down and stuff's behind and all the rest of it.
[00:25:19.625 --> 00:25:22.107]  Everything we've got is in stock ready to ship to you right now.
[00:25:22.588 --> 00:25:24.789]  Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:25:29.634 --> 00:25:33.356]  Ultra-12, so good for your immune system, so good for your energy, stamina, everything.
[00:25:33.416 --> 00:25:33.997]  It's an essential.
[00:25:34.457 --> 00:25:35.578]  Vitamin B12, take it under the tongue.
[00:25:35.638 --> 00:25:36.498]  High-level absorption.
[00:25:36.518 --> 00:25:39.140]  A lot of folks want to absorb it in the gut, so put it under your tongue for about a minute.
[00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:40.361]  Tastes sweet naturally.
[00:25:40.461 --> 00:25:41.401]  People say, it tastes so good.
[00:25:41.741 --> 00:25:43.723]  It's such a beautiful red-purple color.
[00:25:44.143 --> 00:25:44.883]  It's all natural.
[00:25:45.344 --> 00:25:47.325]  B12's beautiful, folks.
[00:25:47.345 --> 00:25:48.245]  And it's back in stock.
[00:25:48.285 --> 00:25:48.766]  Ultra-12.
[00:25:48.826 --> 00:25:50.467]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:25:51.607 --> 00:25:57.911]  And hopefully, a lot of other products that have been sold out we'll get back in soon, like Winter Sun and Vitamin Refusion, but that's going to be a while.
[00:25:59.608 --> 00:26:05.859]  I'm going to go ahead now and go to Katherine Austin Fitz's documentary.
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:10.601]  And as soon as this shows over, it'll be archived to Band.Video.
[00:26:11.021 --> 00:26:16.963]  So I hope that you share this presentation and the documentary itself that we're going to have posted, because it all goes together.
[00:26:17.763 --> 00:26:20.884]  We're going through the same cycle again, this time with a high-tech overlay.
[00:26:20.904 --> 00:26:21.785]  We're going to make it together.
[00:26:21.805 --> 00:26:24.526]  It's going to take focus and endurance and prayer to God.
[00:26:24.886 --> 00:26:26.366]  So again, thank you all for keeping us on the air.
[00:26:26.406 --> 00:26:27.206]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[00:26:27.507 --> 00:26:28.367]  Thank you to this amazing crew.
[00:26:28.387 --> 00:26:29.407]  We're working seven days a week.
[00:26:29.507 --> 00:26:31.628]  These are historical times.
[00:26:33.254 --> 00:26:34.474]  Planetary lockdown.
[00:26:34.914 --> 00:26:35.895]  Planet lockdown.
[00:26:36.215 --> 00:26:36.735]  Here it is.
[00:26:51.638 --> 00:26:53.298]  My name is Catherine Austin Fitz.
[00:26:53.378 --> 00:26:58.759]  I'm the publisher of the Solari Report and managing director of Solari Investment Advisory Services.
[00:27:00.558 --> 00:27:04.440]  And what do you think is happening economically as a result of all this?
[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:11.362]  So what is happening, I just published a huge study called The State of Our Currencies.
[00:27:12.383 --> 00:27:17.905]  And what I describe is the fact that for many decades, the dollar has been the reserve currency.
[00:27:19.085 --> 00:27:23.047]  And the system is what I would describe as long in the tooth.
[00:27:24.347 --> 00:27:29.751]  And the central bankers are trying to bring in a new system, but it's not ready to go yet.
[00:27:30.011 --> 00:27:39.377]  And we're in a period of great change and uncertainty where the central bankers are trying to keep the dollar system going and accelerate.
[00:27:39.457 --> 00:27:44.920]  So they're trying to lengthen the dollar system and then they're trying to accelerate bringing in the new system.
[00:27:45.861 --> 00:27:50.103]  And they have to bring in the new system without anybody quite realizing exactly what it is.
[00:27:51.364 --> 00:28:00.911]  So we've had a global reserve currency system, the dollar, and it needs to evolve and change and it's long in the tooth.
[00:28:00.951 --> 00:28:07.976]  There's lots of unhappiness with the system and the central bankers are trying to bring a new system and to do it
[00:28:08.616 --> 00:28:20.884]  They're trying to extend the old and accelerate the new, and it makes it a very chaotic thing since much of the new is being tested and tried and prototyped, and it involves many different industries.
[00:28:21.685 --> 00:28:25.408]  So I describe the new system as the end of currencies.
[00:28:25.788 --> 00:28:27.969]  So we're not bringing in a new currency.
[00:28:28.009 --> 00:28:34.474]  We're essentially bringing in a new transaction system that will be all digital and essentially end currencies as we know them.
[00:28:35.154 --> 00:28:39.917]  So what they're trying to do is involves essentially all the money on the planet.
[00:28:40.357 --> 00:28:42.978]  So it's big, it's complicated, it's messy.
[00:28:44.439 --> 00:28:50.362]  And the challenge they have is how do you market a system that if people understood it, nobody would want?
[00:28:51.282 --> 00:28:54.744]  And of course, the way you do that is with a health care crisis.
[00:28:56.525 --> 00:28:58.146]  Why is the health care crisis good for that?
[00:28:59.927 --> 00:29:03.749]  Because generally, if if a few people want to control the many,
[00:29:04.909 --> 00:29:13.371]  The question is how can you, you know, how can you herd all the sheep into the slaughterhouse without them realizing and resisting?
[00:29:14.332 --> 00:29:18.775]  So the perfect thing is invisible enemies.
[00:29:18.815 --> 00:29:25.779]  We had the war on terrorism with invisible terrorists and then now a virus is perfect because it's invisible.
[00:29:25.839 --> 00:29:29.962]  You can't prove that it doesn't exist because it's invisible.
[00:29:30.082 --> 00:29:34.444]  Invisible enemies are always the preferred one, particularly if they scare people.
[00:29:35.025 --> 00:29:36.206]  If you can use fear
[00:29:37.146 --> 00:29:37.466]  Thank you.
[00:29:37.726 --> 00:29:38.106]  Thank you.
[00:30:00.834 --> 00:30:00.934]  Yes.
[00:30:19.879 --> 00:30:21.360]  Enormous control mechanisms.
[00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:23.201]  You can stop people from gathering.
[00:30:23.241 --> 00:30:25.101]  You can stop people from organizing.
[00:30:25.141 --> 00:30:29.543]  You can stop people from getting together and talking about what's going on, etc, etc.
[00:30:29.964 --> 00:30:33.905]  And if you digitize it with contract tracing, then you can control who's talking to whom.
[00:30:34.426 --> 00:30:39.588]  If you can get them to do all their work and education online, you can literally listen to everything they're saying.
[00:30:40.268 --> 00:30:46.451]  So you can you can institute extraordinary amounts of surveillance all in the
[00:30:47.271 --> 00:30:50.455]  You know, the theory that we're protecting you from the invisible virus.
[00:30:50.856 --> 00:30:55.201]  It's very clever, you know, and as you can see, it's working with many people.
[00:30:55.281 --> 00:30:56.863]  Not everybody, but many people.
[00:30:56.923 --> 00:30:57.965]  So, to me...
[00:30:58.812 --> 00:30:59.212]  A lot.
[00:31:17.666 --> 00:31:22.071]  A solution before they see where it's ultimately going to go.
[00:31:22.231 --> 00:31:27.796]  Because you're talking about a transaction system that is no longer a currency.
[00:31:27.876 --> 00:31:28.857]  It's a control system.
[00:31:28.957 --> 00:31:31.760]  So it's like a credit at the company store.
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:38.147]  If every central bank comes out with a digital central bank currency, they have the ability to turn your money on and off.
[00:31:38.167 --> 00:31:39.048]  So if you don't behave,
[00:31:40.151 --> 00:31:40.611]  That's it.
[00:31:40.691 --> 00:31:51.238]  And of course, as we know, they want to combine this with transhumanism, which means literally, you know, I take injections that can institute the equivalent of an operating system in my body.
[00:31:51.859 --> 00:31:55.321]  And so I'm hooked up to the financial system literally physically.
[00:31:55.341 --> 00:31:58.623]  To step back to the beginning a little bit, a little 101.
[00:31:58.904 --> 00:31:59.184]  Sure.
[00:32:01.465 --> 00:32:03.827]  What is the actual effect of the lockdown measures?
[00:32:04.696 --> 00:32:12.641]  So what you're doing is you're trying to, I used to call the Patriot Act the Concentration and Control of Cash Flow Act, and this is a very similar process.
[00:32:12.661 --> 00:32:16.364]  You're trying to dramatically centralize economic and political control.
[00:32:16.904 --> 00:32:18.165]  So let me give you an example.
[00:32:18.745 --> 00:32:22.048]  We have 100 small businesses on Main Street in a community.
[00:32:22.788 --> 00:32:25.169]  You declare them non-essential, shut them down.
[00:32:25.309 --> 00:32:30.811]  Suddenly Amazon and Walmart and the big box stores can come in and take away all the market share.
[00:32:31.391 --> 00:32:36.332]  In the meantime, the people on Main Street have to keep paying off their credit cards or their mortgage.
[00:32:36.752 --> 00:32:38.273]  So they're in a debt entrapment.
[00:32:39.425 --> 00:32:44.768]  And they're desperate to get cash flow to cover basically their debts and their day-to-day expenses.
[00:32:45.708 --> 00:33:06.618]  In the meantime, you have the Federal Reserve institute a form of quantitative easing where they're buying corporate bonds and the guys who are taking up the market share can basically finance at, you know, 0 to 1% or their banks can at 0 to 1% when everybody in Main Street is paying 16 to 17% of their credit cards without income.
[00:33:07.478 --> 00:33:17.392]  So basically now you've got them over a barrel and you can take away their market share and generally they can't afford to do what they say because they're too busy trying to find money to feed their kids.
[00:33:18.293 --> 00:33:23.520]  In the 2016 election cycle we saw the general population support
[00:33:24.522 --> 00:33:24.702]  Yeah.
[00:33:39.802 --> 00:33:55.386]  What the sort of global capital class realized was they had a problem that could be solved by destroying the independent income of small business and sole practitioners and people who had independent forms of income.
[00:33:56.006 --> 00:34:05.936]  So if you're a doctor, if you're a lawyer, if you're a CPA and you have your own practice, you are generally going to support the populist candidates.
[00:34:05.996 --> 00:34:17.206]  And so the way to shut the populist candidates down is to shut off their income and support, which is you put Main Street out of business and then there's nobody to finance a Bernie Sanders or a Donald Trump.
[00:34:17.226 --> 00:34:18.848]  There's nobody to support him.
[00:34:21.416 --> 00:34:28.822]  So, I mean, do the lockdown measures appear to you to be more of an economic thing than a virus mitigation plan?
[00:34:29.123 --> 00:34:35.528]  So this is an economic war and you've basically had sort of the top 1%.
[00:34:35.568 --> 00:34:40.852]  So since April we've seen global billionaires increase their net worth by 27%.
[00:34:42.682 --> 00:34:54.736]  Now, what that says is this has been a very successful global economic war because what you're having is this sort of global capitalist class, and I shouldn't call it capitalism because it's not.
[00:34:54.796 --> 00:34:57.679]  It's economic totalitarianism.
[00:34:57.719 --> 00:35:03.206]  What you've seen is they've been able to consolidate fantastic amounts of economic wealth.
[00:35:03.826 --> 00:35:20.533]  Not just by deleting the income of the middle class and consolidating it into their companies, but by significantly improving the wealth and power of the largest G7 developed countries and China vis-a-vis the emerging markets.
[00:35:21.313 --> 00:35:23.174]  So, you know, the
[00:35:24.403 --> 00:35:39.226]  The countries with the most advanced technology and the access to AI and software and to the sort of digital systems, including through space, are dramatically consolidating economic power vis-a-vis the weaker nations.
[00:35:40.106 --> 00:35:52.929]  So we're seeing a consolidation of economic power, centralization, both into the wealthier and the more powerful nations and the basically top 1% who control them.
[00:35:54.967 --> 00:36:10.720]  So I would describe what COVID-19 is, is the institution of controls necessary to convert the planet from democratic process to technocracy.
[00:36:11.561 --> 00:36:13.763]  So what we're watching is a change in control.
[00:36:17.249 --> 00:36:18.951]  So think of this as a coup d'etat.
[00:36:19.491 --> 00:36:24.338]  It's much more like a coup d'etat than of ours.
[00:36:24.358 --> 00:36:29.825]  So for 20 some years in the United States, we've had a financial coup d'etat.
[00:36:30.706 --> 00:36:38.193]  And we knew at the end of 1995, a decision was made to move much of the assets and money out of the country.
[00:36:38.693 --> 00:36:42.737]  That was part of sort of bubbling the global economy of globalization.
[00:36:43.357 --> 00:36:50.363]  And they knew that once they'd finished moving all those assets, that they would have to consolidate and change the fundamental system.
[00:36:51.204 --> 00:36:55.047]  So after the financial coup, you've stolen all the money in the pension funds.
[00:36:55.087 --> 00:36:56.709]  You've stolen all the money in the government.
[00:36:57.209 --> 00:37:00.872]  And now, rather than turn and tell people, well, we stole your money,
[00:37:01.863 --> 00:37:08.109]  You need an excuse that will allow you to consolidate and change the fundamental system, and so you have a magic virus.
[00:37:09.210 --> 00:37:12.993]  And the magic virus says, oh, we have to fundamentally change the system.
[00:37:13.614 --> 00:37:16.156]  Thanks to the magic virus, there's no money in Social Security.
[00:37:16.196 --> 00:37:18.778]  Thanks to the magic virus, there's no money in the Treasury.
[00:37:18.798 --> 00:37:21.421]  And you have your perfect magic excuse.
[00:37:21.481 --> 00:37:22.602]  Everything can be blamed on the
[00:37:22.962 --> 00:37:32.387]  Yeah, the magic virus can, you know, it's amazing because every implication of the financial coup has been magically solved by the magic virus.
[00:37:33.414 --> 00:37:40.799]  It's quite, if you're a financial person and you look at the world through the mathematics of time and money, it's quite amazing that anybody believes it, but they do.
[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:42.360]  Right.
[00:37:42.701 --> 00:37:46.023]  It's part, it's part of joining the, you know, what C.J.
[00:37:46.063 --> 00:37:47.784]  Hopkins calls the Covidian cult.
[00:37:47.824 --> 00:37:49.685]  You join the cult and you say, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:37:49.725 --> 00:37:52.627]  Well, the magic virus took all the money from Social Security.
[00:37:53.048 --> 00:37:57.251]  The magic virus caused our pension funds to, you know, not be sufficient.
[00:37:57.931 --> 00:37:58.912]  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:06.869]  So what do you think the technocracy that we're being pushed towards will look like?
[00:38:07.851 --> 00:38:12.719]  So the technocracy that they're pushing towards is what is called transhumanism.
[00:38:13.962 --> 00:38:22.908]  So essentially what you do is you use injections to inject materials into the body that create the equivalent of an operating system.
[00:38:22.928 --> 00:38:34.776]  So everybody knows the idea of Microsoft causing you to download an operating system in your computer that gives Microsoft and a variety of other players a backdoor into your computer.
[00:38:35.336 --> 00:38:39.879]  And every month or two or three, you've got to update it because there are viruses, right?
[00:38:39.899 --> 00:38:43.262]  And it's back to the magic virus that can solve all problems.
[00:38:44.483 --> 00:39:01.157]  So this is a similar system for your body you inject materials into your body that essentially create the equivalent of an operating system and a receiver and you can literally hook everybody up to the cloud and that includes Hooking them up in a way that their transaction system.
[00:39:01.177 --> 00:39:07.482]  You know the Bible calls it the mark of the beast is one way people know this up, but you're you're basically talking about
[00:39:08.277 --> 00:39:14.639]  Being able to digitally identify and track people in connection with their financial transactions.
[00:39:14.659 --> 00:39:19.560]  So it's a world of zero privacy.
[00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:36.965]  But more importantly, what's important to understand is if you then institute one or more central bank cryptos, you're now talking about a system where every central bank in the world can shut you off individually from transacting if they don't like the way you're behaving.
[00:39:37.925 --> 00:39:41.187]  So many people are familiar with the social credit system in China.
[00:39:41.207 --> 00:39:42.428]  It's very similar.
[00:39:43.069 --> 00:39:53.896]  You're basically, if you install the smart grid in their car, their community, and now literally in their body, you've got 24-7 surveillance.
[00:39:53.956 --> 00:39:56.457]  And if people don't do what you say and behave the way you want,
[00:39:57.609 --> 00:40:03.051]  We're digitizing everything, but it includes the human body as well, and the human mind.
[00:40:19.998 --> 00:40:36.141]  So this system comes with complete control, not only of your ability to transact financially, which is hooked up to your body, but very sophisticated mind control technology through the media and those cloud connections.
[00:40:36.621 --> 00:40:41.082]  So basically you're talking about hooking up into the Borg, if you will.
[00:40:42.743 --> 00:40:46.143]  And so transhumanism, technocracy go hand in hand.
[00:40:46.183 --> 00:40:48.584]  Now, I would describe this as a slavery system.
[00:40:49.591 --> 00:40:58.768]  So we're talking about shifting out of freedom where we have freedom to roam and freedom to say what we want into a complete control system 24-7, including mind control.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:17.094]  Now, the challenge before us is if the, you know, sort of the committee that runs the world, my nickname being Mr. Global, if Mr. Global wants to go to a slavery system and we want to remain a human civilization, then we have a fundamental disagreement.
[00:41:17.674 --> 00:41:19.436]  And that is the disagreement before us.
[00:41:22.619 --> 00:41:26.362]  And we get to the, uh, the diagrams here.
[00:41:26.382 --> 00:41:26.983]  Okay.
[00:41:27.671 --> 00:41:35.718]  So if you look at what's going on, we have the tech people building the clouds and the telecommunications.
[00:41:36.599 --> 00:41:42.465]  We have the military doing space and Operation Warp Speed.
[00:41:42.485 --> 00:41:43.926]  So they're putting up the satellites.
[00:41:45.347 --> 00:41:48.910]  Then we have Big Pharma, which is making the injections.
[00:41:49.631 --> 00:41:49.831]  Thank you.
[00:42:03.704 --> 00:42:04.564]  For what purpose?
[00:42:31.331 --> 00:42:33.013]  To institute the slavery system.
[00:42:33.674 --> 00:42:48.353]  So in other words, if I am going to do everything through a smart grid, and I need to run the smart grid into your neighborhood, and then I need to run the smart grid into your body, the question is, how am I going to build it out in your neighborhood and build it on your body without you seeing the trap?
[00:42:50.765 --> 00:42:54.726]  Right, so that's why you try and keep these different lines separate.
[00:42:54.746 --> 00:43:02.169]  So if you listen to the financial bankers, they try as hard as they can to stay away from these conversations.
[00:43:02.929 --> 00:43:11.552]  So it was interesting, I was watching an IMF presentation on cross-border payments and the Federal Reserve Chairman, the head of the IMF, mentioned the digital
[00:43:12.372 --> 00:43:14.773]  We've been put in a trap this year?
[00:43:42.071 --> 00:43:42.271]  Yes.
[00:43:44.395 --> 00:43:45.717]  Right, but the door hasn't shut.
[00:43:47.741 --> 00:43:53.089]  So that's why the reason we're talking is because transparency can blow the game.
[00:43:54.284 --> 00:44:12.388]  It's interesting because in the beginning of the year when I wrote the article, Injection Fraud, and said Bill Gates is trying to download an operating system in your body just the way you download it in your mind and use virus as an excuse to have to update it, you know, to make it work for his back door every day.
[00:44:13.789 --> 00:44:21.097]  Three months later, and then Corbett did a great series on Gates, and several people came out and sort of reaffirmed this.
[00:44:21.898 --> 00:44:32.870]  And it was in the fall, Yahoo Finance published a poll saying that 44% of Republicans thought Bill Gates wanted to chip them.
[00:44:33.490 --> 00:44:35.392]  And I said, OK, we're making progress.
[00:44:37.532 --> 00:44:55.408]  So, uh, you know, and that's exactly when Gates sort of disappeared and they brought out Operation Warp Speed because they needed, um, and interestingly enough, the person they chose to run Operation Warp Speed was an expert on, uh, injectable brain machine interface.
[00:44:57.510 --> 00:45:03.315]  He used to head research at GlaxoSmithKline and, and he's a brain machine interface expert.
[00:45:05.097 --> 00:45:06.819]  It's a creepy resume for that job, huh?
[00:45:07.179 --> 00:45:08.700]  It's a perfect resume for that job.
[00:45:09.221 --> 00:45:29.058]  You know, here's one of the most important developments that happened in 2019, in addition to the approval of the Going Direct plan by the central bankers and Jackson Hole, was the issuance by the Department of Defense of the Jedi Cloud contract to Microsoft.
[00:45:30.467 --> 00:45:36.950]  So you had Amazon receive, Amazon is essentially a CIA and intelligence agency contractor.
[00:45:37.631 --> 00:45:51.078]  They started generating a profit when they entered into major contracts with the CIA to provide the clouds, not only for the CIA, but all 17 US intelligence agencies through that umbrella cloud contract.
[00:45:51.618 --> 00:45:54.820]  So you now have Amazon running the intelligence agencies contract.
[00:45:55.444 --> 00:46:05.549]  This year, LATOS did a big contract, or at the end of 2019, LATOS did a big contract with the Navy, and then DoD did the JEDI contract.
[00:46:05.589 --> 00:46:13.753]  And so those three huge cloud contracts give you the ability, once you get everybody hooked up into them, to radically re-engineer how the
[00:46:15.737 --> 00:46:16.217]  How's that going?
[00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:53.365]  Technology gives you the ability to institute a complete control system and further centralized economic and political control.
[00:46:54.046 --> 00:46:55.507]  So I'll give you a perfect example.
[00:46:56.427 --> 00:47:02.271]  The reason the African American slave trade ended, there were two reasons in my opinion.
[00:47:03.471 --> 00:47:05.873]  One is you couldn't perfect collaterals.
[00:47:05.993 --> 00:47:13.077]  So the banks in London kept losing money because the plantation owners, when the commodities market went down,
[00:47:13.735 --> 00:47:14.055]  What's that?
[00:47:34.326 --> 00:47:36.587]  Because they had no way of perfecting collateral.
[00:47:37.968 --> 00:47:40.029]  So that was number one.
[00:47:40.049 --> 00:47:48.292]  The second was the Haitians rebelled and the Europeans sent several armies in to try and quell the rebellion and never could.
[00:47:48.852 --> 00:47:49.973]  The Haitians were too good.
[00:47:51.474 --> 00:47:54.895]  Now, if you look at digital technology, you can perfect the collateral.
[00:47:56.616 --> 00:48:03.839]  And with space weaponry and the kind of weaponry you have from space and surveillance, you can put down any rebellion.
[00:48:04.724 --> 00:48:04.964]  Right?
[00:48:06.024 --> 00:48:14.726]  So the reasons that the slave trade, which was unbelievably profitable, the history of the world is slavery is the most profitable business.
[00:48:14.766 --> 00:48:16.987]  It's more profitable than mining.
[00:48:17.087 --> 00:48:20.948]  It's more profitable than, um, than narcotics.
[00:48:21.408 --> 00:48:23.989]  I mean, it's, it's more profitable than all the addictions.
[00:48:24.889 --> 00:48:29.970]  So if you now have the technological capability of implementing slavery,
[00:48:33.356 --> 00:48:36.278]  Their attitude, I think, is, okay, let's do it.
[00:48:37.378 --> 00:48:37.619]  Right?
[00:48:38.159 --> 00:48:47.044]  And part of it is technology also makes it much easier for a small group of people to get together and be very powerful.
[00:48:47.104 --> 00:48:54.389]  So for example, if they bring in breakthrough energy technology, the danger is a small group of crazy people can weaponize it.
[00:48:55.409 --> 00:48:57.210]  So technology is powerful.
[00:48:57.250 --> 00:49:02.173]  The more powerful technology you integrate, the more danger there is, you lose control.
[00:49:02.854 --> 00:49:02.974]  Now,
[00:49:03.544 --> 00:49:07.265]  There are other theories as to why people would want complete control.
[00:49:07.906 --> 00:49:26.313]  So for, I'll give you another reason, you know, given the difficulty of feeding and managing a population that's getting ever larger, if you now have biotechnology that allows Mr. Global to live for 150 years, you know, you can't afford, you can't keep that secret, right?
[00:49:27.173 --> 00:49:31.055]  If, if the, if the wealthier lives, living for 150 years and we're not,
[00:49:32.847 --> 00:49:34.548]  That you can't keep that a secret.
[00:49:35.369 --> 00:49:47.197]  So why not downsize the population, integrate robots, use robotics for everything, and you can have a very wealthy and luxurious life without all the management headaches, right?
[00:49:48.998 --> 00:50:00.886]  So the kind of breaking of society into different classes or into an uber class and a vast peasantry mixed with robotics?
[00:50:01.587 --> 00:50:01.787]  Yes.
[00:50:02.668 --> 00:50:02.928]  Yeah.
[00:50:02.988 --> 00:50:22.437]  In other words, what I think what's trying, what's trying to happen here is Mr. Global is using technology to move to a system where between robotics, AI and software, a few people can control the many with far less headaches and fear.
[00:50:23.057 --> 00:50:26.879]  You have to remember Mr. Global is very, very afraid of the general population.
[00:50:28.129 --> 00:50:28.591]  Their fear.
[00:50:28.992 --> 00:50:32.924]  Yeah, they're very afraid because if you've been keeping
[00:50:34.505 --> 00:50:41.751]  You know, several times I'm told the leadership in the United States has gotten together to discuss, how can we undo the secrecy?
[00:50:42.032 --> 00:50:45.194]  And each time they come to the conclusion, it's impossible.
[00:50:45.775 --> 00:50:50.939]  You can't undo the secrecy because the liabilities are too enormous.
[00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:59.367]  So if you're the swamp and you're guilty of all the different things the swamp is guilty of, and you try and open
[00:51:00.970 --> 00:51:05.151]  The window on the secrecy, you run tremendous risks.
[00:51:06.431 --> 00:51:07.271]  Tremendous risks.
[00:51:07.391 --> 00:51:17.034]  So you're afraid of the general population and the history of governance is, you know, the general population occasionally does turn and kill the leadership.
[00:51:19.434 --> 00:51:23.295]  So the 325 million people in America, they're more guns.
[00:51:25.322 --> 00:51:40.849]  So, you know, my guess, the reason Jay Powell was backpedaling when the head of the IMF was talking about digital identities is he's sitting there knowing he's got 325 million people and more, and a lot of them have guns and they don't have a lockdown yet.
[00:51:42.590 --> 00:51:46.631]  This is why the second amendment is such a fractious issue.
[00:51:47.152 --> 00:51:54.595]  Most people around the world don't understand why people in America are so rabid about owning guns.
[00:51:55.687 --> 00:52:00.931]  You know so if I can institute total mind control which is what the system is you know guns aren't that dangerous to me, but You know the leadership is
[00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:16.944]  To do what they want to do, it would be very, very convenient if they could bring in the guns.
[00:52:17.224 --> 00:52:21.787]  And you'll see if the Democrats win this election, that's the first thing they're going to try and do.
[00:52:22.788 --> 00:52:27.632]  After making everybody wear face diapers, they're going to try and bring in the guns.
[00:52:28.813 --> 00:52:32.356]  And this is why the Republicans holding the Senate has been such a big issue.
[00:52:33.497 --> 00:52:33.717]  Yeah.
[00:52:33.937 --> 00:52:36.479]  Because they can't do it if the Republicans hold the Senate.
[00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:38.621]  The election is such a mess, huh?
[00:52:40.126 --> 00:52:50.772]  So here's the thing I want to try and tell everybody, you know, because I, I grew up in Philadelphia and my first boyfriend's father was a ward leader who used to go out with a roll of cash and buy all the votes every election.
[00:52:51.473 --> 00:52:54.294]  So, you know, there's an old tradition in America, voting fraud.
[00:52:54.334 --> 00:53:00.798]  And what I tell everybody is neither one of these candidates would have been the candidate without the voting fraud to begin with.
[00:53:00.878 --> 00:53:05.661]  So, you know, we're in a funny position, but I've never seen the voting fraud as blatant.
[00:53:06.894 --> 00:53:14.058]  And I think to a certain extent, you know, it's interesting, they could not have stopped a Trump landslide without COVID-19.
[00:53:14.238 --> 00:53:27.025]  So one question I have is how much of the, because I thought they would do this after the election, how much of the timing of the healthcare op is basically designed to make sure they don't get a populist president?
[00:53:27.405 --> 00:53:28.566]  Not that Trump isn't.
[00:53:29.226 --> 00:53:42.496]  You know, it's hard for me to think of Donald Trump as a populist because he's very much on board for the pro-centralization team, but he's, as Michael Moore has said, he's the American people's way of saying F you to the, to the leadership.
[00:53:43.176 --> 00:53:47.399]  So I think it was very important to them to get rid of Trump, which they're trying to do.
[00:53:47.459 --> 00:53:48.200]  The problem is.
[00:53:49.426 --> 00:53:57.668]  They've used massive voter fraud to do it, but they've used the fraud in a way that it's obvious that the fraud is off the charts.
[00:53:58.248 --> 00:54:10.631]  And it's almost as though they're turning to the population, which they're trying to turn into a cult, saying, you have to pretend this guy is the president, even though you know he's not.
[00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:23.391]  So, you know, we have a fake virus and a magic virus and a fake president and a magic political system and it's, you know, it really is getting very cult-like.
[00:54:23.871 --> 00:54:25.273]  It's the only thing I can say.
[00:54:25.293 --> 00:54:31.339]  Yeah, it's almost like a switch is flicked this year and we're in Bizarro World, right?
[00:54:34.272 --> 00:54:35.913]  So we've been in a bizarre world.
[00:54:36.413 --> 00:54:41.656]  From the minute they started to steal the money, we moved into a bizarre world.
[00:54:41.777 --> 00:55:00.128]  And I think, you know, the only difference is now, as they moved all the money and the official reality moved away from reality even further and further, you know, that's part and parcel of the secrecy, many people thought they could stay on the middle of the road.
[00:55:01.048 --> 00:55:06.790]  And now what's clear is, you know, you have to go with the cult or you have to go with truth.
[00:55:07.731 --> 00:55:09.731]  The middle of the road is going away.
[00:55:11.232 --> 00:55:13.633]  And so everybody has to choose which they want.
[00:55:15.754 --> 00:55:16.614]  Let's go to the riots.
[00:55:18.735 --> 00:55:24.097]  Okay, so when the riots began and the leadership took the position that
[00:55:25.290 --> 00:55:31.776]  You couldn't go to church because of the danger of the magic virus, but you could go to the riots and protests.
[00:55:33.657 --> 00:55:36.159]  My team and I started to look at the riots.
[00:55:36.940 --> 00:55:45.688]  And so we first, we made, if you come into Soleri, there's a database called COVID-19 and I think it's COVID-19 riots and fed.
[00:55:46.408 --> 00:55:48.650]  So the first thing we did is we looked at the state.
[00:55:49.856 --> 00:55:57.848]  And we looked at the cities and whether the governor was Democrat or Republican, and then what the COVID cases and deaths were.
[00:55:59.170 --> 00:56:05.238]  And then we said, okay, we're going to check a box called riots, where riots have been.
[00:56:06.263 --> 00:56:15.809]  So we started to look at the patterns of the riots vis-a-vis the political machine control and sort of the COVID magic virus op.
[00:56:16.630 --> 00:56:20.352]  And there was something wrong when I was looking at the data.
[00:56:21.253 --> 00:56:22.414]  I'm a very intuitive person.
[00:56:22.434 --> 00:56:23.955]  I was saying, there's something, there's something here.
[00:56:24.695 --> 00:56:28.978]  So I said to the wonderful teammate who was building this, I said, do me a favor.
[00:56:29.098 --> 00:56:34.622]  I want you to put a box called the Federal Reserve, and I want you to check the box.
[00:56:36.018 --> 00:56:42.504]  They're 12 banks, one headquarters and then the branches for a total of 37 locations.
[00:56:43.325 --> 00:56:50.271]  I want you to check the box wherever in any city where we have a branch or a bank or the headquarters.
[00:56:50.291 --> 00:56:51.392]  I want a check.
[00:56:52.540 --> 00:56:58.545]  And what we discovered is 34 of the 37 bank locations have riots.
[00:56:58.565 --> 00:57:00.286]  And I said, well, wait a minute, that's a pattern.
[00:57:01.327 --> 00:57:02.248]  There's something here.
[00:57:02.588 --> 00:57:03.569]  Let's drill down.
[00:57:04.330 --> 00:57:15.879]  So we started with Minneapolis and we said, let's take the data of all the buildings that were harmed or burnt, or businesses, and we'll map it.
[00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:21.404]  You know, we'll do a GIS software and we'll map where these businesses were.
[00:57:22.071 --> 00:57:24.832]  And how close they were to the Federal Reserve Bank.
[00:57:26.253 --> 00:57:31.796]  And so, the first one we did, there's a street going across Minneapolis called Lake.
[00:57:33.997 --> 00:57:34.958]  And we mapped them.
[00:57:35.338 --> 00:57:41.141]  And one of the things we did when we mapped them was we drew pictures of where the opportunity zones were.
[00:57:41.161 --> 00:57:44.543]  Do you know what an opportunity zone is?
[00:57:45.717 --> 00:57:57.466]  An Opportunity Zone is a tax shelter mechanism created in 2018 to help the tech billionaires, as they sold their stock, avoid capital gains.
[00:57:57.887 --> 00:58:13.059]  So you can, if you're Jeff Bezos, who sold $10 billion of stock this year, if you were to roll over your proceeds into Opportunity Zone investments and handle it in a certain way, you could avoid all capital gains tax.
[00:58:14.628 --> 00:58:17.249]  So this is fantastically profitable.
[00:58:17.869 --> 00:58:34.892]  Now, if you look at the riots, when I first saw how all the buildings and businesses destroyed along Lake Street were right at the bottom of the opportunity, I started to laugh and I said, you know, I was assistant secretary of housing.
[00:58:34.952 --> 00:58:36.373]  That's not a riot pattern.
[00:58:36.393 --> 00:58:38.313]  That's a real estate acquisition plan.
[00:58:39.833 --> 00:58:41.434]  So what are you saying?
[00:58:41.614 --> 00:58:44.236]  It's to cheapen the prices in the city?
[00:58:44.416 --> 00:58:56.684]  So I have a thriving series of small businesses, a lot owned by African American and Hispanics along a particular boulevard in the Opportunity Zone.
[00:58:57.845 --> 00:59:01.788]  If first I declare the businesses non-essential and shut them down, right?
[00:59:02.729 --> 00:59:03.489]  Magic virus.
[00:59:04.029 --> 00:59:05.751]  So first I declare them non-essential.
[00:59:05.811 --> 00:59:07.752]  So now they're in real trouble, right?
[00:59:08.490 --> 00:59:09.810]  Because they can't do their business.
[00:59:10.731 --> 00:59:13.611]  And then I have riots and burn and damage them.
[00:59:15.012 --> 00:59:15.232]  Right?
[00:59:15.752 --> 00:59:18.773]  If I was really clever, I pulled their insurance right before I did it.
[00:59:18.973 --> 00:59:21.074]  I don't know what the case was, but we'll see.
[00:59:22.354 --> 00:59:24.174]  So now their business is shut down.
[00:59:25.015 --> 00:59:27.495]  They're now hung on their debt, right?
[00:59:27.555 --> 00:59:29.896]  Whether their mortgage or their credit card.
[00:59:30.656 --> 00:59:33.077]  But even worse, now their building has been damaged.
[00:59:33.197 --> 00:59:36.478]  And of course, insurance doesn't cover all the repairs and fixing, right?
[00:59:37.603 --> 00:59:43.864]  So needless to say, it's going to be a lot easier and cheaper for me to go in and buy up all those buildings, right?
[00:59:45.765 --> 00:59:46.285]  Voila!
[00:59:47.185 --> 00:59:48.745]  It's called disaster capitalism.
[00:59:49.866 --> 00:59:57.547]  So we then mapped, we did Minneapolis, then we mapped Kenosha, then Portland, and now we're doing a place in Ohio.
[00:59:58.327 --> 01:00:05.029]  And the patterns we're seeing, if you look at the clusters of where the damage is, just speaking as Assistant Secretary of Housing,
[01:00:06.218 --> 01:00:17.664]  Those are, in my opinion, real estate acquisition plans completely, you know, especially when they come on top of declaring all those small businesses not essential and shutting them down or restricting them.
[01:00:18.184 --> 01:00:20.205]  You know, I'm sure you've got a lot of restaurants in there.
[01:00:21.126 --> 01:00:21.346]  Yeah.
[01:00:21.766 --> 01:00:29.730]  So, for example, if you look at San Francisco, 49% of the businesses in San Francisco are expected to be out of business by the end of the year.
[01:00:31.591 --> 01:00:34.472]  Do you know how much real estate you're going to be able to pick up cheap on this?
[01:00:35.253 --> 01:00:35.853]  It's phenomenal.
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:43.802]  Now, when you realize that if they sell their tech stocks high, they can pick it up really cheap.
[01:00:43.922 --> 01:00:49.505]  What's important to understand is this makes the economics of building the smart grid out in the Fed cities.
[01:00:49.545 --> 01:00:54.587]  Remember I said 34 of 37 cities have a Fed bank or branch.
[01:00:55.247 --> 01:01:03.791]  So this makes building out the smart grid around the Fed banks much cheaper, which I'm assuming you want to do if you're going to come out with a crypto system.
[01:01:06.610 --> 01:01:06.910]  Okay.
[01:01:08.271 --> 01:01:08.611]  Okay.
[01:01:08.631 --> 01:01:20.598]  So Mr. Global is now coming to the point where... Can you explain who's Mr. Global?
[01:01:20.678 --> 01:01:20.878]  Yes.
[01:01:20.958 --> 01:01:23.760]  So Mr. Global is my nickname for the committee that runs the world.
[01:01:23.820 --> 01:01:31.464]  The defining characteristic of life on planet Earth is our real global governance system is a mystery.
[01:01:32.879 --> 01:01:34.020]  And think about it.
[01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:34.841]  It's phenomenal.
[01:01:34.881 --> 01:01:40.926]  We live on a planet and we don't demand to know how our governance system really works.
[01:01:42.130 --> 01:01:43.450]  But instead it's a secret.
[01:01:43.491 --> 01:01:50.913]  So, you know, I have a lot of high octane conjectures, Dr. Fair would say, about who and what that is, but for now we'll call it Mr. Global.
[01:01:50.953 --> 01:01:54.234]  So Mr. Global is now implementing robotics.
[01:01:54.274 --> 01:01:59.836]  That's one of the new technologies that's really starting to make an enormous difference.
[01:02:00.677 --> 01:02:01.477]  Can you label that?
[01:02:01.917 --> 01:02:05.639]  Okay, so here's our robot and here's our human.
[01:02:06.879 --> 01:02:09.100]  And of course the question for Mr. Global is,
[01:02:10.526 --> 01:02:12.728]  You know, which is more efficient doing what?
[01:02:12.868 --> 01:02:27.522]  In other words, if I'm supposed to manage the planet and all the natural resources and harvest it to my benefit and make sure my risk is reduced, how much do I want to use robots for and how much do I want to do humans for?
[01:02:28.243 --> 01:02:33.207]  Now, the brilliance of hooking everybody into the cloud with a cryptosystem
[01:02:35.109 --> 01:02:35.389]  Yes.
[01:02:58.099 --> 01:03:04.162]  I can take every company, completely automate it with software and robotics, and fire all the humans.
[01:03:04.202 --> 01:03:05.162]  We don't need them anymore.
[01:03:06.123 --> 01:03:08.924]  I've never talked to anybody who didn't understand the Riot part.
[01:03:09.444 --> 01:03:13.906]  Because that's a very typical old game.
[01:03:16.807 --> 01:03:18.108]  Especially in poor neighborhoods.
[01:03:18.688 --> 01:03:19.108]  Yeah, right?
[01:03:19.489 --> 01:03:19.769]  Yeah.
[01:03:21.349 --> 01:03:21.749]  Okay, so...
[01:03:23.322 --> 01:03:24.482]  Do you want me to continue with this?
[01:03:25.062 --> 01:03:28.963]  So we have the Mr. Global at the top.
[01:03:29.824 --> 01:03:35.705]  We have the database and software systems using artificial intelligence.
[01:03:36.325 --> 01:03:43.987]  A very important part of this now is the satellite system that's being put up in the orbital platform.
[01:03:44.787 --> 01:03:50.588]  And using telecommunications and digital technology, you have the ability 24-7 to track and monitor
[01:03:53.482 --> 01:03:55.143]  Both your humans and your robots.
[01:03:56.344 --> 01:03:59.666]  And the question for Mr. Global is, what's more efficient?
[01:04:00.266 --> 01:04:05.069]  If I can do everything with robots, then what do I do with the humans?
[01:04:05.109 --> 01:04:06.110]  I don't need them anymore.
[01:04:07.971 --> 01:04:11.353]  So are we seeing, Bill, the kind of human farming or something?
[01:04:13.494 --> 01:04:15.876]  So they would describe it as resource management.
[01:04:15.956 --> 01:04:21.179]  And if you look at the technocracy and the writing about technocracy, so many of us describe we're moving from a
[01:04:22.381 --> 01:04:25.122]  You know, whatever systems we use now, to a technocracy.
[01:04:25.142 --> 01:04:31.503]  In a technocracy, you have two different visions of the world.
[01:04:31.663 --> 01:04:38.025]  My vision of the world is that humans are sovereign individuals whose freedom comes by divine authority.
[01:04:38.105 --> 01:04:44.546]  That is what the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution all revolve around.
[01:04:45.187 --> 01:04:46.087]  The image of
[01:04:49.104 --> 01:04:49.544]  Thank you.
[01:05:02.978 --> 01:05:10.982]  So they're not a sovereign individual, they're labor, and they are either more efficient or less efficient than a robot at different functions.
[01:05:11.582 --> 01:05:21.727]  In other words, what I'm saying is Mr. Global views the human race like livestock, not someone with which they share empathy.
[01:05:21.967 --> 01:05:26.589]  And, you know, they don't view us as the same species as them.
[01:05:29.614 --> 01:05:37.697]  And in fact, with a lot of the biotechnology, they figure they're going to live much longer lives than we do and live very differently than we do.
[01:05:40.138 --> 01:05:48.462]  So there's been a real one of the challenges with the secrecy as one group becomes more and more technologically advanced.
[01:05:49.457 --> 01:05:54.479]  They separate culturally, legally, financially from all the other groups.
[01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:59.962]  In other words, they have literally broken away and created a separate civilization.
[01:06:00.962 --> 01:06:04.544]  They don't think of themselves as part of our civilization anymore.
[01:06:04.564 --> 01:06:07.225]  And who is they?
[01:06:08.735 --> 01:06:09.916]  Well, that's the great mystery.
[01:06:09.936 --> 01:06:12.439]  And that's why I call this group Mr. Global.
[01:06:13.059 --> 01:06:18.705]  And I, you know, my personal experience is with many different people in that group and factions.
[01:06:19.346 --> 01:06:23.310]  But ultimately, I can't tell you who really controls.
[01:06:23.951 --> 01:06:26.273]  What I will tell you is the planet is run by force.
[01:06:26.854 --> 01:06:29.476]  And so ultimately, the question is, who is the
[01:06:30.711 --> 01:06:32.152]  Who is the most powerful gun?
[01:06:32.813 --> 01:06:34.194]  And that comes down to space.
[01:06:34.494 --> 01:06:39.959]  Who has the most powerful space presence, space weapons, as well as who controls the sea lanes?
[01:06:41.013 --> 01:06:46.236]  So traditionally, control behind the reserve currency came from control of the sea lanes.
[01:06:46.896 --> 01:06:53.680]  But then as we've moved into space, it's now become control of both the sea lanes and the satellite lanes.
[01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:57.662]  And the question is, who controls what and who has what weapons?
[01:06:58.262 --> 01:07:01.324]  One of the reasons you've seen a very interesting discussion in the
[01:07:01.984 --> 01:07:26.966]  United States for the last two years is Trump has been Very verbal about space force and what is possible in space and he'll make these allusions to our magical weapons in space At which point the generals look at him very disapproving like don't talk about that So the answer is we don't know We don't know what we do know is part of the competition right now between China and America is that
[01:07:29.537 --> 01:07:34.839]  The player who has the most dominant position in space has the power to control the whole planet.
[01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:52.164]  So the Chinese have a system called the social credit system, and they're very much tying their financial transactions and different abilities to travel and do other things to your behavior.
[01:07:53.164 --> 01:07:58.846]  And we've seen different TV shows talk about these kinds of systems.
[01:07:59.707 --> 01:08:16.324]  But you're talking about a world where, and we see it in China, where most people are under 24 seven surveillance and then their financial incentives and their financial powers relate to how well behaved they are.
[01:08:17.345 --> 01:08:23.512]  And I would describe it essentially as a slavery system because there's no personal freedom.
[01:08:24.893 --> 01:08:31.357]  So, to a certain extent, what technocracy will do is move us to a similar kind of system as the Chinese social credit system.
[01:08:33.878 --> 01:08:36.960]  Where if you misbehave, you can be punished.
[01:08:37.780 --> 01:08:45.705]  Right, so, you know, so in theory, you have to get a certain kind of job to make a certain kind of money.
[01:08:45.725 --> 01:08:50.108]  In the current system, in the new system, you have to
[01:08:51.429 --> 01:09:01.035]  Uh, work for a certain kind of company and achieve a certain kind of prominence to be allowed to, to move more than 10 miles from your home or to be allowed to fly.
[01:09:01.055 --> 01:09:13.143]  So there'll be a pecking order that relates to your freedoms to either travel or roam, um, or how much sort of access you have to resources.
[01:09:13.903 --> 01:09:15.284]  So how much money you can make.
[01:09:16.445 --> 01:09:35.161]  But remember, you're going into a system where if they believe they can automate everything with robotic software and AI, it's going to be that much harder for you to share in the benefits and the wealth of the system because the central group can extract so much more.
[01:09:35.181 --> 01:09:39.024]  In other words, they have a one-way mirror.
[01:09:39.085 --> 01:09:40.666]  They can see everything you do.
[01:09:41.427 --> 01:09:43.008]  You can't even see who they are.
[01:09:46.331 --> 01:09:46.591]  Yeah.
[01:09:47.932 --> 01:09:48.252]  Okay.
[01:09:50.653 --> 01:10:10.182]  What's very important to understand about what is happening is that the majority of people have been, if we're talking about a transhumanist system or, you know, in short, a slavery system, most of us have been supporting it and financing it and building it.
[01:10:11.543 --> 01:10:14.304]  So when I look at all the big pharma executives,
[01:10:15.396 --> 01:10:19.839]  Why are they building a system where their own children or grandchildren will be slaves?
[01:10:21.900 --> 01:10:23.841]  Why are the central banks doing it?
[01:10:24.061 --> 01:10:34.147]  Why did they think, you know, there's a theory in America for many years, among the sort of money classes, that if I make enough money, I can get a waiver.
[01:10:34.307 --> 01:10:35.368]  I can get out of it.
[01:10:35.548 --> 01:10:42.112]  I can eat organic food, not eat the GMOs and my grandkids, you know, won't have to take vaccines.
[01:10:44.409 --> 01:10:51.994]  But if you look at who's implementing all these different activities, you know, we're building our own slavery system.
[01:10:52.094 --> 01:10:54.515]  And that means we have the power to stop.
[01:10:55.456 --> 01:10:59.418]  In other words, we don't have to finance the companies that are doing this.
[01:10:59.518 --> 01:11:02.000]  We don't have to work for the companies that are doing this.
[01:11:02.540 --> 01:11:08.704]  And in fact, we don't even have to pay our taxes because the government is breaking all the laws related to financial management.
[01:11:09.004 --> 01:11:10.805]  We have the ability to hold them accountable.
[01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:16.683]  So we're building the prison and we're financing the prison and that gives us the power to stop.
[01:11:17.824 --> 01:11:21.086]  And that's why it's so important that we see where the system is going.
[01:11:22.466 --> 01:11:24.688]  There will be no exceptions.
[01:11:26.429 --> 01:11:27.509]  So what is the solution?
[01:11:28.710 --> 01:11:36.594]  Solution is, number one, bring transparency to what's happening, understand where the system is going, and then stop building it.
[01:11:37.175 --> 01:11:41.137]  You know, if you work for Big Pharma and you're building this, stop.
[01:11:41.701 --> 01:11:46.782]  You know, go find something else to do, like build local fresh food systems so you will have food.
[01:11:49.042 --> 01:11:51.583]  You know, so stop financing it.
[01:11:53.143 --> 01:11:58.364]  Begin the conversation of where this is going, and more importantly, where we want to go.
[01:11:58.924 --> 01:12:07.886]  Because we're going to have to rebuild the economy bottom up if we don't want to be highly centralized.
[01:12:09.338 --> 01:12:11.880]  So this comes down to, you know, I call it coming clean.
[01:12:12.561 --> 01:12:18.526]  Once upon a time I was in Washington, I was writing a check on my JPMorgan Chase private banking account.
[01:12:19.127 --> 01:12:25.593]  And in the meantime, I was engaged in 12 different tracks of litigation, litigating with the people who are trying to engineer the housing bubble.
[01:12:25.613 --> 01:12:28.135]  I was trying to stop the housing bubble from happening.
[01:12:29.256 --> 01:12:34.581]  And I was writing a check on my JPMorgan Chase personal banking account, I realized
[01:12:35.583 --> 01:12:42.287]  Why am I banking at the bank that's doing this criminality, that's destroying communities, that's doing predatory lending?
[01:12:42.767 --> 01:12:44.408]  And I said, you know, I need to come clean.
[01:12:44.468 --> 01:12:45.669]  I need to stop banking there.
[01:12:47.810 --> 01:12:56.715]  So, you know, if tomorrow everybody woke up in America and stopped banking at JPMorgan Chase and said, you know something, y'all are criminals.
[01:12:56.755 --> 01:12:57.876]  We want nothing to do with you.
[01:12:58.496 --> 01:12:58.957]  We're out.
[01:12:59.357 --> 01:13:02.859]  And went to a local credit union or community bank.
[01:13:03.859 --> 01:13:04.840]  It would be a revolution.
[01:13:06.192 --> 01:13:08.353]  It would be a total revolution.
[01:13:08.994 --> 01:13:13.717]  If 20 women turned to big pharma executives and said, you know something?
[01:13:14.097 --> 01:13:14.817]  You're disgusting.
[01:13:15.458 --> 01:13:15.998]  No sex.
[01:13:16.278 --> 01:13:16.598]  Bye.
[01:13:17.159 --> 01:13:17.539]  Out the door.
[01:13:17.559 --> 01:13:19.320]  It'd be a revolution.
[01:13:20.941 --> 01:13:24.844]  So we have the power to change this.
[01:13:25.964 --> 01:13:30.747]  But we're all going to have to come clean because almost all of us are complicit in implementing this.
[01:13:31.468 --> 01:13:31.888]  It's not them.
[01:13:31.908 --> 01:13:32.268]  It's us.
[01:13:34.246 --> 01:13:36.526]  The solution is for every one of us to come clean.
[01:13:37.027 --> 01:13:41.888]  You're either for the transhumanist slavery system or you're for a human system.
[01:13:42.268 --> 01:13:54.070]  But if you're for a human system, then you're going to have to find a way to make money, you know, and engage socially in a human system and stop building a transhumanist system.
[01:13:54.850 --> 01:13:57.091]  Well, the first thing you have to see is you have to get a good map.
[01:13:57.771 --> 01:14:03.852]  In other words, you can't navigate this unless you can see the transhumanist system that is being built and who's building it.
[01:14:04.830 --> 01:14:08.593]  But if you're involved with, so let's go back to the pillars.
[01:14:10.234 --> 01:14:10.534]  Okay?
[01:14:11.695 --> 01:14:14.878]  Don't help the military build Operation Warp Speed.
[01:14:15.598 --> 01:14:15.938]  Okay?
[01:14:16.739 --> 01:14:23.184]  Don't help the tech guys figure out how to inject nanoparticles into your body and hook them up to the cloud.
[01:14:23.884 --> 01:14:26.927]  Don't help Big Pharma, you know, make
[01:14:28.032 --> 01:14:31.753]  Make injections which are poisoning American children to death.
[01:14:32.514 --> 01:14:37.495]  Don't help Big Ag make grow GMO food that is poisoning America to death.
[01:14:38.196 --> 01:14:50.500]  Don't help the government institute corrupt, you know, sort of health crisis regulations that are really disaster capitalism and making the private equity guys and the billionaires rich and on and on and on.
[01:14:51.001 --> 01:14:53.783]  But if you, if you, you know, I'll just be blunt.
[01:14:53.963 --> 01:14:58.225]  Get the state of our currencies and read it and you'll know who's doing this.
[01:14:58.585 --> 01:15:00.627]  I mean, it's pretty obvious who's doing this.
[01:15:13.774 --> 01:15:16.256]  InfoWars, Rob here for InfoWars.com.
[01:15:16.596 --> 01:15:19.538]  And I just had to let you guys know, I would not make it out here
[01:15:20.782 --> 01:15:22.963]  Without my lung cleanse, gotta tell you that right now.
[01:15:23.663 --> 01:15:25.083]  It's real swampy out here.
[01:15:25.103 --> 01:15:26.244]  Let me show you what I'm talking about.
[01:15:26.284 --> 01:15:28.244]  We got this nice, beautiful view of the Capitol.
[01:15:29.104 --> 01:15:33.966]  But, as we turn around and head out the door here, look what we got outside.
[01:15:33.986 --> 01:15:37.527]  Two massive heaters.
[01:15:37.627 --> 01:15:38.127]  Massive.
[01:15:41.561 --> 01:15:42.682]  You can see how loud they are.
[01:15:42.702 --> 01:15:44.223]  All they do is put out exhaust.
[01:15:44.343 --> 01:15:45.464]  All they do is put out gases.
[01:15:45.484 --> 01:15:48.327]  I mean, it's keeping us warm, but at what cost?
[01:15:49.047 --> 01:15:58.075]  So, with all the swampiness in this area, with all the swampiness in D.C., you know, Owen's gotta have a long glance.
[01:16:17.898 --> 01:16:19.119]  This is the American dream.
[01:16:19.559 --> 01:16:22.241]  Independent companies supplying the American people.
[01:16:22.281 --> 01:16:27.985]  Behind me is the 400,000 square foot facility for MyPatriotSupply, one of our biggest supporters.
[01:16:28.465 --> 01:16:30.366]  They have so many Americans working for them.
[01:16:30.667 --> 01:16:34.589]  The food, the products, it's all right here from America, right to your door.
[01:16:34.949 --> 01:16:38.051]  We're not funded by Bill Gates or George Soros, the globalist.
[01:16:38.071 --> 01:16:44.236]  We are funded by you supporting us at InfoWareStore.com with amazing American companies like MyPatriotSupply.
[01:16:44.556 --> 01:16:47.218]  Now again, most companies buy in bulk.
[01:16:48.098 --> 01:16:52.501]  And then they advertise and have a really high price, so they make a profit off that food.
[01:16:52.541 --> 01:16:54.202]  But they don't produce it themselves.
[01:16:54.702 --> 01:16:56.604]  They don't stockpile it fresh.
[01:16:57.184 --> 01:17:01.106]  Almost all of this is coming off the assembly line and what being shipped out in a day or two.
[01:17:01.186 --> 01:17:01.767]  Absolutely.
[01:17:01.807 --> 01:17:04.629]  So this Gaylord right here is going to go back to our kitting team.
[01:17:05.149 --> 01:17:07.350]  By tomorrow, these pouches are going to be inside of buckets.
[01:17:07.550 --> 01:17:09.432]  And the next day, those buckets are going to be out the door.
[01:17:09.732 --> 01:17:11.553]  So Joe, tell us what we're doing right here in the factory.
[01:17:11.653 --> 01:17:13.514]  So this is our shipping station right here, Alex.
[01:17:13.574 --> 01:17:16.935]  And this is actually InfoWars orders that are going out at this very moment.
[01:17:17.235 --> 01:17:19.076]  Like this order right here for Steven.
[01:17:19.096 --> 01:17:20.276]  Steven lives in California.
[01:17:20.316 --> 01:17:24.278]  He's going to get a special autographed pick ticket from Alex Jones.
[01:17:24.378 --> 01:17:25.778]  So I want to thank you for your support.
[01:17:25.818 --> 01:17:27.159]  Plus, you're getting some great storable food.
[01:17:27.239 --> 01:17:28.299]  So I'm your Christmas elf.
[01:17:28.699 --> 01:17:30.780]  A little bit late in the year, but thank you so much for your support, brother.
[01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:35.442]  Yeah, we're shipping products, you know, hundreds of packages per day through our state-of-the-art conveyor system.
[01:17:35.862 --> 01:17:37.463]  This is really the state-of-the-art thing.
[01:17:37.583 --> 01:17:41.145]  I think Amazon is what's comparable to what we do here at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:17:41.585 --> 01:17:42.966]  This is Len from Alabama.
[01:17:43.006 --> 01:17:44.507]  Len ordered for Infowars.com.
[01:17:44.527 --> 01:17:45.788]  Her order is going out this afternoon.
[01:17:45.848 --> 01:17:48.129]  It's going to be on a truck here in the next couple of minutes.
[01:17:48.189 --> 01:17:49.329]  It's going to be on her way to land.
[01:17:49.910 --> 01:17:51.190]  Len from Alabama, we love you.
[01:17:51.210 --> 01:17:52.011]  We appreciate you.
[01:17:52.031 --> 01:17:53.612]  You made the right choice with this affordable food.
[01:17:53.632 --> 01:17:55.012]  This is insurance you can eat.
[01:17:55.393 --> 01:17:56.813]  And when did they put this order in?
[01:17:56.833 --> 01:17:57.814]  I want to see how fast it's going out.
[01:17:58.214 --> 01:18:02.335]  You know, this order was actually put in, I think, two days ago, and it's already going out the door right now.
[01:18:02.375 --> 01:18:07.656]  So, two days ago, fresh food produced, packaged right here in America, the whole nine yards.
[01:18:07.716 --> 01:18:08.896]  This is the American dream.
[01:18:08.916 --> 01:18:15.357]  This is American capitalism bringing us exceptionalism, bringing us more choices, and we thank you for keeping us on the air.
[01:18:15.537 --> 01:18:16.177]  Thank you so much.
[01:18:17.197 --> 01:18:22.698]  I've ordered a lot of high-quality food from you guys over the years, but it just gets better and better tasting, and the selection is so huge.
[01:18:23.118 --> 01:18:24.278]  And I was just walking around here.
[01:18:24.338 --> 01:18:27.359]  How many different variants and products do you have?
[01:18:28.578 --> 01:18:29.898]  We have hundreds of different products.
[01:18:29.959 --> 01:18:35.060]  And you know, when you're talking about food, I mean freeze-dried fruits, freeze-dried vegetables, freeze-dried meats, ready-made meals.
[01:18:35.140 --> 01:18:41.303]  Just the ready-made meals that we have, the ones that come inside of the four-week kit, there's going to be at least 18 different varieties that we offer.
[01:18:41.423 --> 01:18:45.604]  And we keep expanding that as we do more research, as we do more configurations.
[01:18:45.644 --> 01:18:46.925]  We're going to be adding different meals.
[01:18:46.945 --> 01:18:49.326]  Your food was great 12 years ago, but now it's amazing.
[01:18:49.386 --> 01:18:52.667]  Chicken noodle, vegetarian taco, potato, cheese.
[01:18:53.027 --> 01:19:00.473]  Cheesy Broccoli Rice, Brown Sugar Oatmeal, Potato Cheddar, Peanut Butter, Corn Chowder, White Rice, Sugar.
[01:19:00.674 --> 01:19:05.918]  We've got Wheat Honey Bread, Whey Milk, you'll have Traveler Stew, Chicken Noodle.
[01:19:05.978 --> 01:19:06.859]  I like Traveler Stew.
[01:19:07.059 --> 01:19:09.121]  Traveler Stew is one of our more popular ones that we have.
[01:19:09.141 --> 01:19:10.041]  Chicken Noodle, it's excellent.
[01:19:10.322 --> 01:19:15.226]  Yep, I mean we have almost anything that you would eat on a regular basis packaged in the long-term food storage.
[01:19:15.266 --> 01:19:17.808]  They've got everything folks, you've got to check it out at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:19:18.068 --> 01:19:19.109]  The entire selection there.
[01:19:19.389 --> 01:19:23.232]  Literally, within a day or two of your order coming in, it's being shipped out to you.
[01:19:23.573 --> 01:19:26.415]  If it's local, in Utah, it's on those small trucks.
[01:19:26.815 --> 01:19:28.797]  If it's outside Utah, it's on big 18 wheelers.
[01:19:29.197 --> 01:19:33.501]  Again, that's why MyPatriot, with Ready Hour, has become the number one storeable food company in the world.
[01:19:33.701 --> 01:19:38.825]  Because of quality, because of service, because of reliability, and because of good word of mouth.
[01:19:39.106 --> 01:19:42.789]  So I want to thank you all for supporting us and supporting our great supplier, MyPatriot.
[01:19:54.519 --> 01:19:58.387]  Right here in America and it funds the InfoWars.
[01:19:58.427 --> 01:20:00.651]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com today and get prepared.
[01:20:10.017 --> 01:20:13.901]  And welcome back to this January 30th Saturday transmission.
[01:20:13.921 --> 01:20:16.003]  I want to thank the crew for coming in and doing a great job.
[01:20:16.343 --> 01:20:23.330]  I want to thank my old friend Stuart Rhodes, founder of Oath Keepers, recovering lawyer, former Army patriot, and so much more.
[01:20:23.790 --> 01:20:26.813]  And he is here with us, founder of the Oath Keepers, to talk about so much.
[01:20:27.353 --> 01:20:27.754]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:20:28.094 --> 01:20:28.655]  Always a pleasure.
[01:20:28.795 --> 01:20:30.436]  Thanks for coming in so quickly.
[01:20:30.456 --> 01:20:31.677]  I want to ask you to come on a few days ago.
[01:20:31.838 --> 01:20:32.078]  You bet.
[01:20:33.373 --> 01:20:35.054]  You want to talk about hope today, and I want to do that.
[01:20:35.695 --> 01:20:41.740]  And you want to talk about what really happened at the Capitol, and what the globals are planning next, and where we are really historically as a parallel of founders.
[01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:44.862]  We were just talking before we started going on air here.
[01:20:45.843 --> 01:20:48.265]  But I just want to take us back to what I covered earlier, viewers.
[01:20:48.906 --> 01:21:00.295]  How to defeat America's homegrown insurgency, Robert Greener, former CIA Station Chief for Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq Mission, Manager and Director of the CIA's Counterterrorism Center.
[01:21:01.852 --> 01:21:04.154]  So he's talking about us like we're Afghanistan or Iraq.
[01:21:04.174 --> 01:21:05.495]  I mean, this is so dangerous.
[01:21:05.515 --> 01:21:06.536]  This is so treasonous.
[01:21:06.636 --> 01:21:15.283]  And it's over a provocateur capital riot that was much smaller than most NFL championship game riots.
[01:21:15.823 --> 01:21:17.705]  I mean, absolutely insane.
[01:21:18.365 --> 01:21:20.087]  How to defeat America's homegrown insurgency.
[01:21:20.107 --> 01:21:21.468]  And we've got Swallowsville, remember?
[01:21:21.888 --> 01:21:22.989]  He said, we'll get your guns.
[01:21:23.049 --> 01:21:24.810]  We'll use nukes on the American people.
[01:21:26.420 --> 01:21:31.625]  So if you were trying to get the Iraqis to lay down their weapons, you would talk to them nicer than the Democrats do.
[01:21:31.665 --> 01:21:33.207]  I mean, they want a fight.
[01:21:34.008 --> 01:21:34.989]  They're spoiling for it.
[01:21:35.429 --> 01:21:38.432]  We've got Tulsi Gabbard saying this is incredibly dangerous.
[01:21:38.893 --> 01:21:42.697]  Tucker Carlson says the government is at war with the American people.
[01:21:42.737 --> 01:21:46.941]  Former SEC Commissioner compares GameStop squeeze to Capitol riot.
[01:21:47.562 --> 01:21:49.444]  She and other liberals for the people.
[01:21:50.646 --> 01:21:58.290]  Like Elizabeth Warren want to arrest the people that dared stand up to the shorting and did the squeeze on the short.
[01:21:58.550 --> 01:22:04.172]  But here it is like throwing a match, like throwing a match into a tinderbox.
[01:22:04.213 --> 01:22:07.194]  Gabbard slams Pelosi's enemy within the House for remarks.
[01:22:07.634 --> 01:22:13.617]  So that's where we are right now is the deep state that just stole this election.
[01:22:14.337 --> 01:22:16.919]  It's got us on global planetary lockdown run by the UN.
[01:22:18.513 --> 01:22:25.939]  Telling us we're obsolete is now saying if you're populist and you protest even the lockdown, that's in these announcements, you're a terrorist too.
[01:22:26.019 --> 01:22:28.641]  So they bring in the lockdowns, get us used to martial law.
[01:22:28.701 --> 01:22:30.802]  Now they let us know, by the way, it's political.
[01:22:31.643 --> 01:22:37.367]  And they shoot with rubber bullets and, you know, kill people in Germany that go out and protest and blow women's faces off.
[01:22:37.687 --> 01:22:38.608]  That's all fine and dandy.
[01:22:38.628 --> 01:22:43.632]  And it's all unified, whether it's Australia, Germany, UK, Canada, the US, Stuart Rhodes.
[01:22:43.732 --> 01:22:45.153]  What is this we're historically witnessing?
[01:22:45.677 --> 01:22:48.078]  We are witnessing now is a slave revolt.
[01:22:48.738 --> 01:22:54.940]  They want to have a, like you call a prison planet, and correctly, they want a new prison planet with them owning everything.
[01:22:55.300 --> 01:22:58.981]  They just threw down the gauntlet, took the mask off and let you know what they're really about.
[01:22:59.481 --> 01:23:00.742]  And they want you to submit.
[01:23:00.762 --> 01:23:03.122]  So this is this is our put up or shut up moment.
[01:23:03.403 --> 01:23:05.143]  Around the world, people are rebelling.
[01:23:05.463 --> 01:23:07.604]  And of course, all they have is force.
[01:23:08.044 --> 01:23:09.105]  All they have is terror.
[01:23:09.485 --> 01:23:10.406]  All they have is fear.
[01:23:10.466 --> 01:23:13.409]  So that's why I draw a parallel to the Founding Fathers Day.
[01:23:13.610 --> 01:23:15.071]  They were all branded rebels.
[01:23:15.391 --> 01:23:17.073]  They were all branded terrorists.
[01:23:17.313 --> 01:23:22.478]  Patrick Henry was called a terrorist for daring to form militia in Hanover County, Virginia.
[01:23:22.939 --> 01:23:25.801]  And so we're in the same parallel situation they were in.
[01:23:26.042 --> 01:23:27.963]  They were dealing with domestic puppets.
[01:23:28.604 --> 01:23:29.385]  We're good to go.
[01:23:48.746 --> 01:23:49.447]  We're good to go.
[01:24:12.148 --> 01:24:13.329]  Done according to federal law.
[01:24:13.670 --> 01:24:19.095]  And so if you want to volunteer for that, you can go and she's looking for volunteers, looking for whistleblowers and volunteers.
[01:24:19.375 --> 01:24:20.916]  So you fight back, you expose it.
[01:24:21.197 --> 01:24:25.060]  But the American people also need to stand up and do what the founders did.
[01:24:25.341 --> 01:24:37.212]  When General Gage landed in Boston Harbor to take to impose martial law on all of Massachusetts, he read a proclamation from the king declaring that from here forward, all town hall meetings are banned.
[01:24:37.632 --> 01:24:42.934]  They figured we're going to shut the people up, stop town hall meetings, and we can stop the insurrection from brewing.
[01:24:43.455 --> 01:24:46.576]  The Founders thumbed their nose at him and held town hall meetings anyway.
[01:24:46.876 --> 01:24:48.317]  And they did that en masse.
[01:24:48.617 --> 01:24:50.678]  Everybody stood up and defied him.
[01:24:50.898 --> 01:24:53.699]  And he couldn't do anything about it because they were surrounded by militia.
[01:24:54.199 --> 01:24:55.280]  That's the lesson for us.
[01:24:55.560 --> 01:24:56.620]  You've got to come together.
[01:24:56.900 --> 01:24:58.781]  You've got to be strong together.
[01:24:59.101 --> 01:25:01.462]  You've got to declare this regime to be illegitimate.
[01:25:01.722 --> 01:25:09.626]  You've got to declare everything that comes out of King Biden's mouth as illegitimate and null and void from inception because he's not a legitimate president.
[01:25:09.886 --> 01:25:12.627]  And then you must stand together and you must nullify.
[01:25:13.007 --> 01:25:16.689]  When John Adams and Sam Hancock stood up,
[01:25:18.229 --> 01:25:19.730]  John Hancock and Sam Adams stood up.
[01:25:20.190 --> 01:25:26.112]  They did what the founders told us to do, is go and defy, but do it together united.
[01:25:26.392 --> 01:25:27.633]  Make sure you're all together.
[01:25:28.073 --> 01:25:43.259]  And then later on, when Jefferson and Madison were rebelling against or fighting against the Alien and Sedition Act, they told us the states have a duty to interpose themselves, that was in the Kentucky and Virginia resolutions, to interpose themselves and defend the people against any unconstitutional action by the federal government.
[01:25:43.519 --> 01:25:54.464]  So you gotta call on your state legislature to do their job, of course most of them won't because they're part of the problem, but you gotta go back down to the county level and call on your county officials and your county sheriff in particular to do his job to protect you.
[01:25:54.764 --> 01:25:59.767]  Not just refuse to comply and go along with enforcing, but also to step in between.
[01:25:59.787 --> 01:26:00.927]  That's interposition.
[01:26:01.007 --> 01:26:01.888]  And as you said,
[01:26:02.748 --> 01:26:03.049]  I'm good.
[01:26:20.991 --> 01:26:29.016]  As we see demonstrations from California to Michigan, spontaneous, tens of thousands, millions in Europe saying no to the lockdowns, this is all a globalist test.
[01:26:29.036 --> 01:26:36.681]  They're trying to push us into offensive violence so they have an excuse to sell the security apparatus on a dictatorship and a crackdown.
[01:26:36.761 --> 01:26:37.922]  I was talking to folks high level.
[01:26:38.502 --> 01:26:38.582]  Yes.
[01:26:55.374 --> 01:26:56.475]  Is that really their ace card?
[01:26:56.515 --> 01:26:57.815]  And what else should we be looking out for?
[01:26:57.835 --> 01:26:59.416]  Well, that's why you gotta do it locally.
[01:26:59.656 --> 01:27:00.996]  That's why you gotta do what the founders did.
[01:27:01.296 --> 01:27:05.918]  When Gage landed in Boston Harbor and tried to ban all town hall meetings, they didn't attack Boston.
[01:27:05.938 --> 01:27:07.058]  They didn't march on Boston.
[01:27:07.278 --> 01:27:07.998]  They were smart.
[01:27:08.139 --> 01:27:10.219]  They separated themselves out at Concord.
[01:27:10.479 --> 01:27:12.640]  Concord became the new seat of the rebel government.
[01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:14.701]  That's where Hancock and Adams were.
[01:27:14.721 --> 01:27:23.284]  And we already see in Northern California and many other areas, whole towns where there's leadership, no one wears the mask, no one buys it, and oh, soon they're not complying with all the rest of the stuff.
[01:27:23.304 --> 01:27:24.144]  You just stop complying.
[01:27:24.264 --> 01:27:24.424]  Yeah.
[01:27:39.341 --> 01:27:46.445]  They forced him to march an entire battalion of Royal Marines out to try to arrest Hancock and Adams because they were surrounded by militia.
[01:27:46.685 --> 01:27:48.145]  He couldn't do it with secret police.
[01:27:48.165 --> 01:27:50.687]  So that's the lesson of the Founding Fathers.
[01:27:50.727 --> 01:27:54.849]  The same lesson that Solzhenitsyn realized too late in the Gulag.
[01:27:55.649 --> 01:27:55.969]  I don't know.
[01:28:11.958 --> 01:28:13.319]  And it makes the system look bad.
[01:28:13.339 --> 01:28:26.450]  And that was their big victory, is that we had over a million people conservatively for the Trump rally, we're always peaceful, and a few people got manipulated by Q hysteria that, oh, the storm is here, Trump's gonna back you, all of this.
[01:28:26.470 --> 01:28:29.393]  Trump thought he was coming to a demonstration to show people didn't buy the voting.
[01:28:29.793 --> 01:28:34.577]  He was trying to get a 10-day emergency hearings that Ted Cruz was putting forward.
[01:28:34.917 --> 01:28:40.542]  So by storming it, you can see between the velvet robes, you know, a few dozen actually attacked cops, a few hundred that went in didn't.
[01:28:41.102 --> 01:28:42.382]  This is the new Pearl Harbor.
[01:28:43.022 --> 01:28:45.263]  But regardless, this is their pretext.
[01:28:45.323 --> 01:28:48.203]  And now they say, arrest the Game Stoppers, they're rioters too.
[01:28:48.263 --> 01:28:50.804]  So it really shows the desperateness of these people.
[01:28:50.824 --> 01:28:54.665]  But let's go back, not to 260 years ago or whatever.
[01:28:55.585 --> 01:29:00.966]  Let's go back to just January 6th, because you're a smart guy.
[01:29:00.986 --> 01:29:06.727]  You've been a constitutional lawyer, military, you've been healthkeepers for a long time.
[01:29:07.955 --> 01:29:08.736]  This was a setup.
[01:29:08.756 --> 01:29:10.358]  We need to learn from this setup.
[01:29:10.719 --> 01:29:12.481]  A million people, a few hundred go in.
[01:29:12.521 --> 01:29:13.883]  We all get blamed because of them.
[01:29:14.324 --> 01:29:18.409]  The enemy literally grabbed victory from the jaws of defeat against us.
[01:29:18.770 --> 01:29:21.313]  We have to admit that they set us up and had a propaganda victory.
[01:29:21.613 --> 01:29:25.719]  So talk about what happened that day, how it ties into Q, and what you see moving forward.
[01:29:25.959 --> 01:29:29.904]  Well, I think the answer for us is A, put some perspective on it.
[01:29:29.925 --> 01:29:32.588]  I mean, I've watched the film of people walking between the ropes.
[01:29:32.969 --> 01:29:34.711]  That's hardly a storming of anything.
[01:29:34.791 --> 01:29:35.612]  That's not Pearl Harbor?
[01:29:35.632 --> 01:29:37.435]  That's not 3,000 dead from Japanese bombers?
[01:29:37.495 --> 01:29:38.036]  I don't think so.
[01:29:38.156 --> 01:29:39.057]  But Schumer said it is!
[01:29:40.720 --> 01:29:48.966]  So, and hey, when you talk about them creating WACOs, I would say better what you want is Bundy Ranches.
[01:29:49.527 --> 01:29:51.468]  You want a thousand Bundy Ranches across the country.
[01:29:51.488 --> 01:29:55.571]  You want to make sure that you're united and you defend each other when they're trying to oppress people.
[01:29:55.931 --> 01:29:59.214]  Stand up, don't be afraid, but mock and ridicule them.
[01:29:59.234 --> 01:30:02.136]  That's right, the left always says, think global, act local.
[01:30:02.196 --> 01:30:03.617]  We have to take over locally.
[01:30:03.737 --> 01:30:05.258]  Sure, and you stand together.
[01:30:05.638 --> 01:30:07.480]  When someone's being oppressed, you stand with them.
[01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:08.761]  So, look.
[01:30:09.401 --> 01:30:19.331]  In the Founders Day, they ransacked, they sacked Governor Hutchins, the royal governor of Massachusetts, sacked his mansion, threw all his furniture and papers and effects out into the street.
[01:30:19.691 --> 01:30:21.413]  He had to flee and go someplace else.
[01:30:21.653 --> 01:30:24.876]  That was vastly worse than anything that was done at the Capitol by anybody.
[01:30:25.177 --> 01:30:26.438]  So let's put some historic perspective on that.
[01:30:26.458 --> 01:30:27.479]  Yeah, they's a tar and feather people.
[01:30:27.921 --> 01:30:28.141]  Right.
[01:30:28.561 --> 01:30:34.203]  And of course, the FBI did not investigate one single occurrence of anybody from Antifa trying to burn down St.
[01:30:34.223 --> 01:30:36.564]  John's Church, or BLM, trying to burn down St.
[01:30:36.604 --> 01:30:40.805]  John's Church around the corner from the White House, or all the other rampaging throughout Washington, D.C.
[01:30:40.986 --> 01:30:47.928]  There were no billboards all over the place like there are here now in Texas, calling for whistleblowers or witnesses to report people that were at the Capitol.
[01:30:48.268 --> 01:30:52.530]  So, this is all about them trying to demonize and suppress and cause fear.
[01:30:52.630 --> 01:30:56.592]  Why don't we just say no one ransacked anything, because that's what Nadler said.
[01:30:56.612 --> 01:30:57.553]  He said there is no antifa.
[01:30:57.793 --> 01:30:58.013]  Right.
[01:30:58.053 --> 01:30:59.674]  Why don't we just say there is no capital?
[01:31:00.434 --> 01:31:05.417]  I think conservatives need to take a cue from what they do, and you need to protect the people that were arrested.
[01:31:05.437 --> 01:31:07.017]  Whether you agree with them or not, I disagree.
[01:31:07.077 --> 01:31:12.480]  I think there was a mistake to go in there, but you protect them with lawyers, and you do your best to fight for their rights.
[01:31:12.500 --> 01:31:15.282]  Yeah, because Soros and them gave billions for people that shot cops and stuff.
[01:31:15.302 --> 01:31:18.805]  We're not going to give money to people that shoot cops, but, you know, oh my God, you walk through velvet ropes.
[01:31:19.185 --> 01:31:20.346]  You're a, you're a housewife.
[01:31:20.466 --> 01:31:21.887]  Oh my God, you're going to get 20 years in prison.
[01:31:21.927 --> 01:31:25.530]  BS, man, because they can put her in jail for 20 years for walking between velvet ropes.
[01:31:25.770 --> 01:31:26.451]  What are they going to do to you?
[01:31:27.304 --> 01:31:28.024]  Right.
[01:31:28.104 --> 01:31:31.606]  So you have to realize that this is what they're going to do to you no matter what.
[01:31:31.886 --> 01:31:35.527]  If that had never happened, they'd have found some other reason.
[01:31:35.567 --> 01:31:36.348]  Let's pull back, though.
[01:31:36.388 --> 01:31:41.890]  Historically, I know you parallel it to 1776, and it definitely is the same country, same people.
[01:31:42.190 --> 01:31:43.771]  You're damn right.
[01:31:43.811 --> 01:31:47.032]  But what is the foaming at the mouth Pelosi saying?
[01:31:47.052 --> 01:31:48.673]  We have enemies in Congress within.
[01:31:48.693 --> 01:31:49.693]  They must be expelled.
[01:31:50.013 --> 01:31:51.514]  They're trying to kill us.
[01:31:51.534 --> 01:31:52.374]  They're trying to get us.
[01:31:52.814 --> 01:31:55.675]  It makes me think of that Bible verse, the wicked flee when none pursue.
[01:31:57.336 --> 01:32:04.798]  They are literally foaming at the mouth on TV everywhere, so many clips I can't even play them all, saying the CIA and the Army is going to crush us.
[01:32:05.078 --> 01:32:11.020]  New York Times, it's time to occupy and have rendition teams, and to shut down anybody that supports Trump, arrest all Trump supporters.
[01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:15.381]  I mean, that's guaranteed to start a real war, and they're going to lose that.
[01:32:15.421 --> 01:32:23.864]  I mean, I'm not trying to brag here, but the CIA couldn't, you know, they actually lost us the Vietnam War because of how disreputable and out of control they were.
[01:32:24.744 --> 01:32:27.305]  The United States can't win these wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[01:32:27.585 --> 01:32:29.705]  Do you really think they can win a war against 100 million gun owners?
[01:32:29.745 --> 01:32:32.406]  And I don't want that war, but what the hell is the CIA?
[01:32:32.506 --> 01:32:33.706]  Is that who runs this?
[01:32:34.066 --> 01:32:36.967]  What are the leftist bluebloods that run the CIA thinking here, Stuart?
[01:32:36.987 --> 01:32:40.428]  Or do they just have such a hatred for America and such a heart on?
[01:32:40.448 --> 01:32:42.428]  So that's two-part.
[01:32:42.708 --> 01:32:43.349]  What are they doing?
[01:32:43.389 --> 01:32:43.989]  Why are they doing it?
[01:32:44.349 --> 01:32:46.909]  And why is Swallowswell saying, we'll use nukes on you?
[01:32:46.969 --> 01:32:48.270]  I mean, it's just bizarre.
[01:32:48.690 --> 01:32:49.290]  What's their fear?
[01:32:49.750 --> 01:32:53.391]  They fear the people, like Catherine Austen Fitts said in her interview not too long ago.
[01:32:53.971 --> 01:33:03.054]  They have plans for us that they know we'll rebel against, and they're afraid because there's 365 million of us, we outnumber them vastly, and we're armed, we're well-armed.
[01:33:03.394 --> 01:33:05.114]  So they have a problem, and so they're afraid.
[01:33:05.515 --> 01:33:08.395]  And so they only have power, they only have force.
[01:33:08.555 --> 01:33:17.118]  And so they're trying to use that power and that force, A, to decapitate leadership, those they perceive as leadership, and B, to cower everybody else, make them all afraid.
[01:33:17.318 --> 01:33:20.381]  They're projecting onto us their own cowardice.
[01:33:20.481 --> 01:33:24.824]  They would never stand up and put their lives at risk, and so they don't think we will either.
[01:33:24.844 --> 01:33:26.926]  A lot of them probably believe they can suppress us.
[01:33:27.186 --> 01:33:28.287]  This is not Russia.
[01:33:28.307 --> 01:33:29.528]  This is not China.
[01:33:29.829 --> 01:33:30.709]  We are different.
[01:33:30.929 --> 01:33:32.231]  So there's going to be resistance.
[01:33:32.251 --> 01:33:34.753]  The only question is, is what will be the spark?
[01:33:35.153 --> 01:33:36.174]  And so they keep pushing.
[01:33:36.194 --> 01:33:40.658]  That's why it's important for us, like Mike Vanderbilt said, the late leader, late founder,
[01:33:41.158 --> 01:33:42.159]  Well, that's why the founders had militia.
[01:34:09.392 --> 01:34:15.838]  So they had the Sons of Liberty, where they were secret freedom fighters, and they also had open public militias made up of every able-bodied man in the town.
[01:34:16.199 --> 01:34:22.565]  And what the advantage of that is, is that the list of all of the patriots becomes useless, because you're all standing together in the militia.
[01:34:22.585 --> 01:34:23.646]  They already know who you are.
[01:34:23.666 --> 01:34:24.967]  You're not going to be able to hide from them.
[01:34:25.067 --> 01:34:26.269]  Our phones are tracking devices.
[01:34:26.489 --> 01:34:27.750]  They know exactly who we are.
[01:34:27.770 --> 01:34:30.012]  Yeah, they're just trying to get us to cow and say we're bad guys.
[01:34:30.172 --> 01:34:31.614]  When they're the globalists, they're the foreign power.
[01:34:34.721 --> 01:34:36.362]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've studied history.
[01:34:36.522 --> 01:34:37.863]  I've interviewed all the experts.
[01:34:38.383 --> 01:34:40.165]  I have looked at every facet of this.
[01:34:40.285 --> 01:34:45.928]  And now, only days until the inauguration of the CHICOM agent, it's all coming into place.
[01:34:46.209 --> 01:34:48.210]  That's how they changed the subject from election fraud.
[01:34:48.410 --> 01:34:50.632]  It's how they changed the subject from Hunter's laptop.
[01:34:50.812 --> 01:34:56.756]  It's how they changed the subject from Epstein and Obama and Al Qaeda and the New World Order.
[01:34:57.156 --> 01:35:01.359]  And now use the already martial law in place for COVID-19.
[01:35:01.379 --> 01:35:04.481]  And that's what it is to then be expanded and become political.
[01:35:05.402 --> 01:35:06.222]  And become permanent.
[01:35:06.722 --> 01:35:07.963]  They train you to stay in your houses.
[01:35:07.983 --> 01:35:08.984]  They train you to be tracked.
[01:35:09.284 --> 01:35:10.265]  They train you to do what you're told.
[01:35:10.745 --> 01:35:12.287]  For nine, ten months as training wheels.
[01:35:12.427 --> 01:35:13.748]  And now they launch the storm.
[01:35:14.188 --> 01:35:16.149]  The storm is here.
[01:35:16.370 --> 01:35:17.450]  It's a globalist storm.
[01:35:18.111 --> 01:35:19.712]  There's not going to be martial law for Trump.
[01:35:20.192 --> 01:35:22.054]  There's going to be martial law for the globalist.
[01:35:22.394 --> 01:35:23.555]  They're trying to set you up.
[01:35:23.755 --> 01:35:25.256]  Don't be involved in violence.
[01:35:25.617 --> 01:35:26.877]  Expose the New World Order.
[01:35:27.098 --> 01:35:29.019]  And expose the takeover with information.
[01:35:29.299 --> 01:35:30.460]  That's how we beat these people.
[01:35:30.680 --> 01:35:31.261]  With truth.
[01:35:31.821 --> 01:35:33.383]  And again, you see this Q idiocy.
[01:35:33.403 --> 01:35:38.648]  We're going to talk more about in a moment how dangerous it is and new permutations of it in China, new permutations of it in Europe.
[01:35:38.708 --> 01:35:41.871]  It's really spreading and it fits into classical disinformation.
[01:35:42.772 --> 01:35:46.115]  Oh my God, military intelligence, as if military intelligence knows more than everybody.
[01:35:46.155 --> 01:35:47.356]  Well, yeah, there are some smart people in there.
[01:35:47.376 --> 01:35:49.538]  I was talking to a high-level person in the Pentagon this morning.
[01:35:50.376 --> 01:35:51.596]  And I said, what's going on with this?
[01:35:51.977 --> 01:35:53.177]  And I said in the New York Times article.
[01:35:53.637 --> 01:35:55.358]  And he said, Biden knows he stole the election.
[01:35:55.398 --> 01:35:56.218]  He knows they're losing.
[01:35:56.278 --> 01:35:57.838]  He knows that they're in trouble.
[01:35:57.878 --> 01:35:59.159]  He knows the investigations are here.
[01:35:59.559 --> 01:36:03.380]  So they want to start a kinetic conflict to have a pretext to bring in real martial law.
[01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:04.800]  It's that simple.
[01:36:04.860 --> 01:36:10.422]  And they tried to control and trick the Q people into going out and thinking they're part of a secret mission.
[01:36:10.722 --> 01:36:11.643]  And the storm was here.
[01:36:11.943 --> 01:36:13.563]  Thank God it fizzled out and wasn't big.
[01:36:13.603 --> 01:36:14.543]  We were talking before the show.
[01:36:14.583 --> 01:36:15.144]  You agreed with me.
[01:36:15.424 --> 01:36:16.044]  Can you speak to that?
[01:36:16.804 --> 01:36:26.631]  Sure, so I think Q has been a long-term, very successful sign off to call a lullaby, make people believe that magic's about to happen, everything's going to be okay.
[01:36:27.031 --> 01:36:32.235]  And of course, because they believe that, they're easy to manipulate in doing whatever they're told to do.
[01:36:32.595 --> 01:36:34.216]  And so, and we see that now in China.
[01:36:34.236 --> 01:36:44.223]  It's actually a Q version in Taiwan and China that claims that the Chinese dictatorship's about ready to collapse and that the Taiwanese government is going to go into China and become the provisional government of China.
[01:36:44.423 --> 01:36:45.584]  So everybody is like, oh,
[01:36:46.384 --> 01:36:47.445]  It's all about to be over.
[01:36:47.485 --> 01:36:48.767]  The Chinese are about to be defeated.
[01:36:49.067 --> 01:36:50.308]  It's the exact opposite.
[01:36:50.668 --> 01:36:53.531]  Mainland China, Communist China, is getting ready to invade Taiwan.
[01:36:53.711 --> 01:36:57.595]  And they're going to use the uprising that this Cube Movement causes to actually invade.
[01:36:57.895 --> 01:37:01.298]  They're playing the same card the globalists are here, because it's that same central brain.
[01:37:01.499 --> 01:37:10.908]  It's like Operation Trust in the old Soviet Union in 1922-26, where the government poses the opposition to an overthrow of the Bolsheviks to actually identify the opposition.
[01:37:12.598 --> 01:37:19.521]  Sure, and that's why you need to make sure that in your own neighborhoods, your own town, your own county, you come together with locals.
[01:37:19.561 --> 01:37:23.503]  Yeah, not some nebulous 8chan deal with scammers running it.
[01:37:23.743 --> 01:37:26.204]  I mean, give me a break for globalist intel.
[01:37:26.604 --> 01:37:28.425]  You literally, it's very, very simple.
[01:37:29.245 --> 01:37:30.125]  You know you're good.
[01:37:30.165 --> 01:37:31.026]  You know your neighbors are.
[01:37:31.086 --> 01:37:31.846]  You know the Bill of Rights.
[01:37:31.866 --> 01:37:32.586]  You know the Constitution.
[01:37:32.626 --> 01:37:33.767]  You mobilize local.
[01:37:34.107 --> 01:37:36.068]  You're not sticking your hand on a rattlesnake hole.
[01:37:36.348 --> 01:37:37.748]  You're operating out in the open.
[01:37:37.788 --> 01:37:38.989]  That's how good guys operate.
[01:37:39.488 --> 01:37:43.031]  Well, I mean, certainly you can have your plans A, B, C, and D for yourself.
[01:37:43.051 --> 01:37:44.172]  Oh, you can have your private stuff.
[01:37:44.212 --> 01:37:45.213]  Exactly, I'm saying.
[01:37:45.613 --> 01:37:49.657]  So, but publicly, and I would advocate right now that you be very careful.
[01:37:49.697 --> 01:37:51.098]  We're in a period of lawfare.
[01:37:51.458 --> 01:37:55.122]  Make sure that you don't cross the lines legally, but you're also preparing.
[01:37:55.482 --> 01:37:56.943]  You're coming together and becoming stronger.
[01:37:57.323 --> 01:37:59.986]  And you nullify and you resist together.
[01:38:00.406 --> 01:38:02.628]  And when they come for you, you defend each other and yourselves.
[01:38:02.948 --> 01:38:04.690]  You do got to be ready for that moment.
[01:38:04.990 --> 01:38:07.092]  It's going to be your Lexington Green moment.
[01:38:07.632 --> 01:38:10.754]  We don't know where it's going to be in the United States, but at some point... I agree, but let's break that down.
[01:38:10.774 --> 01:38:12.276]  We were just talking about Q. Explain.
[01:38:12.876 --> 01:38:16.879]  They've already gone into Taiwan, or they're going into Hong Kong, now Taiwan.
[01:38:16.899 --> 01:38:17.739]  They're threatening to invade.
[01:38:18.180 --> 01:38:20.862]  And then they put out, oh no, the opposition's unstoppable.
[01:38:21.182 --> 01:38:22.023]  We're going to win.
[01:38:22.463 --> 01:38:26.566]  Contact this shadowy message board the Communist Chinese let operate.
[01:38:26.626 --> 01:38:27.707]  It's Chinese intelligence.
[01:38:28.047 --> 01:38:35.092]  And literally now they're finding out who the opposition is, so they can even direct you to a place in time to then have their provocateurs there to set you up.
[01:38:35.572 --> 01:38:36.353]  What happened to the Capitol?
[01:38:37.481 --> 01:38:46.168]  So we see a parallel here in the United States where people are told, hey, if the power goes out and the internet goes down and the phones go down, that's a good sign.
[01:38:46.208 --> 01:38:50.692]  That means they're about ready to round up all the bad guys and stay in your house, don't go out.
[01:38:51.212 --> 01:39:00.300]  And I'm sure that if they start doing roundups, when they do that, the power will go out and the lights will go out and you'll have no phone, no internet, but the QP will be told to sit in your house and wait.
[01:39:00.660 --> 01:39:04.881]  And if you hear of anybody being rounded up, that's a good sign, because that means the bad guys have been rounded up.
[01:39:04.941 --> 01:39:06.662]  And sit in wait because of COVID.
[01:39:06.682 --> 01:39:08.382]  That was the training wheels.
[01:39:08.442 --> 01:39:09.562]  We're not just saying that now.
[01:39:09.623 --> 01:39:10.843]  I said that 10 months ago.
[01:39:10.883 --> 01:39:11.783]  Those are the training wheels.
[01:39:12.463 --> 01:39:13.203]  Stay in your house.
[01:39:13.384 --> 01:39:13.904]  All this stuff.
[01:39:13.924 --> 01:39:16.844]  And I had people, very prominent, call me and go, Alex, the Q thing's real.
[01:39:17.345 --> 01:39:18.865]  Trump's arresting them all during the lockdown.
[01:39:18.885 --> 01:39:19.645]  And I said, no, you watch.
[01:39:19.665 --> 01:39:21.026]  They're going to use this to steal the election from Trump.
[01:39:21.246 --> 01:39:21.686]  Exactly.
[01:39:22.046 --> 01:39:24.447]  And so when you're told to stay in your house, they'll even tell you.
[01:39:24.587 --> 01:39:27.127]  And if a SWAT team comes to your house, that's a good sign, too.
[01:39:27.407 --> 01:39:29.188]  That means they're about to take you to a safe place.
[01:39:29.755 --> 01:39:31.176]  You know, that's how absurd it is.
[01:39:31.677 --> 01:39:32.918]  Q is a psy-op.
[01:39:33.098 --> 01:39:36.282]  Don't believe anything that you hear in the name of Q. I hate to say it.
[01:39:36.302 --> 01:39:39.385]  I know we're going to get a lot of hate mail over this, but it's just the way it is.
[01:39:39.685 --> 01:39:41.527]  Stop believing nonsense and fairytale.
[01:39:41.927 --> 01:39:48.194]  You are in a situation now, it's like a merger between Stalinistic Russia and what the Founding Fathers faced.
[01:39:48.614 --> 01:39:50.316]  The answer, though, is still the same.
[01:39:50.476 --> 01:39:53.259]  That's why Sultan Newton came to the same exact conclusion.
[01:39:53.539 --> 01:39:54.820]  You gotta come together.
[01:39:55.221 --> 01:39:56.442]  There are more of you.
[01:39:56.642 --> 01:40:00.967]  There's no such thing as a secret police force that could ever oppress all of you.
[01:40:01.287 --> 01:40:02.068]  It can't be done.
[01:40:02.548 --> 01:40:06.112]  If you're united, one at a time, they can pick you off at 3 o'clock in the morning.
[01:40:06.572 --> 01:40:08.454]  Stewart, let's talk about solutions.
[01:40:08.474 --> 01:40:09.756]  Let's talk about coming together.
[01:40:10.296 --> 01:40:13.379]  Let us play Kids March on Michigan State Capitol.
[01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:15.321]  Demand return to high school sports.
[01:40:15.842 --> 01:40:16.282]  Meanwhile,
[01:40:20.177 --> 01:40:23.719]  This is absolutely out of control.
[01:40:23.759 --> 01:40:25.140]  The mask is a symbol of slavery.
[01:40:25.180 --> 01:40:26.260]  It's all an overblown hoax.
[01:40:26.881 --> 01:40:29.902]  What is your take on this and how we fight back against the lockdown?
[01:40:29.962 --> 01:40:32.404]  It's always a few months more, a few months more, a few months more.
[01:40:33.507 --> 01:40:35.950]  Let all the big UN people admit, the masks never come off.
[01:40:37.391 --> 01:40:44.259]  Klaus Schwab said at Davos this week, at a meeting, he said, all businesses where you come in proximity are over.
[01:40:44.559 --> 01:40:46.021]  Humans do not come in proximity.
[01:40:46.261 --> 01:40:50.806]  We're all locked in houses, have to get a travel pass, they're already doing in New York, to leave your house.
[01:40:51.146 --> 01:40:55.190]  I mean, my God, this isn't the tyranny coming, it's here.
[01:40:55.905 --> 01:40:58.287]  Right, it's the medical 9-11.
[01:40:58.827 --> 01:41:07.634]  It was, you know, they used, like Catherine Austin Fitts said in her interview, I really recommend it, they used 9-11 and the threat of the terrorists out there, and of course that never ends either.
[01:41:07.915 --> 01:41:11.117]  The terrorist threat's always there, it's always an excuse to keep having more and more power.
[01:41:11.457 --> 01:41:18.283]  It's the same way, it's even better though, it's an invisible enemy, there can always be a new virus, they can use a real one if they want to, and they can always manufacture a crisis.
[01:41:19.884 --> 01:41:21.225]  The answer, though, is the same.
[01:41:21.465 --> 01:41:25.727]  As I say, I value my freedom enough to be at risk of whatever it is.
[01:41:26.088 --> 01:41:28.889]  I'll be free whether it's risky or not.
[01:41:29.229 --> 01:41:29.890]  I'll be free.
[01:41:30.210 --> 01:41:31.031]  I won't be a slave.
[01:41:31.311 --> 01:41:32.371]  And it takes the same answer.
[01:41:32.491 --> 01:41:33.532]  Mask noncompliance.
[01:41:33.932 --> 01:41:36.554]  So we have to mask noncompliance, too.
[01:41:37.034 --> 01:41:40.275]  We have to make sure that we don't comply, and we need to do it together now.
[01:41:40.295 --> 01:41:42.036]  It's either stand now or kneel forever.
[01:41:42.336 --> 01:41:44.857]  So we have to do the exact same thing the Founding Fathers did.
[01:41:45.097 --> 01:41:49.959]  You thumb your nose at them, you make fun of them, because they're absurd, and the Emperor has no clothes.
[01:41:50.279 --> 01:41:54.441]  He's illegitimate, anything that comes out of his mouth is illegitimate, same goes for your governors.
[01:41:54.481 --> 01:42:02.844]  Governor Abbott, when he decided to step outside the bounds of the Texas Constitution, is as illegitimate as King George was when he asserted absolute power.
[01:42:02.864 --> 01:42:04.325]  Isn't Abbott a disappointment?
[01:42:05.045 --> 01:42:05.646]  I think he's an agent.
[01:42:07.096 --> 01:42:08.237]  I think he's a Chinese agent.
[01:42:08.377 --> 01:42:09.938]  He's been bought out by the Chinese himself.
[01:42:10.558 --> 01:42:14.921]  So it's not like he's some well-intended guy that made mistakes.
[01:42:15.321 --> 01:42:16.321]  I think he's in on the plan.
[01:42:16.702 --> 01:42:17.862]  This is the great reset.
[01:42:17.902 --> 01:42:19.303]  This is the great transfer of wealth.
[01:42:19.523 --> 01:42:26.127]  This is the way to drain what's left of the freedom and the economic independence of the American people to bring us into slavery.
[01:42:26.147 --> 01:42:27.168]  You've got to stand up now.
[01:42:28.509 --> 01:42:29.269]  Really incredible.
[01:42:29.949 --> 01:42:30.670]  Stuart, I want to...
[01:42:32.156 --> 01:42:34.978]  Let's talk about where we're going if we don't start saying no.
[01:42:34.998 --> 01:42:37.539]  It's always, give us a little more, a little more, a little more.
[01:42:37.579 --> 01:42:40.941]  I mean, this is locked up in our houses, we're non-essential, we go bankrupt, forced inoculations.
[01:42:41.221 --> 01:42:43.562]  It's not us warning about this now, it's here.
[01:42:56.189 --> 01:42:56.409]  Right.
[01:42:56.810 --> 01:42:58.331]  And so what they were afraid of is the people.
[01:42:58.351 --> 01:43:11.925]  If Trump's like a surfer, all he did is erode a populist wave of Americans waking up and going, hey, wait a second, you are sacrificing our country for the benefit of every other country on the planet, and especially the Chinese.
[01:43:12.125 --> 01:43:13.086]  We're going to fight back.
[01:43:13.106 --> 01:43:17.431]  We're going to bring a populist in there who's going to do what we want him to do, which is drain the swamp.
[01:43:17.771 --> 01:43:21.894]  Secure our borders, make America strong again, bring jobs back home, America first.
[01:43:22.554 --> 01:43:24.736]  So really, Trump did not cause that.
[01:43:25.096 --> 01:43:28.098]  He's a side effect of what was already there.
[01:43:28.418 --> 01:43:32.121]  The real enemy of the deep state is we the people, and they know that.
[01:43:32.381 --> 01:43:34.122]  That's why they're trying to crush our economy now.
[01:43:34.362 --> 01:43:36.164]  This is them hitting the panic switch.
[01:43:36.184 --> 01:43:40.587]  They're calling a fire in on their own position, basically, because they're afraid of the people.
[01:43:41.027 --> 01:43:42.468]  So it's so incredibly obvious.
[01:43:42.548 --> 01:43:50.014]  Everyone I know didn't used to get the carbon taxes are only on us to shut us down or the turning off the Keystone Pipeline is to hurt us.
[01:43:50.334 --> 01:43:55.558]  Now they're like, oh my God, China's open for business, but we're having our pipelines closed and we're going bankrupt.
[01:43:55.618 --> 01:43:57.400]  And people are like, wow, I'm under attack.
[01:43:57.440 --> 01:43:59.221]  Yeah, this is economic warfare.
[01:43:59.261 --> 01:44:00.002]  This is serious.
[01:44:00.447 --> 01:44:00.627]  Right.
[01:44:00.847 --> 01:44:02.749]  And that's why it's important for us to have some discipline.
[01:44:03.670 --> 01:44:08.473]  Biden, and he's just a puppet, but that entire cabal is starting to show their true colors.
[01:44:08.934 --> 01:44:13.177]  And like I said last time I talked with you, the most important audience for that is U.S.
[01:44:13.197 --> 01:44:13.677]  military.
[01:44:13.877 --> 01:44:17.800]  Of course, second to that is the American veterans and all of us, you know, all patriots.
[01:44:18.241 --> 01:44:24.225]  But it's incredibly important for us to let him have plenty of rope to hang himself and show his true colors, which is what he's doing now.
[01:44:24.545 --> 01:44:27.147]  He's shutting down American oil and people are like, this makes no sense.
[01:44:27.248 --> 01:44:28.028]  No, it makes perfect sense.
[01:44:28.048 --> 01:44:28.989]  And he's doing it day one.
[01:44:29.309 --> 01:44:29.509]  Right.
[01:44:29.830 --> 01:44:31.411]  And he's going to keep going after it.
[01:44:31.711 --> 01:44:34.193]  In New Mexico, New Mexico is a microcosm of this plan.
[01:44:34.453 --> 01:44:38.817]  In New Mexico, once the left took over, they killed the oil industry, oil and gas in New Mexico.
[01:44:39.037 --> 01:44:42.460]  And they don't care if it turns their state into an impoverished hellhole.
[01:44:42.740 --> 01:44:47.504]  They don't care because their job is to turn this country into an impoverished hellhole.
[01:44:47.784 --> 01:44:52.268]  Just like they destroy the economies with riots and everything else in the inner city.
[01:44:52.288 --> 01:44:55.811]  Because they're big finance bank back and they want us poor to buy us up.
[01:44:56.091 --> 01:44:56.291]  Right.
[01:44:56.311 --> 01:44:57.332]  It's a very simple equation.
[01:44:57.512 --> 01:44:58.032]  Exactly right.
[01:44:58.052 --> 01:44:59.513]  They want to buy us up with pennies on the dollar.
[01:44:59.533 --> 01:45:00.414]  That's what they do in the cities.
[01:45:00.434 --> 01:45:01.774]  They're not doing it in the entire country.
[01:45:02.034 --> 01:45:03.935]  And yes, part of that is communist China.
[01:45:04.116 --> 01:45:05.776]  The other part of that are the international banks.
[01:45:05.796 --> 01:45:08.518]  Yeah, China's a place the globalists put Mao in and colonized.
[01:45:08.558 --> 01:45:10.359]  That's just a place they've run for 60 plus years.
[01:45:11.059 --> 01:45:11.620]  I mean, that's it.
[01:45:12.120 --> 01:45:13.981]  Literally, they admit China is the model for us.
[01:45:14.406 --> 01:45:14.606]  Right.
[01:45:14.847 --> 01:45:24.620]  So they want to first strip us of our wealth, and eventually they want to depopulate the rural areas, push us all into the cities, and then eventually they'll get rid of you.
[01:45:24.780 --> 01:45:26.662]  And that's all the official UN plan.
[01:45:26.723 --> 01:45:28.986]  And so now folks, it's easier than ever to wake people up.
[01:45:29.006 --> 01:45:30.648]  Stuart, how long ago did you file those papers?
[01:45:30.888 --> 01:45:31.488]  Eleven years ago.
[01:45:31.508 --> 01:45:33.109]  And I didn't even know who you were before then.
[01:45:33.129 --> 01:45:35.250]  I think I interviewed you because you worked for Ron Paul and did a bunch of stuff.
[01:45:35.270 --> 01:45:36.571]  I mean, you've been around a while.
[01:45:36.811 --> 01:45:37.071]  Right.
[01:45:37.111 --> 01:45:38.612]  And so, we both saw what was coming.
[01:45:38.872 --> 01:45:42.874]  And like I used to joke with you about it, it's like being Cassandra in ancient Greek tales.
[01:45:42.894 --> 01:45:43.815]  You could see the future.
[01:45:43.955 --> 01:45:45.276]  You wrote a paper about it at Yale.
[01:45:45.716 --> 01:45:47.377]  I wrote a paper about Indian combatants status at Yale.
[01:45:48.197 --> 01:45:53.141]  But it's like the character Cassandra in Troy, the daughter of King Priam of Troy.
[01:45:53.381 --> 01:45:55.783]  She could see the future, but she was cursed that no one would believe her.
[01:45:56.143 --> 01:45:58.705]  That's how I felt for all these years, but now it's pretty obvious.
[01:45:59.045 --> 01:46:00.526]  Anyone with eyes can see, can see it.
[01:46:00.887 --> 01:46:03.409]  And so unless they're benefiting from it, that's what the problem is.
[01:46:03.429 --> 01:46:05.150]  And tell folks about that legend again, we'll pull it up.
[01:46:05.510 --> 01:46:15.037]  So, what that is, is in Troy, but Troy was taken down, the daughter of King Prime of Troy could see the future, could see her whole family being put to the sword and seeing Troy fall.
[01:46:15.297 --> 01:46:20.660]  But then she told her father she was blessed with the ability of foresight, but she was cursed that no one would believe her.
[01:46:21.121 --> 01:46:25.724]  So she was very frustrated, obviously, because no one would believe her, her family wouldn't believe her, and that's what happened.
[01:46:26.064 --> 01:46:29.149]  And what's frustrating is she was just psychic in the legend.
[01:46:29.409 --> 01:46:30.471]  We have all the documents.
[01:46:30.671 --> 01:46:31.873]  I mean, explain this to people.
[01:46:32.113 --> 01:46:33.114]  This is a plan, folks.
[01:46:33.174 --> 01:46:34.737]  It's going to happen unless we stop it.
[01:46:34.757 --> 01:46:35.297]  I'm getting chills.
[01:46:35.498 --> 01:46:36.940]  Right, but now the mess is coming off.
[01:46:37.641 --> 01:46:40.725]  Because they're afraid of us, because they fear the people,
[01:46:41.366 --> 01:46:43.648]  They're overstepping, they're jumping the shark.
[01:46:44.048 --> 01:46:48.291]  And across the world, people are realizing it's nonsense, that COVID-19 is nonsense.
[01:46:48.511 --> 01:46:50.893]  So now they're trying to control through raw fear.
[01:46:51.233 --> 01:46:56.657]  That's the whole point of the FBI running all over the country and questioning people, even those who weren't even there.
[01:46:56.677 --> 01:46:58.759]  They'll question you if you know someone that was there.
[01:46:59.099 --> 01:47:03.302]  And it's a witch hunt to get you to be afraid to stand up and say anything.
[01:47:03.582 --> 01:47:08.986]  And all of us who are leaders in the Patriot Movement, who were in DC, they want us to shut up.
[01:47:09.246 --> 01:47:12.547]  They want you to be afraid to say certain things and start self-censoring.
[01:47:12.767 --> 01:47:13.568]  That's the whole point.
[01:47:14.148 --> 01:47:16.009]  And a decapitation strike against leadership.
[01:47:16.229 --> 01:47:21.911]  So we have to tell everyone that listens to us is, look, you need to be your own leader in your own town, in your own county.
[01:47:22.151 --> 01:47:23.651]  Come together like Captain Parker.
[01:47:23.952 --> 01:47:26.993]  General Washington didn't tell Captain Parker what to do on April 19, 1775.
[01:47:28.533 --> 01:47:32.355]  He called the shots that day on his hometown green in Lexington.
[01:47:32.375 --> 01:47:35.516]  And I want to explain this to people because I had Matt Brackett, he's a great guy, on.
[01:47:36.578 --> 01:47:39.321]  About a month ago, and he goes, I really like this Epoch Times reporter.
[01:47:39.361 --> 01:47:40.322]  He's doing an incredible job.
[01:47:40.342 --> 01:47:41.403]  I'm like, tell me more about him.
[01:47:41.443 --> 01:47:43.084]  Tell me more because we need more leaders.
[01:47:43.205 --> 01:47:44.766]  And then he goes, I'm sorry, I'm plugging other shows.
[01:47:44.786 --> 01:47:46.908]  And I'm like, Matt, you got it.
[01:47:46.988 --> 01:47:47.829]  I'm not saying Matt's a bad guy.
[01:47:47.849 --> 01:47:48.310]  He's a good guy.
[01:47:48.330 --> 01:47:49.251]  We got to get out of that paradigm.
[01:47:49.891 --> 01:47:50.972]  I want more leaders.
[01:47:51.152 --> 01:47:52.814]  I want other people to be successful.
[01:47:53.194 --> 01:47:56.137]  I love seeing Tucker Carlson get on the right path.
[01:47:56.258 --> 01:47:58.340]  I love seeing all these other new people.
[01:47:59.395 --> 01:48:04.118]  I forget his name, but he's got a show on The Hill TV where he lays stuff out.
[01:48:04.638 --> 01:48:05.439]  This is good.
[01:48:05.519 --> 01:48:15.025]  The answer for our children in the future is that we become mainstream and defeat the globalist mainstream tyranny and that Stewart and I become obsolete.
[01:48:15.485 --> 01:48:17.006]  I mean, Stewart will get killed if he needs to.
[01:48:17.026 --> 01:48:18.007]  He'll go to prison if he needs to.
[01:48:18.307 --> 01:48:20.849]  So will I. So will I. But I don't want to do that.
[01:48:21.309 --> 01:48:22.750]  And so everybody needs to get in their head.
[01:48:22.790 --> 01:48:24.011]  This is not another talk show.
[01:48:24.572 --> 01:48:27.754]  This is not some dude up here who wants the top ratings or I want the biggest paycheck.
[01:48:28.194 --> 01:48:30.176]  I read these documents 30-something years ago.
[01:48:30.336 --> 01:48:31.597]  I got on air 27 years ago.
[01:48:31.937 --> 01:48:32.898]  Stewart's in the same boat.
[01:48:33.218 --> 01:48:35.000]  You can't go back once you read this stuff.
[01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:37.301]  Because I saw them pull this stuff in other countries.
[01:48:37.802 --> 01:48:38.923]  So this is their big plan.
[01:48:39.303 --> 01:48:40.104]  It doesn't get better.
[01:48:40.124 --> 01:48:41.585]  It gets worse until we say no.
[01:48:41.865 --> 01:48:45.007]  And that's why all the hopium and all the lullaby crap is so poisonous.
[01:48:45.308 --> 01:48:47.850]  Because they knew everybody was waking up because of the work you did and we did.
[01:48:48.860 --> 01:48:50.220]  And so they bring in the QOP.
[01:48:50.501 --> 01:48:55.402]  It's a classic operation trust to set everybody up because you're scared when you learn this.
[01:48:55.642 --> 01:48:56.162]  Oh, don't worry.
[01:48:56.202 --> 01:48:57.303]  The military is going to handle it.
[01:48:57.543 --> 01:48:58.303]  There's secret groups.
[01:48:58.363 --> 01:48:59.143]  Everything's OK.
[01:48:59.623 --> 01:49:01.824]  And then the storm is actually the globalist takeover.
[01:49:02.284 --> 01:49:03.785]  So again, I go back to that because.
[01:49:04.636 --> 01:49:07.017]  They're going to bring you more of that.
[01:49:07.197 --> 01:49:14.840]  What did Churchill say when they'd had Dunkirk and the British had been run to the side of the ocean, 200,000 expeditionary force, they'd been routed by the blitzkrieg.
[01:49:15.220 --> 01:49:21.502]  He got up there once Admiral Chamberlain had resigned, he said, all I'm going to offer you is pain, blood, sweat, tears.
[01:49:21.582 --> 01:49:22.302]  But you know what?
[01:49:22.523 --> 01:49:23.723]  It's worse if we don't fight.
[01:49:24.183 --> 01:49:25.924]  And we're never going to, even if they take this island.
[01:49:26.778 --> 01:49:27.739]  America will come save us.
[01:49:56.978 --> 01:50:01.299]  And, of course, Obama considered military action there, but he did not do it.
[01:50:01.339 --> 01:50:01.859]  He blinked.
[01:50:01.879 --> 01:50:04.840]  And the reason why he blinked is, yes, he could have used military action.
[01:50:04.860 --> 01:50:06.901]  Yes, it was the optics of people on their own land being assaulted.
[01:50:07.061 --> 01:50:07.301]  Sure.
[01:50:07.361 --> 01:50:10.321]  Well, he was worried about the loyalty of the troops.
[01:50:10.622 --> 01:50:18.844]  Because every veteran who was at Bundy Ranch, for every one of them, there was a thousand back in their old unit in the Marine Corps or the Army who were watching.
[01:50:19.304 --> 01:50:22.705]  And if they'd have smoked us at Bundy Ranch, they'd have had a rebellion on their hands.
[01:50:22.725 --> 01:50:23.885]  And that's why...
[01:50:24.565 --> 01:50:28.208]  And that's why they're doing loyalty tests and all this with the military now.
[01:50:28.428 --> 01:50:30.850]  They're trying to create the cadres they need for the takeover.
[01:50:30.870 --> 01:50:32.271]  Well, they fear the military.
[01:50:32.811 --> 01:50:33.351]  They fear us.
[01:50:33.371 --> 01:50:33.952]  They fear the military.
[01:50:34.132 --> 01:50:35.253]  They have a real serious problem.
[01:50:35.653 --> 01:50:38.095]  After, what, 20 years of constant warfare?
[01:50:38.335 --> 01:50:42.098]  They have an absolutely massive pool of combat vets who know what they're doing.
[01:50:42.558 --> 01:50:48.664]  You know, so very much like in the Founders Day, they had veterans of the French and Indian War who knew very much what they were about.
[01:50:48.684 --> 01:50:49.685]  Same thing goes here, too.
[01:50:50.045 --> 01:51:05.499]  And they don't have the loyalty of the rank-and-file troops, and the more Biden oversteps, the more he takes off the mask and acts like a dictator, the more of the troops will be aware that he is legitimately a dictator, he's not legitimately the president, and when the time comes, they'll fight on the side of the people.
[01:51:05.879 --> 01:51:06.780]  And that's what you want.
[01:51:06.980 --> 01:51:14.047]  That's why we gotta make sure that we're disciplined, let him show his true colors, but also start to do what the Founders did.
[01:51:14.067 --> 01:51:16.389]  They separated themselves from a corrupt system.
[01:51:16.630 --> 01:51:18.051]  They declared their independence from it.
[01:51:18.331 --> 01:51:22.135]  So we should say, we are still loyal to the Constitution, but they have stepped outside of it.
[01:51:22.335 --> 01:51:29.680]  And when they're outside of the Constitution, it's my duty to declare that to be null and void from inception and to protect those around me from them.
[01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:33.563]  And their sheriffs gotta come together, we gotta unite the warrior class of America.
[01:51:33.603 --> 01:51:42.509]  All the veterans, all the retired cops, all the good ol' boys, all the patriots out there, the gun owners, gotta come together, put aside whatever differences they might have had, and come together as the people.
[01:51:42.529 --> 01:51:46.692]  And that goes inside the cities, that goes in rural and urban, I don't think it's a democratic or republican.
[01:51:46.712 --> 01:51:47.272]  And let's go back to this.
[01:51:47.292 --> 01:51:49.394]  How to defeat America's homegrown insurgency.
[01:51:50.134 --> 01:51:55.037]  If I was the globalist, I would back out and try to have reconciliation and slow the train down.
[01:51:55.477 --> 01:52:01.341]  But because it's a bunch of hedge fund managers and bankers in Europe that mainly run this and Communist China, they don't care if we have a civil war.
[01:52:01.681 --> 01:52:04.563]  They think that will knock America out of superpower status.
[01:52:05.103 --> 01:52:07.185]  And so when I talk to active duty military,
[01:52:08.140 --> 01:52:08.380]  I don't
[01:52:25.094 --> 01:52:25.434]  I don't know.
[01:52:41.297 --> 01:52:42.718]  Get out of this scot-free either.
[01:52:43.118 --> 01:53:02.190]  And so when I, again, see former head of the CIA operations in Afghanistan and Iraq in counterterrorism saying, confirming what Brennan said two weeks ago, confirming what the White House said last Friday, a week before last, eight days ago, they said, we need the CIA to carry out counterterrorism operations against American people.
[01:53:02.331 --> 01:53:06.973]  Well, that's illegal on its face, and it doesn't scare people.
[01:53:07.154 --> 01:53:09.575]  In fact, all it's got is real people in the CIA
[01:53:11.132 --> 01:53:11.832]  About the mutiny.
[01:53:12.133 --> 01:53:13.213]  And I'm not just saying all this.
[01:53:13.253 --> 01:53:14.934]  I mean, this is extremely dangerous.
[01:53:15.334 --> 01:53:16.775]  Well, and that's what we need to encourage.
[01:53:16.815 --> 01:53:22.618]  We need to encourage people to stand up and do their... I mean, the original mission of Oath Keepers was to encourage the current serving to do the right thing.
[01:53:22.718 --> 01:53:24.899]  And A, say no first.
[01:53:25.339 --> 01:53:29.541]  But B, when the time comes, if they must, also to protect the people.
[01:53:29.881 --> 01:53:35.402]  That's why I joke about how David Rockefeller doesn't know how to drive an Abrams tank or fly an F-16.
[01:53:35.662 --> 01:53:36.922]  And that's an important lesson.
[01:53:37.222 --> 01:53:40.543]  So there are still good people inside the military and even in federal law enforcement.
[01:53:40.603 --> 01:53:43.984]  I know people inside DHS who joined after 9-11 for the right reasons.
[01:53:44.004 --> 01:53:47.985]  They joined because they believed they were going to be able to protect their country against terrorists.
[01:53:48.265 --> 01:53:49.445]  So there are good people in there.
[01:53:49.665 --> 01:53:51.045]  And they're aware of what's going on.
[01:53:51.345 --> 01:53:59.407]  The problem is, is if we don't stand up, if we are a bunch of cowards who just cower and do whatever we're told, why should they stick their neck out for us?
[01:53:59.747 --> 01:54:00.047]  That's right.
[01:54:30.208 --> 01:54:31.550]  I'm in competition with our defeat.
[01:54:31.930 --> 01:54:32.992]  I sure as hell don't want that to happen.
[01:54:33.012 --> 01:54:33.993]  That's why I keep harping on it.
[01:54:34.253 --> 01:54:35.375]  Because Q hasn't gone away.
[01:54:35.395 --> 01:54:37.318]  It's still this attitude I see on InfoWars comments.
[01:54:37.758 --> 01:54:39.521]  Oh Jones, it's all taken care of.
[01:54:39.541 --> 01:54:40.542]  The military's on our side.
[01:54:40.883 --> 01:54:41.143]  Really?
[01:54:41.912 --> 01:54:42.192]  Really?
[01:54:42.513 --> 01:54:42.713]  Really?
[01:54:42.733 --> 01:54:45.475]  I've got the military begging me to fight harder because they need our help.
[01:54:45.856 --> 01:54:46.476]  Well, yes and no.
[01:54:46.897 --> 01:54:59.429]  So, the rank and file are on our side, but that letter from the Chairman of Joint Chiefs Staff, signed by all the other Joint Chiefs, declaring that the military needs to get ready to defend the Constitution against all of us, tells you what side they're on.
[01:54:59.929 --> 01:55:00.770]  We're good to go.
[01:55:21.476 --> 01:55:24.679]  Former SEC Commissioner compares GameStop squeeze to Capitol riot.
[01:55:25.300 --> 01:55:31.326]  And you also have Elizabeth Warren saying, arrest the 15-year-old kids that went and stood up to Wall Street and invested their money in wine.
[01:55:31.566 --> 01:55:31.786]  Right.
[01:55:31.846 --> 01:55:32.207]  I mean, wow.
[01:55:32.267 --> 01:55:35.010]  I mean, that just shows you everybody's a terrorist, like Tucker Carlson said.
[01:55:35.390 --> 01:55:37.072]  Everybody's a terrorist except Marxist-Leninist.
[01:55:38.186 --> 01:55:41.649]  Well, it also shows you that Warren is really a tool of Wall Street.
[01:55:41.989 --> 01:55:44.411]  She's not a sincere anti-Wall Street person.
[01:55:44.731 --> 01:55:45.932]  She doesn't reveal what she is.
[01:55:45.972 --> 01:55:52.178]  That's what's so good about this, is you're starting to see people step across the line on one side or the other and show their true colors.
[01:55:52.598 --> 01:55:53.679]  So, like I said last time,
[01:55:54.079 --> 01:55:58.060]  Occupy Wall Street was correct about who runs this country and who owns this country.
[01:55:58.320 --> 01:56:00.961]  It is the 1% of corrupt oligarchs.
[01:56:01.241 --> 01:56:08.424]  They were wrong about their solution, because the solution leads to communist China, which is an oppressive, totalitarian state that's also a form of fascism.
[01:56:08.644 --> 01:56:09.324]  It's corporatism.
[01:56:10.224 --> 01:56:15.889]  Explain that you get Chinese generals, who them and their kids and their grandkids are all billionaires, and they call it communism.
[01:56:15.929 --> 01:56:16.630]  It doesn't exist.
[01:56:16.970 --> 01:56:21.194]  Anytime you centralize power, you've just ended competition and put in an even tinier oligarchy.
[01:56:21.374 --> 01:56:21.975]  Exactly right.
[01:56:22.155 --> 01:56:30.902]  And one of those Chinese generals, in fact, the one that owns all those concentration camps in China, is the guy who bought 180,000 acres in Texas on the border.
[01:56:31.203 --> 01:56:34.065]  He bought 180,000 acres of Texas ranch land on the border.
[01:56:34.085 --> 01:56:34.926]  I want to go show that.
[01:56:34.946 --> 01:56:35.847]  We need to go cover that.
[01:56:36.147 --> 01:56:37.528]  He's the dictator.
[01:56:37.808 --> 01:56:42.530]  He is the Chinese general who runs all the concentration camps under his company in China.
[01:56:43.070 --> 01:56:44.511]  He's a slave labor camp owner.
[01:56:44.611 --> 01:56:44.951]  That's him.
[01:56:45.271 --> 01:56:46.352]  He just bought land in Texas.
[01:56:46.392 --> 01:56:48.813]  Your governor, back to Abbott, he let that happen.
[01:56:49.433 --> 01:56:52.255]  So why is it that Abbott is letting a Chinese dictator?
[01:56:52.275 --> 01:56:55.036]  And for those who don't know, the globalists through China can do all this illegal stuff.
[01:56:55.336 --> 01:56:59.919]  The Confucius Institutes, the colleges, the Georgia governor, they're on Chai Com Payroll.
[01:56:59.939 --> 01:57:00.599]  They don't even hide this.
[01:57:01.161 --> 01:57:06.944]  Right, and so they're snapping up, they're buying land all across the United States on the Mexican side and on the Texas side.
[01:57:07.364 --> 01:57:07.684]  Why?
[01:57:08.384 --> 01:57:09.945]  You Texans need to start paying attention to that.
[01:57:10.746 --> 01:57:15.228]  Man, Abbott is just super bad news because he knows this is all a fraud and he's lockstep.
[01:57:15.588 --> 01:57:18.930]  The word is that masks are never coming off and they're going to do new lockdowns coming soon.
[01:57:19.330 --> 01:57:21.631]  You just nullify him and you need to replace him.
[01:57:22.391 --> 01:57:25.433]  So, you know, people in Texas, they've got provisions of your Constitution.
[01:57:25.453 --> 01:57:28.274]  I'm not an expert on it, but you have the authority.
[01:57:28.614 --> 01:57:29.775]  The people of Texas are sovereign.
[01:57:30.575 --> 01:57:37.098]  So, in fact, there was a case filed in Western Texas, in the Western District of Texas, against all the congressional elections.
[01:57:37.138 --> 01:57:38.159]  I want to plug this email.
[01:57:38.419 --> 01:57:39.880]  That's why they call it the Lone Star State.
[01:57:39.920 --> 01:57:42.621]  Explain, because we entered by treaty into the union.
[01:57:43.004 --> 01:57:44.645]  Right, you guys rebelled against Santa Ana.
[01:57:44.965 --> 01:57:51.650]  It was the Tejanos, the Mexicans here, and the whites who were settlers here, rebelled together against the oppressor Santa Ana.
[01:57:51.851 --> 01:57:59.496]  You became your own country, and now you're dealing with, you know, another Santa Ana, an absurd version of Santa Ana and Biden, and your own governor.
[01:57:59.816 --> 01:58:05.280]  So you got a Governor Abbott acting like Santa Ana, decreeing that you can't do this or that without his permission.
[01:58:05.520 --> 01:58:06.281]  He's a paper tiger.
[01:58:06.521 --> 01:58:07.042]  Ignore him.
[01:58:07.722 --> 01:58:09.023]  Do your, live your lives.
[01:58:09.083 --> 01:58:10.023]  In fact, it's already been done.
[01:58:11.143 --> 01:58:14.845]  What was her name there in the Texas salon in Dallas?
[01:58:15.605 --> 01:58:16.246]  Forgot her name now.
[01:58:16.266 --> 01:58:18.546]  The lady got arrested for... Right, yeah.
[01:58:18.626 --> 01:58:22.388]  So she stood up, we protected her salon, so she did the right thing and stood up against that.
[01:58:22.408 --> 01:58:23.689]  Alright, well talk about solutions.
[01:58:23.769 --> 01:58:25.089]  Oathkeepers.org.
[01:58:25.289 --> 01:58:26.250]  Shelley Luther, that was her name.
[01:58:26.410 --> 01:58:26.550]  Yeah.
[01:58:27.350 --> 01:58:35.832]  So, OathKeepers.org, all we're about is, we have a responsibility as both current serving and former military police, firefighters, first responders.
[01:58:36.232 --> 01:58:37.173]  And that's how I should say it.
[01:58:37.193 --> 01:58:39.113]  They misrepresent, sorry to interrupt, but I wanted to be clear.
[01:58:39.133 --> 01:58:39.313]  Sure.
[01:58:39.853 --> 01:58:42.014]  People in the New York Times and Wall Street Journal are sending me emails.
[01:58:42.034 --> 01:58:46.095]  They go, are you going to disavow OathKeepers now that they're basically terrorists?
[01:58:46.255 --> 01:58:49.896]  Oh, what, because one member went into some velvet robes and got arrested?
[01:58:49.916 --> 01:58:52.396]  Because one member might have done something a little bit stupid?
[01:58:52.416 --> 01:58:53.877]  I mean, give me a break.
[01:58:54.921 --> 01:58:59.304]  When Antifa shoots cops and burns down neighborhoods, they go, Antifa doesn't exist.
[01:58:59.965 --> 01:59:01.226]  So this is insane.
[01:59:01.486 --> 01:59:07.971]  Old Keepers has a long 11-year history of peacefully organizing hundreds of thousands of military and law enforcement to say we're going to follow our oath.
[01:59:08.311 --> 01:59:08.831]  That's good.
[01:59:08.851 --> 01:59:12.854]  They used to teach that until a few decades ago in military civics, in handbooks.
[01:59:13.215 --> 01:59:17.738]  But if you're ordered by your officers or anybody to do something unconstitutional, you don't follow that damn order.
[01:59:17.978 --> 01:59:18.139]  Right.
[01:59:18.479 --> 01:59:21.445]  So explain that you're following a total American tradition.
[01:59:21.465 --> 01:59:23.769]  You've done a great job not being heavily infiltrated.
[01:59:23.789 --> 01:59:24.791]  I know it's almost impossible.
[01:59:25.285 --> 01:59:27.126]  Well, we've had people come in.
[01:59:27.166 --> 01:59:27.846]  We just expect it.
[01:59:27.906 --> 01:59:31.887]  We know that we're going to get confidential informants or even FBI agents coming in and joining us.
[01:59:32.148 --> 01:59:33.428]  Hey, we're not doing anything illegal.
[01:59:33.768 --> 01:59:34.348]  We expect it.
[01:59:34.368 --> 01:59:35.029]  We just deal with it.
[01:59:35.389 --> 01:59:43.632]  But all we're saying is, from day one, is, hey, as we were taught in the Army, when I was in the Army, there's the My Lai Massacre, which is used as an example.
[01:59:43.732 --> 01:59:45.232]  Abu Ghraib is a modern example.
[01:59:45.452 --> 01:59:47.773]  Here are things you just don't do that are violations of the laws of war.
[01:59:48.033 --> 01:59:49.594]  You must refuse those unlawful orders.
[01:59:50.134 --> 01:59:56.619]  And so, like in the case of Myla, you had Warrant Officer Thompson, who stopped the killing of women and children with his gunships.
[01:59:56.940 --> 02:00:02.464]  Then you had, what's his name, Lieutenant Calley, I think his name was, who went ahead and followed those orders.
[02:00:02.704 --> 02:00:04.366]  That's an oath breaker and an oath keeper.
[02:00:04.646 --> 02:00:06.668]  So we use that as an example, and so does the military.
[02:00:06.968 --> 02:00:14.214]  All we're saying is, hey, if you're a police officer or the military, make sure that the orders you're being given here in the United States are constitutional.
[02:00:14.494 --> 02:00:23.738]  Like the gun confiscation orders during Katrina, where they had a rule to be unconstitutional, but we all watched cops, you know, confiscating firearms of people who were just trying to protect themselves.
[02:00:23.838 --> 02:00:27.720]  And let's just be clear, I don't want to kill any cops or any military, and I'm not running a military operation.
[02:00:27.740 --> 02:00:28.500]  No, it's not about that.
[02:00:28.900 --> 02:00:34.543]  But we need to warn them, if they manipulate cadres and start a civil war, that's the worst job you'd ever want.
[02:00:35.063 --> 02:00:35.403]  Oh, sure.
[02:00:36.104 --> 02:00:36.484]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:00:36.564 --> 02:00:37.085]  No, absolutely.
[02:00:37.125 --> 02:00:45.772]  But the first line of defense is, hey, you need to do the right thing, not violate your oath, not violate the Constitution, by simply standing down and saying no.
[02:00:46.072 --> 02:00:47.333]  Which did happen during Katrina.
[02:00:47.553 --> 02:00:54.279]  There was that Joshua May, the start of Joshua May, his entire unit for the Utah National Guard refused to participate in the gun confiscation.
[02:00:54.619 --> 02:00:55.400]  No one knows about it.
[02:00:55.500 --> 02:00:59.323]  And the military started refusing, doctors, the military, to give the anthrax shots for killing people.
[02:00:59.723 --> 02:01:02.265]  So this is American ethics, it's good, it's celebrated.
[02:01:02.385 --> 02:01:02.566]  Sure.
[02:01:03.366 --> 02:01:08.109]  But because they did it all together as a unit, none of them were Article 15, none of them were court-martialed.
[02:01:08.429 --> 02:01:11.371]  So the big army blinked and backed down.
[02:01:11.671 --> 02:01:19.396]  So the lesson for you guys in the military right now is make sure you go talk to your brothers in your unit, and when the time comes, you do it together.
[02:01:19.456 --> 02:01:25.700]  You refuse to follow unconstitutional orders that violate the rights of the people, and you do it together as a block.
[02:01:26.040 --> 02:01:27.722]  Same lesson we learned from the unions, right?
[02:01:27.742 --> 02:01:29.683]  You do it together, not one at a time.
[02:01:30.356 --> 02:01:33.420]  Boy, I tell you, the unions are freaking out now that Joe Biden sold them out day one.
[02:01:34.181 --> 02:01:47.058]  Sure, and so you're seeing, I was watching that interview you did with the Boogaloo guy, and you're starting to see people on the left realize, of course he's a libertarian, but there is someone on the left, white Tulsi Gabbard, I would consider a sincere leftist, more sincere.
[02:01:47.478 --> 02:01:55.542]  Who are starting to realize that this is not about left and right, this is not about social versus capitalism, this is about a new version of monarchy.
[02:01:55.863 --> 02:02:00.485]  These people believe that they are... These bankers and big tech people... The new royalty.
[02:02:00.785 --> 02:02:01.386]  Are the new royalty.
[02:02:01.486 --> 02:02:01.686]  Yeah.
[02:02:02.006 --> 02:02:06.408]  They believe that they were born with spurs on their feet and you were born with saddles on your backs.
[02:02:06.468 --> 02:02:09.390]  To quote Thomas Jefferson about the elites of his day.
[02:02:09.750 --> 02:02:11.691]  This is a new version of the royalty.
[02:02:11.731 --> 02:02:12.151]  It's all it is.
[02:02:12.211 --> 02:02:13.231]  It's the same old stuff.
[02:02:13.431 --> 02:02:14.332]  And so was Stalin.
[02:02:14.352 --> 02:02:15.972]  And so was Chairman Mao.
[02:02:15.992 --> 02:02:17.353]  He was a new king, new emperor.
[02:02:17.593 --> 02:02:18.834]  It's all the same nonsense.
[02:02:19.194 --> 02:02:24.596]  It's the ancient lie that the people can't govern their own lives and need someone.
[02:02:24.616 --> 02:02:31.279]  Oh, it's how the left is obsessed with Putin because, I mean, he is popular, but he basically is a dictator.
[02:02:31.319 --> 02:02:32.179]  They worship him.
[02:02:32.539 --> 02:02:33.699]  Hillary worships him.
[02:02:33.739 --> 02:02:34.720]  They worship Gigi Pink.
[02:02:35.563 --> 02:02:42.987]  Right, so because that's their, they project onto themselves that they're going to be your saviors, and in the end it always ends up in the same thing.
[02:02:43.087 --> 02:02:48.310]  As Orville told us in his Animal Farm book, the pigs take over, right?
[02:02:48.351 --> 02:02:50.112]  And in the end they're living in the farmhouse.
[02:02:50.412 --> 02:02:52.773]  Yeah, well we got four legs good, two legs bad.
[02:02:52.813 --> 02:02:55.855]  By the end, two legs, when pigs have them are good, four legs bad.
[02:02:56.135 --> 02:02:56.835]  Right, exactly.
[02:02:57.075 --> 02:02:59.236]  And all of them are equal, but some are more equal than others.
[02:02:59.596 --> 02:03:01.236]  And so you always end up in a dictatorship.
[02:03:01.496 --> 02:03:09.418]  And of course, the top-level guys in the party have the villas on the Black Sea, have all the mistresses, drive their Mercedes-Benz, all that kind of stuff.
[02:03:09.618 --> 02:03:11.499]  They always live high, live large.
[02:03:11.899 --> 02:03:13.139]  You live in squalor.
[02:03:13.459 --> 02:03:14.940]  You can be killed at any time.
[02:03:15.300 --> 02:03:19.601]  And anywhere along the line, that pecking order from the very top, you can be purged out.
[02:03:19.861 --> 02:03:27.088]  That's a lesson for anybody out there who is sold out, is you need to understand that you're selling your children and grandchildren into absolute slavery.
[02:03:27.308 --> 02:03:29.530]  And when the time comes, you're expendable too.
[02:03:29.770 --> 02:03:34.074]  You can't buy yourself the golden ticket that's going to get you a pass, and you and your children a pass.
[02:03:34.094 --> 02:03:34.374]  That's right.
[02:03:34.394 --> 02:03:36.016]  You're taking some political action here.
[02:03:36.276 --> 02:03:37.377]  Tell us about this latest initiative.
[02:03:37.637 --> 02:03:52.371]  So what this is, is a lawsuit that's challenging, this is done by Texas lawyer Kelly Sorrell, it's challenging every congressional election as being invalid because they're all done through electronic voting and all done through a system that did not comport with federal law, with HABA.
[02:03:52.611 --> 02:03:53.972]  Which is the federal election law.
[02:03:54.332 --> 02:03:55.834]  So I'm not an expert on that, but she is.
[02:03:56.134 --> 02:03:58.936]  So folks can go, they can want to volunteer, you can do two things.
[02:03:59.296 --> 02:04:06.322]  She needs volunteers in every state of the union to help dig up evidence on election fraud in their state to help her do this.
[02:04:06.622 --> 02:04:11.326]  She needs people that can go out there and gather, whether you're former intelligence, an ex-cop, or you're just good at digging.
[02:04:11.666 --> 02:04:17.490]  Just contact her and email her and just say, put your state, like say Tennessee, you know, TN,
[02:04:18.271 --> 02:04:20.451]  Volunteer and email this email.
[02:04:20.731 --> 02:04:32.274]  If you're a whistleblower, someone that knows about, you're a witness or a whistleblower that can expose election fraud in your state, put on their, you know, TN or whatever state you are, and then whistleblower or witness, okay?
[02:04:32.534 --> 02:04:36.955]  And you can email her at ksirellesquireesq at protomail.com.
[02:04:37.055 --> 02:04:38.255]  I think it was on the screen there.
[02:04:38.555 --> 02:04:44.296]  So ksirellesq at protomail.com and she will be happy to talk to you.
[02:04:44.616 --> 02:04:56.349]  And by the way, I think I'm saying no evidence of fraud when there were so many mountains, but in these key six states, they didn't pass a law to allow these new mail-in ballots, and they waived the signatures, they waived the addresses, being on the mail-in ballots.
[02:04:56.369 --> 02:04:57.130]  It's all illegal!
[02:04:57.591 --> 02:05:05.460]  Well, I think her main argument is, is, hey, that's all well and good, but from the threshold, they did not even comply with federal law.
[02:05:05.640 --> 02:05:08.681]  I understand, I'm saying, and now they've got H.R.
[02:05:08.701 --> 02:05:27.647]  1 that will legalize at the federal level this, and you're a constitutional lawyer, formerly one, you've gotten out of it, but, I mean, clearly, it's in the Constitution, it's first to the states, then to the federal government, but they were telling Trump, oh no, the states can't override us, but now they're saying, oh, we're going to pass a law, oh, oh, and they're trying to, now they admit they're going to pack the Supreme Court, and other judiciaries.
[02:05:27.967 --> 02:05:28.227]  Of course.
[02:05:28.347 --> 02:05:29.708]  I mean, this is what Hugo Chavez did.
[02:05:30.988 --> 02:05:37.290]  The more they do that, the more they expose that the emperor has no clothes, that they have no legitimacy, trying to rule through raw power.
[02:05:37.550 --> 02:05:39.610]  So the answer is to not comply.
[02:05:39.910 --> 02:05:44.152]  The answer is to say, we're going to be a clean ballot sanctuary county.
[02:05:44.192 --> 02:05:48.593]  You can do whatever you want in Washington, D.C., but in this county, we're going to have paper ballots.
[02:05:48.793 --> 02:05:49.333]  You don't like it?
[02:05:49.513 --> 02:05:49.793]  Tough.
[02:05:50.393 --> 02:05:51.294]  Come take it.
[02:05:51.674 --> 02:05:52.474]  Come take our ballots!
[02:05:53.220 --> 02:05:53.440]  You know?
[02:05:53.540 --> 02:05:57.404]  And by the way, those will be wildly popular county commissioners and city council people.
[02:05:57.985 --> 02:05:59.406]  And a lot of them are getting elected.
[02:05:59.426 --> 02:06:02.990]  They're so scary that there's a lot of hardcore Congress people that got elected this last round.
[02:06:03.410 --> 02:06:03.610]  Right.
[02:06:03.630 --> 02:06:05.772]  Despite all the fraud, I mean, they are getting scared.
[02:06:05.832 --> 02:06:07.134]  That's why they put a stop to that.
[02:06:07.154 --> 02:06:10.237]  They want to suppress them by accusing them of being terrorists, put them on their heels.
[02:06:10.477 --> 02:06:11.498]  That's into the Trump, right?
[02:06:11.778 --> 02:06:16.640]  The entire time he was there, they put him on his heels, made him defend himself, and not get anything done.
[02:06:16.660 --> 02:06:18.401]  That's what they want to do to all these congressmen.
[02:06:18.581 --> 02:06:22.923]  They want to suppress them, make them shut up, and then down the road, they're going to steal the elections and get rid of them anyway.
[02:06:23.003 --> 02:06:24.984]  And let's close on that, Stuart, with any other points you want to make.
[02:06:25.044 --> 02:06:26.825]  It's always fascinating to have you here, especially in the studio.
[02:06:26.945 --> 02:06:27.505]  I love what you do.
[02:06:27.825 --> 02:06:28.286]  Healthkeepers.org.
[02:06:29.878 --> 02:06:33.482]  We don't just get up here and tell you something positive to tell you something positive.
[02:06:33.502 --> 02:06:35.024]  We're telling you a lot of negative, really scary stuff.
[02:06:35.244 --> 02:06:35.944]  We think you can take it.
[02:06:36.285 --> 02:06:38.227]  And you can make provision for something bad that's happened.
[02:06:38.247 --> 02:06:39.588]  It's like, hey, it's freezing outside.
[02:06:39.608 --> 02:06:40.109]  Put your coat on.
[02:06:40.269 --> 02:06:41.110]  It's not a negative statement.
[02:06:41.310 --> 02:06:41.831]  It's preparatory.
[02:06:41.871 --> 02:06:42.812]  Or, hey, lock your doors.
[02:06:42.832 --> 02:06:43.693]  There's been some crime in the area.
[02:06:44.844 --> 02:06:46.345]  But the globalists are scared.
[02:06:46.765 --> 02:06:48.847]  And you see this GameStop thing come out of nowhere.
[02:06:49.247 --> 02:06:50.688]  There's a lot of ways to skin a cat.
[02:06:51.248 --> 02:06:57.672]  And as the public realizes this is all a fraud, I'm seeing so many Democrats now that like, why did I even support Biden?
[02:06:57.692 --> 02:06:59.273]  Or I didn't support Biden, I supported Trump.
[02:06:59.934 --> 02:07:02.015]  There's a giant awakening happening.
[02:07:02.475 --> 02:07:02.816]  Right now.
[02:07:19.113 --> 02:07:27.999]  I mean, they arrested a guy that made a meme four years ago, joking about online voting as a joke.
[02:07:28.319 --> 02:07:31.642]  And so they arrested him, saying he was trying to disenfranchise black people.
[02:07:31.702 --> 02:07:33.543]  I mean, the Justice Department is crazy.
[02:07:33.882 --> 02:07:41.928]  Yeah, the more they do that, the more illegitimate they become in the eyes of the people, but they will only win if you all sit down in terror and refuse to stand together.
[02:07:42.208 --> 02:07:46.331]  If you step up, it'll be just like Ceausescu when he's taken out of the dictator at the end there, you know?
[02:07:46.671 --> 02:07:51.115]  He was giving all the decrees he wanted to, but his bodyguards turned him into the people and he was done.
[02:07:51.375 --> 02:07:51.955]  Let's talk about this.
[02:07:52.075 --> 02:07:57.700]  Guys, go to YouTube and type in, uh, uh, Ceausescu killed, Ceausescu killed Romania.
[02:07:57.720 --> 02:07:59.101]  I want to show some of that B-roll.
[02:08:00.081 --> 02:08:06.326]  And here's the deal, I don't want a pound of flesh, but these dictators and these oligarchies always follow the same patterns.
[02:08:06.386 --> 02:08:10.129]  And oligarchies are even worse because there's not one guy to get, one guy doing it all.
[02:08:10.189 --> 02:08:10.890]  It's kind of a group.
[02:08:10.950 --> 02:08:16.374]  That's kind of their strength is it's these bureaucrats, it's these bankers, it's the Davos group, it's the CFR.
[02:08:18.234 --> 02:08:20.636]  If you take Ceausescu, they had plenty of power in Romania.
[02:08:21.036 --> 02:08:21.816]  Plenty of coal power.
[02:08:21.896 --> 02:08:30.222]  He chose to not give the main city power most of the time, because he likes seeing his giant palace lit up, and he likes seeing them in the dark.
[02:08:30.542 --> 02:08:37.286]  I mean, there's this instinct to make us poor, and that's what the Great Reset is, that's what the carbon... What is wrong with these people?
[02:08:37.306 --> 02:08:42.650]  Like, I feel good when I see somebody doing well, but a lot of these elitists... The social press.
[02:08:43.777 --> 02:08:44.697]  Yeah, they're sociopaths.
[02:08:44.997 --> 02:08:48.678]  They enjoy the pain, like a serial killer, or a serial rapist, or a torturer.
[02:08:48.978 --> 02:08:51.299]  They enjoy the pain in people's eyes.
[02:08:51.319 --> 02:08:53.580]  They enjoy the power over them, or the child molesters.
[02:08:53.980 --> 02:08:55.100]  So they're sociopaths.
[02:08:55.140 --> 02:08:57.541]  The only joy they get in life is power over others.
[02:08:57.761 --> 02:08:58.441]  Look at Soros.
[02:08:58.721 --> 02:09:00.361]  He enjoys collapsing economies.
[02:09:00.601 --> 02:09:03.002]  He plays with countries like chess pieces, because he enjoys it.
[02:09:03.484 --> 02:09:06.147]  So you get a dictator like that, what other joy does he have in life?
[02:09:06.187 --> 02:09:10.751]  I've seen him, not just talking about working for the Nazis, it was the best time of his life, happy making time.
[02:09:11.211 --> 02:09:15.695]  On 60 Minutes, he talks about when he ruins a country, he goes, I love it, it's exhilarating.
[02:09:16.056 --> 02:09:18.238]  But he's the liberal, he's the good guy.
[02:09:18.258 --> 02:09:19.339]  I mean, how sick is that?
[02:09:19.699 --> 02:09:26.142]  Well, he's manipulated the left by giving them money and buying their politicians and getting them to cheer the destruction of their own country.
[02:09:26.162 --> 02:09:27.222]  That's what's so sad about it.
[02:09:27.482 --> 02:09:28.743]  But many of them are walking away.
[02:09:28.923 --> 02:09:30.163]  The walkaway movement is going to grow.
[02:09:30.183 --> 02:09:31.804]  I think it's going to grow exponentially now.
[02:09:32.044 --> 02:09:37.826]  And what I think is exciting to see is the vote total for Trump from black males.
[02:09:38.286 --> 02:09:38.866]  Over 52% voted for him.
[02:09:40.467 --> 02:09:42.308]  And it goes to show you there's a lot of room there.
[02:09:42.328 --> 02:09:44.809]  And that's what's scared the living hell out of the system is.
[02:09:45.089 --> 02:09:50.291]  The people the system thought they owned, thought they had brainwashed, are the ones bucking it.
[02:09:50.311 --> 02:09:56.233]  So they had the panic button, you know, brrrr, brrrr, there's a panic button, hit the panic button, this is not working anymore, shut down the plant.
[02:09:56.253 --> 02:10:03.056]  Because the plant was, all of you were on the plantation in the Democratic-controlled cities, you all do what you're told and vote for Democrats.
[02:10:03.296 --> 02:10:06.457]  They stopped doing that, walked off the assembly line, and had to shut the plant down.
[02:10:06.857 --> 02:10:07.457]  That's what they did.
[02:10:08.017 --> 02:10:14.919]  But now you've got all these pissed off, disenfranchised blacks and Hispanics who voted for Trump in massive numbers because they realize that he is helping America.
[02:10:15.199 --> 02:10:16.219]  That's why they voted for him.
[02:10:16.499 --> 02:10:17.740]  But now they're all pissed off.
[02:10:17.820 --> 02:10:18.120]  Good.
[02:10:18.380 --> 02:10:18.940]  Bring them in.
[02:10:19.160 --> 02:10:20.120]  Let's all stand together.
[02:10:20.160 --> 02:10:24.081]  That cuts against the lie that you must be racist if you stand up for your own people.
[02:10:24.101 --> 02:10:25.962]  They were successful 15 years ago, 10 years ago.
[02:10:27.932 --> 02:10:31.814]  Tellin' people that don't go to a tea party, they're all racist.
[02:10:31.934 --> 02:10:33.555]  But with Trump, of course it wasn't.
[02:10:33.575 --> 02:10:34.336]  People got embraced.
[02:10:35.076 --> 02:10:37.198]  Probably too much to almost a sickening level if you weren't.
[02:10:37.218 --> 02:10:37.918]  Why they became a tea party?
[02:10:37.938 --> 02:10:39.039]  People wanted to prove that they weren't.
[02:10:39.932 --> 02:10:43.053]  Being embraced by the Trump movement, that broke the back of that lie.
[02:10:43.173 --> 02:10:44.454]  And that back's broken.
[02:10:44.494 --> 02:10:46.054]  That's why they had to bring in martial law.
[02:10:46.154 --> 02:10:47.755]  That's why they had to cheat in the election.
[02:10:47.775 --> 02:10:50.156]  That's why they took the mask off and openly cheated.
[02:10:50.236 --> 02:10:51.216]  Because they had to stop you.
[02:10:51.236 --> 02:10:53.197]  They had to stop Trump as a way to stop you.
[02:10:53.497 --> 02:10:58.199]  And to stop all and disenfranchise all those black and Hispanic voters who had jumped on the Trump train.
[02:10:58.581 --> 02:11:03.385]  Yeah, Owen had the fellow on, I forget his name, it was yesterday, but he's a successful black activist in St.
[02:11:03.405 --> 02:11:06.747]  Louis, and he was just pointing out that they didn't steal this, they took it.
[02:11:07.248 --> 02:11:09.589]  Yeah, they stole it.
[02:11:09.609 --> 02:11:10.810]  I mean, they just took it in front of us.
[02:11:11.351 --> 02:11:11.571]  Sure.
[02:11:12.231 --> 02:11:12.852]  Alright, Stuart.
[02:11:12.892 --> 02:11:18.056]  They didn't sneak it behind you, they grabbed a hold of it and said, this is mine.
[02:11:18.416 --> 02:11:23.019]  So we have to say, actually, no, that still belongs to us, and you can't have it.
[02:11:23.039 --> 02:11:24.521]  So what is the psychology of that?
[02:11:24.541 --> 02:11:25.842]  I mean, having the press secretary
[02:11:26.502 --> 02:11:31.252]  Because if you saw a general that did this professionally, it would still be tyrannical and threatening.
[02:11:31.653 --> 02:11:35.962]  But there's that thing about these leftist wannabe dictatorships, where it's like all these...
[02:11:37.162 --> 02:11:38.923]  We're good to go.
[02:11:58.931 --> 02:12:00.434]  It's like Yosemite Sam or something.
[02:12:00.455 --> 02:12:03.000]  It's like, dude, this is not going to go well.
[02:12:03.160 --> 02:12:04.884]  I mean, you're going to crush us?
[02:12:05.185 --> 02:12:06.147]  You're going to root us out?
[02:12:06.187 --> 02:12:06.889]  You're going to rout us?
[02:12:06.909 --> 02:12:09.153]  I mean, do you think that makes me crap my britches at night, sweetheart?
[02:12:09.980 --> 02:12:12.822]  Yeah, that was a point Mike Vanderbilt made, the founder of the 3%er movement.
[02:12:12.862 --> 02:12:16.044]  He said, look, they project onto us their own cowardice.
[02:12:16.484 --> 02:12:19.146]  They are gutless cowards who will do whatever they're told.
[02:12:19.166 --> 02:12:22.248]  They're puppets of the communist Chinese or the blank bankers.
[02:12:22.468 --> 02:12:23.529]  They've sold their souls.
[02:12:23.809 --> 02:12:28.292]  They don't understand that kind of courage to say no and to stand up no matter what the cost.
[02:12:28.732 --> 02:12:29.552]  We understand that.
[02:12:29.572 --> 02:12:32.573]  Especially all of our guys that are prior military, but not just them.
[02:12:32.953 --> 02:12:35.574]  Just the average patriot out there has more guts than these people have.
[02:12:35.934 --> 02:12:38.535]  So they project onto us their own terror and cowardice.
[02:12:38.815 --> 02:12:41.816]  They think they can cower us by threatening us like that.
[02:12:42.136 --> 02:12:45.197]  All it does is make us go, okay, now we see where you're going.
[02:12:45.277 --> 02:12:50.739]  When they take somebody's job, when they bully somebody's kid, when they ban somebody on the internet, it doesn't make anybody I know roll over.
[02:12:50.999 --> 02:12:51.879]  It makes them more hardcore.
[02:12:52.159 --> 02:12:53.040]  And you've got to stand together.
[02:12:53.060 --> 02:13:01.187]  That's why, no matter, even if you disagree with some of the people that went inside the Capitol in Washington, D.C., you should circle the wagon and say, hey, we're going to defend them.
[02:13:01.207 --> 02:13:03.268]  We don't agree with what they did, but we're going to defend them.
[02:13:03.509 --> 02:13:05.270]  We're going to go ahead and promote their legal defense.
[02:13:05.330 --> 02:13:06.191]  We're going to stand together.
[02:13:06.291 --> 02:13:07.772]  I agree with you because I had a blind spot.
[02:13:07.932 --> 02:13:08.513]  I was there.
[02:13:08.633 --> 02:13:09.934]  We were going to show a million people.
[02:13:09.994 --> 02:13:12.216]  We were going to get Ted Cruz into a 10-day investigation.
[02:13:12.556 --> 02:13:13.397]  That was our mission.
[02:13:13.877 --> 02:13:19.862]  I got pissed that I have a million people, a few provocateurs broke in, and then some folks that wanted to joyride, hey, you know, went in like the
[02:13:20.623 --> 02:13:22.146]  Q Shaman guy, but it's right.
[02:13:22.186 --> 02:13:26.696]  If they can get us to then say, oh yeah, they're bad, then it gets turned on all of us.
[02:13:26.796 --> 02:13:28.079]  No, we have to say, hey.
[02:13:28.700 --> 02:13:31.061]  Your antifa is a thousand times worse, so shut the hell up.
[02:13:31.402 --> 02:13:38.666]  And in the Soviet Union, what would happen to people is they'd be arrested by Stalin or by his agents, and then they'd be in the gulag writing letters to Stalin.
[02:13:38.886 --> 02:13:39.747]  It must be a mistake.
[02:13:39.807 --> 02:13:40.567]  I didn't do anything bad.
[02:13:40.587 --> 02:13:41.568]  I'm not a bad person.
[02:13:41.868 --> 02:13:45.010]  So they had this idea in their head that they could, if only Stalin knew.
[02:13:45.370 --> 02:13:46.471]  If only Stalin knew.
[02:13:47.131 --> 02:13:52.394]  And really Stalin told, I mean Lenin told Stalin when he was first working for him, he said, how many do you want?
[02:13:52.434 --> 02:13:55.036]  He said, as much as you need to fill the slave camps and the mines.
[02:13:55.256 --> 02:13:55.636]  Yeah.
[02:13:55.656 --> 02:13:58.157]  I mean, they're just grabbing a percentage of people for slave labor, dumbass!
[02:13:58.417 --> 02:13:59.257]  They know you're innocent!
[02:13:59.957 --> 02:14:01.978]  Or to set an example and create terror.
[02:14:02.238 --> 02:14:02.958]  That was the whole point.
[02:14:02.998 --> 02:14:03.299]  Exactly.
[02:14:03.579 --> 02:14:11.601]  I mean, terrorism, the word terrorism came out of the reign of terror in France, where the rulers, the revolutionary rulers... The Jacobins.
[02:14:11.641 --> 02:14:12.261]  The Jacobins.
[02:14:12.641 --> 02:14:14.482]  Which is what Lenin modeled himself after.
[02:14:14.662 --> 02:14:14.882]  Right.
[02:14:15.082 --> 02:14:15.903]  They used terror.
[02:14:16.203 --> 02:14:19.887]  So terrorism came as a government tactic over the people.
[02:14:19.947 --> 02:14:23.790]  It terrorized people to make sure that they stayed in their place and be submissive.
[02:14:24.170 --> 02:14:25.211]  So everyone's afraid.
[02:14:25.251 --> 02:14:28.854]  Don't say anything, don't do anything wrong, and then rat out your neighbor also.
[02:14:28.874 --> 02:14:32.177]  Because then if you rat your neighbor, then you're going to be more protected because you're a good guy.
[02:14:32.197 --> 02:14:33.178]  You're ratting your neighbor out.
[02:14:33.458 --> 02:14:35.300]  But then a lot of those people got ratted out next.
[02:14:35.380 --> 02:14:35.820]  Of course.
[02:14:36.021 --> 02:14:36.261]  Yeah.
[02:14:36.721 --> 02:14:37.562]  No one's ever safe.
[02:14:37.862 --> 02:14:39.302]  That's why you have to say no to that.
[02:14:39.362 --> 02:14:40.683]  I'm not going to rat out my neighbor.
[02:14:40.943 --> 02:14:46.746]  You don't turn collaborator and rat out your neighbors and other patriots, and I've already seen that started to happen now.
[02:14:47.146 --> 02:14:52.829]  Anybody who will go and rat out their neighbors, I don't care if you disagree with what they did or not, you don't become a collaborator with the FBI.
[02:14:52.869 --> 02:14:55.030]  If you do, everybody else should just shun that person.
[02:14:55.070 --> 02:14:58.152]  That person is no longer someone you should associate with.
[02:14:58.392 --> 02:14:59.052]  I totally agree.
[02:14:59.092 --> 02:15:04.355]  The only time to call the FBI is if, say, a woman says, I'm going to say you rape me if you don't give me money.
[02:15:04.575 --> 02:15:06.396]  Then you have to call the FBI, and that's how.
[02:15:06.636 --> 02:15:09.218]  Sure, you have to do that, I guess, but I wouldn't trust them to do much.
[02:15:09.238 --> 02:15:09.818]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:15:10.018 --> 02:15:10.358]  I'm just happy.
[02:15:10.418 --> 02:15:18.944]  Or like, if you know that, you know, I mean, let's say you heard, you know, a guy at the bar saying, I'm robbing this bank tomorrow, but I think there's certain things.
[02:15:19.224 --> 02:15:20.745]  I wouldn't call the FBI.
[02:15:21.325 --> 02:15:23.167]  I wouldn't call the FBI for anything.
[02:15:23.207 --> 02:15:24.087]  I call my local sheriff.
[02:15:24.307 --> 02:15:24.667]  Oh, I agree.
[02:15:24.707 --> 02:15:25.228]  I'm just, yeah.
[02:15:25.668 --> 02:15:25.848]  Right.
[02:15:26.108 --> 02:15:29.611]  I mean, they are now revealing themselves to be the KGB of the United States.
[02:15:29.951 --> 02:15:30.531]  That's all they are.
[02:15:30.551 --> 02:15:33.413]  Do you think the average FBI agent likes being that bad of a person?
[02:15:33.533 --> 02:15:36.757]  No, I don't think so, but they, you know, they got the paycheck, they're willing to do it.
[02:15:36.777 --> 02:15:38.479]  So we'll see how many of them resign now.
[02:15:38.660 --> 02:15:39.140]  I hope they do.
[02:15:39.160 --> 02:15:47.090]  I would encourage anybody out there that's an FBI agent, that's a real patriot, to look at the pattern, and this is the last eight years, look at the pattern of what's done.
[02:15:47.972 --> 02:15:55.398]  On the left or the right, what's done with people that are anointed by the deep state and are given a pass, like Black Lives Matter or Antifa.
[02:15:55.418 --> 02:15:57.599]  Or the FBI agent that falsified the emails.
[02:15:58.840 --> 02:15:59.521]  Or Hillary Clinton.
[02:15:59.761 --> 02:16:01.162]  She didn't go to jail.
[02:16:01.542 --> 02:16:02.703]  Same with Hillary.
[02:16:02.723 --> 02:16:10.790]  There are some people that are untouchables, whether they're the useful idiots down here at the bottom or the ones at the very top like Hillary Clinton inside the United States are untouchables.
[02:16:10.830 --> 02:16:12.451]  Final point, Okeepers.org.
[02:16:12.471 --> 02:16:15.053]  Stewart, powerful interview on the Saturday evening with us.
[02:16:16.610 --> 02:16:23.134]  What is your, not a prediction, but gut level, what do you expect to happen or what are different scenarios with Mike?
[02:16:23.354 --> 02:16:25.275]  Because, I mean, this guy can't put a pin in his jacket.
[02:16:25.816 --> 02:16:27.937]  This guy does not know what planet he's on.
[02:16:27.957 --> 02:16:29.578]  He's degenerating very, very quickly.
[02:16:30.046 --> 02:16:33.570]  Well, I mean, he'll be replaced pretty quickly with Kamala, for sure.
[02:16:33.590 --> 02:16:35.411]  I think that's going to happen pretty fast.
[02:16:36.252 --> 02:16:37.353]  But, they're going to go for the guns.
[02:16:37.373 --> 02:16:38.054]  They're already doing that.
[02:16:38.274 --> 02:16:41.177]  The bill they propose right now, I think it's going to pass in some form or another.
[02:16:41.437 --> 02:16:48.024]  But it requires you to go to a psychiatrist, and it requires a psychiatrist to interview your current spouse and any ex-spouse you had.
[02:16:49.085 --> 02:16:51.808]  So that literally makes them judge, jury, and executioner now?
[02:16:52.082 --> 02:16:56.605]  Well, as far as your right to keep and bear arms, it of course makes it very, very easy to red flag you.
[02:16:56.905 --> 02:17:00.987]  But you're going to have to go and beg permission, supposedly, to get a license to even own anything.
[02:17:01.007 --> 02:17:02.008]  By the way, Laura Loomer?
[02:17:02.288 --> 02:17:02.988]  No criminal record.
[02:17:03.028 --> 02:17:04.009]  Now she can't own a gun.
[02:17:04.649 --> 02:17:05.610]  Customs stops her.
[02:17:05.990 --> 02:17:07.571]  She can't get a bank account.
[02:17:07.751 --> 02:17:09.372]  She's even more banned than I am.
[02:17:09.892 --> 02:17:11.393]  But the answer's still mass noncompliance.
[02:17:12.665 --> 02:17:15.608]  So, mass non-compliance, they can pass wherever they want to in D.C.
[02:17:16.089 --> 02:17:18.551]  It's like, hey man, you can pass gas in D.C., I don't care.
[02:17:18.571 --> 02:17:21.214]  You can pass whatever so-called law, pretend legislation.
[02:17:21.234 --> 02:17:22.355]  That's what the founders called it, right?
[02:17:22.375 --> 02:17:28.281]  And again, the model is these 800 plus sanctuary cities where they let child molesters go because they're illegal aliens.
[02:17:28.561 --> 02:17:29.802]  Well, then we don't have to follow their laws either.
[02:17:30.143 --> 02:17:30.343]  Sure.
[02:17:30.763 --> 02:17:43.557]  And the real model is the Founding Fathers, when they nullified and refused to comply with what they call pretend legislation out of Kingdom Parliament, then they raised militias, they circled together, and they defended themselves, and in the end they had to fight.
[02:17:43.577 --> 02:17:45.279]  That's what the same trajectory we're on.
[02:17:45.639 --> 02:17:45.839]  Wow.
[02:17:45.960 --> 02:17:46.680]  Okay, Stuart.
[02:17:46.781 --> 02:17:47.641]  Very powerful interview.
[02:17:47.661 --> 02:17:50.785]  We've got about a minute left here before I go to break it and come back and end the transmission.
[02:17:51.125 --> 02:17:51.626]  Any other points?
[02:17:52.226 --> 02:17:54.768]  I think people need to make sure that you've got at least a year's worth of food.
[02:17:55.128 --> 02:17:56.749]  Start stacking rice and beans deep.
[02:17:57.109 --> 02:18:00.772]  Make sure you've got CB radios, ham radios, the ability to communicate with each other locally.
[02:18:01.012 --> 02:18:03.734]  But more than anything else, you've got to have strong neighborhood watches.
[02:18:04.134 --> 02:18:09.378]  You should have a family safe program where you pledge to watch the families of all your first responders and police locally.
[02:18:09.398 --> 02:18:11.679]  You need to encourage your sheriff to form a posse.
[02:18:11.699 --> 02:18:13.280]  That's your next best thing to militia.
[02:18:13.621 --> 02:18:15.262]  And then if you won't do it, you need a new sheriff.
[02:18:15.622 --> 02:18:16.823]  So get strong locally.
[02:18:17.063 --> 02:18:21.646]  And in the meanwhile, start whatever county you're in, call the county volunteers, Montgomery County volunteers.
[02:18:21.966 --> 02:18:27.011]  You know, Hood County volunteers, whatever you've done, call the volunteers of your county and come together and be prepared.
[02:18:27.031 --> 02:18:29.534]  I was about to say, they have demonized the term malicious so much.
[02:18:29.614 --> 02:18:30.655]  It's in the Second Amendment.
[02:18:30.695 --> 02:18:31.055]  It's great.
[02:18:31.075 --> 02:18:31.616]  It's wonderful.
[02:18:32.076 --> 02:18:32.877]  They try to infiltrate it.
[02:18:33.317 --> 02:18:44.848]  Civil defense, county volunteers, whatever you want to call it, and people now get, when we used to tell them it's horrible food, when the clampdown comes, whether they stage a bombing, a war, a virus, we warned them that their main thing was a virus.
[02:18:45.069 --> 02:18:46.250]  We told you that thousands of times.
[02:18:46.270 --> 02:18:47.271]  It's in my film, Endgame.
[02:18:47.631 --> 02:18:49.972]  That they'll use that as the first clamp down and normalize it.
[02:18:50.012 --> 02:18:51.093]  Then they'll have political violence.
[02:18:51.333 --> 02:18:52.734]  Then they'll try to make it permanent.
[02:18:53.374 --> 02:18:54.895]  We're not joking around here.

[02:19:05.220 --> 02:19:08.421]  So Stuart, I'm glad you raised that because this is total siege we're under.
[02:19:08.861 --> 02:19:15.945]  The globalists literally are training us to be obsolete and now, this last week, I can't believe the clip I played it Friday and Thursday, Klaus Schwab said,
[02:19:16.986 --> 02:19:19.668]  Industries where you come in close contact with humans are over!
[02:19:20.288 --> 02:19:22.789]  I mean, do you imagine like that in a science fiction movie?
[02:19:22.810 --> 02:19:30.054]  Like, some weird German Blofeld Bond villain is like, you will never shake hands or take the mask off!
[02:19:30.414 --> 02:19:33.996]  You will never be in an industry where you're close to people again!
[02:19:34.016 --> 02:19:37.578]  I mean, why don't we just induct ourselves into this?
[02:19:37.598 --> 02:19:41.801]  Throw a rave, throw a block party, have a biker rally, just live like free people.
[02:19:42.101 --> 02:19:44.082]  And when they come try to stop you, defend yourselves.
[02:19:44.622 --> 02:19:45.083]  Pretty simple.
[02:19:45.803 --> 02:19:56.786]  I mean, I agree with you and that's what's great is these big events in Europe, where the lockdown is even stronger, the beta test is millions are coming out and it's getting worse and the people aren't backing down.
[02:19:56.806 --> 02:19:57.706]  You know what it reminds me of?
[02:19:57.926 --> 02:20:10.050]  Right before East Germany finally fell, when communism fell in East Germany, they did peaceful marches around through the town with candlelight vigils and they did that every week and it got bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger until like a hundred thousand people
[02:20:10.550 --> 02:20:14.992]  And again, Ceausescu, what happened in Poland, what happened in Germany, you all know about tyrants falling.
[02:20:32.790 --> 02:20:42.336]  That's because they fall if we make them fall, and the best way to do it is just noncompliance, because in Eastern Germany, the military and the police just said, this sucks, we're not doing this anymore.
[02:20:42.476 --> 02:20:42.716]  Right.
[02:20:42.836 --> 02:20:47.039]  They finally said enough, and it was not enough secret police to go and arrest everybody.
[02:20:47.079 --> 02:20:47.499]  Couldn't do it.
[02:20:47.519 --> 02:20:48.840]  So that's what you have to do.
[02:20:48.860 --> 02:20:49.720]  You have to stand together.
[02:20:49.961 --> 02:20:54.804]  But the founder's lesson is, is hey, and like Solzhenitsyn said too, sometimes you have to fight.
[02:20:55.064 --> 02:20:56.865]  So be ready in case you must fight.
[02:20:57.583 --> 02:21:04.850]  And that's the deal, is I'm strong enough, and I've had enough experience in my life where I've had rites of passage of violence, so I'm not young anymore.
[02:21:04.891 --> 02:21:08.614]  I know I don't want to have to have them, but as an older man, I know if I have to, I will.
[02:21:09.075 --> 02:21:10.296]  And the thing is, they just keep pushing.
[02:21:10.876 --> 02:21:11.577]  And it's like, wow!
[02:21:12.578 --> 02:21:12.818]  Wow.
[02:21:13.238 --> 02:21:19.040]  And I just want the globalists to know, if this goes to a shooting war, it's not cops and the military folks that are the target, it's the globalists.
[02:21:19.080 --> 02:21:20.000]  And I don't want that to happen.
[02:21:20.340 --> 02:21:27.283]  I'm just saying, you know, they're making a list of us and they're on TV saying they're going to come arrest all of us and put us in re-education camps.
[02:21:27.623 --> 02:21:32.144]  And I just want all the people making those statements to know, it doesn't usually end well for Mussolini and people like you.
[02:21:32.264 --> 02:21:32.704]  That's right.
[02:21:33.104 --> 02:21:34.045]  Look at how Mussolini ended.
[02:21:34.105 --> 02:21:34.985]  Look at Ceausescu.
[02:21:35.501 --> 02:21:44.486]  So, you know, and every veteran out there understands in warfare, once the fight starts, it's command and control, it's resources, you know, it's leadership.
[02:21:44.786 --> 02:21:45.727]  So that's just how it goes.
[02:21:46.367 --> 02:21:47.468]  So, yeah.
[02:21:47.628 --> 02:21:48.508]  And I think they know that.
[02:21:48.588 --> 02:21:49.629]  And didn't they see the Capitol?
[02:21:49.669 --> 02:21:51.310]  That was a sputtering deal.
[02:21:51.330 --> 02:21:52.551]  It was only a few people LARPing.
[02:21:52.831 --> 02:21:55.112]  But that ought to show them, how about a real army?
[02:21:55.532 --> 02:21:56.853]  That was not an insurrection.
[02:21:57.333 --> 02:22:00.115]  If the people who were in the Capitol wanted to take the Capitol, they'd have taken it.
[02:22:00.615 --> 02:22:01.515]  That's not what we were there for.
[02:22:01.976 --> 02:22:07.318]  So, you know, that was nothing compared to what it would be like if there was actually a fight in this country.
[02:22:07.759 --> 02:22:08.639]  It wouldn't be like that.
[02:22:08.879 --> 02:22:09.940]  It'd be very different.
[02:22:10.120 --> 02:22:15.102]  Then why is Blofeld, because I don't know if you've seen this, and in fact I'll just end the show with this.
[02:22:15.182 --> 02:22:16.883]  Guys, pull up Greg Reese's last report.
[02:22:17.263 --> 02:22:18.084]  I forget the exact name.
[02:22:18.104 --> 02:22:20.165]  Go to Bandot Video and just pull it up right there.
[02:22:20.205 --> 02:22:21.065]  It's extremely powerful.
[02:22:21.405 --> 02:22:23.526]  And when I saw him make the statement, I went and I said, when is that?
[02:22:23.566 --> 02:22:24.567]  He just made it the day before.
[02:22:25.267 --> 02:22:29.009]  He literally is making statements like, a lot of it's in German, you have to read the transcripts, but a lot of it's in English.
[02:22:29.369 --> 02:22:30.570]  You will now eat bugs!
[02:22:31.551 --> 02:22:32.451]  No, and weeds!
[02:22:32.771 --> 02:22:34.293]  And you'll never see people again!
[02:22:34.313 --> 02:22:35.233]  And you'll be happy.
[02:22:35.253 --> 02:22:39.396]  And then we've got cartoons in England showing kids, like, the computer tells you when you can go.
[02:22:39.836 --> 02:22:41.398]  Once a week, you're allowed to leave your house.
[02:22:41.798 --> 02:22:43.199]  And once a year, you have meat.
[02:22:43.459 --> 02:22:44.059]  I'm not kidding!
[02:22:44.520 --> 02:22:49.904]  They're showing kids cartoons, and it's like the worst frickin' deal, and it doesn't even sound real when I'm saying this!
[02:22:50.204 --> 02:22:55.848]  You're going to eat bugs, and you'll never going to see people!
[02:22:56.874 --> 02:23:01.118]  The best answer is make fun of them and laugh, and then continue to be a free American.
[02:23:01.158 --> 02:23:01.899]  Yeah, there's the video.
[02:23:02.219 --> 02:23:08.425]  He said you're going to eat bugs earlier this year, but in this video, he actually says, there will be no industry where you are in close contact.
[02:23:09.566 --> 02:23:11.387]  I mean, what a fundamental statement of that.
[02:23:12.769 --> 02:23:14.370]  And what he says becomes like law.
[02:23:14.931 --> 02:23:15.371]  No, it doesn't.
[02:23:15.391 --> 02:23:17.093]  It's pretend legislation.
[02:23:17.493 --> 02:23:19.515]  No, I know, but I mean, how fantastical is that?
[02:23:20.839 --> 02:23:23.360]  You will not, you will not be in close contact!
[02:23:23.740 --> 02:23:26.082]  That's, they'll let you know what they're going to do to you if you let them.
[02:23:26.522 --> 02:23:28.103]  But it takes your own cooperation.
[02:23:28.463 --> 02:23:32.525]  They can't create a slave plantation of the entire planet if you refuse to be a slave.
[02:23:32.545 --> 02:23:33.085]  It just won't work.
[02:23:33.265 --> 02:23:33.845]  I totally agree.
[02:23:33.926 --> 02:23:35.066]  Alright, here is the report.
[02:23:35.846 --> 02:23:37.107]  And that's it for this transmission.
[02:23:38.048 --> 02:23:38.648]  Uh, wow.
[02:23:38.748 --> 02:23:40.629]  Please tell everybody to tune in to the retransmission.
[02:23:40.669 --> 02:23:48.693]  Download this full show once it's archived to Mandot Video because... Explain to them, Stuart, how important they are as Paul Revere's in, in, in, in...
[02:23:49.952 --> 02:23:53.653]  Now that most of the web has been censored, how important Banned.video is in this interview.
[02:23:53.693 --> 02:23:55.774]  I mean, when you get excited it gets millions of views.
[02:23:55.994 --> 02:23:57.094]  When you don't it gets 50,000 views.
[02:23:57.995 --> 02:24:00.936]  They're censoring everybody because they can't win if this info comes out.
[02:24:01.116 --> 02:24:01.516]  That's right.
[02:24:01.756 --> 02:24:03.557]  The truth will always set you free.
[02:24:03.977 --> 02:24:08.278]  Make sure that you spread all of the truth, like you said, from whatever source it is.
[02:24:08.558 --> 02:24:14.841]  Make sure it's credible, but it's becoming easier and easier to tip your neighbors off to the truth, and more and more of them are waking up.
[02:24:15.121 --> 02:24:15.801]  So help them.
[02:24:16.141 --> 02:24:18.644]  And be willing to forgive them, as a good Christian should.
[02:24:18.664 --> 02:24:22.007]  I don't care whether they used to be, you know, a radical leftist or whatever they are.
[02:24:22.387 --> 02:24:23.749]  No one is beyond redemption.
[02:24:24.109 --> 02:24:25.771]  So make sure that you leave the door open.
[02:24:25.811 --> 02:24:29.835]  If they're willing to come and see the truth, say, hey man, you know, there's common ground here.
[02:24:30.175 --> 02:24:33.498]  We both can look at what's going on with GameStop right now and see that Wall Street's corrupt.
[02:24:33.799 --> 02:24:36.922]  Now you're starting to see the masks come off of all these politicians, both left and right.
[02:24:37.222 --> 02:24:40.424]  We want to call out the bad Republicans, too, like I call out Abbott.
[02:24:40.644 --> 02:24:44.085]  Make sure you call on both sides, so you have credibility in your community.
[02:24:44.365 --> 02:24:45.766]  And I agree with you.
[02:24:46.346 --> 02:24:46.806]  I agree with you.
[02:24:46.846 --> 02:24:48.507]  The GameStop is a great way to reach out to people.
[02:24:48.767 --> 02:24:53.289]  Whatever the new hot issue is, you tie it back in, because they're saying it's populist, they're saying arrest the GameStop.
[02:24:53.490 --> 02:24:56.631]  Hey, did you hear they want to arrest the GameStop people, like the Capitol people now?
[02:24:57.591 --> 02:24:58.152]  And just do it.
[02:24:58.172 --> 02:25:01.293]  And I want to end the show the way I started it, and we'll play this Gregory's Report.
[02:25:01.673 --> 02:25:02.454]  Eric Swalwell.
[02:25:03.194 --> 02:25:10.076]  Who's on the Intelligence Committee now, ran the impeachment against Trump, an admitted communist Chinese spy with a sex operative.
[02:25:10.516 --> 02:25:13.397]  He says, and it would be a short war, my friend.
[02:25:14.217 --> 02:25:17.939]  The government has the nukes, too many of them, but they're legit.
[02:25:18.319 --> 02:25:21.960]  I'm sure if we talked, we could find common ground to protect our families and communities.
[02:25:22.240 --> 02:25:24.941]  He was somebody saying, Second Amendment, you're not going to get our guns.
[02:25:25.566 --> 02:25:25.826]  Okay?
[02:25:26.127 --> 02:25:27.267]  And he says, no, we'll nuke you.
[02:25:27.868 --> 02:25:33.152]  Again, never in the military, never studied nuclear weapons, he doesn't know that that's a thing to destroy whole cities or whole armies.
[02:25:33.753 --> 02:25:37.556]  He'd kill just as many leftists if he bombed a city, probably more.
[02:25:37.736 --> 02:25:39.097]  The cities are blue, dumbass.
[02:25:39.277 --> 02:25:41.979]  But to him, it's like, we'll just nuke you.
[02:25:41.999 --> 02:25:49.465]  You're a homicidal maniac, worse than Adolf Hitler here, but it just shows how they want to use the military, but they have no idea about what they're talking about.
[02:25:49.625 --> 02:25:52.588]  And he's presuming the guys that control those nukes would ever follow his orders.
[02:25:53.271 --> 02:25:55.713]  They probably wouldn't, because they don't want to nuke their own country.
[02:25:56.153 --> 02:26:02.638]  If I was sitting there in a silo, or I was in a base, and my officer told me to nuke my own city, you know, I wouldn't just not follow the order.
[02:26:03.119 --> 02:26:03.939]  I mean, you know what would happen.
[02:26:04.360 --> 02:26:06.762]  Yeah, you draw your .45 and do what you have to do.
[02:26:06.782 --> 02:26:13.467]  Yeah, and we wouldn't want to, but I mean, if a general walked in, or you got and said, fire a nuclear weapon at Dallas, Texas, what would happen?
[02:26:13.687 --> 02:26:14.988]  Well, it's an unlawful order.
[02:26:15.108 --> 02:26:17.670]  So you first refuse, but you could also relieve him of his command.
[02:26:18.371 --> 02:26:19.071]  So that's what you do.
[02:26:20.172 --> 02:26:21.013]  And then what if he resists?
[02:26:21.724 --> 02:26:23.806]  Like I said, you put him in cuffs, you relieve him of his command.
[02:26:40.089 --> 02:26:53.682]  At the age of 33, Klaus Schwab, a business professor at the University of Geneva, founded the World Economic Forum in 1971, originally known as the European Management Forum.
[02:26:55.373 --> 02:27:12.267]  Nicknamed Davos after its annual meeting place, the World Economic Forum meets every January with hundreds of members of business, politics, banking, education and industry to quote, improve the state of the world.
[02:27:13.448 --> 02:27:17.492]  Their globalist agenda is openly admitted and well documented.
[02:27:18.678 --> 02:27:31.130]  United Nations Agenda 2030, The Great Reset, Build Back Better, are all the same globalist agenda, and all stem from the Club of Rome and the eugenics movement.
[02:27:32.391 --> 02:27:42.461]  Davos claims to be looking to save the planet, and the UN claim that in 10 years they will end all hunger and poverty on Earth.
[02:27:43.646 --> 02:27:48.548]  They admit that the technologies required to achieve these goals do not exist.
[02:27:49.349 --> 02:27:54.631]  And yet, their solution is to bring the world to zero emissions in only 10 years.
[02:27:55.592 --> 02:28:00.634]  They want to end the automobile and aviation industries in only 10 years.
[02:28:01.574 --> 02:28:07.237]  This is why the Keystone Pipeline was halted on day one by globalist puppet Joe Biden.
[02:28:09.841 --> 02:28:15.384]  Klaus Schwab says that industries which involve human interaction will not survive.
[02:28:15.744 --> 02:28:24.228]  But we know that many industries which rely particularly on physical interaction will have difficulties to survive.
[02:28:24.668 --> 02:28:39.175]  As if the destruction of an entire functioning society will inspire solutions to all of our problems, thereby bringing about an environmental utopia where there is no hunger and all the world is at peace.
[02:28:40.501 --> 02:28:44.926]  As absurd as this all sounds, we know the sheep will accept it as gospel.
[02:28:45.747 --> 02:28:46.748]  They already have.
[02:28:47.949 --> 02:28:54.837]  When the WHO was caught faking a hoax 10 years ago, the media reported it, but nobody cared.
[02:28:55.718 --> 02:28:56.759]  It was a beta test.
[02:28:57.580 --> 02:29:01.304]  Now, the media ignores overwhelming evidence that COVID-19 is a hoax.
[02:29:03.390 --> 02:29:10.255]  They go along with every contradiction and lie, and their audience obediently accepts it all as truth.
[02:29:11.316 --> 02:29:17.941]  The COVID crisis will be used to imprison the population, whether it be in camps or their own home.
[02:29:18.742 --> 02:29:19.943]  It is already happening.
[02:29:20.523 --> 02:29:25.928]  Humanity is being imprisoned by psychopaths who see themselves as our saviors.
[02:29:27.617 --> 02:29:29.018]  Order out of chaos.
[02:29:29.678 --> 02:29:36.141]  The New World Order is nothing other than the decrepit Old World Order desperately clinging to power.
[02:29:36.782 --> 02:29:44.406]  And their solution is to destroy the free market, to destroy the concept of freedom, privacy, and private property.
[02:29:45.427 --> 02:29:57.665]  And to foment enough chaos and destruction to depopulate the Earth into a manageable level of serfs and slaves, so they can continue on with the same old scams they've been running for millennia.
[02:29:59.215 --> 02:30:06.800]  This is why Joe Biden signed a dozen executive orders, paving the way to opening the borders and shutting down the economy.
[02:30:07.881 --> 02:30:11.804]  The New World Order cannot coexist with American civil liberties.
[02:30:12.604 --> 02:30:18.709]  And now that the populist movement has been discarded, the destruction of America from within can commence again.
[02:30:20.670 --> 02:30:27.054]  If the people of the world continue to comply to these unelected sycophants, then the people will get what they deserve.
[02:30:28.072 --> 02:30:30.369]  For InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
