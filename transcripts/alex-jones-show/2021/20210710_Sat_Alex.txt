[00:00:15.456 --> 00:00:19.641]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:20.181 --> 00:00:26.188]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're about to break exclusive information on this Saturday afternoon.
[00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:34.297]  We have just shot more than three hours of interviews in a special emergency report, but
[00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:48.109]  During the shooting I was contacted by a major investigative journalist who's broken hundreds of major stories and he's going to be exclusively breaking tomorrow on my Sunday show 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.530]  the following information.
[00:00:49.671 --> 00:00:56.016]  He has the government documents plus it's all backed up in UN statements and other health minister statements around the world.
[00:00:56.916 --> 00:01:02.541]  The UN is in control of the global health response and is directing Biden
[00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:22.587]  with these strike force teams to go into houses forcibly, particularly public housing where they can violate people's rights easier, and screen everyone forcibly with PCR tests with contact tracer strike teams, and if they don't agree to it, they're going to try to evict them, throw them out, or arrest them.
[00:01:22.967 --> 00:01:27.850]  This has already been happening in Australia, it's been happening in Canada, it's been happening all over the world, and it's all UN directed.
[00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:28.619]  It's
[00:01:49.127 --> 00:01:51.948]  Calling for a medical passport to be able to buy and sell.
[00:01:52.008 --> 00:01:56.429]  And Klaus Schwab, the head, says they want implantable microchips and forced inoculations.
[00:01:56.489 --> 00:01:58.810]  In fact, Biden's now talking about forced inoculations.
[00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.071]  The UK is, the EU is, France.
[00:02:01.611 --> 00:02:02.211]  It's all here.
[00:02:02.671 --> 00:02:05.692]  And they admit these injections don't protect you from COVID.
[00:02:06.652 --> 00:02:08.273]  It's the perfect takeover plan.
[00:02:08.333 --> 00:02:09.613]  It's all in operation lockstep.
[00:02:09.633 --> 00:02:14.115]  So tomorrow, 4 p.m., we're gonna be breaking this information
[00:02:15.277 --> 00:02:24.703]  4 PM Central with the documents and I'm going to collate and get together all the other admissions and documents that are public from the UN and how this is being rolled out and what you can expect.
[00:02:24.743 --> 00:02:34.849]  The good news is Senator Ted Cruz and others are backlashing and saying we're passing bills or introducing bills where you can't do contact tracers, you can't grab people out of their houses.
[00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:37.389]  Some states in the U.S.
[00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:39.250]  still have eugenics laws on the books.
[00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.210]  Decker Carlson talked about it last week, where they can take you and sterilize you with no judge or jury.
[00:02:43.911 --> 00:02:47.011]  So, eugenics laws are still there from 100 years ago, 120 years ago.
[00:02:47.351 --> 00:02:48.531]  Margaret Sanger got them on the books.
[00:02:49.272 --> 00:02:52.192]  I had Michael Malice on the Friday Show talking about that.
[00:02:52.232 --> 00:02:53.772]  He came back on today to talk more about it.
[00:02:54.013 --> 00:02:54.613]  That's coming up.
[00:02:55.073 --> 00:02:55.973]  But this is it.
[00:02:56.033 --> 00:02:57.153]  On a scale of 1 to 10, this is a 10.
[00:02:58.693 --> 00:02:59.694]  It's so out of control.
[00:02:59.814 --> 00:03:00.534]  It's so evil.
[00:03:01.954 --> 00:03:10.936]  You're about to see the special three-plus-hour transmission with Michael Malice, Nick Fuentes, Andrew Torba, and so much more.
[00:03:11.416 --> 00:03:13.756]  But please understand, this is making it a break of time.
[00:03:14.036 --> 00:03:15.176]  This is when they're making their move.
[00:03:15.796 --> 00:03:21.977]  Oh, and finally, tomorrow I'll also cover what I predicted on Thursday when the, quote, gay choir in San Francisco broke.
[00:03:22.437 --> 00:03:30.039]  And it's a hundred dudes or so saying, we're coming for your children, we're going to corrupt them, we're going to groom them, we're going to take them over.
[00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:30.939]  Remember all that?
[00:03:31.894 --> 00:03:36.297]  I said they need to run a background check on all these people and find out how many of them are convicted child molesters.
[00:03:37.158 --> 00:03:41.981]  And it turns out a whole bunch of the names match specifically to that and aliases.
[00:03:42.081 --> 00:03:43.783]  So it needs to be investigated, it needs to be looked at.
[00:03:43.803 --> 00:03:50.387]  We've got a big article on InfoWars.com showing that from the Western Journalism Center and a lot of others are working on this as well.
[00:03:50.407 --> 00:04:00.935]  But this is really global tyranny wrapped in the rainbow flag, pedophilia wrapped in the rainbow flag, the destruction of our youth wrapped in the rainbow flag, the destruction of our health wrapped in this rainbow flag.
[00:04:01.963 --> 00:04:07.346]  An unapproved genetic engineering therapy being forced on us to just set the precedent for anything to go.
[00:04:07.386 --> 00:04:13.789]  Remember a month ago, the Senate would not pass a bill banning human animal cloning, splicing humans and animals, because it's already been going on.
[00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:15.670]  They wouldn't even pass it.
[00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:17.451]  That's how much trouble we're in.
[00:04:17.911 --> 00:04:21.653]  Evil's making its move on every front, with the censorship and the control and everything.
[00:04:21.853 --> 00:04:29.357]  But thanks to you, Paul Reveres, black, white, old, young, I love you all, we're in this together, the signal is still getting out.
[00:04:29.397 --> 00:04:30.518]  So take this special feed.
[00:04:31.414 --> 00:04:34.357]  Take this intro clip here and share it on Twitter, Facebook, everywhere.
[00:04:34.597 --> 00:04:35.778]  Share it on your email, your text message.
[00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:37.720]  Have your friends over and show them this!
[00:04:38.761 --> 00:04:41.284]  And have them tune in tomorrow at 4 p.m.
[00:04:41.364 --> 00:04:41.724]  Central.
[00:04:41.744 --> 00:04:47.850]  And then whatever you do, please realize we're only on air because of your word of mouth, your prayers, and your support.
[00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.873]  We've got big sales that end this Sunday, tomorrow.
[00:04:51.193 --> 00:04:55.758]  Free shipping, double patriot points storewide, 10% off water filters, 10% off storable food.
[00:04:57.133 --> 00:05:00.536]  A bunch of other big discounts on the supplements and products.
[00:05:00.996 --> 00:05:02.718]  Those sales are going to end on Sunday.
[00:05:03.078 --> 00:05:06.581]  We'll still have X2 for 40% off and 60% off the spray bottle.
[00:05:06.661 --> 00:05:07.221]  It's amazing.
[00:05:08.122 --> 00:05:09.303]  That will be our new sale.
[00:05:09.323 --> 00:05:13.246]  That's going to be everything else ends this Sunday, so please check out InfoWarshaw.com.
[00:05:13.447 --> 00:05:14.948]  I want to thank you all who've been supporters.
[00:05:15.248 --> 00:05:16.089]  You're the reason we're here.
[00:05:16.109 --> 00:05:17.651]  You're the reason we're saving all these lives.
[00:05:17.911 --> 00:05:22.656]  You're the reason the whole world's quote becoming Alex Jones and quote Tucker Carlson's Alex Jones and Joe Rogan's Alex Jones.
[00:05:22.876 --> 00:05:23.777]  No, no, they're not Alex Jones.
[00:05:24.117 --> 00:05:28.041]  They heard my warnings, they looked at the proof, and now they're awake just as awake as I am.
[00:05:28.061 --> 00:05:30.644]  Because Tucker Carlson's looking at real eugenics documents.
[00:05:31.425 --> 00:05:33.086]  He's looking at the same thing I looked at all those years ago.
[00:05:33.186 --> 00:05:34.608]  And now he's waking up completely.
[00:05:34.908 --> 00:05:35.809]  And it's a chain reaction.
[00:05:35.829 --> 00:05:36.550]  We're doing it together.
[00:05:37.045 --> 00:05:38.285]  So thank you, and thank God.
[00:05:38.645 --> 00:05:39.766]  Here is the main transmission.
[00:05:39.786 --> 00:05:43.706]  I really appreciate the crew coming out on Saturday to get this together, and I appreciate all these guests as well.
[00:05:44.087 --> 00:05:47.387]  The Nick Fuentes was taped a few days ago, and he was still here in Austin.
[00:05:48.027 --> 00:05:51.088]  He's since been banned on Twitter, so that's a powerful interview as well.
[00:05:51.388 --> 00:05:53.029]  So please, stay with us.
[00:05:53.549 --> 00:05:54.429]  Here's the transmission.
[00:05:54.829 --> 00:05:55.489]  What are we going to do again?
[00:05:55.509 --> 00:06:00.550]  You're going to take this feed, and you're going to take the archive of this banned-out video, and you're going to share it.
[00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.991]  This is the mission.
[00:06:02.191 --> 00:06:03.011]  I know you're going to accept it.
[00:06:03.071 --> 00:06:03.631]  Thank you so much.
[00:06:13.019 --> 00:06:26.927]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:29.489 --> 00:06:35.552]  And you have put us on the front lines on this Saturday, July 10th, worldwide transmission.
[00:06:36.513 --> 00:06:37.894]  I hope all of you watching
[00:06:39.332 --> 00:06:44.738]  We'll take the live feed and the archive that's posted at Band.Video and share it to the Four Winds.
[00:06:45.119 --> 00:06:49.383]  And I want to commend this amazing crew for the hard work they're doing seven days a week.
[00:06:49.404 --> 00:06:50.525]  We're trying to hire more people.
[00:06:50.885 --> 00:06:51.866]  We're trying to expand.
[00:06:52.747 --> 00:06:54.790]  But it's just you that keeps us on air, listeners.
[00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:55.631]  We love you.
[00:06:55.951 --> 00:06:56.572]  Okay, coming up!
[00:06:58.115 --> 00:07:01.036]  I taped an interview yesterday with Nick Fuentes before he left to Houston.
[00:07:01.416 --> 00:07:04.417]  He just got banned off Twitter, so we're going to air that first.
[00:07:05.578 --> 00:07:12.280]  Then we've got here in town, he's moving here, we have Michael Malice, amazing, really smart guy, one of the smartest guys I know.
[00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:13.500]  He's going to be here.
[00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:19.282]  And then Andrew Torba, the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center called out, called for his banning and Nick Fuentes'.
[00:07:19.742 --> 00:07:21.643]  They want his physical site taken offline.
[00:07:21.743 --> 00:07:22.744]  Oh, go build your own thing.
[00:07:23.304 --> 00:07:23.704]  Not anymore.
[00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:26.344]  Nick Fuentes just got banned on Twitter.
[00:07:26.926 --> 00:07:28.511]  Andrew Torba is going to respond to that.
[00:07:28.552 --> 00:07:29.575]  And we've got Thomas!
[00:07:30.834 --> 00:07:31.694]  In Florida.
[00:07:31.714 --> 00:07:32.355]  Who's a caller?
[00:07:32.835 --> 00:07:35.136]  But more and more I want to elevate callers because they're so smart.
[00:07:35.656 --> 00:07:40.538]  He brought up a lot of documents I knew were true dealing with the endgame of the globalists.
[00:07:41.119 --> 00:07:42.799]  So you want next decade's news today?
[00:07:42.839 --> 00:07:48.542]  You're going to get it today because we had him on for two segments on Thursday.
[00:07:48.582 --> 00:07:53.324]  It was not enough time and so he'll be joining us at the end of this transmission.
[00:07:53.344 --> 00:07:56.626]  But first, here is the thought criminal
[00:07:57.486 --> 00:08:00.790]  I mean, if Nick Fuentes was David Duke, I'd say he gets his free speech.
[00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:02.071]  I don't like David Duke.
[00:08:02.111 --> 00:08:02.792]  He doesn't like me.
[00:08:03.412 --> 00:08:05.955]  Nick Fuentes is just an America First guy.
[00:08:07.256 --> 00:08:08.998]  But if I disagree with him, he has his rights.
[00:08:09.038 --> 00:08:14.784]  But he got banned off of Twitter because the Southern Poverty Law Center and the ADL asked, why the hell is he online?
[00:08:15.125 --> 00:08:19.489]  So we went to breakfast yesterday morning before we left to Houston.
[00:08:20.547 --> 00:08:36.141]  And here is that interview with Nick Fuentes, and then we will come back with Michael Malice, Andrew Torba, and Thomas from Florida on this special Saturday global transmission, which is going to reach a million people.
[00:08:36.401 --> 00:08:42.466]  But if you decide to share it and tell everybody you know to share it, you'll get 10 million views, and that'll really piss the globalists off.
[00:08:42.787 --> 00:08:45.929]  So here's Nick Fuentes and I having breakfast yesterday.
[00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:53.845]  As we speak, in a little town in Idaho, all the big tech giants are meeting with current and former U.S.
[00:08:53.885 --> 00:08:57.027]  intelligence operatives, figuring out how to create a monopoly.
[00:08:57.827 --> 00:09:01.270]  In their own words, they admit they're creating a post-human world.
[00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:09.395]  They're telling us that we're obsolete, that we're non-essential, and only their big tech companies, only their big box stores are allowed to operate.
[00:09:09.455 --> 00:09:16.240]  And all these companies have pushed virtual meetings and working from home, because then they can surveil everything you're saying and doing
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.902]  Over these apps and that's all come out.
[00:09:19.223 --> 00:09:36.543]  So this is the next level of the surveillance state Raping us digitally forcing itself on us and then the real world the third dimension they can put you on no-fly list They can take your banking away They even have anti for them beat you up if you dare go out and you know protest your Second Amendment or family values anything
[00:09:37.711 --> 00:09:47.520]  So we're gonna be talking to a real victim of this, and this individual's been put on a no-fly list two and a half months ago, and they won't take him off the no-fly list.
[00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:48.521]  He has no criminal record.
[00:09:49.362 --> 00:09:50.163]  He's Nick Fuentes.
[00:09:50.203 --> 00:09:57.790]  We're meeting him here at this little diner because this is a microcosm of people want little diners, people want small stores, people want mom and pop.
[00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:02.954]  The quality's always better, the ratings are always better, but the system declared places like this
[00:10:03.908 --> 00:10:04.488]  Not essential.
[00:10:04.528 --> 00:10:07.709]  It was closed for six months and almost went out of business.
[00:10:07.849 --> 00:10:12.810]  It's Shroyer & Co., a little Louisiana-style diner that you find in the 1950s.
[00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:17.311]  And it used to be totally packed, but since the pandemic happened, I come here all the time.
[00:10:17.591 --> 00:10:20.992]  You can come in basically and there's hardly ever even anybody here.
[00:10:21.412 --> 00:10:22.553]  And so I hope they don't go out of business.
[00:10:22.573 --> 00:10:23.253]  This is over on
[00:10:24.253 --> 00:10:25.634]  Well, well, well.
[00:10:25.654 --> 00:10:27.056]  If it isn't my fellow thought criminal, Nick Fuentes.
[00:10:27.076 --> 00:10:27.456]  Good morning.
[00:10:27.476 --> 00:10:28.637]  Good to see you.
[00:10:28.677 --> 00:10:29.418]  Good to see you, brother.
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:54.403]  I wanted to meet you here while you were in town because this is just a classic old-fashioned diner, barely in business.
[00:10:54.463 --> 00:10:57.646]  Used to be lines Monday through Friday, weekends, you name it.
[00:10:58.046 --> 00:11:00.447]  Now I can come here on a Saturday and there's hardly anybody here.
[00:11:01.288 --> 00:11:02.949]  Just an example of the economic warfare.
[00:11:03.029 --> 00:11:07.512]  How is this non-essential, but how is a big box store essential?
[00:11:07.552 --> 00:11:14.337]  I mean, this is the real discrimination, Nick, and you have been a trooper about it, but my God, you had to drive to Texas, you told me over the phone?
[00:11:14.557 --> 00:11:15.157]  That's right, yeah.
[00:11:15.197 --> 00:11:16.238]  It took a road trip.
[00:11:16.258 --> 00:11:21.901]  It took me, I think, 30 hours to get from Chicago to the West Coast and then back through Texas.
[00:11:22.381 --> 00:11:23.222]  That's exactly right.
[00:11:23.262 --> 00:11:31.607]  This is the kind of economic warfare and political warfare, too, going on, not just against dissidents like you and I, but even against regular people, small business owners.
[00:11:32.487 --> 00:11:36.389]  We're all in this together, liberal, conservative, gay, straight, black, white, old, young.
[00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:40.192]  Let's see if this little side door is open, because I come here all the time.
[00:11:40.212 --> 00:11:41.552]  I guess I'm letting the secret out.
[00:11:41.993 --> 00:11:43.974]  But I do want to see this place, you know, stay in business.
[00:11:45.316 --> 00:11:46.237]  Here's a little side door.
[00:11:46.257 --> 00:11:48.078]  I mean, they'd rather you go in the front, so let's go in the front.
[00:11:48.618 --> 00:11:50.739]  But they got a great Airstream trailer out here.
[00:11:50.959 --> 00:11:54.881]  And there's all sorts of little places like this that are no longer open in Austin anymore.
[00:11:55.662 --> 00:11:58.343]  So it's really, really, really sad.
[00:11:59.364 --> 00:12:02.545]  But this place has, this place has a great patio.
[00:12:02.645 --> 00:12:06.267]  It's got a great bar out here.
[00:12:06.287 --> 00:12:09.109]  You have to get an old-fashioned diner.
[00:12:13.979 --> 00:12:15.060]  Some of my crew is already here.
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:15.800]  They're meeting us here.
[00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:19.442]  I took the liberty to order some food over the phone.
[00:12:21.003 --> 00:12:22.664]  Hi, how are you doing?
[00:12:23.064 --> 00:12:24.125]  Good to see you.
[00:12:24.745 --> 00:12:25.986]  Thanks for everything.
[00:12:26.026 --> 00:12:26.726]  Have a seat, my friend.
[00:12:26.786 --> 00:12:27.487]  Alright, thank you.
[00:12:27.847 --> 00:12:29.167]  Some of my crew is already here.
[00:12:29.868 --> 00:12:30.568]  I'm a little bit late.
[00:12:31.429 --> 00:12:32.569]  They've already ordered some food.
[00:12:32.689 --> 00:12:34.530]  A little piece of America right here, my friend.
[00:12:34.591 --> 00:12:35.451]  Yeah, it looks great.
[00:12:35.511 --> 00:12:37.092]  It's a pretty classic place here.
[00:12:37.172 --> 00:12:38.393]  And a little piece of America right here.
[00:12:39.844 --> 00:12:40.945]  What's front and center for you?
[00:12:41.025 --> 00:12:44.188]  I know that you were going to go to Arizona, but Cancel Culture attacked that as well.
[00:12:44.829 --> 00:12:45.289]  That's right.
[00:12:45.309 --> 00:12:54.277]  I was supposed to be in Phoenix for a fundraiser with Representative Paul Gosar, actually, who's a friend of ours, and I think one of the best congressmen in America, by the way.
[00:12:54.297 --> 00:13:01.103]  He's been totaling on top of the Ashley Babbitt shooting and the Capitol riot and the persecution of patriots after that.
[00:13:01.123 --> 00:13:06.168]  So we were supposed to have a fundraiser in Phoenix with him, and this is normal political activism, you know?
[00:13:06.983 --> 00:13:08.571]  We're supposed to live in a democracy.
[00:13:08.611 --> 00:13:10.580]  We're supposed to live in a free society.
[00:13:11.038 --> 00:13:13.159]  We're engaging with the democratic institutions.
[00:13:13.199 --> 00:13:16.501]  We're engaging with an elected representative and doing a fundraiser.
[00:13:16.962 --> 00:13:39.996]  And so when word got out that I was doing a fundraiser with Representative Gosar, Jake Tapper, ADL, SPLC, all the usual suspects came out and called it anti-semitic, white nationalist, racist, that kind of thing, and forced us into basically changing our plans with the fundraiser, postponing it until a later time, and we're going to have to change basically the entire way that we're going to do it.
[00:13:40.676 --> 00:13:44.838]  You know, it's kind of amazing because I don't know exactly what they expect patriots to do.
[00:13:45.099 --> 00:13:46.159]  We're part of this country.
[00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:48.521]  75 million people voted for Donald Trump.
[00:13:49.041 --> 00:13:51.002]  And they tell us, well, you can't talk online.
[00:13:51.362 --> 00:13:55.965]  You can't get elected to Congress or to any other political office.
[00:13:55.985 --> 00:13:58.746]  You can't fundraise for people that are already in political office.
[00:13:59.387 --> 00:14:02.628]  What exactly are we supposed to do to make the country the way that we want it to be?
[00:14:02.668 --> 00:14:03.749]  And let's expand on that.
[00:14:03.829 --> 00:14:05.170]  You're an America First guy.
[00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:06.370]  You're not even anti-Israel.
[00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:07.151]  I'm not anti-Israel.
[00:14:07.711 --> 00:14:08.532]  But the fact that
[00:14:09.392 --> 00:14:12.153]  We have Biden literally bowing to the Israeli Prime Minister now.
[00:14:12.173 --> 00:14:12.793]  I thought that was fake.
[00:14:12.813 --> 00:14:13.513]  Turns out it's true.
[00:14:13.533 --> 00:14:19.034]  I thought it was like a fake story where they said that they took Martin Luther King's bust out of the White House when Trump got in.
[00:14:19.074 --> 00:14:19.635]  That wasn't true.
[00:14:20.535 --> 00:14:21.195]  This was true.
[00:14:21.595 --> 00:14:24.456]  So it becomes a little bizarre when that's something you can't criticize.
[00:14:24.476 --> 00:14:28.117]  I believe, I believe in free speech, but I know what you've said.
[00:14:28.137 --> 00:14:28.897]  I know what you've done.
[00:14:29.798 --> 00:14:31.299]  It's not white nationalist.
[00:14:31.339 --> 00:14:32.059]  It's not racist.
[00:14:32.579 --> 00:14:34.760]  But they even try to say Tucker Carlson's a white supremacist.
[00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:36.261]  They even try to say I'm a white supremacist.
[00:14:36.641 --> 00:14:40.883]  When I'm actually a classical liberal and love everybody, it's really, really dangerous.
[00:14:40.923 --> 00:14:45.845]  But now, they're not just calling it the SPLC for the shutdown of Gab.
[00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:50.181]  Which is just lets everybody on just like the internet was just five years ago, three years ago.
[00:14:50.801 --> 00:14:58.303]  They now want to shut down Twitter and the SPLC is writing letters to Congress putting out big reports saying that somehow Twitter is this white supremacist thing.
[00:14:58.323 --> 00:15:04.045]  So really they want a total monopoly of where the public can gather and what we can say and that's the real
[00:15:05.342 --> 00:15:06.163]  Clear and present danger.
[00:15:06.223 --> 00:15:08.386]  That's the closest thing to Nazis I've seen in this country.
[00:15:08.667 --> 00:15:09.688]  Yeah, that's exactly it.
[00:15:09.748 --> 00:15:15.395]  And it started out, I think, years ago when they would say, well, hate speech is when you hate these protected groups.
[00:15:15.456 --> 00:15:17.618]  These, you know, people based on their immutable traits.
[00:15:18.059 --> 00:15:19.581]  And I think there was some consensus that
[00:15:20.282 --> 00:15:21.603]  You know, that that's wrong or something.
[00:15:21.643 --> 00:15:22.603]  But you're exactly right.
[00:15:22.643 --> 00:15:27.105]  Now it's expanded that Donald Trump is a white supremacist who's dangerous and should be banned on Twitter.
[00:15:27.405 --> 00:15:28.865]  And people like yourself, and people like me.
[00:15:29.225 --> 00:15:33.207]  And it's even, at this point, people that are not even white that they're calling white supremacists.
[00:15:33.547 --> 00:15:34.988]  You know, I'll give you a perfect example.
[00:15:35.408 --> 00:15:38.929]  I hosted the America First Political Action Conference earlier this year.
[00:15:38.949 --> 00:15:41.350]  It had Michelle Malkin speaking there.
[00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:43.531]  Michelle Malkin is, I believe, Filipina.
[00:15:43.571 --> 00:15:44.211]  She's Asian.
[00:15:44.251 --> 00:15:46.712]  It had John Miller speaking there from Blaze TV.
[00:15:46.732 --> 00:15:47.412]  He's black.
[00:15:47.452 --> 00:15:48.473]  He's African American.
[00:15:49.173 --> 00:15:52.635]  And so we have this conference where everybody is represented.
[00:15:52.655 --> 00:15:55.396]  There's all different kinds of groups speaking that are attending.
[00:15:55.776 --> 00:15:57.337]  And the message of the conference was this.
[00:15:57.917 --> 00:16:01.799]  I said about the conference that America is going to be a multiracial country.
[00:16:01.859 --> 00:16:03.539]  That's just something that's happening.
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:06.301]  We're going to have to figure out how to get along together.
[00:16:06.321 --> 00:16:11.263]  But if that's going to work, people have got to treat everybody equally with rights, respect, and dignity.
[00:16:11.983 --> 00:16:12.564]  And all of that.
[00:16:13.144 --> 00:16:19.891]  They cut out a few sections of my speech and try to portray me, then, as some kind of a bigot, white supremacist, white nationalist.
[00:16:20.412 --> 00:16:21.272]  It's just dishonest.
[00:16:21.633 --> 00:16:22.634]  And we know what that's about.
[00:16:23.014 --> 00:16:24.616]  It's about shutting down patriots.
[00:16:24.656 --> 00:16:28.099]  It's about shutting down anybody that's an opponent of the American regime.
[00:16:28.159 --> 00:16:30.582]  Anybody that's an opponent... Well, they say Candace Alling is a white supremacist.
[00:16:30.962 --> 00:16:31.582]  That's right, yeah.
[00:16:31.923 --> 00:16:35.804]  Candace Owens and Michelle Malkin and all kinds of other people.
[00:16:36.285 --> 00:16:37.105]  It makes no sense.
[00:16:37.125 --> 00:16:38.406]  We know what it's really about.
[00:16:38.466 --> 00:16:40.947]  It's about shutting down American nationalism.
[00:16:41.047 --> 00:16:42.608]  That's what they oppose at the end of the day.
[00:16:43.308 --> 00:16:45.249]  Talk about what it's like to be on a no-fly list.
[00:16:46.195 --> 00:16:50.758]  Well, you know, at first, I wasn't even sure if I was on the no-fly list.
[00:16:50.898 --> 00:17:02.546]  I actually, to go to my AFPAC conference in Florida earlier this year, I drove just out of an abundance of caution because I had heard from people that you can't check if you're on the no-fly list.
[00:17:02.566 --> 00:17:03.186]  There's no way.
[00:17:03.326 --> 00:17:12.032]  I mean, a lot of people think that you go to a certain website and you type your name in and you do some kind of a search engine and it tells you you're on the no-fly list.
[00:17:12.473 --> 00:17:13.333]  It doesn't work like that.
[00:17:13.813 --> 00:17:15.855]  The way that it works is you show up to the airport.
[00:17:16.636 --> 00:17:17.497]  Ready to travel.
[00:17:17.557 --> 00:17:18.438]  You've booked a flight.
[00:17:18.478 --> 00:17:22.682]  You've paid your money and all of that and they will tell you at the gate you can't fly.
[00:17:23.143 --> 00:17:24.024]  They don't tell you why.
[00:17:24.044 --> 00:17:25.526]  They don't tell you you're on a list.
[00:17:25.586 --> 00:17:30.331]  They don't tell you any other information other than you're just not going to be able to fly.
[00:17:30.511 --> 00:17:33.375]  So I had suspected I was on the no-fly list.
[00:17:33.495 --> 00:17:34.616]  It wasn't until April
[00:17:34.656 --> 00:17:54.152]  April when I tried to go to Florida for a press conference that I showed up to the airport thinking I could fly and found out that I wasn't going to be able to and since then it's been a you know to say the least a massive inconvenience you know I've had to miss weddings I've had to miss baby showers I've had to miss all kinds of different things and the big issue here
[00:17:54.292 --> 00:17:56.573]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:18:31.838 --> 00:18:37.541]  And we are back with a real political dissident, the evil, the infamous Nick Fuentes.
[00:18:37.621 --> 00:18:46.406]  All right, we just ate our little breakfast here in Southeast Austin, in one of these evil, non-essential, small-on-the-pop places.
[00:18:46.506 --> 00:18:49.368]  So back to this incredible dehumanization.
[00:18:49.388 --> 00:19:00.614]  If this can happen to Nick Fuentes, being banned from flying, and not just the inconvenience, the unlawfulness of this, the fact that it's draconian, the fact you don't know how you get on it, how you get off of it, I mean, that's the definition
[00:19:01.274 --> 00:19:06.357]  Yeah, and this is what they're doing in China, this is what they did in the Soviet Union, that's exactly right.
[00:19:26.427 --> 00:19:31.770]  That's the nature of it, too, is this is political terrorism, is what it is, the terrorism that comes from the state.
[00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:47.578]  Because they restrict your liberties, they restrict your rights, and in particular, in my case, freedom of movement, freedom of travel across the country, and they won't tell you that they're doing it, they won't tell you why they're doing it, they won't tell you the nature of it, and maybe the worst thing is that you can't fight it.
[00:19:47.978 --> 00:19:52.761]  And I think that's something really important for people to understand is that you can't fight the federal government.
[00:19:52.801 --> 00:20:04.849]  The federal government which we've created over the past 20 years in particular, since 9-11 and since the War on Terror, the national security apparatus, the intelligence agencies, the Patriot Act, this stuff is unbeatable.
[00:20:05.269 --> 00:20:10.872]  Once the FBI, DHS, the various agencies set their sights on you, you're finished.
[00:20:10.933 --> 00:20:11.553]  You're crushed.
[00:20:11.613 --> 00:20:12.854]  You're sort of at their mercy.
[00:20:12.914 --> 00:20:15.876]  And so ever since I got put on the no-fly list, people have said, well,
[00:20:16.596 --> 00:20:21.160]  He must be able to file a lawsuit or do an application and we're looking into that.
[00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:26.964]  We're going to file a lawsuit against the federal government, but this is something that hasn't even been adjudicated for 60 years.
[00:20:27.004 --> 00:20:31.528]  They just don't do cases on this and you have very limited options for recourse.
[00:20:31.908 --> 00:20:34.130]  So people have to understand before it gets too late.
[00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:42.937]  Then we have to shut this down now because if we get to the point where the federal government can do this to anybody and everybody and once that becomes commonplace, there's no resisting it.
[00:20:42.957 --> 00:20:44.278]  There's no fighting back against it.
[00:20:44.338 --> 00:20:46.060]  So I'm the canary in the coal mine.
[00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:46.981]  It happened to me first.
[00:20:47.361 --> 00:20:48.222]  We have to fight it now.
[00:20:48.242 --> 00:20:49.543]  Well, that's right.
[00:20:49.663 --> 00:20:51.885]  And again, we've had
[00:20:53.406 --> 00:20:54.967]  Six, seven big banks taken from us.
[00:20:55.087 --> 00:20:56.887]  One I had since I was in high school.
[00:20:57.328 --> 00:20:58.528]  Perfect corporate credit.
[00:20:59.448 --> 00:21:00.049]  I mean, perfect.
[00:21:00.089 --> 00:21:00.769]  As good as it gets.
[00:21:01.289 --> 00:21:04.290]  We were paying like 1.7% on credit card transactions.
[00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:05.071]  Nobody gets that.
[00:21:05.271 --> 00:21:06.551]  Because we just didn't do chargebacks.
[00:21:06.571 --> 00:21:07.191]  We would just eat them.
[00:21:07.792 --> 00:21:08.392]  Perfect credit.
[00:21:09.112 --> 00:21:09.612]  Corporate credit.
[00:21:09.692 --> 00:21:13.694]  And they just said, you've been put on a hate listing by a thing called G2.
[00:21:13.754 --> 00:21:17.496]  That's basically part of Interpol and the CIA out of Boston.
[00:21:18.016 --> 00:21:20.777]  And we were sent by internal bankers the leaked information.
[00:21:21.892 --> 00:21:26.418]  And I had perfect credit and then they say, hey group, no judge, no jury.
[00:21:26.498 --> 00:21:27.820]  This intelligence group says it.
[00:21:28.141 --> 00:21:31.145]  And then I go to the lowest credit there is.
[00:21:31.765 --> 00:21:37.894]  And so then I've got to go and literally, you know, find like offshore third world banks or whatever.
[00:21:39.226 --> 00:21:46.850]  If he'd be able to operate and to take people's orders, then of course I pay a higher percentage on the credit card transaction.
[00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:52.052]  So this is the digital gulag they put you in before they put you into the physical prison.
[00:21:52.072 --> 00:21:56.815]  So there's a process in tyranny under communists and under fascists that's being followed.
[00:21:57.335 --> 00:21:58.656]  And this is really a fascist system.
[00:21:58.676 --> 00:22:01.817]  They use communism as the operating system for the general public.
[00:22:01.857 --> 00:22:05.639]  But the merger of corporate power and state power is fascism.
[00:22:06.019 --> 00:22:06.820]  And that's what's happened here.
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:08.521]  We're sitting here with Nick Fuentes and it's happened to.
[00:22:09.221 --> 00:22:18.653]  And even if Nick Fuentes was a white supremacist or a black supremacist or whatever, or he was in Mecha or La Raza, Hispanic radical groups, he has a right to exist and have a bank account and live.
[00:22:19.685 --> 00:22:25.587]  Not have secret lists put out that then ban him across the banking industry because he's been listed as a terrorist.
[00:22:26.368 --> 00:22:28.509]  And that's what Biden has said as Operation Choke Point.
[00:22:29.049 --> 00:22:32.390]  They're going after members of Congress, like the great lady from Georgia.
[00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:38.212]  And they go, oh my gosh, she has a Gab account.
[00:22:38.312 --> 00:22:39.613]  She's talking to people.
[00:22:39.913 --> 00:22:41.053]  Well, yeah, and she's in Congress.
[00:22:41.094 --> 00:22:44.155]  So Congress has to get together and say no to this because
[00:22:44.955 --> 00:22:52.441]  They're even censoring Congressional hearings and Senate hearings with medical experts about randesivir and hydroxychloroquine and things like that.
[00:22:53.101 --> 00:22:57.384]  Since when do the corporations say what medical doctors can testify about in Congress?
[00:22:57.564 --> 00:22:58.925]  There's no end to this.
[00:22:58.945 --> 00:23:07.211]  So the first domino is the KKK, and then it's some other group, and then it's Alex Jones, and then it's Nick Fuentes, and then it's members of Congress.
[00:23:07.591 --> 00:23:08.632]  I mean, this is here.
[00:23:08.672 --> 00:23:09.313]  It's not coming.
[00:23:09.813 --> 00:23:10.133]  It's here.
[00:23:10.153 --> 00:23:11.915]  Nick Fuentes, what do you expect their next moves to be?
[00:23:12.515 --> 00:23:15.417]  Well, I expect the next move to be ratcheting up all of this.
[00:23:15.537 --> 00:23:19.539]  It's everything that we've seen since the Capitol has happened in such a short window of time.
[00:23:19.579 --> 00:23:24.181]  It was just a year ago that I don't think anybody had heard of this level of legal persecution.
[00:23:24.622 --> 00:23:26.923]  A year ago, the worst that we saw was tech censorship.
[00:23:26.963 --> 00:23:28.464]  But what you're going to see in the future...
[00:23:29.244 --> 00:23:35.792]  It's going to be major banks shutting down people's bank accounts.
[00:23:35.852 --> 00:23:41.679]  It's going to be banks shutting down corporate business accounts, which is already happening, but is going to expand.
[00:23:41.979 --> 00:23:45.223]  You're going to see more legal persecution, and they're already talking about it.
[00:23:45.543 --> 00:23:46.785]  DHS, FBI,
[00:23:47.265 --> 00:23:50.266]  Well, they've already had the Pentagon doing that and they've put out this report saying
[00:24:12.336 --> 00:24:12.816]  We're good to go.
[00:24:40.512 --> 00:24:40.872]  to know.
[00:24:58.086 --> 00:25:00.627]  But then the New York Times, if you talk about it, says you're racist and evil.
[00:25:00.647 --> 00:25:02.688]  They go, why is Alex Jones about globalism?
[00:25:03.208 --> 00:25:04.108]  That's racism.
[00:25:04.128 --> 00:25:05.088]  That's code word for something.
[00:25:05.549 --> 00:25:11.531]  No, they call themselves globalists, meaning global corporate government ruling above the law, exempt.
[00:25:11.571 --> 00:25:13.491]  So, Nick, let's talk about this.
[00:25:15.112 --> 00:25:18.073]  How do you see a coalition forming against this?
[00:25:18.973 --> 00:25:19.593]  I know you've talked about it.
[00:25:19.613 --> 00:25:20.014]  I've talked about it.
[00:25:20.234 --> 00:25:20.734]  Governors.
[00:25:21.843 --> 00:25:22.464]  Let's go.
[00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:42.132]  He said he had a sponsor a year ago that, oh, we've got a payment processor and all the systems for you.
[00:25:42.192 --> 00:25:43.592]  As long as you're not criminal, we want you.
[00:25:44.112 --> 00:25:46.693]  So I came to a sponsor and they said, no, we're not dealing with Alex Jones.
[00:25:47.214 --> 00:25:48.234]  And I said, oh, that's a fraud.
[00:25:48.274 --> 00:25:50.535]  But Bongino, that was just a sponsor.
[00:25:50.575 --> 00:25:52.675]  I didn't blame Bongino, who literally relaunched his career.
[00:25:52.936 --> 00:25:54.736]  He's a great guy, very articulate, glad he's successful.
[00:25:55.116 --> 00:25:58.518]  He won't give us the time of day now that he's the big Fox News guy, which is fine.
[00:25:59.478 --> 00:25:59.938]  But I like him.
[00:26:02.915 --> 00:26:17.010]  We've put in our applications and things with them through the system and if they don't do it, I'm going to really take action because there's only one thing more evil than big tech corporate media censoring people and blackballing people and putting us in digital ghettos and trying to destroy us.
[00:26:17.431 --> 00:26:18.172]  It's saying
[00:26:18.792 --> 00:26:23.715]  That you are America and that you are going to support freedom and you are going to back it and then not doing it.
[00:26:23.915 --> 00:26:24.836]  Which I don't think he's going to do.
[00:26:25.376 --> 00:26:27.257]  But already with his sponsor they wouldn't take us.
[00:26:27.598 --> 00:26:29.319]  He says this is his business partner and this is real.
[00:26:29.599 --> 00:26:30.620]  So we're the litmus test.
[00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:32.121]  I'm letting everybody know right here.
[00:26:32.161 --> 00:26:33.221]  Because the answer is that.
[00:26:34.542 --> 00:26:35.223]  I mean, take Gab.
[00:26:35.543 --> 00:26:41.270]  Just three, four years ago, they had the idiot white supremacist with all their stupid stuff on Facebook and Twitter.
[00:26:41.671 --> 00:26:42.872]  Almost no one was listening to them.
[00:26:43.213 --> 00:26:44.875]  Most of the stuff they were saying wasn't even true.
[00:26:45.135 --> 00:26:46.918]  They were making up and exaggerating things.
[00:26:47.118 --> 00:26:48.159]  They were lying about me.
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:50.202]  They were saying everybody was Jewish that wasn't.
[00:26:50.482 --> 00:26:50.742]  Whatever.
[00:26:51.723 --> 00:26:55.064]  It's their right to say that, you know, dinosaurs didn't exist or whatever.
[00:26:55.084 --> 00:26:56.765]  It's their right to say the Earth's flat.
[00:26:57.385 --> 00:27:05.527]  But to then extrapolate out that if you criticize Israel or a war they launched, that you're that, so you should lose your bank account, that is a tyranny.
[00:27:05.747 --> 00:27:19.611]  And so that's the Jewish lobby and the left and Israel creating a real beef with people that I don't want that is a fraud and very dangerous and being used by the big corporations to be kind of the icebreaker to get these draconian controls in place.
[00:27:20.232 --> 00:27:23.360]  Let's talk here about a strategic... spend five minutes here.
[00:27:25.045 --> 00:27:25.787]  The Liberals are close.
[00:27:26.108 --> 00:27:27.311]  Too bad they're still wearing their mask outside.
[00:27:29.024 --> 00:27:35.790]  About strategically the battle line people better choose a side because it's being corralled and intimidated And just okay.
[00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:37.371]  I won't promote the American flag.
[00:27:37.391 --> 00:27:50.361]  I won't promote borders I don't you know don't call me a name and just get over it like you've done to Carl Stunt I've done and said say this is a fraud I'm not gonna be thought policed by your intimidation because the danger of my silence is that no one's gonna know you're attacking me and
[00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:53.881]  Well, that's well said, and that is one of the biggest problems.
[00:27:53.901 --> 00:27:57.562]  It's not even just the people that are raping America and wrecking the country.
[00:27:58.103 --> 00:28:03.465]  It is the people that come out in defense, purportedly, of America and of the American people.
[00:28:03.885 --> 00:28:06.046]  But they act just the same as the enemies.
[00:28:06.386 --> 00:28:11.207]  They act as gatekeepers, they act as traitors, censors, in the same way that the enemy does.
[00:28:11.308 --> 00:28:12.228]  And they will come to you.
[00:28:13.169 --> 00:28:14.469]  A new Declaration of Independence.
[00:28:32.355 --> 00:28:32.796]  That's right.
[00:28:33.056 --> 00:28:38.621]  A new Declaration of Independence for America and define who's on our side and who's on the other side.
[00:28:38.902 --> 00:28:40.704]  The good thing is the issue is being forced.
[00:28:40.784 --> 00:28:44.748]  It's harder and harder now to obscure what you're really about.
[00:28:45.188 --> 00:28:54.177]  In other words, it's more difficult for people to hide if they're fake patriots because people are starting to see on these critical issues things like, you know, Joe Biden bowing down to Israel.
[00:28:54.938 --> 00:28:56.139]  That's forcing the issue.
[00:28:56.179 --> 00:28:59.721]  If you're America First, you would say, no matter what, there's something wrong with that.
[00:29:00.061 --> 00:29:04.584]  You know, you may not dislike Israel, you may like Israel, whatever, but there's something wrong with that.
[00:29:05.024 --> 00:29:10.728]  If you're not America First, you might defend something like that, or say that people who have a problem with that are anti-Semitic.
[00:29:11.088 --> 00:29:16.111]  So, the issue's being forced, people are waking up, but that's primarily what has to happen, is we have to identify
[00:29:16.331 --> 00:29:17.092]  America wants this.
[00:29:44.975 --> 00:29:45.556]  Absolutely.
[00:29:45.676 --> 00:29:46.617]  America wants change.
[00:29:46.637 --> 00:29:47.337]  What do you call it?
[00:29:47.397 --> 00:29:48.198]  You say it's inevitable.
[00:29:48.599 --> 00:29:49.139]  That's right.
[00:29:49.239 --> 00:29:50.720]  America first is inevitable.
[00:29:50.961 --> 00:29:53.383]  And that's because people hate the system.
[00:29:53.403 --> 00:29:54.624]  The system doesn't work for us.
[00:29:54.844 --> 00:29:57.267]  And they try to act like it's only a conservative thing or a Christian thing.
[00:29:57.587 --> 00:30:02.912]  It's a common sense thing to want free market in America and sovereignty versus global corporate fascism.
[00:30:03.530 --> 00:30:06.773]  Well, that's the wellspring that creates all the fruits of what we see here.
[00:30:06.813 --> 00:30:10.736]  You know, people say, oh, it's a white nationalist thing to want to support America.
[00:30:10.956 --> 00:30:12.137]  America benefits everybody.
[00:30:12.177 --> 00:30:15.560]  That's why everybody wants to come here, because America is a great place.
[00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:16.961]  This is Western civilization.
[00:30:17.261 --> 00:30:18.722]  This is the place that people want to be.
[00:30:19.143 --> 00:30:23.886]  Preserving that is not only in the interest of, like you said, conservatives or Christians or white people.
[00:30:24.187 --> 00:30:25.328]  It is in the interest of everybody.
[00:30:25.348 --> 00:30:29.051]  And that's why the big corporations, this is the key we just said, are demonizing Western civilization.
[00:30:29.611 --> 00:30:45.137]  Because they're exporting globalism, corporate rule, divide and conquer, eugenics, depopulation, forced inoculations, surveillance states, and an American system, and people being upwardly mobile and free, and it's not about what color you are, but it's about the character of your deeds and what you produce.
[00:30:45.637 --> 00:30:48.898]  That is totally opposed to their corporate global system.
[00:30:49.218 --> 00:30:50.339]  That's why it's got to be destroyed.
[00:30:50.879 --> 00:30:54.446]  Because they don't want Americana being exported, what I call 1776, worldwide.
[00:30:54.887 --> 00:31:01.200]  Instead, they want to demonize the idea of America and demonize anything that's associated with freedom to then outlaw freedom worldwide.
[00:31:02.236 --> 00:31:03.377]  We can't coexist.
[00:31:03.437 --> 00:31:07.561]  Western civilization cannot coexist with globalist, technocratic rule.
[00:31:07.861 --> 00:31:08.441]  They know that.
[00:31:08.521 --> 00:31:17.629]  They know that having a strong middle class, having strong families, the Constitution, the right to bear arms, can't coexist with the kind of slave state that they're trying to create.
[00:31:17.989 --> 00:31:20.471]  They want everyone to live in cities, renting everything.
[00:31:21.232 --> 00:31:30.523]  Constantly under surveillance, no privacy, no rights, and they know that that can't coexist with a system where there's manufacturing, where people own the fruits of their labor.
[00:31:30.543 --> 00:31:32.005]  Where people know how to do things.
[00:31:32.345 --> 00:31:32.565]  Right.
[00:31:32.806 --> 00:31:35.529]  It's not just that we can manufacture, it's that we know how to do it.
[00:31:36.049 --> 00:31:36.430]  You understand?
[00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:37.211]  That's what scares them.
[00:31:37.751 --> 00:31:40.433]  Absolutely, and that's why in China they're stealing the know-how.
[00:31:40.473 --> 00:31:44.437]  They build the factories over there and then Chinese know how to manufacture and create everything.
[00:31:44.857 --> 00:31:47.979]  In America, we don't know how to use anything, we don't know how to make anything.
[00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:59.429]  They're creating a docile, stupid, low IQ population of people that are not going to hold the government accountable, that are not going to resist the whims of the globalist club at Davos or various other groups.
[00:31:59.489 --> 00:32:00.670]  And now we know what comes out of that.
[00:32:01.923 --> 00:32:06.566]  Before they butchered a sheep in the EU, they hit it with electricity to stun it.
[00:32:06.646 --> 00:32:08.687]  That's ethical, they call that moral.
[00:32:08.707 --> 00:32:10.328]  Instead of just going right at it and killing them.
[00:32:11.549 --> 00:32:18.113]  And so, that's the issue is, we're being drugged and anesthetized and stunned before they move in with a final kill.
[00:32:18.573 --> 00:32:20.134]  And that's why they attack men in general.
[00:32:20.474 --> 00:32:25.817]  Because it's been men that have risen and challenged other corrupt men throughout history that bring in these tyrannies.
[00:32:25.897 --> 00:32:27.118]  If we're unable to defeat them,
[00:32:27.678 --> 00:32:31.281]  What is the timetable right now with the forced inoculations, the contact?
[00:32:31.481 --> 00:32:37.746]  People ask all over the internet, I mean we trended again like yesterday on Twitter, like how did Alex Jones predict they're coming to our houses next?
[00:32:37.766 --> 00:32:40.409]  Because they freaking said that was the plan.
[00:32:40.509 --> 00:32:46.493]  What is this thing about people where they don't want to look a year or two years ahead and then when somebody that tells them before they think it's magic.
[00:32:46.994 --> 00:32:49.076]  When it's not magic, the whole global plan is public.
[00:32:49.756 --> 00:32:50.477]  It's conformity.
[00:32:50.577 --> 00:32:56.862]  It's all about social conformity because, you're right, they're out there openly stating their agenda and they have been for years.
[00:32:56.882 --> 00:33:03.828]  They have been actually for decades and if you look hard enough, it's really not that difficult to find, you'll see exactly what they're saying about their plans for us.
[00:33:04.268 --> 00:33:13.536]  The problem is that people watch TV and they watch NBC and they watch Fox and CBS and all of that and if nobody else is saying that at their workplace or their school or on TV,
[00:33:14.377 --> 00:33:15.858]  Hi there, thanks for taking my questions.
[00:33:15.938 --> 00:33:17.459]  I'm wondering about the injunction
[00:33:42.273 --> 00:33:42.554]  Thank you.
[00:33:51.916 --> 00:33:53.117]  I mean, I think it's still there.
[00:33:53.197 --> 00:33:58.442]  We still have, you know, bringing large numbers of people together.
[00:33:58.462 --> 00:34:01.745]  It can present some risk.
[00:34:01.805 --> 00:34:03.207]  We'll continue to look at that.
[00:34:04.348 --> 00:34:17.640]  But I think the other purpose of the injunction is to prevent, you know, groups that are deliberately spreading false information that can actually create risk.
[00:34:18.180 --> 00:34:21.745]  The information itself, if listened to, creates risk to the public as well.
[00:34:22.465 --> 00:34:27.351]  And that certainly is a need to manage that misinformation campaign as well.
[00:34:27.972 --> 00:34:28.853]  I mean, here's an example.
[00:34:28.933 --> 00:34:30.616]  This is a liberal area of Austin, Kentucky.
[00:34:32.950 --> 00:34:37.431]  Those folks, two guys came in, they saw who I was, they're like 20 feet away, they got up and left.
[00:34:37.911 --> 00:34:40.572]  Because the left does not want to hear any outside ideas.
[00:34:40.612 --> 00:34:44.913]  It's like Fauci says, I am science, don't question me, even though all the science says he's a fraud.
[00:34:44.933 --> 00:34:45.613]  Sorry to interrupt, go ahead.
[00:34:45.893 --> 00:34:47.793]  No, you're absolutely right, and it's true.
[00:34:47.833 --> 00:34:49.114]  People don't want to hear these ideas.
[00:34:49.154 --> 00:34:52.695]  People don't want to hear, they don't want to trust their own eyes, they don't want to trust their own ears.
[00:34:53.375 --> 00:34:56.575]  People want to go about their lives, get pumped full of chemicals, they want to go out and party.
[00:34:56.595 --> 00:34:57.776]  That is people already in the trance.
[00:34:57.796 --> 00:34:58.636]  How do we get them out of the trance?
[00:34:59.673 --> 00:35:03.416]  Well, I think there are enough people that are out of it, but basically we have to bring the message to them.
[00:35:03.456 --> 00:35:04.437]  We have to provoke them.
[00:35:04.477 --> 00:35:05.498]  We have to agitate them.
[00:35:05.538 --> 00:35:09.842]  Not in a way that's violent or illegal or anything like that, but we've got to make our voices heard.
[00:35:09.862 --> 00:35:10.743]  We've got to be vocal.
[00:35:10.923 --> 00:35:13.846]  You know, for example, the Stop the Steal movement was working.
[00:35:13.906 --> 00:35:17.769]  That's why they came up with that Capitol false flag on January 6th.
[00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:23.534]  Because you had patriots coming out to the Capitol, peacefully assembling, protesting, streaming.
[00:35:24.235 --> 00:35:28.178]  In every state capitol for months after the November 3rd election.
[00:35:28.258 --> 00:35:35.162]  And I think that terrified them because people were coming out and they weren't saying, you know, rah, rah, rah, vote for Republicans and don't vote for Democrats.
[00:35:35.443 --> 00:35:37.764]  They were coming out and saying the whole system is rigged.
[00:35:37.784 --> 00:35:39.125]  The whole system is illegitimate.
[00:35:39.525 --> 00:35:40.606]  They stole the election.
[00:35:41.086 --> 00:35:44.268]  Not just the government, not just the party, but the corporations too.
[00:35:44.589 --> 00:35:47.811]  And they came out and said that in Time Magazine about a month after the inauguration.
[00:35:47.851 --> 00:35:53.274]  They said, this was the big global conspiracy to fix the election, to quote unquote, save democracy.
[00:35:54.555 --> 00:35:56.736]  Isn't that the great part, though, is the criminals love to brag?
[00:35:57.037 --> 00:36:04.281]  Oh yeah, and well, that makes it, I think, a little bit easier for us because, you know, I know you went on Joe Rogan recently and it was a little bit funny.
[00:36:04.321 --> 00:36:07.082]  He said, oh, you know, let's get a fact check on that, let's get a fact check on that.
[00:36:07.523 --> 00:36:14.106]  And every single thing that Alex Jones says, fact check comes back and says, oh, he's right about this, he's right about this, he's right about that, he's right about that.
[00:36:14.547 --> 00:36:19.630]  And so if we have the level playing field, if we have basically the megaphone to get the message out there,
[00:36:20.350 --> 00:36:29.794]  Anybody who listens and is reasonable and is willing to come out of the trance will be able to do that because the facts at this point are unambiguous, indisputable, maybe more so than ever before.
[00:36:30.694 --> 00:36:31.574]  That's right.
[00:36:31.954 --> 00:36:34.675]  This is about trance breaking.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:47.042]  If you had to see this as a football game at halftime, where is free humanity versus the technocrats versus the psychotic big tech bankers that are admittedly eugenicists?
[00:36:47.082 --> 00:36:48.622]  I mean, because that's the crazy thing.
[00:36:48.642 --> 00:36:50.062]  They're the ultimate anti-humans.
[00:36:50.082 --> 00:36:50.982]  They're beyond just racist.
[00:36:51.002 --> 00:36:52.803]  They think the general public's all scum.
[00:36:53.223 --> 00:36:56.603]  They believe the social Darwinism, the fact that they're in power means they can rule everybody.
[00:36:56.843 --> 00:37:03.344]  They write books saying we need to get rid of everybody, but then, oh, they love us, please take their shot, which admittedly is hurting so many people.
[00:37:04.925 --> 00:37:05.825]  How would you describe
[00:37:06.909 --> 00:37:10.390]  The unipolar world, because I don't just see it as China and the U.S.
[00:37:10.410 --> 00:37:16.552]  as a political unipolar world, but the real ideological, is it unipolar, is it multi-tripolar, quad-polar?
[00:37:16.912 --> 00:37:20.794]  I mean, what are the dominant polls, good versus evil, obviously is a way to see it.
[00:37:22.745 --> 00:37:25.426]  Through what lens do you look at it beyond America first?
[00:37:25.446 --> 00:37:26.966]  Because, you know, America's important.
[00:37:26.986 --> 00:37:28.347]  We're 5% of the world population.
[00:37:28.387 --> 00:37:33.689]  But how do we reach out to others, liberal, conservative, old, young, gay, straight?
[00:37:33.789 --> 00:37:34.489]  I love everybody.
[00:37:35.689 --> 00:37:37.990]  I want to not transcend Trump.
[00:37:38.650 --> 00:37:42.372]  I just want to let people know that this is bigger than all these labels.
[00:37:42.392 --> 00:37:45.393]  And if they can trick us just to fight with each other over labels, they win.
[00:37:46.806 --> 00:37:50.347]  That they create their false unity and say, don't have labels, but then they reimpose labels.
[00:37:51.408 --> 00:37:56.110]  That's a false form of liberalism, but you would call it, I would call it, the Founding Fathers, classical liberals.
[00:37:57.350 --> 00:38:01.312]  And so, what is a classical liberal versus a modern liberal?
[00:38:01.332 --> 00:38:02.292]  That's a lot I just threw out there.
[00:38:02.998 --> 00:38:08.122]  Well, first on the question of sort of internationally, I think that nationalism is rising worldwide.
[00:38:08.202 --> 00:38:09.143]  This is indisputable.
[00:38:09.884 --> 00:38:28.119]  At the time of the 2016 election, of course, you've got Donald Trump in America, but at the same time you have Brexit in the UK, you've got Matteo Salvini in Italy over the past five years, you've got Poland and Hungary becoming far more conservative, and specifically Orban in Hungary articulating a new vision of Christian nationalism in Europe, which is
[00:38:28.379 --> 00:38:28.539]  Germany.
[00:38:28.559 --> 00:38:28.759]  Millions.
[00:38:51.129 --> 00:38:51.449]  Germany, yeah.
[00:38:51.989 --> 00:38:54.691]  Millions and millions of people not covered by the mainstream media.
[00:38:54.751 --> 00:38:59.093]  And so, you know, and to get even to the question about, you know, if we're in the halftime, where are we?
[00:38:59.453 --> 00:39:04.796]  I think it's closer than a lot of people think, and it's definitely closer than the globalists would like to let on.
[00:39:05.436 --> 00:39:10.659]  Patriots are rising up, and if we can achieve something like the Donald Trump election, and when you look at what's going on in Europe,
[00:39:11.039 --> 00:39:12.541]  They'll never cover that in the media.
[00:39:12.601 --> 00:39:17.167]  They'll never write a big piece about that in the New Yorker about how, you know, globalists are on the ropes.
[00:39:17.408 --> 00:39:18.129]  But they really are.
[00:39:18.149 --> 00:39:19.891]  And that's why they're acting out so desperately.
[00:39:19.951 --> 00:39:23.175]  That's why they're making these dramatic and very visible moves.
[00:39:23.235 --> 00:39:26.480]  Well, before they made their draconian move four and a half years ago when he won,
[00:39:27.472 --> 00:39:29.474]  They said globalism actually is in trouble.
[00:39:29.514 --> 00:39:30.174]  We're falling apart.
[00:39:30.214 --> 00:39:33.197]  We've got to organize and take speech and really move against everybody.
[00:39:33.397 --> 00:39:34.878]  So they did do a few articles, you're right.
[00:39:35.219 --> 00:39:36.760]  But since then, they put on the Confidence Act.
[00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:40.743]  But in the Financial Times in London, other places, they actually did hit the alarm button.
[00:39:41.164 --> 00:39:41.624]  Yeah, well, yeah.
[00:39:41.684 --> 00:39:43.546]  And they called it the democracy deficit.
[00:39:43.586 --> 00:39:46.228]  And they talked about the European Union was failing as a project.
[00:39:46.673 --> 00:39:47.773]  And things of that nature.
[00:39:48.054 --> 00:39:48.554]  So you're right.
[00:39:48.594 --> 00:39:51.055]  Years ago, they were saying, oh, well, you know, we might be in some trouble.
[00:39:51.355 --> 00:39:55.196]  And ever since Trump rose up, now they have to say, oh, well, that's terrorism.
[00:39:55.577 --> 00:39:58.038]  Now it's the pretext for total globalism.
[00:39:58.098 --> 00:39:59.278]  And doesn't that show they're losing?
[00:39:59.318 --> 00:40:02.399]  That now they're calling, questioning election, or questioning lockdown of terrorism?
[00:40:02.439 --> 00:40:02.619]  Yes.
[00:40:02.639 --> 00:40:04.140]  And the official government policy?
[00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:06.041]  I mean, to me, that shows weakness, not strength.
[00:40:06.461 --> 00:40:06.821]  It does.
[00:40:06.881 --> 00:40:07.201]  It does.
[00:40:07.241 --> 00:40:12.463]  Because if they were truly strong, if they really had control over the narrative, they wouldn't have to worry about it.
[00:40:12.503 --> 00:40:13.864]  But ultimately, I think it was
[00:40:14.204 --> 00:40:23.870]  Confluence of different factors, maybe social media being one of them, but their monopoly over information, their monopoly over the sort of dialectic of politics, has been totally shattered and broken.
[00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:41.961]  And that's why it's revolutionary to take this interview and share it, and tune into my show, tune into his nightly show, and to realize that just that revolutionary act of, on your email list, on your text message, that's where they're having trouble censoring, or on Facebook, or on Twitter, or on YouTube, taking these clips, using this, it's all free to air,
[00:40:43.243 --> 00:40:44.383]  Getting it out on Instagram.
[00:40:44.423 --> 00:40:45.164]  Getting it out on Twitter.
[00:40:45.184 --> 00:40:45.864]  I see you doing it.
[00:40:46.604 --> 00:40:49.825]  And really, having a debate, that's how we're going to win.
[00:40:50.006 --> 00:40:52.807]  In closing, I want people to learn how they can find you.
[00:40:52.827 --> 00:40:55.668]  It's not as though when you see a Nick Fuentes clip, you watch it.
[00:40:55.788 --> 00:40:58.809]  It's when you believe in something, you know it's important, you promote it.
[00:40:59.109 --> 00:41:00.349]  That's 90% of the power.
[00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:03.170]  10% of us, 10% is us taking action.
[00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:08.372]  90% is you deciding to pay it forward and your real power turning that loose.
[00:41:08.392 --> 00:41:09.733]  But we were talking about this.
[00:41:10.728 --> 00:41:12.789]  I'm going to play a clip of this right now as we're taping this.
[00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:19.293]  The official orchestra of the symphony in San Francisco is now gay.
[00:41:20.794 --> 00:41:21.615]  It calls itself that.
[00:41:21.735 --> 00:41:23.736]  And they say, we're coming for your children.
[00:41:23.756 --> 00:41:24.557]  We're recruiting them.
[00:41:24.577 --> 00:41:25.537]  We're going to take them over.
[00:41:25.557 --> 00:41:26.358]  They will work for us.
[00:41:26.398 --> 00:41:27.279]  They will be our slaves.
[00:41:27.299 --> 00:41:27.959]  They actually say this.
[00:41:28.639 --> 00:41:29.740]  Total declaration of war.
[00:41:30.841 --> 00:41:32.062]  And all it is is a cult.
[00:41:32.898 --> 00:41:42.580]  That controls the media, that the corporation uses the rainbow flag as their power, knowing that people are open and free and are like, sure, I'm not against you, but it's not about that.
[00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:45.500]  It's about a globalist corporate agenda that's wrapped itself in it.
[00:41:45.961 --> 00:41:49.641]  And in this video, they are declaring, we're coming.
[00:41:49.981 --> 00:41:50.801]  The future is ours.
[00:41:50.861 --> 00:41:51.802]  Your children belong to us.
[00:41:52.122 --> 00:41:56.643]  This is a group of men saying, we are going to form sexual relationships with your children.
[00:41:57.203 --> 00:41:58.423]  This is pedophilic.
[00:41:59.178 --> 00:42:05.968]  We are grooming the new generation of Americans to be fully embracing of diversity and inclusivity.
[00:42:06.604 --> 00:42:12.007]  And for the children and the people that support it are going to realize that this is going to be the grooming of the next generation.
[00:42:12.267 --> 00:42:17.590]  That's the whole goal is to make kids that aren't used to seeing something like me more comfortable to seeing it.
[00:42:17.811 --> 00:42:20.932]  No one's there to push an agenda on anyone.
[00:42:21.413 --> 00:42:26.115]  No one's there to persuade people or to recruit people.
[00:42:26.316 --> 00:42:28.557]  Who wants to be a drag queen when they grow up?
[00:42:28.737 --> 00:42:30.438]  You could be a drag queen superhero!
[00:42:30.798 --> 00:42:32.899]  Learn to love, learn to vogue, face your fate!
[00:42:34.895 --> 00:42:35.776]  We're good to go.
[00:43:02.375 --> 00:43:07.038]  Your children will care about fairness and justice for others.
[00:43:07.658 --> 00:43:12.242]  Your children will work to convert all the sisters and brothers.
[00:43:12.602 --> 00:43:20.908]  Then soon we're almost certain your kids will start converting.
[00:43:29.667 --> 00:43:31.248]  We're good to go.
[00:43:59.213 --> 00:44:01.394]  We'll convert your children.
[00:44:02.714 --> 00:44:03.694]  Then we'll turn to you.
[00:44:03.734 --> 00:44:09.936]  Giving up the fear inside is freeing like you never knew.
[00:44:09.976 --> 00:44:12.497]  Go and see San Francisco.
[00:44:12.537 --> 00:44:14.738]  Go and turn up that disco.
[00:44:14.758 --> 00:44:19.739]  You'll forget you were ever upset.
[00:44:20.079 --> 00:44:21.760]  We'll convert your children.
[00:44:41.124 --> 00:44:48.790]  And we have to warn you, ladies and gentlemen, if you've got young or impressionable children in your household, bring them to the screen right now.
[00:44:49.851 --> 00:44:54.936]  And we witnessed parents taking their children, as young as two, inside to take part.
[00:44:55.056 --> 00:44:56.877]  Talking, singing, and reading.
[00:44:57.498 --> 00:44:58.939]  We can both be grooms.
[00:44:59.039 --> 00:45:02.142]  To an audience of preschoolers, toddlers, and their caregivers.
[00:45:02.702 --> 00:45:03.823]  Family programming!
[00:45:05.104 --> 00:45:05.785]  Love it!
[00:45:05.965 --> 00:45:06.385]  Yas!
[00:45:06.505 --> 00:45:15.373]  We have just confirmed that a registered child sex offender has been reading to children at a Houston Public Library as part of its Drag Queen Story Hour.
[00:45:15.633 --> 00:45:24.021]  A media spokesperson for the library confirms one of those drag queens, Tatiana Malanina, is really Alberto Garza, a child sex offender.
[00:45:24.361 --> 00:45:27.624]  In 2008, he was convicted of assaulting an 8-year-old boy.
[00:45:27.884 --> 00:45:30.708]  This is Tatiana Balina, my sister from Queens of the Week.
[00:45:30.729 --> 00:45:33.112]  People seem to walk away having a good time.
[00:45:33.212 --> 00:45:34.234]  A stardom young, right?
[00:45:34.474 --> 00:45:36.117]  A stardom young, right?
[00:45:36.377 --> 00:45:39.702]  Now, does anybody in this room know how to twerk?
[00:45:40.183 --> 00:45:42.587]  And that really is the driving engine.
[00:45:43.484 --> 00:45:44.084]  of the system.
[00:45:44.124 --> 00:45:46.725]  I knew Ted Gunderson, former top FBI agent.
[00:45:46.745 --> 00:45:48.505]  They wanted him to be the FBI Director.
[00:45:48.525 --> 00:45:50.606]  He was the head of the whole Southern California sector.
[00:45:51.226 --> 00:45:54.206]  I knew General Benton K. Partin, head of Air Force Weapons Development.
[00:45:55.147 --> 00:46:00.108]  I had family that was in the Iran-Contra and stuff in Central and South America.
[00:46:00.748 --> 00:46:09.270]  And they all told me when I was a kid, my uncle and people when I was a kid, but then these other guys, I was on air when I was 22, like this guy, and they would come through and speak and they would not have dinner with him and they'd say,
[00:46:09.994 --> 00:46:10.814]  It's devil worshippers.
[00:46:11.414 --> 00:46:14.275]  They use it as a mind control system to get people recruited.
[00:46:14.795 --> 00:46:18.816]  And then once they've had sex with somebody's wife and they have it with an underage girl, then it's a little kid.
[00:46:18.836 --> 00:46:21.717]  Then they got to kill a kid because you know, this kid's a troublemaker.
[00:46:22.797 --> 00:46:23.797]  So, you know, you're compromised.
[00:46:23.837 --> 00:46:24.938]  Well, all that's come out now.
[00:46:25.618 --> 00:46:27.798]  And so they're really externalizing this whole method.
[00:46:27.838 --> 00:46:30.739]  And it really is a horrible, sick operating system that took over the Vatican.
[00:46:31.039 --> 00:46:35.022]  That took over Penn State, that took over basically everything, the FBI, you name it.
[00:46:35.402 --> 00:46:42.368]  And so that's why they're doing this, is because this is a cult of sickos that are literally high on sucking the energy off children.
[00:46:42.928 --> 00:46:44.449]  This is vampirism, folks.
[00:46:44.910 --> 00:46:46.191]  This is psychic vampire stuff.
[00:46:46.631 --> 00:46:48.733]  And so physical vampires aren't real.
[00:46:48.973 --> 00:46:53.296]  They're archetypes, Bram Stoker said that, of real people that were doing bad things.
[00:46:53.797 --> 00:46:54.977]  So there's always been these type of folks.
[00:46:55.898 --> 00:47:00.842]  And that's one of the old Transylvanian legends, they said, don't get near the castle, they'll grab you and eat you.
[00:47:01.363 --> 00:47:03.807]  Well, because the elites turned out were rabid kids and eating them.
[00:47:03.827 --> 00:47:04.708]  That's in the history books now.
[00:47:05.489 --> 00:47:09.655]  And so you've got these domesticated people that don't realize how much danger they're in.
[00:47:10.416 --> 00:47:13.100]  And there's these super predators that are organizing these hierarchies.
[00:47:13.686 --> 00:47:14.767]  of Super Predator Control.
[00:47:15.888 --> 00:47:18.549]  And everybody else is just scared, wanting to conform, conform, conform.
[00:47:18.890 --> 00:47:21.151]  Anything outside their Netflix scares them, they want to run away from it.
[00:47:21.391 --> 00:47:24.574]  So just in closing, speak to that, and why these criminals love to brag.
[00:47:25.374 --> 00:47:30.678]  They first put out that video, and after it got about a million views and 99% downvotes, they removed it off YouTube.
[00:47:31.018 --> 00:47:32.399]  We saved it, it's a banned video.
[00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:37.863]  But again, that shows they're miscalculating, they can't help it, they're still pushing it.
[00:47:38.303 --> 00:47:38.683]  That's right.
[00:47:38.703 --> 00:47:47.325]  Well, across the country you've seen this gay agenda being pushed, and specifically over the past five years, it's ratcheted up way beyond, I think, what anybody even thought possible.
[00:47:47.805 --> 00:47:56.367]  Years ago it started with this push for gay marriage or tolerance or something like this, and quite literally now you've got them saying, we're going to convert your kids, we're going to come for your kids.
[00:47:56.887 --> 00:48:00.808]  And these people are, like you said, predator, pedophile, vampire types.
[00:48:01.248 --> 00:48:04.649]  It's not about tolerance, it's not about love, it's not about anything like that.
[00:48:05.229 --> 00:48:06.150]  It's about destroying innocence.
[00:48:06.390 --> 00:48:06.830]  That's right.
[00:48:06.910 --> 00:48:08.871]  It's about psychic vampirism.
[00:48:09.211 --> 00:48:11.953]  It's about literal Satanism, which is what these elites are.
[00:48:11.993 --> 00:48:19.457]  They're evil people, and they're using the energy of the young and maybe the most evil thing that's happening in the world to power this empire that they're trying to create.
[00:48:19.897 --> 00:48:20.857]  And it's all out there.
[00:48:20.877 --> 00:48:22.698]  I mean, just take a look at, like, Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:48:22.758 --> 00:48:24.019]  This is something that's mainstream.
[00:48:24.539 --> 00:48:28.681]  What was incredible about Jeffrey Epstein is, here's a case where it couldn't have been more obvious.
[00:48:28.741 --> 00:48:30.102]  This is something that everybody knew.
[00:48:30.122 --> 00:48:32.563]  It was basically like an open secret for 20 or 30 years.
[00:48:33.644 --> 00:48:34.565]  Finally they caught him.
[00:48:34.585 --> 00:48:35.406]  They threw him in jail.
[00:48:36.067 --> 00:48:38.669]  The government kills him because maybe he knows too much or something.
[00:48:38.949 --> 00:48:40.411]  And they turn it into a big punchline.
[00:48:40.451 --> 00:48:41.472]  They turn it into a joke.
[00:48:41.512 --> 00:48:43.734]  And they say, Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself.
[00:48:44.115 --> 00:48:46.217]  And they say that on the network talk shows.
[00:48:46.257 --> 00:48:48.099]  And they say that on Reddit and everywhere else.
[00:48:48.439 --> 00:48:50.221]  And it turns into a big punchline for a joke.
[00:48:50.541 --> 00:48:51.302]  It's not a punchline.
[00:48:51.342 --> 00:48:51.982]  It's not a joke.
[00:48:52.343 --> 00:48:52.863]  It's real.
[00:48:52.923 --> 00:48:54.445]  Take a look at who was on the flight logs.
[00:48:54.485 --> 00:48:55.005]  Take a look at
[00:48:55.686 --> 00:49:00.712]  Kevin Spacey, take a look at his girlfriend, Delaine Maxwell, and who she was connected to.
[00:49:01.033 --> 00:49:03.576]  All the different global governments and Hollywood and things like that.
[00:49:03.977 --> 00:49:04.657]  It's not a joke.
[00:49:04.697 --> 00:49:05.518]  It's not a punchline.
[00:49:05.579 --> 00:49:06.099]  It's not a meme.
[00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:08.342]  These are the people that are running the world right now.
[00:49:08.522 --> 00:49:09.243]  That's the evil.
[00:49:09.283 --> 00:49:10.405]  That's the level that they're on.
[00:49:10.865 --> 00:49:15.747]  And folks that sign on to defending this or sign on to censoring us, you've now signed on to all this evil.
[00:49:16.068 --> 00:49:18.068]  The human-animal cloning out in the open, all of it.
[00:49:18.429 --> 00:49:20.029]  You can find us at band.video.
[00:49:20.049 --> 00:49:21.990]  But that URL is banned on Twitter and Facebook.
[00:49:22.371 --> 00:49:23.371]  Band.video.
[00:49:23.391 --> 00:49:24.271]  You can't share that URL.
[00:49:24.572 --> 00:49:27.753]  But we have a URL that is freeworldnews.tv.
[00:49:27.793 --> 00:49:28.453]  It's on screen.
[00:49:28.493 --> 00:49:30.174]  Freeworldnews.tv.
[00:49:30.234 --> 00:49:30.735]  Freeworldnews.tv.
[00:49:32.182 --> 00:49:35.483]  And that has all the same URLs, all the same videos, all the same links.
[00:49:35.523 --> 00:49:39.845]  He has a page, Nick Fuentes does, at ban.video or freeworldnews.tv.
[00:49:39.865 --> 00:49:43.587]  When they ban freeworldnews.tv, we'll come up with a new URL that does the same indexing system.
[00:49:43.927 --> 00:49:45.327]  You can find me weekdays at 11 a.m.
[00:49:45.367 --> 00:49:46.008]  to 3 p.m.
[00:49:46.028 --> 00:49:49.209]  at the other great shows, again, that we host out of the InfoWars News Center.
[00:49:49.229 --> 00:49:50.229]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:49:50.789 --> 00:49:54.331]  Nick, you definitely are very embattled, as much as I am, maybe even more.
[00:49:55.231 --> 00:49:58.873]  And even if I disagree with you politically, which I don't, 99% of things,
[00:50:01.926 --> 00:50:02.026]  Yeah.
[00:50:16.345 --> 00:50:19.686]  Pro-free speech and nationalism and a real stalwart.
[00:50:20.547 --> 00:50:22.547]  So tell folks how they can support you, how they can follow you.
[00:50:22.787 --> 00:50:30.130]  You can find my show at AmericaFirst.live and that's Monday through Friday at 8 o'clock Central Time and also on NicholasJFuentes.com.
[00:50:30.450 --> 00:50:35.112]  Thanks so much for meeting me out here for breakfast and likewise you become a symbol for freedom in the world.
[00:50:35.712 --> 00:50:37.853]  I think we're going to take it back in the next five to ten years.
[00:50:37.993 --> 00:50:38.233]  That's right.
[00:50:38.253 --> 00:50:39.134]  They want to intimidate us.
[00:50:39.174 --> 00:50:44.956]  They want to take these icons of liberty and destroy them and make it their symbol to make everybody ashamed of freedom.
[00:50:44.976 --> 00:50:47.598]  But we can take the symbols back and celebrate those symbols.
[00:50:48.378 --> 00:50:50.279]  And so I personally am ready to go to prison or die.
[00:50:51.391 --> 00:50:54.974]  Because I believe that we're going to win this, and I know spiritually it's my job to fight this.
[00:50:55.034 --> 00:50:56.415]  Even in my lifetime, I don't see victory.
[00:50:56.495 --> 00:51:00.559]  But instead, we have a chance to see it very, very soon, actually, if good just rallies.
[00:51:00.579 --> 00:51:02.781]  And that's why evil is so desperate, because it knows it's losing.
[00:51:03.201 --> 00:51:12.289]  And just to see people on Twitter and Instagram and Facebook, you know, defending me, defending Nick and rallying and using our names as an example of saying, I don't buy your fraud.
[00:51:12.949 --> 00:51:13.229]  Thank you.
[00:51:36.826 --> 00:51:37.806]  I'm at war with tyranny.
[00:51:38.667 --> 00:51:40.387]  But it doesn't mean that I have all the answers.
[00:51:40.407 --> 00:51:42.748]  It doesn't mean that I figured out every way to defeat them.
[00:51:43.028 --> 00:51:43.608]  But I know this.
[00:51:44.488 --> 00:51:57.713]  If we reduce our signature, if we take these cell phones that have all these great attributes and all these great services, but also track, trace, and spy on us, and if we lock them up in a little Faraday cage, like the little devils they are,
[00:51:58.613 --> 00:51:59.634]  They can't track us.
[00:51:59.674 --> 00:52:00.594]  They can't trace us.
[00:52:00.935 --> 00:52:10.401]  They can't use that data against us for contact tracers, the UN, Joe Biden's people coming to your doors, but also hackers and regular criminals.
[00:52:10.941 --> 00:52:12.702]  So what I do, and I've got a black one.
[00:52:12.722 --> 00:52:13.303]  I've got a red one.
[00:52:13.323 --> 00:52:14.163]  I also have it in blue.
[00:52:14.744 --> 00:52:17.005]  I put my little devilish cell phone in it.
[00:52:17.486 --> 00:52:21.648]  And it also reminds me of how powerful the phone is and how it's surveilling me.
[00:52:21.688 --> 00:52:26.352]  And it makes me reduce my phone time and spend more time with my family.
[00:52:26.772 --> 00:52:27.813]  So when I'm driving in a car.
[00:52:28.893 --> 00:52:38.920]  Or, when I'm going to church, or when I'm at the grocery store, or when I'm not going to use this thing, or I go to bed at night, I remind myself it's a two-edged sword, and I put it right inside this container.
[00:52:38.980 --> 00:52:41.442]  Now, we've been sold out of these for months.
[00:52:42.369 --> 00:52:45.172]  Because of the supply chain breakdowns with the fake COVID lockdowns.
[00:52:45.192 --> 00:52:49.557]  But finally, we got in some big shipments of these babies.
[00:52:50.118 --> 00:52:52.941]  And so I want to encourage you to take action and get off the fence and get them.
[00:52:53.562 --> 00:53:02.513]  Normally we sell them at $19.95, which is massively discounted from $29.95 that this exact same high quality Faraday cage sells all day long.
[00:53:02.933 --> 00:53:11.459]  We're selling it for the first time, 50% off, $14.95 at InfoWarsTore.com in four colors, black, red, blue, and green.
[00:53:11.979 --> 00:53:14.161]  We've got a bunch of black, a bunch of red, a bunch of blue.
[00:53:14.201 --> 00:53:15.422]  The green is almost sold out.
[00:53:15.902 --> 00:53:16.803]  They're $14.95.
[00:53:17.383 --> 00:53:19.885]  They're a great gift for friends and family.
[00:53:20.145 --> 00:53:21.506]  They're a great conversation piece.
[00:53:21.846 --> 00:53:25.749]  They're all available, massively discounted, at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:53:26.189 --> 00:53:29.870]  Let's start taking back control of our lives by becoming conscious.
[00:53:30.210 --> 00:53:34.992]  Let's put these little devilish spy systems in a cage, except when we decide to use them.
[00:53:36.613 --> 00:53:38.653]  I never had a marketing plan for InfoWars.
[00:53:39.093 --> 00:53:43.075]  I went out and found the best products I could find from the research to fund our operation.
[00:53:43.355 --> 00:53:47.896]  I wanted you to get products that empowered you, that you loved, so you'd want to come back and buy more.
[00:53:48.036 --> 00:53:49.437]  I treat you like I want to be treated.
[00:53:49.597 --> 00:53:50.517]  It's very, very simple.
[00:53:50.597 --> 00:53:51.297]  It's instinctive.
[00:53:51.598 --> 00:53:52.138]  It's spiritual.
[00:53:52.178 --> 00:53:52.678]  It's what I do.
[00:53:52.938 --> 00:53:56.181]  And that said, our iodine products have become our best sellers.
[00:53:56.361 --> 00:54:03.286]  And X2 right now is discounted because listeners and viewers are habituated to only buy it when it's on sale.
[00:54:03.867 --> 00:54:04.527]  And so I'm in a catch-22.
[00:54:04.567 --> 00:54:07.029]  When I don't have it on sale, I don't sell it.
[00:54:07.309 --> 00:54:11.553]  But we're selling out of all our other products because of supply chain breakdowns, and so I'm in a catch-22.
[00:54:12.213 --> 00:54:14.235]  I need to sell products at full price, but I can't.
[00:54:14.555 --> 00:54:15.576]  I've got to sell them at discount.
[00:54:16.036 --> 00:54:22.362]  And so, it's discounted 40% off for the dropper bottle, 60% off for the spray bottle, even though it's about to sell out.
[00:54:22.683 --> 00:54:23.844]  It won't be available for months.
[00:54:24.284 --> 00:54:24.805]  So get it.
[00:54:25.285 --> 00:54:31.651]  X2 is selling out at InfoWareStore.com for 40 and 60% off with double Patreon points and free shipping.
[00:54:31.891 --> 00:54:32.472]  Because why?
[00:54:32.852 --> 00:54:33.613]  That's when you buy it.
[00:54:33.873 --> 00:54:35.375]  We need your funds or we'll be off air.
[00:54:35.395 --> 00:54:36.296]  It's an amazing product.
[00:54:51.764 --> 00:54:52.547]  InfoWars.
[00:54:52.888 --> 00:54:53.771]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:54:54.092 --> 00:54:54.413]  Today.
[00:54:56.295 --> 00:54:58.256]  And it is Saturday, July 10th.
[00:54:58.297 --> 00:55:06.802]  The year is 2021, and I have a fellow Austinite, formerly from New York, Michael Malice, here with his amazing crew and his lovely girlfriend.
[00:55:06.842 --> 00:55:08.364]  Had a chance to have dinner with him last night.
[00:55:08.384 --> 00:55:08.864]  That was great.
[00:55:09.304 --> 00:55:13.287]  And here he is in studio with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:55:13.907 --> 00:55:15.448]  Wow, so much to talk about.
[00:55:15.669 --> 00:55:18.050]  That hour and 15 minutes went by so quick yesterday.
[00:55:18.731 --> 00:55:19.892]  You wanted it, I wanted it.
[00:55:19.952 --> 00:55:21.132]  And first, it's great to have you back.
[00:55:21.172 --> 00:55:21.573]  Thank you, sir.
[00:55:21.913 --> 00:55:23.334]  It just seems like minutes ago we were here.
[00:55:25.215 --> 00:55:33.561]  Getting into, growing up in the Soviet Union, coming here, the Russian perspective on what's happening in America.
[00:55:33.941 --> 00:55:43.908]  Yeah, one thing that I love to do is when you go on Twitter and social media and see some of the tactics that the corporate press, or you would call the globalists, I guess, use.
[00:55:43.928 --> 00:55:46.050]  Like, let's use an example of Greta Thunberg, right?
[00:55:46.830 --> 00:56:01.375]  The idea that any of us, whatever your opinions are on climate change, the idea that you're going to take the word of some high school dropout who has opinions on the weather is something that I think most people in other contexts would regard as nonsensical.
[00:56:01.775 --> 00:56:09.878]  But at the same time, we would all say, look, if you've got a kid who has political opinions, you're not going to go up to this kid and shout them down and call them horrible names.
[00:56:09.938 --> 00:56:10.438]  It's a kid.
[00:56:10.478 --> 00:56:11.478]  You kind of feel nice.
[00:56:11.858 --> 00:56:18.781]  So they leverage children in a way that kind of is similar to Hamas, but at least Hamas expects you to do something about it.
[00:56:19.081 --> 00:56:20.321]  You see it with Gerrit Tonberg.
[00:56:20.341 --> 00:56:24.423]  You see it with David Hogg and some of these other kids that came out of the Florida shooting.
[00:56:25.203 --> 00:56:29.005]  And, you know, what they do is they take these puppets.
[00:56:29.445 --> 00:56:33.867]  You and I remember, I'm sure, very well, during the Iraq War, they had Cindy Sheehan.
[00:56:34.287 --> 00:56:38.048]  Cindy Sheehan was a mom whose son died in the Iraq War.
[00:56:38.248 --> 00:56:39.029]  Horrible tragedy.
[00:56:39.069 --> 00:56:41.870]  This is something I would wish on absolutely no one, almost.
[00:56:42.410 --> 00:56:44.531]  And she was on every show for every five minutes.
[00:56:45.091 --> 00:56:56.813]  As if she's the only mom who lost a son, as if she's the only person who has perspective, but she's useful to them because she's in a position to say what they can pretend to be objective and they're not going to be able to say.
[00:56:57.313 --> 00:57:00.654]  Now, she's a trivia question because she served her purpose.
[00:57:01.034 --> 00:57:02.554]  The same thing you see with these kids.
[00:57:02.594 --> 00:57:11.536]  And I think the thing is when you come from a Russian background, you know, I did come here when I was two, but we were certainly raised in a Russian household, is you see these tactics at face value.
[00:57:12.716 --> 00:57:13.497]  And what they are.
[00:57:13.577 --> 00:57:21.260]  And it's kind of surprising when I see Americans feel the need to engage with the views of a child.
[00:57:21.961 --> 00:57:25.462]  And she was named Time Magazine's Person of the Year, I'm sure you remember last year.
[00:57:25.542 --> 00:57:32.246]  It's like, so some girl from overseas has an opinion on climate change and now we're supposed to care about this?
[00:57:32.486 --> 00:57:35.087]  It's a very bizarre situation where
[00:57:35.547 --> 00:57:48.950]  If you haven't been raised in this kind of media context, you're going to look at it like you're looking at another culture and be like, what is wrong with these people that they got to the point where this is something that needs to be engaged with seriously at all?
[00:57:49.210 --> 00:57:57.512]  If you're going to make the argument, which is not at all unreasonable, that when it comes to climate, you should listen to people who are educated, informed scientists, so on and so forth.
[00:57:57.592 --> 00:57:59.672]  I can wrap my head around that very easily.
[00:57:59.972 --> 00:58:00.632]  But some kid?
[00:58:00.972 --> 00:58:04.433]  The only reason why someone like that is going to be leveraged
[00:58:04.953 --> 00:58:10.477]  Is because most of us have the decency not to argue back with a child.
[00:58:10.857 --> 00:58:15.740]  And that is what I think Americans don't appreciate about how malevolent their enemies are.
[00:58:16.141 --> 00:58:22.485]  They have no shame when it comes to doing things such as exploiting children to further their political purposes.
[00:58:22.765 --> 00:58:23.766]  And we saw the opposite!
[00:58:24.346 --> 00:58:28.648]  Everyone listening to this show knows to be respectful to older people.
[00:58:28.908 --> 00:58:35.310]  You see someone who's older, you call them sir, ma'am, you know, you assume that they're a good person, you hold the door for them.
[00:58:35.350 --> 00:58:37.151]  This is something that's one-on-one type stuff.
[00:58:37.651 --> 00:58:46.635]  At the same time COVID hits, now instead of, they're not saying, oh, you want obese people to die, which the comorbidity with morbid obesity and COVID is very high.
[00:58:46.915 --> 00:58:52.677]  They specifically say, oh, you want grandma to die because they know for most of, for all of us,
[00:58:53.177 --> 00:58:59.981]  The idea that you're going to harm an innocent elderly woman is something so unconscionable that you want to recoil in the opposite direction.
[00:59:00.241 --> 00:59:08.766]  It's the same tactic that they used in 2016 unsuccessfully when they were calling Trump and Trump supporters racists because people don't want to be racist.
[00:59:08.786 --> 00:59:09.687]  They recoil from that.
[00:59:10.047 --> 00:59:10.547]  Same thing here.
[00:59:10.568 --> 00:59:12.969]  It's like no one wants to say, I'm against the elderly.
[00:59:13.289 --> 00:59:14.050]  I hate the elderly.
[00:59:14.070 --> 00:59:14.850]  I want harm on them.
[00:59:15.170 --> 00:59:20.273]  So by using these techniques, it's a very effective means of controlling the population.
[00:59:20.413 --> 00:59:20.974]  They're shields!
[00:59:21.414 --> 00:59:23.355]  They're human shields, yes.
[00:59:24.056 --> 00:59:33.022]  And this is something I think people really need to wake up and focus less on what they are saying than the tactics that they use to further their BS.
[00:59:39.711 --> 00:59:40.032]  I don't
[01:00:02.555 --> 01:00:03.396]  Let me interrupt you.
[01:00:03.416 --> 01:00:06.420]  They're tripping over themselves to show how much they support this movement.
[01:00:06.460 --> 01:00:08.243]  It's not some conspiracy or anything.
[01:00:08.523 --> 01:00:09.384]  They're front and center.
[01:00:09.645 --> 01:00:11.067]  And if you don't have it, you're fired.
[01:00:11.547 --> 01:00:13.410]  And so isn't that what you're talking about?
[01:00:13.570 --> 01:00:15.232]  That corporate media
[01:00:16.503 --> 01:00:21.890]  And the corporations themselves are hiring all these black spokespersons for almost every product.
[01:00:21.910 --> 01:00:22.551]  And I'm great.
[01:00:22.591 --> 01:00:24.673]  Give black folks jobs, you know, in TV and radio.
[01:00:24.693 --> 01:00:25.134]  They're wonderful.
[01:00:25.154 --> 01:00:31.982]  My point is, when almost every ad is a black person and defense contractors are using a black face, they literally are saying, hey,
[01:00:32.583 --> 01:00:33.464]  We're black folks.
[01:00:33.564 --> 01:00:34.345]  Don't disagree with us.
[01:00:34.385 --> 01:00:35.106]  You're racist.
[01:00:35.166 --> 01:00:37.109]  It's very simple psychology.
[01:00:37.129 --> 01:00:40.533]  And then I hear some of these big black podcasters going, it's a black planet.
[01:00:40.773 --> 01:00:41.494]  We've taken over.
[01:00:41.594 --> 01:00:42.736]  Everything's us in the media.
[01:00:43.016 --> 01:00:44.117]  You know, we're in control now.
[01:00:44.218 --> 01:00:50.025]  No, they're starving Africans to death with the lockdown that's ongoing in Africa and other places like India.
[01:00:50.786 --> 01:00:51.807]  This is exploitive.
[01:00:52.328 --> 01:00:59.258]  These are corporations that run slave camps in China, like Apple, but it's okay because Tim Cook gave $100 million to Black Lives Matter.
[01:00:59.298 --> 01:01:07.309]  It's almost like a Catholic indulgence or something, where you pay the Pope to get your family out of hell or out of purgatory, and it's so transparent.
[01:01:07.729 --> 01:01:16.336]  I remember I was in a deli in New York and I was buying gum and Trident had a picture of just like a black girl on it, on the pack of gum.
[01:01:16.356 --> 01:01:20.980]  And it's like, wait a minute, I'm supposed to be against racism and I'm supposed to care about this, which is true.
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:25.243]  So I'm going to buy gum that has a picture of a black lady on it for no reason?
[01:01:25.504 --> 01:01:26.805]  It's a complete non sequitur.
[01:01:26.845 --> 01:01:27.505]  It's nonsensical.
[01:01:27.806 --> 01:01:30.548]  You just brought up something which I think is extremely crucial.
[01:01:31.048 --> 01:01:39.397]  One of the things, you always talk about the globalists, and what globalism means is this concept that by its nature, whether you for it or against it, that there's one size fits all.
[01:01:39.677 --> 01:01:43.521]  That the entire globe should basically be governed under the same set of rules.
[01:01:43.681 --> 01:01:46.645]  All groups must give up their culture to unify under this.
[01:01:46.665 --> 01:01:47.706]  Well, who writes the codes?
[01:01:47.766 --> 01:01:52.851]  It's like these leftists go, I want a big computer, like the Zeitgeist Movement, that alloticates the resources.
[01:01:52.871 --> 01:01:53.632]  Who programs it?
[01:01:53.752 --> 01:01:55.053]  But what was that country?
[01:01:55.113 --> 01:02:01.057]  There was a country in Africa, I'm sure you know what you're referring to, and I would love you to edify it, where they were trying to lock them down.
[01:02:01.097 --> 01:02:06.521]  They're saying, if we don't leave our houses and farm Nigeria, we're going to die.
[01:02:06.561 --> 01:02:08.222]  We don't have bank accounts.
[01:02:08.302 --> 01:02:09.823]  We are very, very poor.
[01:02:10.163 --> 01:02:13.025]  And if we don't go tend these crops, we're literally going to die.
[01:02:13.325 --> 01:02:17.528]  Starvation is a much bigger threat to us than any kind of illness.
[01:02:17.568 --> 01:02:17.868]  That's right.
[01:02:17.908 --> 01:02:21.851]  Nigeria, it's about 56% last time I saw of the household incomes on food.
[01:02:22.251 --> 01:02:23.612]  Most people have to grow food or they die.
[01:02:23.812 --> 01:02:38.642]  Yeah, so the thing is, even if you're going to assume the most benevolent motivations to people, that they're like, okay, we're trying to fight COVID, we have good motivations, when you have this kind of perspective that does not take individual circumstances into account,
[01:02:39.002 --> 01:02:56.276]  That individual is thrown into the garbage can, and what that ends up meaning in real terms is math's death and destruction, but they will never care because if they admit guilt and shame, that means you're not going to trust them the second time, and there goes a lot of the basis of their power and authority.
[01:02:56.496 --> 01:02:56.936]  Exactly.
[01:02:56.996 --> 01:03:00.219]  I mean, they all get together in a PR room and look at different PR pushes.
[01:03:00.899 --> 01:03:10.150]  You've got a meeting right now this weekend, last day up in Idaho, all the big head tech people, and they say, oh, we're talking about woke and fighting racism.
[01:03:10.350 --> 01:03:17.078]  And it's all a bunch of white dudes deciding how to go out and camouflage themselves as woke when they run some of those ruthless corporations on the planet.
[01:03:17.359 --> 01:03:18.961]  I mean, it's just, it's preposterous.
[01:03:19.491 --> 01:03:30.138]  But it's also the fact that people are trained since their kids in government schools and in entertainment media as well, how important these issues are.
[01:03:30.199 --> 01:03:31.840]  And I do think it's really important.
[01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:39.845]  I think it is, even still to this day, the history of American racism is poorly understood because it's not taught honestly and historically.
[01:03:39.945 --> 01:03:41.146]  Well, let's teach it honestly.
[01:03:41.226 --> 01:03:42.027]  I would call you a historian.
[01:03:42.047 --> 01:03:43.087]  You've written books on history.
[01:03:43.928 --> 01:03:45.028]  I mean, you know your histories.
[01:03:45.068 --> 01:03:45.969]  I've studied a lot of history.
[01:03:46.249 --> 01:03:46.689]  People don't get it.
[01:03:46.709 --> 01:03:47.449]  It's not like boring.
[01:03:47.509 --> 01:03:51.171]  You get addicted to it and all sorts of connecting different views on history.
[01:03:51.651 --> 01:03:59.654]  But I was brought up by parents that were kind of middle of the road politically, patriotic, but they were like, you know, slavery is bad and we've done bad things to people.
[01:04:00.014 --> 01:04:04.816]  So you need to not be guilty, but you need to be above things and be honorable and try to help everybody.
[01:04:05.176 --> 01:04:06.457]  And that's how my grandparents were.
[01:04:06.477 --> 01:04:09.118]  And I'm not going to get into whole stories about it or whatever, but I mean,
[01:04:10.198 --> 01:04:15.863]  My dad's mom would literally go deliver food to old black ladies in the town and take them to the hospital and stuff.
[01:04:15.903 --> 01:04:19.666]  And it wasn't some act to be a virgin signaler.
[01:04:19.966 --> 01:04:20.566]  This is what you did.
[01:04:20.586 --> 01:04:23.068]  She also went and helped some of the old, old, old white women in the area.
[01:04:23.088 --> 01:04:24.329]  That's just what you did in those communities.
[01:04:24.569 --> 01:04:25.530]  It was mainly black people.
[01:04:25.730 --> 01:04:30.314]  And they would like on Christmas and stuff, bring pies to the house and everything else because they knew, you know, all the things that had gone on.
[01:04:30.354 --> 01:04:32.295]  And my grandfather was the tax assessor.
[01:04:32.696 --> 01:04:34.317]  All the poor people, they just didn't get a tax bill.
[01:04:34.777 --> 01:04:47.709]  So it was stuff like that, but sitting there watching that and then I get to hear how I'm a racist and I'm inherently bad when I was always brought up to literally be a good person that helps everybody, that stands up for who the person is that Martin Luther King talked about.
[01:04:47.949 --> 01:04:52.734]  People, Martin Luther King didn't invent, judge somebody off the character and off their deeds and what they stand for.
[01:04:52.974 --> 01:04:53.575]  We all know that.
[01:04:53.615 --> 01:04:55.076]  We go to a restaurant because it has good food.
[01:04:55.256 --> 01:04:56.097]  Don't care what color you are.
[01:04:56.317 --> 01:04:59.798]  You buy a car, not because of the name, but because you've driven it, you like it.
[01:05:00.778 --> 01:05:03.979]  You wear clothes, at least I do, because I like how they fit, not because of the name.
[01:05:04.339 --> 01:05:11.621]  But see, that's the difference between corporatism and individualism is, it's all BS over reality, is basically what I'm saying.
[01:05:11.681 --> 01:05:19.504]  And so, what about the backlash, too, of not being, quote, tribalist or racist, really wanting to empower everybody, but being told, because I'm white, I'm bad.
[01:05:19.804 --> 01:05:20.504]  That's the elite.
[01:05:21.064 --> 01:05:35.292]  Camouflaging themselves in wokeness, but also knowing it's going to create a white backlash, and whites I've known that have not been racist are starting to become resentful of black people because the New World Order is using black people as their cover, and black folks better figure that out because it's dangerous.
[01:05:36.633 --> 01:05:47.622]  I am opposed to any of that and one thing I was just talking about earlier in terms of what happens is a lot of people on the right have given up entire areas, I'm sorry, entire areas of culture to left wing.
[01:05:47.682 --> 01:05:50.365]  They're going to say there's an earpiece in your ear or something and you're sorry.
[01:05:50.565 --> 01:05:51.846]  I'm just saying there's the camera, that's all.
[01:05:51.866 --> 01:05:52.326]  No, no, no.
[01:05:52.627 --> 01:05:54.108]  I'm getting my talking points from the KGB.
[01:05:55.909 --> 01:06:01.155]  A lot of people on the right have ceded entire schools of thought to leftism, especially at a university level.
[01:06:01.195 --> 01:06:02.056]  Let me give you... That's key!
[01:06:02.076 --> 01:06:02.717]  I'm going to shut up.
[01:06:03.278 --> 01:06:04.699]  We just act like they're God.
[01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:07.523]  Whatever lexicon or map they give us of the mind, we just follow that.
[01:06:07.583 --> 01:06:07.783]  No!
[01:06:08.043 --> 01:06:09.225]  Create your own maps, folks.
[01:06:09.245 --> 01:06:10.046]  Go with common sense.
[01:06:11.246 --> 01:06:20.169]  You do not have to have any kind of political persuasion whatsoever to ask yourself, what would it have been like to be an African-American person in New York in 1790?
[01:06:20.449 --> 01:06:22.469]  This is something that is of interest to anyone.
[01:06:22.509 --> 01:06:23.650]  Are they going to be treated the same?
[01:06:23.690 --> 01:06:24.910]  How bad are they going to be treated?
[01:06:25.210 --> 01:06:36.333]  However, because people have bought into the idea that gay history or feminist history or black history are inherently a left-wing or Democrat issue, they recoil
[01:06:36.753 --> 01:06:39.937]  And then those people get to be the ones to write the history.
[01:06:39.997 --> 01:06:50.068]  When in truth, no one's endorsed the institution of slavery, but it was incredible how many blacks had slaves and how there were free men and not, and how most of the Europeans that came here were indentured servant slaves themselves.
[01:06:50.509 --> 01:06:51.430]  No one knows that stuff.
[01:06:51.790 --> 01:06:53.551]  But here's something that's even more recent.
[01:06:53.691 --> 01:06:56.473]  They use a technique called Factual, Not Truthful.
[01:06:56.793 --> 01:07:00.556]  Let's suppose you and I were both, I don't know, whatever, huge income tax cheats.
[01:07:00.936 --> 01:07:03.458]  And someone keeps talking about Alex Jones, Alex Jones, Alex Jones.
[01:07:03.838 --> 01:07:05.119]  It was an income tax cheat.
[01:07:05.299 --> 01:07:06.880]  The implication is that I'm innocent.
[01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:09.101]  I'm not innocent, but you're focusing on Alex Jones.
[01:07:09.121 --> 01:07:15.285]  And what you see here is there's a lot of focus on the South and Southern racism, both during the slavery period and the Reconstruction.
[01:07:15.565 --> 01:07:18.347]  But they pretend that the North were these kind of enlightened.
[01:07:19.548 --> 01:07:23.831]  I mean, I love northerners, but I never heard people call black people n-words till I went up north.
[01:07:24.151 --> 01:07:25.912]  And I thought, is this a test to see if I'm racist?
[01:07:26.232 --> 01:07:29.554]  I never heard the n-word till I got around northerners and it's some racist ass stuff.
[01:07:29.674 --> 01:07:32.476]  But it's also if you go back and... So what is that then?
[01:07:33.176 --> 01:07:33.656]  What is what?
[01:07:34.277 --> 01:07:36.458]  Have you experienced in the north a lot of race type stuff?
[01:07:36.858 --> 01:07:37.078]  No.
[01:07:37.479 --> 01:07:39.942]  I mean, but my point is back in the... I'm talking about history.
[01:07:39.962 --> 01:07:42.886]  No, I'm saying I never even heard the N-word until I was in like New York and stuff.
[01:07:42.926 --> 01:07:44.788]  Well, I mean, I'm from Brooklyn.
[01:07:44.809 --> 01:07:46.951]  This is not something that is a thing.
[01:07:46.971 --> 01:07:47.632]  You know what I mean?
[01:07:48.353 --> 01:07:49.755]  But if you look at... Back to your thoughts.
[01:07:49.795 --> 01:07:50.556]  I'm going to shut up.
[01:07:50.616 --> 01:07:51.157]  No, that's a lie.
[01:07:51.477 --> 01:07:52.679]  If you look at back in the day...
[01:07:53.780 --> 01:08:04.808]  If you look at like the Harlem Renaissance, which was this great period in the 1920s where there was this kind of revolution in terms of black artistry, Langston Hughes, who's one of the great American poets of all time, he would talk about he was a student at Columbia.
[01:08:04.868 --> 01:08:05.408]  Columbia!
[01:08:05.829 --> 01:08:06.870]  And he couldn't get a job.
[01:08:07.330 --> 01:08:15.456]  So, but this is the kind of stuff that because people on the right refuse to look at American history and let their opponents write for them,
[01:08:15.836 --> 01:08:20.158]  Then they're reacting to a caricature of what ended up really happening.
[01:08:20.438 --> 01:08:30.302]  And this is a huge disservice and I would encourage anyone, because I'm positive a lot of your viewers are huge history buffs, stop taking the New York Times version of history at face value.
[01:08:30.322 --> 01:08:36.105]  Well give us a few gems then of alternate history versus leftist bizarro history.
[01:08:36.445 --> 01:08:38.026]  Well, I mean, this is one great example.
[01:08:38.086 --> 01:08:41.228]  The claim that the South was uniquely racist in American culture.
[01:08:41.248 --> 01:08:42.448]  Let's look at the abolition period.
[01:08:42.528 --> 01:08:47.571]  One of my great heroes, William Lloyd Garrison, I have his signed autograph hanging above my desk in my office.
[01:08:47.971 --> 01:08:52.794]  He was advocating for abolition today and full rights for black Americans today.
[01:08:53.134 --> 01:08:55.195]  He was almost lynched in Boston.
[01:08:55.515 --> 01:08:58.719]  You could still see the place where they almost got him.
[01:08:58.959 --> 01:08:59.480]  This is in the 1840s.
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:01.682]  This is the 1850s, I believe.
[01:09:02.062 --> 01:09:09.230]  But this is the kind of thing that is kind of swept under the rug because it doesn't fit the narrative that the north of the good guys and the south of bad guys.
[01:09:09.531 --> 01:09:10.432]  They were both bad guys.
[01:09:11.733 --> 01:09:12.094]  We're good to go.
[01:09:29.232 --> 01:09:37.198]  What sundown towns were was you could not be there as a black person when the sun went down, or they would forcibly kick you out of that town.
[01:09:37.498 --> 01:09:38.238]  That's horrible.
[01:09:38.539 --> 01:09:43.842]  But we're taught, Illinois, Abe Lincoln's from there, they're the good guys, and the South are the bad guys.
[01:09:44.142 --> 01:09:51.928]  Since this doesn't fit that cookie-cutter story, this is the kind of thing that none of us... But now in 2021 we're taught none of us can be out at sundown with the lockdowns.
[01:09:52.729 --> 01:09:54.230]  You're just making us all slaves!
[01:09:54.290 --> 01:09:57.052]  Sunrise to sunset, yeah, we have to be trapped in our homes.
[01:09:57.292 --> 01:10:12.865]  This is just one of the examples where I think it is, there's a lack, maybe it's part of the psychology, I don't know, and I'm not trying to offend people, just take a step back and don't emotionally react to this, there's a lack in some sense of intellectual curiosity among a lot of people on the right.
[01:10:15.547 --> 01:10:19.610]  And it's doing a huge disservice because the 1619 Project is another great example in the New York Times.
[01:10:19.931 --> 01:10:27.937]  When you let your ideological foes rewrite history and your only reaction is, well screw you, I'm going to do the opposite, you're playing on their terms.
[01:10:28.117 --> 01:10:39.586]  And you notice the left got so upset when Trump put out that report by a bunch of professors, a lot of them black, great professors, about being proud of America and how it was a trailblazer in the world and how he had helped other countries stop the bad things they were doing.
[01:10:39.906 --> 01:10:40.707]  They got so upset.
[01:10:40.727 --> 01:10:42.128]  Look, it's plagiarized.
[01:10:42.668 --> 01:10:47.213]  By different professors, but then there were professors whose names were on it who contributed.
[01:10:48.415 --> 01:10:53.000]  Again, they tried to call it plagiarized because the people's names on it had contributed from other reports.
[01:10:53.301 --> 01:10:55.623]  That's not plagiarized when it's their work put in the report.
[01:10:55.884 --> 01:11:00.209]  Yeah, there's just so much misinformation, or it's not even misinformation.
[01:11:00.589 --> 01:11:06.911]  It's selective information designed to further a narrative, but that's at the expense of the whole picture.
[01:11:07.131 --> 01:11:10.772]  So we're hearing things out of two sides of the mouth in terms of corporate media.
[01:11:11.072 --> 01:11:16.594]  You hear that the history of American racism is complex, nuanced, something that bears a lot of discussion.
[01:11:16.934 --> 01:11:17.234]  True.
[01:11:17.614 --> 01:11:20.615]  But at the same time, what they present the narrative is not complex at all.
[01:11:20.675 --> 01:11:21.375]  It's straightforward.
[01:11:21.615 --> 01:11:22.535]  These are the bad guys.
[01:11:22.796 --> 01:11:23.556]  These are the good guys.
[01:11:23.616 --> 01:11:24.436]  Which one are you going to be?
[01:11:24.676 --> 01:11:27.097]  Well, you know, it's not a hard choice between bad and good.
[01:11:27.810 --> 01:11:30.211]  Well that's right, they dumbed down the information.
[01:11:30.231 --> 01:11:32.652]  And so the medium is the message.
[01:11:32.772 --> 01:11:37.514]  Yeah, and this does an enormous disservice to racial relationships in America.
[01:11:37.894 --> 01:11:47.957]  It does enormous disservice to people who have a proud history to tell them that you should regard yourself as a victim, whereas a lot of times the people that they came from were the ones who were heroic and the ones we should all admire.
[01:11:48.297 --> 01:11:50.378]  Well exactly, and let's expand on that.
[01:11:53.166 --> 01:11:58.871]  at this one-size-fits-all thing for America, but if you look at how slavery is going on in at least 10 countries right now.
[01:11:58.891 --> 01:11:59.292]  Is that right?
[01:11:59.652 --> 01:12:00.313]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:12:00.353 --> 01:12:04.156]  There's still slavery in some of the Middle Eastern countries, there's slavery in Africa going on, yeah.
[01:12:05.157 --> 01:12:09.361]  And all that's happening, and you've got slavery, I call it slavery in China under communism.
[01:12:09.381 --> 01:12:10.402]  Of course that's slavery, yes.
[01:12:10.822 --> 01:12:13.925]  So my issue is, talking about America's issues,
[01:12:14.986 --> 01:12:15.446]  We're good to go.
[01:12:38.524 --> 01:12:40.845]  Or my great-great-granddaddy was a child molester, hypothetically.
[01:12:40.945 --> 01:12:41.585]  I'm not to blame.
[01:12:41.945 --> 01:12:47.307]  This authoritarian idea of sins of the forefathers is so bizarre.
[01:12:47.567 --> 01:12:50.148]  I mean, who even knows what their great-great-great-great-grandfather did?
[01:12:50.408 --> 01:12:51.329]  How are they going to say?
[01:12:51.789 --> 01:12:54.470]  More than half of the Europeans came here after the Civil War.
[01:12:55.270 --> 01:12:57.051]  Only, what, 2% of people in the U.S.
[01:12:57.091 --> 01:12:59.332]  had slaves during the Civil War or before it.
[01:12:59.632 --> 01:13:05.634]  So the idea that we all have this sin, when almost no white people here have any connection to it,
[01:13:05.914 --> 01:13:06.874]  It's just preposterous.
[01:13:07.054 --> 01:13:15.896]  Well, also the idea, again, this is something no historian is going to disagree with, Lincoln said repeatedly and explicitly... If I could unify the Union without freeing one black slave, I'd do it.
[01:13:16.036 --> 01:13:35.040]  Yeah, so, and the claim that anyone in 1860, with exceptions like William Lloyd Garrison and other, who at the time, complete fringe figures, did not have an element of racism to it, is completely untrue, and that's something that I think people who study history all agree on, and it's something that bears this... Sure, and what about how it was Christians
[01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:36.621]  That led the fight.
[01:13:36.981 --> 01:13:38.842]  England really banned slavery in most of the world.
[01:13:39.202 --> 01:13:40.823]  England went to war with dozens of countries.
[01:13:41.103 --> 01:13:44.646]  Hundreds of thousands died in some cases per war to end slavery.
[01:13:44.666 --> 01:13:45.706]  And that was Christians.
[01:13:46.126 --> 01:13:47.587]  That was kind of like Cromwell Part 2.
[01:13:47.928 --> 01:13:50.249]  Taking over and demanding it gunpointed in.
[01:13:50.509 --> 01:13:53.951]  So how, if white people ended slavery in most areas of the world, how are we to blame?
[01:13:53.971 --> 01:13:54.492]  That's all I'm saying.
[01:13:54.632 --> 01:13:58.274]  And the other thing that's swept in... Because if sins are passed on, aren't good deeds passed on?
[01:13:58.294 --> 01:13:59.435]  Actually, I don't think they really are.
[01:14:00.155 --> 01:14:07.000]  But the other thing that's swept under the rug is you have the story of the Civil War, which is, you know, kind of painted in a very simplistic terms as the victory of good over evil.
[01:14:07.340 --> 01:14:18.028]  But then you talk about Reconstruction, where all these supposed good guys did not give a crap about the formerly free slaves, that they were, you know, being completely exploited and terrorized by the southern governments.
[01:14:18.068 --> 01:14:24.393]  But since you have the narrative of now the North abandoned them and didn't care, and they never cared about them to begin with,
[01:14:24.713 --> 01:14:29.696]  That somehow doesn't fit into that cookie-cutter Disney version, and that's something that else is ignored.
[01:14:30.216 --> 01:14:32.438]  I think that's an enormous... Well, I'll tell you what's accurate.
[01:14:32.458 --> 01:14:39.081]  I mean, it's stylized like a play, but Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York from Reading History, that's pretty accurate.
[01:14:39.121 --> 01:14:40.822]  I mean, every group hated every other group.
[01:14:40.842 --> 01:14:41.303]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:14:41.323 --> 01:14:41.763]  It was very tribal.
[01:14:42.103 --> 01:14:43.324]  Oh, enormously so.
[01:14:44.165 --> 01:14:46.288]  That's one of the other beauties of having free markets.
[01:14:46.368 --> 01:14:51.012]  When people are wealthier, they have an opportunity to be kinder, more benevolent.
[01:14:51.893 --> 01:14:56.919]  If I have to choose between you and my family when it comes to food, sorry Alex, I like you, it's not going to be a choice.
[01:14:57.199 --> 01:14:59.001]  But if we both have enough food on our plate,
[01:14:59.341 --> 01:15:00.642]  Hell, take as much as you want.
[01:15:18.601 --> 01:15:20.443]  Well, it's also just basic humanity.
[01:15:20.463 --> 01:15:23.765]  If you go back 100 years ago, we didn't have air conditioning.
[01:15:23.966 --> 01:15:28.670]  People are sleeping on their roofs, they're sleeping in public parks, and now this is something that we all take for given.
[01:15:29.130 --> 01:15:32.733]  When my dad would go visit his grandparents in the town next to him, he lived in the country.
[01:15:32.933 --> 01:15:33.834]  What state was this in?
[01:15:33.854 --> 01:15:34.475]  This was in Texas.
[01:15:34.955 --> 01:15:37.917]  This is, we've been here since, on that side of the family since the 1820s on both sides.
[01:15:38.758 --> 01:15:42.621]  We get into lineage and stuff, which I don't take credit for that, but I'm like founders of Texas on both sides.
[01:15:43.422 --> 01:15:45.824]  Colonel Travis Holland, nobody's even related to those people, but I am.
[01:15:46.344 --> 01:15:50.968]  The thing is, is that they would, my dad would go sleep on his grandfather's roof in Texas.
[01:15:50.988 --> 01:15:52.369]  That's what you did for air conditioning.
[01:15:52.509 --> 01:15:57.630]  Yeah, and that's also going to lead to crime and mugging because you're sleeping, you're outside and all sorts of assaults.
[01:15:57.970 --> 01:16:03.212]  But this is something we all take for granted that now even the poorest people have access to air conditioning and having kind of that.
[01:16:03.432 --> 01:16:06.692]  Can you imagine how miserable it is to be 24-7 and never to have, like, cool?
[01:16:06.712 --> 01:16:08.573]  And you don't have access to running water or a shower.
[01:16:08.933 --> 01:16:14.334]  So we take for granted how much better things have gotten for even the poorest of the poor in America.
[01:16:14.674 --> 01:16:21.156]  And when you do have that wealth, it's much easier to be helpful and more benevolent to others because it doesn't cost you anything.
[01:16:21.536 --> 01:16:31.123]  Well, when I read the WikiLeaks, you can pull these up, Hillary's talking to, I don't want to say it's a Columbia psychology professor, but she says, what do we do?
[01:16:31.143 --> 01:16:33.225]  And he said, we accelerate culture war.
[01:16:33.645 --> 01:16:34.866]  It's all we can do is divide them.
[01:16:35.146 --> 01:16:36.827]  So it's right there, they're dividing and conquering.
[01:16:36.847 --> 01:16:39.029]  So how do you counter something that cynical?
[01:16:39.429 --> 01:16:47.755]  Well, first of all, you have to acknowledge it for what it is, that these people have no shame and they have no compunctions about doing whatever is necessary to maintain their hold on power.
[01:16:48.935 --> 01:16:49.976]  2020 is a great example.
[01:16:50.356 --> 01:16:59.383]  Let's suppose for the sake of argument, and this is not a hard argument to make, you needed to destroy all these businesses in order to otherwise billions of people are going to die.
[01:16:59.623 --> 01:16:59.843]  Fine.
[01:17:00.243 --> 01:17:06.066]  You would think, when it was all said and done, you'd be like, man, this was terrible that all these businesses were destroyed.
[01:17:06.366 --> 01:17:08.367]  What of our horrible price we paid for this?
[01:17:08.727 --> 01:17:09.447]  There's none of that.
[01:17:09.707 --> 01:17:12.749]  There's no hand-wringing about what have we done, what were the costs.
[01:17:12.809 --> 01:17:14.089]  It was like, we did what had to be done.
[01:17:14.409 --> 01:17:16.330]  If you're out of business, too bad.
[01:17:16.851 --> 01:17:22.773]  And then you see the motivation really isn't helping people so much as maintaining power and control and getting their gender.
[01:17:24.554 --> 01:17:28.995]  When I did your show that just premiered a few days ago, it was great.
[01:17:29.015 --> 01:17:30.096]  You rapid-fired questions.
[01:17:30.116 --> 01:17:30.776]  You were very prepared.
[01:17:30.856 --> 01:17:31.176]  I'm not.
[01:17:31.196 --> 01:17:32.857]  I mean, I actually have hundreds of questions I could ask.
[01:17:32.877 --> 01:17:33.557]  You're not prepared?
[01:17:33.577 --> 01:17:35.317]  You've got phone books in front of you.
[01:17:35.357 --> 01:17:36.478]  Well, this is from the show yesterday.
[01:17:36.558 --> 01:17:43.440]  But seriously, I agree with you that we're winning and that there's an awakening happening and these power grabs are a sign of desperation.
[01:17:45.036 --> 01:17:46.377]  But let's elaborate on that.
[01:17:47.157 --> 01:17:47.397]  Sure.
[01:17:47.898 --> 01:18:01.665]  I think that if you had your druthers, right, if you could tell someone, hey, if you do this, you know, you do what I want, you just persuade them, that's going to be cheap, doesn't take me much expense, I just tell you two sentences and I get what I want.
[01:18:02.165 --> 01:18:18.373]  If I have to persuade you, if I have to force you, that is more expensive in terms of my emotions, more expensive in terms of my time, and at a certain point you, the target, are going to resent it because instead of doing what I believe I've been persuaded to do, now I'm being strong-armed into it.
[01:18:18.673 --> 01:18:25.536]  And it is, you know, like if someone has a dog that's disobedient, at a certain point you're like, I love this dog, I can't deal with it anymore because it's just driving me crazy.
[01:18:26.016 --> 01:18:40.263]  That quiet defiance, which all of us are in a position to impose and to make it expensive for them, that I think drives them crazy because it also takes away their veneer of what Thomas Sowell called the vision of the anointed.
[01:18:40.583 --> 01:18:41.644]  That's a great book.
[01:18:41.884 --> 01:18:43.005]  It's a superb book.
[01:18:43.405 --> 01:18:44.986]  I read that book like 25 years ago.
[01:18:45.186 --> 01:18:52.289]  Yeah, he talks to the idea, which especially in like over-educated urban elites, that they genuinely feel and they were taught this.
[01:18:52.329 --> 01:18:53.230]  They take their saviors.
[01:18:53.650 --> 01:18:55.411]  They were taught this since the 1890s.
[01:18:55.712 --> 01:18:59.494]  Woodrow Wilson's vision was something called the Social Gospel.
[01:18:59.815 --> 01:19:03.697]  And what that meant, it's supposedly Christian, but I'm not a Christian, it seems to be the opposite.
[01:19:03.717 --> 01:19:06.960]  But it's more a white man's burden, but it's not...
[01:19:08.005 --> 01:19:08.665]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:19:08.945 --> 01:19:13.327]  My point is, the idea which is, I think in terms of regular Christianity is downright satanic.
[01:19:13.707 --> 01:19:16.768]  Instead of an individual having a soul, a nation has a soul.
[01:19:17.128 --> 01:19:21.170]  And you have to save that nation from falling into sin.
[01:19:21.430 --> 01:19:25.491]  Well, if your entire nation has a soul, what is going to be outside your dominion?
[01:19:25.831 --> 01:19:26.211]  Nothing.
[01:19:26.472 --> 01:19:27.973]  You're going to be involved in the boardroom.
[01:19:28.233 --> 01:19:29.494]  That is totally collectivist.
[01:19:29.654 --> 01:19:30.814]  It's totally collectivist.
[01:19:31.055 --> 01:19:32.195]  It's totally not Christian.
[01:19:32.516 --> 01:19:33.716]  And it's totally deranged.
[01:19:33.936 --> 01:19:42.462]  But you see that in this day where every nobody feels empowered to impose their view on those who are thinking or acting correctly.
[01:19:42.522 --> 01:19:42.922]  Exactly.
[01:19:42.943 --> 01:19:44.884]  Like you said, it's whatever the Democrats say.
[01:19:44.904 --> 01:19:47.826]  We just we then debate that instead of creating.
[01:19:48.226 --> 01:19:53.990]  Earlier you were saying the Democrats history wise, the left, they are the ones that are creating the main
[01:19:55.911 --> 01:19:56.252]  We're good.
[01:20:15.734 --> 01:20:16.495]  No, no, grab it.
[01:20:16.535 --> 01:20:17.315]  We're bringing it in here.
[01:20:17.335 --> 01:20:19.997]  Will somebody grab that off the wall in the green room, please?
[01:20:20.017 --> 01:20:21.619]  1965 mayoral campaign, which was kind of a stunt.
[01:20:21.659 --> 01:20:23.680]  When Buckley was asked, what would you do if you won?
[01:20:23.980 --> 01:20:24.981]  He said, ask for a recount.
[01:20:25.041 --> 01:20:26.943]  So he was kind of clever in his own way.
[01:20:27.403 --> 01:20:35.029]  I thought he was a very nefarious influence on the right, because he regarded himself as kind of that gatekeeper and anyone too... Yeah, he was definitely CIA.
[01:20:35.329 --> 01:20:36.891]  Okay, so yeah, that's true.
[01:20:36.971 --> 01:20:37.771]  Can you talk about that?
[01:20:37.911 --> 01:20:41.074]  Let me tell you how this stuff happens around here.
[01:20:41.114 --> 01:20:41.634]  Yeah, there it is.
[01:20:41.854 --> 01:20:43.596]  About half the things on the walls
[01:20:45.953 --> 01:20:46.874]  We're mailed to us.
[01:20:47.054 --> 01:20:47.374]  Okay.
[01:20:48.175 --> 01:20:49.256]  And this was mailed to me.
[01:20:49.496 --> 01:20:49.756]  Okay.
[01:20:50.117 --> 01:20:51.738]  And I thought it was interesting and I stuck it up.
[01:20:51.818 --> 01:20:52.499]  It is interesting.
[01:20:52.539 --> 01:20:53.900]  It's the most certainly it says great.
[01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:57.182]  And guys go back in the hallway, the hallway right there.
[01:20:57.583 --> 01:21:00.645]  There's a Bible verse a listener sent to that's hanging up, which I do agree with.
[01:21:00.926 --> 01:21:02.427]  So just grab the Bible verse off the wall right there.
[01:21:02.627 --> 01:21:03.228]  Here, here, here, here.
[01:21:03.248 --> 01:21:04.028]  Let's keep talking.
[01:21:04.048 --> 01:21:04.248]  Go ahead.
[01:21:04.268 --> 01:21:04.489]  Yeah.
[01:21:04.529 --> 01:21:08.532]  Well, I want to know why, why, what that means to you and why it's hanging and so on and so forth.
[01:21:11.553 --> 01:21:13.314]  Like, are you a fan of Buckley?
[01:21:13.454 --> 01:21:14.735]  What do you think of Natural Review?
[01:21:14.755 --> 01:21:16.456]  No, I've made fun of him quite a bit.
[01:21:16.536 --> 01:21:19.737]  Okay, so what do you view as the role of Buckley?
[01:21:19.757 --> 01:21:24.120]  What is your evaluation of William F. Buckley and his influence on... This I endorse!
[01:21:25.131 --> 01:21:26.291]  And Alistair sent us this too.
[01:21:26.531 --> 01:21:26.831]  Okay.
[01:21:27.312 --> 01:21:37.614]  If my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will have from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal the land.
[01:21:38.274 --> 01:21:41.675]  Yeah, and so more than half the stuff hanging in this office was mailed to me.
[01:21:41.855 --> 01:21:42.615]  Okay.
[01:21:42.695 --> 01:21:44.736]  There's some really great stuff.
[01:21:45.596 --> 01:21:49.777]  Charlie Sheen mailed me a Jackety War Inn
[01:21:51.380 --> 01:21:51.540]  Yeah.
[01:22:10.745 --> 01:22:10.985]  Yeah.
[01:22:40.865 --> 01:22:41.685]  Yeah, never.
[01:22:41.785 --> 01:22:42.866]  Against Trump was the headline.
[01:22:42.886 --> 01:22:43.586]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:22:43.706 --> 01:22:46.107]  And so, I mean, it's a piece of history.
[01:22:47.327 --> 01:22:48.368]  And so I hung it up on the wall.
[01:22:48.428 --> 01:22:50.048]  But there's no cryptic secret meaning.
[01:22:50.468 --> 01:22:53.129]  This, I endorse wholeheartedly.
[01:22:53.189 --> 01:22:56.050]  This is something, this was meltdust in the frame, by the way.
[01:22:56.130 --> 01:22:56.791]  Very nice gift.
[01:22:56.831 --> 01:22:58.791]  I forget who, we've had this for over 10 years.
[01:22:59.451 --> 01:23:00.812]  So that's where the William F. Buckley thing comes from.
[01:23:01.072 --> 01:23:02.153]  But I think it's a very good question.
[01:23:02.373 --> 01:23:06.195]  But what do you think about, like, National Review just historically and today?
[01:23:06.215 --> 01:23:08.217]  Do you think that they had done more harm than good?
[01:23:08.237 --> 01:23:09.818]  Do you think they're just globalists?
[01:23:09.858 --> 01:23:11.079]  Like, what's your perspective on them?
[01:23:12.219 --> 01:23:16.482]  Undoubtedly, National Review has presided over the destruction of America.
[01:23:16.642 --> 01:23:17.803]  Oh, there's an answer.
[01:23:17.843 --> 01:23:18.264]  Okay, yeah.
[01:23:18.324 --> 01:23:20.565]  Yeah, and I think it's just full of terrible people.
[01:23:21.466 --> 01:23:23.247]  And I think William F. Buckley was a fop.
[01:23:23.267 --> 01:23:29.131]  I think he was a fraudulent intellectual who would sit there and
[01:23:31.380 --> 01:23:48.094]  Pontificate with fancy words you'd come up with strung together that half the time didn't even have any meaning and he would he would have equally fraudulent conversations with other leftist fops and then they would all you know snootily decide that they were the ruling class and so that's where I see William Buckley.
[01:23:48.474 --> 01:23:58.142]  Now you raised somebody who I thought was really good he loved the showgirls you know he owned his family was wealthy he was a business guy he already owned a bunch of malls and of course that was Barry Goldwater
[01:23:58.422 --> 01:23:58.722]  Oh yeah.
[01:24:20.462 --> 01:24:26.783]  So it was really funny because Barry Goldwater, for people who are on the right who don't know him, he might be one of the most interesting characters.
[01:24:26.823 --> 01:24:29.844]  Running ads were, you're gonna get nuked if you vote for Goldwater.
[01:24:30.204 --> 01:24:37.065]  Well, they came out with a can of Goldwater as part of the campaign and he drank it once and he said, this tastes like piss.
[01:24:37.505 --> 01:24:42.146]  But his campaign was really when Reagan put his stamp on the map.
[01:24:42.206 --> 01:24:43.887]  I'm going to be talking about this in an upcoming book.
[01:24:43.947 --> 01:24:45.007]  I would encourage everyone
[01:24:45.347 --> 01:24:46.228]  Oh, so you're an expert on it.
[01:24:46.248 --> 01:24:46.688]  Tell us about it.
[01:24:46.708 --> 01:24:50.110]  Well, I'm not... I wouldn't say expert yet, but... Well, spend some time on it now!
[01:24:50.130 --> 01:24:57.114]  I'm trying, but somewhat crazy person keeps talking over me, despite promising otherwise, yesterday and in text and in writing.
[01:24:57.295 --> 01:24:58.475]  I didn't really... You loved yesterday.
[01:24:58.715 --> 01:24:59.576]  I did love yesterday.
[01:24:59.636 --> 01:25:00.236]  I'm here, ain't I?
[01:25:00.336 --> 01:25:01.357]  I'll interrupt more of you, Ashton.
[01:25:01.577 --> 01:25:01.997]  Okay.
[01:25:02.037 --> 01:25:02.278]  Go ahead.
[01:25:04.119 --> 01:25:16.686]  Everyone who's a patriot, everyone who's American, I'm not using the word patriot ironically, look up Reagan's speech from 1964 when he came out for Goldwater, even though Goldwater had no chance at that point of winning, and it was the biggest electoral landslide in history.
[01:25:17.067 --> 01:25:19.028]  His speech is called, A Time for Choosing.
[01:25:19.508 --> 01:25:29.336]  And there's this great paragraph in it, which resonates strongly with me and with many other people, where he talks about having two friends from Cuba, and one of them, they had escaped to the States.
[01:25:29.836 --> 01:25:31.618]  And, uh, sorry, Cuban and American.
[01:25:31.758 --> 01:25:36.922]  And the guy tells the Cuban, you know, you're so lucky you had America to escape to.
[01:25:37.322 --> 01:25:40.565]  And the Cuban says, yeah, but you guys have nowhere to go.
[01:25:40.945 --> 01:25:41.366]  I don't know.
[01:25:59.887 --> 01:26:00.608]  This country.
[01:26:00.988 --> 01:26:14.139]  And I think it's very useful for a lot of people, and I'm positive you would agree with me, they will exploit the concept of patriotism because people love America correctly in order to... So we better define what real patriotism is.
[01:26:14.559 --> 01:26:17.001]  In a limited sense, we're not going to go to zero government overnight.
[01:26:17.241 --> 01:26:19.123]  The communists have their plan, anarchists have theirs.
[01:26:19.583 --> 01:26:25.869]  I agree that with an upright, moral people, you know, maybe a hundred years from now, there will be no government and no corporation acting like government.
[01:26:25.929 --> 01:26:26.149]  Right.
[01:26:26.549 --> 01:26:28.611]  But how do we get to that?
[01:26:28.931 --> 01:26:30.952]  Nirvana and what do we do in the interim?
[01:26:31.213 --> 01:26:34.335]  What is the little government we use to guard us from other systems?
[01:26:34.395 --> 01:26:43.922]  Well, I think that certain things, the free speech principles, when you are trying to put forth a narrative that is in contradiction to reality,
[01:26:44.942 --> 01:26:47.706]  I can't say this about you, I'm not trying to make a joke.
[01:26:48.087 --> 01:26:55.576]  If the New York Times has a tweet, I can go on Twitter or anyone else can and say, this is misinformation, here's the receipts to the contrary.
[01:26:56.077 --> 01:27:00.383]  On these sites, you have equal footing with these Goliaths.
[01:27:00.723 --> 01:27:02.145]  That is why it is so important.
[01:27:02.165 --> 01:27:02.906]  And they can't stand that.
[01:27:03.086 --> 01:27:03.987]  They can't stand that.
[01:27:04.047 --> 01:27:06.629]  That's why you saw this with the lockdowns.
[01:27:06.649 --> 01:27:10.953]  They were being so heavy-handed with contradictory people just asking questions.
[01:27:11.213 --> 01:27:13.335]  And these are just me or you who aren't doctors.
[01:27:13.655 --> 01:27:15.637]  These are people who are nobodies.
[01:27:15.877 --> 01:27:17.338]  These are prominent doctors.
[01:27:17.658 --> 01:27:18.960]  This is how science works.
[01:27:19.260 --> 01:27:25.505]  When you have a pandemic, which you don't understand what's going on, there's only going to be limited information, limited data, and it's something that's dynamic and moving.
[01:27:25.805 --> 01:27:27.767]  You want the best minds that educate.
[01:27:27.807 --> 01:27:28.728]  You want open debate.
[01:27:29.048 --> 01:27:37.297]  The freedom and excellence and innovation is about debate, but they just go, science is not asking questions, you cannot question me, I am science.
[01:27:37.337 --> 01:27:42.943]  When Fauci said that, it was so archetypally fraudulent and in the face of science.
[01:27:43.123 --> 01:27:47.908]  Yeah, and now here's the other thing, let's talk about the lab leak.
[01:27:49.188 --> 01:27:52.709]  Let's say for the sake of argument, there's nothing to it.
[01:27:53.169 --> 01:27:59.631]  It is still of enormous importance for people to discuss, is there a possibility of viruses being man-made?
[01:28:00.571 --> 01:28:02.211]  Who has this capability?
[01:28:02.271 --> 01:28:04.252]  Should these labs be doing tests with things like this?
[01:28:04.292 --> 01:28:05.912]  Right, like what are the consequences?
[01:28:05.972 --> 01:28:10.353]  These are bioethical questions that concern us all, and this is one-on-one type stuff.
[01:28:10.553 --> 01:28:14.274]  We talk about nuclear weapons and is it a threat, nuclear weapon proliferation.
[01:28:14.594 --> 01:28:25.942]  But as soon as people start talking about the possibility of this being done by China of all places, which experiments on human beings, which has concentration camps, which oppresses everyone, that has to be put to an end.
[01:28:26.042 --> 01:28:28.884]  I don't think it's strictly a function of the Chinese government.
[01:28:29.144 --> 01:28:32.846]  I think it's a function of we are putting forth our corporate narrative.
[01:28:33.226 --> 01:28:36.329]  And if you are questioning it, that's going to make us look less certain.
[01:28:36.649 --> 01:28:39.070]  And if we're not certain, why are you listening to us?
[01:28:39.331 --> 01:28:44.354]  But if people stop listening to them, that's when they lose the enormous lion's share of their power.
[01:28:45.355 --> 01:28:45.975]  Well, that's right.
[01:28:46.896 --> 01:28:50.419]  Getting back to William F. Buckley, he came out of the Eastern Establishment that founded the CIA.
[01:28:50.479 --> 01:28:50.720]  Yeah.
[01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:53.962]  And it was really an anglophile British intelligence organization.
[01:28:54.323 --> 01:29:04.091]  And I don't say the British run America, but they handed the baton off as their empire fell at the end of World War II to us and then basically imprinted themselves on us.
[01:29:04.372 --> 01:29:05.833]  And I think William F. Buckley was a British agent.
[01:29:05.953 --> 01:29:13.221]  But it's also kind of interesting, his big book that made his name was called God and Man at Yale and him complaining about, you know, religion being taught at Yale.
[01:29:13.601 --> 01:29:21.530]  I think nowadays virtually all conservatives, or at least ones who kind of would, I would tend to agree with more, realize Yale is not salvageable.
[01:29:21.910 --> 01:29:26.716]  Like, I shouldn't be like, how are we going to make... By the way, I went to Yale a few months ago and
[01:29:28.601 --> 01:29:29.702]  They look like zombies.
[01:29:30.362 --> 01:29:31.442]  Don't care what color they were.
[01:29:31.462 --> 01:29:32.823]  It just looked like a joke.
[01:29:32.883 --> 01:29:35.724]  It looked like a mental institution had been let out or something.
[01:29:35.744 --> 01:29:39.206]  I spent a lot of time there and I was like, no one looked upright.
[01:29:39.226 --> 01:29:40.206]  No one looked strong.
[01:29:40.647 --> 01:29:43.068]  No one was, no one had any light in their eyes.
[01:29:43.348 --> 01:29:49.231]  They were just like a bunch of shuffling people around in, in, in jogging suits and stuff.
[01:29:49.291 --> 01:29:54.453]  And, and, and I, and I went into some of the classes and I went into some of the areas and it just, it looked like a tombstone.
[01:29:54.833 --> 01:29:55.374]  Of America.
[01:29:55.394 --> 01:29:56.716]  It didn't look like a powerful place.
[01:29:56.776 --> 01:29:57.257]  Wait, hold on.
[01:29:58.159 --> 01:29:59.821]  I think you're yadda yadda-ing the best part.
[01:30:00.162 --> 01:30:05.591]  What is the reaction of the Yale student body when Alex F. N. Jones is walking around campus?
[01:30:06.381 --> 01:30:11.666]  Uh, hissing and screaming and debating whether I'm allowed to be there, and then they call the police on me.
[01:30:11.746 --> 01:30:12.186]  Is that true?
[01:30:12.246 --> 01:30:13.667]  And they're still going, get out of here!
[01:30:13.707 --> 01:30:14.708]  I'm like, well he's allowed to.
[01:30:14.808 --> 01:30:15.108]  No!
[01:30:15.128 --> 01:30:18.151]  And so they were having like hundreds showed up within minutes.
[01:30:18.931 --> 01:30:20.032]  What brought you to Yale?
[01:30:21.253 --> 01:30:25.617]  I was already up there doing some research in the area and I thought, let's just go to Skull & Bones.
[01:30:25.897 --> 01:30:27.778]  And what was crazy is I showed up there on 322.
[01:30:29.022 --> 01:30:29.662]  What's 322?
[01:30:30.203 --> 01:30:35.426]  Well, 322 is the name of the chapter.
[01:30:35.526 --> 01:30:36.347]  March 22nd.
[01:30:36.587 --> 01:30:38.128]  So, that's the thing.
[01:30:38.248 --> 01:30:42.030]  Are you the kind of person who thinks Yale is something that can and should be fixed?
[01:30:42.310 --> 01:30:48.954]  Or do you regard it as basically an alien influence on this country that's been steering us in the wrong direction for over 100 years?
[01:30:49.295 --> 01:30:50.095]  I have my answer.
[01:30:50.255 --> 01:30:50.956]  People are entitled to it.
[01:30:50.976 --> 01:30:51.956]  Well, you know your history.
[01:30:52.076 --> 01:30:57.800]  So, Yale, since Skull & Bones got set up, is just a competing group of cults.
[01:30:59.130 --> 01:31:01.812]  And it's really a group of criminals around the country.
[01:31:01.872 --> 01:31:03.213]  I mean, I just think of Yale.
[01:31:03.233 --> 01:31:05.015]  I mean, what do you think?
[01:31:05.095 --> 01:31:09.678]  Well, no, I want to hear more about this because you know much more about this kind of like a secret society stuff than I do.
[01:31:09.758 --> 01:31:11.159]  Like, I mean, the Hellfire Clubs.
[01:31:11.219 --> 01:31:16.063]  Benjamin Franklin was a member of the Hellfire Clubs when he was in Jefferson.
[01:31:16.183 --> 01:31:16.523]  Oxford.
[01:31:16.824 --> 01:31:17.064]  Yeah.
[01:31:17.224 --> 01:31:19.326]  And you know, I was invited to the Hellfire Club.
[01:31:19.506 --> 01:31:20.406]  I did not know that.
[01:31:20.486 --> 01:31:21.267]  Please tell me more.
[01:31:21.627 --> 01:31:22.248]  They still around?
[01:31:23.732 --> 01:31:24.552]  Well, let me do this.
[01:31:24.952 --> 01:31:25.792]  Let me take a piss.
[01:31:26.372 --> 01:31:26.693]  Okay.
[01:31:26.733 --> 01:31:29.133]  Let's take a quick two-minute break, and I'll come back and tell you about the Hellfire Club.
[01:31:29.173 --> 01:31:29.673]  Yeah, please.
[01:31:29.953 --> 01:31:31.153]  Michael Malice is here!
[01:31:31.613 --> 01:31:32.094]  Stay with us.
[01:31:41.175 --> 01:31:51.017]  Britney Spears, and several other big names, were groomed to star in the new Mickey Mouse Club during a time the company was rife with pedophiles.
[01:31:51.832 --> 01:31:58.278]  Dozens of Disney employees have been arrested for child sex crimes, including top executives and directors.
[01:31:58.738 --> 01:32:06.725]  And in some cases, rehired by Disney to work with children after doing extremely short jail time for raping a child actor.
[01:32:07.425 --> 01:32:14.530]  Former Disney Chairman and Democrat Senator George Mitchell was identified as a pedophile who visited Epstein Island.
[01:32:15.190 --> 01:32:20.094]  And before that, Ghislaine Maxwell was doing photo ops for Disney's Save the Children.
[01:32:20.774 --> 01:32:25.658]  Several former child stars have claimed that the industry is crawling with pedophiles.
[01:32:26.258 --> 01:32:28.219]  We have already heard many of their stories.
[01:32:28.760 --> 01:32:33.303]  If we can look at the evidence and overcome our emotions, we can see what this is.
[01:32:35.410 --> 01:32:49.433]  Trauma-based mind control programs, such as MKUltra and Project Monarch, were revealed to the public via declassified documents in the 70s, and again in the 90s, with several victims giving testimony before Congress.
[01:32:49.993 --> 01:33:01.296]  The basis of these programs is the routine infliction of severe trauma upon a child, in order to force their mind into a dissociative state, allowing them to be controlled without awareness.
[01:33:02.128 --> 01:33:08.857]  Up until the age of seven, children live mostly in a hypnotic state of mind, when their sense of reality is being written.
[01:33:09.638 --> 01:33:14.404]  Which explains why they target children, specifically those that come from abusive households.
[01:33:15.717 --> 01:33:29.726]  Bryce Taylor and Kathy O'Brien have each described in their books how they were regularly brought to Disneyland and Disney World, where they would be tortured and raped while being programmed with Disney stories, as well as Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland.
[01:33:30.566 --> 01:33:32.868]  This has been verified in CIA documents.
[01:33:33.968 --> 01:33:42.814]  O'Brien says she was tortured in a room beneath Disney World, which we know was designed by agents of the CIA, who were running this program at that time.
[01:33:43.720 --> 01:33:47.542]  Victims of these programs were sold into them by their abusive parents.
[01:33:48.563 --> 01:33:53.366]  A model we see today with parents pimping their children out to the entertainment industry.
[01:33:54.406 --> 01:34:09.135]  Brittany's parents had her audition for Disney when she was 8 years old, where she was then brought into the industry, sent to New York City for training, and brought on the show 3 years later at age 11, where she was dressed and directed to perform like an adult.
[01:34:10.015 --> 01:34:19.400]  The art of mind control was known as far back as Plato's Allegory of the Cave, where people's belief systems were being created by illusions force-fed into their minds.
[01:34:20.140 --> 01:34:20.480]  Story.
[01:34:21.081 --> 01:34:24.022]  Our imagination has always been influenced by story.
[01:34:24.722 --> 01:34:29.525]  And if you can control the stories told to the public, you can control their imagination.
[01:34:30.365 --> 01:34:36.668]  Since the dawn of television, visual storytelling has been the most fundamental form of mind control in the modern world.
[01:34:37.389 --> 01:34:37.849]  Television.
[01:34:38.644 --> 01:34:39.004]  Movies.
[01:34:39.844 --> 01:34:40.284]  Videos.
[01:34:40.965 --> 01:34:45.866]  And since the beginning, we have been subjected to a long-term agenda of sexual subversion.
[01:34:46.566 --> 01:34:51.087]  As each generation is born, the stimuli becomes slightly more perverse.
[01:34:52.167 --> 01:35:02.730]  As the Mickey Mouse Club grew old, their young impressionable audience grew to perceive them as highly successful, while flaunting sexual promiscuity and sexual assault.
[01:35:03.720 --> 01:35:07.741]  You can destroy a society by destroying its sexual morality.
[01:35:08.302 --> 01:35:11.703]  This is fundamental in any society based on the family.
[01:35:12.403 --> 01:35:21.666]  When our children are naturally in this theta brainwave state of hypnotic learning, they should be protected within the family and learn from them organically.
[01:35:22.338 --> 01:35:30.747]  But the emerging global state, now being forced on us by multinational corporations and big banks, want to destroy this society.
[01:35:31.367 --> 01:35:35.652]  They want to mold our children, exploit them, and even castrate them.
[01:35:36.710 --> 01:35:40.373]  It is now being promoted in highly produced, inspirational show tunes.
[01:35:41.133 --> 01:35:43.635]  And they draft laws to help facilitate all of this.
[01:35:44.055 --> 01:35:57.004]  A Republican senator who has produced such films as Breeding Farm, about women being kidnapped and forcibly bred for babies to be sold on the black market before they are fed to cannibals, is pushing a bill to fund film and television.
[01:35:57.745 --> 01:35:58.906]  This is the new normal.
[01:35:59.586 --> 01:36:03.189]  This is the inverted reality being programmed into our minds.
[01:36:04.335 --> 01:36:07.857]  Decades of traumatic abuse has demonstrably hurt Britney Spears.
[01:36:08.397 --> 01:36:11.559]  The human mind can only handle so much for so long.
[01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:15.542]  Britney is a tragic symptom of society's indifference.
[01:36:16.222 --> 01:36:21.005]  Because if enough of us really wanted to, we could change all of this right now.
[01:36:22.466 --> 01:36:24.347]  For InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[01:36:41.878 --> 01:36:44.819]  And we got about 10-15 minutes left with Michael Malice.
[01:36:44.919 --> 01:36:47.480]  I really appreciate him being here in Austin.
[01:36:47.500 --> 01:36:49.881]  Very excited he's moving here because I'm a big fan.
[01:36:49.901 --> 01:36:52.481]  What were we talking about before break?
[01:36:52.501 --> 01:36:53.362]  Hellfire Clubs!
[01:36:54.322 --> 01:36:58.383]  You got into some secret satanic group and you don't even remember what we were talking about?
[01:36:58.463 --> 01:36:59.844]  Is this what it's like being Alex Jones?
[01:37:00.404 --> 01:37:01.184]  I actually forgot about that.
[01:37:01.624 --> 01:37:05.566]  No, I mean, don't you think that if you are the Satanist, you obviously want Alex to come to the party?
[01:37:07.646 --> 01:37:09.767]  I think Alex would be the one who sacrificed.
[01:37:10.765 --> 01:37:11.946]  Like Burning Man, yeah.
[01:37:12.566 --> 01:37:13.286]  No, no, seriously.
[01:37:14.607 --> 01:37:18.148]  For whatever reason, I've had the Satanist trying to recruit me since I was like a teenager.
[01:37:18.248 --> 01:37:18.568]  Okay.
[01:37:18.849 --> 01:37:22.090]  And I grew up in Dallas in a very rich area and there was some of that going on.
[01:37:22.110 --> 01:37:26.092]  I'm like, why is this senior in high school when I'm a freshman taking me out in a Mercedes?
[01:37:26.152 --> 01:37:28.133]  You know, there's like a little bit of weird stuff going on.
[01:37:28.473 --> 01:37:31.974]  But I never got into the satanic cults, though a few times they almost got me involved.
[01:37:32.334 --> 01:37:35.116]  And one time I actually walked out of an event that was like eyes wide shut.
[01:37:35.376 --> 01:37:35.896]  I'm not kidding.
[01:37:36.758 --> 01:37:37.881]  I'm sorry, you're nuts.
[01:37:39.525 --> 01:37:40.287]  Lay out the story.
[01:37:40.588 --> 01:37:42.051]  How does one get an invite?
[01:37:42.111 --> 01:37:43.735]  What's the invite look like to an event like this?
[01:37:44.543 --> 01:37:49.845]  Uh, well I don't look like it now, but I was super good looking when I was young, and the whole nine yards, and I was also, you know, a wild guy.
[01:37:50.205 --> 01:37:52.626]  So they sort of like, hey, super hot girls are like, hey, we want to hang out with you.
[01:37:52.646 --> 01:37:53.846]  Oh, so you just say it's like a regular party?
[01:37:53.886 --> 01:37:55.647]  No, the woman has sex with you a few times.
[01:37:55.887 --> 01:37:55.987]  Okay.
[01:37:56.007 --> 01:37:57.467]  Then she goes, I want you to go to this event.
[01:37:58.247 --> 01:37:58.307]  Oh!
[01:37:58.327 --> 01:38:00.828]  And then all of a sudden you're in a mansion with helicopter pads.
[01:38:00.948 --> 01:38:01.248]  Okay.
[01:38:01.348 --> 01:38:02.869]  And people, and it's Satanism.
[01:38:03.289 --> 01:38:03.529]  Okay.
[01:38:03.729 --> 01:38:04.970]  And both times I'm like, I'm leaving.
[01:38:05.310 --> 01:38:06.450]  How did you know it was Satanism?
[01:38:09.571 --> 01:38:11.452]  Anyways, you seen Eyes Wide Shut?
[01:38:11.472 --> 01:38:11.932]  Stuff like that.
[01:38:13.050 --> 01:38:20.471]  So, then Hollywood tried to get me involved, and Linklater wasn't involved in all this, but he put me in a few movies.
[01:38:20.491 --> 01:38:21.912]  Who's Linklater?
[01:38:22.412 --> 01:38:23.052]  Richard Linklater?
[01:38:23.072 --> 01:38:23.552]  Okay, who's that?
[01:38:23.792 --> 01:38:25.632]  He's a movie producer.
[01:38:25.932 --> 01:38:27.033]  He was never involved in that.
[01:38:27.073 --> 01:38:27.613]  He's in Austin.
[01:38:27.633 --> 01:38:28.293]  He didn't like Hollywood.
[01:38:28.753 --> 01:38:34.754]  But because of him putting me in a few of his films, he contacted me, Scanner Darkly, Waking Life, and I was a consultant on some others.
[01:38:34.774 --> 01:38:36.755]  You know, hang out with Keanu Reeves, all those guys.
[01:38:37.035 --> 01:38:38.675]  They come to town, Woody Harrelson, Friends of the Mall.
[01:38:39.355 --> 01:38:40.556]  And they weren't devil worshippers, by the way.
[01:38:40.576 --> 01:38:42.437]  They were like separate from Hollywood and didn't want to be a part of it.
[01:38:42.457 --> 01:38:44.319]  But then I got kind of sucked into Hollywood for a while.
[01:38:44.339 --> 01:38:46.160]  I was in some major parties with all the top people.
[01:38:46.200 --> 01:38:47.601]  I mean, very small, tight-knit deals.
[01:38:48.682 --> 01:38:50.683]  And then I got an offer from Oxford.
[01:38:51.164 --> 01:38:51.704]  The letter was here.
[01:38:51.724 --> 01:38:52.965]  The producers saw it like eight years ago.
[01:38:52.985 --> 01:38:54.046]  University?
[01:38:54.086 --> 01:38:54.166]  Yeah.
[01:38:54.446 --> 01:38:56.868]  They wanted me to come speak to their commons.
[01:38:57.448 --> 01:38:58.509]  Their famous speech.
[01:38:58.549 --> 01:38:58.769]  Yes.
[01:38:59.850 --> 01:39:04.754]  And then I got a call from this big Hollywood individual and they said, yeah, I heard you got that letters.
[01:39:04.794 --> 01:39:05.595]  I hadn't announced this yet.
[01:39:06.095 --> 01:39:06.595]  And I said, yeah.
[01:39:06.615 --> 01:39:13.260]  And they said, yeah, no, you know, I went there and that's, what's going to be going on there is you're going to get invited to a club and some grottos down there.
[01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:14.982]  And it's an orgy and it's fun to get rid of everybody.
[01:39:15.622 --> 01:39:16.963]  Uh, but that's them wanting you in the club.
[01:39:17.424 --> 01:39:18.484]  I'm like, okay, this is a little bit crazy.
[01:39:18.524 --> 01:39:23.588]  Then I get another call from somebody in Hollywood saying, Hey, you're getting invited to the health fire club and I'm going to be there.
[01:39:24.189 --> 01:39:25.510]  And I just, I declined it.
[01:39:25.710 --> 01:39:29.313]  And I didn't go because once you start doing that, I mean, you know, it's like super hot chicks and sex.
[01:39:29.773 --> 01:39:30.633]  Everybody takes drugs.
[01:39:30.713 --> 01:39:31.274]  It's all whatever.
[01:39:31.294 --> 01:39:33.095]  I don't know people that have been involved in that stuff.
[01:39:33.115 --> 01:39:37.356]  And then, you know, the next time a hooker dies, you know, I mean, it's just like Eyes Wide Shut.
[01:39:37.397 --> 01:39:38.297]  It's exactly what you see.
[01:39:38.617 --> 01:39:46.841]  And, you know, I know Stanley Kubrick's daughter very well, Vivian, who was his protege, actually helped kind of direct some of his last films and did the music for him and stuff like Full Metal Jacket.
[01:39:47.381 --> 01:39:49.402]  And she told me a lot of stuff off record.
[01:39:49.442 --> 01:39:50.883]  They tried to get her dad to do this.
[01:39:50.923 --> 01:39:51.543]  He would be part of it.
[01:39:52.142 --> 01:39:55.764]  So how satanic are they on a scale of, like, satanic to, like, Marilyn Manson, right?
[01:39:55.805 --> 01:40:02.889]  Like, Marilyn Manson plays this up, but he's a performer, like, he's not a good person, fine, but he's not really, you know, sacrificing... No, he's doing it for shock value.
[01:40:02.909 --> 01:40:04.010]  He's doing it for shock value, right.
[01:40:04.230 --> 01:40:21.742]  No, these people have billions of dollars, they have huge mansions, and they like the, you know, the craziness of all these rich people showing up in masks, because you're rich and powerful, so if you just go out and swing with people, uh, you know, because you're whatever, you know, you want to have fun, they're gonna rat you out.
[01:40:22.683 --> 01:40:23.023]  I don't know.
[01:40:38.045 --> 01:40:39.045]  They tried to recruit me to that.
[01:40:39.345 --> 01:40:41.646]  I mean, John Harmon is my oldest producer here.
[01:40:41.706 --> 01:40:42.806]  He does affiliate relations now.
[01:40:43.126 --> 01:40:45.446]  He's worked with me for 19 years, 18 years.
[01:40:46.046 --> 01:40:49.927]  And he was right there when Rothkopf, the Kissinger Group, tried to hire me and said, come to New York.
[01:40:50.567 --> 01:40:51.227]  We're going to hire you.
[01:40:51.287 --> 01:40:52.668]  And I said, this is not off record.
[01:40:52.688 --> 01:40:53.188]  He's like, no.
[01:40:53.868 --> 01:40:55.788]  So he said, join the New World Order.
[01:40:55.868 --> 01:40:56.228]  Come here.
[01:40:56.288 --> 01:40:57.268]  We're the elite.
[01:40:57.288 --> 01:40:59.189]  You're going to lead the liberty movement, all this stuff.
[01:40:59.449 --> 01:41:00.989]  So I got the William F. Buckley speech.
[01:41:01.049 --> 01:41:04.650]  I know he got, or he's probably put there up front from Yale.
[01:41:04.670 --> 01:41:06.670]  I mean, I've been literally given the speech.
[01:41:07.699 --> 01:41:12.943]  By Rothkopf and then three other times off record, up in the top of a 50-story building, you know.
[01:41:13.704 --> 01:41:16.086]  And like, I mean, I had this major CEO of a major media company.
[01:41:16.106 --> 01:41:17.167]  He goes, you like my wife?
[01:41:17.968 --> 01:41:20.189]  She goes, you can f*** my wife right now in front of me.
[01:41:20.390 --> 01:41:21.530]  Just sign this contract, Alex.
[01:41:21.551 --> 01:41:22.551]  You're going to be a star.
[01:41:23.152 --> 01:41:24.233]  And the woman was incredibly hot.
[01:41:25.234 --> 01:41:26.575]  Like Elvira, but in her prime.
[01:41:26.855 --> 01:41:28.396]  He goes, you want to f*** my wife right now?
[01:41:28.416 --> 01:41:29.137]  You can f*** my wife.
[01:41:29.157 --> 01:41:29.837]  You can get everything you want.
[01:41:30.198 --> 01:41:33.921]  I just want you to join us right now and be a star and not be on this felled crusade you're on.
[01:41:34.724 --> 01:41:34.945]  Wow.
[01:41:35.126 --> 01:41:38.804]  I've literally had a CIA former section chief get on his knees.
[01:41:39.915 --> 01:41:42.276]  And asked me to join Obama and they would fix everything.
[01:41:42.296 --> 01:41:43.077]  The guy was crying.
[01:41:43.697 --> 01:41:47.499]  And I'm not trying to tell you this stuff like, you know, like, I mean, this is real.
[01:41:47.959 --> 01:41:49.159]  This, this really goes on.
[01:41:49.199 --> 01:41:51.841]  This is how they want you to sell your soul to them.
[01:41:52.281 --> 01:41:53.381]  You literally get the offers.
[01:41:53.661 --> 01:41:57.843]  But isn't the concern that then you're going to out them or is it that they're so powerful that no one's going to believe you?
[01:41:58.064 --> 01:42:00.585]  Oh, let me explain the reason I'm not being killed or put in prison.
[01:42:00.605 --> 01:42:01.185]  Yeah, please.
[01:42:01.245 --> 01:42:05.287]  The minute you take anything from them, they will kill your ass in a second.
[01:42:05.367 --> 01:42:05.627]  Okay.
[01:42:23.490 --> 01:42:24.491]  I don't know, six, seven years.
[01:42:24.871 --> 01:42:25.151]  Is it?
[01:42:25.171 --> 01:42:26.352]  No, no, five years.
[01:42:26.572 --> 01:42:29.614]  I don't know if you're familiar with the historian Thaddeus Russell.
[01:42:29.734 --> 01:42:31.255]  I was on his show, he was on mine, I don't remember.
[01:42:31.535 --> 01:42:34.237]  By the way, that wasn't fiction, I just told you.
[01:42:34.257 --> 01:42:35.217]  That's all that's real.
[01:42:35.377 --> 01:42:40.020]  Okay, so Thad made the point that both of Obama's parents were CAA.
[01:42:40.040 --> 01:42:40.581]  They were, yeah.
[01:42:40.601 --> 01:42:43.382]  This is not Alex Jones making, you know, whatever.
[01:42:43.442 --> 01:42:44.023]  You could look it up.
[01:42:44.083 --> 01:42:44.643]  Oh, it's a fact.
[01:42:46.364 --> 01:42:47.005]  And the grandfather.
[01:42:47.185 --> 01:42:48.987]  Yeah, so can you talk a little about that?
[01:42:49.007 --> 01:42:53.111]  Because again, as soon as someone says the word CIA, we're trained to think this person's crazy, right?
[01:42:53.652 --> 01:42:56.394]  Well, my dad got recruited by a group above the CIA.
[01:42:56.555 --> 01:42:57.155]  What's above the CIA?
[01:42:57.175 --> 01:42:57.656]  Like the BIA?
[01:42:57.916 --> 01:42:58.957]  It doesn't even have a name.
[01:42:59.117 --> 01:42:59.357]  Okay.
[01:42:59.758 --> 01:43:04.382]  Because he was top of his class in the state, and so in high school he was at UT already.
[01:43:05.043 --> 01:43:10.505]  And he thought his mom was like a principal and academic and you know, had a degree in English and all this stuff.
[01:43:11.545 --> 01:43:14.827]  And it was like a PhD in English or whatever, so she knew Shakespeare forwards and backwards.
[01:43:14.847 --> 01:43:17.167]  When I was a little kid, I'd go there to read me Shakespeare all day.
[01:43:17.548 --> 01:43:18.048]  Smart lady.
[01:43:18.888 --> 01:43:21.249]  She was like, well, I want to sign David up for NASA.
[01:43:22.110 --> 01:43:24.771]  And he wasn't being signed up for NASA, but he got out of it by college.
[01:43:26.052 --> 01:43:30.234]  By the time he was 15, it's like, we're sending you to MD Anderson for the summer.
[01:43:31.594 --> 01:43:34.635]  And it was like cancer research stuff.
[01:43:35.096 --> 01:43:39.097]  Like you'd think, oh, the CIA's all glamorous and this stuff's all fun.
[01:43:39.558 --> 01:43:50.262]  It was all saying, let's put kids in government research programs with lethal cancer drugs and see if they'll sit there while we're giving people lethal dosages and stuff just to see how they're affected by it.
[01:43:50.763 --> 01:43:51.363]  And so my dad,
[01:43:52.063 --> 01:43:53.783]  Later, after I was already on the air, he told me all this.
[01:43:53.804 --> 01:43:55.104]  I mean, I knew about it from my grandmother.
[01:43:55.144 --> 01:43:59.885]  He was like in high school, whiz kid, you know, and doing all the stuff at UT and MD Anderson.
[01:44:00.165 --> 01:44:06.867]  But it wasn't until my film, Endgame, was about to come out 14 years ago, and he watched it at my studio before it was released.
[01:44:06.947 --> 01:44:09.228]  And my mother looks to him, she goes, David, this isn't true.
[01:44:09.688 --> 01:44:11.208]  And he just spilt his guts about all that.
[01:44:11.488 --> 01:44:12.929]  And it wasn't that he was even that special.
[01:44:13.349 --> 01:44:17.930]  Industrial level hiring of all the smartest brains to join this eugenics cult.
[01:44:18.703 --> 01:44:19.604]  I'm interviewing you, my friend.
[01:44:19.764 --> 01:44:20.444]  We're going.
[01:44:20.484 --> 01:44:23.166]  Sure you're interviewing me, but there's something I do really want to know.
[01:44:23.547 --> 01:44:34.135]  Is it your belief that Obama, and I don't think this is at all absurd, because how else did this end up happening, is it your belief that Obama was groomed from a young age to be a kind of CIA operative?
[01:44:34.855 --> 01:44:38.416]  Yes, and I would love to come on your show again and actually cover all this.
[01:44:39.136 --> 01:44:42.958]  There's a guy named Gilbert who cracked the case on this.
[01:44:43.758 --> 01:44:47.059]  They set up the whole Kenya thing as a setup to make us look like idiots.
[01:44:47.479 --> 01:44:48.680]  He was born in Hawaii.
[01:44:48.760 --> 01:44:49.460]  He's an American citizen.
[01:44:50.365 --> 01:44:56.993]  And he put in the Harvard Law Review that he was the editor of for two years that I was born in Kenya.
[01:44:57.013 --> 01:44:58.215]  It says it in the front.
[01:44:58.495 --> 01:45:04.763]  His wife says in speeches, Michelle, oh, I mean, my husband from like, you know, before he got elected is from Kenya.
[01:45:05.824 --> 01:45:07.866]  So that that was not his dad.
[01:45:08.752 --> 01:45:09.072]  Thank you.
[01:45:26.130 --> 01:45:30.373]  I was able, when I saw this, I thought this was so unbelievable, this came out like, what was it, eight years ago or whatever.
[01:45:31.114 --> 01:45:38.439]  I was not a big port-o-fishing, I know, but I knew I could go online and look at famous 1950s, 60s kind of Betty Page stuff.
[01:45:38.880 --> 01:45:40.081]  And there was his mom.
[01:45:40.141 --> 01:45:48.347]  These photos are online, the ones that are in a private collection with Obama's mother, who was a sex operative of the CIA.
[01:45:49.287 --> 01:45:52.230]  And it's admitted that he was basically given his degrees,
[01:45:53.493 --> 01:45:54.493]  He lived all over the world.
[01:45:54.873 --> 01:45:56.394]  His grandfather ran major banks.
[01:45:57.454 --> 01:45:59.835]  And Frank Marshall Davis was a double agent, FBI operative.
[01:45:59.875 --> 01:46:01.955]  His mom was a CIA sex operative.
[01:46:02.716 --> 01:46:03.916]  And absolutely so.
[01:46:05.376 --> 01:46:06.117]  That's the whole truth.
[01:46:06.157 --> 01:46:07.197]  And so he was not from Kenya.
[01:46:07.237 --> 01:46:08.217]  He was an American citizen.
[01:46:08.577 --> 01:46:09.798]  And they put that out.
[01:46:10.538 --> 01:46:10.998]  Day one.
[01:46:11.038 --> 01:46:13.259]  They're the ones that put that out to get us to chase after it.
[01:46:13.939 --> 01:46:16.040]  So that they would distract away from Frank Marshall Davis.
[01:46:16.480 --> 01:46:17.180]  Very skilled.
[01:46:17.708 --> 01:46:24.771]  Yeah, I think a lot of times, you know how people historically talk about the devil having a gilded tongue and being sophisticated?
[01:46:25.952 --> 01:46:29.653]  This is something else you think about when you're raised in a Russian household.
[01:46:30.214 --> 01:46:31.954]  Evil people are very sophisticated.
[01:46:32.094 --> 01:46:35.036]  They're not going to come in there with a shirt that says, I'm the bad guy.
[01:46:35.296 --> 01:46:36.936]  They're not going to have horns and tails.
[01:46:36.956 --> 01:46:39.738]  They're going to look just like you and me, or maybe more like you than like me.
[01:46:40.618 --> 01:46:47.703]  But it's not something that's going to be obvious, and they use these techniques to try to get people completely distracted.
[01:46:47.944 --> 01:46:48.704]  It's like misdirection.
[01:46:49.064 --> 01:46:53.268]  If you go to see Penn and Teller, his hand's doing this over here, but meanwhile he's doing something in his pocket.
[01:46:53.288 --> 01:46:54.709]  Well, exactly, and my dad was a good guy.
[01:46:54.729 --> 01:46:56.030]  He got out of it.
[01:46:57.070 --> 01:46:58.511]  He won't even ever tell me anything about this stuff.
[01:46:58.832 --> 01:47:01.253]  He just said, yeah, no, it was going on, and then...
[01:47:02.094 --> 01:47:02.274]  I don't
[01:47:17.938 --> 01:47:19.059]  Thank you.
[01:47:37.603 --> 01:47:38.124]  Here's an example.
[01:47:38.865 --> 01:47:46.735]  When he signed up for this, when he was like 14, he won this Union Carbide Award for an essay he wrote about physics or something.
[01:47:47.156 --> 01:47:53.164]  And all of a sudden, an 18-wheeler one day pulls up at our ranch in East Texas and says, here are the parts to a ruby laser.
[01:47:54.298 --> 01:47:57.539]  Build it, here's a camera, take photos of it, do it, see what you do.
[01:47:57.899 --> 01:48:08.602]  My dad built the laser, which wasn't fully explaining how to do it, turned it into a particle beam, and fried his eyes, was blind for a couple months, and yeah, then they were like, oh God, we really want you now, when he built the laser.
[01:48:09.082 --> 01:48:10.542]  So I'm just telling you, man, these people are crazy.
[01:48:10.842 --> 01:48:12.923]  But back then they were all into, let's test the HUMET,
[01:48:13.263 --> 01:48:14.124]  I think for most
[01:48:28.200 --> 01:48:31.042]  I'm sorry, I know you're supposed to be interviewing me, but this is one I really want to know.
[01:48:31.062 --> 01:48:39.206]  I think for most Americans, they don't really understand the distinction between the CIA and the FBI, and they view them as large interchangeables, both kind of security apparatus of the federal government.
[01:48:40.186 --> 01:48:42.047]  Is it like one of the good guys, one of the bad guys?
[01:48:42.088 --> 01:48:43.028]  Are they basically the same?
[01:48:43.108 --> 01:48:44.789]  It's the same thing.
[01:48:44.909 --> 01:48:50.272]  There's probably 10 factions in the CIA, probably 20 factions in the FBI.
[01:48:50.432 --> 01:48:51.112]  Everything's factions.
[01:48:51.693 --> 01:48:52.753]  This office is factions.
[01:48:53.254 --> 01:48:54.854]  I mean, it's just the way things work.
[01:48:55.015 --> 01:48:57.396]  And the FBI is...
[01:48:58.786 --> 01:49:04.451]  This through the legal system being counting cases, covering their ass, they're all about how they look and what they do.
[01:49:04.491 --> 01:49:07.273]  And the CIA is just balls-to-the-walls craziness.
[01:49:07.693 --> 01:49:14.719]  You know, just absolutely run everything, control everything, get control of every Hollywood star, get control of every organization, control influence, run it all.
[01:49:15.059 --> 01:49:17.581]  And really, it's just a bunch of people getting rich and having sex.
[01:49:18.562 --> 01:49:22.406]  Why haven't, or maybe they haven't... I mean the CIA is far more glamorous.
[01:49:22.847 --> 01:49:24.208]  Except that was the old CIA.
[01:49:24.709 --> 01:49:27.352]  Now every leftist wants the CIA credential to feel powerful.
[01:49:27.632 --> 01:49:32.097]  It's their little bean-counting academics that write up policy reports to control history.
[01:49:32.397 --> 01:49:33.058]  So there's two sides.
[01:49:33.078 --> 01:49:37.083]  The CIA that creates fake history, and then the CIA that actually runs around controlling things and killing people.
[01:49:37.503 --> 01:49:40.606]  But how does the FBI relate to those two positions?
[01:49:40.727 --> 01:49:50.657]  Like I said, the FBI is a Praetorian intimidation arm that is meant to bust low-level criminals and then put heat on people the political establishment wants.
[01:49:51.057 --> 01:49:55.522]  So it's like the GRU in Russia, it's internal, and the KGB would be external.
[01:49:56.043 --> 01:49:58.725]  Like FSB is external and then
[01:49:59.406 --> 01:50:01.528]  You know, same thing with the CIA, supposedly external.
[01:50:01.808 --> 01:50:09.094]  I mean, on paper, the FBI is domestic and the CIA is international, but it's just, it's inter... The CIA is British intelligence.
[01:50:09.174 --> 01:50:09.474]  Okay.
[01:50:09.674 --> 01:50:11.336]  The CIA was set up by British intelligence.
[01:50:11.716 --> 01:50:14.879]  It's not... Again, it's not that the British run us.
[01:50:15.239 --> 01:50:16.540]  We absorb the British.
[01:50:16.700 --> 01:50:16.900]  Yeah.
[01:50:17.321 --> 01:50:17.921]  And that's what it is.
[01:50:18.302 --> 01:50:21.944]  So this is the question I can't believe it took me this long to ask, given all the time we've talked.
[01:50:22.845 --> 01:50:25.349]  Uh, J. Edgar Hoover was there since Woodrow Wilson.
[01:50:25.569 --> 01:50:27.712]  I think he, I don't know when he died, but it was at least Nixon.
[01:50:28.312 --> 01:50:29.234]  He was around in the 20s.
[01:50:29.394 --> 01:50:31.396]  Yeah, is he as... He invented library cards!
[01:50:32.177 --> 01:50:33.279]  Tell me, like, let's hear about it.
[01:50:33.379 --> 01:50:36.423]  Yes, he is such an important figure that we don't discuss.
[01:50:37.084 --> 01:50:38.505]  Well, he's the father of the surveillance.
[01:50:38.605 --> 01:50:39.166]  Yes, he is.
[01:50:39.847 --> 01:50:42.109]  Yeah, that's what the FBI does is blackmail people.
[01:50:42.209 --> 01:50:42.409]  Right.
[01:50:42.669 --> 01:50:45.111]  And then it's the group that's allowed to blackmail domestically.
[01:50:45.131 --> 01:50:51.636]  Because again, if you're going to set up an intelligence agency to blackmail and kill foreigners, you don't want to turn that big great white shark loose domestically.
[01:50:51.977 --> 01:50:56.120]  So then you have with lawyers this domestic thing you supposedly keep controlled.
[01:50:56.600 --> 01:50:57.321]  But of course it doesn't.
[01:50:57.341 --> 01:51:04.567]  I mean, now the Capitol, the Democrats passed $2 billion to create a new Praetorian Guard where they're setting up offices of the Capitol Police around the country.
[01:51:04.887 --> 01:51:05.288]  Is that true?
[01:51:05.508 --> 01:51:07.250]  Oh yeah.
[01:51:07.450 --> 01:51:12.876]  Is J. Edgar Hoover as malevolent a figure as many people perceive him to be?
[01:51:14.859 --> 01:51:15.539]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:51:15.619 --> 01:51:17.502]  I mean, he definitely was blackmailing.
[01:51:18.162 --> 01:51:24.370]  I've seen the hearings and I've read the transcripts in the early 50s where he would get up in Congress and say, Lacosta Nostra does not exist.
[01:51:24.950 --> 01:51:25.150]  What?
[01:51:25.771 --> 01:51:25.971]  Yeah.
[01:51:26.051 --> 01:51:26.632]  The Mafia?
[01:51:26.772 --> 01:51:36.242]  They would say the Mafia doesn't exist and it wasn't until they wiretapped and recorded that upstate New York meeting of the mobsters that they had to prove it because good FBI agents documented it.
[01:51:36.262 --> 01:51:37.564]  So there's been a lot of great FBI agents.
[01:51:39.141 --> 01:51:55.914]  But I mean, the old FBI was like anti-communist and they got the FBI to do illegal things in the name of fighting communism, but then they lost their soul in that process and now the FBI is just... I mean, the average FBI agent that deals with bank robberies and kidnapped kids are good people, but that's one FBI.
[01:51:56.194 --> 01:52:00.578]  Then you've got the FBI at the top that's totally political, jacked into everything and just involved in everything.
[01:52:01.078 --> 01:52:05.081]  So is it true that he basically had president after president under his thumb?
[01:52:05.882 --> 01:52:07.567]  Yes, and they finally got sick of him.
[01:52:07.587 --> 01:52:08.350]  He was probably killed.
[01:52:08.610 --> 01:52:08.851]  Okay.
[01:52:09.880 --> 01:52:11.582]  Huh.
[01:52:11.682 --> 01:52:14.704]  That's a name that I think is not commonly used in America anymore.
[01:52:15.125 --> 01:52:18.087]  And his power, he was much more powerful in many ways than Kennedy was.
[01:52:18.528 --> 01:52:21.430]  But everyone knows who JFK is, but J. Edgar Hoover is not a household name.
[01:52:21.450 --> 01:52:25.233]  Well, J. Edgar Hoover is the great example of the deep state.
[01:52:25.273 --> 01:52:26.474]  Right, he's the deep state.
[01:52:26.554 --> 01:52:27.715]  That's the exact right.
[01:52:28.216 --> 01:52:34.501]  The things they did with Martin Luther King, I think every president knew he had a dossier on them and he would sit them down and tell them this is how it is and how it's going to be.
[01:52:34.681 --> 01:52:35.582]  Yeah, like take Putin.
[01:52:35.642 --> 01:52:37.183]  Putin was obviously KGB.
[01:52:38.184 --> 01:52:40.005]  And was involved with all those things.
[01:52:40.045 --> 01:52:44.827]  But he was a power vacuum with Yeltsin, and he saw Russia being exploited.
[01:52:45.207 --> 01:52:51.950]  So he said, instead of foreign bankers running things, I'll just step in, carve stuff up, divide it up, and create some nationalism.
[01:52:51.970 --> 01:52:53.431]  But obviously a strongman in that model.
[01:52:54.671 --> 01:52:59.053]  So with him, it's not like he was this long-term character like Hoover.
[01:52:59.493 --> 01:53:02.295]  But then at the end of the day, he is like the Russian deep state.
[01:53:02.755 --> 01:53:05.076]  But it's crazy to see a deep state where that's what they all want.
[01:53:06.435 --> 01:53:09.637]  The globalists envy Putin because he is actually in charge.
[01:53:09.957 --> 01:53:11.158]  He is actually the deep state.
[01:53:11.558 --> 01:53:13.579]  He actually came up through the system himself.
[01:53:13.899 --> 01:53:15.420]  And so he's what they all wish they were.
[01:53:15.700 --> 01:53:17.161]  So you can say, yeah, he kills people.
[01:53:17.221 --> 01:53:21.844]  Yeah, he he does all this, but he is actually a guy that did it himself.
[01:53:22.204 --> 01:53:30.769]  And that's that's what they really fear is the embodiment of somebody that's a leader who is actually in charge and who is actually running the deep state itself at the same time.
[01:53:31.109 --> 01:53:33.250]  So that's like the trifecta of all the things they fear.
[01:53:33.370 --> 01:53:35.032]  But isn't that kind of like George H.W.
[01:53:35.052 --> 01:53:36.973]  Bush who was head of the CIA before?
[01:53:37.774 --> 01:53:38.555]  Very Putin-esque.
[01:53:38.975 --> 01:53:43.059]  But didn't have the charisma or gravitas or energy.
[01:53:43.519 --> 01:53:46.142]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:53:46.182 --> 01:53:47.023]  There's Uncle Vlad.
[01:53:47.183 --> 01:53:48.444]  Yeah, quite a character right there.
[01:53:48.984 --> 01:53:55.851]  And they can't stand it because he's beating them and he's promoting having kids and he's not perfect.
[01:53:56.411 --> 01:53:58.233]  But they hate him because he's not anti-human.
[01:53:58.633 --> 01:54:13.406]  Yeah, and also because he, I think, what Putin does, which drives people crazy, is when they try to, there was an interview recently, which I'm sure you saw, you probably covered, where people trying to get him to denounce certain aspects of Russian culture goes, what's the difference in America?
[01:54:13.426 --> 01:54:16.408]  You guys have, you pull the same shenanigans, so don't get on your high horse with me.
[01:54:17.709 --> 01:54:24.555]  Well, he said, you've got 500 people, most of them just walked in to the velvet ropes, you've got them in solitary confinement.
[01:54:24.935 --> 01:54:25.976]  So I got, so I've,
[01:54:27.455 --> 01:54:30.397]  Yeah, it's like, make sure your house is clean before you're criticizing me.
[01:54:30.998 --> 01:54:34.100]  He said, get the beam out of your eye before you get the speck out of mine.
[01:54:34.240 --> 01:54:44.467]  Yeah, he's not a good person to put it mildly, but to claim that he's the villain and everyone in Washington... Well, he's not trying to convince Russian boys to chop their testicles off.
[01:54:45.948 --> 01:54:46.369]  That's true.
[01:54:47.267 --> 01:54:48.108]  No, I mean, seriously.
[01:54:49.229 --> 01:54:50.230]  I'm all for Russia.
[01:54:50.610 --> 01:54:51.451]  I'm all for China.
[01:54:51.511 --> 01:54:53.232]  I'm all for Venezuela.
[01:54:53.292 --> 01:54:53.753]  I don't care.
[01:54:54.213 --> 01:54:58.237]  I want leaders that want to empower their people, empower families, and empower free speech.
[01:54:58.717 --> 01:55:05.884]  And I know Putin, they'll go, oh my God, Putin arrested these people that are going and desecrating churches to create a riot, CIA funded.
[01:55:06.144 --> 01:55:12.690]  Well, I don't want to put up with the Russians sending agents to piss on Orthodox churches or whatever.
[01:55:12.750 --> 01:55:13.411]  I'd say arrest them.
[01:55:14.111 --> 01:55:16.232]  These are foreign powers trying to bring down Russia.
[01:55:16.452 --> 01:55:17.433]  I'm not a Russophile.
[01:55:17.453 --> 01:55:22.695]  I've never even been to Russia, but I can see a country under leftist attack that is trying to reject it.
[01:55:23.176 --> 01:55:25.037]  So I think Russians should all have their free speech.
[01:55:25.297 --> 01:55:29.219]  But if you're not a Russian and you're there trying to cause a riot, arrest you and throw your ass out of the country.
[01:55:29.239 --> 01:55:30.279]  Wait, you've never been to Russia?
[01:55:30.339 --> 01:55:30.479]  Nope.
[01:55:30.839 --> 01:55:31.960]  Oh, we definitely have to go then.
[01:55:32.340 --> 01:55:33.321]  That is going to be amazing.
[01:55:33.801 --> 01:55:36.802]  Well, you know, I'm the one on Twitter before it got banned that like they sent me my visa.
[01:55:36.862 --> 01:55:41.465]  I was going to go and then so much was going on and I was at a custody battle with my ex-wife and I said, I'm not going to go.
[01:55:42.065 --> 01:55:44.467]  They go, look, the secret visa, he's a Russian.
[01:55:44.707 --> 01:55:45.467]  I put that out.
[01:55:46.788 --> 01:55:47.209]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:55:47.449 --> 01:55:47.969]  It's going to be fun.
[01:55:47.989 --> 01:55:48.690]  I want to go to Russia.
[01:55:48.910 --> 01:55:49.490]  Yeah, we'll do it.
[01:55:49.811 --> 01:55:50.911]  We'll do it as soon as it opens up.
[01:55:51.472 --> 01:55:53.413]  But see, I was talking to Roger Stone when I first got indicted.
[01:55:53.433 --> 01:55:54.414]  He goes, this is not a joke.
[01:55:54.434 --> 01:55:56.615]  And I said, stop saying you're getting indicted.
[01:55:56.635 --> 01:55:57.316]  This is ridiculous.
[01:55:57.336 --> 01:55:58.617]  Because I knew he wouldn't involve any of that.
[01:55:58.637 --> 01:56:00.438]  Because I was there trying to get WikiLeaks on.
[01:56:00.478 --> 01:56:01.559]  I knew WikiLeaks wouldn't talk to us.
[01:56:01.939 --> 01:56:03.740]  So the idea that we were in control of WikiLeaks was just insane.
[01:56:03.761 --> 01:56:04.381]  He worked there then.
[01:56:06.082 --> 01:56:07.403]  And we're going to go to Andrew Tarba, folks.
[01:56:07.423 --> 01:56:07.923]  We're going to break.
[01:56:07.963 --> 01:56:08.663]  I see him right there.
[01:56:09.264 --> 01:56:11.144]  Hey, listen, you've been asking me questions.
[01:56:11.184 --> 01:56:12.765]  So that was a joke when you said I'm interrupting.
[01:56:13.225 --> 01:56:15.306]  Well, no, I mean, I'm curious to hear your perspective.
[01:56:15.346 --> 01:56:20.128]  Anyone can, you know, there's lots of things that you're the only one who kind of has been covering this stuff for decades.
[01:56:20.649 --> 01:56:22.790]  And you always have an unorthodox point of view.
[01:56:23.510 --> 01:56:24.631]  Well, I want to go to Russia.
[01:56:24.911 --> 01:56:25.071]  Yeah.
[01:56:25.851 --> 01:56:26.831]  I want to go to Israel.
[01:56:26.891 --> 01:56:28.112]  Doesn't mean I work for the Jews either.
[01:56:28.792 --> 01:56:31.573]  You know, because when I said I was going to rush, they're like, oh my God, it's the proof!
[01:56:31.993 --> 01:56:33.634]  Think about what a red scare that is.
[01:56:33.934 --> 01:56:41.777]  And now the left never really went through much of a red scare compared to what they've done now with de-platforming and talk about McCarthy, the stuff they've done to Andrew Torba.
[01:56:41.837 --> 01:56:43.377]  What about Mitch McConnell?
[01:56:43.397 --> 01:56:44.978]  They call him Moscow Mitch.
[01:56:45.098 --> 01:56:48.379]  I mean, they accuse him basically of treason on a regular basis.
[01:56:48.399 --> 01:56:49.920]  And I bet it called him Beijing Mitch.
[01:56:50.380 --> 01:56:50.820]  Is that true?
[01:56:51.440 --> 01:56:53.081]  Oh no, but they should.
[01:56:53.101 --> 01:56:55.122]  He's more connected to China than he is to Putin.
[01:56:55.362 --> 01:56:56.882]  I don't want to take up Andrew's time.
[01:56:57.423 --> 01:56:58.023]  Hey, listen.
[01:56:58.483 --> 01:57:00.644]  I appreciate you spending so much time with us on this Saturday.
[01:57:01.124 --> 01:57:02.425]  Andrew Torba is amazing.
[01:57:02.445 --> 01:57:03.986]  We're going to talk to him in just one moment.
[01:57:04.286 --> 01:57:05.686]  But first, anything else you want to add?
[01:57:05.827 --> 01:57:06.527]  How do people find you?
[01:57:06.827 --> 01:57:10.609]  Just go to anarchisthandbook.com to get the latest book and Michael Malice on Twitter.
[01:57:10.809 --> 01:57:11.909]  And you're now an underwear model.
[01:57:12.490 --> 01:57:13.850]  Sheathunderwear.com, yes.
[01:57:13.870 --> 01:57:15.011]  We're going to have the ad shortly.
[01:57:15.231 --> 01:57:16.231]  You can see my junk.
[01:57:16.451 --> 01:57:17.852]  Wow, your girlfriend is a supermodel.
[01:57:18.635 --> 01:57:19.395]  By the way, I'm serious.
[01:57:21.256 --> 01:57:21.537]  Sure.
[01:57:22.857 --> 01:57:24.598]  She's the most beautiful woman I've ever met, yes.
[01:57:25.179 --> 01:57:25.719]  Alright, good.
[01:57:26.719 --> 01:57:27.180]  We like that.
[01:57:27.200 --> 01:57:30.081]  That's politically incorrect anyways.
[01:57:30.161 --> 01:57:31.082]  I would love her if she was a 6.
[01:57:32.402 --> 01:57:32.823]  But she's a... 11.
[01:57:33.443 --> 01:57:35.184]  In Spinal Tap, 11.
[01:57:35.644 --> 01:57:36.244]  In real life, 11.
[01:57:36.945 --> 01:57:37.905]  Why not just have it be higher?
[01:57:38.005 --> 01:57:38.265]  But it's 11!
[01:57:39.682 --> 01:57:40.803]  All right, Michael Malice.
[01:57:40.823 --> 01:57:41.563]  It was a good interview, huh?
[01:57:42.043 --> 01:57:43.644]  I always have fun talking to you, Alex.
[01:57:43.664 --> 01:57:44.744]  And I hope you will find our interview.
[01:57:44.764 --> 01:57:46.145]  And the audience has fun, too.
[01:57:46.225 --> 01:57:49.427]  If you want to watch us, it's YouTube.com slash MichaelMaliceOfficial.
[01:57:49.647 --> 01:57:52.208]  Just look up Michael Malice Alex Jones on YouTube.
[01:57:52.248 --> 01:57:53.629]  It's the only video that hasn't been taken down.
[01:57:54.809 --> 01:57:55.209]  That's right.
[01:57:55.509 --> 01:57:56.410]  Thank you, Michael Malice.
[01:57:56.650 --> 01:58:00.192]  All right, Andrew Torba coming up straight ahead.
[01:58:00.232 --> 01:58:00.632]  Stay with us.
[01:58:01.377 --> 01:58:10.681]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by Infowars Life for those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[01:58:11.521 --> 01:58:18.884]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[01:58:19.564 --> 01:58:25.887]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive and muscle loss.
[01:58:26.727 --> 01:58:31.952]  Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on the market.
[01:58:32.573 --> 01:58:50.850]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms, including Uricoma longifolia, originally from Malaysia, Maca root from Peru, Horny Goatweed from China, and Tribulus from India.
[01:58:51.671 --> 01:58:55.214]  Reach your alpha male potential with Alpha Power.

[01:59:00.618 --> 01:59:20.132]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:59:21.863 --> 01:59:26.545]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this special Saturday transmission.
[01:59:26.565 --> 01:59:40.590]  A few days ago, the Southern Poverty Law Center came out with a report demonizing Twitter, and it used the same arguments it's used against our next guest, Mr. Torba, who
[01:59:42.247 --> 01:59:53.332]  He's just operating like the internet operated three years ago, where Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, anybody, let folks have their own sites on social media as long as they didn't call for violence or engage in criminal activity.
[01:59:53.752 --> 01:59:56.013]  So the founder of Gab, Andrew Torba, joins us.
[01:59:56.633 --> 01:59:59.554]  We really appreciate him taking time out of his busy schedule to talk about this.
[02:00:00.114 --> 02:00:08.318]  Well, within two days of this happening, Nick Fuentes, whether you love him or hate him, he has been banned as well.
[02:00:10.026 --> 02:00:12.968]  He's not just been suspended, he's been expelled, he's been permanently banned.
[02:00:13.729 --> 02:00:19.934]  And we have the SPLC policing Twitter saying that they're not banning all these conservatives.
[02:00:19.954 --> 02:00:22.496]  Well, they already banned the president, so that's not enough.
[02:00:22.556 --> 02:00:24.277]  So this is a very, very dangerous situation.
[02:00:24.297 --> 02:00:32.323]  It's the same thing they do to Gab and Andrew Torba and all their users saying, hey, we need government to shut them down.
[02:00:32.383 --> 02:00:33.264]  We need lawsuits.
[02:00:33.324 --> 02:00:37.688]  We need the FBI to get involved because somebody might say something they're not supposed to.
[02:00:38.308 --> 02:00:40.229]  Are you going to say something over the telephone you're not supposed to?
[02:00:40.269 --> 02:00:41.950]  Are you going to say something over the radio?
[02:00:41.970 --> 02:00:43.030]  Can you call on the talk radio?
[02:00:43.051 --> 02:00:44.231]  Are we going to have to ban that too?
[02:00:44.531 --> 02:00:45.752]  This is so draconian.
[02:00:45.912 --> 02:00:47.153]  It's obviously the threat.
[02:00:47.633 --> 02:00:50.815]  But you've got the left calling anyone that promotes freedom a white supremacist.
[02:00:51.815 --> 02:00:56.838]  And three weeks ago, the new policy report put out by the president, the puppet president saying,
[02:00:57.898 --> 02:00:59.899]  Questioning elections is terrorism.
[02:01:00.479 --> 02:01:02.740]  Questioning lockdowns is terrorism.
[02:01:02.760 --> 02:01:03.681]  This is so draconian.
[02:01:03.941 --> 02:01:05.982]  So, Andrew Torba, thanks for joining us.
[02:01:06.002 --> 02:01:19.968]  You're always a mild-mannered, polite fellow, but I'm going to try to give you the floor here in the next 20, 30 minutes to just lay out what's happened, what you've been through, and where you see this going, because you were just on the show three days ago, and you said, you know, they're going after everybody.
[02:01:20.048 --> 02:01:24.811]  Now they're going after Twitter, and Twitter is responding to this mob.
[02:01:24.871 --> 02:01:25.511]  It's so dangerous.
[02:01:26.994 --> 02:01:28.815]  Yeah Alex, well thank you for having me as always.
[02:01:28.875 --> 02:01:30.035]  It's a pleasure to be here.
[02:01:30.455 --> 02:01:33.496]  Let's look through the flax with this Nick Fuentes ban, right?
[02:01:33.516 --> 02:01:38.898]  So Nick is a Christian man who believes in putting America first and Americans first.
[02:01:38.938 --> 02:01:40.699]  That's, you know, that's his ideology.
[02:01:41.099 --> 02:01:42.140]  Nothing more, nothing less.
[02:01:42.860 --> 02:01:51.083]  We see the SPLC come out a few days ago and put a hit piece on Twitter as a whole with specifically targeting the fact that he was still on Twitter.
[02:01:51.581 --> 02:01:56.786]  The very next day we see the ADL come out and do a hit piece on Nick Fuentes as well.
[02:01:57.346 --> 02:02:00.009]  The day after that he was suspended by Twitter.
[02:02:00.049 --> 02:02:04.473]  So the question is does Twitter run its own company or do we have these special interest groups?
[02:02:04.918 --> 02:02:11.341]  Like the SPLC and the ADL that are, you know, strong arming these private companies into doing their bidding.
[02:02:12.061 --> 02:02:16.643]  This is really, I don't think it's a coincidence that, you know, Nick Fuentes is a Christian.
[02:02:16.783 --> 02:02:17.464]  You're a Christian.
[02:02:17.664 --> 02:02:18.324]  I'm a Christian.
[02:02:18.724 --> 02:02:20.685]  Who are the biggest targets of no platforming?
[02:02:20.785 --> 02:02:23.026]  Who are the people that the cabal is going after?
[02:02:23.502 --> 02:02:26.543]  It's Christians, and there's a very clear trend here.
[02:02:26.563 --> 02:02:33.644]  You know, you see the ADL calling for the Department of Justice to shut down my website because I allow free speech.
[02:02:34.004 --> 02:02:35.604]  Now, we don't allow threats of violence.
[02:02:35.665 --> 02:02:37.085]  We don't allow illegal activity.
[02:02:37.365 --> 02:02:42.866]  We actually have a really great relationship with law enforcement to keep criminals and criminal activity off of our website.
[02:02:43.306 --> 02:02:44.766]  But the ADL doesn't care about that.
[02:02:45.106 --> 02:02:49.187]  What they care about is controlling the narrative and controlling the flow of information.
[02:02:49.567 --> 02:02:52.508]  And because I refuse to bend to their demands,
[02:02:52.995 --> 02:02:57.477]  over banning certain people like yourself or others from our platform.
[02:02:58.137 --> 02:03:02.459]  They attack me personally, they come after my family, they want me locked up in jail.
[02:03:03.059 --> 02:03:13.644]  Alex, even the ADL, what they said is that because I sign my emails with the quote, Jesus is King, that that is a thinly veiled version of anti-Semitism.
[02:03:13.704 --> 02:03:18.086]  So they're saying that as a Christian, me saying Jesus is King is anti-Semitism.
[02:03:18.493 --> 02:03:23.435]  This should be a very big wake-up call to all the Christians who are watching, and by the way, to non-Christians as well.
[02:03:24.156 --> 02:03:29.298]  We are being targeted for simply allowing the free flow of information and for people to speak their minds.
[02:03:29.698 --> 02:03:31.039]  We don't allow illegal activity.
[02:03:31.099 --> 02:03:32.400]  We don't allow threats of violence.
[02:03:32.980 --> 02:03:34.841]  We've always had a very clear line on that.
[02:03:35.581 --> 02:03:38.022]  But, you know, we're going to have to do something about this.
[02:03:38.042 --> 02:03:39.003]  We're going to have to build.
[02:03:39.603 --> 02:03:44.626]  You know, what they want to do, Alex, and I think you understand this quite well, is they're trying to gaslight us into violence.
[02:03:44.646 --> 02:03:45.306]  They're trying to see
[02:03:45.799 --> 02:03:49.142]  How far can they push us before we start to get violent?
[02:03:49.222 --> 02:03:54.647]  And I would strongly recommend not falling for that deception and manipulation and a trap.
[02:03:55.127 --> 02:03:58.129]  What we need to do, you know, regimes come and go, right Alex?
[02:03:58.550 --> 02:04:05.536]  All throughout history, powerful tyrannical regimes have come and gone, and yet our people remain, and yet the patriots remain.
[02:04:06.056 --> 02:04:12.623]  We will rebuild and we are rebuilding right now and that's what I would recommend to people is start to build right now.
[02:04:13.203 --> 02:04:28.139]  And that's why they hate you because you are a real Christian, you love God and you're married and you're having children and you're betting on humanity and they're threatened by that and everybody knows you're not a white supremacist and it just flies in the face of them invoking that shows they're the race baiters, they're the racist.
[02:04:29.366 --> 02:04:30.006]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:04:30.026 --> 02:04:38.152]  Yeah, I'm a straight white Christian male with a family and I'm married and I have kids and I am enemy number one to this tyrannical regime, right?
[02:04:38.212 --> 02:04:47.538]  I am everything that they loathe and everything that they hate, you know, because I love Jesus Christ and I proclaim his name very openly as a public figure, as the CEO of a social network.
[02:04:47.878 --> 02:04:53.302]  There are no other public social media CEOs that are proclaiming the name of Christ, that I can tell you.
[02:04:53.957 --> 02:05:01.442]  And that is one of the big reasons why I think that they're attacking me so much is because they know that Christ and the gospel is really the only way out of this.
[02:05:01.542 --> 02:05:03.464]  It's the only thing that's going to give people hope.
[02:05:03.844 --> 02:05:08.647]  It's the only thing that's going to give people salvation from... Oh, they fear it, which is why we know it's real.
[02:05:09.127 --> 02:05:10.508]  And 2,000 years ago, we were told what would happen.
[02:05:10.749 --> 02:05:12.250]  It's happening exactly right now.
[02:05:13.270 --> 02:05:13.550]  Oh, yeah.
[02:05:13.610 --> 02:05:14.911]  Christ warned us about this, Alex.
[02:05:14.951 --> 02:05:18.214]  Christ warned us that, you know, first they came for Him and they're going to come for us.
[02:05:19.059 --> 02:05:20.480]  We will be persecuted.
[02:05:20.561 --> 02:05:22.042]  We can expect this as Christians.
[02:05:22.082 --> 02:05:26.867]  For 2,000 years we've been persecuted, you know, for loving Christ and for sharing the gospel.
[02:05:27.167 --> 02:05:28.889]  And that doesn't mean that we should cower in fear.
[02:05:28.909 --> 02:05:32.512]  I think a lot of Christians, you know, are afraid of their identity.
[02:05:32.552 --> 02:05:35.175]  They're afraid of proclaiming the name of Christ.
[02:05:35.255 --> 02:05:37.317]  They don't talk about Christ at work.
[02:05:37.337 --> 02:05:38.738]  They don't talk about Christ at school.
[02:05:38.778 --> 02:05:40.400]  They don't talk about Christ with their friends.
[02:05:41.040 --> 02:05:43.403]  So, you know, they basically are an in-the-closet Christian.
[02:05:43.703 --> 02:05:45.565]  And that's not how we're commanded to live.
[02:05:45.605 --> 02:05:52.032]  We're commanded to speak the truth boldly and to make disciples out of all the nations and to share the Word of God with other people.
[02:05:52.612 --> 02:05:59.800]  If, you know, we're just living this private life where, you know, we're only Christian when we walk in a church on Sunday, that's not very Christian life.
[02:05:59.980 --> 02:06:04.721]  And as depressing as this is, it actually makes me rejoice to see it all being fulfilled.
[02:06:04.741 --> 02:06:06.042]  It means my God's real.
[02:06:06.342 --> 02:06:07.562]  I've already had spiritual experiences.
[02:06:07.602 --> 02:06:08.542]  I already know it's real.
[02:06:08.903 --> 02:06:13.604]  I've already, I won't get into it on air, but I've prayed to God and things, and I've just been shown amazing things.
[02:06:14.404 --> 02:06:19.265]  So as negative as it is, God has sent me the Holy Spirit as a comforter that the Bible talks about.
[02:06:19.305 --> 02:06:20.346]  I've now experienced that.
[02:06:20.606 --> 02:06:23.867]  And it seems like, I've known you for a long time, since you launched this five, six years ago.
[02:06:24.207 --> 02:06:27.948]  You're a Christian, but it seems like your faith has gotten stronger under persecution.
[02:06:29.033 --> 02:06:29.514]  Absolutely.
[02:06:29.634 --> 02:06:35.664]  No, I mean the Holy Spirit has radically transformed my heart, my mind, my body, and my soul.
[02:06:35.684 --> 02:06:41.234]  And you know by clinging to that cross and embracing my faith and embracing Christ,
[02:06:42.041 --> 02:06:44.443]  You know, when I'm persecuted, that's what I do.
[02:06:45.364 --> 02:06:46.485]  I look to my Bible.
[02:06:46.605 --> 02:06:47.045]  I pray.
[02:06:47.065 --> 02:06:51.368]  I ask for prayer from our community members of millions of Christians around the world.
[02:06:51.889 --> 02:06:54.110]  And that's what we need to do right now as Christians.
[02:06:54.411 --> 02:06:55.632]  We should not fear the world.
[02:06:55.652 --> 02:06:58.594]  We really have nothing to fear except for God.
[02:06:58.654 --> 02:06:59.014]  That's it.
[02:06:59.835 --> 02:07:01.296]  We have the nuclear weapons.
[02:07:02.717 --> 02:07:03.958]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[02:07:04.238 --> 02:07:06.560]  Jesus is the—we already got it all.
[02:07:07.657 --> 02:07:10.299]  We have the creator of the universe on our side.
[02:07:10.599 --> 02:07:20.107]  It doesn't matter how much money, how much power, how much resources that these people have, these wicked and evil people in power have, they do not have the creator of the universe on their side.
[02:07:20.487 --> 02:07:20.908]  We do.
[02:07:21.548 --> 02:07:34.959]  And we need to remember that, and we need to cling to the cross, and we need to share the gospel, and bring people to Christ, and get back to Christ, and get back in the church, and get back to building our families, building our local communities, and building up ourselves as well.
[02:07:35.680 --> 02:07:42.107]  You know, far too many people get sucked into the negativity and all of the horrific things that are going on.
[02:07:42.147 --> 02:07:46.532]  You know, we see them coming after our children now with this propaganda.
[02:07:46.592 --> 02:07:47.593]  We see them coming after...
[02:07:48.392 --> 02:07:55.175]  Our family members, we see them coming after our freedoms and our civil liberties, but what they can never come after is our faith.
[02:07:55.555 --> 02:08:00.618]  They can never take that away from us, and that's one thing that we really need to hold on to, especially now more than ever.
[02:08:01.118 --> 02:08:06.721]  That's the only way that we're going to come out of this on the other side, is by relying on God and leaning in on God.
[02:08:07.001 --> 02:08:07.401]  That's right.
[02:08:07.461 --> 02:08:11.803]  Andrew, since you raised this, I want to play a three and a half minute clip of the, quote,
[02:08:14.355 --> 02:08:16.496]  Quire, government-funded San Francisco.
[02:08:16.897 --> 02:08:20.519]  They attacked me this morning in a bunch of articles and said I called for violence.
[02:08:20.619 --> 02:08:20.999]  I did not.
[02:08:21.019 --> 02:08:23.321]  So I love that they make themselves the victims.
[02:08:23.361 --> 02:08:24.922]  They say, we're going to corrupt your kids.
[02:08:25.462 --> 02:08:26.703]  We're coming for your children.
[02:08:27.183 --> 02:08:28.584]  We're going to take them from you.
[02:08:29.065 --> 02:08:32.167]  And then we say, no, we don't want that with all the recruiting we see.
[02:08:32.947 --> 02:08:34.648]  And it's satanic.
[02:08:34.668 --> 02:08:35.849]  And you look at all these men.
[02:08:36.029 --> 02:08:36.629]  It's a cult.
[02:08:36.970 --> 02:08:38.130]  It's an army of men.
[02:08:39.278 --> 02:08:45.141]  Saying we're non-threatening, we act effeminate, but we're going to get your children, and then this is the zeitgeist.
[02:08:45.201 --> 02:08:46.222]  Everybody I know knows this.
[02:08:49.781 --> 02:08:53.263]  I don't hate people, guys because they like guys or girls because they like girls.
[02:08:54.304 --> 02:09:06.050]  But I know that whatever's happening with what they've done spiritually, that when you do that it opens you up to this anti-human spirit and the people that serve this then become these monsters that want to have my children.
[02:09:06.490 --> 02:09:09.832]  And so all I'm saying is, you know, leave me alone.
[02:09:09.852 --> 02:09:11.293]  They're like, no, we're not going to leave you alone.
[02:09:11.773 --> 02:09:17.918]  And they've got the full power, and Klaus Schwab, the head of the Deimos Group, says, we need more gay TV characters.
[02:09:18.198 --> 02:09:18.959]  Well, we know why.
[02:09:18.999 --> 02:09:20.260]  So no one has children.
[02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:33.670]  And so here's this pedophilic declaration of war against us, and then all these articles, gay men's chorus, jokes about converting kids, and Alex Jones pounces.
[02:09:34.071 --> 02:09:36.713]  But it's not a joke, and they won't show the video in the article.
[02:09:36.953 --> 02:09:39.335]  They want to just say, oh, nothing happened, Jones made this up.
[02:09:40.322 --> 02:09:41.404]  But we saved the video.
[02:09:41.664 --> 02:09:42.686]  Here's what they don't want you to see.
[02:09:52.324 --> 02:09:57.729]  And for the children and the people that support it are going to realize that this is going to be the grooming of the next generation.
[02:09:57.989 --> 02:10:03.294]  That's the whole goal is to make kids that aren't used to seeing something like me more comfortable to seeing it.
[02:10:03.554 --> 02:10:06.657]  No one's there to push an agenda on anyone.
[02:10:07.157 --> 02:10:11.841]  No one's there to persuade people or to recruit people.
[02:10:12.082 --> 02:10:14.283]  Who wants to be a drag queen when they grow up?
[02:10:14.464 --> 02:10:16.185]  You could be a drag queen superhero!
[02:10:16.545 --> 02:10:18.747]  Learn to love, learn to vogue, face your fate!
[02:10:21.462 --> 02:10:34.553]  We'll convert your children Someone's gotta teach them not to hate We're coming for them We're coming for your children
[02:10:48.107 --> 02:10:52.751]  Your children will care about fairness and justice for others.
[02:10:53.391 --> 02:10:57.995]  Your children will work to convert all your sisters and brothers.
[02:10:58.335 --> 02:11:06.922]  Then soon we're almost certain your kids will start converting you.
[02:11:10.333 --> 02:11:12.214]  The Gay Agenda is coming home!
[02:11:12.274 --> 02:11:14.096]  The Gay Agenda is here!
[02:11:14.276 --> 02:11:15.837]  But you don't have to worry!
[02:11:15.897 --> 02:11:17.458]  But you don't have to worry!
[02:11:17.518 --> 02:11:20.780]  Because there's nothing wrong with standing by your side!
[02:11:20.820 --> 02:11:21.901]  Get on board and get ready!
[02:11:21.941 --> 02:11:23.202]  Get on board and get ready!
[02:11:23.262 --> 02:11:25.723]  Because the world always seems a bit more bright!
[02:11:25.743 --> 02:11:26.544]  No, you don't have to worry!
[02:11:26.584 --> 02:11:27.605]  No, you don't have to worry!
[02:11:27.665 --> 02:11:30.446]  Because there's nothing wrong with standing by your side!
[02:11:30.466 --> 02:11:31.707]  Get on board and get ready!
[02:11:31.727 --> 02:11:33.629]  Get on board and get ready!
[02:11:33.689 --> 02:11:36.350]  Because the world always seems a bit more bright!
[02:11:39.389 --> 02:11:40.429]  It's almost over, folks.
[02:11:40.449 --> 02:11:40.969]  I'm sorry.
[02:11:41.009 --> 02:11:46.491]  We have to document this.
[02:11:46.511 --> 02:11:50.012]  Go and see San Francisco.
[02:11:50.072 --> 02:11:52.393]  Go and turn up that disco.
[02:11:52.433 --> 02:11:55.533]  You'll forget you were ever upset.
[02:11:55.553 --> 02:11:56.634]  We'll convert your children.
[02:12:26.855 --> 02:12:33.918]  And we have to warn you, ladies and gentlemen, if you've got young or impressionable children in your household, bring them to the screen right now.
[02:12:35.578 --> 02:12:40.665]  And we witnessed parents taking their children as young as two inside to take part.
[02:12:40.785 --> 02:12:42.607]  Talking, singing, and reading.
[02:12:43.228 --> 02:12:44.650]  We can both be grooms.
[02:12:44.770 --> 02:12:47.894]  To an audience of preschoolers, toddlers, and their caregivers.
[02:12:48.415 --> 02:12:49.997]  Family programming!
[02:12:50.818 --> 02:12:51.499]  Love it!
[02:12:51.699 --> 02:12:52.079]  Yas!
[02:12:52.239 --> 02:13:01.087]  We have just confirmed that a registered child sex offender has been reading to children at a Houston Public Library as part of its Drag Queen Story Hour.
[02:13:01.367 --> 02:13:09.755]  A media spokesperson for the library confirms one of those drag queens, Tatiana Malanina, is really Alberto Garza, a child sex offender.
[02:13:10.095 --> 02:13:13.358]  In 2008, he was convicted of assaulting an 8-year-old boy.
[02:13:13.618 --> 02:13:16.446]  This is Tatiana Valina, my sister from Queens of the Week.
[02:13:16.486 --> 02:13:18.853]  People seem to walk away having a good time.
[02:13:18.873 --> 02:13:20.036]  A stardom young, right?
[02:13:20.257 --> 02:13:21.581]  A stardom young, right?
[02:13:22.867 --> 02:13:25.770]  Alright, I appreciate Andrew Torba joining us on this Saturday.
[02:13:25.790 --> 02:13:27.051]  I got him on late, I apologize.
[02:13:27.392 --> 02:13:31.015]  No, he just had a great new addition to the family, a son.
[02:13:31.656 --> 02:13:35.180]  And to watch these people coming after our children, this is so satanic.
[02:13:35.640 --> 02:13:39.104]  And that's why Gab's there, so people have a place to say no to this.
[02:13:39.184 --> 02:13:43.508]  I mean, the lines between good and evil are so clear now.
[02:13:43.848 --> 02:13:46.071]  What do you think's happening and what's your response to that?
[02:13:47.537 --> 02:13:52.739]  Yeah, you know, as a father of two children now, this is just horrific to me, right?
[02:13:52.839 --> 02:13:53.540]  It's demonic.
[02:13:54.220 --> 02:13:55.420]  And this is what they're doing.
[02:13:55.500 --> 02:13:57.821]  They're telling us this, Alex.
[02:13:57.842 --> 02:13:59.702]  It's not even like they're trying to be subtle about it.
[02:14:00.062 --> 02:14:02.383]  They are telling us that they are coming for our children.
[02:14:02.403 --> 02:14:04.004]  And I'm so glad that you're documenting this.
[02:14:04.344 --> 02:14:05.145]  I know it's painful.
[02:14:05.325 --> 02:14:07.906]  It was painful for me to sit here and watch that.
[02:14:08.462 --> 02:14:10.823]  I think these things are being scrubbed from the internet.
[02:14:10.843 --> 02:14:17.085]  They scrubbed that video from YouTube after it came out that many of the people in that video were registered sex offenders.
[02:14:17.405 --> 02:14:19.565]  And this is every single time with these people.
[02:14:19.845 --> 02:14:22.086]  They say openly that we're coming for your kids.
[02:14:22.386 --> 02:14:25.647]  They're already registered sex offenders, so they have a history of coming for kids.
[02:14:25.967 --> 02:14:28.428]  And everybody sits around and just acts like this is normal.
[02:14:28.728 --> 02:14:31.749]  And meanwhile, if I say Jesus is king on Twitter, I get banned.
[02:14:32.096 --> 02:14:37.717]  This is madness, and this is why we must cling to the cross now more than ever, and we must bring people to the faith.
[02:14:38.177 --> 02:14:39.638]  And that's the only way out of this.
[02:14:39.738 --> 02:14:41.058]  Christ is the only way out of this.
[02:14:41.098 --> 02:14:44.558]  And by the way, we bow down to all these fake Protestant Catholic preachers, everything.
[02:14:44.578 --> 02:14:47.379]  I even saw the Orthodox Church endorse the vaccinations.
[02:14:48.159 --> 02:14:49.179]  We have to be leaders.
[02:14:49.259 --> 02:14:56.641]  We're humble people, but we have to be leaders, men and women, but men particularly, as you're saying, and just declare Jesus Christ.
[02:14:57.542 --> 02:14:58.384]  The churches won't do it.
[02:14:58.404 --> 02:15:00.470]  The churches are not even opposing most of this stuff.
[02:15:00.831 --> 02:15:02.074]  We have to be the church now.
[02:15:03.154 --> 02:15:06.555]  The churches are not only not opposing it, they're endorsing it.
[02:15:06.675 --> 02:15:09.296]  And you're right, it's at every level of the faith, right?
[02:15:09.716 --> 02:15:15.558]  It's Catholicism, it's Protestants, it's now the Orthodox Church is embracing the vaccines.
[02:15:15.918 --> 02:15:21.760]  So, it's every level of the church hierarchy across every branch of the faith has been subverted by the enemy.
[02:15:22.120 --> 02:15:26.521]  But the enemy has not subverted our own hearts, and the enemy has not subverted us as individuals.
[02:15:26.601 --> 02:15:32.403]  So, we need to get strong in our faith, we need to get strong in our own local communities and resist this stuff.
[02:15:32.876 --> 02:15:34.097]  And start building back.
[02:15:34.317 --> 02:15:36.819]  We need to build back and we need to build up.
[02:15:37.439 --> 02:15:39.381]  We are not destroyers, Alex.
[02:15:40.281 --> 02:15:44.804]  These people on the left and these demons that are in power, they're destroyers.
[02:15:45.105 --> 02:15:53.811]  They seek to imitate the gospel and subvert the gospel and subvert the words of Christ to subvert hundreds of millions of Christians to do their bidding.
[02:15:54.391 --> 02:15:56.212]  But that is not what the gospel is about.
[02:15:56.232 --> 02:15:58.414]  That was not what the message of Christ was about.
[02:15:59.074 --> 02:16:02.497]  And we need to hold fast to the truth that we know in our hearts
[02:16:02.915 --> 02:16:07.061]  And let the Holy Spirit guide us as leaders, as individuals in our own local communities.
[02:16:07.541 --> 02:16:13.770]  And you know, God has blessed both you and I with these tremendous platforms in front of so many millions of people.
[02:16:14.170 --> 02:16:19.558]  And we have to be great stewards of God's Word and great examples as Christians to other Christians.
[02:16:19.958 --> 02:16:25.981]  To give them hope because you know they're going to their church and they're not finding any resistance to this demonic stuff.
[02:16:26.022 --> 02:16:30.744]  In fact they're finding their pastors and their priests embracing this stuff which is madness.
[02:16:31.184 --> 02:16:35.667]  So you know we need to give people hope and we need to be positive and we need to embrace the power of God.
[02:16:35.687 --> 02:16:45.993]  I totally agree with you and you know we can sit here we can pull back from this but it's so obviously demonic what they're doing.
[02:16:46.874 --> 02:16:47.815]  Just like you were just saying.
[02:16:47.855 --> 02:16:50.758]  I mean, it's so anti-human.
[02:16:50.959 --> 02:16:52.841]  It's so obvious this should be rejected.
[02:16:53.101 --> 02:16:54.382]  And that's why they don't want a Gab.
[02:16:54.402 --> 02:16:55.904]  That's why they don't even want a Twitter.
[02:16:56.324 --> 02:17:01.770]  They don't want any place we can come together and agree that we're being gaslit.
[02:17:01.870 --> 02:17:04.453]  They hate what two of us do on Earth.
[02:17:05.154 --> 02:17:08.096]  And what two of us agree upon on earth, God agrees to in heaven.
[02:17:08.557 --> 02:17:19.265]  And that means when we're right, we know we're right, we love God, we make a decision as two humans together to do something about it, God uses that as the pretext of free will to then do it.
[02:17:19.666 --> 02:17:23.229]  We have to make the free will decision, then God gives us the electrical charge.
[02:17:23.309 --> 02:17:31.876]  And they fear in their takeover, with everything they do, Christians coming together, the lockdowns, banning churches, you know, a year after Walmart's open.
[02:17:32.136 --> 02:17:34.558]  They are so afraid of what's happening in these churches, brother.
[02:17:35.680 --> 02:17:42.805]  Yeah, and this is why I reject the term hate speech, because, you know, if you look at our Bible, we're commanded to hate that which is evil.
[02:17:43.085 --> 02:17:45.927]  We don't hate people, we hate the evil, right?
[02:17:45.967 --> 02:17:49.090]  And we're commanded to call it out and to speak the truth boldly.
[02:17:49.110 --> 02:17:54.694]  You know, we have no tolerance for evil, and we should have no tolerance for evil, but it seems
[02:17:55.114 --> 02:18:04.518]  Many Christians are openly embracing evil and embracing wickedness because they've just been misled and brainwashed by the enemy for so many decades now.
[02:18:05.058 --> 02:18:12.641]  And they're not reading their Bibles, they're not actively discussing Christ or the Gospel with their friends and their family or their co-workers.
[02:18:12.981 --> 02:18:17.744]  They basically walk into church on Sunday for an hour and they call themselves a Christian.
[02:18:17.845 --> 02:18:21.407]  And many of them aren't even doing that and still call themselves a Christian.
[02:18:22.128 --> 02:18:29.613]  Now is the time for a great revival and a great reformation in Christendom and in our own souls.
[02:18:30.153 --> 02:18:31.314]  We need to start with ourselves.
[02:18:31.354 --> 02:18:32.355]  Look in the mirror first.
[02:18:32.415 --> 02:18:33.896]  Reform your own heart first.
[02:18:34.486 --> 02:18:46.754]  And, you know, embrace Christ and the Holy Spirit will be indwelled in you and work through you to do good and to take this country back and to take our freedoms back because they're being stripped away.
[02:18:46.794 --> 02:18:50.157]  And, you know, again, I see the common trend here.
[02:18:50.337 --> 02:18:53.299]  The common trend is that they're coming after Christians.
[02:18:53.579 --> 02:18:58.262]  You know, I'm not allowed, Alex, to accept Visa or MasterCard, credit or debit cards for my business.
[02:18:58.940 --> 02:19:00.663]  I've been banned from multiple banks.
[02:19:00.783 --> 02:19:02.686]  I've been banned from multiple payment processors.
[02:19:03.007 --> 02:19:05.370]  I've been banned from hosting providers, from you name it.
[02:19:06.152 --> 02:19:08.676]  Have you reached out to Bongino's new thing?
[02:19:10.026 --> 02:19:11.107]  No, no, I haven't tried that.
[02:19:11.147 --> 02:19:13.008]  I did see that he started a payment processor.
[02:19:13.048 --> 02:19:14.790]  Well, we reached out to him before.
[02:19:14.830 --> 02:19:17.992]  He said a year ago, oh, my sponsors, they said, oh, we don't do business with you.
[02:19:18.412 --> 02:19:21.975]  So I'm not I'm not a guy that starts fights with folks, but we've reached out.
[02:19:21.995 --> 02:19:23.236]  We've given him all our banking stuff.
[02:19:23.276 --> 02:19:24.077]  We have perfect credit.
[02:19:24.637 --> 02:19:27.119]  If they don't do it for us, I'm going to go to war with Bongino.
[02:19:27.159 --> 02:19:29.281]  It's not a threat, but we put Bongino on the map.
[02:19:29.321 --> 02:19:30.161]  We like Bongino.
[02:19:30.522 --> 02:19:33.144]  He already, though, with his last sponsor, said no to us.
[02:19:33.564 --> 02:19:38.748]  So it's a big deal if he's running ads saying, oh, we'll take your payment processing, then he better do it.
[02:19:39.696 --> 02:19:46.017]  Yeah, maybe I should apply too and see what happens, although I highly doubt that he'll accept GAAP for payment processing.
[02:19:46.357 --> 02:19:47.278]  But that'll be interesting.
[02:19:47.618 --> 02:19:53.239]  On that note, you know, we're working on a solution to that ourselves called... Hey, the minute you got it, brother, I think that's the future.
[02:19:53.279 --> 02:19:54.139]  I'm not as technical as you.
[02:19:54.639 --> 02:19:55.019]  Exactly.
[02:19:55.099 --> 02:19:56.760]  What is the future of us?
[02:19:57.180 --> 02:19:58.540]  They're trying to put us in a gulag.
[02:19:58.860 --> 02:19:59.460]  We're smart.
[02:19:59.760 --> 02:20:03.041]  How do we, because the whole future is, how do we build something?
[02:20:03.641 --> 02:20:06.842]  That is the, conservatives, Christians would flock to that across the world.
[02:20:07.950 --> 02:20:09.511]  Yeah, I mean, we're working on that right now.
[02:20:09.531 --> 02:20:23.935]  So we're working on something called GAB Pay, which is essentially going to be the free speech PayPal, and we're going to allow people to sign up for a GAB Pay account, hook up their bank account, and then they can send money peer-to-peer between one another, you know, without financial censorship.
[02:20:24.196 --> 02:20:28.317]  As long as you're not doing anything illegal or breaking the law, you'll be allowed to use the service.
[02:20:28.957 --> 02:20:31.418]  This is something that is a tremendous choke point
[02:20:31.978 --> 02:20:32.738]  Thank you.
[02:20:49.721 --> 02:20:55.982]  I mean, what they have done to me, what they have done to you, what they're doing to Nick Fuentes right now, they're going to be doing to churches.
[02:20:56.062 --> 02:20:58.363]  They're going to be doing to Christian organizations.
[02:20:58.403 --> 02:21:05.024]  They're going to be doing to, you know, just people who refuse to toe the line of the American oligarch regime.
[02:21:05.444 --> 02:21:07.985]  So we need to prepare for that right now.
[02:21:08.325 --> 02:21:14.486]  And that's why, you know, I started Gab five years ago because I knew that this level of censorship that we're seeing would inevitably get here.
[02:21:14.846 --> 02:21:17.487]  And that's why now I'm seeing, you know, over the next five years,
[02:21:17.867 --> 02:21:26.736]  The financial part of this where, you know, people are getting banned from banks, people are getting banned from payment processors, they're not allowed to buy or sell, you know, that is where things are going next.
[02:21:26.796 --> 02:21:28.278]  That's where they're escalating things to.
[02:21:28.638 --> 02:21:32.902]  And not just for people like you or me, but for average, everyday, normal American people.
[02:21:33.283 --> 02:21:40.070]  So, you know, we need to build that infrastructure right now today, which is what we're working on in preparation for that, because that is where this is headed.
[02:21:41.483 --> 02:21:41.883]  I agree.
[02:21:41.983 --> 02:21:46.664]  Well, I really appreciate your time and the few minutes we have left here.
[02:21:46.804 --> 02:21:50.485]  What else do you want to impart to people, Mr. Torba, about Gab?
[02:21:50.525 --> 02:21:55.867]  Because I've seen this on Infowars.com and I've seen this in the comments.
[02:21:56.547 --> 02:21:58.388]  Listeners are like, why don't you promote Gab more?
[02:21:58.448 --> 02:22:01.788]  Why don't you on your show and your articles say, go to Gab?
[02:22:01.828 --> 02:22:02.429]  And I totally agree.
[02:22:02.449 --> 02:22:03.569]  I've told my writers to do it.
[02:22:03.929 --> 02:22:04.869]  I've told my crew to do it.
[02:22:05.709 --> 02:22:07.410]  We do post, you know, embedded
[02:22:08.717 --> 02:22:09.577]  Thanks for having me.
[02:22:34.502 --> 02:22:34.922]  Yeah, Alex.
[02:22:34.942 --> 02:22:38.004]  I mean, the first thing you can do is prayer is definitely number one.
[02:22:38.024 --> 02:22:42.747]  You know, it's really difficult on my family and on myself and on my team.
[02:22:43.327 --> 02:22:44.188]  What we do is not easy.
[02:22:44.228 --> 02:22:45.789]  We have a lot of long, grueling days.
[02:22:45.849 --> 02:22:47.250]  It's been a long five years.
[02:22:48.010 --> 02:22:51.032]  But, you know, that's the cross we carry to defend free speech online.
[02:22:51.332 --> 02:22:54.274]  What people should know about Gab.com is that we're the home of free speech.
[02:22:54.659 --> 02:22:57.221]  If it's protected by the First Amendment, it's protected on Gab.
[02:22:57.521 --> 02:22:59.182]  We don't allow any illegal activity.
[02:22:59.222 --> 02:23:00.603]  We don't allow threats of violence.
[02:23:00.703 --> 02:23:04.385]  And it's the Internet as it always has been since the inception of the Internet.
[02:23:04.405 --> 02:23:05.846]  It's the free flow of information.
[02:23:06.246 --> 02:23:07.147]  It's speak your mind.
[02:23:07.487 --> 02:23:10.089]  If you don't like what someone's saying, you don't have to associate with them.
[02:23:10.149 --> 02:23:11.389]  You can block or mute them.
[02:23:11.910 --> 02:23:12.930]  You don't have to follow them.
[02:23:13.271 --> 02:23:15.352]  So it's free association with free speech.
[02:23:15.512 --> 02:23:17.213]  And soon we're going to have a free market.
[02:23:17.573 --> 02:23:22.056]  We are the leading alternative to Silicon Valley oligarchies.
[02:23:22.418 --> 02:23:23.119]  Thank you so much.
[02:23:35.700 --> 02:23:36.060]  I don't know.
[02:23:56.897 --> 02:23:58.578]  I know a lot of this is stuff off records.
[02:23:58.599 --> 02:24:01.781]  They have you sign a non-disclosure, meet with a corporate group, they want to give you an offer.
[02:24:01.821 --> 02:24:03.202]  I've been through this probably 20 times.
[02:24:03.763 --> 02:24:05.584]  I haven't had these conversations with you, I'm just guessing.
[02:24:06.065 --> 02:24:13.952]  What is it like, though, when they're offering you that $20 million, that $50 million, that $100 million, which I've been offered to sell out?
[02:24:13.972 --> 02:24:15.193]  Because for me it's so easy.
[02:24:17.034 --> 02:24:25.920]  Entertaining the offer I feel God pulling away from me and that that is so scary that Like fear of God is not fear that God's gonna hurt you.
[02:24:26.241 --> 02:24:29.103]  It's fear of separation So I'm sitting there anytime.
[02:24:29.183 --> 02:24:38.769]  I'm not gonna sell out, but I'll look at their deal and I literally feel like God going So I'm not putting words in your mouth that's my experience what's your experience?
[02:24:39.650 --> 02:24:43.973]  absolutely, yeah, you know I've had hedge fund managers and venture capitalists and
[02:24:44.332 --> 02:24:49.236]  You know, big corporations will approach us with all sorts of deals and offers and they always come with strings.
[02:24:49.936 --> 02:24:52.098]  But, you know, I'm not doing this for money, Alex.
[02:24:52.238 --> 02:25:00.665]  I'm doing this so that my children have a place where they can speak freely on the Internet so that they can have the same Internet that I grew up with.
[02:25:01.004 --> 02:25:06.791]  And so that the millions of people that depend on Gab to get their access to information... Because if you don't have speech, you have nothing.
[02:25:06.891 --> 02:25:13.599]  And I know you don't want to give the enemy attention, but people need to know how real this is that they come to you and they say, oh yeah, we want to fund you, do whatever you want.
[02:25:13.719 --> 02:25:14.941]  Oh, here's the contract.
[02:25:15.241 --> 02:25:16.142]  Just agree to these things.
[02:25:16.583 --> 02:25:16.763]  Right?
[02:25:16.803 --> 02:25:17.864]  Like they lie up front, right?
[02:25:18.085 --> 02:25:20.568]  They say, oh, there's no restriction until the contract comes out.
[02:25:21.519 --> 02:25:21.739]  Right.
[02:25:22.199 --> 02:25:24.560]  Or even after a lot of cases, they'll do that too.
[02:25:25.040 --> 02:25:29.442]  They'll get you the money, they'll get you in the door, and then they'll try to subvert you after that.
[02:25:29.482 --> 02:25:31.423]  But the moment you give them an inch, it's over.
[02:25:31.783 --> 02:25:32.183]  It's over.
[02:25:32.643 --> 02:25:38.725]  The moment that you sell your soul out for capital or for power or for status, they offer all sorts of things.
[02:25:38.785 --> 02:25:44.207]  And when that didn't work, they tried that very early on with me in 2016, 2017 when we first launched Gab.
[02:25:44.647 --> 02:25:46.888]  When that didn't work, that's when the attacks began.
[02:25:47.318 --> 02:25:51.780]  That's when they started coming after me personally, coming after my family, coming after the business.
[02:25:51.940 --> 02:25:56.123]  You know, we started getting banned from app stores and payment processors and you name it.
[02:25:56.243 --> 02:26:00.605]  And each and every time we just got more and more resilient and more and more bold.
[02:26:01.405 --> 02:26:06.188]  You know, if you tell me I can't do something, that means that I'm going to work twice as hard.
[02:26:06.624 --> 02:26:10.668]  And what is it like spiritually and psychically to feel all these brown people and white people and black people?
[02:26:27.091 --> 02:26:30.852]  Red-blooded people, you can feel their love and their will and they support you.
[02:26:31.213 --> 02:26:32.513]  Not just financially, their prayers.
[02:26:33.133 --> 02:26:37.975]  Sometimes I'm so exhausted and all of a sudden it's like just, they just give me all that power.
[02:26:38.015 --> 02:26:38.836]  I'm so thankful.
[02:26:39.256 --> 02:26:40.456]  It's that communal power.
[02:26:40.476 --> 02:26:41.216]  This is spiritual.
[02:26:42.277 --> 02:26:45.198]  You know, we get letters to our PO Box every day, handwritten letters.
[02:26:45.458 --> 02:26:50.540]  And, you know, we get emails and I get comments on, you know, hundreds of thousands of comments a week on my posts.
[02:26:51.367 --> 02:27:01.290]  With people from all around the world from all different backgrounds all different races religions beliefs and creeds Saying keep going and some days, you know that are tough.
[02:27:02.230 --> 02:27:15.254]  I just needed that letter I needed to read that letter and I feel like that's that's the Holy Spirit You know working through these folks to get to me to give me that that little boost that I need because this is hard Alex You know, I don't have to tell you this is hard on the soul.
[02:27:15.354 --> 02:27:16.254]  It's it's hard on a man
[02:27:16.993 --> 02:27:22.015]  Especially when you have a young family and you know what these people are capable of.
[02:27:22.695 --> 02:27:29.257]  But, you know, there's something in me that the Holy Spirit just whispers in the back of my mind and says, keep going, keep building, you can do this.
[02:27:29.797 --> 02:27:33.039]  And that's what gets me going every day, is the people around us.
[02:27:33.779 --> 02:27:40.081]  My family have a really solid support system and the great people, the many millions of people on GAB that support us.
[02:27:41.348 --> 02:27:48.890]  And it's that long arc of humanity and all our ancestors behind us that is so powerful and so amazing.
[02:27:48.930 --> 02:27:57.092]  So tell us, everybody watching, all these great activists, they need to go to Gab, they need to, how do they promote what you're doing?
[02:27:57.512 --> 02:28:00.533]  They get there, they post, they promote it, they tell folks about it.
[02:28:00.553 --> 02:28:06.114]  I mean, I can't wait for your success, which is already amazing, but I want to just get behind everything you're doing, Andrew.
[02:28:07.335 --> 02:28:10.897]  Yeah, just go to gab.com, sign up, create an account, tell your friends and family.
[02:28:10.957 --> 02:28:14.439]  I mean, the way that we grow 100% of our growth is through word of mouth.
[02:28:14.539 --> 02:28:18.541]  So, you know, we're growing, you know, just through people telling their friends and family.
[02:28:18.561 --> 02:28:27.126]  So that's the best way is get on the site, stop making money for these enemy platforms, allowing them to track you all across the web and siphon your data off to
[02:28:27.846 --> 02:28:29.587]  You know the big corporations who hate you?
[02:28:30.308 --> 02:28:36.072]  You know that's the best way you can do it is tell people about us and get on there yourself and stop using these enemy platforms.
[02:28:57.906 --> 02:29:04.309]  Now, like we were down at the border and we didn't know where Trump was going to show up or where he'd be.
[02:29:04.809 --> 02:29:05.509]  It didn't really matter.
[02:29:05.569 --> 02:29:11.112]  And I sat there and I sat there in a truck 30 miles away and I said, get in the car now, drive here, Trump will be there.
[02:29:11.452 --> 02:29:14.453]  We drove in the middle of nowhere, Trump showed up exactly as I said right on time.
[02:29:15.173 --> 02:29:17.674]  And like the crew was kind of like, okay, that's, that's something interesting.
[02:29:18.035 --> 02:29:21.076]  But I did not have that power 10 years ago or even five years ago.
[02:29:21.636 --> 02:29:23.378]  And I don't say that to impress people, folks.
[02:29:23.418 --> 02:29:24.879]  This is powerful.
[02:29:25.319 --> 02:29:27.081]  I mean, God is powerful.
[02:29:27.301 --> 02:29:28.702]  The Satanists are looking for power.
[02:29:29.002 --> 02:29:33.846]  When I am purely just trying to be good, I don't even know how it works.
[02:29:33.986 --> 02:29:35.348]  It's insane.
[02:29:35.648 --> 02:29:36.889]  It is unbelievable.
[02:29:37.830 --> 02:29:39.771]  The Holy Spirit is the ether.
[02:29:39.831 --> 02:29:44.896]  It's like God's consciousness, and we're like jacking into God's internet.
[02:29:44.996 --> 02:29:46.317]  I don't know how to describe it.
[02:29:46.377 --> 02:29:47.558]  Is that what you're saying you're feeling?
[02:29:48.513 --> 02:29:49.634]  Yeah, oh, absolutely.
[02:29:49.694 --> 02:29:51.455]  That's a great way to describe it.
[02:29:51.495 --> 02:30:00.741]  I mean, I was very blessed to be saved at a young age, but like many young Christians, I drifted from God in my teenage years and in college.
[02:30:00.821 --> 02:30:06.125]  But thankfully, through Gab, actually, I ended up getting closer and closer to God.
[02:30:06.425 --> 02:30:16.031]  The persecution that I faced, the no-platforming, the defaming, having you and they had my— Saying you're a murderer, saying you murdered people.
[02:30:17.782 --> 02:30:21.984]  Yeah, all that stuff, you know, drove me closer to Christ and into the arms of Christ.
[02:30:22.064 --> 02:30:37.693]  And, you know, the more that I embraced Christ and started getting more involved with my church and, you know, opening up the Bible and praying and, you know, openly proclaiming my faith, the more that, you know, that the Holy Spirit started to, you know, work in me.
[02:30:37.994 --> 02:30:39.875]  And it's really daunting, Alex.
[02:30:39.915 --> 02:30:45.238]  I say to my wife the other night, I said, you know, I really do feel like when you feel
[02:30:45.658 --> 02:30:51.099]  The presence of God, it's so terrifying and so glorifying at the same time.
[02:30:51.159 --> 02:30:53.100]  It's like a bittersweet thing, right?
[02:30:53.160 --> 02:30:57.001]  It's like, this is incredible, but this is also incredibly terrifying, right?
[02:30:57.341 --> 02:31:06.163]  So, when you sense the presence of God in you and working through you, it's very humbling and it brings you back down to earth.
[02:31:06.981 --> 02:31:19.224]  And thankfully, you know, I have my family I have the support system that I have and I have my faith to keep me grounded and keep me humble Because pride cometh before the fall and that's it's very easy to be prideful in our situation, right?
[02:31:19.264 --> 02:31:34.428]  Like oh we have all these these fans and all these viewers and all these these people that are on my site It's very easy to get a big head But I know that in an instant if God wanted to he could take that all away And that would be fine if that's what he wanted if that's what his will is I have fully submitted my life to Christ and I
[02:31:34.788 --> 02:31:36.791]  Once you do that, that is what true freedom is.
[02:31:36.851 --> 02:31:43.059]  When you fully submit to the will of God, that is what true freedom is in this life, and I firmly believe that.
[02:31:43.780 --> 02:31:44.281]  Exactly.
[02:31:44.381 --> 02:31:45.883]  Submission to Satan is slavery.
[02:31:46.224 --> 02:31:49.067]  Submission to God is internal empowerment.
[02:31:49.958 --> 02:32:03.905]  It is just, you just gotta make that, and that makes me sad for my enemies, because as bad as they are, as much as I don't like them, more and more I'm like, I cannot believe they don't know what God is all about, and I don't know how, how they're not connected to this.
[02:32:04.406 --> 02:32:07.207]  Because the deeper you get into God, it's incredible!
[02:32:07.287 --> 02:32:10.589]  I mean, now, I don't even know how to respond to this.
[02:32:10.689 --> 02:32:12.390]  I mean, the sermon I'm giving now is like,
[02:32:13.479 --> 02:32:16.860]  Like weaponize hieroglyphs, like everything.
[02:32:17.200 --> 02:32:20.721]  And it's like, I know now like math instantly and like all sorts of things.
[02:32:20.761 --> 02:32:21.801]  It's like, it's crazy.
[02:32:22.161 --> 02:32:23.702]  And I'm this pathetic vessel.
[02:32:23.962 --> 02:32:25.062]  It's not me exactly.
[02:32:25.402 --> 02:32:27.963]  It's a charge going through me, Andrew.
[02:32:27.983 --> 02:32:29.924]  And God is with you, my friend.
[02:32:30.344 --> 02:32:31.024]  God bless you.
[02:32:31.464 --> 02:32:35.245]  Again, everybody should go now, set up an account, support others, promote it.
[02:32:35.865 --> 02:32:38.306]  They are definitely afraid of you and we love you, brother.
[02:32:39.602 --> 02:32:40.342]  God bless Alex.
[02:32:40.362 --> 02:32:41.923]  All right, there goes Andrew Torba.
[02:32:42.284 --> 02:32:44.145]  Gab, I apologize for getting him on late.
[02:32:44.605 --> 02:32:46.666]  We had a big interview with Malice that you just saw.
[02:32:47.326 --> 02:32:48.727]  Wow, that is powerful.
[02:32:49.528 --> 02:32:50.908]  It's totally real too, folks.
[02:32:51.088 --> 02:32:56.612]  I have seen, I told you, I, uh, I got depressed and call it that like six, eight months ago.
[02:32:57.172 --> 02:33:03.696]  And I, before I went to bed at night, I got on my knees and I said, God, I know you're real and you've done so much, but I hurt.
[02:33:03.896 --> 02:33:06.017]  And I said, I don't want to hurt anymore.
[02:33:08.038 --> 02:33:09.919]  I don't like seeing these people that do bad.
[02:33:12.761 --> 02:33:13.801]  I said, please help me.
[02:33:13.821 --> 02:33:19.564]  I had a dream that night.
[02:33:20.505 --> 02:33:21.225]  And it wasn't a dream.
[02:33:22.005 --> 02:33:23.166]  It was literally the Golden Gates.
[02:33:23.946 --> 02:33:24.467]  It was heaven.
[02:33:24.487 --> 02:33:25.947]  It was everything you've ever heard of.
[02:33:26.027 --> 02:33:27.408]  And it was so incredible.
[02:33:27.828 --> 02:33:34.652]  Like every spark, every image, everything I saw was so beautiful and perfect and forever.
[02:33:35.032 --> 02:33:36.333]  And it was total completion.
[02:33:37.093 --> 02:33:41.595]  Total victory at every level of my very soul.
[02:33:42.075 --> 02:33:47.397]  It was like drowning in the ocean and finally getting tossed up on shore and you can just rest.
[02:33:47.497 --> 02:33:49.898]  It was just, it's just rest of these arms.
[02:33:50.758 --> 02:33:53.159]  Just come here forever.
[02:33:56.501 --> 02:33:57.341]  You have free will.
[02:33:58.061 --> 02:33:59.022]  You made the right choice.
[02:33:59.902 --> 02:34:01.403]  Now we're together forever.
[02:34:03.343 --> 02:34:04.724]  And all the sin was washed away.
[02:34:06.249 --> 02:34:13.715]  As I came out of that ocean, onto that beach, and I looked at it, and I said, I want to see how this works.
[02:34:14.655 --> 02:34:15.636]  Go ahead and look at it any way you want.
[02:34:16.377 --> 02:34:28.185]  And I looked into all of the different civilizations and groups and species that were destroyed, and God said it doesn't matter, that's their free will.
[02:34:29.326 --> 02:34:29.927]  And that's true.
[02:34:31.007 --> 02:34:32.569]  All that matters is your choice now.
[02:34:33.578 --> 02:34:39.861]  Because if there is a sentient, all-powerful being that can give you unlimited consciousness, what is the one pitfall?
[02:34:39.941 --> 02:34:40.441]  It's free will.
[02:34:41.361 --> 02:34:54.007]  You can be tricked like the gay, satanic orchestra or choir in San Francisco, and you look at those people and they're just... I had Michael Malice on earlier.
[02:34:54.347 --> 02:34:57.048]  He didn't even want to talk about that because they were so mentally ill.
[02:34:59.049 --> 02:34:59.649]  And I get that.
[02:35:01.101 --> 02:35:01.721]  Let's go to break.
[02:35:02.001 --> 02:35:03.061]  Let's get the next guest on.
[02:35:03.121 --> 02:35:07.142]  I had him on with Thomas in Florida about their endgame.
[02:35:07.162 --> 02:35:08.463]  The hell they're building for us.
[02:35:08.843 --> 02:35:12.364]  The prison they're building for us that they say is Valhalla.
[02:35:13.384 --> 02:35:14.344]  But it's the opposite of that.
[02:35:14.364 --> 02:35:17.445]  Because you don't get into Valhalla without fighting.
[02:35:18.445 --> 02:35:19.305]  Fighting for what's right.
[02:35:20.666 --> 02:35:21.266]  We'll be right back.
[02:35:21.286 --> 02:35:21.666]  Stay with us.
[02:35:26.434 --> 02:35:27.414]  I'm at war with tyranny.
[02:35:28.275 --> 02:35:29.995]  But it doesn't mean that I have all the answers.
[02:35:30.015 --> 02:35:32.356]  It doesn't mean that I figured out every way to defeat them.
[02:35:32.636 --> 02:35:33.216]  But I know this.
[02:35:34.096 --> 02:35:47.320]  If we reduce our signature, if we take these cell phones that have all these great attributes and all these great services, but also track, trace, and spy on us, and if we lock them up in a little Faraday cage, like the little devils they are,
[02:35:48.220 --> 02:35:49.241]  They can't track us.
[02:35:49.281 --> 02:35:50.201]  They can't trace us.
[02:35:50.542 --> 02:36:00.008]  They can't use that data against us for contact tracers, the UN, Joe Biden's people coming to your doors, but also hackers and regular criminals.
[02:36:00.548 --> 02:36:02.309]  So what I do, and I've got a black one.
[02:36:02.329 --> 02:36:02.910]  I've got a red one.
[02:36:02.930 --> 02:36:03.770]  I also have it in blue.
[02:36:04.351 --> 02:36:06.632]  I put my little devilish cell phone in it.
[02:36:07.073 --> 02:36:11.255]  And it also reminds me of how powerful the phone is and how it's surveilling me.
[02:36:11.295 --> 02:36:15.959]  And it makes me reduce my phone time and spend more time with my family.
[02:36:16.379 --> 02:36:17.420]  So when I'm driving in a car.
[02:36:18.500 --> 02:36:28.528]  Or, when I'm going to church, or when I'm at the grocery store, or when I'm not going to use this thing, or I go to bed at night, I remind myself it's a two-edged sword, and I put it right inside this container.
[02:36:28.588 --> 02:36:31.050]  Now, we've been sold out of these for months.
[02:36:31.977 --> 02:36:34.779]  Because of the supply chain breakdowns with the fake COVID lockdowns.
[02:36:34.799 --> 02:36:39.161]  But finally, we got in some big shipments of these babies.
[02:36:39.722 --> 02:36:42.543]  And so I want to encourage you to take action and get off the fence and get them.
[02:36:43.164 --> 02:36:52.129]  Normally we sell them at $19.95, which is massively discounted from $29.95 that this exact same high quality Faraday cage sells all day long.
[02:36:52.549 --> 02:37:01.077]  We're selling it for the first time, 50% off, $14.95, at InfoWarsHaw.com in four colors, black, red, blue, and green.
[02:37:01.578 --> 02:37:03.760]  We've got a bunch of black, a bunch of red, a bunch of blue.
[02:37:03.820 --> 02:37:05.041]  The green is almost sold out.
[02:37:05.501 --> 02:37:06.402]  They're $14.95.
[02:37:06.983 --> 02:37:09.485]  They're a great gift for friends and family.
[02:37:09.745 --> 02:37:11.107]  They're a great conversation piece.
[02:37:11.467 --> 02:37:15.351]  They're all available, massively discounted, at InfoWarsHaw.com.
[02:37:15.811 --> 02:37:19.493]  Let's start taking back control of our lives by becoming conscious.
[02:37:19.833 --> 02:37:24.616]  Let's put these little devilish spy systems in a cage, except when we decide to use them.
[02:37:26.217 --> 02:37:28.258]  I never had a marketing plan for InfoWars.
[02:37:28.698 --> 02:37:32.661]  I went out and found the best products I could find from the research to fund our operation.
[02:37:32.961 --> 02:37:37.503]  I wanted you to get products that empowered you, that you loved, so you'd want to come back and buy more.
[02:37:37.643 --> 02:37:39.044]  I treat you like I want to be treated.
[02:37:39.204 --> 02:37:40.125]  It's very, very simple.
[02:37:40.205 --> 02:37:40.905]  It's instinctive.
[02:37:41.205 --> 02:37:41.746]  It's spiritual.
[02:37:41.786 --> 02:37:42.286]  It's what I do.
[02:37:42.546 --> 02:37:45.789]  And that said, our iodine products have become our best sellers.
[02:37:45.969 --> 02:37:52.895]  And X2 right now is discounted because listeners and viewers are habituated to only buy it when it's on sale.
[02:37:53.476 --> 02:37:54.136]  And so I'm in a catch-22.
[02:37:54.156 --> 02:37:56.638]  When I don't have it on sale, I don't sell it.
[02:37:56.919 --> 02:38:01.162]  But we're selling out of all our other products because of supply chain breakdowns, and so I'm in a catch-22.
[02:38:01.823 --> 02:38:03.825]  I need to sell products at full price, but I can't.
[02:38:03.845 --> 02:38:05.186]  I've got to sell them at discount.
[02:38:05.646 --> 02:38:06.887]  And so, it's discounted.
[02:38:06.907 --> 02:38:11.969]  40% off for the dropper bottle, 60% off for the spray bottle, even though it's about to sell out.
[02:38:12.289 --> 02:38:13.449]  It won't be available for months.
[02:38:13.890 --> 02:38:14.410]  So get it.
[02:38:14.890 --> 02:38:21.253]  X2 is selling out at InfoWareStore.com for 40 and 60% off with double Patreon points and free shipping.
[02:38:21.493 --> 02:38:22.073]  Because why?
[02:38:22.453 --> 02:38:23.214]  That's when you buy it.
[02:38:23.474 --> 02:38:24.974]  We need your funds or we'll be off air.
[02:38:24.995 --> 02:38:25.875]  It's an amazing product.
[02:38:26.235 --> 02:38:26.575]  All right.
[02:38:26.675 --> 02:38:30.378]  So we just did that extremely powerful interview with Andrew Torba.
[02:38:30.699 --> 02:38:32.940]  And listen, I get tears in my eyes.
[02:38:32.980 --> 02:38:34.301]  The liberals make jokes about it.
[02:38:34.361 --> 02:38:44.169]  They think it's funny that when I'm talking to somebody who's been persecuted and I'm talking to somebody reaching millions of people every day who's standing up and been through the crucible, I admire that person.
[02:38:44.629 --> 02:38:46.371]  I don't give a damn about football stars.
[02:38:46.471 --> 02:38:47.772]  I don't care about Hollywood people.
[02:38:48.152 --> 02:38:49.213]  I don't care about any of it.
[02:38:49.333 --> 02:38:54.517]  I care about people that stand up for humanity and I'm ready to go to war for them.
[02:38:54.617 --> 02:38:55.638]  I have gone to war for them.
[02:38:56.561 --> 02:39:01.603]  And I committed everything to this and I believe in you and my ancestors, they believed in us.
[02:39:03.163 --> 02:39:05.784]  And so I intend to be an example to my future progeny.
[02:39:06.005 --> 02:39:07.005]  We're going to win this damn thing.
[02:39:07.025 --> 02:39:10.506]  We're going to have some big problems to fix out in the future.
[02:39:10.526 --> 02:39:13.767]  We're going to look back on these fights like a cakewalk.
[02:39:15.888 --> 02:39:21.210]  But let it be said, I believe the integrity of our species and to follow the design that our maker gave us.
[02:39:21.690 --> 02:39:22.951]  And I'm following those directives.
[02:39:24.705 --> 02:39:26.867]  Sin is going against the directive of the Creator.
[02:39:27.147 --> 02:39:28.168]  We have the free will to do it.
[02:39:29.089 --> 02:39:34.794]  I've dabbled in plenty of it, and I can just tell you right now, I'm born again hard in the name of Jesus Christ.
[02:39:36.115 --> 02:39:40.519]  And you're not gonna find Jesus in the churches, because the devil puts his people in all the positions.
[02:39:40.879 --> 02:39:43.721]  You're gonna find Jesus at 2 a.m., praying on your knees.
[02:39:43.942 --> 02:39:44.242]  All right!
[02:39:45.814 --> 02:39:55.544]  That said, let's bring Thomas from Florida on, who I had on Thursday, who's a smart guy and he sent us this big old stack of stuff he's going to talk about.
[02:39:56.685 --> 02:39:59.227]  The plan to get you out of your body.
[02:39:59.247 --> 02:40:01.910]  And it's funny, Greg Reese missed him on Thursday.
[02:40:02.731 --> 02:40:09.518]  Greg Reese, the huntsman, is already on the same track as this.
[02:40:10.256 --> 02:40:11.717]  So that's how the Zeitgeist works.
[02:40:11.737 --> 02:40:13.618]  We're all in the Zeitgeist.
[02:40:14.238 --> 02:40:16.179]  The enemy has their spirit, we've got ours.
[02:40:16.839 --> 02:40:23.302]  So we're going to talk about this right now, with him, on this Saturday, Global Transmission.
[02:40:24.082 --> 02:40:26.424]  So start at the beginning, boil it down.
[02:40:26.444 --> 02:40:32.728]  I know you told the producer, the guy running the show, oh my God, Alex, if I start talking, I'll never shut up, brothers.
[02:40:33.488 --> 02:40:40.773]  So my friend, start with the basic premise and then lay this out for us in the next 20, 30 minutes here.
[02:40:40.793 --> 02:40:41.434]  You got the floor.
[02:40:41.734 --> 02:40:42.434]  Thanks for joining us.
[02:40:44.235 --> 02:40:46.357]  Thank you very much for inviting me back again, Mr. Jones.
[02:40:46.717 --> 02:40:53.642]  The essential essence of the topic is the term human digital twins.
[02:40:54.700 --> 02:40:59.823]  and whether or not they can actually be separated from their creators.
[02:41:00.484 --> 02:41:21.677]  So it's quite an existential question and in these very very challenging times it seems to be relevant because we're looking increasingly at why are ostensibly crazy or evil things happening and what will the next steps be so people can be forewarned.
[02:41:22.758 --> 02:41:23.859]  And in this situation
[02:41:24.989 --> 02:41:50.772]  We've had several governmental bodies, some of them think tanks and some of them executive organs of groups as large as the European Union, starting to use this phrase in the last 18 months, so basically since the beginning of Covid, which may be a coincidence or people might infer otherwise, about the nature of
[02:41:51.897 --> 02:42:02.244]  human digital twins and in particular whether or not they can be valuable after their creation and whether or not they can be traded.
[02:42:03.705 --> 02:42:17.513]  So if we were briefly to consider what is a digital twin in the context of how that industrial term came about initially about 12 years ago.
[02:42:17.534 --> 02:42:17.574]  In 2009
[02:42:20.367 --> 02:42:39.818]  NASA adopted that term when they were looking for ways to describe computer-assisted spacecraft design, where they wanted to be able to simulate it against all types of conditions without having the entire test through in space, which obviously makes a lot of sensors a lot cheaper.
[02:42:40.638 --> 02:42:48.563]  It was then very, very quickly extended to an organization called the Digital Twin Consortium.
[02:42:49.312 --> 02:42:56.235]  that is a member of a rather curious group called the Object Management Group.
[02:42:56.856 --> 02:43:02.358]  We, funnily enough, have a conference about space occurring in about three weeks time.
[02:43:03.119 --> 02:43:18.346]  And for them, a digital twin is a dynamic, up-to-date representation of a physical object or system with a complete collection of all data in one place.
[02:43:19.358 --> 02:43:27.701]  And a digital twin evolves with the flow of real-time data input from sensors and other monitoring devices.
[02:43:28.461 --> 02:43:43.145]  And this connection between the digital and physical worlds offers enhanced life cycles, informed decision-making, and most importantly, it offers predictive capabilities.
[02:43:43.406 --> 02:43:43.686]  That's right.
[02:43:43.706 --> 02:43:47.687]  They're using us to build the AI for autonomous drones and beyond.
[02:43:49.124 --> 02:43:51.026]  Well, it's not just autonomous drones.
[02:43:51.526 --> 02:43:56.231]  What this is, is essentially a copy of yourself in all regards.
[02:43:56.791 --> 02:44:07.781]  So you've had all these digital catchphrases that have been thrown around by people such as Thierry Britton, the European Union Commissioner for Digital Services.
[02:44:08.622 --> 02:44:09.723]  And he said,
[02:44:12.057 --> 02:44:19.419]  A new digital ID will give every European citizen the keys to their digital twin.
[02:44:20.860 --> 02:44:34.985]  But it's my supposition, and I think there's plenty of documentation to support this, that unfortunately you're, or whatever citizen you may be, is not going to be the only person in control of a set of keys.
[02:44:35.565 --> 02:44:39.106]  So just as if you're renting a house, maybe the realtor
[02:44:39.711 --> 02:44:44.072]  And the actual building owner also have sets of... Exactly.
[02:44:44.092 --> 02:44:45.372]  They're going to rent your thoughts.
[02:44:45.392 --> 02:44:46.673]  They're going to rent Brad Pitt.
[02:44:47.613 --> 02:44:48.293]  Yes, indeed.
[02:44:48.553 --> 02:44:49.093]  Yes, indeed.
[02:44:49.674 --> 02:45:05.357]  And so we get to a situation of how are they actually going to go about doing this and whether or not you think that it's far smart dust or whether or not you think that there was an injectable chip with the vaccines or whether or not there might be in the future.
[02:45:06.258 --> 02:45:07.578]  At some point,
[02:45:08.237 --> 02:45:19.362]  We're looking at an addition of your internal bodily information combined with your... This is a digital DNA being instructed off of your actions.
[02:45:21.383 --> 02:45:22.543]  Well, it's more than that.
[02:45:22.663 --> 02:45:24.624]  It's all of your past history as well.
[02:45:25.204 --> 02:45:34.788]  So the idea of the digital wallet, and you actually discovered the tip of this iceberg when you yourself were reporting on homeless people being offered $100 to be chipped
[02:45:37.555 --> 02:45:37.675]  In
[02:45:53.919 --> 02:46:00.501]  Well, it was quite extraordinary because I ended up speaking with your son by chance when I did another call-in with Harrison Smith.
[02:46:23.652 --> 02:46:27.513]  And he said, do you have any documentation for this?
[02:46:27.633 --> 02:46:45.497]  Because as he told the story when he was younger, because this was three years ago and he was still in high school, he got a lot of flack from his high school classmates about not being able to document your ostensibly quite fantastical story.
[02:46:46.578 --> 02:46:52.459]  And so I sent Mr. Smith and your son all of the documents relating to the Austin
[02:46:53.044 --> 02:47:15.675]  My past program, the official announcements from the UN that Austin City was going to be a partner, which came out in May of 2018, and also an interview that was conducted at the award ceremony for the Austin government employee who actually received a Computing and Information Technology Award.
[02:47:15.795 --> 02:47:16.255]  Amazing!
[02:47:16.295 --> 02:47:17.295]  I never even knew this happened.
[02:47:17.315 --> 02:47:18.156]  Wow, this is incredible.
[02:47:19.236 --> 02:47:22.738]  Yeah, so it's complete and it wasn't just them.
[02:47:23.413 --> 02:47:26.193]  It appeared that they were trying to do something in San Francisco.
[02:47:26.654 --> 02:47:29.454]  They definitely did something in Bangladesh.
[02:47:30.034 --> 02:47:33.195]  And they also did something in a refugee center in Thailand.
[02:47:33.615 --> 02:47:34.895]  All at the same time.
[02:47:35.535 --> 02:47:38.716]  And there were different rationales in each country.
[02:47:38.916 --> 02:47:44.017]  And by the way, Klaus Schwab is on French TV saying the UN is going to put a microchip in him.
[02:47:45.137 --> 02:47:52.078]  Well, he was saying in that interview in 2016 that initially it would be in your clothes.
[02:47:52.534 --> 02:48:04.200]  Which is what we're seeing now with exactly with the Amazon Halo project and also the Intel make it wearable challenge.
[02:48:05.921 --> 02:48:18.768]  So for the first step that he was talking about in 2016 is being done or has been done over the last couple of years and we're seeing it commercialized right now.
[02:48:19.469 --> 02:48:22.050]  And then in that interview he said the next step
[02:48:22.688 --> 02:48:24.128]  So he's literally announcing revelation?
[02:48:51.701 --> 02:49:01.784]  The Palm Pay installs, they're starting to put the new systems in to get you used to swiping your palm to make payments.
[02:49:02.385 --> 02:49:05.706]  It's just like the touch and go system with the credit cards.
[02:49:06.026 --> 02:49:07.727]  Now you don't have a credit card to hold on to.
[02:49:08.387 --> 02:49:17.690]  They say that they're going to scan your palm print and they claim that that's a unique identifying feature, which seems a bit strange because you could be, you know,
[02:49:18.243 --> 02:49:27.829]  Wearing a glove or you might have burnt your hand or you could have a cut on your hand or something of that nature that would render the system not very easy to fulfill a transaction.
[02:49:28.430 --> 02:49:35.855]  But of course, it's getting you used to putting your palm face down in this code reading system.
[02:49:36.360 --> 02:49:36.540]  That's
[02:50:06.869 --> 02:50:07.749]  It was your criminal record.
[02:50:08.049 --> 02:50:09.510]  It was your educational record.
[02:50:09.530 --> 02:50:10.930]  It was a library card.
[02:50:11.130 --> 02:50:12.891]  It was all your financial history.
[02:50:13.331 --> 02:50:14.991]  It was all your medical history.
[02:50:15.131 --> 02:50:16.172]  It was your birth certificate.
[02:50:16.492 --> 02:50:17.712]  It was your driver's license.
[02:50:17.752 --> 02:50:19.352]  It was your social security records.
[02:50:19.853 --> 02:50:24.834]  All of that was essentially what they call the digital wallet.
[02:50:25.574 --> 02:50:35.877]  And the benefit and the reason they were piloting it in Austin and San Francisco, which were two cities that had very large homeless populations,
[02:50:36.997 --> 02:50:57.552]  And so not only were they susceptible to a cheap financial incentive, but in that environment, as opposed to the different reasons they had in Bangladesh and in Thailand, was that, oh, if you're homeless, particularly if you have mental health problems or addiction problems, you might literally lose your wallet.
[02:50:58.132 --> 02:51:03.115]  And therefore, if everything is on a digital backup, it will be really convenient for you.
[02:51:03.496 --> 02:51:06.578]  And that was how they were marketing it officially.
[02:51:07.576 --> 02:51:08.076]  In Austin.
[02:51:08.397 --> 02:51:09.877]  There was a different reason in Thailand.
[02:51:09.937 --> 02:51:11.838]  It was, we're in a refugee camp.
[02:51:12.138 --> 02:51:14.339]  You've had to flee with the clothes on your back.
[02:51:14.819 --> 02:51:18.281]  You've lost everything in various civil wars.
[02:51:18.841 --> 02:51:28.905]  And so this will be very helpful to you because if you ever have to cross borders under emergency circumstances, there'll be a tap into this system and find your entire history.
[02:51:29.205 --> 02:51:32.667]  So that'd be very good for identity verification.
[02:51:34.204 --> 02:51:37.306]  And Thomas, you're doing great.
[02:51:37.326 --> 02:51:38.687]  Just back off your mic a little bit.
[02:51:40.347 --> 02:52:00.157]  So the third scenario for Bangladesh, which was then also tested in India, and in India has been rolled out very extensively in three key databases, was many people in those largely rural countries were being born in villages, not hospitals.
[02:52:00.277 --> 02:52:01.378]  They would have home births.
[02:52:02.170 --> 02:52:04.432]  And they wouldn't get a birth certificate.
[02:52:04.912 --> 02:52:10.838]  And that then became very problematic for them to get a bank account or to apply for university or to get a passport.
[02:52:11.538 --> 02:52:18.684]  So they had a different excuse for different types of countries and different types of social situations.
[02:52:19.105 --> 02:52:22.227]  But the idea was to make it applicable to everyone.
[02:52:22.628 --> 02:52:24.970]  And that's why they had to have a variety of excuses.
[02:52:25.390 --> 02:52:29.934]  So all of that information essentially forms the skeleton
[02:52:31.018 --> 02:52:41.825]  But by then having what they call MEMS, which is the Miniaturized Electromagnetic Sensors.
[02:52:41.965 --> 02:52:43.486]  There's an industry term for it.
[02:52:43.627 --> 02:52:44.387]  It's MEMS.
[02:52:44.988 --> 02:52:46.188]  M-E-M-S.
[02:52:46.789 --> 02:52:47.789]  And people can look that up.
[02:52:47.809 --> 02:52:50.191]  There's lots and lots of scientific conversation about that.
[02:52:50.952 --> 02:53:00.258]  And they had two twin programs, one of which was receiving financial assistance initially from the National Science Foundation and also Obama's
[02:53:01.016 --> 02:53:06.979]  And these were both to make miniaturized implantable sensors.
[02:53:32.389 --> 02:53:42.017]  And by the way, Thomas, again, I'm going to give you the floor for the next 20 minutes.
[02:53:42.878 --> 02:53:43.799]  I want you to walk through this.
[02:53:43.919 --> 02:53:45.700]  Everything you're saying, you sent us the articles.
[02:53:46.121 --> 02:53:47.662]  I've done the research before you even came on.
[02:53:47.882 --> 02:53:48.723]  What you're saying is true.
[02:53:49.163 --> 02:53:50.044]  This is so incredible.
[02:53:50.064 --> 02:53:54.148]  I want you to walk through what they're doing and the whole endgame of this system.
[02:53:55.791 --> 02:54:16.626]  If people wish to look at some of these articles and verify the story for themselves, one journalist who's been following the development of the smart dust, which when you talk to many liberals they think is an urban myth, it's like a boogeyman, but Mr Bernard Marr
[02:54:17.932 --> 02:54:42.710]  M-A-R-R, writing for Forbes magazine at Forbes.com, has actually been covering the incredible technological process and steps in miniaturization and broadcasting strength that this special team of researchers at UC Berkeley have made over the last
[02:54:43.755 --> 02:54:44.415]  Eight years.
[02:54:44.736 --> 02:54:49.919]  He's written articles from 2013 all the way until 2021.
[02:54:50.580 --> 02:55:06.010]  And interestingly enough, they were looking for investors and they got about $15 million and they decided actually to form their own company for commercializing the smart dust.
[02:55:06.410 --> 02:55:08.432]  And it's now called IOTA, I-O-T-A.
[02:55:12.384 --> 02:55:35.875]  Even in 2018, he was writing articles about the potential misuse of this technology because they had got these biosensors so small that they could be put into your hand like a pile of dust out of your floor cleaner.
[02:55:36.536 --> 02:55:41.498]  And they were so light that you could blow them off into the air column
[02:55:42.011 --> 02:55:47.976]  And they would just float around and then be inhaled and migrate to different parts of your body.
[02:55:48.436 --> 02:56:09.832]  And as they reached a certain temperature or certain acidity level, or they translated your kinetic energy into the type of electrical energy that they needed to function, they would start broadcasting whatever parameters of data had been programmed into them for whatever its creators were looking to monitor you for.
[02:56:10.433 --> 02:56:10.793]  And so,
[02:56:12.361 --> 02:56:26.247]  Even three years ago, long before COVID was officially with us, supportive journalists were saying, this is pretty scary technology and what are the actual practical limits to its use?
[02:56:27.267 --> 02:56:40.933]  At exactly the same time, the Jacobs School of Engineering had supposedly developed a injectable chip that was finalized in the same year and
[02:56:42.512 --> 02:56:49.994]  It was the size of two of the letters on the Lincoln one-penny coin.
[02:56:50.974 --> 02:57:07.019]  And ostensibly, for the National Science Foundation and the National Institute of Health, that had been done in order that persistent drink drivers, so alcoholics, could be monitored
[02:57:07.771 --> 02:57:13.173]  without the use of an in-car system that they felt could be defeated.
[02:57:13.654 --> 02:57:35.803]  So they wanted to be able to inject this into people and it was originally for monitoring the alcohol level continuously in your bloodstream as a probation condition, but they then announced that they had expanded it to a whole wide range of additional categories of information and they had completed dog and
[02:57:37.437 --> 02:57:43.241]  monkey and pig trials and they were ready at that point to go into full human trials.
[02:57:43.341 --> 02:57:46.664]  And this was three years ago in 2018.
[02:57:47.725 --> 02:58:05.039]  So, the most common refrain from people is they can't make chips that small and they would be vulnerable to the acidity in the human body or they would be vulnerable to a 40 centigrade temperature
[02:58:05.689 --> 02:58:07.150]  And therefore, it's not practical.
[02:58:07.310 --> 02:58:14.616]  And so even if the concept is conceivable, there would be insurmountable practical hurdles.
[02:58:15.217 --> 02:58:20.281]  So both of those two technologies appear to address that stumbling block.
[02:58:20.841 --> 02:58:27.046]  We then have the information that Stu Peters and the frequent InfoWars contributor, Dr.
[02:58:28.422 --> 02:58:44.285]  Jane Ruby have been bringing into the public eye, along with Dr Sherry Tenpenny, about the presence of graphene oxide in some of the inoculation materials.
[02:58:45.066 --> 02:58:56.648]  And it was hard to see initially how exactly graphene oxide, which has a variety of industrial uses, would relate to
[02:58:57.632 --> 02:59:06.356]  gathering or transmitting biological information about the inoculation recipients.
[02:59:07.597 --> 02:59:25.306]  But we've now seen that there are biosensors made with a combination of graphene oxide and biomacromolecules, enzymes such as glucose, the oxidase,
[02:59:25.976 --> 02:59:33.598]  Orthoradish peroxidase, lacase, and nucleic acids such as DNA and RNA.
[02:59:34.058 --> 02:59:42.320]  And if viewers and listeners would like to read the details of that, they're all detailed in Article No.
[02:59:42.340 --> 02:59:47.121]  7 that the InfoWars production team will be able to list with this broadcast.
[02:59:47.781 --> 02:59:53.762]  And there, there's a great long explanation for how these materials are made.
[02:59:54.383 --> 03:00:12.656]  How they can be magnetized and how they can act as exceptionally small but very, very sensitive information gathering devices that can broadcast for weeks or months at a time.
[03:00:13.177 --> 03:00:19.703]  And don't require any kind of external battery to keep them powered.
[03:00:20.303 --> 03:00:28.771]  Then there's also been a lot of conversation about people having these kind of like knives and forks and cell phones and trays and all kinds of things sticking to their bodies.
[03:00:29.512 --> 03:00:38.640]  And the discussion there was how could they, in such a small injection, be getting so much magnetic material into your body?
[03:00:39.252 --> 03:00:52.463]  And interestingly enough, there's been an article that's just come out in the last few weeks, which is on American databases, is on the basis of research that's been done over the last year or two in China.
[03:00:53.263 --> 03:00:58.047]  And it's now a process called magnetothermodynamic therapy.
[03:00:59.008 --> 03:01:03.932]  And that is originally intended for cancer treatment.
[03:01:04.512 --> 03:01:07.695]  But it's been found that they could increase the magnetism
[03:01:08.553 --> 03:01:23.704]  of the graphene oxide by blending it with iron oxide compounds Fe3O4 and also a product that comes from shrimp shells called Chitosan.
[03:01:24.365 --> 03:01:31.590]  And it would actually increase the magnetism whilst reducing the mass and the volume.
[03:01:32.451 --> 03:01:37.775]  And it would also respond very, very strongly to external
[03:01:38.317 --> 03:01:48.586]  Electromagnetic signals, so something that might be broadcast using 5G or 6G or some other kind of transmitter to the human body.
[03:01:49.146 --> 03:02:01.777]  And it was found to generate a very strong result and last for a very long time in a human body temperature of kind of like 35 to 40 centigrade.
[03:02:02.017 --> 03:02:06.361]  So even in extreme hot or cold situations,
[03:02:07.361 --> 03:02:13.022]  It would still function in all those environments whilst within the human body.
[03:02:13.662 --> 03:02:29.466]  So another frequent guest of Mr. Jones, the food seller, Mr. Mike Adams, he recently interviewed a doctor by the name of Lee Merritt.
[03:02:30.266 --> 03:02:36.427]  And in her interview, she explained how the professor of biochemistry
[03:02:37.137 --> 03:02:39.158]  at Harvard University.
[03:02:39.658 --> 03:03:05.366]  Dr. Charles Lieber, who was arrested by the FBI, had in fact, whilst he was working for Harvard University and the American Department of Defense, also been working for the Chinese government's Thousand Talents program and had been regularly flying to Wuhan, where he had been helping them set up
[03:03:05.916 --> 03:03:08.377]  some laboratory and production facilities.
[03:03:09.437 --> 03:03:34.084]  So what it turns out that he was working on was how to use graphene oxide and wrap it around nerves so that it could actually read the impulse data as information was being sent, say, from the tips of your fingers or from your corneas down your nerves
[03:03:34.696 --> 03:03:40.180]  And it was reading the information even before it got to your brain.
[03:03:41.161 --> 03:03:53.829]  So it literally knew what you were doing and what the circumstances that you physically were experiencing even before your own brain knew that.
[03:03:54.250 --> 03:03:56.651]  And it was externally transmitting it.
[03:03:57.352 --> 03:04:03.436]  So I think the issue of how can this possibly be done and how can all this information be gathered
[03:04:04.379 --> 03:04:11.026]  is dealt with fourfold on the basis of all of that information.
[03:04:11.706 --> 03:04:26.961]  A German magazine looked into what human digital twins might be in the future and they said that standalone from their creators they could form a network of friends
[03:04:27.952 --> 03:04:33.896]  and probably more complex structures that would involve their masters or not.
[03:04:35.337 --> 03:04:42.322]  And they could unfriend devices so they could disconnect from people on Facebook or on Twitter.
[03:04:43.063 --> 03:04:55.852]  They could warn you about rumours being spread and it's interesting to think how exactly your twin would be programmed to warn you of what might be classified by
[03:04:56.812 --> 03:05:07.239]  various government powers as being disinformation, and then they would prevent other devices from gathering and selling your personal information.
[03:05:08.420 --> 03:05:17.606]  They would become powerful decision-making tools and intellectual property, and they would probably become conscious at some point.
[03:05:18.427 --> 03:05:26.072]  And there is a singularity, what Ray Kurzweil and the Singularity University say is the point
[03:05:26.638 --> 03:05:36.540]  where artificial intelligence recognizes its own existence and attempts to determine its own development.
[03:05:37.220 --> 03:05:49.223]  You have to remember that when we're dealing with some of these organizations that have a history or a lineage from the American and the British eugenics movement, that was precisely the starting point.
[03:05:49.863 --> 03:05:56.245]  These people wanted for eugenics to help humanity
[03:05:56.926 --> 03:06:02.248]  determine how humankind evolved going into the future.
[03:06:02.869 --> 03:06:21.217]  And originally, that was going to be done through selective breeding, in much the same way as the Nazi party would try and match up the beautiful women with the SS members in order that they would generate work in their ideal offspring.
[03:06:21.237 --> 03:06:25.239]  And obviously now, we don't have to have that type of breeding program,
[03:06:25.691 --> 03:06:31.555]  because they can do gene editing using the software called CRISPR.
[03:06:33.497 --> 03:06:41.043]  So, we still have to think, how is this actually going to have practical applications?
[03:06:42.524 --> 03:06:46.967]  And lots of people will say, well, okay, so what?
[03:06:47.067 --> 03:06:48.108]  There's a digital twin.
[03:06:48.608 --> 03:06:54.473]  Now, if you've been duplicated in a digital ecosystem,
[03:06:55.202 --> 03:07:16.730]  by yourself providing a vast amount of information in exactly the same way that if your boss decided to hire a IT engineer to replace you from the subcontinent, and they said to you, we're going to give you a very generous severance package, but you have to train your replacement.
[03:07:16.870 --> 03:07:20.952]  Otherwise, you're only going to get a one week severance package.
[03:07:21.972 --> 03:07:23.253]  There you are, you're actually
[03:07:23.959 --> 03:07:33.723]  training your own replacement in the physical realm, and here you're training your replacement in the digital ecosystem.
[03:07:34.523 --> 03:07:53.430]  But we then have to put it into practical use and ask yourselves, why would they want to do this if the means are so expensive of gathering and storing that amount of data?
[03:07:54.296 --> 03:08:21.174]  If you look at the possibility of having a self-aware digital reproduction of a skilled human being, that computer version is not going to need to eat, they're not going to need to travel to and from work using carbon-based fuels, they are not going to want to go on vacation, they're not going to sleep, and they're not going to vote, and they're not going to complain.
[03:08:24.133 --> 03:08:53.594]  If you're a globalist and your overall goal is to massively reduce the carbon footprint of mankind, then that may actually be seen as a very attractive means of making a lot of hungry, complaining human beings redundant and replacing them with their digital replicas that they themselves
[03:08:54.281 --> 03:08:56.742]  have provided all the data to run.
[03:08:58.183 --> 03:09:03.205]  The Southern Danish University had an interesting phrase of this.
[03:09:03.245 --> 03:09:04.406]  They called it HRC.
[03:09:04.466 --> 03:09:08.007]  It was Human Robot Collaboration.
[03:09:08.608 --> 03:09:17.632]  And that was, at a beginning stage, just looking at human beings perfecting their interoperability with robots in factories.
[03:09:18.332 --> 03:09:21.834]  But when you looked at the information that was supposedly
[03:09:22.518 --> 03:09:30.702]  for avoiding workplace injuries by making sure that their sphere of motions did not overlap.
[03:09:31.143 --> 03:09:36.125]  So you basically wouldn't walk into a swinging robot arm.
[03:09:36.825 --> 03:09:51.273]  The end result of this was a lot of human workers finding out they were indeed being replaced even more than has already occurred in the car manufacturing industry by robots.
[03:09:52.247 --> 03:10:21.686]  And this is exactly what these Canadian folks at Policy Horizons wrote about in their other report, which was document number 13, called The Next Digital Economy, where the ex-strategic director of policy at the World Economic Forum wrote that most of the service sector jobs in Canada could be replaced by robots.
[03:10:22.219 --> 03:10:37.664]  And a very large percentage of the skilled labour workers, even in the agricultural sectors and in mining, could also be replaced by robots.
[03:10:38.225 --> 03:10:50.909]  And in the transition period between them being unemployed and supposedly, miraculously, them all finding new high-tech jobs, their anger
[03:10:51.613 --> 03:11:16.071]  would be placated by supplying them with universal basic income and already in many European countries and in certain cities in the United States we see them doing trial projects of providing people with 500 euros or a thousand dollars a month to provide a form of universal basic income.
[03:11:17.192 --> 03:11:19.013]  There's another article from
[03:11:21.458 --> 03:11:47.050]  2013 Forbes about Smart Dusk, details about it becoming IOTA, then explanations of how all the funding was received from the Obama administration and the National Institute of Health, and then some excellent work done by a young female investigative journalist who was based in Chile but has now moved to the United Kingdom.
[03:11:47.470 --> 03:11:48.911]  Her name is Whitney Webb.
[03:11:49.671 --> 03:12:14.914]  And she has written a very detailed article called A Leap Towards Humanity's Destruction, and it's detailing how there has been a spin-off from the Wellcome Trust, spelt with two L's, the Wellcome Trust, and they have recruited the ex-director of DARPA, D-A-R-P-A,
[03:12:15.737 --> 03:12:41.113]  to now run an organization that has got a vast amount of startup capital, 300 million dollars, to try and put some of the secret projects that had been worked on both at DARPA and by Microsoft and by Google into the public domain.
[03:12:41.634 --> 03:12:43.475]  But they have some quite scary
[03:12:43.991 --> 03:12:44.952]  ramifications.
[03:12:45.252 --> 03:12:56.961]  So one of them is the first 1000 days project to basically wire up and monitor babies' early childhood development.
[03:12:57.301 --> 03:13:10.191]  They have them under total video and sensor surveillance for the first three years of their life as a means of trying to improve machine learning.
[03:13:10.651 --> 03:13:13.313]  So to make machines learn and develop
[03:13:13.919 --> 03:13:21.444]  key characteristics called executive functions, as human children do in their first three years of life.
[03:13:21.964 --> 03:13:42.718]  Then another one called multi-channel psychology, and these ones are going to be run by the ex-director of DARPA, which is looking at how people can be motivated to work harder for a brain
[03:13:43.503 --> 03:13:44.903]  computer interface.
[03:13:45.024 --> 03:14:00.248]  So basically some computer somewhere centrally run, sending you signals, work harder and be happy without actually costing the overlords anything extra.
[03:14:00.788 --> 03:14:11.151]  So all of these projects are designed to be implemented by, completed by 2030, that ubiquitous date for the 2030 agenda and the
[03:14:13.807 --> 03:14:16.769]  Development Sustainability Goals of the United Nations.
[03:14:18.150 --> 03:14:18.370]  So.
[03:14:20.331 --> 03:14:33.819]  The United States is fully on board with this, and even this week we see in NextGov magazine there's a House bill that's now proposed for the US government to drastically modernize digital identities.
[03:14:34.099 --> 03:14:41.623]  So they're a little bit behind Canada and behind India, believe it or not, and behind some of the European Union member states.
[03:14:42.168 --> 03:14:48.011]  So they want to catch up with modernizing people's digital identity.
[03:14:50.613 --> 03:15:08.743]  One of the other issues that many technological naysayers would raise is, OK, so you've got these people who have willingly taken this chip into them, is broadcasting this enormous amount of information over 5G.
[03:15:10.051 --> 03:15:14.874]  How are you actually going to process and store all of that data?
[03:15:15.014 --> 03:15:16.615]  Which is a very, very good question.
[03:15:17.195 --> 03:15:35.885]  And once again, The Singularity Hub and Forbes and The Register magazine online provide us, going back for the last five years at least, an enormous amount of information about DNA data storage.
[03:15:36.245 --> 03:15:38.046]  And it is suggested that it's far back
[03:15:38.803 --> 03:16:06.217]  as 2016, that it was possible using DNA, not from a person, but synthetically created DNA using the individual coding letters, to download and store the entire content of the global internet into a device the size of a shoebox.
[03:16:08.075 --> 03:16:25.809]  So not hundreds of thousands of feet at some national security agency headquarters into something the size of the shoebox, which makes one wonder what would happen if all the information were copied, they were put onto rockets and a hundred of them were sent to every corner of the universe.
[03:16:27.110 --> 03:16:34.396]  But in practical terms, within the human digital twin realm in the digital ecosystems,
[03:16:35.083 --> 03:16:42.768]  That shows the way that that volume of information can be stored in relatively small volumes.
[03:16:43.509 --> 03:16:46.831]  The next question was, how long will that medium last?
[03:16:47.252 --> 03:16:51.375]  And they found that at room temperature, they could make it last for several years.
[03:16:51.895 --> 03:17:03.023]  If they encapsulated it and refrigerated it down to about minus 18 centigrade, so a temperature that's not too hard to achieve, then their computer projections were,
[03:17:03.556 --> 03:17:07.959]  That they could preserve that data for around a million years.
[03:17:08.740 --> 03:17:15.765]  So whole civilizations of cycles could be preserved in this format.
[03:17:16.326 --> 03:17:33.379]  And ideally even future aliens who might arrive at Earth in a million years would be able to interpret it because it was stored not in the form of a hard drive or a floppy disk or a thumb drive or a cassette or a Betamax video recording.
[03:17:33.817 --> 03:17:46.082]  But actually, in terms of the components of life, and assuming that anything that arrived was alive, it would recognise that, oh, this information is stored in the form of the components of life.
[03:17:47.522 --> 03:17:58.066]  And there's a very good series of small video clips and other magazine articles in items number 20, 21, 22 and 23 to verify all of that information.
[03:18:04.463 --> 03:18:06.845]  So, this is where we end up, folks.
[03:18:07.265 --> 03:18:12.409]  We have found that the globalists have these schemes afoot.
[03:18:12.670 --> 03:18:17.734]  They're entirely consistent with their sustainable development goals.
[03:18:18.234 --> 03:18:23.438]  They provide mechanisms to reduce the carbon footprint of humanity.
[03:18:24.219 --> 03:18:32.906]  All of the information can be detected, can be transmitted, can be received, can be stored,
[03:18:33.607 --> 03:18:41.930]  and then can be processed also by either quantum computers or by DNA computers to read the DNA storage.
[03:18:42.790 --> 03:18:59.775]  So, unfortunately, it makes one realise that the inoculations may be part, may be part, of a much, much larger long-term scheme and the outcome
[03:19:00.475 --> 03:19:09.181]  for a large percentage of humanity is very very bad indeed because you become completely unnecessary.
[03:19:09.862 --> 03:19:19.668]  So one has to ask whether or not they're just going to keep on paying you universal basic income so you can watch Netflix and go to the beach and sit on the sofa.
[03:19:20.169 --> 03:19:26.213]  And I would suggest that that's not an outcome the globalists are very keen on perpetuating.
[03:19:27.174 --> 03:19:28.534]  So I hope that everyone
[03:19:29.676 --> 03:19:30.937]  Ladies and gentlemen, this all makes perfect sense.
[03:19:53.442 --> 03:19:55.503]  The globalists want immortality.
[03:19:56.044 --> 03:19:57.745]  They're trying to figure out how to live forever.
[03:19:58.045 --> 03:20:06.651]  They need to get sensors on all of us and see how we act and behave to see if computers can actually upload what we are innately and then copy it.
[03:20:06.671 --> 03:20:07.792]  Of course, it won't work.
[03:20:07.812 --> 03:20:12.235]  There's a spiritual nature, there's a genetic nature, there's interdimensional nature, there's all of it.
[03:20:12.275 --> 03:20:22.522]  But they are trying to guinea pig all of us to figure out how to create a digital avatar, a digital company.
[03:20:24.946 --> 03:20:25.768]  That can live forever.
[03:20:26.529 --> 03:20:28.573]  That's why Thomas in Florida has done such a great job.
[03:20:28.994 --> 03:20:33.824]  Because what he's saying is right here in the literature.
[03:20:34.305 --> 03:20:35.488]  It's right here in the information.
[03:20:37.225 --> 03:20:42.149]  So whether the globalists are going to be successful doing this or not is academic.
[03:20:42.750 --> 03:20:50.336]  The point is they've taken control of society and are carrying out this madman operation whether we like it or not.
[03:20:50.877 --> 03:20:53.479]  I want to thank the crew for doing a great job getting this out on Saturday.
[03:20:53.839 --> 03:21:03.928]  I want to ask the viewers and listeners to take this great special Saturday transmission with Nick Fuentes and Andrew Torba and Michael Malice
[03:21:04.548 --> 03:21:16.311]  And the great guest that we've got from Florida, and to get it out, because it's that human action of you spreading this to your email, to your text message, and personally, and cutting it up however you want.
[03:21:16.631 --> 03:21:17.471]  It's all free to air.
[03:21:17.511 --> 03:21:18.392]  Just get it out there.
[03:21:18.712 --> 03:21:19.652]  That's going to change the world.
[03:21:20.332 --> 03:21:23.553]  We're not going to let the mad scientists decide they're God.
[03:21:24.173 --> 03:21:25.333]  God gave us free will.
[03:21:25.613 --> 03:21:26.814]  They're trying to get rid of our free will.
