[00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:01.850]  The world is rejecting the globalists.
[00:00:02.251 --> 00:00:03.772]  They're rejecting the neoliberals.
[00:00:04.232 --> 00:00:12.258]  They're rejecting George Soros, who now with Bill Gates is going to be over the UN global testing regime and control the contact tracer apps.
[00:00:12.298 --> 00:00:13.278]  I mean, what a nightmare.
[00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:17.321]  George Soros with the Clinton Foundation and Bill Gates can control your medical files?
[00:00:17.661 --> 00:00:18.802]  They're not going to get away with this.
[00:00:19.163 --> 00:00:29.610]  I'm just so ashamed of the average leftist subserviently wanting a vaccine pass and wanting to get all the shots and just buying into the fraud and pretending like they're part of the establishment.
[00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:30.751]  It's these people.
[00:00:31.372 --> 00:00:37.539]  It's the proletariat left going along with this, pretending like they're part of the ruling class that is going to destroy us.
[00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:42.384]  We have to realize communism is a tool of the ruling class to suppress and wage war against the people.
[00:00:43.205 --> 00:00:44.467]  It is a tool of the ruling class.
[00:00:44.807 --> 00:00:48.351]  It was created by British intelligence to get rid of their czar cousins.
[00:00:48.531 --> 00:00:49.192]  It is the enemy.
[00:00:49.633 --> 00:00:50.213]  Russia had it.
[00:00:51.607 --> 00:00:55.149]  For 80 years controlling them and finally kicked it out partially, that's why they hate Russia.
[00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:59.411]  We need to arrest the oligarchs and put their asses in prison, just like Russia's done.
[00:00:59.431 --> 00:01:00.652]  And we need to move forward.
[00:01:00.672 --> 00:01:02.172]  If we don't do that, we have no future, Owen.
[00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:05.334]  And I think when you see what happened in St.
[00:01:05.354 --> 00:01:12.017]  Louis County, where they just had a vote of seven people on a board, just aye, yay or nay, do we have vast mandated masks?
[00:01:12.078 --> 00:01:13.358]  And they five to two said no.
[00:01:13.578 --> 00:01:14.639]  That's the real America.
[00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.801]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:23.792 --> 00:01:51.059]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, the two big subjects of discussion for today are obviously going to be the mixed messages coming from our health officials and of course the media lying about it, where the CDC director is admitting that vaccinated people are responsible for
[00:01:52.577 --> 00:01:56.843]  This new outbreak, this new spread that's admitted by the CDC.
[00:01:57.744 --> 00:02:01.929]  I'm actually shocked and stunned that the CDC director is admitting it.
[00:02:04.833 --> 00:02:05.434]  But of course.
[00:02:07.563 --> 00:02:22.594]  On the back end saying, yeah, the vaccinated people are causing the spread and it's the highly vaccinated communities where it's the biggest outbreak and the vaccines aren't working, but we're still going to mandate the vaccines and now you need to wear a mask for the next two weeks.
[00:02:22.834 --> 00:02:27.057]  Oh, there's that nice two weeks again to stop the spread.
[00:02:27.077 --> 00:02:29.999]  Hmm.
[00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.162]  Where have we heard that before?
[00:02:35.054 --> 00:02:40.136]  And so we're going to be joined by Alex Jones coming up in the next segment, breaking all of that down.
[00:02:41.116 --> 00:02:50.080]  Then, in the aftermath of yesterday's January 6th show hearings, with a bunch of Democrat activists posing as police officers.
[00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:51.561]  Yes, that's right.
[00:02:52.381 --> 00:03:03.295]  Democrat activists posing as police officers, as neutral observers, as neutral reporters, know we now have the receipts.
[00:03:03.816 --> 00:03:06.139]  In fact, I've got a whole stack of them right here.
[00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:21.397]  How specifically one officer, but all of them, but one officer will be highlighted, and he was the one that they made the biggest deal of, made claims that he was called the N-word during the events of January 6th.
[00:03:21.517 --> 00:03:25.920]  Doesn't produce any body cam footage, of course, because he's making it up Jesse Smollett style.
[00:03:28.737 --> 00:03:32.560]  And now it turns out we've got all of his tweets going back four years.
[00:03:33.281 --> 00:03:40.187]  An avid leftist, an avid Democrat, an avid Trump-hater, and he's the voice of reason.
[00:03:40.607 --> 00:03:42.969]  He's the neutral voice of reason on January 6th?
[00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:44.190]  I don't think so.
[00:03:46.572 --> 00:03:52.257]  And then of course it turns out that his lawyer, Mark Zide, you may have heard of him,
[00:03:53.624 --> 00:04:03.372]  Big Democrat activist, big-time Democrat activist, and he's the lawyer representing Officer Dunn.
[00:04:03.692 --> 00:04:16.302]  So, again, the entire hearing yesterday was nothing more than propaganda, nothing more than lies, and
[00:04:19.966 --> 00:04:29.729]  The American media and the Democrat Party think you're too stupid, or you're too lazy, to go out and do a tiny bit of research on these individuals, and that's all it took!
[00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:36.032]  A couple journalists just did a tiny bit of research, and they found dozens of tweets.
[00:04:36.912 --> 00:04:47.856]  Oh, and not only are they avowed Democrat activists that have been implanted into the DC police, as I was warned about three years ago by the DC police,
[00:04:49.326 --> 00:05:01.891]  When I was sitting in a jail cell, I was told, they said, Owen, you're not going to believe what's going on here, but Democrats have implanted activists into our units and there's nothing we can do about it.
[00:05:03.412 --> 00:05:04.172]  And they all know it.
[00:05:05.313 --> 00:05:07.274]  And you just saw them on Capitol Hill yesterday.
[00:05:07.354 --> 00:05:10.095]  Now they've been unmasked, pun not intended.
[00:05:13.696 --> 00:05:14.777]  So we'll talk about that.
[00:05:16.681 --> 00:05:19.262]  But coming up in the next segment is Alex Jones.
[00:05:22.164 --> 00:05:25.046]  And they admit the vaccine doesn't work.
[00:05:25.706 --> 00:05:29.608]  They now admit the vaccine doesn't work, but they're promoting a third booster.
[00:05:30.649 --> 00:05:37.593]  So the vaccine doesn't work, the mask doesn't work, but they're going to force you to wear a mask and force you to take a vaccine.
[00:05:39.134 --> 00:05:40.034]  It's all slavery.
[00:05:40.814 --> 00:05:41.395]  That's what it is.
[00:05:44.005 --> 00:05:51.475]  They have never guessed the right flu virus for the mutation of what the main flu is the next year, and it's always a whole bunch of flus, dozens and dozens of them.
[00:05:52.116 --> 00:05:56.762]  And that it does nothing to protect you from the next flu if it's not the exact flu!
[00:05:58.905 --> 00:06:01.668]  That's why they never ask why they don't have a vaccine for the common cold.
[00:06:01.968 --> 00:06:03.109]  Because it's too varied.
[00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:04.590]  Because there's thousands of them.
[00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:06.852]  And because you have to get it exactly right.
[00:06:07.132 --> 00:06:08.594]  And viruses are always mutating.
[00:06:08.754 --> 00:06:10.576]  But you notice they're telling you they've got a vaccine.
[00:06:10.916 --> 00:06:14.239]  They want you willingly to go take whatever it is that's going to be in there.
[00:06:14.739 --> 00:06:17.021]  Now Fauci has come out of you.
[00:06:17.061 --> 00:06:17.482]  Just joined us.
[00:06:17.502 --> 00:06:19.063]  We're going to play the clip again first here in a moment.
[00:06:19.744 --> 00:06:22.146]  And said, hey, we're going to surveil people.
[00:06:22.166 --> 00:06:23.687]  We're going to cycle into other seasons.
[00:06:23.807 --> 00:06:25.129]  Next year you won't be able to go out either.
[00:06:26.383 --> 00:06:33.689]  So they'll run into the middle of summer, and then let you have a month or two, and then clamp it back down, but there'll be special apps they're announcing, you'll be tracked, China was the model.
[00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.412]  They're gonna roll it out like they just got these ideas, but it's all pre-planned.
[00:06:38.393 --> 00:06:46.699]  By the Rockefeller Foundation, Bill and Melinda Gates, the tabletop exercises, predicting COVID-19 in November when it was already launched in China.
[00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:54.526]  I think all of you already instinctively know this is the big one, and if we fail this test, we're gonna be ruled by the threat
[00:06:55.709 --> 00:06:58.913]  ...of unending invisible bio-weapons.
[00:07:06.556 --> 00:07:09.497]  Immediately that aren't even as bad as the current strain.
[00:07:09.517 --> 00:07:14.059]  They'll say they're worse, fear monger and then clamp down even stronger.
[00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:15.980]  That's what they've done in Italy.
[00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:21.262]  It's what they've done in other areas where they've been beta testing like Spain and now moving towards Australia.
[00:07:21.282 --> 00:07:22.442]  So this is all formulaic.
[00:07:22.502 --> 00:07:25.344]  It's all heavily scripted and we know their plan.
[00:07:26.424 --> 00:07:34.307]  InfoWars.
[00:07:34.387 --> 00:07:35.508]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:07:35.568 --> 00:07:35.928]  Today.
[00:07:37.892 --> 00:07:38.692]  You don't need a mask.
[00:07:38.732 --> 00:07:40.153]  The mask is about compliance.
[00:07:40.373 --> 00:07:42.454]  Because they know Canadians like to do what they're told.
[00:07:42.754 --> 00:07:44.255]  So they tell you, you have to wear a mask.
[00:07:44.595 --> 00:07:46.416]  Next they're going to tell you, you have to contact trace.
[00:07:46.776 --> 00:07:48.737]  Then they're going to tell you, you have to take the vaccine.
[00:07:49.057 --> 00:07:52.579]  And because Canadians like to do what they're told, they're hoping that everyone just complies.
[00:07:52.859 --> 00:07:53.900]  And then guess what, kids?
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:58.042]  Once you take your vaccine, like a dumb person that doesn't know any better,
[00:07:58.562 --> 00:08:10.271]  They're gonna tell you, sorry, the vaccine isn't as effective as we thought it was gonna be, so now you still gotta wear your mask, still gotta get contact trace, still have all the restrictions and social distancing, and still take your vaccine.
[00:08:10.531 --> 00:08:11.953]  And then what did you get out of all of this?
[00:08:12.333 --> 00:08:19.559]  You got a whole year where you weren't allowed to travel, your business was closed, they took your rights and freedoms, they forced a vaccine on you, and...
[00:08:20.319 --> 00:08:20.819]  What happened?
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.421]  The same amount of people died.
[00:08:22.781 --> 00:08:23.962]  Everything is the exact same.
[00:08:24.182 --> 00:08:30.526]  And now they're going to put you back on lockdown and bring it all the way till July of next year so they can do the same thing again.
[00:08:30.887 --> 00:08:36.570]  Bring you from July, August and September, getting you off lockdown, but just to bring you back on lockdown again.
[00:08:36.591 --> 00:08:38.532]  If you idiots haven't figured it out yet.
[00:08:38.932 --> 00:08:41.873]  It's a perpetual cycle that you never get out of.
[00:08:42.133 --> 00:08:46.795]  And it's a way to take your rights, your freedoms, close your business, take your wealth.
[00:08:47.095 --> 00:08:47.375]  Why?
[00:08:47.455 --> 00:08:49.076]  So you become dependent on government.
[00:08:49.456 --> 00:08:49.776]  Why?
[00:08:49.796 --> 00:08:53.177]  If you're independent, the government works for you like it's supposed to.
[00:08:53.498 --> 00:09:02.521]  If you depend on the government to give you a paycheck to feed your family every month because they closed your business on you, now the government doesn't work for you, the government rules you.
[00:09:02.881 --> 00:09:04.962]  So instead of a middle class, we have
[00:09:05.342 --> 00:09:10.686]  The government, upper class, and the lower class dependents that rely on the government to survive.
[00:09:10.967 --> 00:09:12.908]  In other words, we have a slave class.
[00:09:13.409 --> 00:09:14.369]  And that's what they're trying to do.
[00:09:14.429 --> 00:09:15.030]  It's that simple.
[00:09:16.107 --> 00:09:26.856]  So ladies and gentlemen, now you understand why InfoWars had to be banned off of the internet well in advance of this operation going down.
[00:09:28.017 --> 00:09:33.962]  Now you know why they had to demonize InfoWars and lie about Alex Jones and lie about what we do here.
[00:09:34.783 --> 00:09:39.606]  Because if we had the ear of the nation, if we had the ear of the world,
[00:09:40.836 --> 00:09:42.397]  Then none of this would be going on.
[00:09:43.238 --> 00:09:45.379]  They would have said, no, we were warned about this.
[00:09:45.519 --> 00:09:46.840]  We're not going to comply.
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.801]  We're not going to fall for the propaganda.
[00:09:49.081 --> 00:09:50.202]  We're going to remain free.
[00:09:50.442 --> 00:09:51.683]  You're not going to deceive us.
[00:09:52.263 --> 00:09:53.284]  But they lied about us.
[00:09:53.364 --> 00:09:55.786]  They demonized us and they censored us off the Internet.
[00:09:56.206 --> 00:09:57.307]  Now they are running.
[00:09:58.618 --> 00:10:04.063]  Phase two, phase three, phase whatever of their global tyranny.
[00:10:04.483 --> 00:10:07.405]  Imprisonment of man for the rest of time.
[00:10:07.726 --> 00:10:10.848]  This is the Alex Jones Show live on this Wednesday, July 28, 2021.
[00:10:11.168 --> 00:10:15.152]  Owen Schroer in the InfoWars World Headquarters in Austin, Texas.
[00:10:15.252 --> 00:10:18.695]  Alex Jones on the phone with us now.
[00:10:19.475 --> 00:10:22.898]  And so it doesn't matter that the CDC says the vaccine doesn't work.
[00:10:22.938 --> 00:10:24.800]  They're even pushing for a third booster.
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.323]  It doesn't matter that they admit the mask doesn't work.
[00:10:27.363 --> 00:10:28.604]  They want you to wear it forever.
[00:10:28.844 --> 00:10:33.749]  And they've even brought back the old moniker, Alex, of two weeks to slow the spread.
[00:10:34.069 --> 00:10:36.091]  Boy, they really think we're stupid, don't they?
[00:10:37.492 --> 00:10:46.634]  Well, they do, Owen, and I wasn't intending to be on today, but this huge CDC announcement you said was imminent yesterday did happen right after you got off the air, so I'm actually on the road here.
[00:10:47.334 --> 00:10:48.855]  Can you, am I coming in clear for you?
[00:10:49.175 --> 00:10:49.975]  Loud and clear.
[00:10:51.415 --> 00:10:54.256]  Okay, I need listeners to listen to me very carefully.
[00:10:54.296 --> 00:10:57.277]  We can beat this, but we don't have much time, and
[00:10:57.785 --> 00:10:58.926]  We do have the year of the nation.
[00:10:58.966 --> 00:11:00.587]  We have the year of the world of the people that count.
[00:11:01.047 --> 00:11:06.510]  The hardcore folks from every continent and every region of every race, color, and creed who bleed red blood.
[00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:07.230]  I love you all.
[00:11:07.631 --> 00:11:08.831]  This is an attack on humans.
[00:11:08.851 --> 00:11:10.232]  This is a post-industrial world.
[00:11:10.752 --> 00:11:21.318]  This is a system designed to confuse people, designed to destroy confidence, designed to discredit American institutions when it's globalists that are actually doing this.
[00:11:21.899 --> 00:11:22.399]  All of this
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:31.225]  Whether it's destroying the police or whether it's destroying the family, all of this doesn't mean families are perfect or police are perfect, but they were our institutions.
[00:11:31.785 --> 00:11:35.667]  Those are being destroyed and discredited now to bring in their new world order.
[00:11:35.707 --> 00:11:44.913]  And the people bringing it in, Cover Story, New Yorker Magazine, do not forget, 30 plus thousand children as young as two given to hardcore rapists to be gang raped.
[00:11:45.473 --> 00:11:49.015]  Now, I told you this years ago, but the point is, is that that's who runs things.
[00:11:49.456 --> 00:11:51.657]  People that have a mindset like that, people like Ed Buck,
[00:11:52.945 --> 00:12:10.452]  Who had a giant red skull on the wall and would vampirically torture black men and he said I'm sucking your energy and he would want them to OD and start dying and then he would give them the drug to not OD to bring them back and he said he was feeding on their energy.
[00:12:10.492 --> 00:12:16.455]  Okay, that's low-level stuff ladies and gentlemen and now the videos are being shown in LA in court of him
[00:12:17.379 --> 00:12:20.442]  Over them, saying, I'm sucking your energy, give me your soul.
[00:12:20.842 --> 00:12:23.404]  That's a low-level Renfield operator, okay?
[00:12:24.084 --> 00:12:27.947]  Need to understand, because they got a thing for sucking the energy of black men, too.
[00:12:27.967 --> 00:12:29.208]  And I spent the whole show on this.
[00:12:29.428 --> 00:12:30.369]  It's just insane.
[00:12:30.409 --> 00:12:31.450]  It's in all the criminology.
[00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:33.311]  But there's different types of empires.
[00:12:34.272 --> 00:12:36.694]  They don't have fangs, but they do drink blood.
[00:12:37.014 --> 00:12:39.176]  They don't live forever, but the spirits in them are very, very old.
[00:12:39.216 --> 00:12:41.418]  That's why, you know, the old thing is, oh, they're immortal.
[00:12:41.858 --> 00:12:45.781]  And that's why in Transylvania or all over Europe, they said, don't get near the castle at night to their kids.
[00:12:46.727 --> 00:12:48.729]  The vampire will grab you and eat you because it was true.
[00:12:48.749 --> 00:12:53.414]  The lord or his son or whoever would grab you and rape you and murder you.
[00:12:53.875 --> 00:12:55.497]  So that's where all these legends come from.
[00:12:55.517 --> 00:12:59.541]  It's psychotic ruling elites that are inbred.
[00:13:00.049 --> 00:13:06.113]  And that's why in ancient Japan they had stories of, don't go by the castle at night, because some of the nobles were evil.
[00:13:06.234 --> 00:13:07.695]  They would grab you and drink your blood.
[00:13:08.115 --> 00:13:10.317]  Every culture said, don't go near the castle at night.
[00:13:10.957 --> 00:13:13.159]  Men in black will jump out with fangs and drink your blood.
[00:13:13.599 --> 00:13:18.402]  So again, that's not because they're real vampires, but because they are these satanic, demon-possessed people.
[00:13:18.442 --> 00:13:25.408]  The ancient Greeks would lock up certain areas at night because there were psychotics that would go in there and grab people and drink their blood.
[00:13:25.628 --> 00:13:26.228]  Look that up, folks.
[00:13:26.248 --> 00:13:27.069]  That's mainstream history.
[00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:30.001]  We're giving you tomorrow's news today.
[00:13:30.601 --> 00:13:35.503]  If none of this makes sense to you, it's because you don't want to tie down two-year-olds and suck their blood.
[00:13:36.023 --> 00:13:44.506]  You don't want to OD black men and then bring them back over and over again with adrenaline injections because you want to suck their souls.
[00:13:45.106 --> 00:13:55.510]  You're not a person who even thinks like that to have a giant red skull and a black magic temple where the head of the House Intelligence Committee reportedly liked to party with that buck.
[00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:57.151]  You're not one of these people.
[00:13:58.614 --> 00:13:59.595]  I wasn't trying to be calm.
[00:13:59.615 --> 00:14:02.897]  I was trying to just come on and talk about why this is such a big deal.
[00:14:03.197 --> 00:14:09.702]  But there was a clip of myself in February, March, and April and May of last year telling it was coming.
[00:14:10.062 --> 00:14:15.125]  Then there was a clip of Sky in May after me laying out the exact same thing.
[00:14:15.946 --> 00:14:16.766]  How do we know it was coming?
[00:14:18.047 --> 00:14:24.532]  Because we understand what we're dealing with, we understand the enemy's operations, and they've scripted it all out in white papers.
[00:14:25.132 --> 00:14:27.894]  What's incredible is, is we always said they're going to announce
[00:14:29.036 --> 00:14:37.340]  In the end, that the vaccinator shatters, and that the vaccinators, I mean those that have been injected, are basically diseased now.
[00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:38.080]  How do we know that?
[00:14:39.201 --> 00:14:44.883]  It's an Operation Crimson Contagion from three years before the event.
[00:14:45.483 --> 00:14:53.507]  And then Crimson Contagion is set in real time, contemporary now, that it comes out within a year of the injections that they were poisoned and maimed people.
[00:14:54.108 --> 00:14:57.210]  And that it's going to shed all these new viruses, which I don't even think is true.
[00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:00.973]  I think they're going to release new versions that they've had cooked up already in those labs.
[00:15:01.553 --> 00:15:06.856]  But then that's why they had COVID-19 as basically an attenuated virus that I actually predicted three years ago.
[00:15:07.297 --> 00:15:09.398]  They were released an attenuated first, get you used to it.
[00:15:09.798 --> 00:15:14.341]  Then they would release new bioweapons in a similar family, but claim that they were naturally occurring.
[00:15:14.702 --> 00:15:18.044]  That way you won't get a nuclear war started between countries blaming each other.
[00:15:19.454 --> 00:15:21.795]  We're going to come back and I'm going to finish up and let Owen take over.
[00:15:21.815 --> 00:15:26.377]  He's got a lot to say, but I'm going to tie it all together with the January 6th information and so much more.
[00:15:27.578 --> 00:15:30.299]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live Wednesday edition.
[00:15:30.319 --> 00:15:33.820]  I'm Alex Jones, hijacking my own show because the news is just so insane.
[00:15:34.381 --> 00:15:37.142]  I gotta say, Owen's been doing an excellent job boiling all this down.
[00:15:37.162 --> 00:15:46.646]  I just want to point out that January 6th is all about taking that Threat Assessment National Memorandum of the President, the puppet, two months ago, Joe Biden,
[00:15:47.629 --> 00:16:01.536]  I've been hammering on and declaring that anyone that questions lockdowns, fraudulent elections, open borders, or legitimacy of anything Biden does as a terrorist and directs the Pentagon, the CIA, to spy on and attack the American people.
[00:16:01.776 --> 00:16:06.118]  They even on TV talk about taking out members of Congress, Frank Figliuzzi and others.
[00:16:06.158 --> 00:16:09.740]  So, they are really trying to get their forces ready.
[00:16:11.162 --> 00:16:13.423]  For a permanent coup, because they've already stolen the election.
[00:16:13.463 --> 00:16:15.284]  Now they have to submit their ill-gotten gains.
[00:16:15.384 --> 00:16:17.725]  So that's the historic point we've gotten to.
[00:16:17.745 --> 00:16:28.209]  And so all the theater we saw yesterday by the political operatives, all of that, again, is meant to brand the American people and the opposition and the unvaccinated as terrorists.
[00:16:28.229 --> 00:16:30.991]  But they thought they'd get 60, 70 percent, 80 percent to take it.
[00:16:31.951 --> 00:16:34.512]  It's way less than 50 from the numbers they've got.
[00:16:35.393 --> 00:16:36.333]  They've been exaggerating.
[00:16:37.646 --> 00:16:39.788]  And so they've got a big problem on their hands.
[00:16:39.828 --> 00:16:44.972]  So they're going to double back on the group that they've already got under their control and say, oh, you've got Stockholm syndrome.
[00:16:45.573 --> 00:16:48.896]  You're like an abused prostitute under a pimp's control that breaks her arm.
[00:16:50.277 --> 00:16:53.920]  We're going to come back at you now and say, guess what?
[00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:54.841]  You've got to wear a mask, too.
[00:16:54.861 --> 00:16:55.882]  And you've got to take more shots.
[00:16:55.942 --> 00:16:57.643]  Well, Bill Gates said that over a year ago.
[00:16:57.683 --> 00:16:58.784]  This has all been attempted.
[00:16:59.565 --> 00:17:00.606]  This has all been planned out.
[00:17:00.726 --> 00:17:02.768]  And I just want to reach out to the Democrats.
[00:17:04.609 --> 00:17:05.250]  Every crowd on the ground.
[00:17:05.885 --> 00:17:08.126]  You're not going to get money and power and control out of this.
[00:17:08.666 --> 00:17:13.689]  I know you've been trained to hate Christians and hate Republicans and feel like you're part of the intellectual elite and everything because you buy into all this.
[00:17:14.469 --> 00:17:15.390]  All you are is schmucks.
[00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:16.991]  All you are is idiots.
[00:17:18.291 --> 00:17:19.432]  The globalists use you.
[00:17:19.472 --> 00:17:20.312]  They're destroying you.
[00:17:20.332 --> 00:17:22.293]  This is a post-human, post-industrial world.
[00:17:22.814 --> 00:17:24.414]  You're not going to get any power out of this.
[00:17:24.875 --> 00:17:29.177]  The average Democrat's got two or three degrees, and they work bagging groceries.
[00:17:29.897 --> 00:17:31.378]  But everybody I know that doesn't have degrees
[00:17:32.262 --> 00:17:33.422]  I'm not putting folks down that have degrees.
[00:17:33.482 --> 00:17:35.663]  I'm saying, you know, are making $200,000 a year, $100,000 a year.
[00:17:36.163 --> 00:17:40.824]  So I just really feel sorry for these folks because they're in a cult.
[00:17:41.745 --> 00:17:43.145]  They're lied to every step of the way.
[00:17:43.765 --> 00:17:49.047]  They're told, oh, your vaccine isn't working because other people didn't take the shot.
[00:17:49.067 --> 00:17:53.728]  But now they have to admit, no, you're the ones that are actually shedding all these new
[00:17:54.986 --> 00:17:55.547]  We're good to go.
[00:18:23.038 --> 00:18:25.919]  That's part of the official UN Replacement Migration Plan.
[00:18:25.979 --> 00:18:35.943]  So again, we can continue to tell you exactly what's going to happen years before it happens, or we can do something and organize and get serious and move against these globalists.
[00:18:35.963 --> 00:18:40.425]  So more and more, Owen, I just ask the question, how do we form the opposition to this?
[00:18:40.485 --> 00:18:43.486]  When Fauci ran the lab, they obviously released it on purpose.
[00:18:43.826 --> 00:18:45.067]  They blocked all the good treatments.
[00:18:46.047 --> 00:18:48.108]  For regular flus and colds, killing millions.
[00:18:48.308 --> 00:18:50.108]  They've starved tens of millions to death, the U.N.
[00:18:50.169 --> 00:18:50.989]  admits, when the U.N.'
[00:18:50.969 --> 00:18:51.989]  's the one that ran the whole thing.
[00:18:52.449 --> 00:18:54.190]  They are mass-murdering criminals.
[00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:59.812]  We are in their clutches, and they're only going to keep pushing this assault until they get pushed back against.
[00:19:00.252 --> 00:19:11.316]  So the question is, how do we begin to aggressively, legally, and lawfully push back against them, when they've already lost the Rubicon and are violently assaulting us with these poison GMO cranking shots?
[00:19:12.637 --> 00:19:13.537]  I mean, what do we do, Owen?
[00:19:14.707 --> 00:19:18.570]  Well, historically, Alex, I do believe there's two answers to this question.
[00:19:18.891 --> 00:19:26.057]  And the one obvious answer is what we're trying to avoid at all costs, and that's a violent confrontation with these people.
[00:19:26.818 --> 00:19:31.282]  Again, that's just historically what you have to do in the face of tyranny, in the face of oppression.
[00:19:31.642 --> 00:19:33.043]  But we'd like to avoid that.
[00:19:33.083 --> 00:19:35.085]  We don't want a violent confrontation.
[00:19:35.225 --> 00:19:36.587]  We know what that would look like.
[00:19:37.107 --> 00:19:39.669]  And that's not even necessarily an assured victory.
[00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:57.444]  We've got Putin announcing today they're launching two new doomsday planes in case of a nuclear war because Putin understands that if the American globalist corrupt regime actually gets questioned and loses their seat dominating the world like they have been, then they'll just launch a nuclear war.
[00:19:57.784 --> 00:20:07.192]  That's why they were able to get Trump out of the White House because they threatened him and they said, look, if you don't leave and you actually lead this American populist resistance against us, we're just going to blow the planet up.
[00:20:07.592 --> 00:20:09.254]  And Trump didn't want that to happen on his watch.
[00:20:09.274 --> 00:20:10.215]  You can say that's a mistake.
[00:20:10.255 --> 00:20:11.216]  You can say it's a good thing.
[00:20:11.536 --> 00:20:13.057]  That's how they got him out of the White House.
[00:20:13.077 --> 00:20:13.958]  He knew he won.
[00:20:15.039 --> 00:20:16.721]  And Owen, I'm really glad you bring that point up.
[00:20:16.741 --> 00:20:18.242]  That's a point I meant to make, but I never make.
[00:20:19.083 --> 00:20:24.768]  The globalists saw populist rebellions in Europe, in Asia, in Latin America, in Africa, and in North America.
[00:20:25.229 --> 00:20:25.829]  So they panicked.
[00:20:25.969 --> 00:20:28.352]  And they'd always had on the shelf for population control
[00:20:29.281 --> 00:20:29.661]  I think so.
[00:20:51.169 --> 00:20:54.832]  People like Charlie Munger say he wants to set up a malice regime in America.
[00:20:55.233 --> 00:20:59.376]  Why is Justin Trudeau not in jail saying he wants to turn Canada into China?
[00:20:59.556 --> 00:21:02.439]  I mean, these are declarations of war against humanity, people!
[00:21:03.288 --> 00:21:04.528]  Well, here's the good news, Alex.
[00:21:04.609 --> 00:21:09.951]  Five years ago, most people would have never heard of any of these individuals.
[00:21:10.411 --> 00:21:12.472]  And so we're speeding the timetables up.
[00:21:12.852 --> 00:21:16.153]  Now everybody knows who Anthony Fauci is and wants him arrested.
[00:21:16.473 --> 00:21:21.015]  Now everybody knows the diabolical thoughts and actions of Bill Gates and want him arrested.
[00:21:21.175 --> 00:21:27.738]  So the worm is turning there, but as you said, they have all of these things in their back pocket to bring their slaves to heel.
[00:21:27.778 --> 00:21:30.879]  But Alex, here's the other option in the two
[00:21:31.759 --> 00:21:44.807]  In the question you asked, the two options historically, and that is peacefully and politically use democracies and vote these people out of power, vote people into power who want to do something about this, but there's the hiccup.
[00:21:45.108 --> 00:21:46.288]  They steal our elections!
[00:21:47.009 --> 00:21:49.911]  Who knows the last time we had an actual election in this country?
[00:21:50.211 --> 00:21:55.674]  Who knows the last time Americans actually decided their fate politically with the vote at the ballot box?
[00:21:56.014 --> 00:21:59.537]  And that's why you see the Democrats so up in arms and panicked right now.
[00:22:00.257 --> 00:22:19.325]  About these vote audits coming out, about the push to end the Dominion voting machine rigging of our elections because they know that's their ultimate power over us is the belief that, hey, we can still go vote, we can still peacefully and politically overturn this stuff, we just have to make our voices heard, get to the polls and beat them in a democracy.
[00:22:19.806 --> 00:22:20.946]  They rig all the elections!
[00:22:21.326 --> 00:22:24.888]  So they've already beaten us there because we don't even have free and fair elections!
[00:22:25.328 --> 00:22:27.029]  And that's why they're so panicked over that.
[00:22:28.254 --> 00:22:33.148]  That's right, but as you said, the good news is Trump really won in the count of votes by 70%.
[00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:35.154]  Real internal numbers are coming out.
[00:22:35.723 --> 00:22:37.324]  The world is rejecting the globalists.
[00:22:37.745 --> 00:22:39.266]  They're rejecting the neoliberals.
[00:22:39.726 --> 00:22:47.752]  They're rejecting George Soros, who now with Bill Gates is going to be over the UN global testing regime and control the contact tracer apps.
[00:22:47.792 --> 00:22:48.753]  I mean, what a nightmare.
[00:22:49.033 --> 00:22:52.816]  George Soros with the Clinton Foundation and Bill Gates to control your medical files.
[00:22:53.156 --> 00:22:54.277]  They're not going to get away with this.
[00:22:54.657 --> 00:23:05.105]  I'm just so ashamed of the average leftist subserviently wanting a vaccine pass and wanting to get all the shots and just buying into the fraud and pretending like they're part of the establishment.
[00:23:05.445 --> 00:23:06.225]  It's these people.
[00:23:07.166 --> 00:23:13.027]  It's the proletariat left going along with this, pretending like they're part of the ruling class that's going to destroy us.
[00:23:13.327 --> 00:23:17.869]  We have to realize communism is a tool of the ruling class to suppress and wage war against the people.
[00:23:18.689 --> 00:23:19.949]  It is a tool of the ruling class.
[00:23:20.269 --> 00:23:23.830]  It was created by British intelligence to get rid of their czar cousins.
[00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:24.671]  It is the enemy.
[00:23:25.111 --> 00:23:25.691]  Russia had it.
[00:23:27.382 --> 00:23:29.264]  And I think when you see what happened in St.
[00:23:29.304 --> 00:23:33.927]  Louis County, where they just had a vote of seven people on a board, just aye, yay or nay, do we have mandated masks?
[00:23:33.947 --> 00:23:34.928]  And they five to two said no.
[00:23:35.188 --> 00:23:35.749]  That's the real America.
[00:23:35.769 --> 00:23:36.229]  We're back here live.
[00:23:54.181 --> 00:23:55.202]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:23:55.242 --> 00:23:56.483]  Owen Schroer sitting in studio.
[00:23:56.563 --> 00:23:57.643]  Alex with us on the phone.
[00:23:57.683 --> 00:24:10.632]  He thinks he's about to say goodbye, but I don't think he's going to be able to because I'm about to bring up a couple stories here that I'm not sure you've seen yet, Alex, that are really indicative of the times that we're living in.
[00:24:11.112 --> 00:24:14.034]  First, you have this story out of the Rolling Stone.
[00:24:14.995 --> 00:24:19.756]  I specialize in toilet play, and I can't do it with people who are unvaccinated.
[00:24:20.016 --> 00:24:27.018]  So bragging about how they like to have sex around the area where they defecate, oh, but they need you to be vaccinated to do it.
[00:24:27.038 --> 00:24:27.818]  But here's the kicker.
[00:24:28.418 --> 00:24:38.000]  It's all about these dominatrixes, as they call them, who dominate their sexual partners, saying they have to be vaccinated, and it's part of their dominatrix strategy to dominate them with the vaccine.
[00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:45.206]  Alex, this is the entire globalist paradigm boiled down into one perverted story.
[00:24:45.707 --> 00:24:48.269]  They are the dominatrix of culture.
[00:24:48.349 --> 00:24:50.191]  They're the dominatrix of society.
[00:24:50.451 --> 00:25:01.762]  They're the dominatrix of civilization wanting to dominate us with their vaccines in some sort of weird sexual torture masochism ritual and they don't even realize that
[00:25:02.142 --> 00:25:07.885]  This story in the Rolling Stone, meet the dominatrixes who are demanding their submissives get vaxxed.
[00:25:08.025 --> 00:25:08.565]  That's us!
[00:25:08.985 --> 00:25:11.027]  We're the submissives of the New World Order.
[00:25:11.547 --> 00:25:13.228]  Then you have a New York Times story.
[00:25:14.028 --> 00:25:16.189]  What's the best way to protect sex workers?
[00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:23.773]  And then it promotes and says it's a good thing for 13 year olds to be prostitutes.
[00:25:25.174 --> 00:25:27.175]  All in the news today, Alex.
[00:25:28.195 --> 00:25:28.996]  Absolutely, Owen.
[00:25:29.616 --> 00:25:31.657]  They call it their New World Order.
[00:25:32.416 --> 00:25:38.838]  And now when people come to the preschool and say, why are you teaching my three-year-old about how to give oral sex?
[00:25:39.398 --> 00:25:40.938]  They say, we're in a new world now.
[00:25:41.438 --> 00:25:49.280]  And so all these organizations and groups are just behaving in criminal action to overwhelm us and break our will right now and just bring this in.
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:53.061]  And absolutely, toilet play means they like to play with poop.
[00:25:53.661 --> 00:25:55.121]  So this is a religion.
[00:25:56.101 --> 00:25:58.182]  The media and the government are the high priest.
[00:25:59.358 --> 00:26:06.720]  And all the left that are in the religion and they take the sacrament that humans are dirty, humans are bad, and it's all a sick cult.
[00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:09.841]  These people have been turned over to a dark spiritual energy.
[00:26:10.261 --> 00:26:18.403]  I mean, if you randomly go to the Facebook or the Instagram pages of people posting that they got their shot, we're not editing these to find freaks.
[00:26:19.143 --> 00:26:25.425]  You go click on it, it looks like a giant spaceship with a million clowns landed or something.
[00:26:25.465 --> 00:26:26.825]  I mean, it looks like something out of a
[00:26:28.088 --> 00:26:33.550]  Rob Zombie Nightmare movie, you cannot copy this psychotic crazy look that they've got.
[00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:34.431]  You can't fake it.
[00:26:34.811 --> 00:26:36.672]  Why does Brian Stelter look like a satanic demon?
[00:26:36.952 --> 00:26:38.092]  Why is he so sanctimonious?
[00:26:38.132 --> 00:26:43.814]  Because that's the Joker-like spirit of these people and they want to watch the world burn.
[00:26:43.854 --> 00:26:47.816]  They want to pull it down while we're in straitjackets and can't resist them.
[00:26:47.876 --> 00:26:52.618]  So yes, this is a spiritual planetary demonic possession.
[00:26:52.658 --> 00:26:55.739]  Call it a radio channel, they tune us to, whatever you want to call it.
[00:26:56.363 --> 00:27:10.548]  Globalists are trying to forcibly force our consciousness down into this satanic bandwidth and fully control us because to them what Ed Buck did, Ed Buck's lawyer argued that him doing black magic rituals
[00:27:11.292 --> 00:27:14.295]  Trying to suck the spirits of black men was just a fun thing he did.
[00:27:14.655 --> 00:27:15.936]  It's okay that a couple of them died.
[00:27:16.356 --> 00:27:19.019]  That's actually in the LA Times today, during the trial.
[00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:21.741]  They're defending it as a lifestyle.
[00:27:22.161 --> 00:27:26.886]  He would get desperate black men who didn't want drugs and say, I'll give you $200 if you inject meth.
[00:27:27.346 --> 00:27:32.010]  He would then give them lethal doses of it to then give them other drugs to reanimate them.
[00:27:32.671 --> 00:27:35.573]  So, so, and he said, I'm doing a ritual to suck their energy.
[00:27:36.034 --> 00:27:38.396]  That's who these people are.
[00:27:38.456 --> 00:27:40.938]  And yes, they're sucking our energy in mass.
[00:27:40.958 --> 00:27:42.299]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[00:27:42.539 --> 00:27:44.661]  This is all a gigantic satanic ritual.
[00:27:45.891 --> 00:27:52.736]  And look at this exact quote, because this ties directly into Drag Queen Storytime and everything InfoWars has been warning you about.
[00:27:52.776 --> 00:27:54.297]  This is again from the New York Times.
[00:27:54.978 --> 00:27:57.380]  Candy first traded sex at age 13.
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:58.661]  Notice how they massage that.
[00:27:58.761 --> 00:27:59.702]  Oh, traded sex.
[00:28:00.282 --> 00:28:01.923]  No, no, she was made a sex slave.
[00:28:02.103 --> 00:28:03.725]  But oh, she traded sex, as they say.
[00:28:04.105 --> 00:28:07.688]  And then this is where it all ties into the Drag Queen Storytime pedophile time.
[00:28:08.388 --> 00:28:19.772]  To survive, she decided to lie about her age, taking refuge with a group of older transgender women, that's perverted pedophile men, who became her mentors.
[00:28:20.072 --> 00:28:22.553]  They taught her how to support herself through sex.
[00:28:23.393 --> 00:28:25.834]  And so, I mean, there it is all right there, Alex!
[00:28:26.234 --> 00:28:28.095]  They're coming out of the ground!
[00:28:28.335 --> 00:28:30.156]  They're crawling out of hell!
[00:28:30.176 --> 00:28:34.557]  I mean, this is the demonic, satanic takeover that we've been afraid of!
[00:28:35.797 --> 00:28:36.998]  Well, in Revelation it says,
[00:28:37.972 --> 00:28:45.154]  That the public will become like zombies, and that the gates of hell will be opened, and that they'll basically triple the demons on the earth that were everywhere.
[00:28:45.554 --> 00:28:47.995]  I think we're seeing the beginnings of this.
[00:28:48.295 --> 00:28:50.575]  Folks, you've seen nothing yet.
[00:28:51.656 --> 00:28:56.477]  It's going to be people with torches coming to your house, banging on the door, just like in Sodom and Gomorrah demanding your children.
[00:28:57.237 --> 00:28:58.637]  I mean, that is who they are.
[00:28:59.418 --> 00:29:00.298]  That is what they're doing.
[00:29:00.934 --> 00:29:04.797]  And it's happened in other cultures, it's happened in other societies, and it's why the societies fall.
[00:29:04.837 --> 00:29:14.065]  You can say it's spiritual, you can say it's something ingrained in our subconscious if you're a sick psychologist, but at the end of the day, how crazy is it, Owen?
[00:29:14.445 --> 00:29:18.008]  And thank God the listeners are keeping us on air and all the great affiliates, everybody, because we've been vindicated.
[00:29:18.549 --> 00:29:29.558]  How incredible is it that we're now living in the New World Order, still on air barely, the same Democratic Party law firm that has sued Remington into bankruptcy
[00:29:30.282 --> 00:29:34.923]  Remington offered them $33 million, even though they're bankrupt, because nobody really buys Remingtons anymore.
[00:29:34.943 --> 00:29:35.203]  The U.S.
[00:29:35.243 --> 00:29:36.203]  military doesn't buy them anymore.
[00:29:37.204 --> 00:29:46.946]  And they said, no, we want a billion dollars and $200 million for each family member, because Adam Lanza's mother gave him a semi-automatic rifle.
[00:29:47.086 --> 00:29:48.066]  It's Remington's fault.
[00:29:48.426 --> 00:29:55.528]  That's the same group suing us in key jurisdictions with the express goal of taking us off the air.
[00:29:55.948 --> 00:29:59.149]  See, they're going after the First Amendment and the Second Amendment, because once they've got that,
[00:29:59.995 --> 00:30:03.336]  Once they've got that, we're chained down under their control and they can go to work on us.
[00:30:04.396 --> 00:30:08.397]  And what's the common thread there with what we're seeing today from the medical tyranny?
[00:30:08.817 --> 00:30:25.880]  Big pharmaceutical drug manufacturers where, I mean, they don't give you the numbers because they don't want to talk about this in the news, but I mean, as far as we know, whenever we have the research done, every major mass shooter was on some form of major big pharmaceutical
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:28.901]  Psychotropic drugs, including Adam Lanza.
[00:30:29.121 --> 00:30:32.642]  You can see that the pills he was taking just sucked the soul out of him.
[00:30:32.662 --> 00:30:35.543]  He's just a mindless zombie because he's taking these pills all day.
[00:30:36.063 --> 00:30:41.004]  And it even says, as the side effects, suicidal thoughts, dangerous tendencies, all this stuff.
[00:30:41.304 --> 00:30:43.285]  And the media never reports on that angle.
[00:30:43.905 --> 00:30:44.665]  Same old why?
[00:30:44.965 --> 00:30:47.986]  Because the media is funded by big pharmaceutical drug manufacturers.
[00:30:48.006 --> 00:30:50.107]  I intend to make that... I mean, I don't want to give away everything, but...
[00:30:50.615 --> 00:30:51.936]  You know, the Lord works mysterious ways.
[00:30:51.976 --> 00:30:53.976]  That's all the information that's going to be coming out.
[00:30:54.096 --> 00:30:55.737]  And I'm going to have to leave it at that.
[00:30:56.237 --> 00:30:57.418]  And just a lot of other things that are going on.
[00:30:57.438 --> 00:31:00.959]  But yeah, it's the drug companies that are actually funding the anti-gun movement.
[00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:04.841]  Because they don't want their drugs to be blamed.
[00:31:05.121 --> 00:31:06.442]  They want to blame the inanimate tool.
[00:31:06.522 --> 00:31:08.783]  But let me just say this, and then I'm going to let you get back to your important work.
[00:31:09.803 --> 00:31:11.964]  History is happening now, right in front of us.
[00:31:13.172 --> 00:31:15.375]  And everybody's got to be more active now than ever.
[00:31:15.956 --> 00:31:20.321]  The globalist thought that they would have already gotten further in their plan, it's not going well for them.
[00:31:20.661 --> 00:31:24.666]  As bad as things look, as bleak as things are, it could be a lot
[00:31:25.336 --> 00:31:25.616]  Worse.
[00:31:25.716 --> 00:31:26.957]  We weren't supposed to be on air.
[00:31:27.097 --> 00:31:29.139]  Others weren't supposed to be on air at this point.
[00:31:29.199 --> 00:31:30.020]  We are on air.
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:32.361]  And people now know, wait, the vaccine doesn't work.
[00:31:32.441 --> 00:31:34.583]  Wait, people take the vaccine, spread it worse than others.
[00:31:34.643 --> 00:31:36.104]  Wait, I still got to wear a mask.
[00:31:36.164 --> 00:31:36.384]  Wait.
[00:31:36.985 --> 00:31:40.607]  And people know the politicians aren't following their own rules.
[00:31:40.928 --> 00:31:41.868]  They know it's all bull.
[00:31:42.329 --> 00:31:44.430]  And so this is really going to backfire on them.
[00:31:44.450 --> 00:31:49.134]  And that's why it's more important than ever to keep this broadcast on air.
[00:31:49.154 --> 00:31:51.876]  Folks, I've got a lot of plans, a lot of tricks up my sleeve.
[00:31:52.296 --> 00:31:53.557]  The enemy's got us under surveillance.
[00:31:54.375 --> 00:32:00.160]  But I don't want to give away some of this stuff on air, but believe me, believe me, imagine you got a big ship in the fight and you're in a big war.
[00:32:01.742 --> 00:32:05.105]  You got to have other ships ready in case one gets burned up and destroyed.
[00:32:05.125 --> 00:32:05.666]  That's fine.
[00:32:05.986 --> 00:32:11.371]  But they're going to be very, very frustrated if they ever think they're going to take out this Death Star that's blowing up their new order operations.
[00:32:11.791 --> 00:32:15.134]  But as soon as they blow this one up, three more come flying back around the other side of the planet.
[00:32:15.775 --> 00:32:17.897]  And so I'm just telling you folks, pray for us.
[00:32:18.988 --> 00:32:23.489]  Support us, but we are working around the clock in ways you don't even notify these people.
[00:32:23.569 --> 00:32:25.310]  I am working 18 hours a day.
[00:32:25.390 --> 00:32:25.950]  So is Owen.
[00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:26.570]  So is our crew.
[00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:31.692]  So I want to thank you all for defending us because we're doing this together.
[00:32:31.712 --> 00:32:32.392]  We're in this together.
[00:32:32.412 --> 00:32:37.034]  I want to encourage everybody to go to mcoleworkstore.com and get the X2 before it sells out to 50% off.
[00:32:37.394 --> 00:32:37.794]  How to get the
[00:32:38.726 --> 00:32:39.166]  We're good to go.
[00:33:08.135 --> 00:33:09.556]  And that's how we're funding the operation.
[00:33:10.376 --> 00:33:12.137]  Again, get books, get films, get t-shirts.
[00:33:13.618 --> 00:33:19.321]  All right, some final words from Alex Jones here before he says goodbye, and then we have some special reports.
[00:33:19.701 --> 00:33:21.202]  Alex, on the phone line, go ahead.
[00:33:22.643 --> 00:33:23.903]  Well, it's just this.
[00:33:24.343 --> 00:33:28.606]  I did shoot a very important special report where I coherently lay out the basic facts.
[00:33:28.626 --> 00:33:29.366]  We already did here today.
[00:33:29.386 --> 00:33:31.247]  It's going to air in the second, third segment that you're taking over.
[00:33:31.967 --> 00:33:35.849]  But listen, listeners, don't take info wars for granted.
[00:33:35.889 --> 00:33:36.950]  And I'm telling myself that.
[00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:45.573]  And the InfoWars is our listeners, InfoWars is our callers, it's our affiliates, it's our reporters, it's our guests, it's our hosts.
[00:33:46.153 --> 00:33:49.774]  This is such an important family, and I'm telling you, we've changed history together.
[00:33:50.135 --> 00:33:56.897]  So if we've been able to do this together, think what we can do in the future as our credibility explodes, okay?
[00:33:57.978 --> 00:34:04.200]  And as people begin to research themselves, don't just take this as stuff we claim, but go and find out for it for themselves.
[00:34:05.229 --> 00:34:08.631]  Evil has been building quietly and preparing for a long, long time.
[00:34:09.252 --> 00:34:10.252]  And now it's out in the open.
[00:34:10.792 --> 00:34:14.355]  It's launching its assault because we were taking the planet back from globalists.
[00:34:15.395 --> 00:34:21.118]  And there was a Christian awakening happening outside of the churches that frightened the system.
[00:34:21.799 --> 00:34:23.560]  So the enemy has completely uncloaked.
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:25.461]  But listen, if you're not a Christian, I'm not attacking you.
[00:34:25.501 --> 00:34:26.161]  I'm not judging you.
[00:34:26.662 --> 00:34:28.603]  I'm just saying there is good and evil in this universe.
[00:34:29.730 --> 00:34:31.491]  The Globalists are going after real Christians.
[00:34:31.571 --> 00:34:34.192]  Christianity predicted all of what's unfolding right now.
[00:34:34.552 --> 00:34:38.514]  And I'm just saying, good and evil is a very real thing.
[00:34:39.074 --> 00:34:40.295]  And here's the deal.
[00:34:41.035 --> 00:34:45.637]  Going along with the Globalists only makes you poorer and more unhappy and more pathetic.
[00:34:45.897 --> 00:34:49.939]  Why would anyone want to submit to them when everything they say is a lie and a fraud?
[00:34:50.559 --> 00:34:54.081]  They're doing this, again, to discredit our Republic.
[00:34:54.847 --> 00:34:57.069]  Blame America for what's about to happen worldwide.
[00:34:57.649 --> 00:35:02.913]  Blame the virus for the worldwide economic collapse that the globalists have engineered called the Great Reset.
[00:35:03.414 --> 00:35:05.175]  We have the enemy plans.
[00:35:06.016 --> 00:35:07.197]  We have their confessions.
[00:35:07.677 --> 00:35:09.078]  We have their future battle plans.
[00:35:09.158 --> 00:35:09.739]  And here's the deal.
[00:35:10.239 --> 00:35:11.140]  They're very OCD.
[00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:16.985]  Their criminals, especially mastermind types, are very methodical in their criminology.
[00:35:17.865 --> 00:35:20.287]  They are going to continue to execute the plans as they've been doing.
[00:35:20.948 --> 00:35:22.309]  That's why it's so easy to predict what they're going to do.
[00:35:22.879 --> 00:35:23.120]  Okay?
[00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:27.626]  And so, again, things are just going to get worse until we wake up and say no to this.
[00:35:27.706 --> 00:35:29.068]  This is a takeover plan.
[00:35:29.649 --> 00:35:30.770]  This is dehumanization.
[00:35:30.830 --> 00:35:31.912]  This is total enslavement.
[00:35:32.573 --> 00:35:39.803]  And now the fields in people's minds are fertile for planting seeds of truth and getting people to move and getting people to take action.
[00:35:40.934 --> 00:35:44.577]  Just last week, Oma's on air, and so was I, saying they're about to bring back the mask mandate.
[00:35:45.017 --> 00:35:50.001]  Then they're going to try to bring in a mandate and say, if you want to get on any airplanes, you've got to have an injection.
[00:35:50.482 --> 00:35:52.343]  And now, what is Biden saying?
[00:35:52.483 --> 00:35:54.245]  Just sit back and think about what they're saying.
[00:35:54.745 --> 00:36:02.351]  You must take an experimental shot, but they've lied to us about every front that's been linked to all these deaths and illnesses, where all the top scientists predicted it would cause blood clots.
[00:36:02.451 --> 00:36:02.871]  It does.
[00:36:03.252 --> 00:36:05.974]  Most of these vaccines are being pushed on us, are banned in other countries.
[00:36:06.594 --> 00:36:07.295]  I mean, this is incredible.
[00:36:07.867 --> 00:36:08.168]  I don't know.
[00:36:23.624 --> 00:36:24.985]  And we're gonna have to get aggressive.
[00:36:25.465 --> 00:36:26.665]  And I mean, get serious.
[00:36:26.685 --> 00:36:29.286]  And I mean, probably start blocking highways like Black Lives Matter does.
[00:36:29.326 --> 00:36:33.548]  Not get anybody killed, but, you know, have serious demonstrations to take over media events peacefully.
[00:36:33.848 --> 00:36:35.129]  To get up on stages live.
[00:36:35.669 --> 00:36:40.691]  To do whatever it takes, right to the edge of legality, to stop this from going to a shooting war.
[00:36:41.091 --> 00:36:43.792]  Because believe me, folks, listen to me carefully.
[00:36:44.272 --> 00:36:50.995]  They know, in their actuaries, in their battle plans, in their war games, that if they send out enough millions of contact tracers to the wrong houses and mess with the wrong people,
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.361]  That folks are going to get hurt.
[00:36:53.901 --> 00:36:54.502]  We don't want that.
[00:36:55.002 --> 00:36:59.325]  When they end up killing some of these contact tracers, they get aggressive because some of these are criminals that are getting hired.
[00:37:00.726 --> 00:37:05.489]  They're going to then start sending armed police and calling everybody that doesn't take the shots of the contact tracers terrorists.
[00:37:05.529 --> 00:37:06.210]  That's the next phase.
[00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:09.752]  They've already set up an official battle plan that I put out in June.
[00:37:10.132 --> 00:37:11.393]  We have the whole plan.
[00:37:12.013 --> 00:37:18.218]  And so we better get aggressive now ahead of that and say no lockdowns and no contact tracers and say we know your plan.
[00:37:18.538 --> 00:37:19.298]  We call you out.
[00:37:19.358 --> 00:37:20.079]  Bill Gass lied to us.
[00:37:20.119 --> 00:37:20.639]  It doesn't matter.
[00:37:20.899 --> 00:37:21.700]  The public's listening.
[00:37:22.512 --> 00:37:24.433]  We gotta go hardcore with the truth now, here's the good news.
[00:37:25.214 --> 00:37:28.816]  You watch Tucker Carlson, or you watch a lot of these shows now, it's not just like Alex Jones.
[00:37:28.836 --> 00:37:35.481]  It's not just they're copying me, they're going and checking everything I say and everything you say, and they're finding out it's true and they care about their families.
[00:37:35.821 --> 00:37:36.982]  So you tune in to Talk Radio now.
[00:37:38.061 --> 00:37:38.922]  Sounds like Alex Jones.
[00:37:38.942 --> 00:37:41.264]  You tune into all these shows, it sounds like Owen Schroer.
[00:37:41.324 --> 00:37:43.145]  Because we're all seeing the same thing.
[00:37:43.165 --> 00:37:43.946]  We're in this together.
[00:37:43.966 --> 00:37:45.187]  It's not about having the biggest show.
[00:37:45.207 --> 00:37:46.728]  It's not about being right.
[00:37:46.828 --> 00:37:49.050]  It's about defeating the New World Order for our children.
[00:37:49.511 --> 00:37:53.794]  Because yeah, you could say the average leftist is so corrupt and evil, let them take their shots and get sick and die.
[00:37:53.814 --> 00:37:56.196]  We're going to have to take care of the sick and dying liberals.
[00:37:56.216 --> 00:37:57.517]  We're going to have to collapse society.
[00:37:57.537 --> 00:37:58.458]  Plus, that's not Christ-like.
[00:37:58.678 --> 00:38:00.480]  But here's the real reason I'm sad for liberals.
[00:38:01.198 --> 00:38:05.061]  The children of these people, the two-year-olds, the five-year-olds, the ten-year-olds, they don't know any better.
[00:38:05.081 --> 00:38:07.382]  They're being born into bondage and brainwashing and evil.
[00:38:07.682 --> 00:38:08.443]  They're the real target.
[00:38:08.703 --> 00:38:13.586]  We have to take things back and be strong for the children or God is not going to respect us.
[00:38:13.826 --> 00:38:21.191]  And when we face God at the White Throne Judgment, God will say, I do not know you, because if you have God in you, you will burn with desire to stop this.
[00:38:21.432 --> 00:38:23.073]  You will be completely driven to stop this.
[00:38:23.353 --> 00:38:24.514]  People ask how I have so much energy.
[00:38:24.574 --> 00:38:29.957]  My God, satanic, total world government takeover, forced inoculations, run by pedophiles.
[00:38:29.997 --> 00:38:30.798]  What the hell, people?
[00:38:31.398 --> 00:38:32.821]  We don't have much time to stop this.
[00:38:32.881 --> 00:38:34.103]  This is serious business.
[00:38:34.423 --> 00:38:36.446]  So go rebuke your churches when they don't talk about this.
[00:38:36.646 --> 00:38:37.668]  Go rebuke your schools.
[00:38:37.888 --> 00:38:39.811]  When they try to put masks on your kids, pull them out of there.
[00:38:40.232 --> 00:38:41.233]  Stop complying.
[00:38:41.273 --> 00:38:42.255]  Compliance is death.
[00:38:42.716 --> 00:38:44.118]  Owen Takeover, I love you and I love the crew.
[00:38:45.342 --> 00:38:53.868]  All right, Alex, and we'll be hearing again from Alex coming up in the next hour with a special report that he has booked and tried to get some R&R on your vacation.
[00:38:53.928 --> 00:38:54.989]  Please, Alex, we beg you.
[00:38:55.709 --> 00:38:56.530]  Lord knows you need it.
[00:38:57.210 --> 00:39:12.660]  And, you know, let me just say this, too, as Alex said at the beginning of this segment, because, I mean, again, we don't even think about it this way, but we pretty much laid out exactly what they were going to do.
[00:39:13.919 --> 00:39:26.783]  I mean, hell, I literally laid out exactly what they were going to do, just like you saw the clips from Alex Jones at the beginning of the broadcast, and I said, they're going to tell you the hospitals are overwhelmed, they're going to bring back the mask mandates, then they're going to mandate the vaccines.
[00:39:26.943 --> 00:39:27.623]  They've done all of it.
[00:39:28.743 --> 00:39:34.865]  And the fact that they did it a lot sooner than I thought they did tells me that they're not going to get the FDA approval that they want.
[00:39:35.585 --> 00:39:41.247]  For whatever reason, the FDA seems to want to keep its hands clean of this vaccine.
[00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:46.493]  So maybe it's people at the FDA like, you know what, I don't want this blood on my hands.
[00:39:47.074 --> 00:39:51.498]  Maybe for the first time in decades, the FDA actually cares about the American people and doesn't want to poison them.
[00:39:52.218 --> 00:40:01.867]  But the fact that they're announcing mandatory vaccines in New York, mandatory vaccines in California, mandatory vaccines for government workers ordered by the White House.
[00:40:03.088 --> 00:40:09.493]  The fact that they basically sped through their hospitals are overwhelmed narrative
[00:40:10.578 --> 00:40:24.645]  To get to the forced mask mandates, to now get ready to tell you that, oh no, everybody's going to have to get a vaccine, it's going to be mandatory without the FDA approval, that means that they are really not banking on that FDA approval.
[00:40:24.665 --> 00:40:26.146]  Again, I'm stunned by that.
[00:40:26.646 --> 00:40:28.387]  We know this whole thing has been planned out.
[00:40:28.867 --> 00:40:31.468]  We know the FDA is just as corrupt as the CDC.
[00:40:32.209 --> 00:40:38.352]  But for whatever reason, it seems like the FDA wants to keep its hands clear of this vaccine.
[00:40:40.086 --> 00:40:46.431]  So they just went ahead and put it into high gear and said, well, okay, maybe we're not going to get FDA approval when we want.
[00:40:46.471 --> 00:40:48.452]  So let's just go ahead and just mandate the vaccines anyway.
[00:40:48.732 --> 00:40:50.274]  Nobody's heard of the Nuremberg Code.
[00:40:50.714 --> 00:40:52.595]  Nobody understands that these are experimental.
[00:40:52.896 --> 00:40:53.956]  So let's just go ahead and do it.
[00:40:54.196 --> 00:40:57.059]  And people are so stupid and brainwashed that they're just going to go along with it.
[00:40:57.079 --> 00:41:01.542]  And now we have total tyranny, medical tyranny, total imprisonment and slavery worldwide.
[00:41:01.562 --> 00:41:02.343]  So that's where they're going.
[00:41:02.383 --> 00:41:06.045]  But see, here's the frustrating thing.
[00:41:07.646 --> 00:41:07.907]  You know,
[00:41:09.738 --> 00:41:21.265]  People are born, or we're trained, we are trained in America, mainstream media and entertainment and everything, to exist or understand the sports matrix.
[00:41:22.906 --> 00:41:28.329]  So you can be watching a football game on, you know, Sunday afternoon and the top
[00:41:29.622 --> 00:41:57.498]  Color commentary guy for NFL football games say it's Tony Romo and he can be sitting there and say okay the offense is in an I formation and the back just moved to the right and that means they're gonna run a play-action fake to the right and roll out to the left and throw the ball deep downfield and get the first down and then they snap the ball the guy goes to the right they roll out to the left throws the ball downfield caught by the receiver first down and you're like wow
[00:41:58.803 --> 00:41:59.144]  Wow!
[00:41:59.265 --> 00:42:00.990]  Tony Romo must see the future!
[00:42:01.010 --> 00:42:03.016]  He must be a genius!
[00:42:03.056 --> 00:42:03.939]  How did he do that?
[00:42:05.416 --> 00:42:05.716]  No.
[00:42:06.536 --> 00:42:07.957]  He knows the playbook.
[00:42:08.017 --> 00:42:09.937]  He exists in football.
[00:42:09.977 --> 00:42:10.818]  He played football.
[00:42:10.858 --> 00:42:12.078]  He lives in the football world.
[00:42:12.158 --> 00:42:15.439]  So he just sees the play that they've ran 30 times.
[00:42:16.179 --> 00:42:17.700]  He knows what their playbook is.
[00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:20.060]  He's seen them run it in practice.
[00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:21.441]  He's seen them run it in the game.
[00:42:21.721 --> 00:42:23.941]  So he just says, here's the play they're about to run.
[00:42:24.161 --> 00:42:24.982]  Let's watch them run it.
[00:42:25.002 --> 00:42:25.662]  And then they run it.
[00:42:25.822 --> 00:42:27.042]  And there's no miracle.
[00:42:27.082 --> 00:42:28.363]  There's no mystery to that.
[00:42:28.443 --> 00:42:32.444]  That's just a guy that lives in the sports matrix and understands what play they're about to run.
[00:42:34.252 --> 00:42:35.993]  That's what we do here at InfoWars.
[00:42:38.035 --> 00:42:43.360]  It's not a miracle or a crystal ball for us to come up here and predict all this stuff.
[00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:58.172]  But because people don't exist in the geopolitical matrix and they're not trained to understand the geopolitical matrix, it seems like magic that InfoWars can predict all this stuff decades or years or months or weeks or days in advance.
[00:42:59.397 --> 00:43:07.675]  Folks, we just see the pattern, know the playbook, know the operating procedure, and it's really not even that difficult.
[00:43:10.856 --> 00:43:12.457]  So, understand that.
[00:43:12.517 --> 00:43:14.799]  We're not getting lucky guessing these things.
[00:43:15.579 --> 00:43:17.020]  It's not a miracle.
[00:43:18.461 --> 00:43:27.228]  They're running a play, they're running a formation, they're running an agenda, and we just know what it is, so it's easy to call out and say, oh, there it is!
[00:43:27.888 --> 00:43:31.371]  There they are, they're about to bring back the masks, and then they do it, because it's the play!
[00:43:32.531 --> 00:43:38.035]  Think about how diabolical the CDC is, where on the same day,
[00:43:40.526 --> 00:43:51.974]  They admit that the vaccinated people are the ones causing the outbreak, and the vaccinated people are the ones causing the mutations of the COVID virus to make it more deadly.
[00:43:52.134 --> 00:43:53.775]  That's the CDC announcing it.
[00:43:54.576 --> 00:44:03.202]  CDC director now says new data shows breakthrough cases in vaccinated people can spread as much as virus as unvaccinated.
[00:44:06.892 --> 00:44:12.256]  And then they come out and say, but we need vaccine passports, that's the only path forward.
[00:44:12.316 --> 00:44:23.364]  So, they admit the vaccine is not effective, they admit the vaccine is causing the spread to be worse, and then they come out and say the only answer is the vaccine.
[00:44:24.585 --> 00:44:28.128]  And that's Rochelle Walensky at the CDC.
[00:44:28.588 --> 00:44:29.689]  And then they even have
[00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:39.783]  They even have the cojones to come out and say, well, we're going to do the masks again, but it's only going to be two weeks.
[00:44:40.803 --> 00:44:42.063]  Two weeks to slow the spread.
[00:44:42.083 --> 00:44:43.644]  What was that, a year and a half ago?
[00:44:46.085 --> 00:44:47.605]  When does the pandemic ever end?
[00:44:47.765 --> 00:44:48.506]  Well, it never ends.
[00:44:49.386 --> 00:44:49.906]  Don't you see?
[00:44:50.706 --> 00:44:52.947]  The pandemic never ends.
[00:44:53.807 --> 00:45:00.170]  And for politicians and government bureaucrats, they love the pandemic because it gives them more power.
[00:45:01.554 --> 00:45:15.220]  And I guess to the brainwashed minions of the mainstream media and the Democrat Party, I guess they just like going along with the pandemic because even in their tiny little worthless lives, they feel that it gives them power over you.
[00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:18.081]  Oh, they can bitch at you if you don't get a vaccine.
[00:45:18.602 --> 00:45:20.502]  Oh, they can bitch at you if you don't wear a mask.
[00:45:20.582 --> 00:45:23.084]  And that's the greatest joy of their day.
[00:45:25.632 --> 00:45:28.094]  They love telling you to wear the mask.
[00:45:28.815 --> 00:45:31.737]  They love telling you to take that vaccine.
[00:45:34.219 --> 00:45:35.400]  So that's their empowerment.
[00:45:36.981 --> 00:45:38.162]  That's why they go along with it.
[00:45:38.622 --> 00:45:40.764]  They don't care that it's enslaving and killing them.
[00:45:41.865 --> 00:45:52.914]  They get empowered by it because they'd rather have that excuse to go out and dominate you than actually be free or stand up for freedom and truth themselves.
[00:45:55.962 --> 00:45:57.303]  CBS Sacramento.
[00:45:58.043 --> 00:46:02.426]  Higher COVID rate found in some counties with higher vaccination rate.
[00:46:03.047 --> 00:46:03.347]  Yep.
[00:46:04.487 --> 00:46:04.888]  Yep.
[00:46:05.728 --> 00:46:15.214]  And remember, we had the doctors on over a year ago, and just consistently since then, all saying the same thing.
[00:46:16.615 --> 00:46:21.118]  If they roll out a vaccine for this, it's going to cause worse mutations.
[00:46:21.378 --> 00:46:22.259]  And now it is.
[00:46:24.867 --> 00:46:45.595]  Israel is a perfect example, and we covered it yesterday, how the CDC and the White House launch a travel advisory, or announce a travel advisory from Israel, stage three, saying Israel's got way too big of an outbreak of COVID and Delta, so we're stopping anybody coming in from Israel.
[00:46:46.255 --> 00:46:51.897]  And then in the same interview, or the same announcement, they say, but we need to
[00:46:53.516 --> 00:46:56.439]  Do the exact same vaccine distribution that Israel had.
[00:46:56.679 --> 00:47:05.107]  So they admit the vaccine doesn't work, they admit Israel has a horrible outbreak, and they ban travel from Israel, but then they say Israel's done a good job with the vaccines.
[00:47:07.009 --> 00:47:16.358]  Now, that's not even to mention the tremendous irony that the southern border is just wide open.
[00:47:19.034 --> 00:47:22.796]  And I've got another news story on that today too.
[00:47:23.737 --> 00:47:33.082]  La Jolla police say hotel is housing migrants with COVID-19 released by Border Patrol and the police chief comes out in a press conference and says we had no idea that this was going on.
[00:47:35.984 --> 00:47:37.285]  Does somebody want to tell him?
[00:47:38.805 --> 00:47:39.766]  Does anybody want to tell him?
[00:47:43.044 --> 00:47:44.645]  Hey, buddy, I got bad news for you.
[00:47:45.306 --> 00:47:52.570]  There's dozens of hotels on the southern border of Texas that are filled with illegal immigrants that have COVID.
[00:47:53.511 --> 00:47:55.852]  And this has been going on for months.
[00:47:56.453 --> 00:47:59.515]  So hate to break it to you, bud, but we covered that months ago.
[00:48:02.079 --> 00:48:04.380]  Humanity is being held hostage.
[00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:10.782]  A worldwide medical tyranny, controlled by the Fortune 500 and the UN, is being permanently put in place.
[00:48:11.422 --> 00:48:17.204]  We must resist its criminal establishment of global dominance, or we will be slaves for generations.
[00:48:17.464 --> 00:48:20.025]  And more importantly, our children will be slaves.
[00:48:20.485 --> 00:48:22.065]  We are now at the crossroads.
[00:48:28.207 --> 00:48:30.348]  What have I told you that you could predict the future?
[00:48:31.462 --> 00:48:32.623]  What have I proved to you?
[00:48:33.304 --> 00:48:36.246]  That if you do the right research, you can predict the future.
[00:48:36.586 --> 00:48:39.008]  And more importantly, you can change the future.
[00:48:39.028 --> 00:48:40.329]  You don't need a mask.
[00:48:40.349 --> 00:48:41.771]  The mask is about compliance.
[00:48:41.991 --> 00:48:44.073]  Because they know Canadians like to do what they're told.
[00:48:44.373 --> 00:48:45.874]  So they tell you, you have to wear a mask.
[00:48:46.214 --> 00:48:48.036]  Next, they're going to tell you, you have to contact trace.
[00:48:48.416 --> 00:48:50.378]  Then they're going to tell you, you have to take the vaccine.
[00:48:50.678 --> 00:48:54.201]  And because Canadians like to do what they're told, they're hoping that everyone just complies.
[00:48:54.481 --> 00:48:55.522]  And then guess what, kids?
[00:48:55.903 --> 00:48:59.666]  Once you take your vaccine, like a dumb person that doesn't know any better,
[00:49:00.166 --> 00:49:11.874]  They're gonna tell you, sorry, the vaccine isn't as effective as we thought it was gonna be, so now you still gotta wear your mask, still gotta get contact trace, still have all the restrictions and social distancing, and still take your vaccine.
[00:49:12.154 --> 00:49:13.555]  And then what did you get out of all of this?
[00:49:13.935 --> 00:49:21.160]  You got a whole year where you weren't allowed to travel, your business was closed, they took your rights and freedoms, they forced the vaccine on you, and...
[00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:22.420]  What happened?
[00:49:22.741 --> 00:49:32.127]  The same amount of people died, everything is the exact same, and now they're gonna put you back on lockdown and bring it all the way till July of next year so they can do the same thing again!
[00:49:32.508 --> 00:49:38.191]  Bring you from July, August, and September, getting you off lockdown, but just to bring you back on lockdown again.
[00:49:38.212 --> 00:49:40.153]  If you idiots haven't figured it out yet...
[00:49:40.553 --> 00:49:43.474]  It's a perpetual cycle that you never get out of.
[00:49:43.754 --> 00:49:48.415]  And it's a way to take your rights, your freedoms, close your business, take your wealth.
[00:49:48.715 --> 00:49:48.975]  Why?
[00:49:49.075 --> 00:49:50.676]  So you become dependent on government.
[00:49:51.076 --> 00:49:51.376]  Why?
[00:49:51.396 --> 00:49:54.777]  If you're independent, the government works for you like it's supposed to.
[00:49:55.117 --> 00:50:04.119]  If you depend on the government to give you a paycheck to feed your family every month, because they closed your business on you, now the government doesn't work for you, the government rules you.
[00:50:04.499 --> 00:50:08.400]  So instead of a middle class, we have the government, upper class,
[00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:12.262]  And the lower class dependents that rely on the government to survive.
[00:50:12.603 --> 00:50:14.504]  In other words, we have a slave class.
[00:50:15.104 --> 00:50:16.705]  The clip you just saw is from a year ago.
[00:50:16.765 --> 00:50:18.667]  It's Canadian activist Chris Sky.
[00:50:19.347 --> 00:50:23.410]  How was he able to specifically, exactly predict what would happen?
[00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:28.173]  And in the longer video, he specifically even predicted the time frames in which it would happen.
[00:50:28.893 --> 00:50:33.977]  Months and months before Chris Sky made his prediction, I made my own predictions that came 100% true.
[00:50:34.177 --> 00:50:35.277]  We'll play that clip in a few minutes.
[00:50:35.758 --> 00:50:37.079]  Again, how was I able to do that?
[00:50:37.796 --> 00:50:40.739]  Because the globalists do control the planet to a great extent.
[00:50:40.959 --> 00:50:42.841]  They set worldwide policy.
[00:50:43.542 --> 00:50:45.845]  I can't predict when my neighbor's going to have a heart attack.
[00:50:45.885 --> 00:50:50.850]  I can't predict if your fifth grader is going to break their arm in the next year falling out of a tree.
[00:50:51.631 --> 00:50:53.232]  Because those are little micro events.
[00:50:54.013 --> 00:51:05.378]  But when you talk about the big, giant events, the globalists really are in control of this planet, and we had all the documents and all the admissions from the United Nations and the Davos Group from Klaus Schwab on their plan.
[00:51:05.998 --> 00:51:16.943]  They said once they got one lockdown in, they would then lighten the lockdown only to bring it back, and over time, tighten it down more and more and more until there were no freedoms left.
[00:51:17.816 --> 00:51:18.577]  And now they've come out.
[00:51:19.217 --> 00:51:43.276]  As of yesterday, the CDC, run by all the big Bill Gates and Fauci money, and have said, you are going to have to wear masks basically forever, children, everybody else, and those that have been supposedly vaccinated against COVID-19 with these experimental shots, you are just as likely to transmit it to others, maybe even more likely to transmit new variants to others.
[00:51:43.816 --> 00:51:46.879]  How do you turn the entire planet Earth into a prison planet?
[00:51:47.967 --> 00:51:50.628]  You simply declare having a cold an act of terrorism.
[00:51:51.129 --> 00:51:51.949]  And they're saying that now.
[00:51:51.989 --> 00:51:55.311]  They're saying if you're not inoculated with this experimental shot, you're like a drunk driver.
[00:51:55.471 --> 00:51:56.292]  You're like a murderer.
[00:51:56.492 --> 00:51:57.372]  You're like a terrorist.
[00:51:57.932 --> 00:52:03.315]  And now Microsoft is putting out video games called Stay Homer, where the Chinese military and the U.S.
[00:52:03.335 --> 00:52:09.559]  military go around and kill peaceful protests, men, women, and children, because they're terrorists and super spreaders?
[00:52:10.279 --> 00:52:20.047]  This is the pretext to track and control you via a phone, via an app, that then becomes the cashless society and the worldwide program for the social credit score.
[00:52:20.107 --> 00:52:21.068]  And it's now official.
[00:52:21.728 --> 00:52:32.937]  And thousands of companies across the United States are now saying, you're not coming into our business, you're not coming into our hotel, you're not coming into our restaurant, you're not coming into this area unless you have had this
[00:52:33.678 --> 00:52:40.427]  Injection into your body and then it's expanding to other corporations, other businesses, and Biden's looking at mandating it for all federal employees.
[00:52:40.987 --> 00:52:41.828]  You can't do that.
[00:52:42.489 --> 00:52:47.836]  You can't mandate an approved FDA shot with all their problems in history in the federal law and Nuremberg Code.
[00:52:47.996 --> 00:52:49.197]  But this is experimental.
[00:52:49.963 --> 00:52:54.465]  This violates the very heart of the Nuremberg Code and our own federal and state laws.
[00:52:54.525 --> 00:52:58.746]  So we're at the crossroads and they've lied to us at every step of the way.
[00:52:58.986 --> 00:53:00.947]  They're now saying you got to wear masks forever.
[00:53:01.487 --> 00:53:05.188]  They're now saying, sorry, the vaccines don't work, but you got to have more vaccines.
[00:53:05.908 --> 00:53:09.390]  And people that have had the vaccines are just as likely or more so to give it to you.
[00:53:09.990 --> 00:53:12.711]  Oh, but then those that don't take it, you're even worse terrorist.
[00:53:13.111 --> 00:53:14.931]  You shouldn't have a job or even have your children.
[00:53:14.971 --> 00:53:16.052]  That's Kathleen Sebelius.
[00:53:17.032 --> 00:53:18.893]  Obama's former Health and Human Services head.
[00:53:19.274 --> 00:53:40.729]  This is all being announced by the megacorporations and by the blue cities and the blue states and other globalist enclaves around the world to hold humanity hostage and make us accept a worldwide ID tracking system on our phones which Klaus Schwab and the UN admit under the social credit score that they want to announce by next year
[00:53:41.870 --> 00:53:49.375]  We'll track everywhere you go and what you do and every purchase you make and put it into your carbon score and tax you according to how much carbon you use.
[00:53:50.096 --> 00:53:51.917]  So this is the endgame.
[00:53:52.437 --> 00:53:54.639]  Everything from this point on goes over the edge of a cliff.
[00:53:54.719 --> 00:53:56.420]  Everything accelerates now.
[00:53:57.281 --> 00:53:58.962]  This is all classically illegal.
[00:53:59.262 --> 00:54:00.503]  It's all classic tyranny.
[00:54:01.263 --> 00:54:02.484]  It's incredibly dangerous.
[00:54:02.964 --> 00:54:09.389]  And we need governors and legislatures and pastors and business owners and citizens to come up with a plan.
[00:54:10.362 --> 00:54:18.768]  Maybe an upside down flag of America or something because we are in distress and that upside down flag means we understand what's going on.
[00:54:18.809 --> 00:54:27.055]  We understand humanity's under siege and we understand this is all a scam and a fraud and a crisis they've created that's impossible to get out of.
[00:54:27.355 --> 00:54:28.976]  Because there's always going to be new flu viruses.
[00:54:29.196 --> 00:54:30.798]  There's always going to be new cold viruses.
[00:54:30.978 --> 00:54:32.739]  There's always going to be new coronaviruses.
[00:54:32.999 --> 00:54:36.022]  There's always going to be labs run by Fauci with new stuff to release.
[00:54:36.442 --> 00:54:44.929]  And now they've trained us to get on our knees and say that we're non-essential and go into our homes and just sit there while the Amazons and the Walmarts and the Targets take over.
[00:54:45.309 --> 00:54:46.610]  Because there's also that incentive.
[00:54:47.511 --> 00:54:48.692]  Depending on the corporation,
[00:54:49.639 --> 00:54:55.242]  The Fortune 100, during the last year and a half of global lockdowns, doubled their profits.
[00:54:55.702 --> 00:54:59.224]  Some of them doubled their overall stock value, and some tripled it.
[00:54:59.865 --> 00:55:04.867]  I mean, we're talking companies making hundreds of billions of dollars extra each.
[00:55:05.308 --> 00:55:13.452]  We're talking CEOs and owners whose wealth went up 50, 60, 70 billion a piece, because they're set up in the infrastructure to keep operating.
[00:55:13.492 --> 00:55:14.093]  They're essential.
[00:55:14.513 --> 00:55:18.215]  They have the supply chains, but your small business, your community, your church,
[00:55:19.599 --> 00:55:20.140]  We're good to go.
[00:55:30.089 --> 00:55:33.610]  Take all these shots, you won't have a job, you won't get your welfare check.
[00:55:33.650 --> 00:55:35.170]  I mean, it's not coming, it's here.
[00:55:35.930 --> 00:55:39.111]  And how many times did I warn you over and over and over again?
[00:55:39.931 --> 00:55:43.012]  Because, again, it's in Operation Lockstep.
[00:55:43.112 --> 00:55:45.213]  It's in all their documents.
[00:55:45.533 --> 00:55:47.693]  They think we're so stupid they lay all this out.
[00:55:48.113 --> 00:55:50.054]  And really, if humanity puts up with this,
[00:55:50.914 --> 00:55:52.995]  Don't we really deserve then what happens to us?
[00:55:53.695 --> 00:56:04.318]  So yes, adults that go along with this and who don't care and who are so stupid win the Darwin Awards and deserve to be basically killed by these poison injections that we now know are designed to cause blood clots all over the body.
[00:56:04.939 --> 00:56:05.959]  But you know who doesn't deserve it?
[00:56:06.059 --> 00:56:06.599]  The children.
[00:56:07.219 --> 00:56:09.580]  The one-year-olds, the five-year-olds, the six-year-olds, the ten-year-olds.
[00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:15.162]  It's up to us to protect them and to lead them to the truth.
[00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:31.656]  And we have a responsibility, all of us, to start having a discussion about what do we do when the globalists are casting us as the criminals, casting us as the dirty humans that gotta cover our ugly faces and that are germ spreaders, when all the studies show that 99% of the time our germs sharing makes us healthier.
[00:56:31.676 --> 00:56:34.720]  And if you're not exposed to other people's germs, you get sick and die.
[00:56:36.468 --> 00:56:37.388]  That's the real science.
[00:56:37.428 --> 00:56:39.929]  But see, they say, oh no, there's new science out.
[00:56:39.949 --> 00:56:43.010]  Psaki said, that's why you've now got to wear a mask.
[00:56:43.050 --> 00:56:44.271]  And that's why the vaccines don't work.
[00:56:44.311 --> 00:56:45.011]  But they still work.
[00:56:45.031 --> 00:56:45.791]  You've got to take them.
[00:56:46.551 --> 00:56:55.614]  Science is about asking questions, not having a scientific dictatorship of corporations bully and control all the real doctors and scientists who, by the way, are saying the opposite of what they're saying.
[00:56:56.295 --> 00:56:59.796]  I'm saying what all the real scientists and experts and Nobel Prize winners are saying.
[00:57:00.236 --> 00:57:00.616]  All of them.
[00:57:00.656 --> 00:57:01.136]  It's crazy.
[00:57:01.436 --> 00:57:02.997]  I'm actually proud of the scientific community.
[00:57:03.757 --> 00:57:13.660]  But you have the globalists, the big corporations that have hijacked that community and are now taking over with a medical dictatorship the world economy and where we can go and what we can do and locking us in our homes.
[00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:20.482]  If a foreign enemy came and took over the United States and then ordered us to stay in our homes at night, we wouldn't put up with that.
[00:57:21.062 --> 00:57:25.443]  But when the UN and the big corporations do it, in the name of this virus they cooked up, we do do it.
[00:57:26.203 --> 00:57:29.684]  You never get out of this type of control by bowing down.
[00:57:30.104 --> 00:57:33.025]  You only get out of it by saying no and rebuking it and exposing it.
[00:57:34.349 --> 00:57:42.953]  We either expose and prosecute the ringleaders of this, Bill Gates, Fauci, and others, or they're going to continue to expand this program.
[00:57:43.093 --> 00:57:44.934]  And that's the most important thing I'm going to say here today.
[00:57:45.674 --> 00:57:49.116]  Just like Domino's, we know what's coming next in our plan.
[00:57:50.496 --> 00:57:54.298]  And that's going to be new, even more hardcore viruses they're going to release.
[00:57:55.819 --> 00:57:57.880]  To see if we'll stay in our homes and quietly die.
[00:57:57.900 --> 00:58:09.265]  It's going to be the third world collapsing because of the ongoing lockdowns that are now in place and the UN organizing hundreds of millions of people, which they say they're going to bring here to flood the United States and Europe as a political tool to bring us to our knees.
[00:58:10.185 --> 00:58:21.470]  It's going to mean contact tracers coming to your house, demanding to come in your home with armed police, and then taking you away to emergency COVID centers, even if you've tested negative on their fraudulent machines.
[00:58:22.190 --> 00:58:26.175]  And yes, it means COVID camps for people who refuse the inoculation.
[00:58:26.435 --> 00:58:27.636]  It's being announced in the UK.
[00:58:27.797 --> 00:58:28.798]  It's being announced in Israel.
[00:58:28.998 --> 00:58:30.039]  It's being announced in Australia.
[00:58:30.239 --> 00:58:33.483]  And they're now even beginning to do it in places of Northern Europe.
[00:58:33.884 --> 00:58:35.806]  We shot a big report on that with witnesses yesterday.
[00:58:35.826 --> 00:58:37.047]  That's at Bandot Video.
[00:58:37.992 --> 00:58:40.995]  So this thing just gets worse and worse and worse the more we submit.
[00:58:41.576 --> 00:58:44.319]  And each new stage of the program is completely obvious.
[00:58:44.799 --> 00:58:48.203]  Just like we told you they're going to blame the unvaccinated when the vaccine doesn't work.
[00:58:48.764 --> 00:58:50.225]  How did we say that over a year ago?
[00:58:50.546 --> 00:58:52.928]  Because we know the enemy plan.
[00:58:52.948 --> 00:58:59.415]  I'm going to shoot another report this afternoon that's going to detail what the world will look like in two years
[00:59:00.336 --> 00:59:03.257]  If we don't start turning the tide back now and saying no.
[00:59:03.957 --> 00:59:10.939]  So to all the legislatures and all the corporate owners who aren't globalists, and everybody out there who thinks you're safe on the fence, you're not safe on the fence.
[00:59:11.259 --> 00:59:12.600]  You got to get off the fence now.
[00:59:12.660 --> 00:59:18.541]  This is a very cancerous, hardcore, authoritarian world government takeover plan that has been well thought out.
[00:59:18.622 --> 00:59:19.922]  But if you were awake to the plan,
[00:59:20.542 --> 00:59:27.905]  And awake to how it operates, it's very easy to defeat if people simply, again, awaken and start resisting it in nonviolent ways.
[00:59:28.325 --> 00:59:31.007]  The problem is they're assaulting us physically with these deadly shots.
[00:59:31.627 --> 00:59:33.588]  They're violating our rights, trying to coerce us to take them.
[00:59:34.208 --> 00:59:36.089]  And so we do have a right to defend ourselves.
[00:59:36.629 --> 00:59:38.130]  And I'm not calling for violence right now.
[00:59:38.250 --> 00:59:43.212]  I'm just simply saying that we're entering a wheelhouse where the gloves are off.
[00:59:44.329 --> 00:59:50.915]  I don't want any violence because they're probably going to stage false flags against themselves to make the whole medical tyranny group look like victims.
[00:59:52.616 --> 00:59:57.781]  That's why they've gotten the new Homeland Security report put out two months ago by Biden that anyone that's against lockdowns is a terrorist.
[00:59:58.281 --> 01:00:08.951]  They're already branding us as terrorists as they kill us, as they poison us, as they lock us up, as they say we're not essential, as they rob us, as they implode us, as they impoverish us through economic and cultural warfare.
[01:00:09.531 --> 01:00:15.895]  So we have to be like Gandhi and Jesus Christ and Martin Luther King and point that out to the public and be peaceful.
[01:00:16.355 --> 01:00:23.039]  But also point out that once we take the government back, there will be trials just like Nuremberg for the individuals that did this and they will pay.
[01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:25.381]  It's very important for the globalists to be uncomfortable.
[01:00:26.061 --> 01:00:28.423]  It's very important for them to know that they will be held accountable.
[01:00:28.723 --> 01:00:31.585]  It's very important for them to know that we're aware of their plan.
[01:00:32.205 --> 01:00:34.485]  The only way we can counter this evil is if you take action.
[01:00:34.866 --> 01:00:37.426]  You aren't just part of the equation, you are basically the entire equation.
[01:00:37.446 --> 01:00:41.587]  You know the old saying, if a tree falls in the forest and nobody's there to hear it, did it make a sound?
[01:00:42.087 --> 01:00:44.247]  It's up to you to take this report and get it out.
[01:00:44.267 --> 01:00:46.428]  This is a life and death situation.
[01:00:46.748 --> 01:00:48.348]  Things are deteriorating very, very fast.
[01:00:49.008 --> 01:00:52.509]  We've now confirmed that this is their most vicious takeover plan that they've launched.
[01:00:53.149 --> 01:00:56.130]  And all I can say is you better get right with God as well and take action while you still can.
[01:00:56.837 --> 01:01:04.307]  They have never guessed the right flu virus for the mutation of what the main flu is the next year, and it's always a whole bunch of flus, dozens and dozens of them.
[01:01:04.948 --> 01:01:09.594]  And that it does nothing to protect you from the next flu if it's not the exact flu!
[01:01:11.738 --> 01:01:14.480]  That's why they never ask why they don't have a vaccine for the common cold.
[01:01:14.801 --> 01:01:15.922]  Because it's too varied.
[01:01:16.242 --> 01:01:17.403]  Because there's thousands of them.
[01:01:17.703 --> 01:01:19.685]  And because you have to get it exactly right.
[01:01:19.945 --> 01:01:21.407]  And viruses are always mutating.
[01:01:21.567 --> 01:01:23.409]  But you notice they're telling you they've got a vaccine.
[01:01:23.749 --> 01:01:27.072]  They want you willingly to go take whatever it is that's gonna be in there.
[01:01:27.552 --> 01:01:37.942]  Now Fauci has come out of you, just joined us, we're gonna play the clip again first here in a moment, and said, hey, we're gonna surveil people, we're gonna cycle into other seasons, next year you won't be able to go out either.
[01:01:39.218 --> 01:01:46.503]  So they'll run into the middle of summer, and then let you have a month or two, and then clamp it back down, but there'll be special apps they're announcing, you'll be tracked, China was the model.
[01:01:47.583 --> 01:01:50.225]  They're gonna roll it out like they just got these ideas, but it's all pre-planned.
[01:01:51.206 --> 01:01:59.511]  By the Rockefeller Foundation, Bill and Melinda Gates, the tabletop exercises, predicting COVID-19 in November when it was already launched in China.
[01:01:59.771 --> 01:02:07.336]  I think all of you already instinctively know this is the big one, and if we fail this test, we're gonna be ruled by the threat
[01:02:08.803 --> 01:02:11.768]  Unending invisible bio weapons.
[01:02:11.788 --> 01:02:17.998]  They're gonna tighten down the restrictions loosen them by the summer and then release new strains.
[01:02:19.389 --> 01:02:22.310]  Immediately that aren't even as bad as the current strain.
[01:02:22.330 --> 01:02:26.891]  They'll say they're worse, fear monger and then clamp down even stronger.
[01:02:27.692 --> 01:02:28.792]  That's what they've done in Italy.
[01:02:28.872 --> 01:02:34.073]  It's what they've done in other areas where they've been beta testing like Spain and now moving towards Australia.
[01:02:34.093 --> 01:02:35.274]  So this is all formulaic.
[01:02:35.334 --> 01:02:38.175]  It's all heavily scripted and we know their plan.
[01:02:39.235 --> 01:02:47.157]  InfoWars.
[01:02:47.197 --> 01:02:48.318]  Tomorrow's news.
[01:02:48.378 --> 01:02:48.738]  Today.
[01:02:49.781 --> 01:03:05.721]  And we are back here now live in the InfoWorld headquarters in Austin, Texas, and it's too bad we don't have a real legitimate media in this country that is able to get into the White House press gaggle every day.
[01:03:07.614 --> 01:03:18.236]  And call all these hypocrisies and tyrannies to task on Jen Psaki, other than Peter Doocy, who's, I mean, you know, Peter Doocy's good and he asks the questions, but he's not really that hardcore.
[01:03:18.596 --> 01:03:21.237]  But at least he's there, at least he's getting the questions in.
[01:03:21.777 --> 01:03:31.639]  And so, naturally, you know, whoever's up there, whether it's Psaki or whoever they choose next, is going to be floundering and flipping and flopping around like a fish out of water on this.
[01:03:32.899 --> 01:03:38.485]  Because there is no consistency, there's all kinds of illogic, and mostly just lies.
[01:03:38.905 --> 01:03:50.217]  So here's Peter Doocy asking the one person in there who's not a Democrat activist, asking Psaki about all of this, and here she is trying her best to make sense of it.
[01:03:50.237 --> 01:03:56.203]  Still, then why do vaccinated people need to put the masks back on?
[01:03:56.943 --> 01:04:07.189]  Well, Peter, first of all, I would say again, just to go back to this chart, which I will handily point to again, if you are vaccinated, you're vaccinated, your life, it can save your life.
[01:04:07.450 --> 01:04:16.075]  And I think the clear data shows that this pandemic is killing, is hospitalizing, is making people very sick who are not vaccinated.
[01:04:16.415 --> 01:04:20.938]  That still continues to be the case, regardless of what the mass guidance looks like.
[01:04:21.198 --> 01:04:30.545]  If vaccines work, which this sign says that they do, then why do people who have had the vaccine need to now wear masks the same as people who have not had it?
[01:04:31.357 --> 01:04:47.927]  Because the public health leaders in our administration have made the determination, based on data, that that is a way to make sure they're protected, their loved ones are protected, and that's an extra step given the transmissibility of the virus that they're advising people.
[01:04:48.247 --> 01:04:58.893]  Today, they're changing their guidance, they're changing their advice to the American public, their public health advice, based on evolving data and an evolving historic virus.
[01:04:59.193 --> 01:05:00.434]  That's exactly what they should be doing.
[01:05:01.054 --> 01:05:11.543]  Is your message to Americans who are feeling whiplash right now, why should they trust the same group of health officials who just two months ago told them they don't have to wear a mask anymore inside?
[01:05:11.964 --> 01:05:21.131]  Because our goal is to save their lives and our responsibility and the responsibility of public health officials is to continue to provide updated guidance.
[01:05:24.154 --> 01:05:26.736]  You know it's funny, she never even answered Peter Ducey's question.
[01:05:26.756 --> 01:05:27.417]  Did you notice that?
[01:05:29.724 --> 01:05:31.945]  She never even answered the question.
[01:05:33.826 --> 01:05:35.487]  This White House is a joke, man.
[01:05:37.489 --> 01:05:38.409]  Oh my gosh.
[01:05:38.789 --> 01:05:39.670]  What a monster.
[01:05:41.091 --> 01:05:42.732]  What a monster Jen Psaki is.
[01:05:44.473 --> 01:05:46.254]  The willing foot soldier.
[01:05:48.395 --> 01:05:55.980]  The willing voice box of the corrupted, bought-and-paid-for New World Order White House.
[01:05:57.870 --> 01:06:03.152]  And Jen Psaki just sits there and tells lie after lie after lie.
[01:06:04.492 --> 01:06:14.375]  Covers up for all the nonsensical, illogical, double standard, non-scientific BS.
[01:06:16.411 --> 01:06:20.034]  That comes out of our politicians' and our health officials' mouths.
[01:06:20.454 --> 01:06:22.336]  The vaccine works, but wear the mask.
[01:06:23.056 --> 01:06:25.919]  The vaccine works, but vaccinated people are spreading the disease.
[01:06:26.399 --> 01:06:30.402]  The vaccine works, but now you need to get three and four and five booster shots.
[01:06:33.124 --> 01:06:36.147]  And the average liberal out there, they know it's all a lie.
[01:06:36.807 --> 01:06:37.888]  And they don't even care.
[01:06:38.769 --> 01:06:42.412]  They just want to have an excuse to tell you to wear a mask and take a vaccine.
[01:06:43.581 --> 01:06:48.123]  You just see how this whole thing has been planned out well in advance.
[01:06:50.984 --> 01:06:53.245]  They always knew they'd bring back the mask mandate.
[01:06:53.285 --> 01:06:56.627]  They always knew they'd bring back the shutdown.
[01:06:56.987 --> 01:07:10.393]  They always knew that they would eventually force this vaccine, even though it's still experimental and in emergency use authorization right now, for a virus that has a 99.9
[01:07:13.097 --> 01:07:22.582]  Let me just focus and see if I can't get through this stack of news so that you can know the truth about what's going on when it comes to the CDC masks and COVID.
[01:07:43.735 --> 01:07:44.976]  USA Today.
[01:07:48.159 --> 01:07:59.527]  New data suggests vaccinated individuals could have higher levels of virus and infect others amid the surging cases driven by the Delta variant of the coronavirus.
[01:08:00.108 --> 01:08:03.010]  The vaccinated people are the ones that created the Delta variant.
[01:08:03.931 --> 01:08:07.494]  And now anybody who's honestly looking into it knows that that's the truth.
[01:08:07.934 --> 01:08:08.795]  Biden lied.
[01:08:08.975 --> 01:08:09.775]  Fauci lied.
[01:08:10.216 --> 01:08:12.618]  Everybody who said the vaccine protects you lied.
[01:08:14.215 --> 01:08:15.296]  CBS Sacramento.
[01:08:15.756 --> 01:08:19.238]  Higher COVID rate found in some counties with higher vaccination rates.
[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:21.620]  Yep.
[01:08:21.940 --> 01:08:28.725]  But they're still saying now in California you have to have the COVID vaccine in order to do anything.
[01:08:28.785 --> 01:08:30.966]  Go to a restaurant, go to a bar, go to work.
[01:08:32.147 --> 01:08:35.329]  Doesn't matter the vaccine is neither safe or effective.
[01:08:35.890 --> 01:08:40.373]  CDC director now says new data shows breakthrough cases in vaccinated people.
[01:08:41.454 --> 01:08:50.965]  And that those vaccinated people can spread as much of the virus as the unvaccinated and in fact they spread the virus more than the unvaccinated.
[01:08:50.985 --> 01:09:02.017]  CDC Director Rochelle Walensky says new mask wearing guidance and more vaccinations could halt rising coronavirus cases in a couple of weeks.
[01:09:04.423 --> 01:09:08.905]  In a couple of weeks, and the CDC announces vaccinated people must wear masks indoors.
[01:09:08.945 --> 01:09:13.548]  So there's your two weeks to stop the spread once again.
[01:09:13.588 --> 01:09:15.829]  We're still in the original two weeks to stop the spread.
[01:09:15.849 --> 01:09:18.170]  A year and a half later.
[01:09:18.650 --> 01:09:19.190]  What a joke.
[01:09:20.651 --> 01:09:22.292]  Ken Delaney from NBC reporting.
[01:09:23.032 --> 01:09:33.498]  New data suggests that fully vaccinated individuals are not just contracting COVID, but could be carrying higher levels of the virus than previously understood, facilitating spread.
[01:09:34.997 --> 01:09:36.178]  And then that's their excuse.
[01:09:37.219 --> 01:09:37.839]  So it's incredible.
[01:09:37.879 --> 01:09:44.745]  So any fair-minded person that doesn't understand what's going on just says, hey, wait a second.
[01:09:45.366 --> 01:09:46.006]  I'm vaccinated.
[01:09:46.046 --> 01:09:47.348]  Why do I have to wear the mask again?
[01:09:47.748 --> 01:09:48.889]  So this is their excuse.
[01:09:48.949 --> 01:09:53.112]  Well, you have to wear the mask because vaccinated people are still spreading the disease and still getting sick.
[01:09:54.033 --> 01:09:57.616]  And then you would say, well, then if the vaccine doesn't work, why do I have to get it?
[01:09:59.078 --> 01:10:00.539]  They say, because you're in a deadly pandemic.
[01:10:01.761 --> 01:10:13.349]  So it's this just cycle of misinformation and propaganda that you can never escape until you choose to just leave and admit that it's nothing but lies and propaganda.
[01:10:14.110 --> 01:10:18.053]  CDC Director, vaccine passports may very well be the path forward.
[01:10:19.329 --> 01:10:23.472]  That's forced vaccines, experimental vaccine, violation of the Nuremberg Code.
[01:10:24.193 --> 01:10:31.018]  And if we still believe in the Nuremberg Code, anybody who forces you to take an experimental injection is punishable by the death penalty.
[01:10:31.439 --> 01:10:35.042]  I don't know if we're still going off the Nuremberg Code or if we're deciding to be the Nazis now.
[01:10:35.482 --> 01:10:37.143]  You'd have to ask the CDC that.
[01:10:37.844 --> 01:10:40.026]  Maybe Peter Doocy will bring that up to Jen Psaki.
[01:10:41.761 --> 01:10:44.905]  More bots on Twitter.
[01:10:44.985 --> 01:10:54.175]  So remember last week we showed, or I may have even covered it yesterday too, how you had tens of thousands of bots on Twitter saying, we're being crushed by COVID.
[01:10:54.235 --> 01:10:55.957]  I just got out of the ICU.
[01:10:56.017 --> 01:10:57.218]  I just got out of the ER.
[01:10:57.579 --> 01:10:59.080]  It's nothing but COVID patients.
[01:10:59.121 --> 01:11:00.502]  We're all dying from COVID.
[01:11:01.519 --> 01:11:10.063]  Just tens of thousands of these bot accounts, some of them even with verified check marks, and some of them doctors too, who knows if these are even real people.
[01:11:11.003 --> 01:11:13.985]  And so you know that that's when you know it's propaganda, that's when you know it's fake news.
[01:11:14.225 --> 01:11:15.685]  Twitter doesn't censor that, by the way.
[01:11:16.566 --> 01:11:23.309]  Now you have the latest fake news bot, thousands and thousands and thousands of tweets saying this exact same thing.
[01:11:24.924 --> 01:11:26.646]  Anti-vaccine rhetoric is dangerous.
[01:11:26.726 --> 01:11:34.815]  Vaccine hesitancy and refusal threaten public health and assault lawmakers and others and is otherwise unacceptable.
[01:11:34.995 --> 01:11:36.397]  Stop anti-vax violence.
[01:11:36.457 --> 01:11:37.678]  Hashtag vaccines work.
[01:11:38.359 --> 01:11:43.345]  So now you have tens of thousands of these tweets being sent out by bots.
[01:11:43.705 --> 01:11:44.927]  Total propaganda.
[01:11:47.179 --> 01:11:51.380]  Hey, if the vaccine is so safe and effective, why do you need to propagandize me into taking it?
[01:11:51.740 --> 01:11:55.281]  Hey, if it's such a deadly disease, why do you have to keep reminding me how dangerous it is?
[01:11:55.301 --> 01:11:57.201]  Why wouldn't I just know that from living my life?
[01:11:57.321 --> 01:11:58.061]  No, it's all lies.
[01:12:00.382 --> 01:12:08.044]  Facebook critics are protesting the company's handling of COVID-19 disinformation, even though they're censoring everybody.
[01:12:08.464 --> 01:12:09.864]  So, I mean, I don't know what you want them to do.
[01:12:11.164 --> 01:12:12.905]  It's not enough to just censor free speech.
[01:12:12.945 --> 01:12:13.405]  They want anybody
[01:12:15.470 --> 01:12:18.714]  Who's reporting the truth about vaccines to die is what they really want.
[01:12:19.174 --> 01:12:20.616]  Because Facebook is already censoring it.
[01:12:20.656 --> 01:12:21.717]  So what do these people really want?
[01:12:21.737 --> 01:12:22.458]  They want you dead!
[01:12:22.478 --> 01:12:24.540]  Hey, we just want to protect your life.
[01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:25.221]  Wear a mask.
[01:12:25.261 --> 01:12:26.082]  Take a vaccine.
[01:12:26.362 --> 01:12:28.204]  But if you don't, well, I think you should die.
[01:12:28.224 --> 01:12:31.167]  That's your modern-day liberal.
[01:12:31.227 --> 01:12:31.528]  And so...
[01:12:33.206 --> 01:12:36.089]  They're out in front of the Facebook office in D.C.
[01:12:36.129 --> 01:12:40.474]  with these body bags, and it says, Facebook disinfo kills.
[01:12:41.656 --> 01:12:43.237]  That's right out of Biden's mouth, actually.
[01:12:43.257 --> 01:12:45.700]  He didn't know what he said at the time, but now it's this trend.
[01:12:46.020 --> 01:12:47.162]  So they have all these body bags.
[01:12:47.903 --> 01:12:48.763]  I'm curious, though.
[01:12:49.983 --> 01:13:01.931]  I'm curious if these activists with these body bags, I wonder who funded all this, I'm curious, are they going to go outside the CDC with the, how many body bags would they need now for the vaccine deaths?
[01:13:02.551 --> 01:13:03.612]  That would be a fun image.
[01:13:04.593 --> 01:13:05.293]  How about that?
[01:13:06.274 --> 01:13:08.976]  Because they're all about their protests and their images, right?
[01:13:09.276 --> 01:13:11.737]  And now they're doing the body bag treatment in front of Facebook?
[01:13:11.917 --> 01:13:13.238]  It's just so stupid.
[01:13:14.519 --> 01:13:18.382]  But these aren't smart people we're dealing with, they're brainwashed minions of the New World Order.
[01:13:19.611 --> 01:13:21.874]  They are minions of the devil, of Satan.
[01:13:22.875 --> 01:13:29.402]  So, why don't we have somebody take, what is the number now, 12,000 that we know of?
[01:13:32.462 --> 01:13:37.525]  12,000 body bags and put them in front of the White House and say, here's how many people died of the vaccine.
[01:13:38.345 --> 01:13:41.688]  Hey, you can still love the vaccine, but hey, let's have a little demonstration.
[01:13:42.008 --> 01:13:43.469]  Here's 12,000 body bags.
[01:13:43.809 --> 01:13:45.890]  These are all the people that died from the COVID vaccine.
[01:13:46.571 --> 01:13:53.815]  According to the Health and Human Services official website of Vaccine Adverse Reactions, VAERS, I've shown the charts.
[01:13:53.855 --> 01:13:57.578]  The numbers continue to go up because they keep making people take this vaccine.
[01:13:59.226 --> 01:13:59.847]  I mean, let's do it.
[01:13:59.907 --> 01:14:11.158]  Or maybe go in front of a CDC office, or a World Health Organization office, and just put 12,000 body bags out there, and that will properly illustrate how many people have died from the vaccine.
[01:14:12.780 --> 01:14:14.181]  They love their demonstration.
[01:14:14.221 --> 01:14:15.443]  They love their optics.
[01:14:16.003 --> 01:14:18.045]  Well, that can go both ways, couldn't it?
[01:14:20.087 --> 01:14:21.429]  So, I'd love to see somebody
[01:14:22.619 --> 01:14:28.731]  Of course we don't have a big billionaire donor like George Soros who probably paid for those body bags to go do this or whoever it is.
[01:14:31.624 --> 01:14:47.775]  Why don't we have somebody take 12,000 body bags and put them outside of the White House or outside of a World Health Organization office or outside of a CDC office to illustrate how many people died from the COVID vaccine.
[01:14:48.675 --> 01:14:51.097]  And then Facebook would declare that misinformation and censor it.
[01:14:51.557 --> 01:14:52.818]  But that's not enough for the left.
[01:14:53.118 --> 01:14:58.442]  Even though Facebook is engaged in censorship, they still say vaccine misinformation, disinformation kills.
[01:14:59.082 --> 01:15:00.743]  Not as much as the vaccine kills.
[01:15:03.525 --> 01:15:06.066]  Better Call Saul star gets COVID vaccine.
[01:15:07.607 --> 01:15:08.488]  That was a few months ago.
[01:15:08.808 --> 01:15:20.994]  And then, oh, Bob Odenkirk, who is the guy who got the COVID vaccine, hospitalized after collapsing on Better Call Saul set.
[01:15:21.555 --> 01:15:23.356]  So Bob Odenkirk gets the vaccine.
[01:15:23.376 --> 01:15:27.278]  A few weeks later, collapses on the set of his show.
[01:15:28.816 --> 01:15:37.782]  100.
[01:15:28.956 --> 01:15:37.782]  I mean, what are the odds that that's from the vaccine, though?
[01:15:38.182 --> 01:15:37.782]  100%?
[01:15:38.483 --> 01:15:37.782]  99.9%?
[01:15:39.063 --> 01:15:41.385]  99.8%?
[01:15:39.083 --> 01:15:41.385]  98%?
[01:15:40.264 --> 01:15:41.385]  Yet another example.
[01:15:41.565 --> 01:15:43.846]  Somebody gets the vaccine and then dies.
[01:15:44.307 --> 01:15:46.768]  Or somebody gets the vaccine and then collapses.
[01:15:46.788 --> 01:15:48.009]  It's probably going to come out.
[01:15:48.129 --> 01:15:49.070]  He had a blood clot.
[01:15:49.310 --> 01:15:53.393]  Just like 60% of the people that get the vaccine end up having blood clots.
[01:15:53.413 --> 01:15:58.196]  All right, let me continue here on the COVID news front.
[01:16:00.936 --> 01:16:02.898]  This is a big one right here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:16:02.938 --> 01:16:04.339]  This is the dangerous one.
[01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:17.892]  And this is the one that tells you they do have the plan in place to go door-to-door with forced vaccines because they've already launched their safety net.
[01:16:18.792 --> 01:16:23.477]  Department of Justice declares COVID-19 vaccine mandates are legal.
[01:16:23.617 --> 01:16:24.298]  Now, again,
[01:16:25.526 --> 01:16:28.227]  This is not an FDA approved vaccine.
[01:16:28.967 --> 01:16:33.468]  It is still in the trial process right now as we speak.
[01:16:33.728 --> 01:16:44.031]  The only reason anybody's allowed to give you this vaccine is because of the Emergency Use Authorization Act.
[01:16:44.921 --> 01:16:49.283]  Which has really, there should be some sort of a limit on that.
[01:16:49.343 --> 01:16:51.524]  There should be some sort of a time base on that.
[01:16:51.564 --> 01:16:53.365]  There should be more standards on that.
[01:16:53.445 --> 01:16:53.985]  There's not.
[01:16:54.585 --> 01:16:55.926]  We were never in an emergency.
[01:16:57.387 --> 01:16:58.847]  But here's the self-fulfilling prophecy.
[01:17:01.068 --> 01:17:02.709]  They make a virus in a lab.
[01:17:04.090 --> 01:17:17.613]  They then release it on the world, they then use the media to scare the entire planet that this is the deadliest virus in world history, and then they get their emergency use authorization to give you this experimental vaccine.
[01:17:20.473 --> 01:17:27.154]  And so, it doesn't matter if the virus is 99.9% survivable, which it is, and we have that data.
[01:17:30.143 --> 01:17:32.505]  They're still in the trial phase of this vaccine.
[01:17:32.545 --> 01:17:34.726]  They still have the emergency use authorization.
[01:17:35.086 --> 01:17:36.287]  That should have been revoked.
[01:17:36.327 --> 01:17:37.388]  That should have been removed.
[01:17:37.748 --> 01:17:38.809]  We're not in an emergency.
[01:17:39.809 --> 01:17:41.330]  Ah, but the big lie persists.
[01:17:42.811 --> 01:17:48.235]  And so now the Justice Department says it's legal to mandate vaccines.
[01:17:48.875 --> 01:17:49.476]  No, it's not.
[01:17:51.437 --> 01:17:59.222]  And now you have the most corrupt Justice Department in the history of America in direct violation of the Nuremberg Code.
[01:18:01.304 --> 01:18:02.674]  And so, it's time...
[01:18:04.810 --> 01:18:31.489]  For an investigation to be launched into the Department of Justice, into Merrick Garland, and it's time for Nuremberg Trials 2.0 to come out with the old Nuremberg Code as the backdrop, and everybody involved in these vaccines and mandating these vaccines needs to be brought in for trial and investigated, and if it's found they're in violation of the Nuremberg Code, then they should suffer the death penalty according to the Nuremberg Code.
[01:18:33.243 --> 01:18:34.524]  I didn't write the Nuremberg Code.
[01:18:35.265 --> 01:18:43.332]  I wasn't alive when the Nazis were experimenting with Jews and coercing them into medical experimentation without telling them.
[01:18:43.912 --> 01:18:56.403]  But the world decided that was a bad thing, had the Nuremberg Trials, wrote the Nuremberg Code, said you cannot force anybody, you cannot coerce anybody, you cannot mandate anybody.
[01:18:56.843 --> 01:18:57.343]  Be apart.
[01:18:58.394 --> 01:19:03.155]  of a medical experiment and right now that is what is happening in the world.
[01:19:03.275 --> 01:19:05.076]  That is what our government is doing to us.
[01:19:05.596 --> 01:19:07.456]  That is what the French government is trying to do.
[01:19:07.996 --> 01:19:11.777]  That is what all these corrupt governments are trying to do right now as we speak.
[01:19:12.277 --> 01:19:26.241]  Force you into a medical experiment known as the COVID-19 vaccine that is still in experimental phase, killing tens of thousands of people, and now the Department of Justice is in direct violation of the Nuremberg Code and should be treated as such.
[01:19:28.612 --> 01:19:30.673]  But, again, that's not going to matter.
[01:19:30.793 --> 01:19:32.034]  We don't live in sane times.
[01:19:32.174 --> 01:19:34.215]  We don't have any justice anymore on this planet.
[01:19:34.916 --> 01:19:36.417]  It's one-sided justice.
[01:19:36.537 --> 01:19:38.598]  Whatever the globalists want to do, they do.
[01:19:39.098 --> 01:19:41.680]  Whatever the Democrat Party wants to do, they do.
[01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:45.102]  And so, yeah, this is an open-shut case.
[01:19:45.702 --> 01:19:52.526]  Everybody involved in forcing you to take a COVID-19 vaccine is a direct violation of the Nuremberg Code.
[01:19:52.786 --> 01:19:55.428]  And according to the Nuremberg Code, that's punishable by death.
[01:19:57.756 --> 01:19:59.778]  That's not misinformation, that's just fact.
[01:20:00.298 --> 01:20:03.201]  But go ahead and write up your stories and talk about that being misinformation.
[01:20:03.842 --> 01:20:10.288]  As more than 10,000 people die from this vaccine, the number will be over 20,000 by the end of the year.
[01:20:10.548 --> 01:20:13.631]  Who knows where that number will cap at once this is all said and done.
[01:20:13.852 --> 01:20:15.894]  We still don't know the long-term effects of this vaccine.
[01:20:17.338 --> 01:20:25.120]  Again, I just covered it in the last segment, an actor who got the vaccine a couple months ago just collapsed on his set, probably blood clots.
[01:20:25.820 --> 01:20:34.582]  So there's going to be a lot of people that aren't even getting the negative side effects yet because the ticking time bomb that is this experimental vaccine just hasn't blown up yet.
[01:20:36.563 --> 01:20:37.923]  But here's why this is significant.
[01:20:38.083 --> 01:20:41.844]  This just tells you, this is what the Justice Department has just told you.
[01:20:43.197 --> 01:20:48.619]  They know that all this, everything they're doing with this vaccine is totally illegal.
[01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:52.961]  Again, you have to invert everything the New World Order tells you.
[01:20:52.981 --> 01:20:55.602]  You have to invert everything the Biden administration tells you.
[01:20:55.622 --> 01:20:58.523]  You have to invert everything our politicians tell you right now.
[01:20:58.963 --> 01:21:04.325]  So when they say that it's legal to mandate vaccines, that means it's illegal and they know it.
[01:21:05.385 --> 01:21:06.526]  So this is just cover
[01:21:08.576 --> 01:21:37.089]  Knowing that they're going to mandate these vaccines, hundreds of thousands of people are going to die from them, and now they're just going to say, well, yeah, you killed 100,000 people with these mandatory vaccines, and then the people that did it, whether it's politicians or doctors or whoever it is, they now have the cover, thanks to the Department of Justice, to say, well, it was legal, you can't sue me, I was trying to stop a pandemic.
[01:21:38.567 --> 01:21:41.389]  And they're hoping that there's no lawyers out there.
[01:21:41.949 --> 01:21:56.477]  They're hoping that the American people or the people of the world out there have no idea what the Nuremberg Code is and won't bring the Nuremberg Code up in this great debate of forced sterilization or forced death known as the COVID-19 vaccine.
[01:21:58.277 --> 01:22:13.563]  So they invert reality and they say it's perfectly legal to mandate this experimental vaccine even though it's not legal, it's in violation of the Nuremberg Code, it's in violation of just any basic medical ethics.
[01:22:14.591 --> 01:22:36.756]  To force somebody to take an experimental vaccine, when we know that it's killing people, when we know that if you've had COVID you have the antibodies forever, when we know that if you've had COVID and you get the vaccine it's even more deadly, when we know that for some age groups the vaccine is already more deadly than COVID, now they've just written off they have the right to kill you with a vaccine.
[01:22:38.112 --> 01:22:41.434]  So the Department of Justice declares medical tyranny to be legal.
[01:22:41.954 --> 01:22:52.439]  Well look, if the Department of Justice declares euthanization to be legal, if the Department of Justice says coerced euthanization is legal, does that mean it's legal?
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:56.241]  If the Department of Justice says murder is legal, does that make it legal?
[01:22:56.761 --> 01:23:01.044]  If the Department of Justice says you can rape somebody if you want, that's legal, does that make it legal?
[01:23:03.025 --> 01:23:03.645]  Of course not!
[01:23:05.046 --> 01:23:08.088]  But now they feel they have their safety net.
[01:23:09.189 --> 01:23:15.073]  So to me, this says they are not getting the approval from the FDA on the timetable they want, if ever.
[01:23:16.214 --> 01:23:23.239]  And so now they're pretending that the Department of Justice is the FDA, and they're saying, yep, you can mandate vaccines.
[01:23:24.981 --> 01:23:32.927]  So when they mandate them in California, and they mandate them in New York, and tens of thousands of people die from the vaccines, now they have their legal cover,
[01:23:34.215 --> 01:23:37.518]  They already have their legal cover with the secret vaccine courts.
[01:23:37.578 --> 01:23:39.339]  You can't sue vaccine manufacturers.
[01:23:40.060 --> 01:23:46.065]  And now they have their legal cover to say, well, the Department of Justice said that it's legal, so I'm just going to mandate these vaccines.
[01:23:46.645 --> 01:23:50.008]  And now you won't be able to sue me in court saying that it was illegal to do it.
[01:23:50.088 --> 01:23:51.749]  See, the Department of Justice is on my side.
[01:23:52.250 --> 01:23:54.331]  Totally illegal, totally corrupt.
[01:23:54.932 --> 01:23:56.193]  Everybody should be afraid of this.
[01:23:59.878 --> 01:24:02.039]  So that's where we're at there.
[01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:08.183]  Twitter censors the Nation of Islam for criticizing mRNA vaccines, but not for being anti-Semitic.
[01:24:08.303 --> 01:24:09.224]  You gotta love that.
[01:24:10.044 --> 01:24:11.325]  You just gotta love that.
[01:24:11.405 --> 01:24:17.729]  So the Nation of Islam can exist on Twitter and, you know, call for the death of all Jews and wipe Israel off the map and all that good stuff.
[01:24:18.249 --> 01:24:23.713]  But oh, if they say something about the vaccines that Twitter doesn't like, then they get banned.
[01:24:24.493 --> 01:24:24.894]  Isn't that fun?
[01:24:28.157 --> 01:24:34.181]  And then the La Jolla Police Department, apparently months behind InfoWars, they don't even know what's going on in their own city.
[01:24:34.201 --> 01:24:37.824]  That should shock you, if you're in La Jolla, that your police are that inept.
[01:24:38.304 --> 01:24:39.765]  But that's just the truth.
[01:24:40.185 --> 01:24:47.711]  La Jolla Police say Hotel is housing migrants with COVID-19 that have been released by Border Patrol, and they say they had no idea it was going on.
[01:24:49.116 --> 01:24:58.806]  Uh, how can the La Jolla police have no idea this is going on when InfoWars broke this news months ago and I was on the ground in the southern border in the Rio Grande Valley?
[01:24:58.826 --> 01:25:04.873]  I mean, how many hotels did we go to that were filled up with COVID positive people that were released by?
[01:25:06.052 --> 01:25:06.572]  Border Patrol?
[01:25:06.592 --> 01:25:06.572]  5, 6, 7, 8?
[01:25:07.813 --> 01:25:09.414]  I mean, we lost count.
[01:25:09.454 --> 01:25:10.095]  There were so many.
[01:25:10.135 --> 01:25:18.880]  We were following the buses all around town, filling up hotels, entire hotels, with COVID-19 positive illegal immigrants that had been released.
[01:25:19.300 --> 01:25:29.026]  And remember, we would go to these hotels, and the hotel owner would come out and threaten me, and get in my face and threaten me, and then called the police on me!
[01:25:29.346 --> 01:25:30.027]  Think about that!
[01:25:31.496 --> 01:25:33.057]  That's how big of a joke this is!
[01:25:33.797 --> 01:25:45.203]  I went to these hotels, I covered that these were all COVID positive patients in the hotels released by Border Patrol, and the owners of the hotels called the police on me!
[01:25:45.223 --> 01:25:48.345]  And they still didn't know what was going on!
[01:25:48.545 --> 01:25:49.726]  Did they not believe me?
[01:25:50.626 --> 01:25:52.107]  Did they think I was making it up?
[01:25:52.187 --> 01:25:56.449]  I mean, literally, the cops would come and I'd say, officer, these are all illegal immigrants.
[01:25:56.809 --> 01:26:00.570]  They've all tested positive for COVID and they've all been released by Border Patrol.
[01:26:00.810 --> 01:26:02.211]  What are you doing here looking at me?
[01:26:03.411 --> 01:26:08.294]  So even though InfoWars told the police this was going on, they still didn't believe us.
[01:26:08.594 --> 01:26:11.395]  But now I guess they believe it since they've seen it for themselves.
[01:26:12.904 --> 01:26:28.635]  From Tunisia, to Italy, to Greece, to Thailand, and all parts beyond, humanity is pushing back against the botched overreach agenda, targeting our fundamental individual rights, threatened by the COVID hypocrisy.
[01:26:32.178 --> 01:26:36.481]  The police are standing down and joining protesters in some protests.
[01:26:37.201 --> 01:26:37.702]  Merci!
[01:26:39.121 --> 01:26:39.921]  Thank you!
[01:26:40.462 --> 01:26:44.084]  While delivering the brutal totalitarian bidding in others.
[01:26:44.364 --> 01:26:50.627]  Meanwhile, the leaders of the crackdown on human freedom reveal their own incompetence and detachment.
[01:26:50.647 --> 01:27:02.253]  That's why the Cabinet decided today, that starting August 8th, Sarvan Hisun will not be able to enter the Colonnade, the Theater, the Knesset, the Luna Park,
[01:27:02.953 --> 01:27:13.617]  Back in the United States, the message from the Biden administration has driven those expressing their First Amendment to be beaten in the street by the zombies of Marxism.
[01:27:32.503 --> 01:27:40.129]  So as a child survivor of the Nazi reign of terror, I learned indelible lessons about the nature of evil.
[01:27:41.530 --> 01:27:47.535]  I know the consequences of being stigmatized and demonized as a spreader of disease.
[01:27:48.216 --> 01:27:59.865]  We were required, as Germans know, to wear a yellow Star of David to identify us, to segregate Jews,
[01:28:01.306 --> 01:28:07.452]  Exclusionary laws barred the family from normal life, from attending ordinary activities.
[01:28:09.534 --> 01:28:11.556]  Our property was impounded.
[01:28:12.357 --> 01:28:18.202]  We were forbidden to participate in all educational, religious, cultural gatherings.
[01:28:19.223 --> 01:28:22.887]  Travel was forbidden for Jews, so there was no escape.
[01:28:23.367 --> 01:28:24.788]  These painful memories
[01:28:25.814 --> 01:28:33.498]  from my childhood sensitized me to the threat posed by current restrictive government dictates.
[01:28:34.119 --> 01:28:38.981]  Under the Nazi regime, moral norms were systematically obliterated.
[01:28:40.082 --> 01:28:43.924]  The medical profession and institutions were radically transformed.
[01:28:44.404 --> 01:28:50.708]  Academic science, the military, industry and clinical medicine were tightly interwoven.
[01:28:53.719 --> 01:28:59.422]  Consider the question of what would be ideal from the perspective of the pharmaceutical industry at the moment?
[01:29:00.062 --> 01:29:11.227]  It would be ideal if vaccines were recommended for all people irrespective of their age, irrespective of whether they had already had COVID-19, and irrespective of whether or not they were pregnant.
[01:29:11.527 --> 01:29:13.287]  I've been through outbreak after outbreak.
[01:29:13.308 --> 01:29:14.828]  I've never seen anything like this integration
[01:29:29.471 --> 01:29:31.793]  Harmonization and enforcement.
[01:29:31.853 --> 01:29:34.796]  I mean, it is overtly authoritarian.
[01:29:35.377 --> 01:29:47.789]  And it's coming down from above, and it's coordinated, and it has developed, they've developed a bunch of different vehicles to reinforce this dominant narrative and make it so that
[01:29:48.449 --> 01:29:59.533]  No other information is available to people so that people behave the way that the Health and Human Services and World Health Organization want them to behave.
[01:30:00.133 --> 01:30:01.674]  This is behavior control.
[01:30:02.714 --> 01:30:04.995]  It's really psyops is what's happening.
[01:30:05.035 --> 01:30:13.258]  It's applied psychological operations to control people and their behavior so that they will accept these products which are still experimental
[01:30:14.451 --> 01:30:26.156]  Based on technology that has never been deployed at this level, and as the data are coming out, it's becoming more and more clear that these products are not completely safe.
[01:30:26.797 --> 01:30:32.699]  Before you got sick, if you would have had a chance to get the vaccine and prevent this, would you have taken the vaccine?
[01:30:32.719 --> 01:30:34.780]  So you would have gone through this?
[01:30:34.900 --> 01:30:36.001]  I'd have gone through this, yes sir.
[01:30:36.521 --> 01:30:37.721]  Don't shove it down my throat.
[01:30:38.582 --> 01:30:40.863]  That's what's local,
[01:30:42.328 --> 01:30:46.772]  State, federal administration is trying to do is shove it down your throat.
[01:30:46.912 --> 01:30:47.633]  What are they shoving?
[01:30:47.653 --> 01:30:48.153]  The science?
[01:30:48.814 --> 01:30:50.996]  No, they're shoving the fact that that's their agenda.
[01:30:51.236 --> 01:30:52.517]  John Bowne reporting.
[01:30:52.537 --> 01:30:58.222]  All right, we're now into our number three of the Alex Jones Show today.
[01:30:58.242 --> 01:31:06.810]  We're gonna have a special report coming up from Alex Jones here at the bottom of the hour.
[01:31:08.240 --> 01:31:16.405]  Let me just pivot onto this, because I've got more vaccine news, but I think we get the point on that for the most part.
[01:31:17.826 --> 01:31:20.128]  Well, and now I'm looking at this stack over here.
[01:31:20.708 --> 01:31:22.709]  Still some pretty big stuff there.
[01:31:24.250 --> 01:31:34.176]  But let me just turn my attention over to this stack of news, which is the other big story for today, and that's the big Democrat show hearing that went on yesterday.
[01:31:34.196 --> 01:31:36.278]  And ask yourself this.
[01:31:38.044 --> 01:31:39.665]  Ask yourself this.
[01:31:40.305 --> 01:31:53.489]  Why did they find it necessary to do the January 6th show hearing yesterday, even though they've already arrested 550 people, thrown them into the Democrat gulags, and are torturing them right now?
[01:31:53.569 --> 01:31:56.330]  Yes, the Democrats have political prisoners that they're torturing right now.
[01:31:57.131 --> 01:32:02.813]  That's your loving, tolerant, anti-police state Democrat party that has political prisoners being tortured in jail right now.
[01:32:04.013 --> 01:32:04.553]  But why?
[01:32:04.573 --> 01:32:04.633]  Why?
[01:32:07.288 --> 01:32:11.994]  Would they be doing this?
[01:32:14.256 --> 01:32:21.085]  And I have the answer now, and I thought I had this video clip, but perhaps I don't.
[01:32:21.685 --> 01:32:23.527]  That's okay, because I know what was said anyway.
[01:32:25.854 --> 01:32:45.223]  So the anti-Trump Black Lives Matter Democrat activist police officer, who also has major Democrat attorneys representing them, who has also been pictured with Nancy Pelosi, who wears all the Democrat propaganda, who tweeted in support of the riots in the summer of 2020, Officer Dunn.
[01:32:46.684 --> 01:32:55.368]  You don't have a more phony, lying dirtbag in the DC police as Officer
[01:32:57.489 --> 01:32:58.470]  Harry Dunn.
[01:32:59.751 --> 01:33:00.632]  He is the worst.
[01:33:01.293 --> 01:33:06.999]  That's why the Democrats selected him to be the voice box of the big lie from January 6th.
[01:33:07.279 --> 01:33:13.605]  And he says he gets called the N-word but doesn't produce the body cam video evidence, audio evidence, because he made that up too.
[01:33:14.566 --> 01:33:17.229]  It's the Jussie Smollett of the DC police force.
[01:33:19.352 --> 01:33:23.653]  And it's so pathetic that they don't even hide who he is.
[01:33:23.713 --> 01:33:28.014]  You can still go see all of his anti-cop tweets.
[01:33:28.434 --> 01:33:31.515]  You can go see all of his Democrat Party tweets.
[01:33:31.935 --> 01:33:34.496]  You can see that his lawyer's a top Democrat lawyer.
[01:33:34.776 --> 01:33:36.936]  You can see him hanging out with Nancy Pelosi.
[01:33:37.156 --> 01:33:38.077]  They don't even hide it.
[01:33:38.297 --> 01:33:39.677]  And I've got the receipts right here.
[01:33:41.217 --> 01:33:42.378]  And I'll get to that in a second.
[01:33:43.378 --> 01:33:47.239]  But he was the one that made the analogy
[01:33:49.042 --> 01:34:04.630]  And he said, if somebody hires a hitman, if somebody hires a hitman to commit murder, not only is the murderer the one that made the hit arrested and charged, but so is the one that hired the hitman.
[01:34:05.531 --> 01:34:06.791]  And of course, what is he saying?
[01:34:06.851 --> 01:34:11.834]  He says that the January 6th protesters were sent there by a hitman, and that hitman is Donald Trump.
[01:34:13.295 --> 01:34:14.675]  That's what this is really all about now.
[01:34:16.849 --> 01:34:19.610]  This isn't even about January 6th, this hearing.
[01:34:20.631 --> 01:34:22.391]  They already have all their political prisoners.
[01:34:22.431 --> 01:34:24.912]  They already have hundreds of more that they plan on arresting.
[01:34:24.992 --> 01:34:32.455]  They'll have thousands of people rotting in jail cells, being tortured by Democrats before this is all said and done.
[01:34:32.475 --> 01:34:33.155]  That's their plan.
[01:34:33.195 --> 01:34:36.737]  The Democrat Party's gone full Nazi, rounding up the Jews.
[01:34:37.117 --> 01:34:38.738]  Except in this case, it's Trump supporters.
[01:34:39.198 --> 01:34:41.319]  And they all fake cry up there too.
[01:34:41.379 --> 01:34:42.039]  It's all fake.
[01:34:42.079 --> 01:34:42.679]  It's all theater.
[01:34:46.175 --> 01:34:50.717]  The only reason they had those hearings yesterday is because they're trying to bring it back to Donald Trump.
[01:34:52.538 --> 01:34:54.779]  And they want to charge Donald Trump with murder for it.
[01:34:55.540 --> 01:34:58.001]  That's why they lied about Officer Sicknick yesterday.
[01:34:58.681 --> 01:35:04.064]  That's why they continue to tell the big lie that Trump supporters murdered somebody that day when that's not what happened.
[01:35:05.365 --> 01:35:10.007]  And by the way, remember how they lied and said it was armed and there were people with guns?
[01:35:10.127 --> 01:35:10.767]  That was a lie.
[01:35:10.967 --> 01:35:11.748]  They lied about that.
[01:35:13.444 --> 01:35:18.434]  So they really just want to, they want this to end up with charges on Donald Trump.
[01:35:18.594 --> 01:35:19.917]  That's what this is really all about.
[01:35:19.957 --> 01:35:21.860]  They're afraid that Donald Trump may run again.
[01:35:23.541 --> 01:35:35.572]  They're afraid that they can't bring him in in the Southern District of New York or with the corrupt New York Attorney General or all these corrupt DA's and PA's that they have in New York paid for with Soros.
[01:35:36.773 --> 01:35:41.877]  And so they're afraid they're not going to be able to arrest Trump and end Trump with their corrupt law enforcement in New York.
[01:35:42.418 --> 01:35:45.300]  So now they're going with the DC January 6th angle.
[01:35:46.499 --> 01:35:55.591]  Bringing back all their big lies, and they hope that this eventually will be blamed on Trump, and that that means they can arrest Trump for the whole thing, inciting an insurrection.
[01:35:56.032 --> 01:35:57.213]  That's what they really want.
[01:35:57.374 --> 01:35:58.014]  If not murder.
[01:35:59.476 --> 01:36:01.018]  That's what this is really all about.
[01:36:01.997 --> 01:36:06.858]  They've already got all their arrests and thousands of more political arrests planned in the future.
[01:36:07.878 --> 01:36:12.519]  They've already got the full force and power of law enforcement to go after all their political enemies.
[01:36:13.620 --> 01:36:20.941]  They've already gone full oppressive, full authoritarian, full tyrannical regime as far as the Democrat Party is concerned against Trump supporters.
[01:36:21.302 --> 01:36:22.942]  But now they want Trump.
[01:36:24.437 --> 01:36:25.618]  And that's what this is all about.
[01:36:26.158 --> 01:36:41.026]  And that's why all the police officers that you saw up there, who are a shame to the badge, who are a shame to the uniform, these police officers are an embarrassment to the uniform, to the badge, and to the United States of America.
[01:36:41.466 --> 01:36:47.950]  But they're Democrat Party operatives, they hate Donald Trump, they hate America, so they're down with the program.
[01:36:49.403 --> 01:36:50.784]  So that's what this is all about.
[01:36:50.904 --> 01:37:00.809]  Their hatred for Donald Trump, their hatred for America, and they think that this is going to be their big come up moment to finally arrest Donald Trump.
[01:37:01.749 --> 01:37:04.050]  That's what this is all about.
[01:37:04.871 --> 01:37:09.513]  And so, but let's go to the receipts now.
[01:37:11.214 --> 01:37:13.335]  Let's go to the receipts now.
[01:37:14.135 --> 01:37:19.018]  And of course, I'll show you how, I mean, it's not, it's unintentional irony.
[01:37:20.615 --> 01:37:22.497]  Are the cops good or are the cops bad?
[01:37:22.577 --> 01:37:28.623]  Because for 364 days of the year, according to the Democrat Party and the left, the cops are bad.
[01:37:29.624 --> 01:37:36.151]  But yesterday the cops were good because they had their right corrupt cops saying the things they wanted to say on national TV.
[01:37:36.411 --> 01:37:38.073]  So for one day the cops were good.
[01:37:39.349 --> 01:37:41.850]  Or I guess the cops were maybe good on January 6th, too?
[01:37:42.110 --> 01:37:42.371]  Maybe?
[01:37:42.511 --> 01:37:43.551]  I don't know.
[01:37:43.591 --> 01:37:47.493]  The cops are only good when they're working for a Democrat Party agenda.
[01:37:47.953 --> 01:37:49.654]  Every other day of the year, the cops are bad.
[01:37:49.754 --> 01:37:53.236]  Kill a cop, murder a cop, kill a pig, whatever, the Democrats are all behind it.
[01:37:53.276 --> 01:37:57.178]  But oh, when they can use cops for their message, then they love cops all of a sudden.
[01:37:57.538 --> 01:37:58.258]  But I digress.
[01:37:59.179 --> 01:38:01.000]  We have all the receipts here.
[01:38:02.662 --> 01:38:10.009]  From all of these corrupt police officers, but specifically the one that they really liked using up there, Officer Harry Dunn.
[01:38:10.429 --> 01:38:20.279]  So here's the big Democrat lawyer, Mark Zaid, who tried to do all kinds of cases against Donald Trump, took a bunch of L's, but he's still there.
[01:38:20.962 --> 01:38:27.326]  Very proud of my Capitol Police Officers Dunn and Gonnell today, as well as Fanon and Hodges.
[01:38:27.386 --> 01:38:30.808]  Thank you all for defending democracy, as they stole the election.
[01:38:31.369 --> 01:38:37.133]  So they steal the election, and then they lie to the American people about it, and this corrupt lawyer says that it's all good.
[01:38:38.574 --> 01:38:39.534]  But here's the receipts.
[01:38:43.076 --> 01:38:45.078]  For Officer Harry Dunn.
[01:38:52.503 --> 01:39:01.145]  He says he supported the riots in Kenosha, said, why is murder an appropriate response to property damage, but property damage isn't appropriate response to murder?
[01:39:02.105 --> 01:39:03.345]  So he doesn't stand with the police.
[01:39:03.365 --> 01:39:04.266]  He's not a police officer.
[01:39:04.686 --> 01:39:06.006]  He's a Democrat Party operative.
[01:39:07.086 --> 01:39:15.268]  He celebrates the riots in Kenosha that led to multiple people being shot and killed and including police officers being injured.
[01:39:15.468 --> 01:39:17.108]  And he says it's an appropriate response.
[01:39:17.308 --> 01:39:19.589]  What happened in Kenosha was an appropriate response.
[01:39:24.158 --> 01:39:38.341]  Here's Officer Harry Dunn celebrating when Donald Trump had to be rushed off the stage during a campaign event because a radical leftist charged the stage and threatened to kill him.
[01:39:38.861 --> 01:39:41.122]  There's Harry Dunn celebrating that right here.
[01:39:41.162 --> 01:39:46.823]  Here he is celebrating Donald Trump being rushed off the stage because a deranged leftist attacked him.
[01:39:47.463 --> 01:39:49.083]  Again, this is not a police officer.
[01:39:49.604 --> 01:39:51.184]  This is a Democrat Party operative.
[01:39:52.130 --> 01:40:01.259]  Here's Harry Dunn denying that Trump ever won the election and saying, nope, it was actually Trump lost, but Obama's my real president.
[01:40:02.680 --> 01:40:09.126]  Here he is saying how racist America is, saying Trump's racist, saying how he stands with Ilhan Omar.
[01:40:10.668 --> 01:40:12.390]  Here he is attacking Donald Trump again.
[01:40:14.150 --> 01:40:17.171]  Again, I mean, I have all the receipts here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:40:17.691 --> 01:40:21.633]  Just understand, Harry Dunn is not a police officer.
[01:40:22.253 --> 01:40:27.135]  Harry Dunn is a Democrat Party activist that the Democrats have launched against Donald Trump.
[01:40:28.197 --> 01:40:31.800]  I come to you with very grave news, but at least now the enemy's out in the open.
[01:40:32.301 --> 01:40:42.670]  We've confirmed all over the world the United Nations is directing a program to arrest people who refuse to be inoculated with the experimental Nuremberg-violating COVID-19 so-called vaccines.
[01:40:43.250 --> 01:40:49.176]  Yes, they're now coming to begin arresting us and taking us to giant emergency centers that have been built all over the world.
[01:40:49.536 --> 01:40:51.458]  This is the New World Order out in the open.
[01:40:52.120 --> 01:40:59.066]  You can see behind me through this car, Croix-Rouge Français, COVID center, COVID parking, COVID reception.
[01:40:59.086 --> 01:41:13.659]  This is where we take a number of young people who are in close contact, who are positive, and that we place here in these centers of this establishment, which is an agricultural establishment that has been reconverted for the occasion
[01:41:14.500 --> 01:41:17.341]  You know, they're informed about the side effects of the vaccine.
[01:41:17.421 --> 01:41:18.322]  A lot of people don't want it.
[01:41:18.362 --> 01:41:21.023]  You know, a lot of people are getting it just because they feel forced to.
[01:41:21.063 --> 01:41:24.244]  And people that do not want it, they're being put into detention camps.
[01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:45.083]  The plan of tyrants is always simple.
[01:41:45.603 --> 01:41:48.207]  Have complete power and control over the population.
[01:41:48.687 --> 01:41:57.559]  And if you have the power to target anybody you want in the population and claim that somehow they're a criminal or somehow they're diseased, then you truly have set up a dictatorship.
[01:41:58.120 --> 01:42:00.943]  That's what's happening now, a worldwide medical dictatorship.
[01:42:01.243 --> 01:42:09.572]  It's now being confirmed across the world under UN directives, new lockdowns have begun that are starving to people en masse by the tens of millions.
[01:42:09.772 --> 01:42:17.501]  The last lockdown already starved over 20 million extra people, the UN admits, with an additional 280 plus million set to starve to death.
[01:42:18.081 --> 01:42:19.462]  Once this new lockdown gets going.
[01:42:19.943 --> 01:42:22.805]  So in the first world, we just sit at home and watch Netflix and get deeper debt.
[01:42:23.125 --> 01:42:28.130]  But that's just part of the new, huge breaking developments taking place across this planet.
[01:42:28.710 --> 01:42:36.417]  Under, again, United Nations directives in Australia, in Canada, in the UK, in Germany, in France, and many other areas.
[01:42:37.117 --> 01:42:40.900]  They are arresting people by the thousands and thousands and thousands.
[01:42:41.801 --> 01:42:50.943]  Because their smartphone had secret government and other apps on it that claims they came in contact or may have come in contact with someone with COVID-19.
[01:42:51.463 --> 01:43:02.024]  And so the government shows up at your house, takes you in a van to a quarantine center for a week, two weeks, three weeks, sometimes longer, and in many cases forces medical treatments on you.
[01:43:02.324 --> 01:43:04.445]  This is what the UN said a year ago was the Holy Grail.
[01:43:04.845 --> 01:43:10.666]  Dr. Ryan, the head of the UN Rapid Reaction Force, said, we want to go in the houses where the COVID is and take these families out.
[01:43:11.347 --> 01:43:15.422]  It is a more cost-effective intervention to separate
[01:43:17.723 --> 01:43:22.784]  Some individuals from society then separate everybody in society from each other.
[01:43:23.264 --> 01:43:44.430]  However, where there is not a good handle, where there hasn't been a good understanding of disease transmission, where enough has not been invested in core public health interventions such as case finding and contact tracing, then social distancing measures may be your only option to create distance between individuals.
[01:43:44.861 --> 01:43:59.450]  I'm also announcing the formation of Strike Force Seasoned, which will see 22 detectives work from now until whenever it concludes, identifying as many people as possible who attended today's incident and have them charged.
[01:43:59.750 --> 01:44:05.033]  Rosen will outline five areas his team is focused on to get more Americans vaccinated.
[01:44:05.653 --> 01:44:15.719]  One, targeted community-by-community, door-to-door outreach to get remaining Americans vaccinated by ensuring they have the information they need on how both safe and accessible the vaccine is.
[01:44:16.079 --> 01:44:25.785]  By partnering with local leaders, governors, mayors, doctors, school administrators, employers, faith leaders, and community organizers.
[01:44:27.206 --> 01:44:29.307]  Leaders that people know and trust.
[01:44:30.837 --> 01:44:33.759]  One shot at a time, one person at a time.
[01:44:34.059 --> 01:44:35.159]  You need to react quickly.
[01:44:35.920 --> 01:44:37.140]  You need to go after the virus.
[01:44:37.601 --> 01:44:39.322]  You need to stop the chains of transmission.
[01:44:39.662 --> 01:44:41.983]  You need to engage with communities very deeply.
[01:44:42.043 --> 01:44:43.804]  Community acceptance is hugely important.
[01:44:44.124 --> 01:44:45.285]  You need to be coordinated.
[01:44:45.305 --> 01:44:46.305]  You need to be coherent.
[01:44:46.766 --> 01:44:50.908]  You need to look at the other sectoral impacts, schools and security and economic.
[01:44:51.348 --> 01:44:59.152]  That's one of the reasons we initiated these strike forces, to go into communities and work with them to determine what they need.
[01:44:59.212 --> 01:45:04.375]  To take a localized, specific approach that works with elected officials in communities.
[01:45:04.575 --> 01:45:11.860]  Meantime, cities and counties are staffing strike teams to help vaccinate people who cannot get to clinics and drive-through sites on their own.
[01:45:11.960 --> 01:45:15.041]  King 5's Ted Lantanite followed a crew from the Seattle Fire Department.
[01:45:15.061 --> 01:45:15.862]  He joins us live.
[01:45:15.902 --> 01:45:19.364]  And Ted, we're hearing that they're working seven days a week on this, right?
[01:45:21.072 --> 01:45:26.474]  Yeah, Mark, that's what it takes to vaccinate the most at-risk patients as quickly as possible.
[01:45:26.494 --> 01:45:28.114]  You have to go right to their homes.
[01:45:28.595 --> 01:45:31.215]  Anyone who's involved in emergency response will know this.
[01:45:32.156 --> 01:45:35.937]  If you need to be right before you move, you will never win.
[01:45:37.838 --> 01:45:41.799]  Perfection is the enemy of the good when it comes to emergency management.
[01:45:42.599 --> 01:45:44.380]  Speed trumps perfection.
[01:45:45.413 --> 01:45:50.516]  Even though they know it's based on the PCR test, it's almost 100% false positives.
[01:45:50.717 --> 01:45:54.799]  They can then again, turn it up to any level they want to disappear whoever they want.
[01:45:54.879 --> 01:45:55.640]  And then it gets worse.
[01:45:56.420 --> 01:46:14.372]  This is then used as their entire contact tracing system as the basis of a worldwide surveillance system and a social credit score in Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates, his own words to track and trace every purchase you make and everything you do and to charge you carbon credits on a carbon allotment.
[01:46:14.412 --> 01:46:15.193]  So understand this.
[01:46:15.813 --> 01:46:28.865]  They were arresting people all over the world because the computer or the contact tracing system or GPS claims you got near somebody while borders of the US and Europe are wide open to influxes of people who aren't even being tested.
[01:46:29.125 --> 01:46:32.628]  Now all of that's huge news, but here is the biggest news.
[01:46:33.469 --> 01:46:38.434]  We have confirmed that in France and we have confirmed in areas of northern Europe
[01:46:39.352 --> 01:46:52.821]  They are telling the general population that if you do not take the so-called COVID inoculation, that is an experimental vaccine that violates the Nuremberg Code, you won't just be locked in your house, you won't just have your kids taken, you won't just not be able to go to your job.
[01:46:52.901 --> 01:46:56.503]  This is what they're saying on CNN, they want to do here in the United States, what Governor Newsom's saying.
[01:46:57.224 --> 01:46:57.344]  No.
[01:46:58.271 --> 01:47:12.296]  They're saying they're going to take you and indefinitely lock you up in a facility because you're a dangerous spreader, because you didn't let them take over your immune system and put this into your body when it's experimental and they've had to put advisories on it that it causes blood clots, heart attacks, and strokes.
[01:47:12.416 --> 01:47:13.597]  I mean, this is it.
[01:47:13.697 --> 01:47:14.497]  Everything we always said.
[01:47:14.517 --> 01:47:18.539]  They'll release a virus, they'll create fear, they'll promote forced inoculations.
[01:47:19.759 --> 01:47:24.543]  I'm here at Lake Tahoe on a workcation and doing a lot of research, meeting a lot of people.
[01:47:25.103 --> 01:47:40.354]  Went out fishing and swimming yesterday, rented a boat with a captain, and he began to tell me about his family in Europe, because he was born in Northern Europe and lives here most of his life, that is being told, you will go to a COVID facility if you do not take these injections.
[01:47:40.555 --> 01:47:43.557]  And then, of course, the injections don't work because the tests are all fake.
[01:47:44.077 --> 01:47:45.718]  People are still going to get cold, still going to get flu.
[01:47:46.039 --> 01:47:47.620]  So it's an endless problem that can never be defeated.
[01:47:47.920 --> 01:47:48.881]  And then I'll show you a clip
[01:47:49.441 --> 01:48:11.977]  out of France where again they're beta testing it on 20 somethings locking them up as well just because they claim that the tracker system on their phone claims they came in contact with someone this is the perfect pretext for roundup for control and for total surveillance and it's not coming it's here and the second lockdowns are being announced around the world and being prepared here in the United States we never really left the main lockdown
[01:48:12.757 --> 01:48:15.378]  If they get us back into phase two, we will never leave it.
[01:48:15.398 --> 01:48:16.579]  It will only get more intense.
[01:48:16.879 --> 01:48:19.000]  That is the United Nations and the Globalist's own plan.
[01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:22.281]  So please, take this report, research it for yourself and understand.
[01:48:22.601 --> 01:48:25.343]  We must declare independence against medical apartheid.
[01:48:25.663 --> 01:48:33.907]  We must declare independence against medical dictatorship and tyranny and the Fortune 100 corporations that control the UN and the media that are selling this giant lie.
[01:48:34.327 --> 01:48:35.707]  It is science to ask questions.
[01:48:36.068 --> 01:48:37.728]  It is science to have medical choices.
[01:48:38.068 --> 01:48:40.269]  It is science that it's my body, my choice.
[01:48:40.289 --> 01:48:41.010]  And what they're doing
[01:48:42.014 --> 01:48:43.755]  Listeners and viewers know that I'm on vacation.
[01:48:43.775 --> 01:48:45.336]  And believe me, I want to be on vacation.
[01:48:45.817 --> 01:48:46.177]  But I can't be.
[01:49:08.206 --> 01:49:18.743]  Because even the nice boat we rented, the nice captain driving it, has incredible reports of people being put in detention centers who are refusing the vaccine.
[01:49:19.284 --> 01:49:20.285]  He doesn't want to be on camera.
[01:49:21.658 --> 01:49:21.738]  And
[01:49:41.701 --> 01:49:42.621]  He's from Scandinavia.
[01:49:43.081 --> 01:49:44.682]  He's lived here in the United States most of his life.
[01:49:45.222 --> 01:49:49.463]  His family in Denmark right now that are calling him, telling him this information.
[01:49:49.483 --> 01:49:55.805]  So we're just going to shoot him from the side here and he's going to lay out the information that he is learning and what he's finding out.
[01:49:55.845 --> 01:49:59.066]  So sir, please tell us what is unfolding in your home country.
[01:49:59.997 --> 01:50:03.519]  So yeah, people that are refusing the vaccine are being put into camps.
[01:50:05.240 --> 01:50:06.160]  It's unbelievable.
[01:50:06.301 --> 01:50:09.883]  There's no sense or rhyme or reason to it.
[01:50:10.143 --> 01:50:11.183]  I don't know what to say.
[01:50:11.243 --> 01:50:13.885]  I'm happy I'm not over there.
[01:50:14.225 --> 01:50:15.966]  Tell us about your family, what they're telling you has happened.
[01:50:17.296 --> 01:50:21.482]  Um, you know, they're informed about the side effects of the vaccine.
[01:50:21.502 --> 01:50:22.524]  A lot of people don't want it.
[01:50:22.544 --> 01:50:25.448]  You know, a lot of people are getting it just because they feel forced to.
[01:50:26.309 --> 01:50:30.455]  And people that do not want it, they're being put into detention camps.
[01:50:31.016 --> 01:50:33.360]  And when they call you up specifically, what do they say?
[01:50:35.660 --> 01:50:40.904]  They're saying that pretty much they're being manipulated into getting the vaccine.
[01:50:41.045 --> 01:50:46.529]  There's a lot of alternate motivation behind getting it.
[01:50:46.549 --> 01:50:52.975]  There's travel restrictions, travel bans, people that don't have it, certain areas that you can go in that you can't go in.
[01:50:53.915 --> 01:50:54.636]  What are the details?
[01:50:54.656 --> 01:50:56.678]  They say people they know are being taken to camps?
[01:50:58.179 --> 01:51:00.761]  Not currently, but that's just kind of where it's going.
[01:51:00.961 --> 01:51:02.643]  That's the pressure that they're feeling.
[01:51:04.269 --> 01:51:06.370]  So are they specifically being told you'll be sent to camps?
[01:51:07.430 --> 01:51:07.811]  Exactly.
[01:51:07.831 --> 01:51:12.973]  I don't want to put words in your mouth because specifically you told me that's what they're saying is starting to happen.
[01:51:13.273 --> 01:51:14.294]  Specifically, what are they saying?
[01:51:14.314 --> 01:51:14.894]  This is important.
[01:51:16.243 --> 01:51:18.224]  People that are not vaccinated will be put into camps.
[01:51:18.544 --> 01:51:19.604]  So that's what they're currently telling them?
[01:51:19.664 --> 01:51:20.844]  Yep, exactly.
[01:51:21.005 --> 01:51:24.346]  Is this on the news?
[01:51:24.366 --> 01:51:24.946]  I'm not sure.
[01:51:24.966 --> 01:51:27.387]  Right now it's just talk.
[01:51:27.427 --> 01:51:28.107]  It's just hearsay.
[01:51:28.547 --> 01:51:29.947]  And that's how authoritarianism works.
[01:51:30.548 --> 01:51:32.948]  A year ago is when we might not let you go to stores.
[01:51:33.008 --> 01:51:35.269]  Now it's, oh, we are going to basically lock you up.
[01:51:35.309 --> 01:51:35.929]  We need mandates.
[01:51:35.949 --> 01:51:37.770]  I mean, this is all over the world with the UN directing it.
[01:51:38.210 --> 01:51:39.270]  Yep, exactly.
[01:51:39.891 --> 01:51:40.891]  What does your family think of this?
[01:51:41.907 --> 01:51:43.968]  Um, I mean, they're still not going to get vaccinated.
[01:51:43.988 --> 01:51:47.469]  You know, they're going to do everything they can to avoid, avoid all that.
[01:51:47.849 --> 01:51:50.749]  You know, it's to them, it's a life or death, a matter of life and death.
[01:51:51.770 --> 01:51:56.271]  And, uh, you know, well, my point is this is an assault on people.
[01:51:56.351 --> 01:51:57.191]  This is experimental.
[01:51:57.231 --> 01:52:00.152]  It violates international and national law.
[01:52:00.692 --> 01:52:01.812]  And it's got all these side effects.
[01:52:01.832 --> 01:52:04.553]  Now they admit the PCR test is fake and all these side effects.
[01:52:04.613 --> 01:52:07.854]  And then it turns out India is not even 10% vaccinated because they know what's going on.
[01:52:09.264 --> 01:52:10.225]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:52:10.845 --> 01:52:12.026]  There's no proof.
[01:52:12.086 --> 01:52:13.927]  There's no proof that this is helping anyone.
[01:52:15.008 --> 01:52:17.029]  A lot of people are dying.
[01:52:17.369 --> 01:52:20.791]  You can't even really look up the death rate.
[01:52:20.951 --> 01:52:27.536]  If you try to look up online how many people have died from the vaccine, it's hard to even find a straight answer.
[01:52:27.596 --> 01:52:28.276]  Here's an example.
[01:52:28.336 --> 01:52:29.697]  Last week, it's an official graph.
[01:52:30.137 --> 01:52:32.559]  The mayor of Austin put a graph up saying 100% of Austin
[01:52:34.680 --> 01:52:37.102]  By the fall, we'll be in intensive care.
[01:52:37.602 --> 01:52:39.103]  Well, I thought half of Austin took the shot.
[01:52:39.704 --> 01:52:40.745]  Everybody else doesn't take it.
[01:52:41.025 --> 01:52:46.849]  It's a way to terrorize and have total control and make us take in our bodies what they want, when they want, and it's all based on giant lies.
[01:52:47.830 --> 01:52:50.772]  Yeah, people that are refusing the vaccine are being put into camps.
[01:52:51.813 --> 01:53:01.861]  These facilities that are, you know, trying to separate the people that think for themselves and the people that are manipulated by
[01:53:03.103 --> 01:53:07.024]  Their government, you know, it's a crazy thing.
[01:53:07.304 --> 01:53:09.665]  And I feel like it's not the last of it.
[01:53:09.685 --> 01:53:17.388]  I feel like it's going to spread, you know, hopefully it gets hopefully people catch on, you know, and and start thinking for themselves.
[01:53:17.908 --> 01:53:21.249]  But honestly, I don't think that's going to happen anytime soon.
[01:53:22.110 --> 01:53:25.051]  I think media has complete control of everyone at this point.
[01:53:25.071 --> 01:53:29.152]  And it's a it's a wild world.
[01:53:29.452 --> 01:53:31.753]  How surreal is it to get calls from your family like that?
[01:53:34.164 --> 01:53:35.424]  I mean, it's hard to believe, honestly.
[01:53:35.444 --> 01:53:38.025]  It's hard to believe that that's happening in Scandinavia.
[01:53:41.566 --> 01:53:47.048]  I've been to Denmark, and it seems to be a pretty free state for the most part.
[01:53:47.088 --> 01:53:52.029]  But to hear that that's happening in a place where I have friends and family living, it's hard to believe.
[01:53:52.370 --> 01:53:59.192]  Well, the Rockefeller Foundation in the last 50 years studied things and figured out the way to have an authoritarian takeover would be a virus or a medical tyranny.
[01:54:00.572 --> 01:54:01.173]  Yeah, I buy that. 100%.
[01:54:25.444 --> 01:54:25.864]  I think that's it.
[01:54:44.352 --> 01:54:47.934]  Tell people to think for themselves, you know, look things up, just don't don't trust media.
[01:54:48.595 --> 01:54:53.158]  And, you know, don't don't put poison in your body if you don't, if you're not sure what it is.
[01:54:53.178 --> 01:54:54.539]  That's damn good advice.
[01:54:54.559 --> 01:54:57.781]  You were saying your family's really concerned about the side effects, which I think are the main effects.
[01:54:58.301 --> 01:54:58.721]  Exactly.
[01:54:59.122 --> 01:55:03.584]  Yeah, it's I mean, that's that's exactly why they're they're advising everybody to get it.
[01:55:03.625 --> 01:55:09.028]  It's not if they cared about your health, they wouldn't motivate you with donuts and free tacos for getting vaccinated.
[01:55:09.428 --> 01:55:09.949]  Absolutely.
[01:55:09.969 --> 01:55:11.790]  I mean, you see how beautiful everything is out here.
[01:55:13.030 --> 01:55:17.634]  And folks have to understand to protect all the freedom our forebears fought for, we've got to stand up now in my view.
[01:55:18.775 --> 01:55:19.236]  Absolutely.
[01:55:19.256 --> 01:55:20.297]  Thanks for talking to us, sir.
[01:55:24.059 --> 01:55:25.260]  The situation is absolutely tragic.
[01:55:25.280 --> 01:55:31.727]  You can see behind me, through this car, Croix-Rouge Française, COVID center, COVID parking, COVID reception.
[01:55:31.807 --> 01:55:47.342]  It is here that we take a certain number of young people who are in contact, who are positive, and that we place here in these centers of this establishment, which is an agricultural establishment that has been reconverted for the occasion
[01:55:48.143 --> 01:55:49.024]  A kind of golden prison.
[01:55:49.144 --> 01:55:52.166]  With, as you can see, delimitations everywhere.
[01:55:52.206 --> 01:55:54.929]  With young people who are not allowed to go out.
[01:55:55.589 --> 01:55:58.171]  Who are completely isolated from the rest of the establishment.
[01:55:59.212 --> 01:56:03.836]  There is, over there, on the other side, it seems, young people, very young people.
[01:56:03.976 --> 01:56:06.938]  It's a holiday resort that would be in the right part, over there.
[01:56:08.061 --> 01:56:12.665]  So if it was so dangerous, why would we put young people right next to Covid cases and positive cases?
[01:56:13.025 --> 01:56:19.250]  In any case, the positive cases here, the Covid cases, are not allowed to go out, are not allowed to see their families.
[01:56:20.591 --> 01:56:25.355]  So going out, it's a pain in the ass, but you'll see the report we did, and we're going there right now.
[01:56:25.375 --> 01:56:26.696]  I'll take you with me.
[01:56:26.756 --> 01:56:31.260]  And so they're locked up here?
[01:56:33.802 --> 01:56:34.062]  Covid?
[01:56:34.462 --> 01:56:34.622]  Yes.
[01:56:35.143 --> 01:56:36.623]  Covid is a quarantine zone.
[01:56:36.723 --> 01:56:40.664]  It was requested by the state to create a quarantine zone for people who come back from vacation.
[01:56:40.704 --> 01:56:42.005]  And is it free of charge or not?
[01:56:42.085 --> 01:56:42.425]  No, no, no.
[01:56:42.525 --> 01:56:42.685]  No?
[01:56:42.745 --> 01:56:43.085]  No, no.
[01:56:43.185 --> 01:56:44.986]  No, no, even La Colonie gave us one.
[01:56:45.066 --> 01:56:47.846]  It's not free of charge.
[01:56:47.866 --> 01:56:48.287]  Really?
[01:56:48.327 --> 01:56:49.647]  No, it's... But why?
[01:56:49.667 --> 01:56:50.487]  Because of Covid.
[01:56:50.787 --> 01:56:51.087]  What Covid?
[01:56:51.188 --> 01:56:53.228]  We see that there is a Covid.
[01:56:53.288 --> 01:56:56.029]  Here, you have to follow the arrows.
[01:56:56.049 --> 01:56:56.809]  Come back.
[01:57:07.538 --> 01:57:08.120]  Are you ok?
[01:57:09.964 --> 01:57:10.305]  Yes, I'm fine.
[01:57:10.766 --> 01:57:11.227]  What's your name?
[01:57:11.267 --> 01:57:12.029]  What's your name?
[01:57:12.069 --> 01:57:12.810]  What's your name?
[01:57:12.830 --> 01:57:13.251]  What's your name?
[01:57:13.271 --> 01:57:13.933]  What's your name?
[01:57:16.178 --> 01:57:20.479]  So, we call people who are in contact with Covid-plus.
[01:57:20.519 --> 01:57:21.300]  Okay.
[01:57:21.680 --> 01:57:23.000]  What does Covid-plus mean?
[01:57:23.040 --> 01:57:25.741]  Covid-plus means that they are positive.
[01:57:26.221 --> 01:57:27.261]  They are positive?
[01:57:27.281 --> 01:57:27.381]  Yes.
[01:57:27.641 --> 01:57:33.323]  For example, if there are three Covid-plus, they must not get mixed up.
[01:57:33.363 --> 01:57:36.423]  So they sleep here, in the rooms?
[01:57:38.604 --> 01:57:42.845]  Yes, in rooms, because there's an internet.
[01:57:43.025 --> 01:57:46.345]  So they sleep in separate rooms.
[01:57:46.385 --> 01:57:51.206]  And then they can go out to do sports, but with the mask on.
[01:57:51.226 --> 01:57:53.106]  So they're young, for the most part, right?
[01:57:53.146 --> 01:57:53.567]  How old are they?
[01:57:53.807 --> 01:57:56.787]  Yes, yes, there we have one, I was between 21 and 25 years old.
[01:57:57.127 --> 01:57:59.228]  There are no younger ones?
[01:57:59.288 --> 01:58:01.348]  No, not at the moment.
[01:58:01.448 --> 01:58:02.388]  There are no younger ones?
[01:58:02.408 --> 01:58:07.509]  Because it seems that here there are young people who are also much younger.
[01:58:08.566 --> 01:58:08.706]  No.
[01:58:08.867 --> 01:58:13.010]  And they have the right to see their parents and everything?
[01:58:13.570 --> 01:58:13.730]  No.
[01:58:14.191 --> 01:58:15.472]  They don't have the right to see their parents?
[01:58:15.672 --> 01:58:15.732]  No.
[01:58:15.752 --> 01:58:17.353]  So they're isolated from their parents, in fact?
[01:58:17.854 --> 01:58:17.994]  Yes.
[01:58:18.054 --> 01:58:19.635]  And they're placed here by the prefecture?
[01:58:19.775 --> 01:58:20.456]  Yes, exactly.
[01:58:20.616 --> 01:58:23.378]  It's the prefecture that decides to take them and place them here?
[01:58:23.418 --> 01:58:24.038]  Yes, exactly.
[01:58:24.119 --> 01:58:27.001]  And how do they react, in fact?
[01:58:27.081 --> 01:58:28.282]  Are they cut off from their parents?
[01:58:28.302 --> 01:58:31.004]  They don't see their parents, they don't see their family?
[01:58:31.024 --> 01:58:34.367]  When they're young adults, it's not so good, yes.
[01:58:34.387 --> 01:58:36.368]  How long do they stay here on average, then?
[01:58:37.742 --> 01:58:38.362]  Well, one week.
[01:58:38.402 --> 01:58:39.403]  There's one week left?
[01:58:40.003 --> 01:58:40.204]  Yes.
[01:58:40.284 --> 01:58:41.404]  And then they come out?
[01:58:41.424 --> 01:58:41.785]  They come out.
[01:58:41.865 --> 01:58:44.286]  And there's nothing left?
[01:58:44.346 --> 01:58:45.427]  And then there are tests.
[01:58:45.487 --> 01:58:50.550]  Oh yeah, you have to do the tests and if... You have to do the tests and if they're negative, they can leave.
[01:58:50.570 --> 01:58:50.690]  Okay.
[01:58:50.990 --> 01:58:53.772]  And if they're still positive, they stay.
[01:58:53.812 --> 01:58:58.355]  Because it seems that there are some that are there for a long time, I was told.
[01:58:58.375 --> 01:59:00.777]  They stay there for quite a long time.
[01:59:01.673 --> 01:59:03.714]  It all depends.
[01:59:03.834 --> 01:59:14.976]  If the person arrives, is only in contact, and after a week is positive for COVID, she takes it for 10 more days.
[01:59:15.096 --> 01:59:17.697]  But after that, we don't force them.
[01:59:17.717 --> 01:59:19.417]  She takes it for 10 more days?
[01:59:19.437 --> 01:59:20.798]  Yes, she's confined.
[01:59:20.898 --> 01:59:23.538]  It's a term, a bit like prison.
[01:59:24.039 --> 01:59:25.199]  Yes, but that's my term.
[01:59:25.939 --> 01:59:28.300]  And you, personally, how do you react to that?
[01:59:28.340 --> 01:59:29.660]  Do you think it's normal?
[01:59:31.644 --> 01:59:36.052]  Well, there's still a protocol to follow, and then we do our job.
[01:59:36.072 --> 01:59:40.039]  But why do they stay here, not in their families and all that?
[01:59:40.059 --> 01:59:41.922]  That's something we have to ask the prefecture.
[01:59:43.573 --> 01:59:49.595]  And the profile of the young people who are here, who are between 20 and 25 years old, what is their profile?
[01:59:49.695 --> 01:59:50.696]  Are they students?
[01:59:50.996 --> 01:59:53.057]  Are they people who are lost?
[01:59:53.157 --> 01:59:54.757]  Are they people from the street?
[01:59:54.777 --> 01:59:55.578]  No, not at all.
[01:59:55.598 --> 01:59:57.538]  We had young people who worked in a camp.
[01:59:57.598 --> 01:59:59.719]  It seems that they could not see their families.
[01:59:59.739 --> 02:00:02.220]  So you confirm that once they are here, they do not see their families?
[02:00:02.700 --> 02:00:04.981]  No, but they can call them.
[02:00:05.021 --> 02:00:06.742]  Call them, but not see them, of course.
[02:00:06.782 --> 02:00:07.482]  No, not see them.
[02:00:09.723 --> 02:00:11.885]  I imagine that for them it must be a tragic situation, no?
[02:00:12.446 --> 02:00:12.626]  Yes!
[02:00:12.646 --> 02:00:16.009]  They are doubly troubled, these young people, today.
[02:00:16.049 --> 02:00:17.650]  Troubled in the sense of pain.
[02:00:17.670 --> 02:00:18.931]  Yes, yes, no, but absolutely.
[02:00:19.011 --> 02:00:20.933]  After that, it's like that.
[02:00:21.033 --> 02:00:23.996]  And at the entrance, they told you that it was going to accelerate, of course.
[02:00:24.016 --> 02:00:25.397]  There will be a lot more at the entrance.
[02:00:25.437 --> 02:00:26.338]  I don't know.
[02:00:26.358 --> 02:00:28.760]  Do you still plan an additional organization?
[02:00:28.840 --> 02:00:30.301]  Are they doing additional songs and all that?
[02:00:30.321 --> 02:00:30.722]  How is it going?
[02:00:32.423 --> 02:00:34.485]  I can't tell you because I'm not the person in charge.
[02:00:34.505 --> 02:00:35.467]  And what's the person in charge's name?
[02:00:35.487 --> 02:00:36.628]  The person in charge's name is...
[02:00:40.547 --> 02:00:40.707]  Okay.
[02:00:40.727 --> 02:00:42.508]  And what does he do at the prefecture?
[02:00:42.528 --> 02:00:44.088]  No, he works at the Red Cross.
[02:00:44.128 --> 02:00:45.688]  He works at the Red Cross?
[02:00:45.708 --> 02:00:45.808]  Yes.
[02:00:45.929 --> 02:00:48.049]  Because it's the Red Cross that organizes this?
[02:00:48.089 --> 02:00:49.229]  Yes, it's the Red Cross.
[02:00:49.289 --> 02:00:51.530]  It's a center of the Red Cross?
[02:00:51.550 --> 02:00:51.650]  Yes.
[02:00:51.670 --> 02:00:57.452]  Okay, so it's the Red Cross that, under the orders of the prefecture, organizes the whole thing.
[02:00:57.472 --> 02:00:57.772]  That's it.
[02:00:57.832 --> 02:00:59.432]  And manages the whole thing.
[02:00:59.612 --> 02:01:02.133]  He goes to get the young people at home and brings them here.
[02:01:02.153 --> 02:01:02.473]  That's it.
[02:01:02.733 --> 02:01:04.714]  That's it, it's the Red Cross.
[02:01:04.894 --> 02:01:05.154]  Wow.
[02:01:09.153 --> 02:01:12.295]  I'm curious about this, I'm not going to lie.
[02:01:12.335 --> 02:01:13.737]  I'm a bit hungry, but oh well.
[02:01:14.217 --> 02:01:16.299]  Thank you very much for your testimony.
[02:01:16.319 --> 02:01:18.260]  I'm just an employee.
[02:01:18.400 --> 02:01:18.901]  New employee.
[02:01:18.921 --> 02:01:22.304]  Did they have a hard time recruiting people here, or was it easy?
[02:01:25.406 --> 02:01:26.346]  I'm not allowed to tell you.
[02:01:26.366 --> 02:01:27.387]  How did it happen?
[02:01:27.407 --> 02:01:28.368]  Did you introduce yourself?
[02:01:28.428 --> 02:01:31.390]  I applied on Tuesday morning and I got hired on Wednesday.
[02:01:31.490 --> 02:01:32.251]  On Wednesday?
[02:01:32.291 --> 02:01:32.671]  Right away?
[02:01:32.751 --> 02:01:32.851]  Yes.
[02:01:32.871 --> 02:01:36.114]  Did you know that they were looking for a candidate?
[02:01:36.614 --> 02:01:36.975]  Yes, I did.
[02:01:37.015 --> 02:01:39.357]  Are they going to hire other people?
[02:01:39.437 --> 02:01:40.257]  Are they recruiting?
[02:01:40.297 --> 02:01:41.298]  I don't know.
[02:01:41.438 --> 02:01:42.079]  You don't know?
[02:01:42.099 --> 02:01:42.259]  No.
[02:01:42.279 --> 02:01:43.980]  Has this center been open for a long time?
[02:01:54.742 --> 02:01:56.343]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:02:24.787 --> 02:02:36.220]  If you would like a little more context there, we have the story is up at InfoWars.com.
[02:02:37.321 --> 02:02:44.910]  UN setting up massive COVID internment camp system for the unvaccinated.
[02:02:46.718 --> 02:02:55.624]  And then, of course, the video there with the Alex Jones report is available at InfoWars.com.
[02:02:57.366 --> 02:03:06.212]  And I've got some other news when it comes to COVID that I can kind of clear up here, but this is going to be my final segment before Paul Joseph Watson takes over.
[02:03:06.692 --> 02:03:14.197]  And then I will be back hosting the War Room, fulfilling my normal host duties from 3 to 6 p.m.
[02:03:14.277 --> 02:03:15.779]  So I'll get into more of this then.
[02:03:17.756 --> 02:03:37.310]  But you see, they had to, the globalists, the New World Order, had to find a way to justify putting in internment camps, readying them for political distance and political prisoners.
[02:03:38.651 --> 02:03:40.312]  And COVID has been the perfect excuse for that.
[02:03:41.917 --> 02:03:49.938]  So just like all these other massive power grabs that COVID has resulted in, that's just yet another.
[02:03:51.190 --> 02:03:55.873]  And, you know, people see that and they're kind of like, oh, you know, that's an eye opening thing.
[02:03:56.894 --> 02:04:01.537]  But you have to understand it's all been by design.
[02:04:01.577 --> 02:04:05.540]  And so, hey, you know, maybe now it's for unvaccinated people and some people go along with it.
[02:04:05.560 --> 02:04:08.442]  And then later, hey, you didn't vote for this person.
[02:04:08.462 --> 02:04:12.325]  We're going to we're going to say you have some sort of a mental health problem.
[02:04:12.365 --> 02:04:13.966]  And so we're going to put you in there, too.
[02:04:15.227 --> 02:04:17.409]  And, you know, the list is just going to go on and on and on.
[02:04:18.641 --> 02:04:23.264]  Any reason to throw you in and that's why we have to stop this now.
[02:04:24.345 --> 02:04:25.385]  Must be stopped now.
[02:04:26.766 --> 02:04:46.819]  Let me just do this before we go to this last break here in the third hour and then Paul Joseph Watson takes over because I didn't finish my coverage from the sob story method acting January 6th hearing that went on yesterday.
[02:04:49.022 --> 02:04:58.427]  Here's just some of the headlines that prove that Democrats didn't care about police then, and they don't care about police now.
[02:05:00.828 --> 02:05:12.533]  And the only reason why they brought those Capitol Police officers up there for the hearing is because they're not actually police officers, they're Democrat Party operatives and activists.
[02:05:14.096 --> 02:05:19.741]  If you've been listening to me for a long time, you may recall when I've been in the D.C.
[02:05:19.781 --> 02:05:26.167]  jail multiple times, and I get arrested for my political activism in D.C.
[02:05:27.068 --> 02:05:39.580]  And again, I'll just tell you, when I was brought in, when I was riding in on paddy wagons, when I was waiting and getting processed, when I was sitting in cells,
[02:05:41.935 --> 02:05:47.478]  I really don't even want to say this because I don't want to put a target on these officers back, but I mean, you deserve to know what's going on.
[02:05:48.698 --> 02:05:55.282]  I was told exactly what goes on and that there's essentially, I shouldn't say a civil war inside the DC police, but let's just say...
[02:05:56.564 --> 02:06:11.729]  There are good men and women inside the DC Police, Capitol Police, and they're well aware that a lot of their leadership are Democrat Party activists, and they're well aware that some of their fellow officers are Democrat Party activists, and, I mean, they apologized to me.
[02:06:11.809 --> 02:06:14.910]  They're like, oh, and I, you know, I'm sorry we had to do this to you.
[02:06:15.891 --> 02:06:17.211]  We're run by the Democrat Party.
[02:06:17.231 --> 02:06:19.652]  I mean, flat out, I was told that.
[02:06:22.913 --> 02:06:28.480]  And I was, you know, I had a wink and a nod on some other things, too, that they didn't want to say in so many words.
[02:06:29.221 --> 02:06:35.009]  But yeah, I was told that the Democrat Party runs the D.C.
[02:06:35.029 --> 02:06:35.389]  police.
[02:06:36.556 --> 02:06:38.517]  Specifically the ones that put down the orders.
[02:06:38.957 --> 02:06:50.444]  And you can tell who's who when I walk in there and the ones that want to treat me like garbage and the ones that want to scowl at me and laugh at me and torture me versus the ones that actually care and know that I was wrongfully imprisoned and are trying to be nice to me.
[02:06:50.604 --> 02:06:53.086]  It was very obvious who was who.
[02:06:53.946 --> 02:06:58.189]  And like I said, there were a couple that were real cordial and open and they just said, here's the deal, man.
[02:06:59.550 --> 02:07:02.671]  You're in a Democrat Party cell.
[02:07:03.372 --> 02:07:04.132]  That's what this is.
[02:07:05.802 --> 02:07:09.124]  And so yesterday they just showed you who they are.
[02:07:09.305 --> 02:07:12.527]  They just showed who the Democrat Party activists in the DC police are.
[02:07:13.388 --> 02:07:13.928]  But here you go.
[02:07:14.648 --> 02:07:17.631]  Just some of the headlines the Democrats didn't want to talk about or have hearings on.
[02:07:19.132 --> 02:07:21.774]  These are the police officers shot during the riots.
[02:07:21.834 --> 02:07:23.275]  Daily Caller story from last summer.
[02:07:24.542 --> 02:07:29.544]  And it gets into the dozens of police officers that were injured and even killed during the Democrat riots of 2020.
[02:07:30.644 --> 02:07:32.504]  Democrats didn't bat an eye.
[02:07:33.125 --> 02:07:37.326]  Las Vegas police officer paralyzed after protesters shoot him in the head.
[02:07:37.946 --> 02:07:44.008]  More than 100 New York Police Department officers injured in the protests since June 10th.
[02:07:44.148 --> 02:07:45.809]  Again, these are from last summer, these headlines.
[02:07:46.309 --> 02:07:49.910]  Federal officers in Portland may have been permanently blinded by lasers.
[02:07:54.195 --> 02:07:58.496]  Cop reports to roll call one day after being shot in Louisville riots.
[02:07:59.416 --> 02:08:00.977]  Okay, those were just from last summer.
[02:08:01.017 --> 02:08:11.120]  Now, Dana Lesh has put together an incredible piece, and she put a lot of work into this, so it's worth sharing all 26 pages here as I go to break.
[02:08:11.220 --> 02:08:16.601]  And Paul Joseph Watson, oh no, Dr. Andrew Kaufman, is that who's hosting the fourth hour today?
[02:08:17.482 --> 02:08:20.322]  I'm sorry guys, my earpiece went out, so I don't even know what's going on.
[02:08:22.967 --> 02:08:26.269]  So we have Dr. Andrew Kaufman actually hosting the fourth hour, that's great.
[02:08:27.069 --> 02:08:30.971]  But, before we do that, Dana Lesh put this together.
[02:08:31.151 --> 02:08:41.936]  The left's many January 6th, a compendium, the left trying to hold January 6th as relative to the years of lawless violence and destruction is the original Whataboutism.
[02:08:42.516 --> 02:08:52.121]  And in this 26-page report, she gets into all the leftist riots when they burned DC, burned Portland, burned New York, burned Philadelphia.
[02:08:52.541 --> 02:09:01.268]  Shot police officers, attacked police officers, killed police officers, paralyzed police officers, and how it was celebrated in the media at the time.
[02:09:01.609 --> 02:09:05.792]  But one event, one event is treated differently than all the rest.
[02:09:06.032 --> 02:09:08.894]  Hello and welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:09:09.055 --> 02:09:11.136]  I want to thank Alex for inviting me on.
[02:09:11.196 --> 02:09:19.043]  I'm Dr. Andrew Kaufman and I'll be your guest host for the next hour and I have some exciting news and some exciting things to talk to you about today.
[02:09:19.683 --> 02:09:42.837]  I'm going to be focusing on the Federal Drug Administration, the FDA and their emergency use authorization process because there's been some recent news with respect to the PCR as well as the vaccines and I'm going to help you understand the legal and historical context for this very important issue that's affecting your rights right now.
[02:09:43.297 --> 02:09:45.659]  So if we could bring up the first slide please.
[02:09:50.023 --> 02:10:10.351]  So what we have here, and I'm not sure if it's up, there it goes, is an announcement that the CDC, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is withdrawing its emergency use authorization request to the FDA for the PCR tests that were originally approved in February of 2020.
[02:10:11.724 --> 02:10:18.929]  Now this is quite significant because after that date, these tests will no longer be allowed to be used.
[02:10:19.449 --> 02:10:29.997]  And the PCR test has been the most widely used so-called diagnostic test for COVID-19 across the world and especially in the United States.
[02:10:30.657 --> 02:10:41.225]  And as we know, all of the tyrannical policies that restrict your rights and require you to participate with unapproved medical interventions are based on the results
[02:10:42.088 --> 02:10:42.849]  Of this test.
[02:10:42.989 --> 02:10:45.250]  So why is it going to be withdrawn?
[02:10:45.871 --> 02:10:54.037]  Well, the truth of the matter is that there are two different ways to get your product on the market for a medical device.
[02:10:54.117 --> 02:10:55.978]  And this test is a medical device.
[02:10:56.679 --> 02:11:02.203]  One way is the emergency use authorization and there are specific time limited criteria.
[02:11:02.783 --> 02:11:09.208]  But to have your device on the market permanently to be able to sell, you need to get formal FDA approval.
[02:11:10.146 --> 02:11:20.308]  And the manufacturers of this test realized that they would not be able to even apply for FDA approval because they do not meet the criteria.
[02:11:21.168 --> 02:11:30.931]  As I've stated many times, the PCR test scientifically is not really suited for diagnosing clinical disease.
[02:11:31.511 --> 02:11:37.692]  But aside from that, this particular test has never undergone what's known as validation studies.
[02:11:38.496 --> 02:11:44.578]  Now, validation studies are what actually prove that it measures what you think that it measures.
[02:11:45.179 --> 02:11:47.180]  So, why don't we go to the next slide, please?
[02:11:48.980 --> 02:11:54.502]  And here, what we're showing is one of the FDA EUA authorization letters.
[02:11:55.103 --> 02:12:03.026]  So, each time a product receives this emergency use authorization designation, which is different from FDA approval,
[02:12:04.048 --> 02:12:07.190]  They issue a letter to the manufacturer giving them this approval.
[02:12:07.230 --> 02:12:15.737]  And so here is an example of one of the PCR diagnostics from Ipsum Diagnostics LLC that was issued on April 1st, 2020.
[02:12:16.017 --> 02:12:20.200]  And I want to show this to illustrate some important things that it says.
[02:12:20.660 --> 02:12:32.309]  So first of all, if you look at the highlighted text where under indication at the top, you'll see that it is a approved or authorized for qualitative detection of nucleic acid.
[02:12:32.950 --> 02:12:34.891]  From SARS-CoV-2.
[02:12:35.331 --> 02:12:56.301]  Now nucleic acid is another word for RNA or DNA, but what this is specifying is that it can only detect genetic material that is said to be from this virus, but cannot detect the actual virus and also cannot detect the clinical state of being in a disease due to a virus.
[02:12:57.081 --> 02:12:58.202]  And the next slide, please.
[02:12:58.262 --> 02:13:00.243]  If we look further down in this
[02:13:00.914 --> 02:13:17.525]  Authorization level letter, sorry, you see the highlighted text again that is based on the totality of scientific evidence available at the time this was granted that, quote, it is reasonable to believe that your product may be effective in diagnosing COVID-19.
[02:13:17.985 --> 02:13:26.091]  So you can see that there's only the reasonability of a belief, not a fact or not knowledge, that the product may
[02:13:26.903 --> 02:13:31.846]  Right, which also means or may not be effective in diagnosing COVID-19.
[02:13:32.686 --> 02:13:36.168]  So you can see that this is not very strict criteria.
[02:13:36.828 --> 02:13:39.430]  Hello and welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:13:39.730 --> 02:13:42.891]  I'm your guest host, Dr. Andrew Kaufman, filling in today.
[02:13:43.712 --> 02:13:53.457]  So as I was stating before the break, we have this language in the authorization letter that puts a lot of doubt
[02:13:54.119 --> 02:14:07.140]  About if this product actually can successfully diagnose COVID-19 and we'll know that it's not required to prove that it can diagnose this condition in order to get this authorization letter.
[02:14:07.761 --> 02:14:09.283]  So let's go on to the next slide.
[02:14:11.670 --> 02:14:16.151]  Now here we have the specific requirements from the FDA.
[02:14:16.231 --> 02:14:26.215]  Now to get approval of IVD, which is in vitro diagnostics, that's any diagnostic test done in the laboratory, there are two pathways.
[02:14:26.475 --> 02:14:32.997]  Now the 510K is the abbreviated pathway, so it's the easiest way to get such a device approved.
[02:14:33.397 --> 02:14:35.859]  So I thought I would highlight that in this example.
[02:14:36.440 --> 02:14:47.030]  And you can see that the FDA requires, among other things, the analytical specificity and sensitivity of an in vitro diagnostic in order to be approved.
[02:14:47.470 --> 02:14:48.331]  So what is that?
[02:14:48.731 --> 02:14:50.193]  Let's go to the next slide, please.
[02:14:51.914 --> 02:14:54.777]  So I found an article here from the NIH
[02:14:55.780 --> 02:14:59.122]  That discusses what sensitivity and specificity are.
[02:14:59.542 --> 02:15:05.545]  And essentially what they are, are statistics that are based on the error value or the error rate of the test.
[02:15:06.106 --> 02:15:11.348]  And the sensitivity is how well it can detect something that may not be common.
[02:15:12.409 --> 02:15:19.473]  And the specificity is if there is a positive result, is it very specific or does it give false results?
[02:15:19.513 --> 02:15:25.176]  So these are essentially ways to measure accuracy or error.
[02:15:25.799 --> 02:15:43.304]  Now you'll see in the second column here that this article is specifically talking about tests in ophthalmology and it states, quote, A lot of this high-tech explosion involves diagnostic tests.
[02:15:43.384 --> 02:15:50.446]  Regrettably, there is sometimes a tendency to use tests just because they are available or because they are high-tech.
[02:15:51.328 --> 02:16:10.260]  Now this is a very key point here because we have PCR tests are very high tech in terms of molecular biology and according to the FDA there have been approximately 600 different diagnostics and therapeutics applied for emergency use authorization to the FDA.
[02:16:10.320 --> 02:16:13.943]  So this is quite a prolific field and a big money grab.
[02:16:14.263 --> 02:16:15.804]  If we could go to the next slide please.
[02:16:16.344 --> 02:16:18.586]  So this article further goes to stay.
[02:16:19.284 --> 02:16:25.508]  That in order to calculate sensitivity and specificity, you need to have a gold standard.
[02:16:26.969 --> 02:16:36.996]  Now it says the gold standard is the best single test that is considered the current preferred method of diagnosing a particular disease.
[02:16:37.516 --> 02:16:45.361]  So what we have to do is take our proposed diagnostic test that we're applying to the FDA for and compare it to a gold standard.
[02:16:45.993 --> 02:16:50.436]  In order to obtain the sensitivity and specificity calculations.
[02:16:51.117 --> 02:16:53.098]  And please advance to the next slide.
[02:16:53.879 --> 02:16:58.602]  Also, you can see in the second column, sorry, this should be one before I went too far.
[02:16:59.663 --> 02:17:00.943]  It talks about validity.
[02:17:01.524 --> 02:17:06.447]  And validity is the name for the study where you would compare this to a gold standard.
[02:17:06.808 --> 02:17:09.309]  And what it says here, it defines the validity.
[02:17:09.529 --> 02:17:14.553]  It is the extent to which a test measures what it is supposed to measure.
[02:17:15.427 --> 02:17:16.708]  Okay, so that's really key.
[02:17:17.088 --> 02:17:26.571]  So we have an experimental test we're going to apply to the FDA, but we have to do a validation study to show that it measures what we say it's going to measure.
[02:17:27.251 --> 02:17:39.416]  And in order to do that, we have to compare it to a gold standard and then use that comparison to calculate the error rate, as well as sensitivity, specificity, and other variables.
[02:17:40.196 --> 02:17:41.197]  Okay, next slide.
[02:17:42.694 --> 02:17:45.536]  What is the gold standard in virology?
[02:17:45.897 --> 02:17:51.281]  Now, we can't see this whole slide, but I'm going to read two quotes because I have two separate articles here.
[02:17:51.781 --> 02:18:11.736]  Now, the first is from an article about bovine viral diarrhea virus, and it says, quote, virus isolation is a basic, reliable, and widely used method for diagnosis of BVDV infection and remains the gold standard for the virus diagnostics.
[02:18:12.947 --> 02:18:21.373]  Okay, now we go to the second article which is looking at cytomegalovirus and I put a quote at the end right there.
[02:18:21.674 --> 02:18:23.515]  Culture is the gold standard.
[02:18:24.306 --> 02:18:36.956]  Now, culture and isolation are actually two names for the same experiment, and this is the experiment that I have criticized immensely as being not a valid way to identify a virus.
[02:18:37.437 --> 02:18:43.922]  However, according to mainstream virology, this is the gold standard of how they identify a virus.
[02:18:44.622 --> 02:18:46.324]  So, if you are going to
[02:18:47.310 --> 02:18:53.293]  Be able to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of such a diagnostic test like the PCR.
[02:18:53.713 --> 02:19:02.298]  And by the way, this applies to all of the diagnostic tests that have been put forth and have received emergency use authorization.
[02:19:02.778 --> 02:19:09.522]  That they would all have to be compared to a gold standard in order to determine all of these variables about their error.
[02:19:10.142 --> 02:19:15.485]  And that would require comparing them to virus isolation according to their own standards.
[02:19:16.181 --> 02:19:19.744]  Now, this study has never, not once, been done.
[02:19:21.966 --> 02:19:40.122]  So, in other words, they don't really have any basis whatsoever to get approval for the PCR test, so they have no choice but to withdraw their Emergency Use Authorization application, because when it expires, they will not be able to get approval.
[02:19:41.637 --> 02:19:43.138]  So this is quite significant.
[02:19:43.178 --> 02:20:02.025]  And now I want to show you how this applies to the research on the Delta variant, because this has been the big news story, the big point of fear across the world that this alleged Delta variant came from India and is spreading across the world.
[02:20:02.305 --> 02:20:07.388]  And specifically, it is the fault of the unvaccinated that this even exists.
[02:20:08.188 --> 02:20:09.869]  So next slide, please.
[02:20:10.269 --> 02:20:10.789]  I want to
[02:20:11.977 --> 02:20:21.183]  I want to point you to a video that I recently did, which has been put up on this website on Ban.TV.
[02:20:22.104 --> 02:20:29.308]  And I did this with Sayer G. And I explain exactly how they sequence the genome in this video.
[02:20:29.569 --> 02:20:31.670]  And I explain what variants are.
[02:20:31.850 --> 02:20:40.736]  And essentially, my main point is that they never had a virus where they could take the genetic material
[02:20:41.812 --> 02:20:41.872]  I'm
[02:21:00.240 --> 02:21:06.522]  Even though it didn't know the source of each of the 56 million little pieces, like did they come from a bacteria?
[02:21:06.562 --> 02:21:08.162]  Did they come from a different virus?
[02:21:08.222 --> 02:21:09.922]  Did they come from a human?
[02:21:10.002 --> 02:21:12.683]  Did they come from a yeast or a fungus or an amoeba?
[02:21:13.363 --> 02:21:20.585]  They had no idea, but the computer still was able to put them together into what they call an in silico genome.
[02:21:21.105 --> 02:21:25.126]  And this is a computer simulation of a genome and it's purely theoretical.
[02:21:25.766 --> 02:21:29.607]  And what variants are is when they try to repeat this experiment,
[02:21:30.405 --> 02:21:49.353]  By taking the sample from the lung fluid or from a nasopharyngeal swab, which is from the nose, and they essentially repeat this process and put it into the computer, and they compare it with the so-called index sequence that was the first one like this published.
[02:21:49.873 --> 02:21:56.616]  And what happens is that every time they do this experiment, they cannot get the exact same results.
[02:21:57.436 --> 02:22:02.561]  And the reason that they cannot obtain the same results is because it's not a valid study.
[02:22:02.581 --> 02:22:04.063]  In other words, it's theoretical.
[02:22:04.423 --> 02:22:10.249]  It doesn't represent the real genetic sequence of an organism, only a computer-generated sequence.
[02:22:10.849 --> 02:22:14.813]  So each time, the sequence doesn't match exactly.
[02:22:14.873 --> 02:22:15.834]  It's slightly off.
[02:22:16.535 --> 02:22:20.679]  And in order to account for this, they call each one a new variant.
[02:22:21.679 --> 02:22:27.563]  And then they arbitrarily, it seems, designate which variant is causing the problem.
[02:22:28.184 --> 02:22:29.885]  Now, they've named many, many of these.
[02:22:29.905 --> 02:22:32.567]  There have been tens of thousands.
[02:22:33.129 --> 02:22:33.409]  I think?
[02:22:55.698 --> 02:22:59.681]  That it won't be, they won't be protected from the Delta variant.
[02:23:00.081 --> 02:23:16.174]  So when we come back after the break, I'm going to take an in-depth look at one of the papers, the most recent study put out that claims that this Delta variant is so dangerous and in fact that it breaks through people who are vaccinated.
[02:23:16.794 --> 02:23:21.378]  So I'm very excited to present that to you and we'll be back right after this break.
[02:23:22.566 --> 02:23:25.066]  Hello and welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:23:25.387 --> 02:23:27.507]  I'm your guest host, Dr. Andrew Kaufman.
[02:23:28.247 --> 02:23:38.169]  Before the break, we have been talking about PCR testing and emergency use authorization and we were just getting into the Delta variant.
[02:23:38.729 --> 02:23:49.871]  I had given a description about how these genome sequencing experiments are done and how the Delta variant is essentially a made-up computer simulation
[02:23:50.620 --> 02:23:51.240]  of a strain.
[02:23:51.681 --> 02:24:07.169]  And let me add that since I was talking about the gold standard among the virologists of doing a virus isolation or tissue culture experiment, there have been no attempts at doing this type of experiment for any of the variants that I have found.
[02:24:08.075 --> 02:24:24.742]  So I wanna take you to the next slide, which is a study that recent, this is the most recent study, and I have it in front of me here, entitled Transmission Event of SARS-CoV-2 Delta Variant Reveals Multiple Vaccine Breakthrough Infections.
[02:24:25.563 --> 02:24:31.585]  Now this was done by doctors at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas.
[02:24:32.906 --> 02:24:35.747]  And what they said, and this is right here,
[02:24:37.139 --> 02:24:37.700]  Oh, you can't.
[02:24:38.240 --> 02:24:39.661]  Can you see it in this example?
[02:24:39.701 --> 02:24:42.203]  So I have a different version of this publication.
[02:24:42.243 --> 02:24:51.151]  But what it says here is that this study, quote, suggests Delta variant may possess immune evasion.
[02:24:51.171 --> 02:24:56.295]  Immune evasion means that it can make people sick who are already vaccinated.
[02:24:56.616 --> 02:25:01.740]  So you see that they have to very carefully hedge their language to say suggests and may
[02:25:02.963 --> 02:25:10.905]  Because they can't draw any clear conclusions from this poorly done scientific publication and study.
[02:25:11.745 --> 02:25:26.788]  So I want to give you the key points of how you can interpret this and obviously it is very fear-inducing to see that people now who put all their trust in a brand new so-called vaccine
[02:25:27.671 --> 02:25:36.717]  Have to now be afraid of getting the Delta variant and we know that the news media is blaming this on the unvaccinated that the Delta variant even exists.
[02:25:37.317 --> 02:25:43.941]  So we have a situation here that is potentially going to pit the vaccinated against the unvaccinated.
[02:25:44.402 --> 02:25:46.223]  So what are the key points of the study?
[02:25:46.763 --> 02:25:52.647]  So the first and most important point is that they used PCR testing
[02:25:53.635 --> 02:25:58.300]  To determine who was ill and who had COVID in this study.
[02:25:59.021 --> 02:26:08.151]  Now we know from the previous segments that the PCR test is not shown to actually diagnose COVID or SARS-CoV-2.
[02:26:09.375 --> 02:26:19.901]  And there has been no PCR specifically developed for the Delta variant that has been even given the emergency use authorization, let alone any approval.
[02:26:20.582 --> 02:26:28.887]  We know that the PCR test has not been validated, so any research based upon PCR analysis is thereby invalid.
[02:26:29.821 --> 02:26:37.006]  Now they also use the genome sequencing which is also theoretical and they use the same procedure that I described earlier.
[02:26:37.126 --> 02:26:39.048]  So that is also invalid.
[02:26:40.709 --> 02:26:45.012]  Now what they did was they followed people at a wedding.
[02:26:45.092 --> 02:26:50.056]  So I wonder if the investigators were guests at this wedding and got the idea to do this study.
[02:26:50.556 --> 02:26:56.741]  But two people from India came to the wedding and they tested negative on the
[02:26:58.832 --> 02:27:08.059]  Invalid PCR before they left India and then they got sick a few days after the wedding and supposedly they passed this on to four other people.
[02:27:08.579 --> 02:27:12.402]  Now, this wedding was not a wedding where human rights are respected.
[02:27:12.442 --> 02:27:18.566]  In fact, all the guests for this wedding were required to be vaccinated.
[02:27:19.106 --> 02:27:24.911]  So the couple that came from India got their vaccine just 10 days before they came to the wedding.
[02:27:25.691 --> 02:27:28.093]  Now, of course, it didn't point out
[02:27:28.897 --> 02:27:38.673]  That any of the other guests when they got vaccinated but we know that there were 92 guests and six of them fell ill.
[02:27:40.356 --> 02:27:43.220]  So they say that this is because
[02:27:44.019 --> 02:27:57.803]  The Delta variant, which they only identified using invalid testing protocols, was brought over by the couple from India and then spread to four other people at the wedding with whom they admitted having close contact with.
[02:27:58.463 --> 02:28:08.526]  Now, since all of the people at this wedding were vaccinated, why wouldn't we consider that the vaccines could actually be the cause of their illness?
[02:28:09.086 --> 02:28:09.646]  Now, if they
[02:28:10.433 --> 02:28:19.398]  Reported the timing of when the people who fell ill received their vaccines compared to when the other guests who did not fall ill received their vaccines.
[02:28:19.918 --> 02:28:20.659]  We could see.
[02:28:20.799 --> 02:28:36.047]  So, for example, if all six people were vaccinated within two weeks of the wedding and they're the only ones who got sick and the other people were vaccinated months earlier, then we would know that the vaccines were the cause of these illnesses.
[02:28:36.127 --> 02:28:38.108]  But this was not even considered.
[02:28:38.726 --> 02:28:55.899]  And this really follows a trend in medicine that investigators who perform medical research and this is especially true of doctors but also of PhD research scientists, they never consider that their treatment may actually be the cause of a negative outcome.
[02:28:56.479 --> 02:29:03.224]  This is something that is a big blind spot in this research and clearly needs to be addressed.
[02:29:04.495 --> 02:29:09.136]  Now, another fatal flaw of this experiment is that there is no control group.
[02:29:09.536 --> 02:29:18.179]  So, in other words, there's no other wedding where no one was vaccinated to see if any of those people got sick.
[02:29:18.259 --> 02:29:27.061]  And, of course, that would also tell us if the illness was caused by the vaccine because we would expect no one at the other wedding to be ill.
[02:29:28.192 --> 02:29:44.060]  So this is an example of the very poor quality of research that we have that is being used to manipulate and justify all the policies that we are facing here in this pandemic situation.
[02:29:45.061 --> 02:29:51.324]  So we really need to take a careful look at the systems that are put in place.
[02:29:51.944 --> 02:29:57.767]  And most of these systems are justified by the goal of protecting the public health.
[02:29:58.306 --> 02:30:06.129]  And they disregard anything about the individual situation or the individual's rights.
[02:30:07.110 --> 02:30:09.811]  So we have all kinds of fake news.
[02:30:11.092 --> 02:30:15.233]  And then we have, of course, the censorship that is coming.
[02:30:15.373 --> 02:30:16.654]  So recently,
[02:30:17.352 --> 02:30:30.780]  The Surgeon General of the United States gave a speech in which he talked about the major importance of misinformation and really this is because people are not running to get the vaccine.
[02:30:30.880 --> 02:30:34.122]  Pretty much everyone who wanted to get these vaccines I think has
[02:30:34.742 --> 02:30:35.462]  We're good to go.
[02:31:01.351 --> 02:31:15.038]  decided to fund millions of dollars to essentially help develop technology to further censor voices like you'll hear on this show across social media and other digital platforms.
[02:31:15.658 --> 02:31:25.983]  So we can see that our rights are being infringed upon in many different ways and information wars or info wars is one of the big
[02:31:26.573 --> 02:31:27.274]  Battlegrounds.
[02:31:27.975 --> 02:31:36.224]  So when we come back, we're going to shift gears and we're going to talk more about the vaccine situation in the context of emergency use authorization.
[02:31:37.005 --> 02:31:42.230]  Let me remind you that you're watching the Alex Jones Show and I'm your guest host, Dr. Andrew Kaufman.
[02:31:42.611 --> 02:31:43.492]  We'll see you in a few.
[02:31:44.474 --> 02:31:46.897]  Hello and welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:31:46.917 --> 02:32:00.451]  I'm your guest host, Dr. Andrew Kaufman, and today we've been talking about the PCR test, emergency use authorization, the Delta variant, and now we're going to shift into vaccine mandates.
[02:32:01.072 --> 02:32:03.094]  We could please have the next slide.
[02:32:06.301 --> 02:32:14.728]  And right here we have been hearing and this is one of the things that frankly bothers me the most about what's going on in the world right now.
[02:32:15.368 --> 02:32:34.183]  But we have employers, we have governments, we have universities and schools, we have school systems, we have hospitals and health care organizations all calling for mandates for their employees, students and associates and sometimes customers
[02:32:35.151 --> 02:32:38.192]  To get this experimental vaccine.
[02:32:38.913 --> 02:32:44.235]  So let's go back and talk a little bit more about the emergency use authorization.
[02:32:44.555 --> 02:32:45.396]  Next slide, please.
[02:32:46.336 --> 02:32:56.641]  Because every product that is being marketed and sold in the context of this pandemic is only been granted emergency use authorization.
[02:32:56.721 --> 02:33:02.624]  There are no products that have actually been approved as safe and effective by the FDA.
[02:33:03.337 --> 02:33:05.839]  So what is emergency use authorization?
[02:33:06.560 --> 02:33:16.827]  So under an EUA, FDA may allow the use of unapproved medical products or unapproved uses of approved medical products in an emergency.
[02:33:17.988 --> 02:33:28.356]  So it's unapproved products in an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions when certain statutory criteria have been met.
[02:33:29.051 --> 02:33:34.952]  Including that there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives.
[02:33:36.193 --> 02:33:51.476]  Okay, so let's look at this really closely because this is the context from which all of these products, including the vaccines, and now we're really talking here about the vaccines, and I want to explain that these are not traditional vaccines.
[02:33:51.536 --> 02:33:52.016]  In fact,
[02:33:52.714 --> 02:34:00.281]  The dictionaries of the world had to modify their definitions of vaccines to include this current technology.
[02:34:00.782 --> 02:34:07.208]  Now what these are is these are genetic based therapies or gene therapies and there are different kinds.
[02:34:07.428 --> 02:34:12.553]  I know that many of you have heard a lot of information about this but there are the mRNA
[02:34:13.368 --> 02:34:13.968]  We're good to go!
[02:34:38.328 --> 02:34:44.953]  And in fact, there are almost no gene therapies at all that have been granted approval for use.
[02:34:45.374 --> 02:34:50.217]  So we are basically combining two technologies here, vaccines and gene therapy.
[02:34:50.678 --> 02:34:53.940]  So there is no precedent for this.
[02:34:55.161 --> 02:35:01.006]  But nonetheless, let's look at the next slide because let's see, is there actually an emergency?
[02:35:01.718 --> 02:35:09.643]  Now, the federal government and the Department of Health and Human Services still maintain their emergency status and they've been renewing it every 90 days.
[02:35:10.183 --> 02:35:29.835]  However, among the states, you can see from the map in the middle that solid blue or dark gray means that those states are open and no longer have a state of emergency declared and you can see that it is practically every state except Hawaii.
[02:35:29.855 --> 02:35:29.895]  So,
[02:35:31.772 --> 02:35:45.943]  We have all of the states have lifted their states of emergency and that signifies that there is no longer the required context for EUA authorization according to the states.
[02:35:46.063 --> 02:35:55.431]  Now the the Health and Human Services Department needs to get in line with all of the states because that is their job.
[02:35:56.031 --> 02:36:00.915]  Okay, so if we go to the next slide, let's look at the other criteria.
[02:36:01.954 --> 02:36:07.440]  Is there an alternative treatment that is safe and effective?
[02:36:07.680 --> 02:36:11.444]  And I want to point here to this is a review article.
[02:36:11.504 --> 02:36:19.852]  Now, I don't know how it's possible to have a review article in such a short time because we've only experienced this pandemic for a year and a half.
[02:36:20.412 --> 02:36:24.657]  And a review article means it's reviewing all of the studies that have already been
[02:36:25.237 --> 02:36:25.577]  Done.
[02:36:26.057 --> 02:36:30.299]  And in this case, they have not just a review, but it's a meta-analysis.
[02:36:30.800 --> 02:36:46.787]  And that is a very powerful mathematical technique when they take multiple studies, but not just the studies, they actually take all of the data or the results from those studies and put them in one set of results, like combining them, and then they analyze that.
[02:36:47.047 --> 02:36:51.088]  And meta means that it's beyond the results of any individual study.
[02:36:51.489 --> 02:36:54.530]  This is like a summary of all the research on the topic.
[02:36:55.353 --> 02:37:01.756]  And we have one here for ivermectin in the prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19 in such a short time.
[02:37:02.276 --> 02:37:06.137]  And it said that there were 18 randomized controlled treatment trials.
[02:37:06.558 --> 02:37:14.501]  Now if we compare that with any of the vaccines that have been given authorization, they've only had one
[02:37:16.222 --> 02:37:18.223]  trial, randomized controlled trial.
[02:37:19.044 --> 02:37:21.305]  And it didn't even look at the important outcomes.
[02:37:21.405 --> 02:37:27.308]  But here we have 18 different RCTs that were combined into a meta-analysis.
[02:37:27.828 --> 02:37:31.010]  And if we read the conclusions, this is what it said.
[02:37:32.430 --> 02:37:42.075]  Meta-analysis based on 18 randomized controlled trials, treatment trials of ivermectin in COVID-19 have found large, statistically significant
[02:37:42.805 --> 02:37:48.647]  Reductions in mortality, time to clinical recovery, and time to viral clearance.
[02:37:48.727 --> 02:38:07.573]  Now, not one study of the vaccine used mortality as an endpoint, so we don't even know if lives are saved, but here we know from ivermectin that there is a large reduction in mortality, so a large life-saving benefit, and time to viral clearance.
[02:38:07.793 --> 02:38:08.253]  Furthermore,
[02:38:09.238 --> 02:38:25.029]  Results from numerous controlled prophylaxis trials, now that is prevention, so that is actually the same thing that the vaccine is designed to do, report significantly reduced risks of contracting COVID-19 with the regular use of ivermectin.
[02:38:25.750 --> 02:38:38.119]  So, we see here that not only is ivermectin proved to be effective at preventing COVID-19 infections, but also not only can treat it,
[02:38:39.491 --> 02:38:42.912]  And make you recover faster, but actually saves lives.
[02:38:43.073 --> 02:38:47.695]  And this has been proven by a meta-analysis, which is a very, very powerful analysis.
[02:38:48.195 --> 02:38:56.858]  So we see that the two criteria required for emergency use authorization, that neither of them have been fulfilled.
[02:38:57.739 --> 02:39:01.721]  When we look, take a closer look at what the research shows.
[02:39:03.061 --> 02:39:07.323]  Now I'm going to shift to a very shocking, but important document.
[02:39:09.157 --> 02:39:11.158]  Next, and this is on the next slide.
[02:39:11.718 --> 02:39:21.322]  Now, this is an opinion paper that came out on this issue of mandating the experimental vaccines for employers.
[02:39:22.023 --> 02:39:27.485]  So we have Donna Johnson, who is the acting assistant attorney general.
[02:39:28.628 --> 02:39:42.795]  Prepare this opinion as of July 6th and it's called whether section 554 of the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act prohibits entities from requiring the use of a vaccine subject to an emergency use authorization.
[02:39:43.215 --> 02:39:52.379]  So what that really means is can employers or schools require in order to receive certain services
[02:39:53.137 --> 02:39:53.757]  I don't know.
[02:40:14.400 --> 02:40:19.162]  But it's really fascinating, the reasoning, and we're going to certainly go into detail.
[02:40:19.682 --> 02:40:25.884]  But one of the things that needs to be clear is that you have to look just at the context of this opinion.
[02:40:25.985 --> 02:40:27.565]  So first of all, this is an opinion.
[02:40:28.065 --> 02:40:31.107]  It has not been adjudicated in a courtroom setting.
[02:40:31.587 --> 02:40:39.930]  Okay, this is prepared by the Deputy Counsel to the President in order to advise the President on policy decisions.
[02:40:40.070 --> 02:40:42.131]  Okay, so this is not binding in court.
[02:40:42.881 --> 02:40:49.942]  In other words, if you were an employee required by your employer to get the vaccine, you could still sue them.
[02:40:50.762 --> 02:40:54.703]  This opinion does not have any effect over any individual.
[02:40:54.803 --> 02:40:57.864]  So we need to take it very carefully with a grain of salt.
[02:40:58.424 --> 02:41:06.885]  And I'm also going to look a little bit into the background of Donna Johnson who prepared the report to see what her motivations might be.
[02:41:06.905 --> 02:41:11.106]  So we're going to explore this further and then talk a bit about
[02:41:12.512 --> 02:41:15.114]  about human subject research when we come back.
[02:41:15.635 --> 02:41:20.238]  And this is the Alex Jones Show, and I'm your guest host, Dr. Andrew Kaufman.
[02:41:20.359 --> 02:41:21.239]  We'll see you in a few.
[02:41:22.080 --> 02:41:22.560]  Hello!
[02:41:23.481 --> 02:41:25.283]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:41:25.303 --> 02:41:28.025]  I'm your host, Dr. Andrew Kaufman.
[02:41:28.325 --> 02:41:36.512]  And before the break, we were talking about the judicial opinion of the Deputy Counsel to the President, Donna Johnson.
[02:41:37.525 --> 02:41:52.088]  About whether it is legal according to the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act to have employers or universities and schools require or mandate vaccination as a condition of employment.
[02:41:53.088 --> 02:42:05.070]  And so I want to explain the major point of this opinion paper, which is that in the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act,
[02:42:05.555 --> 02:42:31.629]  Section 564, which describes the emergency use authorization requirements and procedures, that there is language that says that people who would receive the experimental authorized product should be informed of certain things and that they should have the, quote, the option to accept or refuse administration of the product.
[02:42:32.493 --> 02:42:46.964]  Now, what the main argument is in this position paper is that it's only the responsibility of the drug companies themselves to actually let the person accept or refuse.
[02:42:47.044 --> 02:42:58.793]  But a third party, such as an employer or a university, they can require the person to accept because they are not specifically named in the FDA's documents.
[02:42:59.284 --> 02:43:02.865]  Now this is quite interesting that they would parse it this way.
[02:43:03.385 --> 02:43:14.228]  Now they also stated that this argument only applies to the specific section of the law governing emergency use authorization.
[02:43:14.408 --> 02:43:23.631]  In other words, it doesn't take into account any other federal, state, or local laws or international treaties.
[02:43:24.460 --> 02:43:38.711]  And we have, you know, a hierarchy of law in the United States, which is that treaties are the highest because our country is participating in that and it supersedes United States law.
[02:43:39.251 --> 02:43:42.233]  And then, of course, the Constitution is the second most important.
[02:43:42.754 --> 02:43:50.699]  And then the United States Code, after that, of which this language that I've read is part of.
[02:43:51.260 --> 02:43:52.721]  Now, I want to draw your attention
[02:43:53.906 --> 02:43:54.006]  I'm
[02:44:14.056 --> 02:44:14.817]  We're good to go.
[02:44:32.603 --> 02:44:41.468]  And the court ruled in their favor and granted the injunction saying that they could not be required unless there was a presidential waiver.
[02:44:41.528 --> 02:44:55.636]  Now I want to explain this a little bit because we're talking about here not a regular United States citizen or a regular individual or man or woman like you or I, but we're talking about a service member and when you enlist
[02:44:56.457 --> 02:45:07.400]  Into the armed forces, you essentially sign away your rights and you become a subject of the armed services and no longer are you a free citizen of the United States.
[02:45:07.880 --> 02:45:21.643]  So what they're saying here is even though you're not even a free citizen, you're a subject of the armed services that they can't even force you to take an experimental vaccine unless there is a specific presidential waiver.
[02:45:22.418 --> 02:45:38.650]  And subsequently, there was actually some additional legislation passed that the presidential waiver can only be granted when there is a direct threat to national security that would not be protected unless the waiver was granted.
[02:45:39.170 --> 02:45:49.658]  So just to summarize here, we have even service members, according to the courts, cannot be mandated to have this injection.
[02:45:50.419 --> 02:45:58.064]  Now let's go to the next slide and take a little bit of a closer look at Dawn Johnson, who is the author of this opinion.
[02:45:58.664 --> 02:46:06.489]  And we can see from CPS News, if we look at the heading here, because she has served under prior Democratic administrations,
[02:46:07.389 --> 02:46:12.553]  Quote, Obama renominates pro-abortion Dawn Johnson to Justice Department post.
[02:46:13.014 --> 02:46:23.742]  Now, Dawn Johnson, who is a professor at Indiana University and graduated from Yale Law School, she has a long track record of being a big advocate of civil rights.
[02:46:23.922 --> 02:46:27.384]  In fact, she even worked for the ACLU in the past.
[02:46:27.885 --> 02:46:36.051]  She teaches constitutional law at the law school and has been a major, major advocate for pro-choice and abortion
[02:46:36.698 --> 02:47:01.617]  Right now it's quite interesting to look at the juxtaposition and the hypocrisy in these two policies because she spent her career protecting the right to choose for our body the privacy the integrity of our bodies that we can choose for ourselves because that is the basis of the Roe v. Wade decision that protects abortion rights.
[02:47:02.557 --> 02:47:04.399]  Now she has issued an opinion
[02:47:05.262 --> 02:47:06.965]  Saying the exact opposite.
[02:47:07.145 --> 02:47:20.986]  Now she says it's perfectly okay to force a experimental medical treatment on people for employers as long as it's not the manufacturer of the product themselves.
[02:47:21.838 --> 02:47:34.867]  Now imagine if employers were concerned about overpopulation and they decided that all their employees who became pregnant would have to get an abortion or be terminated from employment.
[02:47:35.227 --> 02:47:43.013]  Because that's precisely the situation that she has said is legal and okay to carry out.
[02:47:43.693 --> 02:47:49.237]  So this is, you know, quite a shocking and surprising change of direction.
[02:47:49.912 --> 02:48:09.538]  But let's go further to the next slide because really what we're talking about here is we're talking about forcing the experimental or the use of an experimental treatment on the population here and whether it's by a government, whether it's by the manufacturer or whether it's by an employer, it is still the same procedure.
[02:48:09.958 --> 02:48:16.680]  So here we have aspects of the Nuremberg Code because the Nazis did
[02:48:17.173 --> 02:48:44.737]  extreme amounts of experiments on their population and they did this without consent of course and because of these atrocities there was a trial and the results of the trial were made into the Nuremberg Code and one of the main provisions of the Nuremberg Code is to prohibit experimentation on people without their voluntary consent and it says
[02:48:45.441 --> 02:48:49.911]  That it is absolutely essential to have their consent.
[02:48:50.416 --> 02:49:02.763]  And in fact, as a researcher myself in academic medicine and in medical school, I learned about this when I had to do a special training with what's called the IRB or Institutional Review Board.
[02:49:03.143 --> 02:49:17.411]  And this is a network of boards that regulate and approve human subject research and they're set up at every academic institution, every hospital, every place that does human research in the entire United States and beyond.
[02:49:18.158 --> 02:49:28.524]  And I had to undergo this training where I learned that the Nuremberg Code was actually the reason why we were very very careful about doing research on human subjects.
[02:49:28.944 --> 02:49:33.847]  Now if you will go to the next slide because in the United States
[02:49:35.357 --> 02:49:44.504]  We have written this, and by the way, there's also the Declaration of Helsinki, which is another document that sort of follows up on the Nuremberg Code.
[02:49:44.845 --> 02:49:53.091]  But in the United States we have the Belmont Report, which was prepared in 1979, and this is what set up the institutional review boards.
[02:49:53.772 --> 02:49:55.173]  And there's a quote on the right.
[02:49:55.734 --> 02:50:09.286]  Because some people may say that this experimental vaccines are not actually human research that they are a real treatment and this paragraph speaks specifically to that fact.
[02:50:09.807 --> 02:50:19.295]  So the fact that a procedure is quote experimental in the sense of new untested or different does not automatically place it in the category of research.
[02:50:19.615 --> 02:50:21.137]  That's what I was talking about.
[02:50:21.932 --> 02:50:31.018]  Radically new procedures of this description should, however, be made the object of formal research at an early stage in order to determine whether they are safe and effective.
[02:50:31.078 --> 02:50:37.042]  So radically new procedures like a gene therapy vaccine.
[02:50:38.063 --> 02:50:40.645]  So in other words, this quote
[02:50:41.167 --> 02:51:01.246]  Directly applies to the current experimental vaccines that even though they are not regulated as research among the general population, they actually meet the criteria because the radically different technology that has been previously untested never used before.
[02:51:03.663 --> 02:51:16.478]  People, I want to just reiterate that we are in a time here when the major treaties, the major human rights declarations, and even our own laws and codes and statutes
[02:51:17.082 --> 02:51:33.507]  are being directly violated and it's being done out in the open and government officials are actually saying that it's okay that they violate the law and they use trickery like in this opinion document where they only look at it in the context of that one law.
[02:51:34.028 --> 02:51:39.649]  They don't look at it under any other statutes like the Developmental Disabilities Act.
[02:51:42.378 --> 02:51:46.442]  So thank you for listening to this complete and long discussion today.
[02:51:46.562 --> 02:51:49.185]  I'm Dr. Andrew Kaufman for the Alex Jones Show.
[02:51:55.885 --> 02:52:04.147]  Listen, folks, I cannot fund this operation without your support, and you've been great, and you've kept us on air, and you've gotten great products, and you've bought them again and again and again.
[02:52:04.607 --> 02:52:10.029]  But so many of our products have been sold out for two months, five months, six months, eight months, because of the supply chain breakdowns.
[02:52:10.489 --> 02:52:17.591]  So I really appreciate you helping with our shortfalls, buying books, buying films, buying t-shirts, at infowarestore.com.
[02:52:17.911 --> 02:52:22.492]  I just met with my accountants on Friday, and we're barely in the black.
[02:52:23.072 --> 02:52:23.672]  But you know what?
[02:52:23.772 --> 02:52:34.416]  Knowing what's going on in this world, and how the time is short, as the old devil knows, and they're accelerating their operation against us, and God, I need to expand, not just stay the same size.
[02:52:34.476 --> 02:52:41.358]  So, please understand we've got great products that you and your family need, and that your funding makes all this possible.
[02:52:41.898 --> 02:52:44.759]  Now, for several years, I wanted to get one of these in, and now we've done it.
[02:52:45.399 --> 02:52:46.440]  It's the highest rated.
[02:52:46.741 --> 02:52:54.490]  There are a lot of great super greens out there that are just made up of concentrated ground up cabbage and things like that.
[02:52:55.311 --> 02:52:58.875]  Those are great for getting extra roughage through your body.
[02:52:59.316 --> 02:53:01.538]  But this is a high end product.
[02:53:02.099 --> 02:53:07.543]  Green fiber capsules that comes from the very, very best products.
[02:53:07.563 --> 02:53:08.463]  Let me tell you what's in it.
[02:53:08.863 --> 02:53:18.029]  Introducing organic greens fiber caps, total amino acid supercharger, give your gut a reboot and a new lease on life.
[02:53:18.590 --> 02:53:21.992]  It's no secret that our unhealthy modern diets are slowly killing us.
[02:53:22.332 --> 02:53:29.377]  Most people are eating highly processed foods that are lacking high quality antioxidants, vitamins, enzymes,
[02:53:30.509 --> 02:53:30.609]  Yeah.
[02:53:49.631 --> 02:53:55.295]  It's made with seven organic greens that contain natural enzymes, that's key, for healthy digestion.
[02:53:55.315 --> 02:54:01.119]  Just one serving of the new Greens Fiber Caps contains as much fiber as three cups of iceberg lettuce.
[02:54:01.439 --> 02:54:03.160]  Again, fiber is just one thing.
[02:54:04.241 --> 02:54:12.307]  It's the type of fiber, from wheatgrass, flax sprouts, and a bunch of others, that have all the antioxidants, all the amino acids, everything.
[02:54:13.345 --> 02:54:15.686]  It's an excellent source of many different vitamins and minerals.
[02:54:15.827 --> 02:54:22.811]  Of its 17 amino acids, 8 are essential, meaning your body cannot produce them and you must obtain them from food sources.
[02:54:23.091 --> 02:54:25.092]  That's the concentrated wheatgrass.
[02:54:25.592 --> 02:54:32.317]  Flax sprouts are an excellent source of antioxidants, vitamins A, B, C, E, and all the essential amino acids.
[02:54:32.657 --> 02:54:34.098]  Calcium, magnesium, iron.
[02:54:35.501 --> 02:54:37.703]  Niacin, phosphorus, and potassium.
[02:54:37.723 --> 02:54:41.066]  This is the highest in product you're gonna get in a green capsule.
[02:54:41.847 --> 02:54:44.509]  This formula is loaded with five greens.
[02:54:44.669 --> 02:54:46.091]  Organic pea fiber.
[02:54:46.171 --> 02:54:47.312]  Organic alfalfa leaf.
[02:54:47.612 --> 02:54:48.733]  Organic cilantro leaf.
[02:54:48.833 --> 02:54:49.974]  Organic kale leaf.
[02:54:50.334 --> 02:54:52.316]  Organic... I always say that wrong.
[02:54:52.336 --> 02:54:52.837]  How do you say it?
[02:54:55.435 --> 02:54:59.016]  This is a high-end green fiber formula.
[02:54:59.396 --> 02:55:06.818]  Most brands derive their green fiber from the most inexpensive sources like processed lettuce, almost devoid of other nutrients.
[02:55:07.098 --> 02:55:11.499]  This formula is derived from high-quality nutrient-dense plants like wheatgrass and sprouts.
[02:55:11.879 --> 02:55:14.580]  Get the new organic green fiber caps now.
[02:55:15.100 --> 02:55:15.620]  We're good to go.
[02:55:38.516 --> 02:55:41.317]  InfoWars is a stay on the air, so it's a symbiotic relationship.

[02:55:53.363 --> 02:55:55.384]  Well, it happened last week, right after July 4th.
[02:55:55.845 --> 02:56:00.087]  World leaders across the planet and the UN announced a new world order.
[02:56:00.647 --> 02:56:03.348]  Global government to stop the spread of COVID.
[02:56:03.528 --> 02:56:06.970]  Oh, and they're going to have to surveil all your text messages on your private phone.
[02:56:07.370 --> 02:56:10.711]  And censor them if you question Fauci and the UN.
[02:56:10.751 --> 02:56:13.452]  That's because these criminals are going to go to prison.
[02:56:13.672 --> 02:56:14.712]  They released the virus.
[02:56:15.172 --> 02:56:17.253]  They have used the whole program to starve the third world.
[02:56:17.593 --> 02:56:26.435]  And they're now bringing in a worldwide ID in Klaus Schwab's own words with an implantable microchip as the next phase to be able to buy and sell or travel.
[02:56:27.015 --> 02:56:29.395]  So whether you believe the Bible or not, the Mark of the Beast is here.
[02:56:29.636 --> 02:56:31.396]  And our mission is now more important than ever.
[02:56:31.676 --> 02:56:33.597]  We make it easy to support InfoWars.
[02:56:34.037 --> 02:56:40.159]  One of our best sellers has been X2 Deep Earth Crystal Iodine that comes in two different packages.
[02:56:40.239 --> 02:56:42.260]  One with a spray bottle, one with a dropper bottle.
[02:56:42.620 --> 02:56:47.862]  It's both the exact same amount of iodine, it's the exact same bottle, it's just a different top.
[02:56:48.322 --> 02:56:56.705]  The spray bottle is selling out, but it's 60% off because I want those of you that have been big supporters to have it again, and I want those of you that have been on the fence to get it for yourself.
[02:56:57.086 --> 02:56:59.226]  And the dropper bottle is really close to selling out.
[02:56:59.627 --> 02:56:59.947]  It is 40% off,
[02:57:01.167 --> 02:57:01.447]  Thank you.
