[00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:19.622]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:20.143 --> 00:00:41.480]  The InfoWars crew came to Washington DC on September 18th because for months the mainstream media, the former deputy director of the FBI and others had said there was going to be just a huge terrorist attack there and that horrible evil racists were coming who supported the Capitol rioters.
[00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:45.472]  What they really supported was due process.
[00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:53.240]  Of the almost 600 people that have been charged, including our own Owen Troyer, almost all of them are completely innocent.
[00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.883]  They were waved into the Capitol by the Capitol Police.
[00:00:56.923 --> 00:00:57.744]  That's all on video.
[00:00:57.784 --> 00:01:01.608]  But Owen Troyer didn't even go into the Capitol.
[00:01:02.188 --> 00:01:07.531]  And because he'd been arrested before protesting Nadler peacefully, he refused to get on the bullhorn.
[00:01:07.791 --> 00:01:10.273]  I remember handing him the bullhorn and saying, I'm tired.
[00:01:10.633 --> 00:01:12.154]  Help me get the people not to enter the building.
[00:01:12.594 --> 00:01:14.435]  And he said, I'm not protesting.
[00:01:14.475 --> 00:01:15.095]  I'm not part of this.
[00:01:15.976 --> 00:01:24.281]  So in the arrest warrant for Owen, they show him down the road hours before on Pennsylvania Avenue.
[00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:26.880]  Telling everybody to be peaceful.
[00:01:27.101 --> 00:01:31.762]  So this is where we are in America where someone has been arrested.
[00:01:31.862 --> 00:01:32.883]  Someone has been charged.
[00:01:32.903 --> 00:01:44.707]  They're trying to put him in jail for years when he gave speeches legally on Pennsylvania Avenue and then marched the Capitol with me and tried to stop people going into the building.
[00:01:45.027 --> 00:01:46.447]  But this is bigger than Ellen Schroeder.
[00:01:46.487 --> 00:01:47.508]  It's bigger than Alex Jones.
[00:01:48.288 --> 00:01:49.929]  It's about all of us.
[00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:53.550]  If the system can grab citizens for misdemeanors,
[00:01:54.577 --> 00:01:54.797]  I think?
[00:02:15.014 --> 00:02:15.414]  I'm wrong.
[00:02:15.574 --> 00:02:17.135]  Like they're a POW in Vietnam.
[00:02:17.155 --> 00:02:28.742]  They would shoot down our pilots famously and then torture them for a year, keep them in solitary confinement, and then roll them out on TV to say America's evil, America's fascistic, communism's good, Ho Chi Minh is good.
[00:02:30.022 --> 00:02:31.683]  That's exactly what's happening here.
[00:02:31.743 --> 00:02:35.145]  Solitary confinement is a very, very serious form of torture.
[00:02:35.965 --> 00:02:42.369]  And it's very important to note that even a federal judge has come out and said almost all these charges are unconstitutional.
[00:02:43.337 --> 00:02:46.379]  Some of these people, like Owen, is being charged with entering the Capitol.
[00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:49.160]  They say breaking into the Capitol, not its grounds.
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.861]  They say the grounds and with force into the Capitol.
[00:02:52.242 --> 00:02:53.122]  And that's just not true.
[00:02:54.143 --> 00:03:02.467]  So again, this is a complete abolition of our Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:03:02.607 --> 00:03:04.768]  And I came here with an open heart.
[00:03:05.828 --> 00:03:11.751]  I predicted on air that it would be basically nonviolent, probably a few provocateurs, maybe a fistfight or two of some leftists.
[00:03:11.791 --> 00:03:12.472]  Andy showed up.
[00:03:13.192 --> 00:03:14.592]  But that didn't even happen.
[00:03:15.293 --> 00:03:21.114]  One person got detained, and I notice MSNBC and CNN are on the headline, armed man arrested by police.
[00:03:21.154 --> 00:03:27.215]  Of course, they never corrected that he was an undercover police officer, that one group didn't know who the other group was.
[00:03:27.856 --> 00:03:33.337]  The right hand didn't know what the left hand was doing, and so they detained him but later admitted he was an undercover cop and released him.
[00:03:34.077 --> 00:03:37.438]  So, we were told that if conservatives or nationalists
[00:03:38.098 --> 00:03:39.139]  Go out and protest.
[00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:41.321]  You're going to see incredible violence.
[00:03:41.341 --> 00:03:48.148]  You're going to see all hell break loose that these people were coming to carry out a quote, new insurrection.
[00:03:48.728 --> 00:03:58.517]  And the media goes on to say that the million people that showed up to see Trump speak at the Ellipse a couple miles down the road, that they all attacked and entered the Capitol.
[00:03:59.238 --> 00:04:07.462]  When it was less than 1% that actually entered the Capitol and less than 20% of those that actually engaged in any violence and that was wrong.
[00:04:08.223 --> 00:04:17.588]  But you see cases all the time where people burn down buildings and attack cops with hatchets and firebomb federal buildings and the charges against them in Kenosha
[00:04:18.717 --> 00:04:23.140]  Wisconsin and in places like Portland, Oregon and Seattle, Washington are dropped.
[00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:30.024]  And you see district attorneys put in by Soros that are admitted Marxist-Leninist that actually say these people are doing a good job.
[00:04:30.384 --> 00:04:35.848]  And you have Cuomo on TV on CNN saying that whoever said protesting had to be peaceful.
[00:04:36.368 --> 00:04:43.953]  And that burning down six, seven-story buildings, public housing, is a mostly peaceful protest.
[00:04:44.473 --> 00:04:45.574]  America sees
[00:04:46.354 --> 00:05:01.107]  This incredible hypocrisy and they see Nancy Pelosi and they see Maxine Waters calling for violence and calling for confrontation and then turning around eight months later while they hold these people Pelosi came out and said what was the exact quote?
[00:05:01.627 --> 00:05:05.491]  It was the people coming to demonstrate
[00:05:07.119 --> 00:05:18.074]  On Saturday, September 18th, she said like a week ago, are coming here to celebrate people that came on January 6th who were coming for murder.
[00:05:19.036 --> 00:05:22.340]  She said they were coming to kill and they're celebrating those that came to kill.
[00:05:23.342 --> 00:05:41.151]  And then you have hysterical, probably a thousand riot police, thousands of state police brought in, hundreds and hundreds of Capitol Police, hundreds and hundreds of police cars, and armored vehicles, and helicopters, and media, and feds dressed in plain clothes outnumbering.
[00:05:43.018 --> 00:05:46.522]  The peaceful people there with American flags who said, let's cheer for the police.
[00:05:47.043 --> 00:05:48.004]  Yeah, we love law enforcement.
[00:05:48.024 --> 00:05:51.047]  We're here peacefully calling for due process for those that have been held.
[00:05:51.328 --> 00:05:55.532]  Here's some of the names of people that didn't even attack an officer or break anything inside the Capitol.
[00:05:55.793 --> 00:05:57.535]  And they're still in jail and that's not right.
[00:05:57.875 --> 00:05:59.437]  And that endangers us all.
[00:05:59.857 --> 00:06:02.601]  We need to have a level playing field in our judicial system.
[00:06:03.643 --> 00:06:03.923]  I think so.
[00:06:24.929 --> 00:06:27.592]  We then walked around the Capitol and documented it.
[00:06:27.612 --> 00:06:33.297]  We were followed by up to nine police cars and motorcycles that would pull up and rev their engines while we were doing interviews.
[00:06:33.758 --> 00:06:35.860]  While we were just trying to document what had really happened.
[00:06:36.994 --> 00:06:45.261]  And we had officers come and surround a New York police officer who is here legally with his firearm, but wasn't on federal property.
[00:06:45.661 --> 00:06:47.102]  They tried to set him up.
[00:06:47.763 --> 00:06:53.887]  They came over and said I was a wreck, that I looked horrible, to try to get me to get mad at them.
[00:06:54.568 --> 00:06:56.349]  A few provocateurs came up and cussed at us.
[00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:05.837]  And it made me sad, because I'm not an enemy of the police, but I realized that the police officers that were doing that were trying to get me mad at them, trying to get me in an argument with them, so they could arrest me.
[00:07:06.557 --> 00:07:09.119]  And they know full well we tried to stop the events that day.
[00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:10.660]  They know full well that that hurt Trump.
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:17.724]  They know full well that Trump wanted to have a 10-day investigation period in the Senate, and we had the votes until people broke into the Capitol.
[00:07:19.005 --> 00:07:21.646]  And so Trump thought there'd be Secret Service and Capitol Police there.
[00:07:21.666 --> 00:07:28.411]  He called for an additional 10,000 National Guard a few weeks before, and the District of Columbia said, no, the image of troops is oppressive.
[00:07:29.271 --> 00:07:34.616]  But Trump wanted it for his own crowd and for Antifa who were pledging to come out and attack people.
[00:07:35.077 --> 00:07:35.537]  And they did.
[00:07:35.577 --> 00:07:37.799]  They dressed up as Trump supporters and helped break into the Capitol.
[00:07:37.839 --> 00:07:40.462]  And quite a few have been charged for doing that.
[00:07:40.502 --> 00:07:43.465]  But they did fool some Trump supporters out of a million to be part of it.
[00:07:43.805 --> 00:07:44.746]  Let's not deny that.
[00:07:44.786 --> 00:07:45.507]  Let's be honest.
[00:07:45.567 --> 00:07:46.468]  And what happened was wrong.
[00:07:47.949 --> 00:07:49.811]  Do they deserve to have due process denied?
[00:07:50.271 --> 00:07:51.953]  Do they deserve to have their freedoms taken?
[00:07:51.993 --> 00:07:52.453]  No, they don't.
[00:07:53.434 --> 00:08:05.486]  So some of the security guys that are great patriots, a lot of them former police officers or current police officers, all of them former veterans, highly decorated guys who just salt the earth people, they were with me on January 6th.
[00:08:06.744 --> 00:08:17.133]  They were with me on September 18th, and so we're going to have some excerpts of some of the things they talked about, some of their memories from January 6th, and what they thought of what happened today.
[00:08:17.173 --> 00:08:24.059]  Because it's shameful how these political commissars, that's what they call it in Russia, political police, acted towards us.
[00:08:24.359 --> 00:08:31.285]  And it was reminiscent of like bad guys in a western, you know how they start fights for no reason, or reminiscent of third world police forces.
[00:08:32.026 --> 00:08:34.608]  Because they think this is popular what they're doing.
[00:08:34.948 --> 00:08:42.013]  Just like they've almost beaten to death and almost killed six or seven people that are in the solitary confinement because they're white.
[00:08:42.613 --> 00:08:48.137]  And when they beat them and when they make them go blind and gouge their eyes out, this has come out in court.
[00:08:48.517 --> 00:08:50.199]  They tell them you deserve this, you're a Nazi.
[00:08:50.979 --> 00:08:56.221]  Because the black correctional officers really believe these are Nazis, which is absolutely asinine.
[00:08:56.241 --> 00:08:59.803]  I mean, if you wanted to criticize Trump, he was almost too pro-Israel.
[00:09:00.023 --> 00:09:04.165]  I'm not against Israel, by the way, but I am against them being first and we being second.
[00:09:04.205 --> 00:09:06.546]  I mean, Trump almost made Israel first.
[00:09:07.042 --> 00:09:08.103]  It's very pro-Israel.
[00:09:08.484 --> 00:09:12.628]  So the idea that he's a Nazi or I'm a Nazi is just absolutely ridiculous.
[00:09:13.088 --> 00:09:14.910]  I don't like the British involved in our politics.
[00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:16.472]  I don't like the Israelis.
[00:09:16.852 --> 00:09:18.414]  I certainly don't like the Chinese involved.
[00:09:19.195 --> 00:09:22.338]  It's up to the Chinese or the Israelis or the Canadians.
[00:09:22.758 --> 00:09:24.640]  You need to stay the hell out of our internal affairs.
[00:09:24.981 --> 00:09:26.883]  And the globalist, Klaus Schwab, sure as hell does.
[00:09:27.683 --> 00:09:28.744]  Here's some more of what happened.
[00:09:28.764 --> 00:09:33.205]  I'm going to let my great camera guy, who shot so many hours, step aside.
[00:09:33.225 --> 00:09:38.848]  What we're going to present here, because we put it all here to be three hours of it, but we're going to boil this down for you.
[00:09:38.868 --> 00:09:50.093]  And then I hope you'll share the truth of what happened on January 18th and ask yourself, why are they creating such a hysteria, such a fear, when Trump supporters or people that question an election, that's a very American thing to do, show up.
[00:09:50.933 --> 00:09:55.595]  And now they're expanding the Capitol Police across the nation to spy on Americans.
[00:09:56.416 --> 00:09:59.022]  This is very, very dangerous and very, very un-American.
[00:09:59.503 --> 00:10:03.512]  But the truth is America is waking up and coming together and a lot of really, really good things are happening as well.
[00:10:04.093 --> 00:10:05.837]  So let's go to some of those important excerpts.
[00:10:06.482 --> 00:10:12.024]  But here we are, now, and they've created a police state here in Washington, D.C.
[00:10:12.664 --> 00:10:14.424]  for one reason and one reason only.
[00:10:14.884 --> 00:10:27.328]  To demonize conservatives, to demonize patriotic Americans, and to put the fear of God into them, that if they dare speak up, if they dare stand up for their rights, they will be prosecuted.
[00:10:27.708 --> 00:10:30.289]  Just like those people still sitting in D.C.
[00:10:30.349 --> 00:10:33.850]  jails for simply being here on January 6th, 2021.
[00:10:35.478 --> 00:10:40.340]  Joey, we're right back where we were on January 6th when you said, hey, you got to get up there and try to stop this.
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:48.663]  And I climbed up on that stack of chairs and tried to bullhorn people not to go in because they didn't know that 30, 40 minutes before, a few hundred people had broken over.
[00:10:48.683 --> 00:10:49.284]  The police had gone in.
[00:10:49.304 --> 00:10:50.584]  They just saw the cops wave right in.
[00:10:50.624 --> 00:10:52.365]  I was saying, hey, don't go in there.
[00:10:52.425 --> 00:10:53.005]  Turn back.
[00:10:53.105 --> 00:10:54.666]  And we later went to the other side of the Capitol.
[00:10:55.868 --> 00:11:08.575]  Reminiscing on that day, give us any thoughts on how America's changed since then, in eight months, and then that point you were making about all the massive build-up of police and stuff, ready to be brought in, how there was a stand-down that day, plus the force we see here today.
[00:11:08.615 --> 00:11:10.516]  I mean, obviously we know there was a stand-down.
[00:11:10.536 --> 00:11:18.721]  Trump asked for 10,000 troops for his event, and those were denied to him by the District of Columbia here, so give us your thoughts.
[00:11:19.301 --> 00:11:28.667]  I mean, what's interesting to me is on January 6th, following what ensued, we sat right on that building across the street on the OAN rooftop and had a bird's eye view of everything unfolding.
[00:11:29.267 --> 00:11:35.011]  And we literally watched resources pour into this area and deploy force protection measures rapidly.
[00:11:35.051 --> 00:11:36.472]  They were pre-positioned somewhere.
[00:11:36.752 --> 00:11:38.934]  So my question is, where were they on January 5th?
[00:11:39.634 --> 00:11:41.095]  To help mitigate the situation.
[00:11:41.395 --> 00:11:49.439]  And now here we are on today, and because of the narrative, you know, they've got these same force protection measures for a few hundred people that in fact were peaceful.
[00:11:49.859 --> 00:11:56.022]  So I just find it odd that those resources were on standby, but weren't employed until after violent activities ensued.
[00:11:56.322 --> 00:11:59.083]  So in my opinion, that all could have been prevented, essentially.
[00:11:59.704 --> 00:12:02.125]  Well Joey, for me it shows how obvious it is that
[00:12:02.987 --> 00:12:07.111]  The Deep State was aware that they could provocateur a small number of people out of a million that were here in D.C.
[00:12:07.131 --> 00:12:09.913]  total, miles away down Pennsylvania at the Ellipse.
[00:12:10.874 --> 00:12:16.659]  And then they bragged in Time Magazine later how they helped provocateur it, and they've arrested Antifa that did help break in.
[00:12:16.739 --> 00:12:25.147]  So, they manipulated a small number of people in a crowd, had the police stand down, opened the gates, but then had the force ready to come in later to quote, save the day.
[00:12:25.167 --> 00:12:29.871]  And of course then the giant crowd dispersed because no one had told them to disperse until that point.
[00:12:30.171 --> 00:12:31.131]  Those are the people outside.
[00:12:31.251 --> 00:12:41.273]  Yeah, well, strategically, that degrades the outcome of what a million-plus red-blooded Americans, and primarily half that crowd was veterans, what that statement would have made during our peaceful demonstration.
[00:12:41.614 --> 00:12:44.414]  So, strategically, they placed those people to degrade that narrative.
[00:12:44.874 --> 00:12:53.356]  If you look at the advanced footage that we have from that day, those people were already engaged in violent activity with Capitol Police before Trump was even speaking.
[00:12:53.636 --> 00:12:56.037]  We were miles up Pennsylvania Avenue before that.
[00:12:56.317 --> 00:12:57.417]  You know, we weren't even involved.
[00:12:57.797 --> 00:13:00.878]  Second time today here in Washington, D.C., outside the U.S.
[00:13:00.918 --> 00:13:04.679]  Capitol, that we've been confronted by the Capitol Police.
[00:13:05.079 --> 00:13:06.880]  And again, I'd like to say this.
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:15.562]  There was one Capitol Police officer today who was very nice and professional and, you know, came over, shook hands, said, hey, how you doing?
[00:13:16.022 --> 00:13:22.364]  But the majority of the officers who have been sent to interdict us have been very, very unprofessional.
[00:13:22.784 --> 00:13:26.765]  And me, as a former law enforcement officer, I'm very disappointed in their conduct, okay?
[00:13:27.045 --> 00:13:35.231]  We just had officers stand right there at his patrol car with the door open, you know, making derogatory comments on physical appearance and things like that.
[00:13:35.832 --> 00:13:38.293]  Is that what your supervisor sent you over here for?
[00:13:38.634 --> 00:13:40.195]  Now he's taken off quickly, right?
[00:13:40.515 --> 00:13:45.119]  But my question to his supervisors inside that Capitol is, is that the way you're training your police force?
[00:13:45.399 --> 00:13:46.680]  To make personal insults?
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:52.664]  If you have a personal position about us being here in Washington, D.C., state that personal position, okay?
[00:13:52.724 --> 00:13:53.925]  As a professional law enforcement officer.
[00:13:53.945 --> 00:13:54.766]  He said I look like a wreck.
[00:13:54.966 --> 00:13:56.828]  Yeah, isn't this what I'm saying?
[00:13:57.789 --> 00:14:00.712]  You need to get out of here and I want to call it a day.
[00:14:00.732 --> 00:14:02.353]  I don't want to be here following you around.
[00:14:02.554 --> 00:14:03.935]  Well, why are you following us around?
[00:14:04.135 --> 00:14:06.357]  We're not doing anything illegal here in Washington, D.C.
[00:14:06.538 --> 00:14:09.861]  We have a right as American citizens to be here, but I'll tell you why.
[00:14:10.161 --> 00:14:12.764]  Because they have now turned Washington, D.C.
[00:14:13.064 --> 00:14:14.626]  into a quasi-police state.
[00:14:15.106 --> 00:14:21.351]  That's right, we came here to show people what they're turning into and now they're setting up Capitol Police officers around the nation.
[00:14:21.371 --> 00:14:22.672]  Are they going to follow me around in Austin?
[00:14:22.912 --> 00:14:24.974]  Three more officers over here watching us, right?
[00:14:25.054 --> 00:14:25.794]  It's non-stop.
[00:14:25.894 --> 00:14:33.460]  Literally, on two separate occasions today, the police, the Capitol Police specifically, I want to make sure that we identify who these officers belong to.
[00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:34.821]  The Capitol, the U.S.
[00:14:34.861 --> 00:14:43.568]  Capitol Police have baited us and baited our personnel with personal attacks and insinuations about that we're somehow doing wrongful conduct
[00:14:43.948 --> 00:14:48.490]  In an order to get a response from us that they can then react to and make an arrest to.
[00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:51.431]  And that is shameful conduct for police officers.
[00:14:51.671 --> 00:14:53.531]  As I said, I wore the badge for 11 years.
[00:14:53.932 --> 00:14:55.852]  I support law enforcement 100%.
[00:14:56.132 --> 00:14:59.093]  I would die to protect the law enforcement officer if his life was in danger.
[00:14:59.494 --> 00:15:07.916]  But, these Capitol Police officers that came after us today, continuously interdicting us, following us, they are shameful in their actions.
[00:15:08.217 --> 00:15:11.418]  And they're lackeys of their big bosses right inside that U.S.
[00:15:11.458 --> 00:15:11.798]  Capitol.
[00:15:12.398 --> 00:15:24.354]  It's critical to understand that the Democrats bragged in a major Time Magazine article that came out a few months after January 6th, that they had helped provocateur groups and destabilize this whole situation.
[00:15:24.414 --> 00:15:26.317]  Out of a million people that showed up to hear Trump speak.
[00:15:27.116 --> 00:15:31.081]  Again, they only tricked 600 or so to go into the building and only a handful of those were violent.
[00:15:31.541 --> 00:15:39.631]  On the back of this, Biden has now issued a new national security strategy saying the main threat is the American people.
[00:15:39.671 --> 00:15:43.296]  He wants the CIA to build dossiers and target people.
[00:15:43.336 --> 00:15:44.237]  That's all illegal.
[00:15:44.557 --> 00:15:45.559]  That's the big threat.
[00:15:45.939 --> 00:15:47.480]  Well, that's an unconstitutional stipulation.
[00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:48.900]  But the FBI went to one man's house
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:26.923]  Just three weeks ago, for a, quote, compliance visit, and checked his computers and found out he was watching Mike Lindell's cyber security election three day symposium.
[00:16:27.183 --> 00:16:31.204]  And when he confessed to it, he was taken back to jail and put in solitary confinement.
[00:16:31.384 --> 00:16:41.607]  So for the crime of looking at legal information on the internet about an election, he was taken back into federal custody and thrown into solitary confinement awaiting trial.
[00:16:42.347 --> 00:16:53.050]  And the press, the supposed guardians of free speech on CNN and The Hill and everywhere else, came out and cheered it and said, Mike Lindell got this man in trouble by doing his symposium.
[00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:59.452]  That put the man in jail, as if watching a symposium about election fraud sends you to jail.
[00:16:59.752 --> 00:17:01.112]  So that's who's running this country.
[00:17:01.132 --> 00:17:09.335]  They want to put forced inoculations in you, they want to surveil you, they want to spy on you, they want to censor you, and they want to put your ass under the jail.
[00:17:09.855 --> 00:17:11.596]  This is what authoritarianism looks like.
[00:17:11.996 --> 00:17:17.660]  Even in Red Square, Russia, at the height of the Cold War, as I said earlier, they didn't have fences like this around their buildings.
[00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:23.904]  If you go to Tiananmen Square, at the heart of the communist Chinese dictatorship, it doesn't have fences like this.
[00:17:24.624 --> 00:17:31.769]  This is done to condition Americans to the idea of living in a hardened, checkpoint, police state society.
[00:17:32.029 --> 00:17:32.389]  Period.
[00:17:32.609 --> 00:17:35.431]  And it's extremely dangerous, and it's only accelerating.
[00:17:35.711 --> 00:17:38.273]  So on a scale of 1 to 10 of tyranny, we're already at an 8.
[00:17:38.993 --> 00:17:43.434]  And now they're saying they want a civil war with American gun owners while they implode our borders.
[00:17:44.034 --> 00:17:48.356]  This is a globalist consortium working with Communist China, openly trying to bring down our nation.
[00:17:48.616 --> 00:17:50.336]  I've been saying that for at least 10 years.
[00:17:50.656 --> 00:18:03.140]  But now, even the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Milley, says he's proud of the fact that he legally called the head of the Chinese military to say that Trump tried to overthrow the government on January 6th, and that they'd taken the nukes away from him, so don't worry.
[00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:05.062]  That is so illegal.
[00:18:05.123 --> 00:18:05.944]  That is treason.
[00:18:05.984 --> 00:18:16.143]  That is collusion with a foreign power and the Washington establishment has been defending him because they are special interests that have hijacked this nation and that have stolen this country and now put a puppet
[00:18:17.062 --> 00:18:18.463]  The left pledges allegiance to Xi Jinping.
[00:18:41.517 --> 00:18:45.900]  Mark Zuckerberg tried to name his first child after Xi Jinping and he didn't give him permission.
[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:50.904]  Trudeau says he wants to have a dictatorship like Xi Jinping over Canada and is establishing one.
[00:18:51.184 --> 00:18:52.365]  This is all happening.
[00:18:52.585 --> 00:18:55.987]  This is an authoritarian move happening because the system thinks we're weak.
[00:18:56.247 --> 00:18:57.088]  They think we're asleep.
[00:18:57.328 --> 00:18:59.850]  It's time to wake up out of the trance.
[00:19:05.299 --> 00:19:05.619]  I don't
