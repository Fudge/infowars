[00:00:15.456 --> 00:00:19.660]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:20.421 --> 00:00:23.084]  And it is Saturday, June 26.

[00:00:46.498 --> 00:00:52.880]  We're going to be airing that, but this is a special Saturday transmission coming up today.
[00:00:53.661 --> 00:00:54.501]  We're going to lay out.
[00:00:56.124 --> 00:01:04.086]  The attempts at false flags, the attempts at race war, the attempts to bring in this world government, it's all coming up on this Saturday.
[00:01:04.106 --> 00:01:11.268]  And then after the show goes out, we will re-air it over and over again at InfoWars.com and Bandai Video.
[00:01:11.308 --> 00:01:16.109]  As long as you continue to support us, we'll be on air, but we're only here thanks to your sufferance.
[00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:17.329]  Thanks for your support.

[00:02:27.262 --> 00:02:30.264]  In this crazy world, everyone needs to be prepared.
[00:02:30.704 --> 00:02:31.965]  Everyone needs storable food.
[00:02:33.206 --> 00:02:34.686]  So I went out 12 years ago.
[00:02:36.227 --> 00:02:39.649]  They got the highest rated storable food company out there as our sponsor.
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.202]  They were not big 12 years ago, but they had high ratings.
[00:02:43.662 --> 00:02:46.224]  They're 14 years old, or it's 15 now.
[00:02:46.584 --> 00:02:47.164]  Time flies.
[00:02:47.725 --> 00:02:51.848]  My Patriot, biggest storable food company in the world, our big sponsor.
[00:02:52.208 --> 00:02:54.709]  We have their full catalog at infowarestore.com.
[00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.934]  And when you order now, you get an additional 10% off the lowest price you're going to find anywhere.
[00:03:01.254 --> 00:03:02.595]  They were going to have to raise prices.
[00:03:02.615 --> 00:03:03.495]  They already did the new year.
[00:03:03.896 --> 00:03:05.617]  Everybody else is raising them because of inflation.
[00:03:06.077 --> 00:03:08.799]  They're not doing it until the year 2022.
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.702]  Which is hard to believe only six months out, they will go up in price.
[00:03:13.722 --> 00:03:23.508]  But right now, lock in prices, beat inflation, and support the M4 while you get prepared at the same time at infowarrestore.com.

[00:03:59.758 --> 00:04:04.180]  All right, so that said, appreciate the crew being up here and getting this out.
[00:04:05.381 --> 00:04:17.506]  I want to go ahead and go to an interview I taped yesterday on Friday with Ted Nugent and his wife about solutions, about positivity, and about so much more.
[00:04:18.267 --> 00:04:26.731]  And then we'll talk to the rest of the big guests like Max Keiser on Bitcoin, inflation, and so much more tonight.
[00:04:27.311 --> 00:04:28.892]  But whatever you do, realize this is not
[00:04:30.089 --> 00:04:32.973]  A spectator sport, this is a participation sport.
[00:04:33.414 --> 00:04:40.745]  So please, take the live feed of the show, take the archive of the show, and share it, because that's coffin nails to the New World Order.
[00:04:41.146 --> 00:04:42.368]  Here he is, Ted Nugent.
[00:04:43.311 --> 00:04:54.286]  And so here we are on this Saturday transmission with Shemaine Nugent and Ted Nugent from their bunker, they tell me, out in the beautiful woods of Michigan where they're recording a new hit album.
[00:04:54.807 --> 00:04:58.431]  So much happening here in the country, the best of times, the worst of times it seems.
[00:04:59.112 --> 00:05:00.895]  Ted, Shemaine, where do you guys want to start?
[00:05:02.369 --> 00:05:04.651]  Well, I think the best of times, the worst of times.
[00:05:04.711 --> 00:05:18.025]  First of all, every time we get together, Alex, we have a new toxic level of evil and power abuse and criminal misuse of authority by government, media, academia, the punks in Hollywood.
[00:05:18.285 --> 00:05:20.067]  But let's start on a positive note.
[00:05:20.427 --> 00:05:33.011]  That I have Mrs. Nugent at my side, and we got Coco, Happy, and Sadie on the floor of our Sonic Bombast Barn Recording Studio, Man Cave, Cuckoo's Nest, Ammo Dump, Arsenal, Taxidermy Celebration.
[00:05:33.831 --> 00:05:36.432]  Everybody I know, Alex, and I think everybody you know,
[00:05:37.142 --> 00:05:40.643]  We carve out a positive American dream every day.
[00:05:40.703 --> 00:05:42.744]  Everybody I know is in the asset column.
[00:05:42.784 --> 00:05:44.004]  We continue to work hard.
[00:05:44.264 --> 00:05:54.507]  Here in the state of Michigan, the government could not misrepresent us more horribly than they do here in the state of Michigan, like so many states.
[00:05:54.847 --> 00:06:03.130]  But that positive energy, that positive spirit, making the greatest music of my life with Jason and Greg and Mike and Andy and Tim.
[00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.631]  What a positive celebration.
[00:06:05.671 --> 00:06:12.794]  The wildlife is thriving in the swamps of Michigan, but we still combat the evil that is ubiquitous.
[00:06:12.894 --> 00:06:16.275]  It's literally metastasizing at an evil pace.
[00:06:16.315 --> 00:06:18.056]  So a big salute to you, Alex.
[00:06:18.476 --> 00:06:21.678]  For spotlighting these cockroaches and sounding the alarm.
[00:06:22.078 --> 00:06:26.740]  Everybody I know is starting to wake up going, you know, Alex Jones has been right.
[00:06:27.121 --> 00:06:32.063]  Even some of the pundits on some of the major, like my friend Tucker Carlson.
[00:06:32.343 --> 00:06:39.347]  He's given you a nod recently going, you know, you can laugh at Alex Jones, but you're denying the facts and the evidence.
[00:06:39.367 --> 00:06:40.608]  So a big salute to you.
[00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:50.098]  You know, I, I'm going to say something that I think you might be surprised and Ted might be surprised because I heard your podcast yesterday and it was kind of dark.
[00:06:50.898 --> 00:06:55.783]  And I want to say that this, honestly, I am excited to be alive right now.
[00:06:56.003 --> 00:07:04.652]  This is an incredible time for us to be here on this planet for us, for you and Ted really to be the voices.
[00:07:05.177 --> 00:07:06.398]  And Tucker, a few others.
[00:07:06.738 --> 00:07:14.183]  But you know, in the Bible, we are reminded that not everyone who has eyes can see, not everyone who has ears can hear.
[00:07:14.803 --> 00:07:21.387]  And what you and Ted have always talked about, people are now waking up.
[00:07:21.868 --> 00:07:23.869]  I feel like this is kind of an exciting time.
[00:07:24.773 --> 00:07:27.435]  Shemaine, I want you to elaborate on that, because some days I'm really upbeat.
[00:07:27.495 --> 00:07:30.497]  Yesterday, I mean, the broadcast was fake.
[00:07:30.577 --> 00:07:41.163]  I was kind of down, just really pissed, reading all the evil, horrible things that even the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs was saying about America, and just seeing the Black Lives Matter and Antifa garbage.
[00:07:41.664 --> 00:07:43.545]  Sometimes it gets me down, but you're absolutely right.
[00:07:44.005 --> 00:07:48.588]  We should be positive, because the awakening is so huge that it's happening right now.
[00:07:48.628 --> 00:07:51.410]  Let me ask you that question, though, to both of you, but first, Shemaine.
[00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:57.457]  Why does the left want to attack the refuges that we all try to create to make America good?
[00:07:57.838 --> 00:07:58.879]  Why do they want to dominate?
[00:07:58.959 --> 00:08:01.423]  Why do they destroy every city they're in control of?
[00:08:01.523 --> 00:08:05.849]  Why do they seek out the youth of this country, little children, to try to corrupt them?
[00:08:06.209 --> 00:08:07.271]  What is their problem?
[00:08:08.442 --> 00:08:11.903]  Well, you know, and you've always talked about it, Alex, it's indoctrination.
[00:08:12.343 --> 00:08:21.466]  And it's a way of them to pull the cover over our eyes, our children's eyes, and to get them to see things that aren't really true.
[00:08:22.046 --> 00:08:25.427]  And to get them indoctrinated into what they want to believe.
[00:08:25.467 --> 00:08:25.887]  And it's like,
[00:08:26.347 --> 00:08:26.547]  Yes.
[00:08:26.647 --> 00:08:26.727]  Yes.
[00:08:47.426 --> 00:08:48.307]  World domination.
[00:08:48.827 --> 00:08:51.810]  Yeah, and Alex, let me do an Uncle Ted Tech Tip.
[00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:59.156]  We've had 30-some years of the Ted Nugent's Spirit of the Wild Show on Outdoor Channel where we celebrate nature and hands-on conservation.
[00:08:59.476 --> 00:09:02.959]  Aim small, miss small, marksmanship, and the mystical flight of the aerosol.
[00:09:03.019 --> 00:09:04.360]  Positive, positive, positive.
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:09.384]  But I know you respect your elders, and I'm going to give you the ultimate Uncle Ted Tech Tip.
[00:09:09.985 --> 00:09:13.628]  When some devil rapes an innocent person,
[00:09:14.611 --> 00:09:16.372]  I don't need to know their motive.
[00:09:16.652 --> 00:09:18.694]  You don't need to investigate their motive.
[00:09:18.954 --> 00:09:24.477]  You don't need to stress out trying to figure out why would the devil perform evil acts.
[00:09:24.918 --> 00:09:27.459]  Because they're evil.
[00:09:27.799 --> 00:09:29.400]  They already have the power.
[00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:31.021]  They already have all the money.
[00:09:31.261 --> 00:09:32.782]  They already have control.
[00:09:33.003 --> 00:09:36.585]  So it can't be those evil pursuits because they've already got it.
[00:09:37.025 --> 00:09:38.366]  They're just
[00:09:39.026 --> 00:09:45.048]  Rotten to the core and they are filled with hate and control over innocence.
[00:09:45.108 --> 00:09:48.549]  So the bottom line is ignore the seeking of a motive.
[00:09:48.949 --> 00:10:04.414]  Let's just crush them and that's going to take we the people becoming more and more active kind of like that radical guitar player who has always raised hell because I have a moral spiritual and intellectual obligation to participate in
[00:10:04.734 --> 00:10:07.057]  In this sacred experiment in self-government.
[00:10:07.257 --> 00:10:15.528]  So the battle cry is crush them, hopefully at a voting booth that is actually legal and accurate.
[00:10:15.548 --> 00:10:16.970]  But we're working on these things.
[00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:20.895]  I think what Shemain says and what you say, this is the Great Awakening.
[00:10:21.175 --> 00:10:26.999]  This is where the middle ground fence-sitters are going, my God, have you seen the price of beef?
[00:10:27.219 --> 00:10:29.040]  Have you seen the price of gas?
[00:10:29.401 --> 00:10:34.144]  Kamala Harris says she hasn't been to Europe when she's asked a question about the border.
[00:10:34.424 --> 00:10:38.787]  They're just evil punks and they must be stopped.
[00:10:39.387 --> 00:10:43.652]  It does seem like a switch has been thrown and they are really taking the mask off.
[00:10:43.672 --> 00:10:47.856]  A few days ago, Biden whispering, going, I sent him the checks in the mail.
[00:10:48.416 --> 00:10:48.977]  I did it.
[00:10:49.017 --> 00:10:51.820]  He sounds like a deranged lunatic, which he is.
[00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:53.882]  And as you said, Kamala thinks that the U.S.
[00:10:54.302 --> 00:10:55.323]  border is Europe.
[00:10:55.724 --> 00:10:57.706]  What the hell planet are these people on?
[00:10:59.537 --> 00:11:00.899]  I've never seen anything like it.
[00:11:01.259 --> 00:11:13.753]  You know, I watched the beatniks turn into the hippies and pursue this disaster known as Comfortably Numb, which now we are experiencing the manifestation of that cultural deprivation, that cultural abandonment.
[00:11:13.993 --> 00:11:14.914]  But I got to tell you,
[00:11:15.851 --> 00:11:36.796]  If you hung out with my great band and my crew and my team and my sons and all our hunting guides at Sunrise Acres, and if you went to the grill with me, if you went to Prime Cuts to get some thick-cut bacon with me, Alex, I'm telling you, working hard, playing hard American, they're not just talking about the source of their beautiful organic pork, they're going,
[00:11:37.156 --> 00:11:39.457]  You know, Ted, we got to stop this Gretchen Whitmer.
[00:11:39.757 --> 00:11:41.358]  She really is evil.
[00:11:41.618 --> 00:12:01.867]  These are just mom and pop people who haven't been engaged until recently, and they are speaking like Ted Nugent and Alex Jones because they care, because they're concerned, and they see the horror outcome of these liberals and these Democrats and these Marxists and these terrorists and the terrorists.
[00:12:02.047 --> 00:12:03.127]  How about this, Alex? 2021.
[00:12:05.089 --> 00:12:19.239]  Terrorists like Black Lives Matter, we've seen the footage of their terror, Antifa, which are actually the fascists, and how about the FBI, are now part of that gang.
[00:12:19.759 --> 00:12:27.965]  This is a terrible time, but now the spotlight is wider and brighter, and the cockroaches are scrambling, so now's the time to stomp them.
[00:12:28.406 --> 00:12:33.389]  That's what was so shocking earlier in the week, to see the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
[00:12:35.766 --> 00:12:42.629]  I mean, for those that don't know, I'm sure most viewers do know, he came out and said he wants to know about white rage and that white rage caused the Capitol.
[00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:46.411]  That's a Southern Poverty Law Center line that comes out of the Democrats.
[00:12:46.471 --> 00:12:49.953]  I want to understand white rage, and I'm white, and I want to understand it.
[00:12:50.413 --> 00:12:58.738]  So, what is it that caused thousands of people to assault this building and try to overturn the Constitution of the United States of America?
[00:12:58.778 --> 00:12:59.418]  What caused that?
[00:13:00.031 --> 00:13:00.812]  I want to find that out.
[00:13:23.007 --> 00:13:31.855]  And so now critical race theory, a Marxist-Leninist ideology to split up our military and break our country is being taught and promoted by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
[00:13:32.195 --> 00:13:35.739]  I mean, this is disgusting, but like you said now, it's out in the open.
[00:13:35.999 --> 00:13:45.307]  And we have Biden last Monday issuing a new policy paper saying white supremism is the number one threat to America, something that's almost non-existent.
[00:13:45.668 --> 00:13:48.330]  I mean, I know this is something you guys have really been researching.
[00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:49.231]  What's going on?
[00:13:49.858 --> 00:13:55.860]  It's overwhelmingly obvious to so many of us, but we are waking people up.
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:14:00.781]  And if 2020 showed us anything, it's that everything can change in a blink of an eye.
[00:14:01.162 --> 00:14:15.466]  And if we don't wake up even more, if we are not involved in local politics and local school board elections, and when we see something truly say something, and it's so heartwarming to me to see these
[00:14:16.041 --> 00:14:16.461]  Thank you.
[00:14:32.908 --> 00:14:40.073]  When the Joint Chiefs of Staff reference a color to rage, that's the definition of racism.
[00:14:40.393 --> 00:14:41.413]  You've got to be kidding me.
[00:14:41.473 --> 00:14:43.595]  I've got children and grandchildren.
[00:14:43.615 --> 00:14:49.558]  We've got neighbors in rural Texas and rural Michigan and downtown Detroit and pretty much everywhere around the country.
[00:14:50.159 --> 00:14:58.564]  Guess what none of my children, none of my grandchildren, none of my friends, none of my neighbors have ever referenced, Alex?
[00:14:59.625 --> 00:15:00.085]  Color!
[00:15:00.934 --> 00:15:03.895]  Nobody's ever cared about color!
[00:15:04.035 --> 00:15:10.196]  All we want to know is content of character, and did you show up on time and do the job to the best of your ability?
[00:15:10.476 --> 00:15:16.997]  I gotta tell you, I'm 72 and a half years old, and being clean and sober, my radar picks up accurate information.
[00:15:17.538 --> 00:15:24.359]  And I gotta tell you, when I see this government and this media constantly referencing color
[00:15:24.961 --> 00:15:26.022]  It's toxic.
[00:15:26.543 --> 00:15:29.385]  It's counter to the America I've grown up in.
[00:15:29.445 --> 00:15:30.306]  Remember, I was born in 1948.
[00:15:30.906 --> 00:15:34.570]  I saw the white drinking fountain and the black drinking fountain.
[00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:37.292]  We fixed that.
[00:15:37.952 --> 00:15:43.097]  A million and a half Americans fought and died to end slavery.
[00:15:43.557 --> 00:15:45.339]  We fixed that.
[00:15:45.739 --> 00:15:48.702]  Now, since Obama, and now with this freak,
[00:15:49.358 --> 00:15:57.943]  This zombie Biden, they're literally fanning the flames of an almost invisible, completely burnt out ember of racism.
[00:15:58.263 --> 00:16:02.966]  It was inconsequential till Obama started fanning those flames.
[00:16:03.607 --> 00:16:09.730]  I'm heartbroken by this because I got friends of every race, every creed, every color, every gender confusion.
[00:16:09.971 --> 00:16:17.175]  I got friends in every category of humankind and we're all tilting our head and squinting our eyes and furrowing our brows going,
[00:16:18.354 --> 00:16:20.117]  Since when is this important?
[00:16:20.537 --> 00:16:21.879]  It's never been important.
[00:16:22.179 --> 00:16:32.314]  They're dividing us and the sheep wearing the masks by themselves in the park are the sheep that are falling for this scam and we're trying to wake them up.
[00:16:33.092 --> 00:16:33.793]  I totally agree.
[00:16:34.234 --> 00:16:38.639]  I mean, you talk about being positive and I should be more positive, but I just see all the evil.
[00:16:38.799 --> 00:16:41.263]  I get bummed out sometimes, but you're absolutely right.
[00:16:42.023 --> 00:16:44.767]  As bad as this is, it's causing the biggest awakening I've ever seen.
[00:16:44.807 --> 00:16:48.432]  I've been interviewing your great husband for at least 20 years and I'm able to talk to you for
[00:16:48.812 --> 00:16:53.935]  Four, five, six, and I've never seen you guys so positive, and I think you're right.
[00:16:53.975 --> 00:16:54.635]  I know you're right.
[00:16:54.996 --> 00:16:59.918]  Some really good things are happening, but the system is trying to counter-strike, trying to divide us.
[00:16:59.998 --> 00:17:02.080]  As Ted just said, how do we counter that?
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:13.566]  When you see the school board in Virginia, where they only let the leftists speak for like 30 minutes to trigger the crowd, and the crowd yells, so the police declare unlawful assembly and start beating people up.
[00:17:13.666 --> 00:17:14.747]  I'm not against the police.
[00:17:15.287 --> 00:17:22.653]  I think the police overall are good, but in leftist cities where the police are controlled by the libs, they become tyrannical enforcers of the left.
[00:17:22.933 --> 00:17:28.617]  So I'm really concerned about what we've been seeing around the country where peaceful people try to get up and speak and are being stopped.
[00:17:29.718 --> 00:17:44.490]  Well, first of all, to talk about the positivity, Ted knows I've had many, many sleepless nights and I do a little bit too much research, but I think that's what's really most important is that we all do our own research and these people who are speaking out
[00:17:44.986 --> 00:17:46.286]  And they are being suppressed.
[00:17:46.666 --> 00:17:48.167]  They need to continue to speak out.
[00:17:48.667 --> 00:17:53.528]  They will have their voices heard, but we cannot stop, Alex.
[00:17:53.908 --> 00:17:57.889]  We have to encourage people on a local level to get involved.
[00:17:57.929 --> 00:18:12.192]  This is where it starts, and this is how we awaken so many people, because there is a war of good and evil right now, and there's a demonic presence, and there's spiritual warfare going on, and a lot of people can't see that.
[00:18:12.799 --> 00:18:19.585]  But many of us can and what you and Ted are doing right now and so many other digital soldiers out there.
[00:18:20.446 --> 00:18:24.790]  We are waking people up and I think that's what's really most important to find the thing.
[00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:32.257]  This is what I try to do every day is find the thing that makes your heart sing and do it whether it's going for a walk with your dogs or
[00:18:33.044 --> 00:18:33.985]  Shootin' a bow and arrow!
[00:18:34.025 --> 00:18:35.806]  Shootin' a bow and arrow or play an instrument.
[00:18:35.846 --> 00:18:39.047]  For me, I like to work out and crank up the music that Ted hates.
[00:18:39.167 --> 00:18:39.948]  Sorry, honey.
[00:18:40.388 --> 00:18:43.210]  I love watching you dance to it, I can tell you that.
[00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:45.371]  But you've got to do that.
[00:18:45.431 --> 00:18:48.553]  You've got to get back to the basics and fill your heart.
[00:18:48.573 --> 00:18:51.054]  You know, God gave each and every one of us a gift.
[00:18:51.534 --> 00:18:58.297]  You have the gift of prophecy, and you need to share that, continue to share that, and there are so many others that we need.
[00:18:58.337 --> 00:19:01.998]  It might not be, you know, on a level of what you and Ted have.
[00:19:02.539 --> 00:19:13.303]  We might not all need to do that, but we can help people, we can assist people, we can pray for people, and I think that is the most important thing right now, is that we open our Bibles,
[00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:14.610]  And we pray.
[00:19:15.131 --> 00:19:16.772]  And Alex, let me emphasize that.
[00:19:16.792 --> 00:19:20.174]  You know, a lot of people go, I'm glad you have a format where you can get your voice out there, Ted.
[00:19:20.414 --> 00:19:22.255]  And I go, when was the last time you called your mayor?
[00:19:22.735 --> 00:19:29.059]  When was the last time you told your governor you believe in law and order and defunding the police is cultural suicide?
[00:19:29.099 --> 00:19:29.939]  When did you tell him that?
[00:19:30.199 --> 00:19:31.260]  Well, they'll never listen to me.
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:32.781]  You didn't call.
[00:19:33.281 --> 00:19:35.943]  Alex, I want to tell your listeners and your viewers right now.
[00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:43.512]  Each of your individual voice might be more powerful than Alex Jones and Ted Nugent.
[00:19:43.792 --> 00:19:56.856]  Because if your governor and your mayor and your senator and your congressman get calls from concerned, passionate, sincere, believable families going, I don't know why the government claims white supremacy is a problem.
[00:19:57.377 --> 00:19:58.877]  I've never seen it.
[00:19:59.497 --> 00:20:05.039]  I know that all the people killed in Chicago this last weekend, like every day, every weekend,
[00:20:05.799 --> 00:20:08.182]  There was no white supremacy involved.
[00:20:08.522 --> 00:20:09.724]  Why do you keep lying?
[00:20:09.784 --> 00:20:19.536]  Don't let this lie be policy fodder in my state where you work for me, Mr. Weyer, where you work for me, Mr. Governor, where you work for me, Senator and Congressman.
[00:20:19.995 --> 00:20:23.338]  Everybody, your voice is gold.
[00:20:23.918 --> 00:20:30.843]  Call your elected employees and tell them you know that critical race theory is racism.
[00:20:31.224 --> 00:20:38.729]  Tell them you know that if you have general neutrality, that you're being dishonest and you're teaching your children hate.
[00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:40.771]  Call them and tell them that.
[00:20:41.271 --> 00:20:43.153]  Alex, I've said it since the time we met.
[00:20:43.857 --> 00:20:55.709]  Worse than Marxism, worse than racism, worse than demonicy, is the apathy that rolls out the red carpet and lets that evil continue to perpetuate.
[00:20:55.949 --> 00:21:00.013]  So, don't be an apathetic non-player.
[00:21:00.073 --> 00:21:05.358]  Be an American Hellraiser and call those elected employees and tell them the basics.
[00:21:05.598 --> 00:21:06.619]  Call them once a week.
[00:21:06.699 --> 00:21:08.321]  I'd rather see them call them once a day.
[00:21:08.661 --> 00:21:10.602]  Well, can I insert one thing?
[00:21:11.763 --> 00:21:23.730]  Actually, several things, but the first thing is, you know, Alex, when we had the honor, the privilege to go visit President Trump at the White House in 2017, it was the first time that I had major death threats.
[00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:30.213]  Sarah Palin and I were taking selfies in the Oval Office and it was just an amazing time.
[00:21:30.333 --> 00:21:36.817]  I posted some photos on my social media and I had so much hate and so many death threats.
[00:21:37.233 --> 00:21:44.637]  I cried for a couple of days, but I put on my big girl pants and I started delete, delete, delete, delete, blocking people.
[00:21:45.017 --> 00:21:46.638]  And I realized that, you know what?
[00:21:47.118 --> 00:21:49.680]  And this is something that I've seen Ted go through.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:22:00.466]  The haters actually inspire him, but it's difficult for a lot of people like me who, you know, we care about what people say, but we cannot anymore.
[00:22:00.946 --> 00:22:06.009]  We have to be aligned with God and with biblical principles, I believe,
[00:22:06.471 --> 00:22:10.293]  And then, you know, if God is for us, who can be against us?
[00:22:11.233 --> 00:22:12.174]  I totally agree with you.
[00:22:12.214 --> 00:22:16.015]  In fact, that was my next question was about President Trump, but we know is the president we know did win.
[00:22:16.616 --> 00:22:19.557]  The evidence is overwhelming, not just in Michigan, but all over the country.
[00:22:19.577 --> 00:22:24.219]  He won by record numbers compared to what he won four years ago, four and a half years ago.
[00:22:24.559 --> 00:22:27.781]  And the idea that we're not supposed to question it, they're now calling that terrorism.
[00:22:28.221 --> 00:22:34.664]  In the new report put out last Monday by Biden, it says officially what they've been saying on the news, that if you question the election,
[00:22:35.464 --> 00:22:36.325]  You're a white supremacist.
[00:22:36.666 --> 00:22:39.289]  That if you don't like open borders, you're a white supremacist.
[00:22:39.309 --> 00:22:41.512]  If you don't want to turn your guns in, you're a white supremacist.
[00:22:41.532 --> 00:22:42.613]  So that's the new definition.
[00:22:42.633 --> 00:22:43.875]  And if you're a white supremacist...
[00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:45.080]  You're
[00:23:06.895 --> 00:23:24.751]  Very soon, before these rallies start, because the evidence of election fraud is being documented, and so I think we should all really keep our eyes open and our ears, you know, up and listening, because right now the left is losing, but they've set the table to claim that whites are about to massacre a bunch of black people.
[00:23:25.111 --> 00:23:31.795]  So even when that happens, I'm saying, and General Flynn's saying, it has all the earmarks of a false flag, because where's the white supremacism?
[00:23:31.815 --> 00:23:32.755]  Basically doesn't exist.
[00:23:33.215 --> 00:23:34.936]  The black-on-black crime, a terrible thing.
[00:23:35.016 --> 00:23:36.057]  Trump trying to fix that.
[00:23:36.277 --> 00:23:37.438]  It actually went down under Trump.
[00:23:37.758 --> 00:23:38.578]  Now it's exploded.
[00:23:39.098 --> 00:23:53.346]  And so just your concerns, though, as positive as some things are about the sucker punches and what General Flynn and others and myself really see, because I mean, the next card to play would be to stage an event or wind up some crazy.
[00:23:54.602 --> 00:23:55.343]  Well, may I?
[00:23:55.703 --> 00:23:59.185]  You know, a lot of people are really heartbroken before they're angry.
[00:23:59.666 --> 00:24:01.907]  They're very frustrated before they're angry.
[00:24:02.588 --> 00:24:10.353]  Sure, there's a lot of anger out there because we see the abuse of power and the criminal explosion in our own government and the media.
[00:24:10.614 --> 00:24:14.176]  But let me just give you a website, HunterNation.org.
[00:24:14.476 --> 00:24:16.037]  It might sound like it's about hunting.
[00:24:16.398 --> 00:24:20.721]  It's about American families who want policy directed and guided
[00:24:21.221 --> 00:24:29.187]  By God, family, country, Constitution, Bill of Rights, the man in the arena, work ethic, law and order.
[00:24:29.568 --> 00:24:32.670]  Everybody go to HunterNation.org.
[00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:43.759]  We have galvanized a new voting army, and I can show you the numbers, we've talked about this before, but HunterNation.org is a galvanizing center
[00:24:44.389 --> 00:24:59.638]  For families who see the country going against God, against family, against country, against law and order, and I really believe that even though it focuses on the licensed hunters and fishermen and trappers, the real conservationists, the ranchers, the farmers, the outdoorsmen,
[00:25:00.178 --> 00:25:18.271]  That is an army of tens of millions of God family country voters and also learning to call their elected employees and hammering home those traditional family values that make America the destination for people who want an increased quality of life.
[00:25:18.611 --> 00:25:22.254]  Nobody's swimming to Venezuela this week to become free!
[00:25:22.634 --> 00:25:25.816]  So we need to raise more hell and HunterNation.org
[00:25:26.977 --> 00:25:34.783]  Is like the epicenter of people organizing and going to school board meetings going, why are you teaching my children racism?
[00:25:35.003 --> 00:25:37.105]  Why can't I call her, her?
[00:25:38.026 --> 00:25:44.991]  So it sounds simple, and it really is simple, but people need to become activated and go to that website.
[00:25:45.171 --> 00:25:46.612]  It's not just for hunters.
[00:25:46.632 --> 00:25:48.594]  It's for people who want to get involved.
[00:25:48.954 --> 00:25:52.197]  And what we're doing there, what we're about to do on Hunter Nation also,
[00:25:52.837 --> 00:26:00.559]  Is to help people who haven't ever hunted learn how to get involved in this hunting lifestyle that we have.
[00:26:00.599 --> 00:26:04.200]  Because there's one thing that we did not worry about last year, Alex.
[00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:07.241]  We never worried about during the lockdown.
[00:26:07.261 --> 00:26:12.162]  And if you've seen that movie Songbird, have you seen that by the way?
[00:26:12.702 --> 00:26:16.043]  No, I haven't, but I'm told it basically predicts what's coming.
[00:26:17.375 --> 00:26:18.936]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:26:19.396 --> 00:26:22.958]  Hunters, we're not going to worry about where our source of food comes from.
[00:26:22.978 --> 00:26:26.140]  And guess what price increase doesn't bother the Nugent family?
[00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:27.941]  Venison!
[00:26:28.061 --> 00:26:28.461]  Beef!
[00:26:28.781 --> 00:26:32.443]  We got venison, we got ducks and pheasant and doves, we got fish.
[00:26:32.483 --> 00:26:35.725]  The grandkids were out fishing and they learned how to scale and skin.
[00:26:35.785 --> 00:26:38.066]  By the way, all your viewers out there at Alex Jones,
[00:26:38.484 --> 00:26:42.106]  Of course you scale the fish, because all the flavors in the skin.
[00:26:42.306 --> 00:26:53.093]  But that self-sufficiency, which is the Nugent family, and almost 50 million Americans that learned how to live off the land through the conservation lifestyle, it's catching on more and more.
[00:26:53.113 --> 00:26:58.236]  Do you know, Alex, last year more hunting and fishing licenses were sold than in many years
[00:26:58.516 --> 00:27:10.362]  Because the instinct to be self-sufficient and to provide for your family with your own energy and your own effort and your own conservation participation, I'm telling you, it's really catching on.
[00:27:10.622 --> 00:27:21.088]  And people who attacked me for murdering innocent animals are now starting to realize that venison is pure, it's renewable, it's delicious, and it's much more fun to shop for.
[00:27:22.162 --> 00:27:28.410]  Well, I can't, you know, wait to, uh, myself, get out and do some more fishing, some more hunting, because every time I do, it's like a drug.
[00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:30.012]  It's what we're supposed to do.
[00:27:30.113 --> 00:27:31.815]  You know, for me, gardening's the same way.
[00:27:31.835 --> 00:27:36.381]  We're just hiking through the woods, uh, or, you know, playing catch with my dog, just like you guys do.
[00:27:37.322 --> 00:27:45.205]  That's a normal thing to sit around the campfire and talk to other humans and so I'm glad you went where you've gone because CNN is panicking.
[00:27:45.245 --> 00:27:56.630]  I saw an article this week saying record numbers of African Americans are out buying guns and shooting and hunting and they're getting together with white people and Hispanics and what are we going to do?
[00:27:56.710 --> 00:28:02.312]  So they're losing the fight to disarm us intellectually in the hearts and minds.
[00:28:02.352 --> 00:28:04.153]  Of course they're politically and legislatively
[00:28:05.168 --> 00:28:05.548]  Coming up
[00:28:25.836 --> 00:28:30.642]  Promoting and pushing classic Americana in a time when they were demonizing it and attacking it.
[00:28:30.682 --> 00:28:33.086]  You're the original granddaddy of this whole thing.
[00:28:33.106 --> 00:28:35.409]  It's like Chuck Berry's the granddaddy of rock and roll.
[00:28:36.010 --> 00:28:40.956]  And boom, without you doing this, literally holding it all together, we wouldn't be here.
[00:28:41.216 --> 00:28:42.158]  What is it like now?
[00:28:42.458 --> 00:28:45.058]  Shemane to have this incredible husband, because it's true.
[00:28:45.098 --> 00:28:46.299]  We should celebrate Ted Nugent.
[00:28:46.479 --> 00:28:47.439]  He's been so demonized.
[00:28:47.459 --> 00:28:52.640]  I mean, I remember being like in the 1980s in high school and hearing Ted Nugent attacked and lies.
[00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:54.980]  I was like, why are they saying bad things about Ted Nugent?
[00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:56.140]  Because I loved his music.
[00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:58.141]  Later, I learned because he was a great guy.
[00:28:58.421 --> 00:29:02.102]  Don't listen to a damn thing you rather say until you see it actually out of their mouth.
[00:29:02.462 --> 00:29:10.443]  But literally, what is it like to now see everything you predicted on the bad side coming true, but also the explosion of awakening
[00:29:10.684 --> 00:29:14.662]  Getting back to the earth on the other side, how fulfilling at 72 years of age is that?
[00:29:16.923 --> 00:29:34.679]  Well, it's amazing for me to watch what he's endured and it's been such a learning lesson for me to see that, you know, they attack him because he's not taking their red pill and he's taking God's red pill and he is doing what is right.
[00:29:35.059 --> 00:29:38.122]  He is living clean and sober and they don't like that.
[00:29:38.662 --> 00:29:41.745]  So the more people that attack him, I just want to put this out there,
[00:29:42.915 --> 00:29:44.096]  That's what makes him high.
[00:29:45.157 --> 00:29:46.117]  He gets high off of that.
[00:29:46.137 --> 00:29:52.242]  But it's a great lesson for me to have watched him go through that and not let any of that bother him.
[00:29:52.282 --> 00:30:01.329]  And he just goes and he takes his bow and arrow and he goes outside and he hunts and he listens to Mother Nature and he lets that cleanse his soul.
[00:30:01.429 --> 00:30:03.491]  And I think it's an important lesson for us all.
[00:30:04.878 --> 00:30:06.700]  So really, I mean, nature is the medicine.
[00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:07.701]  That's how you do it, Ted Nugent.
[00:30:07.741 --> 00:30:13.346]  Because I don't even know about yourself, Ted, but I mean, you've been politically active promoting Americana since the 60s.
[00:30:14.867 --> 00:30:16.668]  Well, you know, you see these bags under my eyes.
[00:30:16.709 --> 00:30:17.709]  Don't be confused.
[00:30:17.749 --> 00:30:23.995]  Number one, I have this new music roaring through my system, and it's kind of difficult to sleep at night.
[00:30:24.035 --> 00:30:25.777]  But these are actually ammo bags.
[00:30:25.837 --> 00:30:26.838]  I have Remington ammo.
[00:30:28.214 --> 00:30:32.516]  So the bottom line is, Alex, I was raised in a family where you had to be accountable.
[00:30:32.536 --> 00:30:42.799]  I was raised in a bowhunting family where each step, if it was taken conscientiously and caringly, each step, this is not just metaphoric, it's actual, literal.
[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:55.764]  In the woods, if you really perform stealth and a higher level of awareness, which is very difficult for young Ted, because I've always been hyper, that the reward was getting close to the bird, hearing the song,
[00:30:56.633 --> 00:30:59.074]  Seeing the deer that you hadn't intruded yet.
[00:30:59.835 --> 00:31:04.257]  A clumsy step, the punishment was, you never see Jack squat.
[00:31:04.757 --> 00:31:22.766]  So as a bow hunter, that cause and effect was inescapable, and I felt so fulfilled and gratified getting close to wildlife, not during the hunting season to kill them for the dinner table, but just that spiritual connection, the soul-cleansing powers of nature,
[00:31:23.346 --> 00:31:29.829]  It really helped me deal with the intense, incredible energy of my early bands and my current band.
[00:31:29.869 --> 00:31:35.111]  I mean, today, we had more outrageous energy in the studio this week than at any time in my life.
[00:31:35.531 --> 00:31:36.932]  But I knew that I was right.
[00:31:37.632 --> 00:31:43.675]  I knew that the hippies and the beatniks were attacking me for not smoking their dope and murdering innocent animals.
[00:31:43.715 --> 00:31:46.436]  I'm going, murdering innocent animals?
[00:31:47.233 --> 00:31:56.983]  Maybe this dope does make you really stupid, because what does murdering have to do with accepting a gift from God of pure venison for the family?
[00:31:57.023 --> 00:32:04.411]  And they don't understand that if you don't do it, then they'll all basically starve to death and it's just like harvesting wheat or doing anything else.
[00:32:04.451 --> 00:32:06.193]  It's all about good stewardship.
[00:32:06.293 --> 00:32:07.294]  And speaking of that,
[00:32:07.674 --> 00:32:11.175]  Well, here's one glaring example, and I could keep you here for hundreds of hours with examples of this.
[00:32:11.195 --> 00:32:14.736]  In Colorado, they have an overpopulation, a dangerous overpopulation of black bears, just like up in Lake Tahoe.
[00:32:33.479 --> 00:32:40.145]  But the state says you can't hunt them and you can't use the proven methodologies to balance the population of bears every year.
[00:32:40.426 --> 00:32:51.036]  So you can't hunt in the spring, no reason whatsoever except the lies from the animal rights scammers, and you can't use hounds and bait because somebody in Boulder had a bad, you know, acid trip.
[00:32:51.496 --> 00:32:55.880]  And so we can only hunt in the fall and not harvest an adequate number of bears.
[00:32:56.241 --> 00:32:58.503]  So the government takes our tax dollars
[00:32:58.903 --> 00:33:00.824]  Hires U.S.D.A.
[00:33:00.904 --> 00:33:02.405]  hunters, U.S.D.A.
[00:33:02.485 --> 00:33:10.589]  shooters to go in year-round using hounds and bait that we're not allowed to use, slaughtering these magnificent bears.
[00:33:10.889 --> 00:33:11.949]  Nobody gets to eat them.
[00:33:12.170 --> 00:33:19.233]  Nobody buys license or permits or fees or gas or food or lodging or hotels or restaurants or guides or outfitters or taxidermists.
[00:33:19.513 --> 00:33:23.375]  Each bear could generate tens of thousands of dollars to the economy.
[00:33:23.735 --> 00:33:35.445]  While balancing the population, we don't have to pay a million dollars to the sheep farmers and the cattle farmers and the alpaca farmers and the goat farmers to compensate them for all the black bear deprivation.
[00:33:36.065 --> 00:33:40.269]  So now the black bear is in the liability column instead of the asset column.
[00:33:40.569 --> 00:33:45.193]  And they're still dying, but they're dying after they slaughter livestock.
[00:33:45.533 --> 00:33:47.894]  Endanger people and even kill people.
[00:33:48.255 --> 00:33:52.077]  That's just one example that exists in every state to some degree.
[00:33:52.437 --> 00:33:56.359]  And so Hunter Nation is going, well, the bear is a magnificent creature.
[00:33:56.719 --> 00:33:59.380]  It should be an asset, not a liability.
[00:33:59.601 --> 00:34:08.105]  You shouldn't pay a guy with a backhoe with your tax dollars to bury this beautiful black bear and waste it when it could have been an asset for the entire nation.
[00:34:08.125 --> 00:34:13.188]  And let's expand on that because I know you're a bigger expert on this than probably anybody out there all over the country, but Austin included.
[00:34:14.388 --> 00:34:21.971]  They will pay trappers to come in, live trap starving white-tailed deer and then fly them to West Texas at thousands of dollars apiece.
[00:34:22.331 --> 00:34:26.713]  Totally insane when they just get eaten or die in the desert out there.
[00:34:26.993 --> 00:34:28.273]  This is true insanity.
[00:34:28.573 --> 00:34:36.716]  Crazy weird leftist, ban hunting, restrict it, then it overpopulates and then they bring in, you know, giant expensive operations.
[00:34:36.756 --> 00:34:39.137]  I guess that's another example of what's happening with the black bear?
[00:34:40.185 --> 00:34:43.327]  Yes, well, and a variation of that is existing in every state.
[00:34:43.347 --> 00:34:55.774]  Do you know there are still nine states, Alex, where some government goon tells an American citizen, you only have 50% of the hunting season because we won't allow you to hunt on Sundays.
[00:34:56.094 --> 00:35:04.979]  Can you imagine that there's a law in America that forbids a natural conservation freedom activity like hunting
[00:35:05.692 --> 00:35:10.356]  On Sunday, like somehow nature comes to a halt at sunset on Saturday.
[00:35:10.776 --> 00:35:21.045]  And meanwhile, those deer are slaughtered on the highways instead of feeding families, generating gazillions of dollars in family hours of recreation for the economy.
[00:35:21.525 --> 00:35:22.966]  It exists in every state.
[00:35:23.347 --> 00:35:32.514]  So, and by the way, the deer that they attempt to transport because they didn't allow us to harvest them responsibly, do you know that 80% of them die while they're being handled?
[00:35:32.834 --> 00:35:34.516]  Because they're being mishandled!
[00:35:34.716 --> 00:35:38.379]  They're supposed to be killed and grilled, not relocated.
[00:35:38.399 --> 00:35:40.701]  It literally...
[00:35:41.141 --> 00:35:57.948]  Planet of the cuckoo's nest out there because the hippies in their comfortable numbness, which is actually uncomfortable numb nutness, they've literally had influence from an animal rights scam perspective on wildlife managers, especially the Texas Parks and Wildlife in Texas.
[00:35:58.188 --> 00:35:59.929]  They should be ashamed of themselves.
[00:36:00.069 --> 00:36:02.670]  And they can come onto your property.
[00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:03.891]  Without a warrant.
[00:36:03.911 --> 00:36:04.731]  Without a warrant.
[00:36:05.356 --> 00:36:06.757]  And kill all of your animals.
[00:36:07.057 --> 00:36:08.017]  And it's happened, Alex.
[00:36:08.037 --> 00:36:16.821]  They've literally broke into whitetail breeding operations, slaughtered entire herds, and then go, well, we thought there was a disease, but there wasn't.
[00:36:16.861 --> 00:36:18.782]  But I'm sorry, we ruined your livelihood.
[00:36:19.163 --> 00:36:21.304]  See ya in Texas, Alex.
[00:36:21.584 --> 00:36:23.745]  How dare they do that in Texas?
[00:36:23.805 --> 00:36:29.888]  And the new Bureau of Land Management lady they're trying to approve says she's against hunting and wants to, quote, depopulate humans.
[00:36:29.908 --> 00:36:30.408]  Did you see that?
[00:36:31.365 --> 00:36:32.445]  Yes, that's it.
[00:36:32.865 --> 00:36:33.546]  Where else?
[00:36:33.846 --> 00:36:35.866]  How more demonic can you get?
[00:36:36.987 --> 00:36:37.307]  All right.
[00:36:37.367 --> 00:36:38.847]  Well, listen, I love you guys.
[00:36:38.887 --> 00:36:39.827]  I appreciate you guys.
[00:36:39.867 --> 00:36:40.728]  I don't want to keep you too long.
[00:36:40.748 --> 00:36:42.008]  So you've got to get back in the studio.
[00:36:42.028 --> 00:36:43.288]  I appreciate you coming on the Saturday show.
[00:36:43.308 --> 00:36:45.489]  But Shemane, you've always got a ton to say.
[00:36:45.569 --> 00:36:46.349]  I love listening to you.
[00:36:46.369 --> 00:36:48.750]  I love watching you as much as your great husband.
[00:36:49.110 --> 00:36:52.211]  What else do you want to say to the audience of viewers and listeners out there about
[00:36:52.691 --> 00:36:56.115]  You know what they can do because I love the fact that you're trying to give people spirits up.
[00:36:56.895 --> 00:36:59.758]  I know you said you heard me a few days ago and I sounded bummed out.
[00:37:00.119 --> 00:37:07.707]  I was and I try to be positive like you guys are and I am sometimes but just any other ways we stay positive any other points you like to make.
[00:37:08.715 --> 00:37:10.377]  Well, you know, we all go through that.
[00:37:10.457 --> 00:37:13.239]  I mean, my neck is sore from shaking my head so much.
[00:37:13.299 --> 00:37:17.123]  Every time I turn on the TV or radio, there's so much negative.
[00:37:17.503 --> 00:37:21.807]  But what's really important, Alex, is that, again, we find the thing that makes our heart sing.
[00:37:21.867 --> 00:37:23.008]  God gave us a gift.
[00:37:23.429 --> 00:37:32.797]  Our goal, I think, our mission in life is to share that gift with others and to take time to set aside time to be healthy, to do something healthy for your body.
[00:37:32.817 --> 00:37:34.339]  Because if you don't feel good,
[00:37:35.205 --> 00:37:37.226]  You can't be happy, truly, inside.
[00:37:37.286 --> 00:37:42.528]  So that's most important, but also do not give up.
[00:37:42.868 --> 00:37:51.892]  Now more than ever, we who have been sitting on the sidelines, not you and Ted, but those of us who have been sitting on the sidelines need to stand up.
[00:37:51.992 --> 00:37:56.674]  We need to be bold and brave and let our voices be heard.
[00:37:57.094 --> 00:37:58.815]  I got banned on Twitter.
[00:37:59.055 --> 00:38:04.237]  He's still on Twitter, but I'm banned because I posted a silly video about President Trump.
[00:38:04.901 --> 00:38:10.604]  We lost our First Amendment, they're coming after the Second, and the next thing they're coming after is the Bible.
[00:38:11.064 --> 00:38:17.007]  So, calling all patriots, calling all Christians, now more than ever, get out there and preach.
[00:38:17.928 --> 00:38:19.629]  And I want listeners to understand something.
[00:38:20.109 --> 00:38:27.473]  They may not be Ted Nugent and have tens of millions of followers online, but it's their videos they shoot on the street or their commentary
[00:38:27.873 --> 00:38:28.253]  We're good to go.
[00:38:44.045 --> 00:38:46.267]  Or when you see the archive of it at Band.Video.
[00:38:46.787 --> 00:38:47.868]  Share it on your email list.
[00:38:47.948 --> 00:38:49.189]  Share it on your text message.
[00:38:49.669 --> 00:38:51.230]  You know, share it with Ted Nugent.
[00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:52.491]  You know, Ted shares these videos.
[00:38:52.511 --> 00:38:55.253]  Instead of them getting 300,000 views, they get 5 million views.
[00:38:55.613 --> 00:39:00.056]  And just realize that they're suppressing us because the truth is popular.
[00:39:00.076 --> 00:39:02.878]  They wouldn't be suppressing us if we didn't have a very good shot of winning.
[00:39:02.898 --> 00:39:04.660]  So listeners and viewers have to know
[00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:07.501]  You're not just half the equation, you're 99% of it.
[00:39:07.561 --> 00:39:13.943]  Because if Ted Nugent was playing his guitar all by himself, you know, in the middle of the forest, God would hear it, it would sound great.
[00:39:14.263 --> 00:39:19.584]  But, you know, it takes people coming to a concert, being there, having that communal event.
[00:39:19.804 --> 00:39:30.668]  Well, just like you need to come to a concert for the communal event, you need to go to the City Council, you need to go to Congress, we need to get back in the streets, peacefully, and let the world know that our numbers are way greater than the left.
[00:39:30.868 --> 00:39:31.868]  They're trying to gaslight us?
[00:39:32.128 --> 00:39:33.108]  They're trying to break our will.
[00:39:33.128 --> 00:39:34.409]  They're trying to overwhelm us.
[00:39:34.469 --> 00:39:37.490]  This is signs of weakness, in my view, not signs of strength.
[00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:49.513]  So both of you, take some time, because you've got so many sites, so many great organizations, to let these activist viewers we've got see them and share them, and then tell others that when they share it, please share it again, and then tell those to share it.
[00:39:49.733 --> 00:39:52.254]  And it's that chain reaction that the tyrants fear.
[00:39:52.294 --> 00:39:54.175]  So how do we trigger that chain reaction?
[00:39:55.015 --> 00:39:57.996]  Sixty seconds from each one of you on that, and I'll let you get back to recording studio.
[00:39:59.062 --> 00:40:00.862]  Well, we talk about strength and weakness.
[00:40:00.942 --> 00:40:03.843]  I see a lot of strength out there in reaction to weakness.
[00:40:03.883 --> 00:40:08.584]  We also support a charity called FullCircleProgram.com.
[00:40:09.064 --> 00:40:11.265]  FullCircleProgram.com.
[00:40:11.625 --> 00:40:17.906]  Young Americans helping fellow young Americans during these stressful times where addiction is off the charts.
[00:40:18.367 --> 00:40:20.587]  FullCircleProgram.com.
[00:40:20.887 --> 00:40:23.788]  American youth helping American youth.
[00:40:23.928 --> 00:40:24.988]  A show of strength.
[00:40:25.808 --> 00:40:26.248]  Beautiful.
[00:40:26.789 --> 00:40:28.369]  Shemaine, any other sites people should check out?
[00:40:29.562 --> 00:40:32.526]  Well, I can be followed on social media.
[00:40:33.066 --> 00:40:46.904]  What I do have left on my Facebook and also Instagram and my website is ShemaineNugent.rocks and I have a lot of great programs for women to have supernatural health and to age gracefully.
[00:40:48.387 --> 00:40:49.087]  Well you're amazing.
[00:40:49.227 --> 00:40:50.628]  One little final point I forgot to ask.
[00:40:50.688 --> 00:40:53.209]  Republicans are questioning whether they want Trump again.
[00:40:53.229 --> 00:40:55.110]  That's townhall.com.
[00:40:56.190 --> 00:40:59.812]  Every person that he supports for Congress is winning by record numbers.
[00:41:00.472 --> 00:41:01.713]  The system fears Trump.
[00:41:01.753 --> 00:41:05.455]  We need to keep him as a Republican Party leader even if he doesn't run again.
[00:41:06.435 --> 00:41:14.939]  How do we get folks out there to understand that they have to be heard that we want Trump to continue to be the leader and he needs to hear that or he's going to kind of bow out, I've been told.
[00:41:16.172 --> 00:41:20.557]  Well, again, I say call your mayor, your congressman, your governor.
[00:41:21.257 --> 00:41:24.541]  Go to the school board meeting and just blurt out, we support Donald Trump!
[00:41:25.367 --> 00:41:28.770]  We like what Donald Trump did to make America better.
[00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:32.233]  He brought upgrade quality of life to America.
[00:41:32.773 --> 00:41:38.818]  Joe Biden and his gang of puppets have degraded the quality of life in America on every level.
[00:41:39.038 --> 00:41:49.287]  So just voicing support to your mayor, your senator, your congressman, your governor, just voicing support for Donald Trump is a huge sucker punch to the left.
[00:41:50.107 --> 00:41:50.688]  Absolutely.
[00:41:50.868 --> 00:41:53.310]  All right, guys, thank you so much for your time.
[00:41:53.330 --> 00:41:54.331]  When's the new album coming out?
[00:41:55.475 --> 00:41:58.197]  Well, you know, it's called Ted Nugent Detroit Muscle.
[00:41:58.437 --> 00:41:59.698]  And you mentioned campfire.
[00:41:59.718 --> 00:42:01.739]  It's got a song called American Campfire.
[00:42:02.079 --> 00:42:04.361]  Everybody loves the American campfire.
[00:42:04.641 --> 00:42:06.282]  Don't you hear it calling your name?
[00:42:06.662 --> 00:42:09.063]  Everybody loves the American campfire.
[00:42:09.344 --> 00:42:09.924]  Go ahead.
[00:42:10.364 --> 00:42:11.665]  Fan the flames.
[00:42:11.905 --> 00:42:13.726]  Hopefully it'll be out sometime this fall.
[00:42:14.307 --> 00:42:14.567]  All right.
[00:42:14.627 --> 00:42:15.227]  God bless you.
[00:42:15.247 --> 00:42:16.128]  Have a great weekend.
[00:42:17.093 --> 00:42:18.074]  Alright, God bless Alex.
[00:42:18.094 --> 00:42:19.615]  Godspeed Alex, thanks for everything man.
[00:42:19.835 --> 00:42:20.535]  Thank you so much.
[00:42:20.595 --> 00:42:23.757]  Alright, there goes Ted Nugent and his amazing wife Shemaine Nugent.
[00:42:24.117 --> 00:42:25.938]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com.

[00:43:39.127 --> 00:43:53.034]  And again, I want to thank all of our listeners and all of our viewers tuning in on Saturday evening for an exclusive interview with the Bitcoin King, Max Keiser.
[00:43:53.654 --> 00:43:55.675]  And again, he tried to get me involved 10 years ago.
[00:43:55.715 --> 00:43:58.917]  He tried to get me involved just three years ago.
[00:43:59.057 --> 00:43:59.637]  I didn't do it.
[00:43:59.717 --> 00:44:02.639]  Regardless, it's a great alternate currency.
[00:44:03.239 --> 00:44:06.361]  It's something the power structure doesn't want us involved in.
[00:44:07.475 --> 00:44:08.876]  And so that's why I'm involved in it.
[00:44:08.956 --> 00:44:15.118]  But regardless, it is certainly an illustration of how scared the system is of new currency.
[00:44:15.158 --> 00:44:24.543]  So, Max Keiser, thanks for coming on, on this Saturday Transmission, looking at all the craziness happening in the world before we get into Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.
[00:44:24.963 --> 00:44:27.684]  What do you make of inflation that you've been predicting will be a problem?
[00:44:28.084 --> 00:44:31.006]  What do you make of all the political things that are unfolding?
[00:44:31.066 --> 00:44:34.027]  Joe Biden whispering at reporters.
[00:44:34.067 --> 00:44:36.108]  What would you call this point we're at?
[00:44:38.271 --> 00:44:40.112]  Well, let's talk about inflation for a second.
[00:44:40.132 --> 00:44:50.496]  So inflation, which you could talk about in terms of the skyrocketing costs in education, in health care, in housing, is real.
[00:44:50.736 --> 00:44:54.418]  And then the inflation in food and energy is real.
[00:44:54.738 --> 00:44:56.258]  And it's been building for years.
[00:44:56.999 --> 00:45:07.203]  And it's hidden using a technique by central banks to buy all the Treasury bonds that the federal government issues.
[00:45:08.410 --> 00:45:09.710]  To keep interest rates low.
[00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:17.212]  And then what happens is the central bank will go to Washington and say, we don't see any inflation because interest rates are so low.
[00:45:17.972 --> 00:45:21.473]  He'll say, you know, if there was inflation, interest rates would be high.
[00:45:22.253 --> 00:45:28.435]  OK, so that's how they disguise the inflation by engaging in what's called quantitative easing.
[00:45:29.035 --> 00:45:32.656]  They buy back all the paper to keep interest rates artificially
[00:45:33.237 --> 00:45:33.477]  Low.
[00:45:33.677 --> 00:45:43.925]  Well, what happens is that those inflationary pressures build up behind this dam, this artificial dam of quantitative easing until such time as they can't mask it anymore.
[00:45:43.965 --> 00:45:45.146]  They can't hide it anymore.
[00:45:45.767 --> 00:45:47.108]  And it starts to get out of control.
[00:45:47.128 --> 00:45:54.253]  And once the inflation gets out of control, what happens, Alex, is that you it's called letting the inflation genie out of the bottle.
[00:45:54.533 --> 00:46:00.478]  People start to panic buy stuff because they're afraid that prices are going to go up and that causes more inflation.
[00:46:00.953 --> 00:46:04.395]  And we see that typically in countries in the South America and Central America.
[00:46:04.795 --> 00:46:10.838]  And I don't want to talk about Bitcoin at this very instant, but that's why countries like El Salvador and now Paraguay are moving into Bitcoin.
[00:46:11.118 --> 00:46:22.323]  But to answer your question about inflation, it's really starting to become an uncontrollable economic disaster.
[00:46:23.064 --> 00:46:29.627]  And the interest rates are so low that any attempt to taper or to raise interest rates
[00:46:30.026 --> 00:46:35.969]  Would immediately force every bank and insurance company to go into foreclosure because they're so leveraged.
[00:46:36.029 --> 00:46:38.271]  They're leveraged 100 to 1, 200 to 1.
[00:46:38.331 --> 00:46:39.591]  The leverage is astronomical.
[00:46:39.631 --> 00:46:44.334]  Never in history has ever an economy been leveraged more than the American economy today.
[00:46:44.534 --> 00:46:48.236]  The Federal Reserve itself is leveraged, I think, 70 to 1.
[00:46:48.396 --> 00:46:54.340]  It's leveraged much more than Enron was before Enron collapsed or any of these other companies before they collapsed.
[00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:57.702]  They think that they can simply defy gravity.
[00:46:58.022 --> 00:46:59.803]  They can defy the laws of physics.
[00:47:00.151 --> 00:47:02.473]  They can defy the laws of thermodynamics.
[00:47:02.913 --> 00:47:09.619]  They can simply talk their way through this catastrophe and it's not working.
[00:47:09.759 --> 00:47:15.524]  And now we're at the tail end of the illusion and we're starting to see real inflation.
[00:47:15.744 --> 00:47:19.207]  And this is what people, you know, you've been talking about problems for a long time.
[00:47:19.267 --> 00:47:21.328]  I've been talking about problems for a long time.
[00:47:21.348 --> 00:47:26.853]  But, you know, usually people look at this and their eyes glaze over and they say, oh, I don't know.
[00:47:27.293 --> 00:47:28.174]  My life's OK.
[00:47:28.194 --> 00:47:29.195]  I don't see what the problem is.
[00:47:29.602 --> 00:47:34.465]  But now when they go to the store and they see prices are up 20, 25 percent, they're like, what's going on?
[00:47:34.505 --> 00:47:35.065]  What's happening?
[00:47:35.085 --> 00:47:36.186]  That's my next question.
[00:47:36.246 --> 00:47:39.208]  Historically, how does this unfold?
[00:47:39.288 --> 00:47:40.348]  How does this unwind?
[00:47:42.149 --> 00:47:44.331]  It unwinds and unfolds by the U.S.
[00:47:44.371 --> 00:47:49.094]  dollar losing purchasing power more rapidly than it already is.
[00:47:49.134 --> 00:47:50.594]  You'd see a currency collapse.
[00:47:51.555 --> 00:47:56.598]  And if you're talking about World Reserve currency, that would have ripple effects all over the world.
[00:47:56.991 --> 00:48:00.433]  The reason why we haven't seen it so far is because the U.S.
[00:48:00.473 --> 00:48:02.934]  dollar is backed by the U.S.
[00:48:02.974 --> 00:48:11.457]  military, and we see inflation and hyperinflation happening in countries around the world that are forced to deal with all this money printing as part of U.S.
[00:48:11.497 --> 00:48:13.678]  foreign policy, as far as U.S.
[00:48:13.738 --> 00:48:14.459]  trade policy.
[00:48:15.279 --> 00:48:17.120]  But just like this, I'll give you another example.
[00:48:17.947 --> 00:48:30.520]  The policies of America to spy on other countries and to infiltrate elections in other countries and to interfere in other countries through coups and overthrows
[00:48:31.024 --> 00:48:35.786]  Eventually America kind of ran out of countries to overthrow, so they overthrew their own country.
[00:48:36.046 --> 00:48:44.869]  So now we have spying in our own country, we have coups in our own country, we have all that stuff that we exported to around the world is now coming home.
[00:48:44.889 --> 00:48:48.210]  I was about to say, what do you make of Biden and their official U.S.
[00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:52.031]  government policy last week saying white supremacists are the main threat?
[00:48:52.391 --> 00:48:58.033]  They define it as those that question gun control, elections, and
[00:49:01.485 --> 00:49:11.072]  Checkpoints and environmental control groups involved in contact tracing or those that protest forced inoculation.
[00:49:11.692 --> 00:49:16.356]  I mean, that is an extremely huge statement to say the new U.S.
[00:49:16.376 --> 00:49:19.077]  government policy is to go after the American people.
[00:49:20.659 --> 00:49:20.879]  Right.
[00:49:20.919 --> 00:49:27.824]  What's sad about it is that when the country clamps down on free speech like that, it shows their total lack of self-confidence.
[00:49:28.944 --> 00:49:31.086]  And this is what happens in dictatorships.
[00:49:31.607 --> 00:49:33.188]  It's what happens in North Korea, right?
[00:49:33.208 --> 00:49:35.909]  You can't make jokes about the leadership in North Korea.
[00:49:35.949 --> 00:49:42.751]  You get in trouble because the North Korean leadership is extremely insecure, you know, and paranoid.
[00:49:43.612 --> 00:49:57.557]  So here in America, instead of having the confidence that America used to have to let free speech reign and to let the cookie crumble, as it were, we've become extremely paranoid and lost all self-confidence.
[00:49:57.677 --> 00:50:00.518]  So now we're imposing draconian censorship.
[00:50:01.078 --> 00:50:02.758]  On our own people here in the United States.
[00:50:02.798 --> 00:50:04.619]  So it shows that the U.S.
[00:50:04.719 --> 00:50:07.219]  Empire is going away of all other empires.
[00:50:07.559 --> 00:50:08.860]  They've overextended themselves.
[00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:10.260]  They've over indebted themselves.
[00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:15.941]  And now the few remaining kleptocrats are scrambling to grab as much as they can.
[00:50:15.961 --> 00:50:21.362]  And then they'll disappear, they think, they hope, to Switzerland or who knows where.
[00:50:21.522 --> 00:50:25.483]  But it shows it's emblematic of an empire in decline.
[00:50:26.701 --> 00:50:29.362]  Well, again, I wish Biden would succeed.
[00:50:29.402 --> 00:50:30.883]  I'm not even against Biden.
[00:50:31.243 --> 00:50:33.044]  Trump's gone now, so let's remove him from the equation.
[00:50:33.464 --> 00:50:35.625]  What do you make of Biden's performances?
[00:50:35.645 --> 00:50:39.867]  Let me play a clip in a moment where he's whispering into microphones.
[00:50:39.927 --> 00:50:42.668]  He's saying, I gave you free money.
[00:50:42.688 --> 00:50:45.449]  I mean, this is something out of like a fever dream.
[00:50:45.790 --> 00:50:47.810]  Here's a clip of President Biden.
[00:50:48.631 --> 00:50:53.233]  I got them $1.9 trillion relief so far.
[00:50:54.155 --> 00:50:57.277]  They're going to be getting checks in the mail that are consequential.
[00:50:57.957 --> 00:51:00.858]  I wrote the bill on the environment.
[00:51:02.179 --> 00:51:03.079]  Pay them more.
[00:51:05.381 --> 00:51:10.343]  This is an employee's bargaining chip now.
[00:51:11.684 --> 00:51:12.404]  What's happening?
[00:51:13.605 --> 00:51:15.085]  So what is happening, Max Keiser?
[00:51:16.486 --> 00:51:22.269]  Well, it's no secret that Mr. Biden has some cognitive decline.
[00:51:22.970 --> 00:51:29.676]  I mean, we all have parents, and many of us have parents in their senior years, and we've witnessed what happens.
[00:51:30.477 --> 00:51:34.180]  You have cognitive decline, and there are various stages in that cognitive decline.
[00:51:34.741 --> 00:51:38.765]  And once it starts, it can start to deteriorate quite rapidly.
[00:51:38.985 --> 00:51:47.673]  I saw he was at a speech recently where he forgot to mention the tragedy in Miami recently at the condo that collapsed, and then Vice President Harris had to
[00:51:48.049 --> 00:51:48.349]  Boris Yeltsin!
[00:52:16.823 --> 00:52:20.546]  Joe Biden could be definitely compared to Boris Yeltsin.
[00:52:21.227 --> 00:52:21.747]  And the U.S.
[00:52:21.807 --> 00:52:26.511]  used to make fun of these types of countries that were being led by senile old fools.
[00:52:26.932 --> 00:52:29.554]  You know, and now that's the chickens have come home to roost.
[00:52:29.574 --> 00:52:35.039]  We didn't have enough self-confidence to have a really fair election in 2020.
[00:52:35.559 --> 00:52:43.726]  So, you know, mainstream media, Time Magazine, ran a cover story about how they essentially threw that election and they were quite proud of it.
[00:52:44.281 --> 00:52:47.823]  Because they thought that was in the best interest of, I guess, who?
[00:52:47.983 --> 00:52:50.924]  Oh, Time Warner, the corporation.
[00:52:51.165 --> 00:52:53.286]  But these things have consequences, Alex.
[00:52:53.366 --> 00:52:57.268]  You can't throw a country under the bus like that and expect there not to be consequences.
[00:52:57.308 --> 00:53:00.489]  And the rest of the world is looking at this and saying, hey, you know what?
[00:53:00.509 --> 00:53:03.831]  We need to get out of the dollar quick because it's about to go up in flames.
[00:53:04.455 --> 00:53:09.857]  And all over Central America now, eight countries are starting to adopt Bitcoin as their legal tensor.
[00:53:09.897 --> 00:53:22.203]  Well, that was my next question, and we'll talk about Africa, we'll talk about Latin America, we'll talk about the response to this, but looking at the players, as you're a smart guy, I respect your view, looking at Asia, looking at Africa, Middle East, Europe,
[00:53:22.723 --> 00:53:28.485]  Eastern Europe, Russia, North America, Central America, South America, the players, who are the strong leaders?
[00:53:29.005 --> 00:53:32.926]  Who is, who's doing well in this, you know, bad neighborhood?
[00:53:32.946 --> 00:53:36.247]  I mean, everything's in trouble, but who are the leaders?
[00:53:36.287 --> 00:53:36.968]  Who are the losers?
[00:53:37.028 --> 00:53:38.828]  And how do you see the breaks unfolding?
[00:53:40.669 --> 00:53:45.050]  Well, you know, Russia has been, has a strong leadership.
[00:53:45.130 --> 00:53:49.312]  I mean, they've been paying down all their debt for, for, uh, 20 years.
[00:53:49.492 --> 00:53:50.532]  They have virtually no debt.
[00:53:51.135 --> 00:53:55.839]  They've been buying hundreds and hundreds of tons of gold and now they're completely out of the U.S.
[00:53:55.859 --> 00:53:56.159]  dollar.
[00:53:56.439 --> 00:53:58.561]  They divested themselves completely out of the U.S.
[00:53:58.581 --> 00:53:58.901]  dollar.
[00:53:59.101 --> 00:54:02.264]  So they're no longer under the yoke of U.S.
[00:54:02.284 --> 00:54:04.506]  dollar hegemony has been removed.
[00:54:04.566 --> 00:54:06.467]  So that all those are really smart moves.
[00:54:06.547 --> 00:54:09.690]  The country is doing, you know, well, relatively.
[00:54:10.631 --> 00:54:15.955]  Then you have in Africa countries that are essentially leapfrogging the
[00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:27.749]  All of the technologies in the telephony business that were required to be part of the banking system and all of the legacy banking infrastructure, they're leapfrogging and they're going right into Bitcoin.
[00:54:28.029 --> 00:54:30.711]  So you have four or five countries, particularly Nigeria.
[00:54:30.731 --> 00:54:34.374]  Nigeria is going to become much bigger than the United States within five years.
[00:54:34.815 --> 00:54:36.296]  They've got over 200 million people.
[00:54:36.336 --> 00:54:37.577]  The average age is quite low.
[00:54:38.337 --> 00:54:41.200]  30% of the country is already hyper Bitcoinization.
[00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:42.621]  They use Bitcoin every single day.
[00:54:42.661 --> 00:54:45.463]  They're totally divorced from the corrupt banking system.
[00:54:45.814 --> 00:54:47.515]  And that's spreading all over Africa.
[00:54:47.655 --> 00:54:49.795]  Africa is the fastest growing region in the world.
[00:54:50.496 --> 00:54:55.897]  And that's, if you were a young person and you want to get rich, the place to go would be in Africa.
[00:54:56.158 --> 00:55:04.581]  Those countries are just being transformed before our very eyes into hyper growth, very exciting entrepreneurial opportunities happening.
[00:55:04.601 --> 00:55:06.581]  So you're saying Africa is the next boom.
[00:55:06.621 --> 00:55:08.442]  Like China's been for 40 years.
[00:55:08.482 --> 00:55:09.482]  You say Africa's it.
[00:55:10.503 --> 00:55:11.903]  Yeah, that's exactly right.
[00:55:11.963 --> 00:55:14.604]  China had it since the Clintons.
[00:55:15.054 --> 00:55:17.075]  Included China in the World Trade Organization.
[00:55:17.435 --> 00:55:20.255]  They had that GDP growth that was up phenomenally.
[00:55:20.596 --> 00:55:23.556]  Became a $17-18 trillion economy.
[00:55:23.576 --> 00:55:26.857]  I think at the beginning of the process, it was less than half a trillion.
[00:55:27.417 --> 00:55:40.421]  And now it's Africa, I'm sorry, China's kind of tapering off because they've got some structural problems with their economy and they've allowed their debt to grow exponentially as well.
[00:55:40.761 --> 00:55:42.842]  Whereas in Africa, it's kind of a clean slate.
[00:55:42.902 --> 00:55:43.302]  You've got
[00:55:43.880 --> 00:55:52.285]  The ability to reinvent commerce and monetary policy using Bitcoin and, and, and apps that support Bitcoin.
[00:55:52.626 --> 00:55:54.387]  And we just see it, we see it happening already.
[00:55:54.427 --> 00:55:59.089]  So Kenya, Ethiopia, Nigeria, these countries are exploding.
[00:55:59.170 --> 00:56:02.852]  The growth is happening and it's very entrepreneurial.
[00:56:02.992 --> 00:56:11.237]  And I think the US led by an octogenarian who is clearly showing signs of cognitive decline.
[00:56:11.926 --> 00:56:22.093]  China, which has got huge debt problems, and Europe, which is plagued by the European Central Bank under Christine Lagarde, and they are suffering pretty substantially at the moment.
[00:56:22.974 --> 00:56:28.418]  But when you get to Africa, it's like, wow, you know, this thing is really growing, and it's some great opportunities there.
[00:56:29.278 --> 00:56:30.679]  Let's talk Bitcoin now.
[00:56:31.740 --> 00:56:32.681]  So much is happening.
[00:56:32.701 --> 00:56:34.682]  You're on a quest against Elon Musk.
[00:56:35.123 --> 00:56:35.483]  Why?
[00:56:35.563 --> 00:56:36.363]  Who is Elon?
[00:56:37.184 --> 00:56:37.845]  Bitcoin?
[00:56:38.485 --> 00:56:39.726]  Let's go over the numbers here.
[00:56:41.192 --> 00:56:41.372]  Right.
[00:56:41.412 --> 00:56:56.026]  So Elon, and I've been at Bitcoin for 10 years, and every year or two, some personality emerges and tries to become the face of Bitcoin and to try to steer people away from the core attributes of Bitcoin.
[00:56:56.807 --> 00:57:03.293]  And Elon appeared and he started talking about the energy usage of Bitcoin and why this is not environmentally sound.
[00:57:03.911 --> 00:57:08.535]  And speaking in ways that were clearly, provably, demonstrably false.
[00:57:08.635 --> 00:57:11.257]  It's unclear what his motive is.
[00:57:11.277 --> 00:57:18.022]  I know that his entire business is tied to carbon credits from the government, from both the U.S.
[00:57:18.122 --> 00:57:19.804]  and also from subsidies from China.
[00:57:20.184 --> 00:57:23.447]  So he's not exactly an unconflicted business person.
[00:57:24.147 --> 00:57:27.650]  And Bitcoin challenges those establishments.
[00:57:27.850 --> 00:57:28.831]  So there's that.
[00:57:29.011 --> 00:57:32.494]  I mean, that could clearly be motivating him to spread a lot of misinformation.
[00:57:32.990 --> 00:57:49.334]  And so this tour I've put together, the F Elon Tour, it's really aimed at all those people like Mark Cuban or Elon Musk or any number of folks, Nouriel Roubini, Peter Schiff, Paul Krugman.
[00:57:49.374 --> 00:57:59.337]  There's a long list of people who have very publicly come out and stated imbecilities and falsehoods as it relates to Bitcoin.
[00:57:59.897 --> 00:58:02.298]  And my job for the past 10 years, as well as
[00:58:02.691 --> 00:58:13.821]  What are called the OG's, you know, of Bitcoin or the plebs, as they're known sometimes, is to try to make the public aware that there is nobody at the center of Bitcoin.
[00:58:13.841 --> 00:58:15.603]  Bitcoin is decentralized.
[00:58:15.823 --> 00:58:17.424]  It works on its own merits.
[00:58:17.504 --> 00:58:24.511]  It's happening and it's attracting capital in a world that's going hyperinflation and people are looking for a safe haven and a store of value.
[00:58:24.871 --> 00:58:26.012]  They've only got two options.
[00:58:27.230 --> 00:58:31.672]  One is gold and the other is Bitcoin, and Bitcoin is far superior to gold.
[00:58:32.072 --> 00:58:33.192]  It's... Let me bring this up.
[00:58:33.212 --> 00:58:35.873]  I'm not a rocket scientist, but look at the 11-year graph.
[00:58:36.513 --> 00:58:41.075]  It's following the exact same pattern it followed the two big times before.
[00:58:41.095 --> 00:58:44.316]  It looks like it's about to go straight up if history repeats itself.
[00:58:45.937 --> 00:58:49.138]  Yeah, well, it's tied to what's called the halving cycle.
[00:58:49.218 --> 00:58:55.580]  So every four years, the amount of coins that are distributed by the miners every 10 minutes gets cut in half.
[00:58:56.235 --> 00:59:05.198]  And so that means that the existing demand for the coin has a much greater impact on price for one thing.
[00:59:06.198 --> 00:59:08.739]  What we've seen in the last week or two is remarkable.
[00:59:09.039 --> 00:59:09.820]  Think about this, Alex.
[00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:20.183]  So Bitcoin runs on a hash rate or calculations of it was running at 170 quintillion calculations per second to run the network.
[00:59:20.323 --> 00:59:25.685]  To put that in the context, if you were to count up every grain of sand on planet Earth, it would be about seven
[00:59:26.237 --> 00:59:26.757]  Quintillion.
[00:59:27.158 --> 00:59:31.001]  So the Bitcoin network's running on 170 quintillion calculations per second.
[00:59:31.481 --> 00:59:38.346]  So it was the Chinese government came out and basically banned Bitcoin mining in China.
[00:59:38.867 --> 00:59:47.173]  So what happened is that half, it's called half or 40% of all that calculation, all that computer power essentially moved.
[00:59:47.393 --> 00:59:48.654]  And a lot of it's moving to Texas.
[00:59:49.475 --> 00:59:55.199]  And all that happened in the space of a few days and nothing disrupted the network.
[00:59:56.084 --> 01:00:00.428]  It was one of the most remarkable achievements in engineering in human history.
[01:00:00.748 --> 01:00:05.712]  The entire industry was moved from China to mostly now Texas and a little bit of California.
[01:00:05.732 --> 01:00:06.833]  So a true virtual network.
[01:00:08.435 --> 01:00:08.595]  Right.
[01:00:08.635 --> 01:00:11.277]  The network, the global network, cannot be defeated.
[01:00:11.618 --> 01:00:19.064]  And even though, and people used to say, you know, even six months ago, oh, China dominates Bitcoin, China is China coin, China this, China that.
[01:00:19.525 --> 01:00:28.892]  Okay, well China just banned it and the entire network, the center of gravity of that network, the computational powers to mine these things, went immediately over to where it's welcome.
[01:00:28.952 --> 01:00:29.993]  You got me sold.
[01:00:30.093 --> 01:00:30.773]  I'm sold.
[01:00:30.874 --> 01:00:31.374]  I'm amazed.
[01:00:31.794 --> 01:00:33.556]  So what about John McAfee?
[01:00:33.596 --> 01:00:37.138]  Texas is now a big epicenter, right in your backyard.
[01:00:38.039 --> 01:00:39.040]  The mining operations.
[01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:45.064]  When we're in Austin on July 8th, we're visiting one of the biggest miners in the world.
[01:00:45.124 --> 01:00:47.386]  It's right there, right outside of Austin.
[01:00:47.993 --> 01:00:54.354]  And they're getting energy super cheap, and they are part of this emerging industry, and America should be proud!
[01:00:54.434 --> 01:00:57.315]  I want to cover it, but let's talk about John McAfee.
[01:00:57.875 --> 01:00:59.175]  What do you make of his death?
[01:01:01.696 --> 01:01:12.058]  Well, you know, first of all, as a character in the history of Bitcoin and also the software industry and the computer industry, you know, he is
[01:01:12.771 --> 01:01:18.574]  Unparalleled in his, in his lifestyle that he's the real life Captain Morgan.
[01:01:19.294 --> 01:01:19.494]  Right.
[01:01:19.574 --> 01:01:22.616]  Something from another age, a pirate, a Blackbeard, the pirate.
[01:01:22.976 --> 01:01:28.279]  And I don't think there'll ever be anyone like him again because of our surveillance state that we live in now.
[01:01:28.899 --> 01:01:41.185]  And, and really he, he, he was a remarkable Joseph Conrad, heart of darkness, uh, like character who lived really 10 lives, you know, and he.
[01:01:41.696 --> 01:01:51.782]  He really went past the point of return a few years ago with what he was challenging the world to find him, catch him, and try to stop him.
[01:01:51.862 --> 01:01:53.963]  And he just went to the very, very end.
[01:01:54.764 --> 01:02:00.727]  Unlike, let's say, Jeffrey Epstein characters who had deep, dark secrets about very powerful people.
[01:02:00.847 --> 01:02:04.930]  And anyone who thinks he committed suicide is a jerk.
[01:02:05.550 --> 01:02:08.772]  You know, I don't think in the case of McAfee, that's really the case.
[01:02:08.812 --> 01:02:10.833]  I think he just reached the end of
[01:02:12.437 --> 01:02:17.243]  The thought of being in prison for another two or three or four years and all this.
[01:02:17.784 --> 01:02:19.345]  He's 75 years old.
[01:02:19.586 --> 01:02:26.434]  He's lived one of the most remarkable lives of adventure of anyone in the past hundred years or more.
[01:02:27.075 --> 01:02:28.156]  And I think he checked out.
[01:02:28.276 --> 01:02:29.578]  You know, I saw Anthony Bourdain.
[01:02:29.977 --> 01:02:31.658]  Committed suicide a couple of years ago.
[01:02:31.738 --> 01:02:33.699]  He had an extraordinary life at the age of 61.
[01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:34.920]  Well, there's no doubt.
[01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:37.602]  I mean, I guess you probably met him like I did getting to know him.
[01:02:37.622 --> 01:02:43.106]  And he was like, he was like literally a swashbuckler pirate without trying to be.
[01:02:43.206 --> 01:02:44.186]  He was something else.
[01:02:46.088 --> 01:02:52.652]  He, he really, um, was driven by seemingly a quest to
[01:02:53.888 --> 01:02:57.551]  Have the most amazing, adventurous lifestyle.
[01:02:57.971 --> 01:03:05.436]  You know, this new generation of millennials and Gen Z, they look at a John McAfee character and they see what he was doing.
[01:03:06.737 --> 01:03:17.244]  You know, every possible fantasy that any young man might ever have, this guy lived to an incredible degree.
[01:03:18.105 --> 01:03:20.906]  And he was having a blast.
[01:03:20.967 --> 01:03:22.988]  I don't think he ever had a day where he wasn't
[01:03:23.402 --> 01:03:24.963]  Really having a lot of fun.
[01:03:25.643 --> 01:03:29.625]  And there, he just took it to the nth degree and he got to 75 years old.
[01:03:29.665 --> 01:03:38.369]  That's pretty, you know, a lot of these people like, uh, you know, rock stars like Kurt Cobain or, uh, Jimi Hendrix, or, you know, these people don't make it out into their thirties.
[01:03:38.389 --> 01:03:47.012]  You know, there's John McAfee at 75 living like a fricking rock God being chased around the world and doing all kinds of stuff.
[01:03:47.373 --> 01:03:50.614]  But why does the system chasing, why not leave him alone?
[01:03:52.708 --> 01:03:54.269]  Well, he was breaking a lot of laws.
[01:03:54.369 --> 01:04:00.631]  And once you get on the radar, it only gets, it attracts a lot more, a lot more problems.
[01:04:00.671 --> 01:04:12.335]  So he was encountered, I guess it started in Belize where he was allegedly involved in a murder of one of his neighbors.
[01:04:13.015 --> 01:04:15.296]  And this, this attracted the law enforcement.
[01:04:15.336 --> 01:04:17.417]  And then he, he got to the US where
[01:04:18.821 --> 01:04:20.662]  Those troubles seem to be behind him.
[01:04:21.322 --> 01:04:25.864]  He got involved in the crypto space and he started chasing these altcoins.
[01:04:26.564 --> 01:04:32.066]  You know, I only talk about Bitcoin, Alex, because the altcoin market is so sketchy, so dodgy.
[01:04:32.867 --> 01:04:47.332]  And if you take a character like John McAfee, who was already primed to a life of excess, and you put him into the altcoin market, like Elon Musk with Doge, you know, that's why I tell Elon, you know, you don't want to end up like John McAfee.
[01:04:47.830 --> 01:04:48.050]  Right?
[01:04:48.110 --> 01:04:57.658]  Because Elon, if he keeps chasing these altcoins like Doge, it really screws up your mind and he may end up like McAfee in jail or worse.
[01:04:57.899 --> 01:04:58.299]  That's why.
[01:04:58.737 --> 01:05:05.320]  I think we need to help, you know, stage an intervention and get Elon off the crack pipe of the Dogecoin.
[01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:06.641]  Well, that was my next question.
[01:05:06.741 --> 01:05:09.423]  Elon Musk, what is his real deal?
[01:05:09.443 --> 01:05:12.704]  Because I just see him manipulating Bitcoin.
[01:05:13.425 --> 01:05:16.626]  He wants to launch it, then buy out of it, and then go back into it.
[01:05:16.986 --> 01:05:19.628]  I mean, I really see it as kind of an insider trading operation.
[01:05:20.608 --> 01:05:24.790]  Yeah, he wants to be the most influential person in Bitcoin.
[01:05:24.830 --> 01:05:25.711]  And we've seen this before.
[01:05:26.343 --> 01:05:34.329]  Back in 2013, 2014, we had Roger Ver and a guy whose first name is Craig.
[01:05:34.489 --> 01:05:39.653]  I'm not even going to say his whole name because they've got like a team of 100 lawyers and they're very, very litigious.
[01:05:40.113 --> 01:05:42.515]  But they try to fork the corn.
[01:05:42.955 --> 01:05:44.857]  They claim to be Satoshi.
[01:05:46.126 --> 01:05:50.067]  And they made all these ridiculous statements that have proven false again and again.
[01:05:50.428 --> 01:05:59.510]  But because this market, the way it is, these projects gain multi-billion dollar valuations and they generated a lot of cash to fund these operations.
[01:06:00.451 --> 01:06:03.672]  And so it attracts narcissists and egomaniacs.
[01:06:04.172 --> 01:06:11.034]  So about a year ago or so, it attracted Elon Musk, who he is a narcissist and an egomaniac.
[01:06:11.074 --> 01:06:13.495]  He also has a stock with Tesla.
[01:06:13.973 --> 01:06:15.694]  That has done remarkably well.
[01:06:15.754 --> 01:06:18.276]  So it's not like he is coming from nowhere.
[01:06:18.336 --> 01:06:23.921]  He's sitting on top of the Tesla stock, which has made him at one point.
[01:06:23.961 --> 01:06:26.843]  No doubt he got a heavy lifting in the space.
[01:06:26.923 --> 01:06:28.644]  I mean, people call him a con artist.
[01:06:28.664 --> 01:06:30.005]  Well, I'll take con artists like this all day.
[01:06:30.025 --> 01:06:30.706]  He's been successful.
[01:06:32.567 --> 01:06:35.650]  Every, you know, America is fake it till you make it.
[01:06:35.970 --> 01:06:37.591]  It was founded by people like Elon.
[01:06:38.232 --> 01:06:38.972]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:06:39.052 --> 01:06:42.175]  Behind every American success story, you know, there's a little
[01:06:43.072 --> 01:06:43.632]  Sure, Captain Crunch!
[01:07:10.118 --> 01:07:23.283]  What happens a lot of times is that people become, they develop something of a God complex, and they can go the way of, you know, we've seen many of these CEOs flame out and become completely obsessed.
[01:07:23.303 --> 01:07:39.630]  The guy who was running Subway, the 30,000 strong franchisee of that sandwich shop, died recently, and now it's come out that his lifestyle and what he was doing for 20, 30 years was just like John McAfee style insanity, where he was
[01:07:40.441 --> 01:07:43.644]  Conducting many, many doing things, outrageous things.
[01:07:44.364 --> 01:07:46.386]  Another kind of American success story.
[01:07:47.327 --> 01:07:52.912]  So, so Elon, you know, he is, as I said, Tesla stocks been a huge winner and he's sitting on the Tesla stock.
[01:07:52.952 --> 01:07:55.775]  He's worth hundreds of millions, billions of dollars.
[01:07:56.375 --> 01:08:06.784]  And so he, he saw a guy like Michael Saylor, who runs MicroStrategy, another tech company who did his due diligence, did his homework, started buying
[01:08:08.434 --> 01:08:12.657]  Billions of dollars of the Bitcoin and he rocketed to the front of the business news.
[01:08:13.157 --> 01:08:16.160]  Like suddenly people weren't paying attention to Elon so much.
[01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:20.243]  They were focused on this new guy, Michael Saylor at MicroStrategy.
[01:08:20.483 --> 01:08:24.586]  So I think there's a little jealousy at work here where he's like, oh, yeah, I'll show that guy.
[01:08:25.067 --> 01:08:28.209]  So then, you know, he started buying Bitcoin, then he's selling Bitcoin.
[01:08:28.730 --> 01:08:35.595]  And it's I saw a tweet today, Alex, with Jack Dorsey is tweeting to Elon that they're going to meet on July 21st.
[01:08:36.932 --> 01:08:43.013]  And Jack's going to help to talk Elon, you know, down from his insanity, essentially.
[01:08:43.114 --> 01:08:44.854]  He said, Elon, we need to have a talk.
[01:08:45.174 --> 01:08:46.174]  You need to talk you down.
[01:08:46.214 --> 01:08:49.575]  It's like an intervention, you know, with alcoholics.
[01:08:49.595 --> 01:08:51.295]  Jack Dorsey's for Bitcoin, right?
[01:08:52.236 --> 01:08:58.737]  Jack Dorsey is definitely one of the biggest guys in Bitcoin, you know, Cash App, which is part of Square.
[01:08:59.277 --> 01:09:00.158]  That's his company.
[01:09:00.418 --> 01:09:05.659]  Does hundreds of millions of dollars every quarter in revenue tied to Bitcoin.
[01:09:06.345 --> 01:09:08.166]  He's got Bitcoin on the balance sheet.
[01:09:08.226 --> 01:09:12.968]  He's recently said that if he had to do it all over again, he would just focus exclusively on Bitcoin.
[01:09:13.508 --> 01:09:16.750]  So he's, you know, maintained his sanity.
[01:09:17.050 --> 01:09:26.314]  And now he's trying to do like you would see with an alcoholic, with Elon, who's gone insane, who's become drunk on Bitcoin and altcoins and Dogecoin.
[01:09:26.594 --> 01:09:31.416]  They're trying to get him into, let's say, I'm sorry, an altcoin anonymous meeting.
[01:09:31.903 --> 01:09:37.305]  They're getting him from a Dogecoin anonymous meeting to try to sober Elon up.
[01:09:37.405 --> 01:09:39.086]  He desperately needs to sober up.
[01:09:39.546 --> 01:09:41.147]  So let's talk about Bitcoin.
[01:09:41.947 --> 01:09:43.747]  You told me 10 years ago get in and I didn't.
[01:09:43.767 --> 01:09:46.469]  You told me three years ago get in and it tripled that time.
[01:09:47.029 --> 01:09:49.590]  It went up, it went down, but now it's kind of flattened out.
[01:09:50.050 --> 01:09:54.952]  And if you look at the curve, it looks like it's about to go back up if the curve or if the trend continues.
[01:09:55.072 --> 01:09:55.972]  Is that an accurate statement?
[01:09:56.952 --> 01:09:57.132]  Sure.
[01:09:58.743 --> 01:09:59.524]  And I hope we do.
[01:09:59.624 --> 01:10:01.786]  We're going to mention my July 8th event, I hope.
[01:10:02.487 --> 01:10:03.388]  Yes, don't worry.
[01:10:03.588 --> 01:10:04.789]  Your event's going to be sold out.
[01:10:04.889 --> 01:10:05.630]  It's already sold out.
[01:10:07.131 --> 01:10:08.353]  Well, yeah, I like to talk about it.
[01:10:08.373 --> 01:10:08.893]  There's a few tickets left.
[01:10:08.913 --> 01:10:09.954]  Well, I've mentioned it a hundred times.
[01:10:09.974 --> 01:10:11.356]  You're coming to Austin July 8th.
[01:10:12.156 --> 01:10:13.378]  Yeah, yeah, July 8th.
[01:10:13.418 --> 01:10:13.898]  That's it.
[01:10:13.918 --> 01:10:14.959]  Tickets still available.
[01:10:15.019 --> 01:10:16.160]  It's Max and Stacey.
[01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:17.702]  We're going to be at the Spider House.
[01:10:18.302 --> 01:10:19.263]  It's going to be a party.
[01:10:19.464 --> 01:10:20.345]  We've got Spider...
[01:10:21.347 --> 01:10:23.789]  Sticky Buds is flying in to be the DJ.
[01:10:24.050 --> 01:10:25.411]  We got excellent barbecue.
[01:10:25.871 --> 01:10:31.216]  Max is gonna be great, but I mean you're not it's got to be sold out now There's a few tickets.
[01:10:31.296 --> 01:10:33.198]  I mean the tickets are now 200 bucks apiece.
[01:10:33.278 --> 01:10:40.925]  So, you know, I sold out all the less expensive tickets I've got a few left but You know, it's a party atmosphere.
[01:10:40.945 --> 01:10:41.585]  It'll be a party.
[01:10:42.206 --> 01:10:43.867]  So getting back to
[01:10:44.867 --> 01:10:48.288]  The question at hand, which is, um, what exactly?
[01:10:48.408 --> 01:10:49.328]  Repeat, please.
[01:10:49.628 --> 01:10:54.269]  No, I mean, my question is, where do you really gut level think Bitcoin's going?
[01:10:54.709 --> 01:10:57.450]  Inflation, just all this big economic stuff happening.
[01:10:58.590 --> 01:10:58.810]  Right.
[01:10:58.930 --> 01:11:04.591]  So here's my short and dirty lesson about Bitcoin.
[01:11:04.671 --> 01:11:08.292]  You know, the price is just one of three data points.
[01:11:08.352 --> 01:11:12.172]  It's price, difficulty adjustment, hash rate.
[01:11:12.853 --> 01:11:13.153]  Okay.
[01:11:13.193 --> 01:11:13.973]  What am I talking about?
[01:11:14.433 --> 01:11:14.673]  Well,
[01:11:15.626 --> 01:11:18.587]  The hash rate is how much computer power is being thrown at this network.
[01:11:19.828 --> 01:11:23.590]  And you see the trend for 10 years, it's enormous.
[01:11:23.710 --> 01:11:28.632]  It's the biggest computer network ever created in the history of the universe by a factor, by a huge factor.
[01:11:29.152 --> 01:11:36.596]  And you see what's happening like a country like El Salvador, they're actually going to use their volcanoes to start mining Bitcoin.
[01:11:37.016 --> 01:11:42.398]  So that hash power, that computational power is growing remarkably and it's eating up.
[01:11:42.778 --> 01:11:43.999]  Here's another data point.
[01:11:44.966 --> 01:11:56.361]  Back in 1997, the internet had about 150 million users and it was still, you know, like Paul Krugman at the New York Times who was questioning whether or not the internet was a fad or not.
[01:11:56.381 --> 01:11:58.003]  You're saying it was a fax machine.
[01:11:58.871 --> 01:11:59.051]  Yeah.
[01:11:59.612 --> 01:11:59.912]  Okay.
[01:12:00.032 --> 01:12:03.795]  And right at that moment, it then, it took off that hockey stick moment.
[01:12:04.235 --> 01:12:10.760]  And you know, the internet's now... So we know when Paul Krugman says something's a failure, that's the magic sign of success.
[01:12:11.380 --> 01:12:11.561]  Right.
[01:12:11.601 --> 01:12:15.704]  So here, Bitcoin has similarly has about 150 million users right now.
[01:12:16.785 --> 01:12:19.146]  And so, and Paul Krugman has come out against it.
[01:12:19.707 --> 01:12:20.808]  So we're at the same moment.
[01:12:20.868 --> 01:12:24.030]  Now, the next 12 months, you're going to see it jump to 2 to 3 billion users.
[01:12:25.410 --> 01:12:27.751]  So the price is going to go to four or five hundred thousand.
[01:12:27.851 --> 01:12:30.072]  Does Paul Krugman realize what a loser he is?
[01:12:31.372 --> 01:12:43.357]  Well, his job is to propagandize what the Fed is doing and to make it seem normal that the country is committing, is euthanizing itself by printing.
[01:12:43.417 --> 01:12:44.438]  So what about Africa?
[01:12:44.478 --> 01:12:46.799]  You were telling me an African country is about to adopt Bitcoin.
[01:12:47.679 --> 01:12:47.839]  Right.
[01:12:47.899 --> 01:12:52.161]  So, OK, we have El Salvador is already now declared Bitcoin legal tender.
[01:12:52.979 --> 01:12:55.861]  Paraguay is now introducing legislation.
[01:12:56.201 --> 01:13:00.283]  Six more countries in Central and South America are moving forward.
[01:13:00.464 --> 01:13:02.525]  So that entire region is going to become Bitcoin.
[01:13:03.565 --> 01:13:07.308]  Then you move over to Africa and you have Nigeria is already racing ahead.
[01:13:07.428 --> 01:13:13.912]  Kenya, Mozambique and a few others are already now introducing legislation to make Bitcoin legal tender.
[01:13:14.092 --> 01:13:17.994]  Because it's a way for all these countries to outsource their monetary policy
[01:13:18.513 --> 01:13:21.594]  To an uncorruptible third party that they don't have to worry about.
[01:13:21.874 --> 01:13:23.514]  In the U.S., all the time is wasted.
[01:13:23.554 --> 01:13:27.515]  I mean, every quarter we hear about the Fed and they're saying, well, they might raise rates, they might lower rates.
[01:13:27.595 --> 01:13:29.415]  And it's all political and it's all theater.
[01:13:29.475 --> 01:13:34.636]  It's all driven by the interests of big money.
[01:13:34.916 --> 01:13:36.516]  And the result is catastrophic.
[01:13:36.836 --> 01:13:45.358]  So why not just eliminate the central bank policymaking and just create one set of monetary policies that can be used and forget about it?
[01:13:45.694 --> 01:13:47.715]  You don't need to think about your monetary policy.
[01:13:47.735 --> 01:13:50.216]  You know exactly what it is for the next hundred years.
[01:13:50.636 --> 01:13:53.637]  And that frees up government to do stuff that's more productive.
[01:13:53.878 --> 01:13:55.278]  Sure, so let's pull back for a minute.
[01:13:56.759 --> 01:14:03.522]  I got asked when I was on Andrew Schultz's podcast, I guess on Monday in New York, why do I support Bitcoin?
[01:14:03.562 --> 01:14:05.342]  I said, well, I like a new independent currency.
[01:14:05.382 --> 01:14:07.003]  I like to have something outside of government.
[01:14:07.483 --> 01:14:09.984]  As long as the technology works, I just want alternate currencies.
[01:14:10.725 --> 01:14:13.446]  Why would you define why Bitcoin is good?
[01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:18.121]  Because it satisfies a primal need for perfect money.
[01:14:19.942 --> 01:14:29.005]  We as humans have a need to trade, to use language, to move around and be social.
[01:14:29.885 --> 01:14:34.107]  The history of money is the history of civilization, the history of humanity.
[01:14:35.307 --> 01:14:38.148]  And we've always searched for the perfect money.
[01:14:38.548 --> 01:14:41.329]  We use beads, we use shells, we use all different things.
[01:14:41.649 --> 01:14:43.210]  Gold for 3,000 years.
[01:14:44.656 --> 01:14:51.878]  was really the best money available because it was durable, portable, divisible, and scarce.
[01:14:52.999 --> 01:15:03.762]  And then when Bitcoin came around, it said, okay, we'll take all those qualities of gold and now we're going to make it possible for you to send it like an email, which you can't do with gold.
[01:15:04.882 --> 01:15:09.944]  So, and we're going to do this at a time in human history where billions of people have cell phones.
[01:15:11.064 --> 01:15:13.225]  And we put those together and you have digital gold.
[01:15:13.979 --> 01:15:15.280]  And why is it so important?
[01:15:15.300 --> 01:15:21.504]  Because it still satisfies that basic human need to trade and to interact with other humans.
[01:15:21.784 --> 01:15:25.446]  And you need a medium of exchange that's not controlled by a corrupt government.
[01:15:25.827 --> 01:15:29.069]  And so Bitcoin separates money from government.
[01:15:29.109 --> 01:15:30.830]  There is nobody running Bitcoin.
[01:15:30.870 --> 01:15:31.791]  It runs itself.
[01:15:32.631 --> 01:15:34.132]  And that's what the magic of it is.
[01:15:34.192 --> 01:15:38.975]  The 20 year search for perfect money ended in 2009 with Bitcoin.
[01:15:39.375 --> 01:15:40.236]  It's perfect money.
[01:15:41.084 --> 01:15:46.766]  In terms of satisfying human need to interact and have a medium of exchange and a store of value.
[01:15:47.206 --> 01:15:51.628]  And you know, you look at these videos in El Salvador, people that 70% of the country is unbanked.
[01:15:52.669 --> 01:15:58.691]  But the second they sign up to Lightning Strike, which is an app on their phone now in
[01:15:59.386 --> 01:16:03.209]  El Salvador, they have a bank and they can transact and they can save money.
[01:16:04.970 --> 01:16:13.956]  What's the paradox between Australia, the UK, the USA, we're going to have a new medical ID or medical passport and a new digital wallet.
[01:16:13.976 --> 01:16:23.663]  So they're definitely know this is coming, which shows the power of Bitcoin and other cryptos is that they're trying to make us under a medical tyranny, adopt this new digital wallet.
[01:16:24.123 --> 01:16:24.904]  Give me your view on that.
[01:16:26.285 --> 01:16:26.465]  Right.
[01:16:26.485 --> 01:16:27.926]  So you have, first of all,
[01:16:28.809 --> 01:16:34.311]  Any state digital wallet or digital coin would be a replication of the system as it is now.
[01:16:34.511 --> 01:16:37.112]  So you just, we already have digital money.
[01:16:37.452 --> 01:16:40.153]  Most of the money from the state is quote unquote digital.
[01:16:40.333 --> 01:16:47.015]  What's different about Bitcoin is that my money, my digital money is protected by a wall of encryption.
[01:16:47.616 --> 01:16:48.556]  That's unhackable.
[01:16:48.776 --> 01:16:55.779]  As I mentioned before, it's, you had 170 quintillion calculations per second, the largest network ever in history of the world.
[01:16:55.919 --> 01:16:56.979]  That's my firewall.
[01:16:57.369 --> 01:17:03.051]  Between my wealth, which is on my key, on my wallet, in my possession, and the state.
[01:17:03.532 --> 01:17:04.592]  The state cannot hack it.
[01:17:04.852 --> 01:17:06.073]  The state cannot penetrate it.
[01:17:06.233 --> 01:17:07.253]  It's unpenetrable.
[01:17:07.733 --> 01:17:16.437]  No state, no group of states, no collective of computers can hack the SHA-256 encryption technology at the base of the Bitcoin protocol.
[01:17:16.877 --> 01:17:23.620]  It can't happen because they don't have, for many, many reasons, but you're essentially separating yourself from the state.
[01:17:24.025 --> 01:17:26.347]  And this is only possible with Bitcoin.
[01:17:26.987 --> 01:17:28.629]  Okay, so that's the answer number one.
[01:17:29.870 --> 01:17:43.681]  So to get back to your point about other state currencies and forcing people to have digital wallets, they will do that, but it doesn't change the fact that people are still going to opt out of the state and say, I've got my currency.
[01:17:44.021 --> 01:17:47.284]  So then you say, okay, well, what about if the state bans it?
[01:17:47.824 --> 01:17:51.487]  And the answer there is that states do ban it.
[01:17:52.273 --> 01:17:59.034]  It's, but it's impossible to kill it because just like it's impossible to kill P2P file sharing on intellectual property.
[01:17:59.454 --> 01:18:02.115]  You know, the music industry tried to kill P2P file sharing.
[01:18:02.135 --> 01:18:02.395]  I get it.
[01:18:02.435 --> 01:18:04.415]  You're saying human free will in action.
[01:18:04.995 --> 01:18:07.096]  Once a market is created, there's no getting rid of it.
[01:18:08.896 --> 01:18:19.018]  Basically, it satisfies the human need in a more perfect way that resonates with us and the community around it gets stronger.
[01:18:20.149 --> 01:18:22.410]  And that's an incredible force to reckon with.
[01:18:22.610 --> 01:18:23.750]  Let me ask you this then.
[01:18:24.290 --> 01:18:29.232]  You said a month ago when Bitcoin was going down, you thought it would go back up.
[01:18:29.292 --> 01:18:30.152]  It's starting to do it now.
[01:18:30.912 --> 01:18:32.933]  How high does it go in the year 2021?
[01:18:35.473 --> 01:18:39.455]  Well, you know, first of all, you know, think of the bigger picture here.
[01:18:39.535 --> 01:18:45.076]  So it is competing with gold and gold's worth about, let's call it $10 trillion.
[01:18:45.896 --> 01:18:47.577]  Bitcoin's worth just under $1 trillion.
[01:18:48.385 --> 01:19:00.530]  So a 10X move from here, from let's call it, you know, 34,000 to 340,000, I think is an easy to see that happening in the next 12 to 24 months.
[01:19:02.111 --> 01:19:16.017]  Going out further, if it's successful in disrupting the global banking, as I believe it is, then it can start to attack the bond market, the global bond market, which is worth $200 trillion.
[01:19:18.921 --> 01:19:21.042]  Okay, so then it starts to eat away at that.
[01:19:21.182 --> 01:19:29.748]  So then, you know, to honor John McAfee for a moment, he was probably the first to predict Bitcoin hitting a million dollars a coin.
[01:19:31.029 --> 01:19:38.255]  So it would be a million dollars a coin, it will be a million dollars a coin, as it begins to eat into the global bond market.
[01:19:39.215 --> 01:19:44.159]  When that happens, it's, you know, you start to, it becomes less precise.
[01:19:44.579 --> 01:19:45.480]  But if you look at the
[01:19:46.314 --> 01:19:52.759]  What's been going on for 10 years since we first started talking about it at $1, it's been compounding at an annual rate of 200%.
[01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:56.301]  It's the best performing asset in the history of the world.
[01:19:56.661 --> 01:20:02.706]  There's no reason to think it won't continue to compound at between, you know, close to that 200% a year number.
[01:20:03.066 --> 01:20:06.188]  So you just end up with these much, much higher prices.
[01:20:06.428 --> 01:20:10.551]  The fiat money world cannot defend itself against Bitcoin.
[01:20:10.811 --> 01:20:14.254]  The reason it is $35,000 right now is because it's in
[01:20:14.622 --> 01:20:21.344]  These other fiat money like the US dollar are already in a hyperinflationary collapse against Bitcoin right now.
[01:20:22.064 --> 01:20:24.645]  That's what the price is telling us today.
[01:20:25.185 --> 01:20:33.888]  And now if you see nation states adopting it as legal tender, like in El Salvador, they're signing up 20,000 people a day on the lightning.
[01:20:34.733 --> 01:20:35.614]  Strike app.
[01:20:35.674 --> 01:20:40.237]  That means that the entire country will be on Bitcoin standard in less than a year.
[01:20:40.797 --> 01:20:41.838]  That's an entire country.
[01:20:41.878 --> 01:20:43.079]  You said that six months ago.
[01:20:43.159 --> 01:20:47.441]  You said once countries start to adopt, it's going to be basically a domino effect.
[01:20:48.362 --> 01:20:51.984]  Yeah, because just, you know, review this a bit for a bit here.
[01:20:52.525 --> 01:20:56.607]  A, it satisfies that primal need in a way that's never been satisfied before.
[01:20:56.807 --> 01:21:03.552]  You know, humans have a lust for life, you know, to quote Iggy Pop, you know, and part of that lust for life
[01:21:04.911 --> 01:21:08.654]  There's a sexual quest, if you will.
[01:21:09.034 --> 01:21:11.796]  The sex is a big motivating factor in life.
[01:21:12.096 --> 01:21:20.522]  Food, shelter, and having the ability to exchange with other human beings using money.
[01:21:20.542 --> 01:21:23.184]  Yeah, the medium between sex, commerce, all of it's money.
[01:21:24.685 --> 01:21:29.308]  Yeah, the money is part of our DNA in terms of it's a primal need.
[01:21:30.314 --> 01:21:32.616]  And how to satisfy that need.
[01:21:32.736 --> 01:21:34.918]  And we're always looking to satisfy our needs.
[01:21:35.118 --> 01:21:38.761]  You know, we're always looking for food, we're looking for shelter, we're looking for sex.
[01:21:38.801 --> 01:21:41.963]  So you're saying Bitcoin satisfies a major drive state?
[01:21:43.004 --> 01:21:43.484]  Completely.
[01:21:43.665 --> 01:21:45.126]  In a more perfect way.
[01:21:45.826 --> 01:21:47.247]  I mean, gold doesn't do it.
[01:21:47.888 --> 01:21:49.569]  And fiat money certainly doesn't do it.
[01:21:49.629 --> 01:21:54.993]  You know, fiat money is like one of those vinyl sex dolls that you get for $9.99 at Times Square.
[01:21:55.454 --> 01:21:58.216]  You know, it's not going to satisfy you, Alex.
[01:21:58.934 --> 01:22:04.595]  Uh, gold would be like, you know, I don't want to get too gross with this comparison, but you see where I'm going with this.
[01:22:05.096 --> 01:22:08.296]  So, you know, Bitcoin... Gold would be like an animal versus a roll on it.
[01:22:09.117 --> 01:22:11.357]  Well, let's use, uh, you know, food instead.
[01:22:11.457 --> 01:22:26.501]  So, so fiat money is, you know, fiat food, you know, like a McDonald's food is, you know, they just pump it out by the trillions and it, it, it lacks nutrients and you don't really feel satisfied after you eat that food and you, and you end up eating a lot more food and that's how you get fat.
[01:22:27.076 --> 01:22:31.181]  All right, so the gold would be, let's say, a home-cooked meal.
[01:22:31.701 --> 01:22:40.611]  And then, you know, Bitcoin would be Alain Ducasse, you know, four Michelin star chef in Paris whipping you up.
[01:22:41.149 --> 01:22:51.395]  A meal, and you just have a food orgasm looking at it, because it satisfies something so deep and so primal in your soul, it makes you more human.
[01:22:51.856 --> 01:22:57.019]  Well, that's even what the big host on Sky TV in Australia said.
[01:22:57.039 --> 01:22:58.439]  He said it'll cut out the crime.
[01:22:58.900 --> 01:23:00.020]  How does it cut out the fraud?
[01:23:00.060 --> 01:23:01.201]  I guess you can't manipulate it?
[01:23:01.842 --> 01:23:03.943]  You can't inflate it?
[01:23:04.623 --> 01:23:07.125]  Well, it disincentivizes fraud.
[01:23:07.305 --> 01:23:09.106]  It disincentivizes violence.
[01:23:09.577 --> 01:23:11.398]  And it's a good point, let me get into it.
[01:23:11.758 --> 01:23:23.983]  Because it's unconfiscatable, because your wealth is behind this impregnable encrypted wall, it disincentivizes coercion and violence.
[01:23:25.183 --> 01:23:34.187]  Because once it's understood generally that there's no way you can get my private key, you can't confiscate it.
[01:23:34.207 --> 01:23:35.568]  The government can't take it.
[01:23:35.868 --> 01:23:38.529]  The government's always confiscating wealth, they confiscate gold.
[01:23:39.444 --> 01:23:40.885]  Um, and this is a big problem.
[01:23:40.925 --> 01:23:41.385]  The U.S.
[01:23:41.425 --> 01:23:45.407]  goes into other countries and it confiscates their oil, you know, during the Iraq war.
[01:23:45.867 --> 01:23:46.007]  Right?
[01:23:46.047 --> 01:23:49.168]  So this, this problem of violence is huge in our, in our species.
[01:23:50.069 --> 01:23:58.932]  And with Bitcoin, because it's unconfiscatable, eventually people have to, are going to figure out that the only way they can get some Bitcoin is to offer me something that I want to trade Bitcoin for.
[01:23:59.392 --> 01:24:01.113]  They know that, okay, they'll cook me a meal.
[01:24:01.133 --> 01:24:05.795]  They'll service oriented instead of conquest oriented.
[01:24:07.516 --> 01:24:07.696]  Yeah.
[01:24:08.117 --> 01:24:08.697]  That's right.
[01:24:09.038 --> 01:24:17.685]  It disincentivizes violence and it monetizes peace in that sense, because everyone is a sovereign individual.
[01:24:18.325 --> 01:24:24.050]  You know, you, you know, I've had an exciting life in the last 10 years.
[01:24:24.670 --> 01:24:33.097]  And you, at some point, if you had put X number of bitcoins into an unconfiscated wallet that's protected with the shield of encryption,
[01:24:33.868 --> 01:24:37.931]  You know, you wouldn't, you would be in a better position today, perhaps.
[01:24:38.291 --> 01:24:40.273]  And this is so for everyone out there.
[01:24:40.373 --> 01:24:49.560]  You know, everyone in the world has, everyone is now concerned about surveillance and they're concerned about the state and taxes are going up.
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:59.027]  At some point, Alex, if in fact these taxes go up as they're talking about it, then Max and Stacey will leave.
[01:24:59.647 --> 01:25:00.528]  We'll go to a country
[01:25:01.434 --> 01:25:02.074]  That wants us.
[01:25:02.354 --> 01:25:08.836]  I mean, I'm not going to stay in a country that doesn't want me and wants to steal my money through taxes.
[01:25:09.237 --> 01:25:13.338]  And I can, all of my wealth, can I put into a seed phrase in my head?
[01:25:13.358 --> 01:25:15.559]  I can walk naked through the airport.
[01:25:16.219 --> 01:25:17.659]  I can show up anywhere in the world.
[01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:19.200]  And I have all my wealth.
[01:25:19.995 --> 01:25:23.737]  And I can be welcomed as somebody who's contributing to that?
[01:25:23.757 --> 01:25:25.378]  Well, that's what's exciting about Bitcoin.
[01:25:25.699 --> 01:25:28.240]  So in closing, is there any competition to Bitcoin?
[01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:34.784]  Because if it's this great protocol, this great system, why can't someone launch the same thing over again and then it builds its own value?
[01:25:34.844 --> 01:25:41.288]  Or is it the total investment of time and energy in Bitcoin that just makes it where it's like a black hole that just gets bigger?
[01:25:43.189 --> 01:25:47.292]  It achieved perfect decentralization and perfect money, and they only need to do that once.
[01:25:48.667 --> 01:25:51.909]  And it's like, you know, the virginal birth.
[01:25:52.229 --> 01:25:53.129]  You only had to do it once.
[01:25:54.630 --> 01:25:56.151]  It's the way it's structured.
[01:25:56.231 --> 01:25:57.572]  It's like, look at this, look at it this way.
[01:25:58.072 --> 01:25:59.953]  You know, Bitcoin is like a discovery.
[01:26:00.533 --> 01:26:03.815]  Like when Einstein discovered E equals MC squared.
[01:26:04.875 --> 01:26:05.976]  I mean, he didn't invent it.
[01:26:06.536 --> 01:26:07.176]  He discovered it.
[01:26:08.097 --> 01:26:12.659]  Now, does it make sense if it's E equals MC to the power of three?
[01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:15.420]  No, it doesn't.
[01:26:15.441 --> 01:26:16.261]  It doesn't work, does it?
[01:26:16.281 --> 01:26:18.422]  It only works if that one, that formula is only the way it
[01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:21.982]  The Bitcoin protocol is that formula that gives us perfect money.
[01:26:22.082 --> 01:26:23.943]  We don't need to reinvent it.
[01:26:24.143 --> 01:26:25.003]  It's here right now.
[01:26:25.644 --> 01:26:27.625]  It's here right now and it's changing everyone's life.
[01:26:27.825 --> 01:26:31.267]  So why waste time trying to reinvent what's perfect?
[01:26:31.927 --> 01:26:32.528]  It's perfect.
[01:26:32.948 --> 01:26:34.369]  It took 20 years of development.
[01:26:34.789 --> 01:26:36.470]  We should feel blessed.
[01:26:37.010 --> 01:26:43.834]  Listen, I agree with you that Bitcoin compared to everything else is amazing, but obviously people are always going to create something alternative.
[01:26:44.194 --> 01:26:45.295]  That's just the way the universe works.
[01:26:45.834 --> 01:26:46.334]  Well, okay.
[01:26:46.354 --> 01:26:51.355]  So for 10 years, they've been, others have tried to create imitators and none have succeeded.
[01:26:51.395 --> 01:26:54.216]  They've all failed because they've all failed miserably.
[01:26:54.556 --> 01:26:59.597]  Bitcoin is over 90% of all the, 95% of the computer power goes to Bitcoin.
[01:26:59.657 --> 01:27:02.277]  States are making Bitcoin legal tender, nothing else.
[01:27:02.918 --> 01:27:09.539]  And I say this, the only reason for these other altcoins to exist is to try and steal your Bitcoin.
[01:27:10.029 --> 01:27:12.450]  And that happens over and over and over again.
[01:27:12.510 --> 01:27:18.932]  They're like, when you go to, you see people selling fake Rolexes on the street or fake Gucci bags.
[01:27:19.272 --> 01:27:21.993]  They're just counterfeit, fake nonsense.
[01:27:22.013 --> 01:27:23.354]  You trying to steal your money.
[01:27:23.794 --> 01:27:24.834]  They're just scams.
[01:27:24.955 --> 01:27:28.736]  Every single one has a foundation or somebody at the center of it.
[01:27:29.236 --> 01:27:30.457]  So they're centralized.
[01:27:31.057 --> 01:27:33.398]  That's your tip off right there that there's a problem.
[01:27:33.978 --> 01:27:36.819]  Number two, virtually every single one disappears.
[01:27:37.589 --> 01:27:41.031]  Within a couple of years, if not sooner, that's another tip off.
[01:27:42.051 --> 01:27:44.473]  And it goes on and on.
[01:27:44.573 --> 01:27:48.615]  I mean, there's always going to be somebody coming along with some new whiz bang.
[01:27:48.695 --> 01:27:49.755]  Oh, this is the new thing.
[01:27:50.756 --> 01:27:56.819]  So finally, when December rolls into January 2022, where do you think Bitcoin is?
[01:27:56.859 --> 01:27:59.020]  I still have my 2021 prediction is still in play. 220,000.
[01:28:06.018 --> 01:28:06.438]  This year.
[01:28:06.939 --> 01:28:10.301]  That's still in play.
[01:28:10.521 --> 01:28:12.162]  We're landing in Austin on the 6th.
[01:28:12.642 --> 01:28:15.664]  I think I'm going to be on your show live in the studio on the 7th.
[01:28:18.446 --> 01:28:19.286]  Hello again.
[01:28:19.386 --> 01:28:19.947]  Max, I'm here.
[01:28:19.987 --> 01:28:21.167]  I'm just getting good at listening.
[01:28:21.187 --> 01:28:23.489]  Have you not noticed that?
[01:28:23.509 --> 01:28:26.791]  You've been talking for 15 minutes and I've barely interrupted.
[01:28:27.911 --> 01:28:28.772]  No, it's fantastic.
[01:28:28.852 --> 01:28:32.214]  I just want to reiterate that, you know, I'll be there the 6th.
[01:28:32.354 --> 01:28:33.355]  We're going to hang out the 7th.
[01:28:34.495 --> 01:28:40.997]  And, uh, you know, you and your wife are invited to come on the 8th, uh, to just be, you know, come and have a party.
[01:28:41.077 --> 01:28:42.377]  You know, you don't have to do anything.
[01:28:42.417 --> 01:28:44.018]  Just come down and party with us.
[01:28:44.038 --> 01:28:45.238]  What's in those orange pills?
[01:28:46.398 --> 01:28:47.799]  Yeah, we got lots of orange pills.
[01:28:48.059 --> 01:28:49.699]  More orange pills than you can shake a stick at.
[01:28:49.719 --> 01:28:50.820]  What's in them?
[01:28:51.660 --> 01:28:52.340]  We got a lot of them.
[01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:53.920]  We got a whole bag of them right here somewhere.
[01:28:54.301 --> 01:28:55.101]  They got lots of them.
[01:28:55.261 --> 01:28:56.661]  Lots of orange pills, Alex!
[01:28:57.001 --> 01:28:58.022]  I'm asking, what's in them?
[01:28:59.262 --> 01:28:59.502]  Love.
[01:29:00.732 --> 01:29:01.212]  Love.
[01:29:01.312 --> 01:29:02.672]  Well, that's a pill I'll take.
[01:29:03.132 --> 01:29:10.834]  So, the best place to visit you is swanbitcoin.com forward slash Alex, which is a sponsor of ours.
[01:29:10.854 --> 01:29:11.754]  Great place to sign up.

[01:29:14.194 --> 01:29:15.935]  swanbitcoin.com forward slash Alex.
[01:29:16.435 --> 01:29:17.875]  Thank you so much, Max Keiser.
[01:29:17.915 --> 01:29:20.015]  I really appreciate you being on with us.
[01:29:20.035 --> 01:29:20.255]  All right.
[01:29:20.295 --> 01:29:21.296]  See you in a couple of weeks, buddy.
[01:29:21.736 --> 01:29:22.296]  Bye-bye, Max.
[01:29:22.796 --> 01:29:28.677]  Well, that was a powerful, almost hour-long interview with Max Keiser, and I did a good job.
[01:29:28.737 --> 01:29:29.117]  I shot it.
[01:29:29.137 --> 01:29:29.757]  Oh, that's all right.
[01:29:30.540 --> 01:29:31.440]  Yep, there goes Max.
[01:29:32.181 --> 01:29:33.882]  And so we had a good discussion with Max.
[01:29:34.262 --> 01:29:34.742]  Stay with us.
[01:29:36.043 --> 01:29:39.804]  It's hard to believe that July 4th, 2021 is almost here.
[01:29:41.805 --> 01:29:45.127]  It's hard to believe that our country is literally fighting for its life.
[01:29:46.247 --> 01:29:50.909]  But for all the negative things that are happening, a lot of really positive things are happening as well.
[01:29:51.550 --> 01:29:56.592]  It's been said by many historian that things have to get really, really bad before they get better.
[01:29:57.052 --> 01:29:58.773]  And we're now reaching that point of no return.
[01:29:59.359 --> 01:30:00.046]  A tipping point.
[01:30:00.207 --> 01:30:01.015]  Global government.
[01:30:01.755 --> 01:30:05.197]  And it's planetary depopulation plan is now out in the open.
[01:30:05.657 --> 01:30:08.378]  And people realize the time for fun and games is over.
[01:30:08.398 --> 01:30:14.741]  That's why I wanted to report to you, the listeners and viewers of this transmission, the good news today, as well as the bad news.
[01:30:15.402 --> 01:30:26.947]  I've been contacted in the last two weeks by some of the top people in international media and national news as well, as well as some of the folks at the highest levels of government, corporations, the private sector, you name it.
[01:30:27.367 --> 01:30:28.848]  And they've all told me the same thing.
[01:30:29.388 --> 01:30:30.149]  Alex, keep it up!
[01:30:31.138 --> 01:30:35.921]  You've been vindicated and we're having a major breakthrough thanks to your work.
[01:30:36.661 --> 01:30:40.804]  Well I wanted the listeners to know that it's you that have allowed this to happen.
[01:30:41.324 --> 01:30:53.752]  You have been just as important as I've been and so at least now world government is attacking but we have a chance to defeat it because we've worked together for decades to warn people about what was coming.
[01:30:54.112 --> 01:30:54.992]  It sounded insane.
[01:30:55.072 --> 01:30:55.793]  It sounded crazy.
[01:30:55.833 --> 01:30:56.593]  It sounded dangerous.
[01:30:56.874 --> 01:30:57.654]  It sounded made up.
[01:30:57.994 --> 01:30:59.015]  It sounded like a horror movie.
[01:30:59.355 --> 01:31:00.696]  A science fiction dystopia.
[01:31:01.311 --> 01:31:01.853]  But it was real.
[01:31:02.556 --> 01:31:04.543]  And so we knew it was real and we knew they were going to pull this.
[01:31:05.342 --> 01:31:10.844]  And so now that they've actually launched their operation, people aren't being completely caught flat-footed.
[01:31:11.244 --> 01:31:12.965]  So that's the real power of InfoWars.
[01:31:13.525 --> 01:31:15.886]  That's why it's more important than ever to help keep it on air.
[01:31:16.346 --> 01:31:24.429]  We have a July 4th special running right now with store-wide free shipping, double Patriot points is back as well, and up to 60% off best-selling items like X3.
[01:31:24.929 --> 01:31:34.673]  So please, take action today and help keep InfoWars on the air now more than ever, because our mission is proving that it's incredibly accurate and has been part of the human destiny for liberty and freedom.
[01:31:35.914 --> 01:31:50.480]  And in closing tonight on this Saturday transmission, I was watching American Journal with Harrison Smith yesterday on Friday morning, and he just had a very powerful analysis of General Milley's treason.
[01:31:51.260 --> 01:31:53.501]  And now they're trying to create a race war in this country.
[01:31:53.561 --> 01:31:59.684]  So here in conclusion is Harrison Smith and the General Milley breakdown.
[01:31:59.704 --> 01:32:03.886]  This is important to decry these globalists that have sold the country out.
[01:32:03.926 --> 01:32:04.746]  It's very important to.
[01:32:05.558 --> 01:32:09.260]  Expose them and point out they're non-Americans, that they're globalists.
[01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:18.165]  And it's very important to understand, without you word-of-mouth supporting this broadcast, spreading the word, and financially supporting us, we won't be here.
[01:32:18.585 --> 01:32:19.646]  So I'm not bitching at you.
[01:32:20.046 --> 01:32:26.290]  I'm thanking you for your support and encouraging you to take advantage of the big July 4th sale.
[01:32:26.630 --> 01:32:28.291]  July 4th Super Sale starts now.

[01:32:53.659 --> 01:32:55.060]  Thanks for keeping us on air.
[01:32:55.480 --> 01:32:59.801]  Whatever you do, please take action today, because without you, we won't be able to stay on air.
[01:33:00.222 --> 01:33:07.444]  So again, InfoWarsTore.com, and then we will take you to the important Harrison Smith transmission from this Friday.
[01:33:07.464 --> 01:33:11.625]  And then hopefully, I'll be back, it's all Lord willing, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:33:12.205 --> 01:33:13.026]  Sunday night.
[01:33:14.286 --> 01:33:27.309]  With a bunch of special guests we've got lined up, like Mike Lindell and others, for the Sunday broadcast, coming up here in just a few hours if you're watching us as a taped, but right now we are live Saturday night, so please stay with us.
[01:33:27.949 --> 01:33:31.829]  So this is General Milley falling for another lie of the media, right?
[01:33:32.109 --> 01:33:37.491]  And being forced to apologize, and groveling, oh I spent days agonizing over my participation in this.
[01:33:38.131 --> 01:33:39.851]  Well you fell for another lie, moron.
[01:33:41.954 --> 01:33:43.875]  Just like you're falling for the lie of white rage.
[01:33:43.915 --> 01:33:46.217]  Just like you're falling for the lie of critical race theory.
[01:33:46.617 --> 01:33:51.821]  Just like you fell for the lie of 1619 and 400 years of slavery.
[01:33:51.841 --> 01:34:00.287]  He literally says, what we're seeing is the protests not only speak of his killing, but of the centuries of injustice towards African Americans.
[01:34:00.327 --> 01:34:05.230]  What we're seeing is the long shadow of our original sin in Jamestown 401 years ago.
[01:34:05.250 --> 01:34:07.792]  A real apolitical, buddy.
[01:34:09.708 --> 01:34:11.970]  Exploring the 16, 19, 400 years of slavery.
[01:34:12.830 --> 01:34:13.471]  Blood libel.
[01:34:13.911 --> 01:34:14.291]  Slander.
[01:34:14.952 --> 01:34:23.457]  You need to defend your civilization against the onslaught of this cancer of progressivism, liberalism, and globalist brainwashing.
[01:34:23.517 --> 01:34:25.498]  This is a life or death situation.
[01:34:25.899 --> 01:34:26.999]  No messing around.
[01:34:27.019 --> 01:34:30.582]  The prescription is two doses of Infowars taken daily.
[01:34:33.348 --> 01:34:37.891]  You're listening to The American Journal with your host, Harrison Smith.
[01:34:38.332 --> 01:34:40.794]  Watch it live right now at band.video.
[01:34:40.814 --> 01:34:42.715]  All right, welcome back, folks.
[01:34:42.755 --> 01:34:44.757]  Second hour of American Journal.
[01:34:48.479 --> 01:34:51.862]  And we're about to get into some things, folks.
[01:34:55.745 --> 01:34:57.806]  Because, my God, are we in trouble.
[01:34:59.007 --> 01:35:02.350]  I mean, my God, are we in trouble.
[01:35:04.172 --> 01:35:04.613]  Uh, yeah.
[01:35:05.513 --> 01:35:17.981]  Our military has been taken over by extremists that are now using the label of extremists to try to purge anybody that actually understands or believes in the American Constitution.
[01:35:18.041 --> 01:35:21.824]  It's part of the paving the way for their coming abuses.
[01:35:23.220 --> 01:35:33.230]  Get rid of anybody who actually understands the American Constitution, understands the limitations that it imposes on the government and the freedoms that it gives to the American people.
[01:35:34.051 --> 01:35:44.041]  You want people who don't, either don't understand that or don't agree with it, because then you can violate those rights and the people following your orders will have no compunction in doing so.
[01:35:45.243 --> 01:35:46.344]  Pretty clear what's going on here.
[01:35:48.123 --> 01:35:52.885]  Our military, just like our government, has been taken over by anti-American extremists.
[01:35:54.105 --> 01:36:03.309]  It sounds wild to say, but what other conclusion are we left with when you have the people that I'm talking about openly espousing this belief?
[01:36:05.190 --> 01:36:05.850]  Truly incredible.
[01:36:05.870 --> 01:36:07.031]  Let's go to some videos here.
[01:36:08.551 --> 01:36:09.232]  We'll start with...
[01:36:10.934 --> 01:36:12.735]  General Mark Milley versus Matt Gaetz.
[01:36:12.775 --> 01:36:15.976]  Clip number seven on critical race theory.
[01:36:16.016 --> 01:36:18.837]  General Mark Milley versus Matt Gaetz on critical race theory.
[01:36:18.857 --> 01:36:19.177]  Here it is.
[01:36:20.238 --> 01:36:24.139]  How should the Department of Defense think about critical race theory?
[01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:26.920]  Could I make a comment, Secretary?
[01:36:26.940 --> 01:36:27.240]  I'm sorry.
[01:36:27.621 --> 01:36:29.401]  I'm very limited on my time, General Milley.
[01:36:29.441 --> 01:36:30.702]  Well, I just want to make a comment.
[01:36:30.822 --> 01:36:33.563]  I know, but I've asked the question to Secretary Austin.
[01:36:34.494 --> 01:36:40.937]  I don't know what the issue of critical race theory is and what the relevance here with the department.
[01:36:41.457 --> 01:36:43.778]  We do not teach critical race theory.
[01:36:43.838 --> 01:36:46.619]  We don't embrace critical race theory.
[01:36:47.039 --> 01:36:50.961]  And I think that's a spurious conversation.
[01:36:51.301 --> 01:36:59.084]  I would like to yield some of my time to General Milley because I know that he had some comments that he wanted to make when Representative Gates was talking.
[01:36:59.104 --> 01:36:59.184]  Sure.
[01:37:02.290 --> 01:37:07.339]  On the issue of critical race theory, etc., I'll obviously have to get much smarter on whatever the theory is.
[01:37:09.517 --> 01:37:17.241]  But I do think it's important, actually, for those of us in uniform to be open-minded and be widely read.
[01:37:17.461 --> 01:37:19.762]  And the United States Military Academy is a university.
[01:37:20.782 --> 01:37:24.204]  And it is important that we train and we understand.
[01:37:24.224 --> 01:37:26.565]  And I want to understand white rage.
[01:37:26.985 --> 01:37:27.426]  And I'm white.
[01:37:27.886 --> 01:37:28.846]  And I want to understand it.
[01:37:29.286 --> 01:37:37.630]  So what is it that caused thousands of people to assault this building and try to overturn the Constitution of the United States of America?
[01:37:37.670 --> 01:37:38.311]  What caused that?
[01:37:38.911 --> 01:37:39.732]  I want to find that out.
[01:37:40.032 --> 01:37:41.553]  I want to maintain an open mind here.
[01:37:41.613 --> 01:37:42.694]  And I do want to analyze it.
[01:37:42.954 --> 01:37:44.256]  It's important that we understand that.
[01:37:44.496 --> 01:37:48.299]  Because our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and guardians, they come from the American people.
[01:37:48.639 --> 01:37:53.383]  So it is important that the leaders, now and in the future, do understand it.
[01:37:53.804 --> 01:37:54.985]  I've read Mao Zedong.
[01:37:55.105 --> 01:37:56.826]  I've read Karl Marx.
[01:37:57.146 --> 01:37:58.187]  I've read Lenin.
[01:37:58.307 --> 01:37:59.528]  That doesn't make me a communist.
[01:37:59.849 --> 01:38:06.855]  So what is wrong with understanding, having some situational understanding about the country for which we are here to defend?
[01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:19.788]  And I personally find it offensive that we are accusing the United States military, our general officers, our commissioned, non-commissioned officers, of being, quote, woke or something else because we're studying some theories that are out there.
[01:38:19.948 --> 01:38:34.118]  That was started at Harvard Law School years ago and it proposed that there were laws in the United States, antebellum laws, prior to the Civil War, that led to a power differential with African-Americans that were three-quarters of a human being when this country was formed.
[01:38:34.298 --> 01:38:37.179]  And then we had a Civil War and Emancipation Proclamation to change it.
[01:38:37.379 --> 01:38:38.859]  And we brought it up to the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
[01:38:38.919 --> 01:38:40.960]  It took another hundred years to change that.
[01:38:41.460 --> 01:38:42.701]  So look it, I do want to know.
[01:38:43.361 --> 01:38:45.762]  And I respect your service and you and I are both Green Berets.
[01:38:46.042 --> 01:38:46.702]  But I want to know.
[01:38:47.462 --> 01:38:50.303]  And it matters to our military and the discipline and cohesion of this military.
[01:38:50.863 --> 01:38:52.924]  And I thank you for the opportunity to make a comment on that.
[01:38:53.104 --> 01:38:53.924]  Thank you, General.
[01:38:55.545 --> 01:38:56.685]  Wow, where to begin with that?
[01:38:58.423 --> 01:39:00.025]  I'd begin with a firing squad.
[01:39:00.105 --> 01:39:01.146]  No, I didn't say that.
[01:39:01.206 --> 01:39:01.847]  I didn't say that.
[01:39:02.467 --> 01:39:02.968]  No, no.
[01:39:03.408 --> 01:39:05.851]  Legally, I mean, you know, treason, right?
[01:39:05.971 --> 01:39:07.773]  Like, what was the punishment for treason?
[01:39:07.973 --> 01:39:10.736]  I'm just talking about legal processes here.
[01:39:11.797 --> 01:39:14.120]  Nothing out of the ordinary, of course, because
[01:39:15.848 --> 01:39:18.570]  What you just saw was obviously pure obfuscation.
[01:39:18.590 --> 01:39:25.875]  I don't understand critical race theory, but let me go on a little diatribe where I lay out its main points perfectly, as if I believe all of them.
[01:39:26.055 --> 01:39:28.817]  It's just like, okay, so you understand exactly what this is.
[01:39:28.837 --> 01:39:31.198]  You understand exactly what's going on here.
[01:39:32.359 --> 01:39:38.823]  And yeah, you do need to understand Lenin and Mao, but let's just, let's understand something.
[01:39:38.843 --> 01:39:40.505]  He said, I want to understand white rage.
[01:39:40.585 --> 01:39:43.687]  Okay, General Milley, I'll explain white rage to you right now.
[01:39:44.764 --> 01:39:48.368]  White rage is a blood libel against you and your people.
[01:39:49.449 --> 01:39:49.709]  Okay?
[01:39:50.530 --> 01:39:51.591]  You want to understand it?
[01:39:51.651 --> 01:39:55.455]  Well, we got to give a voice to the people blood libeling us.
[01:39:56.636 --> 01:40:03.103]  Yeah, you know, you just got to, you know, so let's just, let's just put this in the compartment that it belongs in.
[01:40:03.703 --> 01:40:07.868]  And let's just assume instead of critical race theory, we were talking about Holocaust denialism.
[01:40:09.548 --> 01:40:12.810]  Let's just switch those two words out and see how illuminating it is.
[01:40:13.611 --> 01:40:24.839]  Let's just ask ourselves if, like, the military of Israel would sit in front of the Knesset and go, look, you know, I think it's... I'm actually for Holocaust denialism.
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:32.465]  You know, I think it's worth it to understand and to read into, you know, these writers that say that the Holocaust didn't happen.
[01:40:32.785 --> 01:40:35.748]  I think it's worth it to understand this and look into it because
[01:40:36.428 --> 01:40:39.537]  After all, you know, this is just, like, it's absurd, right?
[01:40:39.638 --> 01:40:40.320]  It's outrageous.
[01:40:40.962 --> 01:40:41.724]  It makes no sense.
[01:40:43.083 --> 01:40:44.864]  But this is where we are now.
[01:40:45.144 --> 01:40:45.884]  This is what's happening.
[01:40:46.205 --> 01:40:48.326]  I like Drew Holden's response to this.
[01:40:48.366 --> 01:40:49.967]  He says, And that's another great point.
[01:40:50.007 --> 01:40:55.229]  So you take it a step farther, it's like, well, not only are we discussing Holocaust denialism in order to understand its points, you know, and perhaps to
[01:41:12.856 --> 01:41:19.303]  Disabuse the people who believe them, of it, to, you know, confront the misinformation with facts.
[01:41:20.905 --> 01:41:22.387]  That's not what critical race theory is, is it?
[01:41:23.047 --> 01:41:28.794]  You aren't talking about critical race theory, talking about how wrong it is, like you might discuss the writings of Lenin or Mao.
[01:41:30.415 --> 01:41:31.517]  No, it's being taught.
[01:41:32.642 --> 01:41:33.182]  It's being enforced.
[01:41:33.462 --> 01:41:37.924]  I resent, what did he say, I resent being called, being accused of the military as woke.
[01:41:38.164 --> 01:41:55.670]  Meanwhile, Secretary of Defense is just like, yeah, we are purging the military of anybody who has an icon of this, you know, Archangel Michael, anybody who has the Pepe logo, anybody who is a member of the Three Percenters, the Proud Boys, or the Oath Keepers.
[01:41:57.116 --> 01:42:02.340]  You're implementing policies that are reshaping the entire military on woke lines.
[01:42:02.840 --> 01:42:05.983]  So resent it all you want, fat moron!
[01:42:08.225 --> 01:42:08.965]  You're a tool.
[01:42:09.065 --> 01:42:14.169]  You're a useful idiot with a bunch of colored ribbons on his chest making him feel good.
[01:42:16.851 --> 01:42:20.994]  You don't need to teach the lessons of your enemies.
[01:42:22.976 --> 01:42:25.158]  You can understand them to rebut them.
[01:42:26.647 --> 01:42:27.508]  That's not what he did there.
[01:42:27.608 --> 01:42:28.488]  He recited them!
[01:42:28.929 --> 01:42:29.890]  As if he believes them!
[01:42:30.790 --> 01:42:45.342]  As if he believes that the fact that black people were considered three quarters of a human two hundred years ago somehow has an impact on today's America.
[01:42:46.663 --> 01:42:47.103]  New York Times.
[01:42:47.344 --> 01:42:51.367]  General Milley pushes back on GOP accusations of woke military.
[01:42:51.387 --> 01:42:54.890]  Let's talk about some of the other stuff that
[01:42:56.778 --> 01:42:57.939]  General Milley has been involved in.
[01:42:57.959 --> 01:42:59.580]  We'll do that in the next segment.
[01:43:00.200 --> 01:43:01.181]  You probably recognize his name.
[01:43:01.882 --> 01:43:07.485]  Because there's been some other stuff that old Milley has been involved in over the last few years.
[01:43:08.386 --> 01:43:12.269]  I think they're extremely illuminating once we go back and look at them.
[01:43:12.889 --> 01:43:14.290]  Illuminating in a number of different ways.
[01:43:14.991 --> 01:43:16.191]  Gateway Pundit has a great article.
[01:43:16.231 --> 01:43:16.812]  Lloyd Austin.
[01:43:17.312 --> 01:43:19.714]  Is Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin really this clueless?
[01:43:20.762 --> 01:43:21.442]  I'm going to answer that.
[01:43:22.442 --> 01:43:22.742]  No.
[01:43:23.323 --> 01:43:23.763]  No, no, no.
[01:43:23.823 --> 01:43:24.923]  He's lying to you.
[01:43:25.703 --> 01:43:27.383]  No, he knows exactly what he's doing.
[01:43:28.584 --> 01:43:30.344]  And this performative outrage.
[01:43:31.444 --> 01:43:33.525]  How dare you claim that we're woke?
[01:43:33.665 --> 01:43:35.885]  It's just like, who's giving you orders?
[01:43:36.005 --> 01:43:36.665]  The ADL?
[01:43:37.446 --> 01:43:43.847]  So you're taking the ADL's suggestion as to who to purge from your military.
[01:43:45.347 --> 01:43:47.828]  And you're claiming you're not woke, right?
[01:43:47.948 --> 01:43:48.348]  You're letting a
[01:43:49.795 --> 01:44:03.860]  Privately organized, privately funded, racial supremacist organization dictate to you who should and should not be in the American military and what courses are being taught at American military universities.
[01:44:04.641 --> 01:44:07.242]  An organization, by the way, compromised mostly of foreigners.
[01:44:09.503 --> 01:44:12.124]  And you're acting outraged that we would point this out?
[01:44:12.144 --> 01:44:17.846]  You're acting outraged that people actually notice what you're doing and are standing up against it?
[01:44:22.242 --> 01:44:22.562]  Treason.
[01:44:23.143 --> 01:44:24.383]  Treason, treason, treason.
[01:44:24.424 --> 01:44:24.804]  It's a coup.
[01:44:25.064 --> 01:44:27.125]  We've been taken over by un-Americans.
[01:44:36.792 --> 01:44:41.335]  General Milley says he wants to understand white rage.
[01:44:43.376 --> 01:44:49.320]  Says, quote, what is it that caused thousands of people to assault this building and try to overturn the Constitution of the United States of America?
[01:44:50.220 --> 01:44:50.701]  Let's just
[01:44:52.123 --> 01:44:52.903]  It's a short sentence.
[01:44:53.424 --> 01:44:58.705]  What is it that caused thousands of people to assault this building and try to overturn the Constitution of the United States of America?
[01:44:59.526 --> 01:45:03.287]  What is wrong with having some situational understanding of the country we're here to defend?
[01:45:04.847 --> 01:45:12.330]  Well, if your situational understanding is based off of a blatant lie, do you really have situational understanding, General?
[01:45:14.451 --> 01:45:15.371]  If you're being told
[01:45:16.741 --> 01:45:41.427]  That the reason that people peacefully protested at the Capitol on January 6th, in which nobody was armed, nobody other than a peaceful protester was murdered, in which almost no damage was even done, a couple windows broken, an envelope stolen, a desk got shoe prints on it.
[01:45:45.120 --> 01:45:53.669]  Let's just clarify just how incompetent, confused, wrong General Milley is.
[01:45:54.109 --> 01:45:54.410]  Okay?
[01:45:57.032 --> 01:45:58.794]  First of all, it wasn't thousands of people, it was millions.
[01:45:59.895 --> 01:46:01.217]  Second of all, they didn't assault the building.
[01:46:02.058 --> 01:46:02.758]  They walked through it.
[01:46:02.778 --> 01:46:05.221]  In like single file line.
[01:46:07.625 --> 01:46:10.226]  And they didn't try to overturn the Constitution of the United States of America.
[01:46:10.846 --> 01:46:13.406]  They tried to have their voices heard.
[01:46:14.166 --> 01:46:17.367]  They tried to get some sort of redress of their grievances.
[01:46:20.168 --> 01:46:28.030]  This is explicitly allowed by the First Amendment.
[01:46:28.190 --> 01:46:30.910]  I want to understand white rage and I'm white.
[01:46:32.991 --> 01:46:34.171]  Again, this is
[01:46:35.865 --> 01:46:38.566]  Like a Jew being like, look, I want to understand Holocaust denial.
[01:46:38.846 --> 01:46:39.426]  And I'm a Jew!
[01:46:39.446 --> 01:46:44.207]  It's just like... It's a blood libel!
[01:46:44.787 --> 01:46:45.367]  That's what it is!
[01:46:45.807 --> 01:46:48.608]  So... You understand it now.
[01:46:48.768 --> 01:46:49.788]  I've told you what it is now.
[01:46:49.828 --> 01:46:50.468]  You understand it.
[01:46:51.028 --> 01:46:58.090]  You understand that it's taking legitimate grievances that American citizens of every race, color, and creed
[01:46:59.605 --> 01:46:59.865]  Felt.
[01:47:00.665 --> 01:47:02.086]  They felt like their vote had been stolen.
[01:47:02.226 --> 01:47:05.708]  They felt like their elections had been jacked with extra legally.
[01:47:06.928 --> 01:47:14.491]  They felt like their concerns were outright dismissed by the authorities from the media to the government itself and everybody in between.
[01:47:14.511 --> 01:47:21.154]  They held March after March after March, each one bigger than the last.
[01:47:21.254 --> 01:47:23.175]  Each one, by the way, attacked by Antifa.
[01:47:24.855 --> 01:47:28.097]  Videos afterwards of families of small children being violently attacked.
[01:47:29.031 --> 01:47:30.833]  Afterwards, and no reporting on this.
[01:47:31.133 --> 01:47:32.094]  No talking about this.
[01:47:32.134 --> 01:47:33.936]  You think that might enrage some people?
[01:47:34.636 --> 01:47:42.364]  You think it might enrage some people to try over and over and over again to peacefully have their voices heard only to be demonized?
[01:47:42.704 --> 01:47:47.469]  Only to be told the only reason you're really doing this is because you're a racist white person?
[01:47:47.589 --> 01:47:49.190]  Wouldn't that inspire a little bit of rage?
[01:47:51.332 --> 01:47:53.855]  Wouldn't it inspire rage in black people?
[01:47:55.444 --> 01:48:04.150]  If they had the media, every single channel, people in Congress, talking about Black Lives Matter and just saying, look, this is just black outrage.
[01:48:04.190 --> 01:48:05.211]  This is just black rage.
[01:48:05.812 --> 01:48:06.412]  That's all it is.
[01:48:06.632 --> 01:48:07.753]  They're just mad that they're black.
[01:48:08.253 --> 01:48:12.516]  They're mad because they're black or they're mad, you know, as a condition of being black.
[01:48:13.797 --> 01:48:15.519]  So you can ignore all of their concerns.
[01:48:15.559 --> 01:48:17.420]  You can ignore all of their complaints.
[01:48:17.460 --> 01:48:19.561]  You can brush them under the rug.
[01:48:21.343 --> 01:48:22.023]  They're just black.
[01:48:22.303 --> 01:48:24.205]  Doesn't that cause a little bit of outrage in the black community?
[01:48:27.301 --> 01:48:27.941]  Be dismissed?
[01:48:28.461 --> 01:48:32.262]  Not just dismissed, but slandered as you're being dismissed?
[01:48:33.062 --> 01:48:34.363]  Libeled as you're being dismissed?
[01:48:34.383 --> 01:48:38.464]  Having your concerns not even heard, but called racist?
[01:48:38.484 --> 01:48:41.945]  Wouldn't that cause a little bit of rage for anybody that it was subjected to?
[01:48:41.965 --> 01:48:51.627]  So this utter incompetent has been involved in a few other things over the last few years.
[01:48:52.948 --> 01:48:53.608]  From the New York Times,
[01:48:54.782 --> 01:49:00.568]  One year ago, in June 2020, General Milley apologizes for his role in Trump photo op.
[01:49:00.688 --> 01:49:01.569]  I should not have been there.
[01:49:04.209 --> 01:49:14.934]  The country's top military official apologized on Thursday for taking part in President Trump's walk across Lafayette Square for a photo op after the authorities used tear gas and rubber bullets to clear the area of peaceful protesters.
[01:49:15.474 --> 01:49:22.397]  Quote, I should not have been there, General Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a pre-recorded video commencement address to the National Defense University.
[01:49:22.698 --> 01:49:27.500]  My presence at that moment in that environment created a perception of a military involved in domestic politics.
[01:49:28.499 --> 01:49:32.843]  See, he's very concerned about seeming as if he's involved in domestic politics.
[01:49:33.223 --> 01:49:47.076]  That's why he gets up in front of the Congress and spouts off a diatribe of the ideas of critical race theory in full support of the leftist agenda, in purging the military of those who hold conservative positions.
[01:49:47.116 --> 01:49:49.438]  That's just how apolitical he is, you see.
[01:49:49.898 --> 01:49:54.403]  But he also, it also, I don't know if you remember this, about a month ago, an investigation revealed
[01:49:55.287 --> 01:50:06.231]  That this photo op in which authorities used tear gas to get away with the protesters so they could have this photo op, which all of this outrage was predicated on, was a lie.
[01:50:07.011 --> 01:50:09.912]  So this is General Milley falling for another lie of the media.
[01:50:10.712 --> 01:50:10.912]  Right?
[01:50:11.172 --> 01:50:12.313]  And being forced to apologize.
[01:50:12.353 --> 01:50:12.913]  And groveling.
[01:50:12.973 --> 01:50:16.554]  Oh, I spent days agonizing over my participation in this.
[01:50:17.194 --> 01:50:18.915]  Well, you fell for another lie, moron.
[01:50:21.015 --> 01:50:22.936]  Just like you're falling for the lie of white rage.
[01:50:22.976 --> 01:50:25.278]  Just like you're falling for the lie of critical race theory.
[01:50:25.678 --> 01:50:30.902]  Just like you fell for the lie of 1619 and 400 years of slavery.
[01:50:31.182 --> 01:50:39.348]  He literally says, what we're seeing is the protests have not have ended, not only speak of his killing, but of the centuries of injustice towards African Americans.
[01:50:39.388 --> 01:50:44.291]  What we're seeing is the long shadow of our original sin in Jamestown 401 years ago.
[01:50:44.311 --> 01:50:46.853]  A real apolitical, buddy.
[01:50:50.069 --> 01:51:09.127]  He called on the military to address issues of systemic racism in the armed forces, where 43% of the enlisted troops are people of color, but only a tiny handful are in the ranks of senior leadership.
[01:51:09.888 --> 01:51:11.750]  Well, you should lower your standards, obviously.
[01:51:12.861 --> 01:51:15.923]  You should put people in positions of power in the U.S.
[01:51:15.963 --> 01:51:17.684]  military because of their skin color.
[01:51:17.704 --> 01:51:18.884]  I think that's the right solution.
[01:51:19.144 --> 01:51:21.325]  Heck, it's working out great with old Lloyd Austin, isn't it?
[01:51:22.586 --> 01:51:24.807]  Ex-Raytheon director.
[01:51:26.448 --> 01:51:35.353]  Purging our military at the behest of and at the direction of and using the standards of the ADL and other racist supremacist organizations.
[01:51:37.234 --> 01:51:38.494]  But no, he's just so apolitical.
[01:51:38.714 --> 01:51:39.295]  But again, it's like,
[01:51:40.273 --> 01:51:41.894]  He does what he's supposed to do.
[01:51:41.934 --> 01:51:42.634]  He does his job.
[01:51:43.614 --> 01:51:44.775]  He's there protecting the President.
[01:51:45.996 --> 01:51:56.580]  The municipal authorities clear Lafayette Square of protesters because, you know, they're rioting and trying to burn down the White House and putting 60 Secret Service members in the hospital in a single night.
[01:51:56.860 --> 01:52:06.925]  You know, the actual insurrection, the actual coup, the actual ongoing violence that went on for a year without the authorities lifting a single finger also contributed to white rage, by the way, if that's what you want to call it.
[01:52:07.725 --> 01:52:09.526]  Rage of regular Americans.
[01:52:09.886 --> 01:52:15.428]  You know, the rage, white rage, if you really want to define it as that, you know where it's expressed?
[01:52:15.948 --> 01:52:17.849]  It's expressed at school board meetings.
[01:52:18.329 --> 01:52:20.510]  It's expressed at city council meetings.
[01:52:22.131 --> 01:52:24.412]  It's expressed in Congress to you just now.
[01:52:25.632 --> 01:52:26.373]  And they're shut down.
[01:52:26.553 --> 01:52:27.293]  They're arrested.
[01:52:28.834 --> 01:52:29.474]  They're ignored.
[01:52:31.435 --> 01:52:36.597]  What about big white rage armed protest in Richmond, Virginia?
[01:52:37.725 --> 01:52:38.326]  Two years ago.
[01:52:39.667 --> 01:52:44.431]  Tens of thousands of angry white guys getting together and peacefully demonstrating.
[01:52:44.471 --> 01:52:45.191]  Nothing destroyed.
[01:52:45.732 --> 01:52:46.312]  Nobody hurt.
[01:52:46.332 --> 01:52:48.054]  20,000 guns.
[01:52:49.195 --> 01:52:49.455]  Nothing.
[01:52:49.855 --> 01:52:50.296]  No arrests.
[01:52:52.458 --> 01:52:52.898]  What happened?
[01:52:53.599 --> 01:52:54.559]  They passed the bill anyway.
[01:52:56.961 --> 01:52:58.102]  I'm not talking about white rage.
[01:53:00.224 --> 01:53:02.166]  It's the least effective rage of all time.
[01:53:04.844 --> 01:53:11.206]  It's the only rage that our authorities feel fine with ignoring and then making illegal.
[01:53:14.188 --> 01:53:20.550]  So Mark Milley, you idiot, time and time again, you keep getting fooled, you keep falling for it and trusting the same people.
[01:53:20.570 --> 01:53:29.053]  You're tuned in to the American Journal with your host, Harrison Smith.
[01:53:29.594 --> 01:53:32.575]  Watch it live right now at band.video.
[01:53:33.669 --> 01:53:38.431]  Gateway Pundit has this headline, is Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin really this clueless?
[01:53:40.491 --> 01:53:54.336]  And they talk about his apparent ignorance of the fact that the guy that he hired, Bishop Garrison, in order to oversee the purging of the American military, of anybody that, you know, opposes them,
[01:53:57.237 --> 01:53:57.938]  Uh, apparently didn't know.
[01:53:58.158 --> 01:54:05.943]  He said, uh, this article goes on to say, quote, it's astonishing that Lloyd Austin would admit he had no idea that Bishop Garrison is associated with critical race theory.
[01:54:07.644 --> 01:54:09.045]  They say, Lloyd Austin's not a stupid man.
[01:54:09.085 --> 01:54:10.666]  He's articulate and educated.
[01:54:10.706 --> 01:54:13.789]  More articulate, in fact, than the dunderhead chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Milley.
[01:54:14.689 --> 01:54:17.391]  But Austin is either lying or intellectually incurious.
[01:54:17.631 --> 01:54:24.336]  Who would give Garrison the position of senior advisor to the Secretary of Defense for Diversity and Inclusion without checking out his writings and public comments?
[01:54:26.158 --> 01:54:27.639]  And this is the guy that they put in charge of
[01:54:56.121 --> 01:54:57.542]  Purging the military of extremists.
[01:54:59.202 --> 01:55:03.464]  And his definition of extremist is... You think the government is corrupt.
[01:55:05.205 --> 01:55:06.765]  It's not that hard to figure out.
[01:55:07.525 --> 01:55:12.768]  They're purging anybody... who believes in the American way.
[01:55:14.368 --> 01:55:19.350]  And knowing that all governments are in some way corrupt and our system is there to prevent them from exercising that corruption.
[01:55:21.271 --> 01:55:22.631]  I mean, it's just insane.
[01:55:23.232 --> 01:55:23.632]  It's insane.
[01:55:23.652 --> 01:55:23.932]  Of course...
[01:55:25.592 --> 01:55:43.586]  The critical race theory, Black Lives Matter ideology says that our entire government was founded for and because of racism and that all of its institutions from the police to the filibuster are remnants of that racial corruption and must be destroyed.
[01:55:44.627 --> 01:55:53.294]  I wonder if that's what they mean when they talk about the government being corrupt as a symptom of being an extremist.
[01:55:53.314 --> 01:55:54.535]  Of course not, obviously not, right?
[01:55:56.189 --> 01:55:58.692]  So I'd have to agree with the writer of this Gateway Pundit article.
[01:55:58.792 --> 01:56:00.934]  Lloyd Austin is not clueless.
[01:56:01.394 --> 01:56:02.516]  He knows exactly what he's doing.
[01:56:03.016 --> 01:56:03.837]  He's doing it on purpose.
[01:56:04.377 --> 01:56:07.260]  He's very devious in this rollout.
[01:56:07.941 --> 01:56:08.422]  Very devious.
[01:56:08.522 --> 01:56:15.669]  Mark Milley, on the other hand, I'm more and more convinced as the day goes on, is an idiot of the highest degree.
[01:56:15.929 --> 01:56:18.071]  I mean, this guy really just must be
[01:56:19.332 --> 01:56:19.972]  Dumb as a brick.
[01:56:20.312 --> 01:56:22.013]  He's good at following orders, that much is clear.
[01:56:22.313 --> 01:56:26.355]  He's good at acting like the orders that he's following are legitimate and worthy.
[01:56:27.075 --> 01:56:30.897]  He's very good at obeying his authorities, whoever they may be.
[01:56:30.977 --> 01:56:32.537]  He's supposed to be at the top.
[01:56:32.977 --> 01:56:33.578]  He's clearly not.
[01:56:33.758 --> 01:56:37.179]  He's clearly manipulated by people in the media or the people around him.
[01:56:38.940 --> 01:56:46.583]  Exhibit A is this apology he issued, this groveling he put out after a very appropriate, very normal,
[01:56:49.773 --> 01:56:51.095]  Excursion in Washington, D.C.
[01:56:52.398 --> 01:56:54.321]  He actually considered resigning because of this.
[01:56:55.664 --> 01:56:57.908]  And we know the entire thing was predicated on a lie.
[01:56:59.244 --> 01:57:00.344]  The lie was that the U.S.
[01:57:00.384 --> 01:57:06.887]  military, at the behest of Trump, used tear gas and munitions to clear Lafayette Square for a photo op.
[01:57:07.167 --> 01:57:17.811]  That was the lie that all of this is based on, and it was revealed through an extensive investigation just a few months ago that the entire thing was a falsehood, the entire thing was a fabrication, it didn't actually exist.
[01:57:18.551 --> 01:57:22.673]  But at the time, they used that lie to convince General Milley to grovel and apologize.
[01:57:23.293 --> 01:57:28.855]  He's literally like, oh, I spent days, he's been agonizing about appearing in that photo.
[01:57:31.633 --> 01:57:41.455]  And he says, my appearance in that photo sparked a debate around the country about the politicization of the military.
[01:57:41.475 --> 01:57:42.895]  It's like, I can't have that.
[01:57:42.915 --> 01:57:43.796]  And it's like, no, it didn't.
[01:57:44.356 --> 01:57:44.876]  No, it didn't.
[01:57:44.936 --> 01:57:48.076]  It's a smear that they use to humiliate you.
[01:57:48.657 --> 01:57:50.737]  And you have been thoroughly humiliated, sir.
[01:57:54.278 --> 01:57:57.859]  I mean, the weakness that this shows.
[01:57:57.879 --> 01:57:59.539]  You know what the correct response would have been?
[01:58:00.595 --> 01:58:06.059]  Uh, I'm the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and I was protecting the President of the United States.
[01:58:07.601 --> 01:58:10.683]  If you want to try to act like that's a bad thing, go get stuffed.
[01:58:11.764 --> 01:58:14.866]  That's the correct, that's, that would be a non-cowardly response, see?
[01:58:15.587 --> 01:58:16.207]  He's a coward.
[01:58:17.068 --> 01:58:23.193]  He agonized for 10 days over the lies that he was being told, then he apologized and groveled and humiliated himself.
[01:58:24.814 --> 01:58:25.915]  On the basis of these lies,
[01:58:31.536 --> 01:58:34.337]  And I still don't think he knows he's being used.
[01:58:34.577 --> 01:58:44.180]  He still doesn't understand that he has been used by the mainstream media to progress their agenda the entire time.
[01:58:44.340 --> 01:58:46.261]  But there's more that he's been involved in the last few years.
[01:58:46.901 --> 01:58:52.122]  Joint Chiefs head says military won't have a role in resolving the 2020 elections.
[01:58:52.663 --> 01:58:59.405]  He's just so, so concerned about making sure the military seems apolitical.
[01:58:59.745 --> 01:59:00.405]  That's why he's
[01:59:02.022 --> 01:59:07.565]  You know, encouraging reading critical race theory in military academies.
[01:59:07.905 --> 01:59:15.750]  That's why he is in favor of purging the military of Trump supporters, Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, anybody in the right wing, because he's so apolitical.
[01:59:16.570 --> 01:59:20.352]  He's so apolitical that he's going to politicize the military.
[01:59:24.454 --> 01:59:25.275]  This guy's not smart.
[01:59:26.493 --> 01:59:32.717]  This guy's a very dumb person that's being manipulated by people smarter than him who are cackling like hyenas in the background.
[01:59:35.479 --> 01:59:36.740]  It really is humiliating.
[01:59:36.880 --> 01:59:38.421]  He doesn't even know that he's being humiliated.
[01:59:41.923 --> 01:59:42.824]  Probably getting patted on the back.
[01:59:42.844 --> 01:59:43.884]  Wow, that was really good, Mark.
[01:59:43.924 --> 01:59:44.705]  Yeah.
[01:59:44.745 --> 01:59:46.366]  Yeah, you really stood up to them now.
[01:59:46.486 --> 01:59:52.070]  All the papers are writing articles talking about how you smacked back at Matt Gaetz.
[01:59:52.090 --> 01:59:53.331]  You destroyed Matt Gaetz.
[01:59:53.551 --> 01:59:54.411]  Yeah, you're doing great, man.
[01:59:54.431 --> 01:59:55.192]  You're doing really great.
[01:59:57.995 --> 02:00:01.237]  Then like he leaves the room, they're just like, oh my god, that guy is dumb as hell.
[02:00:01.897 --> 02:00:03.098]  They're laughing at you, Mark Milley!
[02:00:03.598 --> 02:00:04.799]  They're laughing at you, okay?
[02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:07.880]  But why did he say this?
[02:00:07.940 --> 02:00:11.643]  Why did he say that the military wouldn't have a role in resolving the 2020 election?
[02:00:12.443 --> 02:00:20.627]  It's because at the time, President Joe Biden was suggesting the military would remove Trump from the White House.
[02:00:21.748 --> 02:00:26.571]  He was saying that he would order the military to forcibly remove the sitting president
[02:00:27.554 --> 02:00:28.615]  From the executive mansion.
[02:00:31.677 --> 02:00:35.560]  Maybe that's politicizing the military, moron!
[02:00:38.703 --> 02:00:39.443]  He's like, no, no.
[02:00:40.224 --> 02:00:44.547]  That sparked a national debate of the role of the military in civil society, Milley said in a video in June.
[02:00:44.787 --> 02:00:45.688]  I should not have been there.
[02:00:45.708 --> 02:00:50.712]  He's just groveling, apologizing over blatant lies that he never should apologize for.
[02:00:52.210 --> 02:00:52.770]  What about this one?
[02:00:53.230 --> 02:00:57.291]  Pelosi calls General Milley to block unhinged Trump from using the nuclear codes.
[02:00:57.531 --> 02:01:08.294]  Do you remember when the House Speaker of the Congress tried to get the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the military to usurp the sovereign right of the duly elected President?
[02:01:08.494 --> 02:01:09.934]  Do you remember that coup attempt?
[02:01:10.974 --> 02:01:12.415]  That's what a coup attempt looks like.
[02:01:12.735 --> 02:01:15.375]  That is an attempt to overthrow the Constitution.
[02:01:15.635 --> 02:01:16.776]  Any concern about that?
[02:01:17.976 --> 02:01:18.636]  Moron Milley?
[02:01:22.961 --> 02:01:28.444]  Did you feel the need to step up and push back against that literal coup attempt?
[02:01:28.904 --> 02:01:34.146]  A literal usurpation of power by an American politician?
[02:01:35.547 --> 02:01:38.008]  Or did you just allow that to go on?
[02:01:38.468 --> 02:01:40.109]  Did they just humiliate you there also?
[02:01:41.750 --> 02:01:42.170]  What about this?
[02:01:42.250 --> 02:01:46.632]  Pelosi pushes back on Joint Chief Chairman's account of guard deployment on January 6th.
[02:01:46.952 --> 02:01:50.494]  Did you forget that Nancy Pelosi blamed you for January 6th?
[02:01:51.815 --> 02:01:52.155]  She did.
[02:01:53.621 --> 02:01:56.282]  Milley said there's no attempt to delay the deployment of the National Guard.
[02:01:56.522 --> 02:02:07.786]  This is in pushback to Pelosi coming out and saying that essentially she accused General Mark Milley of withholding a reaction to January 6th and allowing the riot to happen.
[02:02:08.266 --> 02:02:09.046]  She blamed you for this.
[02:02:09.426 --> 02:02:10.167]  Is it blackmail?
[02:02:10.227 --> 02:02:10.987]  Is it extortion?
[02:02:11.347 --> 02:02:15.769]  Are they saying you're going to take the blame for this unless you help us turn it into a racial thing?
[02:02:17.029 --> 02:02:20.710]  Unless you help us purge the military, you're going to be on the docket for January 6th?
[02:02:21.030 --> 02:02:22.351]  Are you being extorted, General Milley?
[02:02:23.547 --> 02:02:25.869]  Or are you just too dumb to understand how you're being manipulated?
[02:02:25.929 --> 02:02:28.070]  These are the questions I think we need to answer.
[02:02:29.811 --> 02:02:32.533]  Because Mark Milley is clearly an incompetent.
[02:02:32.653 --> 02:02:34.595]  He clearly doesn't understand what's going on here.
[02:02:35.855 --> 02:02:45.702]  He clearly is a useful tool of much smarter people who like to use his rank and his colorful ribbons to provide authority to the blatant lies that they're spreading.
[02:02:46.863 --> 02:02:52.647]  And then he'll humiliate himself on the basis of these lies, apologize for the lie,
[02:02:54.807 --> 02:02:57.630]  And then return to his masters like the beaten dog that he is.
[02:02:59.071 --> 02:03:02.034]  And these are the people that run our entire military, folks.
[02:03:03.496 --> 02:03:03.836]  We're done.
[02:03:04.056 --> 02:03:04.617]  America's done.
[02:03:05.297 --> 02:03:07.400]  The globalists are mad scientists.
[02:03:07.760 --> 02:03:09.181]  They want to be God.
[02:03:09.822 --> 02:03:18.771]  And they are playing God with not just humans' health, and not just humans' reproductive cycles, but all the animals and plants on this planet.
[02:03:19.741 --> 02:03:36.621]  My friends, there is a long-term strategic plan that Aldous Huxley and Julian Huxley talked about 90 years ago to add chemicals and biologicals into the environment to manipulate the entire human species into a manageable horde of dumbed-down idiots that are sterile.
[02:03:37.262 --> 02:03:39.182]  And now their plan is out in the open.
[02:03:39.582 --> 02:03:50.764]  And there's so many of these chemicals they're hitting humans with, leaching into the environment, that most species of frogs are in danger of completely going extinct because the males are sterile and are only attracted to other males.
[02:03:51.524 --> 02:03:55.685]  And the studies show the same thing for fish, for monkeys, for mice, for everything.
[02:03:56.105 --> 02:03:57.686]  And the same thing has happened to humans.
[02:03:58.126 --> 02:04:04.707]  So when we say save the frogs, we mean become aware of the globalist chemical biological attack on humanity.
[02:04:05.067 --> 02:04:05.427]  And now.
[02:04:06.167 --> 02:04:21.017]  We have three new shirts that have come in to InfoWarsStore.com that I designed that I think are going to be a really great hit because they're classy looking, they come in three great colors, and they have a simple message that everybody agrees with.
[02:04:21.497 --> 02:04:23.018]  Save the frogs.
[02:04:23.138 --> 02:04:24.499]  InfoWars.com on the front.
[02:04:24.839 --> 02:04:29.121]  Over your heart, on the back, it's big, and it's a great way to start conversations.
[02:04:29.181 --> 02:04:30.181]  People will come up to you.
[02:04:30.421 --> 02:04:31.502]  They'll ask, what does that mean?
[02:04:31.542 --> 02:04:32.442]  What's that organization?
[02:04:32.782 --> 02:04:45.748]  And you can tell them, well, I'm sure you've heard about InfoWars and how they make fun of Alex Jones and the gay frogs, but there are real studies about this across the board, but not just atrazine and chemicals, but soy in major studies.
[02:04:46.650 --> 02:04:52.875]  He is also turning monkeys into these sterile effeminate, but also very, very aggressive incels.
[02:04:53.315 --> 02:04:54.376]  This is a huge topic.
[02:04:54.656 --> 02:04:56.117]  It's how the globalists are assaulting us.
[02:04:56.437 --> 02:04:58.779]  We've got three of the shirts in green, black, and cream.
[02:04:59.199 --> 02:04:59.680]  We love them.
[02:04:59.700 --> 02:05:01.942]  They're for men and women, and it supports the InfoWar.
[02:05:02.122 --> 02:05:05.044]  So get your Save the Frog shirts at InfoWarStore.com.
[02:05:05.344 --> 02:05:09.127]  It's hard to believe that July 4th, 2021 is almost here.
[02:05:11.108 --> 02:05:14.391]  It's hard to believe that our country is literally fighting for its life.
[02:05:15.540 --> 02:05:20.182]  But for all the negative things that are happening, a lot of really positive things are happening as well.
[02:05:20.822 --> 02:05:25.864]  It's been said by many historians that things have to get really, really bad before they get better.
[02:05:26.345 --> 02:05:29.326]  And we're now reaching that point of no return, that tipping point.
[02:05:29.486 --> 02:05:34.508]  Global government and its planetary depopulation plan is now out in the open.
[02:05:34.948 --> 02:05:37.689]  And people realize the time for fun and games is over.
[02:05:38.310 --> 02:05:41.111]  That's why I wanted to report to you, the listeners and viewers of this transmission,
[02:05:41.687 --> 02:05:44.028]  The good news today, as well as the bad news.
[02:05:44.688 --> 02:05:58.135]  I've been contacted in the last two weeks by some of the top people in international media and national news as well, as well as some of the folks at the highest levels of government, corporations, the private sector, you name it, and they've all told me the same thing.
[02:05:58.675 --> 02:05:59.455]  Alex, keep it up!
[02:06:00.416 --> 02:06:05.178]  You've been vindicated, and we're having a major breakthrough thanks to your work.
[02:06:05.964 --> 02:06:10.105]  Well, I wanted the listeners to know that it's you that have allowed this to happen.
[02:06:10.625 --> 02:06:23.028]  You have been just as important as I've been, and so at least now, world government is attacking, but we have a chance to defeat it because we've worked together for decades to warn people about what was coming.
[02:06:23.408 --> 02:06:24.289]  It sounded insane.
[02:06:24.349 --> 02:06:25.089]  It sounded crazy.
[02:06:25.129 --> 02:06:25.869]  It sounded dangerous.
[02:06:26.149 --> 02:06:26.929]  It sounded made up.
[02:06:27.269 --> 02:06:31.150]  It sounded like a horror movie, a science fiction dystopia, but it was real.
[02:06:31.850 --> 02:06:33.831]  And so we knew it was real, and we knew they were going to pull this.
[02:06:34.642 --> 02:06:40.125]  And so now that they've actually launched their operation, people aren't being completely caught flat-footed.
[02:06:40.525 --> 02:06:42.266]  So that's the real power of InfoWars.
[02:06:42.827 --> 02:06:45.188]  That's why it's more important than ever to help keep it on air.
[02:06:45.648 --> 02:06:53.713]  We have a July 4th special running right now with store-wide free shipping, double Patreon points is back as well, and up to 60% off best-selling items like X3.
[02:06:54.213 --> 02:07:03.959]  So please, take action today and help keep InfoWars on the air now more than ever, because our mission is proving that it's incredibly accurate and has been part of the human destiny for liberty and freedom.
