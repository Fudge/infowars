[00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:02.951]  They're saying they want to arrest us and re-educate us in camps.
[00:00:04.632 --> 00:00:05.853]  They're saying they want to kill us.
[00:00:05.873 --> 00:00:08.815]  They're saying they want to kill the president and his family.
[00:00:08.836 --> 00:00:15.000]  They have paramilitary thugs beating people up in the streets and shooting them in the head and burning down public housing.
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.183]  We have Joe Biden on TV saying, I don't even know what I'm signing.
[00:00:19.243 --> 00:00:23.286]  And then next he goes, I just banned saying China virus in the federal government.
[00:00:23.726 --> 00:00:25.388]  If it's in any document, it's illegal.
[00:00:25.868 --> 00:00:28.090]  And if you use a word, we're going to fire you.
[00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.951]  It's all naked insaneness.
[00:00:31.352 --> 00:00:35.034]  And Fauci said, I do think it's important that we all wear two masks now.
[00:00:35.054 --> 00:00:36.234]  Does everybody want to take the mask off?
[00:00:36.294 --> 00:00:36.955]  Oh, no, no.
[00:00:37.255 --> 00:00:37.655]  Two!
[00:00:37.975 --> 00:00:38.155]  Two!
[00:00:38.175 --> 00:00:39.556]  We got to inspect it to the right type.
[00:00:39.756 --> 00:00:40.497]  And, oh!
[00:00:40.997 --> 00:00:46.280]  Not to be outdone and make that sound unreasonable, now CNBC, AP, oh, actually, you need three masks.
[00:00:47.581 --> 00:00:48.681]  Just so happen I looked that up.
[00:00:48.881 --> 00:00:54.685]  With the different types of masks that are out there, depending on the type, one mask lowers your oxygen level about 20%.
[00:00:54.825 --> 00:00:56.766]  And oxygen is already a trace gas.
[00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:59.260]  Two masks lowers it even more.
[00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:13.751]  Three masks, I mean, hell, why not just get a noose, get a rope, put it over the rafters, put it on your neck, kick the stool, you know, jump off the stool, and you will not transmit COVID anymore because your neck's going to break and you're going to asphyxiate, you're going to die.
[00:01:14.111 --> 00:01:18.714]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:22.486 --> 00:01:30.653]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this January 27th, 2021 Wednesday broadcast.
[00:01:31.314 --> 00:01:37.560]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and we are going to have the founder of the Boogaloo Boys
[00:01:38.652 --> 00:01:43.834]  Joining us coming up on the broadcast today, that is Ian at the Second Hour.
[00:01:43.874 --> 00:01:50.537]  I appreciate Mr. Dunn coming on after I've said some critical things of his group.
[00:01:50.637 --> 00:01:57.440]  He says to set the record straight, so I look forward to that, because who's going to know more about the Boogaloos than the founder of the Boogaloos?
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.381]  So I'm really looking forward to that interview coming up.
[00:02:00.821 --> 00:02:03.083]  Owen Schroeder is going to be riding shotgun with me here.
[00:02:03.783 --> 00:02:06.024]  He'll be here for the next three, four hours.
[00:02:06.044 --> 00:02:08.245]  I'll be gone in two hours.
[00:02:08.285 --> 00:02:09.566]  Wild horses could not drag me away.
[00:02:09.586 --> 00:02:11.167]  So much important news unfolding.
[00:02:11.927 --> 00:02:17.490]  Roger Stone has been quiet the last few weeks and said that he's not ready to go on air until he has something big to say.
[00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.692]  Well, he texted me this morning and I called him.
[00:02:21.733 --> 00:02:24.455]  And he is on the show with big news.
[00:02:24.495 --> 00:02:28.979]  I'll leave it at that at 1130 Central tomorrow.
[00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.101]  Roger's not been doing interviews.
[00:02:33.043 --> 00:02:34.884]  Really because he doesn't want the media lying about him.
[00:02:34.904 --> 00:02:37.387]  He's just so overwhelmed the level of lies they tell about him.
[00:02:38.287 --> 00:02:42.151]  Them sending a SWAT team to his hotel room on the day of the Capitol.
[00:02:43.766 --> 00:02:44.847]  I don't know.
[00:02:58.769 --> 00:02:59.169]  Tomorrow.
[00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.072]  And yes, folks, they sent a SWAT team to the hotel we were staying at.
[00:03:02.112 --> 00:03:03.073]  They tried to get me too.
[00:03:03.974 --> 00:03:06.156]  Then I guess later figured out that I'd actually tried to stop the riot.
[00:03:06.196 --> 00:03:16.805]  But that's the level of the media's disinfo, is that they sent SWAT teams for us until they later found out that we had not instigated the Capitol event.
[00:03:17.746 --> 00:03:21.810]  So again, Roger will be talking about the impeachment trial.
[00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.281]  That starts on the 8th against President Trump.
[00:03:25.301 --> 00:03:33.305]  And there's a very, very important video posted to Bandock that has the headline, Proof President Trump did not incite the riot.
[00:03:33.505 --> 00:03:36.186]  But I think that's not even a strong enough headline.
[00:03:36.206 --> 00:03:38.968]  I think we're going to change it to, Must Watch.
[00:03:39.488 --> 00:03:44.410]  InfoWars security team lays out what really happened at the U.S.
[00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:45.231]  Capitol January 6th.
[00:03:47.427 --> 00:03:53.090]  We've gone ahead and gotten a whole timeline together and broken down exactly who did what, when.
[00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.593]  But there it is, exclusive proof Trump did not incite the Capitol riot.
[00:03:58.633 --> 00:04:00.074]  And so many people have moved on from Trump.
[00:04:00.094 --> 00:04:00.914]  They're like, well, it doesn't matter.
[00:04:00.934 --> 00:04:01.454]  He's out of office.
[00:04:01.474 --> 00:04:02.455]  Who cares if he gets in trouble?
[00:04:03.435 --> 00:04:06.017]  If they're able to hang the fraud,
[00:04:07.546 --> 00:04:10.187]  Around the President's neck, that he incited this on purpose.
[00:04:10.827 --> 00:04:19.691]  They were able to pass this legislation that's five times worse than the Patriot Act against the American people, where they say they're going to use the Pentagon and the CIA against the American people.
[00:04:20.391 --> 00:04:21.392]  Now, that doesn't scare me.
[00:04:21.492 --> 00:04:25.734]  Actually, that makes me mad, and it makes me understand that I guess they want a violent revolution.
[00:04:25.754 --> 00:04:31.176]  They're probably going to get one, because they certainly have done enough to warrant a revolution.
[00:04:31.216 --> 00:04:33.297]  The problem is they're going to stage false flags.
[00:04:34.372 --> 00:04:34.612]  I think so.
[00:04:59.793 --> 00:05:02.994]  I've had my ass handed to me more than once, like the Capitol.
[00:05:03.674 --> 00:05:11.835]  Our biggest triumph, a million people peacefully so they'd have a 10-day investigation, and then a couple hundred antifun others take it all away from us, and I should have known they would do something like that.
[00:05:12.495 --> 00:05:13.916]  I should have known, but I didn't.
[00:05:14.736 --> 00:05:21.957]  And so those of you out there that are like, oh, let's just have a violent revolution, you're always the ones that are asking somebody else to do it.
[00:05:23.197 --> 00:05:25.718]  You're always the ones asking somebody else to do it.
[00:05:26.704 --> 00:05:27.584]  You know, take the Boogaloos.
[00:05:27.724 --> 00:05:33.546]  They said, and I'm going to ask Mr. Dunn about this, that they were going to have an armed march the weekend after the 6th.
[00:05:34.426 --> 00:05:36.566]  But if you just have an armed march in D.C., they'll arrest you for that.
[00:05:36.666 --> 00:05:37.987]  You can say, well, it's my Second Amendment.
[00:05:38.187 --> 00:05:38.947]  They'll still arrest you.
[00:05:40.487 --> 00:05:43.628]  And so then we didn't see the Boogaloos show up armed.
[00:05:44.168 --> 00:05:45.329]  Were they hoping other people would?
[00:05:45.869 --> 00:05:46.209]  I don't know.
[00:05:47.133 --> 00:05:52.497]  I just don't like this thing of let's have violent revolution and then people say, okay, well, you go first.
[00:05:52.897 --> 00:05:54.018]  Well, I'm not going first.
[00:05:54.138 --> 00:06:00.063]  And even if I could get somebody else to be violent, I don't want to sit back and watch that happen because I don't like playing God.
[00:06:00.403 --> 00:06:02.865]  The globalists though are starting it and they'll probably get what they want.
[00:06:03.685 --> 00:06:09.109]  And ladies and gentlemen, we are live on this Wednesday, 27th day of January, 2021.
[00:06:13.035 --> 00:06:19.658]  Coming up in 11 days, the trial of the 45th President of the United States begins in the U.S.
[00:06:19.698 --> 00:06:19.978]  Senate.
[00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:23.980]  A impeachment in the House is only an indictment.
[00:06:25.481 --> 00:06:28.342]  Impeachment in the House is only an indictment.
[00:06:28.382 --> 00:06:31.124]  So what they did last year in January is nothing.
[00:06:31.924 --> 00:06:41.629]  What they're starting up again this January in the House that they passed last week is something because it's an actual trial for the President supposedly inciting
[00:06:43.378 --> 00:06:44.238]  Well, I was there.
[00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:54.346]  I worked with five other organizations to organize legal, lawful, peaceful events with the Secret Service, metal detectors, and porta-potties.
[00:06:55.326 --> 00:06:56.527]  And that's what the President wanted.
[00:06:56.587 --> 00:06:59.109]  He said, repeatedly, we're going to peacefully march.
[00:06:59.149 --> 00:07:00.030]  His son said that.
[00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:04.213]  And so to say that his rhetoric that isn't one-tenth as aggressive as the Democrats'
[00:07:05.182 --> 00:07:08.604]  Burn it all down, Civil War, New York Times, Atlantic Monthly.
[00:07:09.064 --> 00:07:11.446]  Go to their houses, go get in their faces.
[00:07:12.006 --> 00:07:14.227]  Pelosi saying burning down buildings is just what people do.
[00:07:14.787 --> 00:07:18.590]  Their rhetoric is at least 10 times what the Republican rhetoric has been.
[00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:23.012]  The idea that Republicans want to burn things down and blow things up.
[00:07:23.032 --> 00:07:26.314]  But regardless, this is the trial of the president.
[00:07:26.374 --> 00:07:27.535]  And I think he should be there.
[00:07:28.035 --> 00:07:29.075]  I think he should testify.
[00:07:29.095 --> 00:07:32.758]  And this is really Trump's chance to turn the tide.
[00:07:33.976 --> 00:07:38.539]  And instead of having his tail between his legs, go in there and just lay out the facts.
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.761]  Exhibit 1, here I am saying don't be violent.
[00:07:41.041 --> 00:07:44.204]  Exhibit 2, Exhibit 3, I've had hundreds and hundreds of rallies that are peaceful.
[00:07:44.524 --> 00:07:52.690]  Exhibit 4, here's all these Democrats, including Nancy Pelosi calling for violence at Maxine Waters and calling for killing Trump and killing his supporters.
[00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:56.233]  I'll show a montage of Trump supporters being attacked because he's going to be able to show his video.
[00:07:58.274 --> 00:08:02.036]  And then, hey, call me up before the Senate in the trial.
[00:08:02.556 --> 00:08:05.058]  Call up the other organizations and groups that were there.
[00:08:05.538 --> 00:08:13.082]  And they'll sit there and point blank tell you, why the hell would we want to storm a Capitol and ruin everything we were doing trying to point out that the election was fraudulent?
[00:08:13.462 --> 00:08:14.603]  Why would we want to discredit that?
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.221]  To make sure they ended up voting against having a 10-day investigation.
[00:08:18.601 --> 00:08:20.962]  It's called a motive, and the other side had the motive.
[00:08:21.422 --> 00:08:28.584]  And of course, that's why Antifun, other leprous control groups, took responsibility for breaking in, getting the police to attack the general crowd.
[00:08:29.004 --> 00:08:33.125]  Then people yelled, attack, get in, in a very small percentage, not even one half of 1%.
[00:08:33.165 --> 00:08:38.227]  We had a million people there in DC, a couple hundred thousand there at the Capitol.
[00:08:38.627 --> 00:08:42.828]  We're talking about less than 1% that actually went in there, and most of them between the velvet ropes.
[00:08:43.208 --> 00:08:44.569]  And notice it's all the velvet rope people
[00:08:46.112 --> 00:08:46.332]  That's
[00:09:06.485 --> 00:09:07.966]  Don't you think he gets all that now?
[00:09:08.006 --> 00:09:08.566]  It doesn't matter.
[00:09:08.806 --> 00:09:11.707]  They want to hurt him to associate it with all of us.
[00:09:11.827 --> 00:09:16.089]  He is now a symbol of America and populist resistance.
[00:09:16.109 --> 00:09:17.790]  And if you don't get that, you don't get anything.
[00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:19.291]  And all I get is persecution.
[00:09:20.531 --> 00:09:24.033]  I've been told, you know, a year ago, two years ago, come out against the Second Amendment.
[00:09:25.693 --> 00:09:29.455]  Come out against President Trump and all your problems will be over and you'll get money.
[00:09:31.616 --> 00:09:33.037]  Now, those are off-record meetings.
[00:09:33.077 --> 00:09:38.201]  I can't say who, but I'm sure people can add 2 plus 2 and know what number it comes up with.
[00:09:38.621 --> 00:09:40.102]  But I signed non-disclosures and everything.
[00:09:40.122 --> 00:09:41.724]  You understand?
[00:09:42.404 --> 00:09:44.526]  With multiple globalist power groups.
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:47.781]  Trying to get me to stop.
[00:09:48.521 --> 00:09:54.365]  And almost everybody else takes the money because they go, hey, I got a carrot and I got a stick.
[00:09:54.845 --> 00:10:00.088]  So there's all these fools that go on and go, Jones is defending Trump because he makes money off of it.
[00:10:00.448 --> 00:10:07.152]  Yeah, if you think 50 Democrat lawsuits and getting deplatformed, your bank account's taken and PayPal taken away and it's kicked off everything.
[00:10:07.272 --> 00:10:09.093]  Oh man, it's wonderful.
[00:10:09.934 --> 00:10:13.136]  It's so good to stand up for Trump.
[00:10:14.685 --> 00:10:27.995]  But regardless, Trump made a lot of mistakes, and now he's losing his bank accounts, he's lost his YouTube, he's lost over 60 other platforms, so he can be silenced, listen to this, silenced ahead of and during his trial.
[00:10:29.436 --> 00:10:32.758]  And I guarantee they're saying, oh, let the president's lawyers put on the defense.
[00:10:32.938 --> 00:10:33.259]  No.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:35.981]  Put Trump in there.
[00:10:37.025 --> 00:10:41.468]  Put Trump in there on the witness seat and let them attack him and lie about him.
[00:10:41.828 --> 00:10:48.873]  And all he's got to do is have a hit list of exhibits after they attack him that he puts on and it will destroy them.
[00:10:49.413 --> 00:10:50.834]  Right out of a Perry Mason movie.
[00:10:51.814 --> 00:10:56.938]  Or right out of the real footage of the famous House Committee on American Activities.
[00:10:59.022 --> 00:11:03.326]  And then the Senate Committee on Un-American Activities and the lawyer says, have you no decency?
[00:11:03.647 --> 00:11:04.908]  You know, just that point.
[00:11:05.709 --> 00:11:10.073]  And I mean, I could go into that Senate trial and annihilate them.
[00:11:10.634 --> 00:11:11.675]  Annihilate them.
[00:11:12.556 --> 00:11:13.537]  This is their Waterloo.
[00:11:13.777 --> 00:11:16.239]  But of course, they're always the aggressive globalists.
[00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:18.041]  We always cower to them.
[00:11:18.081 --> 00:11:20.604]  We always act like we're the bad guys and we're on the defense.
[00:11:22.062 --> 00:11:26.186]  The answer is offense, offense, offense, offense, offense.
[00:11:26.466 --> 00:11:38.457]  We have giant banking cartels that are foreign-owned, that own big tech, that are now systematically shutting down tens of millions of Americans with AI, surveilling us and censoring us as a political class.
[00:11:38.898 --> 00:11:41.801]  They're saying they want to arrest us and re-educate us in camps.
[00:11:43.462 --> 00:11:44.663]  They're saying they want to kill us.
[00:11:45.626 --> 00:11:47.647]  We're saying they want to kill the president and his family.
[00:11:47.667 --> 00:11:53.809]  They have paramilitary thugs beating people up in the streets and shooting them in the head and burning down public housing.
[00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:58.131]  We have Joe Biden on TV saying, I don't even know what I'm signing.
[00:11:58.191 --> 00:12:02.113]  And next he goes, I just banned saying China virus in the federal government.
[00:12:02.533 --> 00:12:04.194]  If it's in any document, it's illegal.
[00:12:04.694 --> 00:12:06.915]  And if you use a word, we're going to fire you.
[00:12:07.615 --> 00:12:09.775]  It's all naked insaneness.
[00:12:10.176 --> 00:12:13.836]  And Fauci said, I do think it's important that we all wear two masks now.
[00:12:13.856 --> 00:12:15.057]  So everybody wants to take the mask off?
[00:12:15.117 --> 00:12:15.777]  Oh, no, no.
[00:12:16.097 --> 00:12:16.497]  Two!
[00:12:16.797 --> 00:12:16.977]  Two!
[00:12:17.017 --> 00:12:18.377]  We got to inspect it to the right type.
[00:12:18.597 --> 00:12:19.317]  And oh!
[00:12:19.838 --> 00:12:25.099]  Not to be outdone and make that sound unreasonable, now CNBC, AP, oh, actually, you need three masks.
[00:12:26.399 --> 00:12:27.499]  Just so happen I looked that up.
[00:12:27.699 --> 00:12:33.500]  With the different types of masks that are out there, depending on the type, one mask lowers your oxygen level about 20%.
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.601]  And oxygen is already a trace gas.
[00:12:36.618 --> 00:12:38.099]  Two masks lowers it even more.
[00:12:38.259 --> 00:12:52.550]  Three masks, I mean, hell, why not just get a noose, get a rope, put it over the rafters, put it on your neck, kick the stool, jump off the stool, and you will not transmit COVID anymore because your neck's going to break and you're going to asphyxiate, you're going to die.
[00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:58.855]  You're going to crap your britches and they're going to come in and they're going to cut you down and they're going to go put you in the ground somewhere.
[00:12:59.035 --> 00:12:59.715]  Please don't do that.
[00:12:59.775 --> 00:13:00.596]  I'm not being serious.
[00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:04.131]  That's the point we've reached.
[00:13:04.352 --> 00:13:06.394]  And again, this is too evil to fail.
[00:13:06.574 --> 00:13:08.015]  That's really the plan here.
[00:13:08.095 --> 00:13:10.038]  It's all about you're dirty, you're bad, you're evil.
[00:13:10.118 --> 00:13:15.163]  And now everyone I know knows someone that was old that took the COVID vaccine and died.
[00:13:15.443 --> 00:13:16.584]  John Rappaport's been talking about this today.
[00:13:16.625 --> 00:13:18.887]  He said 10 months ago, it's about targeting the old.
[00:13:20.088 --> 00:13:22.771]  And remember, the British ministry covered their ass a month and a half ago.
[00:13:22.791 --> 00:13:23.952]  They said, if you're over 75, don't take it.
[00:13:25.697 --> 00:13:26.937]  If you're under 16, don't take it.
[00:13:26.957 --> 00:13:28.558]  And if you're pregnant, don't take it.
[00:13:28.758 --> 00:13:29.958]  But see, it doesn't matter.
[00:13:30.018 --> 00:13:38.640]  The billboards and the doctors at the NIH here and the National Health Service in England, they all say the same thing.
[00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:40.740]  Whether it's Australia, the U.S., it's all U.N.-run.
[00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:41.860]  They admit the U.N.
[00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:42.421]  gives the orders.
[00:13:43.341 --> 00:13:48.082]  The United Nations said that you go ahead and give it to old people first.
[00:13:48.122 --> 00:13:49.102]  So I'm here in
[00:13:50.538 --> 00:13:53.520]  Utah, I was in Salt Lake at the My Patriot Supply Facility yesterday.
[00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:54.881]  It's incredible what you see the footage.
[00:13:55.121 --> 00:13:56.963]  Biggest warehouse I've ever been in.
[00:13:56.983 --> 00:13:57.483]  400,000 square feet.
[00:13:58.064 --> 00:13:59.225]  He put a Star Destroyer in there.
[00:14:00.065 --> 00:14:01.666]  And I saw billboards all over town.
[00:14:01.987 --> 00:14:04.388]  If you're above 70, you get it first.
[00:14:05.329 --> 00:14:06.770]  Oh, you're the most at-risk group.
[00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:08.011]  You're above 70.
[00:14:08.611 --> 00:14:09.912]  You get the vaccine first.
[00:14:10.773 --> 00:14:16.858]  When the National Health Service in England and the National Institutes of Health here in the United States
[00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:20.752]  Both have fine prints saying, if you're above 75, don't take it.
[00:14:20.972 --> 00:14:22.673]  But the billboards, you see how that works?
[00:14:23.053 --> 00:14:25.975]  The fine print says don't take it, but big blue and white billboards.
[00:14:26.015 --> 00:14:27.136]  Big flashing billboards.
[00:14:27.516 --> 00:14:28.797]  You need it if you're above 70.
[00:14:29.377 --> 00:14:30.097]  You need it.
[00:14:30.157 --> 00:14:30.658]  You need it.
[00:14:30.998 --> 00:14:32.719]  And I see the same damn billboards in Austin.
[00:14:33.059 --> 00:14:34.340]  I see the same damn billboards everywhere.
[00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:36.281]  You can be in Australia and see the same damn billboards.
[00:14:36.481 --> 00:14:40.504]  Because it's called gluh gluh gluh gluh gluh global government.
[00:14:41.377 --> 00:14:42.438]  We're good to go.
[00:15:02.014 --> 00:15:06.918]  of the Boogaloo Boys joining us in the second hour.
[00:15:07.658 --> 00:15:10.300]  And I really don't know what to make of this gentleman.
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:16.105]  I appreciate the fact that he's going to be coming on the broadcast, Mike Dunn.
[00:15:17.185 --> 00:15:19.187]  I really look forward to having him on next hour.
[00:15:19.227 --> 00:15:20.808]  That should be very, very interesting.
[00:15:20.828 --> 00:15:23.911]  And then as I said earlier, Roger Stone has been silent for weeks.
[00:15:25.193 --> 00:15:30.797]  He'll be joining after they have physically attacked his wife, threw her in the hospital at her house and sent a SWAT team to his house.
[00:15:30.817 --> 00:15:31.618]  But you know, it's no big deal.
[00:15:31.778 --> 00:15:32.858]  It's all part of living in a free society.
[00:15:33.299 --> 00:15:35.760]  But he'll be on the broadcast with us tomorrow.
[00:15:36.121 --> 00:15:36.901]  We'll be right back.
[00:15:36.961 --> 00:15:38.782]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[00:15:39.723 --> 00:15:40.864]  Here's an important quote.
[00:15:42.725 --> 00:15:43.225]  Welcome back.
[00:15:43.285 --> 00:15:46.588]  I'm your host Alex Jones coming to you from Utah in the beautiful mountains.
[00:15:47.813 --> 00:15:48.633]  The good Lord created.
[00:15:48.673 --> 00:15:50.014]  Owen Schroeder is back in the ATX.
[00:15:50.074 --> 00:15:53.155]  Let me read to you this quote from Martin Luther King Jr.
[00:15:53.375 --> 00:15:57.276]  in a 1963 letter from Birmingham Jail, that freedom is never given voluntarily.
[00:15:57.296 --> 00:15:58.797]  It's basically a re-quote of Frederick Douglass.
[00:15:59.397 --> 00:16:01.838]  Freedom is never given voluntarily by the oppressor.
[00:16:01.858 --> 00:16:03.898]  It must be demanded by the oppressed.
[00:16:04.238 --> 00:16:06.579]  You must demand it, for it will not be given freely.
[00:16:07.319 --> 00:16:11.601]  MLK also believed that liberty most often comes to those who petition for it peacefully.
[00:16:12.521 --> 00:16:16.483]  There's a lion meets the lamb dichotomy to the struggle.
[00:16:16.943 --> 00:16:19.484]  Peacefully achieved freedom is not safe from threat.
[00:16:19.965 --> 00:16:23.786]  It must and fiercely be defended as if it were ardently attained.
[00:16:24.787 --> 00:16:31.670]  But because of peace upon that which the freedom is built, its integrity is unassailable.
[00:16:32.551 --> 00:16:33.651]  So its integrity is unassailable.
[00:16:34.732 --> 00:16:38.934]  And that's why the globalists don't want a velvet revolution.
[00:16:39.994 --> 00:16:46.136]  Where we just say no to them and freedom is so much obviously better and that America is so much more better than globalism that we just reject it.
[00:16:46.536 --> 00:16:52.838]  They want to accelerate us into a physical conflict because they believe they can kill our free society and cement their takeover that way.
[00:16:53.658 --> 00:17:03.561]  That's why they're going to lead paramilitary groups that are either knowingly controlled or unknowingly controlled because of their low IQs into hitting targets that are not good targets.
[00:17:03.601 --> 00:17:05.602]  I mean let me tell you, I'm not saying kill anybody, okay?
[00:17:07.878 --> 00:17:11.742]  You know, the globalists coming at us with these deadly vaccines that they know are meant to depopulate us.
[00:17:12.002 --> 00:17:15.885]  These super unpopular top globalists, Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates.
[00:17:16.846 --> 00:17:21.290]  Notice you never see anybody actually going after the people above Biden, above Trump.
[00:17:22.511 --> 00:17:26.475]  There's all the secret service around the president to make you think they actually run things.
[00:17:27.796 --> 00:17:28.757]  That's why they hated Trump.
[00:17:28.957 --> 00:17:29.518]  With Trump,
[00:17:30.765 --> 00:17:33.907]  The first time since Ronald Reagan, we had a guy that was actually president.
[00:17:33.967 --> 00:17:36.289]  By the way, I've interviewed people that worked with Reagan very closely.
[00:17:36.629 --> 00:17:37.550]  It's in the memoirs.
[00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:38.570]  Nancy Reagan talked about it.
[00:17:38.691 --> 00:17:41.432]  Reagan was the president for about a year until they shot him.
[00:17:42.153 --> 00:17:46.076]  Then they gave him cold blood, caused brain damage, they drugged him up a bunch.
[00:17:46.616 --> 00:17:48.137]  He really never bounced back from that.
[00:17:48.758 --> 00:17:49.038]  Okay?
[00:17:50.539 --> 00:17:53.461]  Ronald Reagan sounded like Alex Jones before Alex Jones was around.
[00:17:53.601 --> 00:17:56.143]  He talked about the New World Order, the Trilateral Commission, the Globalist.
[00:17:56.223 --> 00:17:57.604]  He learned a lot from Barry Goldwater.
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:03.263]  And he was not going along with the stuff that George Herbert Walker Bush wanted, so they had him shot.
[00:18:03.924 --> 00:18:07.506]  And they had dinner with Hinckley's brother two nights before in Denver, Colorado.
[00:18:08.027 --> 00:18:08.888]  That's in the Denver Post.
[00:18:09.795 --> 00:18:11.536]  And so it's, and his dad was CIA.
[00:18:12.097 --> 00:18:16.980]  And so they literally, you know, took one for the team and had their, probably MKUltra's son.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.483]  Uh, that's a big thing the CIA did to most of their kids.
[00:18:21.043 --> 00:18:22.284]  And so that's what they did.
[00:18:22.324 --> 00:18:23.325]  And they sent that person in.
[00:18:23.925 --> 00:18:26.067]  So that's a fact, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:26.087 --> 00:18:29.009]  So we haven't had somebody that was president since about 1981.
[00:18:29.149 --> 00:18:35.734]  It's been a globalist operation and Trump got in because it was such a landslide.
[00:18:35.754 --> 00:18:36.935]  He had another big landslide.
[00:18:38.186 --> 00:18:42.167]  And they are trying to repudiate that landslide, and he is now our real president in exile.
[00:18:42.507 --> 00:18:44.747]  And I'm glad he set up this office of the former president.
[00:18:44.767 --> 00:18:46.528]  I mean, they all do that, but he's officially doing it.
[00:18:47.188 --> 00:18:53.769]  And so all of you again, and most of you aren't doing this, but all of you that are getting off on screw him, he could have done this better, he could have done that better.
[00:18:53.889 --> 00:18:54.709]  I'm going to explain something.
[00:18:55.589 --> 00:18:59.390]  If we let them hang Trump out to dry, do you think we're going to get other presidents that are willing to do this?
[00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:01.211]  Other congressmen that are willing to do this?
[00:19:01.531 --> 00:19:02.171]  Other senators?
[00:19:02.251 --> 00:19:02.771]  Other governors?
[00:19:03.965 --> 00:19:14.662]  If you turn and run, and don't support Trump now because he wasn't perfect, it sends a message to the next Bolsonaro, or the next whoever it is, that if you do this you get destroyed.
[00:19:14.983 --> 00:19:15.904]  That's the message to me.
[00:19:16.145 --> 00:19:18.128]  Jones, you either join us or you're destroyed.
[00:19:18.922 --> 00:19:20.563]  Well, I can't sign on to this satanism.
[00:19:20.983 --> 00:19:25.586]  If the globalists weren't corrupt and bad, and they were better than our system, I would adopt it and, you know, I would adopt it.
[00:19:25.606 --> 00:19:26.367]  I wouldn't sell out to it.
[00:19:26.827 --> 00:19:28.308]  I am not adopting their evil system.
[00:19:28.869 --> 00:19:29.889]  So I'm going to explain this again.
[00:19:29.909 --> 00:19:32.871]  People are like, why are you still supporting that piece of trash Trump?
[00:19:33.472 --> 00:19:34.793]  If they're able to destroy Trump,
[00:19:35.393 --> 00:19:38.554]  They're going to destroy everybody else, just like I told you three years ago when they banned me everywhere.
[00:19:38.974 --> 00:19:42.036]  I said, if Trump doesn't do this, by the election they're going to steal it.
[00:19:42.376 --> 00:19:45.837]  They're going to have an internet kill switch for all conservatives that's selective through their AI.
[00:19:46.077 --> 00:19:46.977]  Exactly that's been done.
[00:19:47.378 --> 00:19:49.999]  Go back to the last Joe Rogan interview, four days before the election.
[00:19:51.359 --> 00:19:52.279]  Four days before the election.
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:53.700]  He said, what's going to happen?
[00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:56.301]  I said, Trump's going to win in a landslide, and then they're going to steal it.
[00:19:57.455 --> 00:20:02.738]  And then Trump's going to contest it, and it's going to go to the Supreme Court, and I believe the Supreme Court will betray him.
[00:20:03.238 --> 00:20:04.158]  And they did.
[00:20:04.839 --> 00:20:05.699]  And they did.
[00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:07.180]  And they did.
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:21.347]  And then I saw the Supreme Court reshuffle justices over the appeals courts to accelerate the cases on like November 8th or whatever, and I thought, oh wow, oh maybe this means they're going to accelerate it because they know it's fraud.
[00:20:21.387 --> 00:20:24.549]  No, they accelerated it so they could kill all hope and shoot it down.
[00:20:26.792 --> 00:20:29.303]  So you're not the only ones that have false hopes sometimes.
[00:20:30.993 --> 00:20:31.594]  It gets dashed.
[00:20:31.634 --> 00:20:32.514]  I don't have all the answers.
[00:20:33.115 --> 00:20:35.016]  Owen Schroyer, what an epic time to be alive.
[00:20:35.036 --> 00:20:37.598]  I know you're going to be hosting the fourth hour of the third hour.
[00:20:37.618 --> 00:20:42.202]  You're also going to be hosting your own war room program that's really exploding in popularity 3 to 6 p.m.
[00:20:42.522 --> 00:20:44.023]  But there's so much to discuss.
[00:20:44.043 --> 00:20:45.184]  There's so much to talk about.
[00:20:45.624 --> 00:20:52.009]  I've got a John Bowne report dealing with the left claiming that we conservatives worship them and want to be them.
[00:20:52.069 --> 00:20:55.372]  It's very powerful and it really is total inversion of reality.
[00:20:55.412 --> 00:20:56.833]  But what else is on your radar today?
[00:20:56.853 --> 00:21:00.816]  I know you're looking forward to riding shotgun with me when we talk to the founder of the Boogaloos.
[00:21:01.756 --> 00:21:05.318]  Well, we've got the Democrats making moves just like we thought they would, Alex.
[00:21:05.358 --> 00:21:07.839]  They're talking about packing the Supreme Court.
[00:21:07.919 --> 00:21:10.501]  They're talking about adding D.C.
[00:21:10.661 --> 00:21:11.321]  as a state.
[00:21:11.381 --> 00:21:16.143]  You remember Obama said 57 states, which I guess was a misspeak at the time.
[00:21:16.223 --> 00:21:18.825]  Maybe he was just... Well, Puerto Rico, Guam, yeah, they want 57.
[00:21:19.525 --> 00:21:21.588]  Yeah, he was obviously just letting the cat out of the bag.
[00:21:21.608 --> 00:21:22.308]  So that's all coming on.
[00:21:22.328 --> 00:21:28.055]  They want to declare a climate emergency, but all kinds of different news, the triple mask, quadruple mask, put one on your ass.
[00:21:28.095 --> 00:21:29.297]  I mean, you know, it's all ridiculous.
[00:21:29.777 --> 00:21:37.186]  But you know, the one thing Alex, you mentioned about the office of the former president, it is ceremoniously done in the past, but I think that
[00:21:37.947 --> 00:21:43.974]  The reason why this is so significant is because this is going to be the first one that actually has any impact.
[00:21:44.294 --> 00:21:47.118]  Nobody really cares about what Obama has to say anymore.
[00:21:47.318 --> 00:21:48.279]  People can pretend they do.
[00:21:48.299 --> 00:21:48.940]  They really don't.
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:49.981]  His wife has a podcast.
[00:21:50.021 --> 00:21:50.561]  Nobody listens.
[00:21:50.622 --> 00:21:52.043]  Obama goes on TV and nobody cares.
[00:21:52.824 --> 00:21:54.625]  Trump does a YouTube video, gets 5 million views.
[00:21:54.705 --> 00:21:57.726]  Biden does one, it gets 5,000 and 98% downvotes.
[00:21:57.746 --> 00:22:03.369]  So that's why Trump can't have any platform because we can't see that he's more popular times 100 than Biden.
[00:22:03.429 --> 00:22:04.990]  That's why everybody must see.
[00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:05.650]  Here's the deal, guys.
[00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:07.731]  They don't just censor you so you can't talk.
[00:22:08.051 --> 00:22:11.473]  They censor you so they can speak for you and say what you said.
[00:22:11.973 --> 00:22:12.834]  This is so sick.
[00:22:12.894 --> 00:22:15.095]  He's on trial and he doesn't have a voice.
[00:22:15.115 --> 00:22:16.555]  And we're just going to put up with that crap?
[00:22:16.976 --> 00:22:17.556]  Sorry, I'm ranting.
[00:22:17.856 --> 00:22:24.419]  Well, and Alex, I mean, it's the old psychological thing with humans where you want to be on the winning team.
[00:22:24.479 --> 00:22:25.860]  So people don't see the censorship.
[00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:26.940]  They don't know Trump is censored.
[00:22:26.961 --> 00:22:28.341]  They just see, oh, Trump isn't anywhere.
[00:22:28.361 --> 00:22:29.342]  I just see Biden everywhere.
[00:22:29.382 --> 00:22:31.323]  Hollywood says Biden, so Biden must be popular.
[00:22:31.543 --> 00:22:34.464]  No, Trump is 5,000 more times popular than Biden.
[00:22:34.504 --> 00:22:35.205]  It's not even close.
[00:22:35.565 --> 00:22:41.508]  So now, whenever President Trump speaks out of his office of the former president, really, Trump is still the president.
[00:22:41.528 --> 00:22:42.468]  He was elected president.
[00:22:42.708 --> 00:22:44.069]  So it's going to have the same impact.
[00:22:44.489 --> 00:22:45.550]  As a president would have.
[00:22:45.931 --> 00:22:53.379]  And in practice, Alex, it may even be the same because, remember, he was trying to make things happen from the White House and nobody would obey.
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:54.801]  Nobody would do what he said.
[00:22:54.841 --> 00:23:00.287]  So he's basically going to have the same power of the bully pulpit out of Mar-a-Lago that he had in the White House.
[00:23:00.367 --> 00:23:00.648]  Exactly.
[00:23:00.708 --> 00:23:02.169]  And Trump needs to realize that.
[00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:06.733]  And we need to get that message to Trump, and we are getting that message to him, that he needs to go on the offense.
[00:23:06.993 --> 00:23:08.875]  He needs to demand to face his accusers.
[00:23:09.295 --> 00:23:11.117]  He needs to demand to be in that Senate trial.
[00:23:11.357 --> 00:23:13.679]  He needs to make it three weeks long, a month long.
[00:23:13.999 --> 00:23:15.580]  Suck all the oxygen out of Biden.
[00:23:16.201 --> 00:23:19.143]  And I hate to even say all this on air, but this is the advice I've actually gotten the President.
[00:23:19.183 --> 00:23:19.724]  I'll leave it at that.
[00:23:20.304 --> 00:23:22.606]  He needs to just demand.
[00:23:22.886 --> 00:23:25.328]  Because, I mean, in a real trial, he could have a two-month trial.
[00:23:25.788 --> 00:23:31.973]  And Trump just needs to dominate, suck all the air out of Biden, and he can literally turn this whole thing around against him if he doesn't.
[00:23:32.694 --> 00:23:34.855]  Well, and I'm just wondering again what they're going to do.
[00:23:34.875 --> 00:23:36.195]  I mean, Biden couldn't even... Biden vs. the pen yesterday.
[00:23:36.215 --> 00:23:37.775]  I don't know if you saw that.
[00:23:37.795 --> 00:23:38.815]  So Biden is slipping fast, Alex.
[00:23:38.875 --> 00:23:39.356]  Slipping fast.
[00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:04.050]  Absolutely.
[00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:05.730]  Let's go to break and come back and show.
[00:24:06.011 --> 00:24:08.411]  Let's do Biden in the pen last segment of this hour.
[00:24:08.491 --> 00:24:11.432]  Plus, I know something special is coming up with you, Owen, last segment of this hour.
[00:24:12.652 --> 00:24:18.353]  You're going to put it to the test with an oxygen reader and show people what it's like to wear three masks.
[00:24:18.413 --> 00:24:21.574]  I mean, my God, this is literally killing people now.
[00:24:22.354 --> 00:24:25.115]  Crashing the lies and disinformation.
[00:24:26.055 --> 00:24:26.995]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:24:29.585 --> 00:24:34.809]  All right, we've got some really big Proud Boy news that's gonna be breaking next segment, but I'll get to it then.
[00:24:35.369 --> 00:24:38.051]  I wanna cover this very important topic right now.
[00:24:40.453 --> 00:24:41.734]  The left is not creative.
[00:24:42.194 --> 00:24:43.815]  The left-hand path is destructive.
[00:24:44.636 --> 00:24:57.706]  And if you go back to ancient secret societies over 4,000 years ago, when we first read about the left-hand path in Egyptian hieroglyphs, the left-hand path is seen as the sinister or the destructive or the not trustworthy.
[00:24:58.433 --> 00:24:59.174]  And also the hidden.
[00:24:59.955 --> 00:25:03.198]  Because you expect the knife to come from the right hand, not from the left hand.
[00:25:04.339 --> 00:25:06.461]  So the left hand is associated with bad luck.
[00:25:06.541 --> 00:25:07.582]  The list just goes on and on.
[00:25:08.396 --> 00:25:15.201]  And then you have the Jacobins who obviously then took over France and killed hundreds of thousands of people.
[00:25:15.522 --> 00:25:17.043]  They weren't going after the elite, actually.
[00:25:17.363 --> 00:25:25.890]  They were going after the middle class, the farmers, and some of the smaller landowners because they actually wanted to set up a society where there were no more families based on Satanism.
[00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:30.834]  And now you'll notice the Young Turks have changed their name to the Jacobins.
[00:25:31.995 --> 00:25:32.416]  I think?
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:48.141]  Remember, nobody told you about Jacobins but me.
[00:25:48.761 --> 00:25:50.301]  And Lord Monckton, because he's a historian.
[00:25:50.321 --> 00:25:54.563]  And I'm not bragging, I'm saying, if you don't know who you're up against, you don't have any hope.
[00:25:54.803 --> 00:25:58.564]  This is a 4,000-year-old Egyptian death cult secret society.
[00:25:59.084 --> 00:26:00.565]  Okay, that's where all this crap comes from.
[00:26:00.585 --> 00:26:03.305]  It's where all the rappers tell you all the Egyptian stuff.
[00:26:03.526 --> 00:26:05.106]  They're not actually in the secret society.
[00:26:05.646 --> 00:26:07.287]  They just know that's where the power's at.
[00:26:08.507 --> 00:26:10.728]  But you get to the highest levels of the globalists, look at
[00:26:11.681 --> 00:26:15.343]  Epstein's Island, all that Egyptian temple stuff and Egyptian gods.
[00:26:15.784 --> 00:26:17.064]  That's what this is, okay?
[00:26:18.665 --> 00:26:19.446]  Now, why do I mention that?
[00:26:19.506 --> 00:26:20.547]  Joy Reid came out.
[00:26:20.567 --> 00:26:22.688]  We're going to play this very special report.
[00:26:22.928 --> 00:26:25.149]  We'll put it up on screen for TV viewers so they can see the title.
[00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:29.412]  Nobody is jealous of the left's culture of death.
[00:26:30.212 --> 00:26:33.955]  She and other Democrats in this tape say, in this compilation,
[00:26:35.234 --> 00:26:43.280]  In the John Bowne section of Band Off Video, that we are jealous of their culture, of their beauty, of how incredible they are, and that we're jealous of minorities.
[00:26:43.921 --> 00:26:47.764]  So white people aren't just racist and evil, they're jealous of black people.
[00:26:49.045 --> 00:26:55.209]  I mean, this is just the most racist, bizarre, crazy stuff, but the left is actually jealous of Americana culture.
[00:26:55.289 --> 00:26:58.252]  The left is jealous of not controlling Christian culture.
[00:26:59.383 --> 00:27:01.966]  The left wants to control the sex of your children.
[00:27:02.687 --> 00:27:08.373]  They own a relationship to talk about how your child should think sexually before you ever even talk to them when they're age 5.
[00:27:09.234 --> 00:27:20.866]  These are sick, evil control freaks that represent this satanic order that wants to play God and wants to take over the very genetic code, again back to Egypt, of the twin serpents, the double helix.
[00:27:21.707 --> 00:27:27.716]  So they were given very advanced knowledge by the bad guy, the fallen one, and that's what they believe they're carrying out.
[00:27:27.756 --> 00:27:34.385]  You can see they've built this to a certain point now to basically finish their mission of depopulation.
[00:27:34.425 --> 00:27:35.667]  So, no joy.
[00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:39.272]  We are not enamored with you.
[00:27:39.292 --> 00:27:41.234]  That's why Hollywood's ratings are down about half.
[00:27:41.734 --> 00:27:43.996]  Once you took the NFL over, ratings are down by about half.
[00:27:44.296 --> 00:27:45.978]  Everything you touch, people run from.
[00:27:46.278 --> 00:27:50.521]  The NBA, all of the blue cities and blue states, everyone's racing out of them.
[00:27:50.842 --> 00:27:53.724]  The blue states and blue cities under the UN are doing the global lockdown.
[00:27:54.124 --> 00:27:54.925]  You are the plague.
[00:27:55.085 --> 00:27:55.786]  You are the curse.
[00:27:56.086 --> 00:27:57.327]  We are not envying you.
[00:27:57.567 --> 00:27:58.588]  Here is the John Bowne Report.
[00:27:59.315 --> 00:28:07.066]  The pigs-in-a-blanket, prime-like-bacon lie about Black Lives Matter has been galling me since the people on the right started throwing it out there.
[00:28:07.768 --> 00:28:11.132]  Why is the president calling Black Lives Matter a symbol of hate?
[00:28:11.707 --> 00:28:25.550]  Well, what the president was noting is that that symbol, when you look at some of the things that have been chanted by Black Lives Matter, like pigs in a blanket, fry them like bacon, that's not an acceptable phrase to paint on our streets.
[00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:35.253]  There is absolutely zero, none, zero evidence that Black Lives Matter has ever pushed for anything violent, pushed for anything violent to happen to police.
[00:28:35.273 --> 00:28:36.933]  Pigs in a blanket!
[00:28:38.351 --> 00:28:41.475]  What some may find offensive is also free speech.
[00:28:41.876 --> 00:28:48.285]  What's ironic here is that marchers were being protected by the very officers targeted in the chant.
[00:28:48.546 --> 00:28:50.448]  Statements and chants like that are just ignorant.
[00:28:50.769 --> 00:28:52.652]  You know, I find it absolutely disgusting.
[00:28:59.577 --> 00:29:14.601]  As arrogant and jaded as the left's premier conspiracy theorist is, Joy Reid has haphazardly brought up a major issue that has been pushed into the background due to the paralysis of the state of American culture.
[00:29:14.961 --> 00:29:19.663]  Jack and company have now permanently suspended Trump's Twitter account.
[00:29:19.923 --> 00:29:28.647]  Finally accomplishing something three wives, multiple legal people who are suing him, and his entire White House staff have failed to do.
[00:29:29.387 --> 00:29:31.728]  Shutting him the hell up.
[00:29:32.208 --> 00:29:40.636]  Proving that we no longer live in a free country where any topic is fair game for criticism protected by our First Amendment.
[00:29:40.736 --> 00:29:50.326]  But even more dangerous is that Reid's arrogant claims are marinated in the progressive opinion that American culture is split in half.
[00:29:50.926 --> 00:29:55.369]  President Biden seems to understand that right-wing radicalization is a real problem.
[00:29:55.869 --> 00:30:04.975]  His team seems to recognize how Fox and Facebook and QAnon fantasies and all of that has caused the separate realities in the United States.
[00:30:05.615 --> 00:30:11.679]  He said in his inaugural address that he understands many of his fellow Americans view the future with fear and trepidation.
[00:30:12.159 --> 00:30:16.021]  And again, that's partly because of all the nonsense that's heard every night in prime time over there.
[00:30:16.642 --> 00:30:18.123]  Unity is impossible, okay?
[00:30:18.863 --> 00:30:24.286]  The United States is living in this parallel, there's parallel universes within the United States.
[00:30:25.327 --> 00:30:26.307]  Unity is not feasible.
[00:30:26.748 --> 00:30:27.268]  It's just not.
[00:30:27.848 --> 00:30:39.515]  This growing schism celebrated by the pundits of neoliberal social influence is a cancerous phenomenon that intends to accelerate the balkanization of America.
[00:30:39.943 --> 00:30:46.509]  Well, 75% of Republicans agree with you because they were fed a big lie by President Trump and his supporters who say the election was stolen.
[00:30:46.589 --> 00:30:48.851]  Why can't you say President Biden won a legitimate fair election?
[00:30:48.871 --> 00:30:51.113]  Well, I think where you make a mistake is that
[00:30:55.017 --> 00:31:01.359]  People coming from the liberal side like you, you immediately say everything's a lie instead of saying there are two sides to everything.
[00:31:01.799 --> 00:31:07.000]  Historically, what would happen is if I said that I thought there was fraud, you would interview someone else who said there wasn't.
[00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:11.901]  But now you insert yourself in the middle and say the absolute fact is that everything I'm saying is a lie.
[00:31:12.041 --> 00:31:16.082]  Well, Senator, I said what the President said was a lie because he said, hold on a second.
[00:31:16.102 --> 00:31:17.522]  He said the election was stolen.
[00:31:17.782 --> 00:31:19.203]  This election was not stolen.
[00:31:19.783 --> 00:31:24.044]  The results were certified in every single state after counts and recounts.
[00:31:24.124 --> 00:31:28.249]  You're saying there was no fraud and it's all been investigated.
[00:31:28.289 --> 00:31:29.110]  That's just not true.
[00:31:29.130 --> 00:31:30.692]  That's not what I said, sir.
[00:31:30.812 --> 00:31:32.914]  I said the Department of Justice found no evidence.
[00:31:33.075 --> 00:31:34.056]  Let me finish my point.
[00:31:34.096 --> 00:31:35.498]  You said something that was not true.
[00:31:35.538 --> 00:31:36.939]  You say we're all liars.
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:39.042]  You're just simply saying we're all liars.
[00:31:39.382 --> 00:31:41.805]  I said it was a lie that the election was stolen.
[00:31:41.825 --> 00:31:43.026]  That you're right and we're wrong.
[00:31:43.587 --> 00:31:46.169]  Well, let's talk about the specifics of it.
[00:31:46.289 --> 00:31:51.814]  In Wisconsin, tens of thousands of absentee votes had only the name on them and no address.
[00:31:52.114 --> 00:31:53.535]  Historically, those were thrown out.
[00:31:53.575 --> 00:31:54.456]  This time, they weren't.
[00:31:54.796 --> 00:31:59.680]  They made special accommodations because they said, oh, it's a pandemic, and people forgot what their address was.
[00:31:59.981 --> 00:32:02.062]  So they changed the law after the fact.
[00:32:02.342 --> 00:32:03.123]  That is wrong.
[00:32:03.163 --> 00:32:04.264]  That's unconstitutional.
[00:32:04.564 --> 00:32:09.348]  And I plan on spending the next two years going around state to state and fixing these problems.
[00:32:09.408 --> 00:32:11.290]  And I won't be cowed by liberals.
[00:32:11.670 --> 00:32:15.673]  In the media who say, there's no evidence here and you're a liar if you talk about election fraud.
[00:32:15.953 --> 00:32:17.414]  No, let's have an open debate.
[00:32:17.454 --> 00:32:18.395]  It's a free country.
[00:32:18.975 --> 00:32:31.824]  Adding to Reed's absurdity is her assumption that the supposed and imagined boogeyman she describes as the right is jealous of the far more talented and accomplished left.
[00:32:32.284 --> 00:32:38.609]  The thing the right hates the most about Democrats is that Democrats have the culture.
[00:32:39.741 --> 00:32:41.021]  Democrats have the culture.
[00:32:41.302 --> 00:32:42.702]  They have the Hollywood culture.
[00:32:42.962 --> 00:32:44.623]  They have the glamorous culture.
[00:32:44.883 --> 00:32:46.403]  And the right hates that.
[00:32:46.863 --> 00:32:48.784]  They feel that the culture is too woke.
[00:32:49.164 --> 00:32:50.645]  It's too multicultural.
[00:32:51.025 --> 00:32:52.725]  It's not John Wayne anymore.
[00:32:53.045 --> 00:32:57.287]  There's all of this multiculturalism and wokeness and liberalism and they hate it!
[00:32:58.047 --> 00:32:59.468]  But they also envy it.
[00:32:59.968 --> 00:33:01.589]  They also wish they had it.
[00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:07.033]  And they hate the fact that after Ronald Reagan, they no longer have a claim to the culture.
[00:33:07.153 --> 00:33:09.174]  They want the culture more than they want the politics.
[00:33:09.274 --> 00:33:10.855]  So they censor us and then say we want them.
[00:33:10.915 --> 00:33:23.964]  ...largely become a voice for the left's globalist totalitarian narrative of humanity's demise via predictive programming, a once shining inventive industry of American exceptionalism,
[00:33:24.184 --> 00:33:27.845]  Has become a tortured, addled shell of its former self.
[00:33:28.105 --> 00:33:36.168]  Inhabited by self-serving plastic egomaniacs with a fraction of the talent compared to... Alright folks, this is one of Jon Bowne's longer reports.
[00:33:36.188 --> 00:33:37.889]  The full report is at band.video.
[00:33:37.909 --> 00:33:38.749]  It really needs to get out.
[00:33:39.269 --> 00:33:41.270]  Nobody is jealous of the left's culture of death.
[00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:42.590]  The last few minutes are really powerful.
[00:33:42.610 --> 00:33:43.251]  I hope you'll share it.
[00:33:43.771 --> 00:33:48.733]  Alright, coming up... Well, it's been reported Proud Boys leader was prolific and former for law enforcement.
[00:33:48.753 --> 00:33:51.113]  I'm telling you, almost all these groups are led by feds.
[00:33:51.354 --> 00:33:51.974]  We'll be right back.
[00:33:51.994 --> 00:33:52.374]  Stay with us.
[00:33:53.513 --> 00:33:54.054]  Welcome back.
[00:33:54.174 --> 00:33:58.883]  I am your host, Alex Jones, coming to you from the beautiful mountains of Utah.
[00:34:00.165 --> 00:34:02.108]  And we have Owen Shorter back in the ATX in Austin.
[00:34:02.168 --> 00:34:02.850]  Big announcements.
[00:34:03.330 --> 00:34:03.831]  Hey, did you hear?
[00:34:04.012 --> 00:34:04.212]  Merc!
[00:34:05.296 --> 00:34:09.257]  Has pulled its two vaccines because of major health problems and bad reactions.
[00:34:09.957 --> 00:34:15.819]  Both their mRNA vaccine and their regular vaccine that had a bizarre measles delivery system.
[00:34:16.279 --> 00:34:22.801]  Those have been pulled and they say it doesn't work and it's dangerous and you shouldn't take a vaccine because they know the house of cards is coming down.
[00:34:23.442 --> 00:34:28.043]  We also have all these deaths of 20 year olds, 50 year olds, 75 year olds, 80 year olds.
[00:34:28.703 --> 00:34:31.084]  It goes on and on and on but don't worry.
[00:34:31.764 --> 00:34:35.967]  Fauci told you 2.4 million Americans would be dead within the first three months last year.
[00:34:35.987 --> 00:34:37.569]  I remember he said that in March.
[00:34:37.589 --> 00:34:40.191]  He said within three months there'll be 2.4 million dead.
[00:34:40.211 --> 00:34:42.513]  Other models said 2.5 million, 2.2 million.
[00:34:42.833 --> 00:34:43.914]  All funded by Bill Gates.
[00:34:44.734 --> 00:34:46.916]  The British model, the German model, and the U.S.
[00:34:46.956 --> 00:34:47.176]  model.
[00:34:47.256 --> 00:34:48.317]  All funded by the same guy.
[00:34:48.557 --> 00:34:51.420]  You wonder why Bill Gates declares, you'll never be unlocked down.
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:52.481]  You'll never shake hands.
[00:34:52.501 --> 00:34:53.341]  You'll never stop wearing masks.
[00:34:53.361 --> 00:34:54.922]  You're like, why is this guy in charge?
[00:34:54.962 --> 00:34:55.243]  Because
[00:34:56.618 --> 00:34:59.459]  He heads up the major eugenics board that controls everything.
[00:34:59.479 --> 00:35:02.841]  And he's back in the news today saying people are being so mean to him.
[00:35:02.901 --> 00:35:07.684]  And he doesn't know why they think there's a plan to put microchips in you to make sure you've been vaccinated.
[00:35:08.104 --> 00:35:19.369]  I mean, we only have MIT and Rice University saying in documentaries from two years ago that Bill Gates is funding nanotech in the vaccines to prove that you've had the vaccine.
[00:35:20.110 --> 00:35:21.430]  But again, it doesn't matter.
[00:35:22.471 --> 00:35:26.093]  It's kind of like what Paul Watson pointed out yesterday when he hosted The Fourth Hour, did a splendid job.
[00:35:27.725 --> 00:35:39.471]  You have Klaus Schwab announcing Great Reset, World Government, New World Order, all of this, and saying COVID's not really a threat, but we're using this to cut the carbon footprint and bring in a technocracy to save the Earth.
[00:35:39.991 --> 00:35:42.573]  The New York Times says the Great Reset doesn't exist.
[00:35:42.633 --> 00:35:42.933]  It's like...
[00:35:43.865 --> 00:35:46.385]  It's like telling your four-year-old, and they go, where'd grandma go?
[00:35:46.405 --> 00:35:47.726]  Oh, she went on to a better place.
[00:35:48.106 --> 00:35:48.846]  Well, what's dead?
[00:35:48.866 --> 00:35:50.166]  Well, don't worry about that right now.
[00:35:50.526 --> 00:35:51.486]  Death doesn't exist.
[00:35:52.067 --> 00:35:53.627]  Like, where'd the goldfish go?
[00:35:54.087 --> 00:36:01.348]  Well, Spot, or Orange, or Fluffy, whatever the fish's name is, Fluffy's gone to heaven.
[00:36:01.388 --> 00:36:02.969]  No, Fluffy got flushed down the toilet.
[00:36:04.169 --> 00:36:08.970]  So, they talk to you like you're idiots, and we can never have a real debate about what's going on.
[00:36:09.989 --> 00:36:14.054]  So, they put flora in the water for decades, knowing it lowered your IQ and lower fertility.
[00:36:14.094 --> 00:36:16.878]  Now, Harvard studies admit that, but still they put it in your water.
[00:36:17.479 --> 00:36:23.266]  It's all about waging war on the general population, stunning you, dumbing you down so they can control you and control the future.
[00:36:23.526 --> 00:36:24.548]  It's about selfishness.
[00:36:24.888 --> 00:36:25.749]  It's about playing God.
[00:36:27.639 --> 00:36:30.381]  They have now announced that it's not enough to kill Hank Aaron.
[00:36:31.061 --> 00:36:34.204]  Now they want everyone to wear two masks, Fauci said yesterday.
[00:36:34.244 --> 00:36:38.107]  So to make him look reasonable, CNBC and others said, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:36:38.667 --> 00:36:39.588]  We need three masks.
[00:36:39.628 --> 00:36:40.808]  Some are saying four masks.
[00:36:41.169 --> 00:36:44.071]  Only four masks, they're saying, is 99% effective.
[00:36:44.591 --> 00:36:50.856]  So they're now admitting that even the so-called surgical mask and, you know, all the rest of it, don't protect you.
[00:36:50.876 --> 00:36:53.598]  Of course they don't, because the virus is small and goes right through it.
[00:36:54.018 --> 00:36:55.199]  What helps you is nutrition.
[00:36:55.519 --> 00:36:56.580]  Turns out Rendezivir,
[00:36:57.967 --> 00:36:58.888]  Is 100% effective.
[00:36:59.048 --> 00:37:00.069]  That's why the media doesn't want it.
[00:37:01.311 --> 00:37:03.513]  There's so many things that are 100% effective, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:03.894 --> 00:37:07.177]  But if you don't have vitamin D, you'll 100% die within about six months.
[00:37:07.658 --> 00:37:08.939]  But they want you to stay ignorant.
[00:37:08.959 --> 00:37:11.242]  So they've announced the daily COVID briefings are back.
[00:37:11.382 --> 00:37:12.483]  It's not going away.
[00:37:12.943 --> 00:37:15.206]  It's going to get worse because Bill Gates said it would.
[00:37:15.907 --> 00:37:16.247]  And so...
[00:37:17.248 --> 00:37:23.272]  We now take you to Owen Troyer, a dirty human that needs to cover his face in public, needs to cover his dirtiness.
[00:37:23.573 --> 00:37:24.613]  He's a bad person.
[00:37:24.954 --> 00:37:29.777]  All the real studies show that when you are around other people with germs, you share the germs, you have a better immunity.
[00:37:30.117 --> 00:37:30.297]  No.
[00:37:30.718 --> 00:37:31.698]  I want to see him on camera.
[00:37:31.979 --> 00:37:33.239]  Show me the dirty human right now.
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:34.420]  Zoom in on him.
[00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:34.921]  Close shot.
[00:37:36.402 --> 00:37:39.244]  I want people to see a dirty, evil human.
[00:37:40.319 --> 00:37:41.320]  Do we not have a close shot?
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:41.961]  I asked for one.
[00:37:42.141 --> 00:37:46.907]  I need a close shot on this filthy, dirty scumbag.
[00:37:46.987 --> 00:37:47.327]  More.
[00:37:47.868 --> 00:37:48.208]  More.
[00:37:48.789 --> 00:37:51.852]  Look at him, not covering his face, letting disease come out.
[00:37:52.193 --> 00:37:57.719]  Why, if he gets with a woman and gets married, he might create more of these damn things and eat up the resources of our globalist planet.
[00:37:58.240 --> 00:37:58.740]  So, Owen.
[00:37:59.895 --> 00:38:01.357]  Fauci says wear two masks.
[00:38:01.637 --> 00:38:09.285]  I know that one mask lowers oxygen 15 to 20 percent and increases carbon dioxide or carbon, yes, carbon dioxide and monoxide that's already a trace gas.
[00:38:09.786 --> 00:38:13.931]  I want to see you, you filth bag, put on your mask, okay?
[00:38:13.971 --> 00:38:18.656]  Now, first admit to everybody you apologize for being human and that you admit you're scum and you're going to submit.
[00:38:20.245 --> 00:38:21.186]  Sorry, I'm sorry.
[00:38:21.206 --> 00:38:32.832]  I'm a dirty, I'm a dirty human and I can spread asymptomatically diseases that I don't have and I'm sorry for being... Oh and did you hear about the more, oh there's the Brazilian and the UK strain.
[00:38:33.032 --> 00:38:34.353]  Have you heard, are you scared of that?
[00:38:34.793 --> 00:38:47.620]  Yeah, Fauci said I should be really scared that it's even more deadly, that it might, you might only have a 99.8 survival rate with this strain, so... If you're above 85, yeah, if you're younger you can't die from it, absolutely.
[00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:48.381]  So, so right now...
[00:38:49.201 --> 00:38:50.221]  Put on the first mask.
[00:38:50.261 --> 00:38:51.162]  Let's breathe oil.
[00:38:51.362 --> 00:38:53.763]  Take a reading of carbon dioxide first.
[00:38:53.783 --> 00:38:57.804]  Take the reading to show people the reading first while you're openly dirty breathing dirty human.
[00:38:58.885 --> 00:38:59.545]  Let's get a breathing.
[00:38:59.565 --> 00:39:01.906]  This has been live in studio all day.
[00:39:01.926 --> 00:39:02.726]  All right.
[00:39:02.786 --> 00:39:03.647]  It hasn't gone off.
[00:39:03.727 --> 00:39:07.168]  It's been going on somewhere between 580 and 620 here.
[00:39:07.948 --> 00:39:10.229]  Parts per million there with the carbon dioxide.
[00:39:12.776 --> 00:39:14.777]  You know what, I'm going to have to increase those levels.
[00:39:14.817 --> 00:39:17.098]  I've been told it's good for me by the global government.
[00:39:17.438 --> 00:39:20.120]  That's right, so you put on your mask and then we'll take a reading.
[00:39:22.161 --> 00:39:22.721]  You want me to?
[00:39:22.961 --> 00:39:24.242]  How many should I wear, boss?
[00:39:25.622 --> 00:39:36.408]  Well, just breathe for a while and then, yeah, let's put on... Let's stick that sensor underneath that ugly face covering.
[00:39:36.448 --> 00:39:37.208]  Which is the one?
[00:39:37.228 --> 00:39:37.948]  Your little burka.
[00:39:38.929 --> 00:39:40.990]  Didn't know you'd suddenly be under Islam, did you?
[00:39:41.724 --> 00:39:42.585]  Alright, I've got one mask on.
[00:39:42.605 --> 00:39:44.766]  Year under Islam, you dirty, filthy American.
[00:39:44.786 --> 00:39:47.528]  Cover that dirty piehole face of yours.
[00:39:47.989 --> 00:39:50.030]  Alright, I've got one mask on right now, Alex.
[00:39:50.490 --> 00:39:53.312]  And I'm trying to get it airtight so I don't get any of the COVIDs.
[00:39:54.273 --> 00:39:55.034]  And don't worry.
[00:39:55.534 --> 00:39:57.595]  Don't worry about this meter if it starts to go... Oh!
[00:39:58.236 --> 00:39:58.856]  Oh, there it goes.
[00:39:59.817 --> 00:40:01.498]  Oh, carbon dioxide's going way up.
[00:40:02.119 --> 00:40:02.579]  Danger.
[00:40:03.019 --> 00:40:03.440]  Danger.
[00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:04.280]  Well, that's alright.
[00:40:04.681 --> 00:40:07.683]  At least I'm stopping COVID though, Alex.
[00:40:08.988 --> 00:40:11.210]  Hey, but not to mention... Oh, and it gets better.
[00:40:12.090 --> 00:40:15.893]  Not to mention, you also... It causes massive bacterial pneumonia.
[00:40:16.714 --> 00:40:18.536]  And they admit that's causing more death, but that's okay.
[00:40:18.556 --> 00:40:20.177]  Go ahead and put your sensor back down.
[00:40:20.397 --> 00:40:20.717]  Okay.
[00:40:21.878 --> 00:40:22.859]  So it's already dropped a bunch.
[00:40:22.899 --> 00:40:25.141]  Now let's... Now one is not enough.
[00:40:25.181 --> 00:40:26.362]  We need inspections of this.
[00:40:26.762 --> 00:40:27.362]  Oh, by the way, the...
[00:40:28.871 --> 00:40:29.952]  The China is the model.
[00:40:29.992 --> 00:40:30.552]  They're the heroes.
[00:40:30.572 --> 00:40:37.276]  They've announced now checkpoints with anal probes, where they're now going to do anal probes in vans to test to see if you have COVID.
[00:40:37.296 --> 00:40:39.177]  They say that the PCR test isn't valid.
[00:40:39.237 --> 00:40:39.557]  Oh, really?
[00:40:39.577 --> 00:40:40.077]  We already knew that.
[00:40:40.517 --> 00:40:45.880]  So, Owen, so we're going to have mask checkpoints are now announcing in the UK and anal probes.
[00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:47.281]  We've got to do what Gigi Ping does.
[00:40:47.301 --> 00:40:48.241]  We've got to humiliate you better.
[00:40:48.582 --> 00:40:49.422]  That's two masks now.
[00:40:49.442 --> 00:40:50.022]  Is that two masks?
[00:40:50.183 --> 00:40:51.163]  Yeah, I've got two masks on.
[00:40:51.183 --> 00:40:51.763]  Do you want me to get it?
[00:40:51.863 --> 00:40:52.784]  I can go more, Alex.
[00:40:54.105 --> 00:40:57.226]  Yeah, I guess it's picking up so much carbon dioxide right now, it's going up before it's even by your face.
[00:40:57.266 --> 00:40:58.307]  Yeah, go ahead and put it back under there.
[00:40:59.138 --> 00:40:59.898]  How much has it dropped?
[00:40:59.998 --> 00:41:00.499]  Okay, oh!
[00:41:01.699 --> 00:41:02.760]  An InfoWars mask.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:03.460]  Here, let's go.
[00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:04.800]  If you gotta wear one, might as well fight back.
[00:41:06.101 --> 00:41:08.442]  I can reset it if you want, or we can put it back under.
[00:41:08.462 --> 00:41:10.643]  Well, how much did it drop?
[00:41:11.643 --> 00:41:12.584]  It's still dropping now.
[00:41:12.604 --> 00:41:15.645]  It got up to almost 5,000 parts per million.
[00:41:15.825 --> 00:41:17.786]  It's slowly dropping right now.
[00:41:18.286 --> 00:41:20.287]  Well, let's just stick it back up under there.
[00:41:20.327 --> 00:41:21.107]  That's three masks.
[00:41:21.587 --> 00:41:24.889]  Owen is now doing what CNBC says you should do.
[00:41:24.929 --> 00:41:25.549]  Three masks.
[00:41:25.789 --> 00:41:27.430]  Back underneath the ugly pie hole.
[00:41:28.613 --> 00:41:30.594]  Stick it under there, the covering where the dirty hole is.
[00:41:30.614 --> 00:41:31.415]  Alright, alright, man.
[00:41:31.435 --> 00:41:34.957]  Cover up that, it's like a big, gaping... Well, you know what they call those.
[00:41:35.357 --> 00:41:35.997]  I can't even do that.
[00:41:36.017 --> 00:41:37.358]  Cover up that filthy rat hole.
[00:41:37.378 --> 00:41:37.978]  Alright, here we go.
[00:41:38.098 --> 00:41:39.319]  You filthy, dirty American.
[00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:40.070]  Alright.
[00:41:40.490 --> 00:41:41.431]  Okay, good.
[00:41:41.451 --> 00:41:44.812]  Now let's hear about all that brain-damaging carbon dioxide you're breathing.
[00:41:44.832 --> 00:41:45.772]  Oh, you filthy pig.
[00:41:45.792 --> 00:41:46.793]  Alright, here we go.
[00:41:47.573 --> 00:41:48.834]  You dirty carbon unit.
[00:41:48.894 --> 00:41:51.054]  We gotta cut all carbon, including all humans, Bill Gates said.
[00:41:51.075 --> 00:41:52.035]  Yeah, but I'm stopping at least.
[00:41:52.055 --> 00:41:53.796]  Oh, look at that carbon dioxide surging.
[00:41:54.196 --> 00:41:55.056]  Oxygen plummeting.
[00:41:55.536 --> 00:41:55.996]  Yes!
[00:41:56.056 --> 00:41:57.217]  We have brain damage!
[00:41:58.658 --> 00:41:59.078]  Victory!
[00:41:59.258 --> 00:42:00.958]  God, there's nothing they won't submit to!
[00:42:02.539 --> 00:42:03.479]  Barrett has ours!
[00:42:03.599 --> 00:42:03.980]  God!
[00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:04.660]  G.G.P.
[00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:05.660]  is in control!
[00:42:08.174 --> 00:42:10.354]  That's a dangerous level of carbon dioxide I see there.
[00:42:10.474 --> 00:42:11.295]  Owen, give us the reading.
[00:42:12.815 --> 00:42:15.756]  Yeah, it's actually about to go off the charts it looks like here, Alex.
[00:42:15.796 --> 00:42:22.457]  This thing doesn't go higher than 9,999 parts per million, so I think we're about to go off the meter here, Alex.
[00:42:22.817 --> 00:42:23.377]  Yep, there it goes.
[00:42:23.397 --> 00:42:23.917]  So we're about to go.
[00:42:24.117 --> 00:42:24.757]  How you feeling?
[00:42:24.777 --> 00:42:26.298]  Do you feel like you're being suffocated?
[00:42:26.318 --> 00:42:31.919]  Yeah, I can honestly... Can we show the Godfather 2, uh, Godfather 2 smothering scene?
[00:42:31.939 --> 00:42:35.039]  Just type in Godfather 2, uh, smothering scene.
[00:42:35.559 --> 00:42:37.880]  Or Godfather 2 assassin scene, where the guys put the pillow.
[00:42:39.172 --> 00:42:49.941]  Yeah, I mean, this is probably how Steve, or excuse me, how Judge Scalia felt in his last moments, I would imagine, but... Or Jeffrey Epstein!
[00:42:50.061 --> 00:42:51.482]  I really cannot breathe in right now.
[00:42:51.502 --> 00:42:54.864]  I mean, it's like... I don't care, you're a terrorist, you're gonna wear at least three.
[00:42:54.924 --> 00:42:56.466]  Let's go further, put a fourth one on.
[00:42:57.206 --> 00:42:58.287]  Do it, or you're a terrorist.
[00:42:58.848 --> 00:43:01.209]  Or something, you wanna charge people with terrorism that don't wear more.
[00:43:01.590 --> 00:43:01.910]  More.
[00:43:02.591 --> 00:43:02.891]  More.
[00:43:04.164 --> 00:43:04.544]  More.
[00:43:05.085 --> 00:43:07.186]  That'll just pour like glue down your throat, Jim.
[00:43:07.487 --> 00:43:10.729]  Why don't you just kill yourself so you don't spread COVID, you dirty human?
[00:43:11.230 --> 00:43:11.770]  How's that feel?
[00:43:12.391 --> 00:43:15.293]  I think if I wear this long enough, Alex, you'll probably snuff me out.
[00:43:16.173 --> 00:43:17.575]  Okay, well that doesn't matter, terrorist.
[00:43:17.595 --> 00:43:18.315]  These are good for you.
[00:43:18.575 --> 00:43:21.378]  Put on a fifth one right now, you damn terrorist.
[00:43:26.201 --> 00:43:28.423]  No, that's Godfather 1 when they killed Luke Abrazi.
[00:43:28.703 --> 00:43:29.464]  That's good for him, too.
[00:43:29.664 --> 00:43:30.725]  He did that to stop COVID.
[00:43:30.925 --> 00:43:32.186]  No, no, no, show the pillow scene.
[00:43:32.206 --> 00:43:33.107]  It's good for you.
[00:43:37.182 --> 00:43:37.583]  More!
[00:43:38.524 --> 00:43:41.488]  Don't even... Hey, put the sensor under there, you dirty American!
[00:43:42.229 --> 00:43:42.469]  Get it?
[00:43:42.789 --> 00:43:46.454]  Radio listeners, we're at Infowars.com for a special video.
[00:43:46.675 --> 00:43:47.075]  More!
[00:43:47.636 --> 00:43:48.157]  More!
[00:43:48.557 --> 00:43:48.938]  More!
[00:43:50.239 --> 00:43:51.820]  More!
[00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:52.340]  More!
[00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:52.900]  You're dirty!
[00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:54.320]  I'm gonna die!
[00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:55.021]  More!
[00:43:55.201 --> 00:43:56.421]  You're gonna kill me!
[00:43:57.061 --> 00:43:58.102]  No, keep going!
[00:43:58.122 --> 00:44:00.602]  This doesn't hurt you to breathe more carbon dioxide.
[00:44:00.722 --> 00:44:02.123]  Doesn't hurt you to take poison vaccines.
[00:44:02.283 --> 00:44:03.383]  Doesn't hurt you to take fluoride.
[00:44:03.904 --> 00:44:05.064]  None GMO's good for you.
[00:44:05.264 --> 00:44:06.044]  5G's good for you.
[00:44:06.084 --> 00:44:06.544]  More!
[00:44:06.564 --> 00:44:07.325]  I can't breathe!
[00:44:07.365 --> 00:44:10.586]  Listen, you're fired if you don't put 10 more on you, dirty!
[00:44:10.606 --> 00:44:11.206]  I can't breathe!
[00:44:11.226 --> 00:44:11.966]  Phil, submit now!
[00:44:12.026 --> 00:44:12.906]  You're a terrorist!
[00:44:13.007 --> 00:44:14.247]  I can't even breathe!
[00:44:14.267 --> 00:44:15.207]  Yes, more!
[00:44:15.687 --> 00:44:17.148]  Get a noose, hang him, kill him!
[00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:23.007]  Now you're covered up like an Islamic woman in Saudi Arabia.
[00:44:23.388 --> 00:44:23.809]  Good!
[00:44:24.591 --> 00:44:26.776]  We'll be right back with our number two of the Boogaloos.
[00:44:27.694 --> 00:44:29.135]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:44:29.415 --> 00:44:35.978]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and if you just joined us, Owen the Dirty Human Schreuer is a bad carbon unit.
[00:44:36.118 --> 00:44:36.998]  All carbon is bad.
[00:44:37.118 --> 00:44:38.859]  Trees, plants, humans.
[00:44:38.879 --> 00:44:39.600]  We've got to tax it.
[00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:40.340]  We've got to control it.
[00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:42.021]  We've got to transcend the humans.
[00:44:42.541 --> 00:44:43.842]  Well, I wonder who runs these globalists.
[00:44:43.862 --> 00:44:45.242]  I mean, I'm not into UFOs and stuff.
[00:44:45.282 --> 00:44:48.204]  I just can think in a logical, linear way.
[00:44:48.284 --> 00:44:49.264]  They want to get rid of humans.
[00:44:49.664 --> 00:44:50.825]  They say the post-human world's here.
[00:44:52.143 --> 00:44:55.486]  The Bible says it's a fallen creature on the planet doing this to us, but whatever.
[00:44:55.506 --> 00:44:57.468]  Maybe we're pre-programmed to kill ourselves.
[00:44:57.528 --> 00:44:59.831]  I don't know, but Owen Schroyer, let's go back to you.
[00:45:00.791 --> 00:45:02.673]  When I wear one mask, I have trouble breathing.
[00:45:03.474 --> 00:45:04.635]  When I wear two, I tried it.
[00:45:04.675 --> 00:45:05.396]  It's suffocating.
[00:45:05.616 --> 00:45:07.097]  What was it like to wear six masks?
[00:45:07.137 --> 00:45:11.922]  You legitimately looked like you were panicking there a little bit, buddy, which I couldn't even do what you just did.
[00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:19.483]  I mean, honestly, I mean, you wear the one mask, you can still kind of get some airflow.
[00:45:20.063 --> 00:45:24.486]  But once you put on the second and the third, I mean, it's like you're sucking in.
[00:45:24.506 --> 00:45:25.127]  I mean, I don't know.
[00:45:25.167 --> 00:45:27.768]  It's like a vacuum that's like clogged or something.
[00:45:27.849 --> 00:45:28.989]  It's like you can't.
[00:45:29.189 --> 00:45:31.231]  I mean, they're really you have to really effort.
[00:45:31.271 --> 00:45:34.333]  It's like, I guess it would be like having, you know, asthma.
[00:45:34.593 --> 00:45:37.355]  They say if you want to know what it's like to have asthma, you suck air through a straw.
[00:45:37.715 --> 00:45:38.616]  You know, it's tough to breathe.
[00:45:38.996 --> 00:45:39.736]  So it's kind of like that.
[00:45:39.756 --> 00:45:42.959]  It's like the NXIVM cult and all this makes people wear masks and gags.
[00:45:43.279 --> 00:45:44.700]  They're all into being suffocated.
[00:45:45.441 --> 00:45:47.106]  Like, like, like, Carradine, all of them.
[00:45:47.387 --> 00:45:48.971]  Literally, this is a cult ritual, isn't it?
[00:45:49.798 --> 00:45:52.000]  No, I can't understand how people do this.
[00:45:52.060 --> 00:45:54.982]  I mean, I think that, you know, quite frankly, I'm so lucky.
[00:45:55.002 --> 00:45:57.843]  I mean, we're working with one of the last great American companies here at Infowars.
[00:45:57.883 --> 00:46:00.685]  We can still live free, have a gun, be mask-free.
[00:46:01.446 --> 00:46:04.548]  And I guess, you know, it's like, we can't even, I can't even relate.
[00:46:04.608 --> 00:46:06.949]  I mean, people sit there for eight hours.
[00:46:07.210 --> 00:46:09.711]  They'll wear a face mask for eight hours.
[00:46:09.951 --> 00:46:11.853]  And they have to wear the mask.
[00:46:11.893 --> 00:46:14.254]  They don't let them wear the handkerchief or whatever.
[00:46:14.875 --> 00:46:15.595]  It's the mask.
[00:46:16.036 --> 00:46:19.138]  And also, you know, I'm wondering too... It's also a cast thing, because...
[00:46:19.838 --> 00:46:25.383]  I like being doing tours of factories or other people's facilities and like none of the owners or CEOs are wearing them and everybody else is.
[00:46:25.423 --> 00:46:27.765]  It's like a, it's literally a caste thing.
[00:46:28.305 --> 00:46:37.553]  Well it is and that's why you see Biden and his family going to the Lincoln Memorial not wearing masks hours after he signs the executive order saying you must wear, you must wear a mask on federal property.
[00:46:37.573 --> 00:46:38.995]  By the way, did you see the press secretary?
[00:46:39.015 --> 00:46:41.537]  We ought to play that later after the Boogaloo commander comes on.
[00:46:41.557 --> 00:46:43.779]  The Boogaloo Lord, I'm sorry.
[00:46:46.964 --> 00:46:47.424]  What's her name?
[00:46:47.485 --> 00:46:47.905]  Sushi.
[00:46:47.925 --> 00:46:48.826]  That's her last name.
[00:46:48.926 --> 00:46:49.807]  The redhead Sushi.
[00:46:50.428 --> 00:46:52.270]  She says, well, that's not serious.
[00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:53.771]  Let's talk about important things.
[00:46:53.992 --> 00:46:58.196]  So him having an order that you gotta wear a mask illegally, that's important.
[00:46:58.216 --> 00:46:59.638]  But when he doesn't, he's important.
[00:46:59.858 --> 00:47:01.440]  She's telling you, oh, he's important.
[00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:03.022]  He doesn't wear a damn mask.
[00:47:03.547 --> 00:47:09.971]  And you can even find, I mean, again, the healthcare workers, people at grocery stores, wherever, they're wearing the mask eight straight hours.
[00:47:10.571 --> 00:47:16.655]  They are having, like, breakouts, and like, eczema, and like, disease, and all of this stuff.
[00:47:17.095 --> 00:47:18.896]  This is like a Pac-Man hand going on here.
[00:47:19.276 --> 00:47:20.337]  That's like the globalists, though.
[00:47:20.397 --> 00:47:22.858]  They're like the Pac-Man, just eating up all of our freedoms.
[00:47:22.878 --> 00:47:24.859]  Just nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.
[00:47:24.879 --> 00:47:26.360]  Just eating any freedom they can take.
[00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:27.441]  Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.
[00:47:28.376 --> 00:47:29.977]  And so they don't even want you to breathe, Alex.
[00:47:30.037 --> 00:47:31.357]  They're going to say breathing is illegal.
[00:47:31.677 --> 00:47:34.538]  You used to go on air 20 years ago, people probably thought you were crazy.
[00:47:34.938 --> 00:47:36.819]  Oh, they're going to say there's more than two genders.
[00:47:36.839 --> 00:47:40.700]  They're going to make man and woman and dad and mom illegal to say.
[00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:42.941]  They're going to stop you from even breathing.
[00:47:43.261 --> 00:47:44.362]  And that's where we've gotten to this point.
[00:47:44.382 --> 00:47:47.503]  In fact, Alex, if you want to play the clip, I had the crew grab it.
[00:47:47.523 --> 00:47:48.663]  We can play it back to back.
[00:47:48.723 --> 00:47:51.704]  Fauci on 60 Minutes saying, no point wearing a mask.
[00:47:51.764 --> 00:47:52.565]  It doesn't do anything.
[00:47:52.605 --> 00:47:53.325]  Don't wear the mask.
[00:47:53.545 --> 00:47:55.686]  Now he says, oh, wear three masks to stop COVID.
[00:47:56.146 --> 00:47:56.506]  Here it is.
[00:47:57.755 --> 00:47:59.143]  Right now, people should not be walking.
[00:47:59.163 --> 00:48:01.055]  There's no reason to be walking around with a mask.
[00:48:02.273 --> 00:48:11.639]  When you're in the middle of an outbreak, wearing a mask might make people feel a little bit better, and it might even block a droplet.
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:16.403]  But it's not providing the perfect protection that people think that it is.
[00:48:16.963 --> 00:48:20.425]  And often, there are unintended consequences.
[00:48:20.485 --> 00:48:23.427]  People keep fiddling with the mask, and they keep touching their face.
[00:48:23.948 --> 00:48:27.230]  And can you get some schmutz sort of staying inside there?
[00:48:27.250 --> 00:48:28.351]  Of course, of course.
[00:48:28.371 --> 00:48:31.893]  But when you think masks, you should think of health care providers needing them.
[00:48:37.237 --> 00:48:38.578]  Oh, now it's common sense.
[00:48:38.598 --> 00:48:41.621]  It's common sense to wear two masks, he says now.
[00:48:41.702 --> 00:48:44.324]  And also, you could pass it by farting.
[00:48:44.344 --> 00:48:45.586]  So, Fauci have a giant butt plug?
[00:48:45.666 --> 00:48:49.270]  It just makes common sense that it likely would be more effective.
[00:48:49.290 --> 00:48:53.574]  And that's the reason why you see people either double masking or doing a version.
[00:48:53.594 --> 00:48:57.038]  Yeah, but Alex, he wears the butt plug not for reasons to stop COVID.
[00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:00.721]  Well, Snopes should check that claim.
[00:49:01.121 --> 00:49:06.063]  InfoWars claims that Dr. Fauci has a butt plug the size of a fire hydrant to stop COVID.
[00:49:06.123 --> 00:49:10.024]  And if you don't put a giant butt plug in, I'm serious, you are helping spread COVID.
[00:49:10.384 --> 00:49:12.865]  So we need to now, I mean, China's coming with anal testing.
[00:49:13.086 --> 00:49:13.666]  Now it's going to be here.
[00:49:13.706 --> 00:49:14.406]  I'm not even joking.
[00:49:15.587 --> 00:49:21.449]  So, you go back to 1775 at Lexington and Concord where the war started.
[00:49:22.554 --> 00:49:25.354]  The British had already been tearing up their printing presses.
[00:49:25.374 --> 00:49:28.615]  They've been confiscating guns and ammo all over Boston.
[00:49:28.955 --> 00:49:32.336]  And the captain of the local militia said, we don't want a war.
[00:49:32.416 --> 00:49:33.156]  We don't want to fight.
[00:49:34.956 --> 00:49:37.837]  And we should not shoot first, but if they want a war, they're going to get one.
[00:49:39.337 --> 00:49:40.097]  And you know what happened?
[00:49:40.117 --> 00:49:42.037]  They ended up shooting him and killing him and the war started.
[00:49:42.677 --> 00:49:47.138]  And the British, a large part of their force got killed trying to get back to where they came from.
[00:49:47.258 --> 00:49:48.098]  And the rest is history.
[00:49:48.678 --> 00:49:51.479]  It looked like we lost the first five years of the war, but
[00:49:52.418 --> 00:49:54.599]  By perseverance, we ended up winning in the end.
[00:49:55.019 --> 00:49:59.000]  So resistance, when you're in the right, is victory.
[00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:00.220]  That's an Alex Jones quote.
[00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:01.220]  Resistance is victory.
[00:50:02.300 --> 00:50:03.721]  And laying down is slavery.
[00:50:03.841 --> 00:50:06.982]  I think those are easy, galactic, common law things.
[00:50:08.222 --> 00:50:09.902]  And so I believe in the Declaration of Independence.
[00:50:09.942 --> 00:50:21.125]  I believe that when we have a destructive government that has come after our freedoms and our rights and that has proven itself to be an authoritarian force that isn't going away, it's not just our right, it's our duty to throw off such a force.
[00:50:22.654 --> 00:50:24.075]  But I don't want to stupidly do it.
[00:50:24.095 --> 00:50:26.176]  I don't want to be led by the ADL, the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[00:50:26.196 --> 00:50:28.058]  I don't want to be led by idiots.
[00:50:29.038 --> 00:50:31.000]  I don't want to go at the wrong targets.
[00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:40.766]  And I want to exhaust every form of unofficial warfare, because war is just politics by other means, as Von Bismarck said.
[00:50:41.847 --> 00:50:42.908]  The pen is mightier than the sword.
[00:50:43.588 --> 00:50:47.471]  And so I'm not very good at war if I can't win with the pen.
[00:50:48.712 --> 00:50:49.833]  And so I'm really trying to do that.
[00:50:50.748 --> 00:50:56.617]  And I'll assure you, I'm not looking for war, but if war ever came, and whatever role I had to have in it, I would prosecute as hard as I do this show.
[00:50:57.197 --> 00:50:57.979]  With my full intent.
[00:50:59.275 --> 00:51:01.676]  But we have the truth and justice on our side.
[00:51:02.196 --> 00:51:08.238]  And if Martin Luther King could do what he did, or Mahatma Gandhi, or Jesus Christ, their example, shouldn't we follow that example as long as we can?
[00:51:08.778 --> 00:51:10.418]  Now, Mike Dunn, I appreciate him coming on.
[00:51:10.558 --> 00:51:12.739]  Usually people we disagree with are cowards and don't come on.
[00:51:13.719 --> 00:51:14.960]  So he gets high marks coming on.
[00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:17.881]  And Mike Dunn is a well-known Boogaloo boy.
[00:51:17.901 --> 00:51:22.362]  They call him the leader, the founder, constitutional adherent, 20-year-old former Trump
[00:51:23.106 --> 00:51:24.327]  Supporter turned libertarian.
[00:51:24.627 --> 00:51:26.068]  I guess he was in the Marines too as well.
[00:51:26.668 --> 00:51:28.670]  And so I'm going to try to give him the floor of the rest of this segment.
[00:51:28.690 --> 00:51:29.750]  We've got about seven minutes left.
[00:51:30.071 --> 00:51:31.552]  Then I've got my questions and my comments.
[00:51:31.592 --> 00:51:33.013]  So he wants to set us straight.
[00:51:33.353 --> 00:51:35.154]  We're all about folks that want to set us straight.
[00:51:35.574 --> 00:51:37.055]  And if I'm wrong, I will apologize.
[00:51:37.095 --> 00:51:37.996]  So Mike, thanks for coming on.
[00:51:39.585 --> 00:51:40.126]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:51:40.786 --> 00:51:42.548]  First things first, I'm not the leader of the Boogaloo.
[00:51:42.728 --> 00:51:43.409]  I'm not the founder.
[00:51:43.649 --> 00:51:44.830]  It's an autonomous movement.
[00:51:45.231 --> 00:51:49.455]  I'm just someone who's in the movement who helped make it big in the media limelight and public face.
[00:51:50.376 --> 00:51:53.719]  And I happen to control a large portion of the movement.
[00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:55.601]  So I just wanted to get that straight.
[00:51:55.641 --> 00:51:57.923]  The movement was not founded by me and I'm not the leader of it.
[00:51:58.583 --> 00:52:01.106]  Simply a prominent figure in it.
[00:52:02.951 --> 00:52:04.775]  To start with, Alex, you started with a quote.
[00:52:05.016 --> 00:52:07.581]  I want to address that as well from yourself.
[00:52:07.642 --> 00:52:08.704]  Here's some other quotes from you.
[00:52:08.724 --> 00:52:09.145]  1776 is the answer to 1984.
[00:52:11.861 --> 00:52:26.095]  You also said if just 5% of people got motivated in some direction, and it doesn't have to be what I believe in, but if they got motivated and stopped getting their political ideologies from the media, they would go and figure out what they want.
[00:52:26.535 --> 00:52:27.696]  And we're literally doing that.
[00:52:27.836 --> 00:52:28.997]  We have been motivated.
[00:52:30.018 --> 00:52:34.382]  We figured out what we wanted, which is freedom from tyranny, and we're willing to stand against that.
[00:52:34.422 --> 00:52:35.423]  When you say 1776 is the answer to 1984,
[00:52:37.325 --> 00:52:38.666]  Hold on a second, I don't mean to interrupt you.
[00:52:38.686 --> 00:52:39.267]  I'm on the road.
[00:52:39.287 --> 00:52:40.528]  I don't see what they're putting up.
[00:52:40.548 --> 00:52:43.150]  Let's not put any articles up right now because I'll get to my questions coming up.
[00:52:43.170 --> 00:52:45.012]  I want him to have the floor uninterrupted.
[00:52:45.452 --> 00:52:46.153]  Please continue.
[00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:06.062]  One of your statements that I personally like, and I've followed you for several years.
[00:53:07.282 --> 00:53:08.523]  I am with Owen Shroyer.
[00:53:08.643 --> 00:53:14.265]  I showed interest in Owen Shroyer back in, I think, the end of 2019 when he was taken off the Capital Four.
[00:53:15.045 --> 00:53:15.785]  But 1776 is the answer to 1984.
[00:53:15.825 --> 00:53:16.946]  I want to paint you a picture from 1776.
[00:53:21.741 --> 00:53:25.743]  January 18th, Major Habersheen arrests a Royal Governor, James Wright.
[00:53:26.143 --> 00:53:28.344]  March 2nd, Americans begin shelling Boston.
[00:53:28.384 --> 00:53:31.866]  March 4th, we capture Dorchester Heights after a bloody battle.
[00:53:31.946 --> 00:53:33.746]  April 7th, we had a bloody major sea battle.
[00:53:34.207 --> 00:53:36.167]  August 27th, we had the Battle of Long Island.
[00:53:36.208 --> 00:53:38.088]  September 15th, we had another bloody battle.
[00:53:38.128 --> 00:53:41.210]  September 21st, New York City, a quarter of it was burned.
[00:53:41.570 --> 00:53:43.231]  October 11th, we had another bloody battle.
[00:53:43.271 --> 00:53:44.611]  That's just one of the many instances of 1776.
[00:53:44.651 --> 00:53:45.051]  So when you call for 1776,
[00:53:49.904 --> 00:53:53.006]  I almost feel like you're doing it just for the merch and not for the actual fact.
[00:53:54.267 --> 00:54:02.632]  We understand that our laws, our avenues that we should go through have been clogged up by old men in politics.
[00:54:03.152 --> 00:54:05.333]  Politicians who are there for the money, they've been clogged up.
[00:54:05.733 --> 00:54:07.935]  They've blocked us from actually having access to our rights.
[00:54:08.115 --> 00:54:13.798]  They've infringed upon constitutional rights, whether it be the First Amendment, the Second Amendment, the Fourth Amendment, it doesn't matter.
[00:54:14.138 --> 00:54:15.079]  They've infringed on those
[00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:18.881]  On those rights, and we've realized that those avenues are no longer open to us.
[00:54:19.021 --> 00:54:22.661]  And so the only answer to that is to try to win the hearts of the minds of the people.
[00:54:23.081 --> 00:54:25.142]  And ultimately, there is going to be a revolution.
[00:54:25.242 --> 00:54:25.962]  Even you know this.
[00:54:26.582 --> 00:54:27.402]  And I know this.
[00:54:28.542 --> 00:54:31.183]  As far as the Boogaloo is concerned, we're centrist, most of us.
[00:54:32.623 --> 00:54:35.264]  We're libertarian.
[00:54:35.604 --> 00:54:38.224]  And we believe in freedom and liberty for all.
[00:54:38.664 --> 00:54:39.724]  We don't identify with the right.
[00:54:39.764 --> 00:54:41.205]  We don't identify with the left.
[00:54:42.525 --> 00:54:43.125]  We support
[00:54:44.127 --> 00:54:49.029]  For everybody, whether we agree with what they're saying or not, if they're on public space and it's a peaceful protest, we support that.
[00:54:49.749 --> 00:54:51.670]  We've defended peaceful protests repeatedly.
[00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:56.751]  When we stand up and do what you've asked for, you know, we're 5% of the people.
[00:54:56.771 --> 00:55:03.213]  When we stand up and we're actually doing something and we're believing in it, as a young man, I served in the Corps, I got injured, I ended up with nerve damage around my heart.
[00:55:03.854 --> 00:55:10.736]  But as a young man who's standing up and then to see you come out and say, hey, these guys are CIA ops, unbeknownst to them,
[00:55:11.811 --> 00:55:17.914]  I feel that it was rather ridiculous because a lot of these boys have put their heart, time, and soul into standing for what they believe in.
[00:55:17.954 --> 00:55:18.754]  We've lost lives.
[00:55:19.174 --> 00:55:20.115]  Duncan Lent was killed.
[00:55:20.395 --> 00:55:24.416]  A buddy, a personal friend of mine, was killed in Montgomery County, Maryland, by police.
[00:55:24.877 --> 00:55:25.717]  He was a Boogaloo boy.
[00:55:25.737 --> 00:55:30.259]  They went and served a no-doc search warrant on him, which is a red flag law, which also was endorsed by President Donald Trump.
[00:55:31.099 --> 00:55:32.860]  They went and served that on him and killed him.
[00:55:33.516 --> 00:55:36.657]  And then those of us who stood up and stand out and say, Hey, we're done.
[00:55:36.697 --> 00:55:37.497]  We don't care anymore.
[00:55:37.537 --> 00:55:38.838]  We are the sons of Liberty.
[00:55:39.318 --> 00:55:41.398]  We are going to engage in civil disobedience.
[00:55:41.818 --> 00:55:49.721]  We're not with this targeting private businesses, but if it's a government facility and it's against the government that continues to oppress, then we're going to do it.
[00:55:49.741 --> 00:55:51.541]  We all saw widespread voter fraud.
[00:55:51.901 --> 00:55:53.942]  We all understand what happened in the election.
[00:55:54.282 --> 00:55:55.182]  We're not Trump fans.
[00:55:55.222 --> 00:55:56.162]  We're not Biden fans.
[00:55:56.182 --> 00:55:56.943]  We understand that.
[00:55:56.983 --> 00:56:01.604]  But a lot of you hold onto the hope of voting your way out of voter fraud, which is an impossibility.
[00:56:02.284 --> 00:56:07.247]  We see it as there has to be a revolution, there has to be a result, and it's going to come to that.
[00:56:07.287 --> 00:56:14.550]  We preach unity, bottom scale unity, against the elitists, the globalists, the people who control our country, the people who control our presidents, which you talked about previously.
[00:56:15.791 --> 00:56:19.093]  We see that as a way to say, hey, we're dominating and we're going to stand against it.
[00:56:19.453 --> 00:56:24.716]  We're part of those 3% that have stood up, or in your case, from your quote, you know, it's just 5% of people.
[00:56:25.096 --> 00:56:25.716]  We're part of that.
[00:56:25.796 --> 00:56:26.737]  We're the ones who have stood up.
[00:56:27.297 --> 00:56:31.539]  And that's pretty much all I have to say concerning, you know, the boogaloo and what we're about.
[00:56:31.559 --> 00:56:38.763]  We're about freedom and liberty for all people, non-discrimination, and the Constitution being applicable to those who disagree with you.
[00:56:40.244 --> 00:56:43.126]  Okay, Mike, very interesting points.
[00:56:43.146 --> 00:56:47.068]  I wanted to give you the floor so I'm not accused of overrunning you or not letting you talk.
[00:56:47.088 --> 00:56:47.668]  I do appreciate that.
[00:56:49.710 --> 00:56:55.374]  You probably noticed it came out that Enrique Tarrio Reuters has the documents that he was actually a federal informant.
[00:56:55.714 --> 00:56:56.975]  Does that come as a surprise to you?
[00:56:57.015 --> 00:57:00.157]  Yes, I uploaded that to my Twitter about 20 minutes ago.
[00:57:03.279 --> 00:57:04.280]  See Mike, that's another question.
[00:57:06.181 --> 00:57:07.522]  Maybe you don't get the big picture.
[00:57:07.542 --> 00:57:10.664]  You seem like a smart guy, but there's a lot of things go into this.
[00:57:11.504 --> 00:57:15.027]  You still have a Twitter, but people like me don't.
[00:57:16.264 --> 00:57:17.345]  Yeah, let's talk about that.
[00:57:17.646 --> 00:57:18.707]  Hardware banned on Facebook.
[00:57:18.727 --> 00:57:20.769]  Search terms associated with me are banned on Facebook.
[00:57:21.230 --> 00:57:22.431]  Instagram has hardware banned me.
[00:57:22.451 --> 00:57:24.713]  Search terms associated with me are limited on Instagram.
[00:57:25.374 --> 00:57:30.239]  Almost every other news media outlet, almost every other social media outlet has banned me.
[00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:31.741]  Twitter has repeatedly banned me.
[00:57:31.781 --> 00:57:32.302]  I'm just happy.
[00:57:32.622 --> 00:57:34.143]  I'm not calling for your banning.
[00:57:34.163 --> 00:57:39.445]  I think everybody should have a voice whether it's the Ayatollah Khomeini or you or me or Trump or anybody.
[00:57:39.485 --> 00:57:40.505]  We're gonna go to break.
[00:57:52.290 --> 00:57:52.650]  I don't know.
[00:58:15.363 --> 00:58:23.125]  Yeah, the way things are being done, the strategic plan we had that day to get an investigation of voter fraud, the perfect thing for The Globalist.
[00:58:23.425 --> 00:58:27.206]  Monday, Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:58:27.226 --> 00:58:27.867]  to 3 p.m.
[00:58:27.927 --> 00:58:29.347]  it's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:58:29.867 --> 00:58:42.231]  I'm your host Alex Jones in Utah on a family vacation doing some skiing, doing some hiking, hanging out with the crews that came with me and we've got Owen Schroeder back in the ATX in Austin, Texas.
[00:58:42.611 --> 00:58:43.111]  Mike Dunn,
[00:58:44.051 --> 00:58:55.602]  He is one of the prominent Boogaloo boys, and I guess we get into the history of it and how long it's been around and where it's going, and it's a different political ideologies and the rest of it.
[00:58:56.263 --> 00:59:04.410]  But you were getting, Mike, into 1776 and saying, pretty much, Jones, you kind of ordered us, is what I heard, to go do this.
[00:59:04.430 --> 00:59:07.353]  Well, I thought I was there to have a big demonstration.
[00:59:08.254 --> 00:59:12.216]  And then march with the President and then encamp around the Capitol peacefully.
[00:59:12.236 --> 00:59:15.417]  And we kind of had a blind spot because Trump rallies are always so peaceful.
[00:59:16.037 --> 00:59:20.399]  We know very small groups, Antifa and some other folks, helped break through, helped get in.
[00:59:20.419 --> 00:59:22.779]  Then a few hundred people went in.
[00:59:22.839 --> 00:59:24.640]  They stayed within the velvet ropes.
[00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:28.161]  So I don't think this was anywhere near Pearl Harbor, as Chuckie Schumer said.
[00:59:28.201 --> 00:59:31.683]  It's about one one-millionth of Pearl Harbor.
[00:59:32.583 --> 00:59:36.965]  And so I'm just trying to figure out, are these, because you mentioned this,
[00:59:38.215 --> 00:59:45.540]  And you can respond to the 1776 thing, because I'm somebody that's very clear that I believe in civil disobedience.
[00:59:45.620 --> 00:59:50.063]  I believe in defensive defense and violence.
[00:59:50.843 --> 00:59:51.824]  I really want to fix this peacefully.
[00:59:51.844 --> 00:59:53.825]  In fact, let's just go there first.
[00:59:54.226 --> 01:00:00.630]  You're saying, listening to my work, my energy, you're taking from that the idea of revolution or armed conflict?
[01:00:01.852 --> 01:00:03.573]  I definitely wouldn't say that I took it directly from you.
[01:00:03.613 --> 01:00:16.442]  I'm just saying that the idea that you portray and the message that you carry sometimes tend to look like you're just there to create merch and not actually, you know, stand for an actual revolution.
[01:00:16.582 --> 01:00:24.208]  You talk about, you know, peaceful protesting and I always thought, you know, the Alex Jones I listened to growing up was someone who wanted the government to fear the people.
[01:00:24.648 --> 01:00:44.080]  You know, and so I'm not saying that you incited it or you directed it, but I am saying that if you continue to preach a 1776 revolution or the type of message that you preach, you're going to have to figure out whether you're just going to bend the knee and continue to make your talk show or if you're actually going to stand against the tyranny that is present in the U.S.
[01:00:45.131 --> 01:00:46.872]  Well, Mike, let's be 100% clear.
[01:00:48.093 --> 01:00:50.655]  You better believe I sell t-shirts and I sell product.
[01:00:50.695 --> 01:00:51.595]  That gets the word out.
[01:00:51.615 --> 01:00:52.516]  That's identification.
[01:00:52.876 --> 01:00:53.597]  Oh, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[01:00:53.817 --> 01:00:54.718]  They want to shut us down.
[01:00:55.218 --> 01:00:56.179]  They want to kill our speech.
[01:00:56.199 --> 01:00:57.800]  They don't want us to exercise our speech online.
[01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:03.163]  You guys wear your shirts that are Hawaiian shirts, as you can be known.
[01:01:03.504 --> 01:01:04.384]  We're Infowars.
[01:01:04.704 --> 01:01:07.366]  And damn right, I've got the globalists trying to shut me down.
[01:01:07.386 --> 01:01:08.527]  I am a capitalist.
[01:01:08.607 --> 01:01:09.388]  I'm not ashamed.
[01:01:09.468 --> 01:01:14.331]  I didn't get $10.6 billion from Democrat donors and George Soros like Black Lives Matter.
[01:01:14.631 --> 01:01:19.372]  So I don't get any funding like Antifa or BLM.
[01:01:19.412 --> 01:01:20.893]  I don't have people volunteering to do my security.
[01:01:20.933 --> 01:01:21.653]  I pay my security.
[01:01:22.173 --> 01:01:24.234]  I don't have the Boogaloo Boys volunteering for my security.
[01:01:24.514 --> 01:01:25.354]  I pay for my security.
[01:01:25.774 --> 01:01:27.314]  So, I mean, I'm a capitalist.
[01:01:27.414 --> 01:01:28.915]  I am not ashamed of selling products.
[01:01:29.335 --> 01:01:35.777]  But to be clear, if we get to a point where I think I've got to be violent, then I'll do what I have to do.
[01:01:35.817 --> 01:01:37.077]  That's why I'm fighting so hard.
[01:01:37.657 --> 01:01:38.417]  That's why I'm fighting so hard.
[01:01:38.437 --> 01:01:40.798]  Because I'm not going to stand around capitals with guns if I get violent.
[01:01:41.243 --> 01:01:41.503]  Okay.
[01:01:41.903 --> 01:01:44.385]  In fact, tell me how this revolution... Tell you what, you've got the floor again.
[01:01:44.665 --> 01:01:45.785]  How does this revolution look?
[01:01:46.165 --> 01:01:47.686]  How do you see this thing unfolding?
[01:01:47.806 --> 01:01:51.448]  Tell me, General George Washington 2.0, how we're going to do this revolution.
[01:01:53.049 --> 01:01:53.329]  I don't know.
[01:01:53.349 --> 01:01:56.430]  I thought you were the General George Washington 2.0.
[01:01:56.731 --> 01:01:57.211]  No, no, no.
[01:01:57.251 --> 01:01:59.192]  I'm not the guy out there saying we're going to have a revolution.
[01:01:59.572 --> 01:02:02.794]  So tell me... We need a Declaration of Independence by the states.
[01:02:03.054 --> 01:02:07.296]  We need a coalition of leaders ready with a bill of particulars of what we want, and then we go to war.
[01:02:08.463 --> 01:02:10.306]  Not a bunch of people taking selfies in the Capitol.
[01:02:10.326 --> 01:02:11.288]  That's the opposite of what we need.
[01:02:11.528 --> 01:02:12.430]  We need George Washington.
[01:02:12.450 --> 01:02:13.251]  He hasn't shown up yet.
[01:02:13.552 --> 01:02:15.395]  So, I'm telling you.
[01:02:15.735 --> 01:02:17.798]  Tell me what we do, General Dunn.
[01:02:17.838 --> 01:02:18.480]  What do we do right now?
[01:02:20.389 --> 01:02:21.550]  Go for it.
[01:02:21.670 --> 01:02:23.191]  Get those papers in order.
[01:02:23.231 --> 01:02:25.172]  Get the plan of government for AFTER in order.
[01:02:25.453 --> 01:02:28.134]  And actually get it done and start building forces like you're supposed to.
[01:02:28.174 --> 01:02:29.135]  Like all of us have done.
[01:02:29.455 --> 01:02:30.216]  We've been together.
[01:02:30.276 --> 01:02:31.257]  We've stood together.
[01:02:31.697 --> 01:02:36.180]  We go to our capitals armed where they say, you know, in Richmond, Virginia, Owen Sawyer drove there.
[01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:37.421]  He saw some of my guys there armed.
[01:02:37.641 --> 01:02:39.382]  They said, hey, you can't open carry here anymore.
[01:02:39.402 --> 01:02:40.223]  It's illegal now.
[01:02:40.543 --> 01:02:40.823]  We went.
[01:02:40.843 --> 01:02:41.543]  We disobeyed it.
[01:02:41.844 --> 01:02:45.886]  If they had tried to arrest us, we would have used the Second Amendment the way that it was intended, which is to limit... Hold on.
[01:02:45.906 --> 01:02:46.387]  Say that again.
[01:02:46.427 --> 01:02:47.147]  Where did you do this?
[01:02:47.267 --> 01:02:49.068]  Because this is you putting your money where your mouth is.
[01:02:49.088 --> 01:02:49.589]  Where did you do this?
[01:02:50.492 --> 01:02:51.573]  This is in Richmond, Virginia.
[01:02:51.633 --> 01:02:53.815]  It's illegal to open carry any protest or event arm.
[01:02:54.775 --> 01:02:58.318]  So we go there for Owen Sawyer's thing when he came through with the Stop the Steal.
[01:02:58.639 --> 01:03:04.724]  We've been at every protest, whether it be MAGA, Black Lives Matter, anything, to make sure that things are peaceful and respectful.
[01:03:05.304 --> 01:03:06.185]  And we go there armed.
[01:03:06.205 --> 01:03:07.145]  We disobey the law.
[01:03:07.426 --> 01:03:08.607]  We stand against the tyranny.
[01:03:09.147 --> 01:03:16.273]  And what we see, people like you, Alex, who used to be my hero as a young man, we see y'all bending the knee to it repeatedly.
[01:03:17.174 --> 01:03:28.267]  You have your talk shows, you give your speeches, but y'all don't actually stand against tyranny, and that's disheartening as a young man, a young American, and someone involved in the liberty movement and constitutionalism, personally, I'm not speaking for this country.
[01:03:28.307 --> 01:03:33.854]  How am I not standing against tyranny, fighting evil legislation, marching, going out and having events?
[01:03:34.214 --> 01:03:34.435]  Sorry?
[01:03:35.782 --> 01:03:36.923]  Because you talk.
[01:03:37.343 --> 01:03:38.684]  We go out there, we actually disobey.
[01:03:39.325 --> 01:03:40.185]  We stand there armed.
[01:03:40.305 --> 01:03:44.008]  We don't bootlick like a lot of you and Republicans do.
[01:03:44.448 --> 01:03:46.790]  We actually stand up against the tyranny that is prevalent.
[01:03:47.290 --> 01:03:48.411]  That's what I want to see y'all do.
[01:03:48.431 --> 01:03:50.332]  When you ask, well, what's the revolution look like?
[01:03:50.733 --> 01:03:51.393]  Well, there you go.
[01:03:51.453 --> 01:03:53.334]  It's us engaging in civil disobedience.
[01:03:53.354 --> 01:03:54.135]  And if they decide
[01:03:54.515 --> 01:03:59.217]  Well, no, I have supported open carry and I've supported the lawsuits and all the rest of it, so that's not a fair statement.
[01:03:59.237 --> 01:04:01.498]  What I'm getting at here is the strategic blunder of rushing into the Capitol
[01:04:19.349 --> 01:04:25.510]  The strategic blunder of the selfies and the Q-Tard stuff and all the rest of it is not what Trump wanted.
[01:04:25.550 --> 01:04:26.331]  It's not what I wanted.
[01:04:26.371 --> 01:04:30.471]  That was our rally to try to put pressure on them to have a 10-day investigation of election fraud.
[01:04:30.791 --> 01:04:34.752]  So wait, do you think what happened at the Capitol was a victory or a fiasco?
[01:04:36.393 --> 01:04:39.153]  I definitely think it was the right thing for the wrong reasons.
[01:04:39.333 --> 01:04:41.254]  I think it was a good way to make government fear the people again.
[01:04:41.614 --> 01:04:44.654]  It was nice to see members of Congress on their knees fearing the people.
[01:04:45.635 --> 01:04:47.115]  I think it was the right thing for the wrong reasons.
[01:04:49.813 --> 01:04:53.195]  So you now wish that people wouldn't have knocked down the doors and gone in there?
[01:04:54.876 --> 01:04:58.759]  I wish 100% that people would do it more all over this country and make government fear the people.
[01:05:00.811 --> 01:05:04.834]  You know, if I may chime in here, because I've been brought up a couple times.
[01:05:05.094 --> 01:05:08.917]  Here's what I think the problem is, and this is what I said after January 6th.
[01:05:09.237 --> 01:05:15.942]  We can discuss the events of January 6th, what happened, or what 1776 to defeat 1984 means.
[01:05:15.982 --> 01:05:19.505]  The problem is, we're not actually having that intellectual debate.
[01:05:20.226 --> 01:05:22.827]  There's no doubt that we have encroaching global government.
[01:05:22.868 --> 01:05:25.169]  There's no doubt that the government's out of control.
[01:05:25.209 --> 01:05:29.432]  There's no doubt that the biggest crooks in America are in Washington, D.C.
[01:05:30.453 --> 01:05:31.573]  90% of Americans would agree to that.
[01:05:32.333 --> 01:05:35.834]  Here's the problem though, and Mike, I'd like to get your response to this.
[01:05:36.554 --> 01:05:50.697]  We're not in a 1776 colonist versus the British government time where we're hiding in the woods and we've got the local communities and they don't have a world technocracy set up against us or a federal government set up against us.
[01:05:50.717 --> 01:05:53.797]  I mean, I've been to jail multiple times for my free speech.
[01:05:53.857 --> 01:05:54.357]  You know that.
[01:05:54.877 --> 01:05:58.898]  So, I mean, to sit here and say... No, you've done nothing because you didn't stand around in a Hawaiian shirt with a gun.
[01:05:59.198 --> 01:06:09.601]  But my point is, if you really think you're going to launch some sort of a physical kinetic war against the deep state or against D.C., there's just no path to victory there.
[01:06:09.621 --> 01:06:11.442]  I mean, the whole federal government is against you.
[01:06:11.482 --> 01:06:12.482]  Well, there actually is.
[01:06:12.502 --> 01:06:13.142]  Let's go to break.
[01:06:13.162 --> 01:06:15.803]  I'm not calling for this, but the Capitol is a puppet.
[01:06:16.972 --> 01:06:18.093]  I don't
[01:06:37.096 --> 01:06:37.796]  The West is the best!
[01:07:09.844 --> 01:07:13.346]  The West is the best, and it's gonna do the rest.
[01:07:14.567 --> 01:07:15.707]  Guess we'll have to ban this song.
[01:07:15.727 --> 01:07:18.669]  I know everybody's trying to get into the West.
[01:07:19.049 --> 01:07:19.949]  What is it about the West?
[01:07:20.590 --> 01:07:21.190]  What is it?
[01:07:25.472 --> 01:07:37.159]  Since 2019, at least 31 people affiliated with the Boogaloo movement have been charged with crimes including the killing of two security and law enforcement officers, a plot to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer,
[01:07:38.611 --> 01:07:41.112]  Let me ask Mr. Dunn, the founder of the Boogaloos,
[01:08:03.663 --> 01:08:05.024]  Let me ask him this question.
[01:08:05.524 --> 01:08:12.988]  Are those people that don't speak for Boogaloos, because you're one of the most prominent members of them, you're not the leader, but you're the guy that always gets brought up.
[01:08:13.948 --> 01:08:16.470]  I mean, who are these people getting arrested?
[01:08:16.790 --> 01:08:20.672]  Are they launching the good revolution, or are those not good Boogaloos?
[01:08:22.807 --> 01:08:23.488]  It's like anything.
[01:08:24.008 --> 01:08:27.250]  Some are legitimate Boogaloo boys who we know, who were in our circles.
[01:08:27.830 --> 01:08:34.735]  And then, once again, anybody can claim, hey, I'm Boogaloo, just like anybody can claim they're associated with you or claim that you incited the insurrection.
[01:08:35.615 --> 01:08:41.019]  I wanted to answer Owen's question or Owen's statement from a minute ago, if I could have permission to do that.
[01:08:41.619 --> 01:08:42.180]  Sure, go ahead.
[01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:45.022]  And Owen, jump in anytime you want.
[01:08:45.622 --> 01:08:55.450]  You know, my response to it, and what I think he was leading into and what he had mentioned, you know, legislative bodies going through the courts, the lawful way of protests and so on.
[01:08:55.570 --> 01:09:01.714]  If y'all haven't noticed for about the past 160 years since the last war, we've done that.
[01:09:02.375 --> 01:09:03.816]  Those avenues have been used.
[01:09:04.478 --> 01:09:13.364]  And if you think you can vote your way out of voter fraud, or push your rights through the courts that have already tread on those same rights... Hold on, let me just stop you, because let me finish my statement.
[01:09:13.384 --> 01:09:15.085]  Let me just finish my statement to give more clarity.
[01:09:15.726 --> 01:09:23.431]  I'm just saying, if you really think that a violent revolution is the answer, you've got to understand you're going up against a completely different enemy than what we had in 1776.
[01:09:24.372 --> 01:09:27.754]  Way more powerful, way more seditious, way more in the shadows.
[01:09:28.094 --> 01:09:31.497]  The feds come to arrest you in the middle of the night, nobody's going to have your back.
[01:09:31.897 --> 01:09:32.637]  Who's going to have your back?
[01:09:32.677 --> 01:09:33.618]  They'll just disappear you.
[01:09:34.118 --> 01:09:37.299]  And I think the thing we have to do first... Mike, let me finish please, sir.
[01:09:37.779 --> 01:09:42.301]  The thing we have to do first is we have to have common unity.
[01:09:42.361 --> 01:09:46.842]  This can't be Boogaloo vs. Infowars or Mike vs. Alex or Owen vs. this or Black Lives Matter here.
[01:09:47.543 --> 01:09:47.903]  Everyone!
[01:09:48.003 --> 01:09:50.764]  I can disagree with Black Lives Matter, Antifa, Boogaloo, whatever, all day long.
[01:09:51.044 --> 01:09:52.406]  We're all anti-establishment.
[01:09:52.686 --> 01:09:54.488]  We have to come together and have that unity.
[01:09:54.808 --> 01:10:00.574]  That will have our politicians in more fear is us having unity than saying, we're coming with guns.
[01:10:00.794 --> 01:10:03.517]  They'll wipe us off the map if we do that.
[01:10:03.537 --> 01:10:05.159]  Do you know the military will have our back?
[01:10:05.379 --> 01:10:06.100]  We don't know that.
[01:10:06.581 --> 01:10:07.762]  Unity has to be the first step.
[01:10:07.782 --> 01:10:08.222]  Let's go further.
[01:10:08.302 --> 01:10:09.163]  Swallows well.
[01:10:09.904 --> 01:10:15.926]  Says that he'll nuke American gun owners, which is totally unfeasible and ridiculous and insane, and he doesn't even know what he's talking about.
[01:10:16.686 --> 01:10:18.386]  Just look, look, look, look, here's the deal.
[01:10:18.727 --> 01:10:20.887]  Mike, I get you on here, you seem like a real guy.
[01:10:21.327 --> 01:10:34.931]  You don't seem like a Southern Poverty Law Center operative, you don't seem like an ADL operative, but certainly, Mike, you know about the Southern Poverty Law Center's history of infiltrating militias, populist right-wing groups, and then provocateuring them.
[01:10:34.951 --> 01:10:37.052]  I mean, do you know about the long history of false flags?
[01:10:38.396 --> 01:10:39.476]  Yeah, I do.
[01:10:39.536 --> 01:10:44.737]  And I just wanted to respond to Owen real quick and say that's exactly what we have been doing.
[01:10:45.078 --> 01:10:48.938]  Michigan, Ohio, look up Magnus on Twitter, his speech.
[01:10:49.138 --> 01:10:52.959]  We've been uniting people under Black Lives Matter, traditional militias.
[01:10:52.979 --> 01:10:54.940]  We've been uniting them for one common cause.
[01:10:55.340 --> 01:10:57.600]  But yet, you know, we put in that work.
[01:10:57.700 --> 01:10:58.501]  We've done that.
[01:10:58.561 --> 01:11:04.022]  You can go back to one of my first public events, which was July 4th of last year, where we united Black Lives Matter gun owners.
[01:11:04.542 --> 01:11:08.487]  Well, that means you got with Black Lives Matter low levels that weren't Soros Democratic Party.
[01:11:23.466 --> 01:11:27.089]  I've seen the videos, because a lot of well-meaning black folks come out thinking they're doing something.
[01:11:27.309 --> 01:11:30.951]  I mean, come on, man, George Soros and the UN and the Globalists run Black Lives Matter.
[01:11:31.792 --> 01:11:33.173]  $10.6 billion in funding.
[01:11:33.213 --> 01:11:33.813]  You know that, right?
[01:11:34.073 --> 01:11:36.415]  But notice how Black Lives Matter goes after private businesses.
[01:11:36.435 --> 01:11:37.015]  Hold on, let him talk.
[01:11:37.176 --> 01:11:38.356]  We'll go to the next hour if need to.
[01:11:38.376 --> 01:11:40.958]  You'll get your time on, but just explain that to me, Don.
[01:11:41.058 --> 01:11:43.360]  I agree, Alex.
[01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:47.743]  The organization is funded by people who have misused them, but a lot of the movement
[01:11:50.529 --> 01:11:55.131]  They're actual individuals who believe what they stand for, and we stand by the fact that Black Lives Matter.
[01:11:55.451 --> 01:12:01.754]  I've seen them actually racially discriminated against in my own cities, so I'm willing to stand with them and defend their right to speak.
[01:12:01.774 --> 01:12:03.335]  You see that picture right there you just put up?
[01:12:03.735 --> 01:12:06.837]  The police did not touch that peaceful protest while we were on the frontline arm.
[01:12:07.177 --> 01:12:08.037]  They did not touch them.
[01:12:08.357 --> 01:12:13.520]  Antifa started chanting, F Mike Dunn, F Boogaloos, F Black Lives Matter 757, which is an organization
[01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:19.805]  An organization that has reached out to us and actually formed in a cohesive body and we've stood together side-by-side.
[01:12:20.026 --> 01:12:22.968]  They started chatting that we left because we said, hey, we don't want to split the crowd.
[01:12:23.008 --> 01:12:23.609]  Y'all do your thing.
[01:12:24.049 --> 01:12:28.213]  The minute we left... So you recognize that Antifa is a globalist organization?
[01:12:29.254 --> 01:12:32.897]  I recognize that a lot of Antifa factions are the same as Black Lives Matter.
[01:12:33.117 --> 01:12:33.958]  Here's an example.
[01:12:34.718 --> 01:12:39.342]  Here's photos that we were sent in Austin by one of our friends of...
[01:12:41.414 --> 01:12:42.115]  You think so?
[01:12:59.990 --> 01:13:00.991]  Well, let me just bring this up.
[01:13:01.552 --> 01:13:03.113]  And some of them were saying they were Boogaloos.
[01:13:03.353 --> 01:13:04.414]  I mean, look at this guy.
[01:13:04.434 --> 01:13:04.674]  Come on.
[01:13:04.934 --> 01:13:06.816]  What's up with the zip ties?
[01:13:06.896 --> 01:13:09.478]  So all I'm saying is, they're saying armed revolution's coming.
[01:13:09.918 --> 01:13:11.740]  These are the people claiming they're with your movement.
[01:13:13.264 --> 01:13:18.708]  General Patton was in Tifa, and while you're throwing up those pictures, you probably want to throw up the rest of all the armed protests that we put on and done.
[01:13:18.748 --> 01:13:21.750]  So you can obviously pull a select picture and say, hey, these are the people.
[01:13:22.030 --> 01:13:27.014]  But until you actually pull out the pictures... General Patton actually wanted to join with the Germans and attack the Russians.
[01:13:27.074 --> 01:13:31.477]  So to say that he was Antifa is, he was probably actually one of the only fascist generals we had.
[01:13:31.537 --> 01:13:35.880]  I'm not even against Patton, but you're now saying General George T. Patton was an Antifa?
[01:13:37.830 --> 01:13:41.854]  That led the force to fight and combat fascism is what I'm talking about.
[01:13:41.874 --> 01:13:45.197]  No, he was racing to take over Berlin so he could get the Nazis behind him to beat the Russians.
[01:13:45.217 --> 01:13:46.539]  Antifa.
[01:13:46.999 --> 01:13:48.140]  Our country is Antifa.
[01:13:48.180 --> 01:13:49.362]  That's why they killed him, buddy.
[01:13:49.782 --> 01:13:51.524]  I interviewed the son of the guy that killed him.
[01:13:53.285 --> 01:13:54.507]  But we are Antifa.
[01:13:54.847 --> 01:13:55.528]  You can't argue that.
[01:13:55.568 --> 01:13:57.570]  Are you anti-fascist or do you support fascism?
[01:13:59.552 --> 01:14:01.814]  You're taking these arguments at face value, Mike.
[01:14:02.174 --> 01:14:05.176]  If you try to ask an Antifa member, they don't really understand what's going on.
[01:14:05.216 --> 01:14:06.597]  Again, notice where they go.
[01:14:06.717 --> 01:14:07.717]  They don't go to Google.
[01:14:07.777 --> 01:14:09.038]  They don't go to government buildings.
[01:14:09.058 --> 01:14:09.919]  They don't go to capitals.
[01:14:10.179 --> 01:14:11.740]  They go to Home Depot.
[01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:13.841]  They go to, you know, 7-Eleven.
[01:14:13.881 --> 01:14:15.102]  They burn down a Kwik Trip.
[01:14:15.142 --> 01:14:16.263]  I mean, it's total chaos.
[01:14:16.283 --> 01:14:17.003]  You can't have that.
[01:14:17.043 --> 01:14:18.684]  They burn down somebody's private car dealership.
[01:14:18.704 --> 01:14:19.545]  So let's expand on this.
[01:14:19.905 --> 01:14:22.086]  You raised this, Don, and I'm not here trying to attack you.
[01:14:22.106 --> 01:14:23.467]  I mean, you come off as a real person.
[01:14:23.507 --> 01:14:24.068]  I'll just say that.
[01:14:24.688 --> 01:14:27.191]  Exclusive, Boogaloo Boy, you raised this so we looked it up.
[01:14:27.551 --> 01:14:31.455]  Boogaloo Boy Leader, who aligns with Black Lives Matter, because we didn't put this up.
[01:14:31.475 --> 01:14:32.657]  You're like, you can put that up on screen.
[01:14:32.677 --> 01:14:35.380]  I'm like, I didn't know, we didn't put this on screen.
[01:14:35.420 --> 01:14:36.461]  You raised it, we got it up.
[01:14:36.941 --> 01:14:43.568]  Exclusive, Boogaloo Boy Leader, who aligns with Black Lives Matter, Gateway Pundit, boasted about organizing armed insurrection on U.S.
[01:14:43.588 --> 01:14:44.069]  Capitol.
[01:14:44.550 --> 01:14:46.251]  Are these your archived tweets or not about
[01:14:47.152 --> 01:14:50.373]  Uh, BB teams have been activated in Virginia.
[01:14:50.413 --> 01:14:55.715]  We are currently four fire teams, those assault squads, inside the Capitol.
[01:14:55.795 --> 01:14:57.375]  Simper, you know, death to tyrants.
[01:14:57.795 --> 01:15:00.136]  And it's all right here about we rub it in your face.
[01:15:00.176 --> 01:15:01.056]  You have no security.
[01:15:01.416 --> 01:15:02.137]  We're in charge.
[01:15:02.197 --> 01:15:03.397]  Did you or did you not tweet that?
[01:15:04.989 --> 01:15:05.950]  One thousand percent.
[01:15:06.010 --> 01:15:08.931]  And note that the Capitol is not the same as the Capitol, which means the building.
[01:15:08.971 --> 01:15:10.092]  It means the city of D.C.
[01:15:10.833 --> 01:15:11.273]  So note that.
[01:15:11.313 --> 01:15:18.998]  And furthermore, note that that media can twist anything that's said out of perspective and take away from tweets it was originally connected with.
[01:15:19.998 --> 01:15:20.498]  They can do that.
[01:15:20.518 --> 01:15:21.219]  They do it easily.
[01:15:21.279 --> 01:15:24.401]  So don't fall into the same thing that you preach against, which is listening to media.
[01:15:25.441 --> 01:15:27.621]  Yeah, but don't you understand that's the problem?
[01:15:27.661 --> 01:15:28.302]  I trust them.
[01:15:28.822 --> 01:15:29.822]  I found them to be very accurate.
[01:15:29.842 --> 01:15:30.602]  But okay, fine.
[01:15:30.922 --> 01:15:32.102]  I won't just out of hand trust them.
[01:15:32.222 --> 01:15:33.462]  We're going to go to break in a moment.
[01:15:34.003 --> 01:15:35.943]  I'm going to give you the floor to respond to this when we come back.
[01:15:36.003 --> 01:15:38.543]  But I was honest with everybody around my office.
[01:15:39.704 --> 01:15:43.064]  And I'm not an informant like Enrique Tarrio.
[01:15:43.704 --> 01:15:47.365]  But at the same time, I want to expose the federal forces that are involved in this.
[01:15:48.105 --> 01:15:53.426]  We identified Boogaloos and we identified Proud Boys leading the attack on the Capitol with Antifa.
[01:15:54.019 --> 01:15:55.420]  And I'm now bringing all this out today.
[01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:57.602]  I was already intending to before this broke about Tarrio.
[01:15:58.182 --> 01:16:00.144]  So, and we have the footage.
[01:16:01.745 --> 01:16:03.086]  So no Boogaloo is in the Capitol.
[01:16:04.627 --> 01:16:07.009]  Put it up of a Boogaloo boy walking into the Capitol.
[01:16:07.429 --> 01:16:09.311]  And I will... Oh, and then have their faces covered.
[01:16:09.351 --> 01:16:12.073]  But, I mean, well, we got you saying you have fire teams inside the Capitol.
[01:16:12.113 --> 01:16:13.754]  But I'm going to ask you right now.
[01:16:15.515 --> 01:16:16.716]  You said we're inside the Capitol.
[01:16:16.857 --> 01:16:17.917]  You said that doesn't mean what you said.
[01:16:19.078 --> 01:16:19.378]  D.C.
[01:16:19.418 --> 01:16:21.060]  is the Capitol, not the Capitol Building.
[01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:21.980]  Oh, D.C.
[01:16:22.261 --> 01:16:23.001]  is the Capitol.
[01:16:23.281 --> 01:16:23.582]  Okay.
[01:16:24.344 --> 01:16:25.864]  Okay, well, here's the deal.
[01:16:25.884 --> 01:16:32.006]  We're going to find out who these guys wearing camo that had masks on, and we think they work for the FBI, okay?
[01:16:32.746 --> 01:16:37.707]  Because our president that really got elected is on trial in a week and a half, and we're pissed off about it, okay?
[01:16:38.087 --> 01:16:42.949]  And we wanted to put peaceful pressure on them to show our numbers, and we got screwed over by some people.
[01:16:42.969 --> 01:16:43.769]  We're going to find out who they are.
[01:16:44.469 --> 01:16:45.190]  And we are back.
[01:16:45.250 --> 01:16:55.943]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and I'm about to do something with my hundred-plus crew and all the Democrat lawsuits and our satellites and our own infrastructure, our own servers, parlors shut down, Telegram shut, you know, they're shutting everything down.
[01:16:55.963 --> 01:16:57.525]  We're only on air because of you.
[01:16:58.926 --> 01:17:00.488]  And we've had big sales for months.
[01:17:00.548 --> 01:17:01.870]  We've sold out of so many products.
[01:17:02.450 --> 01:17:04.433]  We have liquid turmeric extract.
[01:17:05.814 --> 01:17:06.434]  Discounted.
[01:17:06.514 --> 01:17:08.235]  We're down to a thousand bottles.
[01:17:08.315 --> 01:17:09.516]  It has 100% reviews.
[01:17:10.016 --> 01:17:11.617]  It's an amazing high-quality product.
[01:17:11.677 --> 01:17:13.358]  It's different than bodies.
[01:17:13.438 --> 01:17:14.818]  That is an ultimate turmeric formula.
[01:17:15.158 --> 01:17:16.359]  This is a humanoid extract.
[01:17:16.419 --> 01:17:18.220]  This is a natural concentrate extract.
[01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:19.921]  They go together like a horse and carriage.
[01:17:21.189 --> 01:17:24.891]  It is discounted right now, but it is selling out today.
[01:17:25.971 --> 01:17:29.353]  Also, X2 is a Deep Earth Crystal Pure Iodine.
[01:17:29.373 --> 01:17:33.275]  We have to get a DEA license at our manufacturer in Arizona.
[01:17:33.615 --> 01:17:36.056]  It's literally locked up, because you know, it's a precursor.
[01:17:36.076 --> 01:17:40.498]  Everybody's seen Breaking Bad, but it's so good for your body.
[01:17:40.558 --> 01:17:41.678]  It's a precursor to everything.
[01:17:41.999 --> 01:17:42.999]  We have the Deep Earth Crystal.
[01:17:43.059 --> 01:17:48.542]  It is 50% off, but that sale has to end in a couple of days, because we're down to like 2,000 bottles
[01:17:50.572 --> 01:17:54.253]  We're not getting more for six weeks because of supply chain breakdown.

[01:18:20.987 --> 01:18:21.708]  It's a great shirt.
[01:18:21.808 --> 01:18:22.769]  I thought it'd be a bestseller.
[01:18:22.889 --> 01:18:23.730]  It is a bestseller.
[01:18:24.491 --> 01:18:26.332]  And the problem is we only printed a couple thousand.
[01:18:26.352 --> 01:18:27.333]  They sold out instantly.
[01:18:27.353 --> 01:18:29.235]  Well, we got more coming in next week.

[01:18:35.782 --> 01:18:37.163]  Everybody else is being shut down.
[01:18:37.283 --> 01:18:38.665]  All the ecosystems are being shut down.

[01:18:57.856 --> 01:18:59.857]  InfoWarStore.com.
[01:18:59.877 --> 01:19:01.238]  The January 2021 Mega Sale ends
[01:19:03.599 --> 01:19:03.980]  I don't know.
[01:19:23.322 --> 01:19:25.063]  It's all at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:19:25.083 --> 01:19:26.384]  I want to thank you all for keeping us on the air.
[01:19:26.644 --> 01:19:27.925]  This is a war, and we salute you.
[01:19:28.225 --> 01:19:32.268]  All right, back to Mike Dunn, and we got Roman Shroyer riding shotgun in the studio.
[01:19:33.188 --> 01:19:36.411]  And Pete Santilli wants to pop in, saying he's been set up like this before.
[01:19:36.911 --> 01:19:39.293]  Looks like COINTELPRO, what they're doing to Enrique Tarrio.
[01:19:39.373 --> 01:19:39.773]  I like it.
[01:19:39.793 --> 01:19:40.533]  He's a nice guy.
[01:19:40.553 --> 01:19:42.074]  They're saying he's a federal informant.
[01:19:42.094 --> 01:19:43.015]  We'll talk about all that.
[01:19:43.535 --> 01:19:46.137]  But for new listeners tuning in, we've gone under world government.
[01:19:46.157 --> 01:19:46.838]  We're fighting back.
[01:19:47.338 --> 01:19:49.041]  We're trying to find out who the provocateur groups are.
[01:19:49.362 --> 01:19:52.508]  And I'll just say it, and I've said this, I'm not against the Proud Boys.
[01:19:52.889 --> 01:19:55.233]  They've been lying about it, I don't think they're racist, all that other stuff.
[01:19:56.089 --> 01:20:01.252]  We know there were proud boys not wearing their outfits, not wearing their uniforms, that were part of the Capitol breach.
[01:20:01.833 --> 01:20:07.536]  We have tweets by you and by other people saying they supported the Capitol attack and that it was a great thing.
[01:20:07.576 --> 01:20:09.217]  Now you're kind of halfway back and off of that.
[01:20:09.758 --> 01:20:11.159]  I'm not here trying to get you arrested.
[01:20:11.619 --> 01:20:17.022]  My big question is, I see this Dr. Gold lady just going in being arrested.
[01:20:17.122 --> 01:20:17.443]  I see
[01:20:19.844 --> 01:20:24.209]  Brandon Strzok being arrested when he was just there doing nothing.
[01:20:24.730 --> 01:20:25.911]  And then it freaks me out.
[01:20:26.171 --> 01:20:31.377]  Who are the men in uniforms with masks handing out clubs saying attack, attack, attack?
[01:20:31.938 --> 01:20:34.921]  That's my big question because I've seen the 1990s, 2000s militia movement.
[01:20:37.332 --> 01:20:41.994]  Where I would be in a shooting range and have feds come over and say, hey, let's blow up a federal building.
[01:20:42.254 --> 01:20:46.116]  And I'd go out and videotape their car, and it was an unmarked federal police, you know, federal car.
[01:20:46.516 --> 01:20:48.797]  I mean, that's a giant template they've used.
[01:20:48.877 --> 01:20:57.601]  So you can see, Mike Dunn, where I'm a little concerned, and I see this going on, and I'm worried about the idea of your movement that anybody can say they're a boogaloo.
[01:20:57.641 --> 01:20:59.041]  It's like, are you for anonymous?
[01:20:59.061 --> 01:20:59.962]  Well, anybody can be anonymous.
[01:21:00.242 --> 01:21:00.902]  Are you for Q?
[01:21:00.942 --> 01:21:04.244]  Anybody can be for Q. I mean, don't you worry that...
[01:21:05.424 --> 01:21:08.306]  I'm going to stop ranting here, but explain to me, Boogaloo, where it came from.
[01:21:08.746 --> 01:21:10.187]  Are you worried about being taken over?
[01:21:10.207 --> 01:21:12.089]  I mean, what do you think is really happening here?
[01:21:13.949 --> 01:21:21.093]  Since Boogaloo is an ideology, it's not necessarily a worry of being taken over because if somebody doesn't embody the ideology, then they're not Boogaloo.
[01:21:21.634 --> 01:21:24.916]  Boogaloo started as a meme, a joke, back in like 2012.
[01:21:24.996 --> 01:21:26.256]  It was just an online joke.
[01:21:26.737 --> 01:21:35.382]  And then in 2019, several people started making it a little more public and actually turned it into an ideology or belief that liberty is for all and we're done being tread on.
[01:21:35.682 --> 01:21:38.544]  We're done going the old ways of crying and begging on our knees for
[01:21:39.932 --> 01:21:42.334]  The courts that are already screwed up to help us.
[01:21:43.214 --> 01:21:50.399]  We're tired of trying to vote our way out of a system that is controlled, that is controlled by the globalists that you speak of.
[01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:51.800]  We're tired of it.
[01:21:51.820 --> 01:21:52.901]  And we stood up in 2019.
[01:21:53.301 --> 01:22:00.326]  And then in early 2020, Duncan Lipp, who was a blue-blue boy, was killed in his home as they served a red flag on him saying that he was a risk.
[01:22:00.686 --> 01:22:06.510]  21 years old, a buddy of mine, was murdered in his bed because he had firearms.
[01:22:07.370 --> 01:22:10.213]  And that sparked the Boogaloo movement nationwide.
[01:22:10.393 --> 01:22:12.535]  All of us started taking to the streets and saying, you know what?
[01:22:12.855 --> 01:22:14.416]  We're done hiding behind computer screens.
[01:22:15.517 --> 01:22:16.378]  We're done talking.
[01:22:16.738 --> 01:22:18.360]  We're done doing all of this.
[01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:19.701]  We're going to go out there and take a stand.
[01:22:19.901 --> 01:22:25.366]  And if they want a war, as horrible as war is, if they want a war, let it begin with us.
[01:22:25.406 --> 01:22:26.407]  Because our fathers didn't.
[01:22:26.647 --> 01:22:28.468]  No offense, Alex, but your generation didn't.
[01:22:29.409 --> 01:22:30.150]  And so our children don't
[01:22:31.221 --> 01:22:33.143]  We're going to stand up now and say, this is it.
[01:22:33.444 --> 01:22:34.245]  We're done with the journey.
[01:22:34.285 --> 01:22:34.585]  Sure, sure.
[01:22:34.625 --> 01:22:37.168]  It's like when people say, you haven't been in the military, have you?
[01:22:37.208 --> 01:22:38.029]  So trust the plan.
[01:22:38.850 --> 01:22:40.653]  Look, look, here's my issue.
[01:22:42.771 --> 01:22:45.093]  Are you guys putting out a manifesto of targets?
[01:22:45.273 --> 01:22:52.578]  Because, you know, random police, capitals, that's, I mean, that's just a seat of what the people should be in control of.
[01:22:53.119 --> 01:22:55.560]  I mean, I'm not calling for targets, God forbid, I don't want any violence.
[01:22:56.521 --> 01:22:57.402]  What about Bill Gates?
[01:22:57.462 --> 01:22:58.462]  What about Ted Turner?
[01:22:59.123 --> 01:23:01.124]  What about people trying to put poison vaccines in us?
[01:23:01.164 --> 01:23:01.965]  What about the UN?
[01:23:02.645 --> 01:23:08.790]  So tell me, tell me in a deck of cards, like Saddam Hussein was the top target 2003, like who's the ace of spades for you guys?
[01:23:10.286 --> 01:23:17.270]  It would be ignorant to sit here and release a manifesto or say this is a target... Yeah, so let's not mention any real evil kingpins, right?
[01:23:17.290 --> 01:23:19.491]  I'm not going to allow you to goad me into saying something like that.
[01:23:19.511 --> 01:23:21.552]  Say that again?
[01:23:21.572 --> 01:23:24.954]  I'm not going to allow you to goad me into saying something like that.
[01:23:25.414 --> 01:23:26.394]  That would be ridiculous.
[01:23:26.414 --> 01:23:29.216]  Oh, like the Southern Poverty Law Center does, posing as malicious?
[01:23:29.916 --> 01:23:30.837]  Goading people into stuff?
[01:23:33.348 --> 01:23:34.989]  Oh, maybe I am.
[01:23:35.669 --> 01:23:36.709]  Maybe you're right.
[01:23:37.089 --> 01:23:40.350]  Listen, what I'm telling you is, I want to save this country.
[01:23:41.651 --> 01:23:44.451]  And running around storming capitals is not the way to do it.
[01:23:45.612 --> 01:23:47.992]  Either the courts or not, Alex, the country is not safe.
[01:23:48.012 --> 01:23:48.693]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:23:48.713 --> 01:23:50.913]  Do you have 50 Democratic lawsuits against you?
[01:23:52.434 --> 01:23:52.934]  What say again?
[01:23:53.954 --> 01:23:56.855]  Do you have the Democratic Party financing your destruction like I do?
[01:23:59.795 --> 01:24:00.675]  I don't know, nor do I care.
[01:24:00.695 --> 01:24:01.556]  I'm gonna stand by what I want.
[01:24:01.676 --> 01:24:05.397]  It's the fact that you're doing the same thing that has been done for years, and it's not accomplishing anything.
[01:24:27.779 --> 01:24:30.080]  The only thing that's going to accomplish is forcing a revolution.
[01:24:31.661 --> 01:24:32.861]  I am not doing the same thing.
[01:24:33.001 --> 01:24:34.282]  I'm not Democrat, Republican.
[01:24:34.342 --> 01:24:35.682]  I'm exposing the globalist program.
[01:24:35.703 --> 01:24:37.403]  Do you understand that information is powerful?
[01:24:37.583 --> 01:24:38.164]  They're scared of it?
[01:24:39.784 --> 01:24:40.305]  You're talking.
[01:24:40.545 --> 01:24:41.045]  That's all you're doing.
[01:24:41.065 --> 01:24:42.866]  You're doing the same thing that's been done for years, brother.
[01:24:44.426 --> 01:24:48.968]  Oh, so now you are admitting you told people to storm the Capitol because you're not like me, a coward.
[01:24:48.988 --> 01:24:49.729]  You're a big man.
[01:24:49.769 --> 01:24:50.409]  You were for war.
[01:24:51.369 --> 01:24:52.930]  I have not told anybody to storm the Capitol.
[01:24:53.010 --> 01:24:54.691]  I've preached revolution and I always will.
[01:24:56.101 --> 01:24:57.443]  Well let's raise something.
[01:24:57.583 --> 01:25:02.869]  The Boogaloo Supreme Leadership, whoever they are, said go to D.C.
[01:25:02.909 --> 01:25:06.493]  the weekend after the 6th and have armed marches, but you guys didn't show up.
[01:25:06.794 --> 01:25:09.517]  So you were trying to get other people to come into D.C.
[01:25:09.877 --> 01:25:11.619]  so you could sit back and eat popcorn and watch that.
[01:25:11.739 --> 01:25:13.201]  Or was that not the Boogaloos that said that?
[01:25:14.182 --> 01:25:15.364]  It's the word you like, Alex.
[01:25:15.404 --> 01:25:16.365]  It's called a sign-off, brother.
[01:25:19.039 --> 01:25:19.899]  Oh, a PSYOP.
[01:25:19.919 --> 01:25:28.222]  So you're not going to respond to the stack of tweets I've got and messages from you saying we're going to have an armed march three days after the 6th.
[01:25:29.363 --> 01:25:30.183]  Alex, you're a liar.
[01:25:31.483 --> 01:25:33.624]  Show the tweet where I said we're going to have an armed march for DC.
[01:25:35.285 --> 01:25:36.585]  Show the tweet.
[01:25:36.605 --> 01:25:37.966]  So the Boogaloos did not call.
[01:25:37.986 --> 01:25:40.386]  They didn't say armed march is still on for DC.
[01:25:40.486 --> 01:25:41.327]  We're going to have it.
[01:25:42.187 --> 01:25:45.188]  Show the tweet where I said there's going to be an armed march for DC.
[01:25:45.208 --> 01:25:46.428]  I'm talking about the Boogaloo Lordship.
[01:25:46.448 --> 01:25:47.729]  Well, you said you're not the Lordship.
[01:25:48.854 --> 01:25:55.578]  I said I'm not the leader.
[01:25:55.618 --> 01:25:56.679]  Correct.
[01:25:58.620 --> 01:25:59.040]  I don't care.
[01:25:59.100 --> 01:26:01.682]  I don't care to go to any of those places because I care less about them.
[01:26:02.042 --> 01:26:04.183]  I'm here to stand for what I believe in regardless of the hangings.
[01:26:12.233 --> 01:26:12.934]  No, no, no.
[01:26:12.974 --> 01:26:13.414]  You said you.
[01:26:13.494 --> 01:26:15.015]  You didn't say the boogaloo.
[01:26:15.155 --> 01:26:15.716]  You said you.
[01:26:15.796 --> 01:26:16.757]  Play it back if you want to.
[01:26:16.817 --> 01:26:20.059]  You said you called for an armed march in D.C.
[01:26:20.179 --> 01:26:21.560]  I have tweets where you called for it.
[01:26:21.781 --> 01:26:22.701]  That's why I said you're a liar.
[01:26:22.741 --> 01:26:25.484]  So you've never called for armed marches against capitals, period?
[01:26:26.985 --> 01:26:29.106]  I have said that no armed march in D.C.
[01:26:29.407 --> 01:26:30.367]  An armed march in D.C.
[01:26:30.387 --> 01:26:31.028]  would be unwise.
[01:26:31.068 --> 01:26:32.069]  I've said that repeatedly.
[01:26:32.634 --> 01:26:33.494]  Well good, good for you.
[01:26:33.514 --> 01:26:34.775]  I remember the boogaloo said that.
[01:26:35.175 --> 01:26:36.756]  So wait, I thought you're a man of action though.
[01:26:36.776 --> 01:26:39.557]  You just said that I'm the coward, and you're the big man of action.
[01:26:39.577 --> 01:26:40.017]  Wise action.
[01:26:40.518 --> 01:26:41.218]  Wise action.
[01:26:41.658 --> 01:26:42.319]  Wise action.
[01:26:42.439 --> 01:26:46.100]  I go to capitals where we can punk a police department, punk city council, punk the graffiti.
[01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:48.802]  But you told me earlier that we should not follow the law.
[01:26:49.102 --> 01:26:53.844]  You said I'm a coward, I follow the law, you don't follow the law because you're for revolution.
[01:26:55.213 --> 01:26:55.493]  Correct.
[01:26:55.613 --> 01:27:03.055]  I'm for revolution, but I'm for wise revolution, which is where we go to these capitals, we pump the PDs, we pump the city councils that want to make unlawful costs.
[01:27:03.115 --> 01:27:03.395]  Unlawful.
[01:27:03.736 --> 01:27:05.596]  Yeah, because the local cops are our issue.
[01:27:05.616 --> 01:27:05.856]  All right.
[01:27:05.876 --> 01:27:06.236]  All right.
[01:27:06.556 --> 01:27:09.097]  Hey, you are the Boogaloo, Lordship.
[01:27:09.237 --> 01:27:12.198]  We're going to come right back if you still are here with us.
[01:27:12.558 --> 01:27:21.081]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, Mike Dunn, the Supreme Field Marshal, founder and absolute commander of the Boogaloo's.
[01:27:22.244 --> 01:27:24.425]  I know he's going to say, I'm not the founder, I'm not the leader.
[01:27:24.545 --> 01:27:25.486]  It's called a joke.
[01:27:26.467 --> 01:27:28.588]  But it's like Q or it's like Anonymous.
[01:27:29.488 --> 01:27:31.389]  You never know who the leader is.
[01:27:31.450 --> 01:27:32.570]  It's an ideology.
[01:27:32.630 --> 01:27:33.471]  It's not our fault.
[01:27:34.437 --> 01:27:36.938]  Have any Boogaloos been arrested, Mike Dunn?
[01:27:36.978 --> 01:27:38.258]  Or do you know of any Boogaloos?
[01:27:39.038 --> 01:27:40.359]  I know now you're calling D.C.
[01:27:40.379 --> 01:27:40.799]  the capital.
[01:27:40.819 --> 01:27:42.419]  We've stormed the capital, we're in command.
[01:27:42.799 --> 01:27:44.620]  You mean you're in D.C.
[01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:45.400]  with fireteams.
[01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:46.480]  But if D.C.
[01:27:46.500 --> 01:27:51.102]  doesn't allow you to have guns, you just said you won't violate laws, but I'm a wimp, I don't violate laws.
[01:27:52.142 --> 01:27:55.543]  I'm a wimp, I don't violate laws, but you don't want to violate laws.
[01:27:55.843 --> 01:27:57.484]  We want to be smart about violating laws.
[01:27:57.864 --> 01:28:00.804]  And then you were in the capital, but you weren't in the capital with these fireteams.
[01:28:02.645 --> 01:28:04.066]  Explain it to me, because I'm an honest man.
[01:28:04.106 --> 01:28:05.166]  It's hard to count an honest man.
[01:28:06.407 --> 01:28:09.228]  It's literally right there in front of our Capitol, as in D.C.
[01:28:09.608 --> 01:28:12.089]  Nobody said anything about the Capitol building, number one.
[01:28:12.909 --> 01:28:15.551]  Number two, no Boogaloo boy attends a protest unarmed.
[01:28:15.731 --> 01:28:18.992]  So you can answer your, you can fill in your imaginations as well.
[01:28:19.212 --> 01:28:28.276]  What I said was I would not encourage an open armed march on D.C., which is what I've said repeatedly because I find it a poor tactical plan, a poor strategy.
[01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:36.726]  Um, so I know you like blowing things out of proportion and trying to paint me as the bad guy or paint me as illogical, but I've, I've been consistent with what I'm saying.
[01:28:36.766 --> 01:28:38.268]  You just, you keep trying to twist it out, man.
[01:28:38.308 --> 01:28:49.176]  No, Mike, I'm trying to find out who the guys in camo are that lead the attack with Antifa and then get a few, maybe a hundred idiots to go in with them so that, so that they can destroy a peaceful movement.
[01:28:49.477 --> 01:28:51.778]  I've been around quite a few Antifa.
[01:28:52.239 --> 01:28:54.801]  Um, you know, there are, there are some Antifa that are good.
[01:28:54.841 --> 01:28:56.622]  The majority we've not had good interactions with.
[01:28:56.642 --> 01:28:57.423]  We do not support.
[01:28:58.078 --> 01:29:06.024]  Uh, but there are some that are good, but I've interacted with a lot of Antifa and I can assure you that they were not Antifa that were on that front line in that capital, uh, that capital riot.
[01:29:06.364 --> 01:29:11.008]  So trying to find somebody to point fingers at, um, you're, you're failing when you're pointing at Antifa.
[01:29:11.028 --> 01:29:11.568]  They were not there.
[01:29:11.868 --> 01:29:12.709]  Oh, I'm failing.
[01:29:12.769 --> 01:29:15.891]  Even though they arrested an Antifa leader that said he brought a hundred there.
[01:29:15.931 --> 01:29:18.493]  I saw a bunch of skinny jean guys helping do it.
[01:29:18.633 --> 01:29:19.874]  Oh, so this was all Trump people.
[01:29:20.575 --> 01:29:23.717]  Yeah, it's, it's called, it's called an op Alex, the same thing that you preach about.
[01:29:25.916 --> 01:29:26.436]  What's an op?
[01:29:26.556 --> 01:29:26.856]  It's not.
[01:29:27.576 --> 01:29:28.137]  It's not.
[01:29:28.157 --> 01:29:29.537]  It's simply not true.
[01:29:33.518 --> 01:29:36.459]  Oh, so, okay, so should Trump be arrested for inciting this?
[01:29:38.639 --> 01:29:40.740]  I think there are a lot of other crimes that Trump should be arrested for.
[01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:45.281]  I don't believe he incited the insurrection at the Capitol, no, but I believe there's a lot of other crimes he should be arrested for.
[01:29:48.222 --> 01:29:51.122]  So, have you ever met, have you ever talked to Southern Poverty Law Center?
[01:29:54.122 --> 01:29:54.884]  I don't believe so.
[01:29:54.904 --> 01:29:56.146]  Maybe I talk to a lot of people.
[01:29:56.166 --> 01:29:58.790]  A lot of people call me, ask questions, reporters, agencies.
[01:29:59.191 --> 01:29:59.772]  I have no clue.
[01:30:01.735 --> 01:30:03.599]  Owen, you want to put any bookends on this?
[01:30:03.759 --> 01:30:05.882]  I mean, I just, this is just a mess.
[01:30:06.957 --> 01:30:07.758]  Yeah, here's the deal.
[01:30:09.539 --> 01:30:11.981]  I think we're obsessing a little bit too much over January 6th.
[01:30:12.461 --> 01:30:15.803]  You had Democrat riots, $2.2 billion in property damage.
[01:30:15.843 --> 01:30:19.286]  Most of it, if not all of it, private businesses, aside from maybe a couple government entities.
[01:30:19.346 --> 01:30:21.367]  I know there was a police station in Seattle.
[01:30:21.988 --> 01:30:23.909]  And that barely gets scolded by the media.
[01:30:23.989 --> 01:30:24.770]  So here's the problem.
[01:30:25.330 --> 01:30:29.173]  We are not in a position to launch any sort of kinetic war.
[01:30:29.554 --> 01:30:35.119]  Most of the population in America doesn't have a clue what's going on, and the media will turn them against you as soon as you do that.
[01:30:35.179 --> 01:30:36.660]  January 6th is the perfect example.
[01:30:36.700 --> 01:30:37.941]  So, here's my problem.
[01:30:38.321 --> 01:30:40.823]  We are now out of the age of the Trump presidency.
[01:30:40.924 --> 01:30:42.305]  The polarization of that is done.
[01:30:42.705 --> 01:30:49.947]  I couldn't go interact or interface with BLM or Antifa without being attacked, them calling me racist, all this stuff, because I support Trump.
[01:30:50.007 --> 01:30:50.587]  Oh, I'm a Nazi.
[01:30:50.787 --> 01:30:51.247]  Well, I'm not.
[01:30:51.467 --> 01:30:52.548]  I never was any of that stuff.
[01:30:52.808 --> 01:30:54.888]  So now I'm saying we all need to be unified.
[01:30:54.908 --> 01:30:56.209]  We're all anti-establishment.
[01:30:56.249 --> 01:30:57.769]  I think we can all agree the media is corrupt.
[01:30:57.929 --> 01:30:59.450]  We can all agree politicians are corrupt.
[01:30:59.730 --> 01:31:00.850]  So now we have to become unified.
[01:31:00.870 --> 01:31:01.970]  So now we have to become unified.
[01:31:01.990 --> 01:31:06.892]  So we can organize against the wars, against the surveillance, against the mask, against the forced inoculation.
[01:31:07.212 --> 01:31:08.372]  I think that's a positive thing.
[01:31:08.972 --> 01:31:10.272]  Let me ask Lord Boogaloo.
[01:31:10.713 --> 01:31:12.013]  Do you agree with that, Lord Boogaloo?
[01:31:13.115 --> 01:31:14.657]  So I'm 100% clear.
[01:31:15.198 --> 01:31:18.502]  You're cool with the tyranny if it's the tyranny that you like, which would be Donald Trump.
[01:31:18.742 --> 01:31:20.024]  I just want to make sure I'm tracking on that.
[01:31:20.384 --> 01:31:21.846]  So you're not actually against tyranny.
[01:31:21.886 --> 01:31:23.167]  You're not actually for revolution.
[01:31:23.488 --> 01:31:26.692]  You're only for doing it when somebody is in office that you don't agree with.
[01:31:26.932 --> 01:31:27.733]  Wait a minute.
[01:31:27.793 --> 01:31:28.334]  Wait a minute.
[01:31:28.414 --> 01:31:31.377]  I just talked about all of us unifying against forced inoculations.
[01:31:31.437 --> 01:31:31.898]  Joe Biden.
[01:31:31.958 --> 01:31:32.519]  Trump's gone.
[01:31:33.784 --> 01:31:36.705]  You wouldn't do it while Trump was in office because you didn't stand against Trump.
[01:31:36.965 --> 01:31:38.065]  You stood for the very time.
[01:31:38.085 --> 01:31:39.005]  I didn't stand around.
[01:31:39.025 --> 01:31:44.406]  I didn't stand around with a gun in front of stuff and say, hold on.
[01:31:44.466 --> 01:31:46.567]  That's another cheap shot, Mr. Fireteam.
[01:31:47.547 --> 01:31:49.607]  We have fireteams in the Capitol.
[01:31:49.987 --> 01:31:51.688]  We have taken the Capitol.
[01:31:51.728 --> 01:31:53.688]  We are Commando Base Delta.
[01:31:54.308 --> 01:31:54.728]  Come on.
[01:31:54.868 --> 01:31:56.169]  Don't get mad, Mr. Dunn.
[01:31:56.189 --> 01:31:57.369]  We're back in 60 seconds.
[01:31:58.869 --> 01:31:59.309]  I tell ya.
[01:31:59.329 --> 01:32:03.070]  Alright, we got Mike Dunn.
[01:32:04.783 --> 01:32:12.399]  One of the most prominent Boogaloos with us, and again he goes, oh you sell products, you're discredited.
[01:32:13.363 --> 01:32:14.584]  That sounds like a communist statement.
[01:32:15.024 --> 01:32:18.726]  And then he, oh, we've got security for BLM, but we don't like the Proud Boys.
[01:32:19.407 --> 01:32:20.647]  And so he does these cheap shots.
[01:32:20.707 --> 01:32:22.108]  I was pretty nice to him earlier.
[01:32:22.128 --> 01:32:24.670]  I brought up some of his quotes and some of the things he said.
[01:32:24.690 --> 01:32:29.953]  And then I was simply, you know, coming out and saying, I don't think the attack on the Capitol was good.
[01:32:30.213 --> 01:32:31.434]  He overall, I think, agreed with that.
[01:32:31.474 --> 01:32:36.517]  But then, you know, came back that I'm just not willing to get my hands dirty because I'm a coward.
[01:32:38.057 --> 01:32:41.700]  But he said he doesn't support a Capitol attack because there's a law, you know, against guns in D.C.
[01:32:43.254 --> 01:32:48.756]  But then he kind of said that I was causing a problem.
[01:32:48.796 --> 01:32:52.317]  So I just wanted you to have some final comments.
[01:32:52.337 --> 01:32:53.758]  Hey, dude, if you're going to talk, close that door.
[01:32:53.798 --> 01:32:54.058]  Thanks.
[01:32:55.118 --> 01:32:56.259]  So that's where we are.
[01:32:56.339 --> 01:32:59.140]  Listen, I don't have a hard-on for the Boogaloos.
[01:33:01.160 --> 01:33:02.921]  I'm not against people doing open carry.
[01:33:02.941 --> 01:33:05.662]  I think it's a good idea to exercise our First Amendment, our Second Amendment.
[01:33:07.096 --> 01:33:08.237]  Both together at the same time.
[01:33:09.419 --> 01:33:20.533]  It's just that I really don't think a badly coordinated, sporadic shooting war with the local police is going to really put our revolution off on a good foot.
[01:33:21.133 --> 01:33:22.755]  And I know you're going to say that's not what you're part of.
[01:33:23.556 --> 01:33:32.238]  Uh, it's just, I'm simply here asking, if there were Boogaloos at the Capitol that day, and Boogaloos are telling us they're leading the way for revolution, you can't have it both ways.
[01:33:32.278 --> 01:33:39.020]  Like, were they leading the revolution in there, as the tweets could be seen as, or were they not leading it, and now they're not following the ideology they said they're part of?
[01:33:39.040 --> 01:33:44.741]  Uh, I would like to respond to what Owen Shade said before the break, because sometimes you don't like to say things that you don't mean.
[01:33:44.761 --> 01:33:45.401]  Yes, Lord Boogaloo, go ahead.
[01:33:46.441 --> 01:33:47.041]  You're all phone.
[01:33:47.541 --> 01:33:50.002]  So, um, basically,
[01:33:51.110 --> 01:33:52.871]  Owen was talking about.
[01:33:52.971 --> 01:33:53.832]  Owen, could you refresh that?
[01:33:53.852 --> 01:33:55.794]  Because now I just lost my train of thought.
[01:33:56.775 --> 01:33:57.636]  Well, let me just be clear.
[01:33:57.656 --> 01:34:03.281]  You were saying, oh, you only support it when your guy's not in office.
[01:34:03.602 --> 01:34:04.462]  It's not that.
[01:34:05.443 --> 01:34:06.164]  But let me be clear.
[01:34:06.264 --> 01:34:06.825]  It's not that.
[01:34:07.045 --> 01:34:09.788]  I believe that Trump was hoped that we could do it peacefully.
[01:34:10.128 --> 01:34:13.131]  I believe that Trump was hoped that we could do it politically from within.
[01:34:13.431 --> 01:34:13.992]  He's out now.
[01:34:14.032 --> 01:34:14.833]  So that hope's gone.
[01:34:15.433 --> 01:34:16.093]  So that's what I'm saying.
[01:34:16.113 --> 01:34:17.074]  Now we're in a new age.
[01:34:17.354 --> 01:34:21.957]  We should all be unifying, having real intellectual debates about what a revolution looks like to save this country.
[01:34:21.977 --> 01:34:23.678]  Yeah, what was the Trump fascism?
[01:34:23.838 --> 01:34:24.519]  Like Trump's gone.
[01:34:24.539 --> 01:34:27.120]  It's like, you support Trump and his police state.
[01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:28.481]  What the hell does that mean?
[01:34:28.501 --> 01:34:36.806]  Oh, and until you vote, you vote somebody else in that continues to do the same thing while saying, hey, we're against voter fraud, but then actually
[01:34:37.288 --> 01:34:37.508]  Thank you.
[01:34:51.325 --> 01:34:52.446]  That's not fair though.
[01:34:52.566 --> 01:34:55.309]  I didn't work with Black Lives Matter, you did Boogie Lou!
[01:35:09.830 --> 01:35:10.631]  Mike, that's not fair.
[01:35:11.091 --> 01:35:12.472]  I had nothing against these groups.
[01:35:12.513 --> 01:35:12.893]  I'm telling you.
[01:35:13.313 --> 01:35:14.935]  I would go out to try to talk to them.
[01:35:15.075 --> 01:35:15.735]  I'm on video.
[01:35:15.836 --> 01:35:17.357]  Hours of video where I try to talk to them.
[01:35:17.557 --> 01:35:18.358]  They call me a Nazi.
[01:35:18.378 --> 01:35:19.159]  They call me racist.
[01:35:19.499 --> 01:35:21.020]  So, I mean, what am I supposed to do?
[01:35:21.160 --> 01:35:23.002]  I did try the unity when Trump was in office.
[01:35:23.803 --> 01:35:25.905]  Hey, Owen, they've called me the same thing.
[01:35:25.965 --> 01:35:29.989]  It's all in the way you portray yourself and how you... Let's ask this question in closing.
[01:35:30.109 --> 01:35:31.190]  Let's ask this question...
[01:35:32.401 --> 01:35:33.583]  Of the Grand Boogaloo.
[01:35:34.183 --> 01:35:36.426]  What comes next in the Boogaloo universe?
[01:35:36.506 --> 01:35:38.629]  Or is there no... It's an ideology.
[01:35:38.889 --> 01:35:39.550]  Who creates?
[01:35:39.590 --> 01:35:40.531]  Who's the high priest?
[01:35:40.932 --> 01:35:44.296]  Who creates the ideology or does it just flow forth from where?
[01:35:45.859 --> 01:35:56.465]  It's autonomous, and the next thing is unity, unifying the lower bodies, the people that are subject to this globalism that you speak of, and this elitist mentality that is running the U.S.
[01:35:56.505 --> 01:35:58.526]  through our governmental officials.
[01:35:58.986 --> 01:36:05.569]  It's unifying those people and getting ready to stand physically to defend our rights, our life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:36:06.550 --> 01:36:09.171]  Well, I mean, I think people have a right to stand up, and I think they should.
[01:36:09.531 --> 01:36:10.092]  Let me ask you this.
[01:36:10.112 --> 01:36:11.573]  Have you been contacted by the FBI?
[01:36:13.654 --> 01:36:14.194]  Yes, I have.
[01:36:15.328 --> 01:36:18.731]  You're not, you're not, there's a joke in the book Lou that you're not who Lou is.
[01:36:18.972 --> 01:36:20.193]  You know, you haven't been questioned.
[01:36:20.714 --> 01:36:23.657]  So the FBI has been all over us.
[01:36:23.677 --> 01:36:25.199]  So what'd the FBI say?
[01:36:25.219 --> 01:36:26.040]  What'd they come to you about?
[01:36:28.022 --> 01:36:29.464]  They like asking questions.
[01:36:29.664 --> 01:36:30.064]  That's all.
[01:36:30.104 --> 01:36:31.606]  And I don't like giving them answers.
[01:36:31.666 --> 01:36:34.109]  So if that paints a good picture for you, I hope it does.
[01:36:36.872 --> 01:36:44.455]  Well, I just think what happened at the Capitol was called screwing the pooch, and it ruined the great thing we had set up, and it gave the left a major victory.
[01:36:44.735 --> 01:36:48.056]  What do you think of the Q movement, Mr. Dunn?
[01:36:48.076 --> 01:36:51.037]  I think a lot of it is found in baseless conspiracies.
[01:36:51.177 --> 01:36:57.379]  I think there are one or two things that might be true, but for the most part, it's just a baseless conspiracy idea.
[01:37:00.520 --> 01:37:04.341]  Well, I get a group of armed Americans that are non-political and just want their freedom.
[01:37:04.381 --> 01:37:06.002]  So I get the need for that.
[01:37:06.022 --> 01:37:13.084]  I just think that you guys are kind of putting yourselves in uniform, like the last uniform you want is one that stands out.
[01:37:13.805 --> 01:37:17.686]  And then anybody can put on a Hawaiian shirt and go out and do terrible things.
[01:37:18.026 --> 01:37:20.087]  And I think like the Cubans or anything.
[01:37:21.347 --> 01:37:23.268]  To a certain extent, Alex, I do agree with you there.
[01:37:23.388 --> 01:37:25.969]  The thing is, though, is that
[01:37:26.420 --> 01:37:30.703]  And once again, no offense to you directly, but your generation and the ones before you, they put it on my generation's heads.
[01:37:31.063 --> 01:37:32.044]  And so we have to stand up.
[01:37:32.084 --> 01:37:36.226]  So if you haven't solved the problem, you can't come at us for trying to solve the problem a different way.
[01:37:36.927 --> 01:37:38.147]  Um, you, you cannot.
[01:37:38.568 --> 01:37:40.129]  I mean, so, so, so.
[01:37:41.790 --> 01:37:42.030]  Okay.
[01:37:42.290 --> 01:37:43.251]  I'm just saying the local.
[01:37:44.386 --> 01:37:46.306]  The Capitol is a symbol of us voting.
[01:37:46.346 --> 01:37:48.407]  Just because it's been captured doesn't mean we attack that.
[01:37:49.047 --> 01:37:50.207]  The New World Order.
[01:37:50.227 --> 01:37:51.508]  I'm not trying to get you to go attack people.
[01:37:51.548 --> 01:38:00.870]  I'm just saying, if I saw a movement saying we're going after Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab and the Rothschilds, the New World Order, and the CFR building in New York, I'd say those guys are real and they're about to get a fight.
[01:38:01.690 --> 01:38:06.951]  Because about 10 minutes after you said that, they would be having the HRT SWAT teams will be coming after your ass.
[01:38:07.212 --> 01:38:08.772]  Within a day, you're going to get SWAT teamed.
[01:38:09.952 --> 01:38:11.153]  Alex, what have I said repeatedly?
[01:38:11.213 --> 01:38:15.634]  I have said repeatedly that we stand against the globalists and the elites that continue to control this country.
[01:38:15.654 --> 01:38:19.736]  So when you're saying, oh, if I saw people that went after that, we literally stand against it.
[01:38:19.776 --> 01:38:21.937]  We stand against the pedophilia that's prevalent in Hollywood.
[01:38:22.017 --> 01:38:24.618]  We stand against media controlling people.
[01:38:24.658 --> 01:38:26.379]  We stand against the elitists that run our government.
[01:38:26.399 --> 01:38:28.039]  We stand against the money that run our government.
[01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:31.501]  It's just that we're doing it in a slightly different way than what you agree with.
[01:38:31.941 --> 01:38:46.390]  All I wanted to come on here and say, Alex, if you'll allow me to finish real quick, all I wanted to come on here and say, man, is these people out there putting in the work, you know, you call them CIA ops, you said release the boogaloo, you know, you like to make your jokes, but these people are legitimate people who are putting in the work and believing in what they stand for.
[01:38:47.111 --> 01:38:53.034]  There are people in the boogaloo movement who don't agree with me, there are people in the boogaloo movement who are different than me, but these people are putting in work.
[01:38:53.054 --> 01:38:57.277]  They're not CIA ops, they don't work for the CIA, they're not unwitting CIA sources.
[01:38:57.831 --> 01:39:01.036]  Um, and they're not controlled opposition, like sometimes you appear to be.
[01:39:01.377 --> 01:39:03.420]  We are legitimate people who believe in what we stand for.
[01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:03.940]  That's all.
[01:39:03.960 --> 01:39:05.823]  Oh, I'm controlled opposition.
[01:39:05.843 --> 01:39:07.386]  Or you are, Alex.
[01:39:07.406 --> 01:39:08.367]  You think I'm controlled.
[01:39:08.768 --> 01:39:09.589]  Who gives me my orders?
[01:39:09.669 --> 01:39:10.130]  Please tell me.
[01:39:11.670 --> 01:39:14.111]  I do believe you're a 100% controlled opposition, Alex.
[01:39:14.431 --> 01:39:22.394]  That's why you'll never preach anything besides peaceful and legal, lawful, wonderful, hunky-dory ways of protest.
[01:39:22.534 --> 01:39:34.698]  Okay, so I'm not the one saying we got fire teams in the Capitol, and then you guys haven't been indicted, and then they're trying to indict me, and then you're sitting there literally saying I'm getting orders from a higher-level group, which is not the case.
[01:39:35.439 --> 01:39:36.279]  Look at my eyes.
[01:39:36.539 --> 01:39:37.940]  I take orders from God, that's it.
[01:39:38.020 --> 01:39:38.460]  You understand that?
[01:39:39.735 --> 01:39:42.577]  You fired the one good man you had, and that was David Knight.
[01:39:43.058 --> 01:39:44.859]  I do believe you're a controlled opposition, Alex.
[01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:49.563]  So, that's all I came on to say.
[01:39:49.623 --> 01:39:51.885]  David Knight does not support offensive violence.
[01:39:51.905 --> 01:39:53.226]  I mean, I like David.
[01:39:53.526 --> 01:39:55.187]  David did not like our support of Trump.
[01:39:55.247 --> 01:39:56.628]  He was upset, that's why I let him go.
[01:39:57.689 --> 01:39:59.231]  Other way around, he wasn't happy here.
[01:39:59.251 --> 01:40:00.952]  Once again, I...
[01:40:02.184 --> 01:40:05.545]  Let me just say this.
[01:40:05.805 --> 01:40:08.725]  I've worked at Infowars for five years.
[01:40:08.885 --> 01:40:12.186]  I can guarantee you there's nobody controlling Alex Jones.
[01:40:12.306 --> 01:40:14.667]  I've had screaming matches with Alex Jones about stuff.
[01:40:14.907 --> 01:40:15.867]  Okay, so trust me.
[01:40:16.127 --> 01:40:17.567]  Nobody controls what goes on here.
[01:40:17.807 --> 01:40:19.208]  Half the time we're like Joe Biden.
[01:40:19.248 --> 01:40:20.688]  We can't even put a pen in our pocket.
[01:40:20.968 --> 01:40:22.308]  Okay, that's how real this is.
[01:40:22.728 --> 01:40:25.089]  Now guys, we need to stop bickering about all this crap.
[01:40:25.109 --> 01:40:26.489]  This is exactly what the globalists want.
[01:40:26.869 --> 01:40:27.549]  We need unity.
[01:40:27.589 --> 01:40:29.110]  I say, oh, you want unity under Biden.
[01:40:29.570 --> 01:40:31.011]  I believe Trump, we could have peace.
[01:40:31.151 --> 01:40:32.111]  I believe Trump, we could do this.
[01:40:32.131 --> 01:40:33.192]  He tried to stop wars.
[01:40:33.432 --> 01:40:34.252]  He did stop the wars.
[01:40:34.272 --> 01:40:35.133]  He didn't start any new wars.
[01:40:35.353 --> 01:40:36.293]  Trump did some good things.
[01:40:36.613 --> 01:40:38.494]  So it's not to sit here and say, oh, it's just when Biden's.
[01:40:38.774 --> 01:40:40.455]  I've never been a violent revolutionary.
[01:40:40.775 --> 01:40:42.636]  I've been arrested for my peaceful protest.
[01:40:42.916 --> 01:40:53.880]  I'm calling for, we have to awaken 50 million, 100 million, 200 million Americans before you can ever even think about doing a finger lick of violence in this country and have a chance at victory.
[01:40:54.080 --> 01:40:54.941]  That's all I'm saying.
[01:40:55.481 --> 01:40:56.141]  Well, it doesn't matter.
[01:40:56.181 --> 01:40:59.043]  We've done some good radio here and had some thought-provoking things.
[01:40:59.623 --> 01:41:01.404]  And, Don, I'm not going to do cheap shots like you did.
[01:41:01.444 --> 01:41:05.286]  I think you're a well-spoken person, and I think you believe what you're saying.
[01:41:06.226 --> 01:41:10.548]  And so we'll continue to watch the situation as it unfolds, and I appreciate you coming up here and defending your ideas.
[01:41:10.568 --> 01:41:11.408]  That's all I can say.
[01:41:11.468 --> 01:41:14.030]  But, yeah, it's pretty hilarious.
[01:41:14.070 --> 01:41:15.350]  No, I built this whole thing myself.
[01:41:15.410 --> 01:41:16.191]  I did it with our listeners.
[01:41:16.611 --> 01:41:21.333]  And I'm so proud of the fact that I'm independent, and I don't trust people that aren't independent, and that's what we're all about.
[01:41:21.733 --> 01:41:26.954]  All right, we got Pete Santilli chiming in, then we got Leo Zagami on the fall of the Italian government.
[01:41:26.974 --> 01:41:28.035]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[01:41:30.215 --> 01:41:45.399]  Okay, so we just had Mike Dunn, the leader of the Boogaloo Boys, on for a lengthy, hour-long interview, and he didn't deny that these are his tweets and his parlor comments, but he says when they said they were in the capital, they meant the capital of D.C.
[01:41:46.199 --> 01:41:48.120]  Well, funny, he doesn't deny these are his.
[01:41:48.300 --> 01:41:49.000]  On screen, please.
[01:41:50.956 --> 01:41:51.557]  Listen to this.
[01:41:51.597 --> 01:41:52.397]  Scroll down, guys.
[01:41:52.477 --> 01:41:52.918]  Parler.
[01:41:54.900 --> 01:41:56.000]  He deleted all this later.
[01:41:56.241 --> 01:41:57.702]  The Last Sons of Liberty.
[01:41:58.683 --> 01:41:59.504]  Official statement.
[01:42:00.244 --> 01:42:07.390]  Boogaloo Boys associated with the Last Sons of Liberty played an important part in the breach of the Capitol.
[01:42:07.531 --> 01:42:14.176]  Any movement to be used to throw a middle finger to tyranny should be capitalized on.
[01:42:16.158 --> 01:42:16.759]  Yesterday,
[01:42:18.103 --> 01:42:26.250]  When presented with the moment, Undercover Boys went to work to hype up the people.
[01:42:26.910 --> 01:42:37.859]  Working alongside other Last Sons not being solely responsible for the events that took place, a breach was made in the building which is rightfully ours to walk in as we please.
[01:42:38.719 --> 01:42:39.920]  Because our tax was made for it.
[01:42:40.901 --> 01:42:45.305]  The video posted is pieced from several others of Boys
[01:42:46.732 --> 01:42:49.913]  Who provided Overwatch along with direction.
[01:42:49.973 --> 01:42:58.476]  This video does not incriminate anyone of ours and wasn't sent to us, was sent to us by anonymous by Last Son's Boogaloo Boys.
[01:42:58.816 --> 01:43:02.217]  This is our footage, Mike Dunn.
[01:43:02.297 --> 01:43:03.478]  And he didn't deny that's his.
[01:43:03.978 --> 01:43:06.499]  So, he lied in front of everyone.
[01:43:08.339 --> 01:43:09.620]  He's a disgusting little rat.
[01:43:10.840 --> 01:43:12.681]  And I challenged him to come back on the show tomorrow.
[01:43:14.568 --> 01:43:17.351]  Because I meant to get to this and I forgot about it while it was on.
[01:43:18.392 --> 01:43:23.997]  And so these guys all have these illusions of grandeur that all these armed people are under them and oh they've got all this power and all this.
[01:43:24.057 --> 01:43:33.946]  They gave a home run devastating defeat to what Trump and I wanted, who he admits he hates, to try to have a 10-day investigation of election fraud that we all need as Americans.
[01:43:34.787 --> 01:43:36.409]  And then he calls it cowardly
[01:43:37.466 --> 01:43:40.107]  Just like Pchenix on, he goes, you've never been in the military.
[01:43:40.447 --> 01:43:43.988]  Trump will still be in January 20th, you don't know.
[01:43:44.288 --> 01:43:47.189]  Same guy like, you're a generation failed, I'm a commando.
[01:43:47.269 --> 01:43:49.169]  I'm doing all this stuff, give me a break.
[01:43:49.189 --> 01:43:53.111]  In fact, I challenge Mike Dunne to a bare knuckles boxing match in a ring.
[01:43:53.491 --> 01:43:54.331]  I'm 47, he's 27.
[01:43:54.431 --> 01:43:57.472]  I mean, he thinks he's so fricking tough all day long.
[01:43:57.772 --> 01:43:59.052]  Let's do it and give the money to charity.
[01:43:59.533 --> 01:44:04.234]  I am so sick of all these wannabe tough guys running their fat mouths all day about how badass they are.
[01:44:05.796 --> 01:44:09.118]  Now does that mean I want to go to war with every person in the boogaloo movement?
[01:44:09.178 --> 01:44:12.841]  No, but you're being manipulated like the feds did to the militias in the 1990s.
[01:44:14.781 --> 01:44:24.043]  And I do not respect that type of crap right there when he said they went in that Capitol and they were proud of it and he deleted it now to sit there and lie to every one of us.
[01:44:24.483 --> 01:44:25.323]  It's disgusting.
[01:44:25.603 --> 01:44:26.863]  And I wish I'd have said it when he was on.
[01:44:26.903 --> 01:44:27.763]  I forgot to get to that.
[01:44:28.324 --> 01:44:29.084]  Holy Toledo.
[01:44:29.584 --> 01:44:37.325]  Owen Schroeder, we got Pete Santilli coming on, who they tried to set up as a journalist and put in prison with the whole Bundy Ranch and then the Oregon situation.
[01:44:37.625 --> 01:44:38.565]  We'll go to him in a moment.
[01:44:38.945 --> 01:44:41.146]  But holy hell, I'd forgotten all this.
[01:44:41.846 --> 01:44:44.372]  I mean, he's right there saying this is a great thing.
[01:44:44.613 --> 01:44:46.217]  And maybe he's right in his view.
[01:44:46.437 --> 01:44:48.442]  But don't lie to us and tell us it's not the case.
[01:44:49.031 --> 01:44:52.474]  Oh, but Alex, don't forget, you're controlled opposition, so what can I say here?
[01:44:52.554 --> 01:44:54.375]  No, look, I'll be honest with you, Alex.
[01:44:54.615 --> 01:44:59.059]  Well, climb in the ring with the controlled opposition and see what happens to your ass.
[01:44:59.139 --> 01:45:01.981]  I'm being facetious here, I'm being facetious, but Alex, I'll be honest.
[01:45:02.842 --> 01:45:07.025]  I think you're being a little too hard on Mike, and I'm not disagreeing with the fact you're laying out.
[01:45:07.205 --> 01:45:11.949]  I just feel that we're discounting one fact here because we've been so gaslit by the media
[01:45:12.529 --> 01:45:15.570]  That you do have a million and a half Trump supporters out there.
[01:45:15.950 --> 01:45:19.791]  I'm not even talking about the Boogaloo Boys or whatever they did that day.
[01:45:19.871 --> 01:45:22.571]  I'm talking about a million and a half Trump people that were in D.C.
[01:45:22.891 --> 01:45:26.132]  I'm talking about probably 75 million plus minimum.
[01:45:26.532 --> 01:45:28.033]  Maybe even 100 million people voted for Trump.
[01:45:28.053 --> 01:45:29.933]  I'm not even kidding you with how much election fraud.
[01:45:30.313 --> 01:45:31.813]  That know our election was stolen.
[01:45:32.273 --> 01:45:33.914]  And for them, this is like...
[01:45:34.614 --> 01:45:37.357]  This is like a wave of the reality hitting them.
[01:45:37.497 --> 01:45:38.518]  No, no, I agree.
[01:45:38.558 --> 01:45:39.660]  People should be pissed.
[01:45:39.720 --> 01:45:42.623]  I'm not surprised they stormed the Capitol and tricked our folks to do it.
[01:45:42.663 --> 01:45:43.003]  I get it.
[01:45:43.043 --> 01:45:43.604]  We bet.
[01:45:43.684 --> 01:45:44.625]  Pedophiles everywhere.
[01:45:44.965 --> 01:45:45.446]  New Old Order.
[01:45:45.526 --> 01:45:46.947]  I get his point if he's legitimate.
[01:45:46.967 --> 01:45:47.588]  Maybe he's real.
[01:45:48.069 --> 01:45:48.389]  Okay?
[01:45:48.709 --> 01:45:52.533]  And he has a perspective, a Declaration of Independence, and maybe he's right.
[01:45:52.814 --> 01:45:56.418]  I'm just saying, don't claim you went to the Capitol and did all this, and then later tell us you didn't.
[01:45:57.554 --> 01:46:00.215]  Yeah, I think, I mean, he's going to have to speak for himself and his actions.
[01:46:00.296 --> 01:46:02.877]  I don't know what, there may be an investigation into him or not.
[01:46:02.937 --> 01:46:04.158]  I'm not trying to get him in trouble.
[01:46:04.198 --> 01:46:06.399]  The worst these people deserve is a trespassing thing.
[01:46:06.419 --> 01:46:07.299]  They're not terrorists.
[01:46:08.120 --> 01:46:13.303]  Yeah, and so, but see, that's the question here, and I don't know if he's had to go through this intellectually if he's made statements.
[01:46:13.643 --> 01:46:14.563]  We've been there.
[01:46:14.583 --> 01:46:17.205]  I mean, you've got to ask yourself a question and make a decision.
[01:46:17.225 --> 01:46:18.466]  I've had to do this multiple times.
[01:46:18.786 --> 01:46:20.507]  Are you willing to go to jail?
[01:46:21.227 --> 01:46:25.631]  Are you willing to go to jail for something, and do you think it'll have a lasting impact?
[01:46:25.952 --> 01:46:28.154]  Or better yet, are you willing to die?
[01:46:28.574 --> 01:46:31.797]  And do you think your death will have a lasting impact, or will you have died in vain?
[01:46:32.218 --> 01:46:37.943]  I mean, so these are the questions that are at the top of this intellectual debate, and at the bottom is, hey, how can we have unity?
[01:46:37.983 --> 01:46:39.745]  How can I come together with the Boogaloo Boys?
[01:46:39.765 --> 01:46:41.307]  How can I come together with Black Lives Matter?
[01:46:41.327 --> 01:46:42.608]  How can I come together with Antifa?
[01:46:42.768 --> 01:46:44.630]  Yeah, I believe Trump was going to have a chance.
[01:46:44.650 --> 01:46:45.531]  We have a giant Peck review fight?
[01:46:45.951 --> 01:46:48.493]  You fight the Antifa champion, I fight Mike Dunn.
[01:46:49.054 --> 01:46:53.477]  And then we clink glasses and realize, you know what, we're all anti-establishment, maybe we're not so bad.
[01:46:54.498 --> 01:46:55.399]  Mike accepts!
[01:46:57.537 --> 01:46:58.678]  Well, hey, you know what?
[01:46:58.718 --> 01:47:00.099]  I've been trying to do political boxing.
[01:47:00.319 --> 01:47:00.959]  See, but here's the problem.
[01:47:00.979 --> 01:47:01.900]  That's my point, though, Alex.
[01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:04.061]  At least he comes on air.
[01:47:04.081 --> 01:47:05.422]  At least they come on air.
[01:47:05.442 --> 01:47:07.503]  I've been watching the Jake Paul and his brother.
[01:47:07.523 --> 01:47:08.163]  I want to do this.
[01:47:08.344 --> 01:47:08.884]  I mean, honestly.
[01:47:08.904 --> 01:47:11.445]  I ain't got to fight like some championship badass black dude.
[01:47:11.706 --> 01:47:13.166]  I got to fight little Tubby Bubby.
[01:47:13.627 --> 01:47:14.067]  I'm ready.
[01:47:14.747 --> 01:47:16.248]  But Alex, at least he comes on air.
[01:47:16.408 --> 01:47:17.849]  We played the clip of Joy Reid.
[01:47:18.089 --> 01:47:19.170]  You showed Jim Acosta.
[01:47:19.210 --> 01:47:20.531]  You showed Anderson Cooper.
[01:47:20.571 --> 01:47:21.391]  You showed Don Lemon.
[01:47:21.411 --> 01:47:22.352]  You showed Rachel Maddow.
[01:47:22.452 --> 01:47:23.853]  Those are the cowards.
[01:47:24.213 --> 01:47:25.474]  Those are the frauds.
[01:47:25.794 --> 01:47:26.995]  Those are the liars.
[01:47:27.355 --> 01:47:30.757]  Those are the enemies of free speech, the enemies of truth, and the enemies of America.
[01:47:31.057 --> 01:47:32.438]  I'm not calling for violence against them.
[01:47:32.718 --> 01:47:33.718]  I want to expose them.
[01:47:33.918 --> 01:47:39.901]  That's why they censor us on the internet, because they know that's the path to real victory, is exposing them and uniting the people against them.
[01:47:40.822 --> 01:47:43.003]  I agree, but what state has legal bare knuckles boxing?
[01:47:43.463 --> 01:47:45.024]  I think Texas has mutual combat.
[01:47:46.084 --> 01:47:48.365]  We do?
[01:47:48.526 --> 01:47:48.786]  Alright.
[01:47:48.986 --> 01:47:51.687]  I'll get worn out with some gloves, but as long as it's bare knuckles, I'm not worried.
[01:47:52.367 --> 01:47:54.789]  I don't know, there's states that still have mutual combat laws.
[01:47:56.311 --> 01:47:56.711]  I agree.
[01:47:56.791 --> 01:47:57.672]  I will take on Cenk Uygur.
[01:48:16.687 --> 01:48:18.428]  By the way, this is all a joke, folks.
[01:48:18.448 --> 01:48:19.149]  I'm scared of Mike Dunn.
[01:48:19.169 --> 01:48:20.630]  One look at him, at a fundamental level,
[01:48:44.719 --> 01:48:46.200]  I like, deep down, I get scared.
[01:48:46.721 --> 01:48:47.782]  Well, Alex, here's my thing.
[01:48:48.162 --> 01:48:49.163]  I love... I'm backing out.
[01:48:49.183 --> 01:48:49.863]  Mike's too powerful.
[01:48:50.404 --> 01:48:51.504]  I love debate.
[01:48:51.625 --> 01:48:51.965]  I love it.
[01:48:52.025 --> 01:48:53.326]  I love people to disagree with me.
[01:48:53.446 --> 01:48:54.787]  I believe in my intellect and my logic.
[01:48:54.807 --> 01:48:56.949]  No, I'm just saying they want this violence so it's a joke.
[01:48:57.569 --> 01:48:59.090]  But that's my point is that... Obviously, I'm backing down.
[01:48:59.131 --> 01:49:01.793]  That dude... That dude looks like frickin' Mike Tyson.
[01:49:02.954 --> 01:49:05.195]  The point is that we're... Actually, I pissed my pants earlier.
[01:49:05.235 --> 01:49:06.897]  Did you know I actually have urine all over me right now?
[01:49:07.257 --> 01:49:07.557]  Prove it.
[01:49:07.637 --> 01:49:07.957]  Let's see.
[01:49:07.978 --> 01:49:08.338]  Stand up.
[01:49:08.358 --> 01:49:09.679]  No, it's true.
[01:49:09.699 --> 01:49:10.159]  Let's see the britches.
[01:49:10.179 --> 01:49:10.700]  I'm about to show you.
[01:49:10.780 --> 01:49:11.200]  It's embarrassing.
[01:49:11.220 --> 01:49:11.941]  Let's see the britches.
[01:49:13.327 --> 01:49:14.128]  I'm embarrassed right now.
[01:49:14.688 --> 01:49:15.068]  Alright.
[01:49:15.748 --> 01:49:16.068]  Alright.
[01:49:16.088 --> 01:49:18.149]  Keep down.
[01:49:18.430 --> 01:49:20.430]  You urinated, you defecated all over yourself.
[01:49:23.132 --> 01:49:24.252]  You know, I feel sorry for Mike.
[01:49:24.312 --> 01:49:26.133]  I went like that under his nose.
[01:49:26.153 --> 01:49:27.474]  It would just not be very nice.
[01:49:28.834 --> 01:49:29.735]  Nah, but I'm telling you, man.
[01:49:29.755 --> 01:49:31.295]  The worst part is when the nose bone sticks in your hand.
[01:49:31.576 --> 01:49:32.456]  I've had that happen twice.
[01:49:32.496 --> 01:49:33.617]  The nose bone sticks in the hand.
[01:49:34.097 --> 01:49:35.677]  I don't believe that Mike is the enemy.
[01:49:35.737 --> 01:49:37.158]  I don't believe the Boogaloo Boys are the enemy.
[01:49:37.178 --> 01:49:37.979]  I actually love Mike!
[01:49:38.519 --> 01:49:39.359]  Actually, here's the thing.
[01:49:39.399 --> 01:49:40.900]  Me and Mike have been dating for a long time.
[01:49:41.764 --> 01:49:42.925]  And he left me a while back.
[01:49:43.505 --> 01:49:47.067]  We're Southern Poverty Law Center workers, and Morris Dees is our daddy.
[01:49:47.387 --> 01:49:52.389]  He's our leather daddy, and he wears a leather outfit with us in the room, and well, then he has a little bull weppy pops.
[01:49:53.390 --> 01:49:57.312]  All right, we are back live broadcasting worldwide, and I want to be clear.
[01:49:57.332 --> 01:49:59.453]  That's why we got Pete Santilli coming on right now.
[01:49:59.673 --> 01:50:06.957]  I'm not believing Reuters that Enrique Tarrio is a federal informant for drug stuff in Miami, but you know he did get
[01:50:07.873 --> 01:50:10.456]  Set up for selling resale medical equipment.
[01:50:10.476 --> 01:50:10.937]  I looked it up.
[01:50:10.957 --> 01:50:11.758]  That was all BS.
[01:50:12.138 --> 01:50:13.160]  I think Enrique is a good guy.
[01:50:13.180 --> 01:50:14.461]  I've had dinner with him three or four times.
[01:50:14.842 --> 01:50:15.843]  Hung out with him in Austin.
[01:50:16.864 --> 01:50:18.226]  And you know, I like Joe Biggs.
[01:50:18.246 --> 01:50:19.928]  He's been arrested by the FBI on this whole deal.
[01:50:19.988 --> 01:50:20.749]  I know Joe's good.
[01:50:20.769 --> 01:50:21.490]  He wasn't violent.
[01:50:21.971 --> 01:50:23.272]  So I want to be clear when I say
[01:50:24.073 --> 01:50:27.155]  That they had people infiltrating the Proud Boys.
[01:50:27.215 --> 01:50:28.036]  That's because it's a fact.
[01:50:28.536 --> 01:50:31.198]  And we know some people posing as Proud Boys did go into the Capitol.
[01:50:31.498 --> 01:50:33.479]  And I just want people going forward to be aware of this.
[01:50:33.599 --> 01:50:36.741]  As for the Boogaloos, I know that's a very, very diverse group of people.
[01:50:37.322 --> 01:50:41.725]  And I think Mike Dunn, you know, overall tried to really square up and do a major debate with me.
[01:50:41.785 --> 01:50:43.266]  And he was fair to come on the show.
[01:50:44.166 --> 01:50:49.369]  But the larger issues of what he did, saying I'm a Fed and all this other stuff, there's no proof of that.
[01:50:49.389 --> 01:50:49.909]  It's not true.
[01:50:50.750 --> 01:50:57.814]  All I'm saying is, we don't need to invade capitals and give the left the pretext to have a major clampdown on this country.
[01:50:57.834 --> 01:50:58.815]  And that's my common sense.
[01:50:59.115 --> 01:51:00.435]  That's not me afraid of conflict.
[01:51:00.856 --> 01:51:05.018]  That's why I sit there and I confront all these different groups and organizations on the left and the right.
[01:51:05.318 --> 01:51:06.059]  That's what it's all about.
[01:51:06.419 --> 01:51:11.722]  Now we've got a man that became a political prisoner on the line.
[01:51:12.776 --> 01:51:19.724]  Pete Santilli, I used to think he was a fed because he was so out there and you know this and that, putting out kind of that rhetoric.
[01:51:19.744 --> 01:51:31.097]  Later he found out he was being set up and he covered what happened with the Bundy Ranch and then out in Oregon and so much more and he literally didn't plea bargain and beat their fake case against him and he called us, we respect him,
[01:51:32.290 --> 01:51:43.458]  I don't want to make the whole show about what happened on the 6th.
[01:51:43.898 --> 01:51:49.342]  We've got global microchips, forced inoculations, the vaccine killing people, the trial of Trump coming up.
[01:51:49.703 --> 01:51:53.205]  We've got so many big things going on and unfolding here.
[01:51:53.806 --> 01:51:58.209]  I'm just simply saying the left says we're a bunch of violent terrorists that are going to start killing each other.
[01:51:58.769 --> 01:52:04.673]  Let's not play into their hands, because if I was them, and I was a Machiavellian, I would be staging truck bombs and things to blame us.
[01:52:05.114 --> 01:52:08.056]  So I see their next move as a false flag, as I said before, the 6th.
[01:52:08.836 --> 01:52:15.021]  And so that's why I'm so concerned and trying to get people to get out of this violent revolution talk, because this is an information war.
[01:52:15.321 --> 01:52:18.203]  Sure, call me old, call me a wimp, say I'm sitting it out.
[01:52:19.003 --> 01:52:21.725]  You know, Mike Dunn's probably not a Fed.
[01:52:21.805 --> 01:52:26.569]  I've seen, he came on, he had talking points to try to say I was a Fed, but I don't think he's a Fed.
[01:52:27.082 --> 01:52:32.105]  Okay, I just think he's misguided and pissed off and feels like he has a revolutionary duty and caught up with the moment.
[01:52:32.426 --> 01:52:34.967]  Same thing, Proud Boys on average are great, amazing people.
[01:52:35.408 --> 01:52:39.570]  Just because maybe their leader was an informant, well, the feds come after your ass.
[01:52:40.291 --> 01:52:46.455]  So, let's go ahead and go to Pete Santilli and of course, Owen Shorter's riding shotgun here, he can pop in any time, but go ahead.
[01:52:48.991 --> 01:52:50.713]  Alex, thanks for having me back on.
[01:52:50.733 --> 01:52:59.080]  You know, one thing that I learned through the two federal trials that, by the way, I was directly involved in defeating them for the following reasons.
[01:52:59.120 --> 01:53:08.648]  When we talk about the FBI, I mean, if there's anything we get out of this particular segment before I leave, I want everybody to know, and I think you'll agree with me, that one thing we need is
[01:53:09.941 --> 01:53:13.388]  Reform within the FBI with this FBI informant thing.
[01:53:13.648 --> 01:53:16.694]  Yesterday was the fifth anniversary.
[01:53:17.055 --> 01:53:21.083]  January 26th is the day that an FBI informant
[01:53:21.670 --> 01:53:25.613]  Actually set up an ambush with a convoy was the top.
[01:53:25.653 --> 01:53:31.056]  He was the lead security guy and led to the And yes, people do die.
[01:53:31.096 --> 01:53:31.496]  By the way.
[01:53:31.516 --> 01:53:33.178]  I have one of their names.
[01:53:33.238 --> 01:53:45.906]  His name is a little boy Finnegan He was led into that in ambush by an FBI informant a confidential human source what I've learned through the Bundy Ranch trials and the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge is that
[01:53:46.679 --> 01:53:51.003]  Mr. Boogaloo Boy mentioned something when I was doing research on Enrique Theriault.
[01:53:51.444 --> 01:54:07.039]  The number one indication that you've got somebody that is either an FBI informant or potentially to be compromised to become an FBI informant or somebody that cooperates is when they start talking about unlawful activity at no point in time that the president and some
[01:54:07.139 --> 01:54:07.780]  We're good to go.
[01:54:29.162 --> 01:54:30.663]  We patriots don't break the law.
[01:54:30.823 --> 01:54:31.703]  We're defensive.
[01:54:31.903 --> 01:54:39.546]  I mean, even the Citizens Militia that's lawful, compliant, they work with their sheriff, their legislators, they're not talking about breaking the law.
[01:54:39.946 --> 01:54:46.249]  Now, when this gentleman comes on and talks about breaking the law, he's online doing exactly what the FBI wants.
[01:54:46.349 --> 01:54:48.810]  It's basically a freebie for them to grab him.
[01:54:49.370 --> 01:54:53.312]  He should get an attorney, by the way, based on what I heard in his last presentation, because
[01:54:53.812 --> 01:54:55.113]  They're gonna roll this guy.
[01:54:55.333 --> 01:55:07.760]  If he's the leader of the Boogaloo Boys, he's the perfect candidate to say, look it, you're facing 30 years for seditious conspiracy, but if you cooperate, quote-unquote, we will give you time served.
[01:55:08.141 --> 01:55:12.063]  We just need your testimony, and you come into court, and we'll let you go.
[01:55:12.203 --> 01:55:14.024]  And basically, they get 10 other people.
[01:55:14.044 --> 01:55:16.225]  This happened in two separate trials.
[01:55:17.006 --> 01:55:20.588]  We even had a confidential human source, an FBI informant,
[01:55:21.168 --> 01:55:22.488]  His name was Jared Miller.
[01:55:22.528 --> 01:55:24.029]  He worked with the LVMPD.
[01:55:24.089 --> 01:55:29.330]  He was running around at Bunny Ranch asking, he said, I've got a felony and I'm looking for an AK-47.
[01:55:29.850 --> 01:55:31.511]  I said, what the heck is that?
[01:55:31.551 --> 01:55:32.551]  Get the heck away from us.
[01:55:32.871 --> 01:55:33.891]  Go hand out water.
[01:55:34.611 --> 01:55:35.992]  You can't be near a gun.
[01:55:36.012 --> 01:55:36.972]  That's breaking the law.
[01:55:37.012 --> 01:55:38.092]  And Pete, let's be clear.
[01:55:38.212 --> 01:55:41.033]  You were a guy not calling for violence when recovering at the time.
[01:55:41.693 --> 01:55:41.953]  Never.
[01:55:42.113 --> 01:55:45.236]  And you still were in jail for years and they tried to set you up.
[01:55:45.336 --> 01:55:46.557]  You didn't please, you got out.
[01:55:46.577 --> 01:55:47.938]  I mean, this is dangerous.
[01:55:47.978 --> 01:55:50.540]  I'm trying to tell people playing soldier is dangerous.
[01:55:50.560 --> 01:55:52.301]  So I shouldn't kid with people.
[01:55:52.361 --> 01:55:53.482]  I shouldn't get on the level.
[01:55:53.522 --> 01:55:55.804]  He's calling me a fed and call him a young punk and stuff.
[01:55:55.864 --> 01:55:56.625]  I apologize for that.
[01:55:56.945 --> 01:56:01.188]  I'm on against all the Boogaloo people and I'm sure as hell not, not, not some people are texting me.
[01:56:01.388 --> 01:56:02.910]  Hey, are you saying the Proud Boys are feds?
[01:56:02.970 --> 01:56:05.271]  No, it's in Reuters saying that.
[01:56:05.332 --> 01:56:06.773]  And that's why you originally wanted to come on.
[01:56:07.413 --> 01:56:13.278]  We'll do the next segment, but getting to this now, you've seen this before where they come and tell pro and say somebody's a fed when they're not.
[01:56:13.338 --> 01:56:14.940]  Explain that.
[01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:15.360]  That's right.
[01:56:15.440 --> 01:56:16.381]  I'll use an example.
[01:56:16.681 --> 01:56:17.882]  There was a man at Bundy Ranch.
[01:56:17.922 --> 01:56:19.904]  He was in charge of security for Clive and Bundy.
[01:56:19.984 --> 01:56:22.586]  He said it was a former gunnery sergeant in the Marine Corps.
[01:56:22.906 --> 01:56:26.910]  He's running around with guns and teams and he was, you know, talking the talk.
[01:56:27.632 --> 01:56:29.855]  Uh, he was on YouTube obviously doing a lot of research.
[01:56:30.196 --> 01:56:32.599]  That guy had never spent one moment in the Marine Corps.
[01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:34.983]  He was a felon running around with firearms.
[01:56:35.523 --> 01:56:43.034]  Well, when they rounded everybody up, guess who you think, who do you think was the first FBI informant that rolled and the person that cooperated?
[01:56:43.454 --> 01:56:48.316]  The man that was facing 30 years in prison, plus just for being a felon with a firearm.
[01:56:48.656 --> 01:57:05.384]  So when you speak out, even if this kid that was on before the Boogaloo Boy, and I'm not disparaging the Boogaloo Boys, I'm informing the Boogaloo Boys, the number one indicator that you've got a compromising situation is when somebody suggests breaking the law, because we're not lawbreakers.
[01:57:06.225 --> 01:57:07.085]  At Bundy Ranch we
[01:57:07.205 --> 01:57:10.788]  Plus, anybody breaking the law, they never say, we're breaking the law.
[01:57:10.808 --> 01:57:11.889]  They say, hey, we're doing this.
[01:57:12.349 --> 01:57:16.612]  I mean, it doesn't matter where you're at, the military or the mafia or any corporate job.
[01:57:16.913 --> 01:57:19.555]  When people are breaking the law, you don't go, hey, let's break the law.
[01:57:21.107 --> 01:57:35.711]  No, and Alex, here's a list of all the confidential human sources, all of the FBI informants, and we joke about it at Malheur, we say that 8 people took over the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, 15 of them were FBI informants.
[01:57:36.031 --> 01:57:38.892]  They actually acquitted everybody because the people that broke the law
[01:57:39.272 --> 01:57:40.513]  We're the FBI informants.
[01:57:40.553 --> 01:57:42.654]  A Portland jury acquitted the jury.
[01:57:43.034 --> 01:57:47.276]  The FBI informant program needs reform because this is what they do.
[01:57:47.517 --> 01:57:48.897]  They get people that are on drugs.
[01:57:49.278 --> 01:57:50.858]  They give them envelopes of cash.
[01:57:50.878 --> 01:57:56.902]  And this literally happened even with one of our own estranged family members that was on heroin.
[01:57:57.242 --> 01:57:59.223]  They pulled them in, gave them $4,000 in an envelope.
[01:58:01.929 --> 01:58:04.832]  She was hooked on heroin and they had her wired up.
[01:58:04.973 --> 01:58:08.978]  Fortunately, nothing was said on that wire because we're not lawbreakers.
[01:58:09.338 --> 01:58:17.229]  But what they will do is they will also take somebody, I'm going to have to say this, I like Enrique Terrio and I'm not saying that he's a bad guy.
[01:58:17.836 --> 01:58:23.060]  But they arrested him and he faces possible criminal sentencing.
[01:58:23.380 --> 01:58:28.244]  They're going to use somebody like that to say, all right, listen, you're the leader of the Proud Boys.
[01:58:28.364 --> 01:58:33.087]  If you roll on a couple of guys like Joe Biggs, we'll give you a lesser sentence.
[01:58:33.127 --> 01:58:34.088]  We need your testimony.
[01:58:34.328 --> 01:58:41.053]  And they will go out and pursue five to ten people and take them down with Enrique Terrio's testimony.
[01:58:41.353 --> 01:58:43.995]  My main concern is he's already done it before.
[01:58:44.035 --> 01:58:45.076]  I've already checked the record.
[01:58:45.656 --> 01:58:50.881]  He had already been a cooperator in 2012, and Rick Atario was.
[01:58:51.801 --> 01:59:01.049]  And that's my only point, is anybody involved, whether it's Proud Boys or Boogaloo, any paramilitary deal, is going to have feds like flies on piles of you-know-what.
[01:59:01.309 --> 01:59:01.429]  Oh.
[01:59:01.609 --> 01:59:07.073]  And so, and the feds are always leading it, going, oh no, anyone that says look out for feds, they're the enemy.
[01:59:07.373 --> 01:59:08.454]  They're CIA.
[01:59:08.874 --> 01:59:09.934]  Don't listen to Jones.
[01:59:09.974 --> 01:59:11.575]  He's warning you to not get set up.
[01:59:11.876 --> 01:59:12.816]  He's CIA.
[01:59:12.916 --> 01:59:13.096]  No.
[01:59:13.116 --> 01:59:15.778]  If I was CIA, I'd be like, yeah, Trump's gonna win.
[01:59:15.818 --> 01:59:16.679]  Get in there and get him.
[01:59:16.699 --> 01:59:19.260]  All right, I want to come back again on Troyer's take on this.
[01:59:19.280 --> 01:59:22.802]  He'll host a few segments of Leo Zegami coming up on the fall of the Italian government.
[01:59:23.063 --> 01:59:25.584]  I didn't mean to get off into all this today, but it's very important.
[01:59:25.604 --> 01:59:27.125]  So folks, don't get set up.
[01:59:27.185 --> 01:59:28.106]  InfoWards.com.
[01:59:28.868 --> 01:59:37.392]  You know, I think Owen's been right since the first hour, trying to guide me back to not fight with the Boogaloos and not fight with the Proud Boys, which I'm not fighting with any of those groups.
[01:59:37.472 --> 01:59:38.333]  I love the Proud Boys.
[01:59:38.353 --> 01:59:40.393]  I agree with a lot of stuff the Boogaloos say.
[01:59:40.413 --> 01:59:45.016]  I just see a fertile ground for the Feds to set us up.
[01:59:45.396 --> 01:59:45.976]  And you know what?
[01:59:46.056 --> 01:59:46.256]  Fine.
[01:59:46.276 --> 01:59:47.217]  Everybody wants a revolution.
[01:59:47.237 --> 01:59:48.017]  Do whatever you're going to do.
[01:59:48.657 --> 01:59:50.818]  It was all a joke about Mike Dunne and the boxing match.
[01:59:50.959 --> 01:59:53.560]  I saw that stuff with, uh, what's his name?
[01:59:53.740 --> 01:59:54.840]  I've been on the show.
[01:59:57.061 --> 01:59:57.482]  What's it called?
[01:59:57.502 --> 01:59:57.882]  Logan Paul.
[01:59:58.757 --> 02:00:00.358]  Logan Paul and the other Paul guy.
[02:00:00.378 --> 02:00:05.082]  That's like the biggest news in the country because they do the little boxing matches.
[02:00:05.102 --> 02:00:06.563]  It was a joke.
[02:00:08.224 --> 02:00:09.966]  All I know is I'm not working for the CIA.
[02:00:10.266 --> 02:00:12.167]  And I don't think the Dunn guy is working for the FBI.
[02:00:12.227 --> 02:00:16.331]  I kind of thought that before until I actually got the guy on, which even freaks me out more.
[02:00:17.771 --> 02:00:26.654]  And we've got the forced inoculations, the world government, the Davos group, Biden saying you can't say China virus, signing executive orders, you gotta wear two or three masks.
[02:00:26.834 --> 02:00:28.254]  We should have covered all that today.
[02:00:28.654 --> 02:00:31.335]  It's still been a good radio show, but ratings is not what I'm looking for.
[02:00:31.715 --> 02:00:33.295]  That Mike Dunn interview was huge.
[02:00:33.736 --> 02:00:34.616]  It's gonna go viral.
[02:00:35.657 --> 02:00:36.137]  I don't know.
[02:00:53.027 --> 02:00:53.807]  I worked with Trump.
[02:00:53.928 --> 02:00:59.070]  We wanted a peaceful rally to show that we have millions and they have nobody, and that Biden can't fill a parking lot.
[02:00:59.670 --> 02:01:02.852]  And we thought that's what people would do, and a small minority took it over.
[02:01:03.372 --> 02:01:05.413]  But okay, I've taken protest over, so I get it.
[02:01:05.954 --> 02:01:11.817]  So I'm just pissed because my mission and my operation got screwed, and I see it as a defeat.
[02:01:12.777 --> 02:01:14.058]  Other people see it as a victory.
[02:01:14.238 --> 02:01:15.259]  I don't see it as a victory.
[02:01:15.279 --> 02:01:18.540]  I want to go back to Owen Schwartz for some comments, then we'll get Pete Santelli's take.
[02:01:19.201 --> 02:01:20.861]  Well, I think in general, Alex, there were just...
[02:01:22.879 --> 02:01:26.881]  Unmeasurables and things that happened that were just out of our control that we didn't expect.
[02:01:26.941 --> 02:01:33.445]  I mean, Trump had, I mean, I've never seen a crowd that big for a speech at the Washington Monument and then inside the crowd.
[02:01:33.465 --> 02:01:36.867]  That was Trump's, that was a bigger, bigger crowd than he had his inauguration four years ago.
[02:01:37.187 --> 02:01:40.309]  And so, you know, it's like, wow, look at all these millions of people here.
[02:01:41.089 --> 02:01:45.372]  And we didn't even know at the time, because like you said, I mean, we were having a debate right there.
[02:01:45.392 --> 02:01:48.494]  I mean, that's the thing, look, trust me folks, there's no controlled opposition here.
[02:01:48.534 --> 02:01:49.855]  We're flying from the seat of our pants.
[02:01:49.875 --> 02:01:53.297]  We had a debate, Alex, you and me, the crew, we debated right there on the streets.
[02:01:53.457 --> 02:01:54.218]  When should we march?
[02:01:54.278 --> 02:01:54.938]  How should we march?
[02:01:54.998 --> 02:01:55.859]  What should our message be?
[02:01:56.219 --> 02:01:57.120]  Okay, peaceful march.
[02:01:57.140 --> 02:01:57.900]  Alright, when should we do it?
[02:01:57.920 --> 02:02:01.282]  We're having debates during the break about, hey, Boogaloo's are probably good, leave them alone.
[02:02:01.742 --> 02:02:03.063]  Or, you know, don't be mean to the Proud Boys.
[02:02:03.083 --> 02:02:04.384]  I'm not even being mean to the Proud Boys.
[02:02:04.664 --> 02:02:06.405]  It's in the news, they're saying he's a federal informant.
[02:02:06.425 --> 02:02:07.126]  I don't know if that's true.
[02:02:07.426 --> 02:02:14.170]  And so my point is that we didn't realize there were going to be 100,000 people at the Capitol before we were even leaving the Trump speech.
[02:02:14.470 --> 02:02:20.754]  We didn't realize people were going to be charged up and wanting to breach the Capitol while we were sitting there listening to Trump speak.
[02:02:21.035 --> 02:02:26.398]  Had we that foresight, which maybe that's our regret that we didn't, had we that foresight, we would have been more clear.
[02:02:26.438 --> 02:02:28.179]  Hey, make sure no one breaches the ground.
[02:02:28.259 --> 02:02:29.480]  Make sure they have their hearing.
[02:02:29.560 --> 02:02:32.822]  Make sure Trump gets there so we can have a peaceful rally.
[02:02:33.002 --> 02:02:33.682]  Well, exactly.
[02:02:33.743 --> 02:02:35.704]  But let me just say this before we go back to Pete Santilli.
[02:02:36.164 --> 02:02:38.626]  Who's been a political prisoner and been proven to be a political prisoner.
[02:02:39.006 --> 02:02:41.968]  Quite the four-leaf clover to actually make it out of it.
[02:02:41.988 --> 02:02:42.909]  Almost no one else does.
[02:02:43.749 --> 02:02:44.770]  Let's expand on this.
[02:02:46.531 --> 02:02:54.077]  If people went into Microsoft, that is a eugenics globalist organization, pushing world government, pushing forced inoculations that are killing people.
[02:02:55.316 --> 02:02:56.958]  I would say, okay, it's a revolution.
[02:02:57.018 --> 02:03:04.786]  And I'm not saying do that, but if people raided the CFR in New York, if people raided the Davos Group, if people, I would say, whoa, they're attacking the real enemy.
[02:03:05.407 --> 02:03:10.953]  The People's House and the Congress, when we're about to win, I'm just saying that's not the right target.
[02:03:11.253 --> 02:03:13.455]  That's all I'm saying is it was an idiotic target.
[02:03:14.296 --> 02:03:15.977]  And that's why I get pissed off.
[02:03:16.157 --> 02:03:28.484]  Well, that's what happens when you don't have, and again, I've never been a violent revolutionary, never will be, but that's what happens when you think you're going to have a violent revolution, or you think you're going to spark a violent revolution, or maybe you have that in the back of your mind, and you don't actually... Well, let's be clear, let's be clear.
[02:03:28.724 --> 02:03:34.807]  The Q thing created this, the main group that went in behind the Antifa was Q people.
[02:03:34.847 --> 02:03:38.929]  Not against the average Q person, but they believed this was, oh Q, we're winning!
[02:03:39.429 --> 02:03:40.170]  This was the real...
[02:03:41.110 --> 02:03:47.416]  If you want to make the comparison to 1776, which I'm in agreement with you, that's about the ideology, not about the physical violence.
[02:03:47.776 --> 02:03:48.557]  They didn't just show up.
[02:03:48.577 --> 02:03:50.419]  I mean, they planned the Boston Tea Party.
[02:03:50.459 --> 02:03:53.362]  They planned hiding in the woods when the Redcoats marched through.
[02:03:53.402 --> 02:03:55.423]  They specifically attacked the ships.
[02:03:56.411 --> 02:03:58.431]  That we're paying the tax and made them pay.
[02:03:58.491 --> 02:04:00.352]  That was a very precise attack.
[02:04:00.832 --> 02:04:03.672]  And I'll just say this as far as Enrique is concerned.
[02:04:03.692 --> 02:04:07.133]  You know, I consider Enrique a pretty close friend.
[02:04:07.153 --> 02:04:11.434]  I know some things about his past and I would be shocked.
[02:04:11.614 --> 02:04:18.995]  I would be shocked and stunned if Enrique would capitulate to the FBI or become some sort of informer against his boys.
[02:04:19.355 --> 02:04:20.975]  I don't want to say too much private stuff.
[02:04:21.015 --> 02:04:22.695]  I mean, maybe he'll go on record, but I'll tell you.
[02:04:22.715 --> 02:04:25.476]  Well, what they're saying is years ago he was an informant.
[02:04:26.363 --> 02:04:53.792]  When he was selling like medical supplies for testing for diabetes and I know that works if you don't you're not an official company you're not allowed to resell I looked up his stuff he went to jail for that so like that's nothing and so it's like oh past stuff like five ten years ago and we've got who knows if it's true because you're right the FBI could put anything in those reports well and I'll just say this again I don't want to say too much he'll make his own statements but I'll just say back then they did try to cut deals with him to get him less jail time and he he didn't take him he passed him he did his full sentence so
[02:04:55.384 --> 02:04:55.805]  That's right.
[02:04:56.125 --> 02:04:57.588]  So we don't believe anything the mainstream media says.
[02:04:57.628 --> 02:05:08.688]  Going back to Pete Santilli, who was a political prisoner back in the Bundy Ranch days, what other comments do you want to relay to people about the season we're going into of false flags, of violence, of insanity?
[02:05:10.444 --> 02:05:19.168]  Listen, of course, rank-and-file FBI, law enforcement, they're probably not involved in non-compromise, but at the upper echelon, and I have first-hand experience.
[02:05:19.588 --> 02:05:22.510]  Lundy Ranch was not a spontaneous event in April of 2014.
[02:05:22.570 --> 02:05:28.872]  They started creating the emotional pretext for an indictment in January of 2014.
[02:05:31.113 --> 02:05:32.854]  Now, do you remember Larry Grathwald?
[02:05:33.014 --> 02:05:34.795]  Larry Grathwald was an FBI informant.
[02:05:34.835 --> 02:05:36.696]  He was not an agent way back in the day.
[02:05:36.936 --> 02:05:39.177]  He infiltrated the weather underground.
[02:05:39.577 --> 02:05:45.439]  I think all of us here, and hopefully all of your listenership, law-abiding citizens, we want to go get the bad guys.
[02:05:45.819 --> 02:05:47.660]  Larry Grathwald was the perfect
[02:05:48.406 --> 02:05:51.048]  Uh, FBI informant, because he pursued the bad guys.
[02:05:51.348 --> 02:06:00.855]  If Enrique Terrio shared information about lawbreakers, I don't know the Proud Boys, I don't know any Proud Boys that want to break the law, uh, nor does Enrique Terrio, I'm sure.
[02:06:00.875 --> 02:06:01.756]  Well, let's expand on that.
[02:06:01.856 --> 02:06:03.657]  Now the Weathermen are in control of the government.
[02:06:04.057 --> 02:06:09.781]  Grathwald and Greenberet of Patriot, they recruited him at Columbia, and he went in and it was like horrible.
[02:06:10.081 --> 02:06:11.622]  He did the right thing and went to the FBI.
[02:06:11.662 --> 02:06:12.143]  That's good.
[02:06:13.210 --> 02:06:13.791]  Exactly right.
[02:06:14.572 --> 02:06:24.322]  Now, there's a lot of pressure on people and that's where I say you make the perfect FBI informant when they force 30 years upon you and say, well, if you'll cooperate.
[02:06:24.622 --> 02:06:31.109]  Well, if you're of the integrity, I'm glad, and I didn't know this, I'm glad that Owen mentioned it, that he did not capitulate.
[02:06:31.269 --> 02:06:33.671]  I was asked, would you like to cooperate?
[02:06:33.692 --> 02:06:33.912]  I said,
[02:06:34.492 --> 02:06:35.792]  I have nothing to cooperate about.
[02:06:35.832 --> 02:06:39.613]  I saw nobody breaking the law and I told the prosecutors to pound sand.
[02:06:40.233 --> 02:06:45.035]  And that is, a person of integrity is going to stand on the truth, of course.
[02:06:45.295 --> 02:06:49.716]  Now, there are individuals that will succumb to the pressure, unfortunately.
[02:06:49.736 --> 02:06:54.217]  And we have to vet the people that are around us, but like I said, the number one indication
[02:06:54.857 --> 02:07:04.167]  That you're around somebody that is either an informant that is setting you up for entrapment because that's what they did through Bundy Ranch and the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge.
[02:07:04.428 --> 02:07:06.029]  You will be entrapped by these people.
[02:07:06.330 --> 02:07:11.916]  The FBI uses those less than scrupulous people that are, you know,
[02:07:12.276 --> 02:07:12.637]  Absolutely.
[02:07:12.897 --> 02:07:15.622]  Alright, Pete Santilli, I appreciate your time.
[02:07:15.662 --> 02:07:16.523]  How do people find your show?
[02:07:26.141 --> 02:07:29.083]  All of our links are at PeteSantilli.mobi.
[02:07:29.123 --> 02:07:32.225]  We're all over the place, well diversified, so that people can find us.
[02:07:32.245 --> 02:07:38.970]  We're being chased around the internet just like everyone else is, being demonetized and deleted, but PeteSantilli.mobi.
[02:07:38.990 --> 02:07:40.211]  All right, we'll talk to you again soon.
[02:07:40.231 --> 02:07:40.871]  We're out of time.
[02:07:40.931 --> 02:07:41.452]  Thank you, brother.
[02:07:41.712 --> 02:07:42.172]  Thanks for having me on.
[02:07:42.192 --> 02:07:44.354]  And again, I didn't want to spend... Thank you, sir.
[02:07:44.374 --> 02:07:53.040]  I didn't want to spend two hours of the show, which we basically just did, on this, but I was there, I witnessed it, and I witnessed people being led into idiocy.
[02:07:53.940 --> 02:07:56.603]  And I just do not want to see this happen anymore.
[02:07:57.003 --> 02:07:59.005]  I want to politically challenge Joe Biden.
[02:07:59.586 --> 02:08:02.348]  Joe Biden's going to fail if we just politically challenge him.
[02:08:02.609 --> 02:08:08.775]  If we just have the states organize a new Declaration of Independence, if we just say you're a fraud, if we're peaceful, we're going to beat him.
[02:08:08.815 --> 02:08:09.595]  We have the people.
[02:08:09.655 --> 02:08:10.736]  Trump won the landslide.
[02:08:11.037 --> 02:08:12.859]  They want to trick us into a violent revolution.
[02:08:13.159 --> 02:08:14.961]  If you think I'm wrong, don't listen, folks.
[02:08:15.001 --> 02:08:15.461]  That's fine.
[02:08:16.322 --> 02:08:17.923]  I don't think violent revolution is the answer.
[02:08:17.983 --> 02:08:18.264]  And listen,
[02:08:19.650 --> 02:08:21.971]  You know, you heard the boogaloo go, oh, you're bad, you sell things.
[02:08:21.991 --> 02:08:25.813]  Well, yeah, I've got a network, satellite up, Lynx TV, huge crew that's all paid well.
[02:08:26.113 --> 02:08:26.893]  We're trying to stay on air.
[02:08:27.174 --> 02:08:29.095]  Please go to infowarestore.com today.
[02:08:29.595 --> 02:08:31.616]  We have the Liquid Turmeric Extract.
[02:08:31.716 --> 02:08:35.938]  It's so good for your immune system, so good for inflammation, so good for everything.
[02:08:36.398 --> 02:08:37.218]  It's about to sell out.
[02:08:37.238 --> 02:08:40.180]  Despite that, it's still discounted.
[02:08:40.640 --> 02:08:46.543]  And X2, the Deep Earth Crystal, pure iodine, essential to your body, the building block of everything.
[02:08:48.083 --> 02:08:55.548]  That sale of 50% off will end in about three days, because we're very close to selling out of X2 and in fullwarestore.com.
[02:08:55.588 --> 02:08:56.589]  And without you, we're not here.
[02:08:57.330 --> 02:08:59.251]  You know me, I'm not trying to win a popularity contest.
[02:08:59.291 --> 02:09:00.372]  I'm trying to beat the globalists.
[02:09:00.932 --> 02:09:05.996]  And so my job is to do what's unpopular and tell the truth up front and not play games with this garbage.
[02:09:06.516 --> 02:09:07.337]  And that's my commitment.
[02:09:07.417 --> 02:09:08.358]  I'm not thinking about myself.
[02:09:08.398 --> 02:09:12.721]  I'm thinking about what happens to me at the end of the day, though I ask you to pray for us and keep us in the fight.
[02:09:13.081 --> 02:09:15.122]  So Owen Troyer, I know we pushed Zogami off.
[02:09:15.182 --> 02:09:15.743]  I want to hear from him.
[02:09:15.763 --> 02:09:16.703]  I don't know if he's coming up.
[02:09:17.123 --> 02:09:20.045]  And then we've got John Rappaport loaded for bear.
[02:09:20.405 --> 02:09:21.146]  You take over.
[02:09:21.206 --> 02:09:22.746]  Hopefully Zogami's coming on for a few segments.
[02:09:22.806 --> 02:09:23.567]  If not, I don't know.
[02:09:23.967 --> 02:09:27.629]  And then we've got John Rappaport coming up in the War Room that Owen will be hosting.
[02:09:28.009 --> 02:09:29.570]  I'm sure he's wound up listening to me for hours.
[02:09:30.251 --> 02:09:30.611]  3 p.m.
[02:09:30.671 --> 02:09:31.451]  Central today.
[02:09:31.491 --> 02:09:32.592]  Be sure and spread those links.
[02:09:32.972 --> 02:09:33.712]  We'll be right back.
[02:09:33.733 --> 02:09:34.353]  Please stay with us.
[02:09:35.316 --> 02:09:37.838]  We're back here in the InfoWars World Headquarters in Austin, Texas.
[02:09:37.878 --> 02:09:42.263]  Owen Schroer and Leo Zagami with you for about the next 20 minutes.
[02:09:43.164 --> 02:09:45.946]  I'm seeing all kinds of headlines out of Italy.
[02:09:46.126 --> 02:09:47.768]  The government collapsing.
[02:09:49.089 --> 02:09:50.591]  Government officials stepping down.
[02:09:50.971 --> 02:09:58.076]  There seems to be some sort of a, maybe not the best phrase, but like a cold civil war, a war of words for sure happening.
[02:09:58.556 --> 02:10:10.425]  And so I always think of Leo Zagami from Italy, did a lot of great work exposing the Vatican, his great books, we sell them at Infowarsstore.com, and of course the greatest Italian-American accent in radio.
[02:10:10.465 --> 02:10:12.466]  So, Leo Zagami joins me now.
[02:10:13.146 --> 02:10:16.549]  Leo, what is going on in Italy right now?
[02:10:17.009 --> 02:10:18.090]  Explain this to the audience.
[02:10:19.246 --> 02:10:23.388]  Well, it's very hard to explain something that even the Italians seem to have problems in explaining.
[02:10:23.448 --> 02:10:41.417]  I mean, I just saw the latest news and they're giving like five different kind of solutions to the problem, which is basically a crisis that was created by a friend of Joe Biden, Matteo Renzi, who with the arrival of Joe Biden in the White House,
[02:10:42.217 --> 02:10:58.404]  He obviously tried to create a crisis so he can get back in government in a leading position because his group, his political party, which only counts 3% of the national votes, is actually a non-existing party almost.
[02:10:58.584 --> 02:11:03.467]  But he's very influential because he's linked to both Barack Obama and Joe Biden.
[02:11:03.487 --> 02:11:05.948]  So Mattiorenzi has instigated this crisis.
[02:11:06.528 --> 02:11:06.688]  I think?
[02:11:26.310 --> 02:11:45.558]  A new government, but we don't know if now in the last couple of hours is going to be a new government with Giuseppe Conte because they want to get him out of the way after he received the famous endorsement by Donald J. Trump, President Donald Trump, who endorsed Giuseppe Conte.
[02:11:46.578 --> 02:11:50.340]  And this is a war that, of course, of words, like you said,
[02:11:50.820 --> 02:11:57.044]  But there is a growing tension in Italy because people are pretty desperate.
[02:11:57.084 --> 02:11:58.946]  The lockdowns are never ending.
[02:11:58.966 --> 02:12:04.609]  And so this political charade is not really appreciated by anybody.
[02:12:05.070 --> 02:12:15.917]  And the fear that all these parties have is to actually go to the elections, because with the elections, the center right will definitely win with a large majority.
[02:12:16.457 --> 02:12:25.580]  And at that point, though, the European Union will force them out of government in one way or another because they don't want the center right.
[02:12:25.620 --> 02:12:35.203]  They want a pro-European force in charge of Italy now that the actual mess, this financial
[02:12:36.023 --> 02:12:36.463]  It's all
[02:13:00.796 --> 02:13:01.136]  I think.
[02:13:23.849 --> 02:13:52.791]  For a center-right coalition to be in charge and then last year suddenly there was Matteo Salvini that was sent away and then they substituted his political party with the party that actually was the opposition, the Democrat Party in Italy, which is of course conducted behind the scenes by people who are very close to both Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi.
[02:13:52.811 --> 02:13:53.492]  Nancy Pelosi who
[02:13:53.712 --> 02:13:54.012]  Yes, she is.
[02:13:54.032 --> 02:13:55.814]  She regularly goes to Italy.
[02:13:56.074 --> 02:13:57.335]  She's Italian American.
[02:13:57.435 --> 02:14:02.080]  And she is, of course, also very close to the Italian mob.
[02:14:02.700 --> 02:14:09.807]  And it seems like in the end, the guy who is in charge of it all is the Italian president, who I really dislike.
[02:14:09.827 --> 02:14:10.748]  He's Sicilian.
[02:14:11.148 --> 02:14:12.329]  I'm half Sicilian myself.
[02:14:12.770 --> 02:14:15.272]  But he is actually the son of a mobster.
[02:14:15.692 --> 02:14:16.712]  A real mobster.
[02:14:16.752 --> 02:14:21.794]  So the President of Italy is basically creating this new option.
[02:14:21.834 --> 02:14:23.015]  Alright, we'll come back Leo.
[02:14:23.055 --> 02:14:24.095]  We're taking a break here.
[02:14:24.975 --> 02:14:28.957]  But the point is, populist uprisings are happening all over the world and the globalists hate it.
[02:14:30.297 --> 02:14:32.958]  Final segment that I'm here, I have Leo Zagami with me.
[02:14:32.978 --> 02:14:34.659]  John Rappaport gonna take over.
[02:14:36.091 --> 02:14:37.652]  After this segment.
[02:14:38.373 --> 02:14:41.735]  You know, Leo Zagami with us here, leozagami.com.
[02:14:42.475 --> 02:14:57.765]  I think that the general notion here is, and you're trying to get into some of the details, but it's very confusing, I think, for the whole world watching what's happening right now, including maybe for some people what they're seeing in America is probably confusing, unless you really understand all the details.
[02:14:58.345 --> 02:15:03.469]  But, as a general statement, or a general kind of analysis here,
[02:15:04.289 --> 02:15:17.732]  You know, this is just another country like the United States or Brazil, Italy, Poland that's having nationalistic populist uprisings against what they now see as a threat to their nation-state sovereignty.
[02:15:18.173 --> 02:15:26.955]  So whether that's the UN, whether that's the EU, whether that's the medical tyranny that we're seeing now with the fake pandemic COVID that's gone worldwide,
[02:15:27.595 --> 02:15:45.633]  Uh, you know, that's what they're trying to stop from happening, and so they demonize the people like Trump, they demonize the people like Conte, uh, and so that's the problem here, is that you have the nationalistic uprising of people who are now aware of the New World Order, they don't want the UN, they don't want the EU, they vote themselves out of it.
[02:15:46.354 --> 02:15:47.255]  Kind of like at Brexit.
[02:15:47.855 --> 02:15:50.096]  And then the establishment just says, no, you don't get that.
[02:15:50.476 --> 02:15:51.537]  You don't get to have Brexit.
[02:15:51.557 --> 02:15:52.558]  You don't get to have Trump.
[02:15:52.898 --> 02:15:56.260]  You don't get to have a resurgence of nationalism in Italy.
[02:15:56.780 --> 02:15:59.722]  And so it's just this, it's just kind of this push and this tug.
[02:16:00.022 --> 02:16:04.424]  You know, the old saying, an unstoppable force meets an immovable object.
[02:16:04.484 --> 02:16:06.425]  I mean, you know, that's the battle that we're seeing here.
[02:16:07.771 --> 02:16:12.615]  What are the Italian people saying and thinking about this, I guess, aside from the confusion?
[02:16:12.635 --> 02:16:17.459]  I mean, because there is no doubt, I mean, Trump is massively popular, the most popular U.S.
[02:16:17.499 --> 02:16:18.860]  president in modern day history.
[02:16:19.320 --> 02:16:21.962]  I think he got 75 million votes minimum.
[02:16:22.343 --> 02:16:27.887]  I mean, I'd even make the argument more than that with what we've seen with some of the machines flipping votes to Biden.
[02:16:28.367 --> 02:16:31.830]  I think Trump maybe got 80 million plus votes, but we know at least 75 plus million.
[02:16:33.251 --> 02:16:42.263]  What are the people in Italy saying about this, you know, the nationalistic, populistic uprising which is just common sense, nation-state sovereignty versus a global agenda?
[02:16:43.044 --> 02:16:47.871]  What are the people saying outside of the words that's happening inside the collapsing government?
[02:16:48.891 --> 02:16:57.714]  Well, they are upset because you see Giuseppe Conte arrived into power thanks to the Five Star Movement, which was perceived as populist.
[02:16:57.754 --> 02:17:08.958]  But after they kicked out Matteo Salvini, and then at that point they placed this insane coalition with the Democratic Party, which was center-left.
[02:17:09.838 --> 02:17:19.183]  The people are really disappointed with the Five Star Movement and they of course see as a last beacon of hope the league of Matteo Salvini.
[02:17:19.483 --> 02:17:35.491]  But they are very worried because they want to place as a new Prime Minister Mario Draghi, who worked for Goldman Sachs, who was the head of the European Central Bank and who is the choice of the Illuminati, the Academy of the Illuminati in Rome.
[02:17:35.851 --> 02:17:40.672]  He has always pushed for Mario Draghi as Prime Minister.
[02:17:41.372 --> 02:17:55.376]  So he's a Jesuit creature and probably ultimately he's going to go and substitute Giuseppe Conte if he's not capable of putting together now the third coalition possibility.
[02:17:55.676 --> 02:18:00.297]  He's trying to, but I think it's going to be very difficult for him.
[02:18:00.797 --> 02:18:07.702]  Because there is this Matteo Renzi guy who of course wants to become foreign minister now that his friend Joe Biden is in the White House.
[02:18:07.722 --> 02:18:18.329]  So these people are all part of the same global insanity, global new world order led by China.
[02:18:18.729 --> 02:18:28.731]  That is, of course, destroying sovereignty and it's destroying populism because they perceive it as a very dangerous ideology.
[02:18:28.811 --> 02:18:30.951]  At the same time, we have, of course, the Vatican.
[02:18:31.271 --> 02:18:44.854]  The Vatican and the Pope, who has become more and more a political figure, criticizing any form of uprise, criticizing, of course, people who refuse the vaccine.
[02:18:45.214 --> 02:18:46.194]  And he himself,
[02:18:46.434 --> 02:18:47.395]  I think?
[02:19:09.156 --> 02:19:18.000]  And there is a lot of worries in the Vatican because they didn't want the Pope to resign with Ratzinger still alive.
[02:19:18.700 --> 02:19:23.162]  Of course, it becomes then a political matter to elect the next Pope.
[02:19:23.583 --> 02:19:37.209]  But we know that Pope Francis has already nominated the right amount of cardinals to take over the next election and place another progressive Pope.
[02:19:37.649 --> 02:19:40.011]  Because that's what they want to do.
[02:19:40.351 --> 02:19:42.952]  And Davos, you mentioned Davos in your show.
[02:19:42.992 --> 02:19:59.602]  Of course, the Vatican also has given their support to the Great Reset, and it's more and more into this whole thing of destroying capitalism and substituting it with communism.
[02:19:59.642 --> 02:20:00.243]  At the same time,
[02:20:00.703 --> 02:20:07.530]  There is more and more heresies in the church that are not only tolerated but even promoted.
[02:20:08.451 --> 02:20:09.953]  We have had also an attack.
[02:20:10.612 --> 02:20:31.898]  On a church here, a Catholic church here in the United States a few days ago by Antifa during a pro-life mass that was conducted I think by an Archbishop and it was in Ohio and they stormed the church and there were children present and they were shouting profanities and then we have also the Catholic
[02:20:32.718 --> 02:20:33.299]  I think?
[02:20:51.488 --> 02:20:51.929]  Yeah.
[02:21:06.881 --> 02:21:17.204]  Jesus has suffered just like us and that if Jesus was here today, he would be protecting and working mainly for the LGBTQ community.
[02:21:17.324 --> 02:21:22.006]  I know that this sounds insane, but in this film, there is actually a Jesuit
[02:21:22.606 --> 02:21:22.946]  Yeah.
[02:21:52.386 --> 02:21:54.507]  Yeah, and that's just a form of intimidation.
[02:21:54.627 --> 02:21:59.490]  It's like, oh, you know, be pro-LGBTQ or, you know, your church may get burned to the ground.
[02:21:59.930 --> 02:22:04.212]  And, you know, it's a weird thing because, I mean, I was raised Catholic.
[02:22:04.272 --> 02:22:05.193]  I grew up Catholic.
[02:22:05.573 --> 02:22:07.354]  Catholics really used to look up to the Pope.
[02:22:07.394 --> 02:22:10.135]  I mean, Pope John Paul II was a hero in the Catholic community.
[02:22:10.496 --> 02:22:13.057]  Now, like, the Pope isn't even influential on Catholics.
[02:22:13.177 --> 02:22:15.338]  Like, they've just, I mean, it's like it doesn't even exist.
[02:22:15.538 --> 02:22:17.559]  Nobody looks to the Vatican for leadership anymore.
[02:22:17.959 --> 02:22:19.460]  So the Catholic Church is kind of lost in a way.
[02:22:21.121 --> 02:22:30.209]  But Leo, by the way, you've made the prediction that they're going to announce, probably before the end of the year, that that African cardinal is going to be the next pope.
[02:22:30.490 --> 02:22:33.252]  But in the last 90 seconds here, Leo, make a prediction.
[02:22:33.913 --> 02:22:36.195]  What do you think happens with the current situation?
[02:22:36.215 --> 02:22:38.617]  What's the conclusion of the current situation of the Italian government?
[02:22:40.416 --> 02:22:43.459]  The Italian situation is simply a charade.
[02:22:43.879 --> 02:22:49.464]  In a way, you know, we see different kinds of charades being taking place here in the U.S.
[02:22:50.025 --> 02:22:54.428]  You, unfortunately, have seen what has happened in Washington, D.C.
[02:22:54.468 --> 02:23:07.120]  In Italy, they haven't managed to riot or rebel in the same way, but they, of course, are taking away the interest of people from the main subject, which is being locked down in
[02:23:07.640 --> 02:23:07.740]  Yes.
[02:23:33.135 --> 02:23:43.464]  Bars and restaurants out of 10 in northern Italy, and this is an official news that is being reported yesterday, will go bankrupt.
[02:23:43.904 --> 02:23:51.490]  So that means that the Italian economy is really on the verge of some very big problems.
[02:23:51.931 --> 02:23:55.754]  And the people are getting more and more upset.
[02:23:55.774 --> 02:23:57.255]  So how are you going to control these people?
[02:23:57.275 --> 02:23:59.357]  Well, they simply silence them with censorship.
[02:24:00.402 --> 02:24:02.303]  LeoZagami.com.
[02:24:02.343 --> 02:24:04.304]  Leo, thank you for joining us today.
[02:24:04.364 --> 02:24:05.984]  I'm sure we'll be hearing from you again soon.
[02:24:06.744 --> 02:24:08.665]  People are fighting back against the New World Order, folks.
[02:24:09.666 --> 02:24:10.566]  Here we are, folks.
[02:24:11.626 --> 02:24:14.747]  Good to be with you again here at InfoWars, John Rappaport.
[02:24:16.068 --> 02:24:27.492]  Leading with a story today, which is the tip of the iceberg, a video from a man who states that he is a nurse's assistant at a nursing home.
[02:24:27.532 --> 02:24:29.593]  He's obviously been working there for a while.
[02:24:30.919 --> 02:24:40.286]  And he is making the claim that many people are dropping like flies in the nursing home after they're being injected with a COVID vaccine.
[02:24:41.427 --> 02:24:47.993]  He is saying that some of his patients, people that he has been caring for, have been dying.
[02:24:48.933 --> 02:24:53.937]  Others who were walking are now not able to walk.
[02:24:55.238 --> 02:24:57.360]  Some are now no longer able to talk.
[02:25:01.593 --> 02:25:14.141]  So, I would ordinarily say, okay, so let's exercise extreme caution here because we can't verify that this account is absolutely true.
[02:25:15.162 --> 02:25:22.727]  But there is common sense data to back it up, which I have been supplying for months and months and months now.
[02:25:24.128 --> 02:25:25.369]  And that is the following.
[02:25:28.711 --> 02:25:29.592]  In the major
[02:25:30.228 --> 02:25:32.250]  Clinical trials of the vaccine.
[02:25:33.991 --> 02:25:42.578]  It's pretty obvious that the elderly and frail were not accepted as volunteers in the clinical trials.
[02:25:43.859 --> 02:25:55.508]  Therefore, there was no way to tell what the effects of the experimental vaccine were on these people, who are the people who are living in nursing homes.
[02:25:56.095 --> 02:26:01.836]  Who are now being pushed close to the front of the line to receive the COVID vaccine.
[02:26:03.696 --> 02:26:22.240]  Now, if people who are ordinarily fairly healthy, who are receiving the vaccine, are reporting adverse events, and we're seeing this breaking out all over the world, unable to perform daily duties, can't go to work,
[02:26:23.621 --> 02:26:26.923]  And then presumably, supposedly, they recover.
[02:26:27.763 --> 02:26:31.685]  And these are people who are either very healthy or fairly healthy.
[02:26:32.426 --> 02:26:50.596]  Then what do you expect is going to be the effect of this vaccine on people who start out being frail, elderly, suffering from multiple health conditions for many years, have been treated for many years with toxic medication?
[02:26:52.341 --> 02:26:54.822]  What do you think is going to happen to this?
[02:26:58.084 --> 02:27:10.769]  It's obvious from a common sense point of view that many of them are going to become even more seriously ill and many of them are going to die.
[02:27:10.789 --> 02:27:17.832]  We're talking about the forced early premature death of these people.
[02:27:18.633 --> 02:27:21.274]  The killing of these people via the vaccine.
[02:27:22.006 --> 02:27:22.446]  Murder.
[02:27:23.106 --> 02:27:24.967]  That's what we're talking about.
[02:27:28.347 --> 02:27:46.310]  I expect this story to be gaining significant amount of force very quickly in the upcoming days and weeks as reports leak out from nursing homes about what is happening to the frail and elderly who are getting the vaccine.
[02:27:47.531 --> 02:27:49.291]  Again, just use your common sense.
[02:27:51.383 --> 02:28:11.058]  What do you think is going to happen to these people who were excluded from the clinical trials of the vaccine for obvious reasons that the pharmaceutical companies did not want to have these people folding up and dying when they get the vaccine during the clinical trials.
[02:28:11.959 --> 02:28:13.280]  So they were excluded.
[02:28:14.461 --> 02:28:16.363]  Well, they're not excluded now.
[02:28:17.443 --> 02:28:19.265]  This is not a clinical trial.
[02:28:20.151 --> 02:28:33.513]  This is a vast guinea pig experiment on a global basis using a technology that has never been brought to market before called RNA technology.
[02:28:34.813 --> 02:28:39.354]  It's been tried and it's failed to come to market.
[02:28:39.374 --> 02:28:39.434]  Why?
[02:28:40.134 --> 02:28:46.756]  Because of the adverse effects on the people that it's been experimented with.
[02:28:47.796 --> 02:28:49.396]  Talking mainly about
[02:28:51.736 --> 02:28:55.637]  Serious autoimmune reactions.
[02:28:56.518 --> 02:28:59.459]  The body basically attacks itself.
[02:29:04.700 --> 02:29:14.804]  If you have people who are in these nursing homes, be aware of this information.
[02:29:16.784 --> 02:29:18.245]  I can't overstress it.
[02:29:21.624 --> 02:29:33.490]  Now, on a somewhat related note, I want to point to the shocking research of a woman from Canada named Christine Massey.
[02:29:34.991 --> 02:29:47.857]  She and her colleagues, for many months now, have been sending Freedom of Information Act requests to public health agencies in Canada and in other parts of the world.
[02:29:49.378 --> 02:29:51.159]  Very specific requests.
[02:29:52.771 --> 02:30:08.300]  To provide records that prove and show that the coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has ever really been isolated from a diseased patient.
[02:30:12.362 --> 02:30:19.546]  And in these FOIA requests, the conditions are very clearly spelled out.
[02:30:20.947 --> 02:30:22.328]  We're talking about
[02:30:25.148 --> 02:30:40.371]  The SARS-CoV-2 virus being separated out from any surrounding material, any other viruses, bacteria, cellular material, genetic debris, etc., etc.
[02:30:42.451 --> 02:30:54.394]  Requesting that these public health agencies come through and provide records that show that this purported virus, SARS-CoV-2,
[02:30:55.433 --> 02:31:04.638]  Which is said to be the cause of a worldwide pandemic has ever really truly been isolated from a patient.
[02:31:06.339 --> 02:31:11.182]  Translation, has it ever really been proved to exist?
[02:31:14.824 --> 02:31:22.508]  So as I recently reported at No More Fake News, what Christine Massey and her colleagues have discovered
[02:31:24.835 --> 02:31:47.763]  In 46 separate cases where they submitted these FOIA requests to public health agencies in Canada and other parts of the world, the number of records that were returned to them supposedly proving that this virus has ever been isolated is zero.
[02:31:48.863 --> 02:31:53.685]  Zero, zero, zero records have been produced
[02:31:54.494 --> 02:31:57.377]  In 46 separate instances.
[02:31:58.638 --> 02:32:00.960]  Typical reply goes something like this.
[02:32:01.640 --> 02:32:09.106]  We have no records at the agency here that would satisfy your request.
[02:32:10.948 --> 02:32:12.870]  Now this is completely astonishing.
[02:32:14.931 --> 02:32:20.236]  Talking about, yeah, there's a website for those of you who are watching here, Fluoride Free Peel.
[02:32:22.486 --> 02:32:29.612]  These public health agencies are admitting that they have no records proving that the virus has ever been isolated.
[02:32:30.073 --> 02:32:31.834]  And this isn't just one agency.
[02:32:31.854 --> 02:32:31.834]  46.
[02:32:34.216 --> 02:32:35.497]  We'll be back after the break.
[02:32:36.618 --> 02:32:38.220]  Back for the second segment here.
[02:32:38.280 --> 02:32:41.422]  Got two stories concerning Biden and Trump.
[02:32:43.064 --> 02:32:50.070]  Perhaps you've noticed that some of the governors are now talking about, well, we're going to loosen up the lockdown somewhat now.
[02:32:51.127 --> 02:32:53.988]  And because statistics show that blah, blah, blah.
[02:32:54.028 --> 02:32:58.470]  No, the statistics, which are all fake anyway, are not showing anything.
[02:32:59.771 --> 02:33:03.433]  It's obvious that, well, Biden has been installed as president.
[02:33:03.493 --> 02:33:10.056]  So now we've done our job, the governors are thinking, and so now we can start loosening up the lockdowns.
[02:33:10.936 --> 02:33:17.639]  Because, obviously, part of the whole scenario here was ensuring
[02:33:18.365 --> 02:33:42.889]  That titanic numbers of mail-in ballots would be used in the election, which would make stealing it very much easier and keeping people at home rather than showing up at the polls, which shows you the, I mean, this is, I mean, the depth, the depth of the need to get rid of Trump.
[02:33:44.429 --> 02:33:47.850]  The depth of that operation to get rid of him.
[02:33:48.541 --> 02:33:57.528]  Of course, we've seen over the past five, six years, predating this election in the first place, how serious that move was.
[02:33:58.228 --> 02:34:10.017]  But when you consider that, oh, it's very serious lockdowns, they're going to lock down everybody, lock down everybody, oh, Biden's locked, okay, well, you know, actually, we can loosen up the lockdowns a little bit now, for now anyway.
[02:34:10.778 --> 02:34:14.060]  And we do need to open up the economy, blah, blah, blah.
[02:34:14.701 --> 02:34:17.263]  I mean, talk about cynical.
[02:34:18.200 --> 02:34:25.962]  Criminality on the part of these grotesque, hideous, gargoyle governors.
[02:34:27.903 --> 02:34:29.283]  It's absolutely astounding.
[02:34:29.943 --> 02:34:36.205]  And so from there, we move to the impeachment process now taking place in the U.S.
[02:34:36.245 --> 02:34:39.426]  Senate to impeach Trump.
[02:34:41.067 --> 02:34:45.628]  It reminds me, if you remember the old comedy Animal House.
[02:34:46.894 --> 02:35:04.523]  Where the Dean tells the fraternity, actually you've been on, what did he call it, something like super secret probation, and you violated your probation, so therefore you're banned from campus.
[02:35:06.284 --> 02:35:14.408]  I mean, this impeachment trial, you know, raising serious constitutional questions?
[02:35:15.069 --> 02:35:15.289]  Come on.
[02:35:16.491 --> 02:35:29.320]  This is like a mock trial being staged at some hokey law school, which barely is able to graduate students.
[02:35:30.260 --> 02:35:43.429]  And the mock trial is being put on and carried out by the worst of those students, parading as if they're really lawyers, and in this case, really
[02:35:45.296 --> 02:35:47.438]  Legislators in the Senate.
[02:35:48.438 --> 02:36:10.215]  I mean the whole thing has absolutely no value meaning whatsoever except propaganda value for extreme yokels and rouges who actually think that the Constitution has something to say about impeaching a president who has already left office
[02:36:10.859 --> 02:36:38.606]  When in fact all you have to do is read the Constitution and you see A. that the impeachment trial has only to do with removing a sitting president, not a president who is no longer sitting but has left the presidency, and B. that this impeachment trial has to be presided over by the
[02:36:40.740 --> 02:36:53.169]  Head of the Supreme Court, Chief Justice, which in this case is John Roberts, who has said that he's not going to preside over this and that he really doesn't care to comment on why not.
[02:36:54.029 --> 02:36:58.453]  I mean, you know, this guy is supposed to be the number one lawyer in the country.
[02:36:59.213 --> 02:37:10.321]  So you would think that if he is saying, I'm not going to preside over this impeachment trial, that he's going to make a statement about why not.
[02:37:11.311 --> 02:37:14.252]  To inform the people of America.
[02:37:15.933 --> 02:37:16.153]  What?
[02:37:17.234 --> 02:37:18.575]  That the trial is a sham?
[02:37:19.115 --> 02:37:20.376]  That it isn't legitimate?
[02:37:20.496 --> 02:37:21.836]  It isn't constitutional?
[02:37:21.956 --> 02:37:22.737]  It isn't legal?
[02:37:22.837 --> 02:37:26.118]  It has absolutely no merit or meaning whatsoever?
[02:37:26.138 --> 02:37:32.221]  That it's nothing more than a propaganda exercise being carried out by rhinos and Democrats?
[02:37:33.042 --> 02:37:34.423]  He's going to say something.
[02:37:36.323 --> 02:37:37.524]  But he refrains.
[02:37:38.204 --> 02:37:39.385]  Ah yes, he refrains.
[02:37:40.169 --> 02:37:45.153]  And, of course, the media are going along with the following narrative.
[02:37:45.533 --> 02:37:56.941]  Well, you see, if it were an impeachment of a sitting president, then the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Roberts, would be presiding.
[02:37:57.501 --> 02:38:07.688]  But since this is a different sort of impeachment than Patrick Leahy, who has been serving in the Senate as a Democrat since 1843,
[02:38:09.855 --> 02:38:15.379]  He is stepping up to the plate to preside over this different kind of impeachment.
[02:38:15.499 --> 02:38:37.574]  Yeah, the different kind of impeachment, which is no impeachment whatsoever, which is at best a mock trial being carried out by idiots, which has no meaning whatsoever under the Constitution, no legal value, nothing whatsoever to do with fact or law in the United States.
[02:38:40.512 --> 02:38:54.118]  RINOs and Democrats are very seriously pretending that it does in fact have something to do with a legal proceeding.
[02:38:54.158 --> 02:38:58.660]  Which tells you something about these people and their character, right?
[02:38:59.820 --> 02:39:01.921]  Okay boys and girls, now here's the deal.
[02:39:02.742 --> 02:39:05.343]  Keep a straight face when you talk to the press.
[02:39:06.027 --> 02:39:07.508]  Don't break out in a grin.
[02:39:07.629 --> 02:39:20.421]  Don't start laughing uncontrollably when you say that we're going to stage an impeachment of a president who is no longer president in contravention of the Constitution.
[02:39:20.621 --> 02:39:31.211]  And that the Chief Justice is not going to preside, but we're going to take one of the oldest hack jobs in the Senate, Pat Leahy, and we're going to prop him up
[02:39:31.744 --> 02:39:36.706]  And put him there at the head to preside over this fake trial.
[02:39:37.107 --> 02:39:44.570]  Don't break up laughing and smiling and grinning and falling down because you can't stop laughing.
[02:39:44.590 --> 02:39:56.276]  You've got to keep a straight face about the whole thing as we proceed in impeaching the president who is not a president, who is now a private citizen.
[02:39:57.917 --> 02:39:58.157]  Right?
[02:40:00.117 --> 02:40:18.287]  And even if this fails, which it looks like it's going to, to get a two-thirds vote from the Senate, keep in mind, boys and girls, that we can always come back after the midterm elections if we get enough RINOs and Democrats to make it happen again.
[02:40:18.867 --> 02:40:22.209]  And we can impeach Trump 30 years from now if we have to.
[02:40:22.349 --> 02:40:27.692]  Whatever it takes to completely erase him and all of his supporters as if
[02:40:28.311 --> 02:40:50.736]  They never existed because they're dangerous, because they're extremely dangerous, because for one reason or another, we don't know why they care about something called freedom, which we're in the process of completely outlawing in every form that we can possibly think of so that we make everybody into slaves, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[02:40:54.636 --> 02:40:55.997]  That's the picture, folks.
[02:40:56.377 --> 02:41:01.901]  That's what's going on with the so-called impeachment that is taking place now in the Senate.
[02:41:04.003 --> 02:41:11.027]  And again, as I'm turning a page here in my notes, I have to take the lawyers to task.
[02:41:11.128 --> 02:41:18.733]  I'm talking about not the lawyers in the country who are speaking out and saying that the whole thing is a sham and a farce.
[02:41:19.457 --> 02:41:25.702]  But the thousands of other lawyers who know it's a sham and a farce and are not saying anything.
[02:41:26.643 --> 02:41:30.206]  I'm not talking about the fact they have to file cases in courts.
[02:41:30.587 --> 02:41:31.247]  They have to write.
[02:41:31.307 --> 02:41:32.288]  They have to speak out.
[02:41:32.708 --> 02:41:34.210]  They have to do podcasts.
[02:41:34.250 --> 02:41:35.471]  They have to go on shows.
[02:41:35.891 --> 02:41:38.113]  They have to say the whole thing is illegitimate.
[02:41:38.173 --> 02:41:39.374]  It's unconstitutional.
[02:41:39.434 --> 02:41:40.335]  It's insane.
[02:41:40.935 --> 02:41:46.220]  And any bar association that doesn't say it's insane loses all credibility.
[02:41:46.914 --> 02:41:48.255]  Why aren't they speaking up?
[02:41:48.315 --> 02:41:49.515]  Because they're cowards.
[02:41:50.335 --> 02:41:52.176]  Because they're fakes and frauds.
[02:41:52.777 --> 02:41:53.517]  That's why.
[02:41:53.617 --> 02:41:57.098]  Because they don't deserve to be called attorneys.
[02:41:59.079 --> 02:41:59.920]  We'll be back.
[02:42:00.080 --> 02:42:01.800]  Don't go anywhere after the break.
[02:42:02.080 --> 02:42:02.641]  Okay.
[02:42:02.781 --> 02:42:04.542]  Last segment here in this hour.
[02:42:04.922 --> 02:42:05.842]  John Rappaport.
[02:42:08.363 --> 02:42:10.564]  Gotta say something about Biden.
[02:42:13.345 --> 02:42:14.686]  This is another one of these.
[02:42:16.351 --> 02:42:18.692]  How can we possibly believe this?
[02:42:19.973 --> 02:42:24.715]  Talking about the mental incapacity of the man.
[02:42:26.375 --> 02:42:35.079]  You know, in 1990, 1988, he suffered a brain aneurysm and pulmonary thrombosis.
[02:42:35.920 --> 02:42:37.100]  Had two surgeries.
[02:42:37.680 --> 02:42:39.181]  This was very serious.
[02:42:40.081 --> 02:42:43.103]  Wasn't some, you know, little light business here.
[02:42:45.144 --> 02:42:45.364]  And to
[02:42:47.262 --> 02:42:55.906]  Anybody but the slumbering, his mental cognitive decline was obvious.
[02:42:57.247 --> 02:42:59.488]  There have been numerous videos made.
[02:42:59.528 --> 02:43:04.951]  You're looking at one who, if you're watching now with a pen, where do I put the pen?
[02:43:05.011 --> 02:43:06.552]  How do I get it in my pocket?
[02:43:08.333 --> 02:43:16.717]  He's walking out past a line of Marines and he says, salute the Marines, but he doesn't salute them.
[02:43:18.714 --> 02:43:19.995]  Uh, he's listening.
[02:43:20.035 --> 02:43:23.737]  It appears to somebody in his earpiece saying, salute the Marines.
[02:43:24.517 --> 02:43:28.039]  But instead of saluting them, he repeats what they're telling him.
[02:43:28.059 --> 02:43:30.761]  I mean, it just goes on and on and on and on.
[02:43:32.722 --> 02:43:34.843]  This was apparent long ago.
[02:43:37.064 --> 02:43:39.706]  To any except the slumbering.
[02:43:41.066 --> 02:43:44.208]  It was apparent when he announced for the presidency.
[02:43:44.228 --> 02:43:46.009]  It was apparent during the campaign.
[02:43:47.833 --> 02:43:57.959]  If you want to call it a campaign, I mean, he was talking with dozens of people who would show up at these little rallies and so forth.
[02:43:58.759 --> 02:44:03.482]  Very, very light campaigning, minimal to keep him away from the public.
[02:44:05.623 --> 02:44:11.327]  And gaffes and confusions and incoherence and so on and so.
[02:44:13.008 --> 02:44:14.128]  My point being.
[02:44:15.869 --> 02:44:17.010]  During the campaign.
[02:44:18.749 --> 02:44:30.976]  Did any Rhino Republican seriously hammer on this as being very dangerous?
[02:44:33.577 --> 02:44:45.944]  Did any mainstream media outlet hammer on this to say, hey, we're in the process of possibly electing, installing,
[02:44:47.486 --> 02:44:53.409]  A seriously impaired man as the next President of the United States.
[02:44:55.950 --> 02:44:57.810]  A disabled human.
[02:45:02.272 --> 02:45:04.433]  Where are his medical records?
[02:45:04.873 --> 02:45:11.256]  Eh, we understand they're confidential and so forth, but you see when somebody is running
[02:45:12.273 --> 02:45:25.060]  As a candidate for a major party for the presidency of the United States, doesn't it stand to reason that we have a right to know whether he is coherent?
[02:45:27.481 --> 02:45:38.927]  Whether he is cognitively challenged on a physical level to a very serious degree and is in rapid decline?
[02:45:40.848 --> 02:45:41.229]  Yes?
[02:45:41.249 --> 02:45:41.289]  No?
[02:45:42.409 --> 02:45:46.474]  Are we not able to find out this information?
[02:45:46.534 --> 02:45:50.198]  Because from all outward signs, that's what we're seeing.
[02:45:53.021 --> 02:46:01.210]  Doesn't matter if he's Democrat, Republican, Libertarian, Constitutional Party, Martian Party.
[02:46:01.871 --> 02:46:03.353]  What difference does it make?
[02:46:04.167 --> 02:46:17.818]  This guy could be elected as the next president and we demand to know and we are not going to stop demanding to know and I pointed this out in articles at the time.
[02:46:20.520 --> 02:46:22.842]  The guy is in serious trouble.
[02:46:23.362 --> 02:46:27.385]  That's what you would say if he was just another guy.
[02:46:28.286 --> 02:46:29.467]  He can't remember.
[02:46:29.547 --> 02:46:30.988]  He can't articulate.
[02:46:31.648 --> 02:46:31.969]  He's
[02:46:32.822 --> 02:46:35.163]  Confusing one thing with another.
[02:46:36.664 --> 02:46:48.729]  We're on the verge, possibly, of electing or installing or faking our way into putting this man in the Oval Office.
[02:46:54.392 --> 02:46:57.733]  But media outlets are under orders to stay away from this.
[02:46:57.854 --> 02:46:59.374]  Don't bring it up, etc.
[02:46:59.534 --> 02:46:59.774]  etc.
[02:46:59.814 --> 02:47:00.935]  Don't even mention it.
[02:47:01.587 --> 02:47:03.548]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:47:03.628 --> 02:47:16.958]  This is the only Democrat with any kind of name recognition who isn't considered too radical on the left like Sanders or Warren to, you know, even have a chance at the presidency.
[02:47:17.018 --> 02:47:18.519]  And we have to shut up about it.
[02:47:18.579 --> 02:47:19.720]  We can't talk about it.
[02:47:20.080 --> 02:47:21.121]  We can't bring it up.
[02:47:21.201 --> 02:47:22.442]  And that's just et cetera.
[02:47:22.462 --> 02:47:27.966]  And now we look around and there is this guy sitting in the Oval Office.
[02:47:33.331 --> 02:47:49.384]  I mean, when people say that America is beginning to look like a joke in the eyes of other nations, and they cite various ridiculous reasons for saying that, here's an actual reason for saying it.
[02:47:51.125 --> 02:47:52.426]  Look what they did in America.
[02:47:52.486 --> 02:47:58.831]  They elected this guy, and I'm not even confident that he knows his name all the time.
[02:48:06.266 --> 02:48:07.746]  It's just beyond appeal.
[02:48:07.906 --> 02:48:08.926]  It's beyond belief.
[02:48:12.347 --> 02:48:19.130]  With a guy like that, it doesn't matter what his policies are, because does he remember what his policies are?
[02:48:20.350 --> 02:48:21.290]  Does it matter?
[02:48:21.990 --> 02:48:30.253]  Because he's obviously being controlled as a puppet on strings by a committee, by people behind him.
[02:48:31.693 --> 02:48:39.220]  And those of you watching see a picture of Biden from the early years before, I would say, the surgeries and so forth.
[02:48:39.740 --> 02:48:55.014]  I watched him in the old, old, old, old days on the Sunday talk shows where he was a frequent guest as a foreign policy wonk in the Senate because he's been in the Senate forever.
[02:48:57.636 --> 02:48:58.657]  He was a sharp talker.
[02:49:01.112 --> 02:49:05.495]  I didn't agree with what he was saying or his policies, but he was a sharp talker.
[02:49:05.915 --> 02:49:06.555]  He was quick.
[02:49:08.016 --> 02:49:13.800]  You know, one of the usual idiot hosts would ask him a softball question and he would give you the answer.
[02:49:13.820 --> 02:49:16.421]  Russia, you see, here's what Russia has actually been doing.
[02:49:16.461 --> 02:49:18.222]  And this is what we have to do.
[02:49:18.863 --> 02:49:21.004]  And here we've tried these negotiations, whatever.
[02:49:21.664 --> 02:49:28.028]  He was fully cognizant, aware of his mental capacity and was exercising it.
[02:49:28.740 --> 02:49:32.101]  But all of that has completely changed.
[02:49:35.383 --> 02:49:56.311]  And America has descended, at least half of it anyway, into the depths of such idiocracy that an entire presidential campaign could be conducted and nobody in major media or major politics hammers on the fact
[02:49:56.914 --> 02:50:17.526]  Relentlessly, over and over again, that we have to see this guy's records, medical records, because we could be electing somebody who is medically incompetent, who is severely disabled, as president.
[02:50:19.027 --> 02:50:19.768]  Didn't happen.
[02:50:20.748 --> 02:50:21.869]  Didn't happen at all.
[02:50:22.650 --> 02:50:24.851]  Yeah, there were occasional mentions of this.
[02:50:25.430 --> 02:50:28.631]  And people would giggle and say, can you believe this guy?
[02:50:29.031 --> 02:50:30.191]  I'm not talking about that.
[02:50:31.571 --> 02:50:32.832]  I'm not talking about that.
[02:50:38.773 --> 02:50:47.235]  This gives you an indication of where the hypnotic level and the IQ level of at least half the country
[02:50:48.425 --> 02:50:48.885]  Have some.
[02:50:49.026 --> 02:50:53.709]  And you could say, well, they just didn't care because all they wanted to do was get rid of Trump.
[02:50:53.769 --> 02:50:58.272]  And it didn't matter which Democrat they dragged across the finish line.
[02:50:58.612 --> 02:50:59.933]  In this case, it was Biden.
[02:51:01.234 --> 02:51:02.355]  Yeah, true.
[02:51:02.995 --> 02:51:09.220]  But again, the man is severely disabled.
[02:51:11.301 --> 02:51:11.841]  Meaning.
[02:51:13.603 --> 02:51:16.705]  Totally unreliable in what he says.
[02:51:17.409 --> 02:51:29.872]  Thinks, remembers, signs, you know, as an executive orders, signs, advocates from day to day.
[02:51:34.833 --> 02:51:39.574]  And I can hear people saying, well, yeah, but you know, so what?
[02:51:42.935 --> 02:51:43.775]  Yeah, so what?
[02:51:45.936 --> 02:51:46.996]  So what, huh?
[02:51:48.638 --> 02:51:56.743]  I mean, of course, it's obvious Kamala Harris is waiting in the wings to take over when Biden is unable to finish his term and all of that.
[02:51:56.763 --> 02:52:01.887]  We understand all of this New World Order accelerates, etc, etc.
[02:52:01.927 --> 02:52:05.269]  But I'm just getting to the ground level fact here.
[02:52:07.630 --> 02:52:13.074]  The nation has to be rescued from basic idiocracy completely.
[02:52:13.914 --> 02:52:21.557]  Thinking people have to think and speak out on every level as to what is going on.
[02:52:22.597 --> 02:52:23.657]  John Rappaport here.
[02:52:24.097 --> 02:52:24.958]  We're in for wars.
[02:52:29.619 --> 02:52:33.120]  X2 is an essential nutrient.
[02:52:33.781 --> 02:52:38.462]  It is clean, pure atomic iodine from 12,000 foot deep crystals.
[02:52:39.142 --> 02:52:41.003]  There's a byproduct of oil and gas drilling.
[02:52:42.247 --> 02:52:46.709]  We're the only ones to ever go out and actually get this type of, this type of true, pure, atomic iodine.
[02:52:46.749 --> 02:52:48.349]  We have to get a DEA license to get it.
[02:52:48.669 --> 02:52:49.109]  It's crazy.
[02:52:49.129 --> 02:52:50.470]  It goes right into your cells.
[02:52:50.550 --> 02:52:51.250]  It's essential.
[02:52:51.730 --> 02:52:55.412]  It's the good halogen, the opposite of fluoride and bromide and bromine and all of that.
[02:52:55.892 --> 02:52:57.272]  Look into the iodine conspiracy.
[02:52:57.292 --> 02:52:58.313]  This is the best you're going to get.
[02:52:59.153 --> 02:52:59.974]  It's back in stock.
[02:53:00.354 --> 02:53:01.455]  X2 sold out for months.
[02:53:02.216 --> 02:53:03.096]  50% off.
[02:53:03.137 --> 02:53:03.977]  People are very excited.
[02:53:04.458 --> 02:53:06.900]  Also back in stock after eight months because the COVID lockdown.
[02:53:07.120 --> 02:53:08.021]  Couldn't get it from France.
[02:53:08.641 --> 02:53:09.242]  Pollen Block.
[02:53:09.342 --> 02:53:10.903]  It's from specially fed quail.
[02:53:11.384 --> 02:53:13.145]  Their eggs have this natural antihistamine.
[02:53:13.606 --> 02:53:14.146]  It's amazing.
[02:53:14.186 --> 02:53:14.707]  People love it.
[02:53:16.068 --> 02:53:17.649]  It gives you that anti-allergy effect.
[02:53:17.829 --> 02:53:24.335]  Also, back in stock is our fluoride-free concentrated charcoal, activated charcoal toothpaste that my dad developed.
[02:53:24.355 --> 02:53:25.116]  He's a retired dentist.
[02:53:25.136 --> 02:53:27.759]  I want to thank you all for shopping with us and supporting us.
[02:53:27.999 --> 02:53:29.220]  Without you, we would not be on air.
[02:53:44.776 --> 02:53:48.920]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[02:53:49.340 --> 02:53:51.142]  Let's go ahead and talk to Diana in Michigan.
[02:53:51.162 --> 02:53:52.223]  You're on the air, thanks for holding.
[02:53:52.283 --> 02:53:52.603]  Hello.
[02:53:52.703 --> 02:53:53.444]  Hi, welcome.
[02:53:53.504 --> 02:54:02.892]  Okay, I want to plug your InfoWars mask, although I know that we are all against masks and that it's just basically a symbol of, you know, conformity and inflation.
[02:54:02.932 --> 02:54:03.452]  We're good to go!
[02:54:28.229 --> 02:54:30.272]  And you know, so it doesn't inhibit my breathing.
[02:54:30.292 --> 02:54:35.078]  I wear it underneath my nose and it's kind of like lets people know that I don't really believe in the mask either.
[02:54:35.138 --> 02:54:36.560]  I'm wearing it just because I have to.
[02:54:36.580 --> 02:54:38.823]  I live in Governor Whitmer's horrible state.
[02:54:38.883 --> 02:54:46.913]  But I do want to say I did see one other person wear it at first earlier this year when you first came out with it and I literally got brought to tears because
[02:54:47.313 --> 02:54:52.657]  I saw another person that believes like I do, and I didn't feel all alone out in this world.
[02:54:52.897 --> 02:54:57.920]  And it meant so much to me to see someone taking action, so I went ahead and ordered one for myself.
[02:54:58.200 --> 02:55:02.343]  And I swear to God, and I just had a baby too, on the 7th of December.
[02:55:02.543 --> 02:55:03.484]  Oh, congratulations!
[02:55:29.241 --> 02:55:31.122]  Diana, I'm so glad you got through.
[02:55:31.182 --> 02:55:35.604]  God bless you and congratulations on that new wonderful life that you have brought into the world.
[02:55:36.004 --> 02:55:37.385]  And I only wish the best for your new baby.
[02:55:38.346 --> 02:55:39.206]  I'm glad she called.
[02:55:39.246 --> 02:55:40.487]  This is bigger than Alex Jones.
[02:55:41.007 --> 02:55:46.530]  And this is one of my frustration points in my mind that people don't seem to get.
[02:55:46.550 --> 02:55:52.593]  And when I've in general talked about Pharisees, I'm not talking about any particular individual.
[02:55:53.533 --> 02:55:56.275]  I'm talking about the way a Pharisee brain works is
[02:55:57.825 --> 02:55:58.946]  Very one-dimensional.
[02:55:58.986 --> 02:56:02.648]  Like, you say the masks are a fraud and cause bacterial pneumonia.
[02:56:03.008 --> 02:56:04.129]  You say they don't protect you.
[02:56:04.169 --> 02:56:05.669]  You say they're a symbol of slavery.
[02:56:05.749 --> 02:56:08.031]  Then what are you doing selling masks?
[02:56:08.211 --> 02:56:23.139]  Well, when we launched them, I made the decision to print it with Infowars.com so if you're on a plane or in a restaurant where it's a private place and they're making you do it and you need to go there for whatever reason, you wear it to fight back and then use the abuse like a judo move.
[02:56:23.459 --> 02:56:26.341]  They attack you, you use their momentum to throw them through the wall.
[02:56:31.095 --> 02:56:42.944]  Separately, you remember me in the last six months ahead of the election saying we're trying to sell all the products out at discount prices because we're not going to even have that much stuff in the warehouse the new year because if Biden steals the election, they plan to shut us down.
[02:56:43.524 --> 02:56:44.725]  Well, you now see that all over the news.
[02:56:45.065 --> 02:56:45.966]  Arrest Alex Jones.
[02:56:46.006 --> 02:56:46.926]  Shut Alex Jones down.
[02:56:47.947 --> 02:56:54.734]  That's why if you want to go to InfoWarsTore.com and get a t-shirt or get a book or get the supplements, I would suggest you stock up now.
[02:56:54.754 --> 02:57:03.683]  We need to bring in as much money as we can to operate into the future if we have our banking taking away, which they've already done at many levels, but now they're closing in for the full takeover and
[02:57:03.763 --> 02:57:05.384]  And look, don't worry, you'll be joining me.
[02:57:05.504 --> 02:57:06.804]  They plan to never turn the U.S.
[02:57:06.844 --> 02:57:07.644]  economy back on.
[02:57:07.765 --> 02:57:09.125]  Never take their boot off your neck.
[02:57:09.185 --> 02:57:09.665]  The U.S.
[02:57:09.805 --> 02:57:11.366]  is slated for total destruction.
[02:57:11.446 --> 02:57:16.848]  Now, there may still be time to turn this around, but I just want you to know, in what could be some of our last broadcast here, where this is going.
[02:57:16.968 --> 02:57:19.849]  If I was you, we've got 2020 prices on storable food.
[02:57:19.869 --> 02:57:21.870]  The prices, they've extended until Friday.
[02:57:21.950 --> 02:57:22.710]  Then they will go up.
[02:57:22.810 --> 02:57:24.451]  People are buying through an explosive rate.
[02:57:24.531 --> 02:57:26.072]  Go to preparewithalex.com.
[02:57:26.172 --> 02:57:29.593]  That takes you right to the subpage of infowarestore.com, where you'll find
[02:57:29.813 --> 02:57:34.480]  The best deals in the industry on high quality, fresh, durable food the last 25 years with great packaging.
[02:57:34.560 --> 02:57:35.822]  Preparewithalex.com.
[02:57:35.982 --> 02:57:37.184]  One year supplies up to $850 off.
[02:57:37.264 --> 02:57:41.610]  Last year's prices and discounts, it will go up, I'm told, one way or another.
[02:57:41.730 --> 02:57:43.352]  Next Saturday, it's extended through Friday.
[02:57:43.432 --> 02:57:44.834]  Preparewithalex.com.
[02:57:44.935 --> 02:57:45.756]  Preparewithalex.com.
[02:57:46.056 --> 02:57:46.496]  I think so.
[02:58:03.490 --> 02:58:04.030]  We're good to go.
