[00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:08.031]  But it is not too crazy to think that an outbreak of a novel avian virus could occur in China somewhere.
[00:00:08.451 --> 00:00:21.734]  We could get the RNA sequence from that, beam it to a number of regional centers, if not local, if not even in your home at some point, and print those vaccines on a patch and self-administer.
[00:00:21.834 --> 00:00:23.594]  This is a societal level collapse.
[00:00:23.934 --> 00:00:25.074]  They call it the Great Reset.
[00:00:25.094 --> 00:00:26.915]  This is their global domination.
[00:00:26.995 --> 00:00:27.475]  This is it.
[00:00:27.295 --> 00:00:34.295]  This is it. This is modern war.
[00:00:34.295 --> 00:00:43.295]  InfoWars. Tomorrow's news. Today.
[00:00:43.295 --> 00:00:43.795]  made.
[00:00:44.708 --> 00:00:50.074]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this emergency Monday night broadcast.
[00:00:50.655 --> 00:00:52.637]  It is October 4th, 2021.
[00:00:53.298 --> 00:00:57.843]  I had to come back in a few hours ago when I learned of these developments.
[00:00:58.806 --> 00:01:20.827]  The last piece fell into the jigsaw puzzle, proving and documenting that COVID-19 was a premeditated weapon produced in China in a consortium of corporations with the United Nations to bring in world government, to bring in this incredible Great Reset police state, and to establish a medical tyranny.
[00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.411]  Now, we already have a lot of the pieces of this.
[00:01:24.431 --> 00:01:25.691]  We're going to go over some of that.
[00:01:25.771 --> 00:01:35.353]  But the new smoking gun information took place three years ago on C-SPAN and got no attention or no news coverage.
[00:01:35.373 --> 00:01:35.873]  We checked it.
[00:01:36.273 --> 00:01:46.396]  A listener sent us to this information this afternoon, and we've been reviewing it since in the last three hours, getting prepared for this emergency.
[00:01:47.336 --> 00:01:48.477]  Transmission again.
[00:01:48.517 --> 00:01:50.058]  I'm here live every day 11 a.m.
[00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:51.659]  To 3 p.m.
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.660]  Owens at 3 p.m.
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.361]  With the war room.
[00:01:53.381 --> 00:01:59.345]  We have of course Harrison Smith doing a great job with American Journal every weekday morning 8 a.m.
[00:01:59.386 --> 00:02:02.648]  Here at Infowars and on great stations across the country.
[00:02:02.688 --> 00:02:05.370]  We're so thankful for all you tuning in and keeping us on air.
[00:02:05.831 --> 00:02:14.878]  But when this information came out, I left the office Rob do our news director contacted me and said have you seen this information?
[00:02:15.558 --> 00:02:17.021]  And I said no.
[00:02:17.241 --> 00:02:23.671]  So he sent it to me and I turned around and came back into the office to cover this.
[00:02:23.732 --> 00:02:26.556]  And we're going to hit it right now.
[00:02:26.636 --> 00:02:33.278]   But I'm begging all of you To research this yourself and then to take this information and share it with everyone.
[00:02:33.818 --> 00:02:36.540]  And we're not territorial about news.
[00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.741]  We hope everybody shares this.
[00:02:38.761 --> 00:02:41.163]  Yes, there's what the listener sent us from BitChute.
[00:02:41.823 --> 00:02:43.525]  It only has a few thousand views.
[00:02:44.385 --> 00:02:48.128]  And this is the smoking gun of smoking gun experts.
[00:02:49.328 --> 00:02:52.711]  Talk about disruption needed to switch from egg-based to mRNA.
[00:02:54.229 --> 00:03:11.741]  But what it really is, is the final piece of the jigsaw puzzle of the premeditation, because we have all the other pieces, how they cooked it, how they built it, how they delivered it, how they admitted they were going to do it, and how they were already prepared with the vaccine patents for what they had produced.
[00:03:12.382 --> 00:03:18.326]  And so we're about to play this clip, and then I'm going to get to other clips that give you the other pieces of the puzzle.
[00:03:18.346 --> 00:03:19.787]  But this is the final big piece.
[00:03:19.827 --> 00:03:25.277]   This is Smoking Gun, October 29th, 2019.
[00:03:26.198 --> 00:03:28.079]  So this is three years ago.
[00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.521]  A little short of three years ago.
[00:03:30.581 --> 00:03:40.389]  And it's Anthony Fauci, National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease Director, with Rick Bright, HHS Biomedical Advanced R&D Director.
[00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:43.170]  Health and Human Services.
[00:03:43.851 --> 00:04:07.581]  And he's saying we need to have a virus released that's almost identical to COVID-19 out of China, so that we can bypass the normal FDA approval and how we've been making vaccines since the 40s, growing them on eggs with fetal tissue, I would add, and other animal tissues, so that we can break through all that and basically force mRNA on the general public.
[00:04:08.991 --> 00:04:18.820]  Now understand just a year and a half before that, Fauci was on TV saying Trump will be challenged by a novel virus and an outbreak that's going to be new.
[00:04:19.541 --> 00:04:21.123]  And so this has been premeditated for a while.
[00:04:21.143 --> 00:04:29.010]  And now we have the Daszak documents and the Fauci documents, the Bill Gates documents in China, how they developed this exact system.
[00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:47.982]  So we're going to go to this clip, and then again we have Fauci predicting Trump will have a pandemic, and then Peter Daszak admitting in December 2019, when we know now it had already been released, that they had gone in these caves and dug out these different viruses, combined them, and then made it where they could jump into humans, the famous gain of function.
[00:04:48.002 --> 00:04:59.574]   Then of course I have this article out of The Telegraph from a few weeks ago, Wuhan scientist planned to release coronavirus particles into cave bats, leaked paper reveals And the Pentagon said, "Do not do this," when they
[00:04:59.574 --> 00:05:02.973]   approached them and said they were going to do it, because they said, "We'll get into humans in China." So
[00:05:02.973 --> 00:05:07.435]   this is all illegal. This is all over the top, but they needed it, not just for their
[00:05:07.435 --> 00:05:14.403]   medical takeover, but for the global ID, the global vaccine passport that'll then be the heart of
[00:05:14.403 --> 00:05:20.673]   the new global social credit score and the universal guaranteed income. After they devalue all the
[00:05:20.673 --> 00:05:25.524]   world's currencies and use those to buy up the infrastructure, then they give us the debt, they give
[00:05:25.524 --> 00:05:30.683]   us the inflation, they give us the evaluation, implode everything and bring in the new monetary system to
[00:05:30.683 --> 00:05:31.774]  replace Bretton Woods.
[00:05:32.013 --> 00:05:36.837]  This is all announced in the Great Reset written 20 months ago by Klaus Schwab that runs this whole thing.
[00:05:37.718 --> 00:05:41.701]  It is all there and now we're living it, now we're deep into it.
[00:05:42.842 --> 00:05:46.716]  Here is the smoking gun video from C-SPAN.
[00:05:49.106 --> 00:05:50.608]  Why don't we blow the system up?
[00:05:50.928 --> 00:05:59.696]  I mean, obviously we can't just turn off the spigot on the system we have and then say, hey, everyone in the world should get this new vaccine we haven't given to anyone yet.
[00:06:00.136 --> 00:06:07.082]  But there must be some way that we grow vaccines mostly in eggs the way we did in 1947.
[00:06:08.103 --> 00:06:23.660]   In order to make the transition from getting out of the tried and true I mean, we've done well with that, to something that has to be much better.
[00:06:24.841 --> 00:06:39.150]  You have to prove that this works, and then you've got to go through all of the clinical trials, phase 1s, phase 2s, phase 3, and then show that this particular product is going to be good over a period of years.
[00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:44.633]  That alone, if it works perfectly, is going to take a decade.
[00:06:44.813 --> 00:06:58.002]  There might be a need or even an urgent call for an entity of excitement out there that's completely disruptive, that's not beholden to bureaucratic strings and processes.
[00:06:58.363 --> 00:07:17.593]   So we really do have a problem of how the world perceives influenza and it's going to be very difficult to change that unless you do it from within and say, I don't care what your perception is, we're going to address the problem in a disruptive way and in an iterative way, because you do need both.
[00:07:17.873 --> 00:07:25.855]  But it is not too crazy to think that an outbreak of a novel avian virus could occur in China somewhere.
[00:07:26.275 --> 00:07:39.438]  We could get the RNA sequence from that, beam it to a number of regional centers, if not local, if not even in your home at some point, and print those vaccines on a patch and self-administer.
[00:07:40.706 --> 00:07:45.129]  So there's the whole plan laid out and it's in the Rockefeller Foundation plan lockstep.
[00:07:45.249 --> 00:07:47.451]  It's in the Bill Gates event 201.
[00:07:47.932 --> 00:07:52.655]  We've gone over this here, but I'm going to play this clip of clips again and start it and stop it.
[00:07:52.675 --> 00:07:53.175]  Did you hear that?
[00:07:53.256 --> 00:08:02.022]  An intimacy, an entity of excitement, an entity of excitement, of hysteria, of fear, a monster for the great reset.
[00:08:02.623 --> 00:08:08.307]  That's the head of all the research and development, the director at the HHS and their whole medical takeover.
[00:08:10.043 --> 00:08:11.405]  And they go through all of this.
[00:08:11.505 --> 00:08:15.431]  Blow the whole system up, says the New Yorker.
[00:08:15.752 --> 00:08:18.936]  We've got to get rid of this old vaccine system.
[00:08:19.417 --> 00:08:22.782]  We've got to come out with genetic engineering, mRNA.
[00:08:22.922 --> 00:08:24.865]  They go on in the full C-SPAN clip.
[00:08:25.886 --> 00:08:26.666]  It's in the description.
[00:08:26.686 --> 00:08:28.247]  I went to the C-SPAN site.
[00:08:28.847 --> 00:08:31.829]  I mean, this is just unbelievable.
[00:08:31.869 --> 00:08:40.012]  We've got to go get that full interview, that full two-hour program, and help play that on the show tomorrow, because it gets worse, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:40.512 --> 00:08:42.313]  They are there saying, blow it all up.
[00:08:42.693 --> 00:08:44.074]  We need this entity of fear.
[00:08:44.434 --> 00:08:52.577]  We need to have a virus that appears, helpfully, out of China, where they had the Wuhan lab, where they had it already, where they had it prepared.
[00:08:52.737 --> 00:09:05.121]   And then, two months after this, Peter Daszak is bragging in December of 2019 that they had combined these viruses, that is the COVID virus, COVID-19, with the HIV delivery system to get it into humans.
[00:09:06.242 --> 00:09:08.425]  And it's all right there.
[00:09:08.445 --> 00:09:15.793]  We're going to play those clips for you in a moment, but first let's go back and play the clip and I will make comments as we go.
[00:09:15.833 --> 00:09:16.134]  Here it is.
[00:09:18.045 --> 00:09:19.566]  Why don't we blow the system up?
[00:09:19.866 --> 00:09:28.630]  I mean, obviously, we can't just turn off the spigot on the system we have and then say, hey, everyone in the world should get this new vaccine we haven't given to anyone yet.
[00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:35.413]  But there must be some way that we grow vaccines, mostly in eggs, the way we did in.
[00:09:35.513 --> 00:09:38.374]  I said, boss, we're going to back it up.
[00:09:38.394 --> 00:09:40.415]  People don't think we changed it back into the beginning again.
[00:09:41.555 --> 00:09:43.016]  We're going to play it after I'm done, but let me just.
[00:09:44.119 --> 00:09:46.020]  Why don't we just blow it up?
[00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:48.881]  Couldn't there be some thing we could do?
[00:09:48.901 --> 00:10:02.768]  They've all behind closed doors, had their meetings, created their consensus years before, in operation lockstep, crimson contagion, SARS, SPARS, all these drills they've done.
[00:10:03.993 --> 00:10:12.061]  They create their backstory about the bats are going to get you and oh, they're going to emerge out of a cave, they said five years ago, and get you while they're breeding it and getting it out of the cave and making it.
[00:10:12.682 --> 00:10:14.884]  And Peter Daszak says, we'll make a vaccine to be the saviors.
[00:10:15.445 --> 00:10:18.208]  He said that two months after the video you just saw.
[00:10:19.229 --> 00:10:21.411]  So they're premeditating it all, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:22.072 --> 00:10:23.093]  They love to brag.
[00:10:23.133 --> 00:10:23.913]  They love to tell you.
[00:10:24.793 --> 00:10:27.054]  And then it goes to Fauci goes, Oh, yeah, it's terrible.
[00:10:27.414 --> 00:10:29.476]  It takes 10 years, we can't have this.
[00:10:30.356 --> 00:10:47.245]  There was just something to get rid of the old system, which now they say, Oh, mRNA for cancer, mRNA for the cold, mRNA for this, mRNA for that, mRNA for the flu, mRNA, mRNA, mRNA, this whole system of Oh, just a digital system that just changes your DNA.
[00:10:48.526 --> 00:10:50.207]  Alright, so start from the beginning again.
[00:10:52.758 --> 00:10:54.280]  Why don't we blow this system up?
[00:10:54.580 --> 00:11:03.348]  I mean, obviously we can't just turn off the spigot on the system we have and then say, hey, everyone in the world should get this new vaccine we haven't given to anyone yet.
[00:11:03.788 --> 00:11:10.154]  But there must be some way that we grow vaccines mostly in eggs the way we did in 1947.
[00:11:10.375 --> 00:11:14.618]  In order to make the pause back into the beginning of Fauci.
[00:11:14.658 --> 00:11:16.040]  Now, the reason I'm doing this is very important.
[00:11:16.718 --> 00:11:17.739]  They're pitch men.
[00:11:17.779 --> 00:11:18.860]  They've prepared all this.
[00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:19.801]  They've done white papers.
[00:11:19.821 --> 00:11:21.162]  They've done tabletop exercises.
[00:11:21.442 --> 00:11:23.464]  They've met dozens of times to prepare all this.
[00:11:23.964 --> 00:11:26.907]  I know the same people have been at dozens of meetings behind closed doors.
[00:11:26.967 --> 00:11:28.028]  The documents have now come out.
[00:11:29.129 --> 00:11:33.653]  But now here they are saying on a stage what they are about to release.
[00:11:34.274 --> 00:11:36.415]  It's going to ravage the world in just a few months at the beginning of 2020.
[00:11:38.422 --> 00:11:40.183]  In fact, evidence shows it was already out in October.
[00:11:40.944 --> 00:11:42.485]  Oh, couldn't we do something?
[00:11:43.165 --> 00:11:46.388]  This is the plan to get rid of Trump, get rid of Bolsonaro, the plan to bring in globalism.
[00:11:46.848 --> 00:11:48.009]  And what would we do?
[00:11:48.289 --> 00:11:49.470]  Well, you'd then trample it.
[00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:50.791]  You wouldn't do the test.
[00:11:50.811 --> 00:11:53.092]  You wouldn't do the studies that Fauci's about to talk about.
[00:11:53.412 --> 00:11:54.633]  You'd overrun all of that.
[00:11:54.974 --> 00:11:57.255]  You'd demonize and attack anybody that didn't accept it.
[00:11:57.575 --> 00:11:59.637]  This is, as I've said a hundred times, a revolution.
[00:11:59.836 --> 00:12:02.716]   of getting rid of our old system, bringing in something far worse.
[00:12:02.716 --> 00:12:07.676]   A medical dictatorship saying it owns your body and it's going to control where you go and what
[00:12:07.676 --> 00:12:11.515]   you do. And just like they've said in Australia, we do whatever the health minister says,
[00:12:11.515 --> 00:12:15.196]   they're the leader. You won't accept a president or prime minister being a dictator,
[00:12:15.196 --> 00:12:21.196]   but if it's the health minister saying you are non-essential, well then you will accept it.
[00:12:21.196 --> 00:12:25.836]  That's how the fear works.
[00:12:26.078 --> 00:12:27.059]  That's how the control works.
[00:12:27.079 --> 00:12:28.719]  So he says, what do we do?
[00:12:28.739 --> 00:12:30.060]  We need to get rid of the system.
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:32.801]  And here comes Fauci to talk about what the problem is.
[00:12:33.382 --> 00:12:45.387]  And then the other operative from HHS, he gives a solution to blow up the system, the new entity, the new fear, the new virus that seems to be needed to do this.
[00:12:45.427 --> 00:12:46.488]  And then it magically appears.
[00:12:46.508 --> 00:12:46.808]  Here it is.
[00:12:48.661 --> 00:13:04.241]   In order to make the transition from getting out of the tried and true I mean, we've done well with that, to something that has to be much better.
[00:13:05.422 --> 00:13:19.732]  You have to prove that this works, and then you've got to go through all of the clinical trials, phase 1's, phase 2's, phase 3, and then show that this particular product is going to be good over a period of years.
[00:13:20.493 --> 00:13:25.216]  That alone, if it works perfectly, is going to take a decade.
[00:13:25.376 --> 00:13:38.585]  There might be a need or even an urgent call for an entity of excitement out there that's completely disruptive, that's not beholden to bureaucratic strings and processes.
[00:13:38.945 --> 00:13:54.135]  So we really do have a problem of how the world perceives influenza and it's going to be very difficult to change that unless you do it from within and say, I don't care what your perception is, we're going to address the problem.
[00:13:55.489 --> 00:13:56.050]  Back it up again.
[00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:57.691]  We don't care what your perception is.
[00:13:57.711 --> 00:14:01.194]  We're going to address the problem of influenza because people aren't scared enough of it.
[00:14:01.234 --> 00:14:02.335]  They're not taking their shots.
[00:14:02.415 --> 00:14:08.521]  It's really your piggyback to sterilize you and lower fertility and all the things we know destroy your immune system.
[00:14:08.541 --> 00:14:09.382]  That's been in all the studies.
[00:14:09.983 --> 00:14:11.184]  And so they want to make us pod people.
[00:14:11.224 --> 00:14:11.724]  They control.
[00:14:11.744 --> 00:14:14.186]  They want to make us GMO like Terminator seeds.
[00:14:14.927 --> 00:14:16.488]  And so he says it doesn't matter.
[00:14:16.788 --> 00:14:20.050]  Yeah, disrupt is part of it, but also, you know, inside the system.
[00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:24.813]  So, so attack the system from without, and then make it change from within under the pressure you put it under.
[00:14:25.113 --> 00:14:31.417]  Just like attacking the police to make them go under globalist control, or bullying a corporation to make them become woke.
[00:14:32.338 --> 00:14:35.880]  It's all the process of behavioral psychology and Pavlovian control.
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:37.701]  So let's go to the last key statement.
[00:14:39.525 --> 00:14:56.938]  The world perceives influenza and it's going to be very difficult to change that unless you do it from within and say, I don't care what your perception is, we're going to address the problem in a disruptive way and in an iterative way because you do need both.
[00:14:57.419 --> 00:14:57.959]  Stop there.
[00:14:58.199 --> 00:14:58.980]  Back it up three seconds.
[00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:01.342]  So he just agrees with it.
[00:15:02.242 --> 00:15:03.223]  We need to blow it up.
[00:15:03.303 --> 00:15:04.624]  We need the disruptive thing.
[00:15:04.664 --> 00:15:05.585]  We need the problem.
[00:15:06.974 --> 00:15:09.556]  But also using the system, don't totally blow it up.
[00:15:10.036 --> 00:15:12.798]  This is all a Galean Dialectic problem, reaction, solution.
[00:15:13.078 --> 00:15:21.643]  We're engaging on Galean Dialectics in front of you, selling the idea for the press that's in the gallery and those watching are now externalizing their takeover system.
[00:15:23.064 --> 00:15:26.266]  After they create the fear and the whole event and create the virus in China.
[00:15:26.426 --> 00:15:27.186]  And it's all confirmed.
[00:15:27.326 --> 00:15:27.887]  It's all admitted.
[00:15:27.927 --> 00:15:28.367]  They made it.
[00:15:28.407 --> 00:15:28.807]  They did it.
[00:15:30.888 --> 00:15:36.532]  China normally puts you in a death camp if you put a video out, encourage people to run around hysterically and put out a bunch of fake footage.
[00:15:39.264 --> 00:15:42.985]  We all run to our houses and come back out with vaccine passports and our slaves.
[00:15:45.906 --> 00:15:48.707]  Okay, so let's go ahead now and finish up with the last part of the clip.
[00:15:50.667 --> 00:15:58.649]  But it is not too crazy to think that an outbreak of a novel avian virus could occur in China somewhere.
[00:15:59.069 --> 00:16:08.652]  We could get the RNA sequence from that, beam it to a number of regional centers, if not local, if not even in your home at some point.
[00:16:10.766 --> 00:16:19.334]  Oh, in China, where you've got an agreement to build it, do it, and they were on board to create the hysteria, and then like dominoes we'd fall.
[00:16:20.074 --> 00:16:20.575]  There you go.
[00:16:20.675 --> 00:16:23.878]  So now let's move on to January 2017.
[00:16:24.418 --> 00:16:32.606]  Fauci predicting what he was already funding at Wuhan and running, the gain of function, and that what Trump would be facing, what America would be facing.
[00:16:32.806 --> 00:16:33.147]  Here it is.
[00:16:34.349 --> 00:16:52.921]  Given, as you heard from the introduction, that I have been around for a while and have had the opportunity and the privilege and the pleasure of serving in five administrations, I thought I would bring that perspective to the topic today is the issue of pandemic preparedness.
[00:16:53.181 --> 00:17:07.248]   And if there's one message That I want to leave with you today based on my experience, and you'll see that in a moment, is that there is no question that there will be a challenge to the coming administration in the arena.
[00:17:07.408 --> 00:17:19.195]  There will be a challenge to the coming administration in the arena of infectious diseases, both chronic infectious diseases in the sense of already ongoing disease, and we have certainly a large burden of that.
[00:17:19.754 --> 00:17:27.354]  but also there will be a surprise outbreak.
[00:17:27.354 --> 00:17:33.954]   And I hope by the end of my relatively short presentation, you will understand why history,
[00:17:33.954 --> 00:17:38.354]   the history of the last 32 years that I've been the director of NIAID,
[00:17:38.354 --> 00:17:39.754]  will tell...
[00:17:39.781 --> 00:17:47.672]  The next administration that there's no doubt in anyone's mind that they will be faced with the challenges that their predecessors were faced with.
[00:17:47.692 --> 00:17:55.022]  Now let's hear the other infamous clip from Peter Daszak running the whole program at Wuhan under Fauci and Gates on record.
[00:17:55.903 --> 00:17:56.304]  Daszak?
[00:17:57.987 --> 00:18:01.970]  On this week with Virology Podcast, talking about viruses and vaccine development.
[00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:03.851]  And it's an hour-long podcast.
[00:18:03.891 --> 00:18:06.273]  We've posted it at Mandot Video because they tried to take it down.
[00:18:06.733 --> 00:18:17.800]  Here he is, now that we know the outbreak was already going, putting out the cover story that, oh yeah, we went and got a bunch of stuff out of these caves and we put them together and so made it where humans can be infected so we could come out with vaccines.
[00:18:17.821 --> 00:18:18.181]  Here it is.
[00:18:19.295 --> 00:18:20.216]  Where did they come from?
[00:18:20.336 --> 00:18:36.453]  And we went out to southern China and did surveillance of bats across southern China and we've now found, after six or seven years of doing this, over a hundred new SARS-related coronaviruses, very close to SARS.
[00:18:36.954 --> 00:18:38.435]  Some of them get into human cells.
[00:18:39.176 --> 00:18:40.378]  In the lab.
[00:18:40.778 --> 00:18:52.153]  Some of them can cause SARS disease in humanized mouse models and are untreatable with therapeutic monoclonals and you can't vaccinate against them with the vaccine.
[00:18:52.594 --> 00:18:54.476]  So these are clear and present danger.
[00:18:55.117 --> 00:18:59.981]  We've even found people with antibodies in Yunnan to SARS-related coronaviruses.
[00:19:00.001 --> 00:19:01.342]  So there's human exposure.
[00:19:01.362 --> 00:19:01.762]  Right.
[00:19:02.203 --> 00:19:04.564]  We're now doing surveillance.
[00:19:04.845 --> 00:19:14.532]  We're just beginning another five years of work to look at cohorts in southern China to say, well, how frequent does this spillover happen and is it associated with disease?
[00:19:14.632 --> 00:19:23.159]  Because I expect, just like Nipah in Bangladesh, there are dozens and dozens of small spillovers going on on the planet any one time.
[00:19:23.539 --> 00:19:24.559]  Which we just never see.
[00:19:24.679 --> 00:19:24.900]  Sure.
[00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:26.500]  Yeah, they never amplify.
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:31.582]  There are a few cases and they're just absorbed in the illness, the overall illness of the population, right?
[00:19:31.642 --> 00:19:33.183]  Now you could say, so who cares?
[00:19:33.223 --> 00:19:38.045]  You know, and that's one argument, but our strategy is any one of those could become pandemic.
[00:19:38.065 --> 00:19:40.405]  There's a lot of stochasticity in what happens then.
[00:19:40.646 --> 00:19:40.846]  Yeah.
[00:19:40.906 --> 00:19:46.928]  So if we look at all of them, understand patterns, try and reduce the number of spillover events we've got, you know.
[00:19:48.185 --> 00:19:56.111]  But if you're saying these are diverse coronaviruses and you can't vaccinate against them, they're no antivirals, what do we do?
[00:19:56.231 --> 00:19:59.133]  Well, I think that coronaviruses are pretty good.
[00:19:59.433 --> 00:20:04.416]  I mean, you're a virologist, you know all this stuff, but you can manipulate them in the lab pretty easily.
[00:20:04.496 --> 00:20:08.199]  It's just spike protein drives a lot of what happens with the coronavirus.
[00:20:08.598 --> 00:20:14.878]   zoonotic risk. So you can get the sequence, you can build the protein, and we work with Ralph Baric at UNC to do this,
[00:20:14.878 --> 00:20:22.357]   insert it into the backbone of another virus, and do some work in the lab. So you can get more
[00:20:22.357 --> 00:20:25.198]   predictive when you find a sequence. You've got this diversity.
[00:20:25.198 --> 00:20:30.398]   Now, the logical progression for vaccines is if you're going to
[00:20:30.398 --> 00:20:34.278]   develop a vaccine for SARS, people are going to use
[00:20:34.278 --> 00:20:40.878]   pandemic SARS, but let's try and insert some of these other related and get a better vaccine.
[00:20:40.973 --> 00:20:42.634]  And I guess also knowledge of what's there.
[00:20:43.334 --> 00:20:48.057]  If you see something emerging, give it a head start on making a vaccine or a therapeutic.
[00:20:48.177 --> 00:20:48.698]  That's true.
[00:20:48.818 --> 00:20:56.643]  And, you know, better knowledge of where they are as well, so you can put your money into the clinics that matter.
[00:20:59.068 --> 00:21:06.718]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, so you add those three clips together and all the documents, the admissions, you could convict him with any jury in the United States, in Europe.
[00:21:07.218 --> 00:21:08.660]  They would all be sent to prison for life.
[00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:09.481]  You understand.
[00:21:09.882 --> 00:21:11.424]  There he is when it's already been released.
[00:21:11.484 --> 00:21:12.204]  It's already out.
[00:21:13.066 --> 00:21:14.207]  There he is in December of 2019.
[00:21:17.412 --> 00:21:21.654]  Saying, oh, these things are going to come out of caves and make us real sick.
[00:21:22.394 --> 00:21:24.475]  So we're going to make vaccines to counter it.
[00:21:24.656 --> 00:21:28.017]  Oh, but we're actually manipulating and putting the viruses together to do that.
[00:21:28.557 --> 00:21:29.538]  Then they went to the Pentagon.
[00:21:29.598 --> 00:21:35.801]  We now know years before that, two years before it, and said, we want to release this aerosolized to infect bats.
[00:21:37.142 --> 00:21:38.342]  And it can also infect humans.
[00:21:38.382 --> 00:21:39.443]  And they said, you're insane.
[00:21:40.305 --> 00:21:42.828]  So they were looking for the cover story all over the news then.
[00:21:43.088 --> 00:21:44.409]  Oh, it's gonna come out of a cave!
[00:21:44.449 --> 00:21:45.290]  A new SARS!
[00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:46.691]  It's gonna kill everybody!
[00:21:46.792 --> 00:21:47.612]  Oh, disease X!
[00:21:48.653 --> 00:21:49.574]  And they were making it.
[00:21:50.976 --> 00:21:55.700]  Wuhan scientists plan to release coronavirus particles into cave bats, which will then spread to local humans.
[00:21:56.041 --> 00:21:57.382]  Leaked papers reveal.
[00:21:58.944 --> 00:22:00.926]  And they had skin-penetrating nanoparticles.
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:06.061]  And what did I say when this Peter Daszak video got discovered a year ago?
[00:22:06.281 --> 00:22:11.043]  I said, this is them making it, this is them doing it, and I showed you documents that are making it the Wuhan lab.
[00:22:11.263 --> 00:22:16.064]  But now we have them wanting to release it open air, which we know they did, and then claimed it was a leak from the lab.
[00:22:16.204 --> 00:22:17.945]  They had it prepared, the hysteria, the fear.
[00:22:18.125 --> 00:22:19.105]  And I have more proof right here.
[00:22:20.286 --> 00:22:21.246]  Oh, I've got more proof here.
[00:22:21.286 --> 00:22:22.826]  It's up on InfoWars.com now.
[00:22:23.186 --> 00:22:33.407]   Turns out the Chinese Had already ordered masses of PCR tests two months before COVID supposedly was ever released, and we're stocking up.
[00:22:33.608 --> 00:22:43.394]  Hell, it's in the emails of Peter Daszak, where Fauci says, prepare the vaccine sequences for the viruses you've made, including the one described as COVID-19.
[00:22:44.755 --> 00:22:46.396]  That is in December as well.
[00:22:47.177 --> 00:22:51.620]  And they just finished Event 201, which is a drill of a SARS-CoV-2 virus being released.
[00:22:53.541 --> 00:22:54.382]  There it is out of Newsweek.
[00:22:56.118 --> 00:23:01.883]  So they think we're dumb, they sit out there and cover their ass by saying it on TV, like the New Yorker Magazine reporter.
[00:23:02.924 --> 00:23:14.854]  Oh, why don't we just, you know, print this up for SARS is gonna be released, COVID, and just put a patch on somebody, you know, that's printed up out of a computer, a new digital, a new digital vaccine.
[00:23:14.954 --> 00:23:16.015]  Oh, like the mRNA?
[00:23:18.017 --> 00:23:20.899]  And there it all is, in your face with three clips.
[00:23:21.099 --> 00:23:27.556]   And I can go on for hours with all these documents, and that's why They are battling to get us off the air.
[00:23:27.596 --> 00:23:29.376]  They are threatening me.
[00:23:29.416 --> 00:23:34.138]  They have sent a shot across our bow, arresting Owen Schroer, who was just at the Capitol outside peacefully.
[00:23:35.978 --> 00:23:38.139]  And I'm just telling you, folks, I can't be part of mass murder.
[00:23:38.199 --> 00:23:39.179]  I can't be part of this evil.
[00:23:39.219 --> 00:23:41.060]  I can't be part of crimes against humanity.
[00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:44.061]  And I'm against those that are going to be in Nuremberg, too.
[00:23:44.101 --> 00:23:45.001]  And I believe in humanity.
[00:23:45.241 --> 00:23:46.421]  And I believe they'll be brought to justice.
[00:23:46.461 --> 00:23:47.122]  They've been caught.
[00:23:47.522 --> 00:23:48.422]  They thought they wouldn't.
[00:23:48.662 --> 00:23:50.062]  But do we have the strength now to deal with it?
[00:23:50.122 --> 00:23:53.063]  Only Rand Paul has really taken them head on with the facts.
[00:23:53.123 --> 00:23:55.124]  And he's just saying how they lied about gain of function.
[00:23:56.701 --> 00:24:02.626]  Fauci in the last 10 years has run several conferences called In Defense of Gain of Function, or Gain of Function Conference.
[00:24:02.786 --> 00:24:04.107]  They're on C-SPAN!
[00:24:05.228 --> 00:24:09.652]  I could play you hundreds of hours of this crap, but I just showed you the smoking guns.
[00:24:10.252 --> 00:24:18.339]  Oh, if we just could blow the system up and bring out these new digital vaccines with a virus like SARS, COVID, out of China.
[00:24:20.521 --> 00:24:25.365]  Mad scientist, on parade, at a press conference, telling you what they're going to do.
[00:24:26.499 --> 00:24:30.941]  And Fauci, around all his scientists that are his cohorts, Trump will be challenged by a new outbreak.
[00:24:30.961 --> 00:24:31.401]  You watch.
[00:24:32.522 --> 00:24:33.002]  It's coming.
[00:24:33.822 --> 00:24:37.884]  So this is all hiding in plain view so they can bully and control all of us.
[00:24:38.885 --> 00:24:45.288]  While what they did is, again, an open conspiracy by the left, by the mad scientists, by the godless, by those that want to play God.
[00:24:46.269 --> 00:24:49.192]  Student records teacher shaming selfish unvaccinated students.
[00:24:49.492 --> 00:24:50.453]  You're killing people.
[00:24:50.753 --> 00:25:01.384]  No, Fauci and others that cooked this up and released it and the Pentagon's own reports admit the vaccines aren't vaccines and they erase people's immune system and are causing massive autoimmune responses.
[00:25:03.715 --> 00:25:04.856]  And that's the rest of the story.
[00:25:05.136 --> 00:25:07.058]  They didn't just do this to roll out their new vaccines.
[00:25:07.098 --> 00:25:18.867]  They did it to roll out their global dictatorship and start killing people because that's something that Peter Daszak and Bill Gates and Fauci all admit is that they're part of eugenics clubs with the richest people in the world that want depopulation.
[00:25:20.829 --> 00:25:27.234]  So this is all about breaking your will, teaching you you're dirty, teaching you you're bad, having you wear a face diaper that gives you bacterial pneumonia.
[00:25:28.439 --> 00:25:34.117]  The racial division to make us fight with each other, the medical tyranny, the fear, the phobia, the hysteria.
[00:25:34.377 --> 00:25:35.942]  This is psychological warfare.
[00:25:37.315 --> 00:25:43.638]  And I've showed you all the facts, and it's only going to get worse until we realize that this must be stopped.
[00:25:44.058 --> 00:25:50.661]  In New Zealand, they tried to bring in total martial law and said if there's ever one case, there'll be martial law nationwide.
[00:25:50.921 --> 00:25:57.844]  But people then pointed out the PCR test they use are 94% fake at the regular setting, and that it's all a power grab fraud.
[00:25:58.144 --> 00:26:01.346]  So now New Zealand abandons controversial zero-COVID policy.
[00:26:02.108 --> 00:26:05.371]  They just declared the common cold illegal, because that's what shows up in the test.
[00:26:05.571 --> 00:26:17.680]  But they did release a real COVID virus in the wild, and now they've released these synthetic spike protein simulants that we know the Pentagon was not sold on in 2017.
[00:26:18.061 --> 00:26:28.249]  And that's why General Flynn and others, without releasing classified information, have been saying this is nano-synthetic stuff they're spraying out on Florida and Texas and other areas.
[00:26:29.383 --> 00:26:36.465]  Because they'd approached the Pentagon about these weapons then, and we're going to use the cover story as, oh, we're just going to infect bats with this.
[00:26:38.006 --> 00:26:40.326]  Because the really big money is in biological weapons.
[00:26:41.026 --> 00:26:45.528]  So, man, I mean, this is just a crazy James Bond villain-style takeover.
[00:26:45.968 --> 00:26:47.148]  It is absolutely insane.
[00:26:47.188 --> 00:26:48.429]  It's all for the Great Reset.
[00:26:48.769 --> 00:26:51.169]  In their own words, Klaus Schwab, head of the U.N.
[00:26:51.209 --> 00:26:56.131]  program, now head of the Davos Group, founder of the Davos Group, former head of the Bilderberg Group, to bring in this tyranny.
[00:26:57.125 --> 00:27:00.548]  And that's what the Davos Group is, the public arm of the Bilderberg Group.
[00:27:01.469 --> 00:27:07.674]  And these people want to depopulate you, and they want to normalize death, and they say new deadly variants are coming, so you're going to be dying from those.
[00:27:07.694 --> 00:27:12.539]  No, you're going to be dying from the vaccine shedding and from the vaccinated, because it's not a vaccine.
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:17.523]  Now, you have this information now.
[00:27:17.563 --> 00:27:21.126]  You have them bragging in your face about what they've done.
[00:27:22.067 --> 00:27:23.969]  We now have the Pentagon reports.
[00:27:26.084 --> 00:27:32.768]  Where they are confirming, and I'm going to show you those, that the majority of people in hospitals have been vaccinated.
[00:27:33.429 --> 00:27:35.210]  The majority dying have been vaccinated.
[00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:39.173]  And that it removes your normal immune system and gives you a serious syndrome.
[00:27:39.513 --> 00:27:40.434]  Let's look at these headlines.
[00:27:41.574 --> 00:27:41.975]  Video.
[00:27:42.015 --> 00:27:47.058]  Fauci says people have to quote, give up what you consider your individual right of making your own decisions.
[00:27:47.138 --> 00:27:47.719]  That's a quote.
[00:27:47.759 --> 00:27:49.660]  That's total what a cult tells you.
[00:27:51.377 --> 00:27:54.138]  DoD Doc Proves COVID Vaccine Not Safe or Effective.
[00:27:54.778 --> 00:27:56.799]  Had a top lawyer on today with the documents.
[00:27:56.839 --> 00:27:58.700]  It's on the Defense Department's own website.
[00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:00.460]  Proving it all.
[00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:10.023]  Breaking AI-Powered DoD Data Analysis Program Shatters Official Vaccine Narrative Shows ADE Accelerating and Fully Vaccinated Each Week.
[00:28:10.964 --> 00:28:13.925]  And that causes death in many of the cases.
[00:28:14.978 --> 00:28:16.038]  As you see, they're vaccinated.
[00:28:16.058 --> 00:28:17.038]  The death rate goes up.
[00:28:17.518 --> 00:28:18.399]  Same curve everywhere.
[00:28:19.099 --> 00:28:19.959]  Bigger than last year.
[00:28:20.579 --> 00:28:22.299]  And it attacks Hispanics and blacks more.
[00:28:22.579 --> 00:28:23.299]  Isn't that interesting?
[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:25.240]  Because of the receptor sites on their cells.
[00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:27.720]  And it's got it all right here.
[00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:29.961]  All the numbers for you.
[00:28:30.081 --> 00:28:30.601]  All the facts.
[00:28:30.641 --> 00:28:31.301]  The conclusion.
[00:28:32.161 --> 00:28:33.141]  This is ADE.
[00:28:33.621 --> 00:28:35.061]  Antibody Dependent Enhancement.
[00:28:35.281 --> 00:28:36.122]  You don't know what that is?
[00:28:36.442 --> 00:28:38.502]  You better learn and you better learn fast.
[00:28:39.402 --> 00:28:39.942]  ADE.
[00:28:40.102 --> 00:28:41.923]  Antibody Dependent Enhancement.
[00:28:42.443 --> 00:28:43.423]  Is what the conclusion is.
[00:28:43.483 --> 00:29:00.976]   And it removes The immune systems of 5.6 million people that the DoD looked at in the Medicare Medicaid database and that the majority of hospitalizations and deaths are those that have taken the shots and that comparatively you're much more likely to if you have and you're getting sicker.
[00:29:00.996 --> 00:29:02.477]  I mean this is this is genocide.
[00:29:02.497 --> 00:29:03.437]  This is getting rid of the old people.
[00:29:05.938 --> 00:29:10.940]  And the young people are having massive heart attacks and problems which they now admit we first told you about and predicted before it ever happened.
[00:29:11.732 --> 00:29:12.092]  Look at this.
[00:29:12.152 --> 00:29:16.133]  China placed massive order for PCR tests months before first official COVID test.
[00:29:16.873 --> 00:29:20.054]  Canadian province issues new COVID rules that let government seize property.
[00:29:20.074 --> 00:29:24.055]  They're also passing this stuff in Colorado, New York, and many other areas.
[00:29:24.075 --> 00:29:25.916]  I mean, it's just a total excuse for martial law.
[00:29:26.216 --> 00:29:28.816]  Here's the province of Saskatchewan where they're doing it.
[00:29:29.676 --> 00:29:31.137]  And this all started September 1st.
[00:29:33.871 --> 00:29:40.580]  Man, I tell you folks, this is so life and death and I'm risking my life to bring this to you because we're not going to have a future if they keep succeeding anyways.
[00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:44.325]  So I'm doing this as a self-serving person for myself and my family.
[00:29:44.505 --> 00:29:46.267]  This is a societal level collapse.
[00:29:46.588 --> 00:29:47.769]  They call it the Great Reset.
[00:29:48.390 --> 00:29:49.592]  This is their global domination.
[00:29:49.652 --> 00:29:50.133]  This is it.
[00:29:50.173 --> 00:29:50.954]  This is modern war.
[00:29:52.432 --> 00:30:03.361]  And I'm begging you for your own safety and your own future and your own security to take this feed tonight and to share it once it's archived at man.video and freeworldnews.tv and to share it like your life depends on it because it does.
[00:30:04.402 --> 00:30:04.702]  All right.
[00:30:04.862 --> 00:30:05.623]  The crew's been here.
[00:30:05.683 --> 00:30:06.384]  It's late at night.
[00:30:06.484 --> 00:30:07.445]  I want everybody to share this.
[00:30:07.605 --> 00:30:09.747]  Lord willing, I'll be back tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[00:30:09.767 --> 00:30:12.329]  Central, for the Tuesday show at Harrison Smith, 8 a.m.
[00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:14.791]  But I'm just telling you.
[00:30:16.408 --> 00:30:21.372]  When the enemy does things behind the scenes and launches attacks against us, you only see a small percentage on the news.
[00:30:21.832 --> 00:30:24.254]  If we talk about what's going on, that gives them targeting.
[00:30:24.995 --> 00:30:30.179]  So I can't tell you the levels of attack we're under, but I can tell you right now, you better share the Bandai video articles and videos.
[00:30:30.539 --> 00:30:34.382]  You better support us if you want to see us on the air in the future.
[00:30:34.402 --> 00:30:37.425]  We need a major war chest to do some innovations.
[00:30:38.985 --> 00:30:44.206]  That'll ensure, unless they do a total internet kill switch, that we're going to continue to be on the air as long as possible.
[00:30:44.547 --> 00:30:46.027]  Because now's when people are waking up.
[00:30:46.047 --> 00:30:47.647]  Now's when the evil's coming out in the open.
[00:30:48.288 --> 00:30:51.328]  And so I need to stay on air as long as possible.
[00:30:52.189 --> 00:30:55.750]  I'm staying at my station, so is this crew, during very serious times.
[00:30:55.810 --> 00:30:56.230]  Believe me.
[00:30:57.670 --> 00:31:00.431]  If I was a selfish person, I would have already got out of Dodge, okay?
[00:31:01.496 --> 00:31:04.558]  That was an oxymoron when I said I'm doing this because I'm selfish.
[00:31:04.618 --> 00:31:07.560]  I mean, of course I'm doing it because I want to save humanity and myself.
[00:31:08.041 --> 00:31:13.004]  But if I was really, really super selfish, I'd be out of here and I'd be betting against humanity.
[00:31:13.024 --> 00:31:14.185]  But I'm betting on humanity.
[00:31:15.071 --> 00:31:18.535]  So, the only course is doing the right thing and trusting in God.
[00:31:19.496 --> 00:31:27.005]  And at the end of the day, it is a self-preservation issue to stand up against this if you really realize it's not going to give you a quarter, it's not going to back down, it's not going to give up at once you're dead.
[00:31:27.025 --> 00:31:29.608]  I mean, this is the new world order.
[00:31:29.648 --> 00:31:31.671]  This isn't a Terminator with Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:31:31.691 --> 00:31:32.692]  This is the real Terminator.
[00:31:32.992 --> 00:31:34.934]  It's Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates and they mean business.
[00:31:36.912 --> 00:31:39.855]  I love this crew and I admire them the best crew and talk radio and news.
[00:31:39.895 --> 00:31:40.696]  They're just awesome.
[00:31:40.776 --> 00:31:43.578]  And you're the best audience of activists and I love you and I appreciate you.
[00:31:43.658 --> 00:31:48.103]  I hope you'll all go to infowarestore.com because who knows how long that'll be there.
[00:31:48.143 --> 00:31:52.727]  That's all under attack and buy the products and get them and get t-shirts and books and films and storable food.
[00:31:52.747 --> 00:31:53.868]  We have the highest quality out there.
[00:31:54.228 --> 00:32:01.450]  Believe me, you're going to need it.
[00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:03.291]  Believe me, this is an organized collapse.
[00:32:03.351 --> 00:32:06.511]  Believe me, they've triggered the collapse of the infrastructure.
[00:32:06.912 --> 00:32:09.072]  And let me go ahead and hit that now that hit huge news.
[00:32:09.452 --> 00:32:12.373]  You know, you'd think this was our top story right here, and it shouldn't be.
[00:32:13.433 --> 00:32:23.016]  But if you understand, there's already a global war launched with the China files and the globalist against the nationals, the Christians, the patriots through the UN.
[00:32:24.974 --> 00:32:27.857]  Then you understand that COVID-19 is the rollout of the takeover.
[00:32:27.877 --> 00:32:29.338]  Everything else is a distraction.
[00:32:29.578 --> 00:32:31.500]  So America's tied down, unable to fight.
[00:32:31.941 --> 00:32:39.548]  Supply chains broke down, supplies not coming in to the shore, while the Chai Koms take over with their collaborators here in the U.S.
[00:32:39.989 --> 00:32:47.971]   Taiwanese foreign minister warns his country is preparing For war with China, ask Australia for help.
[00:32:48.692 --> 00:32:49.492]  That's what's going on.
[00:32:49.712 --> 00:32:51.854]  Hundreds of flights over Taiwan.
[00:32:52.735 --> 00:32:54.656]  Aircraft carriers off the shore.
[00:32:54.776 --> 00:32:56.678]  China mounts largest incursion yet.
[00:32:57.118 --> 00:32:58.600]  Taiwan blames US for tensions.
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:00.801]  As warplanes scramble, Beijing.
[00:33:01.782 --> 00:33:04.224]  A paper calls Taiwan's government an evil force.
[00:33:04.845 --> 00:33:05.926]  The mainland must crush.
[00:33:07.467 --> 00:33:12.231]  Raising China's steadily ramps up warplane flights in Taiwan airspace.
[00:33:13.462 --> 00:33:16.165]  Russia test fires submarine-launched hypersonic missile.
[00:33:17.286 --> 00:33:21.951]  It goes on and on and on while the borders are broken, while the globalists assault everything.
[00:33:23.693 --> 00:33:24.914]  And now you see this.
[00:33:25.335 --> 00:33:28.638]  You want my take on what's happening with Facebook?
[00:33:28.878 --> 00:33:29.559]  I don't know yet.
[00:33:29.679 --> 00:33:31.681]  And so I'm not like other people that just make stuff up.
[00:33:32.142 --> 00:33:35.886]  But I'll tell you this, I know what different possibilities there are.
[00:33:37.298 --> 00:33:46.028]  Yeah, this new big whistleblower comes out who calls for more censorship, more control, says, oh, Facebook allowed January 6th and Americans to talk.
[00:33:46.368 --> 00:33:47.530]  It's a right-wing evil thing.
[00:33:47.730 --> 00:33:54.217]  There's a consortium of globalists that want full control of Facebook and don't like who's in control of it now to make it even worse.
[00:33:55.089 --> 00:33:56.531]  Okay, the outage.
[00:33:56.852 --> 00:33:58.074]  They say the Chinese attack.
[00:33:58.114 --> 00:34:14.516]   Yeah, that's going on and the Chinese work with that consortium that doesn't even even though Zuckerberg said I want to name my daughter after you GG ping and he said no, there's a lot of double dealing and in fighting and You know, the globalists, the Chinese are not 100% simpatico.
[00:34:15.077 --> 00:34:18.899]  And so a lot of the people the Chinese thought were their agents, they now are double agents.
[00:34:18.959 --> 00:34:28.746]  So this is ranksmanship between China and different globalist forces, in my view, and a way to then hold Facebook hostage to go more to the QICOM control system.
[00:34:28.766 --> 00:34:36.011]  I think Xi Jinping saw through, oh, let me name my daughter after you, as a way for them to get closer into China.
[00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:41.980]  He saw how they banned Trump off there, so that's why Xi Jinping has stepped away from big tech.
[00:34:42.622 --> 00:34:43.784]  Even Merkel said they shouldn't do it.
[00:34:43.805 --> 00:34:47.092]  So even these dictators, and Merkel was a dictator too, she stole elections for 14 years.
[00:34:49.665 --> 00:34:57.308]  That's probably what's going on, but it's not 100%, but that's the main confluence and background and sides and things I see going on, the direction it came from.
[00:34:58.068 --> 00:34:59.929]  The whistleblower is all part of an attack on that as well.
[00:34:59.949 --> 00:35:02.290]  I'm not defending Facebook, that's just my analysis of this.
[00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:03.450]  Let's continue.
[00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:04.571]  Facebook is alive.
[00:35:04.611 --> 00:35:07.632]  DNS issues being resolved after six hours of darkness.
[00:35:07.972 --> 00:35:10.713]  What is the big takeaway that we know from this?
[00:35:11.453 --> 00:35:13.114]  Facebook offices all over the world.
[00:35:13.914 --> 00:35:14.975]  They're in more than 20 countries.
[00:35:15.848 --> 00:35:18.049]  They have one system that controls getting in and out of the buildings.
[00:35:18.089 --> 00:35:19.870]  That all failed, supposedly as backups.
[00:35:20.311 --> 00:35:25.974]  So if they were locked out, it shows how because you have central controllers, somebody can hack in, they can take control.
[00:35:26.194 --> 00:35:28.796]  Why would you want all the airplanes flown by machines or the cars?
[00:35:29.156 --> 00:35:39.122]  That would allow AI to go crazy and kill everybody, or a bad government to do it, or a crazy person to do it, or a satellite knocked out because of solar flares and communications and everything goes down.
[00:35:39.502 --> 00:35:52.247]  And then your nuclear reactors aren't run by humans that know how to do it anymore because they've been so busy like pilots letting the auto control do it that once there's a crisis, they're too lazy and dumb to fix it because they're like people lounging on the cruise ship in Wally.
[00:35:54.367 --> 00:35:54.808]  There's that.
[00:35:55.928 --> 00:35:59.449]  Facebook employees badge not allowing them in buildings amid outage.
[00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:03.931]  See, this is a prison cage we've built for ourselves.
[00:36:03.971 --> 00:36:06.472]  We need decentralization, individual control.
[00:36:09.221 --> 00:36:18.023]  Web scrapers claim to possess and sell personal data of 1.5 million Facebook users on a hacker forum.
[00:36:19.083 --> 00:36:20.123]  And it goes on from there.
[00:36:20.624 --> 00:36:22.984]  Facebook's weaker than you know, mainstream media tells us.
[00:36:23.044 --> 00:36:28.725]  Yes, even more rabid globalist forces can take it over because there's always infighting inside any criminal combine.
[00:36:29.145 --> 00:36:31.486]  Facebook CTO apologizes for the outages.
[00:36:33.359 --> 00:36:35.582]  Now they've had a $60 million or whatever it is sell off.
[00:36:36.223 --> 00:36:40.348]  So that's our emergency Monday night transmission.
[00:36:40.648 --> 00:36:43.231]  I told you every day is precious right now.
[00:36:44.132 --> 00:36:48.278]  This is all them getting you ready just overall with these different sides hacking each other.
[00:36:49.824 --> 00:36:58.810]  With Klaus Schwab writing books and the globalists saying the next big thing is a cyber outage worldwide that'll make COVID-19 look like an irritant compared to a collapse.
[00:36:59.190 --> 00:37:02.950]   And they'll use that also to bring in their new global reset of currencies and say all
[00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:06.190]   the other currencies are dead, getting them out of trouble for devaluation, all their
[00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:07.190]  Ponzi schemes.
[00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:12.230]   They'll have a new global currency based on the UN, based on your medical ID, based on
[00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:13.230]  your vaccine.
[00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:14.869]  So now you quote, "Got to have it."
[00:37:14.869 --> 00:37:16.548]  And then that'll also be tied to carbon taxes.
[00:37:16.548 --> 00:37:17.548]  They've said all this.
[00:37:17.548 --> 00:37:20.889]   So again, they're just getting you ready for this and saying it's all coming so they can
[00:37:20.889 --> 00:37:26.789]   manipulate both sides to consolidate power and control using the outages they create
[00:37:26.789 --> 00:37:33.269]   to create even stronger, more controlled centralized systems that they are in the dominant position
[00:37:33.269 --> 00:37:34.269]  with.
[00:37:34.269 --> 00:37:38.990]   And again, that's why we're on air preparing you, getting you ready, saying you should
[00:37:39.809 --> 00:37:42.630]  This is everything I told you about coming for decades, it's here.
[00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:46.152]  And I know God put me here, God put you where you are for this time.
[00:37:46.172 --> 00:37:49.974]  So I'm telling you, your email list, your text messages, that's where they're having trouble censoring.
[00:37:50.274 --> 00:37:54.657]  Take this feed, take this article, take this video, take the link on InfoWars and share it.
[00:37:55.017 --> 00:37:59.262]  And then go on Facebook and Twitter and YouTube and all of it and say, look, it's happening.
[00:37:59.522 --> 00:38:00.663]  Here's the smoking gun.
[00:38:01.084 --> 00:38:02.165]  Let's blow up the system.
[00:38:02.345 --> 00:38:03.586]  Let's have a virus released.
[00:38:03.807 --> 00:38:06.630]  So all these high tech vaccines should come in and get rid of the other ones.
[00:38:07.070 --> 00:38:10.714]  And then you learn the next domino is depopulation, medical ID, total control.
[00:38:11.475 --> 00:38:13.237]  Think about the information you saw here.
[00:38:15.342 --> 00:38:17.584]  Take this and edit it down to two minutes for Twitter.
[00:38:17.644 --> 00:38:19.185]  Take it and edit it down to YouTube for ten minutes.
[00:38:19.205 --> 00:38:20.506]  None of this is copyright.
[00:38:20.546 --> 00:38:21.446]  We're free to air.
[00:38:21.686 --> 00:38:22.107]  Use this.
[00:38:22.187 --> 00:38:22.687]  Get it out.
[00:38:23.087 --> 00:38:25.269]  Pay to put it on your local TV station.
[00:38:25.429 --> 00:38:26.830]  You can buy time on local stations.
[00:38:27.350 --> 00:38:28.051]  Download this.
[00:38:28.331 --> 00:38:29.351]  Here I am saying free to air.
[00:38:29.371 --> 00:38:30.192]  Everybody can use this.
[00:38:30.652 --> 00:38:32.734]  Play it on your local TV station or radio station.
[00:38:33.194 --> 00:38:34.154]  Don't play games.
[00:38:34.174 --> 00:38:35.375]  You don't know who's going to hear.
[00:38:35.615 --> 00:38:38.976]  You don't know that one person that's going to wake up that's the domino that brings them down.
[00:38:39.176 --> 00:38:45.657]  I've been on there 28 years and I've met incredible people from average folks to super famous billionaires who say I changed their whole life.
[00:38:45.877 --> 00:38:48.078]  Well, that was you spreading the word that changed their lives.
[00:38:48.878 --> 00:38:52.579]  I didn't even know that part of a large part of King of the Hill is based on me.
[00:38:53.179 --> 00:38:54.499]  My judge told me that in person.
[00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:55.300]  People didn't believe it.
[00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:56.360]  He did an interview and said it.
[00:38:56.980 --> 00:38:58.080]  I was on AXS TV in 95, 96 when he wrote that.
[00:39:02.108 --> 00:39:03.709]  That's just a microcosm example.
[00:39:04.149 --> 00:39:05.730]  We're a big influence on idiocracy.
[00:39:06.411 --> 00:39:10.613]  But I could go on for just, you know, Captain America, Winter Soldier.
[00:39:10.893 --> 00:39:11.954]  Talk to the writers.
[00:39:11.974 --> 00:39:13.815]  They based a bunch of that on my false flags.
[00:39:14.115 --> 00:39:15.616]  You don't know what you can do.
[00:39:16.036 --> 00:39:17.997]  You don't know how you're influencing the world.
[00:39:18.057 --> 00:39:20.359]  You don't know the ripples in the ponds that cause.
[00:39:20.979 --> 00:39:26.342]  How this broadcast woke up Tucker Carlson to a greater level, and Joe Rogan, and countless others.
[00:39:26.382 --> 00:39:27.763]  That's you supporting us.
[00:39:27.983 --> 00:39:30.885]  And that's why they want us off air, because we were born for this time.
[00:39:31.672 --> 00:39:35.911]   to surf this globalist wave into victory. So we're here using this to wake people up,
[00:39:35.911 --> 00:39:39.672]   not them using it for global domination and slaughter. A lot of folks have already been
[00:39:39.672 --> 00:39:43.831]   killed. A lot more are going to die. But we're going to try to stop the giant numbers they're
[00:39:43.831 --> 00:39:47.590]   planning that are even bigger and turn this around and have a new renaissance.
[00:39:47.590 --> 00:39:52.072]   Or I'm going to die trying because I can't join these people and lose my soul.
[00:39:52.261 --> 00:39:53.382]  This is an incredible time.
[00:39:53.502 --> 00:39:54.903]  Thank you all for what you've been doing.
[00:39:55.244 --> 00:39:56.485]  Thank you all for standing with us.
[00:39:57.025 --> 00:39:59.187]  And just like I said, spread this damn link now!
[00:40:00.188 --> 00:40:10.459]  And go to Infowarshore.com while you still can and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt, get some of the supplements, because we need funds, we need war chest to do a lot of exciting things you don't know about yet.
[00:40:10.479 --> 00:40:12.361]  And I'll just leave it at that for strategic reasons.
[00:40:12.961 --> 00:40:15.522]  Infowars Emergency Supply Chain Breakdown Sale.
[00:40:15.923 --> 00:40:19.564]  I launched that this morning before Facebook went out.
[00:40:19.624 --> 00:40:21.025]  That was launched at 9 a.m.
[00:40:21.065 --> 00:40:21.425]  this morning.
[00:40:21.485 --> 00:40:25.067]  I walked in over there in the office and I said, change the sale to this.
[00:40:26.728 --> 00:40:31.230]  And I came on air and said, it'll be your last chance to get this for an hour and a half before the outage began.
[00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:32.711]  Because I can see it!
[00:40:33.953 --> 00:40:34.794]  You can feel it!
[00:40:35.195 --> 00:40:38.080]  And then you learn the enemy has already all said it.
[00:40:38.381 --> 00:40:39.342]  Alright, great job the crew.
[00:40:39.382 --> 00:40:39.903]  God bless you.
[00:40:40.083 --> 00:40:42.007]  Now it's up to the viewers and listeners to take this and get it out.
[00:40:42.307 --> 00:40:45.372]  If you don't, remember God's watching.
[00:40:45.472 --> 00:40:59.311]  God bless.
[00:40:59.304 --> 00:41:00.305]  I loved my job.
[00:41:00.426 --> 00:41:01.286]  I loved the people.
[00:41:02.347 --> 00:41:10.215]  And I physically seen people restraining the elderly and vaccinating against their will while they scream no.
[00:41:11.036 --> 00:41:14.039]  I seen patients coming in with suicide.
[00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:17.803]  And they are testing them after they're dead.
[00:41:18.163 --> 00:41:20.987]  Once they're dead, they're testing them for COVID.
[00:41:21.187 --> 00:41:21.487]  Why?
[00:41:21.907 --> 00:41:23.409]  Why are we testing them for COVID?
[00:41:23.549 --> 00:41:28.114]  I've witnessed a lot of people dying of heart attacks shortly after the vaccine.
[00:41:28.835 --> 00:41:35.442]  I've witnessed miscarriages at full term, five days, four days after vaccine.
[00:41:37.284 --> 00:41:41.286]  And that's just a little town, a little community.
[00:41:41.346 --> 00:41:45.489]  Because I'm in a little hospital, a small hospital, and I worked on every floor.
[00:41:45.589 --> 00:41:51.173]  I worked in long-term general care, eMERGE, external clinic, I saw it all.
[00:41:51.553 --> 00:41:52.814]  What's the size of the community?
[00:41:53.755 --> 00:41:53.995]  About 3,000.
[00:41:54.215 --> 00:41:55.976]  It's a Pontiac area.
[00:41:57.177 --> 00:41:59.478]  And I have nothing to lose.
[00:41:59.498 --> 00:42:01.838]  I have nothing to hide.
[00:42:02.738 --> 00:42:08.319]  They wanted to mandate the vaccine on me and I refused.
[00:42:08.839 --> 00:42:11.460]  Inside the walls of this hospital we have patients.
[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:15.021]  We have vaccinated patients and unvaccinated patients.
[00:42:15.701 --> 00:42:24.782]   And the other day I had a situation where I was at the nurse's station and a nurse came out of a patient room All flustered, sat down across from me.
[00:42:25.042 --> 00:42:26.383]  She had two nurses next to her.
[00:42:26.403 --> 00:42:27.423]  They were travel nurses.
[00:42:27.923 --> 00:42:29.744]  And our charge nurse on the other side of her.
[00:42:30.525 --> 00:42:32.205]  And she just started spewing.
[00:42:34.727 --> 00:42:35.387]  These are her words.
[00:42:35.447 --> 00:42:37.008]  I'm going to repeat what she said.
[00:42:37.568 --> 00:42:39.169]  I just came out of my patient's room.
[00:42:39.729 --> 00:42:41.250]  My patient is COVID positive.
[00:42:41.590 --> 00:42:44.691]  And that motherfucker has not gotten a vaccination.
[00:42:44.992 --> 00:42:45.952]  He's unvaccinated.
[00:42:46.853 --> 00:42:49.054]  Why are we even spending time giving this guy a room?
[00:42:51.445 --> 00:42:54.407]  Who are unvaccinated, need to go home and die.
[00:42:54.868 --> 00:42:56.249]  Why are we even giving them a room?
[00:42:56.929 --> 00:43:01.753]  When they're in the ER and they show up without a vaccine, they need to just go home and die.
[00:43:02.333 --> 00:43:03.474]  Why are we taking care of them?
[00:43:03.815 --> 00:43:06.917]  Why am I spending time taking care of these?
[00:43:08.138 --> 00:43:09.999]  If you're unvaccinated, you need to go home and die.
[00:43:10.019 --> 00:43:13.422]  We are wasting our resources giving them patient rooms.
[00:43:13.442 --> 00:43:19.547]  When we have patients who are vaccinated, who are trying to take care of themselves, want to be healthy, give them the room.
[00:43:20.106 --> 00:43:26.789]  She went on and on like this, and then she said, these patients who are unvaccinated are spreading the Delta variant, and I'm so sick of them.
[00:43:26.970 --> 00:43:28.210]  We need to get rid of these people.
[00:43:29.171 --> 00:43:33.733]  And I'm sitting there, across from her, exactly, thinking, this is ugly.
[00:43:33.753 --> 00:43:34.593]  This is ugly.
[00:43:35.014 --> 00:43:35.534]  Hatred.
[00:43:36.134 --> 00:43:37.755]  She hates this patient.
[00:43:38.916 --> 00:43:39.896]  She's mean spirited.
[00:43:39.976 --> 00:43:40.937]  How do you turn that off?
[00:43:41.477 --> 00:43:43.878]  How do you turn that off when you go into your patient room?
[00:43:45.579 --> 00:43:46.099]  What's going on?
[00:43:46.319 --> 00:43:49.041]  I mean, first of all, I should have had my camera going.
[00:43:49.141 --> 00:43:53.733]   Secondly, If she finds out I'm unvaccinated, what's she going to do to me?
[00:43:53.753 --> 00:43:54.374]  Is she going to hurt me?
[00:43:55.174 --> 00:43:57.675]  And thirdly, what happened to her patient?
[00:43:57.735 --> 00:43:59.196]  Was she giving that patient any care?
[00:43:59.216 --> 00:44:00.617]  Did she just go in there?
[00:44:00.637 --> 00:44:02.257]  Did she hurt him?
[00:44:02.818 --> 00:44:04.858]  Did she pull the tape off really slow?
[00:44:04.878 --> 00:44:06.999]  I mean, what's going on in this room?
[00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:08.080]  I don't know.
[00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:12.542]  And the two travel nurses sitting next to her just, yeah, uh-huh.
[00:44:13.242 --> 00:44:13.442]  Yep.
[00:44:14.143 --> 00:44:15.223]  Totally agreeing with this.
[00:44:16.164 --> 00:44:25.144]   And I've never seen such a Hi, I'm Cristina, I'm a health worker, and I wanted to answer to Ms.
[00:44:25.164 --> 00:44:25.964]  Andrea Mandelli.
[00:44:26.004 --> 00:44:30.627]  So, you talked about the fact that intensive care units are full of unvaccinated people.
[00:44:30.467 --> 00:44:36.067]  I am a health worker and I wanted to answer to Andrea Mandelli.
[00:44:36.067 --> 00:44:42.867]   You have mentioned that intensive care units are full of unvaccinated people.
[00:44:42.867 --> 00:44:48.267]   Until today at 4pm, after I was suspended, but until 4pm I was in service,
[00:44:48.267 --> 00:44:54.867]   the people who were in intensive care for Covid were all vaccinated.
[00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:57.120]  So don't say that, because it's not true.
[00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:58.201]  What hospital?
[00:44:58.301 --> 00:44:58.981]  Absolutely, yes.
[00:44:59.061 --> 00:45:00.062]  Absolutely, yes.
[00:45:00.402 --> 00:45:02.463]  After that, they never speak clearly again.
[00:45:06.004 --> 00:45:10.026]  I'm in my 11th year of nursing and have worked for Henry Ford since 2014.
[00:45:10.427 --> 00:45:15.850]  I'm an educator on a general practice unit where we do care for COVID patients, most of which are fully vaccinated.
[00:45:16.350 --> 00:45:25.775]  The threat from my employer all started in March of 2020 when I, like many others, received an email stating that I was deployed inpatient to help during the pandemic and to care for COVID patients.
[00:45:26.576 --> 00:45:31.899]  If I did not accept, I would be suspended for three days, offered the same assignment, and if I refused, I would be fired.
[00:45:32.479 --> 00:45:36.141]  I was deployed for three months and received no COVID pay while caring for COVID patients.
[00:45:36.501 --> 00:45:42.784]  We did run out of PPE, received one surgical mask per week, and even had to wear trash bags as gowns at one point.
[00:45:43.345 --> 00:45:51.949]  In June of 2021, I received an email from Henry Ford threatening termination of employment, this time for non-compliance with their COVID vaccine mandate by September 10th.
[00:45:52.589 --> 00:45:55.773]  The hospital offered COVID listening sessions for staff to ask questions.
[00:45:56.234 --> 00:45:58.416]  I attended and I did ask questions respectfully.
[00:45:58.877 --> 00:46:05.766]  Shortly after, I was greeted by the chief nursing officer and administration stating they noticed I was at the sessions and that I seemed distressed.
[00:46:06.246 --> 00:46:08.309]  They said I needed to take a week off of work to think.
[00:46:08.829 --> 00:46:11.650]  I was told that as a leader, it is not my job to question policy.
[00:46:12.070 --> 00:46:17.573]  This was followed up with an email from the CNO stating I would be off work for the week and I needed to report to her upon my return.
[00:46:18.013 --> 00:46:26.236]  When I did return, I was pulled aside for a meeting with the CNO, HR, and leadership in the middle of my 12-hour shift with a 6-patient assignment and a nursing student.
[00:46:26.736 --> 00:46:29.858]  I was warned that I could have been fired for my questions at the listening session.
[00:46:30.278 --> 00:46:33.640]  I was warned that as a leader, I must get on board with what the system is doing.
[00:46:34.061 --> 00:46:37.443]  I was told not to answer any further questions regarding the COVID vaccine.
[00:46:37.883 --> 00:46:45.147]  I was offered help finding another job and told that if I disagree with this mandate, I should be respectful to leadership and administration and resign my position.
[00:46:45.808 --> 00:46:52.152]  Since then, I've been pulled aside almost every shift by management and asked, do you have questions about the mandate or your termination?
[00:46:52.532 --> 00:46:54.433]  How do you feel about me posting your position?
[00:46:54.893 --> 00:46:56.054]  It's constant harassment.
[00:46:56.889 --> 00:47:00.792]  All managers have been sent a list of employees on their unit who have not been vaccinated.
[00:47:00.812 --> 00:47:04.034]  These staff are now being pulled aside one by one in question.
[00:47:04.414 --> 00:47:07.837]  They are being pressured, coerced, and intimidated into receiving the vaccine.
[00:47:08.237 --> 00:47:15.402]  They are being told they won't be able to find other jobs in health care, and those in school are being told they must comply in order to receive future education.
[00:47:15.842 --> 00:47:19.444]  We have now been branded anti-vaxxers and have a scarlet letter on our chest.
[00:47:19.825 --> 00:47:21.546]  I ask you, what happened to HIPAA?
[00:47:22.106 --> 00:47:23.847]  Is medical segregation okay?
[00:47:24.427 --> 00:47:28.686]   Henry Ford is flooding the hospitals now there are a bunch of sick people in the
[00:47:28.686 --> 00:47:31.686]   hospital because of the Delta variant so a very specific question in your
[00:47:31.686 --> 00:47:36.446]   hospital is there a test for the Delta variant? Absolutely not and in fact
[00:47:36.446 --> 00:47:40.847]   there is no word or mention of the word Delta variant in any note from any
[00:47:40.847 --> 00:47:47.087]   doctor from any outside office feeding in specialist urgent care emergency room
[00:47:47.456 --> 00:47:51.179]  I have not seen that word, the word Delta Variant in any chart.
[00:47:51.479 --> 00:48:01.347]  The only place I have seen the word Delta Variant is in the letters going out from the hospital administration to the staff quoting reasons why they should get the vaccinations.
[00:48:02.386 --> 00:48:05.211]  But no patient has been diagnosed with the Delta variant?
[00:48:06.373 --> 00:48:06.574]  No.
[00:48:06.894 --> 00:48:07.235]  None?
[00:48:07.295 --> 00:48:08.056]  COVID-19.
[00:48:08.657 --> 00:48:11.623]  Okay, so have you seen an influx of patients recently?
[00:48:13.021 --> 00:48:13.962]  No, not, not, no.
[00:48:14.162 --> 00:48:32.943]  The most influx I have seen is since the vaccination rollout and it's more vaccination related injuries, blood clots, cardiac issues, neurological issues, balance issues, cognitive issues, aggressive behavior, encephalopathy, things like that, that were, that are very different from the previous COVID.
[00:48:34.247 --> 00:48:46.790]  So, the patients that are in your hospital, under your care, right now, the majority of them are in fact not COVID patients, but they are vaccine injured people?
[00:48:46.810 --> 00:48:47.850]  Yes.
[00:48:50.171 --> 00:48:50.411]  Yes.
[00:48:51.071 --> 00:48:58.593]  Do the doctors, do the providers, report these adverse events, these vaccine injuries, to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System?
[00:48:59.511 --> 00:49:01.232]  I have not seen one instance where they have.
[00:49:01.332 --> 00:49:09.515]  In fact, when staff approaches doctors about this, whether it's noticed by the staff or noticed by the patient's family, they're completely dismissed.
[00:49:09.895 --> 00:49:16.517]  The staff that's aware, because now it's kind of you can, you know, which staff is aware of what's going on or acknowledging it and which staff doesn't.
[00:49:17.077 --> 00:49:18.598]  It's almost, we almost label it.
[00:49:18.798 --> 00:49:20.739]  The Delta variant is the vaccine injuries.
[00:49:20.819 --> 00:49:22.119]  That's what, that's what it is.
[00:49:22.659 --> 00:49:24.360]  What do you want the entire world to know?
[00:49:25.876 --> 00:49:28.278]  I want the world to stop watching the news.
[00:49:28.378 --> 00:49:29.699]  It is absolutely false.
[00:49:29.759 --> 00:49:31.100]  It is creating a false fear.
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:40.348]  I would go through COVID, the actual initial part of this, 10 times over easily compared to what I have seen with this vaccine rollout.
[00:49:41.049 --> 00:49:46.013]  The injuries and the loss of life and the loss of function, people are walking... COVID, guys.
[00:49:46.053 --> 00:49:49.816]  Like, for real, we're not treating the COVID.
[00:49:52.078 --> 00:50:05.675]   We have a nurse who, like, Fell asleep at the fucking nurse's station while we were all in rooms, and her norepinephrine ran out, and the guy had no fucking blood pressure, and didn't perfuse his brain, and I'm pretty sure his brain did.
[00:50:07.295 --> 00:50:13.397]  That same nurse is now running a CRRT machine, a dialysis-like machine, that she has never done before.
[00:50:13.517 --> 00:50:15.017]  She said she'll figure it out.
[00:50:15.898 --> 00:50:16.278]  Okay?
[00:50:17.178 --> 00:50:24.200]  I'm pretty fucking smart, and I figure a lot of shit out, but I would never attempt to try and figure out a CRRT machine on the fly.
[00:50:25.646 --> 00:50:32.470]  There was a nurse who placed an NG tube into some guy's lungs and filled his lungs with tube feeding.
[00:50:33.671 --> 00:50:43.257]  There was a nurse who confused a long-acting insulin with a short-acting insulin and gave 30 units of a fast-acting insulin and killed the guy.
[00:50:44.978 --> 00:50:51.978]   I'm literally coming here everyday and watching them kill them.
[00:50:51.978 --> 00:50:58.978]  [Music]
[00:50:58.978 --> 00:51:04.778]   By now you've heard me talk about the BioProbes and how they're creating amazing products.
[00:51:05.069 --> 00:51:13.676]  They've done it again and have just released an entire suite of bio-remediation products, bringing industrial-level technology to the everyday consumer.
[00:51:13.996 --> 00:51:17.959]  They're literally changing the industry with a revolutionary patented delivery system.
[00:51:18.179 --> 00:51:26.526]  The BioPros are excited to release BioDrain Pro, a product specifically designed to establish healthy drains, pipes, and overall plumbing systems.
[00:51:26.986 --> 00:51:33.012]  Biodrain Pro digests grease, fats, oil, sludge, paper, and organic matter with ease.
[00:51:33.533 --> 00:51:40.420]  It contains no chemicals, no GMOs, and is safe for black and gray holding tanks, sewer hoses, and plumbing.
[00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:42.341]  It is also human and animal safe.
[00:51:42.562 --> 00:51:46.882]   Get up to 20 treatments with the scoop for easy applications.
[00:51:46.882 --> 00:51:52.161]   Say goodbye to drain problems. Gas buildup and odor guaranteed.
[00:51:52.161 --> 00:51:57.042]   Just pour and add water. It's that simple. Visit thebiopros.com and see for yourself.
[00:51:57.042 --> 00:52:04.802]   So the placebo that they have used, that the FDA has allowed them to use,
[00:52:04.802 --> 00:52:08.241]  has often been another vaccine.
[00:52:08.457 --> 00:52:13.199]  A vaccine with a known adverse reaction profile that's causing death and damage in its own right.
[00:52:14.279 --> 00:52:26.069]   That it's the Aluminum, as an adjuvant in the vaccine, a known neurotoxin, a known immunotoxin, a known poison in human beings, that is in the supposedly inert placebo.
[00:52:26.550 --> 00:52:27.951]  Totally inappropriate.
[00:52:28.011 --> 00:52:29.852]  This is not good science.
[00:52:29.892 --> 00:52:31.433]  It is not science at all.
[00:52:32.394 --> 00:52:44.324]  It is an effort to cover up the true adverse reaction rates to these vaccines so that they can get through the low barrier of constraints put there by the FDA and onto the market.
[00:52:44.404 --> 00:52:45.565]  That is the only concern.
[00:52:45.882 --> 00:52:50.167]  Dr. Wakefield is just one of many informed voices in the film, Covenantland.
