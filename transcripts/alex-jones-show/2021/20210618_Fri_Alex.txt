[00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:08.215]  They're in the news saying we're going to use counter-terrorism on the networks of Trump support and those that question elections, when that's our right to question those elections.
[00:00:08.455 --> 00:00:09.876]  And you're the ones that are terrorists.
[00:00:10.357 --> 00:00:12.158]  And you're the ones that are terrorizing people.
[00:00:12.478 --> 00:00:14.420]  And somebody's got to call your bluff.
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.603]  Or, if it's not a bluff, everybody's going to see Alex Jones get set up or killed.
[00:00:20.344 --> 00:00:22.466]  That's just the way the ball bounces.
[00:00:23.987 --> 00:00:25.548]  And I am completely comfortable with that.
[00:00:27.441 --> 00:00:29.842]  One way or the other, you're getting called out for what you've done.
[00:00:30.502 --> 00:00:35.104]  Keep pushing it, and pushing it, and pushing it, and somebody's got to stand up against your ass.
[00:00:36.684 --> 00:00:55.971]  And my main mission is to get other people to stand up in City Hall, and in police departments, and in the state houses, and in the churches, and in the businesses, and in the farms, and in the ranches, and in the factories, and in the mountains, and in the valleys, and on the ocean, and on the lakes, and the streams, and the rivers of this country.
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:04.867]  Because to quote Winston Churchill, we will go on to the end, whatever the cost may be, and we will never surrender.
[00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:10.292]  Because that's a drug better than anything I ever felt in my life, being on the side of right.
[00:01:11.124 --> 00:01:28.959]  And not bound to evil and not bound to a bunch of cowards and a bunch of scum lawyers that have been all over boardrooms hyping themselves up how tough they are and how badass they are and how they're gonna whip those Americans and teach those Midwesterners and teach those Texans and teach those people that are hard-working that they're scum and we're under your thumb!
[00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.701]  No, we're not under your thumb!
[00:01:30.901 --> 00:01:35.765]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:39.955 --> 00:01:50.838]  Back in May of 2021, Austin, Texas voted on Proposition B, which made it illegal for the growing number of homeless flocking to Austin to camp anywhere they please.
[00:01:50.978 --> 00:01:59.561]  The vote was 57% in favor and 42% against, according to the Travis County Clerk's office election data.
[00:02:04.022 --> 00:02:13.725]  People have no reasonable expectation of privacy in public spaces where their actions, content, and possessions can be seen or conversations heard.
[00:02:14.126 --> 00:02:17.807]  Again, whether the content at issue is physical or virtual.
[00:02:18.147 --> 00:02:23.869]  Examples of such places are public sidewalks, venues hosting sporting events, and public parks.
[00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:29.073]  There is no reasonable expectation of privacy in discarded garbage left in the street.
[00:02:29.373 --> 00:02:41.023]  The homeless had been promised permanent housing from the council, which never materialized, even after millions were cut from much-needed public safety and diverted towards housing the homeless.
[00:02:41.203 --> 00:02:51.712]  When the day arrived for Proposition B to be enforced, the first area targeted was City Hall, which had fallen under siege by what appeared to be the homeless, but that was an illusion.
[00:02:51.952 --> 00:03:02.026]  I had been informed by the defunded Austin Police Department that they were well aware that the people now shouting threats and racist diatribes in their faces weren't homeless.
[00:03:02.307 --> 00:03:04.170]  The majority of them were activists.
[00:03:08.035 --> 00:03:15.764]  Listen, we were being extraordinary asking for voluntary compliance to not block buildings, right?
[00:03:16.084 --> 00:03:22.391]  So listen, this endeavor is separate and distinct from saying, hey, I'm just doing education hours.
[00:03:22.431 --> 00:03:22.972]  That's a courtesy.
[00:03:23.452 --> 00:03:24.854]  This has never been legal.
[00:03:25.154 --> 00:03:34.223]  The reality is that the liberal activist group Homes Not Handcuffs had organized the siege in protest of the will of the Austin voters.
[00:03:34.583 --> 00:03:48.016]  Supporting that protest was the majority of the now absent city council and other wealthy Democrats hell-bent on turning Texas blue, again manipulating the legitimate vote and will of the Austin voters.
[00:03:48.596 --> 00:03:56.680]  And per usual, the local police would have to endure the task of playing the role of the bad guy while enforcing the people's vote.
[00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:09.746]  To make matters more undemocratic and totalitarian, the organization behind Homes Not Handcuffs is ActBlue, the insidious George Soros tax-exempt political organization
[00:04:10.006 --> 00:04:23.115]  An organization where billionaires dump money into pseudo grassroots movements designed to throw a wrench in federal, state, and local government foolish enough to allow the minions of Soros' lies to fester.
[00:04:23.535 --> 00:04:38.466]  Act Blue was once described in a human rights article as, quote, not driven by the average Democrat, as their image may suggest, they are rather mouthpieces for the radical agendas of the likes of Soros and labor unions.
[00:04:38.646 --> 00:04:46.051]  You really need to bring China into the creation of a new world order.
[00:04:46.491 --> 00:04:49.593]  George Soros has been a controversial topic.
[00:04:49.813 --> 00:04:52.675]  His past is well known and his enemies are many.
[00:04:52.835 --> 00:04:57.638]  But after the media defended his public image recently, he had fallen off the radar.
[00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:08.085]  Which gave Soros and those that would dismantle the United States enough time and cover to reinforce their radical activism infesting major U.S.
[00:05:08.145 --> 00:05:08.525]  cities.
[00:05:08.845 --> 00:05:16.450]  It became accepted common knowledge, and although it is completely antithetical to the survival of our Republic, U.S.
[00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:22.214]  politicians have done relatively nothing to stop it, and it's been ignored by media as it grew.
[00:05:27.938 --> 00:05:28.578]  We're good to go.
[00:05:55.615 --> 00:05:59.896]  George Soros and his employees have laid siege to your city hall.
[00:06:00.096 --> 00:06:01.256]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:06:02.317 --> 00:06:06.378]  And the reason this is so important is it's the same here and in Europe and around the world.
[00:06:06.738 --> 00:06:08.418]  It's all part of the larger criminal takeover.
[00:06:09.238 --> 00:06:10.839]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:13.139]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:28.672 --> 00:06:33.969]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live broadcasting worldwide on this Friday, June 18th.
[00:06:35.635 --> 00:06:36.295]  Transmission.
[00:06:37.095 --> 00:06:40.676]  We're going to be here for the next four hours.
[00:06:41.296 --> 00:06:47.637]  And then the War Room with Owen Schroeder takes over right here on the embattled InfoWars radio slash TV network.
[00:06:48.378 --> 00:06:59.420]  We also have a constitutional lawyer who represents quite a few of the victims that are being set up by the criminal deep state from the January 6th event who were not violent.
[00:07:00.387 --> 00:07:04.510]  And who are allowed into the Capitol building by the police, who are in solitary confinement.
[00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:09.253]  That lawyer will be joining us coming up at the start of the next hour.
[00:07:09.974 --> 00:07:20.721]  Max Keiser is going to pop in with an inflation update in the last segment or so of the third hour, but I also intend to open the phones up today, then tomorrow.
[00:07:21.877 --> 00:07:33.306]  I will announce by the end of the show who's going to be on the special, but we're going to have a raft of guests and witnesses and insiders and whistleblowers on tomorrow.
[00:07:34.625 --> 00:07:38.026]  And we're going to be taping this special transmission today and tomorrow.
[00:07:38.607 --> 00:07:55.133]  So it'll tape to air and it will be airing exposing the true false flag that was January 6th and how out of that they plan to launch this total takeover of society and civilization of a martial law crackdown the likes of which this country has never seen in the near future.
[00:07:56.394 --> 00:08:03.837]  So exposing this as Tucker Carlson and others are doing right now is absolutely essential to all of our freedoms because
[00:08:04.946 --> 00:08:13.029]  The globalists want a police state in place to destroy the middle class, collapse the economy and consolidate absolute total control.
[00:08:13.049 --> 00:08:20.152]  They're trying to put that police state system in place and turn the entire anti-terrorism apparatus on the American people.
[00:08:21.235 --> 00:08:23.756]  And that's being admitted in mainline publications.
[00:08:24.616 --> 00:08:35.060]  They're saying, we want to arrest all political opposition, we want to make it illegal to not let us sexualize your children, and illegal to not let us teach your children that they're bad because they're white.
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:43.763]  This is just a extremely toxic, extremely criminal, extremely out of control, poisonous, cancerous,
[00:08:45.137 --> 00:08:47.259]  Malignant system they're building.
[00:08:47.299 --> 00:08:49.961]  I mean, here's even mainstream news headlines.
[00:08:50.641 --> 00:08:52.903]  A sea change in counter-terrorism.
[00:08:53.764 --> 00:09:03.271]  Then you read on, it says, no longer is it for radical Islam, it is for gun-owning, Bible-believing, pro-life Christians.
[00:09:04.292 --> 00:09:07.655]  An open declaration of war against
[00:09:09.014 --> 00:09:09.695]  The American people.
[00:09:09.715 --> 00:09:24.893]  And we heard all this from Biden, and we heard it from Psaki, and we heard it from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and we heard it from the Secretary of Defense, and we heard it from the FBI, and we heard it from the ADL, the Southern Poverty Law Center, where they said, arrest people that disagree with our views.
[00:09:25.674 --> 00:09:27.977]  Sacha Baron Cohen called for my arrest.
[00:09:29.841 --> 00:09:33.483]  Because I question a lot of big public events.
[00:09:33.523 --> 00:09:42.907]  I mean, when you hear that on the ADL's main stage, on their national conference, and it's put on C-SPAN, they mean business.
[00:09:44.267 --> 00:09:45.267]  They mean business.
[00:09:46.248 --> 00:09:53.651]  I played that former Deputy Assistant FBI Director clip a few times last week where he said, Oh, I know this is really making you sick to your stomach.
[00:09:54.411 --> 00:09:57.973]  This is really scary, but we've got to go ahead and take out members of Congress.
[00:09:59.821 --> 00:10:02.984]  They're the command and control of the terrorism and of the cult.
[00:10:04.926 --> 00:10:05.507]  Think about that.
[00:10:07.148 --> 00:10:09.150]  Those are not just fighting words.
[00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:24.305]  Those are what an authoritarian state does, because they're illegitimate, and they stole the election, and they know they did, and they've got a bunch of yes-men and women that'll do whatever they're told, a bunch of reality winners, that instead of being in jail, are running the country.
[00:10:25.523 --> 00:10:30.267]  And they intend to make their move because they know the country's awake, the world's waking up.
[00:10:30.287 --> 00:10:33.169]  There's gonna be a giant landslide for good Republican candidates.
[00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:37.913]  They know the election fraud, they are so scared right now, is just mounting.
[00:10:37.953 --> 00:10:44.178]  The evidence is all documented from those six key states where the polls closed and Trump had record high victory.
[00:10:44.559 --> 00:10:50.063]  And then by the end of the night, by the next morning, suddenly all these magic ballots had been found.
[00:10:51.084 --> 00:10:53.386]  All of this is coming out.
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:11:02.145]  And so when you can't maintain control through propaganda, you maintain control through domination and through outlawing your opposition.
[00:11:03.166 --> 00:11:05.267]  And so mainstream media is in free fall.
[00:11:07.188 --> 00:11:14.313]  No one trusts them, no one believes them, but a very small handful of echo chamber individuals that are on Twitter and Facebook and YouTube.
[00:11:14.813 --> 00:11:17.155]  But almost everybody else now sees what's happening.
[00:11:17.315 --> 00:11:22.058]  So the globalists are going to try to launch terror attacks to frame their political opposition
[00:11:24.159 --> 00:11:29.644]  To then be able to intimidate everybody else to say, hey, if you don't want to be arrested, shut up.
[00:11:30.785 --> 00:11:38.431]  Because we'll set you up like Alex Jones or Matt Gaetz or so many other people they're trying to set up right now.
[00:11:38.451 --> 00:11:42.475]  And they're going after President Trump, who they know is about to start his rallies back.
[00:11:42.495 --> 00:11:44.056]  In fact, he already has started them.
[00:11:45.117 --> 00:11:46.118]  And so we're not backing down.
[00:11:46.138 --> 00:11:46.718]  We're not going away.
[00:11:46.758 --> 00:11:48.319]  But let me go ahead and make this big announcement here.
[00:11:48.339 --> 00:11:49.640]  It'll make the left extremely happy.
[00:11:49.941 --> 00:11:51.102]  But they already know this is all going on.
[00:11:52.648 --> 00:12:03.618]  The reason the last two weeks Alex Jones has trended number one and number five and number ten and number one in politics on Twitter and other places is the left went and edited videos of my show.
[00:12:03.898 --> 00:12:04.799]  It's not like they're secret.
[00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:12.386]  And they go, here's Jones admitting to coordinating the January 6th insurrection, as they call it.
[00:12:13.167 --> 00:12:14.928]  And here he is admitting he did it.
[00:12:15.745 --> 00:12:23.993]  When of course it was me talking about us helping organize the Ellipse and that event and the other peaceful events that happened in the months before that and all the other peaceful events.
[00:12:24.954 --> 00:12:35.604]  But they put it out there in Gaslight, people, to try to give cover to the Justice Department and one of the conspirators, the original Oklahoma City attack, Garland, to indict me.
[00:12:36.869 --> 00:12:44.214]  And we've confirmed from a lot of individuals that they've been approached by the FBI and told, just tell us about Alex Jones and we won't indict you.
[00:12:44.294 --> 00:12:47.316]  Just tell us that Alex Jones planned all this.
[00:12:48.317 --> 00:12:49.318]  Well, here's the deal.
[00:12:50.899 --> 00:12:51.579]  I never did that.
[00:12:51.979 --> 00:12:58.644]  And so whoever says that or whoever claims that is a liar and has done so under duress and no one is going to buy that.
[00:13:00.685 --> 00:13:05.629]  So instead, they will simply try to set me up for something else.
[00:13:06.892 --> 00:13:14.075]  So if I'm found dead in a hotel room with a heroin needle in my arm, I don't go to hookers in hotel rooms and I don't take heroin or any other drugs.
[00:13:15.015 --> 00:13:18.117]  If they say I committed suicide, I didn't do that.
[00:13:18.777 --> 00:13:25.239]  Their favorite thing is to kill your whole family with you so you're demonized when they announce you killed yourself and your family, or your family and yourself.
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:26.180]  I would never do that.
[00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:27.440]  That's a classic deep state action.
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:28.661]  If that happens, they did it.
[00:13:29.637 --> 00:13:37.023]  If that happens, you can bet it was directed by the FBI director and by the Attorney General, who are nothing but terrorists that work for the globalists.
[00:13:38.044 --> 00:13:40.466]  And so we're in that area now here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:40.926 --> 00:13:43.068]  I've told Tucker Carlson, they're coming after you and your family.
[00:13:44.309 --> 00:13:47.091]  And you know, you've seen his response.
[00:13:47.131 --> 00:13:47.932]  He knows what's going on.
[00:13:48.092 --> 00:13:49.273]  He's fighting hard for this country.
[00:13:51.074 --> 00:13:53.415]  And I would suggest everybody else does the same.
[00:13:53.635 --> 00:14:04.219]  When they're done, they don't have Frank Figliuzzi or whatever his name is on TV saying, we're going to use counterterrorism operations against Congress for no reason.
[00:14:04.939 --> 00:14:07.480]  They want to have a hot coup where they decapitate
[00:14:08.464 --> 00:14:12.625]  Senator Hawley, Senator Cruz, Senator Paul, they already tried to kill repeatedly.
[00:14:13.165 --> 00:14:19.566]  Just like they tried to send their operative in to kill the Conservative Caucus at that baseball game that was a successful shooting.
[00:14:19.686 --> 00:14:21.107]  Only, thank God, one of the congressmen.
[00:14:22.007 --> 00:14:23.627]  And that's because they had security there.
[00:14:24.487 --> 00:14:31.389]  And so these guys, 110% are on TV saying, we need to use counter-terrorism operations to take out Congress.
[00:14:33.432 --> 00:14:36.414]  Anytime Republicans are together alone, they've got to be very careful.
[00:14:36.994 --> 00:14:38.615]  Everybody's got to increase their security.
[00:14:38.655 --> 00:14:43.879]  That is a prominent pro-America person that's not a traitor, because this is a foreign multinational coup.
[00:14:44.519 --> 00:14:51.804]  This is a takeover, and they're announcing it everywhere to embolden their criminal networks inside the FBI, inside the CIA.
[00:14:51.824 --> 00:14:57.668]  Because I want to be clear, the entire CIA, the entire FBI, the entire Justice Department is not criminals.
[00:14:58.496 --> 00:15:10.079]  But at the top, it is a very sick, evil group of America-hating lawyers who've already sold the country out and who know they're all going to prison when their sellout of the country comes out.
[00:15:10.119 --> 00:15:15.080]  So they were willing to spy on candidate Trump, spy on President Trump.
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:16.100]  We told you all that.
[00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:18.901]  And now they know they're painted into a corner.
[00:15:18.961 --> 00:15:21.261]  So they're going to want to stage terror attacks, really big ones.
[00:15:22.081 --> 00:15:23.822]  And then during the smokescreen of that,
[00:15:24.693 --> 00:15:35.221]  Take out the American leadership, which includes, of course, President Trump, who is now, you see, coming out and saying young people don't need the vaccine, and he's got questions about the vaccine and Fauci now.
[00:15:35.682 --> 00:15:42.167]  Trump is doing the right thing, moving towards exposing the entire deal and extricating himself from that because he didn't do it on purpose, so we forgive him.
[00:15:43.087 --> 00:15:44.248]  So this is do or die.
[00:15:44.348 --> 00:15:47.952]  This is absolute either end of the republic or rebirth of the republic.
[00:15:47.992 --> 00:15:50.694]  This is an incredible, incredible time.
[00:15:51.755 --> 00:15:56.719]  But that's where we are as a society and somebody's got to stand up to these criminals and call them out.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.121]  These are not government officials.
[00:15:58.141 --> 00:16:00.383]  These are foreign, globalist agents.
[00:16:00.423 --> 00:16:01.243]  These are traitors.
[00:16:01.644 --> 00:16:06.168]  These are criminals who want to bring the country down and gut it and they're coming for you and your family.
[00:16:07.589 --> 00:16:09.551]  God didn't put me in this position
[00:16:10.751 --> 00:16:12.571]  At this point, to pull any punches.
[00:16:13.712 --> 00:16:17.653]  In fact, I intend to accelerate everything we're doing to the next level.
[00:16:21.314 --> 00:16:27.255]  But I do call on the power of Christ and the Holy Spirit to lead God and direct me.
[00:16:28.736 --> 00:16:33.857]  And I call on you to pray for me and to pray for President Trump and Tucker Carlson and others.
[00:16:34.477 --> 00:16:35.917]  Because Trump's not backing down.
[00:16:36.057 --> 00:16:36.938]  I'm not backing down.
[00:16:36.978 --> 00:16:38.158]  Carlson's not backing down.
[00:16:39.909 --> 00:16:42.750]  And nobody else I know is backing down, including those members of Congress.
[00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:54.995]  And that's why, get ready with Figliosi please, that's why they've got these monsters on television, very threateningly, menacing Congress, saying we need to take out Congress.
[00:16:55.276 --> 00:16:58.177]  See, I don't think we should take out Democrats.
[00:16:58.337 --> 00:16:59.958]  I don't think we should take out Chuckie Schumer.
[00:17:01.598 --> 00:17:05.200]  If I'd have been saying that, and I'd have been there on January, they should indict me.
[00:17:07.008 --> 00:17:08.549]  That is a overthrow.
[00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:09.891]  That is an attempt to overthrow.
[00:17:10.351 --> 00:17:11.912]  I think he should be indicted for his crimes.
[00:17:11.932 --> 00:17:13.134]  A jury should try him.
[00:17:13.394 --> 00:17:14.355]  Not, he should be killed.
[00:17:15.373 --> 00:17:23.716]  But they're in the news saying we're going to use counter-terrorism on the networks of Trump support and those that question elections, when that's our right to question those elections.
[00:17:23.956 --> 00:17:25.377]  And you're the ones that are terrorists.
[00:17:25.857 --> 00:17:27.658]  And you're the ones that are terrorizing people.
[00:17:27.978 --> 00:17:29.919]  And somebody's got to call your bluff.
[00:17:30.379 --> 00:17:35.101]  Or, if it's not a bluff, everybody's going to see Alex Jones get set up or killed.
[00:17:35.841 --> 00:17:37.962]  That's just the way the ball bounces.
[00:17:39.482 --> 00:17:41.043]  And I am completely comfortable with that.
[00:17:42.688 --> 00:17:45.350]  But one way or the other, you're getting called out for what you've done.
[00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:50.613]  Keep pushing it, and pushing it, and pushing it, and somebody's got to stand up against your ass.
[00:17:52.174 --> 00:18:11.486]  And my main mission is to get other people to stand up in City Hall, and in police departments, and in the state houses, and in the churches, and in the businesses, and in the farms, and in the ranches, and in the factories, and in the mountains, and in the valleys, and on the ocean, and on the lakes, and the streams, and the rivers of this country.
[00:18:13.612 --> 00:18:20.359]  Because to quote Winston Churchill, we will go on to the end, whatever the cost may be, and we will never surrender.
[00:18:22.061 --> 00:18:25.784]  Because that's a drug better than anything I ever felt in my life, being on the side of right.
[00:18:26.618 --> 00:18:44.443]  And not bound to evil and not bound to a bunch of cowards and a bunch of scum lawyers that have been all over boardrooms hyping themselves up how tough they are and how badass they are and how they're gonna whip those Americans and teach those Midwesterners and teach those Texans and teach those people that are hard-working that they're scum and we're under your thumb.
[00:18:44.763 --> 00:18:46.203]  No, we're not under your thumb!
[00:18:49.464 --> 00:18:52.365]  You run this country in the ground, you sold this nation out.
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:57.261]  And you've let the perverts that run San Francisco take control of our schools.
[00:18:57.321 --> 00:18:59.622]  I'm ashamed we haven't done more to oppose you.
[00:19:04.404 --> 00:19:11.327]  Here's one other spokesperson, just like Phil Mudd of the CIA, on TV saying, oh, we're going to kill Trump and we're going to kill them.
[00:19:11.367 --> 00:19:16.229]  And you already, oh yeah, break the ribs of Rand Paul and shoot Scalise.
[00:19:16.269 --> 00:19:17.529]  Too bad they didn't shoot more.
[00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:19.510]  You're the ones want conflict.
[00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:20.971]  You're the ones want to fight.
[00:19:22.108 --> 00:19:23.591]  You're the ones that have to steal the election.
[00:19:25.375 --> 00:19:29.122]  Because you know we're rejecting your slimy asses.
[00:19:29.543 --> 00:19:31.407]  Here's another one of these enemies of America.
[00:19:34.138 --> 00:19:41.022]  Well, domestically, you've got to attack and dismantle the command-and-control element of a terrorist group.
[00:19:41.342 --> 00:19:49.747]  And unfortunately, and I know this is painful to hear, that may mean people sitting in Congress right now, people in and around the former president.
[00:19:50.188 --> 00:19:51.228]  That's how you do this.
[00:19:51.348 --> 00:19:58.613]  Otherwise, recruitment, inciting, and cult-like leadership continues to recruit people to violence.
[00:19:59.671 --> 00:20:01.012]  Uh, what cult should we follow?
[00:20:01.052 --> 00:20:03.233]  The one where we give five-year-olds drag queen story time?
[00:20:03.874 --> 00:20:06.615]  Or the one where we shoot people up with poisonous vaccines, the Bill Gates cult?
[00:20:07.256 --> 00:20:08.536]  Or the open border cult?
[00:20:08.716 --> 00:20:10.577]  Or the, uh, shut down the churches cult?
[00:20:11.518 --> 00:20:13.059]  Uh, or the bankrupt the treasury cult?
[00:20:13.139 --> 00:20:14.520]  Or the sell out to the chi-coms cult?
[00:20:15.776 --> 00:20:17.737]  Because you know, the cult you're offering ain't too cool, man.
[00:20:18.457 --> 00:20:21.478]  We like to want to be in good, strong Americans and coming together and being happy.
[00:20:21.758 --> 00:20:29.120]  And you love radical Islam and every other dirty, horrible, out-of-control thing, and you call us a cult because we won't back down to you?
[00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:40.544]  So we came to peacefully protest an event, and you roped in a tiny fraction of a million people to break in the Capitol so you could call us all terrorists, so you could now say, let's go after members of Congress?
[00:20:40.744 --> 00:20:43.605]  And I've got a bunch of more videos of other people saying it!
[00:20:45.509 --> 00:20:48.890]  They're gonna make their move because they've never gotten in trouble.
[00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:50.450]  What always takes over a third world country?
[00:20:52.731 --> 00:20:58.732]  What always made Rome in its last 300 years constantly be unstable?
[00:21:00.952 --> 00:21:01.812]  The Petroleum Guard.
[00:21:02.733 --> 00:21:03.733]  The Federal Police.
[00:21:06.973 --> 00:21:13.815]  The fall of any republic is when its bureaucracy and its armed men at the top
[00:21:15.771 --> 00:21:19.293]  In control of their corrupt courts, decide to take over.
[00:21:21.274 --> 00:21:22.354]  That's how you become a North Korea.
[00:21:22.374 --> 00:21:25.115]  That's how you become a communist China and Nazi Germany.
[00:21:25.495 --> 00:21:43.884]  And we're following the exact steps directly into that with them saying, officially out of the FBI Justice Department, Merrick Garland, that 65% of the population, half of them above 65, old people, are white supremacists.
[00:21:46.667 --> 00:21:48.288]  So they can be targeted as the enemy.
[00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:54.073]  This is out of some hunchbacked lawyer with a huge criminal history.
[00:21:54.434 --> 00:22:06.744]  And we're all supposed to fall down before him and do whatever he says as the media covers up all the black-on-white crime, exploding with the black killers saying they did it because whites deserve it, because whites are killing them.
[00:22:07.024 --> 00:22:09.026]  And Tucker Carlson said, who can blame them?
[00:22:09.947 --> 00:22:11.728]  You start getting every channel in the country
[00:22:12.856 --> 00:22:15.957]  Saying that a certain group's bad, other groups are going to start killing them!
[00:22:16.197 --> 00:22:17.617]  You know, Hitler did that!
[00:22:18.718 --> 00:22:21.099]  Attorney General, General Garland!
[00:22:21.119 --> 00:22:28.861]  Who sold out to all these foreign banks and Apple Computer with its slave camps and all the corruption they're involved in.
[00:22:30.342 --> 00:22:55.116]  And then they want to rearguard action while they loot the country of having black and white kill each other, and then you point at the conservative nationalist movement trying to bring America together, at President Trump that you deposed in fraud, in your electoral coup, your fraud coup, that he wants division when he did the exact opposite in every poll, so you spewed all the poison you could to create division.
[00:22:59.093 --> 00:22:59.794]  So that's where we are.
[00:22:59.814 --> 00:23:09.280]  I'm going to go to break and I'm going to come back and finish up with this and I've got huge news on the just incredible vaccine death news and more.
[00:23:09.741 --> 00:23:13.584]  Please remember, whatever happens to me, InfoWars is designed to continue on.
[00:23:14.733 --> 00:23:14.933]  I think?
[00:23:30.956 --> 00:23:31.176]  Yes, sir.
[00:23:53.539 --> 00:23:57.223]  And of course, the vitamin D3 as well.
[00:23:57.243 --> 00:24:01.588]  So vitamin D3 with calcium, vitamin C with zinc, and the whole food multivitamin.

[00:24:19.912 --> 00:24:22.114]  What can you do to your iodine conspiracy for yourself?

[00:24:43.513 --> 00:24:43.893]  Stay with us.
[00:24:45.314 --> 00:24:48.096]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this live Friday edition.
[00:24:48.456 --> 00:24:56.121]  When I get up here and I say, hey, we told you this here and there and we showed you all this proof a decade ago, five years ago, it's not to say, hey, look, I'm smart.
[00:24:56.722 --> 00:24:58.543]  It's to say, listen, I know what I'm talking about.
[00:24:58.623 --> 00:24:59.464]  I'm on the right track.
[00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:12.850]  And if you go back, I don't know how long ago this was now, 10, 12, 13 years ago, the MIAC report, we got a secret government document from the state police in Missouri.
[00:25:14.011 --> 00:25:25.502]  And it said that anybody that wants out of the UN, anybody that's pro-gun, anybody that's pro-Ron Paul, anybody that's pro-info wars is a terrorist, and in the future they need to be arrested.
[00:25:26.616 --> 00:25:31.398]  And that was the Southern Property Law Center teaching the police that.
[00:25:31.978 --> 00:25:33.378]  And then folks didn't believe it was real.
[00:25:33.698 --> 00:25:37.420]  And then California police gave us a similar document.
[00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:40.121]  And then Texas police gave us another document.
[00:25:40.221 --> 00:25:42.762]  And then New York police, state police, gave us another document.
[00:25:43.722 --> 00:25:52.825]  And about six months after I broke it, people couldn't believe it, the attorney general came out and she said, yeah, this is actually true.
[00:25:53.726 --> 00:25:54.626]  And we're not ashamed of this.
[00:25:55.717 --> 00:26:16.748]  Then, years later, Obama came out in 2012, that Obama in 2010 directed the Army in a secret Army manual to prepare for gun confiscation, how to process citizens by social security number into, quote, re-education camps.
[00:26:18.329 --> 00:26:21.191]  And they even used the term re-education camp.
[00:26:23.442 --> 00:26:23.722]  I don't know.
[00:26:39.161 --> 00:26:45.048]  The Army itself declassified the internment, resettlement, re-education camp Army document.
[00:26:45.548 --> 00:26:50.194]  Anybody wants it, just type in armyreeducationcampdocumentinfowars.com.
[00:26:50.574 --> 00:26:55.340]  You'll go to the page, you'll see the Army manual, the Army number, and then you can go look it up for yourself.
[00:26:56.937 --> 00:27:04.760]  By the way, only because they got contacted, it was later confirmed, can I tell you that I was given that by good people inside U.S.
[00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:08.641]  Army Intelligence that were pissed off about being given a piece of traitorous crap.
[00:27:09.561 --> 00:27:13.243]  By the way, that was their duty, not just their right.
[00:27:13.703 --> 00:27:23.486]  When you're given a battle plan to take on the American people that's illegal, and to make the majority of America an enemy, well obviously whoever gave that order is the damn enemy.
[00:27:26.628 --> 00:27:34.634]  My default position is to not want to go up against a bunch of murdering crooks at the top of the FBI and the CIA and the rest of it, but somebody's got to do this.
[00:27:35.754 --> 00:27:37.135]  I mean, our country is hijacked.
[00:27:37.296 --> 00:27:39.057]  I cannot not do this.
[00:27:40.398 --> 00:27:43.360]  And if other people had my attitude, we would not be in this bad position we're in.
[00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:52.126]  So, when you turn on the news and you see the former Deputy Assistant Director of the FBI saying
[00:27:53.612 --> 00:28:00.257]  With very menacing face, we need to attack and take out, those are quotes, members of Congress.
[00:28:02.378 --> 00:28:17.049]  Maybe one thing if a shoe salesman said we need to attack and take out members of Congress, you'd go, hey, send the Secret Service, send the Federal Marshals, talk to them, make sure they're not serious, and warn them they could get serious jail time for that, because that's a real threat, but you're a shoe salesman.
[00:28:18.424 --> 00:28:34.908]  When you've been over counter-terrorism, been involved in operations to kill people, extra-judicially, and you say that, then you go, oh, that's what you do for a job, and you're in power, and you say you're coming to kill us.
[00:28:39.769 --> 00:28:43.670]  Well, I take that very, very serious, mister.
[00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:47.111]  You're darn tootin' to quote your FBI director.
[00:28:47.291 --> 00:28:50.371]  I take that as direct threat to me and my family.
[00:28:50.911 --> 00:28:52.052]  And I know it's what it's meant to be.
[00:28:52.592 --> 00:28:53.152]  Threatening me?
[00:28:53.612 --> 00:28:54.612]  Threatening my family?
[00:28:55.172 --> 00:28:56.093]  Threatening Congress?
[00:28:56.433 --> 00:28:58.253]  You dirty little filthy lawyer!
[00:28:58.493 --> 00:28:59.493]  You piece of crap!
[00:28:59.994 --> 00:29:01.474]  Who the hell do you think you are?
[00:29:01.494 --> 00:29:05.575]  I know who you think you are.
[00:29:05.615 --> 00:29:07.235]  You think you rule this country.
[00:29:08.115 --> 00:29:09.436]  You think everybody's intimidated.
[00:29:09.476 --> 00:29:09.976]  Well, I'm not.
[00:29:13.353 --> 00:29:14.474]  You people are the problem.
[00:29:14.814 --> 00:29:16.195]  You're the ones destroying the country.
[00:29:17.516 --> 00:29:19.157]  You're the ones destabilizing everything.
[00:29:19.838 --> 00:29:21.339]  You're the ones screwing the nation over.
[00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:27.283]  Look at Soros with over 800, last time I checked, district attorneys.
[00:29:27.363 --> 00:29:32.747]  It was even more county attorneys, sheriffs, magistrates, mayors.
[00:29:32.987 --> 00:29:33.808]  It's in the thousands.
[00:29:34.489 --> 00:29:36.510]  Almost every major city run by them.
[00:29:37.631 --> 00:29:41.294]  I have a super liberal lawyer that works for me in family matters.
[00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:43.111]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:29:43.191 --> 00:29:46.133]  But he said, Alex, I'm scared for my family.
[00:29:46.433 --> 00:29:52.118]  He said they released in Austin armed robbers that have shot people now with no bail.
[00:29:54.259 --> 00:29:55.661]  Crime is exploding.
[00:29:56.181 --> 00:30:02.086]  They are literally destroying the country by design.
[00:30:06.969 --> 00:30:08.511]  So they take away the police.
[00:30:09.652 --> 00:30:11.133]  They jack up your power prices.
[00:30:12.466 --> 00:30:20.769]  Your streets fall apart, but oh, racism is an environmental crisis in Chicago, the mayor says.
[00:30:22.789 --> 00:30:25.150]  It's all a distraction for the takeover of the country.
[00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:27.431]  They're devaluing the currency, they're annihilating it all.
[00:30:27.911 --> 00:30:42.115]  And all I'm saying is to people on the fence, in the general public, in the government, in the FBI, in whoever you are, this submission to the corporate media and this submission to globalism is suicidal, politically.
[00:30:43.482 --> 00:30:44.684]  It's destructive as hell.
[00:30:45.525 --> 00:30:53.097]  It's going to end in total collapse, and I know that's the globalist plan, but do most of you going along with it have an exit strategy?
[00:30:53.437 --> 00:30:56.182]  Even if you want to see America go down, you're going to go down with it.
[00:30:58.308 --> 00:30:59.089]  It's megalomania.
[00:30:59.129 --> 00:31:01.711]  So here's Judge Andrew Napolitano.
[00:31:02.412 --> 00:31:03.874]  This is from 10 years ago.
[00:31:04.174 --> 00:31:13.183]  He did a whole special on it, but here's just two minutes of it, talking about the FBI and how the majority of plots were actually hatched and run by them.
[00:31:13.503 --> 00:31:15.525]  And that's the same thing going on with January 6th.
[00:31:15.545 --> 00:31:15.886]  Here it is.
[00:31:17.714 --> 00:31:20.075]  Does the government work for us, or do we work for the government?
[00:31:20.395 --> 00:31:24.256]  Can the federal government take credit for saving us from a plot of its own creation?
[00:31:24.836 --> 00:31:30.338]  Tonight, has the federal government kept us safe, or does it just want us to think that it has kept us safe?
[00:31:31.098 --> 00:31:43.121]  Since the tragedy of 9-11, numerous crazies and low-level copycats have engaged in criminal behavior which they hoped would result in the deaths of innocent Americans, and somehow advance their cause of jihad.
[00:31:43.581 --> 00:31:45.062]  If you ask the leadership of the FBI,
[00:31:45.942 --> 00:31:56.869]  Most of whose field agents are tireless, dedicated, Constitution-supporting professionals, it will tell you that it, the FBI, has foiled about 17 plots to kill Americans during the past 10 years.
[00:31:57.549 --> 00:32:04.134]  What it will not tell you is that there have been 20 foiled plots, and of them, three were interrupted by members of the public.
[00:32:04.594 --> 00:32:08.797]  The 17 that were interrupted by the feds were created by the feds.
[00:32:09.670 --> 00:32:12.331]  We all remember the three that were foiled by diligent Americans.
[00:32:12.431 --> 00:32:16.154]  The shoe bomber, the underwear bomber, and the Times Square bomber.
[00:32:16.614 --> 00:32:22.417]  In all of these cases, the crimes charged were those of attempting to kill and conspiring with others to do so.
[00:32:22.917 --> 00:32:33.243]  In all three of those cases, alert Americans on transcontinental flights or in the streets of New York City told authorities of bizarre behavior or actually subdued the threats themselves.
[00:32:33.783 --> 00:32:35.485]  There was no foiling by the FBI.
[00:32:35.805 --> 00:32:42.734]  The plotters were, thankfully, bumbling fools who had poorly planned their criminal behavior and who ended up harming no one.
[00:32:43.234 --> 00:32:44.796]  All three are serving life terms.
[00:32:45.477 --> 00:32:51.063]  But the more curious cases are the remaining 17 for which the federal government has taken credit.
[00:32:51.784 --> 00:32:54.446]  They all have a common and reprehensible thread.
[00:32:54.866 --> 00:32:59.609]  They were planned, plotted, controlled, and carried out by the federal government itself.
[00:33:00.469 --> 00:33:12.156]  In all of these 17 cases, from the Fort Dix 6, to the Lackawanna 7, to the Portland Parade bomber, the feds found young men of Muslim backgrounds, loners who were bitter in America.
[00:33:12.397 --> 00:33:17.480]  They befriended them, cajoled them, and persuaded them that they could change the world by killing Americans.
[00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:24.962]  In all these cases, agents worked undercover and portrayed themselves to the targets as Arabs of like un-American mind.
[00:33:25.502 --> 00:33:29.063]  In some cases, the federal agents used third parties to act as middlemen.
[00:33:29.583 --> 00:33:42.866]  The third parties were typically persons who had been convicted of crimes and who, in return for leniency at their own sentencings, were willing to work with the same feds who prosecuted them in order to help the feds entrap whomever else those feds were pursuing.
[00:33:43.806 --> 00:33:55.292]  Thus, in all 17 of these cases, because of the command and control of federal agents, no one was ever in danger, no one was harmed, no bomb went off, and no property was damaged.
[00:33:55.812 --> 00:34:05.757]  But in all those cases, the losers whom the feds targeted, each believed that they were interacting with real plotters who would bring them cash and bombs.
[00:34:06.477 --> 00:34:09.919]  As we know, sometimes the cash arrived, but the bombs never did.
[00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:11.980]  Are any of these plots criminal?
[00:34:12.581 --> 00:34:18.704]  Can the government just pick and choose whom to seduce and then lower the boom at the right time and arrest its would-be Confederates?
[00:34:19.345 --> 00:34:22.327]  Is this a proper and efficient use of law enforcement resources?
[00:34:23.007 --> 00:34:25.568]  The answers to these questions are obvious and they are not good.
[00:34:26.129 --> 00:34:32.852]  The courts have made this legal so long as the target of these plots had a mental predisposition to cause harm.
[00:34:33.452 --> 00:34:35.273]  But none of this keeps us safe.
[00:34:36.014 --> 00:34:39.916]  All of this makes us less free as any one of us can be entrapped.
[00:34:40.316 --> 00:34:47.840]  And we are fools if we praise the government for exposing a plot of its own creation and saving us from a danger that never existed.
[00:34:48.562 --> 00:34:59.011]  But yes, then the people that set them up would basically be indicted at first, charges later dropped, and then you'll learn that they normally had other charges against them for other crimes that have been dropped in favor of them doing the setup.
[00:34:59.411 --> 00:35:08.218]  And that's exactly what we know is going on at the Capitol on January 6th, where the real command and controllers were actually FBI agents, FBI informants, and other operatives.
[00:35:09.039 --> 00:35:16.062]  Meanwhile, Frank Figliuzzi is on TV saying we need to direct attacks on members of Congress to take them out because they're patriots.
[00:35:16.563 --> 00:35:18.504]  They're the ones engaged in criminal conspiracies.
[00:35:20.425 --> 00:35:21.785]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:35:23.226 --> 00:35:27.268]  The reason I spent a lot of time, obviously, in the last segment
[00:35:28.283 --> 00:35:47.704]  Getting into the FBI, the Justice Department's announcements that they want to take out members of Congress, that we're all terrorist network that's got to be financially shut down, physically set up, physically put in prison, or killed, is because they are globalist criminals that have taken the country over and gotten these agency heads to sign on to it.
[00:35:48.525 --> 00:35:51.107]  Because they were promoted from down low because they were corrupt.
[00:35:51.888 --> 00:35:58.453]  And now they know that America's woken up and America is beating them and America is legally and lawfully taking back the country.
[00:35:59.854 --> 00:36:03.216]  And rejecting their race war and rejecting open borders and rejecting it.
[00:36:03.516 --> 00:36:07.699]  So they're just accelerating the collapse as fast as they can.
[00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:09.501]  So the nation is a failed state.
[00:36:11.044 --> 00:36:20.311]  And so, we'll be too busy just trying to feed ourselves or get our electrical power back on, or to stop a race war, than to be able to ever remove them from office, legally and lawfully.
[00:36:21.052 --> 00:36:25.756]  Not as terrorists, as the left wants to do, but through an election.
[00:36:26.136 --> 00:36:29.478]  Through a legal, lawful process.
[00:36:29.759 --> 00:36:33.762]  And the reason, going back to the documents we first got about constitutional terrorists,
[00:36:36.766 --> 00:36:43.290]  In 2009 and 2010, was people couldn't believe that then, but they were real documents that later they confirmed they were.
[00:36:43.310 --> 00:36:45.351]  Again, the Attorney General later did.
[00:36:46.892 --> 00:36:48.753]  People didn't know what to say when she came out and admitted it all.
[00:36:50.134 --> 00:36:55.517]  And so now you see it again, but out in the open with it being official U.S.
[00:36:55.677 --> 00:36:56.857]  government policy.
[00:36:57.838 --> 00:36:59.379]  Official U.S.
[00:36:59.419 --> 00:37:00.239]  government policy.
[00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:02.401]  A sea change in counterterrorism.
[00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:04.220]  The Lawfare Blog.
[00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:07.001]  The Washington Post has similar headlines.
[00:37:07.601 --> 00:37:11.722]  And it goes on to say, no longer is it Islamic terrorism, or the Chinese, or the Russians.
[00:37:11.782 --> 00:37:12.022]  No!
[00:37:12.942 --> 00:37:16.583]  The CIA, all of it, has pointed inward at the people of the nation.
[00:37:18.563 --> 00:37:32.846]  Fake terror plots, paid informants, the tactics of the FBI, entrapment questioned in the New York Times, and the London Guardian, where out of 100 plus cases, 100 plus, every one of them, was a staged event.
[00:37:36.476 --> 00:37:41.278]  We just showed you some of that famous piece with Andrew Napolitano breaking it down so long ago.
[00:37:41.338 --> 00:37:53.782]  So when you see Tucker Carlson come out and it's in hundreds of publications attacking him saying he's crazy, how dare him say there might have been informants on January 6th, there might have been provocateurs.
[00:37:54.182 --> 00:37:57.283]  They were crawling all over the place.
[00:37:57.783 --> 00:38:05.886]  I remember trying to go cover military drills where the military had told us that they were training for martial law takeover in Florida.
[00:38:07.329 --> 00:38:08.651]  Because the military was concerned about it.
[00:38:08.872 --> 00:38:09.633]  They contacted us.
[00:38:10.495 --> 00:38:12.599]  So I just simply went to cover it in Florida.
[00:38:16.065 --> 00:38:19.311]  And I'd be out there by the airport just legally with a camera.
[00:38:20.307 --> 00:38:24.229]  And a special ops guy would just jump out and start setting fire, saying, Alex, don't you agree?
[00:38:24.689 --> 00:38:26.090]  We're gonna burn things down.
[00:38:26.610 --> 00:38:32.892]  And myself and Mike Hanson had to put the fire out and physically restrain the guy and say, I'm going to kick your ass.
[00:38:33.513 --> 00:38:37.314]  And then the guy ran off into the bushes and was following us around in an unmarked car.
[00:38:37.675 --> 00:38:39.095]  That's what the feds do.
[00:38:42.337 --> 00:38:45.038]  I had him try it again when I was covering Bilderberg in Virginia.
[00:38:46.104 --> 00:38:48.485]  I guess that was about, was it 2008, 2009?
[00:38:49.125 --> 00:38:50.826]  You know, Bilderberg that doesn't exist.
[00:38:50.866 --> 00:38:52.166]  I guess Obama had just been elected.
[00:38:52.206 --> 00:38:52.687]  It was 2009.
[00:38:53.247 --> 00:38:53.927]  Chantilly, Virginia.
[00:38:53.947 --> 00:38:59.109]  And we'd be sitting in our hotel at night just, you know, having a hamburger or whatever, drinking a beer.
[00:38:59.910 --> 00:39:05.592]  Guys would come over and sit down right next to us and say, we think we need to blow up that Chantilly Hotel.
[00:39:07.113 --> 00:39:10.174]  And I had these reporters with me that were following us that made the film New World Order.
[00:39:11.167 --> 00:39:14.909]  And after the guys got, they said, you know, those guys are, those guys are like FBI.
[00:39:14.949 --> 00:39:16.030]  Those guys are trying to set you up.
[00:39:16.070 --> 00:39:17.010]  Hey, my dad's a cop.
[00:39:17.491 --> 00:39:17.871]  Believe me.
[00:39:18.091 --> 00:39:19.472]  I go, you don't think I don't know that?
[00:39:22.553 --> 00:39:24.014]  And I go, by the way, they're not cops.
[00:39:24.214 --> 00:39:25.075]  They're with the Marines.
[00:39:26.536 --> 00:39:30.600]  I saw them earlier before I snuck back out of the hotel, because they were so pissed.
[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:34.824]  I was inside the hotel when they actually closed it for about six hours.
[00:39:35.404 --> 00:39:36.706]  They freaked out so bad.
[00:39:37.206 --> 00:39:39.588]  Those are Marine Corps officers in plain clothes.
[00:39:40.569 --> 00:39:46.475]  And then later they got in an elevator and were threatening me and stuff.
[00:39:47.596 --> 00:39:50.579]  So, this is what goes on.
[00:39:53.001 --> 00:39:55.442]  But now they just go one extension further.
[00:39:55.842 --> 00:40:12.146]  Let's go ahead with the woke military and the woke police that are left, stage big events so they can purge the military, purge the police, and start the mass arrest that will trigger a civil war, which will bring the country into martial law permanently, and then we are going to be an occupied globalist country.
[00:40:13.747 --> 00:40:14.707]  And that's how they want it.
[00:40:14.767 --> 00:40:17.468]  That's why they brought in 50 million Muslims into Europe.
[00:40:19.568 --> 00:40:22.670]  So they can have a group they control that can destabilize the country whenever they want.
[00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:25.471]  And now they're going to do it in America along racial lines.
[00:40:27.232 --> 00:40:28.433]  And they admit they're doing it.
[00:40:28.533 --> 00:40:30.193]  They admit in the Atlantic Council.
[00:40:30.394 --> 00:40:38.318]  And they admit in the WikiLeaks documents that they're going to use race and all of this to... And so they're announcing 65% of the population is terrorist?
[00:40:38.738 --> 00:40:40.058]  And that being white is bad?
[00:40:40.299 --> 00:40:41.959]  And we debate whether that's true or not?
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:43.880]  This is outrageous.
[00:40:44.701 --> 00:40:46.902]  And must be completely rejected.
[00:40:50.251 --> 00:41:01.096]  I have zero guilt wanting to go storm the Capitol and foment riots and make us all look like fools and not get our 10-day investigation we wanted of election fraud.
[00:41:02.236 --> 00:41:07.959]  We were there to show our numbers and show we didn't accept the election results because we knew there was fraud and a call for investigation.
[00:41:08.999 --> 00:41:10.260]  We don't have a motive to do that.
[00:41:11.662 --> 00:41:14.484]  Did I trust that Trump would have somewhat of the control?
[00:41:14.965 --> 00:41:16.566]  He called for National Guard, they didn't get him.
[00:41:17.567 --> 00:41:20.129]  The mayor said no, the mayor, the leader of DC.
[00:41:22.170 --> 00:41:29.776]  Did I just trust in the system and thought, oh well there's no way the police will actually stand down, which they did because they sent the majority of them away for traffic control.
[00:41:31.457 --> 00:41:34.219]  And so am I guilty of walking into an absolute trap?
[00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:36.441]  Absolutely.
[00:41:38.097 --> 00:41:43.279]  But by the grace of God, it fizzled and wasn't one-tenth as bad as the deep state had planned it to be.
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:48.542]  Because you had thousands of people believing they were under Q command.
[00:41:51.163 --> 00:41:54.545]  But thank God I and others got there and stopped them from going into the building.
[00:41:56.426 --> 00:41:59.067]  Or it would have been many, many, many, many, many times worse.
[00:41:59.187 --> 00:42:02.248]  But I can replay this over and over again in my head.
[00:42:02.328 --> 00:42:03.369]  I wish it never would have happened.
[00:42:05.427 --> 00:42:31.057]  But now, to have all these people and their lawyers contact me, and to have the FBI come visit people that have been guests here, people that have worked here, and you name it, and say, just tell us about Alex Jones, and what he's planning, and how he's planning violence, and what he does with money, and anything illegal, and we're not gonna put you in jail.
[00:42:32.452 --> 00:42:34.593]  So does it matter I've done zero wrong?
[00:42:34.633 --> 00:42:35.854]  Does it matter I'm a Boy Scout?
[00:42:37.215 --> 00:42:37.975]  It doesn't matter.
[00:42:38.135 --> 00:42:41.617]  It's because I'm a Boy Scout that I've got to be made an example of.
[00:42:41.657 --> 00:42:42.198]  But you know what?
[00:42:43.899 --> 00:42:48.421]  I respect the viewers and listeners of this show, and I think you're the same type of person I am, no matter what color you are.
[00:42:48.441 --> 00:42:49.702]  You've got red blood and you love God.
[00:42:50.102 --> 00:42:53.484]  That if you see me set up or destroyed, you're not going to back down because of that.
[00:42:53.524 --> 00:42:56.326]  You're going to fight harder than ever to wake people up.
[00:42:57.278 --> 00:42:57.919]  We're good to go.
[00:43:07.779 --> 00:43:10.820]  On to us, and they think this intimidates us.
[00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:16.141]  No, this makes me work a lot harder and have a lot more energy and know that I'm on the right side of history.
[00:43:16.301 --> 00:43:20.962]  I just pray to God to give me the strength to do a good job because I make mistakes and man I mess up.
[00:43:21.662 --> 00:43:22.222]  Don't we all?
[00:43:23.202 --> 00:43:33.824]  And that I can touch your heart and that God can touch your heart through my show using me as a vessel to know how important you are and how much God loves you and how love and coming together is the answer.
[00:43:34.938 --> 00:43:41.600]  I know I get angry as hell, and that's a good motivator, but at the end of the day, we need to do this because we love each other, and we care about justice, and we care about our children together.
[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:46.061]  Now, I haven't hit the huge vaccine news.
[00:43:46.121 --> 00:43:46.861]  It's the worst yet.
[00:43:46.901 --> 00:43:49.062]  A lot of young airline pilots are dying after the vaccine.
[00:43:49.502 --> 00:43:54.063]  British Airways admits that's the case, even in a fact-check article, so this is really serious.
[00:43:54.704 --> 00:44:01.045]  Also, the enslavement of the NFL players, where they're treated like animals and enslaved if they don't take the deadly shots.
[00:44:01.666 --> 00:44:02.806]  There's so much on that front.
[00:44:04.195 --> 00:44:07.417]  That is all coming up as well.

[00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:11.800]  Such an important broadcast.

[00:44:29.293 --> 00:44:30.294]  They have been good sellers.

[00:46:41.589 --> 00:46:47.632]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:46:52.113 --> 00:47:01.417]  John Pierce, founder and CEO of the National Constitutional Law Union, represents a lot of the people being set up by this Reichstag 2.0 event.
[00:47:02.578 --> 00:47:05.219]  He will be joining us coming up.
[00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:06.940]  Hell, who knows?
[00:47:07.060 --> 00:47:07.780]  I might need him.
[00:47:07.821 --> 00:47:18.926]  I've got some good criminal lawyers, but I have absolutely confirmed now that the FBI is going around to a bunch of people saying, we're going to put you in jail unless you tell us about Alex Jones willing to overthrow the government.
[00:47:20.071 --> 00:47:32.619]  When we have Frank Figliosi and others on TV saying they, quote, want to attack members of Congress as terrorists and, quote, remove them using the Patriot Act, which I thought wasn't for citizens.
[00:47:32.659 --> 00:47:35.381]  So everything they say we're doing, they're doing.
[00:47:35.461 --> 00:47:36.422]  It's out of control.
[00:47:36.522 --> 00:47:38.984]  That's coming up next segment.
[00:47:39.284 --> 00:47:40.805]  But I'm not afraid for myself.
[00:47:40.865 --> 00:47:45.248]  I am really concerned for the country, though, because it's like getting the news one day you got cancer.
[00:47:45.348 --> 00:47:46.248]  Everybody knows it's coming.
[00:47:46.268 --> 00:47:47.009]  That or a heart attack.
[00:47:47.449 --> 00:47:58.714]  You know, I'm at peace with it, especially doing the right thing, but to know that they're that criminal, they're that out of control, they've really converted the government from the top corrupt right down to the bottom, and America itself has cancer.
[00:47:58.754 --> 00:47:59.855]  So we'll talk about that in a few minutes.
[00:48:00.515 --> 00:48:15.162]  After he leaves us, they have the equivalent of the Chinese CIA director, the highest level defector ever from China, who's explaining to them exactly what's going on, and he's reportedly handed over to the FBI, which means he goes into a black hole.
[00:48:16.638 --> 00:48:23.823]  The complete list of people on the Chinese Communist payroll, like Joe Biden, Hunter Biden, and of course Biden's brothers.
[00:48:25.184 --> 00:48:27.145]  We'll be talking about all of that coming up.
[00:48:27.245 --> 00:48:32.289]  And of course, the defectors talking about how the Chinese knew about the virus because they were busy cooking it up.
[00:48:32.349 --> 00:48:35.571]  In fact, they bought the virus from Obama who sold it to them.
[00:48:36.091 --> 00:48:37.612]  So now they're pointing fingers back and forth.
[00:48:37.652 --> 00:48:38.633]  The Chinese are actually true.
[00:48:38.693 --> 00:48:40.674]  It came from Obama and Chapel Hill.
[00:48:42.416 --> 00:48:43.997]  They just built upon the virus.
[00:48:45.171 --> 00:48:48.533]  And it's getting to function at Wuhan, so that's all.
[00:48:48.553 --> 00:48:50.474]  People ask, how did I know all this 16 months ago?
[00:48:50.894 --> 00:48:51.895]  This was a major debate in 2015.
[00:48:52.055 --> 00:48:57.718]  This was in almost every prestigious genetic engineering and bioweapon journal.
[00:48:57.778 --> 00:48:59.479]  I mean, we covered it at the time.
[00:48:59.519 --> 00:49:01.240]  It was in like the Journal of Nature, you name it.
[00:49:01.620 --> 00:49:02.001]  Kind of like...
[00:49:02.961 --> 00:49:08.444]  John Stewart was on earlier this week and really made Colbert look like a fool, because he's like, oh, how dare you say it came from Willem.
[00:49:08.464 --> 00:49:12.366]  He goes, it's called the Wuhan Coronavirus Gain-of-Function Lab.
[00:49:12.646 --> 00:49:16.548]  I mean, literally that whole bunch of labs, but each lab has its own name for its own grant.
[00:49:16.908 --> 00:49:19.449]  They had a bunch of coronavirus gain-of-function stuff there.
[00:49:19.469 --> 00:49:22.210]  So just like we know the Fed's provocateur events.
[00:49:22.250 --> 00:49:23.531]  I mean, we know because they've done it over and over again.
[00:49:23.691 --> 00:49:24.271]  It's the same thing.
[00:49:24.291 --> 00:49:25.652]  We know the modus operandi.
[00:49:26.991 --> 00:49:27.631]  So that's coming up.
[00:49:27.931 --> 00:49:33.354]  Hong Kong pays off three patients who suffered adverse reactions to COVID vaccines.
[00:49:34.594 --> 00:49:38.036]  China pushes theory that coronavirus originated in a lab, but says it was from a U.S.
[00:49:38.076 --> 00:49:38.796]  bioweapon lab.
[00:49:39.136 --> 00:49:39.896]  Well, because it was.
[00:49:41.137 --> 00:49:43.898]  Four healthy British airway pilots die in one week.
[00:49:43.978 --> 00:49:46.139]  Airline says no link to COVID vaccine.
[00:49:46.439 --> 00:49:49.741]  And they have a fact check in Reuters saying, is it true?
[00:49:49.761 --> 00:49:51.241]  They go, well, yeah, they did die.
[00:49:51.261 --> 00:49:54.703]  We don't know why, but we're not having high level talks about it.
[00:49:54.983 --> 00:49:55.163]  OK.
[00:49:57.699 --> 00:50:03.024]  Vaccinated travelers won't be allowed to fly due to blood clot in certain countries, like China.
[00:50:05.086 --> 00:50:12.393]  Giant mistake, CDC delays emergency meeting on post-vax heart inflammation due to Juneteenth.
[00:50:13.462 --> 00:50:15.563]  A holiday not even celebrated in Texas.
[00:50:15.583 --> 00:50:16.844]  I mean, I'm all for it.
[00:50:16.864 --> 00:50:19.185]  Let's have Martin Luther King Day 2.0 or something.
[00:50:19.605 --> 00:50:20.385]  Rosa Parks Day.
[00:50:20.405 --> 00:50:22.266]  But no, it's Juneteenth Day.
[00:50:23.387 --> 00:50:26.648]  But you've got to delay an emergency hearing about people dying because you know that.
[00:50:28.089 --> 00:50:30.170]  Top Chinese official defected to the U.S.
[00:50:30.510 --> 00:50:31.530]  with Wuhan secrets.
[00:50:31.551 --> 00:50:34.112]  Again, we'll be getting more of that coming up later.
[00:50:35.092 --> 00:50:39.114]  Scientists admit lab link theory was dismissed due to fear of racism.
[00:50:39.194 --> 00:50:40.655]  Yes, racism.
[00:50:41.701 --> 00:50:45.083]  Former State Department Investigator China already knew the origin of the pandemic.
[00:50:45.183 --> 00:50:45.764]  Of course they did.
[00:50:47.065 --> 00:50:48.165]  Why'd our media try to cover it up?
[00:50:48.185 --> 00:50:50.367]  Because it goes back to Biden and Obama.
[00:50:50.847 --> 00:50:51.287]  Mic drop!
[00:50:51.327 --> 00:50:57.652]  Representative Thomas Massey, schooled reporter, who asks if he's vaccinated by the COVID vaccine, explains to him, I've already had it, you idiot.
[00:50:58.527 --> 00:51:02.430]  And you see, folks, if you've had it and take the vaccine, that's when you get the really bad reactions.
[00:51:02.811 --> 00:51:03.551]  And that's a fact.
[00:51:03.611 --> 00:51:07.835]  But, you know, all these big venues in New York parks and places don't care.
[00:51:07.875 --> 00:51:12.999]  They go, doesn't matter whether if your doctor says the vaccine might hurt you because you already have anaphylactic issues.
[00:51:13.139 --> 00:51:13.540]  Take it.
[00:51:14.461 --> 00:51:15.702]  We're all your doctors now.
[00:51:16.803 --> 00:51:21.627]  Well, finally, Trump's starting to wake up, says COVID vaccine for young people unnecessary, probably dangerous.
[00:51:21.927 --> 00:51:22.527]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:22.547 --> 00:51:22.928]  Stay with us.
[00:51:24.522 --> 00:51:27.264]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:51:27.304 --> 00:51:34.790]  We're now into our number two as we broadcast worldwide on this June 18th Friday transmission.
[00:51:36.155 --> 00:51:45.438]  Well, you've seen Tucker Carlson come out and point out that there's clearly FBI informants and others being protected in what happened at the Capitol event on January 6th.
[00:51:45.458 --> 00:51:47.419]  We're being told it was the biggest insurrection in U.S.
[00:51:47.439 --> 00:51:51.980]  history, as bad as Pearl Harbor, worse than 9-11, and then building on that,
[00:51:54.901 --> 00:52:03.947]  The system is now saying that they want to use the military, the CIA, the Patriot Act, to frustrate the leadership that causes radicalization.
[00:52:04.247 --> 00:52:20.398]  So now if you say things like the election was stolen or Biden's a communist Chinese agent, well they're saying that's incitement and so you can be arrested, you can be grabbed, you can be gone after because of all of that.
[00:52:21.479 --> 00:52:25.280]  Well, he represents more than 10 people that have been arrested.
[00:52:25.340 --> 00:52:37.122]  John M. Pierce is a trial lawyer, founder and managing partner of Pierce Brainbridge Constitutional Civil Liberties and Business Litigation Law Firm, a graduate of Harvard Law, where he served as the editor of the Harvard Law Review.
[00:52:37.542 --> 00:52:39.182]  Oh, wow, that's something even Obama did, too.
[00:52:39.502 --> 00:52:44.003]  Prior to law school, John was an M1A1 Abrams tank platoon leader in the U.S.
[00:52:45.083 --> 00:52:45.304]  Army.
[00:52:45.364 --> 00:52:46.164]  In 2017, he founded
[00:52:48.632 --> 00:52:49.493]  We're good to go.
[00:53:10.436 --> 00:53:13.559]  Law union to fight for those who cannot fight for themselves.
[00:53:13.799 --> 00:53:16.102]  NCLU.com.
[00:53:16.242 --> 00:53:17.483]  NCLU.com.
[00:53:17.843 --> 00:53:19.805]  National Constitutional Law Union.
[00:53:20.146 --> 00:53:29.735]  And I couldn't think of a better time to have a heavy hitter like this patriot, this veteran on our side because clearly they're going, they said they want to round up their political opposition.
[00:53:30.556 --> 00:53:31.737]  And so he joins us now.
[00:53:31.797 --> 00:53:32.578]  John, thanks for coming on.
[00:53:34.022 --> 00:53:42.532]  Thank you so much for having me on again, Alex, and thank you for everything that you were doing to help these American patriots and to stand up and fight for the Constitution.
[00:53:43.112 --> 00:53:47.835]  I don't mean to put myself gonzo journalism style front and center here, but I probably need to talk to you.
[00:53:47.895 --> 00:53:53.539]  I need to call some other criminal lawyers that I've had to contact and talk to, but you've been really in the middle of this.
[00:53:53.599 --> 00:53:56.581]  My lawyers haven't been, so they'll probably say talk to you anyways.
[00:53:56.961 --> 00:54:04.286]  I have the FBI circling around talking to former employees, people that I barely even know or hardly ever talk to, asking them.
[00:54:04.306 --> 00:54:05.627]  So it's a whole spectrum.
[00:54:06.007 --> 00:54:13.330]  You know, tell us about Alex Jones and how he planned it and what he's planning to do in the future or anything illegal Alex Jones is doing.
[00:54:13.350 --> 00:54:17.152]  They've got this dragnet out to get me and I know a lot of other people as well.
[00:54:19.473 --> 00:54:28.417]  So clearly the federal government has gotten, you know, very aggressive on these fronts and this has been going on, you know, for the last few years.
[00:54:28.797 --> 00:54:35.460]  And as I think you know, I really started to get involved in the middle of this a few years ago when I started to represent George Papadopoulos
[00:54:35.700 --> 00:54:35.780]  Yes.
[00:54:53.829 --> 00:55:00.217]  That in the last few years, you know, the law enforcement and intelligence apparatus of this country has gotten very aggressive.
[00:55:01.038 --> 00:55:13.372]  It has accelerated at a very rapid pace since the Biden administration has taken over, and our constitutional rights are being shredded, eviscerated day by day, and it is happening very fast.
[00:55:13.752 --> 00:55:20.017]  And so that's why I started the NCLU, essentially the answer to the ACLU, which is completely done.
[00:55:20.097 --> 00:55:24.021]  I mean, they don't do anything anymore to protect anyone's constitutional rights.
[00:55:24.041 --> 00:55:39.233]  So the NCLU is here to be a centralized organization and place where folks can donate to support the litigants that have these cases where the government is really coming after them very hard and they really don't have anywhere else to turn.
[00:55:40.254 --> 00:55:44.898]  John, I hadn't forgotten the George Papadopoulos thing and that whole setup and how you were on.
[00:55:44.918 --> 00:55:46.039]  There's just so much to cover.
[00:55:46.399 --> 00:55:47.300]  So much has gone on.
[00:55:47.340 --> 00:55:53.664]  But the illegal spying on Trump, the lying about it, the lying to Congress, and now just the escalation in corruption.
[00:55:53.704 --> 00:55:54.625]  They never got in trouble.
[00:55:54.985 --> 00:56:07.115]  So it looks like they're even more emboldened than ever with Frank Figliuzzi of the FBI on TV saying, let's use anti-terror tactics and take out the networks, including the leaders in Congress.
[00:56:07.135 --> 00:56:10.077]  Well, all that is, let's take out bin Laden, let's take out
[00:56:11.058 --> 00:56:16.284]  But the leadership, this is classic military nomenclature.
[00:56:18.402 --> 00:56:19.943]  This is very brazen.
[00:56:20.603 --> 00:56:21.584]  It is very aggressive.
[00:56:21.684 --> 00:56:28.188]  I don't think it's something that folks like you and I, well, you know, you might have seen it coming before I did, but, you know, this is not the country I grew up in.
[00:56:28.428 --> 00:56:36.232]  And, you know, I'm actually very saddened, you know, shocked and surprised to see how aggressive these things are happening.
[00:56:36.613 --> 00:56:41.316]  It doesn't seem like something that should be or would happen in the United States, but it is happening.
[00:56:42.076 --> 00:56:45.198]  And we all need to stand up and fight against it.
[00:56:45.458 --> 00:56:56.267]  How would you categorize it as a veteran, as a lawyer, as a smart guy that's been studying this, and on the inside of it, as an authoritarian takeover, as a political purge?
[00:56:56.347 --> 00:56:58.989]  I mean, because this is classical tyranny.
[00:57:00.100 --> 00:57:10.210]  Well, I think, look, generally speaking, and I need to be, as you know, I need to be careful in talking about the specific cases that I'm involved in as a lawyer with respect to the defendants, you know, on January 6th.
[00:57:10.771 --> 00:57:16.637]  But as I have said, and as, you know, I've said in connection with founding the NCLU,
[00:57:17.438 --> 00:57:23.905]  Generally speaking, I think this is an attempted leftist totalitarian takeover of the United States.
[00:57:23.965 --> 00:57:26.268]  It's very similar to a Maoist revolution.
[00:57:27.309 --> 00:57:31.473]  The playbook is very standard and well-worn throughout history.
[00:57:31.954 --> 00:57:35.276]  They attempt to destroy everything that is old and sacred in society.
[00:57:35.356 --> 00:57:36.957]  They attempt to tear down statues.
[00:57:37.318 --> 00:57:39.099]  They attempt to break up the nuclear family.
[00:57:39.419 --> 00:57:40.780]  They attempt to attack religion.
[00:57:41.100 --> 00:57:48.745]  They attempt to destroy history so that they can rewrite on a blank slate whatever they want and create sort of a cult of the state.
[00:57:48.765 --> 00:57:50.506]  They take over the local police.
[00:57:50.927 --> 00:57:52.288]  They destabilize the culture.
[00:57:52.308 --> 00:57:53.268]  They debase the country.
[00:57:53.308 --> 00:57:54.309]  They destroy the borders.
[00:57:54.649 --> 00:58:01.734]  They collapse the civilization and out of that crisis set up a new central government that then carries out a giant purge of its enemies that last decades.
[00:58:03.115 --> 00:58:04.076]  That's precisely right.
[00:58:04.096 --> 00:58:15.108]  I think one of the scariest things that you're seeing on this front, you know, obviously they've been very successful on taking over those institutions that you mentioned, you know, academia, you know, the media, Wall Street, Silicon Valley.
[00:58:15.529 --> 00:58:22.877]  I'm very concerned about the way they seem to be making a very hard go at taking over the military with this wokeness.
[00:58:23.597 --> 00:58:36.941]  You know, this stuff where you see sort of the constant talk about race and critical race theory and transgender rights and these sort of things, that has no place in the United States military.
[00:58:36.961 --> 00:58:39.361]  The United States military is there for one purpose.
[00:58:39.401 --> 00:58:42.682]  It's there to fight and win wars, to close with and destroy the enemy.
[00:58:42.722 --> 00:58:46.063]  When I was in the 1st Cavalry Division, there was no such thing.
[00:58:46.303 --> 00:58:47.545]  We were united.
[00:58:47.565 --> 00:58:49.327]  We didn't see skin color.
[00:58:49.767 --> 00:58:50.868]  We didn't see any of that stuff.
[00:58:50.988 --> 00:58:56.535]  We were just united in a common purpose of preparing to close within, destroy the enemy, and overcome obstacles.
[00:58:56.555 --> 00:58:57.916]  So that is very concerning.
[00:58:58.437 --> 00:59:04.424]  I really worry for the United States military when we have our next great power conflict, and there will be one at some point soon.
[00:59:06.325 --> 00:59:07.206]  Well, exactly.
[00:59:08.247 --> 00:59:15.354]  What they're doing to the military with this malice brainwashing is the perfect way to destroy the unit cohesion, to break them down, to turn people against each other.
[00:59:15.674 --> 00:59:18.457]  They know exactly what they're doing and so does the new Secretary of Defense.
[00:59:20.464 --> 00:59:21.345]  Oh, that's absolutely right.
[00:59:21.385 --> 00:59:23.266]  I mean, this is this is a plan.
[00:59:23.926 --> 00:59:46.221]  You know, I mean, I think you saw it, you know, a couple of months ago when there was a concerted, coordinated attack against an American journalist, Tucker Carlson, who simply, you know, sort of questioned, you know, whether they should be focused on on maternity uniforms when they were promoting, you know, marine female generals at a ceremony instead of their service record.
[00:59:46.401 --> 00:59:47.082]  He questioned that.
[00:59:47.382 --> 00:59:50.384]  And the next day, the entire leadership of the Department
[00:59:50.404 --> 00:59:50.784]  I think so.
[01:00:11.164 --> 01:00:14.186]  You know, diversity and anxiety disorder and all these things.
[01:00:14.246 --> 01:00:20.430]  And by the way, those in and of themselves are not bad things to be talking about, but that's not what the CIA is there for.
[01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:22.532]  That's not what the United States military is there for.
[01:00:22.872 --> 01:00:23.973]  They're there for one purpose.
[01:00:24.013 --> 01:00:25.293]  They're not a social experiment.
[01:00:25.313 --> 01:00:28.676]  There's not a human right to serve in the military or the CIA.
[01:00:28.976 --> 01:00:33.239]  Those entities need the best and brightest among us who are going to accomplish the mission, and that's it.
[01:00:33.999 --> 01:00:34.539]  Oh, that's right.
[01:00:34.559 --> 01:00:45.446]  And we're going to come back and talk about what's happening with January 6th, how it's being used as the narrative, as the legend for this new civil war they're trying to trigger with all these people that have chips on their shoulders.
[01:00:45.746 --> 01:00:46.267]  We'll be right back.
[01:00:46.287 --> 01:00:46.667]  Stay with us.
[01:00:48.188 --> 01:00:48.428]  All right.
[01:00:48.468 --> 01:00:49.589]  John Pierce is with us.
[01:00:49.629 --> 01:00:52.371]  He's a prominent, well-known, respected lawyer, a veteran.
[01:00:53.311 --> 01:01:00.596]  He founded NCLU, National Constitutional Law Union, after he saw what happened to George Papadopoulos and the attempts to set him up as a Russian agent.
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:04.341]  So the time we have left, I wanted to put out the big picture for folks.
[01:01:04.381 --> 01:01:14.945]  Now, zooming in on the victims of what happened, we've got these unindicted co-conspirators, the Tuckers, on to do.
[01:01:15.245 --> 01:01:20.747]  I want to talk about that with you, sir, but getting back to not the specifics of your clients and their cases, but just in general,
[01:01:21.207 --> 01:01:23.688]  What you're witnessing in and around this event.
[01:01:23.788 --> 01:01:35.094]  No charges for all the Antifa people or charges dropped, including burning down police stations, hitting people with clubs and hatchets, throwing Molotov cocktails on police.
[01:01:35.434 --> 01:01:41.057]  That stuff's all been dropped or has been dropped, but the book's being thrown at people that walk through velvet ropes.
[01:01:41.777 --> 01:01:42.558]  Can you speak to that?
[01:01:43.908 --> 01:01:48.369]  Yeah, that's very, very concerning from a selective prosecution standpoint.
[01:01:48.429 --> 01:01:58.131]  I mean, I think that what you're seeing, and all Americans are seeing this, is that it appears that we have two systems of justice in this country at this point.
[01:01:58.792 --> 01:02:04.413]  It's in direct violation of essentially one of the master principles of the American idea and the American system, which is
[01:02:04.793 --> 01:02:05.273]  We're good to go.
[01:02:23.164 --> 01:02:37.275]  And then you do not see that same effort, the same degree of resources, the same pre-dawn raids with respect to folks who are burning down Kenosha, Wisconsin, and Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Washington with these autonomous zones.
[01:02:37.315 --> 01:02:42.119]  And I would argue that that kind of thing was the true insurrection.
[01:02:42.159 --> 01:02:50.386]  You know, one thing I want to say about this insurrection narrative, and the left is very good, perhaps better than us, at using language to further their political agenda.
[01:02:50.867 --> 01:02:57.359]  You know, it is just false to be describing this as January 6th as some sort of insurrection or sedition.
[01:02:58.020 --> 01:03:02.289]  There are no charges against anyone for insurrection or sedition.
[01:03:02.854 --> 01:03:03.494]  Those are crimes.
[01:03:04.035 --> 01:03:13.099]  If the federal government believed that the elements of those crimes were satisfied, you can be sure that those crimes would have been charged.
[01:03:13.839 --> 01:03:27.245]  And generally speaking, I also want to say about January 6th in general, with respect to the folks who showed up in Washington, D.C., not necessarily the folks who went to the Capitol, but the folks who generally showed up in Washington, D.C., they were there
[01:03:27.866 --> 01:03:28.467]  We're good.
[01:03:43.751 --> 01:03:52.158]  And that includes, mind you, and I think, like me, you have no love lost sometimes for the Republican establishment.
[01:03:52.538 --> 01:03:59.664]  I think that a lot of state legislatures, including Republican-controlled state legislatures, dropped the ball, did not do their job.
[01:03:59.924 --> 01:04:12.855]  What they should have done was refuse to certify the elections in their states, and that would have not allowed Joe Biden to receive 270 electoral votes, and it would have been kicked to the House under the 12th Amendment.
[01:04:13.195 --> 01:04:18.556]  That would have been the proper constitutional way to handle this to make sure there was some legitimacy in this election.
[01:04:20.056 --> 01:04:30.398]  We're starting to see reports even in Politico that they're gonna have to drop a lot of these charges and things because there's just no evidence of what they've even charged them with in many of the cases.
[01:04:30.418 --> 01:04:41.560]  I know you can't get into your clients specifically, but what can you say about that and then the treatment of the solitary confinement and the locking them in the bottom of this jail and people having their eyes beaten out reportedly?
[01:04:43.769 --> 01:04:54.472]  Yeah, so first of all, with respect to evidence, just like you and the rest of the public, myself and defense counsel are waiting to see the evidence.
[01:04:55.112 --> 01:05:01.534]  There is some discovery, some evidence specific to particular cases that is dripping out bit by bit.
[01:05:01.934 --> 01:05:09.456]  But in terms of what we really need to see, we need to see those 15,000 hours of video that were taken at the Capitol.
[01:05:11.417 --> 01:05:13.738]  We need to see exactly what happened at the Capitol that day.
[01:05:14.439 --> 01:05:21.243]  I can tell you with respect to all of my clients, our defendants, we are taking every single one of those cases to trial.
[01:05:21.623 --> 01:05:30.468]  We intend to seek full acquittals and I believe that is candidly the only way that we're going to expose the truth of what actually happened on January 6th.
[01:05:31.249 --> 01:05:31.749]  With respect to
[01:05:35.311 --> 01:05:36.272]  We are very concerned.
[01:05:37.032 --> 01:05:47.099]  I have two clients, well it's growing now, but at least two clients as we speak who are detained, actually three or four, and we are very concerned.
[01:05:47.139 --> 01:05:48.780]  So one of them is Christopher Worrell.
[01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:49.941]  He's from Florida.
[01:05:50.281 --> 01:05:52.002]  He has non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
[01:05:52.102 --> 01:05:53.243]  It's getting worse by the day.
[01:05:53.643 --> 01:05:56.225]  He contracted COVID while he was in jail.
[01:05:56.265 --> 01:05:58.206]  He has not been allowed to see his oncologist.
[01:05:58.227 --> 01:06:01.469]  He has not been allowed to receive the cancer treatment that was
[01:06:01.909 --> 01:06:04.611]  Wow, so that's your client that happened to?
[01:06:27.905 --> 01:06:29.346]  That is now my client, that's right.
[01:06:30.246 --> 01:06:32.967]  And so, you know, he needs treatment, you know, like now.
[01:06:33.928 --> 01:06:40.591]  His situation is such that if he doesn't get MRIs, if he doesn't get surgery, you know, he's going to be more and more crippled for life.
[01:06:41.611 --> 01:06:49.355]  I have another client who has, you know, 95% kidney failure, who needs dialysis and is not receiving dialysis.
[01:06:49.875 --> 01:06:51.576]  There is a very real possibility that
[01:06:52.456 --> 01:06:54.138]  One or more of these individuals could die.
[01:06:54.158 --> 01:06:58.381]  Pre-trial, while they're awaiting a trial, you know, being detained.
[01:06:58.401 --> 01:07:01.284]  It's very concerning.
[01:07:01.304 --> 01:07:02.685]  That's what I've heard about the court testimony.
[01:07:02.705 --> 01:07:08.911]  I guess it's your client, you were there, but the lawyer put forward to the transcriber, I guess that was you, or correct me if I'm wrong, that...
[01:07:09.511 --> 01:07:13.575]  That the guards, predominantly black, actually believe these are white supremacists they're beating.
[01:07:13.675 --> 01:07:25.047]  So, they're believing the narrative of the Attorney General and others that have called them all white supremacists, which white supremacists don't deserve to be beaten, but the point is, they're demonizing them, and so that's part of the reason they're being assaulted.
[01:07:26.465 --> 01:07:33.575]  Well, I just took over that case, so whatever you would have seen in terms of a transcript would have been a different lawyer.
[01:07:34.516 --> 01:07:39.643]  I can't speak first-hand to precisely what is occurring inside the facilities.
[01:07:41.745 --> 01:07:43.888]  I don't want to... Sure.
[01:07:43.908 --> 01:07:45.230]  Well, John Pierce, I know you've got to go.
[01:07:45.250 --> 01:07:49.014]  I want to get you back up with other updates every week or so as this unfolds.
[01:07:49.455 --> 01:07:50.856]  NCLU.com.
[01:07:51.177 --> 01:07:55.962]  I appreciate you stepping up with other lawyers to do this and helping all these people out.
[01:07:56.002 --> 01:07:56.924]  So God bless you.
[01:07:57.204 --> 01:07:59.387]  In a minute and a half, other points you want to impart to the viewers.
[01:08:00.905 --> 01:08:04.409]  Yeah, the most important thing, Alex, is we need help with the NCLU.
[01:08:04.869 --> 01:08:11.055]  Anything anyone can do, you know, small dollar donations, big dollar donations, volunteer, have lawyers reach out.
[01:08:11.175 --> 01:08:15.620]  If folks or clients that need legal help, you know, reach out to us.
[01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:21.726]  You know, this is the ACLU of the future and of right now, except we're actually going to protect
[01:08:22.126 --> 01:08:28.330]  Everyone's constitutional rights, and I want to be clear that this is not a Republican organization This is not a conservative organization.
[01:08:28.350 --> 01:08:47.160]  You know I myself of course am an American first conservative populist You know a person but but but the reason that we have a constitution that lasts for decades and generations If we save it this time is that we fight for everyone's constitutional rights, and that's what we're going to do finally you know I would like to say
[01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:52.703]  What I think is very important in the country right now, first of all, everyone needs to get off the sidelines and help.
[01:08:53.283 --> 01:08:53.903]  It's go time.
[01:08:54.244 --> 01:08:55.184]  We're in a fourth turning.
[01:08:55.204 --> 01:08:55.964]  This is a crisis.
[01:08:55.984 --> 01:08:56.965]  We need everyone's help.
[01:08:57.285 --> 01:09:02.468]  But I think two things that we need to do as a country are, number one, we have to return to our founding principles.
[01:09:02.768 --> 01:09:10.232]  We have to return to limited government, a federal government of enumerated powers that's very limited with everything reserved to the states under the Tenth Amendment.
[01:09:10.532 --> 01:09:12.413]  Finally, we need to return to God.
[01:09:12.713 --> 01:09:19.876]  No matter what the Constitution says, if we do not have a virtuous citizenry and a moral people, you know, we're in real trouble.
[01:09:20.076 --> 01:09:20.816]  So that's what I think.
[01:09:20.857 --> 01:09:22.537]  John Pierce, I totally agree.
[01:09:22.577 --> 01:09:23.238]  Thank you so much.
[01:09:23.278 --> 01:09:23.698]  God bless you.
[01:09:23.718 --> 01:09:24.298]  Have a good weekend.
[01:09:26.039 --> 01:09:26.299]  All right.
[01:09:26.359 --> 01:09:27.680]  It's Friday, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:09:27.740 --> 01:09:28.780]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:32.162]  We reached the halfway point of the broadcast that I'm hosting.
[01:09:33.183 --> 01:09:42.587]  But we have a great guest host in the fourth hour ahead of what's going to be unfolding with Owen Schroyer and The War Room coming up.
[01:09:43.988 --> 01:09:50.130]  You'll definitely want to tune in to the broadcast this weekend, and on Sunday, and on Monday, I am going to be in New York City.
[01:09:51.611 --> 01:09:55.392]  And we're going to be there on some special missions of justice and freedom.
[01:09:56.593 --> 01:09:59.034]  So that is all coming up as well.
[01:10:00.814 --> 01:10:11.899]  I want to open the phones up before Max Keiser joins us in the last 30 minutes of the next hour on the inflationary numbers coming out that are so serious.
[01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:19.343]  And then we also have Stu Peters hosting the fourth hour today.
[01:10:20.684 --> 01:10:27.567]  And then, of course, we also just had John Pierce on with the important work that John is doing.
[01:10:30.865 --> 01:10:33.487]  You see all this news I've got in front of me, if you're a TV viewer.
[01:10:33.607 --> 01:10:35.168]  I've got a couple hundred articles here.
[01:10:35.188 --> 01:10:35.869]  They're all important.
[01:10:35.889 --> 01:10:37.290]  They're all insanely over-the-top.
[01:10:39.412 --> 01:10:51.341]  But if you don't realize that we have megabanks and megacorporations that have a unified global anti-human agenda, and that they have a plan, none of this makes sense.
[01:10:51.501 --> 01:10:57.586]  But when you understand that, you see the agenda to make things bad, to collapse things, to slowly poison people.
[01:10:58.663 --> 01:11:07.886]  And then have the corrupt medical system absorb the people that they've actually poisoned and then extract all of their wealth out of them while they kill them.
[01:11:09.547 --> 01:11:28.014]  And I've really been heartened by how many tens of thousands of prominent doctors and scientists and nurses and others have gone public and said COVID's a takeover and really been doing a great job exposing the suppression of totally viable treatments and the rest of it.
[01:11:29.326 --> 01:11:29.986]  But it's not enough.
[01:11:32.088 --> 01:11:50.502]  Because the leadership of the New World Order, the Klaus Schwab's, the Bill Gates's, and the Prince Charles's of the world, they are not worried about ever being held accountable for the depopulation operation they're carrying out against us.
[01:11:50.562 --> 01:11:54.805]  So at the end of the day, I'm infuriated with Frank Figliuzzi,
[01:11:56.189 --> 01:12:08.555]  Just a dirty, corrupt, evil Democrat lawyer on TV at the FBI saying we're going to wage war against Congress with anti-terrorism tactics because they're radicalizing people.
[01:12:09.256 --> 01:12:11.977]  Oh, we're going to kill this imam because he's radicalizing people.
[01:12:13.378 --> 01:12:15.419]  I mean, those are declarations of war.
[01:12:15.999 --> 01:12:18.821]  But that guy is like dog manure.
[01:12:19.561 --> 01:12:21.722]  I don't want to run out in the field and stomp on it and attack it.
[01:12:21.802 --> 01:12:23.063]  I want it to stay away from me.
[01:12:23.563 --> 01:12:24.544]  Now get that clip ready again.
[01:12:26.707 --> 01:12:31.188]  But I want you to understand, that is them externalizing their operation against us.
[01:12:31.288 --> 01:12:35.810]  So, they're really going to make this move.
[01:12:35.850 --> 01:12:36.610]  They're doing it now.
[01:12:36.770 --> 01:12:38.030]  And it makes me sick to my stomach.
[01:12:39.250 --> 01:12:45.732]  I just want to be happy and live my life and go to the national parks and go drive around, you know, on a motorboat and eat enchiladas.
[01:12:46.312 --> 01:12:50.373]  But there's a bunch of creepy, weird dudes that want to run the world and they're not going to stop.
[01:12:51.994 --> 01:12:53.314]  I mean, these are sickos, man.
[01:12:54.535 --> 01:12:55.735]  And, I mean, I can tell you,
[01:12:57.538 --> 01:13:19.331]  I was told this by Ted Gunnarson, who was a good FBI agent, and I was told this by Benton Parton, who was the former head of Air Force Weapons Development, and I was told this by General Stubblebine, that was the head of all special forces, and I was told this by all these old-timers, and I didn't think they were crazy, because they were dead-on about the history I knew, but they all told me it was a bunch of devil-worshipping pedophiles at the top.
[01:13:22.252 --> 01:13:23.173]  And it turns out they weren't.
[01:13:25.592 --> 01:13:33.194]  That's who was on the top, and General Stubblebine and General Partin and Ted Gunnarsson all told me the truth.
[01:13:35.655 --> 01:13:48.098]  In fact, I got chills a couple years ago when the FBI released, because of statute of limitations and because of the declassification laws, 30-year-old documents from the Finders case.
[01:13:49.315 --> 01:13:50.375]  And 40-year-old documents.
[01:13:51.216 --> 01:13:55.097]  And I was reading, it was over a thousand pages of it, and I was just scanning through it for a couple hours.
[01:13:55.858 --> 01:13:57.659]  And I was physically getting nauseous.
[01:13:59.599 --> 01:14:05.462]  Because I was having flashbacks to Ted Gunnarsson on my show and other shows and big speeches he gave across the country.
[01:14:08.243 --> 01:14:11.464]  And I was sitting there, reading it, and this was stuff he told me.
[01:14:12.925 --> 01:14:17.407]  And this was the FBI reports and all of it, and the confirmation of the CIA child kidnapping.
[01:14:18.151 --> 01:14:18.691]  And just all of it.
[01:14:18.731 --> 01:14:22.714]  And look, there are plenty of Ted Gonderson still in the FBI.
[01:14:22.734 --> 01:14:26.776]  There are plenty of General Partons still in the military, but they're not at the top of it.
[01:14:28.838 --> 01:14:34.861]  And so I know it's scary to know we got a bunch of pedophile devil worshippers running stuff, but that's just the way it is.
[01:14:34.881 --> 01:14:36.302]  The Bible told us that happens.
[01:14:38.764 --> 01:14:44.027]  And so we just have to say no to these people, and we have to stand up against them and speak out against them.
[01:14:45.608 --> 01:14:46.709]  And we've got to be smart, too.
[01:14:47.813 --> 01:14:52.696]  We need more rallies around the nation saying we don't buy open borders and globalism and election fraud.
[01:14:53.217 --> 01:14:55.698]  And we've done a great job not being violent in the past.
[01:14:55.738 --> 01:14:58.380]  We got set up on January 6th because we got too confident.
[01:15:00.862 --> 01:15:12.690]  But we just really have to get aggressive, just like the lawyer we had on earlier, who had a big private practice doing very, very well, but decided to do this because he's drawn to it because he's a veteran and he sees what's happening to the country.
[01:15:15.796 --> 01:15:21.960]  And so I'm going to come back and I'm going to hit the latest COVID news and this Chinese defector and just the incredible nature of it.
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:25.002]  It all just gets more insane each chapter, each day as we go here.
[01:15:25.022 --> 01:15:31.145]  And then I'm going to open the phones up for first-time callers, any subjects you want to discuss.
[01:15:31.205 --> 01:15:35.348]  But obviously, what do you think of the declaration of war against the American people by the deep state?
[01:15:36.725 --> 01:15:39.646]  What do you think about all the Wuhan news coming out and the wheels coming off?
[01:15:40.266 --> 01:15:45.147]  What do you make of the horrible job Biden's doing and how he can hardly talk now and how long can this farce go?
[01:15:46.287 --> 01:15:50.508]  And how do we wake the country up and say no to this plan without it becoming violent?
[01:15:50.548 --> 01:15:51.788]  Because we don't want it to be violent.
[01:15:51.828 --> 01:15:53.488]  We're going to win the midterms.
[01:15:54.209 --> 01:15:55.729]  We're going to take things back peacefully.
[01:15:55.769 --> 01:15:58.630]  They're not going to let us do that.
[01:15:58.750 --> 01:16:00.750]  They're going to stage events and blame us for it.
[01:16:00.770 --> 01:16:02.290]  They're already prepping everybody.
[01:16:02.330 --> 01:16:04.211]  This is not even 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[01:16:04.271 --> 01:16:05.271]  This is a fact.
[01:16:06.277 --> 01:16:07.879]  Prima facie, right there.
[01:16:09.541 --> 01:16:16.190]  And so, they want a war with us because they think they're going to have a war between the police and the military and the American people.
[01:16:16.690 --> 01:16:19.194]  And then they're going to sit back and then watch us all kill each other.
[01:16:20.782 --> 01:16:22.144]  How do we circumvent that?
[01:16:22.464 --> 01:16:23.525]  How do we not go there?
[01:16:24.266 --> 01:16:25.607]  Toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[01:16:25.627 --> 01:16:25.808]  877-789-Alex.
[01:16:25.828 --> 01:16:26.008]  877-789-Alex.
[01:16:26.028 --> 01:16:26.068]  877-789-2539.
[01:16:26.088 --> 01:16:27.369]  And we will get you up and on the air.
[01:16:42.051 --> 01:16:42.992]  I really want to hear from you.
[01:16:43.012 --> 01:16:43.952]  I respect your views.
[01:16:44.412 --> 01:16:54.318]  I want to understand what you are concerned about and just where we go, because I just have this burning desire to expose this, this burning desire to expose what's happening and try to stop it.
[01:16:54.859 --> 01:16:59.321]  That's why I'm going to have a bunch of huge guests that we start taping with today.
[01:17:00.242 --> 01:17:03.284]  Probably going to be a five-hour, basically commercial-free.
[01:17:03.304 --> 01:17:06.406]  We'll take a few breaks, but it's not going to be commercials for stations.
[01:17:07.554 --> 01:17:10.175]  That'll also be sent out at 2 p.m.
[01:17:10.195 --> 01:17:10.555]  tomorrow.
[01:17:10.975 --> 01:17:14.017]  It'll go out, taped to air, like it's live, teleprompter free.
[01:17:15.437 --> 01:17:19.039]  And it's going to be Dr. Steve Pacinic will make his return.
[01:17:19.979 --> 01:17:21.219]  We're going to have Robert Barnes.
[01:17:22.540 --> 01:17:27.902]  We're going to have, just like the constitutional lawyer you just heard from, people like that.
[01:17:28.282 --> 01:17:29.383]  We got a bunch of big guests.
[01:17:30.365 --> 01:17:34.586]  We're not going to announce until they're done and it's taped and it's ready.
[01:17:35.426 --> 01:17:40.267]  But you heard the big revolver journalist on with the rest of the story.
[01:17:40.327 --> 01:17:50.829]  It's going to be four or five hours of that that we will have ready to go on air with tomorrow at 2 p.m.
[01:17:51.249 --> 01:17:53.249]  Central Standard Time.
[01:17:54.049 --> 01:17:56.910]  So to the crew in there, that's the airtime tomorrow, 2 p.m.
[01:17:57.110 --> 01:17:57.470]  Central
[01:17:58.925 --> 01:18:00.107]  Standard time.
[01:18:01.689 --> 01:18:04.013]  And we're going to be putting that report out.
[01:18:04.654 --> 01:18:08.380]  I had Nick Fuentes and others on.
[01:18:10.663 --> 01:18:13.487]  Some of the former political prisoners like Pete Santilli.
[01:18:14.807 --> 01:18:17.448]  Who's a treasure trove of experience and knowledge.
[01:18:17.808 --> 01:18:18.428]  He's been through it.
[01:18:19.249 --> 01:18:21.189]  Saying we need to get Tucker Carlson to go public.
[01:18:21.209 --> 01:18:23.050]  We need to get everybody to expose what's happening.
[01:18:23.070 --> 01:18:30.573]  We need a big expose to show FBI history and involvement in January 6.
[01:18:31.433 --> 01:18:33.314]  Of course, I knew what was already cooking, what was coming.
[01:18:33.334 --> 01:18:34.854]  So that was really a prelude to that.
[01:18:34.874 --> 01:18:38.615]  I'm going to give you a prelude to what's going to break next week.
[01:18:39.116 --> 01:18:40.316]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:18:40.816 --> 01:18:41.756]  That is coming up.
[01:18:41.776 --> 01:18:42.857]  We'll be right back with your phone calls.
[01:18:45.589 --> 01:18:48.170]  All right, I'm going to start going to your phone calls here in just a few minutes.
[01:18:48.230 --> 01:18:54.551]  I want to hit this news from the COVID file.
[01:18:56.432 --> 01:19:04.334]  But it's just really painful to see the federal government seized by globalists, seized by foreign interests that had bought the government off, bought the country off.
[01:19:04.914 --> 01:19:08.055]  We put a president in to try to stand up for the nation, try to do the best job he could.
[01:19:08.095 --> 01:19:09.175]  They removed him through fraud.
[01:19:10.233 --> 01:19:15.416]  And now they think they'll just start a civil war to get control of the rest of the country that won't submit to them.
[01:19:16.577 --> 01:19:25.603]  And to watch these occupiers dismantle the country in front of us with every level of classical tyranny.
[01:19:26.023 --> 01:19:27.924]  I mean, everything's like cartoon level.
[01:19:28.724 --> 01:19:35.689]  Everything's like exaggerated, flagrant, living color, way worse than it's ever been anywhere else.
[01:19:37.563 --> 01:19:50.151]  Except for the mass arrests and mass killing, and then now they're announcing they want that, and Frank Figliuzzi and all of them are on TV saying, our opposition are terrorists, anyone radicalizing anyone, anyone questioning an election is a terrorist.
[01:19:51.932 --> 01:19:55.695]  We're going to get you, we're going to interdict you, we're going to take members of Congress out.
[01:19:59.317 --> 01:20:04.080]  And then of course there's a suspicious object, the CIA headquarters, they can all freak out and panic.
[01:20:06.906 --> 01:20:09.307]  It's the intelligence agencies taking the country over.
[01:20:11.368 --> 01:20:14.690]  And if we can't get control of them, this nation's a joke.
[01:20:15.650 --> 01:20:17.971]  And by the way, China and Russia know we're a joke.
[01:20:19.352 --> 01:20:21.213]  They can only bully Americans.
[01:20:21.493 --> 01:20:23.234]  They can't stand up to any real foreign powers.
[01:20:25.215 --> 01:20:28.917]  It's banana, boat, garbage.
[01:20:32.599 --> 01:20:33.079]  That's what it is.
[01:20:36.533 --> 01:20:46.796]  In fact, you know, I mentioned it, but the Figoliuzzi thing is so big, I'm just going to play it again, because it blew the judge away when I had Judge Joe Brown here a week and a half ago as well, because it's so seismic.
[01:20:47.816 --> 01:20:57.459]  And the whole clip, he goes on, you know, just to declare war on America, and that questioning them is radicalization, and the penalty for radicalization is death.
[01:20:58.079 --> 01:21:00.880]  So when you know the nomenclature, the terms used by the military,
[01:21:02.201 --> 01:21:06.822]  And then you have the new national threat response package.
[01:21:06.862 --> 01:21:11.783]  You have the statements by the CIA and FBI that indeed their new mission is fighting us.
[01:21:12.564 --> 01:21:23.506]  We pay their paycheck, they open our borders, they smuggle children, they devalue the currency, they protect the pedophile rings, they do all this and then we're the enemy because we don't love it.
[01:21:25.747 --> 01:21:31.068]  We don't love what the sellout lawyers did to this weird consortium of criminals that run the country.
[01:21:34.946 --> 01:21:43.169]  White supremacy, most lethal threat to America, Biden says, and you've got the Secretary of Defense tweeting out the communist black power symbol.
[01:21:43.969 --> 01:21:45.990]  Imagine if a white guy put a white power symbol out.
[01:21:46.190 --> 01:21:46.670]  What does that mean?
[01:21:46.690 --> 01:21:48.271]  It's supposed to just be a red, white, and blue fist.
[01:21:49.451 --> 01:21:58.095]  But no, it's the communist fist on the Secretary of Defense's site, because that's what it's all about is division and tribalism and the breakup of the country.
[01:21:58.115 --> 01:22:04.297]  And that's why he was put in position of power, because he and General Honore said they would do that and would wage war against America.
[01:22:07.570 --> 01:22:08.811]  It's just crazy.
[01:22:09.232 --> 01:22:11.834]  It's like Biden looks like a crazy dictator in his sunglasses.
[01:22:12.354 --> 01:22:13.155]  Looks like Gaddafi.
[01:22:13.175 --> 01:22:15.376]  And it's the same thing with the new Secretary of Defense.
[01:22:15.416 --> 01:22:16.878]  I mean, he looks like a crazy dictator.
[01:22:18.699 --> 01:22:19.440]  Not because he's black.
[01:22:19.500 --> 01:22:20.340]  He just has that look.
[01:22:20.540 --> 01:22:21.941]  Like Biden has the look of a thug.
[01:22:23.062 --> 01:22:24.644]  But then the actions are what matters.
[01:22:25.404 --> 01:22:26.085]  Here's that clip again.
[01:22:27.731 --> 01:22:37.057]  In order to really tackle terrorism, and this time domestically, you've got to attack and dismantle the command and control element of a terrorist group.
[01:22:37.397 --> 01:22:45.783]  And unfortunately, and I know this is painful to hear, that may mean people sitting in Congress right now, people in and around the former president.
[01:22:46.243 --> 01:22:47.284]  That's how you do this.
[01:22:47.404 --> 01:22:54.669]  Otherwise, recruitment, inciting, and cult-like leadership continues to recruit people to violence.
[01:22:57.782 --> 01:23:03.284]  And I guess I could play a two-minute compilation of Psaki and Biden and all of them saying the same thing.
[01:23:03.484 --> 01:23:05.125]  It's just, you already know what's happening.
[01:23:10.888 --> 01:23:12.908]  Oh, yeah, it's not just a black power fist.
[01:23:13.009 --> 01:23:14.349]  It's an Africa fist.
[01:23:16.990 --> 01:23:24.593]  When the globalists are massively engaged in all sorts of enslavement in Africa right now, not a word out of him about Apple and slave factories in China.
[01:23:25.494 --> 01:23:25.614]  No.
[01:23:28.550 --> 01:23:32.612]  It's like, hey, we're criminals, we're the government, and we love black people, so we can do whatever we want.
[01:23:32.632 --> 01:23:34.953]  It has nothing to do with reality.
[01:23:36.673 --> 01:23:36.973]  You know what?
[01:23:37.013 --> 01:23:43.856]  I'm going to hit the COVID news with Max Keiser, and I'll tie that into the other big news.
[01:23:44.756 --> 01:23:48.918]  And then I'll also hit a lot of this news that's breaking tomorrow during this four or five-hour special I'm going to tape.
[01:23:49.498 --> 01:23:50.359]  That's going to air at 2 p.m.
[01:23:50.379 --> 01:23:50.659]  Central.
[01:23:50.679 --> 01:23:51.119]  But right now,
[01:23:53.971 --> 01:23:56.433]  Just briefly, it ends on Monday morning.
[01:23:56.593 --> 01:24:03.278]  It is the vitamin C with the zinc and the rose hips that you cannot do better for your immune system and your body.
[01:24:03.298 --> 01:24:05.459]  It's 1100% of the vitamin C you need.
[01:24:06.020 --> 01:24:09.963]  It's almost 200% of the zinc you need and the rose hips are amazing as well.
[01:24:10.763 --> 01:24:11.524]  It's all in there.
[01:24:11.664 --> 01:24:17.311]  It's the Linus Pauling recipe that you won the Nobel Prize for, basically, and it's at a very low price for what you're getting.
[01:24:17.351 --> 01:24:23.057]  You also have the whole food vitamin, and it's from Whole Foods, multivitamin, and you have the vitamin D3 with calcium.
[01:24:23.298 --> 01:24:24.479]  It's good for adults and children.
[01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:27.362]  That's all 40% off, free shipping, double patriot points.
[01:24:27.402 --> 01:24:28.023]  That ends Monday.

[01:24:59.676 --> 01:25:02.057]  I hope we tried to call back any of the folks that were still on hold yesterday.
[01:25:02.618 --> 01:25:05.019]  Simon, Dishwan, and others.
[01:25:05.519 --> 01:25:07.119]  Who's been holding longest here?
[01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:15.563]  That would be Matthew in Florida, avoiding the deep state false flags, exposing their traps.
[01:25:15.603 --> 01:25:16.443]  How do we do that, Matthew?
[01:25:17.404 --> 01:25:21.505]  Hey Alex, this is Mr. Foote, not Matthew in Florida.
[01:25:21.625 --> 01:25:22.586]  I had to lie to the
[01:25:24.165 --> 01:25:26.888]  Let's stop you right there.
[01:25:27.028 --> 01:25:28.650]  Let's just stop you right there.
[01:25:30.371 --> 01:25:34.535]  We don't screen the phone calls other than you having a clean phone line and having your point you want to make.
[01:25:35.216 --> 01:25:39.860]  So, uh, why would you have to lie and say your name is Matthew instead of what?
[01:25:40.981 --> 01:25:41.842]  Mr. Foote.
[01:25:42.743 --> 01:25:43.564]  This is Mr. Foote.
[01:25:43.744 --> 01:25:47.627]  Okay, Mr. Foote, go ahead and make your point, but I'm not going to indulge in this very long.
[01:25:47.667 --> 01:25:47.928]  Go ahead.
[01:25:48.775 --> 01:25:49.115]  Okay.
[01:25:49.936 --> 01:26:01.202]  Anyway, I just wanted to start out with a quick plug and say that InfoWars store has t-shirts and that they sell for a price and can be bought online.
[01:26:02.243 --> 01:26:13.549]  And I wanted to say that really everything just fell apart for you and this because you're missing one thing and that thing is a foil.
[01:26:15.321 --> 01:26:18.202]  But your foil needs to be real.
[01:26:19.302 --> 01:26:22.503]  Somebody that you can face.
[01:26:22.543 --> 01:26:24.483]  This sounds like a bunch of riddle stuff, man.
[01:26:25.103 --> 01:26:25.883]  I'm not the riddler.
[01:26:25.903 --> 01:26:26.603]  I appreciate your call.
[01:26:26.683 --> 01:26:27.284]  Look, here's the deal.
[01:26:27.784 --> 01:26:28.824]  We don't screen your calls.
[01:26:28.844 --> 01:26:30.804]  Other than you've got a clean phone line, you've got something to say.
[01:26:31.544 --> 01:26:36.365]  I'm not going to, but liberals, they want to play weird games and act like they're smarter than everybody.
[01:26:36.385 --> 01:26:38.906]  If I don't understand what you're saying, I'm going to hang up on you.
[01:26:39.806 --> 01:26:41.827]  Okay, because it sounds like a bunch of gibberish to me.
[01:26:42.567 --> 01:26:43.767]  Okay, who's up next here?
[01:26:45.233 --> 01:26:47.934]  Let's go ahead and talk to Charles in Maryland.
[01:26:47.974 --> 01:26:48.714]  Charles, welcome.
[01:26:51.035 --> 01:26:51.215]  Yeah.
[01:26:51.255 --> 01:26:51.875]  Hi, Alex.
[01:26:52.516 --> 01:26:57.618]  I'm so grateful to have you and everybody at InfoWars on the air.
[01:26:57.718 --> 01:27:02.419]  I'm just so thankful that you and people like Tucker Carlson out there fighting, fighting for us.
[01:27:03.100 --> 01:27:03.540]  Thank you, sir.
[01:27:05.020 --> 01:27:12.343]  I just took a Survival Shield X2 and drank some fizzy magnesium, magnesium, and I'm feeling great.
[01:27:13.488 --> 01:27:18.930]  And my Info Wars Save the Frog shirt came in the mail two days ago.
[01:27:19.230 --> 01:27:23.132]  Well, without you we wouldn't be on the air, sir, so I salute you and I thank you.
[01:27:24.112 --> 01:27:25.733]  What is your take on January 6th?
[01:27:25.953 --> 01:27:28.074]  I see you say that you want to talk about that.
[01:27:29.634 --> 01:27:31.455]  Yeah, yeah, I do.
[01:27:31.515 --> 01:27:42.519]  There's so many disturbing things in the world right now and I can't get away from it at all, but I would have to say that the number one thing that bothers me more than anything right now
[01:27:43.337 --> 01:27:49.220]  It's those people sitting in jail right now from the state insurrection on January 6th.
[01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:51.081]  It really, really bothers me.
[01:27:51.761 --> 01:27:58.424]  And we don't have politicians doing nearly enough to get them out and have due process.
[01:27:58.444 --> 01:27:59.745]  Well, that's because D.C.
[01:27:59.765 --> 01:28:02.366]  has its own nightmare judges, its own nightmare system.
[01:28:02.406 --> 01:28:03.147]  And D.C.
[01:28:03.207 --> 01:28:03.927]  is not America.
[01:28:03.967 --> 01:28:04.227]  D.C.
[01:28:04.267 --> 01:28:05.388]  is basically North Korea.
[01:28:06.008 --> 01:28:08.369]  It's a Jeezy Pim's toehold.
[01:28:09.730 --> 01:28:10.910]  Oh yeah, I totally agree.
[01:28:12.509 --> 01:28:15.530]  Probably even worse than North Korea in many ways, you know?
[01:28:15.550 --> 01:28:18.711]  It's like the hub of the whole globalist operation.
[01:28:20.532 --> 01:28:28.015]  But, um, you know, the fact that they're sitting in jail with no due process is just unacceptable.
[01:28:28.135 --> 01:28:28.595]  Stay there.
[01:28:28.735 --> 01:28:29.695]  I'm back in two minutes, Charles.
[01:28:29.715 --> 01:28:37.618]  I'm gonna go right back to you and then I'm gonna go to Al Killer and everybody else that is patiently holding on this Friday live transmission.
[01:28:38.199 --> 01:28:40.339]  Again, if you disagree with me, just get to it.
[01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:41.520]  I'm not censoring you.
[01:28:42.795 --> 01:28:46.050]  All that evil men and tyrants need to flourish is that good men do nothing.
[01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:48.321]  Well, I'm trying to be a good man.
[01:28:48.361 --> 01:28:49.641]  I'm trying to stand up and do the right thing.
[01:28:49.681 --> 01:28:54.184]  And I've seen huge effects with what we've done here at InfoWars.
[01:28:54.764 --> 01:28:59.146]  Other good men and women getting together and telling the truth and standing up to corruption.
[01:28:59.766 --> 01:29:01.067]  But now the globals are coming after us.
[01:29:01.587 --> 01:29:02.828]  And so I need your prayers.
[01:29:02.888 --> 01:29:03.908]  I need your financial support.
[01:29:04.288 --> 01:29:06.029]  I need your word of mouth to stay in the fight.
[01:29:06.049 --> 01:29:08.010]  We've got a big sale going right now.
[01:29:08.330 --> 01:29:11.112]  Free shipping, double patriot points on three items that have been sold out.

[01:29:27.784 --> 01:29:29.025]  It is you that has spread the word.
[01:29:29.085 --> 01:29:32.528]  It is you that have built this operation and we're now needed more than ever.

[01:29:42.904 --> 01:29:55.551]  In the FBI's view, the top domestic violent extremist threat comes from racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists, specifically those who advocate for the superiority of the white race.
[01:29:55.711 --> 01:29:57.252]  According to the intelligence community,
[01:29:58.372 --> 01:30:03.756]  Terrorism from white supremacy is the most lethal threat to the homeland today.
[01:30:03.816 --> 01:30:09.440]  Because of this growth in polarization in the United States and domestic violence in white supremacist groups.
[01:30:10.200 --> 01:30:16.805]  So I know looking forward that the members of the Biden team who have been nominated or have been appointed.
[01:30:17.735 --> 01:30:17.815]  Yes.
[01:30:36.980 --> 01:30:39.241]  Really tackle terrorism, and this time domestically.
[01:30:39.541 --> 01:30:45.483]  You've got to attack and dismantle the command and control element of a terrorist group.
[01:30:45.803 --> 01:30:54.187]  And unfortunately, and I know this is painful to hear, that may mean people sitting in Congress right now, people in and around the former president.
[01:30:54.647 --> 01:30:55.707]  That's how you do this.
[01:30:55.807 --> 01:31:03.070]  Otherwise, recruitment, inciting, and cult-like leadership continues to recruit people to violence.
[01:31:03.470 --> 01:31:06.972]  Our initial work on DVE will broadly fall into three areas.
[01:31:07.413 --> 01:31:18.860]  The first is a tasking from President Biden sent to the ODNI today, requesting a comprehensive threat assessment coordinated with the FBI and DHS on domestic violent extremism.
[01:31:19.441 --> 01:31:33.050]  You can be darn tootin' that we are focused very, very hard on how can we get better sources, better information, better analysis, so that we can make sure that something like what happened on January 6th never happens again.
[01:31:33.790 --> 01:31:40.194]  You can be darn tootin', the FBI director's gonna make sure we get sold out to China and the pedophiles and everything else.
[01:31:42.515 --> 01:31:46.577]  That's their job, is to just hold the position, hold down America while the vampire sucks us dry.
[01:31:47.938 --> 01:31:53.180]  The national security apparatus is a straitjacket to keep us tied down while the country is destroyed.
[01:31:53.201 --> 01:31:54.621]  You see it everywhere.
[01:31:56.942 --> 01:31:58.043]  What a group of monsters.
[01:31:58.303 --> 01:31:59.524]  And then imagine that statement.
[01:32:00.549 --> 01:32:01.069]  Out of all of them.
[01:32:01.249 --> 01:32:03.470]  Oh, we got to frustrate these terror networks.
[01:32:04.091 --> 01:32:11.274]  Trump's existence and the people around him and the talk show host and Congress, they've got to be gotten rid of.
[01:32:11.634 --> 01:32:13.755]  Oh, because people want to elect them.
[01:32:14.215 --> 01:32:15.676]  People want to listen to them.
[01:32:16.156 --> 01:32:18.917]  These evil Americans like Alex Jones.
[01:32:20.478 --> 01:32:22.039]  They like Tucker Carlson.
[01:32:22.939 --> 01:32:24.380]  They like President Trump.
[01:32:25.410 --> 01:32:26.750]  They like free market.
[01:32:27.130 --> 01:32:28.331]  They like babies.
[01:32:28.391 --> 01:32:29.391]  They like guns.
[01:32:29.731 --> 01:32:30.891]  They like Jesus.
[01:32:31.071 --> 01:32:32.172]  No, no, no.
[01:32:32.612 --> 01:32:34.432]  You get drag queen story time.
[01:32:35.813 --> 01:32:37.953]  You get smuggled and kidnapped little kids.
[01:32:38.873 --> 01:32:40.214]  You get devalued currency.
[01:32:40.254 --> 01:32:41.254]  You get world government.
[01:32:41.694 --> 01:32:44.335]  You get fentanyl shipped in.
[01:32:44.395 --> 01:32:45.435]  You don't get that.
[01:32:45.555 --> 01:32:46.695]  No, no, no.
[01:32:47.515 --> 01:32:48.996]  We're the liberal masters.
[01:32:50.656 --> 01:32:53.497]  Charles, finish up your point about January 6th and where this is going.
[01:32:57.392 --> 01:33:05.354]  The vast majority of the people that went in on January 6th were some of the best patriots that we have.
[01:33:05.954 --> 01:33:11.035]  You know, they just got duped into going in there and being waved in by FBI and the cops and whatnot.
[01:33:11.095 --> 01:33:16.076]  Most of them walked through the velvet ropes, did nothing wrong, causing no violence.
[01:33:17.036 --> 01:33:23.957]  And, you know, these are incredible patriots, and I want to see something else done to try to get them out.
[01:33:24.137 --> 01:33:24.558]  I agree.
[01:33:24.598 --> 01:33:26.038]  I'd like to see George Soros
[01:33:27.591 --> 01:33:31.813]  And I'd like to see Bill Gates and all them in solitary confinement.
[01:33:31.833 --> 01:33:33.074]  I mean, they deserve it.
[01:33:35.255 --> 01:33:35.775]  Oh, yeah.
[01:33:35.835 --> 01:33:36.036]  Yeah.
[01:33:36.076 --> 01:33:39.758]  Just just for starters, you know, so we can get them tried and convicted.
[01:33:39.838 --> 01:33:43.460]  And I have a few thoughts of what, you know, the penalty would be.
[01:33:43.500 --> 01:33:51.444]  But, yeah, they're the ones who truly behind should be behind bars right now, not the not the patriots.
[01:33:51.504 --> 01:33:55.286]  What do you think about having a rally
[01:33:56.485 --> 01:34:06.208]  You know, like we did with the Stop the Steals, but just having a very peaceful, peaceful rally, talking about due process, getting many, many thousands of patriots there.
[01:34:08.290 --> 01:34:13.673]  Well, I think President Trump should have another rally in D.C.
[01:34:14.013 --> 01:34:18.156]  and make it all about how we're not going to be provocateured, we're not going to be violent, and we're against antifa.
[01:34:18.216 --> 01:34:20.337]  I think we should have a peaceful rally in D.C.
[01:34:20.377 --> 01:34:21.378]  for those that are held captive.
[01:34:21.418 --> 01:34:21.638]  I agree.
[01:34:21.658 --> 01:34:29.003]  Instead of running from September, instead of running from January 6th, we need to run towards it and expose the globalist role.
[01:34:30.913 --> 01:34:40.120]  We got some really big guests tomorrow in the special Saturday transmission I'm going to tape today and tomorrow with like five, six guests that's going to air commercial-free.
[01:34:40.140 --> 01:34:43.222]  There'll be a few breaks, but we're not going to run the regular commercial ads.
[01:34:43.242 --> 01:34:56.111]  I think we had like a three-hour show last weekend, like five minutes was ads, but the point is, it's going to be a very powerful transmission this Saturday, 2 p.m.
[01:34:56.151 --> 01:34:56.912]  Central, 3 p.m.
[01:34:56.932 --> 01:34:57.232]  Eastern.
[01:34:59.531 --> 01:35:00.571]  That you're not going to want to miss.
[01:35:00.651 --> 01:35:12.634]  Now, I was given information that I'm not going to cover until Max Keiser joins us at the bottom of the hour.
[01:35:14.114 --> 01:35:19.295]  And I want to ask the great intrepid crew, because the book's been out of print forever, but I know there's one around here.
[01:35:21.175 --> 01:35:25.116]  My book, 9-11 Dissent and Tyranny, has this in it.
[01:35:29.011 --> 01:35:30.272]  I'll cover it, bottom of the hour.
[01:35:33.314 --> 01:35:46.962]  They are now announcing matrix pods that people will put their bodies into and the government is talking about it being punishment for you and your family.
[01:35:53.366 --> 01:35:54.366]  If we don't start
[01:35:55.501 --> 01:35:58.642]  Caring about humanity and giving babies value and old people value?
[01:35:59.102 --> 01:36:00.322]  Do you think any of us are safe?
[01:36:00.362 --> 01:36:07.704]  You have to understand, there is a desire by the globalists to basically rip and tear humans apart.
[01:36:10.105 --> 01:36:11.965]  We've got to oppose these psychotics.
[01:36:12.005 --> 01:36:15.486]  They want to rape and attack everything you can imagine.
[01:36:18.587 --> 01:36:21.607]  I told you the Pentagon back in the 70s had a plan.
[01:36:21.627 --> 01:36:22.247]  We're already going there.
[01:36:22.267 --> 01:36:24.288]  I'll do it at the bottom of the hour.
[01:36:25.947 --> 01:36:32.468]  Put us in tanks from birth to then feed us a virtual reality, because the argument would be, as well, our brains all that matters.
[01:36:32.488 --> 01:36:33.868]  Who cares if our body isn't real?
[01:36:34.509 --> 01:36:38.189]  So that no violence would ever be allowed, because basically you're born into a video game.
[01:36:39.789 --> 01:36:41.450]  It's total enslavement.
[01:36:41.530 --> 01:36:43.350]  It's prison to the next level.
[01:36:44.170 --> 01:36:50.751]  And so you see the Matrix, 1999, that was all a Pentagon plan.
[01:36:52.252 --> 01:36:53.952]  You can say, well, plans are like
[01:36:55.205 --> 01:36:56.526]  Rear ends, everybody's got one.
[01:36:57.066 --> 01:37:01.490]  Yeah, but this group at DARPA had the plan for the internet as well, and they got it.
[01:37:01.550 --> 01:37:05.192]  So, it's just total nightmare, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:37:05.293 --> 01:37:07.234]  And I mean, it's never going to stop.
[01:37:08.375 --> 01:37:13.999]  They want to artificially cut off everything that's real that works to force us into the new system they're setting up.
[01:37:14.359 --> 01:37:16.981]  I'll talk about it with Max Keiser, bottom of the hour.
[01:37:17.001 --> 01:37:19.043]  Let's go back to your phone calls and move quickly here.
[01:37:21.425 --> 01:37:23.306]  Aaron, thank you for letting us call you back.
[01:37:23.326 --> 01:37:24.326]  You were left on hold yesterday.
[01:37:24.346 --> 01:37:25.187]  We appreciate you.
[01:37:25.747 --> 01:37:27.208]  South Carolina, go ahead.
[01:37:27.228 --> 01:37:27.688]  You're on the air.
[01:37:28.948 --> 01:37:29.549]  You're welcome.
[01:37:29.929 --> 01:37:32.250]  I was there with you January 6th.
[01:37:32.650 --> 01:37:34.411]  We exchanged a couple of God Blessings.
[01:37:35.371 --> 01:37:36.552]  I've got a question for you.
[01:37:36.572 --> 01:37:38.673]  I promise I'm going somewhere with the question.
[01:37:38.773 --> 01:37:41.054]  And then if you want me to plug, I can do that as well.
[01:37:42.154 --> 01:37:46.016]  My question, Alex, have you seen any of the Chosen shows?
[01:37:46.036 --> 01:37:48.497]  The ones about Jesus that have been coming out recently?
[01:37:49.813 --> 01:37:50.593]  No, I'll be honest.
[01:37:50.673 --> 01:37:52.594]  I mean, I watch very little TV.
[01:37:53.235 --> 01:37:53.975]  Okay, listen.
[01:37:54.835 --> 01:38:01.418]  I would encourage you to watch the last one, five or six, but it's about John the Baptist and Jesus.
[01:38:01.438 --> 01:38:02.899]  They're having this conversation.
[01:38:04.039 --> 01:38:06.160]  John's talking about what he has to do.
[01:38:06.300 --> 01:38:07.761]  He has to go confront Herod.
[01:38:08.621 --> 01:38:09.162]  He has to.
[01:38:10.122 --> 01:38:14.724]  And while he's doing that, Jesus knows, man, this is the last time I'm going to see my cousin.
[01:38:14.784 --> 01:38:15.745]  He's about to get killed.
[01:38:16.365 --> 01:38:18.346]  So he tells him, John,
[01:38:18.931 --> 01:38:20.472]  I know you're going to do what you're going to do.
[01:38:20.572 --> 01:38:22.293]  Just listen to God as you do it.
[01:38:24.374 --> 01:38:25.834]  I think that's a message for you, man.
[01:38:26.195 --> 01:38:31.697]  Alex, I really believe that you're a prophet to the United States of America, possibly the world.
[01:38:32.978 --> 01:38:36.219]  And it's really important that you listen to God.
[01:38:36.900 --> 01:38:37.800]  You do it His way.
[01:38:37.860 --> 01:38:39.201]  The stakes are so high right now.
[01:38:39.701 --> 01:38:40.301]  Well, don't worry.
[01:38:40.402 --> 01:38:40.782]  I am.
[01:38:41.042 --> 01:38:42.162]  My God's telling me attack.
[01:38:42.883 --> 01:38:44.163]  God's telling me go full speed.
[01:38:44.904 --> 01:38:45.184]  Okay.
[01:38:45.544 --> 01:38:45.804]  Okay.
[01:38:45.964 --> 01:38:46.424]  That's cool.
[01:38:46.905 --> 01:38:47.405]  And listen,
[01:38:48.362 --> 01:38:49.103]  I'll stand with you.
[01:38:49.403 --> 01:38:50.384]  I stand with you, brother.
[01:38:50.624 --> 01:39:00.014]  And in fact, another thing I wanted to say, every single person listening right now, every single person, go to the website, go to InfoWars.
[01:39:00.274 --> 01:39:04.979]  If all you can donate is a dollar, just give something today.
[01:39:07.142 --> 01:39:12.686]  Well, that's my only concern is they won't be smart if they, and I'm not comparing myself to John the Baptist, but everything's an archetype of that.
[01:39:13.526 --> 01:39:18.590]  That's why so many patriots, they kill them and their family to blame the person for killing their family.
[01:39:18.690 --> 01:39:21.712]  I would never kill my family, and that's the type of thing they would pull.
[01:39:21.792 --> 01:39:26.095]  So they're going to want to try to kill me in a discrediting way.
[01:39:27.279 --> 01:39:30.402]  So that's why, I mean, I'm a pretty straight-laced guy.
[01:39:30.442 --> 01:39:32.024]  There's not really any way to do that.
[01:39:32.324 --> 01:39:33.625]  I'm not speaking that over you.
[01:39:33.645 --> 01:39:34.927]  I don't want that to happen.
[01:39:34.967 --> 01:39:35.747]  No, no, no.
[01:39:36.008 --> 01:39:36.708]  It needs to be said.
[01:39:37.189 --> 01:39:38.150]  Believe me, we're in the season.
[01:39:38.310 --> 01:39:38.930]  Are you kidding?
[01:39:39.551 --> 01:39:40.752]  They want me dead so bad?
[01:39:41.153 --> 01:39:42.274]  We have crippled them.
[01:39:42.654 --> 01:39:47.178]  This broadcast, all you listeners together, they know we are the big enemy.
[01:39:47.839 --> 01:39:49.820]  And we've already inspired so many other people.
[01:39:49.840 --> 01:39:53.463]  Like I told everybody, Joe Rogan's about to get super hardcore six months ago.
[01:39:53.823 --> 01:39:55.024]  People thought I was making it up.
[01:39:55.064 --> 01:39:56.245]  Now Joe's super hardcore.
[01:39:57.106 --> 01:40:00.888]  And I'm going to not name other names, but it's been all of us together that have done this.
[01:40:01.849 --> 01:40:07.393]  And so I've always seen our job as prepping and driving the next big awakening.
[01:40:07.873 --> 01:40:18.036]  And I can now sit back and see our success together, because all of you are just as important as I am, is that we have influenced the entire resistance movement and the main opposition.
[01:40:18.056 --> 01:40:18.796]  So it's a beautiful time.
[01:40:19.076 --> 01:40:20.236]  What else did you want to say, brother?
[01:40:21.437 --> 01:40:24.197]  Hey, everybody listening, get on the phone with your representatives.
[01:40:24.977 --> 01:40:25.638]  Get on there.
[01:40:25.718 --> 01:40:27.438]  Tell them about the FBI.
[01:40:27.478 --> 01:40:28.658]  They need to be investigated.
[01:40:28.738 --> 01:40:30.519]  So let's put some pressure on these people.
[01:40:31.297 --> 01:40:32.517]  Let's stay at peace, brother.
[01:40:32.537 --> 01:40:34.558]  Listen, I'm with you, man.
[01:40:34.598 --> 01:40:35.779]  I'm glad you're doing what you're doing.
[01:40:35.799 --> 01:40:36.319]  I love you.
[01:40:37.079 --> 01:40:37.900]  I love you too, brother.
[01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:38.460]  I appreciate you.
[01:40:38.740 --> 01:40:40.280]  No, I mean, I've said that prayer many times.
[01:40:40.340 --> 01:40:41.661]  God, tell me what you want me to do.
[01:40:42.161 --> 01:40:43.642]  God's like, my whole life, you sure you want it?
[01:40:43.662 --> 01:40:44.282]  You sure you want it?
[01:40:44.602 --> 01:40:47.023]  And every step was like, more pressure, more pressure, more pressure.
[01:40:47.423 --> 01:40:52.025]  And now it's like, I'm not even questioning, but it's like, you asked for this, now do it.
[01:40:52.525 --> 01:40:53.005]  Do it now.
[01:40:55.126 --> 01:41:02.628]  I just want to be the best I can be, and be the strongest, and really deliver as much truth as I can, and attack this thing head-on.
[01:41:02.688 --> 01:41:03.408]  It's a real honor.
[01:41:03.808 --> 01:41:07.109]  I'm not looking forward to whatever it is they're going to do to me, and I just trust in God.
[01:41:07.149 --> 01:41:07.929]  That's all that matters.
[01:41:08.009 --> 01:41:11.270]  But all the flesh has to be burned away, and it will be burned away.
[01:41:12.210 --> 01:41:16.171]  Just every moment of my life, I do not want to be the Attorney General.
[01:41:16.211 --> 01:41:17.411]  I do not want to be the Queen of England.
[01:41:18.803 --> 01:41:20.224]  I do not want to be the globalist.
[01:41:20.244 --> 01:41:25.026]  You know, they're so out of their minds, just toddling around about to be destroyed.
[01:41:25.507 --> 01:41:26.147]  All of it.
[01:41:26.207 --> 01:41:27.548]  I want to be far away from them.
[01:41:27.628 --> 01:41:29.689]  And so I'm right where I want to be.
[01:41:30.049 --> 01:41:31.570]  All right, let's go ahead and take more calls.
[01:41:32.270 --> 01:41:33.331]  Who's up next here?
[01:41:33.391 --> 01:41:36.252]  Let's go to Deshaun in California.
[01:41:36.292 --> 01:41:37.213]  Deshaun, thanks for holding.
[01:41:37.253 --> 01:41:37.553]  Welcome.
[01:41:38.794 --> 01:41:39.454]  All right, Alex.
[01:41:39.494 --> 01:41:40.374]  This is what it is.
[01:41:40.434 --> 01:41:43.176]  This is the next big thing they're going to do.
[01:41:43.196 --> 01:41:44.737]  America is so scared right now.
[01:41:45.057 --> 01:41:47.058]  They're going to fake a nuclear attack on us.
[01:41:47.719 --> 01:41:54.466]  And the people are going to just hide in their house again, and then that's when they're going to bring out their little SS Nazis and come after us.
[01:41:57.069 --> 01:41:58.130]  Is that what your gut's telling you?
[01:41:58.150 --> 01:42:02.515]  Yeah, because I think space alien attack, nuclear attack, anything goes now.
[01:42:04.343 --> 01:42:05.104]  We're good to go.
[01:42:20.856 --> 01:42:21.417]  We're good to go.
[01:42:40.231 --> 01:42:40.831]  I agree with you.
[01:42:40.871 --> 01:42:41.291]  That's the fact.
[01:42:41.331 --> 01:42:42.812]  You're the type of caller I've been looking for.
[01:42:42.832 --> 01:42:45.673]  All the callers are great, but what can they pull?
[01:42:45.813 --> 01:42:51.535]  Yeah, a limited nuclear attack, a cyber lockdown, a fake alien invasion.
[01:42:51.875 --> 01:42:53.616]  I mean, they've all got it already.
[01:42:53.656 --> 01:42:54.316]  What else do you think?
[01:42:55.676 --> 01:42:58.177]  Look guys, another thing I wanted to get at you with is, listen.
[01:42:58.857 --> 01:43:00.878]  Blacks is 13% of the population.
[01:43:01.198 --> 01:43:03.819]  There won't be no race riot, okay?
[01:43:04.119 --> 01:43:06.060]  We just waiting for y'all to rise up.
[01:43:06.500 --> 01:43:07.340]  It's the white man.
[01:43:07.360 --> 01:43:09.001]  You at war with yourself.
[01:43:10.133 --> 01:43:11.874]  No, I get it.
[01:43:12.194 --> 01:43:17.637]  The globalists want to start a war with the globalists attacking Americans and claim it's black people.
[01:43:17.697 --> 01:43:18.557]  I totally agree with you.
[01:43:18.577 --> 01:43:19.058]  It's not true.
[01:43:19.098 --> 01:43:21.859]  Yeah, but like, but like, no, but y'all have to worry about yourself.
[01:43:21.879 --> 01:43:24.060]  This is falling like, like Europe and like Rome.
[01:43:25.281 --> 01:43:27.462]  You got some evil leaders at the top and they white.
[01:43:27.782 --> 01:43:29.643]  And like I said, they want to kill y'all off too.
[01:43:30.023 --> 01:43:33.605]  So Joe Biden is the bloods and y'all guys are the crypts.
[01:43:34.085 --> 01:43:38.227]  Y'all gonna have to collide with each other, period, to save this republic, man.
[01:43:38.647 --> 01:43:40.667]  And like I said, it ain't about the black and white issue.
[01:43:41.027 --> 01:43:45.089]  We know what's going on, and a lot of blacks is knowing they waking up to it.
[01:43:45.489 --> 01:43:46.329]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:43:46.349 --> 01:43:48.370]  But it's up to the white man, it's up to y'all.
[01:43:49.847 --> 01:43:53.089]  Brother, I think it's up to all of us to show, but I love you, and I appreciate you.
[01:43:53.149 --> 01:43:53.909]  Powerful caller.
[01:43:54.489 --> 01:43:54.769]  Wow!
[01:43:54.809 --> 01:43:56.150]  That's why I need to take more calls.
[01:43:56.990 --> 01:43:58.791]  And tomorrow, I'm taking a bunch of calls.
[01:43:58.851 --> 01:44:01.272]  I got five guests set up so far.
[01:44:02.253 --> 01:44:02.893]  Five of them.
[01:44:02.993 --> 01:44:03.653]  Big guest.
[01:44:04.294 --> 01:44:04.574]  2 p.m.
[01:44:04.594 --> 01:44:05.454]  tomorrow, you're gonna hear them.
[01:44:05.975 --> 01:44:06.255]  Wow!
[01:44:06.315 --> 01:44:07.555]  I appreciate the crew doing a great job.
[01:44:07.575 --> 01:44:07.935]  Stay with us.
[01:44:09.536 --> 01:44:10.897]  The globalists think they're gonna win.
[01:44:12.197 --> 01:44:12.858]  They're not gonna win.
[01:44:13.772 --> 01:44:15.353]  Some of the big articles on InfoWars.com.
[01:44:15.393 --> 01:44:20.755]  Comedian Jimmy Dore still suffering from side effects of two months after Moderna jabs.
[01:44:21.415 --> 01:44:22.056]  Heart problems.
[01:44:23.596 --> 01:44:24.497]  Healthy guy before that.
[01:44:25.757 --> 01:44:27.098]  And hardly walk up the stairs now.
[01:44:28.259 --> 01:44:30.059]  Holocaust survivor warms great reset.
[01:44:30.139 --> 01:44:31.620]  Worse than Hitler's master plan.
[01:44:32.180 --> 01:44:32.981]  This is global.
[01:44:33.021 --> 01:44:35.182]  We've got all that coming up today.
[01:44:36.522 --> 01:44:42.465]  InfoWars.com is the main site to spread the light.
[01:44:44.175 --> 01:44:47.918]  Let's go to who's been home the longest here.
[01:44:47.938 --> 01:44:48.398]  Let me look.
[01:44:48.638 --> 01:44:50.840]  Owl Killer in Virginia.
[01:44:50.860 --> 01:44:52.661]  That's a caller been calling for 20 years.
[01:44:53.181 --> 01:44:54.242]  Owl Killer, welcome, sir.
[01:44:55.563 --> 01:44:59.085]  So, Alex, first off, I want to give you some product placement.
[01:44:59.465 --> 01:45:03.708]  Everybody that's looking for a blast from the past, you might want to check out Dr. Jones Naturals.
[01:45:03.748 --> 01:45:05.369]  That's all I'm going to say on that.
[01:45:05.389 --> 01:45:06.750]  Your mouth will thank you for it.
[01:45:08.231 --> 01:45:12.412]  I have a question regarding the Vitamin Mineral Fusion and the new multivitamin you came out.
[01:45:12.512 --> 01:45:13.813]  Which one do you use?
[01:45:13.833 --> 01:45:15.613]  Because I just bought the three-pack.
[01:45:15.653 --> 01:45:19.334]  I want to know which one you think is better in the total before I go to my point.
[01:45:20.134 --> 01:45:21.355]  They're all three different things.
[01:45:21.435 --> 01:45:23.295]  I just went out and said, there's a market for this.
[01:45:23.335 --> 01:45:23.955]  It works good.
[01:45:23.975 --> 01:45:25.656]  And they're all three different things.
[01:45:25.736 --> 01:45:27.876]  If I was going to take one of them, I'd take the multivitamin.
[01:45:28.797 --> 01:45:29.997]  But the vitamin C is incredible.
[01:45:30.757 --> 01:45:32.198]  I get a lot of sun, so I don't need D3.
[01:45:32.218 --> 01:45:32.338]  Yeah.
[01:45:34.969 --> 01:45:37.610]  Okay, um, two things I wanted to suggest.
[01:45:37.751 --> 01:45:39.752]  An Un-Vaxxed Lives Matters t-shirt.
[01:45:39.772 --> 01:45:41.933]  I've been trying to get a call in to you for a month about this.
[01:45:42.313 --> 01:45:42.933]  That will sell.
[01:45:43.414 --> 01:45:47.116]  You could probably make that for three or four years running and that'll be your best-selling shirt.
[01:45:47.196 --> 01:45:48.156]  That's a genius shirt?
[01:45:48.196 --> 01:45:50.597]  We'll put out Un-Vaxxed Lives Matter right now.
[01:45:51.578 --> 01:45:56.701]  Okay, and then I would, I know you were having issues making the Obama Deception 2 because everything was moving so fast.
[01:45:57.261 --> 01:46:02.124]  Think about Obama Deception 2, the Joe-Bama Deception, or just the Joe-Bama Deception.
[01:46:03.317 --> 01:46:05.618]  So I wanted to get to the Great Reset.
[01:46:06.078 --> 01:46:08.740]  So you see now, they're talking about it on Fox News.
[01:46:09.040 --> 01:46:09.680]  That's you.
[01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:10.601]  You did that.
[01:46:11.141 --> 01:46:13.242]  Well, let's be clear, that's our audience.
[01:46:13.762 --> 01:46:15.363]  Seriously, it's not me patting you on the head.
[01:46:15.703 --> 01:46:18.545]  If you guys and gals don't spread the word, this is you.
[01:46:19.225 --> 01:46:22.527]  We have an audience to push this out and make people look at it.
[01:46:24.568 --> 01:46:30.631]  And you asked me about 10 years ago what I thought was next, and it was specifically about gun confiscation.
[01:46:30.891 --> 01:46:32.192]  They're not going to take your guns.
[01:46:32.779 --> 01:46:35.581]  People are going to turn them in because it's going to get so bad.
[01:46:35.641 --> 01:46:38.382]  And if you want to eat and you want to drink, you're going to give up.
[01:46:38.502 --> 01:46:38.963]  Exactly.
[01:46:38.983 --> 01:46:40.123]  It's a social credit score.
[01:46:40.143 --> 01:46:41.624]  You've got to turn the gun in for the money.
[01:46:42.585 --> 01:46:44.406]  So that's where this is going.
[01:46:44.446 --> 01:46:47.048]  That's why Klaus Schwab is so arrogant.
[01:46:47.328 --> 01:46:53.291]  He's up there basically telling you... Because they created multi quadrillions of fake money.
[01:46:53.912 --> 01:46:55.553]  Real assets are a fraction of that.
[01:46:55.613 --> 01:46:57.354]  They can dictate our surrender, they think.
[01:46:58.342 --> 01:47:01.463]  So, we do need a great reset, but we need to reset them.
[01:47:01.823 --> 01:47:04.383]  You cannot compete with... It's a fact.
[01:47:05.044 --> 01:47:08.884]  I heard this... You can't compete with globalist firms that have given themselves trillions.
[01:47:09.585 --> 01:47:09.945]  Correct.
[01:47:10.265 --> 01:47:16.966]  So, my thing with Trump... Trump, stay off the left-right thing.
[01:47:17.386 --> 01:47:19.587]  If you play the cards right, if you play
[01:47:20.239 --> 01:47:25.003]  That I'm fighting the system that is screwing you every day, and they're coming after me too.
[01:47:25.524 --> 01:47:27.085]  Everybody is going to join your side.
[01:47:27.105 --> 01:47:29.307]  But you need to point out the Great Reset.
[01:47:29.327 --> 01:47:30.648]  You need to point out... I agree.
[01:47:30.668 --> 01:47:31.269]  I agree.
[01:47:31.789 --> 01:47:36.613]  If Trump comes out with a Great Reset and announces America is under globalist takeover, it's over.
[01:47:36.653 --> 01:47:37.354]  He totally wins.
[01:47:37.574 --> 01:47:39.636]  And that's why they want to get rid of him before he figures it out.
[01:47:41.037 --> 01:47:46.762]  And that's why it's so dangerous that we've got Fox News hosts starting to talk about this, because that's all Trump listens to.
[01:47:49.465 --> 01:47:54.070]  The thing is, is that if he doesn't understand it, people around him do.
[01:47:55.091 --> 01:47:56.012]  General Flynn does.
[01:47:56.253 --> 01:47:57.394]  Roger Stone does.
[01:47:57.754 --> 01:47:58.635]  People around him.
[01:47:58.676 --> 01:47:59.837]  Tucker Carlson does.
[01:48:00.376 --> 01:48:04.517]  So, get them, get yourself to get the points to him.
[01:48:04.837 --> 01:48:08.237]  Well, I can tell you, Tucker gave him all the points and Trump didn't listen.
[01:48:08.837 --> 01:48:10.798]  And that's why Tucker's pissed off at Trump.
[01:48:10.838 --> 01:48:11.578]  I'll just leave it at that.
[01:48:12.358 --> 01:48:13.338]  But yeah, no, I hear you.
[01:48:13.518 --> 01:48:13.978]  Absolutely.
[01:48:14.018 --> 01:48:15.239]  And Trump's an incredible asset.
[01:48:15.619 --> 01:48:21.420]  It's why they want him out of the picture so he doesn't lead a takeover of the Republican Party, which we're one inch away from.
[01:48:21.460 --> 01:48:22.900]  We are so close to victory.
[01:48:22.920 --> 01:48:27.621]  It's why the deep state is so dangerous and is going to launch terror attacks claiming conservatives are white supremacists.
[01:48:28.061 --> 01:48:29.441]  White supremacists, I love everybody.
[01:48:29.761 --> 01:48:30.642]  That is a load of crap.
[01:48:30.822 --> 01:48:31.763]  They are the depopulationists.
[01:48:31.783 --> 01:48:32.984]  I've never had a white supremacist in my life.
[01:48:33.704 --> 01:48:34.105]  Absolutely.
[01:48:34.145 --> 01:48:34.925]  We know that, Al Keller.
[01:48:34.945 --> 01:48:35.225]  Thank you.
[01:48:35.806 --> 01:48:37.007]  But we've got to get back in their face.
[01:48:37.027 --> 01:48:40.229]  We've got to get back in their face with this.
[01:48:40.289 --> 01:48:41.570]  And it's not the black people doing it.
[01:48:41.610 --> 01:48:46.654]  It's the white liberal academics that want to rule the world that are using this for control.
[01:48:47.335 --> 01:48:47.715]  All right.
[01:48:48.816 --> 01:48:50.397]  Kevin in New York, thanks for holding.
[01:48:50.417 --> 01:48:50.998]  You're on the air.
[01:48:52.539 --> 01:48:53.060]  Hey, Alex.
[01:48:53.080 --> 01:48:53.620]  How we doing?
[01:48:53.800 --> 01:48:54.341]  Good, brother.
[01:48:55.221 --> 01:48:55.722]  Good, good.
[01:48:55.742 --> 01:48:57.043]  So I have kind of an idea that
[01:48:58.447 --> 01:49:08.152]  Pre-emptively, hear your audience, hear the world for what's about to strike this country because we need to really sit down and take a look back.
[01:49:08.912 --> 01:49:09.413]  Back to 9-11.
[01:49:09.513 --> 01:49:13.034]  We can go back to 1967, the USS Liberty.
[01:49:13.935 --> 01:49:15.556]  There's going to be something big coming.
[01:49:15.576 --> 01:49:26.301]  And I mean, it's not going to be a mass shooting because they really need to demonize the white Christian, not even white, just the Christian ethos, the people who have a heritage in this country.
[01:49:26.781 --> 01:49:28.202]  That's the class they need to go after.
[01:49:28.772 --> 01:49:36.775]  And the majority of those people are white, but there's a lot of other ethnicities that follow this Americana ethos, this Christian ethos.
[01:49:37.675 --> 01:49:42.317]  In order to do that, and to strike at the heart of that, they need a big event.
[01:49:42.617 --> 01:49:43.958]  Something on the scale of 9-11.
[01:49:44.358 --> 01:49:49.280]  Yes, so is it a giant cyber attack, a new war, a new virus, a race war?
[01:49:50.820 --> 01:49:55.002]  Well, to trigger any of that, I think it's going to be an attack on
[01:49:55.543 --> 01:49:57.904]  Some federal buildings, either in D.C.
[01:49:58.004 --> 01:49:59.025]  or in some capital.
[01:49:59.405 --> 01:50:02.846]  That's why I would tell people stay away from those places in the next coming years.
[01:50:03.366 --> 01:50:15.872]  But I think what your show needs to do, and you need to do cross-collaboration with a lot of third parties that have studied 9-11, studied USS Liberty, studied these big attacks, and have like a big forum.
[01:50:16.716 --> 01:50:17.537]  I agree.
[01:50:17.597 --> 01:50:26.162]  I said three weeks ago with Nick Fuentes and others, we need a forum on January 6th and now you see that public forum happening.
[01:50:26.462 --> 01:50:31.585]  We need to have a giant debate about what's their next false flag because we can always study the last event, the last war.
[01:50:31.806 --> 01:50:33.106]  They're going to play that card.
[01:50:33.166 --> 01:50:33.787]  That's their card.
[01:50:35.541 --> 01:50:35.802]  Right.
[01:50:36.102 --> 01:50:47.878]  Yeah, I think if you really dig into 9-11 and show sort of the methods that they use and stuff and that, you can really bring up the 9-11 Truth or Movement again, get that going because that really is the Achilles heel.
[01:50:48.358 --> 01:50:51.222]  I think the more Americans that are awake to the truth of 9-11,
[01:50:52.323 --> 01:51:01.309]  Uh, the more we're going to win to our side, people are going to begin to understand how these people work and the cards that they play, because it's the same formula they use over and over again.
[01:51:01.329 --> 01:51:05.672]  Well, that's what frustrates me is it's so damn formulaic, but people go, why is it formulaic?
[01:51:05.692 --> 01:51:06.612]  Because it works!
[01:51:07.533 --> 01:51:07.753]  Right.
[01:51:08.354 --> 01:51:11.356]  Because human psychology and human nature is never changed.
[01:51:11.636 --> 01:51:13.497]  It's the same throughout millennia.
[01:51:14.148 --> 01:51:24.556]  And I know you don't hate this too much, but I wish you would talk more about the history of the Bolshevik era, the USSR takeover with the Leninists, Stalinists.
[01:51:25.236 --> 01:51:34.463]  I know you're talking about the Maoist revolution, but really, the formula... Well, sir, I mean, this is all the same play that was done to Russia and then magnified by China.
[01:51:35.043 --> 01:51:38.266]  Because the globalists lost control of Russia, and now China's their big baby.
[01:51:39.227 --> 01:51:39.647]  But I hear you.
[01:51:39.688 --> 01:51:44.772]  It's the exact same playbook, and it is very cold-blooded folks that think it's their right to rule over us.
[01:51:45.433 --> 01:51:46.654]  And we've just got to say no to it.
[01:51:46.674 --> 01:51:47.275]  Thank you so much.
[01:51:47.735 --> 01:51:48.076]  All right!
[01:51:49.209 --> 01:51:50.270]  I know we got loaded phones.
[01:51:50.370 --> 01:51:51.611]  We got Max Keiser coming up.
[01:51:52.051 --> 01:51:53.472]  Then I'm going to jam those calls in.
[01:51:53.593 --> 01:51:56.035]  And then, we got a special guest host coming up.
[01:51:56.515 --> 01:51:58.296]  Stay with us, InfoWars.com.
[01:51:58.717 --> 01:52:03.721]  Don't forget Band.Video, but you can't share Band.Video because we have the other URL, FreeWorldNews.TV.
[01:52:04.481 --> 01:52:13.389]  In my film, published in 2002, The Road to Tyranny, and then in my book, 9-11 Dissent and the Tyranny,
[01:52:15.606 --> 01:52:39.346]  I point directly at a Pentagon plan from 1977, declassified in 2000, but then reclassified later, to have humans born to artificial wombs and put in tanks so there'd be no more crime, and from birth we'd be in an artificial reality with wires plugged to our brains, and then the ruling class could make sure we had true peace.
[01:52:41.467 --> 01:52:43.169]  You know, that guy turned into the film The Matrix.
[01:52:45.233 --> 01:52:46.274]  But here's what I'm getting at.
[01:52:48.014 --> 01:52:52.217]  This startup harvests body heat to mine cryptocurrencies.
[01:52:53.037 --> 01:52:53.737]  The new stack.
[01:52:56.519 --> 01:53:07.205]  And they go on to say their recent speculative craze for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has led to a growing number of people jumping on the viral bandwagon to mine and decentralize peer-to-peer digital currency.
[01:53:07.845 --> 01:53:08.745]  Well, it sounds like something
[01:53:11.555 --> 01:53:26.987]  The process of mining bitcoins has serious real-world impacts and it goes in to say the startup group wants you to lay in a bed that then takes your energy and your heat and then transfers it into Bitcoin.
[01:53:27.007 --> 01:53:31.791]  But the point is that's the whole matrix plan from the beginning.
[01:53:34.153 --> 01:53:37.216]  And so now Bitcoin is definitely revolutionizing a lot of things.
[01:53:37.796 --> 01:53:39.478]  The globalists don't like it on some fronts.
[01:53:41.405 --> 01:53:45.566]  You can also look at that matrix level thing and just say, this is where the future is going.
[01:53:45.907 --> 01:53:50.048]  I wanted to bring that up first because Max Keiser had the Hollywood Stock Exchange.
[01:53:50.068 --> 01:53:51.528]  He predicted something like Bitcoin.
[01:53:51.548 --> 01:53:54.489]  He was an early adopter of it more than 10 years ago.
[01:53:54.529 --> 01:53:56.110]  He's been proven right about to a great extent.
[01:53:57.182 --> 01:54:00.846]  Now he's talking about Latin American countries mining it with volcanic energy.
[01:54:00.866 --> 01:54:02.488]  I mean, this is cutting-edge stuff.
[01:54:03.008 --> 01:54:09.795]  But he also coined the term the casino gulag, and really talked about how we'll turn the human into the commodity.
[01:54:10.516 --> 01:54:11.457]  And here we are.
[01:54:11.477 --> 01:54:12.939]  So that's just an interesting little angle.
[01:54:13.319 --> 01:54:15.461]  I know you also have your big tour coming up.
[01:54:15.521 --> 01:54:16.422]  We can't say on air.
[01:54:16.442 --> 01:54:19.265]  It's run over 200 radio stations, but it's the F. Elon tour.
[01:54:20.006 --> 01:54:22.828]  I guess folks are mad at Elon Musk trying to take control of Bitcoin.
[01:54:23.769 --> 01:54:26.812]  And so we'll also talk about that here with Max Keiser today.
[01:54:26.892 --> 01:54:27.772]  Max, good to have you with us.
[01:54:29.294 --> 01:54:32.056]  Hey, Alex, great to be back with you.
[01:54:32.356 --> 01:54:36.379]  Yeah, the Bitcoin phenomenon is becoming global.
[01:54:36.699 --> 01:54:38.901]  And so now all the narratives are coming out.
[01:54:39.241 --> 01:54:43.225]  It's a big threat to central banks, the IMF, the World Bank, regular banks.
[01:54:43.585 --> 01:54:45.326]  So you're going to hear a lot of different narratives.
[01:54:45.667 --> 01:54:47.928]  That particular one about hooking up to
[01:54:49.344 --> 01:54:53.806]  Some kind of human enabled Bitcoin mining machine, etc.
[01:54:54.246 --> 01:54:56.507]  That's a narrative and it's an interesting narrative.
[01:54:56.527 --> 01:55:06.932]  I think more importantly, what we're seeing in El Salvador right now is something that takes precedent when you're talking about Bitcoin and what's happening around the world.
[01:55:07.212 --> 01:55:18.898]  So here's a country that was being subjected to IMF kind of predatory lending and had a really tough time establishing their own sovereignty outside of the IMF.
[01:55:19.298 --> 01:55:23.061]  And what they said was, you know what, we're just going to step completely out of the U.S.
[01:55:23.121 --> 01:55:23.961]  dollar matrix.
[01:55:24.021 --> 01:55:28.144]  And that's where the matrix really resonates, is the U.S.
[01:55:28.224 --> 01:55:29.465]  dollar global matrix.
[01:55:29.705 --> 01:55:33.548]  They said, we're going to make Bitcoin the legal tender here in El Salvador.
[01:55:34.288 --> 01:55:38.171]  And already they're just enjoying tremendous benefits from it.
[01:55:38.411 --> 01:55:42.254]  Both the World Bank and the IMF have both said, hey, you know, you're not allowed to do that.
[01:55:42.474 --> 01:55:48.358]  As a matter of fact, the World Bank, which in their charter with El Salvador, said that there's nothing against
[01:55:48.818 --> 01:55:57.940]  And Max, I want to get into that, but the real reason you're on today, because you wanted to cover it and I really respect your view on it, because you've been a former top stock broker, really made a lot of economic predictions that have come true.
[01:55:57.960 --> 01:55:58.880]  A lot of numbers came out.
[01:55:58.960 --> 01:56:00.380]  I've got 20 articles or so here, but
[01:56:16.543 --> 01:56:19.931]  Showing that inflation is much worse than the Federal Reserve had previously said.
[01:56:20.311 --> 01:56:22.756]  Now the Federal Reserve is having to admit it's going to get really bad.
[01:56:23.418 --> 01:56:26.103]  Claiming maybe interest rates increases are coming.
[01:56:26.404 --> 01:56:27.566]  What's the latest on inflation?
[01:56:29.423 --> 01:56:29.643]  Right.
[01:56:30.124 --> 01:56:37.009]  As we've been saying, that all the money printing is inevitably going to lead to real inflation.
[01:56:37.049 --> 01:56:41.732]  And the reason it's been masked for so many years is because labor has been outsourced to China.
[01:56:42.133 --> 01:56:48.838]  And so you don't really see inflation as such hitting in the supermarket or at the petrol station.
[01:56:49.078 --> 01:56:52.441]  But now that you've got wage parity between China and the U.S.,
[01:56:53.121 --> 01:56:57.142]  The actual inflation numbers are starting to be ratcheted up.
[01:56:57.282 --> 01:57:03.905]  So even the Federal Reserve Bank is saying, well, we're actually three, three and a half percent, which is well above the two percent we were talking about.
[01:57:04.325 --> 01:57:11.227]  The fact is, if you use to calculate inflation the way you should use it, which includes things like housing, health care,
[01:57:11.906 --> 01:57:13.269]  Education and things like that.
[01:57:13.289 --> 01:57:15.713]  The actual inflation rate in America right now is about 12%.
[01:57:15.793 --> 01:57:23.727]  The last time we had inflation this high, Paul Volcker, who was the central bank Fed chairman at that time, raised rates all the way up to 20%.
[01:57:25.006 --> 01:57:29.027]  But the central bank now is saying, oh, no, no, no, we can't raise rates.
[01:57:29.108 --> 01:57:30.068]  They just had a meeting.
[01:57:30.108 --> 01:57:31.248]  They did not raise rates.
[01:57:31.849 --> 01:57:36.210]  And they're saying that the inflation is transitory and it's not a problem.
[01:57:36.430 --> 01:57:49.615]  The reason they say that is because they're in the pocket of Wall Street and Wall Street wants cheap rates to do their mergers and acquisitions and their other corporate activities at the cheapest possible price, which means the cheapest possible interest rates possible.
[01:57:49.995 --> 01:57:55.499]  So the Fed is working at completely odds with the interest of the average American.
[01:57:55.539 --> 01:58:14.012]  The average American doesn't want... But isn't that because, as you just said, it's the most predatory Federal Reserve in its hundred plus years ever, where this is totally against the average person, totally against the working class, completely against the middle class, all this free money to mega banks to then buy up every major supplement company we've used.
[01:58:14.432 --> 01:58:16.594]  Except one has been bought out the last year.
[01:58:16.895 --> 01:58:18.576]  Just an example of the businesses I'm in.
[01:58:18.957 --> 01:58:20.918]  Almost all the textile companies have been bought out.
[01:58:21.359 --> 01:58:30.568]  Almost all the companies, this is, because they've got all this free money, as you said, they don't care if it inflates us and hurts our savings, because in the process they're buying up the world is what you're saying.
[01:58:31.701 --> 01:58:32.661]  That's exactly correct.
[01:58:33.062 --> 01:58:39.945]  The fact that your companies, your vendors, the people you do business with, they're all being bought up by private equity and other groups, is a great example.
[01:58:40.145 --> 01:58:41.926]  They are able to borrow money for zero.
[01:58:42.466 --> 01:58:46.869]  And they can buy up income-producing assets, and that money goes directly to the bottom line.
[01:58:46.889 --> 01:58:47.909]  It didn't cost them anything.
[01:58:48.129 --> 01:58:52.351]  For you and I, we're living, or a lot of people in America, they're living on credit cards and other debts.
[01:58:52.371 --> 01:58:53.932]  They're paying 17, 18 percent.
[01:58:53.972 --> 01:58:57.734]  Or they go to a payday lender and they pay 2,000 percent annual rates of interest.
[01:58:58.014 --> 01:58:59.675]  So it's what I call interest rate apartheid.
[01:59:00.035 --> 01:59:02.277]  It's 0% for Friends of Goldman Sachs.
[01:59:02.357 --> 01:59:04.319]  Everyone else pays 18% and above.
[01:59:04.679 --> 01:59:09.003]  And if you start the month 18% of the whole, you've got to make 18% just to break even.
[01:59:09.023 --> 01:59:10.224]  A lot of people can't make it.
[01:59:10.404 --> 01:59:11.665]  And then Max, here's the key.
[01:59:11.685 --> 01:59:17.150]  I want your take on the very same mega fat cats and the big tech companies owning slave camps in China.
[01:59:17.530 --> 01:59:26.918]  They then fund Black Lives Matter and make it all about a fight between left and right or black and white while they're involved in the greatest criminal transfer of wealth the world's ever seen.
[01:59:26.958 --> 01:59:28.179]  It's a perfect smoke screen.
[01:59:28.499 --> 01:59:29.860]  I mean, actually, bravo to them.
[01:59:29.900 --> 01:59:31.901]  They really are screwing people over.
[01:59:31.941 --> 01:59:32.662]  How do we counter them?
[01:59:34.263 --> 01:59:39.987]  Well, what you're describing there is we saw this in China during the cultural revolution under Mao, right?
[01:59:40.027 --> 01:59:49.533]  So they want to make everybody wear little green jackets and carry a little book from the Federal Reserve Bank talking about how great the interest rate policy is.
[01:59:49.933 --> 01:59:51.954]  So it's the cultural revolution of America.
[01:59:52.295 --> 01:59:57.318]  This is what happens when you let the left take control and you destroy the free market.
[01:59:57.638 --> 02:00:00.000]  And that's what that's all about, and that's what's happening right now.
[02:00:00.300 --> 02:00:06.244]  So I don't think there's anything good going to come out of it by kowtowing to the mob.
[02:00:06.264 --> 02:00:08.645]  And then they're going to blame the free market, which this isn't.
[02:00:08.665 --> 02:00:10.166]  This is a crony capitalist market.
[02:00:10.527 --> 02:00:17.752]  And then the very group that steals the world through this fraud is going to use that as the pretext to then set up their true economic dictatorship.
[02:00:19.253 --> 02:00:21.454]  They already have an economic dictatorship.
[02:00:21.494 --> 02:00:22.895]  This is just the icing on the cake.
[02:00:23.718 --> 02:00:29.022]  And again, just to return to Bitcoin, I mean, Bitcoin is the escape hatch, as Christine Lagarde called it.
[02:00:29.062 --> 02:00:33.145]  It's the only way out of this, and countries like El Salvador are proving that.
[02:00:33.545 --> 02:00:37.007]  But we are already in the monetary dictatorship.
[02:00:37.047 --> 02:00:39.909]  We already suffer financial terrorism and arsonists.
[02:00:40.130 --> 02:00:47.255]  That's why so many people in America are suffering, is because they are being victimized by financial arsonists.
[02:00:47.275 --> 02:00:48.756]  Wait, the megabanks aren't the problem?
[02:00:48.796 --> 02:00:50.457]  I thought white supremacists were the problem.
[02:00:52.162 --> 02:01:07.645]  No, that's a narrative that's put out there to try to eliminate this whole vestige of a free market capitalist society where it's a meritocracy, where there's initiative and there's entrepreneurialism.
[02:01:07.685 --> 02:01:09.045]  That's got to be gotten rid of.
[02:01:09.445 --> 02:01:19.547]  Instead, there's a Federal Reserve Bank that issues free money and the fact that prices are skyrocketing and your quality of life is crashing, you should be feeling good about that.
[02:01:19.667 --> 02:01:20.668]  This is anti-white supremacy.
[02:01:20.688 --> 02:01:21.229]  Yeah, I'll stay there.
[02:01:21.449 --> 02:01:22.750]  We are on the march.
[02:01:25.513 --> 02:01:27.135]  The empire is on the run.
[02:01:29.565 --> 02:01:31.206]  But now the empire has struck back.
[02:01:31.266 --> 02:01:33.227]  Final segment with Max Keiser.
[02:01:33.247 --> 02:01:34.527]  We might go five minutes to the next hour.
[02:01:35.187 --> 02:01:36.948]  But then we have Stu Peters taking over.
[02:01:37.128 --> 02:01:38.589]  Then the War of Moments show here at 3 p.m.
[02:01:38.609 --> 02:01:39.209]  Central today.
[02:01:39.229 --> 02:01:40.930]  Your word of mouth is victory.
[02:01:41.170 --> 02:01:45.192]  It is key to the whole fight, so thank you for spreading the word about our live feeds, our articles, and our videos.
[02:01:45.232 --> 02:01:48.313]  Everybody's blown away by the amount of traffic demand on video.
[02:01:48.673 --> 02:01:55.036]  That's you just sharing those videos on your email list, your text message, you name it, and buying products at infowarestore.com.
[02:01:56.377 --> 02:01:57.097]  Now, real quick.
[02:01:58.149 --> 02:02:00.070]  Infowarsphone.com.
[02:02:00.730 --> 02:02:05.872]  Infowarsphone.com is one of the biggest distributors in the world of satellite phones.
[02:02:06.152 --> 02:02:13.915]  You get a free $600 plus phone when you sign up for a year for your monthly minutes that are $99.95.
[02:02:13.995 --> 02:02:20.117]  But all calls to you are free from sat phones, landlines, cell phones, you name it, and it doesn't track you.
[02:02:21.217 --> 02:02:22.478]  This is a system you want
[02:02:23.692 --> 02:02:24.292]  It's amazing.
[02:02:24.713 --> 02:02:28.435]  You can also get antennas so it works in your car, in your house, but it works anywhere outside.
[02:02:28.475 --> 02:02:29.936]  You can see the sky day or night.
[02:02:31.417 --> 02:02:32.858]  Infowarsphone.com.
[02:02:32.958 --> 02:02:34.259]  Infowarsphone.com.
[02:02:34.279 --> 02:02:36.300]  With all the things going on, you need this.
[02:02:36.761 --> 02:02:38.882]  And I wouldn't just have it as an emergency backup.
[02:02:38.962 --> 02:02:39.743]  I'd start using it.
[02:02:39.803 --> 02:02:40.543]  I've started using them.
[02:02:40.823 --> 02:02:43.125]  It just lets you think about how much your regular cell phone's being tracked.
[02:02:43.145 --> 02:02:43.805]  941-955-1020.
[02:02:43.825 --> 02:02:43.865]  941-955-1020.
[02:02:43.885 --> 02:02:45.426]  Ask for the Alex Jones Special.
[02:02:45.446 --> 02:02:46.687]  That's Infowarsphone.
[02:02:53.427 --> 02:02:54.688]  We're good to go.
[02:03:15.416 --> 02:03:21.201]  To kick something off with your significant other, Stacey, in Texas very soon.
[02:03:21.221 --> 02:03:23.042]  And it's not very friendly towards Elon Musk.
[02:03:23.362 --> 02:03:23.963]  Tell us about it.
[02:03:25.304 --> 02:03:27.986]  Right, so we're having a big party at Spider House.
[02:03:28.596 --> 02:03:29.737]  In Austin, Texas.
[02:03:30.137 --> 02:03:31.617]  And it's really a Bitcoin party.
[02:03:32.278 --> 02:03:39.400]  And we're kicking around Elon Musk and Mark Cuban and a lot of people who say stupid things about Bitcoin and a lot of fun.
[02:03:40.181 --> 02:03:41.641]  We're going to have a great barbecue there.
[02:03:41.921 --> 02:03:44.643]  I'd like to give two tickets away right now to your listeners.
[02:03:45.263 --> 02:03:48.304]  You can arrange that on your end and figure out who those two listeners are going to be.
[02:03:48.684 --> 02:03:50.165]  But I'm putting two tickets.
[02:03:50.185 --> 02:03:52.346]  They're going for 150 bucks a ticket right now.
[02:03:52.386 --> 02:03:54.146]  You can still have a few tickets left.
[02:03:55.027 --> 02:03:57.868]  If you go to Eventbrite and search this
[02:03:58.732 --> 02:04:04.336]  Elon Musk, Mark Cuban, or Max Keiser, or go to my Twitter handle at Max Keiser, you'll find links.
[02:04:04.936 --> 02:04:08.719]  And we've got a few tickets left, and we're going to have a couple hundred, 250 people there.
[02:04:09.219 --> 02:04:11.861]  Bitcoin Magazine's coming on as a media sponsor.
[02:04:11.881 --> 02:04:19.686]  They're going to be live streaming the event, and it's kind of like a... I've got to tell you, it's great you want to give tickets away, but it's almost sold out.
[02:04:20.126 --> 02:04:21.867]  You could have 5,000 people at this event.
[02:04:21.887 --> 02:04:24.109]  I mean, you were just at one in Miami that was totally jam-packed.
[02:04:24.129 --> 02:04:27.171]  So your problem is you need to do more events, Max.
[02:04:28.732 --> 02:04:29.793]  Well, we're going to go on tour.
[02:04:29.873 --> 02:04:32.254]  So the idea here is to make it a little intimate.
[02:04:32.534 --> 02:04:35.355]  We're going to have a lot of the Bitcoin legends that live in Austin.
[02:04:35.456 --> 02:04:37.357]  Austin is a Bitcoin hotspot in the world.
[02:04:37.377 --> 02:04:42.099]  We're going to have a lot of those folks in the venue so people can rub elbows.
[02:04:42.279 --> 02:04:44.260]  And it's like the Sundance Film Festival.
[02:04:44.280 --> 02:04:48.182]  If you've ever been there, you know, kind of the major stars are walking around Main Street.
[02:04:48.562 --> 02:04:53.065]  Here we're going to have big, you know, legends in the Austin Bitcoin community are going to be right there.
[02:04:53.405 --> 02:04:55.906]  So people who come, they'll be rubbing elbows with these folks.
[02:04:55.926 --> 02:04:56.547]  Sounds good.
[02:04:57.227 --> 02:04:58.087]  Huge success.
[02:04:58.487 --> 02:05:00.528]  People can find the dates on your Twitter.
[02:05:01.108 --> 02:05:03.228]  All right, Max Keiser, what's the date you're coming to Austin again?
[02:05:04.369 --> 02:05:05.909]  The show's on July 8th.
[02:05:06.049 --> 02:05:07.950]  I'll be there two days before, two days after.
[02:05:08.010 --> 02:05:10.650]  If anybody needs me or anything, I'm available.
[02:05:10.870 --> 02:05:11.230]  That's good.
[02:05:11.250 --> 02:05:12.271]  So you're going to be in the studio with us.
[02:05:13.311 --> 02:05:15.572]  Yes, I will be in the studio with you.
[02:05:15.612 --> 02:05:18.552]  We have to continue our Nerf gun war.
[02:05:18.972 --> 02:05:21.213]  I won the first battle, Alex Jones.
[02:05:22.199 --> 02:05:22.881]  I forgot about that.
[02:05:22.921 --> 02:05:25.587]  Pull up Max Keiser, Alex Jones, Nerf Guns.
[02:05:25.607 --> 02:05:26.429]  I think I won.
[02:05:27.050 --> 02:05:28.173]  But we'll see what happens.
[02:05:28.494 --> 02:05:30.077]  Hey Max, getting serious the time we have left.
[02:05:31.371 --> 02:05:40.720]  I'm really concerned about the Attorney General, the FBI director saying the greatest threat is conservatives, people that question elections, they want to get rid of due process, use the Patriot Act on members of Congress.
[02:05:41.101 --> 02:05:42.282]  I'm sure you've seen these clips.
[02:05:42.362 --> 02:05:46.386]  I mean, this is like an authoritarian nightmare right out of a movie.
[02:05:46.426 --> 02:05:47.968]  The old left would have opposed this.
[02:05:48.448 --> 02:05:52.572]  They are really spoiling to come after people, not just the January 6th folks.
[02:05:52.632 --> 02:05:53.553]  What do you think that's about?
[02:05:53.873 --> 02:05:55.135]  I'm really concerned about a false flag.
[02:05:57.117 --> 02:06:08.924]  Well, yeah, it is kind of a continuation of what we were just saying before the break, that you've got a cadre of money printers that understand that the way to enslave people is to flood them with fiat money.
[02:06:09.364 --> 02:06:11.785]  The way people get unhealthy is they eat fiat food.
[02:06:12.285 --> 02:06:15.287]  And, you know, your show has supplements and you try to fight the fiat food.
[02:06:15.707 --> 02:06:18.509]  The way the economy gets sick is it's flooded with fiat money.
[02:06:19.009 --> 02:06:19.650]  And the U.S.
[02:06:19.690 --> 02:06:22.451]  dollar is losing purchasing power every single day.
[02:06:22.791 --> 02:06:26.413]  And people start blaming themselves, like, why is my money losing purchasing power?
[02:06:26.693 --> 02:06:28.034]  They don't really want to take on board.
[02:06:28.094 --> 02:06:36.159]  It's because of a concerted effort by their own government to destroy the underlying economy so that they can make a few of their friends absolutely rich.
[02:06:36.799 --> 02:06:41.000]  And the same thing is happening now with a democratically controlled Washington, D.C.
[02:06:41.140 --> 02:06:42.881]  They are in the pocket of Wall Street.
[02:06:43.141 --> 02:06:49.122]  The Clintons and all those folks and, you know, Joe Biden came out of the credit card lobbying industry.
[02:06:49.182 --> 02:06:51.943]  He's been the credit card lobbyist in Washington for decades.
[02:06:52.563 --> 02:06:54.164]  That's their constituency.
[02:06:54.204 --> 02:06:55.124]  That's who they work for.
[02:06:55.384 --> 02:07:02.146]  And they want to continue money printing and putting people into as much debt as they possibly can because you're becoming a debt slave.
[02:07:02.726 --> 02:07:03.587]  That's their agenda.
[02:07:03.867 --> 02:07:07.909]  And then once you become a debt slave, you're going to be prone to anxiety attacks.
[02:07:07.929 --> 02:07:09.470]  So now you're going to take a lot of pharmaceuticals.
[02:07:09.490 --> 02:07:10.211]  So let me ask you this.
[02:07:10.691 --> 02:07:12.652]  What do you think the time frame is on this?
[02:07:12.692 --> 02:07:14.813]  I mean, this is going to get very destructive worldwide.
[02:07:15.213 --> 02:07:18.295]  What countries do you think have better currencies right now?
[02:07:18.315 --> 02:07:19.296]  I know you're all about Bitcoin.
[02:07:19.336 --> 02:07:19.736]  I get that.
[02:07:19.756 --> 02:07:24.299]  But I'm saying the old dinosaur currencies, which one's going to be the first to bite the dust?
[02:07:26.892 --> 02:07:28.873]  They're all hyperinflating right now.
[02:07:29.814 --> 02:07:30.655]  You know, all the time.
[02:07:30.695 --> 02:07:35.418]  You see in some of these countries, the currency is absolutely collapsing.
[02:07:35.698 --> 02:07:46.606]  Aside from El Salvador now going on to a Bitcoin standard, we have Paraguay and Guatemala are now making moves to make Bitcoin legal tender in those countries.
[02:07:46.846 --> 02:07:48.748]  What's happening in Latin America, Central America,
[02:07:49.228 --> 02:07:52.591]  Alex is the revolution we've been talking about for 10 years.
[02:07:53.331 --> 02:08:03.859]  They and and that's the most exciting thing in the world today in terms of pushing back against the globalists, the central bankers, the IMF, the World Bank, Jamie Dimon and the Wall Street banks.
[02:08:03.939 --> 02:08:04.860]  It's happening right there.
[02:08:05.902 --> 02:08:18.678]  All credit goes to my friend Jack Mollers, who was there for months putting in the InStrike system, which gives you instant payments on your phone and great access to Bitcoin.
[02:08:19.138 --> 02:08:20.700]  It's the trendiest app.
[02:08:22.142 --> 02:08:35.212]  I'm no fan of Xi Jinping, obviously, but David came out last week during G7 and said, you globalists don't run anything anymore, we're not cutting carbon, we're going to have three kids instead of one, and screw you, you don't run the New World Order anymore, nobody does.
[02:08:35.572 --> 02:08:36.753]  They said nobody runs it.
[02:08:36.993 --> 02:08:40.476]  And there's got to be a moment where everybody realizes the whole Kissinger era is over.
[02:08:40.957 --> 02:08:46.401]  What comes out of that is everybody just stops following what the New World Order says or the FBI pointing a gun at your head.
[02:08:47.816 --> 02:08:55.627]  Right, and not to belabor this point, but the thing about Bitcoin, Alex, is that there is no central authority running the protocol.
[02:08:55.707 --> 02:08:56.769]  It's totally decentralized.
[02:08:56.849 --> 02:09:01.415]  No, I know you told us a year ago, six months ago, two months ago, countries will start adopting it and others will.
[02:09:01.435 --> 02:09:04.259]  It'll cause a stampede and the hash wars will start.
[02:09:04.299 --> 02:09:04.680]  I got that.
[02:09:05.140 --> 02:09:13.311]  I'm asking you about... Okay, so China is a centralized, top-down, authoritarian country that's going to lose against Bitcoin.
[02:09:13.491 --> 02:09:17.075]  It's only a question of time when they give up the ghost and succumb to Bitcoin.
[02:09:17.095 --> 02:09:21.601]  But I agree, but in between them, they're telling the globalists, put them in power, you screw off.
[02:09:21.621 --> 02:09:22.783]  So that's going to be a big deal.
[02:09:24.531 --> 02:09:33.563]  There's a lot of belligerence happening between China and everybody else, and especially over Hong Kong and especially over Taiwan.
[02:09:33.843 --> 02:09:39.831]  So it looks like we're on, as many have said, you go from currency war to trade war to a hot war.
[02:09:40.431 --> 02:09:42.454]  And now we're entering the hot war era.
[02:09:42.895 --> 02:09:44.377]  So there is an existential crisis.
[02:09:44.417 --> 02:09:46.099]  We are on the footstep, doorstep.
[02:09:46.119 --> 02:09:46.540]  Exactly.
[02:09:46.560 --> 02:09:52.007]  So why is it the left trying to organize America into a cohesive force if we're about to go into a hot war with China?
[02:09:52.047 --> 02:09:57.715]  Instead, they're still trying to fight the old war to dominate people culturally when that makes China have no respect for us.
[02:09:58.851 --> 02:10:15.115]  Because the information in America, and I don't, you know, people who watch InfoWars should understand that the information and news in America is completely dictated to by a corporate agenda and has absolutely nothing to do with any underlying facts or truth.
[02:10:15.175 --> 02:10:19.156]  And the corporate agenda is hiding behind black people and poor people while it loots the world.
[02:10:19.196 --> 02:10:21.757]  No, no, the corporate agenda is to send bombs.
[02:10:21.997 --> 02:10:28.866]  Because war is incredibly profitable, and those few that make out with war are loving war.
[02:10:28.966 --> 02:10:35.335]  And it's like you said, suicide bankers like you knew people in the World Trade Center who stayed trading to make extra money until they died.
[02:10:36.977 --> 02:10:37.377]  That's right.
[02:10:37.838 --> 02:10:38.238]  That's right.
[02:10:38.258 --> 02:10:43.161]  They were trading airline option puts all the way until the building around them collapsed.
[02:10:43.541 --> 02:10:46.142]  And that's a suicide banker.
[02:10:46.763 --> 02:10:55.888]  But it's the same mentality of Jamie Dimon today, who is out there doing the same thing, but on a subtler basis with his derivatives and all of his lobbying for rights.
[02:10:55.908 --> 02:11:01.091]  So he'll fund the nuclear missiles that blow the planet up, but when the planet blows up, he'll be the richest man.
[02:11:03.428 --> 02:11:06.470]  It's like a Outer Limits episode, right?
[02:11:07.030 --> 02:11:17.716]  It makes no sense from a humanitarian point of view, but if you're a psychotic, serial terrorist, financial terrorist like Wall Street Banker, in your mind, it makes sense.
[02:11:17.736 --> 02:11:19.317]  But these people are psychotic, Alex.
[02:11:19.737 --> 02:11:20.378]  That's the problem.
[02:11:20.418 --> 02:11:22.379]  They are psychotic and they run big banks.
[02:11:23.697 --> 02:11:27.199]  All right, five more minutes with Max Keiser, and then we've got our guest host taking over.
[02:11:27.219 --> 02:11:29.761]  Stu Peters always does an amazing job.
[02:11:29.801 --> 02:11:32.383]  And then the War Room, Owen Troyer, 3 to 6 p.m.
[02:11:32.403 --> 02:11:37.366]  And I want to thank listeners for promoting the American Journal with Harrison Smith and the War Room.
[02:11:37.386 --> 02:11:42.870]  They're really exploding now, and that's great, because folks work hard on those shows to bring you hard-hitting information.
[02:11:42.890 --> 02:11:45.812]  So hey, you may already know all this stuff, probably know more than I do, doesn't matter.
[02:11:46.112 --> 02:11:49.454]  Share the articles and videos about the shows, because that's how we move the ball forward.
[02:11:50.095 --> 02:11:51.295]  Hour number four, straight ahead.
[02:11:52.536 --> 02:11:53.537]  El Salvador.
[02:11:56.141 --> 02:11:57.442]  He's been saying it for years.
[02:11:57.502 --> 02:12:02.824]  As soon as countries start adopting Bitcoin as legal tender, he believes it would cause a chain reaction.
[02:12:03.364 --> 02:12:05.505]  That chain reaction has now begun.
[02:12:05.525 --> 02:12:08.346]  Max Keiser, finish up your point on that, please.
[02:12:10.109 --> 02:12:10.349]  Right.
[02:12:10.389 --> 02:12:12.470]  So we talked about it as hash war.
[02:12:13.810 --> 02:12:16.631]  Basically, countries competing with each other.
[02:12:16.931 --> 02:12:21.932]  And this was the answer to when people would come up and say, hey, what if countries outlaw Bitcoin?
[02:12:22.173 --> 02:12:22.933]  Well, there's two answers.
[02:12:22.953 --> 02:12:28.434]  Number one is it's impossible to outlaw Bitcoin, just like it's impossible to outlaw P2P file sharing.
[02:12:28.474 --> 02:12:31.455]  Just ask Hollywood or the recording industry about that.
[02:12:31.515 --> 02:12:36.117]  You cannot shut down a file sharing network online.
[02:12:36.177 --> 02:12:36.957]  So it's impossible.
[02:12:37.857 --> 02:12:40.678]  Bitcoin is a P2P, essentially, currency.
[02:12:41.178 --> 02:12:46.879]  The second answer is that the more likely scenario is that countries like, here we have El Salvador, realize, you know what?
[02:12:47.359 --> 02:12:55.661]  We can have a banking system that's outside of the current banking system and outside of any nation state with hard money where purchasing power is going to increase.
[02:12:55.921 --> 02:12:57.101]  So we're going to adopt Bitcoin.
[02:12:57.121 --> 02:12:58.122]  We're going to mine Bitcoin.
[02:12:58.142 --> 02:13:01.202]  We're going to use volcano energy, geothermal energy to mine Bitcoin.
[02:13:01.502 --> 02:13:03.963]  Now, Paraguay and Guatemala,
[02:13:04.603 --> 02:13:05.103]  I think so.
[02:13:21.954 --> 02:13:22.434]  We're good.
[02:13:45.353 --> 02:13:47.437]  Now, they've really been trying to push Bitcoin down.
[02:13:47.457 --> 02:13:48.959]  I know you've been mad at Elon Musk.
[02:13:49.721 --> 02:13:52.125]  He seems to be kind of manipulating the market right now.
[02:13:52.165 --> 02:13:54.710]  If you guys can put up the last month of Bitcoin, it went down quite a bit.
[02:13:55.070 --> 02:13:55.892]  Now it's going back up.
[02:13:55.932 --> 02:13:56.413]  What's happening?
[02:13:58.735 --> 02:14:06.419]  Well, it's been in this for 10 years, and we've had 15 pullbacks in those 10 years, and this is an average pullback.
[02:14:06.499 --> 02:14:10.621]  It's about the ninth largest pullback in the last 10 years or so.
[02:14:11.922 --> 02:14:18.165]  More importantly, the underlying fundamentals in terms of corporations like MicroStrategy is adding billions to their balance sheet.
[02:14:18.265 --> 02:14:19.906]  El Salvador is obviously getting into the game.
[02:14:19.926 --> 02:14:22.387]  You've got even central banks getting involved, governments getting involved.
[02:14:22.747 --> 02:14:27.550]  Compared to where Bitcoin was even a year ago, this seems like a capitulation, as I've called it, to Bitcoin.
[02:14:29.033 --> 02:14:29.293]  It is.
[02:14:30.154 --> 02:14:32.376]  You know, you get the price of Bitcoin you deserve.
[02:14:33.076 --> 02:14:38.880]  Elon Musk, you know, he has a big voice and he has a lot of money and he's tweeting about Bitcoin.
[02:14:38.940 --> 02:14:45.985]  And what I used to do when I tweeted about Bitcoin in 2011, 2012 and 2013, the price would move 50 percent a day.
[02:14:46.446 --> 02:14:49.328]  So he's Elon Musk is doing a Max Keiser.
[02:14:49.748 --> 02:14:51.730]  You know, six, seven years later.
[02:14:51.850 --> 02:15:07.204]  Most everything anyone does in Bitcoin, whether it's the insults that they use to criticize it or the things they'd like to say that they like about it, if you go back to my shows from eight, nine, ten years ago... I'm not like Peter Schiff, who I think is a good guy, but he could have done it and missed the boat.
[02:15:07.324 --> 02:15:07.864]  I missed the boat.
[02:15:07.944 --> 02:15:08.605]  I meant I was wrong.
[02:15:09.466 --> 02:15:11.668]  So I see, I learn from my mistakes.
[02:15:13.179 --> 02:15:28.384]  Well, you know, Peter Schiff has a very hardened stance, whereas Spencer Schiff, his son, who's a friend of mine, he is all about Bitcoin, loves Bitcoin, he's been buying Bitcoin, and he'll probably be in the Austin event coming up on July 8th at Spider House in Austin.
[02:15:28.404 --> 02:15:31.745]  Tickets still available, search online, and we're giving two away.
[02:15:32.245 --> 02:15:37.747]  On your show, Alex, I don't know how you're going to do that, but two lucky listeners are going to get tickets to the event, Alex!
[02:15:38.007 --> 02:15:39.528]  Well, it looks like two of the crew got a ticket.
[02:15:40.228 --> 02:15:43.650]  I don't know how I'm supposed to give... I love my listeners, but how am I supposed to give this ticket away?
[02:15:45.090 --> 02:15:46.991]  I love how you give me the responsibility.
[02:15:47.031 --> 02:15:48.972]  How about you just give me that 10,000 Bitcoin?
[02:15:50.813 --> 02:15:57.396]  Tell you what, you give me 10,000 Bitcoin like you tried, I promise I will distribute 80% of it to the listeners.
[02:15:58.459 --> 02:16:05.251]  But it's in a safe place, Alex, and I don't want to burden you with keeping track of it.
[02:16:05.291 --> 02:16:06.353]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:16:06.794 --> 02:16:08.357]  I apologize for 10 years ago.
[02:16:08.958 --> 02:16:11.082]  Now I will take the 10, I will take 1,000 Bitcoin.
[02:16:13.382 --> 02:16:31.995]  Just consider it as a friendly gesture on my behalf to Custodian and to safeguard those coins, Alex, and we'll revisit this at a time when I feel you're really mature enough to handle this type of responsibility, because it is a whopping big responsibility of about $350 million worth of Bitcoin.
[02:16:32.335 --> 02:16:38.380]  Well, if I haven't proven I have the responsibility now, I want to fund the operation with a small percentage of it, and I will promote Bitcoin with the rest.
[02:16:38.400 --> 02:16:40.581]  You need to give the Bitcoin to me.
[02:16:40.961 --> 02:16:42.302]  Thank you, Max Keiser, for being here today.
[02:16:43.684 --> 02:16:45.585]  All right, thank you, Max.
[02:16:45.625 --> 02:16:46.325]  Yes, sir.
[02:16:47.786 --> 02:16:51.007]  Info Wars is here because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:16:51.447 --> 02:16:53.988]  That's why it's been our motto for more than 25 years.
[02:16:54.088 --> 02:17:04.952]  And if you research even the UN's own admissions, over two billion people on planet Earth out of seven and a half billion have cognitive disabilities, lower IQ because of lack of iodine.
[02:17:05.032 --> 02:17:09.173]  That's why they work to make sure iodine isn't in the food, isn't in the salt anymore.
[02:17:09.253 --> 02:17:10.874]  Now, regular iodine that you find
[02:17:11.514 --> 02:17:16.135]  In food is bound to different minerals, and so it's hard for your body to absorb.
[02:17:16.575 --> 02:17:21.616]  But if you get the proper type of iodine, there's three types that are good for the body, it does amazing things.
[02:17:21.676 --> 02:17:22.837]  It's essential in the body.
[02:17:23.217 --> 02:17:25.417]  Well, we have our amazing Tri-Iodine.
[02:17:25.777 --> 02:17:30.378]  A big shipment came in, and so we're able to offer it at the lowest price ever, 60% off.
[02:17:30.438 --> 02:17:35.940]  That is Survival Shield X3, 60% off with three types of powerful iodine.
[02:17:36.080 --> 02:17:37.940]  Tri-Iodine is from a patented
[02:17:38.260 --> 02:17:39.902]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:17:39.922 --> 02:17:40.843]  My name is Stu Peters.
[02:17:40.883 --> 02:17:42.184]  You can find me at StuPeters.TV.
[02:17:42.504 --> 02:17:45.447]  Gone last week, I was in Texas, veterans and celebrity softball classic.
[02:17:59.160 --> 02:18:01.481]  What an incredible time that was.
[02:18:01.561 --> 02:18:03.822]  I did miss being here, though, with you guys.
[02:18:03.942 --> 02:18:05.063]  There's so much to cover.
[02:18:05.143 --> 02:18:07.664]  I'm looking at breaking news right now.
[02:18:07.724 --> 02:18:23.770]  We're trying to get Dr. Gene Ruby on the line to talk about some of this, but there are two companies that are so eerily connected, as we have now discovered that every system at the disposal of these globalists is being weaponized against you.
[02:18:24.470 --> 02:18:34.179]  And we're discovering now, we're finding out the complexity of the relationships, not only between individuals, not between, you know, Fauci and Gates, because we had those suspicions.
[02:18:35.179 --> 02:18:52.294]  And we're trying to get it out to the masses right now, we need your help with all of that, but also the collusion and concerted efforts from allied countries that we have now been able to clearly identify as adversaries of the United States, attackers of freedom, enemies of liberty, destroyers of justice, they're murderers, they're criminals, they're pedophiles, they're drug and human trafficking terrorists,
[02:18:53.027 --> 02:18:57.629]  And they're not, you know, living in caves in Afghanistan or beheading people in the desert on YouTube videos.
[02:18:58.270 --> 02:19:00.511]  They're living at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
[02:19:00.931 --> 02:19:03.752]  They're in the empty city of Washington, D.C.
[02:19:03.812 --> 02:19:04.273]  It's eerie.
[02:19:04.293 --> 02:19:05.073]  It's a ghost town.
[02:19:05.533 --> 02:19:10.696]  But we're getting now, as we start to look into this, it's the responsibility of people like myself.
[02:19:11.730 --> 02:19:17.416]  And just because of the curious nature of my investigative background, I always like to try to figure things out.
[02:19:17.457 --> 02:19:32.894]  And Dr. Jane Ruby, I've got to give her all of the credit, because as an international health economist, as somebody with 20 years of pharmaceutical research experience, she's not only just researching now the pharmaceuticals themselves, but why they are the way that they are.
[02:19:33.769 --> 02:19:34.850]  Why they're being hidden?
[02:19:34.930 --> 02:19:36.431]  Why they're being pushed so much?
[02:19:36.451 --> 02:19:41.155]  I mean, the curiosity amongst these doctors that are speaking out, the brave ones that we're hearing about.
[02:19:41.536 --> 02:19:44.858]  Dr. Carrie Medea, that's been on this program multiple times.
[02:19:45.299 --> 02:19:47.160]  I had her on the Stu Peters Show just recently.
[02:19:47.841 --> 02:19:48.982]  You know, Dr. Tenpenny.
[02:19:49.442 --> 02:19:50.523]  Dr. Simone Gold.
[02:19:50.963 --> 02:19:51.924]  Dr. Peter McCullough.
[02:19:51.944 --> 02:19:59.831]  I mean, the names that you are familiar with, and now Dr. Gene Ruby emerging on the scene as somebody who is responsibly opining on all of these things.
[02:20:00.231 --> 02:20:08.454]  And we're going to have her on here in just a moment to talk about the relationship of two companies that are extremely close to one another and it's going to shock you.
[02:20:09.075 --> 02:20:10.915]  We've been talking about this magnetism.
[02:20:12.076 --> 02:20:13.056]  It's not a phenomenon.
[02:20:13.096 --> 02:20:14.117]  It's not a conspiracy.
[02:20:14.717 --> 02:20:17.438]  Thousands of people are literally sticking stuff to their face.
[02:20:17.958 --> 02:20:19.299]  They're sticking stuff to their arms.
[02:20:19.479 --> 02:20:21.560]  Now we're seeing all the videos of magnetic meat.
[02:20:22.717 --> 02:20:24.138]  This isn't a conspiracy.
[02:20:24.178 --> 02:20:25.499]  The media wants you to believe that it is.
[02:20:25.519 --> 02:20:27.801]  You're going to get banned from everywhere if you mention it.
[02:20:27.881 --> 02:20:34.905]  Instagram, Facebook, all the CCP, communist-owned and propagandized social media outlets.
[02:20:34.925 --> 02:20:38.188]  You're going to be thrown off of there, obviously, immediately if you mention magnetism.
[02:20:39.188 --> 02:20:41.530]  But there's a certain company, and I'm hearing Dr. Jane Ruby.
[02:20:41.550 --> 02:20:43.251]  We got a hold of her so we can bring her on right now.
[02:20:44.192 --> 02:20:45.193]  There are two companies.
[02:20:45.233 --> 02:20:46.674]  Thank you, Dr. Jane, for being here.
[02:20:46.714 --> 02:20:47.394]  We really appreciate it.
[02:20:48.295 --> 02:20:50.036]  There's a company called Excel.
[02:20:50.888 --> 02:20:56.051]  And then there is, they're meddling in this technology that's behind this magnetofection.
[02:20:56.552 --> 02:21:04.316]  And the magnetofection that you have been breaking is what drives the mRNA through the body more rapidly.
[02:21:04.436 --> 02:21:11.161]  It's an easier form or more aggressive form of transmission through the body, which is why it's not localized to the arm anymore.
[02:21:11.181 --> 02:21:17.645]  But now we're finding people with these diagnoses like Guillain-Barré and other things, which we're going to be breaking here shortly as well.
[02:21:18.005 --> 02:21:19.706]  I mean, all this stuff is just coming across here.
[02:21:20.306 --> 02:21:25.910]  But they have an interesting relationship with another company of interest throughout this whole planned-demic.
[02:21:26.031 --> 02:21:28.352]  You uncovered this whole thing, called me from the airport.
[02:21:29.133 --> 02:21:31.335]  I want you to tell the Alex Jones listeners all about this.
[02:21:31.375 --> 02:21:40.241]  Folks, pay attention to this because this, you just, you have to take a look at the complexity of these relationships to really understand how deep the deep state is.
[02:21:40.802 --> 02:21:44.545]  How big the globalist grip is on this world.
[02:21:44.585 --> 02:21:45.065]  Dr. Jane.
[02:21:46.377 --> 02:21:47.098]  Yeah, thanks Stu.
[02:21:47.900 --> 02:21:49.583]  Let me start a little bit from the beginning.
[02:21:50.044 --> 02:21:58.239]  When all of those people started to approach you, and some of them me as well, on this magnetic phenomenon that's happening,
[02:21:58.706 --> 02:22:27.113]  I did a little bit of digging and looked to see if there was any kind of a relationship and that's where we came up with the company called Chemicelle that is located in Berlin and they have a very elegant website, very sophisticated with a huge list of chemicals that assist in adding magnetofection which is a way to target cells in the body or any animal to move the mRNA molecule into target cells, they call them target
[02:22:27.583 --> 02:22:28.663]  Any cell, actually.
[02:22:28.703 --> 02:22:51.949]  And so, after we aired that, we had a tip from a police detective in Berlin who advises us that when he went to look at that corporation, he found that the same address for Chemicell, same building, same operation, included the company TIB Mobile,
[02:22:52.449 --> 02:23:07.238]  Which is, and I previously reported, slightly mistakenly, that it was owned by a Christian Drosten, but it's actually owned by a long-term friend of his, named Olfort Lant, and he's the CEO of TIB Mobile.
[02:23:07.258 --> 02:23:17.824]  And the reason this is important is because this is the mobile company produces the PCR kits right now that are used worldwide, as well as other companies.
[02:23:18.585 --> 02:23:20.266]  And they are in the same facility
[02:23:20.746 --> 02:23:29.992]  As the company that produces a huge collection of magnetofection chemicals that assist with driving this mRNA into every cell in your body.
[02:23:31.353 --> 02:23:41.640]  And I want people to understand, if you're not familiar with Christian Drosten, you need to know that he is on the editorial board of the organization called Eurosurveillance.
[02:23:43.081 --> 02:23:47.085]  The UDRA surveillance, which is the equivalent of our U.S.
[02:23:47.145 --> 02:23:47.906]  VAERS system.
[02:23:48.306 --> 02:23:53.391]  This is another organization that advises European countries on health care policy.
[02:23:53.732 --> 02:23:57.135]  So he's on this editorial board, but he published his paper.
[02:23:57.475 --> 02:24:00.178]  Second author, coincidentally, was Alfred Lant.
[02:24:00.898 --> 02:24:12.465]  The CEO of Mobile that makes the PCR test kits on how people, organization, countries should use the PCR test even though it's an innovator who's now since died.
[02:24:13.466 --> 02:24:17.088]  Dr. Kerry Mullins has said the test is way too general.
[02:24:17.529 --> 02:24:21.191]  It will find COVID in anything if you run the cycles high enough.
[02:24:21.271 --> 02:24:27.615]  So we see this interlocking directorate and it's critically important that people understand this connection.
[02:24:28.676 --> 02:24:33.022]  So Christian Drosten and Olfert Land wrote this paper.
[02:24:33.323 --> 02:24:36.828]  When you think about it, they're editors of this organization.
[02:24:37.088 --> 02:24:40.513]  They actually published their own paper through their own organization.
[02:24:40.733 --> 02:24:41.815]  That's highly unethical.
[02:24:45.999 --> 02:24:47.780]  I don't understand how any of that is legal.
[02:24:48.580 --> 02:24:49.281]  How can it be?
[02:24:49.601 --> 02:25:02.788]  This is like me being the expert on something and then also working for a government agency that controls that particular industry and then pushing or lobbying to the government that I work for on behalf of the people my product.
[02:25:03.548 --> 02:25:09.011]  This would be like Mike Lindell being in charge of the pillow division at the Department of Health and Safety.
[02:25:09.031 --> 02:25:10.912]  I mean, it's just it's absolutely absurd.
[02:25:11.761 --> 02:25:12.862]  It's worse than that.
[02:25:13.262 --> 02:25:21.169]  If you have a journal that publishes papers on a peer review basis, that means that no scientist is above peer review.
[02:25:21.730 --> 02:25:24.892]  His or her work has to be scrutinized, criticized, rewritten.
[02:25:25.273 --> 02:25:27.595]  Many times they send the scientists back.
[02:25:28.175 --> 02:25:32.599]  In this particular case, the reviewers, the authors were their own reviewers.
[02:25:32.799 --> 02:25:34.661]  That's highly unethical.
[02:25:34.781 --> 02:25:35.602]  It's not done.
[02:25:36.122 --> 02:25:37.603]  Up is down, down is up, Stu.
[02:25:37.723 --> 02:25:38.224]  It's absurd.
[02:25:39.167 --> 02:25:49.891]  Yeah, I have a whistleblower that I'm going to be talking about here shortly who called me and it's in reference to some of those things, where this stuff is coming from and why it's in there.
[02:25:50.371 --> 02:25:57.794]  But there are so many questions that I have for you today and at the last minute you're making yourself available and I hope that you can stick around for the duration because
[02:25:58.254 --> 02:26:00.596]  There are a lot of messages inside of my telegram.
[02:26:00.916 --> 02:26:04.860]  I'm getting email after email of people who are experiencing vaccine injuries.
[02:26:04.920 --> 02:26:21.255]  Since we did Brittany Galvin on my show, who by the way if you're unfamiliar with who she is, if you're a listener of the Alex Jones Show and you don't know who Brittany Galvin is, this is a girl who she was the first patient to have a neurosurgeon that was brave enough to actually diagnose her with this Guillain-Barré
[02:26:21.895 --> 02:26:35.523]  And say that it was absolutely, unequivocally, 100% because of the Moderna shot that she contracted this very serious syndrome, which could leave her paralyzed for life and ultimately could absolutely kill her.
[02:26:36.224 --> 02:26:36.904]  Guillain-Barre.
[02:26:36.944 --> 02:26:39.146]  There are also people suffering with tremors.
[02:26:39.766 --> 02:26:46.470]  There's another person that I was introduced to through Instagram, which I'm not really big over there because it's owned by the CCP, but I was contacted through there.
[02:26:46.510 --> 02:26:47.971]  I checked the message requests.
[02:26:48.607 --> 02:26:51.929]  There are people with these tremors now that are having cold shivers.
[02:26:52.609 --> 02:26:54.450]  These are perfectly healthy people, folks.
[02:26:54.930 --> 02:26:58.092]  And this whistleblower coming forward is a pharmacist.
[02:26:58.112 --> 02:27:04.635]  We're going to talk about her and some of the things that she said, as well as a very serious case that you just told me about.
[02:27:04.695 --> 02:27:06.335]  And that's all coming up right after the break.
[02:27:06.376 --> 02:27:07.456]  Thank you so much for sticking around.
[02:27:07.476 --> 02:27:08.256]  My name is Stu Peters.
[02:27:08.276 --> 02:27:09.277]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:27:10.143 --> 02:27:10.664]  I love this.
[02:27:11.044 --> 02:27:13.887]  This is why I love doing this job, honestly.
[02:27:14.047 --> 02:27:20.193]  I left 18 years as an investigator tracking down violent fugitives, investigating criminals.
[02:27:20.714 --> 02:27:21.735]  Nothing has changed.
[02:27:21.875 --> 02:27:26.359]  Still investigating criminals, but now they just wear a different uniform.
[02:27:26.860 --> 02:27:28.141]  They're of a different class.
[02:27:28.581 --> 02:27:31.224]  They're all criminals and we're exposing them.
[02:27:31.324 --> 02:27:31.885]  I love it.
[02:27:33.279 --> 02:27:40.177]  I just, what keeps me motivated, what keeps me going, because believe me, there are days that are so incredibly challenging.
[02:27:40.928 --> 02:27:50.073]  So incredibly challenging to investigate every email that we get, to look into every bit of corruption, to try to figure out if there's a story behind this or that or this person.
[02:27:50.093 --> 02:28:06.643]  I mean, we're now talking about a Republican candidate in Florida, who apparently, according to Deanna Lorraine, who was on a Stu Peters show earlier today, threatened to have Ukrainian and Russian assassins track down his opponent and murder her.
[02:28:07.283 --> 02:28:21.153]  This is really going on, so please, please, please tell your sheep neighbors what is really going on in this world and direct them to the truth right here at InfoWars and over at my place at StuPeters.tv.
[02:28:21.193 --> 02:28:22.794]  Dr. Jane Ruby is joining us.
[02:28:22.834 --> 02:28:26.476]  We were just talking about something that is actually extremely huge.
[02:28:27.477 --> 02:28:34.182]  Understanding how heavy that information really is, that the company Chemicell
[02:28:35.640 --> 02:28:38.804]  These are the people meddling in this magnetofection technology.
[02:28:39.405 --> 02:28:46.214]  While everybody in the world is denying the reality that people are magnetized after they get these injections.
[02:28:47.239 --> 02:28:51.563]  Magnetized even after not getting the injections, but being around people who are.
[02:28:51.663 --> 02:28:54.445]  And we don't know what is shedding with these people right now.
[02:28:54.525 --> 02:29:01.491]  We don't know exactly what side effects or what symptoms you might experience through this shedding or this transmission.
[02:29:01.531 --> 02:29:08.778]  We do know that they told us that these things were going to be self-transmitting, that they were going to be basically contagious, that they were developing this years ago.
[02:29:09.378 --> 02:29:11.720]  But they want you to believe that none of this is true.
[02:29:11.740 --> 02:29:22.329]  They want you to ignore what your eyes are seeing, ignore what your ears are hearing, and completely disregard the thousands of self-recorded videos that you see on the CCP-controlled TikTok or over on Instagram.
[02:29:22.369 --> 02:29:23.030]  It's ridiculous.
[02:29:23.430 --> 02:29:33.518]  Chemicel, the company that is meddling in the technology for the Magnetofection, which Dr. Jane Ruby broke and exposed, was intentionally added to these vaccines.
[02:29:33.819 --> 02:29:36.241]  Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, all of them.
[02:29:37.061 --> 02:29:40.404]  Sue, the numbers are exploding of all kinds of what we know as autoimmune diseases.
[02:30:05.240 --> 02:30:09.724]  MS or multiple sclerosis is one of those autoimmune diseases.
[02:30:10.125 --> 02:30:13.748]  In this disease, the body attacks its own myelin.
[02:30:14.168 --> 02:30:18.412]  Your myelin is the sheath covering over your brain and spinal cord.
[02:30:18.452 --> 02:30:28.782]  Imagine if you have a process that starts multiple sclerosis and then you add on top of that booster shots of these injections.
[02:30:29.382 --> 02:30:30.563]  To advance the MS.
[02:30:30.643 --> 02:30:42.248]  No wonder people like Brittany, who has another form of autoimmune disease, Guillain-Barre syndrome, no wonder she's having trouble walking, a 30-something-year-old mother of three.
[02:30:43.248 --> 02:30:48.110]  What basically happens is we know the spike proteins are going everywhere.
[02:30:48.451 --> 02:30:55.874]  We've been told that this injection doesn't leave the injection site, and yet at the same time we're reading all kinds of reports
[02:30:56.314 --> 02:30:56.754]  Thank you.
[02:31:12.063 --> 02:31:24.086]  When added to the lipid nanoparticles actually drives, it's a stronger delivery system to get this to every cell in the body because it breaks through natural barriers.
[02:31:24.126 --> 02:31:27.107]  The most famous barrier everyone knows is the blood-brain barrier.
[02:31:27.407 --> 02:31:40.010]  Not everything is supposed to get through the brain as you can imagine, but putting this nanoparticle and charging it with magnetofection ensures that it goes past those lipid barriers and that's what's happening here.
[02:31:40.590 --> 02:31:50.857]  Stu, I wanted to also share with you and the viewers that something else is happening, especially that we're being lied to about the fact that these are supposedly not leaving the injection site.
[02:31:51.377 --> 02:32:00.483]  There was a report, and we're still getting more information on it, that there are changes in the blood, the shape and morphology of your blood cells.
[02:32:01.424 --> 02:32:07.548]  I provided your producers with a photograph that shows four different
[02:32:08.228 --> 02:32:08.749]  We're good to go.
[02:32:23.467 --> 02:32:23.707]  Thank you.
[02:32:43.340 --> 02:32:45.861]  Two right now with two injection series.
[02:32:46.781 --> 02:32:53.722]  And so they looked at that person's blood several days after they were injected with the second shot.
[02:32:54.702 --> 02:33:03.064]  What you're seeing in the picture to the right, in the upper right-hand corner, are the blood cells several days after the shot.
[02:33:03.104 --> 02:33:07.325]  You can see that they're not smooth and round the way red blood cells are supposed to be.
[02:33:09.193 --> 02:33:10.915]  I've seen some stuff going on on the screen.
[02:33:11.996 --> 02:33:16.020]  We're operating out of a different studio here today, so I think that there's just some issues pulling that up.
[02:33:16.721 --> 02:33:22.247]  But I will make sure that we get that up on the website as well, so that people can understand what it is that you're referring to.
[02:33:22.287 --> 02:33:24.730]  But they definitely change your blood cells.
[02:33:25.411 --> 02:33:26.992]  We're being lied to in that regard.
[02:33:27.132 --> 02:33:29.455]  These things actually change your blood cells.
[02:33:29.715 --> 02:33:31.097]  They damage cells.
[02:33:32.901 --> 02:33:34.422]  Yes, that's what I'm explaining.
[02:33:34.502 --> 02:33:39.246]  They change the shape, which is the morphology of your red blood cells.
[02:33:39.726 --> 02:33:48.973]  It looks like the nucleus has been damaged because you see it's when you get to see the photo, the nucleus of the red blood cells becomes very whitened and enlarged.
[02:33:49.293 --> 02:33:52.235]  That tells me there's a high inflammatory process going on.
[02:33:52.795 --> 02:33:54.717]  And then in a third picture,
[02:33:55.154 --> 02:34:09.106]  You can see a lot of white specks that are surrounding the plasma around those red blood cells and the blood cells themselves and those are the lipid nanoparticles that are just profusely and ubiquitously throughout the bloodstream.
[02:34:09.167 --> 02:34:18.495]  So again, you know, and then the fourth picture just for future reference is the red blood cells with these, it looks like embedded particles in them.
[02:34:19.396 --> 02:34:30.467]  Don't tell me that this material that's being injected from these shots stays at the site of injection, which is the upper arm, the deltoid muscle, because they're not.
[02:34:30.487 --> 02:34:32.108]  25 people died as a result of
[02:34:35.391 --> 02:34:38.513]  Of the swine flu vaccination program.
[02:34:38.873 --> 02:34:39.553]  25 people.
[02:34:39.633 --> 02:34:41.354]  It was immediately halted.
[02:34:41.374 --> 02:34:42.975]  We've talked about this at nauseam.
[02:34:43.055 --> 02:34:46.257]  I know that you guys have this information, but this has to sink in.
[02:34:46.617 --> 02:34:48.618]  This has to resonate with the people that you know.
[02:34:49.159 --> 02:34:52.440]  I'm thinking about standing right outside of pharmacies.
[02:34:52.460 --> 02:34:56.402]  I'm thinking about standing right outside of the CVS with a big sign and just warning people.
[02:34:56.423 --> 02:35:00.064]  I feel like it's almost my duty to stand there and tell people exactly what's going on.
[02:35:00.785 --> 02:35:04.547]  And we only have about five seconds left here in this segment, but if you have something quick.
[02:35:05.549 --> 02:35:14.676]  When the famous antidepressant drug Celexa was being tested in animal studies in the 80s, six beagle dogs died of heart attacks.
[02:35:15.096 --> 02:35:20.940]  Stu, they shut that program down for six dead dogs before they even got to humans.
[02:35:21.280 --> 02:35:25.583]  We have over 6,000, and that's a conservative estimate, dead in the United States.
[02:35:25.643 --> 02:35:26.364]  What are we doing?
[02:35:27.222 --> 02:35:28.763]  Could be 60,000 or 600,000.
[02:35:29.143 --> 02:35:36.405]  If you follow the Harvard study, we know that 1% or less of these things are actually accurately reported to VAERS because it's a very complicated system.
[02:35:36.665 --> 02:35:39.126]  And they're screwing with those numbers over there as well.
[02:35:39.146 --> 02:35:43.608]  I'm going to talk to you about why this is all happening and where the doctors are coming up next.
[02:35:43.768 --> 02:35:44.208]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:35:44.228 --> 02:35:45.068]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:35:45.088 --> 02:35:45.708]  My name is Stu Peter.
[02:35:46.008 --> 02:35:47.649]  StuPetersStuPeters.tv.
[02:35:47.709 --> 02:35:48.169]  Check me out.
[02:35:48.209 --> 02:35:48.869]  I'd appreciate it.
[02:35:48.909 --> 02:35:49.910]  Come on over anytime.
[02:35:50.490 --> 02:35:53.271]  You know, much similar, we do nothing but truth.
[02:35:53.631 --> 02:35:56.552]  And although the topics may overlap every once in a while,
[02:35:57.092 --> 02:36:03.038]  Alex can't keep track of me, nor can I keep track of what he's doing, and if I'm being redundant or repetitive, I apologize.
[02:36:03.439 --> 02:36:13.088]  Breaking over there right now, today a senator in Minnesota here actually sent a threatening email to a voter that requested a forensic audit of the 2020 election here.
[02:36:13.269 --> 02:36:15.351]  Very polite, but very persistent.
[02:36:15.831 --> 02:36:19.475]  She sent an email to Minnesota Senator Jim Carlson.
[02:36:20.175 --> 02:36:29.221]  In response to her requesting a forensic audit of the 2020 election here in the state of Minnesota, this guy at 1247 a.m.
[02:36:29.561 --> 02:36:36.366]  Now, I don't know about you, I'm sleeping at 1247 a.m., but conveniently, that's right around bar close here in the state of Minnesota as well.
[02:36:36.406 --> 02:36:43.871]  I don't know what Jim Carlson is into, if the senator was on a drunken stupor or what he was doing, but he starts emailing her back at 1247 a.m.
[02:36:45.692 --> 02:36:48.958]  It ended up with threatening emails from him to her.
[02:36:49.038 --> 02:36:50.781]  That story is at StuPeters.TV.
[02:36:51.101 --> 02:36:52.163]  I know where you live.
[02:36:52.183 --> 02:36:53.846]  I know everything about you.
[02:36:53.946 --> 02:36:55.329]  I know where your family is.
[02:36:56.903 --> 02:36:58.384]  Scary world that we live in right now.
[02:36:58.484 --> 02:37:13.090]  And you know, these people that are supposed to be charged with the responsibility of protecting you and the voice of the people, their very job is to go and represent the voices of their constituents, to take care of the concerns that their constituents have.
[02:37:13.550 --> 02:37:19.393]  And rather than that, instead, he turns around and says that he knows where she lives and that she better stop emailing him.
[02:37:19.893 --> 02:37:20.434]  Very polite.
[02:37:21.294 --> 02:37:23.976]  You'll see all the emails over there at StuPeters.tv.
[02:37:23.996 --> 02:37:25.517]  We have Dr. Jane Ruby on here.
[02:37:25.537 --> 02:37:27.358]  We were talking about MS before we went to break.
[02:37:27.678 --> 02:37:32.801]  Two or six beagle dogs died as a result of an injection.
[02:37:32.881 --> 02:37:35.223]  They immediately halted that vaccine process.
[02:37:36.604 --> 02:37:38.024]  25 people die in a swine flu.
[02:37:38.665 --> 02:37:39.845]  They immediately halt that.
[02:37:39.885 --> 02:37:52.052]  We have upwards of possibly 600,000 people injured or dead as a result of this inoculation, this vaccine, which we're going to talk about specifically exactly how hidden the contents of this thing really are.
[02:37:52.613 --> 02:37:54.874]  But first, you wanted to touch a little bit more on this MS.
[02:37:56.528 --> 02:38:13.094]  I believe I got word that the producers were able to locate that photo that is really helpful showing the differences in the blood, the red blood cells of people who have been injected with any of these four injections, Stu.
[02:38:13.694 --> 02:38:19.176]  And what we're seeing in the upper left-hand corner is a collection of normal red blood cells.
[02:38:19.196 --> 02:38:21.697]  They're nice and round, they're healthy, they're plump.
[02:38:22.617 --> 02:38:28.341]  They're filled with the red ferritin iron that carries your oxygen.
[02:38:29.262 --> 02:38:43.851]  In the upper right-hand corner, you're seeing the beginning several days after the second injection of one of these injections, and you can see that the shape is changing, becoming very abnormal, spotty around the edges.
[02:38:43.891 --> 02:38:44.711]  They're not round.
[02:38:44.752 --> 02:38:46.773]  The inner nucleus looks inflamed.
[02:38:47.573 --> 02:38:48.934]  It's white and widened.
[02:38:49.475 --> 02:38:56.941]  And then the lower left-hand corner, you're seeing probably after about five days, this is by, like I said before, dark field microscopy.
[02:38:57.381 --> 02:39:02.885]  In the lower left-hand corner, you see a lot of these dots and kind of irregularities on the outside.
[02:39:02.925 --> 02:39:05.147]  These are the red blood cells fighting for their lives.
[02:39:05.648 --> 02:39:10.391]  In the bottom right corner, you see all these white specks.
[02:39:10.451 --> 02:39:13.053]  Those are believed to be the lipid nanoparticles.
[02:39:13.474 --> 02:39:16.196]  Don't tell me that these injections stay at the injection site.
[02:39:16.796 --> 02:39:20.177]  And they're not only surrounding the red blood cells, they're damaging them.
[02:39:20.437 --> 02:39:22.378]  You can see an inflammatory process.
[02:39:23.018 --> 02:39:25.399]  There's like a war on for our blood.
[02:39:26.079 --> 02:39:32.481]  We are verifying with the person who ran these tests and hopefully get them on the show soon, if possible.
[02:39:32.501 --> 02:39:36.442]  And I really want to send my thanks to the producers for getting this up and running.
[02:39:36.462 --> 02:39:38.503]  I think it's a really powerful photograph that
[02:39:38.923 --> 02:39:40.985]  Yeah, they're incredible.
[02:39:41.005 --> 02:39:42.706]  And you're right, they're lying.
[02:39:43.887 --> 02:39:57.159]  This should be the duty of medical professionals, of doctors, of pharmacists, of people, anybody that's responsible for injecting this stuff into the bloodstream of unsuspecting Americans who have no idea.
[02:39:57.539 --> 02:40:00.221]  You know, you can't really necessarily blame them.
[02:40:00.482 --> 02:40:01.242]  They have no idea.
[02:40:01.282 --> 02:40:04.325]  They go home after a long day at work, they turn on the TV, they listen to their
[02:40:04.865 --> 02:40:05.545]  I don't know.
[02:40:27.976 --> 02:40:30.198]  Similar messages verbatim.
[02:40:30.558 --> 02:40:32.719]  They're saying the same words.
[02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:35.582]  So you can't blame these people, but what about these medical professionals?
[02:40:35.862 --> 02:40:44.728]  Why are doctors, Dr. Gene Ruby, continuing to give this thing to people knowing that this information is out there?
[02:40:45.188 --> 02:40:47.290]  Knowing that 5,000 or 5,500 or 6,000 are reported to VAERS.
[02:40:51.004 --> 02:40:53.146]  They don't even have to take the Harvard study into account.
[02:40:53.286 --> 02:40:57.811]  I mean, if 6,000 is the number, we're stopping something for six beagles, for crying out loud.
[02:40:58.391 --> 02:41:00.113]  Why are they still injecting these people?
[02:41:01.314 --> 02:41:02.956]  Sue, this is a very good question.
[02:41:03.476 --> 02:41:04.618]  I'm glad you brought it up.
[02:41:04.858 --> 02:41:06.259]  You touched on something earlier.
[02:41:06.680 --> 02:41:11.985]  People have been relying on the good faith and trust in physicians and nurses.
[02:41:12.506 --> 02:41:12.886]  Thank you.
[02:41:25.419 --> 02:41:30.282]  So many physicians are just blindly telling their patients, oh, go get the shot.
[02:41:31.723 --> 02:41:33.264]  It's perfectly safe for everyone.
[02:41:33.744 --> 02:41:37.866]  I've told them to push back on their doctors and ask, well, is there anybody this isn't safe for?
[02:41:38.366 --> 02:41:41.968]  Because, Stu, there's nothing in the world that's 100% safe.
[02:41:42.389 --> 02:41:53.195]  So I've coined the term zombie doctors, and I've sent out pictures of doctors, they're zombies, drenched in blood, holding up needles, and coming after you, because doctors have a responsibility
[02:41:53.895 --> 02:41:57.377]  To look at the literature before recommending something.
[02:41:57.697 --> 02:42:01.158]  And to answer your question, Stu, there are only two reasons why this is happening.
[02:42:01.919 --> 02:42:05.680]  One, doctors are ignorant or lazy and they're not doing the research.
[02:42:05.700 --> 02:42:13.624]  They're not looking at the same studies that I can find in the public domain to look at the dangers and look at what this injection is really made of.
[02:42:14.164 --> 02:42:18.906]  And that is dereliction of duty and the highest order of a violation of the Hippocratic Oath ever.
[02:42:19.886 --> 02:42:25.571]  Or even worse, in my mind, although I think they're both equally worse, these doctors are being paid.
[02:42:25.991 --> 02:42:27.092]  How are they being paid?
[02:42:27.392 --> 02:42:29.294]  They're being paid, they're incentivized.
[02:42:29.639 --> 02:42:50.874]  by the pharma companies through grants and these things are all kind of hidden and wrapped around and you know and they get around federal regs or I've seen insurance companies like Blue Cross and Blue Shield actually provide bonuses for a certain percentage of the doctor's patient population inoculated.
[02:42:50.914 --> 02:42:56.418]  Sue, these are in direct violation of the Nuremberg, all 10 of the Nuremberg Codes.
[02:42:56.818 --> 02:42:57.678]  And it's got to stop.
[02:42:57.718 --> 02:43:03.400]  And I'm calling attention to zombie doctors because I want doctors to start taking responsibility.
[02:43:03.801 --> 02:43:13.364]  My own doctor down here, when I moved to Florida just recently, great doctor, great examination at the very end, said, you know, you really ought to think about taking the vaccination.
[02:43:13.804 --> 02:43:24.746]  Well, she said that to the wrong person, and when I laid it all out for her in about 90 seconds, her reply, she had a look of shock on her face, and her reply was, oh my, I guess I better go back and do some reading.
[02:43:25.146 --> 02:43:30.167]  Totally oblivious to the fact that this was not a vaccine, and drinking the Kool-Aid of the CDC.
[02:43:30.187 --> 02:43:33.448]  Everybody comes on to take care of their personal health.
[02:43:34.008 --> 02:43:37.068]  These are the people that are so incredibly entrusted.
[02:43:37.409 --> 02:43:39.749]  And let me just illustrate how entrusted they are.
[02:43:40.561 --> 02:43:53.069]  If I put a glass of water in front of you, Dr. Gene, and I said, there is a 1% chance that this is poison and you're going to drink it and you're going to die, you of course would not drink that glass of water.
[02:43:53.909 --> 02:44:04.036]  So why in the hell would you allow somebody, a total stranger, to inject something directly into you that has the same or worse odds?
[02:44:04.818 --> 02:44:06.139]  Because they're wearing a lab coat.
[02:44:06.659 --> 02:44:09.120]  That is why people have entrusted these doctors.
[02:44:09.401 --> 02:44:29.052]  And I'm telling you, if what you're saying is true, and if we find out that these doctors are being compensated, we already know it to be true, but if it can be proven, and if the media will grab a hold of this, and if 300 million people or more in this country can come to the realization that these doctors have been intentionally lying to them for money, can you imagine the falling out?
[02:44:29.372 --> 02:44:31.673]  Can you imagine what might happen to these doctors?
[02:44:31.733 --> 02:44:32.934]  My God, I would have to pray for them.
[02:44:33.900 --> 02:44:39.644]  Sue, doctors are obligated to report all money they receive from pharma companies in something called the Sunshine Act.
[02:44:39.984 --> 02:44:41.124]  So it's very easy to prove.
[02:44:41.164 --> 02:44:44.166]  And what I'm worried about, as we close here, are the children.
[02:44:44.506 --> 02:44:50.790]  These pediatricians that are coming out and saying, yes, inject them as low as birth, two or three months old.
[02:44:51.131 --> 02:44:52.211]  Sue, this has got to stop.
[02:44:52.251 --> 02:44:53.312]  We've got to save the children.
[02:44:54.389 --> 02:44:59.472]  Well, we're not closing because I've got amazing information on a whistleblower.
[02:45:00.552 --> 02:45:05.935]  She is a pharmacist, okay, and she has come forward.
[02:45:05.955 --> 02:45:13.659]  I'm not ready to release what she has, but there's an amazing phenomenon going on here that she told me about, and I want to talk to you about that.
[02:45:13.699 --> 02:45:16.901]  If you have the time to stick around, I would like to have you on for just one more segment.
[02:45:16.921 --> 02:45:18.021]  Dr. Jane Ruby joins us.
[02:45:18.782 --> 02:45:20.723]  This is the Alex Jones Show on InfoWars.
[02:45:20.783 --> 02:45:22.243]  My name is Stu Peters at StuPeters.TV.
[02:45:22.303 --> 02:45:23.284]  We'll be back in a second.
[02:45:23.784 --> 02:45:25.787]  Please come and find me at StuPeters.tv.
[02:45:25.848 --> 02:45:30.715]  I love you guys and I really appreciate you having me here every Friday in this fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:45:30.735 --> 02:45:31.716]  My name is Stu Peters.
[02:45:31.776 --> 02:45:39.248]  If there's one thing that we have failed to do, I think, in times past, in my humble and honest opinion,
[02:45:40.900 --> 02:46:00.355]  One of our biggest downfalls, Dr. Jane, is that we have failed to give credit to the enemy for their ability to plan, for their ability to orchestrate, for their ability to stick together, to maintain a narrative, to project propaganda, to slowly infiltrate every aspect of our lives without firing a single shot.
[02:46:00.735 --> 02:46:01.835]  Without being detected.
[02:46:01.995 --> 02:46:02.996]  Completely quiet.
[02:46:03.036 --> 02:46:12.238]  They're like little termites and they have been gnawing away at the foundation of this country for an incredibly long time and now they're going after our kids.
[02:46:13.538 --> 02:46:19.340]  And when, you know, these people say that this emergency use authorization goes down to as young as age 12,
[02:46:21.184 --> 02:46:25.186]  There are certain pharmacists because there are many of us who are a part of this great awakening.
[02:46:25.206 --> 02:46:28.128]  There are many of us whose eyes have been incredibly open.
[02:46:28.208 --> 02:46:30.809]  I had no idea that a lot of this stuff was going on.
[02:46:30.849 --> 02:46:31.450]  I really didn't.
[02:46:32.210 --> 02:46:36.573]  And if there's one thing that I can credit Donald J. Trump for, it was making me question everything.
[02:46:37.653 --> 02:46:39.374]  And I give him a lot of credit for a lot of things.
[02:46:39.394 --> 02:46:45.938]  That's just one of the biggest things I think is that I literally question everything and I consider absolutely everything to be a possibility.
[02:46:46.767 --> 02:46:52.252]  But this little infestation of these termites has now become a catastrophic complication for our kids.
[02:46:53.173 --> 02:47:06.984]  As parents and grandparents are literally walking these kids straight into a CVS, straight into a Walgreens or whatever pharmacy you go to, straight into a doctor's office to grab this jab because they're afraid of COVID.
[02:47:07.005 --> 02:47:08.065]  They're afraid of COVID-19.
[02:47:09.531 --> 02:47:11.973]  You have told us before, viruses burn down, not up.
[02:47:12.414 --> 02:47:14.876]  As far as I'm concerned, the whole COVID thing is dead.
[02:47:14.956 --> 02:47:15.376]  It's gone.
[02:47:15.456 --> 02:47:16.057]  It's over with.
[02:47:16.097 --> 02:47:17.238]  There is no pandemic.
[02:47:17.930 --> 02:47:43.153]  And when people start suing these states, when people start suing their governors, their attorneys general, for enforcing these lockdown mandates, when they start suing them for being fired from their jobs, for refusing to get inoculated, when they start suing these people, the one thing that they will have to do when they subpoena these attorneys general and these governors is the one thing that I would encourage them to do, and Lewis Ewing would also encourage this,
[02:47:43.853 --> 02:47:47.855]  They have to prove that there is an active pandemic.
[02:47:49.196 --> 02:47:50.557]  And I don't know that they can do that.
[02:47:50.597 --> 02:47:52.898]  But nonetheless, we have these people going in.
[02:47:52.938 --> 02:47:58.020]  And so, Dr. Jane, I was contacted in my ProtonMail by a pharmacist.
[02:47:58.060 --> 02:48:00.942]  I got to be really careful here because I don't want to expose this person.
[02:48:00.982 --> 02:48:02.643]  We're talking hidden cameras and all kinds of stuff.
[02:48:03.883 --> 02:48:10.426]  But this person who originally contacted me has been working at a pharmacy and has been jabbing people.
[02:48:12.185 --> 02:48:20.994]  As she woke up and started realizing what it is that's going on, and it was, I'll take credit for it, she found my telegram channel and she found you.
[02:48:22.235 --> 02:48:24.397]  And so she's like, whoa, this is really going on.
[02:48:24.457 --> 02:48:32.005]  And she started doing her own research and she found out, oh my holy smokes, and it really blew her mind that she has been participating in this and she was ready to walk.
[02:48:32.985 --> 02:48:39.028]  And, you know, she was considering walking and then she was considering participating in some way, shape or form.
[02:48:39.628 --> 02:48:45.931]  And she came to the conclusion on her own, if I were to leave right now, somebody else would just fill my shoes.
[02:48:46.591 --> 02:48:48.432]  So I'm going to stay and I'm going to do the right thing.
[02:48:48.472 --> 02:48:50.853]  In every war and every battle, there is collateral damage.
[02:48:50.873 --> 02:48:52.594]  There are innocent people that die and perish.
[02:48:52.614 --> 02:48:55.255]  There are casualties that are untargeted people.
[02:48:55.995 --> 02:48:56.096]  I'm
[02:49:10.931 --> 02:49:20.260]  In conversation with her, she told me that she learned yesterday that there are 20 pharmacists at her chain or whatever that are leaving.
[02:49:20.921 --> 02:49:22.502]  And then I started doing some research on that.
[02:49:22.903 --> 02:49:28.388]  There was an article just yesterday, I don't remember where I saw it, but 20 CVS people are leaving.
[02:49:28.988 --> 02:49:34.754]  There's whistleblowers coming out and saying, you know, that we don't know what we're injecting in these people.
[02:49:35.652 --> 02:49:36.994]  I want to talk about something.
[02:49:37.494 --> 02:49:40.958]  I want to ask you about these inserts, whatever they're called.
[02:49:41.018 --> 02:49:48.287]  These pieces of paper that come inside of the box or the lot where these injections are sent to the pharmacists
[02:49:49.361 --> 02:49:54.185]  These things, just like any other medication, have an insert, and that insert is supposed to list ingredients.
[02:49:54.265 --> 02:49:57.247]  I'm being told that they are intentionally blank, and I've seen them.
[02:49:57.868 --> 02:49:58.228]  They are.
[02:49:58.288 --> 02:49:58.789]  They're blank.
[02:49:59.049 --> 02:50:00.710]  Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson.
[02:50:00.770 --> 02:50:02.412]  How important is this piece of paper?
[02:50:02.432 --> 02:50:12.860]  Am I just overthinking this, or is that alarming to you as a pharmaceutical researcher expert that these things are blank?
[02:50:15.183 --> 02:50:22.032]  Stu, when people understand what that piece of paper is, they are going to be, I hope, very angry.
[02:50:22.052 --> 02:50:26.257]  That piece of paper is called the package insert.
[02:50:26.697 --> 02:50:32.825]  That's the little piece of paper that most of us throw out when we open up our new aspirin or Advil bottle.
[02:50:35.888 --> 02:50:37.289]  That's called the package insert.
[02:50:37.329 --> 02:50:46.960]  That's actually a legal document that I can tell you from the beginning is hammered out between the pharmaceutical company and the FDA.
[02:50:47.820 --> 02:50:56.430]  Every word, I'm telling you every number, every punctuation mark is negotiated and approved by the FDA or it cannot be in that
[02:50:57.105 --> 02:50:57.485]  Insert.
[02:50:57.885 --> 02:51:00.046]  And it is based on the studies.
[02:51:00.986 --> 02:51:11.009]  And that package insert, if you look the next time of any other drug, you will see that there are studies in there with graphs, there are warnings to doctors, there are warnings to patients.
[02:51:11.369 --> 02:51:14.250]  The package insert is a legal document.
[02:51:14.350 --> 02:51:23.372]  The fact that these vials of these four injections are being circulated throughout the United States and in the world with blank pieces of paper
[02:51:24.106 --> 02:51:25.254]  Is an outrage.
[02:51:25.556 --> 02:51:27.066]  It is a dereliction of duty.
[02:51:27.705 --> 02:51:38.694]  It is the most incredibly corrupt thing that is going on, that the FDA is not insisting on even a temporary package insert.
[02:51:38.895 --> 02:51:40.136]  It's also called the label.
[02:51:40.196 --> 02:51:42.137]  The label is a legal document.
[02:51:43.198 --> 02:51:52.846]  To have nothing at all, that means you have no information on the lot number, you have no information on safety, you have no information on efficacy, how efficacious it was.
[02:51:53.267 --> 02:51:55.989]  All we have are public statements, and these pharma companies
[02:51:56.328 --> 02:51:57.008]  We're good to go.
[02:52:16.077 --> 02:52:27.021]  These people's names are clearly printed, publicly discoverable, right on the patent information that's behind the mRNA technology, that's behind this magnetofection, and that's behind the injection itself.
[02:52:27.101 --> 02:52:28.421]  Bill Gates, Anthony Fauci.
[02:52:28.741 --> 02:52:37.784]  The same people, at least one of them, who funded the lab that I, and everybody else that's truthful, was called a liar for speculating that that was the lab in Wuhan where it leaked from.
[02:52:38.144 --> 02:52:39.805]  Now I'm speculating and have almost...
[02:52:40.445 --> 02:52:43.687]  Pretty positive circumstantial evidence that this thing was engineered.
[02:52:43.928 --> 02:52:48.631]  This is why Fauci was consistently emailing a woman by the name of Christina Cassetti.
[02:52:48.931 --> 02:52:52.634]  Christina Cassetti spent the last eight years of her life in Italy doing guess what?
[02:52:52.914 --> 02:52:53.975]  Engineering viruses.
[02:52:54.355 --> 02:52:59.879]  Why was he sending her chlorine dioxide or nitric oxide and saying, hey, I need you to take care of this.
[02:52:59.939 --> 02:53:00.779]  Make this go away.
[02:53:01.120 --> 02:53:02.681]  It was a viable treatment.
[02:53:02.841 --> 02:53:03.761]  It was a cure.
[02:53:04.182 --> 02:53:07.304]  Essentially, it made the SARS-CoV-2 virus die.
[02:53:07.604 --> 02:53:08.765]  It stopped it from spreading.
[02:53:09.165 --> 02:53:11.286]  These are the very people that are responsible.
[02:53:11.346 --> 02:53:21.990]  So, going back to the leaflets, the inserts, could it be possible that, you mentioned that everything is negotiated or approved by the FDA that goes into these things, every punctuation mark, every space, every letter.
[02:53:22.550 --> 02:53:26.991]  Is it possible that these are left blank because of the fact that this doesn't have FDA approval?
[02:53:27.051 --> 02:53:31.473]  And do you expect this thing, in about a minute or less, to ever eventually get FDA approval?
[02:53:31.613 --> 02:53:32.233]  Oh yeah, there she is.
[02:53:32.273 --> 02:53:33.654]  There's one of those pharmacists right there.
[02:53:34.274 --> 02:53:37.915]  This thing is 100% when she opens it up, it's 100% blank.
[02:53:38.255 --> 02:53:41.296]  Will this thing be FDA approved, Dr. Ruby?
[02:53:41.717 --> 02:53:48.179]  My opinion is that the reason these are blank is because, Stu, they didn't do the safety studies in humans.
[02:53:48.619 --> 02:53:51.380]  They didn't run the pharmacokinetic studies on humans.
[02:53:51.760 --> 02:53:59.163]  Pharmacokinetics are the study of, there are about 100 tests in there, but there are about 12 standard ones we expect to see in a package insert.
[02:53:59.563 --> 02:54:01.945]  And that is what happens to the drug when it goes in your body?
[02:54:02.245 --> 02:54:02.946]  Where does it go?
[02:54:03.006 --> 02:54:03.966]  Where does it concentrate?
[02:54:04.006 --> 02:54:05.267]  How does your body break it down?
[02:54:05.888 --> 02:54:06.748]  How is it absorbed?
[02:54:07.049 --> 02:54:07.949]  How is it excreted?
[02:54:07.969 --> 02:54:08.650]  Through urine?
[02:54:08.870 --> 02:54:09.671]  Through feces?
[02:54:09.871 --> 02:54:10.571]  Through sweat?
[02:54:11.072 --> 02:54:23.561]  All that information is incredibly important and that's why it's not in there and she's showing you a blank piece of paper because they don't have the information or they have it and they're not sharing it because it's bad.
[02:54:24.441 --> 02:54:25.122]  Prove me wrong.
[02:54:26.548 --> 02:54:28.030]  Owen Troyer is coming up next.
[02:54:28.070 --> 02:54:30.053]  Dr. Jane Ruby, thank you so much for your time.
[02:54:30.073 --> 02:54:31.354]  Go ahead, what were you going to say?
[02:54:31.374 --> 02:54:33.457]  I just wanted to answer your second question.
[02:54:33.477 --> 02:54:36.120]  I do believe they will be approved.
[02:54:36.220 --> 02:54:40.306]  I'm incredibly frightened about that because the corruption is not going to end, Stu.
[02:54:42.367 --> 02:54:42.887]  Unbelievable.
[02:54:43.707 --> 02:54:45.048]  Dr. Jane Ruby, thank you so much.
[02:54:45.068 --> 02:54:48.089]  You can email her, by the way, anytime if you want to blow the whistle on some of this stuff.
[02:54:48.129 --> 02:54:49.909]  DrJaneRuby at ProtonMail.com.
[02:54:49.929 --> 02:54:51.950]  You can also find her at DrJaneRuby.com.
[02:54:52.470 --> 02:54:53.010]  Thank you so much.
[02:54:53.090 --> 02:54:55.171]  Owen Schroer is coming up next with The War Room.
[02:54:55.191 --> 02:54:57.211]  I've heard that it's going to be an incredibly exciting show.
[02:54:57.611 --> 02:55:00.572]  Please find me over at StuPeters.TV.
[02:55:01.092 --> 02:55:02.733]  Check out that story that we did today.
[02:55:02.753 --> 02:55:06.194]  This is absolutely unbelievable, aside from all the medical tyranny.
[02:55:07.293 --> 02:55:17.999]  Aside from Republican candidates in Florida threatening a hit squad, assassinations, assassins from Russia and Ukraine to go take out a political opponent.
[02:55:18.059 --> 02:55:27.404]  Aside from all that, we now have voters, constituents politely reaching out, asking for somebody to consider a forensic audit of the 2020 election.
[02:55:27.464 --> 02:55:28.745]  I don't know why they might be doing that.
[02:55:29.245 --> 02:55:30.626]  There was no questions there, was there?
[02:55:31.026 --> 02:55:32.667]  Simply asking, could we please
[02:55:33.347 --> 02:55:34.008]  Investigate this.
[02:55:34.048 --> 02:55:36.510]  Could we have a forensic audit of the vote here in the state of Minnesota?
[02:55:36.530 --> 02:55:40.494]  We want to make sure that these elections are full of integrity and transparent.
[02:55:40.554 --> 02:55:41.875]  Instead, she got threatened.
[02:55:42.256 --> 02:55:43.877]  That whole story is at StuPeters.tv.
[02:55:43.957 --> 02:55:47.020]  I hope to see you guys again next Friday right here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:55:47.040 --> 02:55:47.521]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:55:47.541 --> 02:55:48.622]  Owen Schroer is up next.
[02:55:53.291 --> 02:55:55.652]  Nascent, sodium, and potassium.
[02:55:56.253 --> 02:56:04.718]  Three forms of pure elemental iodine that went together, fused together to create what is called stable iodine.
[02:56:04.778 --> 02:56:13.343]  Now I'm not a chemist, I'm not a scientist, but years ago when X3 became our bestseller we went to top developers and we said, how can we make an X3?
[02:56:13.543 --> 02:56:14.324]  And they said, well,
[02:56:14.924 --> 02:56:22.926]  Some people can't absorb pure atomic nascent iodine, but if you add the other two types, it supercharges it and delivers it into the cells better.
[02:56:23.266 --> 02:56:24.206]  So I said, which one's better?
[02:56:24.226 --> 02:56:26.087]  They said it's really apples and oranges.
[02:56:26.127 --> 02:56:27.327]  It depends on the person.
[02:56:27.367 --> 02:56:28.748]  So it's two different formulas.
[02:56:28.788 --> 02:56:29.788]  It's a great seller.
[02:56:30.188 --> 02:56:30.788]  People love it.
[02:56:31.008 --> 02:56:32.749]  I personally like it best.
[02:56:32.789 --> 02:56:33.989]  I get the best results for myself.
[02:56:34.349 --> 02:56:34.589]  I think so.
[02:56:57.990 --> 02:57:03.614]  We are offering X3 at 60% off with free shipping and double Patreon points.
[02:57:03.654 --> 02:57:10.418]  That is the biggest deal we've ever offered in the history of this product because I want you to experience it and we're so proud of it.
[02:57:10.659 --> 02:57:15.462]  All of these things are essential, meaning if you do not have it, your body breaks down and you die.
[02:57:15.542 --> 02:57:15.982]  What a thought.
[02:57:16.002 --> 02:57:17.923]  It takes 3-4 days to die without water.
[02:57:18.104 --> 02:57:20.725]  It takes about a month or so to die without food on average.
[02:57:20.885 --> 02:57:21.806]  But what's in the food?
[02:57:21.926 --> 02:57:25.769]  Well, it's the vitamins, it's the minerals, it's the different elements our body has to have.
[02:57:25.789 --> 02:57:27.490]  And one of the big ones is iodine.
[02:57:27.930 --> 02:57:28.890]  Check this out for yourself.
[02:57:29.050 --> 02:57:39.973]  Even Wikipedia links to UN reports that over 2 billion people on the face of the earth have lower IQs and other cognitive disabilities because of iodine deficiencies.
[02:57:40.453 --> 02:57:42.414]  Wherever you get iodine, get it.
[02:57:42.794 --> 02:57:43.894]  Sea salt has it.
[02:57:44.114 --> 02:57:44.734]  Fish has it.
[02:57:44.794 --> 02:57:50.236]  The problem is it's not strong in sea salt and a lot of the stuff in fish is contaminated with mercury and other things.
[02:57:50.536 --> 02:57:51.376]  This doesn't have any of that.
[02:57:51.596 --> 02:57:52.317]  Totally clean.
[02:57:52.697 --> 02:57:54.600]  It's triiodine, and I want you to have it.
[02:57:54.960 --> 02:57:58.265]  It's 60% off with free shipping, double Patriot points.
[02:57:58.285 --> 02:58:03.592]  Despite the fact we're going to sell out of it, this is our big loss leader, and I want you to experience and see what it does for you.
[02:58:04.193 --> 02:58:08.739]  On average, it took me and my family about two, three weeks for the full effects of it to kick in.
[02:58:09.039 --> 02:58:09.359]  I think so.
[02:58:28.592 --> 02:58:37.074]  We fund ourselves with book sales, t-shirt sales, and supplement sales at InfoWarsTore.com, so please take advantage of the sale today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:58:37.514 --> 02:58:44.136]  X3 Tri-Ionide, the biggest sale in our history, also essential for your immune system.
[02:58:44.516 --> 02:58:46.016]  Look into IQ and Ionide.

[02:58:53.482 --> 02:59:05.227]  InfoWars is very excited to announce that in the last 16 months, we have been very busy developing three new products that are the trifecta of immune support.
[02:59:05.327 --> 02:59:10.289]  A lot of the research is new, but most of the research is actually very old and well documented.
[02:59:10.329 --> 02:59:11.530]  Take just one of the products.
[02:59:11.690 --> 02:59:14.813]  New Info Wars Live, Vitamin C plus Zinc with Rose Hemps.
[02:59:14.913 --> 02:59:15.473]  Now listen to this.
[02:59:15.693 --> 02:59:27.783]  Linus Pauling won a Nobel Prize for science that 1,100% of the daily recommended allowance of Vitamin C did incredible things for the body, for your health, for stamina.
[02:59:28.003 --> 02:59:34.969]  Well, we simply went back to his research and put out the formulation that he recommended with the Zinc and the Rose Hemps.
[02:59:35.049 --> 02:59:39.793]  This is the classic super Vitamin C product from a natural organic source and it's 25% off.
[02:59:40.854 --> 02:59:41.094]  I think so.
[02:59:56.598 --> 02:59:56.898]  I think so.
[03:00:16.890 --> 03:00:23.952]  We have delicious high-quality vitamin D3 gummies with calcium as well 25% off.
[03:00:24.592 --> 03:00:34.955]  I don't have to tell you what vitamin D3 does or what calcium does but the two again go together in a synergistic fashion and all three of these formulas go together in synergistic fashion to do incredible things for your body.
[03:00:35.236 --> 03:00:39.937]  This is something that everyone should be taking but especially those of us above the
