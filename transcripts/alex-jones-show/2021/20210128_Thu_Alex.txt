[00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:03.310]  Anybody who knows him, and I do, knows that he's a fighter.
[00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:04.671]  Knows that he's a brawler.
[00:00:04.751 --> 00:00:06.611]  Knows that he hasn't given up on America.
[00:00:07.151 --> 00:00:08.332]  I'm sure he's disappointed.
[00:00:08.572 --> 00:00:11.733]  I'm sure he's angry about being banned on Twitter.
[00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:15.394]  Means he should have joined other platforms previously.
[00:00:15.995 --> 00:00:19.836]  Putting all your eggs in the Twitter basket turned out to be an enormous mistake.
[00:00:20.456 --> 00:00:22.297]  I can tell him about that first hand.
[00:00:23.277 --> 00:00:25.918]  We are going to need to solve that problem first.
[00:00:26.616 --> 00:00:33.759]  The Trump movement, the America First movement, has no future as long as there is censorship of the internet.
[00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:37.220]  It is the number one issue in the country.
[00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.901]  It was four years ago when you and I raised it.
[00:00:40.221 --> 00:00:42.202]  We have talked about it ad nauseum.
[00:00:42.662 --> 00:00:45.924]  It cost us the election exactly as we predicted it would.
[00:00:46.484 --> 00:00:47.944]  It has to be solved.
[00:00:48.044 --> 00:00:54.327]  And it can only be solved by the formation of new platforms that are not built on sand.
[00:00:54.947 --> 00:01:05.954]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us.
[00:01:07.695 --> 00:01:09.896]  Our Republic is in the process of being taken over.
[00:01:09.916 --> 00:01:12.598]  Our economy is in the process of being artificially shut down.
[00:01:12.618 --> 00:01:15.699]  These are really the times that are going to drive men's souls.
[00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:20.042]  There's also a lot of good news breaking as well.
[00:01:20.062 --> 00:01:21.683]  We're starting to see more and more leadership form.
[00:01:22.683 --> 00:01:28.967]  From very respected levels and very, very good people that we now have to start the civil disobedience.
[00:01:29.928 --> 00:01:42.375]  That's why the globalists are trying to infiltrate all of our patriot organizations and provocateur them into violence so that they can short circuit our legitimate movement to point out that Joe Biden is a communist Chinese agent and is totally illegitimate.
[00:01:42.395 --> 00:01:43.716]  So this is a very, very dangerous time.
[00:01:45.117 --> 00:01:51.501]  The Oath Keepers have had three of their group indicted for going into the Capitol.
[00:01:52.273 --> 00:01:59.656]  And of course they have informants and people claiming that they were training months before some type of capital incursion.
[00:01:59.736 --> 00:02:00.877]  Who knows if any of that's true?
[00:02:01.637 --> 00:02:05.759]  But the point is, is that they are sending infiltrators into every major organization.
[00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:15.082]  I even had people approach me on the street and things and say, you know, Hey Alex, we've got assets outside town.
[00:02:15.102 --> 00:02:15.743]  We're ready to bring them in.
[00:02:15.803 --> 00:02:17.183]  I'm like, no, I don't want to hear about your assets.
[00:02:17.263 --> 00:02:20.825]  And I don't want to hear about any weapons being brought into DC.
[00:02:20.845 --> 00:02:21.105]  This was,
[00:02:22.273 --> 00:02:28.098]  But the first March, and that wasn't Oath Keepers, it was other, it was just guys in camo coming up and saying it, and they just were total feds.
[00:02:28.678 --> 00:02:37.746]  Because the kooky kind of lunatic types that want that, you can tell, you know, they smell, they look crazy, they're schizophrenic, you see some of that.
[00:02:38.466 --> 00:02:42.810]  But you can tell these federal informants and these feds, I mean, these guys have a gravitas to them.
[00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.851]  And they can't hide it.
[00:02:44.091 --> 00:02:44.712]  They just can't hide it.
[00:02:45.232 --> 00:02:46.313]  And they stick out like sore thumbs.
[00:02:47.257 --> 00:02:48.538]  And I just kept warning everybody.
[00:02:48.558 --> 00:02:50.380]  Everybody's like, Jones, quit being a wimp.
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.581]  We're not doing anything wrong.
[00:02:52.001 --> 00:02:52.942]  We're not planning any violence.
[00:02:53.002 --> 00:02:55.244]  I'm like, I know, but this is serious.
[00:02:56.265 --> 00:03:09.557]  And then Roger Stone had the police come to his hotel room and Roger had already left town on the 6th.
[00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:12.960]  They're trying to frame Roger now.
[00:03:13.746 --> 00:03:16.547]  Saying, oh, he must have been commanding the Oath Keepers.
[00:03:16.587 --> 00:03:17.707]  That's what CNN is saying.
[00:03:18.387 --> 00:03:21.728]  That's what Vice and a bunch of others are saying.
[00:03:22.408 --> 00:03:37.312]  And of course, ladies and gentlemen, Rogers is a great guy, but he is 100% not paramilitary and 100% peaceful and 100% not involved in any type of tactical information.
[00:03:37.632 --> 00:03:39.212]  He wears, you know, fancy three-piece suits.
[00:03:39.753 --> 00:03:40.593]  This is just unbelievable.
[00:03:40.613 --> 00:03:41.093]  But to see
[00:03:41.912 --> 00:03:43.973]  How they continue to target him never ends.
[00:03:44.634 --> 00:03:57.462]  In fact, his former co-host, who's a former co-host of War Room with Owen Schroeder, now hosts that show solo, Monday through Friday from 3 to 6 p.m., has had a front row seat to witnessing all of this.
[00:03:57.502 --> 00:04:05.207]  And he'll be co-hosting with me today when Roger Stone exclusively joins us at the bottom of the hour.
[00:04:05.687 --> 00:04:08.729]  And he wants to specifically not even speak to this because he has nothing to do with it.
[00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:11.271]  I've got the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, all
[00:04:14.065 --> 00:04:15.286]  And the answer is, I know nothing.
[00:04:16.667 --> 00:04:18.148]  People say, oh, Jones, you're running scared.
[00:04:18.208 --> 00:04:19.409]  No, I know nothing.
[00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.112]  People also said, oh, Jones, you must be really scared.
[00:04:23.733 --> 00:04:27.195]  You're calling for peace and you're calling for everybody to not be violent.
[00:04:27.996 --> 00:04:29.717]  We need to overthrow this illegitimate government.
[00:04:29.798 --> 00:04:34.041]  And that's mainly informants and online globalists stirring that up and agitating that.
[00:04:34.281 --> 00:04:36.383]  But there are some real people out there that are actually pushing this.
[00:04:36.983 --> 00:04:37.724]  And you're idiots.
[00:04:39.005 --> 00:04:40.266]  I'm not the one crapping bricks.
[00:04:40.865 --> 00:04:45.907]  You're going to be the one crapping bricks if you carry out some type of violent stuff and you give the globalists whatever they want.
[00:04:47.888 --> 00:04:49.869]  I've been crapping bricks for 27 years.
[00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:51.929]  I've been worried about the New World Order for a long time.
[00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:53.430]  I cover real issues here.
[00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:54.390]  This is not a game.
[00:04:54.791 --> 00:04:55.731]  This is not a joke.
[00:04:56.171 --> 00:04:57.031]  This is dangerous.
[00:04:57.932 --> 00:05:08.316]  And the Southern Poverty Law Center and the ADL have massive fleets of informants that have infiltrated almost all the militias and all the major groups so they can lead the resistance into destruction.
[00:05:09.306 --> 00:05:09.927]  It's that simple.
[00:05:09.947 --> 00:05:13.830]  And if I haven't proven I know what I'm talking about yet, then people just don't need to listen to me anymore, okay?
[00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:22.257]  But I refuse to be a moron, and I refuse to be part of this ongoing fiasco that we're witnessing.
[00:05:22.297 --> 00:05:23.558]  Rob, will you do me a favor and give me a tissue?
[00:05:23.578 --> 00:05:24.779]  Thanks.
[00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:27.181]  So, that's what it comes down to.
[00:05:27.702 --> 00:05:28.523]  That's what it comes down to.
[00:05:28.543 --> 00:05:36.830]  And I'm going to try to just reset my thoughts here and come back and lay out all the big news because we need to be covering the Great Reset, the cutting off of our power supplies,
[00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:46.576]  The people dying from the inoculations and not let them get us off balance and be constantly, you know, Oh, Oath Keepers or Oh, now we're over here with the Boogaloo Boys.
[00:05:46.637 --> 00:05:48.618]  And now we're over here with the Proud Boys.
[00:05:49.119 --> 00:05:55.184]  All of which are decent organizations and their ideals, but are fertile grounds for setups.
[00:05:55.724 --> 00:05:56.625]  One last breath.
[00:05:58.626 --> 00:06:00.068]  Better raise your ears.
[00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.232]  Lock up your wife and children now.
[00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:09.699]  Because now you've got some company.
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.920]  The horsemen are drawing nearer.
[00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:16.920]  They're coming.
[00:06:18.001 --> 00:06:24.082]  With GMO food, 5G, deadly mRNA, gene therapy injections.
[00:06:25.162 --> 00:06:26.662]  They are coming to take your life.
[00:06:28.182 --> 00:06:29.923]  This is a 21st century war.
[00:06:29.943 --> 00:06:32.483]  You've got to know how to beat a 21st century war.
[00:06:32.843 --> 00:06:37.044]  With civil disobedience, with information, with truth, and with justice.
[00:06:38.646 --> 00:06:43.328]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Thursday, 28th day of January, 2021.
[00:06:44.209 --> 00:06:49.991]  I am my last day here now coming back from Utah.
[00:06:50.432 --> 00:06:51.472]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[00:06:51.552 --> 00:06:56.935]  Owen Schroer is doing an excellent job back at the ATX News Center.
[00:06:58.696 --> 00:07:01.597]  And for me, let me just lay out what I think is biggest and first and foremost.
[00:07:03.132 --> 00:07:11.034]  Trump, if he gets off the defense, could be the president of the world, as Chris Ruddy of Newsmax said in a very important interview that's gone viral last night.
[00:07:11.655 --> 00:07:14.395]  We should grab that Chris Ruddy interview.
[00:07:14.435 --> 00:07:15.156]  It's on Newsmax.
[00:07:15.176 --> 00:07:17.796]  It's got about a million views as of this morning when I watched it at 5 a.m.
[00:07:19.637 --> 00:07:21.577]  And he says Trump can now be president of the world.
[00:07:21.617 --> 00:07:22.998]  That's actually a true statement.
[00:07:23.698 --> 00:07:27.999]  He has that level of leadership and that level of popularity if he'll just do it and grab the bull by the horns.
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.340]  If he charges in,
[00:07:31.517 --> 00:07:36.861]  And demands to be in that Senate trial and demands weeks to put on his defense, he will annihilate them.
[00:07:37.882 --> 00:07:41.465]  The problem is the lawyers are all so cowardly, they all get backroom deals to sell out the President.
[00:07:41.885 --> 00:07:43.146]  Believe me, I've been through it myself.
[00:07:43.886 --> 00:07:46.568]  And the dirty tricks the Globalists pull are just unbelievable.
[00:07:46.609 --> 00:07:48.310]  You can't imagine what the President's gone through.
[00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:51.192]  I've gotten a small, hellish taste of it.
[00:07:51.672 --> 00:07:59.018]  We're talking full CIA, full law firms, full FBI, full Southern District New York, full, full deal, okay?
[00:07:59.864 --> 00:08:01.605]  And that's anybody that supported the president.
[00:08:01.625 --> 00:08:03.707]  So everybody's like, oh, the president could have done this or could have done that.
[00:08:03.907 --> 00:08:04.307]  Yeah, right.
[00:08:06.208 --> 00:08:08.210]  Yeah, where he stumbled and failed was not being more hardcore.
[00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:08.590]  It's true.
[00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:14.854]  But Roger Stone's going to join us to talk about the trial that kicks off on February 8th.
[00:08:14.894 --> 00:08:23.239]  But you already noticed that Mitch McConnell and others are starting to creep away from it a little bit, saying, well, maybe we don't have the votes for this or, you know, maybe we shouldn't do it.
[00:08:23.259 --> 00:08:26.922]  But oh, well, they desperately want to not let him run again.
[00:08:27.577 --> 00:08:28.818]  For the Senate or for Governor.
[00:08:29.258 --> 00:08:32.020]  They desperately don't want that because they know he's very popular.
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:32.900]  They know he won the election.
[00:08:33.341 --> 00:08:34.781]  They have all these fake polls, folks.
[00:08:35.902 --> 00:08:37.643]  Saying, oh, everyone loves the lockdown.
[00:08:38.064 --> 00:08:39.945]  Real internal polls, 10% like it.
[00:08:40.425 --> 00:08:41.105]  Same thing in the UK.
[00:08:41.245 --> 00:08:42.706]  Oh, 75% like lockdowns.
[00:08:42.987 --> 00:08:44.708]  They do internal polls, 15% like it.
[00:08:45.188 --> 00:08:52.953]  And they now know with the tracking apps that are already on the phones, they're just now telling you about it, that upwards of 79% of people in the UK don't follow the rules.
[00:08:53.933 --> 00:08:54.814]  Because they know it's crap.
[00:08:55.416 --> 00:08:56.357]  So they use these polls.
[00:08:56.417 --> 00:08:58.018]  Oh, everybody loves pedophilia.
[00:08:58.438 --> 00:09:00.199]  Everybody loves men and women's sports.
[00:09:00.679 --> 00:09:01.940]  Everybody loves open borders.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.021]  Everybody loves cancer.
[00:09:03.501 --> 00:09:05.102]  Everybody loves being bankrupt.
[00:09:05.142 --> 00:09:06.223]  Everybody loves being poor.
[00:09:06.583 --> 00:09:07.643]  Everybody loves Joe Biden.
[00:09:10.405 --> 00:09:21.512]  I'm told by sources close to Biden that he has to read a teleprompter speech up to five times before he can give one that's half decent, like he gave that very short, shortest really ever inaugural speech I've heard of.
[00:09:21.532 --> 00:09:23.693]  I mean, Trump's was over an hour long.
[00:09:23.753 --> 00:09:24.934]  Biden's was less than 10 minutes.
[00:09:25.819 --> 00:09:27.499]  And that's because he had to rehearse that at least five times.
[00:09:27.999 --> 00:09:31.660]  When he's not rehearsed, folks, he doesn't know what planet he is on.
[00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:41.602]  We've got at least three gaffes that I sent the crew this morning, where he's talking about, we got 300 Americans, we're gonna give them all, you know, 20 million shots, and he keeps repeating it.
[00:09:41.902 --> 00:09:42.822]  It's not edited video.
[00:09:43.142 --> 00:09:45.983]  He doesn't know what planet he's on.
[00:09:46.423 --> 00:09:51.524]  So we've got all of that, and if we just don't let them use this Capitol event,
[00:09:52.267 --> 00:09:54.128]  But they clearly infiltrated Patriot groups.
[00:09:54.248 --> 00:09:55.768]  They used Antifa to lead the chants.
[00:09:56.749 --> 00:09:59.750]  They got two or three people from each large Patriot group.
[00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:03.211]  Boogaloo's quasi-Patriot.
[00:10:03.691 --> 00:10:06.953]  There's some good people in there, but I think overall it's being controlled.
[00:10:06.973 --> 00:10:10.174]  The Oath Keepers have been a great organization.
[00:10:10.214 --> 00:10:12.675]  They've really stood up against infiltration and being set up.
[00:10:12.695 --> 00:10:14.856]  They've done a great job, led by Stuart Rhodes.
[00:10:14.976 --> 00:10:18.077]  And then, of course, you've got the Proud Boys that
[00:10:19.636 --> 00:10:22.757]  I think you're good people overall, but it's perfect to be set up and infiltrated.
[00:10:23.117 --> 00:10:24.177]  And I've reviewed all the footage.
[00:10:24.797 --> 00:10:31.858]  There were Boogaloos, there were Proud Boys, and there were three Oath Keepers out of an organization of tens of thousands.
[00:10:31.898 --> 00:10:34.979]  It's true, though, that that did lead the break into the Capitol.
[00:10:35.239 --> 00:10:47.181]  And I've spent hours again last night and this morning, and now that it's all codified, now that it's all come out, I actually got tears in my eyes this morning having to watch a Wall Street Journal report that shows the three Proud Boys being instrumental in breaking into the Capitol.
[00:10:48.115 --> 00:10:50.036]  And they can say, oh, we showed them and all this stuff.
[00:10:51.117 --> 00:10:51.917]  They're not all fed.
[00:10:51.977 --> 00:10:54.619]  Some of them are just useful idiots that got caught up in the mob psychology.
[00:10:54.639 --> 00:11:01.723]  But we're not gonna be like the media and lie about things and just say it was all provocateur, it was all staged.
[00:11:02.463 --> 00:11:05.565]  If some of it was people being foolish, being sucked in, I'll be honest.
[00:11:05.585 --> 00:11:06.965]  But is it the new Pearl Harbor?
[00:11:07.045 --> 00:11:08.286]  No, it's not one one millionth of it.
[00:11:08.826 --> 00:11:11.388]  Four citizens got killed and a cop had a heart attack later and died.
[00:11:11.648 --> 00:11:12.328]  We're sad for him.
[00:11:12.368 --> 00:11:15.130]  But everybody says, Jones, move on from the Capitol.
[00:11:16.658 --> 00:11:19.879]  They're going to use that to pass this anti-terrorism bill against the American people.
[00:11:19.939 --> 00:11:21.980]  They're going to use that to come after everybody.
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:27.543]  They're using the terms in the bill about interdicting and disrupting the networks of Trump.
[00:11:27.703 --> 00:11:30.124]  They're trying to make being a Trump supporter illegal.
[00:11:30.364 --> 00:11:31.284]  Roughly half the country.
[00:11:31.765 --> 00:11:32.025]  Okay?
[00:11:33.365 --> 00:11:34.286]  Way more than half the voters.
[00:11:34.906 --> 00:11:36.026]  This is insane.
[00:11:36.907 --> 00:11:40.348]  And so I would invite you to understand that yes, we have an illegitimate government.
[00:11:40.388 --> 00:11:41.569]  Yes, it does horrible, corrupt things.
[00:11:42.307 --> 00:11:50.131]  But the way they're psyoping this is they want a physical confrontation because they know they stole this election and it's unpopular and it's going to backfire on them massively.
[00:11:51.112 --> 00:11:53.893]  And so the globalists are already starting to eat their own.
[00:11:54.473 --> 00:11:58.935]  They brought back all these skeletons like John Kerry to turn off our economy and the rest of it.
[00:11:59.316 --> 00:12:00.776]  This is not going to go well for them.
[00:12:01.437 --> 00:12:05.799]  So they're betting on armed conflict in this country and they're intending to trigger it.
[00:12:06.869 --> 00:12:09.852]  I'm so proud of Patriots when I put out the alarm and others did after the 6th.
[00:12:10.213 --> 00:12:11.474]  Do not go to these armed marches.
[00:12:11.755 --> 00:12:12.936]  Like, what are you against armed marches?
[00:12:12.976 --> 00:12:15.539]  No, I'm all for open carry for the Second Amendment.
[00:12:15.859 --> 00:12:20.124]  But not when they want us and not when they say everybody's going to the Capitals on the 20th.
[00:12:21.365 --> 00:12:25.951]  Part of that so-called Q-storm that was meant to not just have everybody embarrassed on the 20th,
[00:12:27.944 --> 00:12:41.148]  When he was actually inaugurated fraudulently, but then to have sporadic pipe bombs, attacks around the country by the feds, by the Southern Poverty Law Center, by the ADL control groups, to then demonize all of us and get the anti-terrorism bill passed.
[00:12:41.508 --> 00:12:46.069]  And then we're going to be inside the real shooting war all you so-called, you know, tough guys want to get into.
[00:12:46.109 --> 00:12:47.409]  So I love the audience.
[00:12:47.449 --> 00:12:48.069]  I love everybody.
[00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:52.391]  I understand Americans at a very primitive level have a right to revolt.
[00:12:52.411 --> 00:12:53.651]  It's in the Declaration of Independence.
[00:12:54.472 --> 00:12:58.613]  We've gone way past the point of when it's legitimate to, you know, have conflict.
[00:12:58.693 --> 00:12:59.433]  But here's the deal.
[00:12:59.893 --> 00:13:00.834]  That's the old war.
[00:13:02.154 --> 00:13:05.555]  The new war is psychological, it's chemical, it's electronic.
[00:13:05.895 --> 00:13:13.857]  And you've got to get people aware of the globalist and the outside takeover and how an outside force is destroying the country and how China is at the heart of it with the EU.
[00:13:14.297 --> 00:13:19.178]  And if you have that mass awakening and then get governors and senators, notice who are they targeting?
[00:13:19.218 --> 00:13:22.599]  Josh Hawley, Cruz, Rand Paul,
[00:13:23.813 --> 00:13:27.235]  Some members of Congress, myself, and a few governors that are good.
[00:13:28.596 --> 00:13:49.586]  And that's because they know that if a coalition forms around that and legitimate media like OAN, InfoWars, Newsmax, and others that will form a legal lawful coalition and we will not comply with these globalist operations and the states are going to pass laws, they already are, that you can't just mail out fake ballots and all that stuff they did outside of law last year.
[00:13:50.346 --> 00:13:51.347]  And we're going to reverse this.
[00:13:52.955 --> 00:13:59.359]  And you're going to see a massive landslide in a year and 11 months, or a year and 10 months now.
[00:13:59.519 --> 00:14:03.082]  You're going to see a massive realignment, realignment.
[00:14:03.122 --> 00:14:07.464]  We already had a global realignment against the neural border, against corporate fascism and all this garbage.
[00:14:07.504 --> 00:14:13.448]  But they've come down with both feet on us now and have activated the CIA already domestically against us.
[00:14:13.668 --> 00:14:15.730]  And now they got a bill to do it out in the open.
[00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:20.753]  And I know the real people that actually pull the triggers in the CIA.
[00:14:20.773 --> 00:14:21.713]  And I can tell you, they're pissed.
[00:14:21.733 --> 00:14:22.554]  They're not going along with it.
[00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:35.098]  But you've got the academics up on the top, the John Brennan types and the White House press secretary, Sushi, up there craze-eyed saying, we're coming with physical force for you.
[00:14:35.779 --> 00:14:39.801]  And so they really intend to actually turn the CIA loose on the American people.
[00:14:40.422 --> 00:14:43.324]  And so this is rapidly deteriorating very, very quickly.
[00:14:44.051 --> 00:14:47.454]  And I just want to tell the CIA, the FBI, everybody, this needs to stop.
[00:14:47.554 --> 00:14:48.414]  This is insane.
[00:14:48.895 --> 00:14:50.136]  You talk about a dictatorship.
[00:14:50.536 --> 00:14:51.837]  This is everything they said Trump was going to do.
[00:14:51.857 --> 00:14:53.658]  He never even got one one millionth towards it.
[00:14:53.898 --> 00:14:54.839]  But see, that's the cue.
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:07.729]  Trust the plan, Operation Trust is everything that patriots magically believe that Trump was going to do and all this great authoritarianism that wasn't going to be great is actually turned around and put on us.
[00:15:08.502 --> 00:15:12.165]  So everything that you were told, reverse it, and it's the opposite.
[00:15:12.185 --> 00:15:14.906]  That's why the Q leader said, go home, it's over, none of this was real.
[00:15:15.467 --> 00:15:21.491]  Well, the child molesting, the world government, the cloning, the GMO, the deadly vaccines, all of it, the Great Reset, that's all real?
[00:15:22.131 --> 00:15:26.915]  It was just the fake dates, and the mass arrest, and the underground bases with millions of kids.
[00:15:26.935 --> 00:15:27.775]  That was all crap.
[00:15:28.216 --> 00:15:28.796]  You're listening.
[00:15:30.322 --> 00:15:32.403]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:15:32.523 --> 00:15:35.623]  I am your host, Alex Jones, coming to you from on the ground in Utah.
[00:15:35.963 --> 00:15:37.724]  Owen Schroer is back in the APX.
[00:15:38.284 --> 00:15:41.245]  I want to go to Owen here right before Roger Stone joins us.
[00:15:42.185 --> 00:15:52.668]  Owen, I really want to try to balance this out and not be on defense while the media demonizes us and tries to claim that we're violent and tries to claim that we wanted to attack the Capitol.
[00:15:52.708 --> 00:15:57.849]  But that's where they're going with this because they want to basically outlaw opposition.
[00:15:58.616 --> 00:15:58.856]  I think?
[00:16:14.998 --> 00:16:21.620]  Soros-funded AG of New York admits that, okay, they covered up the nursing home deaths.
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:28.681]  It was 12 plus thousand, not 6,000 like they said, but she says that's just fine that we killed these people and we covered it up.
[00:16:29.181 --> 00:16:36.303]  New York AG says the Cuomo administration understood and undercounted COVID nursing home deaths by 50%, meaning the real number.
[00:16:38.063 --> 00:16:39.264]  Yes, put that back up on screen for me.
[00:16:39.284 --> 00:16:39.584]  Thank you.
[00:16:40.164 --> 00:16:41.224]  I was reading that off the TV screen.
[00:16:41.264 --> 00:16:41.564]  Thank you.
[00:16:41.964 --> 00:16:44.345]  New York AG says the Cuomo administration
[00:16:46.494 --> 00:16:53.598]  Undercounted COVID nursing home deaths by 50%, meaning the real number is more than 12,000, but says there's no proof.
[00:16:54.338 --> 00:17:00.621]  His decision to send 6,326 infected patients back into the facilities caused more deaths.
[00:17:00.782 --> 00:17:10.366]  Again, this virus, as all the researchers have said, only kills you if you're not getting sunlight and don't have vitamin D3, zinc, and vitamin C. Well, what's happening in these nursing homes?
[00:17:10.387 --> 00:17:11.467]  They feed them terrible food.
[00:17:11.487 --> 00:17:12.247]  They're never outside.
[00:17:12.287 --> 00:17:12.728]  They don't have D3.
[00:17:14.365 --> 00:17:25.112]  It's double the number of blacks that die because they need even more vitamin D3, because a little bit of sun they do get is basically absorbed, bounces off, because they have more melanin in their skin.
[00:17:25.632 --> 00:17:30.815]  In fact, a lot of studies show black folks need triple the supplementation that, say, a fair-skinned person needs.
[00:17:31.476 --> 00:17:38.480]  And literally, I've talked about that on air and seen articles saying, is Alex Jones racist, telling black people to take vitamin D?
[00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:41.862]  I mean, you've got this group with GameStop
[00:17:42.797 --> 00:17:45.379]  Off Reddit saying, hey, look, they did shorts on this.
[00:17:45.419 --> 00:17:46.620]  Let's make our own money on this.
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:49.942]  And because private citizens did it, the news is calling that racist.
[00:17:50.023 --> 00:17:53.585]  I mean, if you try to give somebody water in the desert, they'd call it racist.
[00:17:53.605 --> 00:17:55.627]  This is that they just inject that into everything.
[00:17:55.807 --> 00:17:57.468]  But now it's terrorists, terrorists.
[00:17:57.668 --> 00:18:00.550]  Although they're terrorists, you know, they can't have a radio show.
[00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:01.531]  They can't have a website.
[00:18:01.771 --> 00:18:03.032]  They can't have an email server.
[00:18:03.933 --> 00:18:09.217]  All of this is going on constantly as they silence parlors, they silence these groups saying, oh,
[00:18:10.774 --> 00:18:15.296]  We can't let anybody have a voice because somebody might organize and do something violent.
[00:18:15.376 --> 00:18:19.418]  And most of it is feds and Southern Poverty Law Center people on these groups trying to organize it.
[00:18:19.918 --> 00:18:22.939]  And then I use rhetoric like, if you want to fight, you better believe you got one.
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:29.182]  Politically, intellectually, the Democrats say, you know, when they go low, we kick them.
[00:18:29.642 --> 00:18:34.664]  Go to their houses, get in their faces, burn down their neighborhoods, harass them, break Rand Paul's ribs.
[00:18:34.684 --> 00:18:35.285]  He deserved it.
[00:18:35.365 --> 00:18:36.265]  Scalise deserved it.
[00:18:36.565 --> 00:18:38.406]  Their rhetoric is 50 times ours.
[00:18:40.224 --> 00:18:42.525]  Oh my gosh, is Jones going to get indicted?
[00:18:42.765 --> 00:18:47.407]  Because the night before the sixth event, he said, if you want to fight, you better believe you got one.
[00:18:47.587 --> 00:18:48.747]  That's like singing a baseball game.
[00:18:48.928 --> 00:18:50.968]  We're going to give him a fight at halftime.
[00:18:52.009 --> 00:18:52.249]  Fight!
[00:18:52.429 --> 00:18:52.649]  Fight!
[00:18:52.809 --> 00:18:53.029]  Fight!
[00:18:53.349 --> 00:18:55.210]  How about they start indicting the drill teams?
[00:18:55.797 --> 00:19:00.759]  In high school, the cheerleaders, when the band's up there, fight, fight, fight, fight!
[00:19:00.879 --> 00:19:01.720]  Just arrest them all!
[00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:02.880]  But see, that's the left.
[00:19:03.101 --> 00:19:04.581]  We can say, burn your building down.
[00:19:04.601 --> 00:19:05.662]  We can say, kill cops.
[00:19:05.922 --> 00:19:07.883]  Bang, bang, you know, oink, oink, you're dead.
[00:19:08.243 --> 00:19:15.526]  They can do all that real stuff, Owen, but then we legitimately have always been about peacefully fixing things.
[00:19:15.566 --> 00:19:18.728]  Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King, and of course they learned from Jesus Christ.
[00:19:19.532 --> 00:19:21.313]  And that's where our power is.
[00:19:21.413 --> 00:19:22.653]  That's what we stand for.
[00:19:22.693 --> 00:19:32.177]  But they, the violent left that run the death camps in China, the Apple computers that run the death camps in China, they're the good guys because they say that we're racist and evil and need to be arrested.
[00:19:32.537 --> 00:19:33.757]  So there you go, Owen.
[00:19:33.877 --> 00:19:35.298]  What the hell is going on here?
[00:19:36.049 --> 00:19:37.751]  Well, let me just say this, Alex.
[00:19:38.051 --> 00:19:44.777]  I believe that the next month or so, the ground is ripe for unity.
[00:19:44.917 --> 00:19:47.819]  And I think the GameStop story is a perfect example of that.
[00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:50.442]  You know, nobody likes Biden and Harris.
[00:19:50.482 --> 00:19:52.524]  I mean, there's literally no popularity for them at all.
[00:19:53.144 --> 00:19:55.505]  And Democrat Party policy is now being exposed.
[00:19:55.845 --> 00:20:02.668]  And the problem is the media and just the average lunkhead that follows the media and thinks they're politically informed can't blame Trump anymore.
[00:20:03.148 --> 00:20:05.889]  So that whole notion of everything's Trump's fault is kind of gone.
[00:20:06.189 --> 00:20:17.194]  So there's this new kind of new open area for people to kind of unite and forget about Trump for a second and just focus on the real corruption, not being able to blame Trump and move on from that.
[00:20:17.494 --> 00:20:19.275]  But Alex, I think I've got a whole list.
[00:20:19.975 --> 00:20:32.007]  Here of all the fake things that we're dealing with and I can go down that list but Alex here's why I think here's the story about GameStop that I think is so important for people to understand about the liberal media and the Democrat Party.
[00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:39.054]  Why would they be coming out against citizens pushing back against billionaire hedge funds?
[00:20:39.354 --> 00:20:51.661]  Why would they be so against that with people at Mother Jones being against it, New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, the Democrats, of course Biden's people, 30 of the top Wall Street executives funded Biden's campaign in 2016.
[00:20:51.741 --> 00:20:53.202]  I've got that story here as well.
[00:20:53.582 --> 00:20:54.603]  But here's what it is, Alex.
[00:20:55.851 --> 00:20:57.732]  That would just be right up the Democrat Party aisle.
[00:20:57.772 --> 00:20:59.154]  They did Occupy Wall Street.
[00:20:59.174 --> 00:21:00.775]  They're against, oh, the big guy.
[00:21:00.795 --> 00:21:02.276]  They want to tax the rich, all this stuff.
[00:21:02.296 --> 00:21:05.398]  But now that it's actually happening, now that people are pushing back, all of a sudden they're against it.
[00:21:05.418 --> 00:21:06.119]  Well, why is that?
[00:21:06.519 --> 00:21:14.325]  Well, they know it's not their movement because anything organic, any organic movement in America, they know is not theirs.
[00:21:14.906 --> 00:21:16.947]  Every movement they've ever had is synthetic.
[00:21:17.367 --> 00:21:21.491]  Whether it's Occupy Wall Street or whether it's, you know, whatever it is, it's always synthetic.
[00:21:21.531 --> 00:21:22.171]  Black Lives Matter.
[00:21:22.311 --> 00:21:22.692]  Exactly.
[00:21:22.752 --> 00:21:23.352]  Antifa.
[00:21:23.592 --> 00:21:24.453]  And since you mentioned that,
[00:21:25.444 --> 00:21:34.388]  This was citizens coming together and ganging up on the stock and then driving it up and doing the things they did because they saw Wall Street shorting it.
[00:21:35.048 --> 00:21:37.129]  And so, oh, they're not allowed to make money themselves.
[00:21:37.169 --> 00:21:38.129]  That's what all the big guys do.
[00:21:38.149 --> 00:21:39.370]  So now federal
[00:21:40.166 --> 00:21:43.709]  Law enforcement and the Securities and Exchange Commission got involved.
[00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:48.174]  GameStop stock retreats as Reddit Rally runs into trading restrictions.
[00:21:48.654 --> 00:22:00.045]  Reuters GameStop shares sank early on Thursday as trading platforms including Robinhood Interactive Brokers restricted trading in the video game retailer along with AMC Entertainment and other stocks
[00:22:00.365 --> 00:22:05.087]  That soared this week in social media-driven trending frenzy that shook stock markets.
[00:22:05.127 --> 00:22:08.869]  So, exactly, when grassroots do something, it's bad, it's dirty, it's evil.
[00:22:09.089 --> 00:22:18.413]  They've got all these famous people that short stocks and manipulate things and destroy brick-and-mortar stores saying, this is evil, this is bad, this is like a form of terrorism, oh, it's racist.
[00:22:18.693 --> 00:22:21.514]  What the hell does this have to do with terrorism or racism?
[00:22:22.219 --> 00:22:26.222]  And even the Capitol is a perfect example, Alex, because nobody was in control of that.
[00:22:26.262 --> 00:22:29.203]  Like you said, they're calling you, they're calling me, what was the plan?
[00:22:29.223 --> 00:22:31.585]  And I'm like, there was no plan!
[00:22:31.885 --> 00:22:33.126]  I'm sitting at Trump's speech!
[00:22:33.426 --> 00:22:38.069]  Like, I'm sitting there listening, like I'm concocting something, like some man behind a board, like, oh, we're moving.
[00:22:38.349 --> 00:22:39.030]  It's organic.
[00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:40.250]  So that's what they hate, Alex.
[00:22:40.291 --> 00:22:41.571]  They hate organic things.
[00:22:41.611 --> 00:22:42.972]  They hate things that are grassroots.
[00:22:43.012 --> 00:22:44.113]  They hate things that are natural.
[00:22:44.133 --> 00:22:45.294]  So you just hit the key.
[00:22:45.374 --> 00:22:47.035]  That's because they scheme all day.
[00:22:47.395 --> 00:22:48.376]  They think we're like them.
[00:22:49.335 --> 00:22:58.342]  And so that's why they see this thing happening with GameStop stock and the AMC and everything, because they see it and they're like, whoa, this is actually pushing back against the establishment.
[00:22:58.523 --> 00:23:00.764]  And then they're asking each other, are you doing this?
[00:23:00.965 --> 00:23:01.585]  Are you leading this?
[00:23:01.665 --> 00:23:02.125]  And they're like, no.
[00:23:02.145 --> 00:23:03.867]  And they're like, oh my gosh, this is organic.
[00:23:03.887 --> 00:23:04.668]  This is a grassroots thing.
[00:23:04.848 --> 00:23:05.428]  We're against it.
[00:23:05.608 --> 00:23:06.289]  We're against it now.
[00:23:06.529 --> 00:23:07.410]  CNN's against it.
[00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:08.511]  Mainstream News is against it.
[00:23:08.571 --> 00:23:09.571]  Mother Jones is against it.
[00:23:09.652 --> 00:23:10.712]  All of them coming out against it.
[00:23:10.953 --> 00:23:11.953]  Now they even stopped them?
[00:23:12.754 --> 00:23:18.575]  They're saying that these hedge funds, Alex, lost over $13 billion.
[00:23:19.255 --> 00:23:20.976]  That means they would have made $13 billion.
[00:23:21.596 --> 00:23:24.797]  But now, all of a sudden, we're standing up for the Wall Street billionaires?
[00:23:25.237 --> 00:23:30.478]  Now, all of a sudden, the little guy pushing back against the big corruption in Wall Street's a bad thing?
[00:23:30.658 --> 00:23:32.618]  Well, it's only bad because they're not in control of it.
[00:23:32.638 --> 00:23:34.339]  They loved Occupy Wall Street.
[00:23:34.619 --> 00:23:35.199]  Oh, they loved it.
[00:23:35.239 --> 00:23:35.799]  What did that do?
[00:23:36.019 --> 00:23:36.459]  Nothing!
[00:23:36.699 --> 00:23:38.460]  It literally accomplished nothing!
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:40.300]  But here's an organic grassroots thing.
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:43.682]  Beating the big Wall Street guys, and they say, no, you can't do that.
[00:23:45.043 --> 00:23:45.524]  Absolutely.
[00:23:45.564 --> 00:23:46.004]  Stay there.
[00:23:46.104 --> 00:23:49.667]  Your former co-host Roger Stone's about to join us exclusively.
[00:23:49.687 --> 00:23:52.029]  The former co-host of The War Room aired 3 to 6 p.m.
[00:23:52.069 --> 00:23:55.231]  weekdays with Owen Schroyer, who was doing a great job co-hosting with me.
[00:23:55.271 --> 00:23:57.253]  And we've got so much more today coming up.
[00:23:57.293 --> 00:24:01.556]  And by the way, Owen was right yesterday when I was going after the Boogaloo's a little too hard, saying we need Unity.
[00:24:02.097 --> 00:24:04.879]  And in hindsight, that guy might not be a fad.
[00:24:04.899 --> 00:24:05.940]  He might actually mean well.
[00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:06.720]  We'll be right back.
[00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:07.101]  Stay with us.
[00:24:07.841 --> 00:24:08.962]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:17.486]  Thank you so much for joining us on this historic January 28th, 2021 transmission.
[00:24:18.187 --> 00:24:19.628]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:24:20.129 --> 00:24:24.112]  On the road, Owen Schroyer, riding shotgun in our studios in Austin, Texas.
[00:24:24.132 --> 00:24:26.614]  He hosts the War Room 3 to 6 p.m.
[00:24:26.994 --> 00:24:29.616]  weeknights here on the InfoWars Radio TV Network.
[00:24:30.116 --> 00:24:36.842]  And his former co-host and former political prisoner, pardoned by the president, again, for a crime he did not
[00:24:37.734 --> 00:24:39.937]  Commit is Roger Stone.
[00:24:39.997 --> 00:24:47.708]  And now his old friend of 40 plus years, the man he convinced to run for president, is in the place Roger was last year.
[00:24:47.988 --> 00:24:50.311]  He's facing trial in the Senate.
[00:24:50.832 --> 00:24:52.815]  It begins on
[00:24:54.364 --> 00:24:55.384]  February 8th.
[00:24:55.505 --> 00:24:58.126]  And so we're going to be laying all of this out.
[00:24:58.206 --> 00:25:01.067]  Roger has been silent the last few weeks while he's been thinking.
[00:25:01.607 --> 00:25:04.048]  He said, I'll come on your show and have something extremely substantive to say.
[00:25:04.328 --> 00:25:11.231]  He wants to talk about President Trump, talk about this trial coming up and what he thinks the president and others should do.
[00:25:11.291 --> 00:25:12.692]  So Roger, great to have you here with us.
[00:25:12.712 --> 00:25:13.012]  Thank you.
[00:25:14.332 --> 00:25:15.933]  Alex, it's great to be back with you.
[00:25:16.033 --> 00:25:17.954]  And Owen, it's always great to be with you.
[00:25:17.974 --> 00:25:20.295]  You know, I've seen this movie.
[00:25:21.171 --> 00:25:40.761]  What the left in this country did after the impeachment of President Richard Nixon was to systematically erase all of his great accomplishments, whether it was a Soviet, a strategic arms limitation with the Soviets, or whether it was opening the door to China in order to play them off against the Russians.
[00:25:41.241 --> 00:25:43.162]  Dissegregating the public schools.
[00:25:43.903 --> 00:25:47.465]  Saving Israel unilaterally in the Yom Kippur War.
[00:25:48.605 --> 00:25:51.047]  An extraordinary record of accomplishment.
[00:25:51.507 --> 00:25:58.691]  Now what they hope to do to President Trump is impeach him so that they can bury an extraordinary record.
[00:25:59.151 --> 00:26:03.856]  The most robust, fastest growing economy in our history.
[00:26:04.236 --> 00:26:05.857]  The rebuilding of our military.
[00:26:06.158 --> 00:26:10.081]  The appointment of solid conservatives to all levels of the judiciary.
[00:26:10.101 --> 00:26:11.963]  You can go on and on.
[00:26:12.023 --> 00:26:17.228]  Redoing these trade deals that were so one-sided and costing this country jobs.
[00:26:18.369 --> 00:26:29.659]  Pulling us out of the ridiculous Paris Climate Accords where we would pay $365 million and the Chinese, the worst polluters on the globe, would pay not a dime.
[00:26:30.119 --> 00:26:32.681]  They want to erase this record in one word.
[00:26:33.142 --> 00:26:33.762]  Impeachment.
[00:26:34.102 --> 00:26:34.523]  Nixon?
[00:26:34.783 --> 00:26:35.364]  Impeachment.
[00:26:35.644 --> 00:26:35.964]  Trump?
[00:26:36.264 --> 00:26:36.825]  Impeachment.
[00:26:37.285 --> 00:26:42.028]  It's not right, and it's not fair, and we know that history is written by the left.
[00:26:42.368 --> 00:26:45.209]  The historians are leftists.
[00:26:45.609 --> 00:26:50.772]  Some authors, like Rick Perlstein, pose as historians.
[00:26:50.812 --> 00:26:53.133]  They're not historians, they're propagandists.
[00:26:53.613 --> 00:26:54.774]  We can't let this happen.
[00:26:54.814 --> 00:27:00.537]  You see, I think this last final battle for the president is crucial for his legacy.
[00:27:01.149 --> 00:27:07.693]  The other reason the Democrats are so frantic to impeach him is to ensure that he cannot run again.
[00:27:08.374 --> 00:27:11.736]  They fear the power of Donald Trump at the polls.
[00:27:12.216 --> 00:27:22.183]  They know that he touches the American people, that he reaches the American people in a way that no one else has ever been able to do, and therefore they fear a comeback.
[00:27:22.903 --> 00:27:26.626]  This is going to be an extraordinarily important fight in the Senate.
[00:27:28.689 --> 00:27:32.655]  Well, you certainly laid that out with expert analysis.
[00:27:32.835 --> 00:27:33.997]  Let's expand on that.
[00:27:34.278 --> 00:27:38.744]  Instead of running away from this trial, I think Trump should demand all of his time.
[00:27:38.865 --> 00:27:40.107]  I believe he should testify.
[00:27:40.127 --> 00:27:43.472]  I believe he should have lawyers come in and play clips.
[00:27:44.449 --> 00:28:03.500]  Hundreds of them, of Democrats calling for physical violence, Pelosi defending it, Chuck Schumer saying we're going to destroy the Republicans in a whirlwind, we're going to annihilate him, Phil Mudd saying we're going to kill the President on CNN, Wolf Blitzer agreeing with a guest, the guy that shot Congressman Scalise was a hero, he nods when the guy says it.
[00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:06.121]  I mean, I can give all this to the President, you can give it to him.
[00:28:07.102 --> 00:28:12.485]  Show all that, and then show himself during the speech and his son before him on the 6th
[00:28:13.772 --> 00:28:21.360]  When the violence already started before he even started speaking, saying, let's be nonviolent, which Trump groups are always nonviolent.
[00:28:22.141 --> 00:28:23.823]  And so yes, did some people get out of hand?
[00:28:23.983 --> 00:28:29.569]  Did a very small minority of groups that wanted to fight go there before Trump even spoke and start attacking the police?
[00:28:29.609 --> 00:28:29.769]  Yes.
[00:28:30.664 --> 00:28:33.186]  And I know that's a separate issue, but that's going to be the trial.
[00:28:33.606 --> 00:28:38.869]  And I think Trump needs to go in there swinging and saying, I'm the guy that's pro-law and order.
[00:28:39.229 --> 00:28:42.311]  I'm the guy that was trying to expose this election fraud.
[00:28:42.351 --> 00:28:46.634]  And he can use that as a place to put on the evidence of election fraud as well.
[00:28:46.654 --> 00:28:48.134]  They're not going to be able to tell him to shut up.
[00:28:48.535 --> 00:28:49.755]  This would be spectacular.
[00:28:49.775 --> 00:28:52.157]  This would be the ultimate reality TV show.
[00:28:52.797 --> 00:28:55.539]  And according to many scholars, he could get up to two months
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:29:02.229]  Of the time to put on his evidence properly if he doesn't agree up front to just let a few lawyers represent him.
[00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:04.112]  If he does that, they're gonna hang him out to dry.
[00:29:04.132 --> 00:29:04.513]  What do you think?
[00:29:05.768 --> 00:29:09.530]  Well, I think the president faces a couple of threshold questions first, Alex.
[00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:13.872]  First, there is the question as to whether they can legally impeach him at all.
[00:29:14.372 --> 00:29:15.993]  He's no longer in office.
[00:29:16.073 --> 00:29:17.513]  He has ceded the presidency.
[00:29:17.853 --> 00:29:18.974]  We have a new president.
[00:29:19.374 --> 00:29:27.598]  So, removing him from office, which is the specific wording of the Constitution, that's not possible because he's not in office.
[00:29:28.178 --> 00:29:30.399]  He could litigate that matter immediately.
[00:29:30.819 --> 00:29:34.541]  Then, secondarily, there's the question of who will preside.
[00:29:35.365 --> 00:29:37.627]  The Constitution is absolutely clear.
[00:29:37.667 --> 00:29:42.651]  It says the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court shall preside.
[00:29:43.432 --> 00:29:45.694]  Chief Justice Roberts has declined to preside.
[00:29:46.174 --> 00:29:50.758]  Nowhere does it say that the fuzzy-headed Senator from Vermont shall preside.
[00:29:50.858 --> 00:29:53.420]  I looked in the Constitution, there's no reference to him.
[00:29:53.901 --> 00:29:59.205]  So, there's a constitutional question there which the President could also litigate.
[00:29:59.605 --> 00:30:00.406]  Here's the question.
[00:30:01.147 --> 00:30:05.709]  Today I believe that those who seek to impeach our president do not have the votes.
[00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:11.993]  The question is, if the process drags on, will they gain votes?
[00:30:12.033 --> 00:30:13.814]  Will the opposition gain votes?
[00:30:13.934 --> 00:30:23.559]  Is the president better going to a quick but forceful trial, or is he better off stretching this out by litigating those two points?
[00:30:24.139 --> 00:30:27.841]  The other key issue, who will represent the president?
[00:30:28.613 --> 00:30:38.358]  If the President is represented by Pat Cipollone and Ed Hirschman and the people in the White House Counsel's Office, these people are playing to lose.
[00:30:38.899 --> 00:30:39.799]  Those aren't fighters.
[00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:41.920]  The President needs a fighter.
[00:30:42.381 --> 00:30:45.542]  Rudy Giuliani is a great man, but he has a conflict.
[00:30:45.602 --> 00:30:48.044]  He will be a witness in this trial.
[00:30:48.304 --> 00:30:49.965]  So he can't represent the President.
[00:30:50.485 --> 00:30:58.031]  I understand that Alan Dershowitz, and nobody can argue that he is not a brilliant lawyer, has withdrawn, although he still supports the President.
[00:30:58.371 --> 00:31:00.773]  So he cannot represent the President.
[00:31:01.093 --> 00:31:06.537]  The President needs a forceful legal team that is very aggressive.
[00:31:06.918 --> 00:31:08.619]  And I don't see that happening today.
[00:31:09.239 --> 00:31:22.172]  It bothers me that these lawyers in South Carolina, who I'm sure are highly capable folks when it comes to South Carolina state law, have been retained on the recommendation of Lindsey Graham.
[00:31:22.572 --> 00:31:23.313]  Lindsey Graham?
[00:31:24.105 --> 00:31:25.365]  Is he an ally of the President?
[00:31:25.745 --> 00:31:26.646]  What day of the week is it?
[00:31:26.666 --> 00:31:27.746]  It's very hard to tell.
[00:31:27.766 --> 00:31:33.667]  I can't get out of my mind that video of him high-fiving Kamala Harris on the floor of the U.S.
[00:31:33.707 --> 00:31:34.047]  Senate.
[00:31:34.448 --> 00:31:35.008]  It's troubling.
[00:31:35.448 --> 00:31:44.470]  So, the President needs a strong legal advocate, and I hope he will find one, because his legacy is completely tied up in this question.
[00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:51.212]  We cannot let them erase the most significant political movement in American history.
[00:31:51.752 --> 00:31:52.632]  I totally agree.
[00:31:53.710 --> 00:32:04.994]  This is the most improbable victory in 2016 and his accomplishments in view of the implacable opposition of the leadership of both parties are historic.
[00:32:05.334 --> 00:32:08.655]  But right now they want to erase Donald J. Trump from the history books.
[00:32:09.016 --> 00:32:10.236]  We cannot let that happen.
[00:32:11.249 --> 00:32:20.954]  That's right, and some people are like, oh, Trump didn't fight hard enough, or Trump didn't stop the election fraud early, or Trump didn't fight the censorship, so let's just forget him.
[00:32:21.334 --> 00:32:24.135]  They're going to sell the idea that this was a real assault on the Capitol.
[00:32:24.155 --> 00:32:30.178]  They're going to sell the fraudulent idea that Trump was behind it to kill the entire nationalist populist legacy.
[00:32:30.458 --> 00:32:33.519]  We want Trump strong to help get patriots elected.
[00:32:33.559 --> 00:32:37.101]  We want Trump strong because he really won the election, and I like what
[00:32:38.257 --> 00:32:42.638]  But the head of Newsmax, Chris Ruddy, said last night, Trump is popular all over the world.
[00:32:43.019 --> 00:32:53.042]  If he doesn't act like he's unpopular, and if he goes out there and represents Americana and speaks out against Joe Biden and his anti-American activities,
[00:32:54.062 --> 00:32:55.003]  He will be a powerful force.
[00:32:55.023 --> 00:32:59.304]  That's why they're trying to silence President Trump everywhere, but it's not going to work in the long run.
[00:33:00.305 --> 00:33:00.945]  Stay right there.
[00:33:00.985 --> 00:33:02.086]  We have Roger Stone with us.
[00:33:02.126 --> 00:33:05.247]  Roger, you've got a lot of websites, a lot of great places to visit.
[00:33:05.267 --> 00:33:06.708]  I know you're working on a big book that's coming out.
[00:33:07.488 --> 00:33:09.189]  Briefly, what's the best website for people to visit?
[00:33:10.089 --> 00:33:13.511]  Right now, people should go to StoneColdTruth.com and subscribe.
[00:33:13.691 --> 00:33:14.232]  It's free.
[00:33:14.792 --> 00:33:17.133]  We have a complete revamp coming up shortly.
[00:33:17.173 --> 00:33:25.898]  I think you're really going to like it, but if you want to know what I'm doing, if you want to know what I think, if you want to buy any of my great products, my books, my t-shirts, that's the place to go.
[00:33:25.998 --> 00:33:27.359]  StoneColdTruth.com.
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:31.362]  Absolutely, and Roger, I appreciate you keeping them in the fight, and thanks for keeping us in the fight.
[00:33:31.702 --> 00:33:34.303]  We'll be back with more of Roger Stone, and Owen's got some comments as well.
[00:33:34.323 --> 00:33:34.724]  Stay with us.
[00:33:35.584 --> 00:33:38.426]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, and I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:33:39.545 --> 00:33:41.606]  And we have Roger Stone with us for one more segment.
[00:33:41.626 --> 00:33:47.670]  Then when we start the next hour, Pelosi just said this morning there are enemies within the Capitol that the Republicans want to kill her.
[00:33:48.271 --> 00:33:49.091]  But they have guns.
[00:33:49.291 --> 00:33:50.752]  So this is the new hysteria.
[00:33:51.073 --> 00:33:52.954]  There's people with guns everywhere they want to kill.
[00:33:53.654 --> 00:33:57.777]  And the Democrats need to arrest everybody and take our speech away because they're all in so much danger.
[00:33:58.477 --> 00:33:59.978]  And Infowars is fomenting violence.
[00:33:59.998 --> 00:34:01.159]  We've got to be taken off the air.
[00:34:01.739 --> 00:34:03.901]  So they can then provocateur their organizations.
[00:34:04.537 --> 00:34:06.938]  They're set up groups in my name if I'm off air.
[00:34:07.338 --> 00:34:09.980]  Then say Alex Jones said do this because I won't be on air.
[00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:12.621]  They can then speak in my voice and then blame me.
[00:34:12.701 --> 00:34:14.682]  That's how they work once they censor you.
[00:34:15.142 --> 00:34:24.467]  Roger Stone, let's talk more about what Trump could do with his new office of the former president and Chris Ruddy talking about how he could be the president of the world.
[00:34:24.487 --> 00:34:25.147]  He really could.
[00:34:25.668 --> 00:34:34.112]  But I think if he's continued to be represented by these mainline Republicans, I think if he just kind of is silent because he could have a press conference, it's going to end up in the news.
[00:34:36.502 --> 00:34:37.902]  I just think he's licking his wounds.
[00:34:38.242 --> 00:34:39.882]  I know you talk to the President quite a bit.
[00:34:40.523 --> 00:34:43.083]  What can you tell us about what his thinking might be right now, Roger?
[00:34:44.144 --> 00:34:49.245]  Well, first and foremost, Donald Trump is far from finished when it comes to being a force.
[00:34:50.465 --> 00:34:55.907]  And the America First wing of the Republican Party is still the dominant wing at the grassroots level.
[00:34:56.678 --> 00:35:01.321]  That's why the Republicans in the Senate are petrified by this talk of a new party.
[00:35:01.761 --> 00:35:04.103]  Some have called it the American Patriot Party.
[00:35:05.083 --> 00:35:26.237]  Donald Trump's supporters are still dominant at any level of the Republican Party, and I argue against the formation of a new party, although at the moment it is a very significant threat to those Republicans in the Senate who may be worried about the reaction back home if they oppose the President and they vote for his impeachment.
[00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:30.205]  There's a number of reasons why the new party is not a good idea.
[00:35:30.285 --> 00:35:33.469]  First and foremost is the question of ballot access.
[00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:40.619]  Remember, the rules about getting on the ballot in every state are written by Republicans and Democrats working together.
[00:35:41.235 --> 00:35:48.602]  Both to make intra-party contests as difficult as possible to get on the ballot, and also getting on the ballot for general elections.
[00:35:49.122 --> 00:35:52.065]  It's expensive, it's time-consuming, it's arcane.
[00:35:52.425 --> 00:35:57.370]  You're talking about millions and millions and millions of dollars just to get on the ballot.
[00:35:57.931 --> 00:36:06.919]  Then, of course, there's the Commission on Presidential Debates, which is not a commission, not appointed by the president, and most certainly not about debate.
[00:36:07.535 --> 00:36:11.139]  There's no guarantee that a new party candidate would get in those debates.
[00:36:11.199 --> 00:36:13.942]  In fact, the guarantee is that they won't.
[00:36:14.422 --> 00:36:19.968]  There have been litigations by Ralph Nader, Pat Buchanan, Governor Gary Johnson over the years.
[00:36:20.508 --> 00:36:21.590]  They have all failed.
[00:36:22.110 --> 00:36:25.093]  That's another impediment to a new party.
[00:36:25.814 --> 00:36:30.699]  And then, most importantly, let's recognize that there's no reason to leave the Republican Party.
[00:36:31.326 --> 00:36:35.268]  As Senator Barry Goldwater said, this is our historic home.
[00:36:35.648 --> 00:36:37.009]  We are a majority.
[00:36:37.249 --> 00:36:48.734]  What we need to do is to go into primaries and challenge those Republicans, those RINOs, who don't support our principles, who are part of the Washington swamp, and they vote that way.
[00:36:49.254 --> 00:36:51.195]  We can be dominant in primaries.
[00:36:51.235 --> 00:36:55.517]  So for example, Senator Marco Rubio here in my home state of Florida.
[00:36:56.081 --> 00:36:56.882]  He's a nice guy.
[00:36:56.942 --> 00:36:57.922]  I get along well with him.
[00:36:57.982 --> 00:36:59.683]  I like him on a personal level.
[00:37:00.143 --> 00:37:01.284]  But he's a neocon.
[00:37:01.484 --> 00:37:02.245]  We disagree.
[00:37:02.645 --> 00:37:08.208]  And I guarantee you he's going to have a significant, real challenge in the Republican primary.
[00:37:08.268 --> 00:37:21.936]  Not a symbolic challenge of just putting your name on the ballot, but someone who will run and wage an excellent, well-funded campaign on the precepts of America First, on the precepts of the Trump agenda.
[00:37:23.237 --> 00:37:25.378]  Roger, let me speak to that because this is so central.
[00:37:26.457 --> 00:37:30.140]  Soros and the Globalists don't fund third parties because they don't work.
[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:38.906]  They might be a one-issue deal to stop fracking or this or that, so they'll fund it just to give it legitimacy to shut off our energy supplies like the Green Party.
[00:37:39.813 --> 00:37:42.656]  When you pull back from this, it's taking over parties you want to do.
[00:37:42.716 --> 00:37:44.519]  It's Soros and the Globalists that have taken over.
[00:37:44.939 --> 00:37:47.282]  The Democrats, the Communist Chinese have taken them over.
[00:37:47.622 --> 00:37:49.945]  They're putting in their DAs, they're putting in their Attorney Generals.
[00:37:50.325 --> 00:37:50.966]  It's a nightmare.
[00:37:51.367 --> 00:37:54.190]  We need, as American people, to control at least one party.
[00:37:54.530 --> 00:37:55.852]  We almost got there with Trump.
[00:37:55.952 --> 00:37:57.454]  I agree, that's why they fear him so much.
[00:37:57.494 --> 00:37:58.435]  He won in a landslide.
[00:37:58.775 --> 00:37:59.515]  You're absolutely right.
[00:37:59.535 --> 00:38:00.816]  We do not need this third party.
[00:38:01.236 --> 00:38:06.498]  That is a nuclear option down the road just for him to run for president or something if he had to.
[00:38:06.858 --> 00:38:08.258]  But he's not going to be barred from that.
[00:38:08.298 --> 00:38:10.279]  He's going to defeat this trial in the Senate.
[00:38:10.819 --> 00:38:16.641]  And I really think that he should run for governor or senator or maybe he should run against Rubio.
[00:38:16.661 --> 00:38:21.702]  I mean, I really think we need to get President Trump back in, back in D.C.
[00:38:21.722 --> 00:38:24.803]  That is what we need to be the real leader of the Republican Party.
[00:38:24.843 --> 00:38:26.204]  And I think after he's been through
[00:38:26.944 --> 00:38:43.212]  Well, those who criticize the President for the way he handled the post-election period have to recognize that there are two factors here that have to be taken into consideration.
[00:38:43.832 --> 00:38:48.334]  One, of course, are the legal options, but the others are the political options.
[00:38:48.955 --> 00:38:51.816]  As Abraham Lincoln said, public opinion is everything.
[00:38:52.556 --> 00:38:55.998]  And the fact that the Internet censorship issue was never dealt with,
[00:38:56.491 --> 00:39:06.377]  The fact that the President's supporters were widely deplatformed created a backdrop in which the President's options were extraordinarily limited.
[00:39:06.777 --> 00:39:10.399]  You can't do anything in America without public support.
[00:39:10.739 --> 00:39:11.319]  It's crucial.
[00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:22.686]  So, I agree with you, Alex, that the formation of a new party would merely split the right-of-center vote and guarantee the election of Democrats as far as the eye can see.
[00:39:23.346 --> 00:39:40.071]  It's a bad idea, but I can tell you there's a number of Republican senators crapping their pants right now about the idea and the possibility of both being challenged in a general election by a new party or being challenged in the Republican primary.
[00:39:41.869 --> 00:39:46.673]  The Trump wing of the party is still dominant and will be dominant on into the future.
[00:39:47.073 --> 00:39:50.456]  The America First agenda is not just going away.
[00:39:50.876 --> 00:39:58.322]  The RINOs may think they're going to pick up control of the Republican Party like a checked hat, but they're wrong about that.
[00:39:58.622 --> 00:39:59.683]  Now I would like to see
[00:40:00.504 --> 00:40:08.827]  A complete financial audit of every dollar, every penny that was spent by the Republican National Committee since Donald Trump was elected president.
[00:40:09.347 --> 00:40:11.567]  I don't think they have spent their money effectively.
[00:40:12.108 --> 00:40:13.988]  I'd like to know where that money went.
[00:40:14.508 --> 00:40:17.489]  I think the president has a right to know where that money went.
[00:40:18.029 --> 00:40:24.451]  I've seen the Republican National Committee being extraordinarily ineffective on behalf of this president.
[00:40:24.471 --> 00:40:24.912]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:40:24.952 --> 00:40:29.173]  And a lot of the former RNC guys go to work for the, a lot of the RNC guys go to work.
[00:40:30.017 --> 00:40:30.738]  Go ahead, I'm sorry.
[00:40:31.138 --> 00:40:32.079]  No, no, no, go ahead.
[00:40:33.299 --> 00:40:42.566]  Look, I would not donate a penny to the Republican National Committee, and I would urge those out there in the Infowars audience to follow in suit.
[00:40:42.686 --> 00:40:46.189]  There's no chance that money is being spent effectively.
[00:40:47.490 --> 00:40:50.152]  Okay, amazing points, but please go back to
[00:40:51.115 --> 00:40:59.923]  What Ruddy said about Trump could be really the president of the world for nationalism, for patriotism, for populism, for better trade deals, for things like that.
[00:41:00.423 --> 00:41:05.808]  And seeing him not basically just be silent.
[00:41:05.828 --> 00:41:06.969]  I know you talked to the president.
[00:41:07.310 --> 00:41:08.491]  How's the president doing?
[00:41:09.572 --> 00:41:11.013]  What do you think he's going to do in the future?
[00:41:11.073 --> 00:41:13.455]  When should we expect to see him come back on the scene?
[00:41:13.775 --> 00:41:15.477]  Or is he focusing on the trial in the Senate first?
[00:41:16.707 --> 00:41:20.929]  Well, I have not spoken to him specifically about those points, so I cannot address them.
[00:41:21.649 --> 00:41:27.191]  But anyone who thinks that he is spent as a force doesn't understand the situation.
[00:41:27.812 --> 00:41:33.874]  I do think that he can be a very effective critic of the Biden administration policies.
[00:41:34.474 --> 00:41:38.356]  I do think that there has to be a reasonable time lag here.
[00:41:39.176 --> 00:41:42.098]  The new president is just kind of getting out of the gate.
[00:41:42.118 --> 00:41:43.838]  The stock market kind of reflects that.
[00:41:43.918 --> 00:41:44.979]  Not going too well, is it?
[00:41:46.055 --> 00:41:49.316]  But I do think he has to be measured at first in his criticism.
[00:41:49.816 --> 00:41:51.437]  But he will always have an audience.
[00:41:51.477 --> 00:41:57.498]  He will always have the majority voice, both within the party and a huge voice in the country.
[00:41:58.439 --> 00:42:04.901]  Anybody who knows him, and I do, knows that he's a fighter, knows that he's a brawler, knows that he hasn't given up on America.
[00:42:05.421 --> 00:42:06.621]  I'm sure he's disappointed.
[00:42:06.841 --> 00:42:09.982]  I'm sure he's angry about being banned on Twitter.
[00:42:10.618 --> 00:42:13.662]  Means he should have joined other platforms previously.
[00:42:14.262 --> 00:42:18.107]  Putting all your eggs in the Twitter basket turned out to be an enormous mistake.
[00:42:18.747 --> 00:42:20.590]  I can tell him about that first hand.
[00:42:21.571 --> 00:42:24.194]  We are going to need to solve that problem first.
[00:42:24.913 --> 00:42:32.057]  The Trump movement, the America First movement, has no future as long as there is censorship of the internet.
[00:42:32.458 --> 00:42:35.520]  It is the number one issue in the country.
[00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:38.181]  It was four years ago when you and I raised it.
[00:42:38.521 --> 00:42:40.483]  We have talked about it ad nauseum.
[00:42:40.943 --> 00:42:44.205]  It cost us the election exactly as we predicted it would.
[00:42:44.765 --> 00:42:52.610]  It has to be solved and it can only be solved by the formation of new platforms that are not built on sand.
[00:42:53.308 --> 00:43:04.211]  If you build your platform, as say Parler did, on an Amazon-based system, if you build your platform or you count on Facebook or Twitter, it's a fool's errand.
[00:43:04.731 --> 00:43:13.734]  We need viable, uncensored platforms on email so we can contact... Roger, I want to say this in closing.
[00:43:13.754 --> 00:43:14.694]  I want to say this in closing.
[00:43:15.155 --> 00:43:16.435]  The way they've built the internet now,
[00:43:17.468 --> 00:43:20.469]  These big five tech companies have about 95% of the infrastructure.
[00:43:20.549 --> 00:43:27.052]  It's almost impossible to have a gigantic website without their infrastructure unless you have over a billion dollars.
[00:43:27.172 --> 00:43:31.853]  And that's the problem is people don't know what a monopoly there is of infrastructure.
[00:43:31.953 --> 00:43:37.575]  InfoWars has tried with tens of millions of dollars a year to just have infrastructure that was taken away from us.
[00:43:37.835 --> 00:43:40.316]  And that's why we have such a big bill to fund things.
[00:43:40.336 --> 00:43:42.537]  But I absolutely concur with you, Roger.
[00:43:42.557 --> 00:43:43.758]  Great to have you back on.
[00:43:44.038 --> 00:43:44.658]  Thank you so much.
[00:43:45.666 --> 00:43:47.048]  Well, Alex, it's great to be with you.
[00:43:47.148 --> 00:43:51.855]  One thing you don't have to worry about when it comes to the dog collars, they'll never make one big enough for you.
[00:43:54.278 --> 00:43:54.679]  All right.
[00:43:54.739 --> 00:43:54.999]  Oh, yeah.
[00:43:55.019 --> 00:43:56.762]  Well, they got the new COVID dog collars.
[00:43:56.782 --> 00:43:58.163]  We'll be right back with our number two.
[00:43:58.184 --> 00:43:58.404]  Thank you.
[00:44:00.267 --> 00:44:05.112]  Well, it looks like this is the part of the revolution where they start throwing their political opponents in jail.
[00:44:05.673 --> 00:44:06.493]  Wow, that was fast.
[00:44:06.934 --> 00:44:09.216]  It was just a week ago they were telling us about unity.
[00:44:09.316 --> 00:44:09.857]  Remember that?
[00:44:10.477 --> 00:44:15.823]  What we didn't know at the time is they meant that everyone with power should unite against the rest of the country.
[00:44:16.544 --> 00:44:18.326]  Unity meant oligarchy.
[00:44:19.026 --> 00:44:19.086]  Oh.
[00:44:19.927 --> 00:44:21.947]  Doug Mackey learned that the hard way this morning.
[00:44:21.987 --> 00:44:24.888]  Mackey is a 31-year-old conservative journalist from Florida.
[00:44:25.448 --> 00:44:28.029]  At 7 a.m., FBI agents showed up at Mackey's house.
[00:44:28.069 --> 00:44:29.969]  They threw him in handcuffs and they dragged him to a cell.
[00:44:30.469 --> 00:44:32.070]  He now faces 10 years in prison.
[00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:33.270]  His crime?
[00:44:33.790 --> 00:44:36.491]  He made fun of powerful Democrats on social media.
[00:44:37.031 --> 00:44:45.633]  As the federal criminal complaint puts it, quote, Mackey made coordinated use of social media to spread disinformation relevant to the impending 2016 presidential election.
[00:44:47.694 --> 00:44:54.181]  This disinformation, the Biden administration solemnly explained, quote, often took the form of memes.
[00:44:55.703 --> 00:44:56.384]  Yes, memes.
[00:44:57.044 --> 00:44:58.146]  Online mockery.
[00:44:58.846 --> 00:45:02.250]  Mockery online is now illegal when it's aimed at the wrong people.
[00:45:02.951 --> 00:45:05.514]  Doug Mackey hurt their feelings, so they put him in jail.
[00:45:06.309 --> 00:45:10.570]  According to Joe Biden's Justice Department, Doug Mackey violated 18 U.S.
[00:45:10.610 --> 00:45:11.191]  Code Section 241.
[00:45:12.411 --> 00:45:18.713]  He did this by tricking people, like the dastardly trickster that he is, into not voting in the presidential election.
[00:45:19.553 --> 00:45:26.615]  What's interesting is that prosecutors showed no evidence whatsoever that Doug Mackey actually tricked anyone into anything, voting or not.
[00:45:26.735 --> 00:45:28.036]  Not a single person.
[00:45:29.090 --> 00:45:31.072]  But that doesn't matter, shrieks CNN.
[00:45:31.572 --> 00:45:34.695]  Doug Mackey is a bad person with bad views.
[00:45:34.755 --> 00:45:37.036]  And by the way, we have no idea what Doug Mackey's views are.
[00:45:37.497 --> 00:45:38.137]  We don't care.
[00:45:38.858 --> 00:45:41.500]  What CNN is telling us is that those views are a crime.
[00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:42.321]  He's a criminal!
[00:45:42.761 --> 00:45:43.241]  Lock him up!
[00:45:43.281 --> 00:45:45.683]  Give him a longer sentence than we give to rapists!
[00:45:46.464 --> 00:45:47.345]  Which they're trying to do.
[00:45:48.265 --> 00:45:51.248]  As of tonight, that is the official position of the Lynch Mob channel.
[00:45:52.372 --> 00:45:54.333]  But hold on a minute, as a legal matter.
[00:45:54.973 --> 00:45:56.453]  Have you ever read 18 U.S.
[00:45:56.493 --> 00:45:57.693]  Code Section 241?
[00:45:57.753 --> 00:45:58.974]  Probably not, but you should.
[00:45:59.554 --> 00:45:59.974]  Look it up.
[00:46:00.874 --> 00:46:07.176]  When you read it, you will learn that Joe Biden's Justice Department is lying in a very obvious way, and that should make you very nervous.
[00:46:08.216 --> 00:46:13.858]  It turns out that federal law does not ban memes, or for that matter, misinformation, whatever that is.
[00:46:14.781 --> 00:46:23.563]  The law that Biden's prosecutors are citing instead prohibits, quote, conspiring to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate anyone from exercising the right to vote.
[00:46:24.263 --> 00:46:29.024]  According to the law, that would include kidnapping voters, invading their homes, sexually abusing them.
[00:46:29.624 --> 00:46:33.265]  Doug Mackey didn't do any of that, not even close to any of that.
[00:46:33.625 --> 00:46:34.765]  Doug Mackey made memes.
[00:46:35.465 --> 00:46:37.386]  Therefore, he's a domestic terrorist.
[00:46:37.886 --> 00:46:38.966]  Speech is violence.
[00:46:39.026 --> 00:46:40.166]  Dissent is a felony.
[00:46:41.406 --> 00:46:44.547]  What, you may be wondering, does a case like this mean for the First Amendment?
[00:46:45.287 --> 00:46:47.689]  Well, it means that it's effectively suspended.
[00:46:48.410 --> 00:46:50.571]  You can now be arrested for saying the wrong things.
[00:46:50.671 --> 00:46:51.392]  And at 7 a.m.
[00:46:51.432 --> 00:46:53.714]  this morning, one journalist actually was arrested for that.
[00:46:54.615 --> 00:46:56.396]  Almost no one tonight seems to be defending him.
[00:46:56.456 --> 00:46:57.277]  He had bad thoughts!
[00:46:57.297 --> 00:46:57.957]  He deserves it!
[00:46:59.198 --> 00:46:59.979]  They think it's okay.
[00:47:00.459 --> 00:47:01.640]  And that shouldn't surprise you.
[00:47:02.141 --> 00:47:05.123]  Because we're clearly living under some form of martial law at the moment.
[00:47:05.704 --> 00:47:06.284]  How do we know that?
[00:47:06.304 --> 00:47:07.605]  Well, here's one indication.
[00:47:07.965 --> 00:47:11.208]  There are nearly 10,000 federal troops in our capital city tonight.
[00:47:11.388 --> 00:47:11.989]  Ooh, that's a hint.
[00:47:12.915 --> 00:47:13.575]  Why are they there?
[00:47:14.036 --> 00:47:15.156]  How long will they be staying?
[00:47:15.937 --> 00:47:21.080]  No one is being very specific about any of that, so you're left to draw your own conclusions, which people naturally are.
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:23.501]  And by the way, it's not making anyone more moderate.
[00:47:24.202 --> 00:47:30.886]  If you're really worried about extremism, you probably wouldn't put 10,000 federal troops in your capital city, making everyone more radical and crazy.
[00:47:31.987 --> 00:47:32.867]  But they don't care about that.
[00:47:33.527 --> 00:47:38.390]  The point of this whole highly militarized exercise is to remind you of what Chairman Mao once famously said.
[00:47:38.931 --> 00:47:40.852]  Political power grows from the barrel of a gun.
[00:47:41.781 --> 00:47:42.882]  Unfortunately, that is true.
[00:47:43.783 --> 00:47:45.244]  In every country, at all times.
[00:47:46.105 --> 00:47:49.267]  Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy is no genius, but he does understand that.
[00:47:50.028 --> 00:47:54.532]  As he explained today, as long as his political opponents exist, those soldiers will stay.
[00:47:56.109 --> 00:47:58.511]  The threat to the country is not over, right?
[00:47:58.551 --> 00:48:02.935]  We still have 5,000 National Guard members surrounding the Capitol complex.
[00:48:03.075 --> 00:48:03.395]  Why?
[00:48:03.735 --> 00:48:08.659]  Because there are still existing threats, present threats, to the security of the Capitol.
[00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:18.608]  And so, so long as Donald Trump is empowered by Senate Republicans, there is still the chance that he is going to incite another attempt at the Capitol.
[00:48:18.748 --> 00:48:21.270]  The threat is still very real to American democracy.
[00:48:22.734 --> 00:48:22.994]  Okay.
[00:48:23.635 --> 00:48:33.143]  So as long as there are people in this country who persist in disagreeing with Chris Murphy, explains Chris Murphy, we're going to need to keep thousands of heavily armed soldiers on the scene.
[00:48:33.283 --> 00:48:33.964]  Why specifically?
[00:48:34.004 --> 00:48:38.548]  Because, and we're quoting now, the threat is still very real to American democracy.
[00:48:39.889 --> 00:48:42.170]  But wait, democracy requires soldiers?
[00:48:42.830 --> 00:48:44.151]  We thought it was voluntary.
[00:48:44.971 --> 00:49:05.339]  If you're starting to think that maybe someone at some point secretly redefined the term democracy, changing its meaning to roughly 180 degrees from what it was just last year... We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance, with Owen Schroyer and his co-host, me, Alex Jones.
[00:49:06.738 --> 00:49:09.739]  Well, you notice everything we talk about just keeps coming true.
[00:49:09.759 --> 00:49:11.080]  Just like you're turning the page of the book.
[00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:23.485]  And that's because the globalists run the planet and now they want to run your everyday life and your body and put in you what they want and they want to be able to arrest you and disappear you and re-educate you and kill you.
[00:49:24.571 --> 00:49:32.495]  And they're all over the news saying, let's be violent, let's attack Republicans, let's attack Conservatives, let's attack Christians, let's firebomb Baptist churches.
[00:49:32.575 --> 00:49:33.215]  It's wonderful.
[00:49:33.595 --> 00:49:39.358]  The Southern Poverty Law Center puts a map up and the firebombs and bullets just start coming and it won't even make the local news.
[00:49:40.478 --> 00:49:46.061]  Because that Baptist Church, Hispanic Baptist Church in Southern California, deserve to be burned to the ground.
[00:49:48.282 --> 00:49:50.283]  Because they're the peaceful guys, they're the good guys.
[00:49:51.766 --> 00:50:04.856]  And just last night, Tucker Carlson laid out the fact that they're now coming to arrest their political enemies and Senator Murphy, who on record is Senator Blumenthal, quarterbacking all these fake lawsuits against us with the goal of taking us off air.
[00:50:07.938 --> 00:50:09.719]  He says, oh, we need to keep troops in D.C.
[00:50:09.739 --> 00:50:10.180]  forever.
[00:50:11.421 --> 00:50:15.444]  Because a million people showed up for a Trump rally to say, we know you stole the election.
[00:50:16.284 --> 00:50:18.146]  And a few people, I've watched the videos,
[00:50:18.953 --> 00:50:21.814]  About a hundred Antifa were egging people on trying to break in.
[00:50:22.874 --> 00:50:26.075]  Three Proud Boys did the wrong thing, or are they provocateurs?
[00:50:26.115 --> 00:50:26.696]  Are they infiltrators?
[00:50:26.756 --> 00:50:27.116]  I don't know.
[00:50:28.216 --> 00:50:39.240]  And some Boogaloos, who again are a minority of the group, break in, four of them get killed, four citizens get killed, a cop has a heart attack, and this is the end of the world.
[00:50:41.971 --> 00:50:53.002]  And now Nancy Pelosi in a press conference today said there's an enemy within because members of Congress have concealed carry and own firearms.
[00:50:53.583 --> 00:50:57.587]  No, it's your people that shot Scalise and tried to kill the other 18 baseball players.
[00:50:58.108 --> 00:51:00.911]  It's your people that call for all this violence.
[00:51:02.449 --> 00:51:03.770]  This is the upside down world.
[00:51:03.950 --> 00:51:05.230]  They know they stole the election.
[00:51:05.290 --> 00:51:08.171]  They know that they put a corpse in the White House.
[00:51:08.211 --> 00:51:10.292]  The media always calls and says, you mean he has a threat?
[00:51:10.352 --> 00:51:15.174]  No, I mean, he looks like... I've seen dead bodies that look better than Joe Biden.
[00:51:16.035 --> 00:51:18.276]  I've sat there and looked at a lot of my dead family.
[00:51:19.436 --> 00:51:22.217]  I'm the type of person that when they're dead at the morgue, I go look at them to say bye.
[00:51:23.518 --> 00:51:25.819]  And so I've looked at my dead family members, okay?
[00:51:26.279 --> 00:51:27.800]  And they looked better dead.
[00:51:29.411 --> 00:51:31.731]  Before they were even embalmed, than Joe Biden looks.
[00:51:32.252 --> 00:51:37.053]  So, they have put this monster in there, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:51:37.993 --> 00:51:43.194]  They have put this individual in there, and they think we're going to buy it.
[00:51:43.214 --> 00:51:54.336]  They think they're going to gaslight us out of this, and they're on every channel going, we're going to re-educate them, and we're going to reprogram them, and we're going to take them to camps, and we're going to have to... And they've got the FBI calling us up.
[00:51:56.215 --> 00:51:59.959]  And they've got their infiltrators in all the organizations, and oh, Parler!
[00:52:00.039 --> 00:52:02.782]  Oh, the president might have gone to Parler, so we banned it.
[00:52:03.883 --> 00:52:05.124]  Oh, now Telegram!
[00:52:05.164 --> 00:52:06.345]  People are using it to talk!
[00:52:06.565 --> 00:52:07.787]  We can't let Americans talk!
[00:52:08.627 --> 00:52:09.228]  Just like that.
[00:52:09.729 --> 00:52:10.770]  We're inside Communist China.
[00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:12.151]  I want to get Owen Schroer's take on this.
[00:52:12.732 --> 00:52:15.414]  Ride the shotgun with me, and I appreciate him being here and doing a great job.
[00:52:16.315 --> 00:52:19.919]  But let's go ahead and play what Pelosi had to say just hours ago.
[00:52:22.014 --> 00:52:40.082]  I do believe, and I have said this all along, that we will probably need a supplemental for more security for members when the enemy is within the House of Representatives, a threat that members are concerned about, in addition to what is happening outside.
[00:52:40.642 --> 00:52:43.323]  But I think that, again, it's in that letter.
[00:52:46.073 --> 00:52:48.856]  It's just a matter of communicating to them that has been done.
[00:52:49.276 --> 00:52:50.997]  The MRA, the rest of that.
[00:52:51.578 --> 00:53:03.348]  I do think, though, that while it's appropriate that they use their MRA for their security, they shouldn't have to, because that money is there for them to meet the needs of their constituents.
[00:53:04.549 --> 00:53:13.397]  In the meantime, to protect themselves and their constituents when they communicate with them, that that is confidential, private, and not
[00:53:14.181 --> 00:53:17.462]  What exactly did you mean when you said the enemy is within?
[00:53:17.743 --> 00:53:24.465]  It means that we have members of Congress who want to bring guns on the floor and have threatened violence on other members of Congress.
[00:53:42.554 --> 00:53:44.978]  That, of course, is a complete and total lie.
[00:53:46.155 --> 00:53:56.557]  They are just mad that everywhere InfoWars type folks, patriots, Trump supporters, Constitutionals, populists are getting elected, including a large crop of smart, attractive women, which is great by me.
[00:53:56.957 --> 00:54:10.079]  Attractive or not, it's a good thing to have good spokespersons for liberty, feisty young women who are smart and know what's going on, and the system is crapping its dirty britches over all of this.
[00:54:10.139 --> 00:54:11.120]  And so this is the theme.
[00:54:11.620 --> 00:54:13.100]  This is where they're going, the purge.
[00:54:14.148 --> 00:54:14.828]  I don't know.
[00:54:35.157 --> 00:54:37.738]  Sterilize our boys, though some people are letting their kids be sterilized.
[00:54:37.998 --> 00:54:39.559]  We're going to fight to keep our country sovereign.
[00:54:39.579 --> 00:54:41.399]  We're going to fight to take care of our veterans in the VA.
[00:54:41.439 --> 00:54:44.421]  We're going to fight to not have one-sided trade deals.
[00:54:44.441 --> 00:54:45.481]  You know what fight means?
[00:54:46.061 --> 00:54:48.222]  Like, I'm going to fight for my children in a custody battle.
[00:54:48.562 --> 00:54:50.983]  Or I'm going to fight against this cancer for my life.
[00:54:51.343 --> 00:54:53.544]  Or I'm going to fight against this alcoholism issue.
[00:54:53.824 --> 00:54:58.426]  Or I'm going to fight against this issue I have with, say, agoraphobia.
[00:54:59.997 --> 00:55:01.899]  I'm not speaking about myself.
[00:55:02.079 --> 00:55:04.441]  I'm saying, I don't have agoraphobia, obviously.
[00:55:04.681 --> 00:55:06.823]  What I'm saying is you're going to fight this illness.
[00:55:07.469 --> 00:55:08.950]  You're going to fight this drug addiction.
[00:55:09.230 --> 00:55:10.931]  You're going to fight this communist takeover.
[00:55:10.951 --> 00:55:12.312]  You're going to fight this New World Order.
[00:55:12.612 --> 00:55:18.675]  But I got to tell you, if they do start grabbing everybody for no reason and putting us in camps, I mean, I guess they're going to get the fight they want.
[00:55:19.075 --> 00:55:25.979]  They just up front want to start a fight with us, make sure it's badly coordinated, make sure it makes us look stupid, so they can then start the purge.
[00:55:26.579 --> 00:55:29.701]  And people go, well, I'm just going to let them purge things because I don't want to look bad.
[00:55:29.761 --> 00:55:31.622]  I mean, they really are trying to start a war, OK?
[00:55:33.027 --> 00:55:35.448]  And so, this is a dystopia.
[00:55:35.468 --> 00:55:36.768]  They've decided to go dystopic.
[00:55:37.088 --> 00:55:38.549]  They've decided to go over the edge of the cliff.
[00:55:38.929 --> 00:55:42.410]  They've decided to go all the way, and so we got a big case of tyranny.
[00:55:42.770 --> 00:55:43.930]  Big case of high-tech tyranny.
[00:55:44.170 --> 00:55:46.491]  They envy the fact that Putin is authoritarian.
[00:55:46.691 --> 00:55:48.311]  They envy Xi Jinping.
[00:55:48.351 --> 00:55:48.832]  They admit it.
[00:55:48.872 --> 00:55:50.012]  They want to be like that.
[00:55:50.632 --> 00:55:53.793]  They're trying to bring us where China is, Owen Schroyer.
[00:55:54.554 --> 00:55:59.816]  That's a pretty astounding clip of Pelosi saying that they need more security because of Republican Congress people.
[00:56:00.056 --> 00:56:05.379]  Hey lady, it was your supporter went and shot Scalise and tried to kill 18 others, you lying sack of garbage.
[00:56:05.659 --> 00:56:06.659]  Burn in hell, Pelosi.
[00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:09.021]  And by that I mean when you die, may God have judgment on you.
[00:56:09.461 --> 00:56:10.581]  I think God's sending you to hell.
[00:56:10.601 --> 00:56:11.402]  That's what I mean by that.
[00:56:11.422 --> 00:56:11.882]  Go ahead, Owen.
[00:56:12.222 --> 00:56:21.450]  Yeah, and of course we have to add those caveats now to everything we say, because everything we say is now being scrutinized and investigated by the DOJ and the FBI as incitement.
[00:56:21.870 --> 00:56:26.354]  Of course, Democrats' speech, no matter what they say, is never considered incitement.
[00:56:26.434 --> 00:56:30.058]  I mean, if we had a level playing field, everything Nancy Pelosi just said
[00:56:30.578 --> 00:56:31.719]  Would be considered incitement.
[00:56:31.759 --> 00:56:33.401]  The enemy is within the Capitol grounds?
[00:56:33.421 --> 00:56:40.587]  Well, is she not now inciting her people, which don't really exist, but say she had people to go into the Capitol and riot?
[00:56:41.087 --> 00:56:42.188]  The enemy's in the Capitol?
[00:56:42.469 --> 00:56:43.209]  Oh, that's incitement!
[00:56:43.289 --> 00:56:44.771]  I'm gonna go to the Capitol and riot!
[00:56:45.211 --> 00:56:46.933]  So, again, it's just the double standard.
[00:56:47.293 --> 00:56:54.780]  But, you know, getting back to the Biden issue here, Alex, I was looking at this today, and I just have one little printout here, it doesn't really work for the printout, but I was looking at
[00:56:55.984 --> 00:56:56.324]  We're good to go.
[00:57:16.428 --> 00:57:25.830]  Two of the top three word associations with Biden on the search trend were pedophilia and dementia.
[00:57:26.710 --> 00:57:29.590]  So the world knows who this guy is.
[00:57:30.051 --> 00:57:31.751]  Guys, by the way, lay that paper back down.
[00:57:31.771 --> 00:57:32.791]  I know they can zoom in more.
[00:57:33.351 --> 00:57:34.351]  Lay it back down where you had it.
[00:57:36.432 --> 00:57:39.152]  They should just do this because it doesn't really look good on the printout.
[00:57:39.872 --> 00:57:41.313]  I don't care.
[00:57:41.333 --> 00:57:41.993]  Still zoom in on it.
[00:57:42.033 --> 00:57:42.533]  No, they can do it.
[00:57:42.553 --> 00:57:43.013]  They can zoom in.
[00:57:43.573 --> 00:57:45.034]  That camera's got like five times more zoom.
[00:57:45.514 --> 00:57:47.776]  Just zoom in on that, guys, because this is huge.
[00:57:47.816 --> 00:57:49.357]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:57:49.637 --> 00:57:51.538]  They've taken the comments off his videos.
[00:57:51.838 --> 00:57:53.860]  They've taken the like buttons off because everybody hates him.
[00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:54.680]  Exactly.
[00:57:55.020 --> 00:57:57.242]  I mean, can you believe they're trying to sell us this guy?
[00:57:57.602 --> 00:58:00.664]  Not only that, there's a story out today in the Western Journal.
[00:58:02.025 --> 00:58:06.448]  17% of Biden voters would have abandoned him if they knew about stories that the media censored.
[00:58:06.908 --> 00:58:10.050]  That's enough, even with the fake numbers, to give Trump the victory.
[00:58:10.570 --> 00:58:11.111]  I agree.
[00:58:11.191 --> 00:58:12.712]  Owen, they did the close shot.
[00:58:12.792 --> 00:58:13.372]  Flipped the page.
[00:58:13.412 --> 00:58:14.973]  I've got this OCD thing issue I've got.
[00:58:14.993 --> 00:58:15.914]  I just need this to happen.
[00:58:16.514 --> 00:58:17.215]  Oh, it's about to happen.
[00:58:17.635 --> 00:58:19.356]  Oh, oh, oh, we're actually showing him.
[00:58:19.376 --> 00:58:20.177]  Yeah, Alex, look at that.
[00:58:20.237 --> 00:58:22.399]  Joe Biden pedophilia number three.
[00:58:22.499 --> 00:58:23.539]  How do you like that?
[00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:26.241]  And ladies and gentlemen, I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:58:27.142 --> 00:58:28.903]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[00:58:28.963 --> 00:58:30.524]  Owen Schroer is riding shotgun with me.
[00:58:30.544 --> 00:58:34.027]  I want to get into some good news, Owen, and then I want to hit a whole bunch of other stuff with you.
[00:58:34.067 --> 00:58:34.947]  I know you've got a lot to cover.
[00:58:35.608 --> 00:58:36.188]  Next segment.
[00:58:36.208 --> 00:58:39.150]  I want to talk about some positive news first.
[00:58:40.455 --> 00:58:45.998]  But I want to let listeners also know Stuart Rhodes, Founder of Oath Keepers, will be joining us in the last 30 minutes of the next hour.
[00:58:46.458 --> 00:58:52.101]  We have another one of the Boogaloo leaders joining us to talk about what really happened at the Capitol.
[00:58:53.001 --> 00:58:58.965]  You know, I have to say that the Boogaloo guy we had on yesterday did some cheap shots saying, you know, that I might be in the CIA or a Fed.
[00:58:59.705 --> 00:59:02.887]  But I get from his perspective, I'm saying that to him.
[00:59:03.427 --> 00:59:05.088]  But only because you can't swing a stick
[00:59:05.996 --> 00:59:07.537]  In any of these groups and not hit a Fed.
[00:59:08.077 --> 00:59:10.458]  I mean, look at the Enrique Tarrio thing coming out.
[00:59:10.498 --> 00:59:12.258]  He's been a federal informant for many, many years.
[00:59:13.379 --> 00:59:14.139]  Is he a bad guy?
[00:59:14.159 --> 00:59:18.360]  No, I mean, I like Enrique, but that just goes with the territory, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:21.221]  It's the same thing with the Boogaloos, the same thing with any of this.
[00:59:21.761 --> 00:59:26.523]  And I've been through this for 27 years with provocateur groups trying to get people to do illegal things.
[00:59:27.043 --> 00:59:28.644]  I never saw Enrique do any of that.
[00:59:29.548 --> 00:59:31.869]  So I'm not demonizing him.
[00:59:31.889 --> 00:59:35.510]  I think the Proud Boys are good guys overall because they don't believe in offensive violence.
[00:59:35.550 --> 00:59:41.972]  But I've seen the footage and there were some Proud Boys at the front of the line that have been arrested who helped break into the Capitol.
[00:59:42.273 --> 00:59:43.693]  Do they deserve all these giant charges?
[00:59:43.753 --> 00:59:43.933]  No.
[00:59:43.993 --> 00:59:47.094]  But what they did was illegal.
[00:59:47.114 --> 00:59:49.055]  I mean, they did attack cops that didn't do anything.
[00:59:49.535 --> 00:59:50.115]  And it's on video.
[00:59:50.535 --> 00:59:52.656]  And I'm not going to just sit up here and pretend that didn't happen.
[00:59:52.976 --> 00:59:54.617]  That's not how we want to behave.
[00:59:55.663 --> 00:59:58.125]  And there were other provocateurs there clearly egging it on.
[00:59:58.145 --> 00:59:59.025]  They're not getting arrested.
[00:59:59.565 --> 01:00:00.946]  So that tells you what's going on here.
[01:00:01.326 --> 01:00:03.388]  The vast majority of the Proud Boys tried to stop it.
[01:00:03.448 --> 01:00:04.228]  That's on video.
[01:00:04.568 --> 01:00:07.110]  Them trying to stop the other few Proud Boys that did it, but they couldn't.
[01:00:07.850 --> 01:00:08.791]  Were those infiltrators?
[01:00:09.151 --> 01:00:09.571]  Probably.
[01:00:09.811 --> 01:00:11.512]  Will they quietly drop charges on them later?
[01:00:11.853 --> 01:00:14.774]  Yeah, those are the ones you'll know are feds when they drop the charges.
[01:00:15.295 --> 01:00:19.217]  But they protect their informants and their provocateurs by indicting them up front.
[01:00:19.877 --> 01:00:22.359]  So we're going to watch this all very, very closely.
[01:00:23.649 --> 01:00:25.090]  That's why they don't want us on air.
[01:00:25.150 --> 01:00:35.055]  But when you hear me up here harping on this, and harping on not being violent, and harping on if you're in a militia or something and people are calling for offensive violence, that's a federal informant guaranteed.
[01:00:35.095 --> 01:00:38.036]  And they're always going to be like, Jones is a wimp.
[01:00:38.076 --> 01:00:39.277]  He doesn't want to stand up.
[01:00:39.617 --> 01:00:40.757]  He doesn't want to do anything.
[01:00:41.258 --> 01:00:43.059]  When you hear that, it's a standard script.
[01:00:43.339 --> 01:00:43.559]  Okay?
[01:00:45.199 --> 01:00:47.842]  Now, and this is serious business, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:48.323 --> 01:00:49.024]  This is serious.
[01:00:49.084 --> 01:00:50.946]  We were going to expose the fraud at that Capitol.
[01:00:50.966 --> 01:00:53.069]  We were going to have a million-person peaceful march.
[01:00:53.970 --> 01:00:59.717]  And there were almost no police there that day, like 15 police, when you know hundreds of thousands are coming.
[01:01:00.117 --> 01:01:01.079]  This was a setup.
[01:01:01.119 --> 01:01:01.880]  They opened the door.
[01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:02.661]  It's disgusting.
[01:01:03.789 --> 01:01:07.453]  And so we've got to be as wise as serpents and peaceful as doves, as Jesus said.
[01:01:08.394 --> 01:01:11.337]  And again, if somebody attacks you, defend yourself 110% of your might.
[01:01:12.058 --> 01:01:16.163]  But this was not just a party and woo-woo, you know, we king of the hill.
[01:01:16.223 --> 01:01:17.964]  We took the hill and we're in fifth grade.
[01:01:18.425 --> 01:01:22.549]  This is serious, serious business toe-to-toe with the new world order.
[01:01:22.569 --> 01:01:23.651]  At least we're fighting back.
[01:01:23.671 --> 01:01:24.452]  Nobody said it would be easy.
[01:01:25.636 --> 01:01:31.240]  Let's finish up on this subject, then I want to get to going on the offense peacefully and what Rand Paul is announcing some exciting things next segment.
[01:01:31.461 --> 01:01:32.581]  But Owen, your view on this?
[01:01:32.962 --> 01:01:33.602]  I agree with you.
[01:01:34.343 --> 01:01:37.245]  Biden's super unpopular, stole the election, all the metrics show it.
[01:01:37.925 --> 01:01:38.246]  Super...
[01:01:40.461 --> 01:01:45.084]  Out of control, butchering the country, shutting the economy off day one, stock market plunging.
[01:01:45.105 --> 01:01:47.126]  I mean, I want unity.
[01:01:47.206 --> 01:01:48.807]  I don't want to fight with the average Democrat.
[01:01:49.027 --> 01:01:52.150]  We need a populist movement that is for common sense in this country.
[01:01:52.210 --> 01:02:06.601]  I'm glad you've been bringing that up because we get so partisan, especially under the last few years with Trump, that that's something that actually energized the worst elements of the Soros left to kind of take over the populist liberals and who are on average not bad people and I think could be reached out to.
[01:02:06.621 --> 01:02:07.021]  What do you think?
[01:02:07.568 --> 01:02:14.998]  Well, you know, it's harder to kind of get a feel just in a social life right now because there's not much of it because of the COVID shutdown.
[01:02:15.038 --> 01:02:16.940]  But we do have, you know, some of that here in Texas.
[01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:24.009]  So when I go out, whether it's to dinner or a grocery store or the gym, you know, I try to talk to people, get an idea of what they're thinking.
[01:02:24.590 --> 01:02:25.731]  And there's no doubt that
[01:02:26.212 --> 01:02:28.674]  I mean, there's no popularity for Biden.
[01:02:28.775 --> 01:02:33.219]  I mean, and Trump being out of the picture is now allowing people to see things clearer.
[01:02:33.239 --> 01:02:38.944]  It's almost like Trump, because of the media, was like a blockade for people to really, just neutral people that weren't politically informed.
[01:02:39.525 --> 01:02:41.407]  He was kind of a blockade to see what was really going on.
[01:02:41.447 --> 01:02:42.388]  Now that he's out of the way,
[01:02:42.748 --> 01:02:44.168]  And they can't just blame Trump for everything.
[01:02:44.208 --> 01:02:45.209]  Now they kind of see everything.
[01:02:45.309 --> 01:02:46.789]  Oh, they're rigging the stock market.
[01:02:47.149 --> 01:02:48.390]  Oh, the media is still fake.
[01:02:48.470 --> 01:02:50.470]  Oh, they're still encroaching on our free speech.
[01:02:50.510 --> 01:02:52.031]  They're still encroaching on our Second Amendment.
[01:02:52.411 --> 01:02:53.331]  And Trump's out of the picture.
[01:02:53.351 --> 01:02:54.352]  So it's like, oh, OK.
[01:02:54.552 --> 01:02:55.572]  It really is bigger than Trump.
[01:02:55.612 --> 01:02:57.993]  But here's the headline from NBC News, Alex.
[01:02:59.193 --> 01:03:01.254]  Their inaction cost lives.
[01:03:02.333 --> 01:03:02.613]  U.S.
[01:03:02.653 --> 01:03:04.695]  Capitol Police Union rebukes leadership.
[01:03:04.755 --> 01:03:06.958]  And of course, we've had two of the U.S.
[01:03:06.998 --> 01:03:08.739]  Capitol Police now commit suicide.
[01:03:08.799 --> 01:03:13.024]  So, internally, the police know what happened that day.
[01:03:13.064 --> 01:03:21.051]  There was a stand down, and of course it's Pelosi who is in charge of all this, and then working with Mayor Muriel Bowser before
[01:03:21.852 --> 01:03:30.097]  January 6th to make sure that they had the right amount of stand down from the police to allow something like this to happen.
[01:03:30.117 --> 01:03:31.058]  They got overwhelmed.
[01:03:31.398 --> 01:03:32.639]  It was impossible to stop it.
[01:03:32.999 --> 01:03:39.623]  By the time we got there and you put forth four or five efforts on a megaphone to say, hey, stand down, get out of the Capitol.
[01:03:39.883 --> 01:03:40.604]  This is peaceful.
[01:03:40.644 --> 01:03:41.745]  We don't want to be like the left.
[01:03:42.225 --> 01:03:45.247]  You know, by the time we were on that effort, it was just too late.
[01:03:45.287 --> 01:03:47.488]  I mean, there was already 100,000 people surrounding the Capitol.
[01:03:47.788 --> 01:03:50.070]  We were watching Trump's speech when it was happening.
[01:03:50.490 --> 01:03:57.599]  So, you know, all of this is starting to come to the fore, Alex, and I think I'm making a serious effort right now to unify.
[01:03:57.679 --> 01:04:02.624]  I may not agree with Black Lives Matter, and maybe down the road we can have policy and political debates.
[01:04:03.285 --> 01:04:04.467]  I don't agree with Antifa.
[01:04:04.507 --> 01:04:06.349]  Of course, they're kind of the only ones really in the shadow.
[01:04:06.369 --> 01:04:07.871]  I mean, you want to talk about domestic terror groups.
[01:04:08.251 --> 01:04:08.892]  Let's be clear.
[01:04:08.932 --> 01:04:09.452]  Let's be clear.
[01:04:09.533 --> 01:04:10.233]  Let's be clear, Owen.
[01:04:11.169 --> 01:04:15.790]  What you're saying is, people duped by Black Lives Matter, we want to wake them up and reach out to them.
[01:04:16.030 --> 01:04:18.151]  People duped by Antifa, we want to reach out to them.
[01:04:18.391 --> 01:04:21.251]  But we know Soros and the Globalists run both those groups, exactly.
[01:04:21.632 --> 01:04:25.873]  I mean, we're never going to convince those hardcore mercenaries that are part of the system to do that.
[01:04:26.193 --> 01:04:26.993]  They're part of the power cult.
[01:04:27.013 --> 01:04:29.633]  But absolutely, we need to now that Trump's out of the way.
[01:04:29.653 --> 01:04:32.994]  Because Trump was good in some ways, but bad in others because he was so polarizing.
[01:04:33.054 --> 01:04:34.315]  Now, you're absolutely right.
[01:04:34.335 --> 01:04:35.355]  People are going, whoa.
[01:04:36.195 --> 01:04:37.216]  Biden didn't really win.
[01:04:37.236 --> 01:04:38.236]  This guy can't even talk.
[01:04:38.256 --> 01:04:39.797]  In fact, we'll play some clips of that next segment.
[01:04:40.377 --> 01:04:41.818]  Have you seen the latest videos?
[01:04:41.858 --> 01:04:44.560]  I mean, he does not know what planet he's on.
[01:04:45.529 --> 01:04:46.430]  No, it's not good.
[01:04:46.470 --> 01:04:48.451]  I mean, the Biden versus the pen.
[01:04:48.471 --> 01:04:51.752]  I mean, he's coming out, he's making statements that don't even make sense.
[01:04:51.772 --> 01:04:53.173]  I mean, he's falling apart at the seams.
[01:04:53.213 --> 01:04:55.354]  I don't know how they're going to pull this off, Alex.
[01:04:55.394 --> 01:04:56.495]  They can't hide him forever.
[01:04:57.335 --> 01:05:06.120]  You know, they can't keep him hopped up on whatever drugs they have him hopped up on without there being some serious side effects soon down the road, I believe.
[01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:14.705]  And I think what it is, is though, you know, the other thing too, is because of Trump, more people were watching politics than ever before, especially here in America.
[01:05:15.245 --> 01:05:19.066]  So now, oh, you know, Biden is with us.
[01:05:19.226 --> 01:05:20.546]  Oh, the establishment is with us.
[01:05:20.586 --> 01:05:21.686]  Hollywood cares about us.
[01:05:21.986 --> 01:05:24.067]  Well, they're learning the hard way, as you were saying.
[01:05:24.147 --> 01:05:24.707]  No, they don't.
[01:05:24.767 --> 01:05:25.607]  They were using you.
[01:05:25.647 --> 01:05:26.447]  They set you up.
[01:05:26.547 --> 01:05:29.408]  And they don't give a rat's you-know-what about you.
[01:05:29.468 --> 01:05:31.148]  And so they're finding this out the hard way.
[01:05:31.448 --> 01:05:39.930]  But it opens up ripe ground, I think, for unity, for anti-establishment people, left, right, center, whatever, to say, hey, look, this is what's happening.
[01:05:40.410 --> 01:05:53.728]  I think what happened in the stock market with GameStop and AMC and the rest is just a perfect example of the grassroots people unifying, learning they have power and unification to take on the establishment and then what happens?
[01:05:53.768 --> 01:05:55.371]  They're learning the hard way what happens when you do it?
[01:05:55.771 --> 01:05:59.734]  Well, they come down on you and the whole establishment cuts you off from being free.
[01:06:00.154 --> 01:06:01.715]  And so this is an awakening, Alex.
[01:06:01.735 --> 01:06:03.436]  We're in a new stage of awakening.
[01:06:03.676 --> 01:06:10.381]  I think it's going to be about a three-month process to really codify what it's going to look like, what it's going to mean, and then see it on the other side.
[01:06:11.201 --> 01:06:12.482]  And then I think we'll have a better idea.
[01:06:12.842 --> 01:06:13.602]  Who's with us?
[01:06:14.102 --> 01:06:14.963]  Who's against us?
[01:06:15.383 --> 01:06:16.543]  Who wants to unify?
[01:06:16.864 --> 01:06:24.627]  And who are the people now we need to be talking about or, you know, focusing on and saying, hey, look, this person betrayed you.
[01:06:25.067 --> 01:06:26.148]  This person lied.
[01:06:26.468 --> 01:06:27.728]  This person deceived you.
[01:06:28.028 --> 01:06:33.551]  And then we can kind of move forward together and just say, hey, look, we got to we got to restore the system for everybody.
[01:06:34.329 --> 01:06:34.970]  That's right, Owen.
[01:06:35.110 --> 01:06:35.530]  Stay there.
[01:06:35.550 --> 01:06:37.571]  When we come back, I want to go through a bunch of clips.
[01:06:37.632 --> 01:06:41.915]  First, Senator Rand Paul and Rush Limbaugh here today, saying it's time to rebel against the mask.
[01:06:41.935 --> 01:06:43.436]  That video's on Infowars.com.
[01:06:43.936 --> 01:06:45.698]  Rand Paul calls for mask rebellion.
[01:06:45.718 --> 01:06:47.779]  This is what we need to hear from leaders like him.
[01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:49.541]  This is the stuff of victory.
[01:06:49.781 --> 01:06:55.225]  We'll talk about the path to victory, to stop the global lockdown, to stop the Great Reset, the Build Back Better Takeover.
[01:06:55.245 --> 01:06:55.805]  We'll be right back.
[01:06:57.306 --> 01:07:00.609]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:07:01.550 --> 01:07:02.891]  Very honored to be here and to be your host.
[01:07:05.914 --> 01:07:12.717]  I want to thank all of our great radio affiliates, all of our great TV affiliates.
[01:07:12.737 --> 01:07:13.737]  We're getting more affiliates.
[01:07:14.778 --> 01:07:16.139]  People used to tune into this show.
[01:07:16.159 --> 01:07:21.341]  A lot of station managers would have us on overnight or they'd hear me on another station that was smaller.
[01:07:21.361 --> 01:07:24.303]  I think this guy is a good talk show host, but he's crazy.
[01:07:24.343 --> 01:07:25.683]  This stuff's not going to come true.
[01:07:26.104 --> 01:07:28.645]  And now they're like, oh my God, everything he said came true.
[01:07:28.725 --> 01:07:29.445]  Well, absolutely.
[01:07:29.725 --> 01:07:31.526]  Because I'm going off what the globalists say they're going to do.
[01:07:31.646 --> 01:07:32.667]  I know it sounds crazy.
[01:07:33.524 --> 01:07:36.126]  But they said by 2020, we'll start to global depopulation.
[01:07:37.047 --> 01:07:44.292]  And we've got to first have simulant bioweapons that lock everything down, so that when we release real bioweapons, things don't get out of control and we're killing everybody.
[01:07:46.254 --> 01:07:52.959]  And clearly, these mRNA vaccines are a binary weapon that weaken your immune system, I now admit, so that when they release another similar virus, it kills you dead in a hammer.
[01:07:53.719 --> 01:08:03.307]  So everyone is, right now, doing like a wedding rehearsal, or a rehearsal for their own destruction.
[01:08:04.977 --> 01:08:05.577]  That's what this is.
[01:08:05.597 --> 01:08:11.562]  This is a dress rehearsal for hell on earth, and I'm not afraid of the globalists.
[01:08:11.582 --> 01:08:12.322]  I'm not afraid of prison.
[01:08:12.342 --> 01:08:13.063]  I'm not afraid of death.
[01:08:13.143 --> 01:08:33.537]  I love God, and I have a real drive to fight these people, but when I see the level of evil, I see the level of ignorance of the public, and I see my little three-and-a-half-year-old daughter, I have a real instinct to just disappear at our family ranch and live in a trailer and skim bucks and run trot lines and, you know, just go get a job at a gas station or something.
[01:08:34.501 --> 01:08:37.224]  Because I'm not looking to be in DC.
[01:08:37.244 --> 01:08:38.606]  I'm not looking to be in Hollywood.
[01:08:39.346 --> 01:08:41.068]  That's why that Joy Reid piece was so sick.
[01:08:41.088 --> 01:08:44.312]  She goes, these conservatives and Christians and right-wingers want to be us.
[01:08:44.352 --> 01:08:45.773]  They want to be the Hollywood culture.
[01:08:45.993 --> 01:08:47.255]  They want to be the glamour.
[01:08:47.675 --> 01:08:48.656]  And it's so empty.
[01:08:48.776 --> 01:08:50.538]  I can't even watch movies anymore.
[01:08:50.558 --> 01:08:53.561]  I have to go in the woods and hide from people.
[01:08:53.601 --> 01:08:55.063]  I don't want to be anywhere near you people.
[01:08:55.804 --> 01:08:56.705]  I'm talking about the globalists.
[01:08:57.711 --> 01:09:05.297]  And the idea that we want to be them when they want to be us and want to run our lives and put their DNA of dead, aborted kids into us.
[01:09:07.018 --> 01:09:14.684]  And they're just psychotic, ultra rich heirs of the Nazis, German royalty and Transylvanian royalty.
[01:09:15.025 --> 01:09:17.387]  The House of Dracula actually runs it all.
[01:09:17.447 --> 01:09:23.531]  And it's just like, and the Q people are like, I've got a relationship with Q and the President Jones.
[01:09:23.651 --> 01:09:24.092]  Shut up.
[01:09:25.820 --> 01:09:27.361]  And then the media was like, oh, it's all discredited.
[01:09:27.381 --> 01:09:28.481]  There's no pedophile rings.
[01:09:28.501 --> 01:09:29.502]  There's no new world order.
[01:09:29.702 --> 01:09:33.143]  Because the Q thing didn't happen the way Q said.
[01:09:33.203 --> 01:09:41.227]  It was all to set everybody up and to take real topics, exaggerate them a hundred times, and then discredit the whole thing.
[01:09:42.487 --> 01:09:44.168]  And some folks listened, some didn't.
[01:09:44.188 --> 01:09:47.709]  They just thought, oh, Jones, you're just jealous of the Q power.
[01:09:48.770 --> 01:09:50.831]  Three years ago when that thing started, if you promoted it,
[01:09:52.967 --> 01:09:53.387]  It was weird.
[01:09:53.407 --> 01:09:57.169]  I'd say a few positive things about Q. Everything else I said was banned on YouTube.
[01:09:57.209 --> 01:09:59.070]  Suddenly, that would have 5 million views and was allowed to be on there.
[01:09:59.530 --> 01:10:00.650]  I'm like, well, it must be bad.
[01:10:00.690 --> 01:10:01.811]  And then I researched it.
[01:10:02.311 --> 01:10:03.952]  And I don't want to go back to the Q thing.
[01:10:03.992 --> 01:10:04.392]  It's just that...
[01:10:05.444 --> 01:10:28.315]  It's so frustrating that we have global reset, world government, forced inoculations, global passports that you've been inoculated, they're announcing them, global social credit scores, hell on earth, a totally corrupt big tech that runs slave camps in China, totally surveilling us in a huge organized crime op, oppressing an entire class of Americans, Christians, conservatives, Trump supporters, populists, gun owners.
[01:10:30.347 --> 01:10:31.507]  Nativists, as they call us.
[01:10:32.288 --> 01:10:33.268]  Even libertarians.
[01:10:33.588 --> 01:10:36.649]  And they're saying they want to arrest us and use the CIA on us.
[01:10:36.969 --> 01:10:38.090]  That doesn't scare me.
[01:10:38.710 --> 01:10:40.730]  It really makes me feel like a sack of garbage.
[01:10:41.991 --> 01:10:43.931]  That our country is really this sick.
[01:10:44.972 --> 01:10:46.752]  And we really have this sick people.
[01:10:47.193 --> 01:10:48.693]  They're like, oh, who wants the republic?
[01:10:48.733 --> 01:10:49.433]  Who wants freedom?
[01:10:49.713 --> 01:10:50.694]  Who wants what's so great?
[01:10:50.974 --> 01:10:54.475]  Let's just crap on our birthright and bring in total world government.
[01:10:57.136 --> 01:10:57.476]  And so,
[01:11:00.617 --> 01:11:05.080]  And the willfulness of the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal to lie.
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:15.786]  And just when you run headlong into just how many evil people they've organized who are willing to do anything and say anything and do anything because they feel like they're on a winning team.
[01:11:17.907 --> 01:11:24.691]  And I just have a sense, politically, spiritually, economically, culturally, historically, that this is not going to go well.
[01:11:27.652 --> 01:11:28.373]  I mean, they say that
[01:11:30.182 --> 01:11:33.325]  Biden called up and basically threatened Putin the other day with war.
[01:11:33.886 --> 01:11:38.210]  So Putin came out and they're bragging about it on the news, like Colbert's like, the new normal's back.
[01:11:38.690 --> 01:11:41.553]  You know, he called up and threatened Putin and Putin's like, well, we could have nuclear war.
[01:11:41.593 --> 01:11:42.394]  This is super dangerous.
[01:11:42.854 --> 01:11:45.216]  And these people just have Titanic written all over them.
[01:11:45.757 --> 01:11:46.878]  Hollywood's collapsed.
[01:11:47.218 --> 01:11:52.643]  The globalists are all a bunch of Bernie Madoffs that created tens of trillions of fake, thousands of trillions of fake money.
[01:11:53.264 --> 01:11:54.325]  And it's a sinking ship.
[01:11:55.509 --> 01:12:01.731]  And so anybody that thinks a violent war with a security apparatus is going to turn us around is wrong.
[01:12:02.111 --> 01:12:04.232]  We are a corrupt, satanic civilization.
[01:12:04.672 --> 01:12:06.073]  And I'm a sinner too, I'm not perfect.
[01:12:06.573 --> 01:12:13.996]  And just the level of God's spirit being taken out of the world, the level of Satanism being poured into it, it's incredible.
[01:12:16.237 --> 01:12:19.039]  But for every action, there's an opposite and equal reaction in Newtonian physics.
[01:12:19.159 --> 01:12:28.206]  And finally, Senator Paul, who's a medical doctor, he's not just coming out and saying COVID's overblown, it's exaggerated, you know, you shouldn't have to wear your mask, you've already had it.
[01:12:29.106 --> 01:12:32.409]  He's saying the vaccine doesn't work, it's a fraud, take your mask off, rebel.
[01:12:32.829 --> 01:12:35.351]  There's a full video bringing it down at InfoWars.com.
[01:12:35.691 --> 01:12:37.232]  Rand Paul calls for mask rebellion.
[01:12:37.332 --> 01:12:40.815]  I suggest you share this because you gotta start saying no.
[01:12:40.835 --> 01:12:41.716]  And by the way, I do it.
[01:12:43.037 --> 01:12:43.377]  I do it.
[01:12:44.437 --> 01:12:55.724]  I'm not wearing a mask here, and this is corporate-owned area of Utah, so everybody's wearing them in the stores and on the ski lifts and everywhere else, and to their tables in the restaurants and in the hotel lobbies, and I'm not doing it.
[01:12:56.825 --> 01:13:01.588]  And almost everybody, once they come up and say, please wear your mask, they go, no, I know you're right, I know it's a fraud.
[01:13:02.989 --> 01:13:05.010]  Or, yeah, I had COVID two months ago, it was like a cold.
[01:13:06.391 --> 01:13:08.332]  Or, yeah, I know the testing's almost completely fake.
[01:13:08.613 --> 01:13:12.015]  So that's the good news is, but they need to see that leadership.
[01:13:13.024 --> 01:13:17.469]  And companies need to say, hey, we're going to stop going along with this, because the mask is never coming off.
[01:13:17.509 --> 01:13:18.990]  That's what Fauci and the U.N.
[01:13:19.030 --> 01:13:19.210]  says.
[01:13:19.290 --> 01:13:22.914]  It's a symbol of you're dirty, you're bad, and now they want to inspect the mask.
[01:13:23.215 --> 01:13:24.596]  I said this yesterday.
[01:13:24.656 --> 01:13:25.457]  I said it three days ago.
[01:13:25.497 --> 01:13:26.458]  Fauci says two masks.
[01:13:26.518 --> 01:13:27.759]  I said now they're going to go for three or four.
[01:13:28.180 --> 01:13:30.342]  Now it's all over CNN, NBC, ABC, Today.
[01:13:30.742 --> 01:13:31.663]  You need four masks.
[01:13:31.703 --> 01:13:35.867]  And now somebody went, no, no, no, five, because it's virtue signaling.
[01:13:36.687 --> 01:13:38.149]  This is like The King Has No Clothes.
[01:13:38.189 --> 01:13:41.575]  It's like a children's fable or something of idiocy.
[01:13:42.476 --> 01:13:43.718]  Oh, you've got four masks?
[01:13:43.778 --> 01:13:44.379]  I've got five.
[01:13:44.419 --> 01:13:45.060]  You've got five?
[01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:45.781]  I've got six.
[01:13:46.382 --> 01:13:50.088]  So here is Senator Paul on the Rush Limbaugh program.
[01:13:50.922 --> 01:13:55.968]  This is why when you have these nanny staters who tell you you can go to church, you can't go to church.
[01:13:55.988 --> 01:13:58.591]  You can go to the liquor store, but you can't go to church.
[01:13:58.631 --> 01:14:06.700]  The government shouldn't be involved in these decisions, and it's a mistake that we've allowed the government to get involved, and we do need to push back because they will never relent.
[01:14:07.181 --> 01:14:09.343]  These people are never going to let you not wear a mask.
[01:14:09.804 --> 01:14:10.125]  I don't
[01:14:25.488 --> 01:14:26.849]  None of the mandates have worked.
[01:14:26.930 --> 01:14:31.594]  There's study after study after study that shows that when you put in place these mandates, guess what?
[01:14:31.714 --> 01:14:33.836]  The incidence of the infection kept rising.
[01:14:34.096 --> 01:14:35.717]  Even Biden admitted this the other day.
[01:14:36.037 --> 01:14:39.841]  The trajectory of the virus has been unaffected by anything we've done so far.
[01:14:40.301 --> 01:14:42.263]  Our only hope of changing the trajectory
[01:14:42.992 --> 01:14:44.352]  Oh, and expanding on this...
[01:15:06.355 --> 01:15:09.302]  Again, doctors, scientists, they can't say the mask is a fraud.
[01:15:09.322 --> 01:15:10.525]  They can't say it's a scam.
[01:15:10.565 --> 01:15:11.266]  They all get banned.
[01:15:11.687 --> 01:15:15.015]  Senator Paul's big enough where he can get it out, but now even the president got banned.
[01:15:15.415 --> 01:15:16.758]  That's why this is so damn dangerous.
[01:15:17.964 --> 01:15:36.682]  Well, Alex, when you talk about, you know, escaping to the woods, it's almost an instinctual thing, because it's like we've just arrived at the doors of Mordor, and it's just like plumes of lava are coming at us, and just like fiery arrows, and it's like the scene where Aragorn is just surrounded, and it's like, this is it, you know, but then the ghosts come and save him, and so...
[01:15:37.743 --> 01:15:48.166]  I mean, honestly Alex, there's a weird thing to me too, like on just a competitive human level, where it's just like, I can't even understand for you, you've been in this longer than me, but it's just like, I'm just so bored by this.
[01:15:48.386 --> 01:15:50.467]  I was making fun of the mask a year ago.
[01:15:50.567 --> 01:15:55.129]  I went around in downtown Austin in a hazmat suit, shooting a video making fun of the mask.
[01:15:55.369 --> 01:15:57.649]  People look at me like, oh how rude, how rude.
[01:15:57.669 --> 01:15:58.890]  It's like, no, the whole thing is fake.
[01:15:58.930 --> 01:15:59.510]  We knew it then.
[01:15:59.710 --> 01:16:02.571]  And now we're going to be here in five years if we're not in prison.
[01:16:03.631 --> 01:16:06.272]  Now they're saying actually wear hazmat outfits.
[01:16:06.292 --> 01:16:08.212]  There's nothing these cult followers won't follow.
[01:16:08.392 --> 01:16:10.573]  And the crew can try to find the video from a year ago.
[01:16:10.593 --> 01:16:12.033]  I went out in a hazmat suit making fun of it.
[01:16:12.073 --> 01:16:22.236]  But you know, Alex, it'd be one thing if it was ceremonious with Fauci going on TV and AOC and the squad calling for permanent payouts from the government, direct payouts for the government, total socialism.
[01:16:22.256 --> 01:16:23.556]  But no, I mean, it's real.
[01:16:23.876 --> 01:16:25.256]  Like, they're making you wear the mask.
[01:16:25.276 --> 01:16:26.557]  They're making you take the vaccine.
[01:16:26.577 --> 01:16:27.757]  They're shutting down your church.
[01:16:27.797 --> 01:16:29.437]  They're bankrupting the economy by design.
[01:16:29.978 --> 01:16:30.338]  That's right.
[01:16:30.418 --> 01:16:31.058]  We got a lot coming up.
[01:16:31.989 --> 01:16:34.230]  Owen Schroyer is in the ATX headquarters.
[01:16:34.290 --> 01:16:35.011]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:16:36.091 --> 01:16:37.672]  On the road back tomorrow.
[01:16:37.692 --> 01:16:41.234]  And I really want to thank all the listeners for tuning in to the transmission.
[01:16:41.534 --> 01:16:43.995]  Look, I know why the Q phenomenon was so popular.
[01:16:44.516 --> 01:16:45.936]  People are waking up to the New World Order.
[01:16:45.977 --> 01:16:47.197]  Global government's out in the open.
[01:16:47.237 --> 01:16:48.018]  It's really scary.
[01:16:49.238 --> 01:16:54.161]  And people going back to Barry Goldwater and Cleon Skousen, you know, 60, 70 years ago, exposing it.
[01:16:57.042 --> 01:16:57.783]  And countless others.
[01:16:59.335 --> 01:17:02.276]  My dad and so many others, my dad was fighting this stuff in the early 60s.
[01:17:03.296 --> 01:17:04.176]  Millions of Americans were.
[01:17:05.076 --> 01:17:12.257]  Suddenly somebody rolls in and you got a relationship with the president now and everything's fine and it's secret and everything's gonna be handled.
[01:17:12.277 --> 01:17:12.997]  You don't be scared.
[01:17:13.937 --> 01:17:14.878]  You just trust the plan.
[01:17:16.918 --> 01:17:17.618]  Operation Trust.
[01:17:19.138 --> 01:17:20.779]  And I'm like, no, no, no, we're in trouble.
[01:17:22.279 --> 01:17:23.299]  They're gonna steal the election.
[01:17:23.899 --> 01:17:25.820]  Go watch my Joe Rogan interview three days before the election.
[01:17:26.340 --> 01:17:28.440]  I said Trump wins the landslide and they steal it from him.
[01:17:30.672 --> 01:17:37.717]  Then there'll be 79 days of hell when that's fought over if Trump decides to fight, and then they'll probably stage false flags.
[01:17:40.198 --> 01:17:45.722]  And I said stage mass shootings or truck bombs if we have demonstrations against election fraud.
[01:17:45.762 --> 01:17:48.404]  Instead, they just provocateured and broke into the Capitol.
[01:17:51.414 --> 01:17:52.255]  We fell right into the trap.
[01:17:52.815 --> 01:17:56.978]  And, you know, saying that is what gets us out of trouble in the future.
[01:17:57.398 --> 01:18:03.122]  Being real about the real world, admitting when you're successful, admitting when you're wrong, not being delusional.
[01:18:04.303 --> 01:18:05.824]  And I look at universities here.
[01:18:06.525 --> 01:18:09.207]  Universities threatened to cut off students' internet access.
[01:18:09.607 --> 01:18:11.188]  They failed to comply with COVID restrictions.
[01:18:11.969 --> 01:18:14.050]  And you're going to be tracked on a phone with an app.
[01:18:14.070 --> 01:18:15.131]  It's already happening all over the world.
[01:18:15.371 --> 01:18:17.533]  And they're going to watch you over the Zoom.
[01:18:17.593 --> 01:18:18.994]  And if you're not wearing your mask, even
[01:18:21.035 --> 01:18:27.239]  Remember a few months ago in a Wisconsin government meeting, and somebody wasn't wearing a mask in the state meeting, and they said, well I'm at home.
[01:18:27.259 --> 01:18:28.140]  They said, it doesn't matter!
[01:18:30.582 --> 01:18:32.743]  Colts are about getting you to do things that don't make sense.
[01:18:33.384 --> 01:18:34.224]  Stand on your head.
[01:18:34.304 --> 01:18:35.165]  Wear 10 masks.
[01:18:36.226 --> 01:18:36.966]  Take a vaccine.
[01:18:36.986 --> 01:18:37.987]  By the way, it doesn't protect you.
[01:18:38.007 --> 01:18:38.828]  By the way, it doesn't work.
[01:18:39.248 --> 01:18:40.249]  Why did Merck pull back?
[01:18:40.289 --> 01:18:42.050]  Because they think this is going to fail.
[01:18:42.970 --> 01:18:44.391]  There's a very good chance it's going to fail.
[01:18:44.431 --> 01:18:45.152]  Here's the problem.
[01:18:45.672 --> 01:18:46.353]  I've studied history.
[01:18:47.213 --> 01:18:48.874]  And these are the worst authoritarians I've ever seen.
[01:18:48.894 --> 01:18:51.936]  They're very badly coordinated, but they got a lot of fancy PR firms.
[01:18:52.337 --> 01:19:00.162]  So it's a very sick mix of incompetent globalists on top, following an older plan that's been very successful, but then it's caused a lot of side problems for them.
[01:19:01.723 --> 01:19:06.727]  And then with all this PR garbage trying to gaslight people, it just creates a very explosive situation.
[01:19:08.208 --> 01:19:09.048]  Very, very dangerous.
[01:19:11.030 --> 01:19:16.634]  And so that's really what people need to know and understand is they're taking us to a very bad place.
[01:19:18.413 --> 01:19:21.275]  And the people that have sold out the system are destroying their own future.
[01:19:22.696 --> 01:19:27.620]  And so what tyrants do is once their plans start failing, they double down, double down, double down.
[01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:30.262]  We're now as bad as communist China when it comes to censorship.
[01:19:30.743 --> 01:19:31.783]  My God, they censored the president.
[01:19:32.404 --> 01:19:33.405]  They're taking platforms down.
[01:19:33.585 --> 01:19:35.726]  We're under massive hack attack trying to take us down today.
[01:19:36.167 --> 01:19:42.772]  So that's the message to listeners is please understand that we can't stay on air without your prayers and that isn't
[01:19:45.700 --> 01:19:47.862]  An exaggeration by any stretch of the imagination.
[01:19:47.882 --> 01:19:49.923]  You now realize I'm not joking about any of this.
[01:19:50.043 --> 01:19:52.145]  I wasn't ever exaggerating about any of this.
[01:19:53.185 --> 01:19:55.747]  I wasn't ever embellishing to make it sound scary.
[01:19:57.028 --> 01:20:01.471]  I was believing in you and believing if you were faced with this, you would take action and we could defeat this together.
[01:20:02.412 --> 01:20:08.176]  But that is what this, that is what this comes down to at every single level.
[01:20:08.816 --> 01:20:09.577]  Now I'm going to go ahead.
[01:20:10.956 --> 01:20:13.619]  And I'm going to play this clip of John Kerry.
[01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:17.042]  Here's a clip of John Kerry, the new climate carbon czar.
[01:20:17.082 --> 01:20:21.807]  It's his job to shut down our economy and decide who can stay open, just like they're doing the siege at every other level.
[01:20:22.508 --> 01:20:28.514]  Here is this globalist here to cut off our energy supplies, telling us that it's build back better.
[01:20:28.554 --> 01:20:30.496]  That means after they bankrupt us, the UN takes over.
[01:20:30.516 --> 01:20:31.397]  That's a UN slogan.
[01:20:31.817 --> 01:20:32.418]  Build back better.
[01:20:32.438 --> 01:20:33.219]  It's a communist slogan.
[01:20:33.239 --> 01:20:33.919]  The Chinese use it.
[01:20:34.700 --> 01:20:41.407]  And then he says, showing global unity against us, oh, if you've got an oil field job, don't worry, you'll just go build solar panels.
[01:20:41.427 --> 01:20:42.087]  But no, you won't.
[01:20:42.688 --> 01:20:43.369]  That's all lies.
[01:20:43.389 --> 01:20:44.270]  They build those in China.
[01:20:44.470 --> 01:20:44.830]  Here it is.
[01:20:45.511 --> 01:20:54.860]  President Biden wants to do is make sure those folks have better choices, that they have alternatives, that they can be the people who go to work to make the solar panels.
[01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:56.420]  They were making them here at home.
[01:20:57.001 --> 01:21:02.703]  That is going to be a particular focus of the Build Back Better agenda.
[01:21:03.363 --> 01:21:09.205]  And I think that, unfortunately, workers have been fed a false narrative.
[01:21:09.785 --> 01:21:11.946]  No surprise, right, for the last few years.
[01:21:12.546 --> 01:21:19.149]  They've been fed the notion that somehow dealing with climate is coming at their expense.
[01:21:19.609 --> 01:21:20.149]  No, it's not.
[01:21:21.499 --> 01:21:25.722]  What's happening to them is happening because of other market forces already taking place.
[01:21:26.763 --> 01:21:40.872]  And what the financiers, the big banks, the asset managers, private investors, venture capital are all discovering is there's a lot of money to be made in the creation of these new jobs in these sectors.
[01:21:41.333 --> 01:21:44.295]  So whether it's green hydrogen that is going to come,
[01:21:44.955 --> 01:21:52.757]  Whether it is geothermal heat, whatever it's going to be, those are jobs.
[01:21:53.177 --> 01:22:06.101]  The same worker who works in South Carolina today putting together a BMW, which happens to be made there, and is currently an internal combustion engine, can put together a car, but it's electric.
[01:22:08.901 --> 01:22:11.002]  Okay, so it all sounds real good, except
[01:22:12.017 --> 01:22:14.639]  Spain did exactly this, and they've never come out of their depression.
[01:22:14.659 --> 01:22:17.501]  They have almost 50% unemployment, which is what they want.
[01:22:17.581 --> 01:22:18.562]  Build back better.
[01:22:19.142 --> 01:22:19.963]  Build back better.
[01:22:20.783 --> 01:22:24.346]  Now Owen Shore is going to continue to co-host with me into the fourth hour.
[01:22:24.706 --> 01:22:27.648]  We'll get his take in a few minutes on what we just laid out there.
[01:22:27.668 --> 01:22:30.190]  But I'm going to say this to you right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:22:30.730 --> 01:22:33.252]  If you want to keep us on air, we've got great products you need at the same time.
[01:22:33.272 --> 01:22:36.594]  There's only three days left in our big New Year's sale that we've extended.
[01:22:36.614 --> 01:22:41.318]  A lot of these products are selling out, so these sales will have to end.
[01:22:42.878 --> 01:22:43.879]  This Saturday or Sunday.
[01:22:43.899 --> 01:22:45.621]  I've got to get back to the office, come up with our new sales.
[01:22:45.641 --> 01:22:48.504]  They're going to be limited because a lot of stuff sold out, so I'll take advantage of this now.
[01:22:49.506 --> 01:22:54.651]  Ultra 12 is back in stock after being sold out 50% off.
[01:22:54.671 --> 01:22:56.413]  50% off Super Metal Vitality.
[01:22:56.674 --> 01:22:57.695]  50% off Survival Shield X2.
[01:22:58.115 --> 01:22:59.257]  50% off Alpha Power.
[01:22:59.277 --> 01:23:00.718]  50% off Chill Force.
[01:23:00.738 --> 01:23:02.140]  50% off Lung Cleanse.
[01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:03.161]  50% off Survival Shield X3.
[01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:08.282]  We have the Energize Pack, 40% off Super Mill Vitality, Turbo Force, and Ultra 12.
[01:23:08.662 --> 01:23:12.764]  Revitalize Pack, 40% off Bodies, Vasil Beats, and Knockout.
[01:23:13.104 --> 01:23:15.345]  60% off when you get both packs together.
[01:23:17.006 --> 01:23:20.228]  All of those sales are going to end this weekend, except...
[01:23:21.894 --> 01:23:26.715]  For Ultra 12 because we just got another big shipment of that.
[01:23:26.735 --> 01:23:29.096]  So that'll be our next big sale is the Ultra 12.
[01:23:29.896 --> 01:23:32.057]  We sold out a lot of mineral fusion like I told you we would.
[01:23:32.757 --> 01:23:35.258]  We kept it at 50% off because it's so good for everybody's immune system.
[01:23:35.298 --> 01:23:38.078]  I just wanted you on the fence to get it and experience it.
[01:23:38.118 --> 01:23:38.799]  So we did that.
[01:23:39.179 --> 01:23:39.779]  We have a sell a
[01:23:41.323 --> 01:23:44.844]  A lot of product to fund ourselves when the discounts are this big.
[01:23:44.924 --> 01:23:45.765]  So take advantage of that.
[01:23:45.805 --> 01:23:47.085]  Pollen Block's about to sell out.
[01:23:47.685 --> 01:23:48.886]  Still 25% off.
[01:23:49.006 --> 01:23:50.106]  Alva Power about to sell out.
[01:23:50.767 --> 01:23:51.267]  50% off.
[01:23:51.687 --> 01:23:54.388]  Pure Turmeric Liquid Extract.
[01:23:54.648 --> 01:23:55.188]  25% off.
[01:23:55.348 --> 01:23:56.729]  About to sell out.
[01:23:56.929 --> 01:23:58.770]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:23:59.050 --> 01:23:59.750]  Get a t-shirt.
[01:23:59.790 --> 01:24:00.250]  Get a book.
[01:24:00.330 --> 01:24:01.071]  Get a water filter.
[01:24:01.111 --> 01:24:01.651]  Get an air filter.
[01:24:02.827 --> 01:24:07.468]  We have, of course, ParallelX.com that takes you right to the sub page with the full catalog of my Patriot.
[01:24:07.488 --> 01:24:12.189]  You get the best deals anywhere at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:24:12.210 --> 01:24:14.870]  So I want to salute you and thank you for shopping with us.
[01:24:16.091 --> 01:24:17.171]  We are fighting so hard.
[01:24:17.551 --> 01:24:19.992]  I feel like a weight's off my shoulders because I knew the Globalists were bad.
[01:24:20.012 --> 01:24:22.332]  I knew this was all coming, but now it's so evil.
[01:24:22.372 --> 01:24:23.112]  It's so overwhelming.
[01:24:23.192 --> 01:24:24.973]  I'm just trusting God and trusting
[01:24:26.368 --> 01:24:32.291]  In you, but I gotta tell you, it's only gonna get worse from here on out until we turn this around, until the globalists get defeated like Hitler, okay?
[01:24:32.472 --> 01:24:38.215]  So, seriously, ladies and gentlemen, this is, this is, this is, show over the top, this is scientific tyranny.
[01:24:39.171 --> 01:24:49.454]  Uh, and so just pray to God, take action, spread the word, and share the live links, and share Bandot video, and download all of our films, and download all of our material, because the enemy's fighting to get this off the air.
[01:24:49.874 --> 01:24:54.696]  Long after I'm off air and dead in a ditch somewhere, folks, seriously, I mean, that's probably going to happen.
[01:24:54.716 --> 01:24:58.037]  I'm not trying to be... I think there's a very good chance that they're going to kill me, okay?
[01:24:58.277 --> 01:24:58.877]  That's okay.
[01:24:59.297 --> 01:25:00.357]  Somebody has to fight these people.
[01:25:00.377 --> 01:25:01.198]  They killed all those babies.
[01:25:01.218 --> 01:25:02.078]  Somebody's got to stand up to this.
[01:25:02.378 --> 01:25:04.059]  But I'm telling you, they're coming for you and your family.
[01:25:04.079 --> 01:25:04.859]  They're never going to stop.
[01:25:05.259 --> 01:25:08.100]  And they're just getting the military and police hyped up in this mode to do it.
[01:25:08.700 --> 01:25:11.181]  And then they're going to release the real bio attack and they're going to kill you.
[01:25:11.521 --> 01:25:12.221]  They're going to kill you.
[01:25:12.841 --> 01:25:13.502]  This is their plan.
[01:25:13.682 --> 01:25:15.942]  Bill Gates, Ted Turner, all of them said they're going to release a bio weapon.
[01:25:16.282 --> 01:25:17.283]  Prince Charles, Prince Philip.
[01:25:18.083 --> 01:25:18.883]  So they're running it all.
[01:25:19.183 --> 01:25:25.325]  This is just them testing, putting the handcuffs on you with a simulant weapon, COVID-19, and getting rid of some old people.
[01:25:25.985 --> 01:25:27.926]  I mean, again, they knew they killed 12,000.
[01:25:27.966 --> 01:25:30.007]  The Attorney General of New York covered it up with enjoyment.
[01:25:30.387 --> 01:25:31.907]  Now she's been forced by the feds to release it.
[01:25:31.927 --> 01:25:32.768]  They're murderers.
[01:25:33.508 --> 01:25:34.808]  These are pig-like creatures.
[01:25:35.708 --> 01:25:37.169]  Owen Schroer, your comments on this?
[01:25:38.251 --> 01:25:42.996]  Well, I kind of, I totally relate to what you're saying with the weight being lifted.
[01:25:43.056 --> 01:25:54.587]  I mean, now that they're totally out in the open with their global government plan and their political persecution just being implemented now, there's a weight that it's like, OK, well, here they are.
[01:25:54.647 --> 01:25:55.227]  You were warned.
[01:25:55.488 --> 01:25:57.510]  But there's a new weight of
[01:25:58.746 --> 01:26:00.267]  I mean, how do you even survive this?
[01:26:00.287 --> 01:26:04.048]  I mean, how do you, do you just accept that they're gonna throw you in a gulag?
[01:26:04.108 --> 01:26:05.989]  Or do you accept they're just gonna, you know, hang us all?
[01:26:06.029 --> 01:26:12.571]  I mean, so it's like this new kind of weird time period we're in here, where it's like, okay, they're here, they're coming for us.
[01:26:12.591 --> 01:26:14.352]  All right, where do we stand now?
[01:26:14.412 --> 01:26:16.252]  Where do we lay our roots now?
[01:26:17.113 --> 01:26:21.974]  But they say now in the IB times, COVID is gonna last five years, so they're admitting it's not gonna come out.
[01:26:22.495 --> 01:26:23.115]  Google
[01:26:24.093 --> 01:26:36.721]  He's now taking down Senator Ron Johnson's videos of testimony, sworn under oath testimony of doctors talking about cures for COVID, what's been ignored, the wrongs, the rights.
[01:26:37.021 --> 01:26:39.523]  And Google just says, you know what, you don't get to see that.
[01:26:39.543 --> 01:26:41.744]  You don't get to get sworn testimony under oath.
[01:26:41.784 --> 01:26:42.905]  I mean, it's all here.
[01:26:43.505 --> 01:26:47.047]  And the relief is, Alex, that finally millions of people realized that you were right.
[01:26:47.268 --> 01:26:49.509]  But the problem is, OK, well, they're here.
[01:26:49.549 --> 01:26:50.249]  So now what do we do?
[01:26:50.269 --> 01:26:50.710]  They're coming.
[01:26:51.490 --> 01:26:52.251]  So what do we do now?
[01:26:52.751 --> 01:26:53.091]  That's right.
[01:26:53.131 --> 01:26:56.012]  Back in two minutes, we got a special report coming up and two special guests.
[01:26:56.692 --> 01:26:57.312]  It's Owen Troyer.
[01:26:57.352 --> 01:26:57.973]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:26:58.033 --> 01:26:58.893]  Infowars.com.
[01:26:58.913 --> 01:26:59.813]  Visit it while you still can.
[01:27:00.913 --> 01:27:03.234]  Okay, we have several guests joining us.
[01:27:03.914 --> 01:27:05.355]  One, Stuart Rhodes of Oath Keepers.
[01:27:06.215 --> 01:27:08.976]  They've arrested three of them claiming they were planning to kill people at the Capitol.
[01:27:10.096 --> 01:27:10.696]  Total BS.
[01:27:11.536 --> 01:27:16.458]  And we've also got one of the main Boogaloo boys coming on to talk about the whole purge that's going on, his view on that.
[01:27:16.878 --> 01:27:17.958]  Owen Troyer riding shotgun.
[01:27:17.978 --> 01:27:19.979]  But I want to air this special report that just came out.
[01:27:21.152 --> 01:27:21.412]  Thank you.
[01:27:45.635 --> 01:27:59.251]  At the age of 33, Klaus Schwab, a business professor at the University of Geneva, founded the World Economic Forum in 1971, originally known as the European Management Forum.
[01:28:00.939 --> 01:28:17.754]  Nicknamed Davos after its annual meeting place, the World Economic Forum meets every January with hundreds of members of business, politics, banking, education, and industry to, quote, improve the state of the world.
[01:28:18.996 --> 01:28:23.059]  Their globalist agenda is openly admitted and well documented.
[01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:36.669]  United Nations Agenda 2030, The Great Reset, Build Back Better, are all the same globalist agenda and all stem from the Club of Rome and the eugenics movement.
[01:28:37.930 --> 01:28:48.018]  Davos claims to be looking to save the planet and the UN claim that in 10 years they will end all hunger and poverty on Earth.
[01:28:49.195 --> 01:28:54.099]  They admit that the technologies required to achieve these goals do not exist.
[01:28:54.900 --> 01:29:00.185]  And yet, their solution is to bring the world to zero emissions in only 10 years.
[01:29:01.145 --> 01:29:06.210]  They want to end the automobile and aviation industries in only 10 years.
[01:29:07.131 --> 01:29:12.755]  This is why the Keystone Pipeline was halted on day one by globalist puppet Joe Biden.
[01:29:15.433 --> 01:29:20.937]  Klaus Schwab says that industries which involve human interaction will not survive.
[01:29:21.297 --> 01:29:29.783]  But we know that many industries which rely particularly on physical interaction will have difficulties to survive.
[01:29:30.223 --> 01:29:44.753]  As if the destruction of an entire functioning society will inspire solutions to all of our problems, thereby bringing about an environmental utopia where there is no hunger and all the world is at peace.
[01:29:46.054 --> 01:29:50.478]  As absurd as this all sounds, we know the sheep will accept it as gospel.
[01:29:51.298 --> 01:29:52.319]  They already have.
[01:29:53.500 --> 01:30:00.387]  When the WHO was caught faking a hoax 10 years ago, the media reported it, but nobody cared.
[01:30:01.268 --> 01:30:02.309]  It was a beta test.
[01:30:03.129 --> 01:30:06.853]  Now, the media ignores overwhelming evidence that COVID-19 is a hoax.
[01:30:08.936 --> 01:30:15.800]  They go along with every contradiction and lie, and their audience obediently accepts it all as truth.
[01:30:16.860 --> 01:30:23.484]  The COVID crisis will be used to imprison the population, whether it be in camps or their own home.
[01:30:24.305 --> 01:30:25.505]  It is already happening.
[01:30:26.066 --> 01:30:31.489]  Humanity is being imprisoned by psychopaths who see themselves as our saviors.
[01:30:33.186 --> 01:30:34.547]  Order out of chaos.
[01:30:35.227 --> 01:30:41.690]  The New World Order is nothing other than the decrepit Old World Order desperately clinging to power.
[01:30:42.350 --> 01:30:49.974]  And their solution is to destroy the free market, to destroy the concept of freedom, privacy, and private property.
[01:30:50.974 --> 01:31:03.215]  And to foment enough chaos and destruction to depopulate the earth into a manageable level of serfs and slaves, so they can continue on with the same old scams they've been running for millennia.
[01:31:04.764 --> 01:31:12.349]  This is why Joe Biden signed a dozen executive orders paving the way to opening the borders and shutting down the economy.
[01:31:13.430 --> 01:31:17.372]  The New World Order cannot coexist with American civil liberties.
[01:31:18.153 --> 01:31:24.217]  And now that the populist movement has been discarded, the destruction of America from within can commence again.
[01:31:26.201 --> 01:31:32.666]  If the people of the world continue to comply to these unelected sycophants, then the people will get what they deserve.
[01:31:33.627 --> 01:31:35.889]  For InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[01:31:42.915 --> 01:31:48.058]  Mr. Dunn of the Boogaloos, one of their most prominent people, when they call him the leader of it, he says he's not the leader of it.
[01:31:48.078 --> 01:31:51.881]  I understand he doesn't want to get any repercussions for anything bad that happens associated with it.
[01:31:52.501 --> 01:31:53.482]  He was on the show yesterday.
[01:31:53.522 --> 01:31:54.042]  He attacked me.
[01:31:54.122 --> 01:31:54.602]  I attacked him.
[01:31:54.622 --> 01:31:56.964]  It was still overall a good interview, and he seemed really smart.
[01:31:56.984 --> 01:31:58.004]  I was actually impressed with him.
[01:31:59.045 --> 01:31:59.926]  And maybe he's not a fed.
[01:32:00.965 --> 01:32:04.866]  I just know that it turned out Enrique Tarrio, they burned him.
[01:32:04.926 --> 01:32:06.607]  He was a federal informant for over a decade.
[01:32:06.647 --> 01:32:12.929]  I knew he was a felon for selling unlicensed medical equipment, which I actually looked into his case.
[01:32:12.949 --> 01:32:13.469]  It wasn't that big a deal.
[01:32:13.489 --> 01:32:15.409]  Didn't look like he really did anything, but it doesn't matter.
[01:32:16.750 --> 01:32:23.131]  You can't swing a stick in these paramilitary organizations and not hit a fed because they want to infiltrate and control those.
[01:32:23.852 --> 01:32:26.993]  So the Proud Boys overall are good guys, but they've been demonized.
[01:32:27.013 --> 01:32:28.053]  They've been targeted for destruction.
[01:32:29.517 --> 01:32:31.198]  And now a bunch of them have been arrested.
[01:32:32.019 --> 01:32:34.200]  And I know the Boogaloos bragged about, hey, we're going to the Capitol.
[01:32:34.261 --> 01:32:34.861]  We're going in.
[01:32:34.921 --> 01:32:36.882]  And, you know, Dunn bragged about some of that.
[01:32:36.902 --> 01:32:38.243]  He tried to walk it back yesterday.
[01:32:38.263 --> 01:32:40.365]  I don't want anybody to get in trouble, OK?
[01:32:40.765 --> 01:32:42.126]  There was a lot of energy.
[01:32:42.146 --> 01:32:43.948]  It was like a riot after a football game.
[01:32:44.008 --> 01:32:45.208]  Maybe a couple hundred went in.
[01:32:45.469 --> 01:32:46.730]  Most of them stayed in the velvet ropes.
[01:32:47.410 --> 01:32:51.553]  Nancy Pelosi now says there's enemies within and we've got to arrest everybody, including members of Congress.
[01:32:51.933 --> 01:32:54.035]  I mean, this is drama queen central.
[01:32:56.021 --> 01:33:02.563]  So I just wanted to get the Boogaloos on, the Boogaloo Boys as they're called, to give you their view, their perspective.
[01:33:02.663 --> 01:33:11.547]  I'm told that Magnus Panvidia, they've all got very spectacular names, is also one of the most prominent Boogaloo Boys.
[01:33:12.307 --> 01:33:15.748]  At Magnus Panvidia, I guess on Twitter.
[01:33:15.808 --> 01:33:16.748]  They're on Twitter, I'm not.
[01:33:19.321 --> 01:33:24.286]  I guess he's got, you know, behind him, he's got some different flags, those different political views.
[01:33:24.346 --> 01:33:29.571]  So I really want to get these guys on more than anything to warn them because
[01:33:30.649 --> 01:33:39.434]  I have the Wall Street Journal calling me up, trying to talk to me, saying, oh, you're an instigator with the Boogaloos and the Proud Boys and this and that, and you're trying to get them to do all this.
[01:33:39.835 --> 01:33:44.397]  So even me, who's against offensive violence, they're trying to frame right now.
[01:33:45.018 --> 01:33:46.779]  And so that's the road they want to go down.
[01:33:46.799 --> 01:33:50.381]  But I'm going to stop ranting, Owen Schroer co-hosting, jump in any time you want.
[01:33:51.021 --> 01:33:56.905]  Magnus, give us your view on what the Boogaloos really are and what you guys just did and what just unfolded.
[01:33:58.186 --> 01:33:59.607]  Activate the Boogaloos!
[01:34:01.367 --> 01:34:08.130]  Yeah, we're just kind of a libertarian anarchist coalition, kind of a militia, more of a movement.
[01:34:09.031 --> 01:34:23.697]  We started off in the lockdowns, then we expanded throughout the whole George Floyd and all the BLM events, and we just continue to be operating on the ground as kind of a more unifying, not right or left armed movement.
[01:34:26.152 --> 01:34:27.473]  Well, I kind of like that, actually.
[01:34:27.493 --> 01:34:31.595]  I want to get the left involved and liberals deprogrammed and into owning guns and self-defense.
[01:34:32.015 --> 01:34:35.977]  So give us the positive view of the Boogaloos versus what we hear in the media.
[01:34:37.168 --> 01:34:41.050]  Oh yeah, the positive view is that we've shown up to every kind of event.
[01:34:41.130 --> 01:34:44.091]  We've always advocated against offensive violence.
[01:34:44.131 --> 01:34:46.492]  We've always advocated against pointless riots.
[01:34:46.512 --> 01:35:03.360]  And we've always advocated for defensive action and opposing both parties, opposing police crackdowns, opposing infiltration by the police pretending to be protesters or pretending to be part of these groups and attempting to agitate and cause violence to slander their name.
[01:35:03.380 --> 01:35:05.761]  But that's what we've been, you know, from the very beginning.
[01:35:07.694 --> 01:35:13.596]  Well, I had Mike on yesterday, and I gotta say, I thought he was probably a Fed or some Harvey Lawson, or I didn't have proof of that.
[01:35:13.636 --> 01:35:17.737]  I just, a lot of these groups get led by those, but I didn't get that sense actually having him on.
[01:35:17.757 --> 01:35:28.700]  I got the sense he really believes in what he's doing, and maybe I've been, I'm not saying Boogaloo's are perfect, as any big organization can get infiltrated, but that maybe you guys overall do have a good goal.
[01:35:29.100 --> 01:35:31.261]  My concern is, are you guys accelerationists?
[01:35:31.301 --> 01:35:32.141]  Do you want a revolution?
[01:35:33.277 --> 01:35:38.281]  I mean, we view not only that a revolution is inevitable, but yes, we want a revolution.
[01:35:38.441 --> 01:35:40.423]  It just depends on what form that takes.
[01:35:40.583 --> 01:35:48.390]  We want it to be the most peaceful people's revolution as humanly possible, but we're also not ignorant to the idea that the establishment's going to go after that.
[01:35:48.430 --> 01:35:52.153]  They're going to try to destroy it, and they'll probably go on the offensive against us.
[01:35:52.594 --> 01:35:54.055]  And we're already seeing that with plenty of
[01:35:54.455 --> 01:36:10.662]  You know, activist leaders getting arrested, of plenty of us getting arrested, of, you know, the John Brennan or whatever, while he was talking about the Proud Boys and going after them, secretly snuck in Antifa around the back of that and are starting to go after them too, so the hammer's coming down on everybody.
[01:36:11.122 --> 01:36:15.584]  So we believe the revolution is already happening, it's just in the early phases of it.
[01:36:15.644 --> 01:36:19.006]  We're kind of already in our own version of the troubles that went on over in England.
[01:36:20.942 --> 01:36:22.226]  I think, well yeah, talk about the troubles.
[01:36:22.286 --> 01:36:28.583]  Remind people that don't know that really our revolution here in 1776 was an extension of the revolution in Britain.
[01:36:29.676 --> 01:36:38.759]  Yeah, so the Troubles were just this kind of secretarian, soft civil war, insurgent civil war over in Ireland for Irish independence.
[01:36:38.959 --> 01:36:41.680]  And it went on for years and years and years and decades.
[01:36:42.140 --> 01:36:51.984]  And it was marked by riots, by clashes with the police, by military and police officers being shot, by car bombs, which we've already had one of those in Nashville.
[01:36:52.524 --> 01:37:02.790]  So, like, when people talk about, like, oh, you know, this whole idea of a civil war happening is so crazy and that there's no revolution going on and anyone talking about that is mad, like, we're already in that right now.
[01:37:02.870 --> 01:37:08.693]  People are already... Sure, when you talk about the Troubles, you're talking about the more recent, in the 50s and 60s and 70s, the Irish Troubles.
[01:37:08.993 --> 01:37:16.698]  They had other Troubles and huge revolutions that would build slow and then explode over and over again in the last 900 years in England.
[01:37:17.398 --> 01:37:20.300]  And then our revolution in 1776 was an extension of that.
[01:37:21.468 --> 01:37:30.855]  Yes, and that's exactly kind of what's already going on, and the establishment right now is trying to get everyone to fight and kill each other instead of coming together against them.
[01:37:31.016 --> 01:37:43.786]  They want all of these groups, they want Antifa, they want three percenters, they want all of these groups to think the other side is the most evil thing in the world and is, you know, secretly attempting to destroy them so they can laugh all the way to the bank while we fight and kill each other.
[01:37:44.186 --> 01:37:45.167]  And that's what we don't want.
[01:37:45.547 --> 01:37:49.770]  Well, there's no doubt that's going on, but I mean, take Antifa says the local police are the enemy.
[01:37:49.830 --> 01:37:50.551]  I mean, do you think that?
[01:37:52.150 --> 01:37:55.351]  At this point, I find it hard to believe that the local police aren't the enemy.
[01:37:55.451 --> 01:38:00.953]  Like, when you look at gun confiscation, a lot of local police are just going along with that and not saying anything.
[01:38:00.993 --> 01:38:11.396]  When you look at lockdowns, when you look at arresting people over pot, when you look at busting protests, whether they be right-wing or left-wing protests, very aggressively and laughing about it.
[01:38:11.956 --> 01:38:17.738]  You know, obviously I'm not saying that Officer Friendly in a small town that's never done anything wrong is some horrible individual.
[01:38:18.059 --> 01:38:23.741]  But when you look at the institution of policing across the entire country, they've forsaken liberty in all directions.
[01:38:23.781 --> 01:38:25.421]  They've screwed over the right and left.
[01:38:25.521 --> 01:38:34.025]  They've crushed down on any form of populist uprising or populist belief in any one of our freedoms for the last 20 years, and it's only getting worse.
[01:38:35.216 --> 01:38:44.385]  Well since you raised the troubles in Ireland after World War II and then right through until today really with Sinn Féin and then of course the IRA, I mean it came out.
[01:38:44.405 --> 01:38:46.647]  I interviewed Steak Knife about a month before they killed him.
[01:38:46.687 --> 01:38:47.888]  I didn't know how important the interview was.
[01:38:47.908 --> 01:38:50.150]  Man, I've interviewed so many people that get killed after they come on.
[01:38:50.170 --> 01:38:51.992]  DC Madden, the list goes on and on.
[01:38:52.873 --> 01:38:53.053]  I think?
[01:39:16.266 --> 01:39:30.954]  Yeah, we're perfectly aware of that, which is one of the main reasons and like kind of the coalition that we have with Antifa is based off of is we know the government is going to try to infiltrate every one of these groups and have them do horrible things to justify our further police state.
[01:39:31.374 --> 01:39:34.876]  And we came together and the whole foundation of our relationship was like, hey,
[01:39:35.816 --> 01:39:38.918]  I'm not at this event, but this guy wearing a Hawaiian shirt is at this event.
[01:39:38.978 --> 01:39:39.599]  Do you know him?
[01:39:39.779 --> 01:39:40.559]  And we'll be like, no.
[01:39:40.659 --> 01:39:41.920]  We have no idea who that guy is.
[01:39:42.020 --> 01:39:42.921]  We've never seen him before.
[01:39:43.061 --> 01:39:43.761]  Keep an eye on him.
[01:39:44.062 --> 01:39:45.302]  And we would do the same thing for them.
[01:39:45.382 --> 01:39:47.284]  Like, hey, some guy showed up in all black.
[01:39:47.324 --> 01:39:48.324]  He's saying he's Antifa.
[01:39:48.344 --> 01:39:49.265]  He's trying to start fights.
[01:39:49.665 --> 01:39:50.326]  Do you know him?
[01:39:50.466 --> 01:39:52.187]  And they'll be like, no, that's not one of our guys.
[01:39:52.587 --> 01:40:01.873]  And through working together in that relationship and through not being antagonistic with anyone, we've discovered infiltrators and people that are trying to push, like, you know,
[01:40:02.677 --> 01:40:10.141]  Inefficient and inappropriate accelerationism that causes nothing but harm to the average person and gives the police state an excuse to crack down on everyone.
[01:40:12.443 --> 01:40:16.585]  Well, let's come back and Owen Schroer riding shotgun has some questions as well here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:40:16.605 --> 01:40:23.329]  But I want to ask you about in a revolution and what your goals would be of that revolution or that new Declaration of Independence.
[01:40:23.509 --> 01:40:29.373]  And my concern is I never see people protesting big tech or I mean Apple runs slave factories in China.
[01:40:29.893 --> 01:40:31.454]  And I'm not saying blow up Apple.
[01:40:32.115 --> 01:40:32.815]  I don't want that.
[01:40:33.116 --> 01:40:36.578]  But I mean, if Uyghurs bombed Apple, they would have a real argument.
[01:40:36.698 --> 01:40:38.099]  Apple runs the main slave camps.
[01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:41.742]  So if Uyghurs attacked Apple, they would have a legitimate argument at the U.N.
[01:40:41.782 --> 01:40:42.923]  Hague that we're under attack.
[01:40:42.963 --> 01:40:44.124]  We were attacking who was attacking us.
[01:40:44.324 --> 01:40:45.085]  I'm not saying do that.
[01:40:45.445 --> 01:40:50.429]  I'm just saying all the targets, I heard the local police, that sounds like a communist takeover of local government.
[01:40:50.749 --> 01:40:51.750]  I'm not saying you're doing that.
[01:40:51.770 --> 01:40:52.571]  That's what I'm concerned about.
[01:40:52.851 --> 01:40:53.551]  Stay right there, sir.
[01:40:53.591 --> 01:40:54.532]  We'll come right back to you.
[01:40:54.932 --> 01:40:56.834]  Owen Schroeder's got some things to say as well.
[01:40:57.374 --> 01:40:59.336]  And again, we'll give out your Twitter account.
[01:41:00.196 --> 01:41:03.077]  And again, I'm not saying that's evidence you're a bad person, but you're still on Twitter.
[01:41:03.397 --> 01:41:04.578]  I'm wondering how you're doing that.
[01:41:05.298 --> 01:41:09.119]  We've got at Magnus P-A-N-V-I-D-Y-A.
[01:41:09.559 --> 01:41:10.140]  We'll be right back.
[01:41:10.660 --> 01:41:11.360]  We have our own website.
[01:41:11.380 --> 01:41:12.720]  It's called Infowars.com.
[01:41:12.760 --> 01:41:14.141]  Only way dog hunts, you share link.
[01:41:14.741 --> 01:41:17.342]  So, Magnus Panvidia is our guest.
[01:41:17.362 --> 01:41:19.603]  He's one of the more prominent Boogaloo Boys.
[01:41:19.643 --> 01:41:23.804]  We had Mr. Dunn on yesterday, and I really thought about it after the interview.
[01:41:23.824 --> 01:41:24.985]  I thought, I don't think that guy's a fed.
[01:41:25.005 --> 01:41:28.986]  I think he's really pissed off about what's happening in the world and trying to unify everybody.
[01:41:30.461 --> 01:41:30.621]  Are you
[01:41:48.837 --> 01:41:54.139]  You know, teachers that formed a new Declaration of Independence and announced that the globalists have taken over.
[01:41:54.199 --> 01:41:55.100]  It's a corporate takeover.
[01:41:55.160 --> 01:41:55.900]  It's illegitimate.
[01:41:56.240 --> 01:41:57.461]  The Great Reset's illegal.
[01:41:58.361 --> 01:42:00.462]  And so we reform our new union.
[01:42:00.502 --> 01:42:01.363]  I mean, we have that right.
[01:42:02.243 --> 01:42:06.685]  I just see what happened at the Capitol, which the Boogaloos bragged about being part of.
[01:42:06.925 --> 01:42:08.266]  People can try to walk that back, whatever.
[01:42:08.506 --> 01:42:09.186]  It was idiocy.
[01:42:09.506 --> 01:42:10.507]  I wouldn't call it an assault.
[01:42:10.547 --> 01:42:12.948]  I would call it a pissing contest.
[01:42:12.988 --> 01:42:17.270]  I would call it, you know, like a... I mean, it was a little bit more intense than kind of like the
[01:42:18.962 --> 01:42:21.229]  Other than them killing four citizens in a combat with a heart attack.
[01:42:21.691 --> 01:42:22.614]  A little more intense.
[01:42:23.598 --> 01:42:27.040]  Than what you see in movies like Animal House.
[01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:30.521]  I mean, you know, Animal House pranks are now like terrorism.
[01:42:31.041 --> 01:42:32.162]  Walking off with lecterns.
[01:42:32.602 --> 01:42:33.943]  One cop got squashed in the door.
[01:42:33.963 --> 01:42:35.283]  There was some nastiness, some fights.
[01:42:35.723 --> 01:42:36.264]  It was wrong.
[01:42:37.004 --> 01:42:38.505]  But not a new Pearl Harbor.
[01:42:38.525 --> 01:42:41.066]  So, Magnus, how do you navigate this?
[01:42:41.086 --> 01:42:46.788]  I mean, you say you know that they want a pretext to clamp down on people, but then you're thinking there's a revolution.
[01:42:46.828 --> 01:42:49.750]  What's... I know the Boogaloo is a loose-knit thing.
[01:42:49.790 --> 01:42:50.930]  It's only a year old or less.
[01:42:51.350 --> 01:42:52.151]  It's getting pretty big.
[01:42:52.912 --> 01:42:54.341]  But I mean, what's attractive about it?
[01:42:54.401 --> 01:42:55.387]  What is the revolution?
[01:42:55.629 --> 01:42:56.494]  What's the goal here?
[01:42:58.058 --> 01:43:03.983]  Oh definitely, like us across the board, we just want really simple goals universally.
[01:43:04.123 --> 01:43:17.735]  Obviously everyone has their own idea underneath that, but just getting into a libertarian state of just no more foreign wars, no more corporate capture of our government, no more drug war, no more, you know, mass surveillance state.
[01:43:17.795 --> 01:43:24.902]  Same things you've talked about your entire career, you know, very basic things that need to go, and we don't believe at this point that we could
[01:43:25.342 --> 01:43:29.487]  Vote our way out of it or, you know, advocate our way out of it.
[01:43:29.688 --> 01:43:34.694]  I do not believe that violent revolution is the only path to go towards it.
[01:43:34.754 --> 01:43:37.457]  You can see things like what's going on with Wall Street bets right now.
[01:43:37.857 --> 01:43:42.163]  There's many avenues to do that, but we can no longer just vote our way out of this problem.
[01:43:43.902 --> 01:43:48.463]  Well, there's no doubt that we're under a globalist, Great Reset, anti-human revolution.
[01:43:48.503 --> 01:43:54.245]  I mean, they're involved in an offensive revolution against what was left of institutions that had some checks and balances.
[01:43:54.265 --> 01:43:57.606]  There's no doubt that the old remnants of the Republic are being swept away.
[01:43:58.887 --> 01:43:59.407]  Absolutely.
[01:43:59.467 --> 01:44:04.088]  You know, and like, I wanted to bring it up, you mentioned before, you don't know how we have a Twitter account.
[01:44:04.128 --> 01:44:05.409]  That's my third Twitter account.
[01:44:05.609 --> 01:44:06.989]  Like, I'm not allowed on Facebook.
[01:44:07.029 --> 01:44:08.570]  I had like eight different Facebook accounts.
[01:44:08.610 --> 01:44:09.590]  I can't even make them anymore.
[01:44:09.670 --> 01:44:10.410]  I was banned on PayPal.
[01:44:10.430 --> 01:44:12.631]  I'm not trying to say that that's evidence that you're bad.
[01:44:13.796 --> 01:44:16.998]  No, I'm just letting people know of the amount of censorship our movements had.
[01:44:17.098 --> 01:44:23.281]  They've purged us off of every platform, including free speech platforms like Keybase, like Telegram.
[01:44:23.581 --> 01:44:24.642]  They've kicked us off of that.
[01:44:25.062 --> 01:44:34.827]  And even before I even went on Jimmy Dore, the only podcast I could even get on was a podcast called Liberty Lockdown, which was a small, decentralized podcast that they didn't have the ability to censor.
[01:44:34.907 --> 01:44:35.788]  Yeah, let's talk about that.
[01:44:35.848 --> 01:44:37.849]  That was a great interview you did with Jimmy Dore.
[01:44:39.116 --> 01:44:59.447]  Yeah, and I'm so happy for him to have me come on because what it's given me the ability to do is to break through all the mainstream media lies about us because there's extremist experts and journalists that have covered us all year long and have buckets and piles of video and text evidence showing what our movement's about and it doesn't line up with what the mainstream media has all.
[01:44:59.867 --> 01:45:04.310]  And they'll directly quote these extremist experts that work for DC
[01:45:04.970 --> 01:45:06.551]  And I feel the same thing's been done to Antifa.
[01:45:06.631 --> 01:45:08.612]  I feel the same thing's been done to 3%ers.
[01:45:08.632 --> 01:45:11.053]  I feel like the same thing's been done to BLM.
[01:45:22.498 --> 01:45:23.959]  It's just coming from different directions.
[01:45:23.999 --> 01:45:26.420]  But they all want us to be disunity.
[01:45:26.460 --> 01:45:27.400]  They want disorder.
[01:45:27.460 --> 01:45:28.061]  They want internal conflict.
[01:45:28.081 --> 01:45:28.721]  Sure, but there's no doubt.
[01:45:28.801 --> 01:45:30.322]  I mean, you believe in free speech.
[01:45:30.482 --> 01:45:31.302]  Antifa doesn't.
[01:45:31.662 --> 01:45:33.383]  It's funded by Soros, on record.
[01:45:33.743 --> 01:45:35.764]  I mean, you have Antifa members that...
[01:45:37.389 --> 01:45:41.931]  That's the thing is like, yeah, there might be infiltrated parts of it, but that's the same for everything.
[01:45:41.971 --> 01:45:42.952]  That's something you talked about.
[01:45:43.032 --> 01:45:58.900]  And like when I go back to like your early works about the WTO riots and how the police infiltrated the WTO riots to cause chaos and false flag, some of those same people that were at those WTO riots in Seattle are the same people that I talk to today that are part of Antifa.
[01:45:59.201 --> 01:46:03.383]  And they get really disillusioned when they hear things about like, oh, all of Antifa is Soros funded.
[01:46:03.963 --> 01:46:05.424]  A lot of them talk just like you.
[01:46:05.484 --> 01:46:06.345]  They hate the Fed.
[01:46:06.465 --> 01:46:08.626]  They hate global, you know, corporations.
[01:46:08.686 --> 01:46:09.947]  They stand for free speech.
[01:46:10.047 --> 01:46:16.071]  But Fox News or something will put the camera on one guy that has a stupid opinion and be like, oh, they speak for all of Antifa.
[01:46:16.091 --> 01:46:21.075]  When it's a global... No, I will invite any of those Antifa on that will actually talk to us.
[01:46:21.115 --> 01:46:22.636]  I'd love to actually hear that if that exists.
[01:46:23.216 --> 01:46:25.898]  Let's bring Owen Schroeder in here, patiently sitting there in the news center.
[01:46:26.318 --> 01:46:27.499]  Owen, what's your take on this fellow?
[01:46:29.497 --> 01:46:38.402]  Well, I think it's just a matter of everybody has the same goals and just kind of having that realization and unifying moment.
[01:46:38.442 --> 01:46:46.067]  I mean, there's all the claptrap and the false flags and the distractions, but what Magnus was saying earlier, I think we all agree with.
[01:46:46.107 --> 01:46:48.108]  I mean, I'm against the war on drugs.
[01:46:49.189 --> 01:46:52.771]  I think that that is part of the problem, and when I try to talk to BLM people,
[01:46:53.391 --> 01:46:56.313]  I say, hey, look, you know, why don't we have law reform?
[01:46:56.373 --> 01:46:59.594]  I mean, forget about, I mean, at this point, just go ahead and defund all the police.
[01:46:59.794 --> 01:47:01.655]  You'll see who that actually works out for.
[01:47:02.075 --> 01:47:05.317]  So whatever, defund all the police, see how that works out for you, fine.
[01:47:05.817 --> 01:47:07.858]  But it's about law reform.
[01:47:07.938 --> 01:47:17.784]  Most of these interactions that they complain about are somehow derivative from a drug situation, or they have a past criminal record from drug conventions.
[01:47:17.804 --> 01:47:20.385]  So you get rid of all of that, all of a sudden you have
[01:47:20.825 --> 01:47:25.088]  Half the interactions between police and people cut, I mean just gone.
[01:47:25.369 --> 01:47:27.010]  So you're immediately going to have less violent interactions.
[01:47:27.030 --> 01:47:29.012]  Well I agree, it's not the police that are the issue, it's the laws.
[01:47:29.392 --> 01:47:30.713]  So, but it's just one of the things.
[01:47:30.733 --> 01:47:35.317]  So yeah, law reform, it's time for us in this, I'm saying we got about three months to do this.
[01:47:35.477 --> 01:47:37.779]  I believe we have about three months to unify the people.
[01:47:38.359 --> 01:47:45.664]  Before whatever this Biden administration has planned for us, big tech has planned for us, big medical has planned for us, the big banks have planned for us with this Great Reset.
[01:47:45.904 --> 01:47:51.948]  I think we've got about three months to unify the people on common goals, common agendas, and it's common sense stuff.
[01:47:52.368 --> 01:47:52.888]  It's common sense stuff.
[01:47:52.908 --> 01:47:53.329]  I agree with you.
[01:47:53.409 --> 01:47:55.870]  We should be able to unify everybody against the Great Reset.
[01:47:55.890 --> 01:48:03.395]  It is literally a corporate takeover to consolidate power under the name of environmentalism to literally bankrupt everyone and have a universal income.
[01:48:03.655 --> 01:48:05.580]  So they can dictate the terms of our surrender.
[01:48:05.620 --> 01:48:08.727]  We have got to get everybody mobilized against the Great Reset.
[01:48:09.067 --> 01:48:11.212]  What is your view, Magnus, about the Great Reset?
[01:48:12.239 --> 01:48:17.103]  Oh yeah, and I agree, and it's funny enough because I had this conversation with an Antifa member.
[01:48:17.203 --> 01:48:17.903]  They agree too.
[01:48:18.003 --> 01:48:29.612]  It's not that they're against the idea of like, oh, let's reset the system everywhere, but they are perfectly aware of the people that are pushing that idea, of how all these multinational billion-dollar banks and everything, it's not a great reset for the people.
[01:48:29.652 --> 01:48:30.333]  Oh yeah, I'd love a reset.
[01:48:30.353 --> 01:48:31.514]  Exactly, we need a reset.
[01:48:31.574 --> 01:48:32.334]  We need a reset.
[01:48:32.354 --> 01:48:36.217]  I'm going to hold you over, but we need a reset, but it's not this reset.
[01:48:36.578 --> 01:48:37.578]  This is a horrible reset.
[01:48:37.598 --> 01:48:37.999]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:48:38.848 --> 01:48:39.468]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:48:39.508 --> 01:48:46.012]  And a lot of people on the left are very, very aware of the type of people that are pushing that, and they don't like it either.
[01:48:46.332 --> 01:48:47.713]  But you don't hear those voices.
[01:48:47.753 --> 01:48:48.553]  You don't hear them.
[01:48:48.613 --> 01:48:51.995]  You only hear the Bidenites and, you know, the authoritarian left people.
[01:48:52.376 --> 01:48:58.139]  When you actually go on the ground, which I think is important for a lot of people, and non-hostily talk to a lot of these people,
[01:48:58.559 --> 01:49:04.204]  You'll sit there and you'll be like, oh wait, you hate, you know, billion dollar corporations trying to take over the world through some globalistic intent?
[01:49:04.484 --> 01:49:04.965]  Me too.
[01:49:05.285 --> 01:49:05.946]  Oh, you hate this?
[01:49:06.146 --> 01:49:06.506]  Me too.
[01:49:06.566 --> 01:49:09.369]  And we get, we come together more on a common ground through that.
[01:49:09.569 --> 01:49:18.757]  Whether it be libertarian, whether it be left, whether it be, you know, Black Panthers people that I've had great conversations with that on any other day would sound like you on a lot of subjects.
[01:49:18.797 --> 01:49:23.062]  Yeah, I mean, I remember I had a conversation with some BLM people and they were trying to block me out.
[01:49:23.082 --> 01:49:25.464]  It was actually white liberals were getting aggressive with me.
[01:49:25.745 --> 01:49:27.186]  And then I just stopped and I said, OK.
[01:49:27.386 --> 01:49:28.928]  And I gave like a five minute speech.
[01:49:29.349 --> 01:49:34.654]  And then the BLM leaders that were there were kind of like, damn, like, that's exactly what we believe, huh?
[01:49:34.694 --> 01:49:35.836]  Maybe this guy isn't so bad.
[01:49:36.717 --> 01:49:37.698]  All right, we'll be right back.
[01:49:38.772 --> 01:49:39.512]  Stay there, both of you.
[01:49:39.532 --> 01:49:40.633]  This is a powerful interview.
[01:49:40.673 --> 01:49:41.093]  Stay with us.
[01:49:41.113 --> 01:49:41.673]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:41.753 --> 01:49:44.414]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com, Tomorrow's News Today.
[01:49:44.674 --> 01:49:45.934]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:49:46.634 --> 01:49:48.255]  Magnus Panvidia is our guest.
[01:49:48.275 --> 01:49:56.917]  I want to invite him back up next week or so if he can do it for a full hour to really flesh all this out, get some of his ideas, because it's important to talk to all the different factions and groups and organizations.
[01:49:57.417 --> 01:49:59.358]  He's one of the most prominent people in the Boogaloo.
[01:50:03.155 --> 01:50:12.258]  I'm glad we're getting him on and finding out what they actually stand for versus some of the things that have been out there and some of the things I've said as well, which I think clearly they are accelerationists.
[01:50:12.278 --> 01:50:13.218]  They do want a revolution.
[01:50:13.958 --> 01:50:16.619]  And it's in the Declaration of Independence that you can have a revolution if you want one.
[01:50:17.099 --> 01:50:18.139]  The question is, will you win it?
[01:50:18.439 --> 01:50:19.480]  And then you write the history books.
[01:50:20.020 --> 01:50:21.600]  And we're under globalist takeover.
[01:50:21.720 --> 01:50:25.421]  And so the argument is, yeah, we have a right to this, but what are the targets?
[01:50:28.055 --> 01:50:34.238]  I'd rather have the states' coalitions, people like Rand Paul and others, organize and expose the Great Reset and back all this off.
[01:50:34.778 --> 01:50:36.119]  The globalists think they can get away with this.
[01:50:36.139 --> 01:50:43.262]  They're going full steam ahead with all of this, and it's very, very destructive.
[01:50:43.302 --> 01:50:46.203]  And so I just can't sit here and take all these attacks.
[01:50:46.823 --> 01:50:47.604]  Again, I'll say it.
[01:50:47.744 --> 01:50:51.906]  Apple's the biggest user of slave labor of Uyghurs, 3 million of them in death camps.
[01:50:52.306 --> 01:50:53.086]  They don't even deny that.
[01:50:53.146 --> 01:50:54.307]  Even mainstream news admits that.
[01:50:55.670 --> 01:50:59.154]  Big Tech's coming with forced inoculations, global IDs.
[01:50:59.554 --> 01:51:00.435]  This is an assault!
[01:51:01.396 --> 01:51:05.059]  But, acting like a bunch of idiots taking selfies in the Capitol is not the way to do it.
[01:51:05.560 --> 01:51:10.905]  I'm trying to get the governors and good people in government to say, this is insane, let's have a coalition and say no.
[01:51:11.465 --> 01:51:14.068]  This new world order is so authoritarian, it should be easy!
[01:51:15.014 --> 01:51:25.118]  For us to stop it, but then Big Tech comes in and blocks anybody that actually covers COVID as a fraud, global government, the Great Reset, Big Pharma's corruption, all of it.
[01:51:25.158 --> 01:51:28.879]  So, Magnus, we've got Stuart Rhodes coming up here in just a moment, founder of O'Keepers.
[01:51:29.240 --> 01:51:30.060]  I appreciate your time.
[01:51:30.080 --> 01:51:32.541]  I want to give you a few minutes to make any other closing comments.
[01:51:33.948 --> 01:51:40.759]  Oh yeah, and actually I was just on the phone with the woman that was at the WTO riots and she said she would be willing to come on and talk to you.
[01:51:40.879 --> 01:51:44.404]  So, if you want to talk to an Antifa member, you can talk to an Antifa member.
[01:51:44.845 --> 01:51:45.927]  Please, we would have everyone!
[01:51:46.920 --> 01:52:02.150]  And definitely, like, obviously the dictionary definition of accelerationism might be correct, but what everyone is calling us, if by the criteria that you think everything is fundamentally flawed and it will not change without radical change, then literally everyone is an accelerationist.
[01:52:02.230 --> 01:52:06.774]  Joe Biden is an accelerationist, AOC is an accelerationist, Rand Paul is an accelerationist.
[01:52:06.794 --> 01:52:11.637]  Like, if you look at the world through that view, everyone acknowledges that things are totally
[01:52:12.607 --> 01:52:15.277]  Destroyed across the board when it comes to our economics, everything.
[01:52:17.856 --> 01:52:18.256]  Exactly.
[01:52:18.336 --> 01:52:21.498]  So like a lot of people say like, oh, you want a revolution, you're an accelerationist.
[01:52:21.518 --> 01:52:23.159]  I'm like, everyone wants a revolution right now.
[01:52:23.299 --> 01:52:24.300]  Everyone's talking about it.
[01:52:24.400 --> 01:52:25.961]  It trends on Twitter constantly.
[01:52:26.001 --> 01:52:32.104]  We have, you know, hundreds of thousands of people on Reddit burning money just to take down hedge funds this moment.
[01:52:32.504 --> 01:52:34.666]  Like, that's the America we live in.
[01:52:34.706 --> 01:52:39.829]  I feel like these journalists in their New York high rises just don't realize what's going on.
[01:52:39.849 --> 01:52:43.771]  And it's the same reason why they don't like, oh, why do you show up with guns at protests?
[01:52:43.831 --> 01:52:45.752]  Because everyone at these protests has guns.
[01:52:46.092 --> 01:52:47.273]  You have Black Panthers there.
[01:52:47.293 --> 01:52:48.134]  You have Oath Keepers there.
[01:52:48.154 --> 01:52:48.794]  You have us there.
[01:52:49.114 --> 01:52:53.637]  People have been shot and killed on all sides of this disagreement at these events.
[01:52:54.297 --> 01:52:58.820]  So when they look at it, they're like, oh, we don't understand why, you know, people are armed or why there's chaos.
[01:52:58.840 --> 01:52:59.961]  It's because they're not on the ground.
[01:53:00.021 --> 01:53:09.607]  They think we live in this comfortable, nice little, you know, America and nothing's going on while the plebs and the people are going crazy on the ground.
[01:53:11.628 --> 01:53:13.109]  Well, do you remember what Kennedy said?
[01:53:15.179 --> 01:53:22.221]  Well exactly, but Kennedy had a quote, I'll butcher it, but he said, those that make peaceful change impossible make violent revolution inevitable.
[01:53:23.163 --> 01:53:32.351]  Exactly, and that's what's going on right now when they censor everybody, when they take everyone down, when they call literally every group, regardless of what size it is, as violent extremists.
[01:53:33.412 --> 01:53:34.913]  Again, what's going on with Wall Street bets?
[01:53:35.013 --> 01:53:39.817]  They found a way to take down these hedge funds, now they're talking about changing the whole market and regulating the whole market.
[01:53:40.557 --> 01:53:47.083]  Every peaceful option we push, and we need to keep trying to push peaceful options, we need to keep finding cracks in the armor to be peaceful.
[01:53:47.523 --> 01:53:51.308]  But they continue to shut those avenues down one after another after another.
[01:53:51.688 --> 01:54:02.041]  If they keep doing that, and that was my warning to them in that speech, if they keep denying people redress, keep denying people the ability to change things, then you're going to have civil conflict.
[01:54:02.481 --> 01:54:05.866]  And it's going to be really bad for them, for us, and for everyone involved.
[01:54:06.326 --> 01:54:11.188]  Okay, Magnus, come back on because I'm really impressed and I'm glad that you actually came on.
[01:54:11.568 --> 01:54:13.249]  I'd love to have you on with the Antifa lady.
[01:54:13.689 --> 01:54:14.369]  We want to have them on.
[01:54:14.390 --> 01:54:25.234]  We want to actually reach out to these folks because I understand that we can all drink the mainstream media Kool-Aid at a certain point and need to actually hear what these groups actually stand for so that the grassroots come together and then forget who's running them on top.
[01:54:25.574 --> 01:54:27.075]  What they really don't want is us to come together.
[01:54:27.095 --> 01:54:32.317]  That's why they are censoring everyone so they can create all these straw men and I make mistakes sometimes as well.
[01:54:32.637 --> 01:54:33.958]  So thank you so much for spending time with us.
[01:54:35.049 --> 01:54:38.253]  Anytime, I appreciate having me on, and yeah, we'll definitely try to get back on in the future.
[01:54:39.254 --> 01:54:39.734]  Fantastic.
[01:54:39.754 --> 01:54:43.638]  Next week if you can, and I'll ask the producers, please get this Antifa lady on.
[01:54:43.999 --> 01:54:45.400]  That's what I want, that's interesting radio.
[01:54:45.420 --> 01:54:47.502]  I try to get folks on like Tucker Carlson does.
[01:54:47.883 --> 01:54:49.765]  Okay, shifting gears.
[01:54:50.345 --> 01:54:56.552]  Stuart Rhodes is a retired constitutional lawyer, award-winning researcher, you name it.
[01:54:57.873 --> 01:54:58.734]  I don't buy any of that.
[01:55:15.384 --> 01:55:21.127]  But Oath Keepers is a big organization, and it's been able to really stop major infiltration to a certain extent.
[01:55:22.248 --> 01:55:25.549]  And Stewart is not ready to get to that yet because he doesn't know all the details.
[01:55:25.949 --> 01:55:36.595]  But just in general, Nancy Pelosi coming out, Stewart, and saying the enemy's within, members of Congress, we need permanent troops, martial law, Brennan saying arrest even libertarians.
[01:55:36.895 --> 01:55:39.396]  I mean, this is, they're really pushing for a fight.
[01:55:39.497 --> 01:55:40.697]  So I'm really concerned.
[01:55:40.717 --> 01:55:42.038]  What do you think the big picture is here?
[01:55:43.854 --> 01:55:45.496]  Well, this is a suppression campaign.
[01:55:45.516 --> 01:55:46.417]  It's a terror campaign.
[01:55:46.757 --> 01:55:55.426]  The goal is to terrorize people and make them afraid to associate and make them, you know, sit down and shut up as they take absolute power.
[01:55:55.946 --> 01:55:59.470]  And so I think we need to take a lesson from the founders and not do that.
[01:55:59.890 --> 01:56:04.455]  You know, when Gage landed in Boston Harbor and put all of Massachusetts under martial law,
[01:56:05.095 --> 01:56:12.061]  He read a decree from the king stating that all town hall meetings are now banned, and they thumbed their nose at him and said, you know, stuff it.
[01:56:12.081 --> 01:56:13.922]  We're going to hold town hall meetings anyway.
[01:56:13.942 --> 01:56:15.763]  That's what Americans need to do also.
[01:56:15.783 --> 01:56:27.613]  You need to continue to be free people, start at the bottom up, town and county, and you need to be ready to nullify and do mass non-compliance and mass refusal of anything that comes out of an illegitimate regime.
[01:56:28.113 --> 01:56:30.995]  That's the first thing is you got to be willing to say that the emperor has no clothes.
[01:56:31.455 --> 01:56:34.478]  They want to make you sit down and shut up and then compel your speech.
[01:56:35.154 --> 01:56:38.576]  Why are they following the exact path of tyrants previously?
[01:56:38.616 --> 01:56:39.376]  Is it just their instincts?
[01:56:39.396 --> 01:56:40.056]  They can't help it.
[01:56:40.076 --> 01:56:43.118]  They think big tech will save them and this time it'll be different.
[01:56:43.298 --> 01:56:45.419]  The more they squeeze, they only create more opposition.
[01:56:45.439 --> 01:56:46.939]  It's not going to go well for them.
[01:57:02.870 --> 01:57:03.270]  It's not.
[01:57:03.591 --> 01:57:13.398]  That's the thing, is they think that we are like they did in Russia or in China or in East Germany with the Stasi, that they can squeeze the people and make them sit down and shut up.
[01:57:13.758 --> 01:57:15.520]  But Americans are made from a different cloth.
[01:57:15.960 --> 01:57:21.264]  You know, we were the ones who were the rebels of the world that came here to get away from tyranny, and that's in our blood.
[01:57:22.276 --> 01:57:24.498]  So I think it's going to go very radically different for them.
[01:57:25.419 --> 01:57:31.264]  But you know, you can tell them all day long, like your prior guest did, that they're heading down a bad road.
[01:57:31.284 --> 01:57:33.366]  It's going to be bad for everybody, but they're not going to listen.
[01:57:34.106 --> 01:57:36.088]  But I think we are on the Founders' path.
[01:57:36.128 --> 01:57:39.331]  We need to understand that and do the same things they did.
[01:57:39.431 --> 01:57:44.275]  Learn from their example and learn from their wisdom and don't make the mistakes others made around the world.
[01:57:44.756 --> 01:57:46.057]  Make sure you do what the Founders did.
[01:57:46.317 --> 01:57:47.098]  They came together.
[01:57:47.558 --> 01:57:54.122]  They were united at the town and county level for mutual defense and also for grassroots politics.
[01:57:54.522 --> 01:57:58.705]  They separated themselves from an illegitimate regime even before they declared independence.
[01:57:59.085 --> 01:58:01.106]  You know, they didn't listen to the real governors.
[01:58:01.286 --> 01:58:08.691]  They smuggled and went around all the edicts of the king and they wore homespun clothing, stopped buying textiles from England.
[01:58:08.711 --> 01:58:11.032]  And that's like moonshine.
[01:58:11.473 --> 01:58:12.833]  All of this is pure Americana.
[01:58:13.314 --> 01:58:13.614]  I agree.
[01:58:13.694 --> 01:58:15.595]  Everybody, they're trying to drive us underground.
[01:58:15.635 --> 01:58:16.916]  Let's jump in that briar patch.
[01:58:17.256 --> 01:58:19.637]  Let's just stop supporting them in any way.
[01:58:21.318 --> 01:58:22.959]  Right, and you have to be united together.
[01:58:23.499 --> 01:58:31.484]  They want you to hide, they want you to be afraid that your neighbor is a snitch, that everyone's a snitch, and you should just stay in your house and hope that no one comes to you.
[01:58:31.864 --> 01:58:34.185]  But like Solson Neeson said, that's a mistake.
[01:58:34.565 --> 01:58:40.749]  And they realized that in the Gulag's act of the fact that the way to answer this, the way to answer the secret police doing
[01:58:41.689 --> 01:58:45.430]  ...terrorizing the population was to come together in mutual defense.
[01:58:45.811 --> 01:58:48.131]  That's what we need to do as Americans, is stand up.
[01:58:48.531 --> 01:58:52.193]  You know, you need to go to your sheriff, and if you've got a good sheriff, you need to raise a posse.
[01:58:52.453 --> 01:58:54.273]  If you won't do that, you need a new sheriff.
[01:58:54.633 --> 01:58:59.075]  You need to start local and get as strong as you can be all together in a local community.
[01:59:00.794 --> 01:59:02.935]  Well, there's no doubt this is a wake-up call to everybody.
[01:59:02.955 --> 01:59:04.997]  They now know that you weren't joking, I wasn't joking.
[01:59:05.317 --> 01:59:06.778]  We are now inside the New World Order.
[01:59:06.798 --> 01:59:07.138]  The U.S.
[01:59:07.198 --> 01:59:08.359]  is now an occupied country.
[01:59:08.739 --> 01:59:10.881]  It should be pretty easy to defeat the globalists if we get the word out.
[01:59:11.161 --> 01:59:13.623]  Well, they're right back with Stuart Rhodes, Owen Schroer and more.
[01:59:13.683 --> 01:59:14.383]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:59:15.404 --> 01:59:16.685]  America!
[01:59:17.325 --> 01:59:18.046]  America!
[01:59:19.807 --> 01:59:21.108]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:59:21.128 --> 01:59:24.010]  Stuart Rhodes, founder of the Oath Keepers, is here with us.
[01:59:25.140 --> 01:59:28.423]  And he just learned about this in the last 12 hours or so.
[01:59:28.483 --> 01:59:33.046]  Well, they sure didn't bring the weapons and they sure didn't do all the things they supposedly were planning to do.
[01:59:42.648 --> 01:59:48.294]  It was the Q phenomenon behind the scenes that, oh, secretly Trump's giving orders to storm D.C.
[01:59:48.314 --> 01:59:55.340]  and all this, and then it would piggyback on us having peaceful demonstrations calling for a Senate investigation that Ted Cruz was calling for.
[01:59:55.741 --> 01:59:57.563]  And then you get to demonize the entire Trump
[01:59:58.573 --> 02:00:01.294]  So they need this lie to continue.
[02:00:01.314 --> 02:00:03.214]  Remember first they said Trump incited it.
[02:00:03.234 --> 02:00:04.174]  He caused it.
[02:00:04.194 --> 02:00:04.935]  He's got a trial coming up.
[02:00:24.923 --> 02:00:25.503]  February 8th.
[02:00:26.204 --> 02:00:28.585]  Then they had to back off and go, oh wait, actually it's coordinated.
[02:00:29.465 --> 02:00:30.086]  It's coordinated.
[02:00:30.106 --> 02:00:32.227]  And I'll just tell you, I was there once it started.
[02:00:32.687 --> 02:00:33.628]  I saw it was coordinated.
[02:00:33.688 --> 02:00:34.308]  I saw the videos.
[02:00:34.348 --> 02:00:35.529]  I'm like, who is this?
[02:00:35.549 --> 02:00:36.509]  Who are these provocateurs?
[02:00:37.030 --> 02:00:40.992]  It was Antifa as a main group yelling, attack, attack, take it, it's ours.
[02:00:42.272 --> 02:00:46.314]  And then it was three people in each other group of these larger groups.
[02:00:46.334 --> 02:00:47.415]  So you could demonize that group.
[02:00:47.435 --> 02:00:49.636]  I mean, this was the clearest infiltration I ever saw.
[02:00:49.996 --> 02:00:52.178]  They got a few people out of hundreds of thousands, maybe 200.
[02:00:54.039 --> 02:00:55.260]  To go in behind him, that's less than 1%.
[02:00:55.780 --> 02:00:57.021]  That's what happened.
[02:00:57.221 --> 02:00:58.842]  I was there, the video all shows that.
[02:00:59.142 --> 02:01:05.486]  Now they're saying members of Congress, because they gave other Republicans tours the day before that weren't even part of going in the Capitol.
[02:01:05.726 --> 02:01:06.666]  They all have to be arrested.
[02:01:07.047 --> 02:01:07.947]  This is a purge.
[02:01:08.087 --> 02:01:08.988]  This is a big move.
[02:01:09.608 --> 02:01:22.393]  We need Senator Paul, we need Senator Cruz and others to go on the offense against this now that Pelosi this morning, Stuart Rhodes, came out and said that members of Congress are the enemy within and that members of Congress need to be arrested.
[02:01:22.753 --> 02:01:24.573]  I mean, they are going for broke here, aren't they, Stuart?
[02:01:25.934 --> 02:01:27.775]  Well, definitely, but I wanted to clarify one thing.
[02:01:27.895 --> 02:01:31.376]  Like, I did an interview last week with the Washington Post.
[02:01:32.017 --> 02:01:38.083]  And it says here, in a phone interview last week, Rhodes said Caldwell helped stop the steel protesters navigate arriving in D.C.
[02:01:38.103 --> 02:01:45.630]  for a protest in November, but that Caldwell is not a Dues Pay member of Vote Keepers and does not hold any leadership position in the organization.
[02:01:45.991 --> 02:01:51.396]  Rhodes said he did not know Caldwell to be taking any actions on January 6th on behalf of Vote Keepers.
[02:01:51.876 --> 02:01:53.958]  Rhodes said that Watkins is a member of Vote Keepers.
[02:01:54.239 --> 02:01:55.220]  That's just the facts.
[02:01:55.720 --> 02:02:02.950]  And so Jessica Watkins does have a GoFundMe set up, or not a GoFundMe, it's on RallyPay, but a fundraiser for her legal defense.
[02:02:02.970 --> 02:02:07.636]  And we do encourage people to go and defend the actual, if you remember, who was involved in that.
[02:02:08.236 --> 02:02:09.698]  So we always stand behind our people.
[02:02:09.959 --> 02:02:10.840]  So there you go.
[02:02:11.541 --> 02:02:13.784]  But again, you didn't coordinate, you weren't part of this.
[02:02:14.577 --> 02:02:15.358]  No, absolutely not.
[02:02:15.838 --> 02:02:26.248]  So, you know, and our mission there is, as we stated in our call to action to go to D.C., which we always do, protect people, protect venues, protect events, and that's it, you know, do VIP escorts.
[02:02:27.289 --> 02:02:30.271]  But, you know, they're going to demonize and use this any way they possibly can.
[02:02:30.632 --> 02:02:33.935]  And like I said, what they're doing is a massive terror campaign.
[02:02:34.375 --> 02:02:42.680]  And their goal is to get Americans to be concerned and afraid to speak out so that they'll be silenced, so they won't interfere with what they're planning to do.
[02:02:42.700 --> 02:02:50.405]  And the answer is more demonstrations, more rallies, but peacefully, and more exposing the globalists, letting them know their terror campaign isn't working.
[02:02:51.305 --> 02:02:51.546]  Right.
[02:02:52.876 --> 02:02:53.437]  Compliance.
[02:02:53.457 --> 02:02:56.300]  You've got to start doing nullification and interposition.
[02:02:56.941 --> 02:03:09.534]  As Jefferson and Madison both said, when resisting the Alien Sedition Act, it's the responsibility of the states to stand up and interpose themselves between the people and an oppressive government at the federal level.
[02:03:09.855 --> 02:03:11.717]  So the states have got to stand up, like you've been saying.
[02:03:13.306 --> 02:03:15.627]  We cannot overstate this multinational takeover.
[02:03:15.667 --> 02:03:16.528]  They've got H.R.
[02:03:16.808 --> 02:03:23.372]  1 that lets them federalize elections and have illegal aliens vote and have mail-in ballots because they know the states are willing to block that.
[02:03:24.212 --> 02:03:33.217]  They are getting rid of the borders, cutting off the energy power, setting up domestic forces, saying they're going to go after, quote, libertarian networks with the CIA and Pentagon and disrupt them.
[02:03:33.237 --> 02:03:35.058]  These are quotes at press briefings.
[02:03:35.599 --> 02:03:38.240]  I mean, this is ridiculously tyrannical.
[02:03:38.520 --> 02:03:41.562]  I mean, this is like China even tries to hide some of the stuff they do.
[02:03:41.882 --> 02:03:42.463]  This is like
[02:03:43.266 --> 02:03:49.554]  The biggest red flag cartoon level tyranny I've ever heard they're trying to launch.
[02:03:49.574 --> 02:03:50.496]  I mean, this is crazy.
[02:03:52.602 --> 02:04:08.786]  I'm glad they're doing that because they're taking the mask off, we're seeing exactly who the traitors are, we're seeing the deep state on both sides of the aisle, those Republicans and Democrats, and the people are now finally realizing that, like you said, we've been right all these years, it is the oligarchs at the very top versus the people.
[02:04:08.826 --> 02:04:13.927]  In fact, the Occupy Wall Street people were correct about who owns this country and who runs it.
[02:04:14.207 --> 02:04:19.128]  It is that 1% of the super wealthy at the very top who got it through ill-gotten gains
[02:04:19.709 --> 02:04:21.393]  They're only wrong about the solutions.
[02:04:21.654 --> 02:04:25.203]  Communism is a horrible solution from the frying pan to the fire.
[02:04:25.564 --> 02:04:27.189]  But I do think it's important that we
[02:04:27.964 --> 02:04:31.026]  I see people on the left waking up and realizing they were duped.
[02:04:31.286 --> 02:04:32.306]  I mean, look at Biden.
[02:04:32.366 --> 02:04:37.609]  He is the guy who put more black males in prison than anybody else in the United States.
[02:04:37.829 --> 02:04:39.590]  Because with his legislation, it led to that.
[02:04:39.950 --> 02:04:41.111]  And so they're starting to wake up.
[02:04:41.131 --> 02:04:49.675]  We've got black patriots and Oath Keepers that are now reaching out to black patriots in other groups across the country who are starting to say, OK, we've got to come together.
[02:04:49.775 --> 02:04:55.358]  Whether you're black, Hispanic, white, as long as you believe in freedom, we've got to come together and unite against these all of them.
[02:04:55.418 --> 02:05:01.783]  That's why the system is doing this great reset, this clampdown, because they know worldwide there's been a global political realignment.
[02:05:01.903 --> 02:05:09.088]  I mean, three years ago they were in the Financial Times of London admitting, oh my God, there's a realignment, everyone hates us, what do we do?
[02:05:09.148 --> 02:05:09.989]  Well, now we see it.
[02:05:10.089 --> 02:05:11.230]  It's global martial law.
[02:05:13.095 --> 02:05:14.698]  Right, but it's too late.
[02:05:15.258 --> 02:05:22.169]  There are millions now across the world who are red-pilled, and they have not been able to stop you and other dissident voices, and they can't stop us.
[02:05:22.569 --> 02:05:25.954]  And so we have to just realize that the one thing we can do to help
[02:05:28.087 --> 02:05:29.988]  It's to shut up and sit down.
[02:05:30.309 --> 02:05:31.209]  So you can't do that.
[02:05:31.489 --> 02:05:35.172]  Of course, be smart about what you say, because everything you say can and will be used against you.
[02:05:35.452 --> 02:05:39.895]  Anytime you get angry in a chat and say something, it'll be used against you and whoever you're associated with.
[02:05:40.215 --> 02:05:42.337]  So be smart, but stop.
[02:05:42.817 --> 02:05:44.638]  Don't let them stop you from speaking out.
[02:05:44.959 --> 02:05:46.299]  And you've got to focus on local.
[02:05:46.600 --> 02:05:50.042]  You've got to take back your towns and counties, and you've got to insist on paper ballots.
[02:05:50.322 --> 02:05:57.210]  I totally agree with you and now they're trying to say any questioning of that is wrong.
[02:05:57.310 --> 02:05:59.612]  Owen, your points with Stuart Rhodes.
[02:05:59.953 --> 02:06:05.639]  They're obviously trying to set up his organization because it's been so peaceful and done a great job educating millions of military and law enforcement.
[02:06:06.510 --> 02:06:13.515]  Well again, it's interesting you have Nancy Pelosi, and I think we all know what she's talking about, but saying the enemy is within the Capitol.
[02:06:13.535 --> 02:06:15.196]  Of course, that's not considered incitement.
[02:06:15.557 --> 02:06:17.938]  But she's actually making an admission here.
[02:06:17.999 --> 02:06:18.419]  She's right.
[02:06:18.459 --> 02:06:19.700]  The enemy is inside the Capitol.
[02:06:19.740 --> 02:06:20.260]  It's Congress.
[02:06:20.520 --> 02:06:21.501]  It's Nancy Pelosi.
[02:06:21.541 --> 02:06:22.242]  It's Chuck Schumer.
[02:06:22.302 --> 02:06:29.467]  It's Maxine Waters who incited violence against Americans for four straight years, calling us Nazis, white supremacists, lying about us.
[02:06:29.487 --> 02:06:30.368]  They've been inciting
[02:06:30.908 --> 02:06:32.730]  Violence for four years.
[02:06:32.810 --> 02:06:37.695]  Now they get a taste of their own medicine and all of a sudden they're cowering behind walls, which now they said are going to be permanent.
[02:06:38.215 --> 02:06:40.177]  Permanent walls in D.C.
[02:06:40.217 --> 02:06:42.019]  now to keep the people out of the people's house.
[02:06:42.399 --> 02:06:43.801]  I thought walls didn't work.
[02:06:43.841 --> 02:06:44.982]  I thought walls were racist.
[02:06:45.102 --> 02:06:47.144]  Oh, not until it's for their benefit.
[02:06:47.164 --> 02:06:49.666]  So no, actually, I have to come back around on that, Alex.
[02:06:49.767 --> 02:06:50.087]  I agree.
[02:06:50.127 --> 02:06:50.948]  Nancy Pelosi is right.
[02:06:51.668 --> 02:06:53.069]  The enemies are within.
[02:06:53.149 --> 02:06:53.969]  The enemies are within.
[02:06:54.009 --> 02:06:54.969]  They are in Congress.
[02:06:55.550 --> 02:06:56.890]  They are the people that sold us out.
[02:06:57.250 --> 02:07:03.433]  I mean, has anybody ever done a... I'd like to see a number from, I don't know, let's just say since Nancy Pelosi's been in office.
[02:07:03.453 --> 02:07:06.074]  So about 40, 50 years or Biden's been in politics.
[02:07:06.994 --> 02:07:13.817]  How many hundreds of billions or perhaps even trillions of dollars have gone overseas to other countries?
[02:07:14.598 --> 02:07:15.878]  Okay, let's get an audit of that.
[02:07:15.938 --> 02:07:21.361]  Let's say $500 billion, a trillion dollars of our money overseas.
[02:07:21.521 --> 02:07:22.041]  Okay, fine.
[02:07:22.061 --> 02:07:22.761]  That's how much money.
[02:07:23.041 --> 02:07:24.442]  Now, let's see the receipts.
[02:07:25.002 --> 02:07:27.163]  Let's see what that money is being used for.
[02:07:27.443 --> 02:07:28.144]  Well, we already know.
[02:07:28.164 --> 02:07:30.665]  We know it goes back to the country and then it goes back to them.
[02:07:31.125 --> 02:07:32.566]  Stewart, do five more minutes with us.
[02:07:32.606 --> 02:07:34.767]  And Owen, we're going to go a little bit the next hour with Jay Dyer.
[02:07:35.487 --> 02:07:37.329]  Stewart, what do you expect him to do with Biden?
[02:07:37.349 --> 02:07:39.631]  He's deteriorating extremely quick.
[02:07:39.651 --> 02:07:42.073]  I mean, he looks like an Alzheimer's patient now.
[02:07:42.533 --> 02:07:47.257]  I mean, they definitely cranked him up and he practiced that very short inaugural speech, which was okay.
[02:07:47.538 --> 02:07:49.279]  But other than that, he's like, what am I signing?
[02:07:49.600 --> 02:07:50.620]  Blah, blah, blah.
[02:07:50.640 --> 02:07:52.742]  I mean, he is like, what the hell's going on here?
[02:07:53.743 --> 02:07:57.026]  Well, like, like, like I was saying, he, he is a Chinese puppet.
[02:07:57.406 --> 02:08:02.451]  It's, you should look at this as DC is now the green zone of an occupying army.
[02:08:03.010 --> 02:08:05.371]  from Communist China using their puppet.
[02:08:05.632 --> 02:08:08.213]  And that's why it's a direct parallel to what the Founders faced.
[02:08:08.493 --> 02:08:18.920]  They were dealing with domestic puppets, the royal governors, who were doing the bidding of a foreign power that was king in Parliament that the people had no control over and no representation in.
[02:08:19.180 --> 02:08:20.521]  And we're in the same exact position.
[02:08:20.601 --> 02:08:25.844]  So of course they're looting the United States, they're shutting down our oil and gas, they're trying to kill our autonomy.
[02:08:26.124 --> 02:08:27.365]  So it benefits China.
[02:08:27.765 --> 02:08:30.106]  So we need to see them as an occupying enemy force.
[02:08:30.186 --> 02:08:35.049]  The problem they have is, is the troops that they're relying on, they can't even trust their own troops.
[02:08:35.069 --> 02:08:41.392]  They're so paranoid that they're already starting to purge and vet the troops that did that right there on Inauguration Day.
[02:08:41.753 --> 02:08:47.235]  That shows their weakness because they can't even trust their own troops because they know that those troops come from us.
[02:08:47.756 --> 02:08:48.176]  And so what they're
[02:08:48.795 --> 02:08:49.055]  We're good.
[02:09:06.181 --> 02:09:06.862]  We're good to go.
[02:09:22.183 --> 02:09:23.083]  You have to do something.
[02:09:23.223 --> 02:09:23.843]  That's where we're going.
[02:09:48.268 --> 02:09:56.972]  As we enter the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show today, Alex with us, Stuart Rhodes with us as well, a beautiful thing is happening right now.
[02:09:58.572 --> 02:10:11.557]  As perhaps one of the most obvious illegal criminal behaviors that we've ever witnessed taking place in the last 24 hours where Wall Street just tells you the people, no we get to rob you, you don't get to rob us, this is not how that goes.
[02:10:12.138 --> 02:10:15.259]  And now even Janet Yellen who's silent through all of this,
[02:10:16.257 --> 02:10:19.340]  But the Press Secretary Jen Psaki gets asked a question.
[02:10:19.540 --> 02:10:24.105]  Hey, what about Janet Yellen getting millions of dollars of payouts to speak at Wall Street firms?
[02:10:24.125 --> 02:10:28.869]  What about Joe Biden getting 30 Wall Street hedge funds managers to donate to his political campaign?
[02:10:28.889 --> 02:10:31.532]  Of course, Psaki says, oh, I don't know anything about that.
[02:10:31.632 --> 02:10:34.395]  And as Stuart Rhodes highlighted in the last segment, now there are
[02:10:34.935 --> 02:10:43.562]  Oversight committees investigating Biden's ties to China, including through University of Pennsylvania, another place that looks like it was maybe working with China and the Bidens.
[02:10:43.602 --> 02:10:45.103]  So, it's a beautiful thing.
[02:10:45.144 --> 02:10:52.630]  The world is waking up and all these people that thought Biden was going to save them from whatever they thought the boogeyman Trump was, they're all having voters remorse.
[02:10:52.710 --> 02:11:03.639]  So, I could be wrong about three months, but I think three months tops we have to, as Stuart was saying, we have time to really fix this, unify, and push back as we the people versus the corrupt world government.
[02:11:04.806 --> 02:11:08.415]  And Owen, I want to get Stewart's take on that, but Stewart, what about curveballs?
[02:11:08.736 --> 02:11:10.662]  This is so much revolutionary fervor now.
[02:11:11.830 --> 02:11:14.432]  I think the globalists are stealing this from Trump and it's stalling Biden.
[02:11:14.912 --> 02:11:15.813]  It's going to be insane.
[02:11:15.873 --> 02:11:23.497]  I mean, they're not going to, they're not going to, and now they're going to try to block people going in and looking at shorts and then propping up companies, which is a good thing they did.
[02:11:23.797 --> 02:11:26.839]  Now they're going to try to ban them not being able to shut down brick and mortar shops.
[02:11:27.099 --> 02:11:28.560]  Now everybody's going to get involved.
[02:11:28.640 --> 02:11:29.601]  I've never traded stock.
[02:11:29.921 --> 02:11:30.982]  I'm going to go get accounts now.
[02:11:31.322 --> 02:11:33.023]  I'm going to start trying to save American companies.
[02:11:33.303 --> 02:11:34.444]  I mean, this is crazy, Stuart.
[02:11:35.885 --> 02:11:38.587]  Yeah, well now we're using their tactics against them.
[02:11:38.607 --> 02:11:45.370]  Fifth Generation Warfare is to use economics and legal and everything else, so we should do the same thing.
[02:11:45.431 --> 02:11:46.131]  Exactly right.
[02:11:46.451 --> 02:11:55.436]  So like right now, we're helping protect whistleblowers who are doing a lawsuit about the election theft that alleges that everybody in Congress is illegitimate.
[02:11:55.456 --> 02:11:59.939]  The entire system is illegitimate because none of those were clean elections under federal law.
[02:12:00.299 --> 02:12:08.341]  And so I think it's important for us to push back all of those spectrums, across the spectrum, economically, legally, you know, in the court of public opinion especially.
[02:12:08.621 --> 02:12:11.442]  But yes, full-spectrum assault or counter-assault.
[02:12:13.622 --> 02:12:16.663]  Stuart, you've got to come back on for a full hour, maybe this weekend or next week.
[02:12:17.183 --> 02:12:21.944]  Hell, I'm going to do a special show Saturday, so maybe we should get you on for a full hour, then commercial-free.
[02:12:21.984 --> 02:12:24.925]  But in closing, the enemy's in trouble.
[02:12:24.945 --> 02:12:25.885]  I want people to know that.
[02:12:25.945 --> 02:12:27.506]  But they've got curveballs too.
[02:12:27.546 --> 02:12:28.546]  What should we be looking out for?
[02:12:29.693 --> 02:12:32.835]  Well, what you want to look out for is you don't want any Fort Sumters.
[02:12:32.875 --> 02:12:35.918]  Like the late, great Mike Vanderbilt said, no Fort Sumters.
[02:12:36.178 --> 02:12:37.679]  And I know it's frustrating for patriots.
[02:12:37.999 --> 02:12:40.981]  They're like, hey, we've been oppressed over and over again, a long chain of abuses.
[02:12:41.222 --> 02:12:42.803]  But the founding fathers were disciplined.
[02:12:42.823 --> 02:12:43.884]  We need to be disciplined as well.
[02:12:44.164 --> 02:12:57.914]  That means you separate from the illegitimate regime, declare it illegitimate, you nullify, do mass noncompliance, you come together and get strong so that when they come for you, they're the clear aggressors that have to come to you in your local state or county and oppress you.
[02:12:58.154 --> 02:13:01.697]  And the more they oppress the American people, the more they come over to our side.
[02:13:01.717 --> 02:13:02.878]  And that includes in the military.
[02:13:03.178 --> 02:13:06.260]  And that's our biggest audience, the most important audience, is the U.S.
[02:13:06.300 --> 02:13:06.660]  military.
[02:13:06.680 --> 02:13:12.605]  When they see Biden doing the bidding of China, they'll know that we were not conspiracy theorists and we said he was a Chinese puppet.
[02:13:12.625 --> 02:13:13.625]  They can see it for themselves.
[02:13:13.906 --> 02:13:17.588]  So he has a lot of serious problems, and so do all of his handlers.
[02:13:17.889 --> 02:13:19.990]  So let them continue to show their rears.
[02:13:20.350 --> 02:13:22.712]  Let them continue to put more rope on the deck.
[02:13:23.152 --> 02:13:23.693]  That's what I say.
[02:13:24.674 --> 02:13:26.216]  I agree, and by the way, that's not rhetoric.
[02:13:26.656 --> 02:13:29.359]  Joe Biden is literally a communist Chinese agent.
[02:13:30.100 --> 02:13:32.723]  I can't believe the establishment is this crazy, but they can't help it.
[02:13:32.803 --> 02:13:34.865]  If a government can take you over, they're going to try to do it.
[02:13:35.426 --> 02:13:37.268]  Stuart Rhodes, thank you so much.
[02:13:37.308 --> 02:13:37.829]  God bless you.
[02:13:37.869 --> 02:13:38.690]  We really appreciate you.
[02:13:39.070 --> 02:13:41.192]  Oath Keepers, you've got a couple of websites.
[02:13:41.212 --> 02:13:41.973]  What's the best website?
[02:13:42.274 --> 02:13:42.754]  OathKeepers.org?
[02:13:44.596 --> 02:13:48.898]  Once again, we encourage folks to go donate to Jessica's Defense Fund on our front page.
[02:13:48.918 --> 02:13:50.018]  We'll be posting a link to that.
[02:13:50.038 --> 02:13:51.779]  We've got to make sure that we take care of our own.
[02:13:52.159 --> 02:13:54.060]  So I do encourage you folks to do that.
[02:13:54.120 --> 02:13:54.621]  God bless.
[02:13:54.661 --> 02:13:57.022]  They're trying to set you up because you're a good guy.
[02:13:57.342 --> 02:14:00.524]  All right, Owen Troyer, we've got 40 seconds left before I take over with Jay Dyer.
[02:14:00.864 --> 02:14:04.346]  Tell us what you've got coming up in 45-50 minutes on The War Room.
[02:14:05.006 --> 02:14:06.067]  Well, everything, Alex.
[02:14:06.127 --> 02:14:13.131]  I've got a stacked news desk and I've just been percolating on all of this listening to you host the show here today with the great guests.
[02:14:13.171 --> 02:14:14.271]  So, I mean, it's everything.
[02:14:14.872 --> 02:14:20.015]  The Democrats labeling anybody that they don't like as a domestic terrorist and then legislating that they can go after you.
[02:14:20.675 --> 02:14:21.856]  More unsealed documents.
[02:14:22.356 --> 02:14:25.379]  In the sex trafficking of underage minors with Epstein and Maxwell.
[02:14:25.419 --> 02:14:26.560]  Nobody seems to care about that.
[02:14:26.841 --> 02:14:28.162]  They're arresting meme makers.
[02:14:28.202 --> 02:14:31.345]  The vengeance of Hillary Clinton from four years ago.
[02:14:32.026 --> 02:14:32.687]  Gamergate.
[02:14:32.847 --> 02:14:33.227]  All of it.
[02:14:33.407 --> 02:14:34.649]  Fake COVID pandemic.
[02:14:34.929 --> 02:14:35.469]  Lockdowns.
[02:14:35.529 --> 02:14:37.071]  It's all coming up on The War Room today.
[02:14:37.091 --> 02:14:37.571]  Incredible.
[02:14:37.652 --> 02:14:38.172]  All right.
[02:14:38.192 --> 02:14:38.613]  3 p.m.
[02:14:38.633 --> 02:14:39.253]  The War Room.
[02:14:39.273 --> 02:14:39.794]  We'll be right back.
[02:14:41.624 --> 02:14:47.450]  Okay, I don't sit here and just try to put black people on air fighting the new world order or saying smart things.
[02:14:47.490 --> 02:14:51.074]  That's just who keeps speaking up and saying things about half the time.
[02:14:51.595 --> 02:14:55.759]  The best stuff we see is black folks getting pissed off and speaking out about what's going on.
[02:14:55.779 --> 02:14:58.783]  Then of course they get blocked on Twitter, they get blocked on Facebook, you name it.
[02:14:59.183 --> 02:15:00.164]  Two videos today.
[02:15:00.184 --> 02:15:01.105]  There's even more.
[02:15:01.986 --> 02:15:03.247]  Black people saying stuff I agree with.
[02:15:03.267 --> 02:15:07.051]  Again, if a white person says something that's smart, I'll put it on, but I'm not kissing black people's ass.
[02:15:07.111 --> 02:15:13.137]  It's just very good to see black folks really getting it, really getting it quick, and really starting to figure it out.
[02:15:13.617 --> 02:15:18.722]  And now they can just wake up, the other black folks, the other white folks, and the other everybody else, we're going to save this country.
[02:15:18.742 --> 02:15:20.844]  I know Infowars is exploding in India.
[02:15:21.665 --> 02:15:24.908]  And I'm just going to leave it at that, because if I talk about it, the enemy will go find it and block it.
[02:15:26.095 --> 02:15:29.278]  I mean, we're getting like 5-10 million views on videos in India.
[02:15:29.998 --> 02:15:30.899]  So the Indians get it.
[02:15:30.919 --> 02:15:33.241]  I mean, that's all I care about is humanity waking up.
[02:15:33.261 --> 02:15:34.462]  So we salute the folks in India.
[02:15:34.742 --> 02:15:35.163]  We love you.
[02:15:35.183 --> 02:15:38.846]  A black Keystone XL worker rant blaming Joe Biden for eliminating his job.
[02:15:38.946 --> 02:15:39.987]  Well, you didn't blame him.
[02:15:40.007 --> 02:15:40.547]  It's true.
[02:15:48.311 --> 02:15:50.672]  Through executive fiat is going viral.
[02:15:51.193 --> 02:15:52.253]  And again, it's built.
[02:15:52.954 --> 02:15:53.894]  It brings in the oil.
[02:15:53.934 --> 02:16:02.199]  The same oil is going to get sold via the railroad that Bill Gates and Soros and Warren Buffett own.
[02:16:02.219 --> 02:16:14.766]  They own the majority of the railroad that takes the... So instead of going on a pipeline to us now, even though we built this $5 billion pipeline or whatever, I think it's more than that, it's going to take billions a day in oil to us, to Shreveport, Texas, the refineries.
[02:16:15.984 --> 02:16:16.424]  Stroke of a pen.
[02:16:16.444 --> 02:16:17.324]  It just doesn't make any sense.
[02:16:17.344 --> 02:16:18.985]  It doesn't make any sense how
[02:16:42.975 --> 02:16:48.278]  At the stroke of a pen, me and my buddies, all of us, we lost our jobs.
[02:16:49.398 --> 02:16:51.539]  I just gotta bought this car.
[02:16:54.320 --> 02:16:57.462]  Had a six year payment plan on it.
[02:16:59.803 --> 02:17:01.464]  So I'm probably gonna have to sell the car.
[02:17:05.586 --> 02:17:10.488]  And then, probably won't be able to make next month's mortgage.
[02:17:22.056 --> 02:17:22.777]  It doesn't make any sense.
[02:17:24.319 --> 02:17:25.541]  It doesn't make any sense.
[02:17:26.543 --> 02:17:34.234]  How did Donald Trump... I know how.
[02:17:35.175 --> 02:17:35.716]  They took it.
[02:17:37.011 --> 02:17:38.513]  They didn't steal the election.
[02:17:39.213 --> 02:17:42.557]  When you steal something, that's when no one knows that you took it.
[02:17:43.038 --> 02:17:58.975]  But they outright, boldly, went in and said, we're gonna fucking take this presidency from you, screw the American people, screw you Donald Trump, screw everybody, America last, and oh, by the way, you guys are gonna lose your job.
[02:18:11.738 --> 02:18:13.179]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:18:14.641 --> 02:18:17.303]  Now here's another black nurse at a nursing home.
[02:18:17.383 --> 02:18:18.864]  He's watching all the old people die.
[02:18:20.125 --> 02:18:22.167]  What I told you, we've got one fellow works with us.
[02:18:22.187 --> 02:18:24.109]  His mom is a head nurse at a nursing home.
[02:18:24.730 --> 02:18:26.811]  And people died and other people can't even get out of bed.
[02:18:26.851 --> 02:18:29.274]  Just everybody's suddenly not even coming to dinner, lunch, breakfast.
[02:18:29.294 --> 02:18:30.174]  Everybody's just dying.
[02:18:31.476 --> 02:18:32.376]  That's the first shot.
[02:18:32.556 --> 02:18:33.938]  They give them a second, they're going to all die.
[02:18:35.017 --> 02:18:41.343]  And now it's all just, oh, we sent 12,000 old people and killed them in New York and Letitia James says it's okay and laughs about it on TV today.
[02:18:42.824 --> 02:18:43.945]  And they're just doing it.
[02:18:44.025 --> 02:18:44.485]  Exactly.
[02:18:44.866 --> 02:18:45.646]  They didn't steal it.
[02:18:45.766 --> 02:18:46.287]  They took it.
[02:18:46.567 --> 02:18:47.668]  They pissed in our face.
[02:18:48.048 --> 02:18:49.109]  They told us it was raining.
[02:18:49.910 --> 02:18:56.636]  And it's so... So George Soros, who says he wants to destroy America, his life mission is to destroy America.
[02:18:56.976 --> 02:18:59.859]  And so he gets billions more and the oil goes to China.
[02:19:01.638 --> 02:19:02.299]  It's our oil.
[02:19:02.579 --> 02:19:03.119]  We drilled it.
[02:19:03.580 --> 02:19:04.440]  The Canadians drilled it.
[02:19:05.141 --> 02:19:06.522]  They are dropping like flies.
[02:19:06.582 --> 02:19:07.263]  Nursing home.
[02:19:07.863 --> 02:19:09.224]  Vaccines killing patients.
[02:19:09.244 --> 02:19:10.025]  Here's a black nurse.
[02:19:10.365 --> 02:19:10.705]  Here it is.
[02:19:13.147 --> 02:19:14.508]  I know when they are happy.
[02:19:14.528 --> 02:19:15.529]  I know when they are sad.
[02:19:15.569 --> 02:19:16.670]  I know when they are frustrated.
[02:19:17.030 --> 02:19:18.371]  I know when they are feeling good.
[02:19:18.972 --> 02:19:20.393]  I know these people.
[02:19:20.413 --> 02:19:21.914]  I'm around them for eight hours.
[02:19:22.275 --> 02:19:25.437]  And many people who are CNAs can testify of the same thing.
[02:19:25.917 --> 02:19:27.839]  We know the people that we care for.
[02:19:29.981 --> 02:19:30.121]  So.
[02:19:32.321 --> 02:19:39.505]  Two weeks after these people received the vaccine, particularly the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.
[02:19:40.486 --> 02:19:47.389]  Two weeks after they received the vaccine, or three weeks later, I am seeing this pattern.
[02:19:48.330 --> 02:19:57.115]  This pattern of not just side effects, to the point where we had people who were once walking, who are no longer walking.
[02:19:58.656 --> 02:20:00.957]  People who were once talking, who can no longer talk.
[02:20:05.473 --> 02:20:11.099]  People who were once able to think, couldn't think of any.
[02:20:16.645 --> 02:20:22.932]  The expert says that the vaccine, the vaccine do not have the COVID-19 in it.
[02:20:23.093 --> 02:20:23.613]  I understand.
[02:20:23.974 --> 02:20:24.214]  Okay.
[02:20:26.178 --> 02:20:28.739]  It's supposed to be a stimulus, right?
[02:20:29.059 --> 02:20:37.262]  A stimulus that's supposed to help your immune system to fight against the virus if you were to confront it.
[02:20:37.762 --> 02:20:39.703]  That's the purpose of this vaccine, right?
[02:20:40.203 --> 02:20:40.864]  I understand that.
[02:20:40.964 --> 02:20:42.044]  I'm not anti-vaccine.
[02:20:42.324 --> 02:20:43.625]  I understand the purpose of it.
[02:20:44.265 --> 02:20:45.966]  That's not the point of what I'm trying to say.
[02:20:46.306 --> 02:20:47.926]  But this is what I'm saying, friends.
[02:20:48.467 --> 02:20:49.387]  Our residents are dying.
[02:20:55.325 --> 02:21:01.051]  Our residents are dying after they have taken this vaccine.
[02:21:01.071 --> 02:21:06.176]  And what troubles me, what troubles me, this is not even being spoken about.
[02:21:07.017 --> 02:21:11.722]  What bothers my heart is that it's almost like, don't talk about this.
[02:21:12.003 --> 02:21:12.623]  Just keep quiet.
[02:21:14.358 --> 02:21:19.082]  Let's go along with the notion, and I'm sitting here thinking like, first of all, I'm a Christian.
[02:21:19.102 --> 02:21:25.147]  I can't live with my conscience knowing this is what's happening in front of my eyes.
[02:21:25.867 --> 02:21:30.571]  Now, when you ask questions, when you ask those in authority, those in a position that could give you answers...
[02:21:33.100 --> 02:21:35.120]  Well, that's up on InfoWars.com.
[02:21:35.140 --> 02:21:36.241]  They're dropping like flies.
[02:21:37.001 --> 02:21:39.001]  It's only got 64,000 views.
[02:21:39.061 --> 02:21:40.282]  It needs 10 million views.
[02:21:40.362 --> 02:21:43.302]  Send it to everyone you know that has parents in nursing homes.
[02:21:43.322 --> 02:21:44.263]  I'm going to explain this again.
[02:21:45.783 --> 02:21:48.484]  In the second round, they're having large percentages die.
[02:21:48.564 --> 02:21:50.884]  I'm talking if there's 50 beds, 2 people die.
[02:21:50.924 --> 02:21:51.764]  If there's 100 beds, 4 die.
[02:21:51.784 --> 02:21:52.724]  This is what I'm being told.
[02:21:53.065 --> 02:21:54.145]  We're talking murder.
[02:21:54.725 --> 02:21:56.565]  Who is now retiring?
[02:21:56.765 --> 02:21:58.526]  Who is now going to nursing homes?
[02:21:58.566 --> 02:21:59.066]  Baby boomers.
[02:22:00.401 --> 02:22:01.742]  They're killing them.
[02:22:01.802 --> 02:22:02.722]  They're setting it up.
[02:22:03.162 --> 02:22:07.144]  They're setting the precedent, and they admit Bill Gates says he wants to get rid of old people.
[02:22:08.724 --> 02:22:14.446]  The vaccine is designed to kill old people, but it's so sophisticated, it also attacks women's placentas.
[02:22:14.566 --> 02:22:15.327]  That's on record.
[02:22:17.047 --> 02:22:18.608]  It causes autoimmune disorders.
[02:22:18.668 --> 02:22:20.028]  It's five viruses.
[02:22:23.110 --> 02:22:28.912]  Just the Pfizer vaccine goes after everything in your damn body.
[02:22:29.986 --> 02:22:32.188]  I've spent days reading all the medical reports.
[02:22:32.908 --> 02:22:33.208]  Weeks!
[02:22:33.388 --> 02:22:36.070]  I mean, I've just, all of us have seen, I've stacked some stuff I read.
[02:22:36.090 --> 02:22:40.413]  I did a special report like a month and a half ago, I spent eight hours getting ready for it.
[02:22:41.354 --> 02:22:44.416]  And I had a headache so bad after I read it all, I just, I don't even know what to do.
[02:22:45.677 --> 02:22:51.741]  This is soft kill, this is eugenics, it's run by a crazy, Nazis, the Junkers!
[02:22:53.162 --> 02:22:53.983]  So, it's here.
[02:22:55.286 --> 02:22:57.168]  And this is pure evil everybody signed on to.
[02:22:57.228 --> 02:22:58.730]  Folks, they're murdering the old people.
[02:22:59.050 --> 02:23:00.271]  They know full well what they're doing.
[02:23:00.631 --> 02:23:01.853]  Jay Dyer's a really smart fella.
[02:23:02.433 --> 02:23:08.519]  And he's helped us do a lot of research on the Great Reset and how we're going into full takeover mode.
[02:23:08.539 --> 02:23:10.501]  So he takes over the next 45 minutes.
[02:23:10.521 --> 02:23:11.362]  We really appreciate him.
[02:23:11.802 --> 02:23:12.143]  Briefly.
[02:23:13.339 --> 02:23:14.400]  I don't know how long I'm going to be on air.
[02:23:14.560 --> 02:23:15.981]  The global's trying to shut us down right now.
[02:23:16.001 --> 02:23:17.962]  There's so many attacks, I'm not even going to waste your time hearing it.
[02:23:18.002 --> 02:23:22.946]  I just need your prayers and I need your word of mouth so we'll be as effective as possible to the very end fighting this.
[02:23:23.366 --> 02:23:24.927]  You better download the videos, the articles.
[02:23:24.947 --> 02:23:29.490]  They'll be even more valuable coming up when, I mean, like half your neighborhood's going to be dying, folks.
[02:23:29.530 --> 02:23:32.152]  I mean, a few years from now, this is just a total kill operation.
[02:23:32.452 --> 02:23:33.133]  They're just normalizing it.
[02:23:33.153 --> 02:23:34.273]  They're going to say it's a new virus.
[02:23:34.333 --> 02:23:34.954]  It's killing everybody.
[02:23:34.974 --> 02:23:36.035]  It's really going to be the vaccine.
[02:23:36.695 --> 02:23:37.816]  They told us they're coming to kill us.
[02:23:37.856 --> 02:23:39.577]  So please financially support us.
[02:23:39.637 --> 02:23:40.858]  Great products while you still can.

[02:24:13.451 --> 02:24:18.657]  But whatever you do, get right with God, because this is the giant world government satanic takeover, and we're all obsolete.
[02:24:18.697 --> 02:24:19.898]  We're all illegitimate.
[02:24:19.918 --> 02:24:22.601]  We're all non-essential, according to these Satanist devil worshippers.
[02:24:23.823 --> 02:24:25.625]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:25.645 --> 02:24:27.787]  I'm your guest, one host, Jay Dyer.
[02:24:28.902 --> 02:24:31.103]  Today we're going to be talking about technocracy.
[02:24:31.123 --> 02:24:38.725]  I want to explain the history of technocracy and then get into transhumanism, the ultimate goal of the technocrats from their own writings.
[02:24:39.245 --> 02:24:54.610]  And this will help you understand that we're talking about a plan that is literally, in a sense, thousands of years old or all the way back to the beginning of the world, if you want to go back to Satan, the fall of the angelic beings and how they wanted to rebel against God and set up that Babel society.
[02:24:55.216 --> 02:25:00.980]  And that's really what they're trying to recreate throughout the rest of history is the emergence of Babel.
[02:25:02.141 --> 02:25:07.105]  One of the key examples of this in history that's the most famous though is Plato's Republic.
[02:25:07.806 --> 02:25:13.950]  So I'm going to show you a couple things from Plato's Republic where he kind of spills the beans because this is written, remember, for the elite.
[02:25:15.191 --> 02:25:20.956]  It's not expected that most members of society would read or understand what Plato was writing.
[02:25:23.268 --> 02:25:30.100]  So we're going to look at The Republic and see what he says about how society should be governed and what the plan is.
[02:25:30.180 --> 02:25:36.111]  He says early on that the society has to be arranged in a pyramid.
[02:25:36.957 --> 02:25:37.737]  Literally a pyramid.
[02:25:37.777 --> 02:25:41.938]  He says at the top is the Philosopher Kings, and they know what's going on, right?
[02:25:41.958 --> 02:25:43.938]  They're the technocratic elite.
[02:25:44.098 --> 02:25:51.960]  And in fact, Plato himself, following the Pythagoreans, said that the technocratic elite had a mystical, magical view of numbers.
[02:25:52.020 --> 02:25:54.961]  They literally thought the numbers themselves were divine.
[02:25:55.701 --> 02:26:02.642]  And this would lead to that technocratic mathematical model of everything being quantified, everything being tracked and traced.
[02:26:03.542 --> 02:26:05.963]  Because at the top, the philosopher elite know that
[02:26:06.984 --> 02:26:16.830]  The lower people or the people down at the bottom of the pyramid, they're never going to grasp the way the society is run, how it's set up and how the elite think, right?
[02:26:16.850 --> 02:26:18.672]  Because they just don't have the propensity.
[02:26:18.692 --> 02:26:22.894]  And this is where you get that model of the genetics, right?
[02:26:22.994 --> 02:26:23.975]  Eugenios, right?
[02:26:23.995 --> 02:26:25.696]  This is the Greek idea of
[02:26:26.641 --> 02:26:33.344]  Perfecting the race by getting rid of the lower classes, by getting rid of the people at the bottom of the pyramid.
[02:26:34.004 --> 02:26:41.867]  And then trying to engineer, right, progeny so that the elite, their offspring reproduce and go into the future.
[02:26:41.947 --> 02:26:47.449]  And the offspring of the lower classes, the bottom of the pyramid, don't reproduce.
[02:26:47.710 --> 02:26:49.790]  Plato was very, very adamant about this.
[02:26:49.810 --> 02:26:53.532]  And he said that for your society to run, for your society to work,
[02:26:54.269 --> 02:26:59.510]  It has to have this extremely controlled and regimented numbers game, basically.
[02:26:59.530 --> 02:27:01.111]  We're going to do game theory.
[02:27:01.211 --> 02:27:07.133]  Keep that in mind, game theory, because that's going to come back up here in a minute when we talk about the Rand Corporation and DARPA.
[02:27:08.453 --> 02:27:12.594]  But Plato said that the society has to be held together by a kind of myth.
[02:27:13.974 --> 02:27:16.215]  He calls this the Ring of Gyges.
[02:27:16.395 --> 02:27:22.957]  And this is a famous, if you watch the Lord of the Rings, you might think that there's some interesting connections there because this ring of power, this myth,
[02:27:23.433 --> 02:27:26.475]  Tells the story of somebody who found a ring that would make people invisible.
[02:27:27.456 --> 02:27:44.810]  Now, in Plato's telling of the story, what this means is that the secret of the myth is that the body is bad, the physical world doesn't matter, and so the removal of the body, the invisibility of the body, points towards the elevation of reason in Plato's philosophy.
[02:27:45.130 --> 02:27:47.232]  Because Plato basically worships reason, right?
[02:27:47.272 --> 02:27:51.515]  The philosopher king at the top of the pyramid, he's closer to the divine because
[02:27:52.443 --> 02:27:55.906]  He operates and lives his life on the basis of pure reasoning.
[02:27:55.946 --> 02:27:56.447]  Like a Vulcan.
[02:27:56.467 --> 02:27:57.648]  Think of like a Vulcan, right?
[02:27:57.888 --> 02:28:01.931]  Like Spock's, you know, only goes on the basis of logic and reason.
[02:28:01.951 --> 02:28:03.293]  He's like a machine, right?
[02:28:03.313 --> 02:28:08.057]  He doesn't operate on the basis of any kind of emotion or empathy or love, right?
[02:28:09.178 --> 02:28:15.944]  And so in the same way, anything that has to do with passions or the body has to be suppressed, has to be pushed down.
[02:28:16.710 --> 02:28:18.491]  It has to be ultimately eliminated, right?
[02:28:18.531 --> 02:28:24.995]  Now, if you're a Christian, or if you have a religious perspective, you probably think, well, that sounds kind of true, except that we don't worship reason, right?
[02:28:25.015 --> 02:28:25.995]  We're not rationalists.
[02:28:26.035 --> 02:28:29.817]  We don't believe that reason is a god or a goddess, right?
[02:28:29.857 --> 02:28:31.378]  Like the French revolutionaries thought.
[02:28:31.658 --> 02:28:39.403]  But for Plato, his system does operate that way, and that's why they worship numbers, because geometry, numbers, forms, right?
[02:28:39.423 --> 02:28:45.446]  These are closer to the abstract, closer to the divine, and that's closer to what's objectively true.
[02:28:46.104 --> 02:28:52.169]  Whereas things in this world are subject to constant change and evolving and flux, right?
[02:28:52.750 --> 02:28:54.672]  So that's the structure of Plato's system.
[02:28:54.752 --> 02:29:04.160]  And he says that a secret society, yes, a secret society will have to be in place to keep this secret of the myth, right, the myth of the ring.
[02:29:05.121 --> 02:29:06.222]  It's called the Noble Lie.
[02:29:06.242 --> 02:29:07.763]  You've probably heard of this view, the Noble Lie.
[02:29:07.783 --> 02:29:12.928]  So the state erects and wants to control secret society religious myths.
[02:29:13.746 --> 02:29:20.749]  The book goes on to talk about how you would set up this ideal republic, and the ideal republic is one that is run basically like a computer program, like a machine.
[02:29:43.132 --> 02:29:44.355]  There's no private property.
[02:29:44.375 --> 02:29:48.023]  There's a complete control by the state of every area of life.
[02:29:48.163 --> 02:29:53.234]  Everything is tracked and traced, ultimately, even though Plato didn't know about, you know, surveillance and this kind of stuff.
[02:29:54.088 --> 02:29:59.972]  The model, right, of this completely top-down society, command-and-control society, is found in Plato.
[02:30:00.373 --> 02:30:04.195]  And that's why you'll find the 20th century technocrats like Bertrand Russell and H.G.
[02:30:04.215 --> 02:30:05.957]  Wells, they literally cite Plato.
[02:30:05.977 --> 02:30:09.639]  They say, we're going to erect a global platonic republic.
[02:30:10.200 --> 02:30:12.461]  And we, as the priest class, are going to control it.
[02:30:12.962 --> 02:30:19.867]  If you look at religion, religion for them is just the outer sphere, the kind of profane outer portico of the inner temple.
[02:30:20.267 --> 02:30:20.707]  We're good.
[02:30:35.876 --> 02:30:38.278]  That Orwell talked about, right?
[02:30:38.298 --> 02:30:40.320]  So you have the Outer Party and the Inner Party.
[02:30:40.400 --> 02:30:43.682]  And if you've read Quigley, then you know what Orwell was talking about, right?
[02:30:43.882 --> 02:30:45.043]  Who is the Outer Party?
[02:30:45.083 --> 02:30:55.211]  Well, the Outer Party is the managerial class, the technocratic elites that follow the most powerful elites at the top of the pyramid, who are the enlightened ones, right?
[02:30:55.251 --> 02:30:59.594]  Who are, according to Quigley, about 100 years ago, the Society of the Elect.
[02:30:59.875 --> 02:31:03.037]  That's the people that from the background ran the British Empire, right?
[02:31:03.377 --> 02:31:04.078]  Cecil Rhodes,
[02:31:04.538 --> 02:31:05.359]  We're good to go.
[02:31:21.144 --> 02:31:35.303]  And this came out actually before Huxley, so anything Huxley had written was actually just, he's late to the game in terms of what Lord Birkin had talked about in this famous cosmopolitan essay that I think was right around the turn of the century, 1905, 1919, 1920, somewhere in there.
[02:31:38.059 --> 02:31:39.501]  If you look on Google, you can find that.
[02:31:39.561 --> 02:31:47.708]  It's a real essay, and he says that in the future, right, we're going to erect this technocracy where nothing will be as it was.
[02:31:48.088 --> 02:31:50.390]  Literally everything will undergo this revolution.
[02:31:50.771 --> 02:31:53.213]  You're not going to have children the way you thought you would have children.
[02:31:53.273 --> 02:31:55.395]  Children, he says, will be born in test tubes.
[02:31:55.435 --> 02:32:03.442]  He wrote that a hundred years before people were actually saying that we can, you know, do genetic modification of children, right?
[02:32:04.904 --> 02:32:05.945]  Designer babies, right?
[02:32:05.965 --> 02:32:07.466]  So he was talking about this a hundred years ago.
[02:32:07.546 --> 02:32:12.670]  So when we come back, we'll take a look at some of the things that Lord Birkenhead talks about in his essay.
[02:32:13.271 --> 02:32:19.136]  And then we're going to look to the area where you wouldn't expect the technocracy to really come to fruition.
[02:32:19.636 --> 02:32:20.657]  That would be Vietnam.
[02:32:21.217 --> 02:32:28.563]  Yes, Vietnam was the big test lab on how to bring technocracy to the rest of the world.
[02:32:28.583 --> 02:32:29.544]  The Alex Jones Show on TikTok.
[02:32:30.037 --> 02:32:31.898]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:32:31.918 --> 02:32:34.259]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[02:32:34.600 --> 02:32:37.161]  And you can, of course, follow me on all the social media outlets.
[02:32:37.241 --> 02:32:47.046]  And I'm the author of this book, Esoteric Hollywood, and its sequel, Esoteric Hollywood 2, which actually has a whole section, 100 pages or so, on what we're talking about today.
[02:32:47.066 --> 02:32:54.230]  If you want to get into where Hollywood actually showed us ahead of time in many of their products, what would be the future.
[02:32:54.330 --> 02:32:55.451]  Now, I was mentioning the
[02:32:56.181 --> 02:33:02.410]  Lord Birkenhead's essay from 1929, and it's about what the world would be in 100 years, right?
[02:33:02.430 --> 02:33:06.375]  So from 1929 to 2029, Lord Birkenhead says, again, before Aldous Huxley had written Brave New World, he says that
[02:33:13.507 --> 02:33:19.853]  There will be the regulated choice of anyone's children by the cabinet of the future government, right?
[02:33:19.893 --> 02:33:23.937]  So, the future government will decide how to breed nations, right?
[02:33:24.038 --> 02:33:26.080]  Out of the industrial dullards, he says.
[02:33:26.120 --> 02:33:31.145]  Of course, you can see that arrogant attitude of the middle and lower classes by these elites.
[02:33:31.725 --> 02:33:36.490]  And they really wanted to bring in this technocracy as soon as possible, but
[02:33:36.890 --> 02:33:44.773]  Really, it took a long time for this to come to fruition in the sense of the platonic attitude of how to have a perfect government, a perfect society.
[02:33:45.333 --> 02:33:58.477]  So this, you'll notice, is in continuity with all communist ideas, which is the idea that you can create a perfectly rational, right, utopian type of government that will run perfectly in society.
[02:33:58.577 --> 02:33:59.057]  There won't be
[02:34:00.246 --> 02:34:00.967]  We're good to go.
[02:34:22.422 --> 02:34:22.903]  We're good to go.
[02:34:47.739 --> 02:34:57.071]  And this is about the British spies who came over, Roald Dahl, Ian Fleming, Noel Coward, who were connected to Hollywood, really high level Hollywood elites.
[02:34:57.271 --> 02:35:02.437]  And their job was to get the US government involved in international policing, right?
[02:35:02.457 --> 02:35:05.241]  To get the US out of that attitude of
[02:35:06.152 --> 02:35:09.874]  Non-interventionism, to get them involved, especially in World War II.
[02:35:09.954 --> 02:35:12.015]  And then after World War II, the U.S.
[02:35:12.255 --> 02:35:16.518]  Empire would take the place, right, of what the British Empire used to do.
[02:35:16.938 --> 02:35:18.919]  It would become the engine of the technocracy.
[02:35:18.939 --> 02:35:19.819]  And this was planned.
[02:35:19.879 --> 02:35:25.062]  Again, these British elites are saying this at the turn of the century, right?
[02:35:25.122 --> 02:35:32.586]  By the time of World War I, World War II, they're figuring out ways to bring America back under the aegis of that British Malthusian attitude.
[02:35:33.067 --> 02:35:33.647]  And guess what?
[02:35:34.187 --> 02:35:35.668]  This explains why.
[02:35:36.243 --> 02:35:50.535]  The Western elite, right, have always supported both the fascists and the Marxists and the communists across the world, even though there was a kind of a Cold War play going on of opposition, right, between East and West.
[02:35:50.595 --> 02:35:52.156]  And at a certain level, there was.
[02:35:52.336 --> 02:36:01.324]  At the top, at the top, the people who are running things, they're looking towards that synthesis, which they call the third way, right?
[02:36:01.344 --> 02:36:03.425]  The third way is what Quigley writes about.
[02:36:03.746 --> 02:36:04.987]  It's the blending of
[02:36:05.686 --> 02:36:13.094]  The worst aspects of Western capitalism and monopoly capitalism and the worst aspects of Eurasian communism.
[02:36:13.855 --> 02:36:21.524]  And so one key figure that we want to have in mind here is Julian Huxley, the brother of Aldous, coming out of those same circles as Lord Birkenhead and H.G.
[02:36:21.564 --> 02:36:22.926]  Wells and Bertrand Russell, right?
[02:36:23.546 --> 02:36:24.868]  And he wrote in his UNESCO
[02:36:25.856 --> 02:36:32.399]  ...philosophy that the future would be run by this technocratic dictatorship on the basis of eugenics.
[02:36:32.459 --> 02:36:32.979]  But guess what?
[02:36:33.019 --> 02:36:39.282]  He said he knew even then, when he wrote this in 1946, that eugenics was kind of getting a bad name, right?
[02:36:39.322 --> 02:36:41.383]  Hitler was kind of making this look bad.
[02:36:41.443 --> 02:36:42.984]  It's not, this doesn't look too good.
[02:36:43.024 --> 02:36:50.968]  So let's just rebrand it as biometrics, bioeducation, plant, family plant.
[02:36:50.988 --> 02:36:51.988]  So they just renamed it.
[02:36:52.208 --> 02:36:52.768]  That's all they did.
[02:36:52.848 --> 02:36:53.969]  I just rebranded it all.
[02:36:55.828 --> 02:37:03.855]  And he says, let's let the scientific elite from a centralized global control center just decide everything.
[02:37:04.656 --> 02:37:06.077]  Decide who gets born, who doesn't.
[02:37:06.538 --> 02:37:08.820]  Let's rearrange all life, all society.
[02:37:08.840 --> 02:37:10.021]  So that is the technique.
[02:37:10.041 --> 02:37:12.283]  You want to understand the technocratic philosophy and attitude.
[02:37:12.383 --> 02:37:15.466]  It's public right here in Julian Huxley's book.
[02:37:15.526 --> 02:37:17.668]  And guess what Julian Huxley coined?
[02:37:17.688 --> 02:37:18.629]  What term he coined?
[02:37:19.355 --> 02:37:20.096]  Transhumanism.
[02:37:20.237 --> 02:37:20.698]  That's right.
[02:37:21.138 --> 02:37:23.683]  Julian is the guy who gave us that term.
[02:37:23.703 --> 02:37:31.717]  And as we see here in a minute, that's going to be the guiding philosophy that leads the elite in terms of what they would do over the last century in terms of all these wars.
[02:37:31.817 --> 02:37:32.138]  Remember,
[02:37:32.714 --> 02:37:34.755]  War is a racket for this great game.
[02:37:35.155 --> 02:37:37.696]  War is a racket for these powerful elites.
[02:37:38.357 --> 02:37:47.341]  Not saying that there aren't, you know, legitimate battles and people on both sides and people, you know, struggling with one another, you know, that really goes on in these conflicts, for sure.
[02:37:47.621 --> 02:37:51.322]  But at the top, again, it's a bankers and corporate man's game.
[02:37:51.643 --> 02:37:54.404]  And that's who benefits from war, not the people.
[02:37:54.424 --> 02:38:01.427]  And if you read the social planners, they actually say that you can get a lot more done in wartime than you can in peacetime.
[02:38:02.179 --> 02:38:09.101]  War is one of the greatest ways to advance a social engineering tactic, and that's what they did with World War I and World War II.
[02:38:09.201 --> 02:38:13.402]  As Quigley notes, that the banking elite essentially engineered those two world wars.
[02:38:13.682 --> 02:38:13.962]  Why?
[02:38:14.582 --> 02:38:28.885]  Well, there's multiple reasons, but they wanted to get rid of any competition from the Holy Roman Empire, the German dynasty that was Catholic, and they wanted to get rid of any competition from Russia, right, and the Orthodox Church in Russia.
[02:38:29.386 --> 02:38:39.586]  So, that was the purpose of the two world wars, and then the Cold War sets up this dialectic, out of which would come the synthesis of the global government.
[02:38:41.619 --> 02:38:44.741]  I'm not telling you anything that these people didn't already write about.
[02:38:44.801 --> 02:38:50.864]  That's why Russell and HG Wells talk so favorably of communism and Sovietism.
[02:38:51.864 --> 02:38:52.945]  I thought they were from the West.
[02:38:53.525 --> 02:38:54.346]  Why would they be?
[02:38:54.786 --> 02:38:56.807]  I thought they were proponents of democracy, right?
[02:38:57.547 --> 02:39:04.091]  But why are so many of these British elites so favorable towards fascism and Sovietism and communism?
[02:39:04.991 --> 02:39:06.892]  Well, it's because they're programs.
[02:39:06.992 --> 02:39:08.773]  They're test tubes, right?
[02:39:09.293 --> 02:39:10.694]  War is a test tube.
[02:39:11.147 --> 02:39:13.209]  Typically, from this technocratic attitude.
[02:39:13.249 --> 02:39:15.791]  Again, I'm not saying there's not real war and there's not real POWs.
[02:39:15.831 --> 02:39:30.184]  I'm just saying that from the attitude of the people at the RAND Corporation, from the big institutes, right, the technocratic elite, DARPA, they're studying war to perfect the techniques of how to apply that in the future, right?
[02:39:30.544 --> 02:39:33.527]  It's R&D, it's research and development, RAND.
[02:39:34.348 --> 02:39:36.890]  So a lot of the wars, especially during the Cold War,
[02:39:37.881 --> 02:39:38.461]  We're good to go.
[02:40:07.423 --> 02:40:08.183]  You know what I do?
[02:40:08.263 --> 02:40:09.944]  I do your homework for you, right?
[02:40:10.645 --> 02:40:14.546]  I'm the nerd in class, the Chad nerd, that does your homework.
[02:40:14.566 --> 02:40:31.835]  You come and you copy off of me, because I know a lot of you guys don't have time to do homework, but I'm the nerd that has the time to do the homework, so you can trust me when I summarize these big, fat, boring books like Pentagon's Brain by Annie Jacobson or Soldiers of Reason by Alex Abea.
[02:40:32.777 --> 02:40:43.000]  Alex himself, Alex Jones, you know, some 10, 15 years ago had interviewed Alex Abaya and done many, many talks himself on the history of the Rand Corporation.
[02:40:43.020 --> 02:40:46.341]  So I have to give credit to Alex for hipping me to that many years ago.
[02:40:47.201 --> 02:40:57.584]  But the reason I want to talk about Amy Jacobson's book is that she says, and this was not a conspiracy text, by the way, this was nominated for Pulitzer the year that it came out, a few years ago.
[02:40:59.022 --> 02:41:06.084]  She says that really Vietnam was the pioneering test bed for the modern technocracy, right?
[02:41:06.524 --> 02:41:21.207]  And so if we want to look at how do we get to DARPA today with its experiments on super soldiers and implantable microchips and, you know, bio enhancement and biometrics and all that stuff that DARPA developed, including the Internet, right?
[02:41:21.308 --> 02:41:22.768]  Then we have to go to the Cold War.
[02:41:22.808 --> 02:41:27.189]  The Cold War is what would foster and develop all of this high tech.
[02:41:27.847 --> 02:41:29.767]  That we saw rolled out, right?
[02:41:30.047 --> 02:41:36.468]  Supercomputers, AI, cryptography, the Internet, that's all coming out of that Cold War setting.
[02:41:37.269 --> 02:41:45.690]  And so that's why we want to look at her analysis of Vietnam and all of the test programs and projects that were going on during the Vietnam War.
[02:41:45.710 --> 02:41:51.891]  That when you see this, you're going to be like, oh, we're actually living in that setting now.
[02:41:52.231 --> 02:41:55.612]  All of those techniques are being applied to the world now.
[02:41:58.896 --> 02:42:03.758]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:42:03.818 --> 02:42:05.959]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer, Jason Alicis.
[02:42:05.979 --> 02:42:10.621]  If you like the content that I'm putting out, what I do is I summarize these elite techs, right?
[02:42:10.682 --> 02:42:20.406]  So I go to Annie Jacobson and Julian Huxley and Bertrand Russell and AC Wells and Miles Copeland and I read all these books and I summarize them for me.
[02:42:20.426 --> 02:42:23.768]  So if you want to get access to that, you can go to Jason Alicis and subscribe.
[02:42:24.492 --> 02:42:31.561]  Or $4.95 a month or $60 a year to get archives of hours and hours and hours of elite education, right?
[02:42:31.681 --> 02:42:33.463]  At a pennies on the dollar price.
[02:42:33.543 --> 02:42:38.429]  Basically, you can get a PhD, a master's level PhD, whatever one you want, right?
[02:42:38.690 --> 02:42:40.692]  In the writings of the elite themselves.
[02:42:41.653 --> 02:42:42.134]  Let's look at
[02:42:43.575 --> 02:42:45.996]  The Pentagon is brained by Annie Jacobson.
[02:42:46.456 --> 02:42:52.999]  She says that the way that DARPA comes to be, and if you don't know, DARPA or ARPANET is where the internet comes from, right?
[02:42:53.019 --> 02:42:59.582]  So the internet used to be ARPA, and then it became ARPANET, and then it became DARPANET, and then it became the internet.
[02:43:00.382 --> 02:43:04.864]  And the roots of this obviously are the Cold War and the Rand Corporation and all that,
[02:43:05.788 --> 02:43:08.970]  There was a key test lab, which was Vietnam.
[02:43:09.050 --> 02:43:13.634]  Now, listen to me very carefully, because every time I talk about this, people misunderstand.
[02:43:13.654 --> 02:43:21.539]  They think I'm saying communism is good, and you know, it's not that America is the bad guy, communism is the good guy, or vice versa.
[02:43:21.599 --> 02:43:31.066]  It's that there's a technocratic elite that sits above systems that uses war as a test lab for R&D, for research and development.
[02:43:31.958 --> 02:43:40.566]  And this is what she's really hitting at in this book, is talking about how the Vietnam War was a gigantic test lab for drugs, right?
[02:43:40.646 --> 02:43:44.629]  What could be done with, number one, experimenting on troops with certain drugs.
[02:43:45.390 --> 02:43:48.673]  This is why you have so many troops coming back with addictions and whatnot.
[02:43:48.733 --> 02:43:49.834]  That was intentional.
[02:43:50.749 --> 02:43:54.211]  You have the experimentations with what's called ethnography, right?
[02:43:54.231 --> 02:43:56.192]  And this is what the CIA would do.
[02:43:56.312 --> 02:44:04.017]  You know, really any empire in the history of the world, any state, has done a kind of ethnography where they would study the cultures and the people groups that they wanted to conquer.
[02:44:05.018 --> 02:44:15.484]  But this became a perfected science in the 20th century and the CIA got really good at doing ethnography where they would send people in undercover, right, as archaeologists and this kind of stuff.
[02:44:15.504 --> 02:44:17.245]  They were actually doing research for the CIA.
[02:44:18.300 --> 02:44:21.221]  And what they would do is they would figure out everything to do with some culture.
[02:44:21.642 --> 02:44:29.325]  They would learn their mannerisms, their idiosyncrasies, their dialects, their weird, you know, whatever was unique to that culture.
[02:44:29.345 --> 02:44:34.508]  And they would have a complete profile to then manipulate that people group.
[02:44:35.428 --> 02:44:40.671]  And so, if you know, I've covered Miles Copeland's famous book, Game of Nations, that was his job, right?
[02:44:40.711 --> 02:44:42.792]  His job was to go in as a consultant
[02:44:43.416 --> 02:44:48.078]  For the, quote, ad companies, which was really his CIA cover.
[02:44:48.118 --> 02:44:59.642]  He was doing a consultation for the CIA to first Syria, the leaders in Syria, and then to Nasser during the Cold War.
[02:45:00.323 --> 02:45:09.006]  And Copeland was very honest in his book that this was all really to learn about how to manipulate nations, the game of nations.
[02:45:10.006 --> 02:45:18.693]  And so, Jacobson goes on to talk about some of the things that were pioneered in Vietnam that you wouldn't expect would be the usage of tracking and tracing through computers.
[02:45:19.453 --> 02:45:28.320]  So, I think everybody knows about IBM and, you know, the Holocaust and tracking people through that kind of stuff with cards, but here it becomes automated, right?
[02:45:28.761 --> 02:45:34.425]  In the Vietnam War, the CIA and DARPA were testing on
[02:45:35.373 --> 02:45:36.274]  Thai soldiers.
[02:45:36.954 --> 02:45:43.097]  They would take Thai soldiers at the behest of the king of Thailand or whatever, who was some kind of a CIA asset, I'm sure.
[02:45:43.958 --> 02:45:51.482]  And they were recording and surveilling and trying to figure out who was loyal to the regime and who wasn't during this conflict.
[02:45:52.923 --> 02:45:56.865]  Other things that they would do is to perfect drones.
[02:45:57.365 --> 02:46:00.027]  Drone warfare was actually perfected in Vietnam
[02:46:01.045 --> 02:46:09.929]  And not only drone warfare and using drones in Vietnam on unmanned aerial vehicles, but they would also experiment with chemical spraying.
[02:46:10.689 --> 02:46:22.613]  Yes, Agent Orange was actually a weather modification bio-warfare attack, right, where there's a guy named Gordon McDonald who was part of the Jason Society.
[02:46:22.693 --> 02:46:26.575]  The Jason Society is one of these elite scientific societies and
[02:46:27.228 --> 02:46:38.275]  Again, what RAND and what DARPA are doing is basically recruiting the top engineers, the top scientists, to work on projects that a lot of these scientists didn't even know what they were doing.
[02:46:38.295 --> 02:46:42.058]  They were just told, you know, we need you to do this and perfect this drone to do this and this.
[02:46:42.778 --> 02:46:49.323]  And really, it's only these top technocrats that know what all of the compartmentalization, right, is all about, right?
[02:46:49.343 --> 02:46:50.884]  So, they know the full picture
[02:46:51.670 --> 02:46:55.091]  And a lot of the scientists and a lot of the soldiers, they don't have a clue, right?
[02:46:55.171 --> 02:47:04.234]  Even people on the ground commanding the soldiers, they don't know the full game plan that the Vietnam War is this big research and development test lab.
[02:47:04.695 --> 02:47:09.096]  That's mind-blowing to me, that that's what was going on here.
[02:47:09.136 --> 02:47:19.760]  The Viet Cong, this is an important point she makes, were being studied by RAND to see how they interacted and reacted to a lot of the different movements that the West would make, right?
[02:47:20.956 --> 02:47:24.037]  There's actually a lot of movies that kind of hint at this, believe it or not, right?
[02:47:24.057 --> 02:47:26.717]  There's the Apocalypse Now, right?
[02:47:27.057 --> 02:47:29.218]  There's Full Metal Jacket, right?
[02:47:29.238 --> 02:47:32.499]  These movies kind of hint that maybe something else was going on here, right?
[02:47:32.739 --> 02:47:33.599]  Oliver Stone, right?
[02:47:33.619 --> 02:47:36.119]  He's made great films that talk about this kind of stuff.
[02:47:37.040 --> 02:47:38.860]  And so the Viet Cong were being studied by RAND.
[02:47:38.880 --> 02:47:41.501]  They were being studied by the Deep State, you could say.
[02:47:42.541 --> 02:47:46.482]  And they learned what to do to move masses of population.
[02:47:46.622 --> 02:47:48.102]  They actually had a Hamlet program.
[02:47:48.820 --> 02:48:00.149]  This is a mass relocation program to see what were the easiest ways, the simplest ways to relocate masses of people into new living situations.
[02:48:00.209 --> 02:48:08.235]  How do we get indigenous peoples, in this case, to reorganize their societies and reorient in a way that's favorable to America?
[02:48:08.335 --> 02:48:10.517]  It's the Strategic Hamlet Program, exactly.
[02:48:12.597 --> 02:48:22.240]  So are we starting to see a pattern here of mass social engineering, studying the people group through ethnography, using drones, using weather warfare.
[02:48:22.281 --> 02:48:25.502]  There was actually a program of the weather warfare that was related.
[02:48:25.542 --> 02:48:27.863]  It was called Project Emote, E-M-O-T-E.
[02:48:27.883 --> 02:48:28.723]  I think that's what it was.
[02:48:29.503 --> 02:48:38.306]  And Project Emote was about using weather weapons on the Viet Cong to start forest fires combined with the biowarfare of spraying Agent Orange.
[02:48:39.687 --> 02:48:40.187]  Spraying
[02:48:41.172 --> 02:48:44.177]  Chemical spraying from the sky, weather warfare, right?
[02:48:44.537 --> 02:48:48.684]  And again, Gordon MacDonald, Dr. Edward Teller, Jay Conant.
[02:48:48.904 --> 02:48:54.513]  These are all guys who worked on these projects that were connected in these same high-level Jason Society circles.
[02:48:55.100 --> 02:49:00.381]  And in fact, it's Dr. Edward Teller of the Manhattan Project, who is the father of large-scale geoengineering.
[02:49:00.741 --> 02:49:04.462]  That's even in public science, like mainstream science.
[02:49:04.482 --> 02:49:09.722]  I don't remember if it was Science McMahon or somewhere, but they talk about the fact that that's what Dr. Edward Teller was up to.
[02:49:09.742 --> 02:49:10.203]  There he is.
[02:49:10.403 --> 02:49:14.943]  There's film scenes of the spraying being done in Vietnam.
[02:49:15.003 --> 02:49:18.624]  So this was all part of a climate and weather manipulation.
[02:49:19.524 --> 02:49:20.524]  And a lot of people don't know that.
[02:49:20.584 --> 02:49:24.285]  They think, oh, it was just, you know, the government was testing different chemicals on the troops.
[02:49:25.029 --> 02:49:26.150]  It was much more than that.
[02:49:26.230 --> 02:49:34.137]  So, what they did, this is the amazing part, she says that this was the first implementation of a systems of systems approach, right?
[02:49:34.157 --> 02:49:39.962]  So, we know about systems studies, you know, studies of how a system works together.
[02:49:39.982 --> 02:49:40.462]  It could be anything.
[02:49:40.482 --> 02:49:41.603]  It could be a computer system.
[02:49:41.623 --> 02:49:42.924]  It could be an economic system.
[02:49:43.525 --> 02:49:51.512]  Well, this is a meta-level integration of many systems together in Vietnam that included the population relocation,
[02:49:52.294 --> 02:49:52.474]  Right.
[02:49:52.535 --> 02:49:53.500]  The Hamlet project.
[02:49:53.661 --> 02:49:56.073]  It included things like the Phoenix program.
[02:49:57.000 --> 02:50:06.683]  Which, if you don't know about that, Douglas Valentine, Dave McGowan have some great books that discuss the Phoenix Program, which was the intention to create serial killers, basically, right?
[02:50:06.763 --> 02:50:12.644]  Train high-level killers during the Vietnam War to go out and, you know, we think about war movies.
[02:50:12.704 --> 02:50:17.025]  I think Dolph Lundgren's in some war movie where he's like a Phoenix Program guy with a bunch of ears.
[02:50:17.065 --> 02:50:18.666]  He's wearing a necklace of ears, right?
[02:50:18.686 --> 02:50:20.786]  I forget what, it's a Van Damme movie or something.
[02:50:20.806 --> 02:50:23.007]  But that's hinting at this point as well, which is,
[02:50:23.567 --> 02:50:24.208]  We're good to go.
[02:50:44.898 --> 02:50:45.779]  Weather modification.
[02:50:46.399 --> 02:50:48.680]  The electronic fence system.
[02:50:48.720 --> 02:50:53.023]  This is another one that they invented, which was beginning to use sensors and AI.
[02:50:53.483 --> 02:51:02.189]  I mean, it wasn't the sophisticated AI that we think of today, but basically just sensors that would set off bombs and that were relayed, the signals relayed back to drones.
[02:51:02.952 --> 02:51:15.121]  And so she says this is really the beginning of trying to integrate in the battlefield a holistic picture of everything going on, right, that could be tracked and traced from central war room locations, right?
[02:51:15.621 --> 02:51:17.583]  Now, think about this.
[02:51:17.683 --> 02:51:22.306]  So there's so many layers and levels to this that it's kind of mind blowing, really.
[02:51:23.121 --> 02:51:33.468]  And when you think about the fact that it's a systems of systems approach, you can begin to see how this is exactly what was studied to know how to do this to mass populations, right?
[02:51:33.988 --> 02:51:41.773]  You can use these same techniques and principles, not just in a region or in some area in the future, in a color revolution or whatever.
[02:51:41.793 --> 02:51:49.178]  Because remember, it's, you know, the same people behind color revolutions, the same people behind those kinds of regime change operations that we're studying this stuff, right?
[02:51:49.898 --> 02:51:50.959]  It's the same thing, right?
[02:51:50.999 --> 02:51:59.223]  You can do this on a mass scale, and that's where we get the basic principles and patterns of what the technocracy does nowadays.
[02:51:59.863 --> 02:52:03.965]  So it wasn't even really in the long term about winning or losing the Vietnam War.
[02:52:04.005 --> 02:52:08.768]  I think there was a lot of psychological warfare in terms of demoralization of the American public through Vietnam.
[02:52:08.788 --> 02:52:09.708]  That was a big part of it.
[02:52:10.429 --> 02:52:12.650]  But ultimately, it was about the technocracy.
[02:52:13.130 --> 02:52:14.791]  That's what this was really about.
[02:52:14.851 --> 02:52:16.652]  And that's crucial to see and to understand.
[02:52:17.668 --> 02:52:20.449]  We'll close this up in the final segment when we get back.
[02:52:20.529 --> 02:52:28.470]  This is the Alex Jones Show and I'm Jake Dyer.
[02:52:28.490 --> 02:52:31.551]  X2 is an essential nutrient.
[02:52:32.191 --> 02:52:36.872]  It is clean, pure atomic iodine from 12,000 foot deep crystals.
[02:52:37.553 --> 02:52:39.433]  There's a byproduct of oil and gas drilling.
[02:52:40.677 --> 02:52:45.139]  We're the only ones to ever go out and actually get this type of true, pure, atomic iodine.
[02:52:45.179 --> 02:52:46.779]  We have to get a DEA license to get it.
[02:52:47.099 --> 02:52:47.539]  It's crazy.
[02:52:47.559 --> 02:52:48.920]  It goes right into your cells.
[02:52:48.980 --> 02:52:49.680]  It's essential.
[02:52:50.160 --> 02:52:53.842]  It's the good halogen, the opposite of fluoride and bromide and bromine and all of that.
[02:52:54.322 --> 02:52:55.702]  Look into the iodine conspiracy.
[02:52:55.722 --> 02:52:56.743]  This is the best you're going to get.
[02:52:57.583 --> 02:52:58.404]  It's back in stock.
[02:52:58.784 --> 02:52:59.885]  X2 sold out for months.
[02:52:59.905 --> 02:53:01.526]  50% off.
[02:53:01.566 --> 02:53:02.407]  People are very excited.
[02:53:02.867 --> 02:53:05.329]  Also back in stock after eight months because the COVID lockdown.
[02:53:05.549 --> 02:53:06.450]  Couldn't get it from France.
[02:53:07.070 --> 02:53:07.671]  Pollen Block.
[02:53:07.771 --> 02:53:09.332]  It's from specially fed quail.
[02:53:09.812 --> 02:53:11.573]  Their eggs have this natural antihistamine.
[02:53:12.034 --> 02:53:12.574]  It's amazing.
[02:53:12.614 --> 02:53:13.135]  People love it.
[02:53:14.496 --> 02:53:16.078]  It gives you that anti-allergy effect.
[02:53:16.258 --> 02:53:22.765]  Also, back in stock is our fluoride-free concentrated charcoal, activated charcoal toothpaste that my dad developed.
[02:53:22.785 --> 02:53:23.626]  He's a retired dentist.
[02:53:23.746 --> 02:53:26.188]  I want to thank you all for shopping with us and supporting us.
[02:53:26.429 --> 02:53:27.650]  Without you, we will not be on air.
[02:53:43.206 --> 02:53:47.329]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[02:53:47.769 --> 02:53:49.570]  Let's go ahead and talk to Diana in Michigan.
[02:53:49.590 --> 02:53:50.631]  You're on the air, thanks for holding.
[02:53:50.711 --> 02:53:51.011]  Hello.
[02:53:51.131 --> 02:53:51.872]  Hi, welcome.
[02:53:51.932 --> 02:54:01.578]  Okay, I want to plug your InfoWars mask, although I know that we are all against masks and that it's just basically a symbol of, you know, conformity and enslavement.
[02:54:01.718 --> 02:54:09.863]  I want to say, every time I go out wearing it, when I go out to, you know, shops and grocery stores and whatnot, at least one person, every single time, compliments me on the mask.
[02:54:09.963 --> 02:54:11.624]  And they're like, oh Alex Jones, I love him.
[02:54:11.684 --> 02:54:19.768]  And then I let them know, go to band.video, B-A-N-N-E-D.video, because sometimes when I say band.video, they think B-A-N-D.
[02:54:19.869 --> 02:54:24.751]  So I make sure to clarify that, but almost every single time I go out, I get compliments on that.
[02:54:24.791 --> 02:54:28.714]  So it's definitely spreading the word, and you know, so it doesn't inhibit my breathing.
[02:54:28.734 --> 02:54:31.015]  I wear it underneath my nose, and it's kind of like, let's
[02:54:31.155 --> 02:54:33.516]  People know that I don't really believe in the mask either.
[02:54:33.576 --> 02:54:34.997]  I'm wearing it just because I have to.
[02:54:35.017 --> 02:54:37.258]  I live in Governor Whitmer's horrible state.
[02:54:37.298 --> 02:54:51.085]  But I do want to say that I did see one other person wear it at first earlier this year when you first came out with it, and I literally got brought to tears because I saw another person that believes like I do, and I didn't feel all alone out in this world.
[02:54:51.305 --> 02:54:56.348]  And it meant so much to me to see someone taking action, so I went ahead and ordered one for myself.
[02:54:56.608 --> 02:55:00.770]  And I swear to God, and I just had a baby too on the 7th of December.
[02:55:00.990 --> 02:55:01.510]  Oh, congratulations!
[02:55:01.550 --> 02:55:04.892]  And I was like, word mastering the whole time of, you know, like, when I was in the hospital.
[02:55:05.092 --> 02:55:10.934]  And I just had to make sure that I'm putting that message out there, and it really makes an impact.
[02:55:10.995 --> 02:55:22.980]  And we, like, have big long conversations with, like, the workers at these different grocery stores and other customers and stuff, and it really is a feeling of empowerment to see that there are other people out there thinking like you, that you're not all alone.
[02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:27.722]  So even though I don't believe in the mask, it's a great statement to get it out there to the rest of the world.
[02:55:27.742 --> 02:55:29.544]  Anna, I'm so glad you got through.
[02:55:29.604 --> 02:55:34.047]  God bless you and congratulations on that new wonderful life that you have brought into the world.
[02:55:34.448 --> 02:55:35.829]  And I only wish the best for your new baby.
[02:55:36.770 --> 02:55:44.976]  I'm glad she called because this is bigger than Alex Jones and this is one of my frustration points in my mind that people don't seem to get.
[02:55:44.996 --> 02:55:51.042]  And when I've in general talked about Pharisees, I'm not talking about any particular individual.
[02:55:51.982 --> 02:55:54.725]  I'm talking about the way a Pharisee brain works is
[02:55:56.255 --> 02:55:57.376]  Very one-dimensional.
[02:55:57.416 --> 02:56:01.078]  Like, you say the masks are a fraud and cause bacterial pneumonia.
[02:56:01.438 --> 02:56:02.559]  You say they don't protect you.
[02:56:02.599 --> 02:56:04.099]  You say they're a symbol of slavery.
[02:56:04.199 --> 02:56:06.461]  Then what are you doing selling masks?
[02:56:06.641 --> 02:56:21.589]  Well, when we launched them, I made the decision to print it with Infowars.com so if you're on a plane or in a restaurant where it's a private place and they're making you do it and you need to go there for whatever reason, you wear it to fight back and then use the abuse like a judo move.
[02:56:21.889 --> 02:56:24.771]  They attack you, you use their momentum to throw them through the wall.
[02:56:29.525 --> 02:56:41.354]  Separately, you remember me in the last six months ahead of the election saying we're trying to sell all the products out at discount prices because we're not going to even have that much stuff in the warehouse in the new year because if Biden steals the election, they plan to shut us down.
[02:56:41.954 --> 02:56:43.155]  Well, you now see that all over the news.
[02:56:43.495 --> 02:56:44.396]  Arrest Alex Jones.
[02:56:44.436 --> 02:56:45.376]  Shut Alex Jones down.
[02:56:46.377 --> 02:56:53.205]  That's why if you want to go to InfoWarsTore.com and get a t-shirt or get a book or get the supplements, I would suggest you stock up now.
[02:56:53.666 --> 02:57:02.116]  We need to bring in as much money as we can to operate into the future if we have our banking taking away, which they've already done at many levels, but now they're closing in for the full takeover and
[02:57:02.176 --> 02:57:02.876]  And look, don't worry.
[02:57:02.916 --> 02:57:03.817]  You'll be joining me.
[02:57:03.917 --> 02:57:05.237]  They plan to never turn the U.S.
[02:57:05.277 --> 02:57:06.078]  economy back on.
[02:57:06.198 --> 02:57:07.558]  Never take their boot off your neck.
[02:57:07.618 --> 02:57:08.078]  The U.S.
[02:57:08.238 --> 02:57:09.799]  is slated for total destruction.
[02:57:09.879 --> 02:57:15.281]  Now, there may still be time to turn this around, but I just want you to know, in what could be some of our last broadcast here, where this is going.
[02:57:15.401 --> 02:57:18.302]  If I was you, we've got 2020 prices on storable food.
[02:57:18.322 --> 02:57:20.303]  The prices, they've extended until Friday.
[02:57:20.383 --> 02:57:21.143]  Then they will go up.
[02:57:21.243 --> 02:57:22.884]  People are buying through an explosive rate.
[02:57:22.964 --> 02:57:24.485]  Go to preparewithalex.com.
[02:57:24.605 --> 02:57:28.026]  That takes you right to the sub-page of infowarstore.com, where you'll find
[02:57:28.246 --> 02:57:32.911]  The best deals in the industry on high quality, fresh, durable food the last 25 years with great packaging.
[02:57:32.991 --> 02:57:34.253]  Preparewithalex.com.
[02:57:34.413 --> 02:57:35.834]  One year supplies up to $850 off.
[02:57:35.854 --> 02:57:40.039]  Last year's prices and discounts, it will go up, I'm told, one way or another.
[02:57:40.159 --> 02:57:41.781]  Next Saturday, it's extended through Friday.
[02:57:41.861 --> 02:57:43.262]  Preparewithalex.com.
[02:57:43.363 --> 02:57:44.183]  Preparewithalex.com.
[02:57:44.684 --> 02:57:44.824]  I think.
[02:58:08.328 --> 02:58:08.748]  I think so.
