[00:00:00.129 --> 00:00:03.390]  Understand, they're going to be whipped into a fury that it's our fault they're dying.
[00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:05.551]  That was baked in from the beginning.
[00:00:07.031 --> 00:00:15.074]  So, as much as we love these people, we need to be Christ-like, we also need to be very stern with them when they try to blame us for the fact that they're dead and dying.
[00:00:15.934 --> 00:00:17.635]  Or their children are dying, or their parents are dying.
[00:00:18.515 --> 00:00:20.916]  So, it's going to be a hellish winter, and it's going to get even worse.
[00:00:21.636 --> 00:00:24.677]  We're going to try to make the injections totally mandatory once the mass death begins.
[00:00:25.647 --> 00:00:28.207]   And big text in a sense for anybody that tries to tell the truth.
[00:00:28.207 --> 00:00:31.326]  So our worst analysis has been proven accurate.
[00:00:31.326 --> 00:00:33.487]  And the super cold is here.
[00:00:33.487 --> 00:00:34.448]  And that's what they're going to call it.
[00:00:34.448 --> 00:00:37.087]  The UK is the headquarters of this, along with Australia.
[00:00:37.087 --> 00:00:38.048]  It's from the same people.
[00:00:38.048 --> 00:00:40.688]  And notice everything that happens there comes here.
[00:00:40.688 --> 00:00:42.927]  So the beta test is it's going to be called the super cold.
[00:00:42.927 --> 00:00:47.567]   And they're not going to tell you that it's COVID because, oh, you've had the vaccine.
[00:00:47.567 --> 00:00:48.768]  So you can't get sick from COVID.
[00:00:48.972 --> 00:00:50.032]  Oh, you're sick from something else.
[00:00:50.692 --> 00:00:58.994]  Whereas it's the vaccine and it's the antibody crisis that's happening, the antibody-dependent enhancement, ADE.
[00:00:59.034 --> 00:01:01.294]  So we told you thousands of times it was coming.
[00:01:01.354 --> 00:01:02.854]  All the literature, in fact, showed that.
[00:01:03.634 --> 00:01:04.415]  And now here we are.
[00:01:04.575 --> 00:01:06.155]  It's called the super cold.
[00:01:07.015 --> 00:01:08.855]  The super cold is here right on time.
[00:01:09.776 --> 00:01:14.409]   And it's time we get Dr. Terry Tenpinning and others Back on the show who predicted all this.
[00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:16.812]  It's time we get all those clips of them predicting it.
[00:01:17.653 --> 00:01:22.979]  A year and a half ago, a year ago, and then we show it to people because that's one of the few things that can wake these sheep up.
[00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:27.904]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.602]  It's Thursday, October 14th, 2021.
[00:01:34.762 --> 00:01:37.244]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:01:37.284 --> 00:01:45.911]  I'll be co-hosting today with Owen Schroer who's in studio in Austin, Texas, and I'll be back tomorrow in studio in Austin, Texas.
[00:01:47.312 --> 00:01:50.315]  There's obviously a lot of incredibly important news to cover.
[00:01:50.335 --> 00:01:59.282]  A lot of important news and information the establishment either doesn't want you to know or information they want to put out first with their spin and their deception added to it.
[00:02:00.811 --> 00:02:16.016]  But I think before I get into all of these really earth shaking events that have been unfolding, like the British government's own vaccine surveillance system coming out two days ago, we reported on it yesterday.
[00:02:17.344 --> 00:02:31.931]  And confirming that the vast majority of people that are hospitalized and who are dying have been, quote, vaccinated against COVID-19, and that you are, quote, twice as likely to contract COVID-19 if you've had the vaccine.
[00:02:32.731 --> 00:02:45.401]   As our top experts said over a year and a half ago in the air, countless epidemiologists, virologists, scientists, medical doctors, that once a large portion of the public took the shot, the
[00:02:45.401 --> 00:02:50.150]   establishment would then claim, the social engineers would then claim, that it was the unvaccinated
[00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.560]  making the vaccinated sick.
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.161]   Now you had to murder logic on many fronts there and say, "Well, wait, I thought you were
[00:02:57.161 --> 00:03:01.241]   protected because you had the vaccine." So they said, "Well, you just won't get as sick." And
[00:03:01.241 --> 00:03:05.800]   now they say, "Well, you do get more sick, but you just need a booster and it'll protect you,
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.600]  even though the Israeli studies say it does nothing."
[00:03:08.861 --> 00:03:09.741]  Except make you sicker.
[00:03:10.322 --> 00:03:11.603]  But what did all the experts say?
[00:03:11.663 --> 00:03:25.071]  They said injecting somebody with a spike protein and programming the body to produce said spike protein that makes you sick will actually cause you to test positive for COVID and have COVID-like symptoms but at a greater level.
[00:03:26.352 --> 00:03:31.215]  Now, it doesn't take an epidemiologist or virologist or top scientist or pathologist to tell you that.
[00:03:31.695 --> 00:03:33.136]  But that's, who's said that?
[00:03:34.537 --> 00:03:50.352]  You know, four months ago, the Head German Pathology Association, you know, the coroners, they came out and said they're seeing a more than doubling of all different types of cancers and of blood clots and heart attacks.
[00:03:50.412 --> 00:03:56.398]  It's overall, they said, a doubling in the number of people that they would see dying from those things.
[00:03:56.898 --> 00:03:57.519]  You can look that up.
[00:03:58.826 --> 00:03:59.647]  Oh, but don't worry.
[00:03:59.827 --> 00:04:04.191]  Facebook and Twitter and YouTube and Google and all the rest of it censor that when it comes out.
[00:04:04.211 --> 00:04:05.952]  There's articles we'll cover coming up where...
[00:04:06.963 --> 00:04:15.025]  More top scientists have gone public, but also bioethics individuals have gone public, heads of universities, other bioethics departments have gone public.
[00:04:15.505 --> 00:04:16.925]  Now it's 12, I count, in the U.S.
[00:04:16.965 --> 00:04:17.245]  alone.
[00:04:18.025 --> 00:04:19.046]  And you know what happens to them?
[00:04:19.226 --> 00:04:21.066]  They're either fired or put on administrative leave.
[00:04:21.526 --> 00:04:30.368]  Because this is all an exercise in gaslighting, in getting people to rationalize and make excuses for what's happening and just accept being soft-killed.
[00:04:31.522 --> 00:04:36.944]  I've always told you they would hit you with a weak virus and then they would start putting out stronger viruses.
[00:04:37.844 --> 00:04:44.146]  Then they would also claim that the vaccine you were taking was protecting you and that other people who weren't vaccinated were hurting you.
[00:04:44.466 --> 00:04:46.107]  And again, we've been over these lies over and over again.
[00:04:47.667 --> 00:04:49.228]  But now we're living it.
[00:04:50.528 --> 00:04:51.829]  Now we're right in the middle of it.
[00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:58.711]  And there's that John Hopkins data put out last week from over 100 countries with the same numbers.
[00:04:59.893 --> 00:05:01.354]  Massively more likely to get sick.
[00:05:01.415 --> 00:05:02.876]  Massively more likely to be in the hospital.
[00:05:02.936 --> 00:05:04.938]  Massively more likely to die.
[00:05:05.758 --> 00:05:19.214]   And now the British government's Own analysis comes out, and we had the article yesterday with a link directly to the British government's own data site, and I saw commenters on Bandot Video saying, where's the proof?
[00:05:19.294 --> 00:05:19.855]  I don't see it.
[00:05:20.636 --> 00:05:22.077]  Folks, those aren't regular commenters.
[00:05:22.117 --> 00:05:37.730]  Those are people coming in, hoping you don't go read the documents, and hoping you just think that the information isn't there, because that's the only hope they've got now, is telling you that nothing bad is happening, telling you nothing's going on, so you just go back to sleep so they can quietly kill you.
[00:05:39.375 --> 00:05:44.357]  It's just unbelievable to be at this level of society and civilization.
[00:05:44.377 --> 00:05:44.957]  Again, I'm going to say it.
[00:05:46.458 --> 00:05:47.279]  We are in a trance.
[00:05:47.679 --> 00:05:49.299]  Humanity must awaken from the trance.
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.760]  We must get out of the trance if we have any future.
[00:05:52.421 --> 00:05:55.022]  And we must go to the John Hopkins zone data.
[00:05:55.402 --> 00:05:57.823]  And we must go to the British government zone data.
[00:05:58.303 --> 00:06:00.264]  And we must see it there for ourselves.
[00:06:01.225 --> 00:06:02.745]  Twice as likely to get sick.
[00:06:03.706 --> 00:06:05.947]  More likely to be hospitalized and die.
[00:06:05.967 --> 00:06:08.448]  And it's the same numbers from around the world.
[00:06:10.077 --> 00:06:17.803]  I'm going to have both articles on the British Medical Journal, on the British Medical Reports, on the British Medical Tracking System, and John Hopkins today.
[00:06:19.184 --> 00:06:19.824]  We'll be right back.
[00:06:19.844 --> 00:06:20.264]  Stay with us.
[00:06:20.284 --> 00:06:20.965]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:06:21.025 --> 00:06:23.187]  This is the Infowar, Infowars.com.
[00:06:23.227 --> 00:06:24.367]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:06:25.268 --> 00:06:39.711]   If you had to have one unifying statement to describe what the globalists are building, what their worldview is, what their goal is, It's anti-human.
[00:06:40.532 --> 00:06:41.272]  It's post-human.
[00:06:42.533 --> 00:06:50.456]  It hates the very nature of what makes us strong, what makes us happy, what makes us healthy, what makes us thrive.
[00:06:51.637 --> 00:06:53.538]  But it's not just fundamentally anti-human.
[00:06:54.738 --> 00:07:02.932]   Oh, this system Tells us in so many messages in so many ways every day that it's the guardian of the earth.
[00:07:03.853 --> 00:07:05.034]  That it loves the planet.
[00:07:05.054 --> 00:07:08.637]  That it's going to save the whales and the birds and the bees.
[00:07:09.878 --> 00:07:29.691]   But when you pull back into the actual writings of the futurist, of the high priest of this system, They tell you we are going to become gods, and this earth is nothing to us, and we would destroy the whole universe if that's what it took for us to ascend to godhood.
[00:07:31.292 --> 00:07:36.374]  It's in my full men game, the quotes by the individuals who are the high priests of the system.
[00:07:36.414 --> 00:07:47.498]  Remember four years ago, Elon Musk famously said, beware those who talk of AI gods, and beware of those who worship AI gods.
[00:07:48.939 --> 00:07:50.500]  Because they worship themselves.
[00:07:52.402 --> 00:08:02.229]  And they see humanity's destruction as the toll to the boatman Charon to take them into their Valhalla or their heaven, which is our hell.
[00:08:04.391 --> 00:08:10.916]  Now I've got a lot of really important news to cover on this Thursday, October 14th transmission.
[00:08:13.558 --> 00:08:22.707]   But before I lay out the latest earth-shaking developments, I want to talk about the big picture and the 35,000 foot view.
[00:08:24.647 --> 00:08:37.033]  Because if you're going to describe the system we're facing, this has to burn into your psyche and really etch itself into your awareness and your consciousness.
[00:08:37.753 --> 00:08:52.558]   Not just if you want to be free, not just if you want to survive a couple years, not just if you want to Have any future but if you don't want your very will, your very essence, your very soul that is quite real absorbed and overwritten by this.
[00:08:53.799 --> 00:09:14.751]   We're talking about your eternal wish, your eternal choice that all of us are making right now and as the evil, as the anti-life system Pushes out and dominates and manifests itself in its attack, in its ravenous hunger.
[00:09:16.532 --> 00:09:18.153]  So here is the big statement.
[00:09:18.974 --> 00:09:19.955]  And I want it to sink in.
[00:09:20.935 --> 00:09:25.038]  And I want you to ponder it at a cellular level and at a spiritual gut level.
[00:09:26.219 --> 00:09:27.680]  Deep down, you know it's true.
[00:09:29.081 --> 00:09:34.225]  What we face, if you had to describe it as one word, I said I'd describe it as one word, but I didn't.
[00:09:35.065 --> 00:09:36.046]  Because I haven't described it yet.
[00:09:37.207 --> 00:09:40.646]   The one word Is alien.
[00:09:42.527 --> 00:09:43.107]  Alien.
[00:09:43.567 --> 00:09:46.589]  Not of this world.
[00:09:48.350 --> 00:10:32.484]   Just as all the ancient texts and hieroglyphs tell us, just as the Bible tells us, just as the ancient Jewish annals tell us, that a system not of this world seeks to eradicate us and to remove us Because it hates what planted us here, because we are made in the image of that, and are able, on a little G level, not the big G level, not the original gangsta level, but on the little baby G level, to build whatever we can imagine as we've now seen manifests.
[00:10:33.775 --> 00:10:49.900]  And so there is a race by collaborators who are working with that fallen ancient spirit, that ancient energy, that ancient consciousness, that ancient will, Satan.
[00:10:51.141 --> 00:10:56.362]  And he has promised his minions exactly what the Bible said he would promise them.
[00:10:57.183 --> 00:11:07.047]   Eternal life, knowledge of the universe, Sharing with him, with it, the power of God.
[00:11:08.748 --> 00:11:12.730]  But first, they must take the general population's free will.
[00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:16.792]  They must attack children, which are the seed of the universe.
[00:11:18.573 --> 00:11:27.757]  And we must commit horrible crimes against the great architect's will.
[00:11:30.037 --> 00:11:37.760]  When I say great architect, you're going to see all the anti-Masonic groups out there saying, oh, Jones is using code words for the Masons.
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:42.241]  No, ladies and gentlemen, the Bible talks about God's architecture being seen in the stars.
[00:11:42.801 --> 00:11:47.683]  Everything the Illuminati does is steal all God's terms, then use them themselves.
[00:11:48.263 --> 00:11:52.224]  And then when we try to reappropriate God's language, the fools say we're of the devil.
[00:11:52.724 --> 00:11:53.945]  You judge a tree by its fruits.
[00:11:55.163 --> 00:11:57.564]  A sun rising symbol is not satanic.
[00:11:57.704 --> 00:11:58.444]  God did that.
[00:11:58.664 --> 00:12:00.064]  That's a symbol of the new day.
[00:12:01.124 --> 00:12:02.705]  The swastika is not an evil symbol.
[00:12:02.745 --> 00:12:09.626]  It's the symbol of motion and the sun rolling through the heavens and rolling across the mountain ranges in every culture.
[00:12:10.186 --> 00:12:11.046]  It's a good symbol.
[00:12:11.206 --> 00:12:13.067]  Just because Hitler took it doesn't mean it's bad.
[00:12:14.647 --> 00:12:16.287]  And so forth and so on.
[00:12:16.527 --> 00:12:17.247]  But I digress.
[00:12:17.267 --> 00:12:19.808]  That's just a small piece of information.
[00:12:21.894 --> 00:12:27.019]  So here we are, ladies and gentlemen, at this key crossroads, going to this great decision.
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:30.762]  And we see all these debates out there.
[00:12:31.943 --> 00:12:36.207]  The so-called conservatives on one end, and the so-called liberal leftists on the other.
[00:12:38.089 --> 00:12:41.412]  And if you look at what a conservative is today, that would be a liberal ten years ago.
[00:12:43.300 --> 00:13:04.358]  And it's all being directed by the big corporations and the big banks and high-tech PR firms and brigades of behavioral psychologists and psychiatrists on record doing focus groups on every facet of our lives on ways to convince us and control us to turn over control of ourselves and our children and our destinies to them.
[00:13:04.699 --> 00:13:05.619]  They admit all this!
[00:13:06.513 --> 00:13:12.839]  They talk like we're little kids at the kids table and they're the big adults at the big table and we don't know what they're talking about.
[00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:18.324]  Or as the analogy I used yesterday, it's like they're Martians speaking in their language and think we can't hear them.
[00:13:19.085 --> 00:13:25.091]  And all I'm trying to get people to do is to understand they keep you in these controlled paradigms of limited debate.
[00:13:25.191 --> 00:13:26.732]  You know the term, get outside the box.
[00:13:27.753 --> 00:13:30.235]  And they keep you within the allegory of the cave.
[00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:57.046]  They keep you within a system and feed you what input they want and then the whole debate is a controlled debate where they've already moved the Overton window to the area they want and then simply by having controlled opposition that isn't even conscious of the fact that they will cover limited aspects of it but never bring you to the great truth of the fact that this is an alien attack and that it's hiding in plain view.
[00:13:58.166 --> 00:14:24.142]   And so all of it is focusing on the symptoms and not the heart of the matter of the fact that we have to have a spiritual solution and we have to see beyond the five senses and we have to make that sixth sense connection and transcend our spirit that is already transcended into the higher realms and that by denying those higher realms we allow
[00:14:25.118 --> 00:14:31.518]   anti-liberty forces in the universe to manipulate and control us because we are denying the existence of
[00:14:31.518 --> 00:14:38.858]   these very energetic systems like a Person jumping into a river that has a horrible riptide in
[00:14:38.858 --> 00:14:42.297]   it and being pulled under you couldn't see the currents under the water
[00:14:42.297 --> 00:14:47.278]   But they were there and that's why you see the spiritual blindness. That's why you see the lostness
[00:14:47.278 --> 00:14:51.418]   That's why you see the confusion. It's why you see the system promising to its slaves
[00:14:51.957 --> 00:14:56.957]   just conform more to all of this anti God anti human garbage and
[00:14:56.957 --> 00:15:02.074]   Somehow will build a utopia But they're not building a utopia.
[00:15:02.114 --> 00:15:03.074]  They're building a dystopia.
[00:15:03.114 --> 00:15:03.995]  They're building a nightmare.
[00:15:04.275 --> 00:15:08.315]  And the people continue to double down, double down, over and over and over again.
[00:15:08.735 --> 00:15:13.076]  And just hoping maybe this time they'll be delivered to heaven.
[00:15:13.716 --> 00:15:14.296]  And to not hell.
[00:15:15.436 --> 00:15:17.237]  While they're building again hell here on earth.
[00:15:17.997 --> 00:15:19.617]  And then, oh, they take the shot.
[00:15:19.697 --> 00:15:20.477]  And then they get sick.
[00:15:20.577 --> 00:15:21.978]  And it's your fault for not taking it.
[00:15:22.798 --> 00:15:24.058]  They go buy the lottery ticket.
[00:15:24.078 --> 00:15:27.539]  And well, it's their fault they didn't buy more tickets.
[00:15:28.339 --> 00:15:29.879]  It's the creed of losers.
[00:15:31.257 --> 00:15:35.942]  How they get caught in a scam, and they won't admit they've been caught in a scam, and it only gets worse and worse.
[00:15:36.803 --> 00:15:43.649]  So when we come back, I'm going to talk about Dave Chappelle and his special, that's all the big roar, and how it ties into this paradigm management control system.
[00:15:43.669 --> 00:15:45.832]  And what we've got to do, we really want to break free of this tyranny.
[00:15:47.453 --> 00:15:48.334]  TERF is an acronym.
[00:15:49.275 --> 00:15:51.817]  Stands for Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminists.
[00:15:51.837 --> 00:15:52.738]  This is a real thing.
[00:15:52.778 --> 00:15:53.759]  This is a group of women.
[00:15:55.489 --> 00:16:01.291]  That hate transgender, they don't hate transgender women, but they look at trans women the way we blacks might look at blackface.
[00:16:01.371 --> 00:16:02.311]  It offends them.
[00:16:02.331 --> 00:16:10.413]  Like, eww, this bitch is doing an impression of me.
[00:16:10.693 --> 00:16:11.794]  Now, I shouldn't speak on this.
[00:16:13.254 --> 00:16:14.174]  Because I am not a woman.
[00:16:15.214 --> 00:16:16.075]  Nor am I a trans.
[00:16:17.395 --> 00:16:21.196]  But as we've established, I am a feminist.
[00:16:23.556 --> 00:16:25.556]  That's right.
[00:16:25.556 --> 00:16:29.556]  [applause]
[00:16:29.556 --> 00:16:31.556]  I'm Team Turf!
[00:16:31.556 --> 00:16:33.556]  I agree.
[00:16:33.561 --> 00:16:35.943]  I agree, man.
[00:16:36.903 --> 00:16:39.084]  Gender is a fact.
[00:16:39.125 --> 00:16:41.266]  You have to look at it from a woman's perspective.
[00:16:42.146 --> 00:16:42.847]  Look at it like this.
[00:16:43.327 --> 00:16:51.692]   Caitlyn Jenner, whom I've met, wonderful person, Caitlyn Jenner, Was voted Woman of the Year.
[00:16:52.532 --> 00:16:55.152]  Her first year as a woman.
[00:16:55.393 --> 00:16:56.093]  Ain't that something?
[00:16:56.513 --> 00:17:00.134]  Beat every bitch in Detroit, she's better than all of you.
[00:17:00.154 --> 00:17:01.114]  Gender is a fact.
[00:17:01.134 --> 00:17:01.814]  This is a fact.
[00:17:01.954 --> 00:17:08.695]  Every human being in this room, every human being on Earth, had to pass through the legs of a woman to be on Earth.
[00:17:09.095 --> 00:17:11.776]  That is a fact.
[00:17:13.823 --> 00:17:15.763]  And welcome back to this Thursday edition.
[00:17:15.863 --> 00:17:19.804]  Owen Troyer coming up next segment with all the breaking news and information plus guest.
[00:17:20.964 --> 00:17:23.725]  But I wanted to come into this segment and talk about Dave Chappelle.
[00:17:23.765 --> 00:17:26.005]  You just heard a clip from his Netflix special.
[00:17:26.485 --> 00:17:31.686]  And I've gone and seen Dave Chappelle in concert and I've watched the shows and I think he is a very funny man.
[00:17:32.527 --> 00:17:39.908]  And I think comparatively, well, looking at most comics, he has more courage than the average comic out there.
[00:17:41.184 --> 00:17:52.372]  That said, I did go ahead last night and watch his comedy special, because so many people had told me I should watch his new Netflix special, and I really thought overall it was disappointing.
[00:17:52.792 --> 00:17:54.293]  And the reason it was disappointing is this.
[00:17:55.554 --> 00:18:11.674]   Pointing out that women have babies, that men are physically stronger than women, and that the sexes are different, is like saying humans need oxygen to breathe, And then you've got the establishment corporate media saying, no, you don't need oxygen to breathe.
[00:18:12.135 --> 00:18:13.435]  You don't need oxygen to survive.
[00:18:13.455 --> 00:18:14.556]  You don't need oxygen to live.
[00:18:15.637 --> 00:18:24.501]  And then I go out and have a Netflix special and say, ladies and gentlemen, you need to breathe oxygen for you to be able to live.
[00:18:24.942 --> 00:18:26.402]  Humans without oxygen die.
[00:18:27.843 --> 00:18:32.166]  Now, that seems like an over exaggeration, but it's not.
[00:18:33.586 --> 00:18:40.570]   If you compare Saying that a man can have a baby and that a woman can be a man biologically.
[00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:50.495]  And then you go around with a big tech AI system censoring biologists and other scientists that point out that's not true.
[00:18:51.055 --> 00:18:53.276]  You're living in a giant gas lit cult.
[00:18:54.416 --> 00:18:55.357]  And here's the key to this.
[00:18:57.438 --> 00:19:00.083]  The people running this know it's pure bull.
[00:19:00.223 --> 00:19:06.533]  It's not like they're well-meaning liberals or leftists that we're reaching out to trying to convince otherwise.
[00:19:07.235 --> 00:19:13.214]   They want us To ignore science and data so they can give us shots that aren't vaccines that make us sick and kill us.
[00:19:13.574 --> 00:19:20.797]  And even when the statistics come out that that's happening, people are already wedded to it and committed to it as a religion, as a way of showing how good they are.
[00:19:21.337 --> 00:19:28.639]  And so they're willing to hurt themselves and their children in that process, just like every other culture, when it began to collapse, would sacrifice their children.
[00:19:29.741 --> 00:19:34.184]  It's horrible, it's evil, it goes against your common sense, but it's that symbol of total submission.
[00:19:34.244 --> 00:19:35.845]  And people would get high off of it.
[00:19:36.185 --> 00:19:41.188]  And women loved throwing their babies into fiery pits and watching them bubble and pop and their eyeballs pop out.
[00:19:42.409 --> 00:19:44.911]  I mean, people enjoyed cutting their children's hearts out.
[00:19:45.791 --> 00:19:48.253]  Because they were such heroes doing it for the Earth.
[00:19:48.633 --> 00:19:49.674]  Such heroes doing it.
[00:19:51.069 --> 00:19:51.689]  For the system.
[00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:55.492]  So, these average leftist women go to one of these abortuaries.
[00:19:55.512 --> 00:19:58.334]  They tell you, we love Satan, we love the devil, we're killing babies, we love it.
[00:19:58.574 --> 00:19:59.675]  They say it in private.
[00:19:59.695 --> 00:20:00.755]  They've been recorded saying it.
[00:20:00.995 --> 00:20:02.456]  They're not just doing it to shock Christians.
[00:20:03.577 --> 00:20:05.899]  They're dialed in to an evil force.
[00:20:06.687 --> 00:20:10.348]  You have excuses all day for why the women do it or oh they got raped or this or that.
[00:20:10.368 --> 00:20:12.568]  And of course there's real cases and real arguments.
[00:20:12.608 --> 00:20:18.909]  But at the end of the day, it is an evil, satanic force that is making all of these arguments.
[00:20:19.169 --> 00:20:20.109]  And what is satanic?
[00:20:20.249 --> 00:20:29.651]  Anti-Christ, anti-God, anti-life, anti-common sense, anti the way that we're designed to be through our free will to make the right decisions and be empowered.
[00:20:31.492 --> 00:20:33.832]  And so, I'm sitting there with my family.
[00:20:34.943 --> 00:20:42.388]  Watching him praise Dave Chappelle all day long yesterday, and then watch them praise him while he speaks, and how much courage he's got, and how incredible it is.
[00:20:43.529 --> 00:20:47.172]  And it was just like hearing somebody say that birds fly in the sky.
[00:20:48.092 --> 00:20:50.814]  And if that's courage, well then we're in a lot of trouble.
[00:20:51.114 --> 00:20:55.798]  And look, he said F Netflix, and F all these guys, because you know, he's the rebel.
[00:20:56.098 --> 00:20:58.280]  He's the guy out there on the cutting edge.
[00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:00.401]  And I think he actually, quote, means well.
[00:21:00.481 --> 00:21:02.603]  But is he really the rebel out on the cutting edge?
[00:21:03.507 --> 00:21:21.731]  No, because in the Overton window now, he's accepting of all those things and he made the whole show about those people and made them steal the spotlight while claiming he has a right to then diss them and say that they're not in charge of everything.
[00:21:23.393 --> 00:21:33.820]  But still, even if his show was wholesome and fun and good, if people spend all their time online or all their time watching TV programs or playing video games, it's unhealthy, it's destructive.
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:36.862]  Even if it was a quote, a good message, we know it's not fulfilling.
[00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:54.780]  When we go watch a movie or watch a TV show that is not news-based or facts-based, all the studies show that when we go into suspended disbelief, it lowers our brainwaves, it lowers our IQ over time, it contributes to all sorts of neurological disorders, because your brain is simply watching, it's not doing.
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:59.763]  It's not reading and then formulating the ideas and imaging the things in your mind.
[00:22:00.283 --> 00:22:03.985]  It's not listening to a radio show and having to image those things in the mind.
[00:22:04.806 --> 00:22:07.588]  It is simply having it all done for it.
[00:22:08.388 --> 00:22:13.853]  And the average human in the Western world spends eight hours in front of a TV or devices.
[00:22:14.513 --> 00:22:31.067]  And so even if Dave Chappelle's whole message was incredibly clean and incredibly good and all of it true, it would be sick and weird to watch hours and hours and hours about men that think they're women and scientists trying to, you know, say that men are women and all the rest of this.
[00:22:32.406 --> 00:22:33.547]  It's about domination.
[00:22:33.607 --> 00:22:34.568]  It's about control.
[00:22:34.688 --> 00:22:35.569]  It's about power.
[00:22:35.649 --> 00:22:38.912]  That's why you see the case just this week on the East Coast.
[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:45.905]  Where the man dressed as a woman raped the girl in the bathroom at the public school.
[00:22:46.686 --> 00:22:50.629]  And then they covered it up and transferred him to another school where he could then rape there again.
[00:22:50.649 --> 00:22:52.591]  And when the father complained, he was arrested.
[00:22:53.111 --> 00:22:54.372]  And you say, that's upside down.
[00:22:54.412 --> 00:22:55.213]  That doesn't make sense.
[00:22:55.293 --> 00:22:56.454]  Of course it's upside down.
[00:22:56.934 --> 00:22:58.195]  Of course it doesn't make sense.
[00:22:58.596 --> 00:23:02.399]  Because it's about breaking your will where you will put up with anything.
[00:23:03.237 --> 00:23:07.639]  They opened the borders, bringing millions of people untested for tuberculosis and other diseases.
[00:23:07.919 --> 00:23:08.999]  Spreads all over the US.
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:15.042]  But then, if you're an airline pilot and have already had COVID, and don't want to take the so-called vaccine that doesn't protect you, you're bad, you're fired.
[00:23:15.842 --> 00:23:20.084]  And Kamala Harris is moral and upright and good, and so is Biden, and you deserve to be fired.
[00:23:20.564 --> 00:23:27.307]  But then the same left says, oh, but an illegal alien, they don't need to be tested for anything, just bring them in and put their kids in school next to our kids so they can get TB.
[00:23:29.212 --> 00:23:30.053]  That's how this works.
[00:23:30.313 --> 00:23:31.514]  That's how these people operate.
[00:23:31.934 --> 00:23:33.756]  And so I'm not bashing Dave Chappelle.
[00:23:34.516 --> 00:23:37.018]  In fact, you know, I appreciate him saying that 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[00:23:38.219 --> 00:23:41.902]  But in a world where that is courage, you know you're living in 1984.
[00:23:42.002 --> 00:23:46.366]  In fact, it was George Orwell that said, in a world of universal deceit, telling the truth is...
[00:23:47.694 --> 00:24:02.804]  Revolutionary act and so I ask everybody is that who we've become is that who we are that this is a celebration That that someone can come out and say this Again, this is an assault on humanity.
[00:24:03.504 --> 00:24:23.044]   It's an assault on reality And we have to come back to the fact that disconnecting from the system and getting out of the corporate structure as much as we can and not valuing Hollywood and not valuing the garbage and lies they spew is what is going to lead us out of this tyranny.
[00:24:23.959 --> 00:24:32.403]  Now, we've had two different big articles from Reuters and others come out and lie about InfoWars and COVID-19 news we broke in, which shows they're very, very scared of this information.
[00:24:32.423 --> 00:24:37.265]  So we're going to come back to the other side and break that down that Owen Schroeder has taken over with one hell of a broadcast today.
[00:24:37.305 --> 00:24:37.865]  Please stay with us.
[00:24:38.746 --> 00:24:48.430]  The currency devaluation, the phthalates and bisphenol A and the plastics destroying our endocrine systems and rendering us sterile.
[00:24:50.371 --> 00:24:54.928]   The open borders, The funding of radical Islam.
[00:24:56.389 --> 00:24:59.549]  The promotion of pedophilia and transgenderism.
[00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:08.431]  All of this is the same as poison being injected out of a cobra's fangs into our body politic.
[00:25:09.911 --> 00:25:11.092]  This is an assault.
[00:25:12.152 --> 00:25:19.033]  That's why Communist China funds the majority of these type programs and owns four of the six major Hollywood production houses.
[00:25:19.713 --> 00:25:36.577]   And the very propaganda they finance in America The very poison they push on us that's just as deadly, in fact, more deadly because it's spiritual poison than fentanyl, is shipped into our nation and financed just like their shipment of the fentanyl is as well.
[00:25:38.599 --> 00:25:39.640]  And so that's where we are.
[00:25:41.181 --> 00:25:48.508]  And the fact that it's avant-garde for Dave Chappelle to say, I don't care who you are, if you came into this world, you came out from between a woman's legs.
[00:25:50.060 --> 00:26:05.932]  And the fact that as we speak on children's forms for schools around the world, the word mother and father has been taken off of the certificates because this is a scientific assault on who we are.
[00:26:06.893 --> 00:26:11.616]  This is a scientific assault on reality.
[00:26:12.817 --> 00:26:30.212]   And as I said in the second segment, we are not resisting a bunch of unorganized, crazy leftist And run-of-the-mill transgender sex offenders, like you see in the news as their vanguard.
[00:26:31.433 --> 00:26:47.006]  Above them is a scientifically directed program that does seek to make the biological act of procreation impossible outside of a laboratory in vitro setting.
[00:26:48.919 --> 00:27:16.907]  So the end game is to take control of human development and to destroy the environmental systems that have allowed humans to be successful on this planet and to establish an economy not based on expansion, not based on beauty, not based on honor, not based on humans, and instead build a system that is designed for the globalists to transcend what they call the failed state of being human.
[00:27:17.981 --> 00:27:24.284]  To escape this system that they're building for us, we must first recognize that it's a trap and that it is a military assault.
[00:27:24.964 --> 00:27:26.865]  We must realize there are globalists that run it.
[00:27:27.726 --> 00:27:44.154]  There are the think tanks and the armies of behavioral psychologists that think so little of us that they openly, again, write reports and brag about how they lie to us, and how they dumb us down, and how they control us, and yes, how they kill us.
[00:27:45.953 --> 00:27:48.115]  So we must get out of the contained paradigm.
[00:27:49.076 --> 00:28:01.367]  We must transcend the mainline propaganda and realize that it's not wacky leftists that are doing this because they're just lost and misguided.
[00:28:01.627 --> 00:28:02.908]  Those are the slaves of the system.
[00:28:03.949 --> 00:28:05.331]  Those are the cannon fodder of the system.
[00:28:05.771 --> 00:28:23.031]   But that it is consciously selfish, completely twisted, Individuals who want to play God that are turning our planet into a giant mad scientist's laboratory.
[00:28:24.271 --> 00:28:28.892]  It is not heroic to state that men are men and women are women.
[00:28:29.613 --> 00:28:33.033]  It is simply like drawing air into your lungs.
[00:28:34.394 --> 00:28:45.291]   It's time to talk about the Fortune 100, the control of the Fortune 500, Who are owned by just a handful of families that control the issuance of currency and credit.
[00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:49.872]  And that a corporate world government is being established.
[00:28:50.392 --> 00:28:58.397]  And that these corporations on record carry out the most heinous crimes against the populations of the world that we've ever seen.
[00:28:59.077 --> 00:29:05.481]  And it's those same megacorporations wrapping themselves in the camouflage of political correctness.
[00:29:06.482 --> 00:29:12.505]  To the point of almost every major corporate ad or commercial or spokesperson is black.
[00:29:13.306 --> 00:29:19.879]   Not just in the United States, But in Australia, and in Europe, and in the UK, and in Latin America.
[00:29:21.159 --> 00:29:24.560]  What does that have to do with American Airlines?
[00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:27.680]  What does that have to do with any of these things?
[00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:30.201]  It's not to help black people.
[00:29:31.881 --> 00:29:41.803]  It is to convince the world that the big corporations care about Africa, while Africa is the main target of the globalist takeover.
[00:29:42.762 --> 00:29:52.727]  You've heard the statement, keep your friends close, your enemies closer, and that's exactly what Big Pharma and the big banks are doing with their targeting of Africa.
[00:29:53.327 --> 00:30:14.795]   Then they trained the Christian West to feel sorry for past crimes, generational crimes, and so that we must now submit to the global corporation's edict Because the global corporations have donned blackface in hopes that we will acquiesce to their demands in the name of some type of reparations.
[00:30:15.496 --> 00:30:34.589]   Whereas it should be black people particularly that should see this, understand what's happening, and point out that just because Apple gave $100 million to George Soros' organization, Black Lives Matter, They do not represent black people or any other humans, period, on this planet, but represent true exploitation of humanity in the most classical sense.
[00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:49.980]  Long story short, everything the corporate media does is to dumb you down, to poison you, to make you alone, so you can have all of your assets sucked out of you before you're killed all alone in a room strapped and tied to the wall.
[00:30:51.521 --> 00:30:52.241]  That's their endgame.
[00:30:53.282 --> 00:30:55.704]  That's what the system temporarily on this planet wants.
[00:30:56.834 --> 00:30:58.815]  The spiritual force behind it wants your soul.
[00:31:00.336 --> 00:31:43.497]   Now coming up, Owen Schroer's got a ton of news to hit next segment, but he's also going to get into two different so-called fact-check stories, one by Reuters and one by a group funded by the Communist Chinese that came out and said that InfoWars ran a false report last week Concerning a interview that Dr. Fauci and others gave in a panel discussion on C-SPAN in 2019, in which they talked about blowing up the system and how a great new virus, a new entity, could be brought in to get rid of the 10-year waiting process on old vaccines and bring in mRNA.
[00:31:44.417 --> 00:31:57.621]   And in that 40-minute emergency report we shot, it's now got over a million and a half views at Band.Video, We also played Peter Daszak admitting that they created a virus like COVID-19 and a vaccine for it in 2019.
[00:31:58.282 --> 00:32:03.687]  But we also played Fauci saying Trump will be challenged by a novel virus and a new pandemic.
[00:32:04.709 --> 00:32:11.916]  And then I showed the London Independent and I showed Zero Hedge and Infowars and the links to the 900 plus documents that have come out.
[00:32:12.657 --> 00:32:26.565]  Where Fauci ordered the creation of what is COVID-19 with the four major viruses with the added gain of function from HIV and then his lying to Congress and how they said that they would use this virus and Operation Lockstep to bring in all their control.
[00:32:27.186 --> 00:32:46.002]   And so what happened is we showed in that 40 minute piece The background, them saying it, them lying to Congress, their own documents admitting they created it, that they created these spike protein prion crystals that can be sprayed on people that will go to their skin, that they plan to open air release it in China, but the Pentagon said, are you crazy?
[00:32:46.042 --> 00:32:46.602]  Don't do that.
[00:32:46.622 --> 00:32:48.364]  I mean, all that happened.
[00:32:48.964 --> 00:32:53.909]  And so here's the guy that engineered it, made it, stands to gain from it, controls the worldwide response to it.
[00:32:54.229 --> 00:32:56.091]  Big tech censors you if you try to talk about it.
[00:32:57.244 --> 00:32:59.626]  They try to block treatments for COVID-19 so more die.
[00:32:59.946 --> 00:33:01.347]  I mean, these are the bad guys.
[00:33:02.688 --> 00:33:07.292]  And then they have their fact check by, oh, here's an analogy.
[00:33:08.713 --> 00:33:21.424]  Let's say I wrote a thousand page book and in a hundred pages of it at the end, I tell you how to build a blacksmithing shop and say it's a self-help book.
[00:33:22.577 --> 00:33:29.444]  And then Reuters writes a fact check, did Alex Jones sell a 1000 page book that teaches how to build a blacksmithing shop in it?
[00:33:30.265 --> 00:33:41.616]  And then they just simply didn't read the 100 pages or didn't write on the 100 pages and simply reported on the first 100 or 200 pages instead of the last 100 pages and said, no, there's nothing about blacksmithing in the book.
[00:33:42.257 --> 00:33:43.938]  That's the same thing here, lying by omission.
[00:33:44.719 --> 00:33:45.479]  Fauci said it.
[00:33:45.519 --> 00:33:46.200]  They all said it.
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:46.880]  They cooked it up.
[00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:47.760]  They ordered it to be made.
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:48.580]  It's mainstream news.
[00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:49.381]  The documents are out.
[00:33:49.401 --> 00:33:50.061]  He lied about it.
[00:33:50.401 --> 00:33:58.023]  And then here they are bragging about how they need a virus to be released so they can get rid of the regular approval process and do whatever they want and have this revolution to, quote, blow up the whole system.
[00:33:58.304 --> 00:33:58.764]  You heard it.
[00:33:58.824 --> 00:33:59.764]  You know what they're talking about.
[00:33:59.844 --> 00:34:00.804]  Criminals love to brag.
[00:34:01.105 --> 00:34:02.205]  They're doing it out in the open.
[00:34:02.545 --> 00:34:04.886]  And we have all these videos of them admitting they did it.
[00:34:05.785 --> 00:34:08.946]  I've got a real serious question to ask all the viewers and listeners out there.
[00:34:08.786 --> 00:34:13.905]   So that's the reality of what's being broke down here and it's very dangerous, it's very, very evil.
[00:34:13.905 --> 00:34:19.204]   We'll go to break and come back with Owen, Infowars.com tomorrow's news today.
[00:34:19.204 --> 00:34:24.666]   I've got a real serious question to ask all the viewers and listeners out there.
[00:34:24.666 --> 00:34:28.825]  Do you guys realize that you are literally humanity's hope?
[00:34:28.825 --> 00:34:36.846]   I mean, God is the reason we're gonna win this fight in the end, but you understand God works through you
[00:34:36.846 --> 00:34:38.985]  and you are humanity's hope.
[00:34:38.985 --> 00:34:43.985]   And so we have a responsibility now because this vaccine being a poison, being a bio-weapon,
[00:34:43.985 --> 00:34:46.025]  it's not just theoretical now.
[00:34:46.025 --> 00:34:51.626]   It's not just all those amazing experts who came out before the vaccine was even released.
[00:34:51.846 --> 00:35:05.757]  And looked at what was in it, and looked at past studies of similar systems and said, hey, this is gonna cause blood clots, this is gonna cause infertility, this is gonna cause ADE, Antibody Dependent Enhancement, and now it's here.
[00:35:06.538 --> 00:35:19.048]  And now we've got this super cold in the UK, and if you notice, it's the vaccinated that are getting it, but they're not testing positive for COVID, but it's very similar because it's a spike protein and they're dying.
[00:35:19.889 --> 00:35:25.008]   And the British government's calling it The worst cold in their history.
[00:35:25.248 --> 00:35:25.809]  Isn't that funny?
[00:35:26.369 --> 00:35:29.671]  Suddenly we got more blood clots and heart attacks than in the UK's history.
[00:35:29.691 --> 00:35:32.353]  That was put out by the Scottish government last week.
[00:35:33.314 --> 00:35:38.518]  And suddenly the worst cold in history is just like COVID where you can't breathe.
[00:35:40.339 --> 00:35:42.061]  And what did all the scientists say would happen?
[00:35:42.441 --> 00:35:42.901]  ADE.
[00:35:44.102 --> 00:35:44.502]  ADE.
[00:35:45.043 --> 00:35:46.384]  Antibody Dependency Enhancement.
[00:35:47.685 --> 00:35:48.906]  Antibody Dependent Enhancement.
[00:35:50.336 --> 00:35:51.016]  And so here we are.
[00:35:51.036 --> 00:35:54.498]  I'm going to be talking about this a lot in a later report I'm going to file.
[00:35:54.538 --> 00:35:57.520]  I know Owen's about to be covering it now, but this is an emergency situation.
[00:35:58.801 --> 00:36:04.484]  Things are just getting more and more intense, and I feel so sorry for people that have taken the shots that are now going to be getting sick and dying.
[00:36:04.524 --> 00:36:06.985]  It's already happening, as predicted by top experts.
[00:36:07.005 --> 00:36:11.228]  But understand, they're going to be whipped into a fury that it's our fault they're dying.
[00:36:12.128 --> 00:36:13.409]  That was baked in from the beginning.
[00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:19.413]  So as much as we love these people, we need to be Christ-like, we also need to be very stern with them.
[00:36:20.253 --> 00:36:23.253]   when they try to blame us for the fact that they're dead and dying.
[00:36:23.253 --> 00:36:26.253]  Or their children are dying, or their parents are dying.
[00:36:26.253 --> 00:36:29.253]   So it's going to be a hellish winter, and it's going to get even worse.
[00:36:29.253 --> 00:36:33.253]   We're going to try to make the injections totally mandatory once the mass death begins.
[00:36:33.253 --> 00:36:36.253]   And big text in a sense for anybody that tries to tell the truth.
[00:36:36.253 --> 00:36:41.253]   So our worst analysis has been proven accurate, and the super cold is here,
[00:36:41.253 --> 00:36:42.253]  and that's what they're going to call it.
[00:36:42.481 --> 00:36:45.085]  The UK is the headquarters of this, along with Australia.
[00:36:45.105 --> 00:36:45.986]  It's from the same people.
[00:36:46.867 --> 00:36:48.610]  And notice everything that happens there comes here.
[00:36:48.690 --> 00:36:50.833]  So the beta test is it's going to be called the super cold.
[00:36:52.183 --> 00:36:56.744]  And they're not gonna tell you that it's COVID because, oh, you've had the vaccine, so you can't get sick from COVID.
[00:36:56.804 --> 00:36:57.864]  Oh, you're sick from something else.
[00:36:58.524 --> 00:37:03.666]  Whereas it's the vaccine and it's the antibody crisis that's happening.
[00:37:04.126 --> 00:37:06.826]  Antibody Dependent Enhancement, ADE.
[00:37:06.866 --> 00:37:09.127]  So we told you thousands of times it was coming.
[00:37:09.187 --> 00:37:10.687]  All the literature, in fact, showed that.
[00:37:11.467 --> 00:37:12.247]  And now here we are.
[00:37:12.407 --> 00:37:13.988]  It's called the super cold.
[00:37:14.848 --> 00:37:16.688]  The super cold is here right on time.
[00:37:17.608 --> 00:37:22.241]   And it's time we get Dr. Sherry Tenpenny and others Back on the show who predicted all this.
[00:37:22.881 --> 00:37:24.623]  It's time we get all those clips of them predicting it.
[00:37:24.643 --> 00:37:26.225]  A year and a half ago.
[00:37:26.245 --> 00:37:26.966]  A year ago.
[00:37:27.066 --> 00:37:30.790]  And then we show it to people because that's one of the few things that can wake these sheep up.
[00:37:31.931 --> 00:37:34.714]  You know, all the sensor systems are almost completely in place now.
[00:37:35.775 --> 00:37:38.398]  So humans aren't really even needed on Twitter and Facebook and Instagram now.
[00:37:39.997 --> 00:37:51.720]  I bet a lot of those fact checkers and people that were censoring all of us feel stupid now as they themselves have taken the shot and now as they themselves are getting violently ill and even dying from the biochemical weapon they were injected with.
[00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:55.401]  So, all you that pretended you were part of the establishment went along with it.
[00:37:55.921 --> 00:38:03.243]  It's still time to get right with God and repent and then to turn around and try to blow the whistle and save lives before this trap gets even worse into its next phase.
[00:38:04.249 --> 00:38:05.430]  This whole thing's been war-gamed out.
[00:38:05.450 --> 00:38:07.772]  All right, Owen Schroeder takes over right now.
[00:38:08.292 --> 00:38:10.154]  Infowars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[00:38:10.174 --> 00:38:11.715]  It's a life-or-death situation.
[00:38:11.795 --> 00:38:14.097]  Take these articles, take these reports, and get them out to folks right now.
[00:38:15.958 --> 00:38:29.609]  So it's something that Infowars has been covering since the beginning of the notion with the mRNA vaccines being used to stop the spread of COVID.
[00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:42.797]  And we had dozens of doctors on, and those are the clips Alex is talking about, and they said you're going to have ADE, which is where the vaccine essentially shuts down your natural immune system.
[00:38:42.997 --> 00:38:51.262]  It goes in and it kills your natural immune system and replaces it temporarily with a synthetic immune system.
[00:38:51.422 --> 00:38:52.763]  Your immune system basically just gives up.
[00:38:54.133 --> 00:39:04.015]  And then any bug or virus or disease or whatever can get in there, and you have no immune system to fight it, so you get more sick than you ever have.
[00:39:06.415 --> 00:39:09.536]  So we just had the dozens of doctors on explaining this, breaking this down.
[00:39:09.856 --> 00:39:10.556]  I'm not a doctor.
[00:39:10.856 --> 00:39:12.956]  I didn't understand that until it was broken down to me.
[00:39:14.277 --> 00:39:15.557]  But now we're actually seeing it.
[00:39:15.637 --> 00:39:16.337]  And it makes sense.
[00:39:16.397 --> 00:39:22.178]  I mean, if you understand the immune system and just general biology and health, then yeah, of course that's what's going to happen.
[00:39:25.478 --> 00:39:32.986]  So that's why they're coming out now and saying, well, you need to get COVID even if you've been vaccinated or double vaccinated.
[00:39:33.087 --> 00:39:34.748]  Well, then why even get the vaccine?
[00:39:35.329 --> 00:39:37.632]  Well, because they got to make money.
[00:39:39.321 --> 00:39:52.989]  And they have to train you into the acceptance that, oh, well, if the government mandates that I need a medical procedure, well, then that's just the case.
[00:39:53.329 --> 00:39:54.210]  I just have to have it.
[00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:55.630]  It doesn't matter if I don't need it.
[00:39:55.951 --> 00:39:57.892]  It doesn't matter if it's going to be detrimental to me.
[00:39:58.312 --> 00:39:59.833]  It doesn't matter if it could kill me.
[00:39:59.893 --> 00:40:08.429]   The government mandates it, and the government loves me, and they have a much better Interest than I would have in my own life and in my own body.
[00:40:08.509 --> 00:40:10.209]  So I love big government.
[00:40:10.269 --> 00:40:11.390]  I love big daddy government.
[00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:12.450]  I love big brother government.
[00:40:13.251 --> 00:40:16.952]  If they tell me to chop my leg off and even then for no reason, I'll do it.
[00:40:17.012 --> 00:40:19.253]  If they tell me to chop my hand off for no reason, I'll do it.
[00:40:19.573 --> 00:40:22.815]  They tell me to inject, I need to inject myself with a poison, I'll do it.
[00:40:22.875 --> 00:40:24.895]  Whatever the government says, I love them so much.
[00:40:25.896 --> 00:40:27.136]  And they love me so much.
[00:40:30.178 --> 00:40:39.512]   So you become a profit center, like a slave, It's like, oh wow, you work, and you make money, and you get a paycheck, and then you're forced to give it right over to Big Pharma.
[00:40:39.532 --> 00:40:46.598]  You're forced to give it right over to whoever the government tells you to, whether it's via taxes or mandates.
[00:40:46.878 --> 00:40:47.879]  Oh, mandate tests.
[00:40:48.079 --> 00:40:49.240]  Oh, mandate vaccines.
[00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:50.762]  Oh, mandate this medical procedure.
[00:40:50.782 --> 00:40:52.143]  By the way, we're raising your taxes.
[00:40:52.783 --> 00:40:54.064]  So who are you really working for?
[00:40:54.125 --> 00:40:55.306]  Well, you're working for Big Pharma.
[00:40:55.346 --> 00:40:56.407]  You're working for big banks.
[00:40:57.508 --> 00:41:00.130]  You're working for whoever controls the government at that time.
[00:41:04.229 --> 00:41:11.313]  So I've got all the latest news that I'm going to get into when it comes to COVID and the vaccines here on my desk, as well as a bunch of other news.
[00:41:13.714 --> 00:41:40.087]   But it's frustrating for now almost two years to be dealing with all the lies that have come out with COVID, but then to see that everything we've been talking about has been accurate and spot on and true, only to know that the mainstream media is not going to stop lying, only to know that those that Speak the truth or have open minds are just going to continue to be censored and ridiculed and attacked like Joe Rogan.
[00:41:41.968 --> 00:41:48.013]  And while you could give Dr. Goop to credit for going on Joe Rogan and that's fine.
[00:41:49.386 --> 00:41:55.371]  And Rogan, I mean, it appears introduced things to the, one of the medical experts on CNN.
[00:41:55.411 --> 00:41:56.832]  He said he'd never seen them before.
[00:41:56.852 --> 00:41:59.013]  And it's just like, how is that possible?
[00:41:59.154 --> 00:42:00.775]  How have you never seen this stuff before?
[00:42:01.115 --> 00:42:02.356]  Is it because it's censored everywhere?
[00:42:02.396 --> 00:42:03.577]  Is it because you don't want to see it?
[00:42:03.637 --> 00:42:04.658]  Is it because you're lazy?
[00:42:05.438 --> 00:42:05.799]  What is it?
[00:42:05.859 --> 00:42:09.321]  How did you, how have you never seen that Ivermectin is Nobel Peace Prize winning for humans?
[00:42:09.602 --> 00:42:12.203]  How have you not been seeing all the massive vaccine side effects?
[00:42:12.484 --> 00:42:18.028]  How did you not see the released memos before the vaccine came out saying it was going to cause all these side effects?
[00:42:18.228 --> 00:42:21.410]  How did you not see that Fauci made the virus in a lab with the Chinese Communist?
[00:42:21.651 --> 00:42:23.552]  How did you not see that Peter Daszak was involved?
[00:42:23.772 --> 00:42:24.993]  How did you not see all of it?
[00:42:25.033 --> 00:42:25.814]  He didn't see any of it.
[00:42:25.854 --> 00:42:26.774]  He'd never heard of any of it.
[00:42:26.794 --> 00:42:27.555]  He had no idea.
[00:42:27.895 --> 00:42:30.817]  Now, Joe Rogan doesn't do debates.
[00:42:32.719 --> 00:42:37.102]  But that was the closest thing to a COVID vaccine debate that we've had yet.
[00:42:37.362 --> 00:42:38.963]  And you notice what was the result.
[00:42:39.343 --> 00:42:40.864]  Gupta was schooled.
[00:42:40.884 --> 00:42:44.867]  A medical doctor, expert for CNN, was schooled.
[00:42:46.107 --> 00:42:50.931]  By Joe Rogan, a podcast host and a TV show host and producer.
[00:42:51.812 --> 00:42:52.592]  Not a medical doctor.
[00:42:54.454 --> 00:43:04.542]  That's not to slight Joe Rogan, he obviously is very well educated and well versed on these issues, but the point is, that's a top medical expert for CNN and a doctor getting schooled by a podcast host.
[00:43:05.803 --> 00:43:06.784]  And that wasn't even a debate.
[00:43:07.104 --> 00:43:10.127]  Can you imagine if we actually had a real debate?
[00:43:12.162 --> 00:43:13.222]  That was just a discussion.
[00:43:13.723 --> 00:43:19.565]  Can you imagine if we actually had a real debate about COVID or about the vaccines?
[00:43:19.925 --> 00:43:21.245]  I think we all know how it would go.
[00:43:22.566 --> 00:43:24.106]  I think we all know how that would go.
[00:43:24.786 --> 00:43:25.827]  That was just a discussion.
[00:43:25.887 --> 00:43:31.029]  Joe Rogan was being friendly to Gupta, and Gupta just showed how he's clueless, sadly.
[00:43:31.589 --> 00:43:32.969]  But I guess we shouldn't be surprised.
[00:43:33.089 --> 00:43:35.310]  The CNN doctor doesn't do research.
[00:43:35.730 --> 00:43:40.732]  He just puts on makeup and goes on TV and has doctor in front of his name, so CNN calls him a medical expert.
[00:43:43.151 --> 00:43:45.662]  But that's why InfoWars has to be on air, folks.
[00:43:46.124 --> 00:43:47.993]  Because... And you know...
[00:43:49.665 --> 00:43:54.588]  If one person gets this information and shares it with one person today, then that's a victory.
[00:43:55.029 --> 00:43:57.110]  If it's thousands, that's a massive victory.
[00:43:57.610 --> 00:43:59.271]  But it only goes as far as you share it.
[00:43:59.651 --> 00:44:03.774]  And we're only here thanks to your support at Infowarsstore.com, where we have the best supplements.

[00:44:30.766 --> 00:44:32.387]  And then you're seeing all the shortages, folks.
[00:44:32.507 --> 00:44:32.907]  Are you not?
[00:44:33.507 --> 00:44:36.888]  Are you not seeing the supply chain shortages that we warned you about a year and a half ago?
[00:44:37.328 --> 00:44:37.808]  You are.
[00:44:38.569 --> 00:44:42.510]  Maybe the time to get emergency food supplies at InfoWarsStore.com as well.
[00:44:43.146 --> 00:44:44.928]  Okay, we are here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:44:44.988 --> 00:44:46.089]  Owen Schroer sitting in.
[00:44:47.070 --> 00:44:51.836]  I'm about to get into all the latest breaking news and headlines on all kinds of different fronts.
[00:44:51.936 --> 00:44:56.541]  But first, the latest report from John Bowne highlighting exactly what Alex was just talking about.
[00:44:56.981 --> 00:44:57.582]  It's inevitable.
[00:44:58.162 --> 00:45:02.988]  The collapse of America and the sick and the death and everything is going to be blamed on the unvaccinated.
[00:45:03.028 --> 00:45:03.869]  Here's John Bowne's report.
[00:45:05.632 --> 00:45:06.812]  This is economic warfare.
[00:45:06.872 --> 00:45:07.873]  This is World War III.
[00:45:07.953 --> 00:45:15.795]  Let me say that again for Rand Paul and all the other senators that are halfway awake, who do a great job on the topics they cover, but they never address this.
[00:45:16.275 --> 00:45:20.497]  The corporate-controlled, UN-directed Great Reset is here.
[00:45:21.077 --> 00:45:22.677]  This is economic warfare.
[00:45:22.737 --> 00:45:24.638]  This is World War III.
[00:45:25.398 --> 00:45:28.399]  And InfoWars has always been the canary in the coal mine.
[00:45:29.159 --> 00:45:40.143]   For when you know InfoWars is in trouble, you know the country is on its knees and Willfully sticking its head into the chopping block of the GIA team.
[00:45:40.603 --> 00:45:43.584]  People ask, how is InfoWars handling all the attacks and all the lies?
[00:45:43.884 --> 00:45:44.984]  I mean, I'm in this with you.
[00:45:45.504 --> 00:45:46.324]  You're under attack.
[00:45:46.425 --> 00:45:47.545]  I just focus on this.
[00:45:48.085 --> 00:46:00.129]  I report on this and I try to expose those behind it, hoping governors and legislatures and good people in Congress are still there, wake up to the full magnitude of what this is, a foreign multinational economic warfare takeover.
[00:46:01.055 --> 00:46:06.922]  We have an important announcement that will get things you buy to you to the shelves faster.
[00:46:07.763 --> 00:46:18.295]  I'm joined by the Executive Director of the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, Gene Sirocca and Mario Cordono.
[00:46:20.397 --> 00:46:21.718]  I apologize.
[00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:45.784]  So CNN has a big article out, there's a bunch of these, saying that America deserved to collapse, and that America didn't take all its shots, and that's why you're not gonna have any products for Christmas, or the food prices are gonna be more, and the factories are breaking down, and there's not gonna be enough fuel like Europe, and the electricity's gonna be going off, all because you didn't take your shots.
[00:46:45.824 --> 00:46:59.227]   They say, we tried to save you from COVID, but you didn't do a good job, read the article, And so now, no, it's not the COVID lockdowns that did this, destroying the worldwide supply chains that are still in place in Africa and Latin America.
[00:46:59.287 --> 00:47:00.028]  No, no, no, no.
[00:47:00.408 --> 00:47:02.668]  It's not the 20 plus million they starve to death.
[00:47:02.688 --> 00:47:06.470]  Another tens of millions have already starved to death, but the numbers aren't out this year yet.
[00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:07.350]  That's last year's numbers.
[00:47:08.070 --> 00:47:10.792]  No, ladies and gentlemen, it's the American people's fault.
[00:47:10.892 --> 00:47:15.235]  If only reliable, trustworthy information about this pandemic could reach everybody.
[00:47:15.315 --> 00:47:20.239]  Instead, some big-name voices on the far right are peddling lies for profit.
[00:47:20.359 --> 00:47:22.481]  The same thing is happening to our democracy.
[00:47:22.581 --> 00:47:24.062]  The big lie is still with us.
[00:47:24.622 --> 00:47:31.787]  Here in D.C., Trump supporters held a rally, pathetic as it was, in support of what they call the political prisoners of January 6th.
[00:47:32.328 --> 00:47:36.691]  So much for the conspiracy theory that Antifa, or the FBI, was behind the insurrection.
[00:47:37.051 --> 00:47:37.971]  This is the Great Reset.
[00:47:38.051 --> 00:47:39.092]  This is economic war.
[00:47:39.192 --> 00:47:40.252]  It's how they take you over.
[00:47:40.352 --> 00:47:41.273]  It's clout and pivot.
[00:47:41.353 --> 00:47:42.473]  They can't beat capitalism.
[00:47:42.493 --> 00:47:44.854]  They can't beat even corrupt versions of capitalism.
[00:47:45.374 --> 00:47:47.435]  Or even with a system where 20% is capitalism.
[00:47:47.755 --> 00:47:55.819]  Because it produces so much wealth and so much prosperity that socialism and communism and fascism cannot compete.
[00:47:56.339 --> 00:47:57.860]  So the Great Reset is here.
[00:47:58.660 --> 00:48:05.816]   It is a United Nations-directed, megacorporation-controlled, Takeover of society.
[00:48:06.757 --> 00:48:23.783]  And they are issuing, through the central banks they control, unlimited currency out of all the countries of the world, giving it to themselves, while they shut down economies and shut down Main Street economies and farms and ranches and industries, they're also consolidating and buying up everything right now.
[00:48:24.753 --> 00:48:33.279]  Bill Gates has been snatching up 242,000 acres of farmland across the U.S., enough to make him the top private farmland owner in America.
[00:48:33.299 --> 00:48:42.545]  So the whole future is going to be underground economies, us coming together, us realizing we're under global corporate siege, and that hiding from it is what got us here.
[00:48:43.125 --> 00:48:44.847]  Keeping our head down is what got us here.
[00:48:45.567 --> 00:48:53.293]   And so many people that have gone along with the corruption, they think that they're going to be protected just because They were useful idiots and went along with it as well.
[00:48:53.653 --> 00:48:55.735]  They're gonna be the first to lose everything they've got.
[00:48:55.755 --> 00:49:00.659]  This follows an exact paradigm, this follows an exact system.
[00:49:04.863 --> 00:49:09.507]  And so, it has all begun, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:49:11.028 --> 00:49:17.234]  And we're dealing with such stubborn narcissists that have fallen for the big lie, fallen for the big crimes.
[00:49:18.755 --> 00:49:19.876]  And they're just never gonna let it go.
[00:49:19.896 --> 00:49:21.176]  They're gonna go down with that ship.
[00:49:22.557 --> 00:49:31.881]  It's like being on a ship at sea and cannons just blasting holes into the hub and into the hull and you're just taking on water and you say, we gotta abandon ship, it's taking water.
[00:49:31.901 --> 00:49:32.702]  They say, no it's not!
[00:49:33.042 --> 00:49:34.142]  This ship is fine!
[00:49:37.244 --> 00:49:44.967]  Okay, let me just do a show reset here as I am taking over host duties for the remainder of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:49:45.007 --> 00:49:46.048]  I have a guest coming up.
[00:49:47.293 --> 00:49:51.935]  Alex Stein who, uh, maybe it's Alex Stein, maybe it's Alexander Stein.
[00:49:52.435 --> 00:49:52.935]  I don't know.
[00:49:54.055 --> 00:49:55.596]  Neither does the Dallas City Council.
[00:49:56.476 --> 00:49:57.976]  So, uh, you're not going to want to miss that.
[00:49:58.017 --> 00:49:58.857]  Looking forward to that.
[00:49:59.257 --> 00:50:04.759]  Kate Daly hosts the fourth hour, then I'll be back hosting the War Room from three to six.
[00:50:05.059 --> 00:50:08.280]  And I have enough news on my desk.
[00:50:09.594 --> 00:50:14.217]  For five hours of news coverage that I'm set to embark on right now.
[00:50:14.777 --> 00:50:16.558]  Not to mention all of the video clips.
[00:50:16.578 --> 00:50:21.942]  But let me just do a reset here on the Alex Jones Show and kind of give you the waterfront.
[00:50:24.823 --> 00:50:31.267]  The censorship is only ramping up and it's reaching new levels of censorship.
[00:50:31.808 --> 00:50:33.268]  So it's not just the political censorship.
[00:50:33.328 --> 00:50:42.982]   It's anybody who shows any semblance of being a patriot or a free thinker or a truth teller That has a large platform, they're being eliminated.
[00:50:45.124 --> 00:50:46.726]  It's cancelling songs.
[00:50:47.246 --> 00:50:58.497]  Do you remember they cancelled that one Christmas song because it talks about a man and a woman getting together and cuddling together in the cold and snuggling and oh my gosh.
[00:50:59.318 --> 00:51:00.098]  Oh jeez.
[00:51:00.739 --> 00:51:01.560]  We can't have that.
[00:51:02.756 --> 00:51:11.141]  We can't have men and women coming together and being romantic and snuggling and cuddling and oh my goodness gracious it's just the horror of it all.
[00:51:11.461 --> 00:51:11.961]  So bad.
[00:51:15.784 --> 00:51:24.809]  And now anything you talk about that doesn't go along with the global death cult is getting removed from the internet.
[00:51:26.707 --> 00:51:33.273]  So it's like, oh my gosh, that man just touched that woman's arm and just, oh, oh, oh no, it's so inappropriate, oh my God.
[00:51:33.513 --> 00:51:38.397]  But then they'll send pedophiles to your school to do lap dances for them, so that's good.
[00:51:38.917 --> 00:51:46.764]  See, men and women, men and women, man and woman combined, love, sex, children, marriage, that's bad.
[00:51:48.185 --> 00:51:50.848]  Pedophile man with a beard that dresses up like a woman?
[00:51:52.755 --> 00:51:58.738]  And has sexual assault charges in the past, goes to your school, bounces your kid on the lap, reads them about gay sex?
[00:51:58.958 --> 00:51:59.399]  Good.
[00:51:59.759 --> 00:52:00.700]  We need more of that.
[00:52:01.620 --> 00:52:03.802]  Men and women loving each other, having kids?
[00:52:04.062 --> 00:52:05.162]  No, no, no, no.
[00:52:05.463 --> 00:52:21.313]  And then I also have stories, it's just a side note over here, how I've never seen the attacks on children, or the having of children, I should say, the birthing of children, men and women having kids, I've never seen the attacks on it so much.
[00:52:22.964 --> 00:52:32.746]  And it's a weird instinctual thing, it's like I'm so anti-establishment, I'm so anti-New World Order, it like pushes my psyche and consciousness in ways that I have no control of.
[00:52:33.907 --> 00:52:35.287]  I'm 32, I don't have any kids.
[00:52:35.707 --> 00:52:38.628]  I want to have kids, but I felt like, you know, God will give it the time.
[00:52:38.948 --> 00:52:43.609]  And I just see all this stuff saying, never have kids, kids are bad, kids are the worst thing ever.
[00:52:43.849 --> 00:52:45.030]  Don't have kids, you demon!
[00:52:45.070 --> 00:52:47.330]  Now it's like, wow, I really need to start making kids, huh?
[00:52:47.590 --> 00:52:50.511]  If that's what pisses the New World Order off, I ought to start cranking them out.
[00:52:52.366 --> 00:52:57.789]  Yeah, see, that's okay, but oh, the song Brown Sugar by the Rolling Stones is now banned.
[00:52:58.129 --> 00:52:59.790]  Oh my gosh, Brown Sugar?
[00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:05.313]  Is he talking about a beautiful woman with dark skin complexion?
[00:53:05.393 --> 00:53:06.494]  I just, oh my God!
[00:53:07.954 --> 00:53:08.975]  Oh, it's a person of color!
[00:53:09.175 --> 00:53:10.476]  Oh, I'm so sorry, guys!
[00:53:10.756 --> 00:53:11.977]  Ban me, cancel me!
[00:53:14.318 --> 00:53:21.702]  Okay, and then you have... How is Biden, how is the Biden administration gonna cover this up?
[00:53:22.944 --> 00:53:24.786]  It's kind of like what the mayor of Austin just did.
[00:53:25.447 --> 00:53:27.710]  Violent crime is skyrocketing in Austin.
[00:53:28.110 --> 00:53:30.013]  Poverty is skyrocketing in Austin.
[00:53:30.293 --> 00:53:39.044]  And he comes out and makes a statement today saying, yeah, we're having mass crime waves, and we're seeing mass homelessness, and it's not a good situation.
[00:53:39.064 --> 00:53:41.507]  But that's just what happens in big cities.
[00:53:41.567 --> 00:53:42.348]  It's not my fault.
[00:53:43.502 --> 00:53:43.942]  Wrong!
[00:53:44.343 --> 00:53:46.885]  That's what happens in Democrat-run cities.
[00:53:47.485 --> 00:53:47.605]  Ah!
[00:53:48.346 --> 00:53:51.709]  That's what's happened in Austin now because of our Democrat mayor.
[00:53:51.729 --> 00:54:04.899]  So how is the Biden administration going to cover up the massive inflation, the massive increase in the consumer price index, the stalling of the shipments and the ports and the cargo and the oil and everything?
[00:54:04.919 --> 00:54:10.364]  I mean, just the total beginning of the collapse of our economy, the economic warfare that's happening right now.
[00:54:10.824 --> 00:54:12.766]  How are they going to cover that up?
[00:54:14.295 --> 00:54:16.816]  Well, maybe they're going to blame you, the unvaccinated person.
[00:54:17.176 --> 00:54:19.056]  You say, well, that doesn't make any logical sense.
[00:54:19.536 --> 00:54:21.097]  Nothing they do makes logical sense.
[00:54:21.377 --> 00:54:23.037]  Why would we ever hold them to that standard?
[00:54:25.038 --> 00:54:27.659]  And so we've got more on that, and they're admitting it now, folks.
[00:54:28.159 --> 00:54:29.459]  They're admitting, get ready.
[00:54:29.839 --> 00:54:31.800]  There's going to be total shortages by Christmas.
[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:34.420]  Your heating bills are going to skyrocket.
[00:54:35.281 --> 00:54:36.901]  Food and water is going to be scarce.
[00:54:37.941 --> 00:54:50.829]   And look, we live in a capitalist country, and we're lucky that we have so much excess that Most likely you in the audience are not going to starve from the massive supply chain shortages that are coming.
[00:54:50.869 --> 00:54:52.510]  It's not going to be like Venezuela overnight.
[00:54:52.550 --> 00:54:53.611]  But you're going to see it.
[00:54:53.671 --> 00:54:55.112]  You're going to see empty shelves.
[00:54:55.753 --> 00:55:01.677]  There's going to be goods and services that you're used to having and having easy access to that you're not going to have anymore.
[00:55:02.338 --> 00:55:04.259]  And it's not going to totally ruin our country yet.
[00:55:04.319 --> 00:55:05.820]  It's not going to totally devastate us yet.
[00:55:06.161 --> 00:55:08.362]  But you're going to see it and it's going to frustrate you.
[00:55:09.543 --> 00:55:26.968]   For example, And this is more of the Democrat crime waves that are happening, where there's dozens of Walgreens closing in California, and now people are really mad because they fill up their prescription to Walgreens, or Walgreens is where they go for just, you know, daily needs and necessities, and they're all gone!
[00:55:27.089 --> 00:55:27.989]  They have nowhere to go now!
[00:55:28.029 --> 00:55:28.829]  There's no Walgreens!
[00:55:29.250 --> 00:55:51.181]   Because the Walgreens are all closed, because there was so much what they call organized retail crime now, this is a new phenomenon, only happens in Democrat-run cities, organized retail crime, Where large groups of people run into retail shops like Walgreens and just steal mass amounts of things, just filling multiple trash bags and backpacks and then they just run out of the store.
[00:55:51.461 --> 00:55:58.966]  So you'll have, so instead of losing all the money because of the theft and having empty shelves because of the massive theft, they just close the store.
[00:55:58.986 --> 00:56:00.887]  And so Walgreens doesn't care.
[00:56:02.108 --> 00:56:02.829]  Part of Walmart.
[00:56:02.849 --> 00:56:03.329]  They don't care.
[00:56:03.349 --> 00:56:06.432]  They've got billions of dollars so they can close their doors and all right, fine.
[00:56:06.452 --> 00:56:07.773]  Their bottom line's barely affected.
[00:56:07.793 --> 00:56:13.458]  In fact, it works out better for them because now they're not taking massive losses due to the organized retail crime.
[00:56:13.498 --> 00:56:14.019]  Oh, that's nice.
[00:56:14.059 --> 00:56:14.859]  Open the door for them, too.
[00:56:16.221 --> 00:56:17.922]  It's white supremacists doing it, by the way.
[00:56:18.242 --> 00:56:24.628]  And don't tell me just because their skin isn't white that it's not white supremacists.
[00:56:25.128 --> 00:56:26.169]  That standard is gone.
[00:56:26.229 --> 00:56:26.730]  Don't you know?
[00:56:26.830 --> 00:56:28.151]  Larry Elder, white supremacist.
[00:56:28.171 --> 00:56:28.992]  The Democrats told me.
[00:56:30.017 --> 00:56:32.059]  Dave Chappelle's now a white supremacist too.
[00:56:32.599 --> 00:56:33.861]  So it's not a skin thing.
[00:56:33.901 --> 00:56:42.589]  A white supremacist thing is now a, if you're a political opposition to the New World Order or the Democrat Party, it doesn't matter what your skin color is, you're a white supremacist.
[00:56:43.890 --> 00:56:44.690]  That's their logic.
[00:56:45.711 --> 00:56:47.053]  And these people want to lead the planet.
[00:56:47.994 --> 00:56:52.898]  Then my biggest stack of news over here is just more COVID, more vaccine stuff.
[00:56:53.358 --> 00:56:54.700]  I can do this every day and I do.
[00:56:57.094 --> 00:56:59.355]  And I don't like being redundant.
[00:56:59.776 --> 00:57:02.917]  In fact, it drives me insane being redundant.
[00:57:03.838 --> 00:57:06.679]  But I'm going to cover the news every day.
[00:57:06.699 --> 00:57:10.061]  And every day, there's more people that have died from the vaccine.
[00:57:11.639 --> 00:57:15.021]  And every day there's more people having massive side effects from the vaccine.
[00:57:15.221 --> 00:57:17.902]  And so we just cover it every day.
[00:57:18.022 --> 00:57:21.103]  Now it's basketball players that can't play basketball anymore.
[00:57:21.503 --> 00:57:23.664]  Hockey players that can't play hockey anymore.
[00:57:24.085 --> 00:57:25.545]  Runners that can't run anymore.
[00:57:25.945 --> 00:57:27.366]  Fighters that can't fight anymore.
[00:57:27.806 --> 00:57:30.347]  Every single one forced to get the vaccine.
[00:57:30.807 --> 00:57:34.069]  Now they can't engage in their athletic activity.
[00:57:36.411 --> 00:57:45.658]  That gruesome story that came out of Loudoun County about the boy that dresses as a girl and goes into the bathroom and sexually assaults girls, that's now been confirmed.
[00:57:45.678 --> 00:57:48.600]  So first they tried to act like, well, this parent is just out of control.
[00:57:48.620 --> 00:57:49.921]  We weren't covering up that crime.
[00:57:50.041 --> 00:57:51.883]  No, they did cover it up so they could pass a bill.
[00:57:52.623 --> 00:58:05.468]  And then the boy that dresses like a girl raped, they won't say rape, they keep saying sexual assault, but they claim there's penetration, so last I checked that was rape, but okay, we'll be politically correct, it was just sexual assault.
[00:58:06.149 --> 00:58:16.313]  And there's no Me Too movement to protect those young girls that got sexually assaulted into their bathrooms, because Democrats is why, because Democrats.
[00:58:18.075 --> 00:58:38.462]  And so I've got all that coming up and then all kinds of video clips as well where they're just admitting... Can you imagine though, I guess it was almost a year, I guess it was more than a year ago when we started seeing the Democrats adopting the UN World Government slogan of Build Back Better.
[00:58:39.824 --> 00:58:51.147]  The UN World Government was using that slogan years ago in their documents, in their published documents, and then it got adopted by the Democrat Party in 2019 when they were campaigning.
[00:58:51.587 --> 00:58:52.367]  Now it's here!
[00:58:53.168 --> 00:59:03.190]  So it's not Bill of Rights, it's not Freedom of Speech, it's not Second Amendment, it's not the Constitution, it's nothing that is America, freedom, free market.
[00:59:03.290 --> 00:59:08.952]  No, it's build back better, destroy the free market, build back in a communist world government.
[00:59:10.663 --> 00:59:16.448]  So we've discussed the COVID tyranny, the medical tyranny, a lot so far today.
[00:59:17.108 --> 00:59:25.335]  But that is just the entry, that is just the gateway into totalitarian, authoritarian, world government tyranny.
[00:59:27.457 --> 00:59:31.340]  And it is ushering us in rapidly, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:36.184]  And a lot of people can see it, a lot of people are frustrated by it, a lot of people are in denial of it.
[00:59:37.204 --> 00:59:39.887]  But yet here we are, and you're seeing the signs and symptoms.
[00:59:41.590 --> 00:59:45.813]  I have more people that reach out to me than ever because they're just freaked out by all of this.
[00:59:48.335 --> 00:59:53.698]  And I think that it's important to communicate it's not going away.
[00:59:55.520 --> 00:59:56.420]  It's not going away.
[00:59:56.440 --> 01:00:18.530]   Because even though Rand Paul has taken some good stands and he's gone against Fauci and he's declared a mass peaceful non-compliance and there's other great people in Congress, but it's a small force and Overall, it's not an obstacle to the medical tyranny that we are being subjected to right now.
[01:00:18.710 --> 01:00:28.559]  It'd be like putting a rock, you know, the size of your fingernail, in front of a car and saying, this rock is going to stop the car.
[01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:32.383]  No, the car is going to drive right over the rock or it won't even have an impact at all.
[01:00:32.743 --> 01:00:33.344]  It'll have no problem.
[01:00:35.131 --> 01:00:39.054]  Now, the biggest rock put in front of that car would be InfoWars.
[01:00:39.134 --> 01:00:40.735]  That's why they had to take us off the road.
[01:00:41.095 --> 01:00:43.156]  But even InfoWars would not be big enough to stop it.
[01:00:46.518 --> 01:00:59.721]   But it's the entire population, it's mass peaceful non-compliance of the population that can make an obstacle big enough But even then, it would be a battle.
[01:00:59.761 --> 01:01:08.471]  There needs to be a real opposition to this in government, in the corporate government, in the media, everywhere.
[01:01:08.531 --> 01:01:09.672]  That's the only hope we have.
[01:01:09.772 --> 01:01:13.417]  But, I explain to people.
[01:01:14.744 --> 01:01:18.789]  If you don't like the medical tyranny from COVID, this isn't going anywhere.
[01:01:18.809 --> 01:01:20.651]  This is just a precedent being set.
[01:01:21.052 --> 01:01:30.844]  The next level, which sadly I have to say, I think we're going to get to, I think we're going to see it probably within two or three years, it's going to be worse than the COVID tyranny and that's going to be the climate tyranny.
[01:01:33.254 --> 01:01:37.237]  So we'll get to that coming up, but what are the real world implications?
[01:01:37.317 --> 01:01:42.382]  What are the real world effects that people are going to see and have to deal with?
[01:01:43.002 --> 01:01:45.144]  Well, with COVID, it's the vaccine mandates.
[01:01:46.245 --> 01:01:52.390]  It's the government shutting down businesses or mandating this or mandating that.
[01:01:53.872 --> 01:01:56.374]  Almost everybody's had some level of dealing with that.
[01:01:56.774 --> 01:01:58.596]  It's been a lot worse for some than others.
[01:01:59.974 --> 01:02:01.554]  But what about when it comes to climate change?
[01:02:01.575 --> 01:02:03.435]  What's the overall impact of all of this?
[01:02:03.475 --> 01:02:15.399]  Well, you have to understand first, out of the gates, that the world leaders, and sadly our own leaders here in America, have just decided that America has had it too good for too long.
[01:02:16.397 --> 01:02:23.604]  America's been too rich and too happy and too successful and too free for too long, so it just has to end.
[01:02:23.744 --> 01:02:25.646]  Your joyride's coming to an end.
[01:02:25.986 --> 01:02:40.996]   There's too many people suffering on planet Earth, and so America, you've got it too good, and so it's now official world government policy to put Americans into bondage As a punishment, because we've had it too good.
[01:02:41.637 --> 01:02:47.821]  Well, instead, the world should be looking at America saying, wow, what is it about America that makes it so great?
[01:02:47.901 --> 01:02:49.282]  Maybe we should adopt that.
[01:02:49.882 --> 01:02:50.903]  It's the free market.
[01:02:51.063 --> 01:02:52.264]  It's small government.
[01:02:52.364 --> 01:02:53.405]  It's the Bill of Rights.
[01:02:53.505 --> 01:02:54.445]  It's the Constitution.
[01:02:54.465 --> 01:02:55.266]  You can go on and on.
[01:02:56.533 --> 01:03:22.169]  So instead of adopting all the things that made America so amazing, that made it the best country to live in, that made it the most prosperous, that gave us the highest standard of living, that gave us the ease of access, that gave us all the innovation, that gave us the excess, instead of adopting that worldwide, instead they just say, no, America must pay for their success, so we're going to punish America for being so successful.
[01:03:24.249 --> 01:03:26.193]  So you may say, well, that doesn't make sense.
[01:03:27.476 --> 01:03:27.836]  You're right.
[01:03:29.073 --> 01:03:31.313]  But let's go to the next level of the psychology here.
[01:03:31.833 --> 01:03:41.215]  It does make sense when you're an atheist or a nihilist that believes now humans are a parasite on planet Earth.
[01:03:42.015 --> 01:03:44.616]  They may even believe that we were designed as a parasite.
[01:03:44.816 --> 01:03:46.736]  They may even believe that that's just our destiny.
[01:03:46.756 --> 01:03:48.857]  We're a parasite like a parasite that lives in you.
[01:03:49.517 --> 01:03:50.697]  Or a cancer that lives in you.
[01:03:50.757 --> 01:03:56.898]  So they've decided that humanity has to be called off the planet Earth or there won't be a planet Earth.
[01:03:57.910 --> 01:04:04.694]  And that's when the climate change comes in, which is just a buzzword, just another big narrative lie to bring in the tyranny.
[01:04:05.395 --> 01:04:10.198]  So that's the mental thought process of the New World Order.
[01:04:10.738 --> 01:04:13.720]  That's the thought process of the global government.
[01:04:14.201 --> 01:04:16.142]  That's why we're going through everything we're going through.
[01:04:18.015 --> 01:04:22.956]  That's why you hear Michael Spector with Anthony Fauci saying we need more death.
[01:04:23.676 --> 01:04:24.976]  That's what, literally, he says that.
[01:04:25.156 --> 01:04:27.117]  I mean, it sounds crazy me saying that on air.
[01:04:27.137 --> 01:04:28.677]  We had a whole special report on it the other night.
[01:04:28.997 --> 01:04:32.858]  That's why you see articles like that saying I cheer on the extinction of mankind.
[01:04:33.138 --> 01:04:35.898]  That's why Bill Gates says we need to get the population down to zero.
[01:04:36.358 --> 01:04:37.799]  Because this is their ideology.
[01:04:37.839 --> 01:04:38.859]  This is what they believe in.
[01:04:40.639 --> 01:04:41.959]  And so you may believe in that too.
[01:04:42.339 --> 01:04:42.880]  You may not.
[01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:45.280]  You're going to be subjected to it.
[01:04:46.553 --> 01:04:48.414]  And so here's the real world breakdown.
[01:04:50.175 --> 01:04:54.758]  Pete Buttigieg's inexperience exposed as supply chain breaks down.
[01:04:55.339 --> 01:04:56.119]  Story from the hill.
[01:04:56.459 --> 01:05:02.763]  And it's all about all the shipments and all the containers and all the cargo and all the oil sitting off coast, not being allowed to come in.
[01:05:02.783 --> 01:05:10.568]  And they act like, oh, this is because Pete Buttigieg is inexperienced and he just can't do the job.
[01:05:10.948 --> 01:05:11.389]  Wrong.
[01:05:11.769 --> 01:05:29.948]   He was told We'll give you this job, do exactly what we say, you'll climb the ranks in the Democrat Party, you obviously have presidential aspirations, so all you gotta do is fill this chair, take this name placard, and just do nothing or do exactly what we say.
[01:05:30.008 --> 01:05:33.990]  So, he'll get scapegoated for the supply chain shortage, but it's not his fault.
[01:05:34.490 --> 01:05:35.710]  He's just doing what he's told.
[01:05:35.770 --> 01:05:37.831]  He's just a good foot soldier of the Democrat Party now.
[01:05:39.150 --> 01:05:43.172]  So yes, that's part of the impact of the global government, by design.
[01:05:43.472 --> 01:05:45.773]  Supply chain shortage in the West.
[01:05:46.853 --> 01:05:48.434]  White House asks U.S.
[01:05:49.114 --> 01:05:57.617]  oil and gas companies to help lower fuel costs because they're rising significantly because Joe Biden has a policy to shut U.S.
[01:05:57.757 --> 01:05:59.258]  oil down, and he did that.
[01:05:59.678 --> 01:06:02.219]  And by the way, the oil companies aren't going to respond to this.
[01:06:03.769 --> 01:06:09.176]  You saw Putin came out the other day and said, yeah, we're going to be looking at a future where there's $100 a barrel oil.
[01:06:09.856 --> 01:06:15.383]  Because the oil companies are going to continue living the way that they live and pricing things the way they price.
[01:06:15.684 --> 01:06:18.187]  They don't give a damn what the government says.
[01:06:19.448 --> 01:06:20.570]  So you can say, hey, they're good.
[01:06:20.610 --> 01:06:21.250]  Hey, they're bad.
[01:06:21.591 --> 01:06:23.073]  They're just doing business as usual.
[01:06:25.652 --> 01:06:29.714]  Winter heating bills set to jump as inflation hits home.
[01:06:30.634 --> 01:06:32.555]  So you may have seen that a little bit last year.
[01:06:32.795 --> 01:06:35.336]  It's going to be even worse this year.
[01:06:35.956 --> 01:06:44.740]  They may even shut you down and limit how much natural gas or how much electricity you can use by the end of this year.
[01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:46.381]  They already do that in California.
[01:06:46.621 --> 01:06:48.141]  They already tried to do that in Texas.
[01:06:48.922 --> 01:06:50.042]  So that's going to be the new normal.
[01:06:50.282 --> 01:06:53.403]   You go to turn the heat on at your house, Nothing happens.
[01:06:53.423 --> 01:06:54.304]  You say, what's happening?
[01:06:54.344 --> 01:06:55.085]  My heat doesn't work.
[01:06:55.385 --> 01:06:56.907]  You call the repairman.
[01:06:56.947 --> 01:06:58.609]  They say, no, no, no, your heat works just fine.
[01:06:59.491 --> 01:07:05.258]  They've shut it down at the facility that provides the heat because the government told them to because of climate change.
[01:07:06.516 --> 01:07:09.878]  And then here's the fear-mongering campaign, just like they do with COVID.
[01:07:10.819 --> 01:07:15.742]  See how climate change could put coastal cities, two-thirds of the world's population, underwater.
[01:07:15.862 --> 01:07:16.442]  NBC News.
[01:07:16.882 --> 01:07:28.169]  And if you guys can, before we go to the break here, 30 seconds, pull it up because they have these graphics that they show of all these cities underwater, and baseball stadiums underwater, and people drowning, and that's the fear-mongering.
[01:07:28.669 --> 01:07:30.831]  They've been predicting this for decades!
[01:07:32.128 --> 01:07:39.071]  They had to take all the signs that says these glaciers will be melted by 2020 out of the National Parks, the Glacier National Parks, because they didn't melt.
[01:07:40.071 --> 01:07:42.352]  Go watch Al Gore's documentary, Inconvenient Truth.
[01:07:42.612 --> 01:07:44.153]  We were all supposed to be drowned by now.
[01:07:44.513 --> 01:07:45.894]  They've been lying about this for decades.
[01:07:45.914 --> 01:07:48.975]  They still do it because they're still out there and nobody checks them on it.
[01:07:49.635 --> 01:07:51.576]  So, uh, doing some internet research here.
[01:07:51.596 --> 01:07:55.838]  We were trying to figure out how long do demons live?
[01:07:57.078 --> 01:07:59.719]  So we plugged that on into a search engine here.
[01:07:59.759 --> 01:08:01.100]  How long do demons live?
[01:08:02.435 --> 01:08:03.335]  We got the results.
[01:08:03.355 --> 01:08:07.017]  Apparently demons live for 1,500 years.
[01:08:08.418 --> 01:08:13.140]  And so just to figure out what we're in store for, we tried to figure out how old is Nancy Pelosi?
[01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:14.441]  Only 80 years old.
[01:08:14.681 --> 01:08:15.221]  Oh, no.
[01:08:15.642 --> 01:08:16.162]  Oh, God.
[01:08:18.443 --> 01:08:19.263]  Oh, it's too bad.
[01:08:19.283 --> 01:08:21.544]  It's a long time.
[01:08:22.425 --> 01:08:24.326]  So here is Pelosi.
[01:08:27.987 --> 01:08:34.170]  Talking about Build Back Better and how the climate tyranny is on the horizon.
[01:08:38.391 --> 01:08:40.632]  The Build Back Better is three baskets.
[01:08:40.712 --> 01:09:00.720]   It's climate, which we spent some time talking about already, health, jobs, security, and moral responsibility, health care, the issues that relate to the Affordable Care Act, Medicare and Medicaid, and Family care, I mentioned some of those issues already.
[01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:05.141]  And so whatever we do, it will be transformative.
[01:09:05.181 --> 01:09:06.342]  It will produce results.
[01:09:06.462 --> 01:09:21.106]  And we are very grateful to our president for saying, I want to pass the bipartisan legislation on infrastructure, but I will not confine my vision for the future to what can be in that bill.
[01:09:21.666 --> 01:09:23.466]  Hence, we need to build back better.
[01:09:26.172 --> 01:09:27.677]  We need the Build Back Better.
[01:09:27.717 --> 01:09:28.299]  We need it.
[01:09:29.001 --> 01:09:29.823]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:09:30.706 --> 01:09:32.953]  What do you think life would be like if these people just...
[01:09:34.437 --> 01:09:34.877]  Went away?
[01:09:35.597 --> 01:09:37.138]  Just weren't in our lives anymore?
[01:09:37.158 --> 01:09:37.938]  Weren't in government anymore?
[01:09:37.958 --> 01:09:38.679]  Do you think we'd be okay?
[01:09:38.699 --> 01:09:39.559]  Do you think we'd survive?
[01:09:39.579 --> 01:09:40.459]  Do you think we'd be alright?
[01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:43.260]  Yeah, we'd be much better off, actually.
[01:09:43.681 --> 01:09:44.641]  We'd be much better off.
[01:09:45.281 --> 01:09:59.147]  So, Pelosi's been in government for five decades, Biden's been in government for five decades, they've been telling you they're gonna do the same thing for five decades, and yet they haven't done it, but somehow their wealth has massively increased!
[01:10:01.488 --> 01:10:02.348]  Isn't that amazing?
[01:10:03.908 --> 01:10:07.291]  Oh, we're going to fix healthcare, we're going to fix this, we're going to fix that, we're going to do all this stuff.
[01:10:07.611 --> 01:10:09.433]  And they keep telling you that for 50 years.
[01:10:09.613 --> 01:10:10.334]  They've never done it.
[01:10:10.474 --> 01:10:11.515]  All that's only gotten worse.
[01:10:11.615 --> 01:10:13.657]  But their bank accounts sure have grown a lot.
[01:10:15.038 --> 01:10:16.459]  Your freedoms have been stripped away.
[01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:23.705]  The average American's income is not going up like Pelosi's and Biden's is.
[01:10:25.427 --> 01:10:27.949]  But they say they have the moral responsibility.
[01:10:28.370 --> 01:10:29.270]  And that's their cover.
[01:10:29.310 --> 01:10:30.131]  That's their guise.
[01:10:30.171 --> 01:10:30.872]  That's their cape.
[01:10:32.898 --> 01:10:35.219]  The moral responsibility to run your life.
[01:10:35.279 --> 01:10:37.619]  The moral responsibility to tell you how to live.
[01:10:37.919 --> 01:10:40.200]  The moral responsibility to tax you more.
[01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:44.321]  The moral responsibility to stop you from driving a car or getting on an airplane.
[01:10:44.561 --> 01:10:47.141]  The moral responsibility to stop you from having kids.
[01:10:47.201 --> 01:10:50.002]  It's a moral responsibility of Pelosi to run your life.
[01:10:50.022 --> 01:10:50.642]  Don't you know that?
[01:10:51.282 --> 01:10:51.882]  She's God.
[01:10:52.062 --> 01:10:53.182]  She's in charge of your life now.
[01:10:54.363 --> 01:10:55.083]  That's what she says.
[01:10:56.650 --> 01:11:03.397]  But Biden and Pelosi can have enormous wealth growth while they work in government.
[01:11:05.239 --> 01:11:11.026]  And yet the IRS says they want to look at any bank account that has more than $600 in it, any transactions.
[01:11:12.127 --> 01:11:12.948]  So you do the math.
[01:11:14.124 --> 01:11:21.229]  By the way, I asked the crowd, I was like, hey, because the original stories were Biden hires 91,000 new IRS workers.
[01:11:21.329 --> 01:11:22.509]  Well, they did fact checks on that.
[01:11:22.589 --> 01:11:23.050]  Guys, it's only 87,000.
[01:11:23.190 --> 01:11:26.972]  It's only 87,000 new workers at the IRS.
[01:11:27.473 --> 01:11:33.356]  And then, and then Yellen says, we're going to be monitoring bank accounts with more than $600 in it.
[01:11:34.717 --> 01:11:35.858]  Can you do the math on that?
[01:11:37.579 --> 01:11:42.802]  Why would they have to hire all of these people if they were just going after billionaires?
[01:11:42.822 --> 01:11:47.441]   I think there's like, Maybe 600 billionaires in the US?
[01:11:48.082 --> 01:11:48.342]  Maybe?
[01:11:48.362 --> 01:11:53.448]  Guys, see how many billionaires there are and millionaires there are in the United States.
[01:11:53.488 --> 01:11:55.910]  I think there's like maybe 600 billionaires?
[01:11:56.010 --> 01:11:57.092]  Maybe I'm over-exaggerating that.
[01:11:57.152 --> 01:11:58.093]  Let's find out here.
[01:12:01.236 --> 01:12:03.398]  Oh, the IRS is coming after people with $600.
[01:12:03.818 --> 01:12:06.200]  There's a lot of tax fraud and cheating that's going on.
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:07.481]  Yeah, I agree.
[01:12:07.581 --> 01:12:08.762]  Let's look at Joe Biden.
[01:12:09.062 --> 01:12:10.323]  Let's look at Nancy Pelosi.
[01:12:10.343 --> 01:12:14.586]  Let's look at Maxine Waters, whose husband runs a bank that got millions in bailout money.
[01:12:15.046 --> 01:12:21.031]  Let's look at the politicians that are making millions of dollars hand over fist while their salaries are a couple hundred thousand a year.
[01:12:22.532 --> 01:12:24.433]  So we have 614 billionaires in the United States.
[01:12:27.156 --> 01:12:27.556]  Okay.
[01:12:27.996 --> 01:12:29.737]  How many millionaires do we have, guys?
[01:12:29.757 --> 01:12:31.758]  See how many millionaires there are in the United States?
[01:12:32.579 --> 01:12:38.021]  Obviously that number is going to be a lot higher, but I still doubt that it's 87,000.
[01:12:38.121 --> 01:12:38.662]  Maybe it is.
[01:12:40.523 --> 01:12:41.283]  Let's see here, though.
[01:12:42.564 --> 01:12:43.504]  How many millionaires?
[01:12:44.084 --> 01:12:45.125]  Oh, we have a... Oh, wow!
[01:12:45.145 --> 01:12:46.165]  We have a lot of millionaires.
[01:12:49.167 --> 01:12:50.508]  Oh, that... Okay, so...
[01:12:52.859 --> 01:12:59.224]  I guess though, and of course Pelosi and Biden are included in that 18 million millionaires that we have in the United States.
[01:12:59.264 --> 01:12:59.985]  Hey, that's a good thing.
[01:13:00.005 --> 01:13:00.846]  We need rich people.
[01:13:00.886 --> 01:13:02.247]  They get the economy going.
[01:13:02.267 --> 01:13:03.368]  They hire people.
[01:13:03.608 --> 01:13:04.609]  They create jobs.
[01:13:04.889 --> 01:13:05.830]  They build the economy.
[01:13:06.811 --> 01:13:08.232]  I guess that's why the left hates them so much.
[01:13:08.872 --> 01:13:14.477]  But I don't think these 87,000 or however many thousand IRS workers are going to be going after Biden and Pelosi.
[01:13:14.917 --> 01:13:18.300]  I don't think they're going to be going after the billionaires either, because they're in bed with them.
[01:13:19.561 --> 01:13:20.382]  The government, that is.
[01:13:21.752 --> 01:13:23.073]  They're all tax-exempt anyway.
[01:13:24.293 --> 01:13:32.416]  And it's funny because they say, oh, the rich don't pay their fair share of taxes, and it's all the leftist, it's the wealthy leftist that are tax-exempt.
[01:13:33.537 --> 01:13:37.758]  In fact, guys, wasn't it Google that didn't pay a dime in taxes like two years ago or something?
[01:13:39.439 --> 01:13:56.728]   So they say, oh, we're going to go against the millionaires and the billionaires, but then as soon as the millionaires and billionaires become public Democrats, And liberals, all of a sudden they don't pay taxes and of course they don't get the scrutiny of the liberal left either.
[01:13:57.129 --> 01:13:58.252]  They're just going to come after you.
[01:13:58.332 --> 01:13:59.234]  So what do you think the...
[01:14:00.305 --> 01:14:05.088]  What do you think the Silicon Valley avoids over $100 billion in taxes over the last decade?
[01:14:05.388 --> 01:14:06.289]  Yeah, no kidding.
[01:14:06.649 --> 01:14:09.931]  And you really think the new IRS is going to go after them?
[01:14:10.111 --> 01:14:10.712]  Of course not.
[01:14:10.752 --> 01:14:12.533]  They're going after you.
[01:14:13.113 --> 01:14:16.395]  They don't like that you made a couple thousand dollars in cryptocurrency.
[01:14:17.036 --> 01:14:22.199]  They don't like that you're using Venmo to transfer funds back and forth or some other cash app.
[01:14:22.519 --> 01:14:23.340]  They don't like that.
[01:14:23.660 --> 01:14:24.861]  They want to get involved in that.
[01:14:25.081 --> 01:14:26.122]  They got to get their cut.
[01:14:27.841 --> 01:14:32.046]  It's kind of like here in Texas and it's probably the same way around the country I would imagine.
[01:14:32.967 --> 01:14:45.502]  Let's say I have a car and I want to give my car to somebody else, whether it be a family member or a friend or whoever, I want to give them this vehicle.
[01:14:46.162 --> 01:14:46.483]  Okay.
[01:14:47.895 --> 01:14:49.736]  Well, let's say the government values the car at $25,000.
[01:14:50.036 --> 01:14:52.678]  Well, I just want to give them the car.
[01:14:52.718 --> 01:14:53.739]  I'm going to gift them the car.
[01:14:53.759 --> 01:14:58.122]  There's all sorts of legal documents you have to fill to gift a car.
[01:14:58.162 --> 01:14:59.323]  You can't even just give somebody a car.
[01:14:59.343 --> 01:15:00.744]  The government's got to be involved in that, too.
[01:15:01.824 --> 01:15:11.010]  And then they come down, and they have the government appraise the car's value, and then you have to pay a tax on a $0 transfer.
[01:15:12.151 --> 01:15:15.954]  I give somebody a car, they have to pay a tax on the car.
[01:15:18.612 --> 01:15:20.572]  So the government is now involved in gift-giving.
[01:15:21.013 --> 01:15:23.413]  Same thing with the estate tax that I think Trump ended.
[01:15:23.433 --> 01:15:31.535]  I don't think it's been brought back, but it's like, you die, you leave land to your kid, you leave an inheritance to your kid, the government takes money out of that.
[01:15:32.735 --> 01:15:33.516]  That is ludicrous.
[01:15:33.556 --> 01:15:34.376]  That is ridiculous.
[01:15:34.816 --> 01:15:44.058]  And now they want even more access to your finances, more access to your bank account, more access to your life, so they can take more of your money.
[01:15:45.319 --> 01:15:52.282]   And this just goes along with the precedent That's being said with the global government COVID tyranny that the government runs your life.
[01:15:52.342 --> 01:15:54.282]  It's normal for the government to be in your pocket.
[01:15:54.783 --> 01:15:56.723]  It's normal for the government to be in your pants.
[01:15:57.064 --> 01:15:59.184]  It's normal for the government to be in your body.
[01:15:59.605 --> 01:16:01.705]  It's normal for the government to be in your house.
[01:16:02.446 --> 01:16:04.587]  That's what it's all about, don't you know?
[01:16:04.647 --> 01:16:05.987]  That's the life we want to live.
[01:16:06.287 --> 01:16:07.548]  That's the planet we're building.
[01:16:10.989 --> 01:16:11.649]  I don't know.
[01:16:12.610 --> 01:16:15.431]  I feel like the government shouldn't be involved in any of that.
[01:16:16.997 --> 01:16:21.199]  And I'd think that would be popular, but something has changed in the left.
[01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:24.761]  Something diabolical has happened to the left.
[01:16:24.861 --> 01:16:27.943]  Something really twisted and evil has happened to the left.
[01:16:28.423 --> 01:16:29.844]  They used to be for small government.
[01:16:31.285 --> 01:16:32.465]  They used to be against war.
[01:16:33.766 --> 01:16:34.847]  Now they're all for it.
[01:16:35.187 --> 01:16:37.928]  They used to be for medical freedom, my body, my choice.
[01:16:38.468 --> 01:16:39.429]  Now they're all for it.
[01:16:39.529 --> 01:16:40.610]  What has happened?
[01:16:41.930 --> 01:16:42.771]  What happened?
[01:16:46.650 --> 01:16:47.290]  But guess what?
[01:16:48.190 --> 01:16:48.730]  They're going to do it.
[01:16:50.111 --> 01:16:53.231]  The IRS is going to find a way to harass everybody they possibly can.
[01:16:54.452 --> 01:17:00.933]  The Democrat Party is going to find a way to limit your access to resources and limit your access to finances and limit your access to freedom.
[01:17:00.993 --> 01:17:01.393]  They'll do it.
[01:17:01.413 --> 01:17:03.354]  They're going to find a way because nobody's stopping them.
[01:17:05.094 --> 01:17:06.474]  Nobody's stopping them.
[01:17:07.955 --> 01:17:12.976]  And sadly, Infowars is like a voice in the wilderness, like an island out here in media.
[01:17:16.073 --> 01:17:20.838]  And look, I get it, people go, oh wow, so great Joe Rogan and Goop to go on the air together.
[01:17:21.999 --> 01:17:23.981]  And yeah, that is good, but that wasn't even a real debate.
[01:17:24.661 --> 01:17:28.545]  The left must be savaged in an intellectual debate.
[01:17:29.306 --> 01:17:33.509]  All of their policies, all of their ideologies must be savaged.
[01:17:34.230 --> 01:17:38.011]  Annihilated in an actual intellectual political debate.
[01:17:38.331 --> 01:17:39.631]  But you notice you don't have the debate.
[01:17:40.072 --> 01:17:43.873]  You have a conversation with Rogan and Gupta and that like blows up as the big debate.
[01:17:43.953 --> 01:17:44.733]  It's not even a debate.
[01:17:45.273 --> 01:17:46.093]  There is no debate.
[01:17:46.873 --> 01:17:52.055]  It's the left dominating you with the corporate government that they run, as they claim to be anti-big corporations.
[01:17:53.575 --> 01:17:55.596]  So that's why you must fund InfoWars, folks.
[01:17:57.696 --> 01:18:00.877]  Because we don't celebrate telling the truth.
[01:18:01.994 --> 01:18:10.756]  We do it because it needs to be done, not as an act of, look at me, but as an act of defiance against the New World Order.
[01:18:10.796 --> 01:18:17.358]  So, InfoWarsTore.com, big specials, but only three days left on the big sales at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:18:18.519 --> 01:18:20.179]  You know, I'm not sure where this was posted.
[01:18:20.239 --> 01:18:27.821]  It looks like it was some street art, but somebody put this on a chalkboard somewhere out on the street.
[01:18:28.201 --> 01:18:29.222]  I figured it was worth reading.
[01:18:29.262 --> 01:18:32.218]   I thought it was pretty Pretty well laid out.
[01:18:32.879 --> 01:18:41.289]  Dear Globalists, we the people have reviewed your proposal for the Great Reset and we regret to inform you that we will have to decline at this time.
[01:18:41.809 --> 01:18:48.437]  Although we did find the free trial of the New World Order very interesting, we have decided instead to go with the Great Awakening.
[01:18:48.797 --> 01:18:50.399]  Yours sincerely, The Human Race.
[01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:55.743]  And while that is the case, the New World Order doesn't care what you say or think.
[01:18:55.943 --> 01:18:57.304]  It gets to dominate you.
[01:18:57.524 --> 01:18:59.745]  Because that's what Nancy Pelosi said.
[01:19:00.166 --> 01:19:01.346]  That's their moral decision.
[01:19:01.366 --> 01:19:03.868]  That's their moral duty, is to run your life.
[01:19:03.948 --> 01:19:06.970]  Because they're better than you, even though they're the biggest criminals in the world.
[01:19:09.428 --> 01:19:14.111]  But I wanted to go to this clip from Bloomberg, and you know, I was actually surprised.
[01:19:14.171 --> 01:19:16.212]  Normally this Bloomberg host is pretty centrist.
[01:19:16.232 --> 01:19:23.796]  She mostly just does economic stuff, and I knew she was kind of a liberal based off some of her coverage, but she hasn't really let it be known.
[01:19:23.876 --> 01:19:31.420]  Normally she's pretty just neutral when she does her coverage, but boy did she come out of the closet for this interview with David Sachs.
[01:19:33.078 --> 01:19:38.261]  As she attacks relentlessly Ron DeSantis and Sachs basically won't have any of it.
[01:19:39.101 --> 01:19:44.664]  Here was the Bloomberg interview with, I think her name is, I want to say Emily Brown.
[01:19:44.684 --> 01:19:45.524]  I forget her name though.
[01:19:45.664 --> 01:19:47.665]  Anyway, normally pretty neutral.
[01:19:47.686 --> 01:19:51.808]  You wouldn't know what her politics were, but boy, she came out of the bag in this interview.
[01:19:51.848 --> 01:19:52.248]  Check it out.
[01:19:53.635 --> 01:19:59.599]  I do want to ask you about the fundraiser you're hosting for Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who obviously is a very divisive figure.
[01:20:00.899 --> 01:20:01.920]  See the propaganda there?
[01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:04.802]  Just, oh, DeSantis, obviously a divisive figure.
[01:20:05.748 --> 01:20:07.609]  No, no, you lie about Ron DeSantis.
[01:20:07.789 --> 01:20:08.910]  So they're never divisive.
[01:20:08.930 --> 01:20:14.332]  They lie, they contort, they demonize, they censor, but they're never divisive.
[01:20:14.413 --> 01:20:15.093]  Never them.
[01:20:15.473 --> 01:20:16.654]  They're never divisive.
[01:20:16.694 --> 01:20:17.214]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:20:17.474 --> 01:20:18.695]  Only you're divisive.
[01:20:18.975 --> 01:20:21.056]  Only the people they disagree with are divisive.
[01:20:21.316 --> 01:20:23.097]  Only the opposition to them are divisive.
[01:20:23.277 --> 01:20:23.957]  Not them.
[01:20:24.238 --> 01:20:25.818]  Not them imposing mandates.
[01:20:26.079 --> 01:20:27.539]  Not them imposing their will.
[01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:29.680]  Not them lying about and demonizing you.
[01:20:29.761 --> 01:20:30.841]  No, they're never divisive.
[01:20:30.881 --> 01:20:31.421]  It's only you.
[01:20:32.602 --> 01:20:34.162]  You're obviously divisive, Ron DeSantis.
[01:20:34.442 --> 01:20:37.583]  You're just putting that out there as if it's a matter of fact, and it's not!
[01:20:38.043 --> 01:20:40.344]  But here you go, continue.
[01:20:40.964 --> 01:20:46.926]  When it comes to public health, I know that you don't necessarily agree with all of them, but why do you support such a divisive?
[01:20:46.946 --> 01:20:48.406]  He's so divisive.
[01:20:48.486 --> 01:20:52.327]  Especially given the global health crisis we are still facing.
[01:20:52.827 --> 01:20:53.687]  Pause it right there.
[01:20:53.727 --> 01:20:54.668]  So notice what she does here.
[01:20:54.808 --> 01:20:57.048]  Oh, it's just a matter of fact DeSantis is divisive.
[01:20:57.268 --> 01:20:59.049]  What, because he believes in personal choice and freedom?
[01:20:59.069 --> 01:20:59.769]  That's divisive now?
[01:21:00.899 --> 01:21:02.101]  And then they just continue the big lie.
[01:21:02.321 --> 01:21:03.943]  The global pandemic we're facing!
[01:21:06.366 --> 01:21:12.194]  Just, you know, they'll repeat the big lie over and over and over until they believe it, until everybody believes it, which we never will because we're not stupid, but here you go.
[01:21:13.128 --> 01:21:16.768]   apparently more divisive than say Gavin Newsom or someone on the other side of the spectrum.
[01:21:16.768 --> 01:21:20.528]   See what I would argue is that words like polarizing and divisiveness,
[01:21:20.528 --> 01:21:27.547]   they assume a normative baseline in which everybody agrees, everyone in the tech industry agrees because they all come
[01:21:27.547 --> 01:21:29.527]  from a certain information bubble.
[01:21:29.527 --> 01:21:33.228]   And anyone who deviates from that orthodoxy is perceived as divisive.
[01:21:33.228 --> 01:21:37.048]   I would argue that there- And pause it right there real quick too, because you notice
[01:21:37.048 --> 01:21:37.528]  what he just said.
[01:21:37.558 --> 01:21:39.419]  He says these people come from a bubble.
[01:21:39.799 --> 01:21:42.380]  Sanjay Gupta is the perfect example if you take him at his word.
[01:21:42.660 --> 01:21:44.201]  He knew nothing of ivermectin.
[01:21:44.381 --> 01:21:46.042]  He knew nothing of vaccine side effects.
[01:21:46.062 --> 01:21:47.482]  He knew nothing of natural immunity.
[01:21:47.683 --> 01:21:50.524]  He knows none of this because he lives in a bubble, or he's a liar.
[01:21:50.564 --> 01:21:51.244]  But that's what he's saying.
[01:21:51.264 --> 01:21:52.285]  He's saying these people live in a bubble.
[01:21:52.485 --> 01:21:52.865]  Continue.
[01:21:53.285 --> 01:21:59.788]  There's a multiplicity of views, and you're not divisive just because you don't agree with the orthodoxy of Silicon Valley.
[01:22:02.543 --> 01:22:06.911]  So, but why DeSantis over many of the other candidates who you could host fundraisers for?
[01:22:06.931 --> 01:22:14.625]  I mean, I know you're bullish on Florida, but DeSantis and Mayor Suarez, who was actually on the show earlier this hour, are on different ends of the spectrum.
[01:22:15.532 --> 01:22:18.734]  I've donated to Suarez too, but I like both of them.
[01:22:18.914 --> 01:22:23.217]  I like Suarez because he's been extremely welcoming towards the tech ecosystem in Miami.
[01:22:23.237 --> 01:22:24.478]  I think that's a smart strategy.
[01:22:24.558 --> 01:22:27.460]  I don't get why the politicians in San Francisco don't do that.
[01:22:28.221 --> 01:22:29.942]  I mean, they're killing the golden goose.
[01:22:30.062 --> 01:22:35.126]  In terms of why I like DeSantis, he was the first governor to stop these insane lockdowns.
[01:22:35.746 --> 01:22:41.870]  And, you know, he found the right policy on lockdowns, which was to stop them, and he did it despite an extremely hostile media.
[01:22:41.930 --> 01:22:42.650]  So I respect that.
[01:22:42.690 --> 01:22:49.395]  When somebody takes the right position on an issue, despite the hostility of the media, that's something I can really respect.
[01:22:49.435 --> 01:22:50.175]  That's why I support it.
[01:22:54.929 --> 01:22:56.909]  You're not allowed to support someone that's not a Democrat.
[01:22:57.710 --> 01:22:58.930]  And if you do, you're divisive.
[01:22:58.950 --> 01:23:00.190]  Because we said they're divisive.
[01:23:00.450 --> 01:23:02.171]  It doesn't matter, we lie about them all the time.
[01:23:02.191 --> 01:23:04.731]  And it doesn't matter that we want to run everybody's life.
[01:23:05.451 --> 01:23:06.351]  That's just what we do.
[01:23:06.451 --> 01:23:07.932]  You're divisive if you don't like it.
[01:23:08.152 --> 01:23:09.652]  And you should only do what we say.
[01:23:09.732 --> 01:23:11.253]  We're the liberals in charge of your life.
[01:23:12.753 --> 01:23:13.153]  Thank you.
[01:23:14.613 --> 01:23:20.975]  Alexandria Stein.
[01:23:20.995 --> 01:23:22.335]  Mr. Stein?
[01:23:22.375 --> 01:23:22.555]  Yes?
[01:23:25.031 --> 01:23:28.322]  We addressed it in council on September...
[01:23:29.824 --> 01:23:30.865]  No, that's incorrect.
[01:23:30.905 --> 01:23:37.228]  Ladies and gentlemen of the City Council, I'm here for a lot of reasons, so let me get started.
[01:23:37.248 --> 01:23:38.969]  Not the Governor, not Donald Trump.
[01:23:38.829 --> 01:23:41.549]  No, that's not me.
[01:23:41.549 --> 01:23:43.029]   Ladies and gentlemen of the city council,
[01:23:43.029 --> 01:23:44.109]  I'm here for a lot of reasons.
[01:23:44.109 --> 01:23:46.469]  So let me get started.
[01:23:46.469 --> 01:23:47.829]  Not the governor, not Donald.
[01:23:47.829 --> 01:23:51.268]  What are you talking about?
[01:23:51.268 --> 01:23:53.909]  Point of order, Mr. Mayor.
[01:23:53.909 --> 01:23:54.868]  Why can't I speak?
[01:23:54.868 --> 01:23:56.028]  We've spoken before.
[01:23:56.028 --> 01:23:56.528]  What?
[01:23:56.528 --> 01:23:57.589]  We'll take you down.
[01:23:57.589 --> 01:23:59.188]  Walk out.
[01:23:59.188 --> 01:24:02.269]  Why can't I speak?
[01:24:02.269 --> 01:24:03.789]   Please state your point of order.
[01:24:03.789 --> 01:24:04.708]  When can I speak?
[01:24:04.708 --> 01:24:07.469]   The city secretary said this gentleman has spoken before.
[01:24:07.469 --> 01:24:11.469]  be rewarded for staying out of our rules. Yeah. So that is...
[01:24:12.253 --> 01:24:22.955]  My guest, or it might be my guest, I'm not really sure, this is a, I believe, a gender-fluid individual here, so I gotta make sure to handle this correctly, but Alex Stein is my guest.
[01:24:22.975 --> 01:24:34.037]  So I think we do have Alex Stein with us today, who's also spoken at City Council, not Alexandria Stein, that is his other gender identity.
[01:24:34.637 --> 01:24:37.758]  And so, you know, Alex, let me just start it off with this.
[01:24:38.738 --> 01:24:50.910]  Why is it that your right to be gender fluid is being denied, but if you were somebody else, I have a feeling that that would be considered a hate crime to deny Alexandria the right to speak that day.
[01:24:50.950 --> 01:24:51.931]  How do you make sense of this?
[01:24:53.032 --> 01:24:54.453]  Well, this is how it works.
[01:24:54.634 --> 01:24:56.856]  I lost my genitalia in a weightlifting accident.
[01:24:57.435 --> 01:25:00.777]  I was encouraged to get the gender reassignment surgery in 80.
[01:25:01.318 --> 01:25:07.662]  And I did that under the guise that I thought it would, you know, help me out with job opportunities, with speaking in city council.
[01:25:07.902 --> 01:25:12.285]  But unfortunately, living a life as a trans person, Owen, is not easy.
[01:25:12.345 --> 01:25:19.650]  So for me, I think I'd rather just, I kind of, you know, I like to put on the suit and remember a time back when I still had my genitalia as a man.
[01:25:20.551 --> 01:25:24.734]  So you're now a victim, you are now a victim of transphobia.
[01:25:26.125 --> 01:25:30.467]  100%.
[01:25:26.185 --> 01:25:30.467]  And that's the problem is, you know, we live in a society where they're all hypocrites.
[01:25:30.868 --> 01:25:31.888]  Everybody's a hypocrite.
[01:25:31.908 --> 01:25:33.329]  Everybody wants to say they're inclusive.
[01:25:33.849 --> 01:25:34.490]  They're not.
[01:25:34.570 --> 01:25:38.672]  But we know, Owen, we can sit here, we can joke around all day about Transphobia.
[01:25:38.692 --> 01:25:39.792]  But this is what I want to say to you.
[01:25:39.852 --> 01:25:40.793]  I'm such a fan of you.
[01:25:40.853 --> 01:25:46.216]  But what happened to you with January 6 is the biggest travesty in this entire country.
[01:25:46.256 --> 01:25:57.663]   The fact that they've weaponized our police force in order to be a domestic Uh, terrorist, uh, like you're a domestic terrorist, like you're some Islamic terrorist is the biggest travesty in the entire world.
[01:25:57.723 --> 01:26:03.088]  And I feel really sick that Donald Trump didn't bail you out or bail out the other people that got arrested.
[01:26:03.108 --> 01:26:04.729]  So I just want to say as a fan of yours, thank you.
[01:26:04.749 --> 01:26:07.091]  Cause you're the biggest, you're one of the biggest pictures I know.
[01:26:07.131 --> 01:26:15.978]  And for them to ever call you a terrorist is one of the most disgusting and incorrect labels and more incorrect than when they call me a man, when I'm really a woman.
[01:26:16.218 --> 01:26:17.519]  So that is a worst label.
[01:26:17.619 --> 01:26:19.640]  Well, let's get serious here for a second.
[01:26:19.660 --> 01:26:31.646]  I appreciate those kind words, and I actually was first introduced to you with your last visit to City Council when you broke down into hysteria about the abortion thing, which was just hilarious.
[01:26:31.686 --> 01:26:32.666]  That's how I was introduced to you.
[01:26:32.706 --> 01:26:33.587]  Your work is great, too.
[01:26:33.627 --> 01:26:34.847]  But I will just say this.
[01:26:35.468 --> 01:26:36.488]  I am in court tomorrow.
[01:26:36.528 --> 01:26:37.248]  It's a big day.
[01:26:37.308 --> 01:26:38.569]  I know a lot of people are praying for me.
[01:26:38.609 --> 01:26:42.251]  I'm not going to go much further into that, but just know I am in court for that tomorrow.
[01:26:42.911 --> 01:26:46.413]  And unfortunately, Trump is no longer in the office, so there's not much he can do.
[01:26:46.713 --> 01:26:49.034]  He is speaking out about these political prisoners now.
[01:26:49.615 --> 01:26:52.316]  But if people want to continue to pray for me, that means everything.
[01:26:52.856 --> 01:26:53.757]  Big day in court tomorrow.
[01:26:53.777 --> 01:26:55.458]  I will have an update tomorrow afternoon.
[01:26:55.498 --> 01:26:59.300]  But Alex, let's get serious here, because here's the thing.
[01:27:01.404 --> 01:27:17.356]  I've often wondered when you're going to start seeing people as a political statement, you know, say, okay, I'm going to be transgender and I'm going to be a golfer, or I'm going to be transgender and I'm going to be a basketball player, or I'm going to be a fighter, just to prove how ridiculous the whole thing is.
[01:27:17.656 --> 01:27:26.343]  And we've seen men fight women and crack their skulls in fights, and we've seen men play handball against women and dominate in basketball and all this stuff.
[01:27:26.683 --> 01:27:32.706]   But it seems like you're only allowed to do it It's like they do, somehow they do like a background check.
[01:27:32.966 --> 01:27:35.928]  You're only allowed to do that if you're a good progressive liberal.
[01:27:36.288 --> 01:27:38.949]  But if you're not and you try to do it, all of a sudden you're bad.
[01:27:39.009 --> 01:27:42.951]  Caitlyn Jender may be the wrong example, but I think the treatment of you is the perfect example.
[01:27:43.171 --> 01:27:52.575]  Where is the LGBTQIA plus-niner-62 tortoise-dolphin, where are they coming to protect you from the discrimination you faced?
[01:27:53.641 --> 01:27:56.364]  I'm begging for Justin Trudeau to swoop in and save me.
[01:27:56.384 --> 01:27:58.827]  I mean, Justin Trudeau is the hero that I need.
[01:27:59.127 --> 01:28:05.193]  He's trying to be, you know, he loves two LGBTQQTIAS+, and I agree with that.
[01:28:05.273 --> 01:28:08.957]  I love two LGBTQQQ2+, as well.
[01:28:09.218 --> 01:28:13.182]  So I'm just saying, it just sucks that we live in this world where our leaders are not standing up for us.
[01:28:13.502 --> 01:28:13.902]  You know that!
[01:28:14.262 --> 01:28:22.344]  I mean, you know we live under constant tyranny, and right now we're under literal medical tyranny, and your boss, Alex Jones, has been calling that out for a long time.
[01:28:22.404 --> 01:28:23.264]  It just sucks!
[01:28:23.604 --> 01:28:38.307]  I don't want to come on here and be, you know, some baby back page and say, you know, be a nihilist and say that the world is a terrible place, but unfortunately what is happening right now, that these people getting this vaccine, and if you die within two weeks of it, they're not considered an unvaccinated death.
[01:28:38.687 --> 01:29:04.971]   We're just in the biggest nightmare possible where now I tell my mom she has a cough I'm scared to make her go to the hospital and I tell my mom don't go to the hospital stay at home and can you believe you live in a nightmare now where I would tell my sick mother to stay away from a doctor because every single doctor is bought and sold by a multinational corporation And that they don't even care, they have no soul, and that's the problem with America is that we're run by multinational corporations, and these multinational corporations have a globalist viewpoint.
[01:29:05.011 --> 01:29:06.692]  They don't care about America, that's what they want.
[01:29:07.093 --> 01:29:17.059]  All the Haitians in the world up here, that's what they want to destabilize the nuclear family and make everything transgender, because this is all part of the globalization of the world, so that they have more control.
[01:29:17.119 --> 01:29:23.365]   And sadly, until we're stopped being run by Pfizer and Moderna, We're gonna live in a constant nightmare.
[01:29:23.725 --> 01:29:24.787]  You know that, I know that.
[01:29:24.606 --> 01:29:27.296]  that. It's really sad. You know that's it exactly though.
[01:29:27.296 --> 01:29:30.546]   That's why it's all about we the people or the power of the people because people
[01:29:30.546 --> 01:29:34.497]   have a soul or I guess you know maybe most people I don't know but people the idea
[01:29:34.497 --> 01:29:38.396]   is that people have a soul so there's that human touch whereas government
[01:29:38.396 --> 01:29:43.006]   bodies and corporations don't have a soul.
[01:29:41.228 --> 01:29:42.368]  There is no human touch.
[01:29:42.408 --> 01:29:47.390]  So railroading over humans, destroying people's lives, they just have no problem with that.
[01:29:47.810 --> 01:29:54.213]  But why is it, is that why you kind of chose to do more of a humorous kind of approach to all this madness?
[01:29:54.953 --> 01:29:58.955]  Because it's just so crazy that humor is the only way you try to get a word in?
[01:29:59.963 --> 01:30:01.965]  Dude, look at your boss, Alex Jones.
[01:30:02.005 --> 01:30:03.466]  What do you want to say about Alex Jones?
[01:30:03.506 --> 01:30:05.348]  Donald Trump is the greatest comedian in the world.
[01:30:05.488 --> 01:30:07.651]  Alex Jones is the number two comedian in the world.
[01:30:07.971 --> 01:30:08.832]  I'm not saying that.
[01:30:08.892 --> 01:30:10.033]  I'm not saying that facetiously.
[01:30:10.053 --> 01:30:11.274]  He's funnier than Howard Stern.
[01:30:11.294 --> 01:30:12.395]  He's funnier than Jimmy Kimmel.
[01:30:12.615 --> 01:30:16.719]  Because you have to be funny because that's the only way you break through the trauma-based mind control.
[01:30:16.940 --> 01:30:18.061]  You turn on CNN.
[01:30:18.361 --> 01:30:19.422]  There's a death scroller.
[01:30:19.462 --> 01:30:20.523]  How many people have died?
[01:30:20.743 --> 01:30:21.544]  There's an age of death.
[01:30:21.884 --> 01:30:33.288]  If you're a normal person, close to the nature, and you're constantly under trauma-based mind control, the only way to break through that thick, coated, candy, M&M, peanut shell of your brain is with humor.
[01:30:33.308 --> 01:30:39.129]  Because, like I said, the trauma-based mind control has everyone under hypnosis.
[01:30:39.329 --> 01:30:43.771]  And the only way to break out of it is when a hypnotist tells you to snap your fingers or make you laugh.
[01:30:43.990 --> 01:30:48.789]   You literally have to do that because that's the only way to get through these people because the problem is
[01:30:48.789 --> 01:30:51.511]  we are stuck, we get addicted to the cortisol release.
[01:30:51.511 --> 01:30:57.070]   So we read the ticker, we see somebody dies, and what that does is that creates this non-serotonin,
[01:30:57.070 --> 01:31:00.070]  this cortisol release that we get addicted to, so it's sad.
[01:31:00.070 --> 01:31:02.791]  So without the humor, I try to be serious.
[01:31:02.791 --> 01:31:05.670]  I try to wake people up, but this is the problem.
[01:31:05.670 --> 01:31:07.670]  I always make this point, let me make this point real quick.
[01:31:07.670 --> 01:31:10.990]   A&W Hamburgers or A&W Rubio, they try to get the hamburger business.
[01:31:10.990 --> 01:31:13.029]  Let me tell this story real quick.
[01:31:13.029 --> 01:31:15.270]  They did a market survey, a worldwide survey.
[01:31:15.243 --> 01:31:16.544]  They wanted to compete with McDonald's.
[01:31:16.565 --> 01:31:17.325]  This is in the 80s.
[01:31:17.345 --> 01:31:18.066]  You can look this up.
[01:31:18.366 --> 01:31:21.169]  And what they did is they asked individuals what they thought was a better value.
[01:31:21.429 --> 01:31:27.495]  The quarter pounder burger for $4.99 or the third pounder burger for $4.79.
[01:31:27.936 --> 01:31:34.482]  And overwhelmingly, people picked the quarter pounder burger as a better value because they didn't realize that a quarter pound is less than a third of a pound.
[01:31:34.782 --> 01:31:37.343]  So we're dealing with people that don't have a full deck of cards.
[01:31:37.363 --> 01:31:38.884]  They can't do a simple fraction.
[01:31:39.104 --> 01:31:41.045]  So that's the majority of people that we're dealing with.
[01:31:41.285 --> 01:31:45.727]  And that's why the only way to get through to these, lack of a better word, imbeciles, is with humor.
[01:31:46.047 --> 01:31:47.728]  Because they're using trauma-based mind control.
[01:31:47.748 --> 01:31:48.649]  So it's either or.
[01:31:48.929 --> 01:31:50.689]  Anything in the middle gets ignored.
[01:31:52.150 --> 01:31:54.431]  I agree with what we're dealing with here.
[01:31:55.111 --> 01:31:59.435]   And I think, again, to me it just exposes how See, here's what it is.
[01:31:59.495 --> 01:32:02.076]  You're actually a smart guy, okay?
[01:32:02.096 --> 01:32:04.376]  You've probably never been diagnosed with a mental disorder.
[01:32:04.396 --> 01:32:06.817]  You're a smart guy, probably a high IQ, well-studied.
[01:32:07.357 --> 01:32:17.199]  But, see, the liberal leftist that pretends to be a man or pretends to be a woman or whatever that they do, we have already subconsciously accepted that they have a mental disorder.
[01:32:17.599 --> 01:32:19.820]  It's like you don't hit Arnie from Gilbert Grape.
[01:32:20.040 --> 01:32:28.825]  So we let them behave like clowns, we let them do all the craziness because we recognize that they have a mental disorder, but when you do it, oh, that's not allowed!
[01:32:29.346 --> 01:32:39.672]  You're not allowed to do it because you're actually somebody that has a high IQ and is actually smart and we can recognize that and we can vibe with that frequency, so you're not allowed to be Alexandria.
[01:32:40.953 --> 01:32:47.257]  Only somebody that's a progressive liberal mental disorder is allowed to be Alexandria and then Alex the next day.
[01:32:47.317 --> 01:32:47.917]  Not you!
[01:32:48.017 --> 01:32:48.638]  Don't you know that?
[01:32:49.551 --> 01:32:52.172]  Alex Stein is with us from his conspiracy castle.
[01:32:53.152 --> 01:32:55.993]  That's where you can find him on YouTube, Conspiracy Castle.
[01:32:56.013 --> 01:32:58.894]  A lot of good content there.
[01:32:58.995 --> 01:33:05.617]  And I want to know if Alex agrees with my analysis of the last segment.
[01:33:05.677 --> 01:33:09.078]  He's now brought his cat into the camera here.
[01:33:09.098 --> 01:33:10.219]  I'm not sure.
[01:33:10.239 --> 01:33:10.679]  Conspiracy.
[01:33:11.239 --> 01:33:12.099]  Let me tell you something, Owen.
[01:33:12.119 --> 01:33:14.620]  I have toxoplasmosis from dealing with a fecal matter.
[01:33:14.680 --> 01:33:16.321]  It's a parasite that goes into the brain.
[01:33:17.188 --> 01:33:18.629]  And it turns you into a cat.
[01:33:18.669 --> 01:33:20.451]  So here at the castle, we have plenty of cats.
[01:33:20.491 --> 01:33:23.573]  So, you know, this is... I don't get to come on Infowars all the time, so Kyle, say hi.
[01:33:23.854 --> 01:33:24.854]  Okay, back to where we were saying.
[01:33:24.875 --> 01:33:25.895]  Sorry, the cat was interrupting.
[01:33:25.935 --> 01:33:26.696]  I apologize, Owen.
[01:33:27.477 --> 01:33:28.137]  Well, that's okay.
[01:33:28.157 --> 01:33:29.238]  We got to be open-minded.
[01:33:29.418 --> 01:33:30.559]  Animals have opinions, too.
[01:33:30.599 --> 01:33:32.100]  You know, climate change affects them, too.
[01:33:32.120 --> 01:33:33.682]  They probably need the COVID vaccine.
[01:33:34.262 --> 01:33:36.964]  But how do you... Owen, let's talk about that.
[01:33:37.025 --> 01:33:37.625]  Climate change.
[01:33:37.665 --> 01:33:38.546]  That's the new thing.
[01:33:38.586 --> 01:33:39.346]  This is the problem.
[01:33:39.406 --> 01:33:39.667]  Okay.
[01:33:39.707 --> 01:33:40.047]  No, wait.
[01:33:40.087 --> 01:33:41.108]  No, you hold it right there.
[01:33:41.128 --> 01:33:42.329]  I want you to respond.
[01:33:42.549 --> 01:33:57.122]  I want you to respond to my question, because why is it that you can't go speak as Alexandria at a city council, you get arrested and kicked out of the city council, why isn't that allowed?
[01:33:57.142 --> 01:34:00.805]  Why isn't that a hate crime against the LGBTQIA plus community?
[01:34:01.225 --> 01:34:03.007]  Where is the transgender community?
[01:34:03.047 --> 01:34:05.870]  Where is the gender fluid, gender conformity community?
[01:34:05.910 --> 01:34:07.091]  Why aren't they coming to your defense?
[01:34:07.111 --> 01:34:08.412]  Seriously, why do you think that is?
[01:34:09.639 --> 01:34:14.822]  Because the rules don't apply to me because I don't follow the New World Order's agenda.
[01:34:14.842 --> 01:34:16.403]  And that's the thing, is they're all about agendas.
[01:34:16.463 --> 01:34:18.124]  It's like AOC was casted.
[01:34:18.524 --> 01:34:23.847]  You know, these people are literally, the people that they stand up for have to go through a casting process similar to a reality TV show.
[01:34:24.168 --> 01:34:30.451]  So any elected official is bought and sold, and now I got all this cat hair on me, is bought and sold like toilet paper by these political action committees.
[01:34:30.471 --> 01:34:33.173]  So no committee will stand up for me and my trans rights.
[01:34:33.493 --> 01:34:42.715]  Because I don't have the same viewpoints as a normal trans person would, because I don't want to further the trans agenda, because my trans was an accident and it wasn't by choice.
[01:34:42.755 --> 01:34:45.916]  So that's why I think I'm a little different than a liking in the trans community as much, Owen.
[01:34:46.216 --> 01:34:47.297]  That's exactly it.
[01:34:47.397 --> 01:34:51.398]  So it's really not even about the trans community or transgendered individuals.
[01:34:51.558 --> 01:34:53.678]  It's always about the political agenda.
[01:34:53.998 --> 01:35:00.020]  It always will be, it always has been, and so that is why you aren't allowed to speak as Alexandria.
[01:35:00.600 --> 01:35:11.088]  But if you were a good leftist progressive New World Order agent, then you would be, you'd be allowed to speak, and if they kicked you out, it'd be a national crime and a hate crime, and there'd be police investigating the entire thing.
[01:35:11.128 --> 01:35:15.552]  But because you're Alex Stein, you're not allowed to have the rights of the trans community.
[01:35:15.572 --> 01:35:16.753]  You're not allowed to have those rights.
[01:35:18.266 --> 01:35:21.328]  And we know that hypocrisy is real, but that's just what we live in.
[01:35:21.368 --> 01:35:25.610]  I mean, we live in a world of complete hypocrites.
[01:35:25.651 --> 01:35:29.153]  So, you know, this is not surprising, but this is good.
[01:35:29.193 --> 01:35:32.275]  This is going to motivate me to troll them so much harder, Owen.
[01:35:32.335 --> 01:35:35.276]  I'm going to go at them so much harder, Mayor Johnson and them.
[01:35:35.556 --> 01:35:40.600]  I'm going to, I mean, literally, I'm going to bullhorn him, you know, in Alex Jones style.
[01:35:40.820 --> 01:35:44.282]  You know, he's doing the BMW marathon is coming up soon.
[01:35:44.302 --> 01:35:45.042]  He's going to speak at that.
[01:35:45.082 --> 01:35:46.083]  So I'm going to go with the bullhorn.
[01:35:46.443 --> 01:35:48.025]  And totally just annihilate him.
[01:35:48.065 --> 01:35:49.347]  So, I'm actually happy.
[01:35:49.387 --> 01:35:50.629]  What it does is it just motivates me.
[01:35:50.669 --> 01:35:55.115]  It's like you when you got in trouble for dropping the Trump 1 banner at the Ranger Stadium.
[01:35:55.356 --> 01:35:55.876]  You know what I mean?
[01:35:55.896 --> 01:35:59.622]  It sucks getting these police involved, but it kind of motivates you to do it some more.
[01:35:59.702 --> 01:36:14.737]   I hate to be, this is why I hate to be an agent of chaos, but Sadly, you kind of have to be a little bit, because if you don't stir things up, people are just going to go with the status quo, they're going to continue to be political correct, and we're just going to be on a slow-moving train to hell.
[01:36:14.777 --> 01:36:16.999]  And I think that's currently the direction that we're heading.
[01:36:17.199 --> 01:36:18.020]  Well, it's like a fight.
[01:36:18.300 --> 01:36:20.121]  You know, it's like any fighter that gets in a fight.
[01:36:20.201 --> 01:36:21.663]  You get punched, you want to punch back.
[01:36:21.923 --> 01:36:24.205]  And so that's what's going on, I think, with your situation.
[01:36:24.245 --> 01:36:30.731]  But I think it's funny, because apparently, and we'll move on to the climate after this, but I might as well bring this up right now.
[01:36:31.704 --> 01:36:33.990]  So there's a transgender police officer in the UK...
[01:36:37.099 --> 01:36:44.541]  There is now a counter-terrorism probe that has been launched after the trans police officer gets 2 million hate comments online.
[01:36:44.921 --> 01:36:51.623]  So they've launched a counter-terrorism probe because a transgender police officer was being made fun of.
[01:36:52.023 --> 01:36:53.863]  But again, where's the probe?
[01:36:54.143 --> 01:37:01.225]  Where's the investigation into Alexandria Stein having her rights denied to speak in front of City Council?
[01:37:01.325 --> 01:37:04.706]  I see the two-tiered justice system continuing and now you're a victim.
[01:37:05.882 --> 01:37:09.785]  Well, you know, the thing is, most of the times when there are, you know, hate like that, they're all hate.
[01:37:10.326 --> 01:37:11.066]  Look at that.
[01:37:11.106 --> 01:37:13.468]  I would actually, I wouldn't mind if she... Hi!
[01:37:13.768 --> 01:37:16.030]  I'm Officer Mrs. Robinson!
[01:37:16.050 --> 01:37:18.272]  And you know... BANDOVA!
[01:37:19.011 --> 01:37:19.932]  Well, I don't want to mislabel her.
[01:37:19.952 --> 01:37:25.755]  You know she did that so she can be, you know, the champion of the women's intramural police team.
[01:37:25.795 --> 01:37:28.256]  I mean, she's probably some sort of awesome basketball player.
[01:37:28.296 --> 01:37:29.337]  You know what I mean?
[01:37:29.357 --> 01:37:31.198]  Yeah, I'm gonna get a phone call now.
[01:37:31.678 --> 01:37:32.719]  I'm gonna get a phone call now.
[01:37:32.779 --> 01:37:35.060]  I'm now a part of the probe because I put that image on screen.
[01:37:35.420 --> 01:37:36.001]  You're right, though.
[01:37:36.201 --> 01:37:41.264]  She's now on the women's police force softball team, smashing dingers left and right.
[01:37:41.994 --> 01:37:46.516]  Just MVP, just, you know, the belle of the ball, literally, you know, wearing a dress after.
[01:37:46.796 --> 01:37:56.201]  But, you know, if you look at this whole, you know, the transgender agenda, and this is the one thing, I believe this sounds terrible, but it is based in a satanic origin of Baphomet.
[01:37:56.221 --> 01:37:59.742]  When you see Baphomet, it has the breasts and then it has, like, the male abs.
[01:38:00.043 --> 01:38:19.132]   So, we like to, you know, joke about this, but if you actually ask a gay person, you know, I have gay family members, so, They say the amount of people that are actually transitioning, that are either doing the gender reassignment or doing the puberty blockers, from 1990 to now, in the past 30 years, is 10,000% of what it was in the years before.
[01:38:19.192 --> 01:38:21.853]  So, what people don't realize is this is all social engineering.
[01:38:21.953 --> 01:38:24.054]  The acceptance, oh, you should be free, you should be yourself.
[01:38:24.375 --> 01:38:25.475]  Yes, you should be yourself.
[01:38:25.755 --> 01:38:27.596]  And yes, you should be eccentric.
[01:38:27.716 --> 01:38:28.337]  I'm eccentric.
[01:38:28.597 --> 01:38:34.440]  But the idea of putting an 11-year-old on puberty blockers, and then at 17, when they change their mind, they still have the genitals of an 11-year-old.
[01:38:35.180 --> 01:38:36.260]  So these people are sick.
[01:38:36.300 --> 01:38:37.481]  These parents want clout.
[01:38:37.521 --> 01:38:49.543]  We live in a world of social media where you can have a trans baby and get 10,000 likes on TikTok and there are people sick enough to do it because those are the same people that do the Munchausen by proxy or the same people that do, you know, what is it?
[01:38:49.603 --> 01:38:49.923]  I forget.
[01:38:49.964 --> 01:38:52.084]  What is the syndrome where you make your kids sick?
[01:38:52.304 --> 01:38:55.205]  But that's literally what they do when you, you know, make your kid trans.
[01:38:55.425 --> 01:38:57.445]  You're literally making your kid sick.
[01:38:57.545 --> 01:39:03.408]   And that is what these people are doing because it has origins In paganism, Satanism.
[01:39:03.469 --> 01:39:05.230]  And you're right, they do get clout from it.
[01:39:05.250 --> 01:39:06.251]  That's absolutely correct.
[01:39:06.511 --> 01:39:07.112]  So let me do this.
[01:39:07.232 --> 01:39:10.134]  I want to roll this ad and I want to get your response to this ad.
[01:39:10.154 --> 01:39:11.776]  We'll talk climate when we come back on the other side.
[01:39:12.176 --> 01:39:13.117]  But I'm going to roll this ad.
[01:39:13.157 --> 01:39:16.640]  I'm not going to tell you what this is an ad for, but I want you to watch this, Alex.
[01:39:16.660 --> 01:39:17.701]  I want the audience to watch this.
[01:39:17.741 --> 01:39:19.362]  I want you to watch this ad as you're seeing it.
[01:39:19.423 --> 01:39:21.705]  Think, what is this an advertisement from?
[01:39:21.925 --> 01:39:23.406]  Or what is this an advertisement for?
[01:39:23.426 --> 01:39:25.808]  And it may surprise you when you find out.
[01:39:25.848 --> 01:39:27.510]  So here is a new advertisement.
[01:39:28.284 --> 01:39:31.284]   See if you can figure out what it's for as we play it, clip 10.
[01:39:31.284 --> 01:39:41.284]  [MUSIC]
[01:39:41.284 --> 01:39:51.284]  [MUSIC]
[01:39:51.284 --> 01:40:01.284]  [MUSIC]
[01:40:01.284 --> 01:40:11.284]  [MUSIC]
[01:40:11.284 --> 01:40:21.284]  [MUSIC]
[01:40:21.284 --> 01:40:32.883]  Your response.
[01:40:32.883 --> 01:40:42.884]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:40:33.924 --> 01:40:53.769]  Let me tell you something, that is the most well-made transgender, basically, sorry, I don't know how I got a donation, I'm not even live right now, I don't know how that came through, but my response to that is that's the most well-made transgender porn that I've ever seen without being nude, and the reason they couldn't figure it out- Wrong!
[01:40:53.789 --> 01:40:55.390]  That is a home insurance ad!
[01:40:56.283 --> 01:40:57.684]  Oh, that's not an ad for pornography.
[01:40:57.724 --> 01:41:06.632]  Oh, I thought that was... No, that's literally a home insurance ad with a, with a, what appears to be a cross-dressing, I guess, future transgender male pretending to be a girl.
[01:41:06.672 --> 01:41:08.013]  That's an insurance ad.
[01:41:08.837 --> 01:41:10.158]  Well, this is the problem with that.
[01:41:10.198 --> 01:41:12.839]  If they could have done that with just a normal girl, it would have been a great commercial.
[01:41:12.879 --> 01:41:15.720]  They could have done a young girl, it would have been, you know, the same thing.
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:20.222]  It's that these artists, they think it's so funny and so cute to mock this, this little kid.
[01:41:20.523 --> 01:41:23.504]  And this little boy, he might not even, you know, he's probably so happy.
[01:41:23.524 --> 01:41:25.025]  Hey, let life happen, don't you know?
[01:41:25.065 --> 01:41:26.725]  Boys just, all boys want to be girls.
[01:41:26.765 --> 01:41:33.869]  Just let life happen, Alex G. Back here with Alex Stein from the Conspiracy Castle, built by Cat Hair.
[01:41:35.503 --> 01:41:40.248]  100% 100% 100% organic cat hair though, unvaccinated.
[01:41:40.268 --> 01:41:42.530]  Yeah, these cats aren't going to vaccinate.
[01:41:42.550 --> 01:41:47.475]  I know I'm vaccinated, but I want to talk about this or the serious thing because this is what's going on in the world with the infrastructure bill.
[01:41:47.836 --> 01:41:49.778]  This is just the green new deal.
[01:41:49.898 --> 01:41:53.401]  So what's happening with this whole entire COVID-19 scam?
[01:41:53.421 --> 01:41:54.002]  This is the whole thing.
[01:41:54.342 --> 01:41:55.103]  This has been a scam.
[01:41:55.123 --> 01:41:56.084]  They've been trying to do this with this.
[01:41:55.884 --> 01:41:57.802]  with the swine flu, with Ebola.
[01:41:57.802 --> 01:41:59.684]  They love to use a viral disease.
[01:41:59.684 --> 01:42:02.444]   This is just the first year they had to do it for the election because they had to
[01:42:02.444 --> 01:42:03.163]  get Trump out of there.
[01:42:03.163 --> 01:42:04.604]  They had to create a viral disease.
[01:42:04.604 --> 01:42:06.524]  And then what happened was people loved it.
[01:42:06.524 --> 01:42:07.684]  People love wearing the mask.
[01:42:07.684 --> 01:42:09.363]  I don't think they expected how much people would like it.
[01:42:09.363 --> 01:42:12.603]   I think they actually expected more people to fight back, especially in America.
[01:42:12.603 --> 01:42:15.203]  You see all over Europe, they're having these big parades.
[01:42:15.203 --> 01:42:17.403]   I mean, these big protests, people are actually fighting for it.
[01:42:17.403 --> 01:42:19.762]  Here in America, people love the mask.
[01:42:19.769 --> 01:42:23.732]  You know, it gives all these people, this grocery store, you know, bag checkers, it gives them authority.
[01:42:23.752 --> 01:42:25.613]  Oh, it's the easiest virtue signal ever.
[01:42:25.653 --> 01:42:26.614]  That's why they love it.
[01:42:26.694 --> 01:42:29.275]  It's the most effortless virtue signal they could ever have.
[01:42:29.295 --> 01:42:31.937]  And that's the problem, they're addicted to it.
[01:42:31.997 --> 01:42:36.580]  And then, oh, oh, but then they could even put like a gay flag on the mask too.
[01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:39.282]  Now they're double virtue signaling and it's just, oh.
[01:42:40.393 --> 01:42:47.398]  Well, and everybody has low self-esteem, so they put on the mask, they can hide themselves, but the problem is most of our interpersonal communication is non-verbal.
[01:42:47.438 --> 01:42:52.902]  We're smiling, we're looking at people, so now everybody's just hiding, we're getting disconnected, and then you mix that with the internet.
[01:42:53.142 --> 01:42:55.664]  But this is the thing, is SARS is real.
[01:42:55.704 --> 01:43:00.047]  Like, I'm not saying COVID is what they say it is, but before COVID, people have died of SARS.
[01:43:00.067 --> 01:43:01.508]  There's Middle Eastern Respiratory Virus.
[01:43:01.528 --> 01:43:02.869]  We had heard about SARS and MERS.
[01:43:03.209 --> 01:43:05.051]  There are such things as respiratory illnesses.
[01:43:05.351 --> 01:43:09.575]  But the reason is, the problem is the average age of a coronavirus death is 81 years old.
[01:43:09.635 --> 01:43:12.317]  The average age in the United States is 78 years old.
[01:43:12.597 --> 01:43:16.360]  So you actually live three years longer if you were to die of COVID-19.
[01:43:16.581 --> 01:43:21.425]  And people are too stupid to realize that because they like the mask, they like the restrictions, they like doing work.
[01:43:21.465 --> 01:43:23.907]  No, that's like Sanjay Gupta on Joe Rogan.
[01:43:24.147 --> 01:43:33.613]  And maybe Gupta's just pretending to be ignorant of all this stuff, but this is a health expert, a doctor that goes on CNN, and Rogan is schooling him on all this stuff.
[01:43:33.853 --> 01:43:37.575]  So Gupta's either pretending to be ignorant, or he is truly ignorant.
[01:43:39.093 --> 01:43:42.574]  Well, I don't know if he's that good of an actor, because he sounded like such an idiot on there.
[01:43:42.634 --> 01:43:44.555]  And, you know, he's going to say as little as possible.
[01:43:44.755 --> 01:43:46.075]  But the worst is Leanna Wynne.
[01:43:46.115 --> 01:43:47.295]  He's always with Leanna Wynne.
[01:43:47.335 --> 01:43:50.196]  She's the biggest New World Order advocate in the world.
[01:43:50.216 --> 01:43:56.858]  She was just with the Bos... You saw her talking at the Boston bombing and worried about how her husband might have been at the finish line where the bomb exploded.
[01:43:57.078 --> 01:43:58.759]  And this is at the Boston bombing years ago.
[01:43:58.819 --> 01:44:00.079]  So she's been on their radar.
[01:44:00.119 --> 01:44:02.520]  She's been working with, you know, the Clinton Initiative group.
[01:44:02.540 --> 01:44:05.601]  She's always been a part of like... Used to be the president of Planned Parenthood.
[01:44:06.540 --> 01:44:08.661]  100%.
[01:44:06.600 --> 01:44:08.661]  And guess why she got kicked out of Planned Parenthood?
[01:44:08.901 --> 01:44:12.083]  Because she had an ideological difference that she had a miscarriage.
[01:44:12.103 --> 01:44:16.364]  And at Planned Parenthood, in their verbiage, you cannot say miscarriage because it's not a life.
[01:44:16.484 --> 01:44:18.365]  Any baby that gets aborted is never a life.
[01:44:18.665 --> 01:44:22.807]  Yes, and so that's why she actually, in her book, Lifelines, Leanna Winn, got fired.
[01:44:22.827 --> 01:44:26.069]  She got let go from Planned Parenthood because she kept on talking about her miscarriage.
[01:44:26.249 --> 01:44:30.830]   And you cannot say in Planned Parenthood, in their verbiage, There's no such thing as a miscarriage.
[01:44:30.870 --> 01:44:31.831]  It's just a non-birth.
[01:44:32.151 --> 01:44:34.791]  And so that's why, ideologically, she got fired from there.
[01:44:35.051 --> 01:44:38.632]  And she's an evil person, but at the same time, a lot of these people are puppets.
[01:44:38.672 --> 01:44:47.474]  It's like when I say the world's run by multinational corporations, if you become the CEO of Nabisco Cookies, you don't give a crap that Oreo gives everybody diarrhea, I mean, diabetes.
[01:44:47.514 --> 01:44:52.615]  You don't care that, you know, Coca-Cola, they don't care that their product kills people because, you know, they don't have a soul.
[01:44:52.655 --> 01:44:54.815]  They just want to do whatever they can to keep their job.
[01:44:54.855 --> 01:44:57.556]  Like all these politicians, it's all about, you know, self-preservation.
[01:44:57.876 --> 01:44:59.777]  And Leanna Wynn and Sanjay Gupta are the same.
[01:44:59.817 --> 01:45:02.038]  They're just going to repeat the same thing.
[01:45:02.058 --> 01:45:05.239]  They're going to say whatever the opposite of the conspiracy theorist is.
[01:45:05.279 --> 01:45:11.942]  And we know the term conspiracy theorist was created by the CIA during the JFK assassination to demonize people that are looking into the official story.
[01:45:11.962 --> 01:45:14.644]  So that's the problem is these people are their bell cows.
[01:45:14.664 --> 01:45:25.909]  They're the people that they know are not going to go out of bounds because they're so programmed and they're so indoctrinated in their colleges and their eight years of medical school that these people are never going to go out of bounds and say anything incorrect.
[01:45:27.614 --> 01:45:30.415]  And I think it's just very revealing for people to see that.
[01:45:31.596 --> 01:45:33.736]  And they have to reach either one of the two conclusions.
[01:45:33.816 --> 01:45:40.579]  Either Gupta is ignorant on all of this, or he's just pretending to be ignorant on all this to fool the audience.
[01:45:41.139 --> 01:45:43.080]  Either way, it doesn't really go well for him.
[01:45:44.096 --> 01:45:46.658]  I know you also wanted... Oh, and tell me this.
[01:45:46.858 --> 01:45:51.602]  How does a guy like Brian Stelter become the lead, basically the lead analyst on CNN?
[01:45:51.642 --> 01:45:54.044]  I mean, the guy is not attractive, has a terrible voice.
[01:45:54.304 --> 01:45:55.565]  You know, I mean, and Jim Acosta.
[01:45:55.785 --> 01:45:57.847]  The people these... What's wrong with my voice?
[01:45:57.867 --> 01:46:00.909]  I'm just saying they're the worst broadcasters.
[01:46:00.929 --> 01:46:02.130]  They're not even watchable.
[01:46:02.390 --> 01:46:04.232]  So it's just the fact that they put these people up.
[01:46:04.652 --> 01:46:05.773]  It's disgusting.
[01:46:05.793 --> 01:46:07.574]  How dare you say that I have a funny voice?
[01:46:07.895 --> 01:46:09.296]  My voice is perfectly normal.
[01:46:10.783 --> 01:46:12.645]  It's the lowest form of entertainment.
[01:46:12.765 --> 01:46:17.970]  I'm 33 years old and I look like I'm 50 and I sound like Elmo.
[01:46:18.430 --> 01:46:19.551]  There's nothing wrong with that.
[01:46:21.213 --> 01:46:33.764]  I mean and the fact that he's become so successful is just so sad and he's the, you know, he is the biggest champion for the new world order on CNN and it's just so sad and that's the problem with all media now.
[01:46:33.804 --> 01:46:35.086]  It's all about intersectionality.
[01:46:35.106 --> 01:46:38.828]   If you don't check a box, You're not going to be able to be put on screen.
[01:46:38.868 --> 01:46:42.911]  It's like, look at that Kamala Harris nightmare video where she has that space video with the little kids.
[01:46:43.171 --> 01:46:44.311]  There's no white boy.
[01:46:44.652 --> 01:46:57.379]  It's all, you know, it's all like an Asian Pacific kid, a black girl, you know, a Chinese kid, because, you know, they can't show a representation unless it is of a, uh, you know, and that video, that video was so odd.
[01:46:57.819 --> 01:47:01.562]  Because I remember I watched the video and I didn't know what was going on at the time.
[01:47:01.602 --> 01:47:03.783]  I thought it was just a normal Kamala Harris antics.
[01:47:03.983 --> 01:47:04.924]  She's such a phony.
[01:47:04.944 --> 01:47:07.886]  It was just a normal Kamala Harris phonyism.
[01:47:08.006 --> 01:47:10.347]  And then it turns out, nope, these are all paid actors.
[01:47:11.268 --> 01:47:13.570]  YouTube is claiming that they're the ones that hired them.
[01:47:13.630 --> 01:47:17.512]  That may be a cover because the same actors were in Michelle Obama videos as well.
[01:47:17.552 --> 01:47:20.714]  So I think it's a Democrat pool of actors that they pull them from.
[01:47:21.015 --> 01:47:25.377]  But it's like how many of them, like you said earlier, how many of these politicians are actors?
[01:47:25.878 --> 01:47:27.699]  How many people in our government are literally actors?
[01:47:28.379 --> 01:47:29.020]  Let me say this.
[01:47:29.180 --> 01:47:33.422]  Listen, Kamala Harris is my favorite person in the world because she used to get raw dogged by Montel Williams.
[01:47:33.462 --> 01:47:34.243]  So let me tell you something.
[01:47:34.463 --> 01:47:35.364]  This is what's going to happen.
[01:47:35.424 --> 01:47:41.067]  Joe Biden is going to step down and then we're going to get my girl Kamala Harris and it's going to be exactly like a Tyler Perry movie.
[01:47:41.087 --> 01:47:42.748]  It's going to be like Madea goes to the White House.
[01:47:43.028 --> 01:47:50.172]  And at that point, I think at that point it actually might wake up somebody because it will be because Joe Biden as inept and how dumb he is.
[01:47:50.492 --> 01:47:54.595]  I think Kamala Harris is worse actually because she's even a bigger agent for the New World Order.
[01:47:54.855 --> 01:47:58.180]  So I'm not saying it's a good thing, but how Trump is saying, like, don't vote.
[01:47:58.461 --> 01:48:00.985]  It's because you got to let these people shoot themselves in the foot.
[01:48:01.025 --> 01:48:03.008]  You almost have to let them self-sabotage it.
[01:48:03.349 --> 01:48:07.515]  Give them the football so they can fumble it because they're not qualified to run the football.
[01:48:07.535 --> 01:48:08.096]  Do you know what I mean?
[01:48:09.164 --> 01:48:16.594]  Yeah, and I guess it's just a measurement of how bad do we want it to get or how bad are we going to let them make things.
[01:48:16.855 --> 01:48:18.917]  And we're starting to really get a taste of it, I think.
[01:48:19.638 --> 01:48:25.186]  But, you know, that's part of the real world learning experience that you're talking about because it's almost like this weird thing where...
[01:48:26.187 --> 01:48:30.831]  It's like, I can show people data on masks, or I can show people data on vaccines, or I can show people all the data in the world.
[01:48:31.151 --> 01:48:40.459]  It's not going to change their mind, but then, oh, they get a vaccine that causes them to have a stroke, or Guillain-Barré, or their aunt to die, then they learn from the real world experience.
[01:48:40.479 --> 01:48:43.722]  It doesn't matter I already told them that would be the case, they had to learn it for themselves.
[01:48:44.944 --> 01:48:50.189]  Oh, and they say that it causes myocarditis in young people, and it especially affects young people.
[01:48:50.490 --> 01:49:03.643]  And Gavin Newsom is mandating it for 5 to 11 year olds, and I know we're just beating a horse to death, because you and I both know this, and no amount of evidence will convince an idiot, but these people are sacrificing their kids, like people used to sacrifice their children to Moloch.
[01:49:03.703 --> 01:49:05.063]  and they don't even realize it.
[01:49:05.063 --> 01:49:08.103]   And you're right, the only way they're gonna realize the stove is hot until they touch it
[01:49:08.103 --> 01:49:09.422]  and they burn their hands, sadly.
[01:49:09.422 --> 01:49:12.382]   And that's why the VAERS report, they can see the VAERS report,
[01:49:12.382 --> 01:49:16.462]   and even though a lot of stuff doesn't get reported, all this information's out there, and they've seen it,
[01:49:16.462 --> 01:49:18.382]  but they've all chosen not to believe it.
[01:49:18.382 --> 01:49:20.182]  That's where we're at in this pandemic.
[01:49:20.182 --> 01:49:23.603]   People have all seen both sides, and they're just choosing to stay on the side
[01:49:23.603 --> 01:49:26.343]   where they don't have to think, where people will choose for them,
[01:49:26.343 --> 01:49:29.523]  'cause everybody is basically a moron, sadly.
[01:49:29.523 --> 01:49:36.142]   Yeah, ignorance is bliss for only so long, and going along with all this stuff,
[01:49:36.142 --> 01:49:40.843]   what you think it may be for your own political benefit, you're gonna learn the hard way that it's not.
[01:49:40.688 --> 01:49:47.409]  Whether it's you going to the store and there's no food on the shelves, whether it's you getting home from work and you can't turn the heat on.
[01:49:47.829 --> 01:49:50.290]  They're going to experience all of it, which is just sad.
[01:49:50.330 --> 01:49:52.591]  I don't want it to be that way because I'm going to have to live through it with them.
[01:49:53.191 --> 01:50:01.673]  But I guess if that's what it takes for them to wake up and we can take the world back from these heartless, soulless, world government corporations, then I guess that's what it's going to take.
[01:50:02.537 --> 01:50:06.260]  Well, this is how it works, Owen, is they lay the trap out and we decide whether to fall in it.
[01:50:06.560 --> 01:50:18.829]  And even though things are going to get, and we're going to see man-made horrors beyond our belief, but as long as we don't fall for the traps, as long as we choose not to fall for the, you know, play their reindeer games, we can actually stay unharmed.
[01:50:19.089 --> 01:50:20.850]  I firmly believe that because these people aren't good.
[01:50:20.870 --> 01:50:21.911]  We're dealing with George Bush.
[01:50:22.111 --> 01:50:23.052]  This isn't Prescott Bush.
[01:50:23.072 --> 01:50:24.613]  This is the autistic grandchildren.
[01:50:24.552 --> 01:50:26.153]  of these new world order leaders.
[01:50:26.153 --> 01:50:29.752]   So like I said, these people are going to butt fumble the ball like Mark Sanchez or
[01:50:29.752 --> 01:50:34.731]   like any other imbecile that just inherited the world and that aren't actually ready to
[01:50:34.731 --> 01:50:35.731]  control it.
[01:50:35.731 --> 01:50:37.512]   And you look at Hillary Clinton, she's going to be gone soon.
[01:50:37.512 --> 01:50:39.592]  Then we got Barack and Michelle Obama.
[01:50:39.592 --> 01:50:42.112]  These people are going to mess up, Owen, I promise you.
[01:50:42.112 --> 01:50:43.952]  Hillary won't go away.
[01:50:43.952 --> 01:50:45.431]  I got news on Hillary today.
[01:50:45.493 --> 01:50:48.715]  Hillary, she refuses to go away this wench.
[01:50:48.735 --> 01:50:51.155]  Alright, but let's get into this because you said something there.
[01:50:51.175 --> 01:50:52.176]  We got to go to break here, Alex.
[01:50:52.876 --> 01:50:53.496]  You said something.
[01:50:53.516 --> 01:50:55.917]  I want to get you to go further into this.
[01:50:56.377 --> 01:51:00.918]  We're going to see hellacious man-made horrors in the near future.
[01:51:00.938 --> 01:51:01.499]  I agree.
[01:51:01.519 --> 01:51:02.539]  I want to hear your opinion on that.
[01:51:02.879 --> 01:51:04.620]  Folks, COVID was man-made.
[01:51:04.760 --> 01:51:05.960]  The pandemic was man-made.
[01:51:06.080 --> 01:51:07.020]  Imagine what they have next.
[01:51:08.221 --> 01:51:10.642]  I'm asking the crew if that's an actual Tesla quote.
[01:51:10.922 --> 01:51:17.381]   I thought they were Pulling a quick one because that's what Alex said in the last segment, but this is apparently a real quote from Tesla.
[01:51:17.861 --> 01:51:21.163]  You may live to see man-made horrors beyond your comprehension.
[01:51:21.604 --> 01:51:29.670]  Well, yeah, we've already seen COVID made in a lab, which somehow that detail gets left out of all the government approaches towards the COVID tyranny and the policies.
[01:51:30.050 --> 01:51:33.413]  By the way, again, I just say this as an aside because it's just wild.
[01:51:34.614 --> 01:51:39.938]  Declassified FBI documents claim that Nikola Tesla was in communication with space people.
[01:51:41.071 --> 01:51:46.954]  So, I don't know what is meant by that, but just a little something for you to chew on if you want to go down that route.
[01:51:47.754 --> 01:51:49.275]  But so, you know, Alex, I'll just say this.
[01:51:49.715 --> 01:51:54.838]  I had been telling people about man-made weather phenomenons for years, and they would call me crazy.
[01:51:54.858 --> 01:51:55.918]  I'd say, look up in the sky.
[01:51:55.958 --> 01:51:58.700]  I mean, what are you, don't believe your own lying eyes?
[01:51:58.740 --> 01:52:00.220]  These lines in the sky aren't natural.
[01:52:00.741 --> 01:52:03.442]  And then I went, they had a public hearing in Texas.
[01:52:05.376 --> 01:52:15.061]  That the people that do the man-made weather phenomenons, and I forget, you know, they have cloud seeding, and they have different terms for it, and they say it's to control rain or help crops.
[01:52:15.241 --> 01:52:18.062]  And I went to the whole meeting, I live-streamed it, it was about three hours long.
[01:52:18.623 --> 01:52:24.906]  I even got to talk to the scientists and the people that do it, and I said, you know, people tell me this doesn't exist, what would you have to say?
[01:52:24.926 --> 01:52:26.807]  They say, yeah, it absolutely exists, what do you mean?
[01:52:26.847 --> 01:52:28.268]  Here's the official documents.
[01:52:28.948 --> 01:52:29.789]  So it's the weirdest thing.
[01:52:29.809 --> 01:52:36.814]  It's like, I know this is going on, I can prove that it's going on, and people still don't want to admit it, just like the COVID was made in the lab.
[01:52:37.074 --> 01:52:38.455]  So what do you think we're going to see?
[01:52:38.575 --> 01:52:46.941]  What inexplicable, uncomprehendable, man-made phenomenons do you think we're going to see next to bring us into a one-world government tyranny?
[01:52:47.742 --> 01:52:48.763]  Well, it starts with this.
[01:52:48.823 --> 01:52:55.208]  After the false flag attacks on 9-11, we signed the Patriot Act, which gave them warrantless search and seizure of our phones and emails.
[01:52:55.608 --> 01:52:59.331]  So, what's going to happen next is they're going to have to do... First, there's going to happen an internet breakdown.
[01:52:59.391 --> 01:53:03.213]  When Facebook goes out for six hours, people, you have soccer moms blowing their brains out.
[01:53:03.554 --> 01:53:07.497]  So, all they have to do is turn off the internet for a few hours and all infrastructure will go out.
[01:53:07.537 --> 01:53:09.878]  You know, oh, we won't be able to get trains, nothing will work.
[01:53:09.918 --> 01:53:12.620]  So, people say, oh, we've got to have a system, the internet of things.
[01:53:12.640 --> 01:53:13.641]  So, we have constant internet.
[01:53:13.661 --> 01:53:14.382]  So, that's why the 5G.
[01:53:14.582 --> 01:53:16.043]  So, no way you can lose internet.
[01:53:16.303 --> 01:53:18.767]  And what's going to happen is that's going to give us the Patriot Act 2.0.
[01:53:18.887 --> 01:53:26.037]  And they're going to have warrantless search and seizure of your text messages, of your browser history, of every single thing you do, and you're going to sign up for it!
[01:53:26.258 --> 01:53:30.784]  You're going to be, oh I got the Patriot Act 2.0 and then I got free Krispy Kreme donuts for doing it!
[01:53:30.844 --> 01:53:31.666]  It's so good!
[01:53:32.046 --> 01:53:37.349]  And everybody's going to do it, and that is going to be a man-made horror, because what they're going to say is, oh, climate change is so bad!
[01:53:37.650 --> 01:53:45.315]  From the cloud seeding, you can pay to have your wedding not have rain, because they can use this technology to either cloud seed or de-seed a cloud, I guess they call it.
[01:53:45.575 --> 01:53:51.579]  So what they're going to do is they're going to use the climate change to lock us in our houses, and they're going to use our phones as the prison.
[01:53:51.839 --> 01:53:55.461]  So for you and I, I mean, at that moment, I don't think I'm going to follow those rules.
[01:53:55.481 --> 01:53:56.262]  I'm going to leave my house.
[01:53:57.202 --> 01:53:58.723]  It's going to be much worse than that.
[01:53:58.763 --> 01:54:02.904]  I'm just saying for you and I, that will be the worst man-made horrors that we're going to see very soon.
[01:54:03.104 --> 01:54:10.426]  The idea of this infrastructure bill was all put in so that they can put us under constant surveillance and they can tax us per mile on our car.
[01:54:10.725 --> 01:54:14.644]   So this whole COVID-19 thing was just a beta testing program.
[01:54:14.644 --> 01:54:18.524]   Because look at Australia, look at these other countries where they're even more psycho about it.
[01:54:18.524 --> 01:54:20.885]   You know, they didn't know how crazy they're going to be about it.
[01:54:20.885 --> 01:54:22.605]  They were just going to see how it works.
[01:54:22.605 --> 01:54:26.244]   So when they do the climate change lockdown, they know who's going to kick back,
[01:54:26.244 --> 01:54:28.326]  which countries are going to be the biggest pain in the ass.
[01:54:28.326 --> 01:54:30.525]  And that's, what's going to be the new issue.
[01:54:30.034 --> 01:54:34.055]  I'm telling you, Owen, that is going to be the nightmare when you can't drive in your car and they turn it off.
[01:54:34.075 --> 01:54:37.276]  That's why all the electric cars, all the digital currency, you won't be able to shop.
[01:54:37.536 --> 01:54:38.856]  You'll be on a no-fly list.
[01:54:39.076 --> 01:54:40.777]  You literally will not be able to move.
[01:54:40.797 --> 01:54:43.677]  And if you do, a tracker will go off on your phone.
[01:54:43.938 --> 01:54:45.638]  So it's literally George Orwell's 1984.
[01:54:46.698 --> 01:54:48.318]  And there's a reason they all knew about that.
[01:54:48.359 --> 01:54:49.519]  They learned about it in Tavistock.
[01:54:49.559 --> 01:54:54.880]  And everything they wrote about in those books you know how to read in school, it sadly is going to come true, where everybody's on an antidepressant.
[01:54:55.180 --> 01:55:00.082]  To try to numb the pain of living under constant technical technocracy terror.
[01:55:01.002 --> 01:55:07.784]  And the craziest part about that, we'll be watching our fellow humans not see what's going on.
[01:55:07.844 --> 01:55:20.849]  Like you said, they'll celebrate it, they'll celebrate their free donut, they'll celebrate whatever it is they're told, whatever little kitty bag that they're given, like they're part of something good, something bigger, and they won't see how they're just being totally enslaved.
[01:55:21.369 --> 01:55:27.094]   And we're just gonna sit here and watch it all in shock and horror, And it's like, hey, we tried to warn you this was happening.
[01:55:27.114 --> 01:55:27.875]  And they'd be like, what?
[01:55:27.935 --> 01:55:28.616]  This is great.
[01:55:28.656 --> 01:55:29.237]  What do you mean?
[01:55:29.297 --> 01:55:29.958]  You warned us.
[01:55:29.998 --> 01:55:31.680]  This is the most fantastic thing ever.
[01:55:31.700 --> 01:55:33.563]  It's like, how can you not see this was man-made?
[01:55:33.603 --> 01:55:38.270]  But yeah, if they can't see how COVID was man-made, then I guess they'll just believe anything.
[01:55:39.198 --> 01:55:44.540]  Well, and Owen, you look like I'm not really worried about martial law more than the division they're going to cause in a race war.
[01:55:44.721 --> 01:55:46.781]  They're just dividing us so much so.
[01:55:47.502 --> 01:55:48.742]  Listen, I love everybody.
[01:55:48.782 --> 01:55:49.683]  I'm a culture vulture.
[01:55:49.823 --> 01:55:51.123]  I love the black culture.
[01:55:51.143 --> 01:55:58.567]  But sadly, like there's videos where I'll go to like all black parties and you know, the black people are looking at me like I'm an enemy because that's all the social engineering.
[01:55:58.607 --> 01:55:59.767]  So this is the problem.
[01:55:59.787 --> 01:56:01.148]  This is the man-made horror we're going to see.
[01:56:01.408 --> 01:56:05.690]  I don't necessarily think there's going to be some civil war in the streets because I think that would get shut down pretty fast.
[01:56:05.730 --> 01:56:08.911]   But you're going to have a world where you can't even They're going to create segregation.
[01:56:08.931 --> 01:56:10.212]  Segregation is coming back.
[01:56:10.252 --> 01:56:13.073]  We already see it in non-vaccinated and vaccinated.
[01:56:13.293 --> 01:56:14.613]  So it's going to get so deep.
[01:56:14.653 --> 01:56:18.214]  We're going to actually be segregated, I believe, in almost different districts.
[01:56:18.234 --> 01:56:20.315]  Like you'll live in Texas because that is more conservative.
[01:56:20.335 --> 01:56:21.155]  You'll live in L.A.
[01:56:21.415 --> 01:56:26.296]  and it'll be so strong that you won't even be able to live in your society ideologically.
[01:56:26.636 --> 01:56:31.318]  If you don't align with the same ideas as the state you live in, you will have to move.
[01:56:31.358 --> 01:56:32.698]  That's how intense things are going to get.
[01:56:32.918 --> 01:56:35.499]  And for you and me, I think that's going to be a total man-made horror.
[01:56:36.200 --> 01:56:41.872]  And I don't think it would be very long with the internet going out where people would start killing each other in the streets, as sick as that is.
[01:56:43.103 --> 01:56:50.187]  And of course, the real thing won't be about, oh, somebody can't get on Facebook or somebody, you know, can't send a tweet out or whatever.
[01:56:50.327 --> 01:56:57.511]  Like you said, it's going to be, oh, the trains are shut down, the airplanes are shut down, the energy is shut down, everything's shut down because of the internet.
[01:56:57.871 --> 01:56:58.371]  And who knows?
[01:56:58.391 --> 01:56:59.372]  They'll blame Russia.
[01:56:59.392 --> 01:57:03.254]  I don't think they still want to do Middle East terrorists as the boogeyman anymore.
[01:57:03.294 --> 01:57:05.315]  I think that that thing has kind of gone its way.
[01:57:05.375 --> 01:57:07.756]  So they'll either blame Russia or they'll have it in operation.
[01:57:07.776 --> 01:57:08.477]  They'll blame China.
[01:57:09.690 --> 01:57:10.431]  Well, let me say this.
[01:57:10.471 --> 01:57:20.798]  People want to say systemic racism doesn't exist, but I can prove that systemic racism does exist, because they're unfairly, they used to go after the Muslim terrorists, I think it was Last Action Hero, in order to use, you know, a lot of the military stuff.
[01:57:20.818 --> 01:57:24.341]  They wanted to do, like, Chinese terrorists, and they said, no, you have to do Muslim terrorists.
[01:57:24.601 --> 01:57:26.982]  But now, they're going after white guys like you.
[01:57:27.083 --> 01:57:28.524]  You are the new domestic terrorist.
[01:57:28.544 --> 01:57:35.829]  They're systematically racist towards white people, the FBI is, because now they're done by all these woke-ism and all this intersectionality.
[01:57:36.209 --> 01:57:42.534]  That now they're actually going after people that are literally white and they're literally racist, reverse racism.
[01:57:42.574 --> 01:57:43.394]  And that's real.
[01:57:43.434 --> 01:57:45.376]  I don't know how you could tell me any difference when you think about it.
[01:57:45.396 --> 01:57:45.616]  No, no, no.
[01:57:45.636 --> 01:57:46.257]  You're absolutely right.
[01:57:46.317 --> 01:57:49.639]  And they look at it as it's like a veil of protection.
[01:57:49.759 --> 01:57:51.300]  It's like a hedge of protection against them.
[01:57:51.340 --> 01:57:53.362]  It's like, look, I'm against white people.
[01:57:53.802 --> 01:57:54.743]  I hate white people.
[01:57:54.803 --> 01:57:56.104]  See, I'm a good person.
[01:57:56.404 --> 01:57:57.205]  That's what they look at it.
[01:57:57.265 --> 01:58:02.068]  It's like they can be the worst person on earth, biggest criminal, totally corrupt government, politician, whatever, FBI.
[01:58:02.108 --> 01:58:03.990]  But oh, oh, they hate white people.
[01:58:04.010 --> 01:58:05.351]  Then they must be good.
[01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:45.319]   I know and it's I mean the demonization of white people right now is so strong you can't even watch like you know the media has always been using social engineering but now every commercial I mean every McDonald's commercials never had a white guy in it but you're just coming in a day and age where you literally turn on a car insurance commercial and it's a transgender girl I mean we're living in a the clown world you know that I know that and sadly I don't know when people are gonna break out of it because we said this already no amount of evidence Well, it's sad because they're going to go through so much torture with all of this.
[01:58:45.859 --> 01:58:50.981]  Right now, it's with the vaccines that are getting them sick and with the shutdowns that they're all involved in.
[01:58:51.021 --> 01:58:52.202]  I mean, I feel bad.
[01:58:53.122 --> 01:59:00.425]  I got stories today I'm going to cover later on The War Room of just all these people dying from the vaccine and it's just like, oh well, we're still going to mandate it.
[01:59:00.766 --> 01:59:03.807]  I mean, if they mandated a leg amputation, would you do that too?
[01:59:04.767 --> 01:59:05.828]  Oh, and how stupid are people?
[01:59:05.848 --> 01:59:11.395]  They say we're in the worst part of a pandemic, and I do believe the hospitals are full, and now they're firing healthcare workers.
[01:59:11.495 --> 01:59:16.861]  If we were in a real pandemic, do you think we could afford to fire healthcare workers?
[01:59:17.382 --> 01:59:17.762]  No!
[01:59:17.843 --> 01:59:18.864]  But people are so dumb.
[01:59:18.904 --> 01:59:21.487]  That's why all these hospitals in Houston are letting go of their whole staff.
[01:59:21.967 --> 01:59:25.571]  And I do believe we know people are getting messed up from the vaccine.
[01:59:25.611 --> 01:59:29.134]  We know young people are getting myocarditis at a rate that we've never ever seen.
[01:59:29.174 --> 01:59:32.417]  And then Pfizer comes out with the first ever blood thinner for children.
[01:59:32.697 --> 01:59:35.000]  I mean, they had this planned all along.
[01:59:35.200 --> 01:59:36.101]  Alex talked about this.
[01:59:36.181 --> 01:59:38.363]  Everybody had talked about this, the mandatory vaccines.
[01:59:38.863 --> 01:59:41.785]  And now their plan worked, so it's on to the next one.
[01:59:42.085 --> 01:59:46.087]  And this is what they love, the TikTok nurses, the dancing, these healthcare workers.
[01:59:46.107 --> 01:59:52.410]  This is the problem, Owen, is they need it to be as bad as possible because that gives them as much clout, that gives them the most respect.
[01:59:52.430 --> 01:59:54.771]  So the worse it is, the better they look.
[01:59:54.791 --> 01:59:57.072]  So they're always going to encourage the chaos.
[01:59:57.092 --> 02:00:02.915]  They're always going to make you make the selfie videos with the mask marks on their face like, oh my God, today was so bad.
[02:00:02.955 --> 02:00:04.536]  We lost an unvaccinated patient.
[02:00:06.497 --> 02:00:07.978]  And his family was crying about him.
[02:00:07.999 --> 02:00:09.540]  If he just would have been vaccinated, he'd live.
[02:00:09.820 --> 02:00:11.181]  Which is the farthest thing from the truth.
[02:00:11.201 --> 02:00:12.403]  They actually just came out with a study.
[02:00:12.483 --> 02:00:14.044]  It was on the front page of Daily Mail.
[02:00:14.484 --> 02:00:18.108]  One out of every 25,000 that have been vaccinated dies of COVID.
[02:00:18.428 --> 02:00:20.230]  And I believe it's a much higher number than that.
[02:00:20.450 --> 02:00:28.057]  So they even tell you these numbers and people still believe that vaccines are safe and effective when, listen Owen, you and I both know almonds are not safe and effective for everyone.
[02:00:28.377 --> 02:00:30.199]  Peanuts are not safe and effective for everyone.
[02:00:30.439 --> 02:00:34.002]  If you went to a baseball game and you gave some kid a peanut and he had a peanut allergy, he would die.
[02:00:34.283 --> 02:00:41.610]  So you cannot tell me a vaccine with mRNA technology made from aborted fetal cells that somebody's not allergic to that.
[02:00:41.690 --> 02:00:42.450]  So that's the problem.
[02:00:42.490 --> 02:00:49.057]  As soon as they say it's safe and effective for everyone, you know it's a lie because there's no panacea that works like that, if an almond doesn't even work like that.
[02:00:49.437 --> 02:00:53.818]  Yeah, I mean, pretty much anything I see from mainstream media I count as a lie until it can be proven true.
[02:00:54.318 --> 02:00:57.919]  Alex Stein, Conspiracy Castle, great to have you on today.
[02:00:58.699 --> 02:01:01.660]  And, you know, we should probably have you back on.
[02:01:01.700 --> 02:01:05.621]  It was a wonderful hour, and I need to look more into your content as well.
[02:01:05.941 --> 02:01:12.083]  You're a master-level troll, I think, and so we may have something in common there.
[02:01:12.921 --> 02:01:13.602]  Yes, we are.
[02:01:13.642 --> 02:01:15.383]  I would love to ever create some content.
[02:01:15.403 --> 02:01:16.183]  I'll come down to Austin.
[02:01:16.203 --> 02:01:16.664]  I'll do anything.
[02:01:16.684 --> 02:01:19.866]  And one last thing, I want to say RIP Rob Skiba.
[02:01:19.906 --> 02:01:20.706]  He was a great guy.
[02:01:20.726 --> 02:01:21.347]  Geocentrist.
[02:01:21.427 --> 02:01:23.108]  I just want to say RIP.
[02:01:23.448 --> 02:01:24.329]  We lost a good man.
[02:01:24.389 --> 02:01:25.830]  And thank you for letting me come on.
[02:01:25.870 --> 02:01:27.071]  And you are a true patriot.
[02:01:28.664 --> 02:01:33.267]  Deadly viruses are emerging, not because Peter Daszak and Falchion Gates created it in a lab.
[02:01:33.287 --> 02:01:35.008]  We don't even have the documents proving they did.
[02:01:35.369 --> 02:01:36.509]  And they said they were going to release it.
[02:01:36.850 --> 02:01:37.570]  Total smoking gun.
[02:01:37.910 --> 02:01:38.291]  Oh no!
[02:01:38.391 --> 02:01:42.013]  The news is saying it happened because you had a car or air conditioning.
[02:01:42.333 --> 02:01:43.554]  See, it's your fault you're dying.
[02:01:43.594 --> 02:01:45.195]  It's your fault there's human-animal clones.
[02:01:45.395 --> 02:01:46.856]  It's your fault there's deadly viruses.
[02:01:47.077 --> 02:01:48.618]  Five of them spliced together and released.
[02:01:49.318 --> 02:01:49.838]  All confirmed.
[02:01:50.218 --> 02:01:51.859]  It's your fault there's human-animal clones.
[02:01:52.259 --> 02:01:52.780]  The U.S.
[02:01:52.820 --> 02:01:54.800]  Senate headline, U.S.
[02:01:54.840 --> 02:01:58.982]  Senate refuses to ban certain types of animal-human hybrids.
[02:02:00.103 --> 02:02:03.324]  Senate kills GOP legislation prohibits certain human-animal hybrids.
[02:02:04.084 --> 02:02:05.225]  Chimeras, Forbes.
[02:02:05.805 --> 02:02:12.168]  Just like it's a fact that the Pfizer shot and the Moderna shot give you cancer, cause heart attacks, destroy your immune system, don't protect you.
[02:02:13.135 --> 02:02:14.555]  I'm not giving medical advice.
[02:02:14.676 --> 02:02:16.216]  I'm not telling anybody what to do.
[02:02:16.256 --> 02:02:18.197]  But informed consent is the rule.
[02:02:18.717 --> 02:02:24.939]  And you are distributing an experimental vaccine at this public school right now.
[02:02:25.379 --> 02:02:30.740]  An experimental vaccine that has ingredients in it that say not for human use.
[02:02:31.601 --> 02:02:32.881]  Pfizer asked U.S.
[02:02:32.921 --> 02:02:42.704]  to allow COVID shots for kids ages 5 to 11, even though the only children that have died less than 50 had heart attacks, cancer, three or four comorbidities and didn't die of COVID.
[02:02:43.362 --> 02:02:45.124]  Just in time for holiday travel.
[02:02:45.344 --> 02:02:51.110]  That's when nearly 30 million children between the ages of 5 and 11 could become eligible for the Pfizer vaccine.
[02:02:51.591 --> 02:02:55.935]  Today, the company officially asking the FDA for emergency use authorization.
[02:02:56.055 --> 02:02:56.576]  Does it matter?
[02:02:56.596 --> 02:02:59.279]  Europe just banned these vaccines for under 30s!
[02:03:00.620 --> 02:03:06.485]  Because they were killing so many people, but don't worry, they're gonna double down and say, oh no, pregnant women need it.
[02:03:06.786 --> 02:03:08.667]  Remember, what did I say hundreds of times here?
[02:03:08.747 --> 02:03:10.609]  I said immortal cell lines.
[02:03:11.029 --> 02:03:13.732]  All the major vaccines are basically grown on immortal cell lines.
[02:03:14.994 --> 02:03:25.986]  They may grow them on eggs at the end of the day, but the original new batches are made in the immortal cell line of an aborted boy who was eight and a half months old and his mother in 1966.
[02:03:27.648 --> 02:03:31.191]  And they found that his cells, because they've tested millions of people's cells, dead people.
[02:03:31.872 --> 02:03:32.813]  Babies they killed and others.
[02:03:33.553 --> 02:03:42.178]  Most people's cells won't keep dividing and won't grow in any type of medium and so they've got two major cell lines they like to use best.
[02:03:42.538 --> 02:03:46.300]  It's a dead black woman from 1951 and a dead white boy from 1966.
[02:03:48.201 --> 02:03:59.688]  You can start with one single cell and multiply it again and again and then freeze all of those cells with which you can then make vaccines.
[02:04:00.339 --> 02:04:01.921]  And they keep growing their cells.
[02:04:02.402 --> 02:04:09.510]  I've seen some estimations that Henrietta Lacks, they've probably grown the equivalent of 20 million of her.
[02:04:10.371 --> 02:04:12.514]  They don't grow up her whole body, they just clone her cells.
[02:04:12.874 --> 02:04:13.775]  This lady don't die.
[02:04:14.536 --> 02:04:18.321]  She'll grow on a tabletop in sunlight, her cells will.
[02:04:18.801 --> 02:04:19.262]  They're magic.
[02:04:20.163 --> 02:04:20.743]  They're the best!
[02:04:21.083 --> 02:04:28.606]  The surprising tenacity of her cancer cells, which made them so important to medical research, also, ultimately, took her life.
[02:04:29.206 --> 02:04:32.808]  Henrietta Lacks died in October 1951, at the age of 31.
[02:04:34.268 --> 02:04:43.212]  As her cells were taken without her knowledge, in an era before the concept of informed consent existed, Henrietta died never knowing how important her cells would be.
[02:04:43.812 --> 02:04:48.696]  You know, it's been 70 years since medical experts took Henrietta Lacks' cancerous cells.
[02:04:49.136 --> 02:04:59.204]  Her family has filed a civil lawsuit against Thermo Fisher Scientific, one of the world's leading biotech companies, for taking her cells without permission.
[02:04:59.624 --> 02:05:07.671]  The lawsuit claims the company made a conscious choice to sell and mass-produce Lacks' living tissue cells without consent.
[02:05:08.171 --> 02:05:12.093]  Her cells were the first human cells to successfully be cloned.
[02:05:12.573 --> 02:05:14.954]  Since then, they've been used in medical research.
[02:05:15.375 --> 02:05:24.239]  The lawsuit also accuses Thermo Fisher Scientific of making staggering profits off of locks, when not even compensating her family at all.
[02:05:25.220 --> 02:05:30.022]  They came in and saw her, decided not to operate on her, just because, you know, they were shooting blacks up with syphilis back then, this mad scientist.
[02:05:30.342 --> 02:05:31.903]  The ones that trained Fauci, it's the same people.
[02:05:32.543 --> 02:05:33.784]  They just pass on the club.
[02:05:35.129 --> 02:05:39.474]  And, uh, she came in, had that tumor, and they said, you just come back and see us in a couple weeks.
[02:05:39.514 --> 02:05:40.255]  She was dead.
[02:05:40.275 --> 02:05:43.319]  That tumor ate large portions of her body.
[02:05:43.339 --> 02:05:44.861]  And they said, let's take her away and check her.
[02:05:44.881 --> 02:05:46.383]  We've never seen cancer grow like this.
[02:05:48.243 --> 02:05:50.464]  Bad scientists won't play God and they are on you now.
[02:05:51.145 --> 02:05:54.246]  They're growing clones, they're splicing humans and animals, they're doing it all.
[02:05:54.586 --> 02:05:55.587]  And they want you out of their way.
[02:05:55.627 --> 02:05:59.169]  Well, what did Fauci and the head of the HHS and the rest of them say in that video from 2019?
[02:05:59.209 --> 02:06:03.091]  They said, we need a big deadly virus out of China to get released.
[02:06:03.371 --> 02:06:05.432]  We can stampede everybody and do whatever we want.
[02:06:06.012 --> 02:06:08.012]  and just totally take over.
[02:06:08.012 --> 02:06:10.351]  (explosion)
[02:06:10.351 --> 02:06:18.172]   Hi there, I'm Kate Dally, your guest host today from the Kate Dally Show.
[02:06:18.155 --> 02:06:24.559]  Happy to be here and happy to address a really big issue, big picture issue today.
[02:06:24.699 --> 02:06:27.621]  I love doing the backstory to things and that's what I'm going to do today.
[02:06:27.641 --> 02:06:30.103]  I want to address our perspective.
[02:06:30.383 --> 02:06:35.286]  Our perspective is hugely important to what's happening right now and how we view the world.
[02:06:35.626 --> 02:06:38.028]  And this could be a really, really powerful hour.
[02:06:38.348 --> 02:06:40.650]  Maybe we'll even hit some light bulb moments for you.
[02:06:40.730 --> 02:06:42.391]  Maybe you know everything I'm about to say.
[02:06:42.851 --> 02:06:46.274]  But nonetheless, we have a huge division in this country.
[02:06:46.294 --> 02:06:58.823]  I was thinking about this a while back, and I was thinking about our fears, and how the vaccinated fear the unvaccinated, like we're, you know, gonna kill them off at any moment, even though they're healthy.
[02:06:59.483 --> 02:07:07.309]  And how the unvaccinated are nervous about being around the vaccinated, because I think they're a walking biological weapon.
[02:07:07.669 --> 02:07:13.514]  So you have a clear division in the country where a third of the country really does fear the vaccinated.
[02:07:14.074 --> 02:07:15.796]  And so how do we get to that point?
[02:07:16.156 --> 02:07:17.417]  There's two sets of fears.
[02:07:17.597 --> 02:07:23.162]  There's a set of fears on the left for the leftist and a set of fears on the right for conservatives.
[02:07:23.842 --> 02:07:28.005]  And the interesting issue here is that we both have a set of fears.
[02:07:28.786 --> 02:07:33.890]  The fears on the left would be, I fear germs are going to kill me at any moment.
[02:07:34.270 --> 02:07:36.432]  I fear the climate is going to come get me.
[02:07:37.332 --> 02:07:42.636]  Every decade, at the end of every decade, I'm either going to be a shish kebab or I'm going to be a frozen rotunda, you know?
[02:07:43.457 --> 02:07:48.961]  And that everybody needs to be controlled by government or we'll be wild animals, right?
[02:07:48.981 --> 02:07:50.582]  This is the belief system.
[02:07:51.801 --> 02:08:13.059]  On the conservative side, or they'll call, you know, they'll mock it and say it's a conspiracy theory side, it's more or less, hey, the deep state will take liberty, our liberty, and there is a new world order, and they have some well-laid plans, and they might crash the economy to build their wealth and power.
[02:08:13.759 --> 02:08:24.094]   Well, if you look back in history, you know, centuries of generations History is only going to prove one set of those fears to be true.
[02:08:25.014 --> 02:08:25.795]  Can you guess which one?
[02:08:27.176 --> 02:08:29.539]  So, what keeps us divided?
[02:08:29.779 --> 02:08:31.000]  What keeps us on this track?
[02:08:31.200 --> 02:08:34.143]  And you know what the one question we're horrible at asking?
[02:08:34.921 --> 02:08:43.667]  And after being on the radio for 10 years, I can tell you this with straight up conviction, is the fact that we never ask what caused that.
[02:08:44.287 --> 02:08:45.728]  What caused World War II?
[02:08:45.788 --> 02:08:47.530]  What caused Great Depression?
[02:08:47.610 --> 02:08:50.992]  What caused the CDC to have more power than the doctors?
[02:08:51.352 --> 02:08:53.874]  What caused polio to spike in the first place?
[02:08:54.094 --> 02:08:55.075]  Nobody asks this.
[02:08:57.463 --> 02:08:58.303]  The backstory?
[02:08:58.404 --> 02:09:07.308]  The backstory is really, really a game changer, because if we understand true history to everything, it takes away power from the cockroaches that think they rule the world.
[02:09:07.708 --> 02:09:16.293]  Context is key, history is key, and people are tuning in to hear what Fake G says next, and now it's Halloween.
[02:09:16.333 --> 02:09:20.475]  Can our kids go out and go door-to-door on Halloween?
[02:09:20.915 --> 02:09:21.736]  Give me a break!
[02:09:22.536 --> 02:09:27.403]  Well, I want to go somewhere, and I kind of want to do the broad picture here.
[02:09:28.024 --> 02:09:30.768]  Have you heard of William Henry Welch?
[02:09:31.288 --> 02:09:34.088]  He was foushee back in the day.
[02:09:34.088 --> 02:09:36.788]  And he was groomed.
[02:09:36.788 --> 02:09:37.587]  He was funded.
[02:09:37.587 --> 02:09:38.488]  He was willing.
[02:09:38.488 --> 02:09:41.887]  He was born in the late 1800s.
[02:09:41.887 --> 02:09:43.387]  He was a Yale man.
[02:09:43.387 --> 02:09:46.188]  Skull and bones all the way, baby.
[02:09:46.437 --> 02:09:47.198]  Of course he was.
[02:09:48.538 --> 02:09:49.998]  Why am I even shocked anymore?
[02:09:51.379 --> 02:09:55.900]  The Rockefellers really wanted to take control of the medical field and Welch was their guy.
[02:09:55.920 --> 02:10:05.462]  And I'm hopefully going to go over some things that maybe have not really been brought to light out there because there's a big understanding that needs to take place.
[02:10:06.022 --> 02:10:14.569]  In how they wanted to take over pharma and exactly how the public health arrived, right, and got the power that it got.
[02:10:15.209 --> 02:10:29.481]  So, in his biography, in Welch's biography, there's a single sentence that really caught my eye and it was that he went over to Germany after Yale to be trained and then come back here.
[02:10:30.822 --> 02:10:32.363]  Why in the world did he have to go to Germany?
[02:10:33.260 --> 02:10:34.703]  Ooh, the backstory.
[02:10:34.963 --> 02:10:43.219]  So, the Rockefellers had a plan to engineer Johns Hopkins as the hub of the newly organized crime medical community.
[02:10:43.599 --> 02:10:45.303]  And I don't say that lightly, I really mean that.
[02:10:46.025 --> 02:11:06.003]  In 1913, the Rockefeller Foundation sponsored a conference on the need for public health education in the United States, and the Welch-Rose Report of 1915 laid out the need for adequately trained public health workers, and then envisioned an Institute of Hygiene for the United States.
[02:11:06.952 --> 02:11:21.806]  So this report reflected that these different preferences of the plans to architects, you had Welch on one side, he favored scientific research, and then you had Wycliffe Rose who wanted the emphasis on public health practices.
[02:11:22.467 --> 02:11:44.450]   So Welch was about to become their first director when they designated Johns Hopkins as the new hub of what was going to become And when Welch went off to Germany, he was getting well-trained in the new study of chemicals, pathogens from the scientists, right, who were working on these at the time.
[02:11:45.210 --> 02:11:48.731]  And so up until the 1900s, we had the town doctor, didn't we?
[02:11:49.212 --> 02:11:52.753]  The town doctor, you had a problem, you went to the town doctor, you got some help.
[02:11:52.853 --> 02:11:57.354]  The doctor had all kinds of remedies, natural and otherwise, time-tested remedies.
[02:11:58.047 --> 02:12:00.189]  Some, you know, they needed some work.
[02:12:00.649 --> 02:12:01.990]  Some were great.
[02:12:02.311 --> 02:12:04.232]  They were respected amongst the town people.
[02:12:04.272 --> 02:12:07.315]  We had midwives, we had doctors, we had all kinds of people helping, right?
[02:12:08.415 --> 02:12:15.821]  Well, the Rockefellers wanted to change all that and they wanted to make sure that they could absolutely take the power away from the doctors.
[02:12:15.841 --> 02:12:16.842]  Well, how did they do it?
[02:12:17.443 --> 02:12:19.124]  They designed a new role for them.
[02:12:20.025 --> 02:12:29.868]   The use of chemicals or pharma was just taking root and this was a really great time to take control of the doctor's training.
[02:12:29.868 --> 02:12:37.068]   And what they really wanted to do was pigeonhole the doctors into only one aspect of medicine,
[02:12:37.068 --> 02:12:40.428]  diagnosing symptoms and giving a prescription.
[02:12:40.428 --> 02:12:41.627]  That was it.
[02:12:41.627 --> 02:12:43.988]  That's what they wanted the doctors to do.
[02:12:43.988 --> 02:12:51.868]   Johns Hopkins as the hub and Welch as their new director would have to invent or insert
[02:12:51.868 --> 02:12:55.347]  a need for public health, a new entity.
[02:12:55.279 --> 02:13:03.561]  This is going to be intertwined in government by controlling many of the things that doctors did and really taking away what really made doctors special.
[02:13:03.741 --> 02:13:05.342]  And that was that they were treating health.
[02:13:06.182 --> 02:13:12.663]  OK, so in America, in a free country, there's no need for public health, right?
[02:13:13.124 --> 02:13:15.124]  You wouldn't need government controlled health.
[02:13:15.604 --> 02:13:16.384]  You have doctors.
[02:13:16.664 --> 02:13:18.785]  People have the freedom to go to whatever doctor they want.
[02:13:19.511 --> 02:13:20.651]  You get sick, you go.
[02:13:20.971 --> 02:13:22.652]  Problem solved.
[02:13:22.792 --> 02:13:32.134]  You don't need a government-controlled agency, and you don't need the government-controlled agency to tell you to wash your hands 50,000 times a day.
[02:13:32.734 --> 02:13:33.855]  Getting really tired of that.
[02:13:35.115 --> 02:13:36.055]  You just need a good mom.
[02:13:36.195 --> 02:13:46.418]  A good mom can cover that base, but they wanted to take over most of the duties of the doctor, and they needed an opportunity to showcase how important it was to have public health on the scene.
[02:13:47.614 --> 02:13:51.555]  It was kind of like that mantra of, see, you really, really need me.
[02:13:52.976 --> 02:13:54.016]  You can't live without me.
[02:13:54.076 --> 02:13:55.177]  See how important I am?
[02:13:55.777 --> 02:14:06.481]  They had to invent a way to make sure that you realized that what they were about to propose was going to be different and better for America.
[02:14:07.261 --> 02:14:13.543]  Public health was going to take over prevention and all of the other things that doctors didn't do.
[02:14:16.885 --> 02:14:19.885]  history like we had never seen before.
[02:14:19.885 --> 02:14:25.644]   And so Welch, now the director of Johns Hopkins, the Rockefeller creation, saw that people
[02:14:25.644 --> 02:14:29.404]  had hookworm in the southern states.
[02:14:29.404 --> 02:14:34.164]   This was rarely fatal and it affected people in the southern states.
[02:14:34.164 --> 02:14:36.685]  They would walk around barefoot.
[02:14:36.685 --> 02:14:40.845]   But this wasn't really something that was killing people off.
[02:14:40.845 --> 02:14:45.005]  It wasn't like the biggest problem that we had on our hands.
[02:14:45.005 --> 02:14:52.085]   And they decided to pinpoint this as the catalyst, as the driving point to make themselves a
[02:14:52.085 --> 02:14:56.685]   role, to give themselves a role, I should say, and make themselves important in our
[02:14:56.685 --> 02:15:00.685]  lives so that we couldn't live without them.
[02:15:01.494 --> 02:15:05.694]   When I come back, I want to tell you a little bit about what they did with hookworm because
[02:15:05.694 --> 02:15:08.574]  it was a little bit what they're doing today.
[02:15:08.574 --> 02:15:14.374]   You've got COVID flu, COVID pneumonia, COVID cold, you know, very rarely is it going to
[02:15:15.018 --> 02:15:19.000]  Every single state in the union is under 0.0 and then whatever number.
[02:15:19.020 --> 02:15:22.082]  I mean, it's not even like it gets a full digit.
[02:15:22.522 --> 02:15:25.104]  So, they use the same playbook.
[02:15:25.964 --> 02:15:27.845]  And when we come back, I want to tell you how they did it.
[02:15:28.606 --> 02:15:32.448]  And then I want to tell you where this is leading and why when we come back.
[02:15:32.588 --> 02:15:37.991]  So, and I want to talk a little bit about pharma and about the use of chemicals.
[02:15:39.326 --> 02:15:40.166]  So stay tuned.
[02:15:40.466 --> 02:15:44.047]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host, the Kate Dally Show, katedallyradio.com.
[02:15:45.367 --> 02:15:49.228]  Back with you, Kate Dally from the Kate Dally Show, katedallyradio.com.
[02:15:49.248 --> 02:15:56.650]  I'm glad you're joining me for this because sometimes we need to kind of go over the big picture just a little bit to understand why we're here.
[02:15:57.270 --> 02:16:02.091]  Why are we asking Fauci if our kids can trick or treat if it's safe enough?
[02:16:02.131 --> 02:16:03.332]  Can you even imagine?
[02:16:03.352 --> 02:16:06.092]  Can you imagine the power that they've amassed?
[02:16:07.333 --> 02:16:07.713]  Sickening.
[02:16:08.473 --> 02:16:08.853]  Sickening.
[02:16:10.859 --> 02:16:19.266]  And the more we see it, and the more people that see it, and the more eyeballs that wake up to what's going on, maybe they'll see it in a completely different way that they can't unsee.
[02:16:19.366 --> 02:16:20.668]  That usually happens with truth.
[02:16:21.749 --> 02:16:26.533]  So, they were using Hookworm Public Health to carve out a niche for themselves.
[02:16:27.073 --> 02:16:29.075]  Not even a niche, really just to take over.
[02:16:29.275 --> 02:16:31.177]  They really wanted to take over healthcare.
[02:16:33.980 --> 02:16:39.984]  They told the people, well, if you just use these Epsom salts and drink this stuff, you'll be great.
[02:16:40.464 --> 02:16:41.805]  Well, people did.
[02:16:41.825 --> 02:16:42.386]  They got better.
[02:16:42.686 --> 02:16:44.387]  It was something that the doctors could have done.
[02:16:45.368 --> 02:16:52.313]  But instead of the doctors doing it, public health decided to kind of put their stamp on, look at us, look at us.
[02:16:52.773 --> 02:16:59.358]  And so they took credit for the eradication of hookworm, right?
[02:17:00.258 --> 02:17:14.758]   And so what happened was, They divided up this healthcare and they basically wanted to tell the doctors, you're only going to be involved with what is the matter with me, when a patient says that, and what can be done to relieve me.
[02:17:15.078 --> 02:17:15.719]  And that's it.
[02:17:15.919 --> 02:17:17.060]  That's all you're going to do.
[02:17:17.540 --> 02:17:26.324]  And public health gets to do the prevention, the mode of spread, the methods of preventing, the identification, the analysis, everything.
[02:17:26.945 --> 02:17:29.186]  They were taking more power than the doctors even realized.
[02:17:30.137 --> 02:17:35.681]  So Welch designed Johns Hopkins around sort of what he learned in Germany.
[02:17:36.602 --> 02:17:39.824]  And I bet you did not see that coming.
[02:17:40.465 --> 02:17:50.392]  Anyway, Welch's prominent students included Walter Reed, of course, Walter Reed Medical Center, and he was also the president of the new American Medical Association.
[02:17:50.892 --> 02:17:58.398]  The AMA became the gatekeeper for deciding what training our doctors would get.
[02:17:59.798 --> 02:18:03.640]  Welch was also the founding editor of Journal of Experimental Medicine.
[02:18:04.701 --> 02:18:04.901]  Yeah.
[02:18:05.221 --> 02:18:05.842]  Did you catch that?
[02:18:06.222 --> 02:18:07.763]  Experimental medicine.
[02:18:08.583 --> 02:18:09.224]  What are we doing now?
[02:18:09.744 --> 02:18:11.005]  Experimental medicine.
[02:18:11.705 --> 02:18:18.469]  The scientists that he studied with over in Germany were creating, I mean, discovering things like anthrax.
[02:18:19.290 --> 02:18:20.410]  Boy, you just discover it.
[02:18:20.470 --> 02:18:21.131]  That's interesting.
[02:18:21.751 --> 02:18:26.954]  Anyway, it all started in the 1800s with the discovery of synthetic dyes.
[02:18:28.035 --> 02:18:28.475]  Interesting.
[02:18:29.008 --> 02:18:30.189]  Dying dyes.
[02:18:31.609 --> 02:18:34.811]  Anyway, dyes for clothing, that sort of thing.
[02:18:34.991 --> 02:18:36.132]  And this became the start.
[02:18:36.192 --> 02:18:37.412]  Actually, it was the color mauve.
[02:18:38.173 --> 02:18:40.594]  This became the start of chemical medicine.
[02:18:41.174 --> 02:18:46.457]  And the Hoyt Company started out in 1863 on the main river near Frankfurt.
[02:18:46.657 --> 02:18:56.602]  At the time, its entire capital consisted of three horsepower steam engines, a small boiler in which they burnt arsenic acid and aniline oil.
[02:18:57.162 --> 02:19:00.487]  And they produced a synthetic fuchsia dye.
[02:19:00.727 --> 02:19:01.669]  That's where it all started.
[02:19:02.230 --> 02:19:03.632]  That's why we have pharma today.
[02:19:04.773 --> 02:19:09.000]  And before that, we used natural dyes, colors from plants and so forth.
[02:19:09.040 --> 02:19:11.103]  And so then we started changing it up.
[02:19:11.667 --> 02:19:20.975]  Well, IG Farben, Hoist Bear, all of those companies merged together to design pharmaceuticals and dangerous concoctions, and that's kind of where it started.
[02:19:21.435 --> 02:19:27.781]  Welch went over to train with them in the latter part of the 1800s when they were doing some of their best work.
[02:19:28.777 --> 02:19:28.997]  Ouch.
[02:19:29.678 --> 02:19:38.025]  Welch, now the director of Johns Hopkins, would be instrumental in cementing the Rockefeller government-controlled healthcare right along with the introduction into pharma.
[02:19:38.445 --> 02:19:49.454]  And so, holistic medicines, natural remedies, they would start to get demonized in lieu of bringing pharma that would deliver, you know, these remedies that gave side effects and other illnesses.
[02:19:50.054 --> 02:19:52.076]  We would become the perpetual patient.
[02:19:53.832 --> 02:19:58.719]  Pharma was salivating at this and so the Flexner Report of 1910 came out.
[02:19:59.119 --> 02:20:05.548]  It did the damage to holistic medicine and natural remedies and even marijuana, CBD.
[02:20:07.009 --> 02:20:18.439]  Abraham Flexner was told by John D. Rockefeller to run around the country and evaluate the effectiveness of all the therapies taught in medical schools and other institutions of the healing arts.
[02:20:18.560 --> 02:20:28.549]  And Rockefeller wanted to dominate over petroleum, petrochemicals, and pharmaceuticals, which were derived from coal tars or crude oil.
[02:20:29.429 --> 02:20:37.277]   And he arranged for his company, Standard Oil of New Jersey, Senior Prescott Bush?
[02:20:37.518 --> 02:20:45.299]  Anyway, Standard Oil, to obtain a controlling interest in this huge German drug cartel called IG Farben.
[02:20:45.999 --> 02:20:53.000]  And the total number of medical schools in the United States went from 160 on down to 69 schools.
[02:20:53.700 --> 02:20:56.161]  Why did it cut into about a third?
[02:20:56.461 --> 02:20:59.681]  Well, it was all about controlling the training of the doctors.
[02:20:59.741 --> 02:21:20.599]   The new foundation of orthodox medicine is based on Louis Pasteur's germ theory, it's completely flawed and what it means is a disease condition is viewed by the orthodoxy as this isolated event, like an infection or a virus and the new training of treatment would be chemical solution or surgery to cut it out.
[02:21:21.159 --> 02:21:27.343]  Alternative medicine had explored all these stressors and why it happened and treat the cause, right?
[02:21:27.623 --> 02:21:28.664]  It's all about health.
[02:21:29.064 --> 02:21:30.365]  So Welch was brought in.
[02:21:31.025 --> 02:21:32.647]  And I find this is so fascinating.
[02:21:32.727 --> 02:21:37.653]  Welch was brought in to help solve the problem of the 1918 Spanish Flu.
[02:21:37.893 --> 02:21:38.834]  Remember when I mentioned that?
[02:21:39.515 --> 02:21:50.107]  The 1918 Spanish Flu where we conflated all the numbers over and over again in history and now it's like triple, quadruple the amount of deaths because we said they didn't know how to count back in 1918.
[02:21:54.651 --> 02:22:01.136]  It was the result of using troops as guinea pigs in the new vaccine experimental program that they had.
[02:22:01.716 --> 02:22:13.425]  Which, by the way, Welch served in the Army and then also he was the one guy that they brought in to help with what they were going to do regarding this issue.
[02:22:13.865 --> 02:22:16.667]  So the Spanish flu attacked healthy people in their prime.
[02:22:17.088 --> 02:22:20.250]  Bacterial pneumonia attacks people in their prime.
[02:22:21.110 --> 02:22:25.992]  And flu attacks the young, the old, and those that are having problems with their immune system, right?
[02:22:26.632 --> 02:22:29.173]  So, was it actually bacterial pneumonia?
[02:22:29.673 --> 02:22:30.473]  Was that the real killer?
[02:22:31.534 --> 02:22:37.015]  Given the fact that they did autopsies, they said, possibly, that was the case.
[02:22:37.716 --> 02:22:38.556]  Just like it is now.
[02:22:38.776 --> 02:22:39.256]  Interesting.
[02:22:39.276 --> 02:22:45.598]  And much of the role that Welch played in that military program, you know, to vaccinate in Kansas.
[02:22:45.758 --> 02:22:47.499]  Interesting that it started at a military base.
[02:22:48.425 --> 02:22:54.047]  So before nuclear weapons, all the chemical companies were the leading role.
[02:22:54.127 --> 02:23:02.731]  They're the ones that came out with mustard gas and Zyklon B and all of these different things that they used in World War II.
[02:23:03.211 --> 02:23:03.511]  Hitler.
[02:23:05.232 --> 02:23:10.494]  That's why Hitler even came to power, was because of IG Farben.
[02:23:10.614 --> 02:23:16.737]  And in 1925, it was decided that the chemical industry, that we would have several cartels.
[02:23:17.791 --> 02:23:21.513]  And IG Farben became IG Farben.
[02:23:22.434 --> 02:23:25.076]  And Hitler would not have become Hitler without him.
[02:23:25.756 --> 02:23:26.857]  They financed him.
[02:23:28.017 --> 02:23:31.519]  And they made sure that he had all of the chemicals he needed.
[02:23:31.740 --> 02:23:32.200]  It's sick.
[02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:38.404]  It just makes me sick to think that we really didn't know what was going on behind the scenes.
[02:23:39.144 --> 02:23:42.786]  And these chemicals would be sadly used in the gas chambers.
[02:23:44.067 --> 02:23:50.948]   And so this is where the American IG Farben A sector of IG Farben also takes root too.
[02:23:51.468 --> 02:23:52.828]  This is where it got going here.
[02:23:53.388 --> 02:23:54.789]  We were under their umbrella.
[02:23:55.149 --> 02:23:56.069]  They had the patents.
[02:23:57.089 --> 02:24:10.293]  And so they did this through a Swiss company called IG Chemie to try to hide the fact that we were part of this German group who eventually faced conviction for war crimes against humanity.
[02:24:10.773 --> 02:24:11.413]  And then they served.
[02:24:13.831 --> 02:24:14.591]  I'll be right back.
[02:24:14.812 --> 02:24:16.793]  Kate Dally Show, katedallyradio.com.
[02:24:16.833 --> 02:24:22.757]  I'm live right after this and you can catch my show at katedallyradio.com and listen live if you'd like.
[02:24:23.357 --> 02:24:23.877]  I'll be right back.
[02:24:23.898 --> 02:24:28.420]  Hi, Kate Dally here from The Kate Dally Show, your guest host for this hour.
[02:24:28.741 --> 02:24:39.668]  And let me tell you, when you kind of get the 30,000 feet up in the air sort of view on this, it's really quite scary how this became the cartel of the century.
[02:24:40.288 --> 02:24:46.129]  I don't know if we really realized it, where they took oil where they wanted it to go.
[02:24:46.790 --> 02:24:52.191]  These particular families whose names come up all the time over and over again.
[02:24:52.971 --> 02:25:03.694]  It's interesting that pharma became what it became, I think really without a lot of people realizing it at the time and for decades, which is really, really scary.
[02:25:04.434 --> 02:25:09.035]  IG Farben, who supplied the chemicals to the gas chambers.
[02:25:11.242 --> 02:25:16.667]  And convicted of war crimes in which they, I think at the very, very most, they only served like four years.
[02:25:17.528 --> 02:25:19.509]  And then we got them out on Operation Paperclip.
[02:25:19.589 --> 02:25:21.831]  Interesting to come over here.
[02:25:22.052 --> 02:25:31.640]  But IG Farben became a shareholder in the New Jersey Standard Oil Company, second only to John D. Rockefeller himself.
[02:25:32.854 --> 02:25:36.276]  And really when it comes down to it, Dulles was involved.
[02:25:36.376 --> 02:25:37.977]  Of course Dulles was involved!
[02:25:38.738 --> 02:25:41.539]  I swear it's the same cast of characters over and over again.
[02:25:42.400 --> 02:25:53.026]  Dulles was personally threatening to cut off Britain's supply of oil during the war if the British persisted with their expose of the American oil connection to IG Farben.
[02:25:53.146 --> 02:25:54.467]  It was all intertwined.
[02:25:55.088 --> 02:26:08.596]   And so what happened was, Nobody ever really asked the question of why didn't the IG Farben building that was used, that everybody used in Germany during World War II, including us, why was it never bombed?
[02:26:08.656 --> 02:26:10.837]  How did everybody escape that?
[02:26:11.237 --> 02:26:15.039]  Why did we make IG Farben command central for our military?
[02:26:15.380 --> 02:26:16.880]  And so here's another question.
[02:26:17.181 --> 02:26:18.862]  Why all the experimentation?
[02:26:19.362 --> 02:26:26.046]  Why did they do the experimentation that they did on people that they were forcing to do it on, right?
[02:26:27.038 --> 02:26:28.038]  During World War II.
[02:26:28.479 --> 02:26:29.779]  And why did Hitler do that?
[02:26:29.839 --> 02:26:30.679]  What was the goal?
[02:26:31.560 --> 02:26:32.260]  What was the goal?
[02:26:32.900 --> 02:26:35.541]  And so that industry had just begun, right?
[02:26:35.661 --> 02:26:41.303]  Pharma experimentations led to a huge explosion in pharma post-World War II.
[02:26:42.224 --> 02:26:43.504]  But they never explained why.
[02:26:43.744 --> 02:26:45.885]  See, we never say, well, what caused that?
[02:26:46.305 --> 02:26:48.406]  It was caused through the experimentation.
[02:26:48.946 --> 02:26:51.027]  That's how sick and demented these people are.
[02:26:52.127 --> 02:26:54.228]  They wanted human guinea pigs.
[02:26:55.663 --> 02:26:59.645]  And you know, it makes me think about right now, what's going on right now.
[02:27:00.205 --> 02:27:02.606]  Demonizing the unvaxxed, right?
[02:27:03.127 --> 02:27:06.168]  And then we have the new dawning of transhumanism coming.
[02:27:06.588 --> 02:27:08.709]  DNA splicing and dicing, CRISPR.
[02:27:09.870 --> 02:27:14.472]  So would our fellow Americans allow this to happen to the unvaxxed?
[02:27:14.551 --> 02:27:16.691]  because look at how they're demonized.
[02:27:16.691 --> 02:27:18.332]  We're really one step away.
[02:27:18.332 --> 02:27:25.490]   And a certain class of society gets demonized and experimented on with this brand new CRISPR?
[02:27:25.490 --> 02:27:26.611]  Is that where we're headed?
[02:27:26.611 --> 02:27:28.150]  And everyone turns a blind eye?
[02:27:28.150 --> 02:27:30.751]  It's really scary.
[02:27:30.751 --> 02:27:38.011]   And so at a time when our history, when we had great sanitation, we finally arrived, right?
[02:27:37.907 --> 02:27:43.950]  We had great sanitation, we had running water, we had all of these things because sanitation was the super spreader.
[02:27:44.350 --> 02:27:50.573]  Sanitation, I mean, vaccines get the credit because of the media and the government, but really and truly it was sanitation.
[02:27:51.093 --> 02:27:52.154]  Bad sanitation.
[02:27:52.734 --> 02:28:03.380]  And so you go all the way back to Moses, you're going to find that he even had rules about being in camp and cleanliness and things like that.
[02:28:03.840 --> 02:28:09.803]  And then after the fall of the Roman Empire, you notice that it completely kind of fell off for a while, didn't it?
[02:28:09.943 --> 02:28:11.304]  All throughout the medieval times.
[02:28:11.904 --> 02:28:14.866]  And they didn't really keep up on it.
[02:28:15.146 --> 02:28:17.628]  I'll say that nicely because people just didn't shower.
[02:28:17.968 --> 02:28:21.250]  There just wasn't that same understanding, okay?
[02:28:21.670 --> 02:28:23.211]  And so, what happened?
[02:28:23.451 --> 02:28:27.034]  Well, sanitation became wonderful.
[02:28:27.234 --> 02:28:42.784]   So, why is it that all of a sudden, think about this, we had to have big pharma come in with all their chemicals, erase holistic medicine, erase natural medicines, and then all of a sudden, We're sitting on more sick people, right?
[02:28:42.844 --> 02:28:45.506]  We have more sick people around the world than we've ever had before.
[02:28:45.947 --> 02:28:46.947]  Makes zero sense.
[02:28:47.588 --> 02:28:49.509]  We finally get the good sanitation.
[02:28:49.850 --> 02:28:58.397]  We finally get to a point where, yes, we should be actually without a lot of disease and illness at this point, especially spreading it.
[02:28:59.337 --> 02:28:59.878]  But we're not.
[02:29:00.398 --> 02:29:02.500]  Now we have more cancer.
[02:29:02.560 --> 02:29:03.521]  We have more disease.
[02:29:03.561 --> 02:29:05.542]  We have more illness than ever.
[02:29:06.463 --> 02:29:07.604]  It doesn't make any sense.
[02:29:09.562 --> 02:29:15.947]  After World War II, they said that there was this huge explosion of illness, right, and disease.
[02:29:16.988 --> 02:29:19.090]  Were they toying with antibiotics at this point?
[02:29:19.550 --> 02:29:19.830]  Yeah.
[02:29:20.271 --> 02:29:23.233]  Could you make the argument that some antibiotics might help?
[02:29:23.774 --> 02:29:28.077]  Well, what are they doing in side effects to the rest of our body?
[02:29:28.357 --> 02:29:29.659]  Do we ever even ask that?
[02:29:30.259 --> 02:29:32.681]  They're using these synthetic chemicals, right?
[02:29:33.161 --> 02:29:36.244]  And so we never ask, well, what caused polio to spike?
[02:29:36.764 --> 02:29:37.705]  What caused it to spike?
[02:29:39.144 --> 02:29:44.886]  They were using DDT on the crops, they were spraying poisons, and then also they were toying with antibiotics.
[02:29:45.766 --> 02:29:52.489]  I would say two good reasons right there to chalk it up to, hey, we see all the sudden spike in polio where there shouldn't be one.
[02:29:53.769 --> 02:30:00.571]  And so then only about 0.5% of people died from actual polio.
[02:30:00.811 --> 02:30:02.252]  I covered this a couple weeks ago, right?
[02:30:02.712 --> 02:30:05.013]  Only 0.5% were actually paralyzed.
[02:30:06.001 --> 02:30:06.961]  That's a whole 1%.
[02:30:07.522 --> 02:30:08.402]  What about everybody else?
[02:30:08.422 --> 02:30:08.402]  99%.
[02:30:09.703 --> 02:30:11.903]  Well, it's a little like what we're dealing with today.
[02:30:12.524 --> 02:30:15.605]  Most everybody gets a cold and they don't freak out.
[02:30:15.665 --> 02:30:16.585]  They're not going to die.
[02:30:17.146 --> 02:30:24.729]  Only a certain small sliver in every single state, you're going to have people that are more sick than that.
[02:30:24.929 --> 02:30:32.712]  Then they go in for the, for the Fauci special, the protocol from hell and killing them.
[02:30:33.552 --> 02:30:33.873]  Uh huh.
[02:30:34.433 --> 02:30:34.673]  Yeah.
[02:30:35.418 --> 02:30:37.920]  That's exactly what they're doing, giving them experimental drugs.
[02:30:38.360 --> 02:30:39.301]  They're really good at it.
[02:30:39.621 --> 02:30:44.244]  They've had really a century and 20 some odd years to work on it, haven't they?
[02:30:44.844 --> 02:30:52.609]  So now we are looking at this kind of situation and saying, well, wait a second, with polio, did we really need a vaccination?
[02:30:52.649 --> 02:30:53.710]  It was already on its way out.
[02:30:54.590 --> 02:30:55.691]  There had been a decade of it.
[02:30:56.712 --> 02:30:57.873]  So why were we doing that?
[02:30:57.913 --> 02:30:59.794]  Why were we jumping to this vaccination?
[02:31:00.768 --> 02:31:02.610]  Well, it involved a lot of government money.
[02:31:03.030 --> 02:31:07.414]  Government money started coming in and supporting these vaccination programs.
[02:31:07.954 --> 02:31:11.657]  So, they give us the fear, right?
[02:31:11.677 --> 02:31:16.301]  The big boogeyman, oh my gosh, everyone's going to die, every child out there is going to be paralyzed.
[02:31:16.941 --> 02:31:18.763]  Parents run the kids in for the shots.
[02:31:18.803 --> 02:31:26.549]  The only problem is, is that half of the shots that were given out at the time were infected with the SV40.
[02:31:27.583 --> 02:31:36.570]  The monkey kidney cell diseased shots that they didn't want to admit to, but they knew full well that they were diseased.
[02:31:37.291 --> 02:31:45.537]  So it's interesting that they use the exact same, almost exact same percentage on this to sell what was coming next.
[02:31:46.218 --> 02:31:47.338]  Smallpox as well.
[02:31:47.919 --> 02:31:50.781]  With good sanitation, you weren't going to see a lot of smallpox.
[02:31:52.002 --> 02:32:03.552]   The 1918 flu result of vaccinations at Of course, military bases where they knew they could use all of these guys as guinea pigs because they had complete control over them.
[02:32:04.313 --> 02:32:05.233]  Are we seeing a pattern?
[02:32:05.954 --> 02:32:10.616]  Then you get to polio and all of a sudden there's something new to work on, folks.
[02:32:10.636 --> 02:32:23.063]  So they start working on it and just as it's starting to wane, and by the way, the polio vaccine was causing so many cases of polio, an incredible amount of cases of polio still is to this day.
[02:32:23.183 --> 02:32:24.244]  I just asked Bill Gates.
[02:32:26.488 --> 02:32:34.493]  Then we start kind of having this quest of vaccination programs, shot programs for kids, right?
[02:32:34.794 --> 02:32:37.175]  You go in and you get a series of shots.
[02:32:37.736 --> 02:32:38.696]  The well visits.
[02:32:39.277 --> 02:32:40.097]  A well visit?
[02:32:40.958 --> 02:32:41.899]  What in the hell is that?
[02:32:42.959 --> 02:32:48.923]  You go to the doctor when you're ill, not when you're well, and you go in for all of these shots.
[02:32:49.804 --> 02:32:55.608]  I look at vaccines much differently, understanding the history of all of this than I ever did before.
[02:32:56.474 --> 02:32:57.334]  And what did we do?
[02:32:57.694 --> 02:33:03.356]  We do this whole, you know, vaccinations are the only thing that has saved us.
[02:33:04.037 --> 02:33:04.997]  Why do we say that?
[02:33:06.077 --> 02:33:08.858]  Well, because they own the media and the government.
[02:33:08.918 --> 02:33:09.398]  That's why.
[02:33:09.418 --> 02:33:11.219]  Pharma gets fed.
[02:33:11.239 --> 02:33:13.820]  Pharma gets fed a lot of illness.
[02:33:14.520 --> 02:33:19.302]  Were all the vaccinations part of a, you know, let's get the immune system down?
[02:33:19.322 --> 02:33:25.944]  Because I'll tell you, the big mantra of the Rockefellers was, you don't have an immune system.
[02:33:26.544 --> 02:33:27.865]  Pharma's here to save you.
[02:33:27.885 --> 02:33:30.427]  Ooh, don't you feel all warm and cozy?
[02:33:30.447 --> 02:33:32.369]  Pharma's here.
[02:33:32.949 --> 02:33:33.289]  Wow.
[02:33:33.990 --> 02:33:36.672]  So yeah, it gets worse too.
[02:33:37.193 --> 02:33:37.933]  I'll come back.
[02:33:37.973 --> 02:33:38.654]  I'll explain.
[02:33:38.754 --> 02:33:44.018]  But yeah, half the country got infected kidney cells in that polio vaccine.
[02:33:44.058 --> 02:33:45.559]  And then what came around the next corner?
[02:33:45.960 --> 02:33:48.021]  More cancer than ever.
[02:33:48.262 --> 02:33:49.963]  And Nixon declared that war on cancer.
[02:33:50.725 --> 02:33:55.090]  That's why I wanted to revisit that, that I did a couple of weeks ago, because it plays into this.
[02:33:55.410 --> 02:33:59.354]  Now we get to see it from a whole different vantage point of the plans.
[02:33:59.374 --> 02:34:00.596]  Hi there.
[02:34:00.636 --> 02:34:01.356]  Welcome back.
[02:34:01.396 --> 02:34:02.137]  Kate Daly Show.
[02:34:02.157 --> 02:34:03.439]  I'm going to do the white man Oprah bite.
[02:34:03.459 --> 02:34:05.801]  I love this music.
[02:34:06.442 --> 02:34:11.948]  Anyway, coming back to this, I just kind of wanted to round up the edges a little bit on this.
[02:34:12.311 --> 02:34:15.811]  and what we're dealing with today, because this is huge.
[02:34:15.811 --> 02:34:23.551]   And once you start to see what's actually happening, then you get a good idea of the whole picture.
[02:34:23.551 --> 02:34:26.012]  And that's really what is dividing Americans.
[02:34:26.012 --> 02:34:29.451]  This is why you have two totally different sets of fears.
[02:34:29.451 --> 02:34:33.831]   One group over here, these leftists think everyone in the world's about to kill them,
[02:34:33.831 --> 02:34:35.051]  the climate's gonna kill them.
[02:34:35.051 --> 02:34:41.432]   And we have conservatives over here and people over here that understand the big picture, know who's at the helm.
[02:34:41.432 --> 02:34:43.771]  And they're saying you are a walking bioweapon.
[02:34:43.771 --> 02:34:47.231]  So two totally different schools of thought, right?
[02:34:47.231 --> 02:34:54.652]   Well, we are not meant to ever cure anyone or help anyone or make sure that they stay healthy.
[02:34:54.599 --> 02:34:59.362]  That's why it's the Center for Disease Control not the Center for Curing Disease.
[02:35:01.784 --> 02:35:03.745]  That's a big statement.
[02:35:04.702 --> 02:35:05.683]  It says a lot.
[02:35:05.823 --> 02:35:11.186]  That we have been guinea pigs for over a hundred years in their game, in their cartel.
[02:35:11.667 --> 02:35:17.891]  And you find it rather disturbing that about 80% of our country is on at least one pharmaceutical?
[02:35:18.671 --> 02:35:24.575]  And that the government turned their attention to mental health and a whole plethora of drugs?
[02:35:25.430 --> 02:35:26.331]  Drugging everybody up.
[02:35:26.371 --> 02:35:29.313]  We're drugging kids from the time they're little, right?
[02:35:29.553 --> 02:35:30.654]  Everything has a drug.
[02:35:30.834 --> 02:35:36.898]  Just here you go, here's a fix it and doctors doing what doctors do and just handing over a script.
[02:35:37.919 --> 02:35:42.402]  Instead of saying what causes that, you know, why are we here?
[02:35:42.482 --> 02:35:46.505]  What is the main mechanism that's causing whatever the problem is?
[02:35:47.285 --> 02:35:50.448]  We didn't have childhood cancer in the 1800s like we have right now.
[02:35:52.069 --> 02:35:54.831]  We didn't have melanoma cancer go through the roof.
[02:35:55.726 --> 02:36:00.430]  Until they encouraged everybody to wear sunscreen from the AMA in the 70s.
[02:36:01.090 --> 02:36:04.553]  If you go look at the chart, and I actually say, you know, go do your own homework on this.
[02:36:04.793 --> 02:36:05.814]  I've looked at these charts.
[02:36:06.274 --> 02:36:09.656]  The numbers skyrocketed the minute they said, go wear sunscreen.
[02:36:10.137 --> 02:36:10.757]  Think about this.
[02:36:10.817 --> 02:36:13.239]  People were out in their fields all the time, right?
[02:36:13.599 --> 02:36:14.320]  For centuries.
[02:36:15.060 --> 02:36:16.541]  They weren't dying of melanoma.
[02:36:17.642 --> 02:36:18.443]  Of course they weren't.
[02:36:19.304 --> 02:36:23.266]  And so all of a sudden we had skin cancer go through the roof.
[02:36:23.806 --> 02:36:27.508]  It was like 2 or 1 in every 100,000 people and then it ballooned to almost 50 in every 100,000 people.
[02:36:27.327 --> 02:36:31.028]  and then it ballooned to almost 50 in every 100,000 people.
[02:36:31.028 --> 02:36:32.028]  That's crazy.
[02:36:32.028 --> 02:36:38.028]  And then doctors are now trained to embrace pharma.
[02:36:37.914 --> 02:36:38.955]  They sell pharma.
[02:36:39.055 --> 02:36:40.597]  They get kickbacks from pharma.
[02:36:40.997 --> 02:36:43.379]  They get kickbacks for the vaccine industry too.
[02:36:43.799 --> 02:36:46.882]  And so pharma is the biggest cartel the world has ever known.
[02:36:47.082 --> 02:36:54.288]  And by the way, the MAMA was found guilty in 1987 by a federal judge and fined a couple of million dollars.
[02:36:54.828 --> 02:37:07.740]   Also, Pharma has even been sued by our own government and of course the source of corruption for many failed experiments that they've done and also lying through their through their teeth again and again and again.
[02:37:07.760 --> 02:37:12.043]  Fauci's lied so many times I can't keep up with the lies.
[02:37:12.424 --> 02:37:15.827]  I don't know why anyone in their right mind would ever actually listen to this hack.
[02:37:17.219 --> 02:37:25.826]  The Rockefeller drug ideology is all about you don't have an immune system and right now this is exactly what they've said for the last 20 months.
[02:37:26.206 --> 02:37:31.350]  You have no immune system, everybody's went kaput, nobody has it anymore and you're screwed.
[02:37:31.950 --> 02:37:38.756]  So you have to take these experimental medications for the mystery COVID bug that's killing everybody, right?
[02:37:38.936 --> 02:37:39.737]  Isn't that what they tell you?
[02:37:40.177 --> 02:37:43.320]  Have you ever actually heard the word immune system come out of Fauci's mouth?
[02:37:43.940 --> 02:37:47.603]  Or a doctor or anyone that is proposing all of this crazy?
[02:37:48.164 --> 02:37:48.884]  Of course you haven't.
[02:37:50.145 --> 02:37:53.608]  And Rockefeller had always had this particular interest in China.
[02:37:54.189 --> 02:37:58.793]  And Standard Oil was the sole supplier of kerosene and oil for the lamps of China.
[02:37:59.313 --> 02:38:03.556]  And then, of course, communism took over, so they kind of went out for a while.
[02:38:03.777 --> 02:38:04.717]  But, oh, they're back in.
[02:38:04.757 --> 02:38:05.318]  Are you kidding me?
[02:38:06.692 --> 02:38:07.893]  Of course they are and we all know that.
[02:38:08.313 --> 02:38:14.035]  Fauci was a big deal for Wuhan and funding it and everything else.
[02:38:14.695 --> 02:38:22.459]  So that brings us to Bill Gates, biggest single donor of WHO, the WHO.
[02:38:23.459 --> 02:38:26.240]  The AMA vets who runs the FDA.
[02:38:27.160 --> 02:38:31.442]  Almost all the experts on COVID come from Johns Hopkins.
[02:38:32.242 --> 02:38:34.643]  All the experts in public health come from Johns Hopkins.
[02:38:35.284 --> 02:38:35.924]  Isn't it amazing?
[02:38:36.761 --> 02:38:39.682]  And no epidemics to justify it.
[02:38:40.142 --> 02:38:51.885]  So they use the tricks of going in and solving a problem that's pretty much solvable by telling you how important they are and how they're saving humanity because it's always going to get the credit.
[02:38:53.266 --> 02:39:00.848]  And then, of course, they named them after foreign countries, you know, the Hong Kong flu, the Asian flu, you know, all of these different flus.
[02:39:01.308 --> 02:39:04.049]  Well, the problem is, is that they're all flu.
[02:39:04.901 --> 02:39:07.503]  Just like pneumonia is pneumonia.
[02:39:07.523 --> 02:39:08.984]  You're going to treat it as a respiratory.
[02:39:09.004 --> 02:39:10.205]  You're going to treat it as a flu.
[02:39:10.626 --> 02:39:12.727]  But they named them from foreign places.
[02:39:12.807 --> 02:39:13.128]  Why?
[02:39:13.188 --> 02:39:15.590]  Because, well, you know, you might need more shots.
[02:39:16.403 --> 02:39:17.044]  You might need more.
[02:39:17.084 --> 02:39:17.984]  Do you feel like cattle?
[02:39:18.064 --> 02:39:21.107]  Do you feel like we should be told to start mooing here?
[02:39:21.127 --> 02:39:27.792]  I mean, that's the feeling I'm getting with the amount of shots they want us to take coming up here in the future.
[02:39:28.373 --> 02:39:35.879]  And so a simple cold, flu and pneumonia all given the COVID label and money comes now from our tax dollars funded to pharma.
[02:39:36.299 --> 02:39:38.061]  Pharma now is in complete control.
[02:39:38.381 --> 02:39:46.267]   So is the government of all of our hospitals with their protocols and they relieve them beyond malpractice With their protocols.
[02:39:46.928 --> 02:39:50.930]  So if you follow the protocol, and you're a hospital and a doctor, you have no liability.
[02:39:51.490 --> 02:39:54.212]  Because malpractice only covers you to a certain extent.
[02:39:56.133 --> 02:39:59.895]  And then we have the statements of, you know, you anti-vaxxer.
[02:40:00.895 --> 02:40:03.637]  That derogatory statement, oh, you anti-vaxxer.
[02:40:04.718 --> 02:40:07.339]  Oh my gosh, I sure hope we're questioning it at this point 120 years later.
[02:40:07.359 --> 02:40:07.499]  Please.
[02:40:07.338 --> 02:40:15.898]   120 years later, please. Good heavens. We are the experimentation and we have been for
[02:40:15.898 --> 02:40:18.618]  120 years and that's the tough part.
[02:40:18.742 --> 02:40:20.262]  That's the tough part to understand.
[02:40:20.622 --> 02:40:39.767]  But you know, truth resonates and once you start seeing this for what it is and the cartel that it is and how they colluded to control medicine and to control what the doctors did and what they didn't and to carve out, not a niche for themselves, but complete and utter control, you start to see it completely different, right?
[02:40:40.748 --> 02:40:41.748]  Gosh, I would hope so.
[02:40:43.228 --> 02:40:45.069]  You know, we're in a weird place.
[02:40:45.109 --> 02:40:48.210]  And by the way, all these notes will be on katedallyradio.com.
[02:40:48.230 --> 02:40:51.711]  You can go check out the notes and all the credit given to all the different sources.
[02:40:52.291 --> 02:40:55.192]  That'll be up today on katedallyradio.com.
[02:40:55.233 --> 02:40:57.133]  Check it out and you can send that as well.
[02:40:57.593 --> 02:41:01.715]  But you know, the thing with the airlines, I just wanted to mention, you know, Southwest.
[02:41:01.975 --> 02:41:03.836]  And Southwest, good on you guys.
[02:41:03.896 --> 02:41:06.377]  I love you guys for standing up for freedom.
[02:41:06.857 --> 02:41:07.357]  I love it.
[02:41:07.657 --> 02:41:12.239]  And boy, everybody should be following this in suits.
[02:41:13.547 --> 02:41:19.528]  I just wanted to say that they're using the government right now by saying we're a government contractor.
[02:41:19.909 --> 02:41:21.209]  We're a government contractor.
[02:41:22.489 --> 02:41:33.552]  When you are Southwest Airlines and you give flights to federal employees, that does not make you now an employee of the federal government.
[02:41:34.292 --> 02:41:37.673]  It means that you did something with the federal government, okay?
[02:41:37.753 --> 02:41:39.173]  But it doesn't make you an employee.
[02:41:39.313 --> 02:41:40.494]  Who signs the checks?
[02:41:41.214 --> 02:41:42.054]  Who signs the checks?
[02:41:42.694 --> 02:41:44.656]  Well, Southwest signs their checks, right?
[02:41:44.916 --> 02:41:47.257]  They are not a government entity.
[02:41:47.298 --> 02:41:49.859]  The checks are not written from the federal government.
[02:41:50.640 --> 02:42:01.148]  But the reason that they're saying that is so that nobody figures out that last year in 2020, they actually, when they were doing the bailouts, they sought to control three industries.
[02:42:01.829 --> 02:42:08.228]   And so Before, when they did bailouts, they never actually assumed ownership, the government, to a certain extent.
[02:42:08.288 --> 02:42:10.029]  But they did in those bailouts.
[02:42:10.370 --> 02:42:13.132]  But they want to keep that quiet because it's very Venezuela.
[02:42:13.332 --> 02:42:15.093]  It's very socialist, right?
[02:42:15.373 --> 02:42:18.816]  To have your government own the airlines, the hospitals, and trucking.
[02:42:19.798 --> 02:42:19.998]  Hmm.
[02:42:20.919 --> 02:42:25.261]  So, what they're saying is, is, oh yeah, we have to mask.
[02:42:25.321 --> 02:42:27.882]  We're a government entity.
[02:42:28.603 --> 02:42:30.304]  We're a government employee.
[02:42:30.344 --> 02:42:31.684]  We're included on that EO.
[02:42:31.724 --> 02:42:33.025]  It's almost like they want to be.
[02:42:33.045 --> 02:42:33.686]  Have you noticed?
[02:42:34.086 --> 02:42:34.506]  Hmm.
[02:42:35.106 --> 02:42:39.809]  And so, of course, the Southwest CEO will stand there and say, I'm all for freedom.
[02:42:39.889 --> 02:42:46.232]  I don't want to force anything, but I kind of want to pretend I'm a federal employee so that I can mask my employees by force.
[02:42:47.273 --> 02:42:49.314]  And not a very American thing to do, is it?
[02:42:50.475 --> 02:42:53.457]  Very, very socialist, very communist.
[02:42:54.198 --> 02:42:59.882]  And so the EO itself does not actually say government contractors in it.
[02:43:00.422 --> 02:43:10.290]  And now we don't even have any written anything that says that any company over 100 has to get vaccinated.
[02:43:10.570 --> 02:43:11.410]  It was a press release.
[02:43:11.430 --> 02:43:12.091]  We all know that.
[02:43:12.451 --> 02:43:14.573]  And so it's all smoke and mirrors.
[02:43:15.093 --> 02:43:16.214]  It's all smoke and mirrors.
[02:43:16.584 --> 02:43:23.106]  And they do want to hide the fact that the government did take apart ownership in their business as well and gives them a lot of funding.
[02:43:23.146 --> 02:43:24.286]  So you always have to follow the money.
[02:43:25.086 --> 02:43:30.888]  But I always find it kind of interesting when they're out in the press and they're giving you a little bit of the runaround, right?
[02:43:30.928 --> 02:43:37.010]  So that you don't see what's actually going on behind the scenes and also claiming something that they actually are not.
[02:43:37.030 --> 02:43:38.610]  It's pathetic.
[02:43:39.171 --> 02:43:40.651]  Stand up and be an American.
[02:43:41.351 --> 02:43:42.751]  You are an American soil.
[02:43:42.871 --> 02:43:44.052]  You are an American.
[02:43:44.092 --> 02:43:45.052]  Start acting like it.
[02:43:45.492 --> 02:43:48.573]  Southwest Airlines and American and United.
[02:43:48.593 --> 02:43:53.014]  You know, I believe in this country and I know you do too.
[02:43:53.394 --> 02:43:58.076]  We love this country and we're not going to let it get it overrun by these cockroaches.
[02:43:58.156 --> 02:43:58.816]  We're just not.
[02:43:59.356 --> 02:43:59.476]  So.
[02:44:00.370 --> 02:44:01.711]  Thanks for tuning in.
[02:44:01.751 --> 02:44:03.631]  Go to katedallyradio.com.
[02:44:03.651 --> 02:44:09.094]  You can get the show notes and you can get these notes as well and I'll be going live in a few minutes there.
[02:44:09.294 --> 02:44:12.655]  You can actually click listen live and you can listen live right from the site.
[02:44:13.175 --> 02:44:15.116]  And I loved Alex's show today.
[02:44:15.156 --> 02:44:16.096]  I thought it was amazing.
[02:44:17.417 --> 02:44:19.778]  And of course, so many great guests.
[02:44:19.818 --> 02:44:21.539]  I'll be interviewing Zelenko today.
[02:44:21.979 --> 02:44:23.739]  So Dr. Zelenko, what a hero.
[02:44:24.079 --> 02:44:33.759]  Thanks you guys.
[02:44:33.804 --> 02:44:34.904]  I've got good news for me.
[02:44:35.005 --> 02:44:39.408]  I've got good news for everybody alive in America and on this planet today.
[02:44:40.228 --> 02:44:46.793]  Now, we spent years developing this, and it's probably one of the strongest, cleanest formulas in the world.
[02:44:46.833 --> 02:44:47.753]  There may be something better.
[02:44:48.194 --> 02:44:48.914]  We don't know about it.
[02:44:48.934 --> 02:44:55.979]  It's made by one of the top labs in the United States that we private label it from, because again, if we said their name, they'd get attacked by the left.
[02:44:56.519 --> 02:44:58.521]  This stuff is incredible.
[02:44:59.361 --> 02:45:06.504]  It is Brain Force Ultra, exclusively available at MFORWARESTORE.COM.
[02:45:06.805 --> 02:45:12.207]  We got a limited run of this in a month ago, and it sold out in three days.
[02:45:13.088 --> 02:45:15.529]  And we already had a larger batch getting developed.
[02:45:16.209 --> 02:45:34.762]  The ingredients came in and the new batch is here and I just took some today and I think it's even stronger than the last batch because this stuff again is done in a lab but it's done organically so each batch varies a little bit but it does get all the testing done to show that it's at least up to a basic strength and this is actually above that.
[02:45:35.122 --> 02:45:37.163]  So we got Brain Force Ultra back in stock.
[02:45:37.543 --> 02:45:42.327]  We got a big shipment in but it's so popular I think it's going to sell out in probably a week.
[02:45:42.867 --> 02:45:49.552]  Despite that, we're going to offer it at 50% off the introductory rate for at least four or five days.
[02:45:49.912 --> 02:45:52.294]  That's why I'm saying it's October 1st.
[02:45:52.914 --> 02:45:54.475]  I'm going to run this until October 5th.
[02:45:54.655 --> 02:45:55.456]  Hell, it may sell out.
[02:45:55.776 --> 02:46:07.604]  And that's good news for InfoWars because we desperately need funding in the face of the Democratic Party assault, their rigged courts, their kangaroo systems, and their attempts to silence us and silence you.
[02:46:07.624 --> 02:46:09.766]  Because that's why they're coming after us is to get to you.
[02:46:09.986 --> 02:46:12.168]  We are all in this together, as Benjamin Franklin said.
[02:46:12.788 --> 02:46:14.709]  And if we don't hang together, we're gonna hang separate.
[02:46:14.969 --> 02:46:20.450]  You've been hanging with us, you've been keeping us on air, you've been spreading the word, and it's having an incredible effect.
[02:46:20.490 --> 02:46:23.031]  In fact, let me spend a minute or so on that before I get back into this.
[02:46:23.871 --> 02:46:26.411]  I had a chance to go up to Glenn Beck's The Blaze.
[02:46:27.232 --> 02:46:30.653]  I had a chance to hang out with Steven Crowder at his offices outside The Blaze.
[02:46:31.033 --> 02:46:38.756]   And I had a chance to meet with a lot of other big reporters and other pundits and A lot of them thought I was full of it 10 years ago or even 5 years ago.
[02:46:38.776 --> 02:46:42.139]  They now see everything I predict to come true and we had a hero's welcome there.
[02:46:42.699 --> 02:46:44.581]  And it's happening all over the place.
[02:46:44.821 --> 02:46:46.262]  But that's because of your support.
[02:46:46.703 --> 02:46:49.525]  If you didn't keep us on air, the world wouldn't be waking up.
[02:46:49.892 --> 02:46:52.814]  When this tyranny launches attack, we would be losing.
[02:46:52.854 --> 02:46:53.635]  We'd be submitting.
[02:46:54.015 --> 02:46:59.599]  But instead, all over the world, from Australia to the United States, people are fighting back and waking up.
[02:47:00.220 --> 02:47:04.843]  And Infowars, at least half the time that we talk to people, is the catalyst that woke them up.
[02:47:04.903 --> 02:47:06.724]  That means you're the catalyst that woke them up.
[02:47:07.105 --> 02:47:09.466]  So again, Brain Force Ultra is back in stock.
[02:47:09.486 --> 02:47:11.428]  You've got to go see what is in this.
[02:47:11.488 --> 02:47:12.389]  Let me just read you some of the things.
[02:47:13.089 --> 02:47:15.169]  Guarana Seed, look at what that does.
[02:47:15.769 --> 02:47:17.350]  Alpha GPC, woo!
[02:47:17.930 --> 02:47:26.631]  Green Coffee Bean, Alethro Root, Yerba Mate Leaf, Green Tea Leaves, Ginkgo Leaf, Ashwagandha Root, and more.
[02:47:26.731 --> 02:47:30.032]  And they are strong, organic, cold-pressed.
[02:47:30.072 --> 02:47:31.272]  This isn't dry garbage.
[02:47:31.532 --> 02:47:32.572]  This isn't old trash.
[02:47:32.932 --> 02:47:34.353]  This is new.
[02:47:34.893 --> 02:47:39.293]  At one of the best labs, I want to say the best, because there might be one better, but it's the best we know of.
[02:47:39.594 --> 02:47:41.934]  And we are so proud to bring you this, and that it funds the M4.
[02:47:42.614 --> 02:47:48.316]  Clean, long, sustained, deep, focused energy where you don't have the crash.
[02:47:48.657 --> 02:47:58.581]  If you love Turbo Force, if you love Brain Force Plus that are both different formulas that are excellent, you're going to absolutely love Brain Force Ultra.
[02:47:59.281 --> 02:48:00.342]  All three are different formulas.
[02:48:00.842 --> 02:48:02.063]  All three do different things.
[02:48:02.443 --> 02:48:05.825]  But I got to tell you, of the three, drop for drop, this is the strongest ever.
[02:48:06.465 --> 02:48:07.045]  50% off.
[02:48:07.425 --> 02:48:08.466]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:48:08.506 --> 02:48:13.028]  And while you're there, check out all the other great products like Ultra 12, Winter Sun, and so many others.
