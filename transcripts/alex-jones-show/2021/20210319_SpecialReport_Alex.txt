[00:00:00.936 --> 00:00:12.119]  The puppet in chief, the stooge, the communist Chinese operative, Joe Biden, collapsed three times on national television yesterday.
[00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:17.001]  And the communist Chinese are celebrating America's weakness right now.
[00:00:17.961 --> 00:00:19.721]  Look at how he steps and look how I step.
[00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:24.003]  Watch how I run up ramps and he stumbles down ramps.
[00:00:24.103 --> 00:00:24.423]  Okay?
[00:00:24.823 --> 00:00:25.103]  Come on.
[00:00:32.674 --> 00:00:34.095]  Karma is a bitch.
[00:00:35.016 --> 00:00:41.441]  That was Joe Biden a year ago during the campaign saying, I'm going to race up those stairs and Trump can't even go down those stairs.
[00:00:42.081 --> 00:00:46.345]  Well, at least Trump, after it rained at a military commencement, was being careful going down the stairs.
[00:00:46.805 --> 00:00:50.668]  No, you certainly race up them and fall down not once, not twice, but three times.
[00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.133]  And then reading all the comments on Twitter and that echo chamber, praising him and saying, why is this news?
[00:00:56.573 --> 00:00:58.534]  Can you imagine if Trump fell down once?
[00:00:59.415 --> 00:01:00.016]  What about twice?
[00:01:00.036 --> 00:01:00.697]  What about three times?
[00:01:01.157 --> 00:01:02.399]  Hillary fell down a few times.
[00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:03.120]  It was a big deal.
[00:01:03.641 --> 00:01:08.227]  But she's well known to have actually no balance, no vision, and has major brain problems just like Joe Biden.
[00:01:08.887 --> 00:01:15.857]  And Joe Biden is emblematic of how this globalist elite is really good at dominating the American people and dividing and conquering us.
[00:01:16.317 --> 00:01:18.840]  But not standing up to Russia, not standing up to China.
[00:01:19.221 --> 00:01:23.627]  It was a communist Chinese just yesterday up in Alaska confronting the U.S.
[00:01:23.687 --> 00:01:27.712]  envoy to China saying, Oh, you have Black Lives Matter.
[00:01:27.752 --> 00:01:33.079]  You can't challenge our Uyghur death camps, our Buddhist or Christian death camps that are thousands of times.
[00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:44.322]  Any crimes committed here against minorities, that's Communist China funding that movement against America, manipulating what they see as tribal and domestic differences in our country.
[00:01:44.602 --> 00:01:48.443]  And Joe Biden, the Democrats on the Chinese payroll have greased the skins for that.
[00:01:48.803 --> 00:01:57.846]  So now they have no respect for Joe Biden and his puppet regime that they financed when they finally put up a meager stand against their tyranny.
[00:01:59.498 --> 00:02:10.021]  Today, we'll have an opportunity to discuss key priorities, both domestic and global, so that China can better understand our administration's intentions and approach.
[00:02:11.301 --> 00:02:23.125]  We'll also discuss our deep concerns with actions by China, including in Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Taiwan, cyber attacks on the United States, economic coercion toward our allies.
[00:02:24.845 --> 00:02:27.766]  Each of these actions threaten the rules-based order
[00:02:28.424 --> 00:02:31.025]  China is firmly opposed to U.S.
[00:02:31.125 --> 00:02:32.966]  interference in China's internal affairs.
[00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:37.528]  We have expressed our staunch opposition to such interference, and we will take firm actions in response.
[00:02:53.891 --> 00:02:54.252]  I think?
[00:03:05.103 --> 00:03:11.449]  There are many problems within the United States regarding human rights, which is admitted by the U.S.
[00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:12.570]  itself as well.
[00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:22.458]  The United States has also said that countries can't rely on force in today's world to resolve the challenges we face.
[00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:31.707]  And it is a failure to use various means to topple the so-called authoritarian states.
[00:03:32.947 --> 00:03:37.731]  And the challenges facing the United States in human rights are deep-seated.
[00:03:37.971 --> 00:03:43.636]  They did not just emerge over the past four years, such as Black Lives Matter.
[00:03:43.916 --> 00:03:45.838]  It did not come up only recently.
[00:03:46.418 --> 00:03:58.488]  So we do hope that for our two countries, it's important that we manage our respective affairs well, instead of deflecting the blame on somebody else in this world.
[00:03:59.068 --> 00:04:05.055]  See, leftists, the enemy isn't conservatives and Christians and capitalists and nationalists that made America so great.
[00:04:05.455 --> 00:04:07.137]  The enemy's authoritarian regimes.
[00:04:07.638 --> 00:04:17.568]  Your authoritarian puppet president, who said that Putin's a killer and that he confronted him and said, you don't have a soul and Russia better watch out, we're about to take major action against him.
[00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:19.731]  So you know Vladimir Putin, you think he's a killer?
[00:04:20.441 --> 00:04:20.781]  Mm-hmm.
[00:04:21.421 --> 00:04:21.681]  I do.
[00:04:21.921 --> 00:04:23.182]  So what price must he pay?
[00:04:23.622 --> 00:04:25.903]  The price he's going to pay, well, you'll see shortly.
[00:04:26.323 --> 00:04:29.684]  So the Russians pulled their ambassadors and challenged Biden to a debate.
[00:04:30.564 --> 00:04:32.625]  And Biden said, oh, I'm too busy playing Mario Kart.
[00:04:32.925 --> 00:04:33.425]  I can't do that.
[00:04:33.445 --> 00:04:35.346]  I'm too busy falling on my face.
[00:04:36.106 --> 00:04:43.208]  No matter how much propaganda comes out from big tech, no matter how much censorship takes place with MSNBC or CNN, it doesn't matter.
[00:04:43.668 --> 00:04:45.689]  Reality is still reality.
[00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:55.524]  And the whole Harvard, Ivy League, globalist, America-hating trash group, a bunch of pedophiles and control freaks, are a cancer, not a cure.
[00:04:55.944 --> 00:04:57.525]  And the whole world's turning against them.
[00:04:57.985 --> 00:04:59.225]  The whole world's rejecting them.
[00:05:00.386 --> 00:05:11.552]  So while General Honore is training to confiscate American people's guns, and they're keeping tens of thousands of troops in D.C., and they're trying to bully Tucker Carlson off the air, remember that reality still exists.
[00:05:12.472 --> 00:05:16.154]  As former President Obama once said, elections have consequences.
[00:05:16.957 --> 00:05:21.500]  Well, in the year 2021, stolen elections have consequences.
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:29.266]  So while the public has fun with this, people go crazy with the memes showing Biden in a wheelchair, Biden with an assisted system going up the stairs.
[00:05:29.826 --> 00:05:31.207]  This is really, really dangerous.
[00:05:31.267 --> 00:05:33.949]  I mean, he just challenged Putin to a major war.
[00:05:34.309 --> 00:05:36.071]  And then of course, Putin challenged him to a debate.
[00:05:36.111 --> 00:05:36.711]  He wouldn't even do it.
[00:05:37.792 --> 00:05:39.833]  This is emblematic of the fall of a Republican.
[00:05:39.873 --> 00:05:46.278]  We have to reject this fraudulent election, reject the Democratic Party, reject the deep state, and reject the globalists now while we still can.
[00:05:47.054 --> 00:06:02.541]  So no matter how big the mainstream media hypes up race war in America and civil war, no matter how many stops they pull out, no matter how much division they sow, at the end of the day, Hollywood and the left and the globalists will still be soulless trash.
[00:06:03.241 --> 00:06:08.624]  And their figurehead is a literal dying, creepy, insane pedophile.
[00:06:09.434 --> 00:06:10.315]  And that's the real world.
[00:06:10.995 --> 00:06:22.263]  I only pray that as Joe Biden collapses and as President Kamala Harris takes the reins, that somehow sanity is discovered again in this country and we stop capitulating and bowing down to political correctness.
[00:06:22.944 --> 00:06:27.007]  America's surrender must end if the world is going to survive.
[00:06:27.807 --> 00:06:32.791]  The people of humanity must come together and reject globalism and neoliberalism or there is no future.
[00:06:33.576 --> 00:06:36.819]  As for me and the InfoWars crew and our viewers and listeners, we'll continue to fight on.
[00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:38.561]  I want to thank you all for your support.

[00:06:45.327 --> 00:06:46.188]  You are the resistance.

[00:07:45.854 --> 00:07:46.435]  It doesn't matter.
