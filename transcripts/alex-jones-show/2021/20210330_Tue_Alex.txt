[00:00:00.219 --> 00:00:06.402]  So here's the headline right here, out of town hall, FBI waives background check requirements for those housing unaccompanied minors.
[00:00:08.042 --> 00:00:10.984]  UN reveals plan to flood America with 600 million migrants.
[00:00:11.864 --> 00:00:14.505]  That's posted to the live show feed today, that full article.
[00:00:16.106 --> 00:00:17.846]  Border surge expected to last months.
[00:00:17.986 --> 00:00:19.667]  It's never going to end, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:22.008 --> 00:00:28.591]  As more people see they're allowed to come in, as they see Biden saying come into the country, surge the border, it's going to happen.
[00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.360]  Biden building giant child smuggling center at Texas border.
[00:00:34.022 --> 00:00:34.845]  We're talking holds 20,000 people.
[00:00:37.093 --> 00:00:39.275]  Here's the original article from NewsWars.com.
[00:00:39.315 --> 00:00:43.078]  Flights from South Texas packed with illegals carrying aid envelopes.
[00:00:43.358 --> 00:00:43.779]  Reports.
[00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:48.603]  So instead of just having photos, we sent the crew in and we got the footage you're about to see.
[00:00:48.683 --> 00:00:49.704]  Exclusive video.
[00:00:50.064 --> 00:00:54.948]  Illegal immigrants with envelopes of cash seen at airport flying around the U.S.
[00:00:55.008 --> 00:00:55.969]  It's totally illegal.
[00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.532]  O'Biden cannot just waive the law.
[00:00:59.612 --> 00:01:01.333]  The zombie puppet president
[00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.653]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:20.157 --> 00:01:20.938]  Make some comments.
[00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:30.507]  And I've said stuff previously, but we are not supporting doing any vaccine passports in the state of Florida.
[00:01:31.267 --> 00:01:33.309]  No one was more aggressive about getting this out.
[00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:43.419]  If you look at all the different points throughout Florida, whether it's a hospital, county health department, a retail pharmacy, a drive-thru sites, church sites, all this stuff, it's important.
[00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.721]  But we always said we want to provide it for all.
[00:01:46.201 --> 00:01:47.542]  But mandated for none.
[00:01:47.702 --> 00:01:54.468]  And that was something that while it was advised to take, particularly if you're vulnerable, we were not going to force you to do it.
[00:01:54.508 --> 00:02:00.032]  So there was never under discussion any mandates to take vaccines.
[00:02:00.072 --> 00:02:03.775]  We will not have COVID vaccines mandated in Florida.
[00:02:04.075 --> 00:02:07.137]  The flip side of that, though, with these vaccine passports is
[00:02:08.158 --> 00:02:21.955]  It's completely unacceptable for either the government or the private sector to impose upon you the requirement that you show proof of vaccine to just simply be able to participate in normal society.
[00:02:22.495 --> 00:02:25.179]  Bigger and older than the Nazis.
[00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:26.820]  Here's what she had to say.
[00:02:27.643 --> 00:02:31.087]  I am in fact a survivor of the Holocaust.
[00:02:31.648 --> 00:02:37.856]  And the first thing I have to tell you that even then nobody told us it was done for our own good.
[00:02:38.717 --> 00:02:40.339]  We all knew what was happening.
[00:02:43.202 --> 00:02:43.343]  And
[00:02:45.032 --> 00:03:00.717]  When I think today, when I see people mad, I think of the Yellow Star, which gave everybody liberty to aggress me, to insult me, to call me a carrier of disease, to spit on me even.
[00:03:01.638 --> 00:03:04.339]  I love you!
[00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:07.740]  I would like to tell you that this is worse.
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:14.022]  It is more insidious, it concerns more people,
[00:03:15.538 --> 00:03:29.421]  It is, it is, there is a hypocrisy in the public narrative that is absolutely unbearable to say that we're doing this to protect the old.
[00:03:30.821 --> 00:03:35.383]  I would love to die in a state that gives me freedom.
[00:03:44.864 --> 00:03:52.405]  It was agreed first that China would have veto power over who even got to be on the mission.
[00:03:53.065 --> 00:03:55.326]  Secondly... And WHO agreed to that?
[00:03:55.646 --> 00:03:56.466]  WHO agreed to that.
[00:03:56.646 --> 00:04:07.548]  On top of that, the WHO agreed that in most instances, China would do the primary investigation and then just share its findings with these international experts.
[00:04:07.568 --> 00:04:13.569]  So these international experts weren't allowed to do their own primary investigation.
[00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:19.690]  You're saying that China did the investigation and showed the results to the committee and that was it?
[00:04:20.251 --> 00:04:21.711]  Pretty much that was it.
[00:04:21.791 --> 00:04:23.471]  Not entirely, but pretty much that was it.
[00:04:23.551 --> 00:04:28.813]  Imagine if we had asked the Soviet Union to do a co-investigation of Chernobyl.
[00:04:29.133 --> 00:04:30.393]  It doesn't really make sense.
[00:04:31.173 --> 00:04:38.775]  In the midst of the worst health crisis we're facing in more than a century, don't tell your supporters, don't be afraid of COVID.
[00:04:39.135 --> 00:04:41.136]  Everyone should be afraid of COVID.
[00:04:42.441 --> 00:04:54.756]  Don't tell your supporters don't be afraid of COVID.
[00:04:55.176 --> 00:04:57.339]  Everyone should be afraid of COVID.
[00:04:57.499 --> 00:04:59.382]  Everyone should be afraid.
[00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.304]  I just want to say they gave me Regeneron.
[00:05:06.885 --> 00:05:09.909]  We have hundreds of thousands of doses that are just about ready.
[00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:15.758]  And if you're in the hospital and you're feeling really bad, we're going to work it so that you get them and you're going to get them free.
[00:05:16.459 --> 00:05:18.141]  And especially if you're a senior, we're going to get...
[00:05:31.158 --> 00:05:33.219]  Everyone should be afraid of COVID.
[00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:35.460]  Everyone should be afraid of COVID.
[00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.721]  Everyone should be afraid of COVID.
[00:05:38.342 --> 00:05:41.943]  Ladies and gentlemen, the New World Order.
[00:05:41.963 --> 00:05:45.045]  Global government isn't coming into view.
[00:05:46.226 --> 00:05:50.608]  It is battering us like a giant, fiery battering ram.
[00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:58.153]  Knocking down, destroying every freedom we've got and annihilating the engines of our prosperity.
[00:05:58.693 --> 00:06:01.534]  We are now not entering the New World Order.
[00:06:02.275 --> 00:06:05.436]  We are now plunging and sinking deeply into it.
[00:06:06.577 --> 00:06:09.658]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live.
[00:06:10.618 --> 00:06:11.259]  Worldwide.
[00:06:12.392 --> 00:06:15.195]  March 30th, 2021 transmission.
[00:06:15.315 --> 00:06:16.557]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:06:17.118 --> 00:06:23.144]  I'm extremely honored to be here and to cover this information and to be the tip of the spear with you.
[00:06:24.766 --> 00:06:25.167]  Wow.
[00:06:25.467 --> 00:06:28.170]  It is official mainstream news.
[00:06:29.292 --> 00:06:36.256]  That the COVID lockdowns are designed to make us live in our houses and be prisoners to, quote, save the earth from carbon.
[00:06:36.656 --> 00:06:38.197]  You know, Debo said it years ago.
[00:06:38.217 --> 00:06:39.818]  They had a plan a few months ago.
[00:06:39.838 --> 00:06:47.662]  They said how great the lockdowns are, have them permanently to save the earth, have robots deliver us all our food, making us obsolete, depopulating.
[00:06:48.803 --> 00:06:57.728]  But now the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the Associated Press, without me even looking today, just everywhere are saying,
[00:06:58.996 --> 00:07:01.377]  We need to be prisoners and never leave our homes again.
[00:07:01.557 --> 00:07:07.200]  I mean, they are just going for full Stockholm Syndrome takeover.
[00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:15.764]  Because they know at least 30% of the public, mainly women, will go under Stockholm Syndrome because it's so authoritarian, they can't believe it's actually happening.
[00:07:17.225 --> 00:07:19.866]  And they are going to submit to the tyranny.
[00:07:19.906 --> 00:07:26.389]  Nothing against women, but it's known in every psychological study, and going back to Rome and Babylon, that when an army would take over a city,
[00:07:27.876 --> 00:07:34.883]  Most of the women within minutes would start fighting for the enemy as soon as it was clear that the enemy had taken over.
[00:07:34.903 --> 00:07:41.389]  And they would rat out their husbands, rat out their children, help execute them if they thought it was for the good of the community.
[00:07:43.271 --> 00:07:47.515]  That's why when a country is conquered or a place is conquered, you don't kill the women.
[00:07:47.895 --> 00:07:49.797]  That's why, who was the house slave?
[00:07:50.766 --> 00:07:54.209]  In Rome, in Africa, who were the house slaves?
[00:07:54.309 --> 00:07:55.810]  Africans had as many slaves as anybody.
[00:07:56.250 --> 00:08:02.475]  You brought women in the house, you kept the men out in the fields, and that's the system.
[00:08:02.556 --> 00:08:05.478]  And so, women are going under Stockholm Syndrome.
[00:08:05.498 --> 00:08:17.988]  Now, a lot of cucked men are wearing the mask and virtue signaling and wanting to stay in and wanting to get their Uber Eats and wanting to commute because they think it's fun and cute and they drink gallons of soy a day.
[00:08:19.451 --> 00:08:22.976]  But this, this, this is the total diabolical takeover.
[00:08:23.136 --> 00:08:31.448]  Where again, it's so over the top, on purpose, to get a lot of people to be subconsciously scared, so they go, well this couldn't be a takeover, I'm just gonna submit to it.
[00:08:32.589 --> 00:08:33.510]  Incredible!
[00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:39.774]  I have a stack of just unbelievable COVID-19 news, but just look at this stack, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:40.115 --> 00:08:41.556]  Look at this that dovetails with it.
[00:08:42.056 --> 00:08:44.558]  If you're a radio listener, you can just search into anything I'm saying, it'll pull it up.
[00:08:44.838 --> 00:08:45.458]  But the crew does.
[00:08:45.999 --> 00:08:46.359]  Look at this.
[00:08:46.459 --> 00:08:46.819]  AP.
[00:08:47.079 --> 00:08:50.322]  Dear Normal, were you really that great in the first place?
[00:08:50.982 --> 00:08:52.343]  By a Sophie Rosenbaum.
[00:08:52.623 --> 00:08:57.807]  This reads like the darkest satire ever written, but it's real.
[00:08:58.508 --> 00:09:00.169]  And I'm going to take the time out, even though this is
[00:09:01.559 --> 00:09:06.164]  Four nightmare pages of evil, and I'm going to read the damn thing on air, bottom of the hour.
[00:09:08.346 --> 00:09:11.829]  And it says, we're going to lock you in your house and you're going to love it.
[00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:14.112]  And you're only going to leave when we say you can.
[00:09:14.392 --> 00:09:16.934]  And it's not about the COVID, it's about the earth.
[00:09:19.357 --> 00:09:19.577]  Wow.
[00:09:20.338 --> 00:09:21.379]  I mean, wow.
[00:09:21.799 --> 00:09:24.061]  They're just going for broke all the way to the end game.
[00:09:25.253 --> 00:09:28.815]  And not doing the sub-steps, I guess, because the public submitted so beautifully.
[00:09:29.096 --> 00:09:30.096]  Whoa!
[00:09:30.316 --> 00:09:36.060]  And it shows people in circles and by themselves and, you know, Biden and his rallies with nobody there.
[00:09:37.501 --> 00:09:40.643]  This is so... And then they admit later it's about carbon.
[00:09:40.663 --> 00:09:44.546]  And I've got all the articles right here admitting that only China will be allowed to go outside.
[00:09:44.626 --> 00:09:45.427]  No one else will.
[00:09:46.728 --> 00:09:53.374]  I'm just total dystopia, maximum evil, out of the gates, just... Wow!
[00:09:54.435 --> 00:09:56.977]  So we've got that information right here for you.
[00:09:59.039 --> 00:10:00.961]  I'm getting chills just every millisecond right now.
[00:10:02.482 --> 00:10:03.643]  And then you've got the fear-mongering.
[00:10:03.683 --> 00:10:06.425]  CDC Director warns of impending doom!
[00:10:06.946 --> 00:10:07.626]  Destruction!
[00:10:07.806 --> 00:10:09.208]  Like a hydrogen bomb, she said!
[00:10:09.508 --> 00:10:10.108]  I'm scared!
[00:10:10.168 --> 00:10:10.789]  Don't come out!
[00:10:11.009 --> 00:10:11.970]  Keep your mask on!
[00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:12.771]  So did Biden.
[00:10:14.693 --> 00:10:17.855]  That's all coming up, but I've been spending usually the first hour on this first.
[00:10:17.915 --> 00:10:29.443]  Now, let me hit the other big news, because we're caught in a globalist, ultra-massive, pincer attack, and it all ties together.
[00:10:30.504 --> 00:10:31.304]  What do they hit us with?
[00:10:31.344 --> 00:10:37.528]  What's in the Banff Canada 2006 world government meeting that was leaked to Lou Dobbs that they confirmed was real?
[00:10:37.949 --> 00:10:40.150]  That I made the film Endgame based on a lot of it.
[00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:42.592]  It's almost a three-hour film, about 20 minutes is on that.
[00:10:44.281 --> 00:10:51.163]  They said we'll use the threat of a virus, then a lockdown that causes migrant refugee surges, and that'll put the U.N.
[00:10:51.204 --> 00:10:56.806]  in charge because we control the third world countries and the refugee centers and the countries have signed on to treaties where the U.N.
[00:10:56.846 --> 00:10:59.807]  controls the refugees and we take directives from the U.N.
[00:11:00.507 --> 00:11:02.728]  Trump, one year into office, got us out of that.
[00:11:03.648 --> 00:11:06.049]  Biden signed it back in on day three.
[00:11:07.209 --> 00:11:09.870]  So we are under officially U.N.
[00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:11.551]  control of our borders.
[00:11:13.444 --> 00:11:14.484]  And that leads us to this.
[00:11:14.584 --> 00:11:19.406]  I wanted to pull this article up from a few years ago just to document why this is all happening.
[00:11:20.307 --> 00:11:24.508]  Revealed UN plan to flood America with 600 million migrants by 2050.
[00:11:25.249 --> 00:11:30.110]  73% population would be immigrants or their descendants.
[00:11:31.451 --> 00:11:32.751]  You see that ladies and gentlemen?
[00:11:32.771 --> 00:11:33.772]  You see that right there?
[00:11:36.191 --> 00:11:38.432]  Oh, but when we did that, Snopes said it wasn't true.
[00:11:38.492 --> 00:11:41.194]  Here's the UN.org, where the documents come from.
[00:11:41.734 --> 00:11:46.456]  Replacement migration is a solution to declining and aging populations.
[00:11:46.677 --> 00:11:55.221]  Here's the actual UN document, the UN Migration Pact, that Obama signed us onto, that we are now under, because Trump pulled us out, they put us back in.
[00:11:55.281 --> 00:11:56.962]  It's all right there.
[00:11:59.283 --> 00:12:00.664]  Isn't that interesting?
[00:12:00.944 --> 00:12:02.905]  And we're going to tie it into the huge news
[00:12:04.821 --> 00:12:12.609]  When we come back on the other side, our team has only been in South Texas for about 27 hours.
[00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:19.796]  They've already found a giant new center that can hold 20,000 people at least being built.
[00:12:20.397 --> 00:12:27.203]  They found other centers being built and have already documented four other giant known centers that have people stacked on top of each other like cordwood.
[00:12:28.226 --> 00:12:42.013]  And then we saw a Daily Call report saying, oh, there are hundreds of illegals with their children and others and unaccompanied children at the airport in South Texas loading onto planes with no ID.
[00:12:43.433 --> 00:12:44.674]  Loading onto planes.
[00:12:46.462 --> 00:13:00.313]  With bags of cash and envelopes of cash controlled by the Democratic Party being sent all over the United States to disappear into God knows what in countervention of federal and state law, which Biden hadn't signed an executive order that could be overturned by courts.
[00:13:00.793 --> 00:13:02.455]  They haven't changed the federal law.
[00:13:02.515 --> 00:13:05.737]  This is all lawlessness on purpose.
[00:13:05.818 --> 00:13:06.918]  And he said, surge the border.
[00:13:07.139 --> 00:13:10.801]  Yeah, there's incredible drone footage that our team just shot yesterday.
[00:13:11.687 --> 00:13:23.795]  And they're so busy collating all of this that it's in the Owen Schroer War Room section, but I'm going to create a border in crisis or border under invasion section at Bandot Video today.
[00:13:23.815 --> 00:13:28.678]  In fact, get the guys that are over Bandot Video, the IT guys, they're the ones that create the new section.
[00:13:29.098 --> 00:13:30.139]  Rob knew it was up until 8 at night.
[00:13:30.159 --> 00:13:31.260]  He can do it, but he's not here yet.
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:32.821]  I understand he's busy.
[00:13:33.221 --> 00:13:34.882]  So I meant to do that before I went live today.
[00:13:35.282 --> 00:13:36.043]  Get them over here right now.
[00:13:36.083 --> 00:13:38.644]  We've got to create that border invasion site so we can say,
[00:13:39.585 --> 00:13:40.285]  We're good to go.
[00:13:59.494 --> 00:14:00.854]  Hide your light under a bushel.
[00:14:01.334 --> 00:14:04.955]  Everybody, go to Bandop Video, the War Room section.
[00:14:05.255 --> 00:14:06.156]  Download the videos.
[00:14:06.216 --> 00:14:07.296]  Re-upload them other places.
[00:14:07.596 --> 00:14:11.357]  And it's key to not give us credit or YouTube, Facebook, or Twitter will ban you.
[00:14:11.837 --> 00:14:15.238]  It is key when you grab our videos and share them, don't use our names.
[00:14:15.278 --> 00:14:16.398]  We don't care about the credit.
[00:14:16.698 --> 00:14:18.499]  We care about saving the country and the planet.
[00:14:20.259 --> 00:14:20.719]  Oh my gosh.
[00:14:20.739 --> 00:14:26.000]  And there's a huge article that we're not hiding the light under a bushel at InfoWars.com.
[00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:28.101]  We're going to cover when we come back.
[00:14:29.352 --> 00:14:32.634]  Breaking Biden building giant child smuggling center at Texas border.
[00:14:33.055 --> 00:14:33.715]  That video.
[00:14:34.336 --> 00:14:34.996]  And then this one.
[00:14:35.397 --> 00:14:39.480]  Flights from South Texas packed with illegals carrying aid envelopes, report.
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:47.606]  Illegal aliens, they call them migrants, this is a UN and third world invasion force, receiving wads of cash flying without ID, witnesses say.
[00:14:48.757 --> 00:14:51.759]  Well, I thought, well, that's in the Daily Caller, that's at newswars.com.
[00:14:51.799 --> 00:14:57.322]  We're 20 miles from that airport, so we went there, bought tickets, got into the airport area, and documented it.
[00:14:57.502 --> 00:14:58.343]  It's coming up.
[00:14:58.943 --> 00:15:01.164]  Exclusive video, infowars.com.
[00:15:02.085 --> 00:15:07.248]  Illegal immigrants with envelopes of cash seen at airport flying around the U.S.
[00:15:07.928 --> 00:15:09.749]  Shocking legal activity caught on camera.
[00:15:09.849 --> 00:15:13.411]  Owen Schroer talked to illegals violating law at behest of Biden.
[00:15:14.352 --> 00:15:16.173]  The Alex Jones Show is live.
[00:15:18.109 --> 00:15:22.551]  From the UN invasion point on the Texas-Mexico border.
[00:15:23.071 --> 00:15:29.333]  The live link is posted at InfoWars.com, Band.Video, and NewsWars.com.
[00:15:31.274 --> 00:15:35.936]  Coming up, Paul Joseph Watson will host the fourth hour today.
[00:15:36.136 --> 00:15:39.097]  Always informative and powerful.
[00:15:41.181 --> 00:15:45.122]  Owen Troyer again is on the border right now.
[00:15:45.142 --> 00:15:52.105]  I want to read you some of these headlines and then we're going to be getting Owen to pop in later in the second hour as well.
[00:15:52.665 --> 00:15:58.827]  Incredible exclusive drone footage because the media is hardly even down there of these giant facilities they're building.
[00:15:59.507 --> 00:16:08.075]  Incredible footage of just hundreds of trucks going in every 30 minutes, building these huge facilities, mushrooming all over the place.
[00:16:08.556 --> 00:16:16.824]  I'm gonna be down there in a few days with a aircraft getting more documentation to give you a high-altitude look, just to give you an idea of how many of these are mushrooming up.
[00:16:18.109 --> 00:16:19.170]  It is all illegal.
[00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:20.791]  Here's the big takeaway.
[00:16:21.412 --> 00:16:33.061]  And so many times I asked the audience to do this and you do a great job, but so many other times I've learned to just get on the phone and call national talk show hosts and call folks that run big national websites like Gateway Pundit.
[00:16:33.401 --> 00:16:46.272]  And I did that this morning and I said to Jim Hoff, who's amazing, and I know Congress pays more attention to his site than even us, and I said, obviously it's important that they are taking illegals, they're taking unaccompanied children,
[00:16:47.571 --> 00:17:04.595]  With no documentation, by the thousands a day, processing them in less than 24 hours, violating federal law, and then just releasing them with bags of cash and no ID at the airport and ordering the TSA to let them violate federal law and regulations and get on airplanes.
[00:17:05.055 --> 00:17:07.135]  And Obama hasn't signed an executive order.
[00:17:09.196 --> 00:17:14.457]  And, again, I keep having a Freudian slip because he is a Biden.
[00:17:15.615 --> 00:17:20.358]  Obama's puppet Biden has not signed an executive order.
[00:17:21.259 --> 00:17:23.680]  Obama didn't do it eight years ago when he got in all the trouble.
[00:17:24.321 --> 00:17:31.826]  And even they had a Senate report saying it was illegal and they smuggled tens of thousands of children into the hands, out of the millions, of sex traffickers.
[00:17:32.506 --> 00:17:39.410]  And then the FBI announced two days ago they're waiving all background checks for the people at the facilities and the foster homes where they're sent.
[00:17:39.831 --> 00:17:44.234]  So they're coming in, no ID, not with their parents in many cases, as young as two years old,
[00:17:45.074 --> 00:17:51.278]  They're being put on buses and airplanes and flown to be picked up by random people and never to be seen again.
[00:17:52.459 --> 00:17:55.401]  But then separately you'll hear, National Amber Alert!
[00:17:55.421 --> 00:17:57.322]  12-year-old girl grabbed out of her backyard!
[00:17:57.702 --> 00:18:02.566]  Massive manhunt shuts down two counties as they search the grid for the kidnapper.
[00:18:03.686 --> 00:18:08.310]  But then you've got massive deaths, massive numbers of dead women and children found by the thousands on the border.
[00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:08.950]  Look it up.
[00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:11.792]  And it's just, oh, that's not going to be a news item.
[00:18:12.052 --> 00:18:13.133]  That's not going to be a story.
[00:18:15.049 --> 00:18:21.232]  So here's the headline right here, out of town hall, FBI waives background check requirements for those housing unaccompanied minors.
[00:18:22.873 --> 00:18:25.814]  UN reveals plan to flood America with 600 million migrants.
[00:18:26.695 --> 00:18:29.336]  That's posted to the live show feed today, that full article.
[00:18:30.937 --> 00:18:32.678]  Border surge expected in the last months.
[00:18:32.818 --> 00:18:34.498]  It's never going to end, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:43.423]  As more people see they're allowed to come in, as they see Biden saying come into the country, surge the border, it's going to happen.
[00:18:45.199 --> 00:18:48.189]  Biden building giant child smuggling center at Texas border.
[00:18:48.851 --> 00:18:49.674]  We're talking holds 20,000 people.
[00:18:51.923 --> 00:18:54.104]  Here's the original article from NewsWars.com.
[00:18:54.144 --> 00:18:57.906]  Flights from South Texas packed with illegals carrying aid envelopes.
[00:18:58.187 --> 00:18:58.607]  Reports.
[00:18:58.967 --> 00:19:03.409]  So instead of just having photos, we sent the crew in and we got the footage you're about to see.
[00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:04.530]  Exclusive video.
[00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:09.793]  Illegal immigrants with envelopes of cash seen at airport flying around the U.S.
[00:19:09.833 --> 00:19:10.794]  It's totally illegal.
[00:19:11.854 --> 00:19:14.336]  O'Biden cannot just waive the law.
[00:19:14.436 --> 00:19:16.157]  The zombie puppet president
[00:19:16.957 --> 00:19:23.690]  He stole the election and is tackling which Kamala are not allowed to just waive law.
[00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:27.056]  The executive order is to be overturned by the courts if they're not based on law.
[00:19:28.561 --> 00:19:38.106]  Remember, Trump had the federal law that he could block countries where people don't have proper passports or connected to terrorism, and it took a bunch of courts saying he was wrong to look out the Supreme Court.
[00:19:38.126 --> 00:19:38.807]  They said he was right.
[00:19:39.227 --> 00:19:41.848]  But that was them battling him over his executive orders.
[00:19:42.088 --> 00:19:45.250]  Biden hasn't even done an executive order because he knows it'll get overturned.
[00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:46.431]  Instead, he just does it.
[00:19:46.631 --> 00:19:53.354]  He just says, surge the border, like rob the bank, rape the child, burn down the building, attack the Capitol.
[00:19:53.534 --> 00:19:54.175]  I'm not saying that.
[00:19:54.215 --> 00:19:55.776]  That's what they're saying.
[00:19:56.476 --> 00:19:57.457]  Attack America.
[00:19:58.377 --> 00:19:59.718]  Attack the capital of freedom!
[00:20:00.999 --> 00:20:03.561]  They are just giving those orders out.
[00:20:04.042 --> 00:20:04.762]  It's lawless.
[00:20:05.223 --> 00:20:07.104]  It's martial law by a dictator.
[00:20:08.265 --> 00:20:09.466]  And those aren't words.
[00:20:11.167 --> 00:20:11.768]  That's what's happened.
[00:20:11.788 --> 00:20:12.428]  Look at this headline.
[00:20:12.689 --> 00:20:14.330]  Illegal alien hit with rape.
[00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:16.912]  Murder charges in killing a newborn baby.
[00:20:17.332 --> 00:20:20.715]  But it won't be like when it's an American baby or a white baby killed.
[00:20:20.975 --> 00:20:22.937]  He killed his own child so he's gonna get in trouble.
[00:20:23.557 --> 00:20:25.019]  Raped his own son to death.
[00:20:25.079 --> 00:20:25.979]  Buried him in the backyard.
[00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:28.342]  He'd already been involved in a bunch of crimes.
[00:20:28.563 --> 00:20:31.787]  Sanctuary cities kept letting him go over and over again.
[00:20:31.808 --> 00:20:38.798]  He lived in a sanctuary city in California, and the police wanted to arrest him, but they couldn't because they said he's above the law.
[00:20:39.119 --> 00:20:41.222]  So he raped and killed his son with enjoyment.
[00:20:43.542 --> 00:20:47.225]  NBC scanning, oh yeah, the son was a baby too, two years old.
[00:20:47.265 --> 00:20:50.487]  But that's okay, because I mean, I guess his skin's a little brown, so it's all right.
[00:20:51.348 --> 00:20:55.791]  NBC scanning 17,000 hours of WWE content looking for racist material.
[00:20:56.051 --> 00:20:58.313]  Well, thank God that's going on, that'll fix it.
[00:20:58.813 --> 00:21:02.496]  And they're teaching students all over the world that being a boy is inherently bad and you're a rapist.
[00:21:02.876 --> 00:21:05.638]  This is all just mass mind control and radical race theory.
[00:21:05.918 --> 00:21:12.143]  Here's part of the Owen Schroer report from the airport in South Texas on the border last night.
[00:21:12.799 --> 00:21:23.727]  Ladies and gentlemen, Owen Troyer here, and we are in McAllen, Texas, at an airport in Hidalgo, Texas, where it just came out, and we have the story at NewsWars.com.
[00:21:24.708 --> 00:21:29.872]  Flights from South Texas packed with illegals carrying aid envelopes, according to reports.
[00:21:30.492 --> 00:21:33.515]  Now this just broke this evening on Monday, March 29th.
[00:21:34.235 --> 00:21:37.518]  And so we just got this information about two and a half hours ago.
[00:21:38.218 --> 00:21:44.365]  So immediately we figured, well let's get into the airport and let's see if we can find this happening in live time.
[00:21:44.906 --> 00:21:49.310]  Without but three hours of notice to try to find this.
[00:21:50.592 --> 00:21:52.334]  Here's just a brief preview of what we got.
[00:21:53.890 --> 00:22:11.738]  This is an original photo from me that I just got and these the family it was a family of four That had this and it was it was filled with stuff I don't know what this was from a family of four As you can see it has their flights and the airports and everything on it Now when I went up to try to talk to them
[00:22:13.095 --> 00:22:15.357]  I realized that they can't speak English.
[00:22:16.277 --> 00:22:18.519]  And so, uh, we had to kind of speak a little Spanish.
[00:22:18.539 --> 00:22:19.339]  We had to video this.
[00:22:19.359 --> 00:22:20.840]  We're going to post it to Banda Video.
[00:22:21.481 --> 00:22:24.843]  And basically, they were just trying to figure out where their flight is, what gate they go to.
[00:22:24.903 --> 00:22:26.184]  So I had to show them.
[00:22:26.244 --> 00:22:27.545]  I said, oh, let me see your envelope.
[00:22:27.585 --> 00:22:28.846]  I'll show you what gate we go to.
[00:22:28.926 --> 00:22:30.147]  I pointed them in the right direction.
[00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:33.562]  Thank you, thank you, appreciate it.
[00:22:33.582 --> 00:22:35.343]  God bless you guys.
[00:22:35.363 --> 00:22:36.244]  God bless.
[00:22:36.264 --> 00:22:38.845]  This is your flight right here.
[00:22:38.885 --> 00:22:40.486]  You're going to Las Vegas.
[00:22:40.506 --> 00:22:41.547]  Yeah right here.
[00:22:41.587 --> 00:22:42.047]  Not only
[00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:47.811]  Did we have this family?
[00:22:48.491 --> 00:22:50.673]  But I believe we found two other envelopes, correct?
[00:22:50.893 --> 00:22:52.034]  Two of the three.
[00:22:52.054 --> 00:22:52.434]  Yes.
[00:22:52.474 --> 00:22:55.896]  So this is the last flight out of McAllen into Las Vegas.
[00:22:55.936 --> 00:22:57.577]  We got into the airport last minute.
[00:22:57.597 --> 00:22:58.618]  This is a buzzer beater shot.
[00:22:59.058 --> 00:23:07.604]  And we found three envelopes, just as described in the story from News Wars, with numbers, flights, information, everything on it.
[00:23:08.982 --> 00:23:12.808]  And so it appears that these people are actually maybe heading towards Salt Lake.
[00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:16.934]  And so that's where they're going to Vegas and then tomorrow to Salt Lake.
[00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:22.624]  And again, they couldn't speak English, it was a family of four, and they're coming in.
[00:23:22.745 --> 00:23:23.786]  Something's in that envelope.
[00:23:24.506 --> 00:23:26.008]  They seemed lost, quite frankly.
[00:23:26.068 --> 00:23:30.212]  And we were wondering, because they were kind of looking around suspiciously, we were like, oh, are they onto us, trying to hide the envelope?
[00:23:30.552 --> 00:23:31.413]  No, they're just lost.
[00:23:31.953 --> 00:23:33.515]  They just didn't know what they were doing.
[00:23:34.136 --> 00:23:39.201]  Because they're in a foreign country, they don't speak the language, and all they have is this envelope with who knows what in it.
[00:23:39.941 --> 00:23:46.264]  All right, more of the report, held 20 minutes of it, is up at Bandot Video in the Owen Schroer section and at Infowars.com.
[00:23:46.284 --> 00:23:57.710]  And the big story that I just mentioned to you, exclusive footage of the illegal aliens being dumped right into the United States and then put on airplanes illegally to be flown around.
[00:23:57.990 --> 00:24:00.411]  You are listening to a Frontline Report.
[00:24:00.711 --> 00:24:04.833]  We're broadcasting worldwide on this Tuesday, March 30th, 2021.
[00:24:04.873 --> 00:24:08.215]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and I am at Total
[00:24:09.699 --> 00:24:12.541]  Information Overlook.
[00:24:14.182 --> 00:24:16.904]  Our team down on the Texas-Mexico border at the U.N.
[00:24:16.964 --> 00:24:32.236]  invasion site is just knocking these reports in hoverboats on the river, on the Rio Grande out of the park, drones over giant sprawling facilities that hold 20,000 people, with dozens of other huge facilities overflowing, stacked with children.
[00:24:32.616 --> 00:24:34.958]  This is probably 10 times the biggest invasion ever.
[00:24:35.778 --> 00:24:54.635]  Airports just swollen with masses of people with envelopes of cash being flown to God knows where with no ID, all the law being waived illegally, the FBI saying no background checks needed to fly, no background checks needed where they're going, men with little babies, men with two or three kids with them.
[00:24:55.816 --> 00:24:57.598]  It's just totally insane.
[00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:02.501]  Oh, but they want to put up checkpoints when you go to the mall.
[00:25:02.741 --> 00:25:06.382]  They want you to have that vaccine before you can go to a sports stadium and have a job.
[00:25:06.402 --> 00:25:09.923]  And I'm going to be covering that here in just a moment.
[00:25:09.983 --> 00:25:18.685]  But this article, exclusive video, illegal immigrants with envelopes of cash seen at an airport flying around the U.S.
[00:25:18.705 --> 00:25:21.886]  And I didn't play the full 17 minute report.
[00:25:21.906 --> 00:25:23.786]  I mean, he interviews the people, he talks to them.
[00:25:24.147 --> 00:25:26.207]  They're being nice, not sticking cameras in their faces.
[00:25:26.247 --> 00:25:29.108]  But we show the families, we show the people, we show the children.
[00:25:30.956 --> 00:25:38.069]  And everybody should just go to that particular airport right there that we just listed where it's at.
[00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:40.674]  Everybody should go see it for yourself!
[00:25:41.823 --> 00:25:44.685]  See, the buses pull up, the people get on, they go through the line.
[00:25:45.186 --> 00:25:48.869]  Oh, but when you're going through the line, you got to have an ID, because you're a slave.
[00:25:49.489 --> 00:25:53.712]  You can be white, you can be black, you can be Hispanic, you can be Asian, you're going to show that ID.
[00:25:54.373 --> 00:25:59.957]  But they want these people to exploit, to control, and to be a permanent underclass, and to vote for them.
[00:26:00.257 --> 00:26:02.839]  Who they got to vote for when they're disappearing in the Democratic Party?
[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:10.626]  And all their NGOs, and all their refugee organizations, all these churches, and all these Catholic churches, and all these synagogues, whose main business
[00:26:11.266 --> 00:26:12.166]  It's refugee centers.
[00:26:12.406 --> 00:26:14.407]  Nobody's going to the synagogue or the church anymore.
[00:26:14.887 --> 00:26:26.130]  They've got big dormitories full of people that they're bringing in, like the shooter that went and killed 10 white people in Boulder so Obama could say it was a white supremacist when he killed them because they were white.
[00:26:27.631 --> 00:26:28.791]  And he loved Joe Biden.
[00:26:28.871 --> 00:26:30.291]  He loved Biden and Obama.
[00:26:30.331 --> 00:26:31.412]  He hated Donald Trump.
[00:26:31.432 --> 00:26:32.652]  He hated Alex Jones.
[00:26:32.692 --> 00:26:33.832]  He hated America.
[00:26:35.293 --> 00:26:36.853]  Another rattlesnake brought in.
[00:26:37.133 --> 00:26:38.774]  Now, are these women and children rattlesnakes?
[00:26:38.814 --> 00:26:38.914]  No.
[00:26:39.773 --> 00:26:40.857]  But they're totally controlled.
[00:26:41.318 --> 00:26:42.362]  They'll be put on welfare.
[00:26:42.823 --> 00:26:44.650]  They'll be skimmed off the top of the blue cities.
[00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:46.436]  It's like in the middle of all these...
[00:26:48.004 --> 00:26:49.385]  Fentanyl areas.
[00:26:50.185 --> 00:26:53.186]  All the drug addicts in the skid rows that are everywhere across the country now.
[00:26:53.446 --> 00:26:54.506]  Democrats legalize it.
[00:26:54.807 --> 00:26:55.687]  The drugs are shipped in.
[00:26:55.707 --> 00:27:03.170]  You'll have high-rise buildings right in the middle of it full of social workers that go and milk the money off all the mentally ill drug addicts.
[00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:05.250]  And then clean their dead bodies up later.
[00:27:05.591 --> 00:27:06.151]  Bring in more.
[00:27:06.171 --> 00:27:06.851]  Get them addicted.
[00:27:07.411 --> 00:27:09.072]  Get the majority of their welfare.
[00:27:09.372 --> 00:27:10.833]  Oh, their favorite's a disabled vet.
[00:27:11.093 --> 00:27:13.373]  They'll get upwards of half their disabled check.
[00:27:13.854 --> 00:27:17.015]  Make sure the drug dealers and big Escalades are there selling it to them right there.
[00:27:18.049 --> 00:27:26.252]  The police are told don't do anything and they're there just milking the milk cow as people are laid out on the ground.
[00:27:26.712 --> 00:27:32.955]  And then when one dies like George Floyd, now it turns out three times the fentanyl on his body to kill a man.
[00:27:32.975 --> 00:27:36.936]  He had fentanyl in his mouth, he was trying to hide it.
[00:27:38.197 --> 00:27:43.399]  He'd have been totally dead if he was able to bite into those, but it didn't matter because you need to burn America!
[00:27:44.397 --> 00:27:48.178]  And the media is totally blocking the fact that's coming out in the trial right now.
[00:27:49.179 --> 00:27:56.301]  Because if you're gonna kill black people all over the world, do secret experimentation on them, you gotta pose and act like you actually care about them with Black Lives Matter.
[00:27:57.341 --> 00:27:58.482]  It doesn't want a black family.
[00:27:59.932 --> 00:28:02.974]  Somebody always wants to help you when they don't want you to have a father in the home, right?
[00:28:02.994 --> 00:28:03.595]  They're good people.
[00:28:04.015 --> 00:28:06.737]  And their number one mission is to help black men become trans.
[00:28:07.238 --> 00:28:08.018]  We're here to help you.
[00:28:08.058 --> 00:28:10.540]  We don't want you to have a family, and we want your testicles.
[00:28:11.181 --> 00:28:12.202]  Sounds like Aliensland.
[00:28:12.702 --> 00:28:14.103]  We are demanding your testicles.
[00:28:14.924 --> 00:28:17.986]  By the way, it's in the news that there will be no fertility in men by 2045.
[00:28:18.046 --> 00:28:24.091]  The UN is celebrating it, and I'm going to cover those articles when we come back next segment.
[00:28:24.111 --> 00:28:25.272]  But I wanted to air this because
[00:28:26.684 --> 00:28:28.928]  This is CNN doing their whitewash.
[00:28:28.968 --> 00:28:35.458]  The headline I saw this morning was, it's not just Tuskegee why blacks don't want to take the vaccines.
[00:28:36.099 --> 00:28:38.003]  It's the racism in medicine.
[00:28:38.403 --> 00:28:39.926]  So they're trying to change the subject.
[00:28:39.946 --> 00:28:40.787]  Let me give you a little newsflash.
[00:28:41.604 --> 00:28:44.287]  They didn't just give the poor black people the syphilis.
[00:28:44.307 --> 00:28:45.788]  They did it to every poor group they could.
[00:28:46.188 --> 00:28:51.193]  All over the world, in Eastern Europe, and in Central America, and in South America.
[00:28:51.594 --> 00:28:52.855]  It's all been declassified.
[00:28:53.035 --> 00:28:56.999]  They took poor white kids and radiated them to death in radiation experiments.
[00:28:57.039 --> 00:28:59.762]  And Jewish children in Israel called the ringworm children.
[00:28:59.782 --> 00:29:00.482]  Many were killed.
[00:29:01.465 --> 00:29:03.585]  That was the Jews doing that to him under a U.S.
[00:29:03.605 --> 00:29:04.926]  Department of Energy operation.
[00:29:05.206 --> 00:29:07.266]  It's to test and see what scientists will do.
[00:29:07.546 --> 00:29:12.507]  So it isn't about what color you are, it's about being disadvantaged and the global is coming after you.
[00:29:12.867 --> 00:29:17.208]  And so it doesn't matter if it's a white child or a black child, they're just as valuable in God's eyes.
[00:29:17.468 --> 00:29:19.648]  And when we allow this, it's on us, as Christ said.
[00:29:20.848 --> 00:29:27.930]  So here's part of CNN's whitewash, having to address why those black people that we love so much just don't trust us.
[00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:28.870]  Why is that?
[00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:29.290]  Here it is.
[00:29:32.096 --> 00:29:33.037]  I do believe in COVID.
[00:29:33.217 --> 00:29:33.938]  Yes, yes.
[00:29:34.479 --> 00:29:43.991]  At Playmaker's Barbershop in Atlanta, the tight fades are blended with energetic and sometimes loud discussions about who's the greatest basketball player of all time.
[00:29:44.531 --> 00:29:46.454]  My name was Giannis before the basketball player.
[00:29:48.510 --> 00:29:54.275]  But now COVID-19 stimulus checks and the COVID vaccines are talked about just as passionately.
[00:29:54.875 --> 00:29:59.499]  I really don't trust it because it actually came kind of fast.
[00:30:00.019 --> 00:30:07.005]  Barber Yannis Willis feels strongly that the development of COVID-19 vaccines was rushed and comes with serious side effects.
[00:30:07.526 --> 00:30:11.169]  People that take it, they have bell palsy.
[00:30:11.749 --> 00:30:14.812]  Outside the shop, James Harris had other concerns.
[00:30:15.392 --> 00:30:17.154]  I know the doctor took it and killed him.
[00:30:18.007 --> 00:30:20.069]  And this nurse I know live here, she killed her.
[00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:36.008]  While the CDC and FDA are looking into those and similar claims around the country, Harrison-Willis police underscore a serious concern for Fulton County Health Director Lynn Paxton and her team, who are fighting the misinformation online about as hard as they're battling the virus itself.
[00:30:36.499 --> 00:30:41.322]  This vaccine is very effective and very safe.
[00:30:41.742 --> 00:30:55.329]  But it's not easy, especially when rumors spread on social media, like posts claiming baseball legend Hank Aaron died from the vaccine because he received his dose publicly days before passing away.
[00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:56.590]  He didn't.
[00:30:56.990 --> 00:31:00.312]  The Fulton County Medical Examiner says he died from natural causes.
[00:31:00.832 --> 00:31:05.955]  But many in Atlanta's black community believe the claim, forcing health officials to speak out.
[00:31:06.311 --> 00:31:09.773]  I think it's just important that we quell these kind of rumors.
[00:31:10.153 --> 00:31:14.295]  Which is why Paxton's team is now distributing information in these communities.
[00:31:14.916 --> 00:31:18.538]  Seek out trusted sources for information about the vaccine.
[00:31:19.338 --> 00:31:24.941]  Facebook and your neighbor next door's postings are not trusted sources.
[00:31:25.442 --> 00:31:31.365]  Health officials worry misinformation could complicate the process of getting shots in the arms of black and brown communities.
[00:31:31.985 --> 00:31:34.687]  New CDC data from the first month of vaccination.
[00:31:35.507 --> 00:31:36.608]  Here's the latest data.
[00:31:37.088 --> 00:31:39.309]  Think about 1 out of 10 to 1 out of 100 reported.
[00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:42.651]  4,000 plus people dead from the vaccines in Europe.
[00:31:43.171 --> 00:31:44.032]  Thousands dead here.
[00:31:44.052 --> 00:31:45.192]  They're trying to suppress the numbers.
[00:31:45.813 --> 00:31:46.793]  And guess what happened?
[00:31:46.833 --> 00:31:47.814]  Robert Kennedy Jr.
[00:31:49.335 --> 00:31:51.216]  called the family and called the medical examiner.
[00:31:51.376 --> 00:31:53.197]  Hank Aaron had no medical exam done.
[00:31:54.117 --> 00:31:54.798]  That's a Snopes.
[00:31:55.805 --> 00:31:56.805]  Lie, and guess what?
[00:31:56.865 --> 00:32:08.830]  We're going to have that article today, and I'm going to do a report on CNN, and I'm going to show all the numbers of dead, all the adverse reactions, all the admissions, the fact that it's not an approved vaccine, and I'm going to show marvelous Marvin Hagler!
[00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:17.433]  One day after he took the second dose, his organs liquefied, and then I'm going to show a bunch of white people died after they took it.
[00:32:18.233 --> 00:32:20.914]  But there they are, lying to you.
[00:32:22.369 --> 00:32:28.673]  Robert F. Kennedy wrote like a 20-page article, we posted it a month ago, where he called, quoted the family, quoted everybody.
[00:32:31.555 --> 00:32:36.779]  And they said no, there was no autopsy, no medical examiner, and the medical examiner said we did not issue a finding.
[00:32:40.061 --> 00:32:41.902]  But they tell you that same lie.
[00:32:42.483 --> 00:32:48.887]  CNN, that's why they want us off the air, ladies and gentlemen, because we're going to call them on their crap.
[00:32:50.458 --> 00:32:52.984]  I will shoot a report at the end of the show documenting all of that.
[00:32:53.004 --> 00:32:54.608]  That'll be up at Band-Aid video by this evening.
[00:32:55.882 --> 00:32:58.583]  And I don't care whether somebody's black or whether there's white, you share it with them.
[00:32:58.883 --> 00:33:00.824]  I went and got my hair cut yesterday.
[00:33:01.404 --> 00:33:07.566]  The barbershop just so happens to be pretty much half black now, more than half black, where my grandfather used to get his hair cut.
[00:33:08.146 --> 00:33:09.987]  And it's mainly a black and Hispanic area.
[00:33:10.007 --> 00:33:11.267]  That's where I still go sometimes.
[00:33:11.767 --> 00:33:12.247]  And guess what?
[00:33:12.287 --> 00:33:13.168]  They were all listeners.
[00:33:13.188 --> 00:33:15.448]  There were two black guys, a Hispanic and a white guy.
[00:33:15.468 --> 00:33:17.309]  They were all listeners and don't take the vaccine.
[00:33:17.529 --> 00:33:18.809]  You're screwed, New World Order!
[00:33:19.009 --> 00:33:19.790]  You're screwed!
[00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:20.710]  You're screwed!
[00:33:20.890 --> 00:33:21.650]  You're screwed!
[00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:22.511]  You're screwed!
[00:33:22.691 --> 00:33:23.411]  You're screwed!
[00:33:24.676 --> 00:33:30.541]  If you just joined us, or you're a new listener, and you're like, man, this guy gets upset.
[00:33:30.581 --> 00:33:31.602]  This guy talks fast.
[00:33:32.242 --> 00:33:33.203]  I don't do that in private.
[00:33:33.363 --> 00:33:34.684]  At home, I'm pretty laid back.
[00:33:34.704 --> 00:33:35.905]  With my friends, I'm pretty laid back.
[00:33:37.266 --> 00:33:38.667]  But here on the air, I'm in a war.
[00:33:38.687 --> 00:33:40.589]  I mean, I'm not doing this to lose.
[00:33:41.409 --> 00:33:42.770]  The enemy's trying to shut us down.
[00:33:42.790 --> 00:33:44.492]  They're trying to destroy us everywhere right now.
[00:33:45.509 --> 00:33:53.732]  And they are doing things that are illegal, that are criminal, that are destructive, that are exploitive, that are absolutely the most tyrannical crap you could imagine.
[00:33:53.853 --> 00:34:00.896]  And it's only going to get worse under this post-human designed end of the world as we know it.
[00:34:01.856 --> 00:34:04.017]  End of civilization, a post-human world.
[00:34:05.162 --> 00:34:06.363]  And I see the media making jokes.
[00:34:06.443 --> 00:34:08.264]  Oh, Jones says the world ends in 2030.
[00:34:08.964 --> 00:34:13.967]  No, you say the post-human world will be basically beginning to be over by 2030.
[00:34:14.328 --> 00:34:18.250]  I've got a stack of articles where you say it just today.
[00:34:20.011 --> 00:34:27.356]  So don't pretend you're not a damn crazy death cult with a bunch of weird academics pretending like they're going to be part of the small group that lives.
[00:34:28.544 --> 00:34:31.028]  The public plan of the UN is a 90% reduction.
[00:34:31.689 --> 00:34:32.971]  A lot of the internal docs have leaked.
[00:34:32.991 --> 00:34:35.515]  They're talking about less than 1% of humans left.
[00:34:37.558 --> 00:34:38.319]  And that's their plan.
[00:34:38.599 --> 00:34:39.661]  Ray Kurzweil, all of them.
[00:34:42.284 --> 00:34:58.508]  And so when you're like one of the Google owners, or one of the Rothschilds, or the Facebook people, I mean, you literally think of everybody else as animals, and they want us out of the way, and they see us as destructive, and they fly over these big ugly cities, and they go, look at all those ugly people, and they want your ass dead!
[00:35:02.729 --> 00:35:08.511]  And my argument's this, I mean, if you know all this and you don't care to stand up for yourself, you deserve to die.
[00:35:09.653 --> 00:35:12.395]  But the globalists are not in a position to be the ones to carry it out.
[00:35:13.115 --> 00:35:18.860]  Vengeance is mine, said the Lord, and they're some of the worst people on the planet, so they should be the first to go.
[00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:31.789]  When I start seeing Bill Gates and the Rothschilds and all these people hanging themselves, when I start seeing them blow their own brains out on national TV and say, there's too many of us, then I'll give them some respect.
[00:35:32.129 --> 00:35:33.810]  But no, no, no, no, no.
[00:35:34.111 --> 00:35:35.752]  They want the Earth for themselves.
[00:35:38.086 --> 00:35:39.067]  So grow up, people!
[00:35:39.948 --> 00:35:41.889]  This isn't Alex Jones being shocking.
[00:35:43.771 --> 00:35:49.836]  This is the reality of the world, and any of you pretending you're part of the power structure, pretending you're going to be getting out of this, think again.
[00:35:49.856 --> 00:35:53.859]  Now, I'm going to hit this big story now, but first, listen.
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:36:04.548]  This article, exclusive video, illegal immigrants with envelopes of cash seen at airports flying around the United States illegally.
[00:36:04.888 --> 00:36:07.030]  I've had them add the word illegal to the article.
[00:36:11.513 --> 00:36:12.394]  This is the video.
[00:36:12.414 --> 00:36:14.235]  This is not just a few photos on Twitter.
[00:36:14.275 --> 00:36:14.956]  This is the video.
[00:36:14.976 --> 00:36:17.899]  This is the people being interviewed.
[00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:22.002]  So get that article and get it out to everyone you know.
[00:36:22.162 --> 00:36:24.704]  Then, think about that CNN report we just aired.
[00:36:24.764 --> 00:36:26.666]  I'm going to do a whole piece today with a whole report.
[00:36:26.966 --> 00:36:29.569]  I'm going to debunk the whole damn thing.
[00:36:30.728 --> 00:36:31.468]  Look at this article.
[00:36:31.548 --> 00:36:33.649]  National media pushes vaccine misinformation.
[00:36:34.049 --> 00:36:36.490]  Coroner's office never saw Hank Aaron's body.
[00:36:36.770 --> 00:36:38.071]  He talked to the coroner's office.
[00:36:38.331 --> 00:36:39.311]  He talked to everybody.
[00:36:39.691 --> 00:36:40.431]  He put it out.
[00:36:40.751 --> 00:36:43.732]  He put the interviews out and got banned off Instagram and Facebook.
[00:36:44.073 --> 00:36:45.293]  Robert Kennedy Jr.
[00:36:45.513 --> 00:36:46.333]  for telling the truth.
[00:36:46.633 --> 00:36:52.956]  So CNN could lie to you and tell you none of this is going on.
[00:36:53.176 --> 00:36:53.676]  Incredible.
[00:36:57.418 --> 00:37:07.646]  Now let me show you this, then I'll hit that article I mentioned, where AP and others are saying, yes, it's about carbon, yes, humans are evil, yes, you should never be able to leave your house again.
[00:37:07.686 --> 00:37:09.007]  But first, let me just show you this.
[00:37:12.350 --> 00:37:18.795]  Because this is extremely, extremely important.
[00:37:21.017 --> 00:37:22.378]  It's very simple, but it's very important.
[00:37:22.398 --> 00:37:24.460]  Look at this headline, gatewaypundit.com.
[00:37:25.643 --> 00:37:32.989]  President Trump launches new website, www.45, the number 45, office.com.
[00:37:35.251 --> 00:37:51.625]  And that's great, because everyone has to get back to the future, back to your own URLs, back to your own video and audio streaming, back to the diversification of the internet and the freedom of the internet, instead of letting these big five monsters gobble it all up and control us, and they're buying up almost all the other companies right now.
[00:37:52.666 --> 00:37:56.148]  All the little sub-companies we were using to still stay online, they're buying them all.
[00:37:56.808 --> 00:38:05.672]  So we're literally like dancing and running across a lava, a river of lava, jumping from stone to stone, and after we jump to each stone, the last stone is disappearing.
[00:38:07.353 --> 00:38:08.533]  That's how crazy this is.
[00:38:08.973 --> 00:38:09.414]  Look at this.
[00:38:10.934 --> 00:38:14.616]  Amazon is still supporting and collecting commission from Alex Jones storefront.
[00:38:14.956 --> 00:38:15.536]  Shut it down.
[00:38:15.596 --> 00:38:16.877]  Business Insider yesterday.
[00:38:19.418 --> 00:38:21.099]  Before that, Alex Jones.
[00:38:23.365 --> 00:38:25.446]  Is calling for violence, take him off the internet.
[00:38:26.567 --> 00:38:28.088]  News Times, totally not true.
[00:38:29.629 --> 00:38:34.193]  Alex Jones still sells supplements on Amazon despite ban from other platforms.
[00:38:34.593 --> 00:38:35.153]  NPR.
[00:38:36.214 --> 00:38:37.455]  And it's in the New York Times.
[00:38:39.596 --> 00:38:40.377]  It's in everything.
[00:38:41.656 --> 00:38:55.204]  And Glenn Greenwald has an article about USA Today doing big articles on making sure they list everywhere that people arrested at the Capitol are and how they're raising money for their defense and hoping their family members lose their jobs, which they are, and then committing suicide.
[00:38:55.464 --> 00:39:11.213]  And USA Today, this big giant, second biggest paper in the U.S., is bullying people, exposing where they live, getting them fired, doxing them, and then when people criticize USA Today, they call themselves a victim.
[00:39:12.130 --> 00:39:16.954]  So if an aunt says something to Tyrannosaurus Rex, it's a bully, while it's being attacked.
[00:39:16.994 --> 00:39:18.955]  If you defend yourself, you're a terrorist.
[00:39:18.975 --> 00:39:20.236]  Look at this article.
[00:39:22.317 --> 00:39:23.018]  Out of News Times.
[00:39:23.178 --> 00:39:28.242]  Alex Jones argues blood on the streets rant against attorney of Newtown families was protected free speech.
[00:39:28.522 --> 00:39:30.063]  They just put all this out of context.
[00:39:30.163 --> 00:39:31.364]  I didn't say that about that attorney.
[00:39:33.346 --> 00:39:35.607]  I said that about whoever tried to plant child porn on us.
[00:39:35.847 --> 00:39:37.609]  The FBI confirmed that somebody tried to plant it on us.
[00:39:37.809 --> 00:39:40.551]  They just lie saying I said that when I never said that.
[00:39:44.144 --> 00:39:46.865]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, that's how the deception works.
[00:39:47.265 --> 00:39:51.566]  And they say that somebody's being violent, so they've got to be silenced when it's the globalists that are violent.
[00:39:51.766 --> 00:39:53.446]  The globalists run in death camps in China.
[00:39:54.546 --> 00:39:54.866]  All of it.
[00:39:57.607 --> 00:39:59.467]  And it goes on and on and on.
[00:39:59.587 --> 00:40:00.747]  So I'm going to say it again.
[00:40:02.708 --> 00:40:05.928]  We are barely on air and fighting as hard as we can.
[00:40:06.289 --> 00:40:07.949]  Thank God for our radio affiliates.
[00:40:08.863 --> 00:40:11.525]  Our TV affiliates, they're all getting incredible ratings having us on.
[00:40:11.765 --> 00:40:12.665]  People want the truth.
[00:40:12.926 --> 00:40:14.026]  The truth is very popular.
[00:40:14.046 --> 00:40:19.210]  I mean, I don't want to say it, but if they put me on Fox News, I'd have the ratings of Tucker Carlson, just like that.
[00:40:19.310 --> 00:40:19.770]  Tucker knows it.
[00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:20.230]  Everybody knows it.
[00:40:20.350 --> 00:40:21.331]  It's not about competition.
[00:40:21.511 --> 00:40:23.632]  It's about the truth being popular, as Tucker has said.
[00:40:25.554 --> 00:40:26.975]  They're trying to take Tucker off as well.
[00:40:27.755 --> 00:40:29.956]  So I need financial support, and I've got items.
[00:40:30.477 --> 00:40:31.838]  I've got products you already need.
[00:40:32.238 --> 00:40:33.639]  The store-wide free shipping.
[00:40:34.864 --> 00:40:40.026]  Had to end a week ago, but I did free shipping on select items, a whole bunch of them.
[00:40:40.546 --> 00:40:56.593]  All the Dr. Jones Naturals, all of the Emrix Essentials, the body wash, the shampoo, the 15 essential oils, the three essential oil hand sanitizers that are amazing, the charcoal, activated charcoal toothpaste, the mouthwash, the deodorant.
[00:40:56.653 --> 00:41:02.276]  It's all 50% off with free shipping and all the iodine products, X2, X3.
[00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:06.151]  All the time I forget to take my own supplements.
[00:41:06.652 --> 00:41:08.633]  And I'm like, wait a minute, it's been two weeks since I took X2.
[00:41:08.653 --> 00:41:16.219]  Started taking X2 a couple days ago, already felt the energy, the clarity, a little bit of brain fog I had from being exhausted and stressed out, just disappeared.
[00:41:16.599 --> 00:41:17.400]  It's the good halogen.
[00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:20.843]  It's needed for electrochemical activity in the entire body, especially the brain.
[00:41:21.363 --> 00:41:24.285]  And it just so happens in your organs, like your sexual organs.
[00:41:24.666 --> 00:41:26.287]  So it's so good for your skin, everything.
[00:41:26.727 --> 00:41:29.629]  X2, X3, two different combinations, both very important.
[00:41:29.929 --> 00:41:35.651]  Deep Earth Crystal, Iodine, X2, X3, Deep Earth Crystal, Iodine, and two other types of Iodine for better absorption.
[00:41:35.671 --> 00:41:37.712]  For some people, it varies your physiology.
[00:41:37.732 --> 00:41:38.553]  You've got to try them both.
[00:41:38.853 --> 00:41:41.494]  This is powerful stuff, so check it out.
[00:41:41.734 --> 00:41:42.495]  Consult your physician.
[00:41:43.834 --> 00:41:50.338]  Those are 50% off free shipping and the surface spray, the strongest out there, not for ingestion.
[00:41:50.678 --> 00:41:51.438]  That's 50% off.
[00:41:51.518 --> 00:41:55.801]  And then an X2 via spray bottle so you get better aerosolization in your mouth.
[00:41:56.401 --> 00:41:57.782]  That is 50% off as well.
[00:41:58.022 --> 00:42:00.463]  That has to end Thursday morning.
[00:42:00.524 --> 00:42:04.466]  It will end because a bunch of the items like Vaso Beats, Alpha Power, Prostagard sold out.
[00:42:04.986 --> 00:42:09.070]  We also have Brain Force Plus, our best-selling newsrobics, sold out for three months, back in stock.
[00:42:09.210 --> 00:42:10.932]  It is 50% off with free shipping.
[00:42:11.232 --> 00:42:13.414]  That's going to have to end as well.
[00:42:13.835 --> 00:42:16.557]  So, the big mega blowout has to end very soon.
[00:42:16.938 --> 00:42:24.205]  Hope you take advantage of it right now, but whatever you do, please pray for the broadcast and please spread the word because we are fighting as hard as we can.
[00:42:24.225 --> 00:42:26.207]  We are swinging for the damn fences here.
[00:42:27.352 --> 00:42:30.553]  And as it becomes evident this isn't a game or a joke, people are going to figure it out.
[00:42:30.714 --> 00:42:32.194]  Total censorship online.
[00:42:32.574 --> 00:42:34.095]  Censorship sitting talk radio.
[00:42:34.235 --> 00:42:35.476]  Everything's starting to shut down.
[00:42:35.996 --> 00:42:37.177]  Total economic warfare.
[00:42:37.217 --> 00:42:38.477]  The bullies are winning.
[00:42:38.957 --> 00:42:42.379]  They're just bulldozing over things, but the resistance is forming.
[00:42:42.679 --> 00:42:49.020]  And historically resistance forms later after the bullying and we're starting to see the seed sprout and a huge resistance form.
[00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:52.561]  That's why the enemy's moving so quick to try to bully and silence everyone.
[00:42:52.601 --> 00:42:55.821]  Well, as for us, we're not going to get on our knees and live as slaves.
[00:42:56.102 --> 00:43:05.403]  We're going to stand on our hind legs and fight and win or die trying because it's better to fight on our feet in the information war than to live on our knees as slaves.
[00:43:06.123 --> 00:43:08.444]  To quote Zapata, the Mexican revolutionary.
[00:43:09.392 --> 00:43:12.374]  So, we're going to keep fighting here, keep fighting strong.
[00:43:12.654 --> 00:43:17.138]  I got to most of the news I wanted to hit this hour, but I didn't get to the big article that I'll hit as soon as we start the next hour.
[00:43:17.538 --> 00:43:20.460]  Dear Normal AP says, it's time to go away.
[00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:25.644]  We all need to stay in our homes, for the earth, and only leave when authorized, and have robots deliver our food.
[00:43:26.064 --> 00:43:29.006]  It's the takeover plan, writ large, I have all the backup articles.
[00:43:29.366 --> 00:43:30.727]  This is next level evil.
[00:43:30.988 --> 00:43:32.429]  The enemy is taking the mask off.
[00:43:32.709 --> 00:43:33.950]  That is hour number two.
[00:43:34.030 --> 00:43:34.870]  So what are we going to do?
[00:43:35.811 --> 00:43:42.118]  Hit your email, hit your text messages, hit your Facebook, your Twitter, and say, here's the forbidden link to the show.
[00:43:42.158 --> 00:43:43.300]  They're not banning the link yet.
[00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:45.202]  It's banthis.tv.
[00:43:45.462 --> 00:43:45.883]  We'll be back.
[00:43:51.118 --> 00:43:55.782]  I would in fact make sure that there is, we immediately surge to the border.
[00:43:56.162 --> 00:43:57.763]  All those people are seeking asylum.
[00:43:58.064 --> 00:43:59.024]  They deserve to be heard.
[00:43:59.044 --> 00:43:59.905]  That's who we are.
[00:44:00.245 --> 00:44:04.128]  We're a nation that says if you want to flee, and you're fleeing oppression, you should come.
[00:44:04.389 --> 00:44:08.872]  Hundreds of thousands of people a week, not a month, are pouring across.
[00:44:08.932 --> 00:44:12.615]  That's what our border patrol sources are telling us right now.
[00:44:13.116 --> 00:44:17.199]  Upwards of half of them are children under the age of 15, many as young as two.
[00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:21.062]  Unaccompanied and in many cases kidnapped.
[00:44:21.543 --> 00:44:23.585]  Some of these children have not seen the sun in days.
[00:44:24.366 --> 00:44:25.247]  What's your reaction?
[00:44:25.788 --> 00:44:29.912]  What is your reaction to these images that have come out from that particular facility?
[00:44:30.453 --> 00:44:33.356]  Is what's happening inside acceptable to you?
[00:44:33.816 --> 00:44:35.198]  And when is this going to be fixed?
[00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:37.662]  Is that a serious question, right?
[00:44:38.543 --> 00:44:39.364]  Yeah, he triggered it!
[00:44:39.544 --> 00:44:40.225]  He said do it!
[00:44:40.285 --> 00:44:45.332]  What some are calling a new humanitarian crisis is quickly unfolding at the southern border.
[00:44:45.372 --> 00:44:50.759]  Homeland Security still reporting a big uptick in migrant crossings including a major spike in unaccompanied
[00:44:50.759 --> 00:44:52.019]  Everything you see in the media is crap.
[00:44:52.039 --> 00:44:52.479]  It's over 100% full.
[00:45:14.713 --> 00:45:16.894]  They're releasing them on average every seven hours.
[00:45:16.914 --> 00:45:20.616]  They're just gorging it, flooding it, loading them on buses, loading them on airports.
[00:45:21.537 --> 00:45:22.537]  It's complete evil.
[00:45:22.717 --> 00:45:23.758]  Okay, let's continue with the report.
[00:45:25.259 --> 00:45:30.284]  You're getting more information from Mexico about what's happening at our southern border than you are from the White House?
[00:45:30.384 --> 00:45:31.305]  Is that still the case?
[00:45:50.822 --> 00:45:51.643]  It's still the case.
[00:45:52.123 --> 00:45:52.784]  Hey, remember.
[00:45:52.944 --> 00:45:54.225]  You know, very straightforward.
[00:45:54.305 --> 00:45:55.025]  I'm a Democrat.
[00:45:55.406 --> 00:45:57.187]  The administration's a Democrat.
[00:45:58.348 --> 00:46:00.850]  And basically, I mean, that's the truth.
[00:46:00.930 --> 00:46:05.394]  I mean, I got contacts in Mexico and in Central America.
[00:46:05.834 --> 00:46:08.176]  I know what messages are being heard over there.
[00:46:08.997 --> 00:46:12.700]  And there's two messages are being over there that are being heard over there.
[00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:17.644]  So, yes, it's a messaging and getting information from my friends in Mexico.
[00:46:18.044 --> 00:46:28.752]  Senator Ted Cruz valiantly has gone to the facilities and is confronted by a leftist high level appointee of Biden saying that he's treating the children badly by showing what's happening to them.
[00:46:29.052 --> 00:46:34.056]  And it is incredible squalor, worse than a third world prison, way beyond what Obama did.
[00:46:34.076 --> 00:46:35.517]  And of course, Trump cleaned it up.
[00:46:35.757 --> 00:46:37.058]  Please give dignity to the people.
[00:46:37.198 --> 00:46:38.560]  Please give dignity to the people.
[00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:44.785]  So you work for the commissioner, your senior advisor, you were hired two weeks ago, and you're instructed to ask us to not have any pictures taken here.
[00:46:44.805 --> 00:46:45.866]  Please respect the people, the rules.
[00:46:45.886 --> 00:46:49.609]  Because the political leadership at DHS does not want the American people to know it.
[00:46:49.629 --> 00:46:50.650]  Please respect the rules, sir.
[00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:52.351]  You keep standing in front of the pictures.
[00:46:52.391 --> 00:46:52.972]  Please respect the rules.
[00:46:52.992 --> 00:46:54.133]  So you don't want the pictures taken.
[00:46:54.153 --> 00:46:56.595]  The rules are arbitrary and they're designed to keep the American people in the dark.
[00:46:56.615 --> 00:46:58.517]  Please respect the rules and give the people dignity and respect.
[00:46:58.997 --> 00:46:59.677]  That's all we ask.
[00:46:59.817 --> 00:47:00.558]  Dignity and respect.
[00:47:00.578 --> 00:47:02.619]  You're asking, is this dignity and respect?
[00:47:02.639 --> 00:47:04.940]  Please give dignity and respect to the people.
[00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:06.621]  Let me ask you, there's a pandemic.
[00:47:06.701 --> 00:47:08.001]  I respectfully ask you, sir.
[00:47:08.221 --> 00:47:11.583]  There is a pandemic, is this respecting the rights of these kids?
[00:47:11.903 --> 00:47:13.284]  Are you respecting the rights of these kids?
[00:47:13.304 --> 00:47:14.244]  This is not a zoo, sir.
[00:47:14.264 --> 00:47:15.445]  Please don't treat the people as such.
[00:47:15.465 --> 00:47:18.286]  You're right, and this is a dangerous place.
[00:47:18.386 --> 00:47:19.806]  Please don't treat the people like this.
[00:47:19.847 --> 00:47:21.207]  That's all I ask for you, sir.
[00:47:25.690 --> 00:47:29.433]  We are so politically correct.
[00:47:29.473 --> 00:47:30.994]  We have no defense mechanism.
[00:47:31.114 --> 00:47:33.156]  We have no territorialism.
[00:47:33.196 --> 00:47:34.136]  We have no culture.
[00:47:34.176 --> 00:47:38.940]  We are just an overrun joke for the UN, the Chinese, the third world.
[00:47:39.501 --> 00:47:42.123]  And I mean, that's it.
[00:47:43.364 --> 00:47:46.886]  Because we're so used to TV and Netflix and our phones.
[00:47:48.311 --> 00:47:53.078]  And we live in these little islands, these little oases of wealth, but it's all going away.
[00:47:53.158 --> 00:47:53.799]  It's all fake.
[00:47:53.859 --> 00:47:54.660]  It's all fraudulent.
[00:47:55.141 --> 00:48:03.233]  Every instinct I've got, and my instincts are never wrong, is drop everything and move to some remote area
[00:48:04.369 --> 00:48:07.010]  In the middle of nowhere in Eastern Europe or something.
[00:48:07.331 --> 00:48:11.053]  I mean, I'm just telling you, everything you see is going to be gone in 10 years.
[00:48:11.533 --> 00:48:13.194]  This is going to be hell on earth.
[00:48:13.734 --> 00:48:16.735]  Starvation, mass war, death, total global collapse.
[00:48:16.996 --> 00:48:19.317]  And they're going to release bioweapons and wipe everybody out.
[00:48:19.717 --> 00:48:20.878]  And the survivors will be thankful.
[00:48:21.258 --> 00:48:22.198]  So just get ready to die.
[00:48:22.218 --> 00:48:22.939]  I'm telling you, get ready.
[00:48:22.959 --> 00:48:23.859]  They're going to kill everybody.
[00:48:24.079 --> 00:48:24.580]  We'll be right back.
[00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:30.723]  All right, we're now into our number two on this March 30th Tuesday transmission.
[00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:40.686]  Again, I'm very, very blessed to be here, very thankful for all of you who tune in and who put up with me and who understand the message is more important than the messenger and who get all of this out.
[00:48:42.248 --> 00:48:44.849]  We're going to be joined by Paul Joseph Watson in the fourth hour.
[00:48:44.869 --> 00:48:50.934]  He's got a lot to cover, always riveting, always dynamic, always very cutting edge, and
[00:48:52.293 --> 00:48:58.641]  Owen Troyer, who has done a splendid job with the crew, in just 26 or 27 hours at the border, he's going to stay a few more days, hopefully.
[00:48:59.342 --> 00:49:04.168]  They are down there at the Texas-Mexico border, where it can only be described as bedlam.
[00:49:05.410 --> 00:49:07.152]  I mean, normally it's pretty quiet down there.
[00:49:07.572 --> 00:49:09.615]  There's a few illegals coming across, going back and forth.
[00:49:09.635 --> 00:49:10.295]  There's some action.
[00:49:11.196 --> 00:49:14.219]  It looks like just sports stadiums of people everywhere.
[00:49:14.239 --> 00:49:18.404]  There's just thousands of cars everywhere, 18 wheelers, buildings being erected.
[00:49:18.604 --> 00:49:20.646]  You drive two miles, more being erected.
[00:49:21.567 --> 00:49:25.611]  Tent cities where the adult illegals are who are criminals.
[00:49:27.154 --> 00:49:30.736]  Who don't want to be apprehended because there's still that underground flow into the country as well.
[00:49:31.276 --> 00:49:33.036]  It is just pandemonium.
[00:49:33.056 --> 00:49:34.597]  Border Patrol's been ordered to stand down.
[00:49:35.077 --> 00:49:43.401]  They're now being ordered to aid to bed, giving children over to people who've not had criminal background checks, just putting them on airplanes and buses just like Obama did.
[00:49:43.421 --> 00:49:49.083]  And the Senate found tens of thousands of children placed with smugglers and sex traffickers, Senate report.
[00:49:50.649 --> 00:49:53.550]  It's just the bottom has fallen out of the country.
[00:49:54.050 --> 00:49:55.190]  And you know what that means next.
[00:49:55.250 --> 00:49:56.431]  I mean, they're going to take the guns.
[00:49:56.451 --> 00:49:58.211]  They're like, that'll start a civil war.
[00:49:58.351 --> 00:49:58.932]  They want to.
[00:49:59.552 --> 00:50:02.873]  China and the EU and the globalists want us out of the way.
[00:50:04.773 --> 00:50:06.254]  I'm not looking forward to a civil war.
[00:50:07.534 --> 00:50:14.156]  I'm not intending to lead a civil war either, because it's obvious that the media has tried to brand me as a guy that wants violence.
[00:50:14.776 --> 00:50:17.677]  We don't have George Washington today, and we don't have the people we had in 1776.
[00:50:18.978 --> 00:50:19.978]  We got a lot of good people.
[00:50:21.232 --> 00:50:28.355]  But it's just the world is so complex, the world is so evil, that physical revolution isn't going to fix this.
[00:50:29.175 --> 00:50:34.657]  It's going to be cultural revolution, spiritual revolution, turning away from Satan and pulling out of his systems.
[00:50:35.317 --> 00:50:39.599]  And I'm realizing I can't live in Austin and protect my children and protect myself.
[00:50:40.079 --> 00:50:45.081]  I mean, you cannot live inside Sodom and Gomorrah 2.0 and stay out of it.
[00:50:45.361 --> 00:50:47.322]  I mean, look at that drone footage our crew just shot yesterday.
[00:50:49.420 --> 00:50:56.569]  It's again, we're creating a whole section at Bandot Video called the border crisis page, where all of this is.
[00:50:56.629 --> 00:51:01.354]  I mean, look, our kids in public school, a lot of them don't get an area that nice, soccer fields, all the rest of it.
[00:51:02.235 --> 00:51:08.343]  And so you have to understand that Trump built all that.
[00:51:10.185 --> 00:51:20.852]  And then now they're so overwhelming that they are having to stack the kids in the processing centers, three on top of each other, and look at all those buses pulling in, dumping the people off, and pulling in and driving out.
[00:51:22.473 --> 00:51:25.355]  I mean, it looks like aircraft carriers out there of buildings.
[00:51:25.455 --> 00:51:26.736]  I mean, it is just incredible.
[00:51:27.116 --> 00:51:29.198]  Yeah, that's a facility that's completed.
[00:51:29.218 --> 00:51:30.939]  That's Donna 1.
[00:51:31.039 --> 00:51:32.320]  Donna 2 is even bigger.
[00:51:33.181 --> 00:51:34.381]  And it's already got people in it.
[00:51:34.982 --> 00:51:36.163]  It's the one that's got all the squalor.
[00:51:37.236 --> 00:51:44.239]  And I mean, can you imagine the UN says 600 million coming in under their plan?
[00:51:44.499 --> 00:51:45.999]  And I'm telling you, I've watched the UN.
[00:51:46.259 --> 00:51:48.260]  What they say they're going to do, baby, they do.
[00:51:49.721 --> 00:51:53.302]  When they say no more poverty by 2030, that means they're going to kill the poor people.
[00:51:54.563 --> 00:52:03.566]  But before they release the bioweapon on them, they're going to flood us super bad with tens of millions, hundreds of millions, then lock the border down, lock us down, then hit the third world with a bioweapon.
[00:52:07.088 --> 00:52:09.409]  It is absolutely insane.
[00:52:11.769 --> 00:52:17.191]  You don't take people over with howitzers and fighter planes in the 21st century.
[00:52:17.211 --> 00:52:24.913]  You take them over with culture, with propaganda, and with third world populations that don't know where they are and will do whatever they're told and will vote to be slaves.
[00:52:26.313 --> 00:52:28.313]  That's all these folks are going to know is that Democrats own them.
[00:52:29.454 --> 00:52:30.394]  Permanent slave class.
[00:52:33.223 --> 00:52:37.064]  Just like a dam breaking, water's a great thing, until your dam breaks, you live below it, you drown.
[00:52:37.624 --> 00:52:39.504]  These illegal aliens, it's the same thing.
[00:52:40.925 --> 00:52:48.486]  And then they're not educated, they're not given nutritious meals, they do not get good upbringing, many of them, and they are dangerous.
[00:52:49.326 --> 00:52:52.807]  And the crime rates are just skyrocketing, there won't be any jobs for these people.
[00:52:53.707 --> 00:52:56.448]  They are coming into a country that's post-industrial, that's shutting down.
[00:52:57.588 --> 00:53:01.449]  And just Katie, bar the door, ladies and gentlemen, this is gonna be hell on earth.
[00:53:03.357 --> 00:53:09.779]  I really feel sorry for these poor little children, many of them being placed, but not just sex traffickers, but a lot of these kids are going to get tortured to death and gutted.
[00:53:09.799 --> 00:53:14.821]  There is such a taste for blood by the globalists, and they believe the more kids they kill, the more power they get.
[00:53:15.121 --> 00:53:18.843]  And so many of these illegal aliens are the same, raping and murdering their own damn children.
[00:53:20.203 --> 00:53:22.544]  And then the coyotes, the smugglers, smuggling in
[00:53:24.628 --> 00:53:28.610]  Sometimes 20, 30 times per child, over and over again, taking little boys, little girls.
[00:53:28.850 --> 00:53:35.853]  They'll find a dead three-year-old girl in a cornfield in South Texas, this is one case, and she'd been raped, they thought, hundreds of times.
[00:53:36.213 --> 00:53:40.355]  She was cut all over, had sores all over, and they'd use her to get in over and over again.
[00:53:40.375 --> 00:53:43.236]  And the Border Patrol was just told, this was under Obama,
[00:53:46.058 --> 00:53:46.538]  Let them do it!
[00:54:19.244 --> 00:54:27.832]  These articles first, and then get into the big one that's out today.
[00:54:28.072 --> 00:54:46.008]  But when Klaus Schwab said a few months ago at the Deimos event, virtual event, with all the fawning Hollywood scum and the rest of it in the virtual rooms,
[00:54:47.418 --> 00:54:50.920]  When he said, there will be no more industries where people are in close contact.
[00:54:53.201 --> 00:54:54.982]  Drones and robots will deliver everything.
[00:54:55.323 --> 00:54:56.423]  Well, who do you think can run that?
[00:54:56.543 --> 00:54:57.524]  Amazon, Apple?
[00:54:57.864 --> 00:55:00.386]  I mean, they're making people do this.
[00:55:00.606 --> 00:55:07.390]  And there'll be a big enough percentage of people in Europe, the US, and Japan, and China, that follow these orders.
[00:55:08.885 --> 00:55:18.571]  That that will be 10, 20%, 30% that gets the robots going and gets them building the roads, the sky roads, the systems, the infrastructure.
[00:55:19.211 --> 00:55:31.438]  Amazon has patents for 100 story buildings that have thousands of bays that huge drones, four propeller drones, just take off from and everything is delivered to them.
[00:55:35.794 --> 00:55:40.517]  And then, of course, you're not allowed out because there's a new virus out, there's a new crisis out, there's a new variant out.
[00:55:40.678 --> 00:55:41.678]  But the robot is.
[00:55:42.359 --> 00:55:44.701]  And how long do you think you're going to have money in the bank?
[00:55:44.721 --> 00:55:50.305]  How long do you think you're going to be around when you're obsolete, you're non-essential?
[00:55:50.845 --> 00:55:54.408]  Well, the answer is you'll be given a little video game like job working for these companies.
[00:55:54.768 --> 00:55:55.649]  It's really a make work.
[00:55:56.820 --> 00:56:03.926]  And then you'll oversee the drones and the control of the ghettos and the collapsing third world populations and the plague that's wiping people off.
[00:56:04.386 --> 00:56:06.768]  And you'll all just kind of wink, wink, know what's going on.
[00:56:08.029 --> 00:56:18.278]  But watch that ocean of death rising towards you in that high rise, both literally and figuratively, while you think you're so safe, training the AI how to kill humanity.
[00:56:18.378 --> 00:56:22.181]  I mean, this is a real AI nanotech takeover.
[00:56:26.946 --> 00:56:33.848]  All I know is we are in incredible times because my waking dreams now are the most intense they've ever been.
[00:56:34.808 --> 00:56:36.429]  I look forward to going to sleep at night now.
[00:56:36.449 --> 00:56:38.209]  I used to have nightmares and stuff.
[00:56:38.869 --> 00:56:49.192]  Now I just have incredible dreams of the future and what's going to happen and technology and just beauty and what we're going to build after we beat these people.
[00:56:49.792 --> 00:56:52.373]  I mean, it's a thousand times more beautiful than Hawaii.
[00:56:54.455 --> 00:56:57.741]  It's just, heaven is just, it's unspeakably good.
[00:56:58.462 --> 00:57:03.029]  And again, we're going to be in that and of that, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:03.770 --> 00:57:05.353]  And the enemy knows that and is really pissed.
[00:57:05.413 --> 00:57:08.358]  So, everything they build is ugly, everything God builds is beautiful.
[00:57:09.327 --> 00:57:09.847]  I don't think so.
[00:57:29.515 --> 00:57:36.480]  And it's, again, an article of the Associated Press, there it is, The Washington Times, just selling you dystopia.
[00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:37.620]  And the women love it.
[00:57:37.640 --> 00:57:39.221]  They love the dystopia.
[00:57:39.261 --> 00:57:40.702]  They love the Stockholm Syndrome.
[00:57:41.743 --> 00:57:45.726]  All of these evil people that have dug this pit to destroy us will be destroyed by what they're doing.
[00:57:45.746 --> 00:57:49.068]  They'll be betrayed by their god, Satan.
[00:57:49.994 --> 00:57:51.295]  All right, let's lay it out right now.
[00:57:51.996 --> 00:57:54.457]  We've read a lot of articles like this on there in the last couple years.
[00:57:54.497 --> 00:57:56.059]  This is the externalization of the method.
[00:57:56.639 --> 00:57:57.840]  You watch my film, Endgame.
[00:57:58.641 --> 00:58:01.263]  They're going to lock us up in our houses under the threat of bio-attack.
[00:58:03.064 --> 00:58:05.566]  Then they're going to release stronger and stronger bio-attacks each time.
[00:58:05.586 --> 00:58:08.088]  You've seen the exact word predictions off of their documents.
[00:58:08.889 --> 00:58:11.490]  I'll extrapolate the last 5% and of course it's dead accurate.
[00:58:13.092 --> 00:58:13.792]  But they tell you 95% of it.
[00:58:17.108 --> 00:58:21.970]  It's kind of when the mob says, gee, you better pay me protection money or I'll burn down your bodega.
[00:58:23.111 --> 00:58:25.672]  But they don't say, oh gee, you better pay me protection money.
[00:58:25.872 --> 00:58:28.713]  There's a lot of dangerous people around here who might burn down your bodega.
[00:58:28.953 --> 00:58:30.074]  Well, you know that's a threat.
[00:58:36.697 --> 00:58:38.898]  Well, now they're not even mincing words.
[00:58:40.302 --> 00:58:42.903]  And that's because they've had to get their own cult members on board.
[00:58:42.963 --> 00:58:49.984]  So I've got a big stack of articles the last few weeks saying the same thing, but let's just read this one right now.
[00:58:51.845 --> 00:58:53.205]  This is in my local paper.
[00:58:53.245 --> 00:58:54.365]  It's in the Washington Times.
[00:58:54.585 --> 00:58:56.086]  It's in papers all over the country.
[00:58:56.106 --> 00:58:56.906]  They want you to know this.
[00:58:56.926 --> 00:58:59.747]  It's sponsored by the New World Order.
[00:59:00.467 --> 00:59:04.268]  Dear Neumo, were you really that great in the first place?
[00:59:04.708 --> 00:59:05.888]  Sophia Rosenbaum.
[00:59:07.189 --> 00:59:08.309]  Everyone wants you back.
[00:59:09.548 --> 00:59:20.029]  It seems every day of this late-stage pandemic era, it's a new era, it's all Klaus Schwab words, is marked with something wistful thinking about normal.
[00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:23.983]  Remember, I always told you they're not going to let you go back to normalcy, but now they're telling you.
[00:59:24.443 --> 00:59:25.745]  Going back to you.
[00:59:25.885 --> 00:59:26.886]  Starting with you.
[00:59:27.246 --> 00:59:28.948]  It's all about norms and normalcy.
[00:59:29.328 --> 00:59:30.409]  All about you.
[00:59:30.429 --> 00:59:32.471]  So you don't be selfish.
[00:59:33.031 --> 00:59:34.973]  Can't ever allow another death from a virus.
[00:59:35.313 --> 00:59:36.334]  You gotta do what we say.
[00:59:36.354 --> 00:59:37.495]  So you don't be selfish.
[00:59:37.996 --> 00:59:40.698]  Yale, all of them have done studies on how to make you guilty.
[00:59:41.019 --> 00:59:44.021]  So now Sophie Rosenbaum's making you guilty again.
[00:59:45.282 --> 00:59:47.404]  Why, she might call you a Nazi if you don't do what she says.
[00:59:47.444 --> 00:59:48.484]  She's such a nice lady.
[00:59:49.125 --> 00:59:52.247]  As for me, I'm not so interested in normal.
[00:59:52.868 --> 00:59:54.369]  I defer to Taylor Swift.
[00:59:54.889 --> 00:59:57.371]  We are never, ever, ever getting back together.
[00:59:58.052 --> 00:59:59.072]  Oh, you're our God!
[00:59:59.112 --> 00:59:59.893]  You're telling us!
[00:59:59.973 --> 01:00:00.373]  Boy!
[01:00:01.434 --> 01:00:04.156]  It felt normal to want normal back at first.
[01:00:04.956 --> 01:00:11.761]  Last year in those first months, daydreaming of you was constant daily escape from all the endless dire possibilities.
[01:00:12.241 --> 01:00:13.362]  I wanted my life back.
[01:00:13.522 --> 01:00:14.543]  I wanted control.
[01:00:15.103 --> 01:00:16.304]  But you were a globalist stooge.
[01:00:16.344 --> 01:00:18.125]  You were a liar from the start, like your father.
[01:00:19.506 --> 01:00:23.649]  Complaining about commuting or being too busy was the norm in B.C.
[01:00:24.309 --> 01:00:25.070]  Before COVID.
[01:00:25.090 --> 01:00:27.011]  See, that's that swab says you'll be B.C.
[01:00:27.291 --> 01:00:28.852]  She was given talking points and just wrote this.
[01:00:29.353 --> 01:00:29.553]  Era.
[01:00:30.868 --> 01:00:34.390]  Before, in those early days, the mundane was what we craved.
[01:00:35.411 --> 01:00:36.831]  Packing into a subway car.
[01:00:36.951 --> 01:00:39.093]  Grabbing an unplanned drink with a friend.
[01:00:39.173 --> 01:00:40.393]  Oh gosh, no more of that.
[01:00:40.954 --> 01:00:41.854]  Hugging parents.
[01:00:41.934 --> 01:00:43.915]  Yeah, you don't do that now, Ms.
[01:00:43.935 --> 01:00:44.676]  Rosenbaum says.
[01:00:45.256 --> 01:00:48.878]  Striking up a conversation with a stranger.
[01:00:51.219 --> 01:00:53.501]  See, now you can only operate online.
[01:00:54.181 --> 01:00:56.422]  And if you don't do what they say, they take that away.
[01:00:56.542 --> 01:00:57.323]  See how that works?
[01:00:58.944 --> 01:00:59.644]  See how that works?
[01:01:02.054 --> 01:01:09.859]  And yet, of all those normal desires, felt entirely unfathomable, because the UN and the media told us, and you were under Stockholm Syndrome.
[01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:13.902]  Would we ever be able to be in a crowded space again?
[01:01:14.542 --> 01:01:15.563]  What a cult leader she is.
[01:01:15.583 --> 01:01:16.284]  Listen to this evil.
[01:01:16.884 --> 01:01:18.965]  If we could, would we want to?
[01:01:19.646 --> 01:01:22.087]  The answer then felt like a definite no.
[01:01:22.808 --> 01:01:25.209]  Oh no, never hug your mommy again.
[01:01:25.510 --> 01:01:25.790]  Never.
[01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:26.831]  Especially when
[01:01:27.671 --> 01:01:32.356]  Mortality and death consistently waited in our ears, all based on a hoax.
[01:01:32.376 --> 01:01:34.158]  Imagine if they reached a real bioweapon, what they could do.
[01:01:35.079 --> 01:01:41.746]  The fear of the unknown was like the weighted blanket, but that provided no comfort or warmth.
[01:01:42.366 --> 01:01:46.911]  It was then that I craved my normal most.
[01:01:49.423 --> 01:01:55.830]  Marie Claire, 86, left a resident in a nursing home, a revulsion center in Massachusetts, sharing a hug with her daughter.
[01:01:56.050 --> 01:01:56.691]  Oh, how bad.
[01:01:57.372 --> 01:01:58.052]  Oh, we caught her.
[01:01:58.413 --> 01:01:59.194]  It wasn't just me.
[01:01:59.354 --> 01:02:03.118]  Over the last year, our obsession with normalcy has shown up on Google.
[01:02:03.218 --> 01:02:04.319]  Oh, it's the new racism.
[01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:18.386]  With the highest spike in searches around mid-April 2020, when they were making us so desperate, when it seemed we might have been able to resume life that we once knew, because remember they only said two weeks, but once they had their handcuffs on, you're going to the dungeon.
[01:02:19.087 --> 01:02:24.529]  Searching for normal went up around the start of the school year in September and around the holidays of November.
[01:02:24.749 --> 01:02:26.770]  Yeah, you got to go to Google to see what it says to do.
[01:02:28.071 --> 01:02:31.753]  But as the search trends show, these desires for normalcy ebbed and flowed
[01:02:33.018 --> 01:02:35.219]  Consistently fading and morphing.
[01:02:35.359 --> 01:02:36.339]  Oh, you're fading.
[01:02:36.879 --> 01:02:38.380]  You don't want to be around people anymore.
[01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:40.541]  You don't want to get all their germs that make you healthier.
[01:02:40.821 --> 01:02:41.721]  You're not going to have sex now.
[01:02:41.741 --> 01:02:42.541]  You're not going to have children.
[01:02:42.561 --> 01:02:43.282]  You're not going to have barbecues.
[01:02:43.482 --> 01:02:45.342]  You're going to stay inside and watch the TV and the internet.
[01:02:45.362 --> 01:02:46.723]  You're going to stay on that phone.
[01:02:46.763 --> 01:02:47.083]  Yes.
[01:02:47.523 --> 01:02:47.823]  Yes.
[01:02:47.983 --> 01:02:48.624]  Good.
[01:02:49.624 --> 01:02:53.025]  The collective yearning for normalcy was panic-inducing early on.
[01:02:53.265 --> 01:02:53.465]  See?
[01:02:53.945 --> 01:02:55.566]  But we first got the handcuffs on now.
[01:02:55.606 --> 01:02:56.086]  It's okay.
[01:02:56.386 --> 01:02:57.987]  Just be quiet until we get you to the dungeon.
[01:02:59.204 --> 01:03:04.106]  Around the time President Donald Trump was vowing to reopen America in Easter 2020, so much had already changed.
[01:03:04.346 --> 01:03:09.488]  See, the Oracle isn't like, hey, we got you, we lied to you, we caught you, now it's never over, because they're all announcing it's never going to end now.
[01:03:09.948 --> 01:03:12.349]  It's just like, enjoy it, it's trendy.
[01:03:12.769 --> 01:03:20.372]  Yet it felt that when we might go back to normal, with a snap of a finger, I'd go warn the liberals downtown, they'd laugh at me and say, ha ha ha, it'll be open in a month.
[01:03:21.152 --> 01:03:26.297]  But June, the pandemic's staying power, you mean the fake PCR test, was more clear.
[01:03:26.817 --> 01:03:30.701]  And then Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was saying, we cannot go back to normal.
[01:03:31.141 --> 01:03:32.062]  He also works for China.
[01:03:32.362 --> 01:03:34.124]  We need new routines.
[01:03:34.244 --> 01:03:41.670]  Several months later, Vermont Governor Phil Scott said, we'll begin to again turn the spotlight once more back to whatever normal will be.
[01:03:41.770 --> 01:03:43.212]  But it was all a fake promise.
[01:03:44.793 --> 01:03:47.575]  By then, my brain was screaming, no way!
[01:03:47.955 --> 01:03:50.456]  And she just goes on to say, finally, she likes it.
[01:03:51.057 --> 01:03:52.077]  Finally, it's good.
[01:03:54.019 --> 01:03:56.260]  Finally, I just don't care.
[01:03:58.822 --> 01:03:59.942]  Finally, it's time.
[01:04:00.102 --> 01:04:01.563]  And the period of adjustment was there.
[01:04:02.044 --> 01:04:03.805]  It took a while to get used to, she says.
[01:04:04.946 --> 01:04:09.550]  Then we did, and what's happening again, right in the United States, and more people are vaccinated.
[01:04:09.610 --> 01:04:12.852]  Infectious disease already pulls our normal, our tugging.
[01:04:13.372 --> 01:04:16.074]  But she goes on to say, it's just better to not travel.
[01:04:16.655 --> 01:04:18.176]  It's better to not be involved.
[01:04:18.857 --> 01:04:21.559]  It's better to lose normal and don't want normal return.
[01:04:22.359 --> 01:04:23.300]  It's too late anyway.
[01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:27.023]  Remember, normal, you and me, we've already broken up.
[01:04:28.424 --> 01:04:28.564]  Aww.
[01:04:29.865 --> 01:04:30.646]  Isn't that cute?
[01:04:31.673 --> 01:04:32.333]  And that's sweet.
[01:04:32.713 --> 01:04:33.954]  I mean, I couldn't read more, folks.
[01:04:34.034 --> 01:04:35.174]  It's so sick and so evil.
[01:04:35.514 --> 01:04:36.594]  But hey, we got you.
[01:04:37.275 --> 01:04:37.815]  It's over.
[01:04:38.135 --> 01:04:39.015]  You're not essential.
[01:04:39.235 --> 01:04:40.055]  Go live in your house.
[01:04:40.075 --> 01:04:40.756]  You'll get a check.
[01:04:41.016 --> 01:04:42.216]  Robots deliver stuff for now.
[01:04:43.356 --> 01:04:45.257]  And it was never coming back.
[01:04:45.317 --> 01:04:45.937]  And it's real, man.
[01:04:45.957 --> 01:04:54.619]  Now the left is just like wearing masks more and staying in more and just getting off on their power joining Satan in this great lie.
[01:04:55.260 --> 01:04:56.560]  All of it was people that got
[01:04:58.089 --> 01:04:58.990]  Stick from other things and die.
[01:04:59.550 --> 01:05:00.991]  All of it was vitamin and mineral deficiencies.
[01:05:01.111 --> 01:05:01.971]  All of it was BS.
[01:05:02.292 --> 01:05:03.612]  All of it was fake PCR tests.
[01:05:04.953 --> 01:05:05.493]  What does it matter?
[01:05:05.513 --> 01:05:08.455]  The lawyers say, oh, sorry, you're going to have a comedy show?
[01:05:08.775 --> 01:05:10.797]  Only have 25% there in COVID tests.
[01:05:11.157 --> 01:05:13.178]  And then Joe Rogan and Dave Chappelle do it.
[01:05:13.998 --> 01:05:15.119]  And then everybody else adopts it.
[01:05:15.159 --> 01:05:16.740]  Nothing against Joe, but that's how it is.
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.721]  And then our own futures are all destroyed.
[01:05:18.741 --> 01:05:21.123]  I told Joe Rogan a year ago, I said, it'll never end.
[01:05:21.543 --> 01:05:22.443]  It'll only be enforced.
[01:05:22.463 --> 01:05:23.704]  And they're going to come out and celebrate.
[01:05:23.744 --> 01:05:24.525]  It's about carbon.
[01:05:25.045 --> 01:05:26.126]  And it's about locking us down.
[01:05:26.886 --> 01:05:27.767]  And now he knows it's true.
[01:05:27.967 --> 01:05:30.809]  So what do we do now that we know Alex Jones is right again?
[01:05:31.070 --> 01:05:31.970]  I don't want to be right.
[01:05:32.151 --> 01:05:33.472]  It's a damn globalist plan.
[01:05:33.712 --> 01:05:34.553]  I want to say no.
[01:05:35.133 --> 01:05:37.755]  I'll cover this more after Owen's on, and we've got a guest joining us.
[01:05:37.776 --> 01:05:42.720]  I've got a whole stack of articles where they push this, or they're shutting off all the infrastructure and say they're going to kill us.
[01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:45.222]  I mean, I know it's nightmarish, because it is.
[01:05:45.322 --> 01:05:45.802]  It's real.
[01:05:46.043 --> 01:05:48.985]  It's like when you're in a store and a guy walks in with a gun and starts shooting people.
[01:05:49.185 --> 01:05:50.587]  I'm sorry, but it's really happening.
[01:05:51.167 --> 01:06:00.969]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, Owen, the SJW destroyer, Schroyer, is on the Texas-Mexico border where there is a giant U.N.
[01:06:00.989 --> 01:06:01.490]  invasion.
[01:06:01.930 --> 01:06:10.592]  The president of the U.S., the puppet chief who stole the election, said, once I'm president, surge the border immediately.
[01:06:11.192 --> 01:06:17.775]  And now we're seeing 10, 20-fold, no one knows, giant 20,000-person, 10,000-person facilities being built everywhere.
[01:06:17.795 --> 01:06:19.436]  Exclusive drone footage.
[01:06:19.536 --> 01:06:21.237]  Owen and the crew went to the local airport.
[01:06:21.837 --> 01:06:22.898]  They're outside McAllen.
[01:06:24.068 --> 01:06:40.664]  And showed all the illegals there, whole families, children, with no IDs, not even knowing how to speak English, not even knowing what their gate is, wandering around the airport, just being dumped off to be flown to God knows where to be exploited, put into slave labor, sex slavery, Senate reported meds.
[01:06:40.764 --> 01:06:43.847]  I mean, this is so criminal and not even an executive order.
[01:06:43.927 --> 01:06:45.849]  It's just totally illegal.
[01:06:46.610 --> 01:06:49.132]  The executive order could be challenged, so Biden isn't doing that.
[01:06:49.632 --> 01:06:52.595]  This is serious crimes against humanity, crimes against our country.
[01:06:53.375 --> 01:06:54.356]  This is unbelievable.
[01:06:54.416 --> 01:06:57.138]  So, the Alex Jones Show is live from the U.N.
[01:06:57.178 --> 01:06:59.120]  invasion point on the Texas-Mexico border.
[01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:00.181]  Share the link.
[01:07:00.381 --> 01:07:02.823]  Owen Schroer on a boat in the Rio Grande.
[01:07:02.923 --> 01:07:06.566]  Owen, tell us where you are and what you've seen unfold, my friend.
[01:07:08.422 --> 01:07:10.606]  Alex, there is so much to say.
[01:07:10.766 --> 01:07:20.042]  I'll tell you that right now we are staking out a location on the Rio Grande where they have an inflatable raft, boat type of thing.
[01:07:20.698 --> 01:07:22.058]  And it's like the videos you see.
[01:07:22.118 --> 01:07:24.859]  They put 10 or so people on the inflatable boat.
[01:07:25.319 --> 01:07:26.380]  They float them across the river.
[01:07:26.460 --> 01:07:27.120]  They dump them off.
[01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:28.180]  They get to the other side.
[01:07:29.140 --> 01:07:30.861]  And so we're staking out that location.
[01:07:30.901 --> 01:07:31.901]  We know where the boat is.
[01:07:31.941 --> 01:07:43.084]  When we got onto the river today and we were pulling up, we saw them come ashore on the Mexico side and they ran up that riverbank and they dumped that boat and they ran out into the woods before we could really catch them.
[01:07:43.845 --> 01:07:48.366]  And then we saw hooded men in black hoods running along the riverbank.
[01:07:49.166 --> 01:07:50.888]  So it looked like some cartel activity.
[01:07:50.928 --> 01:07:56.852]  Now, where to begin on everything that we've experienced just from being down here for 24 hours, Alex?
[01:07:57.533 --> 01:08:01.015]  Let me explain the big picture so the audience is clear.
[01:08:01.916 --> 01:08:11.023]  We have a well-oiled, well-planned, organized, funded invasion happening in our southern border.
[01:08:11.849 --> 01:08:18.093]  Now, this is a very nuanced thing because the people that are coming here, they're not necessarily militant.
[01:08:18.133 --> 01:08:25.437]  Most of the people probably are just being told, hey, come in here, we'll give you free food, we'll give you free money, we'll put you in a hotel room, we'll fly you wherever you want to go.
[01:08:25.457 --> 01:08:27.398]  You got family, you got friends, we'll get you there.
[01:08:27.678 --> 01:08:29.719]  Don't speak English, doesn't matter, we'll give you a map.
[01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:31.700]  We'll give you the bus routes.
[01:08:32.341 --> 01:08:36.143]  And so, when we saw that report break at NewsWars.com last night,
[01:08:37.068 --> 01:08:42.249]  of the envelopes at the airport in McAllen, we said, well, look, we're 20 minutes away.
[01:08:42.490 --> 01:08:45.710]  There's one last flight out of McAllen to Las Vegas.
[01:08:45.830 --> 01:08:48.291]  Let's just get into that airport and see if we can find it.
[01:08:48.691 --> 01:08:54.553]  Sure enough, last flight out to Vegas, we found three groups with the same Manila envelopes.
[01:08:54.893 --> 01:08:58.774]  And as you saw on the video uploaded to BandOut Video, it shows them the gates they're on.
[01:08:59.114 --> 01:09:01.515]  It shows them their flights, their transfer flights.
[01:09:01.935 --> 01:09:04.976]  And the one people that we talked to that were speaking Spanish,
[01:09:05.603 --> 01:09:17.912]  So they are going to be laid over, so they probably just flew from Vegas to Salt Lake City today, probably staged at a Catholic church charitable facility like what we just saw in McAllen.
[01:09:17.932 --> 01:09:22.535]  So here's more breaking news, and we've got more HD footage coming to Band Out Video, Alex.
[01:09:23.254 --> 01:09:27.575]  At the bus station in McAllen, there is a migrant facility.
[01:09:28.036 --> 01:09:29.456]  They are doing COVID testing.
[01:09:29.936 --> 01:09:35.918]  And then catty-corner to that, there is a Catholic Church charity organization where they're staging them.
[01:09:36.298 --> 01:09:37.539]  They have bus loads.
[01:09:37.599 --> 01:09:39.679]  We were there for maybe half an hour.
[01:09:39.980 --> 01:09:43.721]  We saw three bus loads get dropped off with families, tons of young kids.
[01:09:44.141 --> 01:09:46.362]  And then we saw them getting out of the migrant facility.
[01:09:46.642 --> 01:09:48.822]  Supposedly that's where they're being tested for COVID.
[01:09:49.243 --> 01:09:50.323]  And then they get released.
[01:09:51.474 --> 01:10:04.686]  Over to the Catholic Charities, which is where most of them go and stay until they can get a ride, until they can get a bus, until they can get a flight out, and there they're sheltered, there's food, they get clothes, and they can stay there as long as they want.
[01:10:05.027 --> 01:10:17.118]  Some of the people though, we can see, they get out of the bus station or they get out of the COVID testing center, and then the Catholic Charity people say, no, go in here, we'll give you shelter and food, and then they just walk down the street.
[01:10:17.717 --> 01:10:18.398]  So who are we going to vote for?
[01:10:32.715 --> 01:10:45.506]  They're turning our federal government in charge of protecting our border into coyotes and human traffickers.
[01:10:45.926 --> 01:10:48.488]  It's unbelievable, Alex, and I feel bad for these people.
[01:10:48.709 --> 01:10:49.910]  Who knows what they're being told?
[01:10:50.150 --> 01:10:52.131]  Who knows what they're being given in these envelopes?
[01:10:52.432 --> 01:10:53.813]  Who knows where they're going to end up?
[01:10:54.113 --> 01:11:14.261]  But it's tens of thousands every day at each facility like clockwork, Alex, like clockwork on the planes with envelopes, on the buses with envelopes, in the Catholic facilities with envelopes, getting unmarked vehicles to drive, busloads being dropped off by the half hour.
[01:11:14.581 --> 01:11:17.702]  That's the thing here is that there is no executive order.
[01:11:17.842 --> 01:11:18.903]  There is no law.
[01:11:19.463 --> 01:11:20.403]  This is organized.
[01:11:20.423 --> 01:11:21.023]  This is illegal.
[01:11:21.083 --> 01:11:22.344]  Biden told them to come here.
[01:11:23.482 --> 01:11:25.984]  The children are being exploited, as you said.
[01:11:26.004 --> 01:11:35.113]  They then are making the Border Patrol be active participants in the smuggling, and the Republicans are only bitching about the kids being stacked up wrong, which is important.
[01:11:35.153 --> 01:11:36.834]  The big issue is this is all illegal!
[01:11:37.275 --> 01:11:41.979]  Democrats would be in court blocking this right now if it was Trump, you know, blocking illegals.
[01:11:42.059 --> 01:11:43.200]  Instead, nothing's being done.
[01:11:43.220 --> 01:11:43.921]  This is insane!
[01:11:46.460 --> 01:11:49.223]  It's a well-funded, well-organized invasion, Alex.
[01:11:49.303 --> 01:11:50.044]  And you know what?
[01:11:50.184 --> 01:11:56.530]  It's meant to collapse the United States of America, just like they collapsed Central America into the United States of America.
[01:11:56.791 --> 01:11:59.493]  And nobody's asking, hey, what is going on in these countries?
[01:11:59.533 --> 01:12:00.795]  What's going on in Guatemala?
[01:12:00.835 --> 01:12:02.036]  What's going on in Honduras?
[01:12:02.476 --> 01:12:03.077]  What's going on?
[01:12:03.217 --> 01:12:09.579]  Let's be clear, it was the lockdowns that caused, all these people are interviewed, they say, we're here because of the lockdown, we're starving to death.
[01:12:09.919 --> 01:12:19.783]  So the UN, the globalists, starve everybody to death, then organize them in migrant caravans, bring them up here, same thing they did triggering the Arab Spring that then forced tens of millions of Muslims into Europe.
[01:12:19.983 --> 01:12:21.243]  This is an exact plan.
[01:12:21.403 --> 01:12:22.584]  The UN even admits it, Owen.
[01:12:24.855 --> 01:12:34.137]  Imagine though, Alex, you know, you go on journalistic trips like this, usually crews have to stay in a situation like this for a week or even a month, you know, to get the footage and get the story.
[01:12:34.477 --> 01:12:38.838]  We were here for 24 hours and got all of it.
[01:12:39.378 --> 01:12:41.619]  It was like hole in one after hole in one.
[01:12:41.859 --> 01:12:45.199]  And that's when you realize that this is, this is unbelievable.
[01:12:45.239 --> 01:12:46.660]  This is, this is so mass.
[01:12:46.700 --> 01:12:48.040]  This is so large scale.
[01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:53.341]  This is so well organized, so well funded, so many involved, and there is zero right now.
[01:12:53.721 --> 01:12:55.787]  Zero policy to do anything about it.
[01:12:56.673 --> 01:12:59.435]  Zero effort at all to try to mitigate this.
[01:13:00.055 --> 01:13:02.837]  Zero effort to try to figure out what's going on in Central America.
[01:13:03.097 --> 01:13:11.683]  It has to collapse into the United States of America, where we've absorbed 20% of their population in the last two decades.
[01:13:11.843 --> 01:13:13.084]  Nobody's asking these questions.
[01:13:13.264 --> 01:13:15.405]  Nobody's wondering, where is all the money coming from?
[01:13:15.626 --> 01:13:16.666]  Where is all the money going?
[01:13:16.886 --> 01:13:18.367]  What about all the Americans that are suffering?
[01:13:18.387 --> 01:13:20.008]  What about all the Americans that can't get back to work?
[01:13:20.169 --> 01:13:22.470]  What about all the Americans that didn't get their stimulus package?
[01:13:22.490 --> 01:13:24.892]  And by the way, a lot of these migrants have cell phones.
[01:13:25.492 --> 01:13:27.673]  A lot of these migrants have cell phones that are dressed nice.
[01:13:28.514 --> 01:13:32.196]  They're obviously paying an organization in Coyotes a lot of money to get up here.
[01:13:35.098 --> 01:13:36.559]  Alex, let me be clear about another thing.
[01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:44.545]  You know, the family that I briefly spoke to at the airport last night that's in the video featured at Band.Video and the stories at NewsWars.com.
[01:13:45.045 --> 01:13:51.029]  I mean, Alex, I looked into their eyes and I mean, my heart broke because they just get dropped off and they don't even have
[01:13:52.476 --> 01:13:57.519]  And I thought they're looking at me like, oh, they're suspicious of me because I guess I looked like I was law enforcement or something.
[01:13:57.539 --> 01:13:59.620]  They thought maybe we were trying to, you know, pick them up.
[01:14:00.201 --> 01:14:00.981]  No, no.
[01:14:01.121 --> 01:14:04.143]  And then as soon as we talked to him, they realized that they were like begging for help.
[01:14:04.503 --> 01:14:05.684]  They're like, where's my gate?
[01:14:05.784 --> 01:14:06.644]  Where's my plane?
[01:14:06.684 --> 01:14:07.385]  What do I do?
[01:14:08.530 --> 01:14:10.312]  It's just like, what are they going to do when they get into the States?
[01:14:10.332 --> 01:14:11.953]  What are they going to do when they get to Salt Lake City?
[01:14:11.993 --> 01:14:13.054]  What are they going to do with their family?
[01:14:13.074 --> 01:14:14.495]  What are they going to do with their little girl?
[01:14:14.515 --> 01:14:17.678]  They're going to be exploited by the groups waiting on the other end, Owen.
[01:14:17.718 --> 01:14:19.459]  The other groups are waiting on the other end.
[01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:20.720]  God help them.
[01:14:21.041 --> 01:14:22.102]  This is so damn evil.
[01:14:24.223 --> 01:14:30.088]  And so, like I said, we're sitting here on the Rio Grande now, and we're staking out a location that we know.
[01:14:32.649 --> 01:14:33.610]  Oh, and stay there.
[01:14:33.730 --> 01:14:35.131]  Your Skype's breaking up a bit.
[01:14:35.171 --> 01:14:36.091]  We're coming right back to you.
[01:14:49.599 --> 01:14:51.480]  What an incredible time to be alive.
[01:14:51.500 --> 01:14:54.761]  We're supposed to all be on Skype and Zoom, locked up in our houses, but we're not.
[01:14:55.222 --> 01:14:57.443]  We are on the Texas-Mexico border where the U.N.
[01:14:57.543 --> 01:15:09.648]  and Joe Biden are treasonously collapsing our border, just like Europe saw, with a planned invasion using all the poor people they starved to death, or near death, with their COVID lockdowns, which we told you a year ago would be coming.
[01:15:10.068 --> 01:15:11.529]  This is so damn diabolical.
[01:15:11.589 --> 01:15:17.211]  While they shut our coal off and our energy and our jobs off here, they're literally coming to a country that's going to collapse on top of it.
[01:15:17.471 --> 01:15:17.992]  We'll be right back.
[01:15:18.012 --> 01:15:18.372]  Stay with us.
[01:15:19.497 --> 01:15:22.019]  Slowly, so I have the Mexico side, but it's not behind me.
[01:15:22.780 --> 01:15:23.080]  Thank you.
[01:15:34.667 --> 01:15:37.588]  There is no cell support on that river.
[01:15:38.308 --> 01:15:38.828]  Very little.
[01:15:38.928 --> 01:15:46.150]  We have a special cell tower unit they carry that is able to basically do things where nobody else can.
[01:15:46.590 --> 01:15:49.751]  So that's the only reason that you're able to see this.
[01:15:49.771 --> 01:15:51.652]  That's why when you see Ted Cruz or even the president...
[01:15:52.472 --> 01:15:59.763]  Down there you can't get cell source, but we're able to do it because we actually carry a portable cell tower around with us.
[01:16:00.123 --> 01:16:02.246]  Probably not too good for the guys long term.
[01:16:02.687 --> 01:16:05.331]  That's what we had in DC in like a baby carriage.
[01:16:06.553 --> 01:16:07.373]  You have a million people.
[01:16:07.653 --> 01:16:08.674]  They all take the cell power.
[01:16:08.754 --> 01:16:13.136]  We have a direct system that's budgeted for how much power we get from a cell tower.
[01:16:13.456 --> 01:16:18.538]  We're able to get into the cell towers and demand the service and basically take over that allotted part we paid for.
[01:16:18.938 --> 01:16:21.259]  That's what your support does at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:16:21.719 --> 01:16:23.700]  Owen, continue as you race along the border.
[01:16:23.720 --> 01:16:25.540]  Some of the incredible stuff you've witnessed.
[01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:26.721]  You've been out there at night as well.
[01:16:27.061 --> 01:16:28.101]  You were just laying it out.
[01:16:28.522 --> 01:16:29.102]  Please continue.
[01:16:31.152 --> 01:16:36.897]  Yeah, Alex, and you can kind of see to my right side here, this is the Mexico side of the Rio Grande.
[01:16:36.937 --> 01:16:39.779]  So that's what people are seeing behind me as we're floating the river here.
[01:16:40.380 --> 01:16:48.667]  We're staking out a couple locations where we believe they're... Yeah, Owen, tell the camera crew to pan around and show folks some more of the stuff going on.
[01:16:51.069 --> 01:16:53.371]  Let's not show the CIA commandos in the back of the boat.
[01:16:53.511 --> 01:16:53.972]  I'm joking.
[01:16:54.332 --> 01:16:54.892]  Actually, I'm not.
[01:16:54.992 --> 01:16:56.494]  So let's just go ahead and scroll around.
[01:16:57.731 --> 01:17:00.394]  So Alex, I want to explain what we discovered today.
[01:17:01.795 --> 01:17:13.206]  We decided we were going to go check out the Greyhound bus stop because just like what we saw at the airport last night, we assumed that people would be going there and we could find more of those manila envelopes.
[01:17:13.366 --> 01:17:15.328]  Well, we pull up to the
[01:17:16.850 --> 01:17:17.471]  I'm good.
[01:17:37.071 --> 01:17:38.632]  All the different stops and facilities.
[01:17:38.672 --> 01:17:39.872]  They're busing them in from the border.
[01:17:39.892 --> 01:17:40.653]  They're putting them there.
[01:17:40.973 --> 01:17:43.114]  We were told that's where they're COVID testing them.
[01:17:43.134 --> 01:17:44.634]  A bunch of children.
[01:17:44.694 --> 01:17:50.537]  We have really, so much footage where you can hear a bunch of children wailing, crying out for mommy.
[01:17:51.197 --> 01:17:51.977]  It's really sad.
[01:17:52.017 --> 01:17:53.018]  And so that's going on.
[01:17:53.398 --> 01:17:57.900]  Then they send them over to the Catholic facility where they don't even have to go in.
[01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:00.861]  Some of them just get released and they just walk down the road and they're gone.
[01:18:01.301 --> 01:18:03.722]  Most of them go into the Catholic facilities because in there,
[01:18:04.577 --> 01:18:06.098]  They're getting their Manila envelope.
[01:18:06.558 --> 01:18:18.364]  So, I mean, we park the car, we get out of the car, and immediately there's multiple groups getting out of the Catholic facility, and they all have the same Manila envelopes, Alex.
[01:18:18.804 --> 01:18:19.745]  Who is funding this?
[01:18:19.865 --> 01:18:20.866]  What is in the Manila envelopes?
[01:18:20.886 --> 01:18:22.807]  And listen, I know you've already followed so much footage.
[01:18:22.827 --> 01:18:23.787]  You've done a great job.
[01:18:24.187 --> 01:18:26.128]  You've already followed so much footage, I can't watch it all.
[01:18:26.408 --> 01:18:31.051]  Do we have that footage at Man.Video in the border crisis section yet, or when are we going to get that?
[01:18:32.068 --> 01:18:32.628]  I'm not sure, guys.
[01:18:32.688 --> 01:18:35.190]  Do we have anything from the bus stop today up at Band Yet?
[01:18:37.071 --> 01:18:37.492]  Uh, no.
[01:18:37.532 --> 01:18:39.053]  It's sitting on our... No, no, no.
[01:18:39.073 --> 01:18:39.633]  I understand.
[01:18:39.693 --> 01:18:40.433]  Take your time.
[01:18:40.453 --> 01:18:40.874]  I understand.
[01:18:40.894 --> 01:18:46.017]  So you've got bombshell proof of Catholic charities shipping people illegally into the U.S.
[01:18:46.097 --> 01:18:47.078]  and taking them to the airport.
[01:18:48.405 --> 01:18:50.928]  Alex, I'm telling you, it was like clockwork.
[01:18:51.308 --> 01:18:55.353]  We parked the car, and immediately tons of people come out of the facility.
[01:18:55.393 --> 01:18:58.496]  They all have the Manila folders, just like we saw everywhere else.
[01:18:58.797 --> 01:19:02.120]  We walked down the street to the tent facility that they have set up.
[01:19:02.601 --> 01:19:04.443]  Three bus loads, we caught them all on camera.
[01:19:04.703 --> 01:19:07.707]  Bus load, bus load, bus load, dropping off.
[01:19:08.648 --> 01:19:10.129]  Huge groups, and these were families.
[01:19:10.449 --> 01:19:12.851]  These were mostly women and young children.
[01:19:12.951 --> 01:19:14.172]  I mean young children.
[01:19:14.953 --> 01:19:16.034]  Toddlers, infants.
[01:19:16.314 --> 01:19:20.718]  We saw a couple of males, but it was mostly females and their toddlers.
[01:19:21.038 --> 01:19:24.361]  So who knows what kind of journey they've been through trying to get to the border.
[01:19:24.702 --> 01:19:26.143]  Most of them don't speak English.
[01:19:26.683 --> 01:19:28.705]  In fact, I'm not sure if any of them spoke English.
[01:19:29.045 --> 01:19:30.687]  Some of them have rare dialects of
[01:19:31.027 --> 01:19:32.988]  And there they were asking you where the gate was, what to do.
[01:19:33.008 --> 01:19:34.668]  You talk about people being set up for exploitation.
[01:19:34.688 --> 01:19:36.168]  This is an incredible crime.
[01:19:36.188 --> 01:19:38.809]  And like you said, you've been to the border many times.
[01:19:38.849 --> 01:19:40.330]  This is much worse than it's ever been before, Owen.
[01:20:01.881 --> 01:20:03.802]  Alex, I'm telling you, we were stunned.
[01:20:04.362 --> 01:20:11.266]  Like I said, most of the time you come out for a trip like this, it takes you maybe a day, even a week, sometimes a month to get this story complete.
[01:20:11.706 --> 01:20:14.787]  It took us 24 hours because it's just like clockwork.
[01:20:15.108 --> 01:20:18.589]  You just go stand outside this bus facility, you're going to catch it all in an hour.
[01:20:18.809 --> 01:20:22.851]  You go stand at the airport, you're going to catch all these people showing up with familial envelopes.
[01:20:23.111 --> 01:20:23.632]  Just like that.
[01:20:23.952 --> 01:20:27.634]  You go up and down the border today at the Rio Grande, you're going to see inflatable tubes.
[01:20:27.654 --> 01:20:29.074]  You're going to see people coming across.
[01:20:29.114 --> 01:20:30.115]  You're going to hear about it.
[01:20:30.535 --> 01:20:31.936]  The facilities are so overwhelmed.
[01:20:32.256 --> 01:20:33.257]  Alex, talk about that.
[01:20:53.166 --> 01:20:57.748]  I predict it'll be ten times worse in six months, a hundred times worse in two years.
[01:20:58.008 --> 01:20:58.349]  The U.N.
[01:20:58.389 --> 01:20:59.749]  wants $600 million up here.
[01:21:00.029 --> 01:21:01.410]  It'll totally collapse the U.S.
[01:21:01.430 --> 01:21:02.771]  We already have tent cities everywhere.
[01:21:03.191 --> 01:21:06.433]  This is how you take a country down, plow it and pivot bankrupting it.
[01:21:06.793 --> 01:21:08.013]  We've got to have governors.
[01:21:08.834 --> 01:21:11.435]  Even Ted Cruz and the people down there don't even get how bad it is.
[01:21:12.015 --> 01:21:15.637]  It's Biden criminally waiving the law, letting them in.
[01:21:16.017 --> 01:21:18.338]  Congress and the courts must act now, Owen.
[01:21:18.358 --> 01:21:19.199]  This is incredible.
[01:21:20.433 --> 01:21:21.093]  No, Alex.
[01:21:21.133 --> 01:21:22.074]  Let's call it what it is.
[01:21:22.414 --> 01:21:25.456]  This is open treason being committed by the White House.
[01:21:25.576 --> 01:21:26.636]  This is open treason.
[01:21:26.937 --> 01:21:28.077]  There's no room for debate.
[01:21:28.337 --> 01:21:29.618]  There's no room to play games.
[01:21:29.838 --> 01:21:31.079]  There's no room to mince words.
[01:21:31.319 --> 01:21:32.500]  This is open treason.
[01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:34.941]  They are facilitating an illegal invasion.
[01:21:35.201 --> 01:21:37.563]  They are facilitating an economic collapse.
[01:21:37.843 --> 01:21:40.304]  They are facilitating the collapse of the United States.
[01:21:40.544 --> 01:21:41.825]  This cannot be joked about.
[01:21:42.185 --> 01:21:43.126]  This is a serious deal.
[01:21:43.146 --> 01:21:45.967]  We've never seen such open treason from an administration before, Alex.
[01:21:46.147 --> 01:21:47.708]  It's time for the Republicans to get serious.
[01:21:48.108 --> 01:21:49.189]  It's time for America to get serious.
[01:21:52.292 --> 01:21:53.353]  Oh, it's just incredible.
[01:21:53.373 --> 01:21:56.956]  I don't want to say what you guys are planning next, but you know, I'm not in charge of this.
[01:21:56.996 --> 01:21:58.898]  I said, stay as long or as little as you want.
[01:21:58.918 --> 01:22:02.821]  You know, I'm going to be coming down with some other folks either this weekend or early next week.
[01:22:03.222 --> 01:22:05.163]  I'm going to be down there and we'll just leave it at that.
[01:22:05.224 --> 01:22:05.744]  But wow.
[01:22:05.764 --> 01:22:08.026]  I mean, like you said, you turn to the left, you turn to the right.
[01:22:08.066 --> 01:22:08.767]  It's all insane.
[01:22:10.902 --> 01:22:12.343]  Well, and here's the other thing, too.
[01:22:12.844 --> 01:22:14.505]  There is no plan to stop this.
[01:22:15.126 --> 01:22:15.847]  There's nothing.
[01:22:15.927 --> 01:22:17.128]  There's no mitigation plan.
[01:22:17.148 --> 01:22:18.129]  There's no new policy.
[01:22:18.249 --> 01:22:19.910]  They're tearing the wall down.
[01:22:19.930 --> 01:22:22.112]  Like you said, it's only going to get worse.
[01:22:22.453 --> 01:22:23.754]  Of course it's only going to get worse.
[01:22:23.974 --> 01:22:26.657]  In fact, the only thing that may mitigate this
[01:22:27.237 --> 01:22:33.380]  Is people that do get into the country illegally then calling their friends and family back home saying, hey, you know what?
[01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:35.041]  You probably shouldn't come.
[01:22:35.781 --> 01:22:37.362]  We really don't know what we're doing here.
[01:22:37.742 --> 01:22:40.323]  And now we're stuck at this facility with 10,000 other people.
[01:22:40.804 --> 01:22:45.866]  And they're saying they're going to fly us over here to Portland or fly us over here to Salt Lake or Vegas or Chicago or Dallas.
[01:22:45.906 --> 01:22:47.947]  And we really have no idea what we're going to do.
[01:22:48.407 --> 01:22:52.149]  And whatever cash or debit cards they give them, eventually you're going to run out.
[01:22:52.629 --> 01:22:54.970]  So I'm not sure what these people are being promised.
[01:22:56.030 --> 01:22:57.771]  And so we're going to try to talk to some of them.
[01:22:57.811 --> 01:22:59.932]  Like I said, when we talk to them, there's a language barrier.
[01:22:59.972 --> 01:23:01.252]  Some of them don't even speak Spanish.
[01:23:01.532 --> 01:23:03.213]  I mean, some of us understand some Spanish.
[01:23:03.233 --> 01:23:04.313]  Well, let's make no mistake.
[01:23:04.353 --> 01:23:06.354]  They're releasing people on average every seven hours.
[01:23:06.834 --> 01:23:07.574]  It's only going to get worse.
[01:23:07.594 --> 01:23:11.916]  They're going to be disgorging millions, if it's hundreds of thousands, every few weeks now.
[01:23:12.516 --> 01:23:13.956]  And again, this is against the law.
[01:23:14.076 --> 01:23:14.676]  It's criminal.
[01:23:14.757 --> 01:23:15.837]  The smugglers are involved.
[01:23:16.197 --> 01:23:17.177]  Children are being exploited.
[01:23:17.197 --> 01:23:18.138]  It happened under Obama.
[01:23:18.398 --> 01:23:20.218]  This is at least 10 times, 20 times bigger.
[01:23:21.159 --> 01:23:21.859]  This is history.
[01:23:22.459 --> 01:23:23.919]  And again, there's such a media blackout.
[01:23:23.939 --> 01:23:26.220]  Like you said, there's almost no media down there.
[01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:28.341]  You saw, like, one satellite truck, Owen.
[01:23:29.741 --> 01:23:31.301]  I saw one satellite truck.
[01:23:31.362 --> 01:23:34.382]  I saw a French... The satellite truck, by the way, didn't do anything, Alex.
[01:23:34.422 --> 01:23:35.083]  It was just parked.
[01:23:35.243 --> 01:23:37.663]  They never even turned their cameras on or launched their satellite.
[01:23:38.103 --> 01:23:42.044]  There was one French journalist who just shot some B-roll for, like, 30 seconds at the facility.
[01:23:42.545 --> 01:23:46.846]  And then, um, there was one other team that was out here on the border yesterday, but that's it.
[01:23:47.366 --> 01:23:47.726]  That's it.
[01:23:47.766 --> 01:23:48.706]  That's all we've seen.
[01:23:49.446 --> 01:23:51.087]  And it just goes to show you that
[01:23:52.065 --> 01:23:54.166]  For whatever reason, there's just no media interest.
[01:23:54.186 --> 01:23:55.307]  I can't understand why.
[01:23:55.367 --> 01:23:58.769]  Maybe they're, you know, afraid of, you know, being labeled something.
[01:23:59.809 --> 01:24:01.390]  But this is a massive story.
[01:24:01.430 --> 01:24:03.211]  This should be the number one story in America.
[01:24:03.571 --> 01:24:07.013]  I understand there's all kinds of stuff going on with the vaccines and the fake pandemic.
[01:24:07.033 --> 01:24:09.554]  And we'll continue to talk about that and the censorship.
[01:24:09.574 --> 01:24:11.575]  But I mean, this is this is inevitable collapse.
[01:24:11.595 --> 01:24:12.856]  This is the U.N.
[01:24:13.056 --> 01:24:14.597]  assaulting the United States.
[01:24:14.657 --> 01:24:15.137]  Stay there.
[01:24:15.157 --> 01:24:16.678]  Do five more minutes with us.
[01:24:16.978 --> 01:24:18.799]  And then you're going to be hosting a lot from the road.
[01:24:19.300 --> 01:24:21.085]  On the War Room today, 3 to 6 p.m.
[01:24:21.125 --> 01:24:21.446]  Central.
[01:24:21.927 --> 01:24:25.577]  Folks, we cannot pay for this, pay for the boats, pay for the security.
[01:24:27.355 --> 01:24:31.358]  We cannot do all this without your support, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:24:32.139 --> 01:24:33.880]  And so, we'll continue to fight on.
[01:24:33.940 --> 01:24:35.902]  We're expending all of our capital doing this.
[01:24:36.322 --> 01:24:42.146]  You know, hiring really good quality paramilitary protection, boats, helicopters, airplanes.
[01:24:42.186 --> 01:24:42.807]  I'm gonna leave it at that.
[01:24:43.307 --> 01:24:46.349]  James O'Keefe is in studio tomorrow.
[01:24:46.730 --> 01:24:53.195]  He's moving down here to cover the story, not full-time, but I mean, he's moved down here to cover the story for a certain period of time.
[01:24:54.781 --> 01:24:57.482]  This is all insane, and we're not going to back down.
[01:24:57.822 --> 01:25:04.904]  We have one of the few outlets, Man.Video, Infowars.com, over 200 radio stations, over 100 TV stations, and cable stations that are telling the truth.
[01:25:04.944 --> 01:25:10.186]  But it takes money to find the satellite uplinks, the servers, the boom operators, the crew, the legal, all of it.
[01:25:10.206 --> 01:25:11.106]  So we're under attack.
[01:25:11.406 --> 01:25:14.947]  We're asking for your support like Colonel Travis did at the Alamo.
[01:25:15.047 --> 01:25:16.168]  And if it doesn't come, that's fine.
[01:25:16.188 --> 01:25:16.888]  We're going to fight on.
[01:25:18.069 --> 01:25:18.469]  To the end.
[01:25:39.814 --> 01:25:42.757]  The books, the films, the endgame came back into stock.
[01:25:42.777 --> 01:25:43.718]  It's almost sold out again.
[01:25:44.158 --> 01:25:45.319]  Infowarscore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:25:45.359 --> 01:25:47.501]  From the tip of the spear, this is the Infowar!
[01:25:53.319 --> 01:25:55.920]  All right, folks, Owen is live on the Rio Grande.
[01:25:56.281 --> 01:25:56.981]  He's a great guy.
[01:25:57.021 --> 01:25:57.541]  So is the crew.
[01:25:57.561 --> 01:26:02.024]  They're just sitting ducks out there with all the government on the sides that were threatening Senator Cruz and more.
[01:26:02.344 --> 01:26:07.967]  We have five minutes left with you, Owen, then an hour or two until your transmission kicks off at 3 p.m.
[01:26:08.367 --> 01:26:08.747]  Central.
[01:26:08.767 --> 01:26:13.270]  What other key points you want to add there from the Texas Rio Grande, U.N.
[01:26:13.310 --> 01:26:15.551]  invasion point, war zone?
[01:26:17.096 --> 01:26:26.027]  Well, if people want to know how bad it's going to get, take a look at the facility in Donna that we were at yesterday that has now basically quadrupled in size.
[01:26:26.428 --> 01:26:35.099]  So 90 days, not even 90 days into the Biden administration, I don't even think it's been 90 days, the facility that they had to set up in Donna, Texas, which was the Donna base camp,
[01:26:35.399 --> 01:26:39.002]  Which we see all the footage of them being totally overcrowded, stacked up like sardines.
[01:26:39.403 --> 01:26:40.243]  They've expanded it.
[01:26:40.303 --> 01:26:42.345]  It's almost quadrupled in size.
[01:26:42.665 --> 01:26:45.568]  So, I mean, that just shows you where this is going to go, Alex.
[01:26:45.928 --> 01:26:51.733]  It's only going to exponentially get worse and worse and worse and worse until either we just totally collapse.
[01:26:52.373 --> 01:26:54.395]  Or somebody wants to do something about it.
[01:26:54.755 --> 01:26:56.277]  Obviously the White House isn't interested.
[01:26:56.517 --> 01:26:58.519]  They seem to like the collapse of the United States.
[01:26:58.559 --> 01:27:00.861]  They seem to like the collapse of the southern border.
[01:27:00.881 --> 01:27:03.663]  So we're going to have more coming up from the Donna facility.
[01:27:03.683 --> 01:27:07.887]  We're going to have more coming up on the envelopes that are being handed out to all these people.
[01:27:08.107 --> 01:27:10.269]  We've got exclusive footage and reports coming up.
[01:27:10.669 --> 01:27:18.694]  From the bus station in McAllen that just shows how this is a well-oiled machine, how it's well-funded, well-organized, and working like clockwork.
[01:27:18.994 --> 01:27:19.855]  When is it going to stop?
[01:27:20.215 --> 01:27:20.935]  When is enough enough?
[01:27:21.175 --> 01:27:22.316]  What is the cap number?
[01:27:22.536 --> 01:27:24.457]  When do we say we've had enough people come across?
[01:27:24.698 --> 01:27:26.058]  When do we say we can't have anymore?
[01:27:26.299 --> 01:27:31.181]  When do Americans say, hey wait, I can't live, I can't get a job, I can't work, I don't get a stimulus check.
[01:27:31.482 --> 01:27:32.662]  How come they're getting all this money?
[01:27:32.702 --> 01:27:33.823]  How come they're getting plane tickets?
[01:27:34.043 --> 01:27:35.204]  How come they're getting bus tickets?
[01:27:35.604 --> 01:27:37.125]  When are we going to wake up?
[01:27:37.185 --> 01:27:39.025]  When are Americans going to take this seriously?
[01:27:39.045 --> 01:27:40.566]  Hopefully it's not too late.
[01:27:40.806 --> 01:27:44.327]  Because at this rate, it'll be a facility in Donna.
[01:27:44.387 --> 01:27:45.807]  It'll be a facility everywhere.
[01:27:45.827 --> 01:27:47.728]  It'll be a facility in every border town.
[01:27:48.088 --> 01:27:49.749]  Every bus stop.
[01:27:49.769 --> 01:27:52.810]  This is a repeat of the UN plan of the last 10 years.
[01:27:52.910 --> 01:27:55.690]  They admit we showed the documents.
[01:27:55.710 --> 01:27:58.051]  This is a UN assault, period.
[01:27:58.351 --> 01:27:59.472]  Our country is under 21st century war.
[01:28:02.011 --> 01:28:03.192]  That's exactly it, Alex.
[01:28:03.653 --> 01:28:08.418]  And until people want to take this seriously and call it out for what it is, nothing is going to stop it.
[01:28:08.679 --> 01:28:10.801]  And again, I don't want to be the big exclusive group.
[01:28:10.861 --> 01:28:12.003]  I'm glad Ted Cruz went.
[01:28:12.063 --> 01:28:13.865]  I'm glad that Trump's going.
[01:28:14.125 --> 01:28:16.668]  But as for media, no one's even reporting on this.
[01:28:17.209 --> 01:28:20.593]  I mean, people talk about it, but it's much worse once you're down there.
[01:28:22.014 --> 01:28:34.848]  Well, I think it's just we've become so numb to having an immigration problem, we've become so numb to knowing that there's, you know, 30 million illegal immigrants in the United States, that we just kind of thumb our nose and just say, yeah, that's just normal business.
[01:28:35.188 --> 01:28:36.750]  This is not normal business.
[01:28:36.810 --> 01:28:38.592]  This is something else entirely.
[01:28:39.133 --> 01:28:42.977]  This is, this is so well organized and well funded and it's so criminal, Alex.
[01:28:43.557 --> 01:28:44.938]  This is beyond the pale.
[01:28:45.279 --> 01:28:48.821]  And so I don't know what it's going to take for Americans to realize how serious it is down here.
[01:28:49.122 --> 01:28:53.605]  Maybe some of the footage and the reports that we're filing, people, share them, please, from Bandop Video.
[01:28:53.865 --> 01:28:54.566]  Well, exactly.
[01:28:54.586 --> 01:29:02.752]  The only way Big Tech gets away with this, the COVID hoax, the open border, the invasion, is suppressing everyone, including Ted Cruz.
[01:29:03.113 --> 01:29:05.715]  And so the Republicans let them get this upper hand.
[01:29:06.135 --> 01:29:08.559]  Now we're in deep trouble, but they're going to lose in the end.
[01:29:09.060 --> 01:29:11.463]  Everybody has to share the reports from Bandot Video.
[01:29:11.884 --> 01:29:13.346]  Everybody has to share those.
[01:29:13.647 --> 01:29:15.670]  Copy them, repost them, take our names off.
[01:29:15.770 --> 01:29:16.451]  I don't want credit.
[01:29:16.551 --> 01:29:17.052]  I don't care.
[01:29:17.072 --> 01:29:19.275]  I just want this to get out.
[01:29:21.622 --> 01:29:22.363]  And there's no doubt.
[01:29:22.783 --> 01:29:25.606]  People can't say, oh, there's not envelopes that they're being handed.
[01:29:25.907 --> 01:29:30.191]  People can't say, oh, there's not massive facilities with tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands.
[01:29:30.512 --> 01:29:33.174]  People can't say, oh, they're not illegally crossing en masse.
[01:29:33.415 --> 01:29:35.897]  People can't say, oh, it's not funded and organized.
[01:29:36.137 --> 01:29:38.100]  People can't say, oh, they're not busting them in.
[01:29:38.140 --> 01:29:39.641]  They're not flying them in on planes.
[01:29:39.982 --> 01:29:40.182]  No.
[01:29:40.562 --> 01:29:44.026]  We've fought it all in 24 hours in one border town.
[01:29:44.426 --> 01:29:46.008]  In one border town.
[01:29:46.208 --> 01:29:47.349]  And this is in Texas, Alice.
[01:29:47.729 --> 01:29:53.294]  Here's another little exclusive bit for you that we found out talking to some border patrol here and some state troopers.
[01:29:53.855 --> 01:29:57.938]  The Biden administration has told border patrol to stand down.
[01:29:58.318 --> 01:29:59.439]  To stand down.
[01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:05.365]  So the governor of Texas, Governor Abbott, had to send state troopers down here to defend our border.
[01:30:06.553 --> 01:30:09.375]  So there is a directive from D.C.
[01:30:09.816 --> 01:30:11.857]  to stand down from federal law enforcement.
[01:30:11.978 --> 01:30:12.298]  That's right.
[01:30:12.338 --> 01:30:13.939]  Let's talk about that.
[01:30:13.959 --> 01:30:19.424]  The globalists want internal checkpoints and total control for COVID and COVID passports, but they want the border.
[01:30:20.084 --> 01:30:23.327]  They want TSA for us, but not for the illegals because they want to exploit them.
[01:30:23.667 --> 01:30:24.288]  Owen, great job.
[01:30:24.308 --> 01:30:25.269]  You're going to be hosting
[01:30:25.989 --> 01:30:30.012]  For three hours live on the road with Tom Papert and others today, 3 to 6 p.m.
[01:30:30.032 --> 01:30:34.835]  Central, The War Room at InfoWars.com, board slash show and band dot video on The War Room.
[01:30:34.855 --> 01:30:38.598]  And we've now created the Border Crisis page where all your incredible reports.
[01:30:38.778 --> 01:30:40.799]  Hey, I'll let you do whatever you want.
[01:30:41.059 --> 01:30:43.141]  If the crew wants to stay on there all week, just do it.
[01:30:43.621 --> 01:30:44.622]  But it's all up to you.
[01:30:44.682 --> 01:30:45.562]  You are in charge.
[01:30:45.602 --> 01:30:46.183]  It's your mission.
[01:30:46.523 --> 01:30:47.964]  If you choose to accept it, which you have.
[01:30:48.264 --> 01:30:49.845]  We'll be right back with our next big guest.
[01:30:49.885 --> 01:30:52.487]  Pray for Owen and the rest of the crew, because they're in a dangerous situation.
[01:30:53.203 --> 01:30:54.623]  Because that's what Americans do now.
[01:30:54.783 --> 01:31:01.665]  They're always willing to trade away a little of their freedom in exchange for the feeling, the illusion of security.
[01:31:01.925 --> 01:31:12.627]  What we have now is a completely neurotic population obsessed with security and safety and crime and drugs and cleanliness and hygiene and germs.
[01:31:13.007 --> 01:31:13.887]  There's another thing.
[01:31:14.307 --> 01:31:14.807]  Germs.
[01:31:15.207 --> 01:31:17.528]  Where did this sudden fear of germs come from?
[01:31:17.948 --> 01:31:18.588]  In this country.
[01:31:18.628 --> 01:31:19.388]  Have you noticed this?
[01:31:19.728 --> 01:31:37.339]  The media, constantly running stories about all the latest infections, Salmonella, E. coli, Hantavirus, bird flu, and Americans, they panic easily, so now everybody's running around, scrubbing this and spraying that, and overcooking their food, and repeatedly washing their hands, trying to avoid all contact with germs.
[01:31:37.700 --> 01:31:40.661]  It's ridiculous, and it goes to ridiculous lengths.
[01:31:41.142 --> 01:31:42.182]  Fear it, germs!
[01:31:42.242 --> 01:31:44.364]  Why, these f***ing p***ies!
[01:31:45.782 --> 01:31:47.404]  Hey, where's your sense of adventure?
[01:31:47.484 --> 01:31:49.005]  Take a f***ing chance, will you?
[01:31:50.086 --> 01:31:53.230]  Besides, what do you think you have an immune system for?
[01:31:53.750 --> 01:31:55.151]  It's for killing germs!
[01:31:55.712 --> 01:31:56.793]  But it needs practice.
[01:31:57.113 --> 01:31:58.995]  It needs germs to practice on.
[01:31:59.015 --> 01:32:02.379]  So, so listen.
[01:32:03.860 --> 01:32:04.361]  So listen.
[01:32:06.556 --> 01:32:13.237]  If you kill all the germs around you and live a completely sterile life, then when germs do come along, you're not going to be prepared.
[01:32:13.478 --> 01:32:21.559]  And never mind ordinary germs, what are you going to do when some super virus comes along that turns your vital organs into liquid sh**?
[01:32:21.599 --> 01:32:28.181]  I'll tell you what you're going to do, you're going to get sick, you're going to die, and you're going to deserve it because you're f***ing weak and you got a f***ing weak immune system.
[01:32:34.963 --> 01:32:38.165]  Let me tell you a true story about immunization, okay?
[01:32:38.405 --> 01:32:45.590]  When I was a little boy in New York City in the 1940s, we swam in the Hudson River, and it was filled with raw sewage.
[01:32:45.890 --> 01:32:46.270]  Okay?
[01:32:46.791 --> 01:32:48.552]  We swam in raw sewage.
[01:32:48.952 --> 01:32:50.293]  You know, to cool off!
[01:32:52.534 --> 01:32:54.656]  And at that time, the big fear was polio.
[01:32:54.876 --> 01:32:57.057]  Thousands of kids died from polio every year.
[01:32:57.157 --> 01:32:57.818]  But you know something?
[01:32:58.018 --> 01:33:00.159]  In my neighborhood, no one ever got polio.
[01:33:00.259 --> 01:33:00.760]  No one.
[01:33:00.960 --> 01:33:01.200]  Ever.
[01:33:01.440 --> 01:33:01.980]  You know why?
[01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.182]  Because we swam in raw sewage!
[01:33:05.723 --> 01:33:07.845]  It strengthened our immune systems.
[01:33:08.205 --> 01:33:09.726]  The polio never had a prayer.
[01:33:09.766 --> 01:33:11.548]  We were tempered in raw sh**.
[01:33:23.518 --> 01:33:26.681]  George Carlin warned us about the COVID panic years ago.
[01:33:26.701 --> 01:33:27.481]  It's at Band.Video.
[01:33:30.256 --> 01:33:32.237]  The miscellaneous videos section.
[01:33:32.457 --> 01:33:34.438]  What a ridiculous title section, but whatever.
[01:33:34.498 --> 01:33:34.859]  It's there.
[01:33:34.879 --> 01:33:36.359]  We need to get it out.
[01:33:36.700 --> 01:33:37.700]  Call it hot videos.
[01:33:38.561 --> 01:33:39.401]  Original videos.
[01:33:39.661 --> 01:33:40.682]  Miscellaneous videos.
[01:33:41.182 --> 01:33:44.584]  Gregory Manorino is a successful stockbroker, author.
[01:33:45.004 --> 01:33:48.506]  We really appreciate him coming on the broadcast with us.
[01:33:49.166 --> 01:33:52.188]  Gregory Manorino on YouTube and traderschoice.net.
[01:33:52.688 --> 01:33:57.211]  And I want to get him on about the market and the bubbles and where he sees it going.
[01:33:57.711 --> 01:34:00.473]  But he wants to get into replacement migration and the U.N.
[01:34:00.793 --> 01:34:17.063]  and the open borders, what we were just covering with Owen Schroyer from the Texas-Mexico border, or what was the Texas-Mexico border, and our Commander-in-Chief, our puppet chief, the election thief, Joe Biden, saying that, just come on up, just rush the border.
[01:34:17.483 --> 01:34:19.905]  What's really going on here in your view, Gregory?
[01:34:21.548 --> 01:34:23.511]  Alex, it's really an incredible thing.
[01:34:23.551 --> 01:34:26.174]  Number one, let's not give Joe Biden too much credit.
[01:34:26.554 --> 01:34:28.998]  The man cannot walk and chew gum at the same time.
[01:34:29.298 --> 01:34:30.700]  He's not pulling the strings.
[01:34:31.340 --> 01:34:33.383]  Nobody in this administration is.
[01:34:33.864 --> 01:34:36.227]  This is the new world
[01:34:36.787 --> 01:34:38.267]  Order what they are doing here.
[01:34:38.587 --> 01:34:40.848]  They're creating a prison planet.
[01:34:40.888 --> 01:34:41.928]  Does that sound familiar?
[01:34:42.008 --> 01:34:44.349]  It should that's you there's a hundred percent.
[01:34:44.669 --> 01:34:51.770]  They are creating by design a slave Society, this is way beyond the United States.
[01:34:51.790 --> 01:34:56.591]  This is a global phenomenon who has the power to do it I mean, it's very very simple.
[01:34:56.651 --> 01:34:59.012]  Let's look at what they have done to us already Alex.
[01:34:59.032 --> 01:35:06.213]  It's an incredible situation What other mechanism could have possibly been used other than a scam demic?
[01:35:06.753 --> 01:35:15.256]  To shut down the global economy, kill the money velocity, which would allow the central banks to buy it all.
[01:35:15.637 --> 01:35:16.797]  This is what they're doing.
[01:35:16.937 --> 01:35:19.238]  The banks run the world.
[01:35:19.538 --> 01:35:20.659]  They call the shots.
[01:35:20.959 --> 01:35:24.520]  The central banks are working in concert to dollarize the world.
[01:35:25.020 --> 01:35:27.101]  They're the ones who are pulling the string.
[01:35:27.181 --> 01:35:29.562]  It's not Biden who can't walk and chew gum at the same time.
[01:35:30.022 --> 01:35:34.624]  This whole mechanism has been put in place a long, long time.
[01:35:34.904 --> 01:35:40.566]  Exactly, and the UN and Globalist said even 10 years ago at Davos, we want puppets that really aren't presidents.
[01:35:40.686 --> 01:35:42.726]  We want the technocrats to run things.
[01:35:43.026 --> 01:35:46.968]  And they said, like Bloomberg, like David Rockefeller, was in that particular article.
[01:35:47.008 --> 01:35:50.909]  So we're getting a shot to actually see what this looks like right now.
[01:35:51.209 --> 01:35:54.410]  And their whole system is based on them never getting the blame.
[01:35:55.891 --> 01:35:58.715]  Well, of course, because they lurk in the shadows.
[01:35:58.915 --> 01:35:59.476]  Absolutely.
[01:35:59.496 --> 01:36:02.800]  You know, they put up this puppet government, okay?
[01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:05.724]  Okay, people, this is who you have to pay attention to.
[01:36:05.784 --> 01:36:06.985]  It's all garbage.
[01:36:07.005 --> 01:36:08.707]  They're not the ones pulling the strings.
[01:36:08.968 --> 01:36:11.951]  Their strings are being pulled, and they're going to do whatever they got to do here.
[01:36:11.991 --> 01:36:12.152]  Look.
[01:36:12.993 --> 01:36:14.514]  It's just an incredible situation.
[01:36:14.534 --> 01:36:19.760]  We've got to step back, all of us, and understand who the real government is.
[01:36:20.100 --> 01:36:25.586]  The real government is those that are issuing the currency, that run the financial system.
[01:36:25.646 --> 01:36:27.028]  The rest of it is nonsense.
[01:36:27.328 --> 01:36:28.229]  It's garbage.
[01:36:28.469 --> 01:36:30.051]  We're looking in the wrong places.
[01:36:31.412 --> 01:36:38.000]  If we realize who the real enemy is, the New World Order is playing the world, not just the United States.
[01:36:38.260 --> 01:36:40.843]  So of course they want to flood the world with immigrants.
[01:36:41.083 --> 01:36:45.649]  They want to create this society of slaves here in the United States because we're the hub.
[01:36:46.229 --> 01:36:48.890]  The United States is the hub where this is all happening.
[01:36:49.150 --> 01:36:51.151]  We're the largest economy in the world.
[01:36:51.431 --> 01:36:54.412]  This is encircling the world at this particular time.
[01:36:54.852 --> 01:36:58.113]  Central banks are buying it all, Alex.
[01:36:58.153 --> 01:37:01.574]  The Federal Reserve's balance sheet has gone up over a million times.
[01:37:06.836 --> 01:37:14.058]  Oh no, you know, all the real inflation is in these derivatives and in all these banks' money because they're idiots.
[01:37:14.138 --> 01:37:17.340]  No, they're using that to buy up all the companies, all the real systems.
[01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:20.881]  I know because they took us off over 60 companies three years ago.
[01:37:21.281 --> 01:37:22.821]  We've been on a bunch of other companies.
[01:37:22.841 --> 01:37:25.482]  They always buy them and throw us off on a weekly basis.
[01:37:25.502 --> 01:37:27.223]  We're like jumping to the next company.
[01:37:27.243 --> 01:37:31.664]  We're having to build everything ourselves now because we're always jumping to the next company because they have all this limited money.
[01:37:31.684 --> 01:37:33.265]  They're buying up all the companies!
[01:37:34.343 --> 01:37:38.706]  They're buying everything, Alex, and they shut down the global economy by design.
[01:37:38.726 --> 01:37:46.251]  And of course, there's all these variants that are popping up now that the vaccine that was supposed to save the world isn't even going to work anyway.
[01:37:46.311 --> 01:37:47.292]  Look what they're doing.
[01:37:47.312 --> 01:37:48.833]  They're propagating fear.
[01:37:48.873 --> 01:37:50.174]  They're mind twisting people.
[01:37:50.214 --> 01:37:51.155]  This is a sign up.
[01:37:51.215 --> 01:37:52.496]  You know this better than anybody.
[01:37:52.696 --> 01:37:54.497]  Your followers know this better than anyone.
[01:37:54.537 --> 01:38:00.121]  This is so twisted and it goes so far beyond, I think, what most people can comprehend.
[01:38:00.161 --> 01:38:03.904]  Whether it's whether it's aliens, the devil, whatever you want to call it, there's a thing wants us dead.
[01:38:05.390 --> 01:38:07.158]  This is a global...
[01:38:07.990 --> 01:38:08.610]  Take over.
[01:38:08.811 --> 01:38:13.453]  They set this up a long time ago, and now we're watching the effects of it.
[01:38:13.493 --> 01:38:18.316]  And you said something earlier that just stuck in my head, and I'm gonna agree with you 100%.
[01:38:18.416 --> 01:38:22.319]  What we're seeing right now, we haven't even seen anything yet.
[01:38:22.639 --> 01:38:25.421]  This is about to get monumentally worse moving forward.
[01:38:25.581 --> 01:38:26.821]  And I'll tell you what makes me sick.
[01:38:27.142 --> 01:38:30.504]  There are people out here that like the current situation.
[01:38:30.744 --> 01:38:33.706]  They want to be slaves to the government that's developing itself.
[01:38:33.766 --> 01:38:34.746]  It's unbelievable here.
[01:38:34.786 --> 01:38:35.647]  There are people like you.
[01:38:36.187 --> 01:38:36.567]  And me.
[01:38:36.867 --> 01:38:39.728]  And the people that are listening to this show who say, no, no, no.
[01:38:39.988 --> 01:38:41.649]  This is not the way it's supposed to go.
[01:38:41.689 --> 01:38:45.851]  But what really scares me, Alex, is there are people out there that want this.
[01:38:45.911 --> 01:38:47.891]  They want to be taken care of from cradle to grave.
[01:38:47.911 --> 01:38:49.332]  They want those government checks.
[01:38:49.372 --> 01:38:52.593]  And they're so dumb, they don't know that all that's ending in the Globalist on white papers.
[01:38:52.793 --> 01:38:54.434]  Did you see the AP article, Dear Normal?
[01:38:55.054 --> 01:38:56.496]  Were you really that great in the first place?
[01:38:56.576 --> 01:39:00.281]  It says we must all stay in our houses for the carbon taxes and never leave again.
[01:39:00.301 --> 01:39:02.524]  It actually says we suckered you, but it's good.
[01:39:02.904 --> 01:39:03.985]  And now just stay in your home.
[01:39:04.066 --> 01:39:04.666]  I mean, wow.
[01:39:04.686 --> 01:39:06.108]  I mean, what a cult of freaks.
[01:39:07.334 --> 01:39:12.416]  They got a boot on the throat of the people of the world and they're going to push it harder.
[01:39:12.776 --> 01:39:14.097]  There is no doubt about it.
[01:39:14.137 --> 01:39:18.558]  We are in the middle of the creation of something I've warned about for over a decade.
[01:39:18.578 --> 01:39:20.759]  The creation of a two-tier society.
[01:39:20.839 --> 01:39:23.060]  Extreme haves, extreme have-nots.
[01:39:23.340 --> 01:39:25.801]  The middle class is being systematically wiped out.
[01:39:26.201 --> 01:39:26.841]  Erased.
[01:39:26.941 --> 01:39:27.561]  They're gone.
[01:39:28.062 --> 01:39:29.822]  And this is all by design.
[01:39:30.002 --> 01:39:32.663]  Nothing that we are seeing here is by accident.
[01:39:32.683 --> 01:39:33.503]  The Scandemic.
[01:39:33.523 --> 01:39:35.504]  The ship getting wedged in the Suez Canal.
[01:39:35.604 --> 01:39:37.284]  All your refineries exploding here.
[01:39:37.304 --> 01:39:38.985]  I told people it was going to happen and it did.
[01:39:39.005 --> 01:39:41.926]  It's all by design and nothing is what it seems.
[01:39:41.946 --> 01:39:42.266]  That's right.
[01:39:42.286 --> 01:39:47.688]  You were on a couple times ago and I remember seeing one of your videos where you said look for oil shortages, look for sabotage.
[01:39:47.728 --> 01:39:48.628]  How did you see that coming?
[01:39:49.522 --> 01:39:50.383]  Oh, there's no doubt about it.
[01:39:50.403 --> 01:39:51.184]  Look what they're going to do.
[01:39:51.465 --> 01:39:55.150]  OK, crude oil is the lifeblood of the military-industrial complex.
[01:39:55.210 --> 01:39:57.172]  I don't think people really understand that.
[01:39:58.394 --> 01:40:01.318]  The investment banks have trillions of dollars.
[01:40:02.348 --> 01:40:04.590]  Uh, invested in crude oil.
[01:40:04.630 --> 01:40:06.371]  They will make sure it stays propped up.
[01:40:06.391 --> 01:40:09.933]  They must keep crude oil propped up because it- Oh, you gotta go to break.
[01:40:09.953 --> 01:40:11.234]  Stay right there, Gregory.
[01:40:11.254 --> 01:40:12.755]  We're gonna come back with Gregory Manorino.
[01:40:13.096 --> 01:40:14.196]  On the other side, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:40:14.256 --> 01:40:14.937]  He's a smart guy.
[01:40:14.977 --> 01:40:16.358]  This is all really happening.
[01:40:16.658 --> 01:40:24.223]  And I can tell you intellectually, scientifically, but also at a gut level, I am literally telling you all hell's gonna break loose.
[01:40:24.564 --> 01:40:25.124]  I'm sorry.
[01:40:25.144 --> 01:40:26.065]  I'm not trying to be glum and dim.
[01:40:26.105 --> 01:40:27.626]  I'm warning you so you know.
[01:40:28.467 --> 01:40:30.711]  Like he said, hell is being released.
[01:40:30.912 --> 01:40:32.034]  You've seen nothing yet.
[01:40:32.255 --> 01:40:33.838]  They're going to collapse the whole third world.
[01:40:34.139 --> 01:40:35.382]  Hundreds of millions starving to death.
[01:40:35.682 --> 01:40:36.384]  It's already happened.
[01:40:36.404 --> 01:40:37.606]  The lockdown already did it.
[01:40:38.840 --> 01:40:49.549]  I'll tell you, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm a pretty tough guy, and I can handle a lot of stress, and I've been around the block a couple times, but I shake at my very core at what's coming down.
[01:40:50.170 --> 01:40:55.875]  The Satanism, the devil-worshipping, the evil, the killing of babies, the selling of their organs.
[01:40:55.915 --> 01:41:00.139]  I saw a stack of articles yesterday where a bunch of states keep babies alive, sell their organs.
[01:41:00.179 --> 01:41:02.501]  I mean, this is just beyond Satanism.
[01:41:03.752 --> 01:41:11.358]  This is the end of our species and then open illegal aliens and waving law without law and just shipping kids into smugglers.
[01:41:12.579 --> 01:41:15.441]  This is corrupting our military, our police, our border patrol.
[01:41:15.481 --> 01:41:17.082]  This is just the beginning.
[01:41:17.983 --> 01:41:19.864]  And so they are preparing us for full collapse.
[01:41:19.884 --> 01:41:20.785]  They want us out of the way.
[01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:33.209]  And I see the left with that satanic America hate in their eyes, feeling like they're becoming something because they're about to conquer the republic when it's the republic that made them so spoiled and pathetic.
[01:41:33.509 --> 01:41:36.792]  It's almost, well it is, there's justice to it.
[01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:44.985]  But we need to be here on air so that those that are not on their knees of the devil have a chance to get ready and prepared.
[01:41:45.025 --> 01:41:56.612]  So please continue with our guest here, TradersChoice.net, Gregory Manorino, stock trader, researcher, smart guy, with what's coming next, what you expect to unfold.
[01:41:56.652 --> 01:42:01.755]  Because I agree with you, this is just the beginning of the end, not the end of the end.
[01:42:01.775 --> 01:42:05.437]  Alex, you know, I hope people are listening to you.
[01:42:06.300 --> 01:42:10.791]  We are on the precipice of a major event here.
[01:42:11.513 --> 01:42:15.021]  We are watching things unfold in a way that allows us to see
[01:42:16.483 --> 01:42:17.963]  What's going to come down the pike here?
[01:42:17.983 --> 01:42:24.045]  And this is why I've been and you have been so accurate with what we've said in the past and we've seen it happen here.
[01:42:24.445 --> 01:42:26.446]  What we're what this is leading up to again.
[01:42:26.486 --> 01:42:27.386]  What are they trying to do?
[01:42:27.826 --> 01:42:31.187]  They're trying to create a slave state on a global scale.
[01:42:31.648 --> 01:42:32.568]  It's not just America.
[01:42:32.588 --> 01:42:36.949]  This is this is a global event here that we are witnessing here starting with the scandamic here.
[01:42:37.289 --> 01:42:42.971]  This is a an event here unlike anything we've ever seen and they will keep this going until
[01:42:43.835 --> 01:42:46.538]  Until whenever they want to, and then they get to pull the plug.
[01:42:46.598 --> 01:42:50.942]  And when they pull that plug, we're going to end up in a situation so dire.
[01:42:50.962 --> 01:42:54.146]  I have said this, people are going to eat each other in the streets.
[01:42:54.266 --> 01:42:56.148]  We're talking about absolute pandemonium.
[01:42:56.388 --> 01:43:00.172]  They will use every excuse to issue in a police statement.
[01:43:00.192 --> 01:43:01.413]  That's happened in Venezuela.
[01:43:01.433 --> 01:43:03.555]  They ate the zoo animals six, seven years ago.
[01:43:03.856 --> 01:43:05.137]  They ate their own animals three years ago.
[01:43:05.197 --> 01:43:05.878]  Now they eat each other.
[01:43:07.260 --> 01:43:08.041]  It's a horrible thing.
[01:43:08.061 --> 01:43:10.404]  So this is a setup here for what's coming down the pike.
[01:43:10.724 --> 01:43:13.427]  We have a stock market here pretty much at all-time record high.
[01:43:13.467 --> 01:43:16.510]  Yesterday we hit the Dow Jones Industrial Average at yet another record high.
[01:43:16.811 --> 01:43:20.535]  We're in a free-fall economic collapse right now.
[01:43:20.635 --> 01:43:22.857]  Meanwhile, the market keeps going higher.
[01:43:23.177 --> 01:43:24.879]  Easy money being pumped into the market.
[01:43:24.899 --> 01:43:26.381]  Suppression of interest rates here.
[01:43:27.241 --> 01:43:28.662]  Debts and deficits ballooning.
[01:43:28.702 --> 01:43:35.166]  This pattern here is leading towards a cataclysmic event in the financial markets that's going to hit the globe.
[01:43:35.566 --> 01:43:40.449]  And when this does, it's going to transfer wealth from one group of people to another.
[01:43:40.749 --> 01:43:48.293]  And then the middle class, whatever's left of it, these paper millionaires, they're going to sit there and go, going, what is going on here?
[01:43:48.353 --> 01:43:53.296]  Again, it's the creation of a two-tier society and a wipe out of the middle class.
[01:43:53.596 --> 01:43:54.037]  We're going
[01:44:11.232 --> 01:44:12.053]  I'm good to go.
[01:44:28.953 --> 01:44:30.574]  It's not the freak show.
[01:44:30.834 --> 01:44:33.175]  It's not, look over here at these people or look at these people.
[01:44:33.275 --> 01:44:34.636]  No, it's the banks.
[01:44:34.716 --> 01:44:36.176]  They run the show.
[01:44:36.216 --> 01:44:37.457]  They run the world.
[01:44:37.497 --> 01:44:38.858]  They're the puppet masters.
[01:44:39.298 --> 01:44:41.479]  Everything else doesn't matter because they all know what's coming.
[01:44:41.739 --> 01:44:42.799]  They all know it, okay?
[01:44:42.959 --> 01:44:49.202]  The people who don't know it is the regular guy and the regular girl sitting out there on the street who has no idea what's going on.
[01:44:49.242 --> 01:44:54.925]  They're locked in fear, being told to be afraid of this virus or a variant or this or that or that or this.
[01:44:54.945 --> 01:44:55.585]  Look at this guy.
[01:44:55.965 --> 01:44:57.806]  He can't even, you know, Joe Biden here.
[01:44:58.126 --> 01:44:59.947]  The men can't walk and chew gum at the same time!
[01:45:00.328 --> 01:45:01.609]  He's not pulling the strings!
[01:45:01.909 --> 01:45:04.070]  People gotta understand who's really pulling the strings here, Alex.
[01:45:04.110 --> 01:45:04.751]  I'm telling you the truth.
[01:45:06.519 --> 01:45:12.682]  They now admit that he can't, and I totally agree, and they're trying to promote race war with the Federal Reserve saying we want reparations.
[01:45:12.722 --> 01:45:14.463]  They're not going to take care of black people.
[01:45:14.723 --> 01:45:18.145]  They want to be able to activate Black Lives Matter, to tell folks to burn down U.S.
[01:45:18.165 --> 01:45:20.125]  cities, to blame them for the collapse.
[01:45:20.546 --> 01:45:29.450]  They want to use COVID as the excuse and a race war as the excuse of the collapse so the Federal Reserve doesn't get blamed, and they're literally setting black people up to take the fall.
[01:45:30.580 --> 01:45:31.521]  Divide and conquer.
[01:45:31.761 --> 01:45:34.604]  That's the mechanism since beyond beyond.
[01:45:34.644 --> 01:45:35.905]  It's always going to be that way.
[01:45:35.945 --> 01:45:36.866]  Keep people divided.
[01:45:36.906 --> 01:45:43.031]  Don't allow them to to realize that we're not each other's enemies, that we all do need each other and we need to band together.
[01:45:43.051 --> 01:45:44.953]  This is what I'm trying to tell people.
[01:45:45.033 --> 01:45:47.215]  Forget about, you know, the divide and conquer.
[01:45:47.255 --> 01:45:50.958]  Realize how you're being mind twisted in this environment.
[01:45:51.018 --> 01:45:52.679]  It's been going on for quite a while now.
[01:45:52.719 --> 01:45:53.760]  We got to come together.
[01:45:53.800 --> 01:45:56.403]  There are strength in numbers and the more people that we
[01:45:57.123 --> 01:46:25.222]  Can get to understand the situation the better off we're all gonna be because they've got us marching right into a worst case Scenario by design they already shut down my intellectual stuff is strong But my gut is like get a farm literally get armed get ready and move some families in there to protect ourselves I mean, I'm literally I mean my cells are run-of-the-hills run-of-the-hills run-of-the-hills run-of-the-hills It's like red like a helicopter crashing.
[01:46:25.602 --> 01:46:25.802]  I mean
[01:46:27.063 --> 01:46:30.986]  I've never had this much of my, this is 10 times my concern ever right now.
[01:46:32.707 --> 01:46:43.254]  And rightly so, and rightly so, because every single day brings us closer to that moment where this whole fake environment is going to get very, very real.
[01:46:43.534 --> 01:46:45.876]  We don't know when that's going to be, we just know it's coming.
[01:46:45.956 --> 01:46:48.518]  You know, I have those same little senses that you do here.
[01:46:48.938 --> 01:46:51.560]  And my job, and what I've been out here trying to explain to people is,
[01:46:54.202 --> 01:46:55.703]  Absolutely.
[01:46:56.124 --> 01:46:57.905]  We need to have a getaway plan.
[01:46:57.925 --> 01:46:59.527]  We need to band together.
[01:46:59.547 --> 01:47:02.750]  We need to understand again that we're not each other's enemies.
[01:47:02.970 --> 01:47:11.958]  We need to get together with like-minded people and come up with some kind of a plan because this whole thing is going to change rapidly.
[01:47:12.898 --> 01:47:14.979]  And it's not going to be a slow thing at one point.
[01:47:15.159 --> 01:47:20.100]  When this hits again, and this is going to be a time of their choosing, the banks are running the show.
[01:47:20.120 --> 01:47:23.901]  They're going to allow the debt market to go ballistic.
[01:47:23.921 --> 01:47:24.561]  What does that mean?
[01:47:24.841 --> 01:47:25.841]  We're going to have an implosion.
[01:47:25.861 --> 01:47:27.622]  That's why they want universal income all day.
[01:47:27.662 --> 01:47:31.523]  Get everybody totally strung out, totally dependent, blame it on us, and then pull it.
[01:47:32.352 --> 01:47:33.332]  That's exactly what they want.
[01:47:33.392 --> 01:47:34.673]  That's what they're doing right now.
[01:47:34.893 --> 01:47:36.314]  They're creating a slave society.
[01:47:36.334 --> 01:47:37.874]  I've been warning about this for the longest time.
[01:47:37.894 --> 01:47:39.675]  They want a slave-dependent society.
[01:47:39.715 --> 01:47:42.236]  But Alex, the craziest thing is people want it.
[01:47:42.596 --> 01:47:47.138]  Some people I talk to are like, great, I want the government to keep mailing me checks.
[01:47:47.499 --> 01:47:48.959]  You know, you've got to be kidding me.
[01:47:49.279 --> 01:47:51.120]  What happened to a country?
[01:47:51.180 --> 01:47:51.861]  I don't know.
[01:47:51.921 --> 01:47:53.501]  It's Venezuela on a grand scale.
[01:47:53.521 --> 01:47:54.962]  They're not even thinking one step ahead.
[01:47:56.593 --> 01:47:57.634]  No, they're not.
[01:47:57.694 --> 01:47:59.056]  These people, I don't know what's wrong.
[01:47:59.276 --> 01:48:00.779]  They've lost their competitive edge.
[01:48:01.039 --> 01:48:02.100]  I don't know what it is.
[01:48:02.421 --> 01:48:03.362]  They've become worms.
[01:48:03.382 --> 01:48:04.264]  They've become mush.
[01:48:04.604 --> 01:48:06.387]  Their brains have... They're in a trance.
[01:48:06.587 --> 01:48:07.388]  They're in a trance.
[01:48:07.408 --> 01:48:09.150]  Studies show people are in a near dream state.
[01:48:10.246 --> 01:48:12.128]  They've been brainwashed on an epic scale.
[01:48:12.388 --> 01:48:16.351]  And that brainwashing is going to continue because they're keeping the fear level high.
[01:48:16.732 --> 01:48:23.878]  As long as they keep that fear level high with regard to this freaking dogshit, scandemic, new variants that are coming to kill you.
[01:48:23.898 --> 01:48:26.960]  You get the CDC director today saying, I'm scared.
[01:48:27.160 --> 01:48:28.862]  We're going to face a horrible moment.
[01:48:29.042 --> 01:48:29.963]  Look, come on.
[01:48:29.983 --> 01:48:36.128]  They're going to keep the economy shut down by design to allow the central banks to buy it all.
[01:48:36.508 --> 01:48:38.469]  They're buying it all, people!
[01:48:38.789 --> 01:48:40.930]  Give us a time frame, because it's clearly coming to a head.
[01:48:40.970 --> 01:48:46.553]  I know nobody has an exact date set, because the enemy's gauging it and thinking about it, but how do we fight it?
[01:48:46.593 --> 01:48:47.214]  We expose them!
[01:48:47.694 --> 01:48:51.216]  They wouldn't be trying to censor all of us if exposure wasn't hurting them.
[01:48:51.596 --> 01:48:54.737]  All right, traderschoice.net, Gregory Manorino is our guest, really smart guy.
[01:48:55.098 --> 01:49:01.041]  I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com and newswars.com, and I'm telling you this, folks, get ready while you still can.
[01:49:02.216 --> 01:49:14.546]  The globalists are launching hoaxes and criminal activities with big pharma and with borders and with crime syndicates and with islamicists that are 50 times bigger than any crime ever committed.
[01:49:14.586 --> 01:49:15.567]  I mean that conservatively.
[01:49:16.188 --> 01:49:22.012]  They wouldn't be committing crimes that big if they weren't planning something so huge soon, no one will think about what they did before.
[01:49:22.713 --> 01:49:26.936]  That's how they scale up crime, how they scale up wars, how they scale up conflicts.
[01:49:27.637 --> 01:49:30.539]  And nothing's ever been done like this, even before World War I.
[01:49:31.496 --> 01:49:32.237]  World War II.
[01:49:32.677 --> 01:49:37.583]  That's why all these mainline historians are like, this looks like the beginning of World War II and World War I combined.
[01:49:37.803 --> 01:49:38.584]  What's going on here?
[01:49:40.306 --> 01:49:40.527]  Yeah.
[01:49:41.167 --> 01:49:44.972]  So the real technocrats on the top are making their move right now.
[01:49:46.113 --> 01:49:48.155]  And we're not here trying to scare people.
[01:49:48.316 --> 01:49:49.056]  I can tell you
[01:49:51.189 --> 01:49:52.729]  I told the story of probably 500 times.
[01:49:53.610 --> 01:49:54.950]  I'll tell it briefly because it's so important.
[01:49:55.830 --> 01:49:56.891]  16 years ago, I'm in LA.
[01:49:56.951 --> 01:49:58.391]  I'm in a major Hollywood star's house.
[01:49:58.511 --> 01:50:01.632]  A major producer comes by that's household name.
[01:50:02.072 --> 01:50:03.953]  This guy's, you know, top 15 or so.
[01:50:04.893 --> 01:50:07.894]  And that was back when I used to get invited out there and I cared to be in a few movies.
[01:50:07.914 --> 01:50:09.515]  I haven't even been out there in over a decade.
[01:50:09.535 --> 01:50:10.855]  I refuse to be out there because it's so evil.
[01:50:12.771 --> 01:50:15.594]  And he said, yeah, I was just with James Cameron.
[01:50:15.614 --> 01:50:17.075]  He's not really gonna make many movies anymore.
[01:50:17.095 --> 01:50:20.318]  He might make a, you know, a part two of this movie he's got coming out, Avatar.
[01:50:20.338 --> 01:50:21.419]  That's where Avatar came out.
[01:50:22.399 --> 01:50:24.301]  He said he's not gonna make his hologram movie theaters anymore.
[01:50:24.321 --> 01:50:28.305]  He's moving to New Zealand, getting ready basically for the end, the collapse of civilization.
[01:50:28.665 --> 01:50:31.788]  He's got his Navy, not for really, you know, finding ships and stuff.
[01:50:31.808 --> 01:50:33.249]  That's his cover for tax write-offs.
[01:50:33.569 --> 01:50:35.150]  He's got that in case New Zealand falls.
[01:50:36.592 --> 01:50:40.155]  And all the elites are moving to New Zealand, getting ready for this big collapse event.
[01:50:41.109 --> 01:50:42.372]  I talked about that on air.
[01:50:42.532 --> 01:50:49.266]  Then I met with some scientists that said, yeah, they were in on it at a big mansion they had outside Austin because they had patents on some stuff.
[01:50:50.270 --> 01:50:51.291]  These people were billionaires.
[01:50:52.211 --> 01:50:54.013]  And so that's how I know all this is true.
[01:50:54.053 --> 01:51:02.279]  Well, now you read the news, they admit they've all got bases in New Zealand and private airfields and bunkers with robot-controlled machine guns and all this.
[01:51:02.299 --> 01:51:03.620]  They don't even trust their security people.
[01:51:03.640 --> 01:51:04.080]  They shouldn't.
[01:51:04.461 --> 01:51:07.403]  And they're in Kauai building these things and Tasmania building them.
[01:51:07.683 --> 01:51:08.564]  They're all leaving.
[01:51:08.804 --> 01:51:10.445]  They don't even care about making movies anymore.
[01:51:10.886 --> 01:51:12.927]  It's like it's the end of the world as we know it.
[01:51:13.528 --> 01:51:16.570]  So looking at all the pieces we have, Gregory, you're a smart guy.
[01:51:17.010 --> 01:51:17.771]  How does it look?
[01:51:17.911 --> 01:51:18.772]  When do they trigger it?
[01:51:19.793 --> 01:51:25.541]  What is this big event so dangerous that we all kill each other and die and they're going to try to hide out in the Pacific?
[01:51:25.621 --> 01:51:28.265]  I mean, this is definitely something big's coming.
[01:51:28.305 --> 01:51:28.906]  What do you think it is?
[01:51:30.603 --> 01:51:32.244]  Alex, first of all, you're so on point.
[01:51:32.324 --> 01:51:33.605]  It's frightening to hear.
[01:51:33.665 --> 01:51:36.186]  But at the same time, yes, we're not trying to scare people.
[01:51:36.526 --> 01:51:39.308]  What we're trying to do here is raise people's awareness.
[01:51:39.348 --> 01:51:39.908]  That's all.
[01:51:40.389 --> 01:51:43.991]  I explain to people how these markets work and everything connected to it.
[01:51:44.351 --> 01:51:46.252]  And I say to them, don't be afraid.
[01:51:46.752 --> 01:51:48.453]  Look for the opportunities here.
[01:51:48.833 --> 01:51:49.294]  Okay.
[01:51:49.454 --> 01:51:52.215]  Every day is a new day and there's a new opportunity for you.
[01:51:52.255 --> 01:51:54.757]  Should you be concerned about these issues?
[01:51:55.357 --> 01:51:56.017]  Absolutely.
[01:51:56.238 --> 01:51:58.559]  But don't be afraid of them because again, fear
[01:51:59.742 --> 01:52:02.243]  Fear does not allow people to act.
[01:52:02.623 --> 01:52:04.924]  Or when they do act, they act from an irrational standpoint.
[01:52:04.944 --> 01:52:05.084]  I agree.
[01:52:05.104 --> 01:52:09.366]  I'm saying, how do we act to resist this, to try to stop it, and B, to protect ourselves?
[01:52:09.386 --> 01:52:10.106]  What's your view on that?
[01:52:10.867 --> 01:52:11.547]  Well, absolutely.
[01:52:12.067 --> 01:52:13.328]  Number one, raise your awareness.
[01:52:13.348 --> 01:52:14.628]  Look at what's going on around you.
[01:52:14.668 --> 01:52:16.249]  They are making their move right now.
[01:52:16.269 --> 01:52:18.790]  They're making their final move right now, in my view.
[01:52:18.850 --> 01:52:20.290]  I totally agree with you here.
[01:52:20.851 --> 01:52:21.671]  So what did they do?
[01:52:23.152 --> 01:52:27.116]  Obviously, disconnect yourself from the propaganda and the fake news.
[01:52:27.196 --> 01:52:29.819]  Look through it all and realize what's going on around you.
[01:52:29.879 --> 01:52:34.183]  How we protect ourselves, again, is number one, raising our awareness.
[01:52:34.223 --> 01:52:37.826]  Number two, being spiritually strong, physically strong.
[01:52:37.966 --> 01:52:39.368]  That would be number two, three.
[01:52:39.808 --> 01:52:45.594]  And then, you know, again, band together with like-minded people, because when this stuff really comes down,
[01:52:46.280 --> 01:52:47.821]  We're going to need each other, Alex.
[01:52:47.881 --> 01:52:48.522]  You know that.
[01:52:48.722 --> 01:52:49.263]  I know that.
[01:52:49.283 --> 01:52:55.508]  The people listening says we're all going to need each other regardless of what we look like, what we believe, our belief system.
[01:52:55.528 --> 01:52:56.749]  We're going to need each other.
[01:52:57.330 --> 01:52:57.750]  Period.
[01:52:57.770 --> 01:52:58.051]  The end.
[01:52:58.091 --> 01:53:04.476]  Because I think again, as we, you have been alluding to, and I have said here, we're going towards a worst case scenario here.
[01:53:04.536 --> 01:53:09.521]  They'll pull the plug when they're ready to pull the plug, but we got to be ready now.
[01:53:09.961 --> 01:53:11.543]  Always have the high ground.
[01:53:12.304 --> 01:53:18.912]  You know, like I said, spiritually, physically, emotionally, get together with those like-minded people.
[01:53:18.952 --> 01:53:20.794]  From a financial standpoint, this is simple.
[01:53:21.175 --> 01:53:23.198]  I mean, this could not be easier to me.
[01:53:23.218 --> 01:53:26.482]  I look at this and say, okay, what's the current environment?
[01:53:26.682 --> 01:53:28.685]  They're flooding the world with dollars here.
[01:53:30.405 --> 01:53:31.445]  Banks have gone crazy.
[01:53:31.505 --> 01:53:32.906]  They're printing like we've never seen.
[01:53:32.946 --> 01:53:34.546]  They're buying debt like we've never seen.
[01:53:34.566 --> 01:53:36.746]  They're issuing debt like we've never seen.
[01:53:37.026 --> 01:53:39.147]  So you want to take the opposite side of that trade.
[01:53:39.447 --> 01:53:40.147]  It's so simple.
[01:53:40.167 --> 01:53:46.348]  You want to be in physical assets, physical gold, physical silver, my all-time favorite undivided asset in the history of the world.
[01:53:46.648 --> 01:53:48.168]  I also believe in cryptocurrencies.
[01:53:48.208 --> 01:53:52.509]  If they do not regulate cryptos, and I don't believe they're going to, they're going to go much, much higher.
[01:53:52.529 --> 01:53:53.770]  I've been calling Bitcoin since like 3000.
[01:53:53.810 --> 01:53:54.230]  It's like 58,000 right now.
[01:53:57.250 --> 01:53:59.772]  So that's how we protect ourselves, at least from that standpoint.
[01:53:59.812 --> 01:54:04.215]  Me, I trade these markets, but I understand it's rigged, and it's not going to go on forever.
[01:54:04.275 --> 01:54:07.857]  I trade the market I have, I pull my profits out, and I allocate those profits.
[01:54:07.877 --> 01:54:11.880]  So you work on the system knowing the knowledge you have, but you're not... That's what I tell people.
[01:54:12.200 --> 01:54:17.604]  Knowing about the globalists and how things work, if you were just a cynical person that wanted to make money, you'd be more successful knowing this.
[01:54:18.064 --> 01:54:20.686]  But instead, like you said, some people get into the lie.
[01:54:20.706 --> 01:54:22.547]  They think they're powerful believing in it.
[01:54:23.905 --> 01:54:28.109]  Well, you know what, look, just realize it's an environment of lies.
[01:54:28.549 --> 01:54:33.373]  And understanding that we are in this environment of lies gives us enormous power.
[01:54:33.854 --> 01:54:35.135]  Enormous power!
[01:54:35.155 --> 01:54:36.256]  I want people to understand that.
[01:54:37.406 --> 01:54:47.072]  By understanding the current situation, by following you, Alex, your work, I would like to believe my work, we are empowering people on an unbelievable scale.
[01:54:47.773 --> 01:54:51.175]  Instead of being brainwashed, they're able to see what's actually going on.
[01:54:51.235 --> 01:54:56.618]  And that is a profound thing for people to be able to understand what the truth is.
[01:54:56.658 --> 01:54:58.519]  People know the truth when they hear it, Alex.
[01:54:59.140 --> 01:55:02.762]  We're not telling people bad stuff is happening because we want them to be scared.
[01:55:02.942 --> 01:55:05.724]  We want them to get up and get ready and do something about it so they're ready.
[01:55:06.806 --> 01:55:10.928]  That's exactly what we want them to do, and there's nothing... Look, I think people are starting to get it.
[01:55:11.148 --> 01:55:12.809]  I also believe something else is going on.
[01:55:13.069 --> 01:55:15.430]  There is a natural selection going on.
[01:55:15.490 --> 01:55:17.131]  There are some people that are going to get through this.
[01:55:17.671 --> 01:55:26.094]  And most people, they are blind sheep walking to the slaughter, willingly doing this because they believe the government wants to take care of them.
[01:55:26.435 --> 01:55:27.655]  They believe the lies.
[01:55:27.695 --> 01:55:29.076]  They believe the propaganda.
[01:55:30.862 --> 01:55:36.044]  It's mind-blowing to me, but there's a large amount of people out here that believe it.
[01:55:36.445 --> 01:55:43.608]  They want to believe it, because again, the truth plays with their stable datum, you understand?
[01:55:44.088 --> 01:55:47.830]  So it throws them off kilter, and they don't know what to do.
[01:55:49.056 --> 01:56:04.596]  Again, there's going to be that group of people, and then there are the group of people that you and I, Alex, are able to get through to, and I'm urging people to share this information, to get it out there, share Alex's work far and wide, my work, anyone who's trying to make a difference.
[01:56:04.616 --> 01:56:04.796]  I agree.
[01:56:04.816 --> 01:56:06.919]  Now is the time to raise the alarm, but let's talk about the third group.
[01:56:07.299 --> 01:56:13.464]  Is there any point in reaching the minions of the globalists that know it's evil but are going along because they're going to get screwed in the end?
[01:56:13.764 --> 01:56:17.547]  Or what about trying to actually talk to the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, the globalists?
[01:56:17.628 --> 01:56:20.750]  I mean, because I've talked to their representatives.
[01:56:21.050 --> 01:56:22.151]  They just say, you have no hope.
[01:56:22.171 --> 01:56:22.832]  Humanity's dead.
[01:56:22.872 --> 01:56:23.332]  Join us.
[01:56:23.753 --> 01:56:24.733]  It's like talking to a robot.
[01:56:24.793 --> 01:56:26.455]  But is there any point talking to them?
[01:56:28.268 --> 01:56:32.371]  Talking to them, Alex, I think that's something that's probably been going on for a very, very long time.
[01:56:32.391 --> 01:56:41.578]  I don't unfortunately believe there's a way to, other than being aware and trying to get more people to understand what's going on, to counter this.
[01:56:41.618 --> 01:56:44.680]  Look, for every action there should be an equal and opposite reaction.
[01:56:45.980 --> 01:56:48.202]  So, I mean, again, what are we doing, you and me?
[01:56:48.322 --> 01:56:49.702]  We're out here trying to raise awareness.
[01:56:49.722 --> 01:56:52.944]  I don't think... I think we let them know that they're going to be held accountable for this.
[01:56:53.044 --> 01:56:54.044]  They're not going to get away with this.
[01:56:54.345 --> 01:56:58.827]  I think exposing their behind to collapse might actually have them maybe back off, maybe not.
[01:56:59.047 --> 01:57:01.028]  They seem to be committed, though, like a gun to their head.
[01:57:01.348 --> 01:57:02.749]  Because what they're doing is extremely dangerous.
[01:57:03.427 --> 01:57:04.547]  They're going to kill people, Alex.
[01:57:04.788 --> 01:57:05.628]  They're going to kill people.
[01:57:05.648 --> 01:57:06.448]  They're going to kill millions.
[01:57:06.968 --> 01:57:07.729]  Millions of people.
[01:57:07.789 --> 01:57:09.089]  And I've been warning about this, too.
[01:57:09.109 --> 01:57:10.610]  There's an article I wrote a while back.
[01:57:10.650 --> 01:57:11.390]  People can look it up.
[01:57:11.430 --> 01:57:13.331]  It's called Global Debt in the Human Bubble.
[01:57:13.751 --> 01:57:15.212]  Global Debt in the Human Bubble.
[01:57:15.572 --> 01:57:16.432]  It's available anyway.
[01:57:16.452 --> 01:57:17.073]  Just Google it.
[01:57:18.033 --> 01:57:18.373]  Anyway.
[01:57:18.453 --> 01:57:20.194]  I mean, Global Debt in the Human Bubble.
[01:57:20.214 --> 01:57:20.494]  Look it up.
[01:57:21.286 --> 01:57:22.307]  Global debt and the human bubble.
[01:57:22.327 --> 01:57:24.928]  It explains the current situation, what they're going to try to do here.
[01:57:24.948 --> 01:57:29.050]  They're going to deliberately create a resource problem.
[01:57:29.531 --> 01:57:33.333]  In other words, the current financial system is going to collapse by design.
[01:57:33.793 --> 01:57:36.335]  When that happens here, resources are going to become scarce.
[01:57:36.815 --> 01:57:38.276]  People are not going to be able to transact.
[01:57:38.296 --> 01:57:39.396]  We're going to have a credit freeze.
[01:57:39.596 --> 01:57:41.217]  Cash is not going to be available.
[01:57:41.557 --> 01:57:42.958]  And that's when they're going to be done here.
[01:57:43.238 --> 01:57:45.780]  When people are in the streets running around, they don't know what to do.
[01:57:45.800 --> 01:57:46.820]  They're going to look to the government.
[01:57:46.840 --> 01:57:49.122]  And they're going to call that panic a race war when it's really a bubble.
[01:57:49.783 --> 01:57:50.585]  Save us all.
[01:57:50.825 --> 01:57:52.109]  Save us, Mr. Government.
[01:57:52.329 --> 01:57:54.034]  That's what they're going to do is just set up here.
[01:57:54.776 --> 01:57:57.082]  And there'll be the new global currency just for them.
[01:57:58.348 --> 01:57:59.929]  We're going to have a new global currency.
[01:58:00.189 --> 01:58:00.829]  Absolutely.
[01:58:01.049 --> 01:58:02.070]  It's already done.
[01:58:02.370 --> 01:58:05.491]  It's just a matter of them when they're going to roll it out.
[01:58:06.091 --> 01:58:08.032]  And they're going to roll it out soon, I think.
[01:58:08.172 --> 01:58:11.253]  Again, at a time of their choosing, Alex.
[01:58:11.293 --> 01:58:14.595]  I want you to hit other key points you want to cover with Gregory Manorino.
[01:58:14.615 --> 01:58:15.275]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:58:15.295 --> 01:58:20.017]  On the other side, I'm with Infowars.com, Newswars.com, and Band.Video.
[01:58:20.117 --> 01:58:23.418]  And of course, you can find TradersChoice.net and find our guests.
[01:58:23.438 --> 01:58:24.139]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:24.159 --> 01:58:27.000]  And then Paul Joseph Watson from Summit.News takes over.
[01:58:28.157 --> 01:58:29.397]  The mayor of D.C.
[01:58:29.477 --> 01:58:35.079]  came out and attacked the poor Asian man that was killed when two women, two young girls, 15 and 13, tasered him.
[01:58:36.439 --> 01:58:40.220]  Banning his money, he jammed on the accelerator, crashed the car, flipped out and died.
[01:58:40.240 --> 01:58:44.521]  They climbed out so they were victims to the National Guard that began pointing guns at his dead body.
[01:58:46.742 --> 01:58:47.522]  That's how this works.
[01:58:49.263 --> 01:58:51.483]  It's just total destruction of society.
[01:58:51.503 --> 01:58:54.124]  We've got some of that coming up next segment.
[01:58:54.364 --> 01:58:57.185]  And the left calling the mask a sacrament.
[01:58:58.192 --> 01:59:02.094]  Demanding it never come off, AP articles, Reuters articles, you name it.
[01:59:03.035 --> 01:59:08.778]  I've got a lady freaking out saying at a board meeting the CDC must extend the mask mandate forever.
[01:59:08.798 --> 01:59:11.399]  These are really sick people.
[01:59:11.719 --> 01:59:14.301]  What do you think, Gregory Manorino, has happened to them?
[01:59:14.921 --> 01:59:20.666]  That makes them have Stockholm Syndrome and just love this tyranny and just grovel to lies.
[01:59:21.066 --> 01:59:26.991]  And I'm not putting women down, but it's particularly women that are the vanguard of this and the Stockholm Syndrome.
[01:59:27.011 --> 01:59:32.815]  We know women are about 75% more susceptible to Stockholm Syndrome-like behavior.
[01:59:33.436 --> 01:59:36.578]  That's why, again, any conquering group leaves the women alive, kills the men.
[01:59:36.638 --> 01:59:39.501]  But is there a way to get through to these women or is there no way?
[01:59:41.348 --> 01:59:43.470]  Well, you know, look what they're doing here.
[01:59:43.530 --> 01:59:47.413]  They're trying to force people to wear this New World Order symbol across their face.
[01:59:47.874 --> 01:59:49.555]  They're keeping people in a state of fear.
[01:59:49.595 --> 01:59:56.181]  And those people on the other side of this, they've sold out already to the New World Order, body and soul.
[01:59:56.201 --> 01:59:59.284]  Okay, so there's no stopping that.
[01:59:59.584 --> 02:00:04.809]  We just got to, again, understand what we're looking at, raise awareness, and be ready
[02:00:05.583 --> 02:00:08.106]  Be ready, people, for anything.
[02:00:08.626 --> 02:00:09.687]  Be ready for anything.
[02:00:09.807 --> 02:00:13.911]  This is what my message has been over the past week on my own blog that I do twice a day.
[02:00:14.612 --> 02:00:25.483]  Be ready, people, because I can promise you we're about to see a few events occur relatively soon that are going to really make a difference here, a negative difference in the world.
[02:00:25.983 --> 02:00:29.367]  They have, again, as Alex and I have been talking about here, the
[02:00:34.372 --> 02:00:41.975]  For what's coming, because I can promise you it's going to get worse and you're going to get more people selling out to this new world order agenda, unfortunately.
[02:00:42.355 --> 02:00:47.537]  But again, we can counter that by raising our own awareness and getting more people.
[02:00:47.577 --> 02:00:49.557]  When they sell out, they don't even get anything.
[02:00:50.158 --> 02:00:51.658]  It's like there's always more, more, more.
[02:00:51.698 --> 02:00:53.359]  They don't even get anything we're selling out now.
[02:00:54.699 --> 02:00:56.840]  No, I don't know what, why they're doing it.
[02:00:56.920 --> 02:01:02.022]  I think it's, look, the agenda here is very, very dark.
[02:01:02.617 --> 02:01:05.498]  And obviously that's, it's kind of in our face here.
[02:01:05.618 --> 02:01:11.599]  I don't know how they go out and approach certain people or how they tell them how it actually works.
[02:01:12.399 --> 02:01:18.380]  Um, but I do believe that those people that are in positions of power, they're told we're depopulating the earth.
[02:01:18.420 --> 02:01:19.060]  We're saving it.
[02:01:19.160 --> 02:01:21.700]  I mean, they tell them let's come out.
[02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:23.461]  Exactly.
[02:01:23.541 --> 02:01:26.261]  They tell them how it's going to work and they, maybe they're threatened.
[02:01:26.361 --> 02:01:31.842]  I have no idea, but we do, but we do need to understand is there is a very dark shadow
[02:01:33.087 --> 02:01:34.408]  We are quickly degrading as a society.
[02:01:34.428 --> 02:01:35.229]  We're coming apart.
[02:01:35.249 --> 02:01:39.513]  People are not coming together and that's part of their agenda to keep people divided and they're relying on people to
[02:01:52.233 --> 02:01:53.334]  Propagate that agenda.
[02:01:53.695 --> 02:01:54.796]  We got to get away from that.
[02:01:55.076 --> 02:01:57.699]  We got to bring people together no matter what.
[02:01:58.499 --> 02:02:07.448]  Because again, I really do believe this and I know you do too, that we are headed for a worst case scenario here and things are going to get much, much worse.
[02:02:07.488 --> 02:02:15.016]  And I think rapidly, I think relatively soon, while they got the world on a stranglehold right now, not just the United States, they're going to squeeze harder.
[02:02:15.931 --> 02:02:16.011]  I'm
[02:02:34.343 --> 02:02:36.324]  That's exactly what they're going to do.
[02:02:36.624 --> 02:02:38.505]  They're going to break the current system.
[02:02:38.525 --> 02:02:39.365]  That's what they've done.
[02:02:39.385 --> 02:02:39.745]  Globally.
[02:02:39.785 --> 02:02:40.745]  They've shut the world down.
[02:03:03.410 --> 02:03:04.512]  Well, you know what?
[02:03:04.692 --> 02:03:06.356]  It's going to be quite an experience.
[02:03:07.638 --> 02:03:11.545]  And what's going to make me sick, Alex, is I think, and we've got to make a difference now.
[02:03:11.765 --> 02:03:14.491]  This is why I think your message is so important.
[02:03:14.571 --> 02:03:15.693]  My message is so important.
[02:03:16.858 --> 02:03:20.600]  We have got to raise awareness now.
[02:03:20.680 --> 02:03:23.702]  I've been warning you too for a very, very long time.
[02:03:24.242 --> 02:03:30.705]  And I think we have gotten through to a vast number of people, thankfully, but we need more.
[02:03:31.125 --> 02:03:34.627]  This is and this is why I always tell people, please get this stuff out there.
[02:03:34.667 --> 02:03:35.568]  Start talking about it.
[02:03:36.028 --> 02:03:38.709]  You know, let people understand what's the situation we're in.
[02:03:38.729 --> 02:03:42.451]  Now, there is some Alex that we're not going to be able to get through to no matter what we do.
[02:03:43.031 --> 02:03:44.012]  They just won't hear it.
[02:03:44.898 --> 02:03:45.878]  But there are some that will.
[02:03:46.138 --> 02:03:51.660]  And I urge people, don't waste your time on those you can't get through to because they're not going to change their mind.
[02:03:52.821 --> 02:03:53.261]  Move on.
[02:03:53.661 --> 02:03:55.482]  Find someone else, even if it's a family member.
[02:03:56.142 --> 02:03:57.482]  Move on to another person.
[02:03:57.522 --> 02:03:59.003]  Let them understand what's going on.
[02:03:59.503 --> 02:04:00.543]  Get them on our team.
[02:04:00.583 --> 02:04:06.625]  We need to form an army in many, many ways, a global army of people that understand what's going on.
[02:04:06.665 --> 02:04:10.527]  Because when this really rears its ugly head,
[02:04:12.099 --> 02:04:14.361]  I'm going to fall back on what I've been saying through this whole show.
[02:04:14.541 --> 02:04:17.384]  We're going to need each other.
[02:04:17.444 --> 02:04:18.605]  It's that, it's that simple.
[02:04:19.205 --> 02:04:19.726]  I agree with you.
[02:04:19.786 --> 02:04:24.530]  And something I've found, I have a lot of great family, but some family thinks you're showing off to them.
[02:04:24.550 --> 02:04:25.831]  They think you're trying to dominate them.
[02:04:26.431 --> 02:04:30.395]  And I'll just go, you know, I'm really glad that the UN and Klaus Schwab said that they're going to bankrupt everybody.
[02:04:30.415 --> 02:04:31.536]  We're all going to be poor.
[02:04:31.556 --> 02:04:32.397]  That's going to be good for the earth.
[02:04:32.417 --> 02:04:33.618]  People go, well, what do you mean?
[02:04:34.218 --> 02:04:36.921]  So if you like, like, I agree what we should depopulate, don't you?
[02:04:38.237 --> 02:04:38.998]  Are you looking for it?
[02:04:39.518 --> 02:04:41.940]  That's the way to get kind of the smart asses to wake up.
[02:04:42.261 --> 02:04:43.942]  The frontal assault doesn't work, but I agree.
[02:04:44.202 --> 02:04:47.885]  Just move on from them and just be like, hey folks, we told you the lockdown would never end.
[02:04:49.327 --> 02:04:50.348]  Now they're saying it isn't.
[02:04:51.569 --> 02:04:52.629]  How much will you put up with?
[02:04:52.970 --> 02:04:54.151]  I would just ask people that question.
[02:04:55.652 --> 02:04:58.335]  I wish I knew the answer to that, because they're going to keep throwing stuff at us.
[02:04:58.355 --> 02:05:00.036]  They're going to tell us about new variants.
[02:05:00.336 --> 02:05:01.838]  Oh, this is a really bad one this time.
[02:05:01.858 --> 02:05:03.439]  Oh, we're going to shut down this economy again.
[02:05:03.459 --> 02:05:04.661]  Oh, we're going to shut down that one too.
[02:05:04.681 --> 02:05:08.704]  They're not going to allow the economy to open until they're done.
[02:05:08.724 --> 02:05:13.389]  And when they say Trust Science, that means the UN and Select Big Pharma, which is owned by the big banks.
[02:05:15.377 --> 02:05:16.758]  Absolutely, that's what they're going to do.
[02:05:17.078 --> 02:05:18.339]  I mean, it's incredible what they're doing.
[02:05:18.620 --> 02:05:24.904]  They are just so desperate to get whatever's in that freaking syringe into every person's body.
[02:05:24.924 --> 02:05:27.406]  That should tell us all something here.
[02:05:27.426 --> 02:05:31.068]  And there's going to be new variants, new boosters, new this, new that.
[02:05:31.088 --> 02:05:34.791]  And if this doesn't work, they're going to spring something else on us, some of the worst thing.
[02:05:36.111 --> 02:05:44.414]  True or not, to make people afraid, because if you can make them afraid of one thing, just one, you can control their minds.
[02:05:44.754 --> 02:05:45.494]  And that's what they're doing.
[02:05:45.514 --> 02:05:47.695]  This is a PSYOP on a massive scale.
[02:05:47.735 --> 02:05:49.995]  Most people, Alex, they have no idea what's going on.
[02:05:50.316 --> 02:05:51.576]  You know just as well as I do.
[02:05:51.896 --> 02:05:54.677]  You walk around, you talk to people, they think that you are like...
[02:05:56.558 --> 02:06:10.783]  I mean, I've talked to senators, I've talked to presidents, I've talked to top scientists, and I'll start sitting there having a discussion with them, like with the top AI scientists, and they can't believe I actually know about AI and high-level AI discussions.
[02:06:10.803 --> 02:06:12.164]  They go, well, who are you?
[02:06:12.204 --> 02:06:13.204]  What agency are you with?
[02:06:13.505 --> 02:06:14.345]  How do you even know all this?
[02:06:14.405 --> 02:06:19.287]  And I'm like, well, I actually studied the open white papers, and most of the top people really just are big mouths.
[02:06:19.607 --> 02:06:21.608]  They're not actually even applying themselves to the research.
[02:06:23.323 --> 02:06:24.204]  Oh, of course not.
[02:06:24.264 --> 02:06:25.965]  Look, they don't even care.
[02:06:26.025 --> 02:06:27.226]  All they care about is themselves.
[02:06:27.987 --> 02:06:28.447]  Exactly.
[02:06:28.487 --> 02:06:30.408]  They're always looking for whatever makes the most money.
[02:06:30.689 --> 02:06:32.050]  They're not in love with the knowledge.
[02:06:32.250 --> 02:06:32.830]  It's crazy.
[02:06:33.851 --> 02:06:35.432]  No, it's all about greed.
[02:06:35.552 --> 02:06:36.273]  It's about greed.
[02:06:36.393 --> 02:06:43.198]  What has led most major civilizations to collapse historically is a total
[02:06:44.463 --> 02:06:49.786]  An environment of corruption, okay, which a lot of it is greed driven.
[02:06:50.046 --> 02:06:51.047]  And that's what we're seeing here.
[02:06:51.387 --> 02:06:56.550]  We're seeing a collapse of our nation, of the world here.
[02:06:56.570 --> 02:06:59.452]  The New World Order agenda is all about greed.
[02:06:59.492 --> 02:07:00.772]  It's about control.
[02:07:01.153 --> 02:07:03.814]  It's about the few controlling the many.
[02:07:04.094 --> 02:07:08.377]  This is a mechanism that we have all seen since time immemorial.
[02:07:08.677 --> 02:07:11.299]  We'll never stop, but we've never seen anything like this.
[02:07:11.319 --> 02:07:13.321]  And then when they say, sorry, your vaccine doesn't protect you.
[02:07:13.361 --> 02:07:14.362]  Oh, there's a new variant?
[02:07:14.702 --> 02:07:15.683]  We saw that a year ago.
[02:07:15.763 --> 02:07:18.365]  All right, Gregory Manorino, TradersChoice.net.
[02:07:18.405 --> 02:07:21.448]  Thank you so much for your time on this Tuesday edition.
[02:07:22.309 --> 02:07:23.009]  Thanks for having me, Alex.
[02:07:23.030 --> 02:07:23.810]  I really enjoyed being on the show.
[02:07:23.830 --> 02:07:24.050]  Thank you.
[02:07:24.090 --> 02:07:24.531]  Great hour.
[02:07:24.911 --> 02:07:29.215]  All right, we got Paul Joseph Watson set to take over.
[02:07:29.835 --> 02:07:32.738]  But there's a big article I didn't hit the last two days that I want to hit.
[02:07:32.778 --> 02:07:33.419]  It's out of Reuters.
[02:07:33.439 --> 02:07:34.239]  There's actually a bunch of these.
[02:07:35.484 --> 02:07:40.186]  China's coal consumption seen rising in 2021, imports steady.
[02:07:41.986 --> 02:07:49.348]  And it goes on to admit they went from 42% of world coal use just a few years ago to 50 plus percent today.
[02:07:49.368 --> 02:07:55.450]  So everybody else is having their coal cut off, which is the best source of power, totally clean, if you run the scrubbers right.
[02:07:56.231 --> 02:07:58.991]  And then they get to run everything because their energy is super cheap.
[02:07:59.312 --> 02:08:01.132]  The only place you can do business is China.
[02:08:01.712 --> 02:08:02.653]  And so it's game over.
[02:08:03.013 --> 02:08:03.493]  We lose.
[02:08:05.239 --> 02:08:14.463]  Meanwhile, Pete Buttigieg has an update about his mileage tax, which tracks you and controls you with a computer chip magically already in your car.
[02:08:26.903 --> 02:08:37.751]  On top of the gas tax to make sure you don't use more fuel and of course China will not have that against cementing our economic collapse and total continued decline into oblivion.
[02:08:38.632 --> 02:08:42.456]  And the average leftist just like has been trained to hate America and hate themselves.
[02:08:42.916 --> 02:08:44.718]  So they just go, shut up, you don't know anything.
[02:08:45.058 --> 02:08:46.499]  We're about to have a beautiful future.
[02:08:46.539 --> 02:08:52.104]  And like, yeah, you're about to have a beautiful future of feces and needles everywhere and total collapse and burning cities.
[02:08:52.144 --> 02:08:54.867]  But they don't care because they're of their father, the devil.
[02:08:55.227 --> 02:08:57.349]  Paul Joseph Watson set to take over.
[02:09:18.576 --> 02:09:20.758]  Welcome everybody and we are back live.
[02:09:20.818 --> 02:09:22.199]  It is the Summit News Hour.
[02:09:22.319 --> 02:09:31.165]  We're going to be going through a whole host of lockdown slash masking slash coronavirus slash Wuhan Institute of Virology news.
[02:09:32.266 --> 02:09:42.414]  The head of the WHO has basically just come out and said that the WHO's own report into the Wuhan Institute of Virology was basically a whitewash.
[02:09:43.109 --> 02:09:46.810]  Pretty big news coming from the head of the World Health Organization.
[02:09:47.450 --> 02:09:56.392]  Of course they had such an in-depth investigation of that lab back a few months ago that they were literally there for three hours.
[02:09:57.293 --> 02:10:02.214]  The summary of their investigation, the intensity of their investigation,
[02:10:03.231 --> 02:10:25.420]  was basically founded on them visiting the lab for three hours, having already visited these wet markets where these animals are sold, and basically asking the Chinese scientists inside the Wuhan lab, this virus we've been looking at, we've been to all these wet markets in the immediate area, we haven't found it there.
[02:10:25.480 --> 02:10:29.342]  In fact, in the WHO's own report, which just got released today,
[02:10:30.208 --> 02:10:38.173]  They tested 45,000 animals in the area and couldn't find COVID in any of them.
[02:10:38.213 --> 02:10:39.934]  They all tested negative for COVID.
[02:10:41.175 --> 02:10:47.319]  So they've looked at the meat markets, they've tested 45,000 animals, haven't found any trace of COVID.
[02:10:47.779 --> 02:10:54.103]  They've gone to the lab and they've said, you know this virus we've been looking into, did you leak it from this lab?
[02:10:54.699 --> 02:10:57.181]  And their response was, no, we had nothing to do with it.
[02:10:57.741 --> 02:10:58.682]  Case closed.
[02:10:59.523 --> 02:11:01.104]  That's literally what they said.
[02:11:01.864 --> 02:11:13.333]  And now the head of the WHO has come out and said that the explanation that it leaked from the lab is still on the table, despite his own organization's report saying it's not even on the table.
[02:11:14.614 --> 02:11:15.775]  So we're going to get into that.
[02:11:15.815 --> 02:11:19.478]  We're going to also get into YouTube, just came out in the past hour.
[02:11:20.638 --> 02:11:35.833]  And said, now get this, they're going to hide the dislikes, or at least they're doing experiments with some users, obviously we know this has rolled out after having beta tested it, they're going to hide the dislike count on videos!
[02:11:36.493 --> 02:11:41.939]  Now I wonder, do you reckon that this has got anything whatsoever to do with the fact that
[02:11:42.837 --> 02:11:51.783]  Every single official White House YouTube Biden administration video has gargantuan downlikes compared to thumbs up.
[02:11:52.324 --> 02:11:57.588]  In fact, I looked at Biden's press conference, which he did, what was it, last week?
[02:11:58.568 --> 02:12:03.572]  About 600 odd thumbs up on the video, 12,000 thumbs down.
[02:12:04.052 --> 02:12:06.954]  And that's a light touch, that's a minor one.
[02:12:06.994 --> 02:12:12.238]  There are other examples, especially if you look at the videos after his inauguration, unless they've just
[02:12:13.064 --> 02:12:18.948]  Wiped the dislikes off, of course there is an option to do that on YouTube, but then you have to also wipe off the thumbs up.
[02:12:19.348 --> 02:12:20.669]  That one had even more!
[02:12:21.330 --> 02:12:24.332]  Probably 50,000 downvotes last time I saw it.
[02:12:25.252 --> 02:12:34.458]  So now YouTube has come out and they've said to stop hate and harassment, to stop people being mean by clicking a button on YouTube.
[02:12:35.919 --> 02:12:39.962]  Over the next few weeks they're going to test several new interface designs.
[02:12:41.195 --> 02:12:44.658]  That won't publicly display how many dislikes a video has earned.
[02:12:44.758 --> 02:12:53.205]  In the design the company showed off, the dislike button is still there for people to tap, but it doesn't have a count that's updated in real time.
[02:12:53.926 --> 02:12:55.687]  So they're basically going to get rid of that.
[02:12:55.967 --> 02:12:58.890]  My screen is frozen if you just want to restart that, by the way.
[02:13:00.592 --> 02:13:14.957]  So they're going to get rid of it because the Biden White House Administration channel routinely on every single video has at least 10 times, if not 20, 30 times thumbs down compared to thumbs up.
[02:13:17.078 --> 02:13:20.339]  We're going to get into that on the other side of the break.
[02:13:20.359 --> 02:13:28.042]  We're also going to get into Marjorie Taylor Greene being lambasted, ridiculed, actually trending on Twitter right now.
[02:13:29.379 --> 02:13:46.793]  Because she said that the vaccine passport, which CNN reported the Biden administration was planning to roll out within a matter of weeks as of yesterday, is the mark of the beast because it will be used to determine who is allowed to buy or sell.
[02:13:47.794 --> 02:13:57.042]  Basically, they're admitting concurrently that that is the case, but also that she's a horrible conspiracy theorist talking about biblical prophecy and that she's insane.
[02:13:57.062 --> 02:13:58.563]  We'll get into that and more on the other side
[02:13:59.384 --> 02:14:26.676]  So the WHO has come out and basically said there's no evidence that the coronavirus leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, having performed a really in-depth thorough investigation of that premise by literally going to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, walking around the building for about three hours, and asking the scientists within that building if they accidentally leaked the virus from the lab.
[02:14:27.376 --> 02:14:28.597]  And those scientists said
[02:14:29.392 --> 02:14:30.493]  No, we had nothing to do with it.
[02:14:31.293 --> 02:14:32.915]  And that was the investigation closed.
[02:14:33.035 --> 02:14:33.935]  Basically, that's it.
[02:14:33.955 --> 02:14:36.838]  We're going to have more on that later on in the show.
[02:14:38.018 --> 02:14:50.828]  Also, we're going to have more on the lockdown in the UK, which isn't going to officially end, even if they still stick to their own timetable, their own timeline, for about three months time towards the end of June.
[02:14:50.888 --> 02:14:57.413]  But the government, having already given us permission last month or earlier this month to sit on a bench
[02:14:58.331 --> 02:15:00.552]  You know, two meters apart from another person.
[02:15:01.032 --> 02:15:05.333]  In all their gracious beneficence, they gave us that privilege.
[02:15:06.173 --> 02:15:12.895]  As of yesterday, they've said you can visit somebody and sit in their garden.
[02:15:13.655 --> 02:15:16.636]  You can actually go and see someone in the back garden.
[02:15:16.936 --> 02:15:22.418]  You can go into the park and sit with up to six people, I think it is.
[02:15:23.078 --> 02:15:24.878]  You can't go inside with them, of course.
[02:15:24.938 --> 02:15:27.419]  They'll knock on your door if they see you doing that.
[02:15:28.590 --> 02:15:30.232]  And now I go out in the park today.
[02:15:30.292 --> 02:15:31.153]  It's a nice day.
[02:15:31.233 --> 02:15:31.813]  Hot weather.
[02:15:32.994 --> 02:15:37.018]  Very good temperature for March, which they're using to fearmonger about climate change.
[02:15:37.339 --> 02:15:39.761]  Hottest March since 1963, which means it was hotter in 1963.
[02:15:39.821 --> 02:15:40.722]  But everyone's out in the park.
[02:15:44.787 --> 02:15:51.652]  In groups of six, because it's the first day or at least the second day that the government gave them permission.
[02:15:52.072 --> 02:15:55.574]  It's just incredible how these people actually follow these guidelines.
[02:15:55.894 --> 02:15:59.917]  They're not even enforceable and yet they still follow them.
[02:16:00.477 --> 02:16:01.638]  And then you look at the polls.
[02:16:01.658 --> 02:16:05.881]  90% support for lockdown in some of these polls.
[02:16:06.721 --> 02:16:11.925]  Then you go out on a Tuesday afternoon and see all these people sat on their arses doing nothing, sunbathing.
[02:16:12.600 --> 02:16:25.509]  Thinking, hmm, I wonder why they support lockdown in such high numbers, given that their wages are literally being paid by the government for them to sit on their arses on a Tuesday afternoon and sunbathe.
[02:16:25.569 --> 02:16:27.491]  Gee, I wonder why that support is so high.
[02:16:28.371 --> 02:16:32.414]  We have a video here though, out of Idaho, which we're going to roll.
[02:16:33.175 --> 02:16:34.576]  I saw this a couple of hours ago.
[02:16:34.596 --> 02:16:37.658]  A lot of speculation as to what's going on here.
[02:16:38.536 --> 02:16:46.879]  Headline is, Video Board of Trustees Member Has Bizarre Anger Episode While Demanding CDC Mask Mandate Be Maintained.
[02:16:48.059 --> 02:16:49.320]  And there's speculation.
[02:16:49.340 --> 02:17:02.504]  Because when I initially saw this video, other people on other websites were claiming that she was having breathing difficulties while saying that we need to keep the mask mandate, which is obviously very ironic.
[02:17:03.004 --> 02:17:05.205]  I'm not sure if she's having breathing difficulties.
[02:17:05.225 --> 02:17:07.986]  She's obviously having some kind of breathing episode.
[02:17:08.939 --> 02:17:24.227]  But whether it's also or it could be an anxiety attack or a panic attack, based on her sheer irate fury at the fact that she's been challenged on these mask mandates, let's go to the clip, see what you think for yourself.
[02:17:24.487 --> 02:17:25.047]  Here it is.
[02:17:25.087 --> 02:17:28.589]  This is a board of trustees member in Idaho.
[02:17:28.749 --> 02:17:29.609]  Let's roll the clip.
[02:17:30.189 --> 02:17:35.052]  They make recommendations for the entire country based on their
[02:17:36.900 --> 02:17:41.184]  Knowledge and their understanding of what is best for everyone.
[02:17:42.305 --> 02:17:47.088]  And they don't need to visit our school district to make recommendations for everyone.
[02:17:48.550 --> 02:18:05.684]  And they currently have recommendations out that with the current level of transmission in Bonneville County, that we should be in hybrid for the elementary schools and virtual for
[02:18:08.493 --> 02:18:11.495]  Middle schools and high schools.
[02:18:12.256 --> 02:18:13.457]  And we're not following that.
[02:18:14.658 --> 02:18:30.170]  But I do think that we should follow their request and their recommendation for masking.
[02:18:35.595 --> 02:18:35.875]  I'm done.
[02:18:37.282 --> 02:18:39.223]  So you want to pick and choose?
[02:18:39.263 --> 02:18:39.943]  Yes, I do!
[02:18:40.543 --> 02:18:42.144]  Yes, I do want to pick and choose.
[02:18:42.964 --> 02:18:53.108]  Because I think you might have a point, Paul, that we want to pick some things that are best for our local area.
[02:18:54.088 --> 02:19:01.091]  But some things might be best to follow the recommendations of the doctors.
[02:19:01.251 --> 02:19:06.353]  And I don't think that picking and choosing is a bad thing to try and make the best decision.
[02:19:08.030 --> 02:19:15.518]  So even before that clip, and there's a full clip on YouTube, but it's like two hours long, so that's why I embedded the tweet in the article.
[02:19:16.659 --> 02:19:21.925]  Even before that, she's snapping at people and telling them to shut up, telling them to stop interrupting her.
[02:19:22.505 --> 02:19:29.433]  This has been reported as her, quote, having trouble breathing, or having some kind of breathing attack, breathing episode.
[02:19:30.470 --> 02:19:53.164]  While she's trying to make these statements, while she's trying to force out these words and having a lot of difficulty in doing so, sounds to me more like some kind of anxiety attack, some kind of neurological effect, based on the fact that she's basically just exploding with anger about the fact that these people are one trustee member, the male voice that you heard,
[02:19:54.068 --> 02:19:57.831]  Challenged her on these mask mandates in terms of schools.
[02:19:57.911 --> 02:20:04.096]  They're talking about whether to maintain the mask mandate, forcing people to wear masks inside schools.
[02:20:04.896 --> 02:20:09.240]  So it's being reported, ironically, as, you know, trustee member
[02:20:09.955 --> 02:20:15.337]  Has breathing attack while promoting mask wearing, while she's wearing a mask.
[02:20:15.577 --> 02:20:22.480]  Sounds more like a panic attack to me, based on her anger, based on her exploding at the fact that she's challenged.
[02:20:22.780 --> 02:20:37.926]  As I write in the article, this woman who's called Elizabeth Cogliatti, her obnoxious, irate, power trip behavior is typical of those who desperately want to keep mask mandates in place, so they can silence and intimidate others into compliance.
[02:20:38.737 --> 02:20:40.338]  And you've seen these people on the streets.
[02:20:40.638 --> 02:20:44.481]  They will literally leap out of the way if you start walking towards them without a mask.
[02:20:45.241 --> 02:20:53.026]  We're talking about the same kind of people who have an absolute look of sheer terror in their face whenever they get within six feet of another person.
[02:20:53.326 --> 02:21:07.155]  Meanwhile, they'll literally cross the road staring at their phone, risking life and limb in a very real sense, not in a sense of a virus, which they have a 99.8% chance of surviving, according to CDC numbers.
[02:21:08.942 --> 02:21:12.807]  So it's another one of those power trip obnoxious episodes from what I can tell.
[02:21:13.748 --> 02:21:20.377]  Meanwhile, two weeks after media predicted catastrophe, Texas sees COVID cases drop to record low.
[02:21:22.208 --> 02:21:36.676]  More than two weeks after the media predicted catastrophe due to Texas lifting its mask mandate and Joe Biden labelling the move Neanderthal thinking, Covid cases in Texas have dropped to a record low, while hospitalisations are at their lowest since October.
[02:21:36.976 --> 02:21:49.883]  And this is the same thing we saw in France, in Germany, in Spain, where as soon as they introduced the mask mandate, and in the UK as well, by the way, the coronavirus cases shot way up.
[02:21:50.712 --> 02:21:52.854]  In Texas, they announced the end to it.
[02:21:52.894 --> 02:21:56.376]  They announced a 100% reopening of the state by March 10th.
[02:21:56.896 --> 02:21:57.697]  And what happened?
[02:21:58.217 --> 02:22:00.919]  Lowest cases ever recorded.
[02:22:01.219 --> 02:22:03.841]  Hospitalizations at their lowest since October.
[02:22:04.402 --> 02:22:12.567]  Now remember what the media said about this when it was announced by Texas Governor Greg Abbott at the start of the month.
[02:22:12.647 --> 02:22:14.509]  They went ballistic.
[02:22:14.589 --> 02:22:17.371]  They acted as if this would be the end of the world.
[02:22:17.971 --> 02:22:18.932]  Vanity fair.
[02:22:19.918 --> 02:22:28.522]  put out a headline which said Republican governors celebrate COVID anniversary with bold plan to kill another half a million Americans.
[02:22:28.562 --> 02:22:30.362]  They actually published that headline.
[02:22:31.163 --> 02:22:35.284]  California Governor Gavin Newsom said the decision was absolutely reckless.
[02:22:36.865 --> 02:22:40.267]  Fauci said it was inexplicable why you would want to pull back now.
[02:22:41.207 --> 02:22:45.929]  Virus expert Michael Osterholm told CNN, quote, we're walking into the mouth of a monster.
[02:22:47.068 --> 02:22:52.013]  Beto O'Rourke hyperventilated over the move being a big mistake and a cult of death.
[02:22:52.974 --> 02:22:57.058]  Author Kurt Eichenwald accused Abbott of making a murderous decision.
[02:22:57.858 --> 02:23:00.581]  And Joe Biden, of course, said it was Neanderthal thinking.
[02:23:01.642 --> 02:23:02.303]  What happened?
[02:23:02.703 --> 02:23:11.111]  Record low cases two weeks after they removed the mask mandate, two weeks after they opened up Texas.
[02:23:13.044 --> 02:23:20.730]  State recorded 2,292 coronavirus cases, about 500 fewer on average from last week and 107 new deaths.
[02:23:21.871 --> 02:23:28.736]  In other words, lifting the mask mandate and reopening the state did not lead to the health catastrophe predicted by all the experts.
[02:23:29.256 --> 02:23:31.318]  In fact, the opposite happened.
[02:23:31.438 --> 02:23:34.781]  Same thing has happened in the UK where they said don't open the schools.
[02:23:35.381 --> 02:23:36.802]  This is going to bring back the pandemic.
[02:23:37.182 --> 02:23:38.643]  Did not happen.
[02:23:38.844 --> 02:23:39.364]  Don't go away.
[02:23:39.404 --> 02:23:40.585]  Summit.News will be right back.
[02:23:41.989 --> 02:23:49.514]  So the Biden administration, it came out in the media yesterday, is working on vaccine passports.
[02:23:49.594 --> 02:23:51.315]  What are vaccine passports?
[02:23:51.395 --> 02:23:57.619]  Well, they're basically, in one sense, government permission slips to basically go about normal life.
[02:23:58.120 --> 02:24:07.846]  Those who don't get those vaccine passports, because they don't want to take the vaccine, will be under a de facto state of permanent lockdown forever.
[02:24:09.449 --> 02:24:14.833]  It's going to take more ID to go and see a baseball game in America than it is to vote.
[02:24:14.973 --> 02:24:17.074]  Oh, we can't have an ID for voting.
[02:24:17.134 --> 02:24:18.115]  No, no, no, no, no.
[02:24:18.615 --> 02:24:20.416]  How are we going to allow all the illegals to vote?
[02:24:20.477 --> 02:24:20.657]  No.
[02:24:21.477 --> 02:24:25.220]  Well, you have to have one to go into a grocery store, or at least that's the plan.
[02:24:26.120 --> 02:24:29.943]  And again, the point is, this is not just a vaccine passport.
[02:24:29.963 --> 02:24:32.525]  This is a digital ID card.
[02:24:32.985 --> 02:24:35.987]  It's going to be linked up to the facial recognition software.
[02:24:36.027 --> 02:24:37.328]  I'm going to get into that in a moment.
[02:24:38.573 --> 02:24:53.385]  Now we have Marjorie Taylor Greene trending on Twitter and all these leftists saying that she's completely insane for saying that Biden's planned vaccine passport is the mark of the beast.
[02:24:53.425 --> 02:24:58.709]  Headline Marjorie Taylor Greene says Biden's vaccine passport plan should be called the mark of the beast.
[02:25:00.170 --> 02:25:01.031]  Far right!
[02:25:01.592 --> 02:25:04.013]  That's anyone who's not far left at this point.
[02:25:04.294 --> 02:25:07.036]  Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene hits out at President Biden
[02:25:08.027 --> 02:25:15.335]  ...and his administration over reports of the potential launch of digital vaccine passports, saying they should be called Biden's Mark of the Beast.
[02:25:15.816 --> 02:25:16.617]  We have the clip.
[02:25:17.197 --> 02:25:17.858]  Gonna roll it.
[02:25:17.898 --> 02:25:19.120]  I'll come back and talk about it.
[02:25:19.200 --> 02:25:20.021]  Here's the clip.
[02:25:20.865 --> 02:25:25.546]  They want you to be required to have something called a COVID passport.
[02:25:25.646 --> 02:25:34.649]  And this would mandate your ability to be able to travel, your ability to be able to go to events, your ability to be able to buy and sell.
[02:25:35.469 --> 02:25:40.330]  And I asked the question earlier today, is this something like Biden's Mark of the Beast?
[02:25:40.450 --> 02:25:44.151]  Because that is really disturbing and not good.
[02:25:44.691 --> 02:25:54.059]  Oh, if you're going to come into the football game or the baseball game or the concert, you need your vaccine passport because we're trying to do a good job to keep everyone safe.
[02:25:54.499 --> 02:25:59.083]  This is what the Biden administration is trying to talk to these private companies into doing.
[02:25:59.563 --> 02:26:00.704]  Well, let's analyze that.
[02:26:01.205 --> 02:26:03.927]  You see, it's still the same thing.
[02:26:04.187 --> 02:26:10.332]  It's still fascism or communism, whatever you want to call it, but it's in, it's coming from private companies.
[02:26:10.572 --> 02:26:11.613]  So I have a term for that.
[02:26:11.693 --> 02:26:13.235]  I call it corporate communism.
[02:26:16.559 --> 02:26:18.763]  So now she's being pilloried on Twitter.
[02:26:18.803 --> 02:26:23.713]  She's being called an insane, crazy conspiracy theorist for saying that it is basically the Mark of the Beast.
[02:26:24.354 --> 02:26:26.358]  And in fact in this independent article...
[02:26:27.358 --> 02:26:32.200]  They say, the new move towards vaccine passports isn't a government policy.
[02:26:32.560 --> 02:26:35.121]  It's being developed with 17 private companies.
[02:26:35.741 --> 02:26:37.561]  Oh, it's not a government policy.
[02:26:37.601 --> 02:26:46.664]  You're just not going to be able to go into Walmart or CVS or wherever without showing your vaccine passport, which is your digital ID.
[02:26:47.004 --> 02:26:48.405]  Oh, it's not mandatory.
[02:26:48.725 --> 02:26:50.025]  It's not a government policy.
[02:26:50.045 --> 02:26:52.546]  You're just not going to be able to buy groceries without it.
[02:26:53.347 --> 02:26:54.427]  But it's not mandatory.
[02:26:55.137 --> 02:26:57.799]  They play the same trick here in the UK.
[02:26:58.800 --> 02:27:06.585]  The past six months they said, no, we've got no plans to introduce a domestic vaccine passport, that would be horrible, that would be discriminatory.
[02:27:07.426 --> 02:27:20.475]  Lo and behold, they've literally been funding big corporations working on it for the past three, four months with government grants, while telling the public they had no plans to introduce it.
[02:27:21.736 --> 02:27:23.998]  An example of the reaction to this on Twitter,
[02:27:25.185 --> 02:27:28.686]  Because she is trending right now, along with corporate communism.
[02:27:30.267 --> 02:27:34.028]  Somebody said, the idiocy on the right has hit a new level.
[02:27:34.628 --> 02:27:38.630]  Now they claim a vaccine passport is coming, much like the Mark of the Beast.
[02:27:39.270 --> 02:27:40.931]  No vaccine, no purchase power.
[02:27:41.791 --> 02:27:44.732]  And then they say, hell, that should be the law anyway.
[02:27:45.412 --> 02:27:52.095]  So they're saying, oh my God, how dare these crazy conspiracy theorists like Marjorie Greene-Taylor even suggest
[02:27:53.354 --> 02:28:00.458]  That the vaccine passport is similar to the Mark of the Beast described in the Book of Revelations in the Bible?
[02:28:01.178 --> 02:28:03.899]  You know, no man will be allowed to buy or sell without the mark.
[02:28:04.420 --> 02:28:06.421]  How dare they even make that suggestion?
[02:28:06.461 --> 02:28:07.361]  That's insane.
[02:28:08.262 --> 02:28:10.543]  That's completely doolally.
[02:28:11.003 --> 02:28:17.066]  Oh, by the way, the government should totally make it the law to make people take the mark to buy and sell.
[02:28:17.567 --> 02:28:22.129]  So on one hand they're saying it's insane if you even suggest it's like the Mark of the Beast in the Bible.
[02:28:23.044 --> 02:28:27.867]  Then on the other hand they're saying, oh but the government should legislate and make that the law!
[02:28:29.368 --> 02:28:36.573]  That they should force people to undergo a government medical procedure, by law, in order to be able to buy and sell.
[02:28:36.953 --> 02:28:45.979]  Oh but if you say that that's like the mark of the beast, every man should take the mark to be able to buy and sell, then you're an insane, crazy conspiracy theorist.
[02:28:46.659 --> 02:28:48.741]  See how they play that trick.
[02:28:49.941 --> 02:28:50.462]  Meanwhile,
[02:28:52.003 --> 02:28:52.363]  L.A.
[02:28:52.763 --> 02:28:58.305]  Times journalist says vaccine passports are good to, quote, break the resistance down.
[02:28:59.706 --> 02:29:11.330]  So this guy sounds like he's some arch villain out of a dystopian sci-fi thriller with an authoritarian dictatorship that puts people in medical concentration camps.
[02:29:11.891 --> 02:29:15.852]  No, he's a writer and a legal affairs consultant for the L.A.
[02:29:15.912 --> 02:29:16.352]  Times.
[02:29:17.813 --> 02:29:19.573]  Same thing, basically, at this point.
[02:29:19.954 --> 02:29:21.054]  This is Harry Litman.
[02:29:22.580 --> 02:29:23.841]  Who is the former U.S.
[02:29:23.901 --> 02:29:25.182]  Attorney, a former U.S.
[02:29:25.202 --> 02:29:27.363]  Attorney and Deputy Assistant Attorney General.
[02:29:27.403 --> 02:29:28.864]  He's a Clinton appointee.
[02:29:29.564 --> 02:29:32.406]  He said, quote, vaccine passports are a good idea.
[02:29:33.206 --> 02:29:41.812]  Among other things, it will single out the still large contingent of people who refuse vaccines, who will be foreclosed from doing a lot of things their peers can do.
[02:29:42.252 --> 02:29:44.833]  That should help break the resistance down.
[02:29:44.853 --> 02:29:50.477]  See, the problem with this that they're going to run into in a few months time,
[02:29:51.701 --> 02:30:17.983]  Three to six months time when they actually try to put this into place is the fact that a lot of criminals in what should we call them low-income neighborhoods, let's just leave it at that, and also a lot of illegal aliens are not one are going to get the vaccine and they're not one are going to get the vaccine passport because they don't want to have any interaction with the authorities on any level.
[02:30:19.019 --> 02:30:35.423]  It's the same case here in the UK which is why they had this big moral panic over BAME people not getting the vaccine and we have literal public relations campaigns every day where it's black and brown celebrities urging black and brown people to get the vaccine.
[02:30:36.463 --> 02:30:44.945]  Problem is a lot of them aren't going to do it because many of them are either illegal aliens or criminals and they don't want to have any interaction with
[02:30:46.011 --> 02:30:47.413]  Authorities on any level.
[02:30:47.633 --> 02:31:04.575]  And you're going to get that same process unfolding in the United States where there is low take-up, or at least not high enough take-up, of this Covid vaccine amongst black, brown people, amongst Mexican immigrants, both legal and illegal.
[02:31:05.430 --> 02:31:06.691]  So then it's racist, right?
[02:31:06.731 --> 02:31:08.012]  Then it's discriminatory.
[02:31:08.772 --> 02:31:16.777]  Are they going to stop the precious illegal aliens from entering grocery stores simply because they don't have a vaccine passport?
[02:31:17.737 --> 02:31:21.439]  That's when the rubber will really be the road.
[02:31:22.720 --> 02:31:25.622]  UK now considering digital face scanning to enter pubs.
[02:31:26.914 --> 02:31:28.835]  This is out of the London Times.
[02:31:28.915 --> 02:31:36.341]  As I said, for the past six months they said, oh no, we're not going to have vaccine passports domestically, and they're not going to be mandatory.
[02:31:36.601 --> 02:31:43.566]  You just won't be able to go to a football game, the cinema, a restaurant, or into a grocery store without one.
[02:31:44.006 --> 02:31:46.148]  But they're not mandatory and we're not behind them.
[02:31:46.408 --> 02:31:53.915]  We're just giving all these corporations £75,000 grants to create that very system.
[02:31:54.295 --> 02:31:55.896]  Oh, but it's not government policy.
[02:31:56.237 --> 02:32:02.562]  We're just going to tell all the corporations and all the businesses to enforce it and give them the money to develop it.
[02:32:02.922 --> 02:32:04.524]  But it's not government policy.
[02:32:06.024 --> 02:32:12.809]  The technology is being proposed as a solution to concerns that presenting vaccination status via an app on a phone will be too slow.
[02:32:13.229 --> 02:32:16.091]  So they said it was never going to happen, now it's happening.
[02:32:16.231 --> 02:32:17.452]  Don't go away, we'll be back.
[02:32:18.833 --> 02:32:31.702]  So maybe our only hope to defeat the vaccine passport, both in the US and in the UK, is the fact that now society worships criminals and illegal aliens as these god-like figures.
[02:32:32.566 --> 02:32:37.930]  And they're the ones who are not going to be taking the vaccine passport, as I said before the break, because they don't want to interact with the authorities.
[02:32:38.310 --> 02:32:52.559]  So when it gets to the point of being discriminatory and racist against those kind of people who are our new gods who we worship on a regular basis, maybe then they're going to run into problems trying to sell this overall to the general public.
[02:32:53.872 --> 02:32:55.193]  I was talking about this before the break.
[02:32:55.273 --> 02:32:57.995]  UK now considering digital face scanning to enter pubs.
[02:32:58.115 --> 02:32:58.896]  And that's the point.
[02:32:59.356 --> 02:33:02.638]  It's not just a little piece of card that you show to get in the door.
[02:33:03.079 --> 02:33:07.062]  It's going to be linked to the facial recognition system.
[02:33:07.962 --> 02:33:10.864]  And then that's going to be linked to your social credit score.
[02:33:11.165 --> 02:33:19.851]  They're literally rolling out communist Chinese style programs to get everybody into this system and then to link your personal behavior
[02:33:21.138 --> 02:33:27.724]  Again, maybe if you didn't social distance properly, because now they're going to have sensors and scanners in airports to check on that.
[02:33:28.344 --> 02:33:31.106]  Maybe you'll lose a couple of points on your social credit score.
[02:33:31.487 --> 02:33:33.909]  Maybe you posted something hateful on Twitter.
[02:33:34.589 --> 02:33:36.971]  You'll lose a couple of points on your social credit score.
[02:33:37.372 --> 02:33:41.075]  And then maybe it's too low for you to get into the cinema.
[02:33:41.415 --> 02:33:44.077]  It's too low for you to get into the baseball game.
[02:33:44.558 --> 02:33:47.300]  And maybe it's even too low for you to go and buy groceries.
[02:33:48.118 --> 02:33:51.060]  Sounds like a scientific dictatorship gone mad.
[02:33:51.921 --> 02:33:53.322]  And that's exactly what it is.
[02:33:53.843 --> 02:34:00.648]  Already being rolled out in China, people can't buy plane tickets, train tickets, they can't use public transport.
[02:34:01.528 --> 02:34:12.437]  And then of course the way it works, it's so insidious that if your friends and family then have relationships with you in terms of ones that are being tracked online and physically,
[02:34:13.402 --> 02:34:25.815]  If you're with them, or if they're posting something on your thread on Facebook or whatever, then not only do you lose social credit score points, they lose them too, merely for being associated with you.
[02:34:27.057 --> 02:34:39.307]  So it's not just about having the person live under a permanent state of de facto lockdown, not being able to engage in basic normal necessities and leisure activities, live a normal life.
[02:34:39.908 --> 02:34:41.049]  No, that's not enough.
[02:34:41.569 --> 02:34:49.195]  Now you have to be completely ostracized by your friends and family too, because they don't want to be captured in that same net.
[02:34:50.296 --> 02:34:51.837]  So insidious!
[02:34:52.838 --> 02:34:54.740]  Already happening in Communist China,
[02:34:55.549 --> 02:34:58.951]  Which was the model for the response to this pandemic.
[02:34:59.312 --> 02:35:06.317]  The country that is praised over and over again by our media, by our governments for their fantastic response to this crisis.
[02:35:06.997 --> 02:35:08.418]  They're now the example.
[02:35:08.798 --> 02:35:09.579]  They're the model.
[02:35:09.879 --> 02:35:13.782]  So is it any surprise that Biden is now talking about vaccine passports?
[02:35:14.222 --> 02:35:22.348]  Is it any surprise that in the UK two companies, Envyne and iProof, are working together on the system?
[02:35:23.502 --> 02:35:35.631]  This is facial recognition after being given a £75,000 grant by the government, the same government that told us for the past six months they will not introduce domestic vaccine passports.
[02:35:36.171 --> 02:35:39.854]  Now they're funding companies to do exactly that.
[02:35:42.195 --> 02:35:44.157]  Says whoever is standing on the door of the pub
[02:35:45.129 --> 02:35:49.972]  Is going to have to scan the certificate, read the name, date of birth and ask for the person for an ID document.
[02:35:50.432 --> 02:35:54.095]  Check that, check the name, the date of birth on the ID document are the same.
[02:35:54.635 --> 02:35:59.718]  Squint at the photograph on the ID document and then make sure that the person in front of them is that person.
[02:35:59.918 --> 02:36:01.940]  I approve CEO Andrew Budd said.
[02:36:01.960 --> 02:36:06.543]  To which the answer is, that's not going to happen.
[02:36:07.003 --> 02:36:09.965]  So they're selling it on the basis of convenience.
[02:36:11.045 --> 02:36:13.287]  Streamlining the process and that's true.
[02:36:14.122 --> 02:36:28.447]  If you go out on a Saturday night in a northern town like Liverpool or Newcastle or Sheffield, if you've ever been out on a Saturday night in those towns, not a very organised environment, let's put it that way.
[02:36:28.467 --> 02:36:33.629]  You've got people crammed into clubs, you've got people cramming into pubs.
[02:36:33.709 --> 02:36:38.071]  They would have lines going around the block if they had to go through all that process.
[02:36:38.091 --> 02:36:40.351]  So why not just scan your face?
[02:36:41.012 --> 02:36:42.152]  It's so much easier.
[02:36:43.018 --> 02:36:48.201]  He said it speeds the process up and it absolves people of what otherwise would be a very heavy responsibility.
[02:36:49.141 --> 02:36:55.164]  This is what the government is funding in the UK, having denied they were doing it for six months.
[02:36:55.524 --> 02:36:57.145]  It's not a vaccine passport.
[02:36:57.425 --> 02:36:59.787]  It's a digital identity card.
[02:36:59.807 --> 02:37:02.368]  You're going to be forced to carry it at all times.
[02:37:02.388 --> 02:37:11.913]  You're going to be forced to scan your face if they get their way to engage in basic commerce or other normal leisure activity.
[02:37:12.580 --> 02:37:20.426]  And we, by the same token, have journalists from the LA Times saying this is what's needed to, quote, break the resistance.
[02:37:22.528 --> 02:37:30.334]  If that sounds like it's out of a scientific dictatorship dystopian movie, then it's because we're basically living in that.
[02:37:30.594 --> 02:37:32.275]  This is our new normal.
[02:37:32.655 --> 02:37:33.676]  Isn't it fantastic?
[02:37:34.377 --> 02:37:39.641]  And then Marjorie Taylor Greene comes out and calls it for what it is, and she's crazy, she's insane.
[02:37:40.416 --> 02:37:46.260]  So they're admitting it, they're rolling it out, but then if you criticise it, you're insane, and it doesn't exist.
[02:37:46.381 --> 02:37:48.462]  They use that same tactic over and over again.
[02:37:49.623 --> 02:37:54.927]  Meanwhile, fake vaccine passports are already being sold on the street.
[02:37:56.348 --> 02:38:04.274]  Fake vaccine passports are already being sold by criminals on the streets, according to TV personality Andrew Grool, who said he saw it happen.
[02:38:05.839 --> 02:38:16.626]  This is a tweet in which Gruel, who is a chef from what I could tell from his bio, he's like a TV chef, said, had to work late last night, walked through a back alley to get to my car.
[02:38:17.246 --> 02:38:21.969]  There were two shady guys selling fake vaccine passports out the back of a Cadillac.
[02:38:22.629 --> 02:38:23.890]  A market is born.
[02:38:23.950 --> 02:38:29.233]  So maybe that's a way in which the criminals and the illegal aliens will get around the vaccine passport.
[02:38:29.273 --> 02:38:33.956]  Maybe they'll just buy a fake one from some criminal in the street.
[02:38:35.134 --> 02:38:41.338]  But then if you don't take one, if you refuse one, then you'll lose your social credit score points and you'll be on a list.
[02:38:43.239 --> 02:38:49.023]  Meanwhile in the UK, government minister says people should call out others for hugging their loved ones.
[02:38:49.083 --> 02:38:57.069]  Yes, after over a year of lockdown on and off in the UK where people were told they couldn't see their grandparents, never mind hug them,
[02:38:58.158 --> 02:39:04.542]  Even now it's supposedly easing up, the government is out saying you can't hug your own loved ones.
[02:39:04.602 --> 02:39:05.803]  In fact, they were out today.
[02:39:06.844 --> 02:39:11.347]  Basically, it was warm for the first time since last year.
[02:39:11.367 --> 02:39:17.210]  It was about 20 degrees Celsius, which is basically baking weather for this country.
[02:39:18.071 --> 02:39:22.414]  And as soon as the pictures began to emerge of, God forbid, people out in the parks,
[02:39:23.564 --> 02:39:28.226]  Then the government came out and said, enjoy the sun, but don't dare hug anyone.
[02:39:28.266 --> 02:39:36.289]  They've now come out, this is a government minister, Nigel Huddleston, who made the remarks during an interview spot on BBC Breakfast.
[02:39:36.309 --> 02:39:40.430]  He said, despite the temptation, please don't risk the health of your loved one by actually hugging them.
[02:39:41.031 --> 02:39:43.292]  By actually hugging them, my God!
[02:39:43.992 --> 02:39:48.173]  Before going on to suggest that people should intervene if they witness such dreadful behaviour.
[02:39:49.094 --> 02:39:51.275]  Imagine if you're 80 years old,
[02:39:53.266 --> 02:40:19.231]  And because of this fear-mongering, because of this relentless terror that you've been put through over the last year, you literally haven't left your tiny house, you haven't seen your grandchildren for a year, you're 80 years old, maybe you've got some chronic health condition, you know maybe you've only got 18 months to live, you haven't seen your grandkids in a month, and now the government is telling you that you can't hug them.
[02:40:20.350 --> 02:40:22.691]  What value is there left in that life?
[02:40:22.771 --> 02:40:37.394]  Wouldn't you rather take the risk, which even for people of that age, with chronic health conditions, even if they get the virus, I think the number is 95% plus they'll survive it, according to the CDC.
[02:40:38.114 --> 02:40:38.834]  So what are you going to do?
[02:40:38.934 --> 02:40:43.915]  Live in perpetual fear for the last 18 months of your life and completely waste it?
[02:40:43.935 --> 02:40:46.416]  Or are you going to hug your grandkids?
[02:40:46.476 --> 02:40:48.256]  Well, according to the government, you can't.
[02:40:50.586 --> 02:40:54.189]  Campaigner calls for two-year lockdown government permission to leave house.
[02:40:54.429 --> 02:40:58.492]  I thought this was a parody Twitter account but from what I could tell it's not.
[02:41:00.313 --> 02:41:06.617]  So again as I was talking about there's routinely high support in polls for lockdown in the United Kingdom.
[02:41:07.658 --> 02:41:09.119]  80% plus routinely when asked.
[02:41:09.659 --> 02:41:13.082]  Support the government lockdown and want it to be even more draconian
[02:41:14.167 --> 02:41:21.774]  Whether those polls are accurate, whether they're just phoning up terrified eight-year-old grandmas on the phone, on the house phone, remains to be seen.
[02:41:22.315 --> 02:41:36.048]  But a campaigner on Twitter is calling for the UK government to impose a lockdown that lasts for a minimum of two more years, as well as a law where citizens would have to apply for government permission to leave their homes, a system which they actually had in place in France.
[02:41:36.778 --> 02:41:39.038]  So this has driven people completely insane.
[02:41:39.058 --> 02:41:49.700]  We now have zero COVID extremists who want lockdown forever until we've eliminated every single case of COVID, which is never going to happen.
[02:41:49.820 --> 02:41:50.340]  Don't go away.
[02:41:50.380 --> 02:41:51.961]  Summit.News will be right back.
[02:41:53.341 --> 02:41:58.562]  Well, the CDC has come out and said that vaccinated people do not carry coronavirus.
[02:41:58.622 --> 02:42:04.203]  That's changed from before, where they said you could still carry the virus and spread it, even if you're vaccinated.
[02:42:04.980 --> 02:42:07.361]  Raising the question, well, what's the point in getting vaccinated?
[02:42:07.381 --> 02:42:11.184]  And they said, of course, well, this is why you have to continue wearing the masks.
[02:42:11.244 --> 02:42:16.887]  Well, if vaccinated people don't carry it, why are they still telling us to wear the masks?
[02:42:17.928 --> 02:42:22.831]  Then you have the WHO report into the origin of coronavirus.
[02:42:23.991 --> 02:42:25.972]  In fact, we had this headline a few days ago.
[02:42:26.973 --> 02:42:31.856]  Former CDC director tells CNN coronavirus likely escaped from Wuhan lab.
[02:42:32.765 --> 02:42:35.408]  Yes, that is the former CDC director.
[02:42:35.988 --> 02:42:39.892]  You'll get banned on YouTube or Twitter for saying that, but they can say it.
[02:42:41.013 --> 02:42:51.423]  He told CNN he believes the coronavirus may have escaped the Wuhan Institute of Virology as far back as September 2019, which would obviously mean that China covered it up.
[02:42:51.803 --> 02:42:53.545]  All but know China's the best.
[02:42:54.304 --> 02:42:57.305]  Their response is an example to the world, we're told.
[02:42:57.845 --> 02:43:08.688]  Even though they literally covered it up, lied to the WHO by saying there was no human-to-human transmission, yet were supposed to follow their model on everything, including vaccine passports.
[02:43:09.508 --> 02:43:15.270]  He said, I'm of the point of view I still think the most likely etiology of this pathogen in Wuhan was from a laboratory.
[02:43:15.850 --> 02:43:16.290]  Escaped.
[02:43:17.276 --> 02:43:20.417]  Other people don't believe that, that's fine, science will eventually figure it out.
[02:43:20.877 --> 02:43:45.167]  We're still being told that these bats from caves hundreds and hundreds of miles away brought the virus to Wuhan, and that they were then sold with these other animals in the wet market in Wuhan, and that it had nothing whatsoever to do with the fact that they were working with bat coronaviruses, almost a stone's throw away from this wet market in the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
[02:43:45.985 --> 02:43:53.071]  Now they're literally censoring children's books in Germany to hide the origin of this virus.
[02:43:53.491 --> 02:43:54.933]  This is how deep it goes.
[02:43:55.493 --> 02:44:03.079]  German publisher censors children's book that said coronavirus started in China at the behest of Beijing bullies.
[02:44:03.520 --> 02:44:05.021]  This is a publisher in Germany.
[02:44:05.882 --> 02:44:12.067]  They put out a book which was a guide for elementary schools and daycare centers to follow COVID safe procedures.
[02:44:12.607 --> 02:44:14.669]  And in this book they had the nerve
[02:44:15.560 --> 02:44:20.921]  They had the nerve to tell the truth that the coronavirus originated in China.
[02:44:22.081 --> 02:44:30.143]  Of course, you can't say that now, apparently, because it's racist and it's causing hate crimes, it's causing violent attacks on Asian Americans.
[02:44:30.523 --> 02:44:43.125]  When you actually look at the perpetrators of those hate crimes, well, let's just say they're from low-income neighborhoods, doesn't really tie into the white supremacy narrative that the media has going on with that.
[02:44:44.048 --> 02:44:55.337]  But now Beijing is so furious, they're so incandescent, they're so eager to control the narrative, they're even censoring German children's books!
[02:44:55.878 --> 02:44:58.880]  This book only had a reach of about several thousand copies!
[02:45:00.722 --> 02:45:04.264]  But it said the virus originated in China and it had to go.
[02:45:04.885 --> 02:45:13.512]  The Hamburg-based Chinese consulate threatened the publishing company with criminal charges if it didn't remove the book from circulation and issue a grovelling apology.
[02:45:14.249 --> 02:45:16.911]  Lo and behold, they removed the book from circulation.
[02:45:17.951 --> 02:45:28.698]  Colson Publishing House told DW that the company has stopped delivery of the book and a new edition with a different wording regarding the origins of the virus is already in the making.
[02:45:29.218 --> 02:45:30.198]  What are you going to do?
[02:45:31.099 --> 02:45:33.060]  How different is this wording going to be?
[02:45:33.080 --> 02:45:35.281]  Are you going to say it came from Timbuktu?
[02:45:35.321 --> 02:45:37.363]  Are you going to say it came from the moon?
[02:45:37.383 --> 02:45:39.304]  Are you going to say it came from Mars?
[02:45:39.844 --> 02:45:41.165]  It came from China!
[02:45:43.268 --> 02:45:45.510]  Almost certainly from that lab.
[02:45:46.590 --> 02:45:50.393]  The company explained it had been working on assumptions at the time the book was published.
[02:45:50.613 --> 02:45:51.493]  Oh, assumptions.
[02:45:51.574 --> 02:45:52.414]  You mean the truth.
[02:45:53.415 --> 02:45:55.576]  But that today we would no longer use this wording.
[02:45:56.257 --> 02:46:10.306]  So they caved in to a government located thousands of miles away because the local consulate complained that in this kid's book they said coronavirus originated in China, which it did.
[02:46:12.403 --> 02:46:21.109]  Political expert Ralph Weber says China is trying to create the false narrative that its only role in the pandemic was to successfully fight it off.
[02:46:21.789 --> 02:46:24.031]  And that's what we get from our media.
[02:46:24.591 --> 02:46:26.553]  Oh, shouldn't we praise China's response?
[02:46:27.173 --> 02:46:29.375]  Literally welding people in their own homes.
[02:46:31.176 --> 02:46:32.257]  Such a great response.
[02:46:33.077 --> 02:46:39.481]  Having lied about the origin of it, having lied about human-to-human transmission, isn't Beijing fantastic?
[02:46:39.722 --> 02:46:41.603]  No, they're evil and they covered it up.
[02:46:43.194 --> 02:46:47.198]  He said, quote, for a long time now China has been influencing cultural life in Europe.
[02:46:47.238 --> 02:46:49.080]  Perhaps we haven't noticed that so far.
[02:46:51.303 --> 02:46:59.692]  Chinese journalist Shi Ming explained how Beijing was overseeing a global propaganda campaign in an effort to absolve themselves of blame for the pandemic.
[02:47:00.112 --> 02:47:05.218]  A global propaganda campaign aided and abetted by our mainstream media.
[02:47:06.092 --> 02:47:10.897]  He said, quote, in the beginning the Chinese propaganda itself said that the disease had first started in China.
[02:47:11.218 --> 02:47:13.700]  It even referred to it as the Wuhan pneumonia.
[02:47:14.661 --> 02:47:20.107]  But now it wants to erase the memory of the virus's origins with a worldwide political correctness campaign.
[02:47:20.488 --> 02:47:28.116]  And they couldn't pull it off without our media, which has genuflected and grovelled at their knees at every step of the way.
[02:47:29.170 --> 02:47:36.674]  Particularly with this narrative that Asian hate crimes are happening because white people are saying the coronavirus came from China.
[02:47:37.135 --> 02:47:38.675]  One, it did come from China.
[02:47:38.875 --> 02:47:41.457]  Two, look at the perpetrators of those hate crimes.
[02:47:42.337 --> 02:47:44.078]  Not very white, let's just put it that way.
[02:47:45.939 --> 02:47:47.540]  So again, we go back to the Wuhan lab.
[02:47:47.580 --> 02:47:48.841]  We had this headline the other day.
[02:47:50.022 --> 02:47:55.645]  CCP's Useful Idiots, US Rep Slams WHO Covid Origin Whitewash Report.
[02:47:56.411 --> 02:48:10.056]  Republican representative Lee Zeldin blasted the World Health Organization as China's useful idiots after a draft version of its investigation into the origins of the coronavirus outbreak was revealed to have dismissed the lab leak theory as extremely unlikely.
[02:48:10.076 --> 02:48:19.259]  And again, as I explained before, they tested 45,000 animals in the area, all were found negative for COVID.
[02:48:19.619 --> 02:48:23.881]  They visited the Wuhan Institute of Virology for three hours
[02:48:25.091 --> 02:48:28.073]  And then ask them if they leaked it from the lab.
[02:48:28.253 --> 02:48:31.875]  And guess what the scientists in the Wuhan Institute of Virology said?
[02:48:32.555 --> 02:48:33.575]  Nothing to do with us.
[02:48:34.356 --> 02:48:35.276]  Oh, thanks for telling us.
[02:48:35.336 --> 02:48:35.617]  Bye.
[02:48:35.637 --> 02:48:36.617]  That was it.
[02:48:36.637 --> 02:48:38.838]  That was literally their investigation.
[02:48:38.918 --> 02:48:39.979]  Don't take my word for it.
[02:48:40.819 --> 02:48:46.662]  Take the word of Jamie Metzl, who in fact I think is a part of the WHO itself.
[02:48:46.702 --> 02:48:49.604]  You have whistleblowers coming out from within this organisation
[02:48:50.603 --> 02:48:53.065]  He appeared on CBS 60 Minutes on Sunday.
[02:48:53.225 --> 02:48:54.305]  This is another story.
[02:48:54.506 --> 02:48:58.608]  And actually, when they deserve praise, we should praise the media.
[02:49:00.269 --> 02:49:02.731]  Good on 60 Minutes for actually getting this out.
[02:49:02.771 --> 02:49:05.493]  Did it attract much other media attention?
[02:49:05.553 --> 02:49:06.493]  No, basically none.
[02:49:08.455 --> 02:49:10.536]  So Leslie Starr interviewed Jamie Metzl.
[02:49:11.849 --> 02:49:20.811]  Who said the WHO investigation was completely useless, comparing it to a study tour where scientists only saw what the CCP wanted them to see.
[02:49:21.271 --> 02:49:32.134]  This is like going on a tour of Pyongyang in North Korea with your government minders, telling you what you can take pictures of, telling you where you can go, telling you who you can speak to.
[02:49:32.374 --> 02:49:38.316]  That was literally what the WHO's investigation into the Wuhan lab was like.
[02:49:40.938 --> 02:49:42.199]  They didn't even investigate!
[02:49:42.219 --> 02:49:44.920]  They just asked them, did you leak this virus?
[02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:46.081]  No, we had nothing to do with it.
[02:49:46.261 --> 02:49:47.101]  All right, fine, bye.
[02:49:47.681 --> 02:49:48.301]  That was it.
[02:49:50.822 --> 02:49:54.224]  Metzl said, I wouldn't really call what happened now an investigation.
[02:49:55.524 --> 02:49:58.666]  It's essentially a highly chaperoned, highly curated study tour.
[02:49:59.346 --> 02:50:03.387]  He said, everybody around the world is imagining this is some kind of full investigation.
[02:50:03.828 --> 02:50:04.688]  It's not.
[02:50:05.888 --> 02:50:09.430]  This group of experts only saw what the Chinese government wanted them to see.
[02:50:11.218 --> 02:50:16.263]  He said, while they were there, they didn't demand access to the records and samples and key personnel.
[02:50:17.264 --> 02:50:26.134]  That's because of the ground rules China set with the WHO, which has never had the authority to make demands or enforce international protocols.
[02:50:27.375 --> 02:50:30.238]  And he made the comparison, he said it would be like
[02:50:31.104 --> 02:50:43.390]  If the US had let the Soviets run an international investigation into Chernobyl and just accepted the Soviets' explanation without any investigation, independent investigation, whatsoever.
[02:50:45.131 --> 02:50:46.112]  He asked the question.
[02:50:47.953 --> 02:50:53.756]  While the team went out on a four-week mission, two of those weeks were spent holed up a hotel in quarantine, so again,
[02:50:56.087 --> 02:51:03.351]  Once out, they had some tense exchanges with their counterparts, a team of Chinese experts, over their refusal to provide raw data.
[02:51:03.731 --> 02:51:05.912]  So they provided no raw data whatsoever.
[02:51:07.392 --> 02:51:16.597]  Article goes on to state, if the virus originated in animals, the key unanswered question is, how did the virus travel the thousand miles from the bat caves in southern China to Wuhan?
[02:51:16.617 --> 02:51:17.217]  I wonder.
[02:51:20.231 --> 02:51:36.665]  Meanwhile, the WHO chief himself, whose name is unpronounceable, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, that's my best effort, says... WHO chief says COVID-19 report too quick to dismiss theory virus leaked from Wuhan lab.
[02:51:37.946 --> 02:51:47.514]  He's come out and said even though the international team of scientists determined that a leak is the least likely hypothesis, yeah, after having a North Korean style Pyongyang tour of the lab,
[02:51:48.237 --> 02:51:50.138]  It requires further investigation.
[02:51:50.658 --> 02:51:55.881]  So now even the leader, the head of the WHO has come out and said he's not happy about it.
[02:51:56.701 --> 02:51:58.362]  So again, it remains to be seen.
[02:51:58.382 --> 02:52:09.648]  And of course we have CDC director chokes back tears as she fear mongers impending doom in the US based on a slight uptick of cases, which is basically immeasurable on a graph.
[02:52:09.688 --> 02:52:12.269]  So fourth lockdown, fourth wave coming.
[02:52:13.004 --> 02:52:14.205]  Scientific dictatorship.
[02:52:14.405 --> 02:52:15.725]  A lot to look forward to.
[02:52:15.765 --> 02:52:15.945]  That's it.
[02:52:16.006 --> 02:52:16.866]  War Room's coming up next.
[02:52:16.886 --> 02:52:17.626]  Summit.News.
[02:52:17.706 --> 02:52:18.207]  Don't go away.
[02:52:22.429 --> 02:52:27.211]  Remember, only way the dog hunts is you share the links from BandotVideo, InfoWars.com, and NewsWars.com.
[02:52:27.251 --> 02:52:30.113]  And I'll throw this out again, because when I plug, we're able to fund our operation.
[02:52:30.153 --> 02:52:32.114]  When I don't, we're close to being shut down.
[02:52:32.154 --> 02:52:33.774]  I'm not trying to be a victim here.
[02:52:33.794 --> 02:52:36.156]  I'm one hell of a fighter, and I've been blessed to be in this fight this long.
[02:52:36.556 --> 02:52:41.018]  But if you don't buy the products, we can't fight effectively, and the enemy will successfully shut us down.
[02:52:41.118 --> 02:52:44.240]  I got a lot of irons in the fire, a lot of stuff going on people don't even know about.
[02:52:44.380 --> 02:52:48.483]  And let's just say this, you see Info Wars, well we're doing a lot more than what you see there.
[02:52:48.503 --> 02:52:51.245]  The enemy's got all my phones tapped, they know what we're doing, it's all legal.
[02:52:51.946 --> 02:52:53.307]  But believe me, we've only begun to fight.
[02:52:53.687 --> 02:52:55.589]  I need a lot of capital if you want to win this fight.
[02:52:56.169 --> 02:52:59.892]  You can't spend your money anywhere that's got more bang for the buck.
[02:53:00.452 --> 02:53:01.073]  Guaranteed.
[02:53:01.373 --> 02:53:02.053]  Dollar for dollar.
[02:53:02.093 --> 02:53:02.734]  Pound for pound.
[02:53:02.774 --> 02:53:05.916]  We're the toughest, meanest, hardcore junkyard dog there is.
[02:53:06.276 --> 02:53:07.157]  Powered by God.
[02:53:07.217 --> 02:53:09.559]  You know, the Energizer bunnies powered by Energizer.
[02:53:09.599 --> 02:53:10.479]  We're powered by God.
[02:53:10.860 --> 02:53:11.480]  We're pathetic.
[02:53:11.760 --> 02:53:13.261]  This is just a flesh bag.
[02:53:13.561 --> 02:53:18.065]  I've got this little pathetic spirit that was made by God and I can see God and God shines through me.
[02:53:18.385 --> 02:53:19.205]  God shines through you.
[02:53:20.353 --> 02:53:21.634]  But I need a platform to attack.
[02:53:21.794 --> 02:53:23.314]  And I just want to attack the enemy with truth.
[02:53:23.394 --> 02:53:24.255]  So, please.
[02:53:24.615 --> 02:53:25.695]  You've got my commitment to go 110%.
[02:53:25.735 --> 02:53:26.596]  Sometimes I'm gonna fall.
[02:53:26.616 --> 02:53:27.436]  Sometimes I'm gonna fail.
[02:53:27.456 --> 02:53:29.217]  Sometimes I'm gonna stumble.
[02:53:29.257 --> 02:53:30.117]  Sometimes I'm gonna blow up.
[02:53:30.157 --> 02:53:31.558]  Sometimes I'm gonna make a fool out of myself.
[02:53:31.618 --> 02:53:32.338]  Because I'm real.
[02:53:32.618 --> 02:53:33.218]  And I'm a sinner.
[02:53:33.238 --> 02:53:33.999]  But I love God.
[02:53:34.019 --> 02:53:34.939]  And I love justice.
[02:53:35.039 --> 02:53:36.640]  And I need capital to fight this war.
[02:53:37.020 --> 02:53:45.085]  So, Vitamineral Fusion is the one thing, if you do anything, for you, for your children, especially if you've got grandparents or parents that are retired or in a nursing home that aren't getting a lot of sun.
[02:53:45.125 --> 02:53:47.546]  You know, the old smart old ladies and old men are out there gardening.
[02:53:47.606 --> 02:53:49.007]  Those are the guys that look like 100 years old.
[02:53:49.047 --> 02:53:51.409]  Well, if you're not getting your D3, you're going to be dead in a hammer.
[02:53:51.429 --> 02:53:52.690]  This has great D3.
[02:53:52.710 --> 02:53:54.491]  It's got all the other essential vitamins and minerals.
[02:53:54.951 --> 02:53:58.513]  96% reviews at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:53:58.633 --> 02:53:59.394]  It's back in stock 50
[02:53:59.974 --> 02:54:00.374]  I think so.
[02:54:28.274 --> 02:54:31.437]  You already saw the Roger Stone interview in Florida, got some other big ones coming up.
[02:54:31.757 --> 02:54:34.419]  We're busy beavers here, and you'll see it all here at the InfoWart.
[02:54:34.539 --> 02:54:38.522]  We believe in peace, but we are bringing you the war of information.
[02:54:38.963 --> 02:54:43.486]  And if you're gonna attempt to shut our speech down and attack us, we will defend ourselves!
[02:54:43.506 --> 02:54:45.088]  InfoWart!
[02:54:45.328 --> 02:54:46.549]  InfoWart!
[02:54:46.649 --> 02:54:47.930]  InfoWart!
[02:54:52.734 --> 02:54:54.095]  Well, we knew this news was coming.
[02:54:54.932 --> 02:54:57.915]  So I'm not pleased to be proven right yet again, but here it is.
[02:54:58.555 --> 02:54:59.976]  I've got CNBC.
[02:55:00.177 --> 02:55:01.578]  I've got CNBC.
[02:55:01.818 --> 02:55:03.199]  I've got the New York Post.
[02:55:03.740 --> 02:55:05.061]  I mean, I've got them all right here.
[02:55:06.482 --> 02:55:07.823]  And they say, oh, guess what?
[02:55:08.584 --> 02:55:09.685]  It's not a pandemic.
[02:55:10.686 --> 02:55:11.647]  It's endemic.
[02:55:12.427 --> 02:55:16.010]  They say America is racist and white people are inherently bad.
[02:55:16.571 --> 02:55:18.853]  Racism is endemic amongst them.
[02:55:19.804 --> 02:55:23.667]  Which is total racism by the establishment, by the left, trying to create a race war.
[02:55:24.488 --> 02:55:31.253]  Martin Luther King was right when he said, you judge people by the character of what they do and the content of their deeds.
[02:55:31.613 --> 02:55:32.814]  You don't do it off what color they are.
[02:55:32.834 --> 02:55:33.975]  But that's what they're saying.
[02:55:34.035 --> 02:55:37.297]  Well, now they're saying COVID's endemic.
[02:55:37.357 --> 02:55:41.160]  It's a common cold virus that Bill Gates manipulated and patented.
[02:55:41.200 --> 02:55:42.922]  So he owns it with Fauci and the UN.
[02:55:44.143 --> 02:55:47.525]  And so the vaccines aren't going to work and it's never going to go away.
[02:55:47.605 --> 02:55:49.747]  And Fauci said last week and Bill Gates said this week,
[02:55:50.134 --> 02:55:57.699]  That you still won't be able to go outside or go have a job or anything, because if one person dies of COVID in New Zealand or the U.S.
[02:55:57.719 --> 02:55:59.460]  or the U.K., no one can ever go outside again.
[02:56:00.161 --> 02:56:02.142]  People have always died of the flu and always died of the cold.
[02:56:02.202 --> 02:56:11.308]  And we know they've lied about the numbers from car wrecks and motorcycle wrecks and people with heart attacks and cancer and the flu and pneumonia.
[02:56:11.488 --> 02:56:13.329]  All of that, they admit, has been put in the column.
[02:56:13.349 --> 02:56:13.910]  But it doesn't matter.
[02:56:14.230 --> 02:56:15.911]  Don't question the science or you'll be censored.
[02:56:16.151 --> 02:56:16.812]  You'll be fired.
[02:56:17.552 --> 02:56:28.020]  And so the very people that cooked this up at Wuhan and launched it and lied to us about the death numbers, saying 4% would die, it wasn't even 1% to 1%, we're still supposed to listen to them.
[02:56:28.320 --> 02:56:31.022]  So here's the headline, experts say COVID could become endemic.
[02:56:31.863 --> 02:56:37.507]  What that means for you, and it goes on to say, oh, there'll be new versions, COVID-19, COVID-20, 2021, 2022.
[02:56:38.928 --> 02:56:41.690]  In fact, even major Hollywood producers
[02:56:43.410 --> 02:56:51.433]  Have movies coming out, like Songbird, about how the lockdown's never going to end, never going to stop, and soon there'll be camps and checkpoints.
[02:56:51.853 --> 02:56:52.834]  But that's just a movie, right?
[02:56:52.894 --> 02:57:02.378]  No, they have the contact tracers in Australia, in the UK, and now in Canada, arresting people that try to walk down the street, beating up women, beating up men, strip-searching them.
[02:57:02.898 --> 02:57:04.939]  This is the excuse for martial law.
[02:57:05.339 --> 02:57:13.102]  This is the excuse to take over the producers and break the will of the people that voted for Brexit, or voted for Trump, or voted for Bolsonaro.
[02:57:14.226 --> 02:57:17.987]  This is a authoritarian takeover and it's so incredibly criminal.
[02:57:18.167 --> 02:57:19.527]  Here's Bill Gates, CNBC.
[02:57:19.847 --> 02:57:20.948]  Bill Gates on mask.
[02:57:21.508 --> 02:57:25.509]  He goes on to say, if you're vaccinated, you can still transmit.
[02:57:26.289 --> 02:57:26.709]  Really?
[02:57:26.889 --> 02:57:27.369]  Wow.
[02:57:29.230 --> 02:57:30.570]  So now you can't go out.
[02:57:31.630 --> 02:57:33.411]  I'm not going to stop wearing mask.
[02:57:34.651 --> 02:57:38.012]  See, because they're never going to let go this power grab.
[02:57:38.472 --> 02:57:39.152]  It's a problem.
[02:57:40.157 --> 02:57:40.377]  I think?
[02:58:02.443 --> 02:58:05.325]  All I can tell you is they're coming for our children now.
[02:58:05.425 --> 02:58:10.448]  I've got the articles right here saying now they're going to come and basically give it to school children, the COVID-19 vaccine.
[02:58:10.728 --> 02:58:11.969]  What is an experimental vaccine?
[02:58:12.209 --> 02:58:15.531]  And they admit COVID doesn't even affect children and the vaccine's dangerous.
[02:58:15.951 --> 02:58:17.152]  This is so incredibly evil.
[02:58:17.512 --> 02:58:21.294]  So help us at InfoWars stay on air for however long God wants to keep us on air.
[02:58:21.734 --> 02:58:23.736]  And God's going to work through you to decide how long it's going to be.
[02:58:23.776 --> 02:58:25.256]  But I would get your supplements.
[02:58:25.677 --> 02:58:26.897]  I would get you preparing asylums.
[02:58:26.937 --> 02:58:27.878]  I'd get your storable food.
[02:58:27.978 --> 02:58:31.140]  I would get all those things at InfoWarsStore.com while you still can.
[02:58:31.519 --> 02:58:35.844]  And running through March 6th, we have 10% off of storable food and free shipping.
[02:58:35.864 --> 02:58:37.106]  That's a huge deal, never do that.

[02:58:41.731 --> 02:58:44.374]  So store-wide free shipping at MFootwearStore.com.

[02:58:49.360 --> 02:58:51.503]  But whatever you do, spread the word about the live broadcast.
