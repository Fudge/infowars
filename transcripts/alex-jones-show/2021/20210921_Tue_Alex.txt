[00:00:00.529 --> 00:00:06.072]  Watch the American Journal Weekday Mornings 8-11 Central at Band.Video.
[00:00:07.353 --> 00:00:13.597]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:13.617 --> 00:00:17.239]  The silent majority is no longer silent.
[00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.081]  This is The War Room with Owen Schroyer.
[00:00:22.402 --> 00:00:24.163]  Please stand by for further details.
[00:00:24.183 --> 00:00:26.404]  We return you now to your regularly scheduled program.
[00:00:27.153 --> 00:00:35.959]  Ladies and gentlemen, what is it going to be that breaks the back of the COVID-19 vaccine mandates and all the lies?
[00:00:39.381 --> 00:00:41.443]  Alex Jones is in the building.
[00:00:41.523 --> 00:00:42.944]  He's just landed.
[00:00:43.024 --> 00:00:44.525]  He's coming up just shortly.
[00:00:45.446 --> 00:00:46.907]  But folks, what is it going to be?
[00:00:47.007 --> 00:00:48.368]  Think about everything we've seen.
[00:00:48.468 --> 00:00:58.492]   First of all, the idea of forced medication should already be Illegal and despised but I guess we've passed that.
[00:00:58.872 --> 00:01:03.515]  Moderna says if you've taken the vaccine you're twice as likely to get COVID.
[00:01:04.451 --> 00:01:14.597]  Whether it's Oscar de la Hoya, or Chris Rock, or an Olympic gold medal swimmer from Australia, you get the COVID vaccine, you get COVID, you end up in the ICU.
[00:01:14.917 --> 00:01:18.779]  Whereas if you don't get the vaccine, you get COVID, you recover in a couple days, you're just fine.
[00:01:19.019 --> 00:01:31.686]  But now, Project Veritas, from inside the hospitals, has doctors and nurses telling undercover journalists, unknowingly, that the vaccine is BS, it doesn't work, and it's all a lie.
[00:01:31.886 --> 00:01:32.707]  Here's a short clip.
[00:01:33.874 --> 00:01:45.040]  It hasn't probably been done because the government doesn't want to show that the darn vaccine is full of... is full of... Tell us about who this person is.
[00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.783]  Dr. Gonzalez is one of our emergency room doctors at Phoenix Indian Medical Center.
[00:01:50.203 --> 00:01:51.224]  And she's a federal employee?
[00:01:51.284 --> 00:01:51.564]  Correct.
[00:01:51.884 --> 00:01:59.868]  Now you got this guy in room four who got his second dose of vaccine on Tuesday, has been short of breath.
[00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:01.709]  He's got thrombocortis?
[00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:02.150]  Yes!
[00:02:03.306 --> 00:02:04.886]  All of this is bullshit.
[00:02:04.946 --> 00:02:05.586]  And now, let's see.
[00:02:05.667 --> 00:02:08.187]  It's probably barocarditis due to the vaccine.
[00:02:08.267 --> 00:02:08.507]  Right.
[00:02:08.527 --> 00:02:10.648]  But now, they're not going to blame the vaccine.
[00:02:10.708 --> 00:02:11.668]  Well, and you know what?
[00:02:11.708 --> 00:02:14.328]  But he has an obligation to report that, doesn't he?
[00:02:14.428 --> 00:02:15.448]  They are not reporting.
[00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:15.989]  Right.
[00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:18.829]  Because they want to show it under the... Yeah.
[00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:21.030]  Under the... the... the map.
[00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.070]  What patient was she referring to?
[00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:29.091]  She was referring to that patient, that 30-something-year-old patient that had congestive heart failure.
[00:02:29.111 --> 00:02:29.871]  Congestive heart failure.
[00:02:29.951 --> 00:02:32.512]  And in that particular patient's case, it was not reported.
[00:02:33.171 --> 00:02:33.351]  No.
[00:02:34.072 --> 00:02:37.094]  The problem here, they are not doing the studies.
[00:02:37.254 --> 00:02:47.863]  People that have it, you know, and the people that have been vaccinated, they're not doing any antibody testing.
[00:02:48.123 --> 00:02:49.084]  It's super fishy.
[00:02:49.104 --> 00:02:51.066]  Not that it hasn't been done.
[00:02:51.306 --> 00:02:52.567]  It hasn't been published.
[00:02:53.488 --> 00:03:00.854]  It hasn't probably been done because the government doesn't want to show that the darn vaccine is full of...
[00:03:01.972 --> 00:03:08.085]  The government doesn't want to show that the vaccine is full of shit. It's not doing what its purpose was.
[00:03:08.767 --> 00:03:09.849]  May I see your badges?
[00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.982]  You're Jody O'Malley with the Department of Health and Human Services.
[00:03:16.002 --> 00:03:18.164]  This is a United States government identification.
[00:03:18.184 --> 00:03:19.744]  I'm looking at the CDC website.
[00:03:20.365 --> 00:03:24.627]  It says that you're required to report adverse events following vaccinations.
[00:03:25.548 --> 00:03:28.469]  One of those would be congestive heart failure.
[00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:29.590]  That's a huge one.
[00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.712]  Were there other instances that they didn't report?
[00:03:33.331 --> 00:03:38.333]  Oh, I've seen dozens of people come in with an adverse reaction.
[00:03:38.533 --> 00:03:39.514]  It's really sad.
[00:03:40.274 --> 00:03:42.915]  She had just come back from surgery, from leave.
[00:03:43.695 --> 00:03:44.556]  So what are we looking at here?
[00:03:46.516 --> 00:03:55.960]  You're looking at me transferring her to a higher level of care that could handle her condition.
[00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.482]  And this is a colleague at your hospital who got sick.
[00:04:01.161 --> 00:04:04.384]  She didn't want to take it because of her religious beliefs.
[00:04:05.825 --> 00:04:07.527]  And she was coerced into taking it.
[00:04:08.913 --> 00:04:11.295]  Why are you choosing to blow the whistle?
[00:04:11.315 --> 00:04:13.436]  It's not what a lot of people would do.
[00:04:13.476 --> 00:04:14.297]  They're scared.
[00:04:14.337 --> 00:04:14.977]  They're afraid.
[00:04:15.858 --> 00:04:16.438]  Are you afraid?
[00:04:16.818 --> 00:04:22.822]  I wouldn't necessarily say I'm afraid because my faith lies in God and not man.
[00:04:23.242 --> 00:04:26.064]  This is evil at the highest level.
[00:04:26.624 --> 00:04:27.765]  You have the FDA.
[00:04:28.505 --> 00:04:32.788]  You have the CDC that are both supposed to be protecting us.
[00:04:33.188 --> 00:04:35.150]  Are you afraid they're going to retaliate against you?
[00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.710]  Yeah.
[00:04:36.874 --> 00:04:37.775]  I'm a federal employee.
[00:04:37.795 --> 00:04:39.736]  What other federal employees you see coming out?
[00:04:40.196 --> 00:04:41.697]  But you put your faith in God.
[00:04:42.318 --> 00:04:42.678]  Amen.
[00:04:44.299 --> 00:04:45.380]  There you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.001]  That's just a small clip.
[00:04:47.381 --> 00:04:49.303]  The full video is about 13 minutes.
[00:04:50.043 --> 00:05:00.751]  COVID vaccine exposed from inside the hospitals with federal government workers calling it out as a hoax and a tool of death.
[00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.511]  So she says the vaccine isn't doing what it was intended to do.
[00:05:05.331 --> 00:05:06.511]  Sadly, yes, it is.
[00:05:07.352 --> 00:05:12.893]  It's killed 15,000 people so far this year that they've admitted that they've actually admitted to.
[00:05:13.433 --> 00:05:18.295]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's a historic September 21st, 2021.
[00:05:20.295 --> 00:05:29.838]  Because Joe Biden at the UN has announced this is the factotum of a president.
[00:05:30.714 --> 00:05:39.702]  The Biden regime that is in the White House announced to the UN today that America surrenders to the New World Order.
[00:05:40.503 --> 00:05:40.983]  That's right.
[00:05:41.163 --> 00:05:56.697]  Joe Biden today in a speech that he was fumbling and stammering through, of course, announced to the world and to the UN that he surrenders the United States of America and our sovereignty and our prosperity to the will of the New World Order.
[00:05:58.806 --> 00:06:02.690]  Now, having said that, the American people are more awake than ever before.
[00:06:03.751 --> 00:06:24.109]  You just saw a short clip from the most recent Project Veritas video from inside hospitals with a federal health worker whistleblower telling you everybody knows the vaccine is BS, everybody knows it's not working, everybody knows it's causing heart attacks and killing people, and they're all covering it up and they don't know what to do about it.
[00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:32.960]  They see the death, they see the side effects, they know everyone that's coming in with COVID that goes into the ICU has been vaccinated, and they don't get it.
[00:06:33.541 --> 00:06:35.983]  Well, it's time to take the next leap, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:06:37.926 --> 00:06:39.327]  COVID was created in a lab.
[00:06:39.387 --> 00:06:43.733]  It was then used to lock down the planet and destroy the economic systems of the West.
[00:06:45.191 --> 00:06:51.295]  It was also then used to bring in the vaccine that is actually causing now the vaccine variant pandemic.
[00:06:51.635 --> 00:07:09.828]  Most people that get the vaccine variant still aren't going to die, but they're panicked because the media tells them it's the worst and most deadly virus ever, so they go to the ICU, they get remdesivir, it ruins their kidneys, fills their lungs with liquid, and then they get put on a ventilator and their lungs blow out and killed.
[00:07:10.809 --> 00:07:20.892]   You did not see an increase In the percentage of the death in the United States of America in 2020, the year of the deadly pandemic, not a single percentage increase in the death rate.
[00:07:21.612 --> 00:07:27.813]  I do predict you will see an increase in the death rate in the year 2021 because of the vaccines.
[00:07:29.834 --> 00:07:42.837]  Now, Black Lives Matter in the year 2020 was able to engage in complete lawlessness and criminality, whether it was in the name of George Floyd or somebody else that the media built up.
[00:07:44.451 --> 00:07:46.252]  And of course we saw what happened last year.
[00:07:46.312 --> 00:07:55.177]  But now, Black Lives Matter is standing up against vaccine mandates, having demonstrations and protests against vaccine mandates.
[00:07:56.077 --> 00:08:04.582]  Well, if Black Lives Matter starts to loot and riot and assault against vaccine mandates, will the media still call it mostly peaceful?
[00:08:04.902 --> 00:08:07.604]  Will law enforcement be told to stand down and let it happen?
[00:08:07.964 --> 00:08:08.905]  We may find out.
[00:08:09.725 --> 00:08:10.927]  We may find out indeed.
[00:08:11.188 --> 00:08:21.365]  Can Americans finally come together against this forced medication with an on-record deadly vaccine that they knew would cause death before they even released it?
[00:08:21.566 --> 00:08:23.268]  We have the PowerPoints from October.
[00:08:25.305 --> 00:08:26.946]  What an incredible time to be alive.
[00:08:26.986 --> 00:08:44.833]  The juxtaposition of Joe Biden sitting in the White House with the Biden regime, surrendering the United States to the New World Order today, as America is waking up and becoming more empowered as citizens than ever before, realizing the assaults against our civil rights.
[00:08:46.621 --> 00:09:02.086]  Owen Schroer sitting in for Alex Jones right now, but Alex Jones is in the building and he will be joining us very shortly to break all of this down, not to mention what's happening in Brazil where Bolsonaro is now the leader of the free world.
[00:09:03.647 --> 00:09:13.310]  Bolsonaro, it turns out, is everything that Donald Trump, well, or I guess I should say everything we wish Donald Trump would have been.
[00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:19.185]   Brazilian President Guys, put that headline back up from News Wars, thank you.
[00:09:19.986 --> 00:09:25.295]  Brazilian President Bolsonaro forced to eat pizza on sidewalk in New York because he's not vaccinated.
[00:09:26.434 --> 00:09:31.377]  Now they have this big UN General Assembly in New York where all of the elite have gathered.
[00:09:31.717 --> 00:09:35.419]  No travel restrictions, no mask mandates, no vaccine mandates for them.
[00:09:35.739 --> 00:09:43.443]  But for you, the slave, for you, the prisoner, you're subjected to the medical tyranny, but not the global elite.
[00:09:43.743 --> 00:09:49.647]  And Bolsonaro is now the only one in a position of leadership on the world stage standing against it.
[00:09:50.547 --> 00:09:51.948]  We salute Bolsonaro.
[00:09:52.548 --> 00:09:55.630]  We salute our Brazilians fighting for freedom.
[00:09:57.383 --> 00:09:59.024]  Brazilians unvaccinated.
[00:09:59.064 --> 00:10:03.147]  Bolsonaro appears to break UN vaccine honor system during address.
[00:10:03.687 --> 00:10:05.829]  No, none of them have been vaccinated.
[00:10:06.189 --> 00:10:08.991]  That's why it wasn't a mandate for the UN General Assembly.
[00:10:09.251 --> 00:10:11.873]  Bolsonaro is the only one that's being honest about it.
[00:10:14.074 --> 00:10:17.757]  And then, of course, you just saw it in the Project Veritas video.
[00:10:17.837 --> 00:10:20.839]  Federal government whistleblower goes public with secret recordings.
[00:10:21.359 --> 00:10:24.841]  Government doesn't want to show the COVID vaccine is full of shit.
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.842]  Shove adverse effect reporting under the mat.
[00:10:28.882 --> 00:10:30.564]  Now folks, I know I'm not about to curse.
[00:10:30.664 --> 00:10:31.404]  I'm a journalist.
[00:10:31.685 --> 00:10:38.730]  This is what is said by the federal worker in the video that the vaccine is full of crap.
[00:10:39.031 --> 00:10:40.172]  Now I'm censoring myself.
[00:10:43.314 --> 00:10:44.415]  What is it going to take?
[00:10:45.316 --> 00:10:51.181]  I interviewed a reporter and former police officer from Australia this morning.
[00:10:52.301 --> 00:10:56.025]  Where the scenes in Australia are getting worse and worse by the day.
[00:10:56.125 --> 00:10:58.747]  Something has to give in Australia.
[00:10:58.847 --> 00:10:59.868]  What is going to break first?
[00:10:59.908 --> 00:11:07.035]  We saw violent confrontations and combat between Australian citizens and police today.
[00:11:07.556 --> 00:11:10.539]  This is what the New World Order is setting up, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:27.573]   You need to understand, it's now been announced by Biden today, the world elite That the left claims to stand against, you know, the tax the rich, how the 0.1% have 99% of the world's wealth, you know, those old talking points.
[00:11:29.993 --> 00:11:36.134]  They have created a situation where they are building a breakaway civilization.
[00:11:37.154 --> 00:11:38.675]  They have no need for us anymore.
[00:11:39.315 --> 00:11:53.557]   They've experimented on us enough to have their new technologies and life extension technologies, and they're now In the case of Australia, attempting to incite a civil war between the police and the citizens, something has to give.
[00:11:53.757 --> 00:11:54.918]  The citizens have had enough.
[00:11:55.398 --> 00:11:58.941]  Will the police willingly be the foot soldiers for the New World Order?
[00:11:59.081 --> 00:12:00.362]  Or will they stand down?
[00:12:00.763 --> 00:12:02.384]  I think we're going to find out soon.
[00:12:03.765 --> 00:12:04.646]  But understand this.
[00:12:06.206 --> 00:12:15.491]  The world elite have been building and are now ready to execute the next phase of their breakaway civilization from the rest of humanity.
[00:12:16.072 --> 00:12:28.639]  And all the stuff that you're seeing, all the death from the vaccines, the viruses being made in labs, the pitting humans against one another, whether it's skin color or law enforcement versus civilians, it's all part of the global agenda.
[00:12:29.059 --> 00:12:30.379]  Biden announced it today.
[00:12:30.699 --> 00:12:34.000]  He said, in the next 10 years, the world has to change.
[00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:35.360]  It's going to be a decisive time.
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:56.765]  Meaning, the world elite are about to take over the planet, put you into a prison-type system, force-inoculate you with deadly vaccines, and have complete control over your body, your travel, your speech, and all of your rights, as you know them, will be gone if they are successful.
[00:12:58.114 --> 00:13:06.840]  But just like what you're seeing in Australia with the citizens being pit against the police and that's now getting violent, the whole world is starting to wake up to this, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:07.640]  And here's the thing.
[00:13:09.041 --> 00:13:14.025]  InfoWars has been the tip of the spear in alerting the planet that this is happening.
[00:13:14.425 --> 00:13:21.350]  We are now in the phase of this plan that is so obvious, most people are now starting to see what's going on.
[00:13:22.901 --> 00:13:25.463]  This is why InfoWars was targeted for censorship.
[00:13:26.004 --> 00:13:28.045]  This is why InfoWars is attacked so much.
[00:13:28.226 --> 00:13:33.890]  Much of the stuff that goes on behind the scenes, which you may never even know about, maybe someday we'll be able to talk about it.
[00:13:35.231 --> 00:13:37.974]  But this is the current state of the planet, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:39.847 --> 00:13:45.949]  And I think it's going to come a time in the very, very near future where there is no more hedging.
[00:13:46.169 --> 00:13:47.670]  There is no more neutral ground.
[00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:52.912]  You're going to have to draw a line in the sand and you're going to have to decide which line of the sand that you're going to stand on.
[00:13:53.032 --> 00:14:02.255]  Now, a lot of people have already decided, I'm with the globalists, I'm with the New World Order, I'm with the big government, I want to be a slave, I want to live in fear.
[00:14:02.575 --> 00:14:04.636]  For whatever reason, you've witnessed that.
[00:14:06.476 --> 00:14:18.032]   But everybody in this audience He's going to have to make some serious choices in the very near future about what planet they want to live on in humanity's time on this planet going forward.
[00:14:18.613 --> 00:14:20.734]  Do you want to be a slave to medical tyranny?
[00:14:21.074 --> 00:14:22.756]  Do you want to live in a prison planet?
[00:14:23.816 --> 00:14:26.458]  Do you want the government telling you how to live your life?
[00:14:26.919 --> 00:14:30.201]  Do you want to be ruled by world elite, rich elite?
[00:14:31.914 --> 00:14:39.400]  Or do you believe that you have the right to self-government, the right to free speech, the right to self-defense, and everything else?
[00:14:39.601 --> 00:14:43.624]  Alex Jones in the house, joining us in four minutes.
[00:14:43.924 --> 00:14:45.726]  Historic times, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:45.966 --> 00:14:46.647]  We'll be right back.
[00:14:47.427 --> 00:15:03.403]  Okay, so I got off the airplane there at the airport just about 30 minutes ago, and the crew got me here very, very quickly, and I just skidded into my chair here with Owen Schroeder, but sometimes here on the Alex Jones Show, sometimes I have my best broadcast.
[00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:11.834]  When I haven't actually gotten super prepared because I tend to get prepared at night and during the morning and then get in here and go over the huge stacks of news here.
[00:15:11.854 --> 00:15:19.859]  That's why you saw those big stacks that had not even been looked at because Owen did his own research where he came on and he's going to be hosting his own broadcast 3 to 6 p.m.
[00:15:20.399 --> 00:15:21.820]  Central Standard Time today.
[00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:24.582]  I think you guys what Owen's letting you know is that TV's off right there.
[00:15:25.022 --> 00:15:26.523]  No big deal, but just a heads up on that.
[00:15:27.512 --> 00:15:29.974]  So, here we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:30.074 --> 00:15:31.074]  What a time to be here.
[00:15:31.114 --> 00:15:32.996]  I'm very blessed to be back in Austin, Texas.
[00:15:33.636 --> 00:15:34.637]  I was in D.C.
[00:15:35.877 --> 00:15:46.482]   and then I drove through the beautiful Mountain country there in the Appalachias to be on Tim Pool's show, right on the border of West Virginia and Maryland.
[00:15:47.283 --> 00:15:48.283]  And that was really interesting.
[00:15:48.323 --> 00:15:49.764]  I did like four hours with him last night.
[00:15:49.824 --> 00:15:53.747]  His regular podcast is a couple hours on his subscription podcast.
[00:15:53.787 --> 00:15:55.368]  And I have a lot of things to say.
[00:15:55.388 --> 00:16:00.331]  I also read on the flight back this morning, scanned over three newspapers.
[00:16:00.351 --> 00:16:03.272]  And it's just unbelievable what the general public's reading on these things.
[00:16:03.313 --> 00:16:06.875]  In fact, I think when I do a podcast three days a week, I'm going to start doing it at night.
[00:16:07.495 --> 00:16:09.537]  To be commercial free just for, you know, folks to watch.
[00:16:10.057 --> 00:16:12.079]  I'm going to have a deal where I just look at what's in newspapers.
[00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:23.210]  Because we look at all the news online, all the video clips, everything, and kind of look at the leftist sites, mainstream sites, government sites, documents, legislation, what people shoot, video they get, what people say on Twitter, Facebook, you know, a wide spectrum.
[00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:28.495]   But man, for folks opening up newspapers, it is Just bonkers BS.
[00:16:28.535 --> 00:16:33.781]  Like, oh my gosh, the Pfizer shot's totally still effective and it's totally effective in children.
[00:16:33.962 --> 00:16:35.303]  You'll never get COVID-19.
[00:16:35.343 --> 00:16:39.368]  They're still lying at the level Biden is where it's totally protected.
[00:16:39.668 --> 00:16:40.389]  Total lie.
[00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:41.911]  I mean, it is crazy.
[00:16:41.931 --> 00:16:44.232]   Plus, Potty training cows.
[00:16:45.213 --> 00:16:48.054]  That was in the Washington Post science section.
[00:16:48.094 --> 00:16:53.015]  They're not just connecting colostomy bags to cows because their defecation, they say, is toxic.
[00:16:53.396 --> 00:16:54.316]  They put off methane.
[00:16:54.336 --> 00:16:56.317]  There's always been animals putting off methane.
[00:16:56.336 --> 00:17:00.635]   There's always been a wild bovine, from the water buffalo of the world to the yaks,
[00:17:00.635 --> 00:17:03.856]  to the bison here on our plains.
[00:17:03.856 --> 00:17:05.855]  In fact, just as many bovines as we have now.
[00:17:05.855 --> 00:17:06.855]  But it's all just a lie.
[00:17:06.855 --> 00:17:09.656]  Oh, everything animals do is evil now.
[00:17:09.656 --> 00:17:16.096]   So in Germany in places, they now make the cows, or they shock them, go into a bathroom stall
[00:17:16.096 --> 00:17:21.603]   where they contain all the methane and everything, Anything a carbon-based life form puts off is evil.
[00:17:21.883 --> 00:17:22.944]  I have that stack right here.
[00:17:23.224 --> 00:17:24.305]  That's the kind of stuff I have.
[00:17:24.606 --> 00:17:25.166]  Look, look right here.
[00:17:25.466 --> 00:17:29.430]  Will consumers find upcycled food appetizing?
[00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:32.052]  Dumpster food on your plate, the newest trendy thing.
[00:17:32.392 --> 00:17:35.275]  And then this is all agenda 21, agenda 20, 30, Klaus Schwab stuff.
[00:17:35.535 --> 00:17:39.218]  Then right next to it, to fight climate change, scientists potty train cows.
[00:17:40.479 --> 00:17:45.584]   So see, I am not I am not making any of this up.
[00:17:46.084 --> 00:17:48.405]  Owen, we're going to get into it all here today.
[00:17:48.425 --> 00:17:50.125]  What do you make of just the crazy time we're in?
[00:17:50.445 --> 00:17:51.685]  Don't you understand, Alex?
[00:17:51.726 --> 00:17:55.247]  This planet is for Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab only.
[00:17:55.587 --> 00:17:56.207]  I'm for cows.
[00:17:56.267 --> 00:17:59.008]  Not for cows, not for dogs, not for humans.
[00:17:59.268 --> 00:18:00.708]  Only the global elite, Alex.
[00:18:01.108 --> 00:18:02.989]  You will take their deadly vaccines.
[00:18:03.669 --> 00:18:09.275]  You will lock yourself in your home until you die, and you will eat little tiny plant-based protein bars.
[00:18:09.315 --> 00:18:12.318]  You'll get one a day, and you're going to shut up and be a good slave, Alex.
[00:18:12.719 --> 00:18:19.706]  And it's now official because I read the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, and the Washington Post.
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:22.481]  Okay, so I picked those up before we got on the plane.
[00:18:22.601 --> 00:18:24.141]  Yikes, just the trash of the world.
[00:18:24.541 --> 00:18:28.922]  And, I mean, my brain, after three and a half hours flying back, feels like it's been sucked out of my head.
[00:18:28.942 --> 00:18:31.023]  You should try watching The View for half an hour.
[00:18:31.543 --> 00:18:41.566]  And they had this whole article just groveling to Xi Jinping, but saying, oh, he's bitch-slapped us, but that's okay, he's a real communist, we wish we were like him.
[00:18:42.606 --> 00:18:45.288]  I mean, this is just fruit loop level.
[00:18:45.688 --> 00:18:52.774]  And oh, communism works so well, that's why China is at a 10% growth rate until recently, until the last, you know, five years, and it's still at 6 or 7%.
[00:18:52.894 --> 00:18:59.479]  And it's just, no, because they did one-sided trade deals where all our jobs went there because the globalists brokered it.
[00:18:59.519 --> 00:19:03.942]  I mean, the crap they feed people, the mainstream news is basically cyanide.
[00:19:04.362 --> 00:19:05.203]  Cyanide to freedom.
[00:19:05.652 --> 00:19:14.800]  Yeah, and think about, too, how we have this massive invasion at the southern border, and we're justified in saying, well, we have to take these people in.
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:16.221]  Look at the countries they came from.
[00:19:16.241 --> 00:19:17.882]  Well, what's wrong with the countries they came from?
[00:19:18.163 --> 00:19:19.204]  They're communists!
[00:19:19.284 --> 00:19:20.084]  Oh, that's the best part.
[00:19:20.104 --> 00:19:27.130]  The Wall Street Journal has Haitians swimming across the Rio Grande saying, border patrol agents under investigation because the reign of a horse was hanging over.
[00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:29.472]  Yeah, they tried to stop people illegally coming across.
[00:19:30.533 --> 00:19:33.636]  And then meanwhile, but oh, they're trying to swim into the white supremacist country.
[00:19:33.916 --> 00:19:34.556]  We're just bad.
[00:19:34.776 --> 00:19:36.137]  Oh, we want the racists to get us!
[00:19:36.617 --> 00:19:37.538]  Oh, please!
[00:19:37.878 --> 00:19:38.058]  Oh!
[00:19:38.098 --> 00:19:40.780]  Yeah, freakin' bad, but everyone races to come to it.
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:47.063]  Oh, America racists, but all the quote-unquote minority groups that aren't even really minorities are racing to come here.
[00:19:47.103 --> 00:19:50.765]  And Alex, you know, the one thing about Justin Trudeau... Oh, still in the election?
[00:19:51.545 --> 00:19:58.792]  Well, I mean, we can get into those results, but the one thing about Trudeau is he actually, he says the things that they're not supposed to say out loud.
[00:19:58.832 --> 00:19:59.212]  You ever notice?
[00:19:59.232 --> 00:20:01.635]  He says, I want to be a dictator like Xi Jinping.
[00:20:02.095 --> 00:20:06.659]  And then somebody tells you a dictator, then they have the same mail-in ballot stuff, and it doesn't match the numbers.
[00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:08.601]  He barely still won.
[00:20:08.621 --> 00:20:09.322]  They have a parliament.
[00:20:09.642 --> 00:20:10.723]  So he's a lame duck.
[00:20:11.064 --> 00:20:12.325]  He doesn't have a majority government.
[00:20:13.223 --> 00:20:20.427]  And he said, he said yesterday, he said, we're going to treat the climate crisis just like we treated the COVID crisis, meaning you're going to be enslaved.
[00:20:20.507 --> 00:20:21.327]  Well, that's what they always said.
[00:20:21.347 --> 00:20:24.709]  They always said this is going to segue from lockdowns for this to lockdowns for that.
[00:20:24.749 --> 00:20:26.250]  There's going to be a carbon app on your phone.
[00:20:27.139 --> 00:20:29.221]  And now they are just announcing all of it.
[00:20:29.241 --> 00:20:30.461]  They're just coming forward with all of it.
[00:20:30.562 --> 00:20:33.764]  And in Australia, things are getting violent, clashing between the police.
[00:20:33.804 --> 00:20:36.266]  Oh my God, it's like Road Warrior, which is where the film's based.
[00:20:36.706 --> 00:20:37.266]  Did you know?
[00:20:37.286 --> 00:20:41.789]  But I mean, I've got all the articles right here, but what's wrong with eating trash?
[00:20:41.809 --> 00:20:44.531]  There's actually an article about how incredible it is.
[00:20:44.832 --> 00:20:44.952]  Oh.
[00:20:45.172 --> 00:20:51.236]  And let me ask, will you consume up-cycled foods?
[00:20:52.197 --> 00:20:52.657]  I'm asking you.
[00:20:52.737 --> 00:20:52.897]  No.
[00:20:53.258 --> 00:20:54.218]  It says it's garbage.
[00:20:54.238 --> 00:20:54.839]  You want to eat garbage?
[00:20:56.377 --> 00:20:57.838]  No, uh, no.
[00:20:57.978 --> 00:21:01.421]  I like steak dinners and potatoes and fresh veggies.
[00:21:01.841 --> 00:21:04.763]  But notice, they don't criticize, like, GMO food.
[00:21:04.803 --> 00:21:06.845]  They don't criticize McDonald's.
[00:21:06.865 --> 00:21:09.246]  They don't criticize stuff that isn't even food that's toxic for you.
[00:21:09.587 --> 00:21:13.850]  It's all about you need to have less calories for the earth, and it needs to come from bug protein.
[00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:16.751]  We need you to eat bugs, not cows, bugs.
[00:21:17.171 --> 00:21:23.453]  And the irony too is, Alex, you know, for the most part, people have been eating trash for the last 30 years in America.
[00:21:23.473 --> 00:21:28.215]  I mean, it's well-researched that people do throw away a lot of food and they shouldn't, but that doesn't mean we now eat bugs.
[00:21:28.515 --> 00:21:34.257]  See, and that's one thing, if you wanted to have a discuss about less, less, you know, waste of food and stuff, hey, we can have that discussion.
[00:21:34.277 --> 00:21:35.138]  That's not what this is.
[00:21:35.178 --> 00:21:36.838]  This is just totalitarian government.
[00:21:36.918 --> 00:21:38.259]  We have a poster on the wall.
[00:21:38.239 --> 00:21:41.838]   totalitarianism dressing up as moral. We have a poster on the wall that says from
[00:21:41.838 --> 00:21:44.958]   World War II that says food is a weapon don't waste it. So people really
[00:21:44.958 --> 00:21:47.798]   shouldn't waste food and I'm saying myself included. You got something in the
[00:21:47.798 --> 00:21:52.798]   damn refrigerator eat it. Okay? And that's just trying to be a better person and
[00:21:52.798 --> 00:21:56.597]   live by example. But notice the left pushes though take out on everybody and the new
[00:21:56.597 --> 00:22:00.038]   economy is you're gonna be a driver of the takeout when statistically it's not
[00:22:00.038 --> 00:22:04.838]  it's the most unhealthy food. It exploits people that do it.
[00:22:02.899 --> 00:22:04.580]  You don't eat the food in your refrigerator.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.362]  And I'm not saying I don't order takeout sometimes, but I'm trying not to.
[00:22:07.682 --> 00:22:08.843]  It's much better just to cook at home.
[00:22:08.903 --> 00:22:09.904]  It's a normal thing to cook.
[00:22:10.164 --> 00:22:12.266]  It's like farming or roofing or anything.
[00:22:12.546 --> 00:22:13.346]  It's fun to cook.
[00:22:13.366 --> 00:22:14.927]  You're meant to mess with your food.
[00:22:14.947 --> 00:22:16.409]  But people don't even know how to cook anymore.
[00:22:16.689 --> 00:22:16.889]  Yeah.
[00:22:17.329 --> 00:22:30.771]   And again, though, the research has been done, whether it's McDonald's or other fast foods, but I think McDonald's is the one that's the most researched, is that When you eat a steady diet of fast food, the gut bacteria just disappears.
[00:22:30.831 --> 00:22:32.192]  It just completely disappears.
[00:22:32.212 --> 00:22:34.853]  That's because McDonald's, as you know, has been irradiated and everything.
[00:22:35.293 --> 00:22:37.094]  It doesn't die under a dish.
[00:22:37.614 --> 00:22:39.815]  A regular hamburger is like rotting in three days.
[00:22:40.036 --> 00:22:41.956]  But under a dish, McDonald's doesn't die.
[00:22:41.996 --> 00:22:42.457]  It's eternal.
[00:22:42.477 --> 00:22:43.077]  It's like plastic.
[00:22:43.337 --> 00:22:51.687]  So they've really been, again, people want to have a McDonald's burger, okay, I'm not saying it's a, you know, have a McDonald's burger if you want, I'm just saying, we've already been eating trash.
[00:22:51.827 --> 00:22:54.550]  They've already been feeding us things that are unhealthy.
[00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:57.413]  Now they're just going public and making it standard.
[00:22:57.453 --> 00:22:57.593]  Exactly.
[00:22:58.074 --> 00:23:01.057]  I'm not saying I won't eat a Sonic Chili Cheese Dog.
[00:23:01.698 --> 00:23:03.659]  You might as well take a shotgun to your colon with that.
[00:23:04.039 --> 00:23:05.100]  But I mean, it's damn good.
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:06.861]  I might sneak one in once a month.
[00:23:06.901 --> 00:23:08.242]  But yeah, you're not going to eat it every day.
[00:23:08.282 --> 00:23:10.783]  Well, I mean, I just know I'm abusing myself.
[00:23:11.143 --> 00:23:12.444]  Let's not tell lies here.
[00:23:12.544 --> 00:23:13.284]  But that's your right.
[00:23:13.985 --> 00:23:14.665]  That's your right.
[00:23:14.865 --> 00:23:15.405]  Absolutely.
[00:23:15.445 --> 00:23:15.806]  All right.
[00:23:15.866 --> 00:23:16.686]  We'll be right back.
[00:23:16.726 --> 00:23:17.226]  Stay with us.
[00:23:17.246 --> 00:23:17.907]  But hey, listen.
[00:23:18.607 --> 00:23:20.528]  Sonic coming up with your bug burger.
[00:23:21.429 --> 00:23:22.569]  They're not really folks.
[00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:23.250]  Upcycled.
[00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:32.635]  Alright, thank you so much for tuning in to the heart of the resistance against the globalist takeover as they mop up the final areas of free speech around the planet.
[00:23:33.396 --> 00:23:36.978]  We sit here and watch Congress refuse to take action.
[00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:40.531]  But do you know who did take action?
[00:23:40.551 --> 00:23:43.893]  I have it right here in this weekend's Wall Street Journal.
[00:23:44.774 --> 00:23:58.743]  Xi Jinping has decided to basically kick out a lot of big tech corporations or demand that they take Chinese party members that are high level, even in the Politburo, onto their board of directors, which Apple and others have done.
[00:23:58.763 --> 00:24:04.767]  That would give them the code keys to everybody's iPhones and Apple devices.
[00:24:04.807 --> 00:24:20.276]   That was actually, again, in the wall Street Journal this weekend in a big article about Xi Jinping cracking down on capitalism and saying, we are communists, we're going to be communists, we're going to dominate the world with international communism.
[00:24:21.516 --> 00:24:25.879]  And about how he took down Jack Ma and Alibaba and all the rest of it.
[00:24:25.899 --> 00:24:34.664]   And he says, my final decision, he said this at a speech that they released a transcript of to the communists at a
[00:24:34.664 --> 00:24:41.864]   private hotel heavily guarded last year was when they took in the winter right after the election
[00:24:41.864 --> 00:24:43.785]  Trump's Twitter away.
[00:24:43.785 --> 00:24:50.505]   And when they started censoring the US Senate, Xi Jinping said our main enemy, we've already
[00:24:50.505 --> 00:24:55.704]   conquered basically the American government, our main enemy now is going to be big tech
[00:24:55.704 --> 00:24:57.144]  and the globalist.
[00:24:57.335 --> 00:25:05.002]  And so I actually have all these giant papers together here in my hands and I was just looking during the break trying to find the Xi Jinping part, but I will.
[00:25:05.762 --> 00:25:10.286]  It was a huge long article and I'm going to read some of that to you, but we already knew all this.
[00:25:11.207 --> 00:25:20.612]  But it was just crazy that they actually put it out in the official elite communist publication that in Chinese translate to English to in search of truth.
[00:25:21.572 --> 00:25:23.913]  And so I'm reading transcripts of in search of truth.
[00:25:24.274 --> 00:25:27.375]  I went looked it up myself and found it in Chinese English news.
[00:25:27.675 --> 00:25:28.616]  I didn't just believe this.
[00:25:30.396 --> 00:25:34.178]  And I looked it up on, you know, Wi-Fi, and sure enough, it was true.
[00:25:34.759 --> 00:25:41.163]  And so whenever we've had guests on that have said Xi Jinping's becoming like Putin, this big person in opposition to globalism...
[00:25:42.341 --> 00:25:42.921]  It was happening.
[00:25:42.941 --> 00:25:49.026]  So that made me think of Justin Trudeau, who the experts agree, and Trump's got the analysis and I agree with him.
[00:25:49.446 --> 00:25:51.067]  You saw massive election fraud in 2020.
[00:25:51.347 --> 00:25:52.408]  You saw it in California.
[00:25:52.728 --> 00:26:01.374]  Almost every Republican that went to vote being told, oh sorry, somebody voted for the Democrat operative in your name.
[00:26:02.035 --> 00:26:04.577]  That clearly that's going on, but there's such a landslide.
[00:26:06.111 --> 00:26:15.058]  against Trudeau that he still lost control of the parliament because again it's a parliamentary system where it's like their Congress basically goes in the general election as well.
[00:26:15.518 --> 00:26:37.972]   So he is a lame duck and that has now unfolded because they've only got so many people off the voting rolls they've put back on only so many people that died only so many people that have moved to another province just like in Florida and Texas they had a reservoir of that in the 2020 election to be able to beat Trump. They were going to give Biden,
[00:26:37.972 --> 00:26:39.252]  Texas and Florida a claim.
[00:26:39.252 --> 00:26:43.252]   Everything went blue. Democrats were saying that was happening to create a psychological
[00:26:43.252 --> 00:26:47.492]   demoralization to make us believe the fraud. It would just be so big and overwhelming.
[00:26:47.492 --> 00:26:50.932]   But they ran out of the dead voters, the people that had moved out of state
[00:26:50.932 --> 00:26:54.852]   and people that had stopped voting but were still on the rolls.
[00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:58.944]  That database, that was the big thing that came out of Mike Lindell's event that nobody gave attention.
[00:26:59.224 --> 00:27:03.909]  He had a real analyst on showing the real numbers and then showing how people lived in other states or had died.
[00:27:04.329 --> 00:27:09.714]  And so the same thing happened in Canada, is they just ran out of bullets.
[00:27:09.814 --> 00:27:14.458]  And the way they describe it is like a hill where you've got to go basically, you know, 170 to get over the hill.
[00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:19.881]  But they only have so many votes, so much gas, you only get basically a hundred.
[00:27:20.522 --> 00:27:28.585]  And so in Texas and in Florida, the answer is total landslides can overwhelm fraud because they only have so many votes they can put in, Owen.
[00:27:28.785 --> 00:27:29.965]  So they've got big problems.
[00:27:30.005 --> 00:27:37.208]  And I also noticed a theme in the Washington Post that was, oh, Trump's crazy.
[00:27:37.248 --> 00:27:38.809]  The new religion was the headline.
[00:27:39.799 --> 00:27:44.678]   of the Republican Party is election fraud, but they separately had articles about Belarus being
[00:27:44.678 --> 00:27:50.039]   a fraud. They separately had fraud about all these other countries they don't like and how
[00:27:50.039 --> 00:27:55.558]   their elections can't be trusted and how their elections aren't transparent. And of course,
[00:27:55.558 --> 00:27:58.519]   obviously, they were showing a bunch of nations and different articles.
[00:27:58.519 --> 00:28:03.479]   Oh, their election looks like a scam. And oh, this election isn't transparent because there's people
[00:28:03.479 --> 00:28:04.440]  they don't like getting in.
[00:28:04.567 --> 00:28:06.028]  Well, we're not just doing that here.
[00:28:06.348 --> 00:28:08.209]  Obama really won the election both times.
[00:28:08.509 --> 00:28:09.770]  People bought into his BS.
[00:28:10.091 --> 00:28:13.153]  But that's not what's happening with Joe Biden, and we all know it.
[00:28:14.175 --> 00:28:26.400]  Well, and remember just a month ago, the Democrats were calling for an audit of the recall election because they knew that Newsom was legitimately behind, at least on the straight up recall vote.
[00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:28.561]  They know that there were probably more recall votes than not.
[00:28:28.581 --> 00:28:31.742]  So they were saying, oh, we need to audit this before it even happened.
[00:28:31.762 --> 00:28:33.282]  Then they got the result that they wanted.
[00:28:33.582 --> 00:28:34.503]  And it was like.
[00:28:35.461 --> 00:28:39.682]  Almost 10 million less votes than the 2020 presidential election in California, magically.
[00:28:40.043 --> 00:28:42.463]  And so then all of a sudden they stopped wanting to call for audits.
[00:28:42.764 --> 00:28:47.585]  Of course, we had the Russian interference and meddling narrative for two years.
[00:28:47.605 --> 00:28:49.266]  I guess that doesn't count anymore either.
[00:28:49.686 --> 00:28:53.327]  But you asked me in the break, what is the biggest news story right now, Alex?
[00:28:53.347 --> 00:28:54.608]  And it's hard to really say.
[00:28:55.328 --> 00:28:57.989]  Is it the inevitable fate?
[00:28:59.089 --> 00:29:05.936]  Of Australia where physical violence seems to be in the near future of police versus citizens.
[00:29:06.316 --> 00:29:14.784]  Yesterday we had a doctor on that explained to me why, I mean this should be it Alex, 99% of COVID deaths happen in hospitals.
[00:29:15.865 --> 00:29:16.886]  Why would that be?
[00:29:16.946 --> 00:29:18.368]  How does that not alarm people?
[00:29:18.868 --> 00:29:28.193]   It's because the way they treat you is what kills you and that's been admitted and that's what's crazy is That last year it was totally made up and the hospitals are killing everybody.
[00:29:28.633 --> 00:29:30.155]  This year they've released something.
[00:29:30.476 --> 00:29:32.418]  Most scientists believe it's coming out of the vaccine.
[00:29:32.438 --> 00:29:35.762]  Even the FDA had a hearing Saturday saying we believe it came out of the vaccine.
[00:29:36.082 --> 00:29:36.503]  I don't know.
[00:29:37.123 --> 00:29:41.308]  I know that I check, talk to hospitals, and I make calls around the country.
[00:29:41.949 --> 00:29:44.011]  Four months ago, it was only hitting Texas and Florida.
[00:29:44.031 --> 00:29:45.352]  We were hit at the exact same time.
[00:29:45.993 --> 00:29:53.740]  Going back a year and a half ago, a lot of experts I respect, like General Flynn, believed it had been artificially released in only three areas around the world.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.482]  And so that's not how these plagues work.
[00:29:56.502 --> 00:29:59.825]  It's not how new viruses work unless it's been artificially released.
[00:30:00.186 --> 00:30:01.287]  And then they would keep spreading.
[00:30:01.527 --> 00:30:01.967]  It didn't.
[00:30:02.728 --> 00:30:04.730]  And so now they're hitting the Midwest.
[00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:06.291]  Now they're hitting Kansas and Missouri.
[00:30:06.872 --> 00:30:08.073]  Now they're hitting Oklahoma.
[00:30:08.573 --> 00:30:18.102]  And now they're hitting, you know, other conservative just enclaves are being hit and all the money is on that this globalist consortium is releasing and hell, I mean...
[00:30:18.905 --> 00:30:24.910]  They cooked up the stuff at Wuhan, they made the virus, they did gain the function, they stand to gain, they were game to virus will be released.
[00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:30.194]  All the evidence points towards it's an ongoing bio-attack and I'm really concerned about what they're going to release next.
[00:30:30.854 --> 00:30:38.300]  And more and more is coming out about Fauci's involvement with the Chinese Communist military, funding at least 60 projects that we know of.
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:40.862]  Some of the latest reports are insinuating it's over 200.
[00:30:42.783 --> 00:30:49.046]  Say that again though, as more documents come out, because we had hundreds last year, now it's hundreds and hundreds more this year of him saying gain of function.
[00:30:49.506 --> 00:30:52.347]  He was the bag man directly with the Chinese military.
[00:30:52.387 --> 00:30:55.788]  So he's literally the equivalent of Hitler 2.0.
[00:30:55.888 --> 00:30:58.910]  I mean, this guy is the absolute enemy of humanity.
[00:30:59.270 --> 00:31:01.471]  Imagine though, we have a list.
[00:31:01.571 --> 00:31:02.071]  This isn't...
[00:31:02.791 --> 00:31:04.493]  Hearsay, this isn't conjecture.
[00:31:04.533 --> 00:31:11.659]  We have a list of politicians or government workers that we know have colluded with China.
[00:31:12.019 --> 00:31:17.944]  Joe Biden, General Milley, Anthony Fauci, Dianne Feinstein, Eric Swalwell.
[00:31:18.064 --> 00:31:24.629]  By the way, let me just tell folks, they're a little bit, they're showing us from what we talked about a few minutes ago, this is Australia, people blocking the roads all over the country.
[00:31:24.689 --> 00:31:25.030]  Keep going.
[00:31:25.546 --> 00:31:27.047]  And it's just descending into chaos there.
[00:31:27.067 --> 00:31:27.967]  But this is inevitable.
[00:31:28.007 --> 00:31:31.709]  And I'm afraid that the fate of Australia also goes the fate of the world.
[00:31:32.309 --> 00:31:43.393]  You know, they haven't been able to have the COVID tyranny in America as much as Australia because we still have enough people here that live to be free and business owners and politicians that don't want to do this.
[00:31:43.433 --> 00:31:44.694]  But they're slowly encroaching.
[00:31:44.754 --> 00:31:46.555]  And Biden announced today at the U.N.
[00:31:46.595 --> 00:31:48.815]  he's surrendering the United States to the New World Order.
[00:31:48.855 --> 00:31:50.096]  That's why our border is open.
[00:31:50.116 --> 00:31:52.257]  You know, we should probably get that video for next hour.
[00:31:52.757 --> 00:31:54.578]  In fact, get Biden from the UN, please.
[00:31:54.598 --> 00:31:55.498]  I forgot I meant to do that.
[00:31:55.638 --> 00:31:56.059]  They have it.
[00:31:56.979 --> 00:32:00.461]  We covered it this morning on the American Journal, so they should be able to pull that in quite easily.
[00:32:01.481 --> 00:32:03.022]  But it's eventually going to come here, Alex.
[00:32:03.082 --> 00:32:05.623]  And Biden even said, this is a decisive decade.
[00:32:05.903 --> 00:32:06.424]  The U.S.
[00:32:06.504 --> 00:32:12.026]  is surrendering to the will of the New World Order, and we have choices to make now to stop COVID and climate change.
[00:32:12.046 --> 00:32:13.307]  They're announcing, you're done!
[00:32:13.807 --> 00:32:14.287]  You're done!
[00:32:14.367 --> 00:32:21.051]   You as a free citizen, And let's announce they're announcing every form of wealth, from cows to chickens to fish.
[00:32:21.171 --> 00:32:22.092]  Oh, they want to be in your bed!
[00:32:22.132 --> 00:32:25.554]  They're now announcing trees create carbon, so you can't grow those.
[00:32:26.054 --> 00:32:27.375]  Now the left says trees are bad.
[00:32:27.635 --> 00:32:29.756]  They want to dictate everything to you.
[00:32:30.156 --> 00:32:31.237]  You understand that, folks?
[00:32:31.317 --> 00:32:33.198]  This is a post-industrial world.
[00:32:33.218 --> 00:32:34.759]  So we're going to look at Canada, what happened there.
[00:32:34.779 --> 00:32:36.880]  We're going to look at Biden's big speech at the UN.
[00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:37.781]  Glad you reminded me of that.
[00:32:39.639 --> 00:32:42.880]  Project Veritas James O'Keefe with that huge news coming out.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:43.240]  Woo!
[00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:46.721]  But I want to talk to you about what do you think of all this news, the biggest story is?
[00:32:47.201 --> 00:32:49.942]  Because they're all big but they all like Russian dolls fit together.
[00:32:50.342 --> 00:32:51.582]  It's the new world order!
[00:32:51.802 --> 00:32:56.183]  The border's collapsing, the forced inoculations, the global IDs, all of it is the same system.
[00:32:56.643 --> 00:33:00.084]  Alright, Owen Schroer here riding shotgun with me throughout the entire broadcast today.
[00:33:00.124 --> 00:33:02.005]  We're shaking stuff up because we like to do it.
[00:33:02.465 --> 00:33:06.266]  He hosted American Journal that Harrison Smith normally hosts at 8 a.m.
[00:33:06.406 --> 00:33:11.200]   every And today, Harrison's going to be hosting The War Room!
[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:12.381]  And I'm shaking it up more than that!
[00:33:12.401 --> 00:33:16.544]  A couple weeks, I'm going to host out of the old studio that I used to host out of.
[00:33:17.044 --> 00:33:17.905]  Talk about nostalgia.
[00:33:17.985 --> 00:33:19.206]  And then Owen's going to host out of here.
[00:33:19.507 --> 00:33:20.728]  We're just going to mix it up.
[00:33:21.268 --> 00:33:23.810]  And then later, I'm going to host out of Harrison's studio.
[00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:26.172]  Everybody cross-trained on all the equipment.
[00:33:26.332 --> 00:33:33.839]  And just again, shake it up for all the great TV viewers and listeners and radio listeners that are out there with this great crew that makes it all possible.
[00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:35.300]  Owen!
[00:33:37.133 --> 00:33:39.453]  I knew what they would do, but it's the same tactic every time.
[00:33:39.633 --> 00:34:04.018]  When you had all these FDA boards, including the top board, come out Friday and Saturday and vote nearly unanimously in both boards, 16 to 2, 26 to 2, 26 to 1, that we shouldn't have boosters, and you shouldn't inject under 16, and this drug is failing, and it isn't protecting people, and it's not a vaccine, and it's down to 39% with the Pfizer shot, and that's even with studies the drug company gives them.
[00:34:04.038 --> 00:34:06.078]  Moderna's down to 50-something percent.
[00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:09.412]  And their answer is they just put out new fake studies.
[00:34:09.652 --> 00:34:11.434]  Oh, Pfizer says it's safe in children.
[00:34:11.934 --> 00:34:14.637]  All the leftists that brought their children in, little babies, to be injected.
[00:34:14.657 --> 00:34:19.481]  I mean, they really want our children, even though even the so-called Delta variant doesn't really hurt children.
[00:34:19.521 --> 00:34:21.202]  Gives them a sore throat, maybe their lungs hurt.
[00:34:21.983 --> 00:34:23.424]  There's so much stuff being put out.
[00:34:23.464 --> 00:34:25.846]  We know we're being lied to on every front.
[00:34:26.447 --> 00:34:34.790]   To me now, seeing it all just glazed over, and Fauci spent it Saturday on singing, and he goes, The clip was on Infowars.com.
[00:34:34.830 --> 00:34:35.531]  I'm sure a lot of you saw it.
[00:34:35.551 --> 00:34:36.231]  It was all over the news.
[00:34:36.271 --> 00:34:36.992]  They play it everywhere.
[00:34:37.012 --> 00:34:40.635]  He's like, this shows the system works, that we're not doing boosters right now.
[00:34:41.015 --> 00:34:43.257]  But we are going to give the children shots, as he's been saying.
[00:34:43.657 --> 00:34:45.459]  In October, they're going to legalize it.
[00:34:45.959 --> 00:34:50.583]  They're going to authorize it through emergency with one-third the injection of the Pfizer.
[00:34:50.983 --> 00:34:56.748]  I mean, they really want to do it because this, the evidence is showing, we know, turns off the white blood cell killer T's.
[00:34:56.788 --> 00:34:57.929]  They don't know if it does it forever.
[00:34:58.309 --> 00:35:00.691]  You know Fauci's done all these other clandestine tests.
[00:35:00.731 --> 00:35:01.151]  They know.
[00:35:02.012 --> 00:35:04.236]  So again, how do they think they're going to get away with this?
[00:35:04.577 --> 00:35:08.283]  With just new stories, new viruses, new scams, new fear.
[00:35:08.364 --> 00:35:12.050]  But to sit back and see them not just go after their dumb constituents.
[00:35:12.869 --> 00:35:15.748]   who they want to kill, who they don't want to pay their pension funds to.
[00:35:15.748 --> 00:35:20.068]   But to see them now go after children, metaphysically and spiritually level,
[00:35:20.068 --> 00:35:26.468]   who don't have what you'd really call full free will yet, that's why you have the sexual consent
[00:35:26.468 --> 00:35:35.588]   age at 17 or 18, that's why you've got the liquor age at 21, things like nicotine at 21, gambling.
[00:35:35.588 --> 00:35:39.269]   Because this is something, okay, you're an adult, you can destroy your life if you want,
[00:35:39.269 --> 00:35:43.748]   but we don't do this to children. But everything about the left is, oh, in Europe and Canada and
[00:35:43.748 --> 00:35:47.749]   Australia and everywhere, oh, we're going to give your five-year-old a shot even if you don't like
[00:35:47.749 --> 00:35:52.389]   it. They can make the decision. And oh, children in California, they're trying to pass a law if
[00:35:52.389 --> 00:35:59.317]   they're gay, can have sex when they're 12. And And the same senator that legalized giving people HIV and hepatitis, he has that bill under his.
[00:35:59.337 --> 00:36:02.980]  So, they're making a run at our children, and at free will, and at our future.
[00:36:03.281 --> 00:36:04.802]  And it is truly satanic, Owen.
[00:36:05.022 --> 00:36:09.526]  Well, it's training the children at a young age that the concept of freedom doesn't even exist.
[00:36:09.707 --> 00:36:11.468]  So, you shouldn't even have that notion.
[00:36:11.808 --> 00:36:14.751]  And then the sexualization of them is just a whole other level of it.
[00:36:15.712 --> 00:36:21.957]  But remember last week Fauci was on TV and he said he was asked about natural immunity and he just says, oh I don't know about natural immunity.
[00:36:21.997 --> 00:36:22.797]  I haven't looked into that.
[00:36:22.817 --> 00:36:23.057]  What?
[00:36:23.077 --> 00:36:24.378]  What do you mean you haven't looked?
[00:36:24.398 --> 00:36:25.419]  What do you mean you don't know about it?
[00:36:25.439 --> 00:36:26.160]  That's like Pluto.
[00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:27.100]  I've never heard of that.
[00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:27.661]  What's that?
[00:36:27.741 --> 00:36:28.561]  I'm an astronaut.
[00:36:28.621 --> 00:36:29.242]  The moon?
[00:36:29.362 --> 00:36:30.463]  I don't know about the moon.
[00:36:30.503 --> 00:36:31.663]  What's that goofy thing?
[00:36:31.703 --> 00:36:32.504]  I never heard of the moon.
[00:36:32.564 --> 00:36:33.385]  I'll look into the moon.
[00:36:33.425 --> 00:36:34.285]  I'm just an astronaut.
[00:36:34.345 --> 00:36:35.967]  I work for NASA but I don't know about the moon.
[00:36:36.807 --> 00:36:42.970]  And so Johnson & Johnson also came out today and said that you need a booster every two months now, Alex.
[00:36:43.050 --> 00:36:43.791]  Every two months.
[00:36:43.911 --> 00:36:45.592]  And I told you that was coming because it was in the...
[00:36:46.969 --> 00:36:48.389]  A year and a half ago, that's what Gates said.
[00:36:48.409 --> 00:36:50.030]  He goes, you're going to get a shot every few months.
[00:36:50.410 --> 00:36:51.710]  People are like, how does Jones know this?
[00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:53.370]  Because they tell you!
[00:36:53.851 --> 00:36:57.131]  By the way, this was just something that was just kind of off the wall.
[00:36:57.151 --> 00:36:59.292]  I had the doctor on yesterday that was such a powerful interview.
[00:36:59.312 --> 00:37:00.212]  It needs 10 million views.
[00:37:00.252 --> 00:37:02.753]  It needs 100 million views, quite frankly, with Dr. Artis.
[00:37:02.773 --> 00:37:04.693]  But he's going to be back on with me on The War Room next week.
[00:37:05.033 --> 00:37:09.434]  And I asked him a question off air because I didn't want to sound like a complete moron asking this question.
[00:37:09.514 --> 00:37:12.495]  It's just one of those basic things that you don't think to ask.
[00:37:12.935 --> 00:37:15.218]  And I said, uh, I said, Doc, why?
[00:37:15.619 --> 00:37:20.466]  You talk about any intravenous treatment or drug use, you go right into the vein, right?
[00:37:20.506 --> 00:37:22.148]  You find the vein, you go right into the vein.
[00:37:22.749 --> 00:37:26.855]  How come with vaccines, you just willy-nilly stick it in the arm and God knows what happens?
[00:37:27.055 --> 00:37:27.616]  And you know what he said?
[00:37:27.636 --> 00:37:29.238]  He said, I don't know.
[00:37:30.452 --> 00:37:31.753]  He said, I have no idea, actually.
[00:37:31.893 --> 00:37:32.713]  So think about that!
[00:37:33.414 --> 00:37:33.814]  What is it?
[00:37:34.054 --> 00:37:35.875]  Where is the vaccine even going?
[00:37:36.396 --> 00:37:40.819]  What scientific purpose does this vaccine just going willy-nilly into your arm?
[00:37:41.599 --> 00:37:45.902]  They actually put the lipid on it so it goes through the blood-brain barrier, where it's not supposed to go.
[00:37:45.942 --> 00:37:46.722]  They do that directly.
[00:37:46.762 --> 00:37:47.983]  But let's just pull back.
[00:37:48.023 --> 00:37:48.444]  Let me show...
[00:37:49.344 --> 00:37:51.327]  TV viewers this, and I'll describe it for radio listeners.
[00:37:51.767 --> 00:37:54.150]  This is one page out of the Washington Post, E4.
[00:37:54.571 --> 00:37:55.352]  Okay?
[00:37:55.913 --> 00:37:57.355]  It's the same page.
[00:37:58.095 --> 00:37:59.277]  And the whole paper is like this.
[00:37:59.938 --> 00:38:04.364]  Will consumers find upcycled foods appetizing garbage?
[00:38:05.589 --> 00:38:06.690]  They're going to make school kids eat it.
[00:38:07.491 --> 00:38:08.031]  Another article.
[00:38:08.051 --> 00:38:10.694]  To fight climate change, scientists potty train cows.
[00:38:11.155 --> 00:38:14.238]  Because they're saying their methane, their gas is toxic.
[00:38:14.318 --> 00:38:16.860]  Even though there have been bovine all over the surface of the planet forever.
[00:38:17.161 --> 00:38:19.763]  From Africa to the Americas to Asia to everywhere.
[00:38:20.304 --> 00:38:24.087]  And they estimate actually higher numbers in many areas of cows that are out now.
[00:38:24.108 --> 00:38:25.068]  These are just domesticated.
[00:38:26.108 --> 00:38:31.077]  Like a pig turns into a wild boar after about a year, grows long hair, tusks when it gets outside the pen.
[00:38:31.838 --> 00:38:36.706]  So cows go wild once they've lived outside as well and then you have it domesticated.
[00:38:39.145 --> 00:38:41.326]  Again, all women must have cesareans.
[00:38:41.546 --> 00:38:44.227]  All of us must be given a gene therapy that gets rid of our immune system.
[00:38:44.247 --> 00:38:48.548]  We've got to have all these new things every few months for whatever's out there because they've erased our immune system.
[00:38:48.768 --> 00:38:52.169]  And then it gives you basically barracks disease in humans and creates super viruses.
[00:38:52.589 --> 00:38:53.910]  That's the mainline science.
[00:38:55.110 --> 00:38:56.851]  So that's where all this is going.
[00:38:56.871 --> 00:39:02.833]  And now they're sticking tubes in the rear ends of cows and they wear a big giant bag on their back in Canada and Germany.
[00:39:03.552 --> 00:39:04.832]  and torture them.
[00:39:04.832 --> 00:39:05.951]  And the animal rights people love it.
[00:39:05.951 --> 00:39:07.751]  Oh, it's stopping their farts.
[00:39:07.751 --> 00:39:11.391]  Folks, there've always been creatures on this planet.
[00:39:11.391 --> 00:39:17.151]   Plankton pass gas, fish pass gas, turkeys pass gas, elephants do it.
[00:39:17.151 --> 00:39:18.832]  It's our damn atmosphere.
[00:39:18.832 --> 00:39:24.312]   But they're telling you that gas from cows is bad 'cause it's a giant industry they wanna target
[00:39:24.312 --> 00:39:26.231]  and take over and restrict, okay?
[00:39:26.231 --> 00:39:29.872]   And they're telling you you'll get like, you know, one piece of meat a year officially.
[00:39:30.001 --> 00:39:33.784]  So, just when I show you this, they're making life artificial.
[00:39:34.125 --> 00:39:35.786]  They don't want babies getting mother's milk.
[00:39:36.027 --> 00:39:37.949]  They don't want women having children vaginally.
[00:39:38.229 --> 00:39:40.471]  They don't want children to learn their own immune system.
[00:39:40.671 --> 00:39:43.194]  They want pod people and pod cows.
[00:39:43.394 --> 00:39:46.237]  And they want to shove giant hoses up the rear ends of cows.
[00:39:46.417 --> 00:39:50.181]  By the way, you can type in, cows now wearing fart bags as the headline.
[00:39:50.621 --> 00:39:56.086]  They have thousands of cows in Canada and they torture with bags hooked up to them.
[00:39:56.446 --> 00:39:58.047]  So this isn't a joke, okay?
[00:39:58.067 --> 00:39:59.388]  Yeah, there's a fart bag on a cow.
[00:39:59.769 --> 00:40:01.670]  So this is not a joke, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:40:01.690 --> 00:40:04.793]  This is scientists trying to put us all in cages.
[00:40:04.913 --> 00:40:06.074]  They want to make us all lab rats.
[00:40:06.394 --> 00:40:11.917]  All the research that has been done into having a soy diet, it's just all negative.
[00:40:12.017 --> 00:40:13.078]  It's all negative.
[00:40:13.118 --> 00:40:21.623]  In fact, there was one study that I was following on this website, Herculean Strength, that's just into fitness and lifting weights and stuff.
[00:40:21.643 --> 00:40:26.786]  And there was a guy who was on a soy-based diet for three months, had all kinds of failures in his organs.
[00:40:27.146 --> 00:40:28.807]  He developed breast tissue.
[00:40:29.167 --> 00:40:30.208]  I mean, just totally unhealthy.
[00:40:30.228 --> 00:40:34.571]  That's why they feed you an all-soy diet basically at prisons, because it takes men and destroys them.
[00:40:34.592 --> 00:40:36.473]  And let's expand on that next hour, Owen.
[00:40:36.633 --> 00:40:40.216]  Well, and then, so what happened was he quit doing it after the three months of experiment.
[00:40:40.376 --> 00:40:45.280]  He went back on a normal diet and basically was able to just get back into health, just back on a normal diet for three months.
[00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:48.043]  And soys and potato chips and everything, but let's be clear.
[00:40:48.783 --> 00:40:52.486]  It was Henry Ford that popularized the soybean for humans.
[00:40:53.066 --> 00:40:56.189]  And if you process soybeans right, it has a very low level of estrogen.
[00:40:56.469 --> 00:41:00.412]  But they're processing basically whole soybeans that you might as well just cut your testicles off.
[00:41:00.672 --> 00:41:03.354]  And women, you might as well just get breast cancer because it makes you grow breast cancer.
[00:41:03.614 --> 00:41:04.215]  That's in the studies.
[00:41:04.455 --> 00:41:05.176]  We're going to go to break.
[00:41:06.172 --> 00:41:09.693]  We got Project Veritas with their bombshell news coming up next hour.
[00:41:09.713 --> 00:41:11.414]  Owen and I are going to cover the waterfront.
[00:41:11.434 --> 00:41:12.354]  We've got so many clips.
[00:41:12.394 --> 00:41:14.235]  We've got Biden at the U.N.
[00:41:14.615 --> 00:41:16.836]  just announcing more world government to sell out of U.S.
[00:41:16.876 --> 00:41:19.497]  sovereignty and how he pledged to inject the whole planet.
[00:41:19.857 --> 00:41:21.998]  That is next hour, but please understand.
[00:41:23.336 --> 00:41:26.937]  We're only able to be on air because of you, and I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:41:27.277 --> 00:41:29.757]  We sell high-quality products that make your life better.

[00:41:46.901 --> 00:41:50.582]  On Monday, we have Ultra 12, the highest quality vitamin B12.

[00:41:57.284 --> 00:42:01.226]  We have X2, the highest quality deep-earth crystal iodine.
[00:42:01.366 --> 00:42:02.866]  So many people are deficient in iodine.
[00:42:03.246 --> 00:42:05.607]  They try to keep it out of your food, keep it out of all your products.
[00:42:05.947 --> 00:42:09.048]  Used to the government until the 70s, put it in the salt, and it made IQs in the U.S.
[00:42:09.068 --> 00:42:12.890]  go up 15 points on average within the first 20 years from putting it in, in the 1930s.
[00:42:14.517 --> 00:42:15.678]  A lot of deformities went down.
[00:42:15.718 --> 00:42:16.679]  There's all sorts of issues.
[00:42:16.699 --> 00:42:17.620]  You need to know about Iodine.
[00:42:17.641 --> 00:42:18.722]  We have the best you're going to find.
[00:42:18.782 --> 00:42:19.783]  Infowarstore.com.

[00:42:20.844 --> 00:42:22.486]  The Power of Deep Earth Crystal Iodine and Elysian.
[00:42:23.167 --> 00:42:25.990]  It's all 50% off at Infowarstore.com.
[00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:30.575]  But the sale on the Winter Sun and the sale on the Ultra 12 will end.
[00:42:31.656 --> 00:42:35.978]  On Monday, it'll go back to like 10% off because we're not going to have more that comes in for months.
[00:42:36.558 --> 00:42:38.939]  Separately, all apparel is at cost.
[00:42:39.179 --> 00:42:41.641]  And I didn't know they hadn't added the baseball caps and stuff.
[00:42:41.661 --> 00:42:44.062]  So now it is all the apparel is at cost.
[00:42:44.102 --> 00:42:45.903]  That means the lowest shirts are $9.95.
[00:42:46.083 --> 00:42:49.784]  The most expensive are $14.95 because some of the stuff costs like $18.
[00:42:50.825 --> 00:42:52.165]  Some of the shirts cost us $5.
[00:42:52.205 --> 00:42:58.129]   So they average it together For the lower cost items are $9.95 and the higher cost items are $14.95.
[00:42:58.329 --> 00:43:00.291]  So it averages together at cost.
[00:43:00.411 --> 00:43:01.411]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:43:01.672 --> 00:43:02.772]  Hundreds of t-shirt designs.
[00:43:03.012 --> 00:43:03.773]  Help wake people up.
[00:43:03.833 --> 00:43:05.114]  Trigger leftists.
[00:43:05.134 --> 00:43:06.635]  You'll meet lots of like-minded people.
[00:43:06.655 --> 00:43:08.196]  Stuff like Arrest Fauci, Arrest Gates.
[00:43:08.756 --> 00:43:12.739]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:14.720]  Baby lives matter.
[00:43:15.361 --> 00:43:16.762]  Biden, the groping shirt.
[00:43:17.402 --> 00:43:18.463]  The Space Force shirts.
[00:43:18.963 --> 00:43:20.004]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:43:19.824 --> 00:43:21.824]  Tom, a lot of them are limited edition.
[00:43:21.824 --> 00:43:24.003]  (beeping)
[00:43:24.003 --> 00:43:31.583]  Thank you guys, let's go, thank you, let's go, thank you.
[00:43:31.583 --> 00:43:35.342]   I am extremely shocked by what's happening at the Texas border.
[00:43:35.374 --> 00:43:37.076]  I mean, I knew that they were breaking the border.
[00:43:37.597 --> 00:43:39.019]  I knew that they hired the same man.
[00:43:40.170 --> 00:43:46.088]   who work for the EU and George Soros, who got hired 10 years ago to break Europe's border
[00:43:46.088 --> 00:43:52.088]   and set up the NGOs that bring people in by land and also by sea on the Zodiac boats,
[00:43:52.088 --> 00:43:57.769]   but also pay them to fly in to European countries and never leave. They are then clients of the
[00:43:57.769 --> 00:44:03.130]   non-governmental organizations of the UN. The longer a refugee is in a new country,
[00:44:03.130 --> 00:44:07.769]   the more likely it is that they'll put down roots and the more likely it is that they will stay.
[00:44:07.986 --> 00:44:11.908]  Understanding open society is one thing.
[00:44:12.108 --> 00:44:19.834]  Trying to create open societies or strengthening open societies is something else.
[00:44:19.854 --> 00:44:27.259]  In order to have an open society, you have to mediate the tension between equality and liberty, popular sovereignty and individual freedom.
[00:44:27.279 --> 00:44:28.420]  It's a difficult task.
[00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:42.204]  And I remember seeing Biden back in March of last year, a full six months before the election, saying that if I get elected, immediately surge the border and come take over the United States.
[00:44:42.884 --> 00:44:47.525]  I would in fact make sure that there is, we immediately surge to the border.
[00:44:47.645 --> 00:44:49.306]  Well, look, I guess I should be flattered.
[00:44:49.946 --> 00:44:51.966]  People are coming because I'm the nice guy.
[00:44:52.026 --> 00:44:53.267]  That's the reason why it's happening.
[00:44:53.847 --> 00:44:56.528]  That I'm a decent man or however it's phrased.
[00:44:56.548 --> 00:44:57.448]  That's why they're coming.
[00:44:57.955 --> 00:45:06.298]  And those who come seeking asylum, we should immediately have the capacity to absorb them, keep them safe until they can be heard.
[00:45:06.518 --> 00:45:09.399]  Well, they came wearing Biden outfits.
[00:45:09.459 --> 00:45:11.739]  They came wearing Biden campaign clothing.
[00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:14.320]  Shirts and jackets and ball caps.
[00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:21.162]  Reports have indicated at least 108 COVID-positive illegal aliens were released by CBP in one fell swoop.
[00:45:21.522 --> 00:45:27.064]  According to reports, at least 185 immigrants released in the past month in Brownsville tested positive.
[00:45:28.399 --> 00:45:31.500]  Where's the vice president on any of this?
[00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:35.820]   But the administration has taken no major steps to prioritize those frontline workers
[00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:37.720]  for the vaccine in the last two months.
[00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:40.599]   Most of them are having to go into the communities to go get the vaccine, even though they're
[00:45:40.599 --> 00:45:45.400]   on the front lines dealing with COVID positive individuals coming across our border.
[00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:47.960]  Where's the vice president on any of this?
[00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:51.080]   Isn't she supposed to be addressing the root causes of migration?
[00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:54.780]   Absolutely, and she has been addressing the root causes of migration by working with
[00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:59.120]   countries in the region to ensure they have the assistance they need to reduce the number
[00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:02.359]   of people who are coming and trying to make those journeys across the border.
[00:46:02.361 --> 00:46:04.702]  We've actually seen some reductions in some of those numbers.
[00:46:05.082 --> 00:46:09.185]  That doesn't change the fact that this is a very challenging situation in Del Rio.
[00:46:09.405 --> 00:46:14.368]  We're working to implement our policies and we're working to ensure we are also addressing root causes.
[00:46:14.588 --> 00:46:26.911]  They don't look like, for example, Christians fleeing persecution from Nigeria, who are actually in the midst of a genocide, who cannot even get asylum in this country, but the asylum laws are actually written for them.
[00:46:27.332 --> 00:46:31.153]  And what you're seeing happen here is, you know those thousands of people in the bridge, Chaka?
[00:46:31.413 --> 00:46:32.553]  You know what the agents tell me?
[00:46:32.933 --> 00:46:35.974]  They've got like 24 Port-A-Johns for those people.
[00:46:36.414 --> 00:46:40.276]  Several hundred of them, like around 300, escaped on Sunday morning.
[00:46:40.296 --> 00:46:41.257]  They just ran away.
[00:46:41.617 --> 00:46:42.878]  The conditions are miserable.
[00:46:43.198 --> 00:46:44.259]  They don't have enough food.
[00:46:44.419 --> 00:46:47.400]  They don't have any real facilities or security.
[00:46:47.741 --> 00:46:50.402]  It is an absolute unmitigated disaster.
[00:46:50.762 --> 00:47:00.668]  And what you're seeing happen here is all those people in the Biden administration that came from the Open Society Foundation that we're not allowed to talk about because that'll be the end of us, right?
[00:47:00.908 --> 00:47:02.029]  They'll come for all of us.
[00:47:02.429 --> 00:47:03.090]  Well, you know what?
[00:47:03.350 --> 00:47:06.213]  Those people, those advisors, they don't want a border.
[00:47:06.513 --> 00:47:08.515]  What does open society mean?
[00:47:08.936 --> 00:47:11.678]  It means no borders, which means no America, right?
[00:47:12.039 --> 00:47:12.519]  No countries.
[00:47:12.559 --> 00:47:18.705]  That's why patriotism and the flag and all of those things are so evil today, right?
[00:47:18.965 --> 00:47:21.528]  They're automatically white supremacy and nationalism.
[00:47:21.868 --> 00:47:24.371]  Never mind that you can be, you know, an African company.
[00:47:24.671 --> 00:47:30.214]  It was tenfold, the Border Patrol said, any previous record surge they saw under Biden.
[00:47:30.074 --> 00:47:33.354]   So what you're seeing is part of a much bigger political picture.
[00:47:33.354 --> 00:47:35.373]  It's not just about the border.
[00:47:35.373 --> 00:47:42.074]   It was tenfold the Border Patrol said any previous record surge they saw under Biden.
[00:47:42.074 --> 00:47:45.173]   Then three months ago, we had an exclusive interview with a Border Patrol agent and we
[00:47:45.173 --> 00:47:47.713]  blurred out his face, his identity.
[00:47:47.713 --> 00:47:55.273]   And he talked about how they are told to turn back nobody basically, but then lie and falsify
[00:47:55.273 --> 00:47:57.793]  and claim that eight out of ten were turnbacks.
[00:47:58.569 --> 00:48:16.643]  So he said they'd already had, as of then, over a million people that they knew had come in, and up to 3 million to 4 million more that had gotten through, and that by the end of fiscal year, they were estimating 8 to 10 million just in the Texas border sector.
[00:48:19.042 --> 00:48:20.883]  Well, I really like Laura Logan.
[00:48:20.923 --> 00:48:21.744]  I've always liked her.
[00:48:21.944 --> 00:48:23.545]  She's a real investigative journalist.
[00:48:23.565 --> 00:48:26.668]  She got raped by like 20 plus Egyptians.
[00:48:26.688 --> 00:48:28.309]  It took her a long time to get over that.
[00:48:28.749 --> 00:48:41.900]  During the Arab Spring that Tucker Carlson was exposing at the time, but that CNN and other channels were pushing as a good thing, people like, of course, their big star over there, Anderson Cooper.
[00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:46.003]  That was all part of Obama destabilizing the world, being behind radical Islam.
[00:48:46.023 --> 00:48:56.831]  That's why the collapse of Afghanistan, the bad pullout violating Trump's plan, was executed as well, because they want to empower these groups to invade Europe, just like they're empowering groups to invade the United States.
[00:48:56.851 --> 00:49:07.199]  But wow, she was on last night with Tucker Carlson, and they crossed that invisible line that you're not supposed to cross.
[00:49:07.759 --> 00:49:14.598]   Remember Lou Dobbs had, two years ago now, He had judicial watches head-on.
[00:49:16.295 --> 00:49:31.702]  And he was covering the fact that the Open Society gets State Department money, that Trump had just killed that money, and that's given to George Soros to then invade with UN NGOs that set up these refugee camps in Guatemala and in other areas on the border of Europe.
[00:49:32.382 --> 00:49:33.263]  Which is all a fact!
[00:49:33.583 --> 00:49:41.726]  I mean, separately, George Soros is in Newsweek and Reuters bragging how he does it, but you're not supposed to criticize it and say, cut the funding, which Trump had just done.
[00:49:42.147 --> 00:49:48.398]   They said you can never have that particular person on from Judicial Watch.
[00:49:48.398 --> 00:49:50.639]  And they threatened to fire Dobbs if he did it again.
[00:49:50.639 --> 00:49:55.480]   Well, last night, and it's in a report that John Bowne filed on the subject today at Band
[00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:58.318]  Op Video, it actually happened.
[00:49:58.318 --> 00:50:05.998]   So that shows you Tucker Carlson is the only person that is at Fox News that actually has
[00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:07.610]  I can tell you that.
[00:50:08.111 --> 00:50:08.811]  And I'll leave it at that.
[00:50:08.831 --> 00:50:16.118]  But the article in the video is called Invasion by NGOs to the John Bowne section of Band.Video.
[00:50:16.158 --> 00:50:19.021]  I hope you will share that information.
[00:50:19.061 --> 00:50:22.644]  I was on Tim Pool's great podcast last night.
[00:50:23.732 --> 00:50:25.133]  That is Farmhouse Compound.
[00:50:26.054 --> 00:50:28.816]  And they were trying to tweet out ban.video, and they wouldn't let them.
[00:50:28.836 --> 00:50:32.619]  And I said, no, you got to tweet out freeworldnews.tv, and they did that.
[00:50:33.379 --> 00:50:35.060]  But that's why we have freeworldnews.tv.
[00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:36.021]  It's the same as ban.video.
[00:50:36.061 --> 00:50:37.662]  It's the same site, the same links, the same videos.
[00:50:37.983 --> 00:50:38.883]  It just gets you around that.
[00:50:38.903 --> 00:50:39.744]  And I'm sure they'll ban that.
[00:50:39.764 --> 00:50:41.445]  It's been up for six months.
[00:50:41.685 --> 00:50:42.826]  They haven't banned that URL yet.
[00:50:43.326 --> 00:50:48.130]  Remember 79 Days of News and all those other names we had that they did, didn't ban.
[00:50:48.250 --> 00:50:50.532]  But we can just create a new one as soon as they do that.
[00:50:50.552 --> 00:50:51.432]  But it's good for now.
[00:50:52.253 --> 00:50:53.374]  FreeWorldNews.tv.
[00:50:53.414 --> 00:51:02.963]  But think as Americans, we've got to fight to get out transmissions and fight to show you what's happening at the border with our crew that went down there last week, did a great job and broke a lot of this news first.
[00:51:03.364 --> 00:51:05.265]  But then the Taliban, they've got their Twitter.
[00:51:05.285 --> 00:51:09.750]  And I say as long as they don't call for violence, coordinate attacks on Twitter, that's their issue.
[00:51:09.810 --> 00:51:12.612]  But I mean, I say we should have free speech for everybody.
[00:51:13.453 --> 00:51:23.606]  We don't get the free speech, Ellen, which shows, because we're the bad guys, we're the dirty Americans, and that's why Sarah Silverman and people say they get sick at their stomach, they get scared when they see American flags.
[00:51:23.646 --> 00:51:25.608]  Well then, what ideology does she follow?
[00:51:25.649 --> 00:51:26.670]  Well, corporate globalism.
[00:51:26.930 --> 00:51:31.296]  The same Apple-owned type system that runs the worst slave camps in the world with suicide nets.
[00:51:32.652 --> 00:51:40.057]  And the other day, Sarah Silverman called for what has been dubbed a national divorce on her podcast.
[00:51:40.418 --> 00:51:43.680]  Yeah, there's the clip right there saying, look, you know, Americans don't get along.
[00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:50.605]  And so, Alex, this is not what, I mean, this was never anything that I ever wanted to see happen, a national divorce or whatever you want to call it.
[00:51:50.625 --> 00:51:52.626]  That's what Black Lives Matter was, a racial divide.
[00:51:52.686 --> 00:51:56.109]  Now the vaccine is about the ignorant and germaphobe divide.
[00:51:56.129 --> 00:51:57.710]  And this is divide and conquer.
[00:51:57.730 --> 00:51:58.310]  It's in the country.
[00:51:58.330 --> 00:51:58.891]  That's what they're trying.
[00:51:59.572 --> 00:52:02.910]  And so, but now you look at a situation and you say, if it's inevitable...
[00:52:03.792 --> 00:52:05.973]  As Biden announced today that the U.S.
[00:52:06.033 --> 00:52:17.900]  is going to surrender to the New World Order and to the U.N., well then do Republican states or do certain states of the Union even have a choice if they want to have a sovereign living situation at all?
[00:52:18.261 --> 00:52:19.001]  I mean, what do you do?
[00:52:19.041 --> 00:52:24.104]  I mean, you can go, I remember history class, you'd study maps in Civil War and you'd have the free states and the slave states.
[00:52:24.364 --> 00:52:25.745]  I mean, is that what we're coming back to?
[00:52:25.805 --> 00:52:30.328]  Do we have to have a map of America where you have free states and you have slave states?
[00:52:30.908 --> 00:52:33.634]  Well, a lot of people that are living in the country are self-sufficient.
[00:52:34.451 --> 00:52:42.232]  From West Virginia to Texas to Idaho to Montana to Wyoming are saying, well, we'll just have our own food, our own community.
[00:52:42.252 --> 00:52:43.373]  They're going to cut the fuel off.
[00:52:43.813 --> 00:52:45.673]  They're going to cut the electricity off down the road.
[00:52:46.453 --> 00:52:48.453]  And they are going to bring us under feudalism.
[00:52:48.493 --> 00:52:49.814]  We have to defeat them.
[00:52:50.194 --> 00:52:58.635]  We can't go along with this idea they're pushing because they control the big central banks that are going to break this country up.
[00:52:58.655 --> 00:53:05.520]   So speaking of that, here's Sarah Silverman saying that she gets really upset Uh, in a piece she was in a so-called comedy.
[00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:06.281]  It's totally boring.
[00:53:06.301 --> 00:53:08.423]  People all get incredibly low ratings, by the way.
[00:53:08.443 --> 00:53:11.147]  Not just in the viewers, but also people rate it.
[00:53:11.207 --> 00:53:13.610]  It's like half a star, but they still just prop her up.
[00:53:13.991 --> 00:53:17.595]  And then they have the clip of her on the podcast again saying, let's have a national divorce.
[00:53:17.615 --> 00:53:19.378]  Well, listen, you already had your divorce.
[00:53:19.778 --> 00:53:21.661]  You work for the globalists, you're a parasite.
[00:53:21.942 --> 00:53:23.464]  You work for Hollywood, it's parasitic.
[00:53:23.865 --> 00:53:26.389]  And so, you're trying to say you want a divorce from us?
[00:53:26.429 --> 00:53:27.390]  That's reverse psychology.
[00:53:27.631 --> 00:53:32.859]  They want to stay glommed on to us, running our lives, making our children wear masks, and injecting deadly poison in them.
[00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:34.302]  She's part of a cult, here she is.
[00:53:35.925 --> 00:53:37.606]  I had a boyfriend many years ago.
[00:53:38.186 --> 00:53:40.327]  He was my first boyfriend who had his own house.
[00:53:40.927 --> 00:53:48.070]  And one day I went outside to see what he was doing, and he was hoisting an American flag up the flagpole in his front yard.
[00:53:48.611 --> 00:53:51.132]  And I instantly felt very weird.
[00:53:52.012 --> 00:53:56.494]  It didn't make sense, but I felt this feeling of like, um, I felt scared.
[00:53:56.854 --> 00:53:58.215]  Yeah, I felt scared.
[00:53:58.875 --> 00:54:00.896]  And so I was like, what are you doing?
[00:54:01.396 --> 00:54:11.582]   And he said, Raising the flag and I was like why and he's like, um, because I love America and I was like right
[00:54:12.492 --> 00:54:13.332]  Right, of course.
[00:54:14.253 --> 00:54:16.154]  But inside, I was shaken.
[00:54:16.654 --> 00:54:22.938]  And then I calmly walked to my car and I got inside and I called my sister Susie to tell her what happened.
[00:54:23.338 --> 00:54:25.899]  Now maybe you're thinking, what do you mean what happened?
[00:54:25.959 --> 00:54:26.620]  Nothing happened.
[00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:29.321]  Your boyfriend put an American flag up at his own house.
[00:54:29.861 --> 00:54:31.062]  No, you're totally right.
[00:54:31.142 --> 00:54:33.443]  I had no idea why I was freaking out.
[00:54:33.843 --> 00:54:36.245]  I just, I had this very visceral reaction.
[00:54:37.125 --> 00:54:45.976]  And my sister, who knows shit because she's a rabbi in Israel, explained to me, she was like, dude, nationalism is innately terrifying for Jews.
[00:54:46.176 --> 00:54:46.937]  Think about it.
[00:54:47.297 --> 00:54:49.680]  Flags, marching, blind allegiance.
[00:54:50.100 --> 00:54:52.463]  These things tend to ring a bell for us.
[00:54:53.204 --> 00:54:53.585]  Right.
[00:54:53.885 --> 00:54:54.406]  Of course.
[00:54:54.546 --> 00:54:54.906]  Duh.
[00:54:55.507 --> 00:54:56.248]  It made sense.
[00:54:57.620 --> 00:54:58.901]  That makes no sense.
[00:54:59.221 --> 00:55:01.602]  And then she's the one that dresses up like Hitler to get attention on TV.
[00:55:01.722 --> 00:55:03.402]  So let's expand on this.
[00:55:04.223 --> 00:55:05.763]  America saved the Jews.
[00:55:06.403 --> 00:55:09.205]  So now what she's saying is America is the Nazi.
[00:55:09.585 --> 00:55:11.325]  The left says the flag is racist.
[00:55:11.625 --> 00:55:20.589]  The National Archives puts a trigger warning on the Bill of Rights and Constitution because she's an authoritarian that represents people that run Chinese slave camps, big corporations that wrap themselves in Black Lives Matter.
[00:55:20.889 --> 00:55:25.929]   And her talking point is to introduce that, "Oh, I hate America, it's dirty, it's bad."
[00:55:25.929 --> 00:55:32.210]   And then my sister, who's a rabbi, she explained to me, "You're right, because you're a poor victim of America."
[00:55:32.210 --> 00:55:33.250]  This is out of control.
[00:55:33.250 --> 00:55:37.048]   But again, this is the talking point she's been given because the globalists are getting rid
[00:55:37.048 --> 00:55:38.210]  of this country, folks.
[00:55:38.210 --> 00:55:42.010]  How does she say that, I'm just at a loss here.
[00:55:42.119 --> 00:55:45.958]   Israel is one of the most nationalistic countries on the planet.
[00:55:45.958 --> 00:55:50.038]   Well, the truth is, this is where pure libertarians don't get it.
[00:55:50.038 --> 00:55:54.599]   If you don't have a defense system and your own culture and your own ideas, you will be
[00:55:54.599 --> 00:55:57.878]   conquered because the other groups, they're always bad groups out there.
[00:55:57.878 --> 00:56:01.678]   And so she's saying you shouldn't have a nation, you shouldn't have an identity, you shouldn't
[00:56:01.678 --> 00:56:05.939]   be proud to be American because she's part of the globalist corporate sellout that wants
[00:56:05.939 --> 00:56:08.559]   to tell us to have no identity, so we just roll over to them.
[00:56:08.559 --> 00:56:09.559]  It's very elementary.
[00:56:09.559 --> 00:56:14.399]   If she's a globalist, she has her talking points and she's up there to tell you America
[00:56:14.399 --> 00:56:15.399]  equals Hitler.
[00:56:15.399 --> 00:56:16.399]  If Israel is a globalist, it's a globalist.
[00:56:16.481 --> 00:56:27.585]  If that story is even true that she's talking about, this is the same woman who is such a basket case that she saw painting on the street that marks plumbing or electrical wire.
[00:56:27.605 --> 00:56:30.387]  You have to have it done whenever you're going to do work in your yard or out on the street.
[00:56:30.647 --> 00:56:34.929]  She saw a painting on the street and said, oh my gosh, look, it's a Nazi swastika!
[00:56:35.189 --> 00:56:37.770]  And it was literally just a marking for pipes under the street.
[00:56:38.652 --> 00:56:40.973]  And this woman says she's triggered by the elected left?
[00:56:41.033 --> 00:56:42.154]  She knows that's not true.
[00:56:42.874 --> 00:56:44.115]  So does AOC when they do this.
[00:56:44.135 --> 00:56:47.077]  She said cauliflower is bad because it's white.
[00:56:47.177 --> 00:56:47.677]  AOC did.
[00:56:48.077 --> 00:56:51.299]  That is to manipulate their lowbrow supporters to really get scared.
[00:56:51.839 --> 00:56:55.861]  And so Bubba Wallace sees the loop that everybody has.
[00:56:56.402 --> 00:56:57.903]  If they're smart you tie one on your garage.
[00:56:58.763 --> 00:57:21.131]  So you pull it down, because it was an electric garage, and he goes, I saw, you know, I saw these, these nuisances, but that's because this is the new culture and the new system of the corporations turn us against each other while they spy on us, while they lock us down, they put deadly poison in all of us, while they open our borders, while they tell us we're not essential, while they do all this to us, then they run around saying, did you see the cloud?
[00:57:21.371 --> 00:57:22.592]  There was a swastika in the cloud.
[00:57:24.228 --> 00:57:25.128]  It's complete lunacy.
[00:57:25.168 --> 00:57:25.909]  It's clown world.
[00:57:25.989 --> 00:57:27.729]  It's a mental illness is what it is.
[00:57:28.089 --> 00:57:29.190]  And I see all these videos.
[00:57:29.210 --> 00:57:30.110]  They're young kids.
[00:57:30.910 --> 00:57:32.631]  I covered one where they're saying, I don't understand.
[00:57:32.671 --> 00:57:33.931]  I'm walking around.
[00:57:33.991 --> 00:57:34.872]  I'm triggered by everything.
[00:57:34.912 --> 00:57:35.652]  I'm always nervous.
[00:57:35.692 --> 00:57:36.412]  I'm always afraid.
[00:57:36.772 --> 00:57:38.293]  That's what the left has done to you.
[00:57:39.173 --> 00:57:40.134]  That's what they've done to you!
[00:57:40.154 --> 00:57:41.115]  Six to nine times.
[00:57:41.135 --> 00:57:43.057]  It's an official basket case!
[00:57:43.417 --> 00:57:46.460]  Six to nine times more likely to commit suicide than to put a mental institution on the left.
[00:57:46.801 --> 00:57:47.361]  But let's come back.
[00:57:47.401 --> 00:57:51.706]  That was Silverman a while back ago, saying, oh, I just started hating America, it's healthy.
[00:57:52.006 --> 00:57:54.408]  Now she came out and said, screw America, get rid of it, it's bad.
[00:57:54.689 --> 00:57:55.790]  We'll show you that clip when we come back.
[00:57:55.810 --> 00:57:57.391]  These people are enemies of America, folks.
[00:57:57.832 --> 00:57:58.472]  Welcome back!
[00:57:58.532 --> 00:58:06.974]   You know, I'm sick of looking at Sarah Silverman, that little anti-American Globalist rat, shycom, dropping.
[00:58:06.994 --> 00:58:08.615]  We're not going to play the clip of her.
[00:58:08.635 --> 00:58:09.715]  Everybody knows she said it.
[00:58:10.315 --> 00:58:21.560]  How about we play Biden calling for a new world order and then defining it as China owning and dominating us as Milley has said to our troops that America's going to go down and China's going to go up and that's the way it is.
[00:58:22.100 --> 00:58:25.281]  He also says white people attack the Capitol because they're inherently racist.
[00:58:25.921 --> 00:58:29.543]  Total globalists divide the country, take the country down, crap.
[00:58:30.312 --> 00:58:32.312]  Whether we put up with it, we deserve what we get.
[00:58:32.312 --> 00:58:34.312]  I mean, it's just wall-to-wall propaganda, by the way.
[00:58:34.312 --> 00:58:39.312]   I'll hit next segment with Owen, and then James O'Keefe's coming up at the end, last segment of this hour.
[00:58:39.312 --> 00:58:44.312]   Wall-to-wall in newspapers. Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Washington Post.
[00:58:44.312 --> 00:58:49.312]   I hardly ever actually read the physical papers, but flying back this morning, got some at the airport.
[00:58:49.312 --> 00:58:55.312]   And every page, I mean, just every section, local, national, is, "Oh, it's totally safe. Everyone loves it.
[00:58:55.312 --> 00:58:57.312]  No one's gotten sick. No one's had a problem."
[00:58:57.764 --> 00:59:04.589]  And then they have a separate article, I haven't gotten to this on Infowars.com, that Tucker Carlson covered, where they have a Church of Satan thing.
[00:59:05.890 --> 00:59:11.395]  Well, the Satanists are helping save us from COVID, and how the evil Christians have lied.
[00:59:11.415 --> 00:59:13.416]  I'm not joking.
[00:59:13.997 --> 00:59:16.699]  And they have said that the vaccines have killed thousands.
[00:59:17.039 --> 00:59:19.321]  So we're gonna see who's telling the truth, the Church of Satan?
[00:59:20.221 --> 00:59:25.340]   the Satan lie or the actual VAERS reporting which is much worse than that next segment.
[00:59:25.340 --> 00:59:31.739]   But Owen, let's get to this clip. You've seen the Biden thing. I haven't seen it yet. I've
[00:59:31.739 --> 00:59:35.739]   seen the transcripts. It's global government, carbon tax, all that. But let's hear from him
[00:59:35.739 --> 00:59:40.701]   recently and also a few years ago about where he actually stands. Here it is.
[00:59:40.701 --> 00:59:47.820]   We, and particularly you, your class, has an incredible window of opportunity
[00:59:48.701 --> 00:59:58.012]   to lead in shaping a new world order for the 21st As much as anybody in this room, including if you're Henry Kissinger, who I love.
[00:59:57.852 --> 01:00:04.852]  of task we have now is to actually create a new world order.
[01:00:04.852 --> 01:00:13.652]   I do know a lot about foreign policy. As much as anybody in this room, including if you're
[01:00:13.652 --> 01:00:20.652]   Henry Kissinger, who I love. Folks, we have mortgaged our foreign policy. Everyone's out
[01:00:20.652 --> 01:00:27.292]   there going, "Oh my God, how in God's name? You know, the Chinese came here and the President
[01:00:27.292 --> 01:00:28.012]  get anything.
[01:00:28.499 --> 01:00:29.100]  Guess what?
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:29.921]  They own us.
[01:00:33.444 --> 01:00:34.805]  And the full clip, they clap.
[01:00:34.825 --> 01:00:37.368]  That's to the Council on Foreign Relations who've all invested.
[01:00:37.728 --> 01:00:42.632]  They're the middlemen who get as much as all the Chinese people get in less than 100 families.
[01:00:42.993 --> 01:00:43.773]  That's what Trump said.
[01:00:43.894 --> 01:00:45.995]  I thought the Chinese were bad and Xi Jinping was bad.
[01:00:46.436 --> 01:00:47.137]  I met with him.
[01:00:48.522 --> 01:00:52.706]  Our middlemen get more than the whole Chinese population, so I'm going to fix it with Xi Jinping.
[01:00:53.107 --> 01:00:56.811]  And then when they got rid of Trump and stole the election, they even admitted it in the Wall Street Journal.
[01:00:56.831 --> 01:00:57.451]  I couldn't believe it.
[01:00:57.471 --> 01:00:58.192]  I already knew this.
[01:00:58.212 --> 01:01:00.815]  The Wall Street Journal this weekend.
[01:01:00.835 --> 01:01:01.596]  We'll cover it coming up.
[01:01:02.554 --> 01:01:11.599]  They even say right there that that's when Xi Jinping started kicking all the big tech out and taking it over because he saw they were more powerful than even the American president.
[01:01:11.879 --> 01:01:21.624]  So see how the globalists thought taking out Trump would help them take over the world, but now it's turned their own commies against them because they see that big tech actually thinks it's in charge.
[01:01:21.864 --> 01:01:23.725]  See, these leftists don't think long-term.
[01:01:23.905 --> 01:01:24.805]  They don't think strategically.
[01:01:24.825 --> 01:01:25.886]  They don't understand real power.
[01:01:26.306 --> 01:01:32.623]  Well, think about what Joe Biden just admitted in those clips, aside from the New World Order, but in the China clip specifically.
[01:01:34.235 --> 01:01:37.477]  A lot of people probably get into government or media with good intentions.
[01:01:37.537 --> 01:01:39.337]  Who knows if that was Biden or not.
[01:01:39.358 --> 01:01:45.300]  But the point is, they see, as Biden said, that we've completely mortgaged the future of this country to the Chinese communists.
[01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:51.003]  Whether it's our manufacturing, or industry, or our culture, our entertainment.
[01:01:51.343 --> 01:01:52.604]  China just runs it all now.
[01:01:53.004 --> 01:01:58.527]  And so Biden just admits it, and I guess he just figures, well, screw America, go China!
[01:01:59.227 --> 01:02:00.528]  And so that's the problem here.
[01:02:00.728 --> 01:02:09.632]  People realize this is going on, and then they just figure, well, I'm not gonna fight it, I'm not gonna stand up, I'm not gonna speak the truth, I'll just ally with China, and I'll line my pockets, and I'll be rich and powerful, screw the dirt.
[01:02:09.672 --> 01:02:25.419]   And they're a little concerned that Americans might get together and vote this out, so they put in election fraud, and then they have all the entertainers tell us You know America's Hitler, and America's mean to Jews, and we need the big megabanks and Klaus Schwab, who's actually the grandson of the top Nazi, to run everything and take over.
[01:02:25.479 --> 01:02:28.701]  And George Soros, who for the best time of his life was rounding up fellow Jews.
[01:02:29.101 --> 01:02:30.361]  I mean, it's just Twilight Zone.
[01:02:30.621 --> 01:02:35.844]  But that's all they've got is, it's all racist, it's evil, down with America, while they loot the living snot out of us.
[01:02:36.084 --> 01:02:37.704]  See, they sold us out already.
[01:02:37.865 --> 01:02:39.065]  He said we're mortgaged to China.
[01:02:39.845 --> 01:02:41.166]  So we're already sold out to them.
[01:02:41.426 --> 01:02:43.547]  And then he's telling, well, hey, you didn't know we sold you out?
[01:02:43.807 --> 01:02:45.448]  How about we just lock your ass up in prison?
[01:02:45.988 --> 01:02:59.975]  It's beyond Stockholm Syndrome, too, at this point, Alex, where it used to be that the left would, well, yeah, maybe they'd engage in some intellectual debate, maybe they'd engage in some conversation about this, but now it's, no, we want Satanism.
[01:03:00.055 --> 01:03:03.296]  Satanism is a loophole for us to kill babies with a heart.
[01:03:03.717 --> 01:03:06.778]  Satanism is our answer to force people to get vaccines.
[01:03:07.338 --> 01:03:12.221]  And then the Army's showing official PowerPoints to thousands of troops about the Satanists are going to help you.
[01:03:13.041 --> 01:03:14.121]  Where does that go?
[01:03:14.181 --> 01:03:16.142]  I mean, where are they going intellectually?
[01:03:16.182 --> 01:03:17.902]  Where are they going spiritually?
[01:03:17.942 --> 01:03:19.183]  Where are they going culturally?
[01:03:19.223 --> 01:03:20.003]  They're telling us!
[01:03:20.323 --> 01:03:21.824]  They're going complete evil!
[01:03:22.324 --> 01:03:24.804]  And it's driven by hatred, is what it is.
[01:03:25.205 --> 01:03:41.945]   They hate us so much, or they hate America so much, or they hate Trump so much, that was probably the biggest wave of the hatred for Trump, that they'll just go anything, as long as the media, or their politicians that they, I guess, worship now, It's whatever it is against Trump or whatever it is against America or whatever.
[01:03:41.965 --> 01:03:47.807]  Well, yeah, that's how they got, you know, Penn and Teller, Penn Jillette to endorse Governor Newsom.
[01:03:48.187 --> 01:03:51.168]  He claims he's a libertarian and he just endorsed a guy that's an authoritarian.
[01:03:51.969 --> 01:03:56.510]  And now California is going to be going under even more stricter mandates.
[01:03:56.710 --> 01:03:58.571]  And you'll have a mass exodus from California.
[01:03:58.891 --> 01:04:00.172]  And it's funny because the Democrats admit it.
[01:04:00.192 --> 01:04:02.154]  They're like, yeah, everyone's leaving California.
[01:04:02.174 --> 01:04:04.096]  It sucks here because of our policy.
[01:04:04.156 --> 01:04:07.099]  So go to Texas and destroy Texas, too.
[01:04:07.140 --> 01:04:10.022]  And then when you're done there, go to Florida and destroy Florida, too.
[01:04:10.243 --> 01:04:11.864]  And then we'll destroy everything.
[01:04:12.105 --> 01:04:14.727]  And you Americans won't have any states to go to anymore.
[01:04:14.867 --> 01:04:15.929]  You'll have no culture.
[01:04:16.069 --> 01:04:17.030]  You'll have no freedom.
[01:04:17.050 --> 01:04:19.652]  Well, that's the thing about leftists is they destroy.
[01:04:19.672 --> 01:04:20.693]  They do the same thing.
[01:04:21.454 --> 01:04:29.122]  I've had them come up and say you shouldn't drive a big truck and tell, when I was still married to my ex-wife, you know, you shouldn't have three kids at Whole Foods.
[01:04:29.403 --> 01:04:31.725]  I mean, they literally hiss at families.
[01:04:32.306 --> 01:04:33.327]  They literally are demons.
[01:04:33.927 --> 01:04:34.708]  And here's the crazy thing.
[01:04:34.768 --> 01:04:40.615]  I saw those stack of newspapers, and you might not recognize this just because you're not seeing what the kids are seeing as much as I am.
[01:04:41.135 --> 01:04:43.396]  There was an individual, this individual Lil Nas.
[01:04:43.816 --> 01:04:46.598]  He does videos worshiping, sodomizing Satan.
[01:04:47.038 --> 01:04:49.719]  He does videos where he's a man pretending to get pregnant.
[01:04:49.819 --> 01:04:51.440]  Totally sold out to the New World Order.
[01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:52.341]  A talentless hack!
[01:04:52.621 --> 01:04:58.224]  But, you know, anybody in the entertainment industry, the music industry, they can make anybody successful they want.
[01:04:58.664 --> 01:05:03.606]  That's why they put Nicki Minaj on the shelf and gave you Cardi B, because they choose who's going to be successful.
[01:05:03.846 --> 01:05:08.809]  And I saw there's this huge cover story about Lil Nas X in one of these papers.
[01:05:09.369 --> 01:05:09.669]  Why?
[01:05:09.929 --> 01:05:10.890]  Because he's sold out!
[01:05:11.130 --> 01:05:12.731]  He tells you he's a pregnant male!
[01:05:13.051 --> 01:05:19.615]  No, I saw that every- I could do a whole show just on what's in newspapers, because it's the most condensed- I was in the restaurant at the hotel in D.C.
[01:05:20.055 --> 01:05:21.636]  All three TVs, I shot video of it.
[01:05:22.580 --> 01:05:32.425]  All three of the TVs had, it's safe for children, shots for children, the shots are 100% effective, just all lying, just bombarding every channel, so they're getting desperate.
[01:05:32.565 --> 01:05:41.849]  I saw the exact same thing on all the national, as you were showing it on the local news, I saw the exact same thing on a national news level, and I think the reason why they do that in the paper... Oh, you saw the video I sent you?
[01:05:41.989 --> 01:05:49.853]  Yeah, yeah, we played it on the air yesterday, and I just, I was just saying I saw it on national TV all morning, but I think the reason why they do that in the newspapers is the same reason why they do it on The View.
[01:05:51.044 --> 01:06:06.672]  It's just conditioning, not to be insensitive here, but older people that are still in the newspaper medium, or still in the daytime TV medium, to just convince you, you lost, America's lost, this is the new culture, this is what people want, so just give up and give in, when that's not even the case!
[01:06:06.932 --> 01:06:08.953]  The view is, nobody watches The View!
[01:06:09.173 --> 01:06:12.355]  It's full of illogical, unintellectual fops!
[01:06:14.235 --> 01:06:15.896]  All right, we're going to come right back with Biden.
[01:06:16.016 --> 01:06:22.518]  I wanted you to see him earlier declaring that he worships China, that China owns us, we're slaves.
[01:06:22.538 --> 01:06:24.879]  I mean, no wonder Milley says China's our boss.
[01:06:24.899 --> 01:06:27.220]  They're going to take over because that's the official sellout.
[01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:29.701]  And so now you know why they stole your election.
[01:06:29.741 --> 01:06:31.102]  Now you know why they won a race war.
[01:06:31.402 --> 01:06:32.102]  These are enemies.
[01:06:32.142 --> 01:06:33.163]  These are our conquerors.
[01:06:33.643 --> 01:06:38.665]  So I just played you HBO and Netflix force fed comedian they put on every channel.
[01:06:40.323 --> 01:06:46.162]   saying America is Hitler and Nazi and the American flag is Hitler and Nazi and we should get rid of America.
[01:06:46.162 --> 01:06:49.922]   Then I showed you Biden saying we're owned by China, we're mortgaged to China,
[01:06:49.922 --> 01:06:53.363]   and they run us now. I can play Millie from last week saying it
[01:06:53.363 --> 01:06:54.842]  to the troops.
[01:06:54.842 --> 01:06:58.693]   He doesn't just say it in a phone call and then lie and say our president tried to overthrow the
[01:06:58.693 --> 01:07:02.123]   government on January 6th, but don't worry, I've got the nukes, I'm the boss.
[01:07:02.202 --> 01:07:10.830]  I mean, it's, and of course Xi Jinping pulled back and kicked the globalists out and said, I'm cutting your corporations off, you're going to do this to me, to us.
[01:07:11.370 --> 01:07:17.415]  I mean, because you think the Chai Koms want to work with the globalists after they sold out our own country?
[01:07:17.736 --> 01:07:20.058]  The Chai Koms are like, you ran the world, you had all the power.
[01:07:20.378 --> 01:07:21.099]  Why'd you do that?
[01:07:21.179 --> 01:07:23.221]  Because the globalists are satanic.
[01:07:23.621 --> 01:07:25.442]  They hate the Christian power of America.
[01:07:25.462 --> 01:07:26.382]  They wanted to corrupt us.
[01:07:26.722 --> 01:07:27.403]  It's spiritual.
[01:07:27.703 --> 01:07:31.425]  Well, the Chi-Coms are already soulless, so they're exporting all that.
[01:07:31.485 --> 01:07:35.507]  They're owning Hollywood on record now, four of the six houses.
[01:07:35.787 --> 01:07:41.229]  They're having the left give us the cultural poison, but they don't allow it on their airwaves, folks.
[01:07:41.809 --> 01:07:44.571]  So remember that when you see what's happening.
[01:07:44.611 --> 01:07:46.912]  This is war, and America's pretty much conquered.
[01:07:47.452 --> 01:08:06.542]  The private Federal Reserve, the stolen election, now they want to mop up the states, now they want to mop up the systems, and they're now flushing out all their blue cities, as you said earlier, to come invade us and take over with all the decadent slobs they've created, who are then going to find out when everything implodes that they're going to be in forced work brigades.
[01:08:06.862 --> 01:08:14.246]  You know, if they succeed in their takeover, Owen, can you imagine what it's going to be like to all these leftists who thought they were going to have leadership positions in the Communist takeover?
[01:08:14.266 --> 01:08:15.827]  They're going to literally be in a forced labor camp?
[01:08:16.067 --> 01:08:23.911]  Or that have just enjoyed the American lifestyle with the ease of access and just the excess and the access.
[01:08:23.971 --> 01:08:25.172]  It's all going to go to the wayside.
[01:08:25.192 --> 01:08:33.236]  And I think what's happening right now, Alex, and it might not even matter at this point if Texas secures the southern border and the Biden administration may even help them and allow it.
[01:08:33.256 --> 01:08:36.198]  They've already got eight to ten million in here illegally in the last year or so.
[01:08:36.278 --> 01:08:37.458]  So it may not even matter.
[01:08:37.478 --> 01:08:38.579]  But what they're doing now.
[01:08:41.136 --> 01:08:46.658]  Newsom just signed the bill in California basically saying that the government can build housing projects anywhere they want.
[01:08:47.178 --> 01:08:53.661]  So in California, they've created such a bad state for Americans to live in that all the Americans are leaving.
[01:08:53.701 --> 01:08:57.742]  Oh, it's a giant third world colony invasion point, which is the official UN plan.
[01:08:58.082 --> 01:09:07.246]  And they're also going to build giant housing areas in Northern California in the middle of rural areas to then import those groups that they then give welfare to that is then paid out to the Democrat NGOs.
[01:09:07.406 --> 01:09:18.117]  So now the Democrat voting locusts are being moved to Texas and Montana and Idaho and Florida, traditionally red states, so they can flip them blue because, you know, they're not very smart.
[01:09:18.157 --> 01:09:20.460]  They're just going to import that policy and destroy other states.
[01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:22.042]  And by the way, that was Obama's last deal.
[01:09:22.062 --> 01:09:26.446]  He signed an executive order when he left to get rid of single-dwelling homes, family homes.
[01:09:26.466 --> 01:09:27.087]  They don't want those.
[01:09:27.347 --> 01:09:36.154]  So now they're going to import their millions of illegal immigrants into the suburbs of California and they won't lose California because they'll amnesty all of them.
[01:09:36.415 --> 01:09:39.958]  So they'll be voting Democrat whether they do or not is irrelevant.
[01:09:40.018 --> 01:09:41.299]  The Democrats will just vote for them.
[01:09:41.859 --> 01:09:43.140]  And so they'll ballot harvest.
[01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:45.883]  They'll put all the illegals on welfare and then milk part of that off.
[01:09:46.243 --> 01:09:47.904]  And so that's the plan for California.
[01:09:48.125 --> 01:09:51.167]  Exodus of all the American people after they destroyed the economy.
[01:09:51.547 --> 01:09:55.711]  And then and then send all those Democrat locusts to the red states to flip those states.
[01:09:55.851 --> 01:10:03.074]  And while the globalists use the trillions in fiat currency that we've got to pay back with taxes as Biden expands the IRS, the biggest it's ever been.
[01:10:03.414 --> 01:10:05.936]  So he says working class, middle class, you're all going to be taxed.
[01:10:06.216 --> 01:10:07.816]  The billionaires are all tax exempt.
[01:10:07.896 --> 01:10:11.278]  They're going to tax all the middle class and poor people to pay for the illegal aliens.
[01:10:11.338 --> 01:10:13.439]  I mean, this is an admitted military takeover.
[01:10:13.479 --> 01:10:21.105]  And they want to be in your bank account because they're well aware that you may have assets or a cryptocurrency and they want to know.
[01:10:21.165 --> 01:10:21.725]  They want to know.
[01:10:21.825 --> 01:10:23.426]  Or you may sell the old tractor.
[01:10:23.486 --> 01:10:25.648]  You may get some cash and they want to know about it.
[01:10:25.668 --> 01:10:26.228]  They got to know.
[01:10:26.268 --> 01:10:27.670]  The government's got to get their cut.
[01:10:27.710 --> 01:10:30.992]  The Democrats vote for all of it as they stand against big government, so they say.
[01:10:31.933 --> 01:10:46.779]   But, you know, this is why the national divorce is taking such a serious topic of debate right now, Alex, because at what point Do Texas and Florida or Missouri or some of these other conservative states say, look,
[01:10:47.697 --> 01:10:49.858]  We've seen what you've done to your states.
[01:10:49.878 --> 01:10:51.659]  We're not going to let you do it here.
[01:10:51.679 --> 01:10:52.860]  You're right.
[01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:57.642]  This is a formula to conquer America using third world populations that's in all the UN documents.
[01:10:57.722 --> 01:11:01.764]  And speaking of that, I want to get to the Biden clip.
[01:11:01.784 --> 01:11:02.364]  We're out of time.
[01:11:02.684 --> 01:11:06.506]  Let's do that next hour from the UN and all the incredible announcements.
[01:11:06.526 --> 01:11:07.567]  We'll probably re-air those clips.
[01:11:07.927 --> 01:11:11.369]  They need to go together where he's, you know, up there saying China runs us, owns us.
[01:11:11.389 --> 01:11:15.591]  But just think about, imagine if Ronald Reagan said China owns us, it's over.
[01:11:16.513 --> 01:11:17.513]  We need to submit to them.
[01:11:17.573 --> 01:11:20.634]  Imagine if the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs said that under George W. Bush.
[01:11:21.034 --> 01:11:24.275]  George W. Bush would be, you know, removed.
[01:11:24.295 --> 01:11:35.558]  They've gotten so used to all these comics and all these Hollywood people and all these conquerors saying they care about everybody and then bringing in third world populations to hate America and hate white people.
[01:11:35.898 --> 01:11:36.598]  It's just sick.
[01:11:36.679 --> 01:11:38.119]  And I'll say this about finances.
[01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:43.423]  InfoWars is like a mothership now that boosts Project Veritas.
[01:11:43.823 --> 01:11:44.543]  And they'll tell you that.
[01:11:44.904 --> 01:11:46.004]  And it boosts everybody else.
[01:11:46.024 --> 01:11:47.345]  They've taken down almost everybody else.
[01:11:47.665 --> 01:11:48.586]  Tucker Carlson's there.
[01:11:48.686 --> 01:11:49.106]  We're there.
[01:11:49.587 --> 01:11:51.808]  That's about it at a major level.
[01:11:52.208 --> 01:11:55.310]  It'll really tell you what's going on at a hardcore point.
[01:11:55.350 --> 01:11:58.933]  You know, you've got like Ben Shapiro at first is for the vaccine, pushing it.
[01:12:00.254 --> 01:12:01.915]  And now he's like, oh, well, it shouldn't be forced.
[01:12:01.995 --> 01:12:03.696]  And I'm not in competition with Ben Shapiro.
[01:12:05.179 --> 01:12:18.045]  But he's what the system sells, the algorithm of Google pushes him, because that's what they want you to hear, is that type of pinhead conservatism that doesn't really get into the depths of what's happening, which makes it more of a cultural fight.
[01:12:18.305 --> 01:12:22.607]  The culture war is an artificial weapon system to play us off against each other.
[01:12:22.627 --> 01:12:32.712]  We need to understand we're at war, we're being attacked, and come together as Americans, every race, color, and creed, against the foreign banks coming in to bankrupt us and create a universal basic income.
[01:12:32.752 --> 01:12:37.463]   So, that said, I need you to tell everybody about the show.
[01:12:37.663 --> 01:12:38.503]  You've been doing it.
[01:12:38.744 --> 01:12:39.764]  We're having a huge effect.
[01:12:40.244 --> 01:12:45.567]  And we're like one of the main guns in the import war that's sinking a lot of globalist lies and rallying the people.
[01:12:45.627 --> 01:12:46.628]  That means we've got to do more.
[01:12:46.888 --> 01:12:47.748]  We've got to fight harder.
[01:12:47.768 --> 01:12:48.649]  We've got to be stronger.
[01:12:48.689 --> 01:12:49.249]  And I've been doing that.
[01:12:49.569 --> 01:12:54.452]  I've been working 14 to 16 hours a day, some days more, and I've been really focused.
[01:12:54.932 --> 01:12:56.373]  Because I'm here to mobilize people.
[01:12:56.613 --> 01:12:58.835]  We're not here to even try to get sheep to wake up anymore.
[01:12:59.075 --> 01:13:04.880]  We're here to get people that are already awake, that are already taking action, to realize now's the time for maximum effort to block the globalists.
[01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:09.683]  And then the sheep will see our leadership, which they're seeing, and figure out that we were right and join us.
[01:13:09.744 --> 01:13:15.448]  But at this point, we just got to tell it like it is, lay it all out, and financially support InfoWars.
[01:13:16.108 --> 01:13:17.890]  You need all the products we have already.
[01:13:17.930 --> 01:13:20.632]  So everybody needs to just say, they're coming after me and my family.
[01:13:20.652 --> 01:13:21.513]  They're coming after Alex.
[01:13:21.553 --> 01:13:22.413]  We're all in this together.
[01:13:23.336 --> 01:13:24.477]  We've got to keep InfoWars on the air.
[01:13:24.878 --> 01:13:29.904]  InfoWars has a lot of projects and a lot of new things we need to do that take money to carry out.
[01:13:29.924 --> 01:13:34.549]  We have to have our own infrastructure, our own servers, millions and millions a quarter just in bandwidth cost.
[01:13:35.771 --> 01:13:39.175]  And so our popularity is, you see the millions of views a day on Band.Video.
[01:13:40.416 --> 01:13:41.537]  Millions and millions and millions a day.
[01:13:41.597 --> 01:13:42.498]  That costs money.
[01:13:42.739 --> 01:13:43.419]  I'm not complaining.
[01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:45.382]  I'm just saying we're not funded by the globalists.
[01:13:45.402 --> 01:13:46.583]  So thank you for your support.
[01:13:47.023 --> 01:13:51.188]  Please go to m4warrestore.com and there are a bunch of sales that end on Monday.
[01:13:51.508 --> 01:13:52.970]  That's the Ultra 12 Vitamin B12.
[01:13:53.010 --> 01:13:55.633]  That's the Winter Sun Highest Quality Vitamin D3 at 50% off.
[01:13:59.229 --> 01:14:00.569]  That deal ends on Monday.
[01:14:00.590 --> 01:14:07.192]  You can call toll-free, 888-253-3139 if you want to order that as well, but I'd stock up on it.
[01:14:07.372 --> 01:14:08.552]  Everybody needs D3.
[01:14:08.973 --> 01:14:10.433]  Everybody needs vitamin B12.
[01:14:10.553 --> 01:14:12.994]  It's the highest rated, highest quality.
[01:14:13.034 --> 01:14:13.694]  Take it under the tongues.
[01:14:13.714 --> 01:14:14.655]  You get higher absorption.
[01:14:14.675 --> 01:14:20.297]  A lot of people can't absorb a lot of B12 or D in the stomach, D3.
[01:14:20.677 --> 01:14:22.677]  So it's really good to get into the blood vessels in your mouth.
[01:14:22.717 --> 01:14:24.418]  That's where digestion really starts.
[01:14:24.438 --> 01:14:26.579]  That's why you have saliva and why you have all the blood vessels in the mouth.
[01:14:27.159 --> 01:14:28.600]  And so, it's really important.
[01:14:28.620 --> 01:14:29.541]  It's what I do every day.
[01:14:30.182 --> 01:14:32.604]  Both of them taste naturally sweet with no sweetener added.
[01:14:32.624 --> 01:14:34.446]  People say, well, it doesn't say sweetener, but it's sweet.
[01:14:34.806 --> 01:14:36.728]  D3, that's organic and real, is sweet.
[01:14:37.309 --> 01:14:39.250]  And so is B12, that's organic and real.
[01:14:39.951 --> 01:14:40.832]  So, it's amazing.
[01:14:40.932 --> 01:14:41.973]  Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:14:41.993 --> 01:14:43.654]  And the sale also ends Monday.
[01:14:47.665 --> 01:14:54.673]  All the apparel, the ball caps, the t-shirts, the designer t-shirts, the limited edition shirts, all of them are being sold at cost.
[01:14:54.713 --> 01:14:56.275]  As low as $9.95, as high as $14.95.
[01:14:57.436 --> 01:15:00.599]  That is how we fund our operation and spread the word in the third dimension.
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:08.929]  Oh, and just in a minute as we go to break, wow, Project Veritas got censored within hours on Instagram and other places putting up the video we're about to break down.
[01:15:09.517 --> 01:15:21.243]  Well, this is one of those things, maybe a straw that can break the camel's back, coming from inside hospitals, coming from federal health care workers, telling you you've been lied to about the vaccine.
[01:15:21.703 --> 01:15:23.844]  Inside the hospitals, they know it's killing people.
[01:15:24.485 --> 01:15:26.786]  The VAERS reports, they're not even fully reporting it.
[01:15:26.826 --> 01:15:27.446]  We have that too.
[01:15:27.506 --> 01:15:33.509]  So the 15,000 deaths from the vaccines this year, they now admit that that's only a fraction of them.
[01:15:33.549 --> 01:15:34.970]  And it's all in this one little report.
[01:15:35.370 --> 01:15:37.451]  I mean, where does Project Veritas go next?
[01:15:37.491 --> 01:15:40.432]  I mean, to the stars for Project Veritas.
[01:15:40.892 --> 01:15:44.773]  And what's incredible, people say, oh, are these federal regulators and nurses and doctors right?
[01:15:45.374 --> 01:15:50.495]  It's all in the original report that I've got right here from October, where the feds knew it was going to cause these reactions.
[01:15:50.835 --> 01:15:52.096]  This was premeditated.
[01:15:52.416 --> 01:15:54.637]  Fauci works for the Rockefeller Foundation and Gates.
[01:15:54.897 --> 01:15:56.317]  They made the weapons with the Chinese.
[01:15:56.537 --> 01:15:57.158]  They released it.
[01:15:57.178 --> 01:15:57.858]  We're under attack.
[01:15:58.378 --> 01:16:01.659]  Man, I was in West Virginia yesterday, and it is pretty.
[01:16:03.900 --> 01:16:04.861]  My jeans or whatever.
[01:16:04.881 --> 01:16:05.881]  I guess it looks like Europe or something.
[01:16:05.901 --> 01:16:06.962]  I was like, I want to be here.
[01:16:07.502 --> 01:16:07.882]  Gorgeous.
[01:16:07.902 --> 01:16:08.322]  You ever been there?
[01:16:08.802 --> 01:16:09.603]  Yeah, I have.
[01:16:09.843 --> 01:16:13.885]  And in fact, we were driving through one time in the Infowars truck.
[01:16:14.425 --> 01:16:20.748]  There was a perfect snowfall, just perfectly painting the mountains white and the tops of the trees white.
[01:16:20.808 --> 01:16:26.271]   It's a beautiful American landscape that Well, the globalists are trying to deny from us.
[01:16:26.431 --> 01:16:26.951]  Absolutely.
[01:16:27.051 --> 01:16:28.992]  All right, James O'Keefe's coming on next hour.
[01:16:29.012 --> 01:16:40.256]  He had an emergency come up, but from their studios, Jody O'Malley, MSNRN, HHS whistleblower, in the bombshell, now censored off a bunch of platforms.
[01:16:41.056 --> 01:16:47.866]  Interview with her and others, seeing people come in and get sick, seeing them getting very, very ill, having COVID-like symptoms from the vaccine.
[01:16:48.207 --> 01:16:50.510]  I've been told it's the medical doctors that run hospitals on air.
[01:16:50.851 --> 01:16:52.774]  I've been told off record as well because they're scared.
[01:16:53.355 --> 01:16:54.737]  I know some doctors here in Austin.
[01:16:55.619 --> 01:16:59.979]   that it took care of my parents that are very nice, a husband and wife who work at a major hospital.
[01:16:59.979 --> 01:17:04.699]   And they said they're told basically not to say that it's the injections that are doing it.
[01:17:04.699 --> 01:17:10.340]   And then we know officially for 14 days, if you die in 14 days after getting Moderna or Pfizer,
[01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:15.338]  the FDA and the CDC don't count that as a vaccinated person.
[01:17:15.338 --> 01:17:20.579]   So if you take those numbers and add it together with all the numbers we've got, it's pretty shocking.
[01:17:20.579 --> 01:17:26.019]   So Jody O'Malley, we appreciate your courage and what you've done and now we've seen
[01:17:26.019 --> 01:17:28.378]  your whistleblower stuff, your undercover things.
[01:17:28.378 --> 01:17:29.619]  It's so great to have you here.
[01:17:29.619 --> 01:17:31.059]  Tell us about yourself and.
[01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:43.648]  Why you've gone public and just what you what you want to warn people because I know you're here to warn people and you've put your whole you know job on the line and they're so scary because you're with Health and Human Services to have somebody like you come out and tell the truth.
[01:17:43.668 --> 01:17:47.730]  So thank you for standing up against these crimes against humanity and for the Nuremberg Code.
[01:17:49.771 --> 01:17:50.332]  Thank you.
[01:17:50.352 --> 01:17:55.175]  So I am a master's prepared critical care nurse.
[01:17:56.351 --> 01:18:01.254]  I graduated nursing school when I was 39, so just eight years ago or something.
[01:18:01.274 --> 01:18:06.016]  It's always been a passion of mine to help people in that way.
[01:18:06.036 --> 01:18:13.480]  And being a nurse in my hospital, I work float pools, so I see it all.
[01:18:14.156 --> 01:18:19.500]  I see it from the people coming into the emergency room that are fine.
[01:18:20.621 --> 01:18:22.422]  The some that are not so fine.
[01:18:22.923 --> 01:18:23.923]  Most are fine.
[01:18:23.943 --> 01:18:28.226]  I see it from a med surge nurse perspective.
[01:18:28.747 --> 01:18:31.709]  I see it from an intensive care nurse perspective.
[01:18:32.169 --> 01:18:36.813]  And I also see it from an administrative perspective because I work house supervisor.
[01:18:37.506 --> 01:18:43.873]  So I'm also very much privy to the reporting and how these numbers are reported.
[01:18:45.074 --> 01:18:54.905]  So you're in a key position both from training and jobs and managerial areas to get a really good wide spectrum view of this to be able to give us an expert opinion is what you're saying.
[01:18:55.956 --> 01:18:56.696]  Absolutely.
[01:18:56.997 --> 01:19:10.963]  And, you know, I have a lot of nurse friends that are just in one area, you know, ER or ICU or med surge, and I'm screaming to them like, stop putting out that fear, guys.
[01:19:11.343 --> 01:19:16.585]  Like, you're only seeing it, you're seeing the sickest of the sick, right?
[01:19:16.765 --> 01:19:19.607]  I mean, that's kind of hard to see on a daily basis.
[01:19:20.727 --> 01:19:22.268]  But then there's so 99.7% that aren't.
[01:19:25.820 --> 01:19:26.082]  You know?
[01:19:27.005 --> 01:19:31.166]  Well, they have fought, and I'm sure you know this, Instagram, a bunch of other places have pulled it.
[01:19:31.226 --> 01:19:32.826]  We're going to have James on next hour about this.
[01:19:33.206 --> 01:19:41.148]  But imagine, you have a voice as an American, this video goes out, you show the proof with other valiant individuals, and now they're trying to silence you.
[01:19:41.168 --> 01:19:44.709]  But we've got millions of listeners and viewers are going to take this interview, they're going to magnify it.
[01:19:45.049 --> 01:19:57.451]   So here's your chance to do what you've been doing and to break this Berlin Wall, this electronic iron curtain of censorship, and to warn people, as a caregiver who wants to help people, Tell us what's really happening.
[01:19:59.172 --> 01:20:05.334]  Well, what's really happening is the reporting of the numbers are very skewed.
[01:20:05.754 --> 01:20:08.475]  We're getting a lot of hospital admissions.
[01:20:09.516 --> 01:20:14.297]  You know, the doc will call up and tell me, hey, I got a COVID pneumonia.
[01:20:15.258 --> 01:20:18.579]  They're going to go to MedSurg observation, say, right?
[01:20:18.979 --> 01:20:21.100]  And I said, OK, are they on oxygen?
[01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:21.760]  No.
[01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:24.561]  OK, well, why are we admitting them?
[01:20:25.788 --> 01:20:26.048]  Right?
[01:20:26.128 --> 01:20:27.550]  That's one perspective.
[01:20:27.930 --> 01:20:29.231]  Here's another perspective.
[01:20:29.791 --> 01:20:42.942]  I'll get a diabetic ketoacidosis admission that they're there for an extremely high uncontrolled blood sugar, but they're COVID positive.
[01:20:43.943 --> 01:20:49.948]  So now they're added to my COVID admissions, but COVID is just an incidental finding.
[01:20:51.609 --> 01:20:53.591]  That has nothing to do with it, right?
[01:20:54.390 --> 01:20:57.811]  Um, you know, and then also to the early treatment.
[01:20:58.211 --> 01:21:03.292]  I've known about the frontline doctors and America's frontline doctors.
[01:21:03.332 --> 01:21:07.954]  When I saw them last year, I was like, yes, yes, yes.
[01:21:08.534 --> 01:21:11.735]  Somebody speaking out like, yay, this will change.
[01:21:12.355 --> 01:21:13.395]  And it only got worse.
[01:21:14.305 --> 01:21:16.766]  And it's because of the censorship.
[01:21:16.846 --> 01:21:22.427]  It's because they're having, you know, no scientific debate is allowed.
[01:21:23.147 --> 01:21:39.472]  And for me, when that happened to my co-worker who wanted the ivermectin and didn't get it, you know, prior to that, there's an ER doc that I really hope comes forward because he's been instrumental in this with me.
[01:21:40.032 --> 01:21:45.213]  And he was telling me, Jodi, it's not chess, it's not checkers, it's chess.
[01:21:46.013 --> 01:21:47.874]  And I said, okay, you're right.
[01:21:48.234 --> 01:21:54.795]  Now that I know enough about early treatment, I'm just gonna start telling everybody about it, you know?
[01:21:55.575 --> 01:21:59.696]  And just speaking up and saying, hey guys, this is an option.
[01:22:01.676 --> 01:22:16.726]   And then when my boss brought me into the office and said, They're going to start reporting you to the Board of Nursing for speaking against anything that the FDA has not used for an emergency use authorization.
[01:22:16.846 --> 01:22:19.428]  And again, I've talked to medical doctors face-to-face in Austin.
[01:22:19.468 --> 01:22:26.794]  My parents have talked to other doctors face-to-face and told them the same thing, who are quitting and leaving and setting up their own practices because they're so freaked out by this.
[01:22:26.834 --> 01:22:42.892]   And let's be clear, They've been using a PCR test that's false positive 94% of the time, even according to the New York Times, to then sometimes even put people in the hospital that like you said are having diabetic shock or something, they'll still, I've read the articles out of New York, stick a ventilator down their throat and
[01:22:42.771 --> 01:22:43.851]  And it's just crazy.
[01:22:43.851 --> 01:22:48.530]   So what you're seeing is what the corporatization, how they give the orders from on high
[01:22:48.530 --> 01:22:51.610]   and then that's implemented, regardless what the doctors and nurses are saying.
[01:22:51.610 --> 01:22:54.351]   And then if you speak out, they were gonna get you in trouble.
[01:22:54.351 --> 01:22:58.530]   So you, I guess you and others, I've seen the videos, recorded other people agreeing with
[01:22:58.530 --> 01:23:00.231]   you to show that you weren't the only one.
[01:23:00.231 --> 01:23:01.692]  Is that what happened?
[01:23:01.692 --> 01:23:03.931]  Oh yeah, so many people agree with me.
[01:23:03.931 --> 01:23:10.891]   I mean, as far as a PCR test goes, that was never intended to be diagnostic.
[01:23:10.871 --> 01:23:15.955]  But yet we've drove this entire pandemic over two narratives in my mind.
[01:23:16.315 --> 01:23:21.480]  One, asymptomatic transmission, telling people that they can kill someone and not know it.
[01:23:22.659 --> 01:23:25.001]  Completely unscientific.
[01:23:25.481 --> 01:23:27.822]  Rarely, rarely, rarely ever happens.
[01:23:28.242 --> 01:23:31.544]  And PCR tests that there's no standard.
[01:23:31.904 --> 01:23:39.308]  At my hospital, when I was house supervisor, I went downstairs and I talked to our lab department and I said, what's our cycle threshold?
[01:23:39.628 --> 01:23:41.670]  And they said 51 minutes.
[01:23:43.170 --> 01:23:49.654]  It's only supposed to be at the max 24 to have any clinical significance.
[01:23:50.458 --> 01:23:55.424]  So you can see where, you know, every single hospital, everybody's doing it different.
[01:23:55.744 --> 01:23:57.286]  No lab is ever the same.
[01:23:57.786 --> 01:24:01.050]  All labs have different cycle thresholds.
[01:24:01.611 --> 01:24:03.032]  So what are we doing, you know?
[01:24:04.045 --> 01:24:05.366]  Where do you see this going?
[01:24:05.406 --> 01:24:12.128]  Because there are armies of nurses and doctors and scientists, and even now the FDA scientist came out and said, don't give children this, don't give boosters.
[01:24:12.408 --> 01:24:13.829]  The media didn't even report on that.
[01:24:14.149 --> 01:24:15.629]  That happened last Friday and Saturday.
[01:24:16.109 --> 01:24:22.432]  So, I mean, I see the corporations moving forward no matter what comes out, but I see it creating a massive resistance worldwide.
[01:24:22.452 --> 01:24:23.332]  Where do you see this going?
[01:24:24.413 --> 01:24:30.695]  Well, where I hope it goes is for people to not operate in fear.
[01:24:31.408 --> 01:24:45.483]  And to stick to that little whisper that, you know, we're given to us by God, you know, that is not from that doesn't happen from our own ego, you know, and when you get that little feeling not to do something, don't do it.
[01:24:45.983 --> 01:24:55.270]   Start conforming your communities of people so that if you need a doctor, if you're sick, You know, you can reach out to them and you'll have somebody.
[01:24:55.310 --> 01:24:58.690]  If you need a chiropractor, if you need food, you've got a farmer.
[01:24:59.010 --> 01:25:00.091]  Those types of things.
[01:25:00.631 --> 01:25:16.574]  Absolutely, and I hope you can stay with us longer because I want to, but every doctor and every nurse we have on that's been through this, especially the ones that have been battle-tested and have all these different disciplinary, you know, degrees, tell us that you've got to go out and find the good hospitals and doctors now because if you find the wrong ones, you're dead.
[01:25:17.774 --> 01:25:18.335]  Absolutely.
[01:25:18.435 --> 01:25:21.639]  I mean, right now, everybody needs to take their health seriously.
[01:25:22.821 --> 01:25:27.627]  You know, we don't know how this virus will mutate and what they'll come up with next.
[01:25:28.008 --> 01:25:30.010]  But overall, I want to tell people this.
[01:25:31.132 --> 01:25:38.022]   For the overall majority, 99.7% Will survive and be okay.
[01:25:38.402 --> 01:25:49.499]   Okay, so don't think like this is just something like oh, you're you know We're all gonna die and that's if they get the right treatment correct not if you get a ventilator Well, no.
[01:25:49.660 --> 01:25:51.961]  That's even before the vaccine came out.
[01:25:52.021 --> 01:25:53.062]  Those are our numbers.
[01:25:53.402 --> 01:25:53.643]  Wow.
[01:25:53.963 --> 01:25:54.823]  Okay, stay there.
[01:25:54.844 --> 01:25:57.666]  I want to hear about the whistleblowing.
[01:25:57.686 --> 01:26:01.809]  For people that haven't seen the full report at Project Veritas, it's also up on InfoWars.
[01:26:02.389 --> 01:26:04.271]  This is a war, folks, an InfoWar.
[01:26:04.871 --> 01:26:07.593]  And so, it's the COVID-19 Vaccine Exposed Part 1.
[01:26:08.114 --> 01:26:09.835]  It's at Project Veritas' website.
[01:26:10.195 --> 01:26:12.177]  We have a very special guest, Jody O'Malley.
[01:26:13.066 --> 01:26:15.547]  Well, Jodi O'Malley is only going to do five more minutes with us.
[01:26:15.567 --> 01:26:17.789]  I'd love to get her back up, but she can do a longer interview.
[01:26:18.809 --> 01:26:21.291]  But just, you've got the floor here in the five minutes we have.
[01:26:21.711 --> 01:26:30.616]  What else as a major whistleblower, MSN, RN, HHS whistleblower in Health and Human Services, what else do you want to impart to this audience?
[01:26:32.477 --> 01:26:40.878]   I want people to know that Let's take our kids for example, okay?
[01:26:40.978 --> 01:26:45.482]  From the ages of 0 to 17, there's approximately 75 million.
[01:26:47.043 --> 01:26:58.773]  But maybe last week or something, I saw that there were 400 deaths with a positive COVID number or with a positive COVID result, okay?
[01:26:59.093 --> 01:27:02.436]  So 400 and a population of 75 million.
[01:27:03.957 --> 01:27:13.320]  To give you an idea, I believe that there is about 50,000 that have died over the last 18 months.
[01:27:13.940 --> 01:27:15.781]  It's a normal number, right?
[01:27:15.861 --> 01:27:17.282]  Everything is included in that.
[01:27:17.362 --> 01:27:21.663]  Suicides, birth, cancer, all of it, okay?
[01:27:22.103 --> 01:27:27.265]  So out of that, you have 400 or so deaths with a positive COVID number.
[01:27:27.965 --> 01:27:34.590]  If you just look at the facts, that is statistically a 0% chance of dying.
[01:27:35.091 --> 01:27:35.731]  Zero!
[01:27:36.252 --> 01:27:36.592]  Okay?
[01:27:37.192 --> 01:27:45.038]  So, the fact that they're pushing this on our kids is absolutely evil at its highest form.
[01:27:45.418 --> 01:27:47.340]  Because there is no reason for it.
[01:27:47.950 --> 01:27:51.371]  Kids mostly have asymptomatic, right?
[01:27:51.431 --> 01:27:52.792]  They don't even know they have it.
[01:27:53.152 --> 01:27:57.814]  And if they do have it, they just have like a cold-like symptoms.
[01:27:58.234 --> 01:28:06.677]  But yet we are ruining their education and messing with their spiritual and mental health like no other.
[01:28:07.937 --> 01:28:15.817]   So please, I do not recommend at all for Really, honestly, let me put it to you this way.
[01:28:16.157 --> 01:28:24.926]  My dad, who has almost every comorbidity that you can imagine, I do not recommend the vaccine for him.
[01:28:25.387 --> 01:28:25.787]  Okay?
[01:28:25.827 --> 01:28:28.850]  And again, I'm sure you know better than I, but it's not even technically a vaccine.
[01:28:28.870 --> 01:28:30.252]  They've had to change the definition of that.
[01:28:30.292 --> 01:28:31.953]  It's a gene therapy.
[01:28:32.173 --> 01:28:40.197]   And just for folks that don't know, From your expert view, why do you think they're so hell-bent on targeting children, even though they know there's going to be problems and deaths?
[01:28:40.237 --> 01:28:41.998]  Particularly, it's been already in teenagers.
[01:28:42.459 --> 01:28:44.320]  Why are they being so reckless, so crazy?
[01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:47.203]  It's like a gun is to Fauci and Bill Gates' head.
[01:28:47.563 --> 01:28:49.925]  What do you and the other nurses and doctors think behind this?
[01:28:52.279 --> 01:29:06.915]  Well, about control, I've had people tell me that they think it, you know, to sterilize the children, to kill off our children in some way, shape or form, a really whole society.
[01:29:06.935 --> 01:29:11.820]  I am like probably the majority of Americans, Alex.
[01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:14.683]  I haven't heard of you.
[01:29:15.777 --> 01:29:18.698]  I just heard of you this year and so many others.
[01:29:19.099 --> 01:29:24.641]  Conspiracy theorists and all of that was something, you know, that was just a bad word.
[01:29:25.101 --> 01:29:33.745]  Now I almost take pride in that word because conspiracy theorists almost is like you're a critical thinker and that's what they don't want you to do anymore.
[01:29:33.805 --> 01:29:35.445]  They don't want you to critically think.
[01:29:35.485 --> 01:29:36.886]  They just want you to comply.
[01:29:37.566 --> 01:29:39.807]  And are you being persecuted?
[01:29:40.067 --> 01:29:40.927]  Are you being fired?
[01:29:41.007 --> 01:29:43.228]  And I know that you're going through a lot doing this.
[01:29:43.468 --> 01:29:44.529]  How is your job right now?
[01:29:45.695 --> 01:29:46.717]  I haven't heard from them.
[01:29:46.737 --> 01:30:00.838]  I was supposed to work on Sunday, but I called in telling them that I needed to take care of my spiritual and mental health and that I needed to really sit back and think.
[01:30:01.278 --> 01:30:07.304]  What it meant to be a federal employee and uphold my oath to do no harm at the same time.
[01:30:07.344 --> 01:30:08.345]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:30:08.385 --> 01:30:10.727]  Did you have a burning to warn people when you saw this happen?
[01:30:10.887 --> 01:30:15.832]  And A, and then B, are you feeling stronger and more empowered now that you've made this courageous step?
[01:30:17.093 --> 01:30:18.735]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:30:19.395 --> 01:30:23.199]  The first part, did you say about having a burning desire?
[01:30:24.460 --> 01:30:24.680]  Yes.
[01:30:26.056 --> 01:30:27.977]  Yes, I had a burning desire.
[01:30:28.017 --> 01:30:31.098]  I mean, I've been screaming this to my Facebook community.
[01:30:31.838 --> 01:30:36.761]  Anybody can go on my Facebook page and see all of the public comments that I made.
[01:30:37.441 --> 01:30:42.723]  I just never said I was a federal employee, so people didn't know that I worked with the... We're out of time.
[01:30:42.743 --> 01:30:43.323]  You're out of time.
[01:30:43.363 --> 01:30:44.144]  You're a beautiful lady.
[01:30:44.184 --> 01:30:45.264]  Your soul's beautiful, Judy.
[01:30:46.565 --> 01:30:48.205]  Jody, how do people find you on Facebook?
[01:30:48.465 --> 01:30:49.106]  What's the handle?
[01:30:49.126 --> 01:30:49.666]  What's the name?
[01:30:51.407 --> 01:30:54.208]  Go to Instagram and Nurse for Natives.
[01:30:54.992 --> 01:30:56.152]  Nurse for Natives.
[01:30:56.393 --> 01:30:59.674]  All right, Jody O'Malley, an amazing lady with HHS.
[01:30:59.714 --> 01:31:00.314]  God bless you.
[01:31:00.554 --> 01:31:01.334]  Please join us again.
[01:31:01.514 --> 01:31:03.575]  We are back live now into hour number three.
[01:31:04.295 --> 01:31:06.236]  James O'Keefe just had an amazing whistleblower.
[01:31:06.696 --> 01:31:08.677]  Jody O'Malley, very powerful along with us.
[01:31:08.697 --> 01:31:10.177]  He'll be joining us later in the hour.
[01:31:10.197 --> 01:31:11.197]  He's in an emergency meeting.
[01:31:11.217 --> 01:31:11.918]  So much is breaking.
[01:31:11.957 --> 01:31:15.518]   I know the feeling of being in a war room where just stuff is coming in so fast
[01:31:15.518 --> 01:31:17.537]  and you've just got to defend the Republic.
[01:31:17.537 --> 01:31:23.357]   What an incredible time, borders wide open, UN financed invasions, all the big comedians,
[01:31:23.357 --> 01:31:29.836]   you know, that the media is pushing saying America sucks, America's Nazis, America's Hitler, get rid of America.
[01:31:29.836 --> 01:31:34.636]   American flags are bad, world government's good, Biden pledging allegiance to China.
[01:31:34.636 --> 01:31:40.476]   We played it last hour saying China owns us, we are mortgaged, you know, there's nothing we can do.
[01:31:40.476 --> 01:31:45.557]   And laughing about the crowd clapping, Millie saying it, all of this.
[01:31:45.557 --> 01:31:50.036]   And then you hear Jodi O'Malley, she's what they fear before they get their robots in place,
[01:31:50.036 --> 01:31:57.117]   which is long off, is their own people finding their soul and standing up and she's so empowered now.
[01:31:58.069 --> 01:32:02.654]  Recording the doctors, recording the other nurses, knowing it's the vaccines, admitting it's the vaccines.
[01:32:03.175 --> 01:32:07.119]  I mean, there's like 30 minutes of doctors and, oh, the vaccine got it, killed them.
[01:32:07.399 --> 01:32:08.040]  Oh, they're dying.
[01:32:08.140 --> 01:32:09.922]  Oh, our own nurses are dying from the shot.
[01:32:10.442 --> 01:32:14.227]  And then they're all going to report her because she bitched on Facebook or Instagram.
[01:32:14.427 --> 01:32:17.150]  So she just recorded all them admitting they know what they're doing.
[01:32:17.870 --> 01:32:18.832]  Look, Fauci!
[01:32:20.103 --> 01:32:22.404]  And I know Bill Gates has a compulsion to kill people.
[01:32:22.464 --> 01:32:23.064]  He can't help it.
[01:32:23.444 --> 01:32:25.365]  So everybody thinks, well, they must be in charge if they're doing this.
[01:32:25.425 --> 01:32:25.665]  No.
[01:32:26.125 --> 01:32:27.426]  They're just like every other tyrant.
[01:32:27.566 --> 01:32:32.728]  They're gonna lose because they're not gonna stop until all of you have to finally wake up or you're dead.
[01:32:33.593 --> 01:32:34.854]  So they will go down.
[01:32:35.414 --> 01:32:36.695]  They're making a real run at us.
[01:32:36.775 --> 01:32:37.536]  I've studied history.
[01:32:37.556 --> 01:32:39.637]  Everybody better get that through your heads.
[01:32:39.657 --> 01:32:43.159]  And I mean that to our general audience, but also the Dumbo liberals that tune in.
[01:32:43.199 --> 01:32:44.460]  You're not part of the establishment.
[01:32:44.660 --> 01:32:46.681]  You're useless eaters to the globalists.
[01:32:47.102 --> 01:32:48.162]  I don't want to kill you.
[01:32:48.503 --> 01:32:49.763]  I don't want to be at war with you.
[01:32:50.104 --> 01:32:51.184]  I want to empower you.
[01:32:51.545 --> 01:32:54.507]  But I assure you that you are dead.
[01:32:55.387 --> 01:32:58.349]  In the next decade or so with this plan, because you heard that nurse earlier.
[01:32:58.629 --> 01:33:00.210]  She said, I don't know what they're going to hit us with next.
[01:33:00.731 --> 01:33:01.872]  All the doctors know.
[01:33:02.152 --> 01:33:03.833]  They've already looked at it under microscopes.
[01:33:04.053 --> 01:33:04.854]  They've already looked at it.
[01:33:04.894 --> 01:33:09.917]  It's synthetic spike protein that they could be spraying on us, or it's coming from the vaccine.
[01:33:10.117 --> 01:33:20.517]   The FDA voted 16 to 2 Saturday, and their scientists kept getting up there on the board saying, Saying that it's the vaccine that caused this.
[01:33:21.359 --> 01:33:22.722]  But I'm not even sure if that's the case.
[01:33:23.103 --> 01:33:25.849]  Owen, what do you make of this incredible time we're alive in right now?
[01:33:26.490 --> 01:33:27.593]  Well, she said something.
[01:33:28.945 --> 01:33:37.674]  She said, hey, you know, Alex, I hadn't heard of you until about a year ago and maybe I saw your name and you were labeled as a conspiracy theorist or the guest you had on.
[01:33:38.134 --> 01:33:44.861]  And what I'm seeing happening now is that info wars, use whatever analogy, it's like a funnel of truth or a black hole of reality.
[01:33:45.321 --> 01:33:50.786]  And it's, you know, it's well, you know, anytime in a funnel, the point where it goes through is the smallest point.
[01:33:50.846 --> 01:33:57.990]   So somebody like Jody O'Malley, She wants to warn Americans what's going on with the vaccines, what's going on with hospitals.
[01:33:58.010 --> 01:34:00.791]  So she thinks, okay, well, the outer rim is the mainstream media.
[01:34:01.031 --> 01:34:01.872]  So that's where you start.
[01:34:01.912 --> 01:34:04.852]  And she realizes, wait, none of these people are interested in covering the story.
[01:34:04.872 --> 01:34:06.113]  In fact, they're covering it up.
[01:34:06.453 --> 01:34:07.393]  What is going on here?
[01:34:07.453 --> 01:34:13.975]  And so slowly but surely, she gets all the way down to the bottom of the funnel of reality, the bottom of the black hole of truth.
[01:34:14.075 --> 01:34:14.735]  And where is it?
[01:34:15.016 --> 01:34:15.936]  It's Infowars!
[01:34:16.636 --> 01:34:18.357]  Nobody else will have these guests on!
[01:34:18.397 --> 01:34:18.978]  Or Veritas.
[01:34:18.998 --> 01:34:19.858]  They're all afraid!
[01:34:19.918 --> 01:34:22.140]  It's Project Veritas, it's InfoWars, and there's other great people.
[01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:22.940]  And Tucker Carlson.
[01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:25.882]  But no, we're only saying we are at the center of it.
[01:34:25.922 --> 01:34:28.724]  I mean, Tucker Carlson says that publicly because we're under attack.
[01:34:29.164 --> 01:34:33.887]  And that's why you praying for us is the one that's more important than money, more important than word of mouth, folks.
[01:34:33.927 --> 01:34:36.769]  We need those prayers as a literal spiritual force field.
[01:34:36.789 --> 01:34:38.190]  Because I can feel it and see it.
[01:34:38.691 --> 01:34:40.132]  Yeah, there's no doubt.
[01:34:40.172 --> 01:34:41.412]  And it's all of us coming together.
[01:34:41.452 --> 01:34:43.234]  And you know, here's the other thing too, Alex.
[01:34:45.308 --> 01:34:53.954]  People have been living agnostic or atheistic lifestyles because they haven't really seen the evil or been faced with the evil.
[01:34:54.034 --> 01:34:56.015]  Now the evil is just out and in the general public.
[01:34:56.055 --> 01:34:56.696]  It's gonna get worse.
[01:34:56.716 --> 01:34:59.538]  They're everywhere and so people are naturally turning back to God.
[01:34:59.558 --> 01:35:02.419]  It's like they say there's no atheists in foxholes.
[01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:06.482]  They're seeing the Satanists praise abortion.
[01:35:06.722 --> 01:35:11.924]   They're seeing the leftists They're mad that they can't stop a beating heart in the womb.
[01:35:12.204 --> 01:35:15.145]  They're seeing the borders being surrendered by Biden.
[01:35:15.446 --> 01:35:18.287]  They're seeing the politicians and the media lie to them 24-7.
[01:35:18.327 --> 01:35:26.269]  They're seeing all of these institutions and establishments in the legacy media and political class just done!
[01:35:26.429 --> 01:35:27.650]  Done with the Constitution!
[01:35:27.950 --> 01:35:29.110]  Done with the Bill of Rights!
[01:35:29.190 --> 01:35:30.371]  Done with your sovereignty!
[01:35:30.431 --> 01:35:31.251]  Done with all of it!
[01:35:31.631 --> 01:35:35.273]  And they're realizing, whoa, there really is something at my doorstep.
[01:35:35.573 --> 01:35:39.795]   Obama said, Don't listen to the voices out there telling you tyranny is around the corner.
[01:35:40.176 --> 01:35:41.076]  Really, Barack?
[01:35:41.437 --> 01:35:45.079]  Here we are, 2021, right around the corner, and what do we see?
[01:35:45.479 --> 01:35:49.142]  Global government, world tyranny, medical tyranny.
[01:35:49.502 --> 01:36:02.472]  If you went out and you asked somebody, because people's brains don't really function very well, sadly, these days with the food and the TV and everything, and you said, hi, sir, are you for forced medication?
[01:36:03.294 --> 01:36:05.415]  The natural response would be, no, I'm not for forced medication.
[01:36:05.435 --> 01:36:05.935]  Of course not.
[01:36:06.135 --> 01:36:10.017]  But then if you said, are you for forcing people to take a vaccine to vaccine mandate?
[01:36:10.157 --> 01:36:12.338]  Well, well now.
[01:36:12.638 --> 01:36:15.760]  Or you say, are you for them forcing experimental medicines on you?
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:16.900]  Yeah, you can go even further.
[01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:17.720]  Because it's experimental.
[01:36:17.740 --> 01:36:18.881]  Then they lied and said it wasn't.
[01:36:19.551 --> 01:36:30.038]  But imagine, as Tucker Carlson has said it, as Avell said it, hell, even there's a video of an Australian police officer being confronted about this saying, well, I don't like it either, I'm just doing my job, I'm just doing what they tell me to do.
[01:36:30.238 --> 01:36:30.478]  Really?
[01:36:30.498 --> 01:36:37.023]  Well, if they told you to put a Colt .45 up against their head and blow their brains out, would you do that too?
[01:36:37.583 --> 01:36:38.424]  Where is the line?
[01:36:38.484 --> 01:36:39.484]  Where is the line in the...
[01:36:39.484 --> 01:36:42.323]   By the way, I want to go back to the photo that I just put up for TV viewers, radio listeners,
[01:36:42.323 --> 01:36:43.323]  you can see this.
[01:36:43.323 --> 01:36:48.884]   It's a bunch of so-called movie stars and "hip-hop" and music stars doing the Illuminati
[01:36:48.884 --> 01:36:54.243]   one eye where they put their index and thumb together and the other three fingers sticking
[01:36:54.243 --> 01:36:55.244]  out.
[01:36:55.244 --> 01:37:01.363]   Now, that symbolizes occultism and Satanism and Luciferianism today.
[01:37:01.363 --> 01:37:06.163]   But really, God is connected to us through our third eye, our spirit, which they now
[01:37:06.163 --> 01:37:11.203]   scientifically know is just an interface in our brain but to a dimensional point beyond
[01:37:12.192 --> 01:37:16.174]  So they're all saying they're the Illuminati, they're illuminating, they have the third eye.
[01:37:16.354 --> 01:37:18.235]  So we didn't think illumination is bad.
[01:37:18.475 --> 01:37:19.796]  We didn't think the third eye is bad.
[01:37:20.076 --> 01:37:23.258]  They all have counterfeited that for Satan and are saying they're the third eye.
[01:37:23.538 --> 01:37:24.899]  They're saying they're the other dimension.
[01:37:25.099 --> 01:37:27.301]  They're saying they're the connection to God, but they're the opposite.
[01:37:27.601 --> 01:37:29.462]  They are the ones that don't have the connection to God.
[01:37:29.482 --> 01:37:30.983]  They're the ones that have sold out to Satan.
[01:37:31.593 --> 01:37:36.657]  And most of them probably don't even have a clue what they're getting involved with until they see it firsthand.
[01:37:37.358 --> 01:37:44.404]  Like that one young lady who talked about going to a Halloween party where they were taking your blood and said you can't have cell phones.
[01:37:44.444 --> 01:37:45.905]  That's not how you open your third eye.
[01:37:45.925 --> 01:37:48.527]  That's how you open yourself up to demonic, low-level stuff.
[01:37:48.847 --> 01:37:51.029]  If you open up the third eye, that's the Holy Spirit, folks.
[01:37:51.129 --> 01:37:55.253]  Then you start seeing further and further interconnection of the universe and God.
[01:37:55.893 --> 01:37:57.835]  And Satanists have zero of that.
[01:37:58.055 --> 01:38:01.279]  When you're into devil worship, you have zero third eye.
[01:38:01.620 --> 01:38:01.960]  Zero.
[01:38:02.120 --> 01:38:05.044]  They all tell you they've got it because they do not have it!
[01:38:05.224 --> 01:38:06.826]  They are going to take that away from you!
[01:38:07.827 --> 01:38:09.008]  And you realize how small you are.
[01:38:09.028 --> 01:38:09.969]  Look how pathetic they are.
[01:38:09.989 --> 01:38:12.231]  These people do not have a third eye that's open.
[01:38:12.531 --> 01:38:15.894]  Yeah, Marina Abramovic with Jay-Z there.
[01:38:16.774 --> 01:38:20.918]  But Alex, here's what it comes down to as we come... They'll come down to act like they're powerful all these weeks.
[01:38:20.938 --> 01:38:22.399]  Can you imagine being in a room?
[01:38:22.639 --> 01:38:24.181]  Just look at the empty weakness of these people.
[01:38:24.361 --> 01:38:26.002]  You can feel the resonance of that.
[01:38:26.322 --> 01:38:28.324]  That is the lowest level of failure on screen.
[01:38:28.584 --> 01:38:30.465]  I want to be as far away from that as possible.
[01:38:30.505 --> 01:38:33.926]  That has zero attractiveness to me at all.
[01:38:34.366 --> 01:38:34.747]  None of it.
[01:38:34.767 --> 01:38:35.887]  You know where the third eye is?
[01:38:35.947 --> 01:38:38.008]  It's on a mountaintop with your children and your wife.
[01:38:38.328 --> 01:38:41.389]  It's praising God and saying thank you God for this great creation you gave us.
[01:38:41.669 --> 01:38:42.550]  Thank you for your son.
[01:38:42.570 --> 01:38:43.650]  That opens the third eye.
[01:38:44.470 --> 01:38:50.473]  As we close this segment, Alex, here's the big picture that everybody needs to understand that you've been talking about for years.
[01:38:51.547 --> 01:38:55.788]  The global elite have created a breakaway civilization.
[01:38:56.108 --> 01:38:56.888]  They're done with us.
[01:38:57.308 --> 01:38:57.629]  Okay?
[01:38:57.969 --> 01:39:01.770]  The ship's about to leave the planet, not literally, but... They think literally.
[01:39:02.270 --> 01:39:03.430]  But this is the plan.
[01:39:03.490 --> 01:39:05.230]  They've been building a separate society.
[01:39:05.250 --> 01:39:06.651]  They're ready to break away from us.
[01:39:06.691 --> 01:39:08.011]  They're ready to rip the cord on us.
[01:39:08.351 --> 01:39:08.931]  They're done.
[01:39:08.951 --> 01:39:12.232]  And they look at it like they're doing us a favor, Alex.
[01:39:12.432 --> 01:39:24.419]   Well, we're gonna spare you and make us our slaves and our batteries and we'll feed you some garbage and we'll feed you some poop water and We're going to sterilize you and force-medicate you and put you in a prison, but hey, we let you survive.
[01:39:25.140 --> 01:39:25.740]  You're welcome.
[01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:26.681]  We're letting you survive.
[01:39:26.701 --> 01:39:27.222]  We're letting you live.
[01:39:27.262 --> 01:39:28.183]  It's our planet now.
[01:39:28.423 --> 01:39:30.365]  We could just be done with you and wipe you all out.
[01:39:30.385 --> 01:39:31.766]  Look at the Georgia Guidestones.
[01:39:32.086 --> 01:39:32.727]  And that's because they know.
[01:39:32.747 --> 01:39:33.668]  They tell us they're going to kill us.
[01:39:33.748 --> 01:39:34.549]  All right, we'll fight back.
[01:39:34.989 --> 01:39:37.932]  So it's just like, you're going to drink poop water and you're going to eat bugs.
[01:39:37.992 --> 01:39:39.953]  I mean, The Washington Post, both pages.
[01:39:40.253 --> 01:39:44.577]  We make cows have bags up their butts because they're evil, and you're evil too and you're going to eat garbage.
[01:39:44.777 --> 01:39:45.278]  Same page.
[01:39:45.318 --> 01:39:47.480]  People think that we're crazy if they tune in for the first time.
[01:39:47.500 --> 01:39:50.622]  Folks, Bill Gates is on record saying he wants you to drink poop water.
[01:39:50.962 --> 01:39:54.586]  You read the story earlier today saying they're upcycling trash for us to eat.
[01:39:54.606 --> 01:39:55.006]  Okay?
[01:39:55.967 --> 01:39:57.108]  I don't want to be a slave!
[01:39:57.228 --> 01:39:59.530]  I like living life to the fullest, damn it!
[01:39:59.570 --> 01:40:01.671]  Let's show a slave Biden at the UN when we come back.
[01:40:02.597 --> 01:40:06.138]  All right, we're gonna get to Puppet Biden at the UN this morning.
[01:40:06.899 --> 01:40:12.661]  But first, let's play him talking about the New World Order and saying China owns us one more time.
[01:40:12.761 --> 01:40:13.261]  Here it is.
[01:40:14.280 --> 01:40:22.039]   We, and particularly you, your class, has an incredible window of opportunity to lead
[01:40:22.039 --> 01:40:29.960]  in shaping a new world order for the 21st century.
[01:40:29.960 --> 01:40:39.400]   The affirmative task we have now is to actually create a new world order.
[01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:41.760]  A new world order.
[01:40:41.871 --> 01:40:47.734]  I do know a lot about foreign policy, as much as anybody in this room, including if you're Henry Kissinger, who I love.
[01:40:49.435 --> 01:40:53.117]  Folks, we have mortgaged our foreign policy.
[01:40:54.116 --> 01:40:57.298]  Everyone's out there going, oh my God, how in God's name?
[01:40:57.318 --> 01:41:00.541]  You know, the Chinese came here and the president didn't get anything.
[01:41:01.021 --> 01:41:01.621]  Guess what?
[01:41:01.721 --> 01:41:02.462]  They own us.
[01:41:05.844 --> 01:41:06.785]  How I loved...
[01:41:08.288 --> 01:41:09.088]  The New World Order.
[01:41:09.148 --> 01:41:11.669]  How I learned to love the New World Order.
[01:41:11.689 --> 01:41:15.050]  He had something he wrote in the New York Times, April 23rd, 1992.
[01:41:16.750 --> 01:41:19.871]  Why not breathe life into the UN Charter?
[01:41:20.811 --> 01:41:22.671]  Well, they've all gone and pledged allegiance to it.
[01:41:22.731 --> 01:41:24.352]  Owen Schroeder's riding shotgun with me.
[01:41:24.612 --> 01:41:26.192]  He's not hosting the War Room today at 3 p.m.
[01:41:26.552 --> 01:41:27.273]  Harrison Smith is.
[01:41:27.373 --> 01:41:30.453]  He hosted the Washington Journal this morning, 8 a.m.
[01:41:30.833 --> 01:41:33.454]  So we're shaking stuff up here, not because stuff's stagnant.
[01:41:33.474 --> 01:41:35.775]  We're just always shaking it up, taking it to the next level.
[01:41:37.574 --> 01:41:43.789]  When you add this to Millie and everything else, they're just, and Sarah Silverman, all of them, they're just preparing us to be slaves.
[01:41:43.950 --> 01:41:44.230]  It's here.
[01:41:45.199 --> 01:41:51.343]  Well, and when are we going to reach a threshold of Americans that are just sick and tired of this?
[01:41:52.004 --> 01:41:54.545]  And then what does the national debate become next?
[01:41:54.706 --> 01:42:04.953]  And I think that our election system has kind of been the focal point of this or the nucleus of this because we feel like we've already reached that threshold.
[01:42:05.353 --> 01:42:10.897]  And Build Back Better, we passed a long time ago, is the UN slogan for tearing everything down and bringing it in.
[01:42:10.937 --> 01:42:14.818]   And so where is Governor DeSantis, where is Governor Abbott?
[01:42:14.818 --> 01:42:17.617]  Where is Rand Paul?
[01:42:17.617 --> 01:42:19.617]  I mean, this is all world government out in the open.
[01:42:19.617 --> 01:42:22.618]   They admitted in the newspaper, and then none of them challenged it.
[01:42:22.618 --> 01:42:25.217]   None of them challenged a corporate authoritarian world government.
[01:42:25.217 --> 01:42:30.318]   They'll challenge the policies, but never rally Americans against the globalism,
[01:42:30.318 --> 01:42:31.418]  and that's why we're failing.
[01:42:31.418 --> 01:42:36.016]   That's why. That's why every day I hammer, "It's not Biden's the reason we're not slaves. It's that we've
[01:42:36.016 --> 01:42:36.818]  let him do this."
[01:42:37.037 --> 01:42:41.198]  This is how, and it's all about, oh my crackhead son can sell paintings for a million dollars or payoffs.
[01:42:41.618 --> 01:42:44.459]  I can have, you know, 100,000 Haitians run over the border if I want.
[01:42:44.839 --> 01:42:54.601]  We can say you're not essential and keep you in the house, but Hollywood's allowed to meet and hug each other, you know, because they're above the law, but we're going to arrest you if you're not wearing your mask in California on the street.
[01:42:54.881 --> 01:42:57.982]  I mean, it's all about them training us that they're above the law, Owen.
[01:42:58.402 --> 01:43:04.604]  Well, and look, the only one that got into a position of leadership that was rallying against globalism was Donald Trump.
[01:43:04.644 --> 01:43:05.324]  And what did we see?
[01:43:05.344 --> 01:43:07.325]  50,000 people per rally.
[01:43:07.345 --> 01:43:08.325]  50,000 people!
[01:43:08.445 --> 01:43:11.406]  And we've seen Bolsonaro, who's even better than Trump, stabbed.
[01:43:11.867 --> 01:43:14.427]  He can't go to a restaurant, which is fine.
[01:43:14.447 --> 01:43:18.529]  He eats pizza on the side of the road, because they all know who he is, and said, we won't let you in.
[01:43:18.749 --> 01:43:19.709]  The mayor said, don't come here.
[01:43:19.729 --> 01:43:23.671]  You didn't put in your body the shot we wanted, an experimental shot.
[01:43:23.931 --> 01:43:24.871]  What a freak show!
[01:43:25.171 --> 01:43:26.832]  We're already in a freak show!
[01:43:27.153 --> 01:43:28.073]  Wake up!
[01:43:28.414 --> 01:43:29.574]  Come out of the trance!
[01:43:29.915 --> 01:43:31.516]  Let's start getting to this disgusting speech.
[01:43:31.556 --> 01:43:32.577]  We'll play it and stop it.
[01:43:32.857 --> 01:43:36.580]  This is this morning at the UN General Assembly that the Rockefellers paid for.
[01:43:36.600 --> 01:43:38.481]  We're all under the Rockefeller system.
[01:43:38.501 --> 01:43:41.403]  It's a Rockefeller world right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:43:41.584 --> 01:43:42.064]  Here it is.
[01:43:43.465 --> 01:43:53.713]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the clear and urgent choice that we face here at the dawning of what must be a decisive decade for our world.
[01:43:54.764 --> 01:43:57.085]  A decade that will quite literally... Alright, stop there.
[01:43:57.105 --> 01:43:59.426]  And you see this in all the newspapers.
[01:43:59.986 --> 01:44:01.587]  This is the decade for globalism.
[01:44:01.627 --> 01:44:03.828]  This is the decade to make cows wear fart bags.
[01:44:04.188 --> 01:44:07.210]  This is the decade to make you eat garbage and drink sewage water and bugs.
[01:44:07.890 --> 01:44:10.571]  I showed you the Washington Post's article.
[01:44:10.591 --> 01:44:11.331]  You'll eat bugs.
[01:44:11.351 --> 01:44:12.312]  You'll eat rotten food.
[01:44:13.052 --> 01:44:14.153]  Fart bags on the cows.
[01:44:14.513 --> 01:44:15.773]  Potty training the cows are evil.
[01:44:15.793 --> 01:44:19.555]  I mean, it's all just total takeover, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:44:19.835 --> 01:44:22.697]  And this is their decade of overthrowing freedom and everything else.
[01:44:23.037 --> 01:44:23.497]  Keep rolling.
[01:44:24.228 --> 01:44:31.868]   As a global community, we're challenged by urgent and looming crises, wherein lie enormous
[01:44:31.868 --> 01:44:39.507]   opportunities if, if we can summon the will and resolve to seize these opportunities.
[01:44:39.507 --> 01:44:43.266]  Will we work together to save lives, defeat COVID-19?
[01:44:43.266 --> 01:44:44.266]  Head pause.
[01:44:44.266 --> 01:44:49.747]   When he had to fly on his private jet when it was broken, the climate czar John Kerry
[01:44:50.695 --> 01:44:52.836]  But oh look, he's wearing two at the UN.
[01:44:52.856 --> 01:44:54.376]  It was like a few weeks ago at 9-11.
[01:44:54.576 --> 01:44:58.157]  They're all back there in the area not wearing masks, but they put them on for TV.
[01:44:58.237 --> 01:44:59.317]  Again, it's all theater.
[01:44:59.337 --> 01:44:59.817]  Continue.
[01:44:59.897 --> 01:45:00.957]  He's double vaxxed.
[01:45:01.698 --> 01:45:07.099]  Take the necessary steps to prepare ourselves for the next pandemic, for there will be another one.
[01:45:07.959 --> 01:45:11.400]  Or will we fail to harness the tools at our disposal?
[01:45:11.740 --> 01:45:12.140]  Pause again.
[01:45:13.624 --> 01:45:23.573]  So, there will be another one because they're cooking them up because it's their power to take control as Operation Lockstep and their own UN documents the Judicial Watch got in 2007 said they would.
[01:45:23.753 --> 01:45:26.876]  People ask Owen Howe, I knew this was all coming, it's in all their damn plans, Owen!
[01:45:27.096 --> 01:45:28.398]  We have their freaking playbook!
[01:45:28.478 --> 01:45:31.340]  This is pretty, I've said it today Alex, this is a historic moment.
[01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:35.945]  I mean, Joe Biden has announced the USS surrendered to the globalist government, to the UN.
[01:45:36.225 --> 01:45:38.207]  Border's down, he's here announcing it.
[01:45:38.787 --> 01:45:43.030]  Oh, we're going to defeat COVID with the New World Order and then we're going after climate change.
[01:45:43.050 --> 01:45:44.411]  Well, what do you think he means by that?
[01:45:44.591 --> 01:45:49.575]  And Klaus Schwab and all of them say we're going to get used to lockdowns and tracker systems and then now it's going to be the carbon tax.
[01:45:49.615 --> 01:45:50.135]  It's official!
[01:45:50.596 --> 01:45:52.117]  And where are our leaders?
[01:45:52.157 --> 01:45:52.897]  Where's Rand Paul?
[01:45:53.237 --> 01:45:54.038]  Where's Ted Cruz?
[01:45:54.078 --> 01:45:54.879]  Where's Josh Hawley?
[01:45:56.360 --> 01:45:58.221]  Where's the West Virginia governor that's against carbon taxes?
[01:45:58.962 --> 01:46:03.345]  These apps are going to track us and tell us where we can go, what we can do officially.
[01:46:04.005 --> 01:46:05.507]  I've read four books by Schwab.
[01:46:05.547 --> 01:46:06.529]  He says them in four of them.
[01:46:06.729 --> 01:46:07.530]  He's on TV.
[01:46:07.590 --> 01:46:08.371]  He runs things.
[01:46:08.852 --> 01:46:09.372]  Bill Gates.
[01:46:10.033 --> 01:46:11.255]  Australia's already started it.
[01:46:11.575 --> 01:46:12.276]  It's care.
[01:46:12.897 --> 01:46:14.780]  But why won't they stand against it up front?
[01:46:14.840 --> 01:46:17.163]  Why do they always react instead of acting?
[01:46:17.383 --> 01:46:18.765]  Where's the sense of urgency?
[01:46:18.845 --> 01:46:26.150]   Where's a coalition of Representatives, it should be Democrats and Republicans that want Americans to be sovereign and live in a free nation.
[01:46:26.170 --> 01:46:30.152]  That shouldn't be a Republican thing, or a one-party thing, or a one-individual thing.
[01:46:30.632 --> 01:46:38.176]  Where is anybody that wants to pick up the energy and the steam where Trump left off, having 50,000 people at a rally, rallying against the globalists?
[01:46:38.196 --> 01:46:45.259]  Because he wasn't a globalist for all his faults, but they are all put in power, bought and paid for and picked because they write op-eds in the New York Times.
[01:46:46.159 --> 01:46:50.041]  30 years ago saying, I want to get rid of America and have the UN run everything.
[01:46:50.261 --> 01:46:51.582]  And that's what the new world order is.
[01:46:51.802 --> 01:46:57.985]  Folks, the UN runs giant child kidnapping rings, huge extermination genocide operations in Rwanda, everywhere else.
[01:46:58.185 --> 01:47:04.928]  They have thousands of slaves at their headquarters all over the world, trimming the grass with scissors.
[01:47:05.288 --> 01:47:06.649]  They hate everyone.
[01:47:06.729 --> 01:47:10.291]  It is the most murderous criminal organization the world's ever seen.
[01:47:10.891 --> 01:47:16.193]  Imagine being in a coma and waking up in this, in this world after, you know, a 10-year or 15-year coma.
[01:47:16.213 --> 01:47:17.694]  You wouldn't, you wouldn't even believe it.
[01:47:18.234 --> 01:47:20.195]  You'd think aliens came and conquered the Earth.
[01:47:21.756 --> 01:47:24.777]  Some sort of weird extra-dimensional demonic alien force.
[01:47:26.758 --> 01:47:30.060]  And then you look at the people carrying this out, Boris Johnson looks like a...
[01:47:31.198 --> 01:47:34.340]  Child molester, I'm not saying he's a child molester, I'm saying he looks like one.
[01:47:34.800 --> 01:47:35.760]  Brian Stelter.
[01:47:36.301 --> 01:47:42.464]  All these people just look like total buffoon idiots, reanimated dead hogs.
[01:47:43.345 --> 01:47:47.890]  The inversion of reality is really something else.
[01:47:47.930 --> 01:47:51.374]  They said Nazis for four years, now they're telling you they want to check your papers.
[01:47:51.775 --> 01:47:57.581]  Now they go to $50,000 a plate dinners, fly on private jets, then say tax the rich.
[01:47:57.662 --> 01:47:58.743]  What the hell does that mean?
[01:47:58.823 --> 01:48:01.226]  Honestly, it's not even irony.
[01:48:01.266 --> 01:48:02.347]  It's just hilarious.
[01:48:03.348 --> 01:48:04.109]  I don't even know.
[01:48:04.129 --> 01:48:05.110]  She's rubbing it in your face.
[01:48:05.190 --> 01:48:09.074]  AOC, whose real name is Sandy, now that's actually come out.
[01:48:09.094 --> 01:48:10.255]  All of her friends call her Sandy.
[01:48:10.275 --> 01:48:10.916]  They followed her around.
[01:48:10.936 --> 01:48:11.837]  Everybody calls her Sandy.
[01:48:12.157 --> 01:48:14.519]  It's just this Democrat thing with the acronyms.
[01:48:14.820 --> 01:48:18.283]  But her boyfriend is worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:48:18.543 --> 01:48:21.827]  The people she hangs out with are all billionaires that skip taxes, by the way.
[01:48:22.307 --> 01:48:23.748]  They don't even pay their taxes, Alex!
[01:48:23.768 --> 01:48:24.889]  They don't wear a mask either.
[01:48:24.969 --> 01:48:26.530]  They don't take the shots they tell us to.
[01:48:26.910 --> 01:48:29.152]  We're gonna come back and... I'm gonna... Let's just write notes.
[01:48:29.192 --> 01:48:29.972]  Let's play the speech.
[01:48:30.452 --> 01:48:32.134]  And then let's respond to it.
[01:48:32.574 --> 01:48:33.254]  It's horrible.
[01:48:33.394 --> 01:48:34.395]  It's what you knew would happen.
[01:48:34.955 --> 01:48:36.536]  I mean, it's just... It's insane.
[01:48:36.576 --> 01:48:37.837]  But don't let them demoralize you.
[01:48:38.097 --> 01:48:38.798]  They're gonna lose.
[01:48:39.298 --> 01:48:41.800]  Alright, James O'Keefe is now scheduled next segment.
[01:48:42.500 --> 01:48:44.862]  We had one of his big whistleblowers on last hour.
[01:48:44.882 --> 01:48:47.123]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:48:47.163 --> 01:48:49.105]  I mean, it's hard to watch this Biden clip.
[01:48:50.060 --> 01:48:56.485]  And we already pled him saying we're run by China, they own us, it's over, that we've mortgaged ourselves to them, meaning our elites have sold us out.
[01:48:57.566 --> 01:49:06.394]  That's basically in the Wall Street Journal again, saying how pure and great he is as a communist, he'll teach us how to live, and Xi pushes malice vision is the name of the article.
[01:49:07.443 --> 01:49:08.404]  Here it is on your TV viewer.
[01:49:08.444 --> 01:49:08.965]  I'll show it to you.
[01:49:09.005 --> 01:49:09.365]  It's unbelievable.
[01:49:09.385 --> 01:49:12.669]  You've got to read the whole article I did this morning just to get an idea about this.
[01:49:12.749 --> 01:49:15.393]  But it made Xi mad when they censored Trump.
[01:49:15.773 --> 01:49:17.916]  So he thinks the globalists are a little too big for their britches.
[01:49:17.936 --> 01:49:21.059]  So now he's arresting some of their people and taking over their companies.
[01:49:21.500 --> 01:49:26.185]  It just shows how they're busy getting rid of due process in America and henpecking us because we're domesticated.
[01:49:26.886 --> 01:49:29.748]  And then the dictators just slap him around, Alan.
[01:49:30.169 --> 01:49:35.132]  And the globalists just roll over and Mark Zuckerberg pees himself and asks, G.G.
[01:49:35.172 --> 01:49:36.553]  Pink, can I name my daughter after you?
[01:49:36.573 --> 01:49:37.194]  And he said, no.
[01:49:38.014 --> 01:49:39.816]  He goes, oh, sir!
[01:49:40.056 --> 01:49:52.145]  Think about, too, now, after the fallout of Afghanistan, China, of course, moving right in, just ready to move right in there, get those resources and continue their monopoly on, it's like, 98% of the world's rare minerals.
[01:49:55.074 --> 01:50:00.137]  And now the guy, you guys actually found the digital version of the Washington Post article from this weekend.
[01:50:00.157 --> 01:50:00.697]  Yeah, there it is.
[01:50:01.117 --> 01:50:01.978]  People gotta read this article.
[01:50:02.258 --> 01:50:04.339]  Xi Jinping aims to reign in Chinese capitalism.
[01:50:06.293 --> 01:50:11.493]   support of Mao's socialist vision and that's what they've done here. So let's
[01:50:11.493 --> 01:50:15.052]   let's let's hear I mean to me it's even surreal I know this was all coming but
[01:50:15.052 --> 01:50:18.293]   you talk about them getting us used to it here is the puppet that stole the
[01:50:18.293 --> 01:50:23.293]   election has no support telling us all these lies and pushing agenda 2030 in
[01:50:23.293 --> 01:50:28.242]  our face at the UN let's just play it and listen to it.
[01:50:28.242 --> 01:50:33.693]   Ladies and gentlemen this is the clear and urgent choice that we face here at
[01:50:33.693 --> 01:50:39.613]   the dawning of what must be a decisive decade for our world.
[01:50:39.577 --> 01:50:42.858]  A decade that will quite literally determine our futures.
[01:50:44.279 --> 01:50:56.384]  As a global community, we're challenged by urgent and looming crises wherein lie enormous opportunities if, if we can summon the will and resolve to seize these opportunities.
[01:50:57.674 --> 01:51:09.257]  Will we work together to save lives, defeat COVID-19 everywhere, and take the necessary steps to prepare ourselves for the next pandemic, for there will be another one?
[01:51:10.117 --> 01:51:17.479]  Or will we fail to harness the tools at our disposal as the more virulent and dangerous variants take hold?
[01:51:18.479 --> 01:51:23.520]  Will we meet the threat of challenging climate, the challenging climate we're all feeling?
[01:51:23.540 --> 01:51:24.480]  I'm sorry, just stop it.
[01:51:24.540 --> 01:51:25.981]  I have to say something and I want you to.
[01:51:26.061 --> 01:51:26.961]  Just back it up 10 seconds.
[01:51:28.285 --> 01:51:37.170]  Remember, 15 days to flatten the curve, two months wear a mask, 18 months, well, it's permanent, get used to it, but take the vaccine, you don't have to wear a mask.
[01:51:37.251 --> 01:51:38.631]  Okay, you took the vaccine, you gotta wear a mask.
[01:51:39.052 --> 01:51:42.474]  Okay, just take the vaccine, you don't have to be tested to go to college every day or work.
[01:51:42.614 --> 01:51:45.195]  Oh, now, even if you've had the shots, you gotta take more shots.
[01:51:45.816 --> 01:51:48.658]  Johnson & Johnson says every two months, the others say the same thing now.
[01:51:49.298 --> 01:51:52.260]  Oh, and you still gotta be tested even if you've had the shots.
[01:51:52.340 --> 01:51:53.781]  I mean, it's a trap!
[01:51:54.361 --> 01:51:55.162]  It's a scam!
[01:51:55.982 --> 01:52:12.156]  It's like you're like a pizza delivery guy and you go to somebody's door and they go, step in here for me and they hit you in the back of the head with a club and you wake up and you're chained up and somehow you get out of it and they go, come back, I won't hit you in the head with a club again and you come back and they hit you again and next you're tied down to a table and they're getting ready to eat you.
[01:52:12.176 --> 01:52:17.360]  I mean, it's just ridiculous to see the public is so lemming-like and they're in a trance.
[01:52:17.400 --> 01:52:19.062]  They can't believe they're being abused.
[01:52:19.362 --> 01:52:21.104]  They can't believe they're being attacked, Owen.
[01:52:21.923 --> 01:52:28.510]  Well, there's an easy way to illustrate the control, the manipulation, the slavery that Biden is proposing here.
[01:52:28.530 --> 01:52:29.812]  You can just ask a simple question.
[01:52:29.892 --> 01:52:31.374]  Alex, just humor me here.
[01:52:32.295 --> 01:52:34.537]  Alex, do you want to live in fear of a virus?
[01:52:35.138 --> 01:52:35.278]  No.
[01:52:35.778 --> 01:52:36.099]  Okay.
[01:52:36.719 --> 01:52:38.181]  Well, sorry, you have no choice, actually.
[01:52:38.321 --> 01:52:39.302]  You're going to have to live in fear.
[01:52:39.543 --> 01:52:42.926]  Do you want to live in fear that the weather is going to kill everybody?
[01:52:43.866 --> 01:52:44.146]  Uh, no.
[01:52:44.566 --> 01:52:44.966]  Oh, sorry.
[01:52:44.986 --> 01:52:45.867]  Well, you have no choice.
[01:52:45.947 --> 01:52:47.807]  So you're going to have to live in fear the rest of your life.
[01:52:48.447 --> 01:52:53.888]  And, uh, well, if you don't want to live in that fear, we're going to give you a nice little cell to live in.
[01:52:54.329 --> 01:52:58.830]  And it'll be about four by four and you can be nice and safe in there because you're a danger to the world now.
[01:52:59.250 --> 01:53:02.831]  We've declared you a threat to the world because you're not afraid of a virus and you're not afraid of the weather.
[01:53:03.431 --> 01:53:06.011]  And so, well, now you're just a prisoner, you see?
[01:53:06.031 --> 01:53:06.712]  Well, that's it.
[01:53:06.772 --> 01:53:08.272]  And all they do is tell us.
[01:53:09.943 --> 01:53:12.505]  That just do what we say and it'll go back to normal.
[01:53:12.525 --> 01:53:14.807]  So people go, okay, I'll give my kids shots to play sports.
[01:53:15.227 --> 01:53:15.948]  Okay, I'll take it.
[01:53:15.968 --> 01:53:17.509]  And then you have a heart attack and you go, whoa!
[01:53:17.890 --> 01:53:19.411]  And then suddenly nobody will talk to you.
[01:53:19.491 --> 01:53:23.554]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, how do they used to get every culture to commit human sacrifice?
[01:53:24.135 --> 01:53:25.656]  Why would they do that as an exercise of power?
[01:53:25.996 --> 01:53:30.340]  And the same type of cults are in control and are literally having us sacrifice our children.
[01:53:30.640 --> 01:53:32.561]  It's the psychology that most people can't understand.
[01:53:32.601 --> 01:53:36.942]  I know we've got to get back to Biden, but Alex, the world elite look at the planet as theirs.
[01:53:37.302 --> 01:53:42.203]  They don't want you to take their oxygen, their water, their food, their land.
[01:53:42.403 --> 01:53:43.323]  It's theirs!
[01:53:43.703 --> 01:53:45.284]  That's what Prince Philip said, and they love him.
[01:53:45.324 --> 01:53:47.084]  He said they're a bunch of useless eaters who need to be culled.
[01:53:47.464 --> 01:53:53.846]  And you're now in the culling process, and our audience is the best hope we've got to fight this and stop it, and that's why you're so important.
[01:53:54.206 --> 01:53:57.047]  Back to the reanimated corpse puppet they put into power.
[01:53:57.087 --> 01:53:57.387]  Here it is.
[01:53:58.168 --> 01:54:01.120]  As the more virulent and dangerous variants take hold.
[01:54:02.104 --> 01:54:03.108]  Will we meet the threat?
[01:54:05.506 --> 01:54:07.767]  As the more virulent and deadly versions take hold.
[01:54:07.827 --> 01:54:08.567]  It takes hold!
[01:54:08.987 --> 01:54:10.388]  See, they're taking hold!
[01:54:11.209 --> 01:54:13.270]  Oh, you took the shop and now it's worse!
[01:54:13.530 --> 01:54:14.710]  I mean, come on, people!
[01:54:14.950 --> 01:54:20.653]  You don't go have somebody fix your car because you had a popped tire and then now your engine blows up when you leave.
[01:54:20.933 --> 01:54:22.754]  You take it back and now something else breaks.
[01:54:22.954 --> 01:54:26.196]  They're breaking the equipment on the car to keep you under their control.
[01:54:26.596 --> 01:54:27.837]  Go back to this piece of filth.
[01:54:27.877 --> 01:54:28.597]  Just go back to him.
[01:54:29.838 --> 01:54:39.547]  Will we meet the threat of the challenging climate we're all feeling, already ravaging every part of our world with extreme weather?
[01:54:40.888 --> 01:54:53.476]   Or will we suffer the merciless march of ever-worsening droughts and floods, more intense fires and hurricanes, longer heat waves, None of that's true.
[01:54:53.476 --> 01:54:55.476]  Sorry, back it up.
[01:54:55.476 --> 01:54:57.476]  It's in the stack of articles I read this morning.
[01:54:57.476 --> 01:55:04.976]   Guys, pull it up. Biden's creating a new agency, a department in an agency, to fight the warm weather and to
[01:55:04.976 --> 01:55:07.476]  teach people how to survive in the growing heat.
[01:55:07.587 --> 01:55:09.208]  And statistically, we're not getting hotter.
[01:55:09.268 --> 01:55:09.949]  It's all a lie.
[01:55:10.229 --> 01:55:11.329]  But it just doesn't matter.
[01:55:11.349 --> 01:55:17.073]  I mean, I remember in the 1980s, in two days, when I was in middle school and stuff, when it was 115 degrees in Dallas.
[01:55:17.093 --> 01:55:18.074]  It ain't been 115 since then.
[01:55:18.094 --> 01:55:19.435]  It's BS, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:55:23.097 --> 01:55:25.719]  Yeah, we just had the record cold and snowfall here in Austin.
[01:55:26.039 --> 01:55:31.463]  He might as well be giving a speech warning you that Martians are invading from Mars and the Plutonians.
[01:55:31.483 --> 01:55:32.463]  Well, the world ends in 2030.
[01:55:32.503 --> 01:55:34.284]  That's because they plan to kill everybody by then.
[01:55:35.105 --> 01:55:36.486]  You understand, folks?
[01:55:36.526 --> 01:55:39.508]  They say by 2030, they want to reduce the majority of the population.
[01:55:39.688 --> 01:55:43.611]  And they're getting started with a weak virus, and it's going to get stronger.
[01:55:43.631 --> 01:55:46.212]  You heard more deadly variants are going to take hold.
[01:55:46.452 --> 01:55:47.413]  They're going to take hold in you.
[01:55:47.433 --> 01:55:48.434]  They're going to kill you.
[01:55:48.774 --> 01:55:49.334]  They made it.
[01:55:49.434 --> 01:55:50.295]  They're going to release it.
[01:55:50.515 --> 01:55:56.078]  That's why he said decisive decade, because this is the decade where the globalists make their global culling of the population.
[01:55:56.258 --> 01:56:05.704]  But there'd be just as much reality if he was up there telling you plutonians were coming, and eight-headed monsters from Saturn's eighth moon are coming to eat you.
[01:56:05.944 --> 01:56:08.726]  There'd be just as much reality in that as there is in what he's just said.
[01:56:09.206 --> 01:56:10.587]  And here's the key to all this.
[01:56:11.806 --> 01:56:16.028]  What we need to do is, I guarantee you, they've got cures.
[01:56:16.268 --> 01:56:18.149]  They've got real vaccines for what they've released.
[01:56:18.769 --> 01:56:22.130]  And so we need people inside the Wuhan lab, inside the Chapel Hill labs.
[01:56:22.691 --> 01:56:30.314]   We need a long-term infiltration program just like Just like Dr. Boyle did to get into that special Harvard Ph.D.
[01:56:30.334 --> 01:56:31.014]  They give one a year.
[01:56:31.034 --> 01:56:32.035]  He got the Kissinger Ph.D.
[01:56:32.075 --> 01:56:35.716]  about world government enslaving everybody, how the plan is to set up world government and kill everybody.
[01:56:36.016 --> 01:56:36.756]  That's how he knows about it.
[01:56:36.776 --> 01:56:37.657]  He has that Ph.D.
[01:56:37.697 --> 01:56:38.077]  on record.
[01:56:38.617 --> 01:56:39.737]  That's why he was the head of the U.N.
[01:56:39.757 --> 01:56:41.638]  He had a prosecutor and the rest of it wrote the U.S.
[01:56:41.658 --> 01:56:43.259]  laws on bioweapons and chemical weapons.
[01:56:44.219 --> 01:56:50.441]  But he spent a lot of time to be the smartest guy, highest in his class, to get into that and the other elite schools.
[01:56:51.001 --> 01:56:57.224]   But all we need is people, whether you live on a golf course next to some of these people or anywhere, This is a war.
[01:56:57.264 --> 01:56:59.145]  You're going to have to be an intelligence operative for God.
[01:56:59.565 --> 01:57:01.666]  And you're going to have to infiltrate and find out what's going on.
[01:57:01.686 --> 01:57:04.347]  Don't break the law or anything, but they've all got real vaccines.
[01:57:04.367 --> 01:57:05.888]  They've all got real, all this stuff.
[01:57:06.168 --> 01:57:08.889]  That's what's going to be obvious is when they're killing.
[01:57:08.909 --> 01:57:10.730]  I mean, folks, they're going to kill everybody.
[01:57:11.110 --> 01:57:14.292]  I mean, most people listening are going to be dead in like five, 10 years if this continues.
[01:57:14.312 --> 01:57:15.532]  I mean, I'm not trying to scare you.
[01:57:15.552 --> 01:57:18.173]  I'm just saying, I mean, this is, they're coming to kill everybody.
[01:57:18.193 --> 01:57:18.774]  You figured it out yet?
[01:57:19.634 --> 01:57:25.979]  Well, who do you think you're dealing with that make viruses in a lab that's run by the Chinese military?
[01:57:25.999 --> 01:57:27.381]  A hundred times worse than this one.
[01:57:27.621 --> 01:57:30.243]  And they intentionally do spillover research.
[01:57:30.263 --> 01:57:33.546]  It's all in the documents so that they can get an animal virus transmittable to humans.
[01:57:33.846 --> 01:57:37.149]  They do gain-of-function research so that it's more communicable.
[01:57:37.669 --> 01:57:38.470]  Who does that?
[01:57:39.050 --> 01:57:40.091]  Who does that, Alex?
[01:57:40.552 --> 01:57:41.753]  Do you have any desire to do that?
[01:57:42.173 --> 01:57:43.154]  Well, it's illegal.
[01:57:43.674 --> 01:57:44.975]  And then he lied to Congress.
[01:57:45.355 --> 01:57:50.679]  And you know, Fauci looks like he's a deflated little turnip now.
[01:57:50.760 --> 01:57:52.501]  He doesn't look so arrogant now, does he, Owen?
[01:57:52.561 --> 01:57:53.902]  But see, here's the thing, Alex.
[01:57:53.922 --> 01:57:58.846]  The whole thing is a false flag because what they're going to do is, I mean, because they always like to show their hand.
[01:57:58.886 --> 01:57:59.946]  Maybe Biden's being serious.
[01:57:59.986 --> 01:58:02.748]  I guess they are going to release a new dangerous variant.
[01:58:02.769 --> 01:58:04.009]  What do you think Delta is?
[01:58:04.230 --> 01:58:04.930]  They released it.
[01:58:05.270 --> 01:58:07.192]  They sprayed it on Texas.
[01:58:07.532 --> 01:58:15.663]  And then, but if they really release something that's like, you know, 50% you're gonna die if you get it, then they'll just blame all the unvaccinated and that'll be the excuse to mop us all up?
[01:58:15.883 --> 01:58:17.966]  Look, it's a thousand data points that tell me this.
[01:58:18.006 --> 01:58:20.730]  They hit Florida and Texas four months ago with a bioweapon.
[01:58:21.121 --> 01:58:23.582]  All right, James O'Keefe is joining us here in a minute or two.
[01:58:24.043 --> 01:58:28.645]  Owen Schroer is riding shotgun with me, host of The War Room, weekdays, 3 p.m.
[01:58:28.705 --> 01:58:29.065]  Central.
[01:58:29.085 --> 01:58:34.949]  Let me tell you some of the other articles that are up on InfoWars.com right now that only get out to people if you share them.
[01:58:34.969 --> 01:58:35.729]  That's the whole war.
[01:58:36.129 --> 01:58:37.190]  When you take action, we win.
[01:58:37.210 --> 01:58:38.010]  If you don't, we're done.
[01:58:38.791 --> 01:58:46.515]  Obama Defense Secretary Leon Panetta admits he was involved with General Milley's secret CCP calls.
[01:58:46.534 --> 01:58:49.373]  What did I say two weeks ago, or a week and a half ago?
[01:58:49.373 --> 01:58:51.413]  I said this is being run by Obama.
[01:58:51.413 --> 01:58:53.095]  It's his whole former administration.
[01:58:53.095 --> 01:58:57.814]   And now they're bragging about the tyranny and lying and saying Trump tried to overthrow the
[01:58:57.814 --> 01:59:00.213]   government with no proof, and then calling a foreign power
[01:59:00.213 --> 01:59:02.675]  and saying, "Don't worry, we've taken control of the nukes."
[01:59:02.675 --> 01:59:06.454]   This is conditioning us to learn that there are stay-behind networks that run things,
[01:59:06.454 --> 01:59:08.733]  even in case we get a good president elected.
[01:59:08.733 --> 01:59:11.934]   I mean, this is just, again, trampling us, training us to be slaves.
[01:59:11.993 --> 01:59:15.353]  Big breaking news on InfoWars.com from Patrick Howley of National File.
[01:59:15.754 --> 01:59:22.055]  County clerk submits report that Colorado Secretary of State and Dominion destroyed election data.
[01:59:22.135 --> 01:59:23.975]  Very, very powerful info coming out.
[01:59:24.676 --> 01:59:25.836]  And the list goes on and on.
[01:59:25.856 --> 01:59:29.817]  Another big article on InfoWars.com from Mises.org.
[01:59:30.017 --> 01:59:30.737]  Very important.
[01:59:30.777 --> 01:59:35.298]  Why natural immunity is a political problem for the regime and for the UN and all of them.
[01:59:36.636 --> 01:59:39.160]  Natural immunity isn't the problem, it's the target.
[01:59:39.200 --> 01:59:41.904]  It's what the mRNA erases is your natural immunity.
[01:59:41.944 --> 01:59:43.967]  That's the domestication processes.
[01:59:44.547 --> 01:59:47.452]  And saying the president put in your body what they want, when they want.
[01:59:47.472 --> 01:59:49.074]  Before we get O'Keefe on here.
[01:59:50.091 --> 01:59:56.153]  Again, please spread the word about the broadcast, support our local Aminathem stations, and get great products that you and your family eat at the same time.
[01:59:56.493 --> 01:59:59.314]  Everybody needs storable food in this unstable world that lasts a long time.
[01:59:59.594 --> 02:00:01.735]  It's high quality at the lowest prices you're going to find for quality.
[02:00:02.155 --> 02:00:05.216]  Infowarrestore.com has the entire MyPatriot Supply Patriot Alliance.
[02:00:06.897 --> 02:00:14.100]  Catalog at the lowest prices you're gonna find, and then a small part of the funding comes out of that to us, the funder operation, InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:00:14.380 --> 02:00:19.783]  We have the new film that is going to officially start shipping in two weeks.
[02:00:20.143 --> 02:00:25.926]  Pre-order it on DVD and get a free copy of Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, if you pre-order it.
[02:00:26.466 --> 02:00:32.549]  That's gonna end once they officially start shipping, then it'll be some new deals that we're gonna have, but that's the best deal we're able to offer.
[02:00:32.589 --> 02:00:33.469]  It's an amazing deal.
[02:00:33.869 --> 02:00:37.310]   At InfoWarsTore.com, It's COVID Land, Part One.
[02:00:38.231 --> 02:00:41.031]  It is called The Lockdown, and it's $19.95.
[02:00:41.572 --> 02:00:44.652]  You get a free copy of Endgame with it at infowarestore.com.
[02:00:44.672 --> 02:00:47.053]  We've got the filmmakers on the broadcast tomorrow.
[02:00:47.373 --> 02:00:54.135]  Now, joining us is James O'Keefe at Project Veritas, always breaking huge news.
[02:00:54.215 --> 02:00:56.015]  And James O'Keefe joins us.
[02:00:56.035 --> 02:01:04.498]   We already had one of his amazing whistleblowers, Jody O'Malley from HHS, an MSM RN who was over management Well, thank you, Alex.
[02:01:04.318 --> 02:01:09.777]   or singularly recorded people admitting that a vaccine is causing a large portion of the illnesses
[02:01:09.777 --> 02:01:11.057]  and even deaths.
[02:01:11.057 --> 02:01:15.497]   And joining us to talk about this is James O'Keefe, Owen Schroeder, riding shotgun.
[02:01:15.497 --> 02:01:18.257]  James, I know this is part one, tell us about it.
[02:01:18.257 --> 02:01:20.537]   People that haven't seen it, everybody should share it right now.
[02:01:20.537 --> 02:01:23.818]   It got censored off the web last night, which is just incredible.
[02:01:23.818 --> 02:01:26.356]  And then part two, give us an idea of what's coming.
[02:01:26.356 --> 02:01:28.497]  James, thanks for joining us.
[02:01:28.497 --> 02:01:29.738]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[02:01:29.738 --> 02:01:33.697]  Yeah, I mean, this video is blown up everywhere.
[02:01:34.401 --> 02:01:35.462]  You had Jody on.
[02:01:35.942 --> 02:01:36.602]  Whistleblower.
[02:01:37.222 --> 02:01:37.823]  Part one.
[02:01:38.223 --> 02:01:44.646]  This is a series of videotapes exposing what people inside the government and pharmaceutical companies are saying about the vaccine.
[02:01:44.746 --> 02:01:46.626]  So what you saw there was a federal employee.
[02:01:46.827 --> 02:01:48.247]  You heard her early on the program.
[02:01:49.148 --> 02:01:50.488]  The hospital has responded.
[02:01:51.008 --> 02:01:53.169]  HHS Hospital has now given a response, Alex.
[02:01:53.710 --> 02:01:56.551]  They say they're investigating what Jody has reported.
[02:01:56.971 --> 02:02:01.373]  And again, Jody exposing doctors saying the vaccine is full of, in their words, shit.
[02:02:01.977 --> 02:02:06.701]  And also saying that myocarditis and heart issues were not reported to the CDC.
[02:02:06.741 --> 02:02:08.903]  The CDC mandates that those things are reported.
[02:02:09.644 --> 02:02:12.967]  And Jodi recorded her colleagues saying they weren't reported.
[02:02:13.648 --> 02:02:20.374]  So there's a lot of people, Alex, like Jodi out there, thousands of people that are in her position, but she was the first one to effectively do this.
[02:02:20.454 --> 02:02:22.215]  No one's ever done what she's done before.
[02:02:22.856 --> 02:02:25.478]  So we have the next installment tomorrow.
[02:02:26.139 --> 02:02:30.666]   Hospital, Alex, has not denied What Jody has said.
[02:02:30.806 --> 02:02:32.147]  So in other words, the tapes are true.
[02:02:33.147 --> 02:02:36.328]  And because they're true, Instagram took it down.
[02:02:36.549 --> 02:02:38.029]  Facebook took it down.
[02:02:38.550 --> 02:02:39.890]  It's still up on YouTube.
[02:02:39.990 --> 02:02:43.492]  It's currently trending on Twitter even though I'm banned on Twitter.
[02:02:44.431 --> 02:02:46.091]  This is an extraordinary series of events.
[02:02:47.572 --> 02:02:51.653]  Things typically go this way when you get the damning footage because it's undeniable.
[02:02:51.913 --> 02:02:54.174]  Well, we need everybody to push this to the top of Twitter.
[02:02:54.194 --> 02:02:59.035]  So what is the hashtag or the term that's trending so we can get our audience to retweet it right now?
[02:02:59.135 --> 02:02:59.815]  You're not on Twitter.
[02:02:59.855 --> 02:03:00.375]  I'm not on Twitter.
[02:03:00.755 --> 02:03:03.276]  Owen's not there, but they're there for all of us.
[02:03:03.316 --> 02:03:04.416]  So listeners, go get this.
[02:03:04.656 --> 02:03:09.597]  Let's make it number one and save some lives so that more whistleblowers have the courage to come forward.
[02:03:09.998 --> 02:03:11.318]  What's the term we should all search?
[02:03:12.335 --> 02:03:17.318]  Yeah, it's... Eric, what's the... COVIDVaxExposed is the current hashtag.
[02:03:17.358 --> 02:03:20.380]  Hashtag COVIDVAXExposed.
[02:03:20.481 --> 02:03:22.082]  And the video is populating everywhere.
[02:03:22.122 --> 02:03:25.444]  You can go on my Telegram and, like, you and I talked about distribution by proxy.
[02:03:25.484 --> 02:03:27.846]  All you have to do is embed the video.
[02:03:27.906 --> 02:03:28.686]  Everyone's doing it.
[02:03:28.826 --> 02:03:30.247]  They can't get around the censorship.
[02:03:30.567 --> 02:03:32.128]  I'm sorry, the censorship is not stopping us.
[02:03:32.189 --> 02:03:33.449]  We're getting around the censorship.
[02:03:34.150 --> 02:03:41.495]  And, you know, and the great thing, again, is that we've elicited a response from the hospital and they have not denied what we've reported.
[02:03:42.262 --> 02:03:44.783]  So, a lot of people inspired by Jody's example.
[02:03:45.203 --> 02:03:46.143]  There it is on Twitter.
[02:03:46.803 --> 02:03:49.144]  If you look at those videos, people are embedding them everywhere.
[02:03:49.744 --> 02:03:52.325]  It's distribution by proxy, just like we talked about.
[02:03:52.585 --> 02:03:57.287]  Absolutely, and again, they wouldn't be trying to censor it if it wasn't exposing their narrative.
[02:03:57.327 --> 02:04:01.688]  I know you're not even anti-vaccine when they're good, clean, approved vaccines, but this is even a vaccine.
[02:04:02.228 --> 02:04:11.671]  The wheels are coming off, and as more whistleblowers come forward, I don't see how they're going to be able to cover this up, that this so-called shot is causing heart attacks, is causing COVID-like symptoms.
[02:04:12.674 --> 02:04:14.995]  Yeah, I mean, I don't take a position on the vaccine.
[02:04:15.015 --> 02:04:19.538]  I'm just giving the people who are in the government a platform to talk about it.
[02:04:19.558 --> 02:04:21.119]  I mean, this is not pretend.
[02:04:21.139 --> 02:04:22.460]  This is a real human being.
[02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:26.002]  And she's willing to give up her career and her livelihood.
[02:04:26.423 --> 02:04:29.344]  She saw her friend die and she cried about it.
[02:04:29.865 --> 02:04:32.266]  So I'm giving people an opportunity to speak.
[02:04:32.326 --> 02:04:38.350]  Tomorrow, you're going to hear from someone inside of another government agency.
[02:04:39.093 --> 02:04:48.279]  Talking about this and saying some pretty, if I, I'm not going to tell you what he said yet because we're still producing it, but if I told you Alex, it would evoke audible gasps from you.
[02:04:48.339 --> 02:04:49.300]  It's that shocking.
[02:04:49.880 --> 02:04:53.563]  So I don't think there's anything they can do to stop Project Veritas at this point.
[02:04:53.943 --> 02:04:59.627]  There's nothing that they can do to stop us because if they were to ban me at this point, people would just be more interested in what is coming out.
[02:05:00.027 --> 02:05:03.649]  So what I would encourage people to do is continue to blow up our, our tip line.
[02:05:03.689 --> 02:05:06.071]  It's VeritasTipsAndProtonMail.com.
[02:05:06.491 --> 02:05:10.333]  Download the cuts from our Telegram page and upload them everywhere.
[02:05:11.394 --> 02:05:16.137]  I don't think they want to take it off YouTube now because it's just going to help the story.
[02:05:16.157 --> 02:05:24.461]  They have to be very careful, Alex, about making this an international story by like removing me wholesale from YouTube and Instagram.
[02:05:24.962 --> 02:05:28.844]  So they're walking that line, censoring it a little bit, but not too much.
[02:05:29.821 --> 02:05:32.943]  Well, I gotta tell ya, this is the Achilles heel of this whole thing.
[02:05:33.003 --> 02:05:34.745]  It's going to be whistleblowers, people inside.
[02:05:34.765 --> 02:05:40.509]  And as you said, her friend was a nurse from the video I've seen, and she died after the shot.
[02:05:40.589 --> 02:05:43.312]  I mean, the question is, how far will you go to submit to this?
[02:05:43.352 --> 02:05:48.996]  Well, her friend died, and then she has the doctors and nurses, for those that haven't seen the video, admitting they know this is going on.
[02:05:49.016 --> 02:05:50.817]  And I've talked to medical doctors in Austin.
[02:05:50.837 --> 02:05:51.818]  I ought to put you in touch with them.
[02:05:52.118 --> 02:05:54.520]  They're leaving a husband and wife at the hospital they work at.
[02:05:55.941 --> 02:05:58.984]  Because they're telling him to cover up what's going on.
[02:05:59.004 --> 02:06:00.245]  So I'll have to get you in contact with them.
[02:06:00.265 --> 02:06:02.706]  They're telling him, you're not going to tell people it's this vaccine.
[02:06:02.746 --> 02:06:05.068]  I mean, I think this house of cards is coming down.
[02:06:05.108 --> 02:06:10.132]  As you know, this weekend, the FDA voted 16 to 2 to not give booster shots and to not give to kids.
[02:06:10.652 --> 02:06:11.853]  And Fauci said, we don't care.
[02:06:11.893 --> 02:06:12.694]  We're going ahead with it.
[02:06:12.734 --> 02:06:13.575]  I mean, this is crazy.
[02:06:15.956 --> 02:06:21.621]  Well, and the fact that they're not reporting things that they're supposed to report, that was one of the statements that struck me.
[02:06:21.641 --> 02:06:27.694]   Dr. Gonzalez, the ER doctor at the HHS clinic saying, They're covering it under the rug, the mat.
[02:06:27.734 --> 02:06:29.474]  They're not reporting it even though they're supposed to.
[02:06:29.494 --> 02:06:30.895]  We've heard a lot of messages from people.
[02:06:30.935 --> 02:06:32.295]  Why aren't they reporting these issues?
[02:06:32.775 --> 02:06:35.896]  And again, I'm not taking a position on the vaccine.
[02:06:35.916 --> 02:06:37.117]  I actually don't have one.
[02:06:37.597 --> 02:06:39.338]  My job is to tell people the truth.
[02:06:39.938 --> 02:06:41.858]  And sometimes the truth works both ways.
[02:06:42.439 --> 02:06:43.859]  It's not just one-sided.
[02:06:44.319 --> 02:06:46.800]  There may be problems here that people have a right to know about.
[02:06:47.830 --> 02:06:54.496]  There may be people in the pharmaceutical companies, Alex, that know things that they want to keep secret from the public, and the public needs to know this stuff.
[02:06:54.617 --> 02:06:55.117]  Exactly.
[02:06:55.157 --> 02:06:56.739]  A free country has transparency.
[02:06:56.779 --> 02:06:58.060]  Owen's got a quick question before he's got to go.
[02:06:58.561 --> 02:07:06.409]  James, how many of the whistleblowers that came to you attempted to go to other media outlets first and got rejected with this big story?
[02:07:08.334 --> 02:07:14.057]  I mean, there's no paradigm for them to release this story on any of the cable networks or anywhere.
[02:07:14.097 --> 02:07:15.858]  I mean, look at what's happening to us.
[02:07:15.878 --> 02:07:17.539]  We're getting banned off.
[02:07:17.939 --> 02:07:19.179]  It's being taken off Instagram.
[02:07:19.580 --> 02:07:21.341]  Yeah, they have one narrative.
[02:07:21.361 --> 02:07:22.121]  They're not journalists.
[02:07:22.141 --> 02:07:22.961]  They just report lies.
[02:07:23.121 --> 02:07:24.162]  They won't even talk to people like her.
[02:07:25.042 --> 02:07:29.905]  So Veritas and Infowars are people that report this are the only hope for this information to get out.
[02:07:31.243 --> 02:07:33.164]  Yeah, there's no place for people to go, Owen.
[02:07:33.585 --> 02:07:36.227]  This is what I've been saying for a long time with you guys.
[02:07:36.247 --> 02:07:38.529]  There's simply no other place for people to go.
[02:07:38.769 --> 02:07:40.890]  The only thing that these people fear is we the people.
[02:07:41.331 --> 02:07:43.652]  They don't fear the Congress.
[02:07:43.672 --> 02:07:45.214]  They don't fear anything.
[02:07:45.514 --> 02:07:47.976]  All they fear are the barbarians at the gates.
[02:07:48.576 --> 02:07:51.178]  The population effectively pushing back.
[02:07:51.839 --> 02:07:56.302]  My friend Laura Logan likes to say something which sounds pretty crazy, but I believe it's true.
[02:07:56.722 --> 02:08:00.025]  She effectively says that we're, as a country, we're at the gates of Auschwitz.
[02:08:00.817 --> 02:08:02.578]  And the coup has already happened.
[02:08:02.638 --> 02:08:06.920]  We're sort of being pushed into this Orwellian, apocalyptic dystopia.
[02:08:07.381 --> 02:08:10.442]  And the only thing that's going to stop us from entering those gates is we, the people.
[02:08:10.842 --> 02:08:13.344]  And people like Jodi, who's giving up her livelihood.
[02:08:13.364 --> 02:08:14.885]  There's thousands more like her, Alex.
[02:08:15.285 --> 02:08:16.606]  So stay tuned for tomorrow.
[02:08:16.626 --> 02:08:17.866]  I can't tell you exactly what it is.
[02:08:17.926 --> 02:08:18.647]  It's going to be huge.
[02:08:18.667 --> 02:08:19.747]  It's going to be sensational.
[02:08:20.168 --> 02:08:25.030]  It's going to get people to think in a way they've never thought before about what's going on in this country.
[02:08:25.070 --> 02:08:25.450]  That's right.
[02:08:25.510 --> 02:08:26.351]  We will succeed.
[02:08:26.391 --> 02:08:27.211]  We don't have a choice.
[02:08:27.251 --> 02:08:28.412]  ProjectVeritas.com.
[02:08:28.432 --> 02:08:29.172]  We'll cover it tomorrow.
[02:08:29.392 --> 02:08:30.113]  Thanks, James O'Keefe.
[02:08:31.442 --> 02:08:31.622]  Thank you.
[02:08:31.642 --> 02:08:33.903]  All right, we're going to come back, fourth hour.
[02:08:33.963 --> 02:08:36.623]  Paul Joseph Watson joins us, but I want to put some bookends on this.
[02:08:37.183 --> 02:08:38.484]  And I don't know if we have time to air it.
[02:08:38.524 --> 02:08:39.564]  If not, it's going to air on The War Room.
[02:08:39.584 --> 02:08:48.466]  Maybe I'll do a special report on it, because they had a great idea, some of the crew did, showing Trump's speech at the U.N.
[02:08:48.506 --> 02:08:52.207]  against the New World Order, juxtaposed with what Biden is saying.
[02:08:52.226 --> 02:08:54.827]  All right, I've been pretty wound up today.
[02:08:54.827 --> 02:08:58.506]   And I was up till like 1 in the morning last night when I drove back out of DC.
[02:08:58.506 --> 02:09:02.867]   When I drove, yeah, just go ahead and shut that off for me, thanks a lot.
[02:09:02.867 --> 02:09:03.867]  Start over.
[02:09:03.867 --> 02:09:08.186]   Anyways, I have been pretty hyped up, pretty wound up here today.
[02:09:08.186 --> 02:09:12.945]   And I got back from DC right in time for the show and I appreciate Owen doing a great job.
[02:09:12.945 --> 02:09:19.386]   But I'm gonna shoot some special reports today as well that deal with what Trump said and
[02:09:19.386 --> 02:09:21.226]  did that was so revolutionary and why it pissed him off.
[02:09:21.226 --> 02:09:27.146]   It was a great thing he did at the UN calling out the new world order every year versus
[02:09:27.146 --> 02:09:28.305]  what Biden's doing.
[02:09:28.299 --> 02:09:33.603]  We need to remind America of that and remind her by this is a takeover and more Republicans need to do what Trump's done.
[02:09:33.964 --> 02:09:34.965]  That's why they don't do it though.
[02:09:34.985 --> 02:09:38.568]  They know if you do what Trump did and called out the attack on America, they come after you, Owen.
[02:09:39.189 --> 02:09:45.257]  Or, you know, so many people refuse to want to share InfoWars links or come on InfoWars as guests because they know it's the same thing.
[02:09:45.798 --> 02:09:48.262]  Oh, I may be marked for censorship and I may be this.
[02:09:48.302 --> 02:09:52.268]  I know you were briefly discussing that on the Tim Pool podcast yesterday, which...
[02:09:53.203 --> 02:09:54.244]  You know, he's been through it too.
[02:09:54.284 --> 02:09:56.465]  He had you on, I guess it was like six months ago.
[02:09:56.525 --> 02:09:57.966]  They censored that podcast.
[02:09:57.986 --> 02:10:00.548]  He deleted some of it off of his YouTube channel so he could stay up.
[02:10:00.608 --> 02:10:01.969]  So, I get it, but that's fine.
[02:10:02.209 --> 02:10:03.030]  You'll have nothing.
[02:10:03.650 --> 02:10:09.455]  If you're afraid to share Alex Jones, or you're afraid to go on InfoWars, then you'll have nothing when it's all said and done.
[02:10:09.495 --> 02:10:11.416]  So, just enjoy riding off into the sunset.
[02:10:11.436 --> 02:10:14.078]  Because no one will support you when you get taken off.
[02:10:14.138 --> 02:10:15.839]  But I don't think that's going to happen, Alex.
[02:10:15.919 --> 02:10:26.444]  I think even the weakest people out there in media that still, deep down, love liberty, love life, want to be free and prosperous, eventually they're going to turn it on, and that'll be when the threshold is crossed.
[02:10:26.744 --> 02:10:32.146]  And I don't want to see a situation like we have in Australia, where I think a civil war is almost inevitable at this point.
[02:10:32.166 --> 02:10:33.807]  Man, like cop cars running people over?
[02:10:33.847 --> 02:10:35.107]  The cops are one of war.
[02:10:35.228 --> 02:10:35.848]  They are just...
[02:10:36.628 --> 02:10:41.871]  And again, that's what Klaus Schwab wants, but people need to know it's direct, it's a plan, it's by design.
[02:10:42.532 --> 02:10:44.633]  And tomorrow we got Tim Pool on the show.
[02:10:45.193 --> 02:10:46.594]  So look for Tim Pool.
[02:10:46.614 --> 02:10:50.657]  He doesn't do a lot of interviews, but he's going to be with us tomorrow.
[02:10:51.337 --> 02:10:52.938]  So that's going to be on 11 a.m.
[02:10:53.018 --> 02:10:53.859]  to 2 p.m.
[02:10:53.879 --> 02:10:54.239]  Central.
[02:10:54.579 --> 02:10:58.782]  The fourth hour, we usually have a guest host and it's Paul Joseph Watson on Tuesdays.
[02:10:58.822 --> 02:11:02.144]  Tuesday is Paul Joseph Watson of Summit.NewsTime.
[02:11:02.904 --> 02:11:17.814]   Owen, you hosted Yeah, and I will just say this.
[02:11:17.914 --> 02:11:27.080]  Tomorrow, programming note for the War Room, I've been tracking this story and Dr. Brian Artis was so key in helping me understand it even better yesterday here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:11:27.100 --> 02:11:32.283]  But basically, yet another example, we're going to have the legal representation of a woman who was killed in a hospital.
[02:11:32.643 --> 02:11:33.583]  She went in with COVID.
[02:11:33.603 --> 02:11:34.723]  She was treated like a prisoner.
[02:11:35.123 --> 02:11:37.824]  Multiple lawyers, multiple court orders.
[02:11:38.204 --> 02:11:39.844]  Give her ivermectin, release her.
[02:11:40.104 --> 02:11:41.024]  They just refused to do it.
[02:11:41.104 --> 02:11:41.985]  Now the woman's dead.
[02:11:42.425 --> 02:11:43.425]  So we've been tracking.
[02:11:43.485 --> 02:11:47.386]  I'm telling you, Alex, Dr. Brian Ardis is going to be back on The War Room with me next week.
[02:11:47.466 --> 02:11:48.186]  It's so key.
[02:11:48.466 --> 02:11:50.266]  He breaks it all down, man.
[02:11:50.346 --> 02:11:53.487]  It's everything we knew from being outside.
[02:11:53.507 --> 02:11:57.587]  I've had a bunch of other medical doctors on here say the same thing, and it's come out.
[02:11:57.927 --> 02:12:01.168]  The protocol they give, the COVID protocol, is a death sentence.
[02:12:01.448 --> 02:12:02.589]  You get treated like a prisoner.
[02:12:02.949 --> 02:12:04.350]  And this isn't even up for debate!
[02:12:04.410 --> 02:12:10.433]  I mean, even the people... That's why you couldn't visit the families at old folks' homes or hospitals, because they want to be able to carry out the execution.
[02:12:10.693 --> 02:12:16.376]  Even the people that don't want to look at the COVID reality in the face cannot argue.
[02:12:16.716 --> 02:12:18.057]  Where are the COVID deaths happening?
[02:12:18.077 --> 02:12:21.939]  And think about this, they killed the lady we had on earlier, Jodi O'Malley's friend, who was a nurse there.
[02:12:22.159 --> 02:12:23.460]  They wouldn't even give her ivermectin.
[02:12:24.501 --> 02:12:26.062]  Where do the COVID deaths happen, people?
[02:12:26.222 --> 02:12:27.804]  They're not happening in the homeless camps.
[02:12:28.004 --> 02:12:31.728]  They're not happening in these massive gatherings or protests or riots or rallies.
[02:12:31.828 --> 02:12:32.328]  Hospitals.
[02:12:32.368 --> 02:12:34.110]  They're not happening at UN meetings.
[02:12:34.370 --> 02:12:35.951]  They're not happening at ballgames.
[02:12:36.112 --> 02:12:37.473]  They're happening at one place.
[02:12:37.933 --> 02:12:38.514]  One place.
[02:12:38.914 --> 02:12:39.455]  Hospitals.
[02:12:39.895 --> 02:12:40.336]  One place.
[02:12:40.516 --> 02:12:40.957]  That's right.
[02:12:41.097 --> 02:12:42.258]  Owen Schroer, 3 p.m.
[02:12:42.298 --> 02:12:43.279]  weekdays, Central.
[02:12:43.700 --> 02:12:46.323]  Only way we get this message out, and you get it now, it's life and death.
[02:12:46.343 --> 02:12:47.124]  We weren't hyping this.
[02:12:47.144 --> 02:12:47.865]  We weren't lying.
[02:12:48.206 --> 02:12:48.906]  They had a U.N.
[02:12:48.946 --> 02:12:51.209]  world government plan, the Rockefellers, that set up the U.N.
[02:12:51.229 --> 02:12:52.671]  to do it, to literally kill us.
[02:12:52.731 --> 02:12:53.913]  It's Operation Lockstep.
[02:12:54.293 --> 02:12:54.573]  It's here.
[02:12:54.594 --> 02:12:56.316]  They're gonna release more deadly viruses soon.
[02:12:56.776 --> 02:12:57.856]  And no vaccine's going to help him.
[02:12:57.877 --> 02:12:59.197]  It's actually going to breed him and create him.
[02:12:59.557 --> 02:13:02.138]  So tell everybody to tune in now to Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:13:02.538 --> 02:13:03.479]  Share the live links.
[02:13:03.539 --> 02:13:05.159]  Take his tweet when he puts it out promoting it.
[02:13:05.499 --> 02:13:06.020]  Retweet it.
[02:13:06.200 --> 02:13:08.101]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:13:08.481 --> 02:13:13.323]  Band out video and get the film, COVID Land, The Lockdown, Part One.
[02:13:13.683 --> 02:13:18.905]  Very well produced, amazing director, Robert Kennedy Jr., Dr. Ted Penney, and dozens of other guests.
[02:13:19.325 --> 02:13:20.385]  I voiced the thing over.
[02:13:20.405 --> 02:13:22.086]  It's going to be shipping in two weeks.
[02:13:22.106 --> 02:13:24.087]  And if you pre-order, you get a free copy of Endgame.
[02:13:25.528 --> 02:13:28.930]  A $19 value with it free at infowarestore.com.

[02:13:36.635 --> 02:13:37.856]  And you're authorized to make copies.
[02:13:37.916 --> 02:13:38.956]  And get it out to people.
[02:13:38.976 --> 02:13:40.037]  And air it on local TV.
[02:13:40.317 --> 02:13:40.958]  It's free to air.
[02:13:40.998 --> 02:13:42.158]  Just warn people!
[02:13:42.378 --> 02:13:43.139]  Warn people!
[02:13:43.319 --> 02:13:43.839]  Wake up!
[02:13:43.840 --> 02:13:45.840]  Come out of your trash now!
[02:13:45.840 --> 02:14:11.840]   Transmitting worldwide, from the Summit.News studios in the United Kingdom,
[02:14:11.840 --> 02:14:15.840]  you are listening to Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:14:15.840 --> 02:14:18.418]  (upbeat music)
[02:14:19.388 --> 02:14:25.733]  The Summit News Hour, we're going to talk about the revolution, the rebellion, the revolt that's going on in Australia.
[02:14:25.833 --> 02:14:32.238]  Finally, people are tired of being told by their esteemed health authorities not to talk to their friends and neighbours.
[02:14:32.278 --> 02:14:39.882]   They're tired of seeing Joggers in parks arrested, thrown to the ground as they have cardiac arrests for not wearing a mask.
[02:14:41.383 --> 02:14:46.146]  They're sick to the back teeth of women, old women being arrested for sitting on park benches.
[02:14:46.206 --> 02:15:00.654]  They're sick to the back teeth of people being told to get off a beach because they're not wearing a mask while they're sat on the beach or they don't wear a mask from the walk to the beach to the bar because that's of course when we know Covid is prone to strike most.
[02:15:01.675 --> 02:15:15.822]   Just like when you go into a restaurant The virus takes a break when you sit down at the table to have a drink, but it's particularly potent in the 10-yard walk from the door of the restaurant to the table itself.
[02:15:15.902 --> 02:15:18.462]  Makes perfect sense, I'm sure you'll agree.
[02:15:18.482 --> 02:15:24.484]  We're going to get into that shortly, though, because I did a report on Australia a few hours ago.
[02:15:24.544 --> 02:15:26.304]  Let me know when we have that video ready.
[02:15:26.949 --> 02:15:31.973]  But there was a big article that came out in The Telegraph just about an hour ago.
[02:15:31.993 --> 02:15:40.199]  The headline is, Wuhan scientists plan to release coronaviruses into bat caves 18 months before the outbreak.
[02:15:40.259 --> 02:15:49.406]  And recall that the horseshoe bat that they claim this coronavirus originated in was not located in the Wuhan wet market.
[02:15:50.006 --> 02:15:56.739]   In fact, the nearest bats, which they claimed were naturally infected with this virus, We're 400 miles away.
[02:15:57.159 --> 02:16:03.105]  What wasn't 400 miles away from the source of the infection was the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
[02:16:03.165 --> 02:16:11.092]  But remember, we weren't allowed to talk about that or we'd be banned off social media and called dangerous conspiracy theorists for the best part of a year.
[02:16:12.113 --> 02:16:36.153]   As Peter Dajak, one of the prime engineers of this gain-of-function research in Wuhan, wrote emails to Dr Anthony Fauci thanking him for not allowing that dangerous conspiracy theory to circulate, as he was literally put over the board of Facebook's fact-checking department on the coronavirus, deciding what people can and can't say about it.
[02:16:37.234 --> 02:16:43.259]  So Wuhan scientists plan to release coronaviruses into cave bats 18 months before the outbreak.
[02:16:43.971 --> 02:16:54.836]  Remember the first confirmed case, although they later covered this up, of somebody falling sick from the coronavirus was a lab worker in the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
[02:16:54.876 --> 02:16:56.116]  Just another coincidence.
[02:16:56.656 --> 02:17:10.362]  Wuhan scientists were planning to release enhanced airborne coronaviruses into Chinese bat populations to inoculate them against diseases that could jump to humans, leaked grant proposals dating from 2018 show.
[02:17:11.383 --> 02:17:20.790]   And again, remember, These caves where the nearest bats came from that were the source of the coronavirus, we're told, were 400 miles away from Wuhan itself.
[02:17:21.570 --> 02:17:37.616]  New documents show that just 18 months before the first COVID-19 cases appeared, researchers had submitted plans to release skin-penetrating nanoparticles containing novel chimeric spike proteins of bat coronaviruses into cave bats in Yunnan, China.
[02:17:39.037 --> 02:17:45.547]   They also plan to create chimeric viruses Genetically enhanced to infect humans more easily.
[02:17:45.607 --> 02:17:53.931]  Remember, this was a dangerous conspiracy theory just six months ago, and requested $14 million from DARPA to fund the work.
[02:17:54.411 --> 02:18:00.454]  And even DARPA came back and said, no, this is ridiculous, it's deadly, it's dangerous, we're not going to fund it.
[02:18:00.794 --> 02:18:03.375]  Even the deep state said it was too dangerous.
[02:18:04.335 --> 02:18:16.123]  Papers confirmed as genuine by a former member of the Trump administration show they were hoping to introduce human-specific cleavage sites to bat coronaviruses, which would make it easier for the virus to enter human cells.
[02:18:16.183 --> 02:18:20.026]  But again, they were trying to prevent that by making it happen.
[02:18:20.766 --> 02:18:32.394]  When COVID-19 was first genetically sequenced, scientists were puzzled about how the virus had evolved such a human-specific adaptation at the cleavage site on the spike protein, which is the reason it's so infectious.
[02:18:33.368 --> 02:18:38.232]  Documents released by DRASTIC, the web-based investigations team set up by scientists from across the world.
[02:18:38.332 --> 02:18:40.754]  So this is from the esteemed scientists themselves.
[02:18:42.455 --> 02:18:59.648]  Then it goes on to say that the bid was submitted by British zoologist Peter Dajak of EcoHealth Alliance, the organization that funded, with Dr. Anthony Fauci, gain-of-function research on behalf of the US government at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
[02:18:59.668 --> 02:19:13.639]   And again, as I said earlier, Dajak was Made kingmaker by Facebook fact-checkers to censor, quote, disinformation about the COVID outbreak right at the start of the pandemic back in February 2020.
[02:19:14.079 --> 02:19:30.653]  Then it goes on to include team members, Dr. Shi Zhengli, the WIV researcher dubbed Batwoman, as well as US researchers from the University of North Carolina and the United States Geological Survey National Wildlife Health Center.
[02:19:32.819 --> 02:19:35.680]  So again, Dajak, this guy, again, was intimately involved.
[02:19:35.720 --> 02:19:52.527]  The same guy who, back in February 2020, was writing gracious, indebted emails to Dr. Anthony Fauci, thanking him for cutting off the narrative at the source that the Wuhan Institute of Virology that he was funding had anything to do with the outbreak.
[02:19:53.007 --> 02:20:05.251]   Meanwhile, they're literally infecting these bats with the coronavirus in these caves in Yunnan, China, or at least applying for the Research permit to do so back in 2018.
[02:20:06.232 --> 02:20:14.999]  But even DARPA refused to fund the work, saying, quote, it's clear the proposed project, led by Peter Daszak, could have put local communities at risk.
[02:20:15.900 --> 02:20:24.427]  And warned that the team had not properly considered the dangers of enhancing the virus, gain-of-function research, or releasing a vaccine by air.
[02:20:24.867 --> 02:20:38.001]   Grant documents show the team also had some concerns about the vaccine program, said they would, quote, conduct educational outreach So that there is a public understanding of what we're doing and why we're doing it, particularly because of the practice of bat consumption in the region.
[02:20:38.741 --> 02:20:45.562]  Now again, if you talked about any of this six months ago, you were banned off of social media and they're still doing it to this day.
[02:20:47.463 --> 02:20:53.804]  Reclaim the Net reports Michigan candidate for governor, Garrett Soledano, receives permanent ban from YouTube.
[02:20:53.924 --> 02:20:54.224]  Why?
[02:20:54.364 --> 02:21:02.547]   Well, he challenged Governor Whitmer's COVID restrictions in Michigan One too many times, now he's permanently banned forever.
[02:21:02.707 --> 02:21:05.909]  Again, more election interference by Google.
[02:21:06.910 --> 02:21:11.973]  The Republican gubernatorial candidate in Michigan claims to have been permanently banned from YouTube.
[02:21:12.233 --> 02:21:21.959]  Garrett Soldano, an anti-lockdown activist who hopes to be the Republican Party's flag bearer for the Michigan governor race next year, was banned by YouTube yesterday.
[02:21:21.999 --> 02:21:31.165]   The notice from the Google-owned platform said his channel was suspended for severe or repeated violations of the community guidelines But did not specify exactly what they were.
[02:21:31.765 --> 02:21:34.528]  He was challenging the lockdown restrictions in Michigan.
[02:21:34.608 --> 02:21:35.849]  That's why he was banned.
[02:21:37.170 --> 02:21:43.416]  Meanwhile, Facebook and Instagram delete Project Veritas vaccine video for misinformation that could cause harm.
[02:21:43.996 --> 02:21:45.458]  What was the misinformation?
[02:21:45.518 --> 02:21:47.780]  It was a Health and Human Services official.
[02:21:48.573 --> 02:21:51.274]  Talking about vaccine side effects.
[02:21:51.394 --> 02:21:55.455]  Literally one of their own scientists talk about it and it's gone.
[02:21:55.675 --> 02:21:56.275]  It's banned.
[02:21:56.335 --> 02:21:57.035]  It's zapped.
[02:21:57.575 --> 02:22:00.576]  Facebook and its subsidiary Instagram have removed a new video.
[02:22:00.996 --> 02:22:05.437]  By the way, of course, O'Keefe and Project Veritas were banned off of Twitter many months ago.
[02:22:05.497 --> 02:22:07.737]  They're being banned off all these other platforms now.
[02:22:09.498 --> 02:22:14.959]  And Instagram's removed the video from the undercover reporting operatives under its misinformation policy.
[02:22:16.030 --> 02:22:19.412]  Says, we encourage free expression, but we don't allow false information.
[02:22:19.472 --> 02:22:20.773]  What was the false information?
[02:22:20.813 --> 02:22:37.504]  Well, they didn't tell Project Veritas, but the video in question featured a whistleblower from the Health and Human Services Department, registered nurse Jody O'Malley, making allegations that the federal government were underreporting the side effects of the COVID-19 vaccines.
[02:22:37.564 --> 02:22:43.107]   Now, the latest numbers Show that there have been at least 15,000 deaths as a result of the vaccine.
[02:22:43.747 --> 02:22:46.609]  Of course, that's an underreporting in and of itself.
[02:22:46.649 --> 02:22:53.794]  But if you talk about that, if you have a HHS registered nurse talk about it, then you get banned off of Facebook.
[02:22:54.734 --> 02:23:06.282]  Because again, the people tasked with running the fact checks on Facebook, on Instagram, were the very same people running the Wuhan Institute of Virology cover-up from the very beginning.
[02:23:06.934 --> 02:23:16.543]  The video O'Malley was discussing with another doctor, an ER doctor, alleging that not all patients suffering from heart inflammation after taking the vaccine are being reported.
[02:23:17.084 --> 02:23:24.791]  Quote, but now they, the government, are not going to blame the vaccine, Dr Gonzales said, of a patient who had suspected myocarditis.
[02:23:24.831 --> 02:23:26.193]  Of course, we've seen this in the UK.
[02:23:27.259 --> 02:23:41.072]  With the teenagers suffering from heart complications way more so than being hospitalised from the virus, from the Covid virus itself, and yet now we're rolling out jabs to kids as young as five years old.
[02:23:41.132 --> 02:23:42.493]  The insanity continues.
[02:23:42.573 --> 02:23:43.814]  Summit.News will be back.
[02:23:44.054 --> 02:23:44.515]  Don't go away.
[02:23:45.075 --> 02:23:52.121]  Well, many people have been asking of Australians over the past six months, where is their backbone?
[02:23:52.162 --> 02:23:57.326]  What happened to the rugged individualist spirit of Crocodile Dundee?
[02:23:57.726 --> 02:23:58.747]  Where were the protests?
[02:23:58.827 --> 02:24:06.434]  Where was the mass revolt against this disastrous zero Covid policy that the Australian health authorities have been pursuing?
[02:24:06.514 --> 02:24:20.171]   Where is the revolt against this Lockdown tyranny to the point where if you go three kilometres outside your home, the police send a drone, they track your licence plate, they issue fines, they issue arrests.
[02:24:20.211 --> 02:24:28.897]   At one point they were even talking about Fitting people who were supposed to be isolating at home with electronic ankle bracelets.
[02:24:28.958 --> 02:24:50.349]   We had a story a couple of weeks ago where they're introducing now, I think it's in the state of Victoria, this program where you have to download a government app if you're supposed to be self-isolating and if the government calls you up within 15 minutes You have to take a geolocation-tagged selfie and send it to the government just to prove where you are.
[02:24:50.409 --> 02:24:54.311]  This is beyond a Chinese communist-style social credit score.
[02:24:54.631 --> 02:24:56.192]  This is the next level.
[02:24:57.072 --> 02:24:59.354]  And we were asking what the line in the sand would be.
[02:24:59.414 --> 02:25:04.436]  Well, we found that line over the past few days because there has been an uprising.
[02:25:05.537 --> 02:25:08.318]  We had the yellow vests in France back in late 2018 into 2019.
[02:25:10.891 --> 02:25:17.737]  Of course, revolting against President Macron, his globalist measures to basically crush the economy.
[02:25:17.797 --> 02:25:19.479]  The French farmers were out on the streets.
[02:25:19.539 --> 02:25:23.202]  We saw that movement expand to Germany, to the Netherlands.
[02:25:23.903 --> 02:25:29.508]  Well, now we're seeing the rise of the Orange Vest Revolution in Australia.
[02:25:29.568 --> 02:25:30.890]  Headline out of Breitbart.
[02:25:31.550 --> 02:25:36.495]  Chaos down under as anti-lockdown protesters clash with riot police in Melbourne.
[02:25:37.429 --> 02:25:47.697]  The streets of Melbourne were plunged into chaos once again on Tuesday as anti-lockdown protesters clashed with riot police, forcing police vehicles to retreat as they smashed windows and hurled makeshift missiles.
[02:25:48.438 --> 02:25:56.764]  This is the construction workers whose union told them that they would be mandated to take the COVID-19 vaccine or lose their jobs.
[02:25:56.804 --> 02:26:01.147]  We have a video about this and I'm going to talk about the latest when we get back.
[02:26:01.808 --> 02:26:06.411]  But here is what is happening in Australia with the rise of the Orange Vest Movement.
[02:26:06.471 --> 02:26:06.972]  Here's the clip.
[02:26:08.095 --> 02:26:12.417]  Are we witnessing the start of a yellow vest style revolt in Australia?
[02:26:12.517 --> 02:26:16.859]  Or more accurately, is this the beginning of the Orange Vest Uprising?
[02:26:16.919 --> 02:26:23.121]  The union that represents construction workers mandated that they all get the vaccine or lose their jobs.
[02:26:23.281 --> 02:26:25.722]  Suffice to say, they weren't too happy about it.
[02:26:25.862 --> 02:26:36.767]  A day after attempting to storm the union building itself, construction workers marched through Melbourne wearing yellow and orange jackets while chanting, F the jab and enough is enough.
[02:26:37.307 --> 02:26:37.507]  Everyone!
[02:26:37.887 --> 02:26:38.047]  Everyone!

[02:26:50.092 --> 02:26:50.252]  Everyone!
[02:26:50.672 --> 02:26:50.852]  Everyone!
[02:26:51.432 --> 02:26:51.632]  Everyone!
[02:26:52.733 --> 02:26:52.953]  Everyone!
[02:26:53.533 --> 02:26:53.833]  Everyone!
[02:26:54.574 --> 02:26:54.774]  Everyone!
[02:26:55.234 --> 02:26:55.394]  Everyone!
[02:26:55.774 --> 02:26:56.034]  Everyone!
[02:26:57.935 --> 02:26:58.135]  Everyone!
[02:26:58.595 --> 02:26:58.755]  Everyone!
[02:26:59.155 --> 02:26:59.375]  Everyone!
[02:26:59.976 --> 02:27:00.156]  Everyone!
[02:27:00.536 --> 02:27:00.796]  Everyone!
[02:27:01.256 --> 02:27:01.516]  Everyone!
[02:27:03.757 --> 02:27:03.937]  Everyone!
[02:27:04.477 --> 02:27:04.697]  Everyone!
[02:27:05.158 --> 02:27:05.418]  Everyone!
[02:27:06.678 --> 02:27:07.158]  Get him!
[02:27:08.439 --> 02:27:08.619]  Whoa!
[02:27:08.759 --> 02:27:13.341]  Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[02:27:13.381 --> 02:27:19.763]  Protesters reached the Westgate Freeway, blocked traffic in both directions, and then occupied the Westgate Bridge.
[02:27:19.622 --> 02:27:24.502]   Despite facing traffic jams, the people stuck in their vehicles appeared to offer support.
[02:27:24.502 --> 02:27:36.903]  [Sounds of people screaming]
[02:27:36.903 --> 02:27:42.422]   Authorities and the media have dismissed the protest as a bunch of right-wing extremists and neo-Nazis.
[02:27:42.533 --> 02:27:43.873]  Wow, didn't see that one coming.
[02:27:43.973 --> 02:27:48.375]  But is this the rallying point that Australians have been crying out for?
[02:27:48.575 --> 02:27:53.538]  Facing draconian restrictions and 11 grand fines merely for protesting.
[02:27:53.718 --> 02:27:59.381]  Is the yellow or orange jacket the new symbol of resistance just as it was in France?
[02:27:59.561 --> 02:28:04.183]  Does it provide Aussies with a unifying emblem around which they can build solidarity?
[02:28:04.383 --> 02:28:17.791]  Melbourne witnessed numerous scenes of extreme police brutality during protests this past weekend, including a 70-year-old woman being pushed to the floor and pepper sprayed in the face by police, because they really care about public health.
[02:28:17.851 --> 02:28:26.936]  Such scenes have generated increasing anger, international condemnation, and the realisation that Australia is no longer a democratic country.
[02:28:27.056 --> 02:28:37.937]  But it does now appear that the yellow and orange vest uprising could be the fork in the road where Aussies finally come together and declare enough is enough.
[02:28:40.976 --> 02:28:43.938]  So there you have it, some actual positive news.
[02:28:43.998 --> 02:28:47.340]  Yes, positive news, a rare sight on this broadcast.
[02:28:47.681 --> 02:28:55.786]  But of course, the reason this is happening is because Australia continues to pursue the most brutal, the most draconian lockdown in the developed world.
[02:28:56.226 --> 02:29:03.531]  They had one COVID case, for example, in a town, Alice Springs, which was 800 miles from the nearest city.
[02:29:04.071 --> 02:29:05.612]  And they do this time and time again.
[02:29:05.653 --> 02:29:08.174]  They put the full town into lockdown.
[02:29:08.474 --> 02:29:10.696]  There's no differentiation whatsoever.
[02:29:11.476 --> 02:29:15.879]  I was just looking through the headlines that we've had about Australia over the past six months.
[02:29:16.619 --> 02:29:20.721]  Lockdown Australians, alcohol intake monitored and restricted by the state.
[02:29:20.761 --> 02:29:26.965]  The people in the public housing, the apartments, under lockdown again for months and months on end.
[02:29:27.005 --> 02:29:35.526]   The only way that they could try and get through it We know, by the way, that suicides have drastically increased throughout Australia as a result of lockdown.
[02:29:36.047 --> 02:29:40.171]  Some people trying to get through it by basically drinking their way through it.
[02:29:40.231 --> 02:29:48.679]  But even the government came along and said, no, you can't do that because they really care about your health, even as untold numbers of them are committing suicide.
[02:29:49.395 --> 02:30:00.860]  The government literally intercepted parcels that family members were sending to these people in social housing in these apartments, searching it for alcohol and confiscating the booze.
[02:30:01.380 --> 02:30:12.285]  We had top health officials in Australia come out and basically tell the unvaccinated that they'll remain under lockdown restrictions forever, which is another reason why you're seeing this orange vest revolt.
[02:30:13.145 --> 02:30:19.270]   We have another headline Woman in quarantine harassed by cops for removing face masks to drink tea.
[02:30:19.810 --> 02:30:27.013]  In these self-isolation gulags, they literally patrol these prisons that they've kept Australians in.
[02:30:27.053 --> 02:30:28.594]  It was supposed to be self-isolating.
[02:30:28.634 --> 02:30:33.396]  If they remove their masks for a second to drink their tea, the cops swoop on them.
[02:30:34.156 --> 02:30:41.320]  Meanwhile, Australian police violate lockdown rules to host LGBT office party because obviously that's more important.
[02:30:41.340 --> 02:30:48.524]   So the actual officials enforcing this brutal lockdown Once again, as in America with the Emmy Hollywood Elite, the rules don't apply to them.
[02:30:49.904 --> 02:30:53.586]  Australian police pepper spray children for not wearing face masks.
[02:30:54.026 --> 02:30:56.287]  You see numerous people tackled in the street.
[02:30:56.687 --> 02:31:02.549]  We had a story out of Brisbane about a month ago where an old guy was jogging in a park exercising.
[02:31:02.569 --> 02:31:06.491]  You're not supposed to wear a face mask while you're doing hardcore exercise.
[02:31:06.511 --> 02:31:07.872]  You could literally choke to death.
[02:31:08.172 --> 02:31:11.293]  They tackled him, dragged him to the ground, had a cardiac arrest.
[02:31:12.014 --> 02:31:15.277]  We've had authorities saying they won't hesitate to go door to door.
[02:31:16.217 --> 02:31:20.601]  We've had Australian health officials telling grandparents don't go anywhere near your grandkids.
[02:31:21.261 --> 02:31:29.368]  And remember, these orange vests who are out on the streets now in Melbourne going up against the police, going up against the union that's mandating them to get this jab.
[02:31:30.174 --> 02:31:36.139]  They face fines of $11,000 merely for engaging in any form of protest.
[02:31:36.199 --> 02:31:37.941]  That's how bad it's become.
[02:31:38.481 --> 02:31:48.249]  In fact, even posting about an anti-lockdown protest online can not only get you a massive fine, it can get you a home visit from the police.
[02:31:48.830 --> 02:31:55.135]  We saw that with the pregnant woman who was arrested, handcuffed in front of her children, and that was six months ago.
[02:31:55.195 --> 02:31:57.277]  It's only gotten worse since.
[02:31:58.268 --> 02:32:09.010]  Of course, Dr. Kerry Chant, the New South Wales public health official, coming out and saying, don't talk to your friends, don't talk to your neighbours, don't post about it online, don't complain about it.
[02:32:09.250 --> 02:32:14.251]  Well, they're not only complaining about it, they're out en masse, on the streets, rebelling.
[02:32:14.431 --> 02:32:20.453]  It's a new rise of a new movement, the Orange Vest Movement, and it's fantastic to see.
[02:32:20.813 --> 02:32:21.413]  We'll be back.
[02:32:21.553 --> 02:32:22.733]  Summit.News, don't go away.
[02:32:22.853 --> 02:32:35.256]   Well, I was in the cinema a couple of days ago for the first time in 18 months or more, and there were literally people sat in the cinema wearing masks throughout a two and a half hour film.
[02:32:35.816 --> 02:32:46.159]  Again, they removed the mask to eat a handful of popcorn because we know, of course, that the virus knows when you're eating a handful of popcorn and it relents, it falls back.
[02:32:46.846 --> 02:32:54.294]  But then when you put the popcorn carton down, you have to put the mask back on because the COVID knows that you've put the mask back on.
[02:32:54.354 --> 02:32:56.336]  It knows that you're not eating the popcorn anymore.
[02:32:56.836 --> 02:33:05.385]  Just as it knows when you've sat down at the table, it's important to wear the mask for that 10-yard walk from the entrance of the restaurant to the table.
[02:33:05.705 --> 02:33:08.708]  As soon as you've sat down at the table, you know you're safe.
[02:33:08.769 --> 02:33:10.030]  You know you can remove the mask.
[02:33:10.825 --> 02:33:16.709]  Well, the people who were very keen on removing their masks over the past couple of days, once again, are the Hollywood elite.
[02:33:16.729 --> 02:33:22.793]  The same kind of people who will screech at you for not wearing one inside a near-empty grocery store.
[02:33:23.674 --> 02:33:25.175]  Of course, we had this story yesterday.
[02:33:25.755 --> 02:33:28.597]  But there was an update about it, which we covered earlier today.
[02:33:28.677 --> 02:33:31.719]  First, let's explain what happened Sunday night at the Emmys.
[02:33:31.779 --> 02:33:33.240]  This clip is maskless.
[02:33:33.280 --> 02:33:35.962]  Hollywood elite laugh at you at the Emmys.
[02:33:35.982 --> 02:33:38.684]  We'll come back and talk about the latest, but here it is.
[02:33:39.585 --> 02:33:52.112]  The same Hollywood elite who will screech on Twitter about you not wearing a face mask in a near-empty grocery store, all gathered in close proximity in huge numbers at the Emmys to slobber all over each other completely maskless.
[02:33:52.192 --> 02:33:58.055]  And once again, they were all attended to by an army of worker slave drones, all of whom had to wear masks.
[02:33:58.155 --> 02:33:59.636]  I've seen more social distancing.
[02:34:01.477 --> 02:34:05.080]  But you're bad for wanting to visit your grandma at Thanksgiving.
[02:34:05.260 --> 02:34:10.725]  The woman in yellow is rich and famous and thus immune to COVID and thus is free to walk without a mask.
[02:34:10.745 --> 02:34:16.269]  Sadly the staff at the end of the video are not rich or famous, lack immunity and thus must cover their faces for their own good.
[02:34:16.349 --> 02:34:21.674]  California has a mask mandate for all indoor events even if you're fully vaccinated.
[02:34:21.734 --> 02:34:28.860]  But apparently so long as you show up in a backless luxury Dior dress and smother yourself in two million dollars worth of Tiffany diamonds...
[02:34:29.460 --> 02:34:30.881]  The rules no longer apply.
[02:34:30.981 --> 02:34:35.305]  Four-year-old children in California have to wear face coverings in class.
[02:34:35.385 --> 02:34:44.752]  Yet these twats get to genuflect and drool all over each other all night giving speeches about what good people they are with not a mask in sight.
[02:34:44.912 --> 02:34:51.557]  My kids eat their lunches on their laps in the school auditorium facing forward and get yelled at if they talk to friends.
[02:34:51.657 --> 02:34:58.262]  Comedian Seth Rogen was praised for being the only self-aware person in the room to point out the disconnect.
[02:34:58.422 --> 02:35:01.825]  Let me start by saying there is way too many of us in this little room!
[02:35:01.845 --> 02:35:04.047]  What are we doing?
[02:35:04.667 --> 02:35:06.028]  They said this was outdoors!
[02:35:06.849 --> 02:35:07.350]  It's not!
[02:35:09.238 --> 02:35:10.299]  They lied to us!
[02:35:10.499 --> 02:35:13.542]  We're in a hermetically sealed tent right now!
[02:35:13.562 --> 02:35:17.144]  But this wasn't an impromptu moment of spontaneous self-awareness.
[02:35:17.545 --> 02:35:19.106]  The jokes were scripted.
[02:35:19.186 --> 02:35:20.928]  They were written before the event.
[02:35:21.088 --> 02:35:22.229]  They're laughing at you.
[02:35:22.309 --> 02:35:30.936]  They even had some kind of DJ announcing that all the COVID guidelines were being followed, while the camera literally showed celebrities hugging and kissing.
[02:35:33.733 --> 02:35:37.733]  I'm going to set my humanity in peace.
[02:35:37.733 --> 02:35:41.733]   We are going to celebrate and party, but while we're doing that,
[02:35:41.733 --> 02:35:45.733]   absolutely following all the official health and safety guidelines
[02:35:45.733 --> 02:35:50.733]   that some really smart people asked us to do to keep us safe from COVID.
[02:35:50.733 --> 02:35:52.733]  They're taking the piss.
[02:35:52.234 --> 02:35:58.740]  But despite this avalanche of vile hypocrisy, what was the main point of concern afterwards on Twitter?
[02:35:58.800 --> 02:36:01.342]  Too many white people winning awards!
[02:36:01.362 --> 02:36:03.904]  Because God forbid talent should be judged on...
[02:36:04.565 --> 02:36:07.827]  Actual talent, and not just on skin pigmentation.
[02:36:07.887 --> 02:36:18.133]  Meanwhile, more footage has emerged of AOC at the Met Gala, being attended to by a phalanx of masked worker slaves, while she and her maskless husband laugh it up.
[02:36:18.334 --> 02:36:19.614]  Keep complying, idiots.
[02:36:19.975 --> 02:36:22.096]  Just shut up, and keep complying.
[02:36:24.028 --> 02:36:33.510]  Well, there you have it, once again proving that the face nappy is not just the symbol of conformity, it is the symbol of the modern-day worker-drone-slave.
[02:36:34.090 --> 02:36:53.093]  But don't worry, because the health authorities, in all their infinite wisdom, have come out and explained this all away, because they've come out today and said that, quote, performers, performers, that means the rich and famous, are exempt from mask rules, so move along, it's all been explained.
[02:36:53.743 --> 02:37:12.656]  This is the LA County Department of Public Health who responded to criticism of what you just saw on that video by claiming that the rules didn't apply because it was a television production event and it featured some people in expensive dresses smothered with Tiffany diamonds and so, you know, they were exempt.
[02:37:12.996 --> 02:37:25.610]   Just like London Breed, the mayor of San Francisco, went for a night out in a nightclub with live music She was seen taking photos, maskless again, against the rules in California.
[02:37:26.090 --> 02:37:28.691]  But she said, oh, don't be the fun police.
[02:37:29.331 --> 02:37:31.252]  Yeah, our point exactly.
[02:37:31.512 --> 02:37:34.012]  But when they do it, they can get away with it.
[02:37:34.052 --> 02:37:37.434]  And they do this mealy mouth thing where it's like, oh, no, we're performers.
[02:37:38.354 --> 02:37:40.895]  So why were the slaves wearing the masks then?
[02:37:41.215 --> 02:37:44.356]  If it's a television event, even though it's indoors?
[02:37:45.655 --> 02:37:49.898]  Why were only the celebrities made to not wear masks?
[02:37:49.978 --> 02:37:52.619]  Why were the slaves, the worker drones, made to wear masks?
[02:37:52.740 --> 02:37:54.080]  Why weren't they exempt?
[02:37:55.862 --> 02:38:06.868]  Under Los Angeles County's Department of Health guidelines, everyone aged two years and older must wear a face covering, quote, in all indoor public settings, venues, gatherings and public and private businesses.
[02:38:07.329 --> 02:38:24.988]   However, after it was asserted that the rules don't apply to the rich and famous, the department was forced to respond They said, this is Oliver Darcy, LA County Department of Public Health tells me that the maskless Emmys were not in violation of the mask mandate because exemptions are made for film, television and music productions.
[02:38:25.448 --> 02:38:38.474]  Just like exemptions are made for John Kerry walking through an airport, or John Kerry walking through airport security, or all those Democrats who skipped the vote and got on a private plane and none of them were wearing masks.
[02:38:39.054 --> 02:38:40.915]  I guess they were performers as well.
[02:38:41.335 --> 02:38:49.417]  I guess Nancy Pelosi was a performer when she got to get her hair done and wasn't wearing a mask inside the hair salon.
[02:38:50.297 --> 02:38:58.519]  I guess Governor Gavin Newsom, when he went for a posh dinner in a fancy French restaurant, wasn't wearing a mask in violation of the rules.
[02:38:58.899 --> 02:39:00.519]  I guess he was a performer.
[02:39:01.800 --> 02:39:18.349]   So apparently, as long as you're making a television production or you just describe yourself as a performer, Covid-19 recognises that fact and doesn't show up for the night, much like it disappears as soon as people sit down to eat at a restaurant, but not while they walk to the table.
[02:39:19.390 --> 02:39:29.021]  And in fact, the LA County Health Authorities went further, insisting that the event organisers, quote, exceeded the baseline requirements for television and film productions.
[02:39:29.617 --> 02:39:45.791]  Despite, again, being indoors in direct violation of their rules, before asserting that the full vaccination of all those present was one of the most powerful ways to achieve a safe environment, yeah, even though you admit your vaccines are crap and they don't work properly, and they can still spread the virus even though they're vaccinated.
[02:39:47.592 --> 02:39:53.597]  So again, apparently if you're a performer, or in other words, rich and famous, you don't have to wear a mask.
[02:39:53.797 --> 02:39:55.919]  Everybody is a performer.
[02:39:57.060 --> 02:40:11.056]   Meanwhile, Brazilian President Bolsonaro, who should have identified as a performer, then maybe he would have been allowed inside restaurants in New York, forced to eat pizza on sidewalk in New York because he's not vaccinated.
[02:40:11.197 --> 02:40:20.965]  Even though he had COVID and recovered from it as natural immunity, which gives him 27 times more protection than getting the vaccine, he's not allowed inside a pizza restaurant in New York.
[02:40:21.626 --> 02:40:23.648]  Again, should have identified as a performer.
[02:40:24.722 --> 02:40:34.886]  After arriving for the UN General Assembly, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro was forced to eat pizza on the sidewalk because he's not vaccinated and therefore banned from indoor dining in New York.
[02:40:35.727 --> 02:40:45.230]  While elites in Hollywood and New York get to ignore COVID restrictions when attending indoor events, like at the Emmys, being the leader of a major country isn't enough to get you an exemption.
[02:40:46.291 --> 02:41:12.974]   Of course, we had the story a couple of days ago where the United Nations itself came out In violation of New York's rules and said, people attending that globalist confab, the globalists who haven't had their vaccine, maybe because they know what's in it, they won't have to provide a vaccine passport or any kind of COVID check to enter the UN building for this General Assembly meeting in New York.
[02:41:13.681 --> 02:41:21.444]  So again, I guess they, you know, they identified as performers or musicians, or they were just rich and famous, or they were just very powerful.
[02:41:21.865 --> 02:41:23.545]  They're not subject to the same rules as you.
[02:41:24.426 --> 02:41:34.310]  Meanwhile, a Black Lives Matter protest is being planned outside a restaurant in New York because three black women were denied entry on the basis that they couldn't prove they had the jab.
[02:41:35.032 --> 02:41:38.893]  In some areas of America, 50% of the black community hasn't had the jab.
[02:41:39.434 --> 02:41:52.198]  Is this how we defeat the vaccine passport in California, in New York, by pointing out that it's discriminatory and it's creating segregation, which as we know is racist?
[02:41:52.278 --> 02:41:53.799]  Could that be the ultimate death knell?
[02:41:54.099 --> 02:41:55.921]  For the vaccine passport in New York.
[02:41:55.981 --> 02:41:56.502]  Don't go away.
[02:41:56.542 --> 02:41:57.202]  Summit.News.
[02:41:57.362 --> 02:41:58.003]  We'll be right back.
[02:41:58.524 --> 02:42:10.416]  Of course, Joe Biden has genuflected in front of the UN Globalist to push the myth of man-made global warming once again today, vowing to double aid to developing countries vulnerable to climate crisis.
[02:42:11.056 --> 02:42:14.978]  Even as all their predictions about the climate crisis have proven spectacularly wrong.
[02:42:15.018 --> 02:42:19.019]  These are the same people who said we'd enter a new ice age in the 70s.
[02:42:19.399 --> 02:42:23.661]  These are the same people who say Arctic ice is going to disappear every single summer.
[02:42:23.941 --> 02:42:26.062]  They're proven wrong time and time again.
[02:42:26.082 --> 02:42:30.343]  Well, we have a group here in the UK which has proven particularly virulent.
[02:42:30.503 --> 02:42:35.485]  It's called Extinction Rebellion, despite the fact that it's literally Extinction Establishment.
[02:42:36.184 --> 02:42:44.351]  Because all of their narratives are being amplified by academia, by the media, by celebrities, by cultural institutions.
[02:42:44.431 --> 02:42:50.536]  It's far from a rebellion if every organ of the establishment is pushing the same narrative.
[02:42:51.097 --> 02:43:02.146]  And they've been out once again blocking roads, stopping people with actual jobs from getting to work here in the UK for the fifth time in the space of the week.
[02:43:03.295 --> 02:43:08.098]  M25 protests, 38 arrested as Insulate Britain group blocks motorway for fifth time.
[02:43:08.138 --> 02:43:12.821]  They've just rebranded themselves from Extinction Rebellion because everyone hates Extinction Rebellion.
[02:43:13.481 --> 02:43:26.529]  These are the same people who literally blocked commuter trains two years ago, stopped people from getting to work at 6am in the morning, because apparently electric-powered commuter trains are now part of the problem as well.
[02:43:27.807 --> 02:43:37.393]  38 people have been arrested after climate protesters from the Insulate Britain, it's Extinction Rebellion, call it what it is, attempted to block the M25 for a fifth time.
[02:43:38.213 --> 02:43:41.916]  They're literally causing pilots running in the middle of a busy road.
[02:43:42.436 --> 02:43:44.557]  There was a woman airlifted to hospital.
[02:43:44.817 --> 02:43:49.140]  They've had actual insulation engineers stopped from getting to work.
[02:43:49.787 --> 02:43:52.369]  Trying to carry out the very thing that they demand.
[02:43:52.769 --> 02:43:54.290]  They're complete idiots.
[02:43:54.370 --> 02:43:57.652]  They're ego maniacs doing it for the Instagram clout.
[02:43:58.053 --> 02:44:01.275]  Here's a quick video summarizing what we've witnessed so far.
[02:44:01.775 --> 02:44:03.537]  This is Extinction Rebellion.
[02:44:03.697 --> 02:44:05.898]  Idiots block roads yet again.
[02:44:05.958 --> 02:44:06.899]  Let's go to the clip.
[02:44:08.132 --> 02:44:17.818]  Extinction Rebellion activists caused commuter chaos for people who have actual jobs by blocking roads outside of London for the fourth time in a week.
[02:44:18.039 --> 02:44:24.983]  Because it's so universally loathed, Extinction Rebellion has rebranded itself as Insulate Britain.
[02:44:25.023 --> 02:44:33.928]   They're so desperate to insulate Britain that their road blockades have stopped actual insulation engineers From getting to work, Galaxy Brain Genius.
[02:44:34.069 --> 02:44:42.973]  The group's ringleader is so concerned about home insulation that his own home uses gas central heating, is single glazed and has no insulation in any of the walls.
[02:44:43.093 --> 02:44:44.534]  Such commitment to the cause.
[02:44:44.574 --> 02:44:51.657]  The group's main achievement appears to be massively increasing the number of cars spewing CO2 as they sit idling.
[02:44:51.797 --> 02:44:52.878]  Again, genius.
[02:44:52.998 --> 02:45:00.882]  While also causing a huge pile-up that led to a massive car accident, leading to a woman being airlifted to hospital with serious injuries.
[02:45:00.962 --> 02:45:02.023]  Well done, dickheads!
[02:45:02.223 --> 02:45:12.128]  But just like back in 2019 when the idiots found out what happens when you try to stop a train full of people getting to work early in the morning, irate commuters angrily confronted them once again.
[02:45:12.148 --> 02:45:14.769]  Why the hell do you think this is the right thing to do?! !
[02:45:16.309 --> 02:45:18.850]  But this isn't our... I know what your fight is.
[02:45:19.070 --> 02:45:22.571]  I completely agree that this is a really, really good idea.
[02:45:23.251 --> 02:45:24.732]  But this is not the way to do it.
[02:45:25.012 --> 02:45:30.454]  You're causing more pollution by all of these cars just sitting here doing fucking nothing.
[02:45:32.374 --> 02:45:38.176]  Oh, that's the solution.
[02:45:39.215 --> 02:45:40.036]  This is ridiculous.
[02:45:40.676 --> 02:45:42.017]  You're doing this over and over again.
[02:45:42.117 --> 02:45:43.358]  You're not helping the cause.
[02:45:43.398 --> 02:45:44.539]  You're making people's pizzas.
[02:45:44.599 --> 02:45:50.163]  Why the fuck are you out protesting when the government is doing everything you want anyway?
[02:45:50.363 --> 02:46:01.211]  Banning petrol cars, forcing Britain to pursue zero carbon, implementing disastrous green energy policies that lead to massive unemployment and soaring energy prices.
[02:46:01.271 --> 02:46:05.032]  They're already doing all that, so what are you protesting for?
[02:46:05.172 --> 02:46:14.894]  Boris Johnson literally installed his eco-mentalist wife in number 10 Downing Street as the de facto Prime Minister of the country, and you're still whining.
[02:46:15.074 --> 02:46:23.176]  The Financial Times, the Davos billionaire's paper of record, lavishly praises you, and you still think you're fighting the system.
[02:46:23.316 --> 02:46:33.597]   While cracking the heads of anti-lockdown protesters, the police treat you like they're providing friendly customer service, and you think you're going up against the man.
[02:46:33.597 --> 02:46:36.317]  If you've got any questions at all, just ask.
[02:46:36.317 --> 02:46:42.337]   And if any of you are in any discomfort or need anything, just let me know and we'll try and sort you out in a nice
[02:46:42.337 --> 02:46:42.796]  way.
[02:46:42.796 --> 02:46:44.796]  Can't phrase that any worse, could I?
[02:46:44.796 --> 02:46:47.356]  But no, if you need any assistance at all, just let me know.
[02:46:47.356 --> 02:46:50.557]   Foreign Office Minister James Cleverley appeared on GMB this morning
[02:46:50.557 --> 02:46:55.836]   to re-emphasise that the government is totally acquiescing to all your demands.
[02:46:55.948 --> 02:46:57.049]  Little tip for you here.
[02:46:57.129 --> 02:47:14.999]  If the media, transnational corporations, cultural institutions, celebrities and academia are all amplifying the exact same message as you, and if the government is literally implementing the very same policies that you're demanding, you're not the rebellion, you're the establishment.
[02:47:16.843 --> 02:47:23.265]  So there you have it, and those idiots, hippie morons, were out blocking traffic yet again this morning.
[02:47:23.285 --> 02:47:26.346]  They had the guy on GB News, the founder of the group.
[02:47:26.726 --> 02:47:33.308]  Turns out his home isn't insulated, he's got single glazing and gas heating, and he's not going to do anything about it.
[02:47:34.048 --> 02:47:36.269]  Again, I've been at anti-lockdown protests.
[02:47:36.669 --> 02:47:46.663]   If they try to block a road, in many cases the exact same road in Westminster or Parliament Square, They send the riot police in within 10 minutes to crack heads.
[02:47:47.224 --> 02:47:48.585]  Meanwhile, you saw the clip there.
[02:47:48.945 --> 02:47:50.326]  Oh, are you feeling uncomfortable?
[02:47:50.606 --> 02:47:52.507]  If you have any complaints, just let us know.
[02:47:52.527 --> 02:47:54.789]  It's like they've been given customer service.
[02:47:55.429 --> 02:48:00.833]  The police are doing their bidding, the government's doing their bidding, passing all the policies they want.
[02:48:01.233 --> 02:48:03.355]  Why are they even out there?
[02:48:03.655 --> 02:48:05.196]  Absolutely insane.
[02:48:06.036 --> 02:48:10.203]   Meanwhile, And we're going to go to this clip here, final clip of the show.
[02:48:10.283 --> 02:48:16.986]  Fauci struggles to answer why Americans with natural COVID immunity should get vaccinated.
[02:48:17.507 --> 02:48:25.690]  During a segment on CNN, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the great deity now, struggled to explain why Americans who have natural immunity to COVID should get the vaccine.
[02:48:25.910 --> 02:48:27.951]  And here is what he said.
[02:48:28.051 --> 02:48:28.932]  Let's go to the clip.
[02:48:30.222 --> 02:48:41.729]  And just real quickly, there was a study that came out of Israel about natural immunity, and basically the headline was that natural immunity provides a lot of protection, even better than the vaccines alone.
[02:48:43.830 --> 02:48:45.231]  What are people to make of that?
[02:48:45.331 --> 02:48:55.998]  So as we talk about vaccine mandates, I get calls all the time, people say, I've already had COVID, I'm protected, and now the study says maybe even more protected than the vaccine alone.
[02:48:56.538 --> 02:48:58.079]  Should they also get the vaccine?
[02:48:58.119 --> 02:48:59.080]  How do you make the case to them?
[02:49:01.291 --> 02:49:02.952]  You know, that's a really good point Sanjay.
[02:49:03.052 --> 02:49:05.533]  I don't have a really firm answer for you on that.
[02:49:05.573 --> 02:49:10.554]  That's something that we're going to have to discuss regarding the durability of the response.
[02:49:10.614 --> 02:49:21.920]   The one thing the paper from Israel didn't tell you is whether or not as high as the protection is with natural infection, What's the durability compared to the durability of a vaccine?
[02:49:22.020 --> 02:49:28.345]  So it is conceivable that you got infected, you're protected, but you may not be protected for an indefinite period of time.
[02:49:28.765 --> 02:49:38.693]  So I think that is something that we need to sit down and discuss seriously because you very appropriately pointed out it is an issue and there could be an argument for saying what you said.
[02:49:39.794 --> 02:49:44.831]   And where are we on kids below the age of So there you have it.
[02:49:44.991 --> 02:49:51.537]  He said the COVID immunity, natural COVID immunity, may not protect people for an indefinite period of time.
[02:49:52.258 --> 02:50:05.130]  This is the same guy pushing the booster vaccines because the vaccine itself has not protected people for any conceivable length of time, less than six months, which is why the booster shots are already being rolled out.
[02:50:05.908 --> 02:50:19.615]  Then what he said is directly disproven by the study that Sanjay Gupta cited, which the Times of Israel reported, showed that natural immunity provided Israelis, quote, longer lasting delta defence than vaccines.
[02:50:19.655 --> 02:50:25.818]  So the answer to his question, or his dismissal of this, is provided by the study itself.
[02:50:26.917 --> 02:50:37.507]  Says the variant was 27 times more likely to break through Pfizer protection from January to February and cause symptoms than it was to penetrate natural immunity from the same period.
[02:50:37.827 --> 02:50:43.272]  But again, you're not going to be allowed to present natural immunity certificates because it's not about public health.
[02:50:43.652 --> 02:50:45.534]  It's about mass compliance.
[02:50:46.275 --> 02:50:49.738]  Meanwhile, Victor Orban gives Pope warning about mass migration to the West.
[02:50:50.851 --> 02:50:59.233]  He asked Pope Francis not to let Christianity perish, as he gave him a gift that challenged the Supreme Pontiff's advocacy for mass immigration.
[02:51:00.453 --> 02:51:12.296]  The King, this is the gift he gave him, it was a letter that King Bela IV wrote for Pope Innocent IV in 1250, where he said the King warned of the looming threat of the Tartar invasion and called for the unity of Europe.
[02:51:12.336 --> 02:51:12.976]  He was ignored.
[02:51:12.996 --> 02:51:17.817]  35 years later, he fended off the Tartars with great bloodshed.
[02:51:18.487 --> 02:51:24.270]  So this warning on the consequences of mass immigration was given to the Pope by the Hungarian leader Viktor Orban.
[02:51:24.610 --> 02:51:30.593]  The Pope's response, and bear in mind this is the same guy who's pushed globalist UN global warming mantras.
[02:51:30.853 --> 02:51:36.416]  He's washed the feet of migrants and said, invite them all in from Islamic countries into Europe.
[02:51:36.796 --> 02:51:42.179]  He literally came out after the Charlie Hebdo massacre and said they were basically justified in what they did.
[02:51:42.759 --> 02:51:49.824]  He said, oh if you punched my mother I'd respond as well, literally justifying the massacre of the cartoonists in Paris.
[02:51:50.645 --> 02:52:05.536]  Well now he's come out and said Pope Francis says some people wanted me dead as he hits back at the conservative critics of the Catholic Church and he basically says anyone who criticizes the Catholic Church, which is him, is engaging in quote the work of the devil.
[02:52:05.596 --> 02:52:18.603]   No, you're engaging in the work of the devil By completely abandoning all the Catholic tenets that you're supposed to protect and defend, which at its core is the Christian base of Europe as a civilization.
[02:52:18.643 --> 02:52:19.504]  That's going to wrap it up.
[02:52:19.544 --> 02:52:20.924]  Summit.News, War Room is next.
[02:52:20.944 --> 02:52:21.645]  Don't go away.
[02:52:24.924 --> 02:52:32.170]  In the late 1920s, Adolf Hitler was in a German prison for staging an attempted overthrow of the government.
[02:52:32.610 --> 02:52:36.313]  And he wrote a book called Mein Kampf, or My Struggle.
[02:52:36.954 --> 02:52:49.323]  And in the book, he described how he was going to unite Germany, empower it, build back up its weapons and munitions, and punish France and others for what happened in World War I and the Treaty of Versailles.
[02:52:49.904 --> 02:52:53.386]  Now, people didn't listen to Hitler, even when he got elected president in 1933.
[02:52:54.267 --> 02:52:58.134]  Or when he merged himself with the office of the Chancellor and made himself a dictator.
[02:52:58.775 --> 02:53:05.187]  But by 1940 they did listen when he began to invade all those different nations around him and the rest is history.
[02:53:05.998 --> 02:53:16.622]  Well, we better listen to Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates and Ted Turner and the guy that set them up with this whole UN Great Reset, David Rockefeller, and his Operation Lockstep.
[02:53:16.762 --> 02:53:18.542]  He died at 101 a few years ago.
[02:53:18.942 --> 02:53:28.766]  Because they engineered the plan to use the fear of a virus to bring in a world ID and to have permanent lockdowns where the general public are prisoners in their homes and forcibly injected.
[02:53:29.486 --> 02:53:31.167]  Everything we've talked about is coming true.
[02:53:31.687 --> 02:53:41.672]  And the globalists in their own books, like the Great Reset written by Klaus Schwab, or the Fourth Industrial Revolution, or Zbigniew Brzezinski's books, all admit this sickening evil plan.
[02:53:41.892 --> 02:53:43.153]  We have their battle plan.
[02:53:43.613 --> 02:53:49.656]  And finally, the public is starting to realize that Infowars didn't crystal ball all this information.
[02:53:50.276 --> 02:53:55.523]  We simply had the documents and that's why it's so important to keep us on air now more than ever.
[02:53:55.563 --> 02:53:58.546]  So in the minute and a half I have left to talk to you this emergency announcement.
[02:53:58.666 --> 02:54:06.515]   I'm asking you for my family, for your family, for all of us together as Benjamin Franklin said, We're going to hang together or we're going to hang separate.

[02:54:40.647 --> 02:54:41.707]  Put it on the side of your barn.
[02:54:41.727 --> 02:54:44.730]  Write it on the back of a cocktail napkin.
[02:54:45.010 --> 02:54:49.334]  Whatever you do, realize it's your human potential to take action that overrides these tyrants.
[02:54:49.721 --> 02:54:53.103]  Who are targeting us and targeting our immune systems and targeting our health.

[02:55:54.743 --> 02:55:55.903]  Now, it's really a multivitamin.
[02:55:55.923 --> 02:55:57.204]  We're sold out of our multivitamin.
[02:55:57.524 --> 02:55:59.264]  This is a high-end multivitamin mineral.
[02:55:59.283 --> 02:56:02.083]  It's also good for women, but it's marketed towards men.
