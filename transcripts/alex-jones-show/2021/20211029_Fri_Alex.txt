[00:00:00.129 --> 00:00:11.062]  All the pedophilia, all the racism, all the attacks on capitalism in America and Christianity is a globalist, behavioral psychologist revolution known as the Great Reset.
[00:00:12.103 --> 00:00:16.408]  And that's why you see all the major institutions, all the big banks, all the corporations.
[00:00:16.428 --> 00:00:18.230]  That's why you see the Vatican.
[00:00:19.014 --> 00:00:29.760]  All of this showing that the power of this earth, the god of this world, the fallen one, is making his move and is in control for a short time, that God allows him to be to test us.
[00:00:30.621 --> 00:00:33.142]  And here it is from the Davos Cribstone website.
[00:00:33.162 --> 00:00:33.822]  I want to show this.
[00:00:34.283 --> 00:00:36.144]  The list here is the actual patents.
[00:00:36.804 --> 00:00:37.485]  It's being announced.
[00:00:37.725 --> 00:00:42.167]  Food as production and delivery vehicles for human vaccines.
[00:00:43.948 --> 00:00:46.810]  Grow and eat your own vaccines, University of California.
[00:00:48.416 --> 00:00:53.260]  Functional Hybrid Micro-Nanoparticles Promote Agro-Food Safety Inspection.
[00:00:54.441 --> 00:00:57.184]  And the Davos Group announcements right here.
[00:01:00.347 --> 00:01:07.253]  Where they say, we're already putting nanoparticles in all your food to track and trace what you eat and what's happening with the food.
[00:01:07.653 --> 00:01:13.538]  And this is what we're doing to save the Earth because of coming food shortages because of COVID-19.
[00:01:13.578 --> 00:01:21.774]   But it was the COVID-19 lockdowns Not COVID-19 that caused 25 million extra people to starve to death and 200 million people on the verge of death.
[00:01:22.375 --> 00:01:29.375]   From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:46.375 --> 00:01:52.375]  The domestic war on terror is here, is coming after.
[00:01:52.375 --> 00:01:54.375]  Half of the world.
[00:01:53.787 --> 00:01:58.531]  The helicopters have left Afghanistan, and now they've landed here at home.
[00:01:58.932 --> 00:02:01.414]  And the left is hunting the right.
[00:02:01.894 --> 00:02:06.679]  Sticking them in Guantanamo Bay for American citizens, leaving them there to rot.
[00:02:06.839 --> 00:02:09.561]  We are dealing with an insurgency in the United States.
[00:02:09.581 --> 00:02:14.065]  Terrorism for white supremacy is the most lethal threat to homeland.
[00:02:14.646 --> 00:02:16.588]  I've been told that I'm a white nationalist.
[00:02:16.628 --> 00:02:16.748]  Me!
[00:02:19.508 --> 00:02:23.392]  They've begun to fight a new enemy in a new war on terror.
[00:02:23.672 --> 00:02:24.773]  Not al-Qaeda.
[00:02:24.834 --> 00:02:26.695]  White supremacy.
[00:02:26.776 --> 00:02:29.018]  False flags have happened in this country.
[00:02:33.683 --> 00:02:35.144]  One of which may have been January 6th.
[00:02:34.963 --> 00:02:41.963]  His truth is marching on.
[00:02:41.963 --> 00:02:48.143]  [MUSIC]
[00:02:48.143 --> 00:02:52.643]   Well, if you took a snapshot of the country right now, here is what you'd see.
[00:02:52.725 --> 00:02:54.866]  On the one hand, you have all-out war.
[00:02:55.666 --> 00:03:02.849]  As the American right and the party it has consumed, the Trumpist Republican Party, takes aim at every civic and cultural institution.
[00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:07.191]  From whether we live or die from COVID to our schools and history and democracy itself.
[00:03:07.671 --> 00:03:13.213]  Banning books, senators defending Nazi salutes and unhinged anti-vax protests at school boards.
[00:03:13.693 --> 00:03:17.655]  And the most popular conservative cable news host going full Alex Jones.
[00:03:18.263 --> 00:03:22.865]  ...promoting a fringe conspiracy theory about the January 6th insurrection being a false flag.
[00:03:22.905 --> 00:03:24.846]  So that is all happening.
[00:03:24.906 --> 00:03:34.331]  One of the guests on Tuckum's show last night, shortly after he unveiled his propaganda to rewrite the January 6th insurrection, was Glenn Youngkin, the Republican candidate for governor of Virginia.
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.645]  The new poster child for the Republicans' current twisted priority of banning books.
[00:03:39.185 --> 00:03:51.000]  When they're not trying to reenact Fahrenheit 451, Republicans are continuing to lose their minds over the Justice Department's effort to protect school board officials threatened with violence over race-conscious lessons and mask rules.
[00:03:51.681 --> 00:03:57.484]  We have normcore supposedly Republicans like Glenn Youngkin, who's running in Virginia.
[00:03:57.804 --> 00:04:03.047]  People like Ted Cruz, who used to be, you know, I'm a fiscal conservative, that used to be his thing, I'm a constitutional conservative.
[00:04:03.307 --> 00:04:20.000]   But they're now normalizing and rubbing elbows with open white nationalism, white replacement theory, some really dangerous ideologies that are designed to whip up You know, particularly white men and working class white men, non-college white men.
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:35.984]  What we're seeing here is, under the guise of free speech, a lot of the veneer of kind of respectability that mainstream politicians and mainstream news platforms carry, you have actually now Holocaust minimization happening.
[00:04:36.124 --> 00:04:41.885]  I used to watch some of these ISIS recruitment videos back when I used to do a dayside program.
[00:04:42.365 --> 00:04:45.249]  They were very similar in that they showed lots of action.
[00:04:47.291 --> 00:04:48.172]  Well, there you go.
[00:04:48.232 --> 00:04:50.655]  They're telling you that Tucker Carlson wants to burn books.
[00:04:51.616 --> 00:04:53.758]  They're telling you he's denying the Holocaust.
[00:04:53.778 --> 00:04:57.903]  They're telling you that he's ISIS or Al-Qaeda recruiting videos.
[00:04:59.224 --> 00:04:59.904]  None of that was true.
[00:04:59.924 --> 00:05:00.785]  It was all a lie.
[00:05:00.845 --> 00:05:03.606]  In fact, it's the left opening the borders up to radical Islam.
[00:05:03.666 --> 00:05:06.287]  It's the left that's censoring and cutting everybody's speech.
[00:05:06.768 --> 00:05:17.332]  Parents not wanting their schools that they pay for, their, quote, independent school boards, not wanting critical race theory that white people are inherently evil taught, or they don't want pedophilia taught.
[00:05:17.532 --> 00:05:20.294]  Oh, you mean they don't want child porn in the libraries?
[00:05:20.354 --> 00:05:21.274]  That's not book burning.
[00:05:22.135 --> 00:05:25.016]  That's not letting you pervert pedophiles have access to our children.
[00:05:25.496 --> 00:05:26.557]  Big broadcast lined up.
[00:05:26.657 --> 00:05:27.097]  Stay with us.
[00:05:28.596 --> 00:05:32.037]  It's Friday, October 29th.
[00:05:32.117 --> 00:05:32.857]  The year is 2021.
[00:05:33.057 --> 00:05:35.178]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:05:36.338 --> 00:05:42.300]  Thank you for joining us for another edition of the Embattled InfoWars transmission.
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.641]  Lord willing, we'll be live the next four hours.
[00:05:48.161 --> 00:05:58.490]   All right, let me just as calmly as I can Go over the news and the guests that we're gonna have on the broadcast today.
[00:06:00.051 --> 00:06:01.552]  Well, look right here what I have.
[00:06:02.512 --> 00:06:04.173]  Doctors, remember.
[00:06:06.293 --> 00:06:10.535]  Now, nobody is too young for a heart attack.
[00:06:12.016 --> 00:06:22.960]  These ads are being run on TV, radio, print, on the sides of buses, in Texas, in New York, in Pennsylvania, in California, and suddenly they're running in India?
[00:06:23.835 --> 00:06:27.838]  And Australia, and the UK, and Germany, and everywhere.
[00:06:28.398 --> 00:06:38.045]  Just like Drag Queen Storytime suddenly started five years ago all around the world, funded by a consortium of Fortune 100 corporations, including AT&T.
[00:06:38.065 --> 00:06:46.731]  AT&T, it's out in the news today, is actually going to teach all their employees in a quote, re-education seminars that are mandatory.
[00:06:47.486 --> 00:06:50.167]  That white people are the problem and are inherently evil.
[00:06:50.187 --> 00:06:53.508]  I have the actual copy of the syllabus.
[00:06:56.768 --> 00:06:57.989]  Yes, this is the New World Order.
[00:06:58.029 --> 00:07:01.630]  This is the depopulation operation having us all fight and kill each other.
[00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:05.251]  All the globalists deindustrialize and hit us with bioweapons.
[00:07:06.611 --> 00:07:08.091]  So let me just show you this little stack.
[00:07:08.111 --> 00:07:08.972]  We'll go into this more.
[00:07:09.452 --> 00:07:13.733]  This is just today from all over local newspapers around the country.
[00:07:14.542 --> 00:07:15.862]  Doctors remember.
[00:07:16.302 --> 00:07:17.363]  They're telling you to remember.
[00:07:17.963 --> 00:07:21.964]  Nobody now suddenly is too young for a heart attack.
[00:07:23.544 --> 00:07:27.645]  They say suddenly above 12 year olds have all been having heart attacks all over the Western world.
[00:07:28.406 --> 00:07:34.587]  And they say we don't know why in NPR stories and ABC stories and these others just say it's just a new thing.
[00:07:34.627 --> 00:07:35.548]  Just get used to it.
[00:07:35.568 --> 00:07:37.568]  Oh and strokes and blood clots in the lungs.
[00:07:39.048 --> 00:07:40.609]  But no one knows what it is.
[00:07:43.047 --> 00:07:51.814]  And if you say what it is from the CDC's own documents last October saying, get ready for more heart attacks and blood clots and strokes from the shots, well, you get censored.
[00:07:52.114 --> 00:07:58.158]  And the head of YouTube has been bragging, I have a clip, saying, hey, we censored over a million videos.
[00:07:59.079 --> 00:08:05.224]  These people made a little bit of a cry, a little bit of a yell, a little bit of a, hey, my mom, dad, my brother died, my sister died, my child died.
[00:08:05.524 --> 00:08:06.725]  Hey, they had to cut my leg off.
[00:08:06.765 --> 00:08:07.525]  Hey, I had a stroke.
[00:08:07.565 --> 00:08:08.486]  Hey, I was in great shape.
[00:08:08.806 --> 00:08:09.587]  I was 20 years old.
[00:08:09.627 --> 00:08:10.668]  My job made me take a shot.
[00:08:11.188 --> 00:08:12.169]  And then I had a heart attack.
[00:08:12.955 --> 00:08:18.061]  Hey, you try to talk about it on any platform, Instagram, you name it, you get banned.
[00:08:18.582 --> 00:08:23.928]  Like the young man, the doctor said at college, your athlete had the myocarditis, can't play sports anymore.
[00:08:25.289 --> 00:08:27.752]  They told him, yeah, the Pfizer shot made you have a heart attack.
[00:08:28.593 --> 00:08:34.574]   And the UN was in Was it three weeks ago the UN was in Yahoo News?
[00:08:35.095 --> 00:08:35.535]  The UN?
[00:08:35.575 --> 00:08:37.296]  It said the UN is the fact checker.
[00:08:37.656 --> 00:08:40.117]  It runs the Facebook, Instagram fact check.
[00:08:40.697 --> 00:08:42.659]  He had four and a half million views talking about it.
[00:08:42.699 --> 00:08:52.704]  Sure, after we took him down for it, he got his doctor to go public and say it was caused by the vaccine, but that was banned too, and we're just not going to let you scare people even if what you said was true.
[00:08:53.404 --> 00:08:54.165]  We're the UN.
[00:08:54.925 --> 00:08:56.586]  We're in charge of America.
[00:09:00.842 --> 00:09:08.626]  And yes, there's a lot of top doctors coming out saying they'd pull a healthy children from school before giving them a COVID vaccine, but they're rolling ahead with the five and ups.
[00:09:08.646 --> 00:09:14.029]  So just suddenly, I've got the articles here and the screenshots from around the world.
[00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:17.371]  When I see a screenshot, I just don't believe it.
[00:09:17.651 --> 00:09:20.433]  I went and followed it through on all these and these are indeed everywhere.
[00:09:20.473 --> 00:09:25.436]  In fact, a friend of mine sent me a text from Dallas and it's on the side of the buses there.
[00:09:27.145 --> 00:09:27.725]  But here it is.
[00:09:28.165 --> 00:09:29.045]  Doctors remember.
[00:09:29.125 --> 00:09:31.286]  Now nobody's too young for a heart attack.
[00:09:31.326 --> 00:09:31.706]  Wow!
[00:09:32.046 --> 00:09:33.906]  It's a new and improved wonderful thing.
[00:09:33.926 --> 00:09:36.187]  And what do they report all over the Western world?
[00:09:36.947 --> 00:09:39.728]  Massive increases in heart attacks and blood clots in the young.
[00:09:40.908 --> 00:09:41.008]  Oh!
[00:09:41.968 --> 00:09:45.849]  Spotted in Whitby on Durham Transit.
[00:09:46.549 --> 00:09:47.949]  Are they normalizing this?
[00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:49.630]  What's to come?
[00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:52.350]  And it says kids have strokes too!
[00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:54.531]  Know the warning signs.
[00:09:54.731 --> 00:09:55.411]  Yeah!
[00:09:56.977 --> 00:09:58.097]  Oh, hey, look at this guy, though.
[00:09:58.137 --> 00:09:58.757]  Everything's okay.
[00:09:58.777 --> 00:09:59.678]  This is the Times of India.
[00:10:00.038 --> 00:10:02.418]  Biggest publication in the second most populous country in the world.
[00:10:03.418 --> 00:10:05.479]  Puneet Rajkumar.
[00:10:05.699 --> 00:10:09.139]  Very popular A-list movie star over there in Bollywood.
[00:10:10.219 --> 00:10:14.600]  He got his first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, and then he got his second one recently.
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.821]  And hey, he's doing fine, folks.
[00:10:17.641 --> 00:10:23.522]  Oh, no, he died of a heart attack at 46 years old yesterday.
[00:10:23.722 --> 00:10:24.882]  Oh, but hey.
[00:10:26.246 --> 00:10:27.086]  Too many people, right?
[00:10:27.667 --> 00:10:28.127]  Oh, hey!
[00:10:28.147 --> 00:10:30.168]  How about that top radio host?
[00:10:30.188 --> 00:10:30.888]  He got the shots.
[00:10:30.908 --> 00:10:31.869]  He's dead of heart attack, too.
[00:10:31.889 --> 00:10:33.770]  But that's just yesterday, too.
[00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:34.610]  But hey, no big deal.
[00:10:35.751 --> 00:10:37.632]  Radio legend dies suddenly.
[00:10:37.652 --> 00:10:39.173]  That reads as second shot.
[00:10:40.073 --> 00:10:40.733]  And it goes on.
[00:10:40.773 --> 00:10:42.034]  But hey, let's not listen to that.
[00:10:42.054 --> 00:10:43.175]  That's all just anecdotal.
[00:10:43.835 --> 00:10:46.496]  Let's look at this new article out from ZeroHedge.com.
[00:10:46.837 --> 00:10:53.340]  FDA advisor explains why he abstained from vote on Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for kids.
[00:10:54.352 --> 00:10:57.916]  So I thought, hey, I might want to read his open letter on why he said don't do it.
[00:10:57.936 --> 00:11:05.984]  And he said, well, they don't track in this public study where they said at the board meeting, we're going to legalize it to test it on children as guinea pigs.
[00:11:06.184 --> 00:11:07.586]  We'll never know if it's dangerous or not.
[00:11:07.606 --> 00:11:09.148]  Remember, that's the clip you played a couple of times.
[00:11:09.548 --> 00:11:10.289]  Cue that up if you can.
[00:11:11.196 --> 00:11:14.859]  FDA board member said, I'm voting yes because I want to see if this hurts people or not.
[00:11:15.259 --> 00:11:16.440]  Wow, what an amazing statement.
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:19.562]  But see, oh, when I saw that, I said, there's something to that.
[00:11:20.102 --> 00:11:21.163]  Uh-huh.
[00:11:21.623 --> 00:11:25.126]  They're not tracking the children after the injections.
[00:11:26.206 --> 00:11:28.208]  Even in their fake studies they've been running.
[00:11:29.408 --> 00:11:32.771]  It says right here they only follow it after the injection for three months.
[00:11:35.252 --> 00:11:40.516]  As those sweet little protein crystals start nesting in the lungs and the heart and the arteries and the brain.
[00:11:43.993 --> 00:11:44.954]  Yep, there it is on screen.
[00:11:44.974 --> 00:11:47.115]  Yeah, cue it up and let me know when you have the audio ready, we'll play it.
[00:11:47.195 --> 00:11:52.098]  I don't want to just say things here on air in case new listeners are driving on the highway, they think, oh, this guy just says this.
[00:11:52.358 --> 00:11:54.299]  I heard about, I heard about this guy.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.020]  He's Alex Jones.
[00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:57.541]  He's that guy you can't trust.
[00:11:57.982 --> 00:12:01.023]  He's that guy that is so incredibly deceptive.
[00:12:02.865 --> 00:12:07.988]  Here is the FDA board member, Dr. Ding Dong or whatever his name, here it is.
[00:12:09.489 --> 00:12:14.369]   And I think what swings me here is that It's a very sort of personal choice.
[00:12:14.569 --> 00:12:21.200]  If I had a child who was a transplant recipient, I would really want to be able to use a vaccine like this.
[00:12:21.741 --> 00:12:25.147]  And there are certainly kids who probably should be vaccinated.
[00:12:26.559 --> 00:12:53.610]   The question of how broadly to use it, though, I think is a substantial one, and I know it's not our question, and I know we're kind of pumping that to ACIP, but I do think that it's a relatively close call, and as Dr. Levy just said, as Dr. Gann said, It really is going to be a question of what the prevailing conditions are, but we're never going to learn about how safe the vaccine is unless we start getting it.
[00:12:54.431 --> 00:12:55.551]  That's just the way it goes.
[00:12:55.591 --> 00:13:01.894]  That's how we found out about rare complications of other vaccines.
[00:13:02.014 --> 00:13:06.477]  I do think that we are going to, I do think we should vote to approve it.
[00:13:07.137 --> 00:13:07.677]  Okay.
[00:13:07.777 --> 00:13:09.038]  So that's Dr. Eric Rubin.
[00:13:09.058 --> 00:13:09.618]  Thank you.
[00:13:10.899 --> 00:13:21.168]   But the board member that voted against it said, That this could be dangerous, and that it's not been tested properly, and they're not going to even do follow-ups in the actual studies, much less the general public, but for three months.
[00:13:23.008 --> 00:13:26.870]  Kind of important little tidbit for you, but oh, let's just move on.
[00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:29.511]  Yeah, so Apple runs death camps.
[00:13:29.551 --> 00:13:30.651]  They're liberal, it's alright.
[00:13:30.751 --> 00:13:42.369]   So, Pfizer's advising governments to lock healthy people up during the next pandemic to, quote, protect them, and have drones deliver their food, but That's okay, because they're liberal, right?
[00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:44.171]  None of them are liberal, folks.
[00:13:44.211 --> 00:13:51.277]  They're fascistic, evil, technocracy taking over our planet.
[00:13:51.297 --> 00:13:57.543]  But how amazing is that, that when these people die, they don't tell you that, oh, they had the shot first.
[00:13:57.883 --> 00:13:59.985]  You got to go to their Twitter to find them bragging about it.
[00:14:01.975 --> 00:14:02.855]  Oh, and who else died?
[00:14:03.216 --> 00:14:11.879]  The main spokesperson for vaccines in India, who was 50-something years old, and by the way, was a sports guy, but he was also a movie star, he was even bigger than this last guy that died.
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:19.543]  And he died the day after he took the shot from a big old fat juicy heart attack.
[00:14:20.443 --> 00:14:24.565]  Which, they tell you in the CDC's own documents, they predicted what happened last October.
[00:14:24.585 --> 00:14:27.006]  Because they'd already seen what was happening in the UK.
[00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:33.023]  And the British government ignored the military and their own advisory group that said, jam on the brakes.
[00:14:34.144 --> 00:14:37.846]  Remember, even the Yahoo headline was, don't give this to three groups, says British Advisory Board.
[00:14:37.866 --> 00:14:40.228]  Above 75, below 16, and pregnant.
[00:14:44.432 --> 00:14:50.435]  But they're full steam ahead and just normalizing nasty population.
[00:14:50.996 --> 00:14:52.516]  All right, I haven't even scratched the surface.
[00:14:52.536 --> 00:14:53.377]  You think that's big?
[00:14:54.197 --> 00:14:56.318]  Oh, wait till we come back.
[00:14:56.979 --> 00:15:00.140]  This is a war we're in.
[00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:00.981]  So remember that.
[00:15:01.021 --> 00:15:01.821]  It's an info war.
[00:15:01.861 --> 00:15:02.842]  Tell everybody tune in now.
[00:15:03.922 --> 00:15:08.745]  So now there is a new phenomenon across the United States and in Europe and Australia.
[00:15:08.805 --> 00:15:11.026]  It's all funded by the big corporations.
[00:15:11.046 --> 00:15:12.627]  I have all the articles coming up next segment.
[00:15:14.392 --> 00:15:22.317]  To have drag queen time in the middle schools and the high schools where the young men and boys dress up as women.
[00:15:23.237 --> 00:15:32.860]  And then pretend to be prostitutes having sex with male members of the staff while they all wear pink and other similar things.
[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:37.602]  So this is what we're teaching under corporate funding.
[00:15:38.202 --> 00:15:43.803]  This is what's going on while the Communist Chinese fire live ammunition at each other in their military drills.
[00:15:44.544 --> 00:15:45.204]  That is coming up.
[00:15:45.324 --> 00:16:08.915]   The reason I raise this, and we'll get to all this coming up next segment, is that Whether it's banners on the side of buses all over the world, where the Moderna-Pfizer shots are being given, or whether it's pedophile story time, it's all the big corporations funding this, chief amongst them Apple and other companies like AT&T.
[00:16:09.135 --> 00:16:11.057]  And again, they're in the news here today doing that.
[00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:23.557]  AT&T, the article's on Infowars.com, teaching critical race theory and saying that, quote, whiteness is inherently bad and that white people are the root of problems and that white Americans are uniquely bad.
[00:16:24.137 --> 00:16:24.678]  That's a quote.
[00:16:25.318 --> 00:16:26.479]  Uniquely bad.
[00:16:29.981 --> 00:16:40.707]  And I love how Twitter and Facebook and everybody will ban you if you show the actual 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 year olds humping on other males and people, period.
[00:16:42.153 --> 00:16:44.656]  But we're supposed to blur it all out to show you what they're doing to the children.
[00:16:44.676 --> 00:16:49.641]  Like, oh, don't show the book that the middle school has that shows children having sex with adults.
[00:16:50.082 --> 00:16:50.842]  You can't show that.
[00:16:50.902 --> 00:16:51.904]  That's child porn.
[00:16:52.224 --> 00:16:53.685]  That can only be shown to children.
[00:16:55.467 --> 00:16:57.650]  There's the article, AT&T's racial...
[00:16:58.658 --> 00:17:03.882]  Re-education program, by the way, that's in quotes, that's their term, asserts white people are the problem.
[00:17:04.163 --> 00:17:07.145]  In fact, I got so many articles here, I couldn't find that in my stack a minute ago.
[00:17:07.165 --> 00:17:10.828]  Will you guys please reprint me that so I can cover it with this other stack next segment?
[00:17:10.848 --> 00:17:12.670]  But I'm just mentioning now what's coming up.
[00:17:13.431 --> 00:17:16.273]  Then this all dovetails together with the collapse of the border.
[00:17:18.355 --> 00:17:20.597]  It's true, it's been proposed, it's in the legislation.
[00:17:23.959 --> 00:17:44.491]  Plus, if you round up, $500,000 a piece for anyone who claims they were separated from their child, even though they're on record most of the time having kidnapped children that people use to get across the border and to be turned loose in the U.S., and then they give the children back to smugglers, coyotes, who then bring them back into Mexico over and over again.
[00:17:45.171 --> 00:17:46.132]  That's all confirmed.
[00:17:46.952 --> 00:17:48.133]  But none of that gets investigated.
[00:17:48.153 --> 00:17:49.293]  None of the child smuggling gets stopped.
[00:17:49.774 --> 00:17:51.995]  So now, it's being proposed.
[00:17:53.186 --> 00:17:53.446]  U.S.
[00:17:53.506 --> 00:17:59.390]  in talks with hundreds of millions to pay hundreds of millions to families separated at border.
[00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:00.631]  Wall Street Journal.
[00:18:00.991 --> 00:18:05.114]  Family members separated at border to get $450,000 under this plan.
[00:18:05.194 --> 00:18:11.018]  And if you wonder why there's giant hordes of people flooding this way, that's what's happening.
[00:18:11.038 --> 00:18:13.019]  I'm gonna give you the rest of the story behind this.
[00:18:14.252 --> 00:18:28.262]  Coming up as well, because I haven't even scratched the surface of that for you yet, but I will be doing it because you don't think they're actually giving that $450,000 plus to each one of these individuals.
[00:18:28.403 --> 00:18:28.623]  No.
[00:18:30.404 --> 00:18:32.806]  I know this because I've seen it in Austin and San Antonio.
[00:18:33.506 --> 00:18:34.607]  I'm born here in Texas.
[00:18:34.667 --> 00:18:40.832]  I've watched this with county and city officials that have been busted and arrested for it, but never gets much attention.
[00:18:41.556 --> 00:18:53.469]  A lot of them have dungeons buried usually as basements under their houses that they have actually built, because the average Texas house is in a basement, where they keep prisoners that they've smuggled in to shake more money out of their families around the country.
[00:18:54.870 --> 00:19:03.480]  And what they do is, while they're exploiting these people for slave labor and sweatshops, is they skim the welfare they sign them up for about half the money they get.
[00:19:04.167 --> 00:19:15.836]  And they also sign them up for tax refunds and things like that, and they'll have examples of one house in Austin had over a billion dollars in tax refunds sent to it one year alone, and no criminal investigation was launched under Obama.
[00:19:16.257 --> 00:19:17.918]  See, I said I'd cover the next segment, I'm doing it now.
[00:19:18.939 --> 00:19:34.798]   They use these people as cutouts, as mules, not to haul in heroin or fentanyl or cocaine, but to haul in themselves to be signed up in the social safety net to then Hey, that money into the Democratic Party and into the different criminal syndicates.
[00:19:35.258 --> 00:19:38.279]  So they're not going to give $50,000 to these people.
[00:19:38.899 --> 00:19:45.060]  They're going to give almost $500,000 to them that is then paid directly into a quote, local bank.
[00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:46.580]  And then there it disappears.
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:48.561]  And the FBI will do nothing.
[00:19:48.601 --> 00:19:49.641]  They are blocked from doing it.
[00:19:49.661 --> 00:19:50.561]  They're heavily involved.
[00:19:50.601 --> 00:19:55.562]  A lot of them at the higher ups, the low level FBI is not involved, but the higher ups are running it.
[00:19:56.658 --> 00:20:01.520]  So that's why you got the smugglers, you know, dropping the babies over the top and doing all the rest of it.
[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:04.360]  And then they've got an ID that matches that with the child.
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:09.802]  Later, they show up and say, hey, I want my $450,000 as I drop my baby off over the thing.
[00:20:09.822 --> 00:20:13.863]  And then, you know, found out where they were in the database and came back and got them six months later.
[00:20:14.223 --> 00:20:14.964]  I've been abused.
[00:20:15.004 --> 00:20:15.364]  Give me that.
[00:20:16.144 --> 00:20:17.544]  Give me that half a million right now.
[00:20:17.624 --> 00:20:18.585]  So that's coming up next segment.
[00:20:18.605 --> 00:20:24.206]  And then we've got what's happening in the economy and with the supply chain, we've got a lot of big developments on that front.
[00:20:24.567 --> 00:20:25.647]  That's what I'm going to hit first.
[00:20:27.091 --> 00:20:28.112]  Right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:20:29.373 --> 00:20:42.964]  When I told you 20 months ago that the shutdown of the third world under an ongoing lockdown in many areas of Africa and Latin America would cause hundreds of millions to start starving in the next few years, hundreds of millions would then finally starve.
[00:20:43.385 --> 00:20:48.509]  The last number the UN said is 25 million extra died the last year and a half from the lockdown, not from the virus.
[00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:50.791]  Just a nonchalant 25 million.
[00:20:52.648 --> 00:20:53.570]  That number's months old.
[00:20:54.531 --> 00:21:02.525]  And those that have the money, those that are upper middle class in those countries, which means, you know, they make $50 a day or so, not $50 a year.
[00:21:03.045 --> 00:21:04.408]  They're all on their way up here.
[00:21:06.275 --> 00:21:14.702]  Along with criminals and rabble and people that are also handicapped who want to be, quote, taken care of to weigh down the system and bankrupt it according to the globalist plan.
[00:21:15.002 --> 00:21:19.726]  That's why Soros has his DAs all over the country releasing armed robbers.
[00:21:19.786 --> 00:21:23.889]  And that guy up by Dallas in a liberal jurisdiction shot three people.
[00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:28.733]  But I guess because they were white and he was black, they released him two hours later.
[00:21:28.753 --> 00:21:29.974]  They're still in the hospital.
[00:21:30.763 --> 00:21:32.904]  And they said, well, they got bullied, but it wasn't even true.
[00:21:32.924 --> 00:21:33.844]  He just shot three people.
[00:21:34.484 --> 00:21:38.526]  That's all just to have culture and everything just unravel and totally collapse.
[00:21:39.966 --> 00:21:41.227]  So that's the current operation.
[00:21:41.247 --> 00:21:44.388]  That's the current plan that we're dealing with.
[00:21:44.748 --> 00:21:51.330]  And so I've got a big stack of articles I'll get to next hour dealing with the fact that the supply chain is totally breaking down.
[00:21:52.177 --> 00:21:55.883]  And only about 80% of packages across the board are getting delivered right now.
[00:21:56.684 --> 00:22:02.813]  There's just mass breakdowns of the drivers, mass breakdowns at FedEx, Amazon, USPS, everything.
[00:22:02.873 --> 00:22:04.255]  It looks like FedEx is the worst.
[00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:06.040]  And this is where we are.
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:14.103]  So it's going to just get more insane towards Christmas into next year when the hospitals are full of the dead and dying from the vaccine reactions and the A.D.E.
[00:22:14.723 --> 00:22:15.123]  and more.
[00:22:15.203 --> 00:22:22.766]  So I would tell you to support InfoWars, but also stock up on things you need, like high quality, swearable food ready to ship to you right now, prices.
[00:22:23.386 --> 00:22:26.828]  Our 10% off right now for Black Friday comes early for the next two weeks.
[00:22:26.888 --> 00:22:27.889]  Our special sale every year.
[00:22:27.909 --> 00:22:43.497]  We have store-bought free shipping, double Patriot points, bone broth, ultimate bone broth, plus is now back in with the chaga mushroom, the bee pollen, the really strong turmeric, and the best concentrated chicken bone broth protein.
[00:22:43.537 --> 00:22:47.219]  It's so amazing for your bones, your guts, your joints, your body.
[00:22:47.239 --> 00:22:50.181]  It's just incredible what it does for your immune system and so much more.
[00:22:51.667 --> 00:22:54.089]  Chicken soup, you know, for when you're sick, take it to the next level.
[00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:56.851]  And so it's reformulated back even better.
[00:22:57.492 --> 00:22:59.833]  And it is discounted with free shipping as well.
[00:22:59.913 --> 00:23:05.698]  Brain Force Plus, the amazing nootropic pill, is back in stock, being sold out close to eight months.
[00:23:06.138 --> 00:23:07.319]  It's 50% off.
[00:23:07.439 --> 00:23:11.482]  Ultra 12, incredibly high quality, out of the V12, take it under the tongue, supercharge you as well.
[00:23:11.803 --> 00:23:12.883]  It's 60% off.
[00:23:13.264 --> 00:23:17.647]  And these sales are going to last for two weeks or while supplies of the products last.
[00:23:18.068 --> 00:23:19.128]  And that's what keeps us on air.
[00:23:19.168 --> 00:23:22.624]   So I would get Stocked up on these products and do your Christmas shopping now.
[00:23:24.386 --> 00:23:29.612]  All right, I just got some new information laid on me from the World Economic Forum that is huge.
[00:23:30.312 --> 00:23:34.497]  And I confirmed it, but I'm going to get even more evidence of it and cover it at the start of the next hour.
[00:23:35.097 --> 00:23:35.998]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:40.963]  But they're not just planning to put nanoparticles in the vaccines.
[00:23:41.844 --> 00:23:43.266]  And we knew this for a long time.
[00:23:44.611 --> 00:23:46.372]  So I'll be getting to that next hour.
[00:23:46.392 --> 00:23:47.492]  You can probably make a guess.
[00:23:48.153 --> 00:23:58.317]  You know, Gates has been developing vaccines that quote grow biological live vaccines that grow in strawberries, that grow in cherries, that grow in bananas.
[00:24:01.583 --> 00:24:02.343]  Print me some more on that.
[00:24:02.363 --> 00:24:06.145]  I'm going to cover that next hour because they're going ahead with it.
[00:24:09.246 --> 00:24:13.647]  You don't just think Peter Daszak wanted to spray nanoparticles in caves in China.
[00:24:13.688 --> 00:24:15.928]  You don't think Fauci was going to stop there.
[00:24:17.189 --> 00:24:19.270]  See, people keep saying, man, they've gone for broke.
[00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:23.611]  The hospitals are full of people dying of heart attacks and strokes, including young people that are taking the shots.
[00:24:24.231 --> 00:24:25.232]  They'll never get away with this.
[00:24:25.352 --> 00:24:25.832]  Yeah, they will.
[00:24:27.557 --> 00:24:34.959]  Because they're gonna launch something far worse, and you'll forget about all this death, and you'll think back on this as a very fond time.
[00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:44.482]  And meanwhile, they've got velociraptors in their propaganda pieces at the UN telling you not to have children.
[00:24:46.262 --> 00:24:46.982]  To save the Earth.
[00:24:47.302 --> 00:24:49.323]  Do not go extinct!
[00:24:49.423 --> 00:24:50.363]  Do not have children!
[00:24:50.763 --> 00:24:51.543]  Take your shots!
[00:24:51.604 --> 00:24:52.464]  Do not go extinct!
[00:24:52.624 --> 00:24:53.124]  I love you!
[00:24:54.068 --> 00:24:57.871]  It's all just surreal, blurring reality with unreality.
[00:24:59.032 --> 00:25:03.435]  And for people that are in a trance, they don't know what they have been hit by.
[00:25:04.456 --> 00:25:04.896]  Okay.
[00:25:07.338 --> 00:25:19.427]  Let's go ahead and start drilling into the next big piece of news that I was getting to earlier that I was alluding to.
[00:25:21.588 --> 00:25:22.189]  Let's do that.
[00:25:23.832 --> 00:25:24.312]  Right now.
[00:25:24.712 --> 00:25:28.034]  And radio listeners are going to be spared from having to watch this.
[00:25:28.914 --> 00:25:31.695]  And for adults, it's just humiliating.
[00:25:32.435 --> 00:25:36.517]  It's sad to see what they've turned our young men into and what's going on around the country.
[00:25:36.557 --> 00:25:51.543]  But they are now having not just drag queen story times for your 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10-year-olds at the schools, in some cases, like the case of Denver, Colorado, unannounced to the parents, who are disgusting-looking men dressed up in clown outfits.
[00:25:53.482 --> 00:25:57.365]  Show up and have your children sit on their laps while they have erections bulging in their pants.
[00:25:58.106 --> 00:25:59.366]  Well, now that's not enough.
[00:26:00.487 --> 00:26:12.376]  Now, in Kentucky, and this is happening other places, high school principal who got lap dance from student, it's on video, was also fondled by boy during drag show.
[00:26:13.277 --> 00:26:13.717]  That's right.
[00:26:14.158 --> 00:26:21.103]  Had his chest and neck and crotch grabbed like you're in the champagne room at the local topless bar.
[00:26:22.398 --> 00:26:28.200]  You can say what you want about those places, you know, they're of age, it's their choice to do it.
[00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:33.521]  You know, the church can tell you that's bad and it probably is a destructive lifestyle, sure, but I'm not stopping people from that.
[00:26:33.841 --> 00:26:34.581]  That's their choice.
[00:26:34.901 --> 00:26:36.242]  But this is just pure evil.
[00:26:37.022 --> 00:26:38.362]  And this is where it's all going.
[00:26:39.223 --> 00:26:46.015]   And then a man dresses a woman with a wig, wearing a mask, Talk about cult programming.
[00:26:46.536 --> 00:26:51.180]  Running up, groping on other males, other boys who try to get away from it.
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:56.845]  So now, sexual assault by a male on a male you see is cute in the gay world, right?
[00:26:57.266 --> 00:27:03.992]  That's why you have the James Bond actor saying, I like going to gay bars because heterosexual bars are so rude and bad and full of rape.
[00:27:04.012 --> 00:27:05.693]  Of course, statistically, it's the opposite.
[00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:09.741]  That's how this works.
[00:27:10.201 --> 00:27:15.442]  And let's show the photos of the lap dances and twerking going on.
[00:27:16.742 --> 00:27:17.942]  Also, here's some photos of that.
[00:27:20.503 --> 00:27:28.445]  With male students with their shaved legs and everything, humping on the teacher and giving them a lap dance, caressing their body.
[00:27:28.485 --> 00:27:34.806]  And the coach getting up and simulating anal sex with the young man.
[00:27:35.751 --> 00:27:37.052]  Who's wearing fishnet stockings?
[00:27:37.953 --> 00:27:41.497]  Imagine the CHICOMs must really be proud of the propaganda they put into our country.
[00:27:41.557 --> 00:27:41.817]  Wow.
[00:27:42.738 --> 00:27:43.920]  And there's a report breaking.
[00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:51.828]  Investigation underway after Kentucky high school hosts drag pageant featuring male teens in lingerie giving lap dances to staff.
[00:27:52.705 --> 00:27:55.767]  The sexualization of children, I don't care if it's heterosexual or homosexual, it's wrong.
[00:27:56.107 --> 00:28:02.390]  Here's photos of the groping of the stomach, and then down to the groin area.
[00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:12.875]  And again, bumping the buttocks into the, through the pants, onto the male genitals of the principal, the coach, humping the coach.
[00:28:15.257 --> 00:28:16.297]  Paul Watson did a report on it.
[00:28:16.397 --> 00:28:19.019]  Sick high school allows kids to perform lap dances for teachers.
[00:28:19.039 --> 00:28:21.700]  They don't allow it, they promote it, and they push it.
[00:28:22.438 --> 00:28:24.299]  Meanwhile, the real targeting is this.
[00:28:25.439 --> 00:28:26.179]  This is out of K-12.
[00:28:26.219 --> 00:28:28.420]  This is out of the local news.
[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:33.981]  Several Baltimore schools report zero students proficient in math.
[00:28:34.822 --> 00:28:44.484]  After two years ago, the state of Maryland lowered its proficiency test to that of, what, an 80 IQ person who's instructed to be able to pass.
[00:28:44.524 --> 00:28:46.705]  So there you go.
[00:28:47.648 --> 00:28:48.988]  And there won't be any math training now.
[00:28:49.008 --> 00:28:53.150]  It'll all be on critical race theory and what the evil white people did to you.
[00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:55.650]  But it is evil white people and black people.
[00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:58.671]  It's the globalists that are helping do this to you.
[00:28:58.691 --> 00:29:01.092]  So you'll be in a prison of ignorance your whole life.
[00:29:01.112 --> 00:29:02.012]  But oh, it gets better.
[00:29:02.032 --> 00:29:06.514]  This is not the Babylon Bee.
[00:29:06.534 --> 00:29:07.434]  This is not the onion.
[00:29:08.832 --> 00:29:09.993]  This is not a joke.
[00:29:10.053 --> 00:29:10.493]  It's real.
[00:29:10.593 --> 00:29:16.597]  A lesbian dating app is being overrun by trans women and the clown world just keeps spinning.
[00:29:16.637 --> 00:29:17.237]  And guess what?
[00:29:17.597 --> 00:29:19.218]  They all announced they are lesbians.
[00:29:19.579 --> 00:29:21.360]  It's the old joke of, well, you know, I'm not against women.
[00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:22.100]  I'm like, women, I get it.
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:24.982]  I'm a lesbian, you know, in my heart as well.
[00:29:25.642 --> 00:29:33.447]  Well, this is disgusting looking men dressed up in like Benny Hill clown outfits seeking relationships with women.
[00:29:33.467 --> 00:29:40.312]   And these are men with their penises who want to have intercourse With women, kind of like two women in prison can have a baby.
[00:29:40.832 --> 00:29:48.177]  And you can go see the Freak Show, that's what it is, in the article if you've got the nerve to actually look at this.
[00:29:48.998 --> 00:29:50.379]  But a lot of them have beards.
[00:29:50.399 --> 00:29:52.220]  A lot of them have beards.
[00:29:53.501 --> 00:29:54.702]  And they are lesbians.
[00:29:55.783 --> 00:29:56.363]  And they're ready.
[00:29:56.523 --> 00:29:59.826]  Oh, look, this is a lovely young maiden here for you.
[00:29:59.846 --> 00:30:04.529]  And don't talk bad about them or you'll be taken off everywhere you'll... Oh, I like this.
[00:30:04.829 --> 00:30:05.770]  I better be honest with you.
[00:30:06.893 --> 00:30:14.557]  I'm not usually for transvestites and stuff, but this one here, this is, uh... Oh, and you see the symbol they've got here.
[00:30:14.577 --> 00:30:15.838]  You know what that symbol is right there?
[00:30:17.439 --> 00:30:17.639]  Yeah.
[00:30:18.139 --> 00:30:19.300]  These symbols all mean something.
[00:30:20.661 --> 00:30:20.801]  Yeah.
[00:30:22.042 --> 00:30:24.083]  So, uh, there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:30:24.103 --> 00:30:25.263]  This is not a joke.
[00:30:26.044 --> 00:30:26.804]  This is real.
[00:30:26.984 --> 00:30:29.826]  This is happening, and we can laugh at it all day, but it's not funny.
[00:30:30.266 --> 00:30:34.108]  Because when parents try to do something about it, this is what happens.
[00:30:34.128 --> 00:30:35.229]  In fact, cue up the audio, please.
[00:30:36.708 --> 00:30:41.049]  Well, we don't have time now because the full audio is what the parent had to say that was quite eloquent.
[00:30:42.249 --> 00:30:44.570]  And then the school board member just says, F you.
[00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:48.151]  And if you don't like it, we'll call the FBI in.
[00:30:48.571 --> 00:30:49.231]  I'm not joking.
[00:30:49.271 --> 00:31:00.800]   School board president caught on hot mic saying F you to concerned parent who politely tells them they don't want critical race theory or pedophilia taught to their children, which is the You don't get reading, writing, arithmetic.
[00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:09.943]  You now get antifa, communist tactics, how to be a pedophile, how to be abused by a pedophile, and of course, how to hate white people, and how to commit suicide if you're white.
[00:31:10.363 --> 00:31:13.664]  And then, of course, we've got these little tidbits of news here.
[00:31:14.264 --> 00:31:17.825]  AT&T's racial re-education program.
[00:31:18.045 --> 00:31:19.425]  Again, that's a Soviet term.
[00:31:20.025 --> 00:31:24.006]  Back ten years ago, we got a secret document from the army of Obama sitting at re-education camps.
[00:31:24.346 --> 00:31:27.707]  People thought it was fake until a year later, the army released it officially and said, no, it's real.
[00:31:29.122 --> 00:31:31.103]  And it said you'll be sent for re-education.
[00:31:31.123 --> 00:31:32.243]  That's a Soviet term.
[00:31:32.703 --> 00:31:35.825]  And AT&T's official documents are public, that they're now using.
[00:31:36.285 --> 00:31:44.968]  And there's actually a directive, a letter by the CEO saying, we must admit that whites are inherently a bad group, a bad species of human.
[00:31:45.228 --> 00:31:46.689]  This is truly Hitlerian.
[00:31:46.709 --> 00:31:48.909]  You know, Hitler said certain groups were inherently bad.
[00:31:49.610 --> 00:31:52.131]  And you're like, but that's insane.
[00:31:52.171 --> 00:31:53.631]  That goes against all common sense.
[00:31:53.871 --> 00:31:55.312]  That's the opposite of a liberal view.
[00:31:55.332 --> 00:31:58.113]  Yeah, the big corporations don't like liberalism.
[00:31:59.278 --> 00:32:04.161]  Less taxes, more personal freedom, a religious freedom, you know, do what you want as long as you don't hurt somebody.
[00:32:04.402 --> 00:32:06.843]  They're going to get rid of all that with all this extremism.
[00:32:08.204 --> 00:32:09.865]  And then a real tyranny is going to be in place.
[00:32:09.885 --> 00:32:12.727]  This is how you discredit classical liberalism.
[00:32:13.068 --> 00:32:14.709]  I'm a classical liberal.
[00:32:14.749 --> 00:32:17.030]  250 years ago, I'd be considered classical liberal.
[00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:17.971]  I agree with Thomas Jefferson.
[00:32:18.562 --> 00:32:19.363]  Not today, man.
[00:32:19.463 --> 00:32:26.349]  I'm the Nazi, you see, because I don't want to do medical experiments on black children and kill them like Fauci was doing into the 2000s.
[00:32:26.649 --> 00:32:27.991]  And I got mainstream news on that.
[00:32:28.431 --> 00:32:30.393]  Next segment, we'll play the video.
[00:32:32.254 --> 00:32:32.715]  That's right.
[00:32:32.755 --> 00:32:38.020]  Let me tell you, when you see these liberal lawyers, these liberal politicians, these liberal people, they're in on it, including the black ones.
[00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:40.822]  They hate black people and they want to kill you.
[00:32:41.343 --> 00:32:41.963]  So wake up.
[00:32:42.063 --> 00:32:42.664]  We'll be right back.
[00:32:44.287 --> 00:32:47.009]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[00:32:47.409 --> 00:32:48.770]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:32:49.710 --> 00:33:00.816]  Okay, this has been talked a lot about in the past, 25 years ago, 20 years ago on my show, but I have basically not talked about it in a long time.
[00:33:00.876 --> 00:33:11.982]  And so a few weeks ago, I began to point out, because listeners reminded me, they said, hey, have you heard about Fauci testing HIV drugs that were experimental on kids, some of which didn't even have HIV and killing them.
[00:33:12.022 --> 00:33:13.403]  And I was like, oh my gosh.
[00:33:14.173 --> 00:33:15.314]  I totally forgot about that.
[00:33:15.334 --> 00:33:17.696]  I mean, he's committed so many damn crimes.
[00:33:18.296 --> 00:33:19.877]  It's just, it makes your head spin.
[00:33:22.579 --> 00:33:25.061]  And so then I started digging back into it.
[00:33:25.702 --> 00:33:32.647]  And I mean, Wall Street Journal, New York Times, LA Times, Time Magazine, Newsweek, you know, back when they did some decent reportage.
[00:33:33.508 --> 00:33:38.452]  And then I started doing more research, remembering all the doctors I had on, and it was far worse than they were saying.
[00:33:40.513 --> 00:33:42.795]  I mean, they would go into black families particularly.
[00:33:44.617 --> 00:33:47.159]  And say, again, we're going to take your seven-year-old.
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:51.502]  If you don't give us the seven-year-old and sign the papers, we're going to take the three-year-old.
[00:33:52.423 --> 00:33:55.105]  And the mothers would sign them over to protect the baby.
[00:33:56.466 --> 00:33:59.228]  And then it would describe how they would then kill the children.
[00:33:59.248 --> 00:34:03.551]  And I remember reading about this one particular young boy who fought for a year before they killed him.
[00:34:04.672 --> 00:34:09.396]  And he weighed like some ridiculously low, like 45 pounds or something when he died.
[00:34:09.436 --> 00:34:10.837]  He'd been like 100 pounds when they got him.
[00:34:11.998 --> 00:34:14.072]   I mean, And then here's what happened.
[00:34:14.092 --> 00:34:23.554]  I went back and found that same child last night and it just made me so angry and made me say, how much of this are we going to take?
[00:34:25.215 --> 00:34:29.535]  Because now it's not just going to be poor black children and poor white children in Appalachia.
[00:34:29.555 --> 00:34:30.176]  They did this too.
[00:34:30.216 --> 00:34:31.216]  They did this to whites too.
[00:34:31.236 --> 00:34:32.336]  Anybody poor they could get.
[00:34:32.356 --> 00:34:34.737]  They're going after all our children now.
[00:34:34.757 --> 00:34:35.957]  Are we going to sit here and take this?
[00:34:38.097 --> 00:34:38.297]  No.
[00:34:38.597 --> 00:34:41.418]  Now they're going to blow up their own buildings, their own facilities.
[00:34:42.608 --> 00:34:45.271]  They'll probably bomb themselves, Pfizer or something, to be the victim.
[00:34:45.772 --> 00:34:46.813]  We're not calling for that.
[00:34:47.353 --> 00:34:51.258]  But we do want to get control of our cities and our courts and our systems like Soros has done.
[00:34:51.278 --> 00:34:53.600]  We want to get back control and indict them all.
[00:34:56.043 --> 00:35:00.868]  But when they come with contact tracers trying to take you away and forcefully inject you, you know, at that point it's self-defense.
[00:35:01.129 --> 00:35:03.972]  And that's what's happening is they're forcing us into a fight.
[00:35:05.043 --> 00:35:20.875]  So, RFK Jr., he's a great patriot, has come out and detailed in a long report, it's linked up on Infowars.com, in a Kellan McBreen article, but I'm just going to play a short excerpt, but there's a big report he put out and a long dissertation on it, and I suggest you go watch it.
[00:35:20.935 --> 00:35:22.696]  He's just laying out the same stuff I'm laying out.
[00:35:24.958 --> 00:35:25.558]  RFK Jr.
[00:35:25.578 --> 00:35:33.224]  details racist and sadistic Fauci funding research on grafting aborted baby scalps onto rats.
[00:35:34.082 --> 00:35:40.005]  But it went further, including killing young children with experimental drugs knowingly.
[00:35:43.087 --> 00:35:46.508]  And here's a Don Salazar article from two days ago that really needs to get out.
[00:35:46.648 --> 00:35:53.292]  Not only did Fauci's NIAID harm dogs, foster children also died during AIDS drug research that were totally healthy.
[00:35:57.314 --> 00:36:00.171]   And All I can say is this is next level evil.
[00:36:00.512 --> 00:36:02.894]  By the way, you know, Australia is the test bed of what's coming here.
[00:36:02.934 --> 00:36:10.259]  They admit that all you in run Daily Mail reports unpaid COVID fines will be taken from bank accounts and homes will be seized in Queensland.
[00:36:14.823 --> 00:36:20.087]  And I've got so much more here for you, but let's go ahead and play a little clip of RFK Jr.
[00:36:20.127 --> 00:36:20.828]  talking about this.
[00:36:21.528 --> 00:36:30.593]   Millions of dollars, not only on a few experiments, but many, many other very Almost sadistic.
[00:36:31.553 --> 00:36:34.195]  Not almost, but extremely sadistic.
[00:36:34.395 --> 00:37:13.266]   Another one of the experiments that I talked about in my book is that he was taking scalps from fetuses, from fully developed fetuses, and removing the scalps from the skin from the top of the heads of fetuses, and Transplanting it onto humanized rats in order to test hair sprays and shampoos and those kind of things.
[00:37:13.646 --> 00:37:21.713]  The thing I think people need to talk about, think about, is they were spending millions of dollars on these experiments.
[00:37:22.934 --> 00:37:33.231]   And with all of the desperate needs for public health in this And all of the good that that kind of money could have done.
[00:37:34.771 --> 00:37:39.654]  He shows these experiments as the best use of taxpayers, of course.
[00:37:40.794 --> 00:37:42.735]  And it's really kind of frightening.
[00:37:43.115 --> 00:37:49.718]  Those experiments are described in one of my chapters, an early chapter, which I call Dr. Fauci, Mr. Hyde.
[00:37:54.668 --> 00:37:59.510]  And the much more disturbing parts of that chapter are his experiments on children.
[00:38:00.331 --> 00:38:00.531]  Yeah.
[00:38:00.751 --> 00:38:23.062]  He wasn't just experimenting doing these really horrifically sedentary treatment experiments on animals on behalf of pharmaceutical companies, but he had also arranged to essentially take over foster care homes in 70s days, including one in New York.
[00:38:24.268 --> 00:38:38.600]  Um, called, uh, Incarnation House, where they were taking black and Hispanic children who did not have parents, whose, you know, parents had disappeared and they turned into foster care.
[00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:46.666]  And they had taken over one foster care hospital in New York and essentially turned it over to the drug companies.
[00:38:48.047 --> 00:38:52.469]  And that doesn't matter because they were experimental, things like AZT.
[00:38:52.490 --> 00:38:55.231]  So let that sink in, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:38:55.211 --> 00:38:59.211]  out many of these children did not have a test.
[00:38:59.211 --> 00:39:05.771]   And that doesn't matter because they were experimental things like AZT.
[00:39:05.771 --> 00:39:09.130]  So let that sink in, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:14.491]   I've got a whole other stack in this area, but I'm going to get to that later if I
[00:39:14.491 --> 00:39:18.211]   have time and a bunch of other deaths caused from the so-called vaccines.
[00:39:18.234 --> 00:39:20.196]  I've got a big, big stack on that.
[00:39:21.397 --> 00:39:24.880]  But I really want to get into Tucker Carlson next hour and the economy.
[00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:35.449]  But you've seen the total conniption fit against Tucker Carlson for his January 6th documentary that he's going to spend all week on next week.
[00:39:35.969 --> 00:39:40.373]  The whole week is about false flags and the FBI because they have the proof, they have the names, they know how they did it.
[00:39:40.973 --> 00:39:41.694]  And it's all coming out.
[00:39:43.311 --> 00:39:45.132]  And so they're calling for him to be taken off the air.
[00:39:45.632 --> 00:39:46.292]  CNN is.
[00:39:46.372 --> 00:39:48.513]  Others, they're calling him the new Alex Jones.
[00:39:48.533 --> 00:39:50.013]  They're saying he's worse than Alex Jones.
[00:39:50.973 --> 00:39:53.334]  Well, I mean, he's not worse than Alex Jones.
[00:39:53.854 --> 00:39:57.315]  I know he's worse for them because he's just as well-spoken, maybe better.
[00:39:57.335 --> 00:39:59.216]  And he's definitely slicker.
[00:39:59.236 --> 00:40:01.877]  And I love his show.
[00:40:02.077 --> 00:40:03.777]  And yeah, he's awake.
[00:40:04.698 --> 00:40:05.138]  No Tucker.
[00:40:06.266 --> 00:40:12.431]  Doesn't shrink from the fact that he thought I was full of it 20 years ago and 10 years ago thought, wow, Alex is actually right about a lot of things.
[00:40:12.491 --> 00:40:19.938]  And in the last five years, you know, Tucker's told me that he understands that I'm a trailblazer and that I understand what's going on in the world.
[00:40:19.978 --> 00:40:22.760]  But so did the Kissinger group tried to hire me and told me the same thing.
[00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:25.122]  It's just that he's not working for Henry Kissinger either.
[00:40:26.103 --> 00:40:34.470]  So I'm not trying to sit there and brag, folks, but most people aren't nine years old reading British wartime psychological profiles on Hitler.
[00:40:34.975 --> 00:40:36.236]  That's what I've been drawn to.
[00:40:36.896 --> 00:40:38.056]  That's what I've been drawn to fight.
[00:40:38.196 --> 00:40:38.897]  It's what I do.
[00:40:39.057 --> 00:40:40.037]  And I've been proven right.
[00:40:40.097 --> 00:40:40.817]  Everybody knows it.
[00:40:41.338 --> 00:40:43.739]  And so, yes, New World Order, you got a problem.
[00:40:43.759 --> 00:40:45.079]  You think you got rid of Alex Jones?
[00:40:45.579 --> 00:40:47.300]  Try a thousand more Alex Joneses.
[00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:49.261]  Because that's how this works.
[00:40:49.421 --> 00:40:51.802]  And by the way, the new and improved Alex Jones.
[00:40:51.862 --> 00:40:52.782]  Yes, Tucker Carlson.
[00:40:53.282 --> 00:40:55.123]  But it's not because he got it all from me.
[00:40:56.083 --> 00:40:58.284]  It's because he finally saw it was all real.
[00:40:58.544 --> 00:40:59.905]  And everything I talked about happened.
[00:41:00.586 --> 00:41:02.247]  He doesn't need to hear from me now anymore.
[00:41:02.547 --> 00:41:04.847]  He can go watch the news and see it unfolding.
[00:41:06.328 --> 00:41:07.108]  And see it happening.
[00:41:07.128 --> 00:41:09.089]  And so no wonder Joy Reid comes out in a taxi.
[00:41:09.909 --> 00:41:11.050]  And calls him the new Alex Jones.
[00:41:11.090 --> 00:41:13.370]  And calls him a white supremacist and a holocaust denier.
[00:41:13.610 --> 00:41:15.031]  Notice she doesn't play any clips of that.
[00:41:15.911 --> 00:41:17.272]  She's the one covering up for Fauci.
[00:41:17.772 --> 00:41:20.973]  She's the one covering up for the real globalist supremacy.
[00:41:21.573 --> 00:41:25.935]  Taking healthy black children and killing them at a pharma facility.
[00:41:25.975 --> 00:41:27.135]  Just like they do dogs.
[00:41:27.995 --> 00:41:30.096]  You're not going to hear a damn thing out of her evil mouth.
[00:41:31.377 --> 00:41:32.777]  She's not evil because she's black.
[00:41:32.878 --> 00:41:34.618]  She's evil because she's sold out to evil.
[00:41:35.138 --> 00:41:36.619]  And Fauci's not evil because he's white.
[00:41:37.059 --> 00:41:38.759]  He's evil because he's sold out to evil.
[00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:41.380]  And it doesn't matter if it's Joy Reid or Fauci.
[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:42.200]  They're our enemies.
[00:41:42.721 --> 00:41:43.641]  And they hate us.
[00:41:44.041 --> 00:41:45.301]  And they're coming after all of us.
[00:41:45.341 --> 00:41:47.222]  I don't give a rat's ass what color you are.
[00:41:47.462 --> 00:41:50.923]  You better wake up out there and get with the program to fight the New World Order.
[00:41:51.363 --> 00:41:54.544]  And you better download Jesus Christ right now into your soul.
[00:41:55.084 --> 00:41:57.925]  You better get the Holy Spirit last week.
[00:41:58.625 --> 00:42:00.286]  Because it's on, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:01.818 --> 00:42:03.939]  World government, new world order in our face.
[00:42:03.999 --> 00:42:04.599]  I'm going to break.
[00:42:05.219 --> 00:42:07.520]  All I can say is I've got a lot of stuff going on.
[00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:10.361]  I got a lot of irons in the fire, and I need your financial support.
[00:42:10.601 --> 00:42:12.221]  Plus, I got great products you already need.
[00:42:12.601 --> 00:42:15.022]  Ultimate Bone Broth is incredible what it does for your body.
[00:42:15.202 --> 00:42:26.726]  Not just the highest quality concentrated bone broth from chicken, it's so good for your immune system and joints, but the Chaga mushroom, the bee pollen, and a huge dose in each serving of high quality concentrated turmeric.
[00:42:27.688 --> 00:42:28.328]  It's amazing.
[00:42:28.709 --> 00:42:29.169]  Sold out.

[00:42:30.990 --> 00:42:32.111]  Now back in.
[00:42:32.371 --> 00:42:33.692]  Took us a year to get it formulated.
[00:42:33.752 --> 00:42:35.453]  Once we even were able to get a manufacturer.
[00:42:35.833 --> 00:42:36.574]  Made in America.
[00:42:36.654 --> 00:42:37.134]  Over the top.
[00:42:37.174 --> 00:42:37.614]  Powerful.
[00:42:37.935 --> 00:42:40.536]  Leading brands are more expensive and aren't even as strong or good.
[00:42:40.997 --> 00:42:43.838]  Infowarsstore.com and BrainForce Plus.
[00:42:44.119 --> 00:42:45.239]  The amazing Nootropic.
[00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:46.720]  Sold out for almost eight months.
[00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:47.381]  Back in stock.
[00:42:47.401 --> 00:42:47.821]  50% off.

[00:43:02.468 --> 00:43:04.370]  All right, folks.
[00:43:04.990 --> 00:43:08.452]  You can analyze every little piece of this for a thousand years and get caught up in that.
[00:43:08.592 --> 00:43:09.653]  And we do that.
[00:43:09.673 --> 00:43:11.594]  It's important to understand the facets.
[00:43:13.737 --> 00:43:23.847]  The most important thing you do is just pull back and know the globalists are exempt for everything they're doing to us, and they are trying to collapse society, destroy industrial society to force depopulation.
[00:43:24.267 --> 00:43:31.234]  And during that crisis, again, they're going to pose as the saviors for the cascading problems they themselves have created.
[00:43:31.915 --> 00:43:37.320]  And so I want to play for you on the heels of everything we just covered.
[00:43:39.008 --> 00:43:40.149]  A Rutgers professor.
[00:43:40.189 --> 00:43:42.170]  I mean, we see this kind of stuff every few minutes now.
[00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:43.791]  There's so many examples of this.
[00:43:43.811 --> 00:43:45.272]  This is not some rogue person.
[00:43:45.652 --> 00:43:46.833]  This is the standard garbage.
[00:43:47.713 --> 00:43:51.175]  Teaching that white people are committed to being villains.
[00:43:52.476 --> 00:43:54.517]  We got to take these mother effers out.
[00:43:55.138 --> 00:43:59.700]  This is a professor spewing this hatred on YouTube on a show called The Root.
[00:44:01.401 --> 00:44:02.642]  The Root is evil white people.
[00:44:03.453 --> 00:44:06.634]  Not evil globalists, not eugenicists, not the transhumanists, no, no.
[00:44:06.814 --> 00:44:07.954]  They're the ones funding this lady.
[00:44:08.134 --> 00:44:18.437]  She's funded by the university, AT&T, CNN, all the Fortune 1000 basically, led by the Fortune 100, and owned by BlackRock and the private Federal Reserve.
[00:44:18.877 --> 00:44:20.178]  They are funding this lady.
[00:44:20.698 --> 00:44:25.119]  Remember just 10 years ago it was only white professors saying whites are inherently evil, we gotta get rid of them.
[00:44:25.359 --> 00:44:30.821]  They were trying to train to finally get enough black people on board so that white folks see this and hate black people.
[00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:33.262]  This is meant to create racism on both sides.
[00:44:33.802 --> 00:44:36.825]  This is just dirty, nasty, evil stuff right here.
[00:44:37.085 --> 00:44:37.546]  Here it is.
[00:44:38.266 --> 00:44:42.050]  I think that white people are committed to being villains in the aggregate, right?
[00:44:42.110 --> 00:44:48.716]  The real sort of issue here, and you know, I've heard people sort of say it, is what I think that white people viscerally fear.
[00:44:49.016 --> 00:44:52.079]  It's not that white people don't know, right, what they have done.
[00:44:52.459 --> 00:44:52.820]  They know.
[00:44:53.681 --> 00:45:06.748]  They fear that there is no other way to be human but the way in which they are human, which is to... So, you know, like, you talk to white people, and whenever you really want to have a reckoning about it, they say stuff like, you know, it's just human nature.
[00:45:06.848 --> 00:45:10.731]  If y'all had all of this power, you would have done the same thing, right?
[00:45:11.311 --> 00:45:13.652]  And it's like, no, that's what white humans did.
[00:45:14.012 --> 00:45:17.174]  White human beings... Okay, just because I can't listen to it, turn it off.
[00:45:17.735 --> 00:45:19.075]  Later, I'll try to play the rest of it.
[00:45:19.295 --> 00:45:43.932]   But ladies and gentlemen, They are inflicting and poisoning the minds of black people that pay to go to public school, private school, because your parents pay one way or the other through the taxes, or to college, to hear that, oh my gosh, spaceships and airplanes and medicine and telecommunications, that came from white people predominantly, and so we can't have any part of that.
[00:45:47.577 --> 00:46:00.429]  So, this is black people thinking, I'm a victim, I can't ever own a nice house, I can't have a nice car, I can't have good medicine for my children, I can't go on trips, I mean, I can't own a restaurant, I can't be a scientist, I can't be an... I mean, you're just saying this.
[00:46:01.070 --> 00:46:07.576]  Meanwhile, it's the education system that in predominantly black areas on purpose is designed to create zero literacy.
[00:46:07.996 --> 00:46:09.157]  I showed an article out of...
[00:46:10.327 --> 00:46:19.092]  Major cities in Maryland where they have zero pupils graduating from 5th grade into 6th grade and so on with any math proficiency.
[00:46:19.132 --> 00:46:21.714]  Zero, zero proficiency scores.
[00:46:23.094 --> 00:46:24.435]  Zero passed.
[00:46:25.496 --> 00:46:39.364]  And that's the academic system, the same one that is putting her up there saying that white people inherently are bad with some dude smiling and just like he's in Valhalla hearing this.
[00:46:40.515 --> 00:46:43.597]  Because the entire corporate system says this is right and this is true.
[00:46:43.957 --> 00:46:45.638]  And so these idiots get to be racist.
[00:46:45.658 --> 00:46:50.520]  They get to go out and proselytize and get paid by big corporations and taxpayer money to act like this.
[00:46:51.961 --> 00:46:57.023]  When if she went to Africa forever, she'd come back and kiss the ground in this country.
[00:46:57.043 --> 00:46:59.365]  And that's what happens to a lot of black folks that go to Africa and come back.
[00:46:59.765 --> 00:47:04.807]  That's why there's a lot of Africans come here and they do not like liberal, fake leftist black Americans.
[00:47:04.827 --> 00:47:06.128]  They say, you people are crazy.
[00:47:07.102 --> 00:47:10.523]  You have no idea how blessed you are to live in the West.
[00:47:10.623 --> 00:47:17.944]  And again, people in the West were living in caves and, you know, huts and everything before Christianity.
[00:47:18.925 --> 00:47:21.505]  And the African countries that are Christian are doing well.
[00:47:21.565 --> 00:47:22.525]  The ones that aren't, aren't.
[00:47:23.065 --> 00:47:25.466]  It's Christianity that will lift us all up.
[00:47:25.786 --> 00:47:30.007]  But you believe in it as real or an operating system, like got milk?
[00:47:30.788 --> 00:47:31.368]  Got freedom?
[00:47:31.428 --> 00:47:32.429]  Got Christianity?
[00:47:32.529 --> 00:47:33.169]  You need it.
[00:47:33.649 --> 00:47:38.931]  But instead you get this big fat witch of racism up there saying I'm inherently black because I'm white.
[00:47:39.412 --> 00:47:40.852]  You're nothing but a black Nazi.
[00:47:40.912 --> 00:47:42.893]  Burn in hell you big old fat ugly witch.
[00:47:43.353 --> 00:47:44.874]  You better watch your ass around me.
[00:47:45.574 --> 00:47:46.715]  I got no friends.
[00:47:50.076 --> 00:47:52.977]  They can't be seen with me.
[00:47:56.238 --> 00:47:57.479]  Here we are ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47:59.910 --> 00:48:03.651]  I gotta tell you, the newspapers and the controlled corporate press don't have the power anymore.
[00:48:03.671 --> 00:48:16.436]  And so that's why they're trying to flood us with third-world populations that come from squalor and tyranny so they won't know any better, and that's why they're trying to dumb people down, whether they be black or white or Hispanic or Asian, in the public schools.
[00:48:17.256 --> 00:48:29.040]  With numbers from across the country coming in, not just Maryland, of record numbers of schools where entire schools have zero passing grades in math or in English.
[00:48:32.116 --> 00:48:36.740]  They want a Tower of Babel of Tower of Babel they control.
[00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:44.465]  So when they carry out their planetary endgame of depopulation, no one knows what hit them.
[00:48:45.626 --> 00:48:49.789]  If you are a TV viewer, you probably noticed this big mural, this piece of art we have up here.
[00:48:51.471 --> 00:48:57.115]  And that is a piece of art that is actually a mural at the Denver International Airport.
[00:48:57.811 --> 00:48:59.212]  And people ask what it means.
[00:48:59.453 --> 00:49:06.539]  Well, the artist said it is a rendition of the Spanish Civil War, and it is anti-fascist.
[00:49:08.380 --> 00:49:11.603]  But if you look at what the left's actually doing today, it is fascist.
[00:49:11.663 --> 00:49:22.573]  And notice the rainbow is actually used as a weapon and turned into a spike of black death that then rains down fire on men, women, and children of every race, color, and creed.
[00:49:24.716 --> 00:49:27.918]  And isn't that what Fauci and the New World Order and the globalists are doing?
[00:49:29.039 --> 00:49:30.880]  Isn't Klaus Schwab a neo-fascist?
[00:49:35.843 --> 00:49:38.885]  Very, very interesting, isn't it?
[00:49:39.025 --> 00:49:39.306]  Okay.
[00:49:39.326 --> 00:49:41.987]  Let me tell you what's coming up this hour.
[00:49:42.007 --> 00:49:43.168]  We got a big hour lined up for you.
[00:49:44.329 --> 00:49:46.590]  Leo Zegami, the Vatican insider.
[00:49:46.890 --> 00:49:48.932]  I mean, I used to hear Zegami 15 years ago.
[00:49:49.671 --> 00:49:51.032]  And I thought, this guy's full of crap.
[00:49:51.072 --> 00:49:52.393]  There won't be a Jesuit Pope.
[00:49:53.013 --> 00:50:00.837]  He won't then, they won't be, they won't have another Pope step down and then they'll have a new Pope at the same time, moving them towards a council and not a Pope.
[00:50:01.257 --> 00:50:04.659]  And then sure enough, everything he said happened like six, seven years later, exactly as he said.
[00:50:04.679 --> 00:50:05.960]  So I really respect him.
[00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:13.324]  And he also took me into some castles and other crazy stuff when we were out there in Italy once.
[00:50:13.384 --> 00:50:16.106]  He's definitely an insider who exposed the system.
[00:50:16.446 --> 00:50:27.974]   He's joining us bottom of the hour to talk about That meeting that just took place yesterday at the Eternal City outside Rome, Italy.
[00:50:28.375 --> 00:50:32.017]  So he's got some big geopolitical news for us at the bottom of the hour.
[00:50:32.057 --> 00:50:34.158]  Right now, let's plow into this news.
[00:50:34.839 --> 00:50:35.479]  Well, here it is.
[00:50:35.519 --> 00:50:36.820]  It's on InfoWars.com.
[00:50:37.220 --> 00:50:38.661]  But we don't just ask you to believe us.
[00:50:38.681 --> 00:50:40.162]  We have a copy of the bill here for you.
[00:50:40.582 --> 00:50:41.563]  That's kind of how we do it.
[00:50:43.064 --> 00:50:48.167]  Notice when Joy Reid called Tucker Carlson a white supremacist Holocaust denier last night.
[00:50:49.873 --> 00:50:51.174]  She did not show a clip of it.
[00:50:52.755 --> 00:50:57.779]  While she covers up Rafalchi doing medical experiments and killing black children that we covered earlier.
[00:50:58.900 --> 00:51:01.922]  And we even showed you the proof and the articles and the names and everything.
[00:51:02.103 --> 00:51:03.624]  And we've got some more breaking news on that.
[00:51:04.044 --> 00:51:08.908]  The Clintons just apologized for secret radiation testing on foster children that killed thousands.
[00:51:10.309 --> 00:51:11.890]  Oh, that's back in the news, though.
[00:51:11.950 --> 00:51:15.453]  Clinton apologizes for radiation test experiments on children.
[00:51:15.753 --> 00:51:16.814]  But we'll get to that coming up.
[00:51:19.132 --> 00:51:21.754]  These are the bad guys, but the mad scientists that run things.
[00:51:21.774 --> 00:51:22.815]  That's the top of the pyramid.
[00:51:23.235 --> 00:51:24.176]  So let's get back to this.
[00:51:24.516 --> 00:51:34.103]  House Build Back Better bill, one they currently say they almost have the votes to pass, has $600 IRS reporting provision.
[00:51:34.123 --> 00:51:34.704]  It had been $700.
[00:51:35.524 --> 00:51:36.645]  They promised to take it out.
[00:51:36.685 --> 00:51:37.786]  That's why you knew they'd keep it in.
[00:51:37.806 --> 00:51:39.067]  It has two provisions.
[00:51:39.087 --> 00:51:48.267]   One, if you have over $10,000 of transactions period a year in your account, which the average person on minimum wage makes $16,000, People on welfare make $20,000.
[00:51:48.327 --> 00:51:49.908]  See how they incentivize that.
[00:51:50.148 --> 00:51:52.090]  But everybody will be watched in live time.
[00:51:52.130 --> 00:51:54.591]  No more Fourth Amendment to be tied to your social credit score.
[00:51:54.852 --> 00:51:56.473]  And now it's back in the bill again.
[00:51:56.493 --> 00:51:59.955]  House Build Back Better Bill, which is again a whole other story.
[00:52:01.496 --> 00:52:02.217]  That's the U.N.
[00:52:02.277 --> 00:52:04.178]  Klaus Schwab Great Reset term.
[00:52:04.419 --> 00:52:06.320]  Destroy everything and then take over society.
[00:52:07.241 --> 00:52:15.507]  House Build Back Better Bill includes $600 IRS reporting provision.
[00:52:15.587 --> 00:52:16.788]  Here's the bill itself.
[00:52:18.965 --> 00:52:25.190]  Page 1673, section 3406 in the Build Back Better text.
[00:52:25.730 --> 00:52:40.622]  And there it is, right there for you on screen, where anybody with $600 transactions will be tracked in live time by a giant computer system that's already in place, already watching what you do.
[00:52:41.022 --> 00:52:48.668]  They just want to get you ready for having money taken directly out of your account or your house being taken or anything else, just like they're doing in Australia.
[00:52:49.395 --> 00:52:52.737]  That I covered earlier for you.
[00:52:53.337 --> 00:52:57.599]  But I'll tell you who won't be having money taken out of their bank accounts for not being good little slaves.
[00:52:58.379 --> 00:52:58.760]  Here it is.
[00:52:58.860 --> 00:52:59.080]  U.S.
[00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:02.581]  in talks to pay hundreds of millions of families separated at the border.
[00:53:02.601 --> 00:53:03.202]  Wall Street Journal.
[00:53:03.582 --> 00:53:15.207]  Biden is saying he wants to pay $450,000 plus to each person who just claims they were separated from their parents even though they had no ID.
[00:53:16.628 --> 00:53:18.189]  They don't care if it's an hour or a day.
[00:53:19.654 --> 00:53:46.051]  450,000.
[00:53:20.315 --> 00:53:59.046]   So if you didn't think there wasn't a giant flood, if you didn't think the Mexican border police overwhelmed by 100,000 from the Caribbean that came up through Mexico slamming across a few days ago with hundreds of thousands more coming, if you thought the Texas border totally swamped and totally collapsed wasn't insane enough, if you thought all the tuberculosis and the rest of it pouring across the border wasn't bad enough, let me roll some of that footage, of the border totally collapsed, if you didn't think that was bad enough, Now, anybody that goes to the NGOs set up by Soros that now run the Border Patrol and run ICE, they will determine, their lawyers will determine who gets $450,000 plus a piece.
[00:53:59.986 --> 00:54:10.852]  They will then launder the majority of that money back into the NGOs and into the, quote, liberal lawyers to then fund the next phase of the invasion and the takeover.
[00:54:11.781 --> 00:54:17.645]  So, this is the purposeful replacement migration, breaking of the southern border just as Europe was broken 110%.
[00:54:18.166 --> 00:54:29.194]  Organized by the UN, announced, prepared, and this is the middle class of Mexico and Central America and the Caribbean coming in.
[00:54:30.595 --> 00:54:33.477]  This is the middle class, also with some criminal smugglers and others.
[00:54:33.497 --> 00:54:36.340]  But it is now the giant exodus.
[00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:37.581]  And by the way, I don't blame these people.
[00:54:38.061 --> 00:54:39.362]  They've been under a year and a half.
[00:54:39.402 --> 00:54:40.683]  In fact, they've done polls.
[00:54:41.104 --> 00:54:42.305]  International news groups have done polls.
[00:54:42.725 --> 00:54:43.626]  They say, why are you coming?
[00:54:43.646 --> 00:54:45.287]  They said, I owned a business or I had a farm.
[00:54:45.667 --> 00:54:46.448]  They don't let us farm.
[00:54:46.488 --> 00:54:47.789]  They don't let us sell businesses.
[00:54:48.309 --> 00:54:49.671]  We had to eat our livestock.
[00:54:49.731 --> 00:54:50.491]  We are starving.
[00:54:50.591 --> 00:54:51.472]  We have no other choice.
[00:54:51.492 --> 00:54:57.217]  So we go to the refugee center and they give us the debit card and they give us the pass and they tell us go to the north.
[00:54:59.841 --> 00:55:00.961]  And this is what's going on.
[00:55:02.522 --> 00:55:05.263]  And then, I mean, what did I say hundreds of times last year?
[00:55:05.583 --> 00:55:06.723]  Like, I was a parrot.
[00:55:07.023 --> 00:55:07.823]  We got emails.
[00:55:07.883 --> 00:55:08.664]  We got calls.
[00:55:08.904 --> 00:55:09.824]  My family complained.
[00:55:09.844 --> 00:55:14.665]  They said, will you stop saying when the first world collapses, the third world dies?
[00:55:14.986 --> 00:55:20.707]  Will you stop saying that there'll be hundreds of millions pouring up here within a year and a half to two years and the UN will organize it?
[00:55:21.067 --> 00:55:22.328]  And then that'll make us collapse.
[00:55:22.688 --> 00:55:23.448]  We know, Alex.
[00:55:23.508 --> 00:55:23.768]  Okay.
[00:55:24.068 --> 00:55:25.209]  But no one else was saying it.
[00:55:25.309 --> 00:55:26.669]  And now here we are.
[00:55:28.018 --> 00:55:29.659]  People hiding in trash cans.
[00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:31.361]  People eating out of trash cans.
[00:55:31.381 --> 00:55:32.341]  People hiding in trucks.
[00:55:32.661 --> 00:55:37.505]  People looting and robbing and carjacking and raping and it's just total collapse.
[00:55:38.766 --> 00:55:43.830]  Desperate, desperate, desperate, desperate people while they pay the average American to not work.
[00:55:44.853 --> 00:56:03.923]  And while millions quit their jobs over the poison shots who were fired, and then the left and Soros have the nerve to say, oh, it's strike-tober, people are calling for the Great Reset, they're calling for Build Back Better, they're calling for universal basic income, that's why everyone's quitting their jobs, the firefighters, the firemen, the fire, the policemen, I say that because they don't want me to say that.
[00:56:05.264 --> 00:56:16.323]   All of that, the airline stewardesses, everybody quitting, Or being fired, and they go, oh, it's a communist rebellion, good!
[00:56:16.663 --> 00:56:20.785]  Workers are quitting to stand up to the man and demand the bill back better universal income.
[00:56:21.205 --> 00:56:25.888]  Which once they bankrupt everybody, then they give you universal income, tied to the debit card that controls every facet of your life.
[00:56:26.068 --> 00:56:27.469]  There's also the vaccine passport.
[00:56:27.949 --> 00:56:30.770]  You have to take poison to be able to have a job, or get your money, or live your life.
[00:56:31.031 --> 00:56:35.653]  And then on top of it, the carbon tax that tracks everywhere you go and what you do and decides if you're allowed to even travel.
[00:56:35.853 --> 00:56:37.414]  This isn't coming, it's here.
[00:56:38.211 --> 00:56:39.131]  Where are the governors?
[00:56:39.492 --> 00:56:40.432]  Where is Rand Paul?
[00:56:40.672 --> 00:56:41.893]  Where are the good Republican senators?
[00:56:42.093 --> 00:56:43.833]  There's only Alex Jones and Tucker Carlson.
[00:56:44.654 --> 00:56:45.014]  That's it.
[00:56:45.874 --> 00:56:46.235]  That's it.
[00:56:46.395 --> 00:56:47.695]  That actually tell you what's going on.
[00:56:47.935 --> 00:56:48.275]  That's it.
[00:56:49.176 --> 00:56:50.096]  Alex Jones, Tucker Carlson.
[00:56:50.636 --> 00:56:52.797]  I didn't see that on my bingo card 20 years ago, did you?
[00:56:53.478 --> 00:56:57.680]  When Tucker called me a horrible, evil person that tells horrible, evil, scary lies.
[00:56:57.760 --> 00:56:59.600]  Now he knows it's all real and says, I apologize.
[00:56:59.620 --> 00:56:59.961]  You're right.
[00:57:00.221 --> 00:57:00.801]  Now let's fight it.
[00:57:01.391 --> 00:57:02.372]  Because he has a soul.
[00:57:02.792 --> 00:57:04.654]  Do you have one?
[00:57:05.114 --> 00:57:08.778]  Because believe me, this is only going to get worse from here until we arrest the globalists.
[00:57:09.058 --> 00:57:09.518]  Stay with us.
[00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:12.241]  Here we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:12.421 --> 00:57:14.463]  All right, get ready for this.
[00:57:14.523 --> 00:57:15.484]  This is big news.
[00:57:16.725 --> 00:57:23.231]  And if I built this up, and if I said I was going to do a special emergency broadcast tomorrow, there'd be millions of extra people tuned in.
[00:57:23.271 --> 00:57:24.011]  It'd be a big deal.
[00:57:24.432 --> 00:57:25.112]  Others would care.
[00:57:25.232 --> 00:57:26.113]  Others would pay attention.
[00:57:26.153 --> 00:57:26.834]  It would get out there.
[00:57:27.597 --> 00:57:32.681]  But if it's hidden right in the middle of the show, even though a couple million people conservatively are tuned in, it'll go nowhere.
[00:57:33.402 --> 00:57:36.865]  A great example of the story I'm about to cover is Joe Rogan two weeks ago.
[00:57:37.745 --> 00:57:40.147]  He had Michael Malice on, I guess about a week and a half ago.
[00:57:41.168 --> 00:57:48.835]  And Michael Malice was talking about how powerful people are secretly taking ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine and budesedine.
[00:57:48.875 --> 00:57:56.481]  And Joe goes, yeah, my doctor, who's doctored a bunch of rich and powerful people, he's treated over 200 members of Congress, most of them Democrats.
[00:57:57.771 --> 00:57:59.853]  And even said the name of his doctor and the rest of it.
[00:58:00.934 --> 00:58:02.955]  That didn't go anywhere for over a week.
[00:58:03.676 --> 00:58:04.657]  And then it got picked up.
[00:58:06.578 --> 00:58:09.160]  Because we basically found out about it.
[00:58:10.161 --> 00:58:13.424]  But that's an example of Joe had at least 10 million viewers on that show.
[00:58:13.464 --> 00:58:14.024]  I went and saw it.
[00:58:14.344 --> 00:58:16.146]  Hell, I had dinner with him the night after they did the show.
[00:58:16.666 --> 00:58:17.447]  And they talked about the show.
[00:58:17.467 --> 00:58:18.488]  I'd seen excerpts of it.
[00:58:18.648 --> 00:58:19.388]  I've seen them since.
[00:58:19.408 --> 00:58:22.511]  But I didn't know buried in there was a five-minute story about that.
[00:58:23.914 --> 00:58:27.936]  Because it was buried in the full show and was not put out as its own headline.
[00:58:29.117 --> 00:58:35.019]  That's why, man, you could take Joe's show every day and put the stuff on there, and you could have dozens of articles written on that.
[00:58:35.099 --> 00:58:38.161]  But the system doesn't like what's on there, so they ignore it.
[00:58:38.201 --> 00:58:39.842]  And Joe and I were talking about that just the other night.
[00:58:41.562 --> 00:58:47.485]  So that's why it's so important for you, when Joe has a good guest on or covers something huge, to magnify it.
[00:58:48.106 --> 00:58:53.008]  Because I tracked it back on how it went viral to a day before yesterday.
[00:58:53.806 --> 00:58:58.790]  When somebody with just a small Twitter account took the clip, saw it, and put it out, and then it went chain reaction.
[00:58:59.050 --> 00:59:25.049]   So you think you get a clip of my show or Joe's show, and oh, you know, maybe a thousand people see it on your Twitter or Instagram, but then somebody else copies it and they get a half million, and then they get two million, and then ten million people learn, oh, members of Congress are taking ivermectin even though they tell me not to take it, and so they know Congress is lying to them, they know the Democrats are suppressing knowledge from them, And they know about something medically that can really help them and their families so they don't die.
[00:59:25.729 --> 00:59:27.711]  This is life-giving stuff and it's so simple.
[00:59:28.091 --> 00:59:32.074]  But you hear me talk a lot about my biggest frustration is the show is huge.
[00:59:32.695 --> 00:59:34.696]  But if I do a special report, it breaks through.
[00:59:35.317 --> 00:59:37.698]  If I just do it on the show, it's like, oh, that's just the show.
[00:59:38.039 --> 00:59:39.160]  No, this is not just a show.
[00:59:39.300 --> 00:59:42.322]  Each section is a bunch of key stuff we're covering.
[00:59:43.403 --> 00:59:46.165]  It's guests we're having and it's particular things we're focusing on.
[00:59:48.292 --> 00:59:50.633]  So, I am going to do an emergency transmission tomorrow.
[00:59:50.653 --> 00:59:58.154]  I've got a film crew here already interviewing me in the morning, and then I'm going to tape to air, like it's live, at 2 p.m., and it should be able to air by about 5 p.m.
[00:59:58.194 --> 00:59:58.514]  tomorrow.
[00:59:59.775 --> 01:00:14.058]  And I'm going to go through all these documents then and really flesh it out and describe how nightmarish this takeover revolution is going to be, so people understand not just the current stuff they're hitting us with, but how bad it's about to get if there isn't a giant awakening to this right now.
[01:00:14.442 --> 01:00:20.442]   And I'm asking you to be like that person on Twitter three days ago that watched Joe Rogan's podcast
[01:00:20.442 --> 01:00:25.942]   and out of the millions and millions that watched it, no one thought to take that clip out. I went and checked.
[01:00:25.942 --> 01:00:32.942]   So for a week and a half, nobody went and got the clip, nobody put it out, and then finally that person did it.
[01:00:33.049 --> 01:00:40.692]  In fact, I meant to print off their name and, you know, show as an example, but then Twitter would just ban that person because, again, they don't want that chain reaction happening.
[01:00:41.032 --> 01:00:43.574]  It's, yeah, it's important that Joe reaches his regular audience.
[01:00:43.634 --> 01:00:45.335]  It's important I reach my regular audience.
[01:00:45.375 --> 01:00:50.217]  But this is a launch point to the other people that don't know.
[01:00:50.317 --> 01:00:51.657]  They're the ones we're trying to get to.
[01:00:52.098 --> 01:00:53.939]  That goes back to the prodigal son story in the Bible.
[01:00:54.979 --> 01:00:57.560]  Whether you believe the story happened or not, it's a great story that teaches a lot.
[01:00:58.120 --> 01:00:59.001]  And you know the story, right?
[01:00:59.835 --> 01:01:02.017]  The younger son asked for his inheritance.
[01:01:02.577 --> 01:01:04.478]  That's basically 20% of the father's wealth.
[01:01:05.939 --> 01:01:07.400]  It's under that form of Jewish law.
[01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:08.641]  The first form, we get 80%.
[01:01:09.642 --> 01:01:11.423]  And he says, I want my money.
[01:01:11.803 --> 01:01:13.104]  His dad's rich, gives him the money.
[01:01:13.444 --> 01:01:15.406]  He runs off for a decade, spends it all.
[01:01:15.446 --> 01:01:16.146]  Everybody's fake.
[01:01:16.487 --> 01:01:17.067]  He gets robbed.
[01:01:17.087 --> 01:01:17.587]  He gets hurt.
[01:01:18.768 --> 01:01:23.632]  He comes back, crawling back to his dad, learning all the people were fake and were garbage.
[01:01:23.672 --> 01:01:24.732]  And he says, Dad, I'm sorry.
[01:01:24.752 --> 01:01:25.353]  I apologize.
[01:01:25.373 --> 01:01:26.393]  And he gave him a new suit.
[01:01:26.714 --> 01:01:28.515]  They said, kill the best heifer we've got.
[01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:30.761]  You know, the best veal we've got.
[01:01:31.721 --> 01:01:33.002]  Let's have a big party in the village.
[01:01:33.382 --> 01:01:34.283]  My son has returned.
[01:01:34.303 --> 01:01:38.665]  And the faithful son looked at him and said, My God, you never had a party for me.
[01:01:38.685 --> 01:01:40.647]  You never gave me your finest cloak.
[01:01:41.047 --> 01:01:42.267]  You never threw a party for me.
[01:01:42.287 --> 01:01:43.108]  You never did this.
[01:01:44.068 --> 01:01:45.649]  You never killed the best heifer for me.
[01:01:45.669 --> 01:01:51.293]  And he looks at his son, his number one son, he says, You never ran off.
[01:01:51.353 --> 01:01:54.354]  You never did what your younger brother, who's an idiot, did.
[01:01:54.755 --> 01:01:55.675]  I love him so much.
[01:01:55.695 --> 01:01:57.036]  Can you imagine how much I love you?
[01:01:57.056 --> 01:01:58.477]  I love you way more.
[01:02:02.565 --> 01:02:04.647]  You don't want to see what I do if you ran off and did this.
[01:02:04.687 --> 01:02:05.448]  I couldn't handle it.
[01:02:05.468 --> 01:02:06.309]  I couldn't deal with it.
[01:02:06.949 --> 01:02:09.192]  But your idiot brother's back and he's apologizing.
[01:02:09.212 --> 01:02:09.672]  We love him.
[01:02:09.912 --> 01:02:11.594]  So let's try to get him on the straight and narrow here.
[01:02:12.475 --> 01:02:12.955]  And that's it.
[01:02:13.015 --> 01:02:16.118]  We're trying to get the prodigal sons and daughters.
[01:02:16.299 --> 01:02:20.383]  That's who we want is the idiots, the morons that are in a coma.
[01:02:21.798 --> 01:02:24.299]  Because they're going to be used as a weapon against us in the collapse.
[01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:29.102]  And God's watching, and God doesn't want us to just join the globals and say, yeah, they're a bunch of idiots.
[01:02:29.122 --> 01:02:30.243]  They've sure dumbed down the public.
[01:02:30.503 --> 01:02:31.683]  Yeah, they're a bunch of morons.
[01:02:32.904 --> 01:02:38.707]  They're going to put us in a position with billions of third world people clawing at us, coming in our homes, breaking in, attacking us.
[01:02:39.368 --> 01:02:41.249]  And you're going to be forced to defend yourself.
[01:02:41.529 --> 01:02:45.151]  So they're going to put you in a position to make you do that.
[01:02:45.191 --> 01:02:46.291]  So what am I to cover tomorrow?
[01:02:46.311 --> 01:02:47.572]  This is a large stack, as you can see.
[01:02:47.592 --> 01:02:51.054]  A lot of this is already public knowledge, but the key to it all is not.
[01:02:52.628 --> 01:03:03.173]  The Davos Group has announced, and there's links to it in this article, that they're going to put nanotech in your food to vaccinate you and help you, whether you like it or not.
[01:03:03.193 --> 01:03:07.916]  10 secrets that you didn't know about nano entities.
[01:03:08.656 --> 01:03:16.080]  And remember that big globalist Davos Group, High Priest Ferrari, that I talked about yesterday?
[01:03:17.768 --> 01:03:19.969]  Where he said, we're going to take over your body whether you like it or not.
[01:03:19.989 --> 01:03:20.789]  This is the new revolution.
[01:03:20.809 --> 01:03:23.830]  You're going to have nano-entities in you that will take over your brain.
[01:03:23.950 --> 01:03:24.611]  Well, here it is.
[01:03:25.371 --> 01:03:28.452]  Integration of nano-materials into the entire food supply.
[01:03:30.553 --> 01:03:34.035]  Installation of AI nano-particles for agro-food inspection.
[01:03:34.675 --> 01:03:39.997]  Hybrid probes installed into foods that insert platforms into your body.
[01:03:40.497 --> 01:03:42.558]  Injection of nano-bodies into your food.
[01:03:43.298 --> 01:03:44.879]  And they're saying, you must have this.
[01:03:45.973 --> 01:03:49.915]  The World Economic Forum informed us that our food supply was going to be disrupted.
[01:03:49.935 --> 01:03:49.975]  Oh!
[01:03:51.236 --> 01:03:58.460]  Beginning last year, agro-food safety inspection is going high-tech with newly constructed hybrid micro-nano entities.
[01:03:59.120 --> 01:03:59.981]  See, now they have rice.
[01:04:00.401 --> 01:04:02.322]  Yes, you read that correctly.
[01:04:04.309 --> 01:04:13.195]  Hybrid nano, nano entities, and these nano entities, these life forms, are not only going to be in the food supply, but also pharmacological products.
[01:04:13.495 --> 01:04:16.197]  Oh, like they already injected into us and lied about.
[01:04:17.546 --> 01:04:21.248]  There is much speculation about what these entities are over the next few weeks.
[01:04:21.268 --> 01:04:25.650]  We will become somewhat familiar with them as they pop up across the commercial market.
[01:04:25.850 --> 01:04:26.650]  Oh my goodness!
[01:04:27.150 --> 01:04:36.955]  Kind of like GMO salmon that's part insect just showed up six months ago on the East Coast and they said, we're not going to tell you if it's GMO, but we're letting you know it's out there now.
[01:04:37.615 --> 01:04:40.977]  They served at restaurants and you can buy it here and there.
[01:04:43.471 --> 01:04:44.071]  We're just doing it.
[01:04:44.131 --> 01:04:44.591]  We're doing it.
[01:04:45.452 --> 01:04:46.612]  It's like an attack.
[01:04:46.652 --> 01:04:47.772]  Paratroopers out of the sky.
[01:04:47.852 --> 01:04:48.492]  Red Dawn.
[01:04:49.332 --> 01:04:50.533]  Use whatever allegory you want.
[01:04:50.573 --> 01:04:53.653]  The attack on Eric King and Dune.
[01:04:53.673 --> 01:04:54.233]  Whatever you want.
[01:04:54.273 --> 01:04:55.133]  Whatever analogy you want.
[01:04:55.173 --> 01:04:56.154]  It's boom, boom, boom.
[01:04:56.174 --> 01:04:59.714]  They're blowing us up right now.
[01:04:59.834 --> 01:05:01.714]  We are in crazy town right now.
[01:05:02.655 --> 01:05:04.675]  I mean, we are in freaking crazy town.
[01:05:05.395 --> 01:05:10.136]  All the pedophilia, all the racism, all the attacks on capitalism in America and Christianity.
[01:05:10.959 --> 01:05:16.321]  Is a globalist behavioral psychologist revolution known as the Great Reset.
[01:05:17.361 --> 01:05:21.662]  And that's why you see all the major institutions, all the big banks, all the corporations.
[01:05:21.682 --> 01:05:23.543]  That's why you see the Vatican.
[01:05:24.283 --> 01:05:33.505]  All of this showing that the power of this earth, the God of this world, the fallen one is making his move and is in control for a short time.
[01:05:33.605 --> 01:05:35.006]  That God allows him to be to test us.
[01:05:35.876 --> 01:05:38.417]  And here it is from the Davos Group's own website.
[01:05:38.437 --> 01:05:39.097]  I want to show this.
[01:05:39.537 --> 01:05:41.417]  The list here is the actual patents.
[01:05:42.057 --> 01:05:42.738]  It's being announced.
[01:05:42.978 --> 01:05:47.419]  Food as production and delivery vehicles for human vaccines.
[01:05:49.199 --> 01:05:52.100]  Grow and eat your own vaccines, University of California.
[01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:58.541]  Functional hybrid micro nanoparticles promote agro food safety inspection.
[01:05:59.721 --> 01:06:02.402]  And the Davos Group announcements right here.
[01:06:05.612 --> 01:06:12.519]  Where they say, we're already putting nanoparticles in all your food to track and trace what you eat and what's happening with the food.
[01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:18.806]  And this is what we're doing to save the earth because of coming food shortages because of COVID-19.
[01:06:18.826 --> 01:06:27.015]  But it was the COVID-19 lockdowns, not COVID-19 that caused 25 million extra people to starve to death and 200 million people on the verge of death.
[01:06:29.011 --> 01:06:48.035]  And so they're saying, we're doing this now, and we're now having food inspection systems around the world test your food with nanoparticles that are mechanical and biological, just like Pepsi came out a decade ago, test their flavoring with a test using fetal cells.
[01:06:48.835 --> 01:06:53.036]  This is all based on industrial level, immortal cell lines.
[01:06:53.803 --> 01:06:54.604]  You don't know what those are?
[01:06:54.724 --> 01:06:55.504]  I suggest you look it up.
[01:06:55.524 --> 01:06:56.885]  There's two main cell lines they use.
[01:06:57.285 --> 01:07:00.027]  One was an aborted baby at eight months, a Caucasian.
[01:07:00.467 --> 01:07:04.030]  One was a black lady who died in 1951.
[01:07:04.990 --> 01:07:11.344]   And for some reason their cells never die, and so they can use the cells to I mean, they say they've grown the equivalent of 20-something million of her.
[01:07:11.565 --> 01:07:16.208]  They don't grow the whole body, they grow her cells, but in her weight of the black lady that died in 1951.
[01:07:16.709 --> 01:07:17.129]  Don't believe me?
[01:07:17.149 --> 01:07:18.230]  Just type in immortal cell line.
[01:07:18.750 --> 01:07:23.394]  So that's what they're doing with these immortal cell lines, and this is beyond any science fiction movie.
[01:07:23.434 --> 01:07:24.154]  It's a total nightmare.
[01:07:24.174 --> 01:07:26.136]  So I wanted to throw that out at you as well.
[01:07:26.196 --> 01:07:28.738]  Leo Zagami is a best-selling author, researcher.
[01:07:28.778 --> 01:07:30.980]  He's probably the best Vatican expert in the world.
[01:07:31.781 --> 01:07:35.484]  He is exiled, you know, as a political prisoner here in America.
[01:07:35.524 --> 01:07:36.285]  We're happy to have him.
[01:07:36.966 --> 01:07:40.228]  And of course, he brought us around the Vatican and surrounding areas many years ago.
[01:07:40.308 --> 01:07:43.351]  And I went there to do a report on what's happening, but he's now here.
[01:07:43.871 --> 01:07:51.598]  And he joins us to talk about the big events with Biden and what really happened at the Vatican yesterday and more and these huge world events.
[01:07:51.618 --> 01:07:53.500]  So thanks for coming on on short notice.
[01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:56.402]  Saw you on with Harrison Smith this morning on American Journal.
[01:07:56.422 --> 01:07:57.403]  I thought you did a great job.
[01:07:57.423 --> 01:07:58.204]  So thanks for joining us.
[01:07:59.420 --> 01:08:20.874]   Thank you for having me on and definitely today is a very important day because Joe Biden met with Pope Francis and they of course discussed what's going to be also discussed in the future COP26 meeting that will be held soon also in Scotland.
[01:08:20.874 --> 01:08:29.833]   So we have a lot happening and Pope Francis, of course, gave as a gift also his Encyclical
[01:08:29.833 --> 01:08:38.833]   Fratelli Tutti, All Brothers, which is a clearly Masonic encyclical that the Pope has done
[01:08:38.833 --> 01:08:45.514]   to formulate and bring even further the project for his one world religion, which is coming
[01:08:45.514 --> 01:08:47.914]  together.
[01:08:46.821 --> 01:09:06.317]   So the Pope has been very busy, more as a geopolitical political leader, Then as a religious leader, as you know, and of course, Biden said that he's a very important leader in this moment, especially when it comes to the subject of climate change.
[01:09:06.417 --> 01:09:11.221]  Because as you remember, a few years ago, I think it was 2015.
[01:09:11.702 --> 01:09:23.032]   And we discussed it when the Pope arrived also in America, but then he launched His encyclical, which is dedicated to basically climate change.
[01:09:23.172 --> 01:09:28.578]  So the Pope is all over the place when it comes down to the New World Order.
[01:09:28.598 --> 01:09:31.401]  He's definitely one of the key figures.
[01:09:31.961 --> 01:09:39.910]  And he has just appointed Jeffrey Sachs, which is a very controversial figure, as you know, a very controversial economist.
[01:09:40.850 --> 01:09:46.152]  Who let millions of people starve in countries like Russia in the past.
[01:09:46.232 --> 01:09:52.794]  Jeffrey Sachs has just been appointed to the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences.
[01:09:52.814 --> 01:10:05.298]  And we have also the data in the fold, as well as the discussions that the Pope had with Joe Biden regarding censorship.
[01:10:05.578 --> 01:10:20.303]  Because, as you remember, a couple of weeks ago, the Pope invited the social networks, the internet companies, for much tighter censorship and control of the freedom of speech.
[01:10:20.323 --> 01:10:23.084]  That definitely is something that... And that's where I was going next.
[01:10:23.164 --> 01:10:33.549]   I mean, if anybody ever doubted this black Pope, meaning Jesuit Pope, that you were the only person to predict six, seven years before it happened, he even said his name, Would be a tool of the devil.
[01:10:33.629 --> 01:10:35.991]  I mean, I'm not attacking Catholics in general.
[01:10:36.011 --> 01:10:36.952]  I'm not attacking Christians.
[01:10:37.672 --> 01:10:40.415]  And I'm not judging people, but you judge a tree by its fruits.
[01:10:40.975 --> 01:10:43.978]  I mean, this guy might as well be wearing red pajamas with a pitchfork.
[01:10:45.399 --> 01:10:46.340]  Who is he really?
[01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:48.882]  I mean, is he consciously an agent of Satan?
[01:10:48.922 --> 01:10:56.248]  Or why is he pushing such an evil, anti-Christian, world government, open borders agenda?
[01:10:58.027 --> 01:10:58.888]  He's a Jesuit.
[01:10:58.928 --> 01:11:22.162]  He's the first Jesuit Pope in history and he's being called to have a very unusual role after Ratzinger, who, as you know, was forced to resign by the Jesuit Mafia that is basically the one behind his resignation, known as the Mafia of St.
[01:11:22.202 --> 01:11:23.963]  Gallen in Switzerland.
[01:11:24.603 --> 01:11:49.478]  So, what happened is that this Pope has a mission, which is to completely destroy any remain of Christianity within the Catholic faith, which was already a shrink of the last remains during the Second Vatican Council, which was this important gathering that reformalized the Catholic faith in the early, until the middle of the 60s.
[01:11:49.539 --> 01:11:51.560]  It took place in the first half of the 1960s.
[01:11:53.821 --> 01:12:12.978]  And this event was very important because Freemasonry, which is now completely corrupt, took control of this Vatican Council and literally gave birth to what is now being unleashed fully by Pope Francis.
[01:12:13.179 --> 01:12:23.688]   This one world religion, ideology, That also is of course putting on a pedestal science, not God in the end.
[01:12:23.708 --> 01:12:29.534]  It is science that Pope Francis worshipped, not God.
[01:12:29.594 --> 01:12:33.878]  Isn't that a breaking point for a lot of traditional Catholics and people, period, that have any morals?
[01:12:34.984 --> 01:12:43.127]  That these vaccines are made with fetal tissue and dead people's tissue, and just from a health perspective you shouldn't take that.
[01:12:43.827 --> 01:12:47.968]  A lot of the big Orthodox Jewish councils are saying don't take it, period, because of that.
[01:12:47.988 --> 01:12:50.049]  But he's telling us we need to take this.
[01:12:50.089 --> 01:12:53.450]  In fact, he said basically, you're not a Christian if you don't.
[01:12:53.950 --> 01:12:55.511]  That sounds pretty evil to me.
[01:12:57.398 --> 01:13:08.506]  Yes, and thanks God we have still some voices of dissent like we discussed earlier this morning with the American General Harrison.
[01:13:08.526 --> 01:13:16.151]  Yes, the Archbishop Vigano, this figure that used to be the Vatican representative here in the U.S.
[01:13:16.211 --> 01:13:18.853]  until 2016, he has warned U.S.
[01:13:18.953 --> 01:13:20.434]  bishops about the COVID jab.
[01:13:20.834 --> 01:13:26.957]  He actually warned them and said the Great Reset wants billions of chronically ill people.
[01:13:27.398 --> 01:13:27.898]  That's right.
[01:13:27.918 --> 01:13:28.498]  He just came out.
[01:13:28.538 --> 01:13:29.599]  That's why I wanted to get you on, too.
[01:13:29.639 --> 01:13:31.520]  In fact, I was already wanting to get you on before I started with Harrison.
[01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:33.801]  When we come back, I want to ask you about the particular bishop.
[01:13:34.481 --> 01:13:40.405]  We have a few seconds now, but he came out and said it is no one should take the shot and that it's basically poison.
[01:13:40.425 --> 01:13:44.647]  He's about the bravest major Christian figure out there right now.
[01:13:45.580 --> 01:13:47.681]  Yeah, I mean, he's a controversial figure.
[01:13:47.761 --> 01:13:57.525]  Like I said to Harrison, there is some doubts regarding him, mostly because he has never really been excommunicated and the Pope has never had the courage to kick him out.
[01:13:57.565 --> 01:14:06.229]  But I think that mostly that is because he has untold secrets and things he could use himself to blackmail the Pope.
[01:14:06.249 --> 01:14:06.710]  Absolutely.
[01:14:06.750 --> 01:14:08.651]  The Pope's scared of him, the so-called Pope.
[01:14:08.931 --> 01:14:10.211]  We'll be right back with Leo Zagami.
[01:14:10.231 --> 01:14:10.751]  Stay with us.
[01:14:11.132 --> 01:14:11.592]  I'm going to hit.
[01:14:12.805 --> 01:14:36.820]  The massive attack on Tucker Carlson, who's hit a nerve when he comes out with his new documentary series, the coup against the people, the purge against the American population that's got the system so incredibly scared, talking about false flags, the federal agents, because they want to brand the American people as the new terror threat, as the official policy of the Pentagon, the CIA, you name it, being Christian conservatives.
[01:14:38.161 --> 01:14:44.790]   That's why it's called the plot against the people is the official name, and it's Got the system scared because there's actually an American left.
[01:14:44.810 --> 01:14:48.372]  There's actually somebody with a big platform telling the truth.
[01:14:49.452 --> 01:14:50.593]  So that's coming up.
[01:14:51.193 --> 01:15:00.057]  Then we have one of the leaders of the movement in New York against forced inoculations, who's also in the top of the music charts, joining us in the last 30 minutes of the next hour.
[01:15:00.097 --> 01:15:01.277]  But going back to Leo Zegami.
[01:15:01.898 --> 01:15:09.741]   Leo, I always ask questions and you answer my questions, but You always, when I see you on other shows, when you have your own agenda, cover amazing stuff.
[01:15:10.081 --> 01:15:15.984]  What is front and center for you in the world right now with the developments with China, with the United States?
[01:15:16.044 --> 01:15:17.464]  How does the Vatican tie into this?
[01:15:17.905 --> 01:15:19.525]  Why did Biden just go to the Vatican?
[01:15:19.545 --> 01:15:22.507]  What's the inside baseball that nobody else knows but you?
[01:15:22.527 --> 01:15:27.809]  Because I know you always have stuff that nobody else knows other than the insiders and yourself because of all your contacts.
[01:15:28.109 --> 01:15:34.132]  I won't go through it, but the P2 Lodge and an insider in the Vatican and the rest of it from your aristocratic family in Italy.
[01:15:35.768 --> 01:15:54.225]  Well, the Vatican and in particular the papacy of Pope Francis is the Chinese papacy because since the beginning they have been corrupt by China receiving immense quantities of money and staying silent on the persecution even of Catholics themselves.
[01:15:54.685 --> 01:16:01.051]  Recently we had the arrest of another bishop in China and the Pope is not saying anything about it.
[01:16:01.551 --> 01:16:17.430]  Because they have also made an official deal in 2018 and this official deal is also a secret deal that we are not really allowed to know what's written in this deal between the Vatican and China.
[01:16:18.291 --> 01:16:33.924]  There has been bishops, priests in China tortured simply because they don't want to join the patriotic church and obey to the rules that are dictated not by the Vatican but rather by the Chinese Communist Party.
[01:16:34.244 --> 01:16:39.928]   Regarding the meeting of today with Joe Biden, And Pope Francis.
[01:16:40.428 --> 01:17:03.180]  Also very important is the subject of this woke ideology, which the Jesuits have been promoting in their own publication here in the US, which is called America, which is the main Jesuit publication here in the United States, which invited Catholics to literally embrace being woke as part of our faith tradition.
[01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:04.541]  I'm quoting them here.
[01:17:05.161 --> 01:17:23.992]  So they said that basically it's unjust to mock the term woke because that's something done by right-wing people and that basically we should not follow that and with the political right basically using to weaponize it.
[01:17:24.032 --> 01:18:01.918]   So a firm criticism and a full support of the woke ideology as well as critical race theory And of course, abortion, it's a very important subject today because it's being discussed by the US Conference of Bishops, which is the one that Bishop Viganò addressed with his open letter a few days ago, in which he says also all those things regarding the experimental vaccine that he calls an experimental drug that has not been approved, but only authorized for administration by the bodies in charge.
[01:18:02.538 --> 01:18:21.972]  So, he's very clear about the fact that there is a lot of danger in using these vaccines and they might ruin people and whole generations because it's not only ruining yourself, you're transmitting then this whole thing to your son, your grandson.
[01:18:21.992 --> 01:18:25.414]  That's right, it gets into your very, very genetics, creating the spike protein forever.
[01:18:25.474 --> 01:18:27.535]  It's an assault on our very DNA.
[01:18:27.635 --> 01:18:28.256]  It's synthetic.
[01:18:28.934 --> 01:18:30.035]  Let's expand on that.
[01:18:30.675 --> 01:18:35.159]  How is it affecting people that are actually conservative or Christian in the Catholic Church?
[01:18:35.859 --> 01:18:38.301]  Most Catholics I know are nice people, and they hate this Pope.
[01:18:38.682 --> 01:18:43.746]  I mean, he's so obviously not even Christian, much less following Catholic doctrines.
[01:18:43.826 --> 01:18:51.892]  I mean, he's a globalist, New World Order, transhumanist, woke monster, saying Europe shouldn't even exist, in quotes.
[01:18:51.932 --> 01:18:56.856]  So what is that generating out there with the Catholics you know, not just here, but around the world?
[01:18:57.904 --> 01:19:01.745]  Well, there is, of course, a lot of controversy, especially with traditional Catholics.
[01:19:01.785 --> 01:19:34.703]   But now, in the last couple of weeks, there is actually a controversy within the actual Society of Jesus, within the Jesuits, after two fully vaccinated Jesuits, who used to be very close to Pope Francis, died one after the other on the 13th and 14th On the 13th and 14th of October, so they died in proximity with each other, and their own funeral was celebrated in the Mother Church of the Jesuits in Rome, and apparently this has brought a lot of Jesuits who are the scientists of the Church.
[01:19:34.803 --> 01:19:35.744]  Let's not forget that.
[01:19:35.784 --> 01:19:51.652]   The Jesuits are Usually the more intellectual, the ones who are dedicated to the studies of science, and they are starting to wonder, why are we being forced into this vaccination after we have such negative results?
[01:19:51.672 --> 01:20:16.489]   So the Pope had to also fight this internal war in the last few weeks, especially because one of the two people who died, He was a very well-known priest in Africa who was fighting HIV and AIDS, so he was rather known as a dean of the Pontifical Gregorian University, which is the university, the main Jesuit university in Rome.
[01:20:17.109 --> 01:20:28.137]  So, this has definitely shocked a lot of people, the death of these two fully vaccinated Jesuits that died this month.
[01:20:28.197 --> 01:20:40.106]  And so, there is a lot of criticism towards the vaccines, but nobody's saying anything because the Pope himself says that we need to all vaccinate ourselves.
[01:20:40.786 --> 01:20:45.148]  Almost excommunicating the people who criticize the vaccines.
[01:20:45.368 --> 01:20:52.770]  So it's like you don't want to be criticized by the Pope, so basically most people stay silent.
[01:20:53.410 --> 01:21:05.094]  And we know, of course, that these two fully vaccinated Jesuits might have been immunocompromised individuals with serious problems.
[01:21:05.615 --> 01:21:09.396]  But apparently they were both in good health.
[01:21:09.976 --> 01:21:16.179]  So, as I said, even within the company of Jesus, there is some criticism.
[01:21:16.219 --> 01:21:22.181]  Well, that's the thing is we've had a lot of big CEOs and globalists die after the shots and executives in big tech.
[01:21:22.241 --> 01:21:23.941]  I mean, we're talking presidents, vice presidents.
[01:21:24.422 --> 01:21:26.182]  I mean, they're really doing it.
[01:21:26.242 --> 01:21:29.103]  They're really getting on board with the transhumanism.
[01:21:30.504 --> 01:21:32.005]  And a lot of them even have heart attacks.
[01:21:32.045 --> 01:21:37.087]  They say, oh, I'm still going to take more shots, even though I had a heart attack from it.
[01:21:37.187 --> 01:21:38.187]  It's Stockholm syndrome.
[01:21:39.818 --> 01:21:43.140]  And a lot of people ask me, but why are they killing themselves?
[01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:45.261]  Why are they suicidal?
[01:21:45.701 --> 01:21:51.745]  Well, I reply regarding, in the case of these Jesuits, I wrote an article on my website.
[01:21:52.265 --> 01:21:59.269]  The thing is that they have, of course, people who are spendable, people who are not spendable.
[01:21:59.289 --> 01:22:06.913]  I mean, if you have taken the fourth vow and you are a particular kind of Jesuit, then you might not die.
[01:22:07.052 --> 01:22:11.212]   of the vaccine because you might have probably never took the vaccine, no?
[01:22:11.212 --> 01:22:15.372]   Exactly, they only give the insiders the word on what to do and what not to do.
[01:22:15.372 --> 01:22:18.811]  And then there is another thing that happened recently.
[01:22:19.170 --> 01:22:22.372]  All the Jesuit universities in the U.S.
[01:22:22.672 --> 01:22:29.357]  have been forced into taking the vaccination, I think, aside from one, and even their seminars.
[01:22:30.578 --> 01:22:35.762]  So you can't become a Jesuit without taking the job today.
[01:22:36.242 --> 01:22:39.404]  And the same thing is for the majority of priests now.
[01:22:39.765 --> 01:22:41.866]  Most seminars are required.
[01:22:42.186 --> 01:22:43.207]  What an incredible cult.

[01:24:42.319 --> 01:24:44.080]  We don't get experts on that are experts at BS.
[01:24:44.220 --> 01:24:48.022]  We get people that are experts on being accurate for years and years and years, and he is.
[01:24:48.202 --> 01:24:52.751]   Leo, in the last five minutes we have here, Big picture, how's the New World Order going?
[01:24:52.791 --> 01:24:54.896]  How is humanity doing in the fight against it?
[01:24:55.718 --> 01:24:57.081]  The Jesuits, who are they really?
[01:24:57.181 --> 01:24:58.244]  What is the fourth right?
[01:24:58.645 --> 01:24:59.467]  Let people know about that.
[01:25:00.842 --> 01:25:12.450]  Yes, the fourth vow of a Jesuit brings them in an elite unit which takes orders that can be even extreme, like killing somebody.
[01:25:12.530 --> 01:25:15.832]  I mean, they act like secret agents for the Vatican.
[01:25:15.852 --> 01:25:20.855]  The Jesuits are the main force within the Vatican intelligence.
[01:25:20.975 --> 01:25:25.859]  So this fourth vow is only for some Jesuits, not for everybody.
[01:25:25.899 --> 01:25:34.045]   That's why at times you might meet Jesuits who don't really know Hillary once asked, what is her world philosophy?
[01:25:33.945 --> 01:25:37.745]  They are kept below what this elite unit...
[01:25:37.745 --> 01:25:43.665]   Hillary once asked what is her world philosophy and she said "Jewitical."
[01:25:43.665 --> 01:25:52.025]   The philosophy here is basically Sabbatean Frankist philosophy mixed with what the Jesuits
[01:25:52.025 --> 01:25:57.705]   have picked up here and there during their almost 500 years of history.
[01:25:57.881 --> 01:26:06.570]  You see, there is this alliance between the Jesuits and the Sabbatean Frankists, which are themselves an heresy within Judaism.
[01:26:06.870 --> 01:26:08.232]  Sure, and I was just quoting Hillary.
[01:26:08.272 --> 01:26:12.155]  She said, my worldview is Jewetical, meaning from the Jesuits.
[01:26:12.496 --> 01:26:13.617]  But yeah, she's crazy.
[01:26:14.565 --> 01:26:25.627]  Yes, like I said, the Jesuits are an inspiration for all these people, and of course they were an inspiration even to the SS of Himmler.
[01:26:25.707 --> 01:26:43.170]   So, I mean, the way they are so solemn, and they take this solemn vow that really brings them not only to take the vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience, but also this extra expression of obedience and complete obedience and
[01:26:43.170 --> 01:26:47.729]   submission to the Pope regarding certain missions, well, makes them a very special order.
[01:26:47.729 --> 01:26:53.930]   That's why they came together right at the start of this counter-reformation from the
[01:26:53.930 --> 01:27:00.650]   Church and Ignazio Loiola was a member of the Illuminati of that time called the Alumbrados.
[01:27:00.650 --> 01:27:07.650]   And some people say he was also connected to the Arab faction of the Jewish tradition
[01:27:07.650 --> 01:27:13.890]   which is born back at the time when Moses went out of Egypt and brought with him all
[01:27:13.890 --> 01:27:17.609]  those high priests with him, not only Jews.
[01:27:17.598 --> 01:27:18.458]  The Sanhedrin.
[01:27:18.698 --> 01:27:19.339]  The Sanhedrin.
[01:27:19.899 --> 01:27:21.379]  And then that goes further, though.
[01:27:22.019 --> 01:27:23.060]  That goes further, doesn't it?
[01:27:23.080 --> 01:27:27.821]  That ties in to Adam Weishaupt, who was a Jesuit, but was also a part of that Jewish order.
[01:27:28.519 --> 01:27:30.239]  And he's the founder of the modern Illuminati.
[01:27:31.380 --> 01:27:32.000]  Absolutely.
[01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:39.661]  Founder of the modern Illuminati, who brought this political element into the secret societies.
[01:27:39.721 --> 01:27:45.222]  How to manipulate, infiltrate, and mainly focus on the politics.
[01:27:45.422 --> 01:27:51.863]  Because up until then, the secret society were mainly focused on the esoteric, on the magical side of things.
[01:27:52.103 --> 01:27:54.003]  How's the New World Order going for him?
[01:27:54.063 --> 01:27:57.004]  It seems like they're pushing ahead with it, but it seems like it's having a lot of problems.
[01:27:58.148 --> 01:28:23.077]  Well, last week there was a very important meeting regarding artificial intelligence in the Vatican with the Illuminati, and then this meeting carried on also outside of the Vatican and in the Collegium Germanicum, which is part of the, basically, those priests of German language who study to become priests, they all go to this Collegium Germanicum.
[01:28:23.377 --> 01:28:30.104]  However, there was a very important meeting because they discussed the artificial intelligence in regards to religion.
[01:28:31.341 --> 01:28:33.442]  And this topic was very important.
[01:28:33.742 --> 01:28:35.043]  And then transhumanism.
[01:28:35.463 --> 01:28:49.168]  They had even the authors of the Transhumanist Code, which is a very important book, considered a very important book by those who, of course, follow this twisted ideology.
[01:28:49.208 --> 01:28:52.950]  So the Vatican wants to be really on top of it all.
[01:28:53.130 --> 01:28:59.152]  I mean, they have, of course, control of everything that goes on in Silicon Valley.
[01:28:59.472 --> 01:29:02.873]  And they've got their own radio, telescopes, they've got their regular telescopes.
[01:29:02.913 --> 01:29:08.536]  They are definitely on the ball with a lot of things and going along with the transhumanist movement.
[01:29:08.576 --> 01:29:09.756]  LeoZagami.com.
[01:29:10.076 --> 01:29:16.118]  I haven't asked you yet on air, but the crew's going to ask you if you can join me tomorrow for a Saturday special show because I want you to be able to elaborate more.
[01:29:16.158 --> 01:29:16.499]  You can?
[01:29:16.519 --> 01:29:18.119]  Fantastic.
[01:29:18.159 --> 01:29:19.080]  We'll check with Leo Zagami.
[01:29:19.100 --> 01:29:19.640]  Thank you, Leo.
[01:29:19.980 --> 01:29:22.781]  We'll be right back with a bunch of breaking news I haven't gotten to yet.
[01:29:23.783 --> 01:29:30.591]  On a host of fronts, including their attempt to trigger a civil war in this country and how we stop it back in 60 seconds.
[01:29:30.631 --> 01:29:31.512]  Thank you, Leo Zegami.
[01:29:32.672 --> 01:29:42.511]   And we are now into our number three and beyond on this Friday, October 29th, 2021 transmission.
[01:29:42.511 --> 01:29:48.591]   You know, every time I think I know it all, I learn a lot more.
[01:29:48.863 --> 01:29:52.026]  And I already knew a lot of this, but I didn't realize how far along they were.
[01:29:52.647 --> 01:29:57.150]  I didn't know the Davos Group until my great producer, Scott Bronson, came in here.
[01:29:57.411 --> 01:29:58.992]  And this is a real name, pretty cool name, huh?
[01:29:59.452 --> 01:30:05.397]  Scott came in here, and he gave me these articles about an hour and a half ago.
[01:30:06.098 --> 01:30:11.683]  And so during the break, I just kept going through these and checking them and going and looking, and it's on the Davos Group's website.
[01:30:13.755 --> 01:30:26.263]  That they've already moved ahead with world regulators to start putting nanotech in your food that's, quote, artificial synthetic vaccines and, quote, for your safety, whatever that means.
[01:30:29.165 --> 01:30:32.287]  And that now because of food shortages, they're going to have to feed you nanotech.
[01:30:34.048 --> 01:30:35.149]  You know, that sounds horrible.
[01:30:35.189 --> 01:30:36.050]  That sounds fake.
[01:30:36.090 --> 01:30:37.771]  That sounds like a science fiction nightmare movie.
[01:30:39.312 --> 01:30:40.513]  Sounds like something from the new Matrix.
[01:30:42.281 --> 01:30:45.483]  But you see, saying you'll own nothing and like it is the same thing.
[01:30:47.103 --> 01:30:51.105]  Saying, oh, we got a convicted pedophile coming by to visit with your five-year-olds at school.
[01:30:52.566 --> 01:30:53.546]  They're going to sit on their lap.
[01:30:54.047 --> 01:30:55.127]  You're like, that sounds insane.
[01:30:55.647 --> 01:30:56.808]  It's all insane.
[01:30:56.848 --> 01:30:59.129]  It's all meant to just get you to totally roll over.
[01:30:59.149 --> 01:31:01.010]  Things are getting hit from so many angles.
[01:31:02.411 --> 01:31:06.893]  So like I said, tomorrow, 5 p.m., we're going to have an emergency transmission on that subject and more.
[01:31:08.021 --> 01:31:09.402]  That will basically be commercial-free.
[01:31:09.422 --> 01:31:16.988]  And by commercial-free, we won't go to the regular network breaks for radio and TV stations that are 14 minutes an hour standard clock.
[01:31:17.008 --> 01:31:19.910]  We'll just have a few breaks here and there, but I'm gonna go for a couple hours tomorrow.
[01:31:20.050 --> 01:31:21.671]  Look for that 5 p.m.
[01:31:21.691 --> 01:31:24.313]  Central, the emergency Saturday transmission.
[01:31:24.353 --> 01:31:26.154]  And remember, the only way this gets out is you warning them.
[01:31:26.655 --> 01:31:29.016]  Okay, here's the next big piece of news.
[01:31:29.977 --> 01:31:33.179]  And I started the broadcast with this a little bit today, but I want to get back into it right now.
[01:31:34.280 --> 01:31:35.181]  It all ties together.
[01:31:35.961 --> 01:31:47.866]   House Bill Has the legislation in it to track every transaction you make for a social credit score and track transactions down to $600 total.
[01:31:49.207 --> 01:31:52.348]  Also $10,000 a year total in your account, you'll also be tracked.
[01:31:53.029 --> 01:31:54.169]  That means everybody will be tracked.
[01:31:54.650 --> 01:31:59.472]  Total violation of your rights, the Fourth Amendment, total police state right out of the Soviet Union.
[01:31:59.752 --> 01:32:01.854]  But it's okay because, you know, they're liberal.
[01:32:01.894 --> 01:32:02.354]  It's all right.
[01:32:03.351 --> 01:32:03.871]  Here's another one.
[01:32:04.352 --> 01:32:11.417]  Biden gang reportedly running secret list used to prevent outspoken political opponents from owning guns.
[01:32:11.577 --> 01:32:13.738]  Laura Loomer speaks out on the injustice.
[01:32:14.019 --> 01:32:16.120]  It's an excellent article from gatewaypundit.com.
[01:32:16.660 --> 01:32:25.627]  And I went to buy two shotguns a few days ago at Cabela's because I got a couple other hunting shotguns.
[01:32:26.400 --> 01:32:32.425]  We're dove hunting and quail hunting and turkey hunting, but they're in East Texas and on my dad's property.
[01:32:32.465 --> 01:32:34.707]  And I just said, you know, I'm gonna go buy a couple more shotguns.
[01:32:35.007 --> 01:32:40.331]  I went and bought some semi-auto hunting shotguns and never had this happen.
[01:32:40.351 --> 01:32:41.052]  It's all digital.
[01:32:41.072 --> 01:32:43.353]  They flagged all these names of people named Jones.
[01:32:44.394 --> 01:32:51.700]  You know, this person named Jones, you know, that person named, they listed like eight people named Jones, Kara Jones, John Jones, all this stuff.
[01:32:52.751 --> 01:32:54.353]  And I said, no, I don't know any of those people.
[01:32:54.373 --> 01:32:59.578]  They said, well, you've been flagged as a straw purchaser in here to buy them for somebody else and sell them illegally.
[01:33:00.737 --> 01:33:02.458]  Well, I mean, Jones is a common name.
[01:33:02.578 --> 01:33:04.099]  What if I'd have had somebody name that?
[01:33:04.500 --> 01:33:06.941]  But that's all just because they're putting me in a database, folks.
[01:33:07.281 --> 01:33:09.163]  That's what this whole database system is about.
[01:33:09.543 --> 01:33:13.826]  Starts out with a good reason for it on the surface, but below it, it's just pure evil and bad.
[01:33:13.866 --> 01:33:15.467]  And Laura Loomer cannot get a gun.
[01:33:15.527 --> 01:33:17.068]  She's on a straw purchaser list.
[01:33:17.448 --> 01:33:18.689]  She's never owned a gun.
[01:33:19.189 --> 01:33:20.070]  She's getting death threats.
[01:33:20.090 --> 01:33:21.131]  She's running for Congress.
[01:33:21.731 --> 01:33:24.413]  And now she can't get a gun, can't get an Uber, can't get a bank account.
[01:33:24.813 --> 01:33:27.355]  Because she's on the de-platforming list.
[01:33:28.196 --> 01:33:28.997]  And so are we.
[01:33:29.117 --> 01:33:32.020]  We just have fought and gotten around it for now.
[01:33:32.700 --> 01:33:34.922]  So that's the real danger, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:34.942 --> 01:33:36.344]  That's what we're dealing with as a society.
[01:33:37.424 --> 01:33:45.203]   And that leads us to the trailer for Tucker Carlson's new show, The Plot against the people, and that's what this is.
[01:33:45.223 --> 01:33:46.085]  I mean the official U.S.
[01:33:46.105 --> 01:33:55.782]  government policy, I've been hammering since June, is to say the American people that want guns, or controlled borders, or question elections, or question lockdowns, or forced inoculations.
[01:33:56.772 --> 01:33:58.053]  That's half the public at least.
[01:33:58.394 --> 01:34:03.318]  We're all terrorists, and the Pentagon's watching us, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs said that.
[01:34:03.959 --> 01:34:05.100]  That discredits them.
[01:34:05.140 --> 01:34:06.181]  It doesn't make us terrorists.
[01:34:06.441 --> 01:34:08.503]  That makes them a third-world dictatorship.
[01:34:08.763 --> 01:34:10.004]  That makes them bad people.
[01:34:10.045 --> 01:34:11.826]  That makes them the globalists.
[01:34:11.926 --> 01:34:18.513]  And so then Tucker Carlson comes out and does a well-produced piece, and wait till they find out who's in it.
[01:34:18.553 --> 01:34:19.854]  They're really going to crap their britches.
[01:34:20.866 --> 01:34:22.287]  And they are just freaking out.
[01:34:22.307 --> 01:34:25.649]  But I can tell you the inside baseball, it's not secret, but it's not well known.
[01:34:26.230 --> 01:34:29.012]  Tucker took a lot less money to have total control of his show.
[01:34:30.313 --> 01:34:32.874]  Number one show in the world right now for news on TV.
[01:34:33.575 --> 01:34:36.637]  And he basically has total freedom, but at a great cost.
[01:34:36.657 --> 01:34:40.500]  So he paid the majority of what he makes to be able to have that decision.
[01:34:40.780 --> 01:34:42.081]  And that's why I respect him even more.
[01:34:42.321 --> 01:34:43.262]  He's the real deal, folks.
[01:34:43.282 --> 01:34:45.283]  He's born again hard, as they say.
[01:34:45.323 --> 01:34:46.484]  He's awakened.
[01:34:47.156 --> 01:34:51.299]  And now he knows for certain how serious it is, and they've got a big problem.
[01:34:51.339 --> 01:34:55.301]  So here's the trailer for the show that starts premiering next Monday.
[01:34:55.341 --> 01:34:55.881]  Here it is.
[01:34:57.782 --> 01:35:02.885]  What you're about to see is part of our soon-to-be-released three-part series for Tucker Carlson Originals.
[01:35:02.946 --> 01:35:04.326]  It's called Patriot Purge.
[01:35:04.627 --> 01:35:05.987]  It debuts November 1st.
[01:35:06.248 --> 01:35:34.931]   Here's The helicopters have left Afghanistan, and now they've landed here at home.
[01:35:35.311 --> 01:35:43.054]  And the left is hunting the right, sticking them in Guantanamo Bay for American citizens, leaving them there to rot.
[01:35:43.214 --> 01:35:45.955]  We are dealing with an insurgency in the United States.
[01:35:45.975 --> 01:35:50.377]  Terrorism and white supremacy is the most lethal threat to homeland.
[01:35:51.037 --> 01:35:53.198]  I've been told that I'm a white nationalist.
[01:35:53.018 --> 01:36:02.738]   me. They've begun to fight a new enemy in a new war on terror. Not all kind of white supremacy. False flags have
[01:36:02.738 --> 01:36:05.337]  happened in this country.
[01:36:05.337 --> 01:36:10.337]  (Demonic voices)
[01:36:10.085 --> 01:36:13.147]  One of which may have been January 6th.
[01:36:13.187 --> 01:36:18.671]  Great job, Tucker Carlson!
[01:36:20.416 --> 01:36:21.977]  Wow, can't wait to see that.
[01:36:22.737 --> 01:36:31.742]  Joy Reid and others, I've got a stack of like 30 articles here about it, literally, here they are, saying, oh, Alex Jones is evil, oh, Tucker Carlson is now a white supremacist, oh, he denies the Holocaust.
[01:36:32.042 --> 01:36:32.903]  It's a talking point.
[01:36:34.069 --> 01:36:36.431]  Even on Fox News against him with Geraldo Rivera.
[01:36:36.691 --> 01:36:37.712]  Who needs Alex Jones?
[01:36:37.732 --> 01:36:42.516]  Tucker Carlson's upcoming special calling January 6th a tat false flag draws outrage.
[01:36:42.956 --> 01:36:47.560]  Tucker Carlson talks January 6th denial to chilling level with Patriot Purge.
[01:36:47.580 --> 01:36:48.520]  He's Alex Jones.
[01:36:49.301 --> 01:36:51.803]  On and on and on and on.
[01:36:52.143 --> 01:36:56.767]  Media matters and George Soros and that weasel creature, the possum, Oliver Darcy.
[01:36:57.527 --> 01:36:58.388]  The London Independent.
[01:36:58.448 --> 01:37:02.391]  It's just they're all freaking out about the term false flag and Joy Reid.
[01:37:02.851 --> 01:37:04.093]  Again, he's a white supremacist.
[01:37:04.113 --> 01:37:05.474]  He's all these crazy things.
[01:37:05.654 --> 01:37:10.079]  Hey, Joy, you talking about Fauci with all the black foster children he tested AIDS drugs on until they died?
[01:37:10.479 --> 01:37:10.680]  No.
[01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:12.762]  That's who you are, Joy Reid.
[01:37:12.802 --> 01:37:13.983]  You help people that do that.
[01:37:14.223 --> 01:37:14.724]  Here she is.
[01:37:15.705 --> 01:37:19.329]  Well, if you took a snapshot of the country right now, here is what you'd see.
[01:37:20.130 --> 01:37:22.172]  On the one hand, you have all that war.
[01:37:23.030 --> 01:37:30.217]  As the American right and the party it has consumed, the Trumpist Republican Party, takes aim at every civic and cultural institution.
[01:37:30.697 --> 01:37:34.580]  From whether we live or die from COVID to our schools and history and democracy itself.
[01:37:35.041 --> 01:37:40.586]  Banning books, senators defending Nazi salutes and unhinged anti-vax protests at school boards.
[01:37:41.066 --> 01:37:45.050]  And the most popular conservative cable news host going full Alex Jones.
[01:37:45.655 --> 01:37:50.237]  ...promoting a fringe conspiracy theory about the January 6th insurrection being a false flag.
[01:37:50.277 --> 01:37:52.218]  So that is all happening.
[01:37:52.238 --> 01:38:08.425]  One of the guests on Tuckum's show last night, shortly after he unveiled his propaganda to rewrite the January 6th insurrection, was Glenn Youngkin, the Republican candidate for governor of Virginia, the new poster child for the Republicans' current twisted priority of banning books when they're not trying to reenact Fahrenheit 451.
[01:38:08.546 --> 01:38:09.406]  Okay, you stop.
[01:38:09.446 --> 01:38:10.666]  I can't hear anymore of it.
[01:38:10.686 --> 01:38:11.747]  You want to see the whole thing?
[01:38:11.767 --> 01:38:13.648]  It's on Infowars.com, the article about it.
[01:38:14.870 --> 01:38:17.251]  Joy Reid, folks, we're burning books.
[01:38:17.331 --> 01:38:18.812]  Conservatives are burning books.
[01:38:19.632 --> 01:38:27.835]  No, saying you don't want pedophilia books, and I've seen them, checked out of the library for 6th and 7th graders, where it shows children having sex with adults.
[01:38:29.476 --> 01:38:31.657]  I mean, I'd never seen child porn until I saw that.
[01:38:32.457 --> 01:38:35.058]  We can't show it to you on TV, but 6th graders can see it.
[01:38:35.618 --> 01:38:36.859]  I don't want to show it to you on TV.
[01:38:36.899 --> 01:38:39.720]  So, that's who these people are, and they're a joke.
[01:38:40.797 --> 01:38:41.917]  But they know they're a joke.
[01:38:42.297 --> 01:38:44.818]  They know the big corporations have lost support of the people.
[01:38:45.238 --> 01:38:51.879]  So now they're bringing in a worldwide totalitarian forced inoculation regime for a world ID and the shot makes us sick.
[01:38:52.439 --> 01:39:00.041]  We'll talk to a leading activist and a top musician at the top of the charts who's helping lead the fight in New York against the unprecedented tyranny.
[01:39:00.521 --> 01:39:02.261]  The globalists think New York's their beachhead.
[01:39:02.861 --> 01:39:06.422]  I say it's where they're going to lose their fight in the information war.
[01:39:06.322 --> 01:39:29.922]  We'll be right back, straight ahead.
[01:39:29.684 --> 01:39:35.844]   Stay inside the line, nothing feeling right Something's always holding us down
[01:39:35.844 --> 01:39:48.324]   I, I, I'm so afraid I, I, I question things
[01:39:48.324 --> 01:40:01.284]   So wake up, you know this ain't over You got one eye open, we'll find a way out
[01:40:01.284 --> 01:40:08.324]   We're breaking the matrix Wake up, we'll rise like we're the sun
[01:40:08.324 --> 01:40:11.684]   I tell you, I don't want to go to our guests 'cause I want to keep listening to this song.
[01:40:11.851 --> 01:40:13.412]  Because I don't follow the music charts.
[01:40:13.512 --> 01:40:14.713]  I don't pay attention to all that stuff.
[01:40:14.753 --> 01:40:19.877]  I'm so busy covering news, but their music's been so big, I've already been listening to it and watching it for weeks.
[01:40:20.617 --> 01:40:25.221]  So we've got anti-lockdown, anti-poison vax, anti-Joe Biden songs.
[01:40:26.002 --> 01:40:31.586]  Just yesterday, today, what, four of the top ten on the main billboards, even though they're trying to censor it.
[01:40:32.498 --> 01:40:33.478]  It's pretty amazing.
[01:40:34.038 --> 01:40:35.639]  So Jimmy Levy is our guest.
[01:40:36.059 --> 01:40:44.440]  He is a number one billboard charting and multi-platinum recording artist from South Florida who's taken the EDM and hip-hop scene by storm.
[01:40:44.921 --> 01:40:54.762]  Jimmy was a Hollywood finalist on season 18 of American Idol and since then he released multiple dance hits, two of which topped the dance and rap hip-hop charts simultaneously.
[01:40:55.143 --> 01:41:01.447]   Both The Matrix and This Is War ...are inspired by the process of waking up to the New World Order agenda.
[01:41:01.807 --> 01:41:14.519]  After finding his way back to God and being sober for a few months, Jimmy is now working on his next project, War of the Mind, where he will speak on the spiritual and psychological warfare that has blinded humanity as a whole.
[01:41:14.959 --> 01:41:15.219]  Wow!
[01:41:15.279 --> 01:41:18.042]  Talk about the Great Awakening versus the Great Reset.
[01:41:18.142 --> 01:41:18.582]  It's on!
[01:41:18.883 --> 01:41:21.285]  So, Jimmy Levy, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:41:21.325 --> 01:41:23.207]  Honey, you've also been part of the demonstrations in New York.
[01:41:23.667 --> 01:41:24.247]  Thank you, brother.
[01:41:24.267 --> 01:41:24.767]  Nice to meet you.
[01:41:24.587 --> 01:41:26.506]  your take on that, but we salute you.
[01:41:26.506 --> 01:41:29.627]  And I gotta tell you, your music's awesome, brother.
[01:41:29.627 --> 01:41:31.107]  Thank you, brother, nice to meet you.
[01:41:31.107 --> 01:41:32.506]  Thank you for having me.
[01:41:32.506 --> 01:41:34.266]  Wow, absolutely, well congratulations.
[01:41:34.266 --> 01:41:39.067]   You've been successful for years, but now you're going right to the top, and it's freedom.
[01:41:39.067 --> 01:41:41.946]  So that's gotta really be scaring the establishment.
[01:41:41.946 --> 01:41:46.547]   It's not all the normal devil worshipers and people having sex with the devil and stuff
[01:41:46.547 --> 01:41:49.187]  that are top of the charts, it's you.
[01:41:49.187 --> 01:41:56.426]   Yes, I believe up until recently, I got baptized in July and I started living for God.
[01:41:56.488 --> 01:41:58.249]  And everything in my life came together.
[01:41:58.269 --> 01:42:01.672]  I believe when you do that, when you put God first, everything comes together.
[01:42:02.653 --> 01:42:11.161]  But before that, I think all artists as a whole, they can either have God living through them or Satan, especially because Satan is the angel of music.
[01:42:11.241 --> 01:42:14.084]  Satan has run this music industry for so long.
[01:42:14.705 --> 01:42:23.312]  And they have those spirits, those demons, channeling through them to give hypnosis to the children so that they get brainwashed by the violence.
[01:42:23.993 --> 01:42:30.034]  The sex that they're putting out, the drugs, the alcohol, they want them in that hypnosis to keep them in the matrix.
[01:42:30.554 --> 01:42:33.455]  So now that I found God, my lyrics have changed.
[01:42:33.895 --> 01:42:38.396]  You know, God has always given me my voice, but it was just the content I was putting out.
[01:42:38.436 --> 01:42:40.656]  There were other spirits channeling through me before.
[01:42:41.176 --> 01:42:47.098]  Now I have, you know, full out, gone with freedom and, and, you know, I'm the most happy I've ever been.
[01:42:47.598 --> 01:42:48.378]  Wow, that is heavy.
[01:42:48.418 --> 01:42:51.679]  Have you ever seen Bob Dylan on 60 Minutes say that he sold his soul to the devil?
[01:42:52.059 --> 01:42:53.679]  And then as soon as he did that, he was given power?
[01:42:55.057 --> 01:42:57.519]  Yeah, my mom knew Bob Dylan.
[01:42:57.959 --> 01:43:03.884]  He wanted to, I think he wanted to date her and she already was like married with my dad or getting married with him.
[01:43:04.785 --> 01:43:05.686]  Well, that's amazing.
[01:43:06.406 --> 01:43:12.738]   Again, I like Bob Dylan too, but he admits that and this is very Very serious, and that's very deep what you said.
[01:43:13.118 --> 01:43:16.560]  Satan tries to convince you with his spirit that he's going to give you gifts.
[01:43:16.680 --> 01:43:25.546]  God gives you the gifts, and then you can turn those towards the use of Satan, and that's really why Satan wants to control humans, because we're really more powerful than Satan, we just don't know it.
[01:43:26.687 --> 01:43:27.228]  Exactly.
[01:43:27.688 --> 01:43:32.431]  And they diminish us with all of the psychological warfare to make us think we're so small.
[01:43:32.691 --> 01:43:38.368]   And that's why, you know, we see all of these people being scared of the government and they're showing it, you
[01:43:38.368 --> 01:43:41.188]  know. Those are all demons of deception, demons of fear.
[01:43:41.188 --> 01:43:48.868]   Wow, so I mean, you say you just woke up in the last six months or so or less. What was that process like?
[01:43:48.868 --> 01:43:57.988]   Well, you know, I was around a lot of people in the music industry and right now, like, my goal
[01:43:57.988 --> 01:44:01.748]  is to show them that it's not over for them.
[01:44:01.965 --> 01:44:04.168]  Because, you know, they saw my face.
[01:44:04.668 --> 01:44:05.810]  There's a lot of big names.
[01:44:06.170 --> 01:44:07.792]  They saw my face as I was coming up.
[01:44:08.193 --> 01:44:08.934]  I was in front of them.
[01:44:08.994 --> 01:44:09.615]  I sang for them.
[01:44:09.655 --> 01:44:10.716]  I was in the studio with them.
[01:44:11.357 --> 01:44:13.138]  And they know exactly what they're doing.
[01:44:13.178 --> 01:44:15.778]  They know exactly what's happening and they're getting paid.
[01:44:16.299 --> 01:44:27.722]  You know, it took for me a few times to get offered to speak about the lockdown on my platforms and just seeing other people do the same thing and knowing that they got paid to be like, this is enough already.
[01:44:28.202 --> 01:44:36.532]   The beginning of the whole pandemic or plandemic, whatever it is, I saw, you know, what was going on.
[01:44:36.612 --> 01:44:37.353]  I didn't like it.
[01:44:37.593 --> 01:44:39.654]  And, you know, I wasn't sober at the time.
[01:44:39.674 --> 01:44:42.256]  I actually took acid and I watched the Truman Show.
[01:44:42.556 --> 01:44:42.876]  Okay.
[01:44:43.677 --> 01:44:47.499]  And right after that, I was, I had this like awakening.
[01:44:47.619 --> 01:44:48.780]  I was like, I was with my friends.
[01:44:48.800 --> 01:44:50.221]  I was like, everything's fake.
[01:44:50.361 --> 01:44:51.701]  Well, what's going on right now?
[01:44:51.761 --> 01:44:55.504]  Like, nah, this is not, this is right now what we're in.
[01:44:55.944 --> 01:45:00.727]  They're locking us down because they're doing some cell towers outside to push out radiation.
[01:45:01.107 --> 01:45:02.267]  It's not just a lockdown.
[01:45:02.327 --> 01:45:03.468]  It's not just a sickness.
[01:45:03.748 --> 01:45:04.748]  There's something more than that.
[01:45:05.008 --> 01:45:08.710]  And now you see all of the biggest artists in the world promoting it.
[01:45:08.790 --> 01:45:14.812]  And then I look in my emails and I see that I got offered like a little amount here and then the amounts got bigger.
[01:45:15.132 --> 01:45:17.413]  And then I see all my... I talked to some of my influencer friends.
[01:45:17.453 --> 01:45:20.374]  They're getting paid to promote and just talk about the lockdown.
[01:45:20.714 --> 01:45:26.256]  And that's a whole psychological warfare in order to normalize it to the masses because they know that the kids are not listening to the doctors.
[01:45:26.596 --> 01:45:28.157]  The kids are not listening to the health official.
[01:45:28.218 --> 01:45:33.182]  They're listening to their favorite TikTok influencers, their favorite musicians, and their favorite actors.
[01:45:33.662 --> 01:45:34.803]  So I want to change that.
[01:45:34.843 --> 01:45:41.830]  I want to show them, stop being scared, give up the money, give up your- get out of your mansions, give up your Ferrari, whatever it is.
[01:45:42.530 --> 01:45:44.712]  You leave the earth with all of that.
[01:45:44.752 --> 01:45:46.533]  You don't have any of that stuff when you leave.
[01:45:47.033 --> 01:45:47.714]  It doesn't matter.
[01:45:47.734 --> 01:45:48.474]  Absolutely.
[01:45:48.494 --> 01:45:52.537]  That's why they want to make you so poor that they control what you do just for enough food.
[01:45:52.877 --> 01:45:58.201]  But once you've got transportation and food and everything, the real value is being close to God and being free.
[01:45:58.521 --> 01:46:07.685]   That's why they want to make the general public so incredibly poor and non-essential and on a universal income that they can then dictate our spiritual surrender under the social credit score.
[01:46:07.685 --> 01:46:12.484]   That's what's so evil about the anti-crash plan we now see rolling out against humanity.
[01:46:12.484 --> 01:46:17.485]   Right, just like the Black Mirror episode where they look at you and they go,
[01:46:17.485 --> 01:46:19.525]  that's exactly what they're trying to do.
[01:46:21.080 --> 01:46:26.306]  So expanding on your songs, because I mean, I'd already heard The Matrix and This is a War.
[01:46:26.326 --> 01:46:27.787]  I can't wait to hear the new one.
[01:46:28.208 --> 01:46:29.810]  I've seen a music video you're in.
[01:46:29.850 --> 01:46:31.311]  And again, I'm not paying attention to any of this.
[01:46:31.832 --> 01:46:36.177]  So you, number one, I mean, that's got to really freak out the establishment.
[01:46:37.583 --> 01:46:38.423]  Yeah.
[01:46:39.204 --> 01:46:43.685]  I got a lot of calls from labels basically saying, how did you guys do this?
[01:46:43.765 --> 01:46:45.526]  What are you doing to manipulate the sales?
[01:46:45.886 --> 01:46:47.086]  And I said, you know what?
[01:46:47.186 --> 01:46:56.749]  If you have such a problem with the movement that I'm doing, you should tell your artists to stand up for freedom and not come and try to discredit me and insult me.
[01:46:57.030 --> 01:46:58.610]  And right after that, they tried to sign me.
[01:46:58.650 --> 01:47:00.551]  And I was like, no, you just insulted us.
[01:47:00.931 --> 01:47:02.211]  Then I had another situation.
[01:47:02.231 --> 01:47:11.478]   The day before This Is A War came out, Res, the rapper on the song, was gonna get a deal for another song he has coming out, and they looked at his information.
[01:47:11.498 --> 01:47:13.680]  They said, nope, you collaborated with Jimmy Levy.
[01:47:13.800 --> 01:47:15.081]  He's too controversial.
[01:47:15.381 --> 01:47:17.002]  We're not gonna give you the big deal anymore.
[01:47:17.022 --> 01:47:20.505]  He was gonna get a lot of money to, like, as an advance to do whatever with it.
[01:47:20.585 --> 01:47:22.326]  And he said, so wait a minute.
[01:47:22.426 --> 01:47:32.114]  You allow artists to talk about sex, drugs, all this other things, but freedom of choice and just freedom and love and unity for all is so controversial?
[01:47:32.314 --> 01:47:32.774]  Goodbye.
[01:47:32.894 --> 01:47:33.415]  And they hung up.
[01:47:34.033 --> 01:47:35.996]  Like those little things is the reality.
[01:47:36.036 --> 01:47:38.099]  And it's going to be a lot worse under the social credit scores.
[01:47:38.119 --> 01:47:38.880]  We've got to fight now.
[01:47:38.900 --> 01:47:39.240]  And you're right.
[01:47:39.261 --> 01:47:39.841]  They're rolling out the 5G.
[01:47:39.861 --> 01:47:42.585]  They're rolling out the nanoparticles in the food.
[01:47:42.685 --> 01:47:44.067]  They're rolling everything out now.
[01:47:45.683 --> 01:47:54.127]  This is a GMO assault on our bodies and all of it is to block, scientifically this is proven, literally our residents to the higher dimensions.
[01:47:54.147 --> 01:47:55.768]  They know it's there, they're trying to block it.
[01:47:56.208 --> 01:47:57.889]  This is a war on religion.
[01:47:57.909 --> 01:48:01.291]  This is a war on the children.
[01:48:01.311 --> 01:48:04.413]  They give you the cure with the sickness.
[01:48:04.953 --> 01:48:07.214]  This is a war on tradition.
[01:48:07.234 --> 01:48:09.895]  This is a war on religion.
[01:48:09.915 --> 01:48:12.737]  This is a war on the children.
[01:48:13.317 --> 01:48:17.817]   They can't go with the sickness This is a war
[01:48:17.817 --> 01:48:20.817]   This is a war This is a war that we living through
[01:48:20.817 --> 01:48:24.317]   Never reveal to you that they also leaving killing you They don't tell you what the hell you agreeing to
[01:48:24.317 --> 01:48:27.317]   Shaving or hurting you, don't know who leading you Keep on proceeding to follow, your mind is so hollow
[01:48:27.317 --> 01:48:29.317]   Are you being coddled by government swallowing up everything
[01:48:29.317 --> 01:48:33.086]   That the media tell you without a question or a problem All of this shit being slaughtered, they poisoning the
[01:48:33.086 --> 01:48:34.817]   water Removing the father, ain't trusting these daughters
[01:48:34.817 --> 01:48:37.317]   Ignoring blue collar, keep printing the dollar And watching your sons and your daughters
[01:48:37.317 --> 01:48:40.317]   Ain't got any honor if I'm being honest I just ain't picking this side
[01:48:40.317 --> 01:48:42.817]   But I'm gonna ride for my freedom and die for my freedom And question the government lies
[01:48:42.817 --> 01:48:45.817]   A lot on my mind, it's so little time Gotta thank all of us leading the sign
[01:48:45.817 --> 01:48:48.817]   The devil he hides, an ego and pride They sell them, they sell them, they paying the price
[01:48:48.817 --> 01:48:51.817]   God won't give you more than you can handle Government should be dismantled
[01:48:51.817 --> 01:48:54.317]   Every politician gotta stand up Prepare for the war, we going to battle
[01:48:54.317 --> 01:48:59.817]   This is a war on religion This is a war on the children
[01:48:59.817 --> 01:49:05.817]   They give you the cure with the sickness This is a war on tradition
[01:49:05.817 --> 01:49:11.317]   This is a war on religion This is a war on the children
[01:49:11.317 --> 01:49:17.317]   They give you the cure with the sickness This is a war, this is a war
[01:49:17.317 --> 01:49:20.817]   I'd rather be red pill, get killed Than ignorant living in meat that's killed
[01:49:20.817 --> 01:49:23.817]   Don't stand up for something, you falling for nothing No way to the world that we know fall ill
[01:49:23.973 --> 01:49:26.174]  This is the revelation of a generation losing civilization.
[01:49:26.194 --> 01:49:29.054]  I'm determinated just to liberate us with our dedication for the terminator.
[01:49:29.074 --> 01:49:30.535]  Fuck your medication, de-administration.
[01:49:30.555 --> 01:49:31.975]  Can I alienate us or exterminate us?
[01:49:32.035 --> 01:49:33.476]  I'll just keep on praying for your salvation.
[01:49:33.496 --> 01:49:34.276]  You are outdated.
[01:49:34.296 --> 01:49:35.636]  Society becoming outrageous.
[01:49:35.656 --> 01:49:37.237]  Keep your house painted for the firstborn.
[01:49:37.257 --> 01:49:38.657]  The angel of death in its worst form.
[01:49:38.677 --> 01:49:39.377]  We being scorned.
[01:49:39.417 --> 01:49:40.118]  Look out for they horns.
[01:49:40.158 --> 01:49:41.518]  Remember this isn't a first war.
[01:49:41.538 --> 01:49:42.258]  They come unprepared.
[01:49:42.278 --> 01:49:42.998]  So just be aware.

[01:49:45.919 --> 01:49:46.640]  They feed off your fear.
[01:49:46.660 --> 01:49:47.480]  They wanting you scared.

[01:51:14.420 --> 01:51:24.420]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:51:15.589 --> 01:51:25.503]  Jimmy Levy on Twitter at Jimmy Levy Music and you heard about big record labels calling up saying, oh, you know, we want you to join us or tell people don't work with him and we're not going to sign you up.
[01:51:26.181 --> 01:51:27.382]  Who even wants these people?
[01:51:27.562 --> 01:51:32.166]  They want a monopoly, they want total control, and they're rolling out this total takeover of society.
[01:51:32.227 --> 01:51:40.374]  I was asking you during the break, Jimmy, because I'm really impressed, not just with your music, but you on air, and your story, and what's happening here, and the power of God working through you to save so many people.
[01:51:41.155 --> 01:51:43.917]  And again, your songs are all going to the very top of the charts.
[01:51:44.257 --> 01:51:45.639]  I said, what's coming next?
[01:51:46.199 --> 01:51:49.582]  And you told us something really exciting, because the folks need help in Australia.
[01:51:49.963 --> 01:51:51.184]  Tell us about Buried Alive.
[01:51:53.070 --> 01:51:59.214]  I have a new song called Buried Alive coming out, and it is um... Hold on.
[01:51:59.974 --> 01:52:00.254]  Hello?
[01:52:01.195 --> 01:52:03.316]  I understand people walking on me at my house all the time, brother.
[01:52:03.356 --> 01:52:03.876]  It's all real.
[01:52:04.177 --> 01:52:04.797]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:52:04.817 --> 01:52:08.359]  Yeah, I have a song called Buried Alive.
[01:52:08.839 --> 01:52:10.060]  I wrote it for Australia.
[01:52:10.480 --> 01:52:12.641]  It's coming out in two weeks.
[01:52:13.822 --> 01:52:18.285]  But basically, it's talking about how if we don't stand up, they're gonna put us in a camp.
[01:52:19.125 --> 01:52:20.226]  And, you know...
[01:52:21.022 --> 01:52:22.603]  It's basically very blunt.
[01:52:22.763 --> 01:52:36.230]  It offended a few people that, like, I played it for at the studio and, you know, at this point, like, there were many people they asked me not to use certain words that are blunt and, like, get right to the point.
[01:52:36.250 --> 01:52:37.551]  And I was like, why?
[01:52:38.031 --> 01:52:41.113]  They said, be more, like, quiet about what you're saying.
[01:52:41.133 --> 01:52:42.494]  And I was like, why?
[01:52:42.834 --> 01:52:48.237]  Like, right now, if I don't say something, like, I have this voice to say exactly what needs to be said.
[01:52:48.257 --> 01:52:49.638]  I don't want to put it in no subliminal.
[01:52:50.333 --> 01:52:51.414]  It's a very blunt song.
[01:52:51.474 --> 01:52:52.494]  It gets right to the point.
[01:52:53.075 --> 01:52:55.096]  And it's basically saying, we don't want to be buried alive.
[01:52:55.196 --> 01:52:56.197]  We are not ready to die.
[01:52:57.077 --> 01:53:05.922]  Well, I can't wait to see that, because that's a great way to describe what's happening with the lockdowns, with being told you're not essential, and then being injected with something that slowly kills you with blood clots.
[01:53:06.262 --> 01:53:11.465]  This is being buried alive, and this is sudden death syndrome in adults, and now they're coming after the children.
[01:53:11.485 --> 01:53:13.467]  And I heard some children in the background.
[01:53:13.487 --> 01:53:15.668]  That's what your song is all about, is it's a war on our children.
[01:53:16.952 --> 01:53:20.593]  Yeah, my little sister just got home from college.
[01:53:21.474 --> 01:53:24.415]  Well, man, I gotta tell you, it is exciting to see what you're doing.
[01:53:24.715 --> 01:53:26.795]  Jimmy Lee, we keep laying some truth on us here, brother.
[01:53:28.476 --> 01:53:28.976]  Yes, sir.
[01:53:28.996 --> 01:53:33.818]  I mean, where else do you think we should go with all this?
[01:53:35.498 --> 01:53:47.085]   Well, you know, the main thing is that we have to spiritually and mentally prepare because right now a lot of people made bad decisions, you know, And there's going to be a consequence for that.
[01:53:48.626 --> 01:53:49.988]  At the end, everything is written.
[01:53:50.048 --> 01:53:58.596]  We're going to see a persecution for those who are still alive here on Earth, but many people are not going to be here in the next three to five years.
[01:53:58.756 --> 01:54:04.182]  So, as long as we have peace with God right now, that is the most important thing, because we're going to all see this.
[01:54:04.622 --> 01:54:11.088]  We're not going to have people from our firefighters, from our police, from the people that run the cell phone companies.
[01:54:11.108 --> 01:54:13.871]  So we're not even going to have the technology to contact each other.
[01:54:13.891 --> 01:54:16.373]  We're going to have to build our own off-grid communities.
[01:54:16.694 --> 01:54:17.855]  We're going to have to start getting land.
[01:54:17.875 --> 01:54:19.937]  We're going to have to start farming again.
[01:54:20.217 --> 01:54:23.040]  And we're going to all have to live kind of like hippies in a way.
[01:54:24.798 --> 01:54:25.999]  That's what I see happening.
[01:54:26.040 --> 01:54:26.280]  Exactly.
[01:54:26.119 --> 01:54:29.399]   I'll just say it on that, you're right, the whole future is gonna be off the grid communities.
[01:54:29.399 --> 01:54:32.958]   In fact, the globalists say, phase one, they're gonna make us live in ghettos,
[01:54:32.958 --> 01:54:36.819]   those that don't accept the chips, those that don't accept the nanoparticles in our food.
[01:54:36.819 --> 01:54:38.760]  That's now being announced.
[01:54:38.760 --> 01:54:43.039]   Exactly, I mean, the Bible says we got beheaded for those things
[01:54:43.039 --> 01:54:48.039]  if we denied what was pushed on us.
[01:54:48.039 --> 01:54:52.559]   I know it's an interpretation, but everything right now that's happening
[01:54:52.559 --> 01:54:54.680]  is pretty much in revelations.
[01:54:54.680 --> 01:54:56.559]  That's right, and the Holy Spirit is guiding you.
[01:54:56.559 --> 01:54:59.238]   They took over the churches with this pre-tribulation rapture.
[01:54:59.238 --> 01:55:00.479]  That's not in the Bible.
[01:55:00.479 --> 01:55:04.599]   And yeah, it talks about the antichrist takes over and starts killing people, killing Christians.
[01:55:04.460 --> 01:55:09.170]   attacks on Christians have already tripled the last 10 years and now they're saying Christians are their main
[01:55:09.170 --> 01:55:10.798]  enemy and you're absolutely right.
[01:55:10.798 --> 01:55:17.340]   The rapture comes after the devil's defeated and bound by the archangel. A five-year-old can understand that,
[01:55:17.340 --> 01:55:20.539]   but the mainline churches are going to tell people that the Antichrist is Christ.
[01:55:20.539 --> 01:55:28.260]   Right. There's so many people, I believe, because it also says there's many Antichrists.
[01:55:28.824 --> 01:55:34.909]  So, you know, you see all of these people twisting scripture while speaking and telling people to get inoculated.
[01:55:34.969 --> 01:55:39.052]  They're trying to say, oh, do this and be a disciple like Kathy Hochul.
[01:55:39.093 --> 01:55:44.797]  You know, you have people like Kamala that's saying, love thy neighbor and do this.
[01:55:44.897 --> 01:55:46.258]  I think that's very demonic.
[01:55:46.378 --> 01:55:47.819]  That energy is so demonic.
[01:55:47.859 --> 01:55:49.707]   It's more than just I agree.
[01:55:49.807 --> 01:55:51.248]  It's an anti-Christ spirit.
[01:55:51.308 --> 01:55:51.508]  I agree.
[01:55:51.528 --> 01:55:52.389]  There's all the copies.
[01:55:52.409 --> 01:55:57.011]  It's like Agent Smith has many copies of himself from the Matrix, but there's that one spirit duplicated.
[01:55:57.031 --> 01:55:57.231]  Right.
[01:55:57.051 --> 01:55:59.211]  It's a very demonic energy channeling through that.
[01:55:59.211 --> 01:56:01.730]  So I believe that there's many antichrists on it.
[01:56:01.730 --> 01:56:03.251]  I agree, it's an antichrist spirit.
[01:56:03.251 --> 01:56:04.770]  I agree, there's all the copies.
[01:56:04.770 --> 01:56:09.671]   It's like Agent Smith has many copies of himself from the Matrix, but there's that one spirit duplicated.
[01:56:09.671 --> 01:56:11.451]  Right.
[01:56:11.451 --> 01:56:17.651]   And then, you know, yet what I had to deal with two days ago now on my way home
[01:56:17.651 --> 01:56:22.171]   from the Freedom Rally in New York, I was at JetBlue with my mother,
[01:56:22.171 --> 01:56:26.570]   and we both got kicked off of the flight because my mom was eating a candy bar.
[01:56:26.760 --> 01:56:29.001]  And they literally said, put your mask up.
[01:56:29.021 --> 01:56:29.862]  She said, I'm chewing.
[01:56:30.242 --> 01:56:31.283]  And the lady walked away.
[01:56:31.363 --> 01:56:33.164]  Five minutes later, the supervisor comes over.
[01:56:33.644 --> 01:56:40.733]  Asked me and her to get off the plane pulls us to the front of the plane And then they said we're gonna be removing you from the flight Do you want to stay or go with your mom?
[01:56:40.793 --> 01:56:41.494]  I said, excuse me.
[01:56:41.554 --> 01:56:42.495]  Why are you removing my mom?
[01:56:42.516 --> 01:56:47.041]  She was eating a candy bar So they ended up removing us off the flight.
[01:56:47.081 --> 01:56:47.942]  My mom got very mad.
[01:56:47.982 --> 01:57:01.927]   I filmed the whole thing And, you know, after that, like, they said, we're not, we're gonna send your bags to Florida without you guys, which is already illegal since 9-11, they had a protocol that they had to make sure the bags are with the people that it's going to.
[01:57:02.147 --> 01:57:03.448]  Sure, they'll just do whatever they want.
[01:57:03.468 --> 01:57:05.908]  And you were talking to my producer.
[01:57:06.408 --> 01:57:09.609]  You think, not words in your mouth, that they targeted you because she recognized you?
[01:57:11.490 --> 01:57:16.831]  It makes no sense over something so small, since someone else, everyone was eating on the plane.
[01:57:17.603 --> 01:57:29.228]  Okay, and our friend, our very good friend, stayed on the plane too, and they were so mad with the situation that happened, because I guess because I filmed them and caught them in their little power trip, that they said, eating time is over!
[01:57:29.808 --> 01:57:32.389]  They got on the mic and said that, and then cried.
[01:57:33.029 --> 01:57:35.651]  Like, it was like animals, like treating like animals.
[01:57:35.671 --> 01:57:37.111]  Jimmy Levy, you're awesome.
[01:57:37.131 --> 01:57:37.491]  Stay there.
[01:57:37.511 --> 01:57:40.933]  I want to come back and talk about the big demonstrations you saw in New York, and so much more.
[01:57:40.773 --> 01:57:41.453]  more. You're awesome.
[01:57:41.453 --> 01:58:00.252]  Don't you rain on my parade.
[01:58:00.252 --> 01:58:06.413]  Bring your demons. I'm not afraid.
[01:58:07.292 --> 01:58:12.252]   Push me right off the highest mountain. Hey, the bulls try to keep from
[01:58:12.252 --> 01:58:17.333]  drowning. I got a fever, but I gotta sweat it out.
[01:58:17.333 --> 01:58:20.532]  You won't dance on my grip.
[01:58:20.532 --> 01:58:23.492]  Better throw your shovel away.
[01:58:23.492 --> 01:58:29.333]  Whether you go or you stay, I'm gonna make it either way.
[01:58:30.322 --> 01:58:32.724]  Okay, I'm impressed.
[01:58:32.844 --> 01:58:35.607]  I hadn't heard this song, Red Horns.
[01:58:35.547 --> 01:58:40.547]  I got a fever, but I gotta sweat it out.
[01:58:40.547 --> 01:58:43.547]  This is life, take a beating.
[01:58:43.547 --> 01:58:47.547]  Okay, I'm impressed. I hadn't heard this song, "Red Horns."
[01:58:47.547 --> 01:58:51.547]  I'd heard the others and loved one like the other.
[01:58:51.547 --> 01:58:55.547]   This is gonna be, I'm gonna be listening to this when I'm driving home today.
[01:58:55.395 --> 01:58:55.755]  Wow!
[01:58:56.375 --> 01:58:57.536]  Because we're all experiencing this.
[01:58:57.556 --> 01:58:59.097]  We're all getting attacked by the beast system.
[01:58:59.137 --> 01:59:00.238]  It's all trying to destroy us.
[01:59:00.258 --> 01:59:01.258]  It's trying to make us die.
[01:59:01.278 --> 01:59:02.639]  It's trying to make us kill ourselves.
[01:59:02.659 --> 01:59:03.840]  It's trying to tell us we're not essential.
[01:59:04.120 --> 01:59:06.201]  Trying to lock us up in our house, bury us alive.
[01:59:06.521 --> 01:59:09.383]  Trying to impale us on their red horns.
[01:59:09.403 --> 01:59:11.024]  But we're taking the bull by the horns.
[01:59:11.324 --> 01:59:12.325]  The power of Jesus Christ.
[01:59:13.436 --> 01:59:15.877]  Jimmy Levy, Jimmy Levy Music on Twitter.
[01:59:15.997 --> 01:59:16.817]  Buddy, I'm impressed.
[01:59:17.057 --> 01:59:18.237]  I can't wait to hear the rest of that song.
[01:59:18.277 --> 01:59:19.177]  I was like, what is this?
[01:59:19.577 --> 01:59:20.377]  I'm loving the lyrics.
[01:59:20.437 --> 01:59:21.118]  I'm loving the sound.
[01:59:21.438 --> 01:59:23.038]  Congratulations, man, because I know.
[01:59:23.058 --> 01:59:31.860]  Now that I think about it, I hardly ever watch American Idol, but but but but I remember now when you were younger, I remember seeing you on there because my daughter would watch it.
[01:59:32.140 --> 01:59:32.780]  My oldest daughter.
[01:59:32.800 --> 01:59:37.561]  And so I remember you like, you know, when winning a bunch of awards, a bunch of stuff.
[01:59:37.961 --> 01:59:42.322]  Is it there a story about you getting censored or something on American Idol even years ago?
[01:59:42.482 --> 01:59:43.102]  Or am I wrong?
[01:59:45.092 --> 01:59:48.973]  Um, I didn't get censored, but like my episode was okay.
[01:59:48.993 --> 01:59:49.794]  It went through.
[01:59:49.814 --> 01:59:55.255]  Um, but I just, now if I look up my episode, I don't see it anymore.
[01:59:55.275 --> 01:59:56.196]  So.
[01:59:58.876 --> 02:00:00.797]  Cause I'm going from just a distant little memory.
[02:00:00.837 --> 02:00:02.878]  Was there some kind of controversy with you on the show?
[02:00:05.299 --> 02:00:08.820]  There was no controversy while I was on, on during my episode.
[02:00:08.840 --> 02:00:16.491]   Um, I think during my sister's episode, I had spoken out a lot because she was on the next year.
[02:00:16.872 --> 02:00:17.692]  She's also a singer.
[02:00:17.772 --> 02:00:19.174]  I trained her.
[02:00:19.634 --> 02:00:23.498]  I went on with her and, you know, I had already spoken out.
[02:00:23.518 --> 02:00:24.659]  I had woken up by then.
[02:00:24.939 --> 02:00:27.982]  And, you know, I wore a lot of my protest shirts.
[02:00:29.233 --> 02:00:37.455]  And, you know, I feel like that affected and possibly could have got my episode removed because it's the only one from my season that isn't there anymore.
[02:00:37.655 --> 02:00:39.836]  So this has been an ongoing process and a battle.
[02:00:39.916 --> 02:00:42.076]  I mean, we all fight different demons, as you said.
[02:00:42.096 --> 02:00:45.077]  Wow, just please continue, because I got a lot of questions for you.
[02:00:45.097 --> 02:00:47.478]  But what else would you like to impart out there to the audience?
[02:00:49.401 --> 02:00:55.305]  Um, I want to let everybody know that as an artist, it's very important right now to stand your ground.
[02:00:55.345 --> 02:01:01.289]  It's very important to, you know, give up all of the things that are worldly right now.
[02:01:01.710 --> 02:01:02.710]  It's not important.
[02:01:02.870 --> 02:01:04.311]  None of these things are important.
[02:01:04.712 --> 02:01:10.576]  Not the chains that they're showing to you, not the flashy jewelry, nothing, nothing, none of it.
[02:01:10.956 --> 02:01:14.939]  And at the end of the day, the only thing that's important is that you stand up for the rest of the people.
[02:01:15.239 --> 02:01:18.401]  You go into the streets, you go, you find where your local rallies are.
[02:01:18.881 --> 02:01:20.521]  Right now and you go and stand with them.
[02:01:20.541 --> 02:01:39.405]  I already went to like 15 states already in the last two months I've been preaching the gospel I've been trying to fight with everybody for their freedom and I've just been showing face to show that you know there's artists that do care about the people and There's a lot of 90% of the music industry is on our side.
[02:01:39.425 --> 02:01:40.245]  That's the truth.
[02:01:40.626 --> 02:01:51.249]   They're just being scared They're paid, you know, they're having their their lives threatened or they already joined a club which is I know I hear a lot of people say, oh, they can never get out.
[02:01:51.269 --> 02:01:52.090]  That's not true.
[02:01:52.150 --> 02:01:53.493]  God can save everybody.
[02:01:54.094 --> 02:01:54.394]  Okay.
[02:01:54.515 --> 02:02:06.171]   And what I'm trying to do is show them that, look, you can still be successful even with Speaking your truth, standing your ground, and, you know, doing what's right for humanity.
[02:02:06.551 --> 02:02:09.032]  You don't have to give in to the satanic agenda.
[02:02:09.372 --> 02:02:16.255]  You don't have to give in to the occult, because that is the biggest thing that is keeping most of them silent.
[02:02:16.515 --> 02:02:18.715]  They all belong to a certain religion.
[02:02:18.735 --> 02:02:22.017]  And, you know, it's not right anymore.
[02:02:22.057 --> 02:02:23.477]  That thing is shattering.
[02:02:23.837 --> 02:02:39.647]   What used to be popular, the good thing that I say that's giving me hope in the music industry is There's going to come a time that everyone's going to wake up with the shot, without the shot, pro-mass, without liberal, conservative, Republican, Democrat.
[02:02:39.687 --> 02:02:40.287]  It doesn't matter.
[02:02:40.408 --> 02:02:47.631]  Everyone's going to wake up to see that there was powers that pushed the spiritual and psychological warfare to divide us this whole time.
[02:02:47.911 --> 02:02:55.195]  And it all, no matter what you identified as, it was all a created characteristic by these same people within the matrix.
[02:02:55.295 --> 02:02:57.036]  And that's what people are going to end up seeing.
[02:02:57.496 --> 02:03:14.312]  And when they do see that, all of the old satanic music that these huge artists were pushing, and when I say satanic I don't literally mean they're saying the word Satan, but they're still doing something within his agenda, whether it's talking about any of the sins, lust, you know, or alcohol, any of the things.
[02:03:15.553 --> 02:03:16.314]  It's going to shatter.
[02:03:16.334 --> 02:03:36.185]  It's not going to work for them anymore, to the point where either they're going to have to stand up for what's right, so that they can, you know, we're going to be rolling our eyes because we're doing this now, but for them to even make money, or for them to even live, they're going to have to speak the truth, because the masses are awake, and they're only going to want to hear the truth.
[02:03:36.465 --> 02:03:41.008]  So, the good thing is, for the masses it will be good, because they're going to be forced to that point, right?
[02:03:41.588 --> 02:03:50.701]  Now, for us, who are doing this now, we're gonna be like, okay, we're gonna be seeing whether or not they're coming from a fake standpoint, whether they were forced because of what they were doing before.
[02:03:51.061 --> 02:03:52.063]  But at the end of the day...
[02:03:52.802 --> 02:03:56.104]  Everything is good for the masses and that's what's most important.
[02:03:56.464 --> 02:04:04.768]  If they're pushing because it's all a frequency, it's all a vibration, since the 60s there has not been a high vibration music.
[02:04:04.828 --> 02:04:08.350]  Back then it used to be because everything is a vibration, it controls the people.
[02:04:08.850 --> 02:04:11.932]  Now the voodoo and the music is very dark, it's very satanic.
[02:04:12.904 --> 02:04:17.629]  You know, I want to encourage all these artists that the time is over for this satanic BS.
[02:04:17.829 --> 02:04:19.071]  It's not going to work anymore.
[02:04:19.731 --> 02:04:22.314]  And all of the silence is not going to work.
[02:04:22.334 --> 02:04:25.057]  Your silence is complicit at this point in time.
[02:04:25.297 --> 02:04:26.358]  There's too many deaths.
[02:04:26.639 --> 02:04:28.240]  There's too many people's lives at stake.
[02:04:28.260 --> 02:04:30.843]  There's too many people who already lost their jobs.
[02:04:31.224 --> 02:04:52.562]   And You're at fault if you have a huge platform and you are a big voice Especially in the music industry where the children are listening to you and you have not done anything and most importantly God is watching everything and the scariest thing that you can ever hear in your life All earthly things aside is I don't know you and you do not want to hear that from God
[02:04:53.863 --> 02:04:55.885]  Well, again, I'm really impressed with your music.
[02:04:55.945 --> 02:04:58.387]  I'm even more impressed with you and what you're doing.
[02:04:58.407 --> 02:05:04.593]  And I want to invite you on the other shows to please join us again soon to chronicle your trips around the country and what you're seeing.
[02:05:04.613 --> 02:05:12.260]  But yes, your song, This Is War, I mean, I love both The Matrix and I like the music in This Is A War, but I love the imagery.
[02:05:12.680 --> 02:05:23.969]  When you're talking about the children and how they're under attack, that song may be even stronger than The Matrix or Red Horns because you're actually showing the people and it's very well produced as well.
[02:05:24.049 --> 02:05:25.690]  Are you gonna have new music videos coming out soon?
[02:05:27.102 --> 02:05:41.472]  Yes, I have a new song called Buried Alive and I'm going to be filming a really, really cool video that gets the message out in a specific way because I know that a lot of the platforms are censoring certain words and whatever.
[02:05:41.492 --> 02:05:49.297]  But I'm going to do it in a really cool way where I'm going to reverse the spiritual and psychological warfare that the elite are pushing.
[02:05:50.393 --> 02:06:08.757]   In order for your good, so by the way, I'm not a musician like you that's not one of my skills But I remember talking to top rock and roll people Multiple ones atop, you name it, hip-hop, you name it, saying that basically after the 70s, the order went out to create darkness, to create pain, to create discordia.
[02:06:09.158 --> 02:06:17.284]  And I've talked to some high-level Hollywood execs that said, oh, yeah, now it's make all the movies depressing to just bring people's energy down instead of that upbeatness and that empowerment.
[02:06:17.544 --> 02:06:19.506]  I mean, this is a real attempt to bring humanity down.
[02:06:19.546 --> 02:06:21.928]  And as a musician, you see right through that.
[02:06:23.240 --> 02:06:23.460]  Right.
[02:06:23.800 --> 02:06:29.462]  Me and you are 5 to 10 of our favorite movie characters, even right now, because we've picked up.
[02:06:29.983 --> 02:06:31.143]  We're all deprogramming.
[02:06:31.163 --> 02:06:32.764]  We're all on the good side of history.
[02:06:32.784 --> 02:06:40.747]   However, we're still programmed, whether we know it or not, by the 5 to 10 of the favorite characters that we grew up watching because They created the personalities at home.
[02:06:40.787 --> 02:06:42.108]  They wanted these divorces.
[02:06:42.428 --> 02:06:43.629]  They show the white family.
[02:06:43.649 --> 02:06:44.709]  They show the black family.
[02:06:44.729 --> 02:06:47.170]  They show the structure of what they want at home.
[02:06:47.411 --> 02:06:48.571]  They show the divorces.
[02:06:48.631 --> 02:06:49.512]  They show the breakups.
[02:06:49.812 --> 02:06:53.374]  And they're trying to manifest and create that in the households.
[02:06:53.674 --> 02:06:54.654]  They're showing the bullying.
[02:06:55.115 --> 02:06:57.536]  When did you see a kid get held up by a locker?
[02:06:57.976 --> 02:07:00.117]  They created the bully, the jock, the cheerleader.
[02:07:00.157 --> 02:07:04.038]  They created all of these personalities because they wanted the bullies in school.
[02:07:04.258 --> 02:07:05.638]  They wanted the school shooters.
[02:07:05.958 --> 02:07:10.240]  They did the crisis acting because they wanted copycat effects of those.
[02:07:10.560 --> 02:07:24.586]   And so it was all at the end of the day this psychological game in order to take away what God planned for man and woman and to Kill the family matriarch to begin with and also to ruin the lives at home by creating personalities for us.
[02:07:24.626 --> 02:07:26.927]  So nobody is actually living themselves.
[02:07:26.947 --> 02:07:28.808]  We're going to be deprogramming for so long.
[02:07:29.048 --> 02:07:32.570]  We're actually living the lives that the characters put out for us.
[02:07:33.792 --> 02:07:35.193]  You know what's great about this fight?
[02:07:35.273 --> 02:07:40.957]  It's sad to see people getting hurt by the Globals, but you're right, the awakening happening, hearing you, I mean, wow!
[02:07:41.317 --> 02:07:43.879]  I mean, you've got reality down, brother.
[02:07:44.419 --> 02:07:49.682]  Was it seeing the Truman Show that finally clicked you out of it, or what were other influences in getting you awake?
[02:07:49.702 --> 02:08:01.701]   I was at a lot of house parties, especially in Hollywood, and I saw a lot of Moloch statues, I saw a lot of Baptist statues, which you know, they're very open with
[02:08:01.701 --> 02:08:06.291]   that and I hold on do five more minutes with us And then we've got a special guest host
[02:08:06.291 --> 02:08:11.452]   Jade are taking over but I gotta hear this. Please stay with us. We'll be right back with Jimmy Levy. This is big
[02:08:11.452 --> 02:08:16.172]   All right, folks. We got to get Jimmy Levy back on the show soon at Jimmy Levy music on Twitter
[02:08:16.172 --> 02:08:20.532]   And of course, he's got some of his own sites and things You should visit because they're really starting to try to
[02:08:20.532 --> 02:08:27.772]   censor him He's gone number one on the Billboard charts, was successful before, but now he's gone supernova, finding Christ and suddenly breaking the matrix.
[02:08:28.372 --> 02:08:36.294]  But the five minutes we have left in this segment, my friend, you were saying the awakening was actually seeing the occultism for yourself in Hollywood.
[02:08:36.314 --> 02:08:37.075]  Tell us more about that.
[02:08:39.275 --> 02:08:43.941]   I started seeing a lot of, you know, Statues at house parties.
[02:08:44.261 --> 02:08:47.742]  There were a few house parties you had to prick your finger to get inside.
[02:08:48.683 --> 02:08:50.043]  And I didn't go in.
[02:08:50.183 --> 02:08:56.065]  But the ones that I did get a chance to go into were a few that were for like the Musical.ly app, for example.
[02:08:57.205 --> 02:09:00.886]  At the time, now it's called TikTok, but at the time it was called Musical.ly.
[02:09:00.906 --> 02:09:04.967]  A lot of the video social apps, they have a lot of adults there and old people.
[02:09:05.607 --> 02:09:08.309]  Um, some would be hosted in mansions in Hollywood on the hills.
[02:09:09.009 --> 02:09:13.232]  Um, and there was a few like people that would come downstairs and bring people upstairs.
[02:09:13.332 --> 02:09:15.373]  And one of them specifically was on Halloween.
[02:09:16.034 --> 02:09:23.579]  Um, I was watching this very beautiful girl go around and she was bringing one by one people upstairs and I was just staring at her like, what is she doing?
[02:09:23.619 --> 02:09:25.340]  Why is the security standing by the steps?
[02:09:26.240 --> 02:09:30.103]  And you know, she saw eventually that I was staring at her and she brought me upstairs.
[02:09:30.143 --> 02:09:30.943]  She, she came up to me.
[02:09:30.963 --> 02:09:32.064]  She said, do you want to ascend?
[02:09:33.052 --> 02:09:37.592]   like, yeah, I didn't know what that meant. So I went upstairs and I saw a whole bunch
[02:09:37.592 --> 02:09:44.411]   of women sitting on a couch and they were all in their bras and their underwear, I guess,
[02:09:44.411 --> 02:09:48.532]   and they're just sitting together. And like, I thought, oh, there's probably like a costume,
[02:09:48.532 --> 02:09:53.492]   whatever. Like, I didn't I didn't. I was like a wait to what was going on, but I didn't
[02:09:53.492 --> 02:09:57.292]   think of, you know, that I was in something that had to do with anything going on.
[02:09:57.885 --> 02:09:59.825]  Um, and I saw smoke coming from the door.
[02:09:59.865 --> 02:10:04.686]  So in my head, like, I was like, Oh, this is probably like a Halloween house, like a haunted house, whatever.
[02:10:04.726 --> 02:10:14.028]  And I opened the door and I see a whole bunch of old men standing in a circle and a really young kid ran out of the room and ran down the steps.
[02:10:14.268 --> 02:10:16.708]  And that was where I was like, okay.
[02:10:17.548 --> 02:10:20.309]  Brother, brother, brother, the same stuff happened to me.
[02:10:22.122 --> 02:10:22.723]  Repeatedly.
[02:10:23.303 --> 02:10:24.565]  I did not run down the steps.
[02:10:25.085 --> 02:10:28.069]  But yeah, it's definitely the real deal.
[02:10:28.129 --> 02:10:31.813]  They're inducting you into Satanism and Lucifer and it's always with sex.
[02:10:32.333 --> 02:10:32.654]  So yeah.
[02:10:34.608 --> 02:10:37.511]  So I went downstairs, I told my friends, let's go.
[02:10:38.051 --> 02:10:43.536]  And then the girl saw that I ran down the steps, because I guess she's like, oh, he doesn't want a part of this or whatever.
[02:10:44.176 --> 02:10:45.297]  And we left.
[02:10:45.657 --> 02:10:46.378]  And that was it.
[02:10:46.458 --> 02:10:47.719]  After that, I was like, OK.
[02:10:47.759 --> 02:10:48.280]  Absolutely.
[02:10:48.480 --> 02:10:50.181]  And just to be clear, it was just chicks at first.
[02:10:50.221 --> 02:10:53.084]  Then I did get out of it when I remember a bunch of old rich men were involved.
[02:10:53.104 --> 02:10:54.485]  So I don't know exactly what went on at that point.
[02:10:54.505 --> 02:10:56.346]  But yeah, this is what's going on, brother.
[02:10:56.407 --> 02:10:56.687]  Wow.
[02:10:57.007 --> 02:10:58.468]  And you know, the same thing happened to Mark Dice.
[02:10:58.508 --> 02:10:59.209]  He was on last week.
[02:10:59.569 --> 02:11:02.552]  He had a national show with a major rock band.
[02:11:03.353 --> 02:11:07.271]   that was going to be his co-host and at the end they brought him in at the major company
[02:11:07.271 --> 02:11:11.913]   that I've even done some work with and the CEO said we want you to pledge allegiance to Lucifer
[02:11:11.913 --> 02:11:19.271]   just like Bob Dylan said that he did on 60 Minutes. Of course Mark Dice said no. Mark Dice said no.
[02:11:19.271 --> 02:11:21.832]  Go ahead.
[02:11:22.048 --> 02:11:22.829]  It's very sad.
[02:11:22.889 --> 02:11:24.530]  It's very sad what's happening, bro.
[02:11:24.951 --> 02:11:31.517]  But at the end of the day, as long as we have God and we put God first, we got to be at peace and we have to help as many souls as we can right now.
[02:11:31.778 --> 02:11:34.000]  Because it's more, at the end of the day, it's the most important thing.
[02:11:34.040 --> 02:11:36.002]  It's more than the depopulation agenda.
[02:11:36.362 --> 02:11:36.923]  That's 100% at hand.
[02:11:36.963 --> 02:11:37.343]  We know that.
[02:11:38.724 --> 02:11:44.609]  But it's more important, their goal, to make sure people leave this earth without knowing God, without knowing Jesus.
[02:11:44.709 --> 02:11:45.469]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:11:45.589 --> 02:11:46.190]  Absolutely.
[02:11:46.350 --> 02:11:48.372]  And that's why they want to kill the people that buy their lies.
[02:11:48.412 --> 02:11:50.193]  Statistically, they're under their control.
[02:11:50.253 --> 02:11:52.675]  They're under their control, so now it's time to kill them.
[02:11:53.035 --> 02:11:53.796]  You're absolutely right.
[02:11:54.116 --> 02:11:55.057]  Very well said.
[02:11:55.077 --> 02:11:56.358]  I'm very impressed, Jimmy.
[02:11:56.778 --> 02:11:58.379]  And it makes me feel good to know that you're there.
[02:11:59.720 --> 02:12:03.443]  I know you want to talk off-air, so do I. I was telling you I wanted to talk off-air, you want to talk off-air.
[02:12:03.463 --> 02:12:09.366]  So this afternoon, let's get some time, let's talk, because I know there's some more stuff you want to tell me off-record, and I'll tell you stuff as well.
[02:12:09.787 --> 02:12:10.687]  We have 30 seconds left.
[02:12:10.727 --> 02:12:11.328]  Anything else, brother?
[02:12:13.989 --> 02:12:25.133]   If you're watching and you're one of those who are quiet on the sidelines, and you're still on our side, Go join everybody right now.
[02:12:25.153 --> 02:12:26.053]  Now is the time.
[02:12:26.073 --> 02:12:27.454]  I encourage you.
[02:12:27.474 --> 02:12:30.337]  There's people that are standing with you in the industry.
[02:12:30.357 --> 02:12:32.018]  They're about to come join us.
[02:12:32.338 --> 02:12:37.362]  There's a couple of silent artists that are about to come join us because I've had these long talks with them.
[02:12:37.663 --> 02:12:40.645]  I'm the artist that goes up to the biggest stars.
[02:12:41.626 --> 02:12:43.847]  You'll see soon who comes out and says their story.
[02:12:44.088 --> 02:12:46.395]   And I go, We have to make a song for God.
[02:12:46.655 --> 02:12:47.396]  Enough with this.
[02:12:47.636 --> 02:12:55.884]  And like, I go up to them, they're like, they never had someone say that to them or have like, you know, the balls to go up to them and just say that because it's so random, especially in the music industry.
[02:12:56.004 --> 02:12:57.305]  Jimmy Levy, we love you.
[02:12:57.345 --> 02:12:58.066]  Have a great weekend.
[02:12:58.086 --> 02:12:58.686]  We'll talk soon.
[02:12:58.726 --> 02:12:59.287]  God bless you.
[02:12:59.747 --> 02:13:02.610]  My eyes are blind, but I can see.
[02:13:02.430 --> 02:13:07.430]  The sun it no longer sets me free.
[02:13:07.430 --> 02:13:12.430]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:13:12.430 --> 02:13:21.789]   Yeah, the lyrics bring you down, but the music brings you up.
[02:13:21.800 --> 02:13:23.140]  But since the 70s, no more.
[02:13:23.160 --> 02:13:31.965]  I feel the snowflakes freezing me.
[02:13:34.466 --> 02:13:35.907]  The ninth circle of hell.
[02:13:37.287 --> 02:13:39.108]  Not hot, but freezing cold.
[02:13:41.189 --> 02:13:43.189]  Separation from God.
[02:13:43.189 --> 02:13:54.149]   Jay Dyer is a author, researcher, and really a smart guy. I always enjoy listening to him when he hosts
[02:13:54.149 --> 02:14:01.048]   once a week, and he's going to be hosting right now here on the InfoWars Global Transmission.
[02:14:01.632 --> 02:14:06.557]  I wanted to just take some time out here to talk about the fact that there's a lot of news I didn't get to today.
[02:14:07.979 --> 02:14:11.742]  I got to most of it, but I'm going to be hosting a special transmission 5 p.m.
[02:14:11.782 --> 02:14:12.163]  tomorrow.
[02:14:13.231 --> 02:14:19.456]  And sometimes it gets on a little late, you know, because it's not a program show on satellites and TV and everything else.
[02:14:20.677 --> 02:14:24.660]  You know, TV is programming you, but the term doesn't actually mean programming your brain.
[02:14:24.680 --> 02:14:30.205]  It means they program it on stations and satellites and then they have all the breaks and the ads.
[02:14:30.245 --> 02:14:35.409]  But I'm also going to be doing live shows very, very soon.
[02:14:35.429 --> 02:14:42.715]  We're kicking this off in December, where at least three nights a week, I'm going to host three hours live.
[02:14:44.235 --> 02:14:51.740]  Commercial-free and take your calls and special guests, but it's just going to be amazing.
[02:14:52.441 --> 02:14:55.203]  And you talk about commercial-free, long-form podcasts.
[02:14:55.983 --> 02:14:57.084]  I'm going to be doing it from my house.
[02:14:57.104 --> 02:14:57.784]  I'm going to be doing it from here.
[02:14:57.804 --> 02:14:59.205]  I'm going to be doing it from special locations.
[02:14:59.225 --> 02:15:00.566]  I'm going to be doing events.
[02:15:00.586 --> 02:15:01.787]  I'm going to be making more films.
[02:15:02.407 --> 02:15:07.731]  I mean, I am just on fire right now because the enemy's throwing their energy at us and God's going, oh yeah, try this.
[02:15:08.512 --> 02:15:10.953]  It's been, my energy level's just been off the charts.
[02:15:11.434 --> 02:15:14.754]   So, Thank you, God, for energizing me.
[02:15:14.955 --> 02:15:19.978]  And I just pray for continued direction and that I be in your will.
[02:15:19.998 --> 02:15:25.522]  And I really appreciate God helping sanctify me and keep me on the straight and narrow.
[02:15:25.542 --> 02:15:30.045]  So we're gonna have Jay Dyer take over here in just a moment.
[02:15:30.426 --> 02:15:34.709]  We need to be funded to launch all these programs and operations and things we're doing.
[02:15:35.538 --> 02:15:43.691]  And so those of you listening really are the ambassadors, you really are the missionaries, you really are the people that are going to carry this information out to the four corners of the earth.
[02:15:44.677 --> 02:15:48.199]  And especially in the future, the globalists may put me in prison or kill me.
[02:15:48.559 --> 02:15:49.360]  We don't want that.
[02:15:49.380 --> 02:15:50.040]  We don't want that to happen.
[02:15:50.060 --> 02:15:53.062]  Hopefully it's not going to happen, but it's in God's hands and in God's plan.
[02:15:53.082 --> 02:15:54.483]  The only reason I'm still alive is God.
[02:15:55.624 --> 02:16:07.911]  And so our work is becoming so effective and so influential across the spectrum, all glory goes to God, that the enemy is just really upset right now.
[02:16:07.931 --> 02:16:11.173]  They're trying to figure out, they think, the right way to not make me a martyr.
[02:16:12.173 --> 02:16:14.634]  And be able to still get their operation going.
[02:16:15.675 --> 02:16:22.757]  So this is a quite the time and I have to tell you again, you don't have any idea how influential you are just talking to one person.
[02:16:23.357 --> 02:16:26.759]  So much of the most important work I do is only talking to one or two people sometimes.
[02:16:27.299 --> 02:16:28.699]  So it's great to educate the masses.
[02:16:28.759 --> 02:16:30.800]  It's also great to talk to your friends, your neighbors, your family.
[02:16:31.700 --> 02:16:35.662]  Perfect strangers just let the Holy Spirit, the Holy Ghost guide you.
[02:16:36.883 --> 02:16:39.384]  Now, we got a lot of great products for sale right now.
[02:16:39.424 --> 02:16:40.445]  This is our biggest sale of the year.

[02:16:51.430 --> 02:16:55.953]  That's one of the big subjects I wanted to get in today, was all the supply chain breakdown news.

[02:18:23.850 --> 02:18:29.835]  He's also the author of two books, Esoteric Hollywood, one and two, and the co-creator of co-host television show, Hollywood Decoded.

[02:18:32.418 --> 02:18:35.360]  He's here with us now, jaysanalysis.com.
[02:18:35.420 --> 02:18:36.661]  Jay Dyer, thank you so much.
[02:18:37.001 --> 02:18:37.842]  Take over, my friend.
[02:18:39.603 --> 02:18:39.864]  All right.
[02:18:39.884 --> 02:18:40.504]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:18:40.544 --> 02:18:41.165]  Glad to be here.
[02:18:42.148 --> 02:18:50.454]  You know, I did a few talks last week on the breakaway civilization and I wanted to tie that into the notion of the beast system.
[02:18:50.514 --> 02:19:02.262]  What do we mean by the beast system and how might Hollywood and the movies that Hollywood's put out in the last, you know, several decades maybe, how would they be showing us things ahead of time?
[02:19:02.302 --> 02:19:04.263]  You know, we talked a lot about predictive programming.
[02:19:04.743 --> 02:19:14.941]   My books are about this idea of embedding messages, embedding Themes in fiction to really warm people up, prepare them for what the establishment wants to roll out.
[02:19:14.981 --> 02:19:16.183]  This is an old technique.
[02:19:16.203 --> 02:19:17.404]  It's an old tactic.
[02:19:17.844 --> 02:19:26.692]  We covered it in depth when we did the analysis of No Time to Die, the recent recent Bond film, which, as we said, was based on a lot of breakaway civilization ideas.
[02:19:27.133 --> 02:19:33.579]  So I want to go through some of the ideas of breakaway civilization in other presentations, fiction and nonfiction, white papers, etc.
[02:19:34.460 --> 02:19:46.928]  And I want to talk a little bit about the beast system and why that's really important right now, why that's the system that's coming into fruition now is another manifestation of this historic beast system.
[02:19:47.762 --> 02:19:53.464]  If you look at the Bible, for example, the Bible has this theme of the beasts representing world empires.
[02:19:53.924 --> 02:20:05.027]  And the world empires are always centered around the worship of man, man worship, self-worship, the deification of some emperor, and by extension something maybe deeper and satanic, right?
[02:20:05.067 --> 02:20:09.809]  A Luciferian plan to unite the world under a single Babel.
[02:20:10.566 --> 02:20:13.547]  The Tower of Babel is the preeminent example, right, in the Book of Genesis.
[02:20:13.947 --> 02:20:18.449]  Which, again, all these archetypal stories, amazingly, are already even in the Book of Genesis.
[02:20:19.129 --> 02:20:33.994]  The premise of Babel is, let's unite the whole world under one power, under one imperium of a pagan ruler, Nimrod, and let's give them all the same language and the same culture and the same ideology.
[02:20:34.995 --> 02:20:40.020]   And the system Didn't go away, even though the Tower of Babel, of course, fell.
[02:20:40.340 --> 02:20:46.764]  If you read, you know, Genesis, as it progresses into chapters 10 and 11, we know that the Tower of Babel goes away.
[02:20:46.804 --> 02:20:55.810]  But this same attempt at a fallen world, single structure, city of man, as Saint Augustine would later call it, continues to be re-implemented.
[02:20:56.388 --> 02:21:02.552]  So we get the Babylonians, and we get the Persians, and we get the Greeks, and then we get the Roman Empire, right?
[02:21:02.572 --> 02:21:18.982]  These systems, which many Old Testament books describe, including Daniel, including even Jeremiah at one point, these world systems eventually fall apart and give way to another instantiation of the same pattern of a beast system.
[02:21:19.463 --> 02:21:28.924]   Now, there's a fascinating what's called Deuterocanonical book that's called Maccabees and it's not in all the Protestant Bibles, of course, it's in the Orthodox and Catholic Bibles.
[02:21:29.504 --> 02:21:41.273]  And so whether you accept Maccabees or not, my point is just that there's an illustration in the various Maccabees books where we have at one point a ruler who wants to tag and track everybody.
[02:21:41.673 --> 02:21:47.638]  So he actually wants people to take this mark at one point before they can go and buy anything in the marketplace.
[02:21:48.556 --> 02:22:08.404]  And in my view, and I'm sure that a lot of people will debate this, but I think John in the apocalypse of the New Testament, Book of Revelation, I think the immediate context is Nero and is the beast of the first century Roman Empire that persecuted the saints and Nero is just this fanatical kind of super anti-Christ figure.
[02:22:08.845 --> 02:22:14.447]  I think Nero is a type of the end times final anti-Christ, whoever or whenever that will be.
[02:22:15.047 --> 02:22:18.890]  So, I'm not denying that there's a future predictive aspect to the Book of Revelation.
[02:22:18.910 --> 02:22:25.915]  I'm saying it's a both-and, where the Book of Revelation seems to be talking about something happening at John's day, as well as at the end times.
[02:22:25.995 --> 02:22:36.944]  And when we come back after this break, I'll get more into the details about what I think we're going to see as the beast system manifests, and how we're already seeing elements of it coming to fruition and manifesting now.
[02:22:38.072 --> 02:22:46.899]  Even though we may, I don't know if we're in the last times, there's certainly some things that suggest we might be, but it's just the same pattern of the system that represents itself.
[02:22:47.519 --> 02:22:48.560]  Don't go anywhere, stay there.
[02:22:48.580 --> 02:22:49.801]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:22:49.941 --> 02:22:51.182]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:22:51.202 --> 02:23:02.891]  I'm your guest host Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis and we were just discussing the history and patterns of the beast system as it manifested in the ancient world and up into the times of the New Testament writers and particularly the Apocalypse of John.
[02:23:03.801 --> 02:23:14.870]  And we noticed that there's a couple of colonalities that we see is that usually these direct the worship of man not towards God but towards some human created thing, right?
[02:23:14.910 --> 02:23:42.241]   We saw that with the ancient pagan empires in the book of Daniel where they worship this giant statue, right, that's supposed to represent Nebuchadnezzar, and then we see that as we get into the period when John's writing, the beast system manifests as the Roman Empire that demands that everybody worship Caesar, right, or worship Nero as an instantiation of God and God's power, and no different than what the Egyptians mandated, right, that you worship Pharaoh as the son of Ra and so forth.
[02:23:43.018 --> 02:24:16.965]   So, the point there is that there's an attempt in these systems to erect a one-world religion, a one-world governmental order, a one-world economic order that attempts as best they could with that, you know, ancient technology to track and to trace and to follow everybody with Some form of mark or some sort of identification that would be on your hand or your head or whatever and through various, you know, tally systems and taking a census of the population, those ancient imperial tyrants would try to control everything.
[02:24:18.659 --> 02:24:29.785]  And what I think the Book of Revelation is telling us about the future is that when we get further towards the end of the world, we're going to see the same system manifest in a way that we've never seen before.
[02:24:29.965 --> 02:24:42.772]  So as we get to the point where there will be the attempt to have a global total tracking and tracing system, we're starting to see what could at least be the instantiations of that type of system now.
[02:24:42.892 --> 02:24:45.413]   I don't know, again, I don't know.
[02:24:45.494 --> 02:24:47.335]  I'm just giving my analysis.
[02:24:47.495 --> 02:24:49.676]  If we're in the end times per se, we could be.
[02:24:49.896 --> 02:24:52.318]  There could be another thousand years left of the world.
[02:24:52.358 --> 02:24:52.718]  I don't know.
[02:24:53.378 --> 02:24:59.522]  But at least what we're seeing manifest now is undoubtedly another version of that beast system.
[02:25:00.443 --> 02:25:02.884]  And the way that we see that manifesting now is quite obvious, right?
[02:25:02.904 --> 02:25:07.707]  We see people moving towards a global government, just a re-instantiation of the Babel.
[02:25:08.718 --> 02:25:20.309]  The movement towards a one-world religion, where Pope Francis has recently, after his meeting last year with the Grand Imam, attempted to set up this Abrahamic Faith Center in Abu Dhabi.
[02:25:20.369 --> 02:25:32.061]  There will be one in New York, there will be one in Germany, and he's given his approval to this after that meeting with the Grand Imam of a new world religion concept that is kind of all the world religions in their basis, supposedly, right?
[02:25:32.441 --> 02:25:37.143]  So we're moving away from the specifics of Jesus or the Trinity or something like this.
[02:25:37.183 --> 02:25:52.711]  We're moving into the direction of a generic idea where you can just kind of copy and paste whatever you think God is into that equation and oh you see we're all worshiping the same God and we'll just make Pope Francis the Petrine head, the Pope of the world religions.
[02:25:53.091 --> 02:25:54.772]  That's where this is going, right?
[02:25:54.812 --> 02:26:03.469]   That's the movement that we're seeing And so Francis really, in my opinion, seems to be kind of a figure like the false prophet in the book of Revelation, right?
[02:26:03.669 --> 02:26:17.401]  The head of this world religion that's no longer specifics of Christianity or even the other religions, Islam, Judaism, but now this new manifestation of a, oh, we need to recover the ancient original world religion, right?
[02:26:17.521 --> 02:26:24.667]  Before we got into the fights of Judaism and Christianity and Islam, there's a common core that now we need to recover.
[02:26:25.541 --> 02:26:34.266]  And that recovery world religion will be the new religion that maybe Francis will be the head of or his successors or whatever happens down the road.
[02:26:35.847 --> 02:26:51.936]  And I think that, you know, now that we see the Vatican and Francis and other world religious leaders to signing on to the idea of the World Economic Forum, the ideas of inclusive capitalism, as it's called, which is just stakeholder capitalism that Klaus is promoting.
[02:26:52.517 --> 02:26:54.738]  We start to see that this is all one system.
[02:26:55.442 --> 02:26:57.945]  Another manifestation, again, of the beast system.
[02:26:57.985 --> 02:27:03.670]  Now I'm not saying that every Roman Catholic is a bad person or that they're bad intentioned or anything like that.
[02:27:03.710 --> 02:27:33.958]   I'm saying at the top of this system, It's the corrupt world religion leaders that are participating in this, and I would say the same thing for some of the corrupt leaders in the Orthodox world, some of the corrupt leaders in the Protestant world, as well as in Islam, and all the world religions really have a lot of corrupt heads and leaders, so I'm not attacking all the members of those religions per se, just pointing out that the way that co-opting and the steering and engineering of religions, what's sometimes called in the academic literature religious engineering,
[02:27:34.478 --> 02:27:44.486]  That usually occurs at the top level by compromising, co-opting, or installing already corrupted leaders in those high-level positions.
[02:27:44.506 --> 02:27:45.347]  And this is well known.
[02:27:45.427 --> 02:27:53.334]  I mean, everybody now knows about Jeffrey Epstein, everybody knows about these compromise operations that have gone on for a long time, the DC Madam, etc.
[02:27:54.014 --> 02:27:57.457]  Those are examples of how high-level powerful people are co-opted.
[02:27:58.323 --> 02:28:09.427]  You just heard in the last hour, right, the musician talking about how, you know, the parties that go on and how they kind of lead people into these wild parties to kind of get them co-opted.
[02:28:09.527 --> 02:28:11.068]  That's the standard model right there.
[02:28:11.948 --> 02:28:31.271]   So, the beast system then manifests as a total, not just cultural warfare, Which, you know, we saw last week when I covered the NATO cognitive warfare document, they said that psychocultural warfare is the main battleground of this system, and that's why pop culture is so important.
[02:28:32.973 --> 02:28:39.439]  Pop culture becomes an arm of the beast system that's almost like an evangelism tool, right?
[02:28:39.499 --> 02:28:41.842]  It's like both sides are doing evangelism.
[02:28:42.522 --> 02:28:52.353]   Satan has his evangelist and his His minions that sort of do their evangelism into the system, and then there's evangelists for the Christian Theist side as well.
[02:28:52.994 --> 02:29:07.300]  So both sides have evangelism, and the pop culture psychosphere is the main arm and tool according to the NATO Cognitive Warfare document, which shows that culture is the battleground.
[02:29:07.560 --> 02:29:09.701]  Toxic culture is the real battleground.
[02:29:10.572 --> 02:29:27.045]  And so if they can get you into following all these, you know, idiotic pop stars who believe in and promote the beast system, then you're more likely to default into accepting the tracking and the tracing and the constant, you know, stabbies and injections and the constant, you know, whatever the system's promoting.
[02:29:27.085 --> 02:29:34.812]  The garbage food, the, you know, the poison tab water, the, you know, the fake medical system, the fake virtual world is coming.
[02:29:34.852 --> 02:29:37.454]  By the way, they're just announcing now the metaverse.
[02:29:38.294 --> 02:29:48.056]  For how many years had Alex, for example, been talking about the fact that the Matrix was a plan, not just a movie, but actually a Pentagon plan way before it became a movie.
[02:29:48.556 --> 02:30:02.860]  The Pentagon plan was how can we put people into pods and they become human batteries that power the pod and basically the pod then becomes their world and they could just sit in there in their coon pod for the rest of their life as a battery for the system.
[02:30:03.903 --> 02:30:04.784]  And now we're getting that.
[02:30:04.864 --> 02:30:07.906]  Get in your pod, eat your bugs, and shut up, idiot.
[02:30:07.966 --> 02:30:08.887]  That's where we're going.
[02:30:09.928 --> 02:30:14.972]  Tiny living in a giant megacity high-rise coon pod is your future.
[02:30:15.572 --> 02:30:16.833]  And then you'll just be eliminated.
[02:30:18.314 --> 02:30:21.977]  By the way, look at the weirdness of this, right?
[02:30:22.037 --> 02:30:30.005]   It's like a bad B-movie set walking around with You know, these avatars and these PFPs.
[02:30:30.585 --> 02:30:33.526]  So, here we have the Matrix rolling out right now.
[02:30:33.566 --> 02:30:39.649]  The very thing that we were told would be dangerous even in the movies, right?
[02:30:39.809 --> 02:30:46.912]  The Matrix trilogy, one of these great examples of fiction, preparing us for what they would roll out 20 years later.
[02:30:46.972 --> 02:30:52.974]  And by the way, there's a new Matrix movie coming out, which I think will just be another version of, you know, telling us more about what's going on, right?
[02:30:53.792 --> 02:31:02.641]  So the revelation of the method that we've been talking about, this predictive programming element, is rolling out all around us in multiple ways.
[02:31:02.701 --> 02:31:15.674]  The beast system is a totality system, not just of economics and culture, but as we said, also changing the mind, changing the way man operates in terms of his brain chemistry even, as the document says, NATO document.
[02:31:16.650 --> 02:31:20.332]  And changing everything in the biosphere as well, as Klaus says.
[02:31:20.352 --> 02:31:21.332]  We'll get to that in just a moment.
[02:31:21.532 --> 02:31:22.773]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:31:22.873 --> 02:31:24.814]  I'm your host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[02:31:24.834 --> 02:31:35.058]  You know, I was just watching that clip of Zuckerberg there in his Metaverse room, and I was thinking, who did he get to do the graphics and the effects?
[02:31:35.118 --> 02:31:37.619]  It looks like a Tommy Wiseau film, like the room, right?
[02:31:37.659 --> 02:31:41.421]  So couldn't you see Tommy Wiseau walking into the Metaverse?
[02:31:41.521 --> 02:31:42.441]  Oh, hi, Mark!
[02:31:42.561 --> 02:31:42.761]  Right?
[02:31:43.181 --> 02:31:44.342]  Oh, hi, Mark Zuckerberg, right?
[02:31:45.343 --> 02:31:51.147]  Uh, so I thought we would have better effects, but wouldn't we be, you know, like in a real Matrix?
[02:31:51.187 --> 02:31:59.392]  Wouldn't it be like, I don't know, something realistic looking, not, uh, not a, not a, not Birdemic, right?
[02:31:59.412 --> 02:32:06.537]  I don't know if you've ever seen Birdemic, but that's a classic V. Maybe it looks pretty funny, but anyway, uh, I was talking about the beast system and the beast system.
[02:32:07.899 --> 02:32:11.201]  Really is a total system rewrite, right?
[02:32:11.261 --> 02:32:25.409]  It's a system where we not just are doing the cultural warfare, which as the NATO document says is the main element of the mind war, but it also talks about how we would go into the changing of biology in the very chemistry of the brain itself.
[02:32:26.249 --> 02:32:28.911]  And that is perfectly in line with what Klaus said, right?
[02:32:28.971 --> 02:32:32.313]  Many times Klaus has said, we ought to be in your body, we ought to change your biology, right?
[02:32:32.773 --> 02:32:43.619]  It's a change of you, yourself, the biology, the DNA, and that's what of course the experimental mRNA stabbies are, is a gene therapy experiment.
[02:32:43.739 --> 02:32:47.561]  It's an experiment on changing and altering humanity itself.
[02:32:47.681 --> 02:32:51.583]  And again, people think, oh, they wouldn't do that, they would never do that.
[02:32:51.663 --> 02:32:52.764]  They say they're doing that.
[02:32:52.804 --> 02:32:54.385]  What are you talking about, they would never do that?
[02:32:55.561 --> 02:33:11.133]  And again, it's not just that the beast system wants to get rid of and erase the image of humanity, because if man is made in the image of God, you can begin to see why the beast system wants to get rid of what it means to be man or woman, being made in the image of God.
[02:33:11.153 --> 02:33:12.635]  You've got to get rid of that.
[02:33:12.655 --> 02:33:13.595]  You've got to destroy that.
[02:33:14.296 --> 02:33:28.489]   You've got to destroy it in the minds of people as well, and that's what's so dangerous about the world that we're going into, is that It's a taking over of the whole mind, and the brain, and the body, and the biosphere.
[02:33:29.449 --> 02:33:37.931]  That's what this system is all about, and people find it hard to believe that it could be that wild of a mad science project and plan.
[02:33:38.312 --> 02:33:45.133]  Nobody would believe, nobody, that's Bond movies, Bond villains, that's science fiction bad guys, there's no way.
[02:33:45.373 --> 02:33:45.953]  Well, guess what?
[02:33:46.754 --> 02:33:47.994]  There's documents that talk about it.
[02:33:49.224 --> 02:33:52.566]  Not just white paper documents, public lectures, talks.
[02:33:53.907 --> 02:33:58.691]  I mean, it's like Klaus says this, and then the system says it doesn't exist.
[02:33:59.191 --> 02:33:59.932]  He doesn't say that.
[02:34:00.472 --> 02:34:01.933]  But by the way, he says it, and it's good.
[02:34:02.955 --> 02:34:03.675]  That's gaslighting.
[02:34:03.696 --> 02:34:09.459]  That's the very thing that's in Orwell's book, where doublethink is part of the system itself.
[02:34:09.659 --> 02:34:15.763]  You accepting doublethink, you accepting contradictions, gaslighting, in-your-face contradictions, is part of it.
[02:34:16.263 --> 02:34:18.725]  Bill Gates just said this week, oh, we're going to have no more meat.
[02:34:18.785 --> 02:34:19.905]  We can't eat meat anymore.
[02:34:20.666 --> 02:34:21.987]  Well, that's what Klaus said years ago.
[02:34:22.287 --> 02:34:25.749]  That's what the global elite books have said for the last hundred years.
[02:34:25.809 --> 02:34:35.764]   Bertrand Russell said a hundred years ago, in Scientific Outlook, In the future, the elite will eat meat and the masses will eat grains and synthetic meat.
[02:34:35.784 --> 02:34:39.585]  It's right smack dab in the middle of his book, Scientific Outlook.
[02:34:42.006 --> 02:34:50.849]  So we're talking about a totality system that a hundred years ago, the Royal Society of these elites said would be a totality system.
[02:34:51.389 --> 02:34:55.291]  The social credit system, the virtual system, the metaverse, right?
[02:34:55.411 --> 02:34:56.251]  Bertrand Russell, H.G.
[02:34:56.271 --> 02:34:58.992]  Wells, they talked about the social credit system a hundred years ago.
[02:34:59.969 --> 02:35:06.553]  Bertrand Russell said, you'll get allotted your credits from the system, the centralized economic computer.
[02:35:07.013 --> 02:35:12.377]  It'll spit out your credits and you have to spend them because they'll go away because you can't have savings.
[02:35:12.517 --> 02:35:15.298]  Because savings would allow you to have private property.
[02:35:15.779 --> 02:35:16.379]  Well, guess what?
[02:35:16.419 --> 02:35:19.361]  In the coming technocratic order, private property is outlawed.
[02:35:19.381 --> 02:35:20.442]  You're not going to have private property.
[02:35:20.922 --> 02:35:23.964]  You're going to be part of a gigantic Gollum web.
[02:35:24.665 --> 02:35:29.768]  And I'm not joking when I say it's a giant golem in the sense of a non-conscious brain.
[02:35:29.868 --> 02:35:31.809]  It's a giant hive brain, the Borg.
[02:35:33.310 --> 02:35:38.873]  In Jacques Attali's book, Brief History of the Future, he says that the, and he's one of the top technocrats, right?
[02:35:38.913 --> 02:35:40.054]  He's the Kissinger of France.
[02:35:40.594 --> 02:35:46.378]  He says that the new coming system, by the way, did you see his comment that was going around a couple of months ago on vaccines?
[02:35:48.209 --> 02:35:49.290]  And he says that in the interview.
[02:35:49.310 --> 02:35:50.030]  It's a real interview.
[02:35:50.090 --> 02:35:57.795]  He says in the interview, in the future, it's from like five, six years old interview, he says, we're going to roll out these vaccines for everybody.
[02:35:59.415 --> 02:36:03.418]  And if I recall, the long interview comment was actually about depopulation.
[02:36:05.059 --> 02:36:21.866]   Now, Jacques-Athelie says in his book, Brief History of the Future, he says the coming Gollum world brain will actually be a matrix style system where you will go into the matrix And you will be part of this mental, this computer matrix, virtual matrix, right?
[02:36:22.727 --> 02:36:26.552]  And you can't really opt out of it because the whole economy will be there.
[02:36:28.554 --> 02:36:34.241]  Now, there could be, you know, systems within that matrix that are, you know, rebel systems.
[02:36:34.261 --> 02:36:37.070]   You could have People using other currencies.
[02:36:37.090 --> 02:36:39.191]  There might be competing currencies in the metaverse.
[02:36:39.371 --> 02:36:41.272]  We don't know how this is going to play out per se.
[02:36:41.732 --> 02:36:45.854]  I still think things like Bitcoin can be a good hedge against this because it's decentralized.
[02:36:46.254 --> 02:36:52.236]  But you can bet your money that all of the elites are going to be pushing the cryptocurrencies within the metaverse that are centralized.
[02:36:52.757 --> 02:36:54.657]  And that way they'll be able to knock you off, right?
[02:36:54.777 --> 02:36:55.558]  And you can't use it.
[02:36:55.618 --> 02:37:02.761]  So the key will be the decentralized element for if things definitely do go into this metaverse world.
[02:37:03.467 --> 02:37:16.475]  So again, the metaverse was already here a long time ago in the Pentagon documents, a long time ago in Army War College documents talking about the future of warfare, the future of being hooked into this, you know, satellite uplink system.
[02:37:17.836 --> 02:37:23.139]  And now it's here being rolled out, and we were told through the fiction that it would be rolled out.
[02:37:23.763 --> 02:37:29.727]  And it's just interesting to me that, you know, that Satan has to refer to things in a copycat way, right?
[02:37:29.747 --> 02:37:36.551]  We know Satan always mimics God because he doesn't have creative capacity in faculties anymore since he's fallen.
[02:37:36.571 --> 02:37:39.352]  He's just sort of a copy and paste kind of guy, right?
[02:37:40.093 --> 02:37:46.177]  And so what the virtual system is, is a simulacra or a simulant.
[02:37:46.277 --> 02:37:46.737]  It's a fake.
[02:37:47.364 --> 02:37:47.524]  Right?
[02:37:47.925 --> 02:37:51.548]  And I don't think it's wrong necessarily for there to be a virtual thing, right?
[02:37:51.568 --> 02:37:56.692]  There's nothing wrong with playing a video game or doing this or that or representing things in virtual systems.
[02:37:57.212 --> 02:38:05.939]  But what Satan wants to do is get everybody into the virtual system to where they forget this real world and live their whole lives in this fake world.
[02:38:06.079 --> 02:38:10.343]  And that's really what we saw in the recent Spielberg movie, Ready Player One.
[02:38:10.523 --> 02:38:11.524]  Did you see Ready Player One?
[02:38:12.791 --> 02:38:19.758]  If you haven't, I recommend seeing it just for this point of deconstructing it as it's kind of a new version of the Matrix.
[02:38:20.799 --> 02:38:28.927]  Because in Ready Player One, we have what's called, and the tech elites, by the way, have been giving lectures on this for years, five, six years ago, what's called the gamification of society.
[02:38:29.828 --> 02:38:36.134]  Part of the new coming economy and the new coming world in this virtual realm will be everything being gamified.
[02:38:37.037 --> 02:38:39.499]  And again, the tech elite were saying this five, six years ago.
[02:38:39.700 --> 02:38:41.942]  So this is old information, actually.
[02:38:42.182 --> 02:38:45.185]  It's just now beginning to roll out with the Metaverse.
[02:38:45.225 --> 02:38:54.634]  Now, in Ready Player One, of course, the character has to solve this vast, complicated, you know, matrix world of the Metaverse that has all these hidden clues and keys.
[02:38:54.714 --> 02:39:00.079]  And when he solves it, he basically solves the designer, the coder guy's, you know, mystery.
[02:39:00.680 --> 02:39:13.925]   His personal Long story short is that the metaverse is just a way to interact with people in the internet sphere beyond the 2D screens that we have now.
[02:39:14.045 --> 02:39:18.847]  So it's like the new generation of how the internet will be.
[02:39:19.407 --> 02:39:29.952]   You'll still be able to have the 2D internet probably, but most people will prefer to go into the goggles of the The metaverse, so that they can switch in and out of these various worlds.
[02:39:30.632 --> 02:39:32.073]  And, you know, maybe one day you're playing poker.
[02:39:32.133 --> 02:39:35.576]  Oh, I want to go over into the Facebook cafe and hang out with my friends over there.
[02:39:35.596 --> 02:39:37.677]  Oh, I'm going to go over to the poker world over here.
[02:39:37.697 --> 02:39:40.880]  Oh, I'm going to go over here to Decentraland and play games over there, etc.
[02:39:41.220 --> 02:39:43.641]  So all of those different worlds will be accessible there.
[02:39:44.222 --> 02:39:51.687]  But the point is that a lot of science fiction has been warning us about giving ourselves over to this virtual world.
[02:39:52.027 --> 02:39:53.889]  It's immersing ourselves in this.
[02:39:54.517 --> 02:39:59.419]  I remember back in the 90s when I was in high school, I read Tad Williams' book, Otherworld.
[02:39:59.959 --> 02:40:03.560]  And Otherworld was actually a powerful prediction of this.
[02:40:03.720 --> 02:40:06.101]  The whole thing is about this, what's being rolled out now.
[02:40:07.162 --> 02:40:14.984]  Tad Williams had written a gigantic science fiction book called Otherworld, saying, yeah, there's going to be these virtual worlds where everybody's going to spend all their time.
[02:40:15.325 --> 02:40:16.265]  The metaverse, it's here.
[02:40:16.986 --> 02:40:17.266]  It's here.
[02:40:17.426 --> 02:40:31.131]  So, again, what better proof of the thesis of predictive programming and the thesis that they prepare us with this information through fiction than this, than the metaverse, than Ready Player One, than the Matrix.
[02:40:32.091 --> 02:40:42.915]  So we've talked about some of the themes that this beast system is going to attempt to have this total control, total tracking, total tracing, borg hive mind, one world religion, one world leader, etc.
[02:40:42.935 --> 02:40:56.392]   All of these things that are moving towards this centralization When we come back, I'm going to give you more examples of this from nonfiction and fiction, where we were told about this breakaway civilization that the elite will have.
[02:40:56.992 --> 02:40:58.493]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:40:58.513 --> 02:41:07.518]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis, and we were getting into the powerful elements of predictive programming in fiction, science fiction, Hollywood, movies.
[02:41:08.263 --> 02:41:08.723]  Etc.
[02:41:08.803 --> 02:41:09.604]  Even music, right?
[02:41:10.264 --> 02:41:15.888]  And in the first half of this hour, we were talking about the beast system and how it's manifested.
[02:41:15.908 --> 02:41:21.931]  And now I want to get into more of the examples of the breakaway civilization, because these two things go together, right?
[02:41:21.951 --> 02:41:28.335]  The beast system wants everybody opted into this thing that will be the self-destruction of those people.
[02:41:29.287 --> 02:41:35.957]  And then they will emerge on the other side of this, like a kind of Noah's Ark scenario, right?
[02:41:36.057 --> 02:41:41.564]  From their underground bases, from their, you know, redoubts to a new world.
[02:41:41.985 --> 02:41:44.669]  And again, it's a theme that we've seen in a lot of the fiction.
[02:41:46.232 --> 02:41:53.074]  And not even just in the fiction, this is actually an element of religious theology, ancient religion, comparative religion, and literature, too.
[02:41:53.114 --> 02:41:54.635]  The idea of a remnant, right?
[02:41:54.655 --> 02:41:57.576]  The Bible has this idea with Noah, right?
[02:41:57.656 --> 02:42:02.557]  Noah is the guy who's saved with his household, wherein the rest of the world perishes.
[02:42:02.597 --> 02:42:07.299]  So there's a biblical idea of a remnant that's saved, a chosen few.
[02:42:08.241 --> 02:42:22.555]  And then there's also, I guess you could say, a satanic version of this, where the elites say, oh, we're going to be the chosen few, and we're going to just sort of let everyone else sink into the mire, you know, be drowned in the coming flood.
[02:42:22.635 --> 02:42:29.201]  Not in a literal water flood nowadays, but in whatever is coming in terms of the possibility of some catastrophic event.
[02:42:29.241 --> 02:42:39.253]   Now, I don't know if there's a catastrophic event coming, but The notion of a catastrophic event or the idea of an end times is a powerful tool of psychological warfare.
[02:42:39.934 --> 02:42:46.282]  And we've seen this in multiple examples and studies of psychological warfare and psyops in the past.
[02:42:46.322 --> 02:43:08.534]   One of the most famous is the Orson Welles broadcasts of the War of the Worlds, and there's evidence that shows that that was actually a Rockefeller-funded study on mass psychosis and hysteria intentionally provoked through the broadcasting of an invasion from the Pleiades or whatever.
[02:43:08.554 --> 02:43:09.254]  The aliens are here.
[02:43:10.177 --> 02:43:14.963]  So everybody went crazy and it was all, of course, staged, but it wasn't just for kicks.
[02:43:15.063 --> 02:43:16.565]  It wasn't just to troll everybody.
[02:43:17.086 --> 02:43:19.829]  That was actually part of researching the psychological warfare.
[02:43:20.450 --> 02:43:26.757]  Now, there have been many types of things like this, but another example was in the late 70s.
[02:43:26.797 --> 02:43:29.501]  There was a famous documentary that the BBC put together.
[02:43:30.405 --> 02:43:35.488]  Which was a mockumentary, and I believe it was another one of these examples of psychological warfare.
[02:43:35.508 --> 02:43:36.729]  It's called Alternative 3.
[02:43:37.329 --> 02:43:45.274]  Now, nobody at the time had really seen a lot of mockumentaries, and so if you go watch Alternative 3 now, it's kind of cheesy and laughable, right?
[02:43:45.574 --> 02:43:49.636]  You watch this and you're thinking, these are so obviously actors, right?
[02:43:49.656 --> 02:43:51.698]  These aren't real scientists that are being interviewed.
[02:43:51.718 --> 02:43:55.200]  They're not real, you know, missing people, family members.
[02:43:55.280 --> 02:43:56.941]  It's very obviously acting.
[02:43:57.538 --> 02:44:00.619]  But at the time, people weren't as sophisticated.
[02:44:00.659 --> 02:44:03.699]  They hadn't seen a lot of mockumentaries and fake documentaries.
[02:44:04.360 --> 02:44:18.523]  And so if you watch Alternative 3, it's amazing as an example of propaganda, because the theory of Alternative 3 is that scientists are going missing as part of a secret project to study the coming cataclysm.
[02:44:19.663 --> 02:44:22.604]  So it's an imminent destruction of the world scenario.
[02:44:23.504 --> 02:44:37.034]  That is as the result, get this, of an ecological disaster that the world is already showing and climate change, well actually in this it's not global warming, it's at that time still global freezing.
[02:44:37.754 --> 02:44:50.864]  The fake documentary says global freezing is going to destroy the world, we're going to have another ice age, and that's because at that time Paul Ehrlich and his cronies were literally promoting in the scientific literature at that time in the late 70s the coming ice age.
[02:44:52.127 --> 02:44:52.748]  Oh, guess what?
[02:44:52.768 --> 02:44:53.688]  In the 80s it flips.
[02:44:54.488 --> 02:44:55.609]  It becomes global warming.
[02:44:56.549 --> 02:44:59.271]  Oh, and then in the 2000s that fails, so it flips, it becomes what?
[02:44:59.711 --> 02:45:00.191]  Climate change.
[02:45:00.211 --> 02:45:02.972]  They just keep changing it for PR reasons.
[02:45:03.933 --> 02:45:05.073]  It's just a PR program.
[02:45:05.713 --> 02:45:06.554]  It's a marketing pitch.
[02:45:07.374 --> 02:45:24.677]   But the point of Alternative 3 was to literally propose a breakaway civilization thesis of the scientific elite A bunch of elite scientists, they've gone missing to study and to, you know, prepare the world for the cataclysm of too many people.
[02:45:24.737 --> 02:45:30.779]  The documentary actually says it's overpopulation that is causing the destruction of the world.
[02:45:31.260 --> 02:45:38.083]  And so we've got to get it down to Georgia Guidestones, a very small number of people, the scientific elite, right?
[02:45:38.623 --> 02:45:40.864]  They will be the ones to go into the future, everyone else will die.
[02:45:40.884 --> 02:45:43.125]  Now, this was a fake documentary, obviously, right?
[02:45:44.532 --> 02:45:49.455]  And it's kind of in the vein of Orson Welles' other famous mockumentary.
[02:45:49.495 --> 02:45:53.598]  Orson Welles didn't do this, but if you've seen F for Fake, it's very important.
[02:45:53.738 --> 02:46:04.164]  Go watch F for Fake because Orson Welles is actually showing you in that documentary how fiction, media, is propaganda to trick you.
[02:46:04.244 --> 02:46:05.304]  It's like a magic trick.
[02:46:05.364 --> 02:46:06.185]  It's a sleight of hand.
[02:46:07.173 --> 02:46:17.903]  Because if the media talks about coming catastrophes, global warming, and that's going to kill everybody, most people believe it because of the default to accepting what some authority figure tells them, right?
[02:46:18.539 --> 02:46:20.300]  Well, he's on TV, it must be, right?
[02:46:20.320 --> 02:46:22.782]  You couldn't get on TV unless you told the truth, right?
[02:46:22.802 --> 02:46:25.303]  That's kind of the default assumption of most people.
[02:46:25.343 --> 02:46:31.007]  But now that narrative is beginning to break, especially in the last five years, people don't really trust the media anymore.
[02:46:31.507 --> 02:46:40.592]  But remember, these narratives of science and scientism, that too many people's collapsing the world, is a science fiction scenario.
[02:46:41.033 --> 02:46:46.116]  It has its roots in fake documentaries like Alternative 3.
[02:46:46.954 --> 02:46:56.614]  Alternative 3 is one of the first propaganda documentaries, mockumentaries, fake documentaries, to propose and promote the idea on a mass scale.
[02:46:58.214 --> 02:47:02.455]  That too many people are going to destroy the Earth and we're going to have a coming catastrophic event.
[02:47:02.515 --> 02:47:08.196]  And it also proposes the idea of a breakaway civilization, something like Asimov's Foundation series, right?
[02:47:08.216 --> 02:47:20.199]  If you read Asimov, you know that in that series, there's a secret society of scientists who are kind of a breakaway civilization who are going to save the, you know, the world, the galactic empire from the coming destruction, blah, blah, blah.
[02:47:20.339 --> 02:47:21.559]  It's the same story over and over.
[02:47:21.619 --> 02:47:24.120]  And what does most of the fiction nowadays say?
[02:47:25.173 --> 02:47:27.154]  Or at least a lot of the fiction.
[02:47:27.274 --> 02:47:29.135]  Well, think about Elysium, right?
[02:47:29.155 --> 02:47:37.259]  The Matt Damon movie where Matt Damon, you know, goes to some floating donut in space where the elite have, like, the cancer-saving technology.
[02:47:37.299 --> 02:47:44.642]  It's a breakaway civilization, and Matt Damon is the hero because he goes and gets, you know, the tech for the people, right?
[02:47:44.662 --> 02:47:45.423]  He's the man of the people.
[02:47:46.363 --> 02:47:47.964]  Think about movies like that.
[02:47:48.084 --> 02:47:58.821]   It was kind of derided critically, but the whole premise of Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is that there's an elite scientist Who's taking, who's creating an Ark of Noah, right?
[02:47:59.021 --> 02:48:03.947]  And he's going to destroy the world through a bio-warfare agent or something like that, or he's going to nuke the world, whatever.
[02:48:04.467 --> 02:48:09.633]  And then he'll repopulate the planet with a new Adam and a new Eve after this mass death.
[02:48:10.424 --> 02:48:15.847]  And there's a lot of weird references in that movie to the tech, to the AI being, right, the destruction.
[02:48:16.107 --> 02:48:17.088]  He's using AI, that's right.
[02:48:17.108 --> 02:48:22.190]  He's using AI robots to basically destroy all the humans and he'll repopulate the planet.
[02:48:22.691 --> 02:48:31.876]  I mean, again, I highly recommend watching Sky Captain, not because it's the best movie, but because the premise of the movie is the breakaway civilization.
[02:48:32.576 --> 02:48:37.599]  Project Noah, the very thing that we saw in Moonraker.
[02:48:38.539 --> 02:48:41.161]  Countless, you know, alien films have this premise, right?
[02:48:41.201 --> 02:48:47.725]  We have movies like where Deep Impact, where all the asteroids are coming, it's an ELE, Extinction Level Event, right?
[02:48:48.566 --> 02:48:56.751]  Oh, Resident Evil, we have, you know, the Umbrella Corporation has all their underground bases and they're going to, you know, we learn at the end of the series that it's actually a depopulation event.
[02:48:57.211 --> 02:49:08.843]  That the head of the Umbrella Corporation wants to depopulate the world, and then his genetically modified Mila Jovovich Alice clones are going to re-emerge as the new Adam and Eve or whatever scenario.
[02:49:09.663 --> 02:49:15.929]  We have this with 12 Monkeys, right, where it was an eco-disaster that destroys most of the Earth's population.
[02:49:17.194 --> 02:49:17.875]  2001 and 2010.
[02:49:18.775 --> 02:49:25.420]  If you watch 2010 or read the novel, it's not as good of a film, obviously, as Kubrick's film.
[02:49:25.941 --> 02:49:34.127]  But the purpose of 2010, Arthur C. Clarke basically has a breakaway civilization after the Earth has been depopulated.
[02:49:34.648 --> 02:49:41.793]  And the breakaway civilization is actually Bowman, who's joined himself to or uploaded his consciousness to the monolith.
[02:49:41.813 --> 02:49:45.616]  The monolith is like a big floating kind of like zip drive, right?
[02:49:46.474 --> 02:49:47.054]  If you watch 2010.
[02:49:47.474 --> 02:49:53.476]  Again, it's a boring movie, but go watch 2010 because it's exactly what we're talking about.
[02:49:53.516 --> 02:50:04.780]  The breakaway civilization where the elite have uploaded their consciousness to these floating zip drives in space, the monoliths, and then the monoliths create new worlds and new earthly civilizations.
[02:50:05.661 --> 02:50:08.081]  And they call themselves the Children of the Sun, right?
[02:50:08.122 --> 02:50:09.162]  The Sons of Lucifer.
[02:50:09.202 --> 02:50:12.283]  The Children of Light is what they're called at the end of the story.
[02:50:13.487 --> 02:50:14.148]  Childhood's End.
[02:50:14.628 --> 02:50:16.389]  Again, Arthur C. Clarke, same narrative.
[02:50:16.810 --> 02:50:18.431]  We got to take your children off world.
[02:50:18.751 --> 02:50:20.132]  We got to take your children.
[02:50:20.653 --> 02:50:22.494]  They're going on to the space ark, right?
[02:50:22.534 --> 02:50:26.197]  And then we're going to have to nuke the rest of the world over and over and over.
[02:50:26.237 --> 02:50:29.660]  This is the scenario that we see, especially in Arthur C. Clarke's works, right?
[02:50:29.700 --> 02:50:34.684]  Because he co-wrote 2001 with Kubrick for the movie.
[02:50:35.663 --> 02:50:37.083]  Movies like Snowpiercer, right?
[02:50:37.103 --> 02:50:38.204]  Movies like They Live.
[02:50:38.984 --> 02:50:41.484]  These are all breakaway civilization scenarios.
[02:50:41.504 --> 02:50:42.345]  And there's many, many more.
[02:50:42.385 --> 02:50:43.825]  There's movies like The Giver.
[02:50:44.605 --> 02:50:54.527]  Movies like Stephen King's The Stand, where we have a breakaway civilization that goes and hides in Colorado and emerges to create the new America, the new United States, or whatever.
[02:50:54.948 --> 02:50:56.848]  Many of the Bond films have this narrative.
[02:50:58.261 --> 02:50:59.723]  Many TV shows as well, right?
[02:50:59.743 --> 02:51:04.367]  So obviously I can't go into all of them, but if you want to get more into that, you can go to my website, you can subscribe to my work.
[02:51:04.488 --> 02:51:10.774]  Also remember to support the InfoWars by getting the products in the InfoWars store.
[02:51:11.134 --> 02:51:15.579]  Alex, support the team at InfoWars because this is the tip of the spear.
[02:51:15.619 --> 02:51:17.360]  This is what's waking up so many people.
[02:51:17.380 --> 02:51:20.764]  This is a crucial time as so many people are seeing the craziness.
[02:51:21.440 --> 02:51:27.624]  To wake them up, and Alex and crew can only stay on air if you support them by going to the store right now.
[02:51:31.826 --> 02:51:36.149]  You're watching the American Journal with Harrison Smith.
[02:51:36.569 --> 02:51:38.270]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:51:38.590 --> 02:51:42.092]  This is The War Room with Owen Schroeder.
[02:51:42.312 --> 02:51:46.415]  InfraWars, the most banned network in the world.
[02:51:47.315 --> 02:51:57.123]   On December 23rd, 2021, We are coming up on the 108th anniversary of the Federal Reserve.
[02:51:58.084 --> 02:52:02.827]  And it's as federal as Federal Express, or Federal Ammunition, or Federal Cleaners.
[02:52:03.407 --> 02:52:04.228]  It's not federal.
[02:52:04.308 --> 02:52:07.850]  It's owned by a consortium of private banking families.
[02:52:08.570 --> 02:52:19.277]   The last numbers we got, about 100 years ago, is that 80 plus percent of the stock is owned by a handful of European families Including the British Royal Family.
[02:52:19.538 --> 02:52:24.462]  So in 1913, we see the beginning of the foreign corporate takeover of America.
[02:52:24.602 --> 02:52:40.116]  And if you fast forward now 108 years, come up about a month and a half to the 108th anniversary, we have the private central banks of the world through the Davos Group and the UN that the Rockefellers set up announcing that they are going to get rid of the dollar and all the major world currencies.
[02:52:40.256 --> 02:52:45.578]  Before they do it, they're going to devalue it down to nothing to impoverish and enslave the people.
[02:52:45.638 --> 02:52:55.020]  But they have the first use of the money to buy up real companies, to buy up real patents, farmland, infrastructure, you name it, to have total, absolute control.
[02:52:55.180 --> 02:53:03.423]  That's why we're seeing such massive supply chain breakdowns around the world, because they admit they're also deliberately cutting that off to bankrupt small businesses.
[02:53:03.723 --> 02:53:17.532]   They're now admitting that they're going to add a carbon tax to the vaccine passport apps The UN has now declared as the world system that the new world currency will be based on carbon taxes that even control where you can go and what you can do.
[02:53:17.732 --> 02:53:18.632]  This is all official.
[02:53:19.013 --> 02:53:19.853]  This isn't coming.
[02:53:19.893 --> 02:53:21.234]  It's on the drawing boards anymore.
[02:53:21.695 --> 02:53:25.298]  It was announced just last week in mid-October 2021.
[02:53:27.159 --> 02:53:31.784]   Ladies and gentlemen, That's why they're censoring everybody off the internet that knows the truth.
[02:53:31.844 --> 02:53:37.027]  That's why they're trying to silence even Senator Paul when he gets up and gives important speeches in the Senate.
[02:53:37.528 --> 02:53:40.690]  It's because this is the final takeover of America.
[02:53:40.970 --> 02:53:48.055]  Not just our banking, not just our dollar, but of our very lives with a tracker system that's on these surveillance platform phones.
[02:53:48.695 --> 02:53:51.699]  To track and trace and control everything we do.
[02:53:52.320 --> 02:53:55.805]  That's why it's more important than ever for InfoWars to stay on the air.
[02:53:56.085 --> 02:53:59.130]  And for you to spread the word about InfoWars, because we were born for this time.
[02:53:59.530 --> 02:54:00.552]  You were born for this time.
[02:54:00.972 --> 02:54:04.397]  Yes, things are scary, but we've never seen such a great awakening.
[02:54:04.536 --> 02:54:08.896]   at this level. It is massive. So the minds out there are fertile
[02:54:08.896 --> 02:54:15.776]   and they're ready for the truth. So please share the videos and the articles at InfoWars.com and Band.Video
[02:54:15.776 --> 02:54:19.856]   and please financially support InfoWars by getting great products that you and
[02:54:19.856 --> 02:54:24.016]   your family already need. Like BODY's Ultimate Turmeric Formula
[02:54:24.042 --> 02:54:25.543]  95% Curcuminoid.
[02:54:25.563 --> 02:54:26.844]  One of our most popular products.
[02:54:26.904 --> 02:54:27.824]  So good for your joints.
[02:54:27.984 --> 02:54:29.005]  So good for your immune system.
[02:54:29.025 --> 02:54:30.005]  So good for inflammation.
[02:54:30.185 --> 02:54:30.886]  Antioxidant.
[02:54:30.986 --> 02:54:32.827]  The strongest formula we know of out there.
[02:54:32.847 --> 02:54:33.767]  There may be one stronger.
[02:54:33.827 --> 02:54:34.428]  We don't know about it.
[02:54:34.528 --> 02:54:36.028]  This is over-the-top strong.
[02:54:36.649 --> 02:54:37.309]  95% Curcuminoid.
[02:54:37.509 --> 02:54:38.870]  And notice, it's got a white top.
[02:54:39.110 --> 02:54:40.971]  We haven't been able to get black tops for over a year.
[02:54:41.031 --> 02:54:42.732]  This is the second run now with a white top.
[02:54:42.772 --> 02:54:45.533]  Just an example of the major supply chain breakdowns.
[02:54:45.854 --> 02:54:48.395]  But people can survive with white tops instead of black tops.
[02:54:48.735 --> 02:54:55.920]  People aren't going to be as healthy without access to things like this turmeric that is so essential that God literally gave us through Mother Nature.
[02:54:56.080 --> 02:55:04.245]  So, get your turmeric back in stock if you're being sold out for 4 or 5 months because of supply chain problems at 40% off at infomorestore.com.

[02:55:06.506 --> 02:55:10.707]   and we're going to be able to run it for at least a week, but then it's going to go back to full price
[02:55:10.707 --> 02:55:12.787]  because we need those funds to fund our operation.
[02:55:12.787 --> 02:55:17.386]   But for folks that step to the plate and order early, you know who you are, we're giving you the big discount

[02:55:29.266 --> 02:55:32.426]  (electronic music)
[02:55:32.426 --> 02:55:38.025]   If you're listening to this message in the weekend of Friday, October 22nd, 2021,
[02:55:38.025 --> 02:55:43.787]   this is your last chance to get some of our best selling, amazing products at infowarestore.com
[02:55:43.787 --> 02:55:44.666]  before they sell out.

[02:55:51.865 --> 02:55:53.666]  and the very engines of your cells.
[02:55:53.629 --> 02:55:58.369]   I mean, it's got a big dose of the highest quality PQQ and CoQ10 and a bunch of other
[02:55:58.369 --> 02:56:01.388]   key ingredients that God gave us through nature that are simply amazing.
[02:56:01.388 --> 02:56:02.388]  It's 40% off.
[02:56:02.388 --> 02:56:06.589]   This product's been sold out for six, seven months because of supply chain breakdowns
[02:56:06.589 --> 02:56:09.269]  and because we would not cut the quality of the ingredients.
[02:56:09.269 --> 02:56:12.589]   We could cut the quality all day and buy crap from China and never be sold out, but we're
[02:56:12.589 --> 02:56:13.589]  not doing that.
[02:56:13.589 --> 02:56:15.308]  This is the highest rated.

[02:56:21.589 --> 02:56:23.029]  Force Ultra as well.
[02:56:23.029 --> 02:56:24.029]  It will be sold out on Monday.
[02:56:24.029 --> 02:56:25.029]  It's 25% off.
[02:56:25.029 --> 02:56:28.429]   So support the Infor by getting great products at the same time.
[02:56:28.429 --> 02:56:30.429]  Thank you all for your support.
[02:56:30.429 --> 02:56:31.708]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:56:31.708 --> 02:56:33.229]  That's why Infowars has to be on air.
[02:56:33.214 --> 02:56:33.734]  Because you know what?
[02:56:33.754 --> 02:56:35.896]  We do scream it from the top of the mountain.
[02:56:35.916 --> 02:56:41.599]  We do try to get as many eyes and as many ears on this information as possible.
[02:56:41.999 --> 02:56:44.941]  And it's only InfoWars that does it, quite frankly.
[02:56:45.181 --> 02:56:47.502]  That's why InfoWarsStore.com is so important.
[02:56:47.622 --> 02:56:54.607]   But aside from the importance and the necessity of InfoWars, or InfoWars Store, It's a great store.
[02:56:54.647 --> 02:56:57.571]  We have the best supplements on the market.
[02:56:57.691 --> 02:56:58.872]  They're badass supplements.
[02:56:58.892 --> 02:57:00.454]  They are badass supplements.
[02:57:00.494 --> 02:57:10.306]  In fact, I don't even know if I want to go with this, but soon people are going to realize, in the healthcare, nutrition, supplement industry, that it may be kind of soft at InfoWare supplements.
[02:57:11.107 --> 02:57:14.029]  Soon they're going to realize that we have the best supplements on the market.
[02:57:14.349 --> 02:57:17.611]  It might be before long people are dialing up to private label this stuff.
[02:57:17.712 --> 02:57:18.652]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[02:57:19.012 --> 02:57:20.013]  DNA Force Plus.
[02:57:20.073 --> 02:57:21.954]  This is such an elite supplement.
[02:57:22.295 --> 02:57:23.876]  This is the elite of the elite.
[02:57:24.216 --> 02:57:28.379]  And people go to it and they see the high price and they're like, whoa, this is expensive.
[02:57:28.439 --> 02:57:30.580]  Yeah, it's the real deal, man.
[02:57:31.381 --> 02:57:35.403]  Look at all the ingredients in DNA Force Plus and do the research and you'll know why.
[02:57:35.423 --> 02:57:36.444]  Folks, 100% recommendation rate.
[02:57:39.746 --> 02:57:41.627]  100%.
[02:57:40.567 --> 02:57:41.627]  All 5-star reviews.
[02:57:41.907 --> 02:57:43.928]  Not a single 4-star review.
[02:57:44.028 --> 02:57:44.809]  Not one.
[02:57:45.269 --> 02:57:45.889]  All five.
[02:57:46.289 --> 02:57:48.670]  That is almost impossible in certified reviews.
[02:57:49.151 --> 02:57:50.491]  I guess we've just made it possible.
[02:57:50.551 --> 02:57:51.472]  DNA Force Plus.
[02:57:51.732 --> 02:57:53.093]  It's possible to get a perfect rating.
[02:57:53.913 --> 02:57:55.974]  That's just one of the incredible supplements.
[02:57:56.374 --> 02:57:57.334]  BrainForce Ultra.
[02:57:57.374 --> 02:58:06.198]  We brought this to try what a liquid tincture would be like in comparison to the formula that we had in pill form, BrainForce Plus.
[02:58:06.258 --> 02:58:07.979]  We said, hey, let's try a liquid tincture.
[02:58:08.559 --> 02:58:10.680]  Liquid tinctures sometimes are a little bit more effective.
[02:58:11.320 --> 02:58:13.281]  And so let's go ahead and just try that.
[02:58:13.881 --> 02:58:14.741]  Limited release.
[02:58:15.322 --> 02:58:18.183]  It sold off the shelves within a month.
[02:58:18.923 --> 02:58:21.247]  And so we just, it was like an experiment.
[02:58:21.668 --> 02:58:22.629]  Like, oh, that worked.
[02:58:22.749 --> 02:58:24.352]  Let's go ahead and do that again.
[02:58:24.933 --> 02:58:28.198]  So we've purchased another shipment and it is back in stock.
[02:58:28.799 --> 02:58:30.201]  Brain Force Ultra.
[02:58:31.411 --> 02:58:35.113]  And I've been one to take BrainForce Plus before I go on air.
[02:58:35.213 --> 02:58:40.397]  I've now switched to BrainForce Ultra, exclusively available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:58:40.537 --> 02:58:44.679]  Right there's my bottle that I keep on my desk so I can have it every day.
[02:58:44.699 --> 02:58:46.601]  It's at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:58:46.641 --> 02:58:48.882]  Great supplements and fund the InfoWars.
