[00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:04.070]  Big tech isn't just censoring, they're murdering people.
[00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:17.272]  They're murdering your ability to get medical care, they're murdering your ability to get the truth, they're murdering your ability to get treatments that are basically 100% effective, and they are murdering our republic, and they are criminals, they are terrorists.
[00:00:17.772 --> 00:00:19.453]  They are terrorists!
[00:00:20.873 --> 00:00:26.314]  They are now banning mainline news sites that point out vaccine injection
[00:00:27.492 --> 00:00:29.974]  Experimental injection of children without parochial consent is illegal?
[00:00:30.375 --> 00:00:31.696]  YouTube is now banning that.
[00:00:32.136 --> 00:00:34.678]  I mean, they are raping us!
[00:00:34.758 --> 00:00:40.243]  They are suppressing us while this depopulation sterilization operation is carried out.
[00:00:40.303 --> 00:00:41.104]  They are terrorists.
[00:00:41.965 --> 00:00:46.909]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:57.622]  And I've heard you speak about it because you're always, I'm not being solicitous, but you're always straight up about what you're doing.
[00:00:58.062 --> 00:01:12.626]  And the question is whether or not we should be in a position where you are, why can't the experts say, we know that this virus is in fact,
[00:01:14.026 --> 00:01:21.612]  Uh, it's going to be, or excuse me, we know why all the drugs approved are not temporarily approved, but permanently approved.
[00:01:22.172 --> 00:01:23.073]  That's underway too.
[00:01:23.093 --> 00:01:24.534]  I expect that to occur quickly.
[00:01:24.574 --> 00:01:26.275]  Well, that means, you mean for the FDA?
[00:01:26.455 --> 00:01:27.096]  For the FDA.
[00:01:27.216 --> 00:01:38.324]  Some of the stuff, I mean, QAnon, the idea that the Democrats or the Biden is hiding people and sucking the blood of children.
[00:01:38.424 --> 00:01:39.645]  No, I'm serious.
[00:01:42.537 --> 00:01:46.379]  Now, you may not like me, and that's your right.
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.261]  Look, it's a simple thing.
[00:01:49.341 --> 00:01:52.222]  You can walk out and say, I just don't like the way that guy wears his tie.
[00:01:52.242 --> 00:01:52.963]  I'm voting against him.
[00:01:52.983 --> 00:01:53.943]  You have a right to do that.
[00:01:54.383 --> 00:02:04.089]  I think you're beginning to see some of the, and by Democrats as well, sort of the venom sort of leak out of a lot of it.
[00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:07.691]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:02:09.764 --> 00:02:13.125]  On this live Thursday, July 22nd broadcast.
[00:02:15.026 --> 00:02:20.548]  You can't really overstate the fiasco of the train wreck that was last night.
[00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:23.249]  I did not watch it live.
[00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:30.692]  I went out and had a business meeting late dinner with some of the crew with Owen Schroer and Rob Dew and again some of the crew.
[00:02:30.712 --> 00:02:35.013]  And then I got home and it was just all over the place what a disaster it was.
[00:02:35.053 --> 00:02:37.995]  So I watched the whole thing and it was
[00:02:39.881 --> 00:02:41.522]  An hour and a half, I'll never get back in my life.
[00:02:41.602 --> 00:02:42.842]  It was absolutely horrible.
[00:02:43.282 --> 00:02:47.104]  And I didn't feel good like, oh, here's my enemy, here's the puppet, he can't talk.
[00:02:48.385 --> 00:02:49.565]  He has complete dementia.
[00:02:50.145 --> 00:02:55.708]  My grandmother at 92 was purposely not eating anymore because she wanted to die.
[00:02:55.788 --> 00:02:57.088]  She weighed about 90 pounds.
[00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:00.530]  And she was way more coherent the day she died.
[00:03:01.894 --> 00:03:03.955]  Of self-imposed basically starvation.
[00:03:04.695 --> 00:03:05.315]  I'm not blaming her.
[00:03:05.335 --> 00:03:07.076]  That's the Christian way to go if you want to go.
[00:03:07.696 --> 00:03:09.557]  Refused morphine, refused it all, just didn't eat.
[00:03:10.517 --> 00:03:11.657]  Refused cancer surgery.
[00:03:11.677 --> 00:03:12.558]  Cancer was eating her up.
[00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:16.779]  They'd already done cancer surgery years before, so she said she wasn't going to do it anymore.
[00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.380]  But I'm digressing.
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:28.283]  My 92-year-old grandmother, eaten alive by cancer, starving herself to death, as she was dying, was more coherent than he is on stage.
[00:03:29.787 --> 00:03:30.567]  She was going in and out.
[00:03:30.767 --> 00:03:31.968]  I wasn't there, but family was.
[00:03:32.828 --> 00:03:34.389]  Like, oh, I see my husband.
[00:03:34.429 --> 00:03:34.789]  I see you.
[00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:35.630]  I see the angels.
[00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.170]  Oh, my mother, my father.
[00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.171]  I see you.
[00:03:38.191 --> 00:03:38.471]  I love you.
[00:03:38.511 --> 00:03:39.251]  I'm gonna be there soon.
[00:03:40.251 --> 00:03:41.892]  She was coherent while she was dying.
[00:03:43.393 --> 00:03:47.034]  They have this person up there, less coherent than my grandmother when she died.
[00:03:47.775 --> 00:03:48.975]  Or my grandfather when he died.
[00:03:49.015 --> 00:03:50.976]  My dad's dad was very coherent when he was dying.
[00:03:52.517 --> 00:03:57.199]  People dying are more coherent than
[00:03:58.831 --> 00:04:00.993]  This individual and that's because he's a tombstone.
[00:04:01.093 --> 00:04:05.296]  He's a sign that they've dominated us and they're going to rub this into our faces.
[00:04:05.796 --> 00:04:07.718]  I have articles here all over the country.
[00:04:07.758 --> 00:04:22.229]  They're putting men in prisons and letting them rape women in women's prisons and then tell them the women just have an abortion or make them wear condoms because, you know, a woman's allowed to rape.
[00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:24.631]  But women have penises.
[00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:27.954]  And we have a reanimated corpse
[00:04:30.638 --> 00:04:31.718]  Up there on TV.
[00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:36.660]  That is just a sign of how pathetic we are.
[00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.860]  And I'm being honest.
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.722]  We're not going to climb out of this until we admit what a joke we are.
[00:04:42.722 --> 00:04:43.662]  This is disgusting.
[00:04:43.682 --> 00:04:44.483]  This is untenable.
[00:04:44.983 --> 00:04:47.004]  We're being gas lit to death and it needs to stop.
[00:04:47.864 --> 00:04:52.665]  I mean, the entire town hall was the biggest train wreck I've ever seen.
[00:04:53.066 --> 00:04:54.226]  And it's just going to get worse.
[00:04:54.246 --> 00:04:56.887]  I mean, my God, they did this on purpose.
[00:04:58.788 --> 00:04:59.728]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:05:01.343 --> 00:05:04.646]  To this July 22nd, Thursday edition.
[00:05:05.587 --> 00:05:07.368]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:05:11.492 --> 00:05:13.033]  Yeah, let me relax and take it real slow.
[00:05:13.073 --> 00:05:13.814]  Let me do this.
[00:05:13.874 --> 00:05:20.460]  Let me just read you some of the headlines out of the 200 or so articles and the 100 or so video clips I've got here in front of me.
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.062]  Let me just do that for you.
[00:05:23.983 --> 00:05:25.885]  And then I'll go through as much of it as I can.
[00:05:26.365 --> 00:05:27.526]  Here, let's go right over here.
[00:05:28.581 --> 00:05:30.383]  This is the Washington Post yesterday.
[00:05:30.983 --> 00:05:34.226]  We are testing too many vaccinated people who lack COVID symptoms.
[00:05:36.367 --> 00:05:39.850]  And they're saying the PCR test is 90 plus percent false positive.
[00:05:40.791 --> 00:05:50.519]  And so they should just stop testing the people that have had the vaccine and only make those of us that haven't take the test so they can then restrict us, which they admit is a fraud.
[00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:53.021]  They admit criminal, evil activity.
[00:05:53.281 --> 00:05:54.282]  That's just one article.
[00:05:54.562 --> 00:05:56.184]  Oh, and they admit Trump was right the whole time.
[00:05:57.978 --> 00:06:02.399]  When Trump wants you to believe coronavirus cases are up because they test, he's wrong.
[00:06:02.459 --> 00:06:02.679]  Really?
[00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:04.300]  That was October of last year.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.181]  That headline aged quite well, didn't it?
[00:06:08.721 --> 00:06:11.222]  Trump said more COVID-19 testing creates more cases.
[00:06:11.342 --> 00:06:15.163]  Oh, gee, we did the math and he's wrong, says the news.
[00:06:15.783 --> 00:06:15.943]  No.
[00:06:16.223 --> 00:06:18.804]  So that's a big story right there, huh?
[00:06:19.745 --> 00:06:20.045]  Get it?
[00:06:20.845 --> 00:06:23.706]  You're going to be tested because you haven't been injected with the poison.
[00:06:24.086 --> 00:06:25.406]  They're going to say you're positive.
[00:06:25.726 --> 00:06:27.567]  The contact tracers are going to take you away.
[00:06:29.124 --> 00:06:32.567]  By the way, that was announced on Austin News last night.
[00:06:33.607 --> 00:06:35.129]  I got home last night after a business dinner.
[00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:44.976]  The first thing I saw was, oh, it's a fiasco with the town hall that it ended with Biden as he publicly basically dies on stage.
[00:06:45.677 --> 00:06:47.818]  That's all that on purpose is to rub it into our faces.
[00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:49.119]  Sick joke for the globalists.
[00:06:49.179 --> 00:06:49.740]  It demoralizes.
[00:06:51.499 --> 00:06:59.922]  Before I did that, I looked at this KXAN news piece that sounds like something like a 1980s movie, like Running Man and a future dystopic thing.
[00:07:00.302 --> 00:07:03.744]  It's like, we're coming with the contact tracers to take you out of your house.
[00:07:04.724 --> 00:07:06.745]  Please comply with the contact tracers.
[00:07:07.785 --> 00:07:12.807]  And then the contact tracers we've got in Texas are controlled by Google and the Clinton Foundation.
[00:07:13.067 --> 00:07:13.828]  Can't make that up.
[00:07:14.528 --> 00:07:15.628]  Just can't make that up.
[00:07:15.668 --> 00:07:16.389]  That's a headline.
[00:07:17.529 --> 00:07:19.390]  Austin Public Health gets tested.
[00:07:20.731 --> 00:07:25.174]  For COVID-19, comply with contact tracers to help stop the spread.
[00:07:38.243 --> 00:07:43.304]  In other news, massive looting going on all over the country, and Democrat cities have passed laws allowing looting.
[00:07:43.765 --> 00:07:47.626]  Watch California shoplifters stroll out of TJ Maxx with arms full of merchandise.
[00:07:47.646 --> 00:07:50.746]  One of them looks like Santa Claus with a huge bag over their back.
[00:07:51.327 --> 00:07:55.128]  Eric Clapton says he won't play shows where proof of vaccine is required.
[00:07:55.148 --> 00:07:56.068]  That's how you push back.
[00:07:57.808 --> 00:07:58.729]  That's just some of the news.
[00:07:59.229 --> 00:08:02.690]  Let me plow through some more of the COVID takeover news, because that's everything.
[00:08:03.877 --> 00:08:07.438]  This is a video Senator Ron Johnson unloads on Fauci.
[00:08:07.458 --> 00:08:09.199]  We're going to play this next segment.
[00:08:09.619 --> 00:08:10.399]  He's culpable.
[00:08:10.459 --> 00:08:11.099]  He's lying.
[00:08:11.159 --> 00:08:12.640]  He needs to be held accountable.
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.101]  And Johnson's one of the best guys we got up there.
[00:08:15.121 --> 00:08:22.343]  He goes, this is the big media, the big corporations doing this to take our rights, suppressing treatment, suppressing news, using fake testing.
[00:08:22.663 --> 00:08:23.823]  This is a criminal takeover.
[00:08:24.323 --> 00:08:27.224]  Yes, where this is 21st century war.
[00:08:27.765 --> 00:08:29.545]  This is the modern warfare attack.
[00:08:30.005 --> 00:08:32.166]  Let's wake up to that and let's understand that.
[00:08:34.309 --> 00:08:35.270]  Austin Public Health.
[00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:37.292]  Get tested for COVID-19.
[00:08:37.352 --> 00:08:40.714]  Comply with contact tracers to help stop the spread.
[00:08:40.754 --> 00:08:43.277]  And that ties in to the next story.
[00:08:43.757 --> 00:08:52.144]  Biden administration considering urging vaccinated people to start wearing face masks again as Delta variant spreads and vaccine rollout stalls.
[00:08:52.264 --> 00:08:55.066]  You see, you must always take the shots to leave your house.
[00:08:55.206 --> 00:08:56.347]  There will always be new variants.
[00:08:56.608 --> 00:08:58.289]  You must always take new shots to leave your house.
[00:08:58.689 --> 00:09:00.190]  Oh, and then you still can't leave your house.
[00:09:00.911 --> 00:09:02.292]  As they get ready to announce new lockdowns.
[00:09:02.713 --> 00:09:09.659]  Biden gets ready for mask mandates for children under 12, because they know they're not going to end up approving it under 12.
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.362]  There's just some little speck of humanity left.
[00:09:13.843 --> 00:09:18.487]  And so, oh, we're just going to muzzle them with two masks and teach them that they're slaves.
[00:09:19.568 --> 00:09:26.193]  Meanwhile, Democrat who features in infamous maskless flight pic calls for universal mask wearing.
[00:09:26.994 --> 00:09:27.695]  Of course they do.
[00:09:29.266 --> 00:09:30.207]  And it's all over the world.
[00:09:30.287 --> 00:09:34.531]  English care homes could lose 70,000 staff over mandatory COVID jab.
[00:09:34.571 --> 00:09:36.392]  It's all fraudulent.
[00:09:37.593 --> 00:09:39.375]  And huge developments on that front.
[00:09:39.935 --> 00:09:40.296]  Shock!
[00:09:40.456 --> 00:09:45.180]  Doctor warns the majority of vaccinated patients could have permanent heart damage.
[00:09:46.161 --> 00:09:47.842]  Some may die within three years.
[00:09:47.882 --> 00:09:49.224]  That's what the studies show.
[00:09:49.804 --> 00:09:50.525]  Very powerful.
[00:09:54.099 --> 00:09:58.262]  List of UK venues that could mandate vaccine passports already expanding.
[00:09:58.883 --> 00:09:59.883]  Oh, don't worry, it's only a few places.
[00:09:59.903 --> 00:10:01.044]  Oh, now it's the grocery store.
[00:10:01.464 --> 00:10:02.405]  That'll come here as well.
[00:10:02.425 --> 00:10:07.009]  The vast majority of Cape Cod COVID clusters were vaccinated.
[00:10:07.029 --> 00:10:08.710]  Got a whole stack of all over the world.
[00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:12.693]  It's the vaccinated that are mainly dying and mainly getting sick with the actual numbers.
[00:10:12.973 --> 00:10:21.599]  But don't worry, Fauci is all over the news saying 99% of the new cases and the deaths are the unvaccinated.
[00:10:21.659 --> 00:10:22.100]  Lying to you.
[00:10:23.783 --> 00:10:28.806]  And each one of these is a inch and a half stack of articles we're going to be getting to.
[00:10:29.306 --> 00:10:37.391]  More on Ron Paul's double down, saying, Rand Paul's double down, saying that he wants criminal charges against Fauci.
[00:10:37.411 --> 00:10:42.794]  Fauci's clearly been caught lying about funding gain of function, caught as red-handed as anyone ever was.
[00:10:44.366 --> 00:10:59.594]  That ties into Communist China really getting upset, saying they don't want an investigation of Wuhan, but then starting to threaten that, hey, we had an agreement with Fort Detrick and Obama to transfer these viruses to us, so when they say, hey, the Pentagon's involved, that's true!
[00:11:00.395 --> 00:11:01.055]  Under Obama.
[00:11:02.036 --> 00:11:03.156]  Trump was not involved in this.
[00:11:03.176 --> 00:11:05.037]  I'm not just defending Trump, it's a fact.
[00:11:05.057 --> 00:11:06.258]  2017, he killed these programs.
[00:11:08.888 --> 00:11:14.532]  To the outrage of the New World Order, but China's like, hey, if you're gonna bust us, we're gonna bust you.
[00:11:14.552 --> 00:11:23.019]  So we're really getting to that critical point where it's very pregnant right now, nine months pregnant, and they're not gonna be able to keep the truth from being born.
[00:11:23.219 --> 00:11:26.722]  So very explosive point to be at.
[00:11:28.263 --> 00:11:30.005]  Right now we're gonna be talking about all of that.
[00:11:30.705 --> 00:11:35.289]  Obviously we're talking about the designed PSYOP,
[00:11:37.008 --> 00:11:54.896]  To demoralize us of having Biden, continually for an hour and a half, or however long it lasted, it seemed like 10 hours long, of the town hall last night, self-destructing, melting down, actual dementia, on stage, not knowing where he was, completely full of horse crap.
[00:11:57.437 --> 00:12:00.878]  Again, I've had family members die in front of me that were more cogent than this.
[00:12:01.499 --> 00:12:02.339]  I mean, this was...
[00:12:05.043 --> 00:12:07.304]  And look, they're all laughing at him, too.
[00:12:08.525 --> 00:12:20.131]  And by the way, they mainly only had Democrat Party staff, they admit now, and they also had people that work for the network that hosts the town hall there in attendance.
[00:12:20.171 --> 00:12:22.593]  But they were laughing at Joe Biden.
[00:12:22.813 --> 00:12:25.094]  I mean, because it's all about laughing in America.
[00:12:25.494 --> 00:12:26.155]  That's coming up.
[00:12:27.135 --> 00:12:28.476]  And I've only scratched the surface.
[00:12:30.009 --> 00:12:39.095]  What we're going to be breaking down, there's also an excellent article at Zero Hedge, Klaus Schwab, the humanist, versus Klaus Schwab, the terrorist.
[00:12:39.536 --> 00:12:48.022]  And that's really what they are, is environmental terrorists, who clander doing all this to bring down human society, to save the earth from us, but really, they're transhumanists playing God.
[00:12:49.744 --> 00:12:51.625]  That is all coming up as well.
[00:12:51.905 --> 00:13:03.092]  And we've got Biden regime promotes racial justice guide, pushing students and teachers to quote, disrupt whiteness and remove whiteness from America.
[00:13:03.512 --> 00:13:05.654]  Sounds a lot like genocide.
[00:13:06.394 --> 00:13:08.976]  So that's all going to be broken down.
[00:13:08.996 --> 00:13:15.860]  But the first thing I want to hit is big tech and the big media working in this combine
[00:13:18.117 --> 00:13:26.679]  And it ties into the short little piece we're going to play of Senator Ron Johnson talking about the culpability of Fauci and others.
[00:13:27.239 --> 00:13:31.540]  How big tech isn't just censoring, they're murdering people.
[00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:34.461]  They're murdering your ability to get medical care.
[00:13:34.521 --> 00:13:35.981]  They're murdering your ability to get the truth.
[00:13:36.321 --> 00:13:40.102]  They're murdering your ability to get treatments that are basically 100% effective.
[00:13:40.842 --> 00:13:42.603]  And they are murdering our republic.
[00:13:42.703 --> 00:13:43.843]  And they are criminals.
[00:13:43.883 --> 00:13:44.743]  They are terrorists.
[00:13:45.264 --> 00:13:46.844]  They are terrorists.
[00:13:48.356 --> 00:13:57.459]  They are now banning mainline news sites that point out vaccine injection, experimental injection of children without parole consent is illegal.
[00:13:57.839 --> 00:13:59.159]  YouTube is now banning that.
[00:13:59.599 --> 00:14:02.140]  I mean, they are raping us.
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:07.722]  They are suppressing us while there's depopulation, sterilization operations carried out.
[00:14:07.782 --> 00:14:08.542]  They are terrorists.
[00:14:09.654 --> 00:14:13.096]  All right, finally, finally, Congress gets the big picture.
[00:14:13.657 --> 00:14:29.987]  This is a premeditated, launched, multinational, globalist, UN, big tech, Fortune 100, Chi-Com Alliance, New World Order attack on the Western world, on the middle class, on small businesses, on ranchers, on farmers, on
[00:14:31.581 --> 00:14:32.682]  What's left of the Western world?
[00:14:32.702 --> 00:14:34.082]  This is a consolidation of power.
[00:14:34.142 --> 00:14:37.084]  China's doubled its power, doubled its profits the last year.
[00:14:37.444 --> 00:14:39.265]  So have all the big tech, so have all the big banks.
[00:14:39.605 --> 00:14:44.548]  They are assaulting us viciously, preparing another forced worldwide lockdown.
[00:14:45.448 --> 00:14:46.029]  And look at this!
[00:14:46.909 --> 00:14:51.531]  YouTube deletes family research council video about vaccinating minors against parental consent.
[00:14:52.052 --> 00:14:55.113]  So they can cover up the criminal activity going on.
[00:14:55.833 --> 00:15:00.636]  YouTube deletes 15 videos from Brazilian President Bolsonaro channel for COVID quote misinformation.
[00:15:01.176 --> 00:15:04.578]  Which again says it came out of a lab and says hydroxychloroquine helps you.
[00:15:04.798 --> 00:15:05.718]  They want to suppress you.
[00:15:05.738 --> 00:15:06.699]  They want to terrorize you.
[00:15:06.919 --> 00:15:08.080]  They want to literally rape you.
[00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:10.021]  And so that's what we're gonna be breaking down.
[00:15:10.061 --> 00:15:10.561]  But first,
[00:15:12.022 --> 00:15:12.902]  I want to point this out.
[00:15:13.042 --> 00:15:17.863]  This video on Facebook, on Twitter, on Instagram had millions and millions of views, different versions.
[00:15:18.383 --> 00:15:20.723]  They've been pulling it down, calling it vaccine disinfo.
[00:15:21.184 --> 00:15:30.985]  So, vaccine disinfo from a time machine three years ago, I'm going to play this clip next segment, watch Alex Jones predict a lockdown for manufactured virus pandemic in 2018.
[00:15:31.145 --> 00:15:34.506]  They're not banning it because it's false, they're banning it because it's true.
[00:15:35.326 --> 00:15:39.147]  So now if somebody wrote a book a hundred years ago about a stage pandemic, would you ban it?
[00:15:39.627 --> 00:15:41.187]  V for Vendetta's about that.
[00:15:43.234 --> 00:15:44.495]  You're gonna ban V for Vendetta now?
[00:15:44.955 --> 00:15:46.396]  This is how controlled they are.
[00:15:46.817 --> 00:15:50.319]  Here's part of Senator Johnson knocking it out of the park on Fox News.
[00:15:56.164 --> 00:15:56.604]  Wow!
[00:15:56.724 --> 00:16:03.447]  Senator Rand Paul says that now Faction will be the subject of a criminal referral in a new letter to the Department of Justice.
[00:16:03.527 --> 00:16:11.051]  Joining me right now with more on this is Wisconsin Senator, member of the Senate Homeland Security Foreign Relations Budget Committees, Ron Johnson.
[00:16:11.371 --> 00:16:13.312]  Senator, it's wonderful to see you again.
[00:16:13.352 --> 00:16:14.852]  Thanks very much for being here.
[00:16:15.313 --> 00:16:19.234]  Weigh in on what you just heard in terms of gain-of-function research.
[00:16:19.354 --> 00:16:22.356]  Was it taking place in the Wuhan lab of virology?
[00:16:23.938 --> 00:16:24.579]  Good morning, Maria.
[00:16:24.659 --> 00:16:29.002]  And of course, Dr. Fauci funded gain-of-function research.
[00:16:29.042 --> 00:16:30.263]  He can deny it all he wants.
[00:16:30.643 --> 00:16:40.730]  He can have his staff, who are beholden to him for their jobs, claim that somehow what is clearly gain-of-function research isn't gain-of-function research, but it was.
[00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:41.931]  He's culpable.
[00:16:42.351 --> 00:16:43.332]  He's lying about it.
[00:16:43.952 --> 00:16:45.994]  And he needs to be held accountable for it.
[00:16:46.054 --> 00:16:47.395]  We've written letters to
[00:16:49.356 --> 00:16:53.179]  Francis Collins, I guess his ultimate boss, the director of NIH.
[00:16:53.659 --> 00:16:55.320]  We're getting no response whatsoever.
[00:16:55.340 --> 00:17:00.364]  So the federal government, these federal health agencies have to become transparent.
[00:17:00.764 --> 00:17:17.696]  And I, for one, really appreciate what Senator Paul did in that hearing to expose really his equivocation on this, his lying about what he did and didn't fund, and his potential role in the development of a chimeric coronavirus that is now infecting the world.
[00:17:19.574 --> 00:17:21.715]  So you're calling for accountability.
[00:17:21.775 --> 00:17:24.875]  What do you want to see happen to Anthony Fauci?
[00:17:25.436 --> 00:17:28.596]  And also, I mean, look, they're not being transparent.
[00:17:28.616 --> 00:17:29.817]  You're calling for transparency.
[00:17:29.937 --> 00:17:31.257]  They're not being transparent.
[00:17:31.317 --> 00:17:38.199]  And social media and much of the media is going along with it, censoring all of this information, leaving the American people in the dark.
[00:17:39.392 --> 00:17:43.294]  Well, first of all, the evidence of this has been hiding in plain sight for months.
[00:17:43.374 --> 00:17:44.635]  Actually, probably for years.
[00:17:45.516 --> 00:17:47.557]  All people really had to do was take a look at it.
[00:17:48.057 --> 00:17:55.402]  And that's what is so disingenuous about Dr. Fauci right now trying to disclaim any involvement in gain-of-function research.
[00:17:55.942 --> 00:18:01.486]  And quite honestly, I think it's pretty obvious, too, that this coronavirus was not naturally occurring.
[00:18:01.546 --> 00:18:02.406]  It was man-made.
[00:18:02.426 --> 00:18:03.527]  It's a chimeric virus.
[00:18:04.088 --> 00:18:05.609]  Again, that has been obvious for months.
[00:18:05.989 --> 00:18:08.230]  So, the American people deserve the truth.
[00:18:08.451 --> 00:18:10.692]  Really, the people of the world deserve the truth on this.
[00:18:11.332 --> 00:18:20.318]  And unfortunately, because of the cabal between social media, mainstream media, and our federal health agencies and big government, we're not getting the truth.
[00:18:20.459 --> 00:18:23.881]  The truth has been covered up for months, whether we're talking about
[00:18:24.301 --> 00:18:24.602]  What?
[00:18:39.788 --> 00:18:54.314]  It's interesting because the other day, Jen Psaki pretty much admitted that, said, oh yes, you know, we in the administration are in very close contact with social media to pretty much censor information that they didn't want out there.
[00:18:54.734 --> 00:18:56.975]  Will there be accountability on big tech?
[00:18:59.418 --> 00:19:12.608]  That's really up to the public to hold them accountable, to start switching their alliance from these platforms to other platforms that actually allow free speech, that won't cooperate and collaborate and collude with big government.
[00:19:13.208 --> 00:19:15.470]  Social media has become Big Brother.
[00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:20.894]  It's the Big Brother arm of big government, and it should concern and frighten every American.
[00:19:24.303 --> 00:19:26.284]  Let me let me know what you're going to do about it.
[00:19:26.324 --> 00:19:28.024]  I mean, the Republicans talk about this.
[00:19:28.084 --> 00:19:34.506]  Is there any way you can actually do something about it to bring these companies down to size?
[00:19:34.966 --> 00:19:42.789]  We know that, you know, there's this fake fight going on between President Biden and Facebook, which I'm not buying because they're working together.
[00:19:43.049 --> 00:19:53.172]  What are your thoughts in terms of Section 230 or legislatively changing the prospects for these companies that have become incredibly dominant?
[00:19:54.244 --> 00:20:03.470]  Well, because the media that is colluding with the Democrat Party favors the Democrats, the legislative were probably not going to be able to do a whole lot about this, not in the near future.
[00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:05.872]  What we need to do is we need to expose the truth.
[00:20:06.372 --> 00:20:09.214]  It's one of the reasons I held an event where I just allowed
[00:20:09.654 --> 00:20:15.676]  Five women and a 13-year-old girl tell their story about possible vaccine injuries, and of course you know how that went over.
[00:20:16.216 --> 00:20:28.580]  Instead of showing even an ounce of sympathy for these people to at least have acknowledged that it might be a vaccine so you get to the root cause and develop effective treatments, instead news media attacked me for allowing them to tell their stories.
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:30.581]  I just received this morning
[00:20:31.061 --> 00:20:31.882]  Let's stop right there.
[00:20:52.967 --> 00:20:58.288]  Ron Johnson's a great guy, I'd love to be president, but he's also a very good person, so he has blind spots.
[00:20:58.988 --> 00:21:02.509]  I guess he doesn't have a wicked streak down his back like I do, so I see all these enemies' operations.
[00:21:02.829 --> 00:21:04.090]  Like I said, I'm in Satan's brain.
[00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:08.351]  And I think you're in Satan's brain as well, because God's given you discernment.
[00:21:09.371 --> 00:21:13.412]  We said over a year and a half ago, they're going to say new variants are the reason the vaccine doesn't work.
[00:21:13.812 --> 00:21:17.993]  You can't have a vaccine for a cold virus, there's thousands of different types every year.
[00:21:20.113 --> 00:21:22.675]  And Gates' own document said there'll be yearly boosters.
[00:21:22.735 --> 00:21:23.316]  They knew that.
[00:21:23.636 --> 00:21:24.477]  It's a fraud.
[00:21:24.557 --> 00:21:26.818]  It gets rid of your immune system.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.522]  And Johnson's like, can't I have a Senate hearing with families?
[00:21:32.703 --> 00:21:33.803]  Why does Google censor it?
[00:21:33.823 --> 00:21:34.784]  Why does Twitter censor it?
[00:21:35.305 --> 00:21:37.366]  Because they're all going to go to prison if it comes out.
[00:21:37.406 --> 00:21:39.067]  They're all invested in big tech.
[00:21:39.688 --> 00:21:42.210]  Big tech is heavily invested in big pharma.
[00:21:43.268 --> 00:21:47.931]  And you have the warnings on these shots that can give you heart attacks and strokes and Guillain-Barre.
[00:21:48.452 --> 00:21:53.395]  But see, the Senator's still at the point of, oh, can't we just have a hearing to see if it's hurting somebody?
[00:21:54.807 --> 00:21:58.369]  Why don't you have a hearing of pouring a gallon of gasoline on yourself and lighting it?
[00:21:58.389 --> 00:21:58.829]  It hurts!
[00:21:59.649 --> 00:22:00.630]  Or maybe it catches fire.
[00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:02.490]  We don't need a hearing about it.
[00:22:03.031 --> 00:22:04.731]  We know damn well what's going on.
[00:22:04.972 --> 00:22:11.815]  We need hearings about how we need to take back the FBI and the federal government and arrest the heads of Google, Facebook, and the rest of them.
[00:22:12.015 --> 00:22:12.975]  I mean, seriously!
[00:22:13.175 --> 00:22:16.157]  They are assaulting the living hell out of everybody!
[00:22:17.757 --> 00:22:21.619]  I read to you Operation Lockstep three years ago, and Aaron again ten years ago.
[00:22:21.639 --> 00:22:23.360]  We wrote articles about it when it first came out.
[00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:33.960]  And now they're deleting stuff that's reposted on Facebook and Twitter that I said three years ago about disinformation about this currently because I called their ass out!
[00:22:34.701 --> 00:22:35.221]  Murderers!
[00:22:36.397 --> 00:22:40.859]  You know, if I seem angry here on my own show, the Alex Jones Show, it's because I am angry.
[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:57.287]  I mean, all I do is study these liars, and I watch them change their story every day, I watch them lie to everybody, I watch them say, oh, 99% of people dying didn't have the vaccine, and then it turns out the majority dying had the vaccine, and the vaccine's killing them, and they're calling it COVID.
[00:22:57.307 --> 00:23:02.950]  And then they're saying, those of us that don't take it, it's our fault when none of that even makes sense.
[00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:04.871]  If you're supposedly protected, you're protected.
[00:23:06.889 --> 00:23:32.870]  This is a giant scam, and then the main guy over the main bio-research lab in the UK, who's studying for John Hopkins and the whole world, whether or not these vaccines work, these so-called vaccines that are genetic engineering, and he goes, oh yeah, once you take the Pfizer shot, it reduces your immune system by six times, and you gotta keep taking shots forever.
[00:23:34.011 --> 00:23:35.312]  He just says it out in the open!
[00:23:37.571 --> 00:23:38.592]  Like everything they do.
[00:23:39.572 --> 00:23:43.955]  Joe Biden said last night, he said, if you take the vaccine, you cannot get COVID.
[00:23:45.676 --> 00:23:48.318]  What he means by that is pneumonia, the flu, a cold.
[00:23:48.538 --> 00:23:49.158]  It's a lie.
[00:23:49.659 --> 00:23:52.560]  It actually lowers your immune system so you'll get stuff.
[00:23:52.761 --> 00:23:58.924]  And when you die, they'll say it's COVID and a new variant while saying you're invincible.
[00:23:59.125 --> 00:24:00.826]  I mean, it's just in your face.
[00:24:01.246 --> 00:24:04.428]  Like you walk on a car lot and it's a burned out Pinto from 1971.
[00:24:07.372 --> 00:24:15.534]  Or a burned out Gremlin from 1975, and you go, this is a brand new Ferrari, with leather seats, from Italy.
[00:24:16.535 --> 00:24:18.115]  You go, it's a burned out Pinto.
[00:24:18.295 --> 00:24:18.996]  They go, no it's not.
[00:24:20.496 --> 00:24:28.358]  So you go on the internet, you type, well, I went to this weird car lot, and they had a burned out car, it was a Ferrari, this guy's crazy.
[00:24:28.959 --> 00:24:33.520]  But imagine if he controls big tech, he won't let you talk, and he'll say, this is a Ferrari.
[00:24:36.553 --> 00:24:37.693]  And sit there and gaslight you.
[00:24:37.913 --> 00:24:39.094]  This is ridiculous.
[00:24:39.974 --> 00:24:43.195]  They're in the news saying, oh, stop testing the vaccinated.
[00:24:43.995 --> 00:24:48.377]  Then when they say they're positive, there won't be a problem because they won't be tested.
[00:24:51.197 --> 00:24:57.059]  But test the people that have been vaccinated with the fake PCR test and say they're asymptomatic and lock them up.
[00:24:57.179 --> 00:24:59.600]  I mean, it's all happening in live time.
[00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:01.320]  The murder of logic.
[00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:02.781]  And we're all supposed to go along with it.
[00:25:02.801 --> 00:25:03.141]  Here it is.
[00:25:05.014 --> 00:25:07.026]  This video went out a few weeks ago.
[00:25:07.066 --> 00:25:08.313]  Jeremy Green put it out on...
[00:25:09.827 --> 00:25:11.988]  June 2nd, so I guess over a month ago.
[00:25:12.649 --> 00:25:16.851]  Watch Alex Jones predict the lockdown for manufactured virus in 2018.
[00:25:17.692 --> 00:25:20.114]  Nobody really cares at Vandot Video about this video.
[00:25:20.734 --> 00:25:23.416]  And Darren put articles over it, made it look slick, did a great job.
[00:25:23.896 --> 00:25:27.398]  This thing, last time I even tried to count, had like 8 million views online.
[00:25:27.958 --> 00:25:29.359]  They took down all the versions.
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:34.383]  So now people repost it and it gets like a million views a day on Instagram or Twitter.
[00:25:34.723 --> 00:25:35.984]  Everybody's sending it to me.
[00:25:36.784 --> 00:25:38.346]  Members of Congress are sending it to me.
[00:25:38.606 --> 00:25:40.127]  Pop talk show hosts are sending it to me.
[00:25:40.147 --> 00:25:42.910]  And this is just one little clip of my predictions from 2018.
[00:25:43.291 --> 00:25:47.495]  I just come back from Hawaii on a vacation, growing my beard for the first time.
[00:25:48.095 --> 00:25:51.179]  But the reason they took it down is they said it's disinformation.
[00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:54.021]  So how is it from three years ago?
[00:25:55.290 --> 00:26:03.372]  Before the COVID thing came out, but it's still disinfo COVID-19 because it's powerful, because it's truthful, and it's off documents.
[00:26:03.392 --> 00:26:07.993]  But McBreen's gone and actually found the full clip since folks said, oh, this must be fake.
[00:26:08.213 --> 00:26:08.853]  This isn't real.
[00:26:09.033 --> 00:26:14.795]  So it found the full clip of me in the podcast studio talking about it, and that's on Banned.Video right now.
[00:26:15.515 --> 00:26:17.556]  With a whole bunch of predictions even more powerful.
[00:26:17.856 --> 00:26:19.157]  But they weren't predictions.
[00:26:19.257 --> 00:26:23.259]  It's from the criminals and their own documents preparing it.
[00:26:23.639 --> 00:26:24.799]  Operation Lockstep.
[00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:26.160]  Crimson Contagion.
[00:26:28.041 --> 00:26:31.803]  We will establish our new world order through the virus sphere.
[00:26:32.163 --> 00:26:33.964]  And then through global power outage.
[00:26:34.264 --> 00:26:37.605]  This will save the Earth from the overbloom of our species.
[00:26:38.426 --> 00:26:39.826]  These are quotes from Klaus Schwab.
[00:26:40.407 --> 00:26:42.768]  So now I'm bracing for massive control power outages.
[00:26:44.435 --> 00:26:45.636]  Now they're telling you they're eminent.
[00:26:45.876 --> 00:26:47.077]  I mean, ha ha!
[00:26:50.459 --> 00:26:52.120]  This is all going down.
[00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:56.463]  Now there's food shortages all over the country.
[00:26:57.544 --> 00:27:03.608]  Major grocery stores are empty of food, especially in blue cities and Democrat areas, because they're so criminally run.
[00:27:05.097 --> 00:27:07.018]  And now it's starting to come to Texas grocery stores.
[00:27:07.358 --> 00:27:08.718]  In England, empty store shelves.
[00:27:09.138 --> 00:27:10.319]  Supply chain breakdown.
[00:27:10.619 --> 00:27:14.801]  An artificial collapse of society has been initiated.
[00:27:15.061 --> 00:27:18.362]  And when it all happens, folks go, Jones is like Nostradamus.
[00:27:19.082 --> 00:27:19.742]  I love the other thing.
[00:27:19.782 --> 00:27:25.845]  I saw like a tweet with 20,000 retweets yesterday saying, I used to like Jones, but he's one of them.
[00:27:25.865 --> 00:27:27.785]  They're giving him all the secret info.
[00:27:28.085 --> 00:27:29.346]  The secret info?
[00:27:29.566 --> 00:27:31.927]  They write books telling you how they're going to do this to you.
[00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:37.021]  Can't you wake up and take responsibility?
[00:27:37.322 --> 00:27:38.622]  I'm talking to that guy on Twitter.
[00:27:39.123 --> 00:27:44.987]  And know this for yourself, can't you watch the video where I tell you it's from Operation Lockstep, dumbass?
[00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:56.592]  But see, they won't go research, so they attribute to me magical powers or I'm a federal operative who's been given the secret briefing.
[00:27:56.852 --> 00:28:07.715]  I'm gonna explain this again, because I do hard work and I research sometimes up to 10 hours a day, open source, actual government documents and corporate research papers and corporate finance papers.
[00:28:08.195 --> 00:28:11.496]  I know more than almost everybody because I work the most.
[00:28:12.216 --> 00:28:14.797]  I don't call the CIA and the FBI and get information.
[00:28:14.977 --> 00:28:15.697]  They listen to me.
[00:28:16.537 --> 00:28:20.498]  I don't sit there and tune in to other shows to find all my information.
[00:28:20.698 --> 00:28:21.899]  I get it from raw research.
[00:28:22.219 --> 00:28:23.379]  And it's not about bragging.
[00:28:24.079 --> 00:28:27.900]  But I cannot believe, like the superstition, how does Jones know this?
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:32.182]  Because our damn enemies are doing it to us in front of everybody!
[00:28:32.842 --> 00:28:33.442]  That's why!
[00:28:36.172 --> 00:28:37.732]  Bill Gates says he wants to kill you.
[00:28:37.892 --> 00:28:38.753]  He's starting to do it.
[00:28:39.573 --> 00:28:46.014]  And I explained, this virus and the deadly vaccine isn't going to kill as many as global starvation and the wars that come out of it.
[00:28:46.714 --> 00:28:56.037]  They know when they push, the average poor person pass half their money, half their paycheck on food, the breakdown starts.
[00:28:57.317 --> 00:28:58.997]  Then people riot and burn everything down.
[00:28:59.357 --> 00:29:00.298]  Then they starve to death.
[00:29:00.498 --> 00:29:03.038]  Then the UN organizes them as armies to invade us.
[00:29:04.619 --> 00:29:05.339]  So you think about this.
[00:29:06.907 --> 00:29:10.109]  LifeSite News comes out and says it's U.S.
[00:29:10.169 --> 00:29:19.516]  state and federal law that you can't forcibly inoculate or trick someone under the age of 17 to have an inoculation, and anybody doing it is criminal.
[00:29:20.236 --> 00:29:22.758]  They show the law in a report, YouTube bans it.
[00:29:23.379 --> 00:29:25.280]  Bolsonaro does similar things.
[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:28.202]  The President of Brazil, he's banned.
[00:29:28.382 --> 00:29:29.303]  His videos are removed.
[00:29:30.123 --> 00:29:32.325]  Members of Congress have hearings, they're removed.
[00:29:35.438 --> 00:29:36.779]  Governor DeSantis has hearings.
[00:29:36.919 --> 00:29:37.480]  It's removed.
[00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:41.803]  This is organized crime covering up the crimes they've committed.
[00:29:42.063 --> 00:29:43.705]  Google's invested at Wuhan.
[00:29:44.205 --> 00:29:45.706]  Facebook's invested at Wuhan.
[00:29:46.027 --> 00:29:48.309]  Facebook is heavily involved running it.
[00:29:48.849 --> 00:29:51.111]  Facebook employees work in Wuhan.
[00:29:51.471 --> 00:29:52.032]  Look it up!
[00:29:52.772 --> 00:29:54.834]  They're running these attacks on us.
[00:29:54.894 --> 00:29:55.675]  Of course they are!
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:06.167]  And then I get up here and I simply try to warn you off their own documents how they say they're going to bring in world government using A, B, C, and D.
[00:30:07.725 --> 00:30:16.390]  How they're going to collapse the third world by cutting off resources during global lockdown, then they're going to organize the third world to flood the western world and collapse society.
[00:30:16.911 --> 00:30:19.712]  That's in the damn document lockstep!
[00:30:20.032 --> 00:30:21.333]  And now we're living it!
[00:30:22.014 --> 00:30:27.797]  It's like we broke Hitler's code in 1941 but didn't use it with the Enigma machines, but we did!
[00:30:28.057 --> 00:30:33.761]  We have their communications, we have their damn plan, and we're living their damn plan!
[00:30:35.592 --> 00:30:38.336]  But the general public cannot believe they're under assault.
[00:30:38.416 --> 00:30:39.017]  It's too scary.
[00:30:39.037 --> 00:30:40.179]  Let me tell you what's going to be scary.
[00:30:40.399 --> 00:30:42.262]  The next phases of it if we don't stop them.
[00:30:44.925 --> 00:30:46.968]  So imagine this little one minute clip.
[00:30:47.864 --> 00:30:56.354]  That's gotten tens of millions, I say, I counted up like six million views the other day without even trying, oh my gosh, three million here, two million there, a million there, all gone, all taken off the internet.
[00:30:56.634 --> 00:31:05.304]  They don't want you to see this madman reading off a Globalist Fortune 100, you know, big foundation document, here it is.
[00:31:06.212 --> 00:31:15.318]  Globalists have said in their white papers, in their own UN documents, that they want to create race-specific bioweapons and other systems to depopulate the planet.
[00:31:15.558 --> 00:31:22.703]  A lot of this, from my sources, is that they're preparing to release bioweapons, claim that they're naturally occurring.
[00:31:23.183 --> 00:31:29.390]  And then use that as the cover for civil emergencies, societal control, crackdowns on free speech.
[00:31:29.651 --> 00:31:32.154]  Obama put the internet kill switch in five years ago.
[00:31:32.174 --> 00:31:37.880]  And when he got confronted by Congress, he said, well, it's in case the bird flu or SARS gets out.
[00:31:38.201 --> 00:31:38.861]  Just type that in.
[00:31:39.622 --> 00:31:47.905]  CDC says internet kill switch is in case bird flu or SARS breaks out, and they have to control panic and direct every website in the U.S.
[00:31:48.245 --> 00:31:49.686]  to one government announcement.
[00:31:49.786 --> 00:31:58.649]  And we looked at every angle and believe a bioweapon release could be the thing they'd release to bring in a world government to counter a global problem, and the U.N.
[00:31:58.669 --> 00:32:03.371]  has said that a global pandemic is the only thing that may save their world government.
[00:32:03.611 --> 00:32:04.351]  InfoWars.
[00:32:04.451 --> 00:32:05.352]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:32:05.532 --> 00:32:05.792]  Today.
[00:32:06.278 --> 00:32:10.040]  All right, I've already covered a good amount of news, but nothing compared to what I'm going to cover next hour.
[00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:12.801]  I'm doing the whole show today.
[00:32:14.161 --> 00:32:14.642]  No guests.
[00:32:14.902 --> 00:32:16.402]  In fact, I'm not planning to take calls either.
[00:32:16.422 --> 00:32:20.144]  I need to cover every bit of this, and I've only gotten in about 10%.
[00:32:21.605 --> 00:32:22.385]  It's all critical.
[00:32:22.425 --> 00:32:24.306]  I'm asking you to stay tuned and listen carefully.
[00:32:25.526 --> 00:32:31.809]  Now, I was about to come in here and say the next thing is going to be a staged cyber attack and the takedown of large parts of the grid.
[00:32:32.249 --> 00:32:33.850]  They'll see how we respond to that.
[00:32:34.773 --> 00:32:36.054]  They'll see if they get away with it.
[00:32:36.094 --> 00:32:38.536]  They're going to hit us with incrementally bigger ones.
[00:32:39.077 --> 00:32:41.759]  And that's the attack profile of the enemy, and I'll explain why next hour.
[00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:45.602]  They just walked up during the break and handed me three things.
[00:32:45.902 --> 00:32:46.243]  Crew did.
[00:32:46.263 --> 00:32:48.304]  This is breaking right now.
[00:32:49.125 --> 00:32:52.228]  CNBC, NBC, and others.
[00:32:53.669 --> 00:32:56.511]  Several major websites go down in widespread Internet outage.
[00:32:56.912 --> 00:33:00.735]  Widespread outage disrupts major retail, financial, travel websites worldwide.
[00:33:02.796 --> 00:33:05.078]  You say, oh, well that's just, you know, coincidence.
[00:33:05.138 --> 00:33:05.298]  No.
[00:33:05.718 --> 00:33:18.309]  Klaus Schwab, and again, the Davos Group, financing through the Rockefeller Foundation, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, put out Cyber Polygon last year that I've been harping on.
[00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:20.191]  And why?
[00:33:20.231 --> 00:33:26.436]  Because the battle plans put out by John Hopkins are the ones most often adopted.
[00:33:26.696 --> 00:33:28.918]  Because when you read that, that means Rockefeller Foundation.
[00:33:30.928 --> 00:33:31.669]  And why is that?
[00:33:31.769 --> 00:33:35.052]  Well, because they were the first to clone humans successfully in the 50s.
[00:33:36.293 --> 00:33:44.439]  And they've got, basically, it's like an iceberg tip of a big giant umbrella corporation.
[00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:49.203]  And I say that like the Hollywood movie, Resident Evil Umbrella Corporation.
[00:33:50.364 --> 00:33:53.087]  And so everything you think about something like that, that's John Hopkins.
[00:33:54.395 --> 00:34:07.361]  And by the way, I'll even be sitting there with really smart MIT scientists and other people, and they'll say to me, Alex, I hear you talking about animal and human clones, but aren't they just growing the tissue of humans as clone tissue?
[00:34:07.381 --> 00:34:08.341]  And I say, that too?
[00:34:08.802 --> 00:34:16.005]  Let me show you your own MIT website, 25 years ago, humanoids being grown inside the universes of cows.
[00:34:16.025 --> 00:34:20.667]  And I show them, they read at the dinner table for 10 minutes and just go, I'm speechless, I was never told this.
[00:34:21.327 --> 00:34:21.928]  And I'm like, yeah.
[00:34:22.990 --> 00:34:24.630]  Because you're compartmentalized.
[00:34:25.191 --> 00:34:26.871]  I am not compartmentalized.
[00:34:27.431 --> 00:34:34.893]  And my mission is not to be the priesthood where I'm compartmentalized, I know everything going on, and then you don't know anything and I manipulate you.
[00:34:35.233 --> 00:34:36.393]  That's how it works.
[00:34:36.953 --> 00:34:41.535]  That's not good for civilization, it's not good for society, and it lets corrupt groups get into power.
[00:34:41.595 --> 00:34:51.037]  And this group is a post-human group that believes they're going to merge with machines and become gods, and are running a depopulation operation, not to save the Earth, but to get rid of their competition!
[00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:57.914]  So I'm going to hit that next hour, right when we start that hour.
[00:34:57.934 --> 00:35:01.237]  And I'm going to hit everything else.
[00:35:01.297 --> 00:35:08.705]  But I mean, I really have reached the point of my head is spinning because this is all moving so incredibly quickly now.
[00:35:08.745 --> 00:35:09.806]  In fact, where did my stat go?
[00:35:09.846 --> 00:35:10.287]  I just had it.
[00:35:10.307 --> 00:35:13.310]  Just had it in front of me and I can't even keep track of it anymore.
[00:35:19.244 --> 00:35:22.086]  I mean, at a point, why even keep proving this?
[00:35:22.186 --> 00:35:23.067]  It's out in the open.
[00:35:23.447 --> 00:35:24.208]  It's going on.
[00:35:24.969 --> 00:35:36.698]  We have a ruling class that's broken the social agreement, that's broken the social compact, and is waging war on us, doing it through shadowy cut-out groups.
[00:35:38.439 --> 00:35:39.440]  That's how they're operating.
[00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:40.161]  That's what they're doing.
[00:35:42.162 --> 00:35:43.903]  And they admit they're doing it.
[00:35:44.404 --> 00:35:54.271]  And they say, if you think COVID was bad, wait until we launch the, I mean, wait till the terrorists launch the, the cyber bodyguards.
[00:35:54.291 --> 00:35:56.993]  Oh, I mean, the cyber attack.
[00:35:57.133 --> 00:35:57.734]  Oh, yes.
[00:36:00.916 --> 00:36:01.376]  So it's here.
[00:36:03.098 --> 00:36:07.120]  And I got a bunch of clips of warehouses breaking down and
[00:36:09.155 --> 00:36:12.478]  We've got some old pool chairs that are like six years old and broke and fell apart.
[00:36:12.939 --> 00:36:17.704]  And my wife's like, for a few months, she's like, I can't order pool furniture anywhere.
[00:36:17.804 --> 00:36:18.645]  Everything's sold out.
[00:36:21.101 --> 00:36:22.342]  And I said, go to Amazon and buy it.
[00:36:22.362 --> 00:36:22.782]  It'll be there.
[00:36:22.802 --> 00:36:24.923]  And she said, I said, I thought you said don't shop at Amazon.
[00:36:24.943 --> 00:36:27.464]  And I said, it's just a learning experience.
[00:36:28.104 --> 00:36:31.045]  Only these big companies are going to be able to have supply chain now.
[00:36:31.445 --> 00:36:32.966]  She goes, yeah, they've got all the chairs there.
[00:36:33.006 --> 00:36:33.626]  They're ready to ship.
[00:36:33.646 --> 00:36:35.367]  And I said, yeah, no one else does.
[00:36:35.687 --> 00:36:39.028]  Not the Austin companies, not the national companies, not anybody.
[00:36:39.248 --> 00:36:41.009]  You go to local stores, they don't have pool chairs.
[00:36:41.069 --> 00:36:41.629]  Nobody's got it.
[00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:42.850]  Only Amazon's got it.
[00:36:43.570 --> 00:36:44.851]  That's the future.
[00:36:44.891 --> 00:36:46.491]  Walmart and Amazon and Target got it.
[00:36:46.812 --> 00:36:47.592]  Nobody else does.
[00:36:48.817 --> 00:36:52.980]  They've spent the last year and a half buying up everything, shutting off the supply chains.
[00:36:54.481 --> 00:36:56.182]  This is monopoly capitalism.
[00:36:56.202 --> 00:36:57.183]  This is fascism.
[00:36:57.463 --> 00:37:00.245]  This is intense warfare against humanity.
[00:37:00.525 --> 00:37:05.829]  This is the social safety net and the social compact broken.
[00:37:07.605 --> 00:37:09.907]  People ask, where is the charcoal toothpaste?
[00:37:10.367 --> 00:37:15.411]  The feds came after our silver toothpaste, said we were evil, bad, said we were saying things we didn't say.
[00:37:15.972 --> 00:37:20.715]  That went away, because I said, I'm not going to sell it anymore, because they kept accusing me of making claims I wasn't.
[00:37:20.976 --> 00:37:22.497]  So we put out charcoal toothpaste.
[00:37:23.878 --> 00:37:24.859]  High quality version.
[00:37:25.959 --> 00:37:26.800]  Became a best seller.
[00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:27.821]  It's been a year.
[00:37:29.923 --> 00:37:30.563]  Can't get it in.
[00:37:32.204 --> 00:37:32.725]  Can't get it in.
[00:37:32.865 --> 00:37:33.826]  It just, you can't get it.
[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:36.421]  Can I get some crap from China?
[00:37:36.801 --> 00:37:37.642]  Full of garbage?
[00:37:37.682 --> 00:37:37.882]  Yeah.
[00:37:38.162 --> 00:37:39.423]  Can I make something in the U.S.
[00:37:39.463 --> 00:37:40.044]  high quality?
[00:37:40.084 --> 00:37:40.324]  No.
[00:37:41.204 --> 00:37:41.665]  Can't do it.
[00:37:41.685 --> 00:37:42.145]  It's gone.
[00:37:43.826 --> 00:37:45.628]  What do you think that means to our economy?
[00:37:45.768 --> 00:37:47.149]  What do you think that means in the future?
[00:37:47.589 --> 00:37:48.370]  What do you think it means?
[00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:50.031]  It means a purposeful breakdown.
[00:37:50.051 --> 00:37:55.875]  So I'm not bitching, but I told my crew a couple months ago, they said, boss, we don't have enough money to keep operating in the future.
[00:37:55.915 --> 00:37:56.716]  And I said, don't worry.
[00:37:57.176 --> 00:37:59.298]  We're not gonna be able to order most of the products anymore anyways.
[00:38:00.345 --> 00:38:19.310]  So I basically took everything I had out of my own personal bank account and everything else, started selling my house, went out and got a loan, you name it, mortgaged my house before I went to sell it, and just said, buy everything you can now, because it's going to get worse with the second lockdown, and then nothing will be available, because no one's ever going to go back to work, because they'll have no confidence.
[00:38:21.024 --> 00:38:22.285]  And now they're getting ready for all of that.
[00:38:22.445 --> 00:38:24.966]  And so we got limited products in right now.
[00:38:25.286 --> 00:38:27.047]  And when it's done, it's done probably.
[00:38:27.367 --> 00:38:32.589]  That's what I'm telling you is this is an end game where they're just going to bankrupt everybody where you won't be able to operate regardless.
[00:38:32.769 --> 00:38:37.171]  And they'll do cyber attacks that shut down things for a few months to totally break your will and break your back.
[00:38:37.191 --> 00:38:40.113]  And I'm not glad it's happening, but this is warfare and they're doing it.
[00:38:41.033 --> 00:38:43.274]  So we'll operate as long as we can.
[00:38:43.294 --> 00:38:45.615]  We need to get as much capital in as we can now.
[00:38:46.075 --> 00:38:47.476]  We got product in stock.
[00:38:47.656 --> 00:38:48.796]  What we've got is what we've got.
[00:38:49.057 --> 00:38:49.657]  You need to get it.
[00:38:50.799 --> 00:38:59.143]  Survival Shield X2, the Deep Earth Crystal Iodine, the purest type for your body, your stamina, your veto, your image, your immune system, everything.
[00:38:59.763 --> 00:39:04.565]  Your skin, it is 40% off, don't know if we'll ever have it in stock again.
[00:39:05.526 --> 00:39:08.887]  Got a small shipment, 20% of what we wanted to put in.
[00:39:08.907 --> 00:39:14.990]  They said, well, you take this, it's all we can get at the standards you want, highest quality, vitamin D3 and vitamin K for your immune system, under the tongue.
[00:39:15.210 --> 00:39:17.231]  We got a shipment of a couple thousand bottles of it in.
[00:39:19.352 --> 00:39:20.433]  Out of sell, we got to sell.
[00:39:20.493 --> 00:39:22.394]  At the price we got it, 50% off.
[00:39:23.055 --> 00:39:27.999]  Green fiber, $19.95 from high quality fiber from wheat sprouts and other sprouts.
[00:39:28.319 --> 00:39:32.442]  So it's incredible fiber with all the amino acids and more, and a whole bunch of vitamins and minerals.
[00:39:32.882 --> 00:39:33.023]  It's $19.95.
[00:39:34.183 --> 00:39:36.625]  Down and out, great natural sleep aid along with...
[00:39:37.626 --> 00:39:39.269]  It's not as strong, but it's still excellent as well.
[00:39:39.729 --> 00:39:40.190]  Knockout.
[00:39:40.991 --> 00:39:41.752]  It's in pill form.
[00:39:42.113 --> 00:39:42.834]  Down-and-outs liquid.
[00:39:42.874 --> 00:39:45.498]  Those are both 50% off, back in stock.
[00:39:46.099 --> 00:39:49.564]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:39:49.664 --> 00:39:52.789]  And separately, I said, I want the best deal you've got.
[00:39:53.610 --> 00:39:55.671]  Because some of his partners are great people, but I get it.
[00:39:55.771 --> 00:39:57.171]  They don't want a small percent.
[00:39:57.431 --> 00:40:00.232]  They want to sell stuff for a little bit higher price so they get a bigger piece of it.
[00:40:00.513 --> 00:40:01.273]  That's fine and dandy.
[00:40:01.893 --> 00:40:02.673]  Overhead shot, please.
[00:40:03.034 --> 00:40:07.975]  When you go to his website, you'll notice all these different banners for different talk show hosts and people for the special deals they have.
[00:40:08.456 --> 00:40:11.277]  Well, it's the Radio Listener Special that's the Alex Jones Special.
[00:40:11.597 --> 00:40:14.838]  That's the best deal across the board, up to 66% off.
[00:40:15.098 --> 00:40:16.238]  Soon my picture will be up there.
[00:40:16.258 --> 00:40:17.439]  It'll be Alex Jones Best Deals.
[00:40:17.779 --> 00:40:19.420]  I'm sure the other people don't really want that, but that's okay.
[00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:20.100]  I'm not starting a fight.
[00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:45.225]  It's there, all the deals are great, but I have the best deals you're going to get with promo code Alex, because obviously I want you to get the best deal out there on amazing sheets, on incredible towels and hand towels and everything, on beds for adults, for children, for animals, for dogs, for cats, and they've got the sheets, and they've got of course the pillows, all there, MyPillow.com, MyPillow.com, MyPillow.com.
[00:40:46.121 --> 00:40:47.341]  Promo code Alex.
[00:40:47.842 --> 00:40:48.782]  Promo code Alex.
[00:40:49.202 --> 00:40:51.783]  And let me just tell you about a few other things here.
[00:40:52.163 --> 00:40:53.003]  You can also call 800-675-4614.
[00:40:53.023 --> 00:40:55.744]  800-675-4614 specifically to get the Alex Jones deals.
[00:40:55.764 --> 00:40:57.545]  And it's just true!
[00:40:57.565 --> 00:40:58.325]  They are the best!
[00:41:08.902 --> 00:41:15.106]  Because I understand if you're another talk show host making a deal and you want to have a bigger percentage for yourself, that's fine.
[00:41:15.206 --> 00:41:17.207]  I'd rather have the best deal and sell even more.
[00:41:17.848 --> 00:41:30.616]  Go to mypillow.com forward slash, they should create a forward slash Alex, they don't have it yet, but mypillow.com, mypillow.com and put in promo code A-L-E-X or 800.
[00:41:34.059 --> 00:41:34.719]  675-4614.
[00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:41.405]  That is the number for Alex Jones listeners when you go into their great system of folks up in Minnesota.
[00:41:41.845 --> 00:41:43.126]  And that's how you fund our operation.
[00:41:43.166 --> 00:41:46.469]  He's selling record numbers of products thanks to you.
[00:41:46.869 --> 00:41:47.890]  But we have a smaller profit.
[00:41:47.930 --> 00:41:50.612]  That's okay because in the end it's a 360 win.
[00:41:51.032 --> 00:41:55.536]  But please fund us because I need to get as much money as we can into the future because they're about to shut everything down.
[00:41:55.816 --> 00:41:57.777]  We are under total attack, total war.
[00:41:57.997 --> 00:42:01.079]  We're holding out as long as we can, putting out the emergency transmissions.
[00:42:01.459 --> 00:42:02.040]  God help us.
[00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:02.980]  We'll be right back.
[00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:04.681]  Stay with us into hour number two.
[00:42:04.701 --> 00:42:11.346]  All right, I'm going to plunge into all the news and control myself next segment, but I'm teleprompter free.
[00:42:12.246 --> 00:42:13.167]  I'm manager free.
[00:42:13.187 --> 00:42:14.988]  I am publicist free.
[00:42:15.248 --> 00:42:16.669]  I am running the show here.
[00:42:17.529 --> 00:42:22.993]  My friends, there are supply chain breakdowns happening all over the world.
[00:42:24.096 --> 00:42:29.199]  And when I try to get products in, like our charcoal toothpaste that was a bestseller, it's been almost a year.
[00:42:29.739 --> 00:42:34.942]  We can't get it in because the products and the things that are in it can't be sourced, if they're organic and high quality.
[00:42:34.962 --> 00:42:38.764]  If I want to buy something from China, it's absolutely open for business, they're ready to ship.
[00:42:39.384 --> 00:42:42.186]  So that's an example of what we're up against and why it's so hard.
[00:42:42.786 --> 00:42:49.950]  We have a limited supply of Survival Shield X2, the Deep Earth Crystal Ionine, the opposite of the bad halogen fluoride and chlorine and bromide.
[00:42:49.970 --> 00:42:53.052]  We have a limited supply of it, 50% off at infowarestore.com.
[00:42:54.138 --> 00:43:01.688]  We also have Winter Sun, highest quality vitamin D3 and vitamin K. Take it under your tongue for your immune system and your body.
[00:43:02.941 --> 00:43:03.502]  It's essential.
[00:43:03.922 --> 00:43:04.843]  It's 50% off.
[00:43:05.143 --> 00:43:07.965]  That sale's going to have to end by, I'd say, early next week.
[00:43:08.305 --> 00:43:09.767]  We only have a few thousand bottles of it.
[00:43:10.067 --> 00:43:13.289]  And then we don't know when more is coming in, because the supply chain is breaking down.
[00:43:13.349 --> 00:43:20.235]  I've got newscasts all over the U.S., all over the world, all over Africa, all over Asia, all over Europe, all over England, where the store shelves are empty!
[00:43:20.715 --> 00:43:31.104]  Because the supply chain has broken down because the globalists bought up all the companies, they bankrupted most of the others, they got rid of most of the middle class things, and
[00:43:32.133 --> 00:43:37.502]  If one person, quote, test positive for COVID, even asymptomatic, they shut down trucking companies, they shut down warehouses.
[00:43:37.623 --> 00:43:38.424]  It's a war.
[00:43:38.725 --> 00:43:40.127]  It's chicken little hysteria.
[00:43:41.149 --> 00:43:44.414]  And through those collapses, they can then buy up the companies even cheaper.
[00:43:45.697 --> 00:43:46.818]  So we're under economic warfare.
[00:43:46.838 --> 00:43:49.921]  But I'll tell you who's got five-star ratings when it comes to customer service.
[00:43:50.161 --> 00:44:01.592]  I'll tell you who built his network and infrastructure and has thousands of employees here in the United States and sources materials all over North America and from Africa as well, which he's proud of.
[00:44:01.632 --> 00:44:04.995]  That's where you get the good cotton and then they put it together here in the United States.
[00:44:05.496 --> 00:44:06.036]  And that is
[00:44:07.082 --> 00:44:07.682]  Mike Lindell.
[00:44:08.483 --> 00:44:09.884]  Mike Lindell is a patriot.
[00:44:09.924 --> 00:44:11.304]  Mike Lindell is fighting.
[00:44:11.625 --> 00:44:16.887]  He is bold, and he's got his products in stock, ready to ship to you.
[00:44:17.268 --> 00:44:22.751]  When you use promo code ALEX, you get the best specials they've got.
[00:44:22.771 --> 00:44:23.991]  I want to show TV viewers this.
[00:44:24.311 --> 00:44:25.412]  There's a lot of different specials.
[00:44:25.432 --> 00:44:26.533]  When you partner with them, you can do.
[00:44:27.668 --> 00:44:30.749]  And some people are going to want to sell up at his regular price or close to it.
[00:44:31.289 --> 00:44:34.871]  It's still a great deal because they get a bigger piece of the pie.
[00:44:35.071 --> 00:44:38.152]  I'd rather sell for less and sell a lot more.
[00:44:38.192 --> 00:44:39.433]  That's just how my brain operates.
[00:44:39.593 --> 00:44:40.613]  It's not some marketing thing.
[00:44:40.633 --> 00:44:41.333]  It's just who I am.
[00:44:42.654 --> 00:44:53.178]  Whether it's their entire line of sheets or human beds that are revolutionary and very, very popular or animal beds for dogs and cats or the great towels or the pillows that they're best known for.
[00:44:54.642 --> 00:44:57.204]  It's all there at the radio listener specials.
[00:44:57.304 --> 00:44:59.386]  Those are the best specials.
[00:44:59.426 --> 00:45:05.891]  He tells me if I want to go for volume instead of individually making more on each sale for the percentage he pays us.
[00:45:06.972 --> 00:45:07.673]  And he's done great.
[00:45:07.693 --> 00:45:08.393]  His people are great.
[00:45:08.433 --> 00:45:11.396]  They've really come through and taken us out of the red into the black.
[00:45:11.436 --> 00:45:16.420]  So thank you all for shopping at MyPillow.com up to 66% off with promo code Alex.
[00:45:18.181 --> 00:45:20.243]  Again, I'm not bashing these other people.
[00:45:21.570 --> 00:45:24.512]  I'm not bashing all the other talk show hosts and people that have chosen their deals.
[00:45:24.852 --> 00:45:25.953]  Some of their deals are as good.
[00:45:26.233 --> 00:45:30.676]  But overall, the best deals together is the radio listener specials.
[00:45:30.776 --> 00:45:31.417]  It doesn't matter though.
[00:45:31.657 --> 00:45:35.019]  At checkout, you put Alex in and whatever the best deal is, it gives it to you.
[00:45:35.039 --> 00:45:36.280]  I'm going to explain that again.
[00:45:36.901 --> 00:45:44.406]  I could go and sell at his regular retail price twice as much and then make twice as much
[00:45:45.638 --> 00:45:46.098]  Each sale.
[00:45:46.358 --> 00:45:46.939]  I don't want that.
[00:45:47.819 --> 00:45:54.023]  I want the lowest price on the high-quality products, and I believe we'll sell a lot more than everybody else, which we've now done.
[00:45:54.543 --> 00:45:55.244]  So, that's great.
[00:45:55.304 --> 00:46:02.688]  We're selling a ton of his great products, making a lot less per item, but overall bringing in more to fund our operation, and it's a godsend.
[00:46:02.708 --> 00:46:05.129]  So, thank you all for shopping at MyPillow.com.
[00:46:05.489 --> 00:46:10.512]  Promo code ALEX, and there's also a toll-free number that I want to give you, 800-675-4614.
[00:46:10.612 --> 00:46:12.513]  That's the exclusive line for us.
[00:46:16.022 --> 00:46:18.763]  One last breath, the forewind blows.
[00:46:19.124 --> 00:46:20.564]  Better raise your ears.
[00:46:21.125 --> 00:46:23.706]  The sound of hooves are at your door.
[00:46:25.567 --> 00:46:27.488]  Lock up your wife and children now!
[00:46:33.791 --> 00:46:34.991]  Horsemen are here!
[00:46:35.011 --> 00:46:37.733]  They're here now.
[00:46:39.213 --> 00:46:40.514]  And they come to take your life.
[00:46:42.708 --> 00:46:45.411]  Coming up next segment, I'm going to give you the biggest story yet that's breaking.
[00:46:46.132 --> 00:46:47.993]  Massive internet outages around the world.
[00:46:48.634 --> 00:46:49.435]  Who stands to gain?
[00:46:49.455 --> 00:46:50.436]  Who has a history of doing it?
[00:46:50.736 --> 00:46:51.777]  Who is the terrorist?
[00:46:52.438 --> 00:46:53.860]  Klaus Schwab, that's coming up.
[00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:55.181]  Again, I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:46:56.162 --> 00:47:02.128]  And wow, Biden's off the rails behavior last night at a new level.
[00:47:02.168 --> 00:47:03.049]  What's really behind that?
[00:47:03.449 --> 00:47:04.370]  I'm going to break that down.
[00:47:05.575 --> 00:47:10.817]  Top medical scientists coming out saying the majority of people that take these so-called shots are going to have heart problems.
[00:47:11.258 --> 00:47:18.161]  The majority, 80-plus percent of people that have taken the Moderna or Pfizer shots are now showing blood clots, and these blood clots keep growing.
[00:47:19.021 --> 00:47:20.642]  You ask, why would they do something like this?
[00:47:20.742 --> 00:47:21.562]  It's an assault!
[00:47:22.062 --> 00:47:23.423]  We tried to gather the New World Order.
[00:47:23.463 --> 00:47:24.524]  We said no to the globalists.
[00:47:24.564 --> 00:47:25.864]  They came after us.
[00:47:27.065 --> 00:47:31.507]  But a lot of people online have seen these videos going viral.
[00:47:32.691 --> 00:47:33.414]  There's a lot of them.
[00:47:34.056 --> 00:47:37.388]  Watch Alex Jones predict lockdowns for manufactured virus pandemic 2018.
[00:47:40.148 --> 00:47:41.609]  This had five, six million views.
[00:47:41.649 --> 00:47:44.591]  They took it off Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, you name it.
[00:47:44.632 --> 00:47:45.452]  It's been re-uploaded.
[00:47:45.472 --> 00:47:48.715]  Last time I checked it, I was like, you know, one video has like 700,000 views.
[00:47:49.335 --> 00:47:53.919]  And they're whack-a-moling, not disinfo about the current rollout, but the warning.
[00:47:54.299 --> 00:47:59.964]  So how are you giving out disinfo about COVID-19 before COVID-19 was released from that laboratory?
[00:48:00.624 --> 00:48:04.307]  Remember, you weren't even supposed to say it was released from the laboratory before, but now you're allowed to say that.
[00:48:04.327 --> 00:48:08.971]  I mean, this is just a cult of control freaks seeing what they can do and assaulting us.
[00:48:09.915 --> 00:48:14.482]  So Darren put together a compilation, Alex Jones, what, from 1998?
[00:48:16.656 --> 00:48:17.537]  Right through into 2020.
[00:48:17.657 --> 00:48:18.958]  It's like an 8-minute clip.
[00:48:18.978 --> 00:48:20.879]  I'm not going to have time to play the whole thing.
[00:48:21.479 --> 00:48:25.062]  But a lot of folks said, hey, we don't want to see a bunch of fancy articles and graphics over you.
[00:48:25.422 --> 00:48:26.483]  We think this is fake.
[00:48:26.623 --> 00:48:27.703]  We think you read a script.
[00:48:28.064 --> 00:48:29.104]  We think you didn't say this.
[00:48:29.144 --> 00:48:31.226]  That's why they also said they took it off Twitter.
[00:48:31.246 --> 00:48:32.006]  They said, this is fake.
[00:48:32.286 --> 00:48:32.927]  He didn't really do this.
[00:48:33.207 --> 00:48:34.008]  Well, of course I did it.
[00:48:34.828 --> 00:48:35.449]  It's all right there.
[00:48:35.469 --> 00:48:36.489]  It's an Operation Lockstep.
[00:48:36.890 --> 00:48:38.911]  OK, so they don't want this scene.
[00:48:39.191 --> 00:48:40.232]  So here's some of the raw footage.
[00:48:41.374 --> 00:48:43.176]  Biological and chemical attacks are imminent.
[00:48:43.556 --> 00:48:44.577]  They are preparing us.
[00:48:44.637 --> 00:48:56.727]  They are going to create a crisis because they know that they can't deal with a real political backlash and the restructuring and the reforming and getting back to the Bill of Rights and the Constitution.
[00:48:58.909 --> 00:48:59.329]  Imminent!
[00:48:59.530 --> 00:48:59.730]  It's 1998.
[00:49:00.030 --> 00:49:00.470]  Imminent!
[00:49:00.690 --> 00:49:01.491]  It's going to happen.
[00:49:01.511 --> 00:49:03.332]  It's not a question of if, but when.
[00:49:03.553 --> 00:49:07.155]  There's going to be a chemical or biological attack on the American people.
[00:49:07.376 --> 00:49:09.017]  And what is their solution, they say?
[00:49:09.397 --> 00:49:10.438]  Give up our rights.
[00:49:10.558 --> 00:49:11.639]  Submit to Big Brother.
[00:49:11.979 --> 00:49:26.370]  The same thing Hitler did in 1933 when he said, the Jews, the blah blah blahs, they're gonna blow something up if I don't take full command and round people up and suspend and set up checkpoints and issue licenses and papers.
[00:49:26.771 --> 00:49:33.284]  During the Model States Health Emergency Powers Act, remember 2002, they wanted to have forced inoculation nationwide for smallpox?
[00:49:33.745 --> 00:49:36.731]  And it came out in news articles that, oh yeah!
[00:49:37.614 --> 00:49:52.319]  The feds are going to use sports stadiums and postal offices as the centers where if you refuse to be inoculated you'll be taken and be held but will also forcibly inoculate if we're given the orders at these injection facilities.
[00:49:52.339 --> 00:49:59.581]  I mean I'm not even worthy to be bringing you information this powerful and I hope that you pay attention to what we cover here minute by minute.
[00:50:01.775 --> 00:50:04.597]  Because I've had chills since last night.
[00:50:05.197 --> 00:50:07.999]  This just confirms everything else we've already researched.
[00:50:10.621 --> 00:50:22.870]  But Rockefeller study envisions future dictatorship controlled by elite, millions being killed, mandatory quarantines, checkpoints, the end of the family, everything that's in the other documents.
[00:50:22.930 --> 00:50:30.495]  But this dovetails with all the other Rockefeller Foundation documents about the GMO food to sterilize you and the forced vaccines.
[00:50:31.756 --> 00:50:38.258]  The hell we're already living in that's just going to continue to intensify until we take our governments back from these eugenics madmen.
[00:50:38.719 --> 00:50:41.980]  The question is, will you have the courage to really do the research yourself?
[00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:45.241]  Because I don't want you to just sit here and hear me make these claims.
[00:50:46.321 --> 00:50:58.286]  These people are so arrogant that they write policy papers, so many of them, that they're producing these policy papers and reports and white papers so fast that you could never read them all.
[00:50:59.275 --> 00:51:16.299]  I pray to God, I pray to my Heavenly Father Jesus Christ every night to give me the strength and the will to be able to face this horror and to give me the strength to carry on because I know why a lot of you don't want to look at this information and just want to comment on the YouTube videos or on message boards that I'm a liar.
[00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:17.680]  I know why.
[00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:19.260]  Because it's scary.
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:21.921]  You're not going to be able to go to the ballgames anymore.
[00:51:23.117 --> 00:51:25.438]  You're not going to be able to just go out and get drunk with your friends.
[00:51:25.458 --> 00:51:29.180]  You're not going to be able to just, you know, go out and enjoy yourself all the time.
[00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:34.603]  Once you face this information, once you've consciously admitted it to yourself, it will take over your life.
[00:51:35.003 --> 00:51:36.384]  It should take over your life.
[00:51:38.325 --> 00:51:39.105]  I mean, what else?
[00:51:39.746 --> 00:51:40.666]  What else could it do?
[00:51:42.087 --> 00:51:51.732]  The only chance we've got of beating this scientific dictatorship, this creeping death that takes its time to incrementally enslave you,
[00:51:52.879 --> 00:51:55.221]  Mentally, psychologically, physically, spiritually.
[00:51:56.021 --> 00:52:07.950]  The only way to defeat it is for the rank and file of this planet to realize that you have a choice to make on what your destiny is going to be.
[00:52:08.491 --> 00:52:12.114]  Win, lose, or draw, you need to choose a side.
[00:52:12.234 --> 00:52:17.758]  You need to spend some time this afternoon, this evening, over the weekend,
[00:52:22.267 --> 00:52:36.597]  To close the shutters, to sit there in your easy chair, and to just sit back and think about the claims I've made here, and decide on whether or not you're going to research the information we've laid out.
[00:52:37.377 --> 00:52:45.843]  In its 1968 yearly report, the Rockefeller Foundation acknowledged funding the development of so-called anti-fertility vaccines and the implementation of mass scale.
[00:52:46.504 --> 00:52:49.386]  From page 51 onward we read, and remember,
[00:52:50.986 --> 00:52:54.808]  One of Bill Gates' uncles, Bill Gates' dad, headed up Planned Parenthood.
[00:52:54.828 --> 00:52:56.049]  They work for the Rockefellers.
[00:52:56.089 --> 00:52:57.029]  We've confirmed that.
[00:52:59.690 --> 00:53:12.877]  And this $100-plus billion that these 40 billionaires have put in, $38 billion from the Gateses, $38 billion from Buffett, some more billions added by these other billionaires, the Rockefeller Foundation is running this.
[00:53:12.937 --> 00:53:19.300]  And remember the Times of London headline, Billionaires Meet in Secret to Plan Population Control.
[00:53:20.134 --> 00:53:21.195]  Population reduction.
[00:53:23.175 --> 00:53:26.277]  And at the end of the article, it talks about a world government to carry this out.
[00:53:26.617 --> 00:53:28.618]  What does eco-science cover?
[00:53:31.019 --> 00:53:37.282]  And it says, several types of drugs are known to diminish male fertility, but those have been tested have serious problems with toxicity.
[00:53:37.782 --> 00:53:44.085]  Yeah, Bisfenol A. Rockefeller Foundation developed vaccines for mass-scale fertility reduction.
[00:53:45.106 --> 00:53:46.066]  Don't say you weren't warned.
[00:53:48.988 --> 00:54:00.332]  They go on to say, using vaccines to reduce male fertility was something that needed to be investigated further, according to Rockefeller Foundation, because both the oral pill and the IUD were not sustainable for mass-scale distribution.
[00:54:02.052 --> 00:54:03.513]  And, of course, they want to do it by stealth.
[00:54:04.293 --> 00:54:05.293]  Oh, get your flu shot.
[00:54:06.073 --> 00:54:06.113]  Oh!
[00:54:06.814 --> 00:54:08.594]  You know, half of you'll never have kids.
[00:54:08.614 --> 00:54:09.775]  The other half shall have reduced.
[00:54:10.135 --> 00:54:11.215]  See, it's got to be soft kill.
[00:54:11.235 --> 00:54:13.736]  It can't hit everybody or be too noticeable.
[00:54:15.247 --> 00:54:17.148]  But they're testing how much they can get away with right now.
[00:54:17.168 --> 00:54:19.389]  You know, they want to hit those babies in the womb.
[00:54:19.989 --> 00:54:24.091]  Kind of like the UN programs worldwide, where they only want to help the pregnant women.
[00:54:24.131 --> 00:54:30.413]  They come give them shots, and they all have miscarriages on the spot, and they send armed troops to enforce the injections.
[00:54:30.834 --> 00:54:32.434]  And that's what America's turning into as well.
[00:54:34.935 --> 00:54:36.136]  I mean, you can't ignore this.
[00:54:37.358 --> 00:54:56.103]  Northrop Grumman bragged in a press release that it was going to use its cyber security technology to innovate new systems, I'm paraphrasing obviously, but to innovate new systems to track the spread of infectious disease and to develop more aggressive inoculation or vaccination technologies.
[00:54:56.183 --> 00:55:05.065]  Well what they've said, I remember that coming out a few months ago, that they're going to come out with new tracking systems where you've got to have your shots to be able to go out and do anything.
[00:55:05.145 --> 00:55:11.849]  Well, I mean, they're preparing mass graves, they're preparing forced inoculations, they're preparing under InfraGard lockdowns, under clergy response teams.
[00:55:11.969 --> 00:55:14.330]  You see, everybody's a bunch of followers in this country.
[00:55:14.950 --> 00:55:16.231]  When are we gonna stand up?
[00:55:16.311 --> 00:55:17.732]  When are we gonna effect change?
[00:55:20.693 --> 00:55:24.896]  Alright, there's literally hundreds of hours of stuff like this that we're going through.
[00:55:24.936 --> 00:55:30.278]  People do like to see stuff that's said in the past, so this is not fake, it's not CG, we said it all.
[00:55:30.299 --> 00:55:32.200]  And it's not hard, we don't even get the credit.
[00:55:33.390 --> 00:55:34.090]  This is all real.
[00:55:34.270 --> 00:55:35.711]  I mean, the globalists want to murder you.
[00:55:36.311 --> 00:55:39.092]  And they've got the Pentagon and all the major defense contractors at the top.
[00:55:39.452 --> 00:55:41.113]  The new war will be against humanity.
[00:55:41.653 --> 00:55:42.713]  They are Skynet.
[00:55:42.873 --> 00:55:43.854]  They believe they're the machines.
[00:55:44.974 --> 00:55:45.974]  Satan runs Skynet.
[00:55:47.995 --> 00:55:49.976]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:55:51.687 --> 00:55:58.969]  And you know, we'd have a really entertaining show and be informative and important, but not as important if I just covered news like this.
[00:55:59.910 --> 00:56:03.331]  Biden just said he wants to ban handguns, not just semi-automatics.
[00:56:04.031 --> 00:56:04.451]  That's video.
[00:56:04.471 --> 00:56:07.092]  You can pull it up for yourself at Town Hall.
[00:56:07.632 --> 00:56:08.652]  They got the video right there.
[00:56:08.712 --> 00:56:10.673]  Biden just said he wants to ban handguns.
[00:56:10.693 --> 00:56:11.153]  Here's another one.
[00:56:11.733 --> 00:56:12.474]  Such BS.
[00:56:12.594 --> 00:56:16.975]  Liar Joe Biden tells CNN Town Hall Democrats never said defund the police.
[00:56:17.035 --> 00:56:17.475]  That's right.
[00:56:17.855 --> 00:56:19.976]  Hell, his own vice president funded the rioters.
[00:56:22.076 --> 00:56:25.958]  Joe Biden clarifies that he's not hiding people and sucking their blood.
[00:56:26.378 --> 00:56:28.079]  No, just sucking their future and aborting them.
[00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:29.920]  You're right, you're just killing kids.
[00:56:29.940 --> 00:56:30.841]  You're not sucking their blood.
[00:56:32.502 --> 00:56:38.565]  Sleepy Joe rambles about aliens and the man on the moon in a shocking fiasco.
[00:56:39.565 --> 00:56:49.551]  We can talk about that all day long, but that's a diversion from the world government, the Fortune 100, through the big banks,
[00:56:50.595 --> 00:57:00.563]  Has created quadrillions, thousands of trillions in fake money, and they look out at you owning your own house, you owning your own business, you having your own, and they don't want that.
[00:57:00.603 --> 00:57:05.687]  They want to get rid of the economy and consolidate control with all the money they've got.
[00:57:05.707 --> 00:57:08.269]  To do that, they've got to bankrupt you, so you've got to sell.
[00:57:10.170 --> 00:57:12.112]  It's the old thing of the bank trying to bankrupt the farmers.
[00:57:13.755 --> 00:57:15.015]  And you know, hoping that there's a drought.
[00:57:15.596 --> 00:57:17.056]  But imagine that on steroids.
[00:57:17.836 --> 00:57:19.537]  And then steroids again and again and again.
[00:57:19.857 --> 00:57:21.878]  Imagine that up to the power of infinity.
[00:57:22.458 --> 00:57:23.758]  And that's what they admit.
[00:57:24.999 --> 00:57:25.999]  You're non-essential.
[00:57:26.059 --> 00:57:27.139]  Your business, your life.
[00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:30.800]  And so what did Klaus Schwab say?
[00:57:30.820 --> 00:57:31.881]  In fact, guys, we have that clip.
[00:57:32.161 --> 00:57:33.341]  I was looking at that clip of Klaus Schwab.
[00:57:34.422 --> 00:57:35.342]  The one we played a few weeks ago.
[00:57:36.857 --> 00:57:37.257]  We have it.
[00:57:38.217 --> 00:57:48.880]  Here's Klaus Schwab, ladies and gentlemen, who really is a supervillain, who really is a terrorist, and here he is just a month ago, saying, oh, you think the lockdowns have been bad?
[00:57:49.781 --> 00:57:50.641]  No, my pretty.
[00:57:51.121 --> 00:57:52.661]  I need more of a Russian accent than a German.
[00:57:52.701 --> 00:57:53.782]  I need to get better with my German.
[00:57:55.242 --> 00:58:04.665]  It is now time for you to understand that you'll be taking microchips in World ID, and you are, should we say, in money, since you're
[00:58:06.004 --> 00:58:15.807]  And then he goes on to say, if you think it's been a problem with the COVID lockdown, which he later bragged was so good for the earth.
[00:58:16.187 --> 00:58:17.367]  Oh, it's so terrible.
[00:58:17.707 --> 00:58:19.508]  You don't like the COVID breakdown.
[00:58:19.888 --> 00:58:23.909]  Well, now try Cyber Collab!
[00:58:26.010 --> 00:58:33.072]  But don't worry, you put them globally in charge, have a world ID, and an Internet of Kill Switches, he'll protect you from their own attacks.
[00:58:39.210 --> 00:58:52.023]  Still, pay insufficient attention to the frightening scenario of a comprehensive cyber attack which would bring to a complete halt
[00:58:53.035 --> 00:59:00.237]  To the power supply, transportation, hospital services, our society as a whole.
[00:59:01.178 --> 00:59:09.861]  The COVID-19 crisis would be seen in this respect as a small disturbance in comparison
[00:59:11.138 --> 00:59:13.361]  To a major cyber attack.
[00:59:14.303 --> 00:59:23.697]  To use the COVID-19 crisis as a timely opportunity to reflect on the lessons of cyber.
[00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:31.574]  So use the COVID-19 crisis, which we instituted, to prepare for the cyber attack.
[00:59:31.754 --> 00:59:32.634]  Which is coming.
[00:59:33.035 --> 00:59:35.576]  We will be your boss, though, when it happens, huh?
[00:59:35.956 --> 00:59:37.357]  Yes, we get the power.
[00:59:37.417 --> 00:59:38.358]  You're not essential.
[00:59:38.838 --> 00:59:41.279]  Meanwhile, he writes books saying, oh, we need a great reset.
[00:59:41.299 --> 00:59:42.500]  Oh, we need to shut down the carbon.
[00:59:42.860 --> 00:59:44.261]  Oh, this is so great this happened.
[00:59:44.561 --> 00:59:49.004]  And then it's their very corporations and the UN that put out the fear and the hysteria and did the lockdown.
[00:59:49.204 --> 00:59:50.885]  They're the ones directing it publicly!
[00:59:51.645 --> 00:59:54.486]  And it's bemoaning the starvation.
[00:59:55.366 --> 01:00:00.267]  There's so much starvation around the world now that new lockdowns are needed.
[01:00:00.287 --> 01:00:03.948]  And I have trouble doing the Klaus Schwab accent.
[01:00:03.968 --> 01:00:05.808]  I have to work on my German accents.
[01:00:08.869 --> 01:00:09.749]  It's out of control.
[01:00:10.389 --> 01:00:11.250]  It's in your face.
[01:00:11.470 --> 01:00:12.370]  It's what's coming next.
[01:00:13.783 --> 01:00:16.465]  Really important article I'm going to get posted on InfoWars.com.
[01:00:16.505 --> 01:00:17.706]  It's from ZeroHedge.com.
[01:00:17.766 --> 01:00:22.831]  Klaus Schwab, the humanist versus Klaus Schwab, the terrorist.
[01:00:23.952 --> 01:00:25.453]  And they're terrorizing people.
[01:00:25.713 --> 01:00:28.776]  They call for more lockdowns to get rid of the middle class.
[01:00:28.996 --> 01:00:31.118]  He says everything happening is good.
[01:00:31.138 --> 01:00:38.684]  Oh, I am very afraid that you're not going to be liking what happens when the cyber attack happens.
[01:00:38.844 --> 01:00:40.206]  Oh, you think you'll bankrupt now?
[01:00:45.230 --> 01:00:53.978]  And the public just goes along with this, just bows down to this, and it's so obvious, but it doesn't even need to be obvious.
[01:00:54.038 --> 01:00:55.439]  They admit they're doing it.
[01:00:55.860 --> 01:00:57.141]  They admit they're running it.
[01:00:59.943 --> 01:01:03.566]  But people don't want to admit that these are predators, because it's too scary.
[01:01:03.607 --> 01:01:11.534]  It's, you know, oh, maybe a Muslim's a predator, or we're taught men are predators, or we're taught, you know, white people are really bad, but oh my gosh, Klaus Schwab,
[01:01:13.086 --> 01:01:15.647]  And Henry Kissinger, these are good people.
[01:01:15.687 --> 01:01:18.047]  So let me take you to this point now.
[01:01:18.067 --> 01:01:22.188]  Schwab has been saying, this is imminent.
[01:01:22.828 --> 01:01:25.929]  The cyber attack will end civilization as we know it.
[01:01:26.569 --> 01:01:28.690]  I'm so sorry for you, but it is good to end it.
[01:01:29.550 --> 01:01:36.152]  And then we've got, widespread outage disrupts major retail financial travel, NBC.
[01:01:41.232 --> 01:01:45.833]  Oracle Cloud Infrastructure website indicated that services were experiencing an ongoing issue.
[01:01:46.374 --> 01:01:49.095]  Though it was not immediately clear, the outage was related.
[01:01:49.115 --> 01:01:52.796]  And it goes on to all this other stuff that's down.
[01:01:53.136 --> 01:01:55.757]  In fact, guys, when this printed, like I said about an hour ago, it didn't print everything.
[01:01:56.077 --> 01:01:56.817]  Just reprint me that.
[01:01:56.837 --> 01:01:59.478]  That'd really be awesome.
[01:01:59.518 --> 01:01:59.898]  Thank you.
[01:02:00.918 --> 01:02:03.199]  And a lot of other major websites were down today.
[01:02:03.839 --> 01:02:05.520]  It appears as a widespread outage.
[01:02:06.596 --> 01:02:16.549]  Akamai Content Distribution Network, the CDN which helps data move around the internet, said on its website it's investigating an emerging issue with Edge DNS service.
[01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:21.381]  Company said it expects to provide an update on the services disruption around 1 p.m.
[01:02:21.761 --> 01:02:24.102]  And you know, this all by itself, you say, okay, what's going on?
[01:02:24.382 --> 01:02:34.085]  But they talk about using the viruses, using the migrant flows, and using the cyber outages for a great reset and forgive world debt.
[01:02:34.485 --> 01:02:41.087]  Soon your computer not work and soon all the money in the bank be no good.
[01:02:41.707 --> 01:02:50.149]  We reset and give you new ID on your phone, like your digital passport for health, and then you will be, by the way, given free money.
[01:02:51.021 --> 01:03:03.890]  We will try to retrieve your money, but we will have to pool all the homes and all the mortgages and all the money into a new system, and then it will revalue and you will be given extra money.
[01:03:04.590 --> 01:03:10.515]  But until you agree to the reset and the new currency, you will not have any money.
[01:03:12.156 --> 01:03:14.978]  And of course, you read the IMF World Bank documents from 2001 that leaked out.
[01:03:15.916 --> 01:03:17.136]  What is coming down the pipe?
[01:03:17.156 --> 01:03:17.976]  The cyber
[01:03:46.616 --> 01:03:47.136]  Pandemic.
[01:03:47.797 --> 01:03:54.380]  Big report up on Infowars.com from the vampire bat himself, Klaus Schwab.
[01:03:56.721 --> 01:03:58.282]  But Klaus Schwab is essential.
[01:03:58.582 --> 01:04:00.524]  You are not essential.
[01:04:01.244 --> 01:04:02.284]  Do you understand?
[01:04:03.025 --> 01:04:13.891]  There are major institutions, there are major governments, that are pre-prepared for economic collapse, who will consolidate control
[01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:26.287]  And become more powerful through the process of the engineered collapse that they themselves have engineered.
[01:04:28.388 --> 01:04:38.815]  And so just in the last 15 minutes, I was covering the globalists saying they're going to use cyber outages and attacks to maintain control and bring in their power.
[01:04:38.835 --> 01:04:42.117]  We've got major outages being reported across the United States.
[01:04:42.177 --> 01:04:44.859]  Well, now this is being reported.
[01:04:46.806 --> 01:04:56.755]  FedEx, UPS, Airbnb, and Delta Airlines websites all reporting outages as 9-1-1 lines down along the East Coast.
[01:04:58.737 --> 01:05:01.219]  Yeah, if you can't get rid of the police, just get rid of the 9-1-1, huh?
[01:05:01.700 --> 01:05:02.721]  This is economic warfare.
[01:05:03.101 --> 01:05:05.824]  Put a cryptkeeper up on TV who can't even talk.
[01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:10.440]  Demoralize everybody.
[01:05:10.460 --> 01:05:11.341]  That's how you take the country down.
[01:05:11.401 --> 01:05:12.221]  It's going quite well.
[01:05:12.641 --> 01:05:16.823]  And the average yuppie that signed on to all this actually knows it's a takedown of America.
[01:05:16.903 --> 01:05:18.804]  They believe they're all about to be put in charge.
[01:05:18.824 --> 01:05:19.524]  The average trendy.
[01:05:20.885 --> 01:05:22.085]  They're going to lose everything they've got.
[01:05:22.205 --> 01:05:23.666]  But that's why you call them useful idiots.
[01:05:26.567 --> 01:05:27.548]  Multiple major U.S.
[01:05:27.588 --> 01:05:33.210]  companies have been knocked offline today due to a nationwide outage including Airbnb, FedEx, Delta Airlines, and HBO Max.
[01:05:37.082 --> 01:05:49.811]  Down Detector also flagged issues with Fidelity, USAA, UPS, Home Depot, Southwest Airlines, Costco, Amazon's website, and around midday today.
[01:05:49.851 --> 01:05:50.512]  This is happening now.
[01:05:51.873 --> 01:06:04.903]  Agencies affected include Steam, Newegg, LastPass, Charles Schwab, Akamai, Discover, DraftKings, McDonald's, Expedia,
[01:06:05.984 --> 01:06:08.546]  Google, AP Morgan Chase, Groupon, it goes on.
[01:06:09.327 --> 01:06:14.130]  Olympic Games website reportedly intermittently down just hours before the opening ceremony.
[01:06:14.311 --> 01:06:19.374]  Thousands of other retail, financial, and travel websites battle technology problems.
[01:06:21.336 --> 01:06:26.680]  And again, who shut down the pipeline, the Keystone Pipeline, that cost $15 billion to build?
[01:06:28.141 --> 01:06:28.662]  The globalists.
[01:06:29.702 --> 01:06:32.345]  Who shot down and shut down the Colonial Pipeline?
[01:06:33.405 --> 01:06:33.986]  The globalists.
[01:06:37.418 --> 01:06:38.159]  Who did all this?
[01:06:38.419 --> 01:06:40.720]  They're the ones sabotaging!
[01:06:40.780 --> 01:06:42.301]  They're the ones opening the borders!
[01:06:42.321 --> 01:06:43.862]  They're the ones shipping in the fentanyl!
[01:06:43.902 --> 01:06:45.183]  They're the ones demoralizing!
[01:06:45.483 --> 01:06:47.065]  We're under attack!
[01:06:49.586 --> 01:06:54.129]  But we think because, oh, we're America, we're the superpower, we're completely sold out.
[01:06:57.211 --> 01:06:58.112]  By the way, I misspoke.
[01:06:58.132 --> 01:07:01.034]  We have a big medical doctor who I had on MIT, you name it.
[01:07:02.835 --> 01:07:03.676]  Hell, like a year ago.
[01:07:06.052 --> 01:07:09.414]  And he's going to join us next hour on the latest on COVID-19 and what's unfolding there.
[01:07:09.434 --> 01:07:10.455]  And then Tommy Robinson.
[01:07:11.335 --> 01:07:13.276]  You haven't heard from him in a year on air.
[01:07:13.296 --> 01:07:17.019]  I got a call from him at like 5 a.m.
[01:07:17.039 --> 01:07:18.880]  this morning, right as I was waking up.
[01:07:20.141 --> 01:07:23.583]  And he was in court today for his speech and attacked.
[01:07:24.763 --> 01:07:27.305]  And we went in and out of communication.
[01:07:27.325 --> 01:07:32.969]  We're going to get an update from him in the last 15 minutes of the next hour that Mike Adams has taken over in the
[01:07:35.950 --> 01:07:38.271]  Fourth hour today, obviously a lot of key information.
[01:07:39.171 --> 01:07:53.195]  But when I tell you that intellectually I'm upset about what's happening, and my spidey sense is off the charts right now, it's just, this is all an exercise in economic warfare to discredit the United States and bring us down.
[01:07:54.476 --> 01:07:56.196]  There it is, a big announcement by the FCC.
[01:07:56.856 --> 01:08:01.518]  FCC announces nationwide emergency alerting tests on August 11, 2021.
[01:08:04.633 --> 01:08:07.034]  Yeah, they're going to start doing force-coded transmissions.
[01:08:07.054 --> 01:08:08.075]  That's the internet kill switch.
[01:08:08.575 --> 01:08:11.997]  When they test that hardwired to all your TVs, all radio, all cell phones.
[01:08:13.377 --> 01:08:14.458]  And I've been telling you about this forever.
[01:08:14.478 --> 01:08:15.218]  This has been the plan.
[01:08:16.539 --> 01:08:17.559]  And now they're rolling it out.
[01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:24.783]  So, I'm really sorry folks, but nobody helped those babies getting chopped up in their mommies.
[01:08:24.863 --> 01:08:27.444]  So, we're going to get hurt real bad.
[01:08:27.504 --> 01:08:28.505]  I'm sorry everybody.
[01:08:29.821 --> 01:08:41.832]  I tried to stop it, I know you tried to stop it, but hey, at least we're on air still, by the grace of God and your support, and at least we've tried to build redundancy and backups under attack to try to get the word out.
[01:08:43.193 --> 01:08:50.960]  We've also got a lot of infrastructure behind the scenes to reach out to our radio and TV stations, the ones that are able to stay on the air in the future.
[01:08:52.922 --> 01:09:05.592]  And we'll be able to send them direct feeds from us and then under that type of situation, those local stations will be very special because they'll be able to then be information hubs into what we're facing.
[01:09:06.593 --> 01:09:14.179]  Like I said, I've really done my best to try to stop this.
[01:09:19.261 --> 01:09:22.642]  People always ask when there's a big war, like, why did the Soviets do this?
[01:09:22.682 --> 01:09:23.602]  Or why did Hitler do that?
[01:09:23.642 --> 01:09:24.563]  Or why did they attack?
[01:09:24.603 --> 01:09:25.563]  And it's just they want power.
[01:09:26.863 --> 01:09:28.924]  And you're like, but they're gonna lose in the end.
[01:09:29.364 --> 01:09:30.665]  Well, they better lose or we're all dead.
[01:09:31.425 --> 01:09:32.625]  Because they don't want to just conquer us.
[01:09:32.645 --> 01:09:36.486]  They want to poison us and dumb us down and then suck all the money out of us while we die.
[01:09:36.506 --> 01:09:40.048]  Or they sit around and laugh because they're the little white lab-coated scientists.
[01:09:40.068 --> 01:09:40.708]  They know best.
[01:09:41.008 --> 01:09:41.968]  They're smarter than us.
[01:09:41.988 --> 01:09:42.808]  You know, they're invincible.
[01:09:43.349 --> 01:09:45.389]  And I just want all of them to know you're not invincible.
[01:09:46.710 --> 01:09:47.670]  And even if you were able,
[01:09:49.701 --> 01:09:55.604]  You could slave all of humanity and disease us and mutate us and deform us and torture us for your own sick pleasure.
[01:09:55.964 --> 01:09:56.785]  You will face God.
[01:09:57.765 --> 01:10:02.528]  And all your talk about immortality and hiring an immersion machine is all a parlor trick.
[01:10:03.068 --> 01:10:03.848]  It's all sleight of hand.
[01:10:03.888 --> 01:10:04.609]  It's all a fraud.
[01:10:04.769 --> 01:10:05.829]  And I don't mind any of it.
[01:10:08.491 --> 01:10:16.415]  By the way, I don't ever tell this story almost every day where I go, Oh, you know, a big national talk show host just sent me this.
[01:10:18.157 --> 01:10:20.279]  It's not a cryptic name drop.
[01:10:20.339 --> 01:10:29.427]  It's like, I am so excited that all the big household names you can think of that are fighting tyranny now, other than Sean Hannity, he says, you know, take your shots.
[01:10:29.487 --> 01:10:38.354]  And I guess the government visiting Fox saying, well, the vaccine's got Hannity to go along, but you know, Hannity's a boy scout.
[01:10:38.374 --> 01:10:43.118]  He thinks he's playing it safe, but nothing against Hannity.
[01:10:43.138 --> 01:10:45.000]  He can, he can, he can do what he wants.
[01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:46.381]  He can, he can be on that side of history.
[01:10:47.782 --> 01:10:53.983]  I got sent this because I was on the phone two nights ago talking about these articles out of the UK.
[01:11:18.724 --> 01:11:27.147]  And then I was ferreting around trying to read the studies, and I'd forgotten to actually send this to the crew, but a little bird sent it to me.
[01:11:28.267 --> 01:11:29.067]  So we've got this.
[01:11:29.107 --> 01:11:30.788]  This is a pretty big deal right here.
[01:11:30.808 --> 01:11:34.109]  This is the actual British government documents.
[01:11:36.589 --> 01:11:39.190]  The National Health Service, the Public Health England.
[01:11:39.210 --> 01:11:41.391]  Can I get an overhead shot over here, please?
[01:11:41.451 --> 01:11:41.611]  Thanks.
[01:11:41.631 --> 01:11:43.171]  This is where I, right here.
[01:11:44.011 --> 01:11:44.271]  Thanks.
[01:11:45.072 --> 01:11:45.592]  And it says,
[01:11:47.478 --> 01:11:51.899]  SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and variants under investigation in England.
[01:11:52.219 --> 01:11:59.082]  And I told you a year and a half ago, their cover for it not working will be it's a variant, but it's all just made up crap off PCR tests.
[01:12:00.162 --> 01:12:07.044]  But they go and admit that 60 plus percent of the people getting COVID and even more the percentage of those dying have been vaccinated.
[01:12:07.504 --> 01:12:12.926]  So when you hear 99% of the people dying from COVID weren't vaccinated, that's like saying pigs fly.
[01:12:14.408 --> 01:12:16.889]  Uh, and the Easter Bunny's real and Santa Claus is real.
[01:12:16.949 --> 01:12:18.069]  It's not true.
[01:12:19.229 --> 01:12:21.010]  You can go read this whole technical briefing 15.
[01:12:21.130 --> 01:12:25.091]  It's already a month old from June 11th.
[01:12:26.831 --> 01:12:31.052]  And this is just them covering why it doesn't work and why the people taking the shots are dying of COVID.
[01:12:31.712 --> 01:12:33.073]  And of course, it's the vaccine killing them.
[01:12:34.233 --> 01:12:36.733]  Or the vaccine removing their immunity that now allows regular things to kill them.
[01:12:37.394 --> 01:12:43.215]  And then if they've got any viral material in their body of any virus, then say it is, uh,
[01:12:45.011 --> 01:12:45.631]  COVID-19.
[01:12:45.671 --> 01:12:49.353]  So there's one of the reports.
[01:12:50.773 --> 01:12:51.773]  And I mean, good luck reading these.
[01:12:51.813 --> 01:12:53.894]  I've tried to read these things, but it's all right there.
[01:12:56.415 --> 01:12:59.176]  So of course, they don't get you in a bear trap like this and let you out.
[01:12:59.216 --> 01:13:02.917]  They don't snap their teeth down on you and then go, oh, you took your shot.
[01:13:02.937 --> 01:13:03.598]  Things are back to normal.
[01:13:03.818 --> 01:13:04.778]  They're never back to normal.
[01:13:04.798 --> 01:13:05.418]  That's the trap.
[01:13:05.819 --> 01:13:06.779]  The average leftist goes,
[01:13:08.749 --> 01:13:11.190]  You know, it's you guys not taking the shots when the lockdown's coming back.
[01:13:11.870 --> 01:13:12.190]  Really?
[01:13:12.550 --> 01:13:12.830]  Really?
[01:13:12.870 --> 01:13:13.930]  You really believe that?
[01:13:14.310 --> 01:13:15.751]  Yes, you want to stay locked down, fool.
[01:13:18.131 --> 01:13:24.853]  All right, we've got a special guest, medical doctor, MIT trained, joining us next hour to get into COVID and a lot more.
[01:13:24.873 --> 01:13:33.775]  We've got other really informative doctors that have filed this lawsuit dealing with the real numbers of COVID deaths according to the real reporting systems.
[01:13:34.275 --> 01:13:35.615]  They're going to be joining us tomorrow.
[01:13:37.295 --> 01:13:40.877]  But I wanted to play a clip from an article on InfoWars.com by Don Salazar.
[01:13:41.177 --> 01:13:44.019]  It's a whole bunch of doctors in a online Zoom meeting.
[01:13:44.579 --> 01:13:51.483]  Warns of the threat that the majority of vaccinated patients could have permanent heart damage.
[01:13:52.723 --> 01:13:54.304]  Some may die within three years.
[01:13:54.324 --> 01:13:55.325]  Well, we already have death.
[01:13:55.365 --> 01:14:04.330]  We already have them admitting that it can cause lesions on the brain and strokes, and it can cause heart attacks.
[01:14:05.836 --> 01:14:08.926]  for the body to attack its own organs like the liver and the lungs.
[01:14:09.848 --> 01:14:12.416]  So here they are talking about this is Dr. Charles Hoff.
[01:14:13.427 --> 01:14:21.133]  So far I've got 62% positive elevated D-dimer, which means that the blood clots are not rare.
[01:14:21.413 --> 01:14:32.342]  That's what the so-called experts keep telling us, the clots are rare, the big ones are rare, but the small ones are clearly happening in the majority of people, 62%.
[01:14:33.583 --> 01:14:36.906]  Now, I'll tell you what the real concern with this is.
[01:14:38.234 --> 01:14:39.014]  Is that right?
[01:14:58.022 --> 01:15:03.806]  And they sort of discarded the information because they said there's no clinical evidence of clots.
[01:15:03.866 --> 01:15:10.051]  Well, the clinical reading is because they're microscopic and they're scattered, and so you're not going to see clinical evidence.
[01:15:10.611 --> 01:15:22.940]  But in fact, all of the frequent side effects of the shock, which are headache, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, could all be signs of cerebral thrombosis on a
[01:15:23.501 --> 01:15:25.504]  On a capillary level.
[01:15:25.524 --> 01:15:37.501]  I mean those literally, you could be having thousands and thousands of tiny, tiny little clots in your brain that won't show on a scan, but they will give you those exact symptoms.
[01:15:39.122 --> 01:15:46.966]  So the concern is I have now got six people in my medical practice that cannot exert themselves the way they used to be.
[01:15:47.026 --> 01:15:49.987]  What medically we call reduced effort tolerance.
[01:15:50.588 --> 01:15:57.571]  Six people who now get out of breath doing things that they could previously do without any problem.
[01:15:58.371 --> 01:16:01.433]  So I believe that these people locked up
[01:16:02.333 --> 01:16:06.555]  Thousands and thousands of capillaries in their lungs in these six people.
[01:16:06.855 --> 01:16:15.558]  So, I believe these people now have permanently damaged lungs because they have got, I mean, and that's why they get out of breath.
[01:16:15.778 --> 01:16:23.981]  I have one fellow that used to walk two miles to my office every week for a shot for his arthritis and he says after a quarter of a mile he's done.
[01:16:24.061 --> 01:16:27.683]  In other words, his effort tolerance is reduced to one-eighth of what it used to be.
[01:16:29.088 --> 01:16:35.449]  And what did Dr. Fauci fund in 2012 at the University of Texas Level 4 Bioweapons Research Facility at Galveston?
[01:16:37.430 --> 01:16:45.192]  Three different vaccines that were designed to have the body attack the spike protein, not the RNA of the virus.
[01:16:46.032 --> 01:16:50.033]  And they said at the end of the study, they said, do not make a human vaccine for this.
[01:16:50.413 --> 01:16:53.313]  Extreme caution, it killed most of the mice.
[01:16:54.914 --> 01:16:55.494]  That's one study.
[01:16:56.897 --> 01:17:03.201]  Funded by the NIH and by the National Infectious Disease Allergy Centers, all of them.
[01:17:03.641 --> 01:17:04.862]  Fauci's name's at the top of it.
[01:17:06.063 --> 01:17:07.624]  So Fauci didn't shoot in the dark with this.
[01:17:07.644 --> 01:17:21.433]  They didn't just accidentally make this at Wuhan and release it and scare us and then censor everybody so we couldn't talk about it and then roll it out and then, oh my god, the vaccine doesn't work so you need more shots and, oh, the vaccine lowers your immunity, oh, and the vaccine makes your body create blood clots.
[01:17:23.874 --> 01:17:24.515]  They did it.
[01:17:25.993 --> 01:17:29.637]  Look at that arrogant little murderer Fauci when he's in the Congress.
[01:17:31.338 --> 01:17:34.802]  Arrogantly just staring back because he was involved in the HIV attack.
[01:17:36.103 --> 01:17:39.367]  He was involved giving them AZT in Africa to kill everybody as a treatment.
[01:17:40.307 --> 01:17:42.490]  It's what he does, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:17:44.025 --> 01:18:06.613]  So you debate how bad the virus is all day and even if it's real and all the rest of it, but the vaccine they made to counter the protein that they souped that virus up with, the gain-of-function, the HIV delivery system, that's what it is, it's what the top scientists and Nobel Prize winners scanned the virus, but that's all a side issue.
[01:18:06.633 --> 01:18:09.835]  Yeah, we know the same amount of folks died roughly last year, died the year before.
[01:18:10.135 --> 01:18:10.675]  It was a hoax.
[01:18:12.005 --> 01:18:16.188]  Most people that died had the flu or pneumonia and they wouldn't give medical treatment and they died at home.
[01:18:17.049 --> 01:18:17.429]  That was it.
[01:18:19.450 --> 01:18:21.392]  You don't have your vitamin C and D, you'll die of any virus.
[01:18:23.153 --> 01:18:24.674]  But everybody keeps debating whether it's real or not.
[01:18:24.734 --> 01:18:25.875]  The damn vaccine's real!
[01:18:27.336 --> 01:18:30.638]  The fact that it teaches your body to attack protein itself and create blood clots, it's real.
[01:18:31.579 --> 01:18:32.419]  Whatever the hell's in it.
[01:18:35.361 --> 01:18:40.465]  And the head UK government facility that tested it said it gets rid of your immune system and I played that clip yesterday.
[01:18:41.886 --> 01:18:43.327]  And you go, why would they say it out in the open?
[01:18:43.607 --> 01:18:45.327]  Because they're normalizing it.
[01:18:45.927 --> 01:18:49.049]  They're like, yeah, we're gonna teach your three-year-old to get blowjobs, preschool.
[01:18:50.189 --> 01:18:51.950]  Yeah, we're gonna teach him they're really a girl, or a boy.
[01:18:52.510 --> 01:18:54.030]  Yeah, we're gonna teach a girl she's a boy.
[01:18:54.310 --> 01:18:56.191]  Yeah, we're gonna have her at 10, cut her breast off.
[01:18:56.571 --> 01:19:01.073]  Because we're Satanists, we're crazy people, and we're getting away with it, and you put up with it, so so what?
[01:19:03.013 --> 01:19:05.814]  Now we've got one of the first doctors to go public.
[01:19:07.035 --> 01:19:10.036]  Over a year, and now a half ago, Dr. Andrew Kaufman,
[01:19:13.226 --> 01:19:17.049]  From MIT and the University of South Carolina.
[01:19:17.069 --> 01:19:24.494]  And we're going to try to give him the floor to go over what's really happening and what's unfolded since he issued all these warnings.
[01:19:25.134 --> 01:19:27.676]  Follow us through the best to get him the floor coming up.
[01:19:27.756 --> 01:19:37.042]  And then we have Tommy Robinson joining us, who has been off the radar for a year.
[01:19:38.463 --> 01:19:40.064]  And I barely talked to him the last year.
[01:19:41.127 --> 01:19:42.528]  I knew I sent him money and equipment.
[01:19:43.348 --> 01:19:45.230]  He was going to make a documentary about grooming gangs.
[01:19:45.950 --> 01:19:46.851]  And he's still working on it.
[01:19:47.511 --> 01:19:48.412]  And then, boom.
[01:19:50.831 --> 01:19:57.893]  I see the trailer for his film, A Boom Bandit Video, and it's about that whole controversy that came out where they said that a Muslim kid was waterboarded.
[01:19:57.953 --> 01:19:58.673]  That's not true.
[01:19:58.693 --> 01:20:01.974]  And then he went and covered it and got demonized and attacked.
[01:20:02.794 --> 01:20:07.175]  And so he's made a film and I don't know if he's going to release it or who's going to release it.
[01:20:07.295 --> 01:20:12.856]  But I know that he was in court today and they supposedly said he can't release his film.
[01:20:12.876 --> 01:20:16.137]  So they're going to rule that he's liable.
[01:20:17.165 --> 01:20:21.808]  And then say he can't release his film with the witnesses and the video of what really happened.
[01:20:21.828 --> 01:20:25.411]  Because we all know Muslims have never done anything wrong in the history of the world.
[01:20:27.773 --> 01:20:28.914]  So he's going to be popping in.
[01:20:29.334 --> 01:20:34.558]  And then Mike Adams is going to be hosting 45 minutes of the 4th Hour, The Health Ranger.
[01:20:36.479 --> 01:20:41.943]  I can handle stress, but I've been telling you this for weeks.
[01:20:42.103 --> 01:20:43.124]  I was going to take off next week.
[01:20:44.577 --> 01:20:57.850]  And then, of course, where I'm going, it turns out, is wildfires here in the U.S., so I don't know how you can do that, but I need to just spend time with my children and disconnect from this and hide my cell phone because I understand this is stressful.
[01:20:57.870 --> 01:20:59.471]  Believe me, I wish none of this was true.
[01:20:59.491 --> 01:21:07.058]  We're going to go through this together, but it's really dawned on me just how bad it is, but realize this is all a test.
[01:21:07.987 --> 01:21:12.648]  And it's like Voight said, you know, when God touched his heart, this is supposed to be easy.
[01:21:12.668 --> 01:21:15.149]  This is a process we all got to go through together.
[01:21:17.030 --> 01:21:22.031]  But it's simply incredible how serious and real this is.
[01:21:22.051 --> 01:21:23.432]  I want to thank you all for keeping us on air.
[01:21:24.292 --> 01:21:26.613]  We have two specials that will end in the next week.
[01:21:27.193 --> 01:21:29.834]  We have Winter Sun, the highest quality vitamin D3.
[01:21:31.505 --> 01:21:34.729]  At 50% off, a small shipment of that got in, that'll be sold out I think in a week.
[01:21:35.170 --> 01:21:38.334]  At 50% off, so you want some winter sun to boost your immune system, it's always great.
[01:21:39.215 --> 01:21:47.124]  About as high end, I'm sure there might be something better, I don't know about it, but the highest end we can find of organic vitamin D3 and vitamin K taken out of the tongue, sublingually.
[01:21:47.765 --> 01:21:48.726]  It is 50% off.
[01:21:49.126 --> 01:21:51.427]  X2 in the dropper model is selling out.
[01:21:52.328 --> 01:21:54.649]  The spray model is back to regular price because it's about to sell out.
[01:21:54.669 --> 01:21:59.632]  But we're going to keep the X2 dropper model on sale until it does sell out.
[01:21:59.652 --> 01:22:02.174]  Unless it will probably get more in a few months.
[01:22:02.214 --> 01:22:05.116]  But it's for your libido, but mainly your immune system, your stamina.
[01:22:05.136 --> 01:22:05.776]  It's essential.
[01:22:06.196 --> 01:22:09.779]  And the globalists bet so much on hitting you with bad halogens that block
[01:22:10.379 --> 01:22:12.020]  The good halogen, iodine.
[01:22:12.280 --> 01:22:14.301]  There's one good halogen and a whole bunch of bad halogens.
[01:22:14.321 --> 01:22:18.202]  And if your body doesn't have the good halogen, it will use fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it.
[01:22:18.503 --> 01:22:20.463]  That's why they bomb you hard with that.
[01:22:21.084 --> 01:22:23.405]  We have the green fiber made up of the green shoots of the
[01:22:25.663 --> 01:22:29.446]  All the best types of shoots, so it has all the amino acids, a bunch of vitamins and minerals.
[01:22:29.466 --> 01:22:33.509]  It's really a high-end green fiber from the wheatgrass and so much more.
[01:22:33.909 --> 01:22:34.169]  That's $19.95.
[01:22:34.329 --> 01:22:37.051]  It's all at infowarestore.com.
[01:22:37.531 --> 01:22:44.496]  And it takes a lot of money to have your own satellite uplinks, your own shows, and your own lawyers, and your own infrastructure, and your own encoders, and all of it.
[01:22:44.516 --> 01:22:47.298]  But thanks to you, you kept us on air, and we really appreciate you.
[01:22:47.899 --> 01:22:50.260]  So I would just encourage everybody to go to infowarestore.com.
[01:22:51.221 --> 01:22:53.704]  Get their winter sun, their X2 while they still can.
[01:22:54.325 --> 01:22:56.607]  And we have a lot of great t-shirts and books and films as well.
[01:22:56.627 --> 01:23:00.852]  We have a new stickers too that go on your door saying no contact tracers.
[01:23:01.312 --> 01:23:04.355]  Guess I gotta stick that on my door because they say they're coming to our houses in Austin.
[01:23:04.716 --> 01:23:06.017]  We quote better comply with them.
[01:23:06.858 --> 01:23:09.840]  And of course, Bill Clinton's foundation runs it.
[01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:13.522]  And Google got the money to control it from our governor.
[01:23:14.042 --> 01:23:16.964]  All right, we'll be right back with our number three.
[01:23:17.084 --> 01:23:19.125]  Stay with us and please tell folks to tune in.
[01:23:19.425 --> 01:23:20.786]  You'll want to hear what this doctor has to say.
[01:23:22.754 --> 01:23:31.357]  All right, next segment we're joined by a very important guest who's been blowing the whistle since day one, Dr. Andrew Kaufman, about what's really happening with COVID, the vaccines, and all.
[01:23:31.377 --> 01:23:33.137]  I really appreciate him joining us.
[01:23:33.177 --> 01:23:34.138]  That's coming up next segment.
[01:23:34.798 --> 01:23:38.379]  But now the police in France, all over the country, have joined the demonstrators.
[01:23:38.399 --> 01:23:40.039]  This report's from five days ago.
[01:23:40.079 --> 01:23:43.420]  Now the police have joined them all over the country, saying no to forced inoculations.
[01:23:43.440 --> 01:23:44.141]  That's the good news.
[01:23:44.841 --> 01:23:46.802]  So here's what was happening just a few days ago.
[01:23:47.122 --> 01:23:47.982]  Now you know the new developments.
[01:23:53.817 --> 01:24:01.762]  Fragmented global architecture is not fit anymore for purpose in the 21st century.
[01:24:02.623 --> 01:24:06.405]  It's high time for a great reset.
[01:24:06.886 --> 01:24:23.557]  On August 1st, President Emmanuel Macron's France will require a COVID-19 health pass for anyone entering a restaurant or cafe, a shopping center, hospital or taking a long-distance train due to the fear-mongering surrounding the dreaded Delta variant.
[01:24:24.504 --> 01:24:27.346]  Vaccinations are really about individual freedom.
[01:24:27.766 --> 01:24:28.746]  Everyone can choose.
[01:24:28.886 --> 01:24:30.347]  That's not the theme here today.
[01:24:30.727 --> 01:24:35.530]  The theme is about the absence of freedom that is unfortunately continuing to grow in this country.
[01:24:35.930 --> 01:24:36.390]  That's it.
[01:24:36.510 --> 01:24:38.772]  They're taking away our freedoms little by little.
[01:24:39.232 --> 01:24:41.473]  Vaccinated or not, we are all together.
[01:24:41.633 --> 01:24:54.269]  Beginning July 21st, anyone over the age of 12 will also be required to show the pass to visit a movie theater, a museum, a live theater, a theme park, or cultural center.
[01:24:54.429 --> 01:25:00.056]  Macron's government also decided to make vaccines compulsory for all healthcare workers.
[01:25:00.396 --> 01:25:09.058]  We need to strive for having vaccination levels at near 100% across France, because that is the only way we will have a sound future.
[01:25:09.558 --> 01:25:26.343]  This is why, for those health carers working in hospitals, clinics, retirement homes, people working in disabled care facilities, anyone who works in a professional capacity or volunteer capacity, working with the elderly or the most fragile people at home, they will
[01:25:27.728 --> 01:25:30.369]  They will have to be vaccinated without waiting.
[01:25:31.489 --> 01:25:33.189]  It is compulsory for them.
[01:25:33.890 --> 01:25:40.511]  As of the 15th of September, checks will be carried out and fines and sanctions will be handed down for anyone who is not vaccinated.
[01:25:41.452 --> 01:25:49.774]  For all of those people who for the time being have had no dose of the vaccine, we have options available for you.
[01:25:50.214 --> 01:26:11.494]  Macron's big stick approach is slightly being walked back, but the penalties under the draconian law mean that people in France who enter a bar or a restaurant without a COVID pass face six months in jail, while business owners that fail to check their status face a one-year prison sentence and a 45,000 euro fine.
[01:26:13.075 --> 01:26:24.744]  Known officially as the EU Digital COVID Certificate, the pass shows whether a person has been vaccinated against COVID-19, tested negative, or recovered from COVID-19.
[01:26:24.984 --> 01:26:30.008]  Meanwhile, the Mockingbird Media continues to fuel the tyranny plaguing humanity.
[01:26:30.228 --> 01:26:32.170]  This Delta variant has me very concerned.
[01:26:32.510 --> 01:26:42.499]  As long as there are these clusters of people who have not been vaccinated, I mean, can the Delta variant or another variant eventually penetrate the protection we thought we had from the vaccine?
[01:26:43.039 --> 01:26:50.565]  As long as the virus is alive and proliferating, there is the possibility for mutations.
[01:26:50.666 --> 01:26:55.750]  Mutations that could potentially evade the immunity of the vaccines that we have.
[01:26:56.090 --> 01:27:01.575]  As protesters in the French provinces of Canada refuse semis hauling vaccines.
[01:27:02.236 --> 01:27:03.838]  News people please don't lie!
[01:27:04.398 --> 01:27:09.964]  So we're being asked about a vaccine truck proving that vaccines are important and yet if we're vaccinated...
[01:27:18.376 --> 01:27:33.388]  Back in France, the rioting and large-scale protests have already reached colossal proportions as the French people grapple with Macron's full-blown dictatorship, all in the name of the advancement of a new world order.
[01:27:33.949 --> 01:27:35.090]  John Bowne reporting.
[01:27:37.216 --> 01:27:45.699]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to go to break here in just about 30 seconds, and we are going to come back with our special guest, Dr. Andrew Kaufman.
[01:27:45.719 --> 01:27:53.541]  He's been one of the main people accurately raising the alarm in the last 16 months about what's unfolding, and so he's the expert.
[01:27:53.561 --> 01:27:57.002]  I want to give him the floor when we come back and really have him lay out
[01:27:57.827 --> 01:28:04.800]  Wherever he wants to start, the history of it, where he thinks it's going, the incredible authoritarian nature of this, and so much more.
[01:28:04.841 --> 01:28:09.409]  In my view and others' view, this violates the Nuremberg Code, all these attempts at forced injection.
[01:28:10.882 --> 01:28:14.124]  We got a bunch of big medical doctors joining us on the show tomorrow.
[01:28:14.624 --> 01:28:19.046]  And I've got a big stack of those guys that are going to be joining us.
[01:28:19.786 --> 01:28:20.987]  And I've got this report here.
[01:28:21.047 --> 01:28:29.551]  Former Pfizer BP destroys media hit piece, attacks his warnings about COVID injection and calls them a pack of lies.
[01:28:29.571 --> 01:28:36.075]  That's the former Pfizer vice president and chief science officer, Michael Guidon.
[01:28:36.815 --> 01:28:38.136]  And we're working to get him on the show.
[01:28:38.196 --> 01:28:50.366]  We have several big medical doctors on the broadcast tomorrow who have filed these lawsuits dealing with the numbers of dead in the VARS reporting system and other systems.
[01:28:50.426 --> 01:28:53.629]  So look for that to be coming out tomorrow.
[01:28:53.669 --> 01:28:54.830]  Here's that report right here.
[01:28:55.430 --> 01:28:55.790]  Shock!
[01:28:55.911 --> 01:29:00.314]  Doctor warns the majority of vaccinated patients could have permanent heart damage.
[01:29:00.534 --> 01:29:03.377]  Some may die within three years and there is a
[01:29:03.957 --> 01:29:06.038]  Lawsuit being filed over that again.
[01:29:06.498 --> 01:29:10.140]  Those guys are going to be joining us on the broadcast tomorrow.
[01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:12.821]  But right now we're going to Dr. Andrew Kaufman.
[01:29:12.841 --> 01:29:14.642]  He is a psychiatrist.
[01:29:15.162 --> 01:29:15.782]  He has a B.S.
[01:29:15.822 --> 01:29:17.483]  from MIT and an M.D.
[01:29:17.783 --> 01:29:19.624]  from Medical University of South Carolina.
[01:29:19.644 --> 01:29:23.846]  I'm not going to go over his whole background, all the books he's written and the things he's done.
[01:29:23.886 --> 01:29:27.668]  But from the very start, he has been criticizing
[01:29:29.110 --> 01:29:31.371]  This whole rollout and what has been unfolding.
[01:29:31.871 --> 01:29:38.194]  And so I've got so many questions for him, but the best way to do this is just thank you for coming on and then let him start where he thinks is best.
[01:29:38.234 --> 01:29:40.235]  So, Dr. Kaufman, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:29:41.396 --> 01:29:42.276]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[01:29:42.356 --> 01:29:47.639]  It's really a pleasure to be here and I appreciate the opportunity to speak to your audience.
[01:29:48.879 --> 01:29:49.680]  Where do you want to start?
[01:29:49.700 --> 01:29:51.901]  I'm going to try to give you the floor here to break this down.
[01:29:52.836 --> 01:29:54.217]  Well, I really appreciate that.
[01:29:54.277 --> 01:30:07.186]  And, you know, I like to start at the beginning because what happened is, you know, since the announcement of a pandemic in March of 2020, we have been experiencing a total change in the way our government handles things.
[01:30:07.806 --> 01:30:14.771]  And essentially what they've done is an end run around the legislative process and taken away many of our freedoms.
[01:30:14.851 --> 01:30:20.655]  And now, of course, they're putting a lot of pressure on us to take an experimental so-called vaccine.
[01:30:21.475 --> 01:30:32.180]  And so when this started occurring, I said, you know, I want to start at the root cause because really everything that has happened has been justified by the virus.
[01:30:32.841 --> 01:30:34.641]  So I thought I'd start at square one.
[01:30:34.681 --> 01:30:44.026]  And, you know, I come from a scientific and medical background, so I'm able to read the literature and understand what things are what.
[01:30:45.140 --> 01:30:51.524]  And so I started looking at the articles where they say that they've discovered a novel coronavirus.
[01:30:52.244 --> 01:31:00.750]  And what I uncovered is that they put forth this experimental criteria that proves the existence of a virus.
[01:31:00.810 --> 01:31:12.997]  But when you take a closer look, it's actually the experiment itself that gives them the proof they need, even if you don't even have any source of a virus in the experiment at all.
[01:31:13.852 --> 01:31:27.042]  And this was actually carried out recently by Dr. Stefan Lanke in Germany who showed that he got the same proof of a virus by doing the experiment without any source of a virus whatsoever.
[01:31:28.283 --> 01:31:42.713]  And so I learned that they've never actually taken a sick person and pulled a virus out of a sick person directly and got it by itself in a purified isolated form so that they could study it.
[01:31:43.522 --> 01:31:54.685]  Instead, what they've done is essentially use a computer to generate what they call an in silico genome, which is completely computer generated.
[01:31:55.206 --> 01:31:57.286]  And we know this by several ways.
[01:31:57.606 --> 01:32:07.489]  One, simply just looking at the experiments that they do, you can see that they don't start with an organism with one piece of genetic material.
[01:32:07.930 --> 01:32:11.051]  They start with a big mixture that they don't even know what's in it.
[01:32:11.731 --> 01:32:12.471]  But also,
[01:32:13.134 --> 01:32:27.400]  The alleged PCR diagnostic test, which is based on this genome sequence, was actually used before they even had shown the presence of this new virus in any way.
[01:32:27.460 --> 01:32:40.065]  In fact, it was made completely based on the published genome sequence from the SARS virus in 2003, which also, by the way, was an in silico genome.
[01:32:40.509 --> 01:33:05.377]  And then we've seen other evidence, for example, the pictures that we see allegedly showing this virus, now many of them are just artistic renderings created by a graphic artist and have nothing to do with reality, but the pictures that are from an electron microscope that are in black and white that show these round particles with the so-called spike dots on the outside,
[01:33:06.585 --> 01:33:19.441]  That those have actually been shown in regular kidney biopsies from as early as 1999, when those people had nothing to do with SARS-CoV-2 obviously or any virus.
[01:33:20.062 --> 01:33:23.967]  And in the literature, the scientists, the kidney doctors who wrote this paper,
[01:33:24.571 --> 01:33:32.376]  They said straight out, these particles are indistinguishable from what they call viruses, and this would be a point of confusion and should be paid attention to.
[01:33:33.076 --> 01:33:40.281]  And even in their article, they alluded to the CDC, which actually published another paper about this issue previously.
[01:33:40.361 --> 01:33:47.566]  And so all of the scientific community is somewhat aware of this confusion, but they never acknowledge it.
[01:33:47.606 --> 01:33:51.128]  And they just basically pretend that this virus is real.
[01:33:51.952 --> 01:34:10.382]  And why this is so important is because obviously if there is not an actual virus that's even been discovered to be real, then you can't have a genome, it can't cause a disease, it can't spread from person to person or do anything if it doesn't exist.
[01:34:11.022 --> 01:34:16.925]  And once you can understand this based on the evidence that is widely available and published,
[01:34:17.743 --> 01:34:28.807]  Then it's really easy to understand everything else that's going on, and of course, all the fears about your health being affected by this invisible boogeyman simply disappear.
[01:34:28.827 --> 01:34:44.952]  Alright, well I'm not a medical doctor of the human brain like you are, but I've interviewed psychiatrists, I've interviewed MDs, I've interviewed brain surgeons, I've interviewed virologists, epidemiologists, and we just see armies of them everywhere.
[01:34:45.552 --> 01:34:47.214]  Basically agreeing with what you're saying.
[01:34:47.234 --> 01:34:57.907]  You've been one of the first to come out, you know, early and talk about this, but most doctors, my family doctor thinks this is all staged and a fraud and it says this new so-called vaccine destroys your immune system.
[01:34:58.147 --> 01:35:00.770]  Then I've got all the British reports from their own government admitting it.
[01:35:01.691 --> 01:35:04.752]  And so this is very Orwellian for me.
[01:35:04.792 --> 01:35:17.697]  I've never felt so gaslighted as I do constant research, and then they just meet us with this wall of shut up, you're wrong, even though everything they say is not true, and then Fauci's perjuring himself, okay, did it come out of a lab?
[01:35:18.017 --> 01:35:19.198]  So my listeners are like, wait.
[01:35:20.058 --> 01:35:20.499]  Is it real?
[01:35:20.519 --> 01:35:21.680]  Did it come out of a lab, Jones?
[01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:23.441]  Or is it totally a fraud?
[01:35:23.881 --> 01:35:25.603]  Because the PCR test we know is a scam.
[01:35:25.643 --> 01:35:28.786]  And as you said, I've read the same reports where they admit they never isolated it.
[01:35:29.146 --> 01:35:33.770]  They used computers like Theranos did a few years ago to supposedly find cancer.
[01:35:33.810 --> 01:35:34.871]  We now know that was a fraud.
[01:35:35.391 --> 01:35:38.554]  So I really see parallels between Theranos and what's currently happening.
[01:35:38.574 --> 01:35:39.575]  Can you give us your take on that?
[01:35:40.632 --> 01:35:57.510]  Yeah, well, you know, you make an excellent point and this is really the reason why they're pushing so hard with the censorship right now because they don't want the voices of these doctors who realize the fraud and the scam that's going on to make those things public because they want everyone to just
[01:35:58.150 --> 01:35:58.250]  Yes.
[01:36:18.446 --> 01:36:18.927]  Thank you.
[01:36:48.768 --> 01:36:59.823]  But I'm still very impressed by the countless army of prestigious scientists, doctors, former chief scientists at Pfizer, the discoverer of HIV.
[01:36:59.843 --> 01:37:03.108]  I mean, all these people basically saying this is a giant fraud.
[01:37:03.549 --> 01:37:05.011]  When we come back, I want to
[01:37:05.391 --> 01:37:07.293]  Go back to the original numbers that woke you up.
[01:37:07.753 --> 01:37:12.718]  We'll talk about those, tell folks where to go look it up for themselves, and then ask you, you know, ask somebody that studies the brain.
[01:37:13.298 --> 01:37:15.440]  Obviously, they admit this is psychological warfare.
[01:37:15.460 --> 01:37:18.743]  The British government admits they're, quote, brainwashing the public with fear.
[01:37:19.263 --> 01:37:20.244]  How do we counter that?
[01:37:20.284 --> 01:37:28.011]  Because I've even got family that are smart people, have high IQs, who still just said, you know, shut up, take the shot, we'll never be free until we do it.
[01:37:28.031 --> 01:37:30.633]  Now they're saying, hey, taking the shot doesn't make us free.
[01:37:31.494 --> 01:37:34.163]  How do we get people out of a mass Stockholm Syndrome?
[01:37:34.464 --> 01:37:37.414]  I'm not the psychiatrist like you, but I'll ask you that question when we come back.
[01:37:37.475 --> 01:37:37.876]  Thank you, Doc.
[01:37:38.672 --> 01:37:43.177]  All right, Dr. Andrew Kaufman has been trained at MIT and the University of South Carolina.
[01:37:43.217 --> 01:37:46.340]  He's an author, researcher, but he's a psychiatrist.
[01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:50.484]  He went off the mainline science in Germany, in the U.S.
[01:37:51.425 --> 01:37:52.627]  I'm not a trained psychiatrist.
[01:37:52.667 --> 01:37:53.628]  I'm not a trained medical doctor.
[01:37:53.928 --> 01:37:54.609]  I've had them on.
[01:37:54.649 --> 01:37:55.309]  I've read this.
[01:37:55.930 --> 01:37:58.052]  All I know is everything Fauci says is a lie.
[01:37:58.333 --> 01:38:00.815]  He says 99% of the deaths are from the
[01:38:01.716 --> 01:38:02.336]  Unvaccinated.
[01:38:02.356 --> 01:38:03.337]  I go look at the British and U.S.
[01:38:03.377 --> 01:38:03.717]  reports.
[01:38:03.937 --> 01:38:04.617]  It's the opposite.
[01:38:05.897 --> 01:38:08.698]  They admit the PCR test is 94% false positive.
[01:38:09.018 --> 01:38:09.699]  New York Times.
[01:38:09.939 --> 01:38:11.759]  You question that, you get banned on Twitter.
[01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:14.260]  They're censoring congressional hearings.
[01:38:14.640 --> 01:38:17.201]  They're definitely covering up what's going on.
[01:38:17.281 --> 01:38:19.442]  Big Tech's in bed with Big Pharma.
[01:38:20.422 --> 01:38:28.888]  And he's one of the first prominent people to take the medical research that was out there and talk about it over a year ago and say this is a scam.
[01:38:28.908 --> 01:38:30.549]  They haven't even isolated the virus.
[01:38:30.849 --> 01:38:35.152]  They're using computers to claim that they find the material from it and then saying it exists.
[01:38:36.213 --> 01:38:36.633]  And so...
[01:38:37.774 --> 01:38:39.055]  That's my layman way of putting it.
[01:38:39.175 --> 01:38:45.677]  Then they say there's these new variants, so we've got to continue the lockdowns and the rest of it, but they never show evidence of that.
[01:38:45.717 --> 01:38:51.900]  And I guess that's really not your current... I mean, previously you were just pointing out the whole thing had issues.
[01:38:52.660 --> 01:39:01.964]  Now you're basically, unless I'm wrong, you're saying that the variant particularly is really something they have no proof of.
[01:39:02.225 --> 01:39:05.226]  So please quantify that for us, sir, in layman's terms.
[01:39:06.189 --> 01:39:07.230]  Yeah, I'd be happy to.
[01:39:07.330 --> 01:39:22.702]  So I described before that they sequenced this entire genome and they did this in a way where they had basically fragments of genetic material from whatever would be in someone's lungs who was sick, which would be a lot of different things.
[01:39:23.622 --> 01:39:29.467]  And there turns out that there's like 56 million individual little fragments of RNA
[01:39:30.140 --> 01:39:39.126]  And they sequence those and we don't know where any of those individual fragments are from because we didn't get it from a virus, right?
[01:39:39.166 --> 01:39:42.508]  And we don't even know that there is a virus because it wasn't even shown.
[01:39:43.048 --> 01:39:52.334]  So basically they put these fragments into a computer and the computer combines them into over 3 million possible genomes.
[01:39:52.910 --> 01:39:52.990]  Yes.
[01:40:08.664 --> 01:40:25.528]  Then what they do is they put out a set of instructions, like a recipe, of how anyone around the world can now do this experiment, except what they're going to do is, in the end, they're going to compare it to that index sequence, which is totally contrived by a computer.
[01:40:26.308 --> 01:40:33.630]  But since they're never going to get an exact match, right, because they're not actually testing a real thing,
[01:40:34.370 --> 01:40:34.570]  Right?
[01:40:34.610 --> 01:40:37.412]  They're just combining all these random sequences together.
[01:40:37.812 --> 01:40:49.460]  So every time they repeat the experiment by this recipe around the world, and there's been something like, I think someone said 40,000 of these that have been done, not one matches exactly.
[01:40:49.840 --> 01:40:51.361]  They all are a little bit off.
[01:40:51.401 --> 01:40:56.945]  And this is what happens when you try to repeat an experiment that's invalid, is that you don't get the same results.
[01:40:57.608 --> 01:41:09.775]  But of course all these different results they call variants and this is a very important scheme to not only continue the fear but to ramp it up and then use this to justify everything.
[01:41:09.815 --> 01:41:20.462]  But they haven't isolated and characterized any one variant at all and they've never done any studies even where they look at the actual clinical outcomes.
[01:41:21.042 --> 01:41:26.025]  Generally what they do is they do some kind of computer simulation that says this may be
[01:41:26.606 --> 01:41:39.807]  More transmissible and more dangerous but it's really probably you know just people sitting around and saying how can we make this scary and how can we fudge the science to make it look like it backs that up.
[01:41:40.481 --> 01:41:57.014]  So isn't this the ultimate Salem Witch Trial 2.0, where it's this nebulous thing you can't see, there's no proof of it, if you throw somebody in and they sink and die, they're not a witch, but if they float, you know, they're a witch, but you still kill them, basically.
[01:41:57.134 --> 01:42:00.616]  I mean, it just sounds like it lets this medical tyranny take over.
[01:42:01.757 --> 01:42:09.223]  Absolutely, and you know, from the scientific establishment perspective, it's like in this field, and you see very few people are reporting
[01:42:09.810 --> 01:42:15.814]  On exactly how they do this computer genome sequencing, because they make it impossible to understand.
[01:42:16.335 --> 01:42:23.159]  It's like three different disciplines, like computer science, right, which they know nothing about biology.
[01:42:23.179 --> 01:42:36.389]  You have geneticists, which probably know very little about viruses, and then virologists, and they're trying to come together, and it's like the right hand doesn't know what the left is doing, so no one fully understands that the whole thing is a sham.
[01:42:37.463 --> 01:42:40.904]  Wow, so I guess the Emperor's New Clothes would be a better allegory.
[01:42:41.205 --> 01:42:42.525]  What's the best allegory of this?
[01:42:43.025 --> 01:42:43.605]  Emperor's New Clothes?
[01:42:43.645 --> 01:42:44.606]  I think that's a good one.
[01:42:46.507 --> 01:42:46.847]  Wow.
[01:42:48.347 --> 01:42:49.608]  Again, what do you make of Theranos?
[01:42:49.628 --> 01:42:51.389]  We know Bill Gates was heavily involved funding that.
[01:42:51.409 --> 01:42:53.569]  They claimed they had this test that could find cancer.
[01:42:53.910 --> 01:42:56.390]  It used a bunch of computers and blood tests and other things.
[01:42:56.711 --> 01:42:58.091]  Turned out it was a complete fraud.
[01:42:59.172 --> 01:43:02.433]  I see parallels with Theranos and what's happening with this, Doctor.
[01:43:03.683 --> 01:43:17.951]  Well, you know, if you start looking through the literature at technologies that they plan to use for various insidious and evil purposes, you find thousands of articles.
[01:43:18.812 --> 01:43:23.193]  And these include many things like gene therapy, which is what we're getting at here.
[01:43:24.073 --> 01:43:33.876]  Also, various types of nanotechnology involving magnetic nanoparticles, hydrogels, graphene, machine brain interfaces.
[01:43:34.536 --> 01:43:39.537]  Like there is a whole world and this technology is not in its infancy.
[01:43:39.617 --> 01:43:45.278]  There are actually many of these devices that have been already used in experiments and shown to work.
[01:43:45.338 --> 01:43:47.559]  I mean, for example, they even have
[01:43:48.386 --> 01:43:48.626]  I think?
[01:44:12.971 --> 01:44:20.068]  paradigm shift towards this kind of transhuman technology that Kurzweil and many others have talked about for decades.
[01:44:20.993 --> 01:44:21.653]  It's incredible.
[01:44:21.773 --> 01:44:27.755]  I've been spending five, six hours a day until I'm totally exhausted reading medical literature that I don't understand most of it.
[01:44:27.775 --> 01:44:29.335]  Then I go and try to find out what they're saying about it.
[01:44:29.375 --> 01:44:31.416]  But you just mentioned it.
[01:44:31.456 --> 01:44:32.836]  They call these new life forms.
[01:44:33.076 --> 01:44:34.896]  They debate, are these new species?
[01:44:34.956 --> 01:44:35.877]  Are these new aliens?
[01:44:36.157 --> 01:44:37.937]  And they go, whatever they are, we're putting them in you.
[01:44:37.977 --> 01:44:38.737]  It's a revolution.
[01:44:39.057 --> 01:44:40.358]  We're going to see what's going to happen.
[01:44:40.378 --> 01:44:47.579]  So really, it's like the medical biotech system is raping humanity in a weird mass experiment of mad scientists.
[01:44:47.599 --> 01:44:49.700]  I think that's the best way I'd quantify it, Doctor.
[01:44:51.204 --> 01:45:07.749]  Well I totally agree and you know this kind of segues right into the question you were asking before about the Stockholm Syndrome because you know certainly we know that fear is a major manipulative force and that you can condition people and manipulate them in all sorts of ways.
[01:45:08.354 --> 01:45:22.924]  And, you know, many of the techniques that have been used in this marketing campaign through the media and other sources, you know, come right from Edward Bernays and other people who are instrumental in developing propaganda as a discipline.
[01:45:23.364 --> 01:45:37.814]  And then we find out that there were actually psychologists hired by the UK and probably many other governments, but there was a whistleblower from the UK and they were hired by their, you know, health service essentially to
[01:45:38.539 --> 01:45:43.121]  Come up with strategies to maximize the fear in the population.
[01:45:43.181 --> 01:45:43.941]  And doctor, stay there.
[01:45:43.981 --> 01:45:45.402]  I'll pull the articles up during the break.
[01:45:45.422 --> 01:45:46.623]  We'll get more into Stockholm Syndrome.
[01:45:46.643 --> 01:45:50.124]  You're a psychiatrist, you can talk about it, Dr. Andrew Kaufman, because what he's mentioning is in the news.
[01:45:50.164 --> 01:45:53.045]  They quote, mind control create maximum fear.
[01:45:53.525 --> 01:45:57.007]  And Yale was also involved, not just Oxford and Cambridge.
[01:45:57.267 --> 01:45:57.807]  We'll be right back.
[01:45:58.348 --> 01:46:03.910]  Look, they made a lot of science fiction movies and authoritarian movies where the government uses the fear of a virus to take control.
[01:46:04.690 --> 01:46:05.791]  V for Vendetta.
[01:46:06.701 --> 01:46:10.265]  Did that back in 2005, 2006, whenever it came out.
[01:46:11.627 --> 01:46:20.877]  They're now deleting a video, a report I shot in 2018, reading the Rockefeller lockstep program, and it got like 5, 6 million views.
[01:46:20.917 --> 01:46:23.260]  They took it off Facebook, Instagram, Twitter.
[01:46:23.340 --> 01:46:24.982]  It's back up to like a million views this morning.
[01:46:25.002 --> 01:46:25.682]  I'm sure it's down now.
[01:46:26.451 --> 01:46:29.173]  But they're saying it's vaccine disinfo.
[01:46:29.793 --> 01:46:33.236]  So if I had a time machine and I came forward in time, it'd be better.
[01:46:33.256 --> 01:46:34.056]  I went back in time.
[01:46:34.597 --> 01:46:35.978]  I wasn't talking about this currently.
[01:46:35.998 --> 01:46:41.962]  I was talking about how governments were saying and foundations were saying they would use this for control.
[01:46:42.022 --> 01:46:48.326]  So Dr. Andrew Kaufman is uniquely suited to talk about this from MIT and also a psychiatry degree report.
[01:46:48.386 --> 01:46:50.388]  Government scientific advisors admit
[01:46:50.848 --> 01:46:55.310]  They use, quote, totalitarian fear tactics to control people during pandemic.
[01:46:55.330 --> 01:46:56.710]  This came out in mainstream British news.
[01:46:57.731 --> 01:47:02.252]  Federal government and Yale are holding clinical trials on how best to persuade Americans to take the vaccine.
[01:47:02.292 --> 01:47:03.113]  That was last year.
[01:47:04.313 --> 01:47:06.254]  The Proclamation of National Mental Health Awareness.
[01:47:06.334 --> 01:47:09.235]  And they've got a lot of stories showing this.
[01:47:09.255 --> 01:47:10.436]  Then we see the mind control.
[01:47:10.916 --> 01:47:11.716]  MSN.com.
[01:47:11.736 --> 01:47:13.297]  They have the Pentagon involved.
[01:47:13.337 --> 01:47:14.557]  They have the British military involved.
[01:47:14.917 --> 01:47:16.098]  I'm sorry, but it's too late.
[01:47:17.170 --> 01:47:23.132]  Alabama doctor talks about treating unvaccinated COVID patients, says they beg for the vaccine.
[01:47:24.753 --> 01:47:31.895]  So again, we're talking to a psychiatrist who saw this early on, also MIT trained, Dr. Andrew Kaufman, who I really appreciate joining us.
[01:47:31.915 --> 01:47:33.075]  We've only got two segments left.
[01:47:33.115 --> 01:47:40.278]  I could talk to you for 10 hours, but you mentioned this, you talked about Stockholm syndrome, finish that thought, then go wherever you want.
[01:47:41.823 --> 01:47:53.859]  Yeah, well, you know, you can see that there's just a major effort everywhere to control people's thinking on this and make sure that they don't question what's going on.
[01:47:54.420 --> 01:47:59.006]  And, you know, I really compare this to a cult-like situation because
[01:47:59.537 --> 01:48:10.081]  You know, the television, for example, and I would say, you know, the number one way to get people out of this state would be to eradicate the television or their access to the television.
[01:48:10.121 --> 01:48:25.406]  Because if you look back at the patents, they actually use a special technology of the rhythm of how they refresh the images to put you in a suggestive brain state, an alpha wave state, which is, you know, good for learning, but it's also good for hypnosis.
[01:48:26.024 --> 01:48:29.428]  And programming, right, which they call it television programming.
[01:48:29.828 --> 01:48:48.648]  So this is a very insidious but very strong campaign to get you to believe these false notions about what's going on and much of it is about sensationalizing the fear and danger aspect because that's what will manipulate you to comply and to be afraid
[01:48:49.248 --> 01:48:49.829]  Thank you.
[01:49:03.255 --> 01:49:08.220]  Transhumanist establishment is not available for people anymore, right?
[01:49:08.300 --> 01:49:11.903]  And they've been afraid to go to the hospital because of the virus.
[01:49:11.963 --> 01:49:15.005]  The hospitals have cancelled many many services.
[01:49:15.065 --> 01:49:19.769]  There have been major layoffs of nurses and pharmacists and other personnel.
[01:49:20.230 --> 01:49:24.253]  So it's not available the same way and people are looking for alternatives.
[01:49:24.713 --> 01:49:27.196]  And this is a an amazing opportunity to
[01:49:28.047 --> 01:49:46.352]  Move toward the future of healing where we can actually address health in a true realistic way where people can actually heal and recover completely from disease and not be dependent for lifelong pharmaceuticals just to manage their symptoms.
[01:49:46.412 --> 01:49:55.394]  And I know that you promote this area because many of the things you sell on your shop are agents that promote this type of real healing.
[01:49:55.888 --> 01:49:57.589]  Let me ask you this question because I'm really impressed.
[01:49:57.609 --> 01:49:59.270]  I've seen your videos and I'm so honored to have you.
[01:49:59.310 --> 01:50:02.332]  Hopefully you can come on sometime for a commercial-free special podcast.
[01:50:02.352 --> 01:50:03.573]  Those are very popular as well.
[01:50:05.706 --> 01:50:08.048]  Again, I just take this in layman's terms, street smarts.
[01:50:08.128 --> 01:50:10.369]  I don't have any psychological training like you do.
[01:50:11.109 --> 01:50:12.730]  This upsets me a lot.
[01:50:12.770 --> 01:50:14.672]  It doesn't make me feel afraid of a virus.
[01:50:14.732 --> 01:50:16.393]  It makes me afraid of the authoritarianism.
[01:50:16.853 --> 01:50:21.436]  And most people I know, still some are buying it, but a lot of others are getting very upset.
[01:50:21.456 --> 01:50:25.758]  A lot of very calm, nice people really recognize this as a threat.
[01:50:26.119 --> 01:50:27.820]  And I don't think the medical establishment
[01:50:28.380 --> 01:50:34.343]  Realizes what they've done, because there's a lot of good people, you know, in the mainline medical establishment, as we all, I think, agree.
[01:50:34.363 --> 01:50:41.126]  But the fact that corporations have taken it over and are now exploiting the fear has really caused some major repercussions.
[01:50:41.166 --> 01:50:46.008]  And the fact that we had so much trust in the medical system, and I agree with you, that's now evaporating.
[01:50:46.648 --> 01:50:50.030]  I don't think this plan went the way Bill Gates and others thought it would.
[01:50:51.494 --> 01:50:59.977]  Well, you know, if we reference back to those, you know, what I call planning documents, like the 2010 lockstep Rockefeller document, right?
[01:50:59.997 --> 01:51:06.379]  But there are many, many others from a variety of organisms, including, you know, the SPARS simulation and event 201.
[01:51:07.919 --> 01:51:21.068]  That there's indication from many of these documents that the timeline of when this, you know, operation, because I really think this is most accurately described as a psychological operation.
[01:51:21.128 --> 01:51:31.975]  And I'm talking about the pandemic that they, you know, they accelerated things and probably because of there have been a lot of people waking up to the truth in the past years.
[01:51:32.476 --> 01:51:37.219]  And I think that, you know, the elites running the show, putting on this operation.
[01:51:38.039 --> 01:51:38.179]  Yes.
[01:51:55.899 --> 01:52:08.311]  You know, especially if you're the person there who's, you know, afraid of a totalitarian state and the Gestapo knocking on your door to hold you down and give you a vaccine, you know, those things are, of course, possible.
[01:52:09.011 --> 01:52:14.837]  But the way to prevent that is for each individual to simply make a decision for themselves.
[01:52:15.342 --> 01:52:15.482]  That's
[01:52:35.845 --> 01:52:37.287]  I see this as a major opportunity.
[01:52:37.988 --> 01:52:41.852]  I've told my wife and family, I said, don't get freaked out when they come, especially if I'm there.
[01:52:41.912 --> 01:52:48.279]  I said, if you want to invite them in, talk to them because they want us to be violent to them so they can then make it paramilitary.
[01:52:48.299 --> 01:52:51.443]  I could see that psychology being set up very obviously.
[01:52:52.628 --> 01:52:56.909]  No, I agree with you, and I might suggest a slightly different approach.
[01:52:56.989 --> 01:53:04.491]  I wouldn't invite them in your house, because maybe they would see something there that would, you know... You're right, maybe talk to them in the front yard.
[01:53:05.012 --> 01:53:11.813]  But yeah, in the front yard, on the front porch, and don't give them information, but instead, I mean, don't give them information about you.
[01:53:12.414 --> 01:53:14.754]  Instead, give them information about the science.
[01:53:14.814 --> 01:53:16.955]  Like if you, for example, print out the
[01:53:17.375 --> 01:53:19.236]  And you can also hand them the Nuremberg Code.
[01:53:19.256 --> 01:53:21.016]  Have the Nuremberg Code printed up and just ready.
[01:53:21.116 --> 01:53:26.078]  And just say, you know, bullying someone into forced medical stuff is punishable by really bad stuff.
[01:53:42.230 --> 01:53:42.991]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:53:43.051 --> 01:53:45.192]  I've talked a lot about the Nuremberg Code.
[01:53:45.212 --> 01:54:01.403]  I've even talked about it with Vera Sharov, who is a survivor of the Holocaust, because she recognized so many parallels between the early Nazi regime and how they started to co-opt vulnerable people in the population for medical experiments and even euthanasia.
[01:54:02.043 --> 01:54:05.065]  And that's where the Nuremberg Code came from, right?
[01:54:05.265 --> 01:54:11.810]  And when I was a scientist in the medical school environment at Upstate Medical University,
[01:54:12.610 --> 01:54:35.989]  I did human subjects research and I had to go through this extensive training and it covered the Nuremberg Code because that applies to all human subjects research and it says that you have to inform the people about the risks of the experiment and they have to voluntarily participate and you have to take extra special safeguards
[01:54:36.621 --> 01:55:01.932]  To make sure that their voluntariness is genuine and we've seen this completely ignored by every government in the world and not only by governments but you know universities, private companies have taken it upon themselves to dictate to us that we have to take experimental medical treatments if we want to participate with their goods and services.
[01:55:03.203 --> 01:55:04.984]  Absolutely holding us hostage.
[01:55:05.044 --> 01:55:05.324]  Wow.
[01:55:05.484 --> 01:55:06.965]  Well, I've always been impressed with your works.
[01:55:06.985 --> 01:55:07.926]  I learned about it over a year ago.
[01:55:08.246 --> 01:55:09.146]  Dr. Andrew Kaufman.
[01:55:09.586 --> 01:55:10.387]  What's the best place?
[01:55:10.407 --> 01:55:11.287]  We've got one more segment left.
[01:55:11.307 --> 01:55:18.551]  When we come back, folks, right now, the best place to find him, YouTube, Andrew Kaufman, and we'll give you more information on the other side.
[01:55:18.571 --> 01:55:26.015]  I'm Alex Jones, obviously with the Demon Eyes and AttackedInfoWars.com and FreeWorldNews.tv, and we'll post this archive there as well.
[01:55:27.316 --> 01:55:28.757]  Well, very impressive guest.
[01:55:30.083 --> 01:55:35.146]  Dr. Andrew Kaufman will put up on screen for TV viewers his website so you can visit it.
[01:55:35.246 --> 01:55:44.531]  He has written books and is an expert on a lot of really serious issues like suicide and alcohol and so many other things.
[01:55:45.312 --> 01:55:49.074]  And so be sure and visit his website that you see there on screen.
[01:55:49.094 --> 01:55:54.777]  But the actual URL, Doc, for radio listeners, give people the actual URL for Dr. Andrew Kaufman's site.
[01:55:56.423 --> 01:56:02.286]  It's AndrewKaufmanMD.com, that's 1F and 1N, and MD like medical doctor.
[01:56:02.306 --> 01:56:03.887]  Alright, there it is on screen.
[01:56:04.547 --> 01:56:08.869]  Again, that's Dr. AndrewKaufmanMD.com.
[01:56:09.389 --> 01:56:10.810]  Alright, we've got 10 minutes left.
[01:56:11.030 --> 01:56:12.551]  You've imparted a lot of knowledge so far.
[01:56:12.611 --> 01:56:15.092]  I've got a lot of questions, but what else do you want to get to?
[01:56:15.112 --> 01:56:17.053]  And I want to ask you, how do we fight back against this?
[01:56:17.073 --> 01:56:19.154]  I agree, we use this as an opportunity.
[01:56:20.596 --> 01:56:22.797]  They say every two or three generations face a real tyranny.
[01:56:23.497 --> 01:56:24.638]  We now have a real tyranny.
[01:56:24.658 --> 01:56:25.798]  At least we know what it is.
[01:56:26.258 --> 01:56:27.639]  We know the type of warfare it is.
[01:56:27.659 --> 01:56:34.941]  And so I think it's actually an opportunity if folks get moving now against it, we're gonna be able to defeat this generation's evil.
[01:56:35.001 --> 01:56:37.402]  If not though, this is a very sticky problem.
[01:56:39.093 --> 01:56:40.735]  Yeah, I completely agree.
[01:56:40.795 --> 01:56:51.084]  And I actually, you know, see a kind of separation of our society into, you know, two factions, like those of us who decide that we're not going to participate.
[01:56:51.124 --> 01:56:55.949]  We see the truth of what's going on, and we're going to essentially start
[01:56:56.409 --> 01:57:23.603]  Doing things our own way because you know if you're going to make a decision To not comply and not give in to what's going on right now And I hope that everyone who's aware of the truth will take that approach You're gonna have to make some sacrifices right like you have to resign yourself that you know air travel for example is Not going to be an option in the short term and maybe that you're not going to be able to go overseas You know across international borders
[01:57:23.823 --> 01:57:27.287]  Which is just an insane level of oppression and control.
[01:57:27.467 --> 01:57:30.471]  I mean, it's just zero to 500 in one second.
[01:57:32.092 --> 01:57:32.713]  Absolutely.
[01:57:32.753 --> 01:57:34.795]  It is, you know, unprecedented.
[01:57:34.855 --> 01:57:38.179]  And, you know, we never thought that these freedoms would be threatened.
[01:57:38.199 --> 01:57:44.126]  But, you know, if you look back a little over 100 years ago, there were no such thing as passports.
[01:57:45.047 --> 01:57:49.669]  So people could freely travel across borders without any hindrance whatsoever.
[01:57:49.709 --> 01:57:55.432]  You didn't have to, you know, go to the government and wait three months to get a document and then have all sorts of problems.
[01:57:55.872 --> 01:58:03.616]  So really this has been an incremental and a very subtle attack on our freedoms that is just accelerated out of control.
[01:58:04.276 --> 01:58:14.831]  And so we need to get back to taking responsibility for ourselves and that includes our health, that includes learning how to do things for ourselves, that includes
[01:58:15.273 --> 01:58:15.573]  I think so.
[01:58:35.180 --> 01:58:35.521]  at all.
[01:58:49.221 --> 01:58:49.441]  About
[01:59:08.634 --> 01:59:20.458]  Those are the kind of things that are going to really make these things possible to be, you know, off the grid, but still have an amazing quality of life and get back to our relationship with nature.
[01:59:20.798 --> 01:59:21.959]  Well, that's right, Dr. Kaufman.
[01:59:22.219 --> 01:59:27.301]  My instincts, I'm 47 now, I always ignored my instincts when I was younger, unless it was chasing a girl.
[01:59:28.161 --> 01:59:38.432]  Every time I go with my instincts, which is really our unconscious mind, our genetic memories, whatever you want to call it, whatever people want to see it as, is your basic instinct, has always been right.
[01:59:38.512 --> 01:59:43.737]  And all my instinct says is, go to an area, get a farm, get to know everybody, learn how to be self-sufficient.
[01:59:44.317 --> 01:59:47.300]  That's all my genetics, all my brain is telling me.
[01:59:47.961 --> 01:59:53.206]  Your view or your psychological study, I don't know your background, but obviously I mesh with what you're saying.
[01:59:53.226 --> 01:59:54.547]  It all makes perfect sense.
[01:59:55.047 --> 01:59:56.489]  What would you call that drive?
[01:59:56.529 --> 01:59:57.790]  Where do you think that comes from?
[01:59:57.950 --> 02:00:01.853]  And obviously we better listen to it, because now it's not a tap on the shoulder.
[02:00:01.913 --> 02:00:04.375]  It's like, do it, do it, do it, do it.
[02:00:04.416 --> 02:00:06.357]  I mean, it's like a banging noise in my head.
[02:00:06.677 --> 02:00:08.579]  Get out of the city, get self-sufficient.
[02:00:08.699 --> 02:00:13.724]  And everybody I talk to that's dialed in, that's tuned in, is saying the same thing.
[02:00:14.881 --> 02:00:42.382]  Yeah, I mean, most of my efforts are toward that goal as well right now, and I think what we need to realize is that from the time we were brought into the world, we have really been indoctrinated to a specific cultural phenomenon, right, as well as the compulsory schooling system, so where we, you know, accept authority figures' word as the gospel, where we don't question things, we don't, you know, challenge ideas or think for ourselves, and we don't take care of ourselves.
[02:00:42.422 --> 02:00:42.903]  We expect
[02:00:43.423 --> 02:00:43.623]  I think?
[02:01:13.402 --> 02:01:29.250]  Right, which is to interact with the land, with the forest, with the ecology and with each other in communities, not to interact with technology, not to be, you know, slaves for a wage that just basically allows us to subsist.
[02:01:29.350 --> 02:01:36.074]  And then as soon as we get an iota of free time, all we want to do is escape, drink beer, watch sports.
[02:01:36.550 --> 02:01:47.876]  Play video games, watch TV, and instead of having a real meaningful sense of purpose in our life, which we can now regain with this amazing opportunity.
[02:01:48.336 --> 02:01:58.402]  Instead of that magic moment with your wife or your friends, your children, on the edge of a cliff when the stars come up and you hear the cicadas and the frogs and it's like you're just magic.
[02:01:58.942 --> 02:02:03.986]  Total satisfaction and fulfillment versus on an iPhone or a computer doing work.
[02:02:04.487 --> 02:02:07.509]  You just feel your humanity being drained off.
[02:02:07.829 --> 02:02:08.950]  It's just not who we are.
[02:02:10.311 --> 02:02:13.314]  That's an amazing visual representation, Alex.
[02:02:13.374 --> 02:02:18.978]  And you know, all you have to do is look at the World Economic Forum's vision for the future, right?
[02:02:19.058 --> 02:02:26.905]  And you see that it doesn't involve those aspects and that they want us to have all of our social interactions to be virtual.
[02:02:27.285 --> 02:02:27.465]  Right?
[02:02:27.485 --> 02:02:29.288]  Because that is quote-unquote safe.
[02:02:29.668 --> 02:02:36.536]  But that is not human and it doesn't provide the basic elements that we need in our life like human contact.
[02:02:36.556 --> 02:02:37.717]  Isn't that a form of worship?
[02:02:37.777 --> 02:02:41.402]  It's like they said the Greek gods died in allegory because they weren't worshipped anymore.
[02:02:41.822 --> 02:02:43.744]  They want us worshipping their AI.
[02:02:43.804 --> 02:02:45.767]  They want us only interfacing with it.
[02:02:46.387 --> 02:02:53.352]  Watching their porn via computer, doing everything through it, watching people eat food on a computer, instead of separating ourselves from it.
[02:02:53.652 --> 02:02:58.395]  We become slaves of the tool, it becomes the master, it becomes the robot god.
[02:02:59.436 --> 02:03:05.600]  And notice all those examples you mentioned put us in a lower consciousness, a lower state of being, right?
[02:03:05.620 --> 02:03:13.825]  It's about decadence and, you know, like the pornography is a great example because, you know, we have this amazing
[02:03:14.515 --> 02:03:21.960]  Uh, divine ability to connect with other people and, and have this amazing intimacy and to bring new lives into the world.
[02:03:22.540 --> 02:03:37.409]  And that is, you know, can be totally corrupted by getting people addicted to pornography and taking all of the specialness, all of the sacred elements out of it so that it puts you in that lower base level.
[02:03:37.950 --> 02:03:38.210]  Right.
[02:03:38.330 --> 02:03:41.352]  And then, you know, it's stealing the very life force.
[02:03:43.615 --> 02:03:44.096]  Yes it is.
[02:03:44.997 --> 02:03:45.658]  Absolutely.
[02:03:57.714 --> 02:04:11.693]  Well, there are so many ways we can go, but I think it's really important to just be open to new information and to figure out what's going on and always check people's sources.
[02:04:11.753 --> 02:04:14.136]  Don't trust anything that I reported on this show.
[02:04:15.097 --> 02:04:17.240]  Look for a confirmatory evidence.
[02:04:17.341 --> 02:04:19.384]  Look at the primary source material.
[02:04:19.904 --> 02:04:20.886]  Make your own opinion.
[02:04:20.906 --> 02:04:28.337]  If you're not capable of understanding what's going on right now, then spend some time to learn how to understand it.
[02:04:30.951 --> 02:04:58.033]  More than doable for every you know average person out there of average intelligence can take a few hours understand what's going on and then that'll put you in a position to consider all the aspects about the future that we've been talking about that you can take independent action, you can reclaim your human nature, you can develop communities and you can have a really rich and meaningful
[02:04:58.673 --> 02:04:59.334]  We're good to go.
[02:05:18.049 --> 02:05:18.529]  That's right.
[02:05:18.589 --> 02:05:28.012]  And you know, keeping changing the rules is a tactic to keep us off balance and make sure that we just go along with it because we don't even know what we're supposed to go along with.
[02:05:28.472 --> 02:05:28.712]  Right.
[02:05:28.892 --> 02:05:33.574]  But of course, you can also look at that and say, well, these things don't even make sense.
[02:05:33.694 --> 02:05:34.894]  They don't even fit.
[02:05:35.564 --> 02:05:41.949]  What people say, like people who are vaccinated, they don't believe that the vaccine actually does what it's supposed to do.
[02:05:42.109 --> 02:05:47.653]  Otherwise, why would they care about what anyone else does if they can't get the illness, right?
[02:05:47.693 --> 02:05:48.834]  That's all common sense.
[02:05:48.874 --> 02:05:51.075]  Dr. Dr. Andrew Kaufman, thank you so much for the time.
[02:05:51.315 --> 02:05:51.776]  God bless you.
[02:05:52.916 --> 02:05:53.617]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:05:53.657 --> 02:05:54.257]  Great to be here.
[02:05:54.438 --> 02:05:57.920]  We'll be back with our number four, Mike Adams and Tommy Robinson.
[02:05:57.940 --> 02:05:58.340]  Stay with us.
[02:05:59.401 --> 02:06:00.322]  Tommy Robinson.
[02:06:02.205 --> 02:06:03.945]  is a folk hero in the United Kingdom.
[02:06:04.806 --> 02:06:11.187]  Twelve, thirteen years ago, found them smuggling little girls, kidnapping them, grooming them, raping them, and killing them.
[02:06:12.427 --> 02:06:20.249]  And years after he exposed it, five, six years after it came out in the news, in the one town he talked about, thousands of kidnapped little girls, some of them murdered.
[02:06:20.669 --> 02:06:23.010]  TR.NEWS, Tommy Robinson.
[02:06:23.570 --> 02:06:24.730]  I've been trying to get him on for a year.
[02:06:24.830 --> 02:06:26.431]  He's been gone, he's been disappeared.
[02:06:26.491 --> 02:06:27.391]  I bought him cameras.
[02:06:28.011 --> 02:06:30.492]  I'm not bitching, I'm just saying I got him cameras, gave him the money to do it.
[02:06:31.232 --> 02:06:32.233]  He got thrown in prison.
[02:06:33.053 --> 02:06:34.334]  I wanted to film about the grooming.
[02:06:34.374 --> 02:06:38.917]  I wanted to film about the boats coming across from Europe with the Islamic invaders.
[02:06:39.497 --> 02:06:41.198]  Well, I get a call at like 5 a.m.
[02:06:41.218 --> 02:06:42.599]  this morning and Tommy doesn't know.
[02:06:42.619 --> 02:06:44.620]  He says, I'm gonna find out later.
[02:06:44.640 --> 02:06:45.681]  I'll talk to you this afternoon.
[02:06:46.261 --> 02:06:55.466]  But then I noticed that it's already uploaded, this trailer, and so I wanted you to see this for the new film because it's a big national news story.
[02:06:57.187 --> 02:06:58.328]  Here it is out of the BBC.
[02:06:58.388 --> 02:06:59.569]  Tommy Robinson loses
[02:07:01.400 --> 02:07:04.163]  Libel case with Jamal Hajazi.
[02:07:05.144 --> 02:07:05.664]  I remember that.
[02:07:05.684 --> 02:07:11.851]  I remember Piers Morgan attacking him, saying, oh, the evil white people, the evil English were waterboarding a poor Muslim.
[02:07:12.532 --> 02:07:13.793]  But what really happened?
[02:07:13.813 --> 02:07:17.216]  Well, Tommy covered that, and they say he lost a libel case today.
[02:07:17.236 --> 02:07:21.241]  Well, here's a trailer for a film I know he was going to be releasing soon.
[02:07:21.521 --> 02:07:22.942]  We'll ask him when it's coming out in a moment.
[02:07:22.962 --> 02:07:23.303]  Here it is.
[02:07:24.747 --> 02:07:29.629]  Everybody was exposing the scumbag that did this, who I hope gets severe retribution.
[02:07:29.649 --> 02:07:31.530]  I hope his parents take action.
[02:07:31.750 --> 02:07:32.030]  Right?
[02:07:32.070 --> 02:07:33.451]  Never mind anything else.
[02:07:33.851 --> 02:07:34.871]  What are you producing here?
[02:07:35.311 --> 02:07:36.612]  With this vermin?
[02:07:36.972 --> 02:07:38.232]  I'm here because I face a court case.
[02:07:38.633 --> 02:07:39.493]  I'm being prosecuted.
[02:07:39.593 --> 02:07:40.533]  It's gone to the High Court.
[02:07:40.894 --> 02:07:43.735]  And I have to prove, I made a video stating that it was a lie.
[02:07:44.135 --> 02:07:45.475]  Stating that Jamal wasn't innocent.
[02:07:45.735 --> 02:07:47.896]  And telling some facts about Jamal beating up girls.
[02:07:48.316 --> 02:07:53.318]  An instance I've been warned about by the members of this community to tell the truth about what happened at this school.
[02:07:53.359 --> 02:07:54.299]  You've got everything here.
[02:07:54.679 --> 02:07:55.499]  Cameras, glasses.
[02:07:55.539 --> 02:07:57.120]  I don't wear glasses, so that's gonna be awkward.
[02:07:57.140 --> 02:07:58.261]  I feel like James Bond.
[02:07:58.481 --> 02:08:00.782]  It is a mess, but it's a tragedy.
[02:08:00.922 --> 02:08:02.002]  It's a tragedy for Bailey.
[02:08:02.182 --> 02:08:06.124]  The idea that people would maraud the streets looking for him was appalling.
[02:08:06.404 --> 02:08:09.886]  Give her that one where he hit that girl with a hockey stick, won't he?
[02:08:10.006 --> 02:08:18.089]  We were playing hockey with a teacher called Mr. Cattell, and just felt a really sharp pain in my back, and he'd swung the hockey stick over his head and hit me in the spine with it.
[02:08:18.509 --> 02:08:19.430]  It knocked me to my knees.
[02:08:19.830 --> 02:08:22.393]  Jamal grabbed him by his tie, which just threw him against the wall.
[02:08:22.534 --> 02:08:25.558]  Cracked his head open against backup wall and just kept throwing him against the wall.
[02:08:25.618 --> 02:08:27.340]  This kid was out unconscious already.
[02:08:27.360 --> 02:08:28.722]  That's just malicious.
[02:08:29.262 --> 02:08:30.564]  That's just intent to kill.
[02:08:30.965 --> 02:08:35.010]  If you could sum up Jamal then, after meeting him, if you could sum him up in a few words, how would you describe him?
[02:08:35.651 --> 02:08:35.931]  Later.
[02:08:36.372 --> 02:08:37.734]  Because Bailey's life was destroyed.
[02:08:37.934 --> 02:08:38.074]  Yeah.
[02:08:41.055 --> 02:08:45.839]  This is the accommodation that Bailey's mother and children were being relocated to.
[02:08:46.059 --> 02:08:47.300]  No one cared for this family.
[02:08:47.320 --> 02:08:49.542]  They were all casualties of this lie.
[02:08:49.562 --> 02:08:50.943]  The media should be held accountable for this.
[02:08:51.203 --> 02:08:53.245]  It went to China, it went to Australia, it went to everywhere.
[02:08:53.465 --> 02:08:54.325]  It wasn't global news.
[02:08:54.345 --> 02:08:55.646]  They made it global news.
[02:08:56.027 --> 02:08:58.088]  Every kid I spoke to that he attacked was younger.
[02:08:58.909 --> 02:08:59.069]  Yeah.
[02:08:59.549 --> 02:08:59.790]  Bullock.
[02:09:00.697 --> 02:09:01.177]  Jamal who?
[02:09:01.217 --> 02:09:01.378]  Jamal?
[02:09:01.438 --> 02:09:01.638]  Yeah.
[02:09:01.938 --> 02:09:04.700]  Everyone's confirming what Jamal was like, including school staff.
[02:09:05.601 --> 02:09:12.846]  But as soon as I mentioned this camera, as soon as I mentioned court, I need someone to come to court, they just totally silenced Traveller.
[02:09:12.886 --> 02:09:14.327]  No one can know I've said that.
[02:09:14.608 --> 02:09:20.192]  He started calling my mum and my wife out, but she said something and he put me in a headlock and then my mate pushed him off me.
[02:09:20.532 --> 02:09:21.773]  I believe that's how he broke his arm.
[02:09:21.954 --> 02:09:31.103]  This is about as much as proving in court as proving to you, the British public, that I was the only journalist in the country who told the truth about what happened in this community.
[02:09:31.644 --> 02:09:32.845]  I call it a perfect storm.
[02:09:32.945 --> 02:09:38.070]  I was getting emails from Pakistan, from Australia, from America, telling me to resign.
[02:09:38.351 --> 02:09:41.254]  I came into teaching to help poor people.
[02:09:42.014 --> 02:09:42.115]  And...
[02:09:44.156 --> 02:09:46.897]  How much money have they spent on this life?
[02:09:47.137 --> 02:09:54.179]  Person after person's life destroyed, while the council, your local council, give away hundreds of thousands of pounds to make sure that the truth can never be told.
[02:09:54.199 --> 02:09:58.280]  We don't need to be scared, Sonia, because they're purposely just doing that.
[02:09:58.340 --> 02:09:58.920]  A moment.
[02:10:14.798 --> 02:10:17.841]  Oh, by the way, Tommy, I am gonna meet your kids, mate.
[02:10:24.808 --> 02:10:30.794]  Alright, so... It's Silence, an InfoWars film presented by Tommy Robinson, coming soon.
[02:10:31.274 --> 02:10:32.375]  Tommy, we barely talked.
[02:10:32.395 --> 02:10:33.316]  You couldn't talk this morning.
[02:10:33.336 --> 02:10:34.177]  You said you're going to court.
[02:10:34.217 --> 02:10:34.858]  You talked to me later.
[02:10:34.878 --> 02:10:36.600]  I don't know what's happened since then.
[02:10:36.980 --> 02:10:37.941]  What's going on with the film?
[02:10:37.961 --> 02:10:38.762]  What happened in court today?
[02:10:40.777 --> 02:10:42.618]  That's why I've been trying to get a hold of you, Alex.
[02:10:42.638 --> 02:10:48.539]  So, crazily, I'll ask you, I'll probably need you to delete that promo.
[02:10:49.760 --> 02:10:54.101]  We can have a discussion off there about where we go, what we do with the film.
[02:10:54.121 --> 02:10:57.622]  I don't think... I'm sorry, but we haven't talked in weeks.
[02:10:58.162 --> 02:11:02.023]  I mean, the trailer, that was supposed to be... So, we need to take that down?
[02:11:04.203 --> 02:11:07.884]  Judging by the injunction, I've been served with an injunction today, yeah?
[02:11:08.204 --> 02:11:13.766]  Now, it's your film, it's your footage, it's produced for you, but we do have to have a serious talk.
[02:11:13.786 --> 02:11:15.286]  Okay, so I didn't know this happened.
[02:11:15.626 --> 02:11:16.967]  You were just telling me you were going to court today.
[02:11:17.707 --> 02:11:18.187]  What's happened?
[02:11:18.207 --> 02:11:21.728]  We'll take it down if you want, but we're not allowed to show the trailer for the film?
[02:11:23.368 --> 02:11:30.310]  I have an injunction that prevents me from... There's so much I can't say.
[02:11:30.330 --> 02:11:32.211]  So basically, with this case,
[02:11:33.883 --> 02:11:48.387]  With this case, so everyone understands what's going on, I went and wore a hidden camera, okay, and I approached school members and staff, and I had the head teacher of the school, I had the head of the isolation unit, I had dinner ladies, I had office workers, I had all of them.
[02:11:49.047 --> 02:11:53.608]  All of them telling, openly on camera, totally corroborating
[02:11:54.790 --> 02:11:57.874]  The version of events that I discussed.
[02:11:58.635 --> 02:12:04.582]  I'm not allowed to re-say any of what's been said by the people.
[02:12:04.602 --> 02:12:12.311]  For folks that don't know, they had a reported Muslim from Syria in school beating people up.
[02:12:12.992 --> 02:12:14.715]  They demonized the kids that fought back.
[02:12:15.155 --> 02:12:16.197]  You did a story on it.
[02:12:16.397 --> 02:12:18.740]  You just lost a libel case that you said was going to be rigged.
[02:12:19.121 --> 02:12:20.563]  I knew months ago you talked about it.
[02:12:20.623 --> 02:12:21.504]  I saw you on the news.
[02:12:22.145 --> 02:12:26.551]  And so now they're saying, wait, you can't even put out a film documenting that you told the truth?
[02:12:26.651 --> 02:12:26.871]  Wow.
[02:12:27.850 --> 02:12:34.897]  So basically what I've done is I went and I interviewed people and I wore hidden footage and I got all these different people talking about what happened.
[02:12:34.937 --> 02:12:44.246]  And Alex, the craziest part of this film, yeah, I don't think you had a chance to watch it entirely, you've got it, but judging by what you said there, on this film... No, I mean, I'll be honest, we're funding a lot of films.
[02:12:44.286 --> 02:12:48.851]  I know it's been in for a few weeks, I haven't watched it, because I was just waiting for you to... Okay, so, yeah, tell me.
[02:12:49.792 --> 02:12:51.614]  Where is... Basically...
[02:12:52.580 --> 02:12:59.268]  When this story blew up, the story blew up that there was a horrible racist white English bully, and there was a poor victim Syrian refugee.
[02:12:59.548 --> 02:13:03.914]  And that story was made into global news, it was taken to CNN, it was taken all over.
[02:13:03.934 --> 02:13:08.739]  Every politician, celebrity, stars, they all pushed this story and this narrative.
[02:13:08.799 --> 02:13:11.623]  It's like Carl Rittenhouse, the ultimate evil is fighting back.
[02:13:12.594 --> 02:13:20.661]  We were told that because the Syrian boy had his arm in plaster cast and we were told that was done in an incident of racist bullying, yeah?
[02:13:20.861 --> 02:13:22.363]  That's what we were told by the media.
[02:13:22.763 --> 02:13:31.371]  Now I was contacted by parents and I saw online one young girl make serious allegations and another young girl's mum make serious allegations.
[02:13:32.011 --> 02:13:33.333]  So I simply contacted them.
[02:13:33.353 --> 02:13:34.554]  This is before my involvement.
[02:13:35.094 --> 02:13:36.836]  Then I saw that one girl deleted them.
[02:13:37.839 --> 02:13:39.559]  And another woman put out a retraction.
[02:13:40.019 --> 02:13:49.442]  So when I went and wore undercover footage, the mother that done the retraction, I got on camera saying, Tommy, I only retracted it because they threatened to rape me.
[02:13:50.042 --> 02:13:51.322]  We have to live here, yeah?
[02:13:51.562 --> 02:13:53.322]  So that's why she retracted her story.
[02:13:53.622 --> 02:13:56.283]  The other little girl said she was terrified, she was worried.
[02:13:56.603 --> 02:14:05.485]  Now the scary part of this is that while this was blowing up onto the world's news, the reality of all of the school records, of all of the witness statements, of all of the emails,
[02:14:05.885 --> 02:14:09.186]  They prove a totally different story and they prove that the school knew the truth.
[02:14:09.486 --> 02:14:10.807]  They prove the police knew the truth.
[02:14:10.987 --> 02:14:13.008]  They prove everyone knew the truth.
[02:14:13.368 --> 02:14:17.169]  And I sat there thinking, why is no one defending this other English child?
[02:14:17.470 --> 02:14:20.251]  Why is no one speaking the reality of the situation here?
[02:14:20.851 --> 02:14:26.673]  And when I went with my undercover cameras, I went to one Asian teacher and he said, Tommy, I've took the money.
[02:14:26.993 --> 02:14:28.174]  I have all of this on camera.
[02:14:28.934 --> 02:14:30.435]  I said, what do you mean you've took the money?
[02:14:30.955 --> 02:14:32.275]  He goes, they paid me.
[02:14:32.956 --> 02:14:33.796]  I said, who paid you?
[02:14:34.471 --> 02:14:35.631]  Kirk Lees Council.
[02:14:36.032 --> 02:14:38.613]  That is the local council government for that area.
[02:14:39.093 --> 02:14:40.913]  I said, what did they pay you for?
[02:14:41.394 --> 02:14:43.074]  He said, I've signed a non-disclosure agreement.
[02:14:43.154 --> 02:14:44.595]  I'm not allowed to talk about it.
[02:14:45.275 --> 02:14:46.315]  I said, how much did they pay you? £18,000.
[02:14:48.803 --> 02:14:51.365]  Then I have the headteacher, and this is all documented.
[02:14:51.725 --> 02:14:56.308]  Then I have the headteacher, but the only problem is, I'm now under an injunction.
[02:14:56.729 --> 02:15:00.891]  I can't show everyone the evidence that I have that totally proves the corruption!
[02:15:00.931 --> 02:15:02.152]  Okay, well listen, we're out of time.
[02:15:02.192 --> 02:15:03.533]  You've got to come back on tomorrow.
[02:15:03.573 --> 02:15:05.855]  I've got to talk to you once this is over because Mike Adams is coming up.
[02:15:07.168 --> 02:15:08.189]  I know it's a libel case.
[02:15:08.209 --> 02:15:09.269]  I know they claim you lost it.
[02:15:09.349 --> 02:15:10.770]  I know you got the proof that's bull.
[02:15:11.211 --> 02:15:16.414]  They don't want you to put out the film showing this is a setup to say that Muslims are perfect, British are bad.
[02:15:16.434 --> 02:15:17.915]  I mean, I get that.
[02:15:18.355 --> 02:15:19.176]  I saw it in the news.
[02:15:19.256 --> 02:15:19.976]  It was a setup.
[02:15:20.697 --> 02:15:22.358]  And so I'm wondering where you've been for a year.
[02:15:22.418 --> 02:15:23.399]  It's good to have you back.
[02:15:24.319 --> 02:15:24.980]  God bless you.
[02:15:25.040 --> 02:15:25.900]  How do people find you?
[02:15:25.940 --> 02:15:26.821]  TR.NEWS?
[02:15:27.751 --> 02:15:35.565]  See at the minute, at the minute just on Telegram, Tommy Robinson news on Telegram is where our politics are shared.
[02:15:35.605 --> 02:15:38.510]  Tommy Robinson, we got Mike Adams coming up, he doesn't mind.
[02:15:38.951 --> 02:15:40.714]  You'll do two more minutes on the other side to finish up.
[02:15:41.952 --> 02:15:51.455]  Alright, I'm about to duck out of here because Mike Adams is always loaded for bear and I don't want to disrespect him from naturalnews.com, but Tommy Robinson called me cryptically this morning.
[02:15:51.495 --> 02:15:52.275]  I gotta be in court.
[02:15:52.315 --> 02:15:53.536]  I can't tell you what's going on.
[02:15:53.556 --> 02:15:56.457]  Don't know about that film I'm making for you, but you got it.
[02:15:57.097 --> 02:16:06.140]  And then I'm just here on air, him saying, delete the trailer off of Bandot Video and that he's been ordered and it's in the BBC News.
[02:16:07.160 --> 02:16:13.541]  To not talk about the Muslims who are as pure as the driven snow and perfect angel cakes.
[02:16:14.001 --> 02:16:15.102]  So I haven't seen the film.
[02:16:15.162 --> 02:16:15.862]  I don't know what's in it.
[02:16:15.882 --> 02:16:18.082]  I know we've got a copy of it because we financed it.
[02:16:18.822 --> 02:16:23.723]  We just financed a big film about the boats coming across too from France with National File.
[02:16:24.324 --> 02:16:27.884]  So Tommy, just in closing, you're coming back tomorrow at noon to give us updates.
[02:16:27.924 --> 02:16:30.645]  I can talk to you off air because I don't want to sound half-cocked.
[02:16:31.085 --> 02:16:32.625]  This is all happening live on air right now.
[02:16:33.045 --> 02:16:35.546]  You made a film to challenge what they claimed you were wrong.
[02:16:36.266 --> 02:16:38.488]  They're saying you can't put that out now, or what's happening?
[02:16:39.769 --> 02:16:43.593]  Alex, I sat today and I filmed myself getting the verdict, because I've done it via video link.
[02:16:44.353 --> 02:16:49.498]  And when I got the verdict that I lost, people would be surprised, but I was like, get in there, yeah?
[02:16:50.447 --> 02:16:55.590]  For the reason that the film proves the corruption of the media.
[02:16:55.630 --> 02:16:56.170]  It proves it.
[02:16:56.470 --> 02:16:57.411]  They were told the truth.
[02:16:57.691 --> 02:17:02.774]  I have recordings of the chair of governors telling us they sat with journalists, they told them the truth, it was hidden.
[02:17:03.654 --> 02:17:05.235]  So it proves the corruption.
[02:17:05.255 --> 02:17:11.679]  I have the proof of the corruption of the local council who are paying all the teachers to remain silent and not to tell the truth.
[02:17:11.959 --> 02:17:15.041]  I have all the recordings of the head teacher downwards saying that, yeah?
[02:17:15.721 --> 02:17:22.972]  A big international story, you know, kind of like we saw with the Catholic kids at the Capitol and they said they were attacking people.
[02:17:22.992 --> 02:17:23.633]  It wasn't true.
[02:17:23.993 --> 02:17:31.745]  This is basically a similar story where people are being attacked, they fight back, they're being demonized, and so now they don't want you putting this film out.
[02:17:32.967 --> 02:17:37.831]  And they don't want a film going out, but this would then prove what is the unholy alliance.
[02:17:38.432 --> 02:17:43.356]  It is the alliance of the media, it's the alliance of the politicians, it's the alliance of our judicial systems.
[02:17:43.917 --> 02:17:48.541]  And all of it, working together hand in hand, along with corrupt lawyers, okay?
[02:17:49.862 --> 02:17:57.029]  And far-left extremists, because this film shows a campaign of hate, intimidation, a putt against everyone.
[02:17:57.069 --> 02:18:01.153]  It's the reason it was called Silence, because everyone from start to finish had been silenced.
[02:18:01.453 --> 02:18:06.578]  And I sit here now with a perfect name for the film, because I've been silenced, because I've got a gag in all of them.
[02:18:07.083 --> 02:18:10.366]  I've got a gag in order that I can't have anything to do with the film that you have.
[02:18:10.386 --> 02:18:11.487]  Okay, well let me just say this.
[02:18:11.587 --> 02:18:12.447]  We have the film.
[02:18:12.467 --> 02:18:13.829]  I'm going to go watch it after the show.
[02:18:14.649 --> 02:18:18.692]  And Tommy, I pay for the film, so I'm going to make the decision whether I'm going to put the film out or not.
[02:18:19.153 --> 02:18:20.474]  But the trailer's going to stay up.
[02:18:20.994 --> 02:18:22.556]  I'm not the Soviet Union yet.
[02:18:22.656 --> 02:18:27.359]  My answer is just didn't die for freedom, you know, and fight Hitler to live like this.
[02:18:27.840 --> 02:18:31.363]  Silenced, an Infowars film presented by Tommy Robinson stays up.
[02:18:31.903 --> 02:18:34.224]  I don't care what the Islamicists and all their armies say.
[02:18:35.024 --> 02:18:36.185]  So the trailer stays up.
[02:18:36.205 --> 02:18:41.967]  I hope it goes viral now and I hope it gets out there because we need freedom of speech now more than ever.
[02:18:42.367 --> 02:18:48.269]  Join me tomorrow at noon to give us the latest and have time to flesh all this out.
[02:18:48.649 --> 02:18:50.330]  But Tommy, you've been gone for a year.
[02:18:50.370 --> 02:18:53.631]  I know they've attacked your house, attacked your family, attacked your wife.
[02:18:53.691 --> 02:18:55.652]  I know it's been rough, but you're ready to speak.
[02:18:55.672 --> 02:18:59.854]  So we'll talk about where Tommy Robinson's been tomorrow in like 21 hours, okay?
[02:19:01.556 --> 02:19:04.359]  Okay, sound Alex, we'll talk off air as well, yeah?
[02:19:04.399 --> 02:19:05.761]  Yeah, I'll call you right after this, okay?
[02:19:07.103 --> 02:19:07.463]  Thanks.
[02:19:07.583 --> 02:19:08.905]  Haven't talked to him since before court.
[02:19:09.446 --> 02:19:09.766]  Alright!
[02:19:10.987 --> 02:19:11.548]  There you go.
[02:19:11.588 --> 02:19:13.170]  The fight for freedom continues.
[02:19:13.630 --> 02:19:15.152]  The fight for free speech continues.
[02:19:15.593 --> 02:19:17.956]  Those that don't want you to be able to make your own decision, they're your enemy.
[02:19:18.576 --> 02:19:20.499]  Mike Adams, NaturalNews.com, takes over.
[02:19:22.847 --> 02:19:23.447]  All right, Alex.
[02:19:23.487 --> 02:19:28.351]  Well, and by the way, I don't mind at all being delayed.
[02:19:28.711 --> 02:19:37.497]  What Tommy Robinson is doing is so critical, super important for our world, and that sounds like it's the most important story happening right now, so I'm glad you're on it.
[02:19:38.158 --> 02:19:42.681]  And I would just say to people, you know, multiple platforms.
[02:19:43.161 --> 02:19:49.646]  You know, take that trailer and post it to different platforms, you know, including Brighton, BitChute, and Rumble, and everywhere that you can.
[02:19:50.507 --> 02:19:55.588]  And, you know, we'll respect if Infowars wants us to take that down, we would respect that.
[02:19:55.668 --> 02:19:57.469]  But until then, let's get the word out.
[02:19:57.909 --> 02:20:03.250]  Let's help Tommy Robinson have a voice, because he's being gagged in silence as he's talking about.
[02:20:03.270 --> 02:20:04.711]  He's a very courageous individual.
[02:20:04.731 --> 02:20:06.451]  He has a crucial message for freedom.
[02:20:07.111 --> 02:20:07.931]  And God bless him.
[02:20:08.472 --> 02:20:09.712]  You know, God bless him.
[02:20:09.812 --> 02:20:13.753]  Prayers to Tommy Robinson for his safety and his work, because he's kind of like, it sounds like,
[02:20:14.406 --> 02:20:22.888]  For this project, he's doing the Project Veritas version of this in the UK, and the UK is such a police state!
[02:20:23.508 --> 02:20:43.173]  You know, the speech police and the vaccine passport police, it's so out of control, it's so tyrannical, and I feel so... I feel sorry for the people in the UK who are trying to retain their freedom, and I also feel blessed for what we have in places like Texas, where we have so much more freedom
[02:20:43.849 --> 02:20:47.192]  Because we're in a red state, you know, a red county and a red state.
[02:20:47.853 --> 02:20:56.662]  And we've got the Bill of Rights, the Constitution that still has elements remaining that haven't yet been completely destroyed by the Biden regime, which I know they're working on.
[02:20:57.283 --> 02:21:02.468]  But we still have the freedom to speak right here on this show, on this platform, InfoWars.com.
[02:21:03.317 --> 02:21:07.059]  And by God, we're going to exercise that freedom in the name of humanity.
[02:21:07.480 --> 02:21:08.540]  And that's what this is about.
[02:21:08.600 --> 02:21:16.825]  So so just a note to the producers there and for Alex, if there's something else breaking, obviously, you know, you could just just jump in and and go.
[02:21:16.865 --> 02:21:18.126]  I mean, it's your platform.
[02:21:18.166 --> 02:21:18.746]  It's your show.
[02:21:18.786 --> 02:21:22.589]  Until then, I'm going to bring you the information that I had planned for this segment.
[02:21:23.149 --> 02:21:24.550]  And and maybe it'll get interrupted.
[02:21:24.570 --> 02:21:26.811]  And that's totally fine, because this is reality.
[02:21:26.971 --> 02:21:27.952]  Reality is dynamic.
[02:21:28.232 --> 02:21:29.673]  We have to react to to events.
[02:21:29.713 --> 02:21:32.835]  And again, God bless Tommy Robinson and his work.
[02:21:33.829 --> 02:21:58.201]  What I've got for you coming up today, let's see, really in just a few minutes here, I've got a guest coming on, Bob Griswold, who is an expert in, well, so many things that have been happening around the world, and we're going to talk about the multi-layered collapse that's taking place and what you can do to help defend yourself against that collapse.
[02:22:00.939 --> 02:22:05.042]  You gotta understand there's a desperation on the part of the globalists.
[02:22:05.583 --> 02:22:10.206]  And the desperation is that they know that things are turning.
[02:22:10.726 --> 02:22:11.927]  There's an awakening.
[02:22:11.967 --> 02:22:13.008]  There's awareness now.
[02:22:13.108 --> 02:22:14.329]  Things are really turning.
[02:22:14.429 --> 02:22:18.392]  And by the way, I don't see the clock, so just let me know when we're going to break.
[02:22:18.632 --> 02:22:27.439]  But things are turning, and because of that, the globalists are extremely desperate to cover their tracks, which means they're going to release as many
[02:22:28.166 --> 02:22:31.688]  Terrorism events against humanity as they can manage.
[02:22:31.728 --> 02:22:35.451]  There are financial terrorism events that they are engineering.
[02:22:35.471 --> 02:22:37.852]  There's food scarcity that they are engineering.
[02:22:38.253 --> 02:22:41.995]  There's probably a grid-down scenario, at least regionally, that's being planned.
[02:22:42.476 --> 02:22:47.959]  And many other scenarios, maybe World War III, maybe UN occupation of America at some point.
[02:22:48.439 --> 02:22:53.403]  They're planning so many things, more bioweapons, more vaccines containing
[02:22:54.183 --> 02:22:59.888]  A nanotech weaponized systems to exterminate as many human beings as they can.
[02:23:00.188 --> 02:23:04.091]  So they know they're going to get caught, and that's the good news in all of this.
[02:23:04.151 --> 02:23:13.398]  They know they're going down eventually, but the bad news is they're going to unleash every form of terrorism against humanity between now and then in order to try to cover their tracks.
[02:23:13.939 --> 02:23:17.721]  So we are living through the best of times and the worst of times.
[02:23:18.362 --> 02:23:19.943]  As the novel says, things are going to be
[02:23:21.534 --> 02:23:23.936]  As bad or worse as anything you've ever experienced in your life.
[02:23:24.637 --> 02:23:31.543]  But if we survive that, then we earn the right to be here to witness what happens on the other side of this.
[02:23:32.183 --> 02:23:44.874]  And on the other side of this, we're going to see the indictment and the imprisoning of these criminals against humanity, who are demonic, demon-possessed criminals and destroyers of worlds.
[02:23:45.295 --> 02:23:46.676]  They're trying to destroy our civilization.
[02:23:46.716 --> 02:23:47.537]  They're going down.
[02:23:48.157 --> 02:23:48.938]  They're going down.
[02:23:49.818 --> 02:23:50.558]  Humanity wins.
[02:23:50.798 --> 02:23:51.358]  God wins.
[02:23:51.499 --> 02:23:56.940]  We win in the end, but there are tribulations between here and there that we've got to get through.
[02:23:57.460 --> 02:24:11.404]  So coming up after this break, we're going to have Bob Griswold joining us to talk about how we prepare ourselves for that survival, how we get through all of this, and what knowledge, wisdom, and maybe some tools that we need to make it through all of that.
[02:24:11.524 --> 02:24:13.325]  I'm Mike Adams here on InfoWars.com.
[02:24:13.705 --> 02:24:14.105]  Stay with us.
[02:24:14.125 --> 02:24:17.206]  We'll be right back after this break with that interview with Bob Griswold.
[02:24:18.908 --> 02:24:22.556]  All right, you're watching the Alex Jones Show on Infowars.com.
[02:24:22.596 --> 02:24:29.652]  I'm Mike Adams, filling in for the rest of this hour, and I've got a special guest for you that's going to bring some analysis and insight into the severity
[02:24:30.368 --> 02:24:48.952]  Of the collapse and chaos situation we're now facing because globalists are trying to distract us from their murderous crimes of building biological weapons and unleashing them against humanity in the form of COVID and also of course COVID vaccines which are also weaponized to cause mass extermination.
[02:24:50.066 --> 02:24:53.188]  We're going to have our work cut out for us to survive all of this.
[02:24:53.208 --> 02:24:57.170]  We're going to bring on now Bob Griswold from ReadyMadeResources.com.
[02:24:57.210 --> 02:24:59.292]  And Bob is a trusted analyst.
[02:24:59.312 --> 02:25:04.135]  He's got a lot of important opinions and experience in these areas on an international scope.
[02:25:04.435 --> 02:25:05.956]  Bob, welcome to the show.
[02:25:05.996 --> 02:25:06.877]  It's great to have you on.
[02:25:06.897 --> 02:25:07.477]  How are you doing today?
[02:25:08.599 --> 02:25:09.280]  I'm doing well, Mike.
[02:25:09.340 --> 02:25:10.942]  Thank you so much for having me here.
[02:25:11.202 --> 02:25:14.145]  You know, even as you were talking, I'm looking at a news report right now.
[02:25:14.605 --> 02:25:26.358]  It says widespread internet outage, brief disruptions of retail, financial travel, websites down, DNS failure, fixed question mark, 9-11 outages reported along East Coast.
[02:25:26.978 --> 02:25:28.499]  This isn't going to stop, Mike.
[02:25:28.799 --> 02:25:40.106]  And what my concern is this, is that people read this, China and what they're doing, the vaccine and what they're doing, the moral breakdown of society, what's happening there.
[02:25:40.626 --> 02:25:45.970]  And people can get so overwhelmed with what you would call raw intelligence.
[02:25:45.990 --> 02:25:47.030]  We read it every day.
[02:25:48.071 --> 02:25:49.332]  You and I read it every day.
[02:25:49.712 --> 02:25:54.715]  But at the end of the day, you have to take that raw intelligence and make a product
[02:25:55.196 --> 02:25:55.416]  I'm good.
[02:26:05.103 --> 02:26:08.505]  Some people do something, some people do the wrong things.
[02:26:08.945 --> 02:26:30.315]  The real key is taking this information that we see every day, the moral breakdown, the vaccines, the pushing of more lockdowns coming on the United States, these shutdowns, these cyber hackings that we see shutting down gasoline, meat, whatever, it goes all out the economy, this massive infusion of debt spending chasing
[02:26:34.718 --> 02:26:41.503]  Let's talk about what you just said.
[02:26:42.183 --> 02:26:52.291]  Mitch McConnell, Senate Minority Leader, just came out, I think it was this morning, or perhaps yesterday, but he said that if people don't get the shots, then we're going back into lockdowns.
[02:26:52.771 --> 02:26:54.891]  So this is a GOP leader of the Senate.
[02:26:54.911 --> 02:27:01.553]  Basically, I mean, it sounds a lot like a like a threat, like, hey, you better get vaccinated or we're going to punish you.
[02:27:01.593 --> 02:27:05.873]  We're going to make you a slave in your own home or a prisoner in your own home.
[02:27:06.394 --> 02:27:13.235]  And then they're going to systematically destroy the economy with a universal basic income payments to these people to get the culture used to not working.
[02:27:13.275 --> 02:27:15.435]  But my question to you, I mean, you know all this.
[02:27:15.455 --> 02:27:16.535]  The listeners know all this.
[02:27:17.196 --> 02:27:19.196]  How bad are things
[02:27:20.285 --> 02:27:31.959]  Going to get if they succeed in all their plans of all the lockdowns and the economic destruction because people don't know you've seen things overseas that would give people nightmares.
[02:27:31.979 --> 02:27:33.081]  You've seen collapse.
[02:27:33.201 --> 02:27:34.042]  What does it look like?
[02:27:34.062 --> 02:27:34.783]  What do you think's coming?
[02:27:36.498 --> 02:27:38.340]  Well, what it looks like is very unpleasant.
[02:27:38.400 --> 02:27:44.125]  People will sell things that they'd never even think they'd sell, including family members.
[02:27:45.586 --> 02:27:48.909]  Anything you have to put food on your table, people will do.
[02:27:48.929 --> 02:27:51.030]  I've seen it.
[02:27:52.091 --> 02:27:53.553]  It's very unpleasant to think about.
[02:27:54.613 --> 02:28:03.818]  You know, where you have a mother offering you a young child for a certain amount of money, and you can basically do with that child as you want.
[02:28:04.298 --> 02:28:15.624]  Now, we think that offends our sensibilities so much that we'd never do it here, but in this country today, millions of children have to sell themselves in one way or another just to meet basic necessities.
[02:28:15.984 --> 02:28:17.965]  We just try to put it out of sight.
[02:28:18.485 --> 02:28:19.646]  And this is what I was saying.
[02:28:20.446 --> 02:28:32.772]  Americans right now, those watching this program, watching your program, and other people like that, need to take this information and decide, how do I use this to benefit my family?
[02:28:32.832 --> 02:28:33.853]  Because that's the real thing.
[02:28:34.293 --> 02:28:40.576]  If you do not take this information now and do have a plan that's going to, you know,
[02:28:41.601 --> 02:28:42.321]  The Georgia Guide stuff.
[02:28:57.628 --> 02:28:58.588]  We've got millions.
[02:29:20.632 --> 02:29:25.177]  Well, sorry to interrupt, but tens of millions of Americans are oblivious to what's happening.
[02:29:25.237 --> 02:29:26.319]  Mostly people on the left.
[02:29:26.779 --> 02:29:28.261]  They're taking the vaccine shots.
[02:29:28.281 --> 02:29:29.963]  They don't know that they're not really vaccines.
[02:29:30.043 --> 02:29:32.726]  It's gene therapy, you know, maybe transhumanism tech.
[02:29:33.407 --> 02:29:35.149]  It's hard to say exactly what the outcome is going to be.
[02:29:35.529 --> 02:29:39.374]  But they think the economy is going to get back to normal if just everybody would take the shot.
[02:29:40.217 --> 02:29:48.445]  They think that Biden is somehow good for America when he's allowing hundreds of thousands of illegals to invade the southern border every month now, month after month.
[02:29:48.846 --> 02:29:51.668]  I mean, they're living in an oblivious fake reality.
[02:29:52.289 --> 02:29:52.970]  Bob, isn't it true?
[02:29:53.030 --> 02:29:59.216]  Their cities will collapse if this is allowed to continue and their cities will become death traps.
[02:29:59.276 --> 02:30:00.397]  They will kill themselves.
[02:30:01.598 --> 02:30:02.879]  Yeah, their cities are collapsing.
[02:30:03.159 --> 02:30:06.822]  I mean, it doesn't, all you have to do is just look at history right now.
[02:30:07.162 --> 02:30:08.643]  History, what did Mark Twain say?
[02:30:08.683 --> 02:30:10.345]  It doesn't repeat, but it sure does rhyme.
[02:30:10.725 --> 02:30:17.310]  I mean, we are looking at just a massive infusion of fake money into this economy right now.
[02:30:18.391 --> 02:30:23.034]  Half the money in the economy right now was added within the last year.
[02:30:23.334 --> 02:30:23.875]  Think of that.
[02:30:24.395 --> 02:30:28.136]  Half of it that's floating around the economy was added in the last year.
[02:30:28.196 --> 02:30:37.158]  And at the same time, on top of that, we've had a major disruption in shipping, trucking, and all the manner of delivery of goods.
[02:30:37.298 --> 02:30:40.698]  I mean, right now, I have a desk right here that I have in my new office.
[02:30:41.079 --> 02:30:43.579]  It took me six months to get this desk.
[02:30:43.819 --> 02:30:47.920]  I ordered it and they told me a month, but it's six months later, it finally showed up.
[02:30:48.760 --> 02:30:49.960]  That's what you're looking at.
[02:30:50.020 --> 02:30:52.101]  And so we have all this money right now.
[02:30:53.161 --> 02:30:54.302]  You're in a commercial business.
[02:30:54.582 --> 02:30:55.323]  I'm in a commercial business.
[02:30:55.363 --> 02:30:56.444]  Alex Jones is in a commercial business.
[02:31:10.342 --> 02:31:12.103]  All three of us see the same thing.
[02:31:12.123 --> 02:31:15.686]  And I want you to describe what are you seeing with commercial supply lines?
[02:31:15.706 --> 02:31:19.028]  Because I'm seeing a collapse in commercial quantities of food.
[02:31:19.469 --> 02:31:21.910]  You know, like we buy millions of pounds of food a year and so on.
[02:31:22.311 --> 02:31:23.211]  It's collapsing.
[02:31:23.532 --> 02:31:27.695]  They're telling us they can't guarantee food after 90 days from July 1st, by the way.
[02:31:27.935 --> 02:31:28.795]  What are you seeing?
[02:31:28.815 --> 02:31:32.878]  Because you're in a different business, you know, like night vision and stuff like that.
[02:31:33.078 --> 02:31:33.719]  What are you seeing?
[02:31:34.753 --> 02:31:35.133]  Chicken.
[02:31:35.734 --> 02:31:38.755]  That's one meat right now that's becoming scarcer and scarcer.
[02:31:39.115 --> 02:31:42.337]  All you have to do is look at what the big companies are doing right now.
[02:31:42.717 --> 02:31:46.299]  Supermarkets are stocking up more than they normally do.
[02:31:47.379 --> 02:31:52.522]  Fast food restaurants, you see them stocking up extra food because they know a shortage is coming.
[02:31:52.762 --> 02:31:53.682]  We can ignore that.
[02:31:53.762 --> 02:31:58.585]  You can ignore that data point and say, well, it'll always be there because it's always been there.
[02:31:59.005 --> 02:32:03.489]  But what's going to happen when all of a sudden you don't have your vaccine passport?
[02:32:03.929 --> 02:32:05.110]  You don't have the money?
[02:32:05.390 --> 02:32:10.875]  Because all you know, your $10 that used to buy a pound of chicken, now it's $50 and you can't buy it.
[02:32:11.896 --> 02:32:13.557]  All these things are coming into play.
[02:32:13.577 --> 02:32:19.442]  So the question is not really to just address the issues, but how do you fix it?
[02:32:19.702 --> 02:32:21.343]  And there's only one way to fix it right now.
[02:32:21.624 --> 02:32:26.648]  The money that you have, realize that in six months, it's going to be worth maybe half of what it's worth right now.
[02:32:27.448 --> 02:32:50.587]  And if you don't take that money and put it into goods and tangibles that your family needs, in six months from now, instead of buying a pound of chicken, you'll buy a half a pound with the same amount of money, and all of a sudden your savings and all that is depreciated, and you'll be working harder and harder for less and less, and at the same time, many Americans won't be able to do it, and they'll just get sick and die.
[02:32:50.668 --> 02:32:51.869]  I mean, that's what's gonna happen.
[02:32:52.972 --> 02:32:59.217]  We've already entered essentially hyperinflation, at least in the food sector, because that I mean, that's beyond the definition of hyperinflation.
[02:32:59.237 --> 02:32:59.997]  And I think you're right.
[02:33:00.017 --> 02:33:03.820]  Yeah, I mean, just well, lumber prices.
[02:33:05.541 --> 02:33:10.545]  Well, yeah, and then copper, aluminum, steel, try to build a steel building these days.
[02:33:10.585 --> 02:33:12.426]  But look, Bob, we're going to go to break here shortly.
[02:33:12.727 --> 02:33:12.847]  And
[02:33:14.104 --> 02:33:16.367]  We're going to have you continue with us on the other side of that.
[02:33:16.827 --> 02:33:26.499]  But I want to specifically help people address this issue of when they understand what we're talking about, but they have a family member who doesn't get it.
[02:33:26.880 --> 02:33:32.507]  How do you wake up a family member so that they can get prepared for what's coming and you don't end up committing, you know,
[02:33:33.167 --> 02:33:34.728]  A lack of preparedness suicide.
[02:33:34.748 --> 02:33:36.529]  So we're going to talk about that when we come back.
[02:33:36.589 --> 02:33:37.329]  I'm Mike Adams here.
[02:33:37.370 --> 02:33:41.252]  This is the Alex Jones Show, the fourth hour today, and we're talking with Bob Griswold.
[02:33:41.272 --> 02:33:42.913]  So stay with us after this break.
[02:33:42.953 --> 02:33:46.314]  We'll be right back with more on this topic to help you stay alive.
[02:33:47.235 --> 02:33:47.955]  All right, welcome back.
[02:33:48.015 --> 02:33:50.277]  This is Mike Adams, the Health Ranger here.
[02:33:50.297 --> 02:33:53.739]  This is the Alex Jones Show on InfoWars.com.
[02:33:53.779 --> 02:33:55.460]  I'm the publisher of NaturalNews.com.
[02:33:55.480 --> 02:33:56.040]  We've got a guest.
[02:33:56.721 --> 02:34:00.185]  With us for this segment, Bob Griswold from ReadyMade Resources.
[02:34:00.265 --> 02:34:01.546]  But real quick, just a comment.
[02:34:02.447 --> 02:34:11.216]  I don't know what you saw during the break, but I saw, you know, an ad, Alex and Mike Lindell getting together commercially with MyPillow.
[02:34:11.637 --> 02:34:12.898]  And I think it's awesome.
[02:34:13.259 --> 02:34:15.941]  Mike Lindell really walks his talk.
[02:34:16.322 --> 02:34:19.185]  And folks, if you want this country to survive,
[02:34:19.785 --> 02:34:20.745]  All of what's coming.
[02:34:21.365 --> 02:34:30.568]  It's absolutely crucial to vote with your consumer dollars for those platforms and those individuals who are fighting for America.
[02:34:31.008 --> 02:34:39.010]  And it's MyPillow.com and use promo code Alex and you'll be supporting both InfoWars as well as Mike Lindell's operation.
[02:34:39.070 --> 02:34:43.411]  So MyPillow.com promo code Alex for great discounts.
[02:34:43.711 --> 02:34:46.111]  I'm gonna get some towels and pillowcases myself, by the way.
[02:34:46.611 --> 02:34:49.212]  So getting back to our topic of this segment,
[02:34:49.878 --> 02:34:50.038]  I think?
[02:35:05.410 --> 02:35:10.374]  You're very likely to not survive what's coming, especially if the financial collapse unfolds as we think it may.
[02:35:10.394 --> 02:35:16.218]  I mean, people are going to be wiped out and destitute, literally overnight, going to wake up with dollars worthless.
[02:35:17.139 --> 02:35:26.646]  How can people, I mean, because you've been successful at this in many cases, how can people talk to those who are zombified and awaken them to the reality of what's happening?
[02:35:27.679 --> 02:35:29.280]  Well, sometimes you can't talk to him, Mike.
[02:35:29.320 --> 02:35:30.081]  Sometimes you can.
[02:35:30.101 --> 02:35:31.842]  And you have to make that determination.
[02:35:32.202 --> 02:35:37.306]  You know, if you're a mother and you have a husband who's not into it, you have to look at your children and say, what am I going to do?
[02:35:37.686 --> 02:35:43.430]  I have to take something and you're going to have to understand I'm going to set food aside as much as I can.
[02:35:43.491 --> 02:35:48.834]  If you're a husband and it's vice versa, you have a bigger picture than just yourself.
[02:35:49.095 --> 02:35:52.637]  We have children, we have family, and we need to make sure we can take care of them.
[02:35:52.657 --> 02:35:55.039]  You know, I always I love history.
[02:35:55.379 --> 02:35:57.101]  I always challenge people historically.
[02:35:57.461 --> 02:36:04.849]  Show me a case, a situation where a nation's doing what we're doing that has not ended in absolute disaster and lots of body bags.
[02:36:05.069 --> 02:36:11.015]  You know, in the Black Book of Communism, it says one thing godless states have in common is a lot of body bags.
[02:36:11.275 --> 02:36:13.837]  Well, America is headed to that situation.
[02:36:14.157 --> 02:36:23.983]  I mean, you throw on top of it, you know, these planned outages, these planned shortages, the planned vaccine cards where you won't be able to access your money or food without your vaccine card.
[02:36:24.364 --> 02:36:26.525]  But you also look what's happening out west right now.
[02:36:26.845 --> 02:36:32.089]  The severe, catastrophic, 1,000-year drought, locusts eating food.
[02:36:32.489 --> 02:36:35.011]  I mean, it's at our door.
[02:36:35.272 --> 02:36:43.039]  So the thing again, what Americans need to do right now, our brothers and sisters that are listening to this program, you need to go out and make a list.
[02:36:43.199 --> 02:36:48.464]  You need to take some hard time, make a list of what your family needs, and then start accumulating it.
[02:36:48.684 --> 02:36:52.988]  Because every day that goes by, I can promise you that dollar is worth less and less.
[02:36:53.348 --> 02:37:06.160]  You're going to see smaller packaging, you're going to see rationing, you're going to see products unavailable, and eventually you won't be able to get it at all because it'll be for the elite and they will starve you into death is what they'll do.
[02:37:09.532 --> 02:37:10.433]  I like church history.
[02:37:11.133 --> 02:37:17.618]  There's a church father from about 200 AD, Hippolytus, and I was talking to Steve about him the other day.
[02:37:17.638 --> 02:37:29.147]  In 200 AD, he wrote that this evil system at the end, the Antichrist system, would use food as a coercion mechanism to make you take his mark.
[02:37:29.508 --> 02:37:33.871]  I mean, it's in the history of the church that they actually said that.
[02:37:33.931 --> 02:37:37.374]  They will use food to coerce you into taking the mark.
[02:37:37.754 --> 02:37:38.275]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:38:00.086 --> 02:38:12.857]  It took me a long time to get over some of the things I saw, but you will be willing to trade anything you have, your person, your body, anything, no matter how degrading it will be, for a little food.
[02:38:13.457 --> 02:38:14.518]  Why would you want to be there?
[02:38:15.839 --> 02:38:21.981]  No, and I would say to those to those watching, because we haven't gone into your full background, I'm not even sure you can talk about some of it.
[02:38:22.022 --> 02:38:35.647]  But the point is, you have seen more than enough that makes you a Christian man and a patriot American, because you do not want to see those things happen in this country, because you know what a nightmare it is.
[02:38:35.727 --> 02:38:38.748]  And people can just probably connect the dots on on some of that.
[02:38:38.808 --> 02:38:40.569]  But let me let me ask you this, Bob.
[02:38:41.169 --> 02:38:45.491]  In the last two weeks, I've had high level people reach out to me and I'm talking from the world of finance.
[02:38:46.289 --> 02:38:48.329]  Like, billionaire people.
[02:38:49.350 --> 02:38:51.410]  Not the couple that you and I both know.
[02:38:51.430 --> 02:38:52.150]  I'm not talking about them.
[02:38:52.330 --> 02:39:02.933]  I'm talking about people in, like, global billionaires in finance reach out to me to say, hey, I just realized that you were right about all this stuff.
[02:39:03.453 --> 02:39:11.094]  And they would say, I know all about finance and I don't know anything about rural living or preparedness or firearms or self-defense or anything.
[02:39:11.134 --> 02:39:11.895]  Where do I begin?
[02:39:12.315 --> 02:39:13.855]  And I'm thinking, where do you begin?
[02:39:14.659 --> 02:39:16.500]  Dude, the hour is late!
[02:39:17.261 --> 02:39:18.822]  You know how late you are to this game?
[02:39:19.222 --> 02:39:22.785]  What can people do if they're just waking up now?
[02:39:22.805 --> 02:39:24.586]  How can they even begin to prepare now?
[02:39:28.550 --> 02:39:30.251]  Well, common sense will tell you a lot of it.
[02:39:30.272 --> 02:39:31.693]  I mean, you know, you have to eat every day.
[02:39:31.993 --> 02:39:33.594]  You know, you have to drink water every day.
[02:39:33.634 --> 02:39:36.377]  You know, they're becoming more and more of a violent society every day.
[02:39:36.397 --> 02:39:40.300]  I mean, it doesn't take a brilliant person to address those issues.
[02:39:40.660 --> 02:39:48.467]  I mean, just to start having food aside in your home, water or the ability to purify water or water in your home and the ability to protect yourself.
[02:39:48.727 --> 02:39:50.349]  Those are pretty simple issues to do.
[02:39:50.409 --> 02:39:51.930]  I know you guys with the satellite phones.
[02:39:52.330 --> 02:40:00.192]  Being able to talk, I mean nothing is worse than having a loved one away from the house when a disaster happens and you can't contact them.
[02:40:00.452 --> 02:40:02.692]  So you don't know where they're at, you don't know what's happened to them.
[02:40:02.972 --> 02:40:07.113]  So communication, you know, it's one of my things I hold dear and near to my heart.
[02:40:07.333 --> 02:40:13.455]  The ability to communicate, be able to listen, to be able to receive data, give data, that's near and dear to my heart.
[02:40:13.715 --> 02:40:18.336]  If you've waited this long before you've done anything, you better hire an expert right
[02:40:18.336 --> 02:40:28.220]  Right now if you've got that kind of money and you better have somebody start putting you on the fast lane and start acquiring stuff at breakneck speed because it is not going to be available.
[02:40:28.680 --> 02:40:31.742]  We always think well if I have enough money I can buy anything.
[02:40:31.982 --> 02:40:34.343]  Well when it's not available it's not available.
[02:40:34.483 --> 02:40:36.664]  Your money will not save you at any point.
[02:40:36.924 --> 02:40:38.044]  It's going to be worthless.
[02:40:38.244 --> 02:40:41.586]  You're going to throw it in the street because it's going to be worthless but the person who has
[02:40:42.126 --> 02:40:42.727]  I've seen that.
[02:40:59.409 --> 02:41:00.329]  Mommy, I'm hungry!
[02:41:00.370 --> 02:41:01.610]  That's not a fun thing to hear!
[02:41:02.030 --> 02:41:28.082]  And so, if you don't act upon it, you're going to hear that one form or another, and it's going to wrench your heart out, because you could have done something while you had time to do it, and you wasted the time, you pittered it away with whatever, watching some stupid football game, or spending money on something you didn't need to spend it on, when all along, the signs of what's happening are historic, they've happened before, they're happening again, and if you ignore them, you will die.
[02:41:28.562 --> 02:41:28.862]  Period.
[02:41:30.030 --> 02:41:32.692]  And all the money in the world, like you said, can't save you.
[02:41:32.732 --> 02:41:38.377]  You know, Elon Musk reportedly recently bought quite a bit of acreage in Central Texas.
[02:41:38.797 --> 02:41:42.200]  And as you know, the Infowars operation is in Central Texas.
[02:41:42.740 --> 02:41:44.281]  My operation's in Central Texas.
[02:41:44.301 --> 02:41:47.504]  Now, Elon Musk is in Central Texas.
[02:41:47.684 --> 02:41:51.847]  And I was thinking, someone asked me about this the other day, what do you think about that?
[02:41:51.867 --> 02:41:52.628]  And I said, you know what?
[02:41:52.928 --> 02:41:55.210]  Elon Musk doesn't have what I have.
[02:41:56.164 --> 02:41:58.005]  Because I've been prepping for 20 years.
[02:41:58.065 --> 02:42:03.449]  Elon Musk, all the money in the world, I would not trade my situation for his situation.
[02:42:03.469 --> 02:42:05.070]  I don't care if he's got rocket ships to Mars.
[02:42:05.751 --> 02:42:15.017]  You know, I want to survive here on Earth, and I've got knowledge, know-how, preps, gear, community people, radio, you know, comms, frequencies, everything.
[02:42:15.097 --> 02:42:16.799]  Elon Musk, he doesn't have that stuff.
[02:42:16.859 --> 02:42:19.581]  If the dollar crashes, his wealth vanishes.
[02:42:19.681 --> 02:42:21.122]  His whole operation vanishes.
[02:42:21.882 --> 02:42:25.685]  And at the end of the day, you need food, water, self-defense, all that stuff.
[02:42:26.773 --> 02:42:28.735]  Is Bitcoin worth just a few months ago?
[02:42:29.075 --> 02:42:30.016]  It's cut in half now.
[02:42:30.036 --> 02:42:30.296]  Right.
[02:42:30.316 --> 02:42:32.918]  I mean, people lost half their wealth overnight.
[02:42:32.998 --> 02:42:36.440]  It just disappeared because at the end, it really, really wasn't wealth.
[02:42:36.681 --> 02:42:38.662]  You know, they say all wealth comes from the earth.
[02:42:38.962 --> 02:42:41.404]  So if it didn't come out of the earth, it's probably not real wealth.
[02:42:41.644 --> 02:42:47.969]  And, you know, Mike, you hit a big key experience and knowledge, you know, that you're under you're under a real.
[02:42:49.350 --> 02:43:11.505]  Deadline here, because if you've not gained that experience and knowledge of knowing how to, I mean, whether it's from gardening, how to shoot a gun, how to move tactically, how to use a radio, any of those things, which people who've been prepping a long time have applied those disciplines and learned those disciplines in their life, you know, from going to garden to shooting a gun to whatever, you can't buy that.
[02:43:11.805 --> 02:43:12.706]  You can't buy it.
[02:43:12.926 --> 02:43:16.188]  I mean, you can't buy the experience of going through boot camp.
[02:43:16.989 --> 02:43:19.131]  Or BUDS training, maybe CEO BUDS training.
[02:43:19.371 --> 02:43:25.257]  You could have 20 million dollars and say I'll give you 20 million dollars just you know give me a certificate so I know all this stuff.
[02:43:25.577 --> 02:43:27.900]  That doesn't work if you haven't gone through those.
[02:43:30.342 --> 02:43:31.543]  Yeah, I'm sorry to interrupt you.
[02:43:31.583 --> 02:43:32.384]  We're out of time.
[02:43:32.404 --> 02:43:33.845]  We're going to wrap this up, but you're exactly right.
[02:43:34.205 --> 02:43:37.047]  Experience counts, and you can't buy it.
[02:43:37.187 --> 02:43:38.008]  You have to earn it.
[02:43:38.368 --> 02:43:39.589]  You've got to go through the training.
[02:43:40.169 --> 02:43:51.037]  I remember going through emergency medic training, stuffing gauze into wounds on dummy humans while there's live rifle fire, and putting on tourniquets with one hand.
[02:43:51.678 --> 02:43:53.179]  Yeah, you can't buy that experience.
[02:43:53.219 --> 02:43:53.800]  You've got to earn it.
[02:43:54.100 --> 02:43:56.081]  But folks, take this seriously.
[02:43:56.321 --> 02:43:57.762]  And Bob, thank you for joining us today.
[02:43:57.843 --> 02:43:59.644]  ReadyMadeResources.com is your website.
[02:44:00.325 --> 02:44:04.192]  This is Mike Adams here filling in for, well, I'm not sure who's the regular host today.
[02:44:04.212 --> 02:44:06.015]  This is the fourth hour, Alex Jones Show.
[02:44:06.115 --> 02:44:07.036]  Infowars.com.
[02:44:07.056 --> 02:44:07.597]  Spread the word.
[02:44:08.038 --> 02:44:08.539]  Stay free.
[02:44:08.860 --> 02:44:09.441]  Thanks for watching.
[02:44:16.209 --> 02:44:24.496]  Listen folks, I cannot fund this operation without your support, and you've been great, and you've kept us on air, and you've gotten great products, and you've bought them again and again and again.
[02:44:24.937 --> 02:44:30.382]  But so many of our products have been sold out for two months, five months, six months, eight months, because of the supply chain breakdowns.
[02:44:30.842 --> 02:44:37.948]  So I really appreciate you helping with our shortfalls, buying books, buying films, buying t-shirts, and infowarestore.com.
[02:44:38.249 --> 02:44:42.853]  I just met with my accountants on Friday, and we're barely in the black.
[02:44:43.413 --> 02:44:44.013]  But you know what?
[02:44:44.133 --> 02:44:54.757]  Knowing what's going on in this world, and how the time is short, as the old devil knows, and they're accelerating their operation against us, and God, I need to expand, not just stay the same size.
[02:44:54.817 --> 02:45:01.699]  So, please understand we've got great products that you and your family need, and that your funding makes all this possible.
[02:45:02.239 --> 02:45:05.100]  Now, for several years, I wanted to get one of these in, and now we've done it.
[02:45:05.740 --> 02:45:06.781]  It's the highest rated.
[02:45:07.082 --> 02:45:14.832]  There are a lot of great super greens out there that are just made up of concentrated ground up cabbage and things like that.
[02:45:15.653 --> 02:45:19.217]  Those are great for getting extra roughage through your body.
[02:45:19.658 --> 02:45:21.880]  But this is a high end product.
[02:45:22.441 --> 02:45:27.883]  Green fiber capsules that comes from the very, very best products.
[02:45:27.903 --> 02:45:28.804]  Let me tell you what's in it.
[02:45:29.204 --> 02:45:38.367]  Introducing organic greens fiber caps, total amino acid supercharger, give your gut a reboot and a new lease on life.
[02:45:38.927 --> 02:45:42.309]  It's no secret that our unhealthy modern diets are slowly killing us.
[02:45:42.669 --> 02:45:49.712]  Most people are eating highly processed foods that are lacking high quality antioxidants, vitamins, enzymes,
[02:45:50.794 --> 02:45:50.994]  I think?
[02:46:09.969 --> 02:46:15.631]  It's made with seven organic greens that contain natural enzymes, that's key, for healthy digestion.
[02:46:15.651 --> 02:46:21.473]  Just one serving of the new Greens Fiber Caps contains as much fiber as three cups of iceberg lettuce.
[02:46:21.513 --> 02:46:23.494]  But again, fiber is just one thing.
[02:46:24.574 --> 02:46:32.637]  It's the type of fiber from wheatgrass, flax sprouts, and a bunch of others that have all the antioxidants, all the amino acids, everything.
[02:46:33.686 --> 02:46:36.029]  It's an excellent source of many different vitamins and minerals.
[02:46:36.189 --> 02:46:38.311]  Of its 17 amino acids, 8 are essential.
[02:46:39.012 --> 02:46:43.156]  Meaning, your body cannot produce them and you must obtain them from food sources.
[02:46:43.437 --> 02:46:45.419]  That's the concentrated wheatgrass.
[02:46:45.939 --> 02:46:49.403]  Flax sprouts are an excellent source of antioxidants.
[02:46:49.523 --> 02:46:52.666]  Vitamins A, B, C, E and all the essential amino acids.
[02:46:53.007 --> 02:46:54.448]  Calcium, magnesium, iron.
[02:46:55.842 --> 02:46:58.044]  Niacin, phosphorus, and potassium.
[02:46:58.064 --> 02:47:01.387]  This is the highest in product you're going to get in a green capsule.
[02:47:02.188 --> 02:47:04.850]  This formula is loaded with five greens.
[02:47:05.010 --> 02:47:12.657]  Organic pea fiber, organic alfalfa leaf, organic cilantro leaf, organic kale leaf, organic... I always say that wrong.
[02:47:12.677 --> 02:47:13.178]  How do you say it?
[02:47:14.557 --> 02:47:16.219]  Keen Wham, I stand on it right, sprout.
[02:47:16.900 --> 02:47:19.363]  This is a high-end green fiber formula.
[02:47:19.763 --> 02:47:27.192]  Most brands derive their green fiber from the most inexpensive sources like processed lettuce, almost devoid of other nutrients.
[02:47:27.452 --> 02:47:31.857]  This formula is derived from high-quality nutrient-dense plants like wheatgrass and sprouts.
[02:47:32.237 --> 02:47:34.920]  Get the new organic green fiber caps now.
[02:47:35.481 --> 02:47:35.921]  I think so.
[02:47:50.894 --> 02:47:55.439]  And so much more at InfoWarsTore.com and that finances our operation.
[02:47:55.899 --> 02:48:00.103]  So in these insane times when more folks are listening than ever, InfoWars is a stay on the air.
[02:48:00.404 --> 02:48:01.665]  So it's a symbiotic relationship.
[02:48:01.705 --> 02:48:13.497]  Get amazing immune system boosting products like Winter Sun and this new product, Green Fiber, at InfoWarsTore.com with big discounts and fund the future of the pro-human revolution.
[02:48:13.697 --> 02:48:15.699]  Well, it happened last week, right after July 4th.
[02:48:16.159 --> 02:48:20.422]  World leaders across the planet and the UN announced a new world order.
[02:48:20.983 --> 02:48:23.665]  Global government to stop the spread of COVID.
[02:48:23.845 --> 02:48:31.071]  Oh, and they're going to have to surveil all your text messages on your private phone and censor them if you question Fauci and the UN.
[02:48:31.111 --> 02:48:31.611]  That's because
[02:48:32.412 --> 02:48:33.793]  These criminals are going to go to prison.
[02:48:34.013 --> 02:48:35.053]  They released the virus.
[02:48:35.513 --> 02:48:37.594]  They have used the whole program to starve the third world.
[02:48:37.934 --> 02:48:46.778]  And they're now bringing in a worldwide ID, in Klaus Schwab's own words, with an implantable microchip as the next phase to be able to buy and sell or travel.
[02:48:47.338 --> 02:48:49.739]  So whether you believe the Bible or not, the Mark of the Beast is here.
[02:48:49.979 --> 02:48:51.740]  And our mission is now more important than ever.
[02:48:52.020 --> 02:48:53.941]  We make it easy to support InfoWars.
[02:48:54.381 --> 02:49:00.503]  One of our best sellers has been X2 Deep Earth Crystal Iodine that comes in two different packages.
[02:49:00.583 --> 02:49:02.604]  One with a spray bottle, one with a dropper bottle.
[02:49:02.964 --> 02:49:08.186]  It's both the exact same amount of iodine, it's the exact same bottle, it's just a different top.
[02:49:08.666 --> 02:49:17.049]  The spray bottle is selling out, but it's 60% off because I want those of you that have been big supporters to have it again, and I want those of you that have been on the fence to get it for yourself.
[02:49:17.430 --> 02:49:19.570]  And the dropper bottle is really close to selling out.
[02:49:19.970 --> 02:49:20.291]  It is 40% off.
[02:49:21.511 --> 02:49:21.791]  Thank you.
