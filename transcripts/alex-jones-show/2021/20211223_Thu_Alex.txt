[00:00:00.289 --> 00:00:11.276]  So let me just say again, the variants are not different enough to represent a threat to you, so you do not need to top up vaccines, yet they are being made and the regulators have more or less waved them through.
[00:00:12.711 --> 00:00:13.732]  I'm very frightened of that.
[00:00:14.213 --> 00:00:17.196]  There's no possible benign interpretation of this.
[00:00:18.818 --> 00:00:22.141]  I believe that they're going to be used to damage your health and possibly kill you.
[00:00:22.742 --> 00:00:23.222]  Seriously.
[00:00:23.583 --> 00:00:30.030]  I can see no sensible interpretation other than a serious attempt at mass depopulation.
[00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.670]  They're murdering you!
[00:00:32.131 --> 00:00:33.151]  Murdering you!
[00:00:33.611 --> 00:00:34.051]  Murder!
[00:00:34.491 --> 00:00:36.032]  Maybe folks won't listen to me when I call it murder.
[00:00:36.052 --> 00:00:37.032]  Maybe I go, Red Rum!
[00:00:37.312 --> 00:00:37.872]  Red Rum!
[00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:42.093]  You know who Barbara Marks Hubbard was?
[00:00:42.274 --> 00:00:42.654]  Yes.
[00:00:44.054 --> 00:00:46.855]  Okay, she is the demonic mother of the New World Order.
[00:00:47.495 --> 00:00:49.836]  She, uh, I hope she burns in hell for all eternity.
[00:00:50.476 --> 00:00:55.057]  She, um, and I'm gonna read you a few quotes from her that will explain to you the philosophy.
[00:00:55.417 --> 00:01:00.811]   She's the ideology The mother of the ideology of Klaus Schwab, let's say.
[00:01:02.152 --> 00:01:05.994]  One-fourth of humanity must be eliminated from the social body.
[00:01:06.014 --> 00:01:07.034]  It's a quote.
[00:01:07.655 --> 00:01:12.017]  We are in charge of God's selection process for planet Earth.
[00:01:12.637 --> 00:01:15.138]  He selects, we destroy.
[00:01:15.858 --> 00:01:19.580]  We are the riders of the pale horse death.
[00:01:20.701 --> 00:01:21.081]  End quote.
[00:01:21.421 --> 00:01:23.582]  Another quote from her.
[00:01:24.242 --> 00:01:27.704]  This act is as horrible as killing a cancer cell.
[00:01:28.419 --> 00:01:33.202]  It must be done for the sake of the future of the whole, so be it.
[00:01:33.823 --> 00:01:37.966]  Be prepared for the selection process, which is now beginning.
[00:01:38.186 --> 00:01:55.518]  We, the elders, have been patiently waiting until the very last moment before the quantum transformation to take action to cut out this corrupted and corrupting element in the body of humanity.
[00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:57.960]  It is like watching a cancer grow.
[00:01:58.616 --> 00:02:01.677]  Something must be done before the whole body is destroyed.
[00:02:02.318 --> 00:02:06.399]  The destructive one-fourth must be eliminated from the social body.
[00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:13.740]   From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:29.740]  [Music]
[00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.716]   InfoWars Tomorrow's news today.
[00:02:35.878 --> 00:02:43.765]  Also, you know, I'm watching the back stuff and I'm truly horrified by it on a real level and I've become totally intolerant of it.
[00:02:44.646 --> 00:02:45.286]  Because it's too much.
[00:02:45.306 --> 00:02:47.848]  And it's too cruel, it hurts too many people.
[00:02:50.851 --> 00:02:52.252]  Nobody wants to say this, but...
[00:02:53.732 --> 00:02:57.453]  You know, obviously it's class war against the weakest people.
[00:02:58.114 --> 00:03:00.855]  In the end, only Salvadoran busboys will have masks on.
[00:03:01.315 --> 00:03:03.316]  You know, because the peasants can't look at their leaders.
[00:03:03.336 --> 00:03:04.656]  Like, that's what it's actually about.
[00:03:05.296 --> 00:03:08.097]  And the VAC stuff is about punishing people who have no one to protect them.
[00:03:08.277 --> 00:03:08.798]  That's the truth.
[00:03:09.398 --> 00:03:09.658]  Okay?
[00:03:10.178 --> 00:03:11.299]  And I'm completely sick of it.
[00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:13.799]  And I'm going to soon be selling mugs that say, naturally immune.
[00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.840]  Because if you're naturally immune, you earned it.
[00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.742]  And... I mean that.
[00:03:21.522 --> 00:03:25.123]   And if you have earned it, And I know some in the room have.
[00:03:25.724 --> 00:03:26.545]  You know, you earned it.
[00:03:27.866 --> 00:03:30.850]  You know, and some people really earned it at high cost.
[00:03:32.071 --> 00:03:32.852]  And you should be proud of it.
[00:03:33.072 --> 00:03:38.058]  And you should let anybody make you feel bad about it, boss you around about it, make you do anything you don't want to do.
[00:03:38.098 --> 00:03:38.919]  So I look at that.
[00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:40.801]  I'm like, what is this?
[00:03:41.121 --> 00:03:42.823]  Both the president and I are vaxxed.
[00:03:42.943 --> 00:03:44.024]  And did you get the booster?
[00:03:45.123 --> 00:03:45.363]  Yes.
[00:03:45.664 --> 00:03:46.244]  I got it too.
[00:03:46.784 --> 00:03:50.287]  Okay, so, uh... Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, no, no.
[00:03:51.068 --> 00:03:52.810]  That's a very tiny group over there.
[00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.313]  So you heard some members of the crowd booing there, and this was at a pro-Trump event.
[00:03:57.474 --> 00:04:03.999]  And look, we've seen this at Trump rallies before, where his supporters are booing the fact that he is getting a booster or vaccine.
[00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:05.961]  I recommend take the vaccines!
[00:04:06.061 --> 00:04:07.982]  I did it, it's good, take the vaccines.
[00:04:08.062 --> 00:04:11.966]  But you got, no, that's okay, that's all right.
[00:04:11.986 --> 00:04:12.967]  You got your freedoms.
[00:04:13.647 --> 00:04:23.176]  This speaks to the exact problem here with which Americans to a large degree are still very resistant to getting these boosters or the vaccine in the first place.
[00:04:23.437 --> 00:04:30.423]  Hopefully his supporters let it sink in and go get boosted or go get that first vaccine now that they know the former president.
[00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:32.085]  It didn't sound like it there.
[00:04:32.145 --> 00:04:32.886]  They'd like to resist.
[00:04:33.086 --> 00:04:36.027]  They were booing him, which just doesn't make any sense.
[00:04:36.307 --> 00:04:42.789]  President Trump is very proud that his administration developed that vaccine.
[00:04:42.809 --> 00:04:43.629]  That's the bottom line.
[00:04:43.649 --> 00:04:46.150]  Well, look, and I think they should be.
[00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.611]  The vaccine has been proven to kill exactly zero.
[00:04:49.731 --> 00:04:56.093]  The Orange County Coroner's Office is investigating the death of a woman who passed away several days after getting her second Moderna vaccine.
[00:04:56.213 --> 00:05:00.634]  The Lisa Shaw died after complications of the AstraZeneca COVID vaccination.
[00:05:00.894 --> 00:05:02.895]  Today could be your lucky day.
[00:05:03.275 --> 00:05:06.556]  California's first vaccine lottery drawing takes place tonight.
[00:05:06.576 --> 00:05:08.636]  That's right, you could win one million dollars.
[00:05:08.716 --> 00:05:10.056]  You want to be part of the fun?
[00:05:10.076 --> 00:05:11.397]  Get vaccinated.
[00:05:11.477 --> 00:05:17.238]  Residents that have been vaccinated could receive incentives like free haircuts and even manicures.
[00:05:17.258 --> 00:05:20.159]  Did you say free fries when you get vaccinated?
[00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:21.599]  I got vaccinated.
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.960]  You're saying I could get this?
[00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.820]  Delicious fries.
[00:05:25.261 --> 00:05:27.621]  Joints for jabs, that's what they're calling it.
[00:05:27.781 --> 00:05:31.963]  Free joints today to those who could prove they got the COVID vaccine.
[00:05:32.023 --> 00:05:34.483]  There's also a burger element to this.
[00:05:35.664 --> 00:05:38.625]  You're not going to get COVID if you have these vaccinations.
[00:05:38.885 --> 00:05:42.966]  We're increasingly hearing about fully vaccinated people infected with COVID.
[00:05:42.986 --> 00:05:43.706]  Did you get the booster?
[00:05:43.987 --> 00:05:44.227]  Yes.
[00:05:44.527 --> 00:05:45.007]  I got it too.
[00:05:46.712 --> 00:05:48.372]  I don't care if you're Donald Trump.
[00:05:48.592 --> 00:05:49.833]  I don't care if you're Bill Gates.
[00:05:49.973 --> 00:05:51.093]  I don't care who you are.
[00:05:51.453 --> 00:05:57.434]  You come at children with experimental Nuremberg Code violating vaccines that you broke the law to ram through.
[00:05:57.734 --> 00:06:02.915]  You are terrorists in league with Joseph Mengele 2.0.
[00:06:03.495 --> 00:06:05.796]  We have a player down on the court.
[00:06:05.836 --> 00:06:07.496]  We'll try to get more information.
[00:06:07.716 --> 00:06:12.077]  Johnson taken out on a stretcher and rushed to local Tallahassee Memorial Hospital.
[00:06:15.547 --> 00:06:20.794]  Leading cardiologist says cluster of collapses in footballers likely to be just a coincidence.
[00:06:20.975 --> 00:06:23.638]  A terrible coincidence at that, but just a coincidence.
[00:06:23.658 --> 00:06:24.860]  Yes, just a coincidence.
[00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:32.551]  You've got to shun people into getting vaccinated.
[00:06:32.711 --> 00:06:34.472]  You really need to get vaccinated.
[00:06:34.512 --> 00:06:36.053]  Get vaccinated.
[00:06:36.073 --> 00:06:37.714]  Listen to our government agencies.
[00:06:37.734 --> 00:06:39.195]  These guys are telling the truth.
[00:06:39.235 --> 00:06:41.257]  You know, there's no conspiracy here, folks.
[00:06:41.337 --> 00:06:44.119]  Just get your damn vaccine.
[00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:47.100]  I recommend taking the vaccines!
[00:06:46.941 --> 00:06:48.941]  Take the vaccines.
[00:06:48.941 --> 00:06:51.941]  Take the vaccines.
[00:06:51.941 --> 00:06:54.941]  Take the vaccines.
[00:06:54.941 --> 00:06:57.941]  Take the vaccines.
[00:06:57.941 --> 00:07:03.941]  Take the vaccines.
[00:07:03.941 --> 00:07:04.441]  See ya.
[00:07:04.441 --> 00:07:07.181]  (dramatic music)
[00:07:07.181 --> 00:07:09.181]  (explosion)
[00:07:08.835 --> 00:07:09.676]  Get ready, folks.
[00:07:09.856 --> 00:07:11.697]  It's Thursday, December 23rd.
[00:07:11.737 --> 00:07:13.017]  Start your engines.
[00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:17.320]  It's Thursday, December 23rd.
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:18.441]  The year is 2021.
[00:07:18.481 --> 00:07:21.602]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:07:22.603 --> 00:07:39.706]   And Jack Posobiec's a very smart, patriotic American, and he sent out this viral tweet that said pretty clear, Biden is only crediting Trump For the vaccine to set him up to take the blame for what comes next.
[00:07:41.227 --> 00:07:54.012]  And it's in the SPARS 2023-2025 John Hopkins Rockefeller Foundation, Bill & Melinda Gates, Pentagon joint operation that it will come out that these are not vaccines and have killed people en masse.
[00:07:54.372 --> 00:07:57.994]  That's part of discrediting the government and collapsing the Western world.
[00:07:59.074 --> 00:08:00.115]  It's all been pre-planned.
[00:08:01.175 --> 00:08:03.076]  That's how we tell you exactly what's coming next.
[00:08:04.364 --> 00:08:12.631]  Like, the announcement that, oh, gotta have three shots to be fully vaccinated, and oop, gotta need a fourth, oop, they're already up to their fifth in Israel.
[00:08:13.672 --> 00:08:15.633]  Europe and the UK are already up to their fourth.
[00:08:17.154 --> 00:08:21.198]  And I knew 21 months ago they would be 9 to 12 shots a year.
[00:08:21.398 --> 00:08:22.299]  Why did I know that?
[00:08:22.379 --> 00:08:24.000]  Because Bill Gates said so!
[00:08:27.603 --> 00:08:29.344]  Bill Gates wants to depopulate you.
[00:08:29.464 --> 00:08:30.745]  Bill Gates thinks you're subhuman.
[00:08:31.146 --> 00:08:31.726]  And you know what?
[00:08:31.786 --> 00:08:33.588]  If you don't stand up against him, you are.
[00:08:35.229 --> 00:08:36.690]  It's a test, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:38.451 --> 00:08:39.012]  Pretty clear.
[00:08:39.332 --> 00:08:40.072]  Yeah, pretty clear.
[00:08:40.653 --> 00:08:49.079]  Like a crystal clear mountaintop morning that Biden is only crediting Trump for the vaccines to set him up to take the blame for what comes next.
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:57.504]  Okay, we reached the quickening years ago, but there's no way to do justice to all these stories.
[00:08:58.205 --> 00:08:59.626]  These articles are not props.
[00:09:00.948 --> 00:09:05.992]  As I've said many times, all of these, you could talk for an entire four hours on each one.
[00:09:07.894 --> 00:09:08.575]  Let me just do this.
[00:09:08.695 --> 00:09:14.140]  Let me try, let me try to just do this.
[00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:18.804]  Let me try to just read a few stacks right now, just the headlines here.
[00:09:19.024 --> 00:09:20.585]  Here, let's look at one of the COVID stacks.
[00:09:21.246 --> 00:09:24.408]  Supreme Court will hold special hearing on vaccines in January.
[00:09:24.549 --> 00:09:25.750]  Again, they're not vaccines.
[00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:28.052]  It's the genetic therapy injection revolution.
[00:09:29.111 --> 00:09:33.556]  New emails reveal evidence of government efforts to suppress free speech across the United States.
[00:09:33.616 --> 00:09:34.197]  It's all confirmed.
[00:09:34.237 --> 00:09:37.521]  To quote, crush us, destroy us, silence top scientists.
[00:09:39.182 --> 00:09:47.812]  Emergency powers deployed to impose vaccine passports across the United States in blue cities, saying that if you get caught out without your passport, you're going to go to jail.
[00:09:48.152 --> 00:09:49.294]  See, that's martial law.
[00:09:51.299 --> 00:09:52.739]  UN-directed global government.
[00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:55.920]  Boston, New York, LA, the list goes on and on.
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:59.981]  Your time's up, Chicago mayor threatens unvaccinated with draconian measures.
[00:10:00.582 --> 00:10:03.922]  Said you're not allowed to sit down at restaurants, you can only come to the counter.
[00:10:04.443 --> 00:10:06.443]  Repeating what was done to black people in this country.
[00:10:06.603 --> 00:10:09.504]  Literal discrimination against everybody who's uninjected.
[00:10:10.904 --> 00:10:13.725]  Jesus would get vaccinated, Archbishop of Canterbury suggests.
[00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:20.815]  Australia's chief pharmacist says public needs to accept boosters and mask mandates for many years to come.
[00:10:20.835 --> 00:10:21.635]  They're all saying that.
[00:10:22.536 --> 00:10:23.397]  Now here's the big one.
[00:10:23.677 --> 00:10:24.718]  Oh, we can talk again.
[00:10:24.738 --> 00:10:30.262]  The judge ordered them a month ago to every month release 500 pages.
[00:10:31.964 --> 00:10:34.186]  And they just released more.
[00:10:34.706 --> 00:10:41.452]  And it's thousands of more deaths and 160 plus thousand adverse reactions just at the start.
[00:10:42.452 --> 00:10:44.114]  Oh, but don't worry, you'll get all the documents soon.
[00:10:45.109 --> 00:10:51.671]  The court obliged him and said, the document dump must be done in 75 years.
[00:10:52.832 --> 00:10:55.353]  They had asked for 55 and they said, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:10:56.233 --> 00:10:58.094]  You get until close to the year 2100.
[00:11:01.855 --> 00:11:02.536]  Just a few shots.
[00:11:04.356 --> 00:11:05.837]  Oh, we're not living in tyranny or anything.
[00:11:07.898 --> 00:11:21.291]   By the way, you know, earlier this week from the Netherlands and other countries, people did FOIA requests, they have similar laws there, and got The emails from the Davos Group telling the Prime Ministers and leaders what to do in the Build Back Better agenda.
[00:11:21.511 --> 00:11:24.592]  As if we need the memos to know they're being commanded from a central group.
[00:11:24.612 --> 00:11:30.453]  They're following the exact same operations, same names, same groups to bankrupt industrial society in a transition.
[00:11:30.713 --> 00:11:31.974]  Oh, your fuel costs more.
[00:11:32.194 --> 00:11:35.654]  You're in a transition now, said the head of the Department of Energy a month ago.
[00:11:36.295 --> 00:11:38.835]  We're going to bankrupt all combustion engines.
[00:11:39.075 --> 00:11:43.256]  California just banned them in small vehicles.
[00:11:44.426 --> 00:11:46.547]  And things like lawnmowers and leaf blowers.
[00:11:46.587 --> 00:11:48.207]  So, I mean, it's here.
[00:11:48.467 --> 00:11:54.310]  But oh, they have Reuters and AP and PolitiFact and the BBC, a big stack.
[00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:56.410]  There's no Build Back Better.
[00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:57.591]  There's no Great Reset.
[00:11:57.671 --> 00:12:00.872]  It's all made up, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:12:02.032 --> 00:12:04.093]  Glashow isn't on TV commanding everything.
[00:12:04.413 --> 00:12:05.734]  People don't go and bow before him.
[00:12:05.754 --> 00:12:06.654]  He's not announcing.
[00:12:08.012 --> 00:12:11.236]  Forced injections and microchips to buy and sell, even though he is.
[00:12:11.256 --> 00:12:14.361]  Oh no, Reuters said it's all lies!
[00:12:16.002 --> 00:12:19.205]  It's all, and the head of Reuters is on the board of Pfizer.
[00:12:20.406 --> 00:12:25.390]  Continuing, sorry I got stuck on that one because this, this is a massive story right here.
[00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:39.602]  And then the documents that are in it, which I'm sorry I haven't had a chance to read them all, I've just read the synopsis, but thousands of more deaths, thousands of more miscarriages, bleeding out of your nose, having convulsions, becoming paralyzed, becoming blind, your ovaries basically dissolving.
[00:12:39.622 --> 00:12:41.664]  Uh oh, oh and I've got more on that.
[00:12:42.244 --> 00:12:43.986]  But it's all liberal, it's so trendy.
[00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:54.117]  Major Norwegian study finds COVID-19 vaccines interfere with young women's periods and basically give you endometriosis where your uterus has got to be removed.
[00:12:54.738 --> 00:12:57.820]  Well, that yuckes your body, then attacks the spike protein, which is what?
[00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:59.101]  A fast-growing protein.
[00:12:59.601 --> 00:13:01.523]  What does a woman grow in her uterus?
[00:13:01.683 --> 00:13:04.185]  A fast-growing protein.
[00:13:05.763 --> 00:13:11.667]  Almost identical to blood, which is the exact same thing Dr. Yidan a year and a half ago warned.
[00:13:11.928 --> 00:13:23.736]  He said this spike protein in the virus is almost identical to the lining that the women grow every month so that an egg can implant and then become an embryo.
[00:13:24.557 --> 00:13:26.978]  The fertilized egg, the zygote.
[00:13:28.019 --> 00:13:31.822]  And he said this will attack women's ovaries because it's full of the fast-growing protein.
[00:13:32.819 --> 00:13:34.180]  And it will attack their uterus.
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:35.942]  And BINGO!
[00:13:36.382 --> 00:13:37.263]  BINGO!
[00:13:37.703 --> 00:13:38.504]  BINGO!
[00:13:38.924 --> 00:13:40.145]  It's depopulation.
[00:13:40.245 --> 00:13:41.186]  It's sterilization.
[00:13:41.506 --> 00:13:42.507]  You get a heart attack.
[00:13:42.847 --> 00:13:43.968]  You get sterilized.
[00:13:44.288 --> 00:13:45.269]  You get cancer.
[00:13:45.569 --> 00:13:46.850]  You get an autoimmune disease.
[00:13:47.031 --> 00:13:48.212]  You get ADE.
[00:13:49.513 --> 00:13:49.913]  Woo!
[00:13:50.173 --> 00:13:51.854]  You get prion growth in your brain.
[00:13:53.256 --> 00:13:55.237]  Speaking of Dr. Yeadon, let's play that clip.
[00:13:55.517 --> 00:13:58.640]  Former chief scientist at Pfizer, head of the virology department.
[00:13:59.474 --> 00:14:07.778]  So, when your government scientists tell you that a variant that's 0.3% different from SARS could masquerade as a new virus and be a threat to your health, you should know, and I'm telling you, they are lying.
[00:14:07.617 --> 00:14:14.137]   listen to him. Here he is. So when your government scientists tell you that a
[00:14:14.137 --> 00:14:20.937]   variant that's 0.3% different from SARS could masquerade as a new virus and be a
[00:14:20.937 --> 00:14:26.976]   threat to your health, you should know, and I'm telling you, they are lying. If
[00:14:26.976 --> 00:14:32.577]   they're lying, and they are, why is the pharmaceutical industry making top-up
[00:14:32.577 --> 00:14:35.537]  vaccines?
[00:14:34.448 --> 00:14:35.308]  They are making them.
[00:14:35.849 --> 00:14:43.813]  You should be terrified at this point, as I am, because there's absolutely no possible justification for their manufacture.
[00:14:44.474 --> 00:14:55.721]  But they're being made and the world's medicines regulators have said, because they're quite similar to the original vaccines, the ones that are being given now, we won't be asking them to do any clinical safety studies.
[00:14:56.161 --> 00:15:02.674]   So let me just say again, The variants are not different enough to represent a threat to you, so you do not need top-up vaccines.
[00:15:02.935 --> 00:15:07.145]  Yet, they are being made, and the regulators have more or less waved them through.
[00:15:08.564 --> 00:15:09.605]  I'm very frightened of that.
[00:15:10.066 --> 00:15:13.049]  There's no possible benign interpretation of this.
[00:15:14.691 --> 00:15:17.995]  I believe that they're going to be used to damage your health and possibly kill you.
[00:15:18.596 --> 00:15:19.076]  Seriously.
[00:15:19.457 --> 00:15:25.945]  I can see no sensible interpretation other than a serious attempt at mass depopulation.
[00:15:26.305 --> 00:15:28.227]  This will provide the tools to do it.
[00:15:29.048 --> 00:15:46.236]  And plausible deniability, because they'll create another story about some sort of biological threat, and you'll line up and get your top-up vaccines, and a few months or a year or so later, you'll die of some peculiar, explicable syndrome, and they won't be able to associate it with the top-up vaccines.
[00:15:46.256 --> 00:15:53.840]   But that's my belief, that they're lying to you about variants, so they can make damaging Dr. Yidan is the Michael Jordan of virology.
[00:15:53.659 --> 00:15:57.899]   that you don't need at all and I think they'll be used for malign purposes and
[00:15:57.899 --> 00:16:01.538]   if you don't wake up that's what's going to happen I think during next year.
[00:16:01.538 --> 00:16:06.499]   Dr. Yidan is the Michael Jordan of virology. He's in the top ten
[00:16:06.499 --> 00:16:15.218]   virologists worldwide on record and he's in the top two for respiratory viruses.
[00:16:13.583 --> 00:16:16.665]  So don't listen to Michael Jordan if he tells you how to play basketball.
[00:16:17.165 --> 00:16:23.029]  And don't listen to Dr. E. Dom when he tells you they're murdering you, murdering you, murder.
[00:16:23.469 --> 00:16:25.010]  Maybe folks won't listen to me if I call it murder.
[00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:29.573]  Maybe I go, red rum, red rum, red rum, red rum, murder backwards.
[00:16:30.533 --> 00:16:31.534]  This isn't a game, folks.
[00:16:31.794 --> 00:16:33.335]  I know it's scary, but you gotta admit it.
[00:16:33.715 --> 00:16:35.416]  Bill Gates is depopulating us.
[00:16:35.456 --> 00:16:36.637]  He is murdering us.
[00:16:38.391 --> 00:16:39.131]  And it gets worse.
[00:16:39.171 --> 00:16:40.972]  We now know they're implanting prions in us.
[00:16:40.992 --> 00:16:44.293]  They can hit with certain 5G wavelengths to activate them and grow them.
[00:16:44.573 --> 00:16:45.653]  They're a binary weapon.
[00:16:45.773 --> 00:16:46.373]  We'll be right back.
[00:16:47.774 --> 00:17:02.198]  There are literally hundreds of studies, I've read more than 10 of them in the last year or so, on the spike protein created by the Pfizer, Moderna, J&J, AstraZeneca injections, and now the new Pentagon system that admittedly, quote, uses nanotech.
[00:17:04.671 --> 00:17:14.114]  That it goes in and breaks the double helix of the DNA at the cellular level, which does one of two things, kills the cell or causes cancer.
[00:17:15.855 --> 00:17:21.776]  And I just played you Dr. Michael Yeadon, the former chief scientist at Pfizer, over their vaccine program.
[00:17:22.677 --> 00:17:23.477]  But he was chief scientist.
[00:17:26.081 --> 00:17:31.728]  Not the politician, not the banker, the guy actually running stuff, saying he sees no other way than they're trying to kill you.
[00:17:31.908 --> 00:17:46.745]  And if you go read what he and Wolfgang Ludarg on December 1st of last year, now over a year ago, put an emergency injunction lawsuit in with hundreds of pages of addendums and studies and links.
[00:17:48.391 --> 00:17:55.565]  Saying it's going to cause attacks on the ovaries, attacks on the uterus, attacks on the heart, attacks on the arteries, attacks on the brain, attacks on the lungs.
[00:17:56.126 --> 00:17:57.328]  It's going to cause miscarriages.
[00:17:57.408 --> 00:17:58.691]  It's going to do all of this.
[00:17:59.232 --> 00:18:00.815]  And it did every damn thing they said.
[00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:03.531]  This is real, folks.
[00:18:04.051 --> 00:18:17.177]  And imagine working at Facebook or YouTube or their parent company Google and Alphabet and Apple and all these groups and you're working there helping suppress this when it's a fact you've signed on to depopulation.
[00:18:17.557 --> 00:18:20.659]  It's a fact you're being made to take these shots yourselves.
[00:18:20.979 --> 00:18:22.880]  What are you going to do when you get the autoimmune disease?
[00:18:23.464 --> 00:18:28.806]  Well, as Dr. Gidon said, they'll claim it's some new virus, or some new syndrome, which they're already doing.
[00:18:28.826 --> 00:18:32.647]  They're going, oh, everybody's in the hospital dying because of Omicron.
[00:18:32.868 --> 00:18:35.168]  We're having twice as many deaths this year than last.
[00:18:35.509 --> 00:18:36.989]  The hospitals are really full this time.
[00:18:37.029 --> 00:18:38.610]  They weren't last year because of Omicron.
[00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:40.650]  And then people go, wait, Omicron's like a cold.
[00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:41.531]  You don't even die from it.
[00:18:41.851 --> 00:18:43.071]  Almost basically no one.
[00:18:43.091 --> 00:18:49.754]  In fact, all the deaths are, again, car wrecks, you know, just, oh, he died of Omicron.
[00:18:52.913 --> 00:18:54.354]  Omicron, however the hell you want to say it.
[00:18:54.935 --> 00:18:57.376]  But that's where we are.
[00:19:00.078 --> 00:19:05.142]  And there he is, saying there's no doubt this is depopulation.
[00:19:05.202 --> 00:19:11.987]  He says these top-off vaccines, or as they call them in the UK, boosters, will make it worse.
[00:19:12.047 --> 00:19:12.528]  And you know what?
[00:19:12.568 --> 00:19:13.689]  People are hedging their bets now.
[00:19:14.469 --> 00:19:14.989]  Thank God.
[00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:20.994]  I have mainstream news all over the world.
[00:19:21.034 --> 00:19:22.155]  Let me just show you a few of these.
[00:19:23.436 --> 00:19:27.737]  Mainstream news saying, hey, we better not give these to young people.
[00:19:28.117 --> 00:19:35.759]  A, they don't get sick from this stuff, and B, it's causing heart attacks in massive numbers and other horrible, quote, adverse reactions.
[00:19:36.179 --> 00:19:37.560]  Here's the Wall Street Journal.
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:41.201]  The dangerous push to give boosters to teens.
[00:19:43.041 --> 00:19:44.201]  That's two days ago.
[00:19:45.461 --> 00:19:54.041]   Why do you think they had to have a CDC panel resign and an FDA panel resign?
[00:19:54.041 --> 00:20:02.980]   'Cause the majority would not sign on a year ago to this emergency garbage, and then six months ago
[00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:05.041]  for five-year-olds and up, remember?
[00:20:05.041 --> 00:20:05.882]  Remember?
[00:20:05.882 --> 00:20:09.701]   And then they get board members that don't even know what they're doing
[00:20:09.701 --> 00:20:12.201]   that are so disconnected, like, "Yeah, we haven't tested this.
[00:20:12.201 --> 00:20:13.942]  "We gotta just give it to kids and see what it does."
[00:20:13.942 --> 00:20:17.382]  Remember that clip of an FDA board member?
[00:20:17.382 --> 00:20:19.382]  The new guy they put on?
[00:20:19.382 --> 00:20:22.261]  So see, they don't even know they're being shut up.
[00:20:22.378 --> 00:20:33.366]  The government's being set up, and I'm not defending the government, a bunch of horrible criminals at the top of it, but I've war-gamed every angle of this, and then I even find Global's documents admitting it after I've war-gamed, because you can just see what they're doing.
[00:20:33.706 --> 00:20:35.187]  This is going to bring down civilization.
[00:20:35.387 --> 00:20:36.608]  This is going to destroy trust.
[00:20:37.909 --> 00:20:53.412]   Tedros, the Marxist-Leninist Chinese Communist agent on record who suppressed cholera in his own country and helped kill a million people and stole the money a decade ago, That would have helped him in North Africa.
[00:20:55.353 --> 00:20:59.174]  Well, this guy, we'll play that clip in a moment.
[00:21:00.174 --> 00:21:01.034]  This is unedited, folks.
[00:21:01.054 --> 00:21:01.475]  This is real.
[00:21:01.495 --> 00:21:02.535]  This is right off the UN website.
[00:21:02.555 --> 00:21:03.115]  I went and checked it.
[00:21:04.135 --> 00:21:09.737]  Said, we need to be giving shots to adults, not to children, to kill them.
[00:21:12.276 --> 00:21:18.378]  See, he lives in the UN world where they're putting stuff in vaccines for decades to kill kids and putting stuff in tetanus shots to make women have miscarriages.
[00:21:18.398 --> 00:21:23.579]  I mean, to him, it's just like talking about, yeah, there's too many, you know, chickens, we need to butcher some of them.
[00:21:24.199 --> 00:21:29.060]  Or, yeah, we got too many cows on the back hundred acre, you know, they're overgrazing, go ahead and kill 20 of them.
[00:21:31.181 --> 00:21:38.063]  They just throw it out there, like the FDA board member who goes, well, we just don't know what it'll do, so we're going to guinea pig the kids.
[00:21:41.863 --> 00:21:44.985]  Here's the head of the WHO, just throwing your face, here it is.
[00:21:45.886 --> 00:22:00.237]  So if it's going to be used, it's better to focus on those groups who have risk of severe disease and death, rather than, as we see, some countries are using to give boosters to kill children, which is not right.
[00:22:01.518 --> 00:22:05.201]  Give boosters to kill children, which is not right.
[00:22:05.828 --> 00:22:08.930]  By the way, guys, I shot a video last night that's on InfoWars where we loop it.
[00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:10.171]  You grab that for the next segment.
[00:22:10.491 --> 00:22:13.453]  Because I also want to play the FDA board member saying similar crap.
[00:22:13.974 --> 00:22:18.116]  So, folks, they're all hedging their bets.
[00:22:18.877 --> 00:22:21.559]  Medical journals everywhere saying, hey, you better not do this.
[00:22:21.599 --> 00:22:22.359]  Hey, this is bad.
[00:22:22.659 --> 00:22:23.720]  Hey, read the fine print.
[00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:27.222]  Hey, remember the first six, seven months of the rollout of the injections?
[00:22:29.364 --> 00:22:32.426]  The DNA-breaking nanotech poison?
[00:22:32.986 --> 00:22:34.007]  It's artificial viruses.
[00:22:34.047 --> 00:22:35.488]  It's synthetic viruses.
[00:22:36.152 --> 00:22:37.173]  Remember what they said.
[00:22:37.773 --> 00:22:38.834]  Remember what they said.
[00:22:39.014 --> 00:22:39.414]  Carefully.
[00:22:42.216 --> 00:22:47.939]  And think about what they said when they rolled it out.
[00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:51.101]  And what is it that they said when they rolled it out?
[00:22:53.583 --> 00:22:54.203]  They said nothing.
[00:22:55.744 --> 00:22:57.405]  Blank white sheets of paper.
[00:22:58.205 --> 00:23:03.088]  And the pharmacist, you know, by law, you're supposed to have adverse reactions, the studies, the approval, the whole history of it.
[00:23:03.108 --> 00:23:05.750]  It's like that thin Bible paper opens up to about what?
[00:23:08.143 --> 00:23:09.564]  Two foot by four foot, usually.
[00:23:10.965 --> 00:23:14.928]  I've seen some that are two by one, but usually they're two by three.
[00:23:15.609 --> 00:23:16.930]  Two feet wide, three feet long.
[00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:20.472]  You've got to get a magnifying glass, even if you've got good eyes, to read it.
[00:23:20.932 --> 00:23:21.893]  And it's all right there.
[00:23:22.213 --> 00:23:27.938]  These were blank as the driven snow until about five months ago.
[00:23:28.638 --> 00:23:29.939]  And what did they start adding?
[00:23:30.199 --> 00:23:33.001]  Oh, heart attacks, myocarditis, blood clots.
[00:23:33.181 --> 00:23:34.462]  Oh, oh, we told you.
[00:23:35.783 --> 00:23:36.384]  We told you.
[00:23:37.481 --> 00:23:38.321]  Oh, all over the news!
[00:23:38.421 --> 00:23:39.281]  Safe and effective!
[00:23:39.321 --> 00:23:40.202]  Never one problem!
[00:23:40.242 --> 00:23:40.902]  Everything's great!
[00:23:41.222 --> 00:23:42.082]  Everything's wonderful!
[00:23:42.482 --> 00:23:52.245]  And then, you go to a Walgreens, or you go to a Walmart, or a CVS, where they give these things, and you ask the pharmacist, hey, give me, uh, the insert, by law, they're supposed to give it to you.
[00:23:53.425 --> 00:24:01.567]  Every little ampule container of it comes with one, and you can read it, and now it says, heart attack, death, all that stuff, pancreatitis, it's got a big list of them!
[00:24:01.747 --> 00:24:03.187]  It's like, here's the bad stuff it does!
[00:24:03.227 --> 00:24:03.828]  We told you!
[00:24:04.328 --> 00:24:05.448]  Read the fine print, dumbass!
[00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:07.901]  That's their attitude, folks.
[00:24:09.203 --> 00:24:11.104]  And they know adults might read the fine print.
[00:24:11.164 --> 00:24:13.747]  That's why they want to get rid of the age of parental consent.
[00:24:13.787 --> 00:24:17.870]  So seven-year-olds in Europe are now being given the injection without parental consent.
[00:24:18.071 --> 00:24:19.432]  And now they're announcing the same thing here.
[00:24:20.172 --> 00:24:22.414]  Because a seven-year-old doesn't read fine print, do they?
[00:24:22.675 --> 00:24:25.457]  Hell, adults don't read fine print.
[00:24:25.657 --> 00:24:27.359]  But you know who does read the fine print?
[00:24:27.979 --> 00:24:29.401]  Alexander Jones, baby!
[00:24:30.742 --> 00:24:31.763]  I do read the fine print.
[00:24:32.938 --> 00:24:36.159]  And the fine print says, we are killing your ass.
[00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:45.561]  By the way, they wonder all over the country, they keep finding all these big supplies of unused so-called vaccine.
[00:24:45.781 --> 00:24:47.922]  It's because the pharmacists see their patients getting sick.
[00:24:48.182 --> 00:24:59.405]  At first they were giving it, and then suddenly about a month in they stopped, and they found around half the people in the country didn't get the vaccine, because the pharmacists are taking matters into their own hands, and they're flushing it down the frickin' toilet, and they're giving you saline.
[00:25:00.313 --> 00:25:05.816]  And that's how we're going to beat these people, is all of us as the humans saying no to the New World Order and no to this satanic attack.
[00:25:07.076 --> 00:25:09.918]  That's why they want robots to administer it all, so they know it's actually being done.
[00:25:10.418 --> 00:25:13.619]  The pharmacists across the Western world are saving millions right now.
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:15.720]  And God bless them.
[00:25:16.081 --> 00:25:17.081]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[00:25:18.302 --> 00:25:27.046]  Here is the director of the United Nations, WHO, admitting that vaccines of this type of mRNA to the children are killing them, but that's the agenda.
[00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:33.273]  You're about to see two videos which are extremely thought-provoking.
[00:25:33.933 --> 00:25:36.995]  Each clip has been documented and proven to be accurate.
[00:25:37.495 --> 00:25:38.836]  They're not denying they said this.
[00:25:39.816 --> 00:25:46.380]  The first clip is the head of the World Health Organization saying that countries are using vaccines to kill children.
[00:25:47.415 --> 00:25:52.461]  Another is a member of the federal government regulatory board in the U.S.
[00:25:52.521 --> 00:26:00.692]  saying, we haven't tested the COVID-19 vaccines on children, so now we're just going to give it to them to see what happens.
[00:26:01.352 --> 00:26:04.196]  Here are both clips back to back for you to watch.
[00:26:05.257 --> 00:26:23.529]  So if it's going to be used, it's better to focus on those groups who have risk of severe disease and death, rather than, as we see, some countries are using to give boosters to kill children, to kill children, to kill children, to kill children, to kill children, which is not right.
[00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:29.173]  But we're never going to learn about how safe the vaccine is unless you start giving it.
[00:26:29.593 --> 00:26:31.094]  You know, that's just the way it goes.
[00:26:34.324 --> 00:26:48.215]  We're never gonna learn what they really do to we give them to the children and now that we know the FDA a year ago was suppressing that when they started the shots it was causing mass death and new documents came out today under court order confirming thousands of more deaths.
[00:26:48.235 --> 00:26:49.016]  I'm gonna get to those.
[00:26:50.297 --> 00:26:52.359]  We now understand this is premeditated murder.
[00:26:53.624 --> 00:27:05.566]  Just like they designed it with the spike protein, the one thing that'll go in and destroy the double helix of the DNA, because they know your body will repair itself when it's attacked, this attacks the repair mechanism.
[00:27:06.807 --> 00:27:09.307]  It's equivalent of the reactor shaft on the Death Star.
[00:27:10.167 --> 00:27:11.348]  The one spot to hit us.
[00:27:12.308 --> 00:27:22.950]  And then everything unravels, and you die from a hundred different things, as Dr. Michael Yeadon, former chief scientist, who just retired three years ago, told you in the earlier video.
[00:27:24.295 --> 00:27:29.559]  Something just hit me while I was talking last segment that I already knew and we already talked about, and I know you know this.
[00:27:30.239 --> 00:27:32.561]  But listen to me very carefully, please, on my knees.
[00:27:34.102 --> 00:27:35.182]  Metaphysically, I'm on my knees.
[00:27:35.703 --> 00:27:36.663]  I'm asking you to listen to me.
[00:27:37.684 --> 00:27:40.466]  If you understand this, you understand everything.
[00:27:41.306 --> 00:27:43.268]  It's a Rosetta Stone, or what I call a skeleton key.
[00:27:43.608 --> 00:27:44.308]  It opens every door.
[00:27:44.909 --> 00:27:54.331]   If you understand what I'm about to say, And you explain it to other people, there's no way to debate this.
[00:27:54.351 --> 00:28:02.035]  Because you can show them the science and the studies that it makes you sicker and erases your immune system and turns off your killer T's and all that.
[00:28:02.295 --> 00:28:09.679]  People are like, okay, but when you explain to them, hey, do you notice that you used to get your vaccines at your doctor?
[00:28:10.519 --> 00:28:12.220]  Like a tetanus shot or whatever most of the time.
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:14.761]  Did you notice you can't get them from your doctor?
[00:28:16.302 --> 00:28:18.043]  Did you notice you can't get them from your hospital?
[00:28:19.417 --> 00:28:21.938]  Because, see, the globalists own those big hospital chains.
[00:28:22.138 --> 00:28:23.578]  They don't want them caught up in this.
[00:28:24.598 --> 00:28:41.502]  It's done through big state-sponsored, city-sponsored events out at sports stadiums and at church parking lots so that you don't have somebody to blame in a month or a week or a year when you die of a stroke or you have a heart attack or you get cancer.
[00:28:41.742 --> 00:28:47.203]  You go back to that airport hangar and there's nobody there or there's people's airplanes there and the gates are locked.
[00:28:48.166 --> 00:28:50.967]  And a security guard comes up and says, I don't know what you're talking about, because they don't.
[00:28:51.828 --> 00:28:53.148]  Plausible deniability.
[00:28:53.388 --> 00:28:57.310]  They shoot you with a DNA double helix killing weapon.
[00:28:59.471 --> 00:29:00.931]  You crawl off and slowly die.
[00:29:00.951 --> 00:29:09.335]  Your family spends all the money they've got trying to save you going right back to the same hospital systems and right back to the same big pharma that's been given liability protection.
[00:29:09.835 --> 00:29:12.616]  But the big pharma at the top has been given liability protection.
[00:29:13.428 --> 00:29:20.733]  It doesn't want its other divisions in arms of its big hospital groups and other things getting in trouble, so it does these big clinics.
[00:29:20.813 --> 00:29:31.980]  But then, CVS, Walmart, Walgreens, part of InfraGard, and part of the secret Pfizer agreement umbrella that's now come out there under, they were given liability protection.
[00:29:33.421 --> 00:29:45.091]   And so it's in that one place where, imagine, now listen to me carefully, you're a pharmacist, you know the people that come to you a lot, you know, especially small town ones, but You notice people come in, they get the shot.
[00:29:45.551 --> 00:29:46.872]  Maybe you gave 50 shots that day.
[00:29:47.432 --> 00:30:07.196]  And you notice the next couple weeks, you get heart attack medication, you hear a patient died, you know, you hear one of your customers died, you know, suddenly they're really sick, their brother or mother or son or daughter comes to the thing and says, yeah, Sandy, or yeah, Bob, yeah, your mom died, or yeah, mom is in a coma, or mom had a blood clot.
[00:30:07.596 --> 00:30:16.420]   And you're sitting there looking at your patients, looking at your customers, looking at people you take care of, And you're noticing a bunch of them are sick and dead.
[00:30:16.841 --> 00:30:24.827]  That's why they didn't want doctors administering it, and that's why there's no doctors in the United States, no private medical clinics, giving it.
[00:30:26.128 --> 00:30:32.954]  This has all been pre-planned from the beginning by lawyers and actuarists that study and war game every facet of this.
[00:30:34.921 --> 00:30:35.981]  And by the way, this is all admitted.
[00:30:36.322 --> 00:30:37.682]  So let's put up the headlines for folks.
[00:30:37.922 --> 00:30:39.043]  Remember that came out two weeks ago?
[00:30:39.463 --> 00:30:41.584]  That why aren't refugees getting shots?
[00:30:41.724 --> 00:30:46.586]  Well, the UN and the refugee groups don't want the liability.
[00:30:48.347 --> 00:30:55.730]  COVID vaccine manufacturers worried refugees could sue them following adverse reactions.
[00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:59.271]  So that's where we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:31:00.663 --> 00:31:02.164]  It's done in select areas.
[00:31:02.724 --> 00:31:04.866]  It's done in neutral third-party sites.
[00:31:05.886 --> 00:31:08.968]  Because nobody wants a bunch of people killed in their backyard.
[00:31:10.049 --> 00:31:11.770]  Nobody wants to be connected to this.
[00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:26.760]  They want to have a bunch of layers of insulation of your local government, of your state government, of your federal government, of the UN international government, all the liability protection with Big Pharma at the top, carrying all this out.
[00:31:27.617 --> 00:31:41.042]  Because if you had doctors that run a family practice, like my dad, and they see their patients come in, like Dr. Zelenko, and they see, in Zelenko's case, he has 30,000 patients.
[00:31:41.802 --> 00:31:42.362]  Sounds like a lot.
[00:31:42.402 --> 00:31:44.723]  My dad had over 10,000 patients, just himself in dentistry.
[00:31:46.175 --> 00:31:50.237]  And you see them get the shot, because Alinko wasn't giving it to some of his patients.
[00:31:50.257 --> 00:31:51.338]  They were going and getting it other places.
[00:31:51.678 --> 00:31:53.218]  And you see the adverse reaction.
[00:31:53.258 --> 00:31:54.359]  You see the bad problem.
[00:31:54.659 --> 00:31:57.480]  You know, you're like, my God, I've never seen many of my patients this sick.
[00:31:57.981 --> 00:32:05.064]  One of the big doctors, there's a bunch of them in Europe and here, the head of the German epidemiology national pathology union.
[00:32:06.165 --> 00:32:06.945]  Pathology union.
[00:32:10.759 --> 00:32:15.361]  He said we've seen a 20-fold increase in cancers, a double-fold in heart attacks and myocarditis.
[00:32:15.682 --> 00:32:22.705]  Same numbers out of Scotland, same numbers out of Ireland, same numbers out of Canada, same numbers out of the US, same numbers out of Germany and Spain.
[00:32:22.765 --> 00:32:26.647]  A doubling of heart attacks and myocarditis at least.
[00:32:26.667 --> 00:32:27.788]  20-fold increase in cancer.
[00:32:27.988 --> 00:32:32.590]  And then what do these doctors that own these big biopsy companies come out and say?
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:37.121]  What did they say they saw, going back almost a year?
[00:32:37.601 --> 00:32:40.943]  The same thing the head German scientist said.
[00:32:42.583 --> 00:32:50.926]  We're seeing a 20-plus fold increase in rare cancers in the biopsies.
[00:32:50.986 --> 00:32:54.047]  These are doctors that own biopsy labs.
[00:32:54.067 --> 00:32:55.208]  There's a bunch of them out in public.
[00:32:55.368 --> 00:32:56.348]  We played the clubs many times.
[00:32:57.829 --> 00:33:03.534]   And they bring their findings In the UK, in Canada, in the US, in three cases we've covered.
[00:33:04.675 --> 00:33:05.915]  And they don't even want to talk to them.
[00:33:06.215 --> 00:33:13.537]  Normally, a major biopsy firm, a major laboratory calls the state government or the federal government, they're there in days.
[00:33:14.357 --> 00:33:15.018]  Sometimes hours.
[00:33:15.038 --> 00:33:15.898]  Like, well, what are you finding?
[00:33:15.938 --> 00:33:16.978]  Is there something going on?
[00:33:17.018 --> 00:33:17.818]  Oh, no, no, no, no.
[00:33:17.959 --> 00:33:24.617]   Yeah, if there's a chemical spill, And then they find, you know, the town's all getting sick, you know, they say, oh my God, some toxins got in the water, and they tell people.
[00:33:25.037 --> 00:33:33.519]  They're not telling you, and these scientists and doctors are going to them and saying, this is happening, we're worried, and they're being told, doesn't matter, shut up.
[00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:43.261]  What did that big undertaker, runs a big funeral home in England, say?
[00:33:44.561 --> 00:33:44.901]  What'd he say?
[00:33:44.941 --> 00:33:58.348]   He said, we're seeing a 20 plus times, he said, He said, I've seen way more people sick from heart attacks and blood clots than all my years as a coroner.
[00:33:59.728 --> 00:34:02.809]  And he said again, it's about a 20 time increase in one year.
[00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:04.050]  One year.
[00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:08.071]  Pathologists, coroners, scientists, lab owners.
[00:34:08.951 --> 00:34:13.113]  These are research scientists in Germany, in the US, in Canada, in the UK.
[00:34:14.406 --> 00:34:16.128]  The Japanese are like, we're not taking it.
[00:34:16.388 --> 00:34:17.769]  They're less than 20% injected.
[00:34:17.789 --> 00:34:19.531]  They're like, don't be mean, people don't want to take it.
[00:34:19.571 --> 00:34:20.251]  We're not taking it.
[00:34:22.914 --> 00:34:23.815]  We're not taking it.
[00:34:24.155 --> 00:34:24.956]  We're not stupid.
[00:34:24.976 --> 00:34:30.101]  6% of South Africa is taking it.
[00:34:30.141 --> 00:34:30.801]  They're not stupid.
[00:34:31.622 --> 00:34:33.984]  They've been experiencing UN love for a long time.
[00:34:34.925 --> 00:34:36.727]  We're just now getting some UN love.
[00:34:37.928 --> 00:34:38.448]  You like it?
[00:34:38.769 --> 00:34:39.089]  I don't.
[00:34:40.347 --> 00:34:41.628]  Dr. Zelenko is coming up.
[00:34:41.648 --> 00:34:44.610]  We have that amazing young lady in the viral anti-Trump video.
[00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:45.991]  She's joining us.
[00:34:46.852 --> 00:34:49.473]  And so that's all coming up here.
[00:34:49.613 --> 00:34:52.616]  Ladies and gentlemen, big broadcast today.
[00:34:54.057 --> 00:34:55.397]  When do you get the flack?
[00:34:57.219 --> 00:34:58.339]  When do they shoot at you?
[00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:01.602]  When you're over the target.
[00:35:03.063 --> 00:35:04.023]  Where do you want to be?
[00:35:04.964 --> 00:35:06.125]  Over the target.
[00:35:10.054 --> 00:35:11.134]  And that's a paradox.
[00:35:11.455 --> 00:35:13.235]  I don't want to be in the flack.
[00:35:13.255 --> 00:35:14.376]  I don't want to be getting shot at.
[00:35:15.156 --> 00:35:16.396]  But I've got to be over the target.
[00:35:17.477 --> 00:35:18.577]  I've got to get over the target.
[00:35:19.157 --> 00:35:20.618]  I've got to drop my bombs of truth.
[00:35:21.238 --> 00:35:22.258]  I've got to destroy the enemy.
[00:35:23.079 --> 00:35:27.220]  And when I say that, obviously I don't mean drop real bombs on these people.
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:29.301]  They've got civil war they're planning to start.
[00:35:29.341 --> 00:35:30.862]  They've got their whole Marshall law plan.
[00:35:31.302 --> 00:35:32.642]  No information's come out on that.
[00:35:32.682 --> 00:35:34.723]  We'll cover it some with Dr. Zelenko next hour.
[00:35:37.443 --> 00:35:39.044]  But I'm talking about what are they scared of?
[00:35:39.064 --> 00:35:41.985]  So let me cover a lot of different angles of this so people can get inside my brain.
[00:35:43.025 --> 00:35:44.926]  And hopefully you agree with me and take action on this.
[00:35:46.467 --> 00:35:50.128]  Here I am on air saying, please buy products, please buy things in a full store.
[00:35:50.168 --> 00:35:51.609]  We have an underage in the next year.
[00:35:51.629 --> 00:35:52.249]  We need more money.
[00:35:54.950 --> 00:36:12.955]   And then I get on air and I say, I'm going to pay out $5,000 prizes to everybody that can jump legally and lawfully nonviolently on national TV in a public place and get out The message that these are not vaccines, they are GMO shots linked to mass deaths in the FDA documents, Infowars.com.
[00:36:13.415 --> 00:36:14.416]  Something along those lines.
[00:36:15.557 --> 00:36:16.578]  And I want to pay it out.
[00:36:16.818 --> 00:36:17.158]  I want to do it.
[00:36:17.178 --> 00:36:18.399]  People say, well, you don't have enough money.
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:21.061]  I just sold my house to dump it all in here.
[00:36:21.762 --> 00:36:23.323]  The money's all for the war.
[00:36:26.169 --> 00:36:29.410]  That's the point, is yeah, we don't have a lot of extra money.
[00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:36.553]  We're spending it in the most important places we've got, like we did five years ago that helped bring down Hillary Clinton with Bill Clinton's rapist stuff.
[00:36:37.013 --> 00:36:38.274]  That's credit is bringing them down.
[00:36:38.514 --> 00:36:44.716]  They credited you, this operation, you taking the mission in stopping them, getting women to vote for Trump.
[00:36:47.037 --> 00:36:48.418]  And we know Trump was a lot better than Hillary.
[00:36:48.818 --> 00:36:51.199]  You know, I got major problems with him now, the direction he's gone.
[00:36:51.239 --> 00:36:51.899]  Back then, great.
[00:36:52.599 --> 00:36:54.120]  Now, got a lot of problems, but whatever.
[00:36:55.859 --> 00:37:11.986]  When I say it's time at ball games and on C-SPAN and on local TV shows and wherever, you see a live camera going in a street or somewhere, legal and lawful, jump in front of it or try to get interviewed.
[00:37:12.206 --> 00:37:14.867]  That's even better if you can get them to interview you and talk about that.
[00:37:15.087 --> 00:37:17.408]  That's not just so InfoWars gets visitors.
[00:37:17.888 --> 00:37:20.389]  InfoWars is a symbol of resistance they've tried to destroy.
[00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:22.791]  Or say Alex Jones is right.
[00:37:22.991 --> 00:37:23.731]  That's another symbol.
[00:37:27.541 --> 00:37:28.922]  Those are the only symbols we've got.
[00:37:28.962 --> 00:37:29.703]  What else can we say?
[00:37:29.743 --> 00:37:30.463]  Let's go Brandon?
[00:37:30.843 --> 00:37:31.904]  That just means F Joe Biden.
[00:37:32.204 --> 00:37:32.825]  He's a puppet.
[00:37:33.025 --> 00:37:34.086]  He's meant to get the attacks.
[00:37:34.446 --> 00:37:37.508]  Sure, it shows we're not buying his BS, but that's part of their plan.
[00:37:37.528 --> 00:37:41.671]  They don't want Klaus Schwab launch COVID-19, put him in prison, InfoWars.com.
[00:37:43.472 --> 00:37:46.714]  They don't want the real power structure being exposed.
[00:37:46.754 --> 00:37:48.536]  They want it to be their Muppets, their minions.
[00:37:48.736 --> 00:38:06.622]   And yeah, there's the first video, six months for the election in 2016, where Tucker Carlson and crew Including the ambassador's daughter, who's called for my arrest on air, are up there, and a guy jumps up and says, Bill Clinton's a rapist.
[00:38:06.702 --> 00:38:07.843]  Infowars.com.
[00:38:09.604 --> 00:38:17.971]  That one guy doing that caused the chain reaction, where it happened hundreds of times, and changed the course of history.
[00:38:18.011 --> 00:38:21.214]  Now, let's talk about somebody changing the course of history.
[00:38:21.294 --> 00:38:22.675]  Jesse Watters.
[00:38:25.555 --> 00:38:30.176]  Says, now you go out with a kill shot, deadly because an ambush, he doesn't see it coming.
[00:38:30.517 --> 00:38:45.361]  In the media, a kill shot's like when Doocy in the hearings or in the press conferences always just nails them with, okay, we pay illegals to come here illegally, but we don't pay people to come here legally.
[00:38:45.561 --> 00:38:46.262]  That's a kill shot.
[00:38:46.842 --> 00:38:47.582]  It's a mic drop.
[00:38:47.642 --> 00:38:52.003]  It means a Michael Jordan flying through the air, you know, slam dunk.
[00:38:52.804 --> 00:38:53.904]  That's what a kill shot is.
[00:38:54.733 --> 00:38:56.454]  Doesn't mean go kill Fauci, that's the last one.
[00:38:56.714 --> 00:38:57.515]  Now they're all over the news.
[00:38:57.675 --> 00:38:58.916]  Oh, firewaters!
[00:38:59.096 --> 00:38:59.656]  Oh, Fox!
[00:38:59.896 --> 00:39:01.917]  They called for our God to be killed!
[00:39:02.218 --> 00:39:09.302]  No, he called in his full quote for the media to confront him everywhere at press conferences and call out that he cooked up the stuff at the lab.
[00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:12.082]  And that he tried to block treatments that save people.
[00:39:12.462 --> 00:39:18.387]  And that he's invested and owns the spike protein HIV that's been put into the very virus that's a GMO virus.
[00:39:18.587 --> 00:39:20.309]  He's so easy to take down!
[00:39:20.649 --> 00:39:24.152]  And what Waters is saying is the answer, even better.
[00:39:24.493 --> 00:39:24.873]  Yes!
[00:39:28.456 --> 00:39:32.439]  I can't give bounties to other people's reporters, but the bounty is freedom.
[00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:34.021]  The bounty is you having a future.
[00:39:37.378 --> 00:39:38.919]  You know, I got an extra car.
[00:39:39.059 --> 00:39:40.000]  I'm selling it next week.
[00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:40.761]  I sold my house.
[00:39:40.861 --> 00:39:41.181]  I love it.
[00:39:41.201 --> 00:39:42.042]  It's the best feeling in my life.
[00:39:42.542 --> 00:39:46.966]  I'm getting ready to sell at an auction on air, basically almost everything I've got.
[00:39:47.927 --> 00:39:50.349]  Because next year is everything I'm all in.
[00:39:51.050 --> 00:39:52.812]  That's not me losing if the left celebrates.
[00:39:52.852 --> 00:39:54.214]  Oh look, Jones says he's running out of money.
[00:39:54.594 --> 00:39:55.795]  Damn right I'm running out of money!
[00:39:55.835 --> 00:39:58.398]  I'm like a giant booster about to get into orbit!
[00:39:59.299 --> 00:40:01.141]  I mean, we are winning!
[00:40:01.381 --> 00:40:02.322]  This is history!
[00:40:02.402 --> 00:40:03.684]  I'm ready to die for this!
[00:40:03.904 --> 00:40:08.369]  Of course I'm gonna expend everything I got, because now is the final round!
[00:40:12.205 --> 00:40:13.425]  So he's absolutely right.
[00:40:14.006 --> 00:40:15.626]  We need kill shots everywhere.
[00:40:15.766 --> 00:40:22.128]  Non-violently kill shots where we nail them with the truth and show everywhere they go, we're aware of what they're doing.
[00:40:22.468 --> 00:40:25.069]  And you're going to be walking down the street in a small town, big city, doesn't matter.
[00:40:25.329 --> 00:40:26.330]  You think of the ways you want to do it.
[00:40:26.350 --> 00:40:27.070]  You don't care about the $5,000.
[00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:28.450]  I know that.
[00:40:30.311 --> 00:40:31.011]  And I'm going to cap it.
[00:40:31.631 --> 00:40:32.672]  They're explaining the finances.
[00:40:32.692 --> 00:40:33.812]  We don't have that money.
[00:40:34.172 --> 00:40:36.453]  We're going to cap it at the first 30 that do it.
[00:40:37.413 --> 00:40:38.153]  And that's 5,000 times 30.
[00:40:38.193 --> 00:40:38.874]  So you do the math.
[00:40:40.704 --> 00:40:45.567]  Uh, and then sometimes it causes a chain reaction of us to get support, and if more money comes in, we'll up the contest.
[00:40:45.587 --> 00:40:46.347]  But who cares about that?
[00:40:46.667 --> 00:40:48.868]  Maybe you just want to do it and tell us you don't want the $5,000.
[00:40:49.268 --> 00:40:49.809]  I don't care.
[00:40:50.289 --> 00:40:53.728]  The point is it's a little reward to make it more exciting.
[00:40:53.728 --> 00:40:57.889]   It's not like buying a meal after you win a boxing match or something.
[00:40:57.889 --> 00:41:02.689]   The point is this is war, people, and we need to get out there on the streets and take action.
[00:41:02.689 --> 00:41:05.829]   And you notice they are running around like chickens with their heads cut off,
[00:41:05.829 --> 00:41:10.449]   crapping themselves right now at the idea that instead of the leftist saying
[00:41:10.449 --> 00:41:15.049]   it's mostly peaceful to burn down buildings, and Chris Cuomo and all the pedophiles that run CNN
[00:41:15.049 --> 00:41:18.269]   calling for violence and saying the guy that shot Scalise was a hero,
[00:41:18.269 --> 00:41:21.089]   as Wolf Blitzer's guest said, we're not calling for shooting people,
[00:41:21.089 --> 00:41:24.328]   we're not calling for breaking a ram's ribs, we're not calling for hurting the cops,
[00:41:24.328 --> 00:41:28.328]   we're not calling for burning anything down, we're calling for burning your lives down
[00:41:28.328 --> 00:41:31.489]  peacefully with the kill shot with the info war.
[00:41:31.489 --> 00:41:41.489]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:41:33.838 --> 00:41:35.239]  So this is what you need to see.
[00:41:35.379 --> 00:41:39.261]  You either want to be a slave and injected with liquid death, you want to be free, you do.
[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:42.701]  What Jesse Watters is talking about.
[00:41:42.881 --> 00:41:44.202]  This is the answer.
[00:41:46.004 --> 00:41:51.368]  And so, yeah, I want you to go out there and I want you to get it out on national TV, national radio.
[00:41:51.628 --> 00:41:52.989]  I want you to get it out.
[00:41:55.271 --> 00:42:03.297]  In fact, even if you don't follow the contest fully and don't get the full kill shot politically, $1,000 for people that just try.
[00:42:03.397 --> 00:42:04.678]  I'll give out 20 of those prizes.
[00:42:06.010 --> 00:42:15.174]  The point is, our listeners literally put The Globalist into a siege mentality where they launched COVID and locked everything down, the rest of it, just because they know they're rejected everywhere.
[00:42:15.514 --> 00:42:16.555]  Let's show it everywhere.
[00:42:16.735 --> 00:42:19.816]  It doesn't have to be a thing that Obama or Hillary or Fauci said.
[00:42:20.056 --> 00:42:20.897]  It's every event.
[00:42:21.097 --> 00:42:22.077]  It's gardening shows.
[00:42:22.317 --> 00:42:23.318]  It's car shows.
[00:42:23.698 --> 00:42:24.918]  It's bass shows.
[00:42:25.238 --> 00:42:26.879]  It's anything on national TV.
[00:42:27.279 --> 00:42:28.400]  It's baseball games.
[00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:29.400]  It's football games.
[00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:30.521]  It's basketball games.
[00:42:30.801 --> 00:42:31.661]  It's hockey games.
[00:42:32.001 --> 00:42:33.102]  You can do it in New Zealand.
[00:42:33.795 --> 00:42:34.916]  You can do it in Australia.
[00:42:35.256 --> 00:42:36.597]  You can do it in Mexico.
[00:42:36.837 --> 00:42:37.958]  You can do it in Brazil.
[00:42:38.259 --> 00:42:40.000]  You can do it wherever the hell you're going to do it.
[00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:44.463]  Just do it and say, we're aware of you murderers, and we know it's depopulation.
[00:42:44.784 --> 00:42:46.044]  Infowars.com.
[00:42:46.125 --> 00:42:46.905]  Alex Jones is right.
[00:42:48.707 --> 00:42:49.627]  Because let me tell you something.
[00:42:49.647 --> 00:42:50.028]  Let me tell you.
[00:42:50.328 --> 00:42:52.189]  That ain't about me being famous or getting credit.
[00:42:52.229 --> 00:42:54.731]  My John Hancock's going to be all over that sucker.
[00:42:55.732 --> 00:42:57.453]  Because I'm already in this thing 110%.
[00:42:57.553 --> 00:43:03.330]   Instead of giving in to fear, And backing down when I'm under major attack, I've decided to go all out.
[00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:07.331]  So when I ask you to go out there and do this, you know I'm pretty much signing my death warrant.
[00:43:08.091 --> 00:43:11.472]  Just have it be big and bold and in neon for me, okay?
[00:43:12.992 --> 00:43:14.492]  I want to be the symbol of the people.
[00:43:14.913 --> 00:43:16.673]  I want to be a symbol of somebody that doesn't back down.
[00:43:16.953 --> 00:43:20.194]  I want to be a symbol of somebody that stands up for the children, because God's watching.
[00:43:20.234 --> 00:43:22.474]  Not because I'm a hero, because it's my mission!
[00:43:22.874 --> 00:43:24.775]  And I've done all of this to get to this point.
[00:43:25.135 --> 00:43:29.376]  We've all done this together, and we're not backing down and giving in to these Satanists right now.
[00:43:31.491 --> 00:43:33.032]  You heard Dr. Zelenko when he was on last time.
[00:43:33.052 --> 00:43:36.734]  InfoWars helped build the platform and the launchpad for everything we've done.
[00:43:36.934 --> 00:43:42.916]  So instead of Trump 1 banners, like some of our crew have done, great people, it needs to be the vaccine kills.
[00:43:43.617 --> 00:43:45.878]  Vaccines poison, InfoWars.com.
[00:43:47.278 --> 00:43:49.039]  But let's play what Waters had to say, here it is.
[00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:52.301]  Now you're going for the kill shot.
[00:43:53.221 --> 00:43:57.483]  The kill shot, with an ambush, deadly.
[00:43:58.224 --> 00:43:59.344]  Because he doesn't see it coming.
[00:44:00.064 --> 00:44:10.143]   This is when you say, Dr. Fauci, you funded risky research at a sloppy Chinese lab.
[00:44:10.603 --> 00:44:15.006]  The same lab that sprung this pandemic on the world.
[00:44:15.686 --> 00:44:19.168]  You know why people don't trust you, don't you?
[00:44:19.188 --> 00:44:21.289]  Boom!
[00:44:21.529 --> 00:44:22.450]  He is dead!
[00:44:22.690 --> 00:44:23.670]  Yeah!
[00:44:26.172 --> 00:44:26.472]  Son!
[00:44:28.035 --> 00:44:30.297]  Now, you do that, 30 seconds.
[00:44:30.677 --> 00:44:32.238]  That's all you need.
[00:44:32.258 --> 00:44:32.719]  30 seconds.
[00:44:33.419 --> 00:44:42.346]  Now you get that footage to us, you get it to Fox, you get it to Human Events, you get it to Breitbart, you get it to Daily Caller, you get it through the Turning Point pipeline.
[00:44:42.446 --> 00:44:43.687]  Just don't mention InfoWars.
[00:44:43.807 --> 00:44:53.335]  Imagine Tucker Carlson teases out of the A Block, coming up, brave college student confronts Lord Fauci at dinner.
[00:44:54.815 --> 00:44:58.238]  I love how they take all my terms, Lord Fauci.
[00:44:59.859 --> 00:45:00.600]  Get us that!
[00:45:01.581 --> 00:45:02.421]  That's what we want.
[00:45:03.022 --> 00:45:05.844]  That changes the whole conversation of the country.
[00:45:06.425 --> 00:45:07.445]  Yep, great point.
[00:45:07.485 --> 00:45:08.146]  We'll be right back.
[00:45:08.166 --> 00:45:08.887]  Stay with us.
[00:45:09.707 --> 00:45:10.988]  Now you're going for the kill shot.
[00:45:11.909 --> 00:45:16.173]  The kill shot, with an ambush, deadly.
[00:45:16.973 --> 00:45:18.034]  Because he doesn't see it coming.
[00:45:18.755 --> 00:45:28.813]   This is when you say, Dr. Fauci, You funded risky research at a sloppy Chinese lab.
[00:45:29.293 --> 00:45:33.696]  The same lab that sprung this pandemic on the world.
[00:45:34.376 --> 00:45:37.859]  You know why people don't trust you, don't you?
[00:45:37.879 --> 00:45:40.020]  Boom!
[00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:41.120]  He is dead!
[00:45:42.201 --> 00:45:42.921]  He is dead!
[00:45:42.941 --> 00:45:45.203]  He's done!
[00:45:46.147 --> 00:45:47.268]  Do what must be done.
[00:45:47.288 --> 00:45:48.549]  Now how do you do that?
[00:45:48.569 --> 00:45:48.969]  30 seconds.
[00:45:49.329 --> 00:45:49.929]  That's all you need.
[00:45:50.930 --> 00:45:51.390]  30 seconds.
[00:45:52.111 --> 00:46:00.876]  Now you get that footage to us, you get it to Fox, you get it to Human Events, you get it to Breitbart, you get it to Daily Caller, you get it through the Turning Point Pipeline.
[00:46:00.896 --> 00:46:01.717]  Don't get it to M4s.
[00:46:01.737 --> 00:46:06.139]  Imagine Tucker Carlson teases out of the A Block, coming up.
[00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:12.023]  Brave college student confronts Lord Fauci at dinner.
[00:46:13.465 --> 00:46:14.646]  Lord Fauci, I love it.
[00:46:14.686 --> 00:46:16.707]  Exclusive footage, right back.
[00:46:16.928 --> 00:46:17.908]  Lord Biden.
[00:46:18.529 --> 00:46:19.269]  Get us that!
[00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:21.091]  That's what we want.
[00:46:21.691 --> 00:46:24.533]  That changes the whole conversation of the country.
[00:46:28.556 --> 00:46:29.456]  I've authorized it.
[00:46:30.897 --> 00:46:31.978]  Just make sure it's legal.
[00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:39.820]   You know, I really love Watching everybody imitate what we do, because that's actually my goal.
[00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:41.201]  People say, what do you like to call people?
[00:46:41.221 --> 00:46:41.821]  Lord Fauci?
[00:46:41.841 --> 00:46:42.462]  Now they're doing it.
[00:46:42.762 --> 00:46:43.923]  They're saying, go after the globalists.
[00:46:43.943 --> 00:46:44.764]  They're saying, get in their face.
[00:46:45.344 --> 00:46:46.225]  We're all the same team.
[00:46:46.245 --> 00:46:46.845]  These are tactics.
[00:46:46.865 --> 00:46:47.206]  These are great.
[00:46:47.226 --> 00:46:48.267]  In fact, send it to him.
[00:46:49.427 --> 00:46:52.290]  We've gotten plenty of credit for trying to kill me and put me in prison right now.
[00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:54.491]  All I want to do is win against these people.
[00:46:55.712 --> 00:46:58.715]  But here is the video before we even started the contest that had me happy.
[00:46:58.735 --> 00:47:00.036]  I did the contest five years ago.
[00:47:01.177 --> 00:47:03.759]  What I was saying, you ought to go confront them and say, Bill Clinton's a rapist.
[00:47:04.239 --> 00:47:04.920]  Infowars.com.
[00:47:06.629 --> 00:47:09.629]   This is the Tucker Carlson clip that caused the chain reaction.
[00:47:09.629 --> 00:47:11.829]  Waiting for this segment all morning long.
[00:47:11.829 --> 00:47:17.749]   We are rolling out the red carpet, not for Tucker, but for some adorable, adoptable dogs.
[00:47:17.749 --> 00:47:22.949]   Every year, the Best Friends Animal Society helps cats and dogs who are stuck in animal
[00:47:22.949 --> 00:47:23.949]  shelters find a house.
[00:47:23.949 --> 00:47:24.949]  Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[00:47:24.949 --> 00:47:25.949]  Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[00:47:25.949 --> 00:47:38.069]   So, that's what we need to do is peacefully, non-violently, but very aggressively and civil
[00:47:38.683 --> 00:47:41.825]  We'll talk with Dr. Zelenko, good friend of mine, great patriot for humanity.
[00:47:41.845 --> 00:47:46.388]  In just a few minutes we got a break, but we can joke and laugh about this all day.
[00:47:46.408 --> 00:47:51.412]  This is really, really, really, really serious.
[00:47:52.162 --> 00:47:59.785]  And we now have more FDA documents that have come out confirming what Dr. Yedon said a year and a half ago and what Dr. Zelenko said and so much more.
[00:47:59.865 --> 00:48:06.287]  And Dr. Yedon has also come out, former chief scientist at Pfizer, and said this is definitely a depopulation weapon.
[00:48:06.767 --> 00:48:09.168]  Six months ago he said it looks like it may be depopulation.
[00:48:09.188 --> 00:48:13.249]  He said now there is no doubt this is depopulation.
[00:48:14.189 --> 00:48:17.751]  That's like Michael Jordan saying there's no doubt he made the three-pointer.
[00:48:18.151 --> 00:48:19.951]  Michael Jordan knows basketball.
[00:48:20.071 --> 00:48:24.506]   Dr. Michael Yedon Knows vaccines.
[00:48:24.606 --> 00:48:25.567]  And this is not a vaccine.
[00:48:25.587 --> 00:48:28.909]  And you've got so many other scientists.
[00:48:29.669 --> 00:48:33.211]  You've got the inventor of mRNA technology coming out in emergency warnings.
[00:48:33.672 --> 00:48:39.555]  You notice the inventor of it was a little more tame about it the first year.
[00:48:39.575 --> 00:48:40.976]  Now he's like, no, it's depopulation.
[00:48:41.016 --> 00:48:41.697]  It's evil.
[00:48:41.917 --> 00:48:42.557]  We got to stop them.
[00:48:42.957 --> 00:48:46.860]  Just what Dr. Zelenko and I talked about the time before last he came on.
[00:48:48.681 --> 00:48:56.838]   And that was, we are going To have to just come out and say everything that's going down, everything that's happening.
[00:48:57.278 --> 00:48:58.759]  We got to just admit they're killing us.
[00:48:58.779 --> 00:49:00.761]  Because we argue, oh, this doesn't work.
[00:49:00.841 --> 00:49:01.941]  Oh, the vaccine's not perfect.
[00:49:01.961 --> 00:49:02.862]  You know, why are you wrong?
[00:49:03.322 --> 00:49:05.204]  If we do that, they keep winning.
[00:49:06.084 --> 00:49:07.445]  But that's not what's going on here.
[00:49:08.406 --> 00:49:09.246]  That's not what's happening.
[00:49:09.887 --> 00:49:14.490]  This is premeditated plan from the beginning.
[00:49:15.442 --> 00:49:18.864]  All right, we're getting Dr. Zelenko hooked up right now, getting his camera working here.
[00:49:19.324 --> 00:49:22.125]  We're going to go to break and come back in 60 seconds with him straight ahead.
[00:49:22.565 --> 00:49:26.247]  InfoWars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[00:49:26.627 --> 00:49:29.128]  And please don't forget FreeWorldNews.tv.
[00:49:29.609 --> 00:49:32.650]  It's the same address as Bandit Video, it's just on a blocked link.
[00:49:34.528 --> 00:49:48.804]  So if it's going to be used, it's better to focus on those groups who have risk of severe disease and death, rather than, as we see, some countries are using to give boosters to kill children, which is not right.
[00:49:50.194 --> 00:50:06.068]  So, when your government scientists tell you that a variant that's 0.3% different from SARS could masquerade as a new virus and be a threat to your health, you should know, and I'm telling you, they are lying.
[00:50:07.369 --> 00:50:14.011]   If they're lying, and they are, Why is the pharmaceutical industry making top-up vaccines?
[00:50:14.792 --> 00:50:15.653]  They are making them.
[00:50:16.193 --> 00:50:24.164]  You should be terrified at this point, as I am, because there's absolutely no possible justification for their manufacture.
[00:50:24.825 --> 00:50:36.056]   But they're being made, and the world's Medicine's regulators have said, because they're quite similar to the original vaccines, the ones that are being given now, we won't be asking them to do any clinical safety studies.
[00:50:36.496 --> 00:50:47.487]  So let me just say again, the variants are not different enough to represent a threat to you, so you do not need to top up vaccines, yet they are being made and the regulators have more or less waved them through.
[00:50:48.905 --> 00:50:49.946]  I'm very frightened of that.
[00:50:50.407 --> 00:50:53.390]  There's no possible benign interpretation of this.
[00:50:55.031 --> 00:50:58.355]  I believe that they're going to be used to damage your health and possibly kill you.
[00:50:58.955 --> 00:50:59.416]  Seriously.
[00:50:59.796 --> 00:51:06.283]  I can see no sensible interpretation other than a serious attempt at mass depopulation.
[00:51:06.643 --> 00:51:08.565]  This will provide the tools to do it.
[00:51:09.066 --> 00:51:15.386]   and plausible deniability because they'll create another story about some sort of biological threat
[00:51:15.386 --> 00:51:19.626]   and you'll line up and get your top-up vaccines and a few months or a year or so later
[00:51:19.626 --> 00:51:25.465]   you'll die of some you know peculiar explicable syndrome and they won't be able to associate it
[00:51:25.465 --> 00:51:30.425]   with the top-up vaccines but that's my belief that they're lying to you about variants so they can
[00:51:30.425 --> 00:51:35.546]  make damaging top-up vaccines that you don't need at all.
[00:51:35.791 --> 00:51:38.071]  And I think they'll be used for malign purposes.
[00:51:38.151 --> 00:51:41.912]  And if you don't wake up, that's what's going to happen, I think, during next year.
[00:51:44.253 --> 00:51:46.133]  Well, that's really scary, and it's true.
[00:51:46.153 --> 00:51:53.315]  It's Dr. Michael Yeadon, former head of the technology division and the head scientist of respiratory viruses at Pfizer.
[00:51:56.207 --> 00:51:59.308]  And Dr. Robert Malone's the inventor of mRNA technology.
[00:51:59.348 --> 00:52:01.209]  The first year and a half, he's like, maybe they're idiots.
[00:52:01.769 --> 00:52:03.730]  Maybe they don't know, but this is going to hurt a lot of people.
[00:52:03.770 --> 00:52:05.051]  Now he's like, no, it's premeditated.
[00:52:05.111 --> 00:52:05.491]  It's evil.
[00:52:05.731 --> 00:52:07.732]  We got to stop them because you cannot deny that.
[00:52:07.832 --> 00:52:13.574]  I had Dr. Zelenko on time before last, about a month ago, and I'm not tooting our horn.
[00:52:13.614 --> 00:52:15.175]  I'm saying we know what we're talking about.
[00:52:15.495 --> 00:52:18.076]  Please listen to us because I want to get out of this with our lives.
[00:52:18.116 --> 00:52:19.176]  I want you to get out of it as well.
[00:52:19.617 --> 00:52:20.297]  This is real.
[00:52:20.577 --> 00:52:23.738]  It's the biggest threat in the last human development.
[00:52:23.758 --> 00:52:24.839]  This is the biggest event ever.
[00:52:24.859 --> 00:52:29.081]   You cannot Debate that this is like Hitler on steroids.
[00:52:30.222 --> 00:52:43.889]  And that if we don't identify it's on purpose, and we don't identify these are war criminals, and we don't identify they cooked it up on purpose, then they keep being able to debate us and argue little fine points and keep people distracted.
[00:52:44.449 --> 00:52:48.371]  So that is not the point that we're making here.
[00:52:48.591 --> 00:52:50.232]  This is not some accidental thing.
[00:52:50.272 --> 00:52:54.754]  These aren't just companies that mean well that screwed up and all this garbage.
[00:52:55.353 --> 00:53:03.111]  These are individuals that are using this to take over the planet, and it's in the Great Reset documents, and it's an incredible time to be alive.
[00:53:05.043 --> 00:53:06.624]  Zev Zelenko joins us here.
[00:53:07.084 --> 00:53:08.165]  He needs no introduction.
[00:53:08.245 --> 00:53:09.105]  So much has happened.
[00:53:09.485 --> 00:53:18.150]  He also issued an alert yesterday that if something happens to him, that he's not died of cancer, which he's fighting right now, but that it could be foul play.
[00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:19.570]  I want to say the same thing.
[00:53:19.630 --> 00:53:20.931]  I'm getting a lot of death threats right now.
[00:53:21.231 --> 00:53:22.592]  We're not being dramatic, folks.
[00:53:22.972 --> 00:53:25.293]  We're at the tip of the spear exposing mass murderers.
[00:53:25.353 --> 00:53:26.354]  This is a war.
[00:53:26.834 --> 00:53:33.716]   And like Marshall McLuhan said 50 years ago, I got a lot of questions and a lot to say and a lot to break down and I want you to be able to take us where you want to go first.
[00:53:33.536 --> 00:53:34.496]  against each other.
[00:53:34.496 --> 00:53:36.894]  So Dr. Zalinko, so much going on, so much happening.
[00:53:36.894 --> 00:53:40.096]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Thursday broadcast.
[00:53:40.096 --> 00:53:44.016]  Hi Alex, thanks again for having me.
[00:53:44.016 --> 00:53:46.615]   I got a lot of questions and a lot to say and a lot to break down.
[00:53:46.615 --> 00:53:49.135]   And I want you to be able to take us where you wanna go first.
[00:53:49.135 --> 00:53:55.575]   So take us there and then I wanna talk to you about Dr. Michael Yidan, who I know you talk a lot about
[00:53:55.575 --> 00:53:59.976]   getting even more hardcore now and basically aligning with what you and I are saying.
[00:54:00.313 --> 00:54:07.740]  It isn't about us being right, but I think it's key to really have people face what we're up against if we have any chance of beating it.
[00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:09.521]  We're going to win.
[00:54:09.762 --> 00:54:11.623]  It's like someone who plays chess.
[00:54:12.104 --> 00:54:15.487]  The better chess player you are, the more moves ahead you could see.
[00:54:15.967 --> 00:54:17.889]  And I see already that it's checkmate.
[00:54:18.487 --> 00:54:26.171]  The only question that's still a variable is how much carnage and what will be the body count of the innocent until we get to that point.
[00:54:26.831 --> 00:54:37.636]  And the reason why I'm doing these interviews is that I hope that spreading the true narrative and giving people hope may mitigate or reduce the body count.
[00:54:38.296 --> 00:54:41.278]  And so regarding Dr. Michael Yadin, I know him personally.
[00:54:42.118 --> 00:54:43.179]  He's a mentor of mine.
[00:54:43.199 --> 00:54:46.160]  He's a brilliant scientist, former Vice President of Pfizer.
[00:54:47.097 --> 00:54:53.903]  And he told me personally that for every one child that dies from COVID, 100 die from the vaccine.
[00:54:54.604 --> 00:54:59.928]  The vaccine is 100 times more lethal to children than the virus.
[00:55:00.709 --> 00:55:09.957]  I think it's more than that, but he has the statistics and the data analysis to prove that, and he has actually presented that information to the world.
[00:55:10.998 --> 00:55:11.898]  He's a man of integrity.
[00:55:11.958 --> 00:55:15.607]   He has only Uh, what to lose from coming out of retirement.
[00:55:15.627 --> 00:55:16.527]  He's a very wealthy man.
[00:55:17.008 --> 00:55:19.610]  He doesn't need the, uh, all this aggravation.
[00:55:19.650 --> 00:55:30.318]  The only reason why he's doing it is I believe that he's being motivated by altruism and a genuine desire to, um, protect people from carnage.
[00:55:31.259 --> 00:55:42.948]  Um, now I think that it's extremely important to understand what is the motivation behind the criminals and monsters that have done this.
[00:55:43.826 --> 00:55:45.987]  Because, and everything, no one should believe a word I'm saying.
[00:55:46.007 --> 00:55:48.548]  They should just listen and then do their own due diligence.
[00:55:49.308 --> 00:56:08.896]  I provided for you resources and references to what I'm about to say, but much of which I'm sure you know, but 30 years ago, it became obvious to the people in power and people who are the wealthiest, most powerful people in the planet, that there was going to be a major catastrophe economically.
[00:56:09.702 --> 00:56:19.009]  Uh, in 30 years, there will be a collapse bankruptcy of the beginning bankruptcy of Social Security and Medicare.
[00:56:19.449 --> 00:56:20.470]  And that's all known.
[00:56:21.111 --> 00:56:28.056]  And Biden's recent policies of increased entitlements have upped the date to the anticipated collapse.
[00:56:28.116 --> 00:56:31.759]  The 2027-2026 used to be 2028.
[00:56:32.299 --> 00:56:33.320]  That's the beginning.
[00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:43.965]   And within 10 years, there'll be a complete bankruptcy that will have a tsunami effect on the global economy and threatened the
[00:56:43.965 --> 00:56:52.795]   stakeholders, their power and their wealth and control mechanisms over humanity, which they've had
[00:56:52.795 --> 00:56:55.485]  cultivated over millennia.
[00:56:55.485 --> 00:57:09.084]   We're talking about a force of evil that has always used human slavery as an asset.
[00:57:09.084 --> 00:57:13.885]   Slavery has always been the most lucrative industry in the history of humanity.
[00:57:14.119 --> 00:57:15.620]  And these people are amoral.
[00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:16.761]  They're not immoral.
[00:57:16.841 --> 00:57:18.062]  They are amoral.
[00:57:18.543 --> 00:57:21.665]  Which means they are moral when it's expedient for them.
[00:57:22.105 --> 00:57:24.267]  They're immoral when it's expedient for them.
[00:57:24.788 --> 00:57:27.190]  They support the Jews when it's expedient for them.
[00:57:27.570 --> 00:57:29.772]  They support the Christians when it's useful to them.
[00:57:30.192 --> 00:57:33.975]  And then they set the Jews against the Christians and vice versa when it's useful for them.
[00:57:34.035 --> 00:57:35.997]  They're capitalists when they need to be.
[00:57:36.037 --> 00:57:37.278]  They're communists when they need to be.
[00:57:38.062 --> 00:57:52.734]  This level of malevolence transcends all of these systems that they have set, and they play games and create chaos and geopolitical destabilization in order to promote their own agenda.
[00:57:53.055 --> 00:57:59.780]  In this particular case, it became obvious to everyone that there was going to be a huge economic collapse, and they were threatened.
[00:58:00.401 --> 00:58:01.121]  What have they done?
[00:58:02.002 --> 00:58:21.355]   They've initiated a plan over the last 30 years that Will result in when the system collapses, the dust settles, they will have the new financial infrastructure and control mechanisms to lead to the ultimate enslavement of humanity.
[00:58:21.515 --> 00:58:22.316]  And let me explain.
[00:58:24.897 --> 00:58:40.817]   In 2016, everyone knows Klaus Schwab said that within 10 years, meaning by 2026, right before the anticipated collapse, Seven billion people will be tagged with a digital tracking device, essentially.
[00:58:41.818 --> 00:58:50.945]  A biometric sensor that transmits biometric data with your location to a third party.
[00:58:51.485 --> 00:58:52.926]  And it's not science fiction.
[00:58:52.966 --> 00:58:55.468]  There's a patent, which we've spoken about several times.
[00:58:55.949 --> 00:58:58.751]  He said on French TV, he said, first you'll wear it, then it'll be on the skin.
[00:59:00.330 --> 00:59:00.870]  Right.
[00:59:01.031 --> 00:59:03.312]  That's Klaus Schwab saying that, and I have that video.
[00:59:03.752 --> 00:59:05.374]  But in addition to that, there's a patent.
[00:59:05.994 --> 00:59:07.775]  There's two patents that go hand in hand.
[00:59:08.096 --> 00:59:15.841]  The one patent that says that current vaccines have nanotechnology in them that allows them to measure your heart rate.
[00:59:16.842 --> 00:59:17.442]  Stay right there.
[00:59:17.502 --> 00:59:18.783]  We're going to come right back to you.
[00:59:18.803 --> 00:59:20.104]  This is riveting information.
[00:59:20.124 --> 00:59:21.665]  Dr. Zelenko, please stay with us.
[00:59:22.966 --> 00:59:34.085]   Now, I didn't talk to Dr. Zelenko before he came on air today, and I didn't tell him I want to talk about the Great Reset and Engineered Financial Collapse and how SWAB is now pre-programming.
[00:59:34.105 --> 00:59:37.026]  There's gonna be a big cyber attack that they claim terrorists launched.
[00:59:37.126 --> 00:59:38.107]  We know who will really launch it.
[00:59:38.487 --> 00:59:41.789]  And notice he just brought it up without us even asking because we're all synced up.
[00:59:41.849 --> 00:59:42.869]  That's God-consciousness.
[00:59:43.330 --> 00:59:44.530]  That's what scares these Satanists.
[00:59:44.970 --> 00:59:49.833]  He wrote an article titled, Government is the Enemy?
[00:59:51.014 --> 00:59:51.934]  What is really going on?
[00:59:52.454 --> 00:59:53.495]  By Dr. Zelenko.
[00:59:53.515 --> 00:59:55.516]  So, Doctor, please continue.
[00:59:55.616 --> 01:00:01.415]   You got caught up on the break getting into They know they fraudulently created all this fractional reserve banking.
[01:00:01.775 --> 01:00:03.095]  They've created all these derivatives.
[01:00:03.395 --> 01:00:04.816]  They've taken the world over by it.
[01:00:05.536 --> 01:00:06.376]  But it's a scam.
[01:00:06.396 --> 01:00:21.061]  So instead of them all going to jail, they've come up with a plan to collapse the world economy, pose as the saviors, and depopulate the useful seeders in the process, which is what so many corrupt feudal lords have done in the past, like the Aztecs and others, when they didn't want to feed their population.
[01:00:21.361 --> 01:00:21.961]  Please continue.
[01:00:23.662 --> 01:00:46.864]   Yeah, so the patent that I mentioned earlier It gives the technology and the mechanism through which Klaus Schwab's prophecy, let's say, about 7 billion people having a digital identifier that connects them to a centralized network or grid or matrix is going to happen.
[01:00:46.984 --> 01:00:51.445]  And the second patent that goes together with that is what Microsoft has from 2020.
[01:00:51.485 --> 01:00:51.725]  It's W.O.
[01:00:51.745 --> 01:00:51.805]  2020-06-06-06.
[01:00:56.465 --> 01:01:02.187]  And that patent describes the linkage of biometric data transmission to cryptocurrency.
[01:01:02.667 --> 01:01:04.507]  And so let me explain to you what that actually means.
[01:01:05.308 --> 01:01:15.651]  It means that in the future, say 2026 at the time, there'll be no more EasyPass, there'll be no more Apple Pay, there'll be no more credit cards.
[01:01:16.591 --> 01:01:19.872]  It'll be biometric transactions.
[01:01:19.972 --> 01:01:27.449]   In other words, you are now injected with a technology that transmits your internal temperament and
[01:01:27.449 --> 01:01:33.229]   your internal data with your location to a third party. Now, and that will allow you to,
[01:01:33.229 --> 01:01:38.059]   let's say, put your hand on a scanner and then walk out from the supermarket. So the hipsters think
[01:01:38.059 --> 01:01:42.909]   it's cool, but the problem with that is, what if I don't want to be part of the matrix?
[01:01:43.224 --> 01:01:48.028]  What if I don't want to be injected with a tracking technology?
[01:01:48.549 --> 01:01:50.891]  Well, then I would be excluded from the system of finance.
[01:01:51.372 --> 01:01:56.977]  I won't be able to buy bread, at least not probably on the black market, but I won't be able to buy bread for my family.
[01:01:57.498 --> 01:01:58.539]  So it's a control mechanism.
[01:01:58.599 --> 01:01:59.460]  It's the mark of the beast.
[01:01:59.820 --> 01:02:11.519]   In other words, if I don't participate in the system that they have created and control, I will be excluded from the ability to do transactions,
[01:02:11.519 --> 01:02:12.438]  financial transactions.
[01:02:12.438 --> 01:02:14.879]  So they don't have to put a bullet in my head.
[01:02:14.879 --> 01:02:20.238]   They just have to prevent my ability to buy food for my family.
[01:02:20.238 --> 01:02:24.999]   And that's like the social credit system in China, where basically they could set a radius
[01:02:24.999 --> 01:02:27.719]   through which I can't go out of my house and put me on house arrest.
[01:02:28.093 --> 01:02:28.994]  They know my location.
[01:02:29.034 --> 01:02:36.161]  I step out out of my permitted radius, let's say, and they turn off my ability to do violence.
[01:02:36.221 --> 01:02:38.023]  So this is a control mechanism.
[01:02:38.043 --> 01:02:45.852]  And the entire crisis here has nothing to do with medicine, has nothing to do with health.
[01:02:46.405 --> 01:02:54.290]  If there are fools on this planet right now who actually think that the governing bodies actually care about your well-being, then there's no hope for you.
[01:02:54.650 --> 01:02:58.872]  But the reality is that COVID-19 is a weapon of mass destruction.
[01:02:58.912 --> 01:02:59.953]  It was made in a laboratory.
[01:03:00.013 --> 01:03:00.673]  No one denies that.
[01:03:00.693 --> 01:03:02.154]  And I want to tell you something, Alex.
[01:03:02.174 --> 01:03:12.320]  I don't know if you realize that Ralph Baric, Dr. Baric, was involved in every step of the development of this bioweapon and converting it to a human virus.
[01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:20.094]   He took a bad coronavirus Changed some things on it, got a patent for it, and technology to convert it to a human virus.
[01:03:20.114 --> 01:03:30.781]  Then Dr. Baric and Zheng Li in Wuhan, funded by the NIH, they published a paper thanking the NIH, figured out how to augment the lethality of this virus to destroy human lung tissue.
[01:03:30.942 --> 01:03:35.825]  Which was key because Fauci wanted his HIV protein to be part of it so he'd get paid.
[01:03:37.106 --> 01:03:38.747]  Yes, but here's something you may not know.
[01:03:39.267 --> 01:03:48.349]   That in March of 2020, I came across data, papers, that helped me formulate my treatment approach based on
[01:03:48.349 --> 01:03:53.179]   zinc and zinc anaphores, which is what the Z-Stack concept is. What I didn't realize until last
[01:03:53.179 --> 01:03:59.908]   week was that Ralph Barrett published that paper. Wow. Processed that. In other words, the guy
[01:03:59.908 --> 01:04:08.089]   who made the bomb also created the antidote to defuse the bomb funded by the government. Incredible.
[01:04:08.014 --> 01:04:10.494]   Start over, say that again, that is, no, I did not know that, Dr. Zlingo,
[01:04:10.494 --> 01:04:11.653]  this is groundbreaking.
[01:04:11.653 --> 01:04:15.454]   Explain, oh my, you're a big researcher, and that's how you found these treatments
[01:04:15.454 --> 01:04:18.974]   somebody else had, and then when you found the research paper, it's the guy that was
[01:04:18.974 --> 01:04:23.653]   engineering it all out of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, with Obama, with Fauci, moving it,
[01:04:23.653 --> 01:04:25.414]  this is so huge, please start over.
[01:04:25.414 --> 01:04:29.774]  And by the way, on your Skype is a link to that paper.
[01:04:29.774 --> 01:04:35.733]   Everything I'm saying, I have evidence for, and it should be presented, because otherwise
[01:04:36.301 --> 01:04:36.441]  Yes, sir.
[01:04:36.461 --> 01:04:39.162]  We'll either put it on screen We'll put it in post later once this is archived.
[01:04:39.182 --> 01:04:39.842]  Please start over.
[01:04:39.882 --> 01:04:42.023]  This is huge All right, fine.
[01:04:42.043 --> 01:04:59.051]  So Ralph Baric in 1999 did research at the University of Chapel Hill, North Carolina He was able to manipulate a bad animal virus, a bad coronavirus Converted by modulating a surface protein to infect human beings, but it was still benign.
[01:04:59.071 --> 01:05:19.920]   It was just infecting human beings now And then, in 2010, the same Ralph Baric figured out a way to diffuse coronaviruses by using zinc and zinc anion, of course, inhibiting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase or inhibiting a coronavirus replication.
[01:05:20.060 --> 01:05:24.403]  In 2015, and by the way, everything's here is being funded by the United States government.
[01:05:25.144 --> 01:05:26.285]  So, because it's on the papers.
[01:05:26.795 --> 01:05:32.918]  And on the peer-reviewed papers, they thanked the United States government, NIH or whatever, for the funding.
[01:05:32.938 --> 01:05:50.067]  Then in 2015, in Wuhan, Eric, together in collaboration with Zhengli, Dr. Zhengli, the bad lady they call her, were able to figure out a way to augment the payload of this weapon to destroy human lung tissue and cause blood clots.
[01:05:50.687 --> 01:05:52.488]  They wrote a paper about it.
[01:05:52.568 --> 01:05:53.949]  They thanked the NIH.
[01:05:54.349 --> 01:05:56.510]  They published it and they got patents on it.
[01:05:57.349 --> 01:05:58.950]  And here's another layer to the story.
[01:05:59.010 --> 01:06:04.172]  The same Ralph Baric worked with a team from Gilead Pharmaceuticals to make remdesivir.
[01:06:07.474 --> 01:06:09.475]  Which destroys the kidneys and doesn't help you.
[01:06:09.515 --> 01:06:10.675]  This is so diabolical.
[01:06:10.915 --> 01:06:13.476]  So every way you can see the criminal pre-planning.
[01:06:15.017 --> 01:06:15.257]  Yes.
[01:06:15.877 --> 01:06:18.499]  And so this is a bioweapon.
[01:06:19.619 --> 01:06:21.220]  And they had the antidote for it.
[01:06:22.921 --> 01:06:26.838]   And they suppressed the antidote intentionally Not for themselves.
[01:06:26.878 --> 01:06:31.500]  You think these masterminds want their own families to die?
[01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:32.300]  Of course not.
[01:06:32.701 --> 01:06:50.747]  They themselves know, and this is consistent with what I knew about the executives of... Yeah, you broke that a year ago, and then Joe Rogan confirmed it, that hundreds of members of Congress in Hollywood all know about this, but still want it suppressed, that your protocol, they were using your protocol, but they suppress it for the general public.
[01:06:51.027 --> 01:06:51.808]  Talk about evil.
[01:06:53.428 --> 01:06:59.123]   Yeah, also the executives of Google, I know, internally that they're all taking hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin.
[01:06:59.963 --> 01:07:13.132]  And so this was this information, the antidote to the bomb, the poison, was known, was created by the same, the same monsters, but they hid it from you and me.
[01:07:13.372 --> 01:07:21.029]   Now when doctors like myself stumbled across these approaches, Because we had a necessity.
[01:07:21.089 --> 01:07:21.830]  The patients were dying.
[01:07:22.210 --> 01:07:23.270]  And so we needed some help.
[01:07:23.910 --> 01:07:24.590]  We needed to help.
[01:07:25.090 --> 01:07:26.050]  We needed to treat the patients.
[01:07:26.551 --> 01:07:38.533]  And so immediately, anything that would help, hydroxychloroquine, then ivermectin, and even the concept of early intervention, getting rid of this infection before the complications begin.
[01:07:38.993 --> 01:07:45.888]   Everything was vilified, marginalized, and Doctors that were advocating for it were deplatformed.
[01:07:45.948 --> 01:07:50.131]  What you laid out is they knew it, they had it planned, they censored it, they did it all.
[01:07:50.151 --> 01:07:52.692]  We'll come back with Dr. Zelenko to explain how huge this is.
[01:07:52.712 --> 01:07:53.633]  Straight ahead, please stay with us.
[01:07:55.434 --> 01:08:00.397]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Dr. Zelenko.
[01:08:01.357 --> 01:08:15.986]  And again, I would apologize for 14 minutes of ads an hour, but that's the standard for talk radio and TV, and I hate going to break with Dr. Zelenko saying something so important, but it's all hardwired in by the satellite feeds that literally cut into the radio stations.
[01:08:16.546 --> 01:08:22.069]  That's why the de-platforming off the main internet, we stayed on air because we had over 200 radio stations, and we still do.
[01:08:22.089 --> 01:08:23.910]  So we're very thankful to those stations.
[01:08:24.250 --> 01:08:39.423]   But I am going to start the new year three nights a week, At least three nights a week, a multi-hour commercial-free podcast direct to you, the viewers and listeners, with guests and callers, where I might take a break to go to the bathroom or get a cup of coffee or something, but it's not going to have regular commercial breaks.
[01:08:39.463 --> 01:08:42.166]  So look for that in the new year, something I promised to do.
[01:08:42.186 --> 01:08:43.768]  The world's so crazy, we're here.
[01:08:43.808 --> 01:08:48.212]  But Dr. Zelenko, I know our listeners are smart, they're awesome people, but I want them to get what you're saying.
[01:08:48.613 --> 01:08:50.795]  You're laying out any grand jury.
[01:08:51.776 --> 01:08:55.879]  It would take a few weeks to give a grand jury all this, but they would definitely indict Fauci for what you're saying.
[01:08:56.419 --> 01:09:01.182]  You're laying out the compendium of basically how this criminal plan was set up.
[01:09:01.642 --> 01:09:10.788]  And when you see how criminal it was, like you were saying last time you were on, months before the outbreak, Gates and Fauci are already sending messages saying, get the vaccine ready.
[01:09:10.808 --> 01:09:12.529]  You're like, wait, they didn't make the vaccine.
[01:09:12.569 --> 01:09:19.474]  No, they own the patents to what vaccine they, quote, wanted to then be sent out to the major makers, which they also got paid money from.
[01:09:19.514 --> 01:09:28.798]   So the trail I think is what you're saying of them scientifically preparing this is one of the most open and shut premeditated murder cases ever.
[01:09:28.818 --> 01:09:29.519]  Is that what you're saying?
[01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:33.142]  I'm saying this is the worst crime in human history.
[01:09:33.822 --> 01:09:35.183]  It's a genocide.
[01:09:35.764 --> 01:09:39.567]  It's mass murder, first degree premeditated genocide and mass murder.
[01:09:40.548 --> 01:09:50.076]  And it's being driven essentially by demonic personalities that are absolutely obsessed with power.
[01:09:50.908 --> 01:09:55.271]  And wealth, but more than wealth, I think it's power.
[01:09:55.331 --> 01:09:59.253]  Because once you have $100 billion, let's say, what's the difference if you have $150 billion?
[01:09:59.273 --> 01:09:59.833]  You don't feel it.
[01:10:00.214 --> 01:10:17.684]  But power and being able to enslave others, it fulfills the perverse desires of these narcissists, egotists, and really, I would call them Satan incarnate or the embodiment of the essence of evil.
[01:10:20.785 --> 01:10:22.946]  You know who Barbara Marks Hubbard was?
[01:10:23.106 --> 01:10:23.526]  Yes.
[01:10:24.887 --> 01:10:25.107]  Okay.
[01:10:25.147 --> 01:10:27.688]  She is the demonic mother of the New World Order.
[01:10:28.329 --> 01:10:30.690]  She, uh, I hope she burns in hell for all eternity.
[01:10:31.330 --> 01:10:35.892]  She, um, and I'm going to read you a few quotes from her that will explain to you the philosophy.
[01:10:36.272 --> 01:10:41.655]  She's the ideology, the mother of the ideology of Klaus Schwab, let's say.
[01:10:42.996 --> 01:10:46.857]  One fourth of humanity must be eliminated from the social body.
[01:10:47.418 --> 01:10:47.878]  It's a quote.
[01:10:48.502 --> 01:10:52.844]  We are in charge of God's selection process for planet Earth.
[01:10:53.484 --> 01:10:55.965]  He selects, we destroy.
[01:10:56.705 --> 01:11:00.407]  We are the riders of the pale horse death."
[01:11:01.527 --> 01:11:01.927]  End quote.
[01:11:02.267 --> 01:11:04.428]  Another quote from her.
[01:11:05.088 --> 01:11:08.610]  This act is as horrible as killing a cancer cell.
[01:11:09.270 --> 01:11:14.032]  It must be done for the sake of the future of the whole, so be it.
[01:11:14.657 --> 01:11:18.800]  Be prepared for the selection process, which is now beginning.
[01:11:19.020 --> 01:11:36.353]  We, the elders, have been patiently waiting until the very last moment before the quantum transformation to take action to cut out this corrupted and corrupting element in the body of humanity.
[01:11:36.993 --> 01:11:38.894]  It is like watching a cancer grow.
[01:11:39.475 --> 01:11:42.517]  Something must be done before the whole body is destroyed.
[01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:47.223]  The destructive one-fourth must be eliminated from the social body.
[01:11:49.064 --> 01:11:55.009]  I want to read you one more quote, not from her, from Jacques Attali.
[01:11:55.689 --> 01:12:04.196]  He was an advisor to the French Prime Minister from 1981 to in the 90s, I think 1991.
[01:12:04.296 --> 01:12:07.818]  Yeah, that was François Mitterrand, who was a big Luciferian.
[01:12:07.878 --> 01:12:08.459]  Please continue.
[01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:12.642]  Yes, so he was Mitterrand's right-hand man.
[01:12:13.855 --> 01:12:17.216]  And this is from a book called Verbatim in 1981.
[01:12:17.296 --> 01:12:27.298]  Now, the Facebook fact checker, Myth Busters or Myth, whatever it's called, says that this isn't true.
[01:12:27.618 --> 01:12:30.479]  But this is how I know that this must be true.
[01:12:31.239 --> 01:12:35.320]  The future will be about finding a way to reduce the population.
[01:12:35.940 --> 01:12:39.361]  Of course, we will not be able to execute people or build camps.
[01:12:40.071 --> 01:12:43.513]  We get rid of them by making them believe it is for their own good.
[01:12:44.213 --> 01:12:56.678]  We'll find or cause something, a pandemic targeting certain people, a real economic crisis or not, a virus affecting the old or the elderly.
[01:12:57.118 --> 01:12:57.679]  It doesn't matter.
[01:12:58.339 --> 01:13:01.340]  The weak and the fearful will succumb to it.
[01:13:02.041 --> 01:13:05.162]  The stupid will believe in it and ask to be treated.
[01:13:06.033 --> 01:13:13.837]  We will have taken care of having panned the treatment, a treatment that will be the solution.
[01:13:15.078 --> 01:13:19.580]  The selection of idiots will therefore be done by itself.
[01:13:20.621 --> 01:13:22.802]  They will go to the slaughterhouse alone.
[01:13:25.144 --> 01:13:25.544]  Wow.
[01:13:26.304 --> 01:13:32.948]  Dr. Zaliga, let me just say this, because this is about God consciousness, and I don't say something that isn't true, but it's a little embarrassing to say just because it's so personal.
[01:13:34.503 --> 01:13:36.585]  You normally, it takes about a week to get you on the show.
[01:13:36.605 --> 01:13:37.906]  Today you were able to come on.
[01:13:37.926 --> 01:13:41.549]  I had a dream about you last night, but I couldn't remember the dream when I woke up.
[01:13:42.210 --> 01:13:44.452]  When I got up, I said, I got to get Zelenko on today.
[01:13:45.252 --> 01:13:46.413]  And then I said, what was the dream about?
[01:13:46.433 --> 01:13:47.154]  I couldn't remember.
[01:13:47.975 --> 01:13:52.999]  And then I just remembered that I said to myself, well, Zelenko kind of says the same thing every time he's on, just like you do.
[01:13:53.019 --> 01:13:53.819]  It's not an attack.
[01:13:53.879 --> 01:13:54.280]  It's true.
[01:13:54.620 --> 01:13:55.561]  Same emergency message.
[01:13:55.601 --> 01:13:57.022]  But I said, no, today's going to be different.
[01:13:57.503 --> 01:13:58.944]  And then I intended to come in here.
[01:13:59.804 --> 01:14:08.728]  And talk about depopulation, talk about the UN, talk about Schwab, and talk about... She wasn't even by name, but those same groups, and then here you said it.
[01:14:09.408 --> 01:14:10.168]  This is amazing.
[01:14:10.769 --> 01:14:14.630]  And I'm not trying to be weird about it, it's just true, so I feel like I should have said that.
[01:14:14.710 --> 01:14:15.031]  Go ahead.
[01:14:17.452 --> 01:14:18.652]  Listen, truth is truth.
[01:14:18.712 --> 01:14:21.053]  It's in the air, you know?
[01:14:21.333 --> 01:14:29.250]   And people that are attuned to it, I think it's become much more accessible to anyone who wants to access and download this information.
[01:14:29.270 --> 01:14:30.691]  I'm not talking about metaphysically.
[01:14:31.171 --> 01:14:33.512]  There's an intuitive sense of what's true and what's not.
[01:14:33.613 --> 01:14:45.816]   Anyone who has some degree of sensitivity sees that this is a And God knows evil's coming after us and God's opened the floodgates.
[01:14:45.956 --> 01:14:50.197]  That's what I feel actually.
[01:14:50.717 --> 01:14:54.358]  I mean my discernment's way more powerful than it used to be.
[01:14:54.458 --> 01:14:55.578]  Are you seeing the same thing?
[01:14:55.418 --> 01:14:59.918]   Catholic these like all God knows evil is coming after us and God's open the
[01:14:59.918 --> 01:15:03.718]   floodgates that's what I feel actually I mean my discernment way more powerful
[01:15:03.718 --> 01:15:08.118]   than it used to be are you seeing the same thing but yeah but I see it
[01:15:08.118 --> 01:15:13.398]   actually in a different way that I see that God is giving every human being an
[01:15:14.162 --> 01:15:22.704]  It's like we're in the generation right before the flood of Noah and God is saying, listen, repent and get on the ark.
[01:15:23.205 --> 01:15:28.386]  Don't stay in the turbulent waters of idol worship and child sacrifice and paganism.
[01:15:29.007 --> 01:15:30.587]  You see, it's the decisions of man.
[01:15:30.607 --> 01:15:44.373]   If you know, there's a psychoanalyst, I'll remember in a minute, but Carl Jung, he wrote that the degradation of a society begins with the degradation, moral degradation of an individual.
[01:15:45.354 --> 01:15:51.019]  And so you can learn vice versa, that the moral improvement of a society begins with the refinement of the individual.
[01:15:51.539 --> 01:15:59.826]  And so it's the sum total of all of our bad decisions over the last whatever period of time that has led to the slaughter of the unborn.
[01:16:00.791 --> 01:16:20.419]  The defamation and desecration of gender roles, the desecration of what marriage is, the perversion and poisoning of the youth through the public school system, which teaches debauchery and normalizes the worst behavior, immoral behavior.
[01:16:20.439 --> 01:16:24.881]  So basically, this country has drifted away from Judeo-Christian morals.
[01:16:25.101 --> 01:16:27.202]  And let's just keep it simple, the Ten Commandments.
[01:16:27.802 --> 01:16:40.701]   And so therefore, it's not surprising to me That there comes a kind of a tipping point that's crossed the threshold that's been passed through collective humanity where God says, okay, now it's time for a cleaning.
[01:16:41.962 --> 01:16:43.262]  And I think that's what we're going through.
[01:16:43.402 --> 01:16:47.663]  And it may be the best result here is people repent.
[01:16:49.224 --> 01:16:53.645]  They return back to the, you know, the umbrella of the divine will.
[01:16:54.226 --> 01:16:55.386]  They live a moral life.
[01:16:55.746 --> 01:16:58.407]  They respect life, the sanctity of life.
[01:16:58.834 --> 01:17:06.821]  They respect marriage, they respect children and the unborn and so on, and that could avert a major body count.
[01:17:06.941 --> 01:17:13.726]  However, regardless of whether or not people are going to realize that, the cleansing will happen.
[01:17:14.547 --> 01:17:21.493]  And so, again, every single individual right now is being given a choice, and that choice is from God.
[01:17:22.455 --> 01:17:23.415]  And here's the question.
[01:17:23.435 --> 01:17:24.376]  Who are you going to bow down to?
[01:17:24.816 --> 01:17:25.156]  I agree.
[01:17:25.176 --> 01:17:26.176]  Stay right there, Dr. Zlingo.
[01:17:26.196 --> 01:17:26.876]  Final segment.
[01:17:27.096 --> 01:17:28.557]  We'll talk about solutions straight ahead.
[01:17:28.577 --> 01:17:29.197]  We'll be right back.
[01:17:30.657 --> 01:17:34.259]  You know, I've got another Barbara Max Hubbard quote for you.
[01:17:34.579 --> 01:17:36.059]  She's one of the gurus of Hillary Clinton.
[01:17:36.079 --> 01:17:38.560]  I think she's dead now, gone to hell.
[01:17:38.580 --> 01:17:41.081]  But she talks about, we are the pale horse death.
[01:17:41.121 --> 01:17:41.981]  We're the new world order.
[01:17:42.001 --> 01:17:43.021]  We're going to carry all this out.
[01:17:43.881 --> 01:17:45.542]  I'll pull that quote up for you coming up here.
[01:17:46.164 --> 01:17:47.925]  It's just a few minutes, but I was just paraphrasing it.
[01:17:47.985 --> 01:17:52.868]  But Dr. Zelenko, medical doctor who helped get the first treatments out to save millions of people, he's here with us.
[01:17:53.769 --> 01:18:00.994]  And I wanted to talk about where we're going here, because everything Satan does is a counterfeit.
[01:18:02.114 --> 01:18:04.496]  And so Satan says, oh, I'm going to call the people.
[01:18:04.596 --> 01:18:05.937]  I'm going to make them make the decision.
[01:18:06.057 --> 01:18:08.558]  I'm going to make them decide which side they're on.
[01:18:08.598 --> 01:18:11.280]  But then, really, that's God's plan.
[01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:15.263]  It's up to us individually to choose, not for Satan to make those choices for us.
[01:18:16.081 --> 01:18:17.682]  Here's Jack Posobiec, who's a smart guy.
[01:18:17.822 --> 01:18:25.347]  Pretty clear Biden is only crediting Trump for the vaccine to set him up to take the blame for what comes next.
[01:18:25.968 --> 01:18:28.990]  I think that's a very simple, neutral way to say it.
[01:18:29.010 --> 01:18:32.832]  And now Trump is rubbing it in after speeches in Texas saying, take the shot.
[01:18:32.872 --> 01:18:33.553]  It's totally safe.
[01:18:33.613 --> 01:18:34.213]  It totally works.
[01:18:34.233 --> 01:18:34.934]  None of that's true.
[01:18:35.474 --> 01:18:39.457]  Trump says most Americans dying are unvaccinated and encourages everyone to get the shot.
[01:18:39.957 --> 01:18:41.858]  Now he loved Dr. Zelenko's protocol.
[01:18:41.919 --> 01:18:42.479]  Help promote it.
[01:18:43.380 --> 01:18:45.801]  I think Trump just thinks doctors are trustworthy.
[01:18:46.381 --> 01:18:47.802]  He hasn't heard of Joseph Mengele?
[01:18:48.222 --> 01:18:51.243]  And I'm sorry to bring up a Nazi analogy, but it's the one that fits here, Dr. Zelenko.
[01:18:52.443 --> 01:18:56.725]  I think Trump's a good person, but I'm really worried about him with what he's doing here.
[01:18:56.745 --> 01:18:57.765]  I think he's being set up.
[01:18:57.805 --> 01:18:58.265]  What do you think?
[01:19:00.846 --> 01:19:05.448]  Whatever his motivations are, I have to publicly disagree with him.
[01:19:06.665 --> 01:19:07.665]  I think he's done a lot of good.
[01:19:07.685 --> 01:19:19.396]  I would say the main thing they did that was good was move the federal judiciary to the right with more than 300 justices that have Judeo-Christian values.
[01:19:19.896 --> 01:19:24.340]  I think that did help move the moral compass of this country.
[01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:28.884]  But what he's talking about when it comes to these vaccines, he really doesn't know what he's talking about.
[01:19:29.124 --> 01:19:31.927]  Or if he does, then I have a real problem with him.
[01:19:33.672 --> 01:19:34.794]  He's worried about his legacy.
[01:19:34.814 --> 01:19:35.796]  You know, he's a narcissist.
[01:19:35.996 --> 01:19:40.825]  And what he cares about now is his legacy.
[01:19:40.905 --> 01:19:42.508]  And he went warp speed.
[01:19:43.420 --> 01:19:54.762]  Um, due to political calculations, this I know for a fact, but, uh, he was going, looking into pre-hospital treatments and emphasizing that until hydroxychloroquine became politically radioactive.
[01:19:55.263 --> 01:20:06.325]  And then he made a calculation or his team got bad advice in my short that shifted him towards a warp speed, the vaccine development, because he thought that was going to help him win reelection.
[01:20:06.645 --> 01:20:10.766]  And then he went after he secured a second term, go back to pre-hospital.
[01:20:11.426 --> 01:20:11.826]  I was told.
[01:20:12.619 --> 01:20:14.700]  Pre-hospital treatment.
[01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:33.364]  Now, the reality is that the vaccines were known, the side effects were known, and the FDA knew about it, and months before they released this poisonous death shot on innocent humanity.
[01:20:33.884 --> 01:20:35.245]  That's right, I'm going to back you up.
[01:20:35.325 --> 01:20:39.846]  October FDA-CDC documents said they knew all these things would happen that did happen.
[01:20:39.866 --> 01:20:40.366]  Please continue.
[01:20:41.458 --> 01:20:42.638]  Slide number 16, yeah.
[01:20:42.678 --> 01:20:43.819]  That's exactly what I was referring to.
[01:20:44.259 --> 01:20:47.160]  And so, you know, he has a choice.
[01:20:48.100 --> 01:20:49.881]  I still hope that he chooses the right thing.
[01:20:50.361 --> 01:21:04.945]  I think that the Deep State operatives like Rick Bright and Janet Woodcock, and I have evidence for all that, sabotaged his plan when he gave an order to make hydroxychloroquine available to all Americans.
[01:21:06.693 --> 01:21:11.937]  Spun it and issued an emergency use authorization that blocked access to patients that are not in the hospital.
[01:21:12.317 --> 01:21:15.620]  Exactly the opposite of what his intent was.
[01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:18.702]  And that killed 700 million people.
[01:21:18.722 --> 01:21:19.102]  Exactly.
[01:21:19.122 --> 01:21:21.164]  So how does Trump extricate himself?
[01:21:21.244 --> 01:21:25.527]  I mean, how does Trump not be set up here?
[01:21:27.188 --> 01:21:29.730]  Well, he has to recognize that he was sabotaged.
[01:21:30.031 --> 01:21:30.911]  But forget about him.
[01:21:31.091 --> 01:21:32.833]  The American people were sabotaged.
[01:21:33.213 --> 01:21:46.979]   The interests of the American people, the lives and the sanctity of the lives Our lives are desecrated and so the only position that he has is to backtrack and say yes, I had my intuition initially was correct.
[01:21:47.714 --> 01:21:54.477]  The pre-hospital approach is the right approach and now we see the evidence of these vaccines.
[01:21:54.917 --> 01:21:58.039]  They don't work and they're dangerous and most people don't need them.
[01:21:58.378 --> 01:22:06.378]   So I'm pivoting now for the welfare of the American public and supporting proven data-driven solutions
[01:22:06.378 --> 01:22:11.378]  and not force people to go on a path of self-destruction.
[01:22:11.378 --> 01:22:13.297]  He has to do a mea culpa.
[01:22:13.297 --> 01:22:15.378]  He has to say, "I'm sorry, I made a mistake."
[01:22:15.378 --> 01:22:16.698]  And that's okay.
[01:22:16.698 --> 01:22:18.139]  I totally agree, Dr. Zelenko.
[01:22:18.139 --> 01:22:21.139]   And that's what I've been saying 'cause I know he got set up and sucked in,
[01:22:21.139 --> 01:22:25.818]   but the deeper he gets sucked into this, it's a major setup.
[01:22:25.818 --> 01:22:29.858]   In the time we have left, rest of this segment one more short segment with you what
[01:22:29.858 --> 01:22:32.697]   do you predict for I mean, clearly they're lining up.
[01:22:32.717 --> 01:22:35.420]  They're saying Trump supporters are going to launch terror attacks.
[01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:37.582]  The CIA is globalist control.
[01:22:37.622 --> 01:22:38.484]  They're wanting all this.
[01:22:39.024 --> 01:22:42.588]  They're trying to divide and conquer us along all lines.
[01:22:42.629 --> 01:22:47.574]  In fact, I was intending today, that was on my heart, to bring up how they're trying to divide Christian from Jew.
[01:22:47.994 --> 01:22:49.994]  and to get your take, but I didn't want to bring that up.
[01:22:49.994 --> 01:22:51.434]  And then you brought it up yourself.
[01:22:51.434 --> 01:22:53.095]  Clearly, we're all God's children.
[01:22:53.095 --> 01:22:55.314]  We all have God consciousness if we choose it.
[01:22:55.314 --> 01:22:57.594]  They're trying to play us off against each other.
[01:22:57.594 --> 01:23:02.753]   We have to transcend that in my mind or in my spirit, or we're going to fail because clearly
[01:23:02.753 --> 01:23:07.814]   they're going to use division going into the future and along race and religion to control us.
[01:23:07.814 --> 01:23:14.154]   Listen, I've been pretty savvy and I know, listen, I love you, Alex.
[01:23:14.154 --> 01:23:16.234]  You should know, I consider you a brother.
[01:23:16.050 --> 01:23:20.812]  A lot of the, some of the people that listen to you have an interesting view on Jews.
[01:23:21.332 --> 01:23:32.677]  But I'm going to say something about my own religion and about my own religious institutions and to the anti-Semites that are going to use these words, F you!
[01:23:32.697 --> 01:23:38.039]  Okay, why don't you look into your own organizations and religious structures and refine them.
[01:23:38.099 --> 01:23:54.032]   But I would say in my own religion, it's the Organizations that are the problem, they have been corrupted by the serpent and have preached anything but God-consciousness and are coercing people.
[01:23:54.052 --> 01:23:59.075]  I know synagogues, you can't go into a synagogue unless you show proof of vaccination.
[01:23:59.135 --> 01:24:03.857]  I mean, this is the perversion of a relationship with the divine.
[01:24:04.557 --> 01:24:10.454]   And so, and I see that in Other religions as well, but I don't want to talk about other religions.
[01:24:10.794 --> 01:24:11.675]  I want to talk about my own.
[01:24:12.536 --> 01:24:14.618]  And I'm calling out my own people.
[01:24:15.179 --> 01:24:22.206]  Start living by the law and stop getting on your knees and sucking up to the corrupt government.
[01:24:23.267 --> 01:24:29.354]  And selling out the congregants and the people that have put their trust in you to help them connect to God.
[01:24:30.858 --> 01:24:32.459]  Anyway, that's my commentary.
[01:24:32.499 --> 01:24:35.900]  I love you, too, because I know you have God consciousness.
[01:24:35.940 --> 01:24:37.641]  My spirit feels really great when I talk to you.
[01:24:37.701 --> 01:24:38.361]  I love you, too.
[01:24:39.041 --> 01:24:39.541]  Exactly.
[01:24:39.621 --> 01:24:42.582]  They have groups that have been divided and manipulated.
[01:24:43.063 --> 01:24:46.204]  And if you look at the anti-Jewish groups, they're being manipulated.
[01:24:46.224 --> 01:24:49.485]  If you look at the Jewish supremacist groups, they manipulated the black supremacist groups.
[01:24:49.585 --> 01:24:50.505]  All of it's stupid.
[01:24:50.845 --> 01:24:53.426]  There's an evil manipulating us against each other.
[01:24:53.746 --> 01:24:55.827]  And we have to transcend it or it's going to win.
[01:24:55.887 --> 01:24:56.888]  It's very simple.
[01:24:57.248 --> 01:24:58.008]  And God's watching.
[01:24:59.659 --> 01:25:08.165]  Because only when we're divided and have strife amongst us, that the enemy could then pick us off in segment.
[01:25:09.446 --> 01:25:20.453]  But if we are truly united by an overwhelming principle that transcends religion, which is actually a relationship with God, with the divine, we're made in his image, our lives have sanctity.
[01:25:20.513 --> 01:25:23.035]  That's enough for me to call you a brother or sister.
[01:25:23.055 --> 01:25:23.355]  That's it.
[01:25:23.916 --> 01:25:27.538]  And if we unite, and I want to tell you something, no one owns God.
[01:25:29.815 --> 01:25:33.098]  The Messiah reveals himself, and I don't care if it's the first, second, or third coming.
[01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:44.969]  Whenever the Messiah reveals himself and the truth of the divine is revealed, I can promise you, my perception of the divine will be wrong, and so will everyone else's.
[01:25:45.289 --> 01:25:46.910]  Because the essence of God is truly hidden.
[01:25:47.411 --> 01:25:53.379]   And hopefully we will See the truth and understand the truth of what he is.
[01:25:53.539 --> 01:25:58.683]  But right now we're living in the dark and we're trying to approximate, guesstimate what he really is.
[01:25:58.803 --> 01:25:59.984]  No, I totally agree.
[01:26:00.124 --> 01:26:03.707]  And the New World Order and Klaus Schwab are afraid of the coming of the Messiah.
[01:26:04.187 --> 01:26:05.989]  Everything they're doing is to stop the next level.
[01:26:07.805 --> 01:26:08.886]  Because it's the death of them.
[01:26:08.906 --> 01:26:10.386]  You know, darkness goes away.
[01:26:10.406 --> 01:26:11.867]  You just turn on a little light and it goes away.
[01:26:12.388 --> 01:26:13.428]  And so they know that.
[01:26:13.688 --> 01:26:15.889]  They've dug in because they're cornered animals.
[01:26:16.330 --> 01:26:17.370]  That's when they become dangerous.
[01:26:17.390 --> 01:26:19.091]  So you're asking about what else they can do next?
[01:26:20.512 --> 01:26:26.815]  Listen, I have some intelligence assets, as you do, and some of the options are pretty unpleasant.
[01:26:27.376 --> 01:26:36.264]   Whether it's another bioterrorism attack, like the smallpox on Marburg, virus or other weapons of mass destruction that can cause
[01:26:36.264 --> 01:26:38.505]  further destabilization.
[01:26:38.505 --> 01:26:43.944]   And these people have no problem wasting away billions of people.
[01:26:43.944 --> 01:26:48.264]  So, but the reality is I don't worry about that.
[01:26:48.264 --> 01:26:55.625]   And I have no promises or guarantees to myself or to anyone else that if you rise up and storm
[01:26:55.625 --> 01:26:59.384]   the beaches of Normandy of this generation, that you'll survive, especially in the first wave.
[01:26:59.527 --> 01:27:01.308]  There's a very good chance that you may fall.
[01:27:01.868 --> 01:27:02.968]  But, so what?
[01:27:03.929 --> 01:27:10.771]  You know, this is a finite life, but you have an opportunity now to connect with the infinite and the eternal, and you have to fall in battle.
[01:27:10.831 --> 01:27:12.731]  This is a hill worth dying on.
[01:27:12.992 --> 01:27:14.452]  And so it takes courage.
[01:27:15.172 --> 01:27:20.614]  We grew up with some degree of freedom, not because of us, but because our parents and grandparents fought for it.
[01:27:21.305 --> 01:27:23.007]  The question is, will our kids be free?
[01:27:23.328 --> 01:27:25.050]  Well, the answer is, are we ready to fight for it?
[01:27:25.111 --> 01:27:25.932]  Are we ready to sacrifice?
[01:27:25.972 --> 01:27:26.292]  No, that's right.
[01:27:26.312 --> 01:27:28.095]  We're living off gas they put in the tank.
[01:27:29.477 --> 01:27:31.620]  So, how about the next generation, our kids?
[01:27:32.441 --> 01:27:36.908]  I hope they grow up with the ability to thrive in a society of God consciousness.
[01:27:37.512 --> 01:27:38.152]  But it depends.
[01:27:38.272 --> 01:27:41.593]  Are we ready to create the environment for that to happen?
[01:27:42.013 --> 01:27:42.354]  Stay there.
[01:27:42.434 --> 01:27:43.514]  One more segment, Dr. Zelenko.
[01:27:43.534 --> 01:27:44.214]  You're absolutely right.
[01:27:44.914 --> 01:27:47.015]  The catalyst is here to go to the next level.
[01:27:47.355 --> 01:27:49.076]  We have to decide whether we're going to do it or not.
[01:27:49.096 --> 01:27:50.616]  Dr. Zelenko is our guest.
[01:27:50.636 --> 01:27:52.117]  We're going to come back in the final segment with him.
[01:27:52.477 --> 01:27:54.117]  Most powerful interview yet.
[01:27:54.217 --> 01:27:54.497]  Wow.
[01:27:54.937 --> 01:27:55.498]  And I'm not kidding.
[01:27:55.518 --> 01:27:56.098]  I woke up this morning.
[01:27:56.118 --> 01:27:56.798]  I had a dream about him.
[01:27:56.818 --> 01:27:57.698]  Couldn't remember what it was like.
[01:27:57.918 --> 01:27:58.719]  Get Zelenko on.
[01:27:58.739 --> 01:27:59.919]  Usually he can't come on short notice.
[01:28:00.179 --> 01:28:00.819]  He could today.
[01:28:00.859 --> 01:28:01.660]  So this is meant to happen.
[01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:02.500]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:02.900]  Stay with us.
[01:28:04.330 --> 01:28:07.393]  One fourth of humanity must be eliminated from the social body.
[01:28:07.493 --> 01:28:10.455]  We are in charge of God's selection process for Earth.
[01:28:10.475 --> 01:28:11.556]  He selects, we destroy.
[01:28:11.976 --> 01:28:13.717]  We are the riders of the pale horse death.
[01:28:14.278 --> 01:28:19.442]  I remember 25 years ago, I read that quote and I went to the library and checked it out and it was real.
[01:28:21.531 --> 01:28:22.952]  That's one of the top UN advisors.
[01:28:23.513 --> 01:28:25.294]  By the way, we should plug this.
[01:28:25.374 --> 01:28:26.255]  I haven't plugged any.
[01:28:26.816 --> 01:28:28.157]  Dr. Zalingo is doing such important work.
[01:28:28.177 --> 01:28:33.922]  He's got probably the best supplement out there with all the things fused into it for what you need for your body's immune system and more.
[01:28:34.262 --> 01:28:35.764]  You're insane, I think, if you don't get it.

[01:29:17.922 --> 01:29:19.443]  We've got four minutes left, Dr. Zelenko.
[01:29:19.463 --> 01:29:20.184]  Thank you so much.
[01:29:20.204 --> 01:29:26.427]  We hope you have a great holiday coming up and a wonderful new year, and we hope to be able to talk to you, obviously, next year.
[01:29:26.467 --> 01:29:30.309]  But in the last three and a half minutes we have, what else would you like to impart to the viewers and listeners?
[01:29:32.011 --> 01:29:53.884]  But first of all, I want to wish everyone happy holidays, Merry Christmas, Happy New Year, and my blessing to all people, to all decent people at least, that you should have long life and good health and material and spiritual prosperity and true inner peace and tranquility and appreciate just being.
[01:29:54.064 --> 01:29:55.084]  You know, that's one thing.
[01:29:55.565 --> 01:30:01.228]  Living with a serious illness, you learn to appreciate the moment and not take it for granted.
[01:30:01.986 --> 01:30:11.373]  And interesting, and we've spoken about this, Alex, that in the midst of all this chaos, I found the most serenity in my life than I've ever had.
[01:30:12.113 --> 01:30:17.937]  And I think it's a certain, there's a Talmudic saying that there's no joy like the resolution of doubt.
[01:30:18.557 --> 01:30:24.201]  And since I have no doubt what reality is, and I live within the reality, that's ugly, I know, I see it.
[01:30:24.642 --> 01:30:36.798]   But nevertheless, I see the truth, and I feel I know how my life It's in into that process, a sense of clarity and purpose.
[01:30:37.579 --> 01:30:44.562]  And when I'm aligned with that, I feel the most internal, let's say, emotional and intellectual and spiritual tranquility.
[01:30:44.682 --> 01:30:46.863]  And that's very interesting.
[01:30:47.423 --> 01:30:49.184]  And physically, I feel better now than I've ever felt.
[01:30:49.764 --> 01:30:52.766]  And so I don't know what God's plan is for me.
[01:30:52.806 --> 01:30:53.906]  It's like this divine wave.
[01:30:54.486 --> 01:31:01.720]   But clearly, it is to publicize the following idea that he's one, He's good.
[01:31:02.500 --> 01:31:04.321]  He makes us every instant in time.
[01:31:04.501 --> 01:31:05.081]  He loves us.
[01:31:05.881 --> 01:31:07.342]  And he gives us consciousness.
[01:31:08.082 --> 01:31:09.043]  And he gives us free choice.
[01:31:09.123 --> 01:31:10.903]  And really only he has free choice, right?
[01:31:11.463 --> 01:31:12.604]  No one makes him do anything.
[01:31:12.644 --> 01:31:14.104]  And yet he gives us that power.
[01:31:14.644 --> 01:31:18.125]  And that power is so amazing.
[01:31:18.786 --> 01:31:19.326]  But it's real.
[01:31:19.606 --> 01:31:21.206]  And we have to choose well.
[01:31:21.226 --> 01:31:22.707]  We have to turn away from bad into good.
[01:31:23.247 --> 01:31:24.908]  And so it's really up to us.
[01:31:25.808 --> 01:31:29.189]  There's a parable to describe the essence of evil.
[01:31:29.907 --> 01:31:32.829]  And it's a, you have a king and he has a son.
[01:31:33.429 --> 01:31:34.610]  The prince is going to be king one day.
[01:31:35.431 --> 01:31:38.013]  And he loves his people and he loves his son.
[01:31:38.033 --> 01:31:42.476]  So he wants to make sure that the son is worthy of being king one day.
[01:31:42.496 --> 01:31:48.680]  So he goes to a prostitute, the harlot hires her and sends her to seduce his son, the prince.
[01:31:49.060 --> 01:31:49.681]  That's the story.
[01:31:49.901 --> 01:31:50.641]  So let's analyze it.
[01:31:50.661 --> 01:31:52.042]  Does the king want the son to sin?
[01:31:52.062 --> 01:31:52.102]  No.
[01:31:52.883 --> 01:31:58.947]  I mean, he's actually just testing the son to make sure that he has the fiber, the moral fiber to be a good king.
[01:31:59.744 --> 01:32:02.445]  The prostitute, does she want the son to sin?
[01:32:03.045 --> 01:32:05.246]  Actually, think about it, she's doing the will of the king, isn't she?
[01:32:06.646 --> 01:32:11.087]  And so in this particular, that's how I conceptualize God making free choice.
[01:32:11.548 --> 01:32:12.408]  He gives options.
[01:32:12.548 --> 01:32:16.549]  If I give you a hundred dollar bill and a dollar bill and ask you to choose, that's not much of a choice, right?
[01:32:16.969 --> 01:32:20.670]  So you need comparable options for the choice to be real.
[01:32:21.070 --> 01:32:25.912]  So God makes good and evil and they seem equally attractive and waits for our choices.
[01:32:26.480 --> 01:32:33.268]  Now, if we choose evil, it's like me giving you a beautiful piece of crystal, you drop it on the floor and then cut your foot and you're bleeding.
[01:32:33.608 --> 01:32:34.889]  Was it my fault that you're bleeding?
[01:32:35.870 --> 01:32:37.312]  Or perhaps you should have been a little bit more careful.
[01:32:37.332 --> 01:32:38.213]  Beautifully said.
[01:32:38.453 --> 01:32:40.736]  Dr. Zelenko, hopefully we get to talk to you in the new year.
[01:32:41.136 --> 01:32:41.977]  Thank you so much.
[01:32:41.997 --> 01:32:46.162]  People can find more information right now at ZStackLive.com forward slash Alex.
[01:32:46.222 --> 01:32:48.244]  God bless you, sir, and we really appreciate you.
[01:32:49.614 --> 01:33:05.501]  So, when your government scientists tell you that a variant that's 0.3% different from SARS could masquerade as a new virus and be a threat to your health, you should know, and I'm telling you, they are lying.
[01:33:06.781 --> 01:33:13.431]   If they're lying, and they are, Why is the pharmaceutical industry making top-up vaccines?
[01:33:14.232 --> 01:33:15.073]  They are making them.
[01:33:15.613 --> 01:33:23.584]  You should be terrified at this point, as I am, because there's absolutely no possible justification for their manufacture.
[01:33:24.265 --> 01:33:35.493]   But they're being made, and the world's Medicine's regulators have said, because they're quite similar to the original vaccines, the ones that are being given now, we won't be asking them to do any clinical safety studies.
[01:33:35.934 --> 01:33:46.921]  So let me just say again, the variants are not different enough to represent a threat to you, so you do not need to top up vaccines, yet they are being made, and the regulators have more or less waved them through.
[01:33:48.345 --> 01:33:49.366]  I'm very frightened of that.
[01:33:49.847 --> 01:33:52.830]  There's no possible benign interpretation of this.
[01:33:54.452 --> 01:33:57.776]  I believe that they're going to be used to damage your health and possibly kill you.
[01:33:58.377 --> 01:33:58.837]  Seriously.
[01:33:59.218 --> 01:34:05.706]  I can see no sensible interpretation other than a serious attempt at mass depopulation.
[01:34:06.066 --> 01:34:07.988]  This will provide the tools to do it.
[01:34:08.809 --> 01:34:40.359]   And plausible deniability because they'll create another story about some sort of biological threat and you'll line up and get your top-up vaccines and a few months or a year or so later you'll die of some you know peculiar explicable syndrome and they won't be able to associate it with the top-up vaccines but that's my belief that they're lying to you about variants so they can make damaging Top-up vaccines that you don't need at all and I think they'll be used for malign purposes and if you don't wake up That's what's going to happen.
[01:34:40.379 --> 01:34:58.391]   I think during next year And he said that nine months ago Allison Steinberg who put out a viral video tens of millions of views everywhere saying listen, I've been a supporter of Trump She's been a guest on with Owen Schroeder before But now this is her.
[01:34:58.471 --> 01:34:59.532]  This is her Rubicon.
[01:34:59.572 --> 01:35:00.573]  This is her line of the sand.
[01:35:00.914 --> 01:35:02.835]  Here she was just a few days ago.
[01:35:02.856 --> 01:35:04.117]  I'm going to talk to her live today.
[01:35:05.922 --> 01:35:10.605]  I know this is probably going to be an unpopular opinion, and it truly does pain me to say it, but fuck Donald Trump.
[01:35:10.905 --> 01:35:16.649]  He is now trying to say that by us doubting the jab, that we're playing right into their hands.
[01:35:17.209 --> 01:35:17.489]  What?
[01:35:18.010 --> 01:35:20.711]  All we care about is exposing and knowing the truth.
[01:35:21.272 --> 01:35:29.917]  And he's going to sit here and continuously lie to us to push this bullshit narrative and the product that he wants to take full credit for.
[01:35:30.538 --> 01:35:31.879]  Do you guys not see the problem with this?
[01:35:32.819 --> 01:35:41.178]  I mean, if he truly cared about saving whatever's left of this country, and if he truly cared about you, then he should be more concerned about exposing...
[01:35:42.299 --> 01:35:46.142]  The overwhelming number of adverse reactions and deaths from the jab.
[01:35:46.162 --> 01:35:51.546]  But no, he continues to rally people up and deceive people into thinking that this is somehow good!
[01:35:51.566 --> 01:35:59.852]  Not to mention he's now claiming that he got the booster, which I don't know if that's true or not, but regardless, why is he still touting this product that's killing people?
[01:36:00.392 --> 01:36:02.053]  I don't care if you're left or right.
[01:36:02.634 --> 01:36:11.000]  These are wings of the same evil bird, and we have to remember that the whole goal is depopulation by shooting you up with their experimental poison.
[01:36:11.972 --> 01:36:17.975]  And a lot of you are probably going to say, oh, well, I don't care what he does, because this is about medical freedom, as long as we have the choice.
[01:36:18.375 --> 01:36:20.956]  He's not even giving you the choice!
[01:36:21.456 --> 01:36:24.878]  If you go to his hotel in New York, you have to show proof of papers.
[01:36:25.138 --> 01:36:27.599]  So how can you continue to blindly defend this man?
[01:36:27.799 --> 01:36:28.380]  I don't get it.
[01:36:28.680 --> 01:36:29.920]  Make it make sense, please.
[01:36:30.521 --> 01:36:32.301]  Trump do some great things while in office?
[01:36:32.702 --> 01:36:33.342]  Absolutely.
[01:36:33.642 --> 01:36:34.702]  Was I a supporter?
[01:36:35.063 --> 01:36:36.123]  I was a huge one.
[01:36:36.923 --> 01:36:39.445]  But there is no denying that what he is doing is evil.
[01:36:40.505 --> 01:36:48.912]  And if we continue to just support someone that does not have our best interest, then that makes us no better than the left.
[01:36:48.952 --> 01:36:54.957]  We have to be willing to come out and state when there's a problem, and I personally think that there is a huge problem.
[01:36:55.397 --> 01:36:57.339]  So it's time to stop trusting the plan.
[01:36:57.599 --> 01:37:01.943]  It's time to wake the fuck up, because nobody is coming to save you, and this is 100% on us.
[01:37:04.659 --> 01:37:06.282]  Wow, Alison Steinberg.
[01:37:06.663 --> 01:37:08.827]  She needs to be the next female president of the United States.
[01:37:08.968 --> 01:37:09.869]  Wow, I'm sold.
[01:37:09.929 --> 01:37:10.651]  I've seen her on Ellen.
[01:37:10.671 --> 01:37:11.473]  Big fan of her work.
[01:37:11.974 --> 01:37:13.997]  She is at Alison Wonderland forever.
[01:37:15.453 --> 01:37:21.661]  And we, Breezeway.com, Alison Steinberg, thank you for joining us on such short notice.
[01:37:21.941 --> 01:37:25.125]  When I saw the video on Twitter with millions of views, it didn't say your name.
[01:37:25.145 --> 01:37:26.667]  I'm like, she looks familiar.
[01:37:26.707 --> 01:37:27.247]  Who is she?
[01:37:27.488 --> 01:37:29.850]  Then I realized, oh, you've been on Owen's show a few times and I've watched you.
[01:37:30.171 --> 01:37:33.435]  So it's great to have you here, but wow, crazy times.
[01:37:33.455 --> 01:37:34.336]  Where do you want to start off?
[01:37:36.553 --> 01:37:38.655]  Thank you so much, Alex, for having me.
[01:37:38.695 --> 01:37:40.016]  It's such an honor to be on the show.
[01:37:40.036 --> 01:37:42.499]  I can't thank you enough for having me here.
[01:37:42.719 --> 01:37:49.004]  And I just am so grateful for everything that you're doing, because there's so few people that are willing to really speak the truth.
[01:37:49.225 --> 01:37:59.194]  And I'm kind of bad about what's really happening.
[01:37:59.774 --> 01:38:03.169]   And it's Hold on.
[01:38:03.289 --> 01:38:03.910]  Hold on, folks.
[01:38:03.950 --> 01:38:04.590]  No big deal.
[01:38:05.170 --> 01:38:06.270]  You know, the magic.
[01:38:06.350 --> 01:38:07.091]  It's like Star Trek.
[01:38:07.111 --> 01:38:10.952]  When you talk to somebody via Skype or Zoom, and then sometimes there's a problem, it's Murphy's Law.
[01:38:11.472 --> 01:38:13.132]  We're going to see if it stabilizes and go back to her.
[01:38:13.192 --> 01:38:13.933]  No need to thank me.
[01:38:13.973 --> 01:38:21.575]  We're very thankful to Alison Steinberg at Alison Wonderland Forever for what she's doing, speaking out.
[01:38:21.595 --> 01:38:24.756]  And we're not trying to attack Trump, but he's destroying himself.
[01:38:24.796 --> 01:38:26.056]  He's going down this avenue.
[01:38:26.736 --> 01:38:27.737]  Sorry, you got cut off there.
[01:38:27.757 --> 01:38:28.397]  What were you trying to say?
[01:38:32.637 --> 01:38:34.998]  Hi, can you hear me now?
[01:38:35.818 --> 01:38:38.619]  You just got cut off after saying you were honored to be on the show.
[01:38:38.639 --> 01:38:39.359]  We're honored to have you.
[01:38:39.379 --> 01:38:41.640]  Wow, this thing's gone super viral.
[01:38:41.660 --> 01:38:43.560]  You've done a lot of viral stuff, but this has gone super viral.
[01:38:43.580 --> 01:38:51.743]  All right, here's what we're going to do.
[01:38:52.003 --> 01:38:53.003]  Here's what we're going to do.
[01:38:53.023 --> 01:38:55.784]  We're going to get her on the phone and with the video, so it'll all be good.
[01:38:56.765 --> 01:38:58.145]  That's the fun of these shows, though.
[01:38:58.545 --> 01:39:00.986]  I used to have Michael Savage on before he basically retired.
[01:39:01.638 --> 01:39:03.662]  He said it's okay if you have technical difficulties sometime.
[01:39:03.681 --> 01:39:08.480]   It's like when he was a kid growing up in New York City and they'd watch like Mexican TV,
[01:39:08.480 --> 01:39:11.761]   that were you know, the local Mexicans doing the show, they're like puppets beating each other up at the head
[01:39:11.761 --> 01:39:14.761]   and then it'd be like a curtain falls down, you see the stuff going on,
[01:39:14.761 --> 01:39:20.240]   or you'd watch the local access TV magician and you know, this hat would catch on fire by accident.
[01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:21.681]  That's what's fun about all this.
[01:39:21.681 --> 01:39:27.421]   So we're gonna talk a few minutes here and get Allison Steinberg on via phone and video
[01:39:27.421 --> 01:39:31.900]   so we can talk to her, Allison Wonderland Forever on Twitter, she is amazing.
[01:39:32.841 --> 01:39:34.841]   In other words, it's my show where it has technical stuff on it.
[01:39:34.658 --> 01:39:35.619]  Owen's is crystal clear.
[01:39:36.300 --> 01:39:37.842]  Owen, by the way, is coming up at 3 p.m.
[01:39:37.882 --> 01:39:38.482]  Central today.
[01:39:39.143 --> 01:39:48.674]  But here we are, two hours and 13 minutes into this transmission, into this broadcast that I have not plugged today.
[01:39:50.100 --> 01:39:52.461]  And I'm the guy that needs to plug Defunder Operations.
[01:39:52.501 --> 01:39:53.882]  So I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:39:53.902 --> 01:39:59.545]  I want to encourage you, even though if you order something now, you're not going to get it by Christmas, obviously, but it doesn't matter.

[01:40:59.082 --> 01:41:05.465]  We have equations, everything about how Elon Musk, who's lately been talking about it, how they program you with these false programs.
[01:41:05.906 --> 01:41:07.186]  How do you get those programs off?
[01:41:07.386 --> 01:41:08.307]  By becoming aware of them.
[01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:10.541]  So is our program perfect?
[01:41:10.581 --> 01:41:14.804]  No, it's a human attempt to look at how this is happening in the third dimension and beyond.
[01:41:15.264 --> 01:41:16.625]  ResetWars.com.
[01:41:16.645 --> 01:41:18.586]  I want to thank you all that got Reset Wars.

[01:42:14.935 --> 01:42:19.378]  Tell ya, she's coming up straight ahead on the other side.
[01:42:19.878 --> 01:42:20.379]  Stay with us.
[01:42:22.480 --> 01:42:24.561]  Well, her video's gone super viral.
[01:42:24.681 --> 01:42:28.123]  Allison Steinberg at Allison Wonderland Forever.
[01:42:28.183 --> 01:42:29.324]  What a great name.
[01:42:29.964 --> 01:42:30.785]  She joins us here.
[01:42:30.805 --> 01:42:32.786]  She's joined InfoWars on Owen's show before.
[01:42:32.806 --> 01:42:38.455]   Great to have her on with us to give her take on What she says is a betrayal by President Trump.
[01:42:38.475 --> 01:42:40.135]  He's now doubled down with Candace Owens.
[01:42:40.575 --> 01:42:42.416]  Today, a clip of that's coming up next segment.
[01:42:42.436 --> 01:42:44.877]  He says, everybody dying hasn't had the shot.
[01:42:44.917 --> 01:42:46.197]  That's a total lie of Fauci.
[01:42:46.558 --> 01:42:47.158]  That's coming up.
[01:42:47.178 --> 01:42:48.638]  But this is a very sad moment.
[01:42:49.479 --> 01:42:53.600]  And why are you so concerned, Allison, as you put out that amazingly articulate video?
[01:42:53.620 --> 01:42:55.020]  But I wanted you to be able to elaborate.
[01:42:55.321 --> 01:42:56.321]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:42:58.055 --> 01:42:59.276]  Thank you again for having me.
[01:42:59.436 --> 01:43:00.736]  Alex, it's an honor to be here.
[01:43:00.756 --> 01:43:11.581]  It is extremely upsetting because I, you know, have been such a huge supporter of Trump all this time, and I really wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt, as I think so many other people did.
[01:43:12.022 --> 01:43:18.925]  And we seem to have, you know, made excuses for him for a long time, despite having this obvious evidence right in front of us.
[01:43:19.305 --> 01:43:26.187]   We just hoped that, you know, things would pan out and we would see the results that we needed for him, but now he's
[01:43:26.187 --> 01:43:32.387]   sitting here continuously backing Big Pharma and continuously begging for the attention of
[01:43:32.387 --> 01:43:38.087]   his supporters and wanting all of all this credit for something that we know is evil and
[01:43:38.087 --> 01:43:43.167]   is a bio weapon. So if he's not willing to speak out openly about it, if he's not willing to come
[01:43:43.167 --> 01:43:48.272]   clean about what's really I mean, do you think he's being blackmailed, or is he being pigheaded?
[01:43:48.112 --> 01:43:51.471]   overwhelming the hospital, then I think we have a real issue here and I think
[01:43:51.471 --> 01:43:54.672]   more people need to be open to that and wake up to the fact that he is not
[01:43:54.672 --> 01:43:59.752]   actually on our side anymore. I have to agree. I mean do you think he's being
[01:43:59.752 --> 01:44:04.971]   blackmailed or is he being pig-headed? What do you think is happening? Yeah I would
[01:44:04.971 --> 01:44:08.391]   imagine there's a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes that we obviously
[01:44:09.177 --> 01:44:25.892]  But, you know, at a certain point when people are dying and people are losing their jobs left and right and people no longer have a way of making a living or bringing money into their family, then you can't continuously back this product that's killing people and ruining lives.
[01:44:26.332 --> 01:44:30.676]  I don't know how anyone with a heart could continue down this path.
[01:44:32.752 --> 01:44:39.872]  I agree with you, and he's also letting people rot in jail and not making a big enough deal about the Q Shaman and stuff like that.
[01:44:41.067 --> 01:44:41.347]  I know!
[01:44:41.407 --> 01:44:43.988]  What about all the January 6th political prisoners?
[01:44:44.048 --> 01:44:45.308]  Where is he on that?
[01:44:45.388 --> 01:44:54.670]  I mean, we came there in support of him, we came there to defend him, we came there in the name of freedom, and he won't even, you know, help us out?
[01:44:54.930 --> 01:45:00.631]  There's people rotting away in prison, and he has no comment on that, so it's extremely upsetting.
[01:45:00.711 --> 01:45:07.672]  And I want to be a million percent clear, I'm not trying to curry favor with the Jan 6th Committee, I told them go to hell, or with the Democrats, I hope they burn in hell.
[01:45:08.452 --> 01:45:12.135]  It's that it's watching Trump join them and Biden defend them.
[01:45:12.155 --> 01:45:13.856]  It's just it's too much.
[01:45:13.916 --> 01:45:17.098]  Everybody I know that used to support Trump is really mad at him.
[01:45:17.138 --> 01:45:21.421]  He's really basically committing political suicide in front of us all, my dear.
[01:45:22.582 --> 01:45:23.002]  He is.
[01:45:23.082 --> 01:45:23.963]  I agree with that.
[01:45:24.463 --> 01:45:30.788]  But to me, what's sad is that now I'm personally experiencing a lot of attacks from people who are supposedly on our side.
[01:45:31.588 --> 01:45:32.789]  I should ask you that question.
[01:45:32.829 --> 01:45:33.790]  I'm not a good interviewer.
[01:45:33.810 --> 01:45:37.152]  What's been the response since you put out this video that's gone super viral?
[01:45:38.875 --> 01:45:40.275]  It's been a very mixed bag.
[01:45:40.695 --> 01:45:50.017]  Obviously, the liberals are having a heyday with it because they think that, oh, look, Trump is turning on his own supporters, this and that, which is ridiculous.
[01:45:50.357 --> 01:45:56.379]  They can't comprehend that we can form our own thoughts and opinions and we're not just going to blindly go along with whatever he says.
[01:45:56.719 --> 01:46:00.198]   But with that being said, then the more concerning issue is on the right,
[01:46:00.198 --> 01:46:04.597]   where so many people continue to defend him and make excuses and
[01:46:04.597 --> 01:46:10.038]   come up with these ridiculous reverse psychology tactics and 5D chess scenarios
[01:46:10.038 --> 01:46:16.597]   in which they think that he's actually doing good, when he's now outright stating that we are the problem.
[01:46:16.597 --> 01:46:22.988]   So I don't know how people can turn on me, like the people who are truly fighting for freedom, the
[01:46:22.988 --> 01:46:24.238]  real patriots here.
[01:46:24.238 --> 01:46:28.398]   They turn around and completely treat us like leftist by saying that we are shills
[01:46:28.398 --> 01:46:32.878]   and we are part of the problem and how dare we not trust Trump.
[01:46:32.878 --> 01:46:36.378]   And it's just upsetting to see because I feel like the whole goal is to divide us
[01:46:36.378 --> 01:46:39.118]   and now there's further division within our own community of people.
[01:46:39.118 --> 01:46:49.118]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:46:40.507 --> 01:46:41.567]  Well, that's why you're here.
[01:46:41.647 --> 01:46:43.228]  You say it better than I do.
[01:46:43.288 --> 01:46:45.088]  You really need a major talk show.
[01:46:45.789 --> 01:46:48.829]  Alison Steinberg, where do you expect this to go?
[01:46:48.909 --> 01:46:54.791]  Because even Jack Posobiec says he thinks Trump's being set up by the left with his defense of this so-called vaccine.
[01:46:57.743 --> 01:47:00.205]  I don't even know what's going to happen.
[01:47:00.245 --> 01:47:10.932]  It's a very scary time and unless everyone truly stands up and fights back and is willing to resist this, then I don't know what to say because, you know, I'm someone that's taking this very seriously.
[01:47:10.992 --> 01:47:19.777]  I will not miss an opportunity to shed some light on what's happening and it even goes down to things like not having a fake card or not getting yourself into the system.
[01:47:19.938 --> 01:47:27.766]   I feel like a lot of these so-called conservatives are actually quite weak And they're willing to just slide through the cracks so that their lives can stay easy.
[01:47:27.806 --> 01:47:29.709]  They're not really willing to fight for freedom.
[01:47:29.789 --> 01:47:30.530]  And that's what we need.
[01:47:30.570 --> 01:47:31.892]  We need real freedom fighters.
[01:47:32.192 --> 01:47:36.318]  And unless everyone gets on board with that, then you're ultimately just going to become a part of the system.
[01:47:36.539 --> 01:47:37.320]  And we can't have that.
[01:47:37.907 --> 01:47:40.269]  Well, Allison, you just knocked it out of the park.
[01:47:40.329 --> 01:47:41.010]  I mean, that's what this is.
[01:47:41.050 --> 01:47:48.677]  We've got to get out of our comfort zones and not just go have Republican events where everybody's a rock star and, oh, look, Kyle Rittenhouse comes out on stage.
[01:47:48.737 --> 01:47:49.538]  Nothing against that.
[01:47:49.938 --> 01:47:55.323]  But if you're not then saying, let's march, let's go out, let's vote, let's get aggressive, let's file lawsuits.
[01:47:55.403 --> 01:48:01.589]  I mean, if you're not challenging and letting the Republican Party adopt the globalist agenda, well, then you're just as bad as the enemy.
[01:48:02.845 --> 01:48:04.966]  Exactly, and we're not seeing enough of that.
[01:48:05.006 --> 01:48:13.588]  I know there are people who are, you know, this is the hill that they will die on, but we're not seeing enough pushback from people on our side, and this is a result of weak leadership.
[01:48:13.828 --> 01:48:19.470]  I mean, even Rand Paul wants to introduce a new vaccine, and we don't have people talking about the real issue here.
[01:48:19.490 --> 01:48:28.472]  I don't think people are comprehending the fact that this is a bioweapon, and they're completely overlooking the fact that the New World Order is here, and this is what they're using to usher it in.
[01:48:28.592 --> 01:48:31.933]  So people need to fight like their life literally depends on it, because it does.
[01:48:34.025 --> 01:48:42.355]  So, I've asked a lot of questions and I've got plenty of questions, but what else do you want to get out to the audience here?
[01:48:42.475 --> 01:48:48.161]  I would like to say that people need to stand up and be more hardcore about what they believe in.
[01:48:48.181 --> 01:48:55.334]   Stop blindly defending people that You know, don't necessarily have your back.
[01:48:56.054 --> 01:49:00.437]  I feel betrayed by Trump, and I can't imagine how anyone wouldn't feel that way at this point.
[01:49:01.017 --> 01:49:07.400]  So I think people just need to be more open-minded, and I think ultimately we need to focus on unity, because that's the only way we're going to override this.
[01:49:07.580 --> 01:49:15.384]  Because if we keep fighting within our little sectors, then we're not going to accomplish anything, and it's just going to make it easier for the enemy to attack.
[01:49:15.464 --> 01:49:18.445]  So I just hope that people can be more open-minded.
[01:49:18.485 --> 01:49:20.046]  I hope that people continue to resist.
[01:49:21.954 --> 01:49:24.656]  I hope that everyone just sees what's really happening here.
[01:49:25.437 --> 01:49:26.598]  I've been fighting really hard.
[01:49:26.698 --> 01:49:36.406]  I go out into the streets and interview people myself to try to get the public to weigh in, and it just seems like a losing battle at this point because so many people are just already so far gone.
[01:49:37.888 --> 01:49:41.291]  You're out in San Diego, right?
[01:49:41.511 --> 01:49:42.992]  I am in Southern California.
[01:49:43.473 --> 01:49:45.374]  I go back and forth between L.A.
[01:49:45.394 --> 01:49:46.115]  and Orange County.
[01:49:46.315 --> 01:49:47.836]  Yeah, I just saw you on a local show.
[01:49:47.856 --> 01:49:48.437]  I was guessing that.
[01:49:49.068 --> 01:49:50.869]  I mean, that really is a fallen place.
[01:49:50.889 --> 01:49:51.889]  There's so many good people there.
[01:49:51.909 --> 01:49:52.689]  That's the paradox.
[01:49:52.749 --> 01:49:54.450]  But it's such a beautiful state, too.
[01:49:54.490 --> 01:49:57.170]  But I can't say you're wrong.
[01:49:57.210 --> 01:50:04.472]  I mean, we are really losing this fight, not because the people aren't supporting freedom, but because they're not fighting for their freedom.
[01:50:04.893 --> 01:50:06.333]  So how do we fight for our freedom?
[01:50:08.351 --> 01:50:13.617]  I think just banding together with your community, finding like-minded people.
[01:50:13.657 --> 01:50:18.703]  People do need to be more open-minded instead of immediately bashing you for having an alternative thought.
[01:50:18.923 --> 01:50:27.813]   I mean, the right criticizes the left for not being open-minded and not being able to have an opinion and not being able to I don't think so.
[01:50:27.632 --> 01:50:31.471]   of view, but now I feel like the right is treating us the same way and has the same
[01:50:31.471 --> 01:50:37.152]   tactics as the left. So people need to be more accepting of alternative views. Maybe we don't
[01:50:37.152 --> 01:50:40.912]   agree on everything, but we need to all come together. And we also need to focus on having
[01:50:40.912 --> 01:50:47.632]   conversations individually. Like a lot of people like to talk so loud and openly on social media,
[01:50:47.632 --> 01:50:51.872]   but where are they when it comes to real life? They say that they're not going to comply and
[01:50:51.872 --> 01:50:58.831]   they say that they're anti-communist and all this stuff, but then they suddenly have a mask on just
[01:50:58.831 --> 01:51:02.512]   to get in to eat. Well that's right, but you're putting your money where your mouth is. Allison
[01:51:02.512 --> 01:51:09.632]  Steinberg, let's come back with this clip. Stay with us.
[01:51:09.711 --> 01:51:19.472]  [Music]
[01:51:19.657 --> 01:51:26.499]  You say that you wanna go to a land that's far away.
[01:51:27.279 --> 01:51:35.161]  How are we supposed to get there with the way that we're living today?
[01:51:36.522 --> 01:51:40.583]  You talk lots about God.
[01:51:40.843 --> 01:51:43.624]  Freedom comes from the call.
[01:51:43.463 --> 01:51:53.463]   But that's not what this bitch wants Not what I want at all, I want
[01:51:53.463 --> 01:52:00.463]   Money, power, glory You can say there's too many people
[01:52:00.293 --> 01:52:02.194]  You can say we need to depopulate them.
[01:52:02.694 --> 01:52:03.414]  Maybe you're right.
[01:52:04.014 --> 01:52:04.915]  But who chooses?
[01:52:06.275 --> 01:52:09.116]  And the people running this whole thing are the very worst of us.
[01:52:09.316 --> 01:52:12.037]  They're the ones that should walk the plank first.
[01:52:12.938 --> 01:52:14.038]  Show us how to die.
[01:52:14.699 --> 01:52:16.939]  Kill yourselves, Bill Gates and Fauci.
[01:52:17.740 --> 01:52:18.520]  Kill yourself.
[01:52:19.520 --> 01:52:20.841]  And then we might listen to you.
[01:52:21.954 --> 01:52:27.378]  Lead us by example, or shut your filthy and red mouths up.
[01:52:29.479 --> 01:52:39.025]  You're all going to the Reps team, right?
[01:52:39.205 --> 01:52:41.967]  All right, joining us via the telephone is Allison Steinberg.
[01:52:43.459 --> 01:52:47.942]  And she's got the best little two-minute rant I've seen exposing this whole damn thing and everything she does is awesome.
[01:52:48.422 --> 01:52:50.363]  Allison, tell me what you do full-time.
[01:52:50.383 --> 01:52:59.568]  I want to learn more about you and just what you're up to and just your views on the world and where you think this is all going because, you know, I don't want to attack Trump.
[01:52:59.608 --> 01:53:01.109]  I made major investments in Trump.
[01:53:01.149 --> 01:53:02.269]  I got sued over Trump.
[01:53:02.329 --> 01:53:03.650]  I got persecuted.
[01:53:03.670 --> 01:53:07.132]  They're trying to put me in prison with the January 6th Committee over Trump.
[01:53:08.539 --> 01:53:13.602]  And that's what makes it so bad when you've invested so much in somebody to watch him go sideways.
[01:53:14.122 --> 01:53:17.664]  I've got more anger at him than I've got against Hillary Clinton, because I know she's evil.
[01:53:18.885 --> 01:53:19.665]  I know she's bad.
[01:53:20.185 --> 01:53:21.606]  I know she's forsaken everybody.
[01:53:21.926 --> 01:53:24.708]  But with Trump, it's particularly personal.
[01:53:25.348 --> 01:53:26.829]  Is that where this is coming from for you?
[01:53:26.849 --> 01:53:30.011]  Because it seemed personal in that beautiful rant you did.
[01:53:31.171 --> 01:53:35.233]  Well, absolutely it's personal, because I've dedicated so much of my life to this.
[01:53:36.493 --> 01:53:39.014]  It's harder for this than anything in my entire life.
[01:53:39.034 --> 01:53:41.094]  I've lost friends and family over it.
[01:53:41.194 --> 01:53:49.877]  So to ultimately be betrayed and now left in the dust and just completely on our own to fight for this, yeah, it's beyond upsetting.
[01:53:49.897 --> 01:53:51.517]  So I can't even imagine how you feel.
[01:53:52.557 --> 01:54:00.860]  But coming from someone who has put their life and career on the line for this, I mean, I have no choice but to speak up about it now.
[01:54:00.900 --> 01:54:05.101]  And I would hope that many others would be doing the same because I know I'm not the only one in this situation.
[01:54:07.145 --> 01:54:08.326]  I totally agree.
[01:54:08.346 --> 01:54:11.810]  So again, I've always got questions, but what else is on your amazing radar screen?
[01:54:13.912 --> 01:54:15.774]  Well, you asked what I do.
[01:54:15.814 --> 01:54:17.777]  I'm a makeup artist for a living.
[01:54:17.797 --> 01:54:23.667]   I have Left my job because they wanted to enforce all of these ridiculous mandates.
[01:54:23.807 --> 01:54:28.529]  And so I went out and started doing freelance work on my own, which has been fantastic.
[01:54:28.589 --> 01:54:37.154]  But, you know, along with all of the speaking out about my disagreements about everything going on, I've I've lost a lot of clients.
[01:54:37.234 --> 01:54:44.837]  And it does put me at risk for my clients knowing about my stance, which can obviously get you canceled in today's world.
[01:54:46.826 --> 01:54:49.729]  So I just, you know, at this point, I don't even care.
[01:54:49.789 --> 01:54:51.571]  It's not it's not about that.
[01:54:51.611 --> 01:54:58.559]  Like, I will scrub toilets if I have to, because at the end of the day, all I care about is truth and exposing that and staying consistent with that.
[01:54:59.200 --> 01:55:07.750]  And I got to tell you right now, I saw you about a year ago with Owen or over a year ago, and I said, oh, and you need to hire her as a reporter in California.
[01:55:08.693 --> 01:55:12.455]  And then you're like, yeah, well, she's doing her own thing, but I don't have a bunch of extra money.
[01:55:12.855 --> 01:55:21.180]  But I really want to talk to you if you can find a camera person and some work to have you do interviews and stuff, but also your own rants, because you're I mean, I know talent when I see it.
[01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:22.341]  And you're not just a beautiful woman.
[01:55:22.601 --> 01:55:23.861]  That's like a side asset.
[01:55:23.901 --> 01:55:24.662]  You're really smart.
[01:55:25.042 --> 01:55:26.002]  You should be a pundit.
[01:55:26.023 --> 01:55:32.106]  I mean, I'm not trying to knock the other some of the people on Fox News, but you're a lot smarter than some of the best info babes they've got.
[01:55:32.166 --> 01:55:34.807]  And you're just as smart or smarter than the best men they've got.
[01:55:35.167 --> 01:55:36.688]  I mean, everybody can hear her on air.
[01:55:36.708 --> 01:55:37.729]  She's smart as she gets.
[01:55:38.449 --> 01:55:39.890]  As sharp as a dagger here.
[01:55:40.230 --> 01:55:41.850]  So we need you in the fight full time.
[01:55:41.891 --> 01:55:42.611]  That's all I'm saying.
[01:55:44.031 --> 01:55:46.592]  Alex, that is the biggest honor I could ever imagine.
[01:55:46.632 --> 01:55:47.413]  Thank you so much.
[01:55:47.493 --> 01:55:52.275]  I would absolutely love to work for you or do whatever it takes to expose this stuff.
[01:55:52.295 --> 01:55:54.355]  At the end of the day, that's like I said, all I care about.
[01:55:54.395 --> 01:55:55.876]  And it's my top priority right now.
[01:55:55.896 --> 01:55:59.537]  I don't care if you worked at the Blaze or Tucker Carlson or for us.
[01:56:00.018 --> 01:56:00.898]  It needs to happen.
[01:56:01.438 --> 01:56:03.739]  I mean, I mean, my Lord, you need your own show.
[01:56:03.779 --> 01:56:06.120]  You need to be wrecking ball in these people every day.
[01:56:07.509 --> 01:56:08.910]  I would love nothing more.
[01:56:09.351 --> 01:56:10.852]  I've dedicated so much time to this.
[01:56:10.912 --> 01:56:13.394]  At this point, I'm just ready to go all-in.
[01:56:14.214 --> 01:56:25.683]  It's very time-consuming, as I'm sure you know, and you've dedicated your entire life to it, but that's all that matters anymore, because if we don't fight like hell, we won't have anything left to fight for.
[01:56:25.763 --> 01:56:31.107]  So I'm ready to go all-in, and whatever opportunity comes my way, I am more than happy to.
[01:56:31.147 --> 01:56:31.888]  Well, I think that's beautiful.
[01:56:31.928 --> 01:56:33.109]  I mean, you're obviously all-in.
[01:56:33.129 --> 01:56:34.410]  That's what's so powerful about it.
[01:56:34.850 --> 01:56:35.951]  Because I saw your other interviews.
[01:56:35.971 --> 01:56:39.033]  They were powerful, but you were really better than I could do.
[01:56:39.753 --> 01:56:43.095]  You did a better job than I could do in two minutes of just eviscerating Trump.
[01:56:43.515 --> 01:56:49.459]  And that's why so many of his minions got mad at you, because they're guilty about the fact that they're still signed on to Trump.
[01:56:49.879 --> 01:56:51.880]  I want to make Trump get back on the straight and narrow.
[01:56:51.920 --> 01:56:54.742]  If he isn't going to get back on the straight and narrow, I mean, I'm sorry.
[01:56:54.762 --> 01:56:58.984]  We'll take the good he did as good, but we're going to take the bad he did as happening currently.
[01:56:59.004 --> 01:57:02.286]  And, you know, we're not going to be, at least in my view, supporting Trump.
[01:57:03.815 --> 01:57:05.537]  Yeah, that's kind of where we're at.
[01:57:05.577 --> 01:57:09.061]  It's sad that it's had to come to this, but I don't think we have a choice at this point.
[01:57:09.101 --> 01:57:18.412]  Like, we all know what the end goal is here, so if someone's going to sit there and continuously defend it when we know what's happening, then it would be wrong of us to do that.
[01:57:18.432 --> 01:57:21.014]  That makes us no better than the liberals, so we have no choice.
[01:57:21.035 --> 01:57:27.814]   Well, it's like Tony Montana says in that great script written by Oliver Stone back in the 80s,
[01:57:27.814 --> 01:57:30.373]  the only thing we've got is our word and our will.
[01:57:30.373 --> 01:57:31.733]  Our word and our will.
[01:57:31.733 --> 01:57:34.533]  And so I'm not breaking it for anybody.
[01:57:34.533 --> 01:57:35.972]  And I want Trump to be good.
[01:57:35.972 --> 01:57:37.014]  I want to support Trump.
[01:57:37.014 --> 01:57:38.052]  I believed in him.
[01:57:38.052 --> 01:57:43.332]   But we can't compromise ourselves because our previous leader has sold out his ideals.
[01:57:43.332 --> 01:57:45.012]  I mean, it's that simple.
[01:57:45.012 --> 01:57:46.934]  So Trump needs to know that.
[01:57:46.934 --> 01:57:49.253]  Absolutely.
[01:57:49.602 --> 01:57:50.662]  And I don't know.
[01:57:50.682 --> 01:57:56.185]  I mean, you would think that he would, seeing as every time he brings a vaccine up at a rally, he gets booed.
[01:57:56.205 --> 01:57:59.287]  And now he's just dismissing it.
[01:57:59.307 --> 01:58:05.010]  I mean, at this latest thing, the latest interview, he just boos everyone and shuts them up.
[01:58:05.130 --> 01:58:11.454]  So I think he knows how we feel, but he's just so intense on getting credit for everything.
[01:58:11.494 --> 01:58:13.895]  And he's obviously a bit of a narcissist.
[01:58:13.915 --> 01:58:24.626]   So I don't know where The issue is here, but you would think that if he really cared about his supporters and the people that have endlessly defended him, that he would be doing a little bit more to appease us.
[01:58:24.686 --> 01:58:25.567]  Well, you're right.
[01:58:25.587 --> 01:58:29.191]  That's the worst part, is he points at the crowd and says, oh, you're a small group, willingly.
[01:58:29.935 --> 01:58:31.295]  Like, oh look, they're small.
[01:58:31.355 --> 01:58:32.256]  No, it wasn't small.
[01:58:32.536 --> 01:58:40.518]  The majority of Trump supporters see through Fauci, see through Bill Gates, see through Joe Biden, and now to have Joe Biden defending Trump?
[01:58:40.978 --> 01:58:42.918]  Doesn't Trump get that's not good optics?
[01:58:42.978 --> 01:58:44.359]  This guy that stole the election?
[01:58:44.659 --> 01:58:46.399]  The guy that has a 20% approval rating?
[01:58:46.639 --> 01:58:48.300]  I mean, what the hell's wrong with Trump?
[01:58:49.960 --> 01:58:50.640]  I don't know.
[01:58:50.920 --> 01:58:53.701]  I don't know how much more frightening I can get.
[01:58:53.721 --> 01:59:00.118]   This is about as close to I don't know what more people need to see.
[01:59:00.118 --> 01:59:04.278]   If Biden and Trump are on the same page, then that should be the ultimate red flag.
[01:59:04.278 --> 01:59:09.557]   And I don't know how anyone can continue to back this or say that there's some strategy behind this
[01:59:09.557 --> 01:59:12.918]   because at the end of the day, he's telling us everything we need to know.
[01:59:12.918 --> 01:59:18.637]   And you either are going to be willing to accept this unfortunate information,
[01:59:18.637 --> 01:59:20.637]  or you're gonna keep lying to yourself.
[01:59:20.637 --> 01:59:26.157]   And maybe that's the route some people need to take if you need to pretend that there's some hope for you
[01:59:26.157 --> 01:59:28.477]  just by blindly believing in Trump.
[01:59:28.477 --> 01:59:30.197]  And I guess that's what you have to do.
[01:59:30.197 --> 01:59:32.638]  It's really sad, but you're not a true fighter then.
[01:59:32.638 --> 01:59:34.398]  You have to be willing to wake up to the fact.
[01:59:34.398 --> 01:59:36.597]  And they're sitting here right in front of us now.
[01:59:36.603 --> 01:59:48.221]   Well Allison I'm no rocket scientist but I'm also not a Turnip farmer, and I can tell people, clearly all the criminal investigations on Trump, he's done nothing wrong, clearly have finally gotten to him.
[01:59:48.241 --> 01:59:50.805]  Well, they got criminal investigations open on me, I'm not rolling over.
[01:59:51.666 --> 01:59:53.368]  And so, what is Trump going to think?
[01:59:53.388 --> 01:59:56.812]  He's going to roll over, and then he's going to endorse this, they're going to leave him alone?
[01:59:57.312 --> 02:00:00.016]  At the end of the day, I just can't be part of it anymore.
[02:00:01.374 --> 02:00:02.115]  I can't either.
[02:00:03.015 --> 02:00:05.177]  The vaccine is where I draw the line.
[02:00:05.277 --> 02:00:12.923]  I've been willing to overlook a lot of other questionable things from the past, but I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt.
[02:00:12.963 --> 02:00:13.704]  But here we are.
[02:00:13.724 --> 02:00:15.105]  I can't get behind the vaccine.
[02:00:15.145 --> 02:00:16.205]  We know that it's a bioweapon.
[02:00:16.245 --> 02:00:17.667]  We know it's designed to depopulate.
[02:00:17.687 --> 02:00:19.368]  We know how dangerous it is.
[02:00:19.588 --> 02:00:20.949]  People are losing their jobs over it.
[02:00:21.189 --> 02:00:22.010]  It's disgusting.
[02:00:22.050 --> 02:00:22.831]  It's despicable.
[02:00:23.031 --> 02:00:28.475]  And as someone who's pro-America, he should be doing a lot more to fight this, and he should be exposing the truth.
[02:00:30.116 --> 02:00:30.896]  You're right, Alison.
[02:00:31.577 --> 02:00:34.999]  It's a very sad moment to be live, but in a way it's also a good moment.
[02:00:35.259 --> 02:00:37.581]  It's paradoxical because we get to meet great people like you.
[02:00:38.001 --> 02:00:42.204]  We're going to find out who people really are in this day and age, in this incredible time.
[02:00:42.844 --> 02:00:48.227]  Final segment with Alison Steinberg of Alison Wonderland Forever on Twitter when we come back.
[02:00:48.768 --> 02:00:53.151]  And then we've got Kate Dolly taking over in the fourth hour.
[02:00:53.211 --> 02:00:53.611]  Stay with us.
[02:00:54.244 --> 02:00:57.126]  We are living in an incredible time.
[02:00:57.186 --> 02:01:01.489]  That Dr. Zelenko interview last hour was over-the-top powerful.
[02:01:01.509 --> 02:01:02.490]  I hope everybody shares it.
[02:01:02.890 --> 02:01:04.611]  That's how we save lives and expose this.
[02:01:05.272 --> 02:01:18.300]  Alison Steinberg is a makeup artist, has been an activist for years, promoting Trump, promoting freedom, been persecuted massively for it, put out a super viral video that even when I saw it, I was like, I recognize her, but who is that?
[02:01:18.340 --> 02:01:20.462]  They cut her name off and attacked her.
[02:01:21.161 --> 02:01:24.039]  And then now she's got Republicans attacking her as well.
[02:01:24.039 --> 02:01:27.221]  You can find her at Allison Wonderland Forever.
[02:01:27.221 --> 02:01:34.140]   Allison, in the 10 minutes we've got left, I just wanna hear from you as a woman, as an American,
[02:01:34.140 --> 02:01:36.520]  and where you think all this is going.
[02:01:36.520 --> 02:01:43.801]   Well, I think this is going to a very scary place if we don't act quickly.
[02:01:43.829 --> 02:01:59.093]  We've obviously been trying to do whatever we can over the last several years to counteract this, but unless everyone gets on board and unless everyone stands up hardcore and fights like their life depends on it, I fear what the future holds.
[02:01:59.233 --> 02:02:12.396]   I don't put my faith in the government, but in God, and unless we all get right with God, as you always say, then Then I'm scared to see what comes of this, but I think we do still have hope.
[02:02:12.556 --> 02:02:22.239]  I think that if everyone, you know, put their money where their mouth is, and I think if everyone actively resisted and, you know, especially vote with your dollar.
[02:02:22.279 --> 02:02:25.840]  I mean, we know votes don't really matter, but that's the one vote that does.
[02:02:25.920 --> 02:02:33.822]  So if everyone stopped spending money on stupid things that are owned by communist businesses here and there, then that would make a massive impact.
[02:02:35.483 --> 02:02:44.792]  One more reason to support the InfoWar and support your products, because we can't be giving our money to these people that are in support of this evil agenda.
[02:02:44.972 --> 02:02:45.913]  It's really on us.
[02:02:46.434 --> 02:02:47.454]  I said that in the video.
[02:02:47.775 --> 02:02:51.578]  It's on us, 100%, and you're going to have to make some sacrifices.
[02:02:51.619 --> 02:02:55.763]  No one ever said it was going to be easy, but we've had it easy for so long.
[02:02:55.943 --> 02:02:59.111]   We've had I totally agree with you.
[02:02:58.951 --> 02:03:02.551]   for so many years and now we're getting to the hard part and people have to be
[02:03:02.551 --> 02:03:08.110]  willing to do things that are not easy to keep our freedoms.
[02:03:08.110 --> 02:03:11.841]   If we want any chance of having this nice easy life that has been created
[02:03:11.841 --> 02:03:16.110]   for us then we need to continue to fight for it. I totally agree with you.
[02:03:16.110 --> 02:03:19.810]   Where do you see Trump going from here? He's made a big deal about Trump. He
[02:03:19.810 --> 02:03:21.030]  allowed himself to be censored.
[02:03:21.103 --> 02:03:22.365]  He allowed us to be censored.
[02:03:22.926 --> 02:03:24.529]  And now he's been kind of isolated.
[02:03:24.609 --> 02:03:29.036]  And I mean, did he make a deal to come out for the poison vaccines and be left alone?
[02:03:29.196 --> 02:03:32.161]  Or does he just think that's his legacy, so he's doubling down?
[02:03:34.540 --> 02:03:37.803]  I still don't quite know what to take away from Trump.
[02:03:37.863 --> 02:03:44.989]  It's obviously extremely upsetting to see him speaking out about it the way he is, but I don't know if he's ultimately in on it.
[02:03:45.049 --> 02:03:53.956]  I don't know if it's all just this political theater used to create two sides and divide us up, because we all know the evil divide and conquer tactics.
[02:03:55.620 --> 02:04:05.064]  I don't know if he's secretly behind this or if he did have our best interest and is just trying to appease everyone at this point, but he should know better.
[02:04:05.124 --> 02:04:08.085]  He should know that you can't be weak in this.
[02:04:09.722 --> 02:04:11.984]  Continuously just try to squeeze both sides.
[02:04:12.064 --> 02:04:16.967]  You either, uh, you can't live with the system or seek your way around it.
[02:04:16.987 --> 02:04:19.929]  You either have to defy it or you're going to end up endorsing it.
[02:04:20.489 --> 02:04:22.090]  And it seems like he's endorsing it.
[02:04:22.150 --> 02:04:27.554]  So I don't, I don't know how much longer we can hold out waiting for him.
[02:04:27.594 --> 02:04:36.000]  I don't know what this means for him ultimately, but, uh, it's really concerning and I think, uh, people should start being more open-minded to that.
[02:04:37.054 --> 02:04:38.415]  Well, I mean, absolutely.
[02:04:38.495 --> 02:04:41.437]  Trump rode in on the populist, anti-globalist wave.
[02:04:42.177 --> 02:04:46.159]  And if he wants to get off the wave and be with Fauci and be with Biden, that's fine.
[02:04:46.720 --> 02:04:48.881]  But it's about our choice now.
[02:04:48.941 --> 02:04:50.402]  We're not going to be with that.
[02:04:50.842 --> 02:04:53.324]  And Bill O'Reilly, I mean, this is really pathetic.
[02:04:54.785 --> 02:04:56.846]  It's very pathetic.
[02:04:57.566 --> 02:04:59.247]  I just, I don't know.
[02:04:59.267 --> 02:05:11.426]   It's stressful because Obviously, so many people were waiting for him and holding out for him and find ways to justify every little thing that he does, but I don't know.
[02:05:11.566 --> 02:05:12.887]  I don't know where this goes from here.
[02:05:12.907 --> 02:05:15.609]  It seems like he's in connections with all of the wrong people.
[02:05:15.689 --> 02:05:20.233]  He continues to defend Fauci, who's the root of all of this evil.
[02:05:20.413 --> 02:05:24.456]  I mean, if he really had our best interests, why wouldn't he have fired him long ago?
[02:05:24.596 --> 02:05:29.760]  Why does he continue to back these people and make excuses for people that are clearly not on our side?
[02:05:30.959 --> 02:05:33.441]  Well, I mean, Bill O'Reilly is an establishment con man.
[02:05:33.901 --> 02:05:46.590]  And again, moving on from Trump, if he wants to make himself non-essential by pushing this tyranny, because, you know, when he says the vaccine's good, he's lying, because it doesn't protect you.
[02:05:47.210 --> 02:05:49.552]  In fact, we have the can of so-and-so's clip.
[02:05:49.572 --> 02:05:50.192]  I want to play this.
[02:05:50.713 --> 02:05:57.878]  Trump says most Americans dying are unvaccinated and encourages everyone to get the shot.
[02:05:57.938 --> 02:05:58.318]  Here it is.
[02:05:59.747 --> 02:06:03.008]  Big Pharma, which is a huge topic on the minds of mothers, especially.
[02:06:03.028 --> 02:06:04.989]  You're seeing what's happening at these school board meetings.
[02:06:05.369 --> 02:06:07.110]  Where do you stand on these vaccine mandates?
[02:06:07.130 --> 02:06:09.331]  And obviously, I know that you are you are pro-vaccine.
[02:06:09.371 --> 02:06:11.392]  Obviously, you did everything you could to get this vaccine out.
[02:06:11.472 --> 02:06:15.813]  I know it was one of the greatest achievements we did in less than nine months to be able to do that.
[02:06:15.833 --> 02:06:18.134]  But now it's taken a twist, right?
[02:06:18.254 --> 02:06:24.276]  It's gotten now we went from this is a good thing and people should have this option to military men.
[02:06:24.516 --> 02:06:27.738]  You're going to have to resign because you're not getting this vaccine.
[02:06:27.758 --> 02:06:28.558]  Where do you stand on that?
[02:06:28.578 --> 02:06:32.674]  Well, I stand on forget about the mandates that people have to have their freedom, but at the same time...
[02:06:33.477 --> 02:06:37.040]  The vaccine is one of the greatest achievements of mankind.
[02:06:37.560 --> 02:06:43.524]  We would have had a 1917, remember the Spanish flu, killed perhaps a hundred million people.
[02:06:44.005 --> 02:06:50.469]  Actually, it ended the First World War because the soldiers were so, a lot of people don't know that, the soldiers got so sick, it was a terrible thing.
[02:06:50.509 --> 02:06:52.051]  There were no vaccines, there were no anything.
[02:06:52.111 --> 02:06:57.174]  I came up with a vaccine, with three vaccines, all are very, very good.
[02:06:57.715 --> 02:07:01.898]  Came up with three of them in less than nine months, it was supposed to take five to twelve years.
[02:07:02.618 --> 02:07:07.722]  And yet more people have died under COVID this year, by the way, under Joe Biden, than under you.
[02:07:07.782 --> 02:07:13.906]  And more people took the vaccine this year, so people are questioning how... Well, no, the vaccine worked, but some people aren't taking it.
[02:07:14.206 --> 02:07:18.269]  The ones that get very sick and go to the hospital are the ones that don't take their vaccine.
[02:07:18.670 --> 02:07:20.331]  But it's still their choice.
[02:07:21.087 --> 02:07:22.848]  And if you take the vaccine, you're protected.
[02:07:22.868 --> 02:07:25.290]  Look, the results of the vaccine are very good.
[02:07:25.470 --> 02:07:28.293]  And if you do get it, it's a very minor form.
[02:07:28.853 --> 02:07:30.734]  People aren't dying when they take the vaccine.
[02:07:30.754 --> 02:07:31.935]  What about the masking of children?
[02:07:32.195 --> 02:07:33.316]  That's that's a big one for moms right now.
[02:07:33.336 --> 02:07:34.357]  I think it's a terrible thing.
[02:07:34.537 --> 02:07:35.578]  I think it's a terrible thing.
[02:07:35.598 --> 02:07:36.879]  That flies in the face of science.
[02:07:36.919 --> 02:07:39.601]  The kids have a virtual zero percent chance of dying of COVID.
[02:07:39.641 --> 02:07:42.143]  And yet they're insisting on these vaccine mandates.
[02:07:42.343 --> 02:07:47.307]  I mean, I'm sorry, on these masking mandates and now even the vaccine mandates for small children.
[02:07:47.347 --> 02:07:48.828]  And what's going on there?
[02:07:48.968 --> 02:07:55.052]  I think what's happening is you look at the masks where Fauci and a lot of other people said masks don't mean anything.
[02:07:55.112 --> 02:07:57.013]  All of a sudden he becomes a radical masker.
[02:07:57.614 --> 02:07:59.675]  I don't like to see the kids with the masks on.
[02:07:59.695 --> 02:08:00.516]  They're sitting in school.
[02:08:00.536 --> 02:08:02.137]  They have a hard enough time sitting in school.
[02:08:02.157 --> 02:08:02.777]  It's like China.
[02:08:02.957 --> 02:08:03.998]  I've been to China.
[02:08:04.058 --> 02:08:07.560]  Well, and yet China's education system is a hell of a lot better than ours.
[02:08:07.600 --> 02:08:08.041]  You know what?
[02:08:08.481 --> 02:08:10.762]  They're rated number two or three and we're rated number 44.
[02:08:12.529 --> 02:08:15.271]  But masking children, I mean, the way it looks, right?
[02:08:15.351 --> 02:08:17.632]  It doesn't look like a free country.
[02:08:17.972 --> 02:08:18.452]  I'm against.
[02:08:18.913 --> 02:08:20.614]  It's beyond a free country, it's a cult.
[02:08:20.734 --> 02:08:26.597]  So, you know, the mask is much better than a GMO shot that turns off their white blood cells, Alison Steinberg.
[02:08:28.988 --> 02:08:30.729]  Yeah, well, I don't know.
[02:08:30.749 --> 02:08:38.371]  This mask is destroying the lives of so many, and I feel so terribly for these poor kids who are muzzled up and can't even have a social life or any normal human interaction.
[02:08:38.691 --> 02:08:41.312]  I mean, think about the effect this is going to have on the kids long term.
[02:08:41.632 --> 02:08:44.213]  They have no hope at having any normal life.
[02:08:44.253 --> 02:08:55.338]   I know so many parents of children who the kids are just totally unable to So, do we have to discard Trump, and what does that look like going into the next election?
[02:08:55.358 --> 02:08:57.259]  I mean, who would we vote for?
[02:08:57.299 --> 02:08:57.460]  DeSantis?
[02:08:57.300 --> 02:09:02.099]  that he's not even willing to speak on that is beyond infuriating.
[02:09:02.099 --> 02:09:08.340]   So, do we have to discard Trump and what does that look like going into the next election?
[02:09:08.340 --> 02:09:10.180]  I mean, who would we vote for?
[02:09:10.180 --> 02:09:11.180]  DeSantis?
[02:09:11.180 --> 02:09:13.619]  Who else?
[02:09:13.619 --> 02:09:14.619]  I don't know.
[02:09:14.953 --> 02:09:16.973]  At this point, I'm just so skeptical of everyone.
[02:09:16.993 --> 02:09:24.056]  I think all of these establishment people are hiding something, and I think they're all in on the vaccine.
[02:09:24.096 --> 02:09:28.118]  I think they all have money and big pharma, and I just don't know who to trust anymore.
[02:09:28.158 --> 02:09:29.479]  That's why I think you should be president.
[02:09:31.100 --> 02:09:34.002]  Well, I'm definitely trustworthy, except I'm so crazy.
[02:09:34.343 --> 02:09:43.730]  But listen, I would love to get you doing reporting for us out on the West Coast, and I really appreciate you spending this time with us right before Christmas, and hopefully you'll come back again soon.
[02:09:43.770 --> 02:09:48.234]  I love watching you on Owen, and as soon as we get your Skype fixed, I would love to get you on as a regular guest here.
[02:09:48.595 --> 02:09:52.698]  In the minute and a half we have left here, what are your predictions for 2022?
[02:09:52.538 --> 02:10:03.858]   for 2022? I think that we will hopefully see it flip but I don't know.
[02:10:01.964 --> 02:10:02.325]  I'm not.
[02:10:02.885 --> 02:10:03.805]  I'm just not confident.
[02:10:03.845 --> 02:10:10.949]  I just know how everything is rigged and I know that we don't really have much faith in the system anymore.
[02:10:11.109 --> 02:10:22.556]  So I think we need to focus on the leaders that are really have our best interest at heart and have actively shown that and aren't just showing up, you know, conveniently when the time is here.
[02:10:22.616 --> 02:10:33.770]   Now, we need people that we actually know the history on and trust and just I hope that there's some sort of blessing that happens, because I don't know.
[02:10:33.970 --> 02:10:37.931]  I'm very skeptical of the system now.
[02:10:37.971 --> 02:10:42.293]  It's just hard to be hopeful that it will work out for us.
[02:10:42.813 --> 02:10:49.176]  Allison Steinberg, from your mouth to God's ears, I cannot disagree with one thing you've said today.
[02:10:49.236 --> 02:10:52.477]  Again, where's the best place for people to find what you're saying uncensored?
[02:10:54.815 --> 02:10:56.837]  Uncensored is hard because they keep shutting me down.
[02:10:56.897 --> 02:10:59.939]  But for now, Instagram, Alice in Wonderland forever.
[02:11:00.099 --> 02:11:03.142]  And that's the same handle on TikTok and Telegram as well.
[02:11:03.162 --> 02:11:06.865]  You can also find my on the street reporting at webersway.com.
[02:11:07.105 --> 02:11:07.785]  All right.
[02:11:07.845 --> 02:11:10.007]  Have a great Christmas and look forward to talking to you again soon.
[02:11:10.928 --> 02:11:11.748]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[02:11:11.788 --> 02:11:12.389]  Merry Christmas.
[02:11:12.669 --> 02:11:13.350]  Merry Christmas to you.
[02:11:13.370 --> 02:11:13.970]  We'll be right back.
[02:11:13.990 --> 02:11:14.370]  Stay with us.
[02:11:16.172 --> 02:11:17.853]  All right.
[02:11:17.873 --> 02:11:21.616]  We have a very special guest host about to take over here in five minutes.
[02:11:22.516 --> 02:11:22.997]  Kate Daly.
[02:11:24.841 --> 02:11:29.022]  Hey, Dr. Zelenko on, an amazing guest, and our last guest was incredible as well.
[02:11:30.242 --> 02:11:33.222]  You definitely don't want to miss what's coming up, though, but man, some of the news.
[02:11:34.063 --> 02:11:43.104]  Breaking on InfoWars.com, Pfizer buys pharmaceutical company that makes heart medication to solve the problem caused by mRNA vaccines.
[02:11:43.204 --> 02:11:43.464]  Wow.
[02:11:44.984 --> 02:11:48.845]  You cannot make this up, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:11:50.325 --> 02:11:53.966]  And some of the other headlines are on InfoWars.com as well.
[02:11:55.453 --> 02:11:57.054]  But it is just mind-blowing.
[02:11:57.114 --> 02:12:05.800]  Journalist covering Ghislaine trial has laptop stolen after Maxwell's sister snaps their photo.
[02:12:09.923 --> 02:12:17.248]  Australia's chief pharmacist says public needs to accept boosters and mask mandates for many years to come.
[02:12:19.530 --> 02:12:22.872]  I covered a fraction of the pile in front of me, but we did a good job overall.
[02:12:23.860 --> 02:12:29.164]  But man, it is just so much crazier than I can even say or even break down.
[02:12:29.484 --> 02:12:29.644]  Wow.
[02:12:29.664 --> 02:12:34.308]  So we're going to go to break here in about four minutes and Kate Daly's about to take over.
[02:12:34.328 --> 02:12:43.595]  And I just want to, as we near Christmas here, thank the crew for the great job they've done and thank all the viewers and listeners for keeping us on air.
[02:12:43.454 --> 02:12:49.454]   But I sit here and I read this news and I cover these facts and it's just hard for me to even believe.
[02:12:49.454 --> 02:12:53.454]   Even though I knew this was all coming, it's still so insane.
[02:12:53.988 --> 02:13:00.351]  It's really hard to come to grips with the fact that we really have a global government.
[02:13:00.732 --> 02:13:02.653]  They really are deploying depopulation.
[02:13:02.673 --> 02:13:06.315]  Because, I mean, 30 years ago, I was reading these documents.
[02:13:06.335 --> 02:13:07.455]  28 years ago, I got on air.
[02:13:09.156 --> 02:13:14.259]  And I thought, you know, they're talking about this, but they're not really going to do this.
[02:13:14.499 --> 02:13:15.720]  I mean, come on, they're not going to.
[02:13:16.140 --> 02:13:20.863]  Sure, they've done it as a micro test in some third world countries, but they don't have the will.
[02:13:22.478 --> 02:13:25.699]  To actually try this in the real world against the general population.
[02:13:26.559 --> 02:13:27.459]  And folks, they've done it.
[02:13:28.600 --> 02:13:43.344]  And it's been our unconsciousness and our acquiescence and our weakness, mine included, that has encouraged this type of attack on society and on humanity.
[02:13:45.541 --> 02:13:49.383]  So I've already gone after Trump becoming pro-injection and pushing.
[02:13:49.403 --> 02:13:50.303]  I'm going to move on from him.
[02:13:50.323 --> 02:13:52.544]  He really is hurting himself.
[02:13:52.604 --> 02:13:53.784]  I'm not going to try to get in the middle of that.
[02:13:54.385 --> 02:13:56.786]  But we know who the current president is, and that's Joe Biden.
[02:13:57.286 --> 02:13:58.947]  We know Democrats all over the U.S.
[02:13:58.987 --> 02:14:07.970]  are setting up vaccine checkpoints and trying to intimidate people into taking these GMO shots that are directly linked and mainline news to infertility.
[02:14:08.290 --> 02:14:14.373]  I mean, look, here's the Wall Street Journal yesterday, the dangerous push to give boosters to teens.
[02:14:17.017 --> 02:14:17.898]  Why would the corporate media do that?
[02:14:17.918 --> 02:14:18.579]  They're covering their ass.
[02:14:18.999 --> 02:14:23.504]  The risk of vaccination, COVID transmission is not low.
[02:14:25.025 --> 02:14:27.848]  Scientific American says no action, the vaccinator is spreading it worse than anybody.
[02:14:29.369 --> 02:14:31.231]  And it goes on and on and on.
[02:14:31.892 --> 02:14:43.836]   Then they're scared of Jesse Waters coming out and saying, We need to confront Fauci with the truth that he ran the Wuhan lab and they were involved in this.
[02:14:43.856 --> 02:14:44.957]  That's the kill shot!
[02:14:44.977 --> 02:14:47.660]  And they go, oh, you mean murder him as a distraction.
[02:14:47.900 --> 02:14:50.722]  No, no, he's the one giving us the kill shot.
[02:14:51.863 --> 02:14:53.685]  He's the one coming after everybody.
[02:14:54.526 --> 02:15:00.591]  He's the one bringing us the GMO injection that killed lab animals and the secret tests that have now come out.
[02:15:03.434 --> 02:15:09.696]   All right, the next 54 minutes We're going to have Kate Dowley take over, syndicated talk show host.
[02:15:09.716 --> 02:15:18.082]  Then Owen Schroer is going to be taking over here today as well in the start of his show.
[02:15:18.242 --> 02:15:23.406]  And again, 56 minutes from now, Allison Steinberg was amazing as well.
[02:15:24.567 --> 02:15:29.831]  And I just, again, want to thank the crew for the amazing job they've done in the last year here.
[02:15:30.511 --> 02:15:32.493]  And we're now 320 days out.
[02:15:32.873 --> 02:15:34.294]  Didn't even get to this stack I meant to.
[02:15:35.066 --> 02:15:37.148]  I'll have to shoot a special report for tomorrow or Saturday.
[02:15:37.888 --> 02:15:41.892]  But the whole martial law, CIA says martial law is inevitable.
[02:15:42.292 --> 02:15:44.133]  You mean you politically lost control.
[02:15:44.213 --> 02:15:46.335]  You mean the public has woken up to you.
[02:15:46.375 --> 02:15:48.517]  You mean the world knows what you're doing.
[02:15:48.837 --> 02:15:53.741]  And so now you want to start a fake civil war that you blame on the American people with provocateurs.
[02:15:53.821 --> 02:15:55.362]  We know what you're up to.
[02:15:56.123 --> 02:15:57.064]  And it's all coming out.
[02:15:57.748 --> 02:15:58.710]  All right, stay with us.
[02:15:58.750 --> 02:16:05.201]  We'll be right back in T-minus 60 seconds on this live Thursday, December 23rd broadcast.
[02:16:06.431 --> 02:16:07.431]  Hi, back here with you.
[02:16:07.451 --> 02:16:09.892]  I'm Kay Dally, your guest host for this hour.
[02:16:09.932 --> 02:16:10.772]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:16:10.832 --> 02:16:12.953]  I hope you have a really, really Merry Christmas.
[02:16:13.193 --> 02:16:15.313]  And of course, I hope all of you do too.
[02:16:15.934 --> 02:16:23.636]  In fact, you know, it's interesting when you're doing live radio every day, you come up on a crossroads when it comes to holidays a little bit.
[02:16:23.676 --> 02:16:24.476]  I have to be honest.
[02:16:24.976 --> 02:16:28.197]  It's a little tough because I have breaking news.
[02:16:28.277 --> 02:16:29.397]  I have tough news.
[02:16:29.497 --> 02:16:33.679]  I have news that hurts because I don't even want to hear it.
[02:16:33.779 --> 02:16:34.859]  I know you don't want to hear it.
[02:16:38.746 --> 02:16:39.987]  It's also our biggest blessing.
[02:16:41.427 --> 02:16:52.153]  But what's interesting about radio is that, and I think they have known this in history all along, is that you have to fill the coffers once in a while as well.
[02:16:52.854 --> 02:16:56.075]  And they had to do that during the Revolutionary War.
[02:16:56.296 --> 02:16:59.597]  They had to do it during, well, you can go back to any century in history.
[02:17:00.718 --> 02:17:06.381]  So I was at a crossroads a little bit this week with what message do you share?
[02:17:07.261 --> 02:17:08.162]  What message do you give?
[02:17:09.588 --> 02:17:14.952]  And I think right now with the tough news cycle that is going on right now, and it is tough.
[02:17:15.352 --> 02:17:17.734]  I mean, I was just listening to Alex and it is.
[02:17:17.854 --> 02:17:18.574]  I agree with him.
[02:17:18.835 --> 02:17:22.577]  It's really, really hard right now because the news is shocking.
[02:17:23.418 --> 02:17:28.982]  You know, it used to be the battle between the Dems and the Repubs and not anymore.
[02:17:29.302 --> 02:17:29.762]  Not anymore.
[02:17:30.623 --> 02:17:34.045]  It's what shocking thing are they going to try to lie to us about?
[02:17:34.245 --> 02:17:34.766]  Claim?
[02:17:35.406 --> 02:17:36.327]  What are they going to do next?
[02:17:37.867 --> 02:17:41.029]  And so, I hope today's message inspires you.
[02:17:41.749 --> 02:17:45.552]  Inspires you to fight a little harder, do a little more, speak a little more truth.
[02:17:45.672 --> 02:17:51.055]  Every time I see the meme, peace on earth, I see it fly on my Facebook page.
[02:17:51.075 --> 02:17:52.836]  You know, I'm in Facebook jail, of course, right now.
[02:17:53.196 --> 02:17:57.039]  But I see it fly on my Facebook page all the time and, you know, peace on earth.
[02:17:57.079 --> 02:17:58.260]  I just want peace on earth.
[02:17:58.840 --> 02:17:59.640]  You know what I want?
[02:17:59.741 --> 02:18:00.901]  I want truth on earth.
[02:18:01.762 --> 02:18:02.402]  That's what I want.
[02:18:03.243 --> 02:18:03.763]  Just truth.
[02:18:04.563 --> 02:18:05.444]  Truth brings peace.
[02:18:05.644 --> 02:18:06.925]  I think we're asking for the wrong thing.
[02:18:08.325 --> 02:18:18.870]  And I think right now, as we all celebrate Christmas in just a few days, I think one of the questions that people will be asking in kind of the back of their mind, does God really care about us?
[02:18:19.351 --> 02:18:20.671]  Does he really care about freedom?
[02:18:20.691 --> 02:18:23.313]  It's a tough news cycle.
[02:18:24.213 --> 02:18:26.814]  It's hard to believe sometimes he's still there, right?
[02:18:28.835 --> 02:18:33.958]  And it seems as though the deep state has every single advantage, all the time.
[02:18:34.502 --> 02:18:38.084]  They have the media, they have Hollyweird, they have all those sickos.
[02:18:38.345 --> 02:18:39.065]  They have everybody.
[02:18:39.565 --> 02:18:40.366]  They have everybody.
[02:18:40.386 --> 02:18:46.550]  It's hard to know exactly where the good is happening, but it is.
[02:18:47.291 --> 02:18:47.551]  It is.
[02:18:47.611 --> 02:18:50.093]  And I want to share some of that with you today, hopefully.
[02:18:51.073 --> 02:18:54.496]  As we celebrate these holidays, some of you might have a little heaviness of heart.
[02:18:55.216 --> 02:18:55.937]  Let's fix that.
[02:18:56.677 --> 02:18:59.439]  I might have some messages that might make you change your perspective today.
[02:19:00.655 --> 02:19:05.918]  My friend Glenn Rossen reminded me of this wonderful story that has everything to do with where we find ourselves right now.
[02:19:07.199 --> 02:19:23.449]  And if I could go back to any place in history, and I mean any century, really any century, any place, any people, I don't care if they're brown or green or I don't care what they look like, I don't care who they are, I don't care what religion they are, we've always had the oppressed by government.
[02:19:24.229 --> 02:19:24.610]  Always.
[02:19:25.910 --> 02:19:28.592]  The citizens of Rome, they had Spartacus.
[02:19:29.132 --> 02:19:30.013]  Moses had God.
[02:19:30.953 --> 02:19:33.736]  Do you remember when Mary and Joseph were going to go pay their taxes?
[02:19:34.396 --> 02:19:36.318]  And they had to travel so far.
[02:19:37.379 --> 02:19:46.107]  And honestly, as pregnant as she could be, they still had to go try to pay their taxes for fear that the government was going to come down on them.
[02:19:46.948 --> 02:19:51.292]  And they were doing it at a time in Bethlehem when people gathered to do this.
[02:19:52.153 --> 02:20:02.638]   And what's interesting about that is that as they gathered to do this, There were a lot of thieves and robbers around and a lot of people around that could have done a lot of harm to them.
[02:20:03.478 --> 02:20:09.522]  But they knew they had to because the government was so oppressive at the time that they had to take the journey.
[02:20:10.003 --> 02:20:10.683]  They had to.
[02:20:10.943 --> 02:20:13.245]  And they had to risk her going into labor.
[02:20:13.305 --> 02:20:14.926]  They had to risk the baby.
[02:20:14.966 --> 02:20:22.211]  They had to risk everything to go pay their their little cents at the at the at the taxation store, if you will.
[02:20:23.632 --> 02:20:26.114]  Mary and Joseph were not good global citizens.
[02:20:26.674 --> 02:20:27.275]  I'll tell you that.
[02:20:28.843 --> 02:20:33.047]  The Christ child would have never made it, had Mary and Joseph been a good global citizen.
[02:20:33.507 --> 02:20:36.370]  A good citizen that was told to obey its government at every step.
[02:20:37.131 --> 02:20:38.412]  It just wouldn't have happened.
[02:20:39.313 --> 02:20:40.234]  They would have offered him up.
[02:20:41.755 --> 02:20:42.856]  What did the government decree?
[02:20:42.876 --> 02:20:47.341]  That under the age of two, you would be dead, right?
[02:20:47.601 --> 02:20:48.121]  You would die.
[02:20:49.362 --> 02:20:52.966]  There were some good global citizens, but Mary and Joseph were not among them.
[02:20:53.567 --> 02:20:54.748]  What does that tell us about today?
[02:20:54.768 --> 02:20:56.029]  It tells me a lot.
[02:20:56.409 --> 02:21:01.833]  It tells me to fight a very oppressive government and consistently resist, as they've done in the past.
[02:21:02.754 --> 02:21:04.275]  Mary and Joseph did, for Pete's sakes.
[02:21:05.716 --> 02:21:08.558]  We had, in our time, George Washington and Thomas Paine.
[02:21:09.759 --> 02:21:11.281]  And why do I mention Thomas Paine?
[02:21:13.702 --> 02:21:25.650]   Well, as the troops were positioned on the Delaware, across from General Howe's mercenaries, The army was reduced from 20,000 soldiers, George Washington's army, to about 6,000 soldiers.
[02:21:25.710 --> 02:21:26.730]  Not a very big presence.
[02:21:26.950 --> 02:21:30.572]  They were up against the largest army in the world.
[02:21:30.812 --> 02:21:31.412]  Think about that.
[02:21:31.833 --> 02:21:32.793]  What would that look like now?
[02:21:33.133 --> 02:21:34.254]  Would we feel pretty defeated?
[02:21:34.294 --> 02:21:34.674]  Of course.
[02:21:35.394 --> 02:21:36.675]  There was no winter clothing.
[02:21:37.335 --> 02:21:38.296]  They were starving.
[02:21:38.556 --> 02:21:40.377]  They were reduced to eating tree bark.
[02:21:41.057 --> 02:21:44.499]  Bitter cold, as you can imagine, as it is right now.
[02:21:46.662 --> 02:21:52.747]  6,000 men probably wondered what they were even fighting for because liberty had never really been achieved in the way that we were about to do it.
[02:21:52.967 --> 02:21:53.728]  It was just an idea.
[02:21:54.408 --> 02:21:55.770]  It wasn't even substantiated.
[02:21:55.950 --> 02:22:00.754]  They didn't really have a big taste of what that would look like or feel like at the time.
[02:22:02.175 --> 02:22:05.138]  There were not enough guns, not enough ammunition, not enough food.
[02:22:07.079 --> 02:22:16.305]  But there was this incredible idea that we could change history by owning our own government, a very limited government, and that we could actually have our liberty back.
[02:22:16.365 --> 02:22:19.226]  We could actually attain full liberty status.
[02:22:19.947 --> 02:22:20.687]  Very exciting.
[02:22:21.688 --> 02:22:38.328]   But to the soldiers sitting there starving, and I mean emaciated, with clothes that were barely tatters, barefoot, many of them, it was probably I can imagine that.
[02:22:39.128 --> 02:22:39.849]  Very, very hard.
[02:22:40.589 --> 02:22:42.749]  We weren't even fully America at this point.
[02:22:43.290 --> 02:22:45.770]  But Thomas Paine walked in, started talking to the troops.
[02:22:46.810 --> 02:22:49.491]  And he penned what some said, the American crisis.
[02:22:49.531 --> 02:22:50.792]  And this was in the month of December, 1776.
[02:22:51.052 --> 02:22:53.732]  The American crisis.
[02:22:53.772 --> 02:22:54.813]  Think about what we're in right now.
[02:22:58.914 --> 02:23:01.494]  His words were very compelling.
[02:23:03.115 --> 02:23:03.915]  This is what he said.
[02:23:04.415 --> 02:23:06.996]  And he was said to write it on the head of a drum.
[02:23:07.952 --> 02:23:08.372]  At the time.
[02:23:09.152 --> 02:23:10.833]  Remember, everything was scarce.
[02:23:11.953 --> 02:23:14.434]  He said, these are the times that try men's souls.
[02:23:15.134 --> 02:23:22.216]  The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country.
[02:23:23.457 --> 02:23:24.897]  But he stands it now.
[02:23:25.537 --> 02:23:29.779]  But he that stands it now deserves the love and thanks of every man and woman.
[02:23:30.619 --> 02:23:33.660]  Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered.
[02:23:34.758 --> 02:23:39.240]  Yet we have this consolation within us that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.
[02:23:40.080 --> 02:23:44.181]  What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly.
[02:23:45.202 --> 02:23:48.022]  It is dearness only that gives everything its value.
[02:23:49.163 --> 02:23:51.944]  Heaven knows how to put a proper price upon its goods.
[02:23:53.284 --> 02:23:58.386]  And it would be strange indeed if so celestial an article as freedom should not be highly rated.
[02:23:59.116 --> 02:24:07.184]  Britain, with an army to enforce her tyranny, has declared that she has a right, not only to tax, but to bind us in all cases whatsoever.
[02:24:07.645 --> 02:24:08.606]  Isn't that what we're looking at now?
[02:24:10.368 --> 02:24:16.114]  And if being bound by that manner is not slavery, then there is not such a thing as slavery upon earth.
[02:24:17.055 --> 02:24:21.299]  Even the expression, for so unlimited a power can only belong to God.
[02:24:22.816 --> 02:24:26.037]  He wrote those words and it uplifted George Washington and the troops.
[02:24:26.537 --> 02:24:33.418]  So much so, because remember, their, um, their stay in the army was about to expire December 31st.
[02:24:34.598 --> 02:24:39.059]  The British weren't going after them because they knew that they were going to expire and take off anyway.
[02:24:39.979 --> 02:24:40.759]  They were starving.
[02:24:41.019 --> 02:24:41.819]  They had nothing.
[02:24:42.980 --> 02:24:43.820]  They were suffering.
[02:24:44.820 --> 02:24:45.820]  They knew they wouldn't last.
[02:24:47.740 --> 02:24:50.781]  So at that time, they sort of waded them out on the other side of the river.
[02:24:51.869 --> 02:24:54.710]  Well, Christmas Day, George Washington forged ahead.
[02:24:56.071 --> 02:25:00.373]  And we all know the outcome of that battle because it was pivotal to what became of America.
[02:25:00.873 --> 02:25:12.118]  But my interest in that was, how do you get a group of people so defeated, so utterly defeated, that they would again stand up to fight for only an idea?
[02:25:12.138 --> 02:25:13.559]  I mean, we've had a taste of it.
[02:25:13.779 --> 02:25:15.020]  We know what liberty is.
[02:25:16.400 --> 02:25:17.761]  But to them, it was just this idea.
[02:25:19.124 --> 02:25:24.088]  But there again, those words gave them the hope to keep fighting and more joined.
[02:25:25.229 --> 02:25:26.129]  And that was the secret.
[02:25:26.690 --> 02:25:27.390]  It was in numbers.
[02:25:28.511 --> 02:25:29.092]  It was in numbers.
[02:25:30.373 --> 02:25:31.193]  They won that battle.
[02:25:31.253 --> 02:25:32.855]  It was a turning point of the revolution.
[02:25:32.975 --> 02:25:36.457]  One of the several turning points that gave us our freedom today.
[02:25:37.538 --> 02:25:40.180]  I'll be right back because I want to describe you in this fight.
[02:25:41.201 --> 02:25:42.622]  I want to describe me in this fight.
[02:25:43.663 --> 02:25:46.225]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host from The Kate Dally Show.
[02:25:47.216 --> 02:25:48.977]  You can go to katedallyradio.com.
[02:25:50.197 --> 02:25:50.758]  I'll be right back.
[02:25:52.018 --> 02:25:57.141]  Kate Dally here for Alex Jones and so happy to be here, especially two days before Christmas.
[02:25:57.421 --> 02:25:58.922]  What a wonderful time to be on the show.
[02:25:59.462 --> 02:26:10.207]  I'm actually really happy about that because you have to fill the coffers of hope as much as you talk about the things that are pretty terrifying that are happening right now.
[02:26:11.072 --> 02:26:23.439]  And I think what's amazing, I think especially because Alex has done so much work in enlightening people, I do want to talk about one of our greatest blessings and that is that we're awake.
[02:26:24.040 --> 02:26:24.460]  We see it.
[02:26:24.480 --> 02:26:28.042]  Man, can you imagine being somebody that doesn't see it?
[02:26:28.623 --> 02:26:31.044]  Can you imagine being that guy?
[02:26:31.744 --> 02:26:35.767]  Anyway, so I was talking about George Washington.
[02:26:36.414 --> 02:26:39.356]  And I was really thinking a lot about that time period.
[02:26:39.436 --> 02:26:53.827]  You know, it's always nice to hear a story from the past and you try to put yourself in their shoes and it's sometimes it can be difficult because we think of them as a different people at such a different time and that, oh, they're not us and they're not going through what we're going through.
[02:26:54.668 --> 02:26:57.450]  But you know, they really were just in a different way.
[02:26:58.490 --> 02:26:59.151]  Same battle.
[02:27:00.572 --> 02:27:04.035]  Had it not been for that moment, America would have succumbed.
[02:27:04.215 --> 02:27:15.266]   Had it not been for those words, That I think were pretty divinely appointed at the time to Thomas Paine, who really uplifted the troops at the time and reminded them about how precious liberty is.
[02:27:15.786 --> 02:27:23.408]  About what they were fighting for was so amazing that they had to keep going even though they were completely suffering at the time.
[02:27:25.689 --> 02:27:37.693]   And his divine, you know, words of encouragement and focus Really sort of impressed upon the troops that they had to keep going, that it was really going to be worth it.
[02:27:38.073 --> 02:27:39.233]  It was really going to be worth it.
[02:27:40.714 --> 02:27:50.377]  And even at our lowest points in history, no matter what century you pick, no matter what people were talking about, there's always been God provided miracles.
[02:27:50.737 --> 02:27:51.177]  Hasn't there?
[02:27:51.477 --> 02:27:52.458]  At every single turn.
[02:27:54.578 --> 02:27:56.939]  Look at, uh, look at Rome.
[02:27:57.539 --> 02:27:58.440]  They had Spartacus.
[02:27:58.660 --> 02:28:02.221]  There was always somebody put in the path to help out.
[02:28:02.947 --> 02:28:03.548]  To inspire.
[02:28:03.568 --> 02:28:05.469]  To encourage the troops.
[02:28:05.950 --> 02:28:06.751]  To get them gathered.
[02:28:07.251 --> 02:28:10.714]  And to get them to do... the impossible, really.
[02:28:11.615 --> 02:28:11.876]  Right?
[02:28:12.636 --> 02:28:15.939]  Always provided the miracle of the right person at the right time to lift us up.
[02:28:17.100 --> 02:28:18.702]  In other words, think of it this way.
[02:28:19.443 --> 02:28:20.304]  They've never won.
[02:28:20.324 --> 02:28:24.528]  The Deep State has never really won.
[02:28:25.349 --> 02:28:29.987]   Because had they got their way, my gosh, we would have been done for a long time ago.
[02:28:29.987 --> 02:28:33.268]  They've never been able to beat God.
[02:28:33.427 --> 02:28:34.908]  Isn't that interesting?
[02:28:36.649 --> 02:28:46.497]  In America, when they had their way with central banking and the UN, the introduction of the UN in just about a 30 year time span, pretty quick, right?
[02:28:46.677 --> 02:28:47.438]  And the CIA.
[02:28:49.059 --> 02:28:52.181]  They would have shut this country down quickly, wouldn't they have?
[02:28:53.042 --> 02:28:53.702]  If they could have.
[02:28:54.603 --> 02:28:58.566]  Look how many years it's taken for them to do damage.
[02:28:59.727 --> 02:29:01.943]   And that's only because We've been asleep.
[02:29:02.624 --> 02:29:03.864]  We've been trying to raise families.
[02:29:04.184 --> 02:29:07.085]  We've been trying to do those things that keep us very, very busy.
[02:29:07.526 --> 02:29:07.926]  I'm sure.
[02:29:07.946 --> 02:29:19.070]  But isn't it amazing that when you look back on that battle of George Washington, a very pivotal point in America succeeding, isn't it amazing that it was done on Christmas Day?
[02:29:21.672 --> 02:29:23.452]  Freedom from chains.
[02:29:24.933 --> 02:29:25.633]  In both cases.
[02:29:26.834 --> 02:29:27.434]  Birth of Christ.
[02:29:29.764 --> 02:29:33.685]  And really the birth of this country, because it was really the mindset.
[02:29:34.186 --> 02:29:36.226]  The country could never be just a piece of property.
[02:29:37.027 --> 02:29:37.847]  Land is land.
[02:29:38.567 --> 02:29:48.051]  It's the people and their perspective, what they fight for, what they're about, their character level, their values, what they represent that makes a country, right?
[02:29:48.811 --> 02:29:51.932]  And this country is filled with people who could see what was going on.
[02:29:52.352 --> 02:29:56.594]  We were never so oppressed that we couldn't fight.
[02:29:57.486 --> 02:29:59.187]  For our lives, that we couldn't fight for our country.
[02:29:59.547 --> 02:30:02.549]  We were never so oppressed, right?
[02:30:03.230 --> 02:30:07.593]  We weren't in the state of what some Romans were at the time, right?
[02:30:07.813 --> 02:30:09.234]  We were looking ahead.
[02:30:09.794 --> 02:30:17.800]  Americans have always had a gift that they could look ahead and see what was coming and see how government was going to handle things.
[02:30:18.800 --> 02:30:19.921]  And we knew that we didn't want it.
[02:30:20.441 --> 02:30:27.941]   We knew that if the British were kept in charge, that we would continue to get more and more oppression.
[02:30:27.941 --> 02:30:28.941]  We knew that.
[02:30:28.941 --> 02:30:31.941]  What a gift that is.
[02:30:31.941 --> 02:30:41.941]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:30:33.045 --> 02:30:40.450]  And what a gift it was that we were able to fight just at the idea of what the government was going to do.
[02:30:40.470 --> 02:30:52.018]  That we, good men and women, mostly men, were able to suffer, were able to get through what they got through for this country.
[02:30:52.358 --> 02:30:53.219]  That's pretty amazing.
[02:30:54.279 --> 02:30:58.122]   When it comes to evidence of God, I think there's plenty of it.
[02:30:58.402 --> 02:30:59.323]  Go back in the centuries.
[02:30:59.863 --> 02:31:02.544]  No wonder the world celebrates Christmas.
[02:31:03.024 --> 02:31:05.024]  No wonder they celebrate the birth of Christ.
[02:31:05.884 --> 02:31:07.705]  It's been illegal during the centuries.
[02:31:08.525 --> 02:31:11.046]  It's been absolutely illegal to celebrate.
[02:31:12.766 --> 02:31:22.189]  But since we formed America, religious freedom, it was that important to be able to do and worship in the way that we wanted to have the freedom to do that.
[02:31:24.116 --> 02:31:35.043]  But isn't it interesting that only Christmas Day can bring kindness, can bring love, can bring the Christmas miracles, can bring all of the things that only Christmas can do.
[02:31:35.643 --> 02:31:37.024]  No other birth could do that.
[02:31:37.564 --> 02:31:38.285]  It's pretty amazing.
[02:31:40.646 --> 02:31:46.110]  You know, looking at forced inoculations right now, we look at the loss of body autonomy.
[02:31:47.150 --> 02:31:51.513]  And quite simply, right now, I think we've already lost body autonomy.
[02:31:54.309 --> 02:31:56.090]  Very difficult to get them to listen to you.
[02:31:56.170 --> 02:31:57.411]  Medical tyranny at its best.
[02:31:57.551 --> 02:31:58.252]  I know, I lived it.
[02:31:58.992 --> 02:31:59.533]  With my husband.
[02:32:01.014 --> 02:32:02.075]  And that was tough to see.
[02:32:03.556 --> 02:32:04.677]  We can still fight against it.
[02:32:05.017 --> 02:32:06.898]  We can still provide the resistance against it.
[02:32:07.238 --> 02:32:07.979]  And we're going to.
[02:32:09.320 --> 02:32:13.183]  But isn't it interesting how much we've lost that we need to regain.
[02:32:13.623 --> 02:32:14.904]  That means we need to wake up quickly.
[02:32:15.244 --> 02:32:17.506]  And that means we also need to wake others up too.
[02:32:18.246 --> 02:32:32.432]   Because in the event of that event that happened with George Washington, What's really interesting about that is that the government basically at that time could have taken us out and they didn't.
[02:32:33.012 --> 02:32:33.252]  Right?
[02:32:34.092 --> 02:32:34.472]  They didn't.
[02:32:36.513 --> 02:32:37.713]  And that was a miracle.
[02:32:38.234 --> 02:32:39.474]  It was a miracle that we fought.
[02:32:39.714 --> 02:32:41.075]  It was a miracle that we resisted.
[02:32:41.155 --> 02:32:42.635]  It was a miracle that we got America.
[02:32:42.695 --> 02:32:44.256]  But the Constitution is still in place.
[02:32:44.956 --> 02:32:47.897]  The one that was formed through the blood of that event.
[02:32:49.138 --> 02:32:53.425]   If the Constitution is still there, That means we can utilize it.
[02:32:54.226 --> 02:32:55.987]  And last I checked, it was still there.
[02:32:57.187 --> 02:33:00.409]  And what's also interesting about this is your role in this.
[02:33:01.970 --> 02:33:04.052]  You know, for some reason you're here right now.
[02:33:05.673 --> 02:33:07.354]  We can look back at the founding fathers.
[02:33:07.394 --> 02:33:08.915]  We can look back at David and Goliath.
[02:33:08.935 --> 02:33:10.476]  We can look back at Moses.
[02:33:10.516 --> 02:33:18.160]  We can look back at all the times in history when different people appeared to be able to perform a miracle of their time.
[02:33:20.162 --> 02:33:20.762]  But you know what?
[02:33:21.573 --> 02:33:23.675]  We are, too, the miracle of this time.
[02:33:24.735 --> 02:33:25.976]  And we're used and utilized.
[02:33:27.037 --> 02:33:28.558]  And I think that's really important to know.
[02:33:28.899 --> 02:33:33.642]  And those of you that get down around Christmas time, for some time, you know, some people it's a sad time.
[02:33:33.702 --> 02:33:34.223]  It's a hard time.
[02:33:35.203 --> 02:33:35.884]  They get depressed.
[02:33:36.124 --> 02:33:36.744]  I understand it.
[02:33:36.925 --> 02:33:37.625]  I've been there before.
[02:33:39.747 --> 02:33:54.721]   But you must have had enough confidence in you, and in me, and in all the people that understand what's going on, That he has enough confidence in us right now at this time to help out and do our part.
[02:33:55.842 --> 02:33:58.244]  That's a pretty phenomenal idea, isn't it?
[02:33:59.745 --> 02:34:01.387]  That he has confidence in us.
[02:34:02.668 --> 02:34:03.969]  We're supposed to be here right now.
[02:34:05.009 --> 02:34:05.790]  This is our time.
[02:34:07.491 --> 02:34:09.933]  And if you're alive and on this earth, you're here for a reason.
[02:34:10.854 --> 02:34:12.535]  And there's no reason to get down on the holidays.
[02:34:14.477 --> 02:34:21.535]   Because you're being counted on right now to do the impossible and to have faith in miracles And to restore the country.
[02:34:22.015 --> 02:34:22.856]  It's you and me, kid.
[02:34:24.516 --> 02:34:25.156]  I'll be right back.
[02:34:25.236 --> 02:34:25.777]  Kate Dally.
[02:34:26.457 --> 02:34:27.577]  I have so much more to say.
[02:34:27.637 --> 02:34:28.077]  Stay with me.
[02:34:29.098 --> 02:34:30.118]  Kate Dally for Alex Jones.
[02:34:30.158 --> 02:34:30.498]  Thank you.
[02:34:30.938 --> 02:34:31.418]  Be right back.
[02:34:32.679 --> 02:34:35.320]  Kate Dally back here with you from the Kate Dally Show.
[02:34:35.400 --> 02:34:36.820]  KateDallyRadio.com.
[02:34:36.940 --> 02:34:39.261]  I hope you have a amazing Christmas.
[02:34:39.401 --> 02:34:40.021]  I really do.
[02:34:40.041 --> 02:34:44.943]  I hope you celebrate it with just about everything in your heart and all the passion that you can muster.
[02:34:44.963 --> 02:34:45.503]  Because you know what?
[02:34:48.353 --> 02:34:53.616]  Cultural left, those lefties, those asinine jokes of people, they hate it.
[02:34:54.157 --> 02:34:55.557]  They hate Christmas.
[02:34:56.938 --> 02:34:58.519]  They hate that we believe in God.
[02:34:58.559 --> 02:34:59.160]  They hate it.
[02:34:59.380 --> 02:34:59.900]  They hate it.
[02:35:00.100 --> 02:35:00.681]  And you know what?
[02:35:00.701 --> 02:35:01.621]  It's okay.
[02:35:02.482 --> 02:35:02.902]  It's okay.
[02:35:02.922 --> 02:35:03.682]  Have passion in it.
[02:35:04.243 --> 02:35:04.723]  Do it right.
[02:35:04.743 --> 02:35:06.564]  You know, I was looking back.
[02:35:07.465 --> 02:35:10.807]  I just hit my 10 year anniversary mark, you know, for being in radio.
[02:35:11.307 --> 02:35:15.850]  And I was looking back at all these, these things, even in just this year that we've talked about.
[02:35:16.581 --> 02:35:25.084]  And it's so amazing to me because even since the inception of the country, they knew that they could not go up against our liberty as people fully.
[02:35:25.104 --> 02:35:25.785]  Okay?
[02:35:25.925 --> 02:35:28.886]  They nick at it, they try, they do everything they can do.
[02:35:29.346 --> 02:35:33.628]  They even tried to pass, you know, Encouraging Vaccines Act, right?
[02:35:34.248 --> 02:35:39.130]  And I did a show right here on Alex Jones about the whole pharma, and I know he's done many shows on pharma.
[02:35:39.950 --> 02:35:41.231]  And so we know the game, right?
[02:35:41.935 --> 02:35:45.695]   But isn't it amazing that they never really could fully pass it, even when they refer to
[02:35:45.695 --> 02:35:49.536]   Jacobson versus Massachusetts. I've mentioned this a few times when I've guest hosted.
[02:35:49.536 --> 02:35:57.694]   And even that, they had to offer a $5 or the vaccine. They could never fully
[02:35:57.694 --> 02:36:03.935]   get rid of your liberty. Think about that. They were never able to fully do it.
[02:36:03.935 --> 02:36:07.855]   Even though now the media looks back and says, "Oh yeah, the Supreme Court, oh yeah,
[02:36:08.415 --> 02:36:13.295]   they were all in on inoculations and people had to have them." No, they didn't.
[02:36:13.295 --> 02:36:17.855]   Jacobson versus Massachusetts, Jacobson never had to have the shot. He had to pay the five bucks.
[02:36:17.855 --> 02:36:21.456]  That's what the case was about. But you're not told that.
[02:36:21.456 --> 02:36:24.495]  Okay? We know the media lies.
[02:36:24.495 --> 02:36:27.055]  They're a bunch of whores. They totally lie all the time.
[02:36:27.055 --> 02:36:29.935]  And so why would you believe them now?
[02:36:29.935 --> 02:36:36.625]  Right? Well, they never could fully do it. King fraud a lot.
[02:36:02.816 --> 02:36:07.454]   fully do it. Even though now the media looks back and says, "Oh yeah, the Supreme Court,
[02:36:07.454 --> 02:36:13.296]   oh yeah, they were all in on inoculations and people had to have them." No, they didn't.
[02:36:13.296 --> 02:36:17.856]   Jacobson versus Massachusetts, Jacobson never had to have the shot. He had to pay the five bucks.
[02:36:17.856 --> 02:36:21.456]  That's what the case was about. But you're not told that.
[02:36:21.456 --> 02:36:24.495]  Okay? We know the media lies.
[02:36:24.495 --> 02:36:27.056]  They're a bunch of whores. They totally lie all the time.
[02:36:27.056 --> 02:36:29.936]  And so why would you believe them now?
[02:36:29.936 --> 02:36:36.325]  Right? Well, they never could fully do it. King fraud a lot.
[02:36:36.325 --> 02:36:43.195]   And little Hormala, who stole the election, couldn't pass off his ridiculous
[02:36:43.195 --> 02:36:45.215]  press conference as a law.
[02:36:45.215 --> 02:36:51.936]   And they had to back down, didn't they? They had to. His press conference was never a decree,
[02:36:51.936 --> 02:36:56.816]   a law, we don't have a king, a mandate, nothing. It was smoke and mirrors.
[02:36:57.534 --> 02:37:03.215]   OSHA, who has no real authority to exist, right? Could not get a court to hardly
[02:37:03.215 --> 02:37:08.255]  side with them ever in their history. Had to back down too.
[02:37:08.255 --> 02:37:12.175]  We're starting to see the smoke and mirrors.
[02:37:12.327 --> 02:37:14.428]  The American people are forming an underground.
[02:37:14.989 --> 02:37:15.869]  It's kind of amazing.
[02:37:16.950 --> 02:37:28.197]  Doctors now, the unvaxxed with the unvaxxed patients out there that need care, are now starting to look for funding so they can get away from the system and create their own underground system.
[02:37:28.597 --> 02:37:29.638]  Underground above ground.
[02:37:30.279 --> 02:37:30.739]  I love that.
[02:37:30.998 --> 02:37:36.199]   Pilots are doing the same thing. I want to catch a flight You know chipping a few bucks for gas, you know that kind
[02:37:36.199 --> 02:37:39.438]   of thing Which is illegal
[02:37:38.687 --> 02:37:40.548]  I would never do that in a million years.
[02:37:41.449 --> 02:37:42.390]  But you know what?
[02:37:42.450 --> 02:37:44.491]  You're starting to see the underground develop.
[02:37:44.511 --> 02:37:47.554]  You're starting to see people go, I don't have to be part of this system anymore.
[02:37:49.115 --> 02:38:00.284]  When we saw over 110 pilot deaths due to mostly the shot and six deaths the year before in their own pilot magazine, there's a problem, right?
[02:38:01.164 --> 02:38:01.605]  We know it.
[02:38:01.865 --> 02:38:02.986]  They can't hide it anymore.
[02:38:03.547 --> 02:38:04.348]  That's the problem.
[02:38:04.948 --> 02:38:12.795]  Triple vaccinated are four more times as likely to get to test positive for the moronic variant than the unvaccinated.
[02:38:14.376 --> 02:38:14.817]  Okay.
[02:38:16.278 --> 02:38:18.920]  The unjabbed know more about the shot than the jabbed.
[02:38:19.401 --> 02:38:19.741]  Duh.
[02:38:21.622 --> 02:38:24.485]  I've never met anybody that believed in the jab that knew anything about it.
[02:38:25.286 --> 02:38:27.007]  Can you imagine being one of those guys?
[02:38:27.848 --> 02:38:27.908]  Ew.
[02:38:30.123 --> 02:38:33.525]  Pfizer knew the jab would give off spike proteins to the unjabbed.
[02:38:33.565 --> 02:38:35.146]  They called it occupational exposure.
[02:38:35.786 --> 02:38:36.927]  In their own paperwork.
[02:38:37.267 --> 02:38:38.247]  All of this is documented.
[02:38:40.329 --> 02:38:43.150]  The study that came out about the unjabbed knowing more than the jabbed?
[02:38:44.071 --> 02:38:45.251]  I mean, really?
[02:38:45.271 --> 02:38:48.413]  Did they really need to even come out with a study?
[02:38:50.294 --> 02:38:50.954]  Give me a break.
[02:38:52.575 --> 02:38:54.616]  All of their lies are coming to the forefront.
[02:38:54.816 --> 02:38:56.237]  You don't even have to guess anymore.
[02:38:57.038 --> 02:38:58.338]  The mountain of evidence we have?
[02:38:59.079 --> 02:38:59.459]  This high.
[02:39:01.052 --> 02:39:02.252]  The mountain of evidence they have?
[02:39:02.752 --> 02:39:03.673]  The media telling you.
[02:39:04.893 --> 02:39:11.694]  With their shiny faces and their fake teeth and their fake hair and showing you that they know what's up.
[02:39:12.434 --> 02:39:12.914]  No they don't.
[02:39:13.335 --> 02:39:15.995]  They don't have any evidence except their TV expert doctor.
[02:39:17.375 --> 02:39:20.096]  So, we actually have it a little easier than you think we do.
[02:39:20.336 --> 02:39:21.836]  Because the lies are so apparent.
[02:39:21.996 --> 02:39:25.797]  People are prepping, they're growing their own food, they're leaving their jobs, they're resisting.
[02:39:26.277 --> 02:39:27.558]  Pockets are resisting.
[02:39:29.438 --> 02:39:29.638]  Right?
[02:39:32.096 --> 02:39:37.920]  You know what's interesting, too, is Alex Newman, my guest this last week, had an interesting point on the show.
[02:39:37.940 --> 02:39:45.384]  He said, you know, he said, after almost two years, nobody is going to the side of Fauci and Biden, King fraud a lot.
[02:39:46.045 --> 02:39:49.107]  Nobody is going to little Hitler man and King fraud a lot.
[02:39:50.427 --> 02:39:50.768]  No one.
[02:39:51.448 --> 02:39:52.849]  They're not gaining any support.
[02:39:54.310 --> 02:40:01.014]  They're losing people to support of the other side, which means that their case is falling short.
[02:40:01.854 --> 02:40:03.755]  They got a little too desperate, didn't they?
[02:40:04.695 --> 02:40:05.655]  A little too desperate.
[02:40:06.916 --> 02:40:07.956]  And so it's falling apart.
[02:40:07.996 --> 02:40:09.156]  It's getting easier to see.
[02:40:09.677 --> 02:40:15.578]  You're seeing more and more people that have a lot more logic and a lot more common sense that are going, now wait a minute here.
[02:40:16.199 --> 02:40:18.099]  How can we have four variants?
[02:40:18.419 --> 02:40:21.740]  I take a shot and it doesn't work and I have to take four more shots.
[02:40:22.141 --> 02:40:23.961]  Something about that isn't set well with me.
[02:40:24.521 --> 02:40:24.601]  Hmm.
[02:40:24.841 --> 02:40:26.242]  Let me go get my common sense on.
[02:40:28.071 --> 02:40:33.474]  So I find it kind of interesting that at this time in history, they're losing their audience.
[02:40:34.415 --> 02:40:35.596]  Isn't that great though?
[02:40:35.736 --> 02:40:39.798]  Because three-fourths of the country knows they're a fraud.
[02:40:40.539 --> 02:40:43.120]  Three-fourths of the country knows the truth.
[02:40:44.761 --> 02:40:46.322]  Do you know how amazing that is?
[02:40:47.483 --> 02:40:49.584]  The Revolutionary Times didn't have that advantage.
[02:40:50.565 --> 02:40:54.487]  They didn't have the advantage of three-fourths of the country understanding what was going on.
[02:40:56.056 --> 02:40:58.618]  Our only problem is that we don't know how to get together to fight it.
[02:40:59.158 --> 02:40:59.899]  That's our problem.
[02:41:00.839 --> 02:41:02.420]  Our problem is we don't know how to join.
[02:41:02.921 --> 02:41:05.823]  We don't know how to, we don't know how to become that force.
[02:41:07.424 --> 02:41:08.484]  Is it a civil war?
[02:41:08.945 --> 02:41:11.686]  Is it using the Constitution in the courtroom?
[02:41:12.327 --> 02:41:14.308]  There are a lot of different ways to fight this.
[02:41:15.469 --> 02:41:19.892]  I think a lot of ways with humor that actually wake up people more so than anything else.
[02:41:20.432 --> 02:41:21.573]  And we'll talk about that for a second.
[02:41:23.063 --> 02:41:30.529]  But some of my most interesting guests in 10 years of radio have been the guests that escaped.
[02:41:31.010 --> 02:41:32.551]  Their country escaped.
[02:41:32.651 --> 02:41:37.375]  Their country was able to do the damage to the deep state and win.
[02:41:37.395 --> 02:41:40.378]  I will never forget having Harold Ziegler on.
[02:41:41.258 --> 02:41:42.640]  He escaped East Germany.
[02:41:43.660 --> 02:41:45.282]  And you know what the situation there was?
[02:41:45.862 --> 02:41:47.604]  They had very, very small groups.
[02:41:48.263 --> 02:42:00.416]  And inside those small groups, one person in that small group would know where another group, a very small group, was getting together in more closed door meetings, shall we say.
[02:42:01.478 --> 02:42:04.341]  And only that one person knew about this other group.
[02:42:04.621 --> 02:42:08.165]  And from that group, only one person knew about the other group, right?
[02:42:09.033 --> 02:42:18.261]  And all of those groups were able to communicate just having one person within their very small group be able to be the liaison to the other group so that they could communicate without getting caught.
[02:42:19.202 --> 02:42:24.787]  And what they did was they called for people to walk around the churches in mass.
[02:42:25.708 --> 02:42:36.177]  And people started going and they started a thousand and then it became five thousand and then it became ten thousand people walking around the churches and we're talking full oppression.
[02:42:37.290 --> 02:42:37.951]  Full oppression.
[02:42:37.991 --> 02:42:39.372]  You can't get more oppression than this.
[02:42:40.833 --> 02:42:47.098]  And as they walked around the church with the optics, they knew that they couldn't just start shooting people, right?
[02:42:47.138 --> 02:42:48.999]  They couldn't just go into violence.
[02:42:49.400 --> 02:42:51.702]  The people were walking around a church for Pete's sakes.
[02:42:53.563 --> 02:42:54.424]  And so what did they do?
[02:42:54.624 --> 02:42:56.425]  They just kept walking in mass.
[02:42:57.446 --> 02:42:59.228]  And finally, they had to roll over.
[02:42:59.948 --> 02:43:10.339]   They had to realize that there was enough people walking around those churches In protest that they were going to lose the battle.
[02:43:11.640 --> 02:43:19.547]  And I always find stories like that amazing because it took people with some ingenuity, but it also took a lot of people joining in.
[02:43:19.567 --> 02:43:22.310]  That's exactly what happened during that revolutionary battle.
[02:43:23.030 --> 02:43:24.812]  They were joined by people for help.
[02:43:25.513 --> 02:43:31.518]  People were inspired by their fight to go on the suffering and they decided to join them.
[02:43:32.697 --> 02:43:37.700]  And that's the only reason they became enough presence to ward off the British.
[02:43:39.320 --> 02:43:40.021]  Isn't that amazing?
[02:43:40.121 --> 02:43:42.042]  And then in East Germany, the same thing.
[02:43:43.483 --> 02:43:46.224]  Too many people protesting together.
[02:43:46.664 --> 02:43:48.845]  Too many people saying what they wanted to say.
[02:43:50.006 --> 02:43:53.728]  And really, without even words, made such an impact in the time.
[02:43:55.249 --> 02:44:04.489]   But it was because of that that we can learn what we need to be doing now, and there's I'm Kate Dally, your guest host in this hour.
[02:44:04.509 --> 02:44:08.171]  So grateful to Alex and his show for waking people up all around the world.
[02:44:08.891 --> 02:44:10.552]  It's truly amazing.
[02:44:10.411 --> 02:44:13.531]  we have a faith higher than them.
[02:44:13.531 --> 02:44:15.971]  I'm Kate Daly, your guest host in this hour.
[02:44:15.971 --> 02:44:21.051]   So grateful to Alex and his show for waking people up all around the world.
[02:44:21.051 --> 02:44:22.411]  It's truly amazing.
[02:44:22.411 --> 02:44:29.211]   All the feedback I get, the letters I get, and so appreciative of people wanting to wake
[02:44:29.211 --> 02:44:30.970]  people up and having that desire.
[02:44:31.326 --> 02:44:32.026]  And you know what?
[02:44:32.346 --> 02:44:34.227]  You ought to feel like you're in a pretty good crowd.
[02:44:35.508 --> 02:44:36.208]  You're awake!
[02:44:36.948 --> 02:44:38.649]  What a huge blessing that is right now.
[02:44:39.710 --> 02:44:43.392]  You know, this today is the Christmas message of resistance.
[02:44:44.352 --> 02:44:45.553]  Sounds strange, doesn't it?
[02:44:46.733 --> 02:44:48.814]  But even Christ's parents resisted.
[02:44:50.355 --> 02:44:51.756]  Even Christ resisted.
[02:44:53.396 --> 02:44:54.977]  His birth ought to be celebrated.
[02:44:55.978 --> 02:44:59.635]   His birth Is that important to who we are as people?
[02:44:59.896 --> 02:45:00.656]  Important to me.
[02:45:02.117 --> 02:45:04.879]  And so I do a lot of shows about how can we do this?
[02:45:05.900 --> 02:45:13.165]  How can we take that energy that we're feeling from hearing the headlines and take it and put it into something that's going to matter?
[02:45:13.805 --> 02:45:16.347]  Because I know that you and I, that's really what we want, right?
[02:45:17.428 --> 02:45:23.632]  We want to have that same fortitude and that same perseverance as those guys on the battlefield.
[02:45:24.513 --> 02:45:26.254]  We're just on a different battlefield is all.
[02:45:27.131 --> 02:45:32.916]  Our battlefield right now is a little more comfortable, but full of resistance in a different way.
[02:45:33.997 --> 02:45:36.078]  And all of us are going to end up having to sacrifice.
[02:45:36.378 --> 02:45:37.119]  We know that, right?
[02:45:38.020 --> 02:45:44.625]  I ended up, I was on a Fox News affiliate, ended up having to leave and, and own my own show in order to tell the truth.
[02:45:45.426 --> 02:45:46.046]  So what happens?
[02:45:47.928 --> 02:45:49.969]  You make a sacrifice, but then a window's open.
[02:45:51.130 --> 02:45:54.653]  And when that window is open for you, it's pretty wonderful.
[02:45:57.088 --> 02:45:57.428]  I think.
[02:45:58.829 --> 02:46:04.751]  Everybody has a story in which they've failed at some point, but then the failure brought about the biggest blessing.
[02:46:04.771 --> 02:46:11.254]  I was just watching a show about Lucille Ball, of all people, and she wanted to be an RKO starlet, right?
[02:46:11.454 --> 02:46:13.315]  It wasn't in the cards for her.
[02:46:14.335 --> 02:46:15.175]  She wanted it though.
[02:46:15.195 --> 02:46:16.296]  I'm sure she prayed for it.
[02:46:16.316 --> 02:46:18.257]  I'm sure that that's all her focus was on.
[02:46:18.277 --> 02:46:19.377]  It's all she cared about.
[02:46:22.500 --> 02:46:34.788]  In order to become one of the biggest media people, totally reinventing TV, the sitcom, bringing humor to a lot of people's lives, clean humor might I add, which is refreshing.
[02:46:35.308 --> 02:46:36.289]  And you know what?
[02:46:37.289 --> 02:46:41.192]  That window would have never been opened for her had she not failed.
[02:46:42.273 --> 02:46:51.919]  So this Christmas, instead of concentrating on our own stuff, our own junk, our own failures, concentrate on all the things that make miracles happen, the possibilities.
[02:46:52.648 --> 02:46:59.330]  Maybe you're handed a situation in which you need to leave your job right now and it's scary and you don't know how to pay the bills.
[02:47:01.171 --> 02:47:05.893]  But if you're not one of many doing that, it's not going to matter anyway.
[02:47:06.873 --> 02:47:07.913]  We lose it all anyway.
[02:47:09.294 --> 02:47:16.296]  So know that you are on the forefront in history of somebody that's already sacrificing for everyone else's liberty.
[02:47:16.736 --> 02:47:17.276]  It's huge.
[02:47:17.817 --> 02:47:18.577]  What a huge gift.
[02:47:19.993 --> 02:47:24.233]   and know that windows could be opened in ways that you never thought.
[02:47:24.233 --> 02:47:26.752]  Failure is just part of the story.
[02:47:26.752 --> 02:47:28.553]  We got to get used to it.
[02:47:28.553 --> 02:47:32.073]   Failure and stress and trials, we almost should welcome them.
[02:47:32.073 --> 02:47:35.912]  Stuff, I know, but we should welcome them.
[02:47:35.912 --> 02:47:40.313]   And to do things with humor, you know, there was a little story about a woman resisting
[02:47:40.313 --> 02:47:48.473]   a Nazi officer brushed past this little gray haired aristocratic looking old lady and she
[02:47:48.473 --> 02:47:52.153]  raised her cane and she knocked off his hat.
[02:47:52.153 --> 02:47:59.672]   And she berated him loudly for showing so little respect for his elders and embarrassed,
[02:47:59.672 --> 02:48:05.193]   he apologized quickly and he and she continued her little tirade until he fled.
[02:48:05.193 --> 02:48:15.193]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:48:06.869 --> 02:48:08.910]  He was a Nazi officer, for Pete's sakes.
[02:48:09.390 --> 02:48:12.610]  The little old lady went on about her business, laughing to herself.
[02:48:14.251 --> 02:48:17.692]  And she said, well, we'll all have to fight this war as best we can.
[02:48:18.192 --> 02:48:21.253]  That's the fourth hat I've knocked into the mud this morning.
[02:48:22.733 --> 02:48:23.713]  Don't you love that?
[02:48:24.313 --> 02:48:26.234]  That's the attitude we all need to have.
[02:48:27.474 --> 02:48:31.975]  Humor can sometimes break down some of the barriers between even the groups.
[02:48:33.616 --> 02:48:35.116]  Even in this resistance, right?
[02:48:37.086 --> 02:48:45.751]  And sometimes it's kind of what we need to be able to see and to be able to kind of see a little bit more clearly and sort of join forces.
[02:48:46.932 --> 02:48:49.553]  There's an old joke about two Romanians on a bus.
[02:48:50.034 --> 02:48:51.815]  One is sitting down, the other is standing.
[02:48:52.155 --> 02:48:55.937]  And the sitting man asks, are you a member of the Communist Party?
[02:48:55.957 --> 02:48:57.438]  He says, no, I am not.
[02:48:58.218 --> 02:48:58.979]  Are you in the military?
[02:48:59.699 --> 02:49:00.260]  No, I am not.
[02:49:01.340 --> 02:49:04.222]  You mean you're not a government or party official of any kind?
[02:49:05.021 --> 02:49:05.641]  No, I'm not.
[02:49:06.222 --> 02:49:07.803]  Then get the hell off my foot.
[02:49:07.823 --> 02:49:09.624]  I love that story.
[02:49:10.784 --> 02:49:17.908]  I love that story because it's humor that can actually help us right now in so many ways if we just get together to do it.
[02:49:19.769 --> 02:49:34.745]   And there's a function of humor that I don't know what it is, and I love the fact that we can laugh a lot about these headlines, and we can poke fun at King Fraud a lot, who doesn't even know his name.
[02:49:34.885 --> 02:49:37.666]  And I doubt he's ever actually where he says he is.
[02:49:38.606 --> 02:49:40.787]  He's green screened quite a bit.
[02:49:40.807 --> 02:49:42.927]  I always wonder what they're doing with him.
[02:49:43.007 --> 02:49:45.148]  Did they just pull him out of the freezer when they want him to talk?
[02:49:45.248 --> 02:49:45.648]  I don't know.
[02:49:47.059 --> 02:49:47.899]  Who's in his earpiece?
[02:49:48.120 --> 02:49:48.560]  Who knows?
[02:49:48.980 --> 02:49:49.700]  The guy's a joke.
[02:49:50.060 --> 02:49:51.121]  He's fun to make fun of.
[02:49:51.641 --> 02:49:55.683]  And really and truly, every time I hear, let's go Brandon, I smile a little bit.
[02:49:55.703 --> 02:49:57.004]  I love it.
[02:49:57.104 --> 02:49:57.984]  Are you kidding me?
[02:49:58.585 --> 02:49:59.665]  This is fantastic.
[02:49:59.725 --> 02:50:02.507]  Every time I see the final variant is communism.
[02:50:02.927 --> 02:50:03.687]  That's funny.
[02:50:04.027 --> 02:50:04.688]  But guess what?
[02:50:04.728 --> 02:50:06.609]  It's the funny that makes people think.
[02:50:08.610 --> 02:50:17.223]   And whether you provide a resistance of walking around the church, whether you provide a resistance of humor, It all works.
[02:50:18.124 --> 02:50:18.844]  It all works.
[02:50:19.384 --> 02:50:31.670]  And the reason I brought up personal failures and things that we grapple with is right now it's a really easy time to get stuck in the weeds into our own stuff where we think we're climbing these mountains every day.
[02:50:31.690 --> 02:50:33.831]  And maybe some of us are.
[02:50:35.251 --> 02:50:42.555]  But at the same time, we got to put that stuff aside and have a little bit more faith and a little bit less fear about the future.
[02:50:42.575 --> 02:50:48.759]   And Christmas Day, the celebration of Christmas, Honestly, should remind us of all of that, right?
[02:50:50.460 --> 02:50:52.521]  He was one of the biggest resistors of government.
[02:50:54.041 --> 02:50:56.762]  They honestly had to kill him to get him to stop talking.
[02:50:59.463 --> 02:51:01.284]  We're the truth tellers in society.
[02:51:02.705 --> 02:51:08.527]  We can poke fun because it kind of relieves some of the stress, but it makes people see things a little clearer.
[02:51:09.528 --> 02:51:14.550]  We have to get out of just being so focused on our own failures and our own problems.
[02:51:16.035 --> 02:51:18.757]  That it doesn't bring us down to the point that we stop fighting.
[02:51:19.897 --> 02:51:21.358]  We've got to keep fighting.
[02:51:22.719 --> 02:51:24.860]  And this is a great time to fill the coffers, isn't it?
[02:51:24.880 --> 02:51:28.723]  It's a great time to kind of fill that void and say, you know what?
[02:51:29.703 --> 02:51:34.626]  People have been in worse situations than us, dealing with less than us.
[02:51:37.268 --> 02:51:46.624]   So, Right now, we have it pretty comfortable and this is the time to use all the mediums that we can, social media, whatever the case may be.
[02:51:46.824 --> 02:51:48.565]  Twitter told me the other day, we miss you.
[02:51:48.585 --> 02:51:50.626]  Well, I don't miss you.
[02:51:50.646 --> 02:52:11.459]   I don't want to be on Twitter, but there are places I do want to be and I'm happy to give those messages and I'm happy to uplift and help where I can because I know that it's got to be sort of a marriage between hope And between the real hard-hitting things that we need to know about in this life.
[02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:14.500]  But there's always got to be hope.
[02:52:15.541 --> 02:52:16.081]  And you know what?
[02:52:16.121 --> 02:52:17.421]  We have mounds of it.
[02:52:18.002 --> 02:52:19.102]  We have a whole history.
[02:52:19.142 --> 02:52:21.203]  The people in history didn't even have history.
[02:52:21.283 --> 02:52:22.403]  Think about that for a minute.
[02:52:22.804 --> 02:52:25.064]  They did not have the history of people to learn from.
[02:52:25.805 --> 02:52:26.125]  We do.
[02:52:27.535 --> 02:52:28.956]  I can look back at Harold Ziegler.
[02:52:29.036 --> 02:52:33.859]  I can look back at that woman confronting the Nazi officer.
[02:52:33.879 --> 02:52:42.804]  I can look back at many situations where we had the opportunity to make people very awake, to get the masses to understand.
[02:52:44.591 --> 02:52:48.194]  And you might feel like a very small portion of people today, right?
[02:52:48.234 --> 02:52:58.062]  You might think that it's closing in on us and that the people aren't awake and that all these people are falling for all these fake media messages and the green screens and the lies and all the rest.
[02:52:58.863 --> 02:52:59.964]  You might think that.
[02:53:01.485 --> 02:53:03.446]  And a portion of that might be true.
[02:53:04.728 --> 02:53:12.174]  But the problem is, is that we don't grasp the fact that the truth has always run with a smaller crowd.
[02:53:13.286 --> 02:53:16.347]  Then the masses, that's why they call them the asses.
[02:53:16.367 --> 02:53:18.067]  I love that story.
[02:53:18.368 --> 02:53:20.488]  Anyway, but it's true though, right?
[02:53:22.049 --> 02:53:27.990]  So this Christmas, I hope that you celebrate with passion.
[02:53:29.091 --> 02:53:31.171]  I hope that you celebrate to the hilt.
[02:53:31.972 --> 02:53:34.032]  I hope that you remember what's important.
[02:53:34.672 --> 02:53:39.774]  I hope that we're focused on our liberty, our God, our country, our relationships.
[02:53:40.541 --> 02:53:43.303]  I hope that we do everything we can do to preserve this liberty.
[02:53:43.663 --> 02:53:44.863]  What a gift we've been given.
[02:53:45.704 --> 02:53:47.625]  We're not used to fighting for it all the time.
[02:53:48.525 --> 02:53:48.946]  We're not.
[02:53:50.447 --> 02:53:54.329]  And it's tough to suddenly think, oh my gosh, so much is at stake.
[02:53:54.489 --> 02:53:54.949]  And it is.
[02:53:55.589 --> 02:53:56.730]  Headlines are terrifying.
[02:53:58.671 --> 02:53:59.392]  But you know what?
[02:53:59.612 --> 02:54:01.973]  We also have God.
[02:54:02.680 --> 02:54:11.586]  And I'm sorry, but anything he can do is much stronger and much better than whatever they've been able to conceive or pull out of their hat or try to do to us.
[02:54:12.427 --> 02:54:14.268]  Because all through history, I have examples of this.
[02:54:16.089 --> 02:54:23.134]  This Christmas, let's just focus on the miracle of Christmas and know that more miracles are to come.
[02:54:23.734 --> 02:54:26.196]  And you and I are important to what's happening right now.
[02:54:26.456 --> 02:54:27.217]  He's counting on us.
[02:54:27.617 --> 02:54:28.537]  He has confidence in us.
[02:54:29.458 --> 02:54:30.599]  So we need to have confidence back.
[02:54:32.054 --> 02:54:33.455]  Merry Christmas to all of you.
[02:54:33.575 --> 02:54:34.697]  Merry Christmas to Alex.
[02:54:34.757 --> 02:54:36.899]  Merry Christmas to everybody at InfoWars.
[02:54:37.699 --> 02:54:38.260]  Thanks, you guys.
[02:54:38.320 --> 02:54:38.820]  Kate Daly.
[02:54:43.605 --> 02:54:48.469]  Ho, ho, ho, ho!
[02:54:48.288 --> 02:54:55.288]  Ho ho ho ho!
[02:54:55.288 --> 02:54:58.807]  Merry Christmas!
[02:54:58.807 --> 02:55:04.568]   Learn how the social engineers use a three step process to totally enslave us.
[02:55:04.636 --> 02:55:05.116]  Isolate.
[02:55:05.716 --> 02:55:06.257]  Control.
[02:55:06.998 --> 02:55:07.438]  Abuse.
[02:55:08.239 --> 02:55:16.565]  In Reset Wars Part 1 and 2, we expose the tools, the systems, that the planetary social engineers use to keep humanity in a trance.
[02:55:17.106 --> 02:55:22.310]  And we break down how to successfully break free of it and empower yourself and others around you.

[02:55:29.039 --> 02:55:39.328]  All across the world, whether you're in Canada or whether you're in Australia or Germany, the politicians use the exact same slogans like Build Back Better and The Great Reset.
[02:55:39.889 --> 02:55:44.272]  And now they're telling everyone that, oh, sorry, it's permanent.
[02:55:44.433 --> 02:55:49.393]   You're always going to wear a mask, and you're going to get multiple shots up to six, seven,
[02:55:49.393 --> 02:55:51.673]   eight, nine, even 10 times a year.
[02:55:51.673 --> 02:55:53.473]  And that'll be on your app.
[02:55:53.473 --> 02:55:57.913]   And if you don't have it on your app, you're not going to be allowed to buy and sell or leave
[02:55:57.913 --> 02:55:58.792]  your house.
[02:55:58.792 --> 02:56:05.472]   And now, countries like Germany are saying, we may make it mandatory.
[02:56:05.093 --> 02:56:08.594]  In fact, now Germany says starting February 1st, it will be mandatory.
[02:56:08.614 --> 02:56:13.115]  And now the unelected head of the EU Commission, she says they're looking at making it mandatory.
[02:56:13.135 --> 02:56:15.676]  And now Boris Johnson is saying mandatory.
[02:56:15.996 --> 02:56:19.657]  That means come to your house, forcibly inject you.
[02:56:20.677 --> 02:56:23.918]  And what's insane is all the statistics, all the numbers are out.
[02:56:24.439 --> 02:56:27.219]  It's the vaccinated that are sick and dying because it's not a vaccine.
[02:56:27.500 --> 02:56:32.061]  It's a gene therapy that erases your immune system.
[02:56:32.884 --> 02:56:34.065]  Just search it yourself.
[02:56:34.185 --> 02:56:39.429]  COVID-19, Pfizer-Moderna vaccines, lower immunity.
[02:56:39.729 --> 02:56:40.730]  And find out how they do it.
[02:56:40.770 --> 02:56:43.132]  They turn off your killer T's.
[02:56:43.152 --> 02:56:45.534]  They don't kill them like HIV does.
[02:56:46.134 --> 02:56:46.975]  It just turns them off.
[02:56:48.216 --> 02:56:49.757]  And then you know what happens.
[02:56:50.018 --> 02:56:55.382]  Killer T's stop cancer, they stop viruses, they stop bacteria, they stop infections.
[02:56:57.005 --> 02:57:04.895]  We're having our defenses literally lowered and now the Pentagon, that means the globalist controlled occupied system, it's not our military anymore at the top.
[02:57:06.037 --> 02:57:14.108]  I said, oh, we've just so happened been working in secret on an omnibus COVID shot that stops all spike proteins.
[02:57:15.350 --> 02:57:21.435]  Well, viruses in our body, most of them are good and actually share information with our cells and other life forms.
[02:57:21.776 --> 02:57:22.837]  That's what the science shows.
[02:57:23.677 --> 02:57:35.868]  And so attacking the spike protein that isn't just on viruses but is on other cells in our bodies is going to cause massive autoimmune disorders, ADE, the list goes on and on.
[02:57:36.128 --> 02:57:46.510]   And the scientists that warned of this a year and a half ago when the injections were starting have now all We're entering the darkest time in human history.
[02:57:47.811 --> 02:57:48.951]  But thank God for you.
[02:57:49.252 --> 02:57:51.473]  And thank God that we have InfoWars.
[02:57:52.253 --> 02:57:57.396]  And thank God that we knew about the globalist plans from Operation Lockstep many years ago and have been warning people.
[02:57:57.976 --> 02:58:07.041]  And so now, top scientists like Dr. Wolfgang Wudarg and Dr. Michael Yedon and others have come out and said, no, this is a depopulation program.
[02:58:08.098 --> 02:58:12.140]  And by the third shot, you basically have no immune system anymore.
[02:58:14.361 --> 02:58:23.226]  And the globalists are counting on this being so horrific, so horrible, that people just can't even come to grips with how sinister and out of control this is.
[02:58:24.090 --> 02:58:28.792]  So that's why I'm asking all of you now, more than ever, to pray to God for a global awakening.
[02:58:29.212 --> 02:58:40.637]  And to pray to God that your friends, your family, your neighbors, and others don't just have the scales taken from their eyes, but that they be given a spirit of enlightenment and leadership to help wake up and warn others.
[02:58:40.717 --> 02:58:42.677]  Because they're not coming for our children.
[02:58:42.918 --> 02:58:43.958]  They've come for our children.
[02:58:44.178 --> 02:58:48.620]  And children all over the Western world taking these shots are having heart attacks, they're getting sick, they're dying.
[02:58:48.720 --> 02:58:53.662]  And now they're doing testing on babies and coming after the newborns and saying they want to make that mandatory.
[02:58:54.042 --> 02:58:57.224]  Hell, a lot of major cities have already made it mandatory for five-year-olds and up.
[02:58:57.825 --> 02:59:01.687]  It's not an if, it's not a when, it's now here.
[02:59:02.208 --> 02:59:03.769]  And please continue to keep us on air.

[02:59:39.986 --> 02:59:41.427]  We're not engaged in a revolution.
[02:59:41.507 --> 02:59:49.511]  We're engaged in the defense of our republic against a globalist, corporate revolution of the elite against we, the people.
[02:59:50.131 --> 02:59:51.672]  This is an attack on the Renaissance.
[02:59:51.712 --> 02:59:54.173]  This is an attack on humanity and free will.
[02:59:54.413 --> 02:59:56.515]  This is an attack on our very lives.
[02:59:57.395 --> 03:00:00.138]  That's why we've launched 1776coin.com.
[03:00:00.538 --> 03:00:10.027]  It's not just an amazing limited edition coin, but it will also fund the next move, the next phase in the resistance to the globalist tyranny.
[03:00:10.948 --> 03:00:12.569]  You may have heard of the legend of St.
[03:00:12.609 --> 03:00:13.830]  George slaying the dragon.
[03:00:14.731 --> 03:00:14.931]  St.
[03:00:14.971 --> 03:00:20.156]  George stands for the courage to face adversity in order to defend the innocent.
[03:00:21.311 --> 03:00:24.053]  The triumph of good over evil for centuries.
[03:00:25.554 --> 03:00:25.794]  St.
[03:00:25.894 --> 03:00:34.660]  George represented the idea of courageous leadership and with it the underlying popular will to be governed well and protected.
[03:00:35.681 --> 03:00:47.649]  On the obverse of each one ounce 1776 founding member silver round, you will see a rendition of George Washington slaying the dragon and the Latin inscription, Sic Semper Tyrannis.
[03:00:48.569 --> 03:00:56.389]   Sic Semper Tyrannis literally translates as thus always to tyrants. A tyrant by definition is a ruler
[03:00:56.389 --> 03:01:00.549]   who arbitrarily and unjustly wields power to oppress the citizenry.
[03:01:00.549 --> 03:01:08.259]   The idea is that a tyrant will surely meet a dire end. Our rendition of George Washington slaying the
[03:01:08.259 --> 03:01:12.949]   dragon represents victory over tyranny. On the reverse
[03:01:12.949 --> 03:01:20.839]   of each one ounce 1776 founding member silver coin you will see a rendition of an American eagle with the
[03:01:20.839 --> 03:01:23.349]   inscription 1776 above its head
[03:01:23.349 --> 03:01:24.549]  and a globe at its feet.
[03:01:24.549 --> 03:01:26.108]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[03:01:25.796 --> 03:01:27.918]  The American Eagle represents freedom.
[03:01:28.638 --> 03:01:33.962]  The founding fathers made an appropriate choice when they selected the bald eagle as the emblem of the nation.
[03:01:34.482 --> 03:01:40.886]  The fierce beauty and proud independence of this great bird amply symbolizes the strength and freedom of America.
[03:01:41.823 --> 03:01:49.584]  The globe represents the world, with North America centered, representing our strategic value and symbol of freedom to the entire world.
