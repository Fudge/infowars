[00:00:15.501 --> 00:00:18.302]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:20.943 --> 00:00:22.743]  Hello Americans!
[00:00:23.343 --> 00:00:28.625]  As you have heard, we are testing you with Q-tip with anal swab.
[00:00:29.125 --> 00:00:33.827]  Your diplomats do not like it, but Biden says it will happen.
[00:00:34.307 --> 00:00:40.389]  So now it comes to America, because you do whatever communist China say.
[00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:40.989]  So,
[00:00:41.647 --> 00:00:44.508]  Oh, let me get it.
[00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:47.189]  I was keeping it warm for you.
[00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:53.272]  Now I put it inside your boot.
[00:00:53.692 --> 00:00:55.132]  That wasn't so hard.
[00:00:55.513 --> 00:00:57.673]  You are learning to be humiliated.
[00:00:57.693 --> 00:00:58.914]  We own your debt.
[00:00:59.054 --> 00:01:00.174]  We own Hollywood.
[00:01:00.595 --> 00:01:02.835]  And we steal elections from Donald Trump.
[00:01:03.316 --> 00:01:04.896]  Now we take your guns.
[00:01:05.937 --> 00:01:08.958]  So, bend over every time you travel.
[00:01:09.617 --> 00:01:13.406]  China Test will have to see that you do not have color.
[00:01:13.426 --> 00:01:15.209]  Does not matter if P.E.S.I.
[00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.216]  act is fake, your media work for us!
[00:01:21.244 --> 00:01:25.566]  It was so easy to penetrate your diplomatic core.
[00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:33.528]  And now, even your school children will walk like big ones, once dragged and give you anal slop.
[00:01:33.808 --> 00:01:34.749]  Ha ha ha!
[00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:41.111]  So easy to bring the so-called superpower to its knees, thanks to the COVID hubs.
[00:01:41.511 --> 00:01:41.971]  Ha ha!
[00:01:42.251 --> 00:01:49.194]  Remember, do not take vitamin D3, so normal viruses will kill you, and you will live in fear and never reopen.
[00:01:49.534 --> 00:01:49.734]  Ha!
[00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.591]  We have shut down your Keystone Pipeline.
[00:01:53.972 --> 00:01:56.673]  We are now coming for your guns and dissolving your border.
[00:01:56.973 --> 00:01:59.155]  I mean, I mean, Joe Biden is doing that.
[00:01:59.535 --> 00:02:01.436]  He is not a puppet.
[00:02:01.776 --> 00:02:03.577]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:02:04.037 --> 00:02:07.519]  And also, Joe Biden say it's good that we invade Hong Kong.
[00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.401]  And good that we run death camp with Apple.
[00:02:10.841 --> 00:02:12.162]  For we got
[00:02:12.762 --> 00:02:14.943]  Good Joe Biden, good!
[00:02:15.483 --> 00:02:28.206]  We send you more orders to sign and more COVID restrictions on your people so China dominates the economy while America permanently closed.
[00:02:28.766 --> 00:02:33.867]  And we work with our friend, Mr. Pink Sweater Bill Gates.
[00:02:35.578 --> 00:02:37.079]  Your country is lost.
[00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:42.060]  We control almost your entire Democratic Party and many Republicans too.
[00:02:42.441 --> 00:02:46.822]  Dianne Feinstein, Eric Swalwell, and of course, Lutheran.
[00:02:47.542 --> 00:02:52.284]  Ah, Mitch McConnell's wife worked for us and so he do what we say.
[00:02:53.505 --> 00:02:57.526]  You have no hope now that we control your voting machines.
[00:02:57.926 --> 00:03:04.629]  Whatever you do, do not visit InfoWars.com or ban that video or I hurt you.
[00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:09.671]  Oh, no, no, I don't even know what this is!
[00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:10.352]  How did he get here?
[00:03:11.733 --> 00:03:13.815]  I just caught you, American!
[00:03:14.135 --> 00:03:16.197]  You visited Bandar Video!
[00:03:16.217 --> 00:03:20.340]  Oh, Mark Zuckerberg and others angry at you!
[00:03:20.921 --> 00:03:26.405]  Do what CNN says and do not visit Bandar Video, or I have to hurt you!
[00:03:26.425 --> 00:03:30.088]  It comes from China.
[00:03:39.881 --> 00:03:56.460]  In modern times, we can trace weather modification back to James Pollard Espy, who published The Philosophy of Storms in 1841, wherein he explained how storms are driven by winds, vertical convection, and condensation.
[00:03:57.719 --> 00:04:03.962]  Scientists from all over began theorizing ways of controlling these factors to manipulate the weather.
[00:04:05.102 --> 00:04:11.705]  And by 1946, General Electric began using dry ice to seed clouds and create snow.
[00:04:13.306 --> 00:04:25.511]  The first scientifically controlled experiment of successful weather modification occurred in 1948, when Dr. Irving Langmuir was able to produce rain by artificially seeding clouds.
[00:04:27.182 --> 00:04:29.163]  During the Vietnam War, the U.S.
[00:04:29.263 --> 00:04:34.087]  Army used cloud seeding to extend the monsoon season in specific areas.
[00:04:35.107 --> 00:04:45.415]  This controversial use of weather modification as a weapon of war was classified, and when it was later revealed to the public, people were understandably concerned.
[00:04:46.335 --> 00:04:59.524]  In 1977, the Convention on the Prohibition of Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques was signed in Geneva, with the hopes of preventing any nation from using weather modification as a means of war.
[00:05:00.605 --> 00:05:07.729]  By the end of the 20th century, dozens of countries were using cloud seeding and other techniques to successfully modify the weather.
[00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:20.794]  In 2008, Beijing's Institute of Artificial Influence on the Weather announced its intention of manipulating the weather to ensure optimum conditions for the Olympics.
[00:05:20.954 --> 00:05:28.216]  In 2010, Abu Dhabi was able to produce dozens of storms creating rain, hail, wind gales and lightning.
[00:05:30.535 --> 00:05:42.759]  As technology and weather modification advanced, it was not openly discussed in the public forum, and after decades of successful operations, was considered a conspiracy theory in pop culture.
[00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:46.740]  I've read some theories that HAARP can be used to manipulate the weather.
[00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:47.820]  Is this possible?
[00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:51.201]  Yeah, HAARP is... I mean, I'm a Healy.
[00:05:51.441 --> 00:05:51.861]  What is it?
[00:05:52.361 --> 00:05:54.002]  High altitude...
[00:05:55.194 --> 00:05:59.916]  Radio, pension... I always forget the acronym.
[00:06:00.676 --> 00:06:16.502]  There are people who are sure that the government is stockpiling aliens and controlling everything about anything we would ever think about, and they clearly have never worked for the government because the level of incompetence of the government and inefficiency
[00:06:20.123 --> 00:06:23.864]  It's true that you could manipulate the weather like they did during the Olympics in China.
[00:06:23.904 --> 00:06:29.666]  It's not that you can't manipulate the weather, it's that you would really have any serious control.
[00:06:29.726 --> 00:06:32.967]  Yeah, a lot of the weather happens in many places.
[00:06:33.907 --> 00:06:40.269]  It comes about from the heat balance, from the energy coming from the sun, what it reflects off of, what it gets absorbed by.
[00:06:40.771 --> 00:06:46.516]  What the up currents do, what the down drafts do, what the rotation of the Earth is doing, all of this factors in.
[00:06:47.056 --> 00:06:57.725]  And so I have not been convinced by any of the reports to suggest that experiments in the upper atmosphere, physics experiments, are having any effect on our weather whatsoever.
[00:06:57.965 --> 00:06:58.185]  Right.
[00:06:58.626 --> 00:07:06.612]  And it would be tragic if we wanted to say, oh, that's why it's getting hotter in the world, OK?
[00:07:06.692 --> 00:07:08.494]  Because there's some experiment happening.
[00:07:09.855 --> 00:07:14.121]  That would be tragic because we would be missing the 900-pound gorilla in the room.
[00:07:15.643 --> 00:07:23.132]  In 2008, articles were published on how scientists were learning how to steer hurricanes by injecting heat into the upper atmosphere.
[00:07:24.096 --> 00:07:30.298]  The High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program, otherwise known as HAARP, jointly funded by the U.S.
[00:07:30.358 --> 00:07:38.581]  military and DARPA, is used to excite a limited area of the ionosphere using microwaves that produce high levels of heat.
[00:07:39.822 --> 00:07:41.903]  On October 27, 2012, Hurricane Sandy weakened to a tropical storm.
[00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:51.692]  Microwave imagery shows a thick red beam was then directed at Hurricane Sandy.
[00:07:52.673 --> 00:08:01.717]  Immediately following the red beam, Sandy is strengthened to a Category 1 hurricane and takes the mysterious left turn into New Jersey.
[00:08:03.538 --> 00:08:11.622]  In 2016, former Director of the CIA John Brennan spoke of the real threat of weather modification technology.
[00:08:12.714 --> 00:08:21.862]  Another example is the array of technologies, often referred to collectively as geoengineering, that potentially could help reverse the warming effects of global climate change.
[00:08:22.902 --> 00:08:36.234]  One that has gained my personal attention is stratospheric aerosol injection, or SAI, a method of seeding the stratosphere with particles that can help reflect the sun's heat in much the same way that volcanic eruptions do.
[00:08:37.458 --> 00:08:47.946]  An SAI program could limit global temperature increases, reducing some risks associated with higher temperatures and providing the world economy additional time to transition from fossil fuels.
[00:08:49.046 --> 00:08:51.028]  This process is also relatively inexpensive.
[00:08:51.628 --> 00:08:58.273]  The National Research Council estimates that a fully deployed SAI program would cost about $10 billion yearly.
[00:08:59.454 --> 00:09:06.019]  As promising as it may be, moving forward on SAI would also raise a number of challenges for our government and for the international community.
[00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:20.372]  On the technical side, greenhouse gas emission reductions would still have to accompany SAI to address other climate change effects, such as ocean acidification, because SAI alone would not remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.
[00:09:21.533 --> 00:09:33.824]  On the geopolitical side, the technology's potential to alter weather patterns and benefit certain regions of the world at the expense of other regions could trigger sharp opposition by some nations.
[00:09:35.359 --> 00:09:48.573]  In December of 2020, it is announced that China will be expanding its weather modification program, saying it will be able to cover half the country in artificial rain and snow in just four years from now.
[00:09:50.154 --> 00:09:56.020]  In a time-lapse video, this winter's polar vortex behaved as expected for nearly two months.
[00:09:57.041 --> 00:10:11.716]  Then, on January 20th, the same day as Joe Biden's inauguration, a swirling black hole can be seen punching through the storm above China, upsetting the polar vortex, and ultimately pushing it down to Texas.
[00:10:12.898 --> 00:10:20.041]  The power was shut off, dozens were killed in their own beds, and the government blamed fossil fuel technologies.
[00:10:20.221 --> 00:10:27.304]  The bottom line is, Texas thought it could go at it alone, and built a system that ignored climate change.
[00:10:27.344 --> 00:10:28.905]  It was not what's called resilient.
[00:10:29.365 --> 00:10:31.206]  And now Texas is paying the price.
[00:10:31.406 --> 00:10:32.666]  I hope they learn the lesson.
[00:10:32.686 --> 00:10:41.830]  When we build power, when we build anything now, we have to take into account that climate change is real, or people will be caught the way the people in Texas were.
[00:10:43.024 --> 00:10:49.026]  Now Bill Gates is warning that climate change, along with bioterrorism, are the next big threats.
[00:10:50.946 --> 00:11:01.629]  If they can convince you that weather control is a fantasy of conspiracy theorists, and if they can make it snow where and when they want, then it's checkmate for the globalists.
[00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:07.431]  Now we can see why they have made the global warming hoax their biggest agenda.
[00:11:08.831 --> 00:11:10.952]  For InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[00:11:18.359 --> 00:11:18.559]  Right.
[00:11:18.919 --> 00:11:20.400]  Sarah, what's your feelings?
[00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:22.221]  How will you remember him?
[00:11:22.861 --> 00:11:27.383]  Well, many people are mourning the loss of him today and many are not.
[00:11:27.703 --> 00:11:30.905]  And I was not a fan at all of Rush Limbaugh.
[00:11:31.525 --> 00:11:37.108]  I think he paved the way for political extremism and pushed baseless claims.
[00:11:37.148 --> 00:11:39.069]  He was the beginning of conspiracy theories.
[00:11:39.229 --> 00:11:39.709]  He was like
[00:11:40.109 --> 00:12:07.497]  The predecessor to the Alex Jones is a lot of the things we're seeing that we don't like now he in a sense kind of bastardized the party in a way because I know there are conservative ideals that Sonny was referencing and and and we're you know many of us are saying please speak up and and represent those because I don't like to even think of him as representing Republicans or conservatives he he represents very extreme views he said a ton of despicable things that we could never we don't even have enough time on one show to cover
[00:12:07.878 --> 00:12:13.439]  But some of the most offensive were at the LGBTQ community during the AIDS epidemic.
[00:12:13.619 --> 00:12:21.781]  He used to run a regular segment called AIDS Updates and mocked the deaths of gay men by playing Dionne Warwick's I'll Never Love This Way Again.
[00:12:21.801 --> 00:12:29.463]  And as recently as 2020, said the country couldn't handle Pete Buttigieg as a president because they'd be sick watching him kiss his husband.
[00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:36.865]  This stuff is just, I have a visceral reaction to so many of his words, but the first thing that ran through my head when I saw the news was
[00:12:37.566 --> 00:12:38.707]  Now it's Judgment Day.
[00:12:39.107 --> 00:12:45.111]  At the end of our lives, it's just us answering for everything we did, who we were, what we said, and how we treated people.
[00:12:45.471 --> 00:12:48.793]  And so now, Judgment Day has arrived for Rush Limbaugh.
[00:13:00.649 --> 00:13:02.330]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:04.531]  There is a war on, for your mind.
[00:13:04.811 --> 00:13:07.933]  I mean, I'm not even worthy to be bringing you information this powerful.
[00:13:08.553 --> 00:13:12.015]  And I hope that you pay attention to what we cover here, minute by minute.
[00:13:13.415 --> 00:13:16.217]  Because I've had chills since last night.
[00:13:17.697 --> 00:13:20.459]  This just confirms everything else we've already researched.
[00:13:22.728 --> 00:13:33.662]  A Rockefeller study envisions future dictatorship controlled by elite, millions being killed, mandatory quarantines, checkpoints, the end of the family, everything that's in the other documents.
[00:13:33.702 --> 00:13:39.749]  But this dovetails with all the other Rockefeller Foundation documents about the GMO food to sterilize you and the forced vaccines.
[00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:46.333]  The hell we're already living in that's just going to continue to intensify until we take our governments back from these eugenics madmen.
[00:13:46.513 --> 00:13:49.075]  But that story is up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:13:49.255 --> 00:13:52.517]  The question is, will you have the courage to really do the research yourself?
[00:13:52.597 --> 00:13:55.779]  Because I don't want you to just sit here and hear me make these claims.
[00:13:56.539 --> 00:14:08.024]  These people are so arrogant that they write policy papers, so many of them, that they're producing these policy papers and reports and white papers so fast that you could never read them all.
[00:14:08.404 --> 00:14:11.386]  It is an open conspiracy against you and your family.
[00:14:11.806 --> 00:14:16.328]  I pray to God, I pray to my Heavenly Father Jesus Christ every night to give me the strength
[00:14:17.148 --> 00:14:28.774]  And the will to be able to face this horror and to give me the strength to carry on because I know why a lot of you don't want to look at this information and just want to comment on the YouTube videos or on message boards that I'm a liar.
[00:14:30.695 --> 00:14:31.075]  I know why.
[00:14:31.675 --> 00:14:32.776]  Because it's scary.
[00:14:37.218 --> 00:14:39.159]  You're not going to be able to go to the ballgames anymore.
[00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:43.941]  You're not going to be able to just go out and get drunk with your friends.
[00:14:43.961 --> 00:14:44.922]  You're not going to be able to just
[00:14:46.442 --> 00:14:48.464]  You know, go out and enjoy yourself all the time.
[00:14:49.665 --> 00:15:12.823]  The only chance we've got of beating this scientific dictatorship, this creeping death that takes its time to incrementally enslave you, mentally, psychologically, physically, spiritually, the only way to defeat it is for the rank and file of this planet to realize that you have a choice to make on what your destiny is going to be.
[00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:19.543]  Once you face this information, once you've consciously admitted it to yourself, it will take over your life.
[00:15:19.963 --> 00:15:21.304]  It should take over your life.
[00:15:22.064 --> 00:15:22.844]  I mean, what else?
[00:15:23.485 --> 00:15:24.405]  What else could it do?
[00:15:26.746 --> 00:15:37.092]  We've got to get past the artificial stigma that the controlled corporate media has been putting out for decades, ahead of their open... of unveiling of planetary dictatorship.
[00:15:38.803 --> 00:15:42.125]  They all talk about how we need a police state to carry this out.
[00:15:42.185 --> 00:15:49.889]  Canada and the United States are going to work in lockstep to display the seriousness of our commitment at both home and abroad.
[00:15:50.169 --> 00:15:53.290]  Win, lose, or draw, you need to choose a side.
[00:15:55.091 --> 00:15:55.852]  InfoWars.
[00:15:56.212 --> 00:15:57.693]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:16:08.923 --> 00:16:11.764]  It's Saturday, February 27th.
[00:16:11.784 --> 00:16:12.484]  The year is 2021.
[00:16:12.644 --> 00:16:14.085]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:16:14.125 --> 00:16:14.965]  February 27th, 1933.
[00:16:15.146 --> 00:16:19.227]  If my memory serves,
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:37.822]  This isn't some trick I'm doing at the start of this Saturday show.
[00:16:38.382 --> 00:16:42.685]  That's when Hitler firebombed the Reichstag and set up his dictatorship.
[00:16:43.146 --> 00:16:48.350]  Guys, will you check for me and see if the day the Reichstag fire in 1933 was February 27th?
[00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:52.693]  I just, I looked at the board over there and it says February 27th, 2021.
[00:16:53.134 --> 00:17:00.039]  And sure as hell, that's the date of that Reichstag event.
[00:17:01.437 --> 00:17:03.238]  Okay, here we are on Saturday.
[00:17:03.438 --> 00:17:05.339]  I really appreciate the crew.
[00:17:05.499 --> 00:17:06.160]  Yep, that's it.
[00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:07.761]  February 27th, February 1933.
[00:17:07.921 --> 00:17:23.449]  I want to thank the crew for coming in on this Saturday to take this emergency transmission because we've got incredible news and incredible times mean I can't sit on my arse, as they would say in Scotland.
[00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:25.871]  So I'm going to do my very, very best
[00:17:27.165 --> 00:17:29.626]  to lay all of this out for you today.
[00:17:30.267 --> 00:17:41.253]  And then we have the great activist joining us coming up in a little while, Chris Sky, who has been protesting the lockdowns, not just in Canada, but all over the world.
[00:17:41.693 --> 00:17:50.358]  And the fact that they are a premeditated, permanent breakdown of human society meant to bankrupt human society and starve us to death.
[00:17:51.799 --> 00:17:55.761]  That is quite the statement, but it's actually true, isn't it?
[00:17:57.093 --> 00:18:04.215]  So the first thing I'm gonna hit is the incredible breaking news on this front.
[00:18:05.075 --> 00:18:24.321]  Klaus Schwab and the Dabos Group that are the private corporate arm of the UN have announced how beautiful it is to have quiet cities and how noise pollution was down during lockdowns and how wonderful future lockdowns are going to be.
[00:18:26.274 --> 00:18:36.379]  Now understand, when you sit there and are on lockdown for a few months, it bankrupts your currency, you go into debt, it kills infrastructure, you're sinking towards third world status.
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:43.383]  You're rapidly approaching being in a homeless camp.
[00:18:45.444 --> 00:18:50.746]  But now Klaus Schwab, who in his own book said, after COVID will be like after Christ.
[00:18:51.347 --> 00:18:53.668]  It will dominate every facet of the world.
[00:18:56.291 --> 00:19:10.196]  Klaus Schwab has come out and said how beautiful it was to have everything quiet, and no evil humans about, so the elites could fly around on their private jet airplanes, and how great it is that the third world is starving to death en masse.
[00:19:10.296 --> 00:19:14.898]  I mean, this is so evil, but it's out in the open, dolled up like it's a good thing.
[00:19:15.638 --> 00:19:18.419]  Drinking sewage is where you get your water, Bill Gates says.
[00:19:18.799 --> 00:19:22.220]  You're gonna eat synthetic meat when you're lucky, made out of cockroach blood.
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:23.801]  You're going to
[00:19:25.745 --> 00:19:26.966]  Be poor and like it.
[00:19:27.846 --> 00:19:28.967]  You're going to have nothing.
[00:19:29.387 --> 00:19:30.387]  You're going to own nothing.
[00:19:32.688 --> 00:19:33.769]  You're going to eat weeds.
[00:19:33.989 --> 00:19:34.929]  You're going to eat bugs.
[00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:38.251]  These are all... And you're like, why would they say that?
[00:19:38.271 --> 00:19:40.412]  It's like, hey, step right up.
[00:19:40.472 --> 00:19:41.893]  We got bugs for you.
[00:19:41.973 --> 00:19:43.253]  We got seaweed for you.
[00:19:43.774 --> 00:19:48.596]  Because they're going to shut things off and only let you have this and make you eat it.
[00:19:50.977 --> 00:19:52.738]  Because Soylent Green is made out of people.
[00:19:53.968 --> 00:20:03.076]  They're going to make you become predatory and agree to killing the old and agree to killing the low IQ so that you get a slot at the table and get some money.
[00:20:03.516 --> 00:20:05.258]  But then in the end, you get it too.
[00:20:07.159 --> 00:20:09.820]  So let me show you these incredible headlines right here.
[00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:15.082]  House dims past Biden's $1.9 trillion COVID relief package.
[00:20:15.642 --> 00:20:22.844]  Most of it goes to Democrat blue cities to line their own pockets, but it gets you used to surviving off a check they bring you.
[00:20:23.424 --> 00:20:33.508]  Not tomatoes you grow in your backyard, not cows you raise on your ranch, not car engines you fix, not children you teach, not as a nurse people you help or heal.
[00:20:34.912 --> 00:20:38.734]  But a check that comes to you administered by robots.
[00:20:40.974 --> 00:20:52.219]  Meanwhile, report Biden admin to charge White House reporters $170 per COVID test amid fears smaller outlets will be squeezed out.
[00:20:52.759 --> 00:20:56.241]  PCR instant computer test costs them nothing.
[00:20:57.181 --> 00:21:00.022]  They charge you that to then preclude all the smaller players.
[00:21:00.563 --> 00:21:03.944]  Or if they don't like you, you're pre-programmed in the machine to be denied.
[00:21:05.267 --> 00:21:11.050]  These are internal checkpoints, and we're just allowing big tech to roll this fraud out.
[00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:15.031]  Even if the test was real, it'd be tyranny, but the test is a fraud.
[00:21:15.612 --> 00:21:16.252]  Theranos 2.0.
[00:21:18.473 --> 00:21:22.775]  That leads us to this New York Times article from way back in April of last year, and it came true.
[00:21:23.135 --> 00:21:28.757]  An extra 15 million people starved to death thanks to the COVID lockdown, not COVID-19.
[00:21:29.878 --> 00:21:32.979]  More than 10 times the global COVID death died from the lockdown.
[00:21:33.299 --> 00:21:35.000]  Klaus Schwab is pleased.
[00:21:35.842 --> 00:21:39.905]  Instead of coronavirus, the hunger will kill us, a global food crisis looms.
[00:21:40.685 --> 00:21:44.467]  But don't worry, the United Nations is there.
[00:21:44.487 --> 00:21:49.911]  And they're going to raise money to feed the poor, but it really won't get there.
[00:21:52.012 --> 00:22:01.458]  World Economic Forum deletes latest video after sharing global lockdowns that push 100 million humans into extreme poverty.
[00:22:02.995 --> 00:22:04.276]  We're going to play you this video.
[00:22:04.736 --> 00:22:07.117]  It's up on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:22:08.058 --> 00:22:09.399]  And it is disgusting.
[00:22:10.839 --> 00:22:12.640]  You're like, why do they do that?
[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:13.701]  Like, oh, it's so great.
[00:22:13.761 --> 00:22:14.662]  No cars are moving.
[00:22:14.902 --> 00:22:16.122]  Everybody's becoming bankrupt.
[00:22:16.142 --> 00:22:17.103]  Everyone's going into debt.
[00:22:17.463 --> 00:22:18.904]  The currencies are being devalued.
[00:22:19.184 --> 00:22:20.425]  The third world starving to death.
[00:22:20.445 --> 00:22:22.946]  But Klaus Schwab is like, look at it from his perspective.
[00:22:23.406 --> 00:22:25.368]  I don't have to hear the cars outside.
[00:22:25.928 --> 00:22:27.009]  Everyone is starving.
[00:22:27.189 --> 00:22:28.009]  I am in control.
[00:22:28.029 --> 00:22:29.390]  I have a private jet airplane.
[00:22:31.903 --> 00:22:38.166]  They created this big, giant bubble of quadrillions of fake dollars and yen and yon and euros and pounds.
[00:22:38.746 --> 00:22:40.327]  And then you're like, oh, they're going to go to jail!
[00:22:40.387 --> 00:22:41.588]  Jeffrey Epstein's busted!
[00:22:41.848 --> 00:22:42.948]  Bill Gates is busted!
[00:22:43.849 --> 00:22:44.209]  Oh no!
[00:22:44.469 --> 00:22:52.353]  They just shut everything off in a technocracy and make you think about wearing a mask or what's going to happen for your next paycheck under the global social credit score.
[00:22:52.793 --> 00:22:54.394]  That's how they get control of you.
[00:22:54.414 --> 00:22:56.195]  And you're now in the jaws of it.
[00:22:56.715 --> 00:22:59.777]  And submitting to it only makes it worse.
[00:23:02.782 --> 00:23:13.095]  World Economic Forum deletes the latest video after cheering global lockdowns that pushed 100 million humans into extreme poverty and mass starvation.
[00:23:15.057 --> 00:23:20.965]  Yes, even though Twitter is an ecosphere, in fact, we just pulled it up as an InfoWars.com article.
[00:23:22.025 --> 00:23:27.148]  In the carousel at the top, where it shows Google, Facebook, Twitter, and others.
[00:23:27.869 --> 00:23:33.292]  And they've gone from 60% of people on there being leftist to like 5% being conservative.
[00:23:34.653 --> 00:23:39.476]  So from 40% to 5%, they're totally censoring everybody off of it.
[00:23:39.736 --> 00:23:49.302]  But despite the fact that that's happening, only liberals are in their little bubble chamber, all feeling superior when their schmuck's being sold out and destroyed.
[00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:53.531]  It was thoroughly discredited.
[00:23:53.571 --> 00:23:54.472]  Everybody attacked it.
[00:23:54.592 --> 00:23:54.852]  New!
[00:23:55.273 --> 00:24:08.022]  Klaus Schwab's World Economic Forum tweeted yesterday that lockdowns are quietly improving cities around the world, accompanied by a video showing deserted streets, empty factories, and grounded planes.
[00:24:08.922 --> 00:24:12.665]  After backlash, they deleted the video.
[00:24:14.366 --> 00:24:16.388]  Oh, but I was talking to a lady that I know.
[00:24:17.423 --> 00:24:20.183]  Whose husband is a professional cyclist lives here in town.
[00:24:20.924 --> 00:24:24.744]  And I was talking to her a few weeks ago and she said, I said, listen, she's from New Zealand.
[00:24:24.764 --> 00:24:28.005]  I said, listen, you know, they're going to bring the lockdowns back and it's never going to end.
[00:24:28.045 --> 00:24:28.825]  She goes, it doesn't matter.
[00:24:28.845 --> 00:24:29.865]  I'm going back to New Zealand.
[00:24:30.225 --> 00:24:36.346]  She showed me a photo so proudly with the prime minister of New Zealand a few weeks ago at a beach party and no one's wearing masks.
[00:24:36.366 --> 00:24:38.807]  She said, no one has COVID in the country.
[00:24:39.327 --> 00:24:40.567]  No positives.
[00:24:40.587 --> 00:24:41.867]  So we're allowed to go out without masks.
[00:24:41.907 --> 00:24:45.948]  And I said, don't you get, that's about a computer saying you can go out and not wear a mask.
[00:24:46.548 --> 00:24:51.273]  I said, I predict within a few months they'll claim new COVIDs in the country and lock the country down again.
[00:24:51.293 --> 00:24:52.955]  And she was upset.
[00:24:53.516 --> 00:24:54.537]  She wanted that pride.
[00:24:56.239 --> 00:24:56.659]  Guess what?
[00:24:57.380 --> 00:24:58.661]  They just announced martial law.
[00:24:58.962 --> 00:24:59.402]  Here it is.
[00:24:59.482 --> 00:25:07.431]  New Zealand Prime Minister plunges Auckland into second lockdown a month after new COVID-19 cases detected.
[00:25:08.464 --> 00:25:18.331]  So, they put you on a chain, put you in a prison, let you out, put you back in, but each time, each time the noose tightens around the chicken neck.
[00:25:20.472 --> 00:25:21.393]  It's a formula.
[00:25:21.773 --> 00:25:22.533]  It's a plan.
[00:25:22.914 --> 00:25:24.895]  You've seen everything I say come true so far.
[00:25:25.335 --> 00:25:27.016]  Stop denying the evidence.
[00:25:27.477 --> 00:25:29.758]  Stop denying the reality before it's too late.
[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:36.703]  Let's go to this incredible video that again is posted at InfoWars.com.
[00:25:38.328 --> 00:25:45.531]  And NewsWars.com, that is so incredibly bombshell, where they're like, look how quiet it is.
[00:25:45.651 --> 00:25:46.952]  No one's out now.
[00:25:47.372 --> 00:25:49.533]  Yes, all the farms are closed.
[00:25:49.973 --> 00:25:51.554]  Ah, no food's being brought.
[00:25:51.694 --> 00:25:52.934]  Ah, so liberal.
[00:25:53.155 --> 00:25:54.575]  Oh, I'm Klaus Schwab.
[00:25:55.055 --> 00:25:58.037]  My grandfather ran Hitler's atomic weapon program.
[00:25:58.637 --> 00:25:59.457]  You think you'll beat us?
[00:25:59.877 --> 00:26:00.718]  We are now liberal.
[00:26:01.238 --> 00:26:02.058]  I am Klaus Schwab.
[00:26:03.419 --> 00:26:04.179]  Starved to death.
[00:26:04.219 --> 00:26:05.900]  The left's like, I hate America.
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:06.680]  I hate myself.
[00:26:06.821 --> 00:26:07.661]  I want to starve to death.
[00:26:09.261 --> 00:26:10.982]  The article's on InfoWars.com.
[00:26:11.042 --> 00:26:15.324]  I hope you watch the video for yourself, and I hope you share it, because that's your real power.
[00:26:15.845 --> 00:26:17.986]  Just being awake is only one-third of the equation.
[00:26:18.026 --> 00:26:21.087]  The two-thirds is researching it and then sharing it.
[00:26:21.768 --> 00:26:22.528]  Don't just share.
[00:26:22.788 --> 00:26:23.549]  Don't trust me.
[00:26:23.909 --> 00:26:24.629]  Critically think.
[00:26:24.969 --> 00:26:25.790]  Check what I'm saying.
[00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:28.811]  Don't listen to the New York Times when they say, do not question.
[00:26:29.312 --> 00:26:30.592]  Do whatever the New York Times says.
[00:26:31.093 --> 00:26:31.273]  No.
[00:26:31.633 --> 00:26:32.393]  Don't believe me.
[00:26:32.794 --> 00:26:33.774]  Don't believe the New York Times.
[00:26:34.214 --> 00:26:34.995]  Research it yourself.
[00:26:38.437 --> 00:26:39.157]  So, here it is.
[00:26:39.698 --> 00:26:45.622]  Ambient noise in some cities fell 50% and the death toll of starvation doubled.
[00:26:46.664 --> 00:26:47.844]  You're like, well, that's dystopic.
[00:26:47.904 --> 00:26:51.186]  Drink sewage, eat cockroaches.
[00:26:51.546 --> 00:26:52.106]  What is this?
[00:26:52.146 --> 00:26:53.827]  They're like, it is liberal.
[00:26:55.107 --> 00:27:00.849]  You let us send pedophiles to your school to teach your sons to chop their penis off.
[00:27:01.289 --> 00:27:02.070]  It is liberal.
[00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:04.710]  I mean, you are ready to be destroyed.
[00:27:05.051 --> 00:27:06.011]  You let us do it.
[00:27:09.551 --> 00:27:13.453]  We could not defeat you, we did not get atomic weapons, but we got EU!
[00:27:13.814 --> 00:27:15.014]  And now we get you!
[00:27:15.034 --> 00:27:16.435]  Klaus Schwab!
[00:27:16.915 --> 00:27:17.856]  Heil Hitler!
[00:27:19.597 --> 00:27:24.780]  Because the Rockefellers funded Hitler, and the Rockefellers fund this, and the UN, they're only one extension.
[00:27:25.661 --> 00:27:34.866]  That's why they tell you everybody else is Nazis all day, because folks, the Nazis were born out of this program.
[00:27:38.308 --> 00:27:40.150]  And Klaus Schwab thinks you're too dumb to figure that out.
[00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:51.880]  So, let us go ahead and go to this little promo video that's been pulled by them because people backlashed against it.
[00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:56.404]  It was like, all this stuff they do.
[00:27:56.444 --> 00:28:00.507]  They're just, they're trying to get you to go against your own instincts and accept hell and death.
[00:28:00.728 --> 00:28:01.048]  Here it is.
[00:28:04.966 --> 00:28:06.967]  Earth's seismic noise.
[00:28:07.027 --> 00:28:07.467]  Oh, back it up.
[00:28:07.487 --> 00:28:08.108]  I'm going to start over.
[00:28:08.128 --> 00:28:11.129]  Earth's seismic noise went down.
[00:28:11.469 --> 00:28:12.230]  That's good!
[00:28:12.650 --> 00:28:14.951]  We don't want people doing things that... No!
[00:28:15.312 --> 00:28:16.452]  Go away!
[00:28:16.472 --> 00:28:18.453]  I don't want to hear you!
[00:28:18.593 --> 00:28:19.374]  No!
[00:28:19.794 --> 00:28:20.274]  Start over.
[00:28:20.294 --> 00:28:24.857]  Earth's seismic noise has been lowest in decades due to lockdown.
[00:28:24.877 --> 00:28:25.377]  Start over.
[00:28:28.732 --> 00:28:29.272]  Hey, pause again.
[00:28:29.493 --> 00:28:32.214]  And that's a little NPR, like, dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum.
[00:28:32.795 --> 00:28:40.500]  Oh, it's a man in German accent, talking to me real slow, like you starving and gooood.
[00:28:41.281 --> 00:28:44.663]  But you must open your border to third world because you racist.
[00:28:45.003 --> 00:28:46.665]  Here, let me wear Klingon outfit.
[00:28:47.045 --> 00:28:47.965]  Here, start the video over.
[00:28:48.025 --> 00:28:48.506]  I'm gonna be quiet.
[00:28:54.343 --> 00:28:55.523]  Look how nice this is.
[00:28:56.224 --> 00:28:59.065]  Scientists saw a wave of quiet around the world.
[00:29:00.165 --> 00:29:01.906]  Ambient noise in some cities fell 50%.
[00:29:03.707 --> 00:29:06.127]  A fewer people used transport, good for Earth.
[00:29:07.208 --> 00:29:08.348]  And factories closed.
[00:29:09.369 --> 00:29:09.529]  Ah!
[00:29:10.529 --> 00:29:17.892]  The quiet enabled scientists to record small earthquakes they usually miss and improve their understanding of seismic activity.
[00:29:19.224 --> 00:29:21.766]  So they can predict larger earthquakes in the future.
[00:29:21.786 --> 00:29:25.629]  Ah, they're also record falls in air pollution.
[00:29:25.769 --> 00:29:26.309]  Oh, good!
[00:29:26.649 --> 00:29:29.231]  Cleaning skies for Asia to America.
[00:29:30.272 --> 00:29:33.534]  But by late 2020, air had returned to pre-pandemic levels.
[00:29:34.355 --> 00:29:37.077]  Carbon emissions also down 7% last year.
[00:29:37.897 --> 00:29:42.020]  But the drop wouldn't slow climate change unless we locked down emissions.
[00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:44.502]  How quiet was your local area?
[00:29:44.522 --> 00:29:47.043]  Oh, we'd like a comment!
[00:29:47.504 --> 00:29:47.564]  Oh!
[00:29:50.981 --> 00:29:55.323]  And he's on video saying, any profession where you're in contact with humans, it's over.
[00:29:56.924 --> 00:30:00.165]  Wear a mask, you dirty, filthy Americans.
[00:30:00.906 --> 00:30:05.448]  I mean, this is literally our country being conquered by dudes in Klingon outfits.
[00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:11.251]  We have a guest joining us.
[00:30:11.471 --> 00:30:12.171]  I had his bio.
[00:30:12.251 --> 00:30:13.012]  You guys give me his bio.
[00:30:13.032 --> 00:30:13.572]  I can't find it.
[00:30:14.132 --> 00:30:14.632]  Chris Sky.
[00:30:14.652 --> 00:30:16.693]  I want to plug his website, so I'll arrest him.
[00:30:16.733 --> 00:30:16.974]  Thanks.
[00:30:18.774 --> 00:30:19.555]  He's coming up.
[00:30:20.896 --> 00:30:33.349]  We had a whistleblower, and I understand why he chickened out, because he knew he was talking about how these big pharma companies get their own clean vaccine, and what it does to your genetics, it gives you an autoimmune disease.
[00:30:33.709 --> 00:30:36.292]  We already have top scientists saying it, but he was an insider saying it.
[00:30:36.732 --> 00:30:38.034]  He got scared and didn't come on.
[00:30:42.165 --> 00:30:45.847]  Changed his voice from his interview Friday as he wanted.
[00:30:46.468 --> 00:30:51.471]  And we're about to air that short interview we did with him right now.
[00:30:52.592 --> 00:30:57.715]  And then Chris Sky is going to be joining us on the other side.
[00:30:57.775 --> 00:30:59.576]  So here's the headline.
[00:30:59.596 --> 00:31:00.337]  I hope you share it.
[00:31:00.357 --> 00:31:01.337]  I hope you don't just watch it.
[00:31:02.458 --> 00:31:07.622]  But Big Pharma whistleblower exposes mRNA vaccines banned dot video.
[00:31:08.182 --> 00:31:09.323]  We're going to go to this report.
[00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:11.300]  There it is at Bandot Video.
[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:14.541]  Big Pharma Whistleblower reveals dangers of mRNA vaccine.
[00:31:14.561 --> 00:31:18.823]  And we'll be right back on the other side with Chris Sky, InfoWars.com.
[00:31:18.863 --> 00:31:19.983]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:31:25.064 --> 00:31:36.828]  People are going to swell up like balloons, you know, with these, with the additives that they're putting in the thing, sugar, sodium chloride, because it's being dosed in such a way that
[00:31:37.875 --> 00:31:46.781]  The actual serum that the vaccine's in, it doesn't contain, it contains less ingredients, but more concentration of the ones they're putting in.
[00:31:47.161 --> 00:31:54.025]  The salt, the vinegar, if you eat some salt and vinegar chips, you're going to start getting all kinds of digestive problems.
[00:31:54.045 --> 00:31:55.126]  You're going to swell up.
[00:31:55.146 --> 00:31:59.448]  You're going to notice your face starts to get, you know, some people are allergic to beer and stuff.
[00:31:59.669 --> 00:32:01.950]  You're going to, all these allergies are going to start to pop up.
[00:32:02.771 --> 00:32:05.313]  And you're going to see it in the next 10 years, or even sooner.
[00:32:05.373 --> 00:32:06.314]  It's going to start to happen.
[00:32:06.494 --> 00:32:09.857]  Your body's going to start having an autoimmune response to these common things.
[00:32:09.877 --> 00:32:11.738]  It's going to become allergic to itself.
[00:32:13.139 --> 00:32:14.800]  So yeah, it's autoimmune.
[00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:16.562]  Your body becomes allergic to itself.
[00:32:16.962 --> 00:32:19.364]  Charles G's got his neck in the Moderna.
[00:32:20.044 --> 00:32:20.325]  All of it.
[00:32:20.365 --> 00:32:21.766]  I mean, he's making big money.
[00:32:21.806 --> 00:32:23.187]  This is a big money operation.
[00:32:33.032 --> 00:32:36.613]  The people of America, the people of the world, are taking their power back.
[00:32:36.973 --> 00:32:45.055]  And one way of doing it is locking up your cell phone when you're not using it so it's not tracking your location for contact tracers, the UN, the globalists, and hackers.
[00:32:45.456 --> 00:32:50.797]  And normally we sell out of these at $19.95, but we're selling them at $14.95 right now.
[00:32:51.057 --> 00:32:52.378]  That's 50% off retail.
[00:32:52.738 --> 00:32:56.979]  Get these privacy pockets today at InfoWarsTore.com while you still can.
[00:32:57.419 --> 00:32:58.160]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[00:32:58.380 --> 00:32:58.600]  Good, good.
[00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:01.321]  Hey, I wanted to touch on a couple things here.
[00:33:01.422 --> 00:33:03.463]  I know you said that Theranos, that's the
[00:33:21.747 --> 00:33:26.214]  That's what dissolves these people, but I'd say Jesus Christ.
[00:33:26.314 --> 00:33:27.395]  I'd one up you on that.
[00:33:28.297 --> 00:33:31.621]  And I think, you know, you've got to call it Jesus Christ, man.
[00:33:31.661 --> 00:33:33.424]  These people, they shake in their boots.
[00:33:34.589 --> 00:33:38.312]  Well, I want to be a million, trillion, quadrillion, infinity clear.
[00:33:38.613 --> 00:33:40.134]  Jesus Christ is the only answer.
[00:33:40.634 --> 00:33:50.462]  I was saying, politically, Theranos, the fraud computer PCR test system, basically, that said it could detect cancer and all these other diseases, was a fraud.
[00:33:50.883 --> 00:33:52.504]  The current PCR test is a fraud.
[00:33:52.544 --> 00:33:54.786]  The inventor said it's a fraud for this.
[00:33:55.346 --> 00:33:57.788]  And so the whole basis of this thing is a fraud.
[00:33:58.329 --> 00:33:59.370]  We need to point that out.
[00:34:01.034 --> 00:34:01.975]  We're being played here.
[00:34:02.795 --> 00:34:05.877]  You should get Scott Jensen on your show, Dr. Scott Jensen.
[00:34:06.597 --> 00:34:11.640]  He's a very humble doctor, but he's been following this the whole time, and he's a very well-spoken man.
[00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:14.781]  You should look into him, but there's a couple things I wanted to mention about the vaccines.
[00:34:14.801 --> 00:34:19.203]  I actually work in vaccine research at one of the big companies.
[00:34:19.283 --> 00:34:24.526]  I'm not going to mention who, but it's one of the big ones, and something you guys need to look at.
[00:34:24.946 --> 00:34:27.007]  Go look at the ingredient list.
[00:34:27.668 --> 00:34:28.988]  Most vaccines normally have 40
[00:34:30.453 --> 00:34:32.695]  Or more ingredients, and they're all toxic.
[00:34:33.495 --> 00:34:49.066]  These mRNA vaccines only contain maybe 10, but you have to look at five of the ingredients, five or six, are some of the most commonly consumed things in human nature, and I'll list them off.
[00:34:49.447 --> 00:34:58.413]  Acetic acid, vinegar, sodium chloride salt, table salt, and sugar, and then there's two or three commonly used preservatives.
[00:34:59.457 --> 00:35:19.184]  I mean they are literally putting, I'm telling you, they're literally putting in the most common things you could think of because they want people to develop immune reaction and it might not be initially but it's going to happen over time where the body's going to end up going into developing Crohn's disease and all these different future allergies.
[00:35:19.364 --> 00:35:21.445]  Yeah, what you just said is super, super important.
[00:35:21.466 --> 00:35:24.447]  So spend a few minutes here, because you work in vaccine development.
[00:35:24.528 --> 00:35:25.388]  I don't just believe you.
[00:35:25.408 --> 00:35:26.289]  I know what you're saying is true.
[00:35:26.609 --> 00:35:28.450]  I've read a bunch of scientific papers about the mRNA.
[00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:30.452]  People are like, oh, this has less ingredients.
[00:35:30.492 --> 00:35:47.443]  But when that stuff is mixed with this protein that your body is going to learn an immunity to at the cellular level, statistically, large portions of people will start developing autoimmune responses to these common things that are already in the body, like the protein that it's teaching you to have a response to.
[00:35:47.483 --> 00:35:48.844]  So explain that to people.
[00:35:50.484 --> 00:35:58.785]  Right, so it's very complicated, but particularly with the mRNA vaccines, what we have to look at is the spike protein that's being encoded.
[00:35:59.366 --> 00:36:08.167]  It is just a small snippet of one of the proteins that this virus makes, but it has epitopes, like syncytin-1, which you know about.
[00:36:08.747 --> 00:36:14.948]  It's a protein found in literally almost all of our cells, but particularly in the placenta.
[00:36:15.748 --> 00:36:18.549]  And this protein, there's papers, research on this,
[00:36:19.614 --> 00:36:35.164]  And this comes full circle back to last February when that Indian University first published the genome, they sequenced the genome of this virus, and they found GP41, glycoprotein 41, and glycoprotein 120 in this virus.
[00:36:35.764 --> 00:36:40.027]  Now these are surface proteins that help bind and help the virus recognize itself.
[00:36:40.568 --> 00:36:41.748]  These proteins were found.
[00:36:41.828 --> 00:36:44.690]  They're the two most important proteins in HIV.
[00:36:45.551 --> 00:36:48.733]  And so this is confirmation, again, they confirmed that this is
[00:36:49.591 --> 00:36:55.132]  Uncanny, this is unlikely to happen in nature, and it's a hallmark of gain-of-function research.
[00:36:55.793 --> 00:37:05.215]  But, since it's in one, it's homologous to, it shares almost identical sequence with GP41 and GP120.
[00:37:05.735 --> 00:37:16.338]  And so, when you see people getting with the AstraZeneca vaccine, for instance, which shares many similarities with the mRNA sequence that's being used in mRNA vaccine, when you're seeing people
[00:37:17.481 --> 00:37:18.662]  I'm good to go.
[00:37:47.492 --> 00:37:48.092]  Two more things.
[00:37:48.532 --> 00:37:53.874]  I have inside knowledge because, like I said, I work for one of the big boys in vaccine research.
[00:37:53.894 --> 00:38:02.596]  Pfizer, I have... Pfizer's not giving the same vaccine to its employees that it's giving to the population, and I have that on record.
[00:38:03.836 --> 00:38:04.216]  Firstly.
[00:38:04.656 --> 00:38:16.699]  Secondly is Pfizer just announced that this new drug just got approved by FDA for, you're not going to believe this, deambirazine, which is one of the symptoms that we're seeing
[00:38:17.378 --> 00:38:18.039]  We're good to go.
[00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:37.801]  Oh, by approving another drug, a treatment for Guillain-Barre.
[00:38:53.466 --> 00:38:56.849]  Uh, this EU Advisory Commission said it's all there.
[00:38:57.329 --> 00:39:00.632]  How do they think they're going to get away with something on this scale?
[00:39:00.712 --> 00:39:01.693]  I'll ask you that too.
[00:39:02.213 --> 00:39:03.815]  It's a real honor to be here live with you.
[00:39:03.915 --> 00:39:04.755]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:39:05.816 --> 00:39:10.020]  I'll check him out as a whistleblower and it'll come on, have him on as a guest because he is a whistleblower.
[00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:12.642]  And when he's saying tracks, did you just hear him earlier?
[00:39:13.543 --> 00:39:17.766]  He works for a big vaccine maker, one of the big ones.
[00:39:18.767 --> 00:39:22.370]  And he was, he was breaking down all the issues, all the problems and how
[00:39:23.669 --> 00:39:28.814]  This vaccine maker is not giving them the same vaccine the public gets.
[00:39:28.875 --> 00:39:30.937]  Well, you'd have to be informed to know that.
[00:39:30.997 --> 00:39:31.858]  That's actually true.
[00:39:32.358 --> 00:39:44.871]  It came out, oh, 15 years ago and again about 10 years ago, even the Leningradian, that in China, Germany, the UK, and other, quote, nations, there are, quote, clean vaccines that are given
[00:39:46.121 --> 00:39:47.302]  To the elites and rich people.
[00:39:47.842 --> 00:39:51.485]  That was the headline was government elites given clean vaccine.
[00:39:52.286 --> 00:39:53.487]  Click web and see if you can find that.
[00:39:54.208 --> 00:39:55.789]  Rich and powerful given clean vaccine.
[00:39:55.829 --> 00:39:56.990]  That was another headline.
[00:39:57.570 --> 00:39:59.532]  So what he's saying is absolutely true.
[00:40:00.493 --> 00:40:02.234]  And so yeah, vaccines are real technology, folks.
[00:40:02.274 --> 00:40:08.799]  I'm not even against it if you have a cost-benefit analysis and there's something really bad out there and you want to learn, but it's the contaminants.
[00:40:08.899 --> 00:40:10.601]  Nobody had peanut allergies 50 years ago.
[00:40:11.041 --> 00:40:17.566]  They grew some vaccines on peanut protein, and you've got people dying if they eat one little piece of a peanut.
[00:40:17.967 --> 00:40:22.610]  And so now they stopped doing the vaccines on peanuts, so they don't have the problem in people now being born.
[00:40:23.331 --> 00:40:24.252]  So this is a big deal.
[00:40:24.292 --> 00:40:26.974]  That was a major bombshell you dropped.
[00:40:27.755 --> 00:40:29.316]  Tell us as much information as you can.
[00:40:31.553 --> 00:40:32.053]  Yeah, Alex.
[00:40:32.333 --> 00:40:34.514]  So I mean, I can go into more detail.
[00:40:34.914 --> 00:40:40.375]  You're saying you work for a big vaccine maker and they told you, did they tell you that you're getting a vaccine?
[00:40:40.796 --> 00:40:46.437]  Yeah, they told us that I have it on record, but and I can I can, you know, get that used at some point.
[00:40:47.177 --> 00:41:00.821]  But I really want to emphasize, you know, people are going to swell up like like balloons, you know, with these with the additives that they're putting into the sugar, sodium chloride, because it's being ghosted in such a way that
[00:41:01.868 --> 00:41:10.774]  The actual serum that the vaccine's in, it doesn't contain, it contains less ingredients, but more concentration of the ones they're putting in.
[00:41:11.154 --> 00:41:13.336]  The salt, the vinegar.
[00:41:13.356 --> 00:41:18.019]  If you eat some salt and vinegar chips, you're going to start getting all kinds of digestive problems.
[00:41:18.059 --> 00:41:19.119]  You're going to swell up.
[00:41:19.139 --> 00:41:23.422]  You're going to notice your face starts to get, you know, some people are allergic to beer and stuff.
[00:41:23.682 --> 00:41:25.964]  You're going to, all these allergies are going to start to pop up.
[00:41:26.784 --> 00:41:29.285]  And you're going to see it in the next 10 years or even sooner.
[00:41:29.365 --> 00:41:30.326]  It's going to start to happen.
[00:41:30.486 --> 00:41:33.847]  Your body's going to start having an autoimmune response to these common things.
[00:41:33.867 --> 00:41:35.728]  It's going to become allergic to itself.
[00:41:37.129 --> 00:41:38.710]  So yeah, it's autoimmune.
[00:41:38.730 --> 00:41:40.570]  Your body becomes allergic to itself.
[00:41:40.971 --> 00:41:47.694]  There's so many other things that people don't understand in the literature that are just something called cell bystander death.
[00:41:47.714 --> 00:41:49.214]  And this is very common.
[00:41:50.865 --> 00:41:53.367]  It's being understood now in HIV.
[00:41:53.667 --> 00:42:00.292]  And again, we come back to HIV being a... Oh, Fauci's got his neck in the Moderna... All of it.
[00:42:00.332 --> 00:42:01.753]  I mean, he's making big money.
[00:42:01.793 --> 00:42:03.194]  This is a big money operation.
[00:42:03.274 --> 00:42:20.326]  And there's some things I could reveal to you at a later time, but... Another thing you need to understand is... Well, we can go into that later, but... I want you guys to take a look at, type in Google, uh, Columbia Vaccine... Columbia University Vaccine Symposium that just went on this week.
[00:42:21.511 --> 00:42:26.892]  And it was kind of an invite-only thing that you had to be kind of in the vaccine industry to kind of get invited.
[00:42:27.492 --> 00:42:28.813]  But the videos are now public.
[00:42:28.833 --> 00:42:29.713]  They're about two hours.
[00:42:29.733 --> 00:42:31.853]  It started this Monday and it ended today.
[00:42:32.313 --> 00:42:33.914]  Yesterday, Anthony Fauci spoke.
[00:42:34.274 --> 00:42:39.095]  They've had the World Health Organization representatives speaking, World Bank, World Economic Forum.
[00:42:39.795 --> 00:42:45.576]  And it's basically this symposium this week, trying to brainstorm and discuss ways in which
[00:42:46.494 --> 00:43:11.583]  This COVAX program, which is the UN, WHO's sort of program to get the vaccines to the... What people need to understand is what they really want is, yes, they want the first world to get vaccinated and cause us problems, but what they really want is they want, because they want the third world to get vaccinated, because these people, they're not as informed as us.
[00:43:12.183 --> 00:43:15.144]  Their immune systems are less, they're much weaker.
[00:43:19.881 --> 00:43:27.332]  Bill Gates was on Japanese TV a year ago and they said, we hear that you're putting steroids, and he goes, he knows how smart Japanese are, he goes,
[00:43:28.450 --> 00:43:30.552]  We're going to give you a different vaccine in the third world.
[00:43:30.892 --> 00:43:31.393]  He said that.
[00:43:31.453 --> 00:43:33.555]  He said, we're doing different ones for different countries.
[00:43:33.575 --> 00:43:34.696]  The Japanese went, oh, OK.
[00:43:34.936 --> 00:43:38.639]  Because they're all, you know, Japanese are very polite, very nice, but they're all about who's got the power.
[00:43:39.039 --> 00:43:39.900]  And they are not stupid.
[00:43:40.521 --> 00:43:43.143]  And they're all into secret experimentation, the same class thing.
[00:43:43.723 --> 00:43:48.307]  And so the Japanese, I mean, he just told him, he said, don't worry, we're not giving you that.
[00:43:49.088 --> 00:43:49.829]  Can you believe that?
[00:43:49.849 --> 00:43:50.749]  I mean, that is sick.
[00:43:50.890 --> 00:43:54.432]  They're giving the Africans and the Latin Americans really nasty stuff.
[00:43:54.452 --> 00:43:56.754]  People are like, well, Jones, aren't you worried about all the Africans coming here?
[00:43:57.235 --> 00:44:00.778]  I don't want them brought here as weapons against me and brainwashed, but I want to kill them.
[00:44:01.098 --> 00:44:02.359]  That's bad mojo, man.
[00:44:02.379 --> 00:44:05.021]  I want to build up Africa and build up everybody.
[00:44:05.401 --> 00:44:07.083]  So yeah, we got to do something about this, brother.
[00:44:07.912 --> 00:44:11.653]  Well, look into, you need, so day four, go look, have your crew look it up.
[00:44:11.673 --> 00:44:16.395]  But on day four, Anthony Fauci speaks and kind of gives like an overview of the types of vaccines.
[00:44:16.555 --> 00:44:18.875]  I'm coming in tomorrow to do a full day of work.
[00:44:19.576 --> 00:44:23.197]  And, and I'm going to do either a live show or a tape show at about one o'clock.
[00:44:23.237 --> 00:44:23.997]  I haven't decided yet.
[00:44:24.017 --> 00:44:28.879]  If it's a tape show, we'll tape at one and then add a bunch of videos and articles and air at like six at night.
[00:44:29.319 --> 00:44:30.919]  But a lot of times we go live now on Saturdays.
[00:44:31.779 --> 00:44:34.520]  Will you, will you come on commercial free?
[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:36.341]  You can talk like, you can send us exhibits.
[00:44:37.825 --> 00:44:38.486]  You want to show?
[00:44:38.566 --> 00:44:39.326]  What symposiums?
[00:44:39.346 --> 00:44:39.907]  What videos?
[00:44:40.668 --> 00:44:43.050]  I'll have Rob Dew call you, because he's obsessed with this.
[00:44:43.150 --> 00:44:43.770]  He's a good guy.
[00:44:45.372 --> 00:44:48.154]  He'll work 40 hours straight if he gets in this vaccine thing.
[00:44:48.174 --> 00:44:48.995]  He's on a quest.
[00:44:49.495 --> 00:44:50.556]  I'll get you on the phone with Rob Dew.
[00:44:50.576 --> 00:44:51.918]  You can send all your exhibits to him.
[00:44:52.498 --> 00:44:53.239]  I will come up here.
[00:44:53.299 --> 00:44:57.242]  We'll have them all ready, and we'll either go live or tape an hour with you tomorrow.
[00:44:57.302 --> 00:44:57.743]  You want to do that?
[00:44:58.823 --> 00:44:59.063]  Yeah, sure.
[00:44:59.083 --> 00:44:59.824]  Sounds good.
[00:45:24.175 --> 00:45:26.577]  And let's just tape it, because I want to add all the documents and all the videos.
[00:45:26.597 --> 00:45:27.677]  So we'll start taping at 1.
[00:45:27.718 --> 00:45:28.658]  We'll probably go two hours.
[00:45:29.579 --> 00:45:33.221]  And then we'll tape to air.
[00:45:33.982 --> 00:45:35.443]  It's like it's live, but it's not.
[00:45:36.083 --> 00:45:37.164]  We'll tape it like it's live.
[00:45:37.845 --> 00:45:38.845]  Any mistakes, we can fix it.
[00:45:39.346 --> 00:45:41.407]  We'll air it at 5 o'clock tomorrow, folks.
[00:45:42.088 --> 00:45:45.170]  And you'll hear from this man, and he'll send us his exhibits and things he wants us to see.
[00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:47.331]  So give him a Rob Do as soon as Rob gets back.
[00:45:47.351 --> 00:45:48.052]  I don't know where he is.
[00:45:48.512 --> 00:45:48.953]  And we'll do that.
[00:45:48.993 --> 00:45:49.113]  OK.
[00:46:08.303 --> 00:46:09.084]  InfoWars.
[00:46:09.424 --> 00:46:10.985]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:46:11.005 --> 00:46:23.836]  So, Klaus Schwab paid for a video to be put out over Twitter and Facebook.
[00:46:24.337 --> 00:46:26.038]  Millions of views saying, isn't it great?
[00:46:26.058 --> 00:46:27.059]  People are starving to death.
[00:46:27.579 --> 00:46:27.960]  Isn't it good?
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.001]  All your cities are shut down.
[00:46:29.041 --> 00:46:30.081]  You're so quiet now.
[00:46:30.882 --> 00:46:32.303]  Isn't it good all the planes are shut down?
[00:46:32.323 --> 00:46:33.783]  It's so good for the Earth.
[00:46:34.203 --> 00:46:36.204]  Look how happy the animals are.
[00:46:36.684 --> 00:46:38.665]  We are freeing the Earth of the evil humans.
[00:46:38.785 --> 00:46:42.266]  This is the beginning of the depopulation operation.
[00:46:42.727 --> 00:46:44.227]  You don't need to listen to Alex Jones.
[00:46:44.347 --> 00:46:46.148]  It's out in the open now.
[00:46:46.228 --> 00:46:50.229]  You can pretend that you're part of the power structure and go along with it, but you're a fool!
[00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:56.132]  This is a post-human plan run by off-world entities, if it ever was.
[00:46:56.192 --> 00:46:57.592]  And I don't need to see them or know it.
[00:46:57.692 --> 00:46:59.193]  I can see the attack profile.
[00:46:59.693 --> 00:47:00.373]  And that's what it is.
[00:47:01.333 --> 00:47:02.554]  We had Chris Sky on.
[00:47:03.074 --> 00:47:04.174]  Really impressive individual.
[00:47:04.194 --> 00:47:05.214]  I've seen his videos before.
[00:47:05.814 --> 00:47:11.656]  But he has been getting arrested, you name it, for refusing the ongoing martial law in Canada and leading a rebellion worldwide.
[00:47:11.976 --> 00:47:16.217]  We'll talk to him here in just a moment on this special Saturday emergency transmission.
[00:47:16.597 --> 00:47:19.738]  And realize, if you're a viewer, you're just as important as Chris Sky or myself.
[00:47:20.678 --> 00:47:27.005]  Share the live link at BandopVideo and InfoWars.com and say, hey, people are fighting back against the Great Reset.
[00:47:27.345 --> 00:47:29.067]  They're fighting back against the New World Order.
[00:47:29.367 --> 00:47:30.929]  They're fighting back against the tyranny.
[00:47:31.249 --> 00:47:32.451]  It's a beautiful time to be alive.
[00:47:32.471 --> 00:47:37.876]  We're going to play a clip of him last September predicting where we are now in a moment.
[00:47:37.896 --> 00:47:38.337]  But first!
[00:47:39.875 --> 00:47:41.796]  I'm not funded by Klaus Schwab or Bill Gates.
[00:47:41.836 --> 00:47:42.636]  I'm funded by you.
[00:47:43.216 --> 00:47:49.838]  And I've got great t-shirts, great water filtration, great air filtration, great supplements, great everything at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:47:49.878 --> 00:47:51.499]  And we're doing the biggest sale of the year yet.

[00:47:57.860 --> 00:47:59.821]  And a lot of the cost of food is the shipping.
[00:48:00.401 --> 00:48:03.362]  High quality food, the best you're going to get for anywhere near this price.
[00:48:04.122 --> 00:48:05.583]  But the regular sales prices,
[00:48:06.693 --> 00:48:07.774]  Right now, this is insane.
[00:48:08.094 --> 00:48:10.255]  Only five days left that we can do this.

[00:49:01.414 --> 00:49:02.776]  Leading competition isn't as good.
[00:49:02.956 --> 00:49:04.058]  Retails for $400.
[00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:05.541]  Boom!
[00:49:05.901 --> 00:49:06.663]  These are the best deals.
[00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:10.901]  I always pat myself on the back like, we have incredible sales numbers.
[00:49:10.921 --> 00:49:12.061]  We got millions of dollars coming in.
[00:49:12.642 --> 00:49:15.162]  Uh, yeah, but out of a million bucks, you get a hundred thousand to fund yourself.
[00:49:15.182 --> 00:49:17.823]  It doesn't, we got to sell a lot of product.
[00:49:18.204 --> 00:49:21.845]  That's my model to have good prices, but I don't jack up the retail.
[00:49:21.865 --> 00:49:22.965]  So I need your support.
[00:49:23.465 --> 00:49:25.226]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:49:28.612 --> 00:49:35.734]  All right, since he was on three days ago and the interview went viral, Chris Sky has a lot more to talk about.
[00:49:35.794 --> 00:49:39.575]  He's on home arrest, house arrest for his thought crimes.
[00:49:39.675 --> 00:49:41.396]  Others have been allowed out because he protests.
[00:49:41.436 --> 00:49:45.557]  He's locked in his house, facing real prison time if he leaves, but he's fighting through
[00:49:46.397 --> 00:49:48.138]  Cyber system while he still can.
[00:49:48.178 --> 00:49:51.259]  That's why every day is so serious affected the battle space.
[00:49:51.359 --> 00:49:52.879]  We know it's going to get so bad in the future.
[00:49:53.139 --> 00:49:54.239]  You're going to rise up, folks.
[00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:58.761]  The question is, will the enemy have their control systems in place by then when you do rise up?
[00:49:59.261 --> 00:50:03.722]  So it's a battle to get you activated and awake before things get so bad and you're forced to take action.
[00:50:04.443 --> 00:50:06.783]  You want to win this without it getting really bloody.
[00:50:07.463 --> 00:50:11.945]  But whatever happens, we cannot submit, obviously, to this dehumanization takeover.
[00:50:12.725 --> 00:50:14.526]  But here he is back in September of last year.
[00:50:14.966 --> 00:50:16.387]  He'd just come back from Ireland.
[00:50:16.407 --> 00:50:17.747]  He'd just warned them of what was coming.
[00:50:18.108 --> 00:50:22.530]  He had just been detained, told he'd be arrested if he wouldn't spoke in public, but he did.
[00:50:22.550 --> 00:50:26.211]  And this video has hundreds of millions of views worldwide in all the major languages.
[00:50:26.512 --> 00:50:27.412]  It's huge in India.
[00:50:27.812 --> 00:50:28.733]  It's huge in Russia.
[00:50:29.013 --> 00:50:30.674]  The US military is refusing the shot.
[00:50:30.994 --> 00:50:32.214]  The Indians are refusing the shot.
[00:50:32.274 --> 00:50:33.275]  Switzerland just banned.
[00:50:33.935 --> 00:50:35.679]  Uh, the, uh, AstraZeneca.
[00:50:35.939 --> 00:50:37.943]  There's huge victories happening.
[00:50:37.963 --> 00:50:40.027]  You won't see it on the news, but it's happening.
[00:50:40.047 --> 00:50:44.835]  We'll talk about that in a moment, but here is Chris Sky laying it out back in September.
[00:50:46.052 --> 00:50:46.852]  You don't need a mask.
[00:50:46.892 --> 00:50:48.313]  The mask is about compliance.
[00:50:48.333 --> 00:50:50.633]  Because they know Canadians like to do what they're told.
[00:50:50.913 --> 00:50:54.574]  So if they tell you you have to wear a mask, next they're going to tell you you have to contact trace.
[00:50:54.955 --> 00:50:56.915]  Then they're going to tell you you have to take the vaccine.
[00:50:57.215 --> 00:51:00.736]  And because Canadians like to do what they're told, they're hoping that everyone just complies.
[00:51:01.016 --> 00:51:02.057]  And then guess what, kids?
[00:51:02.437 --> 00:51:06.198]  Once you take your vaccine, like a dumb person that doesn't know any better,
[00:51:06.738 --> 00:51:18.428]  They're gonna tell you, sorry, the vaccine isn't as effective as we thought it was gonna be, so now you still gotta wear your mask, still gotta get contact trace, still have all the restrictions and social distancing, and still take your vaccine.
[00:51:18.708 --> 00:51:20.109]  And then what did you get out of all of this?
[00:51:20.489 --> 00:51:27.715]  You got a whole year where you weren't allowed to travel, your business was closed, they took your rights and freedoms, they forced the vaccine on you, and...
[00:51:28.476 --> 00:51:28.976]  What happened?
[00:51:29.297 --> 00:51:38.683]  The same amount of people died, everything is the exact same, and now they're gonna put you back on lockdown and bring it all the way till July of next year so they can do the same thing again!
[00:51:39.043 --> 00:51:44.767]  Bring you from July, August, and September, getting you off lockdown, but just to bring you back on lockdown again.
[00:51:45.207 --> 00:51:46.688]  You idiots haven't figured it out yet?
[00:51:47.108 --> 00:51:50.031]  It's a perpetual cycle that you never get out of.
[00:51:50.311 --> 00:51:54.975]  And it's a way to take your rights, your freedoms, close your business, take your wealth.
[00:51:55.255 --> 00:51:55.555]  Why?
[00:51:55.635 --> 00:51:57.237]  So you become dependent on government.
[00:51:57.617 --> 00:51:57.937]  Why?
[00:51:57.957 --> 00:52:01.360]  If you're independent, the government works for you like it's supposed to.
[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:10.688]  If you depend on the government to give you a paycheck to feed your family every month, because they closed your business on you, now the government doesn't work for you, the government rules you.
[00:52:11.068 --> 00:52:13.150]  So instead of a middle class, we have
[00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:18.833]  The government, upper class, and the lower class dependents that rely on the government to survive.
[00:52:19.133 --> 00:52:21.054]  In other words, we have a slave class.
[00:52:21.575 --> 00:52:22.535]  And that's what they're trying to do.
[00:52:22.595 --> 00:52:23.216]  It's that simple.
[00:52:23.616 --> 00:52:24.476]  Alright, thanks a lot Chris.
[00:52:36.767 --> 00:52:39.309]  And that's human intelligence that globalists are so scared of.
[00:52:39.869 --> 00:52:43.852]  And you nailed it then saying, once you take the vaccine, they'll say it doesn't work.
[00:52:44.212 --> 00:52:47.034]  You can't still go out, still got to wear a mask, still have social distance.
[00:52:47.394 --> 00:52:50.256]  Fauci just announced that last Tuesday.
[00:52:50.696 --> 00:52:52.678]  So we can talk about where we are now.
[00:52:53.998 --> 00:53:00.703]  But let's talk about where we're going next, because you already predicted Chris Sky, where we were going off their own UN documents.
[00:53:01.743 --> 00:53:03.585]  But let's talk about where they're going next.
[00:53:03.625 --> 00:53:05.486]  But it's great to have you here, my friend.
[00:53:06.323 --> 00:53:06.663]  Thank you.
[00:53:06.703 --> 00:53:07.944]  It's always great to be here.
[00:53:08.025 --> 00:53:10.006]  Like I said, I've been a fan of you forever.
[00:53:10.086 --> 00:53:11.888]  I just want to give a plug to Andrew Says.
[00:53:11.928 --> 00:53:13.970]  He's the man that made that video with me.
[00:53:14.010 --> 00:53:15.071]  He was holding the mic for me.
[00:53:15.111 --> 00:53:15.912]  He's with Rebel News.
[00:53:15.932 --> 00:53:16.512]  They're great.
[00:53:16.793 --> 00:53:19.615]  If it wasn't for them, my message wouldn't be getting out like it's been getting.
[00:53:20.116 --> 00:53:22.097]  Oh, Rebel News is completely badass.
[00:53:22.918 --> 00:53:23.479]  Yeah, they are.
[00:53:23.599 --> 00:53:25.541]  In Canada, they're the MVP, aren't they?
[00:53:26.401 --> 00:53:27.062]  Yes, for sure.
[00:53:27.102 --> 00:53:29.124]  They're the only ones that'll report on anything that
[00:53:29.585 --> 00:53:32.087]  The mainstream media doesn't want them to report on.
[00:53:32.767 --> 00:53:34.609]  And their reporter, David Menzies, is amazing.
[00:53:34.649 --> 00:53:36.210]  We salute Rebel Media!
[00:53:36.450 --> 00:53:36.951]  Salute!
[00:53:37.231 --> 00:53:37.711]  Salute!
[00:53:37.851 --> 00:53:38.292]  Salute!
[00:53:42.835 --> 00:53:44.517]  And by the way, I'm not always in a tank top.
[00:53:44.537 --> 00:53:47.639]  They gave me about 20 minutes for that interview in the studio.
[00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:48.620]  Notice.
[00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:49.280]  Whatever, dude.
[00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:51.782]  If you're in good shape like that, might as well flaunt it.
[00:53:52.142 --> 00:53:53.764]  I'm sure you're not missing out with the ladies.
[00:53:54.830 --> 00:53:56.052]  No, I guess not.
[00:53:56.312 --> 00:53:56.913]  Definitely not.
[00:53:56.933 --> 00:53:57.834]  All right, so let's get back into it.
[00:53:58.394 --> 00:53:59.496]  So where are they going from here?
[00:53:59.756 --> 00:54:00.397]  It's obvious.
[00:54:00.497 --> 00:54:03.220]  The next step is the vaccine passport.
[00:54:03.741 --> 00:54:04.562]  That's what they want.
[00:54:04.702 --> 00:54:06.805]  They want to have this so-called vaccine passport.
[00:54:06.825 --> 00:54:07.646]  That's what they're going to call it.
[00:54:08.146 --> 00:54:13.873]  So for you, you think it has to do with world travel, and then it kind of makes sense to the normal person.
[00:54:13.913 --> 00:54:14.314]  Like, oh,
[00:54:14.707 --> 00:54:15.867]  Well, we have this pandemic.
[00:54:16.107 --> 00:54:17.848]  Maybe if we get this passport, we won't have to do all this.
[00:54:17.868 --> 00:54:19.769]  But now it's to get into the White House Press Corps!
[00:54:20.089 --> 00:54:20.749]  Did you see that?
[00:54:20.769 --> 00:54:21.129]  Yes.
[00:54:21.589 --> 00:54:22.829]  Yes, I did actually.
[00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:24.730]  So they want to do that.
[00:54:24.750 --> 00:54:37.834]  That's why they're doing these crazy travel restrictions with the forced testing and the government mandated hotel quarantine, because they want to make it so ridiculous that when they give you the idea of a vaccine passport that otherwise should frighten you to the very core,
[00:54:38.214 --> 00:54:41.796]  That it actually excites you and you want it so you won't have to go through these measures.
[00:54:41.816 --> 00:54:43.837]  Yeah, because the average person wants to get out of it.
[00:54:44.057 --> 00:54:45.138]  They want to navigate it.
[00:54:45.158 --> 00:54:46.618]  They want to adapt to overcome it.
[00:54:46.819 --> 00:54:48.660]  Instead you're adapting and submitting to it.
[00:54:48.700 --> 00:54:49.120]  Explain that.
[00:54:49.992 --> 00:54:50.513]  Exactly.
[00:54:50.813 --> 00:54:53.415]  So they put you in between a rock and a hard place.
[00:54:53.495 --> 00:55:01.481]  Their real agenda is to try to make you take a forced vaccination that not only apply to travel, it will apply to you being able to go to like a hockey or basketball game.
[00:55:01.541 --> 00:55:04.383]  And again, they see us like a bunch of feral cats they got to sterilize.
[00:55:04.784 --> 00:55:06.965]  That's why the press secretary is like, well, I sterilize cats.
[00:55:07.045 --> 00:55:07.686]  I'm a cat lady.
[00:55:07.766 --> 00:55:08.987]  I mean, we just sterilize.
[00:55:09.007 --> 00:55:11.069]  Well, you sterilize yourself then, you ugly witch.
[00:55:11.369 --> 00:55:12.330]  You first, you pig.
[00:55:13.404 --> 00:55:14.205]  Well, that's what they want to do.
[00:55:14.245 --> 00:55:16.126]  They want to have complete control over everybody.
[00:55:16.186 --> 00:55:21.669]  That ugly pig needs to remove her ovaries and her children's first before she runs her fat, ugly mouth.
[00:55:22.810 --> 00:55:30.635]  Well, if you look at, if you looked at any of the, uh, all the ministers of state, uh, that health ministers all over the United States, they all look like they've been dead for like six years.
[00:55:30.675 --> 00:55:34.258]  Oh yeah, pull up how, how, how, uh, pro COVID health managers.
[00:55:34.278 --> 00:55:35.238]  What's the way to search that?
[00:55:35.378 --> 00:55:36.639]  They got all the memes of it.
[00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:40.502]  Uh, they all look like they're undead corpses.
[00:55:41.479 --> 00:55:42.280]  That's what they all do.
[00:55:42.460 --> 00:55:44.722]  So they're the ones dictating you what you need to do to be healthy.
[00:55:44.762 --> 00:55:46.203]  And what are they telling you to do to be healthy?
[00:55:46.583 --> 00:55:47.164]  Stay home.
[00:55:47.364 --> 00:55:48.284]  Don't exercise.
[00:55:48.605 --> 00:55:49.505]  Don't socialize.
[00:55:49.565 --> 00:55:50.146]  Don't go out.
[00:55:51.167 --> 00:55:52.248]  Go to the liquor store.
[00:55:52.588 --> 00:55:53.649]  Order marijuana.
[00:55:54.669 --> 00:55:55.550]  Order drive-thru.
[00:55:55.570 --> 00:56:01.094]  And whatever you do, don't go out and socialize or exercise or get vitamin D or any of that.
[00:56:01.415 --> 00:56:05.398]  They actually released a document in Canada, because people like me, we're telling people
[00:56:05.959 --> 00:56:13.921]  Vitamin D, Vitamin C, Zinc, Magnesium, eat some healthy fruits and vegetables, organic foods, and your mood system will come up and you won't get sick.
[00:56:14.001 --> 00:56:18.362]  Or if you do catch COVID, you'll be one of the 8 out of 10 people that doesn't even get symptoms when they get it.
[00:56:18.843 --> 00:56:24.084]  And when we put that information out, the Government Health Canada, sorry, not Government Health Canada,
[00:56:24.588 --> 00:56:33.312]  Actually issued an official press release that stated you cannot improve your immune system through diet or supplementation.
[00:56:33.752 --> 00:56:34.733]  They literally said that.
[00:56:34.773 --> 00:56:37.514]  They tried to say that vitamin D will not bring up your immune system.
[00:56:38.174 --> 00:56:42.416]  The only reason we have a flu season, or now it's a COVID season because flu doesn't exist.
[00:56:42.817 --> 00:56:44.477]  Oh, there's one of the health ministers right there.
[00:56:45.178 --> 00:56:47.559]  That's the person you're supposed to be listening to to stay healthy, by the way.
[00:56:48.342 --> 00:56:58.645]  But yeah, since every week we have a flu season in Canada, there's another one, it's because almost the entire population is vitamin D deficient in the winter because we don't have any sunshine.
[00:56:59.045 --> 00:57:01.226]  So everybody needs to increase their immune system.
[00:57:01.646 --> 00:57:03.906]  And where we're going from here is this vaccine passport.
[00:57:03.926 --> 00:57:11.048]  Like we said, they want to make a vaccine passport that limits your ability to travel, work, congregate, socialize, et cetera.
[00:57:11.328 --> 00:57:15.530]  So they can get you on that perpetual cycle of taking at least two vaccinations a year.
[00:57:15.830 --> 00:57:16.950]  Let's say that again, at least.
[00:57:17.389 --> 00:57:20.870]  And I'm saying, they already tell you that you have to take two vaccines for the COVID vaccine.
[00:57:21.230 --> 00:57:25.591]  What they're going to tell you next is that the COVID vaccine only has a certain amount of immunity.
[00:57:26.191 --> 00:57:32.012]  In places like Israel, your vaccine passport or so-called immunity passport expires after six months.
[00:57:32.592 --> 00:57:38.014]  So it sets the precedent to let big evil pharma with liability protection put in you what it wants, when it wants.
[00:57:38.354 --> 00:57:39.574]  I mean, this is the end game, brother.
[00:57:40.353 --> 00:57:40.693]  That's it.
[00:57:40.733 --> 00:57:44.136]  And at the bare minimum, you have to take two COVID vaccines every six months.
[00:57:44.376 --> 00:57:49.200]  So under this new mandate, that'll be four COVID vaccines a year for the average person.
[00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:51.242]  And that's what Gates said a year ago they would do.
[00:57:51.262 --> 00:57:51.922]  So it's simple.
[00:57:52.222 --> 00:57:54.224]  We're not letting you out to accept all these shots.
[00:57:54.284 --> 00:57:57.386]  And they're like, actually, now that you're getting them, we still don't open it.
[00:57:57.647 --> 00:57:59.008]  So what do you project they're going to do?
[00:57:59.048 --> 00:58:00.049]  Just endless lockdowns.
[00:58:00.969 --> 00:58:02.771]  Let it off for a while, constrict it back.
[00:58:03.530 --> 00:58:04.630]  That's exactly what they're going to do.
[00:58:04.650 --> 00:58:10.691]  They want to bring you off lockdown, on lockdown, off lockdown, on lockdown, treat you like an animal, train you like a sheep.
[00:58:11.172 --> 00:58:18.173]  Right now, they already started opening up certain parts of Ontario, my province, and after three or four days, they started relocking some of them down again.
[00:58:18.213 --> 00:58:20.994]  They said, sorry, we're pulling the emergency brake.
[00:58:21.274 --> 00:58:26.175]  They're going to use this idea of new variants, and they're going to give the new variants scary sounding names.
[00:58:26.195 --> 00:58:29.695]  Like they gave one in the United States, they call it the devil variant.
[00:58:29.995 --> 00:58:30.996]  So you'll have to be scared.
[00:58:31.016 --> 00:58:32.316]  Oh, the devil variant!
[00:58:32.896 --> 00:58:34.057]  Sadly, because it's called the devil.
[00:58:34.217 --> 00:58:39.199]  And what's sad is so many... I went to high school with a guy that was a UT football player later, a black guy.
[00:58:39.219 --> 00:58:45.402]  I mean, black folks in all this weather and covering up, gotta have three times the sun of a white person.
[00:58:45.762 --> 00:58:49.644]  No one tells black folks why they're always dying anyways, because they live north of the equator.
[00:58:49.684 --> 00:58:51.064]  You gotta get more sun, black folks.
[00:58:51.284 --> 00:58:52.365]  But they won't tell them!
[00:58:53.809 --> 00:58:54.229]  It's true.
[00:58:54.309 --> 00:59:00.174]  That's the number one reason why people are sick right now is that they're not getting their vitamin D and they're not getting their sunshine because it's wintertime.
[00:59:00.254 --> 00:59:03.917]  Well it's also a liberal cultural thing like you're supposed to be a light colored black person.
[00:59:03.937 --> 00:59:04.117]  No.
[00:59:04.517 --> 00:59:06.099]  If you're black you're supposed to have black skin.
[00:59:06.139 --> 00:59:06.899]  It's beautiful skin.
[00:59:07.220 --> 00:59:08.581]  Get sun black people.
[00:59:08.881 --> 00:59:09.601]  Get sun.
[00:59:10.482 --> 00:59:11.583]  I'm even pasty right now.
[00:59:11.603 --> 00:59:12.744]  I'm not supposed to look like this.
[00:59:12.784 --> 00:59:14.665]  You've seen video clips of me nice and tan.
[00:59:14.685 --> 00:59:15.626]  That's what I'm supposed to look like.
[00:59:15.666 --> 00:59:16.727]  I come from the beach in Italy.
[00:59:16.747 --> 00:59:19.069]  This is what I look like in a Canadian winter when I'm
[00:59:19.551 --> 00:59:22.273]  I was harassed and I can't go outside if I wanted to.
[00:59:22.813 --> 00:59:24.955]  Dude, I could be depressed and exhausted.
[00:59:25.015 --> 00:59:26.296]  Two hours in the raging sun.
[00:59:26.336 --> 00:59:27.477]  I feel like King Kong, man.
[00:59:27.777 --> 00:59:28.677]  We're like a plant.
[00:59:28.817 --> 00:59:29.758]  We need that sun.
[00:59:30.459 --> 00:59:31.259]  You need that sun.
[00:59:31.539 --> 00:59:35.322]  And then they use examples of other countries to try to promote our lockdown.
[00:59:35.362 --> 00:59:36.323]  They use New Zealand.
[00:59:36.343 --> 00:59:39.505]  They're like, oh, New Zealand is COVID-free because they had this huge lockdown.
[00:59:39.845 --> 00:59:43.067]  New Zealand's also in the Southern Hemisphere, so they're in their summer months.
[00:59:43.287 --> 00:59:45.529]  They're a tiny, sparsely populated island.
[00:59:45.849 --> 00:59:46.730]  And guess what?
[00:59:47.190 --> 00:59:52.172]  New Zealand got one case of COVID today with a so-called new variant.
[00:59:52.212 --> 00:59:52.712]  So they locked down?
[00:59:52.732 --> 00:59:58.175]  And they locked down all of Auckland, New Zealand, the entire largest city, for one COVID case.
[00:59:58.515 --> 01:00:03.097]  That's why they wanted to do these roaming lockdowns where they put you on lockdown, bring you off, put you on, bring you down.
[01:00:03.317 --> 01:00:06.779]  They're training you so they can literally put you on lockdown whenever they want.
[01:00:06.799 --> 01:00:08.540]  Yeah, they throw it on and off.
[01:00:08.860 --> 01:00:13.242]  On and off, getting rid of the economic collapse coming because of all the devaluation of currencies.
[01:00:13.302 --> 01:00:14.403]  That's the real great reset.
[01:00:14.743 --> 01:00:16.523]  COVID is just the preparation for that.
[01:00:17.404 --> 01:00:17.644]  Yes.
[01:00:17.764 --> 01:00:21.446]  And in Canada, they already admitted that they're going for a digital currency.
[01:00:21.686 --> 01:00:23.707]  They already admitted they want to move away from cash.
[01:00:23.987 --> 01:00:26.648]  And that is any totalitarian government's wet dream.
[01:00:26.888 --> 01:00:33.731]  When they get rid of cash and they have a digital currency, that means every single transaction is monitored, traced, tracked.
[01:00:34.212 --> 01:00:37.121]  Tax and has to be approved by the government.
[01:00:37.342 --> 01:00:39.650]  It opens the door for the social credit system
[01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:48.692]  So when I'm doing a show like this with someone like you, my social credit score drops and it'll probably drop to the point where they'll revoke my vaccine passport and I won't even be able to travel.
[01:00:48.933 --> 01:00:50.513]  That's the world they want to create for us.
[01:00:50.873 --> 01:00:55.855]  And it was supposed to be till 2030, but they're realizing that people are waking up way too fast.
[01:00:56.075 --> 01:00:57.616]  So that's why they're trying to push it hard.
[01:00:57.816 --> 01:01:00.257]  And that's why they came out with these really draconian measures.
[01:01:00.297 --> 01:01:07.360]  Like, Oh, if you travel, we're going to try to throw you in government hotel for two weeks against your will, because they want to scare the living crap out of you.
[01:01:12.142 --> 01:01:12.922]  Let's talk about this.
[01:01:12.962 --> 01:01:13.803]  You're dead on, brother.
[01:01:14.123 --> 01:01:14.943]  So let's talk about this.
[01:01:15.143 --> 01:01:16.124]  Why did they launch it now?
[01:01:16.164 --> 01:01:19.545]  We know Operation Lockstep, Rockefeller Foundation, was on the shelf.
[01:01:19.925 --> 01:01:22.986]  When you leave us, I'll play a clip where I predicted 11 years ago from their own documents.
[01:01:24.487 --> 01:01:26.668]  But they were scared to launch it before.
[01:01:26.708 --> 01:01:30.409]  I think they launched it out of desperation, and I don't think it's going well for them.
[01:01:30.429 --> 01:01:33.911]  And I don't want to be overly positive here, but India's banned.
[01:01:34.946 --> 01:01:37.267]  The Pfizer mRNA vaccine.
[01:01:37.627 --> 01:01:39.328]  South Africa, now Switzerland.
[01:01:40.548 --> 01:01:42.889]  We now have the military, the majority, refusing it.
[01:01:43.429 --> 01:01:48.151]  We now have even more articles here where African countries are refusing it en masse.
[01:01:48.632 --> 01:01:50.012]  So there is major pushback.
[01:01:50.032 --> 01:01:51.533]  You're just not going to see it on U.S.
[01:01:51.573 --> 01:01:51.833]  News.
[01:01:52.731 --> 01:01:54.734]  Of course, they're not going to talk about it on mainstream media.
[01:01:55.054 --> 01:02:07.871]  Just like right now, they're already getting their public story together to backtrack on the mandatory hotel quarantine, because now that I made that video and Canadians realize they have rights and all they have to do is refuse the test and refuse the quarantine,
[01:02:08.411 --> 01:02:11.673]  Now they know that that's not going to work because too many people are refusing it.
[01:02:11.913 --> 01:02:17.577]  And the last thing the government wants to do is let the entire world know that they lost control of the population.
[01:02:17.837 --> 01:02:22.300]  So they're going to come up with a public story that allows them to save face and backtrack on the quarantine idea.
[01:02:22.540 --> 01:02:33.347]  And already you see multiple mainstream publications publishing stories saying girls are being sexually assaulted by the private security at these quarantine hotels and they're calling for an end to the quarantine hotels.
[01:02:33.807 --> 01:02:37.690]  Then they even got the Conservative Party of Canada to pen an opinion piece saying they're against
[01:02:38.069 --> 01:02:39.069]  These quarantine hotels.
[01:02:39.090 --> 01:02:46.593]  So now we got an entire political party who already threw multiple people out of the Conservative Party just for questioning lockdown.
[01:02:47.033 --> 01:02:53.016]  Now they're coming out and coming out against these hotel quarantines because they know it's not going to work because now too many people understand they can say no.
[01:02:53.276 --> 01:02:54.497]  Too many people are rejecting it.
[01:02:54.737 --> 01:03:07.203]  And so whenever you come back, whenever you speak out in one voice in united non-compliance against the government and you don't do what they say and it works in your favor, they always come up with an excuse to make it look like they either gave you permission
[01:03:07.922 --> 01:03:11.491]  Or they just backtracked for some other reason and it wasn't because you just said no to them.
[01:03:11.812 --> 01:03:16.844]  And they're definitely not going to say it's because Chris Sky made a video at the airport and millions of people now know that they have rights.
[01:03:17.862 --> 01:03:19.243]  I'll tell you what's incredible, brother.
[01:03:19.644 --> 01:03:20.905]  I told my wife this last night.
[01:03:20.945 --> 01:03:23.467]  I said, Chris Sky makes me feel alive.
[01:03:23.487 --> 01:03:24.227]  I'm like, we're going to win.
[01:03:24.247 --> 01:03:25.709]  I'm like, we're simpatico.
[01:03:26.129 --> 01:03:27.310]  Because you're not listening to me.
[01:03:28.191 --> 01:03:29.572]  We listen to each other, but it's the truth.
[01:03:29.912 --> 01:03:31.353]  We're seeing the same thing.
[01:03:31.654 --> 01:03:32.274]  We're clicked.
[01:03:32.574 --> 01:03:33.315]  You're on fire.
[01:03:33.415 --> 01:03:34.156]  Others are on fire.
[01:03:34.496 --> 01:03:38.860]  And we've just got to be joyful about this and say we're not buying it and just say no to it.
[01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:43.381]  I mean, it pisses me off that the old people are dying from no vitamin D3.
[01:03:43.501 --> 01:03:52.005]  It pisses me off that they've got almost double or triple the number of black folks dying who live in the Northern Hemisphere with the damn COVID because they don't have D3.
[01:03:52.025 --> 01:03:53.745]  They're always dying because they don't have it.
[01:03:53.965 --> 01:03:55.246]  It's not some virtue signal.
[01:03:55.326 --> 01:03:56.166]  I love black people.
[01:03:56.486 --> 01:03:57.286]  I love everybody!
[01:03:57.687 --> 01:03:58.187]  My God!
[01:03:58.267 --> 01:04:01.728]  I mean, I would help a family, you know, that had a car wreck, no matter what color they are.
[01:04:02.048 --> 01:04:06.010]  And the media won't tell people all they need is vitamin D3 and C.
[01:04:07.731 --> 01:04:08.311]  It's murder!
[01:04:08.471 --> 01:04:10.033]  It's murder is what it is!
[01:04:10.053 --> 01:04:14.577]  And when I see some Black Lives Matter person or the media like, Jones is a racist!
[01:04:15.398 --> 01:04:19.081]  I saw like some big cartoon on Twitter that was trending of me as a KKK leader.
[01:04:19.541 --> 01:04:22.604]  I mean, I'm not even mad they're calling me a KKK leader!
[01:04:22.824 --> 01:04:30.852]  They literally follow George Soros, a Nazi, and they know black people living in the Northern Hemisphere gotta have vitamin D3, and they're dying and they won't tell them!
[01:04:31.252 --> 01:04:32.874]  I want to strangle these people, man!
[01:04:34.008 --> 01:04:36.090]  Why would they tell you something that's going to benefit you?
[01:04:36.411 --> 01:04:38.793]  Every single thing the government's telling you... Exactly!
[01:04:38.813 --> 01:04:39.654]  Why are they like this?
[01:04:39.734 --> 01:04:41.156]  Why would you do this to people?
[01:04:42.077 --> 01:04:45.561]  Because they're sick psychopaths and that's how it's easy to predict what they're going to do next.
[01:04:45.601 --> 01:04:50.987]  You just got to think like a sadistic psychopath and then you always can come up with what the government's going to do next.
[01:04:51.187 --> 01:04:51.548]  I agree.
[01:04:51.628 --> 01:04:54.191]  I like to get the sickest stuff and it's exactly what they always do.
[01:04:55.046 --> 01:04:55.727]  A hundred percent.
[01:04:55.787 --> 01:04:57.849]  They always will do the most depraved thing.
[01:04:57.889 --> 01:05:02.893]  You can give a hundred solutions to a problem and they'll choose the one that's more... Why do they do that?
[01:05:02.953 --> 01:05:04.014]  What the hell is going on?
[01:05:04.855 --> 01:05:06.577]  That's why they're in politics in the first place.
[01:05:07.077 --> 01:05:10.941]  If you don't think... Anybody can watch our premier Doug Ford speak on TV.
[01:05:11.241 --> 01:05:12.842]  And first of all, I touched on this.
[01:05:13.063 --> 01:05:14.544]  He has an essential business.
[01:05:14.926 --> 01:05:19.550]  That's making more money while the lockdowns go on than it would be if we weren't on lockdown.
[01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:28.078]  So that's a complete conflict of interest, and he's actually drafting policies that make every single business in the country buy products from his business.
[01:05:28.518 --> 01:05:30.420]  So this is the kind of thing we're dealing with in Canada.
[01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:34.604]  Oh yeah, it's the same thing here where Bill Gates, like, he was on, I saw this, everybody freaked out about it.
[01:05:34.624 --> 01:05:36.265]  Guys, type in Bill Gates 60 Minutes.
[01:05:36.565 --> 01:05:41.250]  It was like two weeks ago with the other big robber baron, even richer than Gates.
[01:05:42.278 --> 01:05:42.678]  What's his name?
[01:05:42.719 --> 01:05:43.259]  Anderson Cooper.
[01:05:43.660 --> 01:05:50.288]  And like 12 minutes in, it says in the video, this program paid for by Pfizer, which Bill Gates owns!
[01:05:51.249 --> 01:05:53.192]  I mean, it's like, it's ridiculous!
[01:05:54.718 --> 01:05:56.740]  Well, that's the biggest problem on social media.
[01:05:56.760 --> 01:05:58.481]  Why do you think you got banned off social media?
[01:05:58.501 --> 01:06:00.283]  Why do you think they try to censor me off social media?
[01:06:00.563 --> 01:06:02.484]  All their advertisements come from Big Pharma.
[01:06:02.865 --> 01:06:17.016]  Meanwhile, Mark Zuckerberg made a video, a video, where even he is questioning the safety and efficacy of the mRNA vaccine, admitting that he wasn't recommended, admitting it's never been made, it's never been done on humans before.
[01:06:17.577 --> 01:06:23.742]  Meanwhile, if you post something negative about the vaccine on his platform on Facebook, it'll get removed and you'll get banned.
[01:06:24.262 --> 01:06:30.946]  But he actually went on, he had to go, the vaccine is actually so bad that he literally had to make a video to cover his own ass.
[01:06:31.306 --> 01:06:32.247]  That's how sad this is.
[01:06:32.347 --> 01:06:34.688]  Exactly, all they're doing is covering their asses.
[01:06:34.728 --> 01:06:35.569]  Explain that to people.
[01:06:36.450 --> 01:06:40.232]  Well, of course, they want to make sure they're unaccountable for their actions because they see the pushback coming.
[01:06:40.692 --> 01:06:42.573]  We're, call me Murphy's Law.
[01:06:42.713 --> 01:06:44.514]  What can go wrong, will go wrong.
[01:06:44.594 --> 01:06:45.755]  And I'll make it go wrong.
[01:06:46.055 --> 01:06:47.356]  That's why they're in such a rush.
[01:06:47.436 --> 01:06:49.097]  Exactly, we're making it go wrong.
[01:06:49.137 --> 01:06:49.878]  That's why they're here.
[01:06:50.632 --> 01:06:52.034]  And I know you're not threatened.
[01:06:52.054 --> 01:06:53.256]  They can kill us, can't they?
[01:06:53.277 --> 01:06:54.418]  You were dialed into the Zeitgeist.
[01:06:54.438 --> 01:06:55.300]  We love humanity, man.
[01:06:55.620 --> 01:06:56.742]  Isn't it empowering to do this?
[01:06:56.802 --> 01:06:57.984]  I see you got that joy.
[01:06:58.245 --> 01:06:59.066]  We're not scared of them.
[01:06:59.106 --> 01:06:59.807]  I don't care what happens.
[01:07:00.626 --> 01:07:01.546]  You think I'm afraid of them?
[01:07:01.606 --> 01:07:03.027]  If I was afraid of them, I wouldn't be here.
[01:07:03.307 --> 01:07:04.147]  I wouldn't be smiling.
[01:07:04.467 --> 01:07:05.547]  I'm definitely not afraid of them.
[01:07:05.607 --> 01:07:08.988]  I know they're afraid of me, and they should be, because we are coming for them.
[01:07:09.248 --> 01:07:10.549]  We are going to wake everybody up.
[01:07:10.809 --> 01:07:12.049]  We are going to hold them accountable.
[01:07:12.229 --> 01:07:14.150]  That's why in Canada, they're trying to make laws.
[01:07:14.190 --> 01:07:24.973]  The government's actually trying to pass laws so they can't be held legally liable or financially liable for all the problems that they cause, because they know that the reckoning is coming.
[01:07:25.373 --> 01:07:31.018]  It's obvious that the consequences of the lockdown itself
[01:07:31.403 --> 01:07:34.844]  Are far worse than the consequences of COVID.
[01:07:34.924 --> 01:07:35.785]  A hundred times.
[01:07:36.205 --> 01:07:36.865]  A hundred times.
[01:07:37.225 --> 01:07:38.406]  At least, at least.
[01:07:38.666 --> 01:07:41.027]  COVID you have, you have people dying.
[01:07:41.247 --> 01:07:42.987]  97% of them are 60 plus in Canada.
[01:07:43.287 --> 01:07:46.549]  Less than 300 people under age 60 have died in Canada from COVID.
[01:07:46.749 --> 01:07:47.989]  So how dangerous is it really?
[01:07:48.369 --> 01:07:49.050]  Not that dangerous.
[01:07:49.210 --> 01:07:50.370]  How dangerous is lockdown?
[01:07:50.770 --> 01:07:55.412]  We lost 230,000 jobs in just in Ontario in one month.
[01:07:55.712 --> 01:07:58.853]  We lost over 350,000 businesses since this started.
[01:07:58.873 --> 01:08:00.514]  Suicide is off the charts.
[01:08:00.814 --> 01:08:02.635]  Suicide is at record highs.
[01:08:02.995 --> 01:08:04.216]  Overdose is at record highs.
[01:08:04.436 --> 01:08:06.118]  Spousal abuse is at record highs.
[01:08:06.418 --> 01:08:07.058]  Divorces.
[01:08:07.579 --> 01:08:10.060]  Everything is up in record highs where it shouldn't be.
[01:08:10.100 --> 01:08:14.123]  People are missing life-saving surgeries for cancer, heart disease, etc.
[01:08:14.243 --> 01:08:18.826]  Even the New York Times admits the death toll is probably 10 times.
[01:08:18.846 --> 01:08:19.847]  Like you said, it's higher.
[01:08:20.427 --> 01:08:23.948]  And they go, well, the lockdown, we had to, but it has killed 15 million people.
[01:08:24.248 --> 01:08:25.889]  No, you killed them, New York Times.
[01:08:26.369 --> 01:08:28.270]  And we made a big deal about that six months ago.
[01:08:28.310 --> 01:08:32.932]  You notice the UN came out, the head envoy said, yeah, we shouldn't do lockdowns to cover their ass.
[01:08:33.372 --> 01:08:36.153]  But then the leaders of the West all keep pushing them.
[01:08:36.413 --> 01:08:39.474]  Because again, yeah, OK, we go bankrupt under lockdown, folks.
[01:08:39.494 --> 01:08:42.696]  They starve to death in Africa and Latin America.
[01:08:42.856 --> 01:08:44.596]  People go, well, there are a lot of people down there, Alex.
[01:08:45.016 --> 01:08:46.537]  Folks, you're going to sign on to killing those people?
[01:08:46.997 --> 01:08:48.538]  We should educate them and build them up.
[01:08:49.258 --> 01:08:49.899]  That's what we do.
[01:08:49.919 --> 01:08:51.800]  I'm gonna explain it again, people.
[01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:53.721]  You do it to them, it happens to you.
[01:08:53.761 --> 01:08:54.622]  It's what Jesus said.
[01:08:55.002 --> 01:08:57.384]  You do this to the least of me, I'm gonna do it to you.
[01:08:57.404 --> 01:08:59.065]  Yes.
[01:09:00.066 --> 01:09:01.207]  We need to empower everybody.
[01:09:01.287 --> 01:09:03.708]  Everyone, at least in North America, needs to know their rights.
[01:09:03.788 --> 01:09:04.989]  They need to assert their rights.
[01:09:05.309 --> 01:09:07.751]  They need to not comply with everything that's going on.
[01:09:08.051 --> 01:09:10.393]  There's no scientific basis for lockdown.
[01:09:10.673 --> 01:09:14.436]  They lock you down, and then they tell you, oh, it would have been worse if we didn't lock you down.
[01:09:14.556 --> 01:09:14.836]  Really?
[01:09:15.136 --> 01:09:17.138]  Look at New York versus Florida.
[01:09:18.052 --> 01:09:23.695]  New York is completely locked down, and Florida is basically completely open, and who's doing better?
[01:09:24.836 --> 01:09:25.156]  Florida.
[01:09:25.536 --> 01:09:26.697]  The one that's not locked down.
[01:09:26.777 --> 01:09:27.317]  Surprise!
[01:09:27.597 --> 01:09:28.618]  Sweden's not locked down.
[01:09:28.658 --> 01:09:29.558]  Japan's not locked down.
[01:09:29.738 --> 01:09:34.541]  There's lots of places that are not locked down that didn't go through lockdown that fared far better than the places that did.
[01:09:34.561 --> 01:09:35.421]  So let me ask you this.
[01:09:35.561 --> 01:09:38.003]  It's all the places that are rebelling that did this as a lockdown.
[01:09:38.403 --> 01:09:41.164]  Where do you see Chris Sky coming next?
[01:09:41.184 --> 01:09:43.025]  You've got your finger on the zeitgeist.
[01:09:43.045 --> 01:09:43.746]  What's coming next?
[01:09:44.733 --> 01:09:52.577]  In Canada, by mid-March, they're going to come up with the whole variant bullsh** and they're going to use that as an excuse to fully lock us down like they did last March.
[01:09:53.437 --> 01:09:56.899]  And they're going to try to do the same thing with checkpoints between the provinces.
[01:09:56.919 --> 01:09:58.560]  They're going to go full-out Nazi on us.
[01:09:58.940 --> 01:10:08.344]  And they're going to keep the state of the... And again, I'm not an enemy of cops, but man, watching cops get on board with this, especially in leftist areas, the right-wing cops in right-wing areas don't wear a mask and laugh at it.
[01:10:08.645 --> 01:10:11.606]  The leftist cops are the worst people on the... They're horrible.
[01:10:12.605 --> 01:10:21.529]  They are, but we have to give our cops a very big shout out, especially in Ontario, because the way I've been treated in other parts of Canada and other parts of the world is not even comparable.
[01:10:21.549 --> 01:10:25.491]  No, no, no, I'm saying statistically there are a lot of good cops, but there's also like nests of really bad ones.
[01:10:26.171 --> 01:10:29.493]  They're creating leftist special units of COVID police.
[01:10:30.253 --> 01:10:33.574]  They call them bad apples, but there's a lot more than a few bad apples in the bunch.
[01:10:33.935 --> 01:10:41.458]  But, for the most part, our police are fantastic, and there's an entire organization called Police on Guard for Thee, and I want to mention them.
[01:10:42.003 --> 01:10:45.704]  And they are active duty and retired police and military.
[01:10:46.044 --> 01:10:48.505]  And there's tens of thousands of them that have already signed up.
[01:10:48.805 --> 01:10:50.945]  And their big thing is to honor their oath.
[01:10:51.065 --> 01:10:55.166]  And their oath is to our Charter of Rights over and above these emergency orders.
[01:10:55.366 --> 01:10:57.247]  They don't want to be enforcers for this kind of direction.
[01:10:57.267 --> 01:10:57.507]  No, I agree.
[01:10:57.527 --> 01:10:58.967]  We should challenge the bad cops.
[01:11:00.028 --> 01:11:00.448]  Exactly.
[01:11:00.588 --> 01:11:01.968]  And that's what they're doing.
[01:11:02.288 --> 01:11:04.989]  It's right now, I'd say about at least 30% of the cops
[01:11:06.348 --> 01:11:06.568]  I think so.
[01:11:28.001 --> 01:11:33.684]  And now the police have hired him to file a separate suit on behalf of them to try to end these lockdown measures.
[01:11:33.884 --> 01:11:36.545]  So the police are actually fighting the lockdown in some areas?
[01:11:37.245 --> 01:11:38.086]  They literally are.
[01:11:38.126 --> 01:11:45.929]  They're fighting it legally, and I'm hoping that sooner or later this organization comes out publicly and starts fighting with us on the front lines, because we're going to need them.
[01:11:46.369 --> 01:11:56.314]  Because they're going to keep the emergency, they already have the emergency orders in place, then they increase it to a special state of emergency that allowed them to arrest protesters and stop people from publicly assembling.
[01:11:56.755 --> 01:12:05.862]  And they're going to keep that going using the variant as the excuse, and it's just another one of our rights and freedoms that they ratcheted away from us without people noticing for the most part.
[01:12:06.402 --> 01:12:10.706]  And so, just like everything else, when the government takes something from you, they don't give it back.
[01:12:10.886 --> 01:12:16.930]  They tell you they're going to take it from you temporarily, then they increase the time that they took it from you, and then after a year or two they pay off.
[01:12:16.950 --> 01:12:18.932]  Oh yeah, they set the precedent, but let's talk about this.
[01:12:20.648 --> 01:12:21.830]  You're being Canada-centric.
[01:12:21.870 --> 01:12:22.750]  You've been all over the world.
[01:12:22.810 --> 01:12:28.135]  You're probably one of the leading physical activists who's actually out there saying no to these.
[01:12:28.155 --> 01:12:32.879]  You're now on house arrest, and you've proven, like I said, you know what's coming next.
[01:12:33.820 --> 01:12:39.225]  How do you see the enemy striking back, not just with the lockdowns, but other procedures, other things?
[01:12:39.265 --> 01:12:40.907]  What else is on your radar, Chris Sky?
[01:12:41.447 --> 01:12:45.411]  The huge things they're going to do is they're going to get places like the school boards
[01:12:46.031 --> 01:12:56.880]  Uh, to really try to enforce the mask policies because one of the other huge pushbacks I'm doing is I actually made an online template of what to say to your school to get mask free because the law is very clear.
[01:12:57.180 --> 01:12:58.121]  Law is number one.
[01:12:58.281 --> 01:12:59.502]  Their policy means nothing.
[01:12:59.892 --> 01:13:02.453]  The law states that anybody can ask for a medical exemption.
[01:13:02.633 --> 01:13:04.033]  They cannot ask what the condition is.
[01:13:04.053 --> 01:13:05.494]  They cannot ask for proof of the condition.
[01:13:05.514 --> 01:13:06.814]  They cannot ask for a doctor's note.
[01:13:07.054 --> 01:13:09.435]  They cannot tell your child that they have to do online school.
[01:13:09.455 --> 01:13:13.676]  And they cannot disclude your child from any other type of activity at the school.
[01:13:14.196 --> 01:13:19.458]  Meanwhile, when you go talk to the school, first thing they'll say is, school board policy is you have to wear a mask.
[01:13:19.778 --> 01:13:22.699]  Then they'll tell you school board policy is, oh, you need a doctor's note.
[01:13:22.719 --> 01:13:28.941]  Because they know 99.9% of the doctors have been told by their physician's college, do not give out notes.
[01:13:29.676 --> 01:13:33.079]  So then the parent goes to the doctor and says, I need a doctor's note.
[01:13:33.099 --> 01:13:33.899]  The doctor says no.
[01:13:33.919 --> 01:13:35.881]  And then the parent goes home and throws up their arm and says,
[01:13:36.255 --> 01:13:37.376]  Sorry to their little children.
[01:13:37.416 --> 01:13:37.837]  I tried.
[01:13:37.877 --> 01:13:38.797]  The school says we can't.
[01:13:39.138 --> 01:13:39.358]  No.
[01:13:39.638 --> 01:13:42.601]  You tell the school, very simply, I know my rights.
[01:13:42.901 --> 01:13:43.542]  I know the law.
[01:13:43.762 --> 01:13:45.303]  I want the medical exemption form.
[01:13:45.564 --> 01:13:47.105]  You do not need to know what their condition is.
[01:13:47.125 --> 01:13:48.306]  You do not need a doctor's note.
[01:13:48.326 --> 01:13:49.207]  And what you said is key.
[01:13:49.327 --> 01:13:55.412]  They have to proviso in law and regulation, admit you don't have to, but then their enforcers try to make you.
[01:13:55.673 --> 01:14:01.278]  I'm sure you saw the video in Canada that Dan Dick shot where they choked the guy out for no reason at a tire shop.
[01:14:03.339 --> 01:14:05.484]  Yes, but there's more to that video than we saw.
[01:14:05.504 --> 01:14:07.269]  First, I'm going to finish what I was just saying.
[01:14:07.449 --> 01:14:07.910]  Go ahead.
[01:14:08.618 --> 01:14:19.747]  Because I said they talk about the policies, you have to tell them that the law trumps the policy, and if they have a problem with that, you're going to file a human rights complaint, and you're going to name the principal or superintendent of the school.
[01:14:19.767 --> 01:14:21.208]  Yeah, start over, I interrupted, I'm sorry.
[01:14:21.509 --> 01:14:28.795]  So yeah, making our kids wear these masks, making them get viral pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, suppressing them, that's what the fight is.
[01:14:28.815 --> 01:14:33.298]  So people need to legally know, whether you're in Canada, the U.S., England, it doesn't matter, the law is basically the same.
[01:14:34.039 --> 01:14:34.619]  Explain it to them.
[01:14:35.941 --> 01:14:37.262]  All they need to do is tell them,
[01:14:38.183 --> 01:14:39.204]  They want the exemption.
[01:14:39.264 --> 01:14:40.004]  They know the law.
[01:14:40.305 --> 01:14:44.048]  Law trumps and supersedes any policy that the school board can come up with.
[01:14:44.408 --> 01:14:52.615]  And if they refuse, you file a human rights complaint against the school and you name whoever's in charge of the school, the principal or superintendent, personally in that human rights.
[01:14:52.735 --> 01:14:55.137]  And if 10 parents per school do it, it's over.
[01:14:55.417 --> 01:14:56.598]  But somebody's got to stand up.
[01:14:57.338 --> 01:14:57.699]  That's it.
[01:14:57.779 --> 01:14:59.120]  But they're doing it all over.
[01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:03.043]  I actually made a template of this that people can screenshot and I'm sending it out to them on Instagram.
[01:15:03.613 --> 01:15:09.335]  And the principal and superintendents act all tough because they think the school board is going to back them up.
[01:15:09.636 --> 01:15:20.480]  As soon as you write that human rights violation and it says in there, this person is willfully violating the law and my child's rights after I explained it to them and after I specifically requested them to follow the law.
[01:15:20.919 --> 01:15:21.579]  They are screwed.
[01:15:21.599 --> 01:15:22.380]  They work with children.
[01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:25.482]  You get a human rights complaint against you when you work with children, your career is done.
[01:15:25.582 --> 01:15:28.223]  And we have to fight up front before this is all normalized.
[01:15:28.704 --> 01:15:29.924]  So what energized you?
[01:15:29.964 --> 01:15:31.505]  What was the moment you saw this happening?
[01:15:31.686 --> 01:15:35.488]  Because you were involved, I've seen like back in March of last year, so a year ago.
[01:15:35.868 --> 01:15:38.450]  What energized you to take this step into the future?
[01:15:38.470 --> 01:15:40.311]  Because others need to do what you've done, Chris.
[01:15:41.271 --> 01:15:44.113]  Well, I was on vacation when all this started.
[01:15:44.613 --> 01:15:45.494]  I was actually in
[01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:46.960]  Venice.
[01:15:47.100 --> 01:15:52.744]  I landed in Venice for Carnival, the big festival they have at the end of February every year since like the 1700s.
[01:15:53.664 --> 01:15:58.227]  And the day I landed there was the day that they cancelled Carnival for the first time ever.
[01:15:58.652 --> 01:16:00.814]  And they started putting all these roaming lockdowns in.
[01:16:01.154 --> 01:16:06.878]  And I was in Italy, and I was training at the gym, shopping, eating, everything was pretty normal even though they had closed off, they stopped Carnival.
[01:16:07.218 --> 01:16:15.564]  But I'm getting all these calls from people saying, oh there's this crazy pandemic going on in Italy, Venice is the epicenter, and everybody was acting like I was gonna die and not make it home.
[01:16:15.904 --> 01:16:17.886]  And I was just like having a normal vacation.
[01:16:17.906 --> 01:16:20.488]  Hospitals are full, everyone, none of it's true, just total death.
[01:16:20.968 --> 01:16:22.129]  Yes, and I was right there.
[01:16:22.149 --> 01:16:25.311]  So I knew that the TV was blowing everything completely out of proportion.
[01:16:25.692 --> 01:16:29.995]  I was lucky enough to end up leaving Italy just a few days before they locked down the whole country.
[01:16:30.275 --> 01:16:33.377]  And then I ended up in Netherlands and France before I came back to Toronto.
[01:16:33.718 --> 01:16:37.140]  So when I got back to Toronto, it was beginning of March, right before our lockdown happened.
[01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:39.902]  So I told everybody, I'm like, they're going to lock us down.
[01:16:39.942 --> 01:16:40.803]  They did it in Europe.
[01:16:40.843 --> 01:16:41.663]  They're going to do it here.
[01:16:41.703 --> 01:16:44.485]  It's like, it's not going to be a single country thing.
[01:16:44.986 --> 01:16:47.027]  So that was the first prediction I made.
[01:16:47.067 --> 01:16:49.229]  And then sure enough, within two weeks, we were locked down.
[01:16:49.622 --> 01:16:54.446]  And then when they locked us down, I was, I knew when they said two weeks, it's definitely not going to be two weeks.
[01:16:54.746 --> 01:16:57.929]  I knew they were going to plan on keeping going basically forever if they could.
[01:16:58.309 --> 01:17:01.151]  So right away I said, our small businesses are going to get screwed.
[01:17:01.191 --> 01:17:03.553]  And if our small businesses get screwed, Canada's screwed.
[01:17:03.573 --> 01:17:07.096]  So you recognize an assault day one, cause you got your, you got your head screwed on.
[01:17:07.997 --> 01:17:08.357]  Of course.
[01:17:08.437 --> 01:17:10.319]  We all knew this was coming from a long time ago.
[01:17:10.339 --> 01:17:13.021]  It was just, what was there going to be their method of implementation?
[01:17:13.361 --> 01:17:16.964]  And their method of implementation is a plandemic where they use a virus.
[01:17:17.024 --> 01:17:19.126]  They exaggerate the hell out of this virus.
[01:17:19.468 --> 01:17:24.889]  And they scare the hell out of the people to give up their rights and freedoms under the guise of safety.
[01:17:24.969 --> 01:17:29.450]  And what do we know about giving up your freedom for safety?
[01:17:29.750 --> 01:17:30.410]  You never get it.
[01:17:31.350 --> 01:17:31.771]  Thank you.
[01:17:31.891 --> 01:17:32.891]  And you don't deserve either.
[01:17:33.291 --> 01:17:34.511]  So that's what they're doing.
[01:17:34.571 --> 01:17:36.992]  And I mentioned it, that their weapon is fear.
[01:17:37.012 --> 01:17:39.052]  Because fear will paralyze you.
[01:17:39.172 --> 01:17:40.852]  Fear will keep you from acting out.
[01:17:40.932 --> 01:17:43.833]  And fear will have you confused and waiting to be told what to do next.
[01:17:44.264 --> 01:17:48.127]  And then for the people like me that aren't afraid, they use division.
[01:17:48.547 --> 01:17:51.569]  Division is their method to try to stop or attack.
[01:17:51.849 --> 01:17:56.072]  So they divided us from people that were afraid of the virus versus people not afraid of the virus.
[01:17:56.412 --> 01:17:58.874]  People who wear masks versus people who don't wear masks.
[01:17:59.114 --> 01:18:02.937]  Oh, they had that big Harvard and a bunch of other universities.
[01:18:03.437 --> 01:18:09.741]  Yale did studies over two years ago before this about how to make us take shots, how to make us accept lockdowns.
[01:18:09.761 --> 01:18:12.083]  I mean, they've premeditated this whole damn thing.
[01:18:13.140 --> 01:18:13.760]  Of course they did.
[01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:19.282]  And I'll talk about that picture you just showed with the police in a second because that was another one of our big victories we did.
[01:18:19.322 --> 01:18:25.524]  We were hosting parties all summer on the beach, running all night with the full support of the Toronto Police.
[01:18:25.784 --> 01:18:29.626]  They sent those police there to arrest me that night and to try to stop the parties.
[01:18:29.926 --> 01:18:39.229]  And instead of stopping the parties and arresting me, those police asked me to take that picture with them and then they posted it on the official Toronto Police Instagram page.
[01:18:39.676 --> 01:18:53.845]  And they gave me all these nice flattering hashtags, to the point where they got so vilified in the media, they actually launched a professional standards investigation against the officers and tried to take their badge, and one of them had 18 years on the force, the other one had 8 years on the force.
[01:18:54.105 --> 01:18:54.766]  Two detectives.
[01:18:55.226 --> 01:18:58.789]  And just because they supported me, rather than try to shut me down.
[01:18:58.949 --> 01:19:00.630]  Just because they didn't want to be slaves, they're bad.
[01:19:01.450 --> 01:19:01.911]  That's right.
[01:19:01.991 --> 01:19:04.352]  But it's okay, we have nothing else to lose but fight this.
[01:19:05.113 --> 01:19:05.993]  It's only going to get worse.
[01:19:06.333 --> 01:19:08.235]  So just stop worrying folks, let's go to war.
[01:19:09.073 --> 01:19:09.974]  That's why we were there.
[01:19:10.034 --> 01:19:11.835]  That's why I said you're not shutting down this party.
[01:19:11.876 --> 01:19:12.296]  This is our party.
[01:19:12.336 --> 01:19:17.380]  And this war is have our restaurants, have our businesses, go to the beach, be with your family, go to the park.
[01:19:17.721 --> 01:19:19.482]  Anybody trying to stop you is full of crap.
[01:19:19.843 --> 01:19:21.744]  If there's a real disease out there, we'll stay at home.
[01:19:21.784 --> 01:19:22.285]  We know that.
[01:19:23.131 --> 01:19:26.333]  Yes, if people were dying left, right and center in the streets, I'd be staying home too.
[01:19:26.533 --> 01:19:28.254]  That's me getting a ticket right there, actually.
[01:19:28.954 --> 01:19:33.076]  Sorry, that's me taking everyone on the subway the day that mandatory masks became mandatory.
[01:19:33.416 --> 01:19:39.500]  And within a week from that, I was the one that invented and created the face mask exemption card.
[01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:45.583]  And I don't have one with me or I'd show it to you right now, but I made them within a week of the mask going mandatory.
[01:19:45.603 --> 01:19:47.444]  They're printed on really nice plastic.
[01:19:47.764 --> 01:19:49.485]  They had the Canadian flag on it.
[01:19:49.525 --> 01:19:51.746]  They looked like they had been issued by Health Canada.
[01:19:52.126 --> 01:19:54.950]  And they simply said, they didn't say it was an official card or anything.
[01:19:55.330 --> 01:19:58.474]  All they said is, I am medically exempt from wearing a mask.
[01:19:58.634 --> 01:19:59.716]  And that's all you have to say.
[01:19:59.776 --> 01:20:01.398]  And I tried to spin it that you were a fraud.
[01:20:01.458 --> 01:20:02.259]  No, you didn't say that.
[01:20:02.519 --> 01:20:03.761]  You pointed out what the law was.
[01:20:04.525 --> 01:20:04.985]  Exactly!
[01:20:05.185 --> 01:20:08.607]  Everyone was saying I made these fake cards and I said they're not fake cards.
[01:20:08.967 --> 01:20:11.489]  They're cards that inform people of your medical exemption.
[01:20:11.509 --> 01:20:12.589]  You don't need the card.
[01:20:12.809 --> 01:20:15.631]  You can walk into any store and simply say I have a medical exemption.
[01:20:15.871 --> 01:20:17.592]  But people like the idea of the card.
[01:20:18.812 --> 01:20:23.315]  My wife all the time goes almost every day to the grocery store or wherever and they come over and say you got to wear this.
[01:20:23.335 --> 01:20:25.936]  You get a manager, the manager comes over and they go, no you're right, medical exemption.
[01:20:26.336 --> 01:20:27.137]  And just do it.
[01:20:28.197 --> 01:20:28.577]  Exactly.
[01:20:28.617 --> 01:20:33.700]  So some people, a lot of people like the idea of just pulling out a card, showing it to them and then nobody would bother them anymore.
[01:20:34.190 --> 01:20:39.452]  And they were so successful, I gave out almost 20,000 of those just in and around Ontario alone.
[01:20:39.472 --> 01:20:45.935]  I must be clear, you haven't adapted by submitting, you've adapted by overcoming and you're empowered and you're stronger than ever.
[01:20:46.395 --> 01:20:47.475]  Others need to see this example.
[01:20:47.495 --> 01:20:53.358]  Let's play a clip that, as I mentioned, your Prime Minister Trudeau endorsing communist China dictatorship.
[01:20:53.838 --> 01:20:56.039]  He should be out of office, this clip should destroy him.
[01:20:56.399 --> 01:20:59.380]  But instead, the average leftist loves this.
[01:20:59.400 --> 01:20:59.740]  Here it is.
[01:21:00.641 --> 01:21:01.901]  And that's the model for Canada.
[01:21:01.981 --> 01:21:02.442]  It's China.
[01:21:03.871 --> 01:21:21.766]  The level of admiration I actually have for China, because their basic dictatorship is allowing them to actually turn their economy around on a dime and say, we need to go green as fast as we need to start, you know, investing in solar.
[01:21:21.786 --> 01:21:28.212]  I mean, there is a flexibility that I know Stephen Harper must dream about of having a dictatorship that he could do everything he wanted.
[01:21:29.619 --> 01:21:32.204]  Bunch of women drinking wine, hearing about dictatorship.
[01:21:32.504 --> 01:21:35.169]  They're not in a slave camp, but they're going to be in one soon.
[01:21:35.309 --> 01:21:36.832]  Go ahead.
[01:21:36.852 --> 01:21:39.096]  These women are drinking wine.
[01:21:39.116 --> 01:21:40.018]  They're on a power trip.
[01:21:40.319 --> 01:21:41.882]  They have no idea how dangerous this is.
[01:21:42.962 --> 01:21:47.605]  He's telling everybody straight up the thing he admires most about China is the fact that it's a dictatorship.
[01:21:47.865 --> 01:21:53.508]  So the fact that they can push things like the environmentalism down the throats of their people without them being able to say no.
[01:21:53.848 --> 01:21:55.249]  And that's what he wants in Canada.
[01:21:55.269 --> 01:21:57.610]  He wants to be able to push this green agenda on you.
[01:21:58.831 --> 01:21:59.571]  Stop coal.
[01:21:59.611 --> 01:22:01.492]  Stop being able to heat your house the right way.
[01:22:01.512 --> 01:22:03.373]  He wants to force green energy on us.
[01:22:03.433 --> 01:22:04.834]  It's going to cost us all kinds of money.
[01:22:05.219 --> 01:22:08.581]  He wants to stop our production and refining of our own gasoline and oil.
[01:22:08.821 --> 01:22:11.482]  We have so much oil production in Canada, and what do we do with it?
[01:22:11.762 --> 01:22:15.564]  We send it to the United States, let you guys refine it, and then sell it back to us.
[01:22:15.965 --> 01:22:20.527]  Our gas prices are twice as high as your gas prices, and 30% of our gas price is taxes.
[01:22:20.867 --> 01:22:30.352]  And now we have the new carbon tax, and he's going to, on January 1st, he announced that the carbon tax is going to be rising perpetually every single year.
[01:22:31.059 --> 01:22:33.102]  As well as our HST is going to be going up.
[01:22:33.342 --> 01:22:38.669]  So all he's doing is increasing taxes so he can increase his control so they can increase dependence on the government.
[01:22:39.008 --> 01:22:40.709]  So he can increase the power of the government.
[01:22:40.889 --> 01:22:41.269]  And why?
[01:22:41.289 --> 01:22:42.510]  Because he wants to be like China.
[01:22:42.530 --> 01:22:43.730]  He just said it to you guys.
[01:22:43.970 --> 01:22:45.911]  He wants to have that dictatorial power.
[01:22:46.132 --> 01:22:47.952]  He wants to be able to lock you down on a whim.
[01:22:48.173 --> 01:22:54.356]  He wants you on a social credit score where you can't even sell your shoes on Kijiji without his permission or him taxing it.
[01:22:54.776 --> 01:22:55.796]  That's what they want, people.
[01:22:55.816 --> 01:22:59.038]  And above all else, they don't want people like me to be able to speak.
[01:22:59.278 --> 01:23:06.882]  They're trying to draft a law right now in our parliament in Canada that will classify people like me that tell you the truth as
[01:23:07.322 --> 01:23:12.008]  Spreading harmful misinformation and to be classified as a terrorist.
[01:23:12.472 --> 01:23:21.457]  That means they can arrest me without bail, they can arrest you without a fair trial, and they can literally treat you like you're someone that came to Canada and you're trying to blow up the CN Tower.
[01:23:21.498 --> 01:23:29.983]  But that's only going to blow up in their face bigger, metaphorically, because that's what tyrants do is they lose a grip, they get even tighter, and that accelerates the awakening.
[01:23:30.003 --> 01:23:30.843]  But you're absolutely right.
[01:23:31.363 --> 01:23:34.525]  Everything we've seen with big tech is now being externalized.
[01:23:34.565 --> 01:23:41.850]  In the US, Canada, Europe, they are taking all those bureaucratic operations from big tech and now it's trying to put it into law.
[01:23:43.052 --> 01:23:43.252]  Yes.
[01:23:44.093 --> 01:23:46.655]  And the reason you asked before, why do you think they waited this long?
[01:23:46.915 --> 01:23:54.361]  For me, to be honest, I think they waited, they wanted to go as quickly as possible because they knew we were waking up, but they were also waiting for the technology they needed to catch up.
[01:23:54.701 --> 01:23:56.663]  And now that 5G is so widespread,
[01:23:57.128 --> 01:24:00.330]  They've been installing it virtually everywhere while we've been locked down.
[01:24:00.671 --> 01:24:02.912]  Now they have that technical control grid in place.
[01:24:03.093 --> 01:24:09.057]  So now when they want to track you, trace you from cradle to grave, they can do it no problem like they never imagined.
[01:24:09.077 --> 01:24:19.825]  And notice day one, they were in Congress two years ago, three years ago, when a guy screamed Allah Akbar and killed a bunch of people in New York and Paul Watson wrote an article for Infowars.com and went to number one on Twitter and they go,
[01:24:20.726 --> 01:24:22.708]  The Congressman Quigley's his name.
[01:24:22.748 --> 01:24:23.229]  I'm not joking.
[01:24:23.249 --> 01:24:26.312]  He goes, I noticed at lunch, InfoWars was top of Twitter.
[01:24:26.332 --> 01:24:28.634]  They go, within two months, sir, we'll have AI.
[01:24:29.175 --> 01:24:30.236]  We'll block it all in the future.
[01:24:30.336 --> 01:24:31.517]  And it actually happened like they said.
[01:24:32.078 --> 01:24:34.761]  So, but they were saying it wasn't true.
[01:24:34.801 --> 01:24:36.422]  The guy did yell Allah Akbar.
[01:24:36.903 --> 01:24:38.945]  So they were just mad that we pointed this out.
[01:24:39.145 --> 01:24:39.646]  It's crazy.
[01:24:40.774 --> 01:24:46.824]  Anytime anybody points out anything that deviates from the narrative and the narrative which is always a lie, they try to vilify you.
[01:24:46.844 --> 01:24:48.166]  I've been called everything like you.
[01:24:48.227 --> 01:24:49.469]  A racist.
[01:24:49.829 --> 01:24:53.796]  The funniest term they call me is the notorious anti-masker.
[01:24:54.175 --> 01:24:56.197]  There's no such thing as an anti-masker.
[01:24:57.297 --> 01:24:59.019]  Humans are not meant to wear a mask.
[01:24:59.219 --> 01:25:01.561]  So if you wear a mask, you are a masker.
[01:25:01.821 --> 01:25:04.563]  If you don't wear a mask, you are called a human being.
[01:25:04.963 --> 01:25:08.406]  So, that whole term is just as bad as calling somebody a racist.
[01:25:08.506 --> 01:25:10.668]  It's the label they use when they don't have an argument.
[01:25:11.021 --> 01:25:13.883]  Like, ask somebody, why are you wearing that mask when you're not sick?
[01:25:14.304 --> 01:25:15.384]  Oh, you're an anti-masker.
[01:25:15.564 --> 01:25:22.990]  It's a political system to divide us further by a corrupt system that is bankrupt and the world's turning against them.
[01:25:23.310 --> 01:25:31.857]  And before the financial collapse they've engineered happens, they want to blame it on COVID, get us all locked up, get us ready to be in a police state, get us ready to have less before they do it.
[01:25:32.277 --> 01:25:33.999]  What's going to happen with all the trendies?
[01:25:34.659 --> 01:25:37.647]  Who look back five years from now and see how they lost everything they had.
[01:25:37.967 --> 01:25:38.789]  How are they going to feel?
[01:25:38.810 --> 01:25:42.318]  Or are they so weak-minded, Chris Sky, they'll still buy into it?
[01:25:43.163 --> 01:25:45.464]  Oh, but they'll rationalize till the day they die.
[01:25:46.065 --> 01:25:50.948]  There's that old adage, it's very much easier to fool someone than convince them that they have been fooled.
[01:25:51.408 --> 01:25:53.769]  And you can just look at the rationalization so far.
[01:25:54.069 --> 01:25:58.492]  It went from two weeks to, oh, it's just a mask to, oh, it's just contact tracing.
[01:25:58.612 --> 01:25:59.933]  Oh, it's just travel restrictions.
[01:26:00.233 --> 01:26:01.233]  Oh, it's just a vaccine.
[01:26:01.253 --> 01:26:05.536]  Oh, it's just a vaccine while I still got to wear a mask and continue to get all the restrictions on me.
[01:26:05.616 --> 01:26:07.317]  Oh, it's just my business being closed forever.
[01:26:07.757 --> 01:26:10.500]  You can keep pushing them and they'll just keep rationalizing it.
[01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:18.669]  And when you even ask people after a year of this, and a year of nothing but lies, and you say, so how much more are you going to put up with?
[01:26:19.149 --> 01:26:23.394]  I hear people say, I'll do whatever it takes, whatever I'm asked to do.
[01:26:23.914 --> 01:26:26.095]  They're almost defiant in their compliance.
[01:26:26.115 --> 01:26:27.716]  That's massive dot-com syndrome.
[01:26:27.736 --> 01:26:32.197]  They've gotten into it, they've decided they're part of the power structure, and they'll do anything.
[01:26:32.217 --> 01:26:32.738]  Well, here's the deal.
[01:26:33.038 --> 01:26:34.498]  You can go kill yourself if you want.
[01:26:34.698 --> 01:26:37.300]  I'm not going along with you, you weaklings.
[01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:38.020]  Because they are.
[01:26:38.040 --> 01:26:45.243]  They're followers that weren't protected by alpha males, and they're now totally captured by their abusers, and they're too weak-minded to even admit it.
[01:26:46.123 --> 01:26:52.946]  There's a very perfect picture from World War I, of all places, that can describe our situation perfectly.
[01:26:53.291 --> 01:27:01.282]  And there's a photo of soldiers and they're walking through a landmine field and one soldier has a donkey on his back and he's carrying this donkey.
[01:27:01.602 --> 01:27:04.726]  And everyone looks at the picture and they're like, why the hell is that guy carrying the donkey?
[01:27:05.047 --> 01:27:10.614]  The people that are buying into it, the people that are wearing the mask, the people that are against people like me, they are the donkeys.
[01:27:10.879 --> 01:27:11.079]  I don't
[01:27:34.617 --> 01:27:39.701]  And how have they killed people's instincts that altruistic, gregarious... Hey, there it is!
[01:27:39.881 --> 01:27:40.722]  Yeah, good males.
[01:27:41.222 --> 01:27:46.787]  People like... I'll be downtown to the leftist, and I'm like, hey, Bill Gates says he wants to kill you.
[01:27:47.187 --> 01:27:48.068]  India banned the vaccine.
[01:27:48.088 --> 01:27:48.908]  They go, I want it!
[01:27:49.168 --> 01:27:49.929]  I love Bill Gates!
[01:27:50.189 --> 01:27:50.570]  F you!
[01:27:50.910 --> 01:27:55.333]  Bill Gates wants to kill him, but they like, they imagine he's their friend, but I'm their enemy.
[01:27:55.373 --> 01:27:56.014]  It's really weird.
[01:27:56.912 --> 01:27:58.593]  It's because you're not on TV, Alex.
[01:27:58.774 --> 01:28:00.655]  Anything that's on TV, they believe.
[01:28:01.036 --> 01:28:01.716]  It's that simple.
[01:28:01.996 --> 01:28:04.238]  That's why they use the TV to brainwash and divide.
[01:28:04.538 --> 01:28:11.024]  And I started with the groups that they got us divided into, and I stopped when we said the maskers versus anti-maskers, but it goes a lot further than that.
[01:28:12.099 --> 01:28:13.640]  The next step is the racial division.
[01:28:13.921 --> 01:28:15.502]  And in Canada, they tried that bullshit.
[01:28:15.522 --> 01:28:18.123]  But we're so multicultural and loving that it just went nowhere.
[01:28:18.504 --> 01:28:20.005]  But in the States, you saw.
[01:28:20.045 --> 01:28:23.207]  We had riots in different states and friggin' cities being burnt down.
[01:28:23.587 --> 01:28:26.469]  And then after that, they had the whole defund the police movement.
[01:28:26.849 --> 01:28:27.350]  Who the hell?
[01:28:27.410 --> 01:28:28.670]  Why would you defund the police?
[01:28:28.871 --> 01:28:32.893]  So they can replace them with private military contractors from places like Bosnia?
[01:28:33.394 --> 01:28:36.496]  Actual killers that have no tie to the community?
[01:28:36.796 --> 01:28:38.777]  No friends and family within the community?
[01:28:39.037 --> 01:28:41.319]  Is that what you want your police force to be consisting of?
[01:28:41.899 --> 01:28:46.282]  A Homeland Security force that's only loyal to the government and has no ties to the community?
[01:28:46.302 --> 01:28:47.283]  Let me say that one more time.
[01:28:47.723 --> 01:28:50.064]  So no, support your police, back the blue.
[01:28:50.284 --> 01:28:53.406]  Yes, there's some bad apples in there, but you need them on your side.
[01:28:53.466 --> 01:28:55.808]  They are our last line of defense against this tyranny.
[01:28:56.188 --> 01:29:02.632]  And above all, most of them, out of 10 policemen, there's more people woke in the police force than out of the 10 normal people.
[01:29:02.652 --> 01:29:05.694]  And that's why they're saying they're purging the police of the white supremacists.
[01:29:05.974 --> 01:29:06.514]  It's the opposite.
[01:29:06.534 --> 01:29:08.536]  They're purging the police of the pro-humans.
[01:29:09.477 --> 01:29:09.918]  Exactly.
[01:29:09.938 --> 01:29:14.042]  Because a lot of police officers became police officers because they want to help people.
[01:29:14.382 --> 01:29:15.523]  And they want to protect people.
[01:29:15.884 --> 01:29:21.109]  And the entire agenda now is 100% anti-human, as Alex has pointed out multiple times.
[01:29:21.410 --> 01:29:24.653]  So they want to put people in place that will just follow orders.
[01:29:24.953 --> 01:29:27.674]  People that are sadistic, a little bit psychopathic even.
[01:29:27.694 --> 01:29:28.874]  What's crazy is the U.N.
[01:29:28.934 --> 01:29:32.095]  runs giant... I mean I read like New York Times articles like, the U.N.
[01:29:32.135 --> 01:29:35.236]  helped exterminate an entire village because they wouldn't do a carbon sink.
[01:29:35.376 --> 01:29:36.736]  It's like a little footnote of the U.N.
[01:29:36.776 --> 01:29:37.517]  murder by emberman.
[01:29:37.537 --> 01:29:38.157]  It's like a good thing.
[01:29:38.457 --> 01:29:39.777]  And like, oh the U.N.'
[01:29:39.757 --> 01:29:41.478]  's fighting for black people in America.
[01:29:41.538 --> 01:29:41.998]  No they're not.
[01:29:42.867 --> 01:29:43.588]  Not even close.
[01:29:43.868 --> 01:29:50.934]  Just like they're fighting for black people in Canada, they're pushing for black people, specifically black people of all races, to get the vaccine.
[01:29:50.954 --> 01:29:51.815]  Yeah, let's talk about that.
[01:29:51.835 --> 01:29:58.701]  All over the world it's like, we need to not be racist and give the blacks their shot first, and then statistics show it's hurting black people worse.
[01:29:58.921 --> 01:29:59.722]  What's going on there?
[01:30:00.442 --> 01:30:02.224]  Yes, that's what I was just about to point out.
[01:30:02.444 --> 01:30:07.869]  First of all, the COVID vaccine, especially the ones with the mRNA from Pfizer and Moderna,
[01:30:08.365 --> 01:30:15.487]  Are the number one highest reported side effect of any vaccine ever, which makes sense because they haven't been approved.
[01:30:15.527 --> 01:30:31.433]  In the United States, they have EUA, Emergency Use Authorization, and in Canada, they call it EUL, Emergency Use Listing, which means they just got a WHO bureaucrat to sign an affidavit stating that he believes that the side effects that they haven't tested for
[01:30:31.877 --> 01:30:35.239]  Are still gonna be less deadly than if you don't take the vaccine at all.
[01:30:35.639 --> 01:30:41.342]  So we're using an experimental, never before used vaccine with weird technology that's never been used before on humans.
[01:30:41.682 --> 01:30:43.543]  And it's not even fully approved.
[01:30:43.843 --> 01:30:47.165]  And that's why you're seeing more side effects being reported than any other vaccine.
[01:30:47.185 --> 01:30:47.925]  And what do they tell you?
[01:30:48.406 --> 01:30:50.807]  Black people, get your shot as soon as possible.
[01:30:51.451 --> 01:30:52.292]  It's disgusting.
[01:30:53.372 --> 01:30:55.013]  And what did Bill Gates' dad do?
[01:30:55.393 --> 01:30:57.715]  He's the director of Planned Parenthood.
[01:30:57.995 --> 01:31:03.058]  So his dad's job was killing as many babies before they could be born as possible.
[01:31:03.078 --> 01:31:05.339]  We're not virtue signaling when we say this.
[01:31:05.399 --> 01:31:06.320]  Black folks need to know.
[01:31:06.780 --> 01:31:11.103]  Planned Parenthood was set up to buy off black preachers to kill black babies. 100%.
[01:31:14.184 --> 01:31:23.909]  Margaret Sanger, Bill Gates' dad, people like that are the ones who started Planned Parenthood, and specifically as a eugenics program to target racialized communities.
[01:31:24.410 --> 01:31:28.312]  And then they realized there's money in just killing babies in general and selling their body parts.
[01:31:28.392 --> 01:31:34.455]  And then I watch some of these black males in New York, wherever, killing white people, and they'll say, well, it's a white person, they're bad.
[01:31:34.855 --> 01:31:39.418]  I'm not saying they should go kill Bill Gates, I'm just saying, kill an old white lady, she ain't attacking black people.
[01:31:39.938 --> 01:31:42.722]  But, you know, but let me tell you, Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates are.
[01:31:42.742 --> 01:31:55.718]  I mean, you know, it's like how do you to watch black people, not a small minority of them, but are brainwashed now to attack white people believing this and that the actual Nazis are training them to do it, to turn white people into racists.
[01:31:55.999 --> 01:31:57.521]  I mean, you see how they're trying to cause a race war.
[01:31:59.112 --> 01:32:03.215]  100%!
[01:31:59.332 --> 01:32:03.215]  I just said that was one of the main forms of division, which is with race.
[01:32:03.415 --> 01:32:04.836]  But in Canada, that's not working.
[01:32:05.076 --> 01:32:08.799]  In Canada, the black community knows they're part of the community just like everyone else.
[01:32:09.059 --> 01:32:11.161]  We don't look at black, white, different races.
[01:32:11.201 --> 01:32:13.623]  We look at Canadians, and that's it.
[01:32:13.963 --> 01:32:15.264]  Canadians have always been like that.
[01:32:15.304 --> 01:32:18.046]  So when they try that over in Canada, we basically laugh it off.
[01:32:18.427 --> 01:32:20.368]  You didn't see any riots in Canada.
[01:32:20.388 --> 01:32:22.330]  You don't see any racialized crimes in Canada.
[01:32:22.630 --> 01:32:25.372]  They even had, after the George Floyd incident,
[01:32:25.925 --> 01:32:35.068]  Literally within three or four days of that incident, there was an incident of a black woman who fell from her balcony and died while the police were at her condo.
[01:32:35.408 --> 01:32:38.749]  So they tried to turn that into the Canadian George Floyd incident.
[01:32:39.009 --> 01:32:41.390]  They had GoFundMes, which got almost $400,000.
[01:32:41.450 --> 01:32:46.091]  They had huge protests that were completely endorsed by the media.
[01:32:46.371 --> 01:32:48.272]  You're not allowed to protest in Canada!
[01:32:48.872 --> 01:32:52.816]  Unless, unless you're BLM protesting against racism.
[01:32:53.156 --> 01:33:01.363]  And they came up with the rationalization that racism is a bigger threat than COVID, so that's why it was allowed.
[01:33:01.564 --> 01:33:05.747]  Allowed to the point where Justin Trudeau even marched with BLM.
[01:33:06.608 --> 01:33:08.370]  Sure, well, they went further in the U.S.
[01:33:08.410 --> 01:33:12.674]  They said all the giant BLM rallies, millions of people, hurt COVID.
[01:33:12.714 --> 01:33:13.795]  They said, oh, these crowds
[01:33:14.889 --> 01:33:15.730]  It's totally fake.
[01:33:16.070 --> 01:33:17.191]  I'm for all protests.
[01:33:17.251 --> 01:33:17.751]  I'm for all of it.
[01:33:18.131 --> 01:33:18.452]  All right.
[01:33:18.492 --> 01:33:33.482]  Well, listen, Chris Sky, backtowork.bz, Instagram, Real Chris Sky, Twitter, Chris, S-A-C-C-O-C-C-I-A-1, getmad.online, backtowork.biz.
[01:33:33.863 --> 01:33:35.524]  You're trying to fire businesses back up.
[01:33:35.564 --> 01:33:36.545]  You're really taking action.
[01:33:36.945 --> 01:33:39.447]  And I want to thank you for spending so much time with us today.
[01:33:40.327 --> 01:33:42.149]  Any other points you'd like to make in the next few minutes?
[01:33:43.154 --> 01:33:45.475]  Honestly, I try to tell everybody this.
[01:33:46.096 --> 01:33:47.697]  Do not get frustrated.
[01:33:47.797 --> 01:33:48.958]  Do not get angry.
[01:33:49.058 --> 01:33:50.558]  Do not feel despair.
[01:33:50.598 --> 01:33:51.499]  You have to be happy.
[01:33:51.519 --> 01:33:52.380]  You have to be hopeful.
[01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:58.243]  You have to realize that we've already poked holes in the dam and people are rising up and the time is limited.
[01:33:58.603 --> 01:34:02.366]  When you see someone in a mask and they're giving you attitude, show them compassion.
[01:34:02.726 --> 01:34:04.667]  Understand that they're like a scared
[01:34:05.071 --> 01:34:06.552]  Child and they don't know what to do.
[01:34:06.832 --> 01:34:10.193]  So giving them anger, giving them that oppression does not going to help.
[01:34:10.653 --> 01:34:16.055]  When I changed my, when I changed my attitude towards them and told them, I'm really here trying to help you more and more.
[01:34:16.335 --> 01:34:21.377]  I started having people wearing masks coming up to me and saying, thank you, rather than F you.
[01:34:21.817 --> 01:34:22.217]  No, I agree.
[01:34:22.237 --> 01:34:24.558]  Cause I have a tendency when they threaten me to go, I'll beat your ass.
[01:34:24.838 --> 01:34:26.258]  Instead just say, listen, I understand.
[01:34:26.278 --> 01:34:27.779]  I go, it's the great reset.
[01:34:27.859 --> 01:34:28.639]  It's never going to end.
[01:34:28.719 --> 01:34:29.499]  I care about you.
[01:34:29.839 --> 01:34:31.500]  And they'll start, they'll start crying actually.
[01:34:32.281 --> 01:34:34.622]  That's right, because really, they're just terrified.
[01:34:34.882 --> 01:34:35.983]  They're acting out like that.
[01:34:36.043 --> 01:34:40.565]  They're being like that because they're simply, they're psychologically attacked.
[01:34:40.825 --> 01:34:43.126]  This is psychological warfare right now, people.
[01:34:43.546 --> 01:34:48.648]  It's psychological warfare to make you literally kill yourself.
[01:34:48.748 --> 01:34:54.371]  First, give up your rights and freedoms so you're completely controlled, and then by that point, you're not going to be able to fight back if you even want to.
[01:34:54.391 --> 01:34:57.632]  And decide you're dirty and bad, decide you're obsolete, you're non-essential.
[01:34:58.693 --> 01:35:01.534]  Think about the psyop of saying you are non-essential.
[01:35:02.418 --> 01:35:02.618]  Yes.
[01:35:02.718 --> 01:35:08.404]  And they even came up with these bracelets, these work bracelets now that they've given over two million dollars to the company who created them.
[01:35:08.745 --> 01:35:15.552]  That will literally, first of all, the amount of temperature and stuff, and then they will literally beep if you come within six feet of another person.
[01:35:15.912 --> 01:35:18.435]  They literally are trying to keep you apart from people.
[01:35:18.755 --> 01:35:23.520]  On our subways in Canada, there's a graphic and it shows two people sitting
[01:35:24.268 --> 01:35:29.010]  Oh yeah, in the UK they have billboards up saying, look away from people when you walk down the street.
[01:35:29.030 --> 01:35:30.271]  This is literal cult brainwashing.
[01:35:52.179 --> 01:36:01.172]  Yep, and in BC, Canada, they were running articles praising China for its one-child policy and running ad campaigns and bus shows.
[01:36:01.213 --> 01:36:03.636]  I'm going to stop, because I interrupt because you're so on target.
[01:36:03.977 --> 01:36:07.642]  You've got 10 minutes to run, and I'm going to be listening, but I'm also going to take a piss.
[01:36:08.430 --> 01:36:10.891]  This is a commercial-free Saturday, special transmission with Chris Gray.
[01:36:11.211 --> 01:36:16.452]  We've got about 10 minutes left, so I've got to end this, then finish up with the report, and then I'll get this out.
[01:36:16.492 --> 01:36:17.673]  But just, you're on fire.
[01:36:17.733 --> 01:36:19.253]  Just keep preaching it, brother.
[01:36:19.553 --> 01:36:21.574]  Tell us about One Child Policy China, all this.
[01:36:21.614 --> 01:36:22.034]  Knock it out.
[01:36:22.854 --> 01:36:23.454]  No problem.
[01:36:23.774 --> 01:36:35.337]  So, like we've already established, like you show with the clip, Justin Trudeau has a wonderful admiration for China, and particularly their dictatorship, because that way they can make the citizens do whatever they want, and the citizens can't say anything.
[01:36:35.637 --> 01:36:37.758]  And that's what Justin's been enjoying during this pandemic.
[01:36:38.123 --> 01:36:50.327]  Making all these policies without Parliament, without the approval of his people, and they literally... If I tried to make a billboard that was that offensive, that wasn't part of the narrative, it would get taken down, I would get vilified.
[01:36:50.567 --> 01:36:58.170]  But this company is being given prime real estate to put these billboards up telling Canadians that you're selfish if you have more than one child.
[01:36:58.772 --> 01:37:00.633]  That you need to only have more than one child.
[01:37:00.673 --> 01:37:02.914]  That our country can't survive unless you have more than one child.
[01:37:03.274 --> 01:37:21.881]  Meanwhile, they're bringing in 300,000 so-called refugees per year from all over the world, and these people are given money, they're given homes, they're given jobs, and you're telling actual Canadians born here that they can't have more than one child, or they're selfish.
[01:37:22.201 --> 01:37:28.563]  You're telling Canadians here, if they stand up for your rights, that not only are you selfish, but you're a murderer, you're a grandma killer.
[01:37:29.093 --> 01:37:30.453]  People, you have to stop listening.
[01:37:30.653 --> 01:37:32.314]  You have to stop listening to the TV.
[01:37:32.614 --> 01:37:37.476]  There was a meme that I tried to post on Facebook that said, you want COVID to end.
[01:37:37.656 --> 01:37:41.237]  And it showed a man with his TV and he throws it out the window.
[01:37:41.717 --> 01:37:42.217]  Guess what?
[01:37:43.077 --> 01:37:48.479]  That meme got taken down Facebook and Instagram as harmful misinformation.
[01:37:48.579 --> 01:37:48.879]  Why?
[01:37:49.219 --> 01:37:53.881]  Because they know if you stop watching the TV, that their lies won't get to you.
[01:37:54.141 --> 01:37:58.222]  The only way somebody can be brainwashed and programmed as you have been,
[01:37:58.737 --> 01:38:00.883]  Is first you have to traumatize them, which they did.
[01:38:00.923 --> 01:38:03.270]  They told you you're gonna die from this scary virus.
[01:38:03.888 --> 01:38:12.154]  Then they have to repeat the same lie over and over from as many different platforms as possible so you hear nothing but that lie.
[01:38:12.454 --> 01:38:13.154]  So what do they want?
[01:38:13.254 --> 01:38:26.023]  They want you stuck at home with nothing to do but turn on the TV and watch their fear porn and propaganda so you are so paralyzed by fear that you will sit there and just be waiting to be told what to do.
[01:38:26.383 --> 01:38:27.604]  And that's why I created Get Mad.
[01:38:29.085 --> 01:38:32.226]  Mad, the nonprofit, Mothers Against Distancing.
[01:38:32.406 --> 01:38:36.527]  Because the number one way to wake up people is to use their children.
[01:38:36.807 --> 01:38:51.570]  And when you show a mother that their children are at risk for the rest of their life from psychological and physiological trauma that's going to hamper their mental development forever, that mama turns into a fierce fighter.
[01:38:51.830 --> 01:38:53.370]  And she will not want that for her kids.
[01:38:53.570 --> 01:38:55.130]  And that's why we created Get Mad.
[01:38:55.150 --> 01:38:57.971]  And that's why we told everybody, rather than be afraid,
[01:38:58.410 --> 01:39:02.193]  Rather than be scared and paralyzed, get mad.
[01:39:02.513 --> 01:39:02.853]  Why?
[01:39:02.873 --> 01:39:05.915]  Because when you're mad, you will stand up for yourself.
[01:39:06.275 --> 01:39:08.477]  When you're mad, you will act.
[01:39:08.697 --> 01:39:16.162]  And you will act in your own best interest, not acting against your own best interest as the government has been forcing you to.
[01:39:16.622 --> 01:39:28.250]  The more and more the government can force you to do something you know is wrong, every single time you do something that you, in your heart, know is wrong, they have weakened you.
[01:39:28.815 --> 01:39:31.377]  Mentally, physically, spiritually.
[01:39:31.598 --> 01:39:41.166]  They have taken a little bit of your self-respect and they've made it that much easier to make you not only do that again, but do something even more against your own best interest.
[01:39:41.505 --> 01:39:43.506]  It started with wearing a mask.
[01:39:43.747 --> 01:39:47.429]  Then it goes on to now you have to give up your details everywhere you go.
[01:39:47.509 --> 01:39:54.033]  So if somebody happened to be where you were and had COVID, now they can lock you up for two weeks and call you a potential COVID threat.
[01:39:54.394 --> 01:39:56.075]  Then they want you to take the vaccine.
[01:39:56.275 --> 01:40:00.057]  Then they want you to keep your business closed until you get bankrupt.
[01:40:00.157 --> 01:40:00.578]  Why?
[01:40:00.598 --> 01:40:02.759]  For the greater good.
[01:40:02.919 --> 01:40:03.960]  Their greater good.
[01:40:04.380 --> 01:40:06.902]  We had a politician named Roman Baber
[01:40:07.312 --> 01:40:07.912]  We're good to go.
[01:40:30.626 --> 01:40:33.687]  Between $1,600 and $2,000 a month.
[01:40:34.207 --> 01:40:36.088]  And that's what they want these people to live on.
[01:40:36.228 --> 01:40:41.530]  Total domestication, then you got to take the vaccines, send your kids where they want, sterilize yourself.
[01:40:42.010 --> 01:40:43.951]  This is the authoritarian revolution.
[01:40:43.971 --> 01:40:46.532]  Well, listen, Chris Sky, I'm impressed.
[01:40:46.792 --> 01:40:47.752]  I'm impressed with your work.
[01:40:47.772 --> 01:40:49.313]  I want to talk about you in closing a little bit.
[01:40:49.733 --> 01:40:55.317]  I know you said you've been listening since you were 14 years old, so I'm proud of the fact that so many great activists, you know, helped get their start here.
[01:40:55.357 --> 01:40:58.379]  But your parents, who you are, because you're really a well-spoken guy.
[01:40:58.399 --> 01:40:59.139]  You really get it.
[01:40:59.499 --> 01:41:00.180]  You're positive.
[01:41:00.200 --> 01:41:02.201]  You're a real leader, and I want everybody to recognize that.
[01:41:02.521 --> 01:41:03.882]  I mean, tell people a little bit more about yourself.
[01:41:05.063 --> 01:41:07.224]  Oh, well, I'm the only son.
[01:41:07.244 --> 01:41:08.185]  I have two sisters.
[01:41:08.225 --> 01:41:09.666]  They're both older, so I'm the only son.
[01:41:09.686 --> 01:41:10.326]  I'm the baby.
[01:41:10.606 --> 01:41:12.507]  My parents, actually, they're both Italian.
[01:41:12.968 --> 01:41:17.491]  One was born in Canada, one was born in Italy, and they actually met when they were 13 years old.
[01:41:18.544 --> 01:41:19.104]  They're now 67.
[01:41:19.345 --> 01:41:21.066]  They've been together this whole time.
[01:41:22.067 --> 01:41:26.591]  I work in the construction industry in the residential, low-rise, develop, design, and build.
[01:41:27.131 --> 01:41:30.314]  And so I've been working with government since I was about 18 years old.
[01:41:30.434 --> 01:41:31.915]  So you're a hard-working businessman.
[01:41:31.935 --> 01:41:33.617]  That's why you're smart, because you live in the real world.
[01:41:34.707 --> 01:41:35.667]  Well, I live in the private sector.
[01:41:35.687 --> 01:41:40.668]  You deal with people, you deal with customers, you deal with government, you deal... I deal with everybody, exactly.
[01:41:40.909 --> 01:41:41.929]  You hit the nail on the head.
[01:41:42.009 --> 01:41:53.872]  That's why I'm good at communicating, because I have to deal with everyone from owners of construction companies, the workers at those companies, people who purchase houses from us, lawyers, engineers, architects, everyone who works with the city.
[01:41:53.892 --> 01:41:55.612]  And that's why Klaus Schwab and them are going to lose.
[01:41:55.632 --> 01:41:57.293]  They're up there at the top playing God.
[01:41:57.573 --> 01:41:58.773]  We're down here at the ground level.
[01:41:59.790 --> 01:42:02.631]  Yeah, and we're on the ground and we're fighting and we're digging in.
[01:42:02.671 --> 01:42:07.674]  And like, I can tell you, I've been dealing with the government just in business since I was 18 years old.
[01:42:08.114 --> 01:42:12.916]  And the government only understands two things, leverage and force.
[01:42:13.456 --> 01:42:19.899]  And they will employ both of those upon you to the extent that you allow.
[01:42:19.919 --> 01:42:21.220]  Let me say that again.
[01:42:21.740 --> 01:42:25.582]  Everything that's happening right now, Americans, Canadians,
[01:42:26.226 --> 01:42:29.367]  Look at yourselves in the mirror and say, I am responsible.
[01:42:29.727 --> 01:42:30.067]  I agree.
[01:42:30.087 --> 01:42:32.848]  When I show this video, this is the, this is the secret.
[01:42:32.868 --> 01:42:34.269]  This is the medical secret police.
[01:42:34.669 --> 01:42:36.109]  Cause it wasn't guys in black uniforms.
[01:42:36.129 --> 01:42:39.150]  Everybody would rise up and fight them, but they come in blue, light blue.
[01:42:39.350 --> 01:42:39.910]  Oh, it's okay.
[01:42:40.050 --> 01:42:40.671]  I called both.
[01:42:40.931 --> 01:42:43.872]  I called those people because I had done a PCR test there.
[01:42:43.952 --> 01:42:45.332]  Cause I was in Turkey, Istanbul.
[01:42:45.352 --> 01:42:46.012]  That's where that was.
[01:42:46.553 --> 01:42:48.533]  And I needed to do a PCR test to come home.
[01:42:48.873 --> 01:42:51.814]  And normally I would take the saliva PCR test where you spit in a cup.
[01:42:51.834 --> 01:42:54.075]  Cause it's non-invasive and they ain't touching me with anything.
[01:42:54.500 --> 01:42:56.040]  But in Turkey, that was not available.
[01:42:56.200 --> 01:42:58.321]  So I had to get a throat swab PCR.
[01:42:58.601 --> 01:43:01.922]  So I called a company that comes to your hotel and they do it right there.
[01:43:02.222 --> 01:43:08.203]  And this guy stuck, it looked like a normal Q-tip and I've gotten many throat swabs before, but as soon as he touched me with it, I felt weird.
[01:43:08.483 --> 01:43:10.763]  And within two minutes, it felt like a lump in my throat.
[01:43:10.783 --> 01:43:15.144]  So I ran up to my room, I shined a flashlight down there and I could see a blister forming.
[01:43:15.404 --> 01:43:16.745]  So at that point, I freaked out.
[01:43:17.045 --> 01:43:18.605]  I found a private medical clinic.
[01:43:18.905 --> 01:43:21.305]  I got the hotel to call them and call them to my room.
[01:43:21.326 --> 01:43:23.686]  And that's the two people you see in the two blue hazmat suits.
[01:43:23.991 --> 01:43:29.935]  And then I had a person from the hotel come in to translate for me because I don't really speak Turkish and tell me exactly what's going on.
[01:43:29.955 --> 01:43:34.078]  Let me find out what happened next, but they said a lot of the tests, the Chinese contaminated.
[01:43:34.378 --> 01:43:36.860]  This is a perfect way to launch an attack doing this as well.
[01:43:37.100 --> 01:43:37.880]  So what really happened?
[01:43:38.781 --> 01:43:39.181]  Of course.
[01:43:39.561 --> 01:43:43.604]  Well, I got, I felt kind of woozy and sick for the last, for the few days after that.
[01:43:43.744 --> 01:43:46.246]  I tested negative for COVID, so they allowed me to fly home.
[01:43:46.406 --> 01:43:47.567]  So what do you think they hit you with?
[01:43:48.652 --> 01:43:50.193]  To be honest, I have no idea.
[01:43:50.233 --> 01:43:56.875]  I've seen some terrifying videos where a woman takes a normal Q-tip and one of these covid swabs and she takes a pair of tweezers.
[01:43:56.895 --> 01:44:01.937]  She rips some fibers off the Q-tip and you see just normal white Q-tip fibers, nothing wrong.
[01:44:02.177 --> 01:44:05.258]  And then she rips the fibers off of one of those covid swabs right there.
[01:44:05.738 --> 01:44:11.840]  And when she's filming it, they look about silver and shiny and they don't look like normal cotton wool Q-tips.
[01:44:11.860 --> 01:44:12.921]  They look like something else.
[01:44:13.441 --> 01:44:14.261]  And then you see the
[01:44:17.307 --> 01:44:18.868]  And interacting with each other.
[01:44:19.549 --> 01:44:21.550]  And at first you think it's maybe it's just something else.
[01:44:21.570 --> 01:44:23.552]  So they're putting alien babies in our heads?
[01:44:23.572 --> 01:44:24.652]  I mean, that's what I'm saying.
[01:44:25.013 --> 01:44:29.816]  Like, Klaus Schwab's in a Klingon outfit going, we're going to change you inside your body.
[01:44:30.176 --> 01:44:31.577]  And it's a vaccine that changed your DNA.
[01:44:31.637 --> 01:44:33.139]  And like, that's what I'm saying, man.
[01:44:33.179 --> 01:44:33.859]  Something weird.
[01:44:34.119 --> 01:44:39.923]  Because I'm not an alien guy, but as a smart intellectual or a guy that analyzes, it all just feels like an alien attack.
[01:44:40.324 --> 01:44:41.785]  I know we don't want to speculate, but yeah.
[01:44:42.768 --> 01:44:56.572]  I don't like I don't like speculating, but I can tell you 100 percent guarantee that there's something on those swabs, whether it's smart dust, nanotechnology, whether it's some kind of contaminant, whether it's just some kind of preservative that causes a reaction.
[01:44:56.832 --> 01:44:58.072]  There is something on there.
[01:44:58.152 --> 01:45:02.253]  It's not just a normal Q tip like they would use, like you would use to clean your ears.
[01:45:02.453 --> 01:45:05.974]  Because I've used Q tips for my entire life and I've never got a reaction.
[01:45:06.334 --> 01:45:08.275]  And this thing gave me a nasty reaction.
[01:45:08.335 --> 01:45:09.075]  It wasn't a scrape.
[01:45:09.451 --> 01:45:12.713]  They looked at it, they acknowledged on film that it was a reaction.
[01:45:12.733 --> 01:45:15.795]  So then when I said, what the hell is on there that gave that reaction?
[01:45:16.055 --> 01:45:19.097]  They tried to backtrack and say, oh, well, a lot of people get that reaction.
[01:45:19.137 --> 01:45:20.838]  Well, let me tell you, let me tell you.
[01:45:22.178 --> 01:45:27.701]  I talk about my dad, he can't stand it when I do it, but they tried to recruit him in high school because he was like top of his class.
[01:45:27.741 --> 01:45:29.923]  He was working at MD Anderson when he was 16 and Plan 2 UT.
[01:45:32.691 --> 01:45:37.112]  And they, they tried to recruit him in by the time he graduated high school into eugenics and world government.
[01:45:37.472 --> 01:45:42.173]  He didn't tell me about it until I made end game like 14 years ago, my mom was watching it before it came out.
[01:45:42.333 --> 01:45:43.554]  And she said, David, is this true?
[01:45:43.574 --> 01:45:45.034]  And he said, yeah, it's all true.
[01:45:45.054 --> 01:45:47.895]  And he kind of spilled his guts there, but my dad wasn't that special.
[01:45:48.415 --> 01:45:54.436]  They got all the top people he knew and they all went literally into underground bases in the eighties.
[01:45:54.476 --> 01:45:56.337]  He didn't join it and they never came out.
[01:45:57.304 --> 01:46:00.285]  So I'm just saying, this is a giant scientific takeover.
[01:46:00.585 --> 01:46:03.286]  So folks, as bad as we think it is, it's way worse than we know.
[01:46:03.626 --> 01:46:06.847]  And I'm not trying to scare people, I'm just telling you, this is biblical.
[01:46:07.827 --> 01:46:16.069]  The truth, when you finally chase it down, is almost always far worse than your darkest visions or fears.
[01:46:16.769 --> 01:46:17.429]  Harry Truman.
[01:46:18.130 --> 01:46:22.631]  And after a guy that dropped two atomic bombs says something like that, you better believe it.
[01:46:23.462 --> 01:46:24.303]  That's all I gotta tell you.
[01:46:24.323 --> 01:46:25.264]  Powerfully said.
[01:46:25.344 --> 01:46:26.885]  Alright, Chris Sky, we love you.
[01:46:27.425 --> 01:46:28.046]  I love what you're doing.
[01:46:28.066 --> 01:46:31.008]  I already saw your videos six months ago, but it's just so good to have you.
[01:46:31.389 --> 01:46:32.590]  Thank you for all the time today.
[01:46:32.630 --> 01:46:34.411]  How long are you on house arrest?
[01:46:35.432 --> 01:46:43.779]  I'm on house arrest until March 7th, and I'm gonna be flying out March 8th for some international travel, and I'll be coming back and making sure that I do not go
[01:46:44.324 --> 01:46:44.944]  I don't know.
[01:47:04.617 --> 01:47:07.699]  Uh, but they consider me some kind of danger some way or the other.
[01:47:07.759 --> 01:47:08.520]  I have no idea.
[01:47:08.900 --> 01:47:12.963]  So, but one way or the other, I'm going to come down there because we need to talk to the U.S.
[01:47:13.003 --> 01:47:14.404]  We need to unite Canada and the U.S.
[01:47:14.424 --> 01:47:14.824]  together.
[01:47:15.364 --> 01:47:19.047]  And I want to talk about the Republican Party of Canada that nobody knows about.
[01:47:19.387 --> 01:47:21.709]  And it's going to be coming out and it's going to be coming out strong.
[01:47:21.749 --> 01:47:23.070]  It's going to be very well funded.
[01:47:23.110 --> 01:47:26.512]  And the man who's leading it is the kind of man we need to end this kind of problem.
[01:47:26.812 --> 01:47:26.992]  All right.
[01:47:27.012 --> 01:47:27.452]  Amazing.
[01:47:27.512 --> 01:47:31.975]  Chris Sky, you can find him at backtowork.bz and getmad.online.
[01:47:31.995 --> 01:47:32.376]  Thank you, sir.
[01:47:33.390 --> 01:47:33.990]  Thank you guys.
[01:47:34.010 --> 01:47:35.311]  I can't wait to do more with you.
[01:47:35.832 --> 01:47:36.232]  Can't wait.
[01:47:36.812 --> 01:47:39.494]  Well, that was a powerful hour plus interview.
[01:47:39.694 --> 01:47:40.054]  Wow.
[01:47:41.295 --> 01:47:41.955]  Oh, man.
[01:47:42.075 --> 01:47:46.318]  I mean, I am in the twilight zone and people are like, Jones, you told us this was all coming.
[01:47:46.478 --> 01:47:47.279]  How are you handling it?
[01:47:47.559 --> 01:47:48.539]  I can't even believe it.
[01:47:48.639 --> 01:47:49.840]  It's like it's happening.
[01:47:50.501 --> 01:47:52.242]  We're inside the new world order.
[01:47:52.802 --> 01:47:58.205]  We're inside world government with crazy people running it that said they want to kill everybody.
[01:47:58.846 --> 01:48:00.827]  It should be so easy to beat this, but I get it.
[01:48:02.452 --> 01:48:06.595]  The average person scared and they don't want to admit this is happening.
[01:48:07.255 --> 01:48:08.116]  I talk about my dad.
[01:48:08.476 --> 01:48:20.125]  He didn't tell me this till 14 years ago sitting in my office with a big screen TV showing the film in game and they watched the film.
[01:48:21.257 --> 01:48:23.037]  My mother said, David, this can't be true.
[01:48:23.057 --> 01:48:24.658]  And he said, no, it's true.
[01:48:24.718 --> 01:48:28.259]  And in the car, going to the ballet recital, he talked about what he went through.
[01:48:28.599 --> 01:48:29.459]  But I already knew this.
[01:48:29.479 --> 01:48:30.239]  I have the documents.
[01:48:30.259 --> 01:48:30.900]  I have the witnesses.
[01:48:30.920 --> 01:48:31.240]  I have it all.
[01:48:31.460 --> 01:48:35.921]  But my own dad, I didn't know they tried to recruit until that moment.
[01:48:36.701 --> 01:48:37.982]  That's how big this is, folks.
[01:48:39.662 --> 01:48:42.303]  And yeah, we've got about 300 in-games left.
[01:48:42.483 --> 01:48:43.663]  I don't know if they're ever going to reprint it.
[01:48:43.683 --> 01:48:44.723]  We print them in Chicago.
[01:48:45.424 --> 01:48:47.124]  It's good to have this on your shelf.
[01:48:47.284 --> 01:48:48.204]  You should download it.
[01:48:48.644 --> 01:48:50.485]  You should make copies of it.
[01:48:51.732 --> 01:48:53.874]  Cause the film has a code where you can make copies.
[01:48:54.674 --> 01:48:56.376]  You're like, oh, that's low tech DVD.
[01:48:56.736 --> 01:48:58.658]  In the future, everything's going to be low tech.
[01:48:59.418 --> 01:49:01.380]  There's a few hundred copies of these left.
[01:49:02.441 --> 01:49:04.422]  Uh, I'm trying to find a place to actually reprint them.
[01:49:04.462 --> 01:49:06.784]  They said they've lost the original disc or whatever.
[01:49:06.824 --> 01:49:11.308]  So I don't know if we'll ever have it again, but that's how we fund the operation end game.
[01:49:12.649 --> 01:49:15.891]  We're gonna play a three minute video here, um, of.
[01:49:16.932 --> 01:49:21.913]  My not prediction, I was covering Operation Lockstep, but extrapolating what they would do.
[01:49:22.474 --> 01:49:25.494]  And this was again, 11 years ago.
[01:49:25.594 --> 01:49:27.275]  So here is that clip.
[01:49:28.855 --> 01:49:32.416]  I guess that would be, uh, what, what clip would that be?
[01:49:32.436 --> 01:49:34.837]  That would be clip 11.
[01:49:35.457 --> 01:49:35.777]  Yeah.
[01:49:36.457 --> 01:49:38.558]  Alex Jones predicts Operation Lockstep.
[01:49:39.058 --> 01:49:40.258]  Here is that clip.
[01:49:40.718 --> 01:49:42.519]  I'm going to come back and conclude this transmission.
[01:49:43.482 --> 01:49:45.163]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:49:45.343 --> 01:49:47.385]  There is a war on for your mind.
[01:49:47.645 --> 01:49:50.767]  I mean, I'm not even worthy to be bringing you information this powerful.
[01:49:51.387 --> 01:49:54.849]  And I hope that you pay attention to what we cover here, minute by minute.
[01:49:56.250 --> 01:49:59.032]  Because I've had chills since last night.
[01:50:00.533 --> 01:50:03.295]  This just confirms everything else we've already researched.
[01:50:05.560 --> 01:50:16.484]  A Rockefeller study envisions future dictatorship controlled by elite, millions being killed, mandatory quarantines, checkpoints, the end of the family, everything that's in the other documents.
[01:50:16.524 --> 01:50:22.566]  But this dovetails with all the other Rockefeller Foundation documents about the GMO food to sterilize you and the forced vaccines.
[01:50:23.286 --> 01:50:29.148]  The hell we're already living in that's just going to continue to intensify until we take our governments back from these eugenics madmen.
[01:50:29.328 --> 01:50:31.889]  But that story is up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:50:32.089 --> 01:50:35.351]  The question is, will you have the courage to really do the research yourself?
[01:50:35.431 --> 01:50:38.612]  Because I don't want you to just sit here and hear me make these claims.
[01:50:39.372 --> 01:50:50.855]  These people are so arrogant that they write policy papers, so many of them, that they're producing these policy papers and reports and white papers so fast that you could never read them all.
[01:50:51.235 --> 01:50:54.216]  It is an open conspiracy against you and your family.
[01:50:54.636 --> 01:50:59.138]  I pray to God, I pray to my Heavenly Father Jesus Christ every night to give me the strength
[01:50:59.978 --> 01:51:11.586]  And the will to be able to face this horror and to give me the strength to carry on because I know why a lot of you don't want to look at this information and just want to comment on the YouTube videos or on message boards that I'm a liar.
[01:51:13.527 --> 01:51:13.907]  I know why.
[01:51:14.508 --> 01:51:15.609]  Because it's scary.
[01:51:20.052 --> 01:51:21.993]  You're not going to be able to go to the ball games anymore.
[01:51:24.455 --> 01:51:26.776]  You're not going to be able to just go out and get drunk with your friends.
[01:51:26.796 --> 01:51:27.757]  You're not going to be able to just
[01:51:29.275 --> 01:51:31.297]  You know, go out and enjoy yourself all the time.
[01:51:32.497 --> 01:51:55.655]  The only chance we've got of beating this scientific dictatorship, this creeping death that takes its time to incrementally enslave you, mentally, psychologically, physically, spiritually, the only way to defeat it is for the rank and file of this planet to realize that you have a choice to make on what your destiny is going to be.
[01:51:57.293 --> 01:52:02.375]  Once you face this information, once you've consciously admitted it to yourself, it will take over your life.
[01:52:02.775 --> 01:52:04.136]  It should take over your life.
[01:52:04.896 --> 01:52:05.676]  I mean, what else?
[01:52:06.317 --> 01:52:07.237]  What else could it do?
[01:52:09.578 --> 01:52:19.922]  We've got to get past the artificial stigma that the controlled corporate media has been putting out for decades, ahead of their open... of unveiling of planetary dictatorship.
[01:52:21.636 --> 01:52:24.960]  They all talk about how we need a police state to carry this out.
[01:52:25.020 --> 01:52:32.728]  Canada and the United States are going to work in lockstep to display the seriousness of our commitment at both home and abroad.
[01:52:33.008 --> 01:52:36.071]  Win, lose, or draw, you need to choose a side.
[01:52:36.091 --> 01:52:38.694]  InfoWars.
[01:52:39.035 --> 01:52:40.536]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[01:52:44.161 --> 01:52:49.625]  All right, here we are on Saturday evening, and there's nothing I'd rather be doing than be here.
[01:52:49.665 --> 01:52:54.589]  And I want to thank the crew for the great job they're doing tonight covering all of this.
[01:52:55.650 --> 01:53:06.859]  There is a program to depopulate the earth, and you can argue all day, well, maybe there's too many people, and, you know, maybe folks are starving in some areas, so they grow up with not enough foods, they have low IQs, and they're kind of ruined.
[01:53:08.012 --> 01:53:10.753]  But once you get into that mindset, you're done.
[01:53:11.113 --> 01:53:12.313]  Because I've studied the globalists.
[01:53:12.753 --> 01:53:17.034]  They want to get rid of everybody, including the smartest people, because they compete with them.
[01:53:17.694 --> 01:53:20.915]  This is a post-human alien takeover.
[01:53:21.915 --> 01:53:26.996]  I don't know if it's interdimensional, you know, the devil, like the Bible says, whatever you want to call it, it's anti-human.
[01:53:27.456 --> 01:53:33.797]  And my very DNA, my very soul, my very will says, you will not put up with this, Jones.
[01:53:33.917 --> 01:53:34.878]  You will attack this.
[01:53:35.578 --> 01:53:36.358]  You will defeat this.
[01:53:38.370 --> 01:53:43.815]  And I've learned that our enemies that serve this system are slaves.
[01:53:45.457 --> 01:53:46.538]  They are not free.
[01:53:46.638 --> 01:53:47.739]  They are not empowered.
[01:53:47.799 --> 01:53:49.641]  They are not connected to the universe.
[01:53:49.661 --> 01:53:50.521]  They're not connected to God.
[01:53:50.922 --> 01:53:52.083]  So I'm not with them.
[01:53:52.904 --> 01:53:54.445]  I can promise the devil worshipers.
[01:53:55.306 --> 01:54:00.351]  I can promise the Satanists, the Luciferians, all of you, that you have bet on the wrong horse.
[01:54:01.872 --> 01:54:03.492]  And a lot of people made a big deal about this.
[01:54:03.512 --> 01:54:04.893]  You know, it's February 27th now.
[01:54:05.473 --> 01:54:06.573]  This came out last weekend.
[01:54:07.274 --> 01:54:08.854]  What are sperm telling us?
[01:54:09.614 --> 01:54:10.514]  New York Times article.
[01:54:11.455 --> 01:54:15.756]  And it's how the sperm counts are down 50% on average, 90% in the U.S.
[01:54:16.716 --> 01:54:18.277]  Animals can't have babies anymore.
[01:54:18.437 --> 01:54:20.957]  And they say it's the endocrine disrupting chemicals.
[01:54:22.078 --> 01:54:24.518]  They're putting chemicals in the water that make the frogs gay.
[01:54:24.979 --> 01:54:29.780]  But of course I wasn't even telling you something that was avant-garde 20 years ago.
[01:54:31.718 --> 01:54:33.658]  Girls are experiencing early puberty.
[01:54:34.519 --> 01:54:40.260]  Adult women appear to be suffering declining egg quality and more miscarriages.
[01:54:40.980 --> 01:54:44.301]  They estimate soon we won't be able to have children, period.
[01:54:45.701 --> 01:54:46.502]  But it's okay.
[01:54:46.522 --> 01:54:51.343]  We've got LeBron James who supported Communist China death camps.
[01:54:52.563 --> 01:54:54.563]  And then somebody in Europe said, stop being political.
[01:54:54.583 --> 01:54:57.844]  He goes, oh, never shut up about something that's wrong.
[01:54:58.624 --> 01:55:00.545]  You mean all the agreed upon things.
[01:55:01.834 --> 01:55:03.855]  That are safe to say how America sucks.
[01:55:05.236 --> 01:55:07.677]  I wish LeBron James was not such a coward, but I'll tell you.
[01:55:08.257 --> 01:55:09.658]  I wish Tom Brady wasn't such a coward.
[01:55:10.118 --> 01:55:13.660]  Because they're able to dribble a basketball, able to throw a football.
[01:55:15.201 --> 01:55:17.362]  Is nothing compared to doing what's politically right.
[01:55:17.762 --> 01:55:18.302]  So I'll tell you.
[01:55:19.623 --> 01:55:21.004]  Oh, Tom Brady had a Trump hat.
[01:55:21.864 --> 01:55:22.264]  Okay.
[01:55:22.625 --> 01:55:25.226]  He has more courage than LeBron James, but not much more.
[01:55:26.727 --> 01:55:30.669]  Cause I guarantee you, Tom Brady is going to be there in 20, 30 years when he's dying.
[01:55:31.766 --> 01:55:38.534]  When this whole country's gone and the whole world's burning down wishing he'd have done something for his children that don't have a future.
[01:55:38.815 --> 01:55:43.781]  I don't expect anything from LeBron James, a big satanic egomaniac.
[01:55:46.384 --> 01:55:50.409]  But I do expect something from people like Tom Brady.
[01:55:53.063 --> 01:55:53.563]  And I get it.
[01:55:53.684 --> 01:55:54.805]  Tom Brady's a great guy.
[01:55:55.005 --> 01:55:56.846]  Hershel Walker's a great guy out speaking out.
[01:55:57.147 --> 01:55:58.768]  But man, you guys got to go further.
[01:55:59.108 --> 01:56:01.691]  You know, I watch the system run from InfoWars.
[01:56:01.971 --> 01:56:03.652]  You think I want to be embraced by the system?
[01:56:05.073 --> 01:56:06.274]  I want to change the system.
[01:56:06.395 --> 01:56:11.199]  I want to get people to stop caring what the media says and do the right thing.
[01:56:14.036 --> 01:56:17.097]  But LeBron James is so in love with himself because he's a great athlete.
[01:56:17.177 --> 01:56:18.077]  Okay, great, dude.
[01:56:18.457 --> 01:56:22.778]  You can go out on the field, go out on that, go out on that court and beat those other guys.
[01:56:23.418 --> 01:56:24.678]  Whoop-dee-frickin'-doo, man.
[01:56:25.178 --> 01:56:26.698]  What's that gonna mean when there's a nuclear war?
[01:56:28.018 --> 01:56:30.859]  What's that gonna mean when half of us got cancer from the shots?
[01:56:32.019 --> 01:56:33.339]  What's that gonna mean, LeBron James?
[01:56:38.060 --> 01:56:38.320]  All right.
[01:56:41.281 --> 01:56:42.641]  I'm gonna end this transmission.
[01:56:45.694 --> 01:56:49.557]  Because I really, I have a lot more to say, but you know, you just can't say it all.
[01:56:49.737 --> 01:56:56.761]  And then I'll hope tomorrow night I'm back at 4 PM with the Alex Jones Show and then the Sunday Live with Owen Schroer.
[01:56:56.801 --> 01:57:04.747]  But I got a great crew that puts up with me and I've got a great group of affiliates and sponsors and you the listeners, but man, I just want to get this through to everybody.
[01:57:05.327 --> 01:57:07.188]  You understand this is the truth.
[01:57:07.729 --> 01:57:09.470]  Like what we're covering here on air.
[01:57:09.870 --> 01:57:10.551]  This is it.
[01:57:11.231 --> 01:57:12.232]  This isn't a game.
[01:57:12.272 --> 01:57:13.092]  It's not a joke.
[01:57:13.152 --> 01:57:15.454]  It's not some side issue because God's real.
[01:57:16.655 --> 01:57:27.310]  And so God literally rose me up and rose you up and rose everybody up here today to do the thing we're doing now so that you'd have a choice because God is good.
[01:57:28.732 --> 01:57:29.814]  God gives us free will.
[01:57:31.274 --> 01:57:33.655]  To be good or to be evil, God gives us a choice.
[01:57:34.315 --> 01:57:41.759]  But God cheats in that He loves His children and He would make sure that they got warned up front about what's going on.
[01:57:42.119 --> 01:57:51.523]  You think I like, as sinful as I am and as weak as I am, having God every day and every night energize me with so much
[01:57:52.952 --> 01:57:58.201]  Information on this blob, this worm, and I'm like burning with all of it.
[01:57:58.261 --> 01:58:00.084]  I can't even explain it to you.
[01:58:00.345 --> 01:58:03.129]  You've got to get the Holy Spirit before you can even understand it.
[01:58:06.263 --> 01:58:07.384]  I don't want to be a general.
[01:58:07.484 --> 01:58:08.284]  I don't want the money.
[01:58:08.384 --> 01:58:09.265]  I don't want the power.
[01:58:09.345 --> 01:58:10.506]  I'm past it all, man.
[01:58:10.766 --> 01:58:19.772]  Cause I'm literally got God fire breathing truth into me constantly where I know every enemy move, every enemy action, but I'm still a man.
[01:58:20.212 --> 01:58:24.875]  I'm still this pathetic creature blasted by the consciousness of the creator.
[01:58:25.296 --> 01:58:32.661]  And then I see people on their knees to Satan thinking they're going to get power and they're going to get enlightenment.
[01:58:32.701 --> 01:58:35.963]  And they have no idea that Satan's a loser.
[01:58:37.404 --> 01:58:40.006]  And Satan has nothing to offer.
[01:58:40.446 --> 01:58:42.067]  Klaus Schwab is a loser.
[01:58:42.367 --> 01:58:43.588]  Bill Gates is a loser.
[01:58:43.909 --> 01:58:45.129]  Ted Turner's a loser.
[01:58:45.390 --> 01:58:46.891]  Barack Obama's a loser.
[01:58:47.351 --> 01:58:49.593]  Every one of them, look at them, is a loser!
[01:58:51.154 --> 01:58:56.678]  I just want to complete my mission faithfully and get teleported up to God.
[01:58:57.098 --> 01:58:57.879]  That's all I want!
[01:58:59.184 --> 01:59:00.784]  I don't want Hollywood.
[01:59:01.084 --> 01:59:02.585]  I don't want gold.
[01:59:02.945 --> 01:59:04.625]  I don't want any of the accolades.
[01:59:04.965 --> 01:59:17.347]  I want to try to free humanity and complete my mission so big guy don't flush me down the toilet with these people because all I want is away from these devil worshipers.
[01:59:18.328 --> 01:59:19.968]  That's all I want, God.
[01:59:20.308 --> 01:59:21.628]  Get me away from them.
[01:59:22.828 --> 01:59:23.729]  Get me with you.
[01:59:24.129 --> 01:59:25.129]  Get me out of here.
[01:59:26.889 --> 01:59:27.249]  Damn it!
[01:59:27.969 --> 01:59:28.810]  Damn them to hell!
[01:59:29.430 --> 01:59:29.690]  All right.
[01:59:29.750 --> 01:59:30.490]  I appreciate the crew.
[01:59:30.530 --> 01:59:31.010]  Great job.
[01:59:31.310 --> 01:59:32.651]  That's it for this special transmission.
[01:59:32.671 --> 01:59:35.031]  Appreciate them coming in these historic times.
[01:59:35.051 --> 01:59:36.172]  4 p.m.
[01:59:36.212 --> 01:59:37.252]  tomorrow, we should be live.
[01:59:37.572 --> 01:59:38.692]  Thanks for keeping us on the air.
[01:59:39.012 --> 01:59:40.533]  I love you, and I appreciate you all.
[01:59:41.673 --> 01:59:44.134]  And as they say in Looney Tunes, that's all, folks.
