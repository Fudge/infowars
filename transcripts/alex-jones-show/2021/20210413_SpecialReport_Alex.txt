[00:00:00.169 --> 00:00:08.719]  I've got some shocking news that will horrify all freedom-loving Americans and anybody, not just here but around the world, who believes in the freedom of the press.
[00:00:09.159 --> 00:00:19.510]  Sam Montoya, a great video editor and camera person for InfoWars that's been here about three years, was arrested today at his apartment in Austin, Texas.
[00:00:20.371 --> 00:00:25.312]  30 plus FBI agents and federal marshals showed up and knocked down his door with a battering ram.
[00:00:25.332 --> 00:00:26.713]  We have some photos of it.
[00:00:26.753 --> 00:00:29.693]  We got a call from him in jail a few hours ago.
[00:00:29.753 --> 00:00:47.258]  We also have the arrest materials that were left on the counter inside his home with the door knocked open stating that he's under criminal investigation for a conspiracy with others to storm and attack the Capitol and that he's being charged with unlawfully entering the Capitol.
[00:00:48.154 --> 00:00:50.256]  This, again, is truly disgusting.
[00:00:50.296 --> 00:00:54.360]  We've seen the biggest law enforcement investigation in U.S.
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.782]  history, in our own words, carried out.
[00:00:56.122 --> 00:00:58.524]  Over 400 people arrested.
[00:00:59.205 --> 00:01:06.252]  Thousands and thousands and thousands of people visited, including my medical doctor, who I didn't even know went to D.C.
[00:01:06.292 --> 00:01:06.953]  for the Trump rally.
[00:01:07.213 --> 00:01:07.854]  They got a visit.
[00:01:08.454 --> 00:01:10.596]  Many people that didn't even go to D.C.
[00:01:11.457 --> 00:01:13.518]  But our Trump supporters have also gotten visits.
[00:01:14.019 --> 00:01:18.321]  I mean, this is really Soviet-style activity here in America.
[00:01:18.381 --> 00:01:23.184]  But we were able to talk to Sam for a few minutes from jail, where he's been for several hours.
[00:01:23.745 --> 00:01:33.751]  And if the feds follow what they've done in the past, because he is a patriot, he is a Christian, he is a conservative, he will probably serve month after month after month, I guess, until he finally has a trial.
[00:01:34.591 --> 00:01:54.802]  Even though Jaden X, who got $70,000 from CNN and others, went to the Capitol and said, let's burn this mother effer down, Jaden X was released right away after a day in jail and is even allowed to go out and violate the terms of his bail and do interviews, which I think he has a right to do.
[00:01:55.998 --> 00:01:59.999]  But what we're getting at here is this is an attack on InfoWars.
[00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:08.462]  I have talked to a lot of experts about this today since we learned about it, and they agree upon reading the paperwork that it's clearly an attack on InfoWars.
[00:02:08.942 --> 00:02:13.083]  They clearly think they can pressure him, keep him in jail, and have him make up lies about us.
[00:02:13.123 --> 00:02:18.685]  But I know God's real, and I know Sam's a good person, and I know the truth is going to come out.
[00:02:19.185 --> 00:02:32.097]  And I know that the left has taken over the Capitol in Iowa and shot up police stations in just the last few days in Minnesota and burned down buildings in Portland and are calling for police officers to be randomly killed.
[00:02:33.291 --> 00:02:35.392]  And the left is there celebrating it.
[00:02:35.432 --> 00:02:36.472]  The left is there pushing it.
[00:02:36.572 --> 00:02:38.752]  CNN is there instigating it as well.
[00:02:39.333 --> 00:02:55.997]  And that's why if anybody needs to be charged for the Capitol attack, if anybody ran a conspiracy, it was CNN with Jaden X and Anderson Cooper that paid him the $70,000 to go into that Capitol and try to rile people into an event to burn it down.
[00:02:56.037 --> 00:02:59.478]  In his own words, outside the Capitol and inside the Capitol.
[00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:02.819]  Holy!
[00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:04.180]  There's so many people.
[00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:12.243]  Let's burn this shit down.
[00:03:12.704 --> 00:03:15.765]  Well, they already broke the window, so, you know, I didn't know I hit it that hard.
[00:03:16.185 --> 00:03:17.626]  Yeah, no one got that on camera.
[00:03:17.966 --> 00:03:18.866]  What are we doing there?
[00:03:19.346 --> 00:03:19.867]  That's what I'm saying.
[00:03:26.394 --> 00:03:28.018]  Dude, I was trying to tell you.
[00:03:28.038 --> 00:03:29.642]  I couldn't say much.
[00:03:29.662 --> 00:03:31.466]  You were right.
[00:03:31.947 --> 00:03:33.290]  You just have to watch my channel.
[00:03:34.741 --> 00:03:45.485]  And you watch, I predict they're going to keep Sam in jail, like they've done other conservatives, while Jay Nex and other leftists that help actually trick some of the crowd of hundreds of thousands to go into the Capitol.
[00:03:45.946 --> 00:03:49.207]  Remember, most people walked in between the velvet ropes.
[00:03:49.567 --> 00:03:52.148]  They went in after the police stood down and waved them in.
[00:03:52.708 --> 00:03:59.031]  I am all for people that defecated on Nancy Pelosi's desk and folks that attacked police officers to be indicted and to be punished.
[00:03:59.591 --> 00:04:03.417]  But fairly like others are punished for committing similar crimes.
[00:04:03.898 --> 00:04:05.480]  But for the vast majority of people...
[00:04:06.365 --> 00:04:13.949]  That went in, they didn't engage in any type of crime, and they are being politically persecuted and punished for their beliefs.
[00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:30.059]  Plus, you've got the FBI involved in this giant political dragnet, not responding to anti-fund BLM shootings, not responding to buildings being burned down, but saying in the words of Chuckie Schumer, this is the greatest attack on America since Pearl Harbor or 9-11.
[00:04:30.299 --> 00:04:31.320]  And that's just not true.
[00:04:32.609 --> 00:04:35.970]  Four citizens died who were at the Capitol.
[00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.771]  One police officer a few days later of a heart attack and a stroke.
[00:04:39.851 --> 00:04:43.592]  And his family says it was not related to what happened at the Capitol.
[00:04:43.812 --> 00:04:46.453]  But still, it's a sad thing that that happened.
[00:04:46.873 --> 00:04:51.114]  But it does not rise anywhere to the level of Pearl Harbor or 9-11.
[00:04:51.774 --> 00:04:54.195]  And that just shows the hysteria
[00:04:54.835 --> 00:04:58.859]  that the left is involved in in this country to persecute Americans.
[00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:12.873]  So, I know Twitter, I know the Facebook mob, I know all the leftists and the Washington Post and everybody that's just hoping I get indicted and hoping that I get set up for launching an attack on the Capitol are going to be very, very, very pleased about this.
[00:05:12.933 --> 00:05:17.177]  But really, this just shows how authoritarian they all are.
[00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:26.740]  The truth is, I went to be part of a lawful event with President Trump at a Secret Service sanctioned event with fences and porta potties and security.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.181]  Then Trump said, let's march to the Capitol.
[00:05:29.561 --> 00:05:30.841]  I'd been told that was his plan.
[00:05:31.381 --> 00:05:38.063]  And then Trump pulled out because a minority of people, before he ever finished his speech, began to attack police.
[00:05:38.423 --> 00:05:39.343]  The police stood down.
[00:05:39.763 --> 00:05:47.205]  They were outmanned because there'd been an order to send most of them away to do crowd control and traffic control at the Trump event.
[00:05:48.075 --> 00:05:57.162]  And so, with the Capitol undefended, a small minority of people, led by Jaden Nex and others, broke into it with the intent to burn the mother effer down.
[00:05:57.682 --> 00:06:13.374]  But the person saying burn the mother effer down is out on bail, and Sam, who is such a nice, sweet, hardworking person, I mean, out of the hundred people that work at Infowars or so, I have to say he's the nicest, the kindest, the most genuinely Christian person that's here.
[00:06:13.894 --> 00:06:22.542]  I remember after the tragic events of January 6th, I had a chance to talk to Sam and I said, man, are you worried they're going to try to set you up, try to arrest you for covering the Capitol?
[00:06:23.103 --> 00:06:24.844]  And he was like, no, Alex, this is America.
[00:06:24.924 --> 00:06:25.545]  I didn't do anything wrong.
[00:06:25.585 --> 00:06:26.486]  I was just there covering it.
[00:06:26.726 --> 00:06:27.667]  There was other media as well.
[00:06:27.687 --> 00:06:30.570]  And I said, Sam, I hope you're right.
[00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:32.912]  You see, Sam still believes in America.
[00:06:33.552 --> 00:06:34.994]  He still believes in the freedom of the press.
[00:06:35.014 --> 00:06:36.455]  He still believes in the American people.
[00:06:36.975 --> 00:06:37.916]  He still believes in you.
[00:06:38.854 --> 00:06:40.335]  And that's why this fight's so important.
[00:06:40.935 --> 00:06:47.299]  So many other people put their tail between their legs and they grovel to the globalists, and they think if they just submit to the system, everything will be okay.
[00:06:47.899 --> 00:06:53.142]  It's that form of groveling and bowing down to tyranny that's gotten us to the place we are.
[00:06:53.162 --> 00:06:54.823]  That's where she died, folks.
[00:06:54.843 --> 00:06:57.024]  That's where a young woman bled out.
[00:06:57.464 --> 00:07:00.986]  She bled out and died right there in the U.S.
[00:07:01.026 --> 00:07:02.187]  Capitol building.
[00:07:02.227 --> 00:07:04.168]  This is what's happening today.
[00:07:05.949 --> 00:07:10.950]  She had officers standing right behind her that could have grabbed her and just yanked her down and pulled her from the window.
[00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:12.730]  Nobody even tried to do that.
[00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:16.731]  So there was all sorts of mistakes that basically led up to this woman's death.
[00:07:17.011 --> 00:07:19.932]  That's why I'm not just proud to stand with Sam Montoya.
[00:07:20.272 --> 00:07:22.592]  I'm blessed to stand with him and his family.
[00:07:23.272 --> 00:07:24.913]  And with the entire Infowars family.
[00:07:25.233 --> 00:07:26.393]  Because we are a family.
[00:07:27.313 --> 00:07:29.394]  And so now, again, they've arrested him.
[00:07:30.054 --> 00:07:31.594]  He's disappeared into a black hole.
[00:07:33.274 --> 00:07:39.763]  And if they follow the pattern they followed, they will intend to hold him as a political prisoner until they can pressure him to lie.
[00:07:40.264 --> 00:07:50.617]  But again, I trust in God and I believe that justice is going to return to America and if the system wants to try to set me up and I have to be a political martyr for this republic, so be it.
[00:07:51.198 --> 00:07:56.660]  But at the end of the day, the tyrants that have hijacked this country and they're running into the ground will be brought to justice.
[00:07:57.101 --> 00:07:58.961]  America and the world is awakening.
[00:07:59.462 --> 00:08:13.508]  And the globalists with their open borders, smuggling children, the globalists shipping fentanyl into this country, the whole system that's trying to devalue our dollar and sell us out to Communist China is not going to be able to stand and no amount
[00:08:14.048 --> 00:08:15.309]  of political intimidation.
[00:08:15.409 --> 00:08:18.310]  No amount of witch hunts is going to stop that.
[00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:22.832]  But right now, I just ask you all to say a prayer for Sam and his family.
[00:08:22.872 --> 00:08:23.853]  His father was here today.
[00:08:23.913 --> 00:08:25.113]  I talked to him and comforted him.
[00:08:25.693 --> 00:08:32.517]  And just pray for his speedy release and that they drop these false charges because they are completely false.
[00:08:32.877 --> 00:08:34.758]  They are a complete and total fraud.
[00:08:35.098 --> 00:08:39.420]  And again, in closing, to all of my enemies that are going to be so gleeful and, oh great,
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.242]  Let's get Alex Jones!
[00:08:41.302 --> 00:08:42.144]  Let's put him in jail!
[00:08:42.164 --> 00:08:42.925]  Let's put him in prison!
[00:08:43.486 --> 00:08:44.948]  You fools all know!
[00:08:46.015 --> 00:08:50.878]  That you guys even bragged in Time Magazine how you helped stage the Capitol and how you set us up.
[00:08:50.938 --> 00:08:57.342]  And we know anti-folk dressed up in Trump gear and helped trick some of the more foolish Trump supporters into joining you.
[00:08:57.823 --> 00:09:06.788]  And you know that this really hurt America and hurt Trump trying to expose election fraud and is the last thing I would do or the last thing President Trump would do.
[00:09:07.429 --> 00:09:08.810]  We did not like what happened.
[00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:09.870]  I hate what happened.
[00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:10.911]  I decry what happened.
[00:09:12.492 --> 00:09:16.039]  I decry it when you go out and shoot up police stations and burn down buildings.
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:21.510]  But when you do that, Cuomo on CNN says, whoever said demonstrations...
[00:09:22.717 --> 00:09:23.518]  Have to be peaceful.
[00:09:23.878 --> 00:09:25.800]  Well, I say they do have to be peaceful.
[00:09:26.521 --> 00:09:33.868]  And I say that again, this is political aggression against the American people in an attempt to stifle and intimidate the press.
[00:09:34.469 --> 00:09:36.751]  You know, there was a National Geographic camera crew in there.
[00:09:36.771 --> 00:09:37.752]  There was a CNN crew.
[00:09:38.333 --> 00:09:39.855]  Jade Nex was funded by CNN.
[00:09:40.235 --> 00:09:45.540]  There was all this other media and what Nancy Pelosi's nephew was in there as a journalist, but that's all okay.
[00:09:46.201 --> 00:09:56.825]  But because Sam is a Trump supporter and because Sam works at InfoWars, he's the bad guy and now he needs to go to jail and they're hoping to prove some type of conspiracy that does not exist.
[00:09:57.165 --> 00:09:58.726]  The conspiracy is the globalist.
[00:09:58.946 --> 00:10:03.627]  The conspiracy is Bill Gates and the J&J vaccine getting pulled like I told you it needed to be.
[00:10:04.007 --> 00:10:11.730]  The conspiracy is the new world order and InfoWars thanks to our listeners and their prayers and support is still on the air.
[00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:13.471]  So again, I want to thank all the
[00:10:13.831 --> 00:10:14.091]  Thank you.
[00:10:32.062 --> 00:10:34.763]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021.
[00:10:34.903 --> 00:10:37.323]  And I just want to say something.
[00:10:37.343 --> 00:10:43.564]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over the years and is truly an answer to prayer.
[00:10:43.604 --> 00:10:47.105]  And I am so blessed and thankful for all of you, the listeners of this show.
[00:10:47.145 --> 00:10:49.606]  I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you.
[00:10:50.026 --> 00:10:53.366]  Whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter.
[00:10:53.406 --> 00:10:54.146]  You got red blood.
[00:10:54.587 --> 00:11:00.548]  And if you love freedom and justice, and if you love our innocent children, we are brothers and sisters together.
[00:11:00.568 --> 00:11:01.508]  And it has just been
[00:11:02.128 --> 00:11:04.390]  An incredible experience to work with you over the years.
[00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:08.012]  And as crazy as things are, I want to keep working into the future.
[00:11:08.913 --> 00:11:11.215]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[00:11:11.815 --> 00:11:16.658]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[00:11:16.678 --> 00:11:19.280]  Again, that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:23.223]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've done.
[00:11:23.743 --> 00:11:27.366]  And just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you.
[00:11:27.846 --> 00:11:30.588]  And hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support him for worse.
