[00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:01.949]  Well, this just got brought to my attention.
[00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:04.350]  I went and checked it on the University of Texas website.
[00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.672]  This is the University of Texas Biological Research Center, Level 4, one of the most prestigious in the world.
[00:00:12.892 --> 00:00:19.694]  Immunization with SARS coronavirus vaccines leads to pulmonary autoimmune response.
[00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:22.314]  Immunopathology is what that means.
[00:00:22.654 --> 00:00:25.455]  And it says this autoimmune response is in the mice.
[00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:29.040]  We test on mice that are very similar to us with the way they react.
[00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.121]  And then they have to show the photos and all of it.
[00:00:31.561 --> 00:00:34.022]  And they have the control group, the non-control group, the control group.
[00:00:34.702 --> 00:00:38.804]  You know, those that were challenged got really sick.
[00:00:39.284 --> 00:00:40.745]  Those that weren't given it didn't get sick.
[00:00:41.565 --> 00:00:47.568]  They did a bunch of studies, and it's got all the photos of the holes eaten in their lungs, their brains, and their hearts.
[00:00:48.308 --> 00:00:50.369]  And they say you should not try these vaccines.
[00:00:50.669 --> 00:00:52.750]  They did three different vaccines, three different types.
[00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:54.587]  And they all fail.
[00:00:54.667 --> 00:00:55.708]  They all kill the animals.
[00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:11.003]  So, that's the University of Texas, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, the University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, United States of America, Center for Biodefense, what's a weapons lab?
[00:01:12.103 --> 00:01:15.026]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:42.594 --> 00:01:48.555]  We have made the deliberate decision to temporarily enhance police officers authority for the duration
[00:01:50.953 --> 00:02:03.244]  Moving forward, police will have the authority to require any individual who is not in a place of residence to first provide their purpose for not being at home and provide their home address.
[00:02:04.145 --> 00:02:11.291]  Police will also have the authority to stop a vehicle to inquire about an individual's reason for leaving their residence.
[00:02:11.531 --> 00:02:15.655]  Stay home, keep your distance, or now pay the price.
[00:02:17.042 --> 00:02:24.747]  Police with axes and assault rifles raided this venue in Sao Paulo and found about 600 party goers, most without masks.
[00:02:25.007 --> 00:02:28.990]  It was a case of asking people to go home, and if they didn't, arresting them.
[00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:37.135]  Nine police checkpoints have now been set up around the perimeter of Auckland as its 1.6 million residents return to Level 3 lockdown.
[00:02:37.335 --> 00:02:42.696]  This is the video that raised questions about how New York City is enforcing social distancing.
[00:02:42.936 --> 00:02:46.017]  A man was handcuffed in the stands for not wearing a mask.
[00:02:46.317 --> 00:02:52.078]  Disturbing video showing a violent clash between apparent social distancing violators and police in Brooklyn.
[00:02:53.098 --> 00:03:00.020]  And this cell phone video capturing the moment an officer waves a taser and repeatedly strikes a bystander during a social distancing bust.
[00:03:02.043 --> 00:03:03.505]  Get your hands off of me!
[00:03:03.966 --> 00:03:05.168]  You are kidnapping me!
[00:03:05.188 --> 00:03:06.691]  I have done nothing illegal!
[00:03:12.594 --> 00:03:18.816]  Canadians are being hit with penalties now as governments move to reinforce the shutdowns right across the country.
[00:03:18.896 --> 00:03:21.737]  And the city is also taking their mask mandate seriously.
[00:03:21.777 --> 00:03:28.159]  A fire rescue commissioner from the Tampa area was arrested on Duval Street Wednesday night when he and others were spotted without masks.
[00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:36.241]  It's more than just a suggestion, it is a CDC recommendation that it's all become sort of like lock law that you can't really trifle with.
[00:03:36.361 --> 00:03:40.403]  Ladies and gentlemen, this gathering is unfortunately unlawful.
[00:03:42.063 --> 00:03:44.610]  Under the coronavirus regulations we have currently.
[00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.316]  The officer explains that she's being arrested.
[00:03:47.557 --> 00:03:50.685]  When she continues to resist, he uses his taser.
[00:03:53.306 --> 00:03:56.068]  Put your hands right here.
[00:03:56.128 --> 00:03:57.789]  Yes, you are.
[00:03:58.149 --> 00:03:59.410]  I will tase you right now.
[00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:00.611]  What disturbance did I cause?
[00:04:00.651 --> 00:04:02.912]  What date?
[00:04:03.092 --> 00:04:04.433]  March 12th at Longo's.
[00:04:04.613 --> 00:04:05.714]  How did I cause a disturbance?
[00:04:05.774 --> 00:04:09.276]  I claimed a mask exemption and I did my shopping and I left.
[00:04:09.456 --> 00:04:10.417]  So you cannot arrest me.
[00:04:10.437 --> 00:04:11.517]  I'm not getting out of the car.
[00:04:11.557 --> 00:04:15.820]  They've blocked off the entire street with cop cars.
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:19.342]  SUVs, cop cars, blocked streets, both ends.
[00:04:35.087 --> 00:04:46.410]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.651]  Infowars has been banned.
[00:04:52.731 --> 00:04:53.631]  Arrested.
[00:04:56.632 --> 00:04:58.192]  Attacked and threatened.
[00:04:59.407 --> 00:05:01.069]  Because we are effective.
[00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:04.212]  The Great Awakening is here.
[00:05:04.532 --> 00:05:06.194]  Go to band.video.
[00:05:06.894 --> 00:05:09.036]  Download the videos and share.
[00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:15.262]  Support the Information War at infowarestore.com.
[00:05:18.305 --> 00:05:20.006]  And never give up the fight.
[00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:33.941]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:05:33.961 --> 00:05:47.525]  We've just kicked off another live transmission and the information I got before the broadcast started dovetailed with all the major research, scores of top scientists and other major studies.
[00:05:48.705 --> 00:05:59.028]  But when I read the study from an extremely prestigious viral research institute at the University of Texas Galveston where they do level 4 bioweapons research,
[00:06:01.013 --> 00:06:02.254]  I was completely blown away.
[00:06:03.554 --> 00:06:07.636]  And quite frankly, had trouble even being on air at this point.
[00:06:08.697 --> 00:06:13.599]  This audience is millions of people, you're incredible, you're amazing, but I've learned how the paradox works.
[00:06:14.619 --> 00:06:28.806]  If I said I have total proof that they knew that the COVID-19 vaccines, both mRNA and virus vector delivery systems, so both the Moderna, the Pfizer mRNA, and then the AstraZeneca,
[00:06:30.356 --> 00:06:48.846]  J&J shots, the two different classes, in the main literature warns that it causes massive autoimmune response in the brain, the heart, and in the cardiovascular system, and that they recommend it not be done because it caused massive death in the lab animals.
[00:06:50.227 --> 00:06:55.630]  If I had that info, which I do, and I cover it here on air, it just gets lost in the background noise.
[00:06:56.974 --> 00:07:09.565]  But if I built it up and said, oh, this Saturday I'm gonna do a special show for three hours, commercial free, everybody tune in, we would have millions and millions of people that tuned in specifically for that information.
[00:07:10.926 --> 00:07:20.475]  They would take it very seriously, like they were at a restaurant waiting for a big, nice plate of food to come out, and then they would devour it and then share it with others, mentally.
[00:07:22.557 --> 00:07:23.718]  And that's basically where we are.
[00:07:23.918 --> 00:07:26.320]  Also, this audience is incredibly influential.
[00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:44.773]  A lot of important people listen, but this is, at this point, I should probably just go off air and, or have Owen Schroeder come in and do a great job hosting, and just go show this document, blow up all the different clips in it, show you all the different reports it mentions and that it links to,
[00:07:47.145 --> 00:07:48.526]  And then put out a special report.
[00:07:49.026 --> 00:07:54.608]  And then I should call up the national talk show host I know, and the international talk show host I know, and get it to them.
[00:07:54.748 --> 00:08:02.391]  Guys, can I please have the Wolfgang Wodarg, Dr. Yadon Klipp from December 1st, 2020, please?
[00:08:02.751 --> 00:08:03.511]  Can I have that report?
[00:08:04.252 --> 00:08:05.272]  It's in two of the stacks in there.
[00:08:05.432 --> 00:08:05.932]  I really need that.
[00:08:05.952 --> 00:08:06.232]  Thank you.
[00:08:08.233 --> 00:08:09.894]  And that's not the report I'm getting at.
[00:08:10.574 --> 00:08:15.116]  It's just interesting to note that they listed this study that actually clicked on
[00:08:16.755 --> 00:08:26.662]  Back in December of last year, when I did a report on this, and that just now, scientists and doctors are looking at the study.
[00:08:31.985 --> 00:08:34.567]  So, I mean, I know if I just talk about this, nobody cares.
[00:08:35.948 --> 00:08:38.810]  But if I build it up, then people will care and we'll be able to stop it.
[00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:42.212]  It's a very weird paradox, how that works.
[00:08:42.292 --> 00:08:45.895]  I mean, this could save hundreds of millions, if not billions of people.
[00:08:52.449 --> 00:08:57.952]  So, I'm unable to continue the broadcast at this point.
[00:08:57.972 --> 00:08:58.793]  This is not a drama.
[00:08:59.573 --> 00:09:00.274]  I just can't do it.
[00:09:00.294 --> 00:09:11.521]  I was already doing too much this morning on other big subjects, and then I got blindsided by this, and I'm in a controlled rage right now, and I've got to take some time off.
[00:09:11.581 --> 00:09:13.042]  So, that's just the way it is.
[00:09:13.882 --> 00:09:15.523]  I don't even know if I'm coming back anymore.
[00:09:16.504 --> 00:09:19.105]  Maybe they need to kill everybody because the public doesn't care.
[00:09:19.145 --> 00:09:20.206]  Maybe you deserve to die.
[00:09:21.423 --> 00:09:35.969]  I mean, seriously, when I look at Trevor Noah and John Oliver and Stephen Colbert going along with this and attacking us and making fun of us, and when I see the talk show host doing it on CNN, Brian Stelter, they're jokes!
[00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:39.570]  I don't even wish them bad.
[00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:43.852]  They're destroying their own futures too, but they're mercenary followers.
[00:09:46.394 --> 00:09:54.857]  And then I see the doctors and the scientists, the majority of them, are going public saying this is horrible, and they're being censored by the hundreds of thousands.
[00:09:55.838 --> 00:10:01.080]  Every doctor I run into has been censored on Facebook or Twitter for pointing out these studies.
[00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:05.141]  Everybody I talk to goes and sees their doctor.
[00:10:05.161 --> 00:10:06.482]  I was talking to Shane Steiner the other day.
[00:10:07.335 --> 00:10:08.596]  He took his daughter into the doctor's.
[00:10:08.616 --> 00:10:09.316]  She had a sore throat.
[00:10:09.336 --> 00:10:11.318]  They were out of town in Florida.
[00:10:12.139 --> 00:10:17.122]  And he goes in and the doctor starts telling him about how COVID's overblown.
[00:10:17.162 --> 00:10:17.983]  It's a power grab.
[00:10:18.023 --> 00:10:20.705]  And he goes, oh yeah, you ought to listen to my friend Alex Jones.
[00:10:20.725 --> 00:10:21.585]  He goes, Alex Jones?
[00:10:22.066 --> 00:10:26.049]  I was just watching him 10 minutes ago with Aaron Russo predict all this in 2010.
[00:10:26.249 --> 00:10:31.332]  He actually died in 2000.
[00:10:34.076 --> 00:10:36.517]  2007, but the guy saw it in 2010.
[00:10:36.617 --> 00:10:39.838]  I guess that was the time stamp on it.
[00:10:41.059 --> 00:10:47.721]  And so, there's a lot of good things happening, but there's no doubt about this is a mass kill operation.
[00:10:48.851 --> 00:10:54.816]  Maybe we should all go protest at Dell Children's Hospital, or maybe go protest at the FBI in North Austin.
[00:10:54.836 --> 00:10:58.418]  I mean, I don't know what you do to draw attention in Bullhorn.
[00:10:58.679 --> 00:11:14.191]  Here is the University of Texas prestigious bioweapons research lab saying any vaccines for the coronavirus family cause massive autoimmune responses, strokes, and heart attacks, and blood clots.
[00:11:18.544 --> 00:11:19.124]  Look at this.
[00:11:19.865 --> 00:11:24.649]  They studied it on a whole bunch of animals, and it killed mass numbers of them.
[00:11:24.669 --> 00:11:30.493]  And we've already known this, but this is the University of Texas official laboratory.
[00:11:31.514 --> 00:11:32.635]  UT did this in 2012.
[00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:41.762]  You know, John Oliver goes, you know, they sped this up at warp speed because they really have been studying it for 20 years and knew how safe it was.
[00:11:42.102 --> 00:11:43.002]  No dumbass.
[00:11:43.442 --> 00:11:45.783]  Every study said it's super deadly.
[00:11:46.303 --> 00:11:50.764]  And they went and picked the most super deadly thing they could to inject this with.
[00:11:51.004 --> 00:11:57.045]  Not the virus itself that it's a supposed cure for, but the cure is the disease, is the attack.
[00:11:57.505 --> 00:11:59.646]  Massive cardiovascular problems.
[00:11:59.906 --> 00:12:06.848]  That's why they got five-year-olds having heart attacks and dying, 15-year-olds having heart attacks and dying, 20-year-olds having strokes and dying.
[00:12:07.288 --> 00:12:08.828]  Holy mackerel!
[00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:15.890]  You know what?
[00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:17.330]  I'm not gonna go off air.
[00:12:18.791 --> 00:12:21.051]  I'm just gonna read the whole damn study on air.
[00:12:21.091 --> 00:12:21.691]  How's that sound?
[00:12:23.532 --> 00:12:23.932]  And again,
[00:12:27.228 --> 00:12:32.772]  Usually these studies mince words and this spells it right out in the summary on the front page.
[00:12:33.192 --> 00:12:34.173]  University of Texas.
[00:12:35.054 --> 00:12:38.456]  Level 4 bioweapons lab in Galveston, Texas.
[00:12:39.396 --> 00:12:40.397]  One of the biggest in the world.
[00:12:41.618 --> 00:12:42.899]  Right down the road from where I'm at.
[00:12:43.819 --> 00:12:45.861]  I could be there in three and a half hours, driving in a car.
[00:12:49.543 --> 00:12:56.048]  And they say, we say you shouldn't use these vaccines and that if you do, you proceed with extreme caution.
[00:12:57.503 --> 00:13:00.925]  They didn't do the animal studies, they had already done them before, and they didn't do the human studies.
[00:13:01.165 --> 00:13:12.790]  They went directly to open air, where you can't ever track or tell what happened on purpose, and if it hits your cardiovascular... Some of the rats died in a day, some died in six weeks, but they died.
[00:13:14.511 --> 00:13:15.792]  And they bled out, folks.
[00:13:17.671 --> 00:13:19.252]  Where their brain meets the sinus.
[00:13:19.852 --> 00:13:20.993]  They bled out in their lungs.
[00:13:21.033 --> 00:13:22.014]  They bled out in their hearts.
[00:13:22.054 --> 00:13:23.235]  They bled out in their thighs.
[00:13:23.515 --> 00:13:24.635]  They bled out in their stomachs.
[00:13:24.996 --> 00:13:25.816]  They bled out.
[00:13:26.196 --> 00:13:27.077]  They bled out.
[00:13:27.437 --> 00:13:28.298]  They bled out.
[00:13:28.638 --> 00:13:29.479]  They bled out.
[00:13:29.759 --> 00:13:30.639]  They bled out.
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:34.282]  Just like you shoot somebody with a 12-gauge shotgun with double-aught buck.
[00:13:34.542 --> 00:13:35.623]  They bleed out in about a minute.
[00:13:36.843 --> 00:13:38.805]  This way you bleed out over the next few years.
[00:13:39.045 --> 00:13:40.246]  My God.
[00:13:40.726 --> 00:13:41.887]  And you know why you bleed out?
[00:13:43.788 --> 00:13:46.610]  Because your body eats a hole in your brain or your heart.
[00:13:49.735 --> 00:13:50.855]  You ever seen white blood cells?
[00:13:50.875 --> 00:13:51.775]  That's why you get pus.
[00:13:52.035 --> 00:13:55.916]  You get a cut, all of a sudden it kind of swells up, gets some pus when it starts healing.
[00:13:56.196 --> 00:13:57.897]  That's white blood cells eating everything.
[00:13:58.657 --> 00:14:01.517]  Eating the dead flesh, eating the bacteria, eating the viruses.
[00:14:02.118 --> 00:14:10.379]  How do you think it feels when they start eating on your brain, eating on your liver, eating on your heart, eating on your lungs, eating on your arteries?
[00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:12.800]  Think that feels real good?
[00:14:14.062 --> 00:14:17.864]  That's a piece of garbage Bill Gates burned in hell, you bastard!
[00:14:18.565 --> 00:14:20.406]  My God, they really did it!
[00:14:20.726 --> 00:14:22.587]  They really fricking launched it!
[00:14:22.808 --> 00:14:24.429]  And they knew it when they did it!
[00:14:24.449 --> 00:14:29.292]  Because the head of the biology department back in 2012 was Dr. Pianka!
[00:14:29.652 --> 00:14:33.194]  It's called for global extermination of all humans on Earth!
[00:14:33.514 --> 00:14:37.877]  And now they've launched the first salvo of total death!
[00:14:38.578 --> 00:14:39.318]  Hank Aaron.
[00:14:40.859 --> 00:14:42.100]  Marvelous Marvin Hagler.
[00:14:43.612 --> 00:14:46.293]  Ben Stein, all these people got violently ill.
[00:14:47.533 --> 00:14:57.115]  Some died after they took the frankenshot, the genetically engineered experimental injections.
[00:14:58.336 --> 00:15:02.517]  Thank you so much for joining us on this May 6, Thursday, live transmission.
[00:15:03.577 --> 00:15:05.877]  And I've got a lot of the original reports.
[00:15:05.978 --> 00:15:11.699]  I've got a lot of the original governmental documentation here, but I
[00:15:14.019 --> 00:15:19.181]  I had seen a link to this study, but I had not read it.
[00:15:19.221 --> 00:15:26.123]  I'd seen some of the other studies linking mRNA-style vaccines, period, to cardiovascular issues.
[00:15:26.143 --> 00:15:31.485]  And we've had medical doctors on, and virologists, and scientists, and we've talked about it.
[00:15:33.326 --> 00:15:42.669]  But imagine a 2012, highly respected, peer-reviewed, University of Texas long-term study on all sorts of different animals.
[00:15:44.577 --> 00:15:56.283]  Finding massive blood clots, brain damage, heart attacks, organ failure, you name it, and cautioning against vaccines for the coronavirus family.
[00:15:59.604 --> 00:16:11.870]  And then a coronavirus gets out of a bioweapons lab, obviously released, look at the timing, they blame it on America, it's used to lock us down, it's used to starve the third world, record low birth numbers because people aren't
[00:16:13.991 --> 00:16:14.551]  Getting together.
[00:16:16.172 --> 00:16:17.553]  Depopulation explosion.
[00:16:19.273 --> 00:16:24.896]  And it's run by the guy that says he wants to depopulate us, who with his dad ran a global depopulation group.
[00:16:26.556 --> 00:16:30.678]  And his real name of his foundation is the Global Depopulation Fund.
[00:16:37.101 --> 00:16:37.621]  Look at
[00:16:39.022 --> 00:16:39.703]  These headlines.
[00:16:39.783 --> 00:16:47.090]  Don't vaccinate the young and healthy Swedish doctor's pen open letter against mass jabs.
[00:16:50.533 --> 00:16:51.834]  Over 28 medical experts.
[00:16:52.315 --> 00:16:52.755]  Look at this.
[00:16:56.579 --> 00:17:00.203]  Woman dies after getting J&J vaccine reported to CDC.
[00:17:00.543 --> 00:17:04.387]  Family says she died a few days after getting it from, you guessed it, blood clots.
[00:17:07.861 --> 00:17:18.583]  COVID-19 vaccines designed to elicit neutralizing antibodies may sensitize vaccine recipients to more severe diseases than if they were not vaccinated.
[00:17:18.843 --> 00:17:22.744]  It's not just an autoimmune response where you attack yourself.
[00:17:22.804 --> 00:17:23.884]  It's a bunch of other stuff.
[00:17:23.944 --> 00:17:32.806]  I mean, this is, folks, the vaccine creates an autoimmune response to what is already all over your body, a very common protein.
[00:17:35.727 --> 00:17:36.287]  And they knew it.
[00:17:36.327 --> 00:17:37.187]  That's why they chose this.
[00:17:37.207 --> 00:17:37.487]  But see,
[00:17:38.871 --> 00:17:44.634]  If they give you a polio vaccine that has live polio, and you get polio, Gates got caught many times and kicked out of a bunch of countries.
[00:17:44.854 --> 00:17:45.555]  That's too obvious.
[00:17:45.915 --> 00:17:56.821]  You put a female hormone in a tetanus shot, so the body has an autoimmune response to that female hormone that kicks in during second trimester, well now the body has an autoimmune response against the baby every time, and you have a violent miscarriage.
[00:17:57.301 --> 00:17:58.722]  Ends up killing the woman a lot of times, too.
[00:17:59.763 --> 00:18:00.563]  Eats their uterus.
[00:18:01.424 --> 00:18:04.565]  That's a little obvious they got caught doing that, the UN did, on record, in the 90s.
[00:18:05.836 --> 00:18:27.174]  But if you give somebody something that just keeps replicating in the body and takes over the mitochondria and has your body recognize this protein is outside and it's not good because they put this lipid of antifreeze around it, they put antifreeze around it, quote, to get it into the cell, but that's not really what's happening.
[00:18:27.654 --> 00:18:34.760]  So the body sees that from an outside force with a normal protein and now has an autoimmune response to the protein.
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:43.142]  The evil of this is just staggering and here's the University of Texas study.
[00:18:44.043 --> 00:18:58.568]  Immunization with SARS coronavirus vaccines leads to pulmonary immunopathology on challenge with the SARS virus.
[00:19:04.238 --> 00:19:05.358]  Such an incredible report.
[00:19:05.978 --> 00:19:14.801]  The conclusion, the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine all include antibody and protection against infection with SARS-CoV-2.
[00:19:15.121 --> 00:19:25.504]  However, challenge of mice given any of the vaccines led to occurrence of Th2-type immunopathology.
[00:19:26.524 --> 00:19:26.984]  Did you hear that?
[00:19:27.004 --> 00:19:29.585]  Let me read that again.
[00:19:31.085 --> 00:19:32.846]  The SARS-CoV-2 vaccines all
[00:19:34.005 --> 00:19:38.626]  Induced antibody and protection against infection from SARS-CoV-2.
[00:19:39.186 --> 00:19:56.330]  However, challenge of mice, given any of the vaccines, led to occurrence of the Th2 type immunopathology suggesting hypersensitivity to SARS-CoV-2 components was induced.
[00:19:58.683 --> 00:20:05.046]  Caution in proceeding to application of SARS COVID vaccine in humans is indicated.
[00:20:08.688 --> 00:20:12.450]  Now when you actually read the report, holy mackerel!
[00:20:15.932 --> 00:20:19.974]  You ought to read here, overhead shot please, what happened to the mice.
[00:20:20.874 --> 00:20:28.278]  Bleeding out their sinus, bleeding out their brains, bleeding out their hearts, young mice, middle-aged mice, old mice, all the mice.
[00:20:32.403 --> 00:20:35.666]  The lungs being eaten.
[00:20:39.689 --> 00:20:41.711]  Neutralizing antibody assays.
[00:20:43.592 --> 00:20:44.993]  What happened to the animals?
[00:20:46.715 --> 00:20:47.055]  Death.
[00:20:49.657 --> 00:20:52.399]  University of Texas, this is prestigious.
[00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:59.085]  This is the university that did a long-term study on a bunch of vaccines they already had on the shelf.
[00:21:00.595 --> 00:21:02.817]  And they all do the same thing.
[00:21:02.997 --> 00:21:05.419]  mRNA or virus vector.
[00:21:08.621 --> 00:21:13.384]  They've even got cross-sections of the tissue of the poor little mice and how they got eaten up.
[00:21:14.605 --> 00:21:15.886]  And the holes that got eaten in them.
[00:21:20.129 --> 00:21:22.451]  Your body killing you.
[00:21:25.013 --> 00:21:26.714]  And they think the public's so stupid
[00:21:28.575 --> 00:21:30.196]  They're going to be able to cover all this up.
[00:21:30.996 --> 00:21:32.897]  Definition of Immopathology.
[00:21:33.297 --> 00:21:34.178]  Immunopathology.
[00:21:34.758 --> 00:21:38.680]  A branch of medicine that deals with immune response association with disease.
[00:21:40.541 --> 00:21:41.081]  And you heard them.
[00:21:41.302 --> 00:21:45.864]  With all the vaccines they tested, it fried the mice.
[00:21:50.386 --> 00:21:57.390]  Informed consent disclosure to vaccine trial subjects of risk of COVID-19 vaccines worsening clinical diseases.
[00:21:58.404 --> 00:22:02.146]  I got a whole other big study here that we'll be getting to.
[00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:09.671]  Isn't that just incredible?
[00:22:10.732 --> 00:22:12.353]  I am poleaxed at this point.
[00:22:12.393 --> 00:22:19.258]  I am like been hit in the head because I already spent three days at a time I didn't have back in December
[00:22:20.219 --> 00:22:32.772]  Reading this whole thick report by Wolfgang Wudarg and Dr. Yidan, both at the highest prestigious level there is, saying this will cause autoimmune diseases, strokes, heart attacks.
[00:22:33.072 --> 00:22:33.693]  Please don't do it.
[00:22:33.733 --> 00:22:34.794]  Of course, everything they said happened.
[00:22:36.192 --> 00:22:38.394]  But they linked to this study actually in here.
[00:22:38.414 --> 00:22:42.176]  I remember looking at it and just reading so much, I just glazed over it.
[00:22:42.396 --> 00:22:46.759]  And they got a bunch of other studies showing that they already tried to get these things approved before.
[00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:50.822]  Why'd they never have a vaccine for the Corona family?
[00:22:51.043 --> 00:22:52.744]  That's the most common, one of the most common families.
[00:22:53.104 --> 00:22:56.346]  Because it's a frickin' protein that your body's made up out of.
[00:23:00.669 --> 00:23:01.190]  It's incredible.
[00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:04.891]  And I've got some, I was so ready to cover all this other news.
[00:23:05.351 --> 00:23:06.151]  Oh my gosh.
[00:23:06.751 --> 00:23:13.373]  I just spent last night and this morning reading 50-something pages of a Pentagon DARPA document that just, I mean.
[00:23:16.594 --> 00:23:21.455]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this live Thursday transmission.
[00:23:23.076 --> 00:23:23.896]  Here's what I'm going to do.
[00:23:24.116 --> 00:23:26.497]  I'm going to settle down.
[00:23:28.157 --> 00:23:55.764]  And I'm gonna take all of this vaccine tyranny, global government, forced inoculation, forced quarantine, forced segregation of the population news, CNN saying bully your neighbors and family into taking the vaccine, total intimidation, total evil, University of Texas, scientific reports saying they tested three different coronavirus COVID vaccines,
[00:23:57.895 --> 00:24:06.923]  Nine years ago, and that they caused autoimmune responses of the lungs and heart and brain being eaten by the body.
[00:24:10.606 --> 00:24:18.853]  I'm going to take this stack, and I'm going to put it up until next hour.
[00:24:28.905 --> 00:24:30.386]  I'm like a deer in the headlights here.
[00:24:31.947 --> 00:24:33.389]  I mean, I know you are as well.
[00:24:34.409 --> 00:24:38.032]  And they think that we're all just going to put up with this.
[00:24:38.052 --> 00:24:42.235]  You know, if a robber comes to your house and breaks into your back door, you know what to do.
[00:24:42.916 --> 00:24:46.138]  Or if you're in a parking lot and somebody tries to mug you, you either fight back or you submit.
[00:24:46.639 --> 00:24:48.540]  But what do you do when it's the medical system?
[00:24:50.061 --> 00:24:54.065]  And you get their own documents and they admit this is deadly, this is wrong, it doesn't protect you.
[00:24:54.285 --> 00:24:56.286]  They lie about everything they've done with SARS.
[00:24:58.254 --> 00:24:59.074]  And COVID-19?
[00:25:03.597 --> 00:25:22.208]  They war-gamed it all out, and they're taking over, and putting us under martial law, and bankrupting small businesses and farms, and admitting it's a takeover plan, and they've got all these people who are learned helplessness Stockholm Syndrome victims serving their oppressors, and they're telling those zombies to come get in our faces because we're not drinking the Kool-Aid.
[00:25:23.953 --> 00:25:27.355]  But if you look at history, there's always groups that make big authoritarian moves.
[00:25:27.755 --> 00:25:34.959]  And each time, evil has a new science, a new technology, the Blitzkrieg, whatever they want to call it, that they're going to use to win.
[00:25:36.079 --> 00:25:40.521]  And good always gets caught with its pants down, but in the end, wins.
[00:25:41.562 --> 00:25:45.004]  The question is, how many billions of people are going to die this time?
[00:25:45.284 --> 00:25:46.784]  They're making a run at us.
[00:25:47.325 --> 00:25:49.486]  They're going for the full depopulation now.
[00:25:51.513 --> 00:26:04.681]  And I told you the rat studies, the mice studies, the ferret studies with regular mRNA or regular virus vector, regular attenuated virus, whole virus vaccines, what they call it.
[00:26:06.963 --> 00:26:10.885]  I mean, we're talking 100% death rates in many of the studies.
[00:26:10.925 --> 00:26:13.547]  In the other studies, it's all more than 50% die an early death.
[00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:18.690]  Wow!
[00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:20.051]  I mean, just wow!
[00:26:20.971 --> 00:26:23.711]  I feel like I should just go get on my knees at a church.
[00:26:24.172 --> 00:26:28.913]  But those churches are full of little World Council of Churches, Rockefeller-approved non-preachers.
[00:26:28.933 --> 00:26:29.893]  They've taken everything over.
[00:26:31.653 --> 00:26:34.514]  I mean, this is end-of-the-world stuff, folks.
[00:26:38.715 --> 00:26:42.436]  It's absolute confirmation that these people are psychotic murderers.
[00:26:43.236 --> 00:26:46.157]  And then, if we don't do something about it, we're aiding and abetting them.
[00:26:51.417 --> 00:27:00.645]  And then it makes me want to just get back to my family and run to the hills.
[00:27:00.945 --> 00:27:11.134]  I mean, not even out of fear, it's just at a cellular level, it feels like it's wrong to not run to the most remote area possible and just get away from this.
[00:27:11.815 --> 00:27:12.976]  That's a normal response.
[00:27:15.061 --> 00:27:20.424]  The Pilgrims let the tyranny of England try to have freedom and of course set up one of their own.
[00:27:20.464 --> 00:27:23.066]  That's the way the world works, but it's the idea that counts.
[00:27:24.647 --> 00:27:25.827]  And so I'm not choking.
[00:27:26.087 --> 00:27:27.508]  I never choke in front of a big crowd.
[00:27:27.568 --> 00:27:28.489]  I never choke on air.
[00:27:28.509 --> 00:27:32.731]  I don't get butterflies being on air, but I am nearing the headlights at this point.
[00:27:33.992 --> 00:27:36.933]  I probably should just open the phones up and ask listeners, what do we do?
[00:27:37.353 --> 00:27:38.754]  How do we respond to this?
[00:27:39.575 --> 00:27:40.735]  How do you respond to this?
[00:27:41.075 --> 00:27:41.776]  Let me do this then.
[00:27:45.199 --> 00:27:59.991]  I'm going to open the phones up, so let's get the great John Harmon in here, my producer of 18 years, who's a great call screener, and by that we don't screen for your content, we screen for quality phone line, and that you're able to talk, which is all I rate listeners.
[00:28:00.892 --> 00:28:05.456]  But get him in there please, because I want to open the phones up.
[00:28:06.843 --> 00:28:07.684]  We're good to go.
[00:28:36.955 --> 00:28:48.002]  Or if you had a direct relation, mother, father, son, daughter, who had a wonderful effect from these Franken shots, or tell us the effect you had.
[00:28:50.572 --> 00:28:52.474]  877-789-2539, 877-789-Alex, 877-789-2539, and we will start taking your calls next hour.
[00:28:52.494 --> 00:28:55.036]  Maybe even sooner, but I want to get the phones loaded up at 877-789-2539.
[00:28:55.216 --> 00:28:57.078]  And this is what's happened, because here's the deal.
[00:28:57.118 --> 00:28:58.759]  I knew this was all coming forever.
[00:29:15.776 --> 00:29:16.557]  But it was in beta.
[00:29:17.077 --> 00:29:20.360]  But now all these different projects and globalist plans are coming together.
[00:29:20.881 --> 00:29:26.486]  And then I even read, this is a giant report that's excellent.
[00:29:29.408 --> 00:29:30.990]  That is 42 pages long.
[00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:34.873]  30 plus pages of it is DARPA reports.
[00:29:35.814 --> 00:29:38.376]  That's the group, the scientific dictatorship that runs it all.
[00:29:40.458 --> 00:29:42.160]  That's the eugenicists, that's the death cult.
[00:29:43.516 --> 00:29:46.558]  That created the CIA, just the NSA, all of it.
[00:29:47.439 --> 00:29:54.244]  And they actually say their number one enemy is the American people and that they're going to take over and that white people are bad.
[00:29:54.845 --> 00:30:00.029]  I mean, of course this didn't come out of black people's brains or white people's brains down the street.
[00:30:00.389 --> 00:30:02.170]  It came out of the big scientific system.
[00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:08.375]  It's the mainstream media, it's the corporations, it's the universities, it's the establishment wants to divide and conquer.
[00:30:08.395 --> 00:30:10.637]  They want us divided before they slaughter all of us.
[00:30:10.997 --> 00:30:11.918]  Black, white, they don't care.
[00:30:13.942 --> 00:30:17.508]  This report is mind-blowing.
[00:30:18.269 --> 00:30:21.675]  Because we know that they're purging the military and doing litmus tests, that's admitted.
[00:30:23.218 --> 00:30:25.101]  But the guy they've got as their front guy...
[00:30:26.224 --> 00:30:27.605]  is just the front man.
[00:30:28.385 --> 00:30:39.890]  A DARPA report got leaked out, which they admit is a real DARPA report, that he's following, and it is the end of the human military, and the end of human intelligence, HUMET, and for the machine takeover.
[00:30:40.050 --> 00:30:49.334]  This is just a DARPA sabotage of human biological systems, so we're so dysfunctional that once things collapse, they'll bring in total AI that directs all human activity.
[00:30:49.595 --> 00:30:52.256]  The first thing they've got to make is dysfunctional before they bring that system in.
[00:30:53.516 --> 00:30:57.279]  And it's all right there and it's just incredible.
[00:30:57.619 --> 00:31:01.922]  So I'm going to cover that next segment and just all the other incredible stuff.
[00:31:02.703 --> 00:31:07.166]  More welfare, more farm aid, more everything for minorities instead of white people.
[00:31:07.947 --> 00:31:13.711]  I mean, total racism on its face, but getting us used to fighting over the socialist crumbs like Venezuela.
[00:31:14.411 --> 00:31:15.152]  That's coming up.
[00:31:16.707 --> 00:31:19.028]  Massive censorship news coming up.
[00:31:19.728 --> 00:31:21.048]  Huge financial news.
[00:31:21.088 --> 00:31:24.169]  There is just so much here today.
[00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:38.914]  So, medical doctors, scientists, specifically on what we just covered with this University of Texas report and all the others about the protein in coronaviruses being all over the human body.
[00:31:39.354 --> 00:31:43.636]  And this is the equivalent of creating, you know, a vaccine that makes you attack
[00:31:45.302 --> 00:31:45.642]  Water.
[00:31:46.223 --> 00:31:47.283]  And then it would attack your whole body.
[00:31:47.324 --> 00:31:50.426]  I mean, it's absolutely over the top.
[00:31:52.267 --> 00:31:53.568]  Yeah, print me that report too.
[00:31:53.868 --> 00:31:56.690]  COVID-19 and Alzheimer's.
[00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:57.230]  That's a study.
[00:31:57.631 --> 00:31:58.972]  Oh, but John Oliver said I made it up.
[00:31:59.352 --> 00:32:00.393]  He's a good man.
[00:32:00.753 --> 00:32:05.977]  I just show you, read it to you, on air, where it's from, prestigious, but it's okay.
[00:32:05.997 --> 00:32:06.837]  We got a comedian.
[00:32:07.117 --> 00:32:07.678]  He's got a
[00:32:09.025 --> 00:32:14.247]  Cockney accent like he's, you know, unloading stolen loot at the London Wharf.
[00:32:14.887 --> 00:32:15.447]  We'll be right back.
[00:32:15.467 --> 00:32:15.907]  Stay with us.
[00:32:16.888 --> 00:32:18.348]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:32:18.368 --> 00:32:18.888]  to 3 p.m.
[00:32:18.928 --> 00:32:20.749]  Central, we are here live.
[00:32:20.809 --> 00:32:21.709]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:26.551]  So, let me just show you what's in the news stack today to give you an example of who's behind this.
[00:32:27.211 --> 00:32:28.472]  The power structure of the system.
[00:32:29.568 --> 00:32:40.898]  We have Carol Baker, CDC spokeswoman, telling a giant amphitheater full of scientists and doctors and nurses that white people are inherently bad and must be gotten rid of because they don't submit to the government.
[00:32:41.619 --> 00:32:42.840]  So that's where this is coming from.
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:50.667]  And I guess we do have kind of an Irish, Scottish, English background of a thousand years of war between those groups and kings trying to get freedom.
[00:32:51.047 --> 00:32:55.031]  And that's where the Magna Carta and then juries and basic rights come from.
[00:32:55.091 --> 00:32:55.331]  Yes.
[00:32:56.092 --> 00:33:02.516]  Yes, what white people basically invented really, really angers the other white people that want to run things.
[00:33:03.857 --> 00:33:04.577]  So let's continue.
[00:33:04.757 --> 00:33:10.821]  Report, Biden relief prioritizes funds for non-white business owners.
[00:33:11.501 --> 00:33:19.906]  Well, I mean, it's dangerous for the government to order you to shut down and then say, now I'm going to give you money, which is usually about 10% of what you actually need to be made whole.
[00:33:20.407 --> 00:33:21.727]  Plus it devalues the currency.
[00:33:21.747 --> 00:33:22.348]  Nothing's for free.
[00:33:23.732 --> 00:33:24.453]  Which is already happening.
[00:33:24.473 --> 00:33:28.076]  You see inflation really accelerating now to frightening levels.
[00:33:28.096 --> 00:33:30.878]  It's going to get really scary the next six months, but that's a side issue.
[00:33:32.579 --> 00:33:38.644]  Imagine if Martin Luther King said, and we're going to give the brown people a better shot than the white people.
[00:33:38.664 --> 00:33:42.808]  Well, you argue that's affirmative action, but then it goes to like a newborn white baby.
[00:33:43.168 --> 00:33:43.769]  What have they done?
[00:33:44.915 --> 00:33:46.977]  And I mean, blacks ran slavery too.
[00:33:46.997 --> 00:33:56.365]  So because a black person might have had a great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather that helped sell black slaves to slavers, both black slavers, Arab slavers, and white slavers, I mean, is he to blame?
[00:33:56.405 --> 00:33:56.965]  Of course not!
[00:33:58.467 --> 00:33:59.888]  But that's an authoritarian idea.
[00:34:01.509 --> 00:34:03.551]  That you're guilty for what your ancestors did.
[00:34:03.571 --> 00:34:04.532]  But it continues.
[00:34:05.493 --> 00:34:10.397]  Disabled farmers sues Biden administration for racist land reform provision.
[00:34:12.677 --> 00:34:22.823]  Saying we're going to give more money to blacks to get land than white people in loans and other different federal aid packages or laws that, you know, farmers get in aid packages.
[00:34:24.444 --> 00:34:28.826]  New Jersey police officer fired for calling BLM protesters terrorists.
[00:34:30.827 --> 00:34:33.349]  Rock climbing classes designed for students of color.
[00:34:33.749 --> 00:34:34.930]  Oh, designed for them.
[00:34:36.334 --> 00:34:40.416]  School draws racist accusations because whites aren't allowed.
[00:34:41.037 --> 00:34:41.237]  Wow!
[00:34:41.437 --> 00:34:43.138]  How is it designed for blacks?
[00:34:44.438 --> 00:34:45.639]  Oh, because blacks are different?
[00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:49.061]  Think about this, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:50.321 --> 00:34:53.283]  And this is the power structure wanting to own and control groups of people.
[00:34:53.363 --> 00:34:54.063]  It's slavery.
[00:34:56.284 --> 00:34:57.825]  Think about how serious this is.
[00:34:57.865 --> 00:35:04.649]  Meanwhile, a Nashville cop lured into ambush by an Islamist is shot in critical condition, but that's okay because he's white.
[00:35:06.994 --> 00:35:07.975]  Now enter this guy.
[00:35:08.015 --> 00:35:15.198]  I'm not going to play clips of him on MSNBC and CNN saying whites are inherently evil and America is the worst country on earth and the country doesn't need to exist.
[00:35:15.318 --> 00:35:18.840]  It's all in the report by Revolver News.
[00:35:21.101 --> 00:35:27.925]  Check out this story because it will blow you away.
[00:35:28.805 --> 00:35:30.586]  It's totally insane.
[00:35:31.407 --> 00:35:35.249]  You've seen how the whole Pentagon system is being set up.
[00:35:39.497 --> 00:35:55.144]  And for some reason this printed without the headline, and so I read the whole thing basically, but I don't have the headline, but we're going to pull it up for you so you can see it for TV viewers, and it's a huge Revolver News article about Bishop Garrison, and the headline was something like this.
[00:35:56.905 --> 00:36:01.967]  You've heard about the Pentagon's diversities are, well it's worse than you think.
[00:36:02.507 --> 00:36:02.927]  There it is.
[00:36:03.227 --> 00:36:06.449]  Meet Bishop Garrison, the Pentagon's hatchet man in charge of putting
[00:36:09.239 --> 00:36:10.000]  Third time's a charm.
[00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:10.820]  Just go ahead and try it again.
[00:36:12.481 --> 00:36:20.946]  Meet Bishop Garrison, the Pentagon's hatchet man in charge of purging Make America Great Again patriots and installing race theory in the military.
[00:36:22.847 --> 00:36:35.755]  And then when you read this thing for yourself, what's incredible is, not that he's white or inherently evil and he's a black supremacist and the equivalent of a black KKK member, but with power,
[00:36:37.748 --> 00:36:46.310]  Bishop Garrison is the advisor to the Secretary of Defense, Austin, who also is a black supremacist.
[00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:48.570]  That's why he was put there to create division.
[00:36:49.951 --> 00:36:54.092]  And they've got all the quotes from the DARPA report that's now been made public.
[00:36:56.352 --> 00:37:00.073]  And it says right here in the DARPA report,
[00:37:02.688 --> 00:37:08.773]  But the core ideology of patriot extremism, which they list as terrorism, is the ideology holds that the U.S.
[00:37:08.793 --> 00:37:13.678]  government has become corrupt, has overstepped its constitutional boundaries.
[00:37:14.198 --> 00:37:16.921]  That is a measured, common-sense statement that's true.
[00:37:18.393 --> 00:37:29.777]  And it goes on to say what you saw in that report we covered yesterday, put out by Bill and Melinda Gates, that we should use the Pentagon and CIA and Cyber Command against vaccine deniers, or COVID deniers.
[00:37:29.937 --> 00:37:36.179]  And what you saw Biden say, if you don't like me, you're a white supremacist, and that's illegal, that's terrorism, we're going to use the Pentagon on you.
[00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:40.582]  And the CIA ads they're running are all about getting the white people.
[00:37:40.762 --> 00:37:43.763]  So this is how they plan to gut this country is with race war.
[00:37:44.243 --> 00:37:46.805]  It is a foreign multinational banking cartel that's doing it.
[00:37:47.225 --> 00:37:48.486]  Communist China is doing it.
[00:37:49.706 --> 00:37:50.487]  They shut us down.
[00:37:50.547 --> 00:37:51.347]  They lock us down.
[00:37:51.387 --> 00:37:51.947]  They do this.
[00:37:51.987 --> 00:37:54.929]  They get us all dependent and they say, oh, we're not going to help the white people.
[00:37:54.969 --> 00:37:55.469]  They're bad.
[00:37:55.509 --> 00:37:56.850]  We're only going to help the brown people.
[00:37:58.254 --> 00:38:04.719]  Which makes white people become hateful of brown people, and brown people become hateful of white people, and it's the classic divide and conquer.
[00:38:04.759 --> 00:38:10.524]  This is so cynical, so evil, is the definition of not just racism, but of tribal...
[00:38:12.489 --> 00:38:16.871]  Balkanization, which is the way empires control countries they've conquered or peoples they've conquered.
[00:38:16.911 --> 00:38:17.852]  It is so cynical.
[00:38:17.912 --> 00:38:18.512]  It is so bad.
[00:38:18.572 --> 00:38:21.434]  You've got to go read this report for yourself.
[00:38:21.574 --> 00:38:25.376]  I mean, words cannot describe it.
[00:38:25.396 --> 00:38:28.618]  In fact, I'm going to have it posted to InfoWars.com.
[00:38:28.638 --> 00:38:29.858]  It's like 40-something pages long.
[00:38:29.878 --> 00:38:30.399]  We're going to post
[00:38:30.999 --> 00:38:34.121]  Half of it, I'm sure they won't mind, and put a link to them to read the whole thing.
[00:38:34.161 --> 00:38:35.562]  But this needs to be archived.
[00:38:35.962 --> 00:38:37.003]  This needs to be shared.
[00:38:37.644 --> 00:38:38.584]  This needs to be supported.
[00:38:38.604 --> 00:38:40.526]  And Revolver is doing a fabulous job.
[00:38:41.046 --> 00:38:47.430]  But anybody can go read the leaked DARPA report that, you know, good people are around that they leaked it.
[00:38:47.470 --> 00:38:48.831]  And DARPA admits it's a real report.
[00:38:49.352 --> 00:38:52.774]  You've got to see it for yourself.
[00:38:52.874 --> 00:38:55.556]  It is a blueprint and a battle plan.
[00:38:57.756 --> 00:39:02.000]  But the Pentagon opinion police have a black guy as their front.
[00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:04.522]  So they can say, oh, it's grassroots, it's a black guy.
[00:39:04.922 --> 00:39:10.346]  No, it is DARPA, the sinister, globalist organization.
[00:39:10.386 --> 00:39:11.627]  You just saw the latest stuff.
[00:39:11.808 --> 00:39:14.110]  Oh, you're a white farmer got flooded?
[00:39:14.910 --> 00:39:16.371]  Oh, you're a white farmer, crops died?
[00:39:16.492 --> 00:39:19.074]  Oh, you don't get the aid relief.
[00:39:19.114 --> 00:39:20.175]  You're white, you didn't know?
[00:39:20.515 --> 00:39:22.677]  You're an old white guy in a wheelchair that's got cancer?
[00:39:24.770 --> 00:39:32.336]  And, oh sorry, you can't apply for... I mean, can you imagine the resentment that's designed to create?
[00:39:34.878 --> 00:39:37.380]  And so, that's where all this is going, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:39:37.821 --> 00:39:39.082]  I mean, in fact, it's already here.
[00:39:40.903 --> 00:39:42.805]  And this is a Marxist-Leninist takeover.
[00:39:42.825 --> 00:39:45.727]  It has nothing to do with equity or freedom or coming together.
[00:39:46.128 --> 00:39:49.771]  It has everything to do with total and complete abject slavery.
[00:39:51.184 --> 00:39:52.545]  All right, Nick Fuentes is going to pop in.
[00:39:52.585 --> 00:39:54.226]  He's okay, folks, but still on the no-fly list.
[00:39:54.266 --> 00:39:54.926]  He's filing soon.
[00:39:54.946 --> 00:39:56.747]  He's going to pop in last segment of the next hour.
[00:39:57.067 --> 00:40:02.691]  But I'm going to go to John, Prinseca, or Franseca, my eyes are going out here.
[00:40:02.751 --> 00:40:09.975]  Cameron, Athena, James, Nicole, Brian, Beth, Natasha, and Rick as soon as we start.
[00:40:11.189 --> 00:40:11.709]  The next hour.
[00:40:11.729 --> 00:40:13.170]  I've got some good news for everybody.
[00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:14.290]  People love it.
[00:40:14.310 --> 00:40:20.693]  It's 10 hour clean energy turbo force with all these great natural ingredients that supercharge the natural energy that's in it.
[00:40:21.093 --> 00:40:23.435]  Five types of time to release energy.
[00:40:23.455 --> 00:40:26.256]  10 hours of clean energy for the average person.
[00:40:26.296 --> 00:40:27.937]  Some people more, some people less.
[00:40:28.577 --> 00:40:32.859]  I can take a quarter bag of it when I'm exhausted at 5 o'clock and got to work till midnight on the road.
[00:40:34.343 --> 00:40:37.984]  But then, come down off of it really, really smooth and good.
[00:40:38.004 --> 00:40:43.846]  When I do something like a Cobb & Schill or something after that, or take some magnesium powder, or take Rocket Rest, but it's back in stock.

[00:41:41.394 --> 00:41:42.595]  They've been suppressing this news.
[00:41:42.615 --> 00:41:43.216]  We'll be covering it.

[00:42:14.283 --> 00:42:19.006]  And ask for the Alex Jones Special.
[00:42:19.487 --> 00:42:21.228]  It is one of the best deals you're going to find out there.
[00:42:21.368 --> 00:42:24.650]  And they're a big sponsor of ours now, helping us stay on the air.
[00:42:24.910 --> 00:42:27.472]  So check them out at InfoWarsPhone.com or 941-955-1020.
[00:42:28.933 --> 00:42:31.616]  All right, we're going to go to break.
[00:42:32.196 --> 00:42:34.839]  Hour number two of the most devastating COVID news yet.
[00:42:36.501 --> 00:42:37.782]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:42:37.902 --> 00:42:40.365]  All right, I'm taking your calls for the next 45 minutes.
[00:42:44.349 --> 00:42:47.692]  And then we're going to have one of the only Nick Fuentes.
[00:42:48.851 --> 00:42:51.632]  Who's filing suit on the TSA for being on the no-fly list.
[00:42:52.192 --> 00:42:53.172]  We're all Nick Fuentes now.
[00:42:53.212 --> 00:42:54.592]  It's Nick today, us tomorrow.
[00:42:55.152 --> 00:42:55.992]  He's popping in.
[00:42:56.072 --> 00:43:00.613]  And then I've got a very important special report I shot this morning that is going to premiere here.
[00:43:01.334 --> 00:43:03.934]  Dealing with pedophile rings out in the open.
[00:43:04.474 --> 00:43:05.474]  Very important report.
[00:43:05.494 --> 00:43:06.335]  I mean, all this stuff.
[00:43:06.975 --> 00:43:07.675]  It's the quickening.
[00:43:07.715 --> 00:43:08.715]  It's all coming together.
[00:43:08.735 --> 00:43:12.036]  The mask is basically 95% off.
[00:43:13.036 --> 00:43:13.616]  It's insane.
[00:43:14.516 --> 00:43:17.417]  And then Greg Reese is going to be popping in because his
[00:43:19.312 --> 00:43:24.695]  His report on unmasking Illuminati has really caused a fracas, and that's a good thing.
[00:43:25.436 --> 00:43:28.798]  We want to get an open debate about all this stuff, and that's what we want.
[00:43:29.618 --> 00:43:35.742]  And so he's going to host a segment and air his report, and then Matt Bracken takes over in the fourth hour.
[00:43:35.762 --> 00:43:37.784]  I have been called away.
[00:43:39.181 --> 00:43:41.504]  To a little court hearing today.
[00:43:42.185 --> 00:43:43.607]  The Wonders of Family Court.
[00:43:43.647 --> 00:43:45.028]  So that's why I taped something this morning.
[00:43:45.729 --> 00:43:47.612]  Because I've got to go at 1 o'clock today.
[00:43:47.632 --> 00:43:49.234]  But I'll be back after that this afternoon.
[00:43:49.694 --> 00:43:51.757]  There is so much to cover and so much to get to.
[00:43:51.777 --> 00:43:52.918]  And we've got...
[00:43:54.249 --> 00:43:55.350]  Loaded phone lines here.
[00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:58.651]  John says daughter and friends had reactions to vaccines.
[00:43:59.212 --> 00:44:03.274]  Francesca is a nurse, works in nursing home, has comments on vaccines.
[00:44:03.734 --> 00:44:07.356]  Travis is a medical worker and grandmother had reactions.
[00:44:08.136 --> 00:44:10.998]  Athena is a mother-in-law, has heart problems after vaccine.
[00:44:11.378 --> 00:44:14.180]  James is in Iowa, pregnant sister, had baby.
[00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:15.480]  Now baby has seizures.
[00:44:16.301 --> 00:44:20.123]  Nicole, Florida husband, is a nurse, mother-in-law.
[00:44:21.428 --> 00:44:21.948]  We're good to go.
[00:44:52.634 --> 00:44:55.856]  And then I've got some good news, and let me just start getting to that now.
[00:44:56.516 --> 00:44:59.858]  Cheney's faced the boot in Washington.
[00:45:00.598 --> 00:45:04.741]  Not just Cheney, but her husband and the whole family and the wife and all of them.
[00:45:05.441 --> 00:45:08.843]  Wyoming hasn't looked much better.
[00:45:09.723 --> 00:45:15.507]  Liz Cheney fall shows that Trump is here to stay.
[00:45:16.207 --> 00:45:19.689]  So the whole family, we're told, is like God, like John McCain's family.
[00:45:21.343 --> 00:45:22.664]  The daughter, the mother, all of them.
[00:45:22.684 --> 00:45:29.507]  We had to listen to everything they say, but the fact that she has been removed from the leadership is a good thing.
[00:45:31.788 --> 00:45:41.172]  They have polls in her so-called home state, where she's a congresswoman, where 89% don't like her.
[00:45:42.973 --> 00:45:45.354]  CNN polls have them at 77% don't like her.
[00:45:45.935 --> 00:45:46.635]  She's a joke!
[00:45:46.695 --> 00:45:48.696]  We don't want neocon, warmongering,
[00:45:50.697 --> 00:45:51.358]  We're good to go.
[00:46:07.506 --> 00:46:15.992]  That is a good thing, and people are like, oh my gosh, Trump is so powerful, and everybody he endorses wins by giant margins in special elections.
[00:46:16.032 --> 00:46:30.642]  Yes, that's why we need to be supportive of Trump, to stay political, to stay engaged, to stay involved, because they're trying to indict his inner circle, to put pressure on him to pull out and let them have control of the Republican Party.
[00:46:30.942 --> 00:46:33.504]  So that's a great good thing Trump is doing, is not backing down.
[00:46:33.524 --> 00:46:34.985]  That's why they're getting ready to probably indict
[00:46:36.306 --> 00:46:37.589]  Giuliani and then Don Jr.
[00:46:38.791 --> 00:46:41.917]  So I say I have a love-disgust relationship with Trump.
[00:46:42.277 --> 00:46:42.899]  I love Trump.
[00:46:42.919 --> 00:46:43.540]  I think he's a good guy.
[00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:44.101]  He means well.
[00:46:44.161 --> 00:46:46.265]  But on the vaccines, he stepped in it.
[00:46:47.319 --> 00:46:49.281]  And on the censorship, he didn't do anything.
[00:46:49.701 --> 00:46:53.384]  He still is being nice to Rubio and other neocon Republicans.
[00:46:53.444 --> 00:47:04.752]  So we need, however we can on his new website, the president's desk, and all the rest of it, to reach out to him with feedback and say, we want you to still be hardcore.
[00:47:05.092 --> 00:47:08.614]  We want you to realize you got bamboozled by these so-called shots.
[00:47:08.634 --> 00:47:10.516]  It's really going to hurt you as the evidence comes out.
[00:47:10.996 --> 00:47:12.697]  He needs to realize he was wrong now.
[00:47:12.757 --> 00:47:16.097]  We really need you to continue the purge of the neocons.
[00:47:16.137 --> 00:47:19.478]  So, again, we need to keep Trump very close to us.
[00:47:19.538 --> 00:47:20.299]  He is our friend.
[00:47:20.319 --> 00:47:24.140]  We need to keep him very, very close, but with tough love.
[00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:24.720]  We'll be right back.
[00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:37.503]  Ladies and gentlemen, coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin, broadcasting worldwide, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:47:37.523 --> 00:47:39.004]  People ask me, why do you live?
[00:47:40.189 --> 00:47:41.970]  In the new San Francisco, the new LA.
[00:47:42.030 --> 00:47:45.631]  Well, it's because my ancestors have been here since the 1820s.
[00:47:46.851 --> 00:47:52.673]  And my ancestors are buried here and they're buried in Central Texas and East Texas and North Texas.
[00:47:52.733 --> 00:47:57.855]  And my family's connected to Travis and the whole nine yards.
[00:47:57.915 --> 00:48:05.737]  So it's really hard to abandon the state, but it is very close to turning deep evil blue via election fraud.
[00:48:05.777 --> 00:48:08.858]  And so that's why I still stay in my beloved state.
[00:48:10.077 --> 00:48:17.782]  Though I do look enviously at Florida and its ongoing awakening.
[00:48:19.183 --> 00:48:21.124]  That's because they got good leadership there, like DeSantis.
[00:48:21.144 --> 00:48:26.728]  But if you just joined us, I dropped the mega super giant bombshell that you've already all heard about.
[00:48:27.483 --> 00:48:40.026]  In a lot of other very respected and also prestigious medical reports and studies going back two decades, but really intensifying the last decade, that they tried to create coronavirus vaccines.
[00:48:40.046 --> 00:48:49.508]  Because coronaviruses kill pigs, they kill cows, they kill sheep, they kill chickens, they kill geese, they kill ducks, they kill turkey.
[00:48:51.149 --> 00:48:51.449]  And so,
[00:48:52.998 --> 00:48:55.360]  They've been trying to figure this out for a long time to save money.
[00:48:55.380 --> 00:49:00.985]  Because you get a virus in one of these big coops, you know, kill a couple hundred thousand of your chickens, you lose your ass.
[00:49:01.786 --> 00:49:08.752]  Well, they've been searching for decades, and when they give them to these animals, they end up dying of autoimmune diseases.
[00:49:08.812 --> 00:49:13.616]  Their bodies eat holes in their brains, their hearts, their lungs, and their arteries.
[00:49:15.962 --> 00:49:17.003]  Overhead shot, please.
[00:49:17.243 --> 00:49:19.184]  Well, this just got brought to my attention.
[00:49:19.224 --> 00:49:21.585]  I went and checked it on the University of Texas website.
[00:49:22.045 --> 00:49:28.889]  This is the University of Texas Biological Research Center, Level 4, one of the most prestigious in the world.
[00:49:30.110 --> 00:49:36.934]  Immunization with SARS coronavirus vaccines leads to pulmonary autoimmune response.
[00:49:37.974 --> 00:49:39.555]  Immunopathology is what that means.
[00:49:39.895 --> 00:49:42.677]  And it says this had autoimmune responses in the mice.
[00:49:43.717 --> 00:49:44.417]  We test on mice.
[00:49:44.437 --> 00:49:46.258]  It's very similar to us with the way they react.
[00:49:46.638 --> 00:49:48.339]  And then they have to show the photos and all of it.
[00:49:48.779 --> 00:49:51.240]  And they have the control group, the non-control group, the control group.
[00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:56.021]  You know, those that were challenged got really sick.
[00:49:56.501 --> 00:49:57.962]  Those that weren't given it didn't get sick.
[00:49:58.782 --> 00:50:04.804]  They did a bunch of studies, and it's got all the photos of the holes eaten in their lungs, their brains, and their hearts.
[00:50:05.544 --> 00:50:07.585]  And they say you should not try these vaccines.
[00:50:07.885 --> 00:50:09.966]  They did three different vaccines, three different types.
[00:50:11.081 --> 00:50:11.822]  And they all failed.
[00:50:11.882 --> 00:50:12.923]  They all killed the animals.
[00:50:13.624 --> 00:50:28.221]  So, that's the University of Texas, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, the University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, United States of America, Center for Biodefense, what's weapons lab?
[00:50:29.341 --> 00:50:30.582]  And Emerging Disease.
[00:50:31.062 --> 00:50:42.869]  The University of Texas, Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, United States of America, Department of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, worked on it, Houston, Texas, United States of America, Department of Molecular Biology, Baylor College.
[00:50:42.889 --> 00:50:43.889]  So UT and Baylor.
[00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:45.951]  At the Bioweapon Lab.
[00:50:47.251 --> 00:50:48.812]  Level 4, Bioweapon Lab.
[00:50:49.713 --> 00:50:50.153]  Highest level.
[00:50:51.345 --> 00:50:58.349]  So, what do you think of that and what's your take and what's your experience been as a medical worker, as a doctor, as a nurse?
[00:50:59.249 --> 00:51:01.870]  Let's go ahead and talk to Francesco.
[00:51:01.930 --> 00:51:03.811]  I really appreciate holding from Pennsylvania.
[00:51:03.851 --> 00:51:05.472]  Go ahead and tell us your view on this.
[00:51:06.413 --> 00:51:07.213]  Hi, Mr. Jones.
[00:51:07.313 --> 00:51:10.234]  First of all, I've been trying to tell you this for a few years.
[00:51:10.295 --> 00:51:12.195]  I was blessed enough to get through today.
[00:51:12.736 --> 00:51:17.438]  I have never heard you speak so much about the Lord Jesus Christ as I have in the last few years.
[00:51:18.158 --> 00:51:20.900]  And I have to say, it's got to be because your wife is a blessing to you.
[00:51:21.943 --> 00:51:23.144]  So I just wanted to say that.
[00:51:23.184 --> 00:51:25.806]  I've been wanting to tell you that for a couple of years now.
[00:51:26.627 --> 00:51:31.811]  I've been in long-term care for about 30 years, mostly geriatric nursing.
[00:51:31.851 --> 00:51:33.232]  I've never seen anything like this.
[00:51:33.872 --> 00:51:34.973]  It scares me to death.
[00:51:36.114 --> 00:51:44.581]  My residents got the Pfizer shot, the first one in January, and then they got the second one in February, and all of them started with
[00:51:45.449 --> 00:51:49.190]  People who are normally coherent, alert and oriented, you would talk to them.
[00:51:49.210 --> 00:51:52.091]  It was like they weren't even in the room with you.
[00:51:52.151 --> 00:51:53.111]  They weren't coherent.
[00:51:53.471 --> 00:51:55.392]  It was like your words were going right through them.
[00:51:55.972 --> 00:52:00.093]  One of my residents in particular was fine one day, got the second shot.
[00:52:00.573 --> 00:52:01.793]  I was off for a couple of days.
[00:52:01.853 --> 00:52:02.413]  I came back.
[00:52:02.453 --> 00:52:03.193]  They said he was dead.
[00:52:04.414 --> 00:52:10.295]  My coworkers who have gotten the Pfizer shot are complaining of tingling in their hands, tingling in their feet.
[00:52:10.735 --> 00:52:11.876]  They're missing a lot of work.
[00:52:11.896 --> 00:52:13.276]  They're calling out left and right.
[00:52:14.011 --> 00:52:20.996]  Um, one of the nurses I work with, uh, on a regular basis says she can't even work in her garden anymore because her hands are numb.
[00:52:21.857 --> 00:52:23.678]  So, I mean, this is, this is horrific.
[00:52:24.159 --> 00:52:26.180]  And of course they tell you what that is, that's Guillain-Barré.
[00:52:26.260 --> 00:52:26.340]  Hm.
[00:52:27.521 --> 00:52:29.383]  Uh, no.
[00:52:29.843 --> 00:52:30.003]  No.
[00:52:30.403 --> 00:52:31.284]  No, not in this case.
[00:52:31.324 --> 00:52:32.225]  She's not the only one.
[00:52:32.245 --> 00:52:35.467]  There are other nurses that are also complaining of the same thing.
[00:52:35.487 --> 00:52:36.808]  Listen, you're the nurse, you know more than I do.
[00:52:36.828 --> 00:52:41.472]  I'm just saying they admit these shots have been causing Guillain-Barré, which is people getting numb, but please continue.
[00:52:42.694 --> 00:52:48.197]  Yeah, and these people are, I mean, having trouble walking, some of these nurses.
[00:52:48.237 --> 00:52:49.137]  And they're young people.
[00:52:49.537 --> 00:52:49.957]  They're young.
[00:52:49.977 --> 00:52:52.018]  They're in their 30s, early 40s.
[00:52:52.078 --> 00:52:53.239]  Some of them are in their 20s.
[00:52:53.879 --> 00:53:03.724]  And, you know, so many of my colleagues and co-workers that I've talked to before the vaccine was given out, you know, they swore up and down they weren't going to get it.
[00:53:03.804 --> 00:53:05.045]  Oh, no, I'm not going to get it.
[00:53:05.105 --> 00:53:06.345]  It's experimental.
[00:53:06.745 --> 00:53:08.766]  I'm not going to put that poison in my body.
[00:53:08.786 --> 00:53:09.507]  They all got it.
[00:53:09.687 --> 00:53:09.967]  Why?
[00:53:11.758 --> 00:53:12.418]  I don't understand.
[00:53:12.438 --> 00:53:14.660]  Well, I would warn those that have already gotten it.
[00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:16.500]  The more they take, the more they're going to get sick.
[00:53:16.540 --> 00:53:17.381]  The studies are there.
[00:53:17.961 --> 00:53:19.882]  China won't take the mRNA vaccine.
[00:53:19.902 --> 00:53:20.523]  Neither will India.
[00:53:20.543 --> 00:53:21.143]  They've banned it.
[00:53:21.503 --> 00:53:24.304]  So when they act like you're a weirdo for not wanting to do it, they're wrong.
[00:53:25.145 --> 00:53:25.765]  What have you done?
[00:53:25.805 --> 00:53:27.626]  Have you refused or are you currently working?
[00:53:28.607 --> 00:53:32.889]  Oh, I'm working, but I'm waiting for the day when they tell me I have to take it or I lose my job.
[00:53:32.909 --> 00:53:33.909]  They'll take me off the schedule.
[00:53:33.949 --> 00:53:34.750]  I'm sure it's coming.
[00:53:35.070 --> 00:53:36.491]  Well, you know it violates the...
[00:53:38.208 --> 00:53:40.730]  Nuremberg Code to make you take an experimental vaccine.
[00:53:40.770 --> 00:53:42.311]  God bless you, ma'am, and thank you for your testimony.
[00:53:42.811 --> 00:53:45.673]  Although that wasn't showing, nothing is.
[00:53:45.714 --> 00:53:49.776]  And that's what I hear from people that work in nursing homes, people that work in hospitals.
[00:53:49.817 --> 00:53:50.577]  I'm being told the same thing.
[00:53:50.737 --> 00:53:52.458]  And you see it in the news, and you got it in the studies.
[00:53:52.779 --> 00:53:53.879]  It's not anecdotal, folks.
[00:53:55.080 --> 00:54:01.185]  That's why they made it emergency authorization so it didn't go through human trials, because the trials would scientifically show what happened.
[00:54:02.483 --> 00:54:05.607]  But they lie on TV and tell you, oh, it's been tested.
[00:54:05.647 --> 00:54:06.428]  It's totally safe.
[00:54:06.729 --> 00:54:07.770]  No one's ever gotten hurt.
[00:54:08.071 --> 00:54:08.932]  I'm John Oliver.
[00:54:09.252 --> 00:54:10.414]  Don't listen to Alex Jones.
[00:54:10.554 --> 00:54:11.075]  Wow.
[00:54:11.736 --> 00:54:13.138]  Just showed you the University of Texas.
[00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:16.242]  They go, oh, this is a different vaccine.
[00:54:17.163 --> 00:54:17.464]  Really?
[00:54:18.541 --> 00:54:23.545]  People are getting blood clots and heart attacks with all of the two different types, mRNA and virus vector.
[00:54:24.046 --> 00:54:27.089]  China and others are doing whole virus, which is radiated.
[00:54:27.489 --> 00:54:28.410]  So did Australia.
[00:54:28.630 --> 00:54:32.353]  They had to pull it because people were getting HIV false positive tests.
[00:54:33.074 --> 00:54:33.795]  Because...
[00:54:35.330 --> 00:54:38.191]  It's a cold virus with HIV delivery system welded onto it.
[00:54:38.451 --> 00:54:39.631]  We told you 14 months ago.
[00:54:39.651 --> 00:54:41.912]  Because that's what all the scientists that scanned it said.
[00:54:42.632 --> 00:54:43.032]  All right.
[00:54:43.372 --> 00:54:45.233]  Let's talk to Travis in Wisconsin.
[00:54:45.253 --> 00:54:47.053]  Travis, thanks for holding her on the air.
[00:54:47.073 --> 00:54:47.893]  You're a medical worker.
[00:54:47.913 --> 00:54:48.673]  Tell us what's going on.
[00:54:50.734 --> 00:54:51.214]  Hey, Alex.
[00:54:52.234 --> 00:54:54.175]  Long-time listener, first-time caller.
[00:54:54.535 --> 00:54:57.916]  I'm nervous, but sorry about that.
[00:54:58.436 --> 00:55:02.117]  I've been working in the caregiving business since I was 18 years old.
[00:55:03.877 --> 00:55:05.578]  I haven't seen anything like this, man.
[00:55:05.658 --> 00:55:07.098]  It's insane.
[00:55:08.719 --> 00:55:17.123]  During the first wave of COVID, we had, I think, probably five or six months where nobody was infected.
[00:55:17.163 --> 00:55:19.944]  And then we had probably, I think, four or five cases.
[00:55:20.984 --> 00:55:24.086]  And I had one gentleman who was 100 years old, no symptoms whatsoever.
[00:55:24.106 --> 00:55:26.326]  We had to quarantine everybody in the whole place.
[00:55:27.887 --> 00:55:28.507]  He recovered.
[00:55:28.627 --> 00:55:29.428]  He's still living.
[00:55:29.448 --> 00:55:31.709]  I had another
[00:55:33.924 --> 00:55:38.587]  In her mid 80s, no symptoms, totally recovered, fine.
[00:55:38.647 --> 00:55:40.028]  Everybody recovered just fine.
[00:55:40.808 --> 00:55:45.131]  And then we have this Satan shot, I guess you'd say.
[00:55:46.412 --> 00:55:55.118]  And had one man passed out on his, for God's sakes.
[00:55:56.038 --> 00:55:58.520]  And he was gone for a couple of months and came back.
[00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:02.261]  I just, I don't understand what's going on with this thing.
[00:56:02.281 --> 00:56:03.562]  Everybody's waking up to it.
[00:56:03.622 --> 00:56:09.005]  Everybody that's in my facility, you know, they say something's not right here.
[00:56:09.025 --> 00:56:20.471]  I got one family that I take care of, their parents, he runs a funeral home locally here, and I just so happened to talk to him yesterday.
[00:56:21.172 --> 00:56:23.753]  And him and his wife were like, yeah, something's not right here.
[00:56:23.973 --> 00:56:25.053]  Something's not adding up.
[00:56:25.153 --> 00:56:27.374]  And, you know, I just wanted to make my point.
[00:56:27.394 --> 00:56:32.595]  Let me guess, they're now seeing more dead bodies than they were supposedly under COVID with the old people dying, because that's what we're seeing.
[00:56:32.615 --> 00:56:34.735]  And now they're saying, oh, people are dying of COVID.
[00:56:34.995 --> 00:56:38.076]  But most people in the hospital actually are there from the COVID vaccine.
[00:56:39.316 --> 00:56:39.536]  Right.
[00:56:39.676 --> 00:56:39.897]  Yeah.
[00:56:40.157 --> 00:56:43.457]  And it's everybody that I talk to.
[00:56:43.477 --> 00:56:45.798]  I mean, I shouldn't say everybody, but, you know,
[00:56:46.511 --> 00:56:52.618]  I'd say probably at least 70% are waking up to the fact that the math doesn't add up.
[00:56:52.878 --> 00:56:54.400]  Well, protect those old people!
[00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:55.761]  Protect those old people!
[00:56:56.042 --> 00:56:58.284]  They're going to order you to keep shooting them up until they die.
[00:56:58.965 --> 00:57:01.308]  It's a giant test, a Milgram experiment.
[00:57:01.328 --> 00:57:01.928]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:03.350 --> 00:57:07.534]  Ladies and gentlemen, this just broke out of the official Communist Chinese Daily.
[00:57:08.612 --> 00:57:13.014]  The Communist Chinese government is telling its population you don't have to take the vaccines.
[00:57:13.654 --> 00:57:15.675]  Less than 5% of the Japanese have taken it.
[00:57:15.815 --> 00:57:19.477]  They know what's going on and they've banned the U.S.
[00:57:19.517 --> 00:57:20.477]  vaccines in China.
[00:57:20.517 --> 00:57:21.297]  So has India.
[00:57:21.818 --> 00:57:24.399]  Because they know, I guess China runs the U.S.
[00:57:24.439 --> 00:57:24.639]  now.
[00:57:25.099 --> 00:57:29.381]  This is a bioweapon attack to stun us, poison us, and give us so many sick people.
[00:57:29.741 --> 00:57:31.582]  We will fully collapse from this if we don't.
[00:57:32.062 --> 00:57:34.043]  Hell, they've already shot up probably 40% of the public.
[00:57:35.205 --> 00:57:36.826]  And then we've got such Stockholm Syndrome.
[00:57:36.846 --> 00:57:37.926]  I mean, this is just insane.
[00:57:39.867 --> 00:57:51.573]  University of Texas officially put out a report eight years ago, nine years ago, saying you can't take any COVID vaccines, any coronavirus vaccines, because it causes your body to attack itself.
[00:57:52.233 --> 00:57:54.335]  Let's talk to a medical doctor, they say.
[00:57:54.475 --> 00:57:55.355]  She goes by Jeff.
[00:57:56.456 --> 00:58:00.838]  Says family is all medical workers on vaccines.
[00:58:00.898 --> 00:58:02.959]  So thanks for joining us from South Carolina.
[00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:11.884]  Hi Alex, I don't know if you remember but we spoke I think like two months ago now on one of your shows for about 20-25 minutes.
[00:58:12.384 --> 00:58:19.948]  There was a segment where I was speaking about COVID vaccines and previous type of COVID vaccines for the veterinary community.
[00:58:20.488 --> 00:58:22.929]  My grandmother had passed away after the COVID vaccine.
[00:58:22.970 --> 00:58:24.870]  That's right, I remember you were on for several segments.
[00:58:24.931 --> 00:58:26.251]  I really appreciate you coming on.
[00:58:26.952 --> 00:58:29.613]  Yeah, so I've been trying to call for the last week and this is just
[00:58:30.533 --> 00:58:32.634]  Serendipitous that I called and got on right away.
[00:58:33.154 --> 00:58:36.594]  So, I wanted to give y'all and the whole audience an update.
[00:58:36.915 --> 00:58:54.139]  Since my grandmother passed away, my great-uncle passed away, and the same exact scenario, within two weeks of receiving the Pfizer, first actually, the first COVID vaccine, he was actually more clinically healthy, but the same situation, came down with COVID-like symptoms and died, and he was COVID negative.
[00:58:54.559 --> 00:58:59.940]  And yet, that side of my family still cannot understand that maybe the COVID vaccine was part of it.
[00:59:00.653 --> 00:59:12.124]  I know plenty of people since then who have had pretty significant reactions from crazy appendicitis leading to a septic abdomen to tinnitus, which I just heard last night and Tucker Carlson was talking about it.
[00:59:12.466 --> 00:59:20.887]  Apparently tinnitus, like one third of the tinnitus or ringing in your ears cases that have been reported so far this year have all potentially been COVID vaccine related.
[00:59:21.107 --> 00:59:24.268]  And for folks who don't know, that's usually when nerves are dying or being eaten.
[00:59:24.288 --> 00:59:26.989]  I mean, this is causing an autoimmune response all over the body.
[00:59:27.289 --> 00:59:28.829]  That's what the UT study says.
[00:59:29.109 --> 00:59:35.810]  What do you think of them knowing this study from a bioweapons research lab on par and above the Wuhan lab?
[00:59:36.090 --> 00:59:41.091]  This was a global advisory by the lab that protects against these things saying, don't do it.
[00:59:42.389 --> 00:59:43.029]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:59:43.130 --> 00:59:47.272]  I mean, the thing is, we know about this, but right now this is all about social pressure.
[00:59:47.292 --> 00:59:51.095]  And what I specifically wanted to speak about is being in South Carolina.
[00:59:51.115 --> 01:00:03.242]  I don't know if you know this or if your listeners know this, but Houston Methodist in Texas is the big hospital system that's been in the news over the last month to tune up two months about requiring mandatory COVID vaccines for employees.
[01:00:03.663 --> 01:00:08.566]  So the Medical University of South Carolina, which is the largest hospital system in South Carolina,
[01:00:09.031 --> 01:00:09.752]  I don't know.
[01:00:21.713 --> 01:00:24.396]  To be vaccinated by June of 2021.
[01:00:24.956 --> 01:00:27.759]  This came down the pipeline within the last couple weeks.
[01:00:28.659 --> 01:00:33.544]  Originally, they put out an email saying it was just for their management staff and their leadership.
[01:00:33.564 --> 01:00:35.025]  Sure, they always are expanding it.
[01:00:35.065 --> 01:00:36.246]  That's the plan of this.
[01:00:36.546 --> 01:00:44.734]  So, bottom line here, are people waking up that this is experimental, it violates the Nuremberg Code, and you can show them mainline studies saying don't do it?
[01:00:46.084 --> 01:00:46.644]  Absolutely.
[01:00:46.685 --> 01:00:49.507]  People definitely are, especially because now it's in our backyard.
[01:00:49.567 --> 01:01:06.819]  I think even those who say that they've been awake this whole time, you're not really going to understand how this is rapidly falling apart and you're quickly going to be expected to do things against your will or lose your job and your way to support your family, which is something that my personal family is struggling with right now because of this.
[01:01:08.033 --> 01:01:19.345]  The issue is, on a statewide level, those of us who have been trying to get in with local committee people, local elections, sending letters to local representatives, even Henry McMaster,
[01:01:19.912 --> 01:01:30.918]  These bills for protecting people, especially health care workers, against being required to take this mandatory COVID experimental gene therapy have not been passed through in Congress.
[01:01:31.258 --> 01:01:32.999]  Well, listen, I appreciate you calling.
[01:01:33.059 --> 01:01:34.059]  I'm glad you got on.
[01:01:34.099 --> 01:01:37.521]  If you want to come on as a guest and keep your name private, stay on.
[01:01:37.541 --> 01:01:38.121]  We'll get your number.
[01:01:38.181 --> 01:01:39.282]  If not, I understand.
[01:01:39.322 --> 01:01:40.002]  I appreciate your call.
[01:01:40.022 --> 01:01:41.163]  We're going to move to get everybody on.
[01:01:42.153 --> 01:01:44.854]  Ladies and gentlemen, this doesn't protect you from COVID-19.
[01:01:44.874 --> 01:01:46.294]  You don't go back to normal when you get it.
[01:01:46.834 --> 01:01:49.815]  And you certainly, your body is going to be riddled with problems.
[01:01:50.215 --> 01:01:52.855]  They picked something that attacks the cardiovascular system.
[01:01:53.035 --> 01:01:54.696]  It's going to kill a lot of old people right away.
[01:01:55.836 --> 01:01:57.596]  But it's going to kill others down the road.
[01:01:57.917 --> 01:02:01.097]  And then as they say, you got to get more, more, more, because it quote, doesn't work.
[01:02:01.357 --> 01:02:02.137]  Well, it is working.
[01:02:02.878 --> 01:02:05.638]  It gives you cardiovascular disease amongst other things.
[01:02:06.799 --> 01:02:07.959]  And it attacks your uterus.
[01:02:08.099 --> 01:02:08.559]  This is it.
[01:02:09.974 --> 01:02:11.715]  That's what the former VP of Pfizer says.
[01:02:12.095 --> 01:02:13.235]  It's a depopulation weapon.
[01:02:13.315 --> 01:02:16.737]  Go to the live show feed of the broadcast.
[01:02:17.137 --> 01:02:18.117]  Put it back on screen, please.
[01:02:18.578 --> 01:02:20.478]  With the headline, Global Bombshell.
[01:02:20.979 --> 01:02:27.822]  University of Texas Research Team Warns Coronavirus Vaccines Cause Massive Heart Attacks, Strokes, Blood Clots.
[01:02:27.922 --> 01:02:28.422]  It says it!
[01:02:28.442 --> 01:02:29.642]  It says don't take it!
[01:02:30.083 --> 01:02:30.863]  It's definitive!
[01:02:32.099 --> 01:02:37.442]  And under the live show feed, scroll down, under the video of the show that you share is the study.
[01:02:37.943 --> 01:02:39.344]  It's on that page.
[01:02:39.424 --> 01:02:40.424]  Save some lives now.
[01:02:40.844 --> 01:02:41.365]  Fight back.
[01:02:41.665 --> 01:02:42.806]  That's why they've been censoring everybody.
[01:02:42.826 --> 01:02:45.988]  They can only get away with this covert attack if no one's warning them.
[01:02:47.829 --> 01:02:50.711]  I can say shame on Google, Facebook, and Twitter, but they're all on board with this.
[01:02:50.771 --> 01:02:52.852]  I mean, think of the employees there going along with this.
[01:02:52.892 --> 01:02:54.193]  This is just madness.
[01:02:54.213 --> 01:02:55.494]  This is total depopulation.
[01:02:56.014 --> 01:02:57.355]  All right, who's been home the longest here?
[01:02:59.813 --> 01:03:06.776]  Let's go ahead and talk to Brian N. PA is a nurse, wife is a doc.
[01:03:07.196 --> 01:03:08.016]  Tell us what you're seeing.
[01:03:09.837 --> 01:03:10.317]  Yes, sir.
[01:03:10.517 --> 01:03:11.317]  How are you doing, Alex?
[01:03:11.557 --> 01:03:12.798]  I'm pretty freaked out.
[01:03:12.858 --> 01:03:14.138]  Go ahead.
[01:03:14.158 --> 01:03:14.418]  Me too.
[01:03:14.778 --> 01:03:17.779]  So I'm a healthcare worker in long-term care.
[01:03:17.959 --> 01:03:19.140]  So I've seen the virus.
[01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:25.582]  I've seen the vaccine come along and I've had to deal with all the guidances that we have to as employers.
[01:03:26.192 --> 01:03:29.013]  Give me a favor, you're kind of muffling your phone.
[01:03:29.033 --> 01:03:30.174]  Talk right into it.
[01:03:55.896 --> 01:03:59.478]  Sorry, so the question is, who are you reporting it to?
[01:03:59.918 --> 01:04:00.859]  Who can you report it to?
[01:04:01.099 --> 01:04:08.523]  Well, no one, because basically, it's not going to be correlated to the vaccine.
[01:04:09.544 --> 01:04:20.110]  So if this would have been a normal vaccine study over years and years and years, we would have percentages and numbers and age groups of people having all these associated side effects, but
[01:04:20.831 --> 01:04:22.052]  Now we're not going to.
[01:04:22.392 --> 01:04:26.495]  Now we're going to see all these people and the doctors are going to know, but they're never going to correlate.
[01:04:26.515 --> 01:04:27.876]  They're going to say, well, that guy had COVID.
[01:04:28.496 --> 01:04:28.896]  That's right.
[01:04:28.916 --> 01:04:31.538]  And then when the doctor complains, they're going to get censored or fired.
[01:04:31.578 --> 01:04:32.679]  They've thought this out.
[01:04:32.719 --> 01:04:33.920]  They've war-gamed it all out.
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:36.781]  That's why they didn't do this long-term study.
[01:04:37.122 --> 01:04:43.426]  That's why they didn't do the animal study, because UT and Wuhan and Chapel Hill and everybody already did it.
[01:04:43.986 --> 01:04:45.987]  And they found, wow, this kills the animals.
[01:04:46.027 --> 01:04:46.828]  They went, perfect.
[01:04:47.108 --> 01:04:47.909]  Give it to the humans.
[01:04:48.469 --> 01:04:49.970]  Isn't that diabolical, brother?
[01:04:52.165 --> 01:04:52.686]  It's sad.
[01:04:52.766 --> 01:04:53.447]  It's just sad.
[01:04:53.868 --> 01:05:01.800]  And now we're dealing with reopening and guidances and how to deal with vaccinated versus unvaccinated.
[01:05:02.205 --> 01:05:05.567]  And what it's coming down to now is more division and labeling people.
[01:05:05.767 --> 01:05:06.728]  Well, oh, yeah.
[01:05:06.788 --> 01:05:09.610]  Oh, the Yankees, the Mets, you aren't vaccinated.
[01:05:09.670 --> 01:05:11.171]  You go to a separate area.
[01:05:11.451 --> 01:05:12.531]  You don't get the good seats.
[01:05:12.832 --> 01:05:13.232]  It's yes.
[01:05:13.812 --> 01:05:16.734]  And everybody's I mean, are the medical workers not seeing through this?
[01:05:17.154 --> 01:05:18.275]  I mean, it makes people sick.
[01:05:18.355 --> 01:05:19.016]  It kills people.
[01:05:19.076 --> 01:05:19.636]  It's in the studies.
[01:05:19.696 --> 01:05:20.076]  It doesn't.
[01:05:20.276 --> 01:05:22.858]  And that's why they didn't do the studies, because they already did the studies.
[01:05:22.878 --> 01:05:23.398]  You understand that?
[01:05:23.418 --> 01:05:26.040]  I think they're getting.
[01:05:28.488 --> 01:05:30.930]  That psychologically forced into it.
[01:05:31.030 --> 01:05:37.093]  Maybe some of them are as weak as, well, I really wanted to go on my vacation to the Caribbean, so I'll get it.
[01:05:37.493 --> 01:05:37.994]  Exactly.
[01:05:38.014 --> 01:05:38.934]  Folks, do not take it.
[01:05:38.974 --> 01:05:39.675]  It's bioweapon.
[01:05:39.695 --> 01:05:40.075]  Thank you, sir.
[01:05:41.996 --> 01:05:44.958]  Ladies and gentlemen, Bill Gates said he wants to depopulate the planet.
[01:05:44.978 --> 01:05:45.878]  The UN wants to do it.
[01:05:45.918 --> 01:05:46.839]  The globalists want to do it.
[01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:51.602]  But we know it's a specific attack on Europe, Australia, New Zealand, the US.
[01:05:53.396 --> 01:05:57.359]  That's where they're hitting people with the mRNA vaccines and the virus vector vaccines.
[01:05:57.999 --> 01:06:00.381]  And China, in fact, guys, I saw the article printed for me.
[01:06:00.421 --> 01:06:01.021]  Bring it out, please.
[01:06:01.802 --> 01:06:08.527]  China just came out and told its provinces, do not do forced inoculations and don't try to threaten people with social credit score to do it.
[01:06:09.187 --> 01:06:11.829]  But that's what's happening here, because we're the target.
[01:06:12.930 --> 01:06:20.115]  We're meant to be gotten rid of, and it's actuated and designed to really hit baby boomers that are retiring now or hitting retirement age to kill you.
[01:06:22.028 --> 01:06:25.131]  It's a very sophisticated bioweapon in these vaccines.
[01:06:26.252 --> 01:06:27.213]  And the facts are coming.
[01:06:27.233 --> 01:06:28.154]  You're hearing the medical workers.
[01:06:28.174 --> 01:06:29.074]  You're seeing the studies.
[01:06:29.195 --> 01:06:31.156]  I mean, this is the reality.
[01:06:31.176 --> 01:06:33.318]  And they wouldn't have gotten away with this without the censorship.
[01:06:33.659 --> 01:06:34.780]  That's why it's life and death.
[01:06:34.820 --> 01:06:38.523]  You download the video today of this interview, these calls, and you share it.
[01:06:38.843 --> 01:06:39.884]  And you take clips of it.
[01:06:39.924 --> 01:06:41.846]  You put it on Twitter and Facebook and YouTube.
[01:06:42.086 --> 01:06:43.047]  So what if you get banned?
[01:06:43.067 --> 01:06:44.569]  You're going to be killed anyways.
[01:06:45.865 --> 01:06:46.745]  How's it going Alex?
[01:06:46.825 --> 01:06:47.405]  First time caller.
[01:06:47.425 --> 01:06:50.986]  I just want to start out by saying thank you for waking me up.
[01:07:12.964 --> 01:07:15.906]  I haven't really been into politics until the whole COVID thing happened.
[01:07:16.246 --> 01:07:19.969]  I started listening to you, and you just really woke me up.
[01:07:21.230 --> 01:07:32.579]  So, about a month ago, my sister, she took the Pfizer vaccine, and about two weeks later after she took it, her baby started having seizures.
[01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:37.482]  And they're trying to link it to, you know, her husband.
[01:07:37.662 --> 01:07:42.106]  It runs in his family, but I just think it's kind of weird that after a week,
[01:07:43.180 --> 01:07:46.243]  Of her taking the vaccine, the baby started having these seizures.
[01:07:46.263 --> 01:07:47.304]  You know what type she took?
[01:07:47.324 --> 01:07:48.745]  Pfizer.
[01:07:49.466 --> 01:07:51.007]  Yeah, that's the mRNA vaccine.
[01:07:51.027 --> 01:07:52.149]  That's what I thought I heard you say.
[01:07:52.169 --> 01:08:03.860]  Pfizer specifically in their own public trials, they didn't do real trials, they just gave the public, said we do have concern about shedding, we have concern about breastfeeding women.
[01:08:04.180 --> 01:08:05.321]  And did I hear you right?
[01:08:05.361 --> 01:08:06.102]  Was she breastfeeding?
[01:08:07.182 --> 01:08:07.582]  No, I'm good.
[01:08:21.007 --> 01:08:22.048]  You know, kids don't get it.
[01:08:22.068 --> 01:08:27.691]  Oh, CNN's headline was like, young people and mothers should take it to protect babies.
[01:08:28.152 --> 01:08:34.516]  Yeah, I'm not laughing at your sister, I'm just laughing at how women think the system loves them and it's totally killing them.
[01:08:34.876 --> 01:08:39.059]  And so the baby was fine and then had convulsions after breast milk?
[01:08:40.300 --> 01:08:44.342]  Yeah, so he started having seizures and they were minor seizures at first.
[01:08:44.683 --> 01:08:49.506]  So they took him into the hospital and they gave him some seizure medicine and then
[01:08:50.752 --> 01:08:55.695]  It took care of it for 3-4 days and then my mom was watching him.
[01:08:56.636 --> 01:08:59.057]  She's off a couple days a week and watches him.
[01:08:59.357 --> 01:09:04.060]  She was watching him and noticed that he started having seizures again and they were more intense and more severe.
[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:05.961]  So he went back in again.
[01:09:05.981 --> 01:09:07.923]  They switched the medicine.
[01:09:08.063 --> 01:09:10.184]  Well here's the deal, obviously she's still breastfeeding.
[01:09:14.107 --> 01:09:18.548]  Yeah, no, she needs to stop breastfeeding, and it'll probably stop.
[01:09:18.608 --> 01:09:19.548]  God bless you, sir.
[01:09:19.768 --> 01:09:20.788]  I gotta jump everybody on.
[01:09:20.808 --> 01:09:22.529]  We could talk for ten hours, couldn't we?
[01:09:22.729 --> 01:09:26.310]  You know, I promised to take my four-year-old daughter fishing.
[01:09:28.070 --> 01:09:38.852]  I forgot this Saturday, so I might come in and do a special three, four-hour commercial-free show so all you guys can call in, but if the crew tells me a time that they can come in Friday night,
[01:09:40.188 --> 01:09:42.371]  Or maybe Sunday night, I should, you know what?
[01:09:42.972 --> 01:09:48.319]  Sunday night, I should do the Sunday Night Live that Owen usually does.
[01:09:48.399 --> 01:09:50.822]  It only has six minutes and ads an hour anyways.
[01:09:51.443 --> 01:09:56.569]  And so Sunday night, 4 to 8 p.m., I will do nothing but take calls.
[01:09:58.037 --> 01:09:59.778]  Do you love the vaccine or do you hate it?
[01:10:00.398 --> 01:10:03.339]  And you hear, of course, what you're getting is one horrible story after another.
[01:10:03.499 --> 01:10:05.200]  Then I have the actual UT science.
[01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:06.540]  This isn't anecdotal.
[01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:07.261]  They say, don't take it.
[01:10:07.321 --> 01:10:09.101]  It'll cause seizures, cause blood clots.
[01:10:09.122 --> 01:10:09.962]  It'll cause brain damage.
[01:10:10.162 --> 01:10:11.743]  It'll cause your body to attack your own self.
[01:10:11.763 --> 01:10:15.724]  And then the baby drinks that in with mother's milk that it takes to totally absorb.
[01:10:16.024 --> 01:10:17.905]  The first few months of mother's milk has colostrum.
[01:10:18.085 --> 01:10:20.046]  All of her immunity is given to the baby.
[01:10:22.087 --> 01:10:23.087]  It's the ultimate vaccine.
[01:10:23.127 --> 01:10:25.328]  And now it's getting mRNA.
[01:10:27.537 --> 01:10:29.258]  To attack his own little proteins.
[01:10:31.079 --> 01:10:33.781]  Man, turning the mother's milk into poison.
[01:10:34.361 --> 01:10:36.222]  And they even... Pfizer says it's that.
[01:10:36.783 --> 01:10:37.983]  But they don't tell you, do they?
[01:10:38.364 --> 01:10:42.266]  Because they know she's not going to go, I want to protect my baby from COVID.
[01:10:44.027 --> 01:10:45.168]  How many women have to die?
[01:10:45.208 --> 01:10:45.628]  How many men?
[01:10:45.648 --> 01:10:46.269]  How many babies?
[01:10:47.429 --> 01:10:48.970]  Actually, folks are going to like it.
[01:10:48.990 --> 01:10:51.212]  The more die, we're seeing people go, well, I'm going to...
[01:10:52.140 --> 01:10:53.561]  I had a miscarriage when I took the shot.
[01:10:53.601 --> 01:10:56.143]  I'm gonna, if I'm pregnant again, I'll take one again.
[01:10:56.804 --> 01:10:57.905]  Never admitting you're wrong.
[01:10:57.945 --> 01:11:00.667]  Just doubling down, doubling down, doubling down.
[01:11:02.008 --> 01:11:07.712]  Heard that medical doctor call in, her family, when her mother died, and then, now the uncle died.
[01:11:08.172 --> 01:11:11.215]  But the family's like, we're gonna keep giving the old folks these shots!
[01:11:11.915 --> 01:11:13.216]  Dammit, we're not gonna stop.
[01:11:13.997 --> 01:11:14.177]  Ever.
[01:11:16.596 --> 01:11:18.419]  Because we're not going to admit we helped kill somebody.
[01:11:18.439 --> 01:11:19.300]  We're not going to admit we're wrong.
[01:11:19.340 --> 01:11:20.161]  We never do that.
[01:11:20.742 --> 01:11:22.424]  The media told us it's the right thing to do.
[01:11:23.626 --> 01:11:25.348]  Lee in Oklahoma is a paramedic.
[01:11:26.570 --> 01:11:27.111]  What's your view?
[01:11:27.151 --> 01:11:27.732]  What are you seeing?
[01:11:31.397 --> 01:11:34.019]  Appreciate everything that you've done for everybody, Alex.
[01:11:34.079 --> 01:11:35.640]  We appreciate you greatly.
[01:11:35.700 --> 01:11:37.101]  I mean, I'm under attack, too.
[01:11:37.442 --> 01:11:38.422]  I need you to get out of this.
[01:11:38.442 --> 01:11:38.883]  You need me.
[01:11:38.923 --> 01:11:39.863]  We're all under attack.
[01:11:40.584 --> 01:11:42.766]  It'd be like we're all in a lifeboat with a hole in it.
[01:11:42.806 --> 01:11:46.168]  We're trying to plug the hole and we're bailing water and you're thanking me.
[01:11:46.428 --> 01:11:47.209]  I'm trying to put a plug.
[01:11:47.229 --> 01:11:48.590]  You're like, thank you for plugging the boat.
[01:11:48.610 --> 01:11:51.432]  And I'm like, I'm like, Lee, we're in this damn boat together.
[01:11:51.452 --> 01:11:52.173]  Thank you, too.
[01:11:52.213 --> 01:11:52.533]  Go ahead.
[01:11:53.536 --> 01:11:58.200]  Well, long-time paramedic, been a paramedic about 30 years, highly educated guy.
[01:11:58.601 --> 01:12:01.723]  I try to express to people about what's going on.
[01:12:01.743 --> 01:12:05.487]  I explain to them, hey, I'm a long-time healthcare professional.
[01:12:05.547 --> 01:12:07.148]  I've got a lot of education behind me.
[01:12:07.208 --> 01:12:08.709]  It's taught me how to research.
[01:12:09.410 --> 01:12:11.532]  And people still look at you like you're crazy.
[01:12:12.216 --> 01:12:15.838]  And you know, we transport a lot of people, a lot of elderly people.
[01:12:16.018 --> 01:12:25.442]  So, one of the things that I've gone to asking patients now, whenever they present, they present with severe weakness, severe respiratory difficulty, nausea, vomiting.
[01:12:26.663 --> 01:12:28.844]  Basically, I'll ask, have you had the COVID shot?
[01:12:29.344 --> 01:12:30.865]  Yes, we've had the COVID shot.
[01:12:31.005 --> 01:12:36.427]  A lot of these patients that we're seeing are COVID shot related patients.
[01:12:36.667 --> 01:12:39.429]  You know, I mean, they present with debilitating weakness,
[01:12:40.939 --> 01:12:44.700]  You know, it's hard to pin down exactly when death happens.
[01:12:44.981 --> 01:12:49.302]  You know, it's like, you know, some, you know, a couple of weeks, some a couple of days after the fact.
[01:12:49.722 --> 01:12:52.824]  These nursing homes just push this vaccine like crazy.
[01:12:53.344 --> 01:13:01.287]  My wife and I have basically sold our property and are literally moving off the grid because we know that it's going to eventually come to the point
[01:13:02.051 --> 01:13:06.335]  That we are not, my employers are going to push me to taking this vaccine.
[01:13:06.995 --> 01:13:08.176]  And I refuse to take it.
[01:13:08.637 --> 01:13:10.018]  We'll never take this thing.
[01:13:10.698 --> 01:13:12.039]  I've seen too much bad outcomes.
[01:13:12.140 --> 01:13:18.165]  But our bosses get on Facebook and they present themselves, showing themselves like we're heroes.
[01:13:18.205 --> 01:13:19.686]  You know, we're taking these vaccines.
[01:13:19.726 --> 01:13:20.607]  We're taking these shots.
[01:13:20.647 --> 01:13:21.748]  You guys should do the same.
[01:13:22.288 --> 01:13:23.209]  No, I won't.
[01:13:23.829 --> 01:13:24.590]  I refuse to.
[01:13:25.111 --> 01:13:30.215]  And me and my wife, we've prepared that we're going to eventually, I'm probably going to lose my job.
[01:13:31.275 --> 01:13:33.776]  And that's pretty much where we're at with it.
[01:13:33.996 --> 01:13:34.996]  We refuse to take it.
[01:13:35.136 --> 01:13:36.157]  Well, you're not the only one.
[01:13:36.197 --> 01:13:42.979]  The biggest exodus out of the cities ever has happened, and we're going to form our own communities, and we're going to watch everybody else sadly die.
[01:13:43.059 --> 01:13:47.361]  And that's the really sad part about folks living under Stockholm Syndrome, Lee, is they won't listen.
[01:13:47.801 --> 01:13:48.881]  Warn those families.
[01:13:49.282 --> 01:13:50.242]  Warn those people.
[01:13:50.682 --> 01:13:51.882]  Warn old folks you see.
[01:13:52.003 --> 01:13:52.543]  Warn others.
[01:13:52.563 --> 01:13:53.183]  God bless you.
[01:13:54.623 --> 01:13:55.764]  Let's jam in another call.
[01:13:55.804 --> 01:13:58.065]  Let's go ahead and talk to
[01:14:00.066 --> 01:14:01.487]  Rebecca in Minnesota.
[01:14:01.507 --> 01:14:02.347]  Go ahead, Rebecca.
[01:14:02.367 --> 01:14:03.587]  She's a nurse.
[01:14:03.707 --> 01:14:07.649]  Okay, I'm going to go down the line here quick.
[01:14:08.029 --> 01:14:14.312]  Three issues with the Pfizer vaccination that I personally experienced.
[01:14:15.432 --> 01:14:24.596]  My friend, who is a nurse also, has issues now with her breast and her mammograms have been positive and suspicious.
[01:14:25.576 --> 01:14:29.618]  My other nurse friend has tested positive after her first
[01:14:30.436 --> 01:14:32.158]  We're good to go!
[01:14:51.670 --> 01:14:52.230]  They have.
[01:14:52.590 --> 01:14:54.291]  My mom has not taken the vaccine.
[01:14:54.331 --> 01:14:55.312]  Rebecca, don't hang up.
[01:14:55.392 --> 01:15:01.254]  I've got Nick Fuentes popping on with an update for one segment, but I'm going to come back to you, because everything you said.
[01:15:01.314 --> 01:15:02.255]  They admit heart attacks.
[01:15:02.715 --> 01:15:04.676]  They admit the breast and the uterus swelling up.
[01:15:04.736 --> 01:15:06.136]  They say, oh, don't worry, it's not cancer.
[01:15:06.716 --> 01:15:08.817]  And they admit the other things you were mentioning.
[01:15:09.118 --> 01:15:11.759]  So you're dead on target, and you're a nurse, and people need to hear this.
[01:15:12.079 --> 01:15:13.159]  And I can hear it in your voice.
[01:15:13.219 --> 01:15:14.400]  My voice is quivering, too.
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:15.820]  We're being killed.
[01:15:16.201 --> 01:15:19.162]  And it's through the system we're supposedly trusting, the medical system.
[01:15:19.682 --> 01:15:23.111]  And the medical people are going to be the key of turning this around because they know what's going on.
[01:15:23.131 --> 01:15:23.612]  We'll be right back.
[01:15:24.642 --> 01:15:27.825]  Well, I'll give Bill Gates and the UN and the globalists this.
[01:15:27.905 --> 01:15:34.310]  They've got huevos the size of the Grand Canyon, or the size of the Grand Tetons, the size of the planet.
[01:15:35.511 --> 01:15:46.900]  UT official bioweapons lab, level 4, found that all coronavirus vaccines cause bleeding in the lungs, the brain, the heart, and blood clots on a massive scale.
[01:15:47.301 --> 01:15:49.543]  In some cases, the majority of lab rats died.
[01:15:51.329 --> 01:15:52.309]  And that's the headline.
[01:15:52.349 --> 01:16:01.292]  Immunization with SARS coronavirus vaccines leads to pulmonary immunopathology with all the challenged subjects, all the lab animals.
[01:16:03.313 --> 01:16:06.673]  That is from 2012 and there's a bunch of other reports coming out.
[01:16:06.733 --> 01:16:11.755]  They knew this, they did it, that way they could plausibly deny when your loved one has a heart attack.
[01:16:12.665 --> 01:16:15.907]  Or a stroke or a blood clot, and you see what's coming out with all the vaccines.
[01:16:16.287 --> 01:16:17.708]  Please don't forget, we're Lister-supported.
[01:16:17.788 --> 01:16:20.870]  Turbo Force, 10 hours clean energy, back in stock, 40% off.
[01:16:21.610 --> 01:16:26.513]  Also, we have the great Ultimate Fish Roll, highest grade fish roll, great for your heart, your brain, your whole body.
[01:16:27.033 --> 01:16:29.174]  It is 50% off.
[01:16:29.574 --> 01:16:31.675]  And X2, the good halogen, 50% off.
[01:16:32.056 --> 01:16:37.579]  And of course, vitamin D3 for your immune system, winter sun, back in stock, 50% off as well, and that funds the operation.
[01:16:37.939 --> 01:16:41.201]  All right, I was gonna get him on for an hour today, and I appreciate him joining us.
[01:16:42.295 --> 01:16:49.397]  But I've got to have Greg Reese and others and special reports I cut coming this morning because I got called away with a family court thing I got to deal with.
[01:16:49.417 --> 01:16:50.577]  You know, I'm always under siege here.
[01:16:50.617 --> 01:16:51.057]  That's fine.
[01:16:51.717 --> 01:16:53.578]  But that's coming up and I'll be back this afternoon.
[01:16:53.598 --> 01:16:56.759]  But she's just there to give us an update and some breaking news.
[01:16:57.279 --> 01:16:59.479]  Nick Foyntes put on a no-fly list.
[01:16:59.999 --> 01:17:01.100]  They won't even tell him why.
[01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:02.860]  They now admit he's on a no-fly list.
[01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:07.201]  And so he has retained a prominent civil rights lawyer, Norm Pattison.
[01:17:07.221 --> 01:17:08.442]  They have a big announcement to make.
[01:17:08.762 --> 01:17:09.882]  So thanks for coming on, Nick.
[01:17:11.084 --> 01:17:12.165]  Thank you so much for having me.
[01:17:12.185 --> 01:17:12.905]  I appreciate it.
[01:17:13.785 --> 01:17:15.226]  Make the big announcement for us, please.
[01:17:16.006 --> 01:17:16.867]  Absolutely, yes.
[01:17:16.927 --> 01:17:23.890]  So I was on your show last week to talk about my placement on the no-fly list, which we suspect was for political reasons.
[01:17:23.990 --> 01:17:28.693]  And you brought on the great lawyer Norm Pattis, and we got a chance to talk a little bit.
[01:17:29.173 --> 01:17:34.736]  And I actually gave him a call after your show, and I've now retained him to represent me in a case against the TSA.
[01:17:35.851 --> 01:17:38.133]  We should be filing, I believe, next week.
[01:17:38.213 --> 01:17:41.796]  So, we're going to take it to the courts against the TSA and the federal government.
[01:17:43.663 --> 01:18:03.355]  Give us updates on what's happened to you because now we have this new Pentagon report I covered in the first hour from DARPA saying anyone that thinks the government's corrupt or is too big or overstepped its bounds will be targeted by the Pentagon, by the CIA, and by a Black Lives Matter leader who is now in command of them.
[01:18:03.435 --> 01:18:07.538]  I mean, I read this DARPA report and just it was even worse than I thought it could be.
[01:18:09.073 --> 01:18:09.614]  Absolutely.
[01:18:09.634 --> 01:18:12.075]  And it gets worse, it seems, with each passing day.
[01:18:12.296 --> 01:18:15.998]  And it's, you know, it's interesting because I used to talk about this on my show a lot.
[01:18:16.479 --> 01:18:29.629]  I know that a lot of my viewers used to say things like, during the 2020 election, they would say, well, you know, maybe it's not such a bad thing if Biden gets elected because things are going to have to get worse before they get better, before people are going to wake up and see what's going on.
[01:18:30.444 --> 01:18:47.332]  You know, I used to say on my show that what's going to happen first and foremost, right out of the gate, is that life is going to get a lot harder, a lot faster for people like you and I, actually, for people like you, Alex, and people like me, for the real dissidents, for the real people that are challenging the American regime and the American system.
[01:18:47.572 --> 01:18:50.733]  It's going to get much worse very quickly for us before anybody else.
[01:18:50.773 --> 01:18:52.474]  And this is exactly what you're seeing.
[01:18:52.494 --> 01:18:56.316]  At a breakneck pace, the Biden administration is using the full weight
[01:18:57.077 --> 01:19:04.123]  Oh, the federal government now to persecute anybody that opposes and dissents against their regime, against their administration.
[01:19:04.284 --> 01:19:07.406]  And, you know, for a long time it was big tech censorship.
[01:19:07.466 --> 01:19:15.314]  It was sort of this corporate tyranny that was working against conservatives, working against patriots, right-wing people, even under the Trump administration.
[01:19:15.634 --> 01:19:22.260]  But now people are seeing what that looks like when it's not just the corporate tyrants, but it's also with the full assent and the full
[01:19:23.004 --> 01:19:25.386]  The DHS, Department of Homeland Security, is using private companies to spy
[01:19:39.194 --> 01:19:42.256]  On patriots, on people that are dissenting against the regime.
[01:19:42.276 --> 01:19:45.938]  And then if they give a designation, you are now a domestic terrorist.
[01:19:45.958 --> 01:19:52.102]  I mean, I read this and it read like a cartoon of like what bad guys would be in like a novel or something.
[01:19:52.543 --> 01:19:59.407]  I mean, they literally say, if they don't trust the government and believe it's too big, they are terrorists and we need to take them out.
[01:20:00.267 --> 01:20:05.271]  And anyone that thinks that the nation state should be here is a white supremacist.
[01:20:05.331 --> 01:20:07.132]  I mean, it reads like a cartoon book.
[01:20:08.362 --> 01:20:09.903]  Literally, yeah, it literally does.
[01:20:09.943 --> 01:20:19.706]  It reads like, you know, the most alarmist predictions of what the left would become, where the government would go from 10, 20, 30 years ago, and it's transpiring right now.
[01:20:19.746 --> 01:20:20.226]  What are they doing?
[01:20:20.286 --> 01:20:22.907]  As Biden goes, whites don't get any farm aid.
[01:20:23.267 --> 01:20:24.708]  Whites don't get any student aid.
[01:20:24.948 --> 01:20:28.329]  Whites, I mean, they're actually just announcing whites are bad all over TV.
[01:20:29.662 --> 01:20:32.323]  It's true, it's true, and we've been saying this for years.
[01:20:32.403 --> 01:20:33.844]  Whites are now being targeted.
[01:20:34.064 --> 01:20:46.051]  I think it's basically the creation of like this racial caste system in America because clearly there's these double standards where there's one set of rules that applies to one group of people and one set of rules that applies to everybody else.
[01:20:46.131 --> 01:20:52.294]  And you look at like the BLM protests last year, this is maybe the best example, and these people are tearing up
[01:20:52.984 --> 01:20:56.767]  Portland, Seattle, Chicago, D.C., Minneapolis, famously.
[01:20:57.127 --> 01:20:59.548]  And it's BLM and it's Antifa and that's just fine.
[01:20:59.568 --> 01:21:05.712]  You know, they go out in the middle of Seattle and they call it the Capitol Hill or the Capitol Autonomous Zone.
[01:21:05.933 --> 01:21:12.317]  And they literally declare, I mean, what else do you call that other than an insurrection when they say, we're declaring we have our own autonomy?
[01:21:12.617 --> 01:21:19.099]  And the fire department, when they declared the autonomous zone, said that they wouldn't even shut off their water, their electricity.
[01:21:19.139 --> 01:21:21.540]  They said they wouldn't even move in and disrupt the barricades.
[01:21:21.820 --> 01:21:26.262]  They were allowed to declare their own autonomous country in the middle of a major city.
[01:21:26.302 --> 01:21:27.182]  And that was last year.
[01:21:27.222 --> 01:21:28.583]  That was Antifa BLM.
[01:21:29.324 --> 01:21:35.911]  This year, you've got a protest at the Capitol, which the most that you could say is it was a protest that got a little bit out of hand.
[01:21:35.951 --> 01:21:38.813]  There was trespassing and there was disorderly conduct.
[01:21:38.974 --> 01:21:47.742]  These are misdemeanors, hardly represents a- But they call it the insurrection, and they show photos of you and I at the Georgia Capitol with State Rep.
[01:21:47.782 --> 01:21:50.885]  Jones, and go, look at them directing the attack in the Capitol!
[01:21:51.185 --> 01:21:52.066]  I want them in prison!
[01:21:52.126 --> 01:21:52.827]  I want them dead!
[01:21:53.027 --> 01:21:53.528]  People go, hey,
[01:21:53.988 --> 01:21:56.609]  That's from November 18th, and they just ignore it.
[01:21:56.909 --> 01:21:59.830]  And then mainstream media runs with it and says, there they are in the Capitol.
[01:22:00.070 --> 01:22:03.211]  It's just, they've decided to just do whatever's evil.
[01:22:03.311 --> 01:22:06.473]  Like, whatever the maximum default evil is, they're doing it.
[01:22:06.853 --> 01:22:08.573]  Where is this, and it seems like it's working!
[01:22:08.813 --> 01:22:11.054]  Everyone just bows down and says, I'm sorry!
[01:22:11.334 --> 01:22:12.535]  You're right, I'm evil!
[01:22:14.019 --> 01:22:14.319]  It is!
[01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:19.083]  It is working, and that's the scary thing is that most of the population is just going along with this.
[01:22:19.484 --> 01:22:34.356]  It's disturbing because, you know, there used to be a time when people had some kind of a grasp on this concept that the government is going to accuse its opponents and people that dissent against it of being terrorists, of being violent, of being a threat, and there was a time when people understood
[01:22:35.111 --> 01:22:40.194]  Liberals and conservatives, that that was always going to be the pretext to criminalize dissent.
[01:22:40.254 --> 01:22:53.422]  That all the government has to do is say, well, anybody that criticizes us, anybody that's against us is a threat to society, they're a terrorist, and that justifies, that's the pretext for ever-expanding government control, ever-expanding tyranny.
[01:22:53.682 --> 01:22:55.243]  There was a time when people understood that.
[01:22:55.523 --> 01:22:59.285]  Now people are just readily going along with it, and I see it on Twitter all the time.
[01:22:59.605 --> 01:23:00.266]  When I got put
[01:23:01.079 --> 01:23:02.200]  That's right, let's be clear.
[01:23:23.611 --> 01:23:24.512]  No judge, no jury.
[01:23:24.532 --> 01:23:26.012]  They won't even tell you why you're on it.
[01:23:26.032 --> 01:23:27.533]  They're like, well, he deserves it.
[01:23:27.913 --> 01:23:30.834]  Thinking if they grovel the system, they'll be all right.
[01:23:30.874 --> 01:23:35.876]  This is anti-American, anti-freedom, Tony behavior, but you got a good lawyer.
[01:23:35.936 --> 01:23:36.796]  You're going to fall suit.
[01:23:37.096 --> 01:23:39.317]  There's a process here and people should support you.
[01:23:39.337 --> 01:23:42.018]  You know, buy some of those great America first hats you have.
[01:23:42.078 --> 01:23:42.538]  I love them.
[01:23:42.598 --> 01:23:43.778]  I'm America first.
[01:23:43.978 --> 01:23:48.500]  We're all America first here and support you because your fight is our fight.
[01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:51.120]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:52.521]  And thanks so much for saying that.
[01:23:52.541 --> 01:23:54.342]  Yeah, we're on America First Live.
[01:23:54.382 --> 01:23:57.023]  We have our hats at nicolaschafewences.com.
[01:23:57.323 --> 01:24:00.844]  And it is so important because, you know, we're going up against the whole system, as you know.
[01:24:00.864 --> 01:24:03.665]  And I'm sure that you're in a similar situation.
[01:24:03.705 --> 01:24:07.807]  We've got the entire beast, the entire system bearing down on us.
[01:24:08.234 --> 01:24:16.800]  It's the corporate tyrants, it's the federal government, and you know, somebody like me, I'm an independent operation, much like yourself, and so when it comes to that, we all have to stick together.
[01:24:16.820 --> 01:24:20.022]  Absolutely, let me add this in closing, because you're going to be on next week for a full hour with us.
[01:24:20.722 --> 01:24:30.609]  You can't fly down here, maybe we'll send a bus to get you, but seriously, now they're coming out and saying, use the Pentagon and the same groups against vaccine dissenters.
[01:24:30.809 --> 01:24:31.830]  The exact same playbook.
[01:24:32.050 --> 01:24:35.232]  They're criminalizing dissent on even medical issues now.
[01:24:36.462 --> 01:24:37.863]  You've been saying it for decades.
[01:24:37.883 --> 01:24:39.745]  You've been warning about this stuff for decades.
[01:24:39.765 --> 01:24:42.527]  The war on our biological integrity, and that's exactly right.
[01:24:42.547 --> 01:24:45.650]  They're going to show up to your house, and they're going to stick you with the needle.
[01:24:45.710 --> 01:24:47.752]  I'm sure a gunpoint within this decade.
[01:24:48.352 --> 01:24:49.373]  That's where all this is headed.
[01:24:49.453 --> 01:24:53.477]  Oh, they say the contact tracers are coming next year when they release the new virus that Gates promises is coming.
[01:24:53.757 --> 01:24:58.281]  All right, Nick Fuentes, we're going to talk to you again very, very soon, as soon as the suit gets filed.
[01:24:58.581 --> 01:25:00.303]  We really appreciate you staying in contact.
[01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:02.381]  All right, thank you so much.
[01:25:02.462 --> 01:25:03.483]  I'll talk to you soon, okay?
[01:25:03.503 --> 01:25:03.823]  Thank you.
[01:25:03.923 --> 01:25:04.584]  All right, there he goes.
[01:25:04.965 --> 01:25:07.148]  Yeah, we're all in this together.
[01:25:07.248 --> 01:25:09.851]  So, promote his show, promote my show, start your own show.
[01:25:10.111 --> 01:25:11.874]  Whatever you do, speak out, get involved.
[01:25:12.014 --> 01:25:13.396]  Every little bit counts.
[01:25:13.516 --> 01:25:16.459]  Every order at infowarthore.com gets a bunch of bumper stickers.
[01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:18.581]  In fact, I just told them today, order even more.
[01:25:18.601 --> 01:25:21.902]  We're going to put even more free bumper stickers in every order just to get them out there.
[01:25:22.122 --> 01:25:23.083]  Third Dimension, fight back.
[01:25:23.123 --> 01:25:23.363]  All right.
[01:25:23.683 --> 01:25:24.383]  More of your calls.
[01:25:24.403 --> 01:25:25.564]  I'm going to get a few more in here.
[01:25:25.904 --> 01:25:27.365]  Finish it with Rebecca and a few others.
[01:25:27.805 --> 01:25:31.847]  And then my special report on pedophilia hidden in plain view.
[01:25:31.867 --> 01:25:34.248]  All right, folks.
[01:25:35.128 --> 01:25:35.849]  I only got a few minutes.
[01:25:35.869 --> 01:25:37.289]  I want to take your calls all day.
[01:25:37.329 --> 01:25:41.471]  This Sunday, 4 to 8 p.m., I'm going to host four hours.
[01:25:41.651 --> 01:25:42.552]  And in two hours of it,
[01:25:44.045 --> 01:25:46.587]  Only got six minutes of ads an hour, so I have a lot of time to get your calls.
[01:25:47.827 --> 01:25:50.469]  We're going to take your calls, whether you love the vaccine, hate it, for your stories.
[01:25:50.929 --> 01:25:53.110]  But everybody I don't get to here, we're going to get your number if you want.
[01:25:53.170 --> 01:25:54.411]  I promise I'm going to call you tomorrow.
[01:25:54.431 --> 01:25:56.252]  We're going to do it and get them back on.
[01:25:56.672 --> 01:25:57.753]  I'm going to try to finish up right here.
[01:25:58.413 --> 01:25:59.414]  Rebecca, you're a nurse.
[01:25:59.454 --> 01:26:04.877]  You were really listing all the terrible things you've seen happen after people take these vaccines.
[01:26:04.937 --> 01:26:05.978]  What else would you like to add?
[01:26:05.998 --> 01:26:11.481]  This is also affecting people that have not been vaccinated as well.
[01:26:12.242 --> 01:26:23.788]  Um, my mother, who hasn't had any cardiac issues for four years, um, has recently had two episodes of atrial fibrillation, which needed cardioversion.
[01:26:24.529 --> 01:26:28.331]  Um, her boyfriend is vaccinated and of course she spends a lot of time with him.
[01:26:29.251 --> 01:26:36.495]  Um, I also have a niece that has a roommate that was just, um, got her second shot.
[01:26:37.516 --> 01:26:41.438]  And ever since that, my niece is now having heavy periods.
[01:26:42.034 --> 01:26:42.755]  Every other week.
[01:26:42.875 --> 01:26:45.296]  And she's on the birth control pill.
[01:26:45.516 --> 01:26:49.980]  And by the way, when the shots all started six months ago in England, it was heart attacks and the same thing.
[01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:52.161]  And then we found out the literature, they knew that.
[01:26:52.461 --> 01:26:57.525]  The call board is full of people with friends and family and having heart attacks after the shot.
[01:26:58.245 --> 01:26:58.926]  This is insane.
[01:26:59.546 --> 01:27:02.188]  Did it shock you to hear the UT report about heart attacks?
[01:27:02.388 --> 01:27:03.529]  That they knew this 12 years ago?
[01:27:03.549 --> 01:27:04.069]  Or 9 years ago?
[01:27:06.283 --> 01:27:09.367]  Yeah, well, I'm not surprised by anything.
[01:27:09.447 --> 01:27:20.782]  And then I did also want to add last night, I had a friend who is a vet from the Gulf War, and he drives patients back and forth, volunteers for vaccinations.
[01:27:21.497 --> 01:27:31.102]  And he recently has had two episodes of weird skin reactions where he's had rashes all over his body, having to go to the emergency department twice.
[01:27:31.163 --> 01:27:35.205]  That's what they say, is it takes over your cells and puts out these RNA streams.
[01:27:35.685 --> 01:27:40.388]  And that's even what NPR scientists were on and said, we think this will create super viruses.
[01:27:40.788 --> 01:27:41.548]  God bless you, ma'am.
[01:27:41.588 --> 01:27:42.369]  It's the ultimate weapon.
[01:27:42.389 --> 01:27:44.730]  They turn us into weapon machines.
[01:27:44.790 --> 01:27:47.272]  Like he said, soon terrorists will release weapons.
[01:27:48.152 --> 01:27:52.774]  Gates thinks humanity's a terrorist, so he's saying he made us the terrorists to terrorize ourselves.
[01:27:53.254 --> 01:27:54.435]  Having humans kill humans.
[01:27:54.495 --> 01:27:56.396]  It's the perfect globalist operation.
[01:27:57.716 --> 01:27:58.557]  Let's talk to Mike.
[01:27:58.737 --> 01:28:00.578]  He's a retired medical worker.
[01:28:00.598 --> 01:28:01.518]  Let's talk about shedding.
[01:28:01.818 --> 01:28:02.719]  Thanks for calling.
[01:28:02.739 --> 01:28:03.259]  Go ahead, Mike.
[01:28:03.279 --> 01:28:05.040]  Hey, Alex.
[01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:07.641]  I think this is a bit more diabolical, actually.
[01:28:08.001 --> 01:28:13.463]  You know, you've lifted the veil for me after all these years of listening, where it was entertainment initially.
[01:28:13.503 --> 01:28:16.765]  Now it's just, we should have listened to you a long time ago, man.
[01:28:18.222 --> 01:28:27.326]  I think, possibly, from just talking to people, is this vaccine is being used as almost a way to identify.
[01:28:27.386 --> 01:28:34.148]  You separate people by those who will take it, those who won't, and of those who will take it, those who survive it.
[01:28:34.908 --> 01:28:41.631]  And then, those who survive it can end up spreading these spike proteins to those who don't take it.
[01:28:43.952 --> 01:28:46.893]  Your comments about removing yourself from
[01:28:47.682 --> 01:28:52.604]  Society as it's evolving to be is probably the only answer.
[01:28:53.104 --> 01:28:54.805]  I don't think there is any other answer.
[01:28:54.845 --> 01:28:56.585]  Yeah, my spirit's never been wrong.
[01:28:56.805 --> 01:28:59.526]  For six months, I've been, get your family alone.
[01:28:59.546 --> 01:29:02.528]  And I'm not a agoraphobic person.
[01:29:03.208 --> 01:29:04.028]  I don't like being alone.
[01:29:04.068 --> 01:29:08.250]  But my gut is, get your children, get out of there.
[01:29:08.270 --> 01:29:12.371]  We're just going to have to take our vitamins, our minerals, and pray to God and transcend this.
[01:29:12.431 --> 01:29:15.272]  But yeah, this is the beginning of the end, brother.
[01:29:15.292 --> 01:29:15.873]  Can't you see it?
[01:29:16.093 --> 01:29:16.833]  They've made their move.
[01:29:17.950 --> 01:29:19.232]  Yeah, they have.
[01:29:19.492 --> 01:29:28.923]  You were right all along, and when I'm asked what to do, I say, stay healthy, find a supplement supplier you trust, and, you know, just
[01:29:31.089 --> 01:29:31.669]  Stay healthy.
[01:29:32.090 --> 01:29:32.630]  Be prepared.
[01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:50.661]  I've got to go.
[01:29:50.761 --> 01:29:53.123]  I've got to go deal with court stuff that just popped up yesterday.
[01:29:54.164 --> 01:29:57.187]  And so, I promise you, John, don't forget the call screener.
[01:29:57.687 --> 01:30:03.553]  I'm going to have Athena, Nicole, and Brian all on as my guests at 11.30 tomorrow, 30 minutes into the show.
[01:30:03.633 --> 01:30:06.295]  I will go to you unless a nuclear bomb goes off or something.
[01:30:06.515 --> 01:30:07.816]  We're going to continue to open the phones up.
[01:30:07.917 --> 01:30:08.117]  All right.
[01:30:08.457 --> 01:30:11.280]  I shot two special reports this morning when I found out I had to go early.
[01:30:11.860 --> 01:30:12.420]  Those are going to air.
[01:30:12.460 --> 01:30:13.141]  They're very important.
[01:30:13.161 --> 01:30:18.564]  Gregory comes in, live on air, and then he's going to show some of his clips and talk about some things.
[01:30:18.945 --> 01:30:20.005]  Infowars.com.
[01:30:20.025 --> 01:30:20.926]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:30:21.226 --> 01:30:22.607]  Thank you all for your support and prayers.
[01:30:22.667 --> 01:30:25.869]  Remember, God is still in charge, even though Bill Gates is playing God.
[01:30:41.471 --> 01:30:45.652]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:30:46.393 --> 01:30:50.574]  In this special report, I'm going to break something down that is hiding in plain view.
[01:30:51.194 --> 01:30:55.715]  Something that is a scientific, political, biological fact.
[01:30:56.916 --> 01:31:10.360]  And that is that the Tavistock Institute was tasked in the 50s and 60s, along with other major globalist think tanks of psychology, to develop a plan to end war.
[01:31:12.040 --> 01:31:30.044]  And to end war, they came back with the answer, as other major scientific think tanks had, you need to end the normal biological action of humans, because just like two bulls will fight in a field over cows for dominance, or two male eagles will fight over the female, males are the reason we have war, they said.
[01:31:30.665 --> 01:31:35.046]  And so we need to end the male gender as it's known to stop war.
[01:31:35.866 --> 01:31:37.866]  Well, this is not the first time this has been pushed.
[01:31:40.985 --> 01:31:58.170]  Arabs and the Ottoman Empire, but going back thousands of years before the Ottoman Empire, before they were even Muslims, the Arabic peoples, and many other groups as well, would kidnap European and also African slaves, make them slaves, and they would cut their genitals off.
[01:31:58.710 --> 01:31:59.731]  They were called eunuchs.
[01:32:00.131 --> 01:32:06.733]  Just type in eunuchs in the Ottoman Empire, eunuchs in the ancient world, and that's how they controlled them.
[01:32:07.193 --> 01:32:07.313]  Yes.
[01:32:30.911 --> 01:32:32.032]  There's nothing new under the sun.
[01:32:32.072 --> 01:32:33.833]  There's just modern ways of doing it.
[01:32:33.873 --> 01:32:40.137]  So I'm going to break down here very quickly in the next eight minutes of this segment exactly what's happening.
[01:32:40.157 --> 01:32:41.418]  But first, let's start here.
[01:32:41.658 --> 01:32:45.581]  This is just the last few days of persecution that ties into this.
[01:32:45.961 --> 01:32:47.803]  Street preacher, 71, arrested for
[01:32:50.799 --> 01:32:59.185]  Distressing public with homophobic rants at Speaker's Corner in London, where for hundreds of years people have total free speech.
[01:33:00.106 --> 01:33:00.907]  Here is another one.
[01:33:02.168 --> 01:33:10.094]  Out of Canada, father jailed for calling his transgender child who was born female his daughter and denouncing her medical treatment.
[01:33:10.834 --> 01:33:12.055]  He is now in jail.
[01:33:13.596 --> 01:33:19.461]  Finnish politician faces six years in prison for citing Bible, criticizing homosexuality.
[01:33:20.694 --> 01:33:22.995]  That's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:33:23.815 --> 01:33:32.359]  Dad who referenced trans child's biological sex also had his child taken and is now being sterilized in Dallas, Texas.
[01:33:33.060 --> 01:33:35.641]  There are so many examples of these, they make your head spin.
[01:33:36.021 --> 01:33:36.942]  Now let's move on.
[01:33:37.082 --> 01:33:39.543]  You're like, wait a minute, eunuchs and trans children.
[01:33:39.703 --> 01:33:40.283]  It's the same thing.
[01:33:42.244 --> 01:33:44.145]  The Carnegie Endowment, the Rockefeller Endowment,
[01:33:45.418 --> 01:33:46.479]  We're good to go.
[01:34:03.514 --> 01:34:27.520]  Said we need to basically end normal biological sex and create people in test tubes and have a suboid class that serves us of Diminutive goblin like creatures that these are quotes from him and then us the beautiful elites that are all perfectly bred So it's eugenics it goes back to Plato in ancient Greece and of course that was 2,300 years ago and and so now how do you sterilize children?
[01:34:28.362 --> 01:34:29.843]  How do you convince them not to procreate?
[01:34:30.243 --> 01:34:34.765]  You tell them it's their decision and you make it a huge new human right.
[01:34:35.546 --> 01:34:45.891]  And then you have psychologists in the public and private schools telling particularly at-risk children, autistic, Down syndrome and other disorders, that you get attention when you're a girl!
[01:34:46.511 --> 01:34:54.738]  And you bring in girls' toys and dolls and bows and girls give them attention and they decide, I want to be a girl because the boys are mean.
[01:34:55.059 --> 01:34:56.019]  Boys are competitive.
[01:34:56.280 --> 01:34:57.180]  Boys play sports.
[01:34:57.341 --> 01:34:58.301]  Boys fight.
[01:34:58.862 --> 01:35:00.764]  And it's easier just to say, you're a girl.
[01:35:01.024 --> 01:35:04.106]  And little boys are used to the maternal instinct, even if they don't have a mother.
[01:35:04.907 --> 01:35:08.310]  And so they bond to the psychologist, the psychiatrist, that poses that.
[01:35:08.350 --> 01:35:17.297]  I'm going to show you in a moment where they then deliver the children, once they believe they're a girl, at usually about age seven, two large pedophile rings that rape them.
[01:35:17.317 --> 01:35:20.580]  I'm going to show you main stream news here in a moment.
[01:35:21.361 --> 01:35:24.583]  In the War on Traditional Gender Roles.
[01:35:24.643 --> 01:35:28.366]  Very important article that you need to read.
[01:35:29.349 --> 01:35:30.090]  Let's continue.
[01:35:30.590 --> 01:35:34.293]  Berlin authorities place children with pedophiles for 30 years.
[01:35:34.333 --> 01:35:39.116]  DW.com, the biggest TV station in Germany, highly respected.
[01:35:39.456 --> 01:35:40.777]  The equivalent of like PBS.
[01:35:41.638 --> 01:35:42.338]  Do you see that?
[01:35:42.839 --> 01:35:54.387]  For decades they placed small children as young as three, mainly boys, with convicted pedophiles and said we're creating a new family, the nuclear family is bad, and we're going to place them with pedophiles all over Germany.
[01:35:55.987 --> 01:36:14.970]  Tens of thousands alone in Berlin alone, and they would have large sex parties where the nuns would also take young boys, particularly the main group that are abused, because you know, they're boys, they're tough, they can take it, and would rent them out for the weekend to giant sex parties where children, again, as young as three, would be gang raped by up to 100 men.
[01:36:15.030 --> 01:36:18.991]  Read it for yourself, this is your liberal love.
[01:36:19.651 --> 01:36:25.332]  Continuing, police in Germany investigate 30,000 potential suspects in pedophile probe run by the government.
[01:36:27.352 --> 01:36:30.694]  Child sex abuse trial, the horrors of Germany's activities.
[01:36:30.774 --> 01:36:31.815]  Go look it up for yourself.
[01:36:31.835 --> 01:36:32.655]  This is just one case.
[01:36:33.135 --> 01:36:36.637]  Now, let's move on to the modern eunuchs.
[01:36:37.218 --> 01:36:40.520]  Autistic children pushed to become transgender.
[01:36:40.900 --> 01:36:44.022]  National Review, even the London Guardian, a decade ago reported on this.
[01:36:44.102 --> 01:36:54.528]  I had a Liberal Member of Parliament on who talked about how more than half the autistic children in his jurisdiction, the people he represented in several towns and cities,
[01:36:55.308 --> 01:37:00.151]  We're already on chemical sterilization or physically having genitals removed by age 10.
[01:37:00.451 --> 01:37:01.632]  Now it's age 7.
[01:37:01.852 --> 01:37:04.293]  They're putting them on chemicals as young as age 3.
[01:37:04.373 --> 01:37:05.934]  I'm going to show you that in a moment.
[01:37:06.314 --> 01:37:07.675]  So, this has been going on for years.
[01:37:08.395 --> 01:37:11.457]  The transgender movement targets autistic children.
[01:37:12.458 --> 01:37:14.259]  Very important article you should read.
[01:37:15.579 --> 01:37:16.480]  Pedophilia, rape.
[01:37:17.651 --> 01:37:23.137]  Autistic girl thousands of times from when she was just three years old.
[01:37:23.537 --> 01:37:24.658]  That's there in the UK.
[01:37:25.993 --> 01:37:31.577]  Largest study to date confirms overlap between autism and gender diversity.
[01:37:31.717 --> 01:37:33.319]  Oh yes, gender diversity.
[01:37:33.759 --> 01:37:35.520]  Dysphoria and gender fluidity.
[01:37:35.881 --> 01:37:37.062]  Go read the actual studies.
[01:37:37.962 --> 01:37:42.466]  Trans people are up to six times more likely to have autism and related conditions.
[01:37:42.546 --> 01:37:43.546]  Landmark study confirms.
[01:37:43.967 --> 01:37:53.914]  So, vaccines that are contaminated, autoimmune responses, and pesticides cause brain damage about 10 times more often than boys, because the blood-brain barrier is thinner on males.
[01:37:54.915 --> 01:38:00.817]  And when the brain damage happens, then they come next and then sterilize you, which is something that Planned Parenthood has pushed for a long time.
[01:38:01.117 --> 01:38:04.699]  So is the EU sterilizing the mentally handicapped.
[01:38:04.719 --> 01:38:11.821]  They make you handicapped, then they sterilize you, and they make it a huge, wonderful, beautiful cause celeb out of Hollywood.
[01:38:12.242 --> 01:38:15.723]  So if you criticize it, you're a hateful person of children that have their identity.
[01:38:16.243 --> 01:38:19.506]  They're not of age to make these decisions, even at 15, much less 3.
[01:38:20.167 --> 01:38:26.473]  And psychological warfare is used on them to trick them and make their identity this way, to mutilate their bodies.
[01:38:27.034 --> 01:38:28.475]  Remember all the famous eugenicists?
[01:38:29.036 --> 01:38:33.400]  Oregon was the last state to stop sterilizing women that flunked out of high school?
[01:38:34.221 --> 01:38:35.082]  That was the prerequisite?
[01:38:35.842 --> 01:38:37.143]  Or quote, low IQ?
[01:38:37.303 --> 01:38:41.486]  They were still sterilizing women in the early 80s in Oregon.
[01:38:41.546 --> 01:38:44.268]  The government health department was taking women and sterilizing them.
[01:38:44.748 --> 01:38:46.249]  This is the authoritarianism.
[01:38:46.929 --> 01:38:51.673]  Same eugenics injected tens of thousands of blacks with syphilis for 45 years and covered it up.
[01:38:51.953 --> 01:38:54.114]  Oh, but let's just trust all these people now.
[01:38:55.255 --> 01:39:01.199]  Elevated rates of autism, other neurodevelopmental and psychiatric diagnosis and autistic traits in transgender and adult
[01:39:02.486 --> 01:39:03.567]  Diverse individuals.
[01:39:03.747 --> 01:39:06.009]  Nature.com, Journal of Nature.
[01:39:06.469 --> 01:39:08.051]  Six times more likely.
[01:39:08.491 --> 01:39:12.734]  Now, when we come back, I'm going to hit the ultra-massive news.
[01:39:13.035 --> 01:39:27.907]  I'm going to give you one example of one clinic, one ministry, again in Canada, the UK and Canada are the motherships of this, where one man has control of 500 plus children and they are now having three-year-olds transition.
[01:39:28.840 --> 01:39:31.142]  This is how you hide abuse in plain view.
[01:39:31.522 --> 01:39:32.363]  It is nightmarish.
[01:39:32.623 --> 01:39:33.924]  We'll cover it all on the other side.
[01:39:33.944 --> 01:39:39.409]  Then Greg Reese is going to be hosting with some huge news on what makes this whole satanic operation tick.
[01:39:39.689 --> 01:39:40.109]  Stay with us.
[01:39:40.189 --> 01:39:46.074]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, Band.Video, Tomorrow's News Today.
[01:39:46.334 --> 01:39:48.176]  Tell everybody you know, tune in right now.
[01:40:08.384 --> 01:40:12.519]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:40:13.638 --> 01:40:18.001]  Again, thank you for joining us on this live global transmission.
[01:40:18.542 --> 01:40:31.992]  The only way this information gets out to the general public is when you share it, when you tell people about those local radio stations, those local TV stations, when you support those stations, and when you tell them about Bandai Video and InfoWars.com and share the articles, the videos, the links on hundreds of important topics.
[01:40:32.012 --> 01:40:34.233]  Whatever you think is most important, please amplify it.
[01:40:34.273 --> 01:40:35.334]  We're all counting on you.
[01:40:35.514 --> 01:40:36.535]  We're all in this together again.
[01:40:36.775 --> 01:40:37.896]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:40:38.336 --> 01:40:41.378]  Gregg Reese is coming up with some key intel I'll tell you about in just a moment.
[01:40:43.226 --> 01:40:45.827]  Unix went on in lots of different cultures of the world.
[01:40:46.047 --> 01:40:46.588]  Egypt did it.
[01:40:47.048 --> 01:40:47.868]  Babylon did it.
[01:40:48.028 --> 01:40:48.929]  The Arabs did it.
[01:40:49.249 --> 01:40:50.129]  The Muslims do it.
[01:40:51.069 --> 01:40:55.151]  This is a big thing, where enslaved men are castrated as boys.
[01:40:55.811 --> 01:41:01.594]  They even had some of the European famous operas and famous choirs.
[01:41:02.594 --> 01:41:08.617]  The young boys at about age 11, they opt to be able to still sing high, to have their genitals removed.
[01:41:09.057 --> 01:41:10.498]  This is a real sick cult.
[01:41:11.564 --> 01:41:14.771]  That's been going along for a long, long time.
[01:41:14.791 --> 01:41:21.787]  This has been happening for thousands of years in many different cultures, but now it's been chosen as a way to depopulate.
[01:41:23.049 --> 01:41:29.755]  People that have already been damaged or who are brain damaged from the vaccines, from the pesticides, and a cocktail of other reasons.
[01:41:30.175 --> 01:41:32.377]  So now enter this individual.
[01:41:32.397 --> 01:41:34.199]  This is just one snapshot example.
[01:41:35.020 --> 01:41:41.325]  Gender therapy doctor admits to advising kids to fake being suicidal to get transgender treatments.
[01:41:41.926 --> 01:41:55.028]  And they're now saying because transgender are the highest level of HIV, of drug use, of suicide, it's the Christians' fault for not celebrating autistic children they've already captured, brainwashed, and then sexually mutilated.
[01:41:55.829 --> 01:41:58.649]  So it's not the people that did this to them and ruined their lives.
[01:41:58.709 --> 01:41:59.189]  No, no, no.
[01:41:59.629 --> 01:42:07.591]  It's those of us that tried to stop girls being given very dangerous chemicals to sterilize them, and little boys even being surgically sterilized by the millions.
[01:42:08.493 --> 01:42:10.275]  Gender Therapy Doctor.
[01:42:11.016 --> 01:42:15.841]  It's Dr. Wallace Wong is facing calls for an investigation into him.
[01:42:16.962 --> 01:42:26.913]  He has meetings at the Vancouver Public Library where he talks about how he does gender therapy practice that a few years ago only had a few pupils in his
[01:42:28.183 --> 01:42:40.771]  Outreach and it goes on to say that noting that his youngest client is not yet three years old and that he has 501 orphans and foster kids in his local practice.
[01:42:41.511 --> 01:42:42.812]  Remember what happened in the UK?
[01:42:43.252 --> 01:42:47.315]  They knew the Muslims were grooming tens of thousands of girls, selling them for sex as young as five.
[01:42:47.515 --> 01:42:48.075]  They covered it up.
[01:42:48.395 --> 01:42:49.616]  Remember what they did in Germany?
[01:42:50.176 --> 01:42:55.640]  Thousands of children over 30 years per city given to pedophiles who would then use them as
[01:42:56.400 --> 01:42:59.623]  Pedophile prostitutes to make money, and money paid back to the state.
[01:42:59.683 --> 01:43:00.563]  That's all confirmed.
[01:43:00.824 --> 01:43:01.724]  That's in plain view.
[01:43:02.045 --> 01:43:05.948]  And Google, Facebook, Twitter, censor this because at the top, most of them are pedophiles.
[01:43:06.228 --> 01:43:07.109]  This is a cult.
[01:43:07.369 --> 01:43:12.073]  You don't get into the club unless you vampirically destroy the future of children.
[01:43:12.913 --> 01:43:18.238]  So again, this individual only wants to remove their genitals or chemically castrate them.
[01:43:18.718 --> 01:43:20.099]  So it's one thing to rape children.
[01:43:20.139 --> 01:43:20.860]  That's bad enough.
[01:43:21.640 --> 01:43:24.343]  But imagine chemically having the
[01:43:25.478 --> 01:43:28.004]  Genitals removed or physically having them cut out.
[01:43:29.482 --> 01:43:35.704]  This is just absolutely sick, totally abusive in my view, and out of control, but it's all sold as empowering children.
[01:43:35.944 --> 01:43:40.986]  And look, just like Bill Gates, he's wearing a pink sweater, and he's so nice.
[01:43:41.006 --> 01:43:45.187]  He acts very effeminate, because he was a big man saying, I want your children's genitals.
[01:43:45.527 --> 01:43:46.787]  I want your children sterilized.
[01:43:47.007 --> 01:43:48.368]  People stand up and say, this is a creep.
[01:43:49.648 --> 01:43:54.370]  If a guy showed up in a park and talked to your daughter or son when they were five about their genitals, you'd get mad.
[01:43:54.410 --> 01:43:55.090]  You'd call the police.
[01:43:55.390 --> 01:43:57.150]  But now it's a psychologist.
[01:43:57.211 --> 01:43:57.951]  It's a doctor.
[01:43:59.071 --> 01:44:02.476]  Through the health department coming to help your children.
[01:44:02.516 --> 01:44:06.961]  The same health departments that sterilized millions of Native Americans in Canada and the U.S.
[01:44:07.402 --> 01:44:09.604]  and blacks and poor whites and others.
[01:44:09.925 --> 01:44:11.326]  It's the same system.
[01:44:11.687 --> 01:44:12.147]  Oh my...
[01:44:14.414 --> 01:44:15.614]  Post-surgery uncle.
[01:44:15.674 --> 01:44:18.615]  They learn all about getting HIV and having the red ribbons.
[01:44:18.675 --> 01:44:20.135]  Isn't it all just so sweet?
[01:44:20.355 --> 01:44:24.296]  When Kathy is Keith, how the girl becomes a boy.
[01:44:24.897 --> 01:44:26.457]  And of course, that's with chemicals.
[01:44:26.957 --> 01:44:28.157]  It isn't creepy or all.
[01:44:28.538 --> 01:44:29.698]  This guy isn't scary.
[01:44:30.258 --> 01:44:32.939]  So that's how this whole system works.
[01:44:34.901 --> 01:44:35.642]  What's more abusive?
[01:44:35.662 --> 01:44:37.184]  Children being delivered to be gang raped?
[01:44:37.525 --> 01:44:43.973]  Or children having their testicles actually cut off or chemically sterilized that causes cancer and all sorts of other health problems and stunts their growth?
[01:44:44.861 --> 01:44:46.182]  This is nightmarish.
[01:44:46.362 --> 01:44:51.406]  It's one thing if somebody doesn't have growth hormone, so you give a little boy or girl growth hormones so they can grow up to a normal height.
[01:44:51.826 --> 01:44:54.868]  Those are good hormone therapies that the parents opt into.
[01:44:55.489 --> 01:45:10.380]  But to have disadvantaged children captured by the state, taken out of good homes and bad homes, and then put into a system where he has 501 children that all get together and peer pressure each other to decide, I'm a boy when I was a girl.
[01:45:10.640 --> 01:45:11.921]  I'm a girl when I was a boy.
[01:45:12.501 --> 01:45:17.265]  This is abuse of the highest magnitude and this is the true evil taking place.
[01:45:17.305 --> 01:45:19.607]  So it's time to stand up to these bullies.
[01:45:20.208 --> 01:45:22.930]  It's time to say men shouldn't be able to take over women's sports.
[01:45:23.411 --> 01:45:28.495]  It's time to realize that appeasing this isn't being open and liberal and nice and progressive.
[01:45:29.256 --> 01:45:31.218]  It's progressive in a bad way like cancer.
[01:45:32.099 --> 01:45:41.485]  Spreading through a body, and it's got the biggest corporations, the biggest banks, and the biggest authoritarian systems backing it, because it's a depopulation, destruction of the family takeover program.
[01:45:41.745 --> 01:45:42.326]  They admit...
[01:45:43.223 --> 01:45:46.024]  That is meant to bring down the world's population.
[01:45:46.044 --> 01:45:52.447]  And to do that, you've got to annihilate families, you've got to annihilate family groups, community groups that can stand up and defend each other.
[01:45:52.867 --> 01:45:55.869]  This is a corporate takeover of the very biology of humans.
[01:45:56.329 --> 01:46:04.212]  By 2047, the UN even estimates that there will be almost no men that have sperm anymore that will get a woman pregnant that will fertilize an egg.
[01:46:04.712 --> 01:46:05.153]  We're here.
[01:46:05.833 --> 01:46:10.215]  So now all babies will have to be designer and will be a splice they make in a lab.
[01:46:11.465 --> 01:46:18.412]  The future is here and it's a nightmare and we need to say no and stop letting the Bill Gates's, the Klaus Schwab's, and the Communist Chinese of the world run it.
[01:46:19.212 --> 01:46:29.742]  Now coming up, Gregory did a great job with his Illuminati Unmasked, Illuminati Unveiled report and then that brought a lot of folks out of the woodwork saying, oh my gosh,
[01:46:30.983 --> 01:46:35.328]  Alex Jones' Occupower pills, that I think we don't even have anymore, have an eye on them.
[01:46:35.368 --> 01:46:36.429]  That means Illuminati.
[01:46:37.350 --> 01:46:38.872]  No, that means it's for your eyes.
[01:46:39.272 --> 01:46:41.515]  Or look, the silver bullet looks like a male genital.
[01:46:41.775 --> 01:46:42.596]  No, that's a bullet.
[01:46:43.236 --> 01:46:48.782]  So just because the Illuminati uses symbols like the sun rising, or the tree of life, or things like that,
[01:46:49.443 --> 01:46:52.246]  Just because we use symbols doesn't mean we're with the Illuminati.
[01:46:52.626 --> 01:46:56.049]  Jesus says, judge a tree by its fruits.
[01:46:56.289 --> 01:46:57.350]  I snuck into Bohemian Grove.
[01:46:57.731 --> 01:46:58.832]  I've exposed skull and bones.
[01:46:59.172 --> 01:47:03.816]  I love Jesus Christ, but I'm not a Pharisee telling you everybody's going to hell but me.
[01:47:04.337 --> 01:47:13.565]  And so, in a part two we're going to explain how George Washington could be good, but how Masonry could be pretty bad now, because the darker forces of the Illuminati took it over.
[01:47:14.286 --> 01:47:17.388]  Freemasonry predates Christianity, even Judaism.
[01:47:17.628 --> 01:47:20.431]  It was a college of all thought and all systems.
[01:47:20.911 --> 01:47:23.012]  Alchemy, occultism, you name it.
[01:47:23.393 --> 01:47:25.134]  And so, that's really what Masonry is.
[01:47:25.454 --> 01:47:27.075]  Has it been taken over by the modern Illuminati?
[01:47:27.115 --> 01:47:27.396]  Yes.
[01:47:28.136 --> 01:47:29.157]  Is there another Illuminati?
[01:47:29.437 --> 01:47:31.098]  Anybody that loves God is illuminated.
[01:47:31.499 --> 01:47:33.300]  And it's not a secret organization.
[01:47:33.580 --> 01:47:34.601]  It's a relationship with God.
[01:47:34.821 --> 01:47:36.903]  With Satan, everything is an inversion.
[01:47:37.663 --> 01:47:38.884]  Everything is the opposite.
[01:47:39.164 --> 01:47:44.347]  Everything is upside down, and then Satan claims credit for everything God's done.
[01:47:44.407 --> 01:47:45.167]  Like, take this.
[01:47:46.088 --> 01:47:46.928]  God gave us life.
[01:47:47.008 --> 01:47:49.790]  God gave us women, and gave women men.
[01:47:49.950 --> 01:47:55.393]  And the enjoyment of sex, and food, and life, and sunshine, and beauty, that came from God.
[01:47:55.873 --> 01:47:58.935]  The average Satanist advertises that sex and fun comes from them.
[01:47:59.235 --> 01:48:05.139]  No, God gave it to us in the place of marriage, to be strong, and to enjoy each other, and to have communion.
[01:48:05.879 --> 01:48:06.679]  That's what this is all about.
[01:48:06.739 --> 01:48:08.800]  So, oh, Alex Jones has sex.
[01:48:08.820 --> 01:48:09.521]  He's a Satanist.
[01:48:09.581 --> 01:48:09.801]  What?
[01:48:10.361 --> 01:48:12.902]  Or Alex Jones has videos with the sun rising over the earth.
[01:48:13.202 --> 01:48:14.082]  Oh, that's Satanism.
[01:48:14.323 --> 01:48:16.043]  No, that's a symbol of beauty and a new day.
[01:48:16.804 --> 01:48:19.145]  And Christ has risen, not Lucifer.
[01:48:19.465 --> 01:48:21.185]  So they invert everything we do.
[01:48:21.225 --> 01:48:22.706]  We flip it back straight up.
[01:48:23.066 --> 01:48:25.147]  Greg Reese is coming up to talk about that in the next segment.
[01:48:25.187 --> 01:48:28.288]  We'll air his amazing report going viral at Man.Video.
[01:48:28.529 --> 01:48:31.050]  And then we've got a big guest host in the fourth hour.
[01:48:31.310 --> 01:48:31.930]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:48:31.970 --> 01:48:32.890]  This is the InfoWar.
[01:48:33.110 --> 01:48:34.131]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:48:40.987 --> 01:48:43.129]  You are watching the Alex Jones Show.
[01:48:43.149 --> 01:48:46.671]  I'm your guest host for this segment, Greg Reese.
[01:48:48.572 --> 01:49:00.381]  As a response to a lot of interesting comments we got in controversies, including comments about the skull and the dagger, I was asked this morning to come on and talk, and it's a great honor.
[01:49:00.781 --> 01:49:02.502]  It's a subject that I'm very excited to talk about.
[01:49:04.423 --> 01:49:05.084]  Very rarely
[01:49:06.659 --> 01:49:08.361]  Um, am I asked to do anything?
[01:49:08.501 --> 01:49:10.002]  That's one of the best things about my job here.
[01:49:10.022 --> 01:49:12.244]  I started working here this July.
[01:49:12.344 --> 01:49:13.465]  It'll be three years.
[01:49:14.886 --> 01:49:22.832]  And I was very surprised when I showed up that basically I was, I was set up with a computer and the basic instructions I was given by Rob Due was, uh,
[01:49:25.728 --> 01:49:27.490]  Pick a subject, make a report, upload it.
[01:49:28.391 --> 01:49:33.858]  I had the blessing of uploading to our YouTube channel once before we were shut off a week after I got the job.
[01:49:34.559 --> 01:49:35.821]  And that's been my job ever since.
[01:49:36.021 --> 01:49:40.747]  I've never had a job quite like this where I had the freedom to do and say what I want to say.
[01:49:40.767 --> 01:49:43.491]  I think in the three years, almost three years I've been here,
[01:49:44.653 --> 01:49:51.655]  There was definitely once that I was given direction on the history of Bill Gates and eugenics.
[01:49:51.715 --> 01:49:52.715]  I can't remember the exact title.
[01:49:53.795 --> 01:49:56.116]  That was given to me by Jones.
[01:49:56.736 --> 01:50:01.197]  He just came in and kind of rattled off a bunch of notes and then I researched it all and put that together.
[01:50:02.437 --> 01:50:06.058]  And I believe there's a couple other times where he handed me something casually and
[01:50:07.233 --> 01:50:07.533]  What not.
[01:50:07.553 --> 01:50:09.594]  But other than that, I get to do what I want.
[01:50:10.055 --> 01:50:18.239]  And so, it was a great honor that he called me this morning and said, you know, we're getting all these comments, there's a lot of controversy, this is a great time to have a conversation about this, so why don't you come on and talk about it.
[01:50:18.940 --> 01:50:19.880]  So here I am.
[01:50:19.920 --> 01:50:20.500]  I got some notes.
[01:50:21.721 --> 01:50:24.403]  This is something I could talk about forever, so I'm going to try to keep it quick.
[01:50:24.583 --> 01:50:27.584]  I have quite a bit of experience in this, I would say.
[01:50:28.145 --> 01:50:29.786]  Technically, I think you could say I'm an expert on
[01:50:30.766 --> 01:50:34.131]  Religion, the occult, and all religious traditions.
[01:50:34.191 --> 01:50:36.393]  It's something I've been fascinated with my whole life.
[01:50:36.433 --> 01:50:41.019]  Before I came here, I spent about close to 15 years traveling around.
[01:50:41.039 --> 01:50:45.084]  I was living in monasteries and ashrams and studying all kinds of things.
[01:50:46.167 --> 01:50:48.770]  I was born and raised Christian.
[01:50:48.810 --> 01:50:54.676]  I have a very close and personal relationship and it's something I consider to be very private.
[01:50:54.716 --> 01:50:56.378]  That's something we're going to get into in this conversation.
[01:50:56.658 --> 01:50:57.859]  So, here we go.
[01:50:58.881 --> 01:51:02.945]  I knew when I made this report that it was going to get very controversial.
[01:51:03.065 --> 01:51:06.028]  This report was simply based on a five-hour
[01:51:06.969 --> 01:51:09.531]  Confession of the Australian pop singer.
[01:51:10.132 --> 01:51:17.078]  And the whole time I was doing it I was thinking if I was actually doing a report on the Freemasons and the Illuminati it would be a bit different than this.
[01:51:17.118 --> 01:51:18.279]  There would be other things mentioned.
[01:51:18.939 --> 01:51:24.324]  A lot of the things in the comments that people are mentioning are things that I absolutely would have put in the report and we are going to do a second report on that.
[01:51:24.424 --> 01:51:25.365]  That will be our report.
[01:51:26.308 --> 01:51:32.270]  This was a report on a file, this was a boil down to save you five hours to watch what this guy was saying in ten minutes, which I find to be fascinating.
[01:51:32.490 --> 01:51:34.431]  I've always found this information to be very fascinating.
[01:51:35.111 --> 01:51:43.394]  And you're a bit foolish if you think that the satanic Luciferian agenda does not have an extremely organized structure.
[01:51:44.335 --> 01:51:45.255]  It's well hidden.
[01:51:46.336 --> 01:51:47.596]  I certainly don't know all the answers.
[01:51:48.536 --> 01:51:49.437]  I hardly know anything.
[01:51:50.496 --> 01:51:58.322]  The one thing I do know, and this was the most true comment that I read on the comment stream of the video, is that it's all about the struggle of good versus evil.
[01:51:58.422 --> 01:52:07.149]  That's about the limit of my knowledge, is that it's all a struggle of good versus evil, and I believe, my faith tells me, that everything is God.
[01:52:08.270 --> 01:52:11.312]  Everything in this world is God.
[01:52:12.053 --> 01:52:13.734]  And so, therefore, evil
[01:52:15.327 --> 01:52:16.068]  is a part of God.
[01:52:16.848 --> 01:52:21.231]  Everyone, a lot of atheists will say, if God's real, why does God let bad things happen?
[01:52:21.251 --> 01:52:22.152]  Well, the answer is easy.
[01:52:22.572 --> 01:52:26.775]  Because we're not here to live in the Garden of Eden, we're here to grow and learn from our experiences.
[01:52:26.795 --> 01:52:28.656]  We're here to learn.
[01:52:28.696 --> 01:52:32.479]  And how is the best way to learn is by experiencing suffering, bad things happening.
[01:52:32.839 --> 01:52:33.479]  And then what do we do?
[01:52:33.539 --> 01:52:41.725]  You can either play the victim, which we know all about these days, or you can look within, you can humble yourself and go to God and illuminate yourself.
[01:52:46.087 --> 01:52:47.768]  You know, I was born curious.
[01:52:47.828 --> 01:52:48.788]  I was born faithful.
[01:52:48.828 --> 01:52:50.508]  I'm very, very grateful for that.
[01:52:51.309 --> 01:52:53.589]  I never was much of a churchgoer.
[01:52:53.870 --> 01:52:57.071]  I was raised in a Catholic Church and there was quite a bit of pedo-priests where I went.
[01:52:57.151 --> 01:53:01.432]  And at a very young age, I became very distrustful of organized religion.
[01:53:02.192 --> 01:53:03.793]  I found my relationship within.
[01:53:03.893 --> 01:53:08.114]  And now, this is a rant, so we would love to have a discussion.
[01:53:08.134 --> 01:53:12.396]  I would love to have a discussion with anyone, but I'm going to be ranting here for only five minutes, so I better get through this.
[01:53:16.505 --> 01:53:20.068]  When I was a child, I remember seeing the all-seeing eye.
[01:53:20.108 --> 01:53:20.928]  It's on the dollar bill.
[01:53:21.208 --> 01:53:22.049]  You grow up seeing it.
[01:53:23.030 --> 01:53:27.152]  And symbols aren't owned by anyone.
[01:53:27.193 --> 01:53:32.236]  A symbol is, you interpret a symbol based on your filter, on your psychological filter.
[01:53:33.057 --> 01:53:35.879]  So when I first saw that, clearly I thought of God.
[01:53:35.939 --> 01:53:36.979]  It's at the top of the pyramid.
[01:53:37.019 --> 01:53:37.600]  It's above all.
[01:53:37.660 --> 01:53:38.701]  It's looking down on us all.
[01:53:39.541 --> 01:53:40.262]  It seemed deeply
[01:53:41.420 --> 01:53:41.980]  Spiritual to me.
[01:53:42.020 --> 01:53:45.482]  So when I would look at that symbol, I would see God.
[01:53:45.502 --> 01:53:46.563]  I would see goodness in that.
[01:53:47.043 --> 01:53:59.929]  Later on in life, as I got older, and I started watching the Freemason Conspiracy videos and the Illuminati videos, I was told that that symbol is evil, and that that symbol represents Satan.
[01:54:01.390 --> 01:54:05.992]  And there was a time when then, when I would look at that symbol, then that's how I perceived it.
[01:54:06.893 --> 01:54:09.554]  I then perceived it as if I'm looking at something evil.
[01:54:10.215 --> 01:54:10.915]  Now think about that.
[01:54:12.247 --> 01:54:15.690]  This is really the only power that they have is playing with our minds.
[01:54:16.791 --> 01:54:30.603]  The great writer, in my opinion, Robert Anton Wilson, another controversial subject, definitely an occultist, writer of Prometheus Rising and the Cosmic Trigger, two great books, he is very illuminating when he teaches you about the mind.
[01:54:30.663 --> 01:54:33.386]  One of his things that he talks about all the time is the
[01:54:35.054 --> 01:54:36.915]  What the thinker thinks, the prover proves.
[01:54:37.696 --> 01:54:39.638]  And he goes on to have different experiments you can do.
[01:54:39.658 --> 01:54:46.183]  And basically what it shows you is if anyone has belief in something, then you know that you see it in this world.
[01:54:46.923 --> 01:54:48.765]  And we often interpret that as evidence.
[01:54:48.825 --> 01:54:57.831]  If we believe something and then we see, you know, if we believe that we're going to see a quarter, this is maybe a silly example, we believe we're going to find a quarter and we find it, then we might
[01:55:00.533 --> 01:55:02.873]  Well, that means that God's speaking to me, and that means I'm right.
[01:55:02.893 --> 01:55:05.414]  That's an answer to my... But that's not the case.
[01:55:05.814 --> 01:55:10.736]  And there are excellent examples in his book where he gives you practices.
[01:55:10.836 --> 01:55:11.956]  You can practice this in your own life.
[01:55:11.976 --> 01:55:18.938]  You can practice changing your own belief system and notice that you will then start seeing things as if the universe or God is telling you, yeah, you're right.
[01:55:19.299 --> 01:55:23.180]  No, that's just the way the mind works, and they know that, so they can take these symbols and invert them.
[01:55:23.720 --> 01:55:29.062]  They can take all that is good and make it bad, and that is exactly the goal, and we all kind of know this.
[01:55:30.682 --> 01:55:32.023]  I mean, we're all kind of waking up.
[01:55:33.623 --> 01:55:35.584]  That means we're all becoming illuminated.
[01:55:36.804 --> 01:55:39.165]  That's just a word that's describing that.
[01:55:39.525 --> 01:55:41.346]  There is no evil in a word.
[01:55:42.577 --> 01:55:51.243]  That's another thing Robert Anton Wilson kind of joked about, is he said, maybe the Illuminati is just simply made up of all of us once we become aware of these truths.
[01:55:51.303 --> 01:55:53.325]  And these truths, these are of God.
[01:55:53.865 --> 01:55:55.586]  Everything in the world is of God.
[01:55:55.606 --> 01:55:58.689]  That's my belief, but I find it impossible for you to tell me otherwise.
[01:56:00.250 --> 01:56:04.012]  And so therefore, we see in the symbols what we want to see.
[01:56:04.032 --> 01:56:06.534]  We're seeing it through our own filter.
[01:56:09.757 --> 01:56:11.378]  And what's the beauty of this connection?
[01:56:13.154 --> 01:56:14.716]  Why form this personal connection?
[01:56:14.756 --> 01:56:23.826]  Well, another thing I learned in my journeys, this is taught in the Yoga Sutras, which is another great scripture, is how do you know things?
[01:56:23.886 --> 01:56:24.787]  How do you know the truth?
[01:56:25.027 --> 01:56:26.168]  They call it right knowledge.
[01:56:27.270 --> 01:56:29.912]  And there's three ways, according to the Yoga Sutras, to get right knowledge.
[01:56:29.952 --> 01:56:32.815]  There is direct experience, inference, and verbal testimony.
[01:56:33.595 --> 01:56:39.140]  Direct experience is the best, and this is when you experience it for yourself, when you see it with your own two eyes, when you know it.
[01:56:39.921 --> 01:56:41.582]  Inference is when you're using logic.
[01:56:41.763 --> 01:56:46.967]  You're taking what you've seen already, and then you're applying logic, and you're inferring, well, maybe this is what's happening.
[01:56:47.507 --> 01:56:51.151]  And verbal testimony is the worst of the three, and that's when you're just hearing it from someone else.
[01:56:51.831 --> 01:56:52.592]  So what does this tell you?
[01:56:52.912 --> 01:56:54.453]  This tells you that you want
[01:56:55.305 --> 01:56:56.766]  To experience the truth for yourself.
[01:56:56.806 --> 01:56:59.168]  That's the direct experience.
[01:56:59.929 --> 01:57:01.910]  So the direct experience of God, how do you achieve that?
[01:57:01.950 --> 01:57:03.231]  I don't believe you achieve it in a church.
[01:57:03.251 --> 01:57:05.013]  I don't believe you achieve it through a third party.
[01:57:05.053 --> 01:57:11.037]  I believe you achieve it going within and asking, humbling yourself.
[01:57:12.218 --> 01:57:13.819]  And it's very private.
[01:57:13.939 --> 01:57:15.641]  It's something I really never talk about.
[01:57:15.661 --> 01:57:19.083]  At least on air like this or something like that.
[01:57:19.144 --> 01:57:21.866]  Although it's the most important part of my life.
[01:57:22.901 --> 01:57:25.763]  It saved me through my calamity, through my suffering.
[01:57:26.283 --> 01:57:27.324]  It's the only thing that saved me.
[01:57:28.705 --> 01:57:35.189]  And what we're seeing today with all the inversion of everything is it's simply
[01:57:37.236 --> 01:57:38.577]  Creating fear and confusion.
[01:57:39.337 --> 01:57:40.417]  There's no reason to be afraid.
[01:57:40.877 --> 01:57:42.638]  The only power these people have is doing that.
[01:57:42.658 --> 01:57:43.599]  They are these psyops.
[01:57:44.339 --> 01:57:49.841]  You know, in the beauty of illumination, Alex gave a really good example when I was talking to him this morning.
[01:57:49.961 --> 01:57:55.583]  He's like, when you throw a dart, if you don't think what you're doing, if you just go with your gut, go with your intuition, you'll hit a bullseye.
[01:57:56.104 --> 01:57:57.704]  And that's the same thing with the work that I do.
[01:57:57.764 --> 01:58:00.625]  I feel when I do something great, a happy accident, that is God.
[01:58:01.006 --> 01:58:02.066]  That's the grace of God.
[01:58:03.006 --> 01:58:05.387]  And that's something we can all seek without fear.
[01:58:05.888 --> 01:58:06.648]  We'll see you after the break.
[01:58:07.978 --> 01:58:08.798]  Welcome back!
[01:58:09.618 --> 01:58:11.319]  You are watching the Alex Jones Show!
[01:58:12.059 --> 01:58:13.039]  Thank you for your support.
[01:58:13.539 --> 01:58:15.779]  Please continue supporting us at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:58:15.799 --> 01:58:17.620]  Right now we have 50% off TurboForce.
[01:58:18.220 --> 01:58:20.920]  I'm going to try to spit out my final thought here and then we're going to go to the video.
[01:58:21.800 --> 01:58:25.841]  So, speaking of good and evil, there's good and evil in everything.
[01:58:26.601 --> 01:58:26.981]  In man.
[01:58:28.102 --> 01:58:29.282]  In our hearts, there's good and evil.
[01:58:29.322 --> 01:58:31.542]  That's the bottom line here.
[01:58:32.302 --> 01:58:36.023]  By inverting everything, they create fear and confusion.
[01:58:37.554 --> 01:58:43.219]  So, what's the best tool that we have to fight through this, other than forming a personal relationship with God?
[01:58:43.880 --> 01:58:53.409]  Well, if you're not getting clear intuition, there is a Bible passage that teaches us, "...beware of false prophets who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves.
[01:58:53.469 --> 01:58:54.990]  You will know them by their fruits."
[01:58:56.071 --> 01:58:59.034]  So, you can look at what a person produces.
[01:59:00.509 --> 01:59:02.830]  And you can see where their heart is.
[01:59:03.311 --> 01:59:06.492]  Obviously, we never said that all Freemasons are evil.
[01:59:07.033 --> 01:59:08.634]  If you watch the video, you'll see.
[01:59:08.654 --> 01:59:12.576]  And like I said, we were basically repeating what this gentleman said.
[01:59:12.756 --> 01:59:14.277]  And everything he says, we all heard before.
[01:59:18.410 --> 01:59:19.190]  I think that's about it.
[01:59:19.250 --> 01:59:20.731]  Like I said, I could go on and on and on.
[01:59:21.811 --> 01:59:23.272]  It's a very interesting subject to me.
[01:59:23.312 --> 01:59:25.632]  I think it's probably one of the most important subjects we're facing.
[01:59:25.672 --> 01:59:26.793]  We are going to do a video on it.
[01:59:27.073 --> 01:59:28.213]  We love the conversation.
[01:59:28.593 --> 01:59:29.513]  Thank you for watching.
[01:59:29.554 --> 01:59:30.094]  Support us.
[01:59:30.294 --> 01:59:34.315]  And now, here is the controversial video the Illuminati unveiled.
[01:59:35.395 --> 01:59:39.577]  Lucifer, son of the morning, is it he who bears the light?
[01:59:40.417 --> 01:59:41.097]  Doubt it not.
[01:59:42.578 --> 01:59:44.638]  That's the beginning of their big secret.
[01:59:45.899 --> 01:59:46.819]  God is the devil.
[01:59:47.737 --> 01:59:49.779]  And we're already in hell right now.
[01:59:53.804 --> 02:00:03.094]  Alteon Jurek, best known as Alteon Childs, is an Australian performer who topped the charts after winning the second season of X Factor Australia in 2010.
[02:00:05.043 --> 02:00:16.246]  On April 15th of this year, Altion published a five-hour video claiming he was initiated into the Freemasons and that Freemasonry is hiding the true world religion, Satanism.
[02:00:17.246 --> 02:00:30.790]  He goes on to reveal how every initiate must swear a vow of secrecy to never reveal the secrets of Freemasonry to anyone whatsoever under penalty of having their body severed in two and their bowels burned to ashes.
[02:00:31.630 --> 02:00:34.731]  Their throat slit and their tongue torn out by the roots.
[02:00:35.371 --> 02:00:39.932]  This is the sign you do upon entering and exiting the ritual room while facing the Grand Master.
[02:00:40.212 --> 02:00:43.052]  It stands for throat slit and it goes like this.
[02:00:44.713 --> 02:00:55.175]  They use symbolic gestures to flaunt their secret religion, such as the sign of the Master of the Second Veil or the Hidden Hand, the sign of silence.
[02:00:57.188 --> 02:01:02.995]  As you move up the ranks of Freemasonry, the oaths of silence for taking each degree become more brutal.
[02:01:03.776 --> 02:01:16.332]  Having your heart torn out and fed to wild beasts, your head struck off and placed on the highest spire of Christendom, destroying your business and reputation, and hanging you in your own home.
[02:01:17.751 --> 02:01:26.575]  Masonic rules clearly stipulate that the Lodge has the authority and obligation to uphold these mandates and penalize any member who violates them.
[02:01:27.395 --> 02:01:31.337]  Masonic rules also warn members from inviting the vulgar and profane.
[02:01:31.357 --> 02:01:37.740]  The profane is what they call the uninitiated, anyone outside their secret order.
[02:01:38.920 --> 02:01:45.646]  As one climbs the ladder of power in Freemasonry, each degree requires more barbaric acts from the Initiate.
[02:01:46.406 --> 02:01:52.731]  From being humiliated and stepped on, drinking wine from a human skull, stabbing human skulls.
[02:01:53.532 --> 02:02:01.599]  And in one of the highest degrees, the Initiate removes a blindfold to find a severed human head lying on the floor with a bloody knife beside it.
[02:02:01.959 --> 02:02:05.402]  He is instructed to take the knife in his right hand and the head in his left.
[02:02:06.920 --> 02:02:15.391]  Eventually, this leads the initiate to accept human sacrifice as a right of initiation, which is the ultimate goal of this unholy hierarchy.
[02:02:18.180 --> 02:02:30.914]  33rd degree Mason Manley P. Hall, who was named Freemason of the Century, wrote that Freemasonry is a religion and that initiates are intentionally misled until they reach the highest levels.
[02:02:31.535 --> 02:02:37.001]  He wrote that Freemasonry is an outer organization concealing an inner brotherhood.
[02:02:38.002 --> 02:02:40.044]  One visible and one invisible.
[02:02:40.464 --> 02:02:45.609]  The invisible is dedicated to the service of a mysterious Arcanum Arcanorum.
[02:02:46.390 --> 02:02:50.173]  Having a belief in a Supreme Being is required to become a Mason.
[02:02:51.014 --> 02:02:56.479]  And the atheist is looked upon by the Mason as being the most vulgar and despicable of mankind.
[02:02:57.099 --> 02:02:59.601]  But who is the Supreme Being in Masonry?
[02:03:00.302 --> 02:03:03.705]  Freemasonry is Satanism in disguise.
[02:03:04.737 --> 02:03:13.161]  33rd Degree Sovereign Grand Commander of the Scottish Rite, Albert Pike, wrote in Morals and Dogma that Lucifer is the light bearer.
[02:03:14.241 --> 02:03:21.104]  33rd Degree Mason, Albert Mackey, wrote that Lucifer is good, light, victory, and initiation.
[02:03:22.384 --> 02:03:33.009]  And 33rd Degree Freemason of the Century, Manly P. Hall, wrote that the mystery of the craft is the seething, surging energies of Lucifer that can be wielded by the initiate.
[02:03:34.149 --> 02:03:41.175]  This is the symbol for Satanism, and this is the symbol for female Freemasonry, the Order of the Eastern Star.
[02:03:42.476 --> 02:03:50.462]  The Satanic Bible lists Baphomet as the symbol of Satan worshipped by the highest level of Freemasonry, the Templar Masons.
[02:03:51.636 --> 02:04:05.543]  In the Satanic Rituals, it is written that Masonic Orders contain the most influential men in government, and virtually every occult order has Masonic roots, and that every rite of the Nazi's Black Order employed Masonic principles.
[02:04:07.224 --> 02:04:12.546]  Both Satanism and Masonic Rituals involve the goat, the coffin, and the death's head.
[02:04:13.967 --> 02:04:19.890]  Anton LaVey wrote that the Masonic Rituals serve as a screening process for organized Satanism.
[02:04:21.377 --> 02:04:25.247]  Freemasons can also be seen making the 666 hand gesture.
[02:04:30.593 --> 02:04:31.434]  I'm a Christian, sir.
[02:04:32.054 --> 02:04:34.496]  I'm pure and virtuous and wholesome and innocent.
[02:04:34.937 --> 02:04:37.059]  How can you say anything about it about me?
[02:04:37.399 --> 02:04:38.640]  Sir, you need to be born again.
[02:04:39.320 --> 02:04:40.181]  I am born again!
[02:04:40.321 --> 02:04:41.943]  Now, did you just say that you're Lucifer?
[02:04:42.423 --> 02:04:43.023]  I am Lucifer.
[02:04:43.043 --> 02:04:44.445]  Okay, define Lucifer for me.
[02:04:44.885 --> 02:04:49.389]  Pure, virtuous, wholesome, innocent individual that's out to help people.
[02:04:49.649 --> 02:04:50.390]  Lucifer is?
[02:04:50.630 --> 02:04:51.330]  Yeah.
[02:04:51.470 --> 02:04:52.031]  Say that again.
[02:04:52.111 --> 02:04:55.233]  Lucifer is a pure, holy... Virtuous!
[02:04:55.414 --> 02:04:56.154]  Virtuous.
[02:04:56.374 --> 02:04:58.056]  Now, is he the Lucifer that God created?
[02:04:58.476 --> 02:04:59.197]  That's the same one.
[02:04:59.657 --> 02:05:16.233]  At the highest level of the so-called Illuminati is a perverted sex cult, which is why high-level Mason Walt Disney not only saturated his films with masonic hand gestures and 666, but also added subliminal images with hidden sexuality.
[02:05:18.416 --> 02:05:22.561]  Alteon claims that the square and compass are actually symbolizing the sex act.
[02:05:23.242 --> 02:05:26.346]  The woman's legs spread open and a man mounting her.
[02:05:27.168 --> 02:05:30.652]  The G symbolizes the generative principle of creation.
[02:05:31.574 --> 02:05:34.297]  The all-seeing eye symbolizes the head of the penis.
[02:05:35.623 --> 02:05:38.005]  And the rays shooting forth, the orgasm.
[02:05:39.386 --> 02:05:44.710]  Each year, 13 high-level masons may be invited to join the top of this monstrous pyramid.
[02:05:45.410 --> 02:05:46.932]  The Royal Order of Jesters.
[02:05:48.112 --> 02:05:50.855]  Dedicated to nothing but sexual depravity.
[02:05:51.155 --> 02:05:51.995]  There is no sin.
[02:05:52.936 --> 02:05:53.797]  There is only nature.
[02:05:54.978 --> 02:05:58.500]  Why do you think that witchcraft has disappeared?
[02:05:58.520 --> 02:06:01.663]  It never disappeared.
[02:06:02.763 --> 02:06:03.264]  It was hidden.
[02:06:04.498 --> 02:06:08.599]  Forced to go into hiding by the appearance of Jesus on the human scene.
[02:06:09.739 --> 02:06:12.600]  Another reason why he's passionately hated.
[02:06:12.740 --> 02:06:17.401]  33rd degree mason Alistair Crowley wrote how he pecks at the eyes of Jesus on the cross.
[02:06:18.082 --> 02:06:26.884]  How the new age will arise from the destruction of Christianity and how all children shall be accustomed from infancy to witness every type of sexual act.
[02:06:28.453 --> 02:06:33.696]  According to the royal art of Freemasonry, magic is the highest and most divine.
[02:06:34.397 --> 02:06:35.578]  And what is this magic?
[02:06:35.818 --> 02:06:41.261]  Any living being is a storehouse of energy, varying in quantity according to the size and health of the animal.
[02:06:42.222 --> 02:06:45.144]  At the death of the animal, this energy is liberated suddenly.
[02:06:45.844 --> 02:06:48.246]  The animal therefore should be killed within the circle.
[02:06:48.786 --> 02:06:55.771]  For the highest spiritual working, one must accordingly choose that victim which contains the greatest and purest force.
[02:06:56.951 --> 02:06:57.772]  A male child.
[02:06:58.607 --> 02:07:05.790]  We are witnessing the culmination of their mysterious Arcanum, the destruction of Christianity and the mass sacrifice of humanity.
[02:07:06.810 --> 02:07:19.376]  Created in 1979 by the Masonic Order of the Rose Cross, the first Luciferian commandment carved into the Georgia Guidestones is to maintain humanity under 500 million in perpetual balance with nature.
[02:07:20.794 --> 02:07:29.037]  High-level Mason Friedrich Nietzsche wrote how Christianity is more harmful than any vice and considered Christians sick animals.
[02:07:30.597 --> 02:07:42.661]  Their utopian New Age, as written about in the Satanic Bible and in the Lucius Trust, consultants to the European Union, is nothing more than the absolute destruction of Christianity.
[02:07:44.081 --> 02:07:50.303]  Aleister Crowley wrote how the people need to be ruled by the state and the world must be bathed in blood to usher in the New Age.
[02:07:51.940 --> 02:07:57.785]  Subversion of all governments and world religions has been going on in secrecy for centuries.
[02:07:59.046 --> 02:08:09.135]  Religious leaders, heads of state, and your favorite pop stars have practically all been absorbed into this hidden hand of Satanism.
[02:08:09.236 --> 02:08:12.098]  In 1991, the Noahide laws were signed into U.S.
[02:08:12.178 --> 02:08:15.101]  law by Skull and Bones member George Bush.
[02:08:17.748 --> 02:08:25.792]  Once these laws are practiced openly, it will be blasphemy to call Jesus Christ your Lord and Savior, punishable by death.
[02:08:26.752 --> 02:08:29.734]  They want to bring us back to the days of blood sacrifice.
[02:08:30.914 --> 02:08:37.117]  Whether you believe or not, the culture of compassion, mercy and love is Christian.
[02:08:38.598 --> 02:08:40.879]  Christ ended the days of blood sacrifice.
[02:08:41.699 --> 02:08:43.900]  Christ forgave us of our sins.
[02:08:44.320 --> 02:08:45.241]  Well, here I am again.
[02:08:46.952 --> 02:08:58.434]  Every time that you see me on the Alex Jones Show, it's a good sign, I guess, because we never know when we're going to be removed from communicating.
[02:08:59.194 --> 02:09:03.255]  That's going to be one of the real turning points in our country.
[02:09:04.415 --> 02:09:09.376]  While we can communicate, I would say we're still free, right?
[02:09:10.016 --> 02:09:10.897]  We're still free.
[02:09:12.577 --> 02:09:12.897]  Although,
[02:09:13.598 --> 02:09:18.799]  Pretty soon, we're going to all be faced with the pressure to take this vaccine.
[02:09:19.959 --> 02:09:24.280]  And at that point, I would say we most absolutely certainly are not free.
[02:09:25.461 --> 02:09:39.624]  And already, a lot of us, I think, are not free just to the extent that this full court press of brainwashing has succeeded in stealing their human agency.
[02:09:42.035 --> 02:09:42.675]  I'm a boomer.
[02:09:42.915 --> 02:10:00.340]  You know, I was born at the end of the 50s, and I've seen a lot, but I have never seen anything in my life like the total wall-to-wall, 24-7 brainwashing to take this vaccine.
[02:10:01.461 --> 02:10:10.383]  This untested, emergency use authorized only, experimental mRNA gene therapy,
[02:10:11.115 --> 02:10:13.196]  We literally are the human guinea pigs.
[02:10:15.196 --> 02:10:21.878]  We don't know how much research went into this before Operation Warp Speed.
[02:10:22.958 --> 02:10:38.702]  Did these big pharma companies that are one way or the other under the control of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the George Soros Open Society, these huge global monopolies,
[02:10:40.017 --> 02:10:43.280]  Have they been just waiting to roll this out?
[02:10:43.701 --> 02:10:55.913]  Waiting for a reason to inject, no pun intended, their own agenda into this pandemic?
[02:10:56.834 --> 02:11:02.019]  You know, I'm an admirer of Donald Trump, as many of us are.
[02:11:02.039 --> 02:11:04.001]  He at least was a fighter.
[02:11:04.778 --> 02:11:16.023]  But I think that when it comes to Operation Warp Speed and rolling out the vaccine, I think that he was also brainwashed and rolled.
[02:11:17.103 --> 02:11:23.826]  He was put into a position where he couldn't say no to this vaccine program.
[02:11:24.947 --> 02:11:32.590]  And as a result, we have what we have, which is potentially as bad as
[02:11:33.183 --> 02:11:35.385]  Even a mass sterilization event?
[02:11:36.705 --> 02:11:37.706]  We really don't know.
[02:11:39.728 --> 02:11:41.129]  How can we, how can we tell?
[02:11:42.590 --> 02:11:46.852]  Right now I can't even tell if I'm, if my Skype connection is working.
[02:11:49.094 --> 02:11:50.675]  Have I lost the connection folks?
[02:11:52.416 --> 02:11:56.599]  Might have to, okay, I'm told that I still have the connection.
[02:11:58.100 --> 02:12:00.642]  We don't know what's in this vaccine.
[02:12:02.439 --> 02:12:21.443]  At the best, you could say, well, Fauci and the other minions, they're going to be surprised just like all the rest of us when it turns out that this has some kind of a sterilizing effect or other consequences on children yet unborn.
[02:12:22.923 --> 02:12:31.105]  Diester Silvestrol, which sterilized women, that was a drug used in the 50s, an accepted FDA-approved drug.
[02:12:32.094 --> 02:12:38.138]  In Britain, there was another one called thalidomide, which resulted in horrible birth defects.
[02:12:39.319 --> 02:12:46.123]  So we might not know the effects of this vaccination program for years or even for decades.
[02:12:46.403 --> 02:12:55.829]  For, you know, babies in the womb today might not know until they grow up and turn out to be sterile or worse birth defects.
[02:12:57.070 --> 02:12:57.971]  But it doesn't matter.
[02:12:58.351 --> 02:12:59.732]  We've just got to run with it.
[02:13:00.292 --> 02:13:01.193]  Go full speed.
[02:13:01.877 --> 02:13:02.917]  Take the injection.
[02:13:04.358 --> 02:13:14.501]  You turn on the television, whether it's local news, national news, it's either systemic racism or it's COVID vaccine.
[02:13:15.402 --> 02:13:16.482]  Take the vaccine.
[02:13:17.963 --> 02:13:21.344]  I'm sorry for any little bad outro there.
[02:13:22.184 --> 02:13:24.605]  Kind of a few little Skype technical issues here.
[02:13:25.985 --> 02:13:30.787]  But this vaccine, if we're forced to take it, and by forced,
[02:13:31.597 --> 02:13:35.818]  I think Tucker's done a terrific job last night on the opening, as has been mentioned.
[02:13:36.998 --> 02:13:52.582]  If you have to take the vaccine to go back to school, if you have to take the vaccine to get on an airplane or to get on a cruise ship, you know, if you have to take the vaccine in the military, an experimental vaccine,
[02:13:53.430 --> 02:14:04.975]  I remember back during the Kuwait Desert Storm era, troops were forced to take the anthrax vaccine and other vaccines, but at least they weren't experimental.
[02:14:05.415 --> 02:14:07.877]  They had, in some way or another, been approved.
[02:14:08.457 --> 02:14:10.978]  They had been out for, you know, for years or decades.
[02:14:11.918 --> 02:14:19.202]  This is something entirely new, and it's not even true to call it an actual vaccine, because it's not.
[02:14:19.462 --> 02:14:22.123]  It's something completely original.
[02:14:22.828 --> 02:14:29.511]  And I would urge anybody that has not seen it to please watch a documentary.
[02:14:30.432 --> 02:14:39.616]  It's two hours, but it's broken into four parts by a blogger named James Corbett, and it's called Who is Bill Gates?
[02:14:40.817 --> 02:14:49.461]  And it goes into detail on the Gates family being three generations of eugenicists.
[02:14:50.556 --> 02:15:02.681]  This myth that Bill Gates was some computer whiz who dreamed up computer ideas in his garage and was sort of like Steve Jobs.
[02:15:02.741 --> 02:15:07.403]  He just came up with Microsoft is completely bogus.
[02:15:07.944 --> 02:15:11.905]  This is all laid out in this documentary, Who is Bill Gates?
[02:15:13.626 --> 02:15:17.908]  He was actually a guy who wasn't a computer genius at all.
[02:15:18.604 --> 02:15:23.148]  But he had a lot of family backing, a lot of family money and legal backing.
[02:15:23.768 --> 02:15:39.160]  So in an era in the 1970s, when computer code was virtually freeware, you know, code writers were sharing this stuff open source, and he got his own legal teams using family money.
[02:15:40.071 --> 02:15:46.136]  To give himself a monopoly on the initial code that he basically ripped off from other people.
[02:15:46.196 --> 02:15:54.823]  But once he, once he patented it and got it copyrighted and under legal protection, that's when the whole Microsoft story began.
[02:15:54.843 --> 02:16:00.107]  It wasn't that Bill Gates was some, you know, genius code writer, not at all.
[02:16:01.128 --> 02:16:07.073]  And in effect, you could look at Bill Gates as using Microsoft
[02:16:07.765 --> 02:16:12.769]  To fund his true family passion, which is eugenics.
[02:16:13.490 --> 02:16:16.352]  He's Bill Gates, the number three, the third.
[02:16:16.952 --> 02:16:27.701]  Going all the way back to the beginning of the 20th century, the Gates family has been involved in eugenics movements, primarily concerned with overpopulation.
[02:16:28.869 --> 02:16:38.055]  Microsoft has given him the money to be at the table during all of the events of the last couple of decades.
[02:16:38.975 --> 02:16:44.139]  He's now one of probably the three most powerful people on Earth.
[02:16:45.960 --> 02:16:48.141]  Forget politicians, they come and they go.
[02:16:48.781 --> 02:16:56.026]  People like Bill Gates buy and sell politicians like they're sheep and goats at the market.
[02:16:57.434 --> 02:17:05.722]  The real power is in these people like Soros and Gates and others, the ones that control these global monopolies.
[02:17:06.483 --> 02:17:16.272]  When you strip it all down, even these big pharma companies, they're just little widgets in these giant global conglomerates.
[02:17:17.073 --> 02:17:19.475]  And this plan has been unfolding for years.
[02:17:20.347 --> 02:17:34.319]  I don't know if we'll be able to see it, maybe in one of the next segments, but I just became aware today of a HBO miniseries that was filmed in 2019, but released in September of 2020.
[02:17:34.539 --> 02:17:37.822]  And it was called Utopia.
[02:17:39.283 --> 02:17:43.187]  It's not to be confused with a British version, which was released in 2013.
[02:17:43.807 --> 02:17:46.950]  So if you're looking for it, if you're searching for it on a video platform,
[02:17:48.002 --> 02:17:52.987]  Look for Utopia 2020, starring Bill Cusack.
[02:17:53.948 --> 02:18:11.225]  And it's basically what we've been seeing, which is these global villains using a new pandemic as a pretext to roll out a vaccine, which, in truth, is a sterilization tool.
[02:18:12.446 --> 02:18:18.087]  Because they're convinced that overpopulation is the big threat to the world.
[02:18:18.767 --> 02:18:20.468]  And they're not going to kill anybody.
[02:18:20.688 --> 02:18:21.528]  That's the plan.
[02:18:21.588 --> 02:18:24.909]  They're not going to actually put out a poison that kills people.
[02:18:25.729 --> 02:18:28.649]  It's just going to sterilize three generations.
[02:18:29.950 --> 02:18:42.032]  And it's just extremely creepy that this film was produced just as they were doing their pandemic planning
[02:18:42.819 --> 02:18:48.304]  Yeah, they're, I forget the name of it, Global 2001.
[02:18:49.345 --> 02:19:00.195]  This was the, all of these same big shots, you know, Gabe Soros, Rockefellers, all of them meeting in New York, talking about how they're going to manage this planet.
[02:19:01.096 --> 02:19:05.019]  That's when this film was produced, and it was released in 2020.
[02:19:05.439 --> 02:19:08.122]  It was canceled after eight episodes because
[02:19:08.680 --> 02:19:38.133]  People found it just too creepy, extremely violent, and just way too creepy that this film was talking about, you know, literally shoehorning a vaccine on the back of a fairly minor pandemic, but using all of their brainwashing tools, their global control of all TV networks, virtually, you know, every major media platform, control of governments, control of all of the messaging,
[02:19:38.803 --> 02:20:05.325]  To whip up a hysteria about a pandemic and then use it to ramrod a vaccine into people, into the entire global population, for the purpose of sterilizing three generations of humanity, to bring the global population down from, you know, seven or more billion people to a more manageable billion and a half.
[02:20:06.125 --> 02:20:06.566]  Of course,
[02:20:07.273 --> 02:20:21.586]  These global elites, they'll still have their Gulfstream jets, they'll still be, you know, the masters of the world, but they just won't have to deal with the problems of feeding and managing 7 billion, you know, humans.
[02:20:22.146 --> 02:20:27.871]  They're going to, you know, lower it down through sterilization and a slow die-off.
[02:20:28.712 --> 02:20:32.055]  And if this doesn't sound like reality, I don't know what does, but
[02:20:33.168 --> 02:20:48.980]  I recommend watching the segment, the clip that's floating around, you know, talking about the, I guess John Cusack is sort of a, I wouldn't say unnecessarily a Bill Gates, but he's one of the vaccine designers and implementers.
[02:20:49.860 --> 02:20:51.682]  And this is where we are now.
[02:20:52.602 --> 02:20:57.966]  You know, the military itself is in a quandary about how far they can push this.
[02:20:58.787 --> 02:21:01.569]  Can they force soldiers to take the vaccine?
[02:21:02.532 --> 02:21:04.313]  When it's an experimental vaccine.
[02:21:04.373 --> 02:21:11.775]  Until now, it's been illegal for the military to force soldiers to take any experimental vaccine.
[02:21:12.476 --> 02:21:19.078]  But that seems to be changing because these evil forces have complete control of all of the messaging.
[02:21:19.818 --> 02:21:21.919]  There's no counter-message allowed.
[02:21:22.759 --> 02:21:29.342]  Websites that even obliquely talk about the vaccine not being a panacea
[02:21:30.299 --> 02:21:31.920]  Are forced off of the internet.
[02:21:32.521 --> 02:21:36.103]  There's a great website called LifeSiteNews.
[02:21:37.004 --> 02:21:47.532]  It's been pushed off of Twitter, Facebook, just, you know, shunned into the outer reaches because it has expressed even minor doubt about the vaccine.
[02:21:48.553 --> 02:21:58.040]  And I would like to, you know, I hope that Tucker Carlson can stay on the air, you know, for a major network, for a major network at Fox News.
[02:21:58.752 --> 02:22:01.833]  He seems to be pushing the envelope about as far as he can.
[02:22:02.633 --> 02:22:13.517]  Last night's opening was very risky for him, I think, because he's really poking this global Leviathan.
[02:22:14.097 --> 02:22:23.260]  He's almost daring them to take him out, one way or the other, because he is rehashing issues that have gotten
[02:22:24.019 --> 02:22:30.103]  You know, people lower on the food scale, the media food scale, completely banished and banned.
[02:22:31.204 --> 02:22:35.888]  So I wonder what they're going to do to take out Tucker Carlson.
[02:22:36.668 --> 02:22:42.432]  Because this is really going to be the Rubicon, the turning point.
[02:22:43.093 --> 02:22:47.456]  If they can force us to take the vaccine, freedom's dead.
[02:22:48.397 --> 02:22:49.497]  And that's just a fact.
[02:22:50.558 --> 02:22:52.540]  You know, if anybody doubts that
[02:22:53.536 --> 02:22:56.017]  That normal American life is done.
[02:22:56.037 --> 02:23:09.865]  I think that we started getting the idea when, when things happened like Roger Stone being arrested in the, you know, the pre-dawn raid with the CNN cameras rolling.
[02:23:10.926 --> 02:23:20.591]  But now with, you know, Rudy Giuliani being, his house being raided, not arrested yet, but, you know, America's mayor, Rudy Giuliani,
[02:23:21.477 --> 02:23:31.024]  Rated by the FBI for electronic devices that were freely offered, you know, as if he's a flight risk, he's going to take off to Paraguay or somewhere.
[02:23:31.865 --> 02:23:37.229]  This is the FBI being fully turned into the Democrat Party Stasi.
[02:23:38.310 --> 02:23:40.551]  There is absolutely no question about this.
[02:23:41.552 --> 02:23:50.479]  And if we shy away from this topic, if we just pretend that everything is okay, and we're just going to somehow
[02:23:51.161 --> 02:23:55.103]  Come through in 22, the GOP is going to have a big victory.
[02:23:55.823 --> 02:23:57.404]  Everything will be back to normal.
[02:23:58.445 --> 02:23:59.225]  I don't believe it.
[02:24:00.246 --> 02:24:18.415]  The Department of Justice, which has also been completely politicized and weaponized, even the FISA court, you know, some of the bad actors from the Russia hoax, like Mary McCord, she's now working at the FISA court as a consultant.
[02:24:19.252 --> 02:24:29.360]  So this is literally putting the fox with the bloody teeth in charge of the hen house the next night after the Big Hen Massacre.
[02:24:30.461 --> 02:24:39.469]  This is when the Democrats and the Department of Justice and the FBI just don't care anymore.
[02:24:39.909 --> 02:24:41.771]  They don't care that we know.
[02:24:41.791 --> 02:24:44.493]  It's like the Solzhenitsyn quote.
[02:24:45.123 --> 02:24:55.873]  You know, that the KGB or the Communist Party, they know that we know that it's all a lie, and we know that they know, and it goes on like that.
[02:24:56.233 --> 02:24:59.897]  They just don't care because they feel that they're in total control.
[02:25:00.677 --> 02:25:07.043]  I think that people holding out hope for 2022, you know, just vote harder next time.
[02:25:07.844 --> 02:25:09.506]  I mean, I certainly am going to vote.
[02:25:10.086 --> 02:25:10.927]  Don't get me wrong.
[02:25:11.590 --> 02:25:17.353]  Because I'm going to, you know, keep paddling until the canoe is completely submerged, right?
[02:25:18.093 --> 02:25:26.637]  But as far as I'm concerned, the evil forces in this country are fully and totally in control.
[02:25:27.497 --> 02:25:31.839]  This means that Alex could be arrested, I could be arrested.
[02:25:32.780 --> 02:25:39.723]  They just have to put a face on the wall and then say, go get them team, find the crime.
[02:25:40.345 --> 02:25:43.946]  And if you can't find the crime, plant something on his computer.
[02:25:44.667 --> 02:25:47.228]  They've already been doing this for years.
[02:25:47.968 --> 02:25:51.289]  Cheryl Atkinson has written a couple of excellent books about this.
[02:25:52.369 --> 02:25:55.510]  She had information planted on her computer.
[02:25:56.851 --> 02:26:07.775]  The people doing this didn't understand that her hard drive, her computer tower, was right next to her bed because she was constantly up and down checking things.
[02:26:08.519 --> 02:26:34.305]  So when her hard drive would go into, you know, turbo spin mode for no reason, you know, for 20 minutes or half an hour at a time in the middle of the night, she took the tower into her own IT consultants, you know, computer security people, ex-government people, and they found all of this classified information had been planted inside of her computer.
[02:26:35.058 --> 02:26:39.280]  No doubt to facilitate an arrest at a later date.
[02:26:39.800 --> 02:26:42.021]  This is your FBI today.
[02:26:43.281 --> 02:26:46.382]  They are no different than the KGB or the Stasi.
[02:26:48.023 --> 02:26:56.786]  And I know a lot of people are very shy about talking about this because they don't want to get the Roger Stone treatment or the Paul Manafort treatment.
[02:26:58.607 --> 02:27:04.089]  What surprised them was how brave Roger Stone was that he didn't just buckle
[02:27:04.930 --> 02:27:06.852]  And read the prepared script.
[02:27:07.012 --> 02:27:16.919]  If he had turned Judas against Donald Trump and read the script they wanted him to read, he wouldn't have lost his house.
[02:27:16.979 --> 02:27:19.781]  He wouldn't have lost his livelihood, his life savings.
[02:27:20.622 --> 02:27:22.183]  They do this to break people.
[02:27:22.944 --> 02:27:29.689]  So I'm not sure what Roger is doing in terms of fundraising right now.
[02:27:30.615 --> 02:27:34.578]  But, um, I have to, you know, make a note to revisit this.
[02:27:35.378 --> 02:27:43.904]  And because they've basically financially ruined the man to the point of, uh, of absolute impoverishment.
[02:27:44.624 --> 02:27:49.248]  So if they can't put you in prison, they can almost put you on the street.
[02:27:50.008 --> 02:27:55.031]  This is your Department of Justice and your FBI today.
[02:27:55.772 --> 02:27:56.793]  And shame on them.
[02:27:57.613 --> 02:27:58.554]  If somehow,
[02:28:00.037 --> 02:28:07.644]  Constitutional minded people ever take control of this country again, maybe there will be a day of reckoning.
[02:28:08.084 --> 02:28:25.479]  But I seriously doubt it because the people who pulled the entire Russiagate scam, the FBI agents who had Hunter Biden's laptop and knew all about all the truth about Ukraine and Burisma and the Biden corruption,
[02:28:26.238 --> 02:28:34.001]  They had that right during the Donald Trump impeachment, the Ukraine impeachment, and they kept it hidden.
[02:28:35.381 --> 02:28:46.586]  They're as corrupt and dirty and evil as the worst corrupt old machine city police department ever.
[02:28:46.706 --> 02:28:50.907]  The Serpico era New York vice cops.
[02:28:51.487 --> 02:28:55.369]  They're just dripping with evil corruption.
[02:28:56.465 --> 02:29:04.689]  And a shame on them for wearing that badge, that gold FBI badge, which they'll sometimes flash as if it still means anything.
[02:29:06.270 --> 02:29:20.698]  A friend of mine knows somebody who's been visited by the FBI and they've now gotten so woke that the female agent had multicolored fingernails
[02:29:21.829 --> 02:29:28.530]  With the index fingers over an inch long, the male had tattoos on the backs of his hands and fingers.
[02:29:29.211 --> 02:29:36.072]  This tells me, and nothing wrong with that folks, but we're talking about the FBI, alright?
[02:29:36.592 --> 02:29:40.853]  They've gone fully hard woke.
[02:29:41.033 --> 02:29:45.314]  They are completely captured now by the hard left.
[02:29:46.254 --> 02:29:50.235]  They are looking at us, you know, constitutional conservatives,
[02:29:51.048 --> 02:30:11.454]  As their enemies of the state, and they feel totally emboldened to frame, to perjure themselves, to plant evidence, to create evidence, to solicit perjury by threatening people with hard jail time in order to get at their other victims.
[02:30:12.654 --> 02:30:15.875]  This is the very dangerous era that we are in now.
[02:30:17.040 --> 02:30:22.121]  And the next thing is going to be turning the military loose on Americans.
[02:30:23.722 --> 02:30:25.922]  I mean, no posse comitatus?
[02:30:26.582 --> 02:30:32.144]  Who cares about that when you've turned the FBI into the KGB and Stasi?
[02:30:33.424 --> 02:30:37.685]  You really think they're going to care about turning the military against Americans now?
[02:30:37.705 --> 02:30:45.747]  I mean, right in the Constitution it says that the military is to protect our country from invasion.
[02:30:46.673 --> 02:31:00.655]  While the executive branch opens the floodgates for an invasion and has buses running 24 hours a day taking illegals into every American city in order to tip the electoral balance.
[02:31:01.636 --> 02:31:06.916]  So do you really think that they're going to have any qualms about turning the military loose against us?
[02:31:09.057 --> 02:31:10.317]  These are dark days, folks.
[02:31:10.497 --> 02:31:12.797]  I wish I wasn't so black-billed, but I am.
[02:31:13.397 --> 02:31:16.078]  You know, I don't know how Alex does it.
[02:31:18.226 --> 02:31:32.029]  It is really gut-wrenching for me to do this, and I can't even imagine doing this for a couple hours every day, as well as all of the off-air show prep and running a business.
[02:31:33.070 --> 02:31:36.891]  I can't even imagine, because this just pulls it out of me.
[02:31:37.371 --> 02:31:39.131]  I don't like talking about these things.
[02:31:39.151 --> 02:31:41.052]  I wish that I wasn't.
[02:31:42.112 --> 02:31:44.872]  I wish I could be off somewhere writing genre fiction.
[02:31:47.731 --> 02:31:54.113]  Just, you know, silly stuff about detectives and spies and the mafia.
[02:31:54.553 --> 02:31:58.554]  But I can't because now we're actually in it.
[02:31:59.134 --> 02:32:00.395]  We are in the game.
[02:32:01.275 --> 02:32:01.915]  Not the game.
[02:32:01.975 --> 02:32:04.916]  We're in a really a death struggle for our freedom.
[02:32:05.896 --> 02:32:10.898]  The people that are running this operation, they have no intention of backing down.
[02:32:11.681 --> 02:32:24.424]  They think that they now own the entire, they own the bank, the factory, the candy store, they own the supermarket, they own everything and there's nothing we can do about it.
[02:32:25.825 --> 02:32:31.126]  You know, this vaccine is just one more massive power grab.
[02:32:31.826 --> 02:32:39.308]  Can we literally brainwash enough of the people into accepting this gene therapy
[02:32:40.678 --> 02:32:48.842]  So that the rest, the resistors, the holdouts, will feel so much pressure that they'll take it as well.
[02:32:49.503 --> 02:32:53.285]  And that's even before you bring up the issue of shedding.
[02:32:54.005 --> 02:33:08.093]  You're like these Monsanto frankenfood GMO genes that are blowing in the dust and being carried by birds and rodents into fields that were never
[02:33:08.615 --> 02:33:18.261]  You know, using these, these Franken-gene and, and, uh, you know, the, the, uh, Franken-food Monsanto stuff.
[02:33:18.301 --> 02:33:18.661]  I'm sorry.
[02:33:18.681 --> 02:33:25.565]  I'm just... But what are we going to do if, if, um, we're just backed into the corner?
[02:33:26.486 --> 02:33:30.828]  You know, I think that, and it's a, it's a theme of mine.
[02:33:32.509 --> 02:33:37.192]  Not everything in this country is going to happen in the same way
[02:33:38.194 --> 02:33:45.036]  You know, from from state to state and city to city, there's going to be very different outcomes.
[02:33:46.036 --> 02:34:00.900]  If you compare, for example, Florida and Michigan, you have a governor of Michigan putting, you know, two year olds on to mandatory mask outside lockdown, no schools,
[02:34:02.267 --> 02:34:11.192]  Saying that unless the people will get to a certain percentage of vaccine acceptance, she won't open businesses.
[02:34:11.372 --> 02:34:14.654]  You know, she's literally got a scale, Governor Whitmer.
[02:34:14.874 --> 02:34:28.921]  She has like a time scale based on vaccination acceptance that she's essentially holding a gun to the heads of people saying, you take the vaccine or we just keep the economy locked down.
[02:34:29.779 --> 02:34:35.702]  Meanwhile, she herself flew to Florida on a private Gulfstream jet.
[02:34:36.603 --> 02:34:53.511]  You know, that she asked, quote unquote, air quotes, asked these corporate bosses if she could, you know, use one of their fractional ownership Gulfstreams to make a little side trip to Florida while she's lying about never leaving the state.
[02:34:54.252 --> 02:34:58.654]  This is the kind of ruler that the worst states are going to have.
[02:34:59.338 --> 02:35:08.064]  Meanwhile, I'm in Florida, and my governor, Ron DeSantis, at least is trying as much as is humanly possible.
[02:35:08.684 --> 02:35:16.570]  They're passing laws saying that there can be no mandatory vaccination, not at colleges, not by businesses.
[02:35:17.450 --> 02:35:28.578]  But we'll see how far that goes, because Florida is also a big home for the cruise ship industry, and the cruise lines are saying no vaccination, no boarding the ship.
[02:35:29.790 --> 02:35:33.932]  You can say that a cruise ship, that's completely voluntary.
[02:35:33.992 --> 02:35:35.073]  It's just a vacation.
[02:35:35.113 --> 02:35:36.274]  So don't go on the cruise ship.
[02:35:36.354 --> 02:35:43.278]  And I get it, but it's a, it's another issue of can the governor of Florida really control these things?
[02:35:43.438 --> 02:35:50.182]  Or will the next step be a private college saying, if you don't take the vaccination, your kid can't come back to school.
[02:35:50.962 --> 02:35:56.065]  So there's a real push and pull going on, but at least in Florida,
[02:35:56.781 --> 02:36:03.466]  The governor and the legislature is trying to push back against these forces of totalitarianism.
[02:36:04.047 --> 02:36:09.752]  You know, he's also going against big tech and social media, you know, for banning conservatives.
[02:36:10.692 --> 02:36:22.482]  So the only really hopeful, helpful advice I can give is to get away from the areas that are predictably going to be the worst.
[02:36:23.260 --> 02:36:30.505]  Yeah, it's like a volcano zone when you live on the slope of Vesuvius and it starts to rumble.
[02:36:31.105 --> 02:36:32.166]  Well, why don't you move?
[02:36:32.906 --> 02:36:40.331]  Because it's going to get really bad, but it's going to be much worse in some areas than in some other areas.
[02:36:40.952 --> 02:36:46.896]  Now, the real estate market in the states where people are moving is going kind of crazy.
[02:36:46.976 --> 02:36:50.278]  So you're going to have a hard time finding a house or an apartment.
[02:36:50.358 --> 02:36:51.199]  I understand that.
[02:36:52.199 --> 02:36:53.020]  Here in Florida,
[02:36:53.652 --> 02:37:04.680]  Houses are going on the market, and in an hour, they're getting offers, you know, 10 and 15 percent over the asking price.
[02:37:05.301 --> 02:37:06.502]  Over the asking price.
[02:37:06.982 --> 02:37:12.106]  People are showing up with cash in suitcases to buy houses.
[02:37:12.766 --> 02:37:17.810]  People are buying houses even over the internet without even visiting.
[02:37:18.631 --> 02:37:21.393]  This is showing you this osmotic pressure
[02:37:22.156 --> 02:37:29.279]  That the people in the Marxist-oriented dictator states are getting out.
[02:37:29.940 --> 02:37:31.340]  Don't be left behind.
[02:37:31.360 --> 02:37:46.248]  This is sort of like the end of the Second World War when Germany and Eastern Europe were on their backs with occupying forces, Soviets in the East, Americans and British in the West.
[02:37:47.642 --> 02:37:52.327]  But there was still time for people to get a wagon and leave.
[02:37:52.767 --> 02:37:59.774]  You know, put their family, pick up the bundles, get anything that has wheels and drag it west.
[02:38:01.035 --> 02:38:05.320]  The Iron Curtain didn't go up the day after VE Day.
[02:38:06.377 --> 02:38:07.078]  It did not.
[02:38:07.538 --> 02:38:21.572]  There were still months, and even in some cases years, for people who could read the tea leaves to get the hell out of what was going to become communist Iron Curtain countries.
[02:38:23.092 --> 02:38:28.835]  And a lot of their neighbors probably just said, Oh, the Soviets, they're not going to do that.
[02:38:28.855 --> 02:38:35.819]  They're going to, they're probably going to go back to Russia or, or, you know, I was a socialist in college and the socialists are okay.
[02:38:35.859 --> 02:38:36.959]  So what's the problem?
[02:38:37.780 --> 02:38:42.682]  The people that could see that could read the tea leaves said, no, get out.
[02:38:43.763 --> 02:38:50.627]  Like a lot of the, a lot of the Jews in Germany in the 1930s, they were reading the tea leaves and they said, get out.
[02:38:52.324 --> 02:38:55.065]  You just don't wait for Hitler to be voted out.
[02:38:55.145 --> 02:38:57.186]  He's not going to be voted out.
[02:38:57.727 --> 02:39:00.268]  The military is not going to get rid of Hitler.
[02:39:00.288 --> 02:39:07.391]  The smart people in Germany that saw what was happening, they told their families, we're leaving.
[02:39:07.731 --> 02:39:08.892]  We're walking away.
[02:39:09.012 --> 02:39:13.574]  In many cases, they didn't even pack because they didn't want to alert their neighbors.
[02:39:14.214 --> 02:39:15.395]  They just left.
[02:39:16.562 --> 02:39:29.853]  And this is the kind of a shakeup that's going to go on in the United States because there's no way, as much as they try, you know, I don't know if it's, if it's now they're saying it's Ron Klain is Biden's brains.
[02:39:29.893 --> 02:39:33.096]  Whenever I say Biden, I really mean Biden's handlers.
[02:39:33.636 --> 02:39:45.466]  There's no way that Biden's handlers can institute this, these draconian measures equally, equally across all 50 states, but they are planning it.
[02:39:46.141 --> 02:39:48.042]  You know, they are purging the military.
[02:39:48.543 --> 02:39:52.065]  They've already purged the CIA and Department of Justice.
[02:39:52.625 --> 02:39:57.968]  They've already got them running as, you know, as little Marxist organizations.
[02:39:58.769 --> 02:40:13.338]  But the rest of the government and the military is engaged in this purge now, where white conservative men are the absolute, you know, in this scenario, they are the Kulaks.
[02:40:14.025 --> 02:40:22.532]  Or the landlords in a Chinese context, or the German Jews in the Nazi context.
[02:40:23.452 --> 02:40:25.814]  They are purging them out of the military.
[02:40:26.275 --> 02:40:36.643]  What do you think they're going to use the military for once it's fully purged and the only people left are the woke cultural Marxists?
[02:40:37.793 --> 02:40:40.774]  Do you think they're going to stick to the constitution?
[02:40:40.854 --> 02:40:42.995]  Do you think they care about the constitution?
[02:40:43.715 --> 02:40:44.335]  Not at all.
[02:40:45.135 --> 02:40:45.676]  Not a bit.
[02:40:46.376 --> 02:40:53.558]  You know, if you, um, if you, if you buy my, my printed books, you don't have to get them from Bezos.
[02:40:53.578 --> 02:40:54.678]  You can get them from me.
[02:40:54.738 --> 02:40:58.960]  If you look at my website, enemies, foreign and domestic.com.
[02:41:00.380 --> 02:41:05.702]  The reason I wrote them was so that when the timing became really critical, like right now,
[02:41:06.454 --> 02:41:08.535]  I might have some kind of an input.
[02:41:09.335 --> 02:41:24.703]  So to that extent, my books have succeeded because here I am very, very grateful to Alex Jones and the InfoWars team for giving me this chance, you know, to continue my prognosticating.
[02:41:25.964 --> 02:41:35.869]  Now, this mandatory vaccine, whether it's the government mandating it or private industry mandating it, it doesn't, it really means the same thing because
[02:41:36.545 --> 02:41:41.686]  We're now into an era of corporate tyranny or corporatism.
[02:41:42.827 --> 02:41:52.449]  Where does the government end and Google, Alphabet, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, where they begin?
[02:41:52.469 --> 02:41:59.231]  We've already seen senior people from Google going to work in the White House, for example.
[02:42:00.006 --> 02:42:05.529]  So it's really meaningless to say, well, you know, they're a private company and they can do what they like.
[02:42:05.590 --> 02:42:13.154]  They can ban the former president of the United States from posting on Twitter because they're a private company.
[02:42:13.594 --> 02:42:16.056]  But they're working hand-in-glove with the government.
[02:42:17.437 --> 02:42:19.898]  This is another definition of fascism.
[02:42:21.379 --> 02:42:25.842]  Except under fascism, the government is controlling the industry.
[02:42:26.502 --> 02:42:27.163]  In this case,
[02:42:27.935 --> 02:42:33.439]  The power might have shifted so dramatically that the industry is now controlling the government.
[02:42:33.939 --> 02:42:40.443]  I mean, nobody that I know believes that Joe Biden got 80 million votes, right?
[02:42:41.564 --> 02:42:48.989]  This whole massive chicanery was pulled off with huge help from
[02:42:49.770 --> 02:42:55.691]  The big tech, the global corporate big tech, they didn't want Trump.
[02:42:55.711 --> 02:43:00.733]  He's not a globalist and that's enough to set the dogs against him.
[02:43:01.373 --> 02:43:08.314]  The Department of Justice weaponized with, you know, two fake impeachments plus the Russia hoax.
[02:43:08.655 --> 02:43:11.495]  This is a full machine now.
[02:43:12.395 --> 02:43:14.296]  It's not just the government or
[02:43:15.342 --> 02:43:18.684]  Over their private industry and sometimes they're collaborating.
[02:43:18.724 --> 02:43:22.486]  No, they are all part of the same Leviathan.
[02:43:22.506 --> 02:43:29.690]  And sometimes I've struggled for a way to understand this.
[02:43:29.810 --> 02:43:40.636]  How can a small global elite, no matter how rich and powerful, how can they control this entire world, the entire population?
[02:43:41.488 --> 02:43:47.531]  And I, just before the show, and I just made like a little graphic to understand this.
[02:43:48.071 --> 02:43:50.432]  I look at this like a pyramid, okay?
[02:43:51.212 --> 02:43:55.674]  And at the top are pure satanic forces.
[02:43:56.534 --> 02:44:01.896]  These are, you know, these you can understand in religious terms as, you know, Lucifer.
[02:44:03.357 --> 02:44:04.537]  Pure evil.
[02:44:05.098 --> 02:44:08.159]  People that just want to see suffering.
[02:44:09.033 --> 02:44:21.701]  They'll literally make a deal with the devil to keep their own Gulf Stream jets and private islands, but more than their own personal greed and lust for power, they're like arsonists.
[02:44:22.162 --> 02:44:23.342]  They're sociopaths.
[02:44:24.023 --> 02:44:26.044]  They want to see the world burn.
[02:44:26.985 --> 02:44:33.309]  And they're at the very pinnacle and generally unseen, but below them,
[02:44:34.276 --> 02:44:45.861]  And so I just made this little, I made this little, it's not working too good here, but below them on the pyramid, you have dedicated, knowing, witting, communist traitors.
[02:44:46.802 --> 02:44:49.163]  They hate America because America is a
[02:44:49.961 --> 02:44:56.403]  Sovereign, powerful, superpower, doing more good than bad in the world, I would say.
[02:44:56.483 --> 02:45:01.085]  I mean, after World War II, we could have just picked up where Great Britain left off.
[02:45:01.525 --> 02:45:04.346]  We didn't want to make out-and-out colonies.
[02:45:05.346 --> 02:45:14.029]  Japan had and still has American troops there, but they're not goose-stepping around, you know, ordering people what to do.
[02:45:14.818 --> 02:45:15.918]  Same thing in Germany.
[02:45:16.718 --> 02:45:19.659]  We've had a pretty light hand as far as empires go.
[02:45:20.259 --> 02:45:26.060]  But this is not enough for the dedicated, you know, the witting, knowing communists.
[02:45:26.781 --> 02:45:29.861]  I would certainly put John Brennan in that list.
[02:45:30.962 --> 02:45:34.342]  I would certainly put the new director of the CIA in that list.
[02:45:34.822 --> 02:45:37.083]  He is a stooge of the CCP.
[02:45:37.955 --> 02:45:50.141]  Now, you could almost say that there has been a takeover, that it's gone beyond just that we have leaders who are witting communists, you know, hiding in plain sight.
[02:45:50.181 --> 02:45:53.142]  Of course, they're not going to put the hammer and sickle up hell.
[02:45:53.962 --> 02:45:56.123]  You know, a lapel pin on, yet.
[02:45:56.543 --> 02:46:00.165]  They're not going to run the hammer and sickle up over the White House, yet.
[02:46:00.586 --> 02:46:02.307]  So they're still speaking in code.
[02:46:02.727 --> 02:46:21.177]  But it's clear, how does a guy who voted for, you know, the Communist Party during the Cold War, when the gulags were running full blast in the Soviet Union, during the Cultural Revolution in China, when millions were being, you know, were being murdered,
[02:46:21.866 --> 02:46:29.090]  How does a guy like that not only get into the CIA, but rise to the very top of the CIA?
[02:46:29.710 --> 02:46:30.851]  Well, I'll tell you.
[02:46:32.152 --> 02:46:33.332]  It's with a lot of help.
[02:46:34.253 --> 02:46:44.078]  At the top of the pyramid, the satanic forces, they use their power, their evil satanic power, to leverage
[02:46:44.645 --> 02:46:48.087]  The most useful tools to the top of the pyramid.
[02:46:48.548 --> 02:47:03.558]  This is how you get a Barack Obama, who to me is like a living embodiment of a Rosemary's Baby or Damien from the Omen series, literally the spawn of Satan.
[02:47:04.179 --> 02:47:11.504]  How does he, this mystery man, slide through elite colleges purportedly
[02:47:12.208 --> 02:47:13.949]  And the next thing you know, he's a senator.
[02:47:14.029 --> 02:47:15.730]  The next thing you know, he's a president.
[02:47:16.251 --> 02:47:20.213]  It's with help from the satanic forces at the top.
[02:47:20.753 --> 02:47:31.060]  Now, just below on the pyramid, below the knowing communist traitors, you know, the John Brennan's, you have
[02:47:31.604 --> 02:47:33.685]  Cultural Marxists.
[02:47:34.165 --> 02:47:34.866]  They're woke.
[02:47:35.386 --> 02:47:36.247]  They're leftist.
[02:47:36.707 --> 02:47:40.309]  They believe, you know, the BS, the brainwashing.
[02:47:40.689 --> 02:47:42.110]  They're fully brainwashed.
[02:47:42.230 --> 02:47:44.671]  They do believe there are 57 genders.
[02:47:45.131 --> 02:47:47.993]  And if tomorrow you say there's 72, they'll believe that.
[02:47:48.513 --> 02:47:52.955]  And if you say it's actually, you know, six genders, they'll believe that.
[02:47:53.076 --> 02:47:55.837]  Because they'll believe anything they're told.
[02:47:56.277 --> 02:47:57.658]  They're cultural Marxists.
[02:47:58.158 --> 02:47:59.359]  They're automatons.
[02:47:59.419 --> 02:48:00.900]  They don't do their own thinking.
[02:48:01.580 --> 02:48:10.943]  But they know that what they've been told in school from grade school on, that America is an evil empire, you know, based on racism and slavery.
[02:48:11.303 --> 02:48:13.584]  That's all it is, and it has to be destroyed.
[02:48:14.064 --> 02:48:15.525]  They're first-level thinkers.
[02:48:15.885 --> 02:48:18.045]  That's the extent of their understanding.
[02:48:18.606 --> 02:48:21.667]  They're just brainwashed people that do as they're told.
[02:48:21.687 --> 02:48:25.608]  And below them, you just have apathetic,
[02:48:26.295 --> 02:48:33.339]  You know, useful idiots, just sheeple, people that just want to watch TV and entertain themselves.
[02:48:33.359 --> 02:48:37.301]  It's a stretch to even call them first-level thinkers.
[02:48:37.901 --> 02:48:53.409]  They're just reactive, just like, you know, like an animal just moving around the farm, not even knowing why the gates open and close, not even knowing why the food appears sometimes and doesn't appear other times.
[02:48:54.238 --> 02:49:02.125]  And at the very bottom of the pyramid, unfortunately, it's terrible, this blue screen, is us, the normal people.
[02:49:02.365 --> 02:49:13.915]  So we're most of the population, but we're being controlled by levers of power, tiny, tiny but powerful forces at the very top, the satanic forces.
[02:49:14.881 --> 02:49:31.626]  Who opened the doors for the knowing, witting communists who have a life mission of destroying the United States of America in order to usher in Communism 2.0, which in their version is globalism.
[02:49:32.386 --> 02:49:41.569]  And they use the brainwashing process to brainwash the easily duped cultural Marxists and useful idiots.
[02:49:42.318 --> 02:49:43.599]  And what do we do about it?
[02:49:43.759 --> 02:49:47.961]  How do you resist this when so much is stacked on top of us?
[02:49:48.502 --> 02:49:56.306]  Well, the power is stacked on top of us, but at the very least, you don't go along with it.
[02:49:56.986 --> 02:49:58.207]  You know, you fight back.
[02:49:58.347 --> 02:50:04.711]  When people say that gender is just a construct, call them idiots.
[02:50:05.276 --> 02:50:05.836]  Say no.
[02:50:06.237 --> 02:50:09.519]  There are two sexes, two genders.
[02:50:09.619 --> 02:50:10.120]  That's it.
[02:50:10.540 --> 02:50:13.542]  Then there's gender dysphoria, but it doesn't count.
[02:50:14.243 --> 02:50:20.768]  If somebody says they're Napoleon, you don't have to go along with their fantasy.
[02:50:21.529 --> 02:50:24.010]  You just say, I'm sorry, you have a mental problem.
[02:50:24.751 --> 02:50:26.853]  The key is to push back.
[02:50:27.873 --> 02:50:32.337]  Don't just quietly go along hoping that this ship is going to right itself.
[02:50:33.345 --> 02:50:38.228]  That's like the Poiseidon Adventure when the ship is at 90 degrees and going down.
[02:50:38.388 --> 02:50:41.150]  No, you can't wait for it to right itself.
[02:50:41.610 --> 02:50:48.354]  You have to come out with a new strategy to escape from the ship because this ship is not going to right itself.
[02:50:49.575 --> 02:50:53.277]  And it's going to be up to all of us to survive as best we can.
[02:50:57.774 --> 02:51:02.175]  Operation Endgame, thanks to you taking action, has been a huge success.
[02:51:02.595 --> 02:51:07.336]  More than 20,000 of this historic film, made 14 years ago, have gone out in the last three weeks.
[02:51:07.696 --> 02:51:17.699]  And we are going to continue this sale of selling them for $3.95 apiece when you buy them in bulk at MFORESTORE.COM running through next Friday, May 15th.
[02:51:18.499 --> 02:51:19.440]  It's an incredible film.
[02:51:19.500 --> 02:51:20.822]  It exposes the Great Reset.
[02:51:21.302 --> 02:51:23.144]  The Globalists have been censoring this documentary.
[02:51:23.165 --> 02:51:24.025]  They're very, very scared of it.
[02:51:24.366 --> 02:51:26.408]  So get it and give it to friends and family.
[02:51:26.428 --> 02:51:27.269]  Give it to libraries.
[02:51:27.509 --> 02:51:28.310]  Give it to your pastors.
[02:51:28.330 --> 02:51:29.892]  Whatever you do, take action.
[02:51:30.032 --> 02:51:34.037]  Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement is a two and a half hour documentary.
[02:51:34.337 --> 02:51:36.720]  The extras are extremely informative as well.
[02:51:37.196 --> 02:51:39.078]  This is the film that predicted it all.
[02:51:39.158 --> 02:51:42.202]  It's more powerful now, 14 years later.
[02:51:42.262 --> 02:51:45.426]  Like fine wine, it is aging, getting better, not worse.
[02:51:45.706 --> 02:51:46.347]  It's evergreen.
[02:51:46.627 --> 02:51:55.778]  Get yours while you still can for $3.95 apiece in bulk at InfoWarsTore.com and be part of Operation Endgame at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:51:57.645 --> 02:52:05.948]  Listeners have rightfully been complaining the last six months or so saying, where are most of the best selling products you have that we love?
[02:52:06.308 --> 02:52:08.569]  And my answer is the supply chain has broken down.
[02:52:09.189 --> 02:52:12.531]  I have to either reformulate or I have to lower the quality to get a lot of these.
[02:52:12.831 --> 02:52:15.031]  And so that's why we don't have a lot of products in.
[02:52:15.231 --> 02:52:19.413]  That's why InfoWars is in financial trouble is because if we had the products, you would be buying it.
[02:52:19.473 --> 02:52:22.154]  We have the money, but so many of them have been sold out.
[02:52:22.514 --> 02:52:24.495]  Just like you notice a lot of other items at the store.
[02:52:24.735 --> 02:52:25.015]  I think so.
[02:52:41.869 --> 02:52:43.470]  We'll have to go back to near full price.
[02:52:43.911 --> 02:52:44.851]  Take advantage of this now.
[02:52:45.132 --> 02:52:45.592]  Stock up.
[02:52:45.692 --> 02:52:46.693]  And don't forget to take your X2.
[02:52:46.793 --> 02:52:50.756]  Because I have a tendency to forget how great it is and not take it myself.
[02:52:50.776 --> 02:52:54.419]  But when I do, stamina, libido, energy, weight loss, it's incredible.
[02:52:54.479 --> 02:52:55.099]  It's essential.
[02:52:55.359 --> 02:52:57.021]  It's X2 at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:52:57.561 --> 02:53:02.605]  All of our supplements, all of our products are the highest grade that we are able to get.
[02:53:02.965 --> 02:53:08.388]  That is something I guarantee to you and your family and I respect you and I appreciate your support.
[02:53:08.468 --> 02:53:13.392]  You are funding an organization that tirelessly, fearlessly takes on the global.
[02:53:14.032 --> 02:53:16.353]  I really appreciate you keeping me in the fight.
[02:53:16.653 --> 02:53:17.593]  I'm willing to go to prison.
[02:53:17.633 --> 02:53:21.695]  I'm willing to die to fight these globalists, to fight these pedophiles, to fight these satanists.
[02:53:22.055 --> 02:53:27.717]  But I can't stay in the attack, in the fight against these monsters, without your support.
[02:53:27.757 --> 02:53:29.858]  So again, I want to thank you and your family.
[02:53:29.878 --> 02:53:37.640]  I want to thank everybody in your orbit that has supported you so you can support me and this operation because we are all in this together.
[02:53:37.660 --> 02:53:39.821]  I want to thank you for your parents having you.
[02:53:39.901 --> 02:53:40.381]  I'm serious.
[02:53:40.641 --> 02:53:42.022]  I appreciate you.
[02:53:43.473 --> 02:53:44.113]  It's that simple.
[02:53:44.133 --> 02:53:49.496]  That's why when you call in to thank me, I get a little bit irritated sometimes because you are the reason we're still on air.
[02:53:49.916 --> 02:53:54.698]  You are the raft on which I'm out in this rough sea, literally surviving.
[02:53:55.218 --> 02:53:56.679]  And you can say vice versa.
[02:53:57.479 --> 02:53:58.880]  I'm the raft that you're on as well.
[02:53:59.420 --> 02:54:01.701]  We are symbiotically in this together.
[02:54:02.501 --> 02:54:06.365]  Now, speaking of the ocean, we have the highest quality fish oil.
[02:54:06.405 --> 02:54:09.548]  It's been sold out for months and months and months because the supply chain's broken down.
[02:54:09.949 --> 02:54:15.114]  And I could easily lower the quality of the grade of the fish oil and never be out.
[02:54:15.454 --> 02:54:18.878]  But when you go with the highest quality, it is hard to keep it in, especially
[02:54:19.278 --> 02:54:24.144]  With the COVID lockdowns around the world that are now causing serious supply chains across the planet.
[02:54:24.644 --> 02:54:27.948]  We finally got Ultimate Fish Oil back in stock.
[02:54:28.168 --> 02:54:30.051]  It's 50% off out of the gates.
[02:54:30.411 --> 02:54:34.376]  Ultimate Krill Oil is about to sell out, but despite that it's 25% off.
[02:54:34.796 --> 02:54:36.438]  Get them together for 50% off as a combo.
[02:54:38.683 --> 02:54:46.190]  Now again, fish oil is incredible for your heart, for your liver, for your cells, for your cardiovascular, for your brain, for your sleep, for everything.
[02:54:46.290 --> 02:54:46.870]  It's amazing.
[02:54:47.130 --> 02:54:48.912]  And this stuff is really great.
[02:54:49.112 --> 02:54:50.433]  It's the highest grade out there.
[02:54:50.794 --> 02:54:51.774]  So is our krill oil.
[02:54:52.055 --> 02:54:55.718]  It's available again at InfoWareStore.com and in front of the InfoWare.
