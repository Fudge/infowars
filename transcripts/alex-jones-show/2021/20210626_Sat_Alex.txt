[00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:00.552]  The End.
[00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:31.238]  And so here we are on this Saturday transmission with Shemaine Nugent and Ted Nugent from their bunker, they tell me, out in the beautiful woods of Michigan where they're recording a new hit album.
[00:00:31.778 --> 00:00:35.401]  So much happening here in the country, the best of times, the worst of times it seems.
[00:00:36.081 --> 00:00:37.843]  Ted, Shemaine, where do you guys want to start?
[00:00:39.349 --> 00:00:41.631]  Well, I think the best of times, the worst of times.
[00:00:41.691 --> 00:00:55.005]  First of all, every time we get together, Alex, we have a new toxic level of evil and power abuse and criminal misuse of authority by government, media, academia, the punks in Hollywood.
[00:00:55.265 --> 00:00:57.047]  But let's start on a positive note.
[00:00:57.407 --> 00:01:09.991]  That I have Mrs. Nugent at my side, and we got Coco, Happy, and Sadie on the floor of our Sonic Bombast Barn Recording Studio, Man Cave, Cuckoo's Nest, Ammo Dump, Arsenal, Taxidermy Celebration.
[00:01:10.811 --> 00:01:13.432]  Everybody I know, Alex, and I think everybody you know,
[00:01:14.122 --> 00:01:17.627]  We carve out a positive American dream every day.
[00:01:17.687 --> 00:01:19.749]  Everybody I know is in the asset column.
[00:01:19.769 --> 00:01:20.991]  We continue to work hard.
[00:01:21.251 --> 00:01:31.504]  Here in the state of Michigan, the government could not misrepresent us more horribly than they do here in the state of Michigan, like so many states.
[00:01:31.824 --> 00:01:40.109]  But that positive energy, that positive spirit, making the greatest music of my life with Jason and Greg and Mike and Andy and Tim.
[00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.611]  What a positive celebration.
[00:01:42.651 --> 00:01:49.775]  The wildlife is thriving in the swamps of Michigan, but we still combat the evil that is ubiquitous.
[00:01:49.896 --> 00:01:53.278]  It's literally metastasizing at an evil pace.
[00:01:53.298 --> 00:01:55.059]  So a big salute to you, Alex,
[00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:58.662]  For spotlighting these cockroaches and sounding the alarm.
[00:01:59.063 --> 00:02:03.727]  Everybody I know is starting to wake up going, you know, Alex Jones has been right.
[00:02:04.108 --> 00:02:09.052]  Even some of the pundits on some of the major, like my friend Tucker Carlson.
[00:02:09.333 --> 00:02:16.340]  He's given you a nod recently going, you know, you can laugh at Alex Jones, but you're denying the facts and the evidence.
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.601]  So a big salute to you.
[00:02:18.171 --> 00:02:27.080]  You know, I, I'm going to say something that I think you might be surprised and Ted might be surprised because I heard your podcast yesterday and it was kind of dark.
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.765]  And I want to say that this, honestly, I am excited to be alive right now.
[00:02:32.985 --> 00:02:41.634]  This is an incredible time for us to be here on this planet for us, for you and Ted really to be the voices.
[00:02:42.153 --> 00:02:43.374]  And Tucker, a few others.
[00:02:43.734 --> 00:02:51.161]  But you know, in the Bible, we are reminded that not everyone who has eyes can see, not everyone who has ears can hear.
[00:02:51.781 --> 00:02:57.706]  And what you and Ted have always talked about, people are now waking up.
[00:02:58.267 --> 00:03:00.849]  I feel like this is kind of an exciting time.
[00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.431]  Shemaine, I want you to elaborate on that, because some days I'm really upbeat.
[00:03:04.471 --> 00:03:07.473]  Yesterday, the broadcast was fake.
[00:03:07.553 --> 00:03:18.142]  I was kind of down, just really pissed, reading all the evil, horrible things that even the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs was saying about America, and just seeing the Black Lives Matter and Antifa garbage.
[00:03:18.642 --> 00:03:20.523]  Sometimes it gets me down, but you're absolutely right.
[00:03:20.984 --> 00:03:25.587]  We should be positive, because the awakening is so huge that it's happening right now.
[00:03:25.607 --> 00:03:28.389]  Let me ask you that question, though, to both of you, but first, Shemaine.
[00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:34.438]  Why does the left want to attack the refuges that we all try to create to make America good?
[00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:35.861]  Why do they want to dominate?
[00:03:35.941 --> 00:03:38.405]  Why do they destroy every city they're in control of?
[00:03:38.505 --> 00:03:42.831]  Why do they seek out the youth of this country, little children, to try to corrupt them?
[00:03:43.192 --> 00:03:44.254]  What is their problem?
[00:03:45.441 --> 00:04:02.415]  Well, you know, and you've always talked about it, Alex, it's indoctrination, and it's a way of them to pull the cover over our eyes, our children's eyes, and to get them to see things that aren't really true, and to get them indoctrinated into what they want to believe.
[00:04:03.335 --> 00:04:03.515]  Yes.
[00:04:03.655 --> 00:04:03.715]  Yes.
[00:04:24.406 --> 00:04:25.307]  World domination.
[00:04:25.807 --> 00:04:28.789]  Yeah, and Alex, let me do an Uncle Ted Tech Tip.
[00:04:28.829 --> 00:04:39.955]  We've had 30-some years of the Ted Nugent's Spirit of the Wild Show on Outdoor Channel, where we celebrate nature and hands-on conservation, aim small, miss small, marksmanship, and the mystical flight of the aerosol.
[00:04:39.995 --> 00:04:41.356]  Positive, positive, positive.
[00:04:41.616 --> 00:04:46.359]  But I know you respect your elders, and I'm going to give you the ultimate Uncle Ted Tech Tip.
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.602]  When some devil rapes an innocent person,
[00:04:51.594 --> 00:04:53.355]  I don't need to know their motive.
[00:04:53.635 --> 00:04:55.676]  You don't need to investigate their motive.
[00:04:55.936 --> 00:05:01.459]  You don't need to stress out trying to figure out why would the devil perform evil acts.
[00:05:01.899 --> 00:05:04.440]  Because they're evil.
[00:05:04.781 --> 00:05:06.381]  They already have the power.
[00:05:06.441 --> 00:05:08.002]  They already have all the money.
[00:05:08.242 --> 00:05:09.763]  They already have control.
[00:05:09.983 --> 00:05:13.565]  So it can't be those evil pursuits because they've already got it.
[00:05:14.005 --> 00:05:15.346]  They're just
[00:05:16.026 --> 00:05:22.048]  Rotten to the core and they are filled with hate and control over innocence.
[00:05:22.088 --> 00:05:25.529]  So the bottom line is ignore the seeking of a motive.
[00:05:25.929 --> 00:05:41.393]  Let's just crush them and that's gonna take we the people becoming more and more active kind of like that radical guitar player who has always raised hell because I have a moral spiritual and intellectual obligation to participate in
[00:05:41.713 --> 00:05:44.034]  In this sacred experiment in self-government.
[00:05:44.254 --> 00:05:52.497]  So the battle cry is crush them, hopefully at a voting booth that is actually legal and accurate.
[00:05:52.537 --> 00:05:53.938]  But we're working on these things.
[00:05:53.998 --> 00:05:57.900]  I think what Shemain says and what you say, this is the Great Awakening.
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:03.962]  This is where the middle ground fence-sitters are going, my God, have you seen the price of beef?
[00:06:04.202 --> 00:06:05.583]  Have you seen the price of gas?
[00:06:06.383 --> 00:06:11.126]  Kamala Harris says she hasn't been to Europe when she's asked a question about the border.
[00:06:11.387 --> 00:06:15.770]  They're just evil punks and they must be stopped.
[00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:20.633]  It does seem like a switch has been thrown and they are really taking the mask off.
[00:06:20.653 --> 00:06:24.856]  A few days ago, Biden whispering, going, I sent him the checks in the mail.
[00:06:25.416 --> 00:06:25.957]  I did it.
[00:06:26.017 --> 00:06:28.799]  He sounds like a deranged lunatic, which he is.
[00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:30.860]  And as you said, Kamala thinks that the U.S.
[00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:32.321]  border is Europe.
[00:06:32.701 --> 00:06:34.683]  What the hell planet are these people on?
[00:06:36.536 --> 00:06:37.878]  I've never seen anything like it.
[00:06:38.238 --> 00:06:50.732]  You know, I watched the beatniks turn into the hippies and pursue this disaster known as Comfortably Numb, which now we are experiencing the manifestation of that cultural deprivation, that cultural abandonment.
[00:06:50.972 --> 00:06:51.893]  But I got to tell you,
[00:06:52.828 --> 00:07:13.793]  If you hung out with my great band and my crew and my team and my sons and all our hunting guides at Sunrise Acres, and if you went to the grill with me, if you went to Prime Cuts to get some thick cut bacon with me, Alex, I'm telling you, working hard, playing hard American, they're not just talking about the source of their beautiful organic pork, they're going,
[00:07:14.133 --> 00:07:16.434]  You know, Ted, we got to stop this Gretchen Whitmer.
[00:07:16.734 --> 00:07:18.335]  She really is evil.
[00:07:18.615 --> 00:07:38.863]  These are just mom and pop people who haven't been engaged until recently, and they are speaking like Ted Nugent and Alex Jones because they care, because they're concerned, and they see the horror outcome of these liberals and these Democrats and these Marxists and these terrorists and the terrorists.
[00:07:39.023 --> 00:07:40.103]  How about this, Alex? 2021.
[00:07:42.065 --> 00:07:56.207]  Terrorists like Black Lives Matter, we've seen the footage of their terror, Antifa, which are actually the fascists, and how about the FBI, are now part of that gang.
[00:07:56.747 --> 00:08:04.929]  This is a terrible time, but now the spotlight is wider and brighter, and the cockroaches are scrambling, so now's the time to stomp them.
[00:08:05.389 --> 00:08:10.350]  That's what was so shocking earlier in the week, to see the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
[00:08:12.737 --> 00:08:19.602]  I mean, for those that don't know, I'm sure most viewers do know, he came out and said he wants to know about white rage and that white rage caused the Capitol.
[00:08:19.642 --> 00:08:23.404]  That's a Southern Poverty Law Center line that comes out of the Democrats.
[00:08:23.444 --> 00:08:24.645]  I want to understand white rage.
[00:08:25.065 --> 00:08:25.506]  And I'm white.
[00:08:25.986 --> 00:08:26.947]  And I want to understand it.
[00:08:27.407 --> 00:08:35.732]  So, what is it that caused thousands of people to assault this building and try to overturn the Constitution of the United States of America?
[00:08:35.752 --> 00:08:36.433]  What caused that?
[00:08:37.033 --> 00:08:37.814]  I want to find that out.
[00:08:38.519 --> 00:08:40.121]  None of that had to do with white supremism.
[00:08:40.181 --> 00:08:44.406]  Out of a million people that came to see Trump's speech, 400, 500 got out of hand.
[00:08:44.466 --> 00:08:44.986]  It was wrong.
[00:08:45.367 --> 00:08:46.328]  Nobody endorses it.
[00:08:46.368 --> 00:08:50.472]  Some Antifa and others did dress up like Trump supporters to help initiate that riot.
[00:08:50.733 --> 00:08:52.615]  But you know how dangerous any giant crowd is.
[00:08:52.975 --> 00:08:54.897]  We've never seen a Trump crowd get violent.
[00:08:54.937 --> 00:08:57.300]  They were somewhat angry, a small minority of them.
[00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:08.843]  But the idea that that was white supremacy, and so now critical race theory, a Marxist-Leninist ideology to split up our military and break our country is being taught and promoted by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
[00:09:09.183 --> 00:09:12.724]  I mean, this is disgusting, but like you said now, it's out in the open.
[00:09:12.964 --> 00:09:22.266]  And we have Biden last Monday issuing a new policy paper saying white supremism is the number one threat to America, something that's almost non-existent.
[00:09:22.626 --> 00:09:25.307]  I mean, I know this is something you guys have really been researching.
[00:09:25.587 --> 00:09:26.187]  What's going on?
[00:09:26.838 --> 00:09:32.844]  It's overwhelmingly obvious to so many of us, but we are waking people up.
[00:09:32.904 --> 00:09:37.768]  And if 2020 showed us anything, it's that everything can change in a blink of an eye.
[00:09:38.149 --> 00:09:52.462]  And if we don't wake up even more, if we are not involved in local politics and local school board elections, and when we see something truly say something, and it's so heartwarming to me to see these
[00:09:53.021 --> 00:09:57.181]  Videos of so many mothers and fathers standing up.
[00:09:57.574 --> 00:10:00.675]  For their kids and to stop the insanity.
[00:10:01.276 --> 00:10:03.037]  This is the Great Awakening.
[00:10:03.137 --> 00:10:09.440]  There's no question there's a spiritual war out there right now and it's up to us to stop it.
[00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:17.043]  When the Joint Chiefs of Staff reference a color to rage, that's the definition of racism.
[00:10:17.383 --> 00:10:18.404]  You've got to be kidding me.
[00:10:18.464 --> 00:10:20.585]  I've got children and grandchildren.
[00:10:20.605 --> 00:10:26.508]  We've got neighbors in rural Texas and rural Michigan and downtown Detroit and pretty much everywhere around the country.
[00:10:27.139 --> 00:10:35.543]  Guess what none of my children, none of my grandchildren, none of my friends, none of my neighbors have ever referenced, Alex?
[00:10:36.584 --> 00:10:37.084]  Color!
[00:10:37.913 --> 00:10:40.895]  Nobody's ever cared about color!
[00:10:41.035 --> 00:10:47.179]  All we want to know is content of character, and did you show up on time and do the job to the best of your ability?
[00:10:47.459 --> 00:10:53.983]  I gotta tell you, I'm 72 and a half years old, and being clean and sober, my radar picks up accurate information.
[00:10:54.523 --> 00:11:00.087]  And I gotta tell you, when I see this government and this media constantly referencing
[00:11:00.771 --> 00:11:01.431]  Color!
[00:11:01.952 --> 00:11:03.012]  It's toxic.
[00:11:03.212 --> 00:11:06.353]  It's counter to the America I've grown up in.
[00:11:06.434 --> 00:11:07.594]  Remember, I was born in 1948.
[00:11:07.894 --> 00:11:11.536]  I saw the white drinking fountain and the black drinking fountain.
[00:11:12.096 --> 00:11:14.277]  We fixed that!
[00:11:14.917 --> 00:11:20.059]  A million and a half Americans fought and died to end slavery.
[00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:22.300]  We fixed that!
[00:11:22.701 --> 00:11:25.682]  Now, since Obama, and now with this freak,
[00:11:26.337 --> 00:11:34.943]  This zombie Biden, they're literally fanning the flames of an almost invisible, completely burnt out ember of racism.
[00:11:35.243 --> 00:11:39.966]  It was inconsequential till Obama started fanning those flames.
[00:11:40.586 --> 00:11:46.710]  I'm heartbroken by this because I got friends of every race, every creed, every color, every gender confusion.
[00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:54.175]  I got friends in every category of humankind and we're all tilting our head and squinting our eyes and furrowing our brows going,
[00:11:55.333 --> 00:11:57.095]  Since when is this important?
[00:11:57.515 --> 00:11:58.856]  It's never been important.
[00:11:59.176 --> 00:12:09.285]  They're dividing us and the sheep wearing the masks by themselves in the park are the sheep that are falling for this scam and we're trying to wake them up.
[00:12:10.069 --> 00:12:11.170]  I totally agree.
[00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:15.616]  I mean, you come up being positive and I should be more positive, but I just see all the evil.
[00:12:15.776 --> 00:12:18.239]  I get bummed out sometimes, but you're absolutely right.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.743]  As bad as this is, it's causing the biggest awakening I've ever seen.
[00:12:21.783 --> 00:12:25.408]  I've been interviewing your great husband for at least 20 years and I'm able to talk to you for
[00:12:25.788 --> 00:12:30.912]  Four, five, six, and I've never seen you guys so positive, and I think you're right.
[00:12:30.952 --> 00:12:31.632]  I know you're right.
[00:12:31.972 --> 00:12:36.896]  Some really good things are happening, but the system is trying to counter-strike, trying to divide us.
[00:12:36.976 --> 00:12:39.078]  As Ted just said, how do we counter that?
[00:12:39.098 --> 00:12:50.546]  When you see the school board in Virginia, where they only let the leftists speak for like 30 minutes to trigger the crowd, and the crowd yells, so the police declare unlawful assembly and start beating people up.
[00:12:50.646 --> 00:12:51.727]  I'm not against the police.
[00:12:52.267 --> 00:12:59.633]  I think the police overall are good, but in leftist cities where the police are controlled by the libs, they become tyrannical enforcers of the left.
[00:12:59.913 --> 00:13:05.597]  So I'm really concerned about what we've been seeing around the country where peaceful people try to get up and speak and are being stopped.
[00:13:06.698 --> 00:13:21.470]  Well, first of all, to talk about the positivity, Ted knows I've had many, many sleepless nights and I do a little bit too much research, but I think that's what's really most important is that we all do our own research and these people who are speaking out
[00:13:21.963 --> 00:13:23.264]  And they are being suppressed.
[00:13:23.644 --> 00:13:25.165]  They need to continue to speak out.
[00:13:25.645 --> 00:13:30.527]  They will have their voices heard, but we cannot stop Alex.
[00:13:30.888 --> 00:13:34.870]  We have to encourage people on a local level to get involved.
[00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:36.070]  This is where it starts.
[00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:43.114]  And this is how we awaken so many people because there is a war of good and evil right now.
[00:13:43.534 --> 00:13:47.296]  And there's a demonic presence and there's spiritual warfare going on.
[00:13:47.796 --> 00:13:49.177]  And a lot of people can't see that.
[00:13:49.778 --> 00:13:56.563]  But many of us can and what you and Ted are doing right now and so many other digital soldiers out there.
[00:13:57.444 --> 00:14:01.767]  We are waking people up and I think that's what's really most important to find the thing.
[00:14:01.807 --> 00:14:09.233]  This is what I try to do every day is find the thing that makes your heart sing and do it whether it's going for a walk with your dogs or
[00:14:10.043 --> 00:14:10.984]  Shootin' a bow and arrow!
[00:14:11.004 --> 00:14:12.785]  Shootin' a bow and arrow or play an instrument.
[00:14:12.825 --> 00:14:16.027]  For me, I like to work out and crank up the music that Ted hates.
[00:14:16.147 --> 00:14:16.687]  Sorry, honey.
[00:14:17.387 --> 00:14:20.189]  I love watching you dance to it, I can tell you that.
[00:14:20.469 --> 00:14:22.370]  But you've got to do that.
[00:14:22.431 --> 00:14:25.532]  You've got to get back to the basics and fill your heart.
[00:14:25.552 --> 00:14:28.034]  You know, God gave each and every one of us a gift.
[00:14:28.514 --> 00:14:35.279]  You have the gift of prophecy, and you need to share that, continue to share that, and there are so many others that we need.
[00:14:35.319 --> 00:14:38.981]  It might not be, you know, on a level of what you and Ted have.
[00:14:39.522 --> 00:14:50.289]  We might not all need to do that, but we can help people, we can assist people, we can pray for people, and I think that is the most important thing right now, is that we open our Bibles,
[00:14:51.109 --> 00:14:51.589]  And we pray.
[00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:53.751]  And Alex, let me emphasize that.
[00:14:53.771 --> 00:14:57.153]  You know, a lot of people go, I'm glad you have a format where you can get your voice out there, Ted.
[00:14:57.393 --> 00:14:59.234]  And I go, when was the last time you called your mayor?
[00:14:59.734 --> 00:15:06.058]  When was the last time you told your governor you believe in law and order and defunding the police is cultural suicide?
[00:15:06.079 --> 00:15:06.939]  When did you tell him that?
[00:15:07.179 --> 00:15:08.260]  Well, they'll never listen to me.
[00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:09.761]  You didn't call.
[00:15:10.281 --> 00:15:12.923]  Alex, I want to tell your listeners and your viewers right now.
[00:15:13.769 --> 00:15:20.493]  Each of your individual voice might be more powerful than Alex Jones and Ted Nugent.
[00:15:20.774 --> 00:15:33.842]  Because if your governor and your mayor and your senator and your congressman get calls from concerned, passionate, sincere, believable families going, I don't know why the government claims white supremacy is a problem.
[00:15:34.382 --> 00:15:35.863]  I've never seen it.
[00:15:36.483 --> 00:15:42.047]  I know that all the people killed in Chicago this last weekend, like every day, every weekend,
[00:15:42.802 --> 00:15:45.164]  There was no white supremacy involved.
[00:15:45.505 --> 00:15:46.706]  Why do you keep lying?
[00:15:46.766 --> 00:15:56.516]  Don't let this lie be policy fodder in my state, where you work for me, Mr. Way, or where you work for me, Mr. Governor, where you work for me, Senator and Congressman.
[00:15:56.974 --> 00:16:00.316]  Everybody, your voice is gold.
[00:16:00.917 --> 00:16:07.841]  Call your elected employees and tell them you know that critical race theory is racism.
[00:16:08.202 --> 00:16:15.707]  Tell them you know that if you have general neutrality, that you're being dishonest and you're teaching your children hate.
[00:16:16.307 --> 00:16:17.748]  Call them and tell them that.
[00:16:18.249 --> 00:16:20.130]  Alex, I've said it since the time we met.
[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:32.683]  Worse than Marxism, worse than racism, worse than demonicy is the apathy that rolls out the red carpet and lets that evil continue to perpetuate.
[00:16:32.923 --> 00:16:36.984]  So, don't be an apathetic non-player.
[00:16:37.044 --> 00:16:42.325]  Be an American Hellraiser and call those elected employees and tell them the basics.
[00:16:42.566 --> 00:16:43.586]  Call them once a week.
[00:16:43.666 --> 00:16:45.346]  I'd rather see them call them once a day.
[00:16:45.646 --> 00:16:47.547]  Well, can I insert one thing?
[00:16:48.747 --> 00:17:00.711]  Actually, several things, but the first thing is, you know, Alex, when we had the honor, the privilege to go visit President Trump at the White House in 2017, it was the first time that I had major death threats.
[00:17:01.312 --> 00:17:07.194]  Sarah Palin and I were taking selfies in the Oval Office and it was just an amazing time.
[00:17:07.314 --> 00:17:13.796]  I posted some photos on my social media and I had so much hate and so many death threats.
[00:17:14.232 --> 00:17:21.617]  I cried for a couple of days, but I put on my big girl pants and I started delete, delete, delete, delete, blocking people.
[00:17:21.997 --> 00:17:23.618]  And I realized that, you know what?
[00:17:24.099 --> 00:17:26.680]  And this is something that I've seen Ted go through.
[00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:37.467]  The haters actually inspire him, but it's difficult for a lot of people like me who, you know, we care about what people say, but we cannot anymore.
[00:17:37.928 --> 00:17:42.991]  We have to be aligned with God and with biblical principles, I believe,
[00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:47.271]  And then, you know, if God is for us, who can be against us?
[00:17:48.212 --> 00:17:49.152]  I totally agree with you.
[00:17:49.192 --> 00:17:52.994]  In fact, that was my next question was about President Trump, but we know is the president we know did win.
[00:17:53.594 --> 00:17:56.535]  The evidence is overwhelming, not just in Michigan, but all over the country.
[00:17:56.575 --> 00:18:01.197]  He won by record numbers compared to what he won four years ago, four and a half years ago.
[00:18:01.537 --> 00:18:04.758]  And the idea that we're not supposed to question it, they're now calling that terrorism.
[00:18:05.198 --> 00:18:11.641]  In the new report put out last Monday by Biden, it says officially what they've been saying on the news, that if you question the election,
[00:18:12.441 --> 00:18:13.302]  You're a white supremacist.
[00:18:13.663 --> 00:18:16.266]  That if you don't want to open borders, you're a white supremacist.
[00:18:16.306 --> 00:18:18.489]  If you don't want to turn your guns in, you're a white supremacist.
[00:18:18.509 --> 00:18:19.590]  So that's the new definition.
[00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:20.852]  And if you're a white supremacist...
[00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:22.060]  You're
[00:18:43.875 --> 00:19:01.728]  Very soon, before these rallies start, because the evidence of election fraud is being documented, and so I think we should all really keep our eyes open and our ears, you know, up and listening, because right now the left is losing, but they've set the table to claim that whites are about to massacre a bunch of black people.
[00:19:02.088 --> 00:19:08.772]  So even when that happens, I'm saying, and General Flynn's saying, it has all the earmarks of a false flag, because where's the white supremacism?
[00:19:08.812 --> 00:19:09.752]  Basically doesn't exist.
[00:19:10.212 --> 00:19:11.913]  The black-on-black crime, a terrible thing.
[00:19:11.993 --> 00:19:13.034]  Trump trying to fix that.
[00:19:13.254 --> 00:19:14.435]  It actually went down under Trump.
[00:19:14.735 --> 00:19:15.575]  Now it's exploded.
[00:19:16.095 --> 00:19:30.343]  And so just your concerns, though, as positive as some things are about the sucker punches and what General Flynn and others and myself really see, because I mean, the next card to play would be to stage an event or wind up some crazy.
[00:19:31.601 --> 00:19:32.321]  Well, may I?
[00:19:32.682 --> 00:19:36.163]  You know, a lot of people are really heartbroken before they're angry.
[00:19:36.644 --> 00:19:38.905]  They're very frustrated before they're angry.
[00:19:39.565 --> 00:19:47.329]  Sure, there's a lot of anger out there because we see the abuse of power and the criminal explosion in our own government and the media.
[00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:51.151]  But let me just give you a website, HunterNation.org.
[00:19:51.452 --> 00:19:53.012]  It might sound like it's about hunting.
[00:19:53.373 --> 00:19:57.695]  It's about American families who want policy directed and guided
[00:19:58.195 --> 00:20:06.182]  By God, family, country, Constitution, Bill of Rights, the man in the arena, work ethic, law and order.
[00:20:06.563 --> 00:20:09.645]  Everybody go to HunterNation.org.
[00:20:10.005 --> 00:20:20.755]  We have galvanized a new voting army, and I can show you the numbers, we've talked about this before, but HunterNation.org is a galvanizing center
[00:20:21.388 --> 00:20:36.649]  For families who see the country going against God, against family, against country, against law and order, and I really believe that even though it focuses on the licensed hunters and fishermen and trappers, the real conservationists, the ranchers, the farmers, the outdoorsmen,
[00:20:37.149 --> 00:20:55.234]  That is an army of tens of millions of God family country voters and also learning to call their elected employees and hammering home those traditional family values that make America the destination for people who want an increased quality of life.
[00:20:55.575 --> 00:20:59.236]  Nobody's swimming to Venezuela this week to become free!
[00:20:59.616 --> 00:21:02.777]  So we need to raise more hell and HunterNation.org
[00:21:03.957 --> 00:21:11.760]  Is like the epicenter of people organizing and going to school board meetings going, why are you teaching my children racism?
[00:21:11.981 --> 00:21:14.102]  Why can't I call her, her?
[00:21:15.002 --> 00:21:21.985]  So it sounds simple, and it really is simple, but people need to become activated and go to that website.
[00:21:22.145 --> 00:21:25.547]  It's not just for hunters, it's for people who want to get involved.
[00:21:25.927 --> 00:21:30.929]  And what we're doing there, what we're about to do on Hunter Nation also, is to help people who
[00:21:31.505 --> 00:21:32.626]  Haven't ever hunted.
[00:21:33.186 --> 00:21:41.171]  Learn how to get involved in this hunting lifestyle that we have because there's one thing that we did not worry about last year, Alex.
[00:21:41.612 --> 00:21:44.213]  We never worried about during the lockdown.
[00:21:44.233 --> 00:21:49.156]  And if you've seen that movie Songbird, have you seen that by the way?
[00:21:49.697 --> 00:21:53.039]  No, I haven't, but I'm told it basically predicts what's coming.
[00:21:54.352 --> 00:21:55.913]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:21:56.374 --> 00:21:59.936]  Hunters, we're not going to worry about where our source of food comes from.
[00:21:59.956 --> 00:22:03.119]  And guess what price increase doesn't bother the Nugent family?
[00:22:03.579 --> 00:22:04.220]  Venison!
[00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:05.441]  Beef!
[00:22:05.761 --> 00:22:09.424]  We got venison, we got ducks and pheasant and doves, we got fish.
[00:22:09.464 --> 00:22:12.726]  The grandkids were out fishing and they learned how to scale and skin.
[00:22:12.766 --> 00:22:15.048]  By the way, all your viewers out there at Alex Jones,
[00:22:15.481 --> 00:22:19.084]  Of course you scale the fish, because all the flavors in the skin.
[00:22:19.285 --> 00:22:30.094]  But that self-sufficiency, which is the Nugent family and almost 50 million Americans that learned how to live off the land through the conservation lifestyle, it's catching on more and more.
[00:22:30.114 --> 00:22:33.958]  Do you know, Alex, last year more hunting and fishing licenses were sold
[00:22:34.238 --> 00:22:44.025]  I'm telling you, it's really catching on and people who attacked me for murdering innocent animals are now starting to realize that venison is pure, it's renewable, it's delicious, and it's much more fun to shop for.
[00:22:59.141 --> 00:23:05.429]  Well, I can't, you know, wait to, uh, myself, get out and do some more fishing, some more hunting, because every time I do, it's like a drug.
[00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:06.991]  It's what we're supposed to do.
[00:23:07.112 --> 00:23:08.794]  You know, for me, gardening's the same way.
[00:23:08.814 --> 00:23:13.360]  We're just hiking through the woods, uh, or, you know, playing catch with my dog, just like you guys do.
[00:23:14.301 --> 00:23:22.182]  That's a normal thing to sit around the campfire and talk to other humans and so I'm glad you went where you've gone because CNN is panicking.
[00:23:22.242 --> 00:23:33.605]  I saw an article this week saying record numbers of African Americans are out buying guns and shooting and hunting and they're getting together with white people and Hispanics and what are we going to do?
[00:23:33.685 --> 00:23:39.286]  So they're losing the fight to disarm us intellectually in the hearts and minds.
[00:23:39.326 --> 00:23:41.126]  Of course they're politically and legislatively
[00:23:42.148 --> 00:23:42.528]  Coming up
[00:24:02.833 --> 00:24:07.620]  Promoting and pushing classic Americana in a time when they were demonizing it and attacking it.
[00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:10.064]  You're the original granddaddy of this whole thing.
[00:24:10.104 --> 00:24:12.407]  It's like Chuck Berry's the granddaddy of rock and roll.
[00:24:12.988 --> 00:24:17.935]  And boom, without you doing this, literally holding it all together, we wouldn't be here.
[00:24:18.195 --> 00:24:19.137]  What is it like now?
[00:24:19.437 --> 00:24:22.039]  Shemane to have this incredible husband because it's true.
[00:24:22.079 --> 00:24:23.280]  We should celebrate Ted Nugent.
[00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:24.421]  He's been so demonized.
[00:24:24.441 --> 00:24:29.624]  I mean, I remember being like in the 1980s in high school and hearing Ted Nugent attacked and lies.
[00:24:29.644 --> 00:24:31.966]  I was like, why are they saying bad things about Ted Nugent?
[00:24:32.106 --> 00:24:33.147]  Because I loved his music.
[00:24:33.427 --> 00:24:35.128]  Later, I learned because he was a great guy.
[00:24:35.408 --> 00:24:39.091]  Don't listen to a damn thing you rather say until you see it actually out of their mouth.
[00:24:39.451 --> 00:24:47.437]  But but but literally, what is it like to now see everything you predicted on the bad side coming true, but also the explosion of awakening
[00:24:47.678 --> 00:24:51.639]  Getting back to the earth on the other side, how fulfilling at 72 years of age is that?
[00:24:53.902 --> 00:25:11.646]  Well, it's amazing for me to watch what he's endured and it's been such a learning lesson for me to see that, you know, they attack him because he's not taking their red pill and he's taking God's red pill and he is doing what is right.
[00:25:12.026 --> 00:25:15.087]  He is living clean and sober and they don't like that.
[00:25:15.627 --> 00:25:18.728]  So, the more people that attack him, I just want to put this out there,
[00:25:19.895 --> 00:25:21.076]  That's what makes him high.
[00:25:22.157 --> 00:25:23.098]  He gets high off of that.
[00:25:23.118 --> 00:25:29.224]  But it's a great lesson for me to have watched him go through that and not let any of that bother him.
[00:25:29.264 --> 00:25:38.314]  And he just goes and he takes his bow and arrow and he goes outside and he hunts and he listens to Mother Nature and he lets that cleanse his soul.
[00:25:38.414 --> 00:25:40.416]  And I think it's an important lesson for us all.
[00:25:41.854 --> 00:25:43.696]  So really, I mean, nature is the medicine.
[00:25:43.716 --> 00:25:44.616]  That's how you do it, Ted Nugent.
[00:25:44.636 --> 00:25:50.342]  Because I don't even know about yourself, Ted, but I mean, you've been politically active promoting Americana since the 60s.
[00:25:51.843 --> 00:25:53.664]  Well, you know, you see these bags under my eyes.
[00:25:53.705 --> 00:25:54.685]  Don't be confused.
[00:25:54.725 --> 00:26:00.971]  Number one, I have this new music roaring through my system, and it's kind of difficult to sleep at night.
[00:26:01.011 --> 00:26:02.753]  But these are actually ammo bags.
[00:26:02.813 --> 00:26:03.874]  I have Remington ammo.
[00:26:05.191 --> 00:26:09.493]  So the bottom line is, Alex, I was raised in a family where you had to be accountable.
[00:26:09.533 --> 00:26:19.776]  I was raised in a bowhunting family where each step, if it was taken conscientiously and caringly, each step, this is not just metaphoric, it's actual, literal.
[00:26:20.497 --> 00:26:32.741]  In the woods, if you really perform stealth and a higher level of awareness, which is very difficult for young Ted, because I've always been hyper, that the reward was getting close to the bird, hearing the song,
[00:26:33.613 --> 00:26:36.054]  Seeing the deer that you hadn't intruded yet.
[00:26:36.834 --> 00:26:41.236]  A clumsy step, the punishment was, you never see Jack squat.
[00:26:41.736 --> 00:26:59.763]  So as a bow hunter, that cause and effect was inescapable, and I felt so fulfilled and gratified getting close to wildlife, not during the hunting season to kill them for the dinner table, but just that spiritual connection, the soul-cleansing powers of nature,
[00:27:00.323 --> 00:27:06.806]  It really helped me deal with the intense, incredible energy of my early bands and my current band.
[00:27:06.866 --> 00:27:12.109]  I mean, today, we had more outrageous energy in the studio this week than at any time in my life.
[00:27:12.509 --> 00:27:13.930]  But I knew that I was right.
[00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:20.654]  I knew that the hippies and the beatniks were attacking me for not smoking their dope and murdering innocent animals.
[00:27:20.714 --> 00:27:23.415]  I'm going, murdering innocent animals?
[00:27:24.227 --> 00:27:33.953]  Maybe this dope does make you really stupid, because what does murdering have to do with accepting a gift from God of pure venison for the family?
[00:27:33.993 --> 00:27:41.378]  And they don't understand that if you don't do it, then they'll all basically starve to death and it's just like harvesting wheat or doing anything else.
[00:27:41.418 --> 00:27:43.159]  It's all about good stewardship.
[00:27:43.279 --> 00:27:44.260]  And speaking of that,
[00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:48.163]  Well, here's one glaring example, and I could keep you here for hundreds of hours with examples of this.
[00:27:48.243 --> 00:27:51.726]  In Colorado, they have an overpopulation, a dangerous overpopulation of black bears, just like up in Lake Tahoe.
[00:28:10.475 --> 00:28:17.118]  But the state says you can't hunt them and you can't use the proven methodologies to balance the population of bears every year.
[00:28:17.398 --> 00:28:28.003]  So you can't hunt in the spring, no reason whatsoever except the lies from the animal rights scammers, and you can't use hounds and bait because somebody in Boulder had a bad, you know, acid trip.
[00:28:28.463 --> 00:28:32.865]  And so we can only hunt in the fall and not harvest an adequate number of bears.
[00:28:33.225 --> 00:28:35.486]  So the government takes our tax dollars
[00:28:35.886 --> 00:28:37.807]  Hires U.S.D.A.
[00:28:37.887 --> 00:28:39.387]  hunters, U.S.D.A.
[00:28:39.447 --> 00:28:47.569]  shooters to go in year-round using hounds and bait that we're not allowed to use, slaughtering these magnificent bears.
[00:28:47.869 --> 00:28:48.929]  Nobody gets to eat them.
[00:28:49.149 --> 00:28:56.211]  Nobody buys license or permits or fees or gas or food or lodging or hotels or restaurants or guides or outfitters or taxidermists.
[00:28:56.491 --> 00:29:00.352]  Each bear could generate tens of thousands of dollars to the economy.
[00:29:00.732 --> 00:29:12.420]  While balancing the population, we don't have to pay a million dollars to the sheep farmers and the cattle farmers and the alpaca farmers and the goat farmers to compensate them for all the black bear deprivation.
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:17.223]  So now the black bear is in the liability column instead of the asset column.
[00:29:17.543 --> 00:29:24.888]  And they're still dying, but they're dying after they slaughter livestock, endanger people and even kill people.
[00:29:25.228 --> 00:29:29.071]  That's just one example that exists in every state to some degree.
[00:29:29.411 --> 00:29:33.354]  And so Hunter Nation is going, well, the bear is a magnificent creature.
[00:29:33.714 --> 00:29:36.356]  It should be an asset, not a liability.
[00:29:36.596 --> 00:29:42.720]  You shouldn't pay a guy with a backhoe with your tax dollars to bury this beautiful black bear and waste it.
[00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:45.763]  When it could have been an asset for the entire nation.
[00:29:51.373 --> 00:29:58.960]  They will pay trappers to come in, live trap starving white-tailed deer and then fly them to West Texas at thousands of dollars apiece.
[00:29:59.301 --> 00:30:03.705]  Totally insane when they just get eaten or die in the desert out there.
[00:30:03.985 --> 00:30:05.266]  This is true insanity.
[00:30:05.566 --> 00:30:13.714]  Crazy weird leftist, ban hunting, restrict it, then it overpopulates and then they bring in, you know, giant expensive operations.
[00:30:13.734 --> 00:30:16.136]  I guess that's another example of what's happening with the black bear?
[00:30:17.165 --> 00:30:20.307]  Yes, well, and a variation of that is existing in every state.
[00:30:20.327 --> 00:30:32.754]  Do you know there are still nine states, Alex, where some government goon tells an American citizen, you only have 50% of the hunting season because we won't allow you to hunt on Sundays.
[00:30:33.074 --> 00:30:41.959]  Can you imagine that there's a law in America that forbids a natural conservation freedom activity like hunting
[00:30:42.671 --> 00:30:47.335]  On Sunday, like somehow nature comes to a halt at sunset on Saturday.
[00:30:47.776 --> 00:30:58.025]  And meanwhile, those deer are slaughtered on the highways instead of feeding families, generating gazillions of dollars in family hours of recreation for the economy.
[00:30:58.505 --> 00:30:59.947]  It exists in every state.
[00:31:00.347 --> 00:31:09.496]  So, and by the way, the deer that they attempt to transport because they didn't allow us to harvest them responsibly, do you know that 80% of them die while they're being handled?
[00:31:09.816 --> 00:31:11.498]  Because they're being mishandled!
[00:31:11.718 --> 00:31:15.362]  They're supposed to be killed and grilled, not relocated.
[00:31:15.382 --> 00:31:17.704]  It's literally...
[00:31:18.104 --> 00:31:34.931]  Planet of the cuckoo's nest out there, because the hippies in their comfortable numbness, which is actually uncomfortable numb-nutness, they've literally had influence from an animal rights scam perspective on wildlife managers, especially the Texas Parks and Wildlife in Texas.
[00:31:35.171 --> 00:31:36.912]  They should be ashamed of themselves.
[00:31:37.052 --> 00:31:40.854]  And they can come onto your property without a warrant.
[00:31:42.353 --> 00:31:43.734]  And kill all of your animals.
[00:31:44.054 --> 00:31:44.995]  And it's happened, Alex.
[00:31:45.015 --> 00:31:53.821]  They've literally broke into whitetail breeding operations, slaughtered entire herds, and then go, well, we thought there was a disease, but there wasn't.
[00:31:53.841 --> 00:31:55.763]  But I'm sorry, we ruined your livelihood.
[00:31:56.143 --> 00:31:58.284]  See ya in Texas, Alex.
[00:31:58.565 --> 00:32:00.706]  How dare they do that in Texas?
[00:32:00.806 --> 00:32:06.870]  And the new Bureau of Land Management lady they're trying to approve says she's against hunting and wants to, quote, depopulate humans.
[00:32:06.890 --> 00:32:07.391]  Did you see that?
[00:32:08.345 --> 00:32:10.527]  Yes!
[00:32:10.828 --> 00:32:12.850]  How more demonic can you get?
[00:32:13.971 --> 00:32:15.833]  Alright, well listen, I love you guys.
[00:32:15.873 --> 00:32:16.814]  I appreciate you guys.
[00:32:16.874 --> 00:32:17.735]  I don't want to keep you too long.
[00:32:17.755 --> 00:32:18.996]  I've got to get back in the studio.
[00:32:19.016 --> 00:32:20.277]  I appreciate you coming on the Saturday Show.
[00:32:20.297 --> 00:32:22.480]  But Shemane, you've always got a ton to say.
[00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:23.340]  I love listening to you.
[00:32:23.381 --> 00:32:25.743]  I love watching you as much as your great husband.
[00:32:26.103 --> 00:32:29.207]  What else do you want to say to the audience of viewers and listeners out there about
[00:32:29.687 --> 00:32:33.091]  You know what they can do because I love the fact that you're trying to give people spirits up.
[00:32:33.872 --> 00:32:36.736]  I know you said you heard me a few days ago and I sounded bummed out.
[00:32:37.116 --> 00:32:44.686]  I was and I try to be positive like you guys are and I am sometimes but just any other ways we stay positive any other points you'd like to make.
[00:32:45.694 --> 00:32:47.355]  Well, you know, we all go through that.
[00:32:47.435 --> 00:32:50.218]  I mean, my neck is sore from shaking my head so much.
[00:32:50.298 --> 00:32:54.101]  Every time I turn on the TV or radio, there's so much negative.
[00:32:54.481 --> 00:32:58.785]  But what's really important, Alex, is that, again, we find the thing that makes our heart sing.
[00:32:58.845 --> 00:32:59.986]  God gave us a gift.
[00:33:00.407 --> 00:33:09.774]  Our goal, I think, our mission in life is to share that gift with others and to take time to set aside time to be healthy, to do something healthy for your body.
[00:33:09.794 --> 00:33:11.316]  Because if you don't feel good,
[00:33:12.188 --> 00:33:14.208]  You can't be happy, truly, inside.
[00:33:14.268 --> 00:33:19.529]  So that's most important, but also do not give up.
[00:33:19.849 --> 00:33:28.871]  Now more than ever, we who have been sitting on the sidelines, not you and Ted, but those of us who have been sitting on the sidelines need to stand up.
[00:33:28.971 --> 00:33:33.652]  We need to be bold and brave and let our voices be heard.
[00:33:34.072 --> 00:33:35.792]  I got banned on Twitter.
[00:33:36.032 --> 00:33:41.213]  He's still on Twitter, but I'm banned because I posted a silly video about President Trump.
[00:33:41.893 --> 00:33:47.576]  We lost our First Amendment, they're coming after the Second, and the next thing they're coming after is the Bible.
[00:33:48.057 --> 00:33:54.840]  So, calling all patriots, calling all Christians, now more than ever, get out there and preach, sister.
[00:33:54.901 --> 00:33:56.601]  And I want listeners to understand something.
[00:33:57.082 --> 00:34:00.644]  They may not be Ted Nugent and have tens of millions of followers online,
[00:34:01.204 --> 00:34:09.812]  But it's their videos they shoot on the street or their commentary that whether it gets picked up by 10 people or a thousand or sometimes 10 million, that's the eyes and ears on the street.
[00:34:09.872 --> 00:34:14.717]  So just like Ted said, call Congress, call your mayor, go to city council, go to the school board.
[00:34:15.798 --> 00:34:16.879]  You have to take action.
[00:34:16.959 --> 00:34:18.100]  You really are the power.
[00:34:19.181 --> 00:34:28.109]  When you watch this show, or when you see the archive of it at Band.Video, share it on your email list, share it on your text message, you know, share it with Ted Nugent.
[00:34:28.129 --> 00:34:37.037]  You know, Ted shares these videos, some of them get 300,000 views, they get 5 million views, and just realize that they're suppressing us because the truth is popular.
[00:34:37.057 --> 00:34:41.642]  They wouldn't be suppressing us if we didn't have a very good shot of winning, so listeners and viewers have to know
[00:34:42.042 --> 00:34:44.484]  You're not just half the equation, you're 99% of it.
[00:34:44.544 --> 00:34:50.928]  Because if Ted Nugent was playing his guitar all by himself, you know, in the middle of the forest, God would hear it, it would sound great.
[00:34:51.248 --> 00:34:56.571]  But, you know, it takes people coming to a concert, being there, having that communal event.
[00:34:56.791 --> 00:35:07.658]  Well, just like you need to come to a concert for the communal event, you need to go to the City Council, you need to go to Congress, we need to get back in the streets, peacefully, and let the world know that our numbers are way greater than the left.
[00:35:07.858 --> 00:35:08.859]  They're trying to gaslight us.
[00:35:09.119 --> 00:35:10.100]  They're trying to break our will.
[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:11.401]  They're trying to overwhelm us.
[00:35:11.461 --> 00:35:14.484]  This is signs of weakness, in my view, not signs of strength.
[00:35:14.504 --> 00:35:26.494]  So both of you, take some time, because you've got so many sites, so many great organizations, to let these activist viewers we've got see them and share them, and then tell others that when they share it, please share it again, and then tell those to share it.
[00:35:26.735 --> 00:35:29.257]  And it's that chain reaction that the tyrants fear.
[00:35:29.277 --> 00:35:31.178]  So how do we trigger that chain reaction?
[00:35:31.999 --> 00:35:34.982]  Sixty seconds from each one of you on that, and I'll let you get back to recording studio.
[00:35:36.041 --> 00:35:37.842]  Well, we talk about strength and weakness.
[00:35:37.922 --> 00:35:40.822]  I see a lot of strength out there in reaction to weakness.
[00:35:40.882 --> 00:35:45.564]  We also support a charity called FullCircleProgram.com.
[00:35:46.044 --> 00:35:48.244]  FullCircleProgram.com.
[00:35:48.604 --> 00:35:54.886]  Young Americans helping fellow young Americans during these stressful times where addiction is off the charts.
[00:35:55.346 --> 00:35:57.567]  FullCircleProgram.com.
[00:35:57.887 --> 00:36:00.768]  American youth helping American youth.
[00:36:00.928 --> 00:36:01.968]  A show of strength.
[00:36:02.788 --> 00:36:03.228]  Beautiful.
[00:36:03.769 --> 00:36:05.349]  Shemaine, any other sites people should check out?
[00:36:06.539 --> 00:36:09.523]  Well, I can be followed on social media.
[00:36:10.043 --> 00:36:23.881]  What I do have left on my Facebook and also Instagram and my website is ShemaineNugent.rocks and I have a lot of great programs for women to have supernatural health and to age gracefully.
[00:36:25.367 --> 00:36:26.067]  Well you're amazing.
[00:36:26.207 --> 00:36:27.608]  One little final point I forgot to ask.
[00:36:27.668 --> 00:36:30.190]  Republicans are questioning whether they want Trump again.
[00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:32.091]  That's townhall.com.
[00:36:33.171 --> 00:36:36.793]  Every person that he supports for Congress is winning by record numbers.
[00:36:37.453 --> 00:36:38.694]  The system fears Trump.
[00:36:38.734 --> 00:36:42.436]  We need to keep him as the Republican Party leader even if he doesn't run again.
[00:36:43.416 --> 00:36:51.941]  How do we get folks out there to understand that they have to be heard that we want Trump to continue to be the leader and he needs to hear that or he's going to kind of bow out, I've been told.
[00:36:53.154 --> 00:36:57.558]  Well, again, I say call your mayor, your congressman, your governor.
[00:36:58.238 --> 00:36:59.379]  Go to the school board meeting.
[00:36:59.419 --> 00:37:01.521]  Just blurt out, we support Donald Trump.
[00:37:02.344 --> 00:37:05.765]  We like what Donald Trump did to make America better.
[00:37:06.085 --> 00:37:09.225]  He brought upgrade, quality of life to America.
[00:37:09.746 --> 00:37:15.787]  Joe Biden and his gang of puppets have degraded the quality of life in America on every level.
[00:37:16.027 --> 00:37:26.249]  So just voicing support to your mayor, your senator, your congressman, your governor, just voicing support for Donald Trump is a huge sucker punch to the left.
[00:37:27.089 --> 00:37:27.649]  Absolutely.
[00:37:27.829 --> 00:37:30.270]  All right, guys, thank you so much for your time.
[00:37:30.310 --> 00:37:31.310]  When's the new album coming out?
[00:37:32.475 --> 00:37:36.677]  Well, you know, it's called Ted Nugent Detroit Muscle, and you mentioned campfire.
[00:37:36.697 --> 00:37:38.718]  It's got a song called American Campfire.
[00:37:39.078 --> 00:37:41.339]  Everybody loves the American campfire.
[00:37:41.619 --> 00:37:43.260]  Don't you hear it calling your name?
[00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:46.041]  Everybody loves the American campfire.
[00:37:46.321 --> 00:37:46.901]  Go ahead.
[00:37:47.341 --> 00:37:48.662]  Fan the flames.
[00:37:48.902 --> 00:37:50.703]  Hopefully it'll be out sometime this fall.
[00:37:51.303 --> 00:37:51.543]  All right.
[00:37:51.603 --> 00:37:52.203]  God bless you.
[00:37:52.223 --> 00:37:53.124]  Have a great weekend.
[00:37:54.090 --> 00:37:55.051]  All right, God bless you, Alex.
[00:37:55.091 --> 00:37:55.651]  Godspeed, Alex.
[00:37:55.671 --> 00:37:56.592]  Thanks for everything, man.
[00:37:56.832 --> 00:37:57.513]  Thank you so much.
[00:37:57.573 --> 00:38:00.735]  All right, there goes Ted Nugent and his amazing wife, Shemay Nugent.
