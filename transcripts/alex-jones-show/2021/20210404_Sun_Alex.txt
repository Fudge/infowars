[00:00:05.151 --> 00:00:20.800]  Did you know that thousands of insects and plants have been genetically engineered in the last decade and released in the open air that then go out and breed with the other insects and sterilize them?
[00:00:23.562 --> 00:00:24.122]  Did you know that?
[00:00:26.184 --> 00:00:30.907]  They also created all sorts of other insects like mosquitoes, Bill Gates did.
[00:00:31.991 --> 00:00:32.551]  He funded it.
[00:00:33.372 --> 00:00:42.499]  They go out and breed with other mosquitoes to supposedly make those mosquitoes become sterile and die.
[00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.142]  But really all it did was mutate the mosquitoes and make them much more deadly to humans.
[00:00:47.642 --> 00:00:51.565]  I'm sure that was just a mistake.
[00:00:53.407 --> 00:00:57.289]  Now all this has been tested many times over many years before it's released.
[00:00:57.349 --> 00:00:59.231]  If anything, these globalists are control freaks.
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:07.845]  So here on this Easter Sunday broadcast, we talk about the resurrection of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, something Google won't promote.
[00:01:08.365 --> 00:01:09.967]  Go to Google's front page right now, please.
[00:01:11.808 --> 00:01:17.572]  For any unheard of person or organization or religion or group, they'll put up the Google Doodle.
[00:01:17.952 --> 00:01:23.776]  But nothing on probably the most holy day of the Christian religion.
[00:01:25.277 --> 00:01:26.999]  Billions of Christians worldwide, nothing.
[00:01:28.143 --> 00:01:30.105]  about Christianity on the Google front page.
[00:01:30.125 --> 00:01:33.289]  You just go right to the Google.com front page.
[00:01:35.632 --> 00:01:40.097]  You can see right there, ladies and gentlemen, that there's nothing there.
[00:01:41.839 --> 00:01:47.846]  They put up stuff for Islam, the Buddhists, Satanism, everything in between, but not for Christianity.
[00:01:49.463 --> 00:01:51.284]  Ask yourself, why is that?
[00:01:51.324 --> 00:01:52.965]  Well, they see Christianity as bad.
[00:01:52.985 --> 00:01:54.366]  They see Christianity as the enemy.
[00:01:54.587 --> 00:01:59.830]  They discriminate against Christianity because Google is inherently evil.
[00:02:02.192 --> 00:02:05.454]  And Christianity warns about a worldwide market of the beast.
[00:02:05.494 --> 00:02:09.917]  Christianity warns about a system to buy and sell.
[00:02:09.977 --> 00:02:11.038]  Christianity warns about
[00:02:12.264 --> 00:02:12.984]  What's now unfolding?
[00:02:13.024 --> 00:02:14.605]  Oh, they've bought off most of the churches.
[00:02:15.166 --> 00:02:21.570]  I'm not saying you're going to find Christ in those churches, but I'm talking about what's really in the Bible, what's really unfolding, what's really happening.
[00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.533]  Again, I want to thank you all for joining us on this Sunday, April 4th, 2021 transmission.
[00:02:29.873 --> 00:02:33.997]  And I intend to really lay out incredible information today.
[00:02:34.658 --> 00:02:38.421]  We came in yesterday and shot a special emergency Saturday transmission.
[00:02:38.762 --> 00:02:40.823]  Every show is pretty much an emergency now.
[00:02:41.224 --> 00:02:49.111]  Hell, we're calling this an emergency transmission Sunday broadcast because everybody else is getting shut down, including the real president, Donald John Trump.
[00:02:50.953 --> 00:02:52.334]  And if we don't recognize
[00:02:53.462 --> 00:02:54.784]  That we are in an emergency.
[00:02:54.804 --> 00:03:03.594]  If we don't recognize that we're in a crisis, we'll just keep acting like everything is the way it was before and calmly go into that dark night.
[00:03:05.043 --> 00:03:12.708]  But I'm not going down without a serious cultural, spiritual, historical, financial, and then if they assault us, physical fight.
[00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:21.454]  So I want you to watch the special report we shot yesterday, Emergency Saturday Broadcast, world shocked by SPARS 2025-2028 document.
[00:03:21.474 --> 00:03:22.855]  And it's got close to 700,000 views, and that's great.
[00:03:22.875 --> 00:03:24.756]  It needs a billion views.
[00:03:33.271 --> 00:03:37.092]  In fact, no doubt, if a billion people watch this, our problems would all basically end.
[00:03:37.892 --> 00:03:39.412]  With the current crop of globalists, at least.
[00:03:40.992 --> 00:03:48.534]  You know, I've seen Event 201, and I've seen Operation Northwoods, and I've seen Operation Lockstep, and boy, I've seen a lot.
[00:03:50.674 --> 00:03:53.535]  But when I read SPARS 2025-2028, which is really 2020-2023,
[00:04:01.929 --> 00:04:06.934]  And the exact parallels, the same names of the viruses, everything.
[00:04:07.094 --> 00:04:08.055]  It was amazing.
[00:04:08.335 --> 00:04:11.998]  And, of course, it was the Rockefeller Foundation funding John Hopkins.
[00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:13.120]  It is every time.
[00:04:14.661 --> 00:04:17.704]  You know, again, I had the former head of two major U.S.
[00:04:17.744 --> 00:04:19.606]  intelligence agencies ask me about a month ago,
[00:04:20.902 --> 00:04:23.624]  How did you know all this in a video you did 10 years ago?
[00:04:23.644 --> 00:04:25.845]  And I said, well, I read it on a Rockefeller document.
[00:04:25.865 --> 00:04:27.186]  He goes, well, there's a lot of Rockefeller documents.
[00:04:27.286 --> 00:04:29.047]  I said, well, I know which ones are important.
[00:04:29.088 --> 00:04:31.629]  I know how to tell what's in path with their plan.
[00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.932]  So we're going to lay out that level of breaking knowledge about what's coming next straight ahead.
[00:04:36.312 --> 00:04:37.973]  So hopefully we can stop at this time.
[00:04:39.154 --> 00:04:40.015]  You know, we're intelligent.
[00:04:40.035 --> 00:04:40.575]  We're motivated.
[00:04:40.595 --> 00:04:42.216]  We can stop this, but we've got to wake up.
[00:04:42.236 --> 00:04:44.078]  We've got to realize this is a reality.
[00:04:44.098 --> 00:04:44.438]  Stay with us.
[00:04:57.122 --> 00:05:01.323]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:05:02.024 --> 00:05:03.524]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:05:06.865 --> 00:05:09.146]  Alright, here's a way to think about it.
[00:05:09.366 --> 00:05:11.207]  Here's a way to try to get my point across.
[00:05:11.227 --> 00:05:18.829]  We're on this live Easter transmission, which is only here thanks to your support, your graces, and the good Lord above as well.
[00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:24.531]  Imagine if you learned aliens ran the planet.
[00:05:25.342 --> 00:05:34.405]  And you were suddenly able to read their language and read their text and read their compendium of communication, and you saw how they were controlling you.
[00:05:35.205 --> 00:05:37.285]  You saw how they were manipulating your science.
[00:05:37.806 --> 00:05:49.689]  You saw how they were slowly but surely bending your species and turning you into something else, something ugly, something stupid, something controllable, really just because they were jealous of you.
[00:05:52.008 --> 00:05:54.309]  Well, you might actually do something about that.
[00:05:54.369 --> 00:05:55.570]  You might actually have will.
[00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:59.011]  You might actually want to control your own destiny.
[00:05:59.031 --> 00:06:01.192]  You might actually feel threatened by that.
[00:06:01.212 --> 00:06:05.394]  And it's in the resistance to that that you would find who you are.
[00:06:06.852 --> 00:06:23.246]  But if you don't have a desire to resist that, even in the hypothetical example I just gave, that you don't have consciousness, you are in a sleep state, or maybe you're totally turned over to the spirit and are actually believing in your own destruction because you have some form of self-loathing.
[00:06:26.148 --> 00:06:30.171]  But this is not the fanciful aliens of Hollywood we're talking about.
[00:06:30.612 --> 00:06:31.773]  This is the globalist
[00:06:34.172 --> 00:07:02.521]  That in their own publications, countless publications, like Brave New World Revisited and the statements of Ray Kurzweil and so many others say, we believe humanity has fallen and failed and ugly, because they think that of themselves, and we are going to accelerate mass mutations in the population and massive degradation, and we believe out of that will rise the uber-mention.
[00:07:04.895 --> 00:07:24.649]  And it is true that that which doesn't kill you only makes you stronger, but these people are projecting their own hatred of themselves onto us and then using that excuse that they're trying to save humanity and trying to make us go through this metamorphosis as really just an excuse to carry out their incredibly sadistic activities.
[00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:29.732]  So my broadcast is not here for people that want to live in La La Land.
[00:07:29.752 --> 00:07:32.054]  It's not here for people that just want to
[00:07:33.018 --> 00:07:37.902]  Had the normal political kind of sports-like news where we just battle left-right.
[00:07:38.282 --> 00:07:45.888]  This is about transcendence and a resurrection of the human spirit towards God's will and God's destiny.
[00:07:46.169 --> 00:07:47.470]  But God is free will.
[00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:48.831]  You must choose that.
[00:07:51.053 --> 00:07:52.434]  So let me give you the news flash.
[00:07:52.694 --> 00:07:54.215]  And just here's a quick example of this.
[00:07:56.797 --> 00:07:58.679]  I went on air yesterday for two hours
[00:08:00.683 --> 00:08:02.944]  And posted a key report that's gone viral.
[00:08:03.445 --> 00:08:04.405]  It banned out video.
[00:08:04.905 --> 00:08:06.386]  Emergency Saturday broadcast.
[00:08:06.827 --> 00:08:10.028]  World shocked by SPARS 2025-2028 document.
[00:08:14.151 --> 00:08:21.795]  And in that, I show you a Rockefeller Foundation funded, Bill and Melinda Gates funded, Davos Group, UN funded document.
[00:08:21.835 --> 00:08:22.976]  I show you where they fund it and everything.
[00:08:23.016 --> 00:08:24.677]  Every damn thing I say, I show you.
[00:08:27.499 --> 00:08:28.219]  And in that,
[00:08:32.833 --> 00:08:34.774]  They admit their whole plan.
[00:08:38.155 --> 00:09:02.305]  And so then I thought, when I was doing that show yesterday, I said, let me just mention how the University of Texas down the street from where I'm broadcasting in the ATX, decades ago produced mass production of a genetically engineered fly, already existed, that lays an egg on a fire ant's head, and then its larva goes in and eats the fire ant's brain.
[00:09:04.793 --> 00:09:13.920]  Or let me talk about how they take baby carp and put some chemicals in the water that make them all sterile, then the carp grow up and eat the hydrilla in the water, but don't reproduce.
[00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:24.207]  Or, I just mentioned that, and what was great was that I saw the comments at man.video and Infowars saying, oh my gosh, we hadn't looked all this up.
[00:09:24.868 --> 00:09:28.751]  That's on John Hopkins' website, because now everybody's checking John Hopkins.
[00:09:32.714 --> 00:09:34.435]  And it's Gene Drives.
[00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:40.083]  Pursuing opportunities, minimizing risk.
[00:09:42.204 --> 00:09:53.173]  And so later in the broadcast, I'm gonna cover some of this for you.
[00:09:55.234 --> 00:09:57.236]  Now this is just John Hopkins talking about.
[00:09:59.998 --> 00:10:02.720]  Putting chemicals in the water to sterilize the males.
[00:10:05.902 --> 00:10:08.123]  Releasing biologicals that re-engineer.
[00:10:08.663 --> 00:10:10.984]  They have live viruses that will re-engineer your DNA.
[00:10:13.165 --> 00:10:14.665]  They've got the CRISPR editing systems.
[00:10:14.685 --> 00:10:15.166]  They've got it all.
[00:10:15.546 --> 00:10:18.007]  They can control you now completely.
[00:10:19.727 --> 00:10:25.930]  And the general public sits there like children and says, oh my gosh, Alex Jones is incredible.
[00:10:28.031 --> 00:10:33.653]  How did he know they were putting chemicals in the water to make the frogs gay?
[00:10:36.667 --> 00:10:38.770]  When it's actually going on and they now admit it all.
[00:10:39.751 --> 00:10:42.935]  Because these documents existed 15 years ago and I said that.
[00:10:43.356 --> 00:10:45.178]  They've now just gone completely operational.
[00:10:45.639 --> 00:10:52.829]  And when I said make the frogs, I did that on purpose, knowing they would attack me for it, believing in the future you would find these documents.
[00:10:58.797 --> 00:11:01.899]  But it's like the pinball wizard thing of the Who.
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.281]  It's not like I did it on purpose.
[00:11:04.782 --> 00:11:06.243]  It's more of an idiot savant thing.
[00:11:06.263 --> 00:11:08.585]  I know how to manipulate these people with the truth.
[00:11:08.665 --> 00:11:09.525]  I don't do it with lies.
[00:11:11.407 --> 00:11:13.388]  But now everybody's like, oh Alex Jones is right.
[00:11:13.989 --> 00:11:14.829]  New York Times.
[00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:19.793]  The everyday chemicals that might be leading us to our extinction.
[00:11:23.176 --> 00:11:25.758]  Bill Gates wants to deploy genetically modified mosquitoes.
[00:11:26.923 --> 00:11:31.526]  To inject vaccines and force you to take live nanotech vaccines.
[00:11:32.006 --> 00:11:33.727]  That is a decade-old article.
[00:11:37.449 --> 00:11:38.670]  So, here's what's happening.
[00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:43.693]  I'm just here, on air, covering the whole real world, the way it really works.
[00:11:45.074 --> 00:11:46.715]  The scientists have been recruited.
[00:11:46.775 --> 00:11:47.535]  They're in charge.
[00:11:48.176 --> 00:11:50.397]  They are building a world of post-human.
[00:11:51.820 --> 00:12:08.515]  To do that, they've got to destabilize things, cut resources off, get you to take gene therapy vaccines that sterilize you, and all the numbers coming out showing these new vaccines, gene therapy, reduce fertility, attack placenta, but on top of that, that's not enough to sterilize you.
[00:12:10.416 --> 00:12:17.583]  The studies currently coming out about the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines admit, and I'll show these to you, that it's causing
[00:12:18.823 --> 00:12:24.784]  Protein blooms in the brain similar to prions spongiform encephalopathy.
[00:12:25.424 --> 00:12:30.986]  You have the public nomenclature term is mad cow.
[00:12:32.966 --> 00:12:36.767]  But let's just say convulsing, becoming numb, dying.
[00:12:37.787 --> 00:12:39.047]  It's a protein that eats your brain.
[00:12:42.868 --> 00:12:45.909]  So that's where we are.
[00:12:47.236 --> 00:13:10.106]  And they said in a report four years ago put out by the Rockefeller Foundation with Bill and Melinda Gates through John Hopkins that they would do the mass inoculation to respond to the virus they were going to release from a lab and that then when you took the vaccine six months to a year later it would start eating your brain
[00:13:11.564 --> 00:13:14.205]  And the collapse of civilization will then ensue.
[00:13:14.965 --> 00:13:17.025]  And who is the most vaccinated country in the world?
[00:13:17.526 --> 00:13:18.366]  The United States.
[00:13:18.406 --> 00:13:19.726]  Who's the next most vaccinated?
[00:13:19.846 --> 00:13:27.088]  Europe, which statistically had the ethos of freedom, the highest IQs, and had a chance to hold the planet up.
[00:13:27.468 --> 00:13:30.849]  Instead, they're taking out the brain trust right now.
[00:13:31.369 --> 00:13:37.311]  And then we're all going to have to take care of our families that took the vaccine as they become progressively mentally retarded.
[00:13:39.039 --> 00:13:40.600]  And that will then collapse society.
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:41.681]  We've been hit.
[00:13:42.362 --> 00:13:45.264]  And already, almost half the public's taken the vaccine.
[00:13:46.925 --> 00:13:48.887]  They'll probably get 60% or so to take it.
[00:13:49.767 --> 00:13:51.989]  And we're gonna be taking care of all these folks.
[00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:58.634]  And then again, they even talk about how to manage that in the news, how to control that in the news.
[00:13:59.375 --> 00:14:00.896]  And so people ask, how am I doing?
[00:14:00.936 --> 00:14:01.837]  How am I taking this?
[00:14:01.997 --> 00:14:04.479]  I mean, we're all going down together.
[00:14:04.499 --> 00:14:06.040]  It's like on the Titanic, we're going under.
[00:14:06.801 --> 00:14:07.902]  And I mean,
[00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:11.380]  We just, we're not designed for this high-tech stuff.
[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:14.441]  We're not designed to take on levels that are this sophisticated.
[00:14:14.981 --> 00:14:18.402]  We're not designed to take on treachery this incredible.
[00:14:20.142 --> 00:14:21.702]  The one thing you've got is a memory.
[00:14:22.243 --> 00:14:26.603]  So when you notice like your dad or your mom or your neighbor, like people are dying all around you, which is already happening.
[00:14:27.143 --> 00:14:29.284]  I know a bunch of people already died from the vaccine, myself personally.
[00:14:29.804 --> 00:14:31.244]  And the families are like, well, don't talk about it.
[00:14:31.264 --> 00:14:33.325]  Yeah, they took it and died, but please be private, Alex.
[00:14:33.345 --> 00:14:34.925]  You know, we're not sure this was it, you know.
[00:14:36.033 --> 00:14:38.274]  It's like I'm bad that I know their family member died from it.
[00:14:38.875 --> 00:14:40.576]  So everybody's gonna just kind of be quiet and die.
[00:14:40.696 --> 00:14:41.877]  So it's okay, let's just all die.
[00:14:41.897 --> 00:14:42.757]  It's okay, let's die now.
[00:14:42.797 --> 00:14:59.988]  Time is on my side, yes it is.
[00:15:05.545 --> 00:15:12.490]  All right, so I'm not here on air trying to be negative on Easter.
[00:15:13.891 --> 00:15:21.176]  But everyone is trained to recognize football and Hollywood and all this mainstream stuff.
[00:15:22.957 --> 00:15:29.142]  And so when we say there's a scientific dictatorship carrying out covert manipulation of human evolution,
[00:15:30.776 --> 00:15:36.879]  Towards a post-human world, and I have all their literature, all their admissions, all their status, people go, that's not what I want to hear.
[00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:56.928]  But now you see every institution, from the baseball leagues, to the football leagues, to Hollywood, is just anti-God, anti-family, totally destructive, anti-free speech, anti-regular voting, anti-everything, because this group is evil, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:02.782 --> 00:16:09.487]  So imagine I back in 2010 read Operation Lockstep on air about the beginning of martial law.
[00:16:09.507 --> 00:16:19.714]  Now they would first release a simulant virus, create fear, lock things down, then later release a more deadly virus once we had submitted and been locked down properly.
[00:16:20.354 --> 00:16:24.237]  But they would lock us down, take the lockdown off, then launch a new stronger attack.
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:30.902]  And people saw me talk about that ten years later and they went, oh my god, this guy has a crystal ball.
[00:16:31.342 --> 00:16:32.703]  No, it was in the documents.
[00:16:32.723 --> 00:16:43.469]  Well now, we have a 2017 document, and again, I'll be honest with you, I try to read all these CFR and Trilateral Commission and John Hopkins and Rockefeller documents, but I can't even keep track of them all.
[00:16:47.329 --> 00:16:52.812]  But I'm here reading all this, like SPARS, pandemic, 2028, and it's even worse.
[00:16:52.832 --> 00:16:58.516]  I'll cover it coming up next segment and show you the exact parallels of how it's actually real time.
[00:16:58.536 --> 00:16:59.236]  2025 is actually 2020.
[00:16:59.276 --> 00:17:00.017]  2028 is actually 2023.
[00:17:00.057 --> 00:17:00.857]  And it's all in real time.
[00:17:07.247 --> 00:17:08.208]  But first, let me just do this.
[00:17:08.228 --> 00:17:10.189]  Let me play this clip from 11 years ago, 2010.
[00:17:10.229 --> 00:17:13.331]  Just a few minutes long.
[00:17:13.711 --> 00:17:15.633]  Then I'll play Greg Reese's newest report.
[00:17:15.653 --> 00:17:16.653]  We're about to premiere.
[00:17:17.314 --> 00:17:29.181]  Just dealing with Bill Gates wants control of everything because he's the front man of all the robber baron money, of all the elites that put their money into eugenics to carry this out, which is actually on record historically.
[00:17:30.082 --> 00:17:35.005]  There's Pulitzer Prize winning books about this, that his family runs it, but the average person doesn't read that.
[00:17:35.385 --> 00:17:35.926]  They don't even know.
[00:17:37.455 --> 00:17:39.236]  Or they pretend they're like part of the system.
[00:17:42.037 --> 00:17:42.597]  So here it is.
[00:17:42.637 --> 00:17:45.578]  Here's clip 15 from 11 years ago.
[00:17:47.919 --> 00:17:51.060]  I mean, I'm not even worthy to be bringing you information this powerful.
[00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:55.142]  And I hope that you pay attention to what we cover here minute by minute.
[00:17:56.522 --> 00:17:59.303]  Because I've had chills since last night.
[00:18:00.784 --> 00:18:03.545]  This just confirms everything else we've already researched.
[00:18:05.819 --> 00:18:16.742]  A Rockefeller study envisions future dictatorship controlled by elite, millions being killed, mandatory quarantines, checkpoints, the end of the family, everything that's in the other documents.
[00:18:16.802 --> 00:18:22.844]  But this dovetails with all the other Rockefeller Foundation documents about the GMO food to sterilize you and the forced vaccines.
[00:18:23.564 --> 00:18:29.430]  The hell we're already living in that's just going to continue to intensify until we take our governments back from these eugenics madmen.
[00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:32.173]  But that story is up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:18:32.353 --> 00:18:35.616]  The question is, will you have the courage to really do the research yourself?
[00:18:35.696 --> 00:18:38.879]  Because I don't want you to just sit here and hear me make these claims.
[00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:51.133]  These people are so arrogant that they write policy papers, so many of them, that they're producing these policy papers and reports and white papers so fast that you could never read them all.
[00:18:51.513 --> 00:18:54.557]  It is an open conspiracy against you and your family.
[00:18:54.917 --> 00:18:59.422]  I pray to God, I pray to my Heavenly Father Jesus Christ every night to give me the strength
[00:19:00.243 --> 00:19:11.853]  And the will to be able to face this hard and to give me the strength to carry on because I know why a lot of you don't want to look at this information and just want to comment on the YouTube videos or on message boards that I'm a liar.
[00:19:13.795 --> 00:19:14.175]  I know why.
[00:19:14.775 --> 00:19:15.856]  Because it's scary.
[00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:22.282]  You're not going to be able to go to the ball games anymore.
[00:19:24.724 --> 00:19:27.046]  You're not going to be able to just go out and get drunk with your friends.
[00:19:27.066 --> 00:19:28.027]  You're not going to be able to just
[00:19:29.551 --> 00:19:31.572]  You know, go out and enjoy yourself all the time.
[00:19:32.752 --> 00:19:55.900]  The only chance we've got of beating this scientific dictatorship, this creeping death that takes its time to incrementally enslave you, mentally, psychologically, physically, spiritually, the only way to defeat it is for the rank and file of this planet to realize that you have a choice to make on what your destiny is going to be.
[00:19:57.558 --> 00:20:02.640]  Once you face this information, once you've consciously admitted it to yourself, it will take over your life.
[00:20:03.041 --> 00:20:04.401]  It should take over your life.
[00:20:05.162 --> 00:20:05.962]  I mean, what else?
[00:20:06.582 --> 00:20:08.663]  What else could it do?
[00:20:09.844 --> 00:20:20.129]  We've got to get past the artificial stigma that the controlled corporate media has been putting out for decades, ahead of their open... of unveiling of planetary dictatorship.
[00:20:21.889 --> 00:20:25.231]  They all talk about how we need a police state to carry this out.
[00:20:25.311 --> 00:20:32.996]  Canada and the United States are going to work in lockstep to display the seriousness of our commitment at both home and abroad.
[00:20:33.276 --> 00:20:36.358]  Win, lose, or draw, you need to choose a side.
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:38.960]  InfoWars.
[00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:40.981]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:20:42.202 --> 00:20:44.464]  Alright, so that's from 10 years ago, 11 years ago.
[00:20:44.604 --> 00:20:46.045]  Let me just show you these documents.
[00:20:46.065 --> 00:20:47.946]  We'll come back and play the latest report that just broke.
[00:20:49.858 --> 00:20:52.619]  Florida governor bans COVID-19 vaccine passports.
[00:20:52.679 --> 00:20:54.179]  CNN attacks it, says it's evil.
[00:20:55.059 --> 00:20:56.460]  The vaccine doesn't protect you.
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:58.260]  They admit you got to take 10 shots a year.
[00:20:58.340 --> 00:20:59.060]  It's all a fraud.
[00:20:59.761 --> 00:21:03.622]  Hawaii unveils COVID passports for inter-island travel.
[00:21:03.642 --> 00:21:05.342]  Remember they said, oh, it's a conspiracy theory.
[00:21:05.902 --> 00:21:08.403]  No one's planning it, even though it was in all the documents.
[00:21:08.743 --> 00:21:09.823]  We sent it over a year ago.
[00:21:09.883 --> 00:21:10.424]  It is coming.
[00:21:10.704 --> 00:21:11.724]  They went, no, no, no, no.
[00:21:11.744 --> 00:21:13.064]  So you wouldn't form opposition.
[00:21:13.344 --> 00:21:14.105]  Oh, it's not coming.
[00:21:14.165 --> 00:21:14.805]  Oh, it's not coming.
[00:21:14.845 --> 00:21:15.485]  Well, they got it ready.
[00:21:17.247 --> 00:21:18.287]  You remember, they lied to you.
[00:21:19.047 --> 00:21:22.328]  UK to roll out COVID passports for sporting and music events.
[00:21:22.948 --> 00:21:24.148]  Gotta have the vaccine to go.
[00:21:24.468 --> 00:21:25.569]  All a giant lie.
[00:21:25.869 --> 00:21:27.469]  But always it's gonna be expended.
[00:21:27.509 --> 00:21:28.109]  It's not gonna work.
[00:21:28.149 --> 00:21:29.550]  Gotta get the new shot and pay for it.
[00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:33.630]  Italy mandates COVID-19 shots for all healthcare workers.
[00:21:37.211 --> 00:21:40.532]  The government putting an experimental, unauthorized vaccine in you.
[00:21:42.052 --> 00:21:46.033]  Meanwhile at InfoWars.com, FBI promises to hunt down
[00:21:47.555 --> 00:21:50.637]  Anyone who lies about taking COVIDVax and a vaccine passport.
[00:21:50.657 --> 00:21:53.078]  That's right in the future.
[00:21:53.499 --> 00:21:54.959]  Oh, trying to travel without it.
[00:21:55.059 --> 00:21:55.840]  You're a criminal.
[00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:57.181]  The FBI will get you.
[00:21:57.201 --> 00:21:58.582]  Not all the kids being smuggled in.
[00:21:58.602 --> 00:22:02.244]  Not with Jeffrey Epstein stuff, but you better take your Bill Gates shot.
[00:22:04.625 --> 00:22:05.646]  We have CNN video.
[00:22:05.706 --> 00:22:08.928]  I'll play next segment where she says, hell, cue it up now if we have time.
[00:22:09.841 --> 00:22:14.645]  Where the CNN analyst says, we can't allow freedom, we gotta keep everybody locked down to make them do what we want.
[00:22:14.945 --> 00:22:22.210]  They just admit it all, and she's so proud to be part of the corrupt power structure, she's not even scared to be signed onto such evil.
[00:22:22.671 --> 00:22:23.692]  We'll play it next segment.
[00:22:26.894 --> 00:22:34.580]  China's asking the WHO to hire them to build an international system to maintain flyer data regarding vaccines to cross-border travel.
[00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:35.841]  The World ID, it's already been done.
[00:22:37.688 --> 00:22:39.969]  And that's just a fraction of the articles on that front.
[00:22:39.989 --> 00:22:42.310]  But look at this meme that's gone viral.
[00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:45.231]  It says, the globalist technocracy.
[00:22:47.392 --> 00:22:49.213]  Mark Zuckerberg, I delete your post.
[00:22:49.733 --> 00:22:51.554]  Jeff Bezos, I delete your books.
[00:22:52.654 --> 00:22:56.495]  Susan Wachowski of YouTube, I delete your videos.
[00:22:57.476 --> 00:23:00.297]  Joe Biden, the puppet president, I delete your votes.
[00:23:00.437 --> 00:23:02.578]  And Bill Gates, I delete you.
[00:23:06.192 --> 00:23:10.393]  So when we come back, I'll play the CNN health analyst saying, don't let them have freedom.
[00:23:10.413 --> 00:23:11.253]  Keep them as slaves.
[00:23:11.574 --> 00:23:13.194]  Intimidate them until they do what we say.
[00:23:14.374 --> 00:23:15.215]  Hold them hostage.
[00:23:15.235 --> 00:23:17.315]  I mean, this is like, it's all out in the open now.
[00:23:17.575 --> 00:23:19.016]  They got to emerge at some point.
[00:23:19.076 --> 00:23:19.536]  They're here.
[00:23:20.076 --> 00:23:20.696]  They're here.
[00:23:21.496 --> 00:23:22.117]  They're back.
[00:23:22.497 --> 00:23:23.957]  And then we'll play you the next report.
[00:23:23.997 --> 00:23:24.817]  We haven't premiered yet.
[00:23:24.837 --> 00:23:25.938]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:23:25.958 --> 00:23:26.358]  Stay with us.
[00:23:39.784 --> 00:23:43.347]  Welcome back to this Easter edition of the Live Alex Jones Show.
[00:23:43.487 --> 00:23:45.369]  Sunday, April 4th, 2021.
[00:23:45.509 --> 00:23:49.051]  So here's the final summation.
[00:23:49.091 --> 00:24:03.263]  There is a planetary corporate dictatorship allied with Communist China that is already carrying out a sterilization brain damaging operation
[00:24:04.974 --> 00:24:18.659]  Through gene therapies that are specifically designed to create prion storms, basically protein crystals in your brain to kill you very slowly, very painfully, to weigh down your family and the system and collapses.
[00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:27.322]  And also to attack the same protein in the placenta every time you try to have a child.
[00:24:28.729 --> 00:24:33.672]  And they admit in these John Hopkins documents that as this comes out, that just everything's going to collapse.
[00:24:34.192 --> 00:24:36.093]  That's why China's not really taking the shots.
[00:24:36.213 --> 00:24:36.733]  Others aren't.
[00:24:37.073 --> 00:24:38.594]  It's only the United States and Europe.
[00:24:38.874 --> 00:24:41.896]  For whatever reason, we are slated for total destruction.
[00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:46.631]  And so we're just calmly here just watching the total annihilation.
[00:24:47.352 --> 00:24:48.432]  It's got to be really strong.
[00:24:48.452 --> 00:24:49.553]  They don't want to kill you up front.
[00:24:49.953 --> 00:24:55.236]  But it kills the marvelous Marvin Hagler's, it kills the Hank Aaron's, it almost kills the Ben Stein's.
[00:24:55.256 --> 00:24:58.557]  I mean, I know a bunch of people personally that family die after they take it.
[00:24:58.577 --> 00:24:59.718]  They're like, hey, it's personal.
[00:24:59.898 --> 00:25:00.658]  Yeah, they died.
[00:25:00.758 --> 00:25:01.659]  Don't talk about it.
[00:25:02.019 --> 00:25:04.580]  You know, we're seeing what happened with the doctors.
[00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:06.281]  But yeah, my dad, my mom's dead.
[00:25:07.858 --> 00:25:09.158]  Yes, my brother's dead.
[00:25:09.198 --> 00:25:12.679]  Yeah, he died of a heart attack five hours after he took it, but you know what, Alex?
[00:25:12.759 --> 00:25:15.160]  It's not, uh, well, it's our family.
[00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:16.560]  Well, hey, great, kill yourself.
[00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:16.961]  I love it.
[00:25:17.081 --> 00:25:17.381]  I get it.
[00:25:17.661 --> 00:25:18.841]  Bill Gates says he's killing you.
[00:25:19.081 --> 00:25:19.521]  You love it.
[00:25:19.681 --> 00:25:20.181]  Kill yourself.
[00:25:20.282 --> 00:25:20.502]  Love it.
[00:25:20.662 --> 00:25:21.122]  Let's do it.
[00:25:21.462 --> 00:25:21.722]  Fine.
[00:25:22.082 --> 00:25:22.462]  You love it.
[00:25:22.842 --> 00:25:23.162]  I get it.
[00:25:23.562 --> 00:25:23.983]  Kill the babies.
[00:25:24.003 --> 00:25:24.783]  They're not humans either.
[00:25:24.843 --> 00:25:25.103]  I get it.
[00:25:26.703 --> 00:25:27.323]  So, fine.
[00:25:27.724 --> 00:25:28.524]  Fine, fine, fine.
[00:25:28.544 --> 00:25:28.924]  I understand.
[00:25:30.523 --> 00:25:36.366]  And you're gonna love the checkpoints, and how you gotta always have new shots to travel, and how the authoritarians, and all of it.
[00:25:36.466 --> 00:25:36.887]  I get it.
[00:25:37.287 --> 00:25:40.829]  You don't like freedom, you wanna be destroyed, and you will be.
[00:25:42.995 --> 00:25:45.757]  But I'm here for folks that actually want to hear the truth and be aware.
[00:25:46.057 --> 00:25:50.160]  You know, poor Hank Aaron and others said, it's a small thing to do to protect other people.
[00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:50.720]  They told him that.
[00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:53.482]  But it doesn't protect you from the cold virus.
[00:25:53.662 --> 00:25:55.123]  They now admit the vaccine doesn't work.
[00:25:55.143 --> 00:25:56.704]  That's why you got to take 10 of them a year.
[00:25:56.884 --> 00:25:58.185]  There's always a new variant.
[00:25:58.205 --> 00:25:59.646]  That's why they never did it before.
[00:25:59.866 --> 00:26:05.490]  It's why Merck pulled out of the vaccine and said three months ago, you cannot develop a vaccine for this.
[00:26:05.851 --> 00:26:06.591]  It's a fraud.
[00:26:07.852 --> 00:26:12.115]  But they've created a fraud so big, everybody's a hero and is going to stay in it.
[00:26:14.088 --> 00:26:16.950]  Everybody's gonna, because they can't admit they were wrong.
[00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:18.451]  They wore masks.
[00:26:18.511 --> 00:26:19.452]  They took shots.
[00:26:19.772 --> 00:26:20.833]  You're heroes!
[00:26:21.093 --> 00:26:23.435]  You want to die and you will!
[00:26:24.836 --> 00:26:29.039]  The police want to go shut down churches while the big box stores are open.
[00:26:29.319 --> 00:26:30.560]  It's cool.
[00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:31.541]  You want to die too.
[00:26:31.601 --> 00:26:32.021]  You will.
[00:26:32.061 --> 00:26:32.662]  Don't worry.
[00:26:36.885 --> 00:26:38.106]  It's a spiritual choice.
[00:26:38.166 --> 00:26:39.627]  It's so obvious it's a lie.
[00:26:39.927 --> 00:26:41.168]  It's all based on a fraud.
[00:26:45.885 --> 00:26:50.207]  And the people that are going to die and who are into this, they're already not here anyways.
[00:26:51.387 --> 00:26:52.468]  So it really is a choice.
[00:26:52.548 --> 00:26:53.068]  It's a test.
[00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:59.871]  So I guess I should say thank you, Bill Gates, for getting rid of the bad people.
[00:27:00.491 --> 00:27:01.171]  You know best.
[00:27:02.292 --> 00:27:04.553]  Seriously, Bill Gates is actually cleansing us.
[00:27:05.093 --> 00:27:06.614]  He's our teacher, I'm beginning to learn.
[00:27:07.694 --> 00:27:13.336]  And so is Mark Zuckerberg and Susan Wachowski and Joe Biden, all of them.
[00:27:13.977 --> 00:27:14.777]  They are our teachers.
[00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:17.110]  Thank you.
[00:27:17.651 --> 00:27:18.131]  Thank you.
[00:27:18.651 --> 00:27:19.111]  Thank you.
[00:27:19.632 --> 00:27:20.132]  Thank you.
[00:27:20.692 --> 00:27:21.153]  Thank you.
[00:27:21.973 --> 00:27:23.614]  Wise sages.
[00:27:24.975 --> 00:27:25.735]  Cleanse us.
[00:27:28.357 --> 00:27:30.358]  But oh, here's another wise sage.
[00:27:31.999 --> 00:27:33.480]  Here's another wise sage.
[00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:37.022]  A CNN medical advisor.
[00:27:37.042 --> 00:27:39.743]  On TV.
[00:27:41.725 --> 00:27:42.185]  Telling us.
[00:27:43.561 --> 00:27:54.704]  How great all this is and that we need to have tyranny in place to make sure we all take the experimental shots where they skipped animal testing because it killed so many animals in the testing.
[00:27:54.724 --> 00:27:58.605]  It's actually did the animal testing and everyone's fighting to get the vaccine.
[00:27:58.645 --> 00:28:02.146]  It's the coolest neatest thing gene therapy you can get.
[00:28:02.686 --> 00:28:03.827]  Let's hear from CNN.
[00:28:03.847 --> 00:28:04.247]  Here it is.
[00:28:05.583 --> 00:28:10.646]  My main concern is that we're not going to reach herd immunity because of vaccine hesitancy.
[00:28:10.666 --> 00:28:15.169]  And I know that's hard for a lot of people to believe who desperately want the vaccine right now.
[00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:19.452]  And they're thinking, oh well, it's just a small percentage of people who are actually anti-vaxxers.
[00:28:19.753 --> 00:28:20.273]  And that's true.
[00:28:20.333 --> 00:28:22.895]  There is the anti-science, anti-vaxxer contingent.
[00:28:23.295 --> 00:28:25.977]  But I think that there are many more people, millions of people,
[00:28:26.497 --> 00:28:29.181]  Who, for whatever reason, have concerns about the vaccine.
[00:28:29.201 --> 00:28:31.544]  Who just don't know what's in it for them.
[00:28:31.564 --> 00:28:36.870]  And we need to make it clear to them that the vaccine is the ticket back to pre-pandemic life.
[00:28:37.331 --> 00:28:39.233]  And the window to do that is really narrowing.
[00:28:39.314 --> 00:28:42.317]  I mean, you were mentioning, Chris, about how all these states are reopening.
[00:28:42.598 --> 00:28:43.399]  They're reopening at 100%.
[00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:49.786]  And we have a very narrow window to tie reopening policy to vaccination status.
[00:28:50.126 --> 00:28:53.890]  Because otherwise, if everything is reopened, then what's the carrot going to be?
[00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:56.833]  How are we going to incentivize people to actually get the vaccine?
[00:28:57.153 --> 00:29:00.597]  So that's why I think the CDC and the Biden administration needs to come out on both.
[00:29:04.941 --> 00:29:15.145]  Our commander, and I've got all the stacks saying it, doesn't protect you from COVID, won't protect you, you'll still be locked down once you have it, but it's okay, they're gonna lighten up a little bit before clamping back down.
[00:29:17.406 --> 00:29:27.591]  And we're used to stay in your house, big police horses running women down the streets, police going into churches saying you're non-essential, and we just put up with this orgy
[00:29:30.254 --> 00:29:31.234]  Authoritarianism.
[00:29:31.254 --> 00:29:33.495]  You know, I guess I didn't go to the Bill Gates report yet.
[00:29:34.155 --> 00:29:35.475]  I'll have to get to it next segment.
[00:29:36.435 --> 00:29:37.696]  It's a very, very important report.
[00:29:39.256 --> 00:29:40.857]  Just went live at Band.Video.
[00:29:42.237 --> 00:29:47.698]  Supervillain Bill Gates plans to black out the sun.
[00:29:47.758 --> 00:29:48.998]  That's in his own press releases.
[00:29:49.018 --> 00:29:52.559]  Of course, we told you how they were doing it over 20 years ago.
[00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:56.500]  But now it's all admitted.
[00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:59.301]  You know, I'm gonna try to stay on air as long as I can.
[00:30:02.176 --> 00:30:04.458]  But I've been asked a lot, like, what's it like to be vindicated?
[00:30:04.518 --> 00:30:05.499]  It's sickening.
[00:30:06.359 --> 00:30:08.801]  Because I wish we could have stopped this before we ever got to this point.
[00:30:08.821 --> 00:30:12.044]  It's not about how I've been vindicated.
[00:30:12.064 --> 00:30:16.067]  It's about, this is the admitted globalist plan, and they're carrying this out.
[00:30:16.087 --> 00:30:17.548]  But I'll tell you this for you and your family.
[00:30:17.928 --> 00:30:19.429]  They are going to release more viruses.
[00:30:19.769 --> 00:30:22.752]  They are going to release more weapons that are more serious than this.
[00:30:23.052 --> 00:30:24.133]  The globalists have said this.
[00:30:24.393 --> 00:30:30.758]  Professor says COVID-19 will be like a fond caress in comparison with the next pandemic.
[00:30:32.765 --> 00:30:34.245]  So everybody better get ready.
[00:30:36.566 --> 00:30:38.186]  Everybody better get prepared.
[00:30:39.287 --> 00:30:41.447]  Everybody better get their heads screwed on straight.
[00:30:43.268 --> 00:30:46.709]  Because all of the stuff that happened before is gone now.
[00:30:47.049 --> 00:30:47.929]  Party time's over.
[00:30:48.349 --> 00:30:49.950]  And the globalists are going to make their move.
[00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:51.470]  They're consolidating power.
[00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:53.291]  They're collapsing the first world.
[00:30:53.331 --> 00:30:54.611]  They're collapsing Main Street.
[00:30:55.011 --> 00:30:56.351]  And people aren't doing anything.
[00:30:56.752 --> 00:30:59.352]  And so they're going to take that as a sign to go forward.
[00:31:00.813 --> 00:31:01.773]  It's their very nature.
[00:31:03.297 --> 00:31:08.682]  I would advise listeners to take care of your immune system, protect yourself, protect your family.
[00:31:09.222 --> 00:31:15.828]  A great way to do it is clear water, sunshine, praying to God's improvement in studies to help your overall well-being.
[00:31:16.389 --> 00:31:22.074]  And also, we have a great multivitamin, mineral, liquid system.
[00:31:22.134 --> 00:31:24.036]  It's Vitamineral Fusion with amino acids as well.

[00:32:53.724 --> 00:32:56.266]  All right, I'm going to hit this new Bill Gates news when we come back.
[00:32:56.686 --> 00:32:58.248]  Then I'm going to hit the race war they're pushing.
[00:32:58.888 --> 00:33:08.035]  Russia's foreign minister says they're launching anti-white racism in the U.S., part of a Maoist-backed cultural revolution, which is dead on accurate.
[00:33:08.316 --> 00:33:09.276]  That's coming up as well.
[00:33:09.376 --> 00:33:12.899]  And Charles Barkley knocks it out of the park on the stage racism as well.
[00:33:36.761 --> 00:33:41.524]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Alex Jones, your host on this live Easter transmission.
[00:33:42.324 --> 00:33:43.025]  We're back live.
[00:33:44.906 --> 00:33:48.248]  Okay, so I'm going to explain this again as simply as I can.
[00:33:48.268 --> 00:33:51.110]  And I'm not saying that like you're dumb.
[00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:53.691]  I'm saying just for everybody out there that's tuning in for the first time.
[00:33:55.652 --> 00:33:59.515]  There is a scientific dictatorship that has made decisions about how to run our lives.
[00:34:00.799 --> 00:34:07.743]  That is carrying out an eradication program like they do against fire ants or moths or starfish.
[00:34:08.883 --> 00:34:10.804]  And I've got all the government reports how they do that.
[00:34:11.965 --> 00:34:25.792]  And they even talk in these reports about how we've taken full control of human evolution and reproduction, but we haven't done it yet with all the animals.
[00:34:27.697 --> 00:34:28.617]  And all the plants.
[00:34:29.237 --> 00:34:30.798]  And so now we've got to do it there.
[00:34:31.218 --> 00:34:37.459]  This is John Hopkins, again, Gene Drives, Pursuing Opportunities, Minimizing Risk.
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:40.620]  I spent two hours last night reading this.
[00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:50.042]  And I already knew most of it, but it's just, it's... John Hopkins, for the Rockefeller Foundation that runs the whole thing, is in charge.
[00:34:52.903 --> 00:34:55.284]  And there's literally hundreds of these damn reports.
[00:34:55.344 --> 00:34:56.204]  I mean, I've only read
[00:34:57.366 --> 00:34:58.567]  Dozens of them over the years.
[00:34:59.707 --> 00:35:01.628]  And what they say in these things, they do!
[00:35:02.188 --> 00:35:04.169]  This is more important than bills in Congress!
[00:35:10.032 --> 00:35:20.256]  In 1992, they gave a Pulitzer Prize, not a Pulitzer Prize, a Nobel Prize, to two scientists that were spreading aluminum dioxide, barium salts, and other things out of jets.
[00:35:20.356 --> 00:35:24.218]  They would mix with the jet fuel, and then the jets would release it.
[00:35:24.818 --> 00:35:26.619]  The airlines wouldn't even know what was going on.
[00:35:28.035 --> 00:35:30.477]  And we create this nuclei to then block the sun.
[00:35:31.318 --> 00:35:35.321]  You know that as chemtrails, is the popular nomenclature for that.
[00:35:41.585 --> 00:35:48.731]  Well, Bill Gates is all over every scientific publication admitting that the Department of Energy, since 1994, has been doing this.
[00:35:49.031 --> 00:35:52.794]  And now they've gotten countries to sign on worldwide, tied to the US dollar.
[00:35:54.244 --> 00:36:03.769]  But then you turn on the news, they say it doesn't exist, you're crazy, but I can show you C-SPAN with Clapper and Brennan and others on TV admitting they were doing this.
[00:36:04.290 --> 00:36:05.270]  So it's ongoing.
[00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:12.094]  So here's a report that just went live at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:36:12.154 --> 00:36:13.855]  It's excellent that Gregory's put together.
[00:36:16.296 --> 00:36:19.518]  That is, super villain Bill Gates plans to block out the sun.
[00:36:21.681 --> 00:36:24.284]  And then now because there's so much pressure, he quote, backed off.
[00:36:24.584 --> 00:36:26.366]  That was only the test he was doing in Sweden.
[00:36:26.666 --> 00:36:28.548]  It's already operational.
[00:36:28.908 --> 00:36:35.034]  And then I'm here reading real government documents and friends of mine go, come on, Alex, they're not playing with the atmosphere.
[00:36:37.096 --> 00:36:39.238]  My Lord, this has been declassified for decades.
[00:36:40.519 --> 00:36:43.282]  It's like I talk to the public and it's like talking to children.
[00:36:46.929 --> 00:36:53.050]  And if you don't wake up and if you don't get informed, the globalists have no respect for you.
[00:36:53.071 --> 00:37:00.712]  The only way they have respect for you is if you know about this stuff.
[00:37:00.852 --> 00:37:02.633]  And I'm a regular guy.
[00:37:03.533 --> 00:37:04.973]  And I can read this all day long.
[00:37:05.313 --> 00:37:07.254]  Next hour, I'll hit Spars for you.
[00:37:11.535 --> 00:37:15.596]  But I'm going to tell you, I became physically sick reading this in the last few weeks.
[00:37:18.951 --> 00:37:25.156]  Because when I show you this, you think I want to come into your house and tell you horrible stuff like this?
[00:37:25.676 --> 00:37:26.417]  You think I like this?
[00:37:26.437 --> 00:37:27.898]  You think this is good for me to talk about this?
[00:37:32.742 --> 00:37:35.144]  But it's real and it's all of our futures together.
[00:37:35.224 --> 00:37:38.126]  This, listen, it's not going to move slow anymore.
[00:37:38.146 --> 00:37:39.267]  It's going to move fast now.
[00:37:42.210 --> 00:37:43.451]  It's going to move fast now.
[00:37:46.273 --> 00:37:47.454]  It's not going to move slow anymore.
[00:37:49.349 --> 00:37:50.649]  And so I have three options.
[00:37:52.210 --> 00:38:01.073]  Join the Globalist with hat in hand and wait out the extermination of almost everybody and I'll be killed in the end, I'm sure, but that's just a fool's way out.
[00:38:01.113 --> 00:38:01.593]  I'm not doing it.
[00:38:03.013 --> 00:38:05.034]  Be delusional and just be a regular idiot.
[00:38:10.556 --> 00:38:11.296]  Or fight this thing.
[00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:16.701]  Or I guess there's a fourth way.
[00:38:17.121 --> 00:38:19.402]  Selfishly run off somewhere in the middle of nowhere.
[00:38:20.863 --> 00:38:21.904]  And God is that inviting.
[00:38:23.084 --> 00:38:25.125]  And just pretend like it isn't happening.
[00:38:25.165 --> 00:38:25.646]  But you know what?
[00:38:25.906 --> 00:38:28.167]  I'll be dug out of that hole soon enough.
[00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:33.950]  This is modern warfare.
[00:38:34.451 --> 00:38:36.172]  This is how we're attacked in the future.
[00:38:36.612 --> 00:38:37.612]  This is what happens.
[00:38:38.633 --> 00:38:39.614]  This is the reality.
[00:38:39.914 --> 00:38:42.175]  And I wish to all of you I was wrong.
[00:38:43.075 --> 00:38:43.756]  But I'm not.
[00:38:45.546 --> 00:38:50.529]  And they're arrogant because almost no one will read academic papers.
[00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:53.071]  Almost no one will read white papers.
[00:38:53.712 --> 00:38:56.814]  Almost no one will investigate this.
[00:38:56.934 --> 00:39:01.037]  And because of that, it's like a different language, and we're basically wide open to attack.
[00:39:02.682 --> 00:39:09.586]  If you'll just learn the globalist language, if you'll just learn how they operate, we can then chart a better future together.
[00:39:10.166 --> 00:39:14.068]  And yeah, there's too many people some places, and yeah, there's dumb people, and yeah, we got problems.
[00:39:14.248 --> 00:39:20.472]  We don't set up a world government to kill everybody in the name of that, which then targets the smartest people, which shows that's not even really what they're trying to do.
[00:39:23.153 --> 00:39:25.174]  They are anti-human, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:39:27.075 --> 00:39:28.176]  All right, here's the special report.
[00:39:34.873 --> 00:39:37.875]  No doubt you have realized the splendor of my conception.
[00:39:39.196 --> 00:39:43.360]  First, a necklace of death about the Earth.
[00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:51.606]  50 globes, each releasing its nerve gas over a designated area, each capable of killing 100 million people.
[00:39:53.227 --> 00:39:55.209]  The human race, as you know it.
[00:39:58.688 --> 00:40:07.540]  Who needs a James Bond villain to kill everyone when media darling, eugenicist Bill Gates is off to such a celebrated start?
[00:40:09.542 --> 00:40:18.430]  While earning billions of dollars off his investments in the experimental vaccine industry, Bill Gates claims to be some sort of altruist.
[00:40:19.131 --> 00:40:23.135]  And all of pop culture media support this spurious tale.
[00:40:24.156 --> 00:40:31.102]  But remember when Bill Gates became the world's richest man as a result of ruthless business practices and abuse of powers?
[00:40:32.153 --> 00:40:35.857]  And remember the world's most evil corporation, Monsanto?
[00:40:36.397 --> 00:40:41.242]  Creators of DDT, Agent Orange, and genetically modified foods?
[00:40:41.862 --> 00:40:53.753]  The company working tirelessly to replace all the world's organic seed banks with their own patented GMO varieties so they could one day own the entire world's food supply?
[00:40:54.574 --> 00:41:06.883]  Well, now Monsanto, along with agribusiness giant Cargill, are primarily controlled by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which is also the biggest farmland owner in the U.S.
[00:41:07.963 --> 00:41:15.188]  Bill Gates says, we all must eat GMO food, while aggressively working towards giving us no choice in the matter.
[00:41:16.229 --> 00:41:30.040]  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation sponsored the mRNA vaccines, which are now opening the gates to genetically modified humans, recklessly experimenting on the human genome in hundreds of millions of people.
[00:41:31.801 --> 00:41:39.267]  These experimental gene therapy shots have already killed thousands, but Bill wants everyone to get more.
[00:41:40.948 --> 00:41:44.051]  And now, Bill is preparing to block out the sun,
[00:41:45.222 --> 00:42:04.470]  Bill Gates is working with Harvard's David Keith on a stratospheric solar geoengineering experiment, known as SCOPEX, wherein a kilogram of calcium carbonate particles will be released in the stratosphere to see how viable it will be at reflecting the light from the Sun away from the surface of the Earth.
[00:42:05.330 --> 00:42:13.594]  They claim they want to lower the temperature of the Earth, despite the fact that nobody has any idea what this could do to the overall system of the planet.
[00:42:15.382 --> 00:42:18.064]  Since the beginning of time, man has yearned to destroy the sun.
[00:42:19.065 --> 00:42:20.306]  I will do the next best thing.
[00:42:20.326 --> 00:42:21.928]  Block it out.
[00:42:22.628 --> 00:42:28.413]  In the film, The Matrix, they tried to block out the sun in order to stop the man-made AI threat.
[00:42:29.094 --> 00:42:32.597]  But it ended up enslaving all of mankind in The Matrix.
[00:42:33.597 --> 00:42:42.205]  In the film, Snowpiercer, the world tried blocking out the sun to stop global warming, but ended up triggering a cataclysmic ice age.
[00:42:43.439 --> 00:42:50.061]  And in the dystopian reality that we live in today, Bill Gates wants to save the world by blocking out the sun.
[00:42:50.921 --> 00:42:52.082]  We are told to trust him.
[00:42:52.742 --> 00:43:02.525]  We are told to trust the science, even though the so-called science is wildly theoretical, inconclusive, and universally challenged.
[00:43:03.565 --> 00:43:08.607]  Bill Gates does indeed embody the characteristics of an evil James Bond villain.
[00:43:09.427 --> 00:43:26.592]  But the real villains are obviously the degenerates of world governments and mainstream media who allow this damaged, deranged old man in a pink sweater to play out his father's dreams of depopulation and eugenics on the world stage.
[00:43:27.712 --> 00:43:36.820]  While at the same time protecting the big banks and multinational corporations who are orchestrating this entire war against humanity.
[00:43:37.741 --> 00:43:40.043]  For InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[00:43:57.517 --> 00:44:03.181]  We had some wars between each other before, but still we were humans at the end of the day.
[00:44:03.201 --> 00:44:05.903]  We want to have a future for our wives and children.
[00:44:08.525 --> 00:44:10.086]  But now we're in the future.
[00:44:10.146 --> 00:44:13.728]  We're in the scientific world and there's a group that wants to take control of our destiny.
[00:44:13.988 --> 00:44:15.829]  They've already cracked the code to our genetics.
[00:44:15.850 --> 00:44:18.631]  They know how to create artificial humans.
[00:44:19.772 --> 00:44:22.214]  They don't respect us because we don't stand up for ourselves.
[00:44:24.415 --> 00:44:25.556]  And that's where I get frustrated.
[00:44:25.576 --> 00:44:26.457]  That's where I get upset.
[00:44:27.699 --> 00:44:31.322]  Is that people have to start standing up for the unborn.
[00:44:31.342 --> 00:44:33.143]  We have to start standing up for our very genetics.
[00:44:33.544 --> 00:44:34.945]  We have to start standing up for our species.
[00:44:34.985 --> 00:44:50.137]  And that's why the globalists, while they overturn humanity, while they play God, constantly tell us about our racism and about how bad we are and how we all hate each other, using our tribalism against us before they annihilate us.
[00:44:50.157 --> 00:44:53.500]  I'm going to play Charles Barkley, exposing the divide and conquer paradigm.
[00:44:55.492 --> 00:45:03.318]  On the other side, and it seems like a simple statement, but it's powerful, and it's true, and it's deep, and people aren't going to listen to me, but they may listen to him.
[00:45:04.278 --> 00:45:05.519]  So that's coming up next segment.
[00:45:05.539 --> 00:45:17.308]  And then I'm going to hit the Spars pandemic and the parallels to it and John Hopkins and what they actually launched and how they admit that everything in this is basically what's really happening.
[00:45:19.343 --> 00:45:20.424]  We're only part way into it.
[00:45:20.444 --> 00:45:22.665]  We're about a year and two months into it.
[00:45:22.685 --> 00:45:33.593]  There's another two years left on it and it talks about mass brain damage, mass death from the vaccines and how they're going to try to cover all that up.
[00:45:36.555 --> 00:45:39.698]  So it's pretty sick, as they say.
[00:45:40.999 --> 00:45:44.281]  But I want to hit another report that our crew shot down at the border.
[00:45:44.421 --> 00:45:48.224]  Again, Gregg Reese again, of the massive illegal alien pipeline
[00:45:49.872 --> 00:45:51.052]  That violates federal law.
[00:45:51.332 --> 00:45:53.673]  There isn't even an executive order that can be overturned by the courts.
[00:45:54.213 --> 00:45:55.634]  It's just Biden doing it.
[00:45:55.674 --> 00:45:59.615]  And that just shows you the nature of these individuals.
[00:45:59.635 --> 00:46:01.596]  So we're going to air that report.
[00:46:02.576 --> 00:46:05.517]  We're going to come back and go over this SPARS 2025-2028 report.
[00:46:05.577 --> 00:46:12.159]  We're going to look at how they're trying to create racial division, all this manipulation.
[00:46:12.659 --> 00:46:15.660]  That is all coming up on the other side.
[00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:18.221]  But please, no matter where you're listening or how you're listening, remember,
[00:46:19.383 --> 00:46:21.404]  Your word of mouth is what circumvents big tech.
[00:46:21.484 --> 00:46:26.527]  Your human action against the electronic through the electronic is what wins.
[00:46:27.047 --> 00:46:27.627]  We'll be right back.
[00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:42.836]  The mainstream media has been talking about a surge at the border, but the real story is a massive illegal immigration pipeline run by the Biden administration.
[00:46:43.916 --> 00:46:46.938]  We witnessed it running nonstop in McAllen, Texas.
[00:46:48.513 --> 00:46:56.957]  First, Border Patrol delivers busloads of illegal immigrants to a secured tent processing center on the corner of U.S.
[00:46:57.037 --> 00:46:59.839]  Business 83 and West 15th Street.
[00:47:01.219 --> 00:47:05.962]  We are told by sources well over a thousand each night in this area alone.
[00:47:06.722 --> 00:47:10.684]  And what we witnessed during the day certainly substantiates this number.
[00:47:11.903 --> 00:47:18.448]  We were told by a driver of their operation that they are being tested for COVID-19 at this processing center.
[00:47:20.190 --> 00:47:22.892]  They all leave with manila envelopes in hand.
[00:47:23.893 --> 00:47:38.704]  Those that do test positive for COVID are driven to one of the several hotels who have contracted with the federal government to act as COVID quarantine shelters, where they will quarantine for seven days before being released into the U.S.
[00:47:39.665 --> 00:47:53.168]  And the rest are either bussed or walked down the street to the Humanitarian Respite Center, operated by Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley, where they are brought in through the front door with their manila envelopes inspected.
[00:47:54.028 --> 00:48:01.009]  They are housed, given bags of clothing, and are then sent off through the back door to various U.S.
[00:48:01.049 --> 00:48:03.149]  cities via bus and airplane.
[00:48:03.729 --> 00:48:05.710]  It's a non-stop flowing pipeline.
[00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:20.819]  Those that take the bus are led across the street to the bus station, and the rest are given rides to the airport, where they present Border Patrol and TSA with the paperwork inside their Manila envelopes, and set off to various U.S.
[00:48:20.859 --> 00:48:30.365]  cities, where they are either meeting up with some other government agency, NGO, or perhaps even Mexican cartels operating within the U.S.
[00:48:31.525 --> 00:48:35.308]  It is the biggest illegal immigration smuggling operation in U.S.
[00:48:35.389 --> 00:48:40.893]  history, and it is being run by the federal government on behalf of the United Nations.
[00:49:06.466 --> 00:49:10.409]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:49:10.449 --> 00:49:17.093]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:49:19.715 --> 00:49:29.281]  I saw the news break Friday afternoon, and Saturday, everybody was asking me, Jones, why haven't you covered this?
[00:49:30.442 --> 00:49:32.223]  Well, here we are on Sunday, I'm about to cover it.
[00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:50.906]  And it was Pete Buttigieg, the mayor from wherever, the golden boy, the guy that was never in combat, was a desk jockey, caught posing in combat gear, claiming he was a combat veteran, just like Senator Blumenthal does famously.
[00:49:51.306 --> 00:49:52.526]  He was never even out of the U.S.
[00:49:52.546 --> 00:49:52.927]  Marines.
[00:49:52.967 --> 00:49:57.208]  He ran the Marine Corps toys program for children in D.C.
[00:49:57.668 --> 00:49:58.589]  Never left D.C.
[00:49:58.629 --> 00:50:00.629]  But the point is, these are frauds.
[00:50:01.710 --> 00:50:02.450]  Who thinks like this?
[00:50:04.861 --> 00:50:10.363]  So I saw the footage on Friday, and then I didn't cover it on yesterday's emergency show.
[00:50:10.383 --> 00:50:15.044]  We're here on Sunday, I'm about to cover it, because it's bigger than just him engaged in fraud.
[00:50:15.744 --> 00:50:18.165]  It's about his disrespect for everyone.
[00:50:19.946 --> 00:50:21.426]  So it's a big national story.
[00:50:21.726 --> 00:50:29.689]  Oh, Pete, booty judge, shows up at the White House to discuss gas taxes on everybody.
[00:50:30.009 --> 00:50:31.049]  China isn't going to have that.
[00:50:31.089 --> 00:50:31.749]  We're going to have that.
[00:50:32.110 --> 00:50:33.110]  Anything to shut us down.
[00:50:36.974 --> 00:50:49.759]  Pete Buttigieg, the little chipmunk-like creature, has no credibility, no background, total fraud, caught lying constantly, but he's gay, and it's like, well, then let him run death camps.
[00:50:49.819 --> 00:50:56.082]  I mean, Tim Cook runs the biggest death camps in China, with the Uyghurs, but I mean, he's gay, so it's like, alright, he's gay, it's alright, you know.
[00:50:57.022 --> 00:50:57.763]  Pete Buttigieg.
[00:51:00.144 --> 00:51:00.684]  And so Pete...
[00:51:01.872 --> 00:51:05.195]  Booty Judge is on the tape.
[00:51:05.275 --> 00:51:06.436]  Let's roll it for TV viewers.
[00:51:07.177 --> 00:51:09.379]  And these big armored black SUVs pull over.
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:13.803]  We're talking three blocks from the White House.
[00:51:14.844 --> 00:51:16.986]  And all these men in masks stand around him.
[00:51:18.328 --> 00:51:20.109]  And then he's got his little cool suit on.
[00:51:20.189 --> 00:51:21.070]  He's Wonderboy.
[00:51:21.811 --> 00:51:24.794]  And then he just zooms off and it's all over the news.
[00:51:30.376 --> 00:51:41.382]  And there he is, like the Wicked Witch, shooting down the road to all these photos about, look at him, he is good, he hates the combustion engine.
[00:51:45.204 --> 00:51:49.166]  A cynical, arrogant, hateful move.
[00:51:50.206 --> 00:51:52.627]  Hating his constituents, thinking we're stupid.
[00:51:53.968 --> 00:51:57.430]  And arrogantly thinking, no one's gonna catch me,
[00:52:01.854 --> 00:52:10.805]  Pulling over with all these armored SUVs and even having a ununiformed protector with him like he's that important in the Department of Transportation.
[00:52:11.245 --> 00:52:13.969]  All of them are like imperial Chinese emperors now.
[00:52:15.691 --> 00:52:18.654]  And then all of these SUVs protecting him.
[00:52:20.473 --> 00:52:25.394]  As he rides down the road on his bike and the national news is like, look at him!
[00:52:25.434 --> 00:52:29.675]  He rode 20 miles from his house in Maryland!
[00:52:30.535 --> 00:52:32.456]  He is so good!
[00:52:33.076 --> 00:52:36.036]  And he staged the whole thing.
[00:52:38.077 --> 00:52:43.778]  So I went on Twitter Saturday, yesterday, look at this, and the left was like, big deal, so what?
[00:52:45.458 --> 00:52:48.719]  But again, who would think like that?
[00:52:52.253 --> 00:52:54.354]  Who would behave like that?
[00:52:56.475 --> 00:52:58.456]  Someone who has no real integrity.
[00:52:58.516 --> 00:52:59.416]  Someone who's a predator.
[00:53:00.596 --> 00:53:02.317]  He doesn't have a way of life like yours.
[00:53:02.337 --> 00:53:03.558]  He doesn't have a future like yours.
[00:53:03.938 --> 00:53:04.938]  He doesn't have children.
[00:53:04.978 --> 00:53:06.319]  He doesn't want to have a future with you.
[00:53:06.639 --> 00:53:14.402]  He's a predator, staring out of his godless, empty eyes, figuring out, how can I look good?
[00:53:14.782 --> 00:53:16.443]  How can I manipulate people?
[00:53:20.404 --> 00:53:21.865]  He's a Chinese communist agent.
[00:53:24.650 --> 00:53:25.611]  Just like Joe Biden.
[00:53:27.732 --> 00:53:30.474]  Just like everybody else that serves this system.
[00:53:30.874 --> 00:53:34.376]  They have bowed down to tyranny, and they have no bottom.
[00:53:34.396 --> 00:53:39.219]  You know, I have a lot of news to cover, and I want to get into this big government document.
[00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:40.820]  It's a government-funded document.
[00:53:41.101 --> 00:53:46.084]  This Rockefeller-Rothschild-Bill Gates document, as far as pandemic 2025-2028.
[00:53:46.164 --> 00:53:48.906]  It's the holy grail of understanding the enemy.
[00:53:48.926 --> 00:53:52.388]  But I want to play... I want to play this clip.
[00:53:54.275 --> 00:53:57.096]  I mean, it's like a 15 minute clip, the full things at Infowars.com.
[00:53:57.916 --> 00:53:59.357]  And I want to play a few minutes of it.
[00:54:02.698 --> 00:54:04.059]  This is by Canadian.
[00:54:04.079 --> 00:54:09.961]  Oh, we're going to the Canadian pastor coming up next segment, get in the face of the, of the lockdown and what they were doing as well.
[00:54:14.463 --> 00:54:16.404]  But where's that particular clip I wanted?
[00:54:18.525 --> 00:54:19.025]  You're a genius.
[00:54:19.045 --> 00:54:19.565]  Number seven.
[00:54:20.085 --> 00:54:20.406]  Oh yes.
[00:54:20.906 --> 00:54:23.547]  Advice for people running Biden.
[00:54:24.520 --> 00:54:25.161]  Description.
[00:54:25.241 --> 00:54:25.801]  J.P.
[00:54:25.961 --> 00:54:29.564]  Sears has some words for people running Joe Biden.
[00:54:29.624 --> 00:54:30.465]  This is powerful.
[00:54:31.085 --> 00:54:32.407]  I ran into him on the Hiken Bike Trail.
[00:54:32.427 --> 00:54:33.487]  He actually lives here in Austin.
[00:54:33.748 --> 00:54:34.448]  He escaped L.A.
[00:54:34.468 --> 00:54:35.109]  a long time ago.
[00:54:36.090 --> 00:54:36.930]  But he's scared to have me on.
[00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:37.311]  That's fine.
[00:54:37.331 --> 00:54:38.171]  He's a really smart guy.
[00:54:38.191 --> 00:54:43.836]  And he does it in a properly deferential, groveling fashion, which makes it even more powerful.
[00:54:44.156 --> 00:54:45.397]  I wish I was as slick as him.
[00:54:45.437 --> 00:54:45.778]  Here it is.
[00:54:46.408 --> 00:54:49.872]  This message is for the swell people running President Biden.
[00:54:50.492 --> 00:54:51.033]  Hi guys!
[00:54:51.433 --> 00:54:53.355]  You're doing a phenomenal job.
[00:54:53.576 --> 00:54:55.798]  I mean, things are looking so good.
[00:54:55.838 --> 00:54:57.179]  I mean, he's dominating!
[00:54:57.900 --> 00:54:58.401]  So great.
[00:54:58.881 --> 00:55:01.524]  Which means you guys are doing a great job.
[00:55:01.724 --> 00:55:07.629]  Now after watching his performance at the recent press conference, I'd give him an A. Great job.
[00:55:08.109 --> 00:55:08.750]  So solid.
[00:55:09.230 --> 00:55:17.397]  But I wanted to sit down with you here today and watch the game film and offer you some advice on how he could get to an A plus next time.
[00:55:17.557 --> 00:55:21.521]  So let's see if we can find any areas with room for improvement.
[00:55:21.741 --> 00:55:28.085]  In this clip, you'll see the president openly and honestly expressing his own thoughts from notecards.
[00:55:28.385 --> 00:55:36.550]  We have somewhere, I asked the staff to write it down for me and they did, not for this, but for a longer discussion.
[00:55:37.090 --> 00:55:45.135]  We have somewhere in terms of infrastructure, we have, we rank 13th globally in infrastructure.
[00:55:46.636 --> 00:55:50.418]  Sometimes when someone's just reading off notecards, it makes people wonder,
[00:55:51.699 --> 00:55:53.421]  Why does he have to read off notecards?
[00:55:53.621 --> 00:55:59.867]  But before we get to some advice on this, let's take a look at a clip of Joe answering a question on North Korea.
[00:56:00.187 --> 00:56:10.598]  Let me say that, number one, UN Resolution 1718 was violated by those particular missiles that were tested.
[00:56:11.414 --> 00:56:22.225]  Number one, we're consoling with our allies and partners, and there will be responses if they choose to escalate.
[00:56:24.387 --> 00:56:25.989]  We will respond accordingly.
[00:56:27.165 --> 00:56:39.377]  But I'm also prepared for some form of diplomacy, but it has to be conditioned upon the end result of denuclearization.
[00:56:39.397 --> 00:56:43.441]  So guys, Joe read the entire answer from a note card.
[00:56:44.102 --> 00:56:45.984]  And powerfully so, I might add.
[00:56:46.524 --> 00:56:51.869]  But next time, you might want to have Joe not read off note cards for a couple reasons.
[00:56:52.230 --> 00:57:00.197]  One, having the exact answer to a reporter's question pre-written kind of makes it look like you knew the questions beforehand.
[00:57:00.337 --> 00:57:09.325]  So it kind of looked as if you pre-wrote questions, gave them to friendly reporters to ask Biden, and then Biden read pre-written answers
[00:57:10.186 --> 00:57:10.947]  I don't think so.
[00:57:32.867 --> 00:57:33.908]  He's looking down the whole time.
[00:57:34.448 --> 00:57:41.953]  In normal human communication, looking at someone, possibly even in the eyes, creates a connection.
[00:57:41.973 --> 00:57:43.214]  A note for improvement.
[00:57:43.574 --> 00:57:49.338]  Instead of using note cards and cheat sheets to try to convey the image of a functioning mind, just use a teleprompter.
[00:57:49.458 --> 00:57:51.640]  Now you might be saying, teleprompter?
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:57.564]  Those are for pre-written speeches, not press conferences with unknown questions and off-the-cuff answers.
[00:58:00.751 --> 00:58:04.534]  Why don't we just call this what it is and use a teleprompter?
[00:58:05.314 --> 00:58:07.136]  That's my professional advice.
[00:58:07.416 --> 00:58:09.918]  Oh, and that brings up another area with room for improvement.
[00:58:10.358 --> 00:58:19.685]  At a press conference, when the president's looking out at a sea of reporters calling on someone to ask a question, they usually don't look like this.
[00:58:20.066 --> 00:58:22.968]  Now I'll be happy to take your questions.
[00:58:27.211 --> 00:58:28.352]  Zeke, Associated Press.
[00:58:29.810 --> 00:58:30.251]  Justin.
[00:58:31.392 --> 00:58:35.418]  All totally rigged, all totally staged, and they're all happy to do it.
[00:58:36.299 --> 00:58:40.505]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:58:40.525 --> 00:58:43.248]  So if you just joined us, you saw me read
[00:58:44.488 --> 00:58:59.857]  Ten years ago, we played the clip last hour from a Rockefeller Foundation report, lockstep, about planetary government, masks, lockdowns, global passports, to travel, domestic passports, using the threat of a virus to do it.
[00:59:01.418 --> 00:59:01.958]  Like SARS.
[00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:08.962]  Now, let's look at a document from 2017.
[00:59:14.158 --> 00:59:32.624]  And in that 2017 document, John Hopkins University, that again is the main group that works for Bill and Melinda Gates and the Rockefeller Foundation, develops the SPARS Pandemic 2025-2028 program.
[00:59:32.644 --> 00:59:35.585]  But if you change the dates from 2020 to 2023, it all goes exactly as it's unfolding.
[00:59:43.766 --> 00:59:47.068]  They even use the same names of the viruses, the same names of everything.
[00:59:47.829 --> 00:59:50.190]  They even put out tweets drilling it at the time.
[00:59:50.690 --> 00:59:51.771]  I'm going to show you that right now.
[00:59:52.652 --> 00:59:53.632]  Now, why would they do this?
[00:59:54.833 --> 00:59:57.575]  Well, they've got to get all these agencies and groups involved in a drill.
[00:59:57.595 --> 00:59:58.936]  They're not telling them they're staging it.
[00:59:58.956 --> 01:00:00.136]  They're not telling them they launched it.
[01:00:02.218 --> 01:00:08.702]  And they've got to have this so governments and intelligence agencies that see it think, oh, they're just doing a drill.
[01:00:11.169 --> 01:00:12.510]  And this is done over and over again.
[01:00:12.530 --> 01:00:15.652]  This is one-on-one stuff in intelligence research.
[01:00:17.433 --> 01:00:19.454]  So here it is, the sparse pandemic 2025-2028.
[01:00:19.514 --> 01:00:25.137]  We can put up that first slide there, and I'll just flip to the next one.
[01:00:26.838 --> 01:00:30.140]  Exercise completion date, October 2017.
[01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:34.682]  Before event 201-2019, which is exactly what happened.
[01:00:39.192 --> 01:00:49.899]  And before Crimson Contagion that happened right before that, run by the same groups, same organizations, World Economic Forum, Klaus Schwab, John Hopkins, Bill Gates, all of them.
[01:00:51.420 --> 01:00:52.020]  Let's move on.
[01:00:53.041 --> 01:00:54.281]  Here are the three groups right here.
[01:00:57.003 --> 01:00:58.904]  Next, SPARS 2025-2028.
[01:00:59.565 --> 01:01:04.147]  SPARS originated from Far East, which labeled St.
[01:01:04.247 --> 01:01:06.449]  Paul Acute Respiratory Syndrome.
[01:01:07.739 --> 01:01:11.801]  SPARS COVID-V.
[01:01:15.063 --> 01:01:21.527]  COVID-19 originated from China, originally called China virus or Wuhan SARS COVID-2.
[01:01:21.567 --> 01:01:26.270]  So see they even have almost the same prefixes there.
[01:01:27.551 --> 01:01:28.431]  Here's where it gets crazy.
[01:01:29.712 --> 01:01:30.252]  SPARS 2025-2028.
[01:01:30.272 --> 01:01:30.472]  SPARS
[01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:36.421]  Inflated fatality estimates.
[01:01:36.441 --> 01:01:43.104]  They say in the document that they're going to inflate fatality to 4%, which they then did with COVID, which wasn't true.
[01:01:43.844 --> 01:01:47.686]  Flu fatality rate 14.5, under 64.
[01:01:48.166 --> 01:01:50.427]  Fatality rate 50% over 64.
[01:01:51.387 --> 01:01:55.569]  Actual rate .06, which is what it basically came out to.
[01:01:56.810 --> 01:01:58.190]  This is three years before they launched it.
[01:01:58.491 --> 01:02:00.691]  They'd already pre-planned even the responses.
[01:02:00.712 --> 01:02:01.592]  It's all bold.
[01:02:03.407 --> 01:02:10.893]  COVID-19, inflated fatality estimates, Imperial College, Bill Gates, same people, 2.2 million U.S.
[01:02:10.993 --> 01:02:18.439]  deaths, 510,000 UK, the fatality rate 2%, but they'd estimated as high as a 4%, which is what they put in the document.
[01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:19.941]  This is impossible, folks.
[01:02:20.981 --> 01:02:22.082]  Because none of the numbers are real.
[01:02:22.462 --> 01:02:25.343]  Even our responses in lower numbers are numbers they came up with.
[01:02:25.943 --> 01:02:26.444]  I wonder why.
[01:02:26.484 --> 01:02:30.966]  Why is the New York Times saying 94% of people didn't die of it, only 6%?
[01:02:31.906 --> 01:02:32.907]  They say in here...
[01:02:33.959 --> 01:02:38.642]  Three years before that, 6% only died, 94 didn't die.
[01:02:38.982 --> 01:02:51.170]  They even had the, because they knew we know it was a fraud, so they didn't just have the official number, they then had the fake number, which the news wouldn't say, and then we would put that out, thinking we had countered it, when none of it was true.
[01:02:54.452 --> 01:02:59.035]  You pull up the New York Times headline, only 6% of those listed as COVID deaths died of COVID.
[01:03:00.176 --> 01:03:01.697]  That's in the headlines, New York Times.
[01:03:04.895 --> 01:03:12.479]  And three years before they even release it, four years, five years before where we are now, they have the exact number again.
[01:03:13.199 --> 01:03:13.980]  But it gets crazier.
[01:03:16.021 --> 01:03:19.803]  One listener said it's like getting the Death Star plans, but they call it the Death Spar.
[01:03:20.463 --> 01:03:26.146]  You just change one letter in the name of it, you're like, well, you don't really have the Death Star plans, you have the Death Spar plans.
[01:03:29.908 --> 01:03:30.549]  Spars, 2025, 2028, Spars.
[01:03:34.085 --> 01:03:36.226]  October 2025, SPARS emerges.
[01:03:37.087 --> 01:03:38.247]  January 2026, U.S.
[01:03:39.008 --> 01:03:44.871]  government contracts SYNBIO to produce SPARS vaccine.
[01:03:45.631 --> 01:03:46.231]  Real world.
[01:03:46.251 --> 01:03:47.532]  Again, this is all three years changed.
[01:03:47.572 --> 01:03:50.313]  December 31, 2019, COVID-19 identified.
[01:03:50.794 --> 01:03:52.094]  April 2020, U.S.
[01:03:52.114 --> 01:03:54.916]  government launches Operation War Speed.
[01:03:54.936 --> 01:03:58.918]  They talk about how they're going to speed it all up the same way and get accelerated authorization.
[01:04:01.215 --> 01:04:01.795]  Spars 2025-2028.
[01:04:01.815 --> 01:04:03.937]  Antivirals.
[01:04:03.957 --> 01:04:04.938]  Now this is where it gets crazy.
[01:04:04.958 --> 01:04:06.799]  This is three years before this even started.
[01:04:07.239 --> 01:04:08.340]  Four and a half years before now.
[01:04:09.060 --> 01:04:09.601]  Spars!
[01:04:13.503 --> 01:04:14.384]  Colossevere.
[01:04:15.996 --> 01:04:16.617]  Side effects.
[01:04:16.697 --> 01:04:18.959]  Nausea, headaches, vomiting, and body aches.
[01:04:19.780 --> 01:04:20.540]  COVID-19.
[01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:21.661]  Rendesivir.
[01:04:21.922 --> 01:04:23.403]  They say just was developed.
[01:04:23.823 --> 01:04:25.585]  Just came out last year for this.
[01:04:26.226 --> 01:04:27.307]  Three plus years before.
[01:04:27.867 --> 01:04:28.708]  Colosivir.
[01:04:29.048 --> 01:04:29.889]  Rendesivir.
[01:04:30.229 --> 01:04:30.790]  Nausea.
[01:04:31.050 --> 01:04:31.731]  Constipation.
[01:04:31.771 --> 01:04:32.131]  Vomiting.
[01:04:32.171 --> 01:04:32.491]  Sweating.
[01:04:32.531 --> 01:04:32.892]  Shivering.
[01:04:32.932 --> 01:04:33.552]  Basically the same thing.
[01:04:35.514 --> 01:04:36.775]  Even the same name, folks.
[01:04:37.596 --> 01:04:38.016]  It's worse.
[01:04:38.056 --> 01:04:39.197]  They barely even changed.
[01:04:39.358 --> 01:04:40.679]  They changed two letters coming up.
[01:04:43.965 --> 01:04:46.486]  Massive power outage, they get into predictions of that.
[01:04:47.507 --> 01:05:04.697]  Vaccine propaganda campaign, spars, big tech, celebrities, the president, hip hop stars, MSM, global health expert, that's Bill Gates, John Legrand, Run DMC, Bill Gates, Ryan Reynolds, Dr. Fauci, MSM, Surgeon General, all the same.
[01:05:06.638 --> 01:05:07.778]  Medical countermeasures.
[01:05:08.838 --> 01:05:10.439]  MCM, that's the censorship.
[01:05:11.179 --> 01:05:20.220]  Several sections and appendices are devoted to dealing with public pushback from changing guidelines, viral videos, social media posts, and maintaining trust in government.
[01:05:22.621 --> 01:05:23.981]  Social media countermeasures.
[01:05:24.461 --> 01:05:26.982]  Fourteen, now remember, this was all the real things they said.
[01:05:27.322 --> 01:05:28.822]  This is three years before this even started.
[01:05:29.522 --> 01:05:31.422]  Fourteen days to stop the spread!
[01:05:32.703 --> 01:05:34.523]  Other documents say mask, they don't say mask.
[01:05:35.430 --> 01:05:37.030]  No mask, then yes mask, they say.
[01:05:37.731 --> 01:05:39.431]  Big Tech, because they were following this.
[01:05:39.451 --> 01:05:40.632]  Oh, no, he's like, no, we don't do mask.
[01:05:41.092 --> 01:05:41.812]  Later mask.
[01:05:42.312 --> 01:05:42.492]  See?
[01:05:43.112 --> 01:05:52.175]  Big Tech censorship of doctors, massively platforming, using fact-checking orgs to debunk owned by Big Pharma against government narrative MSM Big Pharma ads.
[01:05:55.708 --> 01:05:58.190]  Because Big Pharma's like, we're not just going to be your main sponsor now.
[01:05:58.310 --> 01:05:59.390]  You've got to help censor.
[01:05:59.711 --> 01:06:01.272]  Vaccine side effects, spars.
[01:06:01.672 --> 01:06:03.893]  Six months side effects begin in adults.
[01:06:04.254 --> 01:06:05.695]  What does Sherry Timpenny doctor say?
[01:06:06.235 --> 01:06:08.336]  Less than two years side effects in children.
[01:06:08.797 --> 01:06:12.299]  Encephalopathy, encephalitis and mental retardation.
[01:06:12.699 --> 01:06:15.661]  Prions, protein growth in the brain.
[01:06:15.962 --> 01:06:20.965]  Now there's mainline medical studies saying it's growing plaques in people's brains.
[01:06:21.325 --> 01:06:25.568]  And if you already have an Alzheimer's plaque in your brain, it's protein growth in the brain.
[01:06:27.409 --> 01:06:28.409]  This accelerates it.
[01:06:30.630 --> 01:06:31.531]  Vaccine effects.
[01:06:32.451 --> 01:06:34.952]  These are real numbers.
[01:06:34.973 --> 01:06:41.015]  50,000 adverse effects, 2,249 deaths, 7,726 serious injuries.
[01:06:41.436 --> 01:06:42.136]  Here it was over 4,000.
[01:06:42.176 --> 01:06:45.538]  You go to the drill, they estimate similar numbers.
[01:06:46.338 --> 01:06:48.019]  Now that's just a boil down.
[01:06:51.613 --> 01:06:52.933]  Of the document itself.
[01:06:53.053 --> 01:06:55.914]  I'm going to show you these quotes from the document when we come back.
[01:06:56.794 --> 01:06:57.975]  I'm going to show you stuff even worse.
[01:06:59.235 --> 01:06:59.435]  Okay?
[01:07:00.135 --> 01:07:01.155]  This is all war-gamed out.
[01:07:01.495 --> 01:07:06.237]  So, everything they said has come true so far in the scenario, that's really the script, the blueprint.
[01:07:07.737 --> 01:07:18.580]  Next, within a few months, you see the mass brain damage, the mass death, and all of it, which they say weighs down society and is good, because it collapses civilization to have a lower carbon footprint, which Klaus Schwab is now already saying.
[01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:20.280]  He says COVID's going to help us get rid of humans.
[01:07:23.305 --> 01:07:25.226]  The planet does have problems.
[01:07:26.166 --> 01:07:27.847]  We've done thousands of nuclear tests.
[01:07:28.667 --> 01:07:29.407]  We've overfished.
[01:07:29.427 --> 01:07:31.688]  We've dumped incredible amounts of toxic waste in the ocean.
[01:07:31.728 --> 01:07:33.488]  We've cut down most of the forests.
[01:07:34.029 --> 01:07:35.609]  But the Earth can regenerate from that.
[01:07:36.269 --> 01:07:41.131]  It can't handle genetic engineering taking it over and these mad scientists playing God.
[01:07:41.231 --> 01:07:45.693]  But they say they're about to call the planet to save the planet.
[01:07:45.713 --> 01:07:49.554]  But really, in their own documents, they admit it's about their mad dash to play God.
[01:07:49.594 --> 01:07:52.535]  And they actually say in their deeper admissions, which are public,
[01:07:52.935 --> 01:07:59.278]  That, oh, we don't even care about the whole planet, we're just using it to metamorphosize into our new God form.
[01:08:01.238 --> 01:08:07.101]  And so my point is, you could argue with them at face level.
[01:08:09.081 --> 01:08:12.903]  Argue with them off of what they claim they're doing, and it's a fraud.
[01:08:14.753 --> 01:08:21.135]  But when you actually study who they are, these people should not be toilet attendants, much less running the whole future of the planet.
[01:08:21.555 --> 01:08:22.595]  And that's what I'm saying.
[01:08:22.655 --> 01:08:34.078]  It's up to those of us that are intelligent, those of us that are successful, those of us that actually have a vision and want to keep humanity in the loop, to stand up and say to the globalists, you are not in control of our destiny.
[01:08:35.358 --> 01:08:38.079]  You need to be in a mental institution, not running the planet.
[01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:41.360]  So,
[01:08:42.981 --> 01:08:48.462]  We came in here and did a two-hour taping yesterday and didn't even cover the surface of it.
[01:08:50.983 --> 01:08:53.704]  But is it really up to me to tell you every damn bit of this?
[01:08:53.784 --> 01:08:55.284]  I mean, you should want to know about this.
[01:08:56.784 --> 01:09:05.586]  If I'm up here reading you documents ten years ago that came true word for word, you don't want to listen to what Alex Jones said, you want to go see what the Rockefeller Foundation or John Hopkins said.
[01:09:07.927 --> 01:09:08.207]  Because
[01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:15.182]  They've been trying to get control of the planet for a long time, and now they're getting that control.
[01:09:17.342 --> 01:09:22.144]  So you go to church and you pray to Jesus because you were brought up to teach that's the higher power and God is real.
[01:09:22.784 --> 01:09:25.365]  But hey, these people are as close as you're going to get to God.
[01:09:26.765 --> 01:09:29.466]  When it comes to running your life, you might want to find out what they're up to.
[01:09:30.066 --> 01:09:37.769]  And you might want to just get on their level, at least at the point of being able to debate them about what they're doing, because they don't even regard you.
[01:09:42.785 --> 01:09:44.206]  Until you talk to them at their level.
[01:09:46.287 --> 01:09:48.108]  And then when you're at their level, they just beg you to join them.
[01:09:49.649 --> 01:09:50.829]  Then they have respect for you.
[01:09:50.849 --> 01:09:57.193]  I don't know why you want their respect, but I'm telling you, they do not respect those of you that wear ignorance like a shield.
[01:09:58.293 --> 01:09:59.274]  Your invincible ignorance.
[01:10:01.975 --> 01:10:09.820]  It invokes them like wolves to sheep, or sharks to blood, or flies to S.H.
[01:10:09.860 --> 01:10:10.360]  you-know-what.
[01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:13.420]  So let's get into it.
[01:10:15.101 --> 01:10:20.283]  Here is the John Hopkins document that we've been mentioning at great length.
[01:10:20.303 --> 01:10:21.243]  You can go read it for yourself.
[01:10:21.363 --> 01:10:23.664]  It's linked on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[01:10:24.205 --> 01:10:28.526]  Here's the 2025-2028 SPARS report.
[01:10:29.967 --> 01:10:33.428]  And even how they're going to respond to you dying of cancer and all the rest of it.
[01:10:33.488 --> 01:10:34.889]  Now they're going to make it a constant lab.
[01:10:35.369 --> 01:10:40.511]  But here are some actual quotes out of the document instead of just the slide I showed you that was also quotes.
[01:10:42.119 --> 01:10:52.162]  After showing no adverse side effects for nearly a year, vaccine recipients slowly begin to experience symptoms of mad cow disease.
[01:10:52.642 --> 01:11:02.104]  Which I then have mainline studies saying, mainline scientists look at this and go, uh, this protein's a mad cow protein, uh, what are you doing?
[01:11:02.324 --> 01:11:03.124]  That's crazy.
[01:11:04.145 --> 01:11:06.965]  Like, chief scientist of Pfizer quit and went public.
[01:11:06.985 --> 01:11:09.506]  I mean, Merck pulled out of this and said, are you nuts?
[01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:13.252]  And again, you're like, well, Gates will go to prison.
[01:11:13.312 --> 01:11:15.915]  No, you get enough people to take the vaccine.
[01:11:15.935 --> 01:11:17.276]  They're not going to say they were wrong.
[01:11:18.097 --> 01:11:21.500]  Most people I've learned when they get brain damage are going to like defend it.
[01:11:22.361 --> 01:11:26.705]  They're not going to because the general public never wants to admit they're wrong.
[01:11:26.765 --> 01:11:28.067]  See, this is psychology.
[01:11:28.087 --> 01:11:30.109]  It's a major gamble by Gates and others, but.
[01:11:31.501 --> 01:11:34.022]  I think unless we stand up to them, they're going to win, actually.
[01:11:34.663 --> 01:11:36.223]  They've almost got half the public vaccinated.
[01:11:36.263 --> 01:11:37.424]  Most other countries aren't taking it.
[01:11:37.784 --> 01:11:38.144]  It's us.
[01:11:38.164 --> 01:11:39.265]  This is to take America out.
[01:11:39.525 --> 01:11:40.705]  We're getting our lobotomy right now.
[01:11:40.725 --> 01:11:43.787]  You think they just put fluoride in the water and Harvard admits it lowers IQ?
[01:11:44.667 --> 01:11:45.747]  No, this is the next level.
[01:11:45.968 --> 01:11:47.268]  This is like, well, fluoride didn't work.
[01:11:48.048 --> 01:11:48.709]  We'll give them this.
[01:11:51.390 --> 01:11:57.753]  As time passed and more people across the United States were vaccinated, claims of adverse side effects began to emerge.
[01:11:58.766 --> 01:11:59.946]  These are quotes from the document.
[01:12:00.807 --> 01:12:10.390]  As the investigators and investigations grew more intense, several high-ranking officials at the CDC and FDA were forced to step down and withdraw from government.
[01:12:10.670 --> 01:12:12.411]  They then admit were going to burn a few puppets.
[01:12:13.011 --> 01:12:21.474]  Nearing the end of 2027, that means 2025, 2023, excuse me, reports of new neurological symptoms began to emerge.
[01:12:22.655 --> 01:12:25.636]  Patients claimed that their children were experiencing neurological symptoms.
[01:12:27.145 --> 01:12:36.981]  That month, a group of parents whose children developed mental retardation as a result of encephalopathy in the wake of the coronavirus vaccination
[01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:39.841]  CoronaVax!
[01:12:40.441 --> 01:12:42.002]  Not the COVID, the Corona.
[01:12:42.562 --> 01:12:43.883]  It was called Corona first.
[01:12:44.324 --> 01:12:46.205]  They said, don't call it Corona, it's too obvious.
[01:12:46.245 --> 01:12:46.785]  Change the name.
[01:12:47.446 --> 01:12:57.512]  CoronaVax vaccination, sued the federal government, demanding removal of the liability shield protecting the pharmaceutical companies responsible for developing and manufacturing CoronaVax.
[01:12:57.572 --> 01:12:58.833]  What are we doing now trying to stop them?
[01:12:59.875 --> 01:13:00.896]  The fact the majority of U.S.
[01:13:00.916 --> 01:13:11.651]  citizens willing to be vaccinated had already been immunized, the negative publicity surrounding adverse reactions had little effect on nationwide vaccination rates because they'd already hit everybody.
[01:13:12.537 --> 01:13:14.179]  You see, and people don't want to admit what happened.
[01:13:14.979 --> 01:13:35.439]  As these cases emerged, pages began filing the compensation under the PREP Act, set up by Reagan, due to lingering uncertainties over possible links between vaccination, reported neurological symptoms, their compensation requests were placed on indefinite hold, pending further data analysis, which will never come because they skipped the trials.
[01:13:37.264 --> 01:13:45.393]  This cohort, many of whom adamantly supported the Coronavax vaccine initially, quickly took to social media to publicize their issues.
[01:13:45.894 --> 01:13:48.837]  That's why they say before we launch it, we must take them all offline.
[01:13:50.238 --> 01:13:52.040]  Today, nearly five years since the St.
[01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:54.703]  Paul acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus,
[01:13:55.595 --> 01:14:01.341]  Made its global debut, there remain human cases in 14 countries across Europe, Africa, and Asia.
[01:14:01.861 --> 01:14:11.150]  As the pandemic tapered off, several influential politicians and agency representatives came under fire for sensationalizing the severity of the event for perceived political gain.
[01:14:11.410 --> 01:14:16.035]  So they say, up front, we're going to exaggerate it, then we'll burn a few millions, but they won't care.
[01:14:16.055 --> 01:14:18.237]  They'll live in Switzerland and $50 million houses.
[01:14:19.500 --> 01:14:33.110]  President Archer's declarations in the Republican Party seized the opportunity to publicly disparage the President and his administration's response to the pandemic, using voters to elect a strong leader with the best interests of the American people at heart.
[01:14:33.130 --> 01:14:39.394]  Archer served as Vice President under President Jacqueline Bennett, these are Democrats, who did not seek a second term due to health concerns.
[01:14:40.075 --> 01:14:40.955]  See, it all mirrors this.
[01:14:41.315 --> 01:14:48.120]  CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice, ACIP, identified the following priority groups for immunization.
[01:14:49.588 --> 01:14:50.109]  We're good to go.
[01:15:07.432 --> 01:15:07.892]  We're good to go.
[01:15:31.428 --> 01:15:42.518]  Furthermore, the cases arose from the initial cohort of vaccine recipients, those in high-risk populations, including those who offer underlying health conditions, making it increasingly difficult to determine the extent to which symptoms were associated with vaccination.
[01:15:43.239 --> 01:15:46.081]  Oh, you shot up the sick people, the old people, to get rid of them first.
[01:15:46.702 --> 01:15:54.589]  So you can't really tell how convenient after-action reports, government hearings, and agency reviews follow the pandemics were too numerous to count.
[01:15:55.600 --> 01:16:03.986]  Several side effects including swollen legs, which is all happening, severe joint pain and encephalopathic brain damage, resulting in seizures and other seizure disorders or death.
[01:16:04.727 --> 01:16:04.807]  Oh!
[01:16:04.827 --> 01:16:17.096]  In an effort to further reach certain population subgroups, agency officials enlisted the help of well-known scientists, celebrities, and government officials to make short videos about the clips online.
[01:16:17.776 --> 01:16:21.859]  It goes into how to counter conspiracy theorists and how to shut down free speech.
[01:16:22.199 --> 01:16:24.461]  We'll tell you about that when we come back.
[01:16:25.649 --> 01:16:41.193]  And so we're about a year into this, there's two more years, and they tell you the brain damage, the mad cow, all of it, and how they're going to cover it up and how you're going to enjoy it, and then they hit you with the next big plug that's even worse, because you learn to stay in your houses while they kill you.
[01:16:41.633 --> 01:16:46.775]  So take your vaccines, wear your mask, especially the left, stay in your houses.
[01:16:47.930 --> 01:16:49.573]  Actually, Bill Gates has given us a favor.
[01:16:49.613 --> 01:16:50.755]  It's the left we're about to kill.
[01:16:51.677 --> 01:16:53.040]  Actually, Bill Gates is good!
[01:16:53.541 --> 01:16:56.266]  Yes, liberals, take your vaccines.
[01:16:56.346 --> 01:16:57.748]  Democrats, take them.
[01:16:58.309 --> 01:16:59.391]  Give them to your children, too.
[01:16:59.411 --> 01:17:00.453]  It's loving.
[01:17:08.929 --> 01:17:12.212]  All right, it's the last segment of the Alex Jones Show on the Sunday edition.
[01:17:14.113 --> 01:17:19.177]  Alex Troyer is about to take over with Sunday Live for two hours of calls, guests, analysis.
[01:17:19.938 --> 01:17:21.979]  And yeah, I'm going to go to the border tomorrow.
[01:17:21.999 --> 01:17:23.540]  I'm going to be driving down there.
[01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:24.221]  It takes five hours.
[01:17:25.042 --> 01:17:33.628]  So I'll be down at the border because it's just too epic to bring the children all living in the dirt under bridges and illegal compounds, not supposed to cover it.
[01:17:34.008 --> 01:17:35.129]  Total blackouts on it.
[01:17:37.611 --> 01:17:38.232]  It's just insane.
[01:17:39.614 --> 01:17:40.854]  So look for all that tomorrow.
[01:17:41.194 --> 01:17:45.635]  James O'Keefe's coming back on the show tomorrow, but Owen Schroer is going to be hosting my regular show.
[01:17:46.095 --> 01:17:50.256]  I'll be calling in from the road, but I've just got to go down there and put eyes on it myself.
[01:17:51.196 --> 01:17:54.397]  I'll also do things, all legal, but my crew won't do.
[01:17:55.077 --> 01:17:57.817]  I don't ask them to do things that I will do.
[01:17:58.297 --> 01:18:05.959]  But let's just say this, you'll want to be tuned in the next few days to InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, and Band.Video.
[01:18:07.034 --> 01:18:11.077]  So here's highlights of the Spars John Hopkins document we've been reading.
[01:18:13.118 --> 01:18:16.541]  Got this whole one over here about putting chemicals in the water to sterilize you and your family.
[01:18:17.782 --> 01:18:18.883]  But here's this one.
[01:18:20.684 --> 01:18:22.905]  And on the last page it gets really interesting here.
[01:18:24.156 --> 01:18:37.920]  It says, conspiracy theorists also proliferate across social media, suggesting that the virus had been purposely created and introduced to the population by drug companies, or it had been escaped from a government lab secretly testing bioweapons.
[01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:50.943]  There was a huge controversy two years before that at Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where Fauci and Gates, you can look it up, were doing gain-of-function SARS-CoV-2 virus gain-of-function testing.
[01:18:52.469 --> 01:18:53.590]  And they moved it to Wuhan.
[01:18:53.630 --> 01:18:54.450]  That was run by them.
[01:18:54.490 --> 01:18:57.351]  That's... The Scientist.
[01:18:57.491 --> 01:18:58.972]  Nature.
[01:18:59.472 --> 01:19:01.073]  Newsweek.
[01:19:01.093 --> 01:19:02.174]  The New York Times.
[01:19:03.054 --> 01:19:06.156]  Even five years ago we still had, or six years ago, some ethics in media.
[01:19:06.176 --> 01:19:07.556]  It was like, all these scientists.
[01:19:07.576 --> 01:19:08.357]  This is dangerous.
[01:19:08.697 --> 01:19:09.657]  This is illegal.
[01:19:09.978 --> 01:19:11.338]  It shouldn't be moved to China.
[01:19:11.999 --> 01:19:14.100]  This is like a known thing they did.
[01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:18.222]  Kind of like UT Stadiums in Central Austin at UT.
[01:19:18.282 --> 01:19:18.562]  It's like...
[01:19:19.721 --> 01:19:22.543]  I mean, it's like New York City's in New York City.
[01:19:22.603 --> 01:19:28.007]  I mean, it's like all hidden in plain view, like we're complete morons.
[01:19:30.950 --> 01:19:37.054]  And they say in here, the conspiracy theorists will say it came out of a lab, knowing they're going to do it, they're going to release it.
[01:19:37.314 --> 01:19:38.055]  Yeah, there's Newsweek.
[01:19:39.116 --> 01:19:41.397]  Dr. Fauci backed controversial Wuhan lab and U.S.
[01:19:41.438 --> 01:19:43.039]  dollars for risky coronavirus research.
[01:19:43.099 --> 01:19:44.520]  I mean, give me a break.
[01:19:44.700 --> 01:19:47.182]  So, here's the deal.
[01:19:47.262 --> 01:19:48.363]  U.S., why would they write all this down?
[01:19:50.964 --> 01:19:54.210]  The most dangerous thing is to have battle plans for your scientists and your people.
[01:19:57.236 --> 01:20:00.418]  Because then, you'll all go to prison for premeditation.
[01:20:00.738 --> 01:20:06.622]  But if you call it a drill, have them drill, then you put a story out, have them follow it, they're not even sure what they're doing.
[01:20:07.022 --> 01:20:13.106]  Though the Davos group's like, hey, it gets rid of carbon footprint, and rid of people, and it's bringing in world government, aren't you glad?
[01:20:13.166 --> 01:20:15.467]  You know, hey, we did it, okay, we did.
[01:20:15.708 --> 01:20:17.909]  You know, they're kind of like, oh, we did, okay.
[01:20:18.449 --> 01:20:22.412]  So, but they don't say it outright, except when Klaus Schwab does.
[01:20:23.490 --> 01:20:25.491]  Because villains have to do a little bit of monologue.
[01:20:25.511 --> 01:20:27.932]  You know, they have to brag how they did it.
[01:20:28.213 --> 01:20:31.414]  When I was a kid growing up, I was like, why does the villain always monologue before they kill somebody?
[01:20:31.434 --> 01:20:33.435]  And then I learned, no, they actually do that.
[01:20:34.316 --> 01:20:38.578]  Whether it's Goldfinger and James Bond, or whether it's Bill Gates in the real world, they monologue.
[01:20:39.639 --> 01:20:41.520]  And they tell you how they did it and why they did it.
[01:20:41.540 --> 01:20:42.860]  It's part of their psychology.
[01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:43.481]  It's part of their M.O.
[01:20:43.561 --> 01:20:46.923]  If I was going to kill somebody, I'd just do it and not tell anybody.
[01:20:47.203 --> 01:20:49.844]  But they, oh, they monologue about it.
[01:20:50.224 --> 01:20:51.185]  They tell you all about it.
[01:20:51.245 --> 01:20:52.926]  It goes on and on.
[01:20:54.889 --> 01:20:55.950]  There's that information.
[01:20:57.351 --> 01:20:58.592]  But here's the good information.
[01:21:00.594 --> 01:21:02.955]  You got CNN saying, don't ever let them be free.
[01:21:04.797 --> 01:21:06.979]  Make them take all the shots before you let them out of your houses.
[01:21:07.059 --> 01:21:07.779]  It's for their own good.
[01:21:10.021 --> 01:21:11.883]  We've got their authoritarianism on parade.
[01:21:12.830 --> 01:21:25.476]  But whether you're in England, or whether you're in Australia, or whether you're in Spain, or whether you're in Canada, where they want to keep the lockdowns in forever, because it just bankrupts all the small businesses, it's thereby a universal income, so you can socially control them, puts the politicians in total control.
[01:21:26.096 --> 01:21:30.718]  They're riding over women with riot horses in England, and they're beating people up everywhere.
[01:21:32.193 --> 01:21:40.340]  But all over Canada, they're arresting pastors after a year of lockdown, saying, oh, the mall's open, but you can't have your little church meeting.
[01:21:41.061 --> 01:21:43.303]  And these preachers are getting in their faces.
[01:21:43.363 --> 01:21:48.228]  It turns out, whether you're in England, or whether you're in Australia, or whether you're in Canada, it's all color of law.
[01:21:48.508 --> 01:21:50.330]  They're charging you under public nuisance.
[01:21:50.590 --> 01:21:52.852]  They don't even have laws saying they can do all this.
[01:21:53.132 --> 01:21:54.093]  This is all illegal!
[01:21:54.333 --> 01:21:59.259]  Contact tracing, these passports, the Chinese rolling out these digital systems.
[01:21:59.539 --> 01:22:07.308]  They just want us to go to certain businesses that demand it so we all get used to it and acquiesce, and then they've got us.
[01:22:08.755 --> 01:22:13.819]  Lifetime tracking where you can't go to a restaurant, get on a bus, travel if you don't have a phone?
[01:22:14.759 --> 01:22:16.561]  This is the holy grail of Big Brother.
[01:22:16.881 --> 01:22:18.202]  It's not coming, it's now here.
[01:22:18.522 --> 01:22:22.805]  And China with the UN is running the global QR score.
[01:22:23.085 --> 01:22:24.046]  They're seeing it and admitting it.
[01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:29.442]  So here's a Polish immigrant, a pastor in Canada, who grew up under communism.
[01:22:30.323 --> 01:22:33.125]  People always overuse the Nazi analogy, but this is definitely right.
[01:22:33.405 --> 01:22:43.892]  With these mass police coming in on Easter and saying you can't, this is this morning, saying you can't have your little church event, and he just says get the hell out of here.
[01:22:44.192 --> 01:22:46.173]  We all have to stop complying.
[01:22:46.453 --> 01:22:48.575]  Governments won't respond to regular crime.
[01:22:49.721 --> 01:22:52.062]  But they will come and tell us we're bad if it's a church.
[01:22:52.242 --> 01:22:55.563]  Because if you mess with a church that's taboo, you can mess with anybody.
[01:22:55.603 --> 01:22:55.964]  Here it is.
[01:22:57.244 --> 01:22:57.904]  Please get out.
[01:22:58.485 --> 01:22:59.445]  Get out of this property.
[01:22:59.645 --> 01:23:00.726]  Immediately get out.
[01:23:01.926 --> 01:23:03.827]  Get out of this property.
[01:23:04.147 --> 01:23:04.707]  Immediately.
[01:23:05.187 --> 01:23:05.308]  Out.
[01:23:05.528 --> 01:23:06.648]  I don't want to hear anything.
[01:23:06.928 --> 01:23:08.009]  Out of this property.
[01:23:08.129 --> 01:23:08.609]  Immediately.
[01:23:08.669 --> 01:23:09.589]  I don't want to hear a word.
[01:23:10.430 --> 01:23:10.650]  Out.
[01:23:11.770 --> 01:23:12.010]  Out.
[01:23:12.951 --> 01:23:14.391]  Out of this property.
[01:23:15.052 --> 01:23:17.633]  Immediately until you come back with a warrant.
[01:23:17.933 --> 01:23:18.053]  Out.
[01:23:19.529 --> 01:23:19.830]  Out!
[01:23:20.851 --> 01:23:21.112]  Out!
[01:23:22.253 --> 01:23:22.494]  Out!
[01:23:23.655 --> 01:23:23.936]  Out!
[01:23:24.777 --> 01:23:26.099]  Out of this property!
[01:23:26.540 --> 01:23:27.641]  Immediately out!
[01:23:28.803 --> 01:23:31.427]  Immediately go out and don't come back!
[01:23:32.455 --> 01:23:33.456]  I don't want to talk to you!
[01:23:33.936 --> 01:23:34.517]  Not a word!
[01:23:34.837 --> 01:23:35.618]  Out of this property!
[01:23:36.178 --> 01:23:37.499]  Out of this property!
[01:23:37.580 --> 01:23:38.600]  Immediately out!
[01:23:39.501 --> 01:23:41.683]  I don't care what you have to say!
[01:23:42.424 --> 01:23:42.664]  Out!
[01:23:43.665 --> 01:23:43.925]  Out!
[01:23:44.766 --> 01:23:46.787]  Out of this property, you Nazis!
[01:23:47.508 --> 01:23:47.708]  Out!
[01:23:48.809 --> 01:23:49.049]  Out!
[01:23:49.990 --> 01:23:51.872]  Gestapo is not allowed here!
[01:23:52.873 --> 01:23:56.976]  Immediately, Gestapo is not allowed!
[01:23:58.437 --> 01:23:58.618]  Out!
[01:24:00.213 --> 01:24:01.555]  Do you understand English?
[01:24:01.996 --> 01:24:03.819]  Get out of this property!
[01:24:04.727 --> 01:24:04.947]  Go!
[01:24:05.548 --> 01:24:05.928]  So go!
[01:24:06.408 --> 01:24:06.689]  Go!
[01:24:07.389 --> 01:24:08.870]  And don't come back without a warrant!
[01:24:09.351 --> 01:24:10.031]  Out, Nazi!
[01:24:10.712 --> 01:24:10.952]  Out!
[01:24:11.292 --> 01:24:12.133]  Then he runs them out.
[01:24:12.153 --> 01:24:14.214]  We got his videos of him being interviewed outside.
[01:24:14.595 --> 01:24:16.596]  And let me tell you, they are just out of control in Canada.
[01:24:16.656 --> 01:24:17.457]  It's so shameful.
[01:24:17.737 --> 01:24:19.479]  They use how nice the people are to do this.
[01:24:19.939 --> 01:24:22.361]  The average cops aren't part of this, but they've got to be told, though.
[01:24:22.681 --> 01:24:23.422]  It's the bureaucrats.
[01:24:23.502 --> 01:24:28.606]  It's the dictator who stole his election, Trudeau, who says he follows Mao Zedong.
[01:24:29.166 --> 01:24:31.568]  He says, I follow Mao Zedong and dictatorship.
[01:24:31.948 --> 01:24:33.830]  I want to be a dictatorship like Mao Zedong.
[01:24:34.150 --> 01:24:36.291]  If you're a new listener, I'm not, don't have time to play it.
[01:24:36.651 --> 01:24:37.291]  I'm not lying.
[01:24:37.671 --> 01:24:38.671]  I know it sounds insane.
[01:24:39.012 --> 01:24:41.772]  Mouse, he says, I love China.
[01:24:41.832 --> 01:24:42.773]  I love their dictatorship.
[01:24:43.093 --> 01:24:46.014]  Just type in Justin Trudeau loves Chinese dictatorship.
[01:24:46.034 --> 01:24:46.614]  You'll get the video.
[01:24:46.734 --> 01:24:49.795]  I mean, you, I mean, I'm just, you can't make this up, but let me hit this.
[01:24:50.595 --> 01:25:01.620]  Russian's Foreign Minister Lavrov comes out and says, China's running a cultural revolution to cause a race war in America, to teach whites and blacks to hate each other, and it's wrong and it's evil.
[01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:05.642]  Big article, ZeroHedge.com, it's also on Infowars.com.
[01:25:06.002 --> 01:25:13.406]  But here's Charles Barkley, explaining, this is divide and conquer by the politicians to make us all fight with each other while they rob us.
[01:25:13.866 --> 01:25:15.027]  And of course that's true!
[01:25:15.267 --> 01:25:15.687]  Here it is.
[01:25:17.426 --> 01:25:27.629]  Yeah, but the one thing I took out of that piece was, man, I think most white people and black people are great people.
[01:25:28.669 --> 01:25:30.009]  I really believe that in my heart.
[01:25:30.529 --> 01:25:42.892]  But I think our system is set up where our politicians, whether they're Republicans or Democrats, are designed to make us not like each other so they can keep their grasp of money and power.
[01:25:43.593 --> 01:25:44.973]  They divide and conquer.
[01:25:45.746 --> 01:25:49.267]  I truly believe in my heart most white people and black people are awesome people.
[01:25:49.908 --> 01:25:54.629]  But we're so stupid following our politicians, whether they are Republicans or Democrats.
[01:25:55.290 --> 01:25:59.631]  And their only job is, hey, let's make these people not like each other.
[01:26:00.071 --> 01:26:01.712]  We don't live in their neighborhoods.
[01:26:02.212 --> 01:26:03.373]  We're all got money.
[01:26:03.793 --> 01:26:06.734]  Let's make the whites and blacks not like each other.
[01:26:07.094 --> 01:26:10.035]  Let's make rich people and poor people not like each other.
[01:26:10.875 --> 01:26:13.196]  Let's scramble the middle class.
[01:26:13.396 --> 01:26:14.917]  I truly believe that in my heart.
[01:26:15.077 --> 01:26:15.337]  That's right.
[01:26:15.397 --> 01:26:17.678]  It's in the WikiLeaks that that's what the Democrats did.
[01:26:17.738 --> 01:26:18.058]  Criminals.
[01:26:18.458 --> 01:26:23.740]  And then I've got all these articles of the Secretary of the Defense says white people are bad.
[01:26:23.780 --> 01:26:24.600]  He came out and said it.
[01:26:25.180 --> 01:26:27.121]  That's the head of the military to divide us, folks.
[01:26:27.441 --> 01:26:28.421]  He's ordered to do it.
[01:26:29.022 --> 01:26:31.783]  He's shaking when he says, yeah, the white people are bad.
[01:26:31.823 --> 01:26:33.863]  He's told to do that, folks.
[01:26:34.203 --> 01:26:35.584]  This is a takeover.
[01:26:36.769 --> 01:26:41.411]  They have one of the richest Asians in America, and all of a sudden the LA Times come out and say white people are bad and America's bad.
[01:26:41.771 --> 01:26:42.771]  It's all made up.
[01:26:42.871 --> 01:26:44.291]  It's a Chinese operation.
[01:26:44.592 --> 01:26:46.132]  Chinese communist operation.
[01:26:47.793 --> 01:26:50.473]  China's the most racist damn place on earth, you didn't know that?
[01:26:51.174 --> 01:26:53.054]  They don't let anybody in there that isn't Chinese.
[01:26:53.634 --> 01:26:57.296]  And they sit there, and I don't think it's the Chinese people, but man, I'm not gonna sit here and hear this crap anymore.
[01:26:57.696 --> 01:26:58.036]  I'm done.
[01:26:58.803 --> 01:27:02.824]  This is the most open-damned country in the world and they sit here and tell us we're all a bunch of bad people.
[01:27:03.025 --> 01:27:05.465]  This is a foreign military attack!
[01:27:05.986 --> 01:27:07.146]  And Biden's their agent!
[01:27:08.546 --> 01:27:09.387]  Alright, I'm out of time.
[01:27:10.227 --> 01:27:11.568]  Owen Schroer is about to take over.
[01:27:12.288 --> 01:27:13.648]  Pray for me, I'm going down to the border.
[01:27:14.329 --> 01:27:14.969]  I love you all.
[01:27:15.769 --> 01:27:17.970]  We got a Sunday Live coming up.
[01:27:19.116 --> 01:27:21.359]  Usually Owen pops in at the end to say what's coming up, but that's okay.
[01:27:21.719 --> 01:27:22.580]  He's about to come in here.
[01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:23.461]  He's got a lot to cover.
[01:27:23.802 --> 01:27:26.265]  Infowars.com forward slash shownewswars.com.
[01:27:26.665 --> 01:27:27.386]  We're fighting hard.
[01:27:27.426 --> 01:27:28.908]  I cede your word of mouth and your prayers, folks.
[01:27:29.709 --> 01:27:30.430]  Please spread the word.
[01:27:30.470 --> 01:27:30.911]  We're live.
[01:27:30.951 --> 01:27:32.493]  Two hours more of live transmission coming up.
[01:27:34.551 --> 01:27:45.799]  For the last four years, while the Chai Com-backed big tech has been censoring and blackballing and deplatforming conservatives, nationalists, and Christians, we've heard over and over again, oh, just build your own internet.
[01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:54.766]  But everybody that tries to build their own social media, that tries to build their own websites, that tries to build their own radio or TV networks, gets savagely attacked.
[01:27:55.266 --> 01:27:58.408]  In fact, if your network is successful, that's when they really come after you.
[01:27:58.448 --> 01:27:59.289]  This is predatory.
[01:27:59.769 --> 01:28:01.230]  This is martial law.
[01:28:01.290 --> 01:28:03.032]  This is information warfare.
[01:28:03.732 --> 01:28:06.754]  InfoWars is one of the only platforms still on air.
[01:28:07.354 --> 01:28:12.838]  We have an electronic Berlin Wall of tyranny and censorship and deplatforming descending everywhere.
[01:28:13.378 --> 01:28:14.619]  There's only a few people left.
[01:28:15.019 --> 01:28:15.879]  Rush Limbaugh's dead.
[01:28:15.939 --> 01:28:17.620]  Tucker Carlson's barely hanging on.
[01:28:18.121 --> 01:28:21.063]  But InfoWars is as strong as ever thanks to you.
[01:28:21.523 --> 01:28:26.346]  But I want to talk about something that doesn't just empower InfoWars, but empowers everyone together.
[01:28:26.846 --> 01:28:29.408]  And that's InfoWarsDomains.com.
[01:28:29.588 --> 01:28:31.929]  That's InfoWarsDomains.com.
[01:28:32.089 --> 01:28:43.757]  That link takes you right to Epic, the only major domain registrar that's been around for a long time that does not censor individuals because of their political or spiritual content.
[01:28:44.497 --> 01:28:47.238]  That's why you need to go to InfoWarsDomains.com.
[01:28:47.618 --> 01:28:54.540]  If you have domains that you've registered with GoDaddy or others, and move them there to InfoWarsDomains.com.
[01:28:54.901 --> 01:28:56.881]  If you go directly to Epic, they're awesome.
[01:28:56.901 --> 01:28:57.962]  They have servers.
[01:28:58.682 --> 01:29:00.462]  They have all sorts of other internet services.
[01:29:00.723 --> 01:29:07.045]  They basically have everything you need, and they are expanding because there is that need because of all the censorship and control.
[01:29:07.265 --> 01:29:10.766]  So they're building that free internet infrastructure that didn't exist.
[01:29:11.226 --> 01:29:13.507]  But when you go to InfoWarsDomains.com,
[01:29:14.187 --> 01:29:23.075]  It sends a link to them so that we get 25% of the sign-up and we get 5% of any server services or other things you get.
[01:29:23.375 --> 01:29:25.517]  So it's a win-win for everybody and it funds the InfoWar.
[01:29:25.757 --> 01:29:26.898]  It protects your domains.
[01:29:27.078 --> 01:29:28.279]  It helps you build your website.
[01:29:28.799 --> 01:29:31.742]  Whatever you do, go to InfoWarsDomains.com today and check it out.
[01:29:34.085 --> 01:29:35.746]  I want to give my crew a bonus.
[01:29:36.486 --> 01:29:37.326]  I do, they kick ass.
[01:29:38.567 --> 01:29:40.007]  Can't do it unless you buy products from us.
[01:29:40.368 --> 01:29:45.049]  And I'm not bitching at you, but I mean, it's like a gladiator when he goes in the ring and like chops up poor dudes.
[01:29:45.069 --> 01:29:46.650]  He says, are you not entertained?
[01:29:46.670 --> 01:29:48.431]  Is this what you freaking want, man?
[01:29:50.089 --> 01:29:51.110]  I mean, are you not entertained?
[01:29:51.390 --> 01:29:52.931]  Are you not getting what you paid for here?
[01:29:53.852 --> 01:29:56.473]  We are bashing our frickin' brains out to fight these people.
[01:29:56.834 --> 01:30:00.076]  So quite frankly, it's a disgrace that we barely fund this operation.
[01:30:00.916 --> 01:30:09.242]  It is an honor and a duty to do this, and I'm not complaining, but you need to flood us with money, because I've got ten reporters I'm ready to hire right now to flood the border.
[01:30:09.582 --> 01:30:12.123]  I got reporters, I got everything!
[01:30:12.603 --> 01:30:24.488]  I got the plans, I got the proof, I've got the proof of operations, I can get it done, but I spend half my damn time scrounging up frickin' greenbacks that aren't gonna be worth crap if this whole thing goes down.
[01:30:24.648 --> 01:30:32.592]  So, go to infowarestore.com and get filters, air filters, water filters, get the products, get the Brain Force Plus, get the...
[01:30:33.752 --> 01:30:43.380]  Turbo force get the vitamin mineral fusion get the toothpaste cuz I gotta sell a whole hell of a lot of this stuff to fund this operation And I just want to turn
[01:30:44.915 --> 01:30:51.379]  I got my eye on 10 reporters right now that are established, well-known names that I can have go out and work on their own operations under their own banner.
[01:30:52.019 --> 01:30:53.760]  I don't care about the credit, understand?
[01:30:54.080 --> 01:30:55.621]  But I need the money.
[01:30:56.021 --> 01:31:02.685]  I've already got a lot of people out there working, getting paid, or supporting that, you know, aren't publicly working with us for a lot of reasons.
[01:31:02.725 --> 01:31:04.986]  Before they ever banned me, I was doing that.
[01:31:05.006 --> 01:31:06.507]  You know the enjoyment I get?
[01:31:06.567 --> 01:31:08.868]  The enemy doesn't even know how many floors underground this thing goes.
[01:31:09.148 --> 01:31:10.129]  I mean that metaphysically.
[01:31:11.069 --> 01:31:11.570]  I like that.
[01:31:11.750 --> 01:31:15.374]  I like not having all my cards showing, but I'm just telling you what you deserve to know.
[01:31:15.694 --> 01:31:16.956]  You see what we do above ground?
[01:31:17.316 --> 01:31:18.697]  Imagine what's going on behind the scenes.
[01:31:18.777 --> 01:31:21.380]  We are literally gutting the New World Order.
[01:31:22.341 --> 01:31:24.103]  So much of the resistance is this operation.
[01:31:24.523 --> 01:31:25.664]  You think InfoWars is a big part?
[01:31:25.725 --> 01:31:27.667]  If you knew the rest of it, you'd be blown away.
[01:31:28.007 --> 01:31:29.188]  I need money now.
[01:31:29.629 --> 01:31:30.550]  I need energy now.
[01:31:30.690 --> 01:31:31.490]  I will wage war.
[01:31:31.711 --> 01:31:32.411]  I need funds.
[01:31:32.692 --> 01:31:33.573]  InfoWarsTore.com.
