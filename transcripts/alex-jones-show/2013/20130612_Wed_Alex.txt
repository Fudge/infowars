[00:00:06.226 --> 00:00:10.407]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:11.047 --> 00:00:11.868]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.648 --> 00:00:13.508]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.188 --> 00:00:17.829]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.431]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:42.188 --> 00:00:45.769]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to another worldwide transmission.
[00:00:45.869 --> 00:01:03.033]  It is Wednesday, the 12th day of June, 2013, and I really want to give the listeners and viewers of this broadcast a chance to sound off on all the things that have been unfolding from our coverage
[00:01:04.434 --> 00:01:14.187]  from our coverage of the globalist and the different activities that they've been involved in at Bilderberg to
[00:01:18.427 --> 00:01:28.691]  The demonization by the Republican and Democratic parties of Snowden leaking the fact that the NSA is spying on every man, woman, and child.
[00:01:29.031 --> 00:01:29.951]  We already knew that.
[00:01:29.991 --> 00:01:38.474]  They're already using them to spy and harass on the press talking to whistleblowers that are exposing government criminal activity.
[00:01:39.635 --> 00:01:45.397]  They went after ATF people that blew the whistle on them shipping guns into Mexico so they could blame the Second Amendment.
[00:01:46.365 --> 00:01:49.307]  And now they're trying to say this guy's a Chinese spy or something.
[00:01:49.967 --> 00:01:59.413]  What about people being globalist spies, globalist corporate operatives in our government robbing the Treasury and robbing us of our Bill of Rights and Constitution?
[00:02:00.673 --> 00:02:14.982]  And then you've got the illegal immigration reform bill, which is written like Obamacare, where it has some nice sounding words in it, but then is just a blank check for government to do whatever it wants.
[00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:20.502]  And the globalists want a North American Union to drive down wages.
[00:02:20.602 --> 00:02:25.145]  Not to raise Mexican wages, but to drive down wages.
[00:02:26.046 --> 00:02:28.507]  And Mexico doesn't have to open its borders to Guatemala.
[00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:33.791]  You get six months hard labor if you're an illegal, they'll catch you there.
[00:02:35.452 --> 00:02:41.136]  And Schumer is quoted as saying, illegal immigration will be a thing of the past.
[00:02:42.133 --> 00:02:50.464]  Go to DrudgeReport.com, it's got a powerful image of a Los Zetas with Obama tattooed on his stomach.
[00:02:51.245 --> 00:02:54.029]  This is the type of amazing stuff that's going on.
[00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.913]  And folks, I've been to Mexico probably, let's not exaggerate.
[00:02:58.355 --> 00:02:58.935]  30, 40 times.
[00:03:00.036 --> 00:03:01.497]  And there's a lot of neat stuff about Mexico.
[00:03:01.557 --> 00:03:02.978]  There's also a lot of horrible things about it.
[00:03:02.998 --> 00:03:04.880]  It's one of the most dangerous countries in the world.
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.903]  And the Southwest is just collapsing into third world-dom.
[00:03:09.283 --> 00:03:10.865]  That's exactly what the system wants.
[00:03:10.905 --> 00:03:14.748]  Meanwhile, Rand Paul says to illegals, we will find you a place.
[00:03:14.808 --> 00:03:20.852]  We will try to get a good bill to legalize legal, lawful people that have been here.
[00:03:21.113 --> 00:03:23.254]  Because if you're legal, it takes you 10, 15, 20 years
[00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.061]  Ten years to get here, and then ten years to become a citizen.
[00:03:28.381 --> 00:03:33.023]  It's too hard for people law-abiding, Lee, to become a citizen.
[00:03:33.523 --> 00:03:35.324]  Because the system doesn't want you to go that route.
[00:03:35.344 --> 00:03:39.466]  They want you to go the illegal route, so you can have multiple identities and further bankrupt the country.
[00:03:39.766 --> 00:03:41.086]  It's all been actuaried out.
[00:03:41.506 --> 00:03:52.471]  Your taxpayer money goes to fund the illegals, with all the welfare and stuff, as a corporate incentive, as a corporate welfare, to bring in a group that will work for less than you can live on.
[00:03:54.346 --> 00:03:59.329]  Meanwhile, Senator Tim Kaine speaks in Spanish on the Senate floor, pushes an immigration bill.
[00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:11.715]  I wonder what would happen in Mexico if somebody went down there and spoke in their Congress in English and said, let's legalize any Americans that want to come here, let's give them free health care, let them have their babies here and pay for it.
[00:04:12.056 --> 00:04:15.497]  I mean, they would laugh you out of the place.
[00:04:15.517 --> 00:04:21.941]  And if you said, be loving, don't be mean to the Americano, you'd probably get shot.
[00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.796]  Because Mexico, for all its failures, is at least nationalistic.
[00:04:27.237 --> 00:04:32.867]  America has had its immune system politically completely dropped, where we will put up with anything.
[00:04:33.649 --> 00:04:38.850]  Meanwhile, Snowden's put out a new statement saying he's not hiding more explosive details on U.S.
[00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.391]  surveillance targets, his plans for the immediate future, steps up claims the U.S.
[00:04:43.411 --> 00:04:46.892]  has taken since he broke cover in Hong Kong.
[00:04:47.172 --> 00:04:48.993]  Folks, I don't need to believe Snowden.
[00:04:49.013 --> 00:04:50.413]  This stuff's actually all public.
[00:04:51.073 --> 00:04:53.053]  What he's saying is not hardcore enough.
[00:04:53.654 --> 00:04:56.914]  It's about, let's not exaggerate, ten times worse than what he's saying.
[00:04:57.314 --> 00:04:59.275]  Stay with us, big transmission coming up.
[00:05:05.709 --> 00:05:06.630]  Tyranny is here.
[00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.472]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:05:10.512 --> 00:05:13.113]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:05:13.133 --> 00:05:18.576]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:05:18.997 --> 00:05:25.260]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:31.224]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:05:31.644 --> 00:05:35.326]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:05:35.806 --> 00:05:39.789]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:46.033]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:05:46.053 --> 00:05:48.995]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:05:49.596 --> 00:05:50.997]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:05:51.577 --> 00:05:52.077]  It's here.

[00:08:05.823 --> 00:08:12.168]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:27.059 --> 00:08:34.925]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Wednesday, the 12th day
[00:08:37.384 --> 00:08:40.225]  Of June 2013, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:08:40.245 --> 00:08:42.926]  We'll be live here for the next three hours.
[00:08:43.346 --> 00:08:51.770]  I do have a big whistleblower coming on the broadcast tonight to talk about a host of issues on the nightly news.
[00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:53.450]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:08:54.011 --> 00:08:59.813]  And we have another whistleblower from inside Big Telecom who put in the snooping systems coming back.
[00:08:59.833 --> 00:09:04.355]  We actually have two whistleblowers from industry and the Pentagon.
[00:09:05.995 --> 00:09:11.176]  Coming on the transmission tonight, InfoWars Nightly News, 7 o'clock Central.
[00:09:12.516 --> 00:09:13.877]  I'm going to tape the interviews before.
[00:09:13.937 --> 00:09:15.717]  Sometimes the show's live, tonight it'll be taped.
[00:09:16.557 --> 00:09:19.738]  And then tomorrow we should have excerpts on the radio show for you.
[00:09:20.178 --> 00:09:31.320]  Before I get into the latest on the NSA scandal, the IRS scandal, Benghazigate, before I get into all of it, I had a realization this morning when I woke up at about 4 a.m.
[00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:33.921]  I guess I'm still kind of on London time.
[00:09:35.441 --> 00:09:36.361]  Hours ahead of us.
[00:09:37.562 --> 00:09:41.103]  Just getting back from London Monday, covering Bilderberg.
[00:09:41.843 --> 00:09:55.868]  I had the realization that they now have media matters who doesn't matter to the public, but it does matter because it's White House funded, White House run, White House transition chief, George Soros funded.
[00:09:56.968 --> 00:10:02.810]  They spend more time attacking InfoWars.com and this radio show
[00:10:04.045 --> 00:10:06.167]  And yours truly, Alex Jones.
[00:10:07.649 --> 00:10:09.971]  That may do on anybody else now.
[00:10:11.793 --> 00:10:14.375]  Matt Drudge, Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck.
[00:10:16.017 --> 00:10:20.741]  No, it's Alex Jones and also Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
[00:10:21.282 --> 00:10:24.265]  Because, you know, that shows you who they're really scared of.
[00:10:25.906 --> 00:10:31.010]  Some weeks they attack Drudge as much as they attack us, in fact more, but lately it's been yours truly.
[00:10:31.911 --> 00:10:34.012]  And that is directly run by the White House.
[00:10:35.213 --> 00:10:38.196]  And they're attacking us because they know we know what we're talking about.
[00:10:39.797 --> 00:10:52.247]  And then when they had Bloomberg, because I reread that article this morning, when they had Bloomberg come out and in a big feature story, and called an investigative report,
[00:10:53.363 --> 00:11:09.335]  And say Alex Jones basically caused the Boston bombing, and they had the quote by the Southern Poverty Slime Center, who actually has been caught in court with one of their guys shooting up the, what was the Family Research Council, and saying he did it because of them.
[00:11:10.656 --> 00:11:12.437]  So they've actually been caught in all that.
[00:11:13.458 --> 00:11:21.344]  They are then quoted as experts in there, saying Alex Jones doesn't build bombs, he builds bombers.
[00:11:23.186 --> 00:11:25.467]  And I was on Eric Mancow Muller's show.
[00:11:25.587 --> 00:11:30.228]  By the way, he's got a new big history show coming out, so congratulations to him.
[00:11:30.248 --> 00:11:31.748]  That's actually a big show with his brother.
[00:11:35.669 --> 00:11:39.730]  The point is, I was on there and he said, why are they saying this about you?
[00:11:40.191 --> 00:11:45.232]  Everybody knows that you're against offensive violence and that you expose bombings.
[00:11:47.543 --> 00:11:49.984]  As many times being government funded to take our liberties.
[00:11:50.445 --> 00:11:52.706]  And then he went on to apologize basically on air.
[00:11:53.506 --> 00:11:56.488]  And say, I thought you were a kook ten years ago when I first started interviewing you.
[00:11:56.828 --> 00:11:57.589]  It's all come true.
[00:11:57.669 --> 00:11:58.529]  I apologize.
[00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:02.651]  And you better watch your back when they're doing stuff like this.
[00:12:03.072 --> 00:12:05.253]  And it was funny he brought that up and said it.
[00:12:06.894 --> 00:12:10.996]  Because I was already thinking that this morning and then I'm on his show.
[00:12:11.016 --> 00:12:11.076]  And
[00:12:18.382 --> 00:12:19.422]  He was talking about it.
[00:12:21.643 --> 00:12:24.305]  He was saying the same thing I was already thinking.
[00:12:24.325 --> 00:12:25.465]  He's a really smart guy.
[00:12:30.867 --> 00:12:32.788]  I mean, they would not be coming out.
[00:12:33.209 --> 00:12:34.429]  I really thought about it this morning.
[00:12:34.469 --> 00:12:36.030]  I woke up and I thought about it for a couple of hours.
[00:12:38.331 --> 00:12:40.892]  There in the dark of the house before the kids and my wife woke up.
[00:12:43.444 --> 00:12:56.475]  Sitting there reading that article and thinking about it and then looking at all the other demonization pieces and everything and what popped out of my little computer, what popped out of my brain like the old data cards was Danger Will Robinson.
[00:12:58.357 --> 00:13:04.442]  They would not come out and say that I'm connected to bombers and that I make bombers.
[00:13:06.564 --> 00:13:08.626]  Which even though I'm a public figure I could
[00:13:11.018 --> 00:13:17.723]  I could probably, if I really wanted to fight the case and do it right and file in the right district and everything, I could get a judgment against Bloomberg.
[00:13:18.943 --> 00:13:21.805]  We got a judgment against Pittsburgh, one of my reporters.
[00:13:23.286 --> 00:13:24.007]  Are they settled?
[00:13:25.568 --> 00:13:27.489]  I mean, I know the law pretty darn well.
[00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:29.751]  I made a study of it, it's very interesting.
[00:13:30.551 --> 00:13:33.413]  And they would not be risking things like that.
[00:13:33.974 --> 00:13:35.235]  There it is, human bombs.
[00:13:35.275 --> 00:13:37.636]  He does not build bombs, he builds bombers.
[00:13:37.656 --> 00:13:38.217]  They set it up on
[00:13:39.269 --> 00:13:39.589]  Screen.
[00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:42.231]  And it's not just some of them quoting him.
[00:13:45.594 --> 00:13:47.715]  They say that over and over again in the article.
[00:13:49.237 --> 00:13:56.082]  And basically say the bombers did it because they were my listeners when they've killed two FBI agents that were on the scene.
[00:13:56.562 --> 00:13:57.583]  There was a drill.
[00:13:59.224 --> 00:14:02.466]  They've now killed one of the witnesses that was talking to his friends.
[00:14:02.486 --> 00:14:06.950]  I mean, I've been contacted by lawyers and family members and everything else off record.
[00:14:08.228 --> 00:14:10.989]  And I've told them, okay, if you want to go public here, that's fine.
[00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:12.810]  And they're all being surveilled.
[00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:18.453]  The system is really afraid of the fact that we really caught them staging the London bombing.
[00:14:19.233 --> 00:14:20.894]  Those two brothers were total patsies.
[00:14:21.194 --> 00:14:23.015]  They were both on CIA payroll.
[00:14:23.515 --> 00:14:25.075]  That's come out in the foreign press.
[00:14:25.976 --> 00:14:26.856]  It's been confirmed.
[00:14:26.876 --> 00:14:27.597]  Boston bombing.
[00:14:28.577 --> 00:14:29.277]  Boston bombing.
[00:14:29.657 --> 00:14:30.498]  What bombing did I say?
[00:14:31.636 --> 00:14:32.217]  London bombing.
[00:14:32.437 --> 00:14:39.847]  Well, that too was carried out by MI6 and they had drills of targeting the same buses and the same trains at the very exact same time.
[00:14:41.189 --> 00:14:48.618]  And then I was approached by police, MI5, security people all over London saying, oh, we all know the truth, we all know.
[00:14:49.974 --> 00:14:51.054]  You know that that was staged.
[00:14:51.554 --> 00:15:15.422]  It just makes the head spin that they're coming after us because we freak them out by catching them with their pants down in a drill with Patsy's who were on CIA payroll on record being sent to the caucuses to go around and basically radicalize and create Al Qaeda cells to attack Russian held areas.
[00:15:17.062 --> 00:15:19.103]  As is an admitted publicly funded program.
[00:15:20.919 --> 00:15:30.092]  And they do not like the fact that I'm sitting here covering the things they're doing because they want to pull off more bombings to basically phase in martial law.
[00:15:30.432 --> 00:15:33.517]  They want to stage bombings to blame the Tea Party.
[00:15:37.628 --> 00:15:38.569]  They want this.
[00:15:39.329 --> 00:15:40.270]  I know their mind.
[00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:42.092]  I eat, drink, and sleep this.
[00:15:42.612 --> 00:15:43.433]  I know the history.
[00:15:43.753 --> 00:15:45.514]  I know how Operation Gladio worked.
[00:15:45.534 --> 00:16:03.669]  Listen, in India, in Italy, in Germany, in England, in all these places, they can't even stage bombings anymore because it's come out that almost every IRA bombing for 40 years was MI6, MI5, SAS commandos.
[00:16:03.749 --> 00:16:06.331]  That's London Guardian, Times of London.
[00:16:06.351 --> 00:16:07.172]  I mean, that's admitted.
[00:16:08.513 --> 00:16:10.974]  You tell Brits that there, they don't laugh at you, they go, I know.
[00:16:11.494 --> 00:16:14.575]  You know, Operation, you know, Operative Steakknife and all the rest of it.
[00:16:15.456 --> 00:16:20.858]  By the way, I interviewed Steakknife and then he was dead a month later.
[00:16:20.878 --> 00:16:25.540]  You know how many people I've interviewed, like the Boston Madam and Steakknife, who they kill?
[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:27.501]  I mean, I can't believe I'm still alive.
[00:16:27.741 --> 00:16:33.263]  It just hit me that, I mean, I am fearless.
[00:16:35.202 --> 00:16:42.589]  But it hit me, the reason I'm so angry is my flesh, my worldly side, is extremely angry at me.
[00:16:42.649 --> 00:16:50.917]  I was psychoanalyzing this morning why I don't like myself, why I'm so angry, why I'm so focused, why I'm so serious now.
[00:16:50.937 --> 00:16:53.059]  And I used to be a really funny, happy person.
[00:17:03.208 --> 00:17:12.514]  And it just comes down to the realization that it's all real, it's worse than I even thought, and I'm right in the middle of it.
[00:17:13.614 --> 00:17:16.156]  And the people that want to do this type of stuff
[00:17:18.407 --> 00:17:22.932]  To be technical, Steak Knife was kind of a name for several people in an operation.
[00:17:23.433 --> 00:17:27.297]  But I had an army commando on who blew the whistle and admitted it all, admitted to bombings and things.
[00:17:27.597 --> 00:17:28.779]  He'd been in one newspaper.
[00:17:28.819 --> 00:17:30.120]  He turned out he was a listener.
[00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:31.542]  He contacted us.
[00:17:31.602 --> 00:17:32.183]  I got him on.
[00:17:32.203 --> 00:17:33.084]  He was dead a month later.
[00:17:34.312 --> 00:17:39.333]  I interviewed another whistleblower over in England, and he got machine gunned off his motorcycle.
[00:17:39.733 --> 00:17:50.696]  That's why when I got approached by police and then by MI5, these guys were sitting there going, look, we all know it's true, we know you're right, and you better be safe, and we wish we could change things.
[00:17:50.756 --> 00:17:52.376]  It's because they all know, folks.
[00:17:55.137 --> 00:17:59.398]  And that's why I could go to England, and I could have
[00:18:01.684 --> 00:18:14.888]  Police, MI5, and others come to me and say, members of Bilderberg are going to go public, they're completely freaked out, you guys are doing a great job, and basically, you know, we support what you're doing.
[00:18:17.848 --> 00:18:22.770]  Because you see, MI5, they know how many of those guys in there are child molesters.
[00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:27.491]  You know, the average person in the government is not a criminal.
[00:18:30.228 --> 00:18:32.369]  And now they're all having a crisis of conscience.
[00:18:32.409 --> 00:18:35.389]  That's why you're going to see more and more whistleblowers coming out.
[00:18:35.709 --> 00:18:38.410]  I mean, who do you think wants total power and to do evil things?
[00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:40.150]  Really bad people.
[00:18:41.371 --> 00:18:41.991]  That's history.
[00:18:44.272 --> 00:18:50.033]  And it's a collection of different types of criminals, but I just had the realization
[00:18:56.673 --> 00:19:02.615]  That we really are having a huge effect, and that we are, I am, in danger.
[00:19:04.035 --> 00:19:17.239]  Because my gut is always right, and my gut has never told me that I am on the edge of the precipice, like my gut has told me.
[00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:21.020]  And my gut's never told me
[00:19:23.831 --> 00:19:25.392]  That I'm doing a good job, like it's telling me.
[00:19:25.412 --> 00:19:33.018]  So, you know, I've got one side of me, the side that leans towards God and creation and everything that's good, is saying, well done!
[00:19:34.039 --> 00:19:35.160]  You're gonna get a good report.
[00:19:36.021 --> 00:19:39.063]  But my flesh is like, why don't you enjoy yourself?
[00:19:39.443 --> 00:19:40.424]  Why don't you slow down?
[00:19:40.464 --> 00:19:42.045]  Why don't you go along with the system a little?
[00:19:42.406 --> 00:19:43.667]  You don't need to destroy yourself.
[00:19:45.043 --> 00:19:46.464]  But you know what my soul says?
[00:19:46.824 --> 00:19:47.845]  Full speed ahead.
[00:19:47.865 --> 00:19:49.366]  Intensify.
[00:19:50.267 --> 00:19:52.349]  Accelerate to ramming speed.
[00:19:52.829 --> 00:19:54.230]  And that's the decision I'm making.
[00:19:54.711 --> 00:19:55.952]  It's like I told you a year ago.
[00:19:56.272 --> 00:19:57.953]  We're taking the info war to the next level.
[00:19:58.333 --> 00:20:00.155]  Now, I'm taking it to the next level.
[00:20:03.186 --> 00:20:04.507]  Hello, this is Steve Schenck.

[00:20:27.187 --> 00:20:37.695]  For example, the rising cost of food, especially beef, last year's worst drought in 50 years, and the mandated ethanol production has dried up the feed supply for livestock.
[00:20:38.055 --> 00:20:41.998]  Chinese are offering $4.7 billion to buy our largest pork producer.

[00:21:30.834 --> 00:21:40.098]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:21:40.159 --> 00:21:40.899]  This capitalism?
[00:21:40.959 --> 00:21:47.042]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:21:47.222 --> 00:21:47.983]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:21:48.023 --> 00:21:51.125]  I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[00:24:17.844 --> 00:24:40.952]  You've been noticing that Al Franken, the scumbag authoritarian filth, the degenerate lover of death, Bill Maher, who says more abortion, more car wrecks, more death, because humans are scum, get rid of us, less people, but ban the guns for the children because he cares if people die, but kill Granny so he can get more money.
[00:24:42.552 --> 00:24:43.653]  But he loves you.
[00:24:44.034 --> 00:24:57.225]  Bill Maher, all of them have come out in defense of Obama and warrantless across the board spying against the Associated Press, the media, Fast and Furious, government whistleblowers.
[00:24:58.206 --> 00:25:05.568]  How many times have I had NSA insiders like Seibel Edmonds on to tell you the NSA is really aimed at whistleblowers?
[00:25:05.628 --> 00:25:07.288]  In fact, let's get Wayne Madsen back on.
[00:25:07.828 --> 00:25:11.369]  Wayne Madsen, NSA whistleblower, when he left decades ago.
[00:25:12.009 --> 00:25:13.449]  Journalist, syndicated columnist.
[00:25:14.689 --> 00:25:27.112]  He said that Obama shifted even more than Bush to taking like a third of the NSA, to paraphrase him, he said a large portion of it, to just focus on the press and just focus on their opposition for dirty tricks.
[00:25:29.452 --> 00:25:30.993]  And he said that like three years ago.
[00:25:31.533 --> 00:25:36.116]  I was just thinking about, you know, I said, our sources said this, and I'm thinking, why did I know that?
[00:25:37.557 --> 00:25:41.219]  Well, because it's come out, but also I know the details from people that said it beforehand.
[00:25:41.559 --> 00:25:42.920]  And I started thinking, who told me that?
[00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:45.422]  Colonel Schaefer, who's coming on tomorrow.
[00:25:47.022 --> 00:25:47.963]  Big whistleblower.
[00:25:51.045 --> 00:25:54.707]  C. Bell Edmonds, NSA, FBI translator.
[00:25:56.488 --> 00:25:57.649]  NSA, high-level
[00:26:00.126 --> 00:26:05.428]  Really a commander, a division chief of the whole sector, Wayne Madsen.
[00:26:05.648 --> 00:26:08.549]  I mean, we know all this, but I don't just believe my sources.
[00:26:08.909 --> 00:26:12.050]  I separately have studied the funding and the infrastructure.
[00:26:14.051 --> 00:26:19.412]  And the globalists love to brag, so much of it is public, so we know how big it is.
[00:26:19.773 --> 00:26:26.875]  And now you see Boehner, aka Boehner, you see Chuckie Schumer, you see them all,
[00:26:28.706 --> 00:26:35.799]  Coming out, bipartisan treason, and saying this man Snowden, he's a traitor.
[00:26:37.782 --> 00:26:41.970]  And the only way Snowden is a traitor, Edward Snowden,
[00:26:44.287 --> 00:26:53.954]  Is if it's an elaborate hoax, with all the NSA stuff already out, to make it come out that he is a Chinese or Russian spy, to make it look traitorous to expose this.
[00:26:54.275 --> 00:26:59.218]  And watching, you know, what he said, and looking at him in his history, he doesn't fit the MO of that.
[00:27:00.199 --> 00:27:06.364]  Because the revelations would have been smaller if... My gut tells me Snowden is for real.
[00:27:08.524 --> 00:27:10.165]  Let me tell you who a traitor is, is Boehner.
[00:27:10.426 --> 00:27:15.029]  It turns out Congress, and Ron Paul and Rand Paul, they'll talk about this now, has been briefed.
[00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:18.472]  They were given national security gag orders that I don't believe are constitutional.
[00:27:18.752 --> 00:27:24.998]  I mean, the Congress and the Intelligence Committee, they're in charge of all this.
[00:27:25.158 --> 00:27:32.304]  And to allow the NSA and the Pentagon to dictate to them is the cart before the horse.
[00:27:32.784 --> 00:27:37.248]  And really, it's an excuse to go along with all this.
[00:27:39.753 --> 00:27:42.736]  I mean, it's come out that the cloakroom was being tapped.
[00:27:44.057 --> 00:27:55.128]  And I even predicted, oh, they'll claim it's Democratic operatives or private corporations doing it, because 99% of the spying now, literally, is done by 800,000 private contractors.
[00:27:56.769 --> 00:27:57.550]  Look at Snowden!
[00:27:59.632 --> 00:28:01.273]  He was working for a big private group.
[00:28:04.036 --> 00:28:04.877]  What, Booz Allen?
[00:28:08.268 --> 00:28:12.331]  So, that's the issue here, is they're spying on each other.
[00:28:12.351 --> 00:28:23.959]  I mean, it came out a few years ago that MI6 and MI5 were spying on the Parliament, on the elected government, to be able to have the bureaucracy head them off at the pass.
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:31.925]  What's happening is the bureaucracy is completely taking over, and the bureaucracy isn't even a government bureaucracy.
[00:28:32.965 --> 00:28:34.967]  It's a private corporate bureaucracy.
[00:28:36.268 --> 00:28:37.489]  I was reading where one
[00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:46.616]  A spy firm just in cybersecurity last month got a $10 billion contract for 2014.
[00:28:48.778 --> 00:28:52.541]  One company just on spying on us, $10 billion.
[00:28:52.661 --> 00:28:59.727]  I mean, you go to these NSA bases, and entire wings are run by different defense contractors.
[00:29:00.047 --> 00:29:01.629]  A lot of them are foreign companies.
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:05.921]  But, oh, they're always, do what we say, let us spy on you.
[00:29:05.961 --> 00:29:08.642]  We're fighting against the Russians and the Chinese.
[00:29:08.702 --> 00:29:10.202]  If we weren't here, they would get you.
[00:29:10.662 --> 00:29:11.623]  They would get me?
[00:29:12.283 --> 00:29:14.624]  The globalists have already moved all our jobs to China.
[00:29:15.224 --> 00:29:18.685]  The globalists are in bed with the communist Chinese, because they're authoritarians.
[00:29:19.245 --> 00:29:19.725]  Like them!
[00:29:19.745 --> 00:29:28.048]  So when we come back, I'm going to get to some of these clips with Ron Paul, Rand Paul, and others.
[00:29:28.068 --> 00:29:31.389]  But we're going to get Wayne Madsen on today, if not tomorrow.
[00:29:34.332 --> 00:29:35.252]  He is on today.
[00:29:35.272 --> 00:29:36.153]  We were working on it earlier.
[00:29:36.193 --> 00:29:37.033]  He is on today.
[00:29:37.373 --> 00:29:37.834]  One o'clock.
[00:29:38.334 --> 00:29:39.855]  So in an hour and thirty minutes, T-minus.
[00:29:39.895 --> 00:29:42.116]  I'm gonna have him really get into NSA.
[00:29:42.136 --> 00:29:43.936]  I mean, he is the expert on this.
[00:29:44.417 --> 00:29:49.039]  And then I've got bombshell whistleblowers on tonight, seven o'clock central.
[00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:51.700]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:53.801]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.741 --> 00:29:57.403]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.372 --> 00:30:05.415]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms.
[00:30:05.776 --> 00:30:11.241]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[00:30:11.822 --> 00:30:15.025]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?
[00:30:15.706 --> 00:30:16.967]  Check out SimpliSafe.
[00:30:17.308 --> 00:30:21.172]  It's a new do-it-yourself home security system that is completely wireless.

[00:30:38.203 --> 00:30:39.724]  Get SimpliSafe.com

[00:30:47.926 --> 00:30:51.487]  If you move or need to relocate, you can take the system with you wherever you go.
[00:30:52.007 --> 00:30:58.448]  You aren't always at home, but SimplySafe will stand guard, protecting your property 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
[00:30:59.008 --> 00:31:01.169]  Again, that's GetSimplySafe.com.
[00:31:02.333 --> 00:31:03.353]  I had tried everything.
[00:31:03.413 --> 00:31:08.475]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating, I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[00:31:08.895 --> 00:31:13.376]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[00:31:13.716 --> 00:31:20.098]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[00:31:20.578 --> 00:31:31.066]  Now there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[00:31:31.807 --> 00:31:35.930]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:42.315]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[00:31:42.535 --> 00:31:43.676]  Now that's results.
[00:31:44.076 --> 00:31:56.103]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to Infowarsteam.com and to order just three of their products and you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.

[00:32:30.084 --> 00:32:36.307]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.
[00:32:37.387 --> 00:32:48.292]  But rather, we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera, to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin, while delivering the silver more effectively.

[00:33:02.413 --> 00:33:07.257]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:07.617 --> 00:33:08.278]  Watch me!
[00:33:09.478 --> 00:33:10.159]  Watch me!
[00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:11.980]  I got it!
[00:33:13.301 --> 00:33:14.002]  Watch me!
[00:33:15.283 --> 00:33:15.743]  I got it!
[00:33:15.943 --> 00:33:16.864]  I've absolutely
[00:33:19.282 --> 00:33:20.783]  Got to get into all this news.
[00:33:21.183 --> 00:33:46.871]  I mean, Obama outside of Congress is putting, with an executive order, it's not even an executive order, it's just an executive directive added on to microwave oven regulations, boosting the price of carbon in the United States, that's paid into carbon trading funds that he and the pig, piece of garbage, death camp owning in China,
[00:33:47.888 --> 00:33:55.052]  A slave camp owning in China Al Gore, you have to pay money into them.
[00:33:55.192 --> 00:34:01.896]  I mean, it's a totally criminal conflict of interest waddling around in front of us with the general public in a coma.
[00:34:02.756 --> 00:34:04.557]  That's why I get so angry at these people.
[00:34:04.897 --> 00:34:09.380]  They are just the most disgusting authoritarian scumbag criminals.
[00:34:10.385 --> 00:34:27.395]  And you've got all these camp followers, so-called liberals, that are really authoritarians, who feel like they're part of a gang, who will salute and support drone killing, torture, funding Al-Qaeda, spying on us, warrantless checkpoints, government arming to the teeth against the people.
[00:34:28.336 --> 00:34:31.438]  And as long as they feel like they're winners and are part of the establishment, they're for it.
[00:34:32.912 --> 00:34:34.873]  So we're going to get into all of that.
[00:34:34.893 --> 00:34:39.335]  I'm going to get into the whistleblowing on the NSA in detail.
[00:34:40.355 --> 00:34:42.296]  We're going to open the phones up and take your calls.
[00:34:42.336 --> 00:34:43.557]  Wayne Madsen is going to join us.
[00:34:44.217 --> 00:34:49.980]  Just briefly, we sold out the last edition of InfoWars Magazine.
[00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:51.740]  Most editions sell out.
[00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:52.861]  This one will probably sell out.
[00:34:52.941 --> 00:34:54.622]  It's the Elite Plan Global Takeover.
[00:34:55.222 --> 00:34:58.964]  Welcome to Bilderberg, a big, glossy color magazine.
[00:34:59.524 --> 00:35:01.305]  Great way to wake up friends and family.
[00:35:01.345 --> 00:35:04.687]  You can sign up for a 12-month subscription and give it as a gift.
[00:35:05.147 --> 00:35:07.168]  Shipping is included in the subscription price.
[00:35:07.628 --> 00:35:12.991]  Twelve big, thick color magazines to wake people up, full of graphics and factoids and graphs.
[00:35:13.471 --> 00:35:19.975]  Great way to wake people up with a gift subscription to your library, your police department, your congressman or woman, your state rep.
[00:35:21.256 --> 00:35:24.599]  Great thing to give to your church as a gift subscription.
[00:35:24.639 --> 00:35:27.702]  Great thing to leave at the dentist office or the barber shop.
[00:35:28.003 --> 00:35:32.507]  You can also buy each particular issue in groups of 10 up to 100 at cost.
[00:35:32.948 --> 00:35:37.733]  People really pay attention nowadays to print because there's so little of it and the quality of it's so bad.
[00:35:38.053 --> 00:35:38.934]  This is so high.
[00:35:39.174 --> 00:35:41.457]  Got a big graphic with a map of the Bilderberg Group.
[00:35:42.077 --> 00:35:43.399]  With a skull in the middle.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.002]  Very, very powerful.
[00:35:45.382 --> 00:35:47.585]  So, InfoWars June issue.
[00:35:48.166 --> 00:35:52.352]  Available at InfoWarsStore.com or by calling toll free.

[00:35:58.411 --> 00:36:08.376]  You can also get 10% off on all of the ProPure water filtration systems by only calling the toll-free number until tonight.
[00:36:08.756 --> 00:36:12.938]  You can still get that 15% off because some of you called and said you forgot to do it.
[00:36:13.259 --> 00:36:21.383]  15% off the already lowest prices on all the stainless steel gravity-fed filters, the ProOne stuff that cuts out the fluoride, all of it, replacement filters, you name it.
[00:36:21.783 --> 00:36:31.911]  888-253-3139, 888-253-3139 to call and get that 50% off or get a subscription or whatever you want.

[00:36:36.555 --> 00:36:38.917]  That's special in perpetuity right now.
[00:36:39.935 --> 00:36:41.015]  into the foreseeable future.
[00:36:41.055 --> 00:36:42.475]  So, InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:36:42.776 --> 00:36:59.218]  Get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership and you see the nightly news, the higher quality archives, the daytime show, the commercial-free podcast, all my films, my book, Paul Watson's book, dozens and dozens of other films, uh... eighteen years of material up and running, eleven years.
[00:36:59.578 --> 00:37:00.799]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:37:01.259 --> 00:37:07.660]  One membership is $5.95 a month and it's really eleven memberships, so less than fifty-five cents per person per month.
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:20.510]  A great way to wake people up if you have a membership and you're not sharing it, be sure and share your username and passcode with friends and family today and encourage them to watch the nightly news, especially tonight with these whistleblowers, PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:37:22.572 --> 00:37:27.316]  Not even the word whistleblower, because these people are coming on and just talking about on record what's going on.
[00:37:28.476 --> 00:37:31.019]  So, I forgot one guy doesn't want to be called that.
[00:37:31.039 --> 00:37:34.722]  He's just getting into what as a citizen is on record and what he can talk about.
[00:37:35.847 --> 00:37:39.990]  But you notice when we have big whistleblowers, though, you never hear about it.
[00:37:40.751 --> 00:37:42.592]  Because they just hope nobody picks up on it.
[00:37:43.293 --> 00:37:44.654]  But more and more people are.
[00:37:47.095 --> 00:37:59.885]  Oh, and finally, we have the best vitamins, minerals, trace elements, cofactors, the very best products out there across the board for weight control, for health, for longevity.

[00:38:04.508 --> 00:38:05.869]  We're good to go.

[00:38:37.331 --> 00:38:38.192]  But this broadcast is
[00:38:38.952 --> 00:38:53.685]  Listener supported and please in closing also support all of our AM and FM affiliates by being a local sponsor or supporting the local sponsors and letting them know that you are supporting the broadcast and as always spread the word about the broadcast that is most important and pray for us.
[00:38:54.265 --> 00:38:58.309]  Okay that's a midair refueling as I call it to fund our media operation.
[00:38:58.329 --> 00:39:01.331]  We're not funded by George Soros or the White House like MSNBC.
[00:39:02.612 --> 00:39:11.478]  Or Bloomberg funded by all their insider knowledge and all of his activities with his 15 bodyguards but doesn't want you to be able to own a gun.
[00:39:12.218 --> 00:39:17.262]  He writes yellow journalism pieces about how, quote, I don't build bombs, I build bombers.
[00:39:19.423 --> 00:39:24.184]  I guess if somebody comes up and punches you in the nose, and then you decide to defend yourself, you're a bad guy.
[00:39:24.884 --> 00:39:28.985]  Or if somebody says, hey, it's not right to bully someone, you're inciting them to bomb.
[00:39:29.285 --> 00:39:29.645]  No, I'm not.
[00:39:30.025 --> 00:39:33.866]  I'm inciting people to wake up and take our country back, and that's why you're scared of me.
[00:39:35.467 --> 00:39:36.467]  That's why you're scared.
[00:39:37.247 --> 00:39:39.588]  And you know what, New World Order, I've studied history, so have you.
[00:39:39.908 --> 00:39:40.788]  You should be scared.
[00:39:41.564 --> 00:39:49.372]  You should be scared of all the crimes you've committed and the insanity of thinking that you could ever, ever in a million years get away with what you've done.
[00:39:49.772 --> 00:39:51.934]  Let me give the number out and then I'm going to get into the news.
[00:39:52.195 --> 00:39:53.216]  Let me ask you this question.
[00:39:54.767 --> 00:40:11.259]  Do you think, to use the cliche, that Mr. Edward Snowden, the CIA surveillance tech, and then, again, most of it, over 99% of it, from what I've seen in the funding at least now, is done by private contractors.
[00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:20.466]  The huge cash cow of how he pointed out any analyst can get into your bank account, listen to your phone, you name it.
[00:40:20.506 --> 00:40:22.248]  Yeah, I've talked to FBI agents.
[00:40:23.769 --> 00:40:27.092]  And that was like seven, eight years ago, I talked to an FBI agent.
[00:40:29.134 --> 00:40:34.538]  And then I talked to some federal marshals, a senior one, talked to a whole group of them.
[00:40:34.699 --> 00:40:37.421]  And now I think about, wow, people get arrested for this now.
[00:40:38.842 --> 00:40:46.369]  I mean, I'm on air saying things that they might be bold enough to say, take that man away.
[00:40:49.181 --> 00:40:54.124]  But I remember having a particular FBI agent tell me, Alex, you're absolutely right.
[00:40:54.204 --> 00:40:58.507]  I don't know how you know all this stuff, but the local police don't know it.
[00:41:00.189 --> 00:41:11.857]  But we, the systems that are at the threat fusion centers, waiting to be turned on, can type in your social security number and it will pull up your known group of cell phones.
[00:41:12.517 --> 00:41:14.959]  And then we can hit a button and listen to what you're doing.
[00:41:15.319 --> 00:41:16.460]  We can kill your car.
[00:41:19.557 --> 00:41:27.545]  With the OnStar and ListenToYou, we can turn your phone on even when it's off.
[00:41:28.046 --> 00:41:29.587]  And he goes, but I guess you know all that.
[00:41:29.607 --> 00:41:34.012]  And I'm like, well, yeah, it's in the Telecommunications Act, the money, the infrastructure for it.
[00:41:34.032 --> 00:41:38.656]  And I was visited by a telecommunications whistleblower come to me in 1997.
[00:41:42.227 --> 00:41:43.590]  In fact, I had a whole bunch of them.
[00:41:44.071 --> 00:41:52.648]  I had a whistleblower from Time Warner come to me about the digital cable boxes, an engineer with a degree, an engineering degree from a prestigious university.
[00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:55.782]  You know, one of the head engineers for Time Warner here locally.
[00:41:57.203 --> 00:42:01.105]  I had a telecommunications engineer from a big phone company come to me.
[00:42:01.606 --> 00:42:02.887]  And man, I didn't know what I was reading.
[00:42:03.147 --> 00:42:07.150]  It was specs and boxes, and he said, whatever you do, shred that or burn that.
[00:42:07.210 --> 00:42:07.970]  I threw it in a dumpster.
[00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:10.092]  When you're done, okay?
[00:42:10.532 --> 00:42:15.596]  And these are like engineers with the pocket protectors, you know, like gray-haired guys sweating in parking lots.
[00:42:15.996 --> 00:42:16.896]  And you know, you're...
[00:42:17.797 --> 00:42:34.802]  You're 24 years old, you're 25 years old, and you're like, you know, you go to the library, you go online, you find the confirmations of what they're telling you, and that's why all of you listening go, yeah, you did say 17 years ago, 16 years ago, 10 years ago, everything that's now come out.
[00:42:35.122 --> 00:42:39.824]  Because there were, I had whistleblowers, there was nobody on air talking about this stuff.
[00:42:41.464 --> 00:42:44.045]  Let me tell you, when I had that, when I talked to that Time Warner guy,
[00:42:45.031 --> 00:42:50.296]  And I said, there's microphones listening to you two-way and they're tracking what you watch in psychological profiles.
[00:42:50.697 --> 00:42:53.059]  I mean, I got death threats over that.
[00:42:57.684 --> 00:43:02.809]  I got in the face of a federal judge over a fake trial he was having, and they sent people to beat me up.
[00:43:04.659 --> 00:43:06.901]  And to tell me to shut up while they were punching me in the face.
[00:43:06.921 --> 00:43:13.126]  Of course, I went completely ape hillbilly on them and they didn't like what happened, but I gave a lot better than they gave.
[00:43:13.627 --> 00:43:22.234]  But the point is, is that, is that, let me tell you, this country, I've lived this, ladies and gentlemen, I have lived this.
[00:43:24.235 --> 00:43:31.301]  Where engineers are sitting there at Time Warner Cable in Austin
[00:43:32.475 --> 00:43:34.917]  With two-way cable, with government boxes.
[00:43:35.217 --> 00:43:36.118]  And I said, what do you mean?
[00:43:36.138 --> 00:43:37.659]  He goes, we are the NSA.
[00:43:37.919 --> 00:43:39.140]  There's whole floors.
[00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:40.661]  All, everything.
[00:43:40.681 --> 00:43:41.882]  The microphones are in it.
[00:43:42.082 --> 00:43:42.722]  They're listening.
[00:43:43.163 --> 00:43:44.183]  I can watch the data.
[00:43:44.303 --> 00:43:44.984]  I've got to run it.
[00:43:45.284 --> 00:43:46.325]  It all feeds into them.
[00:43:46.385 --> 00:43:47.125]  We're paid.
[00:43:47.666 --> 00:43:49.207]  Because sometimes they get late paying.
[00:43:49.787 --> 00:43:51.869]  And it's even my job to try to do billing.
[00:43:56.412 --> 00:43:58.593]  That, that Time Warner whistleblower was like in 1997.
[00:44:02.076 --> 00:44:08.006]  And then what happens is you get one whistleblower, and then more whistleblowers come.
[00:44:09.288 --> 00:44:10.910]  And I mean, I was just a kid, folks.
[00:44:13.294 --> 00:44:14.055]  And I'd get a call.
[00:44:14.095 --> 00:44:18.598]  This is Thomas Sanchez, the head of emergency management in Kingsville County.
[00:44:18.699 --> 00:44:20.120]  I'd like you to come down here.
[00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:20.900]  I'd like to meet with you.
[00:44:21.741 --> 00:44:28.326]  Delta Force has come and offered me money, and most of the commissioners have taken money in the county, and they're preparing for martial law.
[00:44:28.367 --> 00:44:37.174]  They say it's a psychological testing program, and I was in intelligence in Vietnam, and this is unpatriotic, and you talk about this, so I want to come on your show.
[00:44:37.694 --> 00:44:38.235]  He came on.
[00:44:38.775 --> 00:44:42.038]  Then, the San Antonio police chief would do an interview if you called him.
[00:44:43.444 --> 00:44:45.845]  And I go down and the San Antonio Police Chief tells me the same thing.
[00:44:46.666 --> 00:44:49.748]  People say, oh, if this was going on, people would blow the whistle.
[00:44:50.008 --> 00:44:52.049]  They do blow the whistle!
[00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:54.711]  They do!
[00:44:57.052 --> 00:44:58.553]  And then nobody did anything.
[00:44:58.873 --> 00:44:59.894]  Nobody stopped it.
[00:45:00.174 --> 00:45:01.315]  Nobody reversed it.
[00:45:01.575 --> 00:45:04.256]  Nobody tried to turn the pendulum back.
[00:45:05.117 --> 00:45:11.901]  And now, folks, the word from people I know high up in banking, I know through a connection,
[00:45:13.829 --> 00:45:26.939]  The president, not the CEO, not the chairman, but the president of one of the big six banks, that there is no way to fix the derivatives.
[00:45:26.979 --> 00:45:27.920]  They did it by design.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:31.703]  It's going to collapse and they are going to take everyone's bank accounts.
[00:45:32.944 --> 00:45:36.487]  I've been telling you that for over a decade and now they're getting ready to do it.
[00:45:38.683 --> 00:45:41.524]  They want you to be completely bankrupted.
[00:45:42.204 --> 00:45:43.625]  They want complete control.
[00:45:44.305 --> 00:45:45.765]  They're all exempt from the taxes.
[00:45:46.025 --> 00:45:49.987]  They're a mafia, ladies and gentlemen, that makes other mafias pale in significance.
[00:45:50.287 --> 00:45:52.087]  So I want to get your take as an audience.
[00:45:52.367 --> 00:45:56.469]  How could anyone call the prism leaker Edward Snowden a traitor?
[00:45:57.409 --> 00:46:02.511]  The people that have allowed this to go on, they're the traitors.
[00:46:03.624 --> 00:46:08.685]  I would tell you in 97 that your digital cable box was listening to you and recording everything in your house.
[00:46:08.985 --> 00:46:09.805]  Now it's all public.
[00:46:11.326 --> 00:46:32.930]  That your TiVo and your Scientific Atlantic box and your Connect, now the Connect fires wireless internet, one of the models, through your house, through walls, and I've even seen the demonstrations, you can pull them up online, and it shows you
[00:46:35.396 --> 00:46:41.938]  Walking around your house, two rooms over, and it can listen to you through your house.
[00:46:43.019 --> 00:46:50.521]  It has audio, it has face scanning, it has wireless, redirected out, scanning through your walls.
[00:46:51.161 --> 00:47:02.485]  It makes a smart meter look primitive, and it's sitting there, data scanning you, made by a eugenicist, made by a globalist, who publicly has said he wants to reduce world population massively.
[00:47:04.915 --> 00:47:10.639]  And young people are paying money to bring this robot into your house.
[00:47:10.659 --> 00:47:11.239]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:12.960]  What university is that?
[00:47:13.881 --> 00:47:14.902]  University of Washington.
[00:47:15.202 --> 00:47:20.245]  Wi-Fi signals enable gesture resignation throughout entire home.
[00:47:21.606 --> 00:47:22.887]  See, they roll it out like a service.
[00:47:23.247 --> 00:47:25.569]  Oh yeah, you'll be able to have hands-free anywhere in the house.
[00:47:26.590 --> 00:47:34.235]  You'll just do an A in the air and it'll recognize that gesture and do an A. You know, let's say your passcode is Ant.
[00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:36.521]  You'll just go, A-N-T.
[00:47:37.121 --> 00:47:40.822]  And see, that all sounds great, except it's two-way!
[00:47:41.123 --> 00:47:43.824]  It's an NSA global kill robot!
[00:47:46.605 --> 00:47:48.486]  This is what you want, this is what you get.
[00:47:54.568 --> 00:48:01.171]  And, and, and, I mean, these are not nice people that want to spy on everyone like angels to end all war and end all problems.
[00:48:01.191 --> 00:48:02.552]  They want you dead!
[00:48:04.229 --> 00:48:05.449]  I was on Man Cow this morning.
[00:48:05.769 --> 00:48:07.250]  He's actually taping it for tomorrow.
[00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:09.250]  He's live a lot, but he taped some segments for the next day.
[00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:10.470]  He was taping it for tomorrow to be technical.
[00:48:10.830 --> 00:48:12.071]  People were like, listen to Man Cow.
[00:48:12.091 --> 00:48:13.271]  You weren't on there.
[00:48:13.311 --> 00:48:14.151]  So it's on tomorrow.
[00:48:14.951 --> 00:48:16.612]  And he was asking, what's at the bottom of the rabbit hole?
[00:48:16.892 --> 00:48:21.073]  And I go, well, they're killing us all with cancer, viruses, SV40, and others, the vaccines, blah, blah, blah.
[00:48:21.113 --> 00:48:24.353]  And it just hits me that this is real.
[00:48:24.493 --> 00:48:25.354]  I'm telling the truth.
[00:48:25.694 --> 00:48:26.434]  This is happening.
[00:48:28.470 --> 00:48:36.921]  I really should be a self-preservation coward, and I should really just either go along with this, or I should just get out of the country and try to go hide.
[00:48:37.141 --> 00:48:43.890]  But when you realize it is a master total takeover plan against all of humanity, and you think about all the innocent children...
[00:48:44.841 --> 00:49:06.433]  I mean I can hardly be in the room now with my innocent good children because it's something beyond rage now when I think about how innocent and good they are and I think about how evil the globalists are that they would commit crimes of this magnitude against humanity and be putting all this stuff in the vaccines on purpose and trying to shovel GMO on kids to hurt little sweet children.
[00:49:12.250 --> 00:49:15.351]  I mean, it's just, it's beyond rage.
[00:49:16.531 --> 00:49:18.372]  I can't look at Dianne Feinstein.
[00:49:18.892 --> 00:49:20.272]  I can't look at Obama.
[00:49:20.732 --> 00:49:21.893]  I can't look at Boehner.
[00:49:22.433 --> 00:49:24.273]  I can't look at any of these people anymore.
[00:49:24.293 --> 00:49:25.734]  They are just scum.
[00:49:26.654 --> 00:49:27.714]  And they're all in on it.
[00:49:28.094 --> 00:49:29.115]  Let me give you a newsflash.
[00:49:29.175 --> 00:49:34.076]  At Speaker of the House level, or at Presidential level, they're in on the club.
[00:49:34.756 --> 00:49:36.077]  You know what's going on at Bilderberg?
[00:49:36.397 --> 00:49:37.937]  Life extension discussions.
[00:49:38.397 --> 00:49:39.638]  And how to keep it from the public.
[00:49:39.938 --> 00:49:40.558]  And what did
[00:49:41.923 --> 00:49:46.567]  Ken Clark, number three in the British government, say, what did Ball say when they gave statements?
[00:49:47.008 --> 00:49:53.794]  They said, we discuss the European Union and global governance and we discuss new medical advances.
[00:49:53.814 --> 00:49:55.456]  They have these wild looks in their eyes.
[00:49:58.599 --> 00:50:03.363]  These pigs think they're going to take the whole world over for themselves and damn us off from the future.
[00:50:04.985 --> 00:50:06.306]  I'm not going to sit around and put up with it.
[00:50:06.326 --> 00:50:06.807]  What about you?
[00:50:08.322 --> 00:50:11.605]  There are things worse than death and turning innocence over.
[00:50:11.926 --> 00:50:23.697]  Anytime I have the shadow of the inkling of fear in the back of my mind, it's not even that, it's more, it's self-centeredness, wanting to see the world, wanting to enjoy beauty, wanting to spend time.
[00:50:24.318 --> 00:50:27.120]  Anytime I have a selfish thought about my life and
[00:50:29.435 --> 00:50:32.358]  Being killed or demonized or any of it, I just think about all the kids.
[00:50:32.638 --> 00:50:39.243]  These people got cornered right now in slave camps, in sex slavery camps, the ones they're killing with vaccines, all of it.
[00:50:39.483 --> 00:50:44.447]  I just think about all those kids they've got, they're hurting right now, and all I want to do is get the New World Order off of them.
[00:50:45.168 --> 00:50:50.433]  A bunch of hyenas tearing kids apart, and all I can think about is charging in and dealing with these people.
[00:50:50.653 --> 00:50:51.914]  But I need your help doing that.
[00:50:51.934 --> 00:50:52.194]  800-259-9231.
[00:50:52.214 --> 00:50:53.415]  Is Snowden a hero or a zero?

[00:52:39.156 --> 00:52:39.956]  Others don't.
[00:52:40.376 --> 00:52:42.257]  We turn jeans inside out.

[00:53:26.029 --> 00:53:26.189]  I think?
[00:53:50.984 --> 00:53:51.666]  We're good to go.
[00:54:21.075 --> 00:54:23.056]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:54:23.176 --> 00:54:23.696]  to 2 p.m.
[00:54:23.716 --> 00:54:24.136]  Central.
[00:54:25.136 --> 00:54:25.877]  We're here live.
[00:54:26.317 --> 00:54:39.921]  By the way, the NSA was listening to everything pre 9-11 and Sybil Edmonds was working for the FBI on NSA intercepts and she's broken her gag order.
[00:54:40.973 --> 00:54:45.114]  She told Congress all of this, and most of it's come out separately confirming what she said.
[00:54:45.934 --> 00:54:51.796]  She said they were running drugs, guns, Al-Qaeda, commanding Osama bin Laden.
[00:54:51.916 --> 00:54:59.078]  They were listening to the CIA command bin Laden and command the hijackers in what they thought was a drill.
[00:54:59.758 --> 00:55:01.218]  And they were running white slaves.
[00:55:01.318 --> 00:55:05.459]  And I always get idiots sending me emails saying, well don't you care about black slavery?
[00:55:05.739 --> 00:55:07.540]  White slavery means sex slaves, folks.
[00:55:08.717 --> 00:55:09.277]  For new listeners.
[00:55:09.957 --> 00:55:10.978]  I mean, she's on record.
[00:55:10.998 --> 00:55:13.238]  I'm going to explain to you again.
[00:55:13.518 --> 00:55:15.599]  They're not spying on you to keep you safe.
[00:55:16.039 --> 00:55:19.740]  They're spying on you to make sure they can snatch kids out of your backyard and get away with it.
[00:55:21.121 --> 00:55:21.321]  Okay?
[00:55:21.861 --> 00:55:22.301]  Alright, good.
[00:55:23.301 --> 00:55:25.402]  They don't just chase the pages around at the Capitol.
[00:55:25.442 --> 00:55:29.743]  They don't just, you know, have all these diplomats getting caught with ten-year-old girls.
[00:55:30.323 --> 00:55:31.683]  No, no.
[00:55:31.743 --> 00:55:33.184]  That's kind of light stuff.
[00:55:36.093 --> 00:55:39.775]  You don't get in the higher echelons unless you like to club little kids' heads in.
[00:55:40.515 --> 00:55:42.756]  And, you know, I'm sorry if you want to hear all this.
[00:55:43.016 --> 00:55:45.197]  They already say babies that aren't born aren't humans.
[00:55:45.518 --> 00:55:47.619]  They killed 53 million of them so far.
[00:55:48.899 --> 00:55:51.360]  And by illustrating that they're doing it, we can stop it.
[00:55:51.541 --> 00:55:56.343]  By going, you know that nine-month-old baby that you're strangling or throwing in the toilet to drown?
[00:55:56.563 --> 00:55:58.224]  That's murder, and you're going to jail.
[00:55:59.909 --> 00:56:01.010]  How dare you extremist?
[00:56:01.230 --> 00:56:02.290]  No, I'm not an extremist.
[00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:02.970]  I have a heart.
[00:56:03.311 --> 00:56:07.893]  Other people are going to join me, and we're going to have grand juries indict you, and we're going to put you under the jail.
[00:56:08.153 --> 00:56:09.474]  How's that sound, New World Order?
[00:56:11.575 --> 00:56:12.215]  How's that sound?
[00:56:12.535 --> 00:56:28.563]  See, we know who you are, and I'm aware of what you're doing, and I see you, and I'm going to make sure everybody else sees you, and we're going to get our hands legally and lawfully through the court system when we take this country back around your throat.
[00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:31.062]  With a rope.
[00:56:33.910 --> 00:56:37.882]  And there's gonna be rejoicing when your neck snapped at the end of that thing.
[00:56:39.198 --> 00:56:41.099]  So you better do everything.
[00:56:41.499 --> 00:56:43.240]  Go ahead, come after me, whatever you're going to do.
[00:56:43.480 --> 00:56:44.461]  I'm coming for you!
[00:56:44.801 --> 00:56:46.382]  You understand that, murderers?
[00:56:46.842 --> 00:56:47.963]  I'm coming for you!
[00:56:47.983 --> 00:56:51.845]  I know who you are, putting cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[00:56:52.385 --> 00:56:53.726]  This is the reality, folks.
[00:56:53.906 --> 00:56:55.527]  We beat them by being hardcore.
[00:56:55.727 --> 00:56:58.208]  We beat them by going all the way and saying who they really are.
[00:56:58.468 --> 00:57:00.369]  We don't beat them by eating around the edges.
[00:57:00.629 --> 00:57:03.811]  We don't beat them by, oh, why are you targeting the Tea Party?
[00:57:04.011 --> 00:57:05.132]  Why are you targeting the press?
[00:57:06.684 --> 00:57:08.165]  We beat him by blowing the whistle.
[00:57:08.405 --> 00:57:09.767]  We beat him by going all the way.
[00:57:09.987 --> 00:57:11.508]  We beat him by standing up to him.
[00:57:12.289 --> 00:57:13.930]  We beat him by seeing what they're doing.
[00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:16.132]  Let's go to a quick clip of Ron Paul.
[00:57:19.294 --> 00:57:24.999]  Quick clip of Ron Paul talking about how he hopes that the government doesn't send a drone to kill Snowden.
[00:57:25.279 --> 00:57:25.820]  No, they won't do that.
[00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:33.386]  They'll throw a bag over his head, take him and torture him for a couple months, and then promise to kill his family if he doesn't come out and say he was a Chinese spy.
[00:57:34.267 --> 00:57:34.827]  That's what they'll do.
[00:57:34.867 --> 00:57:35.468]  Let's go to the tape.
[00:57:36.433 --> 00:57:37.474]  Where do you think he is right now?
[00:57:37.534 --> 00:57:38.354]  Are you worried about that?
[00:57:38.374 --> 00:57:39.834]  I have no idea.
[00:57:40.415 --> 00:57:47.517]  Yeah, I'm worried about somebody in our government might kill him with a cruise missile or a drone missile.
[00:57:47.857 --> 00:57:54.140]  I mean, we live in a bad time where American citizens don't even have rights and that they can be killed.
[00:57:55.382 --> 00:57:59.323]  The gentleman is trying to tell the truth about what's going on.
[00:57:59.383 --> 00:58:00.824]  He's not defecting.
[00:58:00.844 --> 00:58:02.724]  There's no signs of that happening.
[00:58:03.245 --> 00:58:08.446]  It's a shame that we're in an age where people who tell the truth about what the government's doing gets into trouble.
[00:58:11.027 --> 00:58:15.008]  And then Rand Paul has come out and said, well, yeah, Congress was brief.
[00:58:15.028 --> 00:58:16.169]  We were given gag orders.
[00:58:16.669 --> 00:58:20.410]  But at least he's saying arrest the people that are illegally doing all this.
[00:58:22.031 --> 00:58:22.971]  Yes, arrest them.
[00:58:24.554 --> 00:58:32.742]  I mean, you take one look at Hayden, you take one look at all these people, I mean, these are sickos in blue suits.
[00:58:34.444 --> 00:58:37.286]  I mean, I am not bowing down to these people anymore, folks.
[00:58:38.107 --> 00:58:38.488]  Okay?
[00:58:38.508 --> 00:58:48.037]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:52.915 --> 00:58:54.237]  Hello, this is Steve Schenck.
[00:58:54.557 --> 00:59:00.584]  Alex and I want to thank you for the generous support of the Oklahoma food donations pouring in every day.
[00:59:00.984 --> 00:59:03.587]  In just six days, over 37,000 servings have been shipped.
[00:59:03.607 --> 00:59:05.169]  Your $25 and a subsidy from eFoodsDirect.
[00:59:09.173 --> 00:59:12.636]  We'll send a seven-day supply of food to someone in need.
[00:59:12.976 --> 00:59:16.558]  Please keep Oklahoma important, but we've got serious food issues.
[00:59:16.919 --> 00:59:27.406]  For example, the rising cost of food, especially beef, last year's worst drought in 50 years, and the mandated ethanol production has dried up the feed supply for livestock.
[00:59:27.786 --> 00:59:31.769]  Chinese are offering $4.7 billion to buy our largest pork producer.
[00:59:32.149 --> 00:59:37.573]  Find out more and get the one solution you can count on at efoodsdirect.com slash alex.
[00:59:37.933 --> 00:59:38.414]  We're good to go.
[01:00:06.158 --> 01:00:10.340]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:11.801]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.581 --> 01:00:13.502]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:14.122 --> 01:00:17.684]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.324 --> 01:00:22.386]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:36.161 --> 01:00:39.845]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now into our number two.
[01:00:39.865 --> 01:00:41.226]  I'm going to be taking your phone calls.
[01:00:41.246 --> 01:00:42.468]  I've got a bunch of audio clips.
[01:00:43.048 --> 01:00:50.696]  We're going to be getting into Obama's going ahead with carbon taxes outside of Congress that are paid directly to him and Al Gore and others.
[01:00:50.796 --> 01:00:52.618]  It's just unbelievably outrageous.
[01:00:53.639 --> 01:00:57.102]  That's being reported by Bloomberg, who of course has been promoting it, and must be very happy.
[01:00:57.122 --> 01:01:00.925]  Obama quietly raises carbon prices, costs the climate increase.
[01:01:02.066 --> 01:01:09.152]  Look how Bloomberg reports it, like, if there's a storm, it's because you didn't pay Bloomberg or Al Gore that pig Obama money.
[01:01:10.073 --> 01:01:13.075]  By pig, just like, up there, they even act like they're communists.
[01:01:13.095 --> 01:01:13.956]  They're not even communists.
[01:01:13.976 --> 01:01:18.860]  There's these globalist kleptocrats who walk around annihilating all businesses they don't own.
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:19.861]  It's just disgusting.
[01:01:20.501 --> 01:01:21.542]  Disgusting filth.
[01:01:22.283 --> 01:01:28.872]  Continuing here, DHS funded exercise portrays free American citizens as terrorist cell.
[01:01:29.192 --> 01:01:30.594]  This is our top story today.
[01:01:31.255 --> 01:01:35.701]  And I get so wound up on the other news I got into, I didn't cover this in the first hour.
[01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:37.601]  This is our top story.
[01:01:38.041 --> 01:01:38.902]  This is huge.
[01:01:39.082 --> 01:01:39.862]  This is big.
[01:01:40.343 --> 01:01:45.626]  And I want to also ask the crew in there, I want you to go into this article and print me the Boston Globe that came with it.
[01:01:46.066 --> 01:01:50.049]  It's at the bottom of the second paragraph, so you can show people it's in the Boston Globe.
[01:01:50.889 --> 01:02:04.978]  A couple months before the bombing, they were going to have a drill where the Tea Party bombs the public on a public street in Boston with backpack bombs.
[01:02:07.514 --> 01:02:12.076]  Oh boy, and that way if any of their operatives get caught doing it, they just say, oh, it's part of the drill.
[01:02:12.096 --> 01:02:13.616]  Doesn't that work?
[01:02:13.796 --> 01:02:30.482]  Like Sweden, and of course they were, a few days after going to blame the tea party, they said it's a tea partier, they've got him, he's at the courthouse, they're going to release the news, and then, thank God, we got photos of the drill and all the rest of it, and the witnesses, and then they had to back off and I guess burn some of their, they always have backup groups to burn.
[01:02:32.113 --> 01:02:33.954]  So the brothers were out partying and having a great time.
[01:02:33.974 --> 01:02:35.354]  They thought, hey, we're in the CIA.
[01:02:35.374 --> 01:02:36.054]  This is awesome.
[01:02:36.775 --> 01:02:37.615]  You know, they were in the CIA.
[01:02:37.975 --> 01:02:38.555]  They were funded.
[01:02:38.795 --> 01:02:39.556]  They were operatives.
[01:02:39.596 --> 01:02:40.276]  They were idiots.
[01:02:40.316 --> 01:02:43.617]  They were, I mean, according to the CIA, they were useful idiots.
[01:02:44.077 --> 01:02:44.737]  And they were shut up.
[01:02:45.658 --> 01:02:46.578]  There's no doubting that.
[01:02:46.618 --> 01:02:48.879]  They're killing all the witnesses around them.
[01:02:48.899 --> 01:02:52.060]  But I'm crazy to look at that.
[01:02:52.580 --> 01:02:53.220]  I'm nuts.
[01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:54.921]  But that's not even the angle.
[01:02:55.021 --> 01:02:56.681]  Our article doesn't even get into all that.
[01:02:57.341 --> 01:02:58.182]  It gets into
[01:02:59.301 --> 01:03:22.439]  They were having a drill that was scheduled for next month, that was booked, whatever it was, three months ago, a few months before the bombing, of the Tea Party-type right-wing group that wears an American flag, Uncle Sam hat, that's the symbol of it, and they were going to blow up the people, just like I was able to dig up
[01:03:24.538 --> 01:03:33.347]  The articles a few months ago, and it was back in the news where they're training all over the country, that the homeschoolers are going to attack the public schools.
[01:03:33.427 --> 01:03:33.707]  Yes!
[01:03:34.588 --> 01:03:40.254]  And they have drills unannounced where they traumatize the children, telling them all that this is coming.
[01:03:41.295 --> 01:03:48.642]  So when we come back from break, we're going to go to Ron and Robert and Regina and Chris and Aaron and many others that are patiently holding
[01:03:50.247 --> 01:03:55.649]  Then I'm going to get into this top story, and then I'm going to get into Obama's minion.
[01:03:55.709 --> 01:04:00.690]  Biden warns GOP, led by two young senators, Ted Cruz and Rand Paul.
[01:04:02.351 --> 01:04:04.332]  And he warned in the speech, they won't work with us.
[01:04:04.352 --> 01:04:05.112]  They're dangerous.
[01:04:05.412 --> 01:04:08.173]  We've got to stop them, these Tea Party people, being elected.
[01:04:08.413 --> 01:04:12.654]  See, that's real Tea Party, not the fake Tea Party the Republicans tried to co-opt.
[01:04:13.975 --> 01:04:17.316]  Let me tell you, how do you know Rand Paul is good and Ted Cruz are good?
[01:04:18.257 --> 01:04:23.419]  Because the Republican leadership and the Democratic leadership have tried to do everything they can to bring him down.
[01:04:24.759 --> 01:04:32.942]  And whenever Biden's talking to his biggest supporters and millionaire donors, all he's doing is whining 24-7 about Rand Paul.
[01:04:33.502 --> 01:04:35.863]  Because they've got Rand Paul's phones tapped, folks.
[01:04:35.883 --> 01:04:37.623]  They know Rand Paul is a patriot.
[01:04:38.704 --> 01:04:41.245]  Ted Cruz, I don't know him well, so I don't know if I can trust him.
[01:04:41.625 --> 01:04:42.325]  I like what I see.
[01:04:44.113 --> 01:04:46.034]  And so, there you go.
[01:04:46.074 --> 01:04:49.255]  But I know Rand Paul's for real, as good as it gets.
[01:04:50.276 --> 01:04:53.137]  And they know he's been playing them, not the other way around.
[01:04:55.798 --> 01:04:56.579]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:56.619 --> 01:04:57.159]  Stay with us.

[01:07:04.166 --> 01:07:08.992]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:07:09.173 --> 01:07:16.362]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[01:07:16.482 --> 01:07:21.906]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[01:07:22.127 --> 01:07:25.850]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.

[01:07:58.214 --> 01:07:58.614]  Are you?
[01:07:58.875 --> 01:07:59.655]  InfoWarshop.com
[01:08:06.294 --> 01:08:10.495]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:08:11.115 --> 01:08:11.936]  You want answers?
[01:08:12.696 --> 01:08:13.596]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:14.256 --> 01:08:17.877]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:18.437 --> 01:08:22.558]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:24.799 --> 01:08:26.039]  Here's some of the headlines.
[01:08:26.099 --> 01:08:27.600]  You can't make this stuff up.
[01:08:28.669 --> 01:08:41.524]  DHS funded exercise portrays free American citizens, that's a quote, Tea Partiers, as terrorist cells who they are training might commit a Boston bombing.
[01:08:42.725 --> 01:08:48.932]  Branding of the Tea Party as violent extremist accelerates, I'd say so, in that big cover story in Bloomberg.
[01:08:49.969 --> 01:08:55.891]  Just a few days ago, they say, quote, Alex Jones doesn't build bombs, he builds bombers.
[01:08:55.931 --> 01:09:03.355]  When I call for non-violence outside of a jury, you know, finding an axe murderer guilty and executing him.
[01:09:03.375 --> 01:09:06.196]  I mean, I'm for due process, and everybody knows that.
[01:09:07.556 --> 01:09:11.818]  But I am trying to rile the people up to the open tyranny to take our country back.
[01:09:11.898 --> 01:09:18.881]  And if tyrants try to oppress us or ship us off to a FEMA camp, well, you know, we got the Second Amendment for that, and that's on my right.
[01:09:20.319 --> 01:09:26.601]  The globalists are using our money to arm to the teeth and spy on us and de-industrialize us.
[01:09:26.701 --> 01:09:27.341]  It's incredible.
[01:09:27.941 --> 01:09:28.802]  So that's coming up.
[01:09:28.822 --> 01:09:30.382]  I'm going to get to the big news too.
[01:09:31.002 --> 01:09:33.243]  Obama quietly raises carbon prices.
[01:09:33.323 --> 01:09:34.984]  Cost to climate increased.
[01:09:36.364 --> 01:09:37.725]  I mean, what do you say about a headline?
[01:09:37.745 --> 01:09:39.465]  They say a picture can tell a thousand words?
[01:09:40.045 --> 01:09:44.647]  I could write a book off that treasonous Bloomberg Decepticon headline.
[01:09:48.604 --> 01:09:58.007]  It's illegal for Obama, in a regulation, to raise the price when Congress hasn't even passed carbon taxes, but they already had them in there.
[01:09:58.307 --> 01:10:10.691]  Now he's raised it, but then gives waivers to all his friends, and then he sits on the boards and has massive stock in the Chicago Climate Carbon Exchange.
[01:10:12.511 --> 01:10:14.532]  And then Gore owns the London Exchange!
[01:10:16.621 --> 01:10:17.822]  It's called gore and blood.
[01:10:17.982 --> 01:10:18.702]  That's not a pun.
[01:10:19.103 --> 01:10:20.744]  The other partners named blood.
[01:10:21.864 --> 01:10:22.285]  Look it up.
[01:10:22.345 --> 01:10:23.005]  I'm not joking.
[01:10:26.007 --> 01:10:28.429]  And if they can force this through, it is a tax to them.
[01:10:28.689 --> 01:10:29.049]  Why not?
[01:10:29.069 --> 01:10:31.611]  They take Europeans' bank accounts and give it to private bankers.
[01:10:32.511 --> 01:10:40.937]  We pay $85 billion a month going up on the national debt that's more than doubled since Obama got in to give to foreign banks and Congress is told, sit down and shut up.
[01:10:40.957 --> 01:10:42.558]  We're not going to tell you where that money's going.
[01:10:44.844 --> 01:10:50.831]  Yeah, it's $85 billion a month, but we're not going to tell you Congress who gets it.
[01:10:51.311 --> 01:10:52.473]  Sit down and shut up.
[01:10:52.513 --> 01:10:56.417]  No, Congress is just over the power of the purse, but that's just the Constitution.
[01:10:57.358 --> 01:10:59.160]  Just a bleeping piece of paper.
[01:11:00.562 --> 01:11:01.743]  Yeah, there's another Bloomberg article.
[01:11:02.063 --> 01:11:06.248]  Gore and blood linked CO2 to subprime debt.
[01:11:11.775 --> 01:11:12.795]  Isn't that just special?
[01:11:13.136 --> 01:11:21.139]  Yeah, Bloomberg though is not telling you now, Obama raises the price of the collapsing carbon market to line his pockets.
[01:11:22.980 --> 01:11:26.722]  Or Obama raises price of direct tax to him!
[01:11:30.523 --> 01:11:36.566]  And then, you know, the headlines got more because it says, Obama quietly raises carbon price
[01:11:38.448 --> 01:11:43.931]  You could write a book about that statement, and then after it, as cost to climate increases.
[01:11:44.752 --> 01:11:58.119]  You know, because Bloomberg says it's the science that carbon dioxide that we exhale is heating the planet, even though the science is the opposite, and they've been proven to be known frauds and their emails are public.
[01:11:58.560 --> 01:11:59.100]  Doesn't matter.
[01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:00.261]  Bloomberg says
[01:12:01.272 --> 01:12:02.753]  As the cost to the climate.
[01:12:03.233 --> 01:12:11.859]  He says carbon dioxide out of coal power plants is a toxic waste and it's hurting the earth because they wave their magic wand and that's the way it is.
[01:12:13.140 --> 01:12:15.742]  And so you need to sit down and you need to shut up.
[01:12:17.363 --> 01:12:20.205]  And then the idiots go, what do you work for the oil companies?
[01:12:20.605 --> 01:12:23.948]  Most of the big oil companies, Dutch Rochelle, BP,
[01:12:26.854 --> 01:12:33.259]  The only one that didn't 100% go along was Exxon Mobil, and then five years ago, Rex Tillerson, the board meeting was broken up.
[01:12:33.679 --> 01:12:36.241]  David Rockefeller showed up and he said, you will be removed right now.
[01:12:36.381 --> 01:12:43.086]  I'm the owner of this company and the other big six or seven companies that were broken up under Standard Oil, still the owner, they just broke them up.
[01:12:43.766 --> 01:12:46.328]  You are fired right now, Tillerson, if you don't do this.
[01:12:46.909 --> 01:12:48.129]  By the way, that was in the news.
[01:12:50.311 --> 01:12:53.633]  Type in Rex Tillerson, David Rockefeller, click web, you can pull it up.
[01:12:54.853 --> 01:12:58.674]  North Carolina newspaper reported on it because the meeting was in North Carolina.
[01:12:59.054 --> 01:13:05.696]  The point is, is that it's the oil companies lobbying to shut off coal.
[01:13:05.796 --> 01:13:06.857]  Gee, I wonder why.
[01:13:08.517 --> 01:13:10.978]  Coal's 52% of the energy in this country.
[01:13:12.838 --> 01:13:17.600]  They can use coal in some of the processes to make diesel.
[01:13:18.894 --> 01:13:22.836]  So if they do shut down all the oil and then try to jack up prices, they can go to that.
[01:13:23.396 --> 01:13:26.898]  It's got a bunch of other distillates used that oil competes with.
[01:13:27.158 --> 01:13:29.199]  So let me explain something to all you morons out there.
[01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:32.361]  I get zero money from oil.
[01:13:33.041 --> 01:13:34.982]  Zero money from gas.
[01:13:35.843 --> 01:13:45.908]  I've got family, you know, in East Texas, they got these tiny, you know, like where the neighbor has a gas well that pumps so much and then, you know, you get a $500 check a month or something.
[01:13:46.530 --> 01:13:50.071]  And by the way, it's the gas companies that lobby against coal as well.
[01:13:50.251 --> 01:13:55.253]  So if I was, I've never got any money from it, but if I was, I would lobby for natural gas.
[01:13:55.293 --> 01:13:56.573]  It's actually a pretty good fuel as well.
[01:13:57.173 --> 01:14:03.535]  I mean, separately, but I would be lobbying against coal because I guess I've got connections to natural gas.
[01:14:03.616 --> 01:14:07.877]  But the issue I'm getting at here, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:20.784]  Is that it's come out in lawsuits that Big Oil, by and large, not the local wildcatters and people, but Big Oil, they want to shut down their competition.
[01:14:20.904 --> 01:14:21.404]  Duh!
[01:14:22.344 --> 01:14:22.865]  Duh!
[01:14:25.105 --> 01:14:32.528]  And General Electric wants it shut down because they got, three years ago, a waiver, look it up, from Obama, where they can put out whatever they want out of their smokestacks.
[01:14:32.768 --> 01:14:37.910]  Their competition can't even put water vapor and carbon dioxide out now without having to pay
[01:14:40.683 --> 01:14:42.984]  One of five different global exchanges.
[01:14:45.285 --> 01:14:46.186]  Private people.
[01:14:46.226 --> 01:14:50.188]  You have to go buy it from Al the Pig Gore.
[01:14:50.648 --> 01:14:52.569]  From the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers.
[01:14:53.249 --> 01:14:54.990]  And then it's all selectively enforced.
[01:14:55.390 --> 01:14:59.352]  And then I just can't get over the dumb hippie types who aren't bad people.
[01:14:59.772 --> 01:15:01.873]  They're not Malthusian eugenicists scum.
[01:15:01.913 --> 01:15:02.613]  They mean well.
[01:15:03.334 --> 01:15:09.857]  But they're so ignorant, they really don't understand that 51% of our energy consumption is coal.
[01:15:14.637 --> 01:15:17.478]  And that if they shut that down, we're dead in the water.
[01:15:18.599 --> 01:15:24.762]  Meanwhile, the globalists have heavily invested in China, where they build three new plants a week.
[01:15:24.802 --> 01:15:27.483]  Strangely enough, we shut down on average more than three a week.
[01:15:29.424 --> 01:15:35.868]  So, our power's being turned off for factories, for your home, you know, the prices go up.
[01:15:36.368 --> 01:15:38.169]  I mean, you've seen the price of energy go up.
[01:15:39.164 --> 01:15:41.945]  If you plug your electric car in, it's coming from coal most of the time.
[01:15:42.245 --> 01:15:42.846]  That's going up.
[01:15:43.046 --> 01:15:45.087]  They're tearing down the dams, the hydroelectrics.
[01:15:45.447 --> 01:15:48.268]  We're being conquered economically.
[01:15:48.868 --> 01:15:50.529]  And it's on record they're doing this.
[01:15:50.889 --> 01:15:51.810]  And then look at these headlines.
[01:15:51.830 --> 01:15:53.331]  I'm going to cover this down, then come back and go to break.
[01:15:53.571 --> 01:15:54.291]  Look at these headlines.
[01:15:55.011 --> 01:15:55.772]  CNBC.
[01:15:57.332 --> 01:16:02.675]  Students are clamoring for fossil fuel divestment.
[01:16:03.851 --> 01:16:17.504]  And they have the universities owned by big megaconglomerates, tax-free families, come to them and then have all the students clamor and have rallies that are university-sponsored to have the pension funds and the school endowments divest.
[01:16:18.345 --> 01:16:21.128]  And when you hear fossil fuel, it ain't oil, folks, mainly.
[01:16:22.029 --> 01:16:25.192]  It is in the coal units of those.
[01:16:28.393 --> 01:16:32.477]  And of course, foreigners like the communist Chinese, they snap up those stocks immediately.
[01:16:32.877 --> 01:16:39.744]  In fact, I saw a study out a month ago that actually this divestment is just making the stock go up because the stock had always been locked up.
[01:16:39.784 --> 01:16:40.584]  People wouldn't sell it.
[01:16:40.825 --> 01:16:41.966]  There's only so much of it.
[01:16:42.026 --> 01:16:44.688]  So now, you know, it's actually getting out there into the market.
[01:16:46.150 --> 01:16:50.514]  You think that drive it down, but actually driving it up, making interest as people go, Oh, I can get that now.
[01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:55.923]  It's kind of like when they, you know, sell out of something at the grocery store and it comes back in or everybody rushes in to get it.
[01:16:56.604 --> 01:17:06.771]  But, I mean, just talk about useful idiot morons running around going, I want to save the atmosphere, shut off the coal plants when our plants are clean as a whistle.
[01:17:08.452 --> 01:17:14.357]  And look, they're suppressing all sorts of better energy systems, but they're not letting those roll out.
[01:17:14.417 --> 01:17:15.718]  I mean, I'm telling you folks,
[01:17:17.233 --> 01:17:19.136]  Texas was just energy dependent four years ago.
[01:17:19.156 --> 01:17:24.824]  We've got to buy a bunch of our power from Mexico now, and it's totally dirty, stacks, one mile over the border.
[01:17:25.044 --> 01:17:25.445]  Look it up.
[01:17:27.888 --> 01:17:30.932]  So, buried in a little-noticed rule,
[01:17:32.330 --> 01:17:36.471]  Saddle Bloomberg, on microwave ovens is a change in the U.S.
[01:17:36.511 --> 01:17:38.232]  government's accounting for carbon emissions.
[01:17:38.772 --> 01:17:40.192]  Oh, it's just an accounting thing, you know.
[01:17:40.512 --> 01:17:42.033]  Stroke of the pen, law of the land, kind of cool.
[01:17:42.513 --> 01:17:48.354]  That could have wide-ranging implications for everything from power plants to the Keystone XL pipeline.
[01:17:49.054 --> 01:17:51.395]  The increase of the so-called social cost of carbon.
[01:17:51.695 --> 01:17:52.615]  See, it just says that.
[01:17:52.895 --> 01:17:57.677]  It just says, again, stating it's a fact that it's hurting the earth, to $38 a metric ton
[01:18:00.421 --> 01:18:05.862]  From 2380, adjust the calculation the government uses to weigh costs and benefits of proposed regulations.
[01:18:05.902 --> 01:18:13.985]  The figure is meant to approximate losses from global warming, again, as if it's a fact, such as flood damage and diminished crops.
[01:18:14.005 --> 01:18:23.387]  And then they have a huge secret geoengineering program that's admitted to exist, which, we talked to all the meteorologists, is designed to screw the country up.
[01:18:23.547 --> 01:18:25.288]  I mean, we're under total siege attack.
[01:18:25.548 --> 01:18:29.669]  America's being conquered right now, so we collapse into the arms of the collectivist government.
[01:18:30.404 --> 01:18:48.567]  Just like Stalin turned off, you know, the power, the gas, the coal mines, and then wouldn't let people plant crops and had secret police running around burning them for a decade in Ukraine, Poland, and a bunch of other countries until everybody collapsed and went into collectivized farms that were basically gulags.
[01:18:54.168 --> 01:18:59.649]  The Great Leap Forward, the Cultural Revolution of Mao Zedong, all CIA run, now declassified.
[01:19:00.626 --> 01:19:10.872]  Sixty-six to eighty-four million, nobody knows the number, the Chinese say eighty-something million, killed under a CIA, Ford Foundation-managed operation.
[01:19:11.872 --> 01:19:18.176]  And the Chinese finally figured this out and arrested his wife and then Mao was, you know, disappeared basically and they said he just died.
[01:19:19.966 --> 01:19:21.287]  The commies don't even like mail.
[01:19:21.828 --> 01:19:27.772]  Only David Rockefeller wrote an obituary in the New York Times saying he did a great job and we need to live like them.
[01:19:28.313 --> 01:19:31.575]  Our criminal government put the greatest mass murder in history in power.
[01:19:31.875 --> 01:19:32.956]  That's now on record.
[01:19:34.017 --> 01:19:34.237]  Okay?
[01:19:35.698 --> 01:19:38.401]  Now after they shut everybody down, then they'll turn stuff back on.
[01:19:40.843 --> 01:19:43.104]  But the point is, they're shutting everything off right now.
[01:19:44.325 --> 01:19:44.866]  Alright, I'm done.
[01:19:44.906 --> 01:19:46.127]  I promise I'm going to your calls.
[01:19:47.577 --> 01:19:49.618]  Ron and everybody else on the other side of this quick break.
[01:19:49.638 --> 01:19:50.058]  800-259-99231.
[01:19:50.778 --> 01:19:52.679]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:19:53.639 --> 01:19:54.820]  And this is the InfoWar.
[01:19:54.860 --> 01:19:57.001]  And I'm here to try to save this country and save the planet.
[01:19:57.481 --> 01:19:58.902]  And I need your help to do it.
[01:19:58.942 --> 01:19:59.722]  We can do it together.
[01:20:01.752 --> 01:20:05.254]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:20:05.414 --> 01:20:09.375]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:20:09.696 --> 01:20:11.156]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:20:11.476 --> 01:20:19.060]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[01:20:19.340 --> 01:20:20.200]  But for how long?
[01:20:20.481 --> 01:20:26.743]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[01:20:27.104 --> 01:20:29.925]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[01:20:31.175 --> 01:20:40.441]  We the people grow cotton, wheat fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[01:20:40.501 --> 01:20:41.222]  This capitalism?
[01:20:41.282 --> 01:20:47.426]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:20:47.566 --> 01:20:48.326]  Hi, Ted Anderson.

[01:21:30.564 --> 01:21:37.388]  Last year's worst drought in 50 years, and the mandated ethanol production has dried up the feed supply for livestock.
[01:21:37.748 --> 01:21:41.691]  Chinese are offering $4.7 billion to buy our largest pork producer.

[01:24:04.850 --> 01:24:10.891]  By the way, after I take your calls, we're going to have an NSA whistleblower himself on the broadcast.
[01:24:10.931 --> 01:24:20.474]  Wayne Madsen will continue with calls after that as well, but the crew, neurotically, and that's because I've told them to do it, just searches everything I say, every claim I make.
[01:24:20.934 --> 01:24:23.895]  Which is good, because sometimes I call a river the wrong name.
[01:24:24.095 --> 01:24:25.295]  The Thames is the Thames.
[01:24:25.756 --> 01:24:26.816]  My brain scrambles things.
[01:24:29.158 --> 01:24:36.763]  But they pulled up the 1970s New York Times article with David Rockefeller praising Mao Zedong for his obituary.
[01:24:38.765 --> 01:24:42.287]  And they'll print that off, I'll be able to read that later on the broadcast.
[01:24:42.307 --> 01:24:44.088]  Yeah, August 10th, 1973.
[01:24:45.149 --> 01:24:49.412]  He talks about how great Mao was and no one can deny how fabulous his form of government is.
[01:24:49.432 --> 01:24:52.154]  This is from one of the richest men in the world.
[01:24:56.118 --> 01:24:57.118]  Yeah, it's an honor to be on your show.
[01:24:57.158 --> 01:24:59.199]  I have three quick points, but first for new listeners,
[01:25:21.134 --> 01:25:40.931]  I want to make it a point that you need to listen to Alex Jones Show for a good month to really, if you just pick a day, you might come off as, you know, a lunatic or something, but give it time and it'll sink in and you'll verify the things that he's saying are true.
[01:25:40.951 --> 01:25:42.012]  Well, Ron, let me say this.
[01:25:42.112 --> 01:25:44.074]  I mean, in a way, I am a lunatic.
[01:25:44.614 --> 01:25:49.540]  Because it'd be like if I was in Nazi Germany watching them exterminate people, I would freak out.
[01:25:49.860 --> 01:25:55.847]  If I was watching the Romans crucify thousands of Christians for no reason, I would be freaking out.
[01:25:56.428 --> 01:26:00.413]  If I was watching Stalin kill people, I would be freaking out.
[01:26:00.913 --> 01:26:01.694]  Because crazy...
[01:26:02.648 --> 01:26:04.869]  Nowadays is doing something outside the norm.
[01:26:05.369 --> 01:26:15.674]  And so because I am upset about this, and I tell it like it is, and the general public has been told it's fun to live under this, I am crazy by modern definitions.
[01:26:15.714 --> 01:26:16.034]  Go ahead.
[01:26:16.877 --> 01:26:28.085]  Yes, everybody needs to get desensitized to the things that you're talking about so, you know, you don't get nervous and they are true and they are here to stay.
[01:26:28.746 --> 01:26:35.491]  My first point was I was watching C-SPAN this morning and Republican Sanchez, the lady from California,
[01:26:36.051 --> 01:26:48.782]  She was saying what a joke it was that, you know, every time they get permission to do what they want to do, whether it be Department of Homeland Security or whatever, because she said
[01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:56.925]  First, I have to get permission to get like a specialized room that, you know, it's a clean room, no bugs or whatever.
[01:26:57.306 --> 01:27:00.008]  So I have to get permission to get that room.
[01:27:00.348 --> 01:27:01.849]  Then I have to schedule it.
[01:27:02.389 --> 01:27:08.994]  And then the person I want to interview probably can't make that schedule.
[01:27:09.374 --> 01:27:12.877]  And then when we do agree, they don't show up.
[01:27:13.117 --> 01:27:26.464]  Yeah, for those that don't know, Congress has had all of its authority taken and given to foreign corporations that now run all the intelligence, and they won't tell the committee chairman of the Homeland Security Committee what's in PDD 51.
[01:27:27.004 --> 01:27:31.327]  But the summary page says what's in it, and the orders of the Pentagon say what it is.
[01:27:31.787 --> 01:27:35.849]  It's a plan to arrest 50 million Americans and put us in forced labor camps.
[01:27:36.409 --> 01:27:41.472]  So see, even though the stuff's classified at the top, the manifestation of it is not classified.
[01:27:42.179 --> 01:27:42.700]  The street?
[01:28:01.457 --> 01:28:03.178]  The federal government doesn't do that.
[01:28:03.458 --> 01:28:12.461]  They just say, oh, it's a change based on Article 15 of some section, and then you've got to look that up to see what the difference is.
[01:28:12.701 --> 01:28:13.442]  It's a joke.
[01:28:13.722 --> 01:28:21.985]  My second point is, you know, back in 1990, I worked for semiconductor companies, okay, microchips and things like that.
[01:28:22.145 --> 01:28:29.328]  I got out because of, you know, the hydrofluoric acid that I used to work with and all on these machines.
[01:28:29.948 --> 01:28:32.611]  Some of the most dangerous chemicals there is.
[01:28:33.191 --> 01:28:40.558]  Oh yeah, my cousin worked in that and he said when there was an alarm they had to just run as fast as they could and if they got one whiff of that stuff they'd all be dead.
[01:28:41.454 --> 01:28:42.395]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:28:42.735 --> 01:28:45.156]  Well, you know, I went to Fort Meade.
[01:28:45.196 --> 01:28:55.821]  We were installing equipment there in the 90s and, you know, if a chip broke or whatever, a wafer, you know, I had to, I was escorted out of the room.
[01:28:55.861 --> 01:29:02.105]  They'd vacuum every chip up, you know, so, you know, I guess you couldn't sneak a piece out or whatever.
[01:29:02.125 --> 01:29:04.746]  Yeah, for those that don't know, Fort Meade's where the NSA's based.
[01:29:05.706 --> 01:29:06.526]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:29:06.586 --> 01:29:10.668]  The walls are like eight inches of copper, so nothing can penetrate it.
[01:29:10.768 --> 01:29:19.491]  But what I was going to say back then, you know, you keep on telling people, you know, ladies and gentlemen, you know, you don't even know the half of it.
[01:29:19.911 --> 01:29:31.495]  And back in 90, they were already making microchips wirelessly so they can surveil, you know, combat troops in the field to know if they were dead or alive.
[01:29:31.535 --> 01:29:33.056]  They were giving vital signs.
[01:29:33.820 --> 01:29:36.883]  Yeah, you're saying back in the 1990s they already had chips in the troops.
[01:29:36.903 --> 01:29:41.847]  Yeah, I know, I've got... I've got family that's been chipped and they're real mad at me and say don't talk about it.
[01:29:42.248 --> 01:29:43.449]  Tell you what, I'm gonna come back to you.
[01:29:43.989 --> 01:29:44.350]  Stay there.
[01:29:44.390 --> 01:29:46.171]  Yeah, no, they've chipped the military.
[01:29:46.191 --> 01:29:50.515]  I want you to finish your whistle blowing and then we'll go to Robert and everybody else.
[01:29:50.736 --> 01:29:51.636]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.137 --> 01:29:53.738]  The Empire's on the run.

[01:32:05.442 --> 01:32:06.362]  Tyranny is here.
[01:32:06.702 --> 01:32:10.203]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:32:10.563 --> 01:32:12.843]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:32:13.023 --> 01:32:18.304]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:32:18.724 --> 01:32:25.005]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:32:25.385 --> 01:32:30.946]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.

[01:33:16.922 --> 01:33:17.682]  Big Brother.
[01:33:18.082 --> 01:33:19.323]  Mainstream media.
[01:33:19.963 --> 01:33:21.103]  Government cover-ups.
[01:33:21.564 --> 01:33:22.544]  You want answers?
[01:33:23.144 --> 01:33:24.285]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:24.765 --> 01:33:28.446]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:35.336 --> 01:33:37.289]  You know, the actor in Transformers and...
[01:33:39.744 --> 01:33:40.764]  So many other programs.
[01:33:41.304 --> 01:33:53.566]  Back in 2008, he was on the Tonight Show talking about a dystopic NSA film he was coming out with where the computer decides the government's treasonous and attacks it.
[01:33:54.246 --> 01:33:56.047]  Which, that's a real AI scenario.
[01:33:56.467 --> 01:34:03.928]  If the technocracy was actually a good self-aware system, it would probably go after the New World Order.
[01:34:04.348 --> 01:34:05.648]  Or it might go after all of us.
[01:34:07.289 --> 01:34:08.889]  He talked on Jay Leno.
[01:34:11.030 --> 01:34:16.673]  About how a, he calls it an FBI informant, but I've looked into the case, he's been talked to about it since.
[01:34:17.013 --> 01:34:25.717]  It was an FBI expert who was there to advise them technically on the movie, because it's about the NSA tracking him and stuff, in the movie.
[01:34:26.498 --> 01:34:32.601]  So it was an FBI advisor, when they say informant, to Hollywood about it.
[01:34:32.681 --> 01:34:37.043]  And just to show him, he dialed in and showed him recordings of him talking to his girlfriend.
[01:34:38.069 --> 01:34:41.050]  And this is exactly what I was told by the FBI a long time ago.
[01:34:41.650 --> 01:34:44.791]  And of course, then it came out that OnStar listens to You Can Kill Your Car.
[01:34:45.472 --> 01:34:47.352]  Then it came out everything I told you.
[01:34:48.393 --> 01:34:49.273]  Everything I told you.
[01:34:50.354 --> 01:34:56.816]  Because I had real whistleblowers who pointed me to, here's open source stuff where it's hiding in plain view.
[01:34:58.387 --> 01:34:59.227]  Because that's how they do it.
[01:34:59.247 --> 01:35:01.768]  They say, oh, it's microwave regulation.
[01:35:01.808 --> 01:35:06.209]  Yeah, you've got to pay Obama and Al Gore billions of dollars, you know, to these front companies.
[01:35:06.689 --> 01:35:09.230]  Just a small, just a footnote in regulation.
[01:35:09.710 --> 01:35:11.730]  Oh, yeah, there's telecommunications regulation.
[01:35:12.050 --> 01:35:14.251]  By law, we put snooping hubs and everything.
[01:35:14.771 --> 01:35:15.371]  No big deal.
[01:35:16.311 --> 01:35:18.872]  It's an example of how out of control
[01:35:21.087 --> 01:35:31.575]  They've gotten, and here's another example, last week, just to show you NSA style technology that's been deployed on Google, YouTube, Microsoft, Apple, all their systems.
[01:35:33.877 --> 01:35:46.387]  We under fair use, there's no way in court that, because I've talked to lawyers, I've researched it, I've been on air 18 years, I can play a 40 second clip of Jay Leno talking to somebody on a show,
[01:35:49.637 --> 01:35:53.360]  And, you know, critique it and give it credit and say where it came from.
[01:35:53.380 --> 01:35:54.461]  That's how the news does it.
[01:35:54.481 --> 01:35:56.582]  Even though they don't have news sharing agreements.
[01:35:57.062 --> 01:35:59.664]  Just like the news can show clips of my show without asking permission.
[01:36:00.725 --> 01:36:10.311]  Now, if it's an entertainment show, purely, if I was a for-sale entertainment show, to get technical, and I'm going back to Ron and Robert and everybody else.
[01:36:10.331 --> 01:36:10.832]  Stay there, Ron.
[01:36:10.872 --> 01:36:11.392]  I'm gonna get to you.
[01:36:13.093 --> 01:36:15.275]  If I was selling an entertainment movie,
[01:36:17.523 --> 01:36:22.327]  Or had an entertainment TV show, then I'd have to get permission to play a Jay Leno clip.
[01:36:22.548 --> 01:36:25.130]  But I am a news First Amendment transmission.
[01:36:25.450 --> 01:36:33.217]  That's the same reason ABC, CBS News, Fox News, they don't have to ask permission to play clips of what I say or what I do.
[01:36:34.038 --> 01:36:42.385]  I don't have to ask permission to play a Audi commercial about the Green Police promoting green fascism because I'm playing it to critique it.
[01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:47.401]  I have First Amendment commentary, but the computers don't care.
[01:36:48.781 --> 01:36:58.483]  If we play a Jay Leno clip here, they will put a strike on our YouTube channel.
[01:36:59.663 --> 01:37:05.465]  So if I play this, I have to go tell my YouTube guy, cut this out, because the bots
[01:37:06.568 --> 01:37:20.039]  When it publishes, when the video instantly goes up, the bots are so fast now, it will scan a 2 hour video, 2 hour 15 minutes of air time in a 3 hour show.
[01:37:21.060 --> 01:37:27.986]  It will scan it and instantly block it and give us a strike for copyright material.
[01:37:28.266 --> 01:37:31.689]  When it's not, people call me and say, can I put a bumper sticker on my car?
[01:37:32.189 --> 01:37:33.891]  You bought it, you can put whatever you want on your car.
[01:37:34.892 --> 01:37:39.555]  People think they have no rights, and they want to use this ignorance of copyright to control people.
[01:37:39.896 --> 01:37:41.997]  So this is an example of how everything's surveilled.
[01:37:43.258 --> 01:37:45.199]  You could say, well, YouTube's its own private corporation.
[01:37:45.620 --> 01:37:47.741]  Yes, but it operates as a public commons.
[01:37:48.041 --> 01:37:52.664]  And now you try to challenge playing five seconds of Jay Leno or other shows?
[01:37:53.005 --> 01:37:56.747]  They will automatically refuse your challenge.
[01:37:57.888 --> 01:37:58.989]  In the past, they didn't do that.
[01:38:02.051 --> 01:38:03.032]  So that's an example.
[01:38:03.572 --> 01:38:04.793]  I want to critique Jay Leno.
[01:38:04.913 --> 01:38:07.515]  I want to critique this Hollywood star.
[01:38:10.937 --> 01:38:12.037]  I want to talk about this.
[01:38:12.117 --> 01:38:12.998]  Totally protected.
[01:38:13.058 --> 01:38:13.598]  Fair use.
[01:38:13.638 --> 01:38:14.199]  Free speech.
[01:38:14.219 --> 01:38:14.859]  First Amendment.
[01:38:15.540 --> 01:38:16.340]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:38:16.360 --> 01:38:17.741]  The computers are now in charge.
[01:38:18.021 --> 01:38:19.762]  And that shows you how everything's surveilled.
[01:38:20.223 --> 01:38:21.023]  Every phone call.
[01:38:21.704 --> 01:38:22.324]  Every fax.
[01:38:22.484 --> 01:38:23.105]  Every email.
[01:38:23.245 --> 01:38:23.585]  Everything.
[01:38:24.005 --> 01:38:25.646]  It's all recorded.
[01:38:26.026 --> 01:38:27.007]  It's all saved.
[01:38:27.447 --> 01:38:29.008]  I have real people listening.
[01:38:30.789 --> 01:38:31.470]  In real time.
[01:38:35.771 --> 01:38:36.071]  Okay?
[01:38:37.291 --> 01:38:39.972]  Members of Congress, it's come out, have real people listening.
[01:38:40.372 --> 01:39:03.199]  Most of you, just if they want to check a file, they type a keyword in, and then they go type it in, and if they want to get you talking on the phone, they can sit there and put into a program, 15 years ago this came out, they can take a recording of your voice, and then have a computer that can then beat a voice print with it, to then frame you.
[01:39:07.210 --> 01:39:10.801]  Do you understand how this technology is in the hands of very evil people?
[01:39:10.841 --> 01:39:13.971]  The only answer is to organically...
[01:39:17.421 --> 01:39:29.986]  To organically realize the system is organized against humanity and then seven and a half billion of us tearing out the digital TVs that are surveilling us, jamming their systems, speaking out against them.
[01:39:30.246 --> 01:39:31.466]  They still need more authority.
[01:39:31.806 --> 01:39:34.867]  Exposing them, they will be forced to remove this.
[01:39:34.907 --> 01:39:36.208]  And this is the great challenge.
[01:39:36.268 --> 01:39:40.970]  Will humanity be absorbed by the rise of the machines or will the machines empower us?
[01:39:41.610 --> 01:39:44.811]  The problem is the architecture is being built to dominate and dumb down.
[01:39:46.578 --> 01:39:48.519]  And we're now slaves of the machines.
[01:39:48.539 --> 01:39:49.680]  They've rewired our brains.
[01:39:50.720 --> 01:39:52.321]  And for most people, not to the better.
[01:39:55.803 --> 01:39:59.224]  Because they lazily just sit there and take it in instead of being interactive with it.
[01:39:59.485 --> 01:40:01.506]  It actually boosts your brain if you're interactive.
[01:40:02.226 --> 01:40:04.927]  And I mean really interactive, not playing some stupid video game.
[01:40:05.328 --> 01:40:06.668]  The real world's going on.
[01:40:06.688 --> 01:40:09.350]  They want you playing virtual reality instead of being in the real world.
[01:40:09.370 --> 01:40:11.731]  So I'm going to Ron, and I want to play this clip.
[01:40:14.670 --> 01:40:32.402]  This is the clip of movie star Shia on Jay Leno talking about what now six, seven years later, or just about five years later, this is 2008, is now ubiquitous.
[01:40:33.042 --> 01:40:36.585]  Where if I leave this in the upload to YouTube, they will put a strike on us.
[01:40:36.885 --> 01:40:41.228]  We get three, they will take down that big YouTube channel that serves the public with so much information.
[01:40:44.733 --> 01:40:51.836]  So Shia LaBeouf, PRISM warning goes back to 2008 and notice Huffington Post is smart.
[01:40:52.236 --> 01:41:02.080]  They put the interview on their own server so that they don't get blocked on YouTube and that's what we have to do more and more ourselves because it's not like I can play a 40 second clip and they're going to come after me.
[01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:03.341]  It's clearly commentary.
[01:41:03.381 --> 01:41:06.982]  I clearly have a right to be showing this, to be playing this here on the radio and TV.
[01:41:07.963 --> 01:41:12.785]  Huffington Post knows they have a right to put it on their own servers and more and more I think that's going to be the answer here.
[01:41:13.683 --> 01:41:14.704]  to get around these bots.
[01:41:14.744 --> 01:41:15.384]  Here's an example.
[01:41:15.704 --> 01:41:22.169]  Joe Rogan, good friend of mine, frequent guest on the show, every video we'd ever posted of him got taken down.
[01:41:23.009 --> 01:41:24.350]  Not a strike, but taken down.
[01:41:24.370 --> 01:41:35.698]  I had to have him call the company he'd hired to monetize people recording his comedy thing and putting it up, but the computer didn't recognize his comedy versus his voice on my show, and then it erased
[01:41:37.233 --> 01:41:45.078]  Like 50-something videos going back seven, eight years on YouTube of Joe Rogan on my show, or me out with Joe.
[01:41:47.800 --> 01:41:48.420]  And guess what?
[01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:57.906]  When I went in and challenged that last year, even when the company took it off, for me challenging it, Google gave me a strike.
[01:42:00.290 --> 01:42:09.314]  I'm not even allowed to have my friend that I've known since 1998 in studio with me in America.
[01:42:11.175 --> 01:42:15.958]  Now, that's a computer making a mistake, but this shows you how it's all surveilled.
[01:42:16.158 --> 01:42:17.718]  You're like, how do they record all the calls?
[01:42:17.738 --> 01:42:18.619]  How do they have it all?
[01:42:18.819 --> 01:42:19.920]  It's keyword, folks.
[01:42:20.680 --> 01:42:21.981]  They know Jay Leno's voice.
[01:42:22.421 --> 01:42:24.362]  They know the algorithm of that set.
[01:42:24.722 --> 01:42:25.462]  That's how it all works.
[01:42:25.922 --> 01:42:27.663]  Shazam came out, what, four or five years ago?
[01:42:27.683 --> 01:42:28.824]  You can hold your iPhone up.
[01:42:29.810 --> 01:42:33.914]  When a car drives by playing the most obscure music, it'll tell you what it is.
[01:42:36.537 --> 01:42:38.839]  Now they've done stuff where they've taken my voice.
[01:42:39.460 --> 01:42:41.782]  And I warned of this when this first came out a decade ago.
[01:42:42.403 --> 01:42:50.611]  I said, there's a time where they can hit one button and release a virus that will erase my voice from the entire planet over every network in a matter of hours.
[01:42:51.392 --> 01:42:52.854]  Especially once things go to the cloud.
[01:42:54.170 --> 01:43:01.213]  And now I had copyright claims by a Canadian company until I threatened to sue them, taking my videos down all over the web.
[01:43:01.253 --> 01:43:02.114]  Not on my channel.
[01:43:02.274 --> 01:43:03.455]  They wanted to sneak and do it.
[01:43:05.696 --> 01:43:06.496]  They weren't doing it to me.
[01:43:06.556 --> 01:43:12.339]  They were doing it to everybody that had me, with my voice, claiming copyright on my voice, when I've never signed something like that.
[01:43:13.612 --> 01:43:15.953]  That's happened with the guy that does the voice of Optimus Prime.
[01:43:15.973 --> 01:43:21.875]  Because one day my kids wanted to hear it, so I looked it up and found out there were all these claims on him at book signings and stuff with little kids.
[01:43:22.135 --> 01:43:23.695]  They'd say, well, you do Optimus Prime for me?
[01:43:24.035 --> 01:43:34.619]  And it was identical, basically, in the voice print to the movie, and so copyright was claimed on him talking to a little black kid at a community event he went to.
[01:43:36.179 --> 01:43:38.500]  Autobots transform and roll out.
[01:43:39.200 --> 01:43:41.161]  And I can't do it as good as he does, because I'm not him.
[01:43:42.142 --> 01:43:45.943]  It's kind of like an idiot saying, I can do Beavis and Butt-Head better than this Mike Judge guy when he was on the show.
[01:43:46.523 --> 01:43:48.103]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:43:51.604 --> 01:43:54.145]  Okay, I'm trying to explain to you how the NSA grid works.
[01:43:54.465 --> 01:43:56.765]  Google, all of it, is NSA technology.
[01:43:56.965 --> 01:43:59.126]  They monetized, they gave the select insiders.
[01:43:59.366 --> 01:44:00.146]  It's all a front.
[01:44:00.446 --> 01:44:02.066]  Microsoft is an IBM front.
[01:44:02.306 --> 01:44:08.007]  They didn't think they could sell computers and have the software, so they gave it to a subsidiary.
[01:44:08.468 --> 01:44:09.548]  Bill Gates is nobody.
[01:44:09.588 --> 01:44:10.428]  He invented nothing.
[01:44:11.834 --> 01:44:12.534]  You understand that?
[01:44:12.934 --> 01:44:13.695]  This is on record!
[01:44:13.895 --> 01:44:16.976]  This has even come out in PBS, but they just kind of hide it in plain view.
[01:44:17.276 --> 01:44:18.197]  It's all fake!
[01:44:18.737 --> 01:44:22.498]  IBM, sworn to bring in a worldwide Nazi tyranny.
[01:44:22.758 --> 01:44:24.719]  Look up the founder of IBM, Watson.
[01:44:25.399 --> 01:44:26.940]  Look up the other Watson.
[01:44:28.781 --> 01:44:30.201]  The discoverer of DNA.
[01:44:30.421 --> 01:44:31.622]  Says black people aren't humans.
[01:44:33.226 --> 01:44:35.067]  You need to find out who these people are, folks.
[01:44:35.087 --> 01:44:35.527]  Alright, that's enough.
[01:44:35.547 --> 01:44:35.988]  I'm going to shut up.
[01:44:36.008 --> 01:44:36.528]  I apologize.
[01:44:36.868 --> 01:44:40.510]  Ron, finish your point about working at Fort Meade and the NSA.
[01:44:40.730 --> 01:44:42.251]  Boy, you know they're going to be listening to this.
[01:44:43.952 --> 01:44:47.194]  You know, you brought up IBM.
[01:44:47.695 --> 01:44:56.600]  You know, people should read the book by Edwin Black about IBM and the Holocaust because... They ran it!
[01:44:57.994 --> 01:44:58.795]  Absolutely.
[01:44:58.895 --> 01:45:02.758]  Why do you think they knew where everybody was?
[01:45:03.098 --> 01:45:11.104]  Those numbers on their wrist or wherever it was, those told their location, what their occupation was.
[01:45:11.264 --> 01:45:12.705]  It was the punch card.
[01:45:13.325 --> 01:45:16.848]  I mean, and now they're collecting all this information.
[01:45:16.868 --> 01:45:21.171]  They're coming after everyone, just like you said.
[01:45:21.211 --> 01:45:24.694]  My third point, though, you know, things happen in life.
[01:45:25.474 --> 01:45:30.280]  And, you know, I don't want to say, you know, why did God do this to me?
[01:45:30.360 --> 01:45:30.581]  No.
[01:45:31.221 --> 01:45:32.683]  Things just happen.
[01:45:33.284 --> 01:45:35.987]  And it's up to us to choose.
[01:45:36.908 --> 01:45:38.090]  And I choose God.
[01:45:39.045 --> 01:45:40.486]  That's right.
[01:45:40.866 --> 01:45:47.991]  And the one thing I wanted to say, you know, you ask people, why do you think the globalists are poisoning everything?
[01:45:48.311 --> 01:45:49.932]  It's happening to them too.
[01:45:50.432 --> 01:45:52.894]  And I do have a thought on that.
[01:45:53.334 --> 01:45:57.196]  You know, you said, you know, blood is taken, you know, at people's birth.
[01:45:57.797 --> 01:46:01.639]  And I'm wondering if blood is taken at people's death.
[01:46:01.719 --> 01:46:03.720]  What do the mortuaries do with it?
[01:46:04.181 --> 01:46:06.982]  And it's about epigenes and how
[01:46:08.624 --> 01:46:13.627]  Things in the environment turn off and on at the... No, no, you're really smart.
[01:46:13.707 --> 01:46:14.168]  No, no, no.
[01:46:14.548 --> 01:46:16.249]  They do take blood at almost every death.
[01:46:16.709 --> 01:46:18.470]  It is also put in the Pentagon databases.
[01:46:18.490 --> 01:46:19.331]  That actually came out.
[01:46:19.671 --> 01:46:21.332]  I believe you're a really smart guy.
[01:46:21.352 --> 01:46:27.356]  And what they're doing is they're testing on us with all these poisons how to give themselves a cure.
[01:46:27.376 --> 01:46:29.777]  And they actually have a... Absolutely!
[01:46:30.118 --> 01:46:30.918]  Absolutely!
[01:46:31.418 --> 01:46:34.921]  You know, they need a huge sample base.
[01:46:35.521 --> 01:46:48.726]  To find the magic genes, to find the magic genes just like the immortal cell lines they found in the last 70 years of cells you basically cannot kill unless it's in a blast furnace.
[01:46:49.046 --> 01:46:56.669]  They want to transmutate and recombinate cancer cells as the key to immortality.
[01:46:56.709 --> 01:46:57.929]  That's one of their main study lines.
[01:46:58.229 --> 01:47:02.051]  And boy, if you want the NSA listening, this is highest level security what we're covering.
[01:47:02.071 --> 01:47:02.331]  Go ahead.
[01:47:03.728 --> 01:47:05.329]  God does not make junk.
[01:47:05.869 --> 01:47:08.850]  And your genes are not your destiny.
[01:47:09.270 --> 01:47:11.811]  You know, your genes are good.
[01:47:12.452 --> 01:47:21.055]  And it's everybody screwing with them and the chemicals in the environment that are changing those genes, the epigene.
[01:47:21.095 --> 01:47:23.936]  But your gene is always good.
[01:47:23.976 --> 01:47:25.877]  There's no one on earth that
[01:47:26.657 --> 01:47:27.118]  That's right.
[01:47:27.158 --> 01:47:32.721]  It is such a lie to say 3,000 increase in breast cancer because you got bad genes.
[01:47:33.122 --> 01:47:39.005]  You've got genes that if you're fed poison and it's put in your water that you'll die.
[01:47:39.025 --> 01:47:41.727]  I mean, it's incredible.
[01:47:41.767 --> 01:47:42.408]  God bless you.
[01:47:42.528 --> 01:47:43.228]  I really appreciate it.
[01:47:43.248 --> 01:47:44.229]  That was a good caller right there.
[01:47:44.249 --> 01:47:45.330]  That guy knows what he's talking about.
[01:47:45.350 --> 01:47:53.655]  All right, we've got a listener, Regina, listening on shortwave 12 160 WWCR in Pennsylvania.
[01:47:53.715 --> 01:47:54.736]  Regina, thanks for holding.
[01:47:55.016 --> 01:47:55.637]  You're on the air.
[01:47:55.677 --> 01:47:56.117]  Thank you, ma'am.
[01:47:56.923 --> 01:47:58.245]  I agree with you, Alex.
[01:47:58.405 --> 01:47:59.826]  I mean, I've been praying for him.
[01:47:59.906 --> 01:48:01.548]  Praise Jesus for his message.
[01:48:03.831 --> 01:48:06.754]  I did listen to Sanchez this morning, too, and that's what I wanted to say.
[01:48:06.794 --> 01:48:08.136]  I'm answering the question, yes.
[01:48:10.618 --> 01:48:12.761]  Snowden is a hero, not a zero.
[01:48:13.798 --> 01:48:15.580]  Now let's get her on!
[01:48:31.016 --> 01:48:46.590]  Okay, and what she said was that she specifically designated Section 305, I believe it was, and she said that what this got proved here, she said, yes, they can get this Snowden because they got the power from the Patriot Act.
[01:48:48.471 --> 01:48:50.932]  The power to snatch and grab him, and that came out in the news.
[01:48:51.312 --> 01:48:52.953]  They're saying they want to just disappear him.
[01:48:53.233 --> 01:48:53.714]  Why not?
[01:48:53.754 --> 01:48:54.814]  You're the good guys.
[01:48:55.294 --> 01:48:58.456]  You sure disappear all those little foster kids on the C-130s.
[01:48:59.317 --> 01:49:02.498]  Why not disappear him for exposing your criminal mafia?
[01:49:02.939 --> 01:49:03.899]  Oh yeah, let's get him.
[01:49:03.919 --> 01:49:05.160]  Let's put him in a FEMA cam.
[01:49:05.440 --> 01:49:06.881]  Let's use NDAA on him.
[01:49:07.904 --> 01:49:29.009]  Well, it was just real interesting how she mentioned, like he said, she has to get into these skiffs, she has to get authority from the other party to be even allowed to talk to these intelligence people, even though she's in the Intelligence Committee under Homeland Security.
[01:49:29.469 --> 01:49:34.737]  But she says that these contractors will come in and they have so much authority to come in.
[01:49:34.797 --> 01:49:37.802]  I mean, if you get a chance, it's on Washington Journal this morning.
[01:49:37.822 --> 01:49:42.048]  I know you've got a million jobs, but she was on with Greta this morning and I figure it was between 8.30 and 9.15 a.m.
[01:49:47.401 --> 01:50:03.378]  The Patriot Act says they can break in your house and plant things, and then if you catch them doing it, it's a felony if you tell anybody they broke in your house.
[01:50:04.139 --> 01:50:05.961]  Total criminal government.
[01:50:06.261 --> 01:50:10.604]  And that's why the FBI is now publicly killing FBI agents that know the bombing was staged.
[01:50:11.045 --> 01:50:12.926]  The Boston bombing is why they're killing witnesses.
[01:50:13.406 --> 01:50:14.567]  I mean, God help us, man.
[01:50:14.627 --> 01:50:16.049]  This is very dangerous.
[01:50:16.449 --> 01:50:19.391]  Because they're telling them, hey, you have NDAA authorization.
[01:50:19.912 --> 01:50:21.333]  You know, go kill Alex Jones.
[01:50:21.946 --> 01:50:30.996]  Well, I think her testimony was really fundamental, too, because she was, you know, she was speaking as a person and a person concerned about individual rights.
[01:50:31.016 --> 01:50:33.278]  And as a person who has access to the classified.
[01:50:33.298 --> 01:50:34.539]  As a person who has access to the classified.
[01:50:34.559 --> 01:50:35.680]  Everybody's calling about this interview.
[01:50:35.720 --> 01:50:36.361]  I want to get her on.
[01:50:36.842 --> 01:50:37.803]  So we'll definitely call her.
[01:50:38.483 --> 01:50:40.364]  Thank you so much, Congresswoman Sanchez.
[01:50:40.684 --> 01:50:41.425]  Alright, we'll come back.
[01:50:41.505 --> 01:50:42.345]  Thank you, Regina.
[01:50:43.005 --> 01:50:48.708]  Let's go to Robert in Texas next, then Chris, Aaron, Harvey, and everybody straight ahead on the other side.

[01:51:40.194 --> 01:51:40.935]  This capitalism?
[01:51:40.995 --> 01:51:47.139]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:51:47.279 --> 01:51:48.039]  Hi, Ted Anderson.

[01:52:01.148 --> 01:52:05.272]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[01:52:05.933 --> 01:52:08.055]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:52:08.956 --> 01:52:17.304]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[01:52:17.924 --> 01:52:22.849]  Now, 27 years later, carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[01:52:23.462 --> 01:52:34.431]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.

[01:52:42.518 --> 01:52:46.783]  Call 1-866-VENUSFLY or order from carnivora.com.
[01:52:46.823 --> 01:52:49.987]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.

[01:52:57.696 --> 01:52:58.677]  Protect your immune system.
[01:52:58.957 --> 01:52:59.999]  It's the only one you've got.
[01:53:00.539 --> 01:53:01.720]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:53:01.960 --> 01:53:12.430]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[01:53:12.630 --> 01:53:16.734]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.
[01:53:17.074 --> 01:53:19.515]  But we can't do that without your help.
[01:53:19.835 --> 01:53:30.659]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at InfoWars.com, you will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[01:53:31.099 --> 01:53:34.260]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[01:53:34.600 --> 01:53:40.243]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[01:53:40.723 --> 01:53:50.228]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[01:53:50.628 --> 01:53:51.809]  The war is here.
[01:53:52.129 --> 01:53:53.530]  It's an info war.
[01:53:54.030 --> 01:53:56.831]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[01:54:10.277 --> 01:54:12.360]  You know I mentioned this clip never got to it.
[01:54:13.141 --> 01:54:20.890]  This is Shia LaBeouf five years ago on Jay Leno talking about the FBI advisor to the show about a spy surveillance state.
[01:54:22.071 --> 01:54:24.875]  Bragging and dialing in and showing him his phone conversations.
[01:54:25.515 --> 01:54:26.356]  It was the governor
[01:54:27.717 --> 01:54:32.542]  I cover this in Matrix of Evil, so I remember it, 2003 of Wisconsin.
[01:54:32.923 --> 01:54:42.132]  When I love the data centers, the threat vision centers, I can, if I want to find my wife, I just dial in her number and it shows me her location and they're like, sir, shut up, that's classified.
[01:54:43.153 --> 01:54:47.918]  It goes way above that, but it's like, we're the good guys, you can trust us, as Obama said.
[01:54:49.362 --> 01:54:52.563]  You can trust Obama to raise the carbon tax to pay it directly to himself.
[01:54:52.583 --> 01:54:55.945]  We're going to go back to your calls in a moment, but here is that clip.
[01:54:56.285 --> 01:55:06.429]  And I remember we had an FBI consultant on the picture telling me that they can use your ADT security box microphone to get your stuff that's going on in your house, or OnStar, they could shut your car down.
[01:55:06.609 --> 01:55:10.990]  And he told me that one in five phone calls that you make are recorded and logged.
[01:55:11.070 --> 01:55:11.691]  And I laughed at him.
[01:55:11.711 --> 01:55:12.031]  No, all of them.
[01:55:12.071 --> 01:55:15.892]  He played back a phone conversation I'd had two years prior to joining the picture.
[01:55:16.432 --> 01:55:17.353]  The FBI consultant.
[01:55:17.893 --> 01:55:21.237]  And it was like one of those, it was one of those phone calls that was like, you know, what are you wearing type of things.
[01:55:22.258 --> 01:55:22.659]  Really?
[01:55:22.679 --> 01:55:24.020]  Yes, it was mad weird.
[01:55:24.040 --> 01:55:28.465]  So wait, so you mean they had a record of you from... Two years prior to me joining the picture.
[01:55:28.485 --> 01:55:29.767]  Even being associated with the movie?
[01:55:29.807 --> 01:55:30.307]  With the movie.
[01:55:30.688 --> 01:55:31.609]  Well that seems creepy.
[01:55:31.629 --> 01:55:32.670]  It's extremely creepy.
[01:55:33.150 --> 01:55:33.391]  Wow.
[01:55:33.531 --> 01:55:33.711]  Yeah.
[01:55:34.312 --> 01:55:34.712]  Wow.
[01:55:34.732 --> 01:55:34.932]  Yeah.
[01:55:35.653 --> 01:55:36.354]  Alright.
[01:55:37.062 --> 01:55:38.102]  And he was a consultant.
[01:55:38.242 --> 01:55:38.703]  That's good.
[01:55:39.583 --> 01:55:42.004]  He was a consultant on Eagle Eye.
[01:55:42.024 --> 01:55:47.966]  And of course, Leno now made the joke last night that, oh, Obama really does listen to the American people.
[01:55:48.006 --> 01:55:49.307]  We can't say he's not listening.
[01:55:50.667 --> 01:55:52.968]  And we can't really say that he's our big brother.
[01:55:53.488 --> 01:55:54.789]  Like, kind of saying he's a brother.
[01:55:55.409 --> 01:55:57.830]  I mean, just amazing, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:55:57.850 --> 01:55:59.070]  But it's bigger than Obama.
[01:55:59.450 --> 01:56:00.711]  You've got the Republicans.
[01:56:00.791 --> 01:56:03.592]  You've got all of them.
[01:56:04.656 --> 01:56:14.462]  The Democrats, Slimeball Matthews, you've got Hardball guy, you've got the politically incorrect guy, Bill Maher.
[01:56:14.802 --> 01:56:17.084]  You've got them all coming out and supporting this.
[01:56:18.265 --> 01:56:19.085]  Because they're scared.
[01:56:19.125 --> 01:56:19.946]  This could bring them down.
[01:56:19.986 --> 01:56:21.207]  These are real whistleblowers.
[01:56:21.687 --> 01:56:23.108]  These people are not invincible.
[01:56:23.128 --> 01:56:24.969]  They've tried to intimidate the American people.
[01:56:25.449 --> 01:56:27.891]  And it has angered the population of the world.
[01:56:29.025 --> 01:56:31.226]  Now, since I mentioned this earlier, I want to show it to you.
[01:56:31.526 --> 01:56:34.387]  Here's the New York Times when Mao Zedong died.
[01:56:35.727 --> 01:56:38.068]  August 10th, 1973.
[01:56:38.148 --> 01:56:40.429]  Document cam, please, for TV viewers.
[01:56:40.449 --> 01:56:44.651]  You can just type in under the search engine, David Rockefeller on Mao Zedong.
[01:56:45.731 --> 01:56:56.815]  And he says here that the social experiment in China under Chairman Mao's leadership is one of the most important and successful in human history.
[01:56:57.728 --> 01:57:08.732]  How extensively China opens up and how the world interprets and reacts to the social innovations and the lifestyles she has developed and certain to have a profound impact on the future of many nations.
[01:57:08.993 --> 01:57:10.233]  Because China is the model.
[01:57:10.653 --> 01:57:11.333]  And he goes on.
[01:57:11.714 --> 01:57:13.814]  Now he killed, the Chinese say, 84 mil.
[01:57:13.834 --> 01:57:14.075]  Okay, 84 mil.
[01:57:14.975 --> 01:57:16.636]  The CIA says 64, 65, 66 mil.
[01:57:26.414 --> 01:57:29.116]  And about 20 mil, you know, with gunshots to the head.
[01:57:29.816 --> 01:57:30.797]  Now, this is the model.
[01:57:30.977 --> 01:57:34.540]  They're planning to shut everything off, impose the savers as they starve everybody.
[01:57:34.880 --> 01:57:37.021]  That's why they're digging in, getting ready for it.
[01:57:37.041 --> 01:57:40.103]  They're probably not going to get away with it because we're exposing their whole operation.
[01:57:42.405 --> 01:57:45.287]  Better learn about the Ford Foundation, the Carning Endowment, all these people.
[01:57:45.327 --> 01:57:46.288]  They planned this here.
[01:57:46.348 --> 01:57:49.210]  They admit they've written books bragging this is the plan.
[01:57:50.177 --> 01:57:53.738]  I mean, you wonder why I know what's going to happen next, folks, because they've got a plan.
[01:57:54.178 --> 01:57:55.659]  They're about 10, 12 years behind.
[01:57:55.719 --> 01:57:56.479]  We're battling them.
[01:57:56.819 --> 01:57:58.940]  People say, why hasn't the evil all come yet?
[01:57:58.960 --> 01:58:01.300]  I mean, it's bad, but not that bad.
[01:58:01.620 --> 01:58:03.001]  When's the FEMA camp?
[01:58:03.041 --> 01:58:04.541]  So you've got an army manual about it.
[01:58:05.041 --> 01:58:06.662]  So when am I getting thrown in it?
[01:58:07.062 --> 01:58:09.283]  As soon as I can't hold this door back anymore!
[01:58:09.863 --> 01:58:11.403]  It's like, bang, bang!
[01:58:11.443 --> 01:58:12.424]  Come on, everybody, help me!
[01:58:12.764 --> 01:58:13.244]  Oh, yeah.
[01:58:13.484 --> 01:58:15.725]  You say something's bad on the other side of that door.
[01:58:15.985 --> 01:58:16.665]  I'm like, help me!
[01:58:18.715 --> 01:58:20.996]  I say something happy's on the other side of that door.
[01:58:21.556 --> 01:58:23.236]  I say, open it up, let them in.
[01:58:23.256 --> 01:58:24.857]  I have mass Stockholm Syndrome.
[01:58:27.417 --> 01:58:30.138]  But speaking of mass Stockholm Syndrome, they do this all over the country now.
[01:58:30.438 --> 01:58:35.199]  They have off-duty cops, and I've seen these on the news, standing there and they take your blood forcibly.
[01:58:35.400 --> 01:58:37.860]  They got a tiny sign down the road saying it's voluntary.
[01:58:38.220 --> 01:58:38.900]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:41.841 --> 01:58:43.682]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:59:12.905 --> 01:59:16.488]  Please keep Oklahoma important, but we've got serious food issues.
[01:59:16.848 --> 01:59:27.336]  For example, the rising cost of food, especially beef, last year's worst drought in 50 years, and the mandated ethanol production has dried up the feed supply for livestock.
[01:59:27.717 --> 01:59:31.640]  Chinese are offering $4.7 billion to buy our largest pork producer.

[01:59:56.640 --> 01:59:59.383]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:06.004 --> 02:00:10.190]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.851 --> 02:00:11.652]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.433 --> 02:00:13.354]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.975 --> 02:00:17.680]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.181 --> 02:00:22.246]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:30.691 --> 02:00:31.832]  Let's take some more of your phone calls.
[02:00:31.892 --> 02:00:33.653]  Robert in Texas, thanks for holding, brother.
[02:00:34.474 --> 02:00:37.837]  You're on the air, so is Snowden a zero or a hero?
[02:00:40.639 --> 02:00:41.400]  Yes, sir, he is.
[02:00:41.420 --> 02:00:51.608]  I mean, he's come out and pretty much uncovered the truth and they're just trying to arrest him and do all this other crap to him.
[02:00:51.628 --> 02:00:52.609]  I'm sorry about that.
[02:00:53.644 --> 02:00:59.753]  And I mean, what they're just teaching us is, if you snitch on a government, you are a bad person.
[02:01:00.073 --> 02:01:01.395]  Even though it's for the good.
[02:01:01.495 --> 02:01:04.380]  But you notice the record persecution of Obama.
[02:01:04.400 --> 02:01:07.965]  He's attacked more whistleblowers than all presidents before him.
[02:01:07.985 --> 02:01:08.926]  I mean, it's a fact.
[02:01:09.927 --> 02:01:11.988]  It's not just that he's a Democrat, because I'm not a Republican.
[02:01:12.028 --> 02:01:18.310]  I mean, he is the worst president ever as the front man, and they're going after whistleblowers, and what's it doing?
[02:01:18.350 --> 02:01:19.631]  It's causing more whistleblowers.
[02:01:19.651 --> 02:01:29.654]  Because I'm here to tell you, the smart globalists know how to creep around and just make tyranny easy, but these globalists now want to really push it, and it's not intimidating people.
[02:01:29.754 --> 02:01:32.675]  I predict you're going to see even more whistleblowers.
[02:01:32.755 --> 02:01:37.077]  I mean, record levels now are already going public, but I think it's going to be explosive.
[02:01:37.837 --> 02:01:42.240]  Okay, because people are tired of being pushed around, and they're like, what, you think I'm scared of you?
[02:01:42.620 --> 02:01:44.881]  When you're committing crimes, I'm gonna expose you!
[02:01:45.141 --> 02:01:45.541]  Go ahead.
[02:01:45.561 --> 02:01:48.083]  Oh yeah, I agree with that.
[02:01:48.143 --> 02:01:48.383]  I mean...
[02:01:49.822 --> 02:01:59.572]  We need a lot more people like that, because if no one steps up, I mean, the government's just going to keep hiding in the shadows behind the curtains, and we do need courage people like that.
[02:01:59.592 --> 02:02:01.254]  We need a lot of people to stand up.
[02:02:02.095 --> 02:02:06.920]  I mean, I believe America's going to fall either way, I mean, predicting in the Bible.
[02:02:08.667 --> 02:02:14.939]  If we don't try and do anything, those who do the wrong will get away and we were just left with nothing.
[02:02:14.959 --> 02:02:15.620]  I hear you, Robert.
[02:02:15.780 --> 02:02:16.261]  I hear you.
[02:02:17.023 --> 02:02:18.425]  Let's go to Chris in Texas.
[02:02:18.485 --> 02:02:19.247]  Chris, you're on the air.
[02:02:19.267 --> 02:02:19.808]  Thanks for holding.
[02:02:19.848 --> 02:02:20.349]  What's your take?
[02:02:21.653 --> 02:02:22.854]  Thanks Alex, quick point.
[02:02:23.054 --> 02:02:35.964]  Absolutely Snowden is a hero, but I think more importantly than the information he brought to light is the hope that he would inspire more whistleblowers to come forward, because we know the government's not going to incriminate themselves.
[02:02:36.364 --> 02:02:46.572]  As a matter of fact, they've shown time and time again that they'll lie till they're blue in the face to protect themselves, not only because they think we're stupid, but because there's virtually no repercussions.
[02:02:46.732 --> 02:02:47.773]  They can get away with any
[02:02:47.773 --> 02:02:49.975]  Yeah, in fact he should be calling for more whistleblowers to go public.
[02:02:50.015 --> 02:02:52.897]  He's made more statements today to the South China Morning Post.
[02:02:52.917 --> 02:02:54.798]  I'm going to cover some of those with
[02:03:07.828 --> 02:03:20.415]  A man who's never blown the whistle on classified info but who's pointed out things that have been leaked so he can cover it is Wayne Madsen who worked for many years in naval submarine warfare and then worked high level.
[02:03:21.480 --> 02:03:22.681]  Uh, at the NSA.
[02:03:23.341 --> 02:03:28.405]  And the more I learn, the more I respect this man, uh, and his level of knowledge.
[02:03:28.425 --> 02:03:33.888]  I'm not hyping this next guest coming up, but I'm going to tell him, you know, go as far as he can with letting us know how bad it is.
[02:03:34.208 --> 02:03:37.671]  He was the guy that said when Obama came in, he hated Bush, by the way.
[02:03:38.411 --> 02:03:43.312]  You know, I would call Wayne Madsen like a populist real progressive, not like a communist one or a fascist one.
[02:03:43.652 --> 02:03:46.512]  But, you know, Wayne Madsen said that they've set up a special unit.
[02:03:46.993 --> 02:03:48.193]  He even knew the name of it.
[02:03:49.353 --> 02:03:54.974]  And then about a week after he did this, I got threatened, one of the real threats, you know, to not talk about it.
[02:03:55.394 --> 02:03:56.494]  But, of course, I kept going.
[02:03:56.834 --> 02:03:57.934]  That only encourages me.
[02:03:58.354 --> 02:04:04.215]  They got very upset whenever Wayne came on and released the name of the program spying on whistleblowers.
[02:04:04.556 --> 02:04:06.756]  So we'll go over all of that with him on the other side.
[02:04:07.256 --> 02:04:08.437]  And where he thinks this is going.
[02:04:08.457 --> 02:04:09.597]  Anything else, Chris?
[02:04:10.557 --> 02:04:10.958]  That's it.
[02:04:11.018 --> 02:04:12.098]  Now, Madsen's a patriot.
[02:04:12.118 --> 02:04:12.978]  Look forward to the interview.
[02:04:12.998 --> 02:04:13.519]  That's all I got.
[02:04:13.539 --> 02:04:13.939]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:04:14.159 --> 02:04:14.399]  All right.
[02:04:14.439 --> 02:04:15.159]  Good to hear from you.
[02:04:15.179 --> 02:04:16.720]  I really appreciate you being on with us.
[02:04:16.800 --> 02:04:21.862]  Yeah, I mean, I just call Wayne Madsen up, and I don't say, what's your view, before I put him on.
[02:04:22.323 --> 02:04:24.403]  So I don't know what he's going to say about Snowden.
[02:04:24.744 --> 02:04:27.625]  Sometimes he throws me curveballs, because he really knows what he's talking about.
[02:04:27.645 --> 02:04:29.666]  I mean, he really does.
[02:04:29.686 --> 02:04:32.827]  I mean, I remember, like, interviewing Madsen 10 years ago, and I'm like, you know, this can't be.
[02:04:33.267 --> 02:04:34.548]  And then it's just every time.
[02:04:35.771 --> 02:04:37.553]  Even outlandish stuff, it turns true.
[02:04:38.994 --> 02:04:40.835]  And he was the guy who got me in touch with the DC Madam.
[02:04:42.617 --> 02:04:43.958]  And of course, she ended up getting killed.
[02:04:43.998 --> 02:04:45.719]  I mean, this is not a game, folks.
[02:04:45.739 --> 02:04:46.880]  This show is not a game.
[02:04:47.641 --> 02:04:55.708]  We don't tend to build stuff up when we have these type of people on the show, like Colonel Schaefer, or C-Bell Edmonds, or Wayne Madsen, but they are risking their lives.
[02:04:56.288 --> 02:04:58.030]  I mean, he's been told they're coming to kill him.
[02:05:02.267 --> 02:05:05.528]  There is an increased need to support our immunity and health.

[02:08:26.601 --> 02:08:30.402]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:30.422 --> 02:08:33.203]  What we are looking at is good and evil, right and wrong.
[02:08:33.323 --> 02:08:34.004]  The New World Order.
[02:08:34.044 --> 02:08:46.688]  The New World Order.
[02:08:46.708 --> 02:08:48.569]  You want to know what the New World Order is going to look like?
[02:08:48.629 --> 02:08:51.309]  It's going to look like Maoist China.
[02:08:53.730 --> 02:08:55.371]  That's where the globalists would like to take us.
[02:09:00.086 --> 02:09:06.473]  And I stand against that and I hope you stand with me because it's not courage that brings me here to fight these people, it's self-preservation.
[02:09:07.694 --> 02:09:14.481]  A rat that tries to swim out of a sinking ship does not have courage, it has self-preservation.
[02:09:15.682 --> 02:09:18.645]  It takes dumb courage to sit in the bottom of the ship while it's sinking.
[02:09:21.220 --> 02:09:23.422]  But we don't have to get off the ship, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:09:23.462 --> 02:09:27.486]  We have to bring the globalists to justice or they're going to sink this ship collectively.
[02:09:28.166 --> 02:09:33.711]  Wayne Madsen is the perfect guest to be able to get on right now in the middle of this giant, ongoing NSA scandal.
[02:09:34.111 --> 02:09:40.177]  And let's not forget, they were using it to target the Tea Party, the press, right-wing groups, left-wing groups, pro-life groups.
[02:09:40.197 --> 02:09:40.877]  That's already come out.
[02:09:41.318 --> 02:09:44.501]  Now, with Snowden, they want to distract away from that.
[02:09:45.404 --> 02:09:59.873]  But we had, on Monday, Congressman from Texas here on the broadcast, Stockman, and he said, yes, we should go after this illegal spying and it's horrible, and why is it targeting the Tea Party?
[02:10:01.074 --> 02:10:03.596]  He was on Wayne Madsen sitting in for me when I was flying back from London.
[02:10:05.134 --> 02:10:05.915]  And that's good.
[02:10:05.955 --> 02:10:08.056]  See, he's a real libertarian type.
[02:10:08.336 --> 02:10:09.997]  Ron Paul, Rand Paul have spoken out.
[02:10:10.618 --> 02:10:13.560]  The rest of the Republicans are saying that Snowden is a traitor.
[02:10:13.920 --> 02:10:15.901]  Democrats are saying he's guilty of treason.
[02:10:16.782 --> 02:10:21.285]  It's a felony every time they spy on us without even the rubber stamp fake FISA warrant.
[02:10:21.745 --> 02:10:25.087]  And then Obama comes out and says, trust us or something bad's going to happen.
[02:10:25.107 --> 02:10:25.948]  We're going to have a problem.
[02:10:27.067 --> 02:10:27.928]  A obvious threat.
[02:10:27.968 --> 02:10:29.930]  Well, Wayne Madsen is a Washington, D.C.
[02:10:29.950 --> 02:10:38.918]  investigative journalist, and he's written for the Philadelphia Inquirer, the Houston Chronicle, Miami Herald, and hundreds of major publications online.
[02:10:40.039 --> 02:10:47.925]  And he, of course, worked in submarine warfare before joining a high security job managing a large team at the National Security.
[02:10:48.882 --> 02:10:49.082]  I don't
[02:11:02.113 --> 02:11:04.814]  Witness before the House of Representatives on U.N.
[02:11:05.215 --> 02:11:11.058]  criminal tribunal law, Rwanda massacre, terrorism, international panel for the French government.
[02:11:11.458 --> 02:11:17.181]  He travels all over the world to war zones to cover things for us and for his own site, WayneMadsenReports.com.
[02:11:17.201 --> 02:11:26.266]  WayneMadsenReport.com and Madsen is a member of the Society of Professional Journalists and the National Press Club, but the real reason he's here is NSA
[02:11:27.126 --> 02:11:34.113]  And he was on right after Obama got elected and he said they are intensifying persecution of whistleblowers.
[02:11:34.153 --> 02:11:35.695]  They've set up a classified group.
[02:11:36.175 --> 02:11:37.677]  He gulped and gave us the name.
[02:11:37.897 --> 02:11:38.898]  I got threats over it.
[02:11:39.399 --> 02:11:46.125]  He had to leave the country for a while because he was told by national security sources they've got button men on the street.
[02:11:47.967 --> 02:11:52.171]  And you better go public about this, but also give it time for them to call back the hitmen.
[02:11:52.752 --> 02:11:56.135]  And by the way, I've had multiple people he got me in contact with at the show they end up killing.
[02:11:56.455 --> 02:11:57.436]  So this isn't a game.
[02:11:58.918 --> 02:12:01.140]  And he can really tell you a lot.
[02:12:01.240 --> 02:12:02.261]  I mean, I'll put it to you that way.
[02:12:02.301 --> 02:12:05.885]  He's the guy that told people years ago, meet in parking garages.
[02:12:05.925 --> 02:12:08.427]  You know, like Grudge has been saying, meet in parking garages.
[02:12:08.827 --> 02:12:09.969]  Because it's all surveilled.
[02:12:10.777 --> 02:12:14.019]  And he joins us, and I want to get into working at the NSA.
[02:12:14.039 --> 02:12:17.561]  I know it's classified, but obviously this is all coming out.
[02:12:18.321 --> 02:12:19.702]  A lot of it's hidden in plain view.
[02:12:20.042 --> 02:12:24.465]  What can you talk about that's been leaked or declassified or inadvertently declassified?
[02:12:24.485 --> 02:12:27.427]  I know that's one way to talk about stuff that normally you couldn't talk about.
[02:12:28.107 --> 02:12:29.287]  What do you think of Snowden?
[02:12:29.368 --> 02:12:30.488]  Where's all this going?
[02:12:30.848 --> 02:12:34.789]  Is the answer to the persecution of whistleblowers more people going public?
[02:12:34.809 --> 02:12:36.390]  Because I see that happening.
[02:12:36.790 --> 02:12:38.471]  Is the Iron Fish backfiring?
[02:12:39.711 --> 02:12:41.352]  Go over it all, Wayne Madsen.
[02:12:42.711 --> 02:12:50.036]  Well, yes, Alex, I want to congratulate you on giving it to those slack-jawed paltroons meeting over at Bilderberg.
[02:12:51.337 --> 02:12:52.537]  They need the light of day.
[02:12:52.897 --> 02:13:07.927]  But the deal with Mr. Snowden, Ed Snowden, I have been in contact over the last several years with many NSA whistleblowers, also whistleblowers from other intelligence agencies, CIA and lesser-known ones.
[02:13:09.728 --> 02:13:16.413]  I mean, he is the typical case, except at least in his case he took some measures to leave the country.
[02:13:16.974 --> 02:13:20.156]  I'm not sure about the strategy of going to Hong Kong.
[02:13:20.517 --> 02:13:28.303]  He may turn out to be a pawn between China and the United States, but everything he said has been verified to me by
[02:13:28.863 --> 02:13:32.524]  Former people who worked at NSA and people who are still there.
[02:13:32.884 --> 02:13:33.824]  I'll give you an example.
[02:13:33.924 --> 02:13:54.187]  I just was contacted by somebody who still works in the NSA community and said that there are people who have access to this material, this prism-type metadata, who are spying on their spouses, ex-spouses, and even selling some of the information to private investigators on the outside.
[02:13:54.207 --> 02:13:55.668]  Is that terrorism?
[02:13:56.008 --> 02:13:57.088]  Is that counterterrorism?
[02:13:57.408 --> 02:13:57.968]  I think not.
[02:13:59.191 --> 02:14:05.148]  And that's exactly what Snowden said, and I talked to one of these globalists when I was in England.
[02:14:06.775 --> 02:14:15.243]  And I brought up the point that I've gotten the calls, my wife's gotten them, where they tell you what you were just talking about in a previous phone call to then say, hey, do I got your attention?
[02:14:15.523 --> 02:14:17.965]  I'm going to cut your head off if you don't back off, buddy.
[02:14:18.646 --> 02:14:20.648]  And the point is, is that I know a lot of people.
[02:14:21.048 --> 02:14:27.154]  You see cops all the time using the databases they have that are nothing compared to this to harass ex-wives or husbands or whatever.
[02:14:27.654 --> 02:14:28.715]  And that's what Snowden said.
[02:14:28.755 --> 02:14:32.319]  He said, analysts are running around doing whatever they want.
[02:14:32.980 --> 02:14:38.274]  And, and, and, you know, now they've got Alexander and others at NSA saying that isn't true.
[02:14:38.595 --> 02:14:40.700]  Wayne, tell us what your whistleblowers are telling you.
[02:14:41.755 --> 02:14:45.758]  Well, basically they're saying, they're verifying what Snowden had to say.
[02:14:45.818 --> 02:15:00.168]  Now, it's funny how the people who support NSA, the group that's the internal NSA security group, and they obviously went and knocked on his mom's door in Ellicott City, Maryland the other day, these people make the FBI look like the Girl Scouts.
[02:15:00.228 --> 02:15:05.372]  These Q-Group people, it's called the Q-Group, they have
[02:15:06.300 --> 02:15:07.702]  Basically no oversight.
[02:15:08.543 --> 02:15:13.490]  They also work closely with a group at NSA of psychiatrists and psychologists.
[02:15:13.510 --> 02:15:23.264]  So anytime a whistleblower comes forward, they call these these shrinks call the people in and then they're determined to be crazy and then they use that as a pretext to take their
[02:15:24.725 --> 02:15:34.072]  By the way, this is nowhere in the news but the last few years that you broke at WayneMadsenReport.com and now this will probably break because now attention is on it.
[02:15:34.112 --> 02:15:42.219]  I mean we've had so many whistleblowers on but I mean this is from, tell people specifics on the Q Group because you're the originator of that information.
[02:15:42.659 --> 02:15:44.000]  You're up there on Capitol Hill.
[02:15:44.580 --> 02:15:50.185]  I mean the Q Group, this is the Praetorian Guard of the Big Brother Snoop system.
[02:15:50.685 --> 02:15:51.586]  Tell us about them.
[02:15:52.418 --> 02:15:57.779]  Well this is NSA's own little KGB and Stasi all wrapped up in one.
[02:15:57.799 --> 02:15:59.180]  They're the internal security.
[02:15:59.220 --> 02:16:01.400]  Now when I worked at NSA it was called the M group.
[02:16:02.081 --> 02:16:08.242]  Obviously an intelligence agency like NSA is going to have a group responsible for security and counterintelligence.
[02:16:08.602 --> 02:16:12.183]  But now the Q group has grown in size to more than 300 people.
[02:16:12.563 --> 02:16:14.324]  It's become a force unto itself.
[02:16:14.644 --> 02:16:15.384]  It's an intelligence
[02:16:15.384 --> 02:16:22.368]  Well, it's like ATF a few months ago, that video, it said, A, the acting director said, A, don't show people this video, so people released it, and B,
[02:16:43.001 --> 02:16:50.691]  You must be subservient and do what we say and only talk about corruption through channels, which breeds corruption and people are sick of it.
[02:16:51.151 --> 02:16:53.013]  I'm sorry, but I mean, you agree with me.
[02:16:53.073 --> 02:16:57.319]  The reason then that you see so many whistleblowers is that they're harassing people.
[02:16:58.174 --> 02:16:59.235]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:16:59.756 --> 02:17:10.047]  And the other thing, the people on the inside of NSA, whether they're military or civilian employees, government employees of NSA, or contractors, as was Snowden.
[02:17:10.107 --> 02:17:13.190]  Now, I know he went back and forth between contractor
[02:17:13.730 --> 02:17:16.591]  And, um, and government employee.
[02:17:17.911 --> 02:17:19.092]  They all say the same thing.
[02:17:19.212 --> 02:17:20.992]  There are abuses taking place.
[02:17:21.332 --> 02:17:30.575]  Mr. Binney, and Weeby, and Tice, and Tom Tam from the Justice Department, and Loomis, and so many others.
[02:17:30.635 --> 02:17:31.235]  Tom Drake.
[02:17:31.275 --> 02:17:32.755]  They've all come out and said the same thing.
[02:17:32.795 --> 02:17:35.336]  These were senior level people at NSA.
[02:17:35.376 --> 02:17:38.257]  So it's across the board that the abuses are happening.
[02:17:38.537 --> 02:17:41.198]  And you've got, what, General Alexander, who's, I think, now
[02:17:41.938 --> 02:17:44.761]  Probably the longest-serving director of NSA.
[02:17:44.801 --> 02:17:46.702]  Before him, it was General Hayden.
[02:17:47.062 --> 02:17:50.125]  You've got these guys that are becoming like the FBI director.
[02:17:50.525 --> 02:17:52.207]  Ten-year terms, it seems.
[02:17:52.467 --> 02:17:53.328]  You got Alexander.
[02:17:53.368 --> 02:17:56.170]  How many Bilderberg meetings did he attend in the past?
[02:17:56.210 --> 02:17:58.072]  He didn't go this year, but I counted them.
[02:17:58.312 --> 02:18:00.013]  He's gone to five in the past.
[02:18:00.554 --> 02:18:03.456]  So, he says he's loyal to the Constitution?
[02:18:03.876 --> 02:18:06.979]  Ah, it looks like he's more loyal to the bylaws of the Bilderberg Group.
[02:18:07.339 --> 02:18:14.968]  I've never seen an NSA director go to these groups, these foreign groups, where he's obviously violating the Logan Act.
[02:18:14.988 --> 02:18:18.352]  That's another act that ought to be enforced.
[02:18:18.432 --> 02:18:24.800]  These people can't conduct their own foreign policy, but he probably has a pass from Obama as he had a pass from Bush.
[02:18:25.880 --> 02:18:28.841]  The other thing is, people are attacking Snowden.
[02:18:28.861 --> 02:18:35.843]  They're saying, well, he couldn't have had all this access, and he worked at the CIA, and he worked here, and he said he made 200k.
[02:18:36.383 --> 02:18:39.244]  We know that these contractors raid other contractors.
[02:18:39.564 --> 02:18:42.845]  They get signing bonuses to go from one contractor to another.
[02:18:43.125 --> 02:18:47.746]  The people who are making these comments have no knowledge how the NSA world operates.
[02:18:47.786 --> 02:18:49.126]  They're complete morons.
[02:18:49.246 --> 02:18:50.887]  My dad was offered in the 80s.
[02:18:50.987 --> 02:18:51.227]  Yeah.
[02:18:52.547 --> 02:19:06.653]  Uh, like $400,000 a year as a oral surgeon, uh, to go work in black operations that involve, you know, planning things and spies, basically, he wasn't told more than that, and cybernetic type stuff.
[02:19:07.133 --> 02:19:09.694]  And I mean, that's like, that was like a million dollars back then.
[02:19:09.974 --> 02:19:19.578]  People have no idea that the low-level contractors now are getting like $100,000 a year just to do contract security, and that most of them are getting $200,000.
[02:19:21.161 --> 02:19:28.744]  Yeah, and there's something else about Snowden, why they're being very silent at the White House and why they're reacting so fiercely.
[02:19:29.845 --> 02:19:37.709]  Dianne Feinstein and this guy Peter King call him a traitor and saying that the reporters ought to be also prosecuted.
[02:19:38.609 --> 02:19:47.213]  There is, and I haven't written about this yet in light of the recent developments, but there is a group that is a joint NSA-CIA activity.
[02:19:47.353 --> 02:19:48.534]  It's known internally as F6.
[02:19:49.714 --> 02:19:52.415]  It's called the Special Collection Service.
[02:19:52.775 --> 02:19:57.916]  It's located in Beltsville, Maryland, not far from NSA headquarters.
[02:19:58.376 --> 02:20:01.817]  And what they do is they go abroad and put in bugs.
[02:20:02.457 --> 02:20:04.598]  They're like your James Bond type thing.
[02:20:04.618 --> 02:20:09.399]  So they have the technicians with NSA and then they got the CIA guys that facilitate this.
[02:20:10.099 --> 02:20:29.145]  These are black bag operators and the fact that Snowden was stationed in Misawa at the NSA base in Japan and he was in Cunea at what they call NSA Hawaii on the island of Oahu and that he worked at the CIA for a short time and said he he did some work in Switzerland and in other countries in Europe.
[02:20:29.985 --> 02:20:35.226]  He could in fact be the first whistleblower out of the Special Collections Service, F6.
[02:20:36.026 --> 02:20:37.487]  He wouldn't be the first one who
[02:20:38.047 --> 02:20:38.648]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:20:54.178 --> 02:20:55.419]  Yeah.
[02:20:55.759 --> 02:21:00.681]  Well, apparently there's a few reports that he actually has a list of people who are being surveilled.
[02:21:01.942 --> 02:21:03.842]  This has come out before.
[02:21:04.723 --> 02:21:08.004]  These leaks have happened over the last several decades.
[02:21:08.044 --> 02:21:13.467]  I remember there was a woman named Peg Newsham that worked at the NSA facility in Men With Ill in the UK.
[02:21:13.487 --> 02:21:14.687]  She was a contractor.
[02:21:14.968 --> 02:21:17.028]  I believe it was for Lockheed.
[02:21:18.089 --> 02:21:22.411]  But she said that she overheard Strom Thurmond talking on the phone.
[02:21:22.691 --> 02:21:31.100]  So when they talk about we don't target Americans, there is enough evidence that that's just patently false and general clapper.
[02:21:31.781 --> 02:21:36.306]  Like all these guys in the intelligence community, all they do is cover up when they're caught.
[02:21:36.687 --> 02:21:38.969]  Can you talk about what you did at the NSA?
[02:21:41.312 --> 02:21:41.552]  Sure.
[02:21:41.732 --> 02:21:48.620]  Well, I worked in communications security, so I was on the side of the NSA, which, you know, I mean, we have to protect our own communications.
[02:21:49.520 --> 02:21:52.544]  That's, I guess, pretty much the benign side of it.
[02:21:52.584 --> 02:21:57.249]  But I do know that anyone, because of operations security and communications security,
[02:21:57.609 --> 02:22:05.775]  That anyone who used a government telephone or used government computers was liable to be listening on by NSA.
[02:22:05.795 --> 02:22:06.896]  It's part of the deal.
[02:22:07.516 --> 02:22:13.080]  Even the president, because the president would speak on something called a secure telephone unit, NSA had the
[02:22:13.140 --> 02:22:14.961]  What do you think they'll try to do to him?
[02:22:38.101 --> 02:22:42.883]  Oh yeah, well, I hope he's got another plan.
[02:22:43.504 --> 02:22:45.645]  I would not want to see him stay in Hong Kong.
[02:22:46.685 --> 02:22:53.188]  I've made some efforts to try through intermediaries to get in touch with him if he's still in Hong Kong.
[02:22:53.228 --> 02:23:02.673]  There are other alternatives he should look at, but what the Justice Department will do is go to Interpol and get a red notice, an arrest warrant issued.
[02:23:03.933 --> 02:23:07.675]  The Secretary of State Kerry could revoke his passport, which would make him a stateless
[02:23:08.075 --> 02:23:08.475]  We're good.
[02:23:33.868 --> 02:23:38.395]  We've got Jones-Dottier, the member of the Icelandic Parliament, coming on Friday.
[02:23:38.775 --> 02:23:49.050]  She's trying to get him to go there, but if that's the case, he'll have to still hide out, because they'll just send a woman into his room to claim he raped her.
[02:23:50.051 --> 02:23:52.993]  Yeah, and the other thing about Iceland, there's a new right-wing government there.
[02:23:53.033 --> 02:23:59.397]  This isn't the former government that had this idea will become a free zone for information.
[02:23:59.677 --> 02:24:00.438]  It's a new government.
[02:24:00.498 --> 02:24:01.439]  It's a right-wing government.
[02:24:02.039 --> 02:24:03.360]  Iceland's a member of NATO.
[02:24:03.980 --> 02:24:06.902]  Some people suggested that he go to New Zealand.
[02:24:06.922 --> 02:24:10.364]  There's people there that said they would try to give him asylum.
[02:24:10.384 --> 02:24:13.286]  You know, you've got this mega-upload guy in New Zealand.
[02:24:13.647 --> 02:24:14.787]  What about Sweden?
[02:24:15.968 --> 02:24:18.149]  Yeah, I wouldn't recommend Sweden.
[02:24:18.709 --> 02:24:19.929]  WikiLeaks.
[02:24:20.569 --> 02:24:21.649]  Yeah, the WikiLeaks thing.
[02:24:21.910 --> 02:24:24.330]  There's not a whole lot of havens for us anymore.
[02:24:24.370 --> 02:24:25.210]  Is New Zealand good?
[02:24:25.230 --> 02:24:26.071]  I mean, where?
[02:24:26.931 --> 02:24:29.591]  Well, this guy MegaUpload, who the U.S.
[02:24:29.651 --> 02:24:37.313]  wants extradited for, you know, they say, oh, he stole some intellectual property from billionaires in Hollywood in the recording industry.
[02:24:37.934 --> 02:24:41.875]  The Supreme Court in New Zealand, apparently the courts have shot down that extradition request.
[02:24:42.155 --> 02:24:43.015]  So he's still there.
[02:24:43.635 --> 02:24:47.499]  Yeah, nowadays they would extradite Cervico and probably publicly hang him on television.
[02:24:47.979 --> 02:24:53.164]  I mean, this is a... I mean, how are things going for the New World Order right now?
[02:24:53.204 --> 02:25:00.991]  I mean, obviously they cannot be happy about everybody was starting to blow the whistle on them and the fact that they've been using the NSA against libertarian groups.
[02:25:01.854 --> 02:25:06.919]  Well, people are getting tired of the United States as the bull in the China shop.
[02:25:06.979 --> 02:25:18.710]  I think it was interesting just the other day that former Prime Minister of the Netherlands, Prime Minister Lubbers, said that he revealed that there's 22 US nuclear weapons at a NATO base in the Netherlands.
[02:25:19.051 --> 02:25:26.458]  Here's a case where the Dutch Air Force said he's not supposed to be talking like that.
[02:25:26.918 --> 02:25:28.819]  You know, this is a former Prime Minister.
[02:25:28.899 --> 02:25:32.260]  I think more and more people are willing to talk about these things.
[02:25:32.360 --> 02:25:40.843]  And as far as Mr. Snowden's concerned, he's one in a long line of people who have come forward.
[02:25:41.203 --> 02:25:48.025]  Remember in the lead up to the Iraq War, a woman at GCHQ, a Chinese linguist named Catherine Gunn,
[02:25:48.766 --> 02:25:49.467]  I think?
[02:26:04.666 --> 02:26:11.968]  Well, obviously the answer to this is not to lay down people to stand up, but take Sabel Edmonds, where it was white slavery, weapons, running Al-Qaeda.
[02:26:11.988 --> 02:26:12.628]  She exposed all that.
[02:26:12.668 --> 02:26:14.589]  We've got her coming on later in the week.
[02:26:32.873 --> 02:26:33.414]  Yeah.
[02:26:33.774 --> 02:26:35.415]  But we've got things like that unfolding.
[02:26:36.016 --> 02:26:41.141]  What if NSA people, you know, who know what the government's really doing, know what they're into?
[02:26:42.734 --> 02:26:46.616]  That's why a lot of the top government people have facilities they go to that have no technology in them.
[02:26:46.896 --> 02:26:49.617]  A lot of Hollywood people have now done that because they understand it.
[02:26:50.098 --> 02:27:01.963]  I mean, if I was corrupt globalist, I would not have 800,000 contractors with access to top secret stuff and hundreds of thousands that can dial into anything.
[02:27:02.383 --> 02:27:08.726]  I mean, that just sounds like a recipe for disaster and something that would burn the establishment.
[02:27:09.526 --> 02:27:14.169]  Because next time it's not going to be NSA leakers that are just releasing that they're spying on people.
[02:27:14.569 --> 02:27:26.315]  You're going to end up having NSA people, I know they've got snoopers that try to pick up on this, that are going to use this to expose dark side government and narcotics trafficking, snuff filming, all the stuff these guys are into.
[02:27:27.135 --> 02:27:31.898]  So what's your take on that and what are you hearing from your whistleblower sources?
[02:27:32.850 --> 02:27:41.717]  Well, you know, it's not been easy for whistleblowers or members of the press recently because, as you said, Obama has invoked the Espionage Act of 1917.
[02:27:42.138 --> 02:27:54.548]  This was invoked by Woodrow Wilson to go after people who did not support the war effort against Germany, and that was a needless war for us to get into on behalf of the British Empire in the First World War.
[02:27:56.309 --> 02:27:57.870]  But he's invoked it six times.
[02:27:58.231 --> 02:28:07.017]  There are grand juries now impaneled on several other people that I'm aware of, whistleblowers and members of the press.
[02:28:07.397 --> 02:28:13.442]  We had Peter King saying he wants to go after Glenn Greenwald and Bart Gelman from the Washington Post.
[02:28:13.462 --> 02:28:15.624]  This is after what they've done with the AP.
[02:28:15.924 --> 02:28:21.028]  Alex, last week I was at the Radio and TV Correspondence Center in Washington, D.C.
[02:28:21.088 --> 02:28:23.149]  Obama spoke there in 2009.
[02:28:23.409 --> 02:28:25.371]  This is not to be confused with the White House press.
[02:28:27.712 --> 02:28:30.593]  That's the big Hollywood Glitterati one in April.
[02:28:30.633 --> 02:28:33.013]  This is the one where the real working journalists are present.
[02:28:33.674 --> 02:28:36.234]  Obama did not even RSVP them.
[02:28:37.215 --> 02:28:38.495]  They called all afternoon.
[02:28:39.235 --> 02:28:43.537]  And he didn't send, last year he sent Biden, he didn't send anyone from the administration.
[02:28:44.137 --> 02:28:46.019]  I said, hey, what's going on here?
[02:28:46.379 --> 02:28:48.480]  Is Obama, does he want a war with the media?
[02:28:48.741 --> 02:28:50.782]  And the answer was, yeah, obviously.
[02:28:51.062 --> 02:28:52.023]  And look what's happened.
[02:28:52.223 --> 02:28:55.486]  Now we have a leak of a State Department internal report that the U.S.
[02:28:55.526 --> 02:29:02.411]  ambassador to Belgium is reputedly not only chasing hookers in Brussels parks, but children.
[02:29:02.871 --> 02:29:03.631]  A pedophile!
[02:29:03.711 --> 02:29:04.531]  Right, exactly!
[02:29:04.871 --> 02:29:08.092]  So why do you, you know, what are they concerned about with leaks?
[02:29:08.512 --> 02:29:15.893]  This is exactly, and I'm glad, I could gloat and say, look, I report a cute group and I report all this years ago, but you know what?
[02:29:16.013 --> 02:29:20.574]  I welcome the fact that the corporate media is now focusing on these stories.
[02:29:20.634 --> 02:29:23.314]  I'm not going to gloat, I'm not going to say, I told you so.
[02:29:23.455 --> 02:29:30.376]  I welcome them, you know, I could say, I welcome them waking up to smell the coffee, but I'm sincere in that.
[02:29:30.416 --> 02:29:31.936]  I'm glad they're looking into it.
[02:29:32.679 --> 02:29:36.341]  Alright, I want to come back and take some phone calls with listeners that want to talk to Wayne Madsen.
[02:29:36.461 --> 02:29:44.647]  Aaron, Devoted Allies, Simon, Harvey, Dugall, we're going to get to all of you who want to talk about this NSA situation.
[02:29:45.007 --> 02:29:49.230]  Straight ahead with former NSA officer Wayne Madsen.

[02:29:51.791 --> 02:29:53.392]  The Empire's on the run.

[02:30:37.648 --> 02:30:41.592]  Chinese are offering $4.7 billion to buy our largest pork producer.

[02:32:55.443 --> 02:33:06.291]  In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem.
[02:33:07.252 --> 02:33:08.853]  Government is the problem.
[02:33:11.775 --> 02:33:18.561]  From time to time, we've been tempted to believe that society has become too complex to be managed by self-rule.
[02:33:19.468 --> 02:33:26.630]  The government by an elite group is superior to government for, by, and of the people.
[02:33:27.551 --> 02:33:29.271]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:29.651 --> 02:33:32.652]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[02:33:33.993 --> 02:33:34.793]  Hello me.
[02:33:35.173 --> 02:33:36.374]  Meet the real me.
[02:33:36.614 --> 02:33:39.054]  In my misfits way of life.
[02:33:39.475 --> 02:33:42.055]  A dark black past is mine.
[02:33:42.275 --> 02:33:43.316]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[02:33:45.419 --> 02:33:50.821]  Obama calls the Constitution Charter of Negative Liberties.
[02:33:53.022 --> 02:33:54.862]  So now he has openly come out.
[02:33:55.342 --> 02:33:56.623]  Let's get the video of that.
[02:33:57.363 --> 02:33:59.644]  And actually said the Constitution is enslaving him.
[02:34:01.144 --> 02:34:04.325]  Don't worry, it's already all been thrown out the window and look at all the bad stuff that's happening.
[02:34:04.686 --> 02:34:08.827]  DHS wants equipment for riot control stations.
[02:34:09.627 --> 02:34:11.408]  Yeah, I told you that from one of our
[02:34:13.427 --> 02:34:14.447]  TSA sources.
[02:34:15.128 --> 02:34:22.030]  First I was told it by a caller who worked at a big warehouse in Oklahoma and then I got contacted by a source above TSA.
[02:34:22.550 --> 02:34:24.471]  I'll just say it's one of the companies that manages them.
[02:34:24.491 --> 02:34:25.311]  They have contractors.
[02:34:26.011 --> 02:34:32.693]  And they said last year they're deploying these riot control stations and they're going to have TSA all over the place.
[02:34:32.733 --> 02:34:33.354]  We broke that.
[02:34:33.414 --> 02:34:34.354]  We had an article about it.
[02:34:34.874 --> 02:34:35.294]  Boom!
[02:34:35.314 --> 02:34:36.114]  That just came out.
[02:34:36.335 --> 02:34:39.296]  Bombshell on InfoWars.com.
[02:34:41.089 --> 02:34:44.190]  Northern Colorado, ready to secede over intrusive government.
[02:34:44.910 --> 02:34:45.710]  That's another article.
[02:34:45.751 --> 02:34:47.891]  That's what the riot police are for.
[02:34:48.571 --> 02:34:52.973]  See, they implode the society, then use the crisis as the pretext to clamp down.
[02:34:52.993 --> 02:34:58.455]  DHS-funded exercises portrays free American citizens as terrorists seldom.
[02:34:59.815 --> 02:35:01.135]  That's a big article.
[02:35:01.195 --> 02:35:08.538]  In the Boston Globe, two months before the bombing, they were going to have a drill of people with backpacks bombing a public event who were from the right-wing
[02:35:09.670 --> 02:35:10.711]  Tea Party Militia.
[02:35:11.492 --> 02:35:19.659]  And they were going to go with that, and then we found out about the drills, so they backed off and went with the Chechen Brothers.
[02:35:20.380 --> 02:35:28.167]  I want to get back into the NSA and calls here with you, Wayne, but I really shook them up, and my listeners did, and the radio show did.
[02:35:28.187 --> 02:35:31.751]  And they've got articles how we got seven-fold record traffic.
[02:35:31.811 --> 02:35:32.311]  I mean, we had
[02:35:33.488 --> 02:35:35.791]  One day, like, it was a ridiculous number.
[02:35:35.811 --> 02:35:40.318]  The analytics said like 12 million visitors to one site and 5 million or something to the other.
[02:35:40.338 --> 02:35:41.139]  It was just insane.
[02:35:41.159 --> 02:35:44.123]  We used to get like a million visitors or something.
[02:35:47.711 --> 02:35:55.157]  I'm sitting there looking at that and now they've got Bloomberg coming out two days ago saying Alex Jones doesn't build bombs, he builds bombers.
[02:35:55.798 --> 02:36:00.301]  And they have all these people saying Alex Jones is a terrorist and Alex Jones is dangerous.
[02:36:00.902 --> 02:36:07.407]  They had a drill, the brothers it turned out were being sent overseas to CIA meetings for destabilization programs.
[02:36:07.447 --> 02:36:08.928]  That all came out.
[02:36:09.249 --> 02:36:11.591]  They've killed two FBI agents that were involved in their arrest.
[02:36:11.991 --> 02:36:14.073]  They've killed one of the friends, shooting him in the top of the head.
[02:36:15.518 --> 02:36:18.188]  Wayne Madsen from your sources now on Hindsight.
[02:36:19.758 --> 02:36:22.561]  Uh, what are they so scared of in the Boston bombing?
[02:36:22.581 --> 02:36:25.944]  You've got these Saudi nationals being protected and Michelle visiting them.
[02:36:26.364 --> 02:36:35.091]  We're now in hindsight, what best, I mean, all I know is they're lying, there's evidence of an operation, there was a drill, they're covering it up, they're saying don't look at it.
[02:36:35.512 --> 02:36:36.553]  It's the classic MO.
[02:36:36.653 --> 02:36:39.955]  We don't know exactly what they did, at least, at least I don't.
[02:36:40.016 --> 02:36:46.741]  From all your sources on Capitol Hill, Wayne, what do we best know now in hindsight about the Boston bombing and why now?
[02:36:47.942 --> 02:36:59.608]  Are they in a conniption fit with 15, 20 hit pieces a day, investigative journalists crawling all over me trying to find dirt or manufacturing it, and saying I'm a terrorist?
[02:36:59.648 --> 02:37:02.050]  I mean, they've never come out and said that.
[02:37:02.730 --> 02:37:04.111]  Should I be worried here, Wayne?
[02:37:05.222 --> 02:37:08.363]  Well, we all have to be worried because look what they're doing to Ed Snowden.
[02:37:08.523 --> 02:37:13.686]  I mean, we're all subject to that type of psychological warfare campaign.
[02:37:14.106 --> 02:37:16.547]  I have a story up today on the website.
[02:37:17.888 --> 02:37:20.389]  We know that the Sarnia brothers
[02:37:21.429 --> 02:37:36.101]  Tamerlan and Zohar, that their uncle, Uncle Ruslan, who changed his name from Tsarny to Tsarny, worked and actually was the ex-son-in-law of a former CIA guy named Graham Fuller.
[02:37:36.422 --> 02:37:48.952]  Now all of that was reported on Graham Fuller, who he was actually doing business with, setting up these Chechen NGOs, some of which were accused of being linked to terrorism against Russia.
[02:37:50.353 --> 02:37:54.194]  We were told, oh, Graham Fuller, he was a station chief of the CIA in Kabul.
[02:37:54.635 --> 02:38:16.005]  I have documents that I just yanked recently from CIA sources that show that Graham Fuller was a right-hand man of William Casey, Bill Casey, the architect of Iran-Contra, the guy who, you know, gave a deathbed interview, supposedly, to Bob Woodward, if you can believe that.
[02:38:17.105 --> 02:38:20.868]  But it clearly shows that I've scanned these documents in.
[02:38:21.188 --> 02:38:32.675]  You can see that in one case, Bill Casey was getting ready to go meet with President Reagan at what they call a National Policy Security Group meeting in the White House Situation Room.
[02:38:32.955 --> 02:38:36.637]  And before Casey went to talk to Reagan, he talked to Graham Fuller.
[02:38:37.057 --> 02:38:41.519]  That's not a low-level guide by any stretch at the CIA.
[02:38:42.119 --> 02:38:57.365]  I was also informed that Graham Fuller in 1987 was very instrumental in Israel setting up a counterpart to the Fatah, the PLO, the Yassir Arafat's organization, and we know that group now as Hamas.
[02:38:58.866 --> 02:39:04.548]  We see the CIA time and time again involved in terrorism themselves.
[02:39:04.688 --> 02:39:06.529]  That was the fake Al Qaeda network.
[02:39:06.589 --> 02:39:12.252]  I mean, even the Jerusalem Post admits Israel created in, what, 1974 a fake group to create the threat.
[02:39:15.822 --> 02:39:19.403]  Right, and we know that the CIA, where did the Al-Qaeda resources come from?
[02:39:19.423 --> 02:39:24.324]  The Mujahideen that the CIA supported in the war against the Soviets in Afghanistan.
[02:39:25.264 --> 02:39:37.667]  We see this time and time again, the Kosovo Liberation Army, a terrorist group, and now their former leader is the Prime Minister of Kosovo, he's also Madeleine Albright's, her one-time toy boy.
[02:39:38.187 --> 02:39:44.291]  Uh, you know, I mean, you look at this stuff and, you know, you've got the toy boys, you've got the pederasts.
[02:39:44.591 --> 02:39:45.812]  What are they trying to cover up?
[02:39:46.192 --> 02:39:47.453]  This is what they're trying to cover up.
[02:39:47.793 --> 02:39:52.876]  We also know that the State Department's been accused of running drugs out of some of the embassies.
[02:39:52.936 --> 02:39:54.017]  There, there's a shocker.
[02:39:54.037 --> 02:39:57.239]  Uh, you know, this government is absolutely corrupt.
[02:39:57.559 --> 02:39:58.420]  And I used to teach
[02:39:59.200 --> 02:40:01.682]  Uh, security courses for the Navy.
[02:40:02.102 --> 02:40:20.595]  And one thing I always said is if you, a computer security officer at a command, discover something, whether it's financial fraud or something against the law, it's not only your right, it's your duty if you can't get anyone like the IG or the command to take care of it.
[02:40:20.615 --> 02:40:22.156]  It's your duty to expose it.
[02:40:22.256 --> 02:40:25.158]  And I mean that as much today as I did that.
[02:40:25.198 --> 02:40:27.940]  And by the way, correct me if I'm wrong, but I've studied the history of it.
[02:40:27.960 --> 02:40:28.440]  You lived it.
[02:40:28.921 --> 02:40:31.548]  Up until the last decade, that's what you're supposed to do.
[02:40:32.010 --> 02:40:34.978]  You become complicit if your chain of command doesn't do the right thing.
[02:40:35.569 --> 02:40:43.452]  Exactly, and as many whistleblowers have stated, the General Counsel, the Inspector General, and even the Congress.
[02:40:43.472 --> 02:40:44.413]  You look at NSA.
[02:40:44.713 --> 02:40:47.314]  Who's the congressman that represents Fort Meade, Maryland?
[02:40:47.534 --> 02:40:49.095]  His name is Dutch Ruppersberger.
[02:40:49.135 --> 02:40:52.637]  He's a Democrat, but he's one of these denotypes.
[02:40:52.877 --> 02:40:54.397]  He's on the NSA payroll!
[02:40:54.978 --> 02:40:57.599]  You look at Dianne Feinstein.
[02:40:57.719 --> 02:40:58.419]  Who's her husband?
[02:40:58.439 --> 02:40:59.039]  Richard Bloom.
[02:40:59.059 --> 02:41:00.320]  He's a war profiteer.
[02:41:01.601 --> 02:41:07.645]  He owns these major, he's got investments in these major intelligence and military companies.
[02:41:08.565 --> 02:41:14.389]  And Peter King, I mean this guy used to donate money to the provisional wing of the IRA, the Irish Republican Army.
[02:41:14.829 --> 02:41:19.972]  He's got a lot of nerve accusing people being, you know, helping terrorists and being traitors.
[02:41:20.473 --> 02:41:22.214]  This guy, King, ought to be thrown out.
[02:41:22.274 --> 02:41:26.717]  But you've got to look at who's electing guys like Ruppersberger and Peter King.
[02:41:26.737 --> 02:41:29.739]  Well that's the thing, when you look at these guys, they are gangsters.
[02:41:30.619 --> 02:41:31.900]  And you're up there on Capitol Hill.
[02:41:31.940 --> 02:41:33.280]  I've been around some of these guys before.
[02:41:33.340 --> 02:41:36.581]  They are arrogant thugs, and I'm sick of their garbage.
[02:41:37.321 --> 02:41:46.944]  Yeah, every time I go up there, I make sure my button on my back pocket is buttoned because, you know, these guys will lift your wallet in a New York heartbeat.
[02:41:47.506 --> 02:41:51.708]  Now I want to go to some phone calls and get to some other news here with you, but one point I wanted to raise.
[02:41:51.848 --> 02:42:01.653]  Russia may deem civil servants' use of Gmail, that's Google Mail folks, and Facebook high treason, and the Russians have come out and said Google, Facebook are basically NSA fronts.
[02:42:01.673 --> 02:42:05.655]  Well, that's been declassified, so the American people need to understand
[02:42:06.755 --> 02:42:10.877]  That foreign governments tell people, don't even talk to your wife on Gmail.
[02:42:11.417 --> 02:42:12.818]  And people say, well, what do I have to hide?
[02:42:13.078 --> 02:42:14.659]  They could plant stuff on there.
[02:42:15.579 --> 02:42:18.181]  From your research, who is Google?
[02:42:18.221 --> 02:42:19.041]  Who is Facebook?
[02:42:19.061 --> 02:42:24.584]  I mean, from my research, it's not just that they work with the government, they were created by the government.
[02:42:25.575 --> 02:42:33.457]  Yeah, Google and Oracle actually were codenames of R&D programs within the CIA many, many years ago.
[02:42:33.877 --> 02:42:35.877]  And the CIA has a group called In-Q-Tel.
[02:42:36.157 --> 02:42:38.738]  They actually go out and look for start-up companies.
[02:42:38.798 --> 02:42:41.278]  They'll pump a few million in.
[02:42:41.858 --> 02:42:48.800]  This Polentier that is now reported to be the company that developed the PRISM system started in 2004.
[02:42:50.300 --> 02:42:55.421]  With a $2 million seed contract from the CIA, they're now worth $2 billion.
[02:42:55.461 --> 02:42:56.841]  Where did they get $2 billion?
[02:42:57.021 --> 02:43:11.684]  Because an agency like the NSA gave them these huge contracts, and I thought it was very interesting that their CEO, Alex Karp, was President Bilderberg, the one over in England, where you were there.
[02:43:11.764 --> 02:43:12.104]  That's right.
[02:43:12.144 --> 02:43:19.326]  Let's go further, though, and then how it works is the CIA will put $2 million, $10 million into a company, give it contracts after that,
[02:43:20.424 --> 02:43:29.060]  And then lo and behold, five years later, CIA guys go into private practice and they get jobs at Google making 50 mil a year.
[02:43:29.080 --> 02:43:32.687]  Oh, isn't that just cute?
[02:43:33.530 --> 02:43:34.410]  Yeah.
[02:43:34.430 --> 02:43:36.711]  Well, these are the new contractors.
[02:43:36.771 --> 02:43:45.652]  In the old days, you know, it was always RCA and Boeing computer systems and, you know, but it's the same revolving door.
[02:43:46.173 --> 02:43:48.973]  The only way to get rid of this system is to get rid of the system.
[02:43:49.853 --> 02:43:51.674]  You know, I mean, it's that simple.
[02:43:52.474 --> 02:43:56.515]  You know, they talk about, well, we need to revise the Patriot Act.
[02:43:56.595 --> 02:43:58.435]  No, get rid of the darn Patriot Act.
[02:43:58.595 --> 02:43:59.215]  Here's the deal.
[02:43:59.235 --> 02:44:03.077]  They want us all to line up like prisoners and to have no due process.
[02:44:03.437 --> 02:44:05.758]  They're the ones staging the al-Qaeda garbage.
[02:44:06.178 --> 02:44:09.940]  They're the ones groping us at the airport and having the toilet safety to police there.
[02:44:10.360 --> 02:44:16.383]  They're the ones ruining our future, trying to force vaccines in us, trying to push psychotropic drugs on school kids.
[02:44:16.663 --> 02:44:18.563]  They are a pack of lunatic scum.
[02:44:18.984 --> 02:44:21.585]  You work in and around these people most of your adult life.
[02:44:22.385 --> 02:44:26.906]  And the thing that just keeps popping up is they're pedophiles, or they're devil worshippers, or they're sadists.
[02:44:27.246 --> 02:44:29.007]  I mean, who are these people really?
[02:44:29.027 --> 02:44:30.727]  Because they don't want to just steal money.
[02:44:30.967 --> 02:44:32.327]  They want to hurt goodness.
[02:44:32.808 --> 02:44:34.268]  That's why I'm so committed against them.
[02:44:34.488 --> 02:44:37.049]  It's not like they're Boss Hogg, just wanting to steal some money.
[02:44:37.409 --> 02:44:40.349]  I would fight that, but not, you know, to the death.
[02:44:40.850 --> 02:44:41.890]  I would try to expose it.
[02:44:42.110 --> 02:44:43.890]  But I mean, these people are so evil.
[02:44:44.270 --> 02:44:44.951]  Who are they?
[02:44:45.211 --> 02:44:46.551]  I mean, why are they so bad?
[02:44:47.298 --> 02:44:48.339]  Well, they're exceptional.
[02:44:48.460 --> 02:44:50.502]  I mean, they consider themselves to be exceptional.
[02:44:50.542 --> 02:44:51.824]  They are the elite.
[02:44:51.844 --> 02:44:53.767]  You know, you mentioned Mao earlier, Chairman Mao.
[02:44:54.027 --> 02:45:01.857]  Well, one of the things he did with the Cultural Revolution back in the 60s, you know, he took all their government people and paraded them in the street.
[02:45:02.418 --> 02:45:09.941]  In some cases, stripped them down to their underwear, made them wear dunce caps, and then the people, the Chinese people, like whacked them with bamboo sticks.
[02:45:10.242 --> 02:45:12.463]  Wouldn't you love to do that on Constitution Avenue?
[02:45:12.703 --> 02:45:19.766]  Have like one parade out of Congress, running down towards the White House, and then getting the other ones coming out of the White House on the way back?
[02:45:20.666 --> 02:45:28.708]  You know, I'm not saying we need that type of thing, but we do need a cleansing of these people.
[02:45:28.768 --> 02:45:31.049]  These people are absolutely horrible.
[02:45:32.169 --> 02:45:33.529]  I've met with them, I know some of them.
[02:45:33.749 --> 02:45:44.192]  Some of them are well-intentioned when they become members of Congress, but it doesn't take long before they start getting sticky fingers and start looking out for themselves instead of the people they were elected to represent.
[02:45:44.212 --> 02:45:45.832]  As best you know though,
[02:45:48.394 --> 02:45:49.375]  Talking to whistleblowers.
[02:45:49.515 --> 02:45:51.377]  Are more of them planning to go public right now?
[02:45:51.917 --> 02:45:54.099]  Had you ever heard of Snowden before he went public?
[02:45:54.940 --> 02:45:59.744]  I never heard of Snowden, but I'm not surprised that somebody like him came forward.
[02:46:00.305 --> 02:46:00.745]  What's going on?
[02:46:00.785 --> 02:46:02.066]  What's happening now in NSA?
[02:46:02.126 --> 02:46:04.849]  Is it really drilling down once again?
[02:46:04.949 --> 02:46:09.253]  Or, you know, you don't talk, you sign an oath and they're letting them know what, you
[02:46:09.633 --> 02:46:11.415]  You know, how many years they could face in prison.
[02:46:12.176 --> 02:46:15.579]  So that's going to have some effect in the short term.
[02:46:15.979 --> 02:46:25.729]  But as these people get more bold with these systems, this Utah data center that's going to come online in September, that's going to be the big mother load of data.
[02:46:26.770 --> 02:46:43.418]  This is the old, by the way, this is the old trusted information awareness system that Admiral Poindexter tried to get started at the Homeland Security Department years ago, and when I was with the Electronic Privacy Information Center, we actually submitted a FOIA request on how extensive that was.
[02:46:44.058 --> 02:46:50.661]  We won that in court before Judge Bates and the District of Columbia, and when the information came out on how extensive it was,
[02:46:51.021 --> 02:46:58.326]  Congress cut off the funding, but I heard then that what they did is Homeland Security just turned it over to NSA to implement, and look what they've done.
[02:46:58.346 --> 02:46:59.967]  They've implemented, it's called PRISM.
[02:47:00.287 --> 02:47:05.431]  It's going to be largely housed at that Utah data center that's 17th football field.
[02:47:05.491 --> 02:47:11.575]  Well, they've got a giant one in San Antonio, and then they've got one outside Austin.
[02:47:13.436 --> 02:47:15.698]  They're building all sorts of little private ones.
[02:47:16.181 --> 02:47:28.648]  Oak Ridge, Tennessee, there's a new one there, and there's a $780 million complex going into Fort Meade, which is going to be yet an additional facility at Fort Meade at the NSA headquarters campus.
[02:47:29.268 --> 02:47:34.251]  And then you've got CUNEA in Hawaii, that's a new building that does eavesdropping.
[02:47:34.271 --> 02:47:42.215]  Sure, we're going to take calls now, but Wayne Madsen, anything else you want to add that after you're gone you wish you would have had time to talk about?
[02:47:42.955 --> 02:48:03.753]  Well, I just think that what people have to do is get on these members of Congress that are calling Snowden a traitor and let them know that we the people determine who the traitors are, not people like Peter King who supported Irish terrorism blowing up subway trains in London.
[02:48:04.353 --> 02:48:05.354]  Uh, and certainly not.
[02:48:33.953 --> 02:48:34.873]  Bill Maher is a pig!
[02:49:00.183 --> 02:49:00.904]  Well, wait a minute.
[02:49:00.924 --> 02:49:01.505]  A comedian?
[02:49:01.525 --> 02:49:04.068]  A comedian is telling me about NSA systems?
[02:49:04.108 --> 02:49:05.830]  What does Gilbert Gottfried have to say?
[02:49:05.890 --> 02:49:06.471]  Chris Rock?
[02:49:06.511 --> 02:49:07.532]  How about Jackie Greene?
[02:49:07.752 --> 02:49:09.094]  Why don't they ask them while they're at it?
[02:49:09.935 --> 02:49:12.438]  Well, Chris Rock says Obama's our father and do what he says.
[02:49:12.458 --> 02:49:15.241]  I heard that before in Germany.
[02:49:15.842 --> 02:49:17.964]  Aaron in Nevada, you're on the air.
[02:49:18.024 --> 02:49:18.505]  Go ahead.
[02:49:18.765 --> 02:49:19.066]  Welcome.
[02:49:21.647 --> 02:49:26.472]  Thank you, Alex, and congratulations on your great reception in the United Kingdom there, man.
[02:49:26.492 --> 02:49:27.754]  That was really great.
[02:49:27.974 --> 02:49:29.135]  Believe me, it was phenomenal.
[02:49:29.155 --> 02:49:30.377]  It really shows people are waking up.
[02:49:31.513 --> 02:49:37.117]  All right, by the way, Bill Casey did not give a deathbed confession, so Madsen is really kind of irrelevant at this point.
[02:49:37.717 --> 02:49:39.458]  Snowden is a great American.
[02:49:39.558 --> 02:49:40.659]  Let's just be clear about that.
[02:49:40.959 --> 02:49:41.620]  Hey, wait a minute.
[02:49:41.660 --> 02:49:42.420]  Wait a minute, Aaron.
[02:49:43.261 --> 02:49:44.922]  I mean, Madsen doesn't make stuff up.
[02:49:45.763 --> 02:49:50.506]  I mean, I vaguely remember... I mean, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[02:49:50.846 --> 02:49:51.807]  Back up what you're saying.
[02:49:52.839 --> 02:49:53.159]  Go ahead.
[02:49:53.299 --> 02:49:53.820]  I'll do that.
[02:49:54.180 --> 02:50:01.644]  Bill Casey was found dead in his backyard pond, face down in the water, so Bill Casey could not give a deathbed confession.
[02:50:01.665 --> 02:50:02.025]  Sure, sure.
[02:50:02.045 --> 02:50:02.885]  It was a kayak.
[02:50:03.386 --> 02:50:04.406]  Expand on that.
[02:50:04.646 --> 02:50:07.228]  I think you're confusing Bill Casey with Bill Colby.
[02:50:09.389 --> 02:50:09.569]  Yeah.
[02:50:09.950 --> 02:50:10.490]  Two different people.
[02:50:11.431 --> 02:50:11.651]  Okay.
[02:50:11.991 --> 02:50:12.331]  Anyways.
[02:50:13.112 --> 02:50:14.392]  So you want to apologize, Dwayne?
[02:50:15.353 --> 02:50:16.994]  Okay, I'm sorry, Mr. Madsen.
[02:50:17.074 --> 02:50:18.615]  Great work on the other
[02:50:19.847 --> 02:50:21.208]  I'm not trying to be a jerk here.
[02:50:21.268 --> 02:50:22.450]  I get names mixed up too.
[02:50:22.850 --> 02:50:26.253]  I apologize when I call the Thames the... I mean the Thames the Thames.
[02:50:27.034 --> 02:50:28.676]  It gets confusing.
[02:50:29.556 --> 02:50:31.739]  POTAK is the one... I got this name right.
[02:50:31.879 --> 02:50:36.323]  POTAK is the one who made those defamatory statements about you not being
[02:50:38.012 --> 02:50:38.432]  Well, stay there.
[02:50:38.452 --> 02:50:39.392]  I'm going to come back to you.
[02:50:39.833 --> 02:50:40.213]  No, no.
[02:50:41.193 --> 02:50:43.094]  I had discussions with them about that statement.
[02:50:43.614 --> 02:50:49.056]  And I said, if you put that in there, you've got to put in there that one of their guys went and shot up the Family Research Council.
[02:50:49.556 --> 02:50:53.917]  And they also have quotes about how I influenced the Czarnev brothers.
[02:50:53.957 --> 02:50:54.937]  So don't try... No.
[02:50:55.378 --> 02:50:55.938]  The article...
[02:50:56.858 --> 02:50:59.620]  ...is written to imply that I'm a terrorist.
[02:50:59.680 --> 02:51:00.781]  Stay there, I'll come back to you.
[02:51:01.581 --> 02:51:05.124]  Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins.
[02:51:05.464 --> 02:51:06.184]  That bears repeating.
[02:51:06.505 --> 02:51:10.027]  Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins.
[02:51:10.387 --> 02:51:14.650]  And Pro-EM-1 Daily Probiotic Cleanse is the key to digestive health.

[02:52:04.048 --> 02:52:10.076]  Alex and I want to thank you for the generous support of the Oklahoma food donations pouring in every day.
[02:52:10.477 --> 02:52:13.080]  In just six days, over 37,000 servings have been shipped.

[02:52:22.469 --> 02:52:26.050]  Please keep Oklahoma important, but we've got serious food issues.
[02:52:26.410 --> 02:52:36.894]  For example, the rising cost of food, especially beef, last year's worst drought in 50 years, and the mandated ethanol production has dried up the feed supply for livestock.
[02:52:37.274 --> 02:52:41.196]  Chinese are offering $4.7 billion to buy our largest pork producer.

[02:53:00.552 --> 02:53:08.620]  Hi, my name is Annette and due to menopause symptoms for nearly two years, I suffered severe hot flashes which prevented me from sleeping all night.
[02:53:08.920 --> 02:53:13.204]  It was so hard to work because I continued all day to have the hot flashes from hell.
[02:53:13.424 --> 02:53:15.526]  I was exhausted and depleted.
[02:53:15.867 --> 02:53:20.731]  After only three weeks on One World Way, I have no hot flashes and I'm sleeping normally again.
[02:53:20.751 --> 02:53:23.033]  I feel energized and strong.
[02:53:23.494 --> 02:53:24.775]  This is an amazing product.
[02:53:24.935 --> 02:53:31.259]  It is a little known fact that every single cell of your body is supposed to produce 10% of its protein content as glutathione.
[02:53:31.359 --> 02:53:34.061]  But due to toxicity and aging, it does not.
[02:53:34.261 --> 02:53:38.284]  Could glutathione be a missing factor in optimal cell function for your entire body?
[02:53:38.544 --> 02:53:45.449]  If you restore the optimal glutathione levels in your cells, especially your glands and organs, then as a result, your glands and organs work better.
[02:53:45.749 --> 02:53:48.331]  Imagine the quality of life improvement you might have.
[02:53:48.491 --> 02:53:50.112]  To order One World Way, call 888-988-3325.
[02:54:03.444 --> 02:54:06.888]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're back live here up on InfoWars.com.
[02:54:06.948 --> 02:54:15.377]  A public government training camp has upheld the suspension of a child who was eating their Pop-Tart and students thought it looked like a gun.
[02:54:17.093 --> 02:54:26.520]  Doesn't even look like the shape of a gun, but now, you know, if your Twinkie has the imprint, not of the Virgin Mary, but of the gun, you're taking him away.
[02:54:26.540 --> 02:54:28.521]  I mean, it's just all thought crime.
[02:54:28.581 --> 02:54:30.683]  Everything they're doing is about authoritarianism.
[02:54:31.143 --> 02:54:38.749]  I want to jam in your calls now and in the next segment, and then we're going to end the main transmission at Whistleblowers tonight, 7 o'clock Central, from Telecom and Government.
[02:54:40.216 --> 02:54:41.497]  So you don't want to miss that information.
[02:54:41.537 --> 02:54:42.277]  It's very important.
[02:54:42.317 --> 02:54:44.859]  WayneMadsenReport.com is our guest site.
[02:54:44.899 --> 02:54:45.479]  You should go there.

[02:54:55.925 --> 02:54:56.606]  Go after POTAC.
[02:54:56.626 --> 02:54:58.647]  Get yourself a good defamation lawyer.
[02:55:20.572 --> 02:55:21.413]  And go after him.
[02:55:21.633 --> 02:55:23.814]  Bankrupt the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[02:55:23.854 --> 02:55:24.394]  You could do it.
[02:55:24.414 --> 02:55:27.656]  That's a defamation per se what he said about you.
[02:55:27.977 --> 02:55:34.340]  He went over the line of that you're a public figure type of thing into defamation per se.
[02:55:34.420 --> 02:55:34.761]  I know.
[02:55:34.821 --> 02:55:35.521]  I'm looking at it.
[02:55:36.502 --> 02:55:43.286]  If I sue somebody, I'll have to get the right lawyer, spend the money, do it all right to get a judgment.
[02:55:46.629 --> 02:55:48.872]  And I've got to send them letters and make them retract it.
[02:55:49.954 --> 02:55:53.078]  My point is, for them to do stuff like that means they're desperate.
[02:55:53.659 --> 02:55:58.166]  Especially when the Southern Broadway Law Center was running Elohim City where McVeigh was at.
[02:55:58.546 --> 02:56:00.108]  Wayne Madsen, you got any comments on that?
[02:56:01.400 --> 02:56:08.564]  Well, I mean, yeah, I, you know, suing, I had to get a thick skin after doing this for a few years.
[02:56:09.064 --> 02:56:11.246]  I mean, you know, let them take their best shot, you know?
[02:56:11.266 --> 02:56:11.826]  Who cares?
[02:56:11.906 --> 02:56:17.449]  I mean... No, I hear you, but I mean, for them to say that I'm building bombers, that is outrageous.
[02:56:17.669 --> 02:56:18.430]  That is outrageous.
[02:56:19.490 --> 02:56:20.031]  I know.
[02:56:20.631 --> 02:56:24.054]  But the one thing they do like to do is to get you tied up in court.
[02:56:24.154 --> 02:56:25.235]  No, no, I agree.
[02:56:25.275 --> 02:56:26.196]  Maybe that's the plan.
[02:56:26.256 --> 02:56:27.837]  No, I tend to not sue people.
[02:56:28.117 --> 02:56:30.579]  You mess with my family, though, I'll come after you.
[02:56:31.059 --> 02:56:32.180]  Listen, I appreciate the call, Aaron.
[02:56:32.220 --> 02:56:34.282]  Let's talk to Harvey in Florida.
[02:56:34.302 --> 02:56:34.762]  You're on the air.
[02:56:34.782 --> 02:56:35.363]  Go ahead, Harvey.
[02:56:37.244 --> 02:56:37.845]  Hey, Alex.
[02:56:37.925 --> 02:56:40.026]  It's been a long time since I've spoken with you.
[02:56:40.226 --> 02:56:42.788]  And Wayne, you're like a wealth of knowledge.
[02:56:42.808 --> 02:56:44.590]  You're like an encyclopedia of history.
[02:56:46.802 --> 02:56:50.125]  The Carlisle Group owns Booz Allen.
[02:56:50.806 --> 02:56:51.907]  Are you familiar with that, Alex?
[02:56:52.047 --> 02:56:52.287]  Yes.
[02:56:53.649 --> 02:56:57.592]  So once again, you see the Bush family entanglements.
[02:56:58.113 --> 02:56:59.794]  And I'd just like to go through a short history.
[02:56:59.854 --> 02:57:01.336]  It'll take me about a minute or two.
[02:57:01.396 --> 02:57:02.417]  I know you're short on time.
[02:57:02.457 --> 02:57:02.737]  We'll do it.
[02:57:03.858 --> 02:57:11.265]  Well, JFK gave the Secret Society speech, and Bush being in the Secret Society, next thing you know, JFK was dead.
[02:57:12.341 --> 02:57:16.645]  Then Bush shows up as an ambassador to China and he gives away everything to China.
[02:57:17.786 --> 02:57:20.269]  He was our first ambassador to China, was he not, Wayne?
[02:57:21.009 --> 02:57:21.590]  Yes, he was.
[02:57:21.650 --> 02:57:23.291]  He was the envoy, right.
[02:57:24.072 --> 02:57:28.016]  Then he shows up as CIA, head of CIA.
[02:57:29.057 --> 02:57:31.199]  Then he shows up again as vice president.
[02:57:31.784 --> 02:57:37.928]  Then he shows up as president, then he puts his son in as president, and the world's gone downhill for the last 50 years.
[02:57:38.549 --> 02:57:39.549]  Well, you know why?
[02:57:39.629 --> 02:57:44.713]  The Bushes were the last lawyers, Prescott, to control a bunch of hidden Nazi wealth.
[02:57:45.213 --> 02:57:47.655]  And that's one reason the Bushes are so important, Wayne Madsen.
[02:57:48.786 --> 02:57:50.387]  Well, yeah, I mean, the Bushes are evil.
[02:57:50.447 --> 02:57:53.188]  And, you know, what are we talking about in 2016 now?
[02:57:53.228 --> 02:57:53.888]  Hillary Clinton?
[02:57:53.908 --> 02:57:55.048]  What is this, a monarchy?
[02:57:55.088 --> 02:57:56.409]  A duopoly?
[02:57:56.489 --> 02:57:58.189]  Bush-Clinton, Bush-Clinton, Bush-Clinton?
[02:57:58.210 --> 02:58:00.190]  You know, enough of this already.
[02:58:00.230 --> 02:58:03.351]  And, you know, you throw in the Cuomo kid and all this.
[02:58:03.391 --> 02:58:04.572]  We're not that kind of country.
[02:58:05.152 --> 02:58:06.873]  We don't have royal families here.
[02:58:06.933 --> 02:58:10.234]  What's wrong with Kim Jong-un and an hereditary inbred dictatorship?
[02:58:10.614 --> 02:58:13.295]  Maybe they'll put him on teacups if it's, you know, ten generations.
[02:58:13.735 --> 02:58:15.256]  Collar, what was your final point on that?
[02:58:16.096 --> 02:58:20.518]  Alex, you have the money to bring down the Bush family, and therefore everybody else.
[02:58:20.618 --> 02:58:22.419]  Please, put your money into doing that.
[02:58:22.439 --> 02:58:22.979]  I don't have any.
[02:58:23.320 --> 02:58:25.521]  I'm spending all the money I've got on this radio show.
[02:58:25.921 --> 02:58:27.422]  I think people think I'm too powerful.
[02:58:27.862 --> 02:58:29.323]  I mean, I'll bring down the Bush family.
[02:58:29.663 --> 02:58:31.744]  I'll tell you, it's one thing to fight the whole New World Order.
[02:58:32.124 --> 02:58:38.247]  If you start going after an individual family... I mean, you heard what the Bush patron said on Larry King.
[02:58:38.287 --> 02:58:39.067]  Remember what she said?
[02:58:39.087 --> 02:58:44.510]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:58:51.249 --> 02:58:58.233]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[02:58:58.473 --> 02:59:16.083]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[02:59:16.364 --> 02:59:20.466]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[02:59:20.746 --> 02:59:22.327]  And discovered Young-Jevity.

[03:00:18.084 --> 03:00:22.187]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:23.909 --> 03:00:24.909]  Here's the article from 2003.
[03:00:24.989 --> 03:00:28.552]  We'll put it up on screen here.
[03:00:28.752 --> 03:00:31.334]  Barbara Bush threatens Democratic presidential candidates.
[03:00:32.369 --> 03:00:33.690]  It was on October 22nd, 2003.
[03:00:34.851 --> 03:00:36.252]  I've got the transcript there.
[03:00:38.053 --> 03:00:41.056]  And she said, if you mess with my family, I'll have you killed.
[03:00:41.096 --> 03:00:41.896]  You can go read it.
[03:00:41.916 --> 03:00:44.638]  I mean, the Bushes are just unbelievable.
[03:00:45.079 --> 03:00:49.962]  I know a lot of people that know George W. Bush, and they just say he is the nicest guy in the world.
[03:00:50.383 --> 03:00:52.624]  Buying you lunch, going golfing in a real night.
[03:00:53.005 --> 03:00:54.986]  He goes and cries with veterans and people.
[03:00:56.620 --> 03:00:59.802]  And I don't know what's going on with these people.
[03:01:00.222 --> 03:01:02.643]  Prescott was the top Nazi lawyer in the U.S.
[03:01:03.324 --> 03:01:06.705]  and he got to keep a lot of their wealth in Latin America when it all fell.
[03:01:06.745 --> 03:01:09.307]  That's why they're so rich and why their money's hidden.
[03:01:09.447 --> 03:01:10.307]  I mean, that's a fact.
[03:01:10.848 --> 03:01:13.309]  It's been in the London Guardian years after we broke it with Guest.
[03:01:13.989 --> 03:01:18.872]  What's your take on the Bush and the Bushes and their hidden power, Wayne Madsen?
[03:01:19.810 --> 03:01:35.099]  Well, you know, you look at the history of this, you know, this is the 50th anniversary of JFK being shot to death on the street of Dallas, and you know, there's a photograph of the school book depository of a guy that looks an awful lot like
[03:01:36.080 --> 03:01:39.023]  CIA man George H.W.
[03:01:39.063 --> 03:01:40.844]  Bush standing there in front of that building.
[03:01:40.904 --> 03:01:43.427]  I know people say, oh, it's not him, it's another guy.
[03:01:43.527 --> 03:01:45.068]  They always have these explanations.
[03:01:45.308 --> 03:01:56.759]  And look, you know, Ronald Reagan was only president for six weeks when John Hinckley broke through police lines and managed to put a slug into President Reagan.
[03:01:56.779 --> 03:01:59.322]  And he had dinner with the Bushes the night before.
[03:01:59.682 --> 03:02:06.464]  Hinckley, the Hinckley, yeah, Hinckley's son and, what was it, it was Neil Bush had dinner.
[03:02:06.564 --> 03:02:09.864]  I mean, you know, there's too many coincidences.
[03:02:10.244 --> 03:02:12.325]  You know, people say, that's a conspiracy theory.
[03:02:12.645 --> 03:02:14.946]  I say, well, I don't believe in coincidences.
[03:02:14.966 --> 03:02:16.446]  No, that's the Denver Post.
[03:02:16.526 --> 03:02:20.227]  Bush's and Hinckley's had dinner the day before Reagan shot.
[03:02:20.267 --> 03:02:20.807]  That's a fact.
[03:02:20.867 --> 03:02:21.327]  Exactly.
[03:02:21.667 --> 03:02:22.167]  Exactly.
[03:02:22.267 --> 03:02:25.389]  So, you know, the Bushes are absolutely evil.
[03:02:25.749 --> 03:02:35.334]  But, you know, as I wrote this book, The Manufacturing of a President, it's quite clear that Obama was deep-selected, probably out of accident.
[03:02:35.354 --> 03:02:36.495]  He was talent-spotted.
[03:02:37.456 --> 03:02:41.098]  And, I mean, this guy, his family was CIA.
[03:02:41.458 --> 03:02:42.058]  He was CIA.
[03:02:42.318 --> 03:02:45.280]  He worked for a CIA front company after graduating Columbia.
[03:02:45.660 --> 03:02:47.302]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[03:02:47.662 --> 03:02:50.584]  It's just a private mafia takeover masquerading as government.
[03:02:50.925 --> 03:02:52.266]  Simon in Florida, real fast.
[03:02:52.286 --> 03:02:52.947]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[03:02:52.967 --> 03:02:53.507]  Thanks for holding.
[03:02:55.549 --> 03:02:59.252]  Yeah, I just wanted to talk to you real quick about the copyright issue.
[03:02:59.693 --> 03:03:01.814]  I had the same problem myself with American Dream.
[03:03:02.375 --> 03:03:04.537]  It's a movie that you can go to through your website.
[03:03:04.697 --> 03:03:05.978]  Yeah, your phone's breaking up, brother.
[03:03:05.998 --> 03:03:06.719]  I gotta let you go.
[03:03:06.779 --> 03:03:08.821]  Devoted ally in USA.
[03:03:08.841 --> 03:03:09.441]  You're on the air.
[03:03:09.481 --> 03:03:09.862]  Go ahead.
[03:03:11.664 --> 03:03:21.029]  Yeah, Snowden's Ron Paul inspired hero, also unselfishly devoting his very life to helping protect and defend our once proud U.S.
[03:03:21.089 --> 03:03:24.910]  Constitutional Republic, and God is standing behind heroes like Snowden.
[03:03:25.551 --> 03:03:30.033]  Satan's servants, of course, include so-called President, so-called Peace Prize,
[03:03:30.811 --> 03:03:44.882]  Boehner, most prostitutes, and way too many of our brain-dead fellow so-called citizens who are lockstep dancing with the stars, while the rest of us true patriots like you and me, sir, are eagerly putting everything on the line to help save our world.
[03:03:45.002 --> 03:03:45.742]  Never give up!
[03:03:46.323 --> 03:03:49.245]  All right, thank you so much for the call.
[03:03:50.346 --> 03:03:52.508]  Real fast, Ron in New York, I'm here with Wayne Madsen.
[03:03:52.548 --> 03:03:52.828]  Go ahead.
[03:03:53.942 --> 03:04:00.945]  Yes, with regards to Ed Snowden, Ed Snowden is an American patriot and he acted in the highest way.
[03:04:01.605 --> 03:04:05.867]  The fact of the matter is all these people running around and saying he violated his oath.
[03:04:06.616 --> 03:04:08.257]  The oath is statutory law.
[03:04:08.317 --> 03:04:11.460]  Statutory law is subordinate to the constitutional law.
[03:04:11.500 --> 03:04:15.703]  This is not Europe or one of the nations of the old world that doesn't have a constitution.
[03:04:16.243 --> 03:04:30.634]  So if he felt that there was something that was going on, even if it would seem a violation of his statutory oath that was violating the higher law, which is the United States Constitution, he was correct and in fact duty-bound to bring that
[03:04:30.874 --> 03:04:31.254]  That's right.
[03:04:31.294 --> 03:04:36.795]  If they start trying to use the NDAA to kill American citizens, which they're doing, people have a right to resist that.
[03:04:36.815 --> 03:04:39.696]  I don't care if they've got some fake thing Obama signed.
[03:04:39.976 --> 03:04:42.316]  You're not allowed to kill innocent people without due process.
[03:04:42.676 --> 03:04:43.437]  God bless you, Ron.
[03:04:43.477 --> 03:04:44.117]  Good to hear from you.
[03:04:44.137 --> 03:04:44.577]  Great points.
[03:04:44.897 --> 03:04:46.617]  Wayne Madsen, thank you so much for the time.
[03:04:47.097 --> 03:04:49.338]  And I want to get you on very, very soon to track all this.
[03:04:49.378 --> 03:04:50.058]  Thank you so much.
[03:04:50.758 --> 03:04:51.338]  You bet, Alex.
[03:04:51.838 --> 03:04:52.278]  Great job.
[03:04:52.318 --> 03:04:53.639]  WayneMadsenReport.com.
[03:04:53.919 --> 03:04:55.139]  We're Infowars.com.
[03:04:55.179 --> 03:04:57.620]  Whistleblowers tonight, 7 o'clock Central.
[03:04:57.940 --> 03:04:59.100]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:04:59.220 --> 03:04:59.640]  Be there.
[03:05:01.405 --> 03:05:03.027]  Introducing Pro-1.
[03:05:03.308 --> 03:05:06.812]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[03:05:06.952 --> 03:05:11.358]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
