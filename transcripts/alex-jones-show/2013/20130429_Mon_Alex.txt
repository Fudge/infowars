[00:00:06.331 --> 00:00:10.493]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:11.153 --> 00:00:11.954]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.734 --> 00:00:13.674]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.275 --> 00:00:17.976]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.477 --> 00:00:22.519]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:28.871 --> 00:00:30.372]  It is Monday, April 29, 2013.
[00:00:31.453 --> 00:00:34.175]  I'm Jakari Jackson along with David Knight.
[00:00:34.556 --> 00:00:36.197]  This is the Alex Jones Radio Show.
[00:00:36.617 --> 00:00:41.281]  Alex Jones will be joining us at 11.40, so stay tuned for that just at the bottom of the hour.
[00:00:41.361 --> 00:00:48.207]  Also, we have guest host Gerald Cilente, and Alex will be interviewing William Jasper from The New American, so definitely look forward to that.
[00:00:48.307 --> 00:00:49.989]  David, I see you have a few articles there.
[00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:55.251]  Yeah, Jakari, we've got a lot of information breaking about the CIA's connection to the Boston bombings.
[00:00:56.231 --> 00:01:06.074]  There was one in particular, Uncle Ruslan, turns out, and this was covered on InfoWars, but actually I think the story was broken by Siebel Edmonds, I don't know.
[00:01:06.574 --> 00:01:14.162]  She covered it on Saturday, but she's actually been covering the CIA guy that's been associated with Uncle Ruslan for a long time.
[00:01:14.283 --> 00:01:15.063]  This is not news.
[00:01:15.444 --> 00:01:26.336]  He was actually on her rogue gallery that she had, American Deep State rogue gallery, and there were some gag orders put on her, but she's been writing about his connections to setting up
[00:01:26.796 --> 00:01:54.360]  Islamic false flag operations throughout Turkey and Chechnya and the the the chaos stan area essentially for a quite a long time We're gonna be having an interview with C Bell on the nightly news tonight So I want everybody to tune into that because it's gonna connect a lot of dots a lot of things that are not being reported by the mainstream media But that all really kind of tie into this bombing and like I said this Graham Fuller the CIA guy that has connections to Uncle Ruslan is right at the center of all of that and
[00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:55.080]  Exactly.
[00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.222]  So be sure to turn into the InfoWars Nightly News 7 p.m.
[00:01:58.262 --> 00:01:58.602]  Central.
[00:01:58.622 --> 00:01:59.702]  David Knight will be hosting.
[00:01:59.722 --> 00:02:02.204]  I just want to go over a few articles in this short segment.
[00:02:03.004 --> 00:02:05.865]  This is available on InfoWars.com from Washington's blog.
[00:02:06.205 --> 00:02:06.926]  Multiple polls.
[00:02:07.106 --> 00:02:09.387]  Americans are more afraid of the government.
[00:02:10.007 --> 00:02:17.032]  Now, since 9-11, we've seen people give up all kinds of liberties and the promise, and I just say the promise, of security.
[00:02:17.453 --> 00:02:18.634]  We have this article right here.
[00:02:18.654 --> 00:02:30.943]  It says, according to a pair of recent polls, for the first time since 9-11, the 9-11 terrorist hijackings, Americans are more fearful of their government than the abuses of terrorists.
[00:02:30.983 --> 00:02:33.425]  And you can see they want their constitutional liberties as well.
[00:02:34.085 --> 00:02:39.787]  The poll suggests Americans are hesitant to give up any further freedoms in exchange for increased, quote, security.
[00:02:39.807 --> 00:02:41.308]  And I like how the article says it right there.
[00:02:41.328 --> 00:02:44.189]  That's all it is, is the promise of security.
[00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:44.629]  That's right.
[00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:46.630]  So, David... You know, I think it's interesting.
[00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:57.514]  If you look at this article a little bit further down, what it says is that right after 9-11, it shot up to 71% people saying that they would give up their freedom for security, their promise of security.
[00:02:57.994 --> 00:03:01.716]  And then it kind of held there for a couple of years, and then it started dropping.
[00:03:02.316 --> 00:03:04.698]  And what's interesting about this poll is the timing.
[00:03:05.078 --> 00:03:06.720]  This is one day after the bombing.
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:16.627]  And it was pretty close, but there were, you know, it was like 45 to 43 percent, you know, that were... 45 percent said, no, we don't want to give up any liberties for this.
[00:03:17.028 --> 00:03:18.108]  So that was kind of interesting.
[00:03:18.148 --> 00:03:20.730]  The other thing I find interesting is the way that poll broke down.
[00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:26.014]  Democrats overwhelmingly still are behind the idea that government can make them safe, okay?
[00:03:26.034 --> 00:03:26.695]  51% to 36%.
[00:03:27.675 --> 00:03:31.158]  Republicans were essentially equally divided.
[00:03:31.718 --> 00:03:33.880]  Independents, of course, where our hope lies.
[00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.380]  Yes.
[00:03:34.741 --> 00:03:39.924]  Because the independents, it was only 29% willing to sacrifice their freedom for the promise of security.
[00:03:39.944 --> 00:03:40.705]  58% said no.
[00:03:42.898 --> 00:03:43.839]  And that's what we keep seeing.
[00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:45.440]  People are waking up.
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.801]  It's the paradigm shift.
[00:03:46.821 --> 00:03:50.263]  People are getting new information, new sources of information.
[00:03:50.303 --> 00:03:53.205]  They're turning away from the mainstream and going to alternative sources.
[00:03:53.486 --> 00:03:55.267]  And even InfoWars don't believe what we say.
[00:03:55.327 --> 00:03:56.548]  Go and check things for yourself.
[00:03:56.988 --> 00:04:02.032]  And speaking of people who took things into their own hands, I want to do this quick article, Dave, and we can come back with your thoughts.
[00:04:02.772 --> 00:04:05.614]  30 arrested in New York during rally against drones.
[00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:13.739]  Now this is at the Hancock Air Force National Base and it says a group of people lying on the base's driveway were arrested.
[00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.963]  Charges include disorderly conduct, obstructing a government administration and loitering.
[00:04:20.174 --> 00:04:33.582]  So, it just makes me laugh that, you know, the simple act of lying on the ground noncombatively is now viewed as obstructing justice, or disorderly conduct, I should say, obstructing the government administration.
[00:04:33.802 --> 00:04:36.063]  Look at what Bloomberg does in New York.
[00:04:36.083 --> 00:04:39.705]  I mean, I remember stories about people who couldn't smoke.
[00:04:40.025 --> 00:04:45.708]  Guys who had a barbershop, they couldn't smoke in their shop, so they stood out in front of it, smoked a cigarette, then they got a ticket for loitering for a couple hundred dollars.
[00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.135]  Okay, well this is the end of the first segment.
[00:04:49.156 --> 00:04:50.961]  We'll be back right after this break with more news.
[00:05:01.661 --> 00:05:04.403]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[00:05:04.683 --> 00:05:09.506]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[00:05:09.706 --> 00:05:16.871]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[00:05:17.011 --> 00:05:22.413]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[00:05:22.653 --> 00:05:26.374]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[00:05:26.674 --> 00:05:31.176]  You've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[00:05:31.396 --> 00:05:36.598]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[00:05:36.858 --> 00:05:39.941]  Strategic Relocation 3rd Edition by Joel Skousen.
[00:05:40.081 --> 00:05:42.343]  When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.
[00:05:42.603 --> 00:05:47.187]  Ferrosafe used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:49.809]  Hand crank shortwave AM FM radios.

[00:06:05.341 --> 00:06:10.803]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[00:06:11.383 --> 00:06:14.585]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?

[00:07:06.856 --> 00:07:11.260]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:17.385]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:07:17.505 --> 00:07:28.293]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.
[00:07:28.493 --> 00:07:34.780]  It is the only one that does it, and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.

[00:07:49.875 --> 00:07:54.756]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:20.433 --> 00:08:22.654]  Alright, welcome back to the Alex Jones Radio Show.
[00:08:22.674 --> 00:08:24.696]  Jakari Jackson and David Knight sitting in.
[00:08:24.956 --> 00:08:27.978]  Alex will be joining us at 1140, so stay tuned for that.
[00:08:28.398 --> 00:08:31.099]  If you're watching on PrisonPlanet.tv, you see the article right there.
[00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:34.562]  Bilderberg sleuth Jim Tucker dead at age 78.
[00:08:35.142 --> 00:08:37.343]  So our condolences go out to Jim and his family.
[00:08:37.443 --> 00:08:39.404]  Alex talked about it yesterday on the Sunday Show.
[00:08:39.825 --> 00:08:42.887]  I'm sure we'll have more information coming up a little bit later on.
[00:08:43.347 --> 00:08:44.388]  So I'll throw back to David.
[00:08:44.428 --> 00:08:46.249]  David, you had more points you wanted to make on our
[00:08:47.009 --> 00:08:47.650]  Our last topic.
[00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:53.595]  Yeah, you know, we were talking about people waking up and realizing that government was actually a bigger threat to them than terrorism.
[00:08:53.816 --> 00:08:56.238]  And the actuality of it is very true.
[00:08:56.318 --> 00:09:04.085]  When you go down and you look at the actual actuary and figures and see the likely cases of how people are going to die, it's a little known fact.
[00:09:04.646 --> 00:09:10.451]  But according to the US Department of State, only 17 US citizens were killed worldwide
[00:09:11.272 --> 00:09:15.754]  As a result of terrorism in 2011, that's the year that we have, most recent year we have statistics for.
[00:09:16.354 --> 00:09:21.637]  That includes deaths in Afghanistan, in Iraq, and everywhere where we're at war.
[00:09:21.817 --> 00:09:23.517]  Only 17 people.
[00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:28.720]  And people will use that as the talking point, well that just shows TSA works.
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:38.484]  Well TSA isn't really catching anybody because even in situations like the underwear bomber, TSA didn't stop that guy, it was the passengers on the plane that jumped to action, not the TSA.
[00:09:38.644 --> 00:09:38.984]  That's right.
[00:09:39.364 --> 00:09:44.128]  And as Alex has pointed out over and over again, you know, things like drowning is way up there.
[00:09:44.168 --> 00:09:47.591]  I mean, you have people that drown that's like 18,000 people, okay?
[00:09:47.611 --> 00:09:51.394]  A thousand times more likely to drown than you are to get, you know, hit by a terrorist attack.
[00:09:51.434 --> 00:09:56.178]  But of course, we all know it's things, diseases like heart disease, cancer, that sort of thing.
[00:09:56.218 --> 00:09:57.479]  That's really what you need to worry about.
[00:09:57.499 --> 00:09:58.160]  Car accidents.
[00:09:58.300 --> 00:09:58.780]  Exactly.
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:03.124]  But it is, you know, when it's the absurdity, just like we saw in Boston.
[00:10:03.644 --> 00:10:09.087]  One teenager with no military training or experience, and we find out he had no gun on him.
[00:10:09.247 --> 00:10:13.109]  And yet, look at what they did in terms of martial law in Boston.
[00:10:13.549 --> 00:10:15.290]  That was to establish a pattern.
[00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:18.452]  That was to establish a pattern of the way the police can operate.
[00:10:18.492 --> 00:10:22.334]  And we're already seeing them repeat that pattern in various other cities.
[00:10:22.354 --> 00:10:25.095]  There were two other places where they did it just this last week.
[00:10:25.495 --> 00:10:28.317]  They're setting a pattern just like they did with SWAT teams.
[00:10:28.677 --> 00:10:30.598]  That came in with a police chief in L.A.
[00:10:31.338 --> 00:10:31.579]  I don't
[00:10:46.155 --> 00:10:46.515]  I think so.
[00:11:14.259 --> 00:11:16.441]  Exactly, because people don't want to get active.
[00:11:16.461 --> 00:11:20.985]  They think, well, I mean, people have the idea that you can work at the national level and you can.
[00:11:21.005 --> 00:11:26.489]  I do encourage you to contact your national representatives and such, but you have to get at the local level.
[00:11:26.509 --> 00:11:30.272]  You have to go talk to your sheriff and your police chief and your city councilman and your mayor.
[00:11:30.693 --> 00:11:33.235]  And if you're like us here in Austin, maybe they might not be the
[00:11:33.675 --> 00:11:34.656]  Best representatives.
[00:11:34.996 --> 00:11:38.078]  But, I mean, if you can, vote him out.
[00:11:38.198 --> 00:11:44.441]  Get some people in there who will do the will of the people, not the will of the feds or, you know, Joe Biden or whoever else.
[00:11:45.042 --> 00:11:49.804]  So, and speaking of Joe Biden, this dovetails over to the President Obama report.
[00:11:49.904 --> 00:11:54.407]  Obama spent twice as much time on vacation in golf as the economy.
[00:11:54.447 --> 00:12:00.951]  Now, this is out of Breitbart, and you can see that he spent more time on the golf course than he did in any type of economic meeting.
[00:12:01.752 --> 00:12:03.853]  You know, I might say that might be a good thing, Chikari.
[00:12:05.334 --> 00:12:06.734]  Maybe it was a good thing.
[00:12:06.754 --> 00:12:09.056]  Maybe it's a good thing we don't get all the government that we pay for.
[00:12:09.656 --> 00:12:15.339]  You know, I would hate to think if he was enacting a rigorous economic plan on us, what that would look like.
[00:12:15.399 --> 00:12:17.840]  So let's encourage him to go golfing more.
[00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:23.724]  Well, my deal is, you know, he spends all this tax money to go play golf with Tiger Woods and, you know, whoever else.
[00:12:23.785 --> 00:12:30.910]  And I don't know what all he has going, but then he sends his daughters on these million dollar spring break vacations to Mexico and so forth.
[00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:36.154]  And, you know, you got the Secret Service and, you know, guys hiding in trees trying to make sure nobody's trying to talk to him and all this stuff.
[00:12:36.194 --> 00:12:37.415]  It's just, it's over the top.
[00:12:37.435 --> 00:12:38.116]  It's a waste of money.
[00:12:38.156 --> 00:12:41.959]  Meanwhile, you can't take a tour of the White House because of sequestration.
[00:12:42.199 --> 00:12:43.941]  Yeah, well, they're royalty, you know.
[00:12:44.501 --> 00:12:45.662]  They're our American royalty.
[00:12:45.783 --> 00:12:48.966]  And they live a lifestyle, the rich and famous, and then some.
[00:12:49.046 --> 00:12:50.107]  It's just pretty amazing.
[00:12:51.107 --> 00:12:54.408]  You know, talking about money, this is an article that's on InfoWars.
[00:12:54.749 --> 00:12:59.131]  The more illegal immigrants that go on food stamps, the more money JP Morgan makes.
[00:12:59.491 --> 00:13:00.051]  How about that?
[00:13:00.231 --> 00:13:08.495]  It turns out they've made over a half a billion dollars just on processing fees for people who are getting food stamps and that sort of thing.
[00:13:08.555 --> 00:13:13.777]  So they get anywhere from 31 cents to $2.30 for every single person on food stamps.
[00:13:14.377 --> 00:13:17.739]  So they're making hundreds of millions of dollars off of this.
[00:13:18.579 --> 00:13:24.384]  And when you see this kind of thing happening, it's no wonder that, you know, we have a welfare state.
[00:13:24.665 --> 00:13:34.153]  It's just like the welfare state, just like the military-industrial complex, is being run largely for the benefit of the big corporations and banks at the very top.
[00:13:34.353 --> 00:13:34.754]  Right.
[00:13:34.814 --> 00:13:38.617]  Just like you see a half a billion dollar tank that the Army doesn't want.
[00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:41.060]  You see fighter jets that the Air Force doesn't want.
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:44.202]  You see a vertical takeoff and landing plane that the Marines don't want.
[00:13:44.302 --> 00:13:44.623]  And yet,
[00:13:45.083 --> 00:13:50.825]  You've got congressmen from both political parties pushing for these things that the military doesn't want.
[00:13:51.005 --> 00:13:51.266]  Why?
[00:13:51.766 --> 00:13:57.368]  Because it makes money for the people who really run in this, that's the military-industrial complex.
[00:13:57.428 --> 00:13:59.509]  You know, the army doesn't want the tank.
[00:13:59.789 --> 00:14:01.870]  The army doesn't want the war, most of them, right?
[00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:03.951]  Because they're going to be the ones who are going to be fighting and dying in it.
[00:14:04.351 --> 00:14:09.533]  But the wars and the tanks are what make the money for the military-industrial complex that Eisenhower warned us about.
[00:14:10.293 --> 00:14:15.337]  You know, they can't see the connection that these people make huge sums of money off of war.
[00:14:15.377 --> 00:14:16.998]  They don't make money in peacetime.
[00:14:17.338 --> 00:14:29.007]  You know, they have tanks and guns and bullets and other things that they profit off of, and people just can't wrap their head around the concept that maybe we're starting wars unnecessarily to push that type of agenda.
[00:14:29.047 --> 00:14:29.627]  Well, think about it.
[00:14:29.727 --> 00:14:31.249]  It's a durable good, right?
[00:14:31.429 --> 00:14:36.693]  One of the problems that they have in the automobile industry is that they started making cars that were much more durable.
[00:14:36.713 --> 00:14:39.715]  They wouldn't wear out in just a couple of years, so they're not able to sell them.
[00:14:39.855 --> 00:14:40.355]  I don't think so.
[00:15:07.202 --> 00:15:10.546]  That's what the military industrial complex is doing when they manipulate foreign policy.
[00:15:10.846 --> 00:15:16.211]  And in the same way, we see the welfare state being manipulated for the benefit of bankers and big corporations.
[00:15:16.952 --> 00:15:24.019]  In this situation where JP Morgan is making a half a billion dollars, they have a flyer that they give to
[00:15:25.268 --> 00:15:37.130]  Department of Agriculture gives out to people on food stamps and in boldface underlined, it says in Spanish, you need not divulge information regarding your immigration status and seeking this benefit for your children.
[00:15:37.971 --> 00:15:39.831]  And we talked about that a little bit yesterday.
[00:15:39.851 --> 00:15:40.211]  Yeah.
[00:15:40.351 --> 00:15:47.092]  And I gave the example, you know, I'm definitely against biometrics, but in the state of Texas, you have to get your fingerprints taken to get a Texas driver's license.
[00:15:47.132 --> 00:15:48.633]  I don't like it, but that's what I had to do.
[00:15:49.013 --> 00:15:53.494]  But we saw we see in other states where they're telling immigrants, you don't have to give your fingerprints or whatever else.
[00:15:53.514 --> 00:15:54.714]  Just come get your driver's license.
[00:15:55.414 --> 00:15:58.037]  It's a similar thing with the entitlement programs.
[00:15:58.197 --> 00:15:58.597]  Exactly.
[00:15:58.857 --> 00:16:06.144]  You cannot have open borders and an open-ended welfare system, right?
[00:16:06.844 --> 00:16:14.091]  I remember years and years ago they used to have this thing called the Nolan Chart that they would do in the Libertarian Party, see where people were trying to get them out of this left-right paradigm.
[00:16:14.111 --> 00:16:19.876]  So it basically changes this straight line into a two-dimensional space.
[00:16:20.476 --> 00:16:26.078]  And they would have like 10 questions on personal liberty, 10 questions on economic freedom and that sort of thing.
[00:16:26.238 --> 00:16:28.559]  And one of the questions would be about open borders.
[00:16:28.679 --> 00:16:35.641]  And my position on it was you cannot have open borders, I mean you cannot have open immigration unless you first end the welfare state.
[00:16:36.321 --> 00:16:37.902]  And it will bankrupt you.
[00:16:38.002 --> 00:16:41.405]  And that's basically what we have now though, is that we have fully open borders.
[00:16:41.525 --> 00:16:49.210]  They've essentially opened the borders, but they are piping up the welfare state to a new dimension.
[00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:58.216]  And what that means is that it's just making people who are working legally in this country, it's burdening them, and it's also keeping people who really do need some help
[00:16:58.776 --> 00:17:03.739]  From being able to get it because of the massive amount of money that's being wasted and misdirected.
[00:17:04.139 --> 00:17:04.379]  Oh, yeah.
[00:17:04.419 --> 00:17:08.922]  It's a huge, huge amount misdirected and going to people who don't really need it.
[00:17:09.542 --> 00:17:11.083]  People can't get the assistance that they need.
[00:17:11.123 --> 00:17:14.345]  And, you know, it's like we say, we talk about entitlement programs.
[00:17:14.365 --> 00:17:22.689]  You know, if you need something temporarily, that's one thing, but you're not supposed to be on it to the point where you become dependent, lifelong, lifelong recipient of this thing.
[00:17:22.709 --> 00:17:26.491]  And it's definitely hurting people because they don't want to get out or they don't know how to work.
[00:17:26.612 --> 00:17:27.232]  Maybe I should say.
[00:17:27.512 --> 00:17:27.612]  Yeah.
[00:17:48.712 --> 00:17:49.353]  We're good.
[00:18:09.315 --> 00:18:11.676]  They want you dependent on them economically.
[00:18:11.696 --> 00:18:12.176]  Right.
[00:18:12.256 --> 00:18:20.240]  And so in both cases, politicians push this agenda because it empowers them and it takes power away from the people.
[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:21.000]  Exactly.
[00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:24.482]  Now I want to move to international news and our news blitz here.
[00:18:24.502 --> 00:18:25.502]  I have this article right here.
[00:18:25.963 --> 00:18:28.584]  Powerful blast injures up to 40 in Prague.
[00:18:28.984 --> 00:18:33.446]  A powerful explosion badly damaged an office building in the center of the Czech capital Monday
[00:18:34.046 --> 00:18:35.467]  Injuring up to 40 people.
[00:18:35.707 --> 00:18:38.930]  Authorities believe people still may be buried in the rubble.
[00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:42.533]  So definitely our thoughts and prayers go out to the people in that location.
[00:18:42.693 --> 00:18:55.302]  That's something that is amazing because C. Bell Edmonds was talking about how Americans knew so little about Chechnya that they were thinking that the Chechen area was actually Czechoslovakia.
[00:18:55.622 --> 00:18:55.943]  Oh yeah.
[00:18:56.063 --> 00:18:58.845]  And now we have a terrorist event in Prague, Czechoslovakia.
[00:18:58.885 --> 00:19:02.608]  So that's going to even make the American public more confused, I guess.
[00:19:03.388 --> 00:19:04.909]  Exactly.
[00:19:04.929 --> 00:19:05.309]  Get a map.
[00:19:05.769 --> 00:19:06.950]  So let's take a look at some more.
[00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:11.832]  Israel points finger at Iran over drone from Lebanon.
[00:19:12.132 --> 00:19:18.635]  And this is what we've been hearing that various drones are going to start popping up in various parts of the Middle East, or more drones I should say.
[00:19:19.435 --> 00:19:20.236]  And we'll see.
[00:19:20.336 --> 00:19:27.739]  Israel believes that Iran's Revolutionary Guard was responsible for the unmanned drone launch from Lebanon that was shot down in Israel's
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:30.680]  Airspace on Thursday.
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:32.121]  So you can see the helicopter right there.
[00:19:32.161 --> 00:19:33.181]  This doesn't show a drone.
[00:19:33.201 --> 00:19:36.142]  That's a helicopter, but it's something that's going on out there.
[00:19:36.162 --> 00:19:38.343]  And you know, drones aren't just international.
[00:19:38.383 --> 00:19:38.983]  They're coming home.
[00:19:39.003 --> 00:19:39.824]  They already are home.
[00:19:39.864 --> 00:19:42.765]  They're on the U.S.-Mexico border, U.S.-Canada border.
[00:19:42.805 --> 00:19:43.565]  They're flying around.
[00:19:43.585 --> 00:19:47.466]  People say, why don't you use them to shoot Chris Dorner and shoot the guys in Boston?
[00:19:47.486 --> 00:19:49.287]  But we'll have more on this on the other side.
[00:20:02.139 --> 00:20:05.002]  Is this the year you finally get serious about your family's drinking water?
[00:20:05.342 --> 00:20:08.625]  If so, keep listening for a special offer from Big Berkey Water Filters.
[00:20:08.705 --> 00:20:11.547]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water is fluoridated?
[00:20:11.688 --> 00:20:22.517]  Berkey Water Filters distinguish themselves from many other filtration systems with the capability to significantly reduce dangerous chlorine, fluoride, arsenic, and disinfection byproducts from municipal water via the Black Berkey and PF line of filters.
[00:20:22.617 --> 00:20:23.658]  Then there's affordability.
[00:20:23.758 --> 00:20:24.759]  At only 1.7 cents per gallon,
[00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:26.340]  We're good to go.
[00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:58.231]  It's free shipping on every order over 50 dollars.
[00:20:58.351 --> 00:21:00.882]  Big Berkey water filters for the love of clean water.
[00:21:03.092 --> 00:21:05.933]  Ceramic Body Armor is rated to stop six hits.
[00:21:06.213 --> 00:21:07.373]  But what about the seventh?
[00:21:07.593 --> 00:21:11.635]  Unlike Ceramic or Kevlar, Infidel Body Armor is proven to take hit after hit.
[00:21:11.855 --> 00:21:13.175]  And it just won't quit.
[00:21:13.415 --> 00:21:19.897]  Reasonably priced and designed for the smart civilian prepper, Infidel stops hundreds of hits from small arms to high-powered rifles.
[00:21:20.117 --> 00:21:22.078]  That means safety and peace of mind.
[00:21:22.258 --> 00:21:24.639]  Buy yours at InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[00:21:24.679 --> 00:21:28.560]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:30.981]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:21:31.141 --> 00:21:40.427]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:21:40.487 --> 00:21:41.208]  This capitalism?
[00:21:41.268 --> 00:21:47.412]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:21:47.552 --> 00:21:48.312]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:21:48.353 --> 00:21:51.435]  I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[00:21:51.495 --> 00:21:52.435]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.

[00:22:01.521 --> 00:22:03.442]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[00:22:03.462 --> 00:22:06.024]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[00:22:06.284 --> 00:22:11.086]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[00:22:11.286 --> 00:22:15.048]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[00:22:15.308 --> 00:22:19.050]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:20.391]  The fact is, you are.
[00:22:20.591 --> 00:22:21.372]  We all are.
[00:22:21.612 --> 00:22:23.933]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[00:22:24.233 --> 00:22:32.518]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoods Direct.

[00:22:50.689 --> 00:22:52.510]  The coming financial collapse is real.
[00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:54.251]  The subsequent social unrest will happen.

[00:24:14.293 --> 00:24:27.240]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:33.363]  I'm David Knight and I'm here with Ja'Kari Jackson and we're filling in for the first part of the show and Alex is going to be joining us in a little bit.
[00:24:33.423 --> 00:24:40.687]  He's going to have an interview with William Jasper from the New American and the last hour of the show we're going to have Gerald Salente so don't miss that.
[00:24:41.653 --> 00:24:47.858]  Now, we were talking and we mentioned it just briefly before in the first segment about Jim Tucker passing away.
[00:24:48.598 --> 00:24:54.643]  Jim Tucker, of course, was a person who was on the trail of Bilderberg for decades, pretty much single-handedly.
[00:24:54.683 --> 00:24:56.765]  And you know, Jakari, when I think about Jim Tucker,
[00:24:57.691 --> 00:25:12.968]  And his struggle for decades in obscurity, what it reminds me of is William Wilberforce, a guy who, if you go back and look at history and look at, it was chronicled in the movie Amazing Grace, he had some connections to the fellow who wrote that song.
[00:25:13.688 --> 00:25:19.134]  But William Wilberforce was somebody who, for decades in Parliament, tried to educate people about slavery.
[00:25:20.146 --> 00:25:24.389]  And he was pretty much by himself, and he was up against huge economic interests of the day.
[00:25:24.969 --> 00:25:28.192]  But he had to wake people up to the moral issues of slavery.
[00:25:28.732 --> 00:25:30.713]  And he was successful just before he died.
[00:25:31.314 --> 00:25:34.336]  And you know, in a way, Jim Tucker did the same thing.
[00:25:34.416 --> 00:25:38.739]  Not only was he laboring in obscurity, but he was also trying to wake people up to slavery.
[00:25:38.919 --> 00:25:39.079]  Right.
[00:25:39.239 --> 00:25:41.841]  But it was waking us up to our own slavery.
[00:25:42.509 --> 00:25:42.849]  We're good
[00:25:58.098 --> 00:25:59.039]  It's the normalcy bias.
[00:26:19.716 --> 00:26:21.937]  And they weren't doing this for benign reasons.
[00:26:21.977 --> 00:26:24.437]  They weren't doing this to make the area more efficient.
[00:26:24.577 --> 00:26:27.398]  They were doing it to destroy it so they could take control of it.
[00:26:27.458 --> 00:26:29.058]  And we see those plans coming out now.
[00:26:29.118 --> 00:26:31.259]  And for decades, he was the only one talking about that.
[00:26:31.839 --> 00:26:35.080]  Well, he passed away just a few days ago.
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:39.381]  And Alex did a tribute to him because Alex knows him very well.
[00:26:39.941 --> 00:26:41.941]  And let's cut to that tribute right now.
[00:26:43.782 --> 00:26:47.143]  Well, it's Sunday morning here at the end of April 2013.
[00:26:50.182 --> 00:26:54.383]  And I just got the word that my old friend, Jim Tucker, passed away.
[00:26:56.404 --> 00:27:14.050]  One of the last of the old gumshoe straw hat journalist who was a sports writer until the seventies when he discovered writings by a man named Pegler for other newspapers who had exposed a private secret of Cabal that had been meeting at Jekyll Island, Georgia.
[00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:18.011]  The same place they'd met in 1913 to establish the private fellow reserve.
[00:27:20.083 --> 00:27:33.631]  And Jim, over the next 30 plus years, fought an uphill battle to expose the Bilderberg Group, with the media saying it didn't exist, just like J. Edgar Hoover tried to say that La Cosa Nostra didn't exist, organized crime, in the 50s.
[00:27:34.131 --> 00:27:35.412]  We all now laugh at that.
[00:27:36.093 --> 00:27:42.636]  But if it wasn't for trailblazers like Jim Tucker, we wouldn't know about the real top of the pyramid global mafia, the Bilderberg Group.
[00:27:43.697 --> 00:27:46.979]  They've now released documents in Italy in their Supreme Court where the Bilderberg Group
[00:27:47.813 --> 00:27:52.515]  Has been caught being involved in staged terror attacks and other organized crime activities.
[00:27:53.635 --> 00:28:00.558]  Documents have been leaked by WikiLeaks with Henry Kissinger saying, we do illegal immediately, unconstitutional is harder.
[00:28:02.019 --> 00:28:07.141]  And thanks to Jim being ridiculed and attacked, but knowing he was right, he forced this out in the open.
[00:28:07.501 --> 00:28:11.363]  It's what one man can do in the beginning.
[00:28:11.803 --> 00:28:13.263]  And then others began to join him.
[00:28:13.904 --> 00:28:14.584]  And over time,
[00:28:15.757 --> 00:28:24.042]  Over time we were able to expose this cabal, and now Rolling Stone Magazine yesterday came out and said, we owe the conspiracy theorists an apology.
[00:28:24.422 --> 00:28:29.525]  There is a private corporate secret cabal, one world government, LIBOR and beyond.
[00:28:30.406 --> 00:28:33.287]  The entire world economy is manipulated for insiders.
[00:28:34.008 --> 00:28:35.108]  It is fascism.
[00:28:35.169 --> 00:28:37.850]  It is crony capitalism, the opposite of liberty.
[00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:42.513]  And we owe people like Jim Tucker a real debt of gratitude.
[00:28:44.517 --> 00:28:46.699]  And that's why I'm here in the Ozark Mountains.
[00:28:47.359 --> 00:28:49.761]  And I wanted to share the beauty of these woods with you out there.
[00:28:49.801 --> 00:28:53.243]  As we remember, Jim Tucker, demonized by the media.
[00:28:53.964 --> 00:28:56.966]  They said he was insane, he was a liar, but no, he was proven right.
[00:28:57.406 --> 00:29:02.210]  And now Bilderberg is mainstream news, and now the globalists can't operate in the dark.
[00:29:02.290 --> 00:29:04.271]  See, first they want to deny they exist.
[00:29:04.831 --> 00:29:10.255]  Because once you have a debate with them, they will lose the debate because of the politics they're involved in.
[00:29:10.295 --> 00:29:10.856]  They're tyrants.
[00:29:11.296 --> 00:29:14.018]  So they wanted to just hide and make the world think
[00:29:14.477 --> 00:29:15.978]  That they didn't exist.
[00:29:17.499 --> 00:29:19.040]  But they can't do that anymore.
[00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:20.701]  Thanks to people like Jim Tucker.
[00:29:21.642 --> 00:29:23.904]  And we continue to walk in his footsteps now.
[00:29:24.864 --> 00:29:26.806]  We continue to stand with Jim.
[00:29:28.066 --> 00:29:32.349]  And continue his work and others work exposing the New World Order.
[00:29:32.389 --> 00:29:34.231]  Because men and women come and go.
[00:29:34.251 --> 00:29:36.252]  We're born to the world, we grow up, we die.
[00:29:36.853 --> 00:29:38.474]  But what matters is our body of work.
[00:29:39.214 --> 00:29:42.937]  And Jim Tucker's body of work will live on forever.
[00:29:43.874 --> 00:29:50.259]  And so this is basically my short eulogy to Jim Tucker, who was a great guy, a funny guy.
[00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:51.881]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.381 --> 00:29:53.983]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.903 --> 00:29:57.566]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:05.805 --> 00:30:06.726]  Tyranny is here.
[00:30:07.066 --> 00:30:10.628]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:30:10.929 --> 00:30:13.210]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:18.674]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:30:19.094 --> 00:30:25.379]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:30:25.759 --> 00:30:31.323]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:30:31.743 --> 00:30:35.426]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:30:35.906 --> 00:30:39.910]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:46.136]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:30:46.156 --> 00:30:49.139]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:51.121]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:30:51.682 --> 00:30:52.202]  It's here.

[00:31:01.468 --> 00:31:03.389]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[00:31:03.409 --> 00:31:05.670]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[00:31:05.831 --> 00:31:11.114]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[00:31:11.294 --> 00:31:15.076]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[00:31:15.356 --> 00:31:19.118]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[00:31:19.278 --> 00:31:20.479]  The fact is, you are.
[00:31:20.679 --> 00:31:21.439]  We all are.
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:24.021]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[00:31:24.321 --> 00:31:32.688]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoodsDirect.
[00:31:32.888 --> 00:31:34.089]  Be prepared before you need it.
[00:31:34.269 --> 00:31:37.452]  With nutrient-dense food you can store for up to 25 years.
[00:31:37.732 --> 00:31:39.994]  You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed you.

[00:32:08.812 --> 00:32:14.715]  At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of silver-based products.

[00:32:26.521 --> 00:32:29.822]  Just released is our 100% natural silver gel.
[00:32:30.663 --> 00:32:36.846]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.
[00:32:37.586 --> 00:32:48.011]  But rather we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the silver more effectively.

[00:33:03.541 --> 00:33:09.032]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:33:09.513 --> 00:33:12.058]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:17.512 --> 00:33:19.472]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Radio Show.
[00:33:19.492 --> 00:33:21.373]  Jakari Jackson and David Knight filling in.
[00:33:21.473 --> 00:33:25.334]  Alex will be joining us this segment in just a few minutes, so stay tuned for that.
[00:33:25.594 --> 00:33:30.275]  We just saw the video, the eulogy, I guess you could say, of Jim Tucker by Alex Jones.
[00:33:30.675 --> 00:33:33.516]  And speaking of Bilderberg News, David Knight, you have some more information on that?
[00:33:34.256 --> 00:33:39.277]  Yes, actually it's an article from the New American, and we're going to be talking to William Jasper.
[00:33:40.377 --> 00:33:41.918]  Actually, Alex is going to be interviewing him.
[00:33:41.958 --> 00:33:46.659]  And this is an article that he wrote about a week ago, and it really ties in what we're talking about here.
[00:33:47.782 --> 00:33:56.067]  The Council on Foreign Relations had a meeting, and listen to this, they actually have a guy who is a director of a global governance program there, okay?
[00:33:56.327 --> 00:34:01.130]  And they had a conference that John Kerry went to, and this was covered in the article by William Jasper.
[00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:08.774]  And the title of the panel discussion was the G20 Prospects and Challenges for Global Governance.
[00:34:09.554 --> 00:34:15.878]  And you know, global governance, when you look at this, the perfect beard for it is climate change, because that's a so-called global problem.
[00:34:16.138 --> 00:34:16.718]  Right.
[00:34:17.038 --> 00:34:26.521]  But it's also, they can also use a manufactured liquidity crisis, just like the Federal Reserve was created after the manufactured liquidity crisis of the 1907 crash.
[00:34:26.921 --> 00:34:31.923]  And we're coming up to the 100th anniversary of the Federal Reserve, so we need to take a look at the roots of that.
[00:34:31.963 --> 00:34:34.364]  But now we see the same sort of thing happening in Europe.
[00:34:34.424 --> 00:34:36.904]  And listen to this quote from this conference.
[00:34:36.944 --> 00:34:40.905]  This is from Ian Brimmer, who's president of the Eurasia Group.
[00:34:41.226 --> 00:34:42.626]  And they actually have this on video.
[00:34:42.686 --> 00:34:45.607]  He says, the EU is much more significant
[00:34:46.107 --> 00:34:51.030]  There is a real subversion of sovereignty by the EU that works.
[00:34:51.571 --> 00:34:54.232]  There's a real subversion of sovereignty.
[00:34:54.292 --> 00:34:54.893]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:34:55.113 --> 00:34:56.013]  Keep that phrase.
[00:34:56.053 --> 00:34:57.574]  Repeat that to yourself over and over again.
[00:34:58.035 --> 00:35:01.777]  That's a good thing from the standpoint of the Council on Foreign Relationship.
[00:35:02.157 --> 00:35:05.139]  And it's also a good thing from the perspective of the Bilderberg people.
[00:35:05.479 --> 00:35:05.659]  Right?
[00:35:05.699 --> 00:35:13.942]  They're looking to, they're open about their intentions to subvert national sovereignty and to create a global government.
[00:35:14.222 --> 00:35:17.584]  Now you can talk about the difference between global government and global governance.
[00:35:18.644 --> 00:35:20.805]  I would argue that that's a distinction without a difference.
[00:35:21.765 --> 00:35:26.027]  But we need to be aware of the fact that they have historically done this.
[00:35:26.067 --> 00:35:31.149]  You know, climate change is something that they've used to justify this, but it's also
[00:35:32.436 --> 00:35:35.958]  Uh, global governance, but it's also been their M.O.
[00:35:36.018 --> 00:35:41.220]  to use liquidity crises, and that's what we see happening now in Europe with a vengeance.
[00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:47.663]  And climate change is one of those big deals, because I believe Obama talked about it in his inauguration recently.
[00:35:49.044 --> 00:35:54.806]  Climate change being one of the driving forces behind his new campaign, besides, you know, taking your guns and other civil liberties.
[00:35:55.526 --> 00:35:59.768]  And we see guys, Al Gore, many other people saying that, you know, polar bears can't swim.
[00:35:59.828 --> 00:36:00.469]  Alex is, you know,
[00:36:01.189 --> 00:36:03.711]  He's famously shown you those clips and so on.
[00:36:03.751 --> 00:36:04.872]  But that's the thing that they're going to push.
[00:36:04.892 --> 00:36:09.435]  Because remember, it was global cooling, then it was global warming, and then it was global cooling.
[00:36:09.475 --> 00:36:13.838]  And now if somebody spits on the sidewalk, that's climate change and you have to give all your money to Al Gore.
[00:36:13.998 --> 00:36:19.302]  And my question to people when I meet, when I meet people, I got to talk to somebody at South by Southwest when we went out there.
[00:36:19.322 --> 00:36:21.923]  And I'm talking to this guy and he's all excited.
[00:36:21.943 --> 00:36:22.644]  He's all pumped up.
[00:36:22.964 --> 00:36:26.286]  You know, I just came from seeing Al Gore, you know, talk about climate change.
[00:36:26.326 --> 00:36:28.608]  And I say, so you believe in climate change?
[00:36:28.628 --> 00:36:29.789]  He's like, oh yeah, you can't deny it.
[00:36:30.209 --> 00:36:33.812]  And he's like, we have pollution and we have all this stuff.
[00:36:33.852 --> 00:36:38.757]  And I was like, well, sir, we've always had hurricanes and tornadoes and earthquakes and so on.
[00:36:38.797 --> 00:36:40.298]  Then he said, well, we have all this pollution.
[00:36:40.318 --> 00:36:43.321]  I was like, yes, we do have a pollution issue on this planet.
[00:36:43.621 --> 00:36:49.186]  But saying, you know, because somebody throws away their pack of fries because of a hurricane doesn't make any sense.
[00:36:49.366 --> 00:36:57.092]  They need to understand that, actually, I was talking about how the bankers are using this, you know, creating liquidity crises in order to restructure sovereignty.
[00:36:58.013 --> 00:37:01.417]  Actually, climate change is really kind of the same sort of thing.
[00:37:01.437 --> 00:37:09.404]  When you look at these carbon credits and these carbon exchange systems and everything, it's got a lot of similarities to the Federal Reserve.
[00:37:09.524 --> 00:37:15.110]  You know, when you look at the private Federal Reserve, we pay them for the privilege of them printing our paper money.
[00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:17.291]  Okay, and we borrow money from them.
[00:37:17.311 --> 00:37:18.411]  Why should we borrow money?
[00:37:18.531 --> 00:37:19.851]  Why should we pay them to do this?
[00:37:19.951 --> 00:37:23.112]  That's a function of government, not a function of some private entity.
[00:37:23.612 --> 00:37:32.375]  And what Al Gore is looking to do on a global basis and these other people, he's not the only one, but he's heavily into this, what they're looking to do is to set up some kind of a
[00:37:33.295 --> 00:37:33.755]  Thank you.
[00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:54.723]  And, you know, that's what they're looking to do.
[00:37:54.763 --> 00:38:02.372]  They're essentially trying to set up a Federal Reserve that is climate based, that is carbon credit, carbon exchanges based.
[00:38:02.432 --> 00:38:11.563]  So they're going to get very, very, very wealthy off of that if everybody that engages in any kind of activity has to pay them an indulgence fee to do so.
[00:38:11.883 --> 00:38:14.325]  Oh yeah, and you tied that together very well, David Knight.
[00:38:14.925 --> 00:38:18.467]  I want to go on to something else before Alex joins us in the next couple of minutes.
[00:38:42.203 --> 00:38:44.824]  I'm sorry, I can't pronounce that.
[00:38:45.144 --> 00:38:55.546]  Simon Bolivar, airport on April 24th, as he was leaving the country and charged yesterday with conspiracy, the use of false documents and delinquent association.
[00:38:55.966 --> 00:39:00.027]  So there's a guy who's out there just trying to get to the bottom of what's going on out there.
[00:39:00.047 --> 00:39:01.468]  You know, he's a documentary filmmaker.
[00:39:01.508 --> 00:39:06.169]  We've seen this other places with journalists and other people being detained, being killed.
[00:39:06.189 --> 00:39:10.750]  And this is just another guy, you know, who's just out there trying to expose what's going on.
[00:39:11.610 --> 00:39:12.371]  Well, it's hard to say.
[00:39:14.053 --> 00:39:16.316]  I don't want to throw the guy under the bus.
[00:39:16.536 --> 00:39:18.358]  I always take these things with a grain of salt.
[00:39:18.378 --> 00:39:21.442]  This is one of the earlier reports, so things may come out.
[00:39:21.482 --> 00:39:26.709]  But thus far, just going off this article, we have to look into what this guy's doing out there.
[00:39:26.749 --> 00:39:27.970]  But it is coming from Bloomberg.
[00:39:28.010 --> 00:39:29.893]  Yeah, and that's another big...
[00:39:30.433 --> 00:39:31.314]  Yeah, so we don't know.
[00:39:31.334 --> 00:39:32.436]  I don't want to throw this guy under the bus.
[00:39:32.476 --> 00:39:36.080]  He may be a genuinely, genuinely be a documentary filmmaker.
[00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:36.540]  Who knows?
[00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:48.614]  I mean, the more we look at all this, like I said, we've got an interview coming up with Seibel Edmonds on the Nightly News tonight, and the more we look at all the CIA fingerprints all over this Boston bombing, and
[00:39:49.255 --> 00:40:00.890]  I tell you, listening to her series of Gladio Part 2, and if anybody doesn't know what Operation Gladio was, do yourself a favor and look it up, even if you just take the time to read a Wikipedia article.
[00:40:01.410 --> 00:40:06.917]  It's absolutely amazing, and it is very central to the idea of false flag terrorism, and what we see is that
[00:40:07.778 --> 00:40:24.562]  The campaign of terror that was going on in Italy in the 1970s was attributed to communist organizations, but it was really an attempt to stop the political gains that communists were having in Italy, and it was really carried out by NATO operatives, pretending to be communists.
[00:40:25.322 --> 00:40:34.964]  And she argues that Gladioke has been continuing in the Middle East, in Turkey, and in the chaos-stan areas, as Gary North is called.
[00:40:35.025 --> 00:40:36.925]  I believe it was Gary North that gave it that name.
[00:40:37.745 --> 00:40:52.475]  But she argues that that's been continuing on and she did this series back in January and it has a lot of ties now that we're seeing open up with this bombing narrative that just happened in Boston.
[00:40:52.535 --> 00:40:55.978]  So check out that interview tonight on the Nightly News.
[00:40:56.778 --> 00:40:58.079]  Yeah, definitely excited for that.
[00:40:58.119 --> 00:41:00.240]  And guys, let me know when Alex has joined us.
[00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:01.981]  I believe he's about ready.
[00:41:02.301 --> 00:41:04.042]  But in the meantime, I'm going to go to this next article.
[00:41:04.483 --> 00:41:04.763]  U.S.
[00:41:04.803 --> 00:41:07.464]  Navy experimenting with drones and blimps.
[00:41:07.504 --> 00:41:10.986]  They're going back to blimps to fight Caribbean drug smugglers.
[00:41:11.327 --> 00:41:12.928]  In the wake of budget cuts, the U.S.
[00:41:12.988 --> 00:41:16.630]  Navy is turning to older technology in the war on drugs.
[00:41:16.650 --> 00:41:18.671]  And you can see it right there, the blimp.
[00:41:19.031 --> 00:41:23.714]  I'm not sure if that's the current type of blimp that they're going to be using, but there's an image of it.
[00:41:23.754 --> 00:41:24.755]  So we see
[00:41:25.515 --> 00:41:26.896]  Just more, just more surveillance.
[00:41:41.631 --> 00:41:48.112]  Okay, and yet we see an article here from the New York Times where millions in CIA ghost money has been paid Afghan president's office.
[00:41:48.453 --> 00:41:53.174]  They called it ghost money, he said, because it came in secret and it left in secret.
[00:41:53.414 --> 00:41:54.474]  So it's ghost money.
[00:41:54.834 --> 00:41:57.875]  But you know, it's a known fact and it's been documented.
[00:41:57.915 --> 00:42:03.816]  If you don't believe the alternative press, you can look at the mainstream press, the New York Times.
[00:42:03.836 --> 00:42:07.397]  They've documented it over and over and over again, how the
[00:42:09.137 --> 00:42:17.404]  The production of poppy seeds, and of course from that you get cocaine, heroin, hashish, a lot of different drugs are derived from poppies.
[00:42:18.064 --> 00:42:23.248]  That had essentially dropped to very, very low levels under the Taliban.
[00:42:23.308 --> 00:42:31.094]  When we came in, the New York Times actually has pictures of American soldiers assisting with the production and transportation.
[00:42:31.274 --> 00:42:33.736]  I believe that was on Fox News.
[00:42:33.776 --> 00:42:40.641]  Geraldo was out there, and the guys were like, we don't like growing this opium, but that's what we have to do, otherwise the farmers will come after us.
[00:42:40.681 --> 00:42:41.181]  Yeah, right.
[00:42:41.722 --> 00:42:42.642]  Our hands are tied.
[00:42:42.922 --> 00:42:45.504]  Yeah, you guys can't take a couple farmers.
[00:42:46.185 --> 00:42:53.050]  But yeah, we've got to prop up their economy, and their economy is based on selling drugs to the United States, so let's jump it up.
[00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:56.452]  So it goes from like 10% of the world's supply to like 90% of the world's supply overnight.
[00:42:56.972 --> 00:42:58.714]  All right, and I do believe Alex is ready.
[00:42:59.474 --> 00:43:00.015]  Alex, can you hear us?
[00:43:01.195 --> 00:43:09.642]  Yes, gentlemen, I'm here listening to you talk about how our government controls the cocaine that comes from coca leaves down in Central and South America and is on record shipping it in.
[00:43:09.662 --> 00:43:14.526]  Then, of course, the opium that is then manufactured and turned into the stronger heroin.
[00:43:14.566 --> 00:43:15.527]  And that's a fact.
[00:43:16.027 --> 00:43:20.231]  Another one of those stubborn things that just hangs out there in plain public view.
[00:43:20.911 --> 00:43:23.714]  But for the ignorant, they just say, oh, it's a conspiracy theory.
[00:43:24.155 --> 00:43:30.561]  The government wouldn't be arresting us and putting us in their private prisons if they were shipping the drugs in.
[00:43:30.582 --> 00:43:39.731]  Well, of course they make it illegal to make the market more lucrative so they can selectively arrest anybody that tries to compete with them.
[00:43:40.632 --> 00:43:42.954]  And I know that most our listeners know this.
[00:43:43.555 --> 00:43:46.157]  Most of our listeners are aware of this.
[00:43:47.118 --> 00:43:50.480]  But there are just so many examples of this throughout history.
[00:43:50.500 --> 00:44:00.689]  And for the radio show, and we've got a stack of special reports we haven't even gotten to yet from last week that are on presentplanet.tv that we should air here on the radio, but there's just so much breaking news.
[00:44:01.109 --> 00:44:03.591]  We should do a whole report on the opium
[00:44:04.452 --> 00:44:05.452]  We're good to go.
[00:44:23.442 --> 00:44:24.523]  That's highly addictive.
[00:44:24.543 --> 00:44:25.143]  I mean, think about this.
[00:44:25.163 --> 00:44:27.044]  This is how they legalize slavery today.
[00:44:27.384 --> 00:44:39.630]  They say, if we catch you using a product that's highly addictive, that we advertise in movies and TV, that we sell via prescriptions as well, the prescription version of, if we catch you using it,
[00:44:40.663 --> 00:44:42.085]  Then we're going to put you in a prison.
[00:44:42.405 --> 00:44:49.454]  But then in many of these cities, the only jobs you've really got above McDonald's, if you're lucky, is selling drugs where you can make large profits.
[00:44:50.135 --> 00:44:54.921]  And then the police just kind of selectively, when they need to fill the prisons, go and arrest a few of the drug dealers.
[00:44:54.961 --> 00:44:56.302]  I mean, for the naive out there,
[00:44:57.123 --> 00:44:59.005]  There's two different worlds, more and more I realize.
[00:44:59.365 --> 00:45:13.480]  There's those of us that are aware, and those of us that aren't aware, and then in between that are those that are predatory who are aware, who try to attack and demonize those of us that are moral, who are trying to stop what's happening, and try to keep the other group in the dark.
[00:45:14.020 --> 00:45:15.542]  They try to keep them in the dark for life.
[00:45:16.701 --> 00:45:21.102]  And a great example of that is out of the Washington Examiner today, up on InfoWars.com.
[00:45:21.182 --> 00:45:23.723]  I got it from DrudgeReport.com.
[00:45:24.683 --> 00:45:26.063]  And it's a national editorial.
[00:45:26.183 --> 00:45:29.344]  No federal endorsement for Southern Poverty Law Center.
[00:45:29.364 --> 00:45:32.004]  This is exactly what we should be talking about.
[00:45:32.044 --> 00:45:43.487]  And it turns out that shooters and killers and people take the news of Southern Poverty Law Center, demonizing libertarians and conservatives, and then go and shoot and attack and kill people.
[00:45:44.467 --> 00:46:01.979]  Floyd Corkins, 28, learns his fate July 15th when he returns to federal court in the District of Columbia for sentencing for his February 6th guilty plea for three felonies including interstate transportation of firearms and ammunition, assault with intent to kill while armed, and committing an act of terrorism while armed.
[00:46:01.999 --> 00:46:04.421]  He could be sentenced to 40 years in federal prison.
[00:46:04.461 --> 00:46:08.224]  We have that clip last week up on the site where he said, I did it, I went and attacked.
[00:46:09.585 --> 00:46:09.885]  I don't know.
[00:46:25.310 --> 00:46:26.131]  The federal government.
[00:46:26.271 --> 00:46:29.014]  I mean, that's pedophilia, whether it's heterosexual or homosexual.
[00:46:29.415 --> 00:46:35.302]  But see, you still don't say that anybody should go shoot Jocelyn Elders for pushing that years ago.
[00:46:35.422 --> 00:46:36.043]  Absolutely not.
[00:46:36.083 --> 00:46:39.247]  We should shoot her down with the words, with the truth.
[00:46:39.907 --> 00:46:41.309]  Not, not, not with a gun.
[00:46:42.290 --> 00:46:55.878]  Even if he gets only half that much jail time, Corkins will forever be known for entering the Family Research Council's Washington headquarters on August 15, 2012 and firing three shots before being subdued by a wounded security guard.
[00:46:56.439 --> 00:47:02.703]  And he went on to say he did it because of the Southern Property Law Center and there have been other attacks and things that go on.
[00:47:03.436 --> 00:47:08.380]  And, you know, my point is the Southern Primary Law Center came out in federal court documents that Jesse Trinity sued and got.
[00:47:09.061 --> 00:47:14.085]  The different newspapers, especially in Salt Lake, reported on this a few years ago.
[00:47:14.566 --> 00:47:19.089]  He was able to get the documents in federal lawsuits over his brother's death.
[00:47:20.070 --> 00:47:33.061]  uh... and also because of Carol Howe and other informers that blew the whistle that the Southern Providence Law Center was running the command base that was in command of McVeigh who himself was another pentagon infiltrator who they just set up.
[00:47:33.821 --> 00:47:42.928]  And see, why did I say watch the Boston Bombers be on CIA payroll and being flown around and being protected by the State Department in the stands, Dagestan and other areas?
[00:47:42.968 --> 00:47:43.209]  Because
[00:47:43.849 --> 00:47:46.732]  They don't even let you go there and come back, basically, nowadays.
[00:47:47.112 --> 00:47:47.913]  Unless you're part of that.
[00:47:47.953 --> 00:47:49.354]  It turns out, sure enough, they were.
[00:47:49.794 --> 00:47:51.936]  That's the big elephant in the room nobody wants to talk about.
[00:47:51.956 --> 00:47:54.038]  I mean, bare minimum.
[00:47:56.018 --> 00:48:01.302]  Bare minimum, they were allowed to attack and they knew that they were extremist nutballs and they protected them.
[00:48:01.322 --> 00:48:02.162]  That's now come out.
[00:48:02.823 --> 00:48:06.985]  Four different, first it was one, then two, then three, then four federal agencies knew and stood down.
[00:48:07.286 --> 00:48:08.426]  Boom, false flag period.
[00:48:08.947 --> 00:48:13.710]  You know somebody's going to do something, you open the door for them, you help them, you're involved.
[00:48:13.770 --> 00:48:16.412]  It's a false flag to take liberty and freedom and distract the public.
[00:48:16.432 --> 00:48:23.757]  But getting back to this, Southern Poverty Law Center comes off like a bunch of, you know, dope, smoking, trendy hippies.
[00:48:23.777 --> 00:48:25.138]  That's kind of their public face.
[00:48:26.508 --> 00:48:30.171]  I even ran into one of their employees one time and he was like, oh, we're not that bad.
[00:48:30.191 --> 00:48:30.892]  We're just hippies.
[00:48:31.372 --> 00:48:32.573]  And I'm like, don't give me that crap.
[00:48:32.613 --> 00:48:35.396]  He goes, well, actually we do spend like 30 million a year in security alone.
[00:48:36.075 --> 00:48:37.956]  They get hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:48:38.016 --> 00:48:38.737]  I forget the number.
[00:48:38.977 --> 00:48:39.898]  It's in the hundreds of millions.
[00:48:39.938 --> 00:48:42.200]  Guys, pull up annual.
[00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:46.043]  I think it may have been in like five years they got something like $200 million from the feds.
[00:48:46.083 --> 00:48:46.963]  I forget the exact number.
[00:48:47.524 --> 00:48:52.467]  The point is that it's their job to go out and demonize anybody that's a liberty lover.
[00:48:52.848 --> 00:49:00.774]  And then clearly they have sister organizations via the FBI, like Hal Turner, who I said for a decade was definitely an FBI asset.
[00:49:01.474 --> 00:49:07.036]  Because he would say kill judges, kill people, by the way, go after Alex Jones almost every time he broadcast.
[00:49:07.696 --> 00:49:21.901]  And some of the most vicious people coming after me were mentally ill white supremacists wound up by Hal Turner, who is now in federal prison because when hackers got into his email and released the fact that he was a quote national security asset above FBI.
[00:49:23.257 --> 00:49:25.739]  Speaking through the FBI to a group above FBI.
[00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:32.324]  That's Justice Department, that's Eric Holder and his cut-out group in my research.
[00:49:33.225 --> 00:49:36.007]  Groups like the Southern Property Law Center that are at Justice Department and above.
[00:49:36.188 --> 00:49:41.372]  Because they use foundations that can act outside of oversight to basically get away with anything.
[00:49:42.885 --> 00:49:48.647]  And so again, when those hundreds of emails got released with him being handled by the FBI, that's how lazy they are.
[00:49:48.887 --> 00:49:56.789]  Like people wouldn't find out that he wasn't going to a park to get his orders in a satchel, like you're supposed to if you're one of these operatives, historically.
[00:49:56.829 --> 00:49:57.970]  You just do it via email.
[00:49:58.230 --> 00:50:05.532]  And there he was, trying to wind up, that's what they called it, mentally ill extremist ex-cons and people to do bad things.
[00:50:05.852 --> 00:50:06.972]  And of course I knew he was a fed.
[00:50:07.032 --> 00:50:08.333]  Attacking me every day?
[00:50:09.393 --> 00:50:12.336]  Saying kill judges over and over again for years, never getting in trouble?
[00:50:13.256 --> 00:50:17.800]  I mean, most people that attack us, you go look them up and they're saying, blow up the Federal Reserve.
[00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:22.323]  I mean, if I said that, there'd be police cars in an hour wherever I was.
[00:50:22.844 --> 00:50:25.126]  I mean, police cars, boom, handcuffs, gone.
[00:50:25.146 --> 00:50:26.787]  Because I'm not a globalist, I'm not a Fed.
[00:50:27.527 --> 00:50:30.089]  And they would go, oh, we don't control that, Alex isn't a Fed.
[00:50:30.450 --> 00:50:32.371]  But when they do this stuff, they get away with it.
[00:50:32.411 --> 00:50:34.293]  So it shouldn't just not get federal funding.
[00:50:35.140 --> 00:50:41.045]  It shouldn't just not get federal funding in the hundreds of millions of dollars over the years.
[00:50:41.906 --> 00:50:52.774]  It should be investigated by Congress, because this is the group trying to radicalize politics and demonize anybody that is anywhere near a constitutionalist, anyone that admires freedom.
[00:50:53.095 --> 00:50:55.496]  They are authoritarians posing as liberals.
[00:50:55.717 --> 00:51:00.741]  We'll be right back with a bunch of other key news on abortions and how they're trying to cover up the grisly facts.
[00:51:02.546 --> 00:51:08.412]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our immunity and health.

[00:53:17.873 --> 00:53:24.095]  You asked for it, we listened, and we made our new fake TV three times brighter than our previous model.
[00:53:24.355 --> 00:53:27.957]  The brightness of our new fake TV is equivalent to a 40-inch TV.
[00:53:28.437 --> 00:53:33.220]  It simulates the color and motion of a real TV while you're away from home.
[00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:39.883]  And when burglars think someone is home watching television, they're likely to pass your house and move on to an easier target.
[00:53:40.224 --> 00:53:44.646]  The new, brighter fake TV is only $39.95 and includes free shipping.
[00:53:45.026 --> 00:53:47.627]  Go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.
[00:53:50.549 --> 00:53:56.716]  That's 877-532-5388, or go to Faketv.com.
[00:53:57.276 --> 00:53:59.759]  Faketv, the burglar deterrent.
[00:54:07.847 --> 00:54:09.689]  Okay, folks, Jakari Jackson.
[00:54:11.158 --> 00:54:14.841]  David Knight will be riding shotgun a little bit with me in the next hour.
[00:54:14.861 --> 00:54:16.962]  They're kind of like Houston, and I'm up here on the space capsule.
[00:54:16.982 --> 00:54:18.603]  If there's any technical difficulties, they'll pop in.
[00:54:18.643 --> 00:54:19.684]  Also, I have some news updates.
[00:54:20.064 --> 00:54:25.048]  William F. Jasper, I don't have his bio in front of me, but I know he's been editor of the New American from time to time.
[00:54:25.969 --> 00:54:35.355]  He is going to be joining us coming up, because he wrote an article last week for the New American Magazine dealing with the EU and bankers bragging that they're an authoritarian system.
[00:54:35.375 --> 00:54:37.037]  So I think it's important to get him on to talk about
[00:54:37.597 --> 00:54:40.538]  Kind of the history of the John Birch Society, too, that's been so demonized.
[00:54:40.878 --> 00:54:42.198]  They just count on you being dumbed down.
[00:54:42.218 --> 00:54:43.679]  And, oh, that's that discredited group.
[00:54:43.699 --> 00:54:45.039]  Like, Alex is discredited.
[00:54:45.059 --> 00:54:46.299]  We didn't buy any bullets.
[00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:52.381]  Yeah, we bought a bunch of bullets, but it's no big deal.
[00:54:52.421 --> 00:54:54.722]  Yeah, they're discredited because the bullets aren't to shoot you.
[00:54:55.262 --> 00:54:59.903]  Now, getting back to the Southern Poverty Law Center, they have the expanded definition of hate.
[00:55:00.343 --> 00:55:01.544]  And I went to Sourcewatch.
[00:55:02.584 --> 00:55:08.607]  Their assets are at $189,000,000.7 and they've been known to raise over $100,000,000 a year according to their 501c3 tax filings I'm looking at from SourceWatch.org.
[00:55:17.991 --> 00:55:22.493]  I knew those hundreds of millions of numbers were accurate, so it's 189 million in assets, .7.
[00:55:23.034 --> 00:55:24.935]  They get fundraising, but also federal funds.
[00:55:25.175 --> 00:55:36.561]  And just a few weeks ago we saw the Fox News article showing the Army manuals saying all Christians, Catholics, Evangelicals, you name it, are next to Al Qaeda and are extremist terror organizations.
[00:55:36.601 --> 00:55:37.361]  That's Fox News.
[00:55:38.021 --> 00:55:43.084]  And I recognize the flyer graphics, because I've seen it in so many federal documents, it's Southern Providence Law Center.
[00:55:44.181 --> 00:55:49.306]  About 80% of the time it's their documents with a new name on it.
[00:55:50.026 --> 00:55:52.248]  And about 15-20% of the time it's ADL.
[00:55:52.588 --> 00:55:53.549]  And I've learned how they look.
[00:55:53.569 --> 00:55:54.330]  They're very lazy.
[00:55:54.350 --> 00:55:57.473]  I mean, you just keep regurgitating the same lies.
[00:55:58.073 --> 00:56:01.296]  And the expanded definition of hate is families are hateful.
[00:56:01.677 --> 00:56:03.818]  Being white in and of itself is hateful.
[00:56:04.179 --> 00:56:05.140]  Of course, they're mainly white.
[00:56:06.100 --> 00:56:07.721]  It's just all about divide and conquer.
[00:56:07.741 --> 00:56:09.902]  They're the ones selling racial division.
[00:56:10.143 --> 00:56:13.384]  And now you've got Billy Graham's son pushing their line.
[00:56:13.404 --> 00:56:14.825]  You've got the Southern Baptist Convention.
[00:56:15.906 --> 00:56:18.848]  Might as well just come out for the Communist Party USA.
[00:56:19.188 --> 00:56:20.188]  This is the takeover.
[00:56:20.208 --> 00:56:23.330]  They're all moving right now in their cultural revolution.
[00:56:23.390 --> 00:56:24.871]  By the way, it's not going too well for them.
[00:56:25.211 --> 00:56:29.553]  The problem is they're in power, so they're getting what they want done while waking everyone up.
[00:56:29.953 --> 00:56:38.936]  And David, you've done some reports on this specifically, where they've then had army colonels come out and vomit Southern Poverty Law Center trash all over everyone.
[00:56:39.357 --> 00:56:40.197]  Tell folks about that.
[00:56:40.717 --> 00:56:47.446]  Well, just a couple of weeks ago we had an email that surfaced that attacked both the American Family Association and the Family Research Council.
[00:56:47.466 --> 00:56:56.057]  And the Family Research Council is the organization that you led off with, that this guy who was inspired by the Southern Poverty Law Center went in and started trying to shoot people up.
[00:56:56.778 --> 00:57:01.042]  And this Lieutenant Colonel Jack Rich sent out an email to his subordinates.
[00:57:01.062 --> 00:57:06.488]  It was quite a lengthy list of subordinates that he sent this out to, warning them about specific groups.
[00:57:06.548 --> 00:57:12.593]  And one of the first ones, first couple ones he warned about were the Family Research Council and the American Family Association.
[00:57:12.654 --> 00:57:13.775]  He said they were hate groups.
[00:57:14.175 --> 00:57:16.677]  He said they didn't share Army values.
[00:57:17.438 --> 00:57:24.344]  And what he was doing was linking them together with the Westboro Baptist people, who truly, in my opinion, is a very hateful group.
[00:57:24.404 --> 00:57:25.405]  They're the ones who show up.
[00:57:25.425 --> 00:57:26.346]  Oh, come on, you know.
[00:57:26.366 --> 00:57:29.048]  I bet a lot of money those guys are federal funded.
[00:57:29.268 --> 00:57:29.849]  Yeah, right.
[00:57:30.009 --> 00:57:34.072]  I mean, I've seen long, extended films of them, and it's definitely a big act.
[00:57:34.793 --> 00:57:36.575]  But it's really crazy.
[00:57:36.735 --> 00:57:40.939]  Westboro Baptist Church, they're absolutely insane.
[00:57:41.419 --> 00:57:52.989]  But the American Family Research, the American Family Association and Family Research Council are very mainstream evangelical protestant organizations and they are not hate organizations but they're labeled as such.
[00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:56.753]  And they're also now more and more getting shot up.
[00:57:57.193 --> 00:57:57.353]  I don't
[00:58:13.295 --> 00:58:15.838]  What is the Pentagon involved in rural affairs?
[00:58:15.898 --> 00:58:17.900]  What is the Pentagon in the Rural Council?
[00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:21.623]  What is the Pentagon doing saying Christians are bad, Army don't look at it?
[00:58:21.863 --> 00:58:25.967]  This is a domestic, hardcore, collectivist takeover.
[00:58:26.047 --> 00:58:29.150]  Communists funded by offshore banks that want to break this country.
[00:58:29.470 --> 00:58:37.858]  And whether it's the Army, the FBI, or local police, they are all trained by open, un-American scum who now are going after mainline Christians.
[00:58:37.898 --> 00:58:38.679]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:44.144 --> 00:58:48.121]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:52.165 --> 00:59:03.490]  With health threats on the rise such as West Nile virus, MRSA, CRE, and now the new bird flu recently discovered in China, there has never been a more crucial time to support your immune system.
[00:59:03.790 --> 00:59:16.676]  Supernatural Silver is a revolutionary new silver solution that is clinically shown to be several hundred times more effective than colloidal or ionic silver, and is powerful enough to help protect you and your family.
[00:59:17.016 --> 00:59:20.998]  Supernatural Silver is scientifically supported, highly effective,
[00:59:21.238 --> 00:59:24.580]  And perfect for everyday use inside the body as well as out.
[00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:26.341]  The Science Digest Journal says,
[00:59:54.526 --> 00:59:56.450]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.911 --> 00:59:59.738]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:06.260 --> 01:00:10.423]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:11.083 --> 01:00:11.904]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.685 --> 01:00:13.585]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:14.226 --> 01:00:17.848]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.409 --> 01:00:22.472]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:26.593 --> 01:00:27.734]  Alright, we're into hour number two.
[01:00:27.794 --> 01:00:28.554]  I'm on the road.
[01:00:28.574 --> 01:00:32.396]  Jakari Jackson and, of course, David Knight doing a great job.
[01:00:32.416 --> 01:00:35.798]  I'm going to be back by Wednesday, but we're going to have Mike Adams in for three hours.
[01:00:36.798 --> 01:00:39.060]  On Wednesday, I'll probably be popping in there as well.
[01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:41.541]  And I'm not sure what we're going to do on tomorrow's show.
[01:00:41.581 --> 01:00:44.522]  I may do it from the road, driving in the bus like I did before.
[01:00:45.803 --> 01:00:48.705]  One time, from the front seat of the bus next to Richard.
[01:00:49.406 --> 01:00:50.927]  So we're going to see what happens tomorrow.
[01:00:51.788 --> 01:00:53.329]  But there's so much breaking news.
[01:00:53.349 --> 01:00:58.593]  If you go up to Infowars.com, George W. Bush suggests Boston bombings were a conspiracy.
[01:00:59.093 --> 01:01:00.434]  Pretty powerful video.
[01:01:01.355 --> 01:01:04.177]  I thought he said never tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories.
[01:01:05.177 --> 01:01:05.398]  U.S.
[01:01:05.418 --> 01:01:07.959]  moves closer to military intervention in Syria.
[01:01:07.979 --> 01:01:08.760]  That's Kurt Nemo's article.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.262]  They're already doing military intervention with proxies.
[01:01:11.682 --> 01:01:13.584]  They mean overt military bombing.
[01:01:14.717 --> 01:01:22.245]  And, you know, after they do their deal with Russia, they like kind of stage an event, blame their own assets, let the Russians clean out the CIA's own people.
[01:01:22.706 --> 01:01:25.189]  You give us Syria, we'll get our people out of Dagestan.
[01:01:26.161 --> 01:01:27.962]  I mean, this is just amazing.
[01:01:28.062 --> 01:01:31.423]  It's like Hitler and Stalin dividing Poland or something.
[01:01:31.443 --> 01:01:32.384]  That's how government works.
[01:01:32.884 --> 01:01:36.446]  I agree with Seibel Edmunds' breakdown on that a few days ago.
[01:01:37.146 --> 01:01:39.487]  Mother of bombing suspects says it's all lies.
[01:01:39.527 --> 01:01:41.028]  That's all up at InfoWars.com.
[01:01:41.368 --> 01:01:42.128]  Multiple polls.
[01:01:42.168 --> 01:01:44.950]  Americans are more afraid of government than the terrorists.
[01:01:45.010 --> 01:01:45.470]  That's right.
[01:01:45.530 --> 01:01:47.451]  But the government has electronic voting in now, so...
[01:01:48.231 --> 01:01:50.773]  Yes, it doesn't matter what you want, unless you enforce the Constitution.
[01:01:52.174 --> 01:01:53.795]  And that's just some of what's going to be coming up.
[01:01:54.016 --> 01:01:56.477]  William F. Jasper is going to be joining us.
[01:01:56.918 --> 01:02:00.320]  But putting bookends on this, David Knight, we're talking about the Southern Property Law Center.
[01:02:01.345 --> 01:02:10.328]  That Harper's wrote about in 2007, and they got their tax returns, 501c3, $189.7 million, a lot of it government funding.
[01:02:11.748 --> 01:02:15.109]  Approximately 60% of their total expenses were spent on program services.
[01:02:15.149 --> 01:02:16.010]  They live like kings.
[01:02:16.890 --> 01:02:28.894]  In 2009, that's the latest numbers, and they still, every professional I know, my dad's a dentist, every lawyer he knows, gets mailed the magazine, which I'm always in.
[01:02:29.614 --> 01:02:30.695]  Or almost every time I've seen it.
[01:02:30.775 --> 01:02:39.961]  It's a quarterly magazine where they put toothless Klan members run by feds next to mainline Christian groups, some of the biggest in the country.
[01:02:40.541 --> 01:02:43.603]  I mean, they just say, hey, we shouldn't teach five year olds how to masturbate.
[01:02:43.944 --> 01:02:45.785]  And they're like, these people are evil.
[01:02:46.205 --> 01:02:47.666]  And then the guy goes in and shoots them.
[01:02:47.766 --> 01:02:48.867]  And it's like, so what?
[01:02:48.907 --> 01:02:49.487]  We're liberal.
[01:02:50.388 --> 01:02:52.049]  I mean, it's just it's just over the top.
[01:02:53.110 --> 01:02:55.211]  And again, they're here for an authoritarian takeover.
[01:02:55.231 --> 01:02:56.052]  I'm not just saying that.
[01:02:56.352 --> 01:02:59.214]  David Knight, the final comments on that before I come back and talk to Jasper.
[01:02:59.954 --> 01:03:02.216]  I think what you said earlier, Alex, is the key.
[01:03:02.336 --> 01:03:13.146]  You've got to ask yourself, not only why would the Army attack mainstream organizations like the Family Research Council and the American Family Association, but why is the Army doing this?
[01:03:13.166 --> 01:03:21.773]  It's kind of like when you saw the Waco, when that was unfolding, we were told that they had to do that to protect the children and that there were child abuse charges.
[01:03:21.793 --> 01:03:22.114]  It's like,
[01:03:22.714 --> 01:03:25.458]  That's not the jurisdiction of the federal ATF.
[01:03:25.918 --> 01:03:27.961]  They could have arrested him in town every day.
[01:03:27.981 --> 01:03:29.163]  They wanted the big fight.
[01:03:29.443 --> 01:03:31.365]  They wanted to kick off the domestic purge.
[01:03:31.446 --> 01:03:35.791]  They hate gun-owning Christians, so they picked a weird group to set the precedent.
[01:03:36.272 --> 01:03:38.435]  These people just don't want power.
[01:03:38.535 --> 01:03:39.236]  They hate us.
[01:03:39.616 --> 01:03:40.778]  You can figure this out.
[01:03:41.078 --> 01:03:41.959]  It's the same sort of thing here.
[01:03:41.979 --> 01:03:44.820]  You've got to ask yourself, why is the Army weighing in on this?
[01:03:45.180 --> 01:03:54.526]  Why is the Army telling people that the Family Research Council and the American Family Association are hateful groups, that they're hate groups, and they don't share Army values?
[01:03:54.706 --> 01:03:56.847]  By the way, they're incredibly milquetoast.
[01:03:56.867 --> 01:03:57.867]  They're incredibly milquetoast.
[01:03:57.907 --> 01:04:07.113]  I mean, look, the Army document three weeks ago, Fox News, says evangelicals, by the way, are worshiping the Southern Property Law Center, and all Catholics
[01:04:08.073 --> 01:04:09.855]  Are extremists next to Al Qaeda?
[01:04:09.915 --> 01:04:13.519]  I mean, where are the Catholic groups up in arms about this?
[01:04:13.899 --> 01:04:16.602]  That's a big group to say all the Catholics, period.
[01:04:16.902 --> 01:04:17.723]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:04:18.423 --> 01:04:20.205]  So, I guess that's the thing.
[01:04:20.646 --> 01:04:29.114]  That, along with, and we've seen this happening over and over again, we've seen army manuals where they're wargaming in South Carolina against the Tea Party.
[01:04:29.934 --> 01:04:34.075]  We see the MIAC report that was broken by InfoWars back in 2009.
[01:04:34.616 --> 01:04:49.400]  We see this narrative coming over and over again, and you have to ask yourself, you know, not only do we have a standing army now, permanent professional standing army, which is against Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution, but now they're definitely turning their sights on the American people.
[01:04:50.151 --> 01:04:50.431]  That's right.
[01:04:50.451 --> 01:04:52.473]  They're demonizing us, saying we're the bad guys.
[01:04:52.493 --> 01:04:57.317]  And then we say, hey, what are the armored vehicles and machine guns and checkpoints and bullets for?
[01:04:57.337 --> 01:04:59.479]  They go, that's a conspiracy theory.
[01:04:59.619 --> 01:05:00.199]  Don't run.
[01:05:00.239 --> 01:05:01.220]  We are your friends.
[01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:04.963]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms.
[01:05:05.303 --> 01:05:10.728]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[01:05:11.348 --> 01:05:14.550]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?

[01:06:01.621 --> 01:06:03.542]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[01:06:03.562 --> 01:06:05.824]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[01:06:05.984 --> 01:06:12.007]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.

[01:08:14.298 --> 01:08:17.923]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:18.484 --> 01:08:22.549]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:26.755 --> 01:08:35.179]  Alright, coming up at the bottom of the hour, we'll have more breaking news from InfoWars.com, another top liberty-minded site from around the world.
[01:08:36.700 --> 01:08:41.482]  Right now, though, for the balance of the hour, we are joined by William F. Jasper.
[01:08:41.542 --> 01:08:47.765]  He is the senior editor at the New American magazine, TheNewAmerican.com.
[01:08:48.625 --> 01:08:52.367]  And, of course, he also is their main correspondent to the United Nations.
[01:08:52.407 --> 01:08:53.908]  He travels all over the world.
[01:08:54.727 --> 01:08:59.673]  And of course, I followed his work earnestly when I discovered it in about 1993, 94, 95.
[01:09:00.534 --> 01:09:05.399]  The John Birch Society films that were aired on local access TV helped expand my awakening.
[01:09:05.820 --> 01:09:14.069]  I kind of grew up around history and things, so I just knew what they were saying was true because it was verifiable in the, even by the time I was 20 years old, hundreds of history books I had read.
[01:09:15.190 --> 01:09:30.553]  And the first time I met William F. Jasper personally, I had him on as a guest a few times, was at Operation Urban Warrior, where the military was openly training with role players to confiscate guns in California.
[01:09:30.573 --> 01:09:37.694]  And I was there shooting video of the Navy vessel Coronado dumping out thousands of Marines and troops from five nations.
[01:09:37.754 --> 01:09:39.955]  And I'd go into, they'd say, sure you can come in with the press, and they would
[01:09:40.475 --> 01:09:43.877]  They would sit there and train and say, where'd you get the guns and ammo and the helmet?
[01:09:43.917 --> 01:09:45.278]  Well, I got it in San Francisco.
[01:09:45.298 --> 01:09:49.161]  And then they'd have a Colonel Jones run up and say, Jones can't film that!
[01:09:49.221 --> 01:09:49.902]  Get out of here!
[01:09:50.222 --> 01:09:51.843]  They'd go, but sir, you said he could be here!
[01:09:52.524 --> 01:09:55.666]  So, and then Colonel Hart would run up on video and get very upset.
[01:09:56.126 --> 01:09:58.308]  So they did not want people seeing what is in Police State 2000.
[01:09:58.508 --> 01:10:00.930]  So the first time I met Jasper then.
[01:10:02.270 --> 01:10:06.531]  Now, the John Birch Society, I want to get him on today, just do a brief history of it.
[01:10:07.471 --> 01:10:11.853]  I'm not a member of it, never been part of it, just because, you know, I've read the material.
[01:10:11.893 --> 01:10:16.054]  I guess I'm kind of a, to use the communist term, but in a joking way, a fellow traveler.
[01:10:16.414 --> 01:10:23.336]  I grew up with my dad having their publications and Bobby Vaughn, a John Birch Society member in Dallas, coming over when I was a kid, you know.
[01:10:24.036 --> 01:10:35.498]  I'd hear him around the coffee table drinking coffee, talking about the New World Order, the Federal Reserve, the plan to destroy the family, the plan of the megabanks to create world communism that they're exempt from, basically everything we see today.
[01:10:36.418 --> 01:10:46.360]  And I want to get him on about an article he wrote last week that we linked to on Infowars.com, dealing with the EU bragging that, oh yes, we're taking over in an authoritarian way.
[01:10:46.740 --> 01:10:51.961]  They've also done that in the Financial Times of London bragged in an article called, and now for world government.
[01:10:52.521 --> 01:10:57.963]  Where they said, yes, we've been secretive, yes, we're authoritarian, yes, we're taking over, and yes, there's nothing you can do.
[01:10:59.244 --> 01:11:04.766]  So they've gone from denying all of this to saying, okay, you're discredited because you don't want world government.
[01:11:04.786 --> 01:11:08.188]  It's kind of like a year ago when they'd only bought a billion bullets, now it's over two billion.
[01:11:09.068 --> 01:11:15.190]  There are no billion bullets, there are no armored vehicles, there are no manuals training to take on the American people and veterans and gun owners.
[01:11:15.691 --> 01:11:21.053]  Now they're like, of course there are manuals to take you on, and of course we have two billion bullets, but they're not to kill you.
[01:11:22.287 --> 01:11:23.827]  That was the new thing in Congress last week.
[01:11:23.847 --> 01:11:25.228]  We played clips on the Sunday Show.
[01:11:25.288 --> 01:11:42.172]  So, if you ever notice when you watch MSNBC or CNN, when somebody talks about freedom, or somebody talks about sovereignty, or somebody talks about NAFTA and GATT, admitted things, or the Trans-Texas Corridor, they'll go, Ron Paul is insane, that NAFTA highway doesn't exist, even though Texans see it being built and saw the billboards.
[01:11:42.752 --> 01:11:44.132]  They're playing to your ignorance.
[01:11:44.572 --> 01:11:46.673]  But you'll always see them, who they're really scared of,
[01:11:48.371 --> 01:11:52.975]  Saying, oh, that sounds like something from the John Birch Society, and then they'll laugh.
[01:11:53.115 --> 01:11:58.959]  And that's an appeal to emotion for ignorant people watching to go, well, when I hear the word John Birch, I better laugh.
[01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:04.364]  The truth is, the John Birch Society, if you watch the things that Mr. Welsh said back in the fifties when it was founded,
[01:12:05.728 --> 01:12:11.471]  When you watch the things they put in the little blue book that I read when I was about 18, all of it has come true.
[01:12:12.632 --> 01:12:13.792]  Not because they were pressing it.
[01:12:13.832 --> 01:12:20.436]  They had good patriots in the military, in the FBI, in the Congress, who were in the hearings where this was all being announced.
[01:12:20.476 --> 01:12:27.539]  They tried to get this all done in the 50s and 60s when they thought the public would totally trust the government after World War II.
[01:12:27.599 --> 01:12:28.960]  People did trust the government, leave it to Beaver.
[01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:30.541]  This was all announced.
[01:12:31.451 --> 01:12:34.492]  Getting rid of our military, creating a UN military via NATO.
[01:12:34.912 --> 01:12:40.054]  So I want to give him the floor now for the rest of the hour to, as best I can, this stuff really gets me excited.
[01:12:41.754 --> 01:12:47.796]  William F. Jasper, to kind of, this little five minute segment left, talk about the John Birch Society, talk about how right they've been.
[01:12:49.168 --> 01:12:52.830]  Why they've been so demonized, and it's almost put them on the defensive for a while.
[01:12:53.290 --> 01:12:55.311]  I've had their director in studio kind of admit that.
[01:12:55.351 --> 01:12:56.712]  Get off the defense, get on the offense.
[01:12:57.032 --> 01:13:00.614]  So what when traitors sit there and attack you and say you're a liar?
[01:13:00.654 --> 01:13:01.274]  They're the liars.
[01:13:01.815 --> 01:13:03.055]  I mean, that's a sign.
[01:13:03.316 --> 01:13:05.076]  And now people don't believe the lies anymore.
[01:13:05.317 --> 01:13:07.418]  And then get into what the EU is forming into.
[01:13:08.178 --> 01:13:28.927]  What the New World Order is from its deep research, because this is, you know, the head honcho over there at the publication, and just really does amazing research, and has been at all these major UN events, or sent his sub-correspondence to it, and then how things are going, after we talk about the history of JBS, then talk about the current state of world government, and then how it's going for them, where he sees things going.
[01:13:29.207 --> 01:13:35.050]  William S. Jasper of TheNewAmerican.com, we salute you, and we're honored to have you, my friend.
[01:13:35.333 --> 01:13:36.134]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[01:13:36.274 --> 01:13:37.495]  Pleasure being here with you.
[01:13:39.216 --> 01:13:41.978]  The setup you gave me here, I'll just walk right into that.
[01:13:42.539 --> 01:13:48.483]  Probably a lot of your listeners are familiar, at least to some degree, with the John Bird Society.
[01:13:48.503 --> 01:13:57.470]  The John Bird Society publishes the New American Magazine, of which I am the senior editor and UN correspondent and kind of chief cook and bottle washer.
[01:13:59.924 --> 01:14:11.533]  My entry into this is probably similar to a lot of members of the John Birch Society, at least of my generation.
[01:14:11.653 --> 01:14:20.619]  I graduated from college in 1975, but while I was in college my last couple of years, my parents had become
[01:14:21.616 --> 01:14:22.998]  Members of the John Birch Society.
[01:14:23.358 --> 01:14:25.401]  And when I found out about that, I was shocked.
[01:14:25.481 --> 01:14:26.302]  I was dismayed.
[01:14:26.322 --> 01:14:29.606]  I was completely perplexed.
[01:14:29.646 --> 01:14:30.867]  How could this happen?
[01:14:31.208 --> 01:14:38.196]  Because I knew nothing about the John Birch Society, except that somewhere in my deep subconscious, I had this
[01:14:39.176 --> 01:14:50.845]  Uh, image of the Jonbert Zadiez being a very evil, fascist organization, racist organization, somehow connected with the Ku Klux Klan or something like that.
[01:14:51.625 --> 01:14:58.831]  And I found out that a lot of my other friends on campus, colleagues, had pretty much the same impression.
[01:14:59.311 --> 01:15:00.272]  And so I thought, well,
[01:15:00.988 --> 01:15:02.749]  I had better educate my parents.
[01:15:02.769 --> 01:15:03.490]  They're good people.
[01:15:03.570 --> 01:15:04.930]  They certainly aren't fascists.
[01:15:05.010 --> 01:15:09.853]  They were both World War II veterans, fought against the Nazis over in Germany and France, etc.
[01:15:09.893 --> 01:15:10.974]  My mother is an Army nurse.
[01:15:10.994 --> 01:15:13.475]  My dad, 82nd Airborne paratrooper.
[01:15:14.556 --> 01:15:15.837]  Good patriotic people.
[01:15:16.437 --> 01:15:19.959]  My job is the college-educated son to educate them.
[01:15:20.940 --> 01:15:23.381]  And so I started discussing this with them.
[01:15:23.441 --> 01:15:25.362]  They gave me a whole stack of literature.
[01:15:26.363 --> 01:15:29.985]  At that time, the John Birch Society magazine was American Opinion.
[01:15:35.965 --> 01:15:43.491]  So you thought you were going to straighten them up with all your Rockefeller Foundation-funded college schooling, and they actually straightened you up?
[01:15:43.671 --> 01:15:43.851]  Right.
[01:15:44.031 --> 01:15:53.299]  I mean, they gave me a whole stack of books by Ludwig von Mises and Henry Hazlitt and Frederick Hayek, and I started reading all those.
[01:15:53.319 --> 01:15:54.900]  And I'd been studying economics and I thought,
[01:15:55.060 --> 01:15:57.022]  My gosh, how come I've never been exposed to this?
[01:15:57.082 --> 01:16:04.829]  These are top-notch, world-level economists, free-market economists, and why haven't I been exposed to this?
[01:16:05.590 --> 01:16:09.834]  So I began doing a lot of research, and it was very hard for me to overcome.
[01:16:10.538 --> 01:16:24.568]  The biases that I had built into me already, but I spent a lot of time at the university library checking the footnotes, making sure that things weren't being quoted out of context.
[01:16:24.808 --> 01:16:29.511]  And I found myself being reluctantly re-educated.
[01:16:29.531 --> 01:16:30.132]  And I thought, gee,
[01:16:31.148 --> 01:16:32.368]  A lot of this makes sense.
[01:16:32.529 --> 01:16:36.750]  They're calling for constitutional government.
[01:16:36.790 --> 01:16:40.931]  They're calling for getting back to constitutional government.
[01:16:40.951 --> 01:16:42.432]  They're calling for America.
[01:16:42.552 --> 01:16:43.012]  That's right.
[01:16:43.132 --> 01:16:44.732]  That's right.
[01:16:44.752 --> 01:16:53.535]  And they're not only opposed to communism and socialism, but fascism, Nazism, any of the collectivist ideological movements and parties.
[01:16:53.755 --> 01:16:57.636]  Well, wasn't John Birch Society's big evil opposing the Vietnam War, rightly?
[01:16:57.877 --> 01:16:59.077]  Oh, that's so fascist.
[01:16:59.677 --> 01:17:01.299]  Right, and they opposed it.
[01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:08.766]  The John Birch Society opposed it, not for the same reasons that the SDS and the leftists were opposing it.
[01:17:08.786 --> 01:17:11.048]  I mean, those people were calling for a Viet Cong victory.
[01:17:11.769 --> 01:17:19.116]  The John Birch Society said, no, it's wrong for us to be over there supporting, or rather, pretending to fight communism.
[01:17:19.156 --> 01:17:24.181]  They're what we're allowing Castro to build a dictatorship right here at our doorstep.
[01:17:24.622 --> 01:17:28.973]  They rightly understood that it was Hegelian dialectic with the globalists playing both sides of it.
[01:17:29.454 --> 01:17:32.401]  Talk about the name John Birch Society for people that don't know the story.
[01:17:33.055 --> 01:17:39.037]  Well, John Birch was a Baptist missionary just preceding World War II over in China.
[01:17:39.737 --> 01:17:47.740]  And long story short, he had learned Chinese and various Chinese dialects.
[01:17:48.140 --> 01:17:51.161]  He could identify very well with the Chinese people there.
[01:17:51.601 --> 01:17:58.383]  When World War II broke out and the Japanese invaded China, all of the foreign missionaries left, except for him.
[01:17:59.283 --> 01:18:03.285]  He stayed behind, disguised himself as Chinese, traveled all over China.
[01:18:04.045 --> 01:18:13.308]  When we entered into the war, he began and Jimmy Doolittle began doing his flights over China, bombing the Japanese thing.
[01:18:14.228 --> 01:18:18.370]  American pilots were being shot down or were being forced to abandon their planes.
[01:18:18.990 --> 01:18:27.933]  And he developed a network to have land amongst the Chinese there to build landing strips and to have smuggling.
[01:18:28.653 --> 01:18:29.133]  We're good.
[01:18:43.793 --> 01:18:44.434]  I think so.
[01:18:59.163 --> 01:19:01.824]  Uh, he was given one last commission.
[01:19:02.204 --> 01:19:12.188]  He was a missionary, but he was commissioned as a captain in the US Army because of his intelligence capabilities there.
[01:19:12.868 --> 01:19:15.309]  And he was given one last mission which was to go up
[01:19:16.346 --> 01:19:24.852]  Northern China to escort out the Japanese Army so that they wouldn't be, after the armistice, so they wouldn't be molested.
[01:19:25.632 --> 01:19:27.494]  And he was stopped by Chinese Communists.
[01:19:46.887 --> 01:19:48.430]  We would not have known all this info.
[01:19:48.470 --> 01:19:52.236]  I'm telling you, they were the launch pad for the entire giant resistance today.
[01:19:52.696 --> 01:19:57.885]  And everybody should be a part of the John Birch Society, or at least get their materials, because they're the best you're going to find anywhere.
[01:19:58.225 --> 01:19:58.947]  We'll be right back.
[01:19:58.967 --> 01:19:59.387]  Stay with us.
[01:19:59.447 --> 01:20:00.128]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:20:01.590 --> 01:20:05.531]  Bills in front of Congress right now could take away your right to keep and bear arms.
[01:20:05.851 --> 01:20:11.573]  If Obama has his way, all guns will be either banned, restricted, or confiscated, possibly by executive order.
[01:20:12.053 --> 01:20:14.274]  The best way to keep your guns is to hide them.
[01:20:14.434 --> 01:20:16.915]  What Obama can't find, Obama can't take away.
[01:20:17.075 --> 01:20:19.215]  You can protect your guns from any threat.

[01:20:35.550 --> 01:20:43.516]  All emergencies have casualties, but in America, most casualties from storms like Katrina and Sandy only happen because good people were in the wrong place at the wrong time.
[01:20:43.816 --> 01:20:45.157]  Don't let that happen to you.

[01:21:05.991 --> 01:21:08.133]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:21:09.013 --> 01:21:17.357]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[01:21:17.977 --> 01:21:22.880]  Now, 27 years later, carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

[01:22:00.678 --> 01:22:05.120]  Nothing is more American than Diamond Gusset jeans.

[01:22:07.881 --> 01:22:13.164]  Soft and broken in from the start, yet more rugged and durable than any jean you've ever worn.
[01:22:13.804 --> 01:22:16.445]  Have you ever experienced missized jeans from China?
[01:22:16.826 --> 01:22:18.446]  Well, you won't with Diamond Gusset.
[01:22:19.027 --> 01:22:23.429]  Every pair is crafted to fit exactly the same and always feel like they were custom made.

[01:23:01.980 --> 01:23:02.700]  Nice shootin'.
[01:23:02.860 --> 01:23:05.661]  Hey, that's a sweet AK-47 chest rig.
[01:23:05.681 --> 01:23:06.642]  Is that multicam?
[01:23:06.662 --> 01:23:09.183]  Yeah, got it from strikehardgear.com.
[01:23:09.363 --> 01:23:10.064]  Strike what?
[01:23:10.704 --> 01:23:12.045]  Strike hard.

[01:23:27.977 --> 01:23:29.658]  Go ahead, pull the trigger.
[01:23:29.898 --> 01:23:39.164]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, and carting to a private bank, having it lent back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[01:23:39.224 --> 01:23:39.945]  This capitalism?
[01:23:40.005 --> 01:23:46.149]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:23:46.289 --> 01:23:47.069]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[01:23:47.090 --> 01:23:50.192]  I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[01:23:50.252 --> 01:23:51.172]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[01:23:51.192 --> 01:23:52.513]  It's time to understand the system.
[01:23:52.573 --> 01:23:52.853]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:23:52.893 --> 01:23:53.174]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:23:59.838 --> 01:24:00.005]  Yeah.
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:33.219]  fitting music to talk about the John Birch Society helping get the Flying Tigers into there to fight the Japanese and then of course at the end of the war it was the John Birch Society that first said in the 50s that Mao had been put in power by our government that was declassified about a decade ago I was watching Discovery Channel
[01:24:33.559 --> 01:24:34.360]  Was it History Channel?
[01:24:34.380 --> 01:24:36.523]  They had the old CIA section chief admit it.
[01:24:36.543 --> 01:24:37.764]  And then I went and looked it up.
[01:24:37.804 --> 01:24:44.112]  There'd been an announcement in the news that, oh, the government thought Mao would be a stabilizing effect, the greatest mass murderer in history.
[01:24:44.152 --> 01:24:50.861]  But we'll talk about what happened to old John Birch when he tried to actually help the Chinese people he loved so much against tyranny.
[01:24:51.281 --> 01:24:55.065]  Okay, so he's helped defeat the Japanese against the millions the Japanese killed.
[01:24:55.425 --> 01:25:02.051]  Incredible war crimes there that dwarf what happened to the US, or even the Koreans for that matter, that the Japanese viciously attacked.
[01:25:02.091 --> 01:25:06.135]  I'm not demonizing Japanese now, that's just Imperial Japan, we're like the Nazis.
[01:25:06.555 --> 01:25:14.623]  Now expanding, go ahead and finish with what happened, William F. Jasper, editor-in-chief over there, senior editor over there at the New America Magazine.
[01:25:15.216 --> 01:25:23.581]  Well, Captain John Birch was sent to escort out the Japanese army out of northern China.
[01:25:24.502 --> 01:25:32.587]  And on his way there, he was stopped by Chinese Communist troops and was murdered by them.
[01:25:33.586 --> 01:25:37.507]  And that is not surprising, because that's what communists do.
[01:25:37.707 --> 01:25:51.331]  But remember, this is the end of World War II, and Americans, or the triumphant victors, could be very bad news to kill an American hero.
[01:25:51.371 --> 01:26:02.054]  I mean, John Birch should have received numerous additional citations, to which he did receive, and probably would have gotten a Medal of Honor, things of that nature, except for
[01:26:02.974 --> 01:26:04.935]  This murder was covered up.
[01:26:05.695 --> 01:26:06.635]  Why was it covered up?
[01:26:06.775 --> 01:26:13.417]  Our State Department, which was being run by communists at that time... Wasn't he also tortured?
[01:26:13.437 --> 01:26:15.337]  Yes, he was tortured, bayoneted, and murdered.
[01:26:22.126 --> 01:26:47.117]  And this wouldn't fly very well, though, with our State Department and our government, the Roosevelt and Truman administrations, trying to convince the American people that the Chinese Communists under Mao Zedong and Xu Jie were our allies, going to be the people that we should be turning China over to, which is what we did.
[01:26:47.137 --> 01:26:48.978]  They began demonizing
[01:26:50.258 --> 01:26:50.638]  Thank you.
[01:27:10.566 --> 01:27:24.872]  You've had the sugar daddy or sugar babies or one of these guys that invented those and he had poured all of his money into alerting the American people about the dangers of socialism and big government here at home and of communism abroad.
[01:27:25.352 --> 01:27:34.916]  Now for younger generations today who don't even know who Stalin or Mao or Fidel Castro is or were and have no idea about the
[01:27:36.997 --> 01:27:50.564]  Climate in the 1940s 50s and 60s 70s when communism was taking over one country after another that might be hard to fathom but Americans at that time understood that there was something really bad in the world.
[01:27:50.584 --> 01:27:57.088]  There's this world revolution going on where totalitarianism was being fastened on one country after another.
[01:27:57.348 --> 01:28:00.190]  Millions of people were being slaughtered and tortured and imprisoned.
[01:28:00.890 --> 01:28:01.791]  So, Robert Welch,
[01:28:03.161 --> 01:28:05.962]  Was founded an organization.
[01:28:06.182 --> 01:28:23.766]  He named it after John Birch because he saw that Captain John Birch was an exemplary American who embodied everything that this country was great about this country and had been, as he said, was the first victim of World War Three.
[01:28:23.866 --> 01:28:32.388]  After World War Two, the big war for the world, communist totalitarianism, was underway and John Birch was the first victim.
[01:28:33.149 --> 01:28:38.837]  And by the way, the globalists, as you know, decades later now call that World War III.
[01:28:40.981 --> 01:28:46.770]  And so again, just so much that John Birch envisioned has actually become even mainline nomenclature in the technocracy.
[01:28:47.529 --> 01:28:48.309]  Yes.
[01:28:48.670 --> 01:29:08.599]  One of the things that Robert Welch recognized, and this is the reason why he and the John Birch Society were so demonized by the same mainstream media, the MSM-controlled corporate media, is that he was exposing the larger picture, and that is that
[01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:20.850]  Communism wasn't succeeding and all these millions of deaths were not just the result of the communists being so powerful and cunning and adept at taking over.
[01:29:20.870 --> 01:29:31.920]  They had indisputable, absolutely necessary help in the highest positions of power in some of the free world countries particularly.
[01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:32.801]  All right, stay there.
[01:29:32.821 --> 01:29:39.666]  I want to finish up with that and then leap forward to the grandchildren and sons and daughters of these globalists.
[01:29:40.067 --> 01:29:48.334]  What they're doing today, now they're out in the open, and what's currently happening and what you see happening in the future with William F. Jasper straight ahead of the New American Magazine.
[01:29:48.414 --> 01:29:49.194]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:29:50.936 --> 01:29:51.817]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.317 --> 01:29:53.918]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.938 --> 01:29:57.541]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:02.011 --> 01:30:13.337]  With health threats on the rise such as West Nile Virus, MRSA, CRE, and now the new bird flu recently discovered in China, there has never been a more crucial time to support your immune system.
[01:30:13.637 --> 01:30:26.525]  Supernatural Silver is a revolutionary new silver solution that is clinically shown to be several hundred times more effective than colloidal or ionic silver, and is powerful enough to help protect you and your family.
[01:30:26.845 --> 01:30:30.847]  Supernatural Silver is scientifically supported, highly effective,
[01:30:31.067 --> 01:30:34.409]  And perfect for everyday use inside the body as well as out.
[01:30:34.569 --> 01:30:36.190]  The Science Digest Journal says,
[01:31:01.347 --> 01:31:08.333]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even if I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[01:31:08.573 --> 01:31:26.207]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[01:31:26.468 --> 01:31:30.571]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[01:31:30.851 --> 01:31:32.412]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[01:31:32.612 --> 01:31:40.458]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.

[01:32:13.712 --> 01:32:17.115]  And up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.

[01:33:16.686 --> 01:33:18.727]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:33:18.787 --> 01:33:19.308]  Alright.
[01:33:37.518 --> 01:33:39.459]  All right, my friends, we are back live.
[01:33:39.539 --> 01:33:45.243]  William F. Jasper is our guest until five after next hour, and then I'll introduce Gerald Salente at eight after.
[01:33:45.283 --> 01:33:47.985]  He's going to guest host the broadcast today.
[01:33:48.005 --> 01:33:53.528]  Very excited to have Gerald Salente, one of our most popular guests and very informative gentleman, doing that.
[01:33:54.129 --> 01:33:56.931]  A bunch of things that are happening here.
[01:33:57.291 --> 01:34:03.315]  We can thank another station turning the show on, KSET 1300 AM in Beaumont, Texas.
[01:34:04.230 --> 01:34:06.451]  We're excited to have them joining the team.
[01:34:06.551 --> 01:34:14.655]  KSET 1300 AM will be airing the live weekday show starting in just a couple days on May 2nd.
[01:34:15.336 --> 01:34:16.196]  So I'll plug them then.
[01:34:16.776 --> 01:34:21.179]  And also we have a lot of stations that are now carrying the show twice a day.
[01:34:22.219 --> 01:34:25.941]  And also some stations going 24 hours a day like Jacksonville, Florida.
[01:34:26.341 --> 01:34:33.625]  As always, we want to thank all of those AM and FM affiliates out there for carrying the broadcast.
[01:34:34.245 --> 01:34:39.913]  Also, we're not funded by stimulus money or banker bailout money like General Electric funding MSNBC.
[01:34:40.674 --> 01:34:41.495]  We are 100% funded.
[01:34:42.035 --> 01:34:49.926]  We're not funded by the Koch brothers funding the kind of fake right wing either, which we were, because I'd take money and fund Liberty, period.
[01:34:51.247 --> 01:34:52.228]  There's no strings attached.
[01:34:52.268 --> 01:34:52.748]  Here, bring it.
[01:34:52.768 --> 01:34:53.128]  Give it to me.
[01:34:53.148 --> 01:34:54.389]  But I'm being sarcastic.
[01:34:54.649 --> 01:35:00.633]  The point here is we're funded by you buying books, videos, t-shirts, ball caps, clicking on our sponsors.
[01:35:01.373 --> 01:35:03.815]  We're funded by you spreading the word about the broadcast.
[01:35:03.835 --> 01:35:08.097]  We're funded by you supporting our local AM and FM stations, supporting those local sponsors.
[01:35:08.677 --> 01:35:13.921]  It really helps to let shops know you're coming in because they sponsor the show or if you're a business to become a sponsor.
[01:35:14.201 --> 01:35:15.682]  That's how we fund this operation.
[01:35:15.742 --> 01:35:16.862]  I'm hiring more reporters.
[01:35:17.323 --> 01:35:18.643]  I'm getting satellite feeds.
[01:35:18.843 --> 01:35:19.604]  You see what we're doing.
[01:35:19.864 --> 01:35:23.065]  A year ago, I cut that ad saying, we're going to the next level.
[01:35:23.505 --> 01:35:24.145]  I am going to go 110%.
[01:35:24.185 --> 01:35:27.346]  That's why I got black circles around my eyes.
[01:35:29.046 --> 01:35:35.647]  And I've been working 18 hours a day, many, many days, three, four days a week for the last year.
[01:35:36.348 --> 01:35:42.589]  And I have sworn on the altar of God, eternal resistance against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[01:35:43.249 --> 01:35:46.510]  And sometimes I do it in a ham-fisted way, but folks, pray for me.
[01:35:46.550 --> 01:35:47.330]  I'm doing the best I can.
[01:35:47.990 --> 01:35:51.151]  And, you know, God works in mysterious ways, so thanks for putting up with me.
[01:35:51.611 --> 01:35:53.271]  But I am your humble servant here in Liberty.
[01:35:53.631 --> 01:35:54.332]  I love my children.
[01:35:54.352 --> 01:35:55.092]  I want them to be free.
[01:35:55.132 --> 01:35:56.732]  I want them to live in a world with your children.
[01:35:56.992 --> 01:35:59.313]  And I want them to grow up and have grandchildren who have grandchildren.
[01:35:59.553 --> 01:36:03.614]  And we'll go to the stars together if we don't let the king rat scum take over.
[01:36:03.634 --> 01:36:06.635]  We're going back to Jasper here in a moment to give him the real floor.
[01:36:06.655 --> 01:36:12.236]  He's just breaking down amazing history here to understand what's brought us to this point, a snapshot of those that came before us.
[01:36:13.288 --> 01:36:13.468]  I don't
[01:36:30.669 --> 01:36:31.510]  We're good to go.
[01:36:58.153 --> 01:37:02.513]  And then also, please don't forget the new magazines arrive tomorrow.
[01:37:03.579 --> 01:37:06.501]  We have just sold out of the April issue.
[01:37:07.142 --> 01:37:10.785]  So the new magazines arrive tomorrow, 110,000 of them.
[01:37:11.245 --> 01:37:14.368]  Each magazine has three InfoWars.com stickers.
[01:37:14.808 --> 01:37:16.389]  One of them says, Save the Constitution.
[01:37:16.730 --> 01:37:18.131]  The other says InfoWars.com.
[01:37:18.151 --> 01:37:19.452]  The other says PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:37:19.852 --> 01:37:24.896]  The average bumper sticker gets seen by 20,000 people, they estimate, on some of the marketing sites I've read.
[01:37:24.916 --> 01:37:27.438]  20,000, at least if they're on a car.
[01:37:27.458 --> 01:37:29.600]  A little bit less if it's on a book bag or something else.
[01:37:29.620 --> 01:37:30.681]  The point is, 20,000 people.
[01:37:30.701 --> 01:37:31.522]  Let's say it's 1,000 people.
[01:37:33.143 --> 01:37:36.085]  The point is, this is an aggressive operation.
[01:37:36.125 --> 01:37:44.069]  Please get the new magazine, give it to friends and family, and then also put the bumper stickers on your own property, or give it to others to put on their own property.
[01:37:44.109 --> 01:37:45.830]  Please don't put it on anybody else's property.
[01:37:46.130 --> 01:37:47.611]  Though I'm sure provocateurs will do that.
[01:37:47.671 --> 01:37:48.532]  That's not our problem.
[01:37:49.272 --> 01:37:51.814]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, duty is ours.
[01:37:52.394 --> 01:37:53.895]  Consequences belong to God.
[01:37:53.915 --> 01:37:55.796]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:37:56.076 --> 01:37:59.178]  And don't forget, we've launched the new InfoWars Seed Center.
[01:38:00.038 --> 01:38:03.139]  And don't forget the New American Magazine also.
[01:38:03.499 --> 01:38:05.820]  Very important to support those Patriots as well.
[01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:07.761]  We'll tell you how to subscribe before Jasper leaves.
[01:38:08.101 --> 01:38:15.084]  Okay, we've got like 14 minutes left in this segment, then 5 minutes, then another 5 minutes, then we've got Gerald Cilente coming up at 8 after.
[01:38:15.144 --> 01:38:16.584]  But we've got William F. Jasper here.
[01:38:17.105 --> 01:38:19.906]  Finish up with, you had just gotten to the point
[01:38:21.179 --> 01:38:45.923]  of trying to basically put Mao in and then discovering that there were ultra-rich funding communism while using it as a dialectic to build a police state here, and then get into the current EU stuff you've been breaking and their own admissions, and then where you see us going, where you think the battle is, because I really respect your perspective as somebody who's been in this battle for 30 years, William F. Jasper.
[01:38:47.403 --> 01:38:48.423]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:38:48.524 --> 01:38:50.284]  Actually, it's almost 40 years now.
[01:38:50.664 --> 01:38:51.485]  Wow.
[01:38:51.505 --> 01:38:51.485]  37.
[01:38:51.825 --> 01:39:14.052]  So, well, we were talking at the end there, you know, huge, huge momentous shift in the whole planet following World War II with communism taking over much of Europe, much of Asia, including all of China.
[01:39:15.241 --> 01:39:25.866]  And that was happening at the same time that the United Nations was being founded, the incipient world government that was founded in 1945.
[01:39:25.926 --> 01:39:32.710]  Now, you and I were brought up in schools, I believe, until I went away to college.
[01:39:33.370 --> 01:39:34.591]  Actually, while I was in college.
[01:39:35.652 --> 01:39:38.115]  I became familiar with the John Birch Society.
[01:39:38.515 --> 01:39:50.871]  The United Nations was this glorious, wonderful, great big brotherhood of man that was founded at the end of World War II because the people of the world decided we couldn't have war anymore because of the atomic bomb.
[01:39:52.393 --> 01:40:01.418]  We had to find a way of getting past all our differences, so we'd all join hands and sing Kumbaya, and we'd join together at the United Nations, and we'd all live in peace, harmony, and brotherhood.
[01:40:02.858 --> 01:40:06.440]  At least that was the aspiration, or so we were told.
[01:40:07.541 --> 01:40:08.361]  Nothing of the kind.
[01:40:08.682 --> 01:40:19.247]  As I began looking into it, the first big disillusionment for me was J. Edward Griffin's book, The Fearful Master, A Second Look at the United Nations.
[01:40:19.307 --> 01:40:21.148]  You've had it on your program, I'm sure.
[01:40:22.489 --> 01:40:39.675]  But that just began a big transformation for me and understanding that really right from the very beginning we had two major forces working together hand-in-hand to use to build this United Nations into a world government which would be tyrannical.
[01:40:39.775 --> 01:40:44.797]  And the two hands that were joined together were first of all the Communists.
[01:40:45.758 --> 01:40:49.379]  Stalin's agent, Vesensky, was the main guy involved in
[01:40:49.599 --> 01:40:50.219]  We're good to go.
[01:41:14.042 --> 01:41:14.523]  I think?
[01:41:27.276 --> 01:41:27.516]  I think?
[01:41:45.248 --> 01:41:57.297]  He became head of the International Monetary Fund, and then he was followed by Virginius Frank Coe, another CFR member, member of the Communist Party, who finally left and went to live in China.
[01:41:58.858 --> 01:42:02.880]  But the International Monetary Fund is still with us, as is the United Nations.
[01:42:02.940 --> 01:42:26.332]  And in fact, the International Monetary Fund, this is one of the areas I've been writing extensively on for the last several years, is the big push by the Council on Foreign Relations and their other adjuncts around the world to transform the International Monetary Fund into a Federal Reserve of the world, to give it all of the powers that we now have in the Federal Reserve to control the monetary and fiscal policy of the world.
[01:42:27.292 --> 01:42:35.537]  And you wrote that something like 25 years ago, correct me if I'm wrong, and now it's mainstream news, but we're still kooks if we talk about it.
[01:42:36.677 --> 01:42:38.298]  I mean, it's just amazing.
[01:42:38.378 --> 01:42:47.443]  What is it like for you, I've got to ask this, to now see everything that Welch talked about 50 years ago actually come true exactly as he said?
[01:42:47.523 --> 01:42:50.925]  I mean, what incredible intelligence JBS had back then.
[01:42:51.165 --> 01:42:53.986]  I mean, I don't think it would have had any chance if it wasn't for you guys.
[01:42:54.066 --> 01:42:54.707]  I hate to sit here...
[01:42:55.787 --> 01:43:20.941]  I know, but for those that have been trying to inform the American people about this all along, only to be chastised as kooks and fear-mongers, etc., I mean, many other people, though, are beginning to see through that, because the Tea Party and every other conservative organization, religious organization, if you're opposed to any of the
[01:43:21.401 --> 01:43:41.313]  The agenda is to completely transform the United States to destroy all morality, destroy our economy, to force us into interdependence, to destroy our national sovereignty, and that's being stripped away from us right now as we see more and more of these
[01:43:41.953 --> 01:43:54.846]  United Nations treaties, the Law of the Sea, what they're trying to push through with the Global Arms Treaty, with all of the global environmental treaties and agreements.
[01:43:55.820 --> 01:44:07.563]  I was at the Earth Summit in 1992 and saw and reported on all of the things of Agenda 21, the Biodiversity Treaty and the global warming back then.
[01:44:08.083 --> 01:44:22.906]  And so it's frustrating to be years or decades ahead of where most people see the danger on the horizon.
[01:44:24.300 --> 01:44:35.443]  One of the other areas that we wrote about extensively, and I covered extensively over the years, and now it's becoming quite apparent, is the European Union.
[01:44:36.083 --> 01:44:44.985]  Our correspondent, Hilaire Duberrier, had been writing about that for 50 years, since the beginning of what was then the European Coal and Steel Community.
[01:44:45.025 --> 01:44:51.147]  And he had written about all of the people who were the socialists and one-worlders behind it, right from the start.
[01:44:51.887 --> 01:44:55.049]  And he was kind of a lone voice at that time.
[01:44:55.069 --> 01:44:58.211]  He was a very close colleague of mine.
[01:44:58.271 --> 01:45:00.973]  I regarded him as
[01:45:02.609 --> 01:45:15.474]  One of my teachers, and I got very close to him, and Hilaire Duberrier really wrote the whole book on the history of what we now know as the European Union.
[01:45:16.095 --> 01:45:23.918]  And this is very important because the European Union has destroyed the national sovereignty of its member states.
[01:45:24.518 --> 01:45:25.039]  We're good to go.
[01:45:42.919 --> 01:45:44.220]  Over and over again, publicly.
[01:45:44.781 --> 01:45:47.283]  This is not going to compromise our national sovereignty.
[01:45:47.323 --> 01:45:50.286]  This is not in any way going to overrule.
[01:45:50.306 --> 01:45:57.172]  We're not going to have a central bureaucracy that's going to ruin home rule, local rule.
[01:45:57.512 --> 01:46:00.815]  Now, as you pointed out earlier, now they come out, well, of course we have to.
[01:46:00.875 --> 01:46:05.959]  We can't have a federal state without giving up national sovereignty.
[01:46:06.300 --> 01:46:08.682]  And now they're trying to promote that.
[01:46:10.783 --> 01:46:22.509]  On a new level, with this transatlantic trade and investment partnership with the United States, which is now President Obama has asked for fast track authority to push through Congress.
[01:46:23.029 --> 01:46:29.493]  And so that's going to be one of the, that is one of the battles right before us now, because if they can push that through,
[01:46:30.986 --> 01:46:34.667]  Then again, we have no recourse.
[01:46:34.687 --> 01:46:50.192]  We'll follow down the same road that the nations of Europe have gone in having transnational courts, transnational legislatures, parliaments, etc., control every aspect of our lives.
[01:46:50.292 --> 01:46:53.213]  There will be no recourses that people of Europe are finding now.
[01:46:57.697 --> 01:47:00.618]  William, doesn't it come down to this?
[01:47:01.639 --> 01:47:07.962]  Doesn't it come down to the fact that big mega wealthy love monopolies as they openly talk about?
[01:47:08.262 --> 01:47:13.985]  Because then there's no competition and they just basically buy off the governments and then shut down their competition.
[01:47:14.545 --> 01:47:17.727]  And then on top of it, they're basically eugenicists who think there's too many people.
[01:47:17.747 --> 01:47:20.128]  So, you know, why not cut the resources off?
[01:47:20.168 --> 01:47:22.169]  I mean, what's at the bottom of the rabbit hole?
[01:47:22.269 --> 01:47:24.430]  If they get their world government, what are they going to set up?
[01:47:25.205 --> 01:47:35.028]  Well, I think we can have history, as Patrick Henry said, I have no lamp to guide my path except for the light of history.
[01:47:35.288 --> 01:47:39.530]  And we know that absolute power corrupts.
[01:47:40.110 --> 01:47:40.730]  Absolutely.
[01:47:41.010 --> 01:47:48.372]  And we've seen that in every communist, Nazi, fascist, dictatorship of any kind.
[01:47:48.653 --> 01:47:52.494]  And the fact that these folks who
[01:47:54.255 --> 01:48:02.862]  Are promoting this now happen to be so-called respectable bankers and presidents and secretaries of state and whatnot.
[01:48:04.043 --> 01:48:10.368]  Once they have total power, they are human beings that flows automatically and when we know.
[01:48:11.208 --> 01:48:17.252]  Their actual history, many of these people are certifiable megalomaniacs.
[01:48:17.392 --> 01:48:25.256]  They want to have total power, and no one who has total power and wants total power will use it beneficently.
[01:48:25.942 --> 01:48:26.322]  I agree.
[01:48:26.363 --> 01:48:27.804]  More and more we see an endgame.
[01:48:27.844 --> 01:48:34.089]  The billions of bullets, the armored vehicles, the army manuals saying, you know, that mainline Christian groups are bad.
[01:48:35.010 --> 01:48:38.012]  I mean, this is what you'd expect a weatherman to do if they were president.
[01:48:39.534 --> 01:48:44.918]  Do you agree with me that things are now moving at mock speed because they're behind on their timetable, as Brzezinski has said?
[01:48:44.958 --> 01:48:46.740]  Or where do you see the world right now?
[01:48:46.920 --> 01:48:53.766]  It's very clear that they have missed quite a number of very important datelines along the way.
[01:48:54.927 --> 01:48:59.171]  In terms of putting through, for instance, the Free Trade Area of the Americas.
[01:48:59.251 --> 01:49:03.594]  In terms of getting the Declaration of Interdependence.
[01:49:03.694 --> 01:49:09.339]  All of these things which we've published numerous times.
[01:49:09.559 --> 01:49:12.302]  The carbon tax four years ago when that got leaked.
[01:49:12.582 --> 01:49:14.604]  I mean, we're having victories when we engage them.
[01:49:15.140 --> 01:49:15.660]  Absolutely.
[01:49:15.740 --> 01:49:22.085]  And so there is a seeming frenetic activity going on.
[01:49:22.125 --> 01:49:24.867]  But you know, if you go back to one of the signal
[01:49:26.109 --> 01:49:27.069]  We're good to go.
[01:49:45.374 --> 01:49:53.919]  I mean, he's served on a number of... He wrote an article called The Hard Road to World Order, and it's one of the most important ones.
[01:49:53.979 --> 01:50:13.249]  There's many others like it, but one of the phrases that he used in there is he said, as this happens, as we begin forming this world government through regional arrangements on environment, on the economy, on security, etc., it will look like a booming, buzzing confusion.
[01:50:13.829 --> 01:50:15.630]  In other words, there's going to be all this activity.
[01:50:15.690 --> 01:50:18.531]  It's going to be hard for people to keep their eyes on it.
[01:50:18.571 --> 01:50:22.112]  But out of this confusion, they have a plan.
[01:50:22.132 --> 01:50:29.916]  It's going to create this new world order in which, through all these regional arrangements, the national sovereignties are destroyed.
[01:50:29.956 --> 01:50:37.679]  And first, the world order as it was of nation states is disaggregated.
[01:50:38.219 --> 01:50:43.201]  And then it is brought back together in this new aggregation of a new world order.
[01:50:43.701 --> 01:50:44.081]  That's right.
[01:51:01.775 --> 01:51:02.155]  The other side.
[01:51:02.175 --> 01:51:13.459]  With health threats on the rise such as West Nile virus, MRSA, CRE, and now the new bird flu recently discovered in China, there has never been a more crucial time to support your immune system.
[01:51:13.759 --> 01:51:26.643]  Supernatural Silver is a revolutionary new silver solution that is clinically shown to be several hundred times more effective than colloidal or ionic silver, and is powerful enough to help protect you and your family.
[01:51:26.983 --> 01:51:30.964]  Supernatural Silver is scientifically supported, highly effective,
[01:51:31.144 --> 01:51:31.845]  We're good to go.
[01:52:01.427 --> 01:52:06.448]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[01:53:01.244 --> 01:53:03.166]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[01:53:03.206 --> 01:53:05.448]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[01:53:05.588 --> 01:53:11.232]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[01:53:11.332 --> 01:53:14.795]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[01:53:15.055 --> 01:53:16.877]  You may think out of sight, out of mind,
[01:53:17.117 --> 01:53:18.758]  And so you don't think you will be affected.
[01:53:18.918 --> 01:53:20.099]  The fact is you are.
[01:53:20.299 --> 01:53:21.079]  We all are.
[01:53:21.319 --> 01:53:23.661]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[01:53:23.961 --> 01:53:32.245]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoods Direct.

[01:53:51.959 --> 01:53:58.184]  Again, that number is 800-409-5633 or on the web at efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:53:58.424 --> 01:54:00.266]  You can bet your life on eFoods Direct.
[01:54:02.325 --> 01:54:18.920]  Okay, if you go to DrugsReport.com, there's a daily mail article about Misha, the supposed redhead guy that nobody can find for a week.
[01:54:28.129 --> 01:54:36.176]  Uh, who reportedly said it was all Alex Jones' fault that the guys basically did what they did, and that no one could say who actually talked to him in the Associated Press.
[01:54:36.796 --> 01:54:45.464]  And Kurt Nemo put an article out today at Infowars.com saying nobody can find him, uh, and saying, you know, this looks like a perfect cutout to make this up and demonize the internet.
[01:54:46.025 --> 01:54:48.847]  Well, sure enough, the Daily Mail did find him in Rhode Island.
[01:54:49.790 --> 01:54:58.111]  I want to send Dan Bodondi over there to interview him and so this just confirms Kurt's article that it's basically just made up because he says it's made up and he didn't say those things.
[01:54:58.351 --> 01:55:03.772]  When you get that added to Kurt's article, Misha the Radicalizer's story hits a speed bump.
[01:55:04.413 --> 01:55:12.734]  The emerging narrative on the Boston bombing and the role allegedly played by the now deceased Tamerlan hinges on a shadowy figure the government calls Misha.
[01:55:13.114 --> 01:55:18.055]  It said the red bearded Muslim lives in the Boston area but could not be located by authorities or the corporate media.
[01:55:18.795 --> 01:55:19.395]  He's been found.
[01:55:19.435 --> 01:55:19.976]  DailyMail.
[01:55:19.996 --> 01:55:20.936]  DrudgeReport.com.
[01:55:21.176 --> 01:55:21.796]  Right-hand side.
[01:55:21.816 --> 01:55:23.077]  We need to add that to this article.
[01:55:23.617 --> 01:55:25.678]  And it just adds to what Kurt was saying.
[01:55:25.698 --> 01:55:26.758]  So, there you go.
[01:55:26.778 --> 01:55:28.119]  That story's been on Drudge since this morning.
[01:55:28.599 --> 01:55:35.742]  Okay, going back to our guest in this little segment, the next, and Gerald Cilente is coming in.
[01:55:38.362 --> 01:55:42.924]  Well, one of the very important ones where we see this convergence going on, this is a very important term.
[01:55:54.811 --> 01:56:09.748]  I'm sure many of your listeners are familiar with, but they should be more and more familiar with, is convergence, where this was the plan after World War II was first to build up the communist countries, the Hegelian dialectic, where they would be a credible force against the free world.
[01:56:10.308 --> 01:56:13.772]  And then to have a, well, we can't have this constant
[01:56:15.326 --> 01:56:20.650]  threat of nuclear war, we're going to have to have some kind of convergence where we'll all come together.
[01:56:20.710 --> 01:56:27.735]  Well, we couldn't do that with communism being on what Lenin called war communism, antagonistic.
[01:56:28.255 --> 01:56:30.597]  So we had to have peace communism.
[01:56:30.637 --> 01:56:33.359]  And so that's what's happened over the last 20 years.
[01:56:33.419 --> 01:56:35.940]  Supposedly communism has collapsed.
[01:56:36.041 --> 01:56:42.005]  Now we can merge, converge peacefully with the communist countries, with China, Russia, etc.
[01:56:43.085 --> 01:56:47.526]  I've been at a number of the big convergence conferences.
[01:56:47.606 --> 01:56:54.508]  One of the big venues for this is Gorbachev's State of the World Forum, which I've been at virtually all of them.
[01:56:55.048 --> 01:57:01.890]  One of the big ones was in San Francisco in 1995, the 50th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations in San Francisco.
[01:57:02.410 --> 01:57:09.072]  Gorbachev was there, had Ted Turner, Zbigniew Brzezinski, all of the big names from around the world there.
[01:57:09.552 --> 01:57:14.853]  And Zbigniew Brzezinski made his speech, which I reported on from there, and we recorded it.
[01:57:15.573 --> 01:57:21.355]  That's where he made his famous statement that we cannot leap into world government in one step.
[01:57:21.775 --> 01:57:29.237]  It has to occur through gradual, step-by-step regional developments.
[01:57:29.957 --> 01:57:50.431]  And this, of course, is a restatement of what a number of other key One World, New World Order architects have stated, which we've reported on, which is that we have to have these regional arrangements which destroy the national sovereignty by linking country to country and region to region.
[01:57:50.911 --> 01:57:58.436]  And that's what we see happening through many of the different economic, security, military
[01:57:59.156 --> 01:57:59.817]  We're good to go.
[01:58:25.779 --> 01:58:34.047]  But they all cede authority to unelected corporate boards who can even exempt themselves from taxes and give themselves government contracts and too big to fill money.
[01:58:34.108 --> 01:58:34.788]  It is incredible.
[01:58:35.129 --> 01:58:39.653]  Five more minutes with William F. Jasper from the New American Magazine, then Gerald Celente, host.
[01:58:42.036 --> 01:58:43.877]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.619 --> 01:58:47.781]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.454 --> 01:58:54.197]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[01:58:54.477 --> 01:58:59.322]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:58:59.502 --> 01:59:06.669]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[01:59:06.809 --> 01:59:12.213]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[01:59:12.433 --> 01:59:16.176]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[01:59:16.476 --> 01:59:21.000]  We've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[01:59:21.200 --> 01:59:26.404]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[01:59:26.624 --> 01:59:29.725]  Strategic Relocation 3rd Edition by Joel Skousen.
[01:59:29.885 --> 01:59:32.125]  When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.
[01:59:32.385 --> 01:59:36.966]  Therosafe used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[01:59:37.126 --> 01:59:39.587]  Hand-cranked shortwave AM FM radios.
[01:59:40.027 --> 01:59:47.068]  Everything that we've researched and found to be the best is available at Infowarshop.com and your purchase makes our Infowar possible.
[01:59:47.228 --> 01:59:48.268]  We're getting prepared.
[01:59:48.508 --> 01:59:48.929]  Are you?
[01:59:49.169 --> 01:59:50.009]  Infowarshop.com
[01:59:54.355 --> 01:59:56.296]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.756 --> 01:59:59.617]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:06.159 --> 02:00:06.819]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.459 --> 02:00:08.519]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:09.240 --> 02:00:10.380]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.400 --> 02:00:11.821]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.581 --> 02:00:14.081]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.121 --> 02:00:17.802]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.303 --> 02:00:22.384]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:28.447 --> 02:00:31.288]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the final segment I'm going to be hosting.
[02:00:31.308 --> 02:00:36.349]  I'm going to bring you in with Gerald Cilente in the next segment and introduce him for stations that join us.
[02:00:36.789 --> 02:00:39.370]  Most stations carry all three hours, but some only carry the third hour.
[02:00:40.210 --> 02:00:41.671]  Right now, William F. Jasper joins us.
[02:00:41.691 --> 02:00:44.372]  Hey, just briefly before you finish your points, this is only a five-minute segment.
[02:00:44.792 --> 02:00:46.772]  How do people subscribe to the New American Magazine?
[02:00:46.792 --> 02:00:52.814]  Because even if you think you know everything about this, you will learn a lot there every month, and it's meticulously researched.
[02:00:53.635 --> 02:00:58.646]  Uh, and at the same time, uh, people can then pay it forward, hand it off to other people.
[02:00:58.706 --> 02:01:03.015]  I mean, that's, uh, I cannot understand, you know, uh, overstate.
[02:01:04.778 --> 02:01:09.021]  Anything I say is an understatement of the entire movement against the globalists.
[02:01:09.041 --> 02:01:17.326]  The original battle prospectus breakdown on their plan is from Mr. Welsh and you over the last 37 years and others.
[02:01:17.966 --> 02:01:24.331]  Mr. McManus, I mean, it's such a small group too and absolutely demonized, but knowing you're right,
[02:01:25.371 --> 02:01:31.317]  And they're probably 10 to 15 years behind their own documents, so God bless you.
[02:01:31.738 --> 02:01:34.561]  I salute everybody that's been fighting the globalists.
[02:01:34.621 --> 02:01:36.963]  Jim Tucker, American Free Press, just died.
[02:01:37.003 --> 02:01:37.964]  He helped fight them as well.
[02:01:40.146 --> 02:01:41.347]  Where do you see the future going?
[02:02:02.037 --> 02:02:08.786]  Both the print magazine, which you mentioned, and it's actually bi-weekly, and so 25 issues a year.
[02:02:08.826 --> 02:02:10.268]  We take a break one week, so it's 25 issues.
[02:02:10.288 --> 02:02:14.293]  It's $39 for the print, or you get $49, you get the print, and you can get it via email and PDF form as well.
[02:02:21.561 --> 02:02:25.445]  And there's a lot of exclusive stuff in the print magazine.
[02:02:26.066 --> 02:02:36.817]  While many of the major print magazines have folded or gone under in major newspapers, we're still holding in there doing the actual hard copy print magazine.
[02:02:36.857 --> 02:02:40.200]  Please don't stop because people really pay attention to hard copy.
[02:02:40.540 --> 02:02:41.642]  People really pay attention.
[02:02:42.902 --> 02:02:54.868]  I have to stress also that the online edition, we have 10 to 15 new articles a day that are going to be appearing in the print magazine.
[02:02:54.948 --> 02:03:01.851]  So there's some material that we include in both, but there's exclusive material online and in print.
[02:03:02.331 --> 02:03:05.372]  And now I see you guys linked up on the Drudge Report.
[02:03:05.412 --> 02:03:06.593]  The New World Order's got to hate that.
[02:03:07.313 --> 02:03:24.626]  Yes, well, this is one of the encouraging things, Alex, and that is that as it gets later and later in the game, as the lines begin to be drawn here and people see, hey, wait a second, we're losing freedom every step of the way here.
[02:03:26.187 --> 02:03:28.008]  Let's find out about it.
[02:03:28.028 --> 02:03:29.449]  More and more people are waking up.
[02:03:29.849 --> 02:03:37.315]  The big question is, are we going to wake up enough people in enough time and get us all shooting in the right direction?
[02:03:38.355 --> 02:03:39.196]  Figuratively, of course.
[02:03:40.457 --> 02:03:42.939]  But I think we're going to win if everybody takes action.
[02:03:43.439 --> 02:03:45.721]  I really see us more and more gaining ground.
[02:03:46.201 --> 02:03:58.588]  Well, one of the things you mentioned is that there's so much happening, they're speeding up this whole thing on a lot of different levels, and that is true, and I see part of it as desperation.
[02:03:58.628 --> 02:03:58.888]  They are.
[02:03:59.749 --> 02:04:01.930]  In fact, we've published a number of things showing that
[02:04:02.831 --> 02:04:15.663]  Many of the people that are pushing this in Congress, but also in the think tanks, the places like the Council on Foreign Relations and whatnot, they are saying amongst themselves, hey, we can't let the crazy people out there know what's going on.
[02:04:15.983 --> 02:04:17.345]  We can't let the American people know.
[02:04:17.405 --> 02:04:20.468]  They'll all go berserk over this.
[02:04:21.288 --> 02:04:40.501]  And so at venues like the World Economic Forum and other high globalist meeting places like this, they are acknowledging that, hey, we've got to step things up here, we've got to be more deceptive, we've got to undermine opposition within the political party.
[02:04:40.521 --> 02:04:42.922]  And that's what they're doing, and it's only backfiring.
[02:04:42.942 --> 02:04:45.064]  William F. Jasper, thanks for spending an hour with us.
[02:04:45.084 --> 02:04:48.986]  I look forward to having you and other folks that you recommend on the broadcast.
[02:04:49.006 --> 02:04:49.466]  Thank you, sir.
[02:04:49.727 --> 02:04:50.067]  Thank you.
[02:04:51.147 --> 02:04:56.915]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, the man, Gerald Salente, directly from Kingston, New York, is coming up.
[02:04:57.115 --> 02:04:58.898]  Straight ahead, he'll be hosting the broadcast.

[02:06:05.317 --> 02:06:10.762]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[02:06:11.363 --> 02:06:14.566]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?

[02:07:01.503 --> 02:07:03.424]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[02:07:03.444 --> 02:07:05.405]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[02:07:05.625 --> 02:07:11.127]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[02:07:11.327 --> 02:07:15.108]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[02:07:15.369 --> 02:07:19.130]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[02:07:19.310 --> 02:07:20.491]  The fact is, you are.
[02:07:20.691 --> 02:07:21.471]  We all are.
[02:07:21.711 --> 02:07:24.052]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[02:07:24.352 --> 02:07:32.714]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoodsDirect.
[02:07:32.914 --> 02:07:34.115]  Be prepared before you need it.
[02:07:34.295 --> 02:07:37.476]  With nutrient-dense food you can store for up to 25 years.
[02:07:37.776 --> 02:07:40.036]  You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed you.
[02:07:40.156 --> 02:07:44.577]  Do what I've done and get your own supply of the best storable foods out there from eFoodsDirect.
[02:07:44.717 --> 02:07:50.599]  Call 800-409-5633 or visit them on the web at eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:07:50.859 --> 02:07:52.280]  And check out their spring specials.
[02:07:52.500 --> 02:07:58.785]  Again, that number is 800-409-5633 or on the web at efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:07:59.025 --> 02:08:00.987]  You can bet your life on eFoods Direct.
[02:08:05.330 --> 02:08:06.851]  We are on the march.
[02:08:07.212 --> 02:08:09.634]  The empire is on the run.
[02:08:10.374 --> 02:08:14.077]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:19.417 --> 02:08:28.790]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I'm coming to you from Hot Springs, Arkansas, spending a few days with the family, but also hosting part of the broadcast with Jakari Jackson, David Niner, our guest.
[02:08:29.511 --> 02:08:33.336]  But in the next 52 minutes, you're going to have the real treat of Gerald Salente.
[02:08:34.537 --> 02:08:43.343]  Taking over the broadcast and covering a host of issues in the last minute or so, Jakari Jackson will end the transmission until tonight's InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:08:43.383 --> 02:08:55.231]  But out the window, if you're watching on PrisonPlanet.tv, the nightly news, you can see the Army-Navy Rehabilitation Center, part of which is still open here with the volcanic hot water baths.
[02:08:55.291 --> 02:08:57.693]  This town is basically rotting back into the hills.
[02:08:58.374 --> 02:09:00.075]  Once a vibrant place, but it's still one of the
[02:09:00.655 --> 02:09:01.916]  Best places in America to visit.
[02:09:02.276 --> 02:09:04.698]  So we can keep Hot Springs, Arkansas alive.
[02:09:04.718 --> 02:09:10.982]  I've been coming here since I was a small child, and I'm here with family now for a few days, but we're coming back to Austin today, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:09:11.742 --> 02:09:18.887]  But again, I am here in Hot Springs, Arkansas, and there is a shot via Skype out the window of that.
[02:09:18.927 --> 02:09:22.510]  I'm going to turn things over to Gerald Salente of TheTrendsJournal.com.
[02:09:22.850 --> 02:09:27.713]  He's going to be covering Syria, White House Correspondents Dinner, Bush Library, Italian government.
[02:09:28.394 --> 02:09:30.335]  He's also going to get into the Boston bombing, China.
[02:09:30.775 --> 02:09:33.577]  And positive measures should return prosperity to America.
[02:09:33.898 --> 02:09:40.102]  So we turn the InfoWars worldwide broadcast over to the top trends forecaster, Gerald Cilente.
[02:09:40.422 --> 02:09:42.884]  Gerald, again, my friend, I want to thank you for joining us.
[02:09:43.565 --> 02:09:45.967]  And the helm, the comm, is now yours, Captain.
[02:09:46.627 --> 02:09:47.808]  Well, thank you so much.
[02:09:47.868 --> 02:09:50.510]  It's a real honor for me to be here today, Alex.
[02:09:51.030 --> 02:09:57.194]  And what I like to do during this segment is really what we do every day on Trends in the News.
[02:09:57.294 --> 02:10:02.317]  It's part of the subscription to the Trends Journal, and they're nightly broadcasts.
[02:10:02.357 --> 02:10:08.781]  Of course, they're not as long as the one I'm going to do now, but they average anywhere between 15 to 20 minutes.
[02:10:10.282 --> 02:10:14.005]  So let's start off with today's trends in the news.
[02:10:14.705 --> 02:10:22.051]  And the first one, one of the ones you just mentioned, is that White House correspondents dinner.
[02:10:22.511 --> 02:10:28.436]  You know, I was just listening to William Jasper of New American magazine.
[02:10:29.016 --> 02:10:33.657]  And you, Alex, saying that, yes, we can change this.
[02:10:34.297 --> 02:10:35.778]  It can be changed.
[02:10:36.138 --> 02:10:38.618]  We don't have to go down this course.
[02:10:39.078 --> 02:10:48.360]  And if you don't believe me, look at the White House Correspondents Dinner and how lame it is.
[02:10:48.781 --> 02:10:52.701]  And you think you're in a high school assembly.
[02:10:52.981 --> 02:10:54.922]  Just listen to some of this stuff.
[02:10:57.082 --> 02:10:59.303]  I recognize that this job can take a toll on you.
[02:11:00.263 --> 02:11:10.425]  I understand, second term, need a burst of new energy, try some new things, and then my team and I talked about it, we were willing to try anything, so we borrowed one of Michelle's tricks.
[02:11:16.966 --> 02:11:19.287]  Listen to the prostitutes!
[02:11:23.663 --> 02:11:24.243]  That's enough.
[02:11:24.724 --> 02:11:25.344]  That's enough.
[02:11:26.065 --> 02:11:28.106]  Then you hear Conan O'Brien.
[02:11:28.347 --> 02:11:32.510]  You listen to the prostitutes clap on cue.
[02:11:33.050 --> 02:11:34.511]  It's disgusting.
[02:11:35.072 --> 02:11:39.575]  And what's more disgusting is how anybody could look up to this stuff.
[02:11:39.976 --> 02:11:42.397]  And you look at all the media that came out.
[02:11:42.578 --> 02:11:46.140]  Oh, Obama hit him with a one-two punch.
[02:11:46.601 --> 02:11:48.422]  Oh, Conan was fabulous.
[02:11:48.862 --> 02:11:51.805]  The guys are reading like this from their notes.
[02:11:52.225 --> 02:11:55.407]  And all the prostitutes laugh.
[02:11:56.107 --> 02:12:02.210]  It's a disgraceful spectacle of human beings acting at the lowest level.
[02:12:02.530 --> 02:12:06.392]  So you take this information, and this is what you're fighting.
[02:12:06.872 --> 02:12:08.513]  This is what you're up against.
[02:12:08.753 --> 02:12:10.134]  You're up against nothing.
[02:12:10.454 --> 02:12:12.055]  You've heard me say this before.
[02:12:12.375 --> 02:12:13.276]  I'll say it again.
[02:12:14.096 --> 02:12:24.389]  All these politicians are, are the same people you couldn't stand in high school and college that wanted to be class president and head of the student council.
[02:12:24.710 --> 02:12:30.758]  The suck-ups, the brown noses, the glad handers, the overly ambitious and the insincere.
[02:12:31.158 --> 02:12:32.459]  And who are the prostitutes?
[02:12:32.839 --> 02:12:38.121]  The same clowns that were the journalists that ran the school newspapers.
[02:12:38.461 --> 02:12:45.484]  It's like they're talking to the principal of the school or the president of the college when they interview the president.
[02:12:45.824 --> 02:12:52.287]  So when I listen to Mr. Jasper, when I listen to Alex Jones, the future is ours!
[02:12:53.263 --> 02:12:55.726]  Unless you think they're better than you are.
[02:12:56.387 --> 02:12:58.049]  So to me, it's very hopeful.
[02:12:58.329 --> 02:13:02.555]  You look at these clown acts, amateur hour for what it is.
[02:13:03.776 --> 02:13:04.637]  Let's move on.
[02:13:04.757 --> 02:13:05.178]  Gold.
[02:13:06.960 --> 02:13:08.882]  Gold prices are up a little bit today.
[02:13:10.387 --> 02:13:14.150]  And they were up about 12% since when they bottomed out a few weeks ago.
[02:13:15.071 --> 02:13:18.414]  And I've said this before for those of you who haven't heard it before.
[02:13:18.955 --> 02:13:21.557]  My first buy of gold was in 1978 at $187.50 an ounce.
[02:13:21.617 --> 02:13:23.739]  I also bought gold on January 20th, 1980 at the high during the day at $8.75.
[02:13:23.799 --> 02:13:24.059]  It closed at $8.50.
[02:13:37.030 --> 02:13:41.511]  I remember what it felt like back then when the market was diving.
[02:13:42.051 --> 02:13:44.252]  Very different sentiment now.
[02:13:44.632 --> 02:13:46.152]  Back then there was no Russia.
[02:13:46.832 --> 02:13:48.513]  Back then there was no China.
[02:13:49.153 --> 02:13:51.033]  Russia was a Soviet Union.
[02:13:51.413 --> 02:13:54.634]  Everything east of Berlin was locked behind the Iron Curtain.
[02:13:54.954 --> 02:13:58.415]  The only thing people knew back then about China was Mao.
[02:13:59.455 --> 02:13:59.915]  India?
[02:14:00.815 --> 02:14:02.176]  They do nothing about India.
[02:14:02.656 --> 02:14:04.656]  It's a global world now.
[02:14:05.156 --> 02:14:18.540]  You're seeing the people rushing in to buy gold as the prices are dropping because everyone knows that you cannot keep juicing the economy by printing more money.
[02:14:19.580 --> 02:14:21.261]  So look at the news today.
[02:14:21.281 --> 02:14:26.582]  Oh, on May 2nd, they're going to meet over there in the European Central Bank.
[02:14:27.625 --> 02:14:29.566]  And they're going to be lowering interest rates.
[02:14:29.826 --> 02:14:34.447]  That's the word coming out from the experts.
[02:14:35.467 --> 02:14:37.348]  And then you look what's going on.
[02:14:38.068 --> 02:14:41.489]  Why is the market even going up a little bit today?
[02:14:42.269 --> 02:14:43.850]  Read the information.
[02:14:44.290 --> 02:14:45.490]  They'll tell you why.
[02:14:45.510 --> 02:14:47.651]  It's Bloomberg.
[02:14:48.763 --> 02:15:04.591]  There's just a positive tone to the market, in part because recent lackluster economic trends have reinforced investors' belief that the Federal Reserve will continue to press on the gas pedal.
[02:15:04.611 --> 02:15:08.513]  And that's from Chad Morganlander.
[02:15:09.611 --> 02:15:13.472]  And his firm, they oversee $130 billion.
[02:15:13.712 --> 02:15:16.093]  Gas on the pedal!
[02:15:16.113 --> 02:15:18.353]  You know what kind of language that is?
[02:15:18.713 --> 02:15:28.516]  I can't say this on this show, but the first letter is B, and the second letter is S, in saying the two words, because that's what that is.
[02:15:29.136 --> 02:15:30.177]  Gas to the pedal?
[02:15:30.597 --> 02:15:30.977]  No!
[02:15:31.377 --> 02:15:37.521]  It's pumping more worthless money into the economy and devaluing the currency.
[02:15:37.861 --> 02:15:43.845]  And it's going on globally, and that's why I believe in gold.
[02:15:45.120 --> 02:15:46.881]  Let's look at some of the headlines.
[02:15:47.342 --> 02:16:06.517]  This is from the New York Times, the self-proclaimed paper of record, of which I like to call it the toilet paper of record, considering the wonderful job they've done to take us to war for fake reasons and to keep propping up the lies and keeping the propaganda going.
[02:16:07.554 --> 02:16:08.515]  This is a great one.
[02:16:08.895 --> 02:16:13.700]  Karzai's office gets bags full of cash from the CIA.
[02:16:14.480 --> 02:16:17.823]  A decade of paying for Afghan influence.
[02:16:18.544 --> 02:16:19.665]  Can you imagine that?
[02:16:20.065 --> 02:16:21.166]  Don't have a job?
[02:16:21.226 --> 02:16:22.588]  The one you have stinks?
[02:16:23.148 --> 02:16:24.409]  Can't pay your mortgage?
[02:16:24.489 --> 02:16:25.730]  Don't have any rent money?
[02:16:26.491 --> 02:16:27.772]  Can't make ends meet.
[02:16:28.112 --> 02:16:29.334]  Don't worry about it.
[02:16:29.714 --> 02:16:32.036]  It's all outlined here.
[02:16:32.616 --> 02:16:40.403]  We call it ghost money, said Khalil Roman, who served as Mr. Karzai's chief of staff from 2002 to 2005.
[02:16:43.906 --> 02:16:46.807]  It came in secret and left in secret.
[02:16:47.347 --> 02:16:50.048]  All told, tens of millions of dollars.
[02:16:50.468 --> 02:16:53.089]  And it goes on and on and on.
[02:16:53.489 --> 02:16:56.490]  How this scam, the CIA's money?
[02:16:57.230 --> 02:16:58.291]  It's your money.
[02:16:58.671 --> 02:17:00.231]  Hey, cities are rotting.
[02:17:00.632 --> 02:17:03.693]  Alex is talking about how run-down Little Rock looks.
[02:17:04.073 --> 02:17:05.233]  Don't worry about it.
[02:17:05.613 --> 02:17:10.415]  We gotta send the money over there to the criminal group so that they could wash it.
[02:17:11.275 --> 02:17:12.938]  And keep the wars going.
[02:17:13.479 --> 02:17:18.067]  You read the quotes in this paper, it is astounding the things they say.
[02:17:18.956 --> 02:17:19.196]  Yeah.
[02:17:19.857 --> 02:17:22.978]  CIA's money goes to paying off warlords.
[02:17:23.399 --> 02:17:25.000]  Nothing like a warlord!
[02:17:25.340 --> 02:17:26.300]  Oh, they're wonderful.
[02:17:26.601 --> 02:17:28.922]  You need a good warlord in your community.
[02:17:29.642 --> 02:17:36.526]  And politicians, many of whom have ties to the drug trade, and in some cases the Taliban!
[02:17:36.826 --> 02:17:37.547]  Yeah, wonderful!
[02:17:37.927 --> 02:17:40.108]  Go back to the Correspondents' Dinner.
[02:17:40.529 --> 02:17:42.070]  Look who's running this country.
[02:17:42.530 --> 02:17:44.331]  Look who's making these decisions.
[02:17:44.671 --> 02:17:50.373]  If you were right to do anything like this so stupid in our jobs, we would be fired.
[02:17:50.793 --> 02:17:54.255]  But it's okay when the government does it.
[02:17:54.855 --> 02:17:56.976]  The headlines here are astounding.
[02:17:57.316 --> 02:18:02.038]  The cash does not appear to be subject to oversight and restrictions.
[02:18:02.578 --> 02:18:03.038]  No!
[02:18:03.238 --> 02:18:04.499]  Hey, it's their money!
[02:18:04.799 --> 02:18:06.080]  The CIA's money!
[02:18:06.120 --> 02:18:07.080]  Where did they get it?
[02:18:07.320 --> 02:18:08.521]  They got it from you!
[02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.201]  This is where your tax dollars are going.
[02:18:12.641 --> 02:18:14.663]  No more foreign intervention.
[02:18:15.023 --> 02:18:17.624]  Everything they do, that's a loser!
[02:18:17.964 --> 02:18:27.169]  And you can't see a bigger loser than right over here on the front page of the toilet paper of record.
[02:18:28.590 --> 02:18:34.853]  So, that's where it's all going, that's where it's heading, and it doesn't look very good.
[02:18:36.174 --> 02:18:37.635]  Yeah, these quotes are brilliant.
[02:18:39.813 --> 02:18:43.314]  Much of it also goes to keeping old warlords in line.
[02:18:43.735 --> 02:18:44.875]  Check this line out.
[02:18:45.215 --> 02:18:48.957]  This is from an old warlord, Mr. Dostrum.
[02:18:49.757 --> 02:18:54.319]  I asked for a year up front in cash so I could build my dream house.
[02:18:54.719 --> 02:19:02.202]  He was quoted as saying in a 2009 interview in Time Magazine.
[02:19:02.702 --> 02:19:03.403]  That's right.
[02:19:03.803 --> 02:19:05.624]  He gets his $100,000 up front, piles it up,
[02:19:09.125 --> 02:19:11.707]  So he could build a home of his choice.
[02:19:12.228 --> 02:19:20.474]  So this is what we do on Trends in the News, because as we're talking about foreign affairs, here's another wonderful little story.
[02:19:20.995 --> 02:19:24.878]  Republicans warn of inaction on Syria.
[02:19:25.598 --> 02:19:26.359]  Oh, yeah.
[02:19:26.859 --> 02:19:27.960]  That guy again.
[02:19:28.441 --> 02:19:29.682]  That little chicken hawk.
[02:19:30.022 --> 02:19:30.502]  You know.
[02:19:30.522 --> 02:19:33.345]  Lindsey Graham.
[02:19:34.065 --> 02:19:34.365]  Yeah.
[02:19:35.592 --> 02:19:37.375]  Calling for more war.
[02:19:38.377 --> 02:19:41.062]  More war in Syria.
[02:19:41.422 --> 02:19:43.065]  Messed up in Afghanistan.
[02:19:43.466 --> 02:19:44.488]  Iraq's a bust.
[02:19:45.149 --> 02:19:46.552]  Libya down the tubes.
[02:19:46.972 --> 02:19:48.635]  Let's go into Syria.
[02:20:01.613 --> 02:20:03.555]  Hey there, my name is Frank Bates.
[02:20:04.016 --> 02:20:06.719]  Do you know the number one most valuable item in a crisis?
[02:20:07.300 --> 02:20:12.926]  Some people think the answer is gold, others think it's a gun, but the correct answer will shock you.
[02:20:13.467 --> 02:20:21.276]  I just created a free video at Crisis123.com that reveals a surprising item that is more valuable than gold in a crisis.
[02:20:22.318 --> 02:20:25.381]  97% of Americans don't have this one critical item.
[02:20:25.661 --> 02:20:27.503]  In fact, they haven't even given it a thought.
[02:20:27.823 --> 02:20:34.810]  And the sad truth is that you may not survive without it when a real crisis hits and a starving mob is right outside your door.
[02:20:35.311 --> 02:20:39.796]  What I have to tell you could literally make the difference between life and death for you and your family.
[02:20:40.296 --> 02:20:46.203]  Watch my video at Crisis123.com to discover the number one most valuable item in a crisis.
[02:20:46.523 --> 02:20:47.304]  You'll be shocked.
[02:20:47.885 --> 02:20:52.590]  See the controversial video that thousands of other smart patrons have already seen in the last three months.
[02:20:53.091 --> 02:20:58.156]  Go watch my video now at Crisis123.com before they force me to shut it down.
[02:20:58.577 --> 02:20:59.938]  Again, that's Crisis123.com.
[02:21:01.600 --> 02:21:02.460]  Start life over.
[02:21:02.841 --> 02:21:04.681]  Spend more quality time with your family.
[02:21:04.901 --> 02:21:06.002]  Take more vacations.
[02:21:06.382 --> 02:21:07.362]  Own your own business.
[02:21:07.702 --> 02:21:11.004]  Be healthy and earn the kind of income you've always dreamed of.
[02:21:11.404 --> 02:21:12.104]  Is it possible?
[02:21:12.484 --> 02:21:13.985]  Yes, with Young-Jevity.

[02:22:31.956 --> 02:22:36.339]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:22:36.519 --> 02:22:42.243]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:22:42.343 --> 02:22:45.745]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[02:23:44.664 --> 02:23:45.844]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:24:16.257 --> 02:24:21.679]  Hi, this is Gerald Cilenti, hosting on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:21.719 --> 02:24:22.899]  An honor to be here.
[02:24:23.580 --> 02:24:28.482]  As I was talking about Syria when we went into the break, don't worry about it.
[02:24:29.122 --> 02:24:35.284]  The New York Times just reported, hey, them Islamists are taking over there in Syria.
[02:24:35.664 --> 02:24:36.725]  That's OK.
[02:24:37.105 --> 02:24:38.345]  They're everywhere.
[02:24:39.005 --> 02:24:41.827]  And you know who built the Islamist group, don't you?
[02:24:42.387 --> 02:24:44.147]  That was Jimmy Carter.
[02:24:44.167 --> 02:24:44.247]  Yeah.
[02:24:45.908 --> 02:25:02.388]  You remember the proxy war that the United States started giving money to people like Osama Bin Laden and all the rest of them to fight the Russians when they were going into Afghanistan to stop the Russians?
[02:25:02.528 --> 02:25:02.828]  Yeah!
[02:25:03.752 --> 02:25:04.933]  Those Islamists.
[02:25:05.374 --> 02:25:07.497]  So now they want more money.
[02:25:08.197 --> 02:25:10.140]  They want more intervention.
[02:25:10.240 --> 02:25:21.453]  People like Lindsey Graham calling for more action in Syria because it appears they're all suffering from attention deficit disorder.
[02:25:22.697 --> 02:25:30.100]  Classes, clashes carry worries of a new civil war in Iraq.
[02:25:30.560 --> 02:25:34.222]  That's right, a new civil war in Iraq.
[02:25:34.682 --> 02:25:36.343]  That's the word coming out.
[02:25:37.418 --> 02:25:40.099]  But hey, why believe me?
[02:25:40.659 --> 02:25:41.699]  Look at the papers.
[02:25:42.459 --> 02:25:45.640]  Oh, 11 dead in another car bomb in Iraq.
[02:25:46.280 --> 02:25:47.241]  Wonderful!
[02:25:47.941 --> 02:25:56.423]  Yeah, but listen to what happened over when President Bush announced the opening of his new library.
[02:25:56.983 --> 02:26:03.788]  You know, President Obama said that he's drawing a red line that Syria can't cross.
[02:26:04.408 --> 02:26:09.471]  I wonder if he got the crayon from Bush to draw that red line.
[02:26:11.173 --> 02:26:13.514]  I love the language that they use.
[02:26:14.094 --> 02:26:16.016]  We're taking this off the table.
[02:26:16.276 --> 02:26:18.577]  That's the other lovely one they use.
[02:26:18.597 --> 02:26:21.780]  We're taking it off the table and we're drawing a red line.
[02:26:22.300 --> 02:26:26.203]  Islamist rebels create dilemma on Syria policy.
[02:26:27.283 --> 02:26:37.450]  Nowhere in rebel-controlled Syria is there a secular fighting force to speak of, and this is from the toilet paper of record.
[02:26:38.391 --> 02:26:46.437]  So, following going back to how they keep screwing up and getting more opportunities to do so,
[02:26:48.171 --> 02:26:50.451]  Karl Rove, you remember him?
[02:26:50.471 --> 02:26:57.153]  That was Bush's front man, back man, side man, and man behind the scenes.
[02:26:57.233 --> 02:27:01.814]  Yeah, the porky pig of politics, Karl Rove.
[02:27:02.454 --> 02:27:05.195]  Yeah, Karl Rove on Bush legacy.
[02:27:06.275 --> 02:27:07.895]  He got the big things right.
[02:27:09.516 --> 02:27:15.837]  I do believe that the Iraq War was the right thing to do, and the world is a safer place
[02:27:17.193 --> 02:27:20.475]  For having Saddam Hussein gone.
[02:27:20.895 --> 02:27:22.356]  Don't you all feel happy?
[02:27:22.777 --> 02:27:24.058]  Don't you feel safe?
[02:27:24.538 --> 02:27:25.759]  Having a nice day?
[02:27:26.159 --> 02:27:28.441]  Who cares about Saddam Hussein?
[02:27:29.241 --> 02:27:41.649]  What a big lie, and how come these guys aren't brought up on war criminal charges to see who knew what when regarding WMDs or weapons of mass destruction.
[02:27:42.070 --> 02:27:43.251]  So Bush was
[02:27:44.151 --> 02:27:52.818]  Interviewed by all of the prostitutes on all of the channels from the mainstream media, and they all sucked up.
[02:27:53.419 --> 02:28:01.305]  And all Bush kept saying, and all the mouthpieces are saying is, let's let history decide.
[02:28:01.785 --> 02:28:05.548]  Oh yeah, let history decide if Bush messed up or not.
[02:28:06.229 --> 02:28:07.770]  Why let history decide?
[02:28:08.091 --> 02:28:10.212]  Let's decide now with the facts.
[02:28:10.633 --> 02:28:13.095]  I'll tell you why they want history to decide.
[02:28:14.315 --> 02:28:20.499]  Here he keeps going, here he goes, the Porky Pig of Politics, Karl Rove!
[02:28:22.020 --> 02:28:27.443]  The greats, you know, you can't touch George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, FDR, the greats.
[02:28:27.803 --> 02:28:37.810]  But yeah, I put George Bush up there, says Rove, who refers to a recent ABC Washington Post poll that found 40% approve of Bush.
[02:28:41.033 --> 02:28:48.017]  As evidence that he will continue to be remembered more keenly as time goes by.
[02:28:48.037 --> 02:28:57.322]  He'll be remembered more keenly as time goes by because everybody will forget what a screw-up he was.
[02:28:57.662 --> 02:29:01.264]  He didn't even show up on Inauguration Day!
[02:29:01.284 --> 02:29:04.706]  That's right, that's how much the people hated him.
[02:29:05.026 --> 02:29:06.067]  They booed him!
[02:29:06.727 --> 02:29:07.708]  They booed him.
[02:29:07.748 --> 02:29:09.429]  No, it was Cheney that didn't show up.
[02:29:09.709 --> 02:29:12.911]  They booed Bush when he showed up with Obama.
[02:29:13.931 --> 02:29:17.553]  They never booed a president, a leaving president before.
[02:29:18.094 --> 02:29:22.656]  Mussolini could have got elected after having eight years of Bush.
[02:29:23.176 --> 02:29:24.037]  And guess what?
[02:29:24.537 --> 02:29:25.338]  We got him.
[02:29:25.798 --> 02:29:26.638]  Fascism.
[02:29:27.919 --> 02:29:30.581]  The merger of state and corporate powers.
[02:29:31.653 --> 02:29:36.436]  And we're going to look at more of that when we come back with Trends in the News.
[02:29:36.456 --> 02:29:44.341]  And we're going to see why China is going to out-beat the United States as we keep going down.
[02:29:44.762 --> 02:29:47.864]  But there are other ways to go up, and we'll talk about those too.
[02:29:48.104 --> 02:29:50.765]  This is Gerald Clunting on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:29:50.785 --> 02:29:51.586]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.086 --> 02:29:53.687]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.707 --> 02:29:57.310]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.875 --> 02:30:02.876]  I had tried everything.
[02:30:02.956 --> 02:30:08.002]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating, I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[02:30:08.442 --> 02:30:12.907]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[02:30:13.267 --> 02:30:19.634]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[02:30:20.114 --> 02:30:30.604]  Now, there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.

[02:33:09.196 --> 02:33:13.017]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:14.717 --> 02:33:19.838]  Hey, I'm back, I'm back, and here's Dave Brubeck, take five.
[02:33:19.858 --> 02:33:25.339]  Hey, that was before rap.
[02:33:26.099 --> 02:33:28.800]  God, I grew up with Dave Brubeck, man.
[02:33:28.880 --> 02:33:29.840]  I love that stuff.
[02:33:31.209 --> 02:33:39.374]  This is Gerald Cilenti back on live on Alex Jones Show doing some of our trends in the news.
[02:33:40.115 --> 02:33:52.443]  And when I left off, I was talking about what's going on in Syria, what's going on in Iraq, and how this military-industrial complex is destroying the nation.
[02:33:53.183 --> 02:34:03.391]  And I said I would also give some positive elements of how we could turn this around, move forward, and rise to higher levels economically.
[02:34:03.811 --> 02:34:07.434]  Life of quality of life and quality of spirit.
[02:34:07.734 --> 02:34:09.736]  Because it really comes back to morality.
[02:34:10.396 --> 02:34:17.318]  Here, from the toilet paper today, armed men surround ministry in Tripoli.
[02:34:17.918 --> 02:34:31.702]  At least 20 pickup trucks loaded with anti-aircraft guns blocked the roads while men armed with AK-47s and sniper rifles directed traffic away from the buildings around the ministry.
[02:34:32.683 --> 02:34:32.903]  Hey!
[02:34:34.241 --> 02:34:39.062]  I heard Obama say that they were going to bring freedom and democracy to Libya.
[02:34:39.522 --> 02:34:45.343]  I heard that little weasel, Chicken Hawk Cameron, and Sarkozy from France.
[02:34:45.383 --> 02:34:46.343]  You remember him?
[02:34:46.363 --> 02:34:50.684]  Yeah, the guy that's now the former president of France.
[02:34:51.144 --> 02:35:00.746]  You know, the guy that now is going to be running a hedge fund, if everything goes right, saying how they were going to free those people of Libya from their oil.
[02:35:02.418 --> 02:35:03.860]  You think we'd be in Iraq?
[02:35:04.560 --> 02:35:06.583]  You think we'd be in any of these countries?
[02:35:07.063 --> 02:35:13.891]  Oh, Libya, by the way, has some of the best sweet crude oil on the planet.
[02:35:14.491 --> 02:35:16.774]  The whole system is breaking down.
[02:35:17.334 --> 02:35:21.639]  Everything they touch, they turn to garbage.
[02:35:21.699 --> 02:35:22.900]  They destroy it.
[02:35:23.661 --> 02:35:29.664]  When the government's, we have no business intervening in anyone else's country.
[02:35:30.225 --> 02:35:30.805]  Period.
[02:35:30.905 --> 02:35:31.725]  Paragraph.
[02:35:32.706 --> 02:35:34.287]  I am an American.
[02:35:35.647 --> 02:35:38.309]  I believe in the Constitution.
[02:35:39.069 --> 02:35:41.771]  I believe in the Declaration of Independence.
[02:35:42.131 --> 02:35:47.494]  And I believe in the principles upon which this country was founded.
[02:35:48.294 --> 02:36:05.079]  And when you see little cartoon characters like the Clintons and the Bushes and the Obamas doing their cheap routines and put them in a category with Madisons and Jeffersons,
[02:36:06.081 --> 02:36:22.419]  And Washingtons, who warned us not to become engaged in foreign entanglements, who are these little weasels like Lindsey Graham and McCain, insane McCain?
[02:36:22.700 --> 02:36:25.022]  And by the way, he's not a war hero.
[02:36:26.129 --> 02:36:26.369]  No.
[02:36:27.350 --> 02:36:34.933]  He crashed his plane a couple of times, couldn't land on the aircraft carrier, and if his old man wasn't an admiral, he would have been booted out.
[02:36:35.813 --> 02:36:37.193]  And what's he a hero for?
[02:36:37.594 --> 02:36:42.596]  Oh, he was flying over, bombing innocent Vietnamese, and they shot down his plane!
[02:36:42.876 --> 02:36:44.636]  That does not make you a hero!
[02:36:44.936 --> 02:36:48.478]  And these are the people that keep yelling, for more war!
[02:36:48.758 --> 02:36:49.358]  More war!
[02:36:49.418 --> 02:36:50.419]  Bring home the troops!
[02:36:50.719 --> 02:36:51.699]  Bring home the money!
[02:36:52.059 --> 02:36:53.300]  Rebuild America!
[02:36:54.315 --> 02:36:58.900]  This is garbage what these guys are talking, and you know you're not going to get the truth!
[02:36:59.461 --> 02:37:11.654]  Because all you have to do, if you want to torture yourself as I did the other night, watch the President's White House Correspondents Dinner.
[02:37:12.215 --> 02:37:15.358]  And you'll see the low level of human beings!
[02:37:16.752 --> 02:37:18.854]  That call themselves journalists.
[02:37:19.375 --> 02:37:21.557]  I love that guy on CNN.
[02:37:21.818 --> 02:37:22.699]  Don Lemon.
[02:37:23.099 --> 02:37:25.021]  Perfect name for the cat.
[02:37:25.401 --> 02:37:27.904]  A lemon if there ever was one.
[02:37:28.485 --> 02:37:29.466]  But I digress.
[02:37:30.267 --> 02:37:30.827]  A little bit.
[02:37:31.468 --> 02:37:33.711]  Let's move on to some more news.
[02:37:35.212 --> 02:37:36.273]  On the economic front.
[02:37:37.321 --> 02:37:40.443]  Companies feel pinch on sales in Europe.
[02:37:41.103 --> 02:37:44.205]  This is from the front page of today's Wall Street Journal.
[02:37:44.786 --> 02:37:56.373]  Yeah, US companies ranging from IBM, United Technologies, 3M, Xerox have missed revenue forecast, hurt by a combination of Europe's malaise.
[02:37:57.193 --> 02:38:02.657]  You see, if I had the BS button now, that word malaise,
[02:38:04.070 --> 02:38:05.070]  It's not a malaise.
[02:38:05.610 --> 02:38:06.690]  It's a depression.
[02:38:07.531 --> 02:38:08.931]  It's a depression in Greece.
[02:38:09.451 --> 02:38:12.632]  It's a depression in Spain.
[02:38:13.452 --> 02:38:17.092]  You're looking at unemployment rates that are approaching 30% officially.
[02:38:17.413 --> 02:38:24.574]  You're looking at over 52% unemployment, 57% unemployment rates in Spain, among the youth.
[02:38:25.234 --> 02:38:26.174]  Same thing in Greece.
[02:38:26.194 --> 02:38:26.934]  38% in Italy.
[02:38:26.954 --> 02:38:27.134]  Oh, Italy!
[02:38:27.174 --> 02:38:27.314]  Italy!
[02:38:31.530 --> 02:38:33.271]  They just elected a new government!
[02:38:33.772 --> 02:38:34.352]  Yeah!
[02:38:34.972 --> 02:38:36.754]  Hey, look at this stupid photo!
[02:38:37.234 --> 02:38:39.676]  Look at this moronic photo!
[02:38:39.696 --> 02:38:42.118]  They're everywhere!
[02:38:42.918 --> 02:38:43.779]  Everywhere!
[02:38:44.139 --> 02:38:49.363]  We have moron leaders leading us everywhere!
[02:38:50.023 --> 02:38:53.366]  Because these are the kind of people that want to get the jobs.
[02:38:54.086 --> 02:38:56.228]  And you read about this clown that got in.
[02:38:56.828 --> 02:38:57.609]  Another guy.
[02:38:58.029 --> 02:39:00.431]  Another guy that never worked a day in his life.
[02:39:02.947 --> 02:39:04.387]  What's his name over here?
[02:39:05.928 --> 02:39:07.548]  Enrico Letta.
[02:39:07.909 --> 02:39:09.349]  Enrico Letta.
[02:39:09.909 --> 02:39:11.850]  Yeah, Enrico Letta.
[02:39:13.850 --> 02:39:24.614]  Letta's uncle, Gianni, was Berlusconi's chief political aide.
[02:39:26.997 --> 02:39:33.199]  And you look at the new cabinet, the members of the three called Monty, the technocrat they put in there.
[02:39:34.080 --> 02:39:35.200]  One after another.
[02:39:35.440 --> 02:39:38.722]  Forget these labels that you hear on TV.
[02:39:39.302 --> 02:39:41.423]  Center left, center right.
[02:39:41.783 --> 02:39:46.985]  They're all, they're all a part of the financial mafia.
[02:39:48.191 --> 02:39:49.111]  That's all it is.
[02:39:49.151 --> 02:39:51.212]  There are two mafias running the show.
[02:39:51.872 --> 02:39:57.154]  The Money Changers Mafia and the Military Industrial Complex Mafia.
[02:39:57.634 --> 02:40:00.395]  It's a dictatorship of finance.
[02:40:00.995 --> 02:40:03.716]  It's the merger of state and corporate powers.
[02:40:04.437 --> 02:40:16.761]  One after another, you go down the list and every one of these Italian cats that are in high positions are Euro-centric, Euro-favored,
[02:40:18.243 --> 02:40:27.345]  Guys and women that want to take more power away from the people and centralize it under the money changes.
[02:40:28.485 --> 02:40:30.646]  Euro is a failure.
[02:40:31.106 --> 02:40:39.887]  Italy, Spain, Greece, Portugal, Ireland, they're suffering the worst downturn since the Great Depression.
[02:40:40.268 --> 02:40:42.488]  The euro is a failure.
[02:40:42.848 --> 02:40:44.468]  It's only 12 years old.
[02:40:47.389 --> 02:40:48.330]  Finito!
[02:40:48.630 --> 02:40:57.880]  They should bury it, but they're gonna prop it up because it's easy when you have a centralized currency, a centralized bank, to steal your money.
[02:40:58.621 --> 02:41:02.204]  Makes it a lot easier to do it in a lot of smaller deals.
[02:41:03.977 --> 02:41:06.659]  And a guy yesterday went berserk in Italy.
[02:41:07.399 --> 02:41:10.241]  Mayhem greets Italy's, quote, grand coalition.
[02:41:10.641 --> 02:41:12.982]  Grand coalition of mobsters!
[02:41:13.442 --> 02:41:14.863]  Here, this is the guy.
[02:41:15.544 --> 02:41:26.690]  Luigi Preti, 46, unemployed and apparently driven to desperation, opened fire with a pistol, wounding two police officers.
[02:41:27.711 --> 02:41:29.291]  This is from the Financial Times.
[02:41:30.792 --> 02:41:31.473]  Unemployed,
[02:41:32.478 --> 02:41:34.519]  Apparently driven to desperation.
[02:41:35.620 --> 02:41:43.184]  When people lose everything and have nothing left to lose, they lose it.
[02:41:44.484 --> 02:41:47.506]  And that's what we're seeing more and more of.
[02:41:48.486 --> 02:41:50.607]  Let's move on to some other news here.
[02:41:52.929 --> 02:41:55.010]  What do we got here in the Wall Street Journal?
[02:41:55.930 --> 02:41:56.010]  Oh!
[02:41:57.231 --> 02:41:59.052]  More about those Boston Bombers.
[02:41:59.772 --> 02:42:00.492]  This is a big story.
[02:42:03.479 --> 02:42:18.451]  Talk about the 19-year-old is being treated for gunshot wounds in his throat, head, and legs that he received during confrontations with police days after the April 15th bombing.
[02:42:19.332 --> 02:42:21.513]  I'd be hitting the BS button on that one.
[02:42:21.913 --> 02:42:22.634]  You know why?
[02:42:23.154 --> 02:42:24.675]  You remember the story.
[02:42:25.015 --> 02:42:26.956]  The story was in the Washington Post.
[02:42:27.276 --> 02:42:29.077]  The story was all over the media.
[02:42:29.498 --> 02:42:30.158]  That's right.
[02:42:30.578 --> 02:42:31.819]  There was a confrontation.
[02:42:32.199 --> 02:42:32.999]  You heard the word.
[02:42:33.019 --> 02:42:34.400]  There was a confrontation.
[02:42:34.420 --> 02:42:35.461]  They found them in the boat.
[02:42:35.481 --> 02:42:35.841]  Remember?
[02:42:36.081 --> 02:42:42.965]  The guy goes outside, he's having a smoke, sees the top on his boat's not put on right, sees some bloodstains.
[02:42:43.365 --> 02:42:45.046]  There's the kid lying there wounded.
[02:42:45.446 --> 02:42:46.507]  And what do the cops do?
[02:42:47.327 --> 02:42:48.669]  You remember the first story.
[02:42:48.689 --> 02:42:51.372]  They exchanged gunfire!
[02:42:51.752 --> 02:42:52.232]  Yeah!
[02:42:52.773 --> 02:42:53.594]  Yeah, that's right!
[02:42:54.295 --> 02:42:56.197]  They had, what, 9,000 troops there?
[02:42:56.617 --> 02:43:00.041]  They could have, you know, they could have led the Battle of the Bulge.
[02:43:00.101 --> 02:43:02.404]  They had enough equipment and men and armaments.
[02:43:04.522 --> 02:43:06.303]  So no, the gun battle never happened.
[02:43:06.443 --> 02:43:07.203]  It was a lie.
[02:43:07.604 --> 02:43:09.745]  Just like the other lie or misinformation.
[02:43:09.805 --> 02:43:10.545]  Excuse me.
[02:43:11.265 --> 02:43:15.508]  Misinformation about how they also robbed a 7-Eleven that they never robbed.
[02:43:15.968 --> 02:43:17.789]  So why would anybody believe anything?
[02:43:18.129 --> 02:43:19.430]  But here's the way they wrote it.
[02:43:19.890 --> 02:43:22.371]  Again, this is from the Wall Street Journal.
[02:43:22.731 --> 02:43:25.273]  Received during confrontations with police.
[02:43:26.144 --> 02:43:26.404]  No.
[02:43:27.084 --> 02:43:28.625]  They shot into the boat!
[02:43:28.725 --> 02:43:30.165]  The kid was lying there!
[02:43:30.925 --> 02:43:32.666]  Couldn't they say, come out with your hands up?
[02:43:33.506 --> 02:43:35.127]  Whatever happened to that one?
[02:43:37.267 --> 02:43:42.349]  What else do we have?
[02:43:43.609 --> 02:43:44.129]  Iceland.
[02:43:45.170 --> 02:43:47.750]  Iceland votes out pro-European leadership.
[02:43:48.511 --> 02:43:50.391]  Yay, yay, yay!
[02:43:51.352 --> 02:43:52.352]  Little Iceland.
[02:43:53.669 --> 02:43:55.392]  Tiny little Iceland.
[02:43:55.432 --> 02:43:57.394]  They didn't pay back the bankers.
[02:43:57.995 --> 02:43:59.698]  They're having a tough time over there.
[02:43:59.718 --> 02:44:06.687]  But they're not robbing the people of their money to give it to the banking operations.
[02:44:10.950 --> 02:44:19.315]  Little bit closer to home because, again, you know, I was listening to the opening of the show with Mr. Jasper and how things have to change.
[02:44:19.335 --> 02:44:30.621]  And, of course, when Alex Jones Show, he always talks about, you know, stopping the corruption and bringing the nation back to the people.
[02:44:31.461 --> 02:44:34.243]  Here's a little story in Sunday's New York Times.
[02:44:35.723 --> 02:44:39.926]  Many openings at state agency goes to ties
[02:44:41.138 --> 02:44:44.422]  Goes to those with ties to Governor Cuomo.
[02:44:45.483 --> 02:44:48.966]  I'm only mentioning this because it's the same thing everywhere.
[02:44:49.647 --> 02:44:53.952]  If you read about the guy they just arrested in Bosnia...
[02:44:55.216 --> 02:45:00.398]  The guy in France that was supposed to be cracking down on tax evaders.
[02:45:00.418 --> 02:45:01.618]  You know, that minister.
[02:45:02.199 --> 02:45:06.600]  And then they found out he had a couple of million dollars in a Swiss account.
[02:45:07.140 --> 02:45:09.721]  It's the same thing everywhere.
[02:45:10.381 --> 02:45:16.704]  And nothing is going to change, nothing, until the morality changes.
[02:45:17.784 --> 02:45:19.885]  And the fish rots from the head up.
[02:45:21.852 --> 02:45:25.436]  So, we learn by our leaders.
[02:45:26.057 --> 02:45:28.559]  We learn by those in power.
[02:45:29.320 --> 02:45:32.263]  And the power is corrupt from the top down.
[02:45:32.343 --> 02:45:32.524]  Here.
[02:45:34.181 --> 02:45:36.622]  New York State's Economic Development Agency.
[02:45:37.162 --> 02:45:41.964]  Economic Development Agencies, by the way, I got my Master's Degree in Public Administration.
[02:45:42.524 --> 02:45:43.865]  They're a waste of money.
[02:45:44.385 --> 02:45:48.027]  All they do is they give benefits to the very rich.
[02:45:48.467 --> 02:45:49.947]  Hey, I'm going to tell you what I'm going to do.
[02:45:49.987 --> 02:45:55.230]  I'm going to build a hotel in your dying town over here.
[02:45:55.590 --> 02:45:58.531]  I want a $10 million tax break.
[02:45:58.591 --> 02:46:01.992]  I want loan guarantees and some infrastructure repairs.
[02:46:02.313 --> 02:46:03.073]  And they do it.
[02:46:04.039 --> 02:46:05.260]  Which they should never do.
[02:46:05.340 --> 02:46:08.924]  But anyway.
[02:46:09.044 --> 02:46:12.807]  New York State Economic Development created a new position last June.
[02:46:12.827 --> 02:46:13.668]  A new position.
[02:46:14.249 --> 02:46:18.512]  We're paying taxes like crazy and they're creating a new position.
[02:46:19.622 --> 02:46:23.264]  And they found a candidate to fill it, a young man named Willard Younger.
[02:46:23.624 --> 02:46:30.048]  Yeah, young Willard Younger, who had just graduated from Colgate University with a degree.
[02:46:30.088 --> 02:46:30.988]  Now, check it out.
[02:46:31.429 --> 02:46:36.291]  If you want a degree in worthlessness, this guy couldn't do better.
[02:46:36.391 --> 02:46:38.072]  But I have one better, actually.
[02:46:38.352 --> 02:46:39.593]  And you'll hear that one, too.
[02:46:40.534 --> 02:46:43.455]  A degree in classics and religion.
[02:46:44.116 --> 02:46:47.918]  Now, you know what a degree in classics and religion gets you?
[02:46:48.846 --> 02:47:00.050]  It gets you a job with the Economic Development Agency, a special projects assistant, and a salary of $45,000 a year.
[02:47:02.591 --> 02:47:06.953]  Now, wouldn't you think if they put an ad out
[02:47:08.783 --> 02:47:18.648]  For a Projects Associate at a salary of $45,000 a year that could have actually gotten somebody qualified and with experience?
[02:47:20.409 --> 02:47:21.210]  Or could it be?
[02:47:21.230 --> 02:47:26.433]  I mean, being, you know, there are several million people in New York.
[02:47:27.560 --> 02:47:41.664]  His father, Steven P. Younger, is a lawyer and power broker in legal circles who was a member of one of Governor Andrew M. Cuomo's transitions team, and he's also donated $26,000.
[02:47:42.444 --> 02:47:49.366]  Yeah, to Mr. Cuomo's campaign over the years.
[02:47:49.466 --> 02:47:50.147]  Oh, nice.
[02:47:50.947 --> 02:47:52.147]  Oh, donated campaign.
[02:47:52.167 --> 02:47:54.208]  You know what these are called in real language?
[02:47:55.968 --> 02:47:57.370]  Not campaign donations.
[02:47:57.790 --> 02:47:59.492]  They're called bribes and payoffs.
[02:47:59.732 --> 02:48:00.893]  And you saw the payoff.
[02:48:01.314 --> 02:48:04.017]  That's why I'm a believer in direct democracy.
[02:48:04.457 --> 02:48:05.839]  The whole system is rigged.
[02:48:06.599 --> 02:48:09.222]  And if you're not in it, you don't get anything from it.
[02:48:09.583 --> 02:48:11.705]  This story actually gets a lot better, you know.
[02:48:12.446 --> 02:48:14.668]  It's one stupid thing after another.
[02:48:14.688 --> 02:48:17.991]  And the jobs that these guys get...
[02:48:18.672 --> 02:48:20.633]  There's this other guy, Mr. Molis.
[02:48:21.134 --> 02:48:28.899]  He was hired at $75,000 a year as a strategic planner associate.
[02:48:29.280 --> 02:48:37.406]  He graduated with a degree in A-S-S-Y-R-I-O-L-O-G-Y.
[02:48:37.966 --> 02:48:39.207]  Assyriology.
[02:48:39.667 --> 02:48:42.589]  The study of ancient Mesopotamia.
[02:48:42.609 --> 02:48:43.670]  Yeah!
[02:48:44.230 --> 02:48:44.531]  Yeah!
[02:48:46.380 --> 02:48:56.228]  His ties, his father and his father's real estate firm have donated a total of $75,000 to the Cuomo campaign.
[02:48:56.928 --> 02:48:59.831]  So I guess they broke even on that one, huh?
[02:48:59.851 --> 02:49:04.614]  $75,000 into the campaign, $75,000 a year into his son's pocket.
[02:49:05.075 --> 02:49:10.299]  The whole game is rigged all over the world.
[02:49:11.920 --> 02:49:14.482]  So the stock market's going up a little bit today.
[02:49:14.842 --> 02:49:15.323]  How come?
[02:49:16.462 --> 02:49:20.185]  Well, as I said earlier, good news, good news!
[02:49:20.485 --> 02:49:23.428]  The Fed's going to keep its foot on the pedal!
[02:49:23.888 --> 02:49:24.729]  That's right!
[02:49:24.989 --> 02:49:27.591]  Pumping more money, that's boosting the market.
[02:49:28.512 --> 02:49:29.813]  Now, this is important.
[02:49:32.074 --> 02:49:35.677]  Interest rates, as we know, are at historic lows.
[02:49:36.318 --> 02:49:42.423]  So the other reason that the market's going up is pending home sales increased 1.5 percent
[02:49:44.990 --> 02:49:49.993]  After a revised 1% decline the prior month.
[02:49:53.354 --> 02:49:57.256]  It was 0.4% when it came out with this number.
[02:49:57.276 --> 02:49:57.976]  Now remember, 1.5%.
[02:50:04.244 --> 02:50:08.925]  This is after dumping trillions of dollars into the economy.
[02:50:09.425 --> 02:50:13.746]  This is after keeping interest rates at record lows.
[02:50:14.246 --> 02:50:23.589]  And this is after the FHA are giving out loans with people only putting down 5%.
[02:50:25.249 --> 02:50:33.451]  So you can see, even with all of this juice going in, it's not going to be a happy ending.
[02:50:35.219 --> 02:50:42.581]  And again, that's why I believe in gold.
[02:50:43.621 --> 02:50:46.181]  Gold is golden.
[02:50:47.121 --> 02:50:50.502]  Because they're gonna keep having to pump more money into it.
[02:50:51.762 --> 02:50:52.763]  It ain't working.
[02:50:53.603 --> 02:50:54.463]  Not gonna work.
[02:50:56.143 --> 02:50:59.464]  But don't worry, they'll get us to war and that'll get your mind off it.
[02:51:01.656 --> 02:51:03.557]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[02:51:03.597 --> 02:51:05.499]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[02:51:05.739 --> 02:51:11.223]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[02:51:11.983 --> 02:51:15.186]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[02:51:15.446 --> 02:51:19.168]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[02:51:19.329 --> 02:51:20.509]  The fact is, you are.
[02:51:20.710 --> 02:51:21.490]  We all are.
[02:51:21.730 --> 02:51:24.072]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[02:51:24.352 --> 02:51:32.637]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoods Direct.
[02:51:32.858 --> 02:51:34.058]  Be prepared before you need it.
[02:51:34.238 --> 02:51:37.401]  With nutrient-dense food you can store for up to 25 years.
[02:51:37.681 --> 02:51:39.922]  You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed you.
[02:51:40.062 --> 02:51:44.445]  Do what I've done and get your own supply of the best storable foods out there from eFoods Direct.

[02:52:01.433 --> 02:52:04.974]  Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins.
[02:52:05.314 --> 02:52:06.035]  That bears repeating.
[02:52:06.335 --> 02:52:09.856]  Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins.
[02:52:10.216 --> 02:52:14.458]  And Pro-EM1 Daily Probiotic Cleanse is the key to digestive health.
[02:52:14.778 --> 02:52:20.240]  Pro-EM1 is a powerful liquid probiotic, strong enough to cleanse, gentle enough to use every day.
[02:52:20.620 --> 02:52:22.841]  Pro-EM-1 is dairy, wheat, and soy free.

[02:52:25.583 --> 02:52:27.484]  Contains no preservatives or animal products.
[02:52:27.744 --> 02:52:29.705]  Supports a healthy digestive and immune system.
[02:52:29.825 --> 02:52:30.566]  Supports weight loss.
[02:52:30.846 --> 02:52:32.367]  Improves absorption of food nutrients.
[02:52:32.687 --> 02:52:34.048]  Aids in controlling yeast infections.
[02:52:34.308 --> 02:52:35.548]  Is never freeze-dried.
[02:52:35.889 --> 02:52:39.751]  And uses three groups of live, viable, beneficial microbes to cleanse and remove toxins.

[02:53:00.745 --> 02:53:03.449]  Do you suffer from low-functioning adrenal or thyroid gland?
[02:53:03.669 --> 02:53:09.397]  Did you know that mercury from your dental fillings comes off your teeth both as a vapor and as metal particles into your body?
[02:53:09.518 --> 02:53:13.263]  Wherever mercury deposits in your body, it stops cells from functioning normally.
[02:53:13.523 --> 02:53:16.327]  Animal studies show that mercury causes kidney function to drop by 60%.
[02:53:17.449 --> 02:53:17.809]  I don't know.
[02:53:35.228 --> 02:53:47.411]  After investigating most high-end whey proteins on the market, only one is the most non-denatured, the most active, the most complete, and in our opinion, the most powerful in what nature originally put into the fresh raw whey.
[02:53:47.771 --> 02:53:49.332]  It is One World Whey.

[02:54:08.280 --> 02:54:09.921]  Last segment, last segment.
[02:54:10.041 --> 02:54:11.501]  Thank you Alex Jones.
[02:54:11.521 --> 02:54:24.165]  This is the Alex Jones Show and this is Gerald Cilenti giving you an example of our Trends in the News that we do every Monday through Friday as part of your subscription to the Trends Journal.
[02:54:24.705 --> 02:54:28.849]  Now, I said I was going to give some positive elements, say a little bit more about China.
[02:54:29.290 --> 02:54:31.632]  China's going to do better than the United States.
[02:54:31.952 --> 02:54:34.055]  I don't believe China's going to go to war.
[02:54:34.395 --> 02:54:36.397]  They're building their internal economy.
[02:54:36.637 --> 02:54:41.822]  They have 1.2 billion people there, and they have a lot of business to do with each other.
[02:54:42.483 --> 02:54:44.645]  And that's where they're going to go in the future.
[02:54:45.025 --> 02:54:47.106]  And that's the way America should go.
[02:54:47.486 --> 02:54:49.488]  That's the way Italy should go.
[02:54:49.828 --> 02:54:53.731]  You know my saying, think for yourself, that's the way I see it.
[02:54:54.291 --> 02:54:56.793]  I want my money staying in my country.
[02:54:57.073 --> 02:54:58.454]  I don't want it going anywhere.
[02:54:58.754 --> 02:55:01.656]  Anywhere in foreign aid, anywhere in foreign products.
[02:55:02.116 --> 02:55:06.199]  I want to buy shoes from America.
[02:55:06.439 --> 02:55:08.761]  I want to buy my shirts made in America.
[02:55:09.281 --> 02:55:12.043]  And I want to buy all my product local.
[02:55:12.923 --> 02:55:19.488]  And boy, do we have great local product up here in Colonial Kingston in the heart of the Hudson Valley.
[02:55:19.968 --> 02:55:26.293]  I just had some coca-cola that they made over here locally that was as good as I've had in Italy.
[02:55:26.793 --> 02:55:34.038]  The way we bring this back is we do business with each other, just like the Chinese are going to do.
[02:55:34.358 --> 02:55:39.222]  And hey, if it's good enough for the Chinese, why shouldn't it be good enough for us?
[02:55:39.944 --> 02:55:51.930]  Or maybe you want to buy that next shirt from another sweatshop that blows up, burns down, or is destroyed in Bangladesh that just killed 400 people.
[02:55:52.650 --> 02:55:58.633]  So you could go shopping at a large self-storage unit that they call Walmart or Target.
[02:55:59.553 --> 02:56:00.474]  Buy local.
[02:56:00.774 --> 02:56:07.137]  And number one, again, think for yourself, only what I'm saying, break the chains.
[02:56:08.652 --> 02:56:12.736]  If you're gonna go out for a cup of coffee, break the chains!
[02:56:12.836 --> 02:56:13.636]  Go local!
[02:56:14.317 --> 02:56:15.718]  Break the chains!
[02:56:16.098 --> 02:56:18.681]  We have become corporate slaves!
[02:56:20.182 --> 02:56:27.028]  Unless, of course, you go to Colgate, and your old man gives Cuomo money, or whatever other state you live in.
[02:56:27.508 --> 02:56:30.471]  Then you'll get a good job with your degree in worthlessness.
[02:56:32.793 --> 02:56:34.875]  So those are some positive elements.
[02:56:36.038 --> 02:56:38.781]  The future doesn't have to be the way it's going.
[02:56:39.342 --> 02:56:41.023]  We create the future.
[02:56:41.524 --> 02:56:44.727]  Again, go back to the beginning of this program.
[02:56:45.328 --> 02:56:47.370]  Look at that Correspondents' Dinner.
[02:56:47.851 --> 02:56:50.173]  Look at these low-life politicians.
[02:56:50.894 --> 02:56:53.317]  Look how low they have taken this nation.
[02:56:55.236 --> 02:56:57.217]  So I want to thank Alex Jones.
[02:56:57.957 --> 02:56:59.957]  I love being on this show.
[02:57:00.398 --> 02:57:01.798]  Keep up the good fight.
[02:57:01.938 --> 02:57:03.278]  Everyone join in.
[02:57:03.759 --> 02:57:06.680]  And now I want to turn it over to Jakari Jackson.
[02:57:07.060 --> 02:57:11.041]  This is Gerald Cilenti and that was some of today's Trends in the News.
[02:57:12.335 --> 02:57:14.157]  Alright, Jakari Jackson back here live.
[02:57:14.377 --> 02:57:15.699]  Gerald, is Gerald still with us?
[02:57:15.719 --> 02:57:19.804]  I just want to ask, Mr. Salente, if I can ask you, you ended talking about China.
[02:57:19.844 --> 02:57:25.670]  How do you feel about the Chinese market telling us how to make our movies, demanding edits to movies like World War Z and Iron Man 3?
[02:57:27.639 --> 02:57:30.281]  Hey, the Chinese own our money.
[02:57:30.381 --> 02:57:32.282]  You know, they're buying up all the movie theaters.
[02:57:32.302 --> 02:57:34.843]  They're buying up a whole chain of movie theaters.
[02:57:35.564 --> 02:57:36.184]  You know that.
[02:57:36.324 --> 02:57:37.545]  They own a big chain.
[02:57:37.625 --> 02:57:39.426]  So, you know, they're in control.
[02:57:39.446 --> 02:57:40.527]  The golden rule.
[02:57:40.927 --> 02:57:42.508]  Those who have the gold rule.
[02:57:43.189 --> 02:57:44.049]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:57:44.349 --> 02:57:46.611]  Now, Mr. Salenti, how can people get a hold of your materials?
[02:57:47.594 --> 02:57:51.456]  TrendsJournal.com, TrendsJournal.com, and Jakari.
[02:57:51.917 --> 02:57:55.439]  We know that people are having a difficult time, you know, making ends meet.
[02:57:55.699 --> 02:57:57.560]  We have a discount request page there.
[02:57:57.920 --> 02:58:03.064]  We try to make the Trends Journal available to everybody so that they can prepare for the future.
[02:58:03.304 --> 02:58:08.187]  There's a bright future for those who see the future and move in the right directions.
[02:58:09.107 --> 02:58:11.389]  All right, Gerald Cilente, definitely appreciate your time, sir.
[02:58:12.051 --> 02:58:12.892]  Thank you, Jakari.
[02:58:13.312 --> 02:58:16.254]  All right, well, that's it for this edition of the Alex Jones Radio Show.
[02:58:16.314 --> 02:58:20.836]  Thanks to Mr. Salente, Alex, David Knight, and everybody else who had a hand in this.
[02:58:20.896 --> 02:58:22.397]  The great crew working overtime.
[02:58:23.058 --> 02:58:26.340]  Alex will be back, or at least Skyping in, I should say, tomorrow.
[02:58:26.860 --> 02:58:29.622]  Also, myself, maybe David Knight will be back in here as well.
[02:58:29.942 --> 02:58:31.002]  So, InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:58:31.062 --> 02:58:33.164]  Tonight, David Knight will be hosting.
[02:58:33.424 --> 02:58:36.045]  Civil Seabell Admins, excuse me, will be our guest.
[02:58:36.066 --> 02:58:36.566]  We'll see you then.
[02:58:42.892 --> 02:58:44.738]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
