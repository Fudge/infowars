[00:00:23.143 --> 00:00:24.865]  Welcome to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:24.925 --> 00:00:26.207]  I'm your host, Jakari Jackson.
[00:00:26.467 --> 00:00:28.410]  Here's what we have in store for you on this June 24, 2013 edition.
[00:00:32.639 --> 00:00:35.201]  Tonight on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:36.262 --> 00:00:38.883]  Where in the world is Edward Snowden?
[00:00:39.164 --> 00:00:44.167]  Questions raised after the whistleblower misses a flight from Moscow to Cuba.
[00:00:44.808 --> 00:00:48.971]  Then, one week of military spending could wipe out world hunger.
[00:00:49.411 --> 00:00:53.034]  Plus, do you have a problem with the city water?
[00:00:53.254 --> 00:00:55.355]  Well, you might be a terrorist.
[00:00:55.856 --> 00:00:58.638]  All that and more on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:03.491]  And welcome back.
[00:01:03.811 --> 00:01:07.754]  Top story headline, NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden goes missing.
[00:01:08.135 --> 00:01:10.257]  Now briefly, a synopsis about Mr. Snowden.
[00:01:10.277 --> 00:01:12.138]  He was a NSA worker.
[00:01:12.198 --> 00:01:13.780]  He also had ties to the CIA.
[00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.065]  He blew the whistle on the prison system that's prison with an M. He said, hey, a lot of these people are spying you.
[00:01:19.765 --> 00:01:22.846]  Microsoft, Google, as well as many of your social networking sites.
[00:01:23.126 --> 00:01:25.426]  He fled to Hong Kong, and that's where we pick up the story.
[00:01:25.946 --> 00:01:36.389]  After Snowden left Hong Kong yesterday for Moscow, he was expected to board an Aeroloft plane scheduled to fly to Havana, the next stop on his journey to a planned political asylum in Ecuador.
[00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:40.990]  However, journalists who boarded the same plane immediately noted that Snowden's seat was empty.
[00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:52.958]  The article goes on to say, earlier today, Ecuadorian Foreign Minister Ricardo Patin said he didn't know the whereabouts of Snowden, adding that his request for political asylum was still under investigation.
[00:01:53.598 --> 00:01:58.862]  Wikileaks' Julian Assange has been protected by the Ecuadorian Embassy in London for over a year.
[00:01:59.342 --> 00:02:05.747]  Now, Assange also claims to know the whereabouts of not only Snowden, but also his, I won't say his accomplice, but the person who was accompanying him
[00:02:06.347 --> 00:02:06.887]  I think so.
[00:02:26.938 --> 00:02:28.980]  So, you know, believe what you will.
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.383]  Assange claims he knows where he is, so you can believe that if you want.
[00:02:32.703 --> 00:02:36.926]  But it ties into this article talking about Assange and his asylum in Ecuador.
[00:02:36.946 --> 00:02:38.268]  We have this article from Mike Adams.
[00:02:38.728 --> 00:02:39.669]  Ed Snowden, beware.
[00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:40.109]  U.S.
[00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:45.534]  State Department has confirmed history of running covert abductions of Americans in Ecuador.
[00:02:45.994 --> 00:02:50.698]  Now, this goes down to say, herbalist Greg Canton, you know, he was kidnapped back in 2009.
[00:02:52.499 --> 00:02:53.000]  By U.S.
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:00.065]  authorities in Ecuador, and they said he was an enemy of the state for doing what you might ask, giving his own remedy to cancer.
[00:03:00.125 --> 00:03:08.292]  He's found a remedy that, you know, I guess worked for him and worked for his patients, and he supplied this to the people in that location, and they said, hey, we can't have this.
[00:03:08.572 --> 00:03:11.194]  They sent in a team, they bribed some people, had a few payoffs.
[00:03:11.474 --> 00:03:19.441]  They went in and pretty much kidnapped this guy in Ecuador, so definitely beware, Mrs. Snowden, if you did make it to Ecuador, if that's where you're
[00:03:19.921 --> 00:03:20.721]  Planning to travel.
[00:03:20.821 --> 00:03:25.083]  Two, definitely take that into consideration and definitely read the full article from Mike Adams.
[00:03:25.383 --> 00:03:26.124]  We'll move on to this.
[00:03:26.604 --> 00:03:30.725]  California Senate passes bill requiring permit to buy ammo.
[00:03:31.266 --> 00:03:33.506]  Yeah, it does seem pretty ridiculous, don't you think?
[00:03:33.947 --> 00:03:44.671]  The California Senate this week approved a collection of bills, including one, SB 53, that would require background checks, permits, and fees for the purchase of ammunition.
[00:03:45.231 --> 00:03:56.714]  All ammunition sales would have to be face-to-face, happening only in the presence of a store clerk, and vendors selling the bullets would have to submit a sales record to the California Department of Justice.
[00:03:57.594 --> 00:04:00.437]  These vendors would also need a permit to sell ammunition.
[00:04:00.818 --> 00:04:07.366]  Kira Davis noted that SB 53 requires background checks in a $50 ammo purchase fee.
[00:04:08.327 --> 00:04:12.272]  So I'm not exactly clear if that's for every box of bullets sold.
[00:04:12.332 --> 00:04:13.293]  I definitely hope it's not.
[00:04:13.693 --> 00:04:16.477]  But to say that you need to submit to a background check
[00:04:16.897 --> 00:04:22.259]  To purchase ammunition and not only that, pay them to do said thing is just complete overreach.
[00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.881]  These people have truly lost their mind.
[00:04:24.921 --> 00:04:27.022]  I'll just say what it is, they've lost their minds.
[00:04:27.042 --> 00:04:32.664]  Because think about it, you can go out and buy as much alcohol as you want, no permit or special thing required.
[00:04:32.684 --> 00:04:35.766]  You can go out and buy many things as much as you want, no permit required.
[00:04:35.786 --> 00:04:38.507]  But this reminded me of an article that we reported on earlier this year.
[00:04:39.107 --> 00:04:44.389]  Florida State Senator files bill requiring anger management before buying ammunition.
[00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:47.211]  You can see it right there and we can scroll down a little bit.
[00:04:47.871 --> 00:05:01.557]  It would require a three-day waiting period for the sale of any firearm and also would make it a crime to buy ammunition unless you presented a certificate showing you completed a minimum two-hour anger management program either online or face-to-face.
[00:05:03.073 --> 00:05:12.403]  And somebody made the joke, one of my friends was saying, you know, making somebody take anger management to buy bullets is like forcing somebody to go to an AA meeting before they ever buy their sixth pack of beer.
[00:05:12.803 --> 00:05:16.547]  And I would agree, it does sound completely ridiculous and way far-fetched.
[00:05:16.888 --> 00:05:21.673]  And I don't believe this person is a bad person, this Senator Aubrey Gibson.
[00:05:22.273 --> 00:05:24.375]  Or Audrey Gibson, I should say, out of Florida.
[00:05:24.395 --> 00:05:26.757]  The last person out in California.
[00:05:26.778 --> 00:05:33.504]  These are, I'm sure, well-meaning, good people who want these things, just want something, have a knee-jerk reaction.
[00:05:33.844 --> 00:05:37.768]  And they just want to do something about these epidemics, these school shootings and so forth.
[00:05:38.068 --> 00:05:39.910]  But they go about it the wrong way, in my opinion.
[00:05:41.071 --> 00:05:42.873]  Find some other way to help people.
[00:05:44.215 --> 00:05:52.964]  Exactly what that would be, I don't know, but making people submit information that just gives the government more knowledge as to your whereabouts, your activities, what you're interested in.
[00:05:53.065 --> 00:05:54.726]  I don't think that's the right way to do it.
[00:05:55.207 --> 00:05:58.190]  Now we'll go on to this, talking about the way the world is
[00:05:58.891 --> 00:06:01.993]  Viewing bullets and so forth, about one week of U.S.
[00:06:02.013 --> 00:06:05.015]  military spending would wipe out world hunger.
[00:06:05.115 --> 00:06:07.496]  Common sense just isn't so common.
[00:06:07.817 --> 00:06:16.422]  World hunger, an expense that has been calculated about $30 billion per year, that's billion with a B. To put that into perspective for you, the U.S.
[00:06:16.522 --> 00:06:26.849]  military spent $737 billion, that's billion with a B, on military defense in 2012, $30 billion of which would be about eight days of such an expenditure.
[00:06:27.881 --> 00:06:31.524]  But, you know, you may be sitting at home and you're saying, hey, it's not the U.S.'
[00:06:31.484 --> 00:06:32.885]  's job to feed the whole world.
[00:06:32.905 --> 00:06:33.765]  And I would agree with you.
[00:06:33.805 --> 00:06:37.808]  And Mr. Gucciardi, who wrote this article, he would also agree with you as well.
[00:06:37.868 --> 00:06:38.809]  But think about this.
[00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:40.310]  It's not our job as the U.S.
[00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:46.795]  to be Team America, World Police, to do nation building, to arm Syrian rebels who have pledged themselves to Al Qaeda.
[00:06:47.095 --> 00:06:48.576]  It's not our job to do that either.
[00:06:49.076 --> 00:06:51.178]  But we seem to do that with no problem.
[00:06:51.838 --> 00:06:58.427]  You know, 30 billion, that's a whole lot, but you could feed, you know, maybe some starving kids every, you know, a couple places, but nobody wants to do that.
[00:06:58.467 --> 00:07:00.690]  It's just, common sense just isn't so common.
[00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:07.118]  We'd much rather shoot up these kids' homelands and have them suck up the depleted uranium than actually give them a sandwich.
[00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:08.500]  We'll move on to this.
[00:07:09.201 --> 00:07:13.984]  Destruction of genetically engineered sugar beets in county brings in the FBI.
[00:07:14.525 --> 00:07:21.589]  The FBI is calling the destruction of two crops of genetically engineered sugar beets in Jackson County economic sabotage.
[00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:32.137]  According to an FBI release, one 1,000 plant crop was destroyed during the night on June 8th and another 5,500 plant crop was destroyed overnight on June 11th.
[00:07:32.877 --> 00:07:37.198]  Each on separate properties, Syngenta partially leases from private landowners.
[00:07:37.658 --> 00:07:45.020]  The crimes are considered economic sabotage and a violation of federal law involving damage to commercial agricultural enterprises.
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:51.962]  Steele, that's FBI agent Steele, said domestic terrorism charges are certainly an avenue that will be looked at.
[00:07:52.382 --> 00:07:57.383]  It depends on the particular facts of investigation that are uncovered between now and then.
[00:07:58.382 --> 00:08:10.648]  No, I'm not a farmer, I'm not an agriculture specialist in any way, but to say that damaging crops is somehow an act of terrorism is a little far-fetched as far as I'm concerned.
[00:08:10.668 --> 00:08:22.374]  You know, they brought in two FBI agents and instead of calling this, you know, property damage or some type of vandalism, and you know, I definitely feel for the farmers, you know, that's your crop, that's how you eat and feed your family and so forth, but to call it
[00:08:23.174 --> 00:08:23.515]  Yes, we are.
[00:08:36.247 --> 00:08:38.689]  I can't believe I'm saying this, a GMO false flag.
[00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:49.154]  They're saying many activists in the community are saying, hey, you know, we're anti-GMO, we're proactive against groups such as Monsanto, but we have no desire to go out and destroy their crops.
[00:08:49.475 --> 00:08:51.196]  And it leads us on to this article.
[00:08:51.596 --> 00:08:53.797]  Modified wheat is discovered in Oregon.
[00:08:54.397 --> 00:08:58.300]  Unapproved genetically engineered wheat has been found growing on a farm in Oregon.
[00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:02.308]  The wheat is the same type that has been developed by Monsanto.
[00:09:02.689 --> 00:09:09.203]  The Department of Agriculture said it is not known yet whether any of the wheat got into the food supply or into grain shipments.
[00:09:10.191 --> 00:09:11.752]  Now let's take this into perspective.
[00:09:12.152 --> 00:09:17.056]  The last one with the Sugar Beets, the last article with the Sugar Beets was talking about how they brought in the FBI on this.
[00:09:17.836 --> 00:09:20.398]  In Oregon, it's just the Department of Agriculture.
[00:09:20.698 --> 00:09:23.220]  So why the feds on one and not on the other?
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:24.981]  It just leads to more speculation.
[00:09:25.001 --> 00:09:26.922]  This could be some type of GMO false flag.
[00:09:26.942 --> 00:09:34.227]  There have been activists who have contacted us from the from the first incident with the Sugar Beets saying, hey, we had nothing to do with this.
[00:09:34.267 --> 00:09:39.891]  You know, we're all a tight knit community banded together against GMOs and we had nothing to do with this.
[00:09:40.631 --> 00:09:53.317]  And, you know, these crops turned up missing and damaged and so forth, but we have this other situation in Oregon where the FBI's not called in and, you know, if you would bring in the FBI on this one, why not bring in the FBI on that one?
[00:09:53.637 --> 00:09:55.698]  And you can read the rest of that in the New York Times.
[00:09:56.078 --> 00:09:59.440]  And it's just another way to get you into the system, to call you a terrorist.
[00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:02.382]  It's like giving you felonies for releasing balloons and so forth.
[00:10:02.622 --> 00:10:07.885]  But they're saying, no, this goes beyond, you know, misdemeanors and municipalities.
[00:10:08.185 --> 00:10:10.507]  You're a terrorist if you participate in these actions.
[00:10:10.787 --> 00:10:11.647]  And it brings us to this.
[00:10:11.967 --> 00:10:15.349]  Bureaucrat, water complaints could be an act of terrorism.
[00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:24.355]  You need to make sure that when you make water quality complaints, you have basis because federally,
[00:10:25.445 --> 00:10:33.172]  If there's no water quality issues, that can be considered under Homeland Security an act of terrorism.
[00:10:35.014 --> 00:10:43.777]  So the Harvard studies on fluoride, they're not a factual basis to make these claims about water purification, about fluoride in the water and so forth.
[00:10:44.137 --> 00:10:52.260]  So maybe this gentleman who was making these claims that you're a terrorist for even questioning the water supply, maybe he should look into those type of things.
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:57.262]  And it's just that, just like we said with the last article, it's just another way to rope you in to being a terrorist.
[00:10:57.342 --> 00:10:59.183]  And to cap this off, we'll show you this one.
[00:11:00.003 --> 00:11:02.424]  It's from September of last year from Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:11:02.744 --> 00:11:06.646]  DOJ-funded training manual lists bumper stickers as terrorism.
[00:11:06.726 --> 00:11:07.347]  Bumper stickers.
[00:11:07.747 --> 00:11:10.768]  Bumper stickers are now a terrorist threat.
[00:11:11.409 --> 00:11:24.295]  The state and local anti-terrorism training, funded by the Department of Justice, lists political bumper stickers expressing opposition to the United Nations and the support for the Bill of Rights as indicators of terrorist activity.
[00:11:24.635 --> 00:11:27.237]  Now, if we can scroll down a little bit, I think it's, yeah, it's right there.
[00:11:27.817 --> 00:11:29.258]  Let's just read some of these bumper stickers.
[00:11:30.177 --> 00:11:31.838]  Know your rights, or lose them.
[00:11:31.898 --> 00:11:34.160]  And also, get us out of the United Nations.
[00:11:34.621 --> 00:11:38.544]  Things such as that, and I think if we scroll down a little bit more, we can actually see some of these bumper stickers.
[00:11:39.385 --> 00:11:40.766]  Okay, yeah, let's take a look here.
[00:11:41.426 --> 00:11:42.587]  Alright, call to arms.
[00:11:42.707 --> 00:11:44.169]  Get us out of the United Nations.
[00:11:44.249 --> 00:11:45.790]  Oh, that sounds pretty wicked.
[00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:47.691]  What else they got down there?
[00:11:48.092 --> 00:11:49.133]  Okay, got a guy tagging.
[00:11:49.153 --> 00:11:50.514]  Shouldn't be tagging, but you know, whatever.
[00:11:51.114 --> 00:11:52.175]  Alright, and just more of the same.
[00:11:52.495 --> 00:11:57.940]  You know, if you don't like GMOs, if you like bumper stickers, and you don't like being in the UN,
[00:11:59.257 --> 00:12:03.879]  If you say, hey, I don't want somebody from the UN to come and save me in a zombie invasion, which they really didn't do anyway.
[00:12:05.339 --> 00:12:09.281]  World War Z, if anybody had a chance to see that, I didn't really think too much of the film.
[00:12:09.721 --> 00:12:13.202]  But yeah, just say, I want to get out of the UN, and that's how it goes.
[00:12:13.702 --> 00:12:15.903]  And for our last story, we go to this out of Wired.
[00:12:16.303 --> 00:12:19.865]  CodeFellas, this is a video about the weird people who spy on us.
[00:12:20.605 --> 00:12:22.046]  I'm sorry, I think you have the wrong number.
[00:12:22.106 --> 00:12:23.646]  Your name is Nicole Winters.
[00:12:24.106 --> 00:12:25.687]  You're 22 years old, single.
[00:12:26.075 --> 00:12:31.478]  Unless things escalate with the handsome young man who came by your apartment last night at 11.32 PM precisely.
[00:12:31.998 --> 00:12:32.839]  How did you get this number?
[00:12:33.059 --> 00:12:34.740]  Your favorite food is Kung Pao Chicken.
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.861]  You were kicked out of Brown University.
[00:12:37.141 --> 00:12:37.482]  Brown?
[00:12:38.102 --> 00:12:39.323]  Are you calling about my student loans?
[00:12:39.643 --> 00:12:40.463]  Calm down, Ms.
[00:12:40.503 --> 00:12:40.864]  Winters.
[00:12:41.404 --> 00:12:42.305]  This is Henry Topple.
[00:12:42.825 --> 00:12:43.725]  You've been assigned to me.
[00:12:43.825 --> 00:12:44.546]  Congratulations.
[00:12:44.746 --> 00:12:45.987]  Oh, Special Agent Topple.
[00:12:46.407 --> 00:12:47.648]  I'm so sorry I didn't know it was you.
[00:12:48.522 --> 00:12:50.683]  That's probably not too far from the truth.
[00:12:50.723 --> 00:12:53.344]  People who enjoy spying on each other in the office.
[00:12:53.384 --> 00:12:57.825]  Hey Bill, you went out to the baseball game last night and oh, Susie's cheating on her husband.
[00:12:57.845 --> 00:13:02.167]  You know, these are the type of people that they like to recruit to spy on you and your family.
[00:13:02.187 --> 00:13:07.009]  People who get off on this type of information and I definitely encourage you guys to go and watch that in its entirety.
[00:13:07.409 --> 00:13:08.769]  Let's go now to our quote of the day.
[00:13:08.789 --> 00:13:09.990]  This is from Stephen Colbert.
[00:13:11.053 --> 00:13:16.937]  If you're doing nothing wrong, you have nothing to hide from the giant surveillance apparatus the government's been hiding.
[00:13:16.977 --> 00:13:18.718]  That from comedian Stephen Colbert.
[00:13:41.313 --> 00:13:42.895]  On PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:13:43.155 --> 00:13:43.716]  So stay tuned.
[00:13:43.736 --> 00:13:46.118]  We'll be right back with David Knight and Dr. William Pepper.
[00:13:51.343 --> 00:13:55.868]  Now you can watch the InfoWars Nightly News streaming live as it happens for free.
[00:13:56.368 --> 00:13:59.592]  Check it out at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:14:06.676 --> 00:14:09.439]  Johnny Appleseed was born during the Revolutionary War.
[00:14:09.499 --> 00:14:10.601]  He's not just a legend.
[00:14:11.001 --> 00:14:17.489]  And in more than five states, he introduced apples that had not even been grown in the colonies.
[00:14:18.129 --> 00:14:25.978]  Later, the seeds from plants he planted and cultivated, and some of the varieties he developed, spread across the United States.
[00:14:26.579 --> 00:14:38.385]  And it was Johnny Appleseed teaching the colonists, and then the new Americans after we won independence, the love of planting fruit trees that introduced that idea to North America.
[00:14:39.105 --> 00:14:55.093]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is a revolutionary act to unplug from the television, to unplug from the computer, and all the globalist propaganda, and to go out in your backyard, or your front yard, or planters at your apartment, or on the roof of the building where you live, and to plant a garden.
[00:14:55.353 --> 00:15:04.224]  Become the Johnny Appleseed of your community with seeds from the InfoWars Seed Center at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:15:04.525 --> 00:15:12.995]  The simple act of planting fruits and vegetables and then tending them and taking care of them and then sharing them with friends and family
[00:15:13.736 --> 00:15:16.139]  is a revolutionary act against tyranny.
[00:15:16.459 --> 00:15:22.106]  The globalists first and foremost do not want us to be self-sufficient.
[00:15:22.586 --> 00:15:30.635]  The crony anti-free market capitalist, the fascists, are using socialism and collectivism to shut down societies.
[00:15:31.176 --> 00:15:32.718]  Stalin in Poland
[00:15:33.218 --> 00:15:43.432]  And in Ukraine and other areas, starved on record more than 10 million people over five years by not letting them grow their own crops and collectivizing them.
[00:15:43.873 --> 00:15:49.240]  Now killed between 65 million and 80 plus million people doing the same thing.
[00:15:49.901 --> 00:15:52.043]  The UN says they will use food as a weapon.
[00:15:52.243 --> 00:15:55.366]  They use genetic evil to attack the Earth.
[00:15:55.887 --> 00:16:06.476]  And major GMO companies have been caught going into growth belts around the world, even where GMO is illegal, and planting seeds everywhere to infect the genetics of the original crops.
[00:16:06.917 --> 00:16:12.382]  Almost all of the thousands of varieties of Mexican corn has been infected.
[00:16:13.717 --> 00:16:16.039]  They are in a genetic war against everyone.
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:20.584]  That's why we have to get these seeds and not just plant them on our own gardens.
[00:16:20.924 --> 00:16:26.009]  And not just give them as gifts to friends and family to plant spring and summer and fall gardens.
[00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:33.096]  I'm calling on you to go out into the green belts, to go out into the areas and plant secret gardens.
[00:16:33.837 --> 00:16:43.725]  No, not of marijuana, but of the hundreds and hundreds of incredible high-quality vegetables and herbs and fruit plants that are here.
[00:16:44.305 --> 00:16:46.367]  Lemons and oranges, the list goes on and on.
[00:16:46.687 --> 00:16:47.488]  They will grow.
[00:16:47.728 --> 00:16:51.271]  Plum trees, grape trees, they will grow almost everywhere in the US.
[00:16:51.671 --> 00:16:52.812]  We can literally
[00:16:53.392 --> 00:16:57.615]  Not just buying these products from infowarestore.com, but from wherever you get them.
[00:16:58.036 --> 00:17:02.839]  This aggressive program literally just came to me one morning when I woke up about 4 a.m.
[00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:11.386]  realizing that we've got to counter their genetic war against us with original, real crops developed over eons on this planet.
[00:17:11.966 --> 00:17:13.828]  We have the lowest prices.
[00:17:13.868 --> 00:17:21.295]  We bought it in the biggest bulk that some of these companies have ever seen to ship this directly to you from the InfoWars Command Center.
[00:17:21.676 --> 00:17:22.737]  We stand for life.
[00:17:23.297 --> 00:17:24.278]  We stand for liberty.
[00:17:24.318 --> 00:17:25.880]  We stand for self-sufficiency.
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:31.906]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com, click on the Seed Center, and as of taping this, we have the seven
[00:17:32.446 --> 00:17:33.887]  Top respected brands.
[00:17:34.167 --> 00:17:41.971]  We intend to continue to do research and find other companies, other specialties, other varieties to really take action.
[00:17:42.391 --> 00:17:48.515]  The InfoWars Store Seed Center has the largest online selection of heirloom non-GMO seeds.
[00:17:48.775 --> 00:17:52.317]  Check out these products from our newest supplier, Heirloom Organics.
[00:17:52.577 --> 00:17:55.098]  The Medicine Garden, for a natural remedy.
[00:17:55.338 --> 00:18:00.040]  The Tea Garden, that contains every important tea herb you can grow.
[00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:02.200]  Fruit Lovers, with 12 varieties.
[00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:06.002]  And the Tobacco Pack, additive and pesticide free.
[00:18:06.402 --> 00:18:11.584]  Join the gardening revolution today, at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:18:12.264 --> 00:18:14.485]  This is a revolutionary action we're asking you to take.
[00:18:15.325 --> 00:18:16.945]  Plant seeds everywhere today.
[00:18:17.386 --> 00:18:17.906]  Nurture them.
[00:18:18.886 --> 00:18:21.789]  Bring them to fruit and pass on the knowledge to others.
[00:18:22.229 --> 00:18:23.210]  Become human again.
[00:18:23.771 --> 00:18:25.752]  Discover your roots in the soil.
[00:18:26.413 --> 00:18:30.256]  And remember, the revolution against tyranny is growing.
[00:18:40.245 --> 00:18:42.187]  Our guest for tonight is Dr. William Pepper.
[00:18:42.588 --> 00:18:44.910]  Dr. Pepper has been involved in cases
[00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:47.481]  Okay, it's good to be with you.
[00:18:47.661 --> 00:18:50.443]  It's always important to follow the story wherever it leads.
[00:19:10.709 --> 00:19:17.551]  You followed this case for the Martin Luther King assassination for about 10 years before you had the retrial.
[00:19:17.591 --> 00:19:18.852]  It was actually a mock trial.
[00:19:18.892 --> 00:19:21.232]  Tell us what the conclusion was of that trial.
[00:19:22.953 --> 00:19:28.034]  Well, the retrial, we brought a civil action.
[00:19:28.054 --> 00:19:36.077]  I brought a civil action on behalf of the King family against Lloyd Jowers and others who were involved in the assassination of Martin King.
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:38.081]  I don't know.
[00:19:55.767 --> 00:20:02.313]  And so it enabled the King family finally to have closure in terms of that situation.
[00:20:02.333 --> 00:20:15.345]  It took the jury 59 minutes after hearing testimony over 30 days, it took them 59 minutes to come back with a verdict finding Jowers and the defendants.
[00:20:15.966 --> 00:20:21.811]  And we had unnamed members of federal, state, and local government.
[00:20:22.512 --> 00:20:26.896]  Tell us who they found were responsible.
[00:20:44.694 --> 00:20:45.855]  I'm sorry, who they found what?
[00:20:46.135 --> 00:20:49.797]  Who did they believe was responsible for the assassination of Dr. King?
[00:20:49.837 --> 00:21:03.346]  Well, yeah, they believed that it was a wide-ranging conspiracy, and on the basis of the evidence that came up, that he was killed by a single shot fired by a sniper.
[00:21:04.286 --> 00:21:13.273]  Who was in the bushes behind the cafe called Jim's Grill, was owned by the principal defendant, Lloyd Jowers.
[00:21:13.833 --> 00:21:24.201]  Jowers had admitted that he played a role in the assassination of Martin King, and so there wasn't much question about that.
[00:21:25.342 --> 00:21:27.984]  There was a military team there, Alpha 184 team there.
[00:21:29.965 --> 00:21:30.625]  I think so.
[00:21:49.697 --> 00:21:56.143]  Leave Memphis because he was going to bring half a million people to Washington and in this poor people's march and campaign.
[00:21:56.163 --> 00:21:57.365]  They were not going to march.
[00:21:57.625 --> 00:22:06.293]  They were going to stay there and visit their congressmen and senators and press for a return to funding for social programs.
[00:22:06.733 --> 00:22:10.457]  So they weren't the military knew they didn't have.
[00:22:11.127 --> 00:22:11.547]  I think so.
[00:22:28.001 --> 00:22:33.565]  Well, now you're involved in actually trying to get the case of Sirhan Sirhan reopened as well.
[00:22:33.585 --> 00:22:37.788]  A lot of people believe that they've seen this on television reports.
[00:22:37.928 --> 00:22:39.449]  It's an open and shut case.
[00:22:39.489 --> 00:22:44.032]  Sirhan Sirhan walks up to Robert Kennedy and shoots him, but that's not exactly what happened.
[00:22:44.072 --> 00:22:46.914]  Tell us what happened as far as your evidence goes.
[00:22:47.695 --> 00:22:49.696]  No, it's certainly not what happened.
[00:22:50.097 --> 00:22:55.200]  Sirhan was set up to be a distraction.
[00:22:55.821 --> 00:22:56.141]  He was
[00:22:58.041 --> 00:22:58.421]  I think so.
[00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:27.096]  Most people don't realize that these programs go back to at least the mid-fifties.
[00:23:27.156 --> 00:23:32.542]  Actually, earlier than that, it was after the result of these programs that Dr. Frank Olson died.
[00:23:32.582 --> 00:23:37.167]  He had already been involved in the mid-fifties in a lot of mind control experiments and that sort of thing.
[00:23:37.187 --> 00:23:40.531]  So it goes back probably to the forties at some point in time.
[00:23:41.747 --> 00:23:54.978]  Well, there was a lot of concern during the Cold War that the Soviets were getting involved with mind control and brainwashing, and there was shock at the degree of
[00:23:55.897 --> 00:23:56.417]  All right.
[00:24:13.582 --> 00:24:14.323]  I think so.
[00:24:31.798 --> 00:24:32.279]  Thank you.
[00:24:49.517 --> 00:24:59.846]  What happened was it got off two shots in the front of the senator, and then his arm was pinned to the steam table by a number of people who jumped on him.
[00:24:59.906 --> 00:25:03.249]  So he had no control over his gun after the second shot.
[00:25:04.329 --> 00:25:08.793]  And he kept pulling the trigger robotically with his hand on the table, and the bullets went all over the pantry.
[00:25:09.254 --> 00:25:14.838]  Bob was killed by—this distraction allowed him to be killed by—
[00:25:16.304 --> 00:25:33.658]  A pro, a professional assassin, who would knelt down behind him and put three bullets, two into his coat and body, and one just behind his right ear, which killed the brain, and a fourth bullet went through a shoulder pad.
[00:25:33.938 --> 00:25:35.360]  They were all powder burn range.
[00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:37.742]  They were very close and fired at an upward angle.
[00:25:38.342 --> 00:25:45.228]  There is no question that Serhan, who was in front, and we had a dozen witnesses who testified, they saw him in front.
[00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:57.800]  So to recap, Sirhan is standing in front firing horizontally whereas Kennedy is... and he only gets off two shots before they pin his hand down.
[00:25:58.541 --> 00:26:05.288]  Kennedy is killed with three shots from the back and a fourth that passes through his jacket from the back at an upward angle.
[00:26:05.428 --> 00:26:07.971]  Now how did they convict Sirhan?
[00:26:09.152 --> 00:26:18.523]  Well, basically, his lawyer through the case, I mean, Grant Cooper was his lawyer.
[00:26:18.603 --> 00:26:23.810]  Cooper was himself under indictment, under a federal indictment.
[00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:29.393]  And so they had all the leverage in the world on Sir Hans Counsel, because they had him under indictment.
[00:26:30.253 --> 00:26:31.674]  And he threw the case.
[00:26:31.714 --> 00:26:33.875]  He agreed to the state's ballistic evidence.
[00:26:33.915 --> 00:26:39.117]  He never challenged any of it, even though two of the bullets were not actual bullets in evidence.
[00:26:39.137 --> 00:26:40.118]  They were fabricated.
[00:26:40.138 --> 00:26:40.838]  That's right.
[00:26:41.018 --> 00:26:47.061]  You say in your movement for retrial, you said there were substitute bullets admitted as evidence in place of real bullets.
[00:26:47.701 --> 00:26:48.662]  Tell us a little bit about that.
[00:26:49.676 --> 00:26:57.840]  Yeah, we know that's the case because there was a commission, the Wenke Commission, that looked at the ballistics evidence in 1973.
[00:26:58.581 --> 00:27:04.704]  And at the bottom of the inventory page, they received this evidence from the clerk of the court.
[00:27:05.384 --> 00:27:16.870]  And the bullets they received from the clerk of the court at the bottom of the page had particular notations that were on the base of the bullet.
[00:27:19.871 --> 00:27:30.179]  And the notations that were on those bullets that they received were different from the notations that were put on the bullets by the doctors who removed them.
[00:27:30.799 --> 00:27:35.243]  One from a victim in Goldstein, and the other was the Kennedy neck bullet.
[00:27:36.062 --> 00:27:48.469]  And so the notations on those bullets that they had at the trial were different than the notation that the coroner, the medical examiner, and the hospital doctor put on the actual bullets.
[00:27:48.489 --> 00:27:49.849]  So they introduced the Rome bullets.
[00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:57.033]  They also did, but they didn't object to the state's whole case of the ballistics case.
[00:27:57.554 --> 00:28:01.796]  They claimed they were only there to try to save Sirhan's life.
[00:28:03.557 --> 00:28:08.838]  And avoid the death penalty and all of that, which they didn't do.
[00:28:08.859 --> 00:28:19.743]  He was given the death penalty, found guilty, given the death penalty, and if it hadn't been found unconstitutional in California, he would have been executed, and that would have been the end of that story.
[00:28:20.463 --> 00:28:31.287]  Well, it's important to follow this up, because not only do we not want to see the innocent condemned for crimes of other people, but we really want to know, just as in the case of Martin Luther King, we want to know who's behind these sorts of things.
[00:28:32.603 --> 00:28:32.843]  Yeah.
[00:28:33.564 --> 00:28:41.312]  Well, I mean, the road lead, for the most part, to agents of the federal government.
[00:28:41.532 --> 00:28:50.801]  These become people who are so undesirable in terms of the ruling forces in the society that they have to be eliminated.
[00:28:51.241 --> 00:28:52.743]  They don't kill everybody.
[00:28:52.763 --> 00:28:57.047]  They don't kill all people who are involved in dissenting advocacy and work.
[00:28:57.665 --> 00:29:07.796]  But if a person gets in a position where he is so dangerous, potentially dangerous to them, and they can't control him.
[00:29:08.276 --> 00:29:09.378]  Jack Kennedy, for example.
[00:29:09.398 --> 00:29:12.321]  Jack Kennedy became unmanageable.
[00:29:12.901 --> 00:29:16.946]  There was no way they could control him, get him to do what they wanted him to do.
[00:29:17.566 --> 00:29:18.447]  We're good to go.
[00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:48.642]  He was making enemies right and left, and they couldn't control him.
[00:29:49.002 --> 00:29:56.385]  This is why I think people have to be so concerned about what we see happening with the NSA, what they're doing to politicians.
[00:29:57.185 --> 00:30:02.767]  Even if they're going to use it as a coup to get somebody out if they don't kill the person?
[00:30:04.031 --> 00:30:09.295]  It's still something that everybody should be concerned about, even if it's not being used against them directly.
[00:30:09.815 --> 00:30:14.538]  If it's being used to change the government subversively, that should be everybody's concern.
[00:30:14.558 --> 00:30:17.160]  But, you know, you might wind up being the next Sirhan Sirhan.
[00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:22.063]  You might wind up being the next Patsy that they decide to blame their assassination on.
[00:30:22.143 --> 00:30:26.286]  You never know what's going to happen, especially when they know every detail of your life.
[00:30:26.626 --> 00:30:32.830]  And if they've got total data control, they can basically insert information about you that fits their narrative.
[00:30:34.505 --> 00:30:37.948]  Yeah, I think all of that is a fear.
[00:30:39.369 --> 00:30:46.714]  There was also, in the Sirhan Sirhan case, there was also some new evidence that came to light in 2004 about the audio.
[00:30:47.254 --> 00:30:48.235]  Tell us a little bit about that.
[00:30:50.617 --> 00:31:00.164]  There was a tape recording that was made by a young researcher, journalist, and until 2005 there wasn't the capability
[00:31:03.655 --> 00:31:09.019]  There was not the capability to do a computer analysis of that tape recording.
[00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:12.982]  So, it lay there.
[00:31:13.443 --> 00:31:25.572]  But Phil Von Praag, who is an expert and a specialist in this area, was able to do that and he analyzed it and he showed that there were 13 bullets fired from two different directions and two different guns.
[00:31:26.292 --> 00:31:28.954]  And that scientifically is conclusive.
[00:31:29.275 --> 00:31:31.176]  He said there were 13 bullets fired.
[00:31:32.097 --> 00:31:32.257]  Wow.
[00:31:33.504 --> 00:31:36.686]  It would have been enough if people would have just looked at the ballistic evidence.
[00:31:36.726 --> 00:31:46.290]  As you mentioned, the defender was actually being blackmailed, essentially under prosecution for something else, and he didn't really look at the ballistic evidence.
[00:31:46.810 --> 00:31:54.994]  The fact that only two shots were even fired in Kennedy's direction by Sirhan Sirhan, and he was shot with three shots from the back, that should have been sufficient.
[00:31:55.434 --> 00:32:00.977]  But with this new evidence in 2004 showing that there was actually 13 gunshots, and of course
[00:32:01.557 --> 00:32:04.438]  Sirhan Sirhan's gun only held eight shots.
[00:32:04.958 --> 00:32:08.520]  It seems like that would be enough for them to open up the case.
[00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:18.844]  The fact that there was some prima facie or ridiculous aspects about the initial ballistics as well as this new evidence that came to light with the audio tape.
[00:32:19.444 --> 00:32:24.386]  So you filed this movement to get a new trial for Sirhan Sirhan about a year ago.
[00:32:24.466 --> 00:32:26.247]  Tell us where this is at this moment.
[00:32:28.948 --> 00:32:30.829]  Well I guess we've been involved
[00:32:31.611 --> 00:32:40.035]  Um, in making application to the court, uh, which has gone on for about, uh, procedurally for about two years.
[00:32:40.055 --> 00:32:58.082]  Um, and we, um, we're trying to get, there's a magistrate who advises the judge and they, um, late in the day have changed judges, uh, on us, um, and the magistrate's report
[00:32:59.188 --> 00:33:06.131]  Uh, that has come out, has indicated, um, that the petition should be, um, dismissed.
[00:33:06.991 --> 00:33:07.972]  It's not a surprise.
[00:33:07.992 --> 00:33:15.715]  I mean, this has been the position of the, uh, of the court in the state basically forever on this case.
[00:33:15.735 --> 00:33:21.077]  Uh, they try to keep the case admired and procedural.
[00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:23.711]  Issues rather than dealing with the merits.
[00:33:24.131 --> 00:33:24.331]  Right.
[00:33:24.891 --> 00:33:26.372]  And the facts of actual innocence.
[00:33:26.412 --> 00:33:28.492]  That's how they prolong these cases forever.
[00:33:29.293 --> 00:33:31.053]  Well, that's the situation we're in.
[00:33:31.073 --> 00:33:32.514]  Yeah, it's still important.
[00:33:32.814 --> 00:33:34.474]  You've brought this to the public attention.
[00:33:35.194 --> 00:33:44.918]  And people are still hearing the evidence, even if it's not going to be formally tried in a court, it's still important that you pull this together, you summarize this for people, and you're still getting the story out there.
[00:33:44.978 --> 00:33:45.778]  So that's good.
[00:33:47.543 --> 00:33:59.151]  Well, if the judge follows the magistrate's recommendation, and if she really reads the file and the evidence, she should not, of course.
[00:33:59.731 --> 00:34:07.757]  But if she does, then we expect that we will go to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.
[00:34:08.377 --> 00:34:14.061]  The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that actual innocents must
[00:34:14.964 --> 00:34:42.337]  uh... supersede take precedence over uh... any procedural defects in the case so i think uh... within the ninth circuit is is with us on this we're in you know we're we think the evidence is so strong that a reasonable juror could not have found Sirhan guilty so we believe we're all right with that the supreme court has
[00:34:43.087 --> 00:34:43.467]  I think so.
[00:35:08.034 --> 00:35:11.956]  Well, I think they have a pretty strong case.
[00:35:11.976 --> 00:35:16.139]  I think they have a pretty strong case even if they don't look at the new audio.
[00:35:17.088 --> 00:35:19.370]  Information, which itself is very strong.
[00:35:19.390 --> 00:35:25.775]  The fact that he's firing from the front horizontally and only two shots were even fired in that direction by him.
[00:35:26.215 --> 00:35:30.558]  And then you've got the fact that he was hit by three shots point-blank from the back at an upward angle.
[00:35:30.598 --> 00:35:37.364]  That's just amazing that that got through the justice system, but we all know how things like that can be gamed.
[00:35:37.464 --> 00:35:44.069]  Tell us about another case that you're getting involved in that also dates back to that same time, the case of Mary Meyer.
[00:35:46.204 --> 00:35:55.148]  Yeah, Mary Meyer, in many ways, is as or more interesting than the assassination cases of the Kennedy brothers and Martin King.
[00:35:55.908 --> 00:36:01.770]  Mary Meyer was the only woman Jack Kennedy ever loved.
[00:36:01.850 --> 00:36:03.971]  I think that's become now pretty clear.
[00:36:04.451 --> 00:36:11.314]  He was going to marry her after the second term, as we told Kenny O'Donnell.
[00:36:12.094 --> 00:36:12.634]  I think so, yes.
[00:36:42.821 --> 00:36:50.963]  She was turning the President clearly in the path of peace and making him, what the military called, unmanageable.
[00:36:52.083 --> 00:36:58.505]  When they killed Jack Kennedy, she waited until the Warren Commission report came out.
[00:36:59.465 --> 00:37:07.707]  She was devastated by the fact that, of course, it covered up what really happened, and she went to her ex-husband.
[00:37:07.747 --> 00:37:11.248]  She had been married to Cord Meyer, a deputy director of the CIA.
[00:37:12.422 --> 00:37:12.482]  I'm
[00:37:29.775 --> 00:37:46.903]  I've agreed to represent Peter as his counsel, and I'm working with him on a strategy to try to bring all of the evidence that he has uncovered and put in that book before a court and a jury.
[00:37:47.243 --> 00:37:48.624]  You might want to interview Peter.
[00:37:48.664 --> 00:37:53.646]  You might want to talk to him separately, because he can go over all of these things.
[00:37:53.666 --> 00:37:56.167]  He was close to Mary Meyer as a child.
[00:37:56.527 --> 00:37:57.848]  She was like a surrogate mother.
[00:37:58.488 --> 00:37:58.768]  I think so.
[00:38:17.686 --> 00:38:23.288]  In fact, it was the first one to call Ben Bradley, The Washington Post, and tip Ben off.
[00:38:23.328 --> 00:38:25.589]  Ben Bradley was married to Mary's sister.
[00:38:26.329 --> 00:38:35.712]  So, it's a saga of enormous proportions, and I think it's an unsolved murder.
[00:38:35.792 --> 00:38:45.675]  They did accuse a black fellow who happened to be in the same wooded area at the time, but there was no evidence, no forensic evidence.
[00:38:46.555 --> 00:38:53.877]  And he didn't meet the description given of someone who was standing over the body, and so the jury acquitted him.
[00:38:53.957 --> 00:39:01.799]  So it is a 50-year-old unsolved murder, maybe the most famous unsolved murder in Washington DC history.
[00:39:02.219 --> 00:39:12.602]  Yeah, the description of the murder by eyewitnesses and the physical appearance of this black man had absolutely nothing to do with each other, right?
[00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:13.841]  Absolutely.
[00:39:14.161 --> 00:39:14.341]  Right.
[00:39:14.721 --> 00:39:15.962]  It wasn't even close.
[00:39:16.042 --> 00:39:17.223]  It was a farce.
[00:39:18.184 --> 00:39:18.885]  But they tried.
[00:39:19.265 --> 00:39:31.355]  However, we have identified, Peter has identified and others who work on this case have identified, an individual who was a CIA operative who was there on the scene.
[00:39:35.223 --> 00:39:43.466]  It's an interesting legal challenge as to how to get this matter before a judge and jury, but that's what we're working on.
[00:39:43.927 --> 00:39:44.447]  Absolutely.
[00:39:44.507 --> 00:39:49.709]  Well, I certainly wish you luck on that, and we really appreciate, all of us appreciate
[00:39:50.379 --> 00:39:57.447]  The work that you've done to try to discover the truth, you know, it sometimes takes a very long time for the truth to come out, but it eventually does.
[00:39:57.547 --> 00:40:02.412]  People have guilty consciences about what they've done at earlier times.
[00:40:02.892 --> 00:40:06.016]  Maybe they were intimidated at the time as we're seeing with the
[00:40:06.778 --> 00:40:07.739]  Flight TWA 800.
[00:40:08.299 --> 00:40:11.382]  We have six whistleblowers that have now come forward now that they've retired.
[00:40:11.422 --> 00:40:13.624]  Maybe they're not as concerned about their careers.
[00:40:13.684 --> 00:40:17.368]  Maybe they've had a long time to think about this and they want the truth to come out.
[00:40:17.408 --> 00:40:26.236]  So we see that type of thing happening over and over again with the Oklahoma City bombing, with Flight TWA 800 and with the Martin Luther King assassination.
[00:40:27.256 --> 00:40:41.849]  And it takes people like you who are willing to go against the grain, go against the conventional wisdom, and really have a lot of verbal rocks thrown at them for going up and pointing out that the emperor's story doesn't really have any close to it.
[00:40:44.251 --> 00:40:48.895]  I think that's right, but anyway, we do what we can do, and maybe it'll bear fruit some
[00:40:49.696 --> 00:40:49.816]  Yes.
[00:41:01.375 --> 00:41:05.198]  Ignorance is fertile breeding ground for tyranny, as you know.
[00:41:05.498 --> 00:41:05.999]  Absolutely.
[00:41:06.079 --> 00:41:08.060]  And that's the lesson to take away from this.
[00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:11.222]  I mean, these are things that happened 50, 60 years ago, whatever.
[00:41:11.783 --> 00:41:13.684]  It still has relevance for today.
[00:41:14.265 --> 00:41:19.809]  Because if we don't stop the corruption and if we don't have transparency and openness and honesty in government,
[00:41:20.249 --> 00:41:28.672]  It's really kind of eating away at this country like a cancer and we're seeing the fruits that were sown back in the 60s with these secret assassinations.
[00:41:28.972 --> 00:41:42.577]  We're seeing those fruits sown out today with open drone assassinations and the Department of Homeland Security openly plotting to carry out operations on the American public, buying massive amounts of ammunition, holding
[00:41:43.337 --> 00:41:48.739]  Massive drills in cities at an increasing frequency and getting rid of the Posse Comitatus Law.
[00:41:48.759 --> 00:41:59.041]  We see all of this stuff coming back as a threat to us because we never dealt with the assassinations and the criminal actions as they were happening back in the 60s.
[00:41:59.242 --> 00:42:02.122]  I think that's right.
[00:42:02.542 --> 00:42:04.283]  Well, thank you very much for joining us.
[00:42:04.383 --> 00:42:05.603]  I really appreciate you talking to us.
[00:42:05.623 --> 00:42:06.424]  Thank you, Dr. Pepper.
[00:42:07.244 --> 00:42:07.764]  You're welcome.
[00:42:09.605 --> 00:42:11.646]  Well, when we tolerate corruption, it only gets worse.
[00:42:12.087 --> 00:42:25.515]  And when we tolerate and allow the assassinations that happened in the 60s, when we allow them to cover that up, when we allow them to destroy evidence, as Dr. Peppers pointed out in the Robert Kennedy case, they only get emboldened to do it again and again.
[00:42:26.436 --> 00:42:32.099]  Part of that case, as he was talking about, was the idea that Sirhan Sirhan did not know where he was.
[00:42:32.139 --> 00:42:33.460]  He thought he was at a shooting range.
[00:42:34.289 --> 00:42:36.111]  And said that he had been controlled.
[00:42:36.171 --> 00:42:44.799]  Actually, he had testimony from an expert psychologist who spent a great deal of time with Sirhan Sirhan to ascertain that he was in fact telling the truth about that.
[00:42:44.839 --> 00:42:48.943]  But that's the hardest part of the Sirhan Sirhan story for the public to believe because
[00:42:49.563 --> 00:43:02.119]  So many people in the public just don't want to believe that our government has been pursuing a scientific program that allows them to do mind control and they've been pursuing that for 60, 70 years.
[00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:03.901]  We have a documentary that...
[00:43:04.702 --> 00:43:08.964]  InfoWars is going to be carrying exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:43:09.304 --> 00:43:10.364]  You can pre-book that now.
[00:43:10.384 --> 00:43:15.506]  We're going to have a 90-day window where it is exclusively sold by InfoWars.
[00:43:16.006 --> 00:43:30.152]  It's going to ship in about a month, and if you're one of the first people to order this while supplies last, you'll also get a copy of the American Dream, and it'll show how not just mines are being controlled by the government, but our money supply is.
[00:43:30.772 --> 00:43:42.880]  The American Dream is an animated cartoon that lays out in a very quick and animated fashion how the Federal Reserve controls the money supply and how they put this all together.
[00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:45.241]  So it's a great way for people to wake up.
[00:43:45.321 --> 00:43:46.322]  It's a great product.
[00:43:46.702 --> 00:43:49.143]  And it goes along with the State of Mind for a limited time.
[00:43:49.504 --> 00:43:53.486]  When you pre-book this, you'll get a free copy of American Dream.
[00:43:54.027 --> 00:43:55.147]  Well, that's it for tonight's news.
[00:43:55.167 --> 00:43:57.489]  We'll be back tomorrow at 7 Central, 8 p.m.
[00:43:57.529 --> 00:43:57.849]  Eastern.
