[00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:10.662]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:11.322 --> 00:00:12.123]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.904 --> 00:00:13.804]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.445 --> 00:00:18.047]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.628 --> 00:00:22.711]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.622 --> 00:00:42.928]  They say that when you slow down and really think about nothing, that you clear your mind and really can see the world clearly for what it is.
[00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.330]  And I was able to do that yesterday.
[00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.952]  One of my friends has a boat on Lake Austin.
[00:00:49.794 --> 00:00:54.357]  And so I took my children out on the lake with his children.
[00:00:55.998 --> 00:01:00.202]  And we ran into Rob Lowe's younger brother.
[00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.441]  One of the stars of True Blood.
[00:01:02.481 --> 00:01:03.061]  That was weird.
[00:01:03.882 --> 00:01:08.085]  But other than that, there was almost no one on the lake, which is very rare.
[00:01:08.105 --> 00:01:11.347]  It's really the dammed up Colorado River.
[00:01:11.427 --> 00:01:12.948]  They just call it Lake Austin.
[00:01:12.988 --> 00:01:13.949]  Now it's Lady Bird Lake.
[00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:15.650]  They changed the name every few years.
[00:01:16.451 --> 00:01:16.791]  Why not?
[00:01:16.851 --> 00:01:17.491]  It's really a river.
[00:01:17.512 --> 00:01:18.732]  A lion called it a lake.
[00:01:18.852 --> 00:01:19.793]  Why not tell more lies?
[00:01:19.813 --> 00:01:26.358]  The point is, we're out on the Colorado River, wheels within wheels, and I watched
[00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:33.772]  We're out there about four or five hours and probably saw five boats.
[00:01:34.872 --> 00:01:45.518]  It was deader than when I was a kid when come down here and visit my grandparents and my dad would say let's drive out to Lake Austin that was hillbillies then back in the 80s.
[00:01:45.698 --> 00:01:46.459]  Nobody out there.
[00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:56.084]  Maybe a few fishing shacks and a few mansions on the hill and you would see more boats when I was a little kid on Lake Austin that I saw out there yesterday.
[00:01:56.104 --> 00:01:57.245]  It was the perfect day
[00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.611]  Dead.
[00:01:59.631 --> 00:02:11.123]  And I watched the police drive around and pull over every single boat on the lake.
[00:02:12.543 --> 00:02:15.845]  And people kayaking, they would stop them and have their lights on and do something.
[00:02:16.146 --> 00:02:19.768]  So then they got behind us, and I got up with my iPhone and started filming it.
[00:02:19.788 --> 00:02:23.491]  Because they were bugging their eyes out, you know, with a predatory bearing.
[00:02:23.851 --> 00:02:28.755]  Until they drove right up by the boat and looked at me in the face, and then looked sheepishly and waved and drove off.
[00:02:29.455 --> 00:02:32.217]  And I don't know if they recognized me or what, because I was wearing a fedora.
[00:02:32.898 --> 00:02:34.279]  And with a sun, a straw fedora.
[00:02:35.623 --> 00:02:36.424]  They probably weren't.
[00:02:36.924 --> 00:02:44.690]  It was that I wasn't going to just sit there and roll around the bottom of the boat, begging them that, oh, I'm a criminal, please, please don't get me.
[00:02:47.312 --> 00:02:55.338]  And again, I'm not anti-police, but every day I see videos where they arrest someone filming them even a hundred yards away, not interfering with them.
[00:02:56.719 --> 00:03:03.924]  Or I see video where the cops in the woman's face as she kisses his nose and they slam her to the ground and then arrest her and then charge her with assaulting them.
[00:03:07.458 --> 00:03:17.263]  I saw an article yesterday in the video in another case where they knocked the woman's windows out because she bought LaCroix water.
[00:03:18.763 --> 00:03:19.824]  I drink LaCroix water.
[00:03:20.324 --> 00:03:21.885]  Really good canned water.
[00:03:22.045 --> 00:03:28.068]  I know cans aren't good for you, but I still, if I see it sometimes, I drink it because it's such LaCroix, LaCroix, however you pronounce it.
[00:03:28.928 --> 00:03:33.810]  She's going to a charity event for people with disabilities.
[00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.291]  They've got cookie dough.
[00:03:36.693 --> 00:03:38.514]  And they've also got LaCroix Water.
[00:03:40.235 --> 00:03:44.656]  And she gets in her car, closes the door, they run up screaming with guns, unmarked.
[00:03:45.837 --> 00:03:46.597]  Tell her, get out.
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.800]  Well, first they tell her, roll down the window.
[00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.001]  So she goes to roll down the window, they go, just start the car.
[00:03:56.221 --> 00:03:57.982]  They go, no, don't roll down your window.
[00:03:59.929 --> 00:04:06.131]  And then they tell her to stay where she's at, and then they knock the windows out, and then charge her with assaulting them!
[00:04:06.511 --> 00:04:07.372]  She never touched them!
[00:04:08.012 --> 00:04:10.853]  And it's militarized police is what it is.
[00:04:11.333 --> 00:04:17.275]  Most of them are vets of occupied zones, where they'll just shoot up whole vehicles if somebody looks at them wrong on record.
[00:04:17.796 --> 00:04:21.677]  And they're coming back, and they're not peace officers, they are paramilitary police.
[00:04:21.697 --> 00:04:25.619]  They'll admit this, and we are an occupied country, and this is how we're treated.
[00:04:25.679 --> 00:04:29.040]  And the more slaves they can bag, the better.
[00:04:31.556 --> 00:04:32.656]  And it's really crazy.
[00:04:33.376 --> 00:04:38.778]  As I saw this footage of this guy filming police, looks like he's about 60-70 yards away, broad daylight.
[00:04:39.798 --> 00:04:44.559]  They come over, put him in handcuffs, looks like one of them punches him in the face.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.120]  The guy's dog jumps out of his vehicle and they shoot the dog.
[00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:53.581]  And then they charge the guy with a bunch of stuff.
[00:04:53.661 --> 00:04:56.722]  I mean, this is how they take you to the FEMA camp now, folks.
[00:04:56.922 --> 00:04:58.723]  We have the biggest prison population in the world.
[00:04:59.703 --> 00:05:00.423]  It's very scary.
[00:05:02.097 --> 00:05:11.940]  Now is the perfect time to spring clean your body with Supernatural Silver, a non-toxic disinfectant for the body that can be used internally or externally.

[00:07:01.664 --> 00:07:04.787]  Oklahoma reminds us there are many kinds of storms in our lives.
[00:07:05.147 --> 00:07:07.769]  Nature regularly sends us destructive storms.
[00:07:08.209 --> 00:07:10.751]  24 hours before a storm strikes, people panic.
[00:07:11.031 --> 00:07:14.254]  It would be wise to prepare ahead of the panic curve.
[00:07:14.454 --> 00:07:20.719]  The food price storm from drought and livestock problems is forecast to hit ridiculous heights by the end of the summer.
[00:07:20.999 --> 00:07:22.641]  Wonder if there'll really be a problem?

[00:08:15.103 --> 00:08:20.524]  Can you keep them in the dark for life?
[00:08:20.564 --> 00:08:26.606]  Can you hide them from the waiting world, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:08:39.917 --> 00:08:40.858]  Oh, mother!
[00:08:43.059 --> 00:08:45.361]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:45.521 --> 00:08:50.144]  It is Tuesday, the second day of July, 2013.
[00:08:51.404 --> 00:08:58.589]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and we are going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:08:59.149 --> 00:09:04.733]  My old friend of 15 years, Raymond Teague, is scheduled to be arriving here any minute.
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:14.582]  And he said that he could come on and talk about his experiences as a mission controller on the front line of the Apollo missions.
[00:09:14.602 --> 00:09:19.163]  And he did talk to us a little bit about the NSA and said that I could, you know, talk about some of it that wasn't classified.
[00:09:19.203 --> 00:09:23.024]  But then he called us the other day and said, hey, will you please stop talking about that?
[00:09:23.405 --> 00:09:32.207]  So we'll see what Raymond is able to talk about coming on the broadcast here in about 25 minutes from now.
[00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:43.163]  And then Professor Griff, of course, one of the founders of Public Enemy, who's here in town with LL Cool J and Ice Cube.
[00:09:43.183 --> 00:09:44.625]  He is scheduled.
[00:09:44.645 --> 00:09:47.589]  He's driving down from Dallas right now with the whole crew.
[00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:51.272]  And so we're going to get some interviews with him.
[00:09:51.372 --> 00:09:58.717]  And who knows, tonight I was invited to their show and backstage and stuff, but I have got my wife's birthday tonight, so I will not be at that.
[00:09:58.737 --> 00:10:02.079]  I would love to be there, but I'm sending John Bounds, so we'll see.
[00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:07.003]  Who knows, maybe we'll get some other interesting interviews for you in the next few days.
[00:10:07.023 --> 00:10:12.507]  We'll probably air it next week if we do get an interview with LL Cool J or Ice Cube on their take on the whole New World Order and stuff.
[00:10:13.107 --> 00:10:18.850]  Who I want to get on is Ice-T, who's always pro-Second Amendment, and goes, hey, when the government turns theirs in, I'll turn mine in.
[00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:20.991]  And, hey, Piers, you got bodyguards.
[00:10:21.471 --> 00:10:22.552]  You want them to turn their guns in?
[00:10:23.733 --> 00:10:25.754]  Okay, so when you turn yours in, I'll turn mine in.
[00:10:25.774 --> 00:10:26.254]  How's that sound?
[00:10:26.274 --> 00:10:26.854]  Just real?
[00:10:26.894 --> 00:10:27.995]  That's what Jesse Ventura says.
[00:10:28.315 --> 00:10:28.995]  That's what I say.
[00:10:30.036 --> 00:10:32.457]  The only people that want our guns are gangster government.
[00:10:32.797 --> 00:10:39.361]  And the mark of whether somebody's a good guy or a bad guy, where you start, is are they pro-self-defense?
[00:10:41.823 --> 00:10:43.044]  It's very, very simple.
[00:10:43.184 --> 00:10:49.651]  So that's some of the issues that we're going to be raising and going over.
[00:10:51.193 --> 00:10:59.341]  In the meantime, at the start of the next hour, because I've got Raymond coming up with other news I want to get to now, I'm going to break down foreign troops in America.
[00:11:00.482 --> 00:11:02.744]  And Paul Watson did a story on this.
[00:11:04.031 --> 00:11:08.995]  Yesterday morning that ended up being the top story on DrugsReport.com.
[00:11:09.536 --> 00:11:25.889]  And so it was covered by Michael Savage, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, and I didn't hear if Becky Poo covered it, but we were sent clips by their listeners that people, we don't really listen, we're too busy doing our own news research, but people send us the clips.
[00:11:26.149 --> 00:11:29.592]  I listened to the Savage clip and he had the best analysis of it compared to the others.
[00:11:30.072 --> 00:11:33.095]  But the point is, and that clip's up on Infowars.com,
[00:11:33.675 --> 00:11:36.239]  The point is, I want to explain something to people.
[00:11:36.879 --> 00:11:49.717]  The old-timers of the John Virch Society in the 50s and 60s, and the old-timers who they called extremist crazies, were constantly saying there's a plan to put foreign troops in America.
[00:11:51.101 --> 00:11:52.943]  There's a plan to get rid of our borders.
[00:11:52.963 --> 00:11:55.765]  There's a plan to put you in 200 square foot homes.
[00:11:56.185 --> 00:11:58.307]  There's a plan to break up families.
[00:11:58.347 --> 00:12:00.409]  There's a plan to take our guns.
[00:12:00.449 --> 00:12:02.771]  There's a plan for forced inoculation.
[00:12:03.351 --> 00:12:11.318]  Now, 60 years later, all of this is being phased in or has been phased in.
[00:12:13.219 --> 00:12:13.940]  Remember
[00:12:15.562 --> 00:12:32.751]  Allllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
[00:12:34.949 --> 00:12:38.571]  But then people heard about it, and then, oh, it just became a rumor.
[00:12:38.631 --> 00:12:46.155]  We were going off Congressional hearings, Council on Foreign Relations publications, Club of Rome publications, U.N.
[00:12:46.235 --> 00:12:48.016]  statements, Rockefeller statements.
[00:12:51.258 --> 00:12:52.979]  And that's what's so frustrating about this.
[00:12:53.079 --> 00:13:00.223]  And we said, they're going to implode the world economy, bail out the governments with fiat currency, signing us onto their fake derivatives debts.
[00:13:00.623 --> 00:13:01.683]  I've been saying this for 14, 15 years.
[00:13:03.763 --> 00:13:05.804]  Because it was the plan when they got rid of Glass-Steagall.
[00:13:06.084 --> 00:13:08.144]  I had The Economist on to break it down like George Humphrey.
[00:13:09.925 --> 00:13:22.409]  The issue I'm getting at here is that we've known exactly what's going to happen because they all wrote about it, like the White House science czar in 1974, the year I was born.
[00:13:22.969 --> 00:13:24.589]  He's now the White House science czar.
[00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:28.811]  Wrote it with the former science czar of Bush Sr.
[00:13:31.687 --> 00:13:37.593]  John P. Holdren saying we're going to put stuff in your water to sterilize your butt incrementally.
[00:13:37.613 --> 00:13:41.657]  But not everybody, because we don't want it to be causal where you can find one thing that's doing it.
[00:13:41.998 --> 00:13:43.119]  It's going to be an aggregate
[00:13:44.431 --> 00:13:45.431]  Cocktail effect!
[00:13:46.211 --> 00:14:01.654]  And then all the other books, Bertrand Russell and the rest of them wrote about spiking our water, spiking our food, reducing fertility, how they'd get rid of the family, how they'd do it first by encouraging homosexuality so that there was no definition of man and woman.
[00:14:01.974 --> 00:14:10.536]  Now in the US and Europe they've banned the word husband and wife on government forms because husband and wife is hurtful to people that don't have a husband or wife.
[00:14:10.998 --> 00:14:12.039]  We're already there!
[00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:18.826]  And so it's way past them turning it into some fake civil liberty about, oh, you don't like gay people.
[00:14:19.526 --> 00:14:20.627]  It has nothing to do with that.
[00:14:21.248 --> 00:14:27.354]  I mean, if a frog isn't able to reproduce because it's had chemicals put in the water, is that about gay or heterosexual?
[00:14:30.291 --> 00:14:34.976]  If more and more fish are hermaphroditic, I mean, is that because I'm homophobic, I'm reporting that?
[00:14:35.296 --> 00:14:43.744]  This is the mindlessness of where, you know, they had that teapot, I never really even talked about it, that was simply a teapot with a handle, looked nothing like Hitler.
[00:14:43.764 --> 00:14:47.047]  It's like looking at a cloud and saying it looks like a dinosaur.
[00:14:47.307 --> 00:14:53.994]  If a cloud looked like Hitler to somebody, do we have to send up, you know, the Air Force to spray it with chemicals to dissipate it because it's racist?
[00:14:54.574 --> 00:14:56.695]  All the real tyranny is going on.
[00:14:56.995 --> 00:15:00.937]  We're giving $85 billion a month of taxpayer money to foreign banks to bankrupt us.
[00:15:02.838 --> 00:15:04.299]  Cancer rates are exploding.
[00:15:05.119 --> 00:15:06.800]  All this horrible tyranny is taking place.
[00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:13.143]  We're all losing our rights to habeas corpus, to posse comitatus.
[00:15:13.543 --> 00:15:23.608]  All the basic liberties are being eroded, destroyed, demolished, and people are going into JCPenney and seeing a good-looking teapot.
[00:15:24.807 --> 00:15:31.752]  With a curve and an area for your handle and a round handle on the top that someone imagined looks like Adolf Hitler.
[00:15:34.093 --> 00:15:39.017]  And now a girl's eating a pastry and it looks like the shape of a gun after she took bites out of it.
[00:15:39.277 --> 00:15:42.039]  They've kicked kids out for bringing a gun cookie.
[00:15:42.059 --> 00:15:44.861]  You know, they're making cookies with moms and the boy makes one like a gun.
[00:15:44.921 --> 00:15:45.901]  I did that when I was a kid.
[00:15:45.922 --> 00:15:52.186]  No, no, no, now you're kicked out of school if you're sitting there eating it.
[00:15:54.616 --> 00:15:57.139]  You're sitting there, you're sitting there eating it.
[00:15:59.761 --> 00:16:04.006]  And you lay down the pastry and someone goes, a gun!
[00:16:04.346 --> 00:16:07.149]  And then they want to add into his mind control hysteria.
[00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:08.431]  You're then...
[00:16:11.462 --> 00:16:12.283]  Kicked out of school.
[00:16:13.243 --> 00:16:18.267]  Or you wear an NRA shirt with an NRA seal saying, defend our rights, and you're kicked out.
[00:16:18.787 --> 00:16:24.070]  And then the cops tell you to take the shirt off and you go, there's no rule without, you know, for wearing political shirts in school.
[00:16:25.011 --> 00:16:25.892]  I'm not going to take it off.
[00:16:25.932 --> 00:16:27.833]  So they then charge you with that.
[00:16:28.594 --> 00:16:29.894]  When it's an unlawful order.
[00:16:31.636 --> 00:16:33.757]  The cops can't show up at your house and say, mow your yard.
[00:16:33.977 --> 00:16:37.860]  They can't show up at your house and say, come out here and comb my hair.
[00:16:39.895 --> 00:16:40.535]  And you laugh.
[00:16:40.655 --> 00:16:48.840]  In most third world countries, in most Soviet-style countries, they make you, a few days a week, go do compulsory volunteerism, another Orwellian oxymoron, and do this.
[00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:50.581]  So, at the start of the next hour...
[00:16:51.889 --> 00:16:53.330]  I'm going to get into our article.
[00:16:53.431 --> 00:16:54.752]  It's now on the right-hand side of Drudge.
[00:16:54.812 --> 00:16:58.075]  It's in Top Story Archive of Infowars.com.
[00:16:58.095 --> 00:16:59.296]  Just click on that link.
[00:16:59.677 --> 00:17:02.880]  Russian forces that provide security at U.S.
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:03.360]  events.
[00:17:04.141 --> 00:17:13.591]  Ladies and gentlemen, in NLE09, they had tabletop 15 nations here with military representatives doing drills on tabletops.
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:17.121]  Of how they'd help take over U.S.
[00:17:17.181 --> 00:17:23.223]  cities, quote, during natural disasters or civil emergencies.
[00:17:23.603 --> 00:17:34.607]  And the documents have been in the Washington Post, but like it's a good thing that, oh, we're going to have Mexican and Canadian troops on the streets of America during any emergency or to deal with civil unrest or insurrection.
[00:17:34.867 --> 00:17:38.508]  And then Canada and Mexico reciprocate where we go down there.
[00:17:38.788 --> 00:17:41.309]  And then you saw the Olympics a few years ago, the Winter Olympics.
[00:17:41.989 --> 00:17:43.230]  It was in all the big papers.
[00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:44.030]  U.S.
[00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:47.392]  troops weren't just in the one city where they had the event.
[00:17:47.412 --> 00:17:47.713]  What was it?
[00:17:47.753 --> 00:17:49.013]  Calgary, if I go from memory.
[00:17:49.914 --> 00:17:51.775]  It was in the paper, but like it was good.
[00:17:52.155 --> 00:17:52.475]  U.S.
[00:17:52.515 --> 00:17:54.277]  troops patrolled the Bar District.
[00:17:54.557 --> 00:17:59.240]  And they were all over multi-cities helping run checkpoints.
[00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:03.342]  You don't just get Royal Mounted Police running warrantless checkpoints in Canada.
[00:18:03.902 --> 00:18:05.123]  You get U.S.
[00:18:05.283 --> 00:18:06.564]  Army and U.S.
[00:18:06.604 --> 00:18:09.626]  Marines that were just in Fallujah a few years before.
[00:18:11.946 --> 00:18:28.353]  And you have from Tennessee to California mainstream news articles where the Marines and Army set up checkpoints with 9mm on their hips and with heavy machine guns in the backs of Humvees and search vehicles at highway checkpoints.
[00:18:28.693 --> 00:18:30.374]  It's illegal to have the cops do that.
[00:18:31.494 --> 00:18:32.655]  But they just do it.
[00:18:33.889 --> 00:18:35.311]  Under the civil emergency.
[00:18:35.831 --> 00:18:37.813]  Under the PDD 51.
[00:18:38.154 --> 00:18:40.356]  And Obama has expanded those.
[00:18:40.676 --> 00:18:46.122]  So now, if they can get away with Russians at NORAD and Russians and anti-terror drills they had last year.
[00:18:46.342 --> 00:18:49.666]  And by the way, we publish this stuff with Pentagon press releases.
[00:18:50.871 --> 00:18:51.931]  And FEMA press releases.
[00:18:52.291 --> 00:18:56.032]  And last year, no one would cover it because it was too unbelievable.
[00:18:56.613 --> 00:19:01.134]  People were saying we were making it up until folks in the comments would go, well, wait a minute.
[00:19:01.594 --> 00:19:03.755]  This is on the Pentagon Northcom website.
[00:19:05.495 --> 00:19:17.718]  Just like the Homeland Security ordered two plus million dollars this year of paper targets of children to shoot and called them no more hesitation and said, no, Homeland Security wanted these.
[00:19:18.378 --> 00:19:19.959]  So people trained to kill children.
[00:19:20.854 --> 00:19:21.315]  And women.
[00:19:22.275 --> 00:19:22.936]  And old men.
[00:19:25.298 --> 00:19:27.120]  Because the police aren't police now.
[00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:36.529]  You may still be a good officer yourself individually, but your training, the orthodoxy, on record, is that you are a paramilitary force occupying, and we're insurgents.
[00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:37.891]  And I said that a decade ago.
[00:19:38.171 --> 00:19:40.653]  That was in the Wall Street Journal a month ago.
[00:19:40.693 --> 00:19:41.474]  I saw the headline.
[00:19:41.694 --> 00:19:43.796]  Police trained at the public are insurgents.
[00:19:44.622 --> 00:19:45.543]  That's what it is.
[00:19:46.043 --> 00:19:48.405]  It's insurgent occupation training.
[00:19:48.745 --> 00:19:49.245]  Okay?
[00:19:49.526 --> 00:19:51.987]  They're not going to have parachutes in Red Dawn one day.
[00:19:52.267 --> 00:19:55.510]  They're just going to have more and more foreign troops until you're totally used to it.
[00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:57.671]  And our cops go to countries to arrest people.
[00:19:57.912 --> 00:19:58.832]  Their cops come here.
[00:19:59.132 --> 00:20:00.794]  Welcome to the New World Order.
[00:20:02.279 --> 00:20:05.402]  Oklahoma reminds us there are many kinds of storms in our lives.
[00:20:05.742 --> 00:20:08.364]  Nature regularly sends us destructive storms.
[00:20:09.025 --> 00:20:11.367]  24 hours before a storm strikes, people panic.
[00:20:11.627 --> 00:20:14.890]  It would be wise to prepare ahead of the panic curve.
[00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:21.316]  The food price storm from drought and livestock problems is forecast to hit ridiculous heights by the end of the summer.
[00:20:21.596 --> 00:20:23.259]  Wonder if there will really be a problem?

[00:21:02.754 --> 00:21:07.076]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:21:07.236 --> 00:21:12.858]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:21:12.958 --> 00:21:16.300]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[00:23:00.714 --> 00:23:07.683]  There's a huge and hushed up conspiracy going on that's about to turn your lives upside down in the coming few months.
[00:23:08.764 --> 00:23:11.828]  Unbelievably, the media are keeping quiet about this.
[00:23:12.449 --> 00:23:18.256]  I'm sure they know it, but they probably know that revealing it on TV will generate mass hysteria and chaos.
[00:23:19.107 --> 00:23:29.643]  But I believe you should be informed about it, because when the sinister agenda is finally accomplished and everything unravels, only those who know this secret info will survive and thrive.
[00:23:30.324 --> 00:23:34.470]  Go to 123conspiracy.com right now to see the truth.
[00:23:35.191 --> 00:23:43.358]  The video at 123conspiracy.com reveals the real, secret reason why Obama is after your guns and ammo.
[00:23:43.878 --> 00:23:47.301]  And it's not just in response to mass murders or preparing for war.
[00:23:47.721 --> 00:23:49.683]  It's something much darker.
[00:23:50.163 --> 00:23:55.448]  Go watch the video now at 123conspiracy.com before they shut it down.
[00:23:55.848 --> 00:23:57.189]  Again, that's 123conspiracy.com.
[00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:08.404]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:09.084 --> 00:24:11.426]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:25.076 --> 00:24:31.520]  By the way, President Obama told young Africans this video is now breaking via CNS News.
[00:24:33.817 --> 00:24:38.741]  That you shouldn't be able to have air conditioning, big houses, and cars.
[00:24:39.402 --> 00:24:49.530]  No, you've just got to have Air Force One and have over 3,000 aircraft for military brass and Congress to fly around on, and Air Force Two that cost hundreds of millions a year to run.
[00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:55.555]  And one night per hotel for Obama and his entourage is a million dollars, conservatively.
[00:24:56.356 --> 00:24:59.418]  On average, they get three, four, five, six, and even $10,000 a night hotel rooms.
[00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:04.823]  I guarantee you, if I was the president, I wouldn't be doing things like this.
[00:25:05.263 --> 00:25:10.648]  But again, Michelle Obama is out in the news saying that she feels like she lives in a really nice prison.
[00:25:11.289 --> 00:25:15.472]  Well, yeah, because they spent two billion dollars putting this puppet in there.
[00:25:16.614 --> 00:25:18.095]  He's owned by the globalist.
[00:25:19.917 --> 00:25:22.239]  And so he's an important teleprompter reader.
[00:25:22.659 --> 00:25:24.481]  So of course they're going to put you in a gilded cage.
[00:25:25.794 --> 00:25:26.535]  But it's more than that.
[00:25:26.575 --> 00:25:34.121]  It's about having all the pomp and circumstance and red carpets so that people actually believe the buck stops with El Presidente.
[00:25:34.161 --> 00:25:47.533]  But just as Maurice Strong swore, the head of the United Nations UNESCO program at the time, in Rio de Janeiro 20 years ago, that they would create a post-industrial world, a Hunger Games world,
[00:25:48.763 --> 00:25:57.686]  Where the elite live in fabulous high-tech splendor with live extension technologies, and you live at starvation level, and when you go above a certain calorie level, you're sent off to be killed.
[00:25:57.966 --> 00:25:59.167]  That's what they're proposing.
[00:25:59.207 --> 00:26:00.247]  That's Logan's run.
[00:26:00.567 --> 00:26:01.528]  That's eugenics.
[00:26:01.988 --> 00:26:06.050]  They're now calling for calorie taxes across the board here in the U.S.
[00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:07.390]  after beta testing.
[00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:11.692]  You've got to have a smart card that tracks everywhere you go with the new VAT
[00:26:12.612 --> 00:26:14.153]  Slash sales tax system.
[00:26:14.413 --> 00:26:15.394]  This is the plan!
[00:26:15.414 --> 00:26:19.596]  100 trillion a year in carbon calorie taxes.
[00:26:19.956 --> 00:26:23.798]  Taxing everything from your food, to water, to transportation.
[00:26:24.439 --> 00:26:25.919]  Paid to private banks.
[00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:28.081]  Watch the Obama deception.
[00:26:28.361 --> 00:26:28.861]  Part 1.
[00:26:29.241 --> 00:26:30.142]  Five years old.
[00:26:30.882 --> 00:26:33.144]  And everything I said, Obama did.
[00:26:33.204 --> 00:26:34.885]  It came out right when he was elected.
[00:26:35.225 --> 00:26:40.249]  I said he'll break all his promises, and he'll do A through Z, and exactly what I told you he did.
[00:26:40.810 --> 00:26:42.471]  Because I've got their playbook.
[00:26:42.711 --> 00:26:46.914]  It's like I'm the New England Patriots, and I stole the playbook of the Steelers.
[00:26:47.655 --> 00:26:49.336]  Man, I know what they're going to do!
[00:26:49.356 --> 00:26:51.438]  This is not my opinion.
[00:26:52.599 --> 00:26:54.820]  Obama's Africa trip will cost $100 million.
[00:26:58.619 --> 00:27:11.034]  100 million dollars, and again, the global mega banks, the global mega rich, they have given over 100,000 different people, last time I checked, total diplomatic immunity.
[00:27:11.514 --> 00:27:14.578]  Their friends, their families, you name it, just from the UN.
[00:27:15.038 --> 00:27:19.163]  Now they're getting diplomatic immunity for big banks that are part of the carbon trading scandal.
[00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:20.921]  Above the law!
[00:27:21.121 --> 00:27:22.122]  They pay none of this.
[00:27:22.182 --> 00:27:23.202]  They do none of this.
[00:27:23.743 --> 00:27:25.104]  They can do whatever they want.
[00:27:25.364 --> 00:27:31.729]  It's taxes on you to them to say that our exhaling, our carbon dioxide is hurting the earth.
[00:27:31.969 --> 00:27:32.910]  Let's go to a clip.
[00:27:33.883 --> 00:27:54.131]  Of Obama telling people that live some of the poorest in the world, some of the most wealthy in Africa and in South Africa, but still in the top percent of poorest people, or you say the lowest percent, telling them it's bad for you to have anything nice because you're going to burn the earth up when carbon dioxide has nothing to do with that.
[00:27:54.371 --> 00:27:56.332]  And it's been a proven hoax and a fraud.
[00:27:57.492 --> 00:27:59.233]  Is Obama worried about genetic engineering?
[00:27:59.293 --> 00:27:59.673]  Open air?
[00:28:00.093 --> 00:28:01.774]  Is he worried about all the toxic waste dumping?
[00:28:02.115 --> 00:28:02.535]  Is he worried?
[00:28:02.555 --> 00:28:04.216]  You ever hear about any of the real threats?
[00:28:05.957 --> 00:28:11.600]  Thousands of different crops with live pharmacological viruses and things being created.
[00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:16.983]  They have crops that grow the vaccines, that grow the medicines, that grow the AIDS virus.
[00:28:17.203 --> 00:28:17.583]  Look it up.
[00:28:18.003 --> 00:28:22.226]  Look up corn crops that grow AIDS vaccine, and then it's an AIDS virus in it.
[00:28:23.466 --> 00:28:24.487]  It's Twilight Zone.
[00:28:25.643 --> 00:28:30.347]  But none of that's a threat, crossing humans with animals, to then grow organs in animals for humans.
[00:28:32.328 --> 00:28:43.877]  All of this happening, brain transplants, all of it, with mutagenic properties, and we, ladies and gentlemen, are not supposed to talk about it.
[00:28:44.437 --> 00:28:50.802]  Now there it is, mutated GM maize on a loose, baby carrying AIDS virus, there you go, Aaron Dykes wrote about that last year.
[00:28:51.102 --> 00:28:52.403]  Let's go to this clip of Obama,
[00:28:54.232 --> 00:28:59.593]  The guy exempt from everything, above the law, telling you that you shouldn't be able to have a car.
[00:28:59.653 --> 00:29:00.114]  Here it is.
[00:29:00.154 --> 00:29:13.377]  The youth that everybody's mentioned here in Africa, if everybody's raising living standards to the point where everybody's got a car, and everybody's got air conditioning, and everybody's got a big house, well, the planet will boil over.
[00:29:14.648 --> 00:29:16.909]  Unless we find new ways of producing energy.
[00:29:18.109 --> 00:29:21.150]  And what that means is they are transferring it.
[00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:23.590]  Now then he says, oh, new energy sounds great.
[00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:33.533]  Then you just give it to insider buddies who never even get an office space, never build any of it, while they block all the real new energy systems that have been developed.
[00:29:34.493 --> 00:29:42.215]  They're just cutting off the resources as a total act of domination and selling the idea that progress is bad and that we've got to have austerity.
[00:29:43.323 --> 00:29:44.625]  Unbelievable.
[00:29:44.885 --> 00:29:47.168]  Control of energy is control of everything.
[00:29:47.368 --> 00:29:49.690]  The power to tax is the power to destroy.
[00:29:51.052 --> 00:29:51.953]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.454 --> 00:29:54.055]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.976 --> 00:29:57.659]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:32:01.229 --> 00:32:05.815]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[00:32:05.955 --> 00:32:08.919]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[00:32:09.079 --> 00:32:14.325]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[00:32:14.646 --> 00:32:16.248]  It all comes down to one thing.
[00:32:16.568 --> 00:32:17.889]  We are what we eat.
[00:32:18.189 --> 00:32:22.533]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[00:32:22.873 --> 00:32:26.856]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[00:32:27.097 --> 00:32:29.418]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[00:32:29.659 --> 00:32:35.583]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[00:33:04.588 --> 00:33:07.572]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:33:08.173 --> 00:33:12.298]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:40.509 --> 00:33:45.153]  Yeah, the only people that don't pay to play are the globalists, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:45.834 --> 00:33:56.362]  They're the ones who ride for free off of all of us, and they publicly, in the fifties, sixties, and seventies, put out the Club of Rome documents, Council on Foreign Relations documents.
[00:33:56.863 --> 00:34:03.809]  I cover it all in my film, What is the Endgame dot com, is the bibliography of that film, now seven years old, where I show
[00:34:04.409 --> 00:34:20.320]  How they were going to establish a post-industrial world on calories and energy consumption, and that they would produce the fear stimulus to create a guilt complex, and they said, do we say it's an ice age, or do we say it's because it's too hot, or that we're going to lose our atmosphere?
[00:34:20.761 --> 00:34:26.805]  And they looked at all of these, and they decided, and you can go to any library and pull up the Club of Rum Quarterly's,
[00:34:28.757 --> 00:34:29.898]  1962, you name it.
[00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:37.329]  I have screenshots of this and they settled on whatever the warming trend or cooling trend is, we'll go with that.
[00:34:37.969 --> 00:34:45.300]  If a hurricane hits, if a tornado hits, if it's getting colder, if it's getting hotter, we'll say it was because of mankind.
[00:34:47.426 --> 00:34:58.190]  Because the witch doctors in every culture, I don't care if it was Mesoamerica, Africa, Asia, the Druids in Europe, I don't care if it was the Vikings in Northern Europe all the way into Russia.
[00:34:58.470 --> 00:34:59.830]  Russia's really Viking in the West.
[00:35:00.450 --> 00:35:02.451]  The Rus', the Red, the Red Hair.
[00:35:02.971 --> 00:35:08.353]  If you sit there and look at all of this, they would tell them, the high priest, we didn't have good crops.
[00:35:09.173 --> 00:35:17.496]  Because you, Hrothgar, did not give great enough offerings to Thor or to Odin!
[00:35:18.036 --> 00:35:20.957]  And now, you must be burned!
[00:35:22.378 --> 00:35:24.038]  They would say, yes, I agree, it's my fault.
[00:35:24.278 --> 00:35:25.539]  They could kill whoever they wanted.
[00:35:26.059 --> 00:35:26.779]  Every culture.
[00:35:27.399 --> 00:35:30.360]  Well, we didn't have good crops in our chalupas.
[00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:32.841]  Chalupa is a swamp-floating platform.
[00:35:33.301 --> 00:35:34.722]  That's where you get the term chalupa.
[00:35:35.302 --> 00:35:37.783]  We're gonna need double the children to be sacrificed.
[00:35:39.617 --> 00:35:39.877]  Woo!
[00:35:40.718 --> 00:35:43.279]  Works good every single time.
[00:35:43.639 --> 00:35:57.245]  And they even talk about this in the expanded subsections that we have screenshots of, of Road to Tyranny, of the 1996 Biological Diversity Assessment of the United Nations.
[00:35:59.106 --> 00:36:08.190]  They say, we need to bring back human sacrifice and war ritually, like the Aztecs had, to reduce population.
[00:36:11.212 --> 00:36:12.873]  And it's all a tool of control.
[00:36:12.953 --> 00:36:14.214]  It's the Hunger Games.
[00:36:15.535 --> 00:36:19.357]  I described to you a future like Hunger Games before those books even came out.
[00:36:22.079 --> 00:36:32.425]  Because all those books are describing is the type of world they want to make with big floating UN fortresses with international troops that can do whatever they want.
[00:36:33.541 --> 00:36:35.083]  I'm going to cover that at the start of the next hour.
[00:36:35.143 --> 00:36:36.425]  Raymond Teague, for some reason, is late.
[00:36:37.267 --> 00:36:38.849]  As soon as he gets here, we'll bring him in here.
[00:36:38.929 --> 00:36:43.496]  Our former Air Force intelligence slash NASA individual.
[00:36:43.516 --> 00:36:44.818]  Good friend of mine for about 15 years.
[00:36:45.139 --> 00:36:46.761]  Raymond's actually worked for me for a couple years.
[00:36:48.117 --> 00:36:49.659]  When he was in between jobs as an engineer.
[00:36:49.679 --> 00:36:51.442]  A really smart guy.
[00:36:51.462 --> 00:36:53.104]  71 years old.
[00:36:53.585 --> 00:36:54.266]  We like Raymond.
[00:36:54.607 --> 00:36:57.591]  He's certainly an interesting fella, so as soon as he pulls up, get him in here.
[00:36:57.611 --> 00:37:02.198]  Because if he pulls up and he gets stopped in the other part of the building, they'll all talk to him and it'll be the end of the show.
[00:37:05.754 --> 00:37:08.276]  Again, I want to play this clip if you just joined us one more time.
[00:37:08.536 --> 00:37:15.882]  Remember four years ago, the Copenhagen World Treaty, World Government Treaty, they were saying the UN is going to vote on it without anyone being allowed to read it.
[00:37:16.242 --> 00:37:30.614]  But in Denmark, the Danish text got leaked of it, just in Danish, but the full text, and then they had to release the English text, and it said right at double, right at 195 percent,
[00:37:33.433 --> 00:37:39.797]  More taxes on Africa, Latin America, Asia, Eastern Europe, all the poor areas of what the West.
[00:37:39.857 --> 00:37:40.557]  Now they sold it.
[00:37:40.757 --> 00:37:43.599]  Hey, we're going to get the rich, evil Western countries.
[00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:48.642]  And there were massive carbon taxes on the West, but right at double, not 200%.
[00:37:48.682 --> 00:37:54.606]  But, but, but, but, but right at double.
[00:37:56.282 --> 00:38:04.750]  195% of the taxes, and we're paying 100%, they'd be paying 195% of what we were paying, and Lord Monckton broke down the numbers.
[00:38:04.770 --> 00:38:08.072]  He's the guy that got the document, and got absolutely no credit for it.
[00:38:08.132 --> 00:38:15.238]  That's my point, you know, we broke that they're sharing all the NSA data with Europe, and they're spying on us, and we're spying on them, and the governments let each other do that.
[00:38:15.959 --> 00:38:18.521]  To create plausible deniability, and now that's big news today.
[00:38:18.981 --> 00:38:25.645]  Like, we break major news here every day, ladies and gentlemen, but the enemy media is not going to give us credit, so people realize the prestige.
[00:38:26.045 --> 00:38:27.906]  And I don't need the prestige for myself.
[00:38:28.426 --> 00:38:30.507]  You need to know the prestige of the Liberty Movement.
[00:38:30.968 --> 00:38:40.733]  You need to know that we're winning, and we're the real media, and... Maybe we should give our... have events and give each other awards and stuff, because I guess that means something.
[00:38:40.753 --> 00:38:44.996]  It's like Napoleon said, men will give their lives away for little pieces of metal and ribbon.
[00:38:46.045 --> 00:38:53.539]  And we're the opposite of that surface-oriented propaganda world, but at the same time, I don't think we all realize the effect we're having.
[00:38:55.763 --> 00:38:58.788]  That it came out, and we push it on this show,
[00:38:59.938 --> 00:39:03.040]  We got demonized in some of the press for actually helping push it out over the edge.
[00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:06.001]  Remember how I popped champagne on the air when that document came out?
[00:39:06.641 --> 00:39:10.723]  And then the documents came out of them meeting in secret at the UN about how to lie to the public?
[00:39:11.284 --> 00:39:13.765]  That was a Death Star blowing up level event.
[00:39:14.405 --> 00:39:16.446]  I mean, that really crippled the enemy.
[00:39:16.926 --> 00:39:18.187]  That was a devastating victory.
[00:39:19.708 --> 00:39:22.049]  I mean, I literally almost rolled around on the ground in pleasure.
[00:39:23.530 --> 00:39:27.812]  It'd be like the Rothschilds, you know, being, you know, caught in some huge crime and actually going to jail.
[00:39:28.432 --> 00:39:29.492]  It'd be like the Rockefellers.
[00:39:29.532 --> 00:39:41.917]  It'd be like the police locally doing the right thing and busting a CIA white slavery kidnapping aircraft on the tarmac and, you know, it all coming out on the news.
[00:39:41.977 --> 00:39:45.078]  I mean, it's Death Star level blowing up event.
[00:39:45.839 --> 00:39:46.099]  Okay?
[00:39:47.359 --> 00:39:50.302]  I mean, you want to run around for two weeks and have a celebration, that was it.
[00:39:50.942 --> 00:39:53.664]  Things like that are gigantor victories.
[00:39:54.085 --> 00:40:07.956]  It's a gigantor victory that we forced two billion bullets out in the open, and armored vehicles, and the fact that the government is predatory, arming against us in all their manuals, so people realize, wait, we have a predatory government, why is it setting up Homeland Security for us while running Al-Qaeda?
[00:40:08.196 --> 00:40:12.240]  The fact that that's all out in the news is a giant, devastating victory.
[00:40:13.527 --> 00:40:20.132]  The fact that Russian troops have already been deployed here for decades is a huge victory.
[00:40:20.652 --> 00:40:21.733]  That we're now exposing that.
[00:40:22.114 --> 00:40:29.859]  The fact that the things that they tried to suppress for decades have now been rammed out in the open is a devastating victory against tyranny.
[00:40:36.004 --> 00:40:38.306]  And so now, you go to Whole Foods, you go anywhere,
[00:40:39.738 --> 00:40:47.161]  Where people have the right idea to eat organic, to try to be healthy, but then they piggyback the tyranny on top every other magazine.
[00:40:47.441 --> 00:40:51.683]  Austerity, how great it is to be poor, how bad, you know, carbon is.
[00:40:51.783 --> 00:40:53.083]  Blah, blah, blah.
[00:40:53.404 --> 00:40:56.805]  Ignoring all the real crises and setting the globalist.
[00:40:56.845 --> 00:41:00.566]  Goldman Sachs is the number one funder of carbon taxes worldwide.
[00:41:00.847 --> 00:41:03.528]  The number one funder of all these fake green initiatives.
[00:41:03.548 --> 00:41:04.048]  Go look it up.
[00:41:04.548 --> 00:41:09.729]  Because they're the ones that run the carbon trading systems for all the major exchanges from the Chicago Mercantile.
[00:41:09.949 --> 00:41:17.651]  Look at who funds the Bilderberg Committee that's now being exposed in the British Parliament as being, it appears, illegal in the lobbying laws.
[00:41:18.971 --> 00:41:24.992]  The two funders, the only two donors to the Bilderberg Charity are Goldman Sachs and British Petroleum.
[00:41:28.173 --> 00:41:29.593]  Goldman Sachs, British Petroleum.
[00:41:29.933 --> 00:41:32.474]  The Queen of England is the majority owner of British Petroleum.
[00:41:32.634 --> 00:41:32.994]  Look it up.
[00:41:34.830 --> 00:41:37.613]  And in Goldman Sachs it's a Rockefeller Rothschild arm.
[00:41:38.854 --> 00:41:44.179]  Go look at who founded every UN organization, more than 50 of them, it's David Rockefeller.
[00:41:44.319 --> 00:41:45.961]  He's been given awards there where they brag about it.
[00:41:47.062 --> 00:41:48.663]  His family, who gave him the land.
[00:41:48.863 --> 00:41:57.592]  This is a corporate robber baron, global corporate government, get out of jail, free card system, where they
[00:41:59.454 --> 00:42:01.376]  Get to be above the law.
[00:42:02.037 --> 00:42:05.140]  UN personnel can be caught shipping drugs in.
[00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:06.020]  They're let go.
[00:42:06.441 --> 00:42:08.763]  They can be caught with slaves all the time in their apartment.
[00:42:08.963 --> 00:42:09.524]  Sex slaves.
[00:42:09.824 --> 00:42:10.465]  They get let go.
[00:42:11.586 --> 00:42:13.167]  Because they're above the law, folks.
[00:42:13.368 --> 00:42:14.108]  But it's not just them.
[00:42:14.168 --> 00:42:16.891]  It's this whole corporate anti-free market class.
[00:42:17.251 --> 00:42:20.454]  And now they come and say, Africa, you can't have nice cars.
[00:42:21.502 --> 00:42:32.464]  You can't have a nice house, you can't have air conditioning because we're going to burn the earth up when we have the lowest level of carbon dioxide ever recorded right now.
[00:42:32.624 --> 00:42:33.365]  It's very low.
[00:42:34.755 --> 00:43:00.649]  Let's go ahead and play a clip again, this is so bombshell, of Obama saying, unless we develop clean energies, which again, they don't let the real clean energies come out, they suppress those on record, and have windmill farms, Austin won't fund totally clean natural gas, has shut down all its power plants it owned, so GE plants make more money, we gotta buy money, pay money for Mexican power plants that are totally dirty, right over the border.
[00:43:01.801 --> 00:43:05.564]  All because Goldman Sachs and others came in and financed the city council people.
[00:43:06.584 --> 00:43:10.307]  And General Electric came in and so Austinites paid double what we paid five years ago.
[00:43:10.327 --> 00:43:12.168]  I heard them talking about it on the local radio this morning.
[00:43:12.428 --> 00:43:16.651]  Just incredible crimes being committed out in front of everybody.
[00:43:21.013 --> 00:43:21.714]  Do we have Raymond here?
[00:43:23.624 --> 00:43:23.864]  Okay.
[00:43:24.885 --> 00:43:27.567]  I just saw people walking around in the control room, so I thought maybe that was the case.
[00:43:27.927 --> 00:43:30.349]  Let's go ahead and play this clip right now.
[00:43:30.389 --> 00:43:30.869]  Here it is.
[00:43:30.929 --> 00:43:44.178]  The youth that everybody's mentioned here in Africa, if everybody's raising living standards to the point where everybody's got a car, and everybody's got air conditioning, and everybody's got a big house, well, the planet will boil over.
[00:43:44.978 --> 00:43:45.339]  Oh, yeah.
[00:43:45.439 --> 00:43:47.700]  Unless we find new ways of producing energy.
[00:43:48.461 --> 00:43:50.822]  Translation, if you
[00:43:52.961 --> 00:43:56.842]  The American people, the people of the world, don't pay megabanks $100 trillion.
[00:43:57.123 --> 00:44:03.305]  You guys put in Davos calls for $100 trillion in capital, and then it says it's a tax to private banks.
[00:44:03.325 --> 00:44:05.365]  $100 trillion in the next decade.
[00:44:05.586 --> 00:44:07.086]  And they're going ahead with it all.
[00:44:07.486 --> 00:44:11.788]  Obama signed on to carbon taxes last month, even though Congress shot it down three years ago.
[00:44:13.008 --> 00:44:13.989]  He just signed an order.
[00:44:15.509 --> 00:44:17.470]  And the companies will pay it and pass it on to you.
[00:44:19.537 --> 00:44:21.738]  I mean, this is such a big deal, folks.
[00:44:21.758 --> 00:44:22.598]  This is such a big deal.
[00:44:22.799 --> 00:44:34.004]  What about the right to not have foreign banks rip me off and shut down community-paid-for utilities that Austinites paid for over the last 70 years?
[00:44:35.404 --> 00:44:38.266]  They'd upgraded them, they'd built new plants on the sites, they shut them down.
[00:44:38.286 --> 00:44:38.606]  There it is.
[00:44:38.986 --> 00:44:39.646]  Over $100 trillion.
[00:44:41.331 --> 00:44:46.495]  Additional credit needed to support global growth from the World Economic Forum.
[00:44:46.755 --> 00:44:57.083]  And they call it credit, they mean taxes, because the way central banking works is for a dollar or a euro or a yen or a yon or a shilling to be created.
[00:44:58.863 --> 00:45:03.086]  A dollar of debts created that we owe to them, man.
[00:45:03.526 --> 00:45:05.507]  And they can't even take over the world like that.
[00:45:05.767 --> 00:45:08.209]  They've got to be able to selectively shut down all their competition.
[00:45:08.629 --> 00:45:17.294]  And you don't hear this on the money shows, on the yuppie shows, you won't hear this on Republican shows, because either they don't understand it or they're bought and paid for, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:45:17.514 --> 00:45:18.995]  I mean, this is so easy to understand.
[00:45:21.004 --> 00:45:23.946]  Let me get into the other news now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:45:23.986 --> 00:45:29.289]  And again, after Raymond leaves us sometime in the next hour, I will cover Russian forces to provide security at U.S.
[00:45:29.329 --> 00:45:29.669]  events.
[00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:30.990]  What's behind that?
[00:45:33.332 --> 00:45:44.879]  I'm gonna have the next issue of the magazine, the August issue, I'm gonna have that, I'm gonna write articles with all the facts, because no one seems to get the big picture that's hiding in 100% plain view, sitting on top of us.
[00:45:46.288 --> 00:45:49.909]  I mean, it's all public, the plan to occupy the U.S.
[00:45:50.089 --> 00:45:51.910]  with foreign troops and every other country.
[00:45:52.270 --> 00:45:53.110]  Don't you understand?
[00:45:53.130 --> 00:45:54.090]  They're just acclimating.
[00:45:56.691 --> 00:45:59.612]  I've had foreign troops walk up on tape and tell me, turn my camera off.
[00:45:59.992 --> 00:46:08.074]  In America, I made films 13, 14 years ago showing you troops training and saying they're training to take on Americans.
[00:46:11.976 --> 00:46:13.156]  Do you not understand that?
[00:46:15.549 --> 00:46:20.012]  In all the video games, in all the movies, in the R-O-C-T, R-O-C-T training.
[00:46:21.814 --> 00:46:24.736]  It's always fighting gun-owning, right-wing militias.
[00:46:25.076 --> 00:46:25.937]  And it's very racist.
[00:46:25.977 --> 00:46:30.100]  It's always fighting white people, in the manuals, that white males are the enemy.
[00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:31.741]  They don't want a new world order.
[00:46:32.402 --> 00:46:37.465]  Used to it was we believe in a new world order and a foreign global takeover by mega-banks and all the rest of this.
[00:46:37.506 --> 00:46:40.228]  Go read the ADL, Southern Poverty Law Center, demonizing yours truly.
[00:46:40.468 --> 00:46:43.150]  Now it's we're bad because we oppose it!
[00:46:43.792 --> 00:46:45.113]  We're the real Americans!
[00:46:45.193 --> 00:46:46.474]  Black, white, it doesn't matter.
[00:46:46.774 --> 00:46:52.937]  They want to frame it, though, like only hillbillies from Michigan or Texas in all these video games.
[00:46:53.438 --> 00:46:54.739]  Or Tennessee or Alabama.
[00:46:55.319 --> 00:46:58.681]  Oh, I don't want to be pro, you know, sovereignty and Bill of Rights.
[00:46:58.721 --> 00:47:00.842]  That's only white crackers that do that.
[00:47:00.882 --> 00:47:01.963]  I mean, that's, you know...
[00:47:02.463 --> 00:47:08.086]  The media always calls me and goes, so you're for national sovereignty and don't want open borders, don't want carbon taxes, and don't want your guns taken.
[00:47:08.306 --> 00:47:09.026]  Are you a racist?
[00:47:09.627 --> 00:47:12.568]  The Austin American Statesman asked me that one time and actually published it.
[00:47:12.868 --> 00:47:15.410]  I said, how do you respond to a question like that?
[00:47:15.710 --> 00:47:17.150]  What does this have to do with race?
[00:47:18.491 --> 00:47:19.612]  It was an issue of guns.
[00:47:20.712 --> 00:47:21.633]  It wasn't even borders.
[00:47:22.953 --> 00:47:24.034]  And this is what they do.
[00:47:25.723 --> 00:47:32.497]  I am an American patriot whose family goes back on both sides to the founding, not of the country.
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:35.741]  But to what became the colonies.
[00:47:36.001 --> 00:47:38.582]  My family has been here on both sides from the beginning.
[00:47:38.843 --> 00:47:44.945]  My family has done nothing in both sides of its lineage but defend liberty and defend freedom and defend this country.
[00:47:45.666 --> 00:47:47.327]  And help found the state of Texas.
[00:47:47.887 --> 00:47:49.287]  And I won't even get into all of that.
[00:47:49.768 --> 00:47:50.808]  I'm a real American.
[00:47:51.228 --> 00:47:52.069]  I'm a good guy.
[00:47:52.389 --> 00:47:54.010]  I recognize the enemy takeover.
[00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:57.131]  It's in my guts, it's in my genes, it's in my blood.
[00:47:57.311 --> 00:47:58.872]  That's why I didn't have to be told to do this.
[00:47:59.292 --> 00:48:03.034]  I instantly began resisting it from day one, as soon as I discovered it.
[00:48:03.354 --> 00:48:04.695]  And that's not because I'm a hero.
[00:48:04.855 --> 00:48:06.836]  It's because I simply want justice and liberty.
[00:48:07.116 --> 00:48:08.196]  I don't like being conquered.
[00:48:08.356 --> 00:48:09.557]  I don't like being usurped.
[00:48:09.737 --> 00:48:14.920]  I don't like seeing paramilitary police parading around, openly preparing for war with the American people.
[00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:17.221]  I'm not the enemy of these police either.
[00:48:17.401 --> 00:48:20.222]  They've been incrementally brainwashed, brought into this from birth.
[00:48:20.422 --> 00:48:22.663]  The cartoons are all about UN occupation.
[00:48:22.883 --> 00:48:26.105]  The cartoons, when I was a kid, were about gun owners being bad.
[00:48:27.793 --> 00:48:32.877]  We have been brought up in a giant lie and it's time to awaken from it now!
[00:48:32.897 --> 00:48:39.321]  NLE09, go pull it up on FEMA's own website.
[00:48:39.581 --> 00:48:43.904]  Troops from 15 countries trained to deal with the civil unrest in America.
[00:48:45.005 --> 00:48:50.889]  They will bring in foreign troops and by then it'll be so acclimated the uniforms have already been merged a decade ago.
[00:48:51.149 --> 00:48:57.174]  They've all joint trained, the local police have trained with Russians and Czechs and Polish and it doesn't matter.
[00:48:58.786 --> 00:49:08.293]  Because it's part of a global mega-banking plan that's playing the countries off against each other, so there's a mega-corporation above everything that then plays different regions off against each other.
[00:49:08.513 --> 00:49:22.024]  You've got all these police programs in every major city, where the police for 20 years are sent to Tokyo, and then, in the case of Austin, and then the Tokyo cops come here, and then they do agreements where they can arrest people there, blah, blah, blah.
[00:49:22.084 --> 00:49:23.765]  It's all global government.
[00:49:23.905 --> 00:49:24.566]  Look at Snowden.
[00:49:25.927 --> 00:49:26.487]  He went to 20
[00:49:28.041 --> 00:49:34.807]  Countries, 21 nations, asking for asylum and none of them but one communist state.
[00:49:35.731 --> 00:49:39.214]  And as much as I don't like Venezuelan socialists and communists, I've told you they're rogue.
[00:49:39.414 --> 00:49:40.595]  They're out there pretty much on their own.
[00:49:40.615 --> 00:49:41.996]  That's what the whole world wants to bring them down.
[00:49:42.457 --> 00:49:44.318]  I don't agree with their policies, but that's its own country.
[00:49:44.799 --> 00:49:48.562]  They're saying maybe, but they're all so scared because it's not just America they're dealing with.
[00:49:48.802 --> 00:49:55.908]  It's this global mafia where they want to be able to grab anybody they want anywhere, where you have no rights, you have no justice, you have no privacy, you have no freedom.
[00:49:56.128 --> 00:50:01.733]  And then the made men of the UN Rockefeller Rothschild-Sachs-Coburg-Gotha combine
[00:50:03.345 --> 00:50:10.050]  They are 110% above the law and can do anything they want.
[00:50:10.210 --> 00:50:24.139]  It even came out in the New York Times last year that the UN sent in troops in Central Africa but also in South America, and it lists the countries, to kill whole villages of people when land had been laid aside as a carbon sink off limits.
[00:50:24.179 --> 00:50:26.461]  They go and kill the villagers that live on it.
[00:50:29.621 --> 00:50:31.022]  They line them up and shoot them.
[00:50:31.502 --> 00:50:33.643]  But hey, Miss America always says the U.N.
[00:50:33.683 --> 00:50:42.167]  loves me, and you know, every good-looking girl you see at the shopping mall is wearing a UNICEF shirt, because that's what good-looking women do, because they saw Miss America do it.
[00:50:42.647 --> 00:50:46.769]  And Miss America and Miss USA, they say you need to have the NSA spying on you.
[00:50:47.269 --> 00:50:52.111]  You see, we're just roasting in this broth of fraud and poison.
[00:50:52.791 --> 00:50:56.315]  And now it's all, yes, the Russian troops will be at high security events in the U.S.
[00:50:56.355 --> 00:50:57.456]  now, running things.
[00:50:57.516 --> 00:50:58.357]  It's Russian troops.
[00:50:59.117 --> 00:51:00.198]  I got video from L.A.
[00:51:00.238 --> 00:51:00.579]  coming up.
[00:51:03.274 --> 00:51:09.738]  Big business has discovered the preparedness market, and that makes it difficult to know where to go and who to trust.

[00:52:02.406 --> 00:52:12.729]  With health threats on the rise such as West Nile virus, MRSA, and now the new bird flu recently discovered in China, there has never been a more crucial time to support your immune system.

[00:53:01.021 --> 00:53:10.268]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:53:10.329 --> 00:53:11.069]  This capitalism?
[00:53:11.129 --> 00:53:17.234]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:53:17.294 --> 00:53:20.937]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[00:53:30.885 --> 00:53:34.367]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:53:34.527 --> 00:53:38.489]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:53:38.809 --> 00:53:40.270]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:53:40.590 --> 00:53:48.194]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[00:53:48.454 --> 00:53:49.295]  But for how long?
[00:53:49.595 --> 00:53:55.858]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:53:56.238 --> 00:53:59.040]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:54:29.361 --> 00:54:31.983]  By the way, I said earlier we were waiting on Raymond Teague.
[00:54:32.003 --> 00:54:34.145]  It was a typo in my guest list write-up.
[00:54:34.185 --> 00:54:34.485]  It says 11.30.
[00:54:34.525 --> 00:54:37.368]  He'll be with us at the start of the next hour.
[00:54:38.309 --> 00:54:47.677]  And then at the bottom of the next hour, I will break down the plan to bring in multinational forces and put our own military under the UN, which has already happened.
[00:54:47.697 --> 00:54:53.522]  Remember last year, and again this year, when they told Congress that our military was under NATO and UN command?
[00:54:54.741 --> 00:54:55.841]  And nothing happened, did it?
[00:54:56.461 --> 00:54:57.922]  And now our government runs Al-Qaeda.
[00:54:58.542 --> 00:54:59.022]  Publicly.
[00:54:59.142 --> 00:54:59.802]  And nothing happened.
[00:54:59.822 --> 00:55:00.962]  And they're like, well of course we run it.
[00:55:01.423 --> 00:55:02.243]  They're the good guys.
[00:55:02.643 --> 00:55:03.863]  The gun owners are the bad guys.
[00:55:04.283 --> 00:55:05.384]  And I'm not being sarcastic.
[00:55:05.604 --> 00:55:06.464]  That's in the news.
[00:55:07.444 --> 00:55:11.285]  And then Professor Griff of Public Enemy is going to be in studio with us coming up.
[00:55:12.125 --> 00:55:14.166]  Now if you're a TV viewer, you can see this.
[00:55:14.206 --> 00:55:18.227]  If you're a radio listener, you can go to Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:55:18.727 --> 00:55:21.027]  Infowars.com forward slash show and see this.
[00:55:21.047 --> 00:55:23.508]  And I'm going to cover this some after Raymond leaves us as well.
[00:55:25.291 --> 00:55:32.214]  Now, you see this Time Magazine, Rise of the Robots, We've Got Company, How Smart Machines Will Change Our Lives.
[00:55:33.034 --> 00:55:40.217]  I was in a bookstore this weekend with my son, and he said, Dad, look, it's the headline from your magazine.
[00:55:41.317 --> 00:55:42.638]  Now, this is copyright 2013.
[00:55:42.678 --> 00:55:47.420]  As you can see, if you're a TV viewer, copyright 2013.
[00:55:47.460 --> 00:55:48.180]  Right there.
[00:55:54.485 --> 00:55:58.228]  And I'm going to review some of this because it's very informative how robots are going to run our life.
[00:55:58.268 --> 00:55:59.269]  It actually says that in here.
[00:55:59.549 --> 00:56:00.310]  Now let's go back to it.
[00:56:00.690 --> 00:56:02.892]  Time Magazine, the cover, Rise of the Robots.
[00:56:03.653 --> 00:56:06.415]  We've got company, how smart machines will change our lives.
[00:56:07.056 --> 00:56:12.641]  It's got the loving drone and the loving robots in school watching you and the loving undersea robots.
[00:56:13.702 --> 00:56:18.286]  Now, here is the October issue last year.
[00:56:19.910 --> 00:56:25.395]  Of InfoWars Magazine, The End of Humanity, Rise of the Robots.
[00:56:28.578 --> 00:56:37.207]  And now you read Time Magazine, and it's Rise of the Robots, how loving the little robots are, like the loving Predator drone right there.
[00:56:38.408 --> 00:56:40.149]  So I'm going to be, again, breaking this down.
[00:56:40.209 --> 00:56:44.794]  Speaking of InfoWars Magazine, it shows how we're affecting change out there, folks.
[00:56:46.072 --> 00:56:49.135]  Next, we have a cautionary tale at the end about the robots.
[00:56:49.235 --> 00:56:56.824]  It's kind of like, hey, you won't be able to get a job with the college degree you're getting for $180,000, but we're going to warn you in the emails about the college loan.
[00:56:56.844 --> 00:56:58.265]  It's kind of like, hey, the vampire.
[00:56:58.485 --> 00:57:00.227]  Hey, if you let a vampire in, they'll rip your head off.
[00:57:00.247 --> 00:57:01.729]  But I'm not a vampire, so let me in.
[00:57:01.949 --> 00:57:02.490]  Oh, come on in.
[00:57:03.130 --> 00:57:04.090]  Actually, I was a vampire.
[00:57:04.531 --> 00:57:07.412]  So, you know, they like to warn you by the end of the magazine.
[00:57:07.452 --> 00:57:09.673]  It's like, oh, by the way, you won't be needed anymore.
[00:57:09.693 --> 00:57:10.553]  You're going to be dealt with.
[00:57:11.473 --> 00:57:15.695]  Robot Alchemy by Tex Marge is available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:57:15.715 --> 00:57:18.276]  It's his latest coffee table book.
[00:57:18.696 --> 00:57:20.637]  These are the easiest to read, best books.
[00:57:20.777 --> 00:57:25.258]  Hardcore data, but full of photos, full of posters, full of history.
[00:57:25.619 --> 00:57:28.380]  Let me flip through this for some of the TV viewers out there.
[00:57:28.780 --> 00:57:30.860]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:57:32.361 --> 00:57:42.345]  And you can read the entire history of robotics by the space and aeronautics professor, who is really a leading expert and has sold some of the best-selling books ever on robots.
[00:57:42.765 --> 00:57:45.587]  And your purchase also supports our broadcast show.
[00:57:45.987 --> 00:57:57.692]  Robot Alchemy, The Religion of the New World Order, The Age of Spiritual Machines is basically what it's breaking down, Android Cyborgs and the Magic of Artificial Life, available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:58:00.819 --> 00:58:11.731]  And then lastly, ladies and gentlemen, the July issue, we got a whole bunch extra this year because I figured this would be a popular issue with the 10 free bumper stickers when you get the magazine.
[00:58:12.351 --> 00:58:18.678]  And with it being the NSA topic, breaking down what the NSA is really doing, it is selling faster than any other magazine we've ever had.
[00:58:19.887 --> 00:58:25.470]  So get it in bulk, groups of 10 up to 100 at cost with 10 bumper stickers inside.
[00:58:25.810 --> 00:58:31.513]  Over 500,000 bumper stickers total with powerful messages like America has been occupied by globalist forces.
[00:58:31.853 --> 00:58:32.853]  Infowars.com.
[00:58:32.893 --> 00:58:33.654]  Listen to Alex Jones.
[00:58:33.934 --> 00:58:34.874]  Infowars.com.
[00:58:35.134 --> 00:58:35.815]  Things like that.
[00:58:36.575 --> 00:58:38.036]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:58:38.136 --> 00:58:38.416]  Get it.
[00:58:38.716 --> 00:58:39.657]  Get it out to everybody you know.
[00:58:39.677 --> 00:58:48.361]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:51.730 --> 00:58:53.371]  Introducing Pro-1.
[00:58:53.611 --> 00:58:57.133]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[00:58:57.273 --> 00:59:01.675]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[00:59:01.795 --> 00:59:07.798]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:59:07.918 --> 00:59:18.703]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.
[00:59:18.903 --> 00:59:21.586]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gates!
[00:59:21.766 --> 00:59:25.210]  We have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[00:59:25.410 --> 00:59:40.125]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands,
[00:59:40.345 --> 00:59:41.906]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:06.448 --> 01:00:10.652]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:11.292 --> 01:00:12.093]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.873 --> 01:00:13.834]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:14.415 --> 01:00:18.018]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.598 --> 01:00:22.722]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:30.108 --> 01:00:30.848]  Alright, folks.
[01:00:31.449 --> 01:00:32.570]  It is Tuesday.
[01:00:34.355 --> 01:00:35.956]  The second day of July 2013.
[01:00:38.257 --> 01:00:41.319]  My old friend, Raymond Teague, is going to be in studio with us for 30 minutes.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:47.583]  Then at the bottom of the next hour, I will get to all the big news I haven't covered yet.
[01:00:47.924 --> 01:00:51.806]  Trayvon supporters threaten riots, looting if Zimmerman acquitted.
[01:00:52.186 --> 01:00:54.668]  That story is going viral up on InfoWars.com.
[01:00:55.930 --> 01:00:56.450]  Here's another one.
[01:00:56.631 --> 01:00:58.152]  All he did was love me.
[01:00:58.532 --> 01:00:59.713]  Heartbreaking moment.
[01:00:59.753 --> 01:01:05.979]  Police shoot and kill dog that was defending owner when officers arrested him for filming them.
[01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:08.281]  Here's another one.
[01:01:08.721 --> 01:01:12.504]  The TSA is now going to add dogs, but not so much for bombs, for drugs.
[01:01:12.845 --> 01:01:15.887]  This is all just getting you ready for internal prison training.
[01:01:16.808 --> 01:01:19.470]  Is Homeland Security set to arm TSA agents?
[01:01:20.271 --> 01:01:21.652]  And they're already arming some.
[01:01:21.692 --> 01:01:23.454]  Paul answers the question in the article.
[01:01:24.861 --> 01:01:28.085]  And they're training the TSA right next to the military.
[01:01:28.706 --> 01:01:33.832]  Again, first you roll out with an innocuous National Security Force Obama promised, and then they become armed.
[01:01:34.492 --> 01:01:35.594]  Like the armed SS.
[01:01:36.295 --> 01:01:38.417]  The Stunstaffel, I believe it was called.
[01:01:38.898 --> 01:01:40.720]  So we'll be going over some of that.
[01:01:42.001 --> 01:01:44.522]  That is just some of what we'll be breaking down today.
[01:01:44.663 --> 01:01:50.285]  And Raymond Teague, my buddy, came by last week and he didn't say, hey, this is really off record.
[01:01:50.566 --> 01:01:52.186]  He said, you know, this stuff isn't really classified.
[01:01:52.206 --> 01:01:55.388]  And so I talked about some of it later.
[01:01:55.408 --> 01:01:56.889]  He's like, I'm not really comfortable about that.
[01:01:57.769 --> 01:02:10.372]  So when we come back, we'll get into NASA, but we'll also get into the whole NSA thing from the Snowden perspective, because Raymond worked in different classified federal agencies, starting out with Air Force Intelligence, NASA, Mission Control.
[01:02:10.392 --> 01:02:11.292]  We'll show you photos.
[01:02:11.552 --> 01:02:12.833]  We dug up photos online of you, Raymond.
[01:02:12.853 --> 01:02:13.413]  You didn't know that.
[01:02:13.733 --> 01:02:14.873]  So Raymond Teague's here.
[01:02:14.893 --> 01:02:18.234]  We're going to be talking to him after the break in studio.
[01:02:18.934 --> 01:02:26.316]  And as I said, we'll get to all these other big top stories that I just mentioned that are up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:02:26.676 --> 01:02:42.149]  But I got so upset last hour, watching our power plants, our industries, our jobs, shut down on record, and here's Obama saying, you shouldn't be able to have a nice standard of living, when these globalists are just transferring it to them, they want to make us poor to control us, and wrote white paper saying it!
[01:02:43.010 --> 01:02:49.876]  And they get people to get in to being poor, in to having nothing, in to having no rights, and forget just monetary wealth.
[01:02:50.839 --> 01:02:51.479]  No dignity.
[01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:52.520]  No Fourth Amendment.
[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:53.361]  No First Amendment.
[01:02:53.401 --> 01:02:54.121]  No Second Amendment.
[01:02:54.181 --> 01:02:54.861]  No Tenth Amendment.
[01:02:55.102 --> 01:02:55.802]  No Ninth Amendment.
[01:02:55.962 --> 01:02:58.824]  And all over the world, the same continuity of agenda.
[01:03:01.185 --> 01:03:04.247]  And the globalists dividing and conquering us on every front.
[01:03:04.327 --> 01:03:06.148]  And then I'll also get into it with Raymond.
[01:03:08.149 --> 01:03:09.170]  State Department memorandum 7277.
[01:03:09.370 --> 01:03:11.652]  In fact, we can foreshadow some of this.
[01:03:12.132 --> 01:03:14.793]  Russian forces to provide security at U.S.
[01:03:14.873 --> 01:03:15.214]  events.
[01:03:16.074 --> 01:03:16.915]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:03:18.024 --> 01:03:36.404]  We sent Rob Dew and Jason Douglas, two of our reporters, through an affiliate and got press passes four years ago, I guess three years ago, we have video of this, with Polish troops training to confiscate Americans' guns and to put us in sports stadiums.
[01:03:38.666 --> 01:03:41.509]  I mean, you know, it's just over the top.
[01:03:41.749 --> 01:03:45.152]  People watch the video and it admits it, but they're still like, well, it isn't that bad.
[01:03:45.972 --> 01:03:48.334]  It's just this complete acclimation.
[01:03:48.354 --> 01:03:51.857]  So we're going to be going over all of that with Raymond Tego.
[01:03:51.877 --> 01:03:55.460]  I appreciate coming in to studio with us today.
[01:03:55.740 --> 01:03:57.541]  And Raymond, we're about to go to break.
[01:03:57.561 --> 01:04:01.645]  So let me just ask you this, because you just got here right on time before you're supposed to go on air.
[01:04:02.846 --> 01:04:05.488]  You said you are comfortable talking about the mission control stuff, right?
[01:04:08.103 --> 01:04:08.403]  You are?
[01:04:08.443 --> 01:04:08.784]  You are?
[01:04:08.884 --> 01:04:09.104]  Yes.
[01:04:09.384 --> 01:04:10.465]  Okay, so we can talk about that.
[01:04:10.766 --> 01:04:10.966]  Yes.
[01:04:11.086 --> 01:04:13.228]  Because people always want to know if the moon landings happened.
[01:04:13.889 --> 01:04:18.293]  And you're bigger than Dallas for right there and a main guy on Mission Control, so you can talk about it.
[01:04:18.333 --> 01:04:20.235]  Well, I'm far from being a main guy.
[01:04:20.416 --> 01:04:26.081]  I was one of the workers and I did the best I could with my duties.
[01:04:26.141 --> 01:04:28.584]  But you were a main Mission Control guy, frontline running it.
[01:04:28.724 --> 01:04:28.984]  Yes.
[01:04:29.565 --> 01:04:30.266]  You're in the front row.
[01:04:31.769 --> 01:04:34.952]  Well, that doesn't mean anything, another chair, as far as the position.
[01:04:35.352 --> 01:04:44.819]  What is important is, the duties you had, for every guy you saw in Mission Control, there was a whole room full of people supporting you.
[01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:46.861]  That you were in contact with.
[01:04:47.041 --> 01:04:51.645]  But I mean, you got a Presidential Medal, and you were the A-Team guy.
[01:04:51.665 --> 01:04:53.787]  You were the guy who had a whole room supporting you.
[01:04:53.807 --> 01:04:55.268]  You were in front line Mission Control, Raymond.
[01:04:56.649 --> 01:04:57.430]  Just toot your horn.
[01:04:57.570 --> 01:05:00.232]  Yeah, well... Stay there, we'll be right back with Raymond Teague.
[01:05:01.767 --> 01:05:05.390]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us?
[01:05:05.630 --> 01:05:10.915]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[01:05:11.155 --> 01:05:18.721]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[01:05:18.881 --> 01:05:27.989]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[01:05:28.189 --> 01:05:35.195]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[01:05:35.356 --> 01:05:38.218]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[01:05:38.238 --> 01:05:45.144]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse but demand a war.
[01:05:45.865 --> 01:05:47.968]  Out of another one, another plane just hit!

[01:08:29.582 --> 01:08:32.048]  Russian forces to provide security at U.S.
[01:08:32.149 --> 01:08:32.489]  events.
[01:08:32.529 --> 01:08:33.472]  You can't make that up.
[01:08:33.492 --> 01:08:36.238]  That's a FEMA press release with photos.
[01:08:36.258 --> 01:08:37.321]  They're very proud of themselves.
[01:08:38.646 --> 01:08:41.608]  What's wrong with Russian troops with guns at security events?
[01:08:42.649 --> 01:08:44.730]  You're a traitor if you don't salute the New World Order.
[01:08:44.750 --> 01:08:47.692]  I'm going to break down at the bottom of the hour what this is really all about.
[01:08:48.693 --> 01:08:52.936]  Because believe me, I've done more studying on this than anybody outside the globalist operation.
[01:08:53.597 --> 01:08:55.038]  Okay, I've interviewed all the experts.
[01:08:55.238 --> 01:08:56.419]  I know the total plan.
[01:08:56.699 --> 01:08:58.921]  Because by the way, I took the time out to read it.
[01:08:59.121 --> 01:08:59.861]  It's all public.
[01:09:00.562 --> 01:09:04.485]  We're going to break down 7277 State Department memorandum for you today.
[01:09:05.746 --> 01:09:08.331]  State Department randoms, folks, are the real policy of this government.
[01:09:08.792 --> 01:09:10.695]  The policy is sell us out to the New World Order.
[01:09:11.436 --> 01:09:14.221]  Is Homeland Security set to arm TSA agents?
[01:09:14.241 --> 01:09:15.523]  That's at Infowars.com.
[01:09:17.085 --> 01:09:17.265]  I don't
[01:09:38.983 --> 01:09:42.364]  You name it, Trayvon supporters threaten riots, looting of Zimmerman acquitted.
[01:09:42.384 --> 01:09:46.125]  This is the exact type of divide and conquer the White House has tried to hype.
[01:09:46.145 --> 01:09:51.647]  The Justice Department's been caught in there trying to hype this up as a political diversion of racial division.
[01:09:51.667 --> 01:09:55.368]  So we're going to be breaking all of that down as well at the bottom of the hour.
[01:09:55.768 --> 01:09:58.849]  But joining us till the bottom of the hour is my old friend Raymond Teague.
[01:09:59.369 --> 01:10:02.550]  He even worked for me off and on for a few years in TV production.
[01:10:03.310 --> 01:10:06.951]  He worked for RCA with the space shuttle cameras.
[01:10:07.811 --> 01:10:18.576]  And before that he was in Vietnam in Classified Operations and he was in Air Force Intelligence in Classified Operations and was in Air Force Intelligence for a while before he went into some other agencies he can't talk about.
[01:10:19.056 --> 01:10:21.137]  And then he worked in, of course, NASA.
[01:10:21.717 --> 01:10:28.360]  Before that in the Apollo program, and we've got some photos of him in Mission Control as one of the A-Line guys.
[01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:33.322]  There's Raymond Teague right there on the Apollo programs.
[01:10:33.722 --> 01:10:35.423]  Weren't you involved in Apollo 13 too, buddy?
[01:10:36.103 --> 01:10:36.724]  Yes, I was.
[01:10:38.004 --> 01:10:56.400]  Apollo 13 occurred at the end of my shift for that particular day, and I was in the last hour of my shift for a changeover, and I stayed through the next shift along with everybody else, but I was requested, my boss told me to call everybody in, so I called all three of our, the other two shifts in.
[01:10:57.842 --> 01:11:00.083]  And that was rather strange.
[01:11:00.123 --> 01:11:02.304]  They all demanded, what do you want me to come in for?
[01:11:02.384 --> 01:11:06.386]  Well, I'm not allowed to tell you, but just get ready and get in here as quick as you can.
[01:11:06.406 --> 01:11:07.766]  That's what they were told.
[01:11:07.786 --> 01:11:08.267]  And they did.
[01:11:09.627 --> 01:11:13.169]  And so we had everybody on board to help study the problems.
[01:11:13.829 --> 01:11:17.610]  We're going to look at the moon landings and really get a real inside take here.
[01:11:17.630 --> 01:11:19.051]  In fact, this may go longer than 30 minutes.
[01:11:19.111 --> 01:11:20.352]  I said I've got to get to this other news.
[01:11:21.334 --> 01:11:23.615]  Raymond, first off, you want to talk about Snowden.
[01:11:25.935 --> 01:11:32.337]  Give people your breakdown, where you've worked, what you've done that you can talk about so people understand that you speak from experience.
[01:11:34.338 --> 01:11:42.080]  Well, as far as Snowden goes, I think Snowden, there must be more to it than we see because
[01:11:43.709 --> 01:11:54.938]  I haven't, I don't know what Snowden has revealed other than it was fairly well known as far as what Snowden said that we were looking at all the data, they were, the NSA was looking at the world's data.
[01:11:55.539 --> 01:11:57.941]  Well, that's what all intelligence agencies do.
[01:11:58.261 --> 01:12:02.104]  Every country that's a modern country has an intelligence agency.
[01:12:02.124 --> 01:12:03.986]  Snowden said that bears go poop in the woods?
[01:12:05.907 --> 01:12:08.630]  And you can expect everything to be looked at.
[01:12:09.010 --> 01:12:10.411]  So, so what?
[01:12:11.072 --> 01:12:12.032]  So what's the big deal?
[01:12:13.126 --> 01:12:13.587]  I don't know.
[01:12:13.607 --> 01:12:15.690]  I am surprised.
[01:12:15.790 --> 01:12:22.339]  If they really wanted Snowden out of the picture, they would have immediately killed him like they have others.
[01:12:23.761 --> 01:12:29.468]  So even if he's hiding in the Moscow airport, that doesn't mean he's assassination proof.
[01:12:30.643 --> 01:12:36.908]  Anybody can come by and shoot him or whatever or give him an injection and he'd be gone.
[01:12:36.928 --> 01:12:40.211]  That's right, they've got those poison ice darts.
[01:12:40.731 --> 01:12:45.475]  There's many different ways to... They shoot you with a little ice dart, it's got cyanide in it and boom, you're gone.
[01:12:46.616 --> 01:12:48.858]  Well, ricin's become a favorite also.
[01:12:50.339 --> 01:12:54.543]  Anyway, I don't see what the big deal is about Snowden other than
[01:12:57.044 --> 01:12:57.945]  Something is going on.
[01:12:57.985 --> 01:12:58.725]  They're covering up.
[01:12:59.326 --> 01:13:06.571]  Well, I think he's real, but they're using him because he is somebody that ran to a foreign country to just scare all the other whistleblowers.
[01:13:07.511 --> 01:13:08.972]  The biggest thing it does is this.
[01:13:09.753 --> 01:13:12.835]  The way the communist system worked in East Germany and the communist...
[01:13:16.579 --> 01:13:34.929]  If you half of the people were involved with the security services and so if you said anything to the wrong person or had a thought committed a fraud crime that somebody overheard you got thrown in the gulag or killed.
[01:13:35.976 --> 01:13:38.178]  And so that made you afraid to talk to anybody else.
[01:13:38.198 --> 01:13:48.668]  You wouldn't cooperate with anybody else to establish a new political realm or... That's how they destroyed the individual was by naming political dissent as terrorism as they're now doing here.
[01:13:49.181 --> 01:13:51.303]  And I think this is the deal with Snowden.
[01:13:51.943 --> 01:14:03.253]  Now you're more aware that if you say anything on the phone, or you try to coordinate with anybody on the email, you might as well run it in the New York Times.
[01:14:03.273 --> 01:14:07.737]  Well, that's what Pchenik called when this all broke, and he said, Alex, it's a psy-op.
[01:14:08.297 --> 01:14:10.419]  I know General Alexander.
[01:14:10.979 --> 01:14:11.920]  Maybe we should get him on.
[01:14:12.781 --> 01:14:16.484]  But he goes, this is being done to bring all this out to create a conversation about it.
[01:14:18.069 --> 01:14:18.849]  Well, it's done that.
[01:14:19.870 --> 01:14:21.851]  But I don't think Snowden knows what he's doing.
[01:14:23.212 --> 01:14:32.776]  And then it forces us to defend him because of the free speech issues and they're trying to persecute the press, but then it changes the subject from a week before he came out it was all NSA spying on the press.
[01:14:34.337 --> 01:14:35.898]  See, it's an issue of who they're spying on.
[01:14:37.352 --> 01:14:42.033]  Yes, well, you can assume anything you say or do will be monitored.
[01:14:42.574 --> 01:14:57.018]  Now listen, I thought I could talk about what you told us in here last week, and I want to get into the NASA stuff, but since I've already said it out there, specifically, many people know I don't make stuff up, what were you told when you graduated from an intelligence agency?
[01:14:59.078 --> 01:15:04.800]  Oh, they tell you going in, that if you get too far out of line, they may kill you.
[01:15:07.146 --> 01:15:08.687]  And that was, if you talk, we're going to kill you?
[01:15:09.428 --> 01:15:09.908]  Essentially.
[01:15:11.229 --> 01:15:12.210]  What specifically?
[01:15:12.490 --> 01:15:13.831]  I don't remember the exact words.
[01:15:14.291 --> 01:15:31.483]  And you said too, though, at graduation, though, you were sitting around, you know, like at the final... Well, you had a debriefing where you're not allowed to go to travel outside of the country without permission for a certain length of time and essentially not allowed to work for various people.
[01:15:32.824 --> 01:15:33.865]  For several years.
[01:15:34.405 --> 01:15:39.410]  Now, they reported the shuttle program you worked on was at least 80% secret military operations.
[01:15:39.690 --> 01:15:40.551]  Did you work on those?
[01:15:44.515 --> 01:15:46.637]  Yes, but you're talking about payloads.
[01:15:46.717 --> 01:15:50.580]  Now, I didn't really have much to do with the actual payloads.
[01:15:51.921 --> 01:15:56.386]  The shuttle was flying, in order to launch satellites, the shuttle would carry a, say,
[01:15:59.619 --> 01:16:03.381]  Communication Satellite up, but it would have its own rocket.
[01:16:04.142 --> 01:16:18.270]  In other words, when you got it up into orbit, you then set it outside the payload bay, and after getting a safe distance away from it, you would light the engine and put it into whatever orbit it was intended to be in.
[01:16:19.570 --> 01:16:21.091]  And that was done many times over.
[01:16:22.572 --> 01:16:26.874]  But there wasn't anything especially secret about it, except the payloads.
[01:16:28.476 --> 01:16:31.818]  Well, I apologize if I said too much, but you said none of this is really classified.
[01:16:31.838 --> 01:16:42.146]  You talked about, you know, the 97 hearings on the CIA, Solicitor General, and drug dealing, and you just said that it was well known in the intelligence community, watching the communiques, that it was just all over the place, correct?
[01:16:42.646 --> 01:16:43.026]  Correct.
[01:16:44.588 --> 01:16:47.450]  And, uh, there are other things.
[01:16:48.110 --> 01:16:51.252]  For instance, here's a book here that I read lately.
[01:16:51.272 --> 01:16:55.896]  The Elite Serial Killers of Lincoln, JFK, RFK, and MLK.
[01:16:55.936 --> 01:16:56.596]  Robert Galen Ross.
[01:16:56.616 --> 01:16:57.357]  Yeah, we sell that book.
[01:16:58.638 --> 01:17:05.614]  Okay, well the most amazing thing about it is, especially on the description of the JFK, I worked with an engineer...
[01:17:07.168 --> 01:17:29.801]  uh... sometime ago lived in Dallas, grew up in Dallas, knew a bunch of people on the Dallas police force and we got into discussions over the JFK assassination up to the point where he was really afraid of me and afraid to say anything else and this was many years after the assassination and he was still afraid to talk about it.
[01:17:29.961 --> 01:17:33.063]  I was on an airplane with a well-known lawyer, I'll just leave it at that, buddies with the Bushes
[01:17:33.903 --> 01:17:39.169]  And he was just, this is flying back from Dallas when I flew in from London, and he was just, like, going to course.
[01:17:39.249 --> 01:17:43.213]  I grew up with my ranch next door to the lawyer that was running the whole thing.
[01:17:43.233 --> 01:17:45.235]  I mean, it's just in Dallas, it's well known.
[01:17:45.275 --> 01:17:47.498]  I mean, only an idiot knows they didn't kill Kennedy.
[01:17:50.293 --> 01:18:09.020]  And the book explains the frightening thing about our whole country, our whole system is we have sunk in morality to the point where you can have most of the government officials of a city and of a state and of a nation in on an assassination and that's viewed as alright.
[01:18:09.300 --> 01:18:12.081]  That's a normal course of doing business.
[01:18:12.101 --> 01:18:14.982]  What do you think about Hastings, Michael Hastings of the Rolling Stone?
[01:18:16.564 --> 01:18:19.985]  Well, I didn't know his work, or him, or anything about him.
[01:18:20.685 --> 01:18:25.726]  And yes, I believe just like this one that got killed in Houston, that was assassinated.
[01:18:27.367 --> 01:18:30.147]  I didn't know him either, but yeah, that's an example.
[01:18:31.908 --> 01:18:40.830]  But nowadays they just blow your car up, and then the wife's come out through his friends and tweets and things, and I've talked to his army buddy, and they believe he was killed.
[01:18:40.850 --> 01:18:41.710]  They want an investigation.
[01:18:42.011 --> 01:18:43.491]  You'd think that would be news.
[01:18:44.468 --> 01:18:55.475]  Well, when you have something like Pat Tillman go on, and many other examples somewhat similar to that, how can we do anything as a nation anymore?
[01:18:56.356 --> 01:18:57.516]  There's nobody to turn to.
[01:18:57.756 --> 01:19:07.663]  There's nobody that has an overall power to set things right, to make a moral judgment, to provide moral leadership.
[01:19:07.743 --> 01:19:10.985]  Apparently... And then once you reach that point, though, it only gets worse in history.
[01:19:11.745 --> 01:19:16.790]  Because once it's the rule of the thug, once it's the rule of assassination death squads, it's over.
[01:19:16.830 --> 01:19:17.810]  They'll take everything.
[01:19:18.251 --> 01:19:23.856]  And even if the Dons that are in place now won't do it, they will be replaced by people that want to do it.
[01:19:24.216 --> 01:19:26.418]  The worse for the worse, then, take over.
[01:19:27.657 --> 01:19:30.679]  Well, there's no end of the greed.
[01:19:30.739 --> 01:19:36.443]  In other words, in football and everything else, nothing is ever good enough.
[01:19:37.063 --> 01:19:38.424]  It's part of our big problems.
[01:19:39.165 --> 01:19:43.688]  We don't have enough money, we don't have enough of a house, we don't have enough of anything.
[01:19:44.108 --> 01:19:46.449]  This is the general attitude in the public.
[01:19:47.430 --> 01:19:51.073]  And so they're willing to sell themselves to always get more.
[01:19:51.453 --> 01:19:54.455]  And in truth, they're going to lose everything because they sold out.
[01:19:55.421 --> 01:19:55.821]  That's right.
[01:19:55.841 --> 01:19:56.702]  We'll be right back, Raymond.

[01:24:01.762 --> 01:24:03.903]  Is it getting better?
[01:24:18.104 --> 01:24:25.847]  All right, Raymond Teague is our guest.
[01:24:25.867 --> 01:24:27.268]  We'll be with us until about 40 after.
[01:24:27.288 --> 01:24:31.309]  Then I will get into Russian forces provide security at U.S.
[01:24:31.369 --> 01:24:34.691]  events, what this really means, how this is going to be phased in.
[01:24:34.711 --> 01:24:43.014]  This is an important talk on air because then my writers, Paul Watson, Kurt Nemo, and others who have an understanding of this as well can go off my talking points.
[01:24:43.454 --> 01:24:45.375]  They can go look up everything I'm going to say
[01:24:46.075 --> 01:24:50.981]  They just search whatever I say, and then articles and documents come up, and then they'll write stories on it.
[01:24:51.261 --> 01:24:54.245]  Because no one has given everybody the full picture.
[01:24:54.986 --> 01:24:55.847]  Except myself.
[01:24:56.507 --> 01:24:57.689]  And that is not a good feeling.
[01:24:58.950 --> 01:25:00.312]  That is not a good feeling.
[01:25:01.889 --> 01:25:05.134]  The people that came the closest to it 50 years ago were John Birch Society.
[01:25:05.394 --> 01:25:08.759]  And that's because they had military insiders that were patriots and leaked.
[01:25:08.799 --> 01:25:11.022]  They were being told we're going to be occupied by UN troops.
[01:25:11.403 --> 01:25:12.885]  People are like, oh yeah, crazy man.
[01:25:12.905 --> 01:25:14.627]  We're going to explain how this works.
[01:25:14.667 --> 01:25:16.069]  It's not just us that's going to get occupied.
[01:25:16.089 --> 01:25:16.870]  It's going to be everybody.
[01:25:17.171 --> 01:25:17.411]  Raymond.
[01:25:18.734 --> 01:25:27.318]  I want to get into the fact of did we go to the moon, because there you are on the major Apollo missions, you're being told it's all happening, but you told me off air, you said look.
[01:25:27.498 --> 01:25:31.800]  Well, I mean, repeat what you said and then tell me about the Russian engineer you worked with and what they said.
[01:25:32.681 --> 01:25:37.483]  Okay, one more thing I'm going to put on for Snowden that nobody has looked at.
[01:25:37.503 --> 01:25:40.905]  That's why Snowden is not such a big deal.
[01:25:42.239 --> 01:25:55.418]  And all of these companies I've worked for, which is several, three solid state companies here, device manufacturers, they have in their employee Chinese and Indian and other
[01:25:57.145 --> 01:26:01.049]  People that are from China from Formosa.
[01:26:01.069 --> 01:26:01.970]  Oh yeah, they're all in it.
[01:26:02.310 --> 01:26:03.552]  The stuff's manufactured over there.
[01:26:03.792 --> 01:26:05.734]  They go home to visit their families.
[01:26:06.235 --> 01:26:09.078]  They go home to set up things.
[01:26:09.098 --> 01:26:12.001]  Some of them go home and set up their own factory.
[01:26:13.062 --> 01:26:14.423]  So what is the big deal?
[01:26:14.443 --> 01:26:18.508]  You know, if we're going to hire all these, the rest of the world to build our stuff here,
[01:26:19.690 --> 01:26:21.631]  Then they know what's going on.
[01:26:21.811 --> 01:26:23.752]  You don't have to worry about it being stolen.
[01:26:23.892 --> 01:26:25.273]  You've already given it away.
[01:26:25.293 --> 01:26:25.753]  That's right.
[01:26:26.194 --> 01:26:27.054]  The hardware.
[01:26:27.274 --> 01:26:29.455]  The Pentagon comes out and says, we want to know what you're thinking.
[01:26:29.916 --> 01:26:31.716]  Five years ago, we're tracking everything you do.
[01:26:31.957 --> 01:26:34.038]  We have a computer that has a model of the world in it.
[01:26:35.138 --> 01:26:37.980]  The head of the CIA says, your dishwasher is watching you.
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:38.800]  We're listening to you.
[01:26:39.761 --> 01:26:41.722]  But then Snowden says it's a bad idea.
[01:26:41.882 --> 01:26:42.542]  Oh, he's a traitor.
[01:26:42.862 --> 01:26:45.064]  What he's a traitor for is saying it's bad.
[01:26:45.564 --> 01:26:47.265]  That's the real underlying message.
[01:26:49.462 --> 01:26:50.502]  Do you agree with that statement?
[01:26:50.822 --> 01:26:51.343]  Well, yes.
[01:26:52.103 --> 01:27:04.227]  I say that the government on the highest levels is afraid they're going to get overthrown of all the corrupt and dirty deals they're involved in.
[01:27:05.836 --> 01:27:12.619]  The other night I watched a film on the amount of money that was covered up was being handled in the World Trade Center.
[01:27:12.659 --> 01:27:19.722]  There were billions of dollars that were lost from the books because... Billions in gold disappeared out of the bottom.
[01:27:20.383 --> 01:27:29.947]  And so there were thousands of people killed and billions of dollars worth of the property destroyed just to cover that up.
[01:27:31.243 --> 01:27:31.943]  How shameful.
[01:27:32.223 --> 01:27:33.884]  And no real investigation.
[01:27:33.944 --> 01:27:44.689]  In fact, now I'm told, or I've heard that in the anniversary coming up, they don't want any of the firefighters and the New York City Police down.
[01:27:44.969 --> 01:27:45.909]  Oh no, that's two in a row.
[01:27:45.929 --> 01:27:46.570]  They're not allowed.
[01:27:46.990 --> 01:27:47.790]  Yeah, not allowed.
[01:27:48.311 --> 01:27:49.711]  How absolutely ridiculous.
[01:27:49.731 --> 01:27:55.414]  Well, look at how the, it's not just the Secretary of Defense, but top generals now won't be around troops with guns.
[01:27:56.254 --> 01:27:58.195]  I mean, but again, this is all planned.
[01:27:59.015 --> 01:28:00.576]  This is all planned, what they're doing.
[01:28:01.974 --> 01:28:05.356]  Well, just like the gun-free school zones.
[01:28:05.757 --> 01:28:08.118]  You don't bring a gun around a Roman emperor.
[01:28:08.819 --> 01:28:10.480]  You don't bring a gun around a general.
[01:28:11.020 --> 01:28:14.483]  I'm telling you, this is an enemy force, so of course they hate the military.
[01:28:14.503 --> 01:28:18.906]  I mean, that's why I can't even get mad at cops when they run around and act like psycho goons.
[01:28:19.146 --> 01:28:20.407]  They've been trained we're the enemy.
[01:28:20.687 --> 01:28:25.350]  They've been given paramilitary training, occupation training, and they think this is normal.
[01:28:25.670 --> 01:28:27.091]  They think this is how they go home at night.
[01:28:27.512 --> 01:28:29.213]  Instead, it's gearing them up for a civil war.
[01:28:30.540 --> 01:28:33.364]  Do you have any idea how many cops are going to get wiped out when they start this thing?
[01:28:33.805 --> 01:28:34.967]  And I'm not happy about it.
[01:28:36.469 --> 01:28:43.880]  It's going to be very nasty if they start it, but one of the things that irks me right now, they're very quick to use their weapons.
[01:28:44.621 --> 01:28:46.023]  Well, they're wearing body armor.
[01:28:46.943 --> 01:28:48.463]  They're pretty well-protected.
[01:28:49.404 --> 01:28:51.444]  No, I mean, they now shoot people every day.
[01:28:51.504 --> 01:28:54.184]  I see articles where a guy gets out and has a pen in his hand.
[01:28:54.905 --> 01:29:02.206]  It's instinctive shooting, which I get makes you a good shot, but the thing is, you know, you've got a weight belt in your car, they shoot you in the head.
[01:29:02.486 --> 01:29:04.987]  You get out with your license and it glimmers, they shoot you.
[01:29:05.007 --> 01:29:05.587]  They don't even think.
[01:29:05.627 --> 01:29:08.467]  It's like, you know, okay, corral.
[01:29:08.687 --> 01:29:16.129]  They're not in that much danger unless their perpetrator is going to make a headshot on them, which you'd probably need a high-powered rifle to do.
[01:29:17.955 --> 01:29:19.236]  You really can't kill one.
[01:29:19.736 --> 01:29:21.477]  Well, it's not even an issue now.
[01:29:22.717 --> 01:29:28.120]  If you look statistically, it's car wrecks that are killing cops, but they're all walking around absolutely scared to death they're about to be killed.
[01:29:28.140 --> 01:29:29.460]  But Raymond, we've got to get to the NASA news.
[01:29:29.981 --> 01:29:30.261]  Okay.
[01:29:30.761 --> 01:29:34.563]  I know it's hard for you to talk about this stuff, but I want you to tell me what you told me the other day.
[01:29:34.803 --> 01:29:35.123]  Okay.
[01:29:35.543 --> 01:29:36.123]  We're going to break.
[01:29:36.163 --> 01:29:39.605]  We're going to get you an earpiece so you can actually hear, because I know that it's confusing when the breaks are.
[01:29:39.825 --> 01:29:40.926]  We're going to come right back with
[01:29:42.106 --> 01:29:49.190]  Insider, Air Force Intelligence, NSA connected, frontline NASA, you name it.
[01:29:50.951 --> 01:29:53.933]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.873 --> 01:29:57.555]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:31:01.385 --> 01:31:05.969]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[01:31:06.129 --> 01:31:09.072]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[01:31:09.232 --> 01:31:14.476]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[01:31:14.797 --> 01:31:16.458]  It all comes down to one thing.
[01:31:16.738 --> 01:31:18.059]  We are what we eat.
[01:31:18.360 --> 01:31:18.780]  Our food.
[01:31:18.780 --> 01:31:22.704]  Food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[01:31:23.025 --> 01:31:27.029]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[01:31:27.249 --> 01:31:29.572]  All of this has been engineered by design.

[01:32:01.370 --> 01:32:04.971]  Are we choosing our own destiny, or has it been pre-selected for us?
[01:32:05.231 --> 01:32:10.513]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[01:32:10.753 --> 01:32:18.296]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[01:32:18.476 --> 01:32:27.579]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[01:32:27.799 --> 01:32:34.821]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[01:32:34.961 --> 01:32:37.822]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[01:32:37.842 --> 01:32:44.765]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse but demand a war.
[01:32:46.961 --> 01:32:47.821]  The plane just hit!
[01:33:07.278 --> 01:33:11.803]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:33:12.824 --> 01:33:15.427]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:19.824 --> 01:33:24.248]  You know, I had to twist his arm a little bit to get Raymond to come in here and talk about this.
[01:33:24.288 --> 01:33:28.933]  He's always, you know, privately talking about stuff, nothing classified, but just things that he's able to speak about.
[01:33:28.993 --> 01:33:30.735]  It's always amazing, and I said, you gotta come in.
[01:33:30.755 --> 01:33:34.679]  So what's gonna happen is, we've got Professor Griff coming up, I've got a bunch of news I need to get to.
[01:33:35.500 --> 01:33:37.442]  Raymond is gonna be on the nightly news tonight.
[01:33:37.482 --> 01:33:38.322]  I'm not sure who he's hosting.
[01:33:38.382 --> 01:33:42.166]  Is it Jakari Jackson, Robb Dew, Darren McBreen, is it David Knight?
[01:33:43.087 --> 01:33:44.267]  I'm not sure who's doing it tonight.
[01:33:45.267 --> 01:33:51.448]  Watson was scheduled, but Watson's going to be co-hosting Friday all three hours, so he's not doing tonight.
[01:33:52.109 --> 01:34:02.330]  But Raymond says he's up to do it, to really talk for 30-40 minutes, commercial-free during the interview, to just get into Snowden, NASA, and really kind of let him just roll with it.
[01:34:02.730 --> 01:34:10.612]  So we're going to get that set up right now for InfoWars Nightly News, 7 o'clock tonight, Central, with Raymond Teague.
[01:34:10.652 --> 01:34:12.052]  We'll go tape that right after this show.
[01:34:13.012 --> 01:34:13.472]  Today.
[01:34:14.593 --> 01:34:17.256]  Raymond, for those that just joined us, you were a NASA engineer.
[01:34:17.276 --> 01:34:20.398]  We can put up the photo of you on the Apollo missions front line.
[01:34:21.139 --> 01:34:22.941]  You know, they're running a lot of the systems.
[01:34:23.261 --> 01:34:25.803]  You were then over the cameras on the shuttle program.
[01:34:26.243 --> 01:34:29.286]  You obviously did some other classified programs that you can't talk about.
[01:34:30.067 --> 01:34:32.089]  But you were getting into the NSA.
[01:34:32.149 --> 01:34:35.852]  Now we're segueing into, because I took it from what you told me years ago that
[01:34:37.150 --> 01:34:38.651]  Look to you like it went to the moon.
[01:34:39.092 --> 01:34:39.612]  Look to you.
[01:34:39.672 --> 01:34:41.854]  You know, you later worked at RCA Corporation as well.
[01:34:41.894 --> 01:34:42.795]  They had cameras there.
[01:34:43.615 --> 01:34:51.482]  But then later you said you could see how, well, I mean, say it in your own words, that they could fake this.
[01:34:52.042 --> 01:34:55.305]  Just like on NORAD, they were having a simulation of the very thing happening.
[01:34:56.066 --> 01:35:03.392]  Raymond, again, tell people how many Apollo programs you worked on and what your gut level is and then what that Russian engineer you were friends with told you.
[01:35:05.066 --> 01:35:10.628]  Well, I've been asked this before, even on this program, and by many people.
[01:35:12.289 --> 01:35:13.810]  Did we actually go to the moon?
[01:35:15.290 --> 01:35:21.673]  And I would say, well, yes, I believe we did, but I cannot be absolutely sure.
[01:35:22.313 --> 01:35:27.935]  And the reason I can't be absolutely sure, from things I've seen and can relate to, you would be certain that we did.
[01:35:28.876 --> 01:35:33.998]  But at the same time, from other things I've seen go on, we might not have.
[01:35:34.884 --> 01:35:45.490]  Now, one of the many instances, I worked with a patriotic Russian engineer on a solid state program for a company here.
[01:35:46.010 --> 01:35:46.950]  There's a camera over there, brother.
[01:35:46.970 --> 01:35:47.351]  Look at them.
[01:35:48.251 --> 01:35:48.571]  Okay.
[01:35:49.632 --> 01:35:53.914]  So, and we became pretty good friends.
[01:35:53.994 --> 01:35:59.457]  Anyway, discussing things like this, he told me, no, you did not go to the moon.
[01:36:00.337 --> 01:36:01.598]  It was all staged.
[01:36:02.459 --> 01:36:02.639]  Well,
[01:36:03.655 --> 01:36:06.437]  I don't see how we would have staged Apollo 13.
[01:36:06.577 --> 01:36:19.244]  Whoever put that one together would be the ultimate in suspense adventure writing if they put the mission Apollo 13 together because there were just too many things to be thought of and too many details.
[01:36:20.299 --> 01:36:20.879]  The rest of it.
[01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:25.083]  But they've now leaked that there's dead Russians on the moon and all sorts of disasters.
[01:36:25.103 --> 01:36:37.192]  A lot of... I've been told by high-level people off-record that there's a large, not just hundreds of deaths in secret space plane programs, but hundreds of deaths, and you add them up, it's even more than that, in secret space programs.
[01:36:37.212 --> 01:36:39.654]  I mean, it's admitted there's a secret space program.
[01:36:39.694 --> 01:36:40.915]  Bob Bowman's talked about that.
[01:36:41.275 --> 01:36:43.037]  Were you involved in any of the secret space program?
[01:36:45.194 --> 01:36:45.854]  No, not really.
[01:36:45.874 --> 01:37:13.370]  Now I know I've heard rumors the Russians apparently have lost quite a few people and of course we lost three on the very first one burned up right on the pad and uh... that was tragic and then of course we had uh... the Columbia accident so uh... and lost a few people but we haven't lost anywhere near what apparently the Russians have lost but they've done a lot more flying than we have so
[01:37:14.326 --> 01:37:15.588]  It's the more you fly, the more likely.
[01:37:15.628 --> 01:37:17.189]  Well, what did the Russian engineer explain to you?
[01:37:17.229 --> 01:37:23.897]  And break down, break down, you're being fed info, and you were saying they have you doing drills all the time of the same thing.
[01:37:23.937 --> 01:37:25.219]  You don't know drill from real.
[01:37:26.360 --> 01:37:31.466]  Okay, now, I think you've gotten the wrong impression on what I told you is simulated.
[01:37:31.486 --> 01:37:32.707]  Well, explain it, explain it, yeah.
[01:37:32.727 --> 01:37:32.928]  Okay.
[01:37:33.991 --> 01:37:48.254]  Alright, let's say you're in a simulator that amounts to your personal car and you're driving down the highway and now you've got controllers that put problems in there that you're supposed to solve in order to be able to keep your driver's license whenever.
[01:37:48.274 --> 01:37:54.336]  Let's say you're tooling off down the highway here and all of a sudden you get an oil pressure light.
[01:37:54.596 --> 01:37:55.916]  Your oil pressure is gone.
[01:37:57.437 --> 01:38:02.318]  This means you've got fifteen seconds or less to save your engine if you're going to
[01:38:03.803 --> 01:38:05.224]  Solve the engine problem.
[01:38:05.264 --> 01:38:09.728]  You've got to shut the engine down almost immediately, otherwise it's going to be ruined.
[01:38:10.990 --> 01:38:19.317]  Now, if you're not going to lose any altitude, and probably not crash if you lose oil pressure in your car, but it requires instant reaction.
[01:38:19.377 --> 01:38:25.643]  Well, on the spacecraft, there are systems, many systems that might get you killed.
[01:38:25.743 --> 01:38:27.524]  You might wind up with no oxygen.
[01:38:28.416 --> 01:38:28.956]  No power.
[01:38:29.357 --> 01:38:31.398]  Too high a level of CO2.
[01:38:32.039 --> 01:38:33.840]  There's lots of life support involved.
[01:38:34.301 --> 01:38:38.945]  And if the system goes out and you take no action, then you will wind up dead.
[01:38:40.125 --> 01:38:42.888]  And this was part of the big problem on Apollo 13.
[01:38:42.948 --> 01:38:54.657]  The oxygen canisters, or the CO2 removal canisters on the command module did not fit the ones on the LM, the lunar module.
[01:38:55.118 --> 01:38:57.159]  And they had to do a big
[01:39:00.372 --> 01:39:01.774]  What were you doing on Apollo 13?
[01:39:18.032 --> 01:39:23.457]  They said the first thing I did was call in all the rest of our our troop and everybody else did the same.
[01:39:23.718 --> 01:39:27.882]  So we had three shifts in the mission control room at one time.
[01:39:27.902 --> 01:39:29.123]  Not only that,
[01:39:30.885 --> 01:39:45.893]  They called in the people that were the support people that did the training that called in all of their people to figure out what to do to get around power supply problems, air filtration problems, and it had to be done with stuff that was on board.
[01:39:45.933 --> 01:39:53.917]  They had to use duct tape and cardboard and so forth to make adapters to get these to work.
[01:39:53.977 --> 01:39:54.798]  So you worked on that?
[01:39:57.816 --> 01:40:00.438]  We were in a tremendous position at that time.
[01:40:01.178 --> 01:40:10.643]  The three people I worked with on guidance and control, we monitored the guidance system and the state vectors, in other words, the directions.
[01:40:10.663 --> 01:40:18.608]  And didn't they have like radio telescopes and things and radio trackers to be able to, I mean, certainly the spacecraft went out to the moon.
[01:40:20.346 --> 01:40:27.988]  You had three different stations around the world that kept track of all, that sent and received all the communications and the data.
[01:40:28.649 --> 01:40:31.269]  Sure, because from the evidence I've seen, I believe it went to the moon as well.
[01:40:31.549 --> 01:40:36.131]  From the intel I've got, though, is that there was a whole nother secret mission there as backup.
[01:40:36.651 --> 01:40:36.831]  No.
[01:40:37.591 --> 01:40:38.832]  And so that's not going on?
[01:40:39.152 --> 01:40:40.132]  No, there was not.
[01:40:40.312 --> 01:40:42.132]  Okay, well then how could it have been fake then?
[01:40:42.873 --> 01:40:43.773]  Just devil's advocate?
[01:40:45.353 --> 01:40:59.205]  Well, if you're sitting in a room here and you see a display of instrumentation, like all the, say, the instrumentation on your car, your gas gauge, your... Sure, they can feed bad info into that.
[01:40:59.765 --> 01:41:04.790]  Yes, they can control all the info and make you believe that something else is going on.
[01:41:05.210 --> 01:41:06.891]  But in this case, that was not the case.
[01:41:06.932 --> 01:41:10.755]  But they'd have to have a whole other room of other engineers to know how to fool engineers.
[01:41:13.259 --> 01:41:13.699]  They did.
[01:41:13.780 --> 01:41:27.366]  They had the whole bottom floor of the IBM 360 computers plus all these staff support rooms and part of them were devoted to putting in the problems to train us to recognize when you had a problem.
[01:41:28.106 --> 01:41:31.688]  Now, let me finish on what I was going to tell you.
[01:41:34.389 --> 01:41:36.650]  The navigation system did not go down.
[01:41:38.052 --> 01:41:44.095]  When the oxygen tank blew up, it knocked the fuel cell power generators offline.
[01:41:45.176 --> 01:41:47.457]  And so, and it blew most of the circuit breakers.
[01:41:48.658 --> 01:41:58.063]  But what happened was, just like in an aircraft, if you're familiar with aircraft operations, you have an endless stream of
[01:41:59.068 --> 01:42:01.110]  Emergency procedures you're supposed to follow.
[01:42:01.150 --> 01:42:10.461]  You pick out what seems to be the most appropriate and you start going down a checklist and checking things off to see where you are in the system, how your system is working.
[01:42:10.981 --> 01:42:13.324]  Well, this was absolutely endless in Apollo.
[01:42:13.424 --> 01:42:14.445]  They had everything.
[01:42:15.026 --> 01:42:19.231]  But they didn't have this because this was not something that was supposed to be survivable.
[01:42:20.561 --> 01:42:21.342]  And what happened?
[01:42:21.362 --> 01:42:22.382]  They lost all the power.
[01:42:23.203 --> 01:42:28.847]  Well, they were afraid just to turn all the circuit breakers back on because it might all go up in flames.
[01:42:29.648 --> 01:42:30.528]  They didn't know what was wrong.
[01:42:32.029 --> 01:42:48.681]  So, about 45 minutes later, when they finally found out what the problem really was, they got the right circuit breakers on to show that the systems engineer monitoring the fuel cells and the oxygen, hydrogen levels, found and said, Flight, we've got
[01:42:50.306 --> 01:42:52.849]  30 minutes of power left.
[01:42:53.751 --> 01:42:56.955]  He came back 10 minutes later and said, we've got less than 10 minutes.
[01:42:58.319 --> 01:43:04.100]  Well, this was a disaster, because without the power on and the nav system running, there was no chance.
[01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:06.161]  And this was being kept secret from the public?
[01:43:06.441 --> 01:43:07.001]  No, it wasn't.
[01:43:08.021 --> 01:43:13.683]  At the time, it wasn't broadcast, but the whole movie... No, no, you're not giving anything secret out on that.
[01:43:13.743 --> 01:43:14.343]  I got it, Raymond.
[01:43:14.363 --> 01:43:16.783]  All you're doing is trying to not give anything secret out.
[01:43:16.823 --> 01:43:18.364]  Now, what about the suicide pills?
[01:43:18.884 --> 01:43:20.604]  What was the procedure if they were going to die?
[01:43:20.624 --> 01:43:22.105]  Just wait and suffocate or take pills?
[01:43:23.425 --> 01:43:25.465]  I never heard anything about the suicide pills.
[01:43:26.566 --> 01:43:27.566]  They may have had some.
[01:43:28.707 --> 01:43:49.644]  Um, but actually running out of oxygen, um, if you're in a, if you're in a pressure system, for instance, you just go to sleep, you will take, uh, about three or four breaths and you and you will be passed out and you will never know what happened to you.
[01:43:50.064 --> 01:43:53.867]  You will not know, you will not feel it coming and you will not know what happened.
[01:43:55.373 --> 01:44:11.521]  uh... that's part of the problems and what happened on some of the uh... spatial accidents and that's facial well even that the people they purge areas with nitrogen to get uh... hydrazine out of it make sure there's no hydrazine left.
[01:44:11.541 --> 01:44:12.322]  But then it lingers.
[01:44:13.482 --> 01:44:14.203]  Well the oxygen
[01:44:15.293 --> 01:44:27.265]  The normal air is 78% nitrogen but if you went in there too quick or didn't have enough oxygen to put in or wearing a scuba system to supply your air or oxygen
[01:44:28.493 --> 01:44:29.334]  Then you would die.
[01:44:29.354 --> 01:44:29.994]  Wow.
[01:44:30.515 --> 01:44:32.116]  Well, Raymond, we're almost out of time.
[01:44:32.136 --> 01:44:34.017]  You're going to be able to talk about whatever you want on the nightly news tonight.
[01:44:34.057 --> 01:44:34.918]  A really interesting guy.
[01:44:34.938 --> 01:44:37.600]  Again, a good friend of mine for 15 years joining us here.
[01:44:38.180 --> 01:44:45.166]  Specifically then, you're saying they could have been feeding you guys fake data, but then weren't there other governments and things?
[01:44:45.926 --> 01:44:52.711]  Also, they do this mirror test now where they fire a laser from the observatory out in West Texas and hit the mirrors on the moon.
[01:44:52.972 --> 01:44:56.955]  But then I guess the argument there is they could have a satellite with a robot, like Viking,
[01:44:57.655 --> 01:45:23.981]  uh... place mirrors okay i haven't there's a the Apollo 13 was on a non-free return uh... orbit it would crash into the moon if you did not make a maneuver to circularize your your entry into lunar orbit so they had to make a burn and shut it down but anyway they're running out of power and the nav systems were going down
[01:45:26.721 --> 01:45:37.544]  Normally we would verify the data once, mainly the locking ring mechanism between the command module and the lunar module.
[01:45:38.244 --> 01:45:46.846]  There were marks on it, and you had to align these, and normally we'd run them three times, read them three times, make sure everything was absolutely perfect before committing.
[01:45:47.946 --> 01:45:51.247]  We did it once, very rapidly.
[01:45:51.287 --> 01:45:52.828]  Committing is firing thrusters?
[01:45:55.540 --> 01:46:02.402]  They used the Limla motor to make this because the CSM, there was something wrong with it, but we didn't know what.
[01:46:02.943 --> 01:46:05.344]  And that's the normal actuators?
[01:46:06.804 --> 01:46:14.287]  No, this was the normal, the command module had a large motor on it that was mainly used... No, no, I got it!
[01:46:14.667 --> 01:46:16.428]  They couldn't use the normal thruster controls.
[01:46:16.448 --> 01:46:19.409]  Yes, this was an alternative... So they used the main engine, right?
[01:46:20.549 --> 01:46:22.770]  Well, they used the landing engine for the...
[01:46:23.942 --> 01:46:27.946]  That was intended to lower the... So what's the bottom line?
[01:46:27.966 --> 01:46:28.567]  We're going to break.
[01:46:29.408 --> 01:46:32.571]  Okay, the bottom line was only God brought us back.
[01:46:32.691 --> 01:46:38.337]  We never expected anybody to get back from this because the problems were so immense.
[01:46:40.199 --> 01:46:45.761]  You had to do it with enormous accuracy when they did it pretty... Why haven't we gone back to the moon?
[01:46:45.781 --> 01:46:47.782]  Because, look, I know there's a lot of suppressed technology.
[01:46:48.222 --> 01:46:50.883]  They've got Black Manta, space planes, Dr. Bob Bowman.
[01:46:50.903 --> 01:47:05.427]  This is one of the big problems when Robert Rack McNamara, and I don't know what he had, anyhow, he ordered the drawings and all the tooling for the Saturn V rocket destroyed.
[01:47:05.588 --> 01:47:06.148]  I saw that.
[01:47:07.108 --> 01:47:09.509]  Well, when he... Which was really Wernher von Braun's design.
[01:47:11.323 --> 01:47:21.130]  Anybody, I mean everyone, all of the NASA people were in shock because they knew that before they had anything else to fly with, it would be 10 years.
[01:47:21.170 --> 01:47:24.612]  So a lot of them... And we're still using the Russian Heavy Booster, right?
[01:47:25.292 --> 01:47:25.813]  That's right.
[01:47:26.653 --> 01:47:31.096]  And I mean, this was treason of the highest order.
[01:47:31.357 --> 01:47:34.178]  They just literally abandoned the space program.
[01:47:34.218 --> 01:47:36.500]  Well, they had enough rockets to fly through Apollo 17.
[01:47:39.594 --> 01:47:40.515]  Already manufactured.
[01:47:40.835 --> 01:47:44.117]  But at the same time, and this was done during 12.
[01:47:46.239 --> 01:47:49.681]  So this was one of the strange things.
[01:47:49.761 --> 01:47:52.383]  It seemed like they wanted to bail out of the space program.
[01:47:52.403 --> 01:47:55.065]  The government wanted to bail out of the Apollo program.
[01:47:55.085 --> 01:47:57.467]  I can tell you why.
[01:47:57.927 --> 01:48:00.089]  The decision was made then to go with robots.
[01:48:01.253 --> 01:48:02.653]  Man isn't going to go into space.
[01:48:02.693 --> 01:48:03.453]  We're going nowhere.
[01:48:04.174 --> 01:48:04.534]  It's over.
[01:48:04.554 --> 01:48:06.414]  The elite believe they're going to merge with machines.
[01:48:06.454 --> 01:48:07.354]  They all say this.
[01:48:07.934 --> 01:48:10.455]  And that they're not going to... The idea of us going to space, it's over.
[01:48:10.895 --> 01:48:20.717]  The decision's been made to bring in the world government, bring in the technocracy, release the bio-weapons, kill everybody, and the elite are going to merge with the machines, which of course is a lie of Lucifer.
[01:48:21.037 --> 01:48:22.517]  They're not going to be given eternal life either.
[01:48:22.957 --> 01:48:23.997]  But they all say that.
[01:48:24.057 --> 01:48:25.198]  That's their actual plan.
[01:48:25.218 --> 01:48:27.078]  That's why they killed the real space program.
[01:48:27.318 --> 01:48:31.902]  Well, they killed the real space program when they destroyed the tooling for building the rocket.
[01:48:32.383 --> 01:48:33.003]  Well, here's an example.
[01:48:33.043 --> 01:48:37.567]  Wernher von Braun came up with the space shuttle idea in 1935 in Germany when he was the head of the rocket program.
[01:48:37.907 --> 01:48:41.931]  He came up with the Saturn program around then and was able to then deploy it.
[01:48:41.971 --> 01:48:44.113]  A genius, though he was a Nazi.
[01:48:44.573 --> 01:48:47.136]  And now we can't even have stuff that good?
[01:48:47.896 --> 01:48:51.940]  Again, they've frozen our development while they have an advanced development.
[01:48:51.960 --> 01:48:54.142]  That's what Bowman, who was the head of the Star Wars program, says.
[01:48:55.441 --> 01:49:04.487]  He said when he was the head of the program in the late seventies, before they even announced it, they already had hundreds of unmanned decapitation weapons in space with DU-SABOs.
[01:49:05.107 --> 01:49:05.767]  Meteor guns.
[01:49:06.468 --> 01:49:09.950]  And he said he could only say that because they'd accidentally declassified part of that.
[01:49:10.811 --> 01:49:12.552]  Did you ever know anything about any of that, Raymond?
[01:49:12.612 --> 01:49:13.692]  No, I didn't know anything about that.
[01:49:14.313 --> 01:49:20.477]  What seems strange, not only did we eliminate our capability to go into space, and at least in a visible way,
[01:49:21.656 --> 01:49:30.922]  Um, we've never looked back at the hardware that was left on the moon with, uh, that could be done with, uh... Well, here's the issue.
[01:49:31.002 --> 01:49:33.464]  Why not just focus telescopes up there and show all the wreckage?
[01:49:33.784 --> 01:49:36.926]  There's enough private telescopes in the landing zones.
[01:49:37.767 --> 01:49:41.349]  Uh, I mean, what, you could do that with, like, a three-foot refractor on a mountaintop?
[01:49:41.389 --> 01:49:42.430]  No, I don't think so.
[01:49:42.550 --> 01:49:45.192]  But, uh, with the, um... I don't know.
[01:49:45.212 --> 01:49:46.973]  With digital photography, they could blow it up.
[01:49:48.114 --> 01:49:51.275]  I'm trying to think of the satellite normally that does all the star pictures.
[01:49:51.295 --> 01:49:51.595]  Hubble.
[01:49:51.875 --> 01:49:52.395]  Hubble, yes.
[01:49:52.455 --> 01:49:56.856]  With Hubble, you should be able to pick up the... Yeah, aiming at the moon landing site, and there you have it.
[01:49:56.876 --> 01:50:02.777]  Flags and other hardware that were left on the surface should be able to see that, and I'm surprised that none of that has been done.
[01:50:02.817 --> 01:50:09.359]  They've never admitted going... Yeah, have the public in, let them see the readout, or soon they'd say they just faked the feed.
[01:50:12.253 --> 01:50:16.195]  So, anyhow, it's strange that we've never gone back.
[01:50:16.236 --> 01:50:17.836]  We've never... What does your gut tell you?
[01:50:17.857 --> 01:50:19.978]  I mean, you worked on the Apollo program, frontline.
[01:50:19.998 --> 01:50:20.978]  What does your gut tell you, Raymond?
[01:50:21.439 --> 01:50:29.844]  I would say that the shuttle program has been a cover for what is actually going on, and I don't know what's going on.
[01:50:30.024 --> 01:50:34.187]  Except, it does not make sense that they threw all this capability away.
[01:50:35.544 --> 01:50:37.425]  And we've done nothing since then.
[01:50:37.826 --> 01:50:39.307]  Well see, America's not meant to have that.
[01:50:39.327 --> 01:50:41.208]  Looks like we gave the Panama Canal to the Chinese.
[01:50:41.548 --> 01:50:42.409]  We're being sold out.
[01:50:42.449 --> 01:50:43.429]  I'm going to explain that when we come back.
[01:50:43.690 --> 01:50:47.212]  Raymond, you're going to have the floor tonight on the Nightly News.
[01:50:47.232 --> 01:50:49.473]  I want you to really get into this 7 o'clock.
[01:50:49.513 --> 01:50:50.374]  And thanks for coming in, buddy.
[01:50:51.235 --> 01:50:51.575]  OK.
[01:50:51.835 --> 01:50:52.736]  It's always good to see you.
[01:50:53.944 --> 01:50:54.525]  Raymond, man.
[01:50:54.885 --> 01:50:56.686]  Raymond Teague worked with him for a couple years.
[01:50:57.106 --> 01:50:57.907]  He's a great guy.
[01:50:57.927 --> 01:50:59.068]  We'll be right back.
[01:50:59.128 --> 01:50:59.868]  I'm Alex Jones.

[01:54:15.492 --> 01:54:22.918]  The interest is up and the stock market's down and you're only getting mugged if you go downtown.
[01:54:27.121 --> 01:54:29.643]  I live back in the woods, you see.
[01:54:30.063 --> 01:54:32.465]  A woman and the kids and the dogs and me.
[01:54:33.942 --> 01:54:36.763]  Raymond Teague's a great guy, Alex Jones here back live.
[01:54:39.185 --> 01:54:45.908]  But every time I start getting him on air to talk about stuff he won't talk about most of it.
[01:54:46.948 --> 01:54:52.251]  And that's just the conditioning of all the programs he was involved in, secret programs.
[01:54:54.552 --> 01:54:57.914]  He starts shaking a little bit when he starts to talk about it.
[01:54:57.954 --> 01:55:00.175]  And it's not like he's telling me secret stuff when he's here.
[01:55:01.778 --> 01:55:06.986]  I mean, he was ready to not even tell people they kept Apollo 13 disaster secret for a few hours.
[01:55:07.627 --> 01:55:11.793]  In case the astronauts died, they wanted to be able to, you know, announce it so their families wouldn't be freaked out.
[01:55:12.234 --> 01:55:14.437]  He was ready to not even talk about that.
[01:55:15.018 --> 01:55:16.320]  Because I said, you kept that secret?
[01:55:16.340 --> 01:55:17.201]  He's like, uh...
[01:55:19.694 --> 01:55:20.174]  Oh, Raymond.
[01:55:20.314 --> 01:55:21.795]  Raymond's a really smart guy, I tell you.
[01:55:21.815 --> 01:55:22.395]  Really interesting.
[01:55:22.815 --> 01:55:24.236]  Fun guy to go shooting with as well.
[01:55:24.896 --> 01:55:26.097]  Okay, here's what's going on.
[01:55:26.177 --> 01:55:34.021]  This kind of stuff always happens, dealing with rock bands, rock groups, rap groups, to the point of I almost tell the crew, it's like, stop trying to set these interviews up.
[01:55:34.561 --> 01:55:39.843]  You know, if they fall in our lap, I'll do them, but I'm not really interested, you know, in it.
[01:55:39.903 --> 01:55:43.505]  I was out yesterday and ran into a movie star and didn't even try to talk to him or interview him.
[01:55:45.595 --> 01:55:51.417]  I like Professor Grip because he's interesting and he's informed and I'd like to get LL Cool J's take on something and Ice Cube.
[01:55:51.437 --> 01:55:52.858]  We'll end up probably getting that tonight.
[01:55:54.359 --> 01:56:01.261]  They left a little late and thought they'd already be here from Dallas and I was like, they're 30 minutes out an hour ago?
[01:56:01.742 --> 01:56:04.303]  Turns out they're like in Temple right now.
[01:56:05.243 --> 01:56:07.985]  And I guess they're gonna try to go drop Griff off here or something.
[01:56:08.326 --> 01:56:09.386]  Who knows what'll happen?
[01:56:10.567 --> 01:56:11.928]  So I'm not even worried about it.
[01:56:12.629 --> 01:56:18.614]  But it'll either happen in overdrive today, some stations carry the fourth hour, or it'll be on the nightly news, or it won't happen.
[01:56:18.874 --> 01:56:20.055]  I'm not, you know, one way or the other.
[01:56:20.335 --> 01:56:22.757]  We have a great interview with Professor Griff coming up for the Obama Deception 2.
[01:56:23.538 --> 01:56:27.501]  But they're coming to town and wanted to come in, so we'll see what happens.
[01:56:29.285 --> 01:56:34.788]  That said, I mean, to me the big news is the Russian troops in America to patrol the American people.
[01:56:35.628 --> 01:56:40.851]  And now I will start that in the second segment, when some stations join us, in the next hour.
[01:56:41.451 --> 01:56:46.014]  I will start that big presentation, what's behind it, the history of it, all of it then.
[01:56:46.414 --> 01:56:50.416]  It's kind of a good thing I got behind it and they got behind it because this is really the big enchilada.
[01:56:51.052 --> 01:56:54.135]  You want to understand everything else, you've got to understand this.
[01:56:54.155 --> 01:57:02.822]  Because remember, all the crazy old-timers, that crazy uncle who was a retired army colonel, you know, that you know, said they were going to bring in Russian troops, and why?
[01:57:03.443 --> 01:57:04.464]  Why, he's nuts!
[01:57:05.464 --> 01:57:11.930]  And, oh, the NSA spied on us, you know, your crazy dad said, oh, but he worked in the government, but wouldn't say where.
[01:57:12.871 --> 01:57:17.635]  We had patriots, folks, when this whole plan was rolled out, who warned everybody.
[01:57:19.181 --> 01:57:20.102]  And now, we're here.
[01:57:21.002 --> 01:57:22.804]  So, you better listen next hour.
[01:57:22.964 --> 01:57:23.604]  That's all I'm saying.
[01:57:23.765 --> 01:57:27.587]  I'll spend one segment on this, and then I'm gonna get into Obama's compulsory service stuff.
[01:57:27.608 --> 01:57:28.468]  They're calling up again.
[01:57:28.488 --> 01:57:33.672]  I'm gonna get into this incredible video of the guy filming police from like 67 yards away.
[01:57:34.032 --> 01:57:35.674]  They come and arrest him, manhandling.
[01:57:35.994 --> 01:57:38.156]  His dog jumps out of the window, runs over, they shoot it.
[01:57:38.496 --> 01:57:41.378]  And the police say, we thought the dog was gonna attack you.
[01:57:41.538 --> 01:57:46.442]  I mean, and again, I'm not here to even... If I just bash the police, that helps the New World Order.
[01:57:46.482 --> 01:57:48.443]  Because that puts them more into their gang mentality.
[01:57:49.504 --> 01:57:53.048]  I want to reach out to the police and explain the brainwashing they're under.
[01:57:53.108 --> 01:57:54.369]  It ties into the Russian troops.
[01:57:54.389 --> 01:57:58.533]  I'm going to break all this down and show you the source documents on this, okay?
[01:57:59.354 --> 01:58:00.035]  Not rumors.
[01:58:00.655 --> 01:58:01.156]  The plan.
[01:58:01.476 --> 01:58:02.957]  That print me NLE09.
[01:58:02.977 --> 01:58:04.239]  Just type in FEMA NLE09.
[01:58:04.399 --> 01:58:05.740]  It was on their site for two years.
[01:58:05.760 --> 01:58:07.222]  They pulled it, but there's screenshots of it.
[01:58:07.262 --> 01:58:07.462]  Thanks.
[01:58:09.091 --> 01:58:10.312]  I forgot that as an exhibit.
[01:58:10.532 --> 01:58:12.194]  Briefly, we're going to break in 30 seconds.
[01:58:12.474 --> 01:58:16.698]  If you believe in this show, the enemy wants it shut down and is doing dirty tricks that I won't even get into.

[02:00:06.260 --> 02:00:10.421]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:11.081 --> 02:00:11.901]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.681 --> 02:00:13.582]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.242 --> 02:00:17.863]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.423 --> 02:00:22.524]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:27.905 --> 02:00:32.866]  More details have come out on the FBI's plan to kill the leaders of the Occupy Movement.
[02:00:34.192 --> 02:00:35.413]  Political assassination.
[02:00:35.973 --> 02:00:36.574]  That's public.
[02:00:36.594 --> 02:00:37.434]  Nobody's getting in trouble.
[02:00:37.895 --> 02:00:40.456]  Greenwald, new NSA bombshell on the way.
[02:00:41.837 --> 02:00:45.380]  Snowden, Obama afraid of awake Americans.
[02:00:45.440 --> 02:00:47.981]  That's a Snowden article we publish at Infowars.com.
[02:00:49.262 --> 02:00:51.984]  Is Homeland Security set to arm TSA agents?
[02:00:52.544 --> 02:00:55.687]  Bush blasts Snowden, says approval only matters on election day.
[02:00:56.027 --> 02:01:00.450]  I have the video clip of... I've heard from multiple sources Bush is getting a little senile.
[02:01:01.290 --> 02:01:03.072]  Probably from all the partying he did or whatever.
[02:01:03.712 --> 02:01:09.454]  I mean, he looks like he's in great physical shape, but the old, the old, uh, the old, uh, onion, I think, is having some problems.
[02:01:10.174 --> 02:01:11.715]  The old, the old potato brain.
[02:01:11.735 --> 02:01:15.916]  Uh, Trayvon Martin supporters threaten riots, looting, observing unacquitted.
[02:01:16.476 --> 02:01:17.316]  I'm gonna be getting into that.
[02:01:17.376 --> 02:01:18.877]  Police shoot dog defending owner.
[02:01:20.171 --> 02:01:26.314]  As cops arrest him for filming them and has Washington's arrogance undone its empire.
[02:01:26.334 --> 02:01:28.795]  We're going to be getting into all of that and more.
[02:01:29.095 --> 02:01:31.316]  By the way, Michael Savage gave me a cell phone number.
[02:01:31.336 --> 02:01:32.056]  I haven't called it.
[02:01:32.556 --> 02:01:33.737]  I've emailed his producer.
[02:01:34.517 --> 02:01:38.199]  I want to get Michael Savage on about all the crazy things that are going on after the holiday.
[02:01:38.239 --> 02:01:41.580]  So to my producers, tell me to call Michael Savage.
[02:01:41.620 --> 02:01:47.463]  Speaking of that, here is a clip of Michael Savage yesterday talking about our story.
[02:01:48.743 --> 02:01:51.965]  On InfoWars.com, no doubt, from DrudgeReport.com, where he found it.
[02:01:52.305 --> 02:01:55.887]  Still up there on the right-hand side, easiest place to find it, is DrudgeReport.com.
[02:01:56.168 --> 02:02:02.551]  Here is old Michael Savage, good old Michael Savage, talking about what's really going on with all of this.
[02:02:02.571 --> 02:02:05.193]  Then we're going to come back and break down the rest of the story.
[02:02:05.493 --> 02:02:07.874]  Here's Michael Savage from his syndicated radio transmission.
[02:02:08.375 --> 02:02:10.396]  Russian soldiers will be put on U.S.
[02:02:10.436 --> 02:02:13.798]  soil by Obama to provide security at U.S.
[02:02:13.838 --> 02:02:14.138]  events.
[02:02:14.178 --> 02:02:15.479]  That's right, you heard me correctly.
[02:02:16.716 --> 02:02:19.618]  As part of a deal signed last week in Washington, D.C.
[02:02:20.058 --> 02:02:22.760]  between the Russkies and FEMA.
[02:02:23.180 --> 02:02:24.281]  You know who FEMA is, don't you?
[02:02:24.301 --> 02:02:25.882]  The people with the camps ready for you?
[02:02:27.283 --> 02:02:30.665]  Russian soldiers are going to be put on U.S.
[02:02:30.745 --> 02:02:35.208]  soil to provide security at mass events in the United States.
[02:02:36.769 --> 02:02:38.090]  Do you have any idea what this means?
[02:02:39.298 --> 02:02:44.606]  The use of foreign troops or other officials in a law enforcement capacity providing security inside the U.S.
[02:02:45.107 --> 02:02:51.556]  is illegal under Posse Comitatus, but it does not prevent this regime
[02:02:52.990 --> 02:02:54.991]  From violating the Constitution again.
[02:02:55.732 --> 02:02:59.974]  Many people fear that this government is getting ready for some major action against the people.
[02:03:00.634 --> 02:03:14.041]  They think that this gang that targeted their political enemies through the IRS and through the NSA is getting ready to use foreign troops on this, on soil, on our soil, who will not hesitate to shoot to kill.
[02:03:15.162 --> 02:03:21.986]  That was signed just last week between FEMA and Russia, the Russian Emergency Situations Ministry and FEMA.
[02:03:22.881 --> 02:03:27.086]  Where Russian soldiers will provide security at mass events in the United States.
[02:03:28.928 --> 02:03:29.669]  This is illegal.
[02:03:30.029 --> 02:03:32.051]  It's a violation of the Posse Comitatus Act.
[02:03:32.512 --> 02:03:34.354]  Whoever signed it for the U.S.
[02:03:34.374 --> 02:03:35.355]  government should go to prison.
[02:03:36.356 --> 02:03:38.358]  Just as the IRS manager should go to prison.
[02:03:39.403 --> 02:03:47.350]  Just as other out-of-control government bureaucrats who in my opinion belonged in Eastern Europe working for the Stasi.
[02:03:47.390 --> 02:03:49.852]  But this is what's emerged under this criminal administration.
[02:03:50.352 --> 02:03:52.734]  I don't have any other words, nor do I have the time to mince words.
[02:03:53.094 --> 02:03:54.375]  Obama is a gangster.
[02:03:55.036 --> 02:03:57.738]  He's running the country like he's a gangster commander.
[02:03:58.178 --> 02:03:59.800]  Not like the president of all the people.
[02:04:01.425 --> 02:04:03.186]  But we the people now have to live a life.
[02:04:03.246 --> 02:04:04.406]  We have to get through our days.
[02:04:04.446 --> 02:04:05.266]  We have to earn a living.
[02:04:05.286 --> 02:04:06.847]  We have to deal with our medical problems.
[02:04:07.207 --> 02:04:08.227]  Our children's issues.
[02:04:08.667 --> 02:04:09.688]  Our parents' issues.
[02:04:10.448 --> 02:04:11.148]  Making a living.
[02:04:11.348 --> 02:04:12.149]  Paying taxes.
[02:04:12.189 --> 02:04:12.769]  Going to work.
[02:04:13.469 --> 02:04:14.950]  And yet there's news out there.
[02:04:14.970 --> 02:04:15.810]  The news is awesome.
[02:04:16.910 --> 02:04:18.691]  I don't like to hear the words, it's a slow news day.
[02:04:18.751 --> 02:04:22.252]  There's never a slow news day in this country under this regime.
[02:04:22.652 --> 02:04:25.293]  You know, good for Michael Savage admitting there's FEMA camps.
[02:04:25.353 --> 02:04:26.814]  Good for him to cover stuff like this.
[02:04:27.214 --> 02:04:28.454]  That's why I like him.
[02:04:28.474 --> 02:04:30.295]  Because none of the others will even touch it.
[02:04:31.838 --> 02:04:34.780]  And a lot of times he gives us credit, too, for our news that he covers on the show.
[02:04:34.800 --> 02:04:35.761]  In fact, the clip's longer.
[02:04:35.781 --> 02:04:36.942]  There's a longer clip he did later.
[02:04:37.442 --> 02:04:41.666]  But the point is, is that this is, for me, this isn't about a radio show.
[02:04:42.286 --> 02:04:43.847]  This is about saving our future.
[02:04:44.207 --> 02:04:49.972]  This is a conscious, coordinated, creeping, authoritarian acclamation that's going on.
[02:04:51.433 --> 02:04:53.875]  There's no choice which side you've got to choose to be on.
[02:04:54.255 --> 02:04:55.936]  And that includes our military and police.
[02:04:55.956 --> 02:04:59.139]  I'm going to explain what's behind this all straight ahead.
[02:05:01.604 --> 02:05:12.751]  Cal Bend Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soap that is triple concentrated and made from the highest quality vegetable and coconut oils.

[02:06:01.929 --> 02:06:04.972]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food and firearms.
[02:06:05.332 --> 02:06:10.798]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.

[02:07:01.736 --> 02:07:04.838]  Oklahoma reminds us there are many kinds of storms in our lives.
[02:07:05.199 --> 02:07:07.821]  Nature regularly sends us destructive storms.
[02:07:08.281 --> 02:07:10.823]  24 hours before a storm strikes, people panic.
[02:07:11.083 --> 02:07:14.325]  It would be wise to prepare ahead of the panic curve.
[02:07:14.525 --> 02:07:20.770]  The food price storm from drought and livestock problems is forecast to hit ridiculous heights by the end of the summer.
[02:07:21.050 --> 02:07:22.712]  Wonder if there'll really be a problem?

[02:08:16.587 --> 02:08:18.788]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:08:19.249 --> 02:08:39.022]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:08:39.162 --> 02:08:39.502]  USA!
[02:08:39.522 --> 02:08:40.002]  USA!
[02:08:40.723 --> 02:08:41.043]  USA!
[02:08:41.063 --> 02:08:41.343]  USA!
[02:08:48.949 --> 02:08:49.089]  Yay!
[02:08:49.209 --> 02:08:49.830]  USA!
[02:08:50.930 --> 02:08:51.291]  USA!
[02:08:51.331 --> 02:09:09.623]  That's what the people chanted, at least what the news cameras showed, as half of Boston, or more, had armored vehicles come in, hundreds of them, and police and military from all over the country aiming guns at children, at women.
[02:09:11.064 --> 02:09:23.887]  In Los Angeles, the police drove around shooting up multiple vehicles with white women driving cars when the mad cop supposedly was driving a truck and wasn't even the same color.
[02:09:26.008 --> 02:09:28.128]  And it happened over and over again, at least three times.
[02:09:29.409 --> 02:09:34.770]  Just a crazed, mad dog psychology, where you get out of your car and
[02:09:35.902 --> 02:09:44.328]  Have your driver's license in your hand, it flashes, so the quickest gun in the West shoots you down, and the police always say, he felt threatened, it's a good kill.
[02:09:45.809 --> 02:09:51.033]  Might start putting on the side of the police guards how many innocent civilians, as you call us, you've killed.
[02:09:51.053 --> 02:10:02.302]  Instead of how many Japanese Zeros you've shot down, maybe how many baby strollers you've run over, maybe how many old ladies you've shot, maybe how many people's dogs you've shot when you're in their backyard.
[02:10:03.385 --> 02:10:06.892]  And again, I know most police are not bad people.
[02:10:07.593 --> 02:10:11.320]  But the system is turning them into paramilitary.
[02:10:12.201 --> 02:10:15.608]  And the feds are funding unconstitutional, it's been thrown out of court.
[02:10:17.748 --> 02:10:21.310]  Checkpoints on our highways, the Army, the Marines are involved.
[02:10:21.710 --> 02:10:30.455]  All of this just goes on, the military drills, until we're so conditioned to it, and it's also in the TV and the movies, to where we accept it.
[02:10:30.755 --> 02:10:33.616]  And then you read the Rand Corporation documents I'm about to go over.
[02:10:34.257 --> 02:10:38.639]  And they admit that this is a long-term strategic plan to prepare us
[02:10:40.043 --> 02:10:48.845]  For the conversion from a once free society with due process and freedom over to a paramilitary third world banana boat republic.
[02:10:50.685 --> 02:10:54.166]  And that's at the heart of why this is happening in our culture.
[02:10:55.086 --> 02:11:01.668]  Yesterday, Paul Watson at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com published an article with press releases by FEMA
[02:11:02.372 --> 02:11:06.514]  That Drudge Report, the number one aggregating news site in the world, linked to.
[02:11:07.334 --> 02:11:13.617]  And so it went all over the web, it was talked about on different talk shows all over the country yesterday.
[02:11:14.657 --> 02:11:17.338]  Should we have Russians in America to keep us safe?
[02:11:18.019 --> 02:11:19.739]  And it's all part of the bizarreness.
[02:11:19.779 --> 02:11:25.242]  The globalists talk about how if they can acclimate us with learned helplessness and kind of
[02:11:26.549 --> 02:11:32.733]  The psychological warfare tenants of mass Stockholm Syndrome, we will basically put up with anything.
[02:11:33.814 --> 02:11:40.377]  And they need to slowly, incrementally titrate the dose of globalist poison to where we'll accept pretty much anything.
[02:11:41.338 --> 02:11:46.741]  It is, normalcy bias is really the best way to describe it.
[02:11:47.402 --> 02:11:48.282]  Incrementally.
[02:11:48.942 --> 02:11:52.825]  Where globally, you notice the police, the military, all basically dress the same now.
[02:11:53.587 --> 02:11:55.508]  NATO troops dress like US troops.
[02:11:55.928 --> 02:11:57.788]  Russian troops dress like NATO troops.
[02:11:58.148 --> 02:12:05.390]  And they all do exchange programs with each other, even though on the surface they claim they're enemies with one another.
[02:12:07.651 --> 02:12:11.032]  Now, if you go back to the newspapers in the 1960s,
[02:12:13.840 --> 02:12:19.522]  You will see the State Department Plan 7277 that we're about to show you on screen of your TV viewer.
[02:12:19.902 --> 02:12:28.184]  For radio listeners, just search the term State Department Memorandum 7277 or link to our article, Russian Forces Provide Security at U.S.
[02:12:28.224 --> 02:12:33.266]  Events, and you'll be able to link through and actually read the PDF of it.
[02:12:34.181 --> 02:12:40.406]  And the accompanying New York Times graphic from the 1960s that showed U.S.
[02:12:40.446 --> 02:12:42.407]  helmets getting smaller, less U.S.
[02:12:42.447 --> 02:12:58.959]  troops, Russian helmets getting smaller, less Russian troops, while the peacekeeping machinery of general and complete disarmament of every nation state except the U.N.
[02:12:59.059 --> 02:13:00.060]  and its army, NATO.
[02:13:01.107 --> 02:13:14.991]  Now fast forward to today, and look at how last year and this year, in three separate hearings that we've covered, the Joint Chiefs of Staff sit there and tell the Congress, you don't control the power of the person of the Constitution anymore.
[02:13:15.391 --> 02:13:17.071]  We get our orders from NATO.
[02:13:17.752 --> 02:13:23.473]  And the President got military authorization for Libya, and now Syria, from NATO.
[02:13:24.773 --> 02:13:26.674]  Now NATO was created by the Bilderberg Group.
[02:13:27.748 --> 02:13:31.692]  NATO was created by the CIA, which again, is a robber baron controlled group.
[02:13:32.073 --> 02:13:35.156]  So let me, in layman's terms, explain what's happening here.
[02:13:36.397 --> 02:13:46.127]  You have the wealth of Europe, the wealth of the West, parlayed by robber barons in around 1900 in a Rockefeller Rothschild meeting.
[02:13:46.848 --> 02:13:48.509]  Meetings they had in London and New York.
[02:13:48.710 --> 02:13:49.551]  These are all on record.
[02:13:50.418 --> 02:13:50.978]  Let's look them up.
[02:13:51.518 --> 02:13:55.439]  For the Cecil Rhodes Group as the front man for the Rothschilds.
[02:13:56.039 --> 02:13:56.860]  This is all on record.
[02:13:56.880 --> 02:13:57.480]  Look this up.
[02:13:57.520 --> 02:13:58.460]  They wrote books about it.
[02:13:59.100 --> 02:14:00.821]  I had guests in last week naming the books.
[02:14:02.141 --> 02:14:11.524]  To establish a corporate global government on the lines of the British East India Company that had run more than 15 nations at one time.
[02:14:12.384 --> 02:14:16.885]  The British found that the British government, if they put up their flag, they couldn't run India.
[02:14:18.410 --> 02:14:20.431]  But if they just called it a corporation, they could.
[02:14:21.752 --> 02:14:37.743]  For hundreds of years, a private Dutch-British-German company, the British-Dutch-East India Company, they merged at one point, ran most of the ships, ran its own military, commanded British military, and would go in and take over all of India.
[02:14:38.766 --> 02:14:44.570]  They only got problems when they got so arrogant as to run the Jolly Roger, I mean the Union Jack.
[02:14:45.251 --> 02:14:47.912]  That's a joke, they call that the real pirate flag worldwide.
[02:14:48.233 --> 02:14:49.654]  That is free people running from it.
[02:14:50.554 --> 02:14:52.756]  They would run that sucker up and people would resist it.
[02:14:53.116 --> 02:14:57.719]  So Rhodes and others, this is why they set up the Council on Foreign Relations in 22 at Proud House, New York.
[02:14:58.160 --> 02:14:59.180]  Read that, that's on record.
[02:15:00.461 --> 02:15:05.485]  Said we're going to have a corporate global government on the lines of the British Empire.
[02:15:06.650 --> 02:15:08.211]  But we're going to get rid of the wealth of England.
[02:15:08.371 --> 02:15:10.532]  Because people look at the wealth of the average Britisher.
[02:15:11.893 --> 02:15:14.234]  Back then, you joined the Empire, you actually got something out of it.
[02:15:14.574 --> 02:15:16.395]  It really did benefit England to a great extent.
[02:15:17.156 --> 02:15:19.977]  Sure, they paid by millions of dead soldiers in the war.
[02:15:20.438 --> 02:15:23.039]  Millions over the hundred years or so of its peak.
[02:15:23.800 --> 02:15:27.141]  They paid in taxes, but they could also get a piece of the booty.
[02:15:27.762 --> 02:15:28.582]  A piece of the loot.
[02:15:30.223 --> 02:15:34.906]  I know the popular meaning of booty means a woman's rear end or derriere, but it means pirate loot.
[02:15:38.150 --> 02:15:42.752]  Continuing, ladies and gentlemen, the problem is, this is such a giant area of history.
[02:15:43.912 --> 02:15:48.194]  It was the British East India Company that took down China with a fake drug war.
[02:15:48.654 --> 02:15:58.598]  They lobbied China to make opium illegal, then they brought in the illegal opium and bought off the police over, again, about a hundred years, and finally broke the country up in ten and then twelve parts.
[02:15:59.099 --> 02:16:01.220]  So you have to understand, there's a global corporate government.
[02:16:01.500 --> 02:16:03.120]  It isn't about to be set up.
[02:16:03.561 --> 02:16:04.381]  It's existed
[02:16:07.489 --> 02:16:09.930]  What, is the British East India Company about 400 years old?
[02:16:09.990 --> 02:16:12.031]  Look up the founding of the British India Company for me.
[02:16:12.211 --> 02:16:13.332]  It's about 400 years old.
[02:16:14.052 --> 02:16:16.253]  The Dutch East India Company is about 400 as well.
[02:16:16.813 --> 02:16:20.835]  The point is, this model, and they even write books about it.
[02:16:20.875 --> 02:16:21.855]  This is not my opinion.
[02:16:22.235 --> 02:16:22.996]  The globalists do.
[02:16:23.276 --> 02:16:24.556]  This is their global government.
[02:16:25.217 --> 02:16:27.217]  The British East India Company didn't pay taxes.
[02:16:28.418 --> 02:16:30.279]  The British East India Company was above the law.
[02:16:31.141 --> 02:16:37.446]  The British East India Company could take private ships, basically, of anybody they wanted, even when there wasn't a war going on.
[02:16:37.946 --> 02:16:40.588]  The British East India Company commanded British warships.
[02:16:40.928 --> 02:16:45.331]  The British East India Company was the guys that invented modern false flagging.
[02:16:47.973 --> 02:16:50.595]  On and on and on, staged terror attacks against their own interest.
[02:16:52.216 --> 02:16:59.001]  And so the model of the British East India Company, if my memory served, it was formed in 1612.
[02:17:01.112 --> 02:17:02.853]  So that'd make it 400 years old exactly.
[02:17:03.413 --> 02:17:04.434]  All right, continuing here.
[02:17:04.894 --> 02:17:06.055]  I don't do that on purpose on air.
[02:17:06.075 --> 02:17:07.176]  I do that to test my own memory.
[02:17:08.276 --> 02:17:09.217]  This is the model.
[02:17:09.237 --> 02:17:11.398]  The New World Order ain't coming, Jack.
[02:17:11.818 --> 02:17:12.879]  The New World Order's here.
[02:17:14.020 --> 02:17:16.561]  It went and grabbed the resources of the world.
[02:17:16.941 --> 02:17:18.042]  It beat the Spanish.
[02:17:18.182 --> 02:17:19.403]  It beat the Portuguese.
[02:17:19.763 --> 02:17:21.064]  It ran out the Germans.
[02:17:21.344 --> 02:17:22.505]  It ran out the French.
[02:17:23.385 --> 02:17:24.466]  It won, okay?
[02:17:25.475 --> 02:17:26.496]  The British Empire.
[02:17:27.236 --> 02:17:28.297]  It ran everybody out.
[02:17:28.517 --> 02:17:31.859]  The Portuguese and Spanish had a lot more than they did just 200 years ago.
[02:17:33.100 --> 02:17:34.821]  Okay, nobody could beat this model.
[02:17:35.602 --> 02:17:36.522]  This is the model.
[02:17:37.823 --> 02:17:40.545]  Using freebooters, using letter of mark, you name it.
[02:17:40.845 --> 02:17:49.251]  And so, when you read about Russian troops training to take on, quote, US extremists in Colorado drills last year,
[02:17:51.204 --> 02:17:57.468]  When you read about Russian troops to be at sporting events, and it's going to be on the news, Russian troops, just to acclimate you.
[02:17:57.869 --> 02:18:02.752]  If you'll put up with the old enemy, the Russkies here, you'll put up with your own cops doing it.
[02:18:03.893 --> 02:18:05.194]  You'll put up with your own military.
[02:18:05.474 --> 02:18:14.740]  It doesn't matter if they're Russkie, it doesn't matter if they're Japanese, it doesn't matter if they're Dutch, it doesn't matter if they're Israeli, it doesn't matter if they're German, French, any of it.
[02:18:14.760 --> 02:18:15.561]  They've all been here.
[02:18:15.941 --> 02:18:17.542]  I've been to the drills, I've videotaped it.
[02:18:19.252 --> 02:18:21.053]  It's all treason against humanity.
[02:18:21.613 --> 02:18:23.814]  Your police have been militarized.
[02:18:24.074 --> 02:18:29.577]  Your police, on record by the RAND Corporation the last 60 years, have been transformed into paramilitary soldiers.
[02:18:30.117 --> 02:18:36.560]  They now admit in the news that police are now running anti-insurgent operations in the U.S.
[02:18:37.160 --> 02:18:38.000]  That's what it is.
[02:18:38.101 --> 02:18:39.501]  You've been labeled the enemy.
[02:18:40.141 --> 02:18:43.283]  So, your wife gets out with a driver's license, looks like a gun, they kill her.
[02:18:44.056 --> 02:18:54.023]  They're training you to go, good job officer, you felt threatened, where they can just kill us whenever they want, pull Alex Jones over, boom, shoot me in the head, say I had a pen in my hand.
[02:18:55.685 --> 02:18:57.506]  They're now executing people publicly.
[02:18:57.706 --> 02:19:01.649]  They're acclimating the cops, the military, the people, everybody.
[02:19:02.830 --> 02:19:07.994]  We're gonna go to break and I'm gonna come back and break all this down no matter how long it takes because, and go over these exhibits here.
[02:19:10.393 --> 02:19:21.718]  But I remember when I first got on air, 18 years ago, getting calls going, I was in Missouri National Park, or State Park, or in Michigan, or in Maryland.
[02:19:21.939 --> 02:19:22.919]  It was always the same story.
[02:19:23.179 --> 02:19:26.421]  And Russian troops came over and searched our bags.
[02:19:27.001 --> 02:19:28.382]  And I thought, these people are insane.
[02:19:28.942 --> 02:19:30.022]  Until I was sent photos.
[02:19:31.383 --> 02:19:33.564]  And then I went, I would get calls.
[02:19:33.624 --> 02:19:35.165]  I said, next time you see this, you call me.
[02:19:35.405 --> 02:19:36.926]  So I'd get on an airplane, I'd go there.
[02:19:38.317 --> 02:19:40.460]  And the government was already listening.
[02:19:40.480 --> 02:19:41.721]  They'd break in our hotel rooms.
[02:19:42.021 --> 02:19:43.423]  They'd sabotage our rent car.
[02:19:43.944 --> 02:19:49.190]  And I would get there and there would be Russian troops and Israelis and everything.
[02:19:49.430 --> 02:19:50.331]  I've got footage of it.
[02:19:52.393 --> 02:19:54.696]  And then they would set fires and try to blame me.
[02:19:54.796 --> 02:19:57.399]  I mean, folks, this is a giant covert op.
[02:19:57.439 --> 02:19:59.041]  I'm going to tell you about it when we come back.
[02:20:01.698 --> 02:20:09.745]  Hi, my name is Annette and due to menopause symptoms for nearly two years, I suffered severe hot flashes which prevented me from sleeping all night.
[02:20:10.045 --> 02:20:14.348]  It was so hard to work because I continued all day to have the hot flashes from hell.
[02:20:14.569 --> 02:20:16.650]  I was exhausted and depleted.
[02:20:16.991 --> 02:20:21.875]  After only three weeks on One World Way, I have no hot flashes and I'm sleeping normally again.
[02:20:22.095 --> 02:20:24.156]  I feel energized and strong.
[02:20:24.617 --> 02:20:25.918]  This is an amazing product.
[02:20:26.078 --> 02:20:32.380]  It is a little known fact that every single cell of your body is supposed to produce 10% of its protein content as glutathione.
[02:20:32.500 --> 02:20:35.201]  But due to toxicity and aging, it does not.
[02:20:35.381 --> 02:20:39.402]  Could glutathione be a missing factor in optimal cell function for your entire body?
[02:20:39.683 --> 02:20:43.944]  If you restore the optimal glutathione levels in your cells, especially your glands and organs,
[02:20:44.144 --> 02:20:44.384]  Thank you.
[02:21:01.540 --> 02:21:02.702]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.

[02:21:13.638 --> 02:21:17.744]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.

[02:21:35.598 --> 02:21:41.282]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[02:21:41.722 --> 02:21:51.229]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[02:21:51.629 --> 02:21:52.810]  The war is here.
[02:21:53.130 --> 02:21:54.531]  It's an info war.
[02:21:55.031 --> 02:21:57.833]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[02:22:01.836 --> 02:22:06.300]  Summer is here, and nothing looks better than tan skin and white teeth.
[02:22:06.780 --> 02:22:09.923]  Hi, I'm Jonathan Greenhut, the CEO of Power Swabs.

[02:22:54.733 --> 02:22:54.874]  Gold.
[02:22:54.914 --> 02:22:56.155]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[02:23:03.220 --> 02:23:09.344]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[02:23:09.504 --> 02:23:13.326]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[02:23:13.686 --> 02:23:15.567]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[02:23:15.607 --> 02:23:17.908]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[02:23:18.049 --> 02:23:25.693]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[02:23:26.133 --> 02:23:26.533]  We're good to go.
[02:23:55.973 --> 02:23:56.913]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[02:24:26.206 --> 02:24:27.307]  Talk about a living legend.
[02:24:31.609 --> 02:24:36.992]  You know, the good news is everybody that knows what's going on needs to speak out now, just like I said last week.
[02:24:37.352 --> 02:24:38.573]  And I guess that's starting to happen.
[02:24:38.933 --> 02:24:44.776]  We better continue to check all our Facebooks and emails and everything, because the kind of messages that are coming in here, guys.
[02:24:47.998 --> 02:24:49.919]  We need all these iconic people.
[02:24:51.578 --> 02:24:56.265]  We've got the right stuff to go public and speak out against the New World Order.
[02:24:56.866 --> 02:24:58.769]  And it needs to be done right now.
[02:24:59.870 --> 02:25:05.318]  Because I'm telling you folks, all the John Birch Society gets is demonized from the 50s and 60s.
[02:25:06.795 --> 02:25:11.917]  Saying there's a plan to bring in foreign troops in America, incrementally getting us used to globalism.
[02:25:12.297 --> 02:25:20.081]  They knew because they had a lot of military officers who weren't traders of this country, who were involved in classified briefings about this plan.
[02:25:20.381 --> 02:25:26.724]  And then in the 60s, they tried to float the plan when they thought America totally trusted the government to put UN troops in America.
[02:25:27.764 --> 02:25:32.206]  That's why you always hear the good old boys going, I see blue helmets, I start shooting.
[02:25:35.171 --> 02:25:37.753]  Because it's a real plan.
[02:25:38.434 --> 02:25:39.615]  And we've held it back.
[02:25:40.056 --> 02:25:42.618]  Zbigniew Brzezinski admits they're at least a decade behind.
[02:25:44.099 --> 02:25:45.380]  But now they're trying to catch up.
[02:25:46.341 --> 02:25:55.330]  Every video game, every sitcom, every movie that's got cops in it, the militias are child molesters, are blowing things up, and George Washington's a pig.
[02:25:55.350 --> 02:25:56.851]  I mean, come on, man!
[02:25:57.171 --> 02:25:58.352]  That's the bad guys!
[02:25:59.417 --> 02:26:03.018]  You'd expect if the Russians would have took over in the 70s, that's what they'd have on TV.
[02:26:03.438 --> 02:26:04.419]  You know, once they took over.
[02:26:04.879 --> 02:26:11.301]  America is bad, founding fathers are bad, your guns are bad, the family is bad, the conservatives are bad.
[02:26:11.321 --> 02:26:14.101]  I mean, on and on and on and on.
[02:26:14.442 --> 02:26:16.942]  Al-Qaeda is not the threat, it is the American people.
[02:26:18.103 --> 02:26:19.003]  It's game over!
[02:26:21.444 --> 02:26:25.385]  So going over these articles, Russian forces to provide security at US events.
[02:26:27.325 --> 02:26:28.146]  Under NLE09,
[02:26:29.955 --> 02:26:30.756]  Via FEMA.
[02:26:31.876 --> 02:26:33.417]  And I'll show you that coming up in the next segment.
[02:26:33.437 --> 02:26:34.758]  Did you guys print NLE09?
[02:26:36.179 --> 02:26:37.060]  FEMA NLE09?
[02:26:37.140 --> 02:26:39.861]  I wanted to... I'll do it during... I'll have a three minute break.
[02:26:39.881 --> 02:26:40.822]  I can get it during the next break.
[02:26:41.182 --> 02:26:46.325]  The point is, Russian forces to provide security at U.S.
[02:26:46.566 --> 02:26:46.946]  events.
[02:26:48.271 --> 02:26:54.652]  And then it goes on to say they're going to have their security here advising the TSA and advising others.
[02:26:54.712 --> 02:26:57.193]  And now they're announcing they're going to start arming the TSA.
[02:26:57.213 --> 02:26:58.353]  They've already armed some.
[02:26:58.713 --> 02:27:00.493]  That article's up on Infowars.com.
[02:27:00.814 --> 02:27:10.575]  All this is is global megabanks that are above the United States and above Russia and above China.
[02:27:10.876 --> 02:27:17.597]  And they make these deals where they control the unlimited trillions of dollars because they got all the governments to accept private
[02:27:18.317 --> 02:27:24.119]  Federal reserves, EU central banks, UK central bank, Russian central bank.
[02:27:24.359 --> 02:27:36.683]  There's less than maybe 15 or so countries, most of them backwaters, that don't have a globalist-run central bank where $1 that you deposit can be loaned out as $10.
[02:27:38.183 --> 02:27:41.544]  Well, that gives those megabanks the power to take over the world.
[02:27:41.604 --> 02:27:42.444]  They have that power.
[02:27:43.025 --> 02:27:49.527]  Now, they get trillions at zero percent interest, and then loan it out to us at 10, 20, 30 percent, or 40.
[02:27:50.727 --> 02:27:55.169]  Or, in some cases, they just get trillions, hundreds of billions per company, and straight bailouts.
[02:27:55.409 --> 02:27:56.589]  They get the corporate welfare.
[02:27:56.789 --> 02:27:58.790]  They get the NSA spy grid to spy on people.
[02:28:00.351 --> 02:28:04.272]  And so, it's not just Russians here, it's Americans over there.
[02:28:06.133 --> 02:28:06.673]  And it's...
[02:28:08.106 --> 02:28:11.728]  Latin American troops practicing landing in Florida, and it's U.S.
[02:28:11.748 --> 02:28:14.429]  troops practicing landing in the Latin American countries.
[02:28:14.969 --> 02:28:28.116]  And in NLE09, 15 troop groups and security forces from 15 listed nations on FEMA's website, here to quote, train to take on domestic
[02:28:30.416 --> 02:28:30.956]  Extremist.
[02:28:31.717 --> 02:28:32.557]  So that's what it is.
[02:28:32.978 --> 02:28:34.418]  The globalists set up a world government.
[02:28:34.438 --> 02:28:36.219]  They start all these global forms of taxes.
[02:28:36.239 --> 02:28:39.101]  That's what these direct bailouts of the banks are and bail-ins.
[02:28:39.561 --> 02:28:42.443]  They go and grab money out of your private bank account, send it to private individuals.
[02:28:42.763 --> 02:28:44.164]  Who's getting it's even secret.
[02:28:44.524 --> 02:28:52.509]  And then there's just NATO forces just land or are invited in by your country as what they call a stabilization force.
[02:28:53.069 --> 02:28:54.572]  We're going to go to break in a long segment.
[02:28:54.832 --> 02:28:56.956]  I'm going to show you all these documents of your TV viewer.
[02:28:57.236 --> 02:29:00.462]  Radio listeners can just write down what I'm saying and look it up for themselves.
[02:29:03.744 --> 02:29:11.311]  And again, the globalists control the media, the dominant media, so they implode the countries, pose as the saviors, and then are invited in.
[02:29:11.331 --> 02:29:25.124]  EU Stabilization Force brought into Greece, EU Stabilization Force brought into Spain, EU Stabilization Forces, UN Stabilization Forces brought into Latin America to help carry out the environmental law, exterminating people.
[02:29:25.384 --> 02:29:27.125]  We're on the march.
[02:29:27.206 --> 02:29:28.627]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.739 --> 02:29:57.522]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.426 --> 02:30:05.709]  There is an increased need to support our immunity and health.
[02:30:06.730 --> 02:30:12.636]  At Silverlungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of silver-based products.
[02:30:13.737 --> 02:30:18.281]  Our most popular silver-based products are the 32-ounce nano-silver solutions.
[02:30:19.548 --> 02:30:20.268]  Our 2 oz.
[02:30:20.349 --> 02:30:24.531]  nano silver nasal applicators, as well as our all-natural silver soaps.
[02:30:25.671 --> 02:30:28.973]  Just released is our 100% natural silver gel.
[02:30:29.934 --> 02:30:36.157]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.
[02:30:37.218 --> 02:30:48.144]  But rather, we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera, to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin, while delivering the silver more effectively.
[02:30:49.170 --> 02:30:54.654]  Are we choosing our own destiny, or has it been pre-selected for us?
[02:30:54.714 --> 02:31:02.500]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[02:31:02.540 --> 02:31:04.021]  Billions of dollars have been spent
[02:31:13.047 --> 02:31:18.308]  Privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[02:31:18.488 --> 02:31:27.710]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[02:31:27.810 --> 02:31:34.771]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[02:31:34.991 --> 02:31:37.852]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[02:31:38.052 --> 02:31:44.836]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse, but demand a war.
[02:31:45.096 --> 02:31:46.397]  Oh, there's another one!
[02:31:46.417 --> 02:31:47.638]  Another plane just hit!
[02:31:47.678 --> 02:31:48.498]  State of Mind.
[02:31:48.758 --> 02:31:50.179]  Because there's a war on.
[02:31:50.399 --> 02:31:51.099]  Or your mind.
[02:31:51.340 --> 02:31:55.382]  Get your copy of State of Mind the movie at InfoWars.com.
[02:31:55.542 --> 02:32:00.605]  And remember, every order at InfoWarsStore.com receives a free citizen rulebook.
[02:32:01.548 --> 02:32:11.391]  Now is the perfect time to spring clean your body with Supernatural Silver, a non-toxic disinfectant for the body that can be used internally or externally.

[02:33:04.928 --> 02:33:06.449]  We are on the march.
[02:33:06.789 --> 02:33:09.270]  The Empire is on the run.
[02:33:09.970 --> 02:33:13.652]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:27.887 --> 02:33:33.368]  I'm looking for a few good men and women of every race, color, creed, religion who want basic freedom.
[02:33:34.388 --> 02:33:40.730]  You want a Bill of Rights, a Constitution, you want to be able to stand on your own two feet and be treated like a human being, then you want freedom.
[02:33:41.510 --> 02:33:46.631]  You want to be a slave, then sign up with the New World Order because I've studied history, I've studied current regimes.
[02:33:47.011 --> 02:33:50.172]  There ain't nothing, and I mean there ain't nothing.
[02:33:51.992 --> 02:33:53.413]  Worse than the New World Order.
[02:33:54.213 --> 02:34:01.096]  Nothing nastier, nothing smarter, nothing more vicious, more murderous, more committed than the Globalist.
[02:34:02.817 --> 02:34:10.861]  And if the general public could just wrap their brains around this, why do you think they're in the news now saying Russian troops are going to be in America?
[02:34:13.102 --> 02:34:15.123]  They always did these drills before.
[02:34:15.143 --> 02:34:20.586]  And then if we tried to cover it, even had video,
[02:34:21.428 --> 02:34:24.350]  They'd have their talking heads and bots come out and say we were crazy.
[02:34:25.591 --> 02:34:29.154]  They call them their megaphones, their sock puppets, fake online profiles.
[02:34:30.516 --> 02:34:35.340]  They'll have them in this post, we put this on YouTube later tomorrow, you know, saying none of this exists.
[02:34:36.040 --> 02:34:37.061]  Or that it's no big deal.
[02:34:38.102 --> 02:34:41.965]  Because they're there to just acclimate you, where okay, yeah, they have Russian troops.
[02:34:42.966 --> 02:34:47.290]  See, first it's TSA in the airport, then they're on the street, then they're at the football game.
[02:34:48.379 --> 02:34:51.200]  And then now it's TSA everywhere and all over the country.
[02:34:51.440 --> 02:34:53.361]  You film police, they walk over and go, why are you filming me?
[02:34:53.801 --> 02:34:55.082]  I'm just documenting what you're doing.
[02:34:56.982 --> 02:35:03.365]  Put your hands behind your back, they put you in handcuffs, slam your head in the concrete, your dog jumps out of the car, they shoot it.
[02:35:04.965 --> 02:35:07.326]  It's because you are an enemy soldier.
[02:35:08.427 --> 02:35:14.609]  And basic military training is, an enemy soldier gives you a lip, kick him in the head.
[02:35:17.062 --> 02:35:19.643]  Cover up murders, cover up corruption.
[02:35:19.803 --> 02:35:20.963]  We are called civilians.
[02:35:21.283 --> 02:35:22.984]  Your mayors call you civilians.
[02:35:23.364 --> 02:35:24.904]  Your police chiefs call you civilians.
[02:35:25.145 --> 02:35:27.165]  They're civilians too, but not really.
[02:35:27.185 --> 02:35:28.686]  They'll tell you, we're a paramilitary force.
[02:35:29.066 --> 02:35:32.267]  You are civilians because we are under a military occupation.
[02:35:32.527 --> 02:35:34.787]  Now the good news is, this is waking up the police.
[02:35:35.788 --> 02:35:37.148]  This is an incredible takeover.
[02:35:37.188 --> 02:35:39.409]  So a lot of police are going, yeah this is going on.
[02:35:39.929 --> 02:35:42.610]  And a lot of military especially, they're really waking up.
[02:35:44.198 --> 02:35:49.491]  So it's our job to reach out to police and military because the globalists plan to have the police abuse us?
[02:35:50.779 --> 02:36:01.126]  To then make us get angry and make us act as a hostile force to play into that psychology instead of going over to these guys and going, do you understand what's happening?
[02:36:01.686 --> 02:36:02.607]  Do you want the big picture?
[02:36:02.967 --> 02:36:06.889]  And you pull back with police and military and show them like I'm doing right now?
[02:36:07.350 --> 02:36:15.495]  There's a reason half the military, it was 40% just six months ago, half the military I walk up to and then I talk to them are listeners.
[02:36:15.995 --> 02:36:18.056]  And then they'll tell me either 90% of their unit or 30%.
[02:36:21.032 --> 02:36:25.794]  But it's always about half, are awake and know what's going on and are upset and listen to the show.
[02:36:26.094 --> 02:36:26.274]  Why?
[02:36:26.314 --> 02:36:28.215]  Because I talk about things they know are true.
[02:36:29.455 --> 02:36:32.296]  I talk about things that they've been part of and didn't understand.
[02:36:32.676 --> 02:36:36.178]  They know when they hear this show, I know what I'm talking about!
[02:36:37.538 --> 02:36:44.361]  Because I am a veteran of defending the Republic for 18 years on air, 20, it'll be 21 years in a few months.
[02:36:45.233 --> 02:36:47.795]  Folks, I used to hear about there were black helicopters in our town.
[02:36:48.035 --> 02:36:52.258]  They blew up the old police station and threatened to kill us if we talked about it.
[02:36:52.518 --> 02:36:56.181]  And I'd go down there, there'd be a burnout building and cops asking, you're not supposed to ask questions.
[02:36:56.681 --> 02:36:58.182]  I'm like, you mean this is real?
[02:37:00.384 --> 02:37:04.166]  I'd be told, oh yeah, they got foreign troops, they're gonna practice rounding people up in the town.
[02:37:04.527 --> 02:37:06.448]  So I'd go to the events, I'd shoot video of it.
[02:37:07.929 --> 02:37:12.092]  And have Marines walk over with machine guns and say, turn your camera off.
[02:37:13.618 --> 02:37:21.146]  I've witnessed them with troops from seven different nations in Oakland, trained for gun confiscation, and admit it was for America.
[02:37:21.366 --> 02:37:22.026]  On video!
[02:37:22.267 --> 02:37:22.847]  Police State 2000!
[02:37:23.648 --> 02:37:24.929]  Police State 2, the takeover!
[02:37:25.110 --> 02:37:26.971]  Police State 3, total enslavement!
[02:37:27.172 --> 02:37:28.793]  Police State 4, the rise of FEMA!
[02:37:28.813 --> 02:37:31.936]  I mean, you think this is all just an exercise in baloney?
[02:37:32.137 --> 02:37:33.158]  We have the video!
[02:37:37.209 --> 02:37:42.613]  Then I was told they were going to have foreign trips, but really it turned out it was probably drug smuggling, the way they acted.
[02:37:42.913 --> 02:37:44.474]  I get to Brooksville, Florida.
[02:37:46.336 --> 02:37:49.318]  I gotta get Mike Hanson back in here, a guy, Raymond Digg, he's worked me for two years.
[02:37:49.698 --> 02:37:51.239]  He worked off and on as a volunteer before that.
[02:37:51.900 --> 02:37:56.043]  And in between, a better engineering job, and they had a bunch of layoffs, he worked for me.
[02:37:56.423 --> 02:37:57.163]  Really smart guy.
[02:37:57.183 --> 02:38:06.310]  I need to get Mike Hanson in here, who was with me in Florida, in the woods, trying to cover military drills.
[02:38:08.729 --> 02:38:14.493]  When they had a guy jump out of the bushes that was where they set fires, I had to start putting out and then had to jump on the guy to stop him.
[02:38:16.335 --> 02:38:20.798]  I mean, they were going to burn down Brooksville, Florida, and blame it on me.
[02:38:24.021 --> 02:38:29.065]  The day before they got there, we got footage of this, I'm walking down the street, people come up and go, you're Alex Jones?
[02:38:29.485 --> 02:38:30.426]  This is a good-sized town.
[02:38:30.946 --> 02:38:32.788]  We're not supposed to talk to you.
[02:38:33.168 --> 02:38:34.589]  The Army came to our door.
[02:38:35.910 --> 02:38:38.232]  And I later learned when Marines visited me,
[02:38:40.121 --> 02:38:54.865]  Popped in the VHS tape that was a screen capture, I guess, off of the digital of myself a year before at Operation Urban Warrior in Oakland, California, and they had a drone over me called Death Star.
[02:38:54.905 --> 02:38:55.805]  That was its codename.
[02:38:56.545 --> 02:39:02.346]  And they had drones using us, gassing our car up, leaving the hotel, going to cover it.
[02:39:02.606 --> 02:39:04.507]  They used us as part of the simulation.
[02:39:06.087 --> 02:39:11.710]  When you go protest one of these things or you go cover it, it's a simulation when they break in your hotel room.
[02:39:12.891 --> 02:39:18.314]  It's a simulation when they set a fire and say, why are you setting a fire as they light the grass on fire?
[02:39:18.334 --> 02:39:22.337]  I mean, this is so sick.
[02:39:24.518 --> 02:39:25.439]  This is so sick.
[02:39:26.584 --> 02:39:28.365]  And of course, these Marines weren't supposed to be showing me this.
[02:39:28.385 --> 02:39:29.365]  They weren't there to threaten me either.
[02:39:29.545 --> 02:39:31.166]  They said, hey, we all got upset about this too.
[02:39:31.446 --> 02:39:35.248]  And they showed it to me, because they knew some family I knew that I'm going to leave it at that.
[02:39:35.608 --> 02:39:36.269]  And I said, let me show this.
[02:39:36.289 --> 02:39:36.829]  And they said, nope.
[02:39:36.909 --> 02:39:37.890]  Are you kidding?
[02:39:38.230 --> 02:39:39.330]  We'd get arrested for this.
[02:39:39.390 --> 02:39:40.731]  And they said goodbye and left.
[02:39:41.311 --> 02:39:42.532]  And Mike Hanson was sitting there going.
[02:39:44.616 --> 02:39:47.197]  And they're like, Death Star, Death Star, we're over the targets.
[02:39:47.257 --> 02:39:52.398]  I mean, they had drones on me in 1999.
[02:39:52.678 --> 02:39:54.418]  I'm just Alex Jones, man.
[02:39:54.598 --> 02:39:55.898]  They're trying to take my guns.
[02:39:56.139 --> 02:39:57.019]  I want to show you.
[02:39:57.359 --> 02:40:00.479]  But they can't let me show you that because you might wake up.
[02:40:01.380 --> 02:40:02.980]  Now they got Russians here.
[02:40:03.160 --> 02:40:07.081]  Folks, they've had Russians here for 20 stinking years that I know of.
[02:40:10.353 --> 02:40:22.938]  I remember getting calls from England going, they've got foreign troops, including Russians, in Scotland searching our houses, and I didn't believe it, and then it came out in the BBC a year later, because the people basically rioted.
[02:40:23.998 --> 02:40:32.682]  They had Russian and Ukrainian troops, they're supposedly old enemies, ransacking people's vehicles at highway checkpoints in Scotland.
[02:40:32.962 --> 02:40:33.542]  Look it up!
[02:40:34.983 --> 02:40:38.084]  As a psych warfare test to see what they would do.
[02:40:39.272 --> 02:40:49.459]  I can't tell you folks how many people are in some remote area of the woods and foreign troops come over and in some cases they kill Americans just to see if they can get away with it.
[02:40:54.622 --> 02:41:05.129]  And so that's what I'm getting at here is that they're now telling you about the Russians in anti-extremist training last year and earlier this year in Colorado.
[02:41:06.837 --> 02:41:08.678]  You know, first it's, oh, they're inspecting our missiles.
[02:41:09.178 --> 02:41:10.758]  And then they're inspecting our helicopters.
[02:41:11.078 --> 02:41:14.799]  And then, oh, they're inspecting our national security system.
[02:41:14.839 --> 02:41:18.641]  And then they're doing... And I'm not saying the Russians are the enemy.
[02:41:19.061 --> 02:41:20.221]  The globalists have all the money.
[02:41:20.261 --> 02:41:21.401]  They're above all the countries.
[02:41:21.602 --> 02:41:23.682]  They've got their operatives in almost everywhere.
[02:41:24.002 --> 02:41:30.524]  And they order the ministries to do these things and do exchange programs to where we'll put up with anything.
[02:41:32.025 --> 02:41:35.826]  Just like last year, or no, it was two years ago now, the Winter Olympics.
[02:41:37.273 --> 02:41:48.036]  In Canada, it was in all their papers that, oh look, the Yanks are here helping run checkpoints and run security in the towns outside the Olympics.
[02:41:49.256 --> 02:41:51.516]  Because Canadians have always been wary of a U.S.
[02:41:51.536 --> 02:41:51.977]  takeover.
[02:41:52.437 --> 02:41:59.418]  So if they'll put up with Americans doing it, and vice versa folks, this is all public is what's so frustrating.
[02:41:59.738 --> 02:42:01.359]  Now let's go over some of these news articles here.
[02:42:02.139 --> 02:42:05.940]  Russia forces, Russian forces to provide security
[02:42:07.362 --> 02:42:07.802]  At U.S.
[02:42:07.862 --> 02:42:17.827]  events, FEMA signs a deal with the Russian Emergency Situations Ministry to exchange experts to oversee security events like football games, baseball games, city events.
[02:42:18.127 --> 02:42:25.491]  That's why I can't go to any major city event now, open air, and not have regular Army, National Guard, State Guard there searching people.
[02:42:27.881 --> 02:42:35.288]  I can't go on Lake Austin without watching every boat be pulled over and every kayaker pulled over and harassed.
[02:42:35.508 --> 02:42:38.050]  But I got up and stood there with the same body language.
[02:42:38.270 --> 02:42:45.217]  I mean, these cops yesterday were just, were just like, just like, like if I was trying to intimidate somebody or like if I was about to get in a fight with somebody, I'd act like this.
[02:42:45.697 --> 02:42:49.060]  I mean, just like when you're just bugging their eyes out at you.
[02:42:49.080 --> 02:42:51.943]  So when they pulled up behind us, I just stood up, started filming them.
[02:42:52.083 --> 02:42:54.185]  I couldn't wait to educate them.
[02:42:56.015 --> 02:43:00.116]  I couldn't wait, because they won't listen now, but when they're dying of cancer in five years they will.
[02:43:00.136 --> 02:43:16.580]  I was talking about the vaccines and things and how pathetic, and you know, how in this system, how am I automatically a suspect when they have no evidence to pull us over, everything, you know, blah blah blah, how this is a violation of the Fourth Amendment, how I know they've been told that waterways are a privilege, they're not, Supreme Court rulings.
[02:43:16.920 --> 02:43:18.021]  I was going to educate them.
[02:43:18.201 --> 02:43:23.122]  Well, why when I was a kid did you not stick your chest out and pull over every boat and bug your eyes out?
[02:43:23.382 --> 02:43:36.066]  The truth is you've been given paramilitary training like this is a Fallujah checkpoint and that you're in deadly danger of me when the truth is I'm in danger of you and a tyrannical government and that's George Washington talking there, buddy!
[02:43:39.747 --> 02:43:42.988]  The truth is, are we going to celebrate on the 4th of July this tyranny?
[02:43:43.629 --> 02:43:44.629]  I'm not going to celebrate it.
[02:43:45.831 --> 02:43:46.811]  How about we mourn?
[02:43:47.131 --> 02:43:48.092]  How about we cry?
[02:43:48.112 --> 02:43:52.373]  How about we go to the back of a church for six hours and meditate on what we've become?
[02:43:52.393 --> 02:44:01.336]  Instead of going out and, you know, going through some checkpoints and celebrating some fireworks they're trying to ban for the citizens to have because we can't be trusted to have them.
[02:44:04.457 --> 02:44:08.878]  This is a global corporate total takeover where they're acclimating everyone.
[02:44:09.098 --> 02:44:11.039]  Give all our deepwater ports in the Pacific
[02:44:12.145 --> 02:44:14.207]  And in the Atlantic to the Communist Chinese.
[02:44:14.627 --> 02:44:16.708]  Give them the Panama Canal.
[02:44:17.829 --> 02:44:21.212]  Let Chinese Communist front companies have 6,000 companies in the U.S.
[02:44:21.512 --> 02:44:25.135]  Pay $21 million of tax money to move the major new plants.
[02:44:25.215 --> 02:44:27.096]  They didn't just build them there.
[02:44:27.576 --> 02:44:29.718]  You paid to move them there!
[02:44:31.239 --> 02:44:33.941]  Militarily, they're shutting off all our major power plants.
[02:44:34.481 --> 02:44:35.362]  Shipping our jobs.
[02:44:35.442 --> 02:44:36.283]  Paying to ship them.
[02:44:37.130 --> 02:44:40.514]  China's like, we can't take your General Motors plants, we'll pay you.
[02:44:40.534 --> 02:44:43.597]  21 billion, the cost of all the plants and the workers for five years.
[02:44:44.418 --> 02:44:46.341]  And we can then sell those to America.
[02:44:46.981 --> 02:44:47.862]  You bet your boots.
[02:44:48.363 --> 02:44:50.706]  We haven't got the robots ready, we want your slaves.
[02:44:51.126 --> 02:44:53.469]  Because they can leverage out all their factories in America.
[02:44:58.524 --> 02:44:59.785]  You studied military warfare?
[02:45:00.265 --> 02:45:05.087]  You blow up their infrastructure, you blow up their manufacturing, you blow up their power plants, you bomb them.
[02:45:05.447 --> 02:45:06.988]  Our government is doing that right now.
[02:45:07.048 --> 02:45:08.749]  It's bombing everything politically.
[02:45:09.329 --> 02:45:12.531]  Everything's being ripped out, shoved into the ocean.
[02:45:15.452 --> 02:45:19.214]  Obama's telling people, it's not good to have a nice house or a nice car, that hurts the earth.
[02:45:19.474 --> 02:45:21.435]  Getting you ready to think it's sexy to be poor.
[02:45:25.074 --> 02:45:27.517]  This is a radical transformation we're now entering.
[02:45:27.537 --> 02:45:28.598]  Let me go over more of these articles.
[02:45:28.618 --> 02:45:29.719]  Let me show you what this really is.
[02:45:29.959 --> 02:45:33.643]  Here's State Department Memorandum 7277, Public Law.
[02:45:34.424 --> 02:45:35.165]  Freedom from War.
[02:45:36.226 --> 02:45:36.886]  How the U.S.
[02:45:36.906 --> 02:45:39.529]  will incrementally lose its entire military along with the Russians.
[02:45:40.731 --> 02:45:42.673]  The exchange programs, everything.
[02:45:42.833 --> 02:45:44.014]  And I've got the full binder.
[02:45:44.054 --> 02:45:45.335]  It's that thick going over all this.
[02:45:45.395 --> 02:45:46.637]  I've shown it to you before here on air.
[02:45:48.680 --> 02:45:59.745]  And then you find in the news articles, oh, Russian police come over to learn how to American policing, and our police are sent to them, back and forth, to where everybody's comfortable with having foreign troops here.
[02:45:59.765 --> 02:46:05.988]  Because if you'll put up with that, you'll surely put up with your own so-called police setting up a checkpoint, when it's all illegal.
[02:46:07.406 --> 02:46:13.152]  Supreme Court rules they can't set up checkpoints to see who exit the highway and then use that as Fourth Amendment to search your car.
[02:46:13.432 --> 02:46:17.276]  So they call them April Fool's jokes and go, there was no checkpoint up ahead.
[02:46:17.616 --> 02:46:22.141]  Or they have you drop a checkpoint and say, we're here to take blood and most people just give the blood.
[02:46:25.689 --> 02:46:27.250]  State Department Memorandum 7277.
[02:46:28.491 --> 02:46:31.353]  Let's put up the helmet graphic on TV for folks.
[02:46:31.634 --> 02:46:32.174]  Go read this.
[02:46:32.214 --> 02:46:33.035]  This has been the plan.
[02:46:33.335 --> 02:46:37.578]  This is why everybody warns you about this.
[02:46:37.919 --> 02:46:39.160]  Why is there freedom from war?
[02:46:39.480 --> 02:46:40.601]  Because only the
[02:46:41.181 --> 02:46:41.621]  U.N.
[02:46:41.781 --> 02:46:43.162]  is going to have the weapons.
[02:46:43.442 --> 02:46:44.203]  And who set it up?
[02:46:44.283 --> 02:46:45.184]  Private corporations.
[02:46:45.424 --> 02:46:46.384]  And then again, the U.N.
[02:46:46.444 --> 02:46:55.810]  is above the law, with diplomatic immunity, run by the big billionaires that control trillions, who are exempt from taxes, and above the law, with diplomatic immunity.
[02:46:56.070 --> 02:46:57.551]  Google has diplomatic immunity.
[02:46:57.871 --> 02:46:59.532]  Goldman Sachs has diplomatic immunity.
[02:46:59.852 --> 02:47:01.333]  British Petroleum has diplomatic immunity.
[02:47:01.553 --> 02:47:03.495]  And they fund the Bilderberg Group, on record.
[02:47:04.455 --> 02:47:07.217]  They're allowed to steal all your data, because they are the NSA.
[02:47:08.387 --> 02:47:12.070]  But they've got a new movie out called Interns, where they're friendly.
[02:47:12.751 --> 02:47:14.333]  That's military propaganda.
[02:47:15.133 --> 02:47:21.579]  We're working on a story where hundreds of millions are being given to directors, covertly, for huge propaganda purposes.
[02:47:23.061 --> 02:47:28.966]  I mean, folks, if you knew the things we knew that I'm not even ready to break to you yet, it is a full-on takeover.
[02:47:29.507 --> 02:47:32.149]  It is by the grace of God I'm even alive right now.
[02:47:32.810 --> 02:47:33.070]  Okay?
[02:47:33.090 --> 02:47:33.591]  Pray for us.
[02:47:34.815 --> 02:47:36.356]  Spread the word about this broadcast.
[02:47:36.796 --> 02:47:38.056]  Let me show you the really key document.
[02:47:38.096 --> 02:47:38.737]  Let's go to the next one.
[02:47:39.557 --> 02:47:40.537]  Arroyo Center.
[02:47:41.718 --> 02:47:42.978]  Rand Corporation.
[02:47:45.960 --> 02:47:50.101]  This is the Stability Police Force for the United States.
[02:47:50.441 --> 02:47:52.762]  It describes UN occupation forces.
[02:47:53.122 --> 02:47:54.843]  This is 200 plus pages long.
[02:47:55.183 --> 02:47:56.364]  I suggest you go read it.
[02:47:59.305 --> 02:48:04.287]  They are advised by the former head
[02:48:05.638 --> 02:48:10.320]  of National Security for the Pentagon, General Jones, and all these other top names.
[02:48:10.440 --> 02:48:10.680]  Read it.
[02:48:12.181 --> 02:48:13.221]  And I read similar documents.
[02:48:13.241 --> 02:48:18.824]  This is just an update of what's been around since the late 1990s when I first read all this, and that's why I knew everything, because it was just admitted.
[02:48:19.284 --> 02:48:21.905]  Justification and options for creating U.S.
[02:48:21.925 --> 02:48:24.206]  capabilities for a stability police force.
[02:48:24.546 --> 02:48:25.367]  This is 7277.
[02:48:26.207 --> 02:48:31.589]  This is the Freedom for War, multinational, corporate U.S.
[02:48:31.670 --> 02:48:32.390]  Army Corps,
[02:48:33.524 --> 02:48:34.464]  That's at the center of it.
[02:48:34.964 --> 02:48:37.045]  Stability International Force.
[02:48:37.105 --> 02:48:39.306]  And it says, modeled after the U.N.
[02:48:39.386 --> 02:48:47.048]  occupations, and it lists Serbia, Herzegovina, it lists areas of Africa, it lists the Middle East, it lists this.
[02:48:47.308 --> 02:48:47.988]  Right now, U.S.
[02:48:48.048 --> 02:48:53.070]  troops, this plan's going into full bore, have been sent to northern Israel and southern Israel.
[02:48:54.491 --> 02:48:54.711]  U.S.
[02:48:54.751 --> 02:48:57.472]  troops have now landed in Jordan and are refusing to leave.
[02:48:57.752 --> 02:48:58.912]  And it's not even in our news.
[02:48:59.192 --> 02:48:59.792]  It's in Reuters.
[02:49:00.452 --> 02:49:01.072]  So-called U.S.
[02:49:01.112 --> 02:49:01.452]  forces.
[02:49:01.472 --> 02:49:01.832]  They're not.
[02:49:02.112 --> 02:49:03.373]  This is under NATO orders.
[02:49:04.173 --> 02:49:04.613]  And U.N.
[02:49:04.693 --> 02:49:04.953]  orders.
[02:49:06.313 --> 02:49:08.234]  This is the world government force.
[02:49:08.554 --> 02:49:09.774]  You'll still have the military.
[02:49:09.974 --> 02:49:11.374]  You'll still have an American patch.
[02:49:11.614 --> 02:49:13.214]  But you'll be under U.N.
[02:49:13.294 --> 02:49:13.755]  command.
[02:49:14.755 --> 02:49:15.455]  That's the plan!
[02:49:15.775 --> 02:49:16.135]  Boom!
[02:49:16.515 --> 02:49:17.095]  Bada-bing!
[02:49:17.595 --> 02:49:17.995]  It's done.
[02:49:18.235 --> 02:49:20.896]  Go read the Stability Police Force United States.
[02:49:20.916 --> 02:49:21.276]  Go read it!
[02:49:22.898 --> 02:49:24.741]  We just printed out the summary today around the office.
[02:49:24.761 --> 02:49:27.465]  We printed the whole 200 plus page baby about a month ago on air.
[02:49:27.485 --> 02:49:34.535]  I went through it and it describes off the UN military occupation of a country model how to do that for the US.
[02:49:35.549 --> 02:49:56.746]  And again, they've been saying since the 90s, we're going to collapse the U.S., we're going to federalize the police, here's how they'll be federalized, we're going to set the threat fusion centers, we're going to make it spree decor, where only the elite police are part of the special events team, then we'll expand that where all the other cops want to be part of it, they'll be given a supplemental federal paycheck, then that will be swung under U.N.
[02:49:57.006 --> 02:49:58.087]  control via FEMA.
[02:49:58.567 --> 02:50:05.970]  And now FEMA says we're under the UN with the Russians, and the Russians are coming here to run security at events.
[02:50:06.230 --> 02:50:08.331]  And they're going to have Russians on the news.
[02:50:08.571 --> 02:50:11.272]  Well, I guess I'm glad the Russians are here to search my bag.
[02:50:12.092 --> 02:50:12.412]  Why not?
[02:50:12.452 --> 02:50:13.993]  You'd let them stick their hands down your pants.
[02:50:14.713 --> 02:50:17.275]  You'd let them take your five-year-old away and stick their hands down their pants?
[02:50:17.555 --> 02:50:18.976]  Why wouldn't they hurt you?
[02:50:19.416 --> 02:50:26.360]  I'd listen to the childlike, pathetic weakness of the average American who calls into other talk radio shows, not my listeners on average.
[02:50:26.860 --> 02:50:33.845]  I'd watch them, who are just into loving the government and trusting the state and, oh, I take all my shots, I love the system.
[02:50:34.145 --> 02:50:37.247]  You are the biggest idiots the world's ever seen.
[02:50:37.947 --> 02:50:40.749]  This is a on-record, total takeover.
[02:50:41.854 --> 02:50:47.898]  And let me tell you, they're getting close to blowing stuff up and blaming it on us and having the whole insurrection and the whole nine yards if they're already rolling out the Russians.
[02:50:48.098 --> 02:50:49.239]  They've been here for 20 years.
[02:50:49.719 --> 02:50:51.060]  Now they're getting you ready for them.
[02:50:51.400 --> 02:50:54.542]  That means they're getting very close to dropping the hammer, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:50:55.363 --> 02:50:57.684]  So now we're right again about foreign troops.
[02:50:58.665 --> 02:51:00.106]  I've got more documents straight ahead.
[02:51:01.957 --> 02:51:05.078]  Oklahoma reminds us there are many kinds of storms in our lives.
[02:51:05.419 --> 02:51:08.020]  Nature regularly sends us destructive storms.
[02:51:08.040 --> 02:51:11.041]  24 hours before a storm strikes, people panic.
[02:51:11.321 --> 02:51:14.543]  It would be wise to prepare ahead of the panic curve.
[02:51:14.743 --> 02:51:21.026]  The food price storm from drought and livestock problems is forecast to hit ridiculous heights by the end of the summer.
[02:51:21.306 --> 02:51:22.946]  Wonder if there'll really be a problem?
[02:51:23.367 --> 02:51:26.148]  eFoods Direct has a plan to maximize your food dollar

[02:51:58.211 --> 02:52:05.497]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[02:52:06.158 --> 02:52:09.100]  I want you to know some very important information.
[02:52:09.200 --> 02:52:17.508]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[02:52:18.138 --> 02:52:23.079]  Now, 27 years later, carnivore capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[02:52:23.699 --> 02:52:34.661]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.
[02:52:35.061 --> 02:52:42.063]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.

[02:53:00.754 --> 02:53:05.258]  We all know the terrible damage that viruses and bacteria can inflict in the human body.
[02:53:05.558 --> 02:53:14.926]  Dozens of diseases are caused by infectious organisms, and now the emergence of superbugs that are resistant to antibiotics poses an even bigger threat to our safety.
[02:53:15.446 --> 02:53:19.449]  Don't wait for the medical world to discover a new treatment for the latest superbug.
[02:53:19.850 --> 02:53:24.614]  It's important to realize that a simple, safe, and effective alternative already exists.

[02:54:09.179 --> 02:54:12.443]  Alex Jones here back live on this Tuesday edition.
[02:54:15.887 --> 02:54:23.397]  Look, what's going on here is acclimation, is conditioning, is incrementalism.
[02:54:25.285 --> 02:54:49.344]  And the globalists are masters at just slowly bringing in things, slowly turning the heat up, until you're like, oh yeah, everybody's heard about the Russian troops, everybody's heard about the TSA checkpoints on the highways, everybody's heard, everybody's had the cops pull up to each boat on the lake and bug their eyes out and act rude, and we all cower, and the cops all see that and think, well that's how you act towards people, you little scum!
[02:54:50.265 --> 02:54:54.808]  This is all so they can take our bank accounts, shut our industry down, break us financially.
[02:54:55.088 --> 02:54:59.512]  This is a military, foreign, corporate, British East India Company style takeover.
[02:55:00.332 --> 02:55:01.553]  We're under total siege.
[02:55:02.113 --> 02:55:04.835]  And the cops, they're under attack, the military's under attack.
[02:55:05.596 --> 02:55:07.757]  Look at how they say veterans are the number one terror threat.
[02:55:08.198 --> 02:55:09.379]  That tells you who the government is.
[02:55:09.719 --> 02:55:12.621]  The government has been totally taken over at the federal level.
[02:55:14.232 --> 02:55:17.175]  And the good part about this show is to put it all in perspective as a think tank.
[02:55:17.535 --> 02:55:19.977]  For even members of Congress, a bunch of them, listen.
[02:55:20.818 --> 02:55:21.699]  A lot of them listen.
[02:55:23.361 --> 02:55:30.107]  And I get Congressman, I go, I was listening to your show yesterday about the more people dying from honeybees things than dying from terrorism.
[02:55:30.127 --> 02:55:36.052]  I called another congressperson, well we listened, we heard you two days ago, but you know, we're not doing interviews right now, you know, we're afraid to come on.
[02:55:38.151 --> 02:55:42.754]  And everybody just stands around going, it's kind of crazy you talk about Russian troops in America.
[02:55:42.934 --> 02:55:47.357]  It's kind of crazy you talk about, you know, billions of bullets in the training manual saying it's for gun owners.
[02:55:47.617 --> 02:55:48.598]  Well, it says that.
[02:55:49.378 --> 02:55:55.822]  The government is arming and training against us and then having drills where they train to take us on with foreign troops.
[02:55:55.842 --> 02:56:02.987]  I mean, the first time I went to one of these drills and everything the old timers had told me was all true, including Raymond Teague.
[02:56:04.113 --> 02:56:08.036]  Who was telling me all this stuff, and I didn't completely believe it, and then it all came true.
[02:56:08.076 --> 02:56:14.442]  Because he worked in Air Force Intelligence with access to all the NSA stuff, and then he worked in other classified areas.
[02:56:15.122 --> 02:56:18.965]  And again, these guys would then go and warn people, uh, there's a plan to bring in foreign troops.
[02:56:19.426 --> 02:56:20.447]  Oh, that guy's crazy.
[02:56:20.707 --> 02:56:21.828]  No, they saw it.
[02:56:22.008 --> 02:56:25.271]  They were there before we were, before it was rolled out against us.
[02:56:27.645 --> 02:56:29.686]  I'm going to come back and do some overdrive.
[02:56:29.726 --> 02:56:31.127]  Some stations carry it, others don't.
[02:56:31.187 --> 02:56:32.807]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:56:33.247 --> 02:56:36.849]  I want to get into this video that's up on Infowars.com.
[02:56:37.289 --> 02:56:39.250]  The guy videotaping police, there's a whole bunch of them.
[02:56:39.670 --> 02:56:40.851]  He's like 60 yards away.
[02:56:41.371 --> 02:56:45.593]  They come over and say, turn around, I'm putting you in handcuffs for filming us.
[02:56:46.653 --> 02:56:52.216]  And then it looks like one of the cops punches him in the face and the guy's dog jumps out of his car and runs over and they shoot it.
[02:56:53.076 --> 02:56:57.018]  And the cops are usually saying, well, this is a great thing because you're in Fallujah, folks.
[02:56:58.840 --> 02:57:01.321]  And now the CPS is coming in people's houses for no reason.
[02:57:01.641 --> 02:57:04.123]  And said they're going to take your kids without even having a reason to do it.
[02:57:04.523 --> 02:57:05.103]  It's insane.
[02:57:05.143 --> 02:57:07.825]  As I end this hour, please spread the word about the broadcast.
[02:57:07.845 --> 02:57:09.966]  We're going 110% against the New World Order.

[03:00:24.146 --> 03:00:31.932]  All right, Professor Griff, famous founder of Public Enemy, got off his bus, got checked in his hotel in Austin, and he was getting in a car.
[03:00:33.365 --> 03:00:35.806]  The next five minutes to drive over here to the studio.
[03:00:37.367 --> 03:00:40.628]  And he should be in there the last 30 minutes of the hour, so that should be interesting, get to meet him in person.
[03:00:41.789 --> 03:00:42.849]  So we're going to continue on.
[03:00:42.869 --> 03:00:47.151]  I want to give the phone number out to the military and police specifically.
[03:00:48.359 --> 03:00:58.171]  Homeland Security has now put out a public press release that Russian police and military are going to be here advising in advance and helping search American citizens.
[03:00:59.613 --> 03:01:00.795]  I mean, I told you that was coming.
[03:01:00.815 --> 03:01:03.037]  I mean, I've been to the Urban Warfare drills, but this has gone on forever.
[03:01:03.738 --> 03:01:05.900]  But they do this just to get everybody conditioned.
[03:01:06.480 --> 03:01:08.101]  And are you agreeing with what I'm saying?
[03:01:08.121 --> 03:01:08.822]  Are you disagreeing?
[03:01:09.262 --> 03:01:10.263]  I'd like to hear from you.

[03:01:15.026 --> 03:01:19.129]  And I'll go to you quickly, because Griff's coming up in about 30 minutes.
[03:01:19.149 --> 03:01:23.091]  So I'm going to come back, cover some news briefly, and then I want to get your take on this.
[03:01:24.332 --> 03:01:26.193]  This is paramilitary training you've been given.
[03:01:27.094 --> 03:01:32.598]  In fact, when you guys printed me the article, it was in the Wall Street Journal, but in a couple others, it was police train that citizens are insurgents.
[03:01:34.551 --> 03:01:37.553]  And of course that's only in high crime areas, but then it's in every area.
[03:01:37.893 --> 03:01:38.874]  It's all military.
[03:01:40.115 --> 03:01:44.838]  And then the public starts taking on the idea that you're the enemy as well.
[03:01:45.659 --> 03:01:46.439]  This is the plan.
[03:01:47.400 --> 03:01:54.144]  They put us into these roles, citizen and police, and then just condition everybody to basically line up with each other and fight.
[03:01:54.685 --> 03:01:56.666]  I'd rather we wake up and realize what's happening.
[03:01:56.686 --> 03:01:56.726]  800-259-9231
[03:02:01.673 --> 03:02:05.555]  And again, I don't want to hear, oh, they're just giving us their advice on how they set up police states over there.
[03:02:07.936 --> 03:02:08.916]  I've been to the drills.
[03:02:09.216 --> 03:02:10.337]  I've put out films.
[03:02:10.457 --> 03:02:11.237]  It's on record.
[03:02:11.637 --> 03:02:12.738]  They're all free online.
[03:02:12.758 --> 03:02:20.501]  I have four police state films showing foreign troops trying to confiscate our guns and saying it's for America with the Marines and the Army.
[03:02:21.861 --> 03:02:25.903]  I've shown police state checkpoints with Army and Marines on highways in America.
[03:02:27.017 --> 03:02:31.320]  I've shown police chiefs admit foreign troops with the Delta Force practicing to attack U.S.
[03:02:31.360 --> 03:02:32.400]  cities and courthouses.
[03:02:33.181 --> 03:02:37.723]  And then the John Warner Defense Authorization Act admitting it's for domestic operations.
[03:02:38.384 --> 03:02:39.725]  This is the reality.
[03:02:39.745 --> 03:02:39.965]  800-259-9231.
[03:02:40.005 --> 03:02:45.268]  We're going to go to break.
[03:02:45.608 --> 03:02:52.172]  This is a short segment and come back and go to your phone calls, David and Hawaii and others that are patiently holding.
[03:02:53.803 --> 03:02:56.244]  I see the phone lines have almost loaded up with police and military.
[03:02:56.264 --> 03:02:59.785]  We have one phone line idle at 800-259-9231.
[03:03:02.105 --> 03:03:04.646]  But first, I'm going to cover and play the video here.
[03:03:06.426 --> 03:03:07.727]  All that he did was love me.
[03:03:07.807 --> 03:03:08.707]  Heartbreaking moment.
[03:03:09.087 --> 03:03:14.068]  Police shoot and kill dog that was defending owner when officers arrested him for filming them.
[03:03:14.348 --> 03:03:16.309]  And I would say the guy's filming while black.
[03:03:16.329 --> 03:03:17.409]  Is that why he got arrested?
[03:03:17.769 --> 03:03:20.630]  And the cops have M16s while they're out doing this, by the way.
[03:03:22.757 --> 03:03:25.539]  And the actual police, whatever they're doing, is about 60 yards away.
[03:03:25.839 --> 03:03:27.360]  They've got some cars blocking the streets.
[03:03:27.660 --> 03:03:30.302]  So the guy knows he's been Fallujah trained.
[03:03:30.682 --> 03:03:31.883]  He doesn't get past that line.
[03:03:32.343 --> 03:03:38.567]  And they march over with their M16s, because he's got an evil cell phone camera, and arresting.
[03:03:39.687 --> 03:03:44.050]  And then his dog, with his leash tied to him, jumps out and runs over.
[03:03:44.630 --> 03:03:45.491]  And the cop shoots him.
[03:03:46.920 --> 03:03:48.100]  Absolutely amazing.
[03:03:48.801 --> 03:03:57.763]  But when a police dog gets shot coming to somebody's house, they have a funeral, shut down Houston and act like, act like, you know, George Washington had just died.
[03:03:58.523 --> 03:04:00.504]  So see, it's all about turning your emotions on and off.
[03:04:00.844 --> 03:04:04.425]  When it's the government, oh we have emotions, we love you, oh thank God for you.
[03:04:04.845 --> 03:04:09.047]  And again, I'll tell the story of being out there with a friend that has a boat on Lake Austin.
[03:04:09.547 --> 03:04:10.747]  There was nobody out there yesterday.
[03:04:11.607 --> 03:04:13.648]  Saw five boats, I saw the cops pull over.
[03:04:15.083 --> 03:04:15.724]  The five boats.
[03:04:16.225 --> 03:04:17.246]  I saw two kayakers.
[03:04:17.326 --> 03:04:18.848]  I saw them go over and harass the kayakers.
[03:04:19.629 --> 03:04:23.474]  And when we drove by, like 50 yards away, the cops were bugging their eyes out at us.
[03:04:24.295 --> 03:04:25.956]  We were sitting there very calmly looking at them.
[03:04:26.696 --> 03:04:30.217]  Then they pulled up behind us and were bugging their eyes out and looking real aggressive.
[03:04:31.097 --> 03:04:31.917]  I didn't stand up aggressively.
[03:04:31.957 --> 03:04:34.058]  I just stood there with a smile on my face videotaping them.
[03:04:34.338 --> 03:04:35.699]  And that took the pleasure away.
[03:04:35.719 --> 03:04:37.079]  Then they all waved sheepishly.
[03:04:37.639 --> 03:04:39.540]  And again, those aren't bad men individually.
[03:04:39.860 --> 03:04:44.061]  They've been brought up that that's manly and that that's how you treat the American people.
[03:04:44.341 --> 03:04:45.602]  Because, you know, we're dangerous scum.
[03:04:45.622 --> 03:04:47.342]  We've got to be kept in line for his safety.
[03:04:47.402 --> 03:04:48.383]  We're insurgents.
[03:04:49.983 --> 03:04:50.863]  Everyone's a criminal.
[03:04:50.923 --> 03:04:52.664]  Everyone's guilty until proven slave.
[03:04:54.355 --> 03:04:55.977]  Except for them.
[03:04:56.657 --> 03:04:57.298]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:57.318 --> 03:04:57.358]  800-259-9231.

[03:07:54.778 --> 03:07:57.839]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:11.343 --> 03:08:12.283]  So it's elementary.
[03:08:12.323 --> 03:08:18.465]  There's a global corporate empire that is trying to get rid of national sovereignty incrementally.
[03:08:18.505 --> 03:08:20.486]  It owns and created the dominant media.
[03:08:21.466 --> 03:08:28.148]  And it's now getting everybody used to having checkpoints, being searched, foreign troops, Russian troops here, U.S.
[03:08:28.168 --> 03:08:28.868]  troops over there.
[03:08:29.608 --> 03:08:34.490]  The Army War College now teaches that they're a globalist group that serves the multinationals.
[03:08:34.590 --> 03:08:34.970]  We're here.
[03:08:36.104 --> 03:08:37.044]  We're inside of this.
[03:08:37.104 --> 03:08:41.867]  And then meanwhile, I saw a story yesterday about a cop getting in a woman's face so she kissed him on the nose.
[03:08:42.227 --> 03:08:45.028]  They slammed her down to the ground and then charged her with assaulting them.
[03:08:45.648 --> 03:08:52.131]  Or somebody blows bubbles at a demonstration and a bubble goes by a cop, so they slam her to the ground, charge them with assault.
[03:08:53.111 --> 03:09:00.715]  Or what the woman in Virginia, where they have these liquor police, they come out with a LaCroix's bottled water and cookie dough.
[03:09:01.984 --> 03:09:03.666]  And tell her, uh, roll down her window.
[03:09:03.686 --> 03:09:05.088]  She goes to start the car so she can.
[03:09:05.408 --> 03:09:06.189]  They say, don't do that.
[03:09:06.229 --> 03:09:07.370]  They say, put your hands up.
[03:09:07.670 --> 03:09:09.112]  They say, open the door, but put your hands up.
[03:09:09.352 --> 03:09:13.156]  They knock the windows out, slam her to the ground, charge her with assaulting him on video.
[03:09:15.758 --> 03:09:19.222]  And, and now they assault you, then you're charged and go to the gulag.
[03:09:20.325 --> 03:09:21.526]  And then I see this video.
[03:09:21.567 --> 03:09:23.249]  And again, this isn't anti-police.
[03:09:23.649 --> 03:09:25.051]  It's that you've been brainwashed.
[03:09:25.351 --> 03:09:26.432]  What you're doing is wrong.
[03:09:26.713 --> 03:09:29.035]  Cops in LA get out with M16s.
[03:09:29.756 --> 03:09:32.039]  They've got a dozen police cars blocking the street.
[03:09:32.539 --> 03:09:35.203]  A guy's at the end of where they block the street videotaping.
[03:09:37.110 --> 03:09:42.635]  The cops come over and watch the full unedited video on InfoWars.com.
[03:09:43.315 --> 03:09:48.079]  They put him in handcuffs and it looks like the cop hits him in the face, does something to him.
[03:09:48.619 --> 03:09:51.662]  He turns with his back to the camera and then, boom, looks like something happens.
[03:09:51.682 --> 03:09:56.386]  The dog jumps out of the window, the Rottweiler, runs over and they shoot the Rottweiler.
[03:09:56.606 --> 03:09:58.868]  And now they're saying they did it for the man's safety.
[03:10:00.849 --> 03:10:03.452]  This is how they execute people, a lot of CIA guys.
[03:10:03.472 --> 03:10:06.154]  You've seen the famous case, what was he, Carney, down in Houston.
[03:10:08.424 --> 03:10:09.725]  Famous CIA section chief.
[03:10:09.765 --> 03:10:12.748]  They get him out of the car, his hands are at his side, the cop just shoots him in the head.
[03:10:13.448 --> 03:10:14.549]  They're like, oh, that's a good thing!
[03:10:15.250 --> 03:10:17.212]  So, the death squads are now operating.
[03:10:18.900 --> 03:10:21.581]  And most of them have been in heavy combat overseas.
[03:10:22.021 --> 03:10:24.162]  They've sat there with heavy machine guns at checkpoints.
[03:10:24.482 --> 03:10:27.343]  You've seen the entertainment videos where they just shoot up vehicles for fun.
[03:10:27.743 --> 03:10:33.225]  You've seen the death letters signed by the troops that have been ordered to kill all these people and then come home and commit suicide.
[03:10:33.665 --> 03:10:35.306]  I mean, we're in a lot of trouble, folks.
[03:10:35.466 --> 03:10:36.686]  All this is coming home to roost.
[03:10:36.986 --> 03:10:39.967]  The new enemy isn't Al Qaeda, it's the conservative libertarians.
[03:10:40.247 --> 03:10:41.388]  And what a perfect plan!
[03:10:42.388 --> 03:10:47.830]  This was all sold to conservatives as a way to fight the extreme Muslims when the globalists run them.
[03:10:48.703 --> 03:10:51.425]  So I want to go to this clip and I'll narrate it for radio listeners.
[03:10:52.105 --> 03:10:53.226]  All he did was love me.
[03:10:53.286 --> 03:10:54.067]  Heartbreaking moment.
[03:10:54.107 --> 03:10:58.770]  Police shoot and kill dog that was defending owner when officers arrested him for filming them.
[03:10:59.110 --> 03:11:00.951]  They can make up arguments about the Rottweiler.
[03:11:02.052 --> 03:11:09.777]  I mean, anybody knows you can just scream at a dog and it'll run off if you act aggressive unless it's been police trained and that's usually a German Shepherd.
[03:11:10.258 --> 03:11:11.779]  Those will jump for your throat and stuff.
[03:11:13.005 --> 03:11:16.046]  I guess some pit bulls will jump on your leg, but they're mainly trained to kill dogs.
[03:11:16.847 --> 03:11:20.448]  I mean, I've seen them kill chihuahuas, or they go in your backyard and shoot your dog.
[03:11:20.468 --> 03:11:24.369]  I mean, I've seen them shoot labs here in Austin that are chained up because it's barking.
[03:11:25.070 --> 03:11:26.490]  And it's just total mental illness.
[03:11:26.550 --> 03:11:30.211]  And look, cops, America didn't act like this in the past.
[03:11:30.292 --> 03:11:31.432]  You may think it's okay now.
[03:11:31.692 --> 03:11:32.632]  Why are we doing it now?
[03:11:33.213 --> 03:11:34.513]  Why is everything else going bad?
[03:11:34.533 --> 03:11:39.475]  We're going to your calls here in a moment to David and Propaganda Machine and others that are patiently holding.
[03:11:40.759 --> 03:11:44.041]  We're talking to police and military about what they think of what I covered last hour.
[03:11:44.101 --> 03:11:50.664]  Russian troops in America to patrol security events.
[03:11:50.684 --> 03:11:51.164]  800-259-9231.
[03:11:51.184 --> 03:11:51.965]  800-259-9231.
[03:11:52.965 --> 03:11:54.246]  Police and military only right now.
[03:11:54.606 --> 03:11:55.386]  I want to get your take.
[03:11:55.726 --> 03:11:58.188]  What about old-timers who were in the military that were told about this?
[03:11:58.208 --> 03:11:59.728]  Because it was in government documents like 7277.
[03:11:59.768 --> 03:12:01.529]  State Department.
[03:12:01.589 --> 03:12:02.310]  Now it's public.
[03:12:02.750 --> 03:12:04.851]  What does that mean that now they're doing it publicly?
[03:12:06.443 --> 03:12:09.284]  800, now it's a lot more serious than what they're even telling you.
[03:12:09.304 --> 03:12:11.765]  This is just the ice breaking to make it sound normal.
[03:12:11.785 --> 03:12:12.206]  800-259-9231.
[03:12:12.246 --> 03:12:13.946]  Let's roll this very painful video and audio.
[03:12:13.966 --> 03:12:14.287]  Here it is.
[03:12:20.464 --> 03:12:21.305]  So he's filming him.
[03:12:22.726 --> 03:12:23.887]  Back it up a little bit more.
[03:12:24.307 --> 03:12:30.231]  Because some viewers, back it up a little bit more, because some viewers are going to see this and think, oh, what did he do beforehand?
[03:12:30.791 --> 03:12:32.032]  Show it about 30 seconds before.
[03:12:32.393 --> 03:12:43.280]  So he's behind the police line, videotaping on an iPhone, looks like an iPhone or a Droid, a black Droid, and the police look at him, they have M16s, and they come over, just total goon land.
[03:12:43.321 --> 03:12:43.781]  Yeah, here it is.
[03:12:49.865 --> 03:12:50.885]  He's giving a bravo.
[03:12:51.405 --> 03:12:57.967]  And again, I'm going to talk over it because some of the people filming from across the other street dropped a few F-bombs, and then we'll cue it up to the point when that happens.
[03:13:03.568 --> 03:13:07.969]  Alright, now again, he's standing there videotaping police, and the cops are saying something to him.
[03:13:08.009 --> 03:13:14.171]  You can't hear him because they're about 60 yards away, and they start walking over to the man standing there with his video camera.
[03:13:14.631 --> 03:13:18.812]  And again, what they're mad about is that he's not bowing down and acting cowardly.
[03:13:20.000 --> 03:13:25.441]  Now it looks like they tell him to leave, so he starts walking away to put his dog in the car.
[03:13:25.801 --> 03:13:32.143]  And from everything I've ever seen with these videos, as soon as he acted like he wasn't a threat, that's when they come.
[03:13:32.563 --> 03:13:40.745]  The minute you grovel to paramilitary-trained police is the day it doesn't matter what you do, you're going to go to jail and you're going to have charges.
[03:13:41.325 --> 03:13:43.646]  And they say, turn around, go ahead and fight it up.
[03:13:45.626 --> 03:13:46.686]  And they grab his arms.
[03:13:50.266 --> 03:13:54.048]  And they put handcuffs on him.
[03:13:54.768 --> 03:13:56.269]  And the dog has now been put in the car.
[03:13:56.629 --> 03:13:57.949]  The guy was gonna leave.
[03:13:58.890 --> 03:14:02.611]  The dog's barking, seeing the guy that feeds him being taken away.
[03:14:03.672 --> 03:14:04.472]  They got their M16s out.
[03:14:04.552 --> 03:14:06.653]  Actually, those are MP5s.
[03:14:07.373 --> 03:14:08.154]  Those are Hecklers.
[03:14:08.414 --> 03:14:09.794]  It's 9mm.
[03:14:09.834 --> 03:14:10.775]  I looked at them wrong earlier.
[03:14:13.271 --> 03:14:15.914]  And the dog sees daddy over there being manhandled.
[03:14:16.374 --> 03:14:16.895]  Comes over.
[03:14:17.556 --> 03:14:18.256]  Dog stops.
[03:14:18.296 --> 03:14:19.057]  Dog's scared.
[03:14:19.858 --> 03:14:20.499]  Cops don't care.
[03:14:20.519 --> 03:14:25.504]  They're still gonna shoot it.
[03:14:26.745 --> 03:14:27.566]  Here goes the cops.
[03:14:29.248 --> 03:14:30.049]  Boom, boom, boom.
[03:14:30.189 --> 03:14:30.810]  Kill the dog.
[03:14:31.531 --> 03:14:31.931]  Yeah!
[03:14:32.011 --> 03:14:32.572]  Take him out!
[03:14:34.750 --> 03:14:36.130]  Put George Washington down like that.
[03:14:36.230 --> 03:14:37.171]  Yeah!
[03:14:37.511 --> 03:14:38.531]  Destroy America!
[03:14:38.551 --> 03:14:40.232]  Shoot the guy's dog for having courage.
[03:14:40.872 --> 03:14:42.432]  And it goes on and on and on.
[03:14:42.873 --> 03:14:46.174]  Now, let me show you another article, and we're going to our guest on this.
[03:14:46.454 --> 03:14:48.514]  This is how they handle it in the Ukraine.
[03:14:48.915 --> 03:14:50.695]  Because they're not drinking fluoride over there, folks.
[03:14:51.095 --> 03:14:52.476]  Which lowers testosterone.
[03:14:52.836 --> 03:14:53.316]  Ukraine.
[03:14:53.576 --> 03:14:56.317]  Police units stormed after brutal rape.
[03:14:57.540 --> 03:15:06.704]  Protesters hurled firebombs stormed local police station unit in southern Ukraine after authorities refused to detain one of two police officers implicated in the brutal gang rape of a young woman.
[03:15:07.324 --> 03:15:08.784]  Well, I mean, I'm sure she deserved it.
[03:15:08.804 --> 03:15:10.105]  I'm being sarcastic, folks.
[03:15:10.125 --> 03:15:11.085]  Poor dog, poor lady.
[03:15:11.625 --> 03:15:22.810]  Residents of the town some 330 kilometers south of Kiev continue to rally outside the station Tuesday, booing the local governor and vowing to continue their vigil until the officer is arrested.
[03:15:23.590 --> 03:15:27.351]  During the storming, late Monday, protesters smashed windows, broke doors, and set fire.
[03:15:27.371 --> 03:15:31.153]  And of course, it was the Ukrainians and Polish that finally started fighting the secret police.
[03:15:31.533 --> 03:15:34.474]  Tired of their daughters being raped, they killed most of the Russian secret police.
[03:15:34.814 --> 03:15:36.494]  So, they won't roll over.
[03:15:36.634 --> 03:15:38.135]  And that's why they're called terrorists.
[03:15:39.075 --> 03:15:42.236]  Very painful video to watch that dog up against.
[03:15:42.356 --> 03:15:43.317]  And dogs are smart, too.
[03:15:43.357 --> 03:15:44.157]  They can tell this is like...
[03:15:44.577 --> 03:15:47.078]  You know, three cops with guns, the dog knows it's a weapon.
[03:15:47.098 --> 03:15:49.518]  He gave him a squirt gun at a dog, it starts groveling.
[03:15:49.818 --> 03:15:53.639]  And that dog sees its daddy being drug away, so it goes over to protect him, and they killed it.
[03:15:55.039 --> 03:15:58.660]  And they're gonna make excuses, and they're gonna make excuses when your bank accounts are taken.
[03:15:58.680 --> 03:16:01.160]  They're gonna make excuses when you die of cancer from the vaccines.
[03:16:01.480 --> 03:16:04.621]  They're going to make excuses when Russians rape your children.
[03:16:05.761 --> 03:16:08.722]  It's not gonna be mainly Russians though, it's gonna be Chinese that are meant to invade the U.S.
[03:16:09.022 --> 03:16:13.743]  That's in all the documents, that's why they're being given the Panama Canal and the Mexican ports and all of it.
[03:16:14.634 --> 03:16:16.635]  America is to be gutted one way or another.
[03:16:17.996 --> 03:16:23.499]  And you can bet the average cop out there will be side-by-side with Chinese troops and Mexican troops coming to your house.
[03:16:23.739 --> 03:16:25.961]  They'll do it in a minute, because they're all being trained with them.
[03:16:26.481 --> 03:16:27.982]  Now let's go to David in Hawaii.
[03:16:28.002 --> 03:16:29.923]  David, what do you think of all this today?
[03:16:29.943 --> 03:16:31.144]  Can you hear me?
[03:16:31.464 --> 03:16:32.584]  Yeah, you say you're in the Army, sir.
[03:16:32.604 --> 03:16:32.945]  Go ahead.
[03:16:32.965 --> 03:16:34.285]  Yes, I am.
[03:16:34.305 --> 03:16:34.906]  This is David Knight.
[03:16:34.926 --> 03:16:37.087]  I'm in about 23 years of experience.
[03:16:37.680 --> 03:16:45.347]  I just wanted to make one comment, and then I wanted to say something about that video clip you just showed, and if I have a chance, say something about vaccinations in the military.
[03:16:45.888 --> 03:16:55.416]  But that video clip you just showed of the police officers, I mean, that's an example of kind of an extreme activity that's going on within the police departments.
[03:16:55.476 --> 03:17:00.241]  We do exchanges with other military programs all the time, but to bring in Russian troops
[03:17:00.984 --> 03:17:10.839]  To bring in foreign soldiers, not only is it unconstitutional in the United States of America, but what you just showed on that video clip is exactly what you're going to get with foreign forces patrolling our streets.
[03:17:11.527 --> 03:17:13.788]  Well, we're getting it with our police who've been... But here's the issue.
[03:17:13.828 --> 03:17:18.450]  You can say you train with foreign troops in case there's a hostage situation in an ATO country.
[03:17:18.890 --> 03:17:19.811]  I've been to the drills.
[03:17:20.311 --> 03:17:25.293]  They say it's one thing, but really, it was for the occupation of the Bay Area and gun confiscation.
[03:17:25.613 --> 03:17:33.417]  I was able to get interrogations on video and have Marines off record admit what was going on, and then the Colonel Love freaked out when he found out I had it on tape.
[03:17:33.937 --> 03:17:35.719]  That's because it's meant to acclimate you.
[03:17:35.979 --> 03:17:37.880]  This isn't exchange programs, exactly.
[03:17:38.281 --> 03:17:43.445]  Now it's actually running events against American citizens.
[03:17:43.465 --> 03:17:44.205]  What do you make of that?
[03:17:44.225 --> 03:17:45.907]  Exactly.
[03:17:45.967 --> 03:17:46.587]  That's my point.
[03:17:49.053 --> 03:17:53.915]  Other training operations were designed to acclimate people.
[03:17:53.955 --> 03:18:02.119]  That could be, but what you just showed, that video clip of the gentleman with his dog getting shot and him being detained, that is what you're going to get with foreign forces.
[03:18:02.479 --> 03:18:03.259]  The U.S.
[03:18:03.299 --> 03:18:10.762]  military and police force are way more constrained with regards to how we handle people and civilians than foreign governments are.
[03:18:10.783 --> 03:18:13.984]  What you just showed right there, and that little message that you put out about
[03:18:14.824 --> 03:18:15.205]  I don't know.
[03:18:35.744 --> 03:18:41.987]  The French, the British, separate sides, allies and enemies, remarked on the comportment of U.S.
[03:18:42.027 --> 03:18:42.427]  forces.
[03:18:42.748 --> 03:18:44.568]  So from the beginning, the U.S.
[03:18:44.588 --> 03:18:53.773]  military was known for not torturing, that all changed in Vietnam, obviously, but now we're known as getting very, very bad, according to what I read.
[03:18:53.793 --> 03:18:56.874]  You've been in the middle of it, but I've also seen what's been admitted.
[03:18:57.394 --> 03:19:03.317]  My whole issue is absolutely, in Mexico, in Ukraine, I mean, the cops, if they see a woman, they rape her if they want to.
[03:19:03.817 --> 03:19:05.080]  North Korea, same deal.
[03:19:05.401 --> 03:19:06.743]  We are becoming like that.
[03:19:06.763 --> 03:19:08.547]  I mean, what do you think of the L.A.
[03:19:08.587 --> 03:19:09.729]  police coming over to the guy?
[03:19:09.930 --> 03:19:10.992]  That's an unedited video.
[03:19:11.313 --> 03:19:15.140]  He's just standing there videotaping him, so they come over and arrest him and then kill his dog.
[03:19:16.021 --> 03:19:19.865]  Well, it goes right back to what the coverage of what happened in Boston.
[03:19:19.885 --> 03:19:21.647]  I mean, you're right, the shoot.
[03:19:21.707 --> 03:19:23.089]  Dave Grossman calls him the shoot.
[03:19:23.249 --> 03:19:32.178]  Bottom line is that the guy was just taking a video, just like all those people in Boston, cowering in their homes and just waiting to get their homes kicked in so they can get taken out of them.
[03:19:32.258 --> 03:19:34.681]  I mean, me and my wife watch a TV and it's absolutely ridiculous.
[03:19:34.801 --> 03:19:59.451]  Listen, the cops, it was a game warden and a regular, I think it was Travis County, on the river yesterday, and they were driving around with their jaws stuck out, bugging out, like they were bad guys in a movie, and I just got up and started basically laughing at them, and then they waved and drove off, but I don't understand the mindset where people bug their eyes out at you and treat you like, because, you know,
[03:20:00.680 --> 03:20:10.909]  They treated me like the few times I was in Juvenile Hall for fights I'd get in and the cops get there and, you know, somebody's going in a hospital, you go to jail even if you're found not guilty later or they drop the charges.
[03:20:11.589 --> 03:20:13.091]  I've experienced being in jail.
[03:20:13.691 --> 03:20:17.615]  And the way the police act now in general is like I'm a perpetrator.
[03:20:17.895 --> 03:20:19.376]  I'm already locked up in jail.
[03:20:19.416 --> 03:20:20.217]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[03:20:20.557 --> 03:20:25.221]  I mean, they really act aggressive and it's just, it's what I've experienced in third world countries.
[03:20:25.601 --> 03:20:27.183]  It's why I don't go to third world countries.
[03:20:27.583 --> 03:20:31.670]  My parents drug me to all sorts of third world countries when I was a kid because they wanted to go see stuff.
[03:20:32.011 --> 03:20:33.594]  And I didn't like it when I was a kid.
[03:20:33.614 --> 03:20:34.876]  I don't like it now.
[03:20:34.936 --> 03:20:35.717]  What do you have to say to that?
[03:20:36.633 --> 03:20:37.994]  No, I know, it's spot on.
[03:20:38.034 --> 03:20:40.856]  I know that all the people around the continent of the U.S.
[03:20:40.876 --> 03:20:43.318]  are all like, man, this isn't going to foreign countries so cool, so cool.
[03:20:43.358 --> 03:20:46.521]  And I said, hey, I've been to a lot of those foreign countries and it ain't cool.
[03:20:46.601 --> 03:20:54.467]  Nice place to see, watch them on TV, but you don't want to go to these other countries because what they do to people, innocent people, it's horrendous.
[03:20:54.487 --> 03:20:55.467]  So, I'm with you.
[03:20:55.507 --> 03:20:57.129]  Oh yeah, they target innocent people.
[03:20:57.369 --> 03:21:02.453]  And to see America that used to be better, it really was, to now see us acting like
[03:21:03.883 --> 03:21:08.026]  Mexico or Honduras, the stuff I've seen, is just very upsetting.
[03:21:08.727 --> 03:21:09.427]  I'll be honest, though.
[03:21:09.607 --> 03:21:12.189]  I smile at them and show nice body language.
[03:21:12.229 --> 03:21:14.331]  I videotape police at checkpoints in Mexico.
[03:21:14.931 --> 03:21:16.192]  I videotape stuff like that.
[03:21:16.232 --> 03:21:21.616]  And then they kind of look at you, but when you're not scared, then they just kind of go, well, that guy must be in charge or something.
[03:21:21.676 --> 03:21:25.759]  But what's sad is when a family grovels, then they are mean to them.
[03:21:26.519 --> 03:21:29.962]  And as soon as the cops tell the guy to leave, and he does, then they come after him.
[03:21:31.546 --> 03:21:34.211]  I think he should have argued with him and said, hey, it's my First Amendment.
[03:21:34.491 --> 03:21:36.294]  Then the dog would have seen that body language.
[03:21:37.076 --> 03:21:40.923]  In my experience, if you grovel with bad cops, you're going to jail.
[03:21:43.184 --> 03:21:58.615]  Well, I mean, I'm not gonna... I don't have the experience with actually arguing with cops, but I do know... I mean, I've had confrontations, you know, over the years, and I will tell you, that groveling is never the answer because, you know, the world, so to speak, aggressive people are going to feed on you being weak, and that's exactly what happened.
[03:21:58.635 --> 03:22:01.457]  The guy started complying with him, and he's like, dude, I didn't do nothing.
[03:22:01.477 --> 03:22:02.438]  I would have got in the car and drove off.
[03:22:03.058 --> 03:22:08.139]  But I mean, you know, but he complied with them, and for them to just come down the street like that was completely out of line.
[03:22:08.179 --> 03:22:10.099]  There was no reason for them to do what they did.
[03:22:10.259 --> 03:22:10.699]  Exactly.
[03:22:10.739 --> 03:22:11.700]  I'm going to run into some other callers.
[03:22:11.720 --> 03:22:12.420]  God bless you, sir.
[03:22:12.500 --> 03:22:13.240]  I mean, I know this.
[03:22:13.680 --> 03:22:18.561]  Most cops we run into are nice and friendly, but it's whatever ones they've got that are interfacing with the general public.
[03:22:18.901 --> 03:22:23.582]  In the old days, you called a cop if something was going on, or if they were driving around and saw something, they dealt with it.
[03:22:23.882 --> 03:22:25.402]  Now it's all about general public.
[03:22:25.442 --> 03:22:26.842]  It's all about we've done something wrong.
[03:22:27.542 --> 03:22:31.523]  And for me to look at us the way that those cops were looking at other people,
[03:22:33.138 --> 03:22:44.467]  I would, I mean, if I was driving up to somebody, looking at them, the way these cops were looking at families with kids and stuff, I mean, I look at somebody like this if I'm coming to beat the brains out.
[03:22:45.808 --> 03:22:52.092]  I mean, if I've got my jaw out and my eyes open up and I'm bugging my eyes out and trying to, I mean, I don't try to intimidate people.
[03:22:52.333 --> 03:22:55.115]  I mean, if I'm looking like that, you are about to get stomped on.
[03:22:55.925 --> 03:22:57.386]  And so somebody starts looking at me like that.
[03:22:57.426 --> 03:22:58.186]  I'm like that dog.
[03:22:58.246 --> 03:23:02.569]  I'm able to go, and start, you know, thinking, I just can't help it.
[03:23:02.589 --> 03:23:04.510]  I'm like, I just can't help it anymore.
[03:23:04.850 --> 03:23:06.391]  That's why I will not go to third world countries.
[03:23:07.052 --> 03:23:19.379]  Cause when I've watched Mexican troops and police sit there and pull over the bus and grab the money from the bus driver and laugh at them and the guy's crying and the cops are all arrogant and sticking their chest out and like enjoying their criminality.
[03:23:19.399 --> 03:23:21.000]  And then I see that in American cops.
[03:23:21.040 --> 03:23:25.123]  I just start going, I just can't handle it.
[03:23:25.879 --> 03:23:27.340]  All right, let's go ahead and take another call here.
[03:23:27.400 --> 03:23:30.961]  Propaganda Machine, who's in the Air Force, from FEMA Region 9.
[03:23:31.881 --> 03:23:33.702]  Formally, what area were you in?
[03:23:33.722 --> 03:23:35.583]  You're now under Globalist Occupied Region 9.
[03:23:36.203 --> 03:23:36.903]  What area is that?
[03:23:36.963 --> 03:23:41.545]  That's up in... That's, no, Region 9, I think, is West Coast.
[03:23:41.785 --> 03:23:42.205]  That's right.
[03:23:42.245 --> 03:23:42.665]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:23:42.785 --> 03:23:43.686]  Yeah, there's two areas.
[03:23:43.766 --> 03:23:48.067]  Yeah, one of them's... I guess you're the Southwest Coast, and the North is Region 10, right?
[03:23:50.208 --> 03:23:51.389]  Yeah, I think you're right about that.
[03:23:51.529 --> 03:23:52.469]  Good to know you're regions.
[03:23:53.369 --> 03:23:54.630]  Good to know you're under FEMA occupation.
[03:23:54.650 --> 03:23:54.910]  Go ahead.
[03:23:56.132 --> 03:24:08.057]  Anyways, hey, everything you've been talking about is right on, but I think for a lot of folks, for the average folks, the people that are recently awake, it's maybe a little overwhelming.
[03:24:08.497 --> 03:24:22.823]  And I wanted to suggest something that's maybe not so overwhelming, you know, something to wake other people up that is a movie that's been out for a long time, a movie that I think is older than you and about as old as I am.
[03:24:23.755 --> 03:24:28.159]  It's a movie from the 60s, and it's called Fahrenheit 451.
[03:24:28.339 --> 03:24:31.823]  And it's a pretty interesting flick.
[03:24:32.003 --> 03:24:36.747]  It's got a German actor in the lead, and it also has Julie Christie.
[03:24:36.887 --> 03:24:39.690]  Yeah, that's a book by Bradbury, right?
[03:24:40.971 --> 03:24:43.613]  Book by Ray Bradbury, but this is the Hollywood version of it.
[03:24:43.633 --> 03:24:44.534]  Oh, I've seen it.
[03:24:45.075 --> 03:24:47.157]  A remake of it is Equilibrium.
[03:24:48.820 --> 03:24:50.201]  That one, I have not seen.
[03:24:50.241 --> 03:24:53.543]  But anyways, this one, I actually watched with my family.
[03:24:53.563 --> 03:24:55.084]  You know, my mom is older.
[03:24:55.985 --> 03:25:01.408]  This was kind of a great introduction to her to visit some of these things.
[03:25:01.448 --> 03:25:02.569]  She had never seen this movie.
[03:25:03.489 --> 03:25:09.393]  And it happened about the time of some of the follow-up from the Boston bombing.
[03:25:09.733 --> 03:25:13.636]  And by watching this with her, with some of the stuff that was in there,
[03:25:14.292 --> 03:25:22.417]  I was able to kind of, you know, it kind of inoculated her from some of the official spin that came, because you saw in that movie how things are played out.
[03:25:22.437 --> 03:25:30.862]  I don't want to give it away for anybody, but that movie from the mid-60s is, I think, ripe for a reviewing right now, so.
[03:25:31.082 --> 03:25:31.582]  Absolutely.
[03:25:31.622 --> 03:25:32.002]  God bless you.
[03:25:32.022 --> 03:25:32.923]  I'm going to jump to others.
[03:25:33.323 --> 03:25:34.984]  Anthony in New York says he's police.
[03:25:35.044 --> 03:25:36.285]  Are you current or retired, Anthony?
[03:25:40.350 --> 03:25:41.530]  Go ahead, Anthony, are you there, buddy?
[03:25:41.550 --> 03:25:43.311]  Yeah, how you doing Alex?
[03:25:43.451 --> 03:25:45.192]  Good, are you currently on the force or retired?
[03:25:45.432 --> 03:25:48.353]  Yeah, and I'm still working.
[03:25:49.013 --> 03:25:54.135]  And I'd just like to make a comment about the police shooting, the video that you were just talking about.
[03:25:55.136 --> 03:25:55.356]  Yes.
[03:25:55.676 --> 03:26:00.518]  Okay, just to let you know, a couple bad apples could definitely spoil a whole bunch.
[03:26:01.998 --> 03:26:06.420]  I did see the guy videotaping the two police officers, in my opinion.
[03:26:07.678 --> 03:26:15.020]  I don't want to Monday night quarterback it, but you could simply weave and ignore people videotaping, because that's what you're allowed to do.
[03:26:16.700 --> 03:26:24.142]  You know, for the most part, the police officer that drew his gun and shot the dog, I did see the dog jump.
[03:26:24.262 --> 03:26:28.423]  But you know what, it's not the streets aren't the okay corral.
[03:26:29.403 --> 03:26:35.865]  Some people to pull and draw, shoot a dog like that.
[03:26:37.313 --> 03:26:43.316]  A bullet can definitely ricochet off of... Oh yeah, that was pretty dangerous that close.
[03:26:43.336 --> 03:26:47.617]  Well, for those that don't know, around here they shoot dogs if they just bark at them.
[03:26:48.158 --> 03:26:50.399]  I think once they escalated, the dog's leaping.
[03:26:50.479 --> 03:26:55.441]  I know why they shot it, but why did they immediately grab the guy?
[03:26:55.501 --> 03:26:59.242]  Why'd they start manhandling him when they could see a dog was hanging out a window?
[03:26:59.262 --> 03:27:00.903]  I would have said, go put your dog up.
[03:27:01.223 --> 03:27:02.624]  Even if they were going to arrest him,
[03:27:03.889 --> 03:27:05.031]  Uh, for no reason.
[03:27:05.051 --> 03:27:10.217]  I mean, we do have a right to videotape police, the Supreme Court's ruled, as long as it doesn't interfere with their duties.
[03:27:10.518 --> 03:27:12.540]  And I don't think 60 yards away he was doing that.
[03:27:13.183 --> 03:27:13.603]  Yes, sir.
[03:27:13.723 --> 03:27:14.344]  I agree with you.
[03:27:14.544 --> 03:27:18.827]  Um, but I do definitely think that there should be some kind of retraining.
[03:27:19.228 --> 03:27:25.192]  Because like I said, when you get into the police department, Alex, we're just all normal people.
[03:27:25.432 --> 03:27:26.173]  Okay.
[03:27:26.253 --> 03:27:26.853]  Just like you.
[03:27:26.873 --> 03:27:37.141]  A lot of times we don't talk to the news because everything we say or do is misconstrued by the media to make us look bad.
[03:27:37.381 --> 03:27:37.622]  Sure.
[03:27:37.702 --> 03:27:41.805]  When that that's why a lot of times when you say all this, you know, they
[03:27:42.640 --> 03:27:50.224]  The police just don't talk or they just give orders because when the news is there, a lot of times things are cut and put on the news.
[03:27:50.264 --> 03:27:52.686]  No, no, I know how the mainstream media is, you know, and I understand that.
[03:27:52.906 --> 03:28:00.070]  That's why I said I don't want to just be in a fight with the police because that's what they want is an us against them, another form of balkanization.
[03:28:00.390 --> 03:28:03.872]  But I'm saying the training, the direction is authoritarian.
[03:28:03.912 --> 03:28:07.354]  They want to make the American police forces authoritarian.
[03:28:07.614 --> 03:28:15.839]  Real quick, what is your take on the Russian troops to not be part of a drill, but to actually oversee security operations against the American people?
[03:28:15.859 --> 03:28:17.320]  Yeah, it's bad news.
[03:28:17.340 --> 03:28:20.663]  Did you ever think they'd openly announce that?
[03:28:20.823 --> 03:28:21.023]  No.
[03:28:21.543 --> 03:28:22.584]  No, absolutely not.
[03:28:23.585 --> 03:28:24.525]  I don't really see it.
[03:28:24.545 --> 03:28:36.193]  I mean, I'm not military, but if I had to work side by side with a Russian soldier, I would hope that
[03:28:37.404 --> 03:28:41.289]  He would have the same views that I have.
[03:28:41.309 --> 03:28:42.570]  We all have families.
[03:28:42.590 --> 03:28:45.073]  We all want our streets and our people protected.
[03:28:45.093 --> 03:28:47.757]  I know, but it's unconstitutional to have our military on the streets.
[03:28:48.658 --> 03:28:49.979]  See, they've already gotten us used to that.
[03:28:50.720 --> 03:28:52.042]  Now it's going to be foreign troops.
[03:28:52.102 --> 03:28:52.923]  See how this works?
[03:28:53.766 --> 03:28:53.946]  Yes.
[03:28:54.566 --> 03:28:55.506]  I mean, here's the deal.
[03:28:55.627 --> 03:28:57.987]  We've got to ask, how many orders will we follow?
[03:28:58.547 --> 03:28:59.828]  How far will we go?
[03:29:00.188 --> 03:29:04.909]  Is there any order that citizens won't follow?
[03:29:05.169 --> 03:29:07.010]  And is there any order police won't follow?
[03:29:08.190 --> 03:29:11.171]  I mean, will we let foreign banks take our bank accounts like Cyprus?
[03:29:11.191 --> 03:29:13.211]  They're saying Congress is having hearings on that.
[03:29:13.751 --> 03:29:14.312]  That's my point.
[03:29:14.372 --> 03:29:16.172]  Is there any order you won't follow?
[03:29:17.873 --> 03:29:22.994]  Oh, well, we'll have to use our own common sense.
[03:29:23.877 --> 03:29:43.312]  When it comes to orders, because I really have never, I mean, if I got an order that I felt that wasn't something that I felt was justified, then I would just say I'm not going to do it because I don't feel that that's the way I want to do it.
[03:29:43.552 --> 03:29:47.916]  You have discretion unless there's something criminal going on.
[03:29:48.816 --> 03:29:49.917]  I hear you.
[03:29:49.977 --> 03:29:51.318]  Police need to support the Constitution.
[03:29:51.338 --> 03:29:51.739]  We're on the march.
[03:29:52.119 --> 03:29:53.703]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:53.724 --> 03:29:56.130]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[03:32:04.617 --> 03:32:07.199]  Nature regularly sends us destructive storms.
[03:32:07.219 --> 03:32:10.221]  24 hours before a storm strikes, people panic.
[03:32:10.501 --> 03:32:13.743]  It would be wise to prepare ahead of the panic curve.
[03:32:13.943 --> 03:32:20.187]  The food price storm from drought and livestock problems is forecast to hit ridiculous heights by the end of the summer.

[03:33:14.530 --> 03:33:20.772]  Professor Griff is here in studio with us.
[03:33:28.082 --> 03:33:30.605]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, I am your host Alex Jones.
[03:33:30.625 --> 03:33:34.788]  We're in overdrive on this Tuesday Worldwide Edition.
[03:33:35.169 --> 03:33:37.711]  And I'm going to try to pull him over to the Nightly News tonight as well.
[03:33:38.271 --> 03:33:44.317]  And I'm going to try to get some of the crew backstage to talk to some of the people that he's on tour with as well to get his take on it all.
[03:33:44.357 --> 03:33:46.739]  But Professor Griff, I heard you wanted to ask me questions today.
[03:33:47.372 --> 03:33:50.275]  Yeah, when your people contacted me, I said, let's do something different.
[03:33:50.655 --> 03:33:58.303]  Let me ask a few questions, um, tapping into the, uh, hearts and minds of the people that are in the street and just some things that they might want to know.
[03:33:58.323 --> 03:34:00.145]  So I just wrote down about four or five questions.
[03:34:00.165 --> 03:34:02.848]  I'm going to shoot them at you and, uh, let's see what happens.
[03:34:03.948 --> 03:34:04.448]  Absolutely.
[03:34:04.488 --> 03:34:16.412]  Professor Griff, again one of the founders of Public Enemy, a hip-hop rap sensation for decades now, touring the country all over the place but also very politically aware and spiritually aware and involved.
[03:34:17.472 --> 03:34:19.313]  Frequent guests or often on guests via the phone.
[03:34:19.333 --> 03:34:20.453]  It's great to have you here in person.
[03:34:20.493 --> 03:34:20.813]  Thank you.
[03:34:21.934 --> 03:34:25.095]  It was great to shake your hand over there during the short break.
[03:34:25.755 --> 03:34:27.557]  What is your take as an army veteran?
[03:34:27.577 --> 03:34:29.459]  What is your take on this whole New World Order?
[03:34:29.479 --> 03:34:35.965]  What is your take on Snowden and now announcements that Russian troops are going to help control the American people?
[03:34:36.325 --> 03:34:38.688]  I mean, we're entering the twilight zone.
[03:34:39.949 --> 03:34:43.292]  Well, you know, I've had this information for quite some time.
[03:34:45.174 --> 03:35:05.360]  Putting this information out in popular entertainment and popular culture, putting it on an album and mentioning it on a CD and talking about it in different interviews, it comes as a shock to some people to talk about how the roads and bridges and ports are owned by foreign governments.
[03:35:05.741 --> 03:35:09.962]  A lot of times people just don't... They're not even allowed to be owned by America under globalism!
[03:35:10.362 --> 03:35:12.343]  And it's the same thing with the globalists on their stuff.
[03:35:12.643 --> 03:35:19.507]  Right, so when you pull up documents like this, and you show the people, and you read it, and you show them the information, they're kind of blown away.
[03:35:19.827 --> 03:35:21.348]  And you don't want to say, I told you so.
[03:35:22.148 --> 03:35:31.973]  So we're at that stage of the game now in popular entertainment, in popular culture, where we actually put it in a song and let them know that this is what's going on, whether you like it or not.
[03:35:32.053 --> 03:35:33.374]  Study it or be a victim of it.
[03:35:33.774 --> 03:35:34.954]  It's like $21 billion to ship
[03:35:36.877 --> 03:35:40.402]  General Motors to China, and it doesn't even help the Chinese people.
[03:35:40.582 --> 03:35:40.802]  Right.
[03:35:40.902 --> 03:35:42.324]  They're building robots to replace them.
[03:35:42.384 --> 03:35:43.606]  It's just, it's madness.
[03:35:43.806 --> 03:35:44.387]  Right, exactly.
[03:35:44.427 --> 03:35:51.537]  So these, these particular, um, these jobs and the American people suffer at the hands of people that never cared about them in the first place.
[03:35:51.877 --> 03:35:53.598]  All right, well listen, you've got the floor then.
[03:35:55.139 --> 03:36:00.963]  You've got to ask Alex, but first off, tell us about the websites, your site, Public Enemy's site, and some of the great shows you've got coming up.
[03:36:01.003 --> 03:36:06.486]  If it wasn't my wife's birthday and we didn't already have something planned two months ago with family, I would be coming tonight.
[03:36:06.506 --> 03:36:07.747]  I know some of the crew's begging to go.
[03:36:08.147 --> 03:36:09.048]  You've got quite a lineup.
[03:36:09.688 --> 03:36:13.871]  Oh yeah, we're on the Kings of the Mic Tour with LL Cool J, Ice Cube.
[03:36:13.891 --> 03:36:15.352]  Now these are two movie stars now.
[03:36:16.072 --> 03:36:22.356]  And every chance we get we try to pull them backstage and pull them to the side and say, do you know that some of these things are going on?
[03:36:22.857 --> 03:36:27.960]  And they take to it, but they're strictly about the music.
[03:36:28.400 --> 03:36:31.783]  Do they have any idea how much good they could do if we got them going for liberty?
[03:36:32.143 --> 03:36:33.224]  Ice Cube is the one.
[03:36:33.264 --> 03:36:37.606]  I pulled him aside, him and his manager, and they want me to submit a script.
[03:36:38.487 --> 03:36:40.168]  For a movie that I put together.
[03:36:40.308 --> 03:36:41.189]  Oh, awesome.
[03:36:41.769 --> 03:36:42.830]  Yeah, I'd definitely like to sit with you.
[03:36:42.850 --> 03:36:44.491]  Professor Griff, always waking people up.
[03:36:45.591 --> 03:36:47.273]  I'm trying to get in the best way I know how.
[03:36:47.693 --> 03:36:50.555]  But I'd like to sit with some, put some Think Tank together.
[03:36:50.995 --> 03:36:56.738]  Let's think about some of the things that we need to kind of implement and hopefully Ice Cube will help us get it on the big and the small screen.
[03:36:57.159 --> 03:36:58.860]  He's in the position, might as well take advantage of it.
[03:36:59.639 --> 03:37:00.119]  He's willing.
[03:37:00.260 --> 03:37:00.900]  Well, that's the thing.
[03:37:00.920 --> 03:37:02.061]  You know, it's funny.
[03:37:02.081 --> 03:37:04.924]  You said all this stuff about rappers and stuff that I thought was pretty scary.
[03:37:05.624 --> 03:37:07.846]  And then it all started coming out in the news right after you said it.
[03:37:08.207 --> 03:37:08.407]  Right.
[03:37:08.427 --> 03:37:10.889]  About how it's a weird sex cult and Illuminati.
[03:37:10.929 --> 03:37:11.309]  Exactly.
[03:37:11.349 --> 03:37:12.871]  Now they're all bragging that's what they're in.
[03:37:12.891 --> 03:37:19.477]  Yeah, I think now they're trying to make it, well, how do you call it, you say it so much it becomes less important.
[03:37:20.532 --> 03:37:21.273]  They're acclimating.
[03:37:21.293 --> 03:37:22.115]  They're just throwing it out there.
[03:37:22.135 --> 03:37:22.776]  It's a fad.
[03:37:23.217 --> 03:37:24.300]  Everybody needs to do this.
[03:37:24.360 --> 03:37:24.881]  Yeah, right.
[03:37:25.081 --> 03:37:25.262]  No.
[03:37:25.722 --> 03:37:27.867]  It's still dangerous and people are still losing their lives.
[03:37:28.488 --> 03:37:29.350]  And losing their minds.
[03:37:29.731 --> 03:37:31.033]  And ultimately losing their souls.
[03:37:33.038 --> 03:37:34.139]  I don't know why they're into this.
[03:37:34.780 --> 03:37:41.185]  Reportedly, Lady Gaga, it's been confirmed by multiple friends and managers, someone has to sleep in the room with her and she's tortured by demons.
[03:37:42.046 --> 03:37:43.727]  And thinks she's followed around by ghosts.
[03:37:44.008 --> 03:37:47.511]  Well, yeah, you're telling little girls to worship the devil, bad stuff's gonna happen to you.
[03:37:47.651 --> 03:37:48.071]  Exactly.
[03:37:48.612 --> 03:37:56.358]  Beyonce has this alter ego she calls, it's the entity that lives inside of her, she calls Sasha Fierce.
[03:37:57.199 --> 03:38:04.888]  Lady Gaga mentioned the fact that there's a young 13-year-old white gay individual lives inside of her, which is called Roman.
[03:38:05.349 --> 03:38:06.490]  So they're admitting these things.
[03:38:06.870 --> 03:38:07.812]  These things are out there.
[03:38:08.052 --> 03:38:09.293]  People are just not taking it serious.
[03:38:09.954 --> 03:38:11.276]  This is actual demon possession.
[03:38:12.332 --> 03:38:19.795]  And they're going to rituals in front of millions of people in front of our- Tony Blair admitted that he falls to the ground every morning and is possessed by the Angel of Light.
[03:38:19.955 --> 03:38:20.956]  This is mainstream news.
[03:38:21.596 --> 03:38:22.717]  And he said, yeah, what's the big deal?
[03:38:22.797 --> 03:38:24.637]  And flops around on the ground.
[03:38:25.058 --> 03:38:26.478]  The devils call the Angel of Light.
[03:38:26.538 --> 03:38:27.699]  I mean, you can't make this up.
[03:38:27.719 --> 03:38:28.439]  No, definitely can't.
[03:38:29.099 --> 03:38:29.920]  Definitely can't make this up.
[03:38:29.940 --> 03:38:34.822]  But these are the things that need to be brought out to let the people know that this is actual fact and this is real.
[03:38:35.919 --> 03:38:39.741]  How can you, I mean, I know you're not around a lot, but how can you be around some of this stuff?
[03:38:39.942 --> 03:38:42.443]  Well, you know, my thing is touch and go.
[03:38:42.463 --> 03:38:43.404]  I guess you're waking them up.
[03:38:43.904 --> 03:38:49.088]  And that's probably one of the main issues why they got a hands-off Professor Griff campaign.
[03:38:49.548 --> 03:38:53.090]  They're going to have to have a campaign because I'm going to get in their chest regardless.
[03:38:53.130 --> 03:38:53.991]  I'm going to be in their face.
[03:38:54.951 --> 03:38:55.732]  You understand what I'm saying?
[03:38:55.752 --> 03:38:56.993]  So they're going to have to deal with it regardless.
[03:38:57.193 --> 03:39:00.095]  Yeah, you're a really hard soldier for the truth out there.
[03:39:00.115 --> 03:39:00.355]  Exactly.
[03:39:00.435 --> 03:39:01.035]  I have to be.
[03:39:01.696 --> 03:39:02.116]  I have to be.
[03:39:03.488 --> 03:39:04.489]  Well, it's all coming out.
[03:39:05.710 --> 03:39:10.274]  I mean, it's coming out, but a lot of them, some of them are still, you know, lip-servicing.
[03:39:10.294 --> 03:39:10.974]  Then they say it.
[03:39:11.935 --> 03:39:13.797]  But in a minute, they're not going to be able to deny it.
[03:39:14.057 --> 03:39:17.020]  But I read about how unhappy all these devil worshippers are.
[03:39:17.580 --> 03:39:20.863]  Whether they're white or black or whatever, it is like...
[03:39:22.458 --> 03:39:24.239]  Reportedly, it gets bad right away.
[03:39:24.379 --> 03:39:26.800]  I mean, it's like they're not even happy doing this.
[03:39:27.360 --> 03:39:28.780]  I mean... No, they're not.
[03:39:28.800 --> 03:39:30.241]  But, you know, they're hiding behind the wealth.
[03:39:30.861 --> 03:39:35.123]  They're hiding behind the fact that they can take a private plane to Central Place somewhere and party for a weekend.
[03:39:35.843 --> 03:39:37.764]  And, you know, drink their troubles away.
[03:39:37.804 --> 03:39:39.565]  But you gotta come right back to the same reality.
[03:39:40.125 --> 03:39:41.265]  Right back to the same reality.
[03:39:42.166 --> 03:39:44.206]  And the music industry is not getting any better.
[03:39:44.727 --> 03:39:46.947]  It's spilling over into the entertainment aspect.
[03:39:47.288 --> 03:39:50.849]  The movie stars, the television stars, and it's spilling over into sports.
[03:39:51.994 --> 03:39:59.559]  Yeah, the National Baseball League, they've now confirmed, people didn't believe it when we first put it out, they've now responded and said, we were just joking, but we do believe in witchcraft.
[03:39:59.759 --> 03:40:03.622]  They put witchcraft, hardcore stuff, up on during the baseball game.
[03:40:03.642 --> 03:40:04.363]  Did you see that video?
[03:40:04.383 --> 03:40:05.343]  No, no, I didn't see it.
[03:40:05.623 --> 03:40:13.089]  I didn't see it, but I know some of the artists, I mean the athletes, can't mention their names just yet, but a lot of them have came out seeking help.
[03:40:13.729 --> 03:40:15.090]  How do they deal with this kind of thing?
[03:40:15.290 --> 03:40:24.273]  Because they're being asked to be a part of this commercial, this television show, this movie, this cult, in order to enhance their careers.
[03:40:24.754 --> 03:40:25.494]  And this is very real.
[03:40:26.034 --> 03:40:26.814]  You know what's happening?
[03:40:26.854 --> 03:40:27.495]  I got you in here.
[03:40:27.535 --> 03:40:29.676]  I'm going to have to get you on the nightly news.
[03:40:29.756 --> 03:40:30.776]  Ask your questions, my friend.
[03:40:30.936 --> 03:40:36.158]  Well, one of my first questions is, um, can you comment on the revelations about the U.S.
[03:40:36.278 --> 03:40:39.699]  domestic spying, and how does that affect the average person on the street?
[03:40:39.719 --> 03:40:40.559]  But I want to ask you that.
[03:40:40.959 --> 03:40:47.501]  No, but I think the people in the street want to know from you that Professor Griffith's asking this question for them.
[03:40:48.181 --> 03:40:48.722]  Absolutely.
[03:40:49.142 --> 03:40:51.984]  Average cat with an iPhone with some of his songs on it.
[03:40:52.024 --> 03:40:53.465]  He doesn't think it affects him.
[03:40:53.705 --> 03:40:54.666]  This is why it affects you.
[03:40:54.686 --> 03:40:56.807]  People say, well I'm not a spy, I'm not a terrorist, why do I care?
[03:40:56.868 --> 03:40:58.589]  No, they're there to make sure the terrorists can attack.
[03:40:58.609 --> 03:40:59.429]  They run Al Qaeda.
[03:40:59.670 --> 03:41:02.352]  They run the extremist groups to get Islam killing each other.
[03:41:02.392 --> 03:41:03.192]  That's all on record.
[03:41:03.793 --> 03:41:11.158]  They want to know what you believe and what you think to use that intel to be able to package propaganda to effectively control you.
[03:41:11.198 --> 03:41:11.878]  It's the same reason
[03:41:12.719 --> 03:41:15.862]  People say, I have nothing to hide, I'll put where I live and what I own on Facebook.
[03:41:16.102 --> 03:41:17.583]  Then thieves use that to rob you.
[03:41:17.783 --> 03:41:20.005]  Well, think about the globalists as the big thieves in the sky.
[03:41:20.445 --> 03:41:21.546]  Google, the all-seeing eye.
[03:41:21.967 --> 03:41:26.550]  Frodo hadn't done anything wrong, but why did he not want to be seen by Sauron?
[03:41:26.591 --> 03:41:27.571]  Because Sauron wanted to kill him.
[03:41:27.932 --> 03:41:29.953]  It's like, your privacy is to protect you.
[03:41:30.874 --> 03:41:32.896]  Because if you don't have privacy, you don't have freedom.
[03:41:32.956 --> 03:41:42.965]  So, they're using the NSA to spy on everybody, to know your mind, to build a database on you, and they can also break into your computer and plant stuff on you.
[03:41:43.165 --> 03:41:44.726]  That's another reason the back doors are bad.
[03:41:44.966 --> 03:41:45.427]  You're right.
[03:41:46.087 --> 03:41:52.513]  The average person that uses Facebook, how would their information be used against them in the future?
[03:41:53.593 --> 03:41:58.775]  It's given to the FBI to create digital face print scans, so face scanning cameras can track everywhere you go.
[03:41:59.135 --> 03:42:03.696]  And then Facebook, to prove that it's your Facebook, will say, are these your friends from high school?
[03:42:04.216 --> 03:42:05.717]  Did you ever ask how it knows a photo?
[03:42:05.737 --> 03:42:07.237]  Is it you and your friends from high school?
[03:42:07.317 --> 03:42:12.879]  It's comparing a face scan with you and your friends to make you interface with it, to give it human intelligence.
[03:42:14.240 --> 03:42:15.843]  The computer is using you.
[03:42:16.764 --> 03:42:18.566]  Facebook is really an NSA computer.
[03:42:18.626 --> 03:42:21.290]  This has come out that is trying to become artificially aware.
[03:42:21.931 --> 03:42:23.533]  And it's using humans to train it.
[03:42:24.154 --> 03:42:24.835]  It's a war game.
[03:42:25.075 --> 03:42:26.137]  Brain fingerprinting.
[03:42:26.157 --> 03:42:27.419]  Is this true, false?
[03:42:27.519 --> 03:42:28.520]  Absolutely, that's what it is.
[03:42:29.261 --> 03:42:35.226]  So if you committed a crime, they can plug you up to this machine and go into your brain to figure out whether or not you committed this crime?
[03:42:35.426 --> 03:42:37.087]  Well, they can also show you subliminals.
[03:42:37.167 --> 03:42:42.131]  Everyone is subliminally being programmed with brain fingerprinting to then have false arrests in the future.
[03:42:42.431 --> 03:42:49.217]  Then they have false pre-crime, where they claim the machine knows you're going to commit a crime, but really it's not true.
[03:42:49.437 --> 03:42:52.419]  But they'll bust some real people with it to legitimize its use.
[03:42:52.499 --> 03:42:52.699]  Right.
[03:42:53.460 --> 03:42:57.143]  Will America account for and admit domestic drone killings?
[03:42:58.775 --> 03:43:03.677]  Yes, they admit the program, but then doubly say it isn't real and you're a kook if you cover it, as Robert Gibbs said.
[03:43:03.717 --> 03:43:04.077]  Remember that?
[03:43:04.297 --> 03:43:04.997]  Yeah, I remember that.
[03:43:05.017 --> 03:43:07.458]  He said, yeah, it exists, but I'm supposed to tell you it doesn't.
[03:43:07.658 --> 03:43:10.600]  Then he laughs at you, which is all part, again, thrown at your face.
[03:43:11.200 --> 03:43:13.861]  Will we ever have a list of people that they've targeted?
[03:43:14.241 --> 03:43:16.942]  Will we ever have a list of the organizations that they targeted?
[03:43:17.442 --> 03:43:25.989]  It turns out any group against the New World Order, mainly libertarian groups, again when Obama's in, he targets the right wing, so the left wing gets behind it.
[03:43:26.229 --> 03:43:29.892]  When a Republican gets in, they target the left wing, so Republicans get behind it.
[03:43:29.912 --> 03:43:30.053]  Right.
[03:43:30.113 --> 03:43:31.674]  And then everybody basically accepts it.
[03:43:32.314 --> 03:43:44.905]  So we talk about targeting in the wake of the IRS scandals, the government using the non-government agencies such as the IRS to target American groups that are not primarily for or against... This is called classical authoritarianism.
[03:43:45.505 --> 03:43:46.666]  Now you have to explain that to me.
[03:43:46.706 --> 03:43:52.050]  Well it's just, that's what every corrupt regime uses, the tax police, to selectively target and harass people.
[03:43:52.290 --> 03:43:54.591]  We've always known they've done this to people that get out of line.
[03:43:54.832 --> 03:43:57.273]  We know they've done it to entertainers and people that don't tow the line.
[03:43:57.594 --> 03:43:59.595]  People get told, watch out, you're going to get audited.
[03:44:00.315 --> 03:44:04.218]  And now they're kind of admitting and all to scare people and to create a chilling effect.
[03:44:04.258 --> 03:44:05.259]  It's really a coming out.
[03:44:05.579 --> 03:44:07.340]  Like Snowden isn't a double agent.
[03:44:07.861 --> 03:44:08.621]  He means well.
[03:44:08.721 --> 03:44:09.482]  I've analyzed it.
[03:44:09.582 --> 03:44:10.563]  This is my opinion.
[03:44:11.383 --> 03:44:17.348]  But, of all the whistleblowers, they chose him because he ran so they can make it look like it's traitorous.
[03:44:17.708 --> 03:44:20.050]  And then they can use going after him as a way to scare everybody.
[03:44:20.070 --> 03:44:21.691]  Oh, that's interesting.
[03:44:23.312 --> 03:44:24.073]  Two more questions.
[03:44:24.353 --> 03:44:35.081]  Has the agenda of the elitist oligarchy of evil changed their plan from what you've observed in the Bilderberger meeting?
[03:44:36.206 --> 03:44:43.965]  Based on the information that you've seen and heard in reference to the Build-A-Burgers media, has the plan changed?
[03:44:45.296 --> 03:44:51.081]  Oh, there's a general mega-plan that's at least as old as 1850 by the eugenicists from England.
[03:44:51.201 --> 03:44:52.002]  I mean, this is on record.
[03:44:52.562 --> 03:44:59.708]  To find out how the body works, to create a scientific way to control people, to set up a worldwide grid of control and then kill the majority of the world population.
[03:45:00.029 --> 03:45:01.790]  That's been their plan for 160 years.
[03:45:02.070 --> 03:45:06.654]  They're only now getting within grasp of it, but their plan is still way behind.
[03:45:07.555 --> 03:45:11.297]  And so they're in a race against free humanity, they believe to become gods.
[03:45:11.317 --> 03:45:16.780]  And they don't want to give this power to what they see as the profane, people who aren't ruthless like them.
[03:45:16.840 --> 03:45:20.562]  So there's a race by humanity to decide the future destiny.
[03:45:20.602 --> 03:45:24.484]  And yeah, they're always fine-tuning the plan, but it's the same ancient plan.
[03:45:24.904 --> 03:45:30.828]  And then when you read back to Egypt or Babylon or Greece, some of the more ancient cultures, the oldest cultures,
[03:45:31.528 --> 03:45:33.008]  This was all being debated then.
[03:45:33.028 --> 03:45:34.449]  It was the same camps then.
[03:45:34.789 --> 03:45:44.071]  People that wanted to give knowledge to the people and bring humanity forward, or the priests that wanted to use it to dominate and control so that they could, uh, believe, uh, they believe become gods.
[03:45:44.531 --> 03:45:45.011]  Okay.
[03:45:45.571 --> 03:45:47.432]  Um, this is a question I didn't have written down.
[03:45:47.572 --> 03:45:50.072]  Um, I wanted to ask you just face to face.
[03:45:50.772 --> 03:45:53.353]  Um, I know you're not a rapper per se, but, um,
[03:45:54.113 --> 03:46:01.678]  You think we might be able to kind of construct an album to get this out for the people that can't necessarily read?
[03:46:01.738 --> 03:46:05.261]  It was a very heartfelt phone call I received from a guy.
[03:46:05.281 --> 03:46:11.045]  He said he's purchased my three books, and he just wants to show support.
[03:46:11.545 --> 03:46:14.388]  By the way, we sell all three of your great books at m4store.com.
[03:46:14.408 --> 03:46:14.728]  You bet.
[03:46:14.809 --> 03:46:15.129]  Thank you.
[03:46:15.429 --> 03:46:17.491]  It's very deep.
[03:46:17.932 --> 03:46:20.495]  People don't want, you know, low-level, lightweight stuff.
[03:46:20.895 --> 03:46:21.135]  Right.
[03:46:21.576 --> 03:46:25.560]  Then your books are what they need, because they're definitely heavyweight stuff.
[03:46:25.600 --> 03:46:26.140]  Very deep.
[03:46:26.180 --> 03:46:33.388]  A lot of great perspective, because I've studied history a lot myself, and I even learned some things reading your book, so we can always learn more.
[03:46:34.609 --> 03:46:35.930]  I believe that's what they're scared of.
[03:46:35.990 --> 03:46:40.452]  I know they're scared of entertainment and music having a positive message.
[03:46:40.472 --> 03:46:50.878]  That's why I've talked to high level people that worked at MTV and a top rock star who were there in the meetings when they said, we're getting rid of all this music that has a political thing for liberty.
[03:46:51.098 --> 03:46:57.381]  We're going to bring in nothing but just thug, kill, death, party, evil rock and roll, evil rap, everything.
[03:46:57.721 --> 03:46:59.142]  So obviously that's the answer.
[03:46:59.562 --> 03:47:05.566]  And it's for people to consume the alternative stuff that in many cases is better and not the devil worship stuff.
[03:47:05.626 --> 03:47:05.806]  Right.
[03:47:05.966 --> 03:47:12.230]  So do you think we can, as Karras wants it, edutainment, marry the education component to the entertainment component?
[03:47:12.430 --> 03:47:13.851]  I'm talking about Griffin Alex Jones.
[03:47:15.091 --> 03:47:16.112]  Sure, absolutely.
[03:47:16.172 --> 03:47:18.794]  Let's make it happen.
[03:47:18.814 --> 03:47:21.855]  Maybe I'll come up with some ideas for lyrics, but probably not very good.
[03:47:21.976 --> 03:47:23.336]  Let's just make it happen.
[03:47:23.556 --> 03:47:27.039]  No, but if you do, I mean you're doing political stuff, it's just that I think it's important
[03:47:29.062 --> 03:47:33.783]  I'm sure you've heard that Paris song he put out like a decade ago about 9-11.
[03:47:33.943 --> 03:47:34.143]  Yes.
[03:47:34.843 --> 03:47:38.984]  And I think of that song, it's like a history lesson in three minutes.
[03:47:39.044 --> 03:47:39.364]  Right, right.
[03:47:39.424 --> 03:47:41.245]  I think something like that's kind of the model.
[03:47:41.445 --> 03:47:46.406]  There's been groups that have came before that have done this thing.
[03:47:46.446 --> 03:47:49.206]  Of course, like Karis One, Brand Newbies, Paul Rudd, The Peaches.
[03:47:49.687 --> 03:47:53.927]  And there's groups that's been out there that's been putting the message in the songs.
[03:47:53.987 --> 03:47:55.568]  But for some strange reason,
[03:47:56.567 --> 03:48:02.509]  They want to make it very cutesy, popular, poppish, and play down, it's important.
[03:48:02.549 --> 03:48:05.270]  No, I think it should be hardcore, like you do and like others do.
[03:48:05.590 --> 03:48:07.171]  Because that's what people need, the truth.
[03:48:07.211 --> 03:48:08.732]  And people say, oh, don't scare us.
[03:48:09.552 --> 03:48:10.672]  We need to be scared.
[03:48:10.752 --> 03:48:11.953]  Fear is there to get you moving.
[03:48:12.333 --> 03:48:12.553]  Right.
[03:48:12.873 --> 03:48:15.054]  People, I mean, you can't just put this under the rug.
[03:48:15.074 --> 03:48:18.095]  You have to admit that it's only going to get worse if we lay down.
[03:48:18.295 --> 03:48:18.495]  Right.
[03:48:19.015 --> 03:48:20.196]  We've been on stage with
[03:48:21.172 --> 03:48:24.433]  Rage Against The Machine probably twice in our career.
[03:48:25.253 --> 03:48:32.375]  And we sit around and we talk, we just say, you know something, they probably don't want Public Enemy in a Rage Against The Machine kind of collaboration.
[03:48:33.595 --> 03:48:38.516]  Because both of these groups are high-packed, high-energy, and reach the masses of the people.
[03:48:39.576 --> 03:48:42.477]  Do you think we'll see these collaborations in the future?
[03:48:45.099 --> 03:48:45.720]  Absolutely.
[03:48:46.240 --> 03:48:52.407]  I mean, the reason I like your music is that it's not about left or right, it's about common sense, waking up, not being a slave.
[03:48:53.047 --> 03:48:59.194]  If you take Rage Against the Machine, incredible music, I'm a fan of the way it sounds, and I've interviewed some people involved, they're good guys.
[03:48:59.714 --> 03:49:04.579]  Like, they're more socialist, but they'll criticize Obama when the rest of the left won't, when he does something bad.
[03:49:05.180 --> 03:49:09.003]  My whole thing is I realize socialism has been created as kind of a fake escape valve.
[03:49:10.064 --> 03:49:12.626]  Because then it collectivizes things yet again.
[03:49:12.726 --> 03:49:19.031]  But that would be an incredible mix, I think, of public enemy and rage.
[03:49:19.111 --> 03:49:20.733]  I mean, I think that would be a great collaboration.
[03:49:20.793 --> 03:49:21.313]  Right.
[03:49:21.493 --> 03:49:31.762]  It's very critical that you talk about this simply because during the inauguration celebration, Lupe Fiasco, I'm not sure if you're familiar with his work, got pulled off the stage by the Secret Service.
[03:49:33.046 --> 03:49:35.547]  Because he wasn't doing an anti-Barack Obama song.
[03:49:35.907 --> 03:49:38.308]  Just basically talking about the government, how corrupt the government is.
[03:49:38.689 --> 03:49:41.730]  And Secret Service shut him down and pulled him off stage.
[03:49:41.890 --> 03:49:42.810]  What happened to him after that?
[03:49:43.071 --> 03:49:43.691]  We're not sure.
[03:49:44.511 --> 03:49:45.812]  We sent, we should call him.
[03:49:45.832 --> 03:49:47.112]  We should try to get a hold of him and find out.
[03:49:47.152 --> 03:49:47.953]  My crew should.
[03:49:48.433 --> 03:49:49.894]  If you've got the contacts, we'd love to talk to him.
[03:49:50.834 --> 03:50:05.505]  We sent Dan Bodondi to the press conferences with the drill they were having in the photos from the Boston bombing and they had Secret Service come over and get in his face and threaten him and it's on video you see all these big shaved head guys come over and Dan to his credit didn't back down.
[03:50:06.306 --> 03:50:10.107]  And then they told the media, you don't talk to him on TV, and the media didn't.
[03:50:10.587 --> 03:50:14.047]  That's how enslaved they are, that they follow these orders.
[03:50:14.107 --> 03:50:17.108]  And yeah, the Secret Service is becoming the Praetorian Guard.
[03:50:17.568 --> 03:50:25.990]  And now look at Obama, the war crimes in Syria, the war crimes in Libya, invading eight different African countries the last six months, putting troops now in Gaza.
[03:50:26.350 --> 03:50:26.450]  U.S.
[03:50:26.490 --> 03:50:27.810]  troops have now been put in Gaza.
[03:50:28.070 --> 03:50:29.170]  It's not even on our news.
[03:50:29.570 --> 03:50:30.671]  It's in the back of Reuters.
[03:50:31.131 --> 03:50:32.511]  And again, Obama...
[03:50:33.331 --> 03:50:34.872]  Only Obama could get away with this.
[03:50:34.952 --> 03:50:36.374]  I mean, people will lay down to anything now.
[03:50:36.614 --> 03:50:42.338]  It's like KRS-One said, in Obama deception, America was on the edge of revolution under Bush.
[03:50:42.719 --> 03:50:44.380]  They put Obama in, everybody just sat down.
[03:50:44.500 --> 03:50:44.680]  Yes.
[03:50:44.920 --> 03:50:47.503]  Everybody got quiet, passive, and laid down.
[03:50:48.023 --> 03:50:48.764]  This is weird, though.
[03:50:48.784 --> 03:50:49.664]  You're asking me questions.
[03:50:49.684 --> 03:50:51.085]  We're going to come back with Professor Griff.
[03:50:51.566 --> 03:50:52.787]  Fire out your website real quick.
[03:50:53.427 --> 03:50:58.752]  www.pgriff.info and www.publicenemy.com.
[03:50:59.052 --> 03:50:59.292]  Sure.
[03:50:59.332 --> 03:51:00.673]  And I bet the show's already sold out tonight.
[03:51:00.693 --> 03:51:01.174]  We'll be right back.
[03:51:01.234 --> 03:51:01.834]  Already sold out.
[03:51:03.095 --> 03:51:13.500]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[03:51:13.740 --> 03:51:17.862]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.
[03:51:18.202 --> 03:51:20.663]  But we can't do that without your help.
[03:51:20.943 --> 03:51:31.728]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at InfoWars.com, you will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[03:51:32.208 --> 03:51:35.451]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[03:51:35.711 --> 03:51:41.355]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[03:51:41.836 --> 03:51:51.323]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[03:51:51.743 --> 03:51:52.904]  The war is here.
[03:51:53.245 --> 03:51:54.646]  It's an info war.
[03:51:55.146 --> 03:51:57.828]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[03:52:01.411 --> 03:52:03.352]  Have you ever consumed protein powder supplements?
[03:52:03.612 --> 03:52:08.734]  I have, and all of them don't taste that good, have artificial flavors, sweeteners, or unhealthy sugars.
[03:52:08.914 --> 03:52:12.995]  About a year ago, I was introduced to a new protein powder that changed my experience.
[03:52:13.235 --> 03:52:18.718]  This protein powder made me feel noticeably better, and it tasted more delicious than any drink I've ever had.
[03:52:19.078 --> 03:52:21.679]  Here's the experience of one satisfied user named Rich.
[03:52:22.139 --> 03:52:30.402]  The term best of all worlds has been belabored to death, and yet I've just discovered a whey protein powder that truly deserves to be called best of all worlds.
[03:52:30.782 --> 03:52:32.362]  Best taste, by far.
[03:52:32.682 --> 03:52:34.483]  Best results, by far.
[03:52:34.783 --> 03:52:39.364]  You almost feel like you're cheating that something that tastes that good could be so good for you.
[03:52:39.804 --> 03:52:41.865]  Thank you, Steven and Cocoon Nutrition.
[03:52:42.345 --> 03:52:45.106]  One World Way truly is the best of all worlds.
[03:52:45.386 --> 03:52:46.646]  The only way for me.
[03:52:47.026 --> 03:52:48.967]  Yours truly, Rich from Georgia.
[03:52:49.307 --> 03:52:50.007]  Real users,
[03:52:50.587 --> 03:52:51.428]  I'm real happy.

[03:54:37.709 --> 03:54:45.051]  And I tell you, you're very nice, fresh off playing last night or on the bus from Dallas, coming into Austin to run over here and do this interview.
[03:54:45.071 --> 03:54:45.791]  I really appreciate it.
[03:54:46.011 --> 03:54:46.531]  Oh, good thanks.
[03:54:46.591 --> 03:54:47.571]  I really appreciate that, man.
[03:54:48.311 --> 03:54:49.291]  Tell us about your books.
[03:54:49.331 --> 03:54:50.212]  We sell all three of them.
[03:54:51.252 --> 03:54:53.432]  My first book is out of print.
[03:54:53.472 --> 03:54:59.533]  The three that I got to you guys, Analytics, it was just 20 years of conversation and interviews.
[03:54:59.553 --> 03:55:04.494]  A lot of times, you know, to get a book like that to the average cat in the street, they're not reading that.
[03:55:05.134 --> 03:55:05.894]  You understand what I'm saying?
[03:55:06.355 --> 03:55:16.980]  I put it in an interview form, like I'm talking to you now, and it's very, very, very, very easy to read, so to speak.
[03:55:17.000 --> 03:55:23.203]  My second book, The Psychological Covert Warmth Hip Hop, which I have with me right here, The Illuminati's Takeover,
[03:55:23.923 --> 03:55:25.344]  That's powerful.
[03:55:25.564 --> 03:55:26.205]  That's powerful.
[03:55:46.880 --> 03:55:48.161]  Well, I mean, take Mews.
[03:55:48.241 --> 03:55:50.102]  I know for a fact that Bellamy's a listener.
[03:55:50.122 --> 03:55:52.423]  I've talked to him off air before, talked to him on air.
[03:55:52.804 --> 03:55:57.766]  His management, you know, Mews, came to him and said, shut up, don't do this anymore.
[03:55:58.147 --> 03:56:01.249]  And even got him to backtrack on some of what he says so he can be more successful.
[03:56:01.369 --> 03:56:01.629]  Right.
[03:56:01.709 --> 03:56:05.431]  I mean, they try to keep people literally on a very short leash.
[03:56:05.691 --> 03:56:06.151]  And why?
[03:56:06.452 --> 03:56:08.593]  Why should you politically have to do what they say?
[03:56:08.873 --> 03:56:10.474]  Well, you know, silence is really no excuse.
[03:56:10.514 --> 03:56:11.775]  And a lot of times when you're quiet,
[03:56:12.642 --> 03:56:16.087]  You know, that's no guarantee that you're going to be more successful.
[03:56:16.447 --> 03:56:22.335]  There's a lot of artists that we can mention that were speaking out, very vocal, ended up being quiet and disappearing.
[03:56:23.817 --> 03:56:24.538]  One way or the other.
[03:56:25.865 --> 03:56:28.306]  That's right, in fact, that's what Jim Garrison said from the Kennedy thing.
[03:56:28.587 --> 03:56:30.268]  He said, if you're public, you better stay public.
[03:56:30.488 --> 03:56:32.349]  If they tell you shut up, that's when they come kill you.
[03:56:32.449 --> 03:56:39.193]  Exactly, because you take yourself out of the public's view and the public's eye, and people wonder what happened to you, and they think you just kind of fell off and stopped making music.
[03:56:39.793 --> 03:56:44.776]  No, they injected you with something and put something in your food or whatever else, and now you have to be quiet.
[03:56:45.817 --> 03:56:48.219]  That's right, they either kill you or brain damage you like Ronald Reagan.
[03:56:48.499 --> 03:56:50.100]  Exactly, and we don't think it happened.
[03:56:50.874 --> 03:56:51.615]  It happens all the time.
[03:56:51.635 --> 03:56:57.201]  You see, young black men think it's a white people eye spy thing that you see on TV and the movies.
[03:56:57.381 --> 03:57:01.245]  They don't think this stuff really happens to real people in everyday real life.
[03:57:02.014 --> 03:57:02.514]  And it does.
[03:57:02.695 --> 03:57:03.335]  Well, they should know.
[03:57:03.375 --> 03:57:05.797]  The drugs being brought into their neighborhoods came in on Army C-130.
[03:57:05.897 --> 03:57:12.541]  See, but when we explain these things, they don't, in most cases, they don't care where it's coming from.
[03:57:13.062 --> 03:57:18.465]  When you explain to them that, look, several years ago, there was an influx of this type of drug.
[03:57:19.166 --> 03:57:22.348]  A minute ago, black people didn't pop pills and do all this kind of stuff.
[03:57:22.408 --> 03:57:23.889]  Now, it's readily available.
[03:57:24.810 --> 03:57:29.113]  And to most cases, to rappers, entertainers, and sports players.
[03:57:32.018 --> 03:57:41.747]  May Brussels did an article and she talked about the CIA doing the Monterey Pop Festival and some of these festivals during the counterculture during the 60s.
[03:57:41.847 --> 03:57:45.370]  The CIA was the ones bringing the drugs in and offering them for free!
[03:57:46.231 --> 03:57:50.214]  And that's all been declassified and then Gary Webb writes about it and they blow his head off.
[03:57:50.534 --> 03:57:50.975]  Exactly.
[03:57:51.055 --> 03:57:53.176]  What do you think about Michael Hastings' car blowing up?
[03:57:53.937 --> 03:57:59.242]  Now that was very critical because I remember, what is it, a gentleman that wrote There is a River.
[03:58:00.713 --> 03:58:02.014]  Uh, Walter Rodney, I believe.
[03:58:02.514 --> 03:58:05.595]  And, um, he died in the same kind of way.
[03:58:05.615 --> 03:58:08.117]  And I say to myself, okay, well, man, that was a terrible accident.
[03:58:08.617 --> 03:58:14.079]  But now that I have knowledge of myself and knowledge of what's going on... What about Malcolm X's grandson?
[03:58:14.119 --> 03:58:14.880]  That's clearly a hit.
[03:58:15.020 --> 03:58:20.062]  Now, that was very critical, but that was very interesting because there was three or four stories that was being circulated at the same time.
[03:58:20.402 --> 03:58:22.063]  And, you know, that's a tactic that they use now.
[03:58:22.363 --> 03:58:23.784]  They confuse you at the outstart.
[03:58:24.568 --> 03:58:24.868]  You know what?
[03:58:24.888 --> 03:58:27.389]  We're going to attend an interview for the Nightly News and you've got to go and get ready.
