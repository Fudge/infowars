[00:00:11.109 --> 00:00:15.331]  If you read gun magazines in Ulster County, New York, you could be a threat to society.
[00:00:15.851 --> 00:00:22.934]  In a series of events which amplify the fallacy of see something, say something, Demir Jurek's visit to the hospital destroyed his life.
[00:00:23.394 --> 00:00:38.501]  Jurek says he was given a gun magazine to read while at the hospital, the magazine had a property of the hospital sticker on it, and a physician saw this and immediately considered him a threat, which subsequently cost him his daughter, reputation, employment, and his own safety.
[00:00:39.401 --> 00:00:52.728]  Remember, earlier this year, Cuomo demanded psychiatrists turn over all records to the state, giving bureaucrats the power to divide families, grow CPS by declaring parents mentally incompetent, and intentionally disregarding patient privacy laws.
[00:00:53.048 --> 00:01:01.312]  Since Durek's nightmare began several years ago, the New York Supreme Court had ruled that the physician in the case had no evidence and had breached confidentiality
[00:01:01.852 --> 00:01:18.405]  And although the state of New York Children and Family Services has cleared Jurek as of 2012, the Ulster County Family Court has thus far refused to reverse the order, which would clear Jurek's name and allow him to see his daughter, and instead has issued him a warrant for his arrest for unpaid child support.
[00:01:18.725 --> 00:01:27.412]  Jurek shares with InfoWars that since the legal battle began, he's been drained of everything, and he stated he can't believe that this can happen in America.
[00:01:28.314 --> 00:01:33.258]  So be prepared if you read gun magazines in New York, Big Brother is watching.
[00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:38.482]  And if you're a veteran, the VA doctors are out to take away your guns.
[00:01:39.103 --> 00:01:40.204]  And it's already started.
[00:01:40.224 --> 00:01:43.386]  What happens when a veteran first comes in?
[00:01:43.406 --> 00:01:49.231]  When they first come into the system, they'll sit with me for an hour, usually on the patient's table.
[00:01:50.605 --> 00:01:52.167]  We see him every three months.
[00:01:52.227 --> 00:01:58.593]  Now what we're doing is we'll say, I see on this progress note that you own firearms.
[00:01:58.854 --> 00:01:59.674]  Is that correct?
[00:02:00.295 --> 00:02:01.636]  And the patient will say, yes.
[00:02:02.097 --> 00:02:06.902]  I will say to them, I have to ask you to surrender those firearms.
[00:02:07.702 --> 00:02:08.884]  Patient always says no.
[00:02:09.084 --> 00:02:09.885]  They're like, no way.
[00:02:10.705 --> 00:02:14.149]  There's a little button called panic buttons that are under every desk.
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.432]  Hit that button, the police come, they already know now exactly what's gonna happen, and...
[00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:27.093]  Okay, you're going to surrender your firearms or we're going to, we're getting voluntarily hospitalized.
[00:02:27.433 --> 00:02:30.335]  By the time the VA police get there, I'll explain to you.
[00:02:30.375 --> 00:02:32.697]  Listen, you know, you're going to be hospitalized.
[00:02:32.777 --> 00:02:37.080]  You're not going to be able to work today or tomorrow or the day after the day after that.
[00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.423]  The way the VA works is we get a base salary and then we get bonuses.
[00:02:42.663 --> 00:02:43.724]  For example, I mean, $3,000.
[00:02:46.505 --> 00:02:56.750]  For a veteran, if I get five veterans to surrender their guns, voluntarily or involuntarily, that's $15,000.
[00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:03.192]  The psychiatrist mentality of a lot of the physicians is, these people don't deserve to have weapons.
[00:03:03.372 --> 00:03:04.613]  These people are dangerous.
[00:03:04.733 --> 00:03:09.035]  These people are, the word now is white separatists.
[00:03:09.781 --> 00:03:22.273]  And if you don't agree with the Obama administration, or your patriot, have a Gadsden flag, listen to, quote, conspiracy theorists like Alex Jones, the physician could categorize you as hostile.
[00:03:22.974 --> 00:03:27.719]  Missing a psychiatric appointment can land a veteran a visit from the VA police and local police.
[00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:33.545]  They call it a wellness check, complete with an interrogation regarding his missed doctor's appointment.
[00:03:34.105 --> 00:03:41.690]  A determination of incompetency will prohibit you from purchasing, possessing, receiving, or transporting a firearm or ammunition.
[00:03:42.091 --> 00:03:45.253]  Gun confiscation is happening already nationally through the VA.
[00:03:46.033 --> 00:03:48.675]  And it's also happening nationally to the citizens.
[00:03:49.235 --> 00:03:51.257]  It started in California earlier this year.
[00:03:51.277 --> 00:03:58.422]  I got two M16 machine gun rifles within five inches from my face on both sides.
[00:03:59.574 --> 00:04:11.721]  One cop came up with his gun in my face and the other one proceeded to put my hands behind my back for the sole purpose of owning and possessing assault rifles.
[00:04:12.341 --> 00:04:18.025]  Be prepared for a national gun confiscation through the Affordable Health Care Act, also known as Obamacare.
