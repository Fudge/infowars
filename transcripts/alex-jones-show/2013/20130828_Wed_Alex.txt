[00:00:02.591 --> 00:00:07.402]  You're listening to GZN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:14.434 --> 00:00:18.657]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:19.277 --> 00:00:20.098]  You want answers?
[00:00:20.879 --> 00:00:21.759]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.942]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.603 --> 00:00:30.685]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:47.336 --> 00:00:57.140]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live and we're broadcasting worldwide on this Wednesday, the 28th day of August, 2013 worldwide transmission.
[00:00:58.181 --> 00:01:01.782]  And we are going to be here for the next three hours.
[00:01:02.663 --> 00:01:09.506]  Mark Moreno will pop in for 30 minutes from Climate Depot to look at the big push to bring carbon taxes into a higher level.
[00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:14.088]  Obama raising the cost of carbon in a microwave regulation.
[00:01:14.128 --> 00:01:16.509]  He didn't even sign an executive order that would be unconstitutional.
[00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.172]  But the big news, obviously, is the Syria situation.
[00:01:22.193 --> 00:01:31.679]  Funny that in this day in history, back in 1916, on the 28th day of August, World War I, Italy declares war on Germany.
[00:01:32.788 --> 00:01:39.250]  So really the kickoff of World War I started right around this time back in 1916.
[00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.192]  Always a good time to get a war going for the upcoming fall.
[00:01:43.332 --> 00:01:47.573]  Always good for the kleptocrats to have a bunch of no-bid contracts.
[00:01:47.633 --> 00:01:52.215]  They've learned that a lot can happen while everybody's distracted and diverted with a war.
[00:01:53.294 --> 00:02:05.469]  Now, coming up here on the transmission today, we're going to look at lawmakers have signed a petition asking Obama to seek congressional approval for Syria strike 56 bipartisan
[00:02:08.653 --> 00:02:13.094]  House members have demanded President Obama follow the Constitution.
[00:02:13.134 --> 00:02:13.314]  Yeah.
[00:02:14.054 --> 00:02:21.036]  A couple years ago, with Libya, they said, we've got NATO approval and UN approval, even though they don't really even have UN approval, to do this.
[00:02:21.176 --> 00:02:30.039]  When you don't need NATO or UN approval to have a military action, it's Congress under the Constitution, under federal law.
[00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:34.500]  It is a high crime, impeachable offense, big time.
[00:02:35.475 --> 00:02:36.696]  That's not debated, by the way.
[00:02:36.756 --> 00:02:37.457]  That's on record.
[00:02:38.317 --> 00:02:39.218]  No one debates that.
[00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:40.899]  But they had top generals.
[00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:43.562]  In fact, will you guys ask McBrain?
[00:02:43.602 --> 00:02:45.643]  He has that actually clipped out for Obama deception.
[00:02:46.064 --> 00:02:57.373]  The specific clip I want, I forgot to tell him this morning, to ship that clip over of Panetta when he was the head of Secretary of Defense last year, saying, hey,
[00:02:58.547 --> 00:03:03.551]  We don't need Congress to attack Syria if we want.
[00:03:03.791 --> 00:03:05.893]  When they were saying, hey, you didn't get approval for Libya.
[00:03:06.693 --> 00:03:08.875]  So we forget that's gone on.
[00:03:09.335 --> 00:03:11.417]  That is a big, big, big deal.
[00:03:12.038 --> 00:03:14.179]  And so now there's not even UN approval for this.
[00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.562]  So this is the presidency becoming a dictatorship.
[00:03:17.882 --> 00:03:20.024]  That doesn't mean Obama will stay in office.
[00:03:20.564 --> 00:03:26.429]  It means the office itself and the bureaucracy and the corporate interests that control it are entirely rogue.
[00:03:27.796 --> 00:03:28.936]  Here's the big news, though.
[00:03:29.957 --> 00:03:33.098]  And I started saying this the last few days, but now it's clear even in mainstream media.
[00:03:33.398 --> 00:03:41.742]  There is a all-out rout right now of the warmongers on the left and the right.
[00:03:41.802 --> 00:03:43.643]  John McCain, Obama, all of them.
[00:03:45.283 --> 00:03:53.247]  There is a total rout going on right now, with even Sean Hannity and now Glenn Beck coming out and saying this could cause World War III.
[00:03:53.567 --> 00:03:55.828]  We need anti-war protesters on the streets.
[00:03:57.153 --> 00:03:59.634]  And our government is backing Al-Qaeda against Assad.
[00:04:00.654 --> 00:04:02.495]  The globalists have finally jumped the shark.
[00:04:02.575 --> 00:04:15.640]  They have finally gone so over the top with jihadis blowing up churches all over the Middle East, from Libya to Egypt to Syria, and engaging in just every form of massacre you can imagine, and in the videos.
[00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:26.489]  Of them, last week, loading the chemical weapons, uploading it on long-time jihadi sites, Zawahari, the head of Al-Qaeda, praising the West for what they're doing.
[00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:30.312]  I mean, this has reached beyond Twilight Zone.
[00:04:30.372 --> 00:04:34.075]  This is Twilight Zone on PCP, with electroshock.
[00:04:34.976 --> 00:04:42.342]  I mean, this is pink elephants floating around, pigs flying, Easter bunnies rising from the dead, dogs and cats living.
[00:04:43.376 --> 00:04:44.036]  With each other.
[00:04:44.596 --> 00:04:48.417]  Wrath of God, uh, type, type, type stuff.

[00:07:13.513 --> 00:07:14.434]  Tyranny is here.
[00:07:14.795 --> 00:07:18.298]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:07:18.659 --> 00:07:20.941]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:07:20.961 --> 00:07:26.407]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:07:26.827 --> 00:07:33.054]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:07:33.474 --> 00:07:39.019]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.

[00:07:43.642 --> 00:07:47.626]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:07:47.926 --> 00:07:53.430]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:07:53.871 --> 00:07:56.853]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:07:57.434 --> 00:07:58.855]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:07:59.395 --> 00:07:59.836]  It's here.

[00:08:27.156 --> 00:08:33.221]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:08:33.641 --> 00:08:35.183]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:42.188 --> 00:08:55.960]  Alright my friends, we are going to obviously be covering the huge geopolitical ramifications today of just
[00:08:57.523 --> 00:09:08.506]  Talk about imminent air bombardments with jet aircraft and cruise missiles of the sovereign nation of Syria.
[00:09:09.347 --> 00:09:15.048]  But I want to make something clear here directly out of the gates today before we break all this down and go to your phone calls.
[00:09:16.109 --> 00:09:16.709]  And it's this.
[00:09:19.807 --> 00:09:43.120]  There has been a war going on against Syria for two years and nine months using brigades of Saudi Arabian and Qatari and Egyptian as well as Libyan Wahhabis.
[00:09:44.541 --> 00:09:46.742]  The folks hired by the British to overthrow governments
[00:09:49.195 --> 00:09:53.237]  98 years ago, the people hired 60-something years ago by Hitler to overthrow governments.
[00:09:54.257 --> 00:10:00.499]  They were nobodies until the British hired them, a few bands, warlike bands, in Saudi Arabia, what's Saudi Arabia today.
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:11.343]  So, when they talk about, oh, the terrible stuff going on in Syria, and oh, the army massacring citizens, they're never showing real evidence of that.
[00:10:11.363 --> 00:10:14.464]  The Syrian military is fighting military.
[00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:27.139]  And then the Al Qaeda forces are chopping people's hearts out, burning down every church they get, murdering Christians, murdering Jews, murdering Alawite Muslims, murdering Shiite Muslims.
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:32.183]  Folks, I'm not an Alawite, I'm not a Shiite, I'm not a Sunni, I am a Christian.
[00:10:32.924 --> 00:10:43.553]  But those are all human beings, and I'm upset no matter whether they're Sunni or Shiite or Alawite or Christian, Coptic, Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, whatever, they're all human beings.
[00:10:45.385 --> 00:11:11.054]  And so to sit there and to watch somebody like Secretary of State Kerry say, we know they did it, without saying the name Assad or the regime, and we know there's clear evidence, and then he says the clear evidence, six minutes into the seven-minute speech two days ago, it's so key, is we don't know who did it, but we know it happened, so we've got to invade.
[00:11:12.329 --> 00:11:15.671]  And then the media went with Kerry saying that they had proof Assad did it.
[00:11:15.951 --> 00:11:17.952]  Folks, they know their rebels did it.
[00:11:18.432 --> 00:11:23.935]  And it came out yesterday in the foreign press, in the Egyptian press, and in the U.S.
[00:11:23.975 --> 00:11:34.320]  press via WorldNetDaily and Infowars and other sites like that, with the videos of last week when the chemical attack happened, that day and the day before.
[00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:37.101]  Turns out that the attack happened before they said it did.
[00:11:38.182 --> 00:11:38.742]  In one case.
[00:11:38.762 --> 00:11:40.123]  Looks like there was multiple attacks.
[00:11:41.311 --> 00:11:57.940]  They were uploading the videos of themselves loading the mortars onto the systems and firing the mortars, the chemical mortars, into the neighborhoods.
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:02.482]  And then the whole media, the Saudi Arabian TV network, they're priming it.
[00:12:02.842 --> 00:12:03.983]  The Saudi Arabian
[00:12:07.421 --> 00:12:14.124]  Head of Intelligence went to Russia and openly threatened, we're going to get to this coming up, and this has gotten no attention.
[00:12:14.144 --> 00:12:15.485]  Steve Watson wrote about it yesterday.
[00:12:15.805 --> 00:12:18.486]  Paul Watson said this morning he couldn't believe it got no attention.
[00:12:19.686 --> 00:12:27.310]  And actually set on record in a council meeting with the leaders of Russia, we're going to activate the Chechen terrorists we control.
[00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:29.731]  By the way, the same ones the West has been funding.
[00:12:30.391 --> 00:12:32.152]  The Tsarnaev brothers were part of that.
[00:12:33.609 --> 00:12:37.172]  The older brother paid by the CIA to go over there, definitely a double agent, bare minimum.
[00:12:39.314 --> 00:12:51.326]  The Boston bombing cutouts, the Patsy's clearly, said we're going to start blowing up all sorts of stuff in Russia if you don't back off in Syria.
[00:12:51.426 --> 00:12:55.630]  And in fact, that's the deals that have been made over and over again is that
[00:12:57.210 --> 00:13:13.858]  Well, the West has said they made deals with Russia, but Russia says they haven't made the deal, that they've been offering the deal, that they will leave the entire southern belly of Russia alone, more than six different stands that border them and then several areas like Chechnya that are officially part of Russia.
[00:13:15.418 --> 00:13:25.302]  There's more than like 15 states, last time I checked, that they've infiltrated with Muslims, Muslim extremists, that they will not destabilize Russia if they give them Syria.
[00:13:25.803 --> 00:13:28.044]  But Russia knows that's not true!
[00:13:30.325 --> 00:13:39.449]  So for someone who's geopolitically informed, it is beyond frustrating to know the facts
[00:13:41.058 --> 00:13:52.322]  And to understand what's going on, and to see the public being led around by the nose about its terrible Assad's crushing activists and protesters.
[00:13:52.362 --> 00:13:53.762]  I know you've seen them say that on the news.
[00:13:53.942 --> 00:13:55.103]  I've seen them the last week.
[00:13:57.364 --> 00:13:58.184]  Four or five times.
[00:13:58.204 --> 00:13:59.364]  I don't even watch CNN.
[00:13:59.404 --> 00:14:01.285]  We just kind of keep it on in the coffee area.
[00:14:01.645 --> 00:14:03.906]  Fox in here, MSNBC over in that area.
[00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:08.131]  CNBC and other offices, so we can kind of monitor it.
[00:14:08.592 --> 00:14:10.573]  So when I say I don't watch it, we just kind of monitor it.
[00:14:10.593 --> 00:14:12.173]  We don't really full-time watch it.
[00:14:12.774 --> 00:14:18.536]  And every time I'm walking by, it's like, well, Saad's killing more activists and more of the protesters.
[00:14:18.556 --> 00:14:21.258]  They're still calling them protesters and not...
[00:14:21.818 --> 00:14:24.199]  Heavily armed with heavy and medium weapons.
[00:14:24.659 --> 00:14:27.841]  Heat-seeking missiles, towed missiles, the list goes on and on.
[00:14:28.321 --> 00:14:32.543]  Obviously being given Western coordination with the satellite and the GPS.
[00:14:33.524 --> 00:14:39.086]  CIA commandos, British commandos, Qatari commandos, Australian commandos reportedly.
[00:14:40.247 --> 00:14:43.248]  Mercenaries, French Foreign Legion, they're big.
[00:14:43.749 --> 00:14:48.731]  Pouring in, in the last six months of the two and a half plus year conflict.
[00:14:50.185 --> 00:14:56.109]  So it's like watching the West start a fight, ten bullies pile up and start beating Syria to a pulp.
[00:14:56.369 --> 00:15:00.552]  They're slaughtering everybody when they get control, unless they're Al Qaeda types.
[00:15:01.653 --> 00:15:04.495]  They're eating hearts on TV.
[00:15:04.595 --> 00:15:05.576]  It's unbelievable.
[00:15:05.616 --> 00:15:08.738]  They're killing children, choking them to death on television.
[00:15:09.078 --> 00:15:12.661]  Stuff we post on InfoWars, but that I can't even watch anymore.
[00:15:13.772 --> 00:15:18.576]  Because, quite frankly, I've become enraged and then become a total jerk here at the office.
[00:15:19.096 --> 00:15:19.597]  I'll be honest.
[00:15:19.617 --> 00:15:21.158]  I mean, because I have humanity.
[00:15:21.518 --> 00:15:25.661]  This stuff gets to me because deep down I understand if that can happen to them, it can happen to my family.
[00:15:26.642 --> 00:15:29.605]  People think of empathy as some loving Christian value.
[00:15:29.845 --> 00:15:31.686]  Really, it's just good instincts, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:31.946 --> 00:15:33.828]  You don't want a bunch of bad, evil stuff going on.
[00:15:38.004 --> 00:15:50.676]  And I see all these yuppies and people that think they're going to be immune from all of this on our viral YouTube videos from the daytime radio show, the video feed, that are posted with hundreds of thousands of views the last few days per video.
[00:15:52.197 --> 00:16:02.687]  I see the yuppies in there making jokes about how it's a big deal that our government's behind rebels launching a chemical attack.
[00:16:04.088 --> 00:16:17.053]  And that top experts like Dr. Corsi and Dr. Roberts and so many others, by the way, they've got top British ministers in the news saying, back off, this can cause World War III.
[00:16:17.293 --> 00:16:18.674]  The hawks are saying that.
[00:16:18.934 --> 00:16:24.256]  General Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, who's known for being a warmonger compared to his counterparts.
[00:16:24.616 --> 00:16:26.997]  The last three or four they kicked out that wouldn't go along with it.
[00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:31.653]  And the head of CENTCOM, Fox Fallon and other people that have actually been in a lot of combat.
[00:16:32.533 --> 00:16:37.037]  They have been holding back all this craziness because they know it can lead to World War III.
[00:16:37.317 --> 00:16:43.642]  But the neocons, some of the people in Israel, some of the warmongers here in the U.S., they want this, folks.
[00:16:45.794 --> 00:16:57.404]  Israel has now produced phone calls of the Syrian Defense Minister yelling at their chemical troops, which are anti-chemical, but also know how to use chemical.
[00:16:57.444 --> 00:16:58.244]  It's always both ways.
[00:16:58.745 --> 00:16:59.405]  Who's doing this?
[00:16:59.445 --> 00:16:59.986]  What's going on?
[00:17:00.006 --> 00:17:03.449]  And they're using that as an example of saying, see, they're behind it.
[00:17:03.529 --> 00:17:06.731]  No, they've now released the phone calls to the U.S.
[00:17:06.771 --> 00:17:07.071]  government.
[00:17:07.091 --> 00:17:08.573]  They're probably going to play them on the news.
[00:17:09.938 --> 00:17:19.842]  Edited, of course, but they admit in the article Paul Watson's got with the links, but it's also in Israeli papers, that it's the head general yelling at the chemical corps, saying, did you do this?
[00:17:20.042 --> 00:17:20.763]  What's going on?
[00:17:20.803 --> 00:17:21.903]  We told you no chemicals!
[00:17:24.044 --> 00:17:26.245]  Which shows Assad would not do this.
[00:17:27.225 --> 00:17:30.927]  That's the evidence that Assad did it, is the evidence that they're yelling at him.
[00:17:31.772 --> 00:17:34.054]  And of course, that's what you do when you're like, did you do this?
[00:17:34.554 --> 00:17:35.615]  What is going on?
[00:17:35.675 --> 00:17:36.096]  What's good?
[00:17:36.676 --> 00:17:39.559]  Of course they're panicking because they've been told they're going to be attacked if this happens.
[00:17:39.939 --> 00:17:46.044]  The last thing, and Israel is, elements of Israel, are using this as a pretext to try to get this party started.
[00:17:47.225 --> 00:17:49.387]  And look, fortune favors the bold.
[00:17:49.527 --> 00:17:52.650]  I get that for some of the Israeli hawks, but man, let me tell you something.
[00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:55.512]  Don't start World War III with Russia and China.
[00:17:55.552 --> 00:17:56.233]  Just knock it off.
[00:17:57.898 --> 00:18:07.484]  And the same thing goes for Obama and the other crazy hawks like McCain, trying to give him right cover.
[00:18:07.984 --> 00:18:10.466]  You know, coming out and saying, it's your fault there was a chemical attack.
[00:18:10.726 --> 00:18:12.487]  You didn't do anything the last three times.
[00:18:12.747 --> 00:18:18.470]  And so you, you did this Obama, trying to give him left cover with his people by giving him right cover.
[00:18:19.951 --> 00:18:20.872]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:18:23.482 --> 00:18:26.744]  It's on record the last three chemical attacks were the rebels.
[00:18:27.004 --> 00:18:31.007]  That even came out in mainstream news here in the United States.
[00:18:32.248 --> 00:18:37.211]  Because the rebels are so out of control that they love to videotape everything they do.
[00:18:37.471 --> 00:18:39.873]  To be like rock stars in their area?
[00:18:39.953 --> 00:18:43.876]  I mean, you know all the jihadi videos that are out there forever, blowing up stuff.
[00:18:43.896 --> 00:18:47.959]  Goes back to attacking the Russians in the stands.
[00:18:48.059 --> 00:18:50.280]  And they would videotape that back in the late 70s and the 80s.
[00:18:51.681 --> 00:18:54.263]  Blowing up armored vehicles and tanks and shooting at helicopters.
[00:18:54.483 --> 00:18:55.303]  They love videotaping.
[00:18:55.583 --> 00:19:02.248]  So they're like going... This is in the Arabic.
[00:19:02.688 --> 00:19:07.051]  Hundreds of these videos, firing every weapon you can imagine, including chemical mortars.
[00:19:07.171 --> 00:19:07.611]  Big ones.
[00:19:09.072 --> 00:19:09.572]  Last week.
[00:19:12.274 --> 00:19:14.035]  It is unbelievable.
[00:19:15.444 --> 00:19:18.425]  And that's why, here's the bombshell news, and I'm going to cover this when we come back.
[00:19:18.985 --> 00:19:25.668]  That's why the Congress, the British government, the French are like, foaming at the mouth for a political diversion.
[00:19:25.768 --> 00:19:26.368]  Disgusting.
[00:19:26.808 --> 00:19:32.791]  Notice they won't get involved in all these other wars, but suddenly, something that might cause World War III, the French government is just totally evil.
[00:19:33.411 --> 00:19:34.732]  Bunch of communists running it right now.
[00:19:34.752 --> 00:19:38.593]  100% plus taxes on the middle class, but the ultra-elite are exempt.
[00:19:38.933 --> 00:19:39.753]  By the way, I'm not joking.
[00:19:39.793 --> 00:19:43.035]  Type in, 100 plus percent tax, you'll get Forbes, AP, Reuters.
[00:19:43.775 --> 00:19:45.577]  Who did Obama hire as his new tax czar?
[00:19:46.958 --> 00:19:51.162]  The communist head of Hollandaise program.
[00:19:53.764 --> 00:19:55.606]  They want to wreck everything, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:55.626 --> 00:19:56.947]  They are the ultimate criminals.
[00:19:58.208 --> 00:20:05.414]  So, we're going to be right back on the other side of this quick break, where Congress is saying, look, we love our grandchildren.
[00:20:05.735 --> 00:20:07.877]  We don't want nuclear war, Obama.

[00:22:38.903 --> 00:22:39.944]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:40.024 --> 00:22:44.346]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:22:44.506 --> 00:22:50.130]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:53.572]  Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[00:23:14.027 --> 00:23:15.208]  What are bitcoins?

[00:24:13.386 --> 00:24:22.432]  All right, my friends, we are back live.
[00:24:23.613 --> 00:24:31.859]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:41.901]  I want to be specific and clear here with everybody.
[00:24:43.701 --> 00:24:52.243]  We're seeing, regardless of what happens, one of the most historic things that's ever gone on, not just in the United States, but worldwide.
[00:24:52.263 --> 00:24:54.624]  I'm going to go through these numbers in a moment.
[00:24:55.364 --> 00:25:04.747]  There are polls coming out, not just in the U.S., showing 91% of Americans in scientific polls are against this war, and it's the most unpopular war probably in U.S.
[00:25:04.767 --> 00:25:05.067]  history.
[00:25:07.458 --> 00:25:10.980]  But polls in Europe are showing similar numbers.
[00:25:13.622 --> 00:25:22.788]  And very quickly we're seeing the alternative media in the last few days force the government and the mainstream media
[00:25:24.482 --> 00:25:39.330]  To follow our lead and admit that our government is funding Al-Qaeda, that NATO is funding Al-Qaeda, that elements of the British and French and Israeli government are supporting Al-Qaeda, and that this is beyond immoral.
[00:25:41.151 --> 00:25:50.016]  And the Saudi Arabian ministers are in public conferences threatening the Russians to basically start a war with them, a covert war.
[00:25:51.513 --> 00:25:56.017]  Will the United States and NATO bombard areas of southern Russia and eastern Russia?
[00:25:56.658 --> 00:26:01.022]  If Russia goes in to fight the rebels, will they call Chechen Al-Qaeda rebels?
[00:26:02.503 --> 00:26:03.204]  Demonstrators?
[00:26:03.384 --> 00:26:03.844]  Activists?
[00:26:03.924 --> 00:26:05.105]  I mean, that's what they do!
[00:26:07.007 --> 00:26:10.550]  They kill police and military every day in Egypt.
[00:26:12.972 --> 00:26:16.716]  And our government is backing them
[00:26:18.697 --> 00:26:21.041]  publicly and calling them demonstrators.
[00:26:21.542 --> 00:26:26.892]  They called them demonstrators killed 25 police two weekends ago.
[00:26:26.932 --> 00:26:27.653]  That was the headline.
[00:26:28.415 --> 00:26:30.378]  Demonstrators shoot and kill.
[00:26:32.856 --> 00:26:35.178]  So that they can make them the non-violent good guys.
[00:26:35.659 --> 00:26:39.322]  It's like when Carney calls it non-lethal lethal kinetic actions.
[00:26:40.183 --> 00:26:43.706]  There's no such thing as non-lethal lethal when they drop bombs on you.
[00:26:44.007 --> 00:26:49.252]  This is the weird games they play and the thing is no one's buying their propaganda anymore.
[00:26:49.672 --> 00:26:52.955]  This is a collapse of the propaganda.
[00:26:52.995 --> 00:26:54.837]  Now that doesn't mean they won't stage something.
[00:26:56.929 --> 00:26:58.150]  In fact, there's news out today.
[00:26:58.651 --> 00:27:05.076]  Oh, intelligence shows Syria may stage terror attacks in America because of America talking about bombing them.
[00:27:05.316 --> 00:27:13.403]  The last thing Syria would do would be to bomb targets in Europe and the United States to then get public approval behind a full invasion.
[00:27:15.164 --> 00:27:17.486]  Even if they get physically invaded by U.S.
[00:27:17.546 --> 00:27:21.390]  and NATO ground troops, they would be crazy to strike back.
[00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:24.012]  Now, Iran probably will if they get attacked.
[00:27:25.896 --> 00:27:30.239]  But I've studied the situation, and all the other analysts agree, that's what's going on here.
[00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:34.583]  And this, there's a real probability of nuclear war.
[00:27:36.124 --> 00:27:46.992]  Russia and China have said they're going to back Syria, and they've moved in heavy weapons, surface-to-air missiles, surface-to-ship missiles, anti-ship missiles, that can go 200, 300, 400 miles, and you're not gonna stop them.
[00:27:51.104 --> 00:28:00.450]  Look at the Falklands War with primitive missiles, compared to the things that they've got now, and how many British ships they sunk with just five missiles they had.
[00:28:04.512 --> 00:28:16.540]  So, this is a serious situation, and once American ships get hit, and there's aircraft carriers on fire, and once there's US aircraft getting shot down, and French, and British, and German,
[00:28:19.324 --> 00:28:23.186]  All the good ol' boys are gonna line up and say, INVADE THAT PLACE, BLOW THEM UP!
[00:28:23.526 --> 00:28:24.786]  It's immoral, folks!
[00:28:25.247 --> 00:28:26.807]  We have been attacking them!
[00:28:27.168 --> 00:28:35.211]  The globalists have been using America to attack and to invade in our name, backing up the most unsavory people.
[00:28:35.231 --> 00:28:44.115]  I mean, you've gotta say, the Al-Qaeda jihadis are absolute murdering scum who just use religion as an excuse to go around and take things over.
[00:28:44.355 --> 00:28:48.277]  And they murder their fellow Muslims wherever they're at, including Sunnis.
[00:28:49.844 --> 00:28:51.325]  They are a gang of criminals.
[00:28:52.406 --> 00:28:53.627]  They are Islamofascist.
[00:28:54.288 --> 00:28:57.490]  And they are funded by our government.
[00:28:57.510 --> 00:29:05.396]  And I hope people... I mean, I've been on so many big talk shows the last few weeks, big conservative shows, and they always apologize to me.
[00:29:06.097 --> 00:29:07.538]  Big regional shows, national shows.
[00:29:07.818 --> 00:29:11.321]  They say, well, you used to say our government was running Al-Qaeda and running the jihadis.
[00:29:11.822 --> 00:29:12.682]  I see it's true.
[00:29:13.963 --> 00:29:14.744]  I see it's true.
[00:29:15.404 --> 00:29:16.946]  And so let's go back and look at this.
[00:29:18.894 --> 00:29:26.363]  I didn't want to get up here and have to talk about all this, but it's true, and they use the threat that they supercharge.
[00:29:28.188 --> 00:29:28.969]  ...to take our liberties.
[00:29:29.029 --> 00:29:31.450]  I mean, once you look at it logically, it all makes perfect sense.
[00:29:31.670 --> 00:29:41.677]  It's globalist offshore banks who make money out of wars and destabilization and can take liberties and sell robots to every police department to disarm bombs, and then they have bomb scares they stage.
[00:29:42.037 --> 00:29:43.198]  This is how they take over.
[00:29:43.598 --> 00:29:51.504]  When we come back, I've got a raft of clips we're going to play, breaking all this down and going through the entire stack of news on what's happening in Syria.
[00:29:51.964 --> 00:29:54.386]  But I've got to say, America is awake.
[00:29:55.246 --> 00:29:56.348]  America is awake.
[00:29:56.368 --> 00:29:58.250]  91% are against Obama.
[00:29:59.031 --> 00:29:59.933]  We're on the march.
[00:30:00.433 --> 00:30:02.035]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:02.957 --> 00:30:05.680]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.399 --> 00:30:12.461]  It's hurricane and wildfire season again.
[00:30:12.481 --> 00:30:20.086]  Why do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year, betting their lives that the disaster won't get them?
[00:30:20.527 --> 00:30:25.190]  Hundreds of you helped eFoodsDirect ship 50,000 donated meals to the Oklahoma victims.
[00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:27.392]  The problem is we can't help everybody.
[00:30:27.632 --> 00:30:28.773]  If every one of us who
[00:30:28.933 --> 00:30:29.313]  I think so.
[00:30:49.201 --> 00:30:50.281]  The $320 price is $50 less than retail.

[00:31:09.543 --> 00:31:13.164]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us?
[00:31:13.404 --> 00:31:18.686]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[00:31:18.926 --> 00:31:26.468]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[00:31:26.648 --> 00:31:35.771]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[00:31:35.971 --> 00:31:42.959]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[00:31:43.119 --> 00:31:46.002]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[00:31:46.022 --> 00:31:51.968]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse, but demand.
[00:31:52.649 --> 00:31:52.949]  War.
[00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:54.451]  Oh, there's another one!
[00:31:54.491 --> 00:31:55.792]  Another plane just hit!
[00:31:55.812 --> 00:31:56.632]  State of Mind.
[00:31:56.893 --> 00:31:58.294]  Because there's a war on.
[00:31:58.454 --> 00:31:59.214]  For your mind.
[00:31:59.495 --> 00:32:03.518]  Get your copy of State of Mind the movie at InfoWars.com.

[00:33:12.337 --> 00:33:13.739]  I'll show you politics in America.
[00:33:13.759 --> 00:33:14.419]  Here it is, right here.
[00:33:16.201 --> 00:33:18.503]  I think the puppet on the right shares my beliefs.
[00:33:18.883 --> 00:33:21.406]  I think the puppet on the left is more to my liking.
[00:33:23.584 --> 00:33:24.145]  Hey, wait a minute!
[00:33:24.185 --> 00:33:26.026]  There's one guy holding up both puppets!
[00:33:26.066 --> 00:33:26.527]  Shut up!
[00:33:27.308 --> 00:33:28.709]  Go back to bed, America.
[00:33:28.729 --> 00:33:30.230]  Your government is in control.
[00:33:32.272 --> 00:33:36.416]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:33:37.177 --> 00:33:38.638]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:44.383 --> 00:33:47.967]  You know, I was thinking...
[00:33:49.298 --> 00:34:15.362]  Well, I was reading comments on InfoWars.com and on YouTube, on videos from the show the last few days of all these top geopolitical experts, people involved in disarmament deals with the Soviets like Dr. Roberts, high-level Reagan administration, people like Dr. Jerome Corsi, who's done international relations as well, about the danger of nuclear war.
[00:34:17.523 --> 00:34:23.727]  Now they've got top British ministers saying the same thing that are conservative, understanding how serious this is.
[00:34:25.348 --> 00:34:27.890]  Russia and China saying they'll go to war with NATO.
[00:34:30.171 --> 00:34:35.755]  After our governments and defense contractors have sold them all our latest technology, that's a really good idea.
[00:34:36.135 --> 00:34:42.319]  I mean, even if you're evil and want to start World War III, don't do it with somebody that is going to absolutely, probably destroy the world.
[00:34:43.851 --> 00:34:48.252]  We will be lucky if it doesn't kill all life on land and most stuff in the ocean.
[00:34:48.632 --> 00:34:53.553]  Many analysts have broken down with a full scale, total commitment, 40,000 nuclear weapons going off.
[00:34:53.573 --> 00:34:55.674]  And that's just the big ones.
[00:34:57.114 --> 00:34:59.195]  And then all the super weapons getting drug out.
[00:34:59.635 --> 00:35:01.395]  I mean, it is not a good idea.
[00:35:01.435 --> 00:35:02.815]  And I see these yuppies.
[00:35:03.696 --> 00:35:04.756]  I would go over this morning.
[00:35:04.796 --> 00:35:05.956]  I woke up at about 3 a.m.
[00:35:05.996 --> 00:35:06.556]  I couldn't sleep.
[00:35:06.576 --> 00:35:09.417]  I've been so concerned about all this.
[00:35:10.424 --> 00:35:15.528]  And I'm somebody who's always been able to sleep like a dead king, you know, just never getting up again, basically.
[00:35:15.988 --> 00:35:19.451]  Firecrackers can be going off outside, helicopters, whatever, I don't get up.
[00:35:20.312 --> 00:35:23.314]  And I woke up at about 3.30 and couldn't go back to bed.
[00:35:23.334 --> 00:35:29.098]  So I guess right now it's kind of like the evening for me, but I'll be up till late tonight working.
[00:35:30.259 --> 00:35:33.722]  And I was just thinking about how much danger society is.
[00:35:33.802 --> 00:35:36.084]  I'm going in and looking at my children asleep in bed.
[00:35:37.725 --> 00:35:41.488]  The lab was sitting there on the couch looking at me wondering why I was walking around and waking it up.
[00:35:43.529 --> 00:35:45.330]  And then I went at about 5 a.m.
[00:35:45.370 --> 00:35:51.754]  and said I can't go back to sleep and started reading news and I saw the people on YouTube and I would go to their websites and they were real people.
[00:35:52.655 --> 00:35:56.618]  They were concerned about Miley Cyrus or concerned about whatever the latest hype was.
[00:35:58.799 --> 00:36:03.222]  I would go to their YouTube channel to see if they were a real person and not a sock puppet.
[00:36:03.262 --> 00:36:03.903]  Sometimes they are.
[00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:16.605]  A government or corporate person there to distract and basically sow dissension as the Pentagon and CIA admits they're doing domestically now under Obama's orders.
[00:36:16.625 --> 00:36:17.465]  That's all public now.
[00:36:19.706 --> 00:36:20.707]  And they were real people.
[00:36:22.087 --> 00:36:26.990]  Commenting on petty things, obsessed with being stupid, obsessed with not caring.
[00:36:27.370 --> 00:36:32.012]  Kind of that attitude, that spirit of nihilistic foolishness.
[00:36:34.088 --> 00:36:37.030]  Of eat, drink, and be morons for tomorrow we die.
[00:36:37.310 --> 00:36:39.932]  But a nihilist knows tomorrow we die, at least.
[00:36:39.972 --> 00:36:41.333]  These are beyond nihilists.
[00:36:41.633 --> 00:36:48.317]  They worship at the altar of being ignorant and then attacking and laughing at those that are informed, intelligent, and virtuous.
[00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:53.533]  And I realize they are jealous inherently of serious people.
[00:36:54.254 --> 00:36:57.918]  They are jealous inherently of people that care and want to make the world a better place.
[00:36:58.499 --> 00:36:59.059]  That's really what it is.
[00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:12.674]  And of course, 96, 97% of people were upvoting the videos, but I just use it as a sociological study of the people that were making jokes about it, going, you know, you idiots, there's not going to be any nuclear war.
[00:37:14.053 --> 00:37:17.756]  You know, go in your basement and do this and that to yourself.
[00:37:17.776 --> 00:37:19.577]  Ah ha ha, you morons!
[00:37:20.338 --> 00:37:21.279]  There's no threat.
[00:37:21.539 --> 00:37:30.406]  Well, let me tell you, there's a threat to the people in Syria, the estimated 200 plus thousand, most of them civilians, killed by Al Qaeda.
[00:37:30.766 --> 00:37:43.696]  The little kids murdered in front of their parents, the dads made a suicide bomb or their whole family's killed, the church is blown up, the Coptic priest, the Catholic priest being murdered, the burning cities,
[00:37:44.936 --> 00:37:52.460]  It's kind of like if your neighbors got a bankruptcy, out of work, having their house repossessed, it's a recession.
[00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:54.181]  But if it's happening to you, it's a depression.
[00:37:54.881 --> 00:37:58.623]  This is a real thing happening over there, and they're making jokes about that.
[00:38:01.104 --> 00:38:03.325]  And they make jokes about videos showing dead kids.
[00:38:04.606 --> 00:38:05.386]  And they think it's funny.
[00:38:06.987 --> 00:38:10.849]  And then they make jokes about all these experts we have on saying this could spur World War III.
[00:38:11.289 --> 00:38:12.490]  They think it's funny.
[00:38:15.117 --> 00:38:18.821]  We barely have stopped World War III at least three times on record.
[00:38:19.001 --> 00:38:26.529]  The most famous, of course, is the Cuban Missile Crisis, where it came within minutes of both sides blasting each other off the map.
[00:38:31.354 --> 00:38:31.474]  And
[00:38:33.427 --> 00:38:40.730]  There are all sorts of genetic engineering, open-air projects with crops that are already causing horrible degenerative diseases in the human population.
[00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:43.811]  The cancer rates are already up, on average, over 3,000%.
[00:38:44.432 --> 00:38:45.972]  Pediatric, on average, over 10,000%.
[00:38:46.373 --> 00:38:50.154]  Some are up hundreds of thousands percentage, because they didn't exist before.
[00:38:50.174 --> 00:38:51.655]  I mean, go look at the numbers.
[00:38:51.855 --> 00:38:52.895]  We're already in a crisis.
[00:38:53.115 --> 00:38:55.777]  And I realized, I had this epiphany at 5 a.m.
[00:38:57.777 --> 00:38:58.898]  sitting there reading all this.
[00:39:00.811 --> 00:39:02.933]  That it's like mass mental illness.
[00:39:02.973 --> 00:39:04.735]  The elite have what these people have.
[00:39:05.897 --> 00:39:11.242]  They don't think there's any genetic engineering with all these gene guns creating thousands of new mutations a day all over the world.
[00:39:11.663 --> 00:39:16.088]  They don't think... They don't think any of that is a danger.
[00:39:19.873 --> 00:39:25.457]  They don't think that fluoride in the water is bad, even though there's all the Harvard studies showing it's brain damaging and giving them cancer.
[00:39:25.918 --> 00:39:28.620]  They don't care about the IQs physically dropping.
[00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:29.801]  It's not just education.
[00:39:29.821 --> 00:39:30.341]  We're dumber.
[00:39:30.361 --> 00:39:30.881]  We're poisoned.
[00:39:31.342 --> 00:39:34.464]  They don't care about forced abortion all over the world under the UN.
[00:39:34.784 --> 00:39:39.168]  They don't care about eugenics and forced sterilization going on all over the US, on record, currently.
[00:39:40.489 --> 00:39:42.290]  They don't care if their neighbor gets tasered to death.
[00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:44.091]  They don't care if Detroit goes bankrupt.
[00:39:44.291 --> 00:39:45.951]  They don't care if some company goes under.
[00:39:45.971 --> 00:39:47.452]  They always go, well, why do I care?
[00:39:47.772 --> 00:39:50.273]  I don't work there because it affects you, moron!
[00:39:50.674 --> 00:39:51.814]  We're all interconnected.
[00:39:52.775 --> 00:39:54.535]  These people just don't get it.
[00:39:54.595 --> 00:39:57.877]  They're totally disconnected from reality.
[00:39:58.257 --> 00:40:01.759]  And then we're here trying to stop World War III as best we can.
[00:40:01.999 --> 00:40:03.359]  Not because we want to be heroes.
[00:40:03.659 --> 00:40:04.680]  We want to have a future.
[00:40:06.288 --> 00:40:09.030]  Because they also go, oh, the heroes are going to save us from World War III.
[00:40:09.070 --> 00:40:11.572]  You jerks are always saying there's going to be doom and gloom.
[00:40:11.953 --> 00:40:13.013]  No, we've got hope.
[00:40:13.314 --> 00:40:14.895]  The world loves their grandchildren.
[00:40:15.936 --> 00:40:21.841]  Many generals in NATO, in our military, are speaking out and getting in trouble for it, saying this is a horrible idea.
[00:40:21.861 --> 00:40:22.982]  It could cause World War III.
[00:40:24.414 --> 00:40:39.722]  People that really know how things work are very concerned and to sit there and watch you people make jokes when they could extinct this planet is absolutely outrageous on so many fronts it makes my head spin.
[00:40:42.284 --> 00:40:52.930]  That there are so many serious threats incrementally to the species with the soft kill systems, with the ambient background tyranny and police state being turned up, but all of that even pales
[00:40:53.942 --> 00:41:01.125]  With the thermonuclear threat, the genetic engineering threat, all of this stuff that's already causing incredible problems.
[00:41:01.185 --> 00:41:06.528]  But because the media doesn't make a big issue out of it, the sheep will tend to think it's all funny.
[00:41:06.768 --> 00:41:09.729]  Or even if the media does cover it, they still just laugh at it.
[00:41:10.530 --> 00:41:12.091]  Until they get diagnosed at 25 with cancer.
[00:41:13.385 --> 00:41:18.089]  Until their 18-year-old girlfriend gets diagnosed with stomach cancer or brain cancer.
[00:41:18.469 --> 00:41:24.594]  I mean, everybody I know has young people in their family dying right now of cancers that were unknown 50 years ago.
[00:41:25.374 --> 00:41:27.216]  And I know exactly where most of them came from.
[00:41:27.636 --> 00:41:35.442]  SV40 that's in most of the vaccines, a bio-weapon virus they developed back in the 50s, and it's the old reliable.
[00:41:36.533 --> 00:41:40.137]  Taken out of cancer patients, out of immortal cell lines.
[00:41:40.557 --> 00:41:44.341]  Zombies and people aren't real, but individual cells can be literal zombies.
[00:41:44.801 --> 00:41:46.863]  You cannot kill them except with fire.
[00:41:48.204 --> 00:41:50.727]  And they inject that into all of us, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:41:52.088 --> 00:41:55.071]  I mean, I am sitting here, look up immortal cell lines if you think I'm joking.
[00:41:55.511 --> 00:41:59.896]  This is the type of stuff that they're doing, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:05.693]  He's combining viruses then with apes and then injecting it back into us.
[00:42:06.253 --> 00:42:09.515]  It is unspeakable what's already going on.
[00:42:09.535 --> 00:42:16.840]  But even the globalists that are a bunch of lovers of death understand the hot fire will consume them.
[00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:18.742]  They're not going to get out of what they're going to do.
[00:42:18.762 --> 00:42:19.962]  They're not going to escape it.
[00:42:20.883 --> 00:42:22.364]  They're not going to get out of this.
[00:42:23.365 --> 00:42:26.127]  They say God destroyed the earth with water, the next time will be with fire.
[00:42:27.315 --> 00:42:29.656]  Will God let our own evil rulers do it to us?
[00:42:30.376 --> 00:42:31.437]  As the hand of judgment?
[00:42:31.557 --> 00:42:32.157]  I don't know.
[00:42:32.477 --> 00:42:35.579]  But I know this, I'm gonna work to stop it.
[00:42:36.259 --> 00:42:38.100]  And to warn people about what's happening.
[00:42:40.281 --> 00:42:44.582]  But it is sheer madness that this spirit of not caring.
[00:42:44.922 --> 00:42:50.445]  Used to, if a reactor was melting down or leaking, they would freak out, fix it, it'd be a big deal.
[00:42:51.144 --> 00:42:53.286]  Now 91% of reactors look it up.
[00:42:54.307 --> 00:43:03.455]  International Atomic Energy Agency admits 91% of the 400 plus reactors are leaking deadly uranium and plutonium and other byproducts all over the world.
[00:43:04.156 --> 00:43:04.956]  They just don't care now.
[00:43:05.257 --> 00:43:06.338]  They've now all over the U.S.
[00:43:06.378 --> 00:43:11.202]  turned the big alarms off because it scares populated areas when they off gas radiation.
[00:43:11.442 --> 00:43:13.824]  They used to by federal law have alarms.
[00:43:16.271 --> 00:43:17.372]  Bring it to safe zone!
[00:43:17.612 --> 00:43:18.472]  Radiation leak!
[00:43:18.692 --> 00:43:19.472]  Radiation leak!
[00:43:19.653 --> 00:43:20.613]  They've turned them off now.
[00:43:20.713 --> 00:43:21.193]  Look that up.
[00:43:24.495 --> 00:43:28.817]  Now they've admitted that Fukushima's been leaking the whole time, worse than they told the public.
[00:43:29.077 --> 00:43:30.097]  That's out in the news today.
[00:43:30.117 --> 00:43:32.178]  And people joke.
[00:43:32.198 --> 00:43:34.439]  They go, oh, you ought to be thankful for the radiation.
[00:43:34.619 --> 00:43:36.100]  Oh, it's no big deal.
[00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:37.661]  Oh, it's healthy for you.
[00:43:37.941 --> 00:43:39.662]  The Japanese government, smile!
[00:43:39.742 --> 00:43:40.742]  It'll make it not hurt you.
[00:43:40.982 --> 00:43:42.623]  I mean, I'm not joking if you're a new listener.
[00:43:42.663 --> 00:43:44.264]  We played that video last week.
[00:43:45.822 --> 00:43:57.283]  And I realize these are people who are so self-centered and so nihilistic that then once you're like that, you don't care about anybody anymore and you...
[00:43:58.257 --> 00:44:07.465]  You don't have a feeling of community and kinship with your ancestors and with your current family and your children and then with those to come.
[00:44:07.765 --> 00:44:09.227]  That feeling of humanity.
[00:44:09.347 --> 00:44:10.047]  I'm gonna die.
[00:44:10.408 --> 00:44:13.110]  I won't always be here, but my great-great-grandchildren will.
[00:44:13.370 --> 00:44:13.771]  Wow!
[00:44:14.151 --> 00:44:15.552]  Imagine what they'll see and do.
[00:44:15.873 --> 00:44:16.693]  And I love them.
[00:44:17.194 --> 00:44:18.215]  I want them to exist.
[00:44:19.885 --> 00:44:22.447]  I have this shared connection to the past, the present, and the future.
[00:44:22.708 --> 00:44:25.770]  My humanity, my spirit, cries out against this.
[00:44:26.551 --> 00:44:28.452]  The butchering of the genetic code of the planet.
[00:44:28.773 --> 00:44:30.694]  The vandalization of the human genome.
[00:44:31.135 --> 00:44:32.155]  All the horrible things.
[00:44:32.235 --> 00:44:34.878]  DARPA coming out with an extra chromosome in humans.
[00:44:35.498 --> 00:44:40.342]  And they're already mixing humans with animals so they can say they don't have rights and then harvest their organs.
[00:44:40.362 --> 00:44:42.244]  So technically there's no human clones.
[00:44:42.264 --> 00:44:45.186]  They've just had human-animal clones for 25 years.
[00:44:45.586 --> 00:44:46.807]  And oh by the way, we didn't tell you.
[00:44:47.748 --> 00:44:55.814]  I mean, we're in a Buck Rogers science fiction crazy land, and then I'll get pulled over by some young rookie cop.
[00:44:56.214 --> 00:44:57.755]  Come over, you were going 10 miles over.
[00:44:57.996 --> 00:44:58.696]  What's in the car?
[00:44:58.736 --> 00:44:59.477]  You do drugs?
[00:45:00.455 --> 00:45:02.515]  How you doing, Alex?
[00:45:02.916 --> 00:45:03.936]  You're kind of a kook.
[00:45:04.676 --> 00:45:05.496]  Yeah, I'm kind of a kook.
[00:45:05.756 --> 00:45:06.857]  I know all his programming.
[00:45:07.177 --> 00:45:09.257]  I know his whole mindset.
[00:45:09.577 --> 00:45:11.278]  I know everything he's going to basically say.
[00:45:11.578 --> 00:45:12.798]  He'll never really develop.
[00:45:13.078 --> 00:45:17.339]  He's on a power trip with petty power that someone with real power would be ashamed to abuse.
[00:45:18.699 --> 00:45:22.700]  And meanwhile, I know he's being injected with bioweapons when he gets vaccines.
[00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:23.740]  So is his whole family.
[00:45:24.021 --> 00:45:25.741]  I care about him, but I can't help him.
[00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:27.280]  He's gone.
[00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:28.061]  He's on a power trip.
[00:45:28.101 --> 00:45:28.681]  It's over for him.
[00:45:29.081 --> 00:45:32.743]  You know, it just comes to the point of Rachel Maddow.
[00:45:32.823 --> 00:45:33.344]  I don't hate.
[00:45:34.324 --> 00:45:34.985]  I don't hate her.
[00:45:35.325 --> 00:45:43.509]  I just know she's some narcissistic, power-tripping person up there that's part of the whole fake reality they project to keep people from ever realizing what's really going on.
[00:45:46.971 --> 00:45:52.975]  But in all of this, in the horrible news, that until 1990 they wouldn't let troops use DU,
[00:45:54.684 --> 00:45:55.545]  But they did after.
[00:45:55.725 --> 00:45:57.026]  And why do I mention that every week?
[00:45:57.587 --> 00:46:01.991]  Because every Pentagon report by their scientists said this will kill whoever uses it.
[00:46:02.211 --> 00:46:05.955]  It ignites in the barrel, you breathe it, it'll take decades off your life.
[00:46:06.375 --> 00:46:11.400]  Anytime you use this, this will kill most people that are around it by their fifties.
[00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:15.564]  They're going to have failed kidneys, where it precipitates out, lung cancer.
[00:46:15.965 --> 00:46:16.905]  Do not use this.
[00:46:17.306 --> 00:46:19.288]  And they said, okay, let us have it deployed.
[00:46:19.888 --> 00:46:28.559]  On the Eastern Front, in case the Russians ever 10 to 1 superiority pour across, so our troops will have super bullets in their 50 cals and stuff to take out tanks.
[00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:31.603]  And the scientists said, don't even do that, it's mission creep.
[00:46:31.984 --> 00:46:33.906]  Sure enough, it was deployed by the 70s.
[00:46:35.563 --> 00:46:36.704]  In Europe, never used.
[00:46:37.085 --> 00:46:38.506]  Couldn't even use it on shooting ranges.
[00:46:39.127 --> 00:46:40.648]  Now it's used on shooting ranges everywhere.
[00:46:40.888 --> 00:46:42.130]  Now there's... Just don't worry about it.
[00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:44.011]  Don't even wear a mask when you use DU, boys.
[00:46:44.412 --> 00:46:45.473]  Don't even wash your face.
[00:46:45.993 --> 00:46:47.835]  I mean, it's a death sentence.
[00:46:48.075 --> 00:46:48.736]  That's the same thing.
[00:46:49.076 --> 00:46:51.319]  Oh, Alex, genetic engineering's not gonna hurt us.
[00:46:51.719 --> 00:46:54.061]  Oh, there's not gonna be a nuclear war ever.
[00:46:56.804 --> 00:46:59.487]  I mean, it's this attitude of maniacs!
[00:47:01.072 --> 00:47:06.303]  And then you go to the airport and there's some, you know, minimum, well, they're not minimum wage, they're like 50, 60 grand a year or whatever.
[00:47:07.165 --> 00:47:11.308]  Power-tripping person who couldn't get a minimum wage job, acting like you're a terrorist.
[00:47:11.648 --> 00:47:14.209]  They've had some eight-hour course where they can read your mind.
[00:47:14.249 --> 00:47:15.730]  They can't even read the back of a cereal box.
[00:47:16.731 --> 00:47:19.012]  Staring at you on an imperious power trip.
[00:47:19.252 --> 00:47:20.513]  And it's just a stupid victim.
[00:47:21.093 --> 00:47:21.894]  And you want to warn them.
[00:47:21.914 --> 00:47:22.494]  So now I do.
[00:47:22.554 --> 00:47:24.255]  I go, the government's staged 9-11.
[00:47:24.395 --> 00:47:25.096]  This is all a fraud.
[00:47:25.116 --> 00:47:26.857]  The government ships in all the narcotics.
[00:47:26.877 --> 00:47:27.958]  And they go, please search.
[00:47:28.638 --> 00:47:29.439]  No scanner for you.
[00:47:29.459 --> 00:47:30.179]  Go on through.
[00:47:30.199 --> 00:47:32.420]  Because then suddenly, the power trip's over.
[00:47:32.580 --> 00:47:33.421]  The game's over.
[00:47:33.701 --> 00:47:34.822]  The wake-up call is there.
[00:47:36.459 --> 00:47:51.131]  I mean, I cannot sit there while cops go around acting like there's terrorists everywhere, and the TSA wants to stick their hands down my wife's pants, or my children's for that matter, so I can't fly anywhere with my family while the government runs Al-Qaeda!
[00:47:51.451 --> 00:47:53.353]  I mean, it makes me want to throw up!
[00:47:54.153 --> 00:47:55.394]  They think we're so stupid?
[00:47:55.614 --> 00:48:01.980]  They have chemical attacks in front of us and uploaded to known jihadi YouTubes that have been up for years?
[00:48:02.992 --> 00:48:07.757]  Holla, holla, holla, all that stuff, Obi-Wan, firing them at the Syrian troops.
[00:48:08.257 --> 00:48:10.139]  And then our government goes, it doesn't matter if that's out.
[00:48:10.339 --> 00:48:11.280]  We'll just go with it.
[00:48:11.420 --> 00:48:12.401]  We control the press.
[00:48:12.581 --> 00:48:13.222]  They won't report it.
[00:48:13.382 --> 00:48:15.424]  We'll just ignore InfoWars.com.
[00:48:15.704 --> 00:48:17.626]  We'll just ignore WorldNetDaily.com.
[00:48:17.806 --> 00:48:19.668]  We'll just ignore DrugsReport.com.
[00:48:19.828 --> 00:48:22.470]  We'll just ignore anybody that covers this.
[00:48:22.791 --> 00:48:25.994]  They don't even care that everybody... But here's the good news.
[00:48:29.404 --> 00:48:30.164]  91% in a major poll.
[00:48:30.184 --> 00:48:31.345]  There's a bunch of others coming out.
[00:48:31.525 --> 00:48:34.227]  None of the polls have more than 15% support here in the U.S.
[00:48:34.767 --> 00:48:35.647]  for this atrocity.
[00:48:35.948 --> 00:48:37.909]  You have lost even the sheeple.
[00:48:38.749 --> 00:48:44.873]  And so, with all this bad news and scary news, everybody deep down understands we're all in danger.
[00:48:44.913 --> 00:48:45.653]  Everybody can feel it.
[00:48:45.813 --> 00:48:48.615]  If you've got any guts, any spirit, any discernment.
[00:48:48.635 --> 00:48:51.216]  If you're not a complete selfish moron.
[00:48:51.236 --> 00:48:53.518]  When you're selfish, folks, you lose your soul.
[00:48:55.277 --> 00:48:58.219]  And by lose your soul, it starts shrinking, it starts dying.
[00:48:58.419 --> 00:49:01.881]  Your shadow gets taller than your soul, to use the old English saying.
[00:49:02.261 --> 00:49:07.884]  Where you shrink in and become more and more self-centered and mindless like Gollum.
[00:49:08.525 --> 00:49:11.967]  Until you don't care about anything but your own little mental illness.
[00:49:12.647 --> 00:49:18.090]  But when you start caring about others, that's when your mind opens up because now you are a human.
[00:49:19.554 --> 00:49:21.675]  And they don't ever want you to get to that point.
[00:49:22.036 --> 00:49:27.319]  That's why they want you dependent, unhappy, plugged into your television set, being brain damaged by the globalists.
[00:49:30.241 --> 00:49:32.202]  Now I haven't even gotten to the huge stack of news yet.
[00:49:32.222 --> 00:49:33.083]  I'll do it after the break.
[00:49:33.283 --> 00:49:35.905]  But I want to go out to break with last year.
[00:49:37.369 --> 00:49:43.532]  The House and Senate both had these hearings saying to the Secretary of Defense Panetta, you have to get approval to attack a Syrian.
[00:49:43.552 --> 00:49:44.893]  They said we're not going to get it from you.
[00:49:44.913 --> 00:49:47.754]  Well now Congress is saying you will get it or we're going to impeach.
[00:49:48.095 --> 00:49:49.095]  Let's go ahead and play that clip.
[00:49:49.255 --> 00:49:58.380]  You know again, our goal would be to seek international permission and we would come to the Congress and inform you.
[00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:06.404]  Uh, and determine, uh, how best to approach this, uh, whether or not we would, uh, want to get, uh, permission from the Congress.
[00:50:06.604 --> 00:50:10.446]  Uh, I think those are issues we have to discuss as we decide what to do here.
[00:50:11.232 --> 00:50:14.335]  Well, I'm almost breathless about that.
[00:50:14.375 --> 00:50:15.116]  That's a coup right there.
[00:50:15.136 --> 00:50:22.863]  Because what I heard you say is, we're going to seek international approval, and they will come and tell the Congress what we might do.
[00:50:23.043 --> 00:50:25.125]  And we might seek congressional approval.
[00:50:25.145 --> 00:50:26.126]  They should be arrested right on the spot.
[00:50:26.146 --> 00:50:28.088]  Well, let me just say to you, that's a big dish.
[00:50:28.188 --> 00:50:28.809]  Wouldn't you agree?
[00:50:29.469 --> 00:50:30.690]  You've served in the Congress.
[00:50:30.851 --> 00:50:31.651]  And then he doesn't agree.
[00:50:31.671 --> 00:50:32.632]  Wouldn't you agree that that's...
[00:50:33.914 --> 00:50:38.658]  Would be pretty breathtaking to the average American, so would you like to clarify that?
[00:50:38.678 --> 00:50:50.069]  But I've also served with Republican presidents and Democratic presidents who have always reserved the right to defend this country if necessary.
[00:50:53.612 --> 00:50:57.716]  But before we do this, you would seek permission of the international authorities?
[00:50:57.736 --> 00:50:58.136]  And he says no!
[00:50:59.938 --> 00:51:03.789]  If we're working with an international coalition, we're working with NATO.
[00:51:03.969 --> 00:51:04.390]  You hear that?
[00:51:04.450 --> 00:51:07.278]  They say they get their orders from NATO, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:51:09.827 --> 00:51:11.268]  Chef 5-Minute Meals.
[00:51:11.408 --> 00:51:13.729]  The complete, self-contained, bug-out meal.

[00:51:22.953 --> 00:51:26.234]  Perfect for disasters or distress, yet great for every day.
[00:51:26.374 --> 00:51:28.955]  Shelf-stable for 5 years without refrigeration.

[00:54:15.894 --> 00:54:20.936]  Syrian Prime Minister warns country will become a graveyard for invaders.
[00:54:21.076 --> 00:54:24.237]  Does Obama know he's hiding on Al-Qaeda's side?
[00:54:24.437 --> 00:54:27.078]  Asks one of the top British newspapers, The Independent.
[00:54:27.698 --> 00:54:32.800]  Strikes likely to trigger terrorist attacks against the United States, says Israel.
[00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:39.262]  Then they can take more of our rights, see how the false flag works, and divert from all of Obama's scandals?
[00:54:40.582 --> 00:54:42.983]  Israel calls up reservists after threats.
[00:54:43.163 --> 00:54:43.603]  Report.
[00:54:44.344 --> 00:54:44.764]  Calls.
[00:54:46.201 --> 00:54:50.003]  Intercepts proof that nerve gas was used.
[00:54:50.043 --> 00:54:51.703]  Yeah, well, we know nerve gas was used.
[00:54:51.723 --> 00:54:52.544]  We know the rebels did it.
[00:54:52.904 --> 00:54:55.285]  That's why they say it doesn't matter who did it.
[00:54:55.305 --> 00:54:57.406]  They need to invade now because of nerve gas.
[00:54:57.746 --> 00:54:58.966]  Jordan says they won't help.
[00:54:59.006 --> 00:54:59.627]  They already are.
[00:55:00.327 --> 00:55:06.810]  Also, Al-Qaeda-linked group behind Benghazi trains jihadists for Syria.
[00:55:06.830 --> 00:55:09.811]  UN says wait four days.
[00:55:10.131 --> 00:55:12.232]  And again, I'm a big critic of the United Nations.
[00:55:12.292 --> 00:55:14.833]  It's mainly a puppet organization of the globalists.
[00:55:15.663 --> 00:55:21.126]  But it's funny how Obama says he can attack people because of UN approval, even if Congress doesn't.
[00:55:21.426 --> 00:55:27.970]  But then when the UN gets vetoed by Russia and China on the Security Council, well now we don't need them either.
[00:55:28.250 --> 00:55:31.252]  We don't need Congress, who's really got the authority, and we don't need the UN.
[00:55:33.154 --> 00:55:34.095]  And then what is NATO?
[00:55:34.135 --> 00:55:36.196]  It's just a treaty organization of the militaries.
[00:55:36.536 --> 00:55:40.339]  The militaries are saying they'll do what they want with the executives over them.
[00:55:41.039 --> 00:55:42.280]  And who set up NATO?
[00:55:42.580 --> 00:55:43.601]  It's Bilderberg, folks.
[00:55:44.301 --> 00:55:48.123]  Bilderberg, we're being told, runs our military.
[00:55:48.504 --> 00:55:56.649]  This is the globalist coup, with the generals arrogantly staring down members of Congress and Panetta, extremely arrogant.
[00:55:58.177 --> 00:56:01.140]  Saying, you know, we attack who we want without approval.
[00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:06.925]  And what he's saying is, like, missiles are fired, Congress has already approved to shoot them down and respond.
[00:56:07.646 --> 00:56:19.077]  That's what they talk about, you're going back to Plan R and things, back in the 60s, which could have been abused by rogue generals, like Curtis LeMay that wanted to nuke Russia without approval in 1962.
[00:56:21.357 --> 00:56:33.120]  So this is the type of issue that we're dealing with and now they're back again saying we'll attack without congressional approval and you've got, here's the articles, up on InfoWars.com.
[00:56:33.460 --> 00:56:36.721]  Obama ignores Congress on approval for Syria attack.
[00:56:37.441 --> 00:56:41.722]  56 bipartisan House members demand President follow Constitution.
[00:56:43.363 --> 00:56:47.944]  Congressman Amash has Syria strike unquestionably unconstitutional without congressional approval.
[00:56:48.934 --> 00:56:49.555]  Absolutely.
[00:56:49.635 --> 00:56:54.778]  I mean, we don't need a congressman to tell us that, or the ACLU to tell us warrantless wiretapping is illegal either.
[00:56:55.639 --> 00:57:09.128]  Glenn Beck has come out and said this could cause World War III, we need to have anti-war rallies to push back against this, and people need to just ignore politicians like John McCain and President Obama dismissing opposition to intervention as coming from extremists.
[00:57:09.409 --> 00:57:09.889]  That's a quote.
[00:57:09.929 --> 00:57:11.070]  Well, good job, Glenn Beck.
[00:57:13.732 --> 00:57:14.132]  That's good.
[00:57:15.133 --> 00:57:16.494]  None of us want our kids dead, do we?
[00:57:18.124 --> 00:57:21.447]  You're probably rich enough to actually have a good enough bunker to go live in, but I don't.
[00:57:21.968 --> 00:57:24.770]  Okay, as Jawahiri to Syrian rebels.
[00:57:25.091 --> 00:57:27.012]  Damascus first, then Cairo, then Jerusalem.
[00:57:27.092 --> 00:57:29.274]  Hails the Al-Qaeda invasion.
[00:57:30.796 --> 00:57:34.519]  That our government, John Baum made the point during the break, he goes, this will be like U.S.
[00:57:34.539 --> 00:57:38.143]  World War II soldiers fighting on the side of the Nazis against a country.
[00:57:39.104 --> 00:57:41.025]  That's what our military's doing covertly with this.
[00:57:41.386 --> 00:57:42.507]  It is unspeakable.
[00:57:44.563 --> 00:57:46.205]  Continuing, here's one independent I mentioned.
[00:57:46.485 --> 00:57:50.128]  Does Obama know he's fighting on Al Qaeda's side?
[00:57:51.369 --> 00:57:58.056]  All for one and one for all should be the battle cry, the West goes to war against Assad's Syrian regime.
[00:57:59.821 --> 00:58:04.602]  Al-Qaeda vows volcano of revenge over Syrian suspected gas attack.
[00:58:04.722 --> 00:58:05.362]  Indian news.
[00:58:05.522 --> 00:58:07.083]  Oh yeah, Al-Qaeda launched that attack.
[00:58:07.563 --> 00:58:10.163]  Attack on Syria likely to trigger terrorist acts in the US.
[00:58:10.223 --> 00:58:10.543]  Israel.
[00:58:10.583 --> 00:58:11.324]  Washington Times.
[00:58:12.064 --> 00:58:16.105]  Israeli intelligence intercepted Syrian regime talk about chemical attack.
[00:58:16.365 --> 00:58:20.506]  Yeah, and when you read the intercepts that they've put out the audio for, it's like, did you do this?
[00:58:20.706 --> 00:58:21.286]  What's going on?
[00:58:21.346 --> 00:58:22.106]  We didn't order this!
[00:58:22.759 --> 00:58:24.180]  Which is the proof they weren't behind it.
[00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:28.221]  I mean, they got battle chatter from the top general saying that proves they didn't.
[00:58:28.661 --> 00:58:31.422]  Then we'll get into the economic effects of all this.
[00:58:31.462 --> 00:58:37.225]  The Syrian conflict could spill over into Iraq, and Brent oil could surge $150 a barrel.
[00:58:37.985 --> 00:58:47.449]  That's just some of what's coming up in the second hour, and we'll look at the latest power grab, while we're all diverted with this, by the Greenie Weenies with their Global Taxi Waxes.
[00:58:52.199 --> 00:58:56.176]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:07.467]  Dozens of diseases ranging from the common cold and flu to MRSA and pneumonia are all caused by infectious pathogens.
[00:59:07.927 --> 00:59:11.711]  Fortunately, a simple, safe and effective alternative exists.
[00:59:12.171 --> 00:59:25.724]  Supernatural Silver is a new and vastly improved type of silver solution that is safe and extremely effective against 143 types of bacteria, both forms of viruses, mold and yeast, and a limited number of parasites.
[00:59:26.264 --> 00:59:28.225]  It can even purify water!
[00:59:28.746 --> 00:59:33.428]  Supernatural Silver comes in both liquid and gel for internal or external use.

[01:00:02.469 --> 01:00:04.391]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:04.851 --> 01:00:07.594]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:14.246 --> 01:00:18.450]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:19.091 --> 01:00:19.891]  You want answers?
[01:00:20.672 --> 01:00:21.633]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:22.214 --> 01:00:25.797]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:26.417 --> 01:00:30.521]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:48.163 --> 01:00:53.108]  Alright folks, we got Martin Moreno popping in for about 20 minutes on the latest.
[01:00:53.949 --> 01:00:58.735]  The head of Climate Depot on CNN saying polar bears are all dying when the opposite is true.
[01:00:58.795 --> 01:01:04.321]  And Al Gore running around saying there's a sixth level to hurricanes and that's not true.
[01:01:04.381 --> 01:01:08.205]  I mean it is just, these people are congenital liars.
[01:01:09.306 --> 01:01:09.987]  Pathological.
[01:01:11.806 --> 01:01:13.467]  And I guess it works for the gullible public.
[01:01:13.527 --> 01:01:14.287]  It does whatever they're told.
[01:01:14.327 --> 01:01:17.969]  But the good news is, if you just joined us, all these polls are out.
[01:01:18.069 --> 01:01:24.871]  Between 9 and 15 percent of the American people support Obama launching wars.
[01:01:26.012 --> 01:01:27.212]  And I was looking at polls.
[01:01:27.713 --> 01:01:29.493]  It's hardcore Democrats.
[01:01:29.673 --> 01:01:30.874]  It's upwards of 30 percent.
[01:01:30.894 --> 01:01:34.435]  So that's the only reason you get 9 to 15, depending on the poll as an average.
[01:01:34.875 --> 01:01:36.096]  So they would do anything.
[01:01:36.416 --> 01:01:39.117]  In fact, we sent out our reporters yesterday.
[01:01:39.137 --> 01:01:40.658]  We're going to air this on the nightly news tonight.
[01:01:42.355 --> 01:01:47.719]  Yesterday, and had him say, we need to ban brown bags in Austin, Texas.
[01:01:48.199 --> 01:01:49.260]  Because Seattle did.
[01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:50.661]  The word brown bag is racist.
[01:01:51.141 --> 01:01:52.102]  And the people signed it.
[01:01:53.623 --> 01:01:54.643]  Because brown bag is racist.
[01:01:54.663 --> 01:01:56.444]  They said, also we want to ban the family.
[01:01:56.985 --> 01:01:59.226]  Because it might hurt people that don't have families.
[01:02:01.268 --> 01:02:02.629]  And they said, absolutely.
[01:02:02.649 --> 01:02:03.749]  Ban the family immediately.
[01:02:04.810 --> 01:02:06.031]  These are authoritarians.
[01:02:06.071 --> 01:02:07.312]  These are not even people.
[01:02:08.143 --> 01:02:13.185]  I mean, they are literally gibbering idiots who just worship government.
[01:02:13.265 --> 01:02:17.206]  I mean, it is their mommy, it is their daddy, like that peon.
[01:02:18.086 --> 01:02:19.406]  Jackass, excuse me.
[01:02:19.926 --> 01:02:21.827]  I mean, just moron.
[01:02:24.488 --> 01:02:24.968]  Chris Rock.
[01:02:27.199 --> 01:02:33.562]  And that's the reason he's funny, is because he comes off in like a mean way, like it's mean to make fun of a mentally retarded child.
[01:02:33.622 --> 01:02:34.422]  I think it's very sad.
[01:02:34.442 --> 01:02:38.864]  A lot of them are very sweet, but with Chris Rock, I mean, you know, people are like, what is it about him that's so funny?
[01:02:39.225 --> 01:02:42.846]  It's that he's obviously, folks, has about a 75 IQ.
[01:02:44.487 --> 01:02:45.788]  He's a sad person.
[01:02:47.068 --> 01:02:52.971]  I'm not happy his eyes don't point the right directions, but I mean, that's who these people are.
[01:02:56.021 --> 01:02:58.402]  And that's, that's who's taking over.
[01:02:58.442 --> 01:03:00.342]  And then the globalists go, well you're for eugenics then.
[01:03:00.903 --> 01:03:01.183]  No!
[01:03:01.363 --> 01:03:07.565]  You've purposefully dumbed people down so you have a bunch of idiots to take over the system and then get rid of everybody.
[01:03:08.585 --> 01:03:13.327]  I don't want to wipe them out just because, you know, the poor guy is a gibbering idiot.
[01:03:15.956 --> 01:03:20.779]  I mean, it's just a bunch of morons run by criminals, but here's the difference.
[01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:28.285]  I guess that kind of countervenes my theory that 30-40% are total idiots, because 9% support this phony war.
[01:03:28.305 --> 01:03:29.366]  I know I keep harping on that.
[01:03:29.406 --> 01:03:30.967]  It's just such a big deal.
[01:03:32.628 --> 01:03:34.309]  This is a short little No Man's Land segment.
[01:03:34.349 --> 01:03:40.413]  We're soon going to get rid of this and actually have to come in at like 6 after instead of 8 after.
[01:03:40.433 --> 01:03:43.576]  That's a weird clock I demanded 16 years ago when I started because I didn't want to carry
[01:03:44.409 --> 01:03:48.491]  The news that the network was carrying, it was just propaganda.
[01:03:48.772 --> 01:03:50.673]  I think it's Genesis, that was just the news that was available.
[01:03:53.094 --> 01:03:56.916]  There's not a lot of good news feeds out there.
[01:03:56.936 --> 01:04:01.539]  I'd like to come up with a radio feed sometime where we actually did news every half hour with a whole team.
[01:04:01.559 --> 01:04:03.120]  That's actually part of our plan down the road.
[01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:07.102]  The point is, I don't have the money, the time, the energy to get that going, but we'll try someday.
[01:04:07.122 --> 01:04:08.944]  If we had enough funds, we could do it.
[01:04:09.924 --> 01:04:11.225]  Enough organizational skills.
[01:04:14.599 --> 01:04:16.142]  I don't know how I digressed off into that.
[01:04:16.182 --> 01:04:23.277]  The point is that we're going to come back and talk about
[01:04:24.659 --> 01:04:51.000]  Financially, what this is doing to the world, just the idea of a war, a hot war, they're all hot, but a full-on open war, bombardment, direct action, not just CIA commandos, giving them the satellite intel and lazing targets of schools to nerve gas, like they did for Saddam, and like they did last week, under John Kerry's orders, clearly.
[01:04:52.526 --> 01:04:58.694]  So that psychopath can get up there and grandstand and everybody can go, dead children, do what I say, kill more.
[01:04:59.455 --> 01:05:01.819]  You're for Assad if you don't kill children.
[01:05:01.839 --> 01:05:03.441]  If you don't kill more.

[01:08:14.366 --> 01:08:18.552]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:08:19.213 --> 01:08:20.014]  You want answers?
[01:08:20.796 --> 01:08:21.737]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:22.338 --> 01:08:25.983]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:26.544 --> 01:08:30.610]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:34.715 --> 01:08:39.400]  All right, coming up later in the hour, we're scheduled to have Mark Moreno on to break down all the new fraud.
[01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:42.644]  CNN says the polar bears are all dying when it's the opposite.
[01:08:42.664 --> 01:08:44.746]  Their numbers are five-fold what they were 50 years ago.
[01:08:44.786 --> 01:08:45.547]  That's on record.
[01:08:45.948 --> 01:08:49.171]  I have a stack of news articles on that front to go over.
[01:08:50.012 --> 01:08:53.173]  Uh, they're also saying that there's now a sixth category of hurricane.
[01:08:53.593 --> 01:08:54.594]  That's how bad they are.
[01:08:54.654 --> 01:08:57.615]  It's actually, uh, hurricanes are at a decade low this year.
[01:08:58.295 --> 01:09:00.616]  And, uh, solar tornadoes are a 60-year low.
[01:09:00.656 --> 01:09:01.876]  That's USA Today, by the way.
[01:09:02.456 --> 01:09:06.758]  And NOAA, uh, the National Oceanic Group, an atmospheric administration.
[01:09:07.918 --> 01:09:09.219]  Uh, but none of that matters.
[01:09:10.922 --> 01:09:20.066]  They say, Al Gore says, that polar bears can't swim, and that the temperature's gone up, and that if you pay him money, he'll save the Earth, basically, with carbon taxes.
[01:09:22.507 --> 01:09:24.087]  Just an unbelievable lie.
[01:09:24.107 --> 01:09:24.668]  So that's coming up.
[01:09:24.688 --> 01:09:26.168]  But I want to open the phones up.
[01:09:27.029 --> 01:09:33.611]  We did this the last few days and had, like, retired former ICBM launch center people calling in.
[01:09:33.651 --> 01:09:34.852]  And I know the info on that.
[01:09:35.312 --> 01:09:36.032]  These were real people.
[01:09:36.473 --> 01:09:39.714]  We had military officers calling in with incredible data.
[01:09:40.367 --> 01:09:43.650]  You know, about what they think about what's happening over in Syria right now.
[01:09:43.990 --> 01:09:45.471]  Quite frankly, I've studied it in depth.
[01:09:45.491 --> 01:09:47.132]  That's why I knew what they were saying was so accurate.
[01:09:47.152 --> 01:09:50.775]  But it was just amazing to hear them calling into the broadcast that caliber of people.
[01:09:51.196 --> 01:09:58.321]  I'd like to hear from folks like that again today on your take of how much danger we're under from a nuclear war starting if this kicks off.
[01:09:58.682 --> 01:10:03.726]  But they've got British defense ministers saying this is a major danger of nuclear war.
[01:10:04.815 --> 01:10:09.339]  And that it could set off at least a regional war all over the Middle East and we shouldn't do whatever Saudi Arabia says.
[01:10:09.759 --> 01:10:16.925]  Saudi Arabia has come out and threatened Putin publicly to launch al-Qaeda attacks all over their border if they don't pull out of Syria.
[01:10:17.225 --> 01:10:17.985]  It's unbelievable.
[01:10:18.306 --> 01:10:20.327]  This is how world wars start with all these sides lining up.
[01:10:21.488 --> 01:10:23.530]  Just incredible information on that front.
[01:10:23.990 --> 01:10:27.393]  Mainstream British and US papers are now saying
[01:10:29.013 --> 01:10:33.096]  Obama, do you know that the rebels are mainly Al-Qaeda and that you're helping Al-Qaeda?
[01:10:33.436 --> 01:10:34.377]  Yes, of course they know.
[01:10:34.437 --> 01:10:38.460]  They helped create them with Zbigniew Brzezinski, who runs the White House foreign policy.
[01:10:39.801 --> 01:10:40.602]  He created them.
[01:10:41.963 --> 01:10:46.446]  Welded them out of the Muslim Brotherhood and jihadi groups of Wahhabists.
[01:10:47.867 --> 01:10:53.492]  The same groups the British used in 1918 when Lawrence of Arabia had to attack and invade Syria again and burn it down.
[01:10:53.932 --> 01:10:55.173]  Damascus and other areas.
[01:10:56.274 --> 01:10:57.455]  And, also,
[01:10:58.988 --> 01:11:03.613]  Used by Hitler and then turned back over to the CIA in 1947.
[01:11:05.094 --> 01:11:09.979]  I mean, this is the reality, ladies and gentlemen, of what's going on.
[01:11:10.019 --> 01:11:12.001]  They've always run these jihadis.
[01:11:12.762 --> 01:11:20.090]  It's been declassified, look it up, that in 1979 the CIA helped kick the Shah out and put the Ayatollah Khomeini in.
[01:11:21.766 --> 01:11:24.687]  Didn't mean they ran him and controlled him.
[01:11:24.727 --> 01:11:38.631]  It meant they helped put those jihadis in, just like they double-crossed them in 1953 and told them they could take over if they burned stuff up and blew things up, and then blamed it on Ahmad Mosaddegh, the secular leader, who was pro-West.
[01:11:39.271 --> 01:11:43.853]  They didn't want a pro-West, secular, poet guy to build the country up.
[01:11:43.873 --> 01:11:45.493]  They wanted to make it backwards.
[01:11:45.513 --> 01:11:46.934]  So they set them up, took him out,
[01:11:47.634 --> 01:11:48.635]  Then put the Shah in.
[01:11:48.675 --> 01:11:49.996]  The Shah wanted to build up the country.
[01:11:50.277 --> 01:11:51.137]  Double-crossed him.
[01:11:51.438 --> 01:11:52.098]  Removed him.
[01:11:52.779 --> 01:11:53.880]  Put the Shiites in.
[01:11:54.180 --> 01:11:55.542]  Well, the Shiites are nothing.
[01:11:55.962 --> 01:11:57.864]  They're only 20% of the Muslim population.
[01:11:57.924 --> 01:12:01.727]  It's the 79% that are the Sunnis.
[01:12:03.049 --> 01:12:08.594]  And the subgroup, the Wahhabis, that are kind of like the enforcers of the whole thing.
[01:12:11.229 --> 01:12:18.690]  And it's absolutely, I mean, almost like the Jesuits of the Catholic Church or something, like, you know, the special coterie that, like, enforces things or whatever.
[01:12:20.416 --> 01:12:25.021]  And this is the type of stuff that we see happening and unfolding here.
[01:12:25.501 --> 01:12:32.688]  And they just run all over the Middle East on a jihad, slaughtering Christians, Muslims, Jews, anybody they can.
[01:12:33.048 --> 01:12:34.790]  And our government is funding them.
[01:12:34.850 --> 01:12:42.277]  So I want to open the phones up for military, for police, intelligence type folks, but also general citizens on the subject of Syria.
[01:12:43.138 --> 01:13:05.673]  And the fact that all of our expert guests from Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former head of the Treasury, who did international relations for Reagan with the Russians and peace deals, and to people like Dr. Jerome Corsi, who worked in all sorts of government operations as a contractor, international operations in the Middle East, absolutely key person to talk about it.
[01:13:05.993 --> 01:13:10.356]  And he says, our government funded Al-Qaeda rebels, launched the chemical attacks.
[01:13:10.596 --> 01:13:11.917]  Here's their bragging on their sites.
[01:13:11.957 --> 01:13:12.798]  Here's their own videos.
[01:13:13.758 --> 01:13:18.501]  I mean, it's not like a news site with Assad dressing up like them, you know, his people, and doing it.
[01:13:19.101 --> 01:13:20.382]  It's the real people doing it.
[01:13:21.283 --> 01:13:24.905]  Just like the last three times they got caught doing it, because they don't care.
[01:13:26.566 --> 01:13:30.148]  They want to be rock stars of their people over there, so they're proud they're doing it.
[01:13:30.648 --> 01:13:34.290]  And they've been told, don't worry, the dumb Americans, the dumb Europeans, they'll never pay attention.
[01:13:35.441 --> 01:13:36.262]  Here's another thing the media does.
[01:13:36.282 --> 01:13:37.302]  They make it all about Assad.
[01:13:37.322 --> 01:13:39.064]  Well, Assad deserves it.
[01:13:39.124 --> 01:13:41.746]  His dad was a dictator, and so what if he was democratizing?
[01:13:42.126 --> 01:13:42.867]  He's really bad.
[01:13:42.907 --> 01:13:43.927]  We need to take him out.
[01:13:43.968 --> 01:13:44.768]  He hurt people.
[01:13:45.809 --> 01:13:48.191]  What about all of the Syrian people?
[01:13:48.551 --> 01:13:50.352]  Our government and NATO started this fight.
[01:13:50.993 --> 01:13:51.994]  What about all of them?
[01:13:52.334 --> 01:13:56.377]  What about all the war crimes being committed against them?
[01:13:56.417 --> 01:13:57.498]  What about those children?
[01:13:57.598 --> 01:13:58.499]  What about the Christian?
[01:13:58.519 --> 01:13:59.379]  Yeah, there's USA Today.
[01:13:59.439 --> 01:14:01.421]  Syrian rebels pledge loyalty to Al-Qaeda.
[01:14:03.322 --> 01:14:04.282]  That was back in June.
[01:14:04.302 --> 01:14:05.983]  What do you mean pledge loyalty?
[01:14:06.384 --> 01:14:07.804]  They've got tanks driving around.
[01:14:07.824 --> 01:14:10.085]  We've got video with flapping Al-Qaeda flags.
[01:14:10.446 --> 01:14:20.110]  And every video we see, they're going, Osama bin Laden, singing his name as they fire US and French towed missiles at Assad's tanks.
[01:14:21.331 --> 01:14:25.033]  Oh, bin Laden, after the latter, we kill Assad.
[01:14:25.353 --> 01:14:26.373]  We kill America.
[01:14:26.473 --> 01:14:27.994]  I mean, you can go watch this stuff.
[01:14:28.714 --> 01:14:29.415]  We've played it here.
[01:14:30.990 --> 01:14:35.491]  And it goes on and on, and I'm sitting here, knowing, hey, our government's running Al Qaeda.
[01:14:35.731 --> 01:14:36.731]  Shut up, conspiracy theorists!
[01:14:36.951 --> 01:14:37.991]  But that's not happening now.
[01:14:38.371 --> 01:14:40.912]  I go on all these big conservative shows, they go, you're right, this is incredible.
[01:14:41.312 --> 01:14:41.852]  Blah, blah, blah.
[01:14:42.292 --> 01:14:45.152]  Now Sean Hannity comes out and says it's not a good idea, it could cause World War III.
[01:14:45.413 --> 01:14:48.113]  Now Glenn Beck comes out and says it's not a good idea, it could cause World War III.
[01:14:48.513 --> 01:14:51.254]  Now Jack, uh, uh, uh, now Dempsey comes out.
[01:14:51.274 --> 01:14:52.434]  I was talking about Jack Dempsey, the fighter.
[01:14:52.714 --> 01:14:56.354]  Now, uh, General Dempsey comes out and says it's not a good idea, it could cause World War III.
[01:14:56.614 --> 01:14:59.295]  Now the British ministers are coming out saying it could cause World War III.
[01:15:01.394 --> 01:15:01.914]  On and on and on.
[01:15:01.934 --> 01:15:04.735]  You've got McCain going, now is the time to hit.
[01:15:05.355 --> 01:15:06.775]  Now is the time to bombard.
[01:15:06.815 --> 01:15:07.876]  I don't want just cruise missiles.
[01:15:08.256 --> 01:15:09.396]  I want cluster bombs!
[01:15:10.076 --> 01:15:14.437]  And Obama, you caused the chemical attack by telling Assad he could do it.
[01:15:14.717 --> 01:15:16.218]  Giving him fake right cover.
[01:15:18.278 --> 01:15:20.219]  I mean, McCain is such a globalist.
[01:15:20.339 --> 01:15:22.279]  Anti-gun, open border, New World Order.
[01:15:22.319 --> 01:15:23.899]  Why isn't he the head of the Democratic Party?
[01:15:24.260 --> 01:15:25.060]  Why isn't he the head of DNC?
[01:15:28.208 --> 01:15:29.908]  And it goes on and on and on.
[01:15:29.928 --> 01:15:39.050]  They got the former head of the Republican RNC, Steele, up on TV saying, I'm paid to be deeply racist when everyone knows I'm the opposite of a racist.
[01:15:40.090 --> 01:15:42.030]  I'm a real liberal like Thomas Jefferson, folks.
[01:15:42.070 --> 01:15:43.511]  I mean, I believe in liberal freedom.
[01:15:43.771 --> 01:15:46.211]  I believe in that I've got my right, you've got your right.
[01:15:46.471 --> 01:15:52.112]  And man, we got low taxes and we got due process and we got juries and we got families and you can do what you want.
[01:15:52.172 --> 01:15:55.353]  I'm tolerant of you, but you don't come tell me what to do.
[01:15:55.553 --> 01:15:57.153]  See, all this tolerance stuff isn't that.
[01:15:58.007 --> 01:16:05.872]  All these socialists and weirdos are on their own little private crusader jihad to try to convert me to all the things they do.
[01:16:05.892 --> 01:16:09.215]  First it's tolerance, then acceptance, then adoption.
[01:16:09.455 --> 01:16:12.917]  Hey man, I don't like...
[01:16:14.338 --> 01:16:15.619]  Carzoo Marzoo.
[01:16:15.859 --> 01:16:19.402]  If some of the Italians like to eat maggots and cheese, that's their issue.
[01:16:19.822 --> 01:16:21.843]  I'm not bigoted, I don't want to eat maggots and cheese.
[01:16:22.624 --> 01:16:24.125]  Pull up Carzoo Marzoo, folks don't believe it.
[01:16:24.585 --> 01:16:26.506]  I'm not bigoted against maggots and cheese.
[01:16:27.007 --> 01:16:28.828]  If you want to eat maggots and cheese, knock yourself out.
[01:16:29.208 --> 01:16:34.352]  They've also got an ancient dish going into catacombs, people's bones, thigh bones, thigh bone soup, I forget the name of that.
[01:16:35.293 --> 01:16:41.697]  But I mean, you know, I'm not anti-Italian because some Italians, you know, in Corsica or whatever, eat that.
[01:16:43.208 --> 01:16:44.408]  Karzoo Marzoo, guys.
[01:16:44.468 --> 01:16:45.169]  Maggots and cheese.
[01:16:45.209 --> 01:16:45.829]  It'll come right up.
[01:16:46.569 --> 01:16:47.249]  Okay, fantastic.
[01:16:47.269 --> 01:16:47.669]  Just type it in.
[01:16:47.689 --> 01:16:48.350]  It's the first image.
[01:16:48.670 --> 01:16:49.270]  Maggots and cheese.
[01:16:49.510 --> 01:16:51.611]  You know, he said, I don't like maggots and cheese.
[01:16:52.111 --> 01:16:54.772]  Oh, you're discriminating against those of us that want to eat maggots and cheese.
[01:16:54.872 --> 01:16:56.832]  No, I don't like maggots and cheese.
[01:16:57.593 --> 01:16:58.893]  You like maggots and cheese.
[01:16:59.713 --> 01:17:04.015]  And the globalists like warmongering and war profiteering and bottomless pits.
[01:17:04.135 --> 01:17:04.495]  Yeah, there it is.
[01:17:04.535 --> 01:17:05.455]  Karzoo Marzoo.
[01:17:05.535 --> 01:17:06.295]  Maggot cheese.
[01:17:07.136 --> 01:17:08.796]  Utterly delicious.
[01:17:09.356 --> 01:17:11.057]  As I told you, it's a Sardinian dish.
[01:17:12.316 --> 01:17:13.757]  Obviously I'm anti-Italian.
[01:17:14.717 --> 01:17:23.281]  That's like when I'm criticizing the communist Chinese trying to run our media and all these movies they're having stopped from being released and buying up the big movie houses and the theater chains.
[01:17:24.182 --> 01:17:25.942]  Alex Jones doesn't like Chinese people.
[01:17:26.222 --> 01:17:27.623]  No, I love Chinese people.
[01:17:28.223 --> 01:17:32.185]  I don't like the commie Chinese government trying to run my life.
[01:17:32.405 --> 01:17:34.806]  Just like I don't like the Pentagon involved in domestic propaganda.
[01:17:35.027 --> 01:17:35.607]  Understand that?
[01:17:37.113 --> 01:17:38.394]  So here's the toll-free number.
[01:17:38.554 --> 01:17:40.195]  I want to hear from you.
[01:17:40.215 --> 01:17:40.255]  800-259-9231.
[01:17:40.275 --> 01:17:40.995]  800-259-9231.
[01:17:41.015 --> 01:17:48.359]  If you've been calling in, we don't answer the phones.
[01:17:48.380 --> 01:17:48.980]  I'll get the number out.
[01:17:49.220 --> 01:17:50.841]  Phones are now open.
[01:17:50.861 --> 01:17:51.301]  800-259-9231.
[01:17:51.641 --> 01:17:54.623]  I want to hear from everybody.
[01:17:55.023 --> 01:18:00.526]  Unless you're at home, drinking corn syrup, laced cough syrup, and smoking dope.
[01:18:01.727 --> 01:18:03.288]  I'm not discriminating against pot smokers.
[01:18:03.328 --> 01:18:04.609]  I believe it should be decriminalized.
[01:18:05.759 --> 01:18:10.762]  But I don't mean I don't actually dislike a lot of pot smokers, I know, because they're brain-damaged people.
[01:18:11.142 --> 01:18:12.703]  You're like, yeah, man, you're against weed, dude.
[01:18:12.723 --> 01:18:14.144]  It's gonna save the whole earth.
[01:18:14.384 --> 01:18:15.344]  It boosts your IQ.
[01:18:15.384 --> 01:18:15.864]  No, it doesn't.
[01:18:18.066 --> 01:18:20.207]  See, I agree with your right to smoke it.
[01:18:20.647 --> 01:18:21.367]  You just don't.
[01:18:21.487 --> 01:18:22.448]  I'm just not cool.
[01:18:22.608 --> 01:18:23.829]  I'm not gonna smoke it with you.
[01:18:25.950 --> 01:18:27.791]  Unless I'm going through chemotherapy or something.
[01:18:27.811 --> 01:18:28.611]  I need to hold down food.
[01:18:28.631 --> 01:18:29.512]  It does work great for that.
[01:18:29.992 --> 01:18:35.375]  See, that's the difference between discriminating taste does not mean you're discriminating against a person.
[01:18:37.930 --> 01:18:43.495]  You know, some people might like a certain type of car.
[01:18:45.046 --> 01:18:54.529]  But again, we have Austinites yesterday, we're going to air this tonight, saying ban the term brown bag, as Seattle has done, because it's racist, and ban the family, because it's bad.
[01:18:54.569 --> 01:18:58.090]  See, anything that doesn't agree with them has to be banned.
[01:18:58.170 --> 01:19:05.612]  They're the intolerant, on fire, authoritarians being manipulated by the social engineers.
[01:19:05.852 --> 01:19:09.353]  Meanwhile, we have real issues to deal with, like the possibility of nuclear war.
[01:19:09.373 --> 01:19:10.473]  But look at this article right here.
[01:19:11.730 --> 01:19:21.696]  Sakjin says the Syrian conflict could spill over into Iraq and Brent oil could surge to $150 a barrel.
[01:19:21.736 --> 01:19:22.736]  That's Business Insider.
[01:19:23.877 --> 01:19:31.241]  Jim Rogers, renowned analyst, warns Syrian war and market panic to send gold much, much higher.
[01:19:32.847 --> 01:19:33.727]  Market has spoken.
[01:19:33.767 --> 01:19:35.408]  A Syrian war would be terrible.
[01:19:35.828 --> 01:19:37.928]  Washington blog, up on InfoWars.com.
[01:19:38.308 --> 01:19:43.630]  And it goes through the Dow, the FTSE, the Japanese, the Canadian, other stock markets went way down on war drums.
[01:19:44.090 --> 01:19:46.491]  Crude oil soared 52-week high on war jitters.
[01:19:46.851 --> 01:19:49.011]  And gold, a safe haven asset, dimes uncertainty.
[01:19:49.351 --> 01:19:51.032]  And his trust in government has skyrocketed.
[01:19:51.872 --> 01:19:52.953]  This is not surprising.
[01:19:52.973 --> 01:19:57.374]  Top financial analysts have long forecast war, but they say that war is bad for the economy.
[01:19:57.715 --> 01:19:59.756]  Not so if you're an insider globalist.
[01:20:00.196 --> 01:20:06.098]  Syrian Electronic Army takes down New York Times website, claims Twitter domains.
[01:20:06.138 --> 01:20:09.100]  That's some of what's coming up in your phone calls straight ahead.
[01:20:09.820 --> 01:20:13.902]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.

[01:21:13.395 --> 01:21:15.217]  So you may know a few things about him.
[01:21:15.498 --> 01:21:21.745]  For example, you are well aware of the superior quality and effectiveness of Berkey water filters and accessories.
[01:21:22.185 --> 01:21:27.451]  But did you know the Berkeys have had independent lab tests done to prove just how effective they are?
[01:21:27.792 --> 01:21:28.272]  It's true!
[01:21:28.513 --> 01:21:30.315]  And he can email you the test results.

[01:22:38.436 --> 01:22:47.682]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[01:22:47.742 --> 01:22:48.462]  This capitalism?
[01:22:48.522 --> 01:22:54.646]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:22:54.686 --> 01:22:58.328]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[01:23:08.154 --> 01:23:09.315]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:23:09.576 --> 01:23:20.026]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[01:23:20.227 --> 01:23:24.331]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.
[01:23:24.691 --> 01:23:27.113]  But we can't do that without your help.
[01:23:27.433 --> 01:23:38.300]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at InfoWars.com, you will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:41.862]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[01:23:42.182 --> 01:23:47.846]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[01:23:48.326 --> 01:23:57.832]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[01:23:58.213 --> 01:23:59.393]  The war is here.
[01:23:59.734 --> 01:24:01.135]  It's an info war.
[01:24:01.635 --> 01:24:03.556]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[01:24:24.541 --> 01:24:26.142]  All right, my friends, we're back live.
[01:24:26.182 --> 01:24:27.823]  We're about to go to Mark Moreno here in a second.
[01:24:27.883 --> 01:24:32.844]  Some of the top headlines up on Infowars.com right now.
[01:24:33.325 --> 01:24:36.146]  Wall Street Journal says whack Assad and his family.
[01:24:36.846 --> 01:24:39.087]  Yeah, and they're also saying kill Snowden.
[01:24:39.887 --> 01:24:41.489]  That's such nice people.
[01:24:41.889 --> 01:24:42.790]  World War III.
[01:24:42.990 --> 01:24:48.715]  Syrian-Iranian officials say Israel will set off fire if U.S.
[01:24:48.835 --> 01:24:49.336]  strikes.
[01:24:49.936 --> 01:24:50.977]  Bombshell evidence.
[01:24:51.037 --> 01:24:53.740]  Syrian rebels carried out gas attack.
[01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:59.225]  Even World Net Daily is reporting that with the videos of the jihadis celebrating, running around, launching it last week.
[01:25:00.526 --> 01:25:04.189]  Also, the media is conquering weapons of mass destruction to push
[01:25:05.150 --> 01:25:09.414]  The attack, and intelligence suggests Assad not behind chemical weapons attack.
[01:25:09.434 --> 01:25:15.280]  The stuff the Israelis are bringing out is a general screaming at his chemical corps saying you better not be behind this.
[01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:16.521]  What's going on?
[01:25:17.162 --> 01:25:18.343]  How does that prove they did it?
[01:25:19.614 --> 01:25:22.215]  Unbelievable information.
[01:25:22.735 --> 01:25:24.756]  And we'll get Mark Moreno's brief take on that when he leaves us.
[01:25:24.776 --> 01:25:26.376]  He'll be here with us about 45 after.
[01:25:26.676 --> 01:25:29.757]  Then I'll go to all the callers that are holding to talk about the situation.
[01:25:30.057 --> 01:25:37.920]  But the reason I wanted to get Mark Moreno on, former Communications Director for the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and Senatorial aide.
[01:25:38.860 --> 01:25:40.201]  To Senator Inhofe.
[01:25:40.561 --> 01:25:42.322]  We probably have carbon taxes now, but it wasn't for him.
[01:25:43.043 --> 01:25:46.685]  And he has a degree in political science at George Mason University.
[01:25:47.746 --> 01:25:50.227]  He's also held both White House and Capitol Press credentials.
[01:25:50.287 --> 01:25:56.511]  And the really cool thing is he produced Rush Limbaugh's TV show for its four-year hit run before the censors got it shut down.
[01:25:56.531 --> 01:25:57.852]  And he's also a journalist.
[01:25:58.112 --> 01:26:00.113]  This is a short segment, long segment coming up, Mark.
[01:26:00.554 --> 01:26:02.855]  I had to get you on because of these headlines.
[01:26:03.436 --> 01:26:06.798]  Al Gore says it's racist now in the Huffington Post.
[01:26:07.918 --> 01:26:10.180]  Uh, to, uh, not pay him carbon taxes.
[01:26:10.641 --> 01:26:12.883]  And I have a CNN piece we're gonna play coming up in the next segment.
[01:26:13.123 --> 01:26:13.744]  I'm sure you saw it.
[01:26:14.304 --> 01:26:16.626]  Where they again said the whole ice cap in the North's melted.
[01:26:16.666 --> 01:26:18.127]  They don't tell you in the summer, it always shrinks.
[01:26:18.448 --> 01:26:19.889]  And that the polar bears are all dying.
[01:26:20.490 --> 01:26:23.933]  I mean, these, these people are amazing, their level of lying.
[01:26:24.413 --> 01:26:26.415]  But I don't see people buying into it anymore, Mark.
[01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:27.820]  No.
[01:26:28.221 --> 01:26:30.662]  In fact, there's a big UN report coming out.
[01:26:31.003 --> 01:26:34.845]  They're going to re-hype all of the same nonsense again.
[01:26:35.826 --> 01:26:36.767]  You mentioned Al Gore.
[01:26:36.827 --> 01:26:53.699]  What Al Gore is doing is he's telling Americans that you either believe in my version of global warming science or you are, in his words, a homophobe, a racist, you're pro-apartheid, you're anti-abolitionist, meaning you are pro-slavery,
[01:26:54.559 --> 01:27:00.440]  He said that you are someone who's akin to an alcoholic father who's abusing his family.
[01:27:01.081 --> 01:27:12.143]  So, just on the level of persuasion, he's telling Americans, who more Americans, according to Gallup polling, believe in haunted houses, 37%, than man-made global warming, 36%.
[01:27:12.183 --> 01:27:16.704]  This was done even, that was a poll from pre-climate change and nothing's changed.
[01:27:17.304 --> 01:27:19.925]  He's telling Americans that unless you believe
[01:27:20.485 --> 01:27:24.633]  Like he does, you're all of those allegedly horrible and nasty things.
[01:27:26.829 --> 01:27:27.509]  It's unbelievable.
[01:27:27.529 --> 01:27:53.838]  I had MSNBC two weeks ago without showing a clip say I'm quote deeply racist and that I quote in the profit of the libertarians who staged the Boston bombing and I talked to my lawyer he said we can probably win but do I want to mess with it for two years but my question is and they showed no proof of this why are they getting so crazy I mean I can probably win a lawsuit but I probably won't do it just because no one believes them they're such discredited kooks
[01:27:54.398 --> 01:28:02.743]  Yes, well, the reason Al Gore and now the new UN reports, you're going to hear all about this in September, it's going to be coming out by the end of September, they're going to be hyping everything.
[01:28:02.763 --> 01:28:05.024]  They're going to claim global warming is worse than we thought.
[01:28:05.064 --> 01:28:06.145]  And how do they claim this?
[01:28:06.545 --> 01:28:11.148]  By making the predictions of 50 to 100 years much more scary than they ever were.
[01:28:11.168 --> 01:28:12.789]  And that's what Al Gore is counting on.
[01:28:13.069 --> 01:28:14.210]  But here's why they're desperate.
[01:28:14.980 --> 01:28:19.763]  Global average temperatures, depending on the data set, 15 to 20 years with no global warming.
[01:28:19.803 --> 01:28:26.006]  I mean, that means kids going off to college this year, Alex, have never experienced global warming in their life.
[01:28:26.026 --> 01:28:28.948]  When I was a kid in Dallas, it was over 110 every summer.
[01:28:29.568 --> 01:28:32.270]  It's hit 110 once in the last decade.
[01:28:32.650 --> 01:28:34.471]  Yeah, very cool summer here in the United States.
[01:28:34.911 --> 01:28:35.392]  Here's the thing.
[01:28:36.172 --> 01:28:37.553]  They've never experienced it in their life.
[01:28:37.693 --> 01:28:38.714]  And here's even more sad.
[01:28:38.734 --> 01:28:43.758]  Since 2002 now, nine-year-olds have only experienced global cooling.
[01:28:43.798 --> 01:28:45.879]  The Earth has been cooling since 2002.
[01:28:46.660 --> 01:28:52.925]  No warming at all in 15 to 20 years again, depending on the data set and whether you go statistically significant or just no warming.
[01:28:53.145 --> 01:28:53.525]  Yeah, sure.
[01:28:53.545 --> 01:28:53.986]  Be honest.
[01:28:54.046 --> 01:28:56.708]  It's actually, temperatures actually dropped, but we're just saying it's flat.
[01:28:57.443 --> 01:28:59.584]  Yes, well, they're dropping in the last few years.
[01:28:59.604 --> 01:29:03.386]  If you go even a shorter time, since 2002 we've been cooling it very slightly.
[01:29:03.886 --> 01:29:17.653]  And now we have Russian scientists from the Russian Academy of Sciences, we have geologists in America like Don Easterbrook, we have ocean specialists, hurricane specialists like Dr. Bill Gray, warning of global cooling coming now.
[01:29:17.673 --> 01:29:21.915]  Oh yeah, NASA came out, as you know, and said, oh, we're going to freeze it if you don't pay Al Gore money.
[01:29:23.686 --> 01:29:28.108]  Yeah, and this is a redux now of the 1970s, when they worried about the global cooling.
[01:29:28.128 --> 01:29:29.128]  So we've come full circle.
[01:29:29.148 --> 01:29:32.910]  By the way, you predicted two years ago here, I want to come back and talk about it, but I remember it.
[01:29:33.130 --> 01:29:36.191]  I'm sure we can pull up the articles at climatedepot.com.
[01:29:36.211 --> 01:29:39.592]  Folks, search climatedepot.com and then put in, next will be global cooling.
[01:29:39.872 --> 01:29:42.113]  A couple years ago, you predicted they would do this.
[01:29:42.593 --> 01:29:46.235]  So I want to come back and ask how you knew they'd do that.
[01:29:46.335 --> 01:29:48.616]  I mean, these people are amazing.
[01:29:49.016 --> 01:29:50.438]  Mark Moreno is our guest.
[01:29:50.918 --> 01:29:56.604]  Hey, the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds, Al Gore, Obama, carbon taxes, or you'll freeze to death.
[01:29:57.165 --> 01:29:57.765]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:58.827 --> 01:30:01.830]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:30:02.751 --> 01:30:05.434]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:10.140 --> 01:30:17.466]  Dozens of diseases ranging from the common cold and flu to MRSA and pneumonia are all caused by infectious pathogens.
[01:30:17.907 --> 01:30:21.710]  Fortunately, a simple, safe and effective alternative exists.

[01:31:09.642 --> 01:31:14.225]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[01:31:14.365 --> 01:31:17.327]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[01:31:17.487 --> 01:31:22.731]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[01:31:23.071 --> 01:31:24.732]  It all comes down to one thing.
[01:31:24.992 --> 01:31:26.313]  We are what we eat.
[01:31:26.633 --> 01:31:30.956]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[01:31:31.297 --> 01:31:35.279]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[01:31:35.519 --> 01:31:37.781]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[01:31:38.061 --> 01:31:43.990]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[01:33:20.888 --> 01:33:23.873]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:33:24.474 --> 01:33:28.622]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:32.466 --> 01:33:36.669]  Alright, Mark Moreno is with us for another 10 minutes or so, then I'm going right to your phone calls.
[01:33:37.209 --> 01:33:59.084]  And the latest on the economy, the latest on the scandals that this whole Syria thing is beautifully distracting from, that Mark Moreno is, in the United States at least, the most prominent compiler of the real data of the criminal takeover, the mafia takeover of the economy by the collectivists and some of the big robber barons that make their money out of government control and crony capitalism.
[01:33:59.964 --> 01:34:10.750]  What they're doing with their fake green movement that ignores all the real environmental issues that we all agree on when we see the facts and then brings in a phony set that empowers them.
[01:34:11.490 --> 01:34:18.234]  Mark, I want to play a clip from just a few minutes long from CNN here in a few minutes of their latest lies that I saw last Friday.
[01:34:19.314 --> 01:34:27.259]  But first, I wanted to talk to you here today about
[01:34:28.297 --> 01:34:30.399]  Their whole operation, what they're doing.
[01:34:30.439 --> 01:34:36.924]  I saw a month ago a headline where Obama raised the price of carbon in a microwave regulation.
[01:34:37.265 --> 01:34:43.750]  So some of the things the roaches are up to and how we stop them and some of the trends we've got to watch out for.
[01:34:43.770 --> 01:34:48.875]  Because I have seen the warming up you mentioned on all the channels that, look, we're all going to freeze to death.
[01:34:48.935 --> 01:34:51.357]  We're dead if we don't let these people run our lives.
[01:34:52.458 --> 01:34:55.099]  Yeah, well here's what's frightening about what's happening in Washington right now.
[01:34:55.740 --> 01:35:00.462]  And in a way, you've got to give the Obama administration evil credit, if you will.
[01:35:01.403 --> 01:35:11.067]  They are now, instead of going with climate control regulations and regulations on carbon dioxide, remember, humans inhale oxygen, we exhale CO2, carbon dioxide.
[01:35:11.288 --> 01:35:17.271]  So the Obama administration, through the EPA, is poised to regulate what we exhale through our mouth, CO2,
[01:35:18.331 --> 01:35:22.752]  As a pollutant under the Clean Air Act, the Supreme Court gave them the authority to do this.
[01:35:23.213 --> 01:35:48.080]  So instead of going for a big, brassy UN treaty that requires Senate ratification, that requires big international meetings, instead of going for a big cap-and-trade bill, which has failed in the House, well, the last one passed in the House, but failed in the Senate, and other bills have failed, and despite trying to go for a carbon tax, which would be a rough road, which would awaken, if you will, the American people and shut down Washington if they tried
[01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:50.841]  So Congress needs to pass law defunding them or stripping them, correct?
[01:36:17.575 --> 01:36:25.400]  Yes, and the GOP has talked about a one-third budget cut next year for the EPA if they start regulating carbon dioxide.
[01:36:25.740 --> 01:36:34.746]  The problem is, our liberty, our freedom, is going to depend on the Republican leaders in Congress, and that is a very scary thought.
[01:36:34.966 --> 01:36:41.270]  When you think of them standing up on an environmental issue, on global warming, I don't see them having the guts to do it.
[01:36:41.570 --> 01:36:46.453]  I don't see them having the fortitude to stand up to Obama and prevent this.
[01:36:46.733 --> 01:36:47.913]  There's also lawsuits.
[01:36:47.933 --> 01:36:48.914]  There's many scientists.
[01:36:49.394 --> 01:36:53.055]  Industry is suing, is poised to sue and has already filed some lawsuits.
[01:36:53.836 --> 01:36:59.938]  And other foundations are fighting this, which could delay some of these regulations.
[01:37:00.378 --> 01:37:05.260]  But the bottom line is the only surefire way to stop this would be to defund the EPA.
[01:37:05.620 --> 01:37:07.081]  And I worked in Washington.
[01:37:07.181 --> 01:37:08.841]  I worked for Republicans in Washington.
[01:37:09.081 --> 01:37:11.882]  And I can tell you right now, they don't have the balls to do it.
[01:37:12.082 --> 01:37:16.144]  To speak a little bit, a little bit of colloquialism there.
[01:37:16.903 --> 01:37:18.005]  This is terrible news.
[01:37:18.205 --> 01:37:20.088]  I live in Austin, Texas under Agenda 21.
[01:37:20.208 --> 01:37:21.911]  I mean, we get UN awards.
[01:37:22.632 --> 01:37:24.214]  Our sister city's over in Japan.
[01:37:24.635 --> 01:37:27.159]  We are the world model of two cities for Agenda 21.
[01:37:28.567 --> 01:37:31.389]  We had four city-owned power plants.
[01:37:31.429 --> 01:37:33.230]  They shut down three the last decade.
[01:37:33.851 --> 01:37:36.453]  And now they're shutting the last one down that's outside Austin.
[01:37:36.753 --> 01:37:40.636]  The power prices, they admit in the paper, have doubled in the last five.
[01:37:41.116 --> 01:37:43.638]  And the mayor goes, well, you shouldn't have cheap power.
[01:37:44.058 --> 01:37:50.683]  But then the government and the elite areas, you can't make this up, they get a lower rate and are guaranteed no power out of you.
[01:37:50.703 --> 01:37:53.425]  So it's like I live in Romania under Ceausescu.
[01:37:53.845 --> 01:37:55.947]  They're now going to be announcing I'm not going to have power.
[01:37:55.987 --> 01:37:57.148]  So I moved outside Austin.
[01:37:57.828 --> 01:37:59.369]  But there's already such a power problem.
[01:37:59.389 --> 01:38:00.510]  We're having record blackouts.
[01:38:00.810 --> 01:38:06.553]  So now we get our power from Mexico, where these very same green groups have actually invested.
[01:38:06.593 --> 01:38:10.035]  They have dirty power plants now supplying Texas with the power.
[01:38:10.576 --> 01:38:12.557]  I mean, these people are saboteurs!
[01:38:13.177 --> 01:38:22.382]  Yeah, in fact, Mayor Bloomberg in New York City has bragged that his partnering with environmental groups has prevented hundreds of coal plants from going online.
[01:38:22.622 --> 01:38:27.444]  Meanwhile in China, the latest estimate is every 10 days new coal plants go online.
[01:38:28.105 --> 01:38:31.726]  We are the Saudi Arabia of coal in the United States.
[01:38:31.746 --> 01:38:32.607]  We have that much coal.
[01:38:32.887 --> 01:38:38.152]  The Obama administration is systematically shutting down the largest percentage of our energy.
[01:38:38.612 --> 01:38:58.971]  And here's the thing, in places where they've already passed these insane regulations and they're living it, like California, we had Arnold Schwarzenegger come out, and you may have covered this a few weeks ago, he warned the global warming skeptics, or deniers as he called them, they should quote, strap some conservative thinking people to a tailpipe for an hour and they will agree that CO2 is a pollutant, unquote.
[01:38:59.611 --> 01:39:00.932]  This is what we're met with.
[01:39:01.252 --> 01:39:04.875]  Arnold Schwarzenegger is now making his grand entrance.
[01:39:04.895 --> 01:39:10.018]  He was met with raucous applause and laughter at the environmental conference he was at when he made these remarks.
[01:39:10.699 --> 01:39:12.260]  This is what we're faced with the U.S.
[01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:12.640]  Well, wait.
[01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:17.624]  His dad was an SS captain and actually helped strap people to tailpipes.
[01:39:17.924 --> 01:39:18.724]  So I guess he would know.
[01:39:18.764 --> 01:39:19.365]  I'm not joking.
[01:39:19.745 --> 01:39:22.146]  He was best buddies with Kurt Voltheim, a top SS commander.
[01:39:22.546 --> 01:39:25.788]  I guess Arnold could teach, and he wears skull hats.
[01:39:26.088 --> 01:39:27.649]  I guess he could teach us.
[01:39:28.129 --> 01:39:31.470]  I remember what he said, what was it, five years ago at Copenhagen.
[01:39:31.690 --> 01:39:40.474]  He said, we will go to the cities and the states and the regulations and do it, regardless of what Congress does, because I will dictate when you will pay me carbon tax.
[01:39:40.654 --> 01:39:41.875]  How about he goes back to Austria?
[01:39:42.813 --> 01:39:44.074]  Yeah, well, he's just one example.
[01:39:44.094 --> 01:39:52.799]  The head of the UN, the UN panel, which is coming out, has said that he'd like to see skeptics or deniers rub asbestos on their bodies and faces.
[01:39:53.099 --> 01:39:57.941]  I mean, these are veiled, disgusting threats against global warming skeptics.
[01:39:57.961 --> 01:40:00.223]  This is the nature of the debate as they're coming out.
[01:40:00.303 --> 01:40:05.986]  Meanwhile, more UN scientists, people like a Swedish scientist, have come out and defected and essentially said,
[01:40:06.246 --> 01:40:10.913]  You wouldn't even notice the global warming over the last hundred years if we didn't have modern instrumentation.
[01:40:11.333 --> 01:40:18.864]  It's an artifact of all these sophisticated... Totally, and give it back to Schwarzenegger for those that don't know, I even made a film that part of it's about him, the film Martial Law.
[01:40:20.029 --> 01:40:22.112]  His dad wasn't just a German soldier.
[01:40:22.672 --> 01:40:26.537]  He was an SS town leader and rounded people up.
[01:40:27.198 --> 01:40:30.602]  So according to that, George Soros ought to hire him because that's what George Soros did.
[01:40:30.902 --> 01:40:31.943]  He helped round people up.
[01:40:32.244 --> 01:40:38.852]  So I guess everybody's good that actually worked for the Nazis, but we're racist according to Al Gore because we don't like Nazis, Mark Moreno.
[01:40:39.997 --> 01:40:42.279]  Yeah, and again, he gets away with this.
[01:40:42.319 --> 01:40:46.782]  This was met with laughter, so... And keep in mind, this is, again, in line.
[01:40:46.822 --> 01:40:54.347]  The German climate advisor, a man named Hans Schuttenhuber, has come out and called for a CO2 budget for every man, woman, and child on the planet.
[01:40:54.387 --> 01:40:54.727]  I saw that.
[01:40:55.007 --> 01:40:55.568]  So have the British.
[01:40:55.968 --> 01:40:56.908]  And this is scary stuff.
[01:40:56.928 --> 01:40:58.089]  You mentioned the power outages.
[01:40:58.129 --> 01:41:05.512]  In the UK, their power plant chief has said that families can't get used to power on tap.
[01:41:05.752 --> 01:41:07.652]  In other words, they have to get the power when it's available.
[01:41:07.693 --> 01:41:09.433]  They're warning of the coming blackouts.
[01:41:09.653 --> 01:41:14.335]  This is going to be governments and government regulating how much energy we need.
[01:41:14.355 --> 01:41:15.636]  Yeah, they want to make us poor.
[01:41:15.736 --> 01:41:19.277]  You increase the price of energy and collectivize everything.
[01:41:20.356 --> 01:41:21.256]  And that's exactly right.
[01:41:21.596 --> 01:41:24.638]  He who controls carbon dioxide controls life.
[01:41:25.118 --> 01:41:28.059]  And that is one of the most frightening things, is to hand this over.
[01:41:28.319 --> 01:41:31.660]  But once again, Obama is poised to be successful.
[01:41:32.021 --> 01:41:39.343]  They're going to have the greatest success they've ever had, the global warming activists, because it's going to happen behind the scenes in Washington, in the bureaucracy.
[01:41:39.543 --> 01:41:40.764]  There's not going to be a big bill
[01:41:41.184 --> 01:41:43.206]  Congress isn't going to get flooded with phone calls.
[01:41:43.426 --> 01:41:48.790]  Talk radio is not going to light up the dials of people talking about this, because it's going to be done quietly and behind the scenes.
[01:41:48.970 --> 01:41:54.434]  And you've got to give them a sort of sick credit, because this is what they should have done in the first place.
[01:41:54.454 --> 01:41:59.098]  This is how real freedom is destroyed in Washington, is behind the scenes.
[01:41:59.659 --> 01:42:02.180]  It can also happen in big bills in Congress.
[01:42:02.981 --> 01:42:04.842]  Uh, you know, like the Patriot Act and other things.
[01:42:05.062 --> 01:42:08.485]  But the real damage is done behind the scenes like this.
[01:42:08.905 --> 01:42:15.109]  And the, you know, the horrible ruling in 2007 when the Supreme Court said that CO2 could be regulated as a pollutant.
[01:42:15.129 --> 01:42:19.412]  It doesn't mean the EPA has to do it, but if the EPA finds it, it does it.
[01:42:19.432 --> 01:42:23.695]  By the way, guess what the EPA uses to find that CO2 is a pollutant?
[01:42:23.895 --> 01:42:30.339]  They use the science of the United Nations, which is an activist political organization masquerading as a science body.
[01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:32.661]  So the US, our freedom,
[01:42:33.021 --> 01:42:33.261]  Absolutely.
[01:42:54.830 --> 01:42:58.452]  Well, you know, they've shut down, it wasn't the first few years, it was over 200 power plants.
[01:42:58.512 --> 01:42:59.692]  Now they've shut down hundreds more.
[01:42:59.712 --> 01:43:01.173]  Now they're talking about thousands.
[01:43:01.593 --> 01:43:13.139]  Everybody needs to know, going back to the Nazi analogy, when my grandfather was flying out of North Africa into Italy in a B-17 bomber, they were bombing their power plants.
[01:43:13.579 --> 01:43:16.461]  That's what you do to bring down a country is you blow up their power plants.
[01:43:16.801 --> 01:43:18.962]  Well, the trendies, they just go and turn them off.
[01:43:19.582 --> 01:43:23.144]  I mean, that's how they're literally shutting America down.
[01:43:23.164 --> 01:43:33.688]  When you see Godzilla, hypothetically, you know, attacking Tokyo, I mean, that's what I see Obama and Al Gore as, is like Level 5 Kaijus attacking America.
[01:43:33.748 --> 01:43:34.609]  Why do they want to do that?
[01:43:35.762 --> 01:43:43.746]  Well, John Holter in 1975, Obama's science advisor, said one of the great hazards of a free society is abundant sheep energy.
[01:43:44.186 --> 01:43:44.487]  Why?
[01:43:44.707 --> 01:43:47.788]  Because it goes against their mantra of overpopulation.
[01:43:48.068 --> 01:43:48.749]  They essentially want to have
[01:43:51.110 --> 01:43:55.976]  International bean counters and regulators controlling every aspect of our life.
[01:43:56.036 --> 01:44:06.408]  In fact, Nancy Pelosi went to China in 2009 and said exactly what I just said, that in order to fight global warming we need a complete inventory on every aspect of our lives.
[01:44:06.628 --> 01:44:08.410]  The UN, I was down in Rio last
[01:44:08.770 --> 01:44:14.297]  I guess it was a little over a year ago, June 2012, they had a meeting on sustainable development.
[01:44:14.337 --> 01:44:25.790]  The United Nations went to get their hands on regulating waterways, land use, agriculture, roadways, the oceans, in addition to our atmosphere, our industry, our climate.
[01:44:26.090 --> 01:44:27.691]  All in the name of saving the Earth.
[01:44:28.131 --> 01:44:42.778]  And this is why the Czech President, Václav Klaus, which I'm sure you're very familiar with, has said, since the fall of the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc, the greatest threat to freedom in the world is what he termed ambitious environmentalism.
[01:44:42.978 --> 01:44:47.442]  Absolutely, and I want to play a clip for you since we mentioned it, because this happened six years ago during the campaign.
[01:44:47.462 --> 01:44:48.183]  People deny it.
[01:44:48.924 --> 01:44:56.350]  This is Obama in a press conference saying, if you have a coal plant, that's fine, but we will bankrupt you.
[01:44:56.390 --> 01:44:58.753]  We will set the taxes to a level.
[01:44:58.793 --> 01:45:02.716]  And George Washington said the power to tax is the power to destroy.
[01:45:03.017 --> 01:45:08.502]  They're using selective regulations and taxes as racketeers, because GE is exempt.
[01:45:09.042 --> 01:45:11.984]  on Obama's counsel to shut down their competition.
[01:45:12.044 --> 01:45:13.925]  These are Chicago scum.
[01:45:14.326 --> 01:45:15.887]  Ken Lay came up with this plan.
[01:45:16.107 --> 01:45:16.567]  Here it is.
[01:45:17.748 --> 01:45:20.170]  So if somebody wants to build a coal-powered plant, they can.
[01:45:20.770 --> 01:45:28.615]  It's just that it will bankrupt them because they're going to be charged a huge sum for all that greenhouse gas that's being emitted.
[01:45:29.596 --> 01:45:31.417]  And by the way, we're on the radio in Chicago.
[01:45:31.437 --> 01:45:32.258]  I have family in Chicago.
[01:45:32.298 --> 01:45:32.838]  It's a great city.
[01:45:32.878 --> 01:45:35.059]  I mean, Chicago mafia scum.
[01:45:35.740 --> 01:45:36.941]  I mean, this is amazing, Mark.
[01:45:37.952 --> 01:45:50.426]  Yes, and he's stated it very clearly, and he's following through on it, and that's what people who think, oh, this is, you know, he doesn't really mean it, this isn't going to be that bad, you know, this is... My power bill is double what it was five years ago!
[01:45:50.446 --> 01:45:51.688]  Can people understand this?
[01:45:52.388 --> 01:45:58.856]  And again, this is abundant, cheap, American energy that he's shutting down, and you're absolutely right, we're going to end up importing energy.
[01:46:12.456 --> 01:46:24.147]  When you look at even oil, they had to sue to get oil drilling back going in the United States, and Obama went to Brazil and said, hey, we'll buy as much oil for you as possible.
[01:46:24.167 --> 01:46:28.811]  He wants us to be dependent on the developing world's energy.
[01:46:29.012 --> 01:46:30.413]  He wants to restrict our energy.
[01:46:30.433 --> 01:46:33.896]  It's all part of that globalist agenda.
[01:46:36.118 --> 01:46:38.020]  That most of the presidents have actually had.
[01:46:38.040 --> 01:46:42.746]  Certainly George Herbert Walker Bush has had, and the following presidents after him have had.
[01:46:43.347 --> 01:46:49.114]  And because they're in control of regulations, so as long as it's things they can control, they can get a slice of it.
[01:46:49.374 --> 01:46:51.677]  So nobody else can operate but the insiders.
[01:46:52.197 --> 01:46:54.220]  And that's why what's frightening here is in Washington,
[01:46:54.540 --> 01:47:06.368]  You actually have a few so-called self-styled libertarians and a few republicans like former Secretary of State George Shultz all pushing for a carbon tax and they're claiming it's going to be a carbon neutral carbon tax here in Washington.
[01:47:06.748 --> 01:47:20.576]  What could, what carbon neutral in Washington means they'll start a whole new tax temporarily for six months, reduce a few other taxes, get the new tax in and then six months after that jack up all the taxes and then they have a new power to tax.
[01:47:20.596 --> 01:47:21.277]  They always do.
[01:47:21.797 --> 01:47:22.658]  In closing here...
[01:47:26.852 --> 01:47:28.512]  I want to play you this CNN clip.
[01:47:28.812 --> 01:47:35.534]  For those that don't know the science, the North Pole expands and shrinks just as the South Pole does in the summers.
[01:47:35.914 --> 01:47:37.714]  And they both have summers in the opposite time.
[01:47:38.174 --> 01:47:45.476]  Anybody can go to NASA's own site and see a year time lapse of the Arctic shrinking in the summer, expanding in the winter.
[01:47:45.496 --> 01:47:47.757]  That's why for 500 years there's been a northern passage.
[01:47:48.177 --> 01:47:50.377]  Everybody knows this except, I guess, the public.
[01:47:50.617 --> 01:47:54.058]  I want to play this CNN clip from Mark Moreno of Climate Depot and ask him,
[01:47:54.398 --> 01:47:55.980]  How do they think they can get away with it?
[01:47:56.140 --> 01:47:58.163]  Then we'll go to break and come back with your calls after Mark goes.
[01:47:58.423 --> 01:48:05.852]  Here is a clip from a few days ago that I've been talking about CNN, CNN lying to their viewers.
[01:48:05.872 --> 01:48:06.272]  Here it is.
[01:48:06.372 --> 01:48:07.734]  Polar bears are the best example of it.
[01:48:07.914 --> 01:48:10.878]  They're a group of polar bears that live out their life on ice.
[01:48:11.498 --> 01:48:18.840]  As the ice has shrunk back towards the center of the Arctic Ocean, the polar bears have taken away from their food the seals that live close to the land.
[01:48:19.260 --> 01:48:23.501]  And so there's reports of malnourished and underweight polar bears and things for that ice-based group.
[01:48:23.921 --> 01:48:28.202]  But also overall too, the Arctic, the ice is what defines the Arctic overall.
[01:48:28.602 --> 01:48:36.824]  And so as you do things like change the ice, you change how much sunlight goes in the ocean, and you totally change the food chain.
[01:48:37.406 --> 01:48:40.788]  So, Tom, is there anything we can do about this to reverse this or stop this?
[01:48:42.508 --> 01:48:49.972]  You know, I think the most important thing is this, is that people have to realize that the planet isn't just changing, it's changed.
[01:48:50.052 --> 01:48:51.753]  And we need to start planning for that change.
[01:48:51.773 --> 01:48:56.235]  And we need to think about changes to water resources, sea level rise, and those kinds of things.
[01:48:56.775 --> 01:48:57.155]  All right.
[01:48:57.415 --> 01:48:58.536]  Tom Wagner, thank you so much.
[01:48:58.596 --> 01:48:59.396]  I really appreciate it.
[01:49:01.004 --> 01:49:07.628]  And then it goes on to show, that's the most important part, in every clip that I wanted, was that they, you know, they showed it shrinking.
[01:49:07.648 --> 01:49:08.588]  Look, it's all disappearing!
[01:49:08.929 --> 01:49:10.590]  And it was the shot of it in the winter.
[01:49:11.190 --> 01:49:14.632]  That's what I wanted to show that in the winter, well, in the summer.
[01:49:14.652 --> 01:49:17.574]  Okay, and very briefly.
[01:49:18.054 --> 01:49:23.137]  Arctic sea ice, first of all, is up 66-67% from last year's record low.
[01:49:23.197 --> 01:49:25.558]  And record low is only since 1979.
[01:49:25.979 --> 01:49:28.400]  This is only in the, pretty much the month of September.
[01:49:28.420 --> 01:49:29.581]  The record
[01:49:32.114 --> 01:49:40.021]  Low was put in at a time of the end of the 1970s global cooling hysteria when the Arctic probably had the most ice it had in 40 years.
[01:49:40.501 --> 01:49:44.325]  So the bottom line is Arctic ice is making a massive recovery first of all this year.
[01:49:46.406 --> 01:49:49.529]  The latest estimates of polar bears used to be up to 25,000.
[01:49:49.809 --> 01:49:52.391]  Now I've seen estimates up to 32,000.
[01:49:52.612 --> 01:49:57.476]  The numbers are increasing and this idea that polar bears are dying
[01:49:59.165 --> 01:49:59.365]  I think?
[01:50:16.892 --> 01:50:26.795]  ...the ice in the summer, which is what the CNN and others are, you know, hype with this expert, this guest they had on, doesn't affect their feeding and other things like that.
[01:50:26.815 --> 01:50:33.357]  The bottom line is polar bears, by all accounts, are thriving and throughout most of the Arctic.
[01:50:33.777 --> 01:50:40.439]  The Antarctic is at or near record sea ice extent since 1979 when satellite monitoring went there.
[01:50:40.519 --> 01:50:41.579]  Global sea ice is...
[01:50:43.058 --> 01:50:45.759]  Well above average, if you combine the North and South Poles.
[01:50:46.439 --> 01:51:02.065]  If, as Joe Bastardi, the meteorologist, said today, if the oceans shift and the Arctic starts gaining ice and the South Pole starts losing ice, suddenly the global warmers are going to turn on a dime and claim that the Southern Hemisphere now is proof of global warming.
[01:51:02.345 --> 01:51:03.486]  This is not science.
[01:51:03.506 --> 01:51:04.546]  This is astrology.
[01:51:04.826 --> 01:51:06.327]  This is, they pick anywhere on the globe.
[01:51:06.647 --> 01:51:08.368]  By the way, the wildfires, Alex,
[01:51:09.368 --> 01:51:13.511]  Absolutely, we're at one of the record low years for wildfires this year.
[01:51:13.551 --> 01:51:14.792]  Same thing for tornadoes.
[01:51:14.912 --> 01:51:18.574]  Al Gore says that there's now level 6 hurricanes.
[01:51:18.614 --> 01:51:19.315]  That's not a lie.
[01:51:19.735 --> 01:51:31.202]  And then the Washington Post claimed, well, we may not have quoted him directly, but they haven't released the transcript, they haven't released the audio that I'm aware of, but they circled the wagon that protected Gore from another idiotic statement.
[01:51:31.222 --> 01:51:31.782]  Amazing.
[01:51:31.823 --> 01:51:33.063]  Well, thank God you're out there.

[01:55:09.087 --> 01:55:26.437]  Folks, I was driving in the car this morning, listening to so-called conservative talk radio, and heard a national host, I'm not even going to mention, but I know a lot of you hear the similar stuff, say, hey, we shouldn't let Obama attack Syria.
[01:55:28.271 --> 01:55:31.834]  Openly, because we got two different groups of bad guys killing each other!
[01:55:32.355 --> 01:55:33.015]  This is great!
[01:55:33.095 --> 01:55:34.977]  Well, that's actually what this whole plan was about.
[01:55:35.357 --> 01:55:39.341]  Break the country in two, de-industrialize it, and then wonder why they hate us.
[01:55:41.923 --> 01:55:49.648]  Syria is a secular-run government that was becoming more and more pro-West and trying to democratize, and that's the big no-no.
[01:55:50.229 --> 01:55:55.232]  And our government put the worst al-Qaeda in, who are at least ten times worse than Assad.
[01:55:55.492 --> 01:56:03.238]  By the way, next hour we have big breaking news in the next 20 minutes that's in official Syrian statements, but has not been picked up in U.S.
[01:56:03.278 --> 01:56:03.598]  media.
[01:56:05.199 --> 01:56:07.621]  It will be breaking in 20 minutes at Infowars.com.
[01:56:10.220 --> 01:56:16.384]  And at the bottom of the hour, I'm going to have one of our reporters in to go over this with us on air.
[01:56:16.404 --> 01:56:18.726]  But I'll go to Aaron and Robert and Mike and L.A.
[01:56:18.786 --> 01:56:23.629]  and Tate and everybody else that's holding when we start the next hour here in just a few minutes.
[01:56:23.689 --> 01:56:28.773]  But I just have a sense of justice and I get scared for my family.
[01:56:29.687 --> 01:56:32.049]  Like, you call it luck, what comes around goes around.
[01:56:32.069 --> 01:56:36.412]  I don't believe in karma so much in the Hindu way or the Buddhist way or whatever.
[01:56:37.053 --> 01:56:40.596]  As much as I've seen in life, you do bad stuff, bad things happen to you.
[01:56:41.937 --> 01:56:43.418]  And I've seen it happen to other people.
[01:56:43.498 --> 01:56:47.321]  Man, it's not just that I'm like evil and don't want to do bad things, this comes back on me.
[01:56:47.621 --> 01:56:49.743]  I also don't want to do bad stuff.
[01:56:49.763 --> 01:56:52.365]  I mean, can you imagine just, oh, let them kill everybody in Syria.
[01:56:52.385 --> 01:56:53.966]  It's just brown people killing each other.
[01:56:54.687 --> 01:56:57.009]  What in the world is going on with that?
[01:56:58.652 --> 01:57:01.615]  And I see, you know, so-called minority groups going, yeah, blow up Assad.
[01:57:01.655 --> 01:57:03.777]  It's like, as long as it's a foreigner, let's kill him.
[01:57:03.797 --> 01:57:04.958]  It's not about Assad.
[01:57:05.218 --> 01:57:11.364]  It's about a country that wouldn't do anything, that the West is trying to overthrow and put the worst people in the world, Al-Qaeda.
[01:57:11.845 --> 01:57:13.587]  I mean, they are just nasty folks.
[01:57:14.347 --> 01:57:16.029]  I can't believe I have to explain this to people.
[01:57:16.089 --> 01:57:17.791]  I know our general audience understands it.
[01:57:19.403 --> 01:57:20.864]  It is like a Twilight Zone episode.
[01:57:21.064 --> 01:57:24.966]  The good news is the alternative media has gotten this narrative out the last two and a half years.
[01:57:25.026 --> 01:57:26.066]  The truth about Al-Qaeda.
[01:57:26.387 --> 01:57:27.107]  Now everybody knows.
[01:57:27.187 --> 01:57:28.288]  Congress is talking about it.
[01:57:28.628 --> 01:57:30.109]  Mainstream news is talking about it.
[01:57:30.529 --> 01:57:31.809]  Why are we funding Al-Qaeda?
[01:57:32.310 --> 01:57:34.611]  So this shows a major setback for them.
[01:57:34.631 --> 01:57:35.992]  But that big breaking news is coming up.
[01:57:37.132 --> 01:57:46.995]  Speaking of the shutdown, folks, the paper in Austin brags that it's good that we pay double and they had the mayor in there saying it's good for the earth for us to pay more.
[01:57:47.395 --> 01:57:48.695]  Teaches us not to use as much.
[01:57:49.315 --> 01:57:53.536]  These are people fat on insider deals and all sorts of crud.
[01:57:53.556 --> 01:57:54.577]  I mean, it is disgusting.
[01:57:54.797 --> 01:57:57.838]  They are feudal lords who want you poor.
[01:57:57.898 --> 01:57:58.918]  They are scum.
[01:57:59.818 --> 01:58:02.659]  And they're all over the country, and you need to read Behind the Green Mask.
[01:58:03.079 --> 01:58:07.221]  You need to get it.
[01:58:08.061 --> 01:58:10.002]  You need to buy 10 copies.
[01:58:10.342 --> 01:58:11.643]  It also supports our broadcast.
[01:58:11.943 --> 01:58:15.544]  And give them to your county commissioners, your city council, your police chief.
[01:58:15.924 --> 01:58:17.165]  So it's an easy read.
[01:58:17.185 --> 01:58:20.206]  160-something pages long.
[01:58:20.406 --> 01:58:21.226]  168 pages long.
[01:58:21.666 --> 01:58:25.388]  And it's dead on, dead on, dead on.

[01:58:36.127 --> 01:58:37.388]  Knowledge is power.
[01:58:37.428 --> 01:58:39.971]  Get my film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[01:58:40.011 --> 01:58:43.394]  Give it to them along with this, the DVD, with the expanded extras.
[01:58:44.435 --> 01:58:53.164]  And then protect yourself from these eugenicists who love putting hundreds of chemicals in the water, not just fluoride, and then watching the USIQ drop, and then writing best-selling books.
[01:58:53.184 --> 01:58:55.166]  The White House science czar bragging how he did it.
[01:58:55.786 --> 01:58:58.249]  In 1974, he wrote a book about it, The Year I Was Born.
[01:58:59.782 --> 01:59:00.463]  Ecoscience.
[01:59:00.903 --> 01:59:04.906]  Get a ProPure, the best gravity-fed system, what I and my family use.

[01:59:06.448 --> 01:59:07.769]  Side-by-side comparisons.
[01:59:07.849 --> 01:59:08.970]  There's a lot of claims out there.
[01:59:09.330 --> 01:59:10.291]  Check it out for yourself.
[01:59:11.012 --> 01:59:11.892]  See it to believe it.
[01:59:11.932 --> 01:59:13.073]  Cuts out the glyphosate.

[02:01:11.723 --> 02:01:15.807]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:01:27.170 --> 02:01:30.081]  Folks, we have big breaking news on the Syria situation.
[02:01:30.121 --> 02:01:33.433]  We have the actual details of it coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[02:01:34.744 --> 02:01:38.186]  But here it is breaking right now, partially, at Reuters.
[02:01:39.007 --> 02:01:41.849]  Syria says terrorists will strike Europe with chemical weapons.
[02:01:42.329 --> 02:01:47.953]  Syria's Deputy Foreign Minister said Wednesday the United States, Britain, and France helped terrorists use chemical weapons in Syria.
[02:01:48.033 --> 02:01:50.515]  That's all come out now, by the way, in the foreign press.
[02:01:50.795 --> 02:01:53.156]  And that the same groups will soon use them against Europe.
[02:01:53.557 --> 02:01:58.940]  Yes, and then the bankers will take everybody's liberty and lock up all their opposition and say the patriots did it.
[02:02:00.041 --> 02:02:02.963]  I'm telling you, Al Qaeda is the key to taking over for the New World Order.
[02:02:04.332 --> 02:02:08.356]  And then the media spins it that I'm saying Al-Qaeda doesn't exist or that Al-Qaeda isn't a threat.
[02:02:08.896 --> 02:02:10.137]  Oh, they're the big threat!
[02:02:11.358 --> 02:02:12.960]  They work for the New World Order.
[02:02:13.820 --> 02:02:15.202]  On record, I've had enough of it.
[02:02:16.122 --> 02:02:19.425]  The prime suspect in ordering the gas attack is the Secretary of State.
[02:02:20.186 --> 02:02:21.207]  I believe he gave the order.
[02:02:21.567 --> 02:02:24.190]  I've studied how the State Department works, and I know they're running the rebels.
[02:02:24.450 --> 02:02:25.511]  He would make that decision.
[02:02:27.613 --> 02:02:29.795]  You can just see Kerry in that briefing room picking the targets.
[02:02:29.875 --> 02:02:31.256]  I mean, it makes me want to throw up.
[02:02:32.472 --> 02:02:36.034]  And again, I'm not romanticizing the government over there or Assad.
[02:02:36.354 --> 02:02:38.135]  It's the people I'm romanticizing.
[02:02:38.495 --> 02:02:42.437]  It is wrong to frame a country, attack it for two and a half years, and do that.
[02:02:42.477 --> 02:02:43.498]  I said I'm going to your calls.
[02:02:43.878 --> 02:02:45.179]  We're going to go to them right now.
[02:02:45.699 --> 02:02:48.020]  Let's talk to Aaron in Nevada.
[02:02:48.421 --> 02:02:49.421]  You're on the air, Aaron.
[02:02:49.461 --> 02:02:49.781]  Welcome.
[02:02:51.542 --> 02:02:55.304]  Well, I think you have the... John is the best producer and talk radio today.
[02:02:55.324 --> 02:02:56.505]  I just want to say that up front.
[02:02:57.966 --> 02:02:58.386]  Say that again.
[02:02:58.406 --> 02:02:59.366]  Your phone was a bit overdriven.
[02:02:59.406 --> 02:03:00.007]  I have what, sir?
[02:03:01.791 --> 02:03:04.873]  John is the best producer and talk radio today in my opinion.
[02:03:05.614 --> 02:03:07.435]  Well, let me just give credit where it's all due.
[02:03:07.775 --> 02:03:10.056]  Everybody kind of comes up with ideas for what to cover.
[02:03:10.296 --> 02:03:17.381]  I mean, producers, and I'm not stealing John's thunder, he does an incredible job on the nightly news and actually helps produce that more than even this show.
[02:03:17.781 --> 02:03:18.982]  And John does do a great job.
[02:03:19.402 --> 02:03:22.144]  Technically, people think of producers in movies.
[02:03:22.984 --> 02:03:24.266]  As the person that pays for it.
[02:03:24.326 --> 02:03:29.191]  So then always at AXS TV, whoever I had running the show, people would go to them like they were my boss.
[02:03:29.211 --> 02:03:30.312]  Well, this is who pays for the show.
[02:03:30.552 --> 02:03:32.014]  They didn't get what that producer meant.
[02:03:32.314 --> 02:03:34.877]  A radio producer actually decides what to put on and stuff.
[02:03:35.377 --> 02:03:40.783]  And so technically, because I've already been offered jobs where I would have a producer over me, I am the producer.
[02:03:41.083 --> 02:03:43.265]  I guess you would call them associate producers.
[02:03:43.966 --> 02:03:45.147]  They come up with, you know, guests.
[02:03:45.167 --> 02:03:45.728]  What do you think of this?
[02:03:45.748 --> 02:03:46.909]  What do you think of that?
[02:03:46.949 --> 02:03:48.950]  And I'm actually trying to get them to do more producing.
[02:03:48.990 --> 02:03:52.594]  They kind of, you know, like want to be honorable and just say, oh Alex, you decide what to do.
[02:03:52.634 --> 02:03:54.315]  But they are all producing.
[02:03:54.335 --> 02:03:55.656]  They're all associate producing.
[02:03:55.976 --> 02:03:58.178]  But John Bowne does a great job as a reporter as well.
[02:03:58.218 --> 02:03:58.479]  Go ahead.
[02:03:59.918 --> 02:04:03.782]  Well, I meant John Harman.
[02:04:03.802 --> 02:04:06.284]  Oh no, John Harman is at the Satellite Uplink place.
[02:04:07.225 --> 02:04:08.046]  He just went, ahh.
[02:04:08.546 --> 02:04:12.129]  And John Harman, who I've worked with for 10 years, does do a fabulous job.
[02:04:12.470 --> 02:04:14.772]  In fact, I probably wouldn't even be on Genesis.
[02:04:15.232 --> 02:04:17.234]  Even though Genesis is great, I would just syndicate myself.
[02:04:17.274 --> 02:04:17.835]  What's the point?
[02:04:18.936 --> 02:04:24.120]  If I wasn't friends with Ted for so long, and if I didn't like John being up there as a backup.
[02:04:24.141 --> 02:04:25.502]  So yes, John Harman is great as well.
[02:04:26.564 --> 02:04:27.812]  World War III could be happening.
[02:04:27.832 --> 02:04:29.644]  We're talking about people behind the scenes, but that's fine.
[02:04:31.049 --> 02:04:40.996]  With respect to the topic Syria, I think this is about American and British Zionists wanting to settle the Golan matter in the macro.
[02:04:41.657 --> 02:04:48.842]  Second thing is, I want to break here, India is going to pledge its 500 tons of gold to the Fed for two reasons.
[02:04:48.982 --> 02:04:50.603]  One, to stop the rupee falling.
[02:04:51.244 --> 02:04:55.287]  And secondly, to get their most favored nation status back.
[02:04:55.407 --> 02:04:57.128]  It's in limbo right now since June.
[02:04:57.168 --> 02:04:58.409]  So I just want to say those two things.
[02:04:59.049 --> 02:05:02.411]  And I got questions for you, Jones, and I want answers right now.
[02:05:03.151 --> 02:05:03.451]  Okay.
[02:05:05.812 --> 02:05:07.974]  Why didn't you cover Stratford, Bilderberg?
[02:05:08.654 --> 02:05:11.775]  And are you still a supporter of the State of Israel?
[02:05:11.815 --> 02:05:15.297]  Are you taking a different position since that one recording we have on YouTube of you?
[02:05:16.218 --> 02:05:18.979]  Well, number one, I mean, you're calling it all arrogant, and I appreciate your call.
[02:05:19.419 --> 02:05:27.163]  I said, like, 16 years ago that I supported the State of Israel existing because the United Nations was saying it shouldn't exist.
[02:05:28.857 --> 02:05:32.938]  Now, I would like to have a one-state type situation if people could live in harmony.
[02:05:32.958 --> 02:05:35.119]  The problem is the globalists are running with jihadis as well.
[02:05:35.479 --> 02:05:43.522]  And then, yes, there's a lot of bad forces in Israel that are being used to create global crises so the banksters can sit all above it and pick up the pieces.
[02:05:44.402 --> 02:05:52.225]  As for Stratfor at Bilderberg, I didn't know that, but it is a fun fantasy for people that I work for a group that's here in Austin.

[02:07:04.809 --> 02:07:11.194]  Listen, there is some real scum in the alarm business cashing in by locking you into long, punishing contracts.
[02:07:11.594 --> 02:07:13.555]  Not with SimpliSafe Home Security.

[02:07:55.433 --> 02:07:57.494]  It's hurricane and wildfire season again.
[02:07:57.514 --> 02:08:05.119]  Why do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year, betting their lives that the disaster won't get them?
[02:08:05.560 --> 02:08:10.223]  Hundreds of you helped eFoodsDirect ship 50,000 donated meals to the Oklahoma victims.
[02:08:10.483 --> 02:08:12.424]  The problem is we can't help everybody.
[02:08:12.664 --> 02:08:13.805]  If every one of us who
[02:08:13.985 --> 02:08:14.305]  We can.
[02:08:14.545 --> 02:08:15.786]  We'll take care of ourselves.
[02:08:16.046 --> 02:08:18.787]  We can all pitch in to take care of those who really can't.
[02:08:19.068 --> 02:08:26.871]  The new Just In Case Pack from eFoods Direct is the big brother to the 7-Day Emergency Pack designed for Oklahoma disaster donations.
[02:08:27.272 --> 02:08:33.595]  It contains a 2-month supply for 1 person, or a 1-month supply for 2 adults, or a 2-week supply for a family of 4.

[02:09:03.584 --> 02:09:07.732]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:09:08.493 --> 02:09:09.935]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:09:16.098 --> 02:09:26.724]  All right, I want to race through your phone calls, and then we're going to break down some really powerful breaking news at the bottom of the hour with a fellow that's doing reporting for Infowars.com.
[02:09:27.685 --> 02:09:30.366]  And of course he runs StoryLink.com, Anthony Gucciardi.
[02:09:30.686 --> 02:09:31.647]  He does amazing work.
[02:09:32.187 --> 02:09:41.813]  He dug up and was doing more research with the Syria's Deputy Foreign Minister, saying that they have evidence that it was Western-backed rebels that launched the chemical attack.
[02:09:42.816 --> 02:09:49.460]  And that the rebels plan to attack the West, which I've been telling you, the next thing will be attack us and say Syria did it.
[02:09:50.901 --> 02:09:54.423]  And then the globalists get to fully destroy Syria and take all our rights.
[02:09:54.523 --> 02:09:55.503]  See how great that works?
[02:09:55.823 --> 02:09:57.144]  Think from the globalist perspective.
[02:09:57.644 --> 02:09:59.125]  World Net Daily has Arab speakers.
[02:09:59.305 --> 02:10:09.011]  They went and found the videos on established Jihad sites that have been there months and in some cases years with their military attack videos, as you know they do.
[02:10:10.900 --> 02:10:15.201]  And, uh, they are there bragging that Allah Akbar firing the chemicals.
[02:10:17.742 --> 02:10:20.703]  I mean, it is amazing videos.
[02:10:21.423 --> 02:10:26.064]  And so now that came out, and while he was researching it this morning, Reuters beat us to the punch.
[02:10:26.384 --> 02:10:27.385]  So that's not just us saying it.
[02:10:27.405 --> 02:10:28.325]  It's Reuters.
[02:10:29.165 --> 02:10:35.509]  But we've got a more expanded article up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, and he's going to be adding more to it.
[02:10:35.529 --> 02:10:40.591]  It's about eight, nine paragraphs right now, but he's going to be adding some of the videos and things to that right now.
[02:10:40.631 --> 02:10:42.732]  But the Reuters story is only three paragraphs.
[02:10:42.792 --> 02:10:44.813]  My point is, we're giving you some of the background.
[02:10:45.114 --> 02:10:48.996]  By the way, Kerry's on record trying to block the UN inspectors.
[02:10:49.596 --> 02:10:51.277]  That's why they didn't go in that day.
[02:10:51.757 --> 02:10:56.520]  The so-called US, the bankers that have hijacked us, actually were holding the UN back.
[02:10:57.100 --> 02:10:58.721]  While saying Syria, did it?
[02:10:59.121 --> 02:11:01.463]  I mean, these guys are dastardly villains.
[02:11:02.243 --> 02:11:02.984]  And I'll make a deal.
[02:11:03.004 --> 02:11:13.530]  You know, when we beat the New World Order and all this, if there were ever real people, you know, actually overthrowing dictators and putting something better in, I would be at least verbally supportive.
[02:11:13.590 --> 02:11:17.832]  It's unconstitutional to go over there and give them weapons, but I wouldn't try to stop them.
[02:11:18.112 --> 02:11:20.754]  People have a right to throw off tyranny like our forbearers have done.
[02:11:21.274 --> 02:11:22.895]  Like my ancestors did in 1776 and in 1836 as well.
[02:11:26.477 --> 02:11:28.558]  I had family on both sides in both wars for liberty.
[02:11:29.058 --> 02:11:32.479]  I get that, but this is not replace the Redcoats with something better.
[02:11:32.519 --> 02:11:35.359]  This is replace the Redcoats with Al Qaeda.
[02:11:35.739 --> 02:11:36.880]  And I just do not support it.
[02:11:37.500 --> 02:11:45.502]  I want to go back to your phone calls right now, but that story's up on PrisonPlanet.com and up on InfoWars.com right now.
[02:11:45.882 --> 02:11:49.643]  Syria, US-aided terrorist and chemical attack.
[02:11:49.963 --> 02:11:50.623]  You're up next.
[02:11:50.683 --> 02:11:52.284]  That is bombshell.
[02:11:53.044 --> 02:11:55.327]  And our media is actually using this as an excuse to attack.
[02:11:55.788 --> 02:12:00.835]  Oh, Israel says the terrorists that Assad has are going to nerve gas Europe now.
[02:12:00.855 --> 02:12:02.537]  Oh, there's going to be terror attacks.
[02:12:02.797 --> 02:12:08.966]  When you hear Israel, that means the war hawks in there that want to distract from their political problems and sell weapon systems.
[02:12:09.901 --> 02:12:12.802]  All over the world, just like our war hawks here, same deal.
[02:12:13.242 --> 02:12:14.803]  It's these globalists stand to gain.
[02:12:15.603 --> 02:12:34.290]  Nobody's the bad guy, not even the Saudi Arabian people, not the Israeli people, not the Syrian people, not the American people, not the Russian people, not the Chinese people, not the Mexican people, not the Chilean people, not the Brazilian people, not the Nigerians or South Africans or the Iraqis.
[02:12:34.450 --> 02:12:37.651]  It is technocrats that know how to manipulate people.
[02:12:38.231 --> 02:12:40.973]  Who cheat in the game of life to play us off?
[02:12:41.233 --> 02:12:48.677]  The answer is teach everyone how manipulation works, as the old parables would do for children, and teach wisdom.
[02:12:48.697 --> 02:12:54.260]  That's why the old-timers didn't trust big government, didn't trust big banks, didn't trust sharp-dressed, slick-talking people.
[02:12:54.580 --> 02:13:00.724]  Only trusted folks they'd done business with for 20, 30 years, and then you'd get an introduction from people going,
[02:13:01.064 --> 02:13:02.448]  Hey, you've known me for 30 years?
[02:13:02.849 --> 02:13:03.972]  This guy can be trusted.
[02:13:04.192 --> 02:13:09.727]  And if that guy couldn't be trusted then, you'd probably never be invited back into business again!
[02:13:11.220 --> 02:13:16.364]  But all that common sense is gone, you got a bunch of lemmings and con artists and scammers everywhere.
[02:13:16.604 --> 02:13:19.467]  I mean, the general public, folks, is degenerate.
[02:13:19.807 --> 02:13:20.588]  A good third of them.
[02:13:20.968 --> 02:13:35.180]  The other third or so are totally stupid, and out of the other third, you got maybe 10% that are psychopathic or sociopathic parasite types, and then 90% of that third, you know, that are good patriots that are awake, but we just get laughed at by the dumbed-down jellyfish.
[02:13:36.345 --> 02:13:42.888]  Because to them, it's like, it's easier intellectually just to laugh at us than to admit they've been conned and join the human species.
[02:13:43.808 --> 02:13:44.728]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[02:13:44.768 --> 02:13:46.109]  Mike in Colorado, thanks for holding.
[02:13:46.369 --> 02:13:49.790]  Then L.A., Tate, Robert and Bob and others.
[02:13:49.831 --> 02:13:51.071]  Go ahead, Mike, thanks for holding.
[02:13:51.631 --> 02:13:52.231]  Hey, you're welcome.
[02:13:52.271 --> 02:13:53.232]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:13:53.432 --> 02:13:56.553]  Your analysis is spot on and the radio here agrees with you.
[02:13:57.053 --> 02:14:03.036]  My question is, doesn't this look like the only way to keep the dollar from completely collapsing is to have a world war?
[02:14:04.102 --> 02:14:06.803]  And again, what affiliate are you listening to when you say the local host?
[02:14:06.843 --> 02:14:07.263]  Agree with me.
[02:14:08.164 --> 02:14:10.165]  Oh, it's 710 KNUS.
[02:14:10.185 --> 02:14:11.725]  Yeah, great folks up there.
[02:14:11.745 --> 02:14:16.127]  We've got a couple of good affiliates in Colorado as the communists try to take the state over.
[02:14:16.187 --> 02:14:16.907]  What a shame.
[02:14:17.588 --> 02:14:18.928]  But we thank that affiliate there.
[02:14:20.049 --> 02:14:20.269]  Look,
[02:14:21.570 --> 02:14:26.754]  But it's not, actually they're already devaluing all the currencies and slowly devaluing.
[02:14:27.635 --> 02:14:30.237]  The globalists can prop up the dollar anytime they wanted.
[02:14:30.738 --> 02:14:42.548]  They are bringing in a world financial meltdown designed, according to my own research and all the other top economists out there that have a track record of being accurate, they're already devaluing everything in concert.
[02:14:43.349 --> 02:14:47.913]  Okay, you know, one goes down faster than another, than one rises, but still overall
[02:14:49.119 --> 02:14:52.061]  The dollar's lost 99% of its value since 1913.
[02:14:52.742 --> 02:14:54.283]  And most of that's in the last decade.
[02:14:54.703 --> 02:14:56.965]  So it's accelerating, basically.
[02:14:57.445 --> 02:14:58.806]  Or the last two decades, to be technical.
[02:14:58.826 --> 02:15:03.389]  But it's accelerating like a rocket ship going to light speed.
[02:15:03.630 --> 02:15:07.392]  It's going faster and faster now, exponentially hurtling forward.
[02:15:08.553 --> 02:15:12.096]  And there's a lot of things they could do to stabilize the dollar.
[02:15:12.356 --> 02:15:14.478]  But that wouldn't transfer power to them.
[02:15:14.958 --> 02:15:15.638]  But I agree
[02:15:17.031 --> 02:15:23.613]  You would think a war would hurt the dollar, but short term it'll actually help it, many analysts say, but you see it hurting stock markets.
[02:15:23.953 --> 02:15:27.975]  So then there's other forces, even within the establishment, that are countervailing.
[02:15:28.015 --> 02:15:28.895]  It's gyrating.
[02:15:30.376 --> 02:15:31.976]  Again, there's not a world government yet.
[02:15:32.076 --> 02:15:34.337]  It's not all synchronized yet.
[02:15:34.657 --> 02:15:36.538]  They're trying to get synchronization.
[02:15:36.938 --> 02:15:38.498]  They always call for an end to gridlock.
[02:15:38.939 --> 02:15:39.779]  We need gridlock.
[02:15:40.199 --> 02:15:43.160]  Gridlock is good to keep these criminals from getting stuff passed.
[02:15:43.760 --> 02:15:44.881]  But, I mean, give me your take, sir.
[02:15:44.901 --> 02:15:45.921]  I don't want to just rant at you.
[02:15:46.624 --> 02:15:55.703]  No, I agree, but I think it's going to transition everybody to the SDR, and if that's the case, this war is probably a foregone conclusion, which is really a bummer in my opinion.
[02:15:57.682 --> 02:16:04.447]  Absolutely, and a war like this, the last time they had a world war, the dollar became the world reserve currency, and then Bretton Woods happened.
[02:16:06.029 --> 02:16:13.874]  They are moving at Davos, like the public Bilderberg meeting, to phase out of the dollar into the SDR, which private banks will then control the globe.
[02:16:14.215 --> 02:16:19.919]  They won't even need carbon taxes then to take over, but they want them to selectively shut down whoever they want.
[02:16:20.399 --> 02:16:23.661]  Carbon taxes are a purely discriminatory system.
[02:16:24.582 --> 02:16:30.787]  But again, we only think of black and white as the only way of discrimination when there's a thousand other flavors that no one's ever thought about.
[02:16:30.827 --> 02:16:32.209]  God bless you, I appreciate your call.
[02:16:33.029 --> 02:16:35.532]  Let's talk to Tate in Michigan.
[02:16:35.812 --> 02:16:36.733]  Tate, you're on the air.
[02:16:37.540 --> 02:16:41.565]  Hey Alex, I normally only call when I disagree or have something to add, but this time you nailed it.
[02:16:41.825 --> 02:16:56.484]  And the neo-fascist globalists, I believe, have seized control of the United States Federal Reserve System, and they're using the United States to wage a war of conquest using the Sunni, the Wahhabi, the Jihadi mercenaries to destabilize the Middle East.
[02:16:57.170 --> 02:17:05.354]  Well, I mean, it's, it's, God bless you, I appreciate your call, but it's not hard to nail the target when it's a trillion pound elephant five feet in front of you.
[02:17:05.374 --> 02:17:06.014]  I mean, it's just
[02:17:23.667 --> 02:17:27.968]  All out there in the open, but this propaganda targets a public that doesn't pay attention.
[02:17:29.709 --> 02:17:30.989]  Oh, like Assad, chemical.
[02:17:31.009 --> 02:17:31.929]  It's actually four times.
[02:17:32.329 --> 02:17:33.290]  Assad, chemical.
[02:17:33.330 --> 02:17:34.090]  Assad, chemical.
[02:17:34.130 --> 02:17:34.770]  Assad, chemical.
[02:17:35.210 --> 02:17:36.571]  Oh, Assad, bad man, chemical.
[02:17:36.911 --> 02:17:42.652]  Kill him for the children, not knowing it'll kill hundreds of times conservatively to have a full-blown invasion.
[02:17:43.953 --> 02:17:52.475]  But that same law's kicked in here, because over and over again they've seen the globalists caught lying about WMDs and stuff, so now they don't believe a word they say.
[02:17:53.291 --> 02:17:56.913]  You see, there's that loss of confidence in the system that all the polls show.
[02:17:57.353 --> 02:17:58.994]  In the media, the government, all of it.
[02:17:59.014 --> 02:18:00.835]  So, it's a crazy time, brother.
[02:18:01.576 --> 02:18:04.217]  Let's talk to Robert in Missouri.
[02:18:04.257 --> 02:18:04.797]  Welcome, sir.
[02:18:06.558 --> 02:18:06.778]  Alex.
[02:18:07.099 --> 02:18:07.439]  Hey, buddy.
[02:18:08.839 --> 02:18:14.162]  Hey, I wanted to talk about Vladimir Putin being the wild card in this whole situation.
[02:18:14.182 --> 02:18:16.904]  I think, look,
[02:18:18.044 --> 02:18:27.550]  You hear about all this stuff, especially like from Steve Quayle, who you haven't had on in a while, about how there's all these Russians here doing these joint operations with American troops, this and that.
[02:18:28.111 --> 02:18:35.416]  And then you got these people, other people in the alternative media, they want to lionize Vladimir Putin like he's the savior of humanity.
[02:18:35.956 --> 02:18:44.522]  But if you remember back when Dmitry Medvedev was president of Russia, he got caught off mic with Obama, and Obama was saying,
[02:18:45.382 --> 02:18:49.108]  Well, after I get re-elected, I'll have more freedom, etc., etc.
[02:18:49.709 --> 02:18:53.355]  So, we gotta look at Putin to possibly stab us in the back.
[02:18:53.456 --> 02:18:54.337]  Absolutely right.
[02:18:55.684 --> 02:19:09.368]  There's so many Russian troops possibly operating here, and then you hear about all this door-to-door book sales thing going on with people with Slavic accents, and I'm thinking somehow that we might have a domestic situation happening here.
[02:19:09.688 --> 02:19:21.132]  Well, listen, most of the people in Israel are from the Eastern Bloc or Russia, so a lot of those are Israelis going around doing the book sales, and it has turned out a lot of them actually are auxiliary Mossad agents.
[02:19:21.612 --> 02:19:24.033]  That's actually come out in the news, but there's also Russians as well.
[02:19:24.893 --> 02:19:27.514]  You've got the different power blocks investing with each other.
[02:19:28.014 --> 02:19:30.894]  You've got the West trying to take over Russia, a fifth column there.
[02:19:31.355 --> 02:19:33.715]  You've got Russia going, sure, we'll do inspections.
[02:19:34.055 --> 02:19:35.176]  That's all part of treaties.
[02:19:35.736 --> 02:19:37.616]  But everybody's eyeing each other.
[02:19:37.716 --> 02:19:39.196]  Everybody's targeting each other.
[02:19:39.497 --> 02:19:41.077]  The globalists don't trust each other.
[02:19:41.337 --> 02:19:42.717]  There's no honor among thieves.
[02:19:43.077 --> 02:19:44.698]  So I don't lionize Putin.
[02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:51.263]  I've had people, you know, that won't even come on this show anymore because I won't lionize Putin.
[02:19:52.383 --> 02:19:53.564]  And, I mean, I'm not an idiot.
[02:19:54.024 --> 02:19:55.464]  I don't lionize any of these people.
[02:19:55.745 --> 02:20:03.188]  The point is the Russian tyranny can't get its act together, and they're not the ones shutting down my power plants, opening my borders up and trying to take my guns.
[02:20:03.588 --> 02:20:07.510]  The New World Order is my front and center enemy, who's also funding Al-Qaeda.
[02:20:08.010 --> 02:20:10.536]  So they can run around and try to destabilize Russia and everybody else.
[02:20:11.097 --> 02:20:16.428]  So my whole issue is, to me Russia is a threat because the globalists may push them into nuking people.
[02:20:17.330 --> 02:20:25.476]  Uh, so, but absolutely, this worship of Pootie Poot, as Bush called him that I see everywhere, I don't think is healthy.
[02:20:25.857 --> 02:20:31.281]  I mean, he's more respectable because he is a former, you know, killer for the KGB, and he does do a lot of stuff.
[02:20:31.301 --> 02:20:32.422]  It's not just him grandstanding.
[02:20:32.442 --> 02:20:35.504]  He's a macho, you know, former KGB killer.
[02:20:35.524 --> 02:20:40.108]  So, I mean, that's kind of cooler than Obama, you know, some fake, you know, foppish,
[02:20:40.848 --> 02:20:43.089]  Teleprompter reading, you know, garbage head.
[02:20:43.569 --> 02:20:46.629]  And people hate the New World Order, and they rightfully should hate it more than Russia.
[02:20:46.969 --> 02:20:49.150]  But that doesn't mean that we should be in lovey-dovey.
[02:20:49.390 --> 02:20:50.330]  People tend to choose.
[02:20:50.350 --> 02:20:51.791]  You know, I want this or I want that.
[02:20:51.811 --> 02:20:52.831]  How about we choose none of them?
[02:20:52.851 --> 02:20:54.511]  How about we choose George Washington?

[02:21:59.485 --> 02:22:01.626]  I want you to know some very important information.
[02:22:02.506 --> 02:22:10.848]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.

[02:23:23.619 --> 02:23:24.660]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:23:24.740 --> 02:23:29.064]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:23:29.204 --> 02:23:34.848]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:23:34.948 --> 02:23:37.050]  Gold has outperformed paper investments yet.
[02:23:37.110 --> 02:23:38.291]  No word about IRAs.
[02:23:38.531 --> 02:23:41.093]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:23:41.193 --> 02:23:46.017]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:23:46.157 --> 02:23:46.398]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:23:46.458 --> 02:23:47.779]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:23:53.632 --> 02:24:00.594]  There's a huge and hushed up conspiracy going on that's about to turn your lives upside down in the coming few months.
[02:24:01.134 --> 02:24:04.215]  Unbelievably, the media are keeping quiet about this.
[02:24:04.835 --> 02:24:10.637]  I'm sure they know it, but they probably know that revealing it on TV will generate mass hysteria and chaos.
[02:24:11.513 --> 02:24:22.060]  But I believe you should be informed about it, because when the sinister agenda is finally accomplished and everything unravels, only those who know this secret info will survive and thrive.
[02:24:22.740 --> 02:24:26.903]  Go to 123conspiracy.com right now to see the truth.
[02:24:27.643 --> 02:24:35.805]  The video at 123conspiracy.com reveals the real, secret reason why Obama is after your guns and ammo.
[02:24:36.305 --> 02:24:39.746]  And it's not just in response to mass murders or preparing for war.
[02:24:40.166 --> 02:24:42.127]  It's something much darker.
[02:24:42.607 --> 02:24:47.908]  Go watch the video now at 123conspiracy.com before they shut it down.
[02:24:48.288 --> 02:24:49.628]  Again, that's 123conspiracy.com.
[02:25:06.256 --> 02:25:08.979]  You can run on for a long time.
[02:25:09.720 --> 02:25:11.481]  Run on for a long time.
[02:25:11.561 --> 02:25:12.683]  Run on for a long time.
[02:25:13.203 --> 02:25:14.805]  Until a bioweapon gets out.
[02:25:15.505 --> 02:25:21.851]  Until a nuclear weapon detonates and every country releases on each other and 40,000 nukes go off in less than an hour.
[02:25:24.017 --> 02:25:34.239]  You can go on for a long time until the public discovers that criminals in our government are running Al-Qaeda to use it to destabilize the world, including the West, to take our liberties so they can pose as saviors.
[02:25:34.779 --> 02:25:37.940]  Your calls are coming up after the break, but I want to get to a few of these clips now.
[02:25:38.820 --> 02:25:46.582]  To put it in context, I've got a new clip here, but first I want to air a short clip of John Kerry from two days ago saying, it doesn't matter who did the chemicals.
[02:25:47.702 --> 02:25:50.963]  And now we learned he blocked the UN from going and investigating.
[02:25:52.042 --> 02:25:54.243]  Because they knew they'd find out it was his guys.
[02:25:54.963 --> 02:26:02.064]  When you realize the State Department's running outside of Congress and the Pentagon this operation, that's the leader of the rebels is John Kerry.
[02:26:02.325 --> 02:26:02.745]  Technically.
[02:26:03.965 --> 02:26:05.725]  And very good chance he called the shots.
[02:26:06.746 --> 02:26:09.386]  I mean, just think of the absurdistness of that.
[02:26:09.846 --> 02:26:15.508]  I likened it to Hitler running the Nuremberg trials or Al Capone being the judge in his own trial.
[02:26:18.049 --> 02:26:24.231]  You know, Jeffrey Dahmer, if you have a press conference, and said we've got to stop the guy kidnapping, you know, adolescents and eating them in the area.
[02:26:24.251 --> 02:26:28.012]  And he's got, you know, dead kids and see-through barrels right to his left and right.
[02:26:28.493 --> 02:26:32.194]  I mean, this is so over-the-top sick, I can't even compute it.
[02:26:32.494 --> 02:26:33.274]  Let's go to that clip.
[02:26:33.774 --> 02:26:34.295]  The U.N.
[02:26:34.335 --> 02:26:38.656]  investigation will not determine who used these chemical weapons.
[02:26:38.676 --> 02:26:39.436]  You sure hope not.
[02:26:39.756 --> 02:26:42.537]  Only whether such weapons were used.
[02:26:43.098 --> 02:26:43.178]  Oh.
[02:26:43.438 --> 02:26:46.739]  A judgment that is already clear to the world.
[02:26:47.679 --> 02:26:47.919]  Yeah.
[02:26:47.979 --> 02:26:50.641]  I spoke on Thursday with Syrian Prime Minister Nour.
[02:26:51.042 --> 02:26:51.522]  That's enough.
[02:26:51.542 --> 02:26:53.483]  Alright, let's go to the next clip.
[02:26:54.644 --> 02:26:59.408]  Because this dovetails with the new clip of Ann Coulter saying the President can do whatever he wants.
[02:27:00.188 --> 02:27:02.370]  And she also says radiation is good for you, Fukushima.
[02:27:02.390 --> 02:27:05.332]  I mean, this is... So many conservatives love this woman.
[02:27:05.352 --> 02:27:06.393]  She's not a conservative.
[02:27:06.433 --> 02:27:10.016]  She is a... She didn't used to be this bad.
[02:27:10.056 --> 02:27:11.717]  But I mean, she says it for attention.
[02:27:11.737 --> 02:27:12.357]  That much is clear.
[02:27:12.798 --> 02:27:14.299]  But I mean, she really is an authoritarian.
[02:27:15.506 --> 02:27:20.330]  And she'll say some good stuff against political correctness and stuff, but it's so bizarre, even Sean Hannity has to disagree with her.
[02:27:20.690 --> 02:27:26.916]  I mean, you know, Sean Hannity came out, by the way, I have the clips here, and was against what's happening in Syria, because I think he loves his kids.
[02:27:28.577 --> 02:27:30.679]  Glenn Beck came out and said, it's crazy, we've got to stop it.
[02:27:30.799 --> 02:27:31.300]  Good!
[02:27:31.880 --> 02:27:33.441]  Absolutely, you've got to stop it!
[02:27:35.723 --> 02:27:37.064]  I mean, this is crazy, man!
[02:27:37.325 --> 02:27:39.567]  Funding Al Qaeda to do this and kill all these Christians.
[02:27:40.387 --> 02:27:40.968]  Fair minimum.
[02:27:41.028 --> 02:27:42.389]  I'd be mad if he was killing other Muslims.
[02:27:42.429 --> 02:27:43.190]  This is wrong!
[02:27:44.500 --> 02:27:51.585]  Let's go to that clip with the Congress folks with Panetta last year saying, you gotta get an agreement to be able to go into Syria from Congress.
[02:27:51.605 --> 02:27:53.066]  He says, no, we'll get it from foreign groups.
[02:27:53.426 --> 02:27:54.707]  This is a foreign coup, folks.
[02:27:54.747 --> 02:27:55.147]  Here it is.
[02:27:55.247 --> 02:28:01.592]  Again, our goal would be to seek international permission and we would
[02:28:01.932 --> 02:28:12.329]  We would come to the Congress and inform you and determine how best to approach this, whether or not we would want to get permission from the Congress.
[02:28:12.730 --> 02:28:16.356]  I think those are issues we would have to discuss as we decide what to do here.
[02:28:17.136 --> 02:28:20.277]  Well, I'm almost breathless about that.
[02:28:20.958 --> 02:28:28.461]  Because what I heard you say is, we're going to seek international approval, and they will come and tell the Congress what we might do.
[02:28:28.581 --> 02:28:32.363]  And then he goes and says, you know, walk that back, and he goes, no, we don't need you.
[02:28:33.503 --> 02:28:33.804]  Anymore.
[02:28:34.324 --> 02:28:36.265]  And that full clip's famous, we've played it many times.
[02:28:36.805 --> 02:28:41.027]  Let's go to the next clip, this is an exchange between
[02:28:43.308 --> 02:28:47.156]  Ann Coulter and Sean Hannity last night.
[02:28:49.079 --> 02:28:53.042]  Talking about launching a war without congressional approval.
[02:28:53.142 --> 02:28:53.582]  Here it is.
[02:28:53.602 --> 02:28:54.743]  Do you agree or disagree?
[02:28:54.763 --> 02:29:08.091]  I want to talk about the hypocrisy where he said, President doesn't have the power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to this country.
[02:29:08.331 --> 02:29:08.531]  Right.
[02:29:08.791 --> 02:29:13.414]  So based on his definition, what he is going to do is unconstitutional.
[02:29:14.145 --> 02:29:15.686]  More proof that I'm right.
[02:29:16.586 --> 02:29:18.567]  Of course the Commander-in-Chief has that power.
[02:29:19.167 --> 02:29:23.468]  And it's appalling that the American people would elect that man Commander-in-Chief.
[02:29:23.788 --> 02:29:28.410]  But that having been done, look, Obama also said, oh, he's going to shut down Guantanamo.
[02:29:28.470 --> 02:29:30.471]  Are you sorry he didn't shut down Guantanamo?
[02:29:30.771 --> 02:29:33.732]  The question is the merits of this particular intervention.
[02:29:33.772 --> 02:29:35.452]  I think you were right in what you said at the beginning.
[02:29:35.472 --> 02:29:35.932]  That's enough.
[02:29:35.952 --> 02:29:37.553]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen...
[02:29:40.513 --> 02:29:50.233]  Under laws passed in the 50s for mutually assured destruction, if Congress gave the President, they gave authorization to try to
[02:29:52.259 --> 02:29:56.042]  Launch missiles to knock out the Russian missiles if they did a first launch.
[02:29:56.683 --> 02:29:58.885]  So they wouldn't have to call Congress in and get an authorization.
[02:29:59.485 --> 02:30:01.487]  That is pre-authorization.
[02:30:01.807 --> 02:30:07.112]  There is no pre-authorization for an invasion or bombardment of Syria.
[02:30:07.392 --> 02:30:08.973]  And that's what you gotta go to Congress for.
[02:30:09.414 --> 02:30:11.516]  And Ann Coulter is a smart lady and she knows that.
[02:30:11.896 --> 02:30:14.898]  And Obama, a constitutional lawyer, he knows that.
[02:30:15.299 --> 02:30:16.580]  And everybody knows that.
[02:30:16.760 --> 02:30:17.521]  But this is worse.
[02:30:18.962 --> 02:30:22.165]  Obama says they get the approval from NATO and the UN.
[02:30:23.626 --> 02:30:24.327]  That's treason.
[02:30:25.268 --> 02:30:28.731]  But now he says, because the UN won't go along with it, it's so evil.
[02:30:28.751 --> 02:30:32.475]  Because the whole world knows what's going on, 9% approval rating for this.
[02:30:32.815 --> 02:30:33.776]  He goes, I don't even need that!
[02:30:35.477 --> 02:30:36.819]  I got John McCain!
[02:30:36.899 --> 02:30:38.600]  Why don't we just make John McCain God?
[02:30:39.261 --> 02:30:40.702]  Make that piece of trash emperor?
[02:30:41.723 --> 02:30:43.084]  Everybody can groom his stool.
[02:30:44.161 --> 02:30:47.162]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:30:48.082 --> 02:30:50.923]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:55.564 --> 02:31:00.145]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[02:31:00.285 --> 02:31:03.246]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[02:31:03.406 --> 02:31:08.627]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[02:31:08.948 --> 02:31:10.548]  It all comes down to one thing.
[02:31:10.868 --> 02:31:12.209]  We are what we eat.
[02:31:12.509 --> 02:31:16.853]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[02:31:17.193 --> 02:31:21.176]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and Big Pharma runoff.
[02:31:21.416 --> 02:31:23.738]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[02:31:23.978 --> 02:31:29.903]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[02:31:59.423 --> 02:32:04.706]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[02:32:04.926 --> 02:32:12.489]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[02:32:12.670 --> 02:32:21.774]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[02:32:21.974 --> 02:32:28.980]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[02:32:29.140 --> 02:32:32.023]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[02:32:32.043 --> 02:32:38.969]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse, but demand a war.
[02:32:39.509 --> 02:32:40.450]  Oh, there's another one!
[02:32:40.510 --> 02:32:41.791]  Another plane just hit!
[02:32:55.825 --> 02:33:03.150]  Dozens of diseases ranging from the common cold and flu to MRSA and pneumonia are all caused by infectious pathogens.
[02:33:03.570 --> 02:33:07.372]  Fortunately, a simple, safe and effective alternative exists.

[02:33:56.691 --> 02:34:05.297]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[02:34:20.339 --> 02:34:24.382]  Well, the story is red-linked on InfoWars.com.
[02:34:24.422 --> 02:34:26.063]  It's also up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:34:26.083 --> 02:34:29.946]  We've sent it out on Twitter at RealAlexJones, and it's going up on our Facebook.
[02:34:30.646 --> 02:34:38.312]  It's Syria, U.S.-aided terrorist in chemical attack, and their minister says Europe is next.
[02:34:39.933 --> 02:34:51.420]  And he's also updated, and it's about to refresh, with WorldNetDaily's article from yesterday with the video of known certified Western Jihadi-backed sites loading the chemical warheads in the mortars.
[02:34:52.964 --> 02:34:56.626]  And I'm chattering about how wonderful Bin Laden is and how they're going to kill Americans next.
[02:34:57.166 --> 02:34:59.748]  Most of these videos have the most sickening Bin Laden worship.
[02:35:01.989 --> 02:35:03.250]  I mean, it makes me want to throw up.
[02:35:03.350 --> 02:35:12.515]  And then to know our government has used this to take my liberties, your liberties, gut the country, get rid of the Bill of Rights, spy on us, and they're running the terrorists publicly.
[02:35:12.875 --> 02:35:14.576]  And I think they jumped the shark here.
[02:35:15.777 --> 02:35:21.220]  And now you have a top Syrian Deputy Foreign Minister coming out
[02:35:22.199 --> 02:35:24.421]  We even have this other clip from Saudi Arabia we haven't played yet.
[02:35:24.441 --> 02:35:34.588]  We're going to play that after that press TV report with the video of the Saudi Arabian intelligence chief threatening the Russians that they're going to attack Russia with Al-Qaeda forces if they don't back out.
[02:35:34.909 --> 02:35:42.474]  I mean, this is wild how the bankers use these jihadis as their secret army and then play both sides like, oh, we're worried about Al-Qaeda.
[02:35:42.794 --> 02:35:46.177]  And then a lot of times you'll have a real jihadi who actually thinks they're fighting America.
[02:35:46.597 --> 02:35:49.760]  But up the chain, they've got a globalist boss.
[02:35:49.920 --> 02:35:50.480]  So this is...
[02:35:52.293 --> 02:35:55.874]  Big news up on Infowars.com, an explosive declaration.
[02:35:56.334 --> 02:36:07.977]  Syria's Deputy Foreign Minister has now come out on record in declaring that the U.S., Britain, and France were instrumental in aiding the chemical attacks on Syria through a network of terrorists inside the country.
[02:36:08.297 --> 02:36:09.077]  And it's not just them.
[02:36:09.417 --> 02:36:11.158]  Even World Net Daily is saying that.
[02:36:11.658 --> 02:36:21.285]  And it was the same group that even Yahoo, nine months or eight months ago, reported on, yes, and showed the evidence that, yes, they staged the chemical attack.
[02:36:22.466 --> 02:36:26.029]  Also, folks, we have Anthony Gucciardi here with StoryLeak.com.
[02:36:26.349 --> 02:36:31.153]  His great site, he's lived in Austin a few years ago, does great work with Mike Adams of NaturalNews.com as well.
[02:36:31.733 --> 02:36:35.174]  And he said, hey, you know, I ought to come in and help out as a reporter.
[02:36:35.194 --> 02:36:36.895]  I said, you know, that's the exact idea I have.
[02:36:37.175 --> 02:36:39.076]  So he's teamed up with us as well.
[02:36:39.576 --> 02:36:45.338]  Man, this is big and this is getting no attention, this Reuters report, but you went and found his full statement.
[02:36:46.338 --> 02:36:47.619]  Anthony, break this down for us.
[02:36:47.859 --> 02:36:56.323]  Exactly, so do you remember when it was a conspiracy theory to say that we were working with the Syrian rebels to actually go in and launch the chemical attack, or even working with Al-Qaeda?
[02:36:56.703 --> 02:37:04.948]  Well now we've found not only this Reuters report, but there's a bunch of other reports from the Independent as well, like, does Obama know he's fighting on Al-Qaeda's side?
[02:37:05.308 --> 02:37:07.089]  So it's now 100% admitted.
[02:37:07.209 --> 02:37:08.189]  And that's on drudge!
[02:37:08.249 --> 02:37:09.650]  That's gonna really make the globalists mad.
[02:37:09.810 --> 02:37:10.530]  Yes, exactly.
[02:37:10.650 --> 02:37:11.911]  But check out this report.
[02:37:12.251 --> 02:37:15.112]  So this one now from Reuters, the headline is actually deceptive.
[02:37:15.152 --> 02:37:21.975]  It says, it doesn't even talk about in the headline how we're actually aiding the Al-Qaeda terrorists, but it talks about how Europe is next.
[02:37:22.335 --> 02:37:35.881]  But in the first paragraph, as I report on InfoWars, and it was up on StoryLeak as well, basically what's going on is this foreign official from Syria said, not only did the US aid the Al-Qaeda terrorists who carried out these chemical attacks,
[02:37:36.181 --> 02:37:37.462]  But he went to the U.N.
[02:37:37.502 --> 02:37:40.724]  immediately and showed them all of the information and they disregarded it.
[02:37:41.004 --> 02:37:42.125]  He went straight to the U.N.
[02:37:42.305 --> 02:37:46.468]  And now we learned, Kerry said, do not look at that.
[02:37:46.508 --> 02:37:48.009]  You're ordered to not look at it.
[02:37:48.109 --> 02:37:48.909]  And now we know why.
[02:37:49.190 --> 02:37:51.131]  Boy, this is so obvious.
[02:37:51.371 --> 02:37:53.393]  It is so obvious, and let me show you something else.
[02:37:53.673 --> 02:37:58.378]  This Yahoo report from January of 2013, is this, you know, are they psychic or what?
[02:37:58.878 --> 02:38:00.299]  Check out how they reference InfoWars.
[02:38:00.359 --> 02:38:01.561]  It says, U.S.
[02:38:01.641 --> 02:38:04.423]  backed plan to launch chemical weapon attack on Syria.
[02:38:04.523 --> 02:38:06.185]  Blame it on Assad government.
[02:38:06.225 --> 02:38:07.046]  That's from Yahoo.
[02:38:07.526 --> 02:38:21.512]  Earlier this year, the Obama administration gave green signal to a chemical weapons attack plan in Syria that could be blamed on Assad's regime and in turn spur international military action in the devastated country, leaked documents have shown.
[02:38:21.552 --> 02:38:23.653]  I linked up to that article in Yahoo News.
[02:38:23.873 --> 02:38:25.573]  That's the number one website in the world.
[02:38:25.593 --> 02:38:26.454]  They just beat out Google.
[02:38:26.914 --> 02:38:36.140]  The number one trafficked website in the whole world, the biggest news site, the biggest search engine, whatever, says, U.S.-backed plan to launch chemical weapon attack on Syria.
[02:38:36.520 --> 02:38:41.663]  So now it is not only admitted, the mainstream media was forced to cover it, and that's what we call headline bombing.
[02:38:41.883 --> 02:38:53.330]  And as it turns out, it's 100% accurate, the chemical weapons attack on Syria to launch... And then the jihadis are so out of control, they videotaped themselves doing it and World Net Daily's covering it.
[02:38:54.815 --> 02:38:57.536]  How about the fact that they behead Christians as well?
[02:38:57.556 --> 02:39:04.940]  This one says they beheaded pretty much an entire village, cut off their heads with a small knife to a cheering crowd of dozens.
[02:39:05.580 --> 02:39:16.626]  So they're going and doing this and it even mentions, this is the Washington Times by the way, it says, the reported beheading of the two Christians comes about the same time America has started sending arms to the rebel fighters.
[02:39:16.986 --> 02:39:21.730]  Well, the head of Al-Qaeda has come out, Zawahiri, and praised the U.S.
[02:39:22.590 --> 02:39:27.494]  for its loving of the event and helping with the rebels and that's like mainstream news.
[02:39:28.294 --> 02:39:30.096]  You've got, I mean, this is insanity.
[02:39:30.216 --> 02:39:31.417]  Imagine how brainwashed we are.
[02:39:32.037 --> 02:39:35.683]  What happened during September 11, the boogeyman al-Qaeda terrorists were to blame.
[02:39:35.863 --> 02:39:40.230]  And now, the boogeyman al-Qaeda terrorists are our greatest allies and Syria is to blame.
[02:39:40.570 --> 02:39:42.032]  And I think we've talked about this before.
[02:39:42.092 --> 02:39:43.254]  We've entered 1984.
[02:39:43.354 --> 02:39:46.519]  We have entered 1984, but Syria is a distraction almost.
[02:39:46.579 --> 02:39:47.500]  It's about the Russians.
[02:39:47.941 --> 02:39:50.143]  The Russians are launching a hot war on the U.S.
[02:39:50.183 --> 02:39:54.426]  and we're actually instigating it because Russia is supporting Assad and we are supporting Syrian rebels.
[02:39:54.726 --> 02:39:56.247]  This is much greater than Syria.
[02:39:56.527 --> 02:40:14.000]  Syria is an issue and we don't want the war because it will turn into World War III, but it's really a distraction from this ultimate, hot, incendiary World War III scenario because when we go in and we have Israel blow up the Russian missile caches and then say it wasn't them and ultimately it comes out through CNN that it was them, according to U.S.
[02:40:14.080 --> 02:40:16.702]  intel officers who don't want World War III to happen,
[02:40:17.242 --> 02:40:18.583]  Now we see it's a hot scenario.
[02:40:18.963 --> 02:40:20.924]  So it's ultimately going to build to World War III.
[02:40:20.964 --> 02:40:21.964]  Let me ask this question.
[02:40:22.064 --> 02:40:27.847]  Why do some elements in the US, Europe, France especially wants this, and Israel, some elements in Israel?
[02:40:28.307 --> 02:40:30.027]  I mean, it really is madness.
[02:40:30.088 --> 02:40:31.328]  But it's the same question.
[02:40:31.388 --> 02:40:36.510]  Why did John Corzine make 40 to 1 bets against other people's money?
[02:40:36.550 --> 02:40:37.951]  I mean, they're crazy people.
[02:40:38.331 --> 02:40:39.212]  They control people.
[02:40:39.252 --> 02:40:41.754]  We can go to actually something called Codex Alimentarius.
[02:40:42.174 --> 02:40:47.538]  How that works is the health group, the largest health group in the world, where they vote on what supplements you're allowed to take and everything like that.
[02:40:47.818 --> 02:40:48.599]  And how the U.S.
[02:40:48.679 --> 02:40:53.903]  works is they bully these small islands and everything like that to vote in favor of the U.S., including France and the U.K.
[02:40:53.923 --> 02:40:54.643]  and everything like that.
[02:40:54.663 --> 02:40:54.904]  That's right.
[02:40:54.924 --> 02:40:55.224]  That's right.
[02:40:55.284 --> 02:41:00.148]  Criminal elements in our government and the State Department, on record, get all the third world countries to outvote.
[02:41:01.152 --> 02:41:02.873]  Our American Congress and the rest of it.
[02:41:02.973 --> 02:41:03.494]  It's incredible.
[02:41:03.654 --> 02:41:09.838]  I have insiders inside Codex, the only one authorized in the United States of America, and he goes in and he says that basically what the U.S.
[02:41:09.858 --> 02:41:11.960]  does is if they don't go along with the U.S.
[02:41:11.980 --> 02:41:13.721]  program, they threaten them with trade wars.
[02:41:13.981 --> 02:41:20.286]  So they say, if you don't agree with us on allowing aspartame to be in food or whatever it is, then we're going to go ahead and launch trade wars against you.
[02:41:20.526 --> 02:41:24.247]  We're going to put sanctions on you and ultimately destroy your economy.
[02:41:24.647 --> 02:41:25.767]  This is bullying.
[02:41:25.987 --> 02:41:28.008]  This is what's going to lead to World War III.
[02:41:28.028 --> 02:41:31.488]  Because as you see in that report over there from Reuters, not just the U.S.
[02:41:31.568 --> 02:41:34.449]  aided these Al-Qaeda terrorists, but it was also the U.K.
[02:41:34.489 --> 02:41:36.029]  and France and other nations as well.
[02:41:36.069 --> 02:41:37.350]  So they're pulling them all in.
[02:41:37.610 --> 02:41:41.150]  And the key is they're saying, these guys are going to attack you with this.
[02:41:41.350 --> 02:41:41.591]  Yes.
[02:41:41.791 --> 02:41:48.072]  Which shows their understanding, because I've been saying over and over again, the next plan is to turn the jihadis loose on us with the missiles.
[02:41:48.872 --> 02:41:54.797]  And they think we're so dumb, Anthony, that they'll go, we've got to take your rights, Al-Qaeda hit us!
[02:41:55.297 --> 02:42:01.522]  The Reuters comments, you can read some, they said, why would they attack Europe if the Europeans are controlling the jihadists?
[02:42:02.023 --> 02:42:03.224]  This answers the question.
[02:42:03.504 --> 02:42:08.468]  They are controlling their own officers to attack other countries and then unleash them like we saw in the US.
[02:42:08.488 --> 02:42:12.411]  They used them in the 80s and 90s, Al-Qaeda, and then they used it on the United States.
[02:42:12.431 --> 02:42:13.492]  Why can't adults
[02:42:14.372 --> 02:42:18.676]  I remember when Episode 3 of Star Wars came out, the only good one of the next three really.
[02:42:19.256 --> 02:42:21.998]  I'm kind of a fan in a cheesy way.
[02:42:22.178 --> 02:42:28.103]  But the storyline, everyone was asking George Lucas months after it came out, we don't understand your storyline.
[02:42:28.943 --> 02:42:30.084]  And it was so simple.
[02:42:30.684 --> 02:42:37.026]  Emperor Palpatine has become emperor by staging an attack on his own planet to then become a prominent senator, saying they hadn't done enough.
[02:42:37.407 --> 02:42:42.469]  Then to stage more attacks on the imperial planet under emergency to make himself chancellor.
[02:42:43.009 --> 02:42:47.271]  And then to finally make himself emperor and shut up the Jedi and say they're all traitors.
[02:42:47.551 --> 02:42:57.435]  And it turns out he was running the, it's literally Al Qaeda people, it's sand folks from desert planets, attacking and then he double crosses and kills all them.
[02:42:58.584 --> 02:42:59.885]  And then wipes everybody out.
[02:42:59.905 --> 02:43:02.567]  And he said, this is what's really going on with 9-11.
[02:43:02.607 --> 02:43:03.127]  That's a quote.
[02:43:03.608 --> 02:43:05.489]  Obviously showing he's a 9-11 truther, basically.
[02:43:05.909 --> 02:43:08.271]  Explaining how geopolitical both sides work.
[02:43:08.951 --> 02:43:12.033]  And the, I think it was Vanity Fair that interviewed him, said, we still don't understand.
[02:43:12.634 --> 02:43:14.195]  Adults cannot understand this.
[02:43:14.375 --> 02:43:16.236]  They play the same thing over and over again.
[02:43:16.256 --> 02:43:18.178]  Do you remember the report I did on the CIA?
[02:43:18.218 --> 02:43:20.079]  They can't understand a Star Wars movie.
[02:43:20.179 --> 02:43:20.559]  They can't.
[02:43:20.599 --> 02:43:21.339]  That has this plot.
[02:43:21.579 --> 02:43:33.302]  And Reagan assisted, you know, Reagan can do no wrong, he assisted Saddam Hussein, and the CIA did, in launching chemical attacks on, from Iraq to Iran so Iraq could seal a victory.
[02:43:33.322 --> 02:43:34.302]  Do you remember that in the 80s?
[02:43:34.322 --> 02:43:42.664]  Yeah, they were losing, and the CIA authorized with the weather reports and the satellites, and even sold them rapidly, the British
[02:43:45.084 --> 02:43:52.529]  18 wheelers that can pump up hydrogen balloons, so the CIA could direct the chemical weapons, because they didn't have good GPS then, with the cameras.
[02:43:53.129 --> 02:43:56.852]  And then that's why they had the list of those, and then later said, these are anthrax trucks.
[02:43:57.072 --> 02:43:58.713]  From Saddam Hussein.
[02:43:59.053 --> 02:44:01.534]  The ones they shipped in to help run the chemical attack.
[02:44:01.915 --> 02:44:02.795]  Absolutely, yeah.
[02:44:02.815 --> 02:44:04.436]  They helped them, and then they attacked them.
[02:44:04.456 --> 02:44:06.798]  They helped Saddam Hussein, he was great, we need to help him.
[02:44:06.818 --> 02:44:08.279]  Well, they put him in power, actually.
[02:44:08.959 --> 02:44:11.041]  They control him and then they also go and attack them.
[02:44:11.061 --> 02:44:14.704]  Just like Al-Qaeda, they owned Al-Qaeda and controlled Al-Qaeda and then they make them the bad guy.
[02:44:14.944 --> 02:44:15.905]  Now they're the good guy again.
[02:44:16.145 --> 02:44:17.206]  This happens over and over again.
[02:44:17.246 --> 02:44:18.507]  The chemical attack pattern.
[02:44:18.867 --> 02:44:23.170]  We launched the chemical attacks from Iraq towards Iran to justify military action.
[02:44:23.511 --> 02:44:29.175]  Now we're launching chemical attacks to the Syrian rebels who behead Christians on Syria to justify military action.
[02:44:29.415 --> 02:44:30.536]  It happens over and over again.
[02:44:30.556 --> 02:44:37.202]  And so many good old boys, like I heard one this morning on syndicated radio going, well good, we got both sides killing each other.
[02:44:37.722 --> 02:44:38.322]  You idiot!
[02:44:38.382 --> 02:44:40.043]  The globalists don't care about you either.
[02:44:40.323 --> 02:44:42.504]  They're going to use Al Qaeda to take your liberties here.
[02:44:43.225 --> 02:44:47.547]  Anthony, the story is up on Infowars.com, StoryLeak.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:44:47.567 --> 02:44:48.027]  Great job.
[02:44:48.427 --> 02:44:48.707]  Thank you.
[02:44:49.288 --> 02:44:50.688]  All right, there goes Anthony.
[02:44:50.708 --> 02:44:52.049]  I'm going to go back to your calls, L.A.
[02:44:52.629 --> 02:44:57.031]  and others, that have been patiently holding here in just a moment.
[02:44:57.051 --> 02:45:01.874]  But I want to first tell you about a new sponsor we've got, that I looked into, and I think it's kind of a neat idea.
[02:45:01.894 --> 02:45:06.156]  Let me show TV viewers this, but for if you're not a TV viewer and or a radio listener,
[02:45:06.917 --> 02:45:11.784]  All you do is go to patriotbadge.com so you can see this.
[02:45:12.445 --> 02:45:15.329]  And it's a little Patriot badge that goes on your car.
[02:45:16.771 --> 02:45:19.455]  And it just simply says, Christian U.S.
[02:45:19.495 --> 02:45:21.598]  Patriot Law Enforcement Support.
[02:45:22.159 --> 02:45:25.941]  And it plays off on those, you know, protection badges people buy that give some of the money to the charity.
[02:45:26.221 --> 02:45:27.862]  But then you hand it to them in an envelope.
[02:45:27.882 --> 02:45:38.768]  This is developed by a guy whose buddy was a cop in Florida and got paranoid because the person was fumbling around, stepped back, got run over by a Mack truck, back before they used to come around to the driver's side.
[02:45:38.788 --> 02:45:40.889]  So you use the truthful psychology.
[02:45:40.929 --> 02:45:41.770]  It's not manipulative.
[02:45:41.790 --> 02:45:48.233]  It's just psychology of, here's everything in my packet, my driver's license, my insurance, you know, all my stuff.
[02:45:48.494 --> 02:45:50.515]  It's in one spot above my mirror or whatever.
[02:45:51.556 --> 02:45:53.619]  And then by the way, here's my U.S.
[02:45:53.639 --> 02:45:57.905]  Patriot Peace Officer Support courtesy folder with documents enclosed.
[02:45:57.925 --> 02:45:59.547]  You get a bunch of copies of these when you sign up.
[02:46:00.148 --> 02:46:01.270]  And then what you do is...
[02:46:03.327 --> 02:46:06.029]  Then they read it from a positive perspective.
[02:46:06.249 --> 02:46:07.390]  You don't have a right to search me.
[02:46:07.430 --> 02:46:08.711]  Here's the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:46:08.952 --> 02:46:11.274]  So it's not like, you don't have a right, you scumbag, traitor.
[02:46:11.294 --> 02:46:13.676]  It's like, hi, I support you and your freedom, too.
[02:46:14.216 --> 02:46:16.118]  And I'm telling you, it's amazing.
[02:46:16.158 --> 02:46:21.322]  So find out more about that at patriotbadge.com, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:46:21.402 --> 02:46:23.344]  One word, patriotbadge.com.

[02:46:24.966 --> 02:46:26.308]  Very interesting.
[02:46:26.669 --> 02:46:28.072]  Okay, continuing here.
[02:46:28.172 --> 02:46:35.445]  Also, efoodsdirect.com did a great job sending 50,000 free meals to the folks up there after the tornado in Oklahoma City.
[02:46:37.711 --> 02:46:40.372]  That was an act of God, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:46:40.392 --> 02:46:42.433]  We never know when these acts of God are going to happen.
[02:46:42.894 --> 02:46:49.697]  So it's very, very important, for whatever reason, all the things on the horizon, the financial stuff, they want you dependent on them.
[02:46:49.737 --> 02:46:50.198]  Why is that?

[02:48:12.155 --> 02:48:18.280]  And look how we're changing history together, how our stories, our real analysis is breaking the paradigm.
[02:48:18.971 --> 02:48:20.593]  In fact, I was on Man Cow Show this morning.
[02:48:20.613 --> 02:48:21.754]  He said, I don't know how you're not dead.
[02:48:21.794 --> 02:48:23.316]  Well, my grandma's praying for me.
[02:48:23.817 --> 02:48:24.958]  Plus, we're very prominent.
[02:48:25.018 --> 02:48:28.342]  As Jim Garrison told everybody that was being killed, he said, you gotta be public.
[02:48:28.582 --> 02:48:29.944]  They kill you before you're public.
[02:48:30.164 --> 02:48:33.368]  They don't kill you when you're super public, because then you've already told your story.
[02:48:34.609 --> 02:48:39.274]  Whistleblowers call me, want to tell me stuff, I go, eh, eh, do not tell me a word if this isn't going on air right now.
[02:48:40.148 --> 02:48:40.909]  And they go, why?
[02:48:40.929 --> 02:48:42.750]  And I said, I don't want to die.
[02:48:43.330 --> 02:48:44.111]  I told the D.C.
[02:48:44.131 --> 02:48:44.591]  madam that.
[02:48:44.992 --> 02:48:46.733]  John Harmon was running the show during a three-minute break.
[02:48:47.153 --> 02:48:49.395]  I told her, you've got all this stuff on air.
[02:48:49.415 --> 02:48:52.637]  I don't want to know anything about it unless you're going to tell everybody about it.
[02:48:52.777 --> 02:48:54.359]  I said, during the break, you were just telling me stuff.
[02:48:54.379 --> 02:48:55.920]  They played it on Fox News when they killed her.
[02:48:56.570 --> 02:48:57.871]  Later, they had me on a roll about it.
[02:48:58.251 --> 02:49:00.492]  And I told her, I said, listen, they're going to kill you over this.
[02:49:01.153 --> 02:49:03.034]  You've got the names of all these high power people.
[02:49:03.154 --> 02:49:04.795]  Do not tell me their names.
[02:49:05.415 --> 02:49:06.676]  I know nothing, nothing.
[02:49:06.756 --> 02:49:07.496]  She didn't tell me anything.
[02:49:07.716 --> 02:49:10.978]  The government was listening anyways to her on the phone with me during that break.
[02:49:11.018 --> 02:49:12.159]  And they killed her a month later, folks.
[02:49:13.059 --> 02:49:14.200]  I talked to investigate.
[02:49:14.560 --> 02:49:16.061]  They were trying to kill Wayne Madsen, too.
[02:49:16.681 --> 02:49:19.663]  He had he was hanging out with her and he was the one.
[02:49:20.323 --> 02:49:21.564]  I got how I got her on the show.
[02:49:22.044 --> 02:49:23.705]  This is not a game, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:49:24.872 --> 02:49:30.393]  I mean, I was going to have Gary Webb, the Pulitzer Prize winner, on.
[02:49:30.713 --> 02:49:40.236]  He had his book coming out in a couple months, but somehow they got the publisher not to do it, and it was the second part of Dark Alliance, and they killed him at his house, shot him twice in the head.
[02:49:40.616 --> 02:49:43.877]  I can't tell you how many people, people ask, well, why do you talk about being killed then?
[02:49:44.637 --> 02:49:49.998]  Almost as an insurance policy, if I point this out, if they do, because they killed D.C.
[02:49:50.018 --> 02:49:51.919]  Maddox, he said, I'll never kill myself, never.
[02:49:53.035 --> 02:49:54.236]  And they said, oh, she killed herself.
[02:49:54.256 --> 02:49:55.117]  Here's the suicide note.
[02:49:55.177 --> 02:49:58.101]  And some guy that she'd never met, never knew, said, I was her friend.
[02:49:58.401 --> 02:49:59.502]  She told me she would.
[02:49:59.522 --> 02:50:07.391]  We're going to come back and go to Bob listing on KOMY 1340 AM in LA, listing out in California.
[02:50:08.252 --> 02:50:09.933]  Uh, and Dave and Steve and Andy.
[02:50:10.593 --> 02:50:12.655]  And so many times I ask the caller, how are you listening?
[02:50:12.855 --> 02:50:14.236]  They're listening on an AM or FM affiliate.
[02:50:14.556 --> 02:50:18.138]  You might volunteer that so we can plug all of our great affiliates out there as well.
[02:50:18.158 --> 02:50:23.101]  In fact, let's go to Bob listening out there in California first.
[02:50:23.121 --> 02:50:23.741]  Then we'll go to L.A.
[02:50:23.761 --> 02:50:24.361]  when we come back.
[02:50:24.441 --> 02:50:27.103]  Bob, real fast, what's your take on everything that's happening?
[02:50:29.364 --> 02:50:30.685]  Hey, Bob, come on down, buddy.
[02:50:32.366 --> 02:50:33.867]  Bob is listening to his radio, I bet.
[02:50:33.887 --> 02:50:34.827]  All right, we'll go back to him.
[02:50:34.868 --> 02:50:35.868]  Let's go to L.A.
[02:50:36.028 --> 02:50:36.729]  in California.
[02:50:36.749 --> 02:50:37.109]  Go ahead.
[02:50:39.034 --> 02:50:39.754]  Uh, Alex.
[02:50:40.294 --> 02:50:40.514]  Hey, buddy.
[02:50:40.534 --> 02:50:48.156]  Thank you for, uh... Listen, I've got a couple of points I'd like to make, and maybe wake you up on some things.
[02:50:48.176 --> 02:50:49.816]  Okay.
[02:50:51.216 --> 02:50:54.597]  Uh, number one, the people in the U.S.
[02:50:54.677 --> 02:50:59.698]  are still behind the government as a whole, simply because they feel as a whole.
[02:51:00.318 --> 02:51:08.039]  Now, your listeners are waking up, and I've been following you for over ten years, so your listeners are awake.
[02:51:09.164 --> 02:51:10.024]  To a great extent.
[02:51:10.745 --> 02:51:14.027]  The people as a whole in the U.S.
[02:51:14.047 --> 02:51:15.107]  still think the U.S.
[02:51:15.207 --> 02:51:22.291]  government is doing in the world what is best for them, the U.S.
[02:51:22.371 --> 02:51:22.951]  as a whole.
[02:51:22.971 --> 02:51:23.692]  Alright, stay there.
[02:51:23.712 --> 02:51:24.392]  I think you have a good point.
[02:51:24.412 --> 02:51:25.173]  I want to have you finish.
[02:51:25.213 --> 02:51:25.733]  Don't hang up.
[02:51:26.733 --> 02:51:28.134]  Steve, then we'll come back to everybody else.
[02:51:28.894 --> 02:51:30.015]  I want to say this unequivocally.
[02:51:30.355 --> 02:51:31.776]  The people running the U.S.
[02:51:31.796 --> 02:51:33.357]  government are the most wicked in history.
[02:51:34.622 --> 02:51:34.883]  They are.
[02:51:34.903 --> 02:51:39.090]  They're the most cunning, the most sneaky, and they have the biggest murder plans of anybody in history.
[02:51:41.121 --> 02:51:47.503]  Quantitative easing, unemployment at depression levels, Europe financial system falling apart, China getting out of U.S.
[02:51:47.583 --> 02:51:48.123]  Treasuries.
[02:51:48.363 --> 02:51:55.426]  At the end of 2008, the time of TARP, the national debt was at $11 trillion, gold trading around $850 per ounce.
[02:51:55.726 --> 02:52:02.228]  Close to 2012, the national debt exceeded $16.4 trillion, gold doubled to $1,600 per ounce.
[02:52:02.408 --> 02:52:05.389]  The $20 trillion threshold for the national debt is inevitable.
[02:52:05.629 --> 02:52:09.592]  Politicians in Washington have a ferocious appetite for spending and stimulus.
[02:52:09.752 --> 02:52:12.034]  What's worse, a printing press to finance.
[02:52:12.434 --> 02:52:18.078]  A hundred years ago, we had a gold standard to limit this madness, but now you have to adopt your own gold standard.
[02:52:18.218 --> 02:52:19.939]  Don't be fooled with paper promises.
[02:52:20.019 --> 02:52:23.862]  Get Midas Resources ten reasons to buy gold free by calling 800-686-2237.
[02:52:26.644 --> 02:52:32.068]  Understanding the gold and silver market may be the only insurance you could have to avoiding the next economic crisis.

[02:52:36.831 --> 02:52:37.832]  Again, that's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:52:38.532 --> 02:52:42.175]  Introducing Pro1.
[02:52:42.435 --> 02:52:45.938]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on the go.
[02:52:46.058 --> 02:52:50.501]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[02:52:50.621 --> 02:52:52.002]  You have a system that cuts out the
[02:52:52.142 --> 02:52:56.585]  Sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[02:52:56.705 --> 02:53:07.491]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.
[02:53:07.691 --> 02:53:13.995]  It is the only one that does it, and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[02:53:14.176 --> 02:53:28.926]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands,
[02:53:31.007 --> 02:53:42.234]  Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins.
[02:53:42.514 --> 02:53:48.778]  Amino acids have to be delivered to your body in the shape that nature gave them, if they are to be used to create new proteins in your body.
[02:53:49.118 --> 02:53:57.123]  Just like a bricklayer cannot use bent or twisted bricks to build a brick wall, so too your body cannot use bent or twisted amino acids to build new proteins.
[02:53:57.643 --> 02:54:01.746]  Giving your body an undamaged amino acid food can make a huge difference in your health.
[02:54:02.407 --> 02:54:06.270]  One World Way is an undamaged amino acid food unlike any other.
[02:54:06.550 --> 02:54:14.316]  You see, heating bends and twists amino acids, and all whey protein powders we've investigated, and most proteins you consume, are heated.
[02:54:14.676 --> 02:54:18.179]  With our TrueCool process, you now have a choice with One World Way.
[02:54:18.579 --> 02:54:19.479]  My name is Daniel.
[02:54:19.599 --> 02:54:20.780]  I'm 34 years old.
[02:54:20.820 --> 02:54:24.541]  When I started using One World Way, I weighed 228 pounds.
[02:54:24.781 --> 02:54:28.323]  Now, after two and a half months, I weigh 182 pounds.
[02:54:28.483 --> 02:54:29.603]  This is my ideal weight.
[02:54:29.783 --> 02:54:34.525]  I've noticed an increase in stamina, rate of recovery from workouts, and an increase in my potency.
[02:54:34.765 --> 02:54:36.306]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit OneWorldWay.com.
[02:54:58.210 --> 02:55:08.373]  Well, the scientific way to get these people that don't see into the corruption in the government and the
[02:55:27.842 --> 02:55:32.063]  These forces in the government aren't really backing their interest.
[02:55:33.544 --> 02:55:41.926]  It's got to be done through just waking the people up to how they themselves can participate directly in government.
[02:55:41.986 --> 02:55:52.809]  That's not to say that the people need to have, you know, just a blanket
[02:55:55.239 --> 02:56:16.511]  Control of the government, but just a participation greater than this representation system, which you advocate and I advocate, but an additional part of that should be direct participation at every level by the people in order to protect their own interest.
[02:56:18.412 --> 02:56:19.313]  Does that make any sense?
[02:56:20.393 --> 02:56:21.093]  No, I hear you.
[02:56:21.353 --> 02:56:24.934]  I mean, look, we're a decadent public on average.
[02:56:24.954 --> 02:56:28.756]  Even people who work hard, a lot of them just are decadent when it comes to knowing how the world works.
[02:56:29.356 --> 02:56:32.717]  And, you know, just waking people up isn't going to fix things either.
[02:56:32.737 --> 02:56:34.117]  We have to kick these globalists out.
[02:56:34.817 --> 02:56:40.139]  I mean, they've only got 9% approval for this new war, but they may still go ahead with it.
[02:56:40.159 --> 02:56:43.880]  So, you know, we can wring our hands all day.
[02:56:43.920 --> 02:56:45.461]  It was 5% who defeated the British.
[02:56:46.280 --> 02:56:50.223]  And if it comes down to it again, we'll defeat the tyranny again, or we can just totally submit to it.
[02:56:50.743 --> 02:56:51.804]  But I appreciate your call.
[02:56:56.227 --> 02:56:59.609]  We've got to somehow explain to people that the government is not there for its best interests.
[02:57:00.129 --> 02:57:02.751]  It's there for special interests that are very, very nasty on average.
[02:57:03.772 --> 02:57:05.353]  Let's talk to Steve in Illinois.
[02:57:05.393 --> 02:57:06.214]  Steve, you're on the air.
[02:57:06.254 --> 02:57:06.554]  Welcome.
[02:57:08.956 --> 02:57:09.997]  I second the motion.
[02:57:10.057 --> 02:57:14.262]  John Harmon should be your right hand man substituting for you when you take a day off.
[02:57:14.622 --> 02:57:15.403]  He's a great guy.
[02:57:15.423 --> 02:57:20.629]  By the way, we don't screen calls, bro.
[02:57:20.649 --> 02:57:24.594]  This thing of kissing the butt of the guy that answers the phones isn't what we do here.
[02:57:25.829 --> 02:57:29.731]  I know, I know, but I've dealt with him for years, and you know that, and he's always been a great guy.
[02:57:30.751 --> 02:57:39.675]  What I don't want to see is, I don't want to see a Damascus Affair Redux with a President Martin Van Buren sending troops into Damascus again under a phony pretext.
[02:57:40.395 --> 02:57:46.298]  I think we have to look at these so-called victims, like they did to instigate World War I against the Germans.
[02:57:46.778 --> 02:57:51.080]  They called them, they actually brought in English people, or five-minute men, they called them.
[02:57:51.500 --> 02:58:03.728]  And these were victims of construction and factory accidents, and they all claim to have amputated limbs or paralyzed by the crowds, when in fact they were people that were accident victims from construction or auto accidents.
[02:58:03.928 --> 02:58:05.749]  No, no, there was a lot of war propaganda.
[02:58:06.209 --> 02:58:14.034]  They did it to attack the Serbs, showed they brought in a guy who had tuberculosis and cancer and had him stand up against a fence and said he was in a concentration camp.
[02:58:14.395 --> 02:58:15.455]  And that's been confirmed.
[02:58:16.116 --> 02:58:17.997]  That's what they do, yeah, absolutely.
[02:58:18.986 --> 02:58:20.769]  And so we can take that with a grain of salt.
[02:58:20.809 --> 02:58:26.215]  But then, you know, I was looking at the Bill Saiteng yesterday, and they had like a flowchart of all these different elements.
[02:58:26.676 --> 02:58:33.144]  And they said the biggest factor they felt was the Emirate Quartar.
[02:58:33.464 --> 02:58:37.229]  The Emirate Quartar, because they had all this money stored in London.
[02:58:37.709 --> 02:58:40.811]  And so they're very influential with the Limeys.
[02:58:41.351 --> 02:58:45.853]  And going through this flowchart here, you see different things.
[02:58:45.933 --> 02:58:50.095]  Like it says that the Muslim Brotherhood is supported by Qatar and Turkey.
[02:58:50.575 --> 02:58:51.716]  And then you see something else.
[02:58:51.736 --> 02:58:53.477]  There's another faction, Michael.
[02:58:53.877 --> 02:58:55.218]  No, I mean, it's a whole mess.
[02:58:55.258 --> 02:59:06.087]  By the way, folks, the term limey comes from the British knew to have limes so they wouldn't get scurvy and everybody made fun of them of it, but then they'd be 5,000 miles from home and in fighting condition, others wouldn't.
[02:59:06.667 --> 02:59:20.198]  But anyways, as for this chemical weapons report, we saw this earlier in the year being floated around with different defense companies who weren't involved in it, but the point is it was being pushed around.
[02:59:22.268 --> 02:59:26.057]  We'll be back.
[02:59:26.137 --> 02:59:29.164]  And the nightly news tonight, 7 o'clock Central Standard Time.

[03:00:31.587 --> 03:00:34.449]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[03:00:35.170 --> 03:00:38.372]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:45.339 --> 03:00:49.542]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:00:50.182 --> 03:00:50.983]  You want answers?
[03:00:51.763 --> 03:00:52.684]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:53.304 --> 03:00:56.907]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:57.507 --> 03:01:01.610]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:01:19.545 --> 03:01:24.386]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now into overdrive, taking some final calls here.
[03:01:25.486 --> 03:01:35.389]  It looks like cooler heads are prevailing, at least a little bit, with more defense ministers and others around the world saying let's not have a war with Syria, an open hot war that's going to lead to World War III.
[03:01:35.409 --> 03:01:41.770]  And mainly there's such public anger at the whole plan, only 9% approval in major polls, that
[03:01:43.240 --> 03:01:50.166]  Right now, Obama's fidgeting back and forth, so it shows that sanity can prevail, but still there's the horrible evil proxy war.
[03:01:51.258 --> 03:01:58.881]  Using Al-Qaeda to commit those atrocities against the Syrian people of all religious backgrounds and multiracial backgrounds as well.
[03:01:59.581 --> 03:02:04.944]  It's not just important that they're killing Christians, though, that really gets to me, that our media would just cover that up.
[03:02:05.884 --> 03:02:07.345]  It's just horrible they're killing everybody.
[03:02:07.385 --> 03:02:08.685]  And again, they make it all about Assad.
[03:02:08.725 --> 03:02:09.526]  It's not about Assad.
[03:02:09.546 --> 03:02:11.026]  It's about he didn't start this.
[03:02:11.506 --> 03:02:13.207]  And those little kids didn't start this either.
[03:02:14.248 --> 03:02:15.788]  Let's talk to Dave in Minnesota.
[03:02:15.808 --> 03:02:16.508]  You're on the air, Dave.
[03:02:16.528 --> 03:02:16.849]  Welcome.
[03:02:17.749 --> 03:02:19.570]  Alex, thank you so much for having me on today, man.
[03:02:19.710 --> 03:02:20.090]  Thank you, buddy.
[03:02:20.774 --> 03:02:21.654]  I appreciate what you do.
[03:02:21.674 --> 03:02:26.336]  I appreciate you staying over your allotted time and allowing me to share some overtime with you.
[03:02:27.436 --> 03:02:29.977]  Just wanted to touch on a couple of really quick things here regarding Syria.
[03:02:31.277 --> 03:02:34.898]  First off, I think it's a huge distraction from something that's about to happen on the 1st.
[03:02:35.998 --> 03:02:45.661]  I'm not sure if you know about what the Pope had sent out about immunity being stripped away from officers in government and officers in corporations.
[03:02:46.465 --> 03:02:50.787]  I mean, the immunity I speak of is the immunity towards like war crimes and things like that.
[03:02:50.848 --> 03:02:53.289]  Like, you know, Obama just signed something recently.
[03:02:53.309 --> 03:03:02.194]  It's giving the Bush guys immunity from crimes, war crimes that they were being tried for over, I don't remember where it was, overseas.
[03:03:02.234 --> 03:03:06.016]  But I thought that that was a possibility that this was just a huge distraction.
[03:03:06.056 --> 03:03:09.818]  You see Bernanke is resigning effective September 1.
[03:03:10.498 --> 03:03:11.259]  Napolitano is
[03:03:12.217 --> 03:03:13.217]  Uh, resigning.
[03:03:13.418 --> 03:03:14.498]  There's a few things going on.
[03:03:14.638 --> 03:03:15.598]  Of course it's a giant.
[03:03:15.618 --> 03:03:22.481]  Well, I mean, they want to take over Syria and break it in a couple pieces, but yes, it is also a diversion from all the scandals.
[03:03:22.521 --> 03:03:23.901]  I mean, how many are there?
[03:03:24.141 --> 03:03:35.085]  IRS, NSA, Benghazigate, Fast and Furious, the Solyndra energy scam deals, uh, the insider trading deal.
[03:03:35.105 --> 03:03:36.246]  I mean, it just goes on and on.
[03:03:37.006 --> 03:03:40.587]  It's a giant political diversion, just like the Trayvon Martin thing was.
[03:03:40.987 --> 03:03:45.468]  It's just whatever they can get us fighting with each other over, absolutely.
[03:03:45.528 --> 03:03:58.830]  One thing I wanted to point out, I think this alludes back to an earlier caller, he had mentioned something about, we, you know, for the people and of the people and things like that, people need to understand that this government is literally a corporation, it is incorporated.
[03:03:59.110 --> 03:04:04.391]  That's why our president can be a Kenyan, you may as well go vote for the president of Target, you know, it does not matter.
[03:04:05.228 --> 03:04:07.149]  It's a, it's a corporate government.
[03:04:07.289 --> 03:04:10.571]  It is not a real, it's a de facto government.
[03:04:10.611 --> 03:04:11.892]  No, listen, I agree with you.
[03:04:11.912 --> 03:04:15.855]  That's why they can tell Congress, hey, we don't need to follow you to launch wars.
[03:04:15.895 --> 03:04:16.655]  I appreciate your call.
[03:04:17.236 --> 03:04:18.396]  We need to get that word out to people.
[03:04:18.436 --> 03:04:18.957]  I agree with you.
[03:04:19.337 --> 03:04:19.937]  That's a fact.
[03:04:20.017 --> 03:04:21.098]  I mean, this is crazy.
[03:04:21.678 --> 03:04:23.700]  Uh, Andy in West Virginia, you're on the air.
[03:04:23.720 --> 03:04:24.020]  Welcome.
[03:04:24.900 --> 03:04:25.781]  Hey bro, go ahead.
[03:04:28.769 --> 03:04:39.906]  Hey, I'm actually calling in about this October 1st deadline with the FEMA camps and our Region 3, where I'm calling out of West Virginia.
[03:04:40.226 --> 03:04:44.092]  They've ordered three-day supplies for every kid they have in these schools.
[03:04:45.033 --> 03:04:49.057]  Yeah, there's a lot of mobilization going on because this could turn into a war with Russia.
[03:05:05.916 --> 03:05:10.998]  Most of the analysts say, not just the people we have on, that this could go into World War III.
[03:05:11.538 --> 03:05:13.539]  They could stage terror attacks and say Assad did it.
[03:05:14.999 --> 03:05:16.180]  Sky's the limit with these people.
[03:05:16.760 --> 03:05:17.340]  So who knows?
[03:05:17.840 --> 03:05:20.061]  I'm sorry brother, I'm out of time, but we should do more on that.
