[00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:01.202]  Broadcasting Network.
[00:00:17.352 --> 00:00:21.536]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:22.197 --> 00:00:22.998]  You want answers?
[00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:24.699]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.004]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:29.524 --> 00:00:33.568]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.491 --> 00:00:39.832]  We're going to jam in a few more phone calls for George Norrie, but don't worry, everybody else will get to talk to Sheriff Mack and myself coming up.
[00:00:40.392 --> 00:00:47.994]  George Norrie, host of Coast2CoastAM.com, GeorgeNorrieLive.com to find out about his live events, not just the one in Canada this Saturday that I'll be part of.
[00:00:48.854 --> 00:00:55.616]  And then, of course, everywhere I go, I see people talking about your show, Beyond Belief, and I see the ads all over the place, George.
[00:00:55.676 --> 00:00:56.836]  That must be pretty successful.
[00:00:59.072 --> 00:01:02.795]  It's something I tape once a month for shows, Alex.
[00:01:03.215 --> 00:01:04.676]  Love to get you up there as a guest.
[00:01:04.716 --> 00:01:05.677]  We tape in Denver.
[00:01:06.518 --> 00:01:07.398]  And they air it.
[00:01:07.438 --> 00:01:08.840]  It's an internet-based show.
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.401]  The company is called GuyMTV.
[00:01:12.142 --> 00:01:15.705]  And they just wanted to get into television in a big way.
[00:01:15.785 --> 00:01:17.106]  And it's like Netflix.
[00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:19.007]  They charge a nominal monthly fee.
[00:01:19.507 --> 00:01:24.211]  But they also have access to thousands of self-help videos.
[00:01:24.941 --> 00:01:29.263]  They bought Divendy from Universal, and they provide all that.
[00:01:29.363 --> 00:01:33.305]  I mean, so, for a little fee every month, I mean, you can do everything.
[00:01:33.325 --> 00:01:42.849]  Hey, you tell me when, and I'll set it up with Tom, the great producer of that show, and Coast, of course, along with Lisa Lyon, and I would love to come any time you'd like.
[00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:43.449]  I love Denver.
[00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.992]  Anybody wants info on the TV show, just go to our website, coasttocoastam.com.
[00:01:49.552 --> 00:01:54.414]  You click Hosts at the top, and then it just opens up, the TV icon is there.
[00:01:54.943 --> 00:01:56.447]  We've got it on screen for viewers as well.
[00:01:57.028 --> 00:01:57.589]  Let's go real quick.
[00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:58.832]  Paul in Florida.
[00:01:58.852 --> 00:02:00.376]  Then we'll go to Joseph.
[00:02:00.577 --> 00:02:01.138]  Go ahead, Paul.
[00:02:01.218 --> 00:02:02.100]  Quick question for George.
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.301]  Yeah, hey Alex, first-line caller.
[00:02:05.861 --> 00:02:08.022]  I just wanted to thank you, sir, for waking me up.
[00:02:08.082 --> 00:02:09.122]  I know you don't like to hear it.
[00:02:09.763 --> 00:02:27.030]  And as far as George, I'd like to articulate on the first part of the segment when you talked about how the New World Order has kind of rushed things and put everything, the whole plan into perspective and kind of rushing it in now because it's almost like they are sort of bleeding out.
[00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.610]  The more
[00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.513]  They're trying to get this takeover in as fast as they can and it's so criminal
[00:02:50.566 --> 00:02:54.508]  I mean, now it's in the news like, is it good that your smart TV's watching you?
[00:02:54.828 --> 00:02:59.389]  Not, oh my god, it's 1984, it's like, oh, all the crazies were right.
[00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.471]  But again, I guess we end the interview, George, as we started it.
[00:03:04.051 --> 00:03:05.972]  This is crazy, we're at the crossroads.
[00:03:06.672 --> 00:03:08.273]  They are panicking, Alex.
[00:03:08.453 --> 00:03:15.836]  And part of the problem with this, when we talk about the New World Order, you were in the United Kingdom at the Bilderbergs just a few weeks ago.
[00:03:17.096 --> 00:03:18.477]  These are groups of people
[00:03:19.068 --> 00:03:20.729]  And people say, who are these people?
[00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:22.710]  Well, it's obvious.
[00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.651]  They're people who have so much wealth.
[00:03:25.451 --> 00:03:32.075]  I mean, you know, just today they just revealed a report that 70% of the Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.
[00:03:32.735 --> 00:03:34.476]  These people never got paychecks.
[00:03:34.596 --> 00:03:37.658]  This is family money handed down over the eons.
[00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:39.620]  And they've got so much wealth.
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.640]  I'm talking billions of dollars.
[00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:42.541]  They're playing God!
[00:03:42.781 --> 00:03:43.501]  They're bored!
[00:03:43.941 --> 00:03:44.682]  They're bored!
[00:03:45.162 --> 00:03:47.923]  So what they do, is they do the next thing.
[00:03:48.263 --> 00:03:54.446]  And you know, believe me, if you watch Eyes Wide Shut, the Stanley Kubrick movie, you'll see some of the things that they do.
[00:03:54.486 --> 00:03:55.487]  That's what they really do.
[00:03:55.567 --> 00:03:56.407]  They're so bored!
[00:03:56.987 --> 00:03:58.828]  But this is a game for them.
[00:03:58.928 --> 00:04:00.869]  This is world domination.
[00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:03.310]  And they're having a great time doing it.
[00:04:03.996 --> 00:04:09.858]  You know, I'm sure they've got offices to go to and they sit back and they go, how can we scheme to do this?
[00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:11.339]  Or do that?
[00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:16.421]  Well, I mean, it came out that Bill and Melinda Gates met with all the world leaders secretly again in the U.S.
[00:04:16.481 --> 00:04:18.922]  two weeks before Bilderberg to reduce world population.
[00:04:19.362 --> 00:04:23.644]  And then he's the guy going, by the way, I have a shot for you, I want you to die, but I want to reduce population.
[00:04:23.664 --> 00:04:26.365]  I mean, it's so incredibly obvious.
[00:04:26.905 --> 00:04:28.806]  And we've just got to wake up to it and that's happening.
[00:04:28.826 --> 00:04:32.087]  George, I will see you, what, in the first two hours of KOS tonight.
[00:04:34.827 --> 00:04:39.672]  Coast2CoastAM.com for station listings in your area like 590 here in Austin, Texas.
[00:04:39.692 --> 00:04:44.517]  George, thank you for being a trailblazer and standing up for my family and your family and for humanity.
[00:04:44.537 --> 00:04:45.098]  We salute you.
[00:04:46.567 --> 00:04:47.808]  All right, there goes George Norey.
[00:04:48.108 --> 00:04:48.788]  Adios to him.
[00:04:49.149 --> 00:04:50.730]  We're going to bring in Richard Mack.
[00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.710]  I believe he's here.
[00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:52.711]  Yeah, there he is out there.
[00:04:52.731 --> 00:04:56.393]  We're going to bring in Richard Mack next to talk about solutions.
[00:04:56.433 --> 00:05:04.478]  Sheriff Richard Mack, speaking of Supreme Court rulings, he beat the Brady Law at the Supreme Court in studio with us, the great Sheriff Richard Mack.

[00:05:20.573 --> 00:05:22.895]  24 hours before a storm strikes, people panic.
[00:05:23.175 --> 00:05:26.397]  It would be wise to prepare ahead of the panic curve.
[00:05:26.597 --> 00:05:32.801]  The food price storm from drought and livestock problems is forecast to hit ridiculous heights by the end of the summer.

[00:08:20.693 --> 00:08:24.375]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:27.568 --> 00:08:30.130]  He rode a blazing saddle.
[00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:33.412]  He wore a shining star.
[00:08:38.556 --> 00:08:39.677]  And he's here right now.
[00:08:39.717 --> 00:08:41.918]  Sheriff Richard Mack.
[00:08:41.998 --> 00:08:43.259]  Good friend of mine.
[00:08:43.339 --> 00:08:45.901]  Always good to see him in person.
[00:08:45.981 --> 00:08:47.882]  Like a Clark Kent type guy.
[00:08:48.222 --> 00:08:50.524]  And he's here with us.
[00:08:50.584 --> 00:08:53.946]  He of course took it all the way to the Supreme Court.
[00:09:06.772 --> 00:09:09.314]  The Brady Bill being unconstitutional and beat it.
[00:09:10.154 --> 00:09:14.717]  One of the biggest Second Amendment victories we've ever had, and he's in the NRA Hall of Fame.
[00:09:15.418 --> 00:09:23.844]  SheriffMac.com, he's a best-selling author, he's making a film right now about getting the sheriffs and local police to wake up and take our counties and cities back.
[00:09:23.904 --> 00:09:25.645]  And that is the answer.
[00:09:25.665 --> 00:09:27.666]  We're going to get into all of that at the bottom of the hour.
[00:09:28.287 --> 00:09:33.971]  And Paul in Florida, and Joseph, and David, and empty Congress, and Mike.
[00:09:34.531 --> 00:09:40.292]  We're going to get to all of your calls as well on any issue, because he's also been a talk show host off and on his own right.
[00:09:40.312 --> 00:09:41.773]  He can speak to those issues.
[00:09:41.793 --> 00:09:50.135]  But I want to cover the waterfront with Sheriff Richard Mack, because he's gone to Arizona to work with the cold case posse.
[00:09:50.155 --> 00:09:51.995]  There's no doubt we don't know who Obama really is.
[00:09:52.395 --> 00:09:55.056]  There's no doubt those are fake birth certificates.
[00:09:55.076 --> 00:09:56.696]  We just don't know what exactly it means.
[00:09:57.936 --> 00:09:59.497]  Very bizarre, but he's been working on that.
[00:10:00.489 --> 00:10:01.449]  We're going to get his take on that.
[00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:21.400]  But first off, we've gone from being called kooks talking about NSA spying, because it had come out before, and kooks about the IRS harassing conservatives and libertarians, to it all being admitted, to it now coming out that indeed they are building FEMA camps, they are trying to confiscate guns, that they have army manuals on quote, re-education centers, using the Soviet term.
[00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:23.821]  I mean, it even blows me away
[00:10:24.221 --> 00:10:38.229]  That they're really this evil and corrupt and trying to just hide it in plain view and get the police and military to go along with all the dramas, all the sitcoms, all the movies where the gun owners are the terrorists and the patriots are going to kill everybody.
[00:10:38.729 --> 00:10:47.734]  I think it's, I don't think, I know it's backlashing, but I want to get your take just in general where you think the state of the country is right now and why the globalists
[00:10:48.174 --> 00:10:49.856]  We're talking about this last hour with George Norey.
[00:10:50.336 --> 00:11:04.731]  Everybody agrees they are accelerating the whole program and I think we're in a danger that if it all comes out in the open and then nobody gets in trouble it just sets the precedent and now we okay we know we're slaves but we're slaves instead of it
[00:11:05.411 --> 00:11:12.013]  Boomeranging and kind of swinging the pendulum back, and then I'm concerned if we start swinging the pendulum back, they're gonna false flag.
[00:11:12.073 --> 00:11:16.174]  So, Sheriff Mack here to film and do interviews for Obama Deception 2.
[00:11:16.454 --> 00:11:17.534]  Great to have you here, my friend.
[00:11:17.874 --> 00:11:20.055]  You heard that general breakdown I just laid out.
[00:11:20.355 --> 00:11:23.716]  What is your State of the Union take on that for our viewers?
[00:11:23.976 --> 00:11:30.120]  Well, it's amazing that a lot of this got put off until after the re-election of Mr. Obama.
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:31.721]  And you're right, we don't know who he is.
[00:11:32.662 --> 00:11:33.722]  We don't know where he's from.
[00:11:34.543 --> 00:11:38.265]  I'm not positive that he knows, sometimes when we get into that.
[00:11:39.186 --> 00:11:44.610]  There's so much going on, and isn't it wonderful, though, to have the endorsement
[00:11:45.447 --> 00:11:51.910]  of the federal government that the things that you've been preaching and talking about for the last 10 to 15 years are now coming to fruition.
[00:11:52.511 --> 00:11:54.292]  You know, they can't call you kook anymore.
[00:11:55.017 --> 00:12:04.424]  Because everything you've been saying, John Birch Society, everything they've laid out 30, 40 years ago is starting to fall apart in our own government and starting to happen.
[00:12:04.864 --> 00:12:15.652]  You know, it is absolutely astonishing, Alex, that we have so many conspiracies coming to fruition and being proved.
[00:12:16.152 --> 00:12:17.753]  I mean, especially the IRS.
[00:12:17.793 --> 00:12:19.514]  Like, that's a big surprise to anybody.
[00:12:20.015 --> 00:12:21.636]  I mean, come on.
[00:12:21.676 --> 00:12:22.857]  Haven't you been harassed by them?
[00:12:23.417 --> 00:12:23.937]  Uh, never.
[00:12:24.097 --> 00:12:24.818]  My dad did.
[00:12:24.938 --> 00:12:25.298]  That's right.
[00:12:25.358 --> 00:12:26.599]  I remember you telling that story, yeah.
[00:12:26.619 --> 00:12:27.279]  My dad got it.
[00:12:27.979 --> 00:12:31.501]  But this was just two or three years after he left the FBI.
[00:12:32.282 --> 00:12:47.630]  And so what the IRS was doing, and in fact it was exposed in 1997 by Jennifer Long and a few other whistleblowers of the IRS, saying that IRS employees routinely fabricate evidence against citizens who they know cannot afford to defend themselves.
[00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:49.391]  My father fit into that.
[00:12:50.151 --> 00:12:57.797]  And so, they just go after people who are middle class, who they know can't defend themselves, and so they thought my father would just pay the money.
[00:12:58.317 --> 00:13:02.620]  My father cared too much about justice and truth to do that, because he knew he was innocent.
[00:13:03.421 --> 00:13:05.843]  And he didn't have the funds to defend himself.
[00:13:06.403 --> 00:13:16.236]  But he had a friend, a lawyer, and a friend, a CPA, that went to bat for him, and after a year and a half of trying to destroy my father, my father proved that the IRS had lied.
[00:13:16.836 --> 00:13:23.765]  Then, Jennifer Long came along with other IRS agents, and there were two agents who refused to testify
[00:13:24.847 --> 00:13:27.069]  Unless they were done so anonymously.
[00:13:27.529 --> 00:13:32.475]  And so they were hidden behind a partition and their voices muffled and they were silhouetted behind a partition.
[00:13:32.935 --> 00:13:34.337]  Violates the Constitution.
[00:13:34.837 --> 00:13:42.866]  Sure, but the only other time that that's ever happened at Congress was when the Casa Nostra whistleblower testified about the Mafia.
[00:13:43.187 --> 00:13:44.808]  So we have the Mafia and the IRS.
[00:13:45.569 --> 00:13:47.031]  Kind of a parallel there, isn't there?
[00:13:47.811 --> 00:13:50.093]  Plus our country was built without the IRS.
[00:13:50.154 --> 00:13:52.436]  It wasn't set up till 1913 for the Federal Reserve.
[00:13:52.796 --> 00:13:54.878]  It didn't become popularly in use till the 50s.
[00:13:55.419 --> 00:13:59.863]  It has hurt our country and they can abuse whoever they want and people will tell you.
[00:13:59.923 --> 00:14:01.164]  I'm not going to criticize the government.
[00:14:01.484 --> 00:14:02.906]  The IRS will come after me.
[00:14:04.027 --> 00:14:05.749]  I know so many journalists
[00:14:06.449 --> 00:14:11.231]  And people who've been told, and they've even taped it, where the IRS says, stop covering these stories.
[00:14:11.471 --> 00:14:13.111]  They tell churches, stop praying.
[00:14:13.551 --> 00:14:17.453]  They tell pro-life groups, go be pro-abortion and we'll stop an audit.
[00:14:18.013 --> 00:14:19.193]  That's in the news now!
[00:14:19.673 --> 00:14:21.554]  I mean, that's even worse than I thought it was.
[00:14:21.634 --> 00:14:24.195]  I mean, what a criminal organization.
[00:14:24.355 --> 00:14:30.919]  It is, and so I keep, I'm writing, right now I'm in the middle of writing the sequel to The County Sheriff, America's Last Hope.
[00:14:31.359 --> 00:14:33.501]  As you said, it is the solution, it is.
[00:14:33.581 --> 00:14:40.285]  We can stop what's going on if we have sheriffs, local officials, and now we're even getting chiefs of police.
[00:14:40.925 --> 00:14:46.307]  We have chiefs of police on our board of directors, and we're getting peace officers and deputies.
[00:14:46.347 --> 00:14:47.647]  We have deputies standing up.
[00:14:47.947 --> 00:14:52.269]  Now, Deputy Lennick, who you know, because you put him out there on InfoWars.
[00:14:52.289 --> 00:14:58.291]  This is Stan Lennick from the Albany Airport, when he refused to arrest the people handing out the flyers.
[00:14:58.931 --> 00:15:00.412]  Well, he was our Deputy Sheriff of the Year.
[00:15:01.408 --> 00:15:03.790]  And so we had Deputy Lennick at our convention.
[00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:06.472]  These are the types of people... Oh, so you got to know him?
[00:15:06.952 --> 00:15:08.093]  Oh yeah, he's a great guy.
[00:15:08.153 --> 00:15:08.934]  Good man.
[00:15:08.974 --> 00:15:12.656]  Now, his wife just had a premature baby, so he came in and left.
[00:15:12.716 --> 00:15:14.017]  He didn't stay for the whole thing.
[00:15:14.558 --> 00:15:15.879]  But he had to get back to babysit.
[00:15:16.679 --> 00:15:17.740]  And what a great guy.
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:19.522]  I mean... Will you give us his contact?
[00:15:19.542 --> 00:15:20.263]  We'd like to get him on.
[00:15:20.523 --> 00:15:21.063]  Absolutely.
[00:15:21.424 --> 00:15:28.590]  You're talking about one of the most exemplary deputies in American history here with this Deputy Stan Lennick.
[00:15:29.031 --> 00:15:31.213]  And so who was our Sheriff of the Year?
[00:15:32.728 --> 00:15:34.550]  Ah, David A. Clark Jr.
[00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:35.410]  from Milwaukee.
[00:15:36.171 --> 00:15:39.654]  And so, who was calling us racist and everything?
[00:15:39.874 --> 00:15:56.048]  In fact, even after we've named Sheriff Clark, our deputy, our Sheriff of the Year, our CSBOA Sheriff of the Year, they tried to call, a local newspaper there tried to call us racist because... Well, they do that so that people will Google it and then see that and not be part of it because they're desperate.
[00:15:56.168 --> 00:15:57.689]  It's like, oh, you don't want government-run healthcare?
[00:15:57.709 --> 00:15:58.290]  You're a racist.
[00:15:58.670 --> 00:15:59.611]  You don't want world government?
[00:15:59.651 --> 00:16:00.071]  You're a racist.
[00:16:00.091 --> 00:16:01.052]  Don't want to turn your guns in?
[00:16:01.072 --> 00:16:01.593]  You're a racist.
[00:16:01.853 --> 00:16:03.134]  They just use that on everything.
[00:16:03.154 --> 00:16:04.456]  Well, Sheriff Clark responded.
[00:16:04.476 --> 00:16:07.238]  He said, I'm the only black sheriff in Wisconsin.
[00:16:07.639 --> 00:16:12.803]  I'm the only one in Wisconsin, and in the entire country, that was named Sheriff of the Year by the CSPOA.
[00:16:13.204 --> 00:16:16.147]  He says it's a little bit ridiculous to go after them for being racist.
[00:16:16.747 --> 00:16:21.231]  You know, and I want to tell SPLC, and I've told them before, I've told Mark Potok, he and I've talked a lot.
[00:16:21.431 --> 00:16:23.292]  Did you see his quote about me?
[00:16:24.473 --> 00:16:25.234]  Not recently.
[00:16:25.274 --> 00:16:28.636]  He said, Alex Jones doesn't build bombs, he builds bombers.
[00:16:29.797 --> 00:16:30.378]  In Bloomberg.
[00:16:30.798 --> 00:16:31.158]  Oh, wow.
[00:16:31.419 --> 00:16:31.859]  Sorry, go ahead.
[00:16:32.059 --> 00:16:36.763]  Wow, that's... How are things going with you and the SPLC right now?
[00:16:36.923 --> 00:16:38.865]  Well, the lawsuit got thrown out.
[00:16:39.711 --> 00:16:47.134]  And uh... I guess, you know, it was a technicality and I didn't agree with it and after they threw it out I bagged it.
[00:16:48.915 --> 00:16:53.997]  They still are going after me and they've lied about me a little bit but not nearly as much as... Why did you originally sue them?
[00:16:54.537 --> 00:16:59.579]  Because they had lied and put it out all over the country that I said let's kill federal agents.
[00:17:00.339 --> 00:17:02.460]  And you know that my message has always been one of peace.
[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:04.061]  Oh, mine is too!
[00:17:05.141 --> 00:17:06.922]  They said that I influenced
[00:17:07.782 --> 00:17:11.584]  In Bloomberg, with no evidence, that I made the bombers do it, basically.
[00:17:11.644 --> 00:17:13.185]  Oh, brother.
[00:17:13.225 --> 00:17:16.727]  Yeah, with no proof, and then they have the SPLC going, yeah, he builds bombers.
[00:17:17.208 --> 00:17:19.269]  And there's no doubt I could beat them on that.
[00:17:19.289 --> 00:17:23.972]  I mean, the ADL's lost lawsuits for stuff like that, because I just don't have time to mess with it.
[00:17:24.752 --> 00:17:25.752]  That was me too.
[00:17:25.832 --> 00:17:28.813]  And it's almost a full-time job to sue somebody like that.
[00:17:29.174 --> 00:17:29.434]  It is.
[00:17:29.714 --> 00:17:30.694]  It's a full-time job.
[00:17:30.834 --> 00:17:34.255]  And when I did the Clinton administration, as you mentioned... You beat them, Sean.
[00:17:34.595 --> 00:17:36.916]  I beat their butts all the way back to Washington.
[00:17:37.816 --> 00:17:38.797]  Miraculous case.
[00:17:38.917 --> 00:17:40.317]  Just an absolute miraculous case.
[00:17:40.357 --> 00:17:41.978]  But it was a David and Goliath story.
[00:17:42.038 --> 00:17:43.018]  And I love being David.
[00:17:43.758 --> 00:17:48.441]  And we're still creating Davids all across the country to stop all these horrible things.
[00:17:48.521 --> 00:17:48.982]  Exactly.
[00:17:49.002 --> 00:17:53.504]  I mean, those of us that are working full-time just to wake people up, folks, we need you to be the ones that sue them and stuff.
[00:17:53.805 --> 00:17:57.807]  I mean, we just had a lady in who started the lawsuit, won it, at the Supreme Court over the gene patents.
[00:17:58.548 --> 00:17:59.608]  Austinite, listener.
[00:18:00.209 --> 00:18:01.430]  Took her two years, she did it.
[00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:05.273]  And so, folks, you need to, when you're in the right, go after these people.
[00:18:05.673 --> 00:18:08.016]  And again, but the SPLC, they discredit themselves.
[00:18:08.476 --> 00:18:13.621]  Everybody knows that I'm not influencing Muslim bombers, and that I'm the opposite of that.
[00:18:13.641 --> 00:18:15.042]  I mean, that is insane.
[00:18:15.703 --> 00:18:19.386]  Well, they are insane, and what's really insane is our own government.
[00:18:19.426 --> 00:18:22.990]  Now, why doesn't the SPLC come out and assail the IRS?
[00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:26.712]  And assail the NSA and all these horrible other things.
[00:18:26.752 --> 00:18:28.173]  They call themselves a civil rights group.
[00:18:28.353 --> 00:18:29.254]  Yeah.
[00:18:29.274 --> 00:18:31.415]  So why don't they go after the government?
[00:18:31.475 --> 00:18:33.597]  They never go after the government.
[00:18:33.617 --> 00:18:36.599]  And the reason is, is because that's where they get a lot of their funding.
[00:18:37.119 --> 00:18:41.242]  They teach all these classes and get a lot of funding from the federal government.
[00:18:41.262 --> 00:18:42.443]  So they're never going to go after them.
[00:18:42.983 --> 00:18:45.325]  And that discredits them on their own.
[00:18:45.785 --> 00:18:47.026]  They are their own discredit.
[00:18:47.666 --> 00:18:53.270]  And the Southern Poverty Law Center is a joke and probably not even worthy to be on your show, quite honestly.
[00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:58.152]  Well, they are becoming more and more of a joke, but they're also very serious players, you know?
[00:18:58.192 --> 00:18:58.732]  They are.
[00:18:58.852 --> 00:19:03.794]  They ran, with their top informants, ran the Elohim City compound that McVeigh was at.
[00:19:04.574 --> 00:19:08.516]  And then Hal tried to expose that, the ATF informant, and got shut down.
[00:19:10.257 --> 00:19:22.802]  One of their informants came to the event in Valley Forge, where we spoke about two years ago, and a lot of us were there, Larry Pratt and a lot of big speakers, and that's when they supposedly got me.
[00:19:23.782 --> 00:19:27.364]  And then they tried to call me a little bit after that and do an interview.
[00:19:27.384 --> 00:19:30.646]  And I said, you guys have been lying about me for 17 years.
[00:19:31.447 --> 00:19:33.728]  And now you try to call me and ask me for my comment?
[00:19:34.108 --> 00:19:35.889]  You've been lying about me for 17 years.
[00:19:35.969 --> 00:19:37.670]  Why would you come now and ask me for a comment?
[00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:39.311]  You've never asked me for a comment before.
[00:19:39.852 --> 00:19:41.273]  They said, where have we lied about you?
[00:19:41.293 --> 00:19:44.154]  And I said, well, since the beginning, since I first filed my lawsuit.
[00:19:44.254 --> 00:19:50.638]  But most recently, when you said I said we should kill IRS agents, they checked their own tape and said, no, we we made a mistake.
[00:19:50.658 --> 00:19:51.679]  We'll have to do a retraction.
[00:19:53.328 --> 00:19:54.229]  So they did a retraction.
[00:19:54.889 --> 00:19:56.030]  Well, at least you did that.
[00:19:56.290 --> 00:19:57.031]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:19:57.071 --> 00:19:57.991]  That's not a mistake.
[00:19:58.111 --> 00:19:58.792]  No, of course not.
[00:19:58.952 --> 00:19:59.792]  It wasn't even close.
[00:19:59.872 --> 00:20:02.154]  I made the ADL change something one time.
[00:20:02.234 --> 00:20:03.375]  It was just totally made up.
[00:20:04.676 --> 00:20:06.897]  And I had to have my lawyer get in touch with him and make him do it.
[00:20:07.458 --> 00:20:10.380]  I want to come back and get into Snowden, all of this, where you see things going.
[00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:11.300]  Then phone calls.
[00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:12.281]  Richard Mack in studio.
[00:20:12.301 --> 00:20:16.904]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[00:20:17.584 --> 00:20:19.686]  I want you to know some very important information.
[00:20:20.599 --> 00:20:28.932]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.

[00:21:15.923 --> 00:21:21.367]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[00:21:21.947 --> 00:21:25.150]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?

[00:22:12.009 --> 00:22:13.210]  Hi, my name is Steven Heuer.
[00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:16.552]  As a degreed nutritionist, my first priority is for you to get healthy.
[00:22:16.792 --> 00:22:21.454]  That won't happen if I make wrong recommendations or cause you to spend money on supplements you don't need.
[00:22:21.734 --> 00:22:27.718]  After 20 years working with thousands of products and thousands of people, I know, for the most part, what does and does not work.
[00:22:28.078 --> 00:22:33.701]  One World Whey is the first and only unheated whey protein powder from grass-fed cows on the market.
[00:22:33.861 --> 00:22:37.103]  It retains substances that no other whey protein powder has.
[00:22:37.463 --> 00:22:40.526]  These nutritive compounds supply life-giving nutrition.
[00:22:40.886 --> 00:22:43.688]  Your body merely needs the right conditions to make great health happen.
[00:22:44.029 --> 00:22:48.913]  Due to low quality foods, toxicity and aging, having great health is more of an effort than ever.

[00:23:19.175 --> 00:23:20.896]  We do not sell to government agencies.

[00:23:41.121 --> 00:23:42.161]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:23:42.241 --> 00:23:46.563]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:23:46.723 --> 00:23:52.344]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:23:52.444 --> 00:23:55.785]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:23:56.025 --> 00:23:58.586]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:23:58.686 --> 00:24:03.507]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[00:24:03.647 --> 00:24:03.887]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:24:03.947 --> 00:24:05.268]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:25.391]  Stand up for your right.
[00:24:25.431 --> 00:24:26.712]  Get up, stand up.
[00:24:26.732 --> 00:24:28.673]  Stand up for your right.
[00:24:28.713 --> 00:24:29.814]  Get up, stand up.
[00:24:29.834 --> 00:24:31.295]  Stand up for your right.
[00:24:40.799 --> 00:24:43.422]  Sheriff Richard Mack is our guest.
[00:24:43.482 --> 00:24:44.463]  His dad was in the FBI.
[00:24:44.483 --> 00:24:49.187]  He's now passed on to hopefully heaven, I'm sure, in the FBI.
[00:24:49.407 --> 00:24:52.009]  And the FBI and all these agencies have always been compartmentalized.
[00:24:52.029 --> 00:24:53.751]  You've got the light side, the dark side.
[00:24:53.771 --> 00:25:00.096]  In the past, talking to really top historians and researchers, maybe 10% of federal agencies were dark side.
[00:25:00.476 --> 00:25:03.139]  Joel Skousen, who I respect, estimates it's more like 50% now, is dark side.
[00:25:07.262 --> 00:25:09.004]  What did your dad say to you about that?
[00:25:09.104 --> 00:25:11.166]  Why would the IRS come after him when he retired?
[00:25:11.186 --> 00:25:13.789]  I know they harass people they think are actually good people.
[00:25:16.191 --> 00:25:20.235]  What would your dad think today about what's happening with just all this open evil?
[00:25:21.216 --> 00:25:26.361]  Well, my dad would be shocked with all of this, but he would also say, yeah, that's what they did to me.
[00:25:27.182 --> 00:25:31.623]  And my dad learned a lot about the subterfuge of government when they audited him.
[00:25:32.123 --> 00:25:35.504]  He thought that everything in government was pretty on the up and up.
[00:25:36.284 --> 00:25:41.386]  He served, you know, 30 years in the FBI, served another five years in the Army Air Corps during World War II.
[00:25:42.826 --> 00:25:43.926]  He believed in government.
[00:25:43.986 --> 00:25:45.347]  He believed in what they were doing.
[00:25:45.707 --> 00:25:51.428]  He even believed at one point, until he and I had some extensive conversations, in the Warren Commission report.
[00:25:52.449 --> 00:25:52.769]  You know?
[00:25:52.909 --> 00:25:54.009]  Why did they go after your dad?
[00:25:54.229 --> 00:26:00.231]  But he made some enemies while he was in the Bureau, and I guess that's why they went after him, because this is very rare.
[00:26:00.291 --> 00:26:13.236]  Well, we had the son of a state police officer who called in earlier and said he was told to go after conservatives, libertarians, and that's come out in Texas, they've been told, to act like we're doing something, and it's really because we're the good guys, and the bad guys know it!
[00:26:13.516 --> 00:26:13.696]  Yeah.
[00:26:14.116 --> 00:26:18.318]  Well, my dad wasn't a real constitutionalist or anything like that.
[00:26:18.678 --> 00:26:21.820]  He was a real solid, honest man.
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:36.248]  But I think, also, the other thing that might have been, is they just started looking in the computer for people who fit the profile that the IRS wanted to go after, and they didn't see that he was a former FBI agent, and they just went after him because... It's funny you say that.
[00:26:36.408 --> 00:26:40.050]  My dad has said, please don't talk about this, but I just don't care, I will talk about it.
[00:26:42.526 --> 00:26:47.247]  He fit the profile, and later he learned they went after middle class people that were known as being nice guys, they thought they could push around.
[00:26:47.267 --> 00:26:47.627]  Exactly.
[00:26:47.827 --> 00:26:52.389]  And they told him, in Dallas, in the mid-80s, they said, we are criminals, Mr. Jones.
[00:26:52.949 --> 00:26:54.189]  They said, we are criminals.
[00:26:54.809 --> 00:26:56.830]  We will take everything you've got unless you pay us this.
[00:26:57.070 --> 00:26:57.910]  Right.
[00:26:58.290 --> 00:27:00.551]  And he was like, they said, we are criminals.
[00:27:01.231 --> 00:27:02.051]  I mean, imagine!
[00:27:02.251 --> 00:27:05.432]  And my dad was like, Mr. Mom-and-Apple-Pie's like, you're criminals?
[00:27:05.452 --> 00:27:05.532]  Yeah.
[00:27:07.176 --> 00:27:09.038]  I thought you worked for the federal government.
[00:27:09.118 --> 00:27:11.221]  I thought you were a service organization.
[00:27:11.601 --> 00:27:11.801]  IRS.
[00:27:11.861 --> 00:27:12.282]  Internal.
[00:27:12.322 --> 00:27:13.924]  But they said we are criminals.
[00:27:14.504 --> 00:27:17.007]  He brought in his receipts and everything and the CPA stuff.
[00:27:17.027 --> 00:27:17.748]  Yeah, I don't care.
[00:27:18.048 --> 00:27:19.470]  They said, hey, pal, we're criminals.
[00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:20.871]  They were like, hey, you know.
[00:27:21.472 --> 00:27:24.555]  Well, they told my father almost the same thing.
[00:27:24.595 --> 00:27:28.320]  They didn't say criminal, but they said we will ruin you unless you pay.
[00:27:29.692 --> 00:27:33.517]  Yeah, of course.
[00:27:33.898 --> 00:27:35.400]  And it's an extortion racket.
[00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:36.801]  And that's all this is.
[00:27:37.142 --> 00:27:43.050]  Those of us who still pay the extortion to stay out of prison, we're the cowards.
[00:27:44.011 --> 00:27:44.311]  I don't know.
[00:28:01.687 --> 00:28:03.949]  Well, I mean, this country is pathetic.
[00:28:04.029 --> 00:28:08.413]  My dad pulled one other card out, or he probably would have ended up like your dad.
[00:28:09.173 --> 00:28:14.738]  And he had a congressman that he used to work in the FBI with, Eldon Rudd, from Arizona.
[00:28:15.539 --> 00:28:21.144]  I think that the final straw to help my father was Eldon Rudd getting involved in it.
[00:28:21.744 --> 00:28:25.829]  And if he hadn't, I think my father would have ended up paying and we would have lost everything.
[00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:28.232]  Because my dad didn't have the money.
[00:28:28.633 --> 00:28:33.238]  My dad, to get more money in the FBI, you have to move.
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:36.401]  To get promoted, you have to move.
[00:28:36.861 --> 00:28:38.101]  My dad never wanted to move.
[00:28:38.161 --> 00:28:40.302]  He wanted us to be raised in Southern Arizona.
[00:28:40.882 --> 00:28:46.824]  And in the same community where he was the FBI for 25 years, I became the sheriff.
[00:28:47.624 --> 00:28:48.985]  And I'm really grateful.
[00:28:49.005 --> 00:28:49.705]  Did he live to see that?
[00:28:49.965 --> 00:28:50.565]  Yes, oh yes.
[00:28:50.685 --> 00:28:51.266]  But he liked that?
[00:28:51.406 --> 00:28:51.906]  Yeah, he did.
[00:28:52.746 --> 00:28:53.987]  Was he proud of your Supreme Court win?
[00:28:54.267 --> 00:28:54.647]  He was.
[00:28:54.907 --> 00:28:57.268]  He was very amazed by it as well.
[00:28:58.108 --> 00:29:01.749]  He died six years ago, so he followed all of that very strictly.
[00:29:01.769 --> 00:29:07.671]  He didn't know or understand all of my motives behind it, but he knew and understood me.
[00:29:08.571 --> 00:29:10.672]  And he knew that what I was doing was the right thing.
[00:29:11.212 --> 00:29:12.453]  He didn't like Clinton, of course.
[00:29:12.833 --> 00:29:14.254]  You know, anybody that was honest wouldn't.
[00:29:14.654 --> 00:29:17.915]  But, you know, it was just a miraculous time.
[00:29:17.975 --> 00:29:19.996]  My mother passed away just two years ago.
[00:29:20.797 --> 00:29:23.058]  And, you know, she was kind of pro-government too.
[00:29:23.098 --> 00:29:27.360]  But every time I would talk to her about, okay, what are we really doing here?
[00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:28.980]  Why are we supporting government blindly?
[00:29:29.281 --> 00:29:30.981]  I said, do you remember what they did to my father?
[00:29:31.281 --> 00:29:32.262]  Remember what they did to dad?
[00:29:32.882 --> 00:29:33.902]  And she goes, oh yeah.
[00:29:34.262 --> 00:29:38.623]  And I said, mom... But again, that shows how old-timers were so honest and so good.
[00:29:38.643 --> 00:29:39.163]  Oh, exactly.
[00:29:39.443 --> 00:29:46.665]  That even though the government had wrongly come after you and tried to ruin your life, she would still... It's just unbelievable.
[00:29:46.745 --> 00:29:50.386]  I mean, and that's why they do the crimes they really are engaged in.
[00:29:50.406 --> 00:29:50.706]  Right.
[00:29:50.926 --> 00:29:52.986]  The white slavery, the drug dealing.
[00:29:53.307 --> 00:29:58.308]  I mean, if the naive people who are well-meaning knew the truth, it's just, it's unbelievable.
[00:29:58.348 --> 00:29:59.788]  We'll be right back with Sheriff Mack.
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:04.970]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:30:05.913 --> 00:30:08.582]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:12.546 --> 00:30:17.109]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[00:30:17.269 --> 00:30:20.230]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[00:30:20.390 --> 00:30:25.613]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[00:30:25.934 --> 00:30:27.595]  It all comes down to one thing.
[00:30:27.875 --> 00:30:29.175]  We are what we eat.
[00:30:29.516 --> 00:30:33.838]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[00:30:34.178 --> 00:30:38.161]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[00:30:38.401 --> 00:30:40.662]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[00:30:40.962 --> 00:30:46.884]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[00:31:18.041 --> 00:31:22.444]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.

[00:31:25.126 --> 00:31:28.548]  And up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.

[00:32:12.311 --> 00:32:15.955]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us?
[00:32:16.175 --> 00:32:21.460]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:29.247]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[00:32:29.427 --> 00:32:38.535]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[00:32:38.735 --> 00:32:45.723]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[00:32:45.903 --> 00:32:48.767]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[00:32:48.787 --> 00:32:55.675]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse but demand a war.
[00:32:57.914 --> 00:33:01.375]  You can complain about Big Brother and how this is a potential program run amok.
[00:33:26.923 --> 00:33:30.965]  But when you actually look at the details, then I think we've struck the right balance.
[00:33:30.985 --> 00:33:46.694]  And if people can't trust not only the executive branch, but also don't trust Congress, and don't trust federal judges, to make sure that we're abiding by the Constitution, due process, and rule of law, then we're going to have some problems here.
[00:33:47.874 --> 00:33:49.615]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:50.015 --> 00:33:52.877]  Because there is a war on, for your mind.
[00:34:02.054 --> 00:34:07.917]  Alright, some of your phone calls on a host of issues are coming up.
[00:34:08.858 --> 00:34:11.359]  Sheriff Richard Mack is here in studio with us.
[00:34:11.379 --> 00:34:18.563]  We carry both of his books, The Magic of Gun Control and the one on Constitutional Sheriffs at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:34:18.663 --> 00:34:21.785]  Every sheriff in America needs to get these, and they've been getting them.
[00:34:22.984 --> 00:34:27.631]  Because now you see sheriffs all over saying, why is the Forest Service armed here?
[00:34:28.132 --> 00:34:33.319]  And that's up on InfoWars.com today, where sheriffs in Colorado are throwing them out of the towns.
[00:34:34.201 --> 00:34:36.203]  We've seen cases where they're trying to persecute.
[00:34:37.532 --> 00:34:47.499]  Sheriffs and sheriff's deputies that don't arrest people who own guns and don't enforce unconstitutional laws on law-abiding citizens.
[00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:59.568]  We've seen moves to have the Secret Service be able to come in and go after sheriffs they're trying to pass in Colorado and places and all that does is wake up the sheriffs and the police and everybody else.
[00:34:59.868 --> 00:35:02.090]  We need to get back to that healthy jurisdictional
[00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:05.291]  Boundary of the states.
[00:35:05.351 --> 00:35:08.833]  We're going to talk about that with Sheriff Richard Mack here in just a moment.
[00:35:08.893 --> 00:35:14.216]  First off, this broadcast is listener supported and everything we offer are things that I use, I believe in.

[00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:16.832]  People are really ready to wake up right now.
[00:36:17.412 --> 00:36:19.334]  They just don't believe we can have any change.
[00:36:19.394 --> 00:36:20.194]  We can have change.
[00:36:20.494 --> 00:36:25.518]  We've had incredible victories all over the world for liberty, but the globalists and their media aren't going to tell you.
[00:36:25.899 --> 00:36:30.622]  We've seen record low approval ratings for Congress, 10% in Gallup.
[00:36:31.243 --> 00:36:36.727]  We've seen record low readership and support and trust in major polls for mainstream media.
[00:36:37.348 --> 00:36:42.392]  We've seen record low support for Obama and all their globalism and their gun grabbing.
[00:36:42.972 --> 00:36:45.793]  That's why they put out fake polls saying Americans want to be spied on.
[00:36:46.073 --> 00:36:47.073]  Americans love Obama.
[00:36:47.293 --> 00:36:51.095]  But those are the public policy groups and globalist connected things.
[00:36:51.135 --> 00:36:53.596]  All the real polls show the opposite.
[00:36:53.856 --> 00:36:55.716]  And I know they're real because I'm all over the country.
[00:36:55.996 --> 00:36:57.057]  And I'm out there and I see it.
[00:36:57.477 --> 00:36:59.417]  And I talk to the police and I talk to the military.
[00:36:59.878 --> 00:37:03.359]  Upwards of half the military I talk to are awake and listening to this show alone.
[00:37:03.759 --> 00:37:04.919]  Can you imagine?
[00:37:05.139 --> 00:37:07.780]  That must give fits to the New World Order.
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:08.760]  So please support us.
[00:37:09.141 --> 00:37:09.961]  Infowars store.
[00:37:10.461 --> 00:37:11.842]  Let me add one other thing.
[00:37:31.436 --> 00:37:33.778]  I don't want anybody to think that that book's just for sheriffs.
[00:37:34.498 --> 00:37:36.340]  Every American citizen should read that book.
[00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:37.120]  It's absolutely.
[00:37:37.321 --> 00:37:38.021]  America's Last Hope.
[00:37:38.441 --> 00:37:40.483]  You need to know what he's supposed to know.
[00:37:40.543 --> 00:37:41.344]  He works for you.
[00:37:41.904 --> 00:37:43.946]  So everyone in America should get that book.
[00:37:44.206 --> 00:37:44.967]  Absolutely.
[00:37:46.008 --> 00:37:48.510]  And learn about common law, Bill of Rights, Constitution.
[00:37:48.890 --> 00:37:50.872]  They're breaking the law when they do this.
[00:37:51.292 --> 00:37:52.693]  Snowden shouldn't go to jail.
[00:37:53.014 --> 00:37:55.716]  The people that ordered them to illegally spy should go to jail.
[00:37:55.936 --> 00:37:57.057]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:37:57.197 --> 00:38:06.221]  In fact, all the whistleblowers, they usually just fire them or send them to jail, and that's what they're trying to do to Snowden now, worldwide, publicly.
[00:38:06.841 --> 00:38:18.266]  And so it's an amazing process, but I believe there's been too much light shed on what has happened, that Snowden is being protected a little bit just because of all the light that's been
[00:38:19.467 --> 00:38:26.151]  Uh, shine on him, and so I think it's just an amazing process, again, of showing the corruption of Washington, D.C.
[00:38:26.632 --> 00:38:31.775]  By the way, to correct something, I remember now what my dad said when he came home, and I've heard the story 30 times after.
[00:38:32.136 --> 00:38:37.680]  The head IRS lady he had a meeting with in Dallas, she looked at him and she said, we are white-collar criminals.
[00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:38.920]  You will not beat us.
[00:38:39.621 --> 00:38:42.803]  I mean, that's like the mafia coming in your store going, we're the mafia.
[00:38:43.103 --> 00:38:44.785]  You will pay us and we'll burn this down.
[00:38:44.805 --> 00:38:46.466]  I mean, that's what they are.
[00:38:46.866 --> 00:38:52.551]  You know, that comparison's been actually taking place in a lot of mainstream books.
[00:38:52.571 --> 00:39:02.539]  There's a book called The Sovereign Individual, written and actually printed, published by Simon & Schuster back about 12, 13 years ago.
[00:39:03.019 --> 00:39:10.685]  The Sovereign Individual talks about the Vince Foster murder being the most poorly disguised murder in American history.
[00:39:11.526 --> 00:39:14.648]  And these guys go right after and they compare the IRS
[00:39:15.609 --> 00:39:16.770]  To the mafia.
[00:39:17.010 --> 00:39:24.215]  They use the same tactics, for the same results, and this is just a mainstream book talking about finances.
[00:39:24.656 --> 00:39:27.458]  And it was done by a couple of world-renowned financiers.
[00:39:28.078 --> 00:39:35.304]  And it was not a book by Sheriff Mac or Alex Jones or any of these other radical extremists.
[00:39:35.644 --> 00:39:40.888]  It was done by two world-renowned economists.
[00:39:41.608 --> 00:39:43.689]  And again, the sovereign individual.
[00:39:43.729 --> 00:39:46.931]  And I read it, and I was amazed by what they exposed in there.
[00:39:47.191 --> 00:40:01.478]  Especially about Hillary Clinton, who's, you know... But I remember my dad, you know, who was like mainline, going around giving anti-communist speeches in Texas, and going on the Dallas radio when he was like 15 years old, and in America... Your dad did that?
[00:40:01.818 --> 00:40:02.138]  Oh yeah.
[00:40:02.258 --> 00:40:02.538]  Really?
[00:40:02.738 --> 00:40:04.519]  Yeah.
[00:40:04.719 --> 00:40:10.462]  And the point is, and then he stopped doing it once he went to college and got married and had me and stuff, and then my sister later.
[00:40:10.502 --> 00:40:16.805]  The point was, he got married, had kids, and kind of moved on, but the point was, he bought into the whole thing that America's the good guys.
[00:40:17.125 --> 00:40:21.647]  The point is, that was the perfect cover for criminals to come in and take over the government.
[00:40:22.027 --> 00:40:26.429]  Here's another person I want to interview, Mark Mazzetti, Pulitzer Prize winner.
[00:40:27.009 --> 00:40:37.553]  The way of the knife, the CIA, a secret army and the war at the ends of the earth, admitting that they're just killing people all over the world with assassination teams illegally, including here in America.
[00:40:37.813 --> 00:40:42.055]  And then you have Michael Hastings saying, I've got big breaking news.
[00:40:42.335 --> 00:40:43.815]  I'm going off the radar into hiding.
[00:40:44.095 --> 00:40:45.896]  They're coming and visiting my family and friends.
[00:40:45.936 --> 00:40:46.496]  He said there are.
[00:40:46.556 --> 00:40:48.217]  And then the FBI lied and said, no, we're not.
[00:40:48.797 --> 00:40:51.779]  And then his car, an hour and 45 minutes later, blows up.
[00:40:52.039 --> 00:40:53.940]  Witnesses said it was driving down the road and blew up.
[00:40:54.481 --> 00:40:55.301]  It's up against a tree.
[00:40:55.321 --> 00:40:56.062]  It didn't run into the tree.
[00:40:56.082 --> 00:40:56.362]  You can see it.
[00:40:56.402 --> 00:40:57.563]  It came to the rest against a tree.
[00:40:58.183 --> 00:41:00.404]  The engine's blown almost 60 yards down the road.
[00:41:01.305 --> 00:41:03.446]  And they say, day one, don't investigate.
[00:41:04.407 --> 00:41:05.528]  Alex Jones is a kook.
[00:41:06.068 --> 00:41:07.089]  It's natural causes.
[00:41:07.409 --> 00:41:11.812]  What do you make of things like that when Aaron Swartz is exposing
[00:41:12.924 --> 00:41:30.613]  The, uh, scams in the NSA and the spying, and he's a leader, and had a lot of money because he started Reddit, and then he says, I'm gonna fight the FBI and the Feds coming after me, I'm gonna fight the Justice Department saying I've committed, you know, crimes, releasing info, and I'm getting married, and then they come and he's hung, and they immediately say, oh, he hung himself.
[00:41:31.013 --> 00:41:31.233]  Yeah.
[00:41:31.434 --> 00:41:33.396]  I mean, I think there's death squads.
[00:41:33.416 --> 00:41:35.058]  Another one of those accidental hangings.
[00:41:35.499 --> 00:41:36.900]  You know, but... Like the D.C.
[00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:37.161]  Madame.
[00:41:37.181 --> 00:41:38.763]  I mean, what do you make of this?
[00:41:38.783 --> 00:41:40.505]  Because it's definitely, they're killing a lot of people.
[00:41:40.825 --> 00:41:42.848]  I mean, this is, Gary Webb got shot twice in the head.
[00:41:43.373 --> 00:41:48.038]  Well, that's why I'd like, you know, it takes you back to the Vince Foster assassination.
[00:41:48.498 --> 00:41:52.522]  You know, I would really like you to have Mike Zulu on.
[00:41:52.542 --> 00:41:53.583]  You haven't had him on, right?
[00:41:53.643 --> 00:41:55.425]  The detective, Cold Case Fosse detective?
[00:41:55.825 --> 00:41:56.546]  No, I want to get him on.
[00:41:56.566 --> 00:41:56.906]  Yeah.
[00:41:57.066 --> 00:41:57.987]  Let's write all this down.
[00:41:58.007 --> 00:42:00.069]  Let's get... I can help you line that up, too.
[00:42:01.150 --> 00:42:04.013]  But he spoke at our CSPOA convention.
[00:42:04.033 --> 00:42:05.134]  I want people to remember that.
[00:42:05.314 --> 00:42:06.515]  C-S-P-O-A.
[00:42:07.616 --> 00:42:11.798]  C as in Charlie, S as in Sam, P as in Paul, O as in Oscar, A as in Adam.
[00:42:11.878 --> 00:42:15.900]  CSPOA, the Constitutional Sheriff's Peace Officers Association.
[00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:17.260]  How evil!
[00:42:17.681 --> 00:42:18.161]  Oh, I know!
[00:42:18.321 --> 00:42:20.302]  You swear to it and now you're going to follow it?
[00:42:20.662 --> 00:42:21.222]  Oh my goodness!
[00:42:21.242 --> 00:42:22.303]  That's a dirty idea!
[00:42:23.723 --> 00:42:33.946]  But Mike Zullo presented his evidence to us all there, and we just said, look, this is not a required seminar to attend his class.
[00:42:34.446 --> 00:42:35.286]  Just go and see.
[00:42:35.546 --> 00:42:37.647]  If you don't want to go, if you're afraid of this, don't go.
[00:42:37.927 --> 00:42:42.988]  Well, it was the biggest attended class we had, and that was Saturday after the big day on Friday.
[00:42:43.468 --> 00:42:45.469]  So I am working on that.
[00:42:45.549 --> 00:42:46.749]  We're trying to get this exposed.
[00:42:47.709 --> 00:42:56.164]  Back before the investigation started, the truth is, the same people who asked Sheriff Arpaio to investigate this came to me first.
[00:42:56.945 --> 00:42:59.209]  And I was living in Fredericksburg, as you recall, at that time.
[00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:01.092]  And this was just a year and a half ago.
[00:43:02.108 --> 00:43:06.130]  And I told him I didn't have time to do it, and I'd have to drop everything, and I'd have to charge him.
[00:43:06.171 --> 00:43:07.972]  And they go, well, who would do this for free?
[00:43:08.012 --> 00:43:09.473]  And we're thinking about asking our pilot.
[00:43:09.493 --> 00:43:10.313]  I said, he won't do it.
[00:43:10.673 --> 00:43:11.834]  I said, he won't get involved in this.
[00:43:11.874 --> 00:43:13.515]  I've talked to him about this issue before.
[00:43:13.935 --> 00:43:15.376]  He thinks it's a bogus issue.
[00:43:15.756 --> 00:43:25.742]  But when he had 150, 200 people from the local Tea Party came, and they showed him some evidence that they really distrusted about the... And then notice how Obama came after him.
[00:43:26.042 --> 00:43:26.423]  Oh, I know.
[00:43:27.023 --> 00:43:28.684]  Because that is a fake birth certificate.
[00:43:28.784 --> 00:43:29.345]  Oh, totally.
[00:43:29.385 --> 00:43:31.647]  First they said they'd released it when they hadn't.
[00:43:31.687 --> 00:43:33.428]  They released a receipt of one.
[00:43:33.608 --> 00:43:33.788]  Right.
[00:43:34.029 --> 00:43:35.550]  That you go and print out as a computer.
[00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:37.151]  Like, I've got to get them for my kids.
[00:43:37.191 --> 00:43:38.672]  You go and they print out a receipt.
[00:43:38.872 --> 00:43:39.072]  Yeah.
[00:43:39.553 --> 00:43:41.755]  The Bureau of Physic says here's your receipt from the health department.
[00:43:43.096 --> 00:43:44.057]  Well, you've been working on it.
[00:43:44.097 --> 00:43:45.278]  Tell people what we know.
[00:43:45.478 --> 00:43:48.941]  Well, the thing of it is, the one really working it is Mike Zullo.
[00:43:49.261 --> 00:43:55.047]  And he's a former detective and he's working for free for Sheriff Arpaio on his cold case posse.
[00:43:55.687 --> 00:44:00.912]  And so Arpaio told his people and told me at the time, he said, look, these people asked me.
[00:44:00.932 --> 00:44:01.653]  I said, I know.
[00:44:01.793 --> 00:44:03.915]  I said, I'm surprised you took it because I told him you wouldn't.
[00:44:04.375 --> 00:44:08.536]  He says, well, he says, just to get him off my back, I told him I'd investigate it.
[00:44:08.916 --> 00:44:12.036]  But I'm sure I'm just going to clear the president and everything's going to be fine.
[00:44:12.476 --> 00:44:16.537]  Well, the investigator did a thorough investigation and it turned out to be just the opposite.
[00:44:16.977 --> 00:44:24.378]  That's when I bought onto it because I knew Arpaio was an honest man and that he would do this thoroughly and professionally.
[00:44:24.979 --> 00:44:28.099]  And Zulo has done a marvelous investigation.
[00:44:28.479 --> 00:44:30.820]  He's taken the birth certificate apart.
[00:44:31.220 --> 00:44:33.460]  Why would they put out such a bad fake, though?
[00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:43.032]  Well, you know, I think they used a computer specialist that is young, okay, and didn't know typesetting off a computer.
[00:44:43.052 --> 00:44:44.714]  Because here's how I knew it was fake day one.
[00:44:44.954 --> 00:44:46.035]  They used the fake...
[00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:49.642]  Uh, system that comes in the fonts.
[00:44:50.342 --> 00:44:51.863]  Correct, the typing font.
[00:44:52.143 --> 00:44:53.264]  Back in those days.
[00:44:53.985 --> 00:45:03.691]  Yeah, it's meant to look like typing, but it's the computer font because the letters are identical and the splats from a real typewriter are like snowflakes or fingerprints.
[00:45:04.111 --> 00:45:05.452]  I mean, it's horribly fake!
[00:45:05.692 --> 00:45:08.695]  And Zulu takes it nine layers.
[00:45:09.175 --> 00:45:12.038]  He takes the whole thing and it was layered nine times.
[00:45:12.478 --> 00:45:15.641]  And he takes it and shows you the mistake of all nine layers.
[00:45:16.622 --> 00:45:18.264]  But why did they do something so fake?
[00:45:18.804 --> 00:45:19.725]  We found it day one.
[00:45:19.825 --> 00:45:23.689]  Well, when you look at his face, if you just went in and showed it to Obama,
[00:45:24.289 --> 00:45:27.370]  He'll look at it and go, oh my gosh, this is great!
[00:45:27.830 --> 00:45:28.610]  This looks good!
[00:45:29.010 --> 00:45:33.212]  You just have to start peeling off the layers, and then you get an entire different view.
[00:45:33.712 --> 00:45:41.754]  So whoever it was, it was a young computer tech, and they thought, you know, no one went back to it and did, peeled off the layers.
[00:45:42.094 --> 00:45:43.035]  They said, oh, that'll work.
[00:45:43.495 --> 00:45:48.896]  So they didn't do their homework, and they just had to get something out, and they... And then even left it in layers!
[00:45:48.956 --> 00:45:49.597]  Yes, yeah.
[00:45:49.817 --> 00:45:50.457]  It's crazy!
[00:45:51.397 --> 00:45:53.019]  It was not a good job at all.
[00:45:53.839 --> 00:45:56.321]  So you have to kind of wonder who proofread that for him.
[00:45:56.862 --> 00:46:00.865]  But Obama needed to release something, and he did, and they just rushed it.
[00:46:01.806 --> 00:46:08.512]  And so what we don't say, and what you need to remember on all of this investigation, all of your listeners need to remember this.
[00:46:08.972 --> 00:46:14.356]  We are not, and this investigation is not, saying where Mr. Obama was born.
[00:46:15.017 --> 00:46:19.961]  We're saying that the birth certificate the White House released is a fraud, a fake, and a lie.
[00:46:19.981 --> 00:46:21.322]  Have you seen Dreams of My Real Father?
[00:46:21.362 --> 00:46:21.863]  We sell it.
[00:46:22.203 --> 00:46:22.704]  Oh, of course.
[00:46:22.764 --> 00:46:25.846]  I mean, that's his mom, and that's that house, and that's the photos.
[00:46:25.946 --> 00:46:27.468]  I think that's what it is.
[00:46:27.708 --> 00:46:28.488]  Yeah.
[00:46:28.509 --> 00:46:34.434]  So, no wonder the Kenya thing, that's why his wife said it in speeches and why it was in the Harvard deal, that was the diversion.
[00:46:34.674 --> 00:46:34.834]  Yeah.
[00:46:35.074 --> 00:46:40.298]  The truth was, he had a different name, different dad, famous communist, I mean, oh man.
[00:46:40.498 --> 00:46:44.541]  And Obama would spend the summers with him, a communist pornographer.
[00:46:46.463 --> 00:46:48.864]  Now you know he used his dad's name, Barry Sotero.
[00:46:49.145 --> 00:46:52.167]  I mean, that's Obama's name that he used to go to college.
[00:46:52.687 --> 00:47:02.554]  And so it's amazing that still, even the mainstream press, even people like Chris Matthews, who give this guy a free ride, and yet we know he used an alias.
[00:47:02.574 --> 00:47:04.196]  The only president ever
[00:47:04.696 --> 00:47:05.557]  To use an AK.
[00:47:05.637 --> 00:47:06.958]  Well, he had at least two other ones.
[00:47:07.358 --> 00:47:07.898]  Yeah.
[00:47:07.978 --> 00:47:11.561]  I mean, this guy... Who do you think he really is?
[00:47:11.621 --> 00:47:13.762]  Because, I mean, this guy looks like a Manchurian candidate.
[00:47:14.663 --> 00:47:16.044]  I think he was raised up for this.
[00:47:16.484 --> 00:47:18.405]  You know, I think he was groomed by somebody.
[00:47:18.585 --> 00:47:22.988]  And, you know, when you look at... Well, no kidding, he was surrounded by top communists.
[00:47:23.088 --> 00:47:23.429]  Davis.
[00:47:23.789 --> 00:47:24.789]  Yeah, wasn't it Davis?
[00:47:24.809 --> 00:47:26.150]  Yeah, Davis, but then you got the Weatherman.
[00:47:26.511 --> 00:47:28.232]  As soon as he gets to... I mean, it's just...
[00:47:28.732 --> 00:47:34.253]  I mean, if you look at the people he was around, then you have to know, this was no accident.
[00:47:34.714 --> 00:47:35.514]  This was all planned.
[00:47:36.034 --> 00:47:38.314]  There's no coincidences in this government.
[00:47:38.394 --> 00:47:39.475]  There's no accidents.
[00:47:39.895 --> 00:47:42.956]  This was all devised and planned.
[00:47:43.656 --> 00:47:47.937]  And here he is, doing what he was told, doing what he was raised to do, destroy America.
[00:47:48.857 --> 00:47:49.617]  And boy, they are.
[00:47:49.717 --> 00:47:57.199]  I mean, this Obamacare written to rip everybody off and make everybody go to part-time, and it's meant to hammer the poor, and then they say it's for the poor.
[00:47:57.659 --> 00:48:00.959]  And this immigration thing, all this free stuff for unlimited millions.
[00:48:00.979 --> 00:48:01.360]  It's for the poor.
[00:48:01.380 --> 00:48:02.420]  It's to make us all poor.
[00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:05.100]  It's to increase the poor.
[00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:13.262]  And yeah, you know, right now we're having so much of this happen that so many sheriffs and local officials are waking up
[00:48:13.962 --> 00:48:14.702]  To the solution.
[00:48:15.102 --> 00:48:16.543]  And I am so proud.
[00:48:16.563 --> 00:48:17.623]  And that's nullification.
[00:48:18.023 --> 00:48:20.303]  Sheriff nullification, state nullification.
[00:48:20.323 --> 00:48:22.204]  Because they can't go after all the sheriffs.
[00:48:22.484 --> 00:48:30.346]  I mean, if they can have 800 plus cities that are sanctuary where the illegals are above the law, why couldn't we have 800 cities where we ignore unconstitutional federal stuff?
[00:48:30.606 --> 00:48:33.726]  I mean, they're ignoring the law with the illegals and breaking the law.
[00:48:34.046 --> 00:48:36.047]  How about we ignore unconstitutional stuff?
[00:48:36.713 --> 00:48:37.213]  Absolutely.
[00:48:37.773 --> 00:48:38.793]  It should be done that way.
[00:48:40.554 --> 00:48:46.835]  My lawsuit was an amazing miracle, but I do not recommend that sheriffs or local officials sue anymore.
[00:48:47.315 --> 00:48:48.396]  We tell them no.
[00:48:48.576 --> 00:48:49.756]  We erect the barriers.
[00:48:49.796 --> 00:48:53.757]  That's the name of our new DVD set from our convention, Erecting the Barriers.
[00:48:54.157 --> 00:48:56.917]  That actually is a warning that came to us from James Madison.
[00:48:57.257 --> 00:49:02.198]  We can safely rely on local officials to erect the barriers against the encroachments of the federal government.
[00:49:02.639 --> 00:49:03.179]  That's what he
[00:49:04.919 --> 00:49:06.620]  Espoused, and that's what we espouse.
[00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:11.422]  That's why there's three branches federally, and then you've got multiple branches locally, because you don't want every one group.
[00:49:11.462 --> 00:49:12.862]  They're always saying, get rid of gridlock.
[00:49:13.182 --> 00:49:14.283]  Let the government do whatever it wants.
[00:49:14.343 --> 00:49:15.623]  That's called Napoleon.
[00:49:15.924 --> 00:49:16.764]  That's called Hitler.
[00:49:16.844 --> 00:49:18.024]  You do not want that.
[00:49:18.284 --> 00:49:19.025]  I love gridlock.
[00:49:19.205 --> 00:49:20.145]  I wish that I'll go home.
[00:49:20.765 --> 00:49:23.106]  The gridlock was so strong that they would just have to go home.
[00:49:23.507 --> 00:49:25.427]  We're a lot safer when Congress goes home.
[00:49:26.068 --> 00:49:27.908]  And I don't want to hear they're doing this to fight Al Qaeda.
[00:49:28.188 --> 00:49:31.810]  What do you make of the fact that now it's admitted the government runs the main Al Qaeda?
[00:49:32.830 --> 00:49:36.733]  Well, you know, I haven't seen the entire evidence on that.
[00:49:36.773 --> 00:49:39.835]  I haven't seen the... Well, it's on record that they're using Al-Qaeda in Syria.
[00:49:40.175 --> 00:49:44.838]  Well, we do know that there's 35 terrorist Al-Qaeda camps here in America.
[00:49:45.279 --> 00:49:47.380]  At least 35 that the government has documented.
[00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:48.521]  So there's probably more.
[00:49:48.981 --> 00:49:54.405]  But they're there, and why doesn't... If the government's going after terrorists, then why don't they go after these Al-Qaeda... Well, it's the same thing in England.
[00:49:54.425 --> 00:49:57.127]  They have radical guys on TV saying, kill everybody, take over.
[00:49:57.167 --> 00:49:57.987]  They leave them on TV.
[00:49:58.108 --> 00:49:59.529]  And it's the same thing here.
[00:49:59.569 --> 00:50:00.689]  They've got those guys over here.
[00:50:00.769 --> 00:50:01.310]  I'm telling you,
[00:50:02.645 --> 00:50:06.586]  It's on record that now it's come out that they're running these guys.
[00:50:07.987 --> 00:50:13.009]  How could 35 terrorist camps exist in America if they're not approved?
[00:50:13.109 --> 00:50:14.790]  No, I've seen those on California.
[00:50:15.230 --> 00:50:22.192]  I've seen the California news shows the guys, jihadis, running with the machine guns and doing all the training and preaching we're going to take over America.
[00:50:22.492 --> 00:50:22.873]  They're here.
[00:50:24.073 --> 00:50:26.474]  But then I have to lose my rights with the TSA.
[00:50:27.054 --> 00:50:28.215]  They're using it to take our rights.
[00:50:29.415 --> 00:50:40.100]  Right now, and I fly all the time, and this is something that I've just come up with, that it's easier for a terrorist to enter America, especially through our southern border, than it is for you and me to get on an airplane.
[00:50:40.881 --> 00:50:41.601]  Isn't that amazing?
[00:50:42.381 --> 00:50:52.146]  American citizens, someone like me, who's dedicated his life to law enforcement and keeping the peace, it's easier for a terrorist to get into America than it is for me to get on an airplane.
[00:50:52.970 --> 00:50:56.914]  Well, that's because they're using the terrorist threat, the synthetic threat, to take our rights.
[00:50:57.214 --> 00:51:00.137]  We're going to do two more segments to take your phone calls.
[00:51:00.217 --> 00:51:02.800]  Paul, Joseph, David.
[00:51:04.301 --> 00:51:05.702]  We're going to get to all of you straight ahead.
[00:51:05.742 --> 00:51:06.463]  Thank you for holding.
[00:51:06.623 --> 00:51:08.025]  Sheriff Richard Mack is our guest.
[00:51:08.525 --> 00:51:10.327]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[00:51:10.867 --> 00:51:12.049]  A lot of breaking news.

[00:51:35.355 --> 00:51:36.255]  Enhancing health and privacy.
[00:51:42.017 --> 00:51:51.283]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:51:51.343 --> 00:51:58.288]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:51:58.428 --> 00:51:59.189]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:51:59.209 --> 00:52:02.311]  I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[00:52:02.371 --> 00:52:03.291]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.

[00:52:13.118 --> 00:52:16.261]  Oklahoma reminds us there are many kinds of storms in our lives.
[00:52:16.601 --> 00:52:19.203]  Nature regularly sends us destructive storms.
[00:52:19.744 --> 00:52:22.266]  24 hours before a storm strikes, people panic.
[00:52:22.566 --> 00:52:25.789]  It would be wise to prepare ahead of the panic curve.
[00:52:25.969 --> 00:52:32.195]  The food price storm, from drought and livestock problems, is forecast to hit ridiculous heights by the end of the summer.
[00:52:32.475 --> 00:52:34.137]  Wonder if there will really be a problem?

[00:53:11.817 --> 00:53:14.020]  What's safer and cheaper than prescription drugs?
[00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:15.301]  Glad you asked.
[00:53:15.742 --> 00:53:17.804]  The answer is renovation teas.
[00:53:18.124 --> 00:53:22.049]  Herbal remedies are much safer and much cheaper than prescription drugs.
[00:53:22.309 --> 00:53:26.374]  Tastes great and most importantly herbal teas are effective and non-addictive.
[00:53:26.614 --> 00:53:29.478]  Renovation tea is especially unique and here's why.
[00:53:29.818 --> 00:53:33.099]  We spent years researching herbs and their beneficial properties.

[00:54:15.322 --> 00:54:21.367]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:54:21.947 --> 00:54:24.930]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:35.253]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you're watching on TV, here is from the 1980s a G.I.
[00:54:35.293 --> 00:54:37.634]  Joe Cobra-ish armored vehicle.
[00:54:37.654 --> 00:54:40.016]  And if you notice, that's how the police dress now.
[00:54:40.036 --> 00:54:41.116]  It's like a Cobra Trooper.
[00:54:41.737 --> 00:54:43.338]  That's how terrorists dressed in the 80s.
[00:54:43.978 --> 00:54:49.781]  And this is how the armored vehicles that were in Boston, that everybody saw, that's exactly how they look.
[00:54:49.821 --> 00:54:52.122]  So we'll roll some of that footage over that.
[00:54:53.123 --> 00:54:55.904]  And you see in all the movies this image of martial law.
[00:54:56.245 --> 00:54:58.446]  Sheriff Mac, they're really trying to pump us for that, aren't they?
[00:54:59.164 --> 00:55:04.786]  It's amazing how much is being exposed by Hollywood in the movies that they're putting out lately.
[00:55:05.247 --> 00:55:09.969]  It's really amazing stuff just like this and Enemy of the State.
[00:55:10.089 --> 00:55:15.651]  I mean, that was done about 10 years ago, but a lot of exposure from Hollywood, which I don't understand.
[00:55:15.891 --> 00:55:24.537]  What did you make of the Boston bombing and then taking half the city and locking it down and aiming guns at people that didn't even meet the description?
[00:55:24.577 --> 00:55:30.662]  Or Dorner, a black guy they're looking for, and they shoot up white women and Hispanic women in cars that don't even match it.
[00:55:30.922 --> 00:55:32.483]  I mean, what type of mentality is that?
[00:55:32.483 --> 00:55:40.247]  Well, I think the whole thing is just that, the conditioning of our own psyche for the American citizen to be expecting more of that, to be ready for more of that.
[00:55:40.687 --> 00:55:44.389]  Going in people's homes, no knock, you know, no warrants, no nothing.
[00:55:44.710 --> 00:55:49.772]  Just going in, drawing down on everybody, checking their homes without the owner's permission.
[00:55:49.792 --> 00:55:51.653]  And it's all about the officer's safety.
[00:55:52.654 --> 00:55:55.255]  The danger to the officers is going into a tyranny.
[00:55:56.016 --> 00:55:58.477]  They're not giving you all this unconstitutional power for no reason.
[00:55:58.677 --> 00:56:00.038]  They're going to gut the country.
[00:56:00.918 --> 00:56:03.300]  And the police academies teach that, I'm afraid.
[00:56:04.101 --> 00:56:05.101]  You go home at night.
[00:56:05.462 --> 00:56:07.303]  The most important thing is you go home at night.
[00:56:07.563 --> 00:56:16.790]  There's a lot more important things than you going home at night, and that is, one, keeping your oath to protect and defend the God... Absolutely, because if you don't, you lose everything!
[00:56:16.890 --> 00:56:17.250]  Of course.
[00:56:18.171 --> 00:56:22.935]  And I heard you talking with George Norrie earlier, and exactly what you said about that.
[00:56:23.755 --> 00:56:26.476]  These people need to understand our families are at stake also.
[00:56:27.076 --> 00:56:31.917]  The law enforcement community, the sheriff's community, all of them need to understand we have a stake in this.
[00:56:32.137 --> 00:56:33.798]  This is for our kids and our grandkids.
[00:56:34.158 --> 00:56:36.219]  Norrie said he had five grandkids, I have ten.
[00:56:36.519 --> 00:56:37.079]  I have ten.
[00:56:37.799 --> 00:56:43.221]  And I can't believe it, you know, my pretty little blonde girl wife's only 55 and she's got ten grandkids, you know.
[00:56:44.541 --> 00:56:45.563]  That's why I'm here, Alex.
[00:56:46.143 --> 00:56:46.804]  That's why I'm here.
[00:56:46.824 --> 00:56:50.549]  I love my five children and my ten grandkids, and I want them to have a future.
[00:56:50.569 --> 00:56:53.493]  Well, look at how they target police and military after they're out.
[00:56:53.533 --> 00:56:55.396]  They hate you, because you're trained.
[00:56:55.456 --> 00:56:56.697]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:56:57.435 --> 00:57:00.277]  This is real authoritarianism happening in America, folks.
[00:57:00.297 --> 00:57:01.518]  Look how they hate Joe Arpaio.
[00:57:01.999 --> 00:57:07.963]  I mean, they've been going after Joe Arpaio for four and a half years now, investigating him for one thing or another.
[00:57:08.324 --> 00:57:11.386]  Then they put on this sham called this recall against him.
[00:57:11.666 --> 00:57:12.547]  He beats him there.
[00:57:12.887 --> 00:57:13.768]  He always wins.
[00:57:13.808 --> 00:57:15.009]  He always lands on his feet.
[00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:18.172]  The guy just turned 81 years old and he's still going strong.
[00:57:18.192 --> 00:57:18.992]  Doesn't look like he's 80.
[00:57:19.313 --> 00:57:19.433]  No.
[00:57:19.853 --> 00:57:22.354]  A lot of people that know Joe, and they say he's the real deal.
[00:57:22.734 --> 00:57:23.014]  He is.
[00:57:23.254 --> 00:57:23.574]  He is.
[00:57:23.954 --> 00:57:31.797]  I promise you, unless he's totally blown me away with his superficial nature, I'll tell you what.
[00:57:32.697 --> 00:57:35.098]  He, I've never met a more genuine person.
[00:57:35.858 --> 00:57:37.358]  I'm just telling you, that's who he is.
[00:57:37.978 --> 00:57:38.859]  Tell us about this teacher.
[00:57:38.879 --> 00:57:40.119]  We're going to go to break and take a few calls.
[00:57:40.139 --> 00:57:40.759]  I apologize.
[00:57:40.779 --> 00:57:42.880]  He becomes a member of the CSPOA.
[00:57:44.866 --> 00:57:46.007]  That's a good-looking shirt.
[00:57:46.027 --> 00:57:47.848]  Who's your graphics person?
[00:57:49.009 --> 00:58:00.117]  Actually, Sheriff Christopher, who we're helping out in Delaware, who we're trying to save his job and career and all that, who's been attacked by Bo Biden, we're helping him and his wife actually design this for us.
[00:58:00.678 --> 00:58:08.704]  And so if anybody becomes a member, hey, I love that shot, go to cspoa.org, become a member, and you get the shirt free.
[00:58:08.744 --> 00:58:09.605]  We'll send it out to you.
[00:58:10.546 --> 00:58:10.806]  Awesome.
[00:58:12.401 --> 00:58:13.882]  That's mine, I only wear it around the house.
[00:58:13.922 --> 00:58:14.543]  Yeah, it's yours.
[00:58:14.563 --> 00:58:17.105]  The police will freak out if I'm walking around with a sheriff's shirt on.
[00:58:17.125 --> 00:58:18.146]  You can wear it fishing.
[00:58:18.166 --> 00:58:18.827]  You can wear it fishing.
[00:58:19.388 --> 00:58:20.409]  It's a good looking shirt, actually.
[00:58:20.429 --> 00:58:23.732]  Rex told me you like to go fishing, so you gotta wear that and go fishing.
[00:58:23.952 --> 00:58:24.653]  Absolutely.
[00:58:24.833 --> 00:58:27.015]  There you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:58:27.075 --> 00:58:28.116]  I guess it's time to do it anyways.
[00:58:28.136 --> 00:58:29.918]  That is my son's name, Rex Jones, folks.
[00:58:30.478 --> 00:58:31.299]  He's great, isn't he?
[00:58:31.339 --> 00:58:32.580]  Oh, lovely kid, yes.
[00:58:32.760 --> 00:58:33.821]  What a smart kid.
[00:58:34.062 --> 00:58:35.283]  Yeah, he's a sweetheart.
[00:58:36.668 --> 00:58:39.489]  My book's dedicated to him, so his name's always been hiding in plain view.
[00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:41.430]  Somebody has taught that kid well.
[00:58:41.951 --> 00:58:43.711]  Oh, he's much better than I ever was.
[00:58:43.751 --> 00:58:44.472]  He's going to be amazing.
[00:58:45.072 --> 00:58:47.393]  I'm telling you, God has really given me the next generation.
[00:58:47.453 --> 00:58:48.594]  He wants to fight the New World Order.
[00:58:48.634 --> 00:58:50.114]  I want to know what his IQ is.
[00:58:50.134 --> 00:58:51.155]  We'll be right back.

[01:00:04.957 --> 01:00:06.301]  Direct from Austin.
[01:00:07.023 --> 01:00:10.231]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:00:18.257 --> 01:00:22.442]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:23.083 --> 01:00:23.904]  You want answers?
[01:00:24.685 --> 01:00:25.606]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:26.227 --> 01:00:29.871]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:30.432 --> 01:00:34.476]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:37.119 --> 01:00:42.624]  Well, Edward Snowden tells the press in an online press conference that the truth is coming out.
[01:00:42.664 --> 01:00:45.607]  The government can't stop by murdering me.
[01:00:45.627 --> 01:00:48.309]  But he goes on to say they want to murder him.
[01:00:48.329 --> 01:00:52.012]  The Chinese government's come out and said he's not working for them.
[01:00:53.024 --> 01:00:54.905]  And said it's ridiculous that Dick Cheney said that.
[01:00:54.945 --> 01:00:57.445]  If anybody's working for the Communist Chinese, it's Dick Cheney.
[01:00:58.126 --> 01:01:01.207]  And the Bushes and all them opening up China and selling us out to them.
[01:01:01.687 --> 01:01:02.727]  Bill Clinton, all of them.
[01:01:02.767 --> 01:01:03.547]  It's just ridiculous.
[01:01:04.067 --> 01:01:06.128]  Give up your rights to the military industrial complex.
[01:01:06.148 --> 01:01:07.869]  The Chinese Communists will get us.
[01:01:08.469 --> 01:01:09.929]  The globalists put them in power.
[01:01:10.610 --> 01:01:11.830]  Kicked out Chiang Kai-shek.
[01:01:13.644 --> 01:01:14.245]  Unbelievable.
[01:01:14.865 --> 01:01:18.628]  That's just some of what is coming up on that front.
[01:01:18.648 --> 01:01:21.571]  We're going to be joined as well by Max Keiser.
[01:01:22.272 --> 01:01:26.395]  He's got a new article out that's just went up on InfoWars.com.
[01:01:27.196 --> 01:01:35.123]  The collapse of the current Bankster regime is upon us, is his headline, and he wrote this article for InfoWars.com, so we've
[01:01:36.274 --> 01:01:39.377]  We've got that article up there right now.
[01:01:39.477 --> 01:01:40.798]  He will be joining us.
[01:01:41.159 --> 01:01:49.146]  He said you'd see a dollar plunge and a worldwide stock market plunge starting at the end of April, early May, and he'll tell you that he's a month and a half off.
[01:01:49.166 --> 01:01:50.427]  That's what he was saying a week and a half ago.
[01:01:50.487 --> 01:01:54.271]  I still wasn't convinced completely, but more and more I hope he's wrong.
[01:01:54.591 --> 01:01:59.236]  Even though it's a fiat system, we're riding on top of it.
[01:02:00.487 --> 01:02:07.933]  And it's just that the Federal Reserve hinting at ending QE4 or QE Unlimited or
[01:02:13.171 --> 01:02:18.093]  QE Infinity, which is just free money to them that they loan out to us at 10, 20, 30 percent.
[01:02:19.514 --> 01:02:29.599]  Just hinting at that to show how kept we are, how controlled we are by these foreign offshore banks has set the stock market the last few weeks, as you know, going downward.
[01:02:29.619 --> 01:02:35.441]  So we're going to be looking at that with Max Keiser here in the next segment.
[01:02:35.501 --> 01:02:41.104]  First, I'll get into the latest NSA news as well.
[01:02:42.631 --> 01:02:52.517]  And again, I got into the fact, just to illustrate who the globalists are, they knew blowing up nerve gas caches would maim and kill many of our troops and debilitate them.
[01:02:52.537 --> 01:02:54.077]  That's now admitted in the New York Times.
[01:02:54.638 --> 01:02:55.818]  Just shows you who these people are.
[01:02:56.299 --> 01:02:59.521]  California allows up to a thousand times glyphosate that they know.
[01:03:00.721 --> 01:03:03.623]  A thousand times lesser massively increases breast cancer.
[01:03:04.183 --> 01:03:10.467]  Venezuela considers banning baby bottle feeding because it makes the brain smaller, the IQ is lower, and the children are unhealthy.
[01:03:11.167 --> 01:03:18.031]  Yeah, it's all done by the eugenicist to have the working class basically brain damage the children.
[01:03:18.091 --> 01:03:20.372]  And they've known this for 50, 60 years.
[01:03:20.732 --> 01:03:21.693]  Of course they've known it.
[01:03:22.653 --> 01:03:27.996]  How many controversies have they had where babies... Guys, will you print me an article on this because it sounds insane.
[01:03:28.657 --> 01:03:31.498]  Just type in baby formula, baby deaths.
[01:03:32.119 --> 01:03:36.961]  You'll see stuff in China and India and Africa where the globalists really sell the bad stuff.
[01:03:37.642 --> 01:03:39.463]  Where the babies just die.
[01:03:40.396 --> 01:03:53.820]  Here, they know that'd be a little too obvious, so they just, you know, get ready to have, um, one of the people getting, you know, diabetes when they're five, well, you're getting, you know, 75% high fructose corn syrup and sugar in the average baby formula.
[01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:55.721]  I mean, of course, your pancreas is dead on arrival.
[01:03:57.722 --> 01:03:59.882]  But what's wrong with having your arms and legs sawed off?
[01:03:59.902 --> 01:04:04.384]  I mean, you know, I got a buddy right now who's got diabetes, might have to get his toe chopped off.
[01:04:05.981 --> 01:04:06.641]  What's wrong with that?
[01:04:06.681 --> 01:04:07.562]  That's loving and liberal.
[01:04:08.142 --> 01:04:08.642]  It's trendy.
[01:04:08.662 --> 01:04:11.383]  I mean, what's wrong with Bayer putting HIV in the shots for hemophiliacs?
[01:04:11.563 --> 01:04:11.984]  It's loving.
[01:04:12.884 --> 01:04:13.404]  It's trendy.
[01:04:13.424 --> 01:04:15.605]  Of course, I'm being sickeningly sarcastic.
[01:04:15.905 --> 01:04:16.946]  This stuff gets to me.
[01:04:17.446 --> 01:04:18.767]  And that's what I'm talking about.
[01:04:18.907 --> 01:04:19.967]  That's what I'm exposing.
[01:04:20.287 --> 01:04:21.288]  That's what I'm angry about.
[01:04:21.348 --> 01:04:23.449]  So I'm recapping that for people that joined us.
[01:04:23.489 --> 01:04:27.330]  But I've got about 15 stacks of news here I've not yet gotten to.
[01:04:27.350 --> 01:04:32.413]  And we're going to go over it all with Max Keiser on the other side of this quick break.
[01:04:32.433 --> 01:04:32.893]  But first,
[01:04:33.955 --> 01:04:35.236]  Is this his prediction?
[01:04:35.276 --> 01:04:37.959]  A month and a half late coming true?
[01:04:37.999 --> 01:04:40.781]  Another article by Paul Joseph Watson that just went up.
[01:04:40.821 --> 01:04:42.623]  Did Israel attack Syria again?
[01:04:43.103 --> 01:04:46.146]  Strike on advanced weapons shipment threatens huge escalation of conflict.
[01:04:46.486 --> 01:04:50.790]  The Saudi Arabians are announcing they're going to ship missiles to Al-Qaeda.
[01:04:53.472 --> 01:04:54.333]  Unbelievable!
[01:04:55.699 --> 01:04:57.881]  And when Al Qaeda blows up U.S.
[01:04:57.921 --> 01:05:04.065]  airliners with these missiles, will they invade a country not involved again, like Iraq?
[01:05:04.125 --> 01:05:04.485]  Probably.
[01:05:05.466 --> 01:05:08.708]  Probably, because there's a war against reality going on.
[01:05:09.269 --> 01:05:09.749]  Stay with us.
[01:05:09.809 --> 01:05:11.550]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, PrisonPlanet.tv.

[01:07:13.010 --> 01:07:19.975]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[01:07:20.235 --> 01:07:37.866]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[01:07:38.106 --> 01:07:42.229]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[01:07:42.489 --> 01:07:44.070]  And discovered Young-Jevity.

[01:08:10.108 --> 01:08:11.989]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[01:08:18.133 --> 01:08:18.794]  Big Brother.
[01:08:19.434 --> 01:08:20.495]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:21.216 --> 01:08:22.437]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:22.977 --> 01:08:23.818]  You want answers?
[01:08:24.578 --> 01:08:25.419]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:26.119 --> 01:08:29.722]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:30.303 --> 01:08:34.406]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:39.676 --> 01:08:43.177]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the second hour of this worldwide broadcast.
[01:08:43.257 --> 01:08:45.278]  It is Monday, the 17th day of June, 2013.
[01:08:45.778 --> 01:08:56.823]  We're going to be joined by market analyst and journalist Max Keiser here in a moment to talk about the world
[01:08:57.363 --> 01:09:07.151]  The economic condition is at the beginning of a crash that Max has been predicting for about a year that he thought would start in late April or early May.
[01:09:07.231 --> 01:09:08.492]  Was he late predicting it?
[01:09:08.952 --> 01:09:14.256]  His article on Infowars.com, the collapse of the current bankster regime is upon us.
[01:09:14.837 --> 01:09:16.818]  Well, they've been collapsing it by design, but...
[01:09:17.999 --> 01:09:18.879]  Too big to fail.
[01:09:18.919 --> 01:09:21.500]  We're going to talk to Max here in a moment.
[01:09:22.041 --> 01:09:27.322]  First off, Snowden gave a two-hour online press conference to the media.
[01:09:27.823 --> 01:09:30.244]  Business Insider linked up on DrudgeReport.com.
[01:09:30.264 --> 01:09:32.444]  We'll get it posted on InfoWars.com as well.
[01:09:33.185 --> 01:09:37.006]  The truth is coming and the government can't stop it by murdering me.
[01:09:37.386 --> 01:09:41.388]  And he went on to say a lot more is coming out and that
[01:09:42.870 --> 01:09:44.111]  He thinks they're going to try to kill him.
[01:09:44.131 --> 01:09:45.372]  Well, yeah, it came out in the news.
[01:09:45.773 --> 01:09:52.438]  The Daily Mail was at Dulles Airport and heard a bunch of government CIA spooks talking about how they want to kill him and how they're going to kill him.
[01:09:53.299 --> 01:09:57.102]  Yeah, it's a mafia, folks, of foreign banks that run the intelligence agencies.
[01:09:57.503 --> 01:09:59.885]  And the big secret about the NSA is not a secret at all.
[01:10:01.226 --> 01:10:03.828]  Thousands of major companies have partial access.
[01:10:03.868 --> 01:10:06.210]  The Fortune 100 have total access.
[01:10:06.270 --> 01:10:10.214]  And they make the money off of spying on everything and swapping the data.
[01:10:10.674 --> 01:10:12.476]  And then they use it to corner the market.
[01:10:12.756 --> 01:10:14.217]  And what did Bloomberg report on Friday?
[01:10:15.439 --> 01:10:18.001]  What Max Keiser and I have told you for a long time.
[01:10:18.721 --> 01:10:20.583]  The stock market is totally rigged.
[01:10:20.823 --> 01:10:21.844]  These companies are rigged.
[01:10:22.064 --> 01:10:25.447]  But only the big top insiders are allowed to have offshore bank accounts.
[01:10:28.579 --> 01:10:35.401]  Deals offshore with corporations and trust and tax shelters where they pay no taxes.
[01:10:35.701 --> 01:10:38.341]  General Electric, Google, Berkshire Hathaway.
[01:10:41.082 --> 01:10:44.183]  Only the insiders are allowed to use the inside info.
[01:10:44.243 --> 01:10:46.283]  So it's a globally gamed system.
[01:10:46.303 --> 01:10:52.624]  And it's not enough for the bankers to have unlimited fiat currency for themselves and to be able to create endless derivatives.
[01:10:52.664 --> 01:10:54.945]  They've expanded the derivatives market the last few years.
[01:10:56.561 --> 01:10:58.942]  It's not enough to have us then tied to their debt.
[01:11:01.283 --> 01:11:03.843]  Then they have all the inside data on everything.
[01:11:03.904 --> 01:11:12.466]  If a company's coming out with something that's going to block them, not part of the insiders, they try to buy it for pennies on the dollar, if they won't sell, boom, the IRS and regulators are turned loose on them.
[01:11:12.727 --> 01:11:14.227]  If that doesn't work, they just kill you.
[01:11:15.087 --> 01:11:16.368]  Industrial espionage.
[01:11:16.408 --> 01:11:19.689]  They call it a disruptive technology.
[01:11:21.328 --> 01:11:24.771]  Warehouses of incredible energy devices.
[01:11:24.851 --> 01:11:31.235]  Warehouses of incredible medical treatments that are then only given to the establishment.
[01:11:34.958 --> 01:11:38.040]  And that's what a major Russian tycoon is in the news talking about today.
[01:11:38.441 --> 01:11:41.323]  But they know you're going to want to have access to all this.
[01:11:41.683 --> 01:11:43.745]  That's why they're putting the police state grid in place.
[01:11:45.426 --> 01:11:45.886]  Look at this.
[01:11:46.086 --> 01:11:46.407]  GCHQ
[01:11:49.136 --> 01:11:52.699]  Intercepted foreign politicians' communications at G20 summits.
[01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:53.380]  Oh, really?
[01:11:53.900 --> 01:11:57.804]  And again, the idea is that America and England were spying for our countries.
[01:11:58.104 --> 01:12:02.348]  We're run by big megabanks who own subsidiaries in all these countries.
[01:12:03.429 --> 01:12:05.551]  They use it to make sure they get their outcome.
[01:12:05.571 --> 01:12:06.912]  Do you understand that?
[01:12:06.992 --> 01:12:08.594]  They're de-industrializing us.
[01:12:09.034 --> 01:12:09.615]  Here's another one.
[01:12:10.848 --> 01:12:14.712]  The next NSA spying shoe to drop, pre-crime artificial intelligence.
[01:12:14.752 --> 01:12:16.333]  That's up on FLWars.com.
[01:12:16.834 --> 01:12:19.597]  Yeah, where they say you're guilty when you're not really guilty.
[01:12:21.238 --> 01:12:25.342]  They can also then not just predict the future with these systems, they can then program the future.
[01:12:26.343 --> 01:12:31.228]  Documents uncovered by Snowden show British eavesdropping by GCHQ.
[01:12:32.309 --> 01:12:35.332]  Again, repeatedly hacking in diplomats' phones, emails report.
[01:12:37.150 --> 01:12:40.893]  G20 Summit, NSA targeted Russian President Medvedev in London.
[01:12:41.213 --> 01:12:59.468]  Folks, when I was inside a Bilderberg meeting, after they'd already closed it down in 2008, every major room, conference room, was jammed full of spy equipment, with people openly going, I got a Navy satellite, I got an Air Force satellite, it's a GM7Q overlay, I told you!
[01:12:59.688 --> 01:13:04.953]  And there was like, people talking in French and German and Israeli, and each room was allowed to spy on the other.
[01:13:06.212 --> 01:13:08.434]  I mean, it's an incredibly important summit.
[01:13:10.976 --> 01:13:16.461]  Continuing, Dick Cheney suggestions Snowden, a Chinese spy, is sheer nonsense, say the Chinese.
[01:13:16.802 --> 01:13:19.924]  I mean, if anybody's a Chinese spy, it's Cheney and the Globalist.
[01:13:20.425 --> 01:13:23.167]  Edward Snowden, again, is not a Chinese spy, says Beijing.
[01:13:25.369 --> 01:13:28.772]  Cheney calls Snowden a traitor, says Rand Paul, wrong about surveillance.
[01:13:28.812 --> 01:13:30.394]  So it's all for our safety, right, Cheney?
[01:13:33.021 --> 01:13:38.246]  And it goes on and on and on and on.
[01:13:40.147 --> 01:13:44.651]  And then you've got CIA whistleblower in prison for reporting on waterboarding.
[01:13:46.192 --> 01:13:47.534]  This is the type of garbage
[01:13:48.700 --> 01:13:49.281]  That's happening.
[01:13:49.321 --> 01:13:55.747]  I'm going to go to our guest and get into the economic news and the latest on all the NSA spying.
[01:13:55.807 --> 01:13:57.709]  But China is teetering on the brink.
[01:13:58.129 --> 01:13:59.251]  Have a stack of news.
[01:14:00.131 --> 01:14:04.636]  Finch says China credit bubble unprecedented in modern world history.
[01:14:04.816 --> 01:14:10.302]  All of these credit bubbles are the same corporate interest accelerating
[01:14:11.508 --> 01:14:20.933]  money printing bubbles and fiat bubbles to take over the world and then sign us on to their debt and then pose as the saviors during the global reorganization.
[01:14:22.394 --> 01:14:34.801]  And so I agree with Kaiser that we're already in a world meltdown with him lying and saying the economy's gotten great, with the globalists picking winners and losers, but I believe from their own statements it is an engineered collapse.
[01:14:35.121 --> 01:14:36.862]  Now the question is will they ride this out?
[01:14:37.243 --> 01:14:39.204]  But he said a year ago, it would happen in April,
[01:14:40.222 --> 01:14:41.403]  And it didn't happen in April.
[01:14:41.423 --> 01:14:42.244]  He said late April.
[01:14:43.125 --> 01:14:44.186]  But it was a bold prediction.
[01:14:44.246 --> 01:14:46.809]  Now much of what he predicted is starting to happen.
[01:14:47.089 --> 01:14:53.156]  I wouldn't say he's been proven correct yet, but I was watching CNBC this morning and they were all the pundits.
[01:14:54.217 --> 01:14:59.203]  Now they may zig when they zag, so it may be the opposite, but they were saying, yeah, it looks like the Fed's going to start tapering.
[01:14:59.543 --> 01:15:00.884]  Yeah, things are going to implode.
[01:15:01.005 --> 01:15:01.765]  Outlook's bad.
[01:15:04.048 --> 01:15:04.569]  What does that mean?
[01:15:04.589 --> 01:15:08.013]  It means they'll start a war as a political distraction, which you now see happening.
[01:15:08.033 --> 01:15:17.243]  So I see a lot of indicators there that the big collapse could be beginning to arrive.
[01:15:17.303 --> 01:15:18.464]  Now I hope that's not the case.
[01:15:19.245 --> 01:15:29.908]  But joining us is Max Keiser, who of course invented the Hollywood Stock Exchange, which is the basis of a lot of the virtual trading used today, and was a very successful stockbroker before, I guess, retiring at like age 40.
[01:15:30.749 --> 01:15:32.029]  And he joins us now.
[01:15:32.049 --> 01:15:38.391]  He writes for a lot of major publications, MaxKeiser.com, and has a show on RT as well, and has had shows on BBC.
[01:15:38.671 --> 01:15:40.572]  Max, you heard me kind of set the table there.
[01:15:40.832 --> 01:15:42.192]  Thank you for joining us from London.
[01:15:42.952 --> 01:15:48.434]  What do you make of my take on this, and what is happening right now?
[01:15:50.951 --> 01:15:54.956]  It all turns on interest rates.
[01:15:56.097 --> 01:15:59.181]  And interest rates are starting to move up now.
[01:16:00.122 --> 01:16:05.227]  This is pretty much going to put the kibosh on global bond markets and stock markets.
[01:16:06.145 --> 01:16:20.316]  And the rhetoric coming out of the mainstream financial press, as of a couple of months ago, was that rising interest rates were telegraphing increased growth, that there was an increased growth in the economy.
[01:16:20.376 --> 01:16:27.021]  But since then, all the major economies have reported their GDPs are down, employment is flat, it's stagnating.
[01:16:27.381 --> 01:16:30.504]  So the reason interest rates are going up is not because of growth, but because of fear
[01:16:32.181 --> 01:16:37.203]  Fear that this unwinding of this epic bubble is happening.
[01:16:37.863 --> 01:16:40.224]  And so, this is what I said would happen.
[01:16:40.944 --> 01:16:44.905]  And the rising interest rates are telling us that that is exactly what is happening.
[01:16:44.985 --> 01:16:47.386]  So, look for interest rates to continue to go higher.
[01:16:47.426 --> 01:16:59.410]  This means that anyone with mortgages, variable rate mortgages, particularly in the UK, what they call the mortgages that are set, variable rate mortgages, tracker mortgages,
[01:17:00.390 --> 01:17:03.893]  We'll be underwater very quickly on any houses that they bought.
[01:17:04.653 --> 01:17:17.761]  And of course, George Osborne, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, has been fueling a massive Ponzi scheme here in the UK by having the government guarantee mortgages up to 20% of a mortgage under a scheme called Help to Buy.
[01:17:18.661 --> 01:17:24.965]  He's actually mirroring the catastrophe that was Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that led to the collapse of housing in America.
[01:17:24.985 --> 01:17:27.307]  So, George Osborne is doing that now.
[01:17:27.367 --> 01:17:29.028]  He's just started that program here.
[01:17:29.668 --> 01:17:32.649]  So this of course will also end in disaster.
[01:17:34.710 --> 01:17:54.816]  Now for laymen out there, describe the economic situation we're in, why this is happening, and any other tricks they may have up their sleeve to extend the incremental collapse out that they want to properly milk us and then draw and quarter us, rather than a big accelerated collapse
[01:17:55.516 --> 01:18:01.582]  Uh, which they fear, in their own words, uh, might... I mean, I saw Jim Cramer this morning saying, stop the derivatives!
[01:18:01.982 --> 01:18:03.744]  You're coming out with synthetic derivatives!
[01:18:04.064 --> 01:18:05.505]  The people aren't gonna put up with it!
[01:18:05.605 --> 01:18:06.106]  Stop it!
[01:18:06.586 --> 01:18:09.008]  Uh, you know, you guys are gonna get us all in trouble!
[01:18:09.589 --> 01:18:20.459]  Uh, but it doesn't matter, because the more aggressive criminals, and Cramer admits that he's an insider trading criminal, NVIDIA's, the more aggressive criminals, the suicide traders, as you call them, they're in control.
[01:18:22.170 --> 01:18:34.656]  Yeah, well, to give the context of this, over the past 30 to 40 years, it's been a race between those who are creating debt and the growth that we see in the economy.
[01:18:34.676 --> 01:18:39.838]  And sometimes there is a positive GDP growth, despite the increase in debt.
[01:18:40.718 --> 01:18:45.880]  Sometimes debt is growing faster than GDP, and we call those periods recessions.
[01:18:46.341 --> 01:18:49.502]  And when growth is outstripping debt, we call those periods of growth.
[01:18:49.542 --> 01:18:50.362]  But starting in 2008,
[01:18:52.287 --> 01:19:01.592]  The world now is in five years of debt increasing without any growth, barely appreciable growth anywhere in the world, and it was even just six months ago.
[01:19:01.632 --> 01:19:06.535]  China was considered to be growing, now it's considered to be contracting, or its growth rate de-accelerating.
[01:19:07.398 --> 01:19:10.479]  So, there's no growth to get people out of this debt.
[01:19:10.519 --> 01:19:18.380]  The derivatives pile, the synthetic derivatives pile, the massive pile that Kramer's talking about, is growing.
[01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:21.781]  Now, is there another trick up the sleeve of the global banksters?
[01:19:22.381 --> 01:19:30.303]  There is another trick that they could do, which is that they could take up to $100 trillion worth of bad debt, combine them in Europe, the U.S.,
[01:19:30.923 --> 01:19:43.268]  And Asia into a new bond that they could create based on the IMF monetizing this paper via their special drawing right, or SDR.
[01:19:43.668 --> 01:19:48.189]  You know, the IMF is like a central bank in that respect, like the ECB or the Federal Reserve.
[01:19:48.810 --> 01:19:51.951]  It has its own currency, the special drawing right, or the SDR.
[01:19:52.991 --> 01:20:00.940]  And two or three years ago at Davos, one of the people attending Davos mentioned that they could float a 100 trillion dollar
[01:20:03.249 --> 01:20:09.510]  And then back it with carbon taxes.
[01:20:09.790 --> 01:20:10.271]  Stay there.
[01:20:10.311 --> 01:20:13.591]  We'll be right back with the 100 trillion global government tax.
[01:20:13.611 --> 01:20:14.431]  You need it the most.
[01:20:14.531 --> 01:20:17.312]  Will your generator, power equipment or vehicle be ready?
[01:20:17.452 --> 01:20:19.872]  Gas and diesel fuels go bad quickly when stored.
[01:20:20.012 --> 01:20:24.653]  And more than half of generator failures during disasters occur as a result of expired fuel.
[01:20:24.813 --> 01:20:28.694]  PRI fuel stabilizers keep your fuel fresh for when you need it most.
[01:20:28.894 --> 01:20:34.779]  Nuclear power stations, emergency service providers, and ships at sea rely on PRI fuel stabilizers.
[01:20:34.939 --> 01:20:35.900]  And you can too!
[01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:42.505]  Call 888-776-9373 or visit PRIProducts.com to find the dealer nearest you.
[01:20:42.885 --> 01:20:52.073]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[01:20:52.133 --> 01:20:58.999]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:20:59.159 --> 01:20:59.980]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[01:21:00.020 --> 01:21:03.103]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[01:21:03.243 --> 01:21:04.064]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[01:21:04.084 --> 01:21:05.405]  It's time to understand the system.
[01:21:05.445 --> 01:21:05.725]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:05.765 --> 01:21:06.046]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:21:13.422 --> 01:21:18.846]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:21:20.066 --> 01:21:24.830]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:21:25.210 --> 01:21:31.994]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.

[01:24:23.523 --> 01:24:25.184]  Again, if you just tuned in, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:24:25.244 --> 01:24:25.764]  I'm your host.
[01:24:25.825 --> 01:24:27.666]  I'm a libertarian constitutionalist.
[01:24:28.763 --> 01:24:30.204]  I'm a constitutionalist populist.
[01:24:30.264 --> 01:24:31.185]  I just want justice.
[01:24:31.825 --> 01:24:32.506]  I want freedom.
[01:24:33.947 --> 01:24:38.291]  And so I'm demonized by basically every publication in the United States.
[01:24:38.991 --> 01:24:47.938]  Every establishment publication from National Review to MSNBC, from Bill O'Reilly to CNN.
[01:24:49.359 --> 01:24:56.005]  And I just have a sick feeling that I've never had before about America and just about the world.
[01:24:57.972 --> 01:25:05.436]  I'm very, very, very, very, very upset because I don't get up here and talk about world economic collapses to have a shocking headline.
[01:25:06.317 --> 01:25:10.079]  I know when they get up there on all the financial shows and say, it's the best economy ever!
[01:25:10.139 --> 01:25:10.959]  Everything's wonderful!
[01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:13.001]  I know what's happening in the real economy.
[01:25:13.301 --> 01:25:15.782]  I know about municipalities going bankrupt all over the U.S.
[01:25:15.822 --> 01:25:16.443]  and all over the world.
[01:25:16.963 --> 01:25:22.126]  I know about Europe being signed on to derivative debts that aren't their debts in any case
[01:25:24.201 --> 01:25:27.342]  Trillions and trillions of dollars designed to bankrupt us.
[01:25:28.183 --> 01:25:30.624]  I see governments gearing up for oppression.
[01:25:32.325 --> 01:25:37.947]  I see just brazen criminal activity by the government and corporations, and it freaks me out.
[01:25:39.188 --> 01:25:41.509]  And so I look for places to move, places to run.
[01:25:41.569 --> 01:25:42.289]  There is nowhere.
[01:25:42.789 --> 01:25:44.350]  It's a global corporate government.
[01:25:45.763 --> 01:25:54.607]  And I've seen them go from on MSNBC and CNN from saying the economy is wonderful to oh my gosh we're in trouble.
[01:25:56.727 --> 01:26:03.930]  Which means that they may be getting ready to drop the hammer because they want to at least act like with short attention spans of the public that they knew what they were talking about.
[01:26:04.230 --> 01:26:11.113]  They know the truth and they could have fixed this is what's sad about it but they cannot turn back
[01:26:12.472 --> 01:26:16.395]  from this gulag casino model that Max Keiser talks about.
[01:26:16.636 --> 01:26:21.740]  This is a short segment, long segment coming up, Max, but are you dreading this as much as I am?
[01:26:21.780 --> 01:26:24.442]  I mean, how are you handling this emotionally?
[01:26:24.862 --> 01:26:29.346]  And at your gut level, I mean, how bad is it?
[01:26:29.386 --> 01:26:30.988]  What do you really think is going to happen, Max?
[01:26:33.383 --> 01:26:34.044]  Well, yay!
[01:26:34.144 --> 01:26:37.485]  First of all, we miss you here in the UK.
[01:26:37.646 --> 01:26:41.788]  When you were here, the media and the TV shows were interesting for a few days.
[01:26:41.888 --> 01:26:47.491]  Now it's back to the same old boring BBC and same old nonsense.
[01:26:47.851 --> 01:26:48.592]  When are you coming back?
[01:26:49.712 --> 01:26:51.393]  Well, Max, I don't know.
[01:26:51.413 --> 01:26:56.036]  I don't know if I can run the gauntlet there and back here in the US.
[01:26:56.056 --> 01:27:01.099]  The point I'm getting at here is, how bad is it currently right now?
[01:27:03.038 --> 01:27:09.579]  Well, it's a slow-motion train wreck that is brought about by too much debt.
[01:27:09.659 --> 01:27:14.961]  I mean, I guess you could imagine that you've got this train, and it's pulling debt.
[01:27:15.001 --> 01:27:17.601]  The American economy is the engine, and it's pulling debt.
[01:27:18.461 --> 01:27:22.382]  And the government is adding more cars of debt to this train.
[01:27:22.462 --> 01:27:26.883]  And it's slowing down, it's slowing down, and it's coming to a complete stop.
[01:27:26.963 --> 01:27:29.304]  And then people are panicking all over the world.
[01:27:30.364 --> 01:27:31.685]  Look what's happening in Chicago.
[01:27:31.725 --> 01:27:33.045]  Look at all the violence.
[01:27:33.065 --> 01:27:35.106]  Look what's happening in Detroit.
[01:27:35.667 --> 01:27:38.068]  The state is about to go bankrupt.
[01:27:38.108 --> 01:27:40.409]  That's a direct result of this problem.
[01:27:40.569 --> 01:27:45.951]  It's just happening in a regional basis, but that's a direct result of what exactly we're talking about.
[01:27:45.991 --> 01:27:47.072]  They say, when's it going to happen?
[01:27:47.092 --> 01:27:48.252]  When's the collapse going to happen?
[01:27:48.272 --> 01:27:50.553]  Well, in Detroit, it's happened already.
[01:27:50.893 --> 01:27:55.556]  In Chicago, it's become more violent than Iraq.
[01:27:55.636 --> 01:27:56.936]  I mean, this is already happening.
[01:27:56.976 --> 01:27:58.077]  So it's happening right now.
[01:27:58.937 --> 01:28:09.646]  It hasn't happened from coast to coast as such, but it's happening in these pockets that are exploding in the United States and in cities all over the world, because it's all connected to the same problem.
[01:28:10.607 --> 01:28:16.052]  And it'll happen here in the UK, of course, more obviously in the short term.
[01:28:16.403 --> 01:28:29.786]  And that's what the martial law build-up is mainly for, is just the clamp-down and taking everybody's private bank accounts and the Boy Scouts serving in FEMA brigades.
[01:28:29.846 --> 01:28:33.027]  I mean, it's just... Well, we had an example of it here in the UK this week.
[01:28:33.047 --> 01:28:34.767]  There's a bank called Co-Op Bank.
[01:28:35.047 --> 01:28:37.048]  It wasn't big enough to be too big to fail.
[01:28:37.728 --> 01:28:39.548]  So instead, they're going to do a bail-in.
[01:28:39.628 --> 01:28:42.849]  So the bondholders of the bank are going to have to pony up some cash.
[01:28:43.658 --> 01:28:45.799]  So this is another trend we've seen in the last couple of years.
[01:28:45.879 --> 01:28:50.701]  If you're part of the too-big-to-fail bank, then the government bails out the bondholders and you're sweet.
[01:28:51.301 --> 01:29:01.244]  If you're not part of that club, then it could be in Cyprus, it could be part of a co-op bank, it could be part of some other bank or country, and therefore you get your wealth confiscated.
[01:29:01.404 --> 01:29:05.166]  So wealth confiscation is a trend that became very obvious with Cyprus.
[01:29:05.846 --> 01:29:09.407]  And now it's getting growing in different regions.
[01:29:10.127 --> 01:29:11.348]  They're talking about it in Japan.
[01:29:11.408 --> 01:29:20.410]  Remember 10 months ago or 11 months ago when I said that there's this global bond apocalypse on the horizon, I said the number one trigger for this would be Japan.
[01:29:20.991 --> 01:29:25.112]  And since that time we have had a huge economic
[01:29:25.772 --> 01:29:27.033]  We're good to go.
[01:29:43.782 --> 01:29:56.010]  Yeah, you did say a year ago it would start in Japan, and much of what you predicted is now starting to happen.
[01:29:56.030 --> 01:30:01.154]  I'm going to talk about short-term, mid-term, long-term, what you think is going to happen next, gold, and a lot more.
[01:30:02.474 --> 01:30:03.355]  We're on the march.
[01:30:03.855 --> 01:30:05.476]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:06.397 --> 01:30:09.079]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:13.075 --> 01:30:14.716]  Introducing Pro-1.
[01:30:14.976 --> 01:30:18.478]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[01:30:18.618 --> 01:30:23.021]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[01:30:23.181 --> 01:30:29.145]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[01:30:29.265 --> 01:30:40.051]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.
[01:30:40.251 --> 01:30:46.558]  It is the only one that does it, and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[01:30:46.758 --> 01:31:01.493]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands,
[01:31:09.035 --> 01:31:15.776]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[01:31:16.056 --> 01:31:20.877]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:31:21.057 --> 01:31:28.239]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[01:31:28.379 --> 01:31:33.781]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[01:31:34.001 --> 01:31:37.742]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[01:31:38.022 --> 01:31:42.564]  You've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[01:31:42.744 --> 01:31:47.966]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[01:31:48.226 --> 01:31:51.289]  Strategic Relocation 3rd Edition by Joel Skousen.
[01:31:51.449 --> 01:31:53.691]  When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.
[01:31:53.951 --> 01:31:58.535]  Therosafe used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[01:31:58.735 --> 01:32:01.177]  Hand Crank Shortwave AM FM Radios.

[01:33:14.318 --> 01:33:18.340]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:33:19.121 --> 01:33:20.582]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:33:20.842 --> 01:33:22.022]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:22.503 --> 01:33:27.626]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:27.686 --> 01:33:29.066]  Revolution calling!
[01:33:29.127 --> 01:33:31.908]  Revolution calling!
[01:33:41.078 --> 01:33:48.423]  What we're seeing is a revolution by technocrats using NSA systems to rig the markets, to spy on their competition.
[01:33:48.443 --> 01:33:59.590]  So, how do we have a revolution against criminal revolutionaries that got control in 1913 of the issuance of our currency and have now gotten control of most of our society?
[01:33:59.650 --> 01:34:02.192]  They've been dumbing us down for a long time.
[01:34:02.312 --> 01:34:08.576]  What do you do when they publicly run Al-Qaeda and are giving them missiles and Saudi Arabia says give them more missiles?
[01:34:10.353 --> 01:34:14.316]  Which is just the cover to claim they gave him the missiles they really got from Benghazi.
[01:34:15.777 --> 01:34:19.600]  And... I see articles like this all the time here in the U.S.
[01:34:19.660 --> 01:34:19.880]  now.
[01:34:20.701 --> 01:34:23.243]  Here's one out of WHAM television.
[01:34:24.244 --> 01:34:28.027]  Man charged after corralling suspected vandals in a closet.
[01:34:28.507 --> 01:34:31.109]  He came in where they'd done $40,000 worth of damage.
[01:34:31.129 --> 01:34:32.110]  They've been indicted for that.
[01:34:32.510 --> 01:34:34.211]  With a hammer knocking holes in the wall.
[01:34:34.652 --> 01:34:36.993]  He grabbed the hammer away and said, wait here for police.
[01:34:37.494 --> 01:34:38.875]  And he's now been indicted.
[01:34:41.089 --> 01:34:42.849]  He's now been charged.
[01:34:45.730 --> 01:34:46.670]  So that's how.
[01:34:46.690 --> 01:34:55.872]  A Wayne County man is now facing charges, four charges of endangering the welfare of a child after he interrupted an act of vandalism.
[01:34:55.932 --> 01:34:58.353]  See, he didn't even touch any of them.
[01:34:59.753 --> 01:35:02.174]  But you don't have a right to citizen's arrest now.
[01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:16.404]  In England, again, if you fight back with your fist with someone trying to stab you in your home, they will, even if you get stabbed and you beat them up, they will indict you, throw you in prison, because there's nothing more evil than a citizen defending themselves.
[01:35:17.225 --> 01:35:20.946]  That's the great crime to a criminal government.
[01:35:22.466 --> 01:35:23.307]  To a nanny state.
[01:35:25.407 --> 01:35:26.668]  I want to get this guy on the show.
[01:35:28.493 --> 01:35:35.015]  And then I've got all this other NSA news about how they retina scan kids all over the country when they get on the school bus and don't tell the parents.
[01:35:35.375 --> 01:35:37.135]  Same thing was done in England a few years ago.
[01:35:37.495 --> 01:35:43.097]  It's a global unified program of just the good fellows that are a bunch of corporate crooks taking over.
[01:35:43.457 --> 01:35:44.977]  So Max, let me ask you this question.
[01:35:45.417 --> 01:35:46.697]  Break it down in layman terms.
[01:35:47.178 --> 01:35:49.098]  What do you expect to see now in the economy?
[01:35:49.658 --> 01:35:50.738]  How bad will it get?
[01:35:53.499 --> 01:35:54.860]  What other rabbits can they pull?
[01:35:54.900 --> 01:35:56.121]  You mentioned some of those.
[01:35:56.562 --> 01:35:57.623]  What will that do?
[01:35:58.864 --> 01:36:03.568]  And how do you, looking out into the future, how do you expect this in your gut to end?
[01:36:03.848 --> 01:36:05.790]  What does Max Keiser think is really going to happen?
[01:36:07.051 --> 01:36:13.356]  Well, the two important numbers are inflation and the rate at which wages are growing.
[01:36:14.377 --> 01:36:16.999]  We know wages are flat to contracting.
[01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:21.003]  Adjusted for inflation, real wages haven't grown in 10 years.
[01:36:22.208 --> 01:36:23.949]  But inflation is growing.
[01:36:24.209 --> 01:36:26.970]  So the government says it's running at 2.5% to 3% here in the U.S.
[01:36:27.090 --> 01:36:28.471]  or the U.K.
[01:36:29.431 --> 01:36:35.293]  But if you look at the price of what stuff we really buy, gasoline, food, etc., it's running at 8, 9, 9%.
[01:36:38.194 --> 01:36:41.776]  So that trend is where people make direct contact with
[01:36:42.655 --> 01:36:44.836]  How these policies are hurting them.
[01:36:46.077 --> 01:36:48.257]  Their dollars are losing purchasing power.
[01:36:50.118 --> 01:36:52.159]  Their standard of living is decreasing.
[01:36:52.599 --> 01:36:54.900]  And they don't have any wage growth to offset that.
[01:36:55.680 --> 01:36:57.561]  And that trend will continue.
[01:36:58.402 --> 01:37:05.384]  Over the past 50 years or so, there was a bit of a correlation between stock prices and wages.
[01:37:05.404 --> 01:37:08.986]  A lot of times you would see stock prices go up and wages would go up.
[01:37:09.696 --> 01:37:19.145]  But this past five years, during this stock market rally that has made many billionaires many, many times richer, wages have stayed flat.
[01:37:19.846 --> 01:37:29.515]  So the financial engineers have perfected a technique where they can increase asset values, that is to say stocks and stuff like art, fine art.
[01:37:30.257 --> 01:37:32.939]  Yachts, et cetera, things that the billionaires buy.
[01:37:32.999 --> 01:37:38.343]  They figured out a way to get those prices to keep going higher without increasing wages.
[01:37:38.963 --> 01:37:42.265]  So that's been the experiment that's been on for 30 years.
[01:37:42.305 --> 01:37:43.546]  They finally have perfected this.
[01:37:44.286 --> 01:37:53.693]  So there's no reason to stop because the cost of labor is not going to go higher, no matter how much money they print to put in their own pocket.
[01:37:54.551 --> 01:37:55.913]  Wages are just not going to go higher.
[01:37:56.433 --> 01:37:59.857]  Exactly, it's an inflation only in luxury goods.
[01:38:01.759 --> 01:38:09.887]  Everything else is imploding, and then they'll just... People only have jobs as cops or prison guards, and so we go into the gulag economy.
[01:38:09.907 --> 01:38:13.671]  It's all been... Well, Rand Corporation, as you know, wrote about it 50 years ago.
[01:38:13.711 --> 01:38:14.913]  They've really done a great job.
[01:38:15.711 --> 01:38:23.436]  Yeah, there's no way that wages are ever going to match inflation in the foreseeable future.
[01:38:24.816 --> 01:38:32.081]  And of course, the unions which were in place to defend the worker, they've been completely destroyed.
[01:38:32.261 --> 01:38:36.243]  Now, of course, you can say, well, unions are run by corrupt union officials.
[01:38:36.283 --> 01:38:37.004]  That's true.
[01:38:37.884 --> 01:38:40.246]  Union officials have done a lot to destroy the unions.
[01:38:40.846 --> 01:38:47.548]  But, nevertheless, now you have a situation where there's absolutely no one lobbying on behalf of workers at all.
[01:38:47.588 --> 01:38:50.229]  There's nobody lobbying for workers for wages.
[01:38:50.889 --> 01:39:10.155]  I've said, and this is true economically, that if you simply paid out wages to workers and you tripled or quadrupled the minimum wage and financed it with the same 0% interest rates from the Federal Reserve that Citibank can get or Lloyd's in London can get,
[01:39:11.041 --> 01:39:11.221]  Sure.
[01:39:11.241 --> 01:39:12.042]  Sure, what's the plan?
[01:39:24.534 --> 01:39:26.755]  What's the plan to bring in 30 million illegals?
[01:39:26.795 --> 01:39:30.097]  I mean, the globalists are all for it, Republicans and Democrats.
[01:39:30.617 --> 01:39:34.419]  I just look at it and say, I can't go to Mexico and have a baby for free.
[01:39:34.519 --> 01:39:35.779]  I can't get on welfare there.
[01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:39.281]  I'm all for workers to this country, and I'm all for immigrants.
[01:39:39.781 --> 01:39:48.986]  My issue is, is that they are now basically corporate minions and are going to be used to drive down wages even further, and that that's the goal.
[01:39:50.299 --> 01:39:51.039]  Right, cheap labor.
[01:39:51.459 --> 01:39:52.420]  Of course that's the goal.
[01:39:52.900 --> 01:39:54.461]  Cheap labor is desirable.
[01:39:55.181 --> 01:40:04.085]  And as long as these people have no rights, as long as they are one step out of prison, or even the biggest working population in America right now are actually prisoners.
[01:40:04.485 --> 01:40:10.968]  Because there was an overturn of a law recently that made it legal, once again, to outsource labor to prison.
[01:40:11.648 --> 01:40:25.255]  And not only are judges throwing kids into prison on spurious claims to feed the prison-industrial complex, but now they're putting people in prison because that's now become a cheap source of labor.
[01:40:25.395 --> 01:40:31.078]  Now, this is a complete repudiation of laws against slave labor, so slavery is legal in America.
[01:40:31.118 --> 01:40:34.620]  Anyone who thinks that slavery was outlawed is wrong.
[01:40:34.680 --> 01:40:36.641]  Slavery is completely legal in America.
[01:40:37.918 --> 01:40:38.918]  I totally agree.
[01:40:39.058 --> 01:40:47.582]  In fact, when you see them passing a law where even many wooden pipes, it says some wooden pipes are okay, but if you read the definition of hookahs and things, it's not.
[01:40:48.142 --> 01:41:06.730]  We're a felony to have a pipe, and then you see stuff where they tell the kid, take your NRA shirt off, but the school didn't have a code against, you know, non-profane lettering, so they charge him with the gun on his shirt being a terroristic threat, and then they tell kids at commencements that they can't
[01:41:07.830 --> 01:41:12.053]  Thank God, when that's their free speech, whether you believe in God or not.
[01:41:12.413 --> 01:41:28.281]  I mean, I just see cases every day of how wildly authoritarian things are, and how the law is designed to let violent offenders go, but keep the non-violent people actually in the prisons working for 25 cents an hour.
[01:41:28.642 --> 01:41:34.285]  That's how they legalize slavery, is they just pass a bunch of laws now where 0.5, that's half a beer,
[01:41:37.767 --> 01:41:47.296]  The country with the biggest prison population in the world is the United States.
[01:41:47.356 --> 01:41:52.962]  Bigger than China, bigger than any country in the world is the United States because it's such a hugely profitable country.
[01:41:53.692 --> 01:41:54.493]  Profitable business.
[01:41:54.873 --> 01:41:59.216]  And the thing about the Second Amendment or gun rights is that it's a hot button issue.
[01:41:59.276 --> 01:42:06.740]  So a lot of people will be out there defending their Second Amendment rights, but sacrifice their first, third, fourth, fifth, sixth Amendment rights.
[01:42:07.321 --> 01:42:09.242]  So it's very unbalanced.
[01:42:11.083 --> 01:42:18.148]  The pro-gun debate is unbalanced in that people are willing to defend their Second Amendment right, but sacrifice their First Amendment, right?
[01:42:18.168 --> 01:42:19.549]  Or their Third or Fourth Amendment, right?
[01:42:19.589 --> 01:42:28.095]  So there's a bit of a confusion, I think, in the overall pushback against this NSA, PRISM-style Gulag state.
[01:42:28.135 --> 01:42:34.560]  Remember, the prison Gulag state needs a PRISM to make it work, and now we know, thanks to Edward Snowden, that there is.
[01:42:35.460 --> 01:42:58.838]  You know, you should change the name of Prison Planet to Prison Planet, because now we all live in this NSA prism, a dome of perpetual surveillance, and I thought the interview with Edward Snowden today was pretty interesting in that he touched on a lot of very interesting points, and I am in the camp that gives him 100% credibility, along with Glenn Greenwald.
[01:42:59.518 --> 01:43:08.132]  So, there is at least a few people out there who have managed to blow the whistle, come forward, and give the administration some hot flashes.
[01:43:08.893 --> 01:43:12.238]  Well, I love how over and over again
[01:43:13.945 --> 01:43:17.546]  We see Cheney and Neocons come out and say, arrest this guy.
[01:43:18.006 --> 01:43:19.947]  He's a traitor, he must work for the Chinese.
[01:43:20.307 --> 01:43:34.892]  These are the guys that transferred our missile secrets, our reactor secrets, our technology, our jobs, bipartisanly, the Democrats are involved as well, to Communist China because they could get fat cat state guaranteed deals with them.
[01:43:34.952 --> 01:43:36.113]  Now they're busy selling off
[01:43:36.673 --> 01:43:44.715]  I was watching this morning CNBC, like I said, and they were just, even the hosts were like, my God, they're buying up the entire infrastructure because America sold out.
[01:43:45.215 --> 01:43:50.696]  MIT has come out and admitted that the jobs are never coming back because we sold out the infrastructure.
[01:43:51.056 --> 01:43:53.417]  The elite here will no longer be the elite.
[01:43:53.757 --> 01:43:58.378]  They were so greedy, they even destroyed their own command base, Max Keiser.
[01:43:58.418 --> 01:44:02.919]  And so my point is, it's so rich how this military-industrial complex
[01:44:03.539 --> 01:44:12.926]  Talks about how it's taking our rights to protect us, when everybody knows they run Al-Qaeda, they run the Chi-Coms, everything bad, they run it.
[01:44:14.147 --> 01:44:24.595]  Well, you make a good point there, that the Chinese of the world are pointing to foreign powers and saying we need to protect ourselves against them invading.
[01:44:25.015 --> 01:44:31.500]  While at the same time, he's cutting deals with the exact same foreign powers to buy huge pieces of America's infrastructure.
[01:44:32.400 --> 01:44:40.444]  China, in particular, is buying up big pieces of American industry, as are other countries around the world.
[01:44:40.564 --> 01:44:50.989]  And the reason why they're cutting deals now is because of the huge debt that America has, that they realize that the only way they can settle this debt is to sell off these big pieces of the infrastructure.
[01:44:51.429 --> 01:44:52.830]  And you see, you saw this in
[01:44:53.610 --> 01:44:54.130]  In Greece.
[01:44:54.330 --> 01:45:04.015]  Greece was a country that before Goldman Sachs and, I'm sorry, John Paulson and Papandreou, the Prime Minister got involved, it was a $400 billion economy.
[01:45:04.715 --> 01:45:07.977]  It was determined that it wasn't that big of an economy.
[01:45:08.017 --> 01:45:13.039]  It was, after all, maybe only two times the size of IBM or two times the size of Berkshire Hathaway.
[01:45:13.399 --> 01:45:17.421]  And you could effectively do a leveraged buyout of Greece, and that's exactly what they did.
[01:45:17.761 --> 01:45:20.002]  They went in there, they flooded it with lots of bad debt.
[01:45:20.562 --> 01:45:22.383]  They transferred that debt to the government.
[01:45:22.423 --> 01:45:25.865]  The government then transferred that debt to the people through austerity.
[01:45:26.325 --> 01:45:27.966]  The economy has collapsed.
[01:45:28.306 --> 01:45:29.827]  And now they're selling off the assets.
[01:45:29.907 --> 01:45:39.051]  A few weeks ago, for the first time, one of the Greek islands was sold to a cutter, one of the top guys in cutter, the emir of cutter.
[01:45:39.452 --> 01:45:44.154]  And that opened the floodgates for these kleptocrats and oligarchs to start buying these Greek islands.
[01:45:44.614 --> 01:45:52.905]  Just like Detroit created taxes that ran everybody out, set up this corrupt bureaucracy, and now they're fully collapsing.
[01:45:53.365 --> 01:45:57.230]  That is the model, but I think this is so out of control they may not get away with it.
[01:45:57.491 --> 01:46:00.194]  Let me show TV viewers and radio listeners a couple articles here.
[01:46:00.855 --> 01:46:01.736]  The New York Times.
[01:46:02.637 --> 01:46:10.981]  Police officers arrested a protester in Istanbul on Sunday, the same day Prime Minister rallied supporters.
[01:46:11.021 --> 01:46:20.085]  So he was allowed to have people come out and rally for him, but people that just rallied to keep the only park in the city, the only green space open where they play soccer...
[01:46:20.985 --> 01:46:24.127]  It shows the police, it looks like breaking the guy's arm.
[01:46:24.427 --> 01:46:26.268]  You can see they've twisted it back so far.
[01:46:26.308 --> 01:46:27.988]  No way that didn't break.
[01:46:28.489 --> 01:46:30.089]  And stomping him in the head.
[01:46:30.590 --> 01:46:33.351]  And the New York Times goes with, police arrest.
[01:46:33.451 --> 01:46:35.912]  See, they just, everything is propaganda.
[01:46:36.132 --> 01:46:37.133]  Let's go to the next article.
[01:46:37.453 --> 01:46:39.454]  For many, no penalty for crimes.
[01:46:40.134 --> 01:46:43.916]  Drunk driving, shoplifting, breaking in homes.
[01:46:44.457 --> 01:46:49.640]  The police, it says they made the decision to not arrest for petty crimes.
[01:46:50.440 --> 01:46:53.382]  Meanwhile, the code is illegal aliens, folks.
[01:46:53.442 --> 01:46:54.783]  It's illegal aliens they don't arrest.
[01:46:55.563 --> 01:46:58.445]  And again though, citizens get pulled over with no seatbelt.
[01:46:58.785 --> 01:47:05.129]  You go to jail in Austin and they throw the book at you because we're seen as milk cows, Max Keiser.
[01:47:06.843 --> 01:47:15.546]  Yeah, well, I think it's important for people to understand that when you talk about the New York Times, you're talking about a captured journalistic enterprise.
[01:47:15.606 --> 01:47:18.987]  They are not giving you unbiased truth.
[01:47:19.967 --> 01:47:23.588]  This is an institution that's gone horribly wrong.
[01:47:24.389 --> 01:47:27.610]  So has all of the big media outlets in the U.S.
[01:47:27.690 --> 01:47:28.450]  I mean, your show
[01:47:29.350 --> 01:47:32.994]  Is delivering great information with the Texas Twister.
[01:47:33.294 --> 01:47:52.092]  You know, this is what the most people don't understand in the foreign press that in America now the media landscape is so horrid and so decrepit and so immoral that the only way you can get through the prison of lies is through this, you know, grenade approach which
[01:47:52.834 --> 01:47:59.098]  If you get past the first couple of shockwaves, you end up getting a lot and lots of really great information.
[01:47:59.158 --> 01:48:00.278]  So we want to thank you for that.
[01:48:00.339 --> 01:48:06.122]  And again, I will repeat that wherever I go in the world, people always say, oh yeah, I heard you on Alex Jones.
[01:48:06.482 --> 01:48:09.504]  Not that they heard me on the BBC or they heard me on this other outlet.
[01:48:09.524 --> 01:48:10.825]  They say, oh, I heard you on Alex Jones.
[01:48:10.865 --> 01:48:14.247]  So you've got this huge global audience with people waking up to this.
[01:48:14.707 --> 01:48:18.389]  And it's sad, though, that the country that's the most to lose is the United States.
[01:48:18.449 --> 01:48:19.450]  The people of the United States.
[01:48:20.010 --> 01:48:24.652]  They were holding all the cards, and now they've given it all back to people like Dick Cheney.
[01:48:24.992 --> 01:48:30.054]  And Dick Cheney, if there's a trader in the mix, it's not Edward Snowden, it's Dick Cheney.
[01:48:30.314 --> 01:48:38.318]  Look at Dick Cheney's track record in selling America's freedom down the rattle for what, a few extra dollars?
[01:48:38.638 --> 01:48:39.738]  What was his incentive?
[01:48:39.798 --> 01:48:40.699]  Is he that shallow?
[01:48:40.779 --> 01:48:43.660]  Is he that callous that he would just blow America?
[01:48:43.800 --> 01:48:47.244]  Well, that's even what the big Pentagon war planners say is they're getting weight.
[01:48:47.645 --> 01:48:55.754]  The military industrial complex and the banks, they have one thing, profit, but it's even destroying America's empire in the future, so they're even getting weight.
[01:48:55.794 --> 01:49:01.000]  We're going to lose the golden goose because Dick Cheney and Bill Clinton and others slaughtered it.
[01:49:01.681 --> 01:49:02.342]  It's incredible.
[01:49:02.382 --> 01:49:12.529]  We're going to go to break and come back with Max Keiser, and I'm going to find out if we can hold Max a little bit in the next hour to take your economic phone calls, and then I'll open the phones up just for general calls after Max leaves us.
[01:49:12.569 --> 01:49:18.173]  But he may have to leave in 10 minutes, so we'll see if this is the final segment when we come back with Max Keiser.
[01:49:18.193 --> 01:49:19.274]  I'll ask him during the break.
[01:49:19.314 --> 01:49:21.015]  But I just want callers to understand something.
[01:49:22.136 --> 01:49:26.199]  We have a normalcy bias in this country to basically put up with anything.
[01:49:27.720 --> 01:49:31.023]  We've gotten to where we're in a position where we'll put up with almost anything.
[01:49:32.117 --> 01:49:38.140]  And it's time for, just across the board, to stop complying and to realize we're in deep trouble.
[01:49:39.040 --> 01:49:45.743]  I mean, I fundamentally think about my children every day and try to figure out ways to fix this country so they have a future.
[01:49:47.223 --> 01:49:50.665]  And then get angry that it's a global government and that I can't leave.
[01:49:51.585 --> 01:49:52.445]  I mean, we're cornered.
[01:49:52.845 --> 01:49:53.866]  We've got to get out of here.
[01:49:55.066 --> 01:49:57.448]  The only way to beat this is to bring down the New World Order.
[01:49:57.728 --> 01:50:03.213]  They're bringing down free societies to collapse it into their controlled paradigm because they're in control.
[01:50:03.994 --> 01:50:04.734]  They can do that.
[01:50:09.255 --> 01:50:09.976]  It is madness.
[01:50:09.996 --> 01:50:11.637]  We're going to go to break and come back with Max Keiser.
[01:50:11.817 --> 01:50:14.379]  Just briefly, the trailer will be out tomorrow.
[01:50:14.979 --> 01:50:16.140]  You can pre-order it now.
[01:50:16.200 --> 01:50:18.041]  It's only available at Infowars.com.
[01:50:18.182 --> 01:50:18.562]  I'm in it.
[01:50:19.102 --> 01:50:22.164]  It's state of mind, the psychology of control.
[01:50:22.264 --> 01:50:25.867]  It's about the past, the present, and the future of mind control.
[01:50:25.967 --> 01:50:27.228]  It's very well done.
[01:50:27.849 --> 01:50:30.530]  The same makers of the people that put out
[01:50:31.994 --> 01:50:33.435]  Oklahoma City, A Noble Lie.
[01:50:33.995 --> 01:50:39.317]  The film is available in Blu-ray and DVD right now, and it's got everybody in it.
[01:50:39.337 --> 01:50:45.280]  A bunch of doctors and scientists and G. Edward Griffin and Colonel Schaefer and myself and so many others.
[01:50:45.360 --> 01:50:57.465]  So, State of Mind, The Psychology of Control, and for the first 5,000 people that ordered it, that sounds like a lot, it's not, you will get free the film exposing the private fellow reserve, The American Dream.
[01:50:57.485 --> 01:50:58.565]  I have 5,000 of these.
[01:50:58.585 --> 01:51:00.046]  When they're gone, that's it.
[01:51:00.606 --> 01:51:05.769]  We never offer a new film with something free out of the gates, but I'm doing this now because state of mind is so important.
[01:51:06.310 --> 01:51:06.910]  Order it today.
[01:51:06.930 --> 01:51:09.472]  InfowarsStore.com.

[01:52:15.336 --> 01:52:15.937]  Think again!

[01:53:12.492 --> 01:53:14.393]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[01:53:14.413 --> 01:53:16.355]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[01:53:16.575 --> 01:53:22.039]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[01:53:22.239 --> 01:53:26.002]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[01:53:26.282 --> 01:53:30.005]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[01:53:30.165 --> 01:53:31.346]  The fact is, you are.
[01:53:31.546 --> 01:53:32.327]  We all are.
[01:53:32.567 --> 01:53:34.889]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.

[01:54:42.438 --> 01:54:43.739]  Yours truly, Alex Jones.
[01:54:43.939 --> 01:54:51.184]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:54:51.204 --> 01:54:51.925]  800-259-9231.
[01:54:53.026 --> 01:54:54.887]  And we'll get you up and on the air.
[01:54:55.748 --> 01:54:59.190]  Here are some of the headlines up on InfoWars.com.
[01:54:59.630 --> 01:55:05.234]  Ron Paul is saying, Obama's Syria policy looks a lot like Bush's Iraq policy.
[01:55:06.475 --> 01:55:10.418]  Max Keiser, the collapse of the current bankster regime is upon us.
[01:55:10.458 --> 01:55:11.339]  He breaks that down.
[01:55:11.759 --> 01:55:14.581]  Journalist says TSA shamed my teenage daughter.
[01:55:15.061 --> 01:55:20.445]  Russian tycoon predicts immortality within 25 years.
[01:55:20.465 --> 01:55:23.387]  14-year-old faces year in jail over pro-gun t-shirt.
[01:55:23.807 --> 01:55:27.350]  They say the image of the rifle is a terroristic threat, a thought crime.
[01:55:27.870 --> 01:55:34.735]  The next NSA snooping shoot a drop, pre-crime, and it just goes on and on.
[01:55:35.175 --> 01:55:37.997]  Oh yeah, this just came out.
[01:55:38.017 --> 01:55:44.441]  McDonald's is now being sued by one of their workers because they cut a deal with JP Morgan where their payroll goes directly into a JP Morgan account.
[01:56:03.960 --> 01:56:09.124]  And JP Morgan then charges people $1.50 to use the ATM.
[01:56:09.524 --> 01:56:14.728]  Then they charge them $1 to just see what their balance is for a balance inquiry.
[01:56:15.368 --> 01:56:19.952]  They charge them $0.75 for online bill payment.
[01:56:19.972 --> 01:56:20.912]  $15 for a lost card.
[01:56:20.952 --> 01:56:22.734]  And they force them to use that bank.
[01:56:22.794 --> 01:56:24.215]  I mean, that is slavery.
[01:56:25.075 --> 01:56:25.936]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:56:26.036 --> 01:56:26.316]  Wow.
[01:56:26.376 --> 01:56:27.998]  That is.
[01:56:28.178 --> 01:56:32.040]  And that's what they're going to do when they get their cashless society completely in place.
[01:56:32.060 --> 01:56:32.561]  They've said it.
[01:56:33.763 --> 01:56:39.066]  Yeah, I mean, in other words, getting back to what we were saying before, wages are never going to go up.
[01:56:39.626 --> 01:56:43.468]  They can raise the minimum wage to $8 or $9 or $10, but J.P.
[01:56:43.508 --> 01:56:50.352]  Morgan will just raise their fees by $1 an hour, $2 an hour, and they'll just put that money directly into J.P.
[01:56:50.392 --> 01:56:51.072]  Morgan's pocket.
[01:56:51.112 --> 01:56:54.034]  That's what we've seen now, post-crash of 2008.
[01:56:54.414 --> 01:56:55.675]  And that was my next point.
[01:56:55.815 --> 01:56:57.696]  You said this years ago, it's now on record.
[01:56:58.596 --> 01:57:06.759]  The NSA is there to give private companies intelligence on how to game the economy, the stock market, LIBOR, all of it.
[01:57:06.979 --> 01:57:12.421]  And that came out last week, that indeed, NSA is using this data to corner markets.
[01:57:12.741 --> 01:57:14.021]  I mean, it's incredible!
[01:57:14.301 --> 01:57:17.923]  They are waging war against real economies.
[01:57:19.303 --> 01:57:22.164]  Well, there's a scandal of high-frequency trading.
[01:57:22.884 --> 01:57:28.026]  The traders who use this high-frequency trading, they're trading a billion times per second.
[01:57:28.977 --> 01:57:31.320]  On the New York Stock Exchange and other exchanges.
[01:57:31.360 --> 01:57:34.545]  They say that they're adding liquidity and they're making a market.
[01:57:34.605 --> 01:57:35.346]  Now it comes out.
[01:57:36.072 --> 01:57:46.922]  That the regulators are releasing prices at a fraction of a second before they do release to the public to give insiders insider information.
[01:57:47.683 --> 01:57:51.927]  Then that came out about the same time that the NSA Prism story broke.
[01:57:51.987 --> 01:57:57.632]  So that confirms now, and also for Congress, Congressional aides and others in Washington, insider trading is legal.
[01:57:57.652 --> 01:57:59.054]  It has not been outlawed.
[01:57:59.614 --> 01:58:12.963]  Here you have an NSA with unlimited computer power and 360-degree spy presence with a high-frequency trader on Wall Street that's totally captured by all the regulators who are trading on inside information.
[01:58:14.832 --> 01:58:17.516]  That's why the economy is the way it is.
[01:58:17.576 --> 01:58:29.633]  That's why people can't make enough to get ahead of inflation, while simultaneously, the top 5,000 people, they're billionaires, are increasing at 30 or 40% a year.
[01:58:29.653 --> 01:58:30.935]  That's how you do it.
[01:58:31.315 --> 01:58:34.377]  Stay there, Max Keiser, because here's the rest of the story.
[01:58:34.397 --> 01:58:35.898]  We're going to get your take on this when we come back.
[01:58:36.618 --> 01:58:51.887]  The globalists are then funding socialism and fake grassroots communism to then scapegoat the giant poor mass off against what's left of the middle class to usher in total social control and government engineering out of the crisis.
[01:58:53.668 --> 01:58:55.449]  You are listening to GCN.

[02:00:06.044 --> 02:00:07.965]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:08.445 --> 02:00:11.246]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.428 --> 02:00:18.068]  Big Brother.
[02:00:18.728 --> 02:00:19.788]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:20.509 --> 02:00:21.729]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:22.249 --> 02:00:23.069]  You want answers?
[02:00:23.830 --> 02:00:24.830]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:25.390 --> 02:00:29.011]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:29.572 --> 02:00:33.633]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:36.815 --> 02:00:40.437]  All right, former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura is scheduled in the next segment.
[02:00:41.618 --> 02:00:48.242]  And I'm going to get more into what it means to be in a proxy war with Russia, where the United States is allied with Al-Qaeda.
[02:00:49.223 --> 02:00:52.464]  And now they've already got their police state in place, so they go, oh, it isn't for Al-Qaeda now.
[02:00:53.145 --> 02:01:01.270]  We're going to set up checkpoints to search your vehicles, stick our hands down your pants, take DNA on the side of the road without warrants, because conservatives and Tea Party people are terrorists.
[02:01:02.349 --> 02:01:03.750]  They're like, yeah, no, you're right.
[02:01:04.730 --> 02:01:08.612]  You're right, Alex, you told them 12 years ago that they would flip it and target them, and we are.
[02:01:08.993 --> 02:01:14.576]  And by the way, we're buying thousands of armored vehicles a month, and we're building bunkers, and we're spying on you.
[02:01:16.157 --> 02:01:19.238]  And yeah, you bet the big contractors do run child kidnapping rings.
[02:01:19.418 --> 02:01:22.640]  Uh-huh, it's in the Chicago Tribune, and nobody's getting in trouble, Alex.
[02:01:24.321 --> 02:01:25.242]  I mean, it is just...
[02:01:26.374 --> 02:01:27.194]  In everyone's face.
[02:01:27.515 --> 02:01:28.615]  And we're going to get rid of the borders?
[02:01:28.935 --> 02:01:31.297]  And we're going to bring in 30 million people and give them welfare?
[02:01:31.557 --> 02:01:32.497]  And guess what, Alex?
[02:01:32.737 --> 02:01:34.418]  That's going to bankrupt things even faster.
[02:01:34.858 --> 02:01:36.119]  And then you're going to pay for it.
[02:01:36.539 --> 02:01:37.180]  How's that sound?
[02:01:38.200 --> 02:01:41.862]  And then all those people who think the government's their friend, and they're going to vote to take the guns, Alex.
[02:01:42.162 --> 02:01:43.963]  And then everybody can be slaves, just like in Mexico.
[02:01:44.243 --> 02:01:45.084]  How's that sound, Alex?
[02:01:48.706 --> 02:01:49.766]  And guess what else we're going to do, Alex?
[02:01:49.786 --> 02:01:52.928]  We're going to forcibly sterilize little girls in Mexico, Alex.
[02:01:54.089 --> 02:01:54.769]  Well, don't do that.
[02:01:57.168 --> 02:02:01.470]  See, it's racist to not want to have totally open borders in a bankrupted, collapsing society.
[02:02:02.310 --> 02:02:05.392]  But if you want to sterilize all the Mexican girls, then that's liberal.
[02:02:07.072 --> 02:02:07.813]  See how that works?
[02:02:08.553 --> 02:02:13.375]  They have got it all figured out, folks, how they sell you one thing and it's another.
[02:02:13.735 --> 02:02:14.816]  Like a cape with a bull.
[02:02:15.136 --> 02:02:15.836]  See the cape?
[02:02:15.976 --> 02:02:16.356]  Uh-huh.
[02:02:16.616 --> 02:02:17.777]  And right behind it's a sword.
[02:02:19.244 --> 02:02:22.145]  You go for the cape and get a sword run right up in the middle of you.
[02:02:22.865 --> 02:02:25.785]  And, you know, I don't want my society having a sword run up in it.
[02:02:26.305 --> 02:02:28.046]  I want to try to build a better civilization.
[02:02:31.206 --> 02:02:32.286]  Let's go back to these articles.
[02:02:32.346 --> 02:02:33.266]  So, U.S.
[02:02:34.187 --> 02:02:40.388]  agency said to swap data with thousands of firms that is used for economic espionage.
[02:02:40.428 --> 02:02:43.648]  That's used for being able to track their competition.
[02:02:43.708 --> 02:02:46.949]  It's used to steal people's inventions and data.
[02:02:48.880 --> 02:02:50.660]  Isn't that just precious?
[02:02:51.520 --> 02:02:52.441]  That's how the New World Order is.
[02:02:52.461 --> 02:02:59.542]  It's not enough to have all the free money they give themselves, the taxpayer money, with all the banker bailouts and corporate welfare and the fiat money and derivatives.
[02:02:59.842 --> 02:03:00.382]  No, no, no.
[02:03:00.442 --> 02:03:02.602]  Now they get to do all that, which they've been doing for decades.
[02:03:03.082 --> 02:03:04.303]  And then again, here's Business Insider.
[02:03:04.363 --> 02:03:06.983]  Elite traders are getting access to data before anyone else.
[02:03:07.623 --> 02:03:10.824]  The stock market's totally fake and rigged.
[02:03:11.184 --> 02:03:13.664]  Next, you're going to say Las Vegas is corrupt.
[02:03:14.584 --> 02:03:17.265]  Next, you're going to say a hooker really doesn't love you when you pay her $100.
[02:03:20.737 --> 02:03:28.867]  Next you're going to say a hooker dressed up like, like uh, you know, Meryl Monroe isn't really her with that blonde wig.
[02:03:28.907 --> 02:03:32.832]  I mean, I, I, next you're going to say the sky isn't black.
[02:03:35.655 --> 02:03:37.996]  State Department hiring agents with criminal records.
[02:03:38.036 --> 02:03:39.717]  Memo reveals how loving.
[02:03:39.817 --> 02:03:41.338]  Thousands and thousands of them.
[02:03:41.618 --> 02:03:43.739]  And they say it's an accident, but no one will be let go.
[02:03:43.759 --> 02:03:48.761]  Yeah, it's an accident they hire pedophiles to be the managers at every TSA major station that keeps coming out.
[02:03:49.422 --> 02:03:52.103]  Just defrocked priests and people and stuff like that.
[02:03:52.783 --> 02:03:53.204]  You know what?
[02:03:55.064 --> 02:03:57.206]  Normal people want to grow up little kids all day.
[02:03:57.226 --> 02:03:57.826]  Yeah, right.
[02:03:58.704 --> 02:04:01.145]  Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
[02:04:01.985 --> 02:04:04.485]  It's all about what will these people put up with.
[02:04:04.925 --> 02:04:07.626]  And the answer is, they'll put up with anything, boss.
[02:04:09.486 --> 02:04:12.567]  And I love how the TSA looks at you and goes, would you like a private screening?
[02:04:13.087 --> 02:04:17.208]  Oh yeah, I want to go behind closed doors while you grab my genitals.
[02:04:17.728 --> 02:04:21.509]  People are like, big deal, let them grab your genitals.
[02:04:22.574 --> 02:04:25.897]  Really, if you do that to somebody in a park, you go to prison for five, six, seven years.
[02:04:26.357 --> 02:04:29.179]  But it's like, we're doing it because of the Bin Laden!
[02:04:29.419 --> 02:04:29.980]  Hey!
[02:04:30.220 --> 02:04:31.501]  That's a good one, Bob!
[02:04:31.761 --> 02:04:34.103]  The Bin Laden, the CIA guy!
[02:04:34.363 --> 02:04:38.226]  And now the government runs out kind of publicly, but look at these schmoes.
[02:04:38.706 --> 02:04:45.111]  They line up and they do whatever we tell them, because Obama might blow up the plane if we don't.
[02:04:45.611 --> 02:04:46.392]  Oh, yeah!
[02:04:48.038 --> 02:04:57.722]  And you might get sick if you don't take the vaccine either, you know, cause... Sure, the government did thousands of secret tests and killed people, but we should trust them, you know?
[02:04:58.943 --> 02:05:01.604]  They brought 30,000 Nazis back to the U.S.
[02:05:01.864 --> 02:05:04.765]  to set up everything after World War II, but so what?
[02:05:05.085 --> 02:05:06.426]  Take the shots!
[02:05:06.506 --> 02:05:08.027]  Who needs to live anyway?
[02:05:08.047 --> 02:05:09.087]  Take it!
[02:05:09.107 --> 02:05:10.408]  You know it's good!

[02:06:15.757 --> 02:06:20.582]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[02:06:20.762 --> 02:06:27.929]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.

[02:08:49.190 --> 02:08:50.812]  There is so much to get into.
[02:08:50.832 --> 02:08:51.533]  Wow!
[02:08:52.754 --> 02:08:54.636]  Look at this headline out of Bloomberg.
[02:08:54.816 --> 02:08:55.157]  U.S.
[02:08:55.237 --> 02:09:07.210]  agencies said to swap data with thousands of firms and it's admitted that the Fortune 100 is using all your data to fix the stock market and to fix interest rates and to spy on their competition.
[02:09:07.691 --> 02:09:14.119]  That's what I was told by NSA whistleblowers more than 15 years ago and now it's out in the mainstream news today.
[02:09:14.139 --> 02:09:20.006]  We're going to talk to former Minnesota Governor Jesse Wintoura about all these articles for the balance of the hour coming up in just a moment.
[02:09:20.527 --> 02:09:24.692]  State Department has hired agents with criminal records, thousands of them on purpose.
[02:09:26.877 --> 02:09:30.759]  57% fear government will use NSA data to harass political opponents.
[02:09:30.879 --> 02:09:34.141]  They're already doing that to the AP and others.
[02:09:34.221 --> 02:09:36.442]  I mean, I guess 57% are informed.
[02:09:37.303 --> 02:09:50.511]  And I want to go back to a New York Times article from 2002, Total Information Awareness, where they bragged that they were already spying and sharing everything with the major corporations.
[02:09:50.531 --> 02:09:53.693]  So we're going to be breaking that down as well.
[02:09:55.987 --> 02:09:58.070]  And we're going to get Jesse Ventura's take on it.
[02:09:58.190 --> 02:10:03.056]  I mean, everything we've talked about is now coming out in the open, like this breaking news.
[02:10:03.497 --> 02:10:04.599]  Not breaking to this audience.
[02:10:04.619 --> 02:10:08.504]  We've told you for 27 months what's happening in Syria, over three years in Libya.
[02:10:08.704 --> 02:10:10.566]  Look at this headline, USA Today.
[02:10:12.208 --> 02:10:17.971]  Syrian rebels pledge loyalty to Al-Qaeda, and they go on to admit the main force is Al-Qaeda.
[02:10:18.511 --> 02:10:20.232]  They've already given them a billion bucks of U.S.
[02:10:20.272 --> 02:10:26.155]  money, and now they're going to do a no-fly zone and start bombing the country to overthrow Assad, who's done nothing to anybody.
[02:10:27.225 --> 02:10:28.246]  Al Qaeda-linked group.
[02:10:28.626 --> 02:10:31.187]  Syrian rebels once denied now key to Assad victories.
[02:10:31.487 --> 02:10:32.428]  McClatchy news.
[02:10:33.088 --> 02:10:35.970]  Arrest Obama under NDAA for supporting terrorists in Syria.
[02:10:36.270 --> 02:10:38.671]  That's what their unconstitutional law says.
[02:10:39.091 --> 02:10:40.432]  So he should have himself arrested.
[02:10:41.352 --> 02:10:43.213]  That is just some of the news.
[02:10:43.233 --> 02:10:47.776]  So we're being told WMDs again by a country that legally and lawfully has them.
[02:10:48.036 --> 02:10:50.117]  And we told you a year ago with our Syrian guest
[02:10:50.817 --> 02:11:14.319]  uh... on the show that they were going to a false flag blaming syria for chemical weapons use and that is what syria uh... is saying on believable well his latest book is democrats and republicans bestseller we sell all of his books and info war store dot com and giving viewers a first look here's the new cover of what's coming out in october i really like it they killed our president
[02:11:15.180 --> 02:11:19.366]  And it goes over 63 facts that prove a conspiracy to kill JFK.
[02:11:19.386 --> 02:11:20.847]  This is the 50th anniversary.
[02:11:21.148 --> 02:11:27.336]  They've said no one allowed in the big park at Neely Plaza, but people that agree with the official story for the first time.
[02:11:27.376 --> 02:11:28.637]  So I'm going to be there with thousands.
[02:11:29.778 --> 02:11:31.239]  Demonstrating for the First Amendment.
[02:11:31.539 --> 02:11:34.120]  And I've invited Jesse Ventura to be there with us.
[02:11:34.560 --> 02:11:36.481]  He is considering it.
[02:11:36.862 --> 02:11:39.043]  And, Gov, you've been gone about five, six months.
[02:11:39.103 --> 02:11:40.263]  It's great to have you back.
[02:11:40.283 --> 02:11:41.144]  Thanks for coming on with us.
[02:11:41.504 --> 02:11:42.244]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:11:42.344 --> 02:11:43.145]  Great to be here.
[02:11:43.565 --> 02:11:47.547]  I'll tell you, I enjoyed my time in Mexico.
[02:11:47.587 --> 02:11:52.049]  I didn't watch television from January 2nd until about a couple weeks ago.
[02:11:54.391 --> 02:11:55.911]  I've seen you when you get back from Mexico.
[02:11:55.931 --> 02:11:56.952]  You look ten years younger.
[02:11:57.706 --> 02:11:59.067]  I feel 10 years younger too.
[02:11:59.087 --> 02:12:01.847]  You know what I did down there this year that was life changing?
[02:12:01.867 --> 02:12:02.888]  What was that?
[02:12:03.448 --> 02:12:13.491]  I went to, my wife and I, we took a 500 mile trip to this lagoon and you gotta go about 100 miles off the main road through this rough road to get there.
[02:12:14.412 --> 02:12:18.193]  And Mexicans in a small boat took us out into this lagoon.
[02:12:19.113 --> 02:12:25.016]  And the gray whales will come up to you, and you can sit in the boat and actually physically touch them.
[02:12:25.396 --> 02:12:25.736]  Wow.
[02:12:26.356 --> 02:12:30.839]  And mothers bring up their babies, and they actually lift them up.
[02:12:31.439 --> 02:12:35.721]  And I actually put my hands inside the whale's mouth and scratched their gums.
[02:12:38.871 --> 02:12:41.532]  You told me you were going to break a life-changing event here on air.
[02:12:41.572 --> 02:12:42.393]  That is amazing.
[02:12:43.273 --> 02:12:45.254]  I'll tell you, Alex, I can't describe.
[02:12:45.534 --> 02:12:48.756]  And when you look into their eyes, you see nothing but intelligence.
[02:12:49.496 --> 02:12:51.297]  And again, they approach you.
[02:12:51.337 --> 02:12:52.437]  You don't go to them.
[02:12:53.017 --> 02:12:55.519]  You go out there, and then they will come up to you.
[02:12:55.599 --> 02:12:58.000]  In this lagoon, there must have been at least 30 of them.
[02:13:01.521 --> 02:13:02.542]  That is just magic.
[02:13:02.562 --> 02:13:04.523]  Can you believe people ever hunted those?
[02:13:05.316 --> 02:13:18.084]  Well, I'll tell ya, I was so moved, I thought with my old frogman experience, I was ready to join those guys that go disable the ships that kill them, cause I got trained by the best, I know how to disable ships, that ain't a problem.
[02:13:23.148 --> 02:13:26.250]  Tell us how you sabotage the propellers and runners.
[02:13:29.019 --> 02:13:31.400]  No, because then they'll be able to defend against me.
[02:13:32.141 --> 02:13:49.950]  But, uh, no, it was, getting back to a more serious note, uh, it was really something, I mean, to, uh, the, the, the, we had one mother and her calf, she was 40 feet long, literally twice as long as our boat, and they must have stayed with us for an hour and 15 minutes.
[02:13:53.332 --> 02:13:58.195]  From what I've seen of the physiology, uh, they're basically the equivalent of, uh, like German Shepherds.
[02:13:59.843 --> 02:14:01.304]  I don't know.
[02:14:01.324 --> 02:14:03.224]  What it showed me, Alex, is this.
[02:14:03.324 --> 02:14:05.405]  Clearly they can communicate with each other.
[02:14:06.145 --> 02:14:14.748]  Because why would a mother, any mother of any animal, with the instinct, is not going to bring their children up to something that endangers them?
[02:14:15.369 --> 02:14:21.691]  So clearly they know, in this particular lagoon with the Mexicans, they know they're in no danger.
[02:14:22.933 --> 02:14:28.897]  And it was unique for me because I never felt any danger or any fear.
[02:14:29.418 --> 02:14:37.964]  There's just an aura about it that these big, massive, giant mammals that live in the water present no harm to you.
[02:14:38.364 --> 02:14:40.946]  They're actually curious to see what we are.
[02:14:43.789 --> 02:14:54.555]  In fact, they say that dolphins have the biggest brain of any mammal, CC size for their body weight, and they think they may be even smarter than humans.
[02:14:54.996 --> 02:15:01.840]  Well, back when I was in the Navy, we were already using, there was a small program the underwater demolition team had.
[02:15:01.960 --> 02:15:05.522]  I wasn't part of it, but I had a couple buddies that worked on it for a while.
[02:15:06.282 --> 02:15:07.023]  We're good to go.
[02:15:22.145 --> 02:15:30.950]  Well, I've got to say that I don't blame those killer whales locked up in cages that are the equivalent of like a hundred square foot prison cell.
[02:15:31.710 --> 02:15:35.312]  I don't blame them when they end up killing their trainers.
[02:15:35.392 --> 02:15:37.874]  That is incredibly inhumane.
[02:15:38.094 --> 02:15:42.216]  That's a great segue, Alex, because I'll comment on that and say, wait a minute.
[02:15:42.776 --> 02:15:49.040]  That's what our government wants to do to you and I. They want to lock us in cells to keep us safe.
[02:15:52.640 --> 02:15:54.101]  Absolutely, the whole nanny state.
[02:15:54.141 --> 02:15:54.681]  Break it down.
[02:15:54.701 --> 02:16:05.766]  No, I mean, it's like the joke, the cartoon I saw, where a mother, a father, and the two children are sitting at the dinner table, and they're all exclaiming, gee, I feel safe now.
[02:16:06.106 --> 02:16:08.327]  The only thing is, they're locked inside a cell.
[02:16:08.347 --> 02:16:11.008]  Well, that's what Eisenhower, he said.
[02:16:11.048 --> 02:16:13.229]  He said, total safety is total tyranny.
[02:16:13.249 --> 02:16:14.349]  Exactly.
[02:16:14.529 --> 02:16:15.069]  It's prison.
[02:16:15.390 --> 02:16:20.832]  It's like Ben Franklin said, for those who want to give up their liberty for security, shall have them deserve neither.
[02:16:21.869 --> 02:16:39.472]  Well, shifting gears into that, it's now out that everybody's being listened to, everything's being recorded, and thousands of corporations get contracts to give all your data to the government, and then they get to share it, and I've had telecom whistleblowers say that they can just dial in anybody's phone, turn it on, listen to you.
[02:16:39.752 --> 02:16:40.913]  It's all confirmed.
[02:16:41.313 --> 02:16:43.753]  Everything we talked about, now proven right.
[02:16:43.873 --> 02:16:45.874]  Al-Qaeda run by the government, now admitted.
[02:16:46.154 --> 02:16:47.374]  Do we get an apology, Governor?
[02:16:48.302 --> 02:16:49.103]  Absolutely not.
[02:16:49.203 --> 02:16:50.303]  I don't think so, Alex.
[02:16:50.363 --> 02:16:51.204]  We deserve one.
[02:16:51.224 --> 02:16:56.088]  Or we deserve the mainstream media to say to us, geez, you guys were right.
[02:16:58.329 --> 02:17:00.671]  You know what bugs me about it?
[02:17:00.751 --> 02:17:06.535]  Lindsey Graham and Feinstein and all these are telling the public that we need this to fight terrorism.
[02:17:06.555 --> 02:17:12.800]  Well, what they're saying to me and to every American is that they think you and I are terrorists.
[02:17:13.914 --> 02:17:18.896]  Because why do they need to listen in on my phone calls and my emails to fight terrorism?
[02:17:19.816 --> 02:17:20.597]  I'm not a terrorist!
[02:17:20.617 --> 02:17:20.817]  I do too!
[02:17:36.220 --> 02:17:46.769]  Because the thing to remember is all people like that and the military, you take an oath to protect the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
[02:17:46.829 --> 02:17:51.513]  And if somebody's asking you to do something that you feel violates the Bill of Rights,
[02:17:52.333 --> 02:17:55.796]  Well, you shouldn't do it, and that's what these whistleblowers are doing.
[02:17:55.856 --> 02:17:59.139]  They're simply telling us, the government lied to you.
[02:17:59.819 --> 02:18:01.801]  And yet, who's going to get prosecuted?
[02:18:01.881 --> 02:18:06.164]  Bradley Manning and him, all the- they prosecute the messenger.
[02:18:06.184 --> 02:18:15.372]  Now, how can they prosecute them when it's the government and other entities that are committing crimes, and you're reporting them?
[02:18:16.960 --> 02:18:21.741]  That's right, and when they reported it fast and furious within the ATF, they got in trouble.
[02:18:22.061 --> 02:18:26.082]  So you can't report within the chain because you've got criminals running the chain.
[02:18:26.622 --> 02:18:29.822]  Well, clearly it goes that deep in this country.
[02:18:30.182 --> 02:18:34.863]  People need to understand, like when I made the statement, I love my country but not my government.
[02:18:36.043 --> 02:18:38.864]  Bad people... Government is nothing but people.
[02:18:39.264 --> 02:18:42.325]  And bad people can get in charge if you don't believe it.
[02:18:42.385 --> 02:18:43.645]  Read about Germany in the 30s.
[02:18:46.544 --> 02:18:58.052]  Well, that's another... We had people getting in charge, and then of course, we brought so many damn... I read in books this last winter about all the Nazis we brought into this country that should have stood trial at Nuremberg.
[02:18:58.112 --> 02:19:01.014]  Instead, we brought them in here and gave them positions of authority.
[02:19:01.114 --> 02:19:09.360]  Well, my grandfather worked all over the Southwest in oil and gas, and the only places to go eat or stay were military bases a lot of the time in New Mexico, Arizona.
[02:19:10.020 --> 02:19:29.230]  West Texas and he told me when I was a child he almost got in fights all the time and got thrown out by MPs because he'd go into the restaurant and there'd be full of Nazis and SS and he was part German growing up in Dallas so he could speak some German and he'd hear the obnoxious things they were saying about America and it just blew him away.
[02:19:29.470 --> 02:19:31.691]  They were just crawling with Nazis.
[02:19:32.091 --> 02:19:43.119]  Well, you know, if that happened, we can thank Alan Dulles and all those people that, you know, decided that they were better off here in this country and operating here than putting them on trial for Nurnberg.
[02:19:43.159 --> 02:19:43.760]  Look what we did.
[02:19:44.280 --> 02:19:44.900]  Look what I did.
[02:19:44.940 --> 02:19:46.221]  Conspiracy theory.
[02:19:46.662 --> 02:19:52.726]  We found out that Eric Traub is the godfather of Plum Island, and this guy worked right underneath, I believe it was Himmler.
[02:19:53.226 --> 02:19:53.667]  And Mengele.
[02:19:54.787 --> 02:20:02.633]  And his expertise was biological warfare, infecting pigs and mosquitoes with agents to kill people.
[02:20:03.133 --> 02:20:10.258]  And lo and behold, we end up with Lyme disease, the first recorded case in Lyme, Connecticut, right across the water from Plum Island.
[02:20:13.038 --> 02:20:13.958]  It's just unbelievable.
[02:20:13.978 --> 02:20:17.360]  There's an article out today where they found a top Nazi living in Minnesota.
[02:20:17.380 --> 02:20:17.980]  Did you see that?
[02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:18.960]  No, I didn't.
[02:20:19.040 --> 02:20:20.521]  I don't watch the news.
[02:20:20.601 --> 02:20:22.481]  I'm lawfully ignorant.
[02:20:22.581 --> 02:20:25.943]  I don't read the paper and I still haven't watched the news since I came home.
[02:20:26.103 --> 02:20:28.844]  Yeah, top Nazi commander living in Minnesota since 1949.
[02:20:28.904 --> 02:20:31.164]  What do you think your dad would have thought of that?
[02:20:31.184 --> 02:20:32.885]  Well, who knows?
[02:20:33.025 --> 02:20:33.545]  I don't know.
[02:20:34.185 --> 02:20:38.287]  Like I said, nothing surprises me anymore here.
[02:20:40.506 --> 02:20:41.506]  It's totally creepy.
[02:20:41.546 --> 02:20:46.629]  I mean, and we know authoritarian regimes spy on people, and they always say it's for your own good.
[02:20:46.889 --> 02:20:48.709]  Alex, are we being sabotaged?
[02:20:48.810 --> 02:20:51.531]  I'm getting a whole bunch of interference over the line.
[02:20:52.551 --> 02:20:53.872]  I did just hear some of that.
[02:20:54.052 --> 02:20:55.933]  I'm not hearing you clearly, though.
[02:20:56.213 --> 02:21:01.335]  Okay, Governor, we're gonna call you back and reconnect, okay?
[02:21:02.964 --> 02:21:03.664]  All right, call me back.
[02:21:04.405 --> 02:21:09.749]  Actually, I got a call by a very famous spy yesterday going, Alex, we're monitoring you.
[02:21:10.429 --> 02:21:11.930]  Everything's fine, Alex.
[02:21:12.450 --> 02:21:13.871]  Because we were just talking about him.
[02:21:14.212 --> 02:21:15.052]  The phone rings.
[02:21:15.452 --> 02:21:17.734]  He goes, yes, we're monitoring you, Alex.
[02:21:19.075 --> 02:21:20.015]  You're too high.
[02:21:20.176 --> 02:21:21.016]  And I was like, what?
[02:21:21.076 --> 02:21:23.058]  And then his phone crackles and cuts out.
[02:21:23.078 --> 02:21:25.919]  And he calls back and he goes, and they're monitoring me.
[02:21:26.840 --> 02:21:28.381]  Can you imagine who it was I'm talking about?
[02:21:28.401 --> 02:21:29.162]  And he talks like that.
[02:21:32.125 --> 02:21:33.366]  It's probably just a bad phone line.
[02:21:33.946 --> 02:21:35.047]  That's probably all it is.
[02:21:36.508 --> 02:21:40.351]  Now, if they break on the line and say something to us, then we'll know the difference.
[02:21:42.813 --> 02:21:45.515]  But it is certainly a crazy world.
[02:21:45.556 --> 02:21:49.178]  I just skipped this network break, because when I get Jesse on, I always just enjoy talking to him so much.
[02:21:51.220 --> 02:21:55.944]  We're getting Governor Ventura back on the line right now, here with us.
[02:21:56.224 --> 02:21:59.366]  But yeah, guys, just call him back on the same phone line.
[02:21:59.406 --> 02:21:59.767]  It's fine.
[02:22:00.805 --> 02:22:02.086]  Alright, we don't need to make a big deal out of it.
[02:22:02.246 --> 02:22:03.186]  It's probably just a bad line.
[02:22:03.206 --> 02:22:04.387]  Alright?
[02:22:08.169 --> 02:22:09.650]  Or give me his number, I'll dial it if you want.
[02:22:11.411 --> 02:22:14.753]  Alright folks, again, we're here Monday through Friday.
[02:22:15.814 --> 02:22:16.635]  From 11 a.m.
[02:22:16.655 --> 02:22:17.235]  to 2 p.m.
[02:22:17.295 --> 02:22:18.576]  Central Standard Time.
[02:22:19.717 --> 02:22:23.861]  And the news websites are Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:22:23.881 --> 02:22:29.225]  We have the nightly news and then all my films and so much more at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:22:29.665 --> 02:22:30.686]  Why is it called Prison Planet?
[02:22:30.886 --> 02:22:36.992]  We're fighting the globalist construction of the whole world being a prison that Governor Ventura was just talking about.
[02:22:37.292 --> 02:22:39.414]  And the criminals that run both major parties are the
[02:22:40.074 --> 02:22:42.675]  Yeah, it's better, but there's still a little interference.
[02:22:42.715 --> 02:22:43.975]  I'm getting you clear right now.
[02:23:01.661 --> 02:23:02.462]  Okay, that's good.
[02:23:03.042 --> 02:23:16.051]  What do you make of it being openly said, okay, Al-Qaeda's the main force, something we talked about last year, and they are killing the Muslims, the minority groups, and the Christians and the Jews, but that's okay because Assad's a bad guy.
[02:23:16.571 --> 02:23:18.252]  Why do you think they're getting so bold?
[02:23:18.272 --> 02:23:20.974]  I mean, the agenda's out in the open, but they just move forward.
[02:23:21.695 --> 02:23:24.857]  It's all baffling to me, Alex.
[02:23:25.337 --> 02:23:29.120]  I'm still trying to figure out why we don't just get the hell out of the Middle East.
[02:23:30.501 --> 02:23:42.086]  I mean, if you look at history, uh, Anglo-Saxon European history, Christopher Columbus came here, and when he sailed here, it was to find a way to India to avoid the Middle East.
[02:23:43.326 --> 02:23:46.228]  So, centuries ago, nobody wanted to go there.
[02:23:46.948 --> 02:23:48.128]  They wanted to avoid it.
[02:23:48.689 --> 02:23:54.091]  And Columbus was willing to sail off the flat Earth at that time to take the chance to do it.
[02:23:54.851 --> 02:23:56.192]  Let's get the hell out of there.
[02:23:56.212 --> 02:23:58.693]  I mean, completely.
[02:24:00.157 --> 02:24:01.118]  I don't get it.
[02:24:01.158 --> 02:24:01.878]  I'll tell you what.
[02:24:02.679 --> 02:24:12.607]  If I run for President, I will follow the teachings of Major General Smedley Darlington Butler, who wrote the book War is a Racket, the two-time Congressional Medal of Honor winner.
[02:24:13.087 --> 02:24:18.272]  So anybody who wants to know my foreign policy, read General Butler's book and you'll know it.
[02:24:19.432 --> 02:24:21.874]  Talk about running for President.
[02:24:21.894 --> 02:24:23.836]  I've got a sneaking suspicion you're going to do it.
[02:24:24.236 --> 02:24:25.297]  Are you 30%, 50%, 80% sure you're going to run?
[02:24:28.302 --> 02:24:29.322]  I hate the gauntlet down.
[02:24:29.362 --> 02:24:30.682]  Here's what it'll take, Alex.
[02:24:30.783 --> 02:24:46.926]  It'll take, because I hate the bribery and raising the money, it'll take a grassroots movement to get me ballot access in all 50 states, and they will have to guarantee me we'll rise up and rebel if I'm not allowed in the debates, because you've got a debate to win.
[02:24:46.946 --> 02:24:52.007]  And if those two criterias are met, I will give it serious consideration.
[02:24:53.691 --> 02:24:55.073]  And here's what I will run on.
[02:24:55.333 --> 02:24:57.635]  I will run on the simplest thing you can imagine.
[02:24:58.295 --> 02:25:13.048]  I will give the American people, for the first time since George Washington, the father of our country, the opportunity to vote for a president that doesn't belong to either political party and is not bought off by corporate money or special interest PAC money.
[02:25:13.692 --> 02:25:18.313]  Well, I think you do stand a really good chance with Congress with a 10% approval rating.
[02:25:32.259 --> 02:25:33.219]  My issue is this.
[02:25:33.419 --> 02:25:37.161]  Why didn't the Libertarians approach you in the last cycle?
[02:25:37.201 --> 02:25:39.742]  Nothing against their candidate, but does anyone even remember their name?
[02:25:39.762 --> 02:25:42.823]  Yeah, their last candidate was Gary Johnson.
[02:25:43.043 --> 02:25:44.484]  I campaigned for him.
[02:25:44.764 --> 02:25:46.324]  Because I didn't want to run, Alex.
[02:25:47.225 --> 02:25:48.985]  The point is you've got to pick your battle.
[02:25:49.005 --> 02:25:54.047]  2016 is the most opportune time because they're bingo incumbent.
[02:25:54.447 --> 02:25:55.248]  No, no, I agree with you.
[02:25:57.580 --> 02:25:58.300]  Sure, absolutely.
[02:25:58.320 --> 02:25:58.641]  Sure, sure.
[02:26:18.604 --> 02:26:24.229]  No, I remember, I remember... 2016 is the best opportune time, and that's why I laid the gauntlet down.
[02:26:24.269 --> 02:26:28.032]  People got two years to get the ballot access, but I don't care.
[02:26:28.092 --> 02:26:29.493]  I don't want the Libertarian Party.
[02:26:29.893 --> 02:26:32.275]  I want to run with no political party.
[02:26:33.120 --> 02:26:35.202]  No, I remember you last year explaining all that.
[02:26:35.222 --> 02:26:36.303]  I was being sarcastic.
[02:26:36.343 --> 02:26:37.725]  I like Gary Johnson overall.
[02:26:38.025 --> 02:26:40.107]  I just meant he didn't get hardly any attention.
[02:26:40.147 --> 02:26:41.268]  We tried to give him attention.
[02:26:41.569 --> 02:26:46.133]  But people would have given attention to Jesse Ventura.
[02:26:46.153 --> 02:26:48.616]  And I think it may have made more of a statement
[02:26:49.356 --> 02:26:52.979]  Of course, I don't know what they do, but it all depends on what you're polling.
[02:26:53.119 --> 02:26:56.442]  I mean, if you're polling 2%, they're going to ignore you.
[02:27:13.942 --> 02:27:24.533]  But if you all of a sudden are polling 20% or better, well then, yeah, the mainstream media and the two parties, they're gonna come at you with both guns loaded.
[02:27:24.573 --> 02:27:26.094]  You'll see them team up on you.
[02:27:26.154 --> 02:27:32.180]  You know, all of a sudden, Democrats and Republicans will become bosom buddies when it comes to a third entity.
[02:27:32.741 --> 02:27:36.384]  But my belief is, what the hell more can they do to me, Alex?
[02:27:36.564 --> 02:27:36.965]  Nothing.
[02:27:37.825 --> 02:27:44.566]  They've already tried to marginalize me and they tell the world I'm crazy and all that stuff, but we know better than that.
[02:27:45.126 --> 02:27:49.187]  And the point is, I would go into the race pretty cavalier, really.
[02:27:49.587 --> 02:27:51.527]  Because, I mean, I have nothing to lose, do I?
[02:27:51.987 --> 02:27:52.168]  No.
[02:27:52.648 --> 02:27:53.208]  There you go.
[02:27:54.928 --> 02:28:01.429]  The only way you'd lose is by not taking action, because you could win, but regardless, you'd inject real issues.
[02:28:01.789 --> 02:28:06.310]  So either way you win by running, the only way you lose is by not running.
[02:28:08.252 --> 02:28:19.899]  I want some proof that the American people are going to stand with me, and the only way I see that is they're going to have to do a grassroots effort in all 50 states to get me on the ballot, get me ballot access.
[02:28:20.280 --> 02:28:23.942]  So it's now time for people to organize, and then you will step into the arena.
[02:28:24.362 --> 02:28:33.688]  When I see that I'm on, when I see that I've got ballot access, if I get it in all 50 states, I will give it very serious consideration.
[02:28:36.783 --> 02:28:37.904]  But that's what it'll take.
[02:28:38.105 --> 02:28:40.327]  So I figure I'll still be living in Mexico.
[02:28:40.347 --> 02:28:47.356]  I'll be ready, but the point is, it ain't gonna happen.
[02:28:47.416 --> 02:28:48.457]  I don't believe it will.
[02:28:49.218 --> 02:28:53.844]  I think they've been drinking too much water, they got too much Prozac in their bodies to care.
[02:28:57.109 --> 02:28:58.950]  People ask why Americans put up with so much.
[02:28:59.030 --> 02:29:02.891]  Our IQs have dropped about 20 points just from the hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[02:29:03.292 --> 02:29:06.373]  The roundups on record causing breast cancer to skyrocket.
[02:29:06.793 --> 02:29:09.654]  And we're all just basically narcotized, dying.
[02:29:10.334 --> 02:29:12.155]  We've been hit with a chemical attack.
[02:29:12.555 --> 02:29:14.276]  So you can't get mad at the public, Governor.
[02:29:14.296 --> 02:29:14.896]  They're victims.
[02:29:15.794 --> 02:29:21.440]  We're victims, but again, you know, like I said Alex, I'm not going to do it on my own.
[02:29:21.540 --> 02:29:25.365]  I've got to have the people with me and I need some sign that they will be.
[02:29:25.645 --> 02:29:26.926]  And that's the perfect way.
[02:29:27.447 --> 02:29:30.250]  Let me see ballot access in all 50 states.
[02:29:30.290 --> 02:29:31.672]  They've got two years to do it.
[02:29:34.278 --> 02:29:36.859]  Let's talk about how people can organize that on the other side.
[02:29:36.919 --> 02:29:39.941]  Get into your lawsuit that continues against Chris Kyle.
[02:29:39.981 --> 02:29:40.641]  Get your name back.
[02:29:41.662 --> 02:29:42.502]  And so much more.
[02:29:42.582 --> 02:29:46.024]  And some phone calls for former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura.
[02:29:46.064 --> 02:29:49.586]  His show still airs with huge audiences on TruTV.
[02:29:49.606 --> 02:29:50.966]  Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura.
[02:29:50.986 --> 02:29:52.827]  And we'll tell you about his new book that's coming out.
[02:29:52.847 --> 02:29:55.869]  800-259-9231 is the toll free number to join us to talk to Jesse Ventura.
[02:30:01.752 --> 02:30:04.736]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:30:04.756 --> 02:30:08.361]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:12.461 --> 02:30:14.102]  Introducing Pro-1.
[02:30:14.362 --> 02:30:17.865]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[02:30:18.005 --> 02:30:22.408]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[02:30:22.548 --> 02:30:28.532]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[02:30:28.652 --> 02:30:39.460]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.
[02:30:39.640 --> 02:30:42.322]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gates!
[02:30:42.503 --> 02:30:45.945]  We have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[02:30:46.146 --> 02:31:00.878]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands,
[02:31:01.298 --> 02:31:11.524]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[02:31:16.447 --> 02:31:17.367]  Tyranny is here.
[02:31:17.707 --> 02:31:21.409]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:31:21.570 --> 02:31:23.851]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:31:23.871 --> 02:31:29.254]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:31:29.714 --> 02:31:35.961]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:31:36.401 --> 02:31:41.947]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:31:42.367 --> 02:31:46.031]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[02:31:46.531 --> 02:31:50.512]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:31:50.832 --> 02:31:56.334]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:31:56.774 --> 02:31:59.735]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:32:00.336 --> 02:32:01.756]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:32:02.296 --> 02:32:02.816]  It's here.

[02:32:12.202 --> 02:32:14.123]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[02:32:14.143 --> 02:32:16.044]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[02:32:16.284 --> 02:32:21.748]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[02:32:21.968 --> 02:32:25.730]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[02:32:25.990 --> 02:32:29.712]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[02:32:29.892 --> 02:32:31.073]  The fact is, you are.
[02:32:31.273 --> 02:32:32.053]  We all are.
[02:32:32.294 --> 02:32:34.615]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[02:32:34.915 --> 02:32:43.201]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoodsDirect.
[02:32:43.402 --> 02:32:44.622]  Be prepared before you need it.
[02:32:44.783 --> 02:32:47.965]  With nutrient-dense food you can store for up to 25 years.
[02:32:48.245 --> 02:32:50.467]  You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed you.
[02:32:50.607 --> 02:32:55.010]  Do what I've done and get your own supply of the best storable foods out there from eFoodsDirect.

[02:33:05.177 --> 02:33:06.378]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:33:34.896 --> 02:33:35.716]  Monday through Friday.
[02:33:35.776 --> 02:33:36.617]  We're here folks.
[02:33:36.657 --> 02:33:37.177]  We're live.
[02:33:37.217 --> 02:33:39.518]  I'll be back live this Sunday.
[02:33:39.558 --> 02:33:40.978]  I was live from England last Sunday.
[02:33:41.379 --> 02:33:42.519]  I'll be live in studio.
[02:33:42.739 --> 02:33:43.059]  What is it?
[02:33:43.099 --> 02:33:43.700]  Father's Day.
[02:33:44.260 --> 02:33:46.661]  That's what I'm gonna do for Father's Day is fight for my children's future.
[02:33:46.681 --> 02:33:47.922]  4 to 6 p.m.
[02:33:47.962 --> 02:33:50.683]  Central Standard Time with the
[02:33:51.483 --> 02:33:56.005]  Sunday broadcast, InfoWars Nightly News, of course, tonight live, seven o'clock central.

[02:34:09.691 --> 02:34:13.893]  Create a unique one, and give it to friends and family, and give them the gift of waking up.
[02:34:14.513 --> 02:34:18.495]  Incredible films, high def, nightly news, it's all there.
[02:34:19.775 --> 02:34:20.435]  18 years of work.
[02:34:20.515 --> 02:34:21.756]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:34:21.776 --> 02:34:24.877]  Become a subscriber today and get Jesse Ventura's powerful book.
[02:34:24.917 --> 02:34:34.040]  You may be awake that the Democrats and Republicans are working together like they're all circling the wagons right now saying arrest the whistleblower, arrest the media.
[02:34:34.180 --> 02:34:37.562]  Boehner is saying it's evil to report on crimes.
[02:34:38.582 --> 02:34:39.303]  It's disgusting!
[02:34:39.363 --> 02:34:46.751]  You may know this, but this book is a powerful read and great to give to mainline Democrats and mainline Republicans to deprogram them.
[02:34:46.771 --> 02:34:56.502]  And we've got the book discounted at InfoWarStore.com, so you support the GOV and our media operation all at the same time, InfoWarStore.com.
[02:34:56.542 --> 02:34:58.024]  And I want to thank all of you for supporting
[02:34:59.127 --> 02:35:00.628]  The Broadcast and our Sponsors.
[02:35:29.607 --> 02:35:36.231]  Hogging too much, but he won't be back with us until the book comes out in October and he's promised us to come on first when he does those interviews.
[02:35:37.151 --> 02:35:52.160]  But expanding, expanding on what we were just talking about, dealing with the NSA and dealing with both parties circling the wagons and Congress having a 10% approval rating, I mean this just can't go on forever, Governor.
[02:35:52.880 --> 02:35:57.943]  What scenarios, you're a pretty politically savvy guy, what scenarios do you see unfolding?
[02:35:58.649 --> 02:36:07.037]  Well, uh, I, you know, again, I don't see any change naturally coming out of the two parties.
[02:36:07.077 --> 02:36:08.058]  They're going to come forward.
[02:36:08.098 --> 02:36:11.601]  I think we're going to end up with probably Hillary Clinton and maybe Jeb Bush.
[02:36:11.621 --> 02:36:12.161]  Ugh.
[02:36:14.181 --> 02:36:18.784]  Or, you know, Chris Christie might sneak in there, or whatever.
[02:36:18.804 --> 02:36:25.208]  But nothing's going to change as long as the two parties continue to control our government.
[02:36:25.808 --> 02:36:28.870]  People that think you're going to have change are sadly mistaken.
[02:36:28.930 --> 02:36:40.257]  I mean, Obama ran on complete opposite of George Bush, and yet when he got into office, he's rubber-stamped George Bush's policies and just carried on right forward.
[02:36:40.337 --> 02:36:41.298]  That's all you're going to get?
[02:36:41.818 --> 02:36:43.379]  No matter which side wins.
[02:36:44.060 --> 02:36:48.342]  So the real revolution in this country has to come by stop electing them.
[02:36:49.203 --> 02:36:51.104]  You know, is that feasible?
[02:36:51.264 --> 02:36:52.085]  Probably not.
[02:36:52.565 --> 02:36:54.627]  Because the people just, I don't know why.
[02:36:54.967 --> 02:37:01.071]  Like you talked about them having only a 10% approval rating, yet over 90% of them get re-elected.
[02:37:03.627 --> 02:37:11.153]  I agree with what you're saying, and there's a clip we'll play in a few minutes of Ralph Nader saying Obama may be the greatest con artist in history.
[02:37:11.173 --> 02:37:16.338]  Because with Bush, he would pretty much say what he was going to do, and it was atrocious to watch unfold.
[02:37:16.378 --> 02:37:20.281]  But with Obama, it's like his bombs are love bombs.
[02:37:20.581 --> 02:37:22.182]  His secret arrests are loving.
[02:37:23.283 --> 02:37:25.445]  Everything he does is... He's a Democrat.
[02:37:27.767 --> 02:37:28.648]  Yeah, it's disgusting.
[02:37:30.189 --> 02:37:34.774]  They do the same thing, but they pat you on the back while they're doing it.
[02:37:36.215 --> 02:37:39.238]  The Republicans kind of kick you right in the knee when they do it.
[02:37:39.799 --> 02:37:44.083]  The Democrats sidle up to you and put their arm around you, but they do the same thing.
[02:37:45.410 --> 02:37:46.251]  It's disgusting.
[02:37:46.911 --> 02:37:54.315]  Speaking of you running for president, I mean, hand out marching order specifics of what you'd like to see so you can run.
[02:37:54.335 --> 02:37:57.317]  And then I want to make the point, I mean, I'll make it now and get your comment.
[02:37:57.677 --> 02:38:09.724]  When I talk about dirty tricks and looking out, people that ask you to run better be ready to support you, whatever happens, because they already said you were in a, you know, fight with police, basically, when you weren't even in California.
[02:38:10.644 --> 02:38:13.167]  And it looks like it was Hulk Hogan, you know, in an argument with police.
[02:38:13.487 --> 02:38:19.452]  They already said that you were outside a bar, you know, saying, you know, down with the Navy, you know, SEALs, I'm glad they're dead.
[02:38:20.753 --> 02:38:22.555]  So that's what I wanted to ask you first off.
[02:38:22.855 --> 02:38:28.981]  Chris Kyle, how bizarre is it that he gets killed like that in very suspicious circumstances?
[02:38:29.782 --> 02:38:31.744]  And where is the lawsuit going right now?
[02:38:32.955 --> 02:38:33.396]  That's bizarre.
[02:38:33.496 --> 02:38:37.002]  I didn't learn about it over the internet when I was in Mexico.
[02:38:37.022 --> 02:38:45.738]  The lawsuit is that the way the law works now is his wife becomes the executive of his estate, so I'm forced to sue her, which I have done.
[02:38:46.613 --> 02:38:50.976]  Now, again, I have no beef with her at all, but that's the procedure you have to follow.
[02:38:51.636 --> 02:39:01.203]  And nobody, none of the attorneys on that side will offer an apology or will speak the truth, so we're heading to court, I guess, and I'm fully prepared to go.
[02:39:02.123 --> 02:39:15.212]  That would actually be the best for me, because when a jury and a judge find for me that everyone in the world that can do what it can to restore my reputation that he's tried to destroy for, and I don't know what reason.
[02:39:15.272 --> 02:39:16.233]  I've been cheated too.
[02:39:17.034 --> 02:39:25.465]  Because I certainly want him alive so we can put him on the stand and I'd like to know why he tried to throw me under the bus.
[02:39:25.545 --> 02:39:30.792]  Simply because I oppose the Iraq War, which any citizen has a right to do that.
[02:39:34.689 --> 02:39:40.412]  You know, so I've been cheated too, but the procedure says that I have to move forward and bring the lawsuit against her.
[02:39:40.772 --> 02:39:48.717]  And I know Bill O'Reilly got on TV or something last week and looked into the camera and told me to do the right thing and drop the lawsuit.
[02:39:49.197 --> 02:39:55.721]  Well, of course he's going to say that because he's part of News Corp, and News Corp is also part of this publishing company.
[02:39:56.502 --> 02:40:00.164]  And believe me, if I win this lawsuit, I'm coming after them next.
[02:40:01.548 --> 02:40:02.229]  Absolutely.
[02:40:02.289 --> 02:40:04.231]  Look, I told you day one.
[02:40:04.271 --> 02:40:09.296]  They timed it right when you went over the border, knowing you don't have a cell phone, knowing it took you days to get out there.
[02:40:09.316 --> 02:40:10.137]  She couldn't respond.
[02:40:10.398 --> 02:40:11.999]  They were already putting out dirty tricks.
[02:40:12.180 --> 02:40:13.581]  I've been the victim of these as well.
[02:40:14.202 --> 02:40:17.725]  And they were already engaged in that to try to destroy you.
[02:40:18.006 --> 02:40:19.848]  He was put up to it to sell the books.
[02:40:20.488 --> 02:40:21.269]  Undoubtedly.
[02:40:21.969 --> 02:40:25.351]  And then he's mysteriously killed when you start winning the court case.
[02:40:25.711 --> 02:40:27.312]  I mean, for those that don't know, you were winning.
[02:40:27.372 --> 02:40:28.233]  It's going forward.
[02:40:28.633 --> 02:40:29.474]  You have witnesses.
[02:40:29.514 --> 02:40:29.994]  He didn't.
[02:40:30.054 --> 02:40:31.095]  You're going to win this.
[02:40:31.455 --> 02:40:42.902]  Now he's dead because when he was involved in very high-level national security shadowy operations and bragged in his book that he told lies in the media and engaged in psyops.
[02:40:44.543 --> 02:40:46.705]  Well, I don't know.
[02:40:46.985 --> 02:40:56.293]  I can't make any statements concerning that at all, Alex.
[02:40:56.373 --> 02:40:56.974]  I don't know.
[02:40:57.494 --> 02:41:06.762]  All I know is that my main objective has always been, and I offered it to him a year ago, the first time I ever met him at a preliminary conference,
[02:41:07.703 --> 02:41:12.928]  All it would have taken then was an apology and to admit that the story didn't happen and he wouldn't do it.
[02:41:13.509 --> 02:41:19.254]  And so now it's been a year later and thousands upon thousands of lawyer dollars spent.
[02:41:20.055 --> 02:41:22.497]  I'm so far into it now I have to see it today.
[02:41:22.517 --> 02:41:23.557]  We're good to go.
[02:41:42.469 --> 02:41:43.009]  Absolutely.
[02:41:43.029 --> 02:41:50.374]  We saw the good news with the Supreme Court ruling that they can't patent our genes and then not let us have our own genes as a treatment.
[02:41:50.414 --> 02:41:58.839]  But getting back to this, I just want to be a character witness here for you, getting to fly around with you, getting to know you over the last now seven, eight years, time flies.
[02:42:00.160 --> 02:42:03.782]  The only time, and the truth is you're, you know, you're a big sentimental teddy bear.
[02:42:04.122 --> 02:42:10.185]  The only time I've seen you tear up is when you see troops in the airport or veterans or people with their arms or legs blown off.
[02:42:10.665 --> 02:42:17.949]  I've seen you repeatedly talk about, that's why I oppose the war, you know, is because of what it does to my fellow people in uniform.
[02:42:17.969 --> 02:42:19.330]  Yeah, I know you're sentimental.
[02:42:19.350 --> 02:42:21.911]  Your dad won a bunch of battle stars in the Battle of the Bulge.
[02:42:21.931 --> 02:42:27.054]  You know, you come from a military family and I, and I don't want to sit here and get sappy, but I mean,
[02:42:27.794 --> 02:42:34.736]  That's why it's such an evil lie to say you'd go to a Navy SEAL commencement and then you'd say Navy SEALS deserve to die.
[02:42:34.756 --> 02:42:37.537]  Well Alex, that would also be suicidal.
[02:42:37.557 --> 02:42:42.099]  That would be the equivalent of going to the Hell's Angels clubhouse and telling them they suck.
[02:42:42.779 --> 02:42:44.520]  You know, come on!
[02:42:45.670 --> 02:42:51.576]  And the point of the matter is that I view our soldiers and sailors and airmen as victims.
[02:42:51.656 --> 02:42:54.438]  You know, war happens because of failed politics.
[02:42:55.059 --> 02:42:57.361]  Politicians are the cause of war.
[02:42:58.161 --> 02:43:02.966]  The poor service people are just a tool they use, and they're victims also.
[02:43:03.126 --> 02:43:04.767]  And your mother was in North Africa.
[02:43:06.127 --> 02:43:06.567]  Absolutely.
[02:43:06.607 --> 02:43:09.128]  Just as a bottomless pit to make no-bid contracts.
[02:43:34.341 --> 02:43:35.403]  What's successful about it?
[02:43:35.443 --> 02:43:36.684]  What did we accomplish?
[02:43:37.645 --> 02:43:38.166]  What's changed?
[02:43:38.186 --> 02:43:38.647]  Nothing!
[02:43:40.973 --> 02:43:44.095]  But big, big banks siphon trillions of dollars out of taxpayers.
[02:43:44.596 --> 02:43:52.301]  Well, other than that, yeah, other than Halliburton getting rich, that's why I wrote the preface for a book they're bringing out.
[02:43:52.741 --> 02:43:58.826]  They're bringing out General Smedley Butler's anti-war book from the two-time Congressional Medal of Honor Marine.
[02:43:59.206 --> 02:44:00.047]  They're republishing it?
[02:44:00.067 --> 02:44:04.910]  They're redoing his book, Sky Horse, called War is a Racket, and I did the preface for it.
[02:44:05.370 --> 02:44:10.574]  And I think every kid in America should be required to read this book before they graduate from high school.
[02:44:10.774 --> 02:44:11.114]  I've read it.
[02:44:11.174 --> 02:44:12.114]  It's a short, good book.
[02:44:12.154 --> 02:44:13.715]  We should carry that as soon as it comes out.
[02:44:13.735 --> 02:44:18.056]  We carry most of Sky Horse's great material at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:44:18.096 --> 02:44:23.377]  Speaking of the book, you were telling me off air why you're doing this JFK book and that you want to make a statement about that.
[02:44:23.397 --> 02:44:37.420]  Well, I'm doing the JFK book because for my own selfish reasons, I want for whatever, you know, whether anyone cares a hundred years from now or not, I want them to know that the 38th Governor of Minnesota, Jesse Ventura,
[02:44:38.500 --> 02:44:44.282]  Does not agree with the Warren Commission and the government's official story on the murder of John F. Kennedy.
[02:44:44.962 --> 02:44:50.944]  And the only way I felt I could really truly do that is to write a book about it and then it'll be definitive.
[02:44:51.044 --> 02:44:59.466]  Anyone that reads it will know that Jesse Ventura certainly does not believe what he was told by our government or the results of the Warren Commission.
[02:45:00.506 --> 02:45:02.887]  Just briefly getting back to Chris Kyle before we go to calls.
[02:45:03.827 --> 02:45:06.748]  Any way you slice it, it was bad luck to lie about you.
[02:45:08.806 --> 02:45:09.427]  I don't know.
[02:45:09.527 --> 02:45:11.148]  I don't know about that at all.
[02:45:11.688 --> 02:45:14.710]  All I know is that the story was not true.
[02:45:14.790 --> 02:45:15.751]  It never happened.
[02:45:16.291 --> 02:45:17.892]  And I will defend until the end.
[02:45:18.693 --> 02:45:23.176]  And I will seek out the only way that I can clear myself.
[02:45:23.576 --> 02:45:25.117]  And that's through our court system.
[02:45:25.197 --> 02:45:33.363]  And so I really hope people aren't angry at me because the media tries to make it look like I'm going after... It's never been about money.
[02:45:33.923 --> 02:45:35.004]  It's been about the truth.
[02:45:35.565 --> 02:45:41.630]  And the media makes it look like I'm going after this widow and her family, now this war hero.
[02:45:42.311 --> 02:45:44.013]  And that isn't the case at all.
[02:45:44.093 --> 02:45:49.778]  It's what I have to do to clear my name for the slanderous things of being called a traitor to my country.
[02:45:50.131 --> 02:45:54.373]  Well, one of the worst ways to hurt somebody is to say you're glad troops are dying.
[02:45:54.413 --> 02:45:56.634]  I mean, exactly.
[02:45:56.674 --> 02:46:03.298]  And now they're telling you you need to shut up after News Corp was with glee reporting that for months on air.
[02:46:03.318 --> 02:46:04.698]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:46:05.179 --> 02:46:11.582]  And now Bill O'Reilly wants me to drop the lawsuit after he reports on it multiple times.
[02:46:12.362 --> 02:46:13.823]  We're good to go.
[02:46:29.135 --> 02:46:30.917]  Let me tell you what he did to me two weeks ago.
[02:46:31.338 --> 02:46:33.480]  I never talk about sex stuff on the show.
[02:46:33.500 --> 02:46:38.207]  I haven't settled stuff for sexual harassment with people like he has.
[02:46:38.587 --> 02:46:41.411]  He plays a clip of me yelling about something completely different.
[02:46:41.431 --> 02:46:45.756]  It was about war and says this is the type of hate speech against women.
[02:46:46.297 --> 02:46:48.278]  Well not only that Alex, but it's extremely expensive.
[02:47:09.921 --> 02:47:16.228]  When you bring litigation like I have, it costs a great deal.
[02:47:16.248 --> 02:47:22.435]  See, insurance companies are paying the other side, so it's truthfully me against the big insurance company or the publisher.
[02:47:24.618 --> 02:47:25.619]  Not against the wife.
[02:47:26.981 --> 02:47:30.725]  And what they try to do is they try to run you out of money.
[02:47:32.051 --> 02:47:39.116]  You know, they wait until the 11th hour and hope that you'll go away and hope that public pressure will cause you to, you know, give up what you believe in.
[02:47:39.676 --> 02:47:41.437]  And they hope to run you out of money.
[02:47:42.338 --> 02:47:47.221]  And unfortunately, I have enough money that they can't run me out of it to get a case to court.
[02:47:47.742 --> 02:47:50.664]  And so we will go to court next, uh, in August, I guess.
[02:47:51.511 --> 02:47:52.231]  Unbelievable.
[02:47:53.912 --> 02:47:57.973]  I've got a few other points I want to get to, but we'll cover that after we take calls.
[02:47:58.013 --> 02:48:04.396]  But any other points, things in the news, things that are happening, Governor Ventura, that you want to impart to our audience?
[02:48:05.216 --> 02:48:06.396]  Oh no, not really.
[02:48:06.416 --> 02:48:08.757]  I'm just enjoying being back.
[02:48:08.817 --> 02:48:11.098]  I wish Tiger was doing a little better in the U.S.
[02:48:11.198 --> 02:48:11.538]  Open.
[02:48:12.779 --> 02:48:14.459]  So you're rooting for Tiger?
[02:48:14.479 --> 02:48:15.900]  Yeah.
[02:48:16.698 --> 02:48:22.481]  I want to see him come back and win another major because it'll slap all the pundits and all the media right in the nose.
[02:48:22.601 --> 02:48:27.623]  Yeah, I don't get why he's choked so bad, but I think it was probably a narcissist and it kind of collapsed his worldview.
[02:48:27.703 --> 02:48:29.164]  He doesn't choke, it's golf.
[02:48:29.184 --> 02:48:31.385]  Nobody chokes.
[02:48:31.505 --> 02:48:33.146]  It's a difficult game, Alex.
[02:48:33.406 --> 02:48:40.109]  You could have the wheels come off on any hole if that club face is off by one sixteenth of an inch.
[02:48:41.368 --> 02:48:46.709]  Well, when you hit a 300-yard shot, that's... I know that, but he won so many and now he's won none.
[02:48:47.050 --> 02:48:49.430]  I'm saying he's collectively... No, no, no, no.
[02:48:49.470 --> 02:48:51.611]  He's won more this year than he ever has.
[02:48:51.651 --> 02:48:53.151]  He just hasn't won a major.
[02:48:54.692 --> 02:48:56.992]  He's won five tournaments this year, I think.
[02:48:58.913 --> 02:49:00.133]  Well, he's definitely a wild man.
[02:49:00.153 --> 02:49:01.554]  Let's talk to Mike in Oregon.
[02:49:01.614 --> 02:49:02.454]  Mike, you're on the air.
[02:49:02.474 --> 02:49:02.854]  Go ahead.
[02:49:05.207 --> 02:49:06.628]  Uh, hello gentlemen, how's it going?
[02:49:06.789 --> 02:49:07.989]  We're doing good, you got a question?
[02:49:08.310 --> 02:49:08.890]  We're good, go ahead.
[02:49:08.910 --> 02:49:09.651]  Yes sir, I do.
[02:49:09.851 --> 02:49:11.672]  Yes, for the governor.
[02:49:12.753 --> 02:49:32.428]  Sir, I could have swore you had mentioned on this show or earlier, perhaps maybe a year or so ago, about if you were elected president you might actually consider legislation on forcing Congress and Senators and so forth, elected officials like that, preventing them from actually retiring.
[02:49:32.929 --> 02:49:34.630]  And I've been thinking about that and
[02:49:35.245 --> 02:49:40.607]  If there was such a thing, would that not certainly reduce a great amount of corruption right off the bat?
[02:49:41.688 --> 02:49:42.628]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:49:42.668 --> 02:49:46.230]  There should never be a retirement for what they call public service.
[02:49:47.190 --> 02:49:48.250]  Right, yeah, exactly.
[02:49:48.270 --> 02:49:52.412]  That would bring you term limits without implementing them.
[02:49:52.912 --> 02:49:57.914]  Because nobody's gonna sit there and get elected for 25 years and not get a retirement from it.
[02:49:58.595 --> 02:50:01.956]  And then you bring in people to government that aren't just there to try to feather their nest.
[02:50:03.067 --> 02:50:05.249]  You bring people in like it was designed.
[02:50:05.310 --> 02:50:09.914]  You go there to serve, and when you're done serving, you go back to what you used to do.
[02:50:10.435 --> 02:50:13.398]  It's a classic way to eliminate career politicians.
[02:50:13.999 --> 02:50:15.320]  That's why they won't do it.
[02:50:17.242 --> 02:50:23.429]  Well Governor, I think that if you go ahead and we make this happen for you, I think honestly
[02:50:24.045 --> 02:50:27.047]  That would be some great, great laws passed.
[02:50:27.327 --> 02:50:28.427]  Thank you, Mike.
[02:50:28.467 --> 02:50:30.848]  Remember, Mike, I can't pass a law.
[02:50:30.908 --> 02:50:33.910]  People need to understand that according to our Constitution.
[02:50:34.747 --> 02:50:40.652]  The President, although you'd wonder about it today, but the President can't pass a law, only the Congress.
[02:50:40.692 --> 02:50:45.096]  That's right, so even if Ron Paul would have gotten elected, they would have tried to block him, so it's just one step.
[02:50:45.836 --> 02:50:51.321]  Ron Paul, we're going to break, Governor, but Ron Paul, would you try to have him on your cabinet as an advisor if you won the presidency?
[02:50:51.661 --> 02:50:57.806]  Oh, I certainly would love to have any participation Congressman Paul would give me, absolutely.
[02:50:57.846 --> 02:50:58.847]  How about head of the Treasury?
[02:51:01.181 --> 02:51:03.642]  Yeah, I'll make Ron Paul Treasury Secretary.
[02:51:03.882 --> 02:51:05.342]  All right, final segment.
[02:51:05.642 --> 02:51:08.763]  All right, final segment with Governor Jesse Ventura.
[02:51:09.043 --> 02:51:12.664]  Coming up, ladies and gentlemen, follow him at Facebook at Official Jesse Ventura.

[02:52:20.299 --> 02:52:28.648]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.

[02:53:41.401 --> 02:53:50.673]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it lent back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[02:53:50.733 --> 02:53:51.454]  This capitalism?
[02:53:51.514 --> 02:53:57.622]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:53:57.762 --> 02:53:58.543]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[02:53:58.583 --> 02:54:01.685]  I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[02:54:01.745 --> 02:54:04.988]  Call for your copy at 800-686-2237.
[02:54:05.148 --> 02:54:06.449]  It's time to understand the system.
[02:54:06.509 --> 02:54:08.791]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:54:08.831 --> 02:54:09.552]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:54:10.753 --> 02:54:19.060]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:19.721 --> 02:54:22.043]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:54:23.334 --> 02:54:25.596]  All right, Jesse Ventura leaves us here in about six minutes.
[02:54:25.636 --> 02:54:27.157]  I'm going to jam in a few more of your phone calls.
[02:54:27.237 --> 02:54:28.197]  I'll continue with calls.
[02:54:28.578 --> 02:54:30.779]  We've got a guest on about the immigration reform stuff.
[02:54:31.600 --> 02:54:35.322]  Governor, I was telling you, you were saying you had an incredible experience with these gray wells.
[02:54:35.342 --> 02:54:38.004]  And I was saying, I didn't think Stonehenge would do anything.
[02:54:38.024 --> 02:54:39.025]  I was like, oh, it's boring.
[02:54:39.385 --> 02:54:40.105]  Why'd we go here?
[02:54:40.165 --> 02:54:42.767]  I walked across what they said was the ley line without them telling me.
[02:54:43.127 --> 02:54:44.488]  And I was like electrified.
[02:54:44.528 --> 02:54:46.490]  I felt like I was 18.
[02:54:46.530 --> 02:54:48.151]  And everybody else I was with felt it.
[02:54:48.191 --> 02:54:50.532]  My mother, when she was there a decade ago, said she felt that.
[02:54:51.253 --> 02:54:53.194]  And you told me a similar story.
[02:54:53.275 --> 02:54:53.459]  Yeah.
[02:54:54.229 --> 02:55:08.738]  Well, yeah, when I went to the pyramids, when I was governor, I did a trade mission to Mexico and they took me to the pyramids and we walked to the top of the pyramids and right at the top there was a group of Mexicans, maybe three or four, who had their hand placed right on the center.
[02:55:09.459 --> 02:55:11.360]  And I inquired, I said, what are they doing?
[02:55:11.380 --> 02:55:16.403]  And they said, well, they believe the pyramid has energy and the energy is transferring to them.
[02:55:17.024 --> 02:55:18.605]  So I thought, hmm, this is interesting.
[02:55:18.645 --> 02:55:22.567]  So I went over and I put my hand down there and I left it there for about 10 minutes.
[02:55:22.947 --> 02:55:23.508]  And it's true.
[02:55:24.642 --> 02:55:26.183]  You know how I know it's true, Alex?
[02:55:26.203 --> 02:55:27.244]  How?
[02:55:27.744 --> 02:55:32.188]  Because I had way more energy going down the pyramid than I had coming up.
[02:55:33.609 --> 02:55:34.029]  I bet.
[02:55:34.109 --> 02:55:35.030]  No, let me tell you.
[02:55:35.190 --> 02:55:37.972]  I got... I'm not gonna go... I got pretty excited.
[02:55:38.052 --> 02:55:39.773]  I mean, it was... No, I know.
[02:55:40.093 --> 02:55:40.794]  That's a joke.
[02:55:40.814 --> 02:55:44.076]  You know, I did have fun with that because I told my security that too.
[02:55:44.136 --> 02:55:45.257]  I said, God, this works.
[02:55:45.397 --> 02:55:49.400]  I said, I got way more energy going down this pyramid than I had going up it.
[02:55:49.580 --> 02:55:49.981]  Exactly.
[02:55:50.001 --> 02:55:51.802]  But I mean, did you really feel the energy, though?
[02:55:52.142 --> 02:55:53.683]  No, I can't say that I did.
[02:55:53.703 --> 02:56:02.647]  You know, I'm not going to tell you that I sat there and, you know, all of a sudden, you know, my ears perked up or I felt electricity going through my body.
[02:56:02.707 --> 02:56:03.547]  No, I did not.
[02:56:03.587 --> 02:56:05.888]  But it's not to say that it isn't true.
[02:56:06.348 --> 02:56:12.071]  You know, there's a lot of things we don't know about in this universe that we aren't aware of.
[02:56:12.111 --> 02:56:13.471]  I mean, it's just a magnetic field.
[02:56:13.531 --> 02:56:13.911]  Exactly.
[02:56:13.931 --> 02:56:16.633]  You know, I mean, I think it's kind of, it felt like when I was in a room with a big
[02:56:18.723 --> 02:56:24.528]  At the Midwestern American Museum, they turned on the biggest above-ground Tesla coil, and you feel it.
[02:56:24.548 --> 02:56:30.712]  I mean, I felt that and knew what it was, and I felt something like that, and I think it's electricity coming out of the earth, kind of like the poles.
[02:56:31.073 --> 02:56:36.157]  Always remember that you have a flow of electricity that goes through your body.
[02:56:36.617 --> 02:56:39.259]  That's what any acupuncturist taps into.
[02:56:39.499 --> 02:56:39.960]  Exactly.
[02:56:41.881 --> 02:56:51.084]  You know, there's a lot of things we don't know and understand, and I think that, you know, in the old days, anything we didn't know or understand, we attributed to God.
[02:56:51.624 --> 02:56:56.786]  Well, today we understand a lot more things, so we don't necessarily attribute everything to Him.
[02:56:56.966 --> 02:56:58.306]  Let's jam in a few more calls.
[02:56:58.446 --> 02:57:00.227]  Anthony in Miami, quick question for Jesse.
[02:57:01.207 --> 02:57:02.787]  Hello, Mr. Governor, how you doing?
[02:57:03.008 --> 02:57:10.590]  I'm a big fan of yours, and I believe that you will be the greatest man to be president next, and I wanted to know,
[02:57:11.656 --> 02:57:16.499]  If elected president, would you prosecute the true perpetrators of 9-11?
[02:57:17.360 --> 02:57:24.544]  Well, first of all, you would need to get... Before you could prosecute anybody, you'd need to have a real investigation of it.
[02:57:25.928 --> 02:57:30.009]  That's where you have to start off is at an unbiased investigation.
[02:57:30.049 --> 02:57:41.033]  The thing people need to understand when all of these, the 9-11 Commission, the Warren Commission, and all that, they're always there to prop up the official story.
[02:57:41.754 --> 02:57:46.535]  And the reason that it's called the official story is generally it's to protect officials.
[02:57:46.675 --> 02:57:48.116]  Absolutely, let's jam in one more.
[02:57:48.416 --> 02:57:50.677]  Jonathan in New York, you're on the air with Ventura.
[02:57:50.957 --> 02:57:51.637]  Ask your question.
[02:57:52.397 --> 02:57:53.618]  Hey Jesse man, how's it going?
[02:57:53.758 --> 02:57:53.978]  Good.
[02:57:54.878 --> 02:57:55.038]  Good.
[02:57:55.058 --> 02:57:55.759]  A quick question.
[02:57:55.859 --> 02:57:57.481]  I want to know your opinion.
[02:57:57.621 --> 02:58:04.889]  Do you think the American people will finally wake up with 9-11 if there was like an official whistleblower to blow that story apart?
[02:58:05.589 --> 02:58:11.075]  Probably not because the mainstream media won't allow the whistleblower the light of day.
[02:58:11.596 --> 02:58:16.361]  I saw it this past fall in Chicago when Judith Barry Baker came from Sweden.
[02:58:16.961 --> 02:58:30.870]  She was Lee Harvey Oswald's lover in New Orleans, and she can testify that she went to dinner with Jack Ruby and Lee Oswald on multiple occasions, and that Lee was a paid government agent.
[02:58:30.890 --> 02:58:37.775]  She couldn't get any press there because they will not cover it, and I think the same thing would hold true at 9-11.
[02:58:38.055 --> 02:58:40.196]  Yeah, people say if this was happening, people would go public.
[02:58:40.396 --> 02:58:41.717]  Cybele Edmonds was at the NSA.
[02:58:41.737 --> 02:58:43.018]  She heard the government running the attacks.
[02:58:43.398 --> 02:58:44.939]  Governor, we'll talk to you again soon.
[02:58:45.219 --> 02:58:45.560]  Thanks for...
[02:58:48.159 --> 02:58:56.663]  There is an increased need to support our immunity and health.
