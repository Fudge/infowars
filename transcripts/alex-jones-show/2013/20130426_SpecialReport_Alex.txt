[00:00:03.194 --> 00:00:06.475]  Hi, I'm Leanne McAdoo here with an InfoWars News Bulletin.
[00:00:06.955 --> 00:00:26.099]  Now we've been working really hard to try and keep track of all of the inconsistencies with the official story behind the Boston Marathon bombing and there are so many of them that I'm going to just try to focus on five here today and then you can go to InfoWars.com and check out some additional articles that will detail all of the inconsistencies even further.
[00:00:27.654 --> 00:00:31.198]  The media announced that the suspects were in custody at the Boston courthouse.
[00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:39.128]  The courthouse is suddenly evacuated due to a bomb threat and the new official word is there are no suspects in custody.
[00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.503]  FBI releases footage of the suspects without ever showing them actually setting down the backpack.
[00:00:46.864 --> 00:00:50.266]  In fact, even Governor Deval Patrick had not seen the video.
[00:00:50.426 --> 00:01:02.633]  Although he described the footage showing the suspect placing the bomb near the second blast site as chilling, he then mentioned that he hadn't actually seen the footage himself, but was relayed the info by the FBI.
[00:01:03.054 --> 00:01:08.897]  So, you're the governor of Massachusetts, overseeing this manhunt, and you yourself haven't even seen the footage?
[00:01:09.998 --> 00:01:15.282]  The boy's father says that if the FBI kills his second son, then he will know it was a setup.
[00:01:15.802 --> 00:01:20.666]  Hours later, the boy is captured alive, but is conveniently unable to speak.
[00:01:20.706 --> 00:01:26.290]  Reports say that he suffered from a self-inflicted gunshot wound through the mouth that exited his neck.
[00:01:26.851 --> 00:01:33.656]  How does a person who's just shot himself in the mouth climb out and over a boat, surrendering himself to authorities?
[00:01:34.901 --> 00:01:48.906]  As Alex Jones reported, the Saudi national suspect, named first as a person of interest, was almost immediately cleared of suspicion after both John Kerry and Obama met with Saudi Foreign Minister Saad just after the Boston Marathon bombing.
[00:01:49.267 --> 00:01:55.169]  We were then told Abdul Rahman Ali Alarbi is being deported for reasons of national security.
[00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:09.720]  The blaze released more information showing that the FBI was deporting him under section 212.3b and that he was linked somehow to the Boston bombings, but after the president's meeting with the foreign minister, the file was changed.
[00:02:10.885 --> 00:02:20.295]  We now know the Alarbi clan has major ties to Al Qaeda, and although the 20-year-old was already on a terrorist watch list, he was still given a student visa.
[00:02:20.675 --> 00:02:26.861]  This is all strangely similar to the flights by the Bin Laden family, who are also Saudi nationals, right after 9-11.
[00:02:29.147 --> 00:02:32.728]  Why did the FBI ask for the public's help in finding these guys?
[00:02:32.968 --> 00:02:38.790]  It's already widely reported that the FBI had been alerted to Tomerlin Tsarnaev at least as early as 2011.
[00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:51.513]  Homeland Security said they reviewed the man's associations with suspected extremists, his travel and education history, and concluded that there wasn't incriminating information to prove he had extremist leanings.
[00:02:52.353 --> 00:02:58.999]  Is this just another case of the FBI allowing a terror attack to take place in order to take advantage of a crisis?
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:07.126]  Now we would just like to say thank you to everyone who's been sharing your information, sending it to tips at InfoWars.com.
