[00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:13.370]  We've all heard of the free Obama phone.
[00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.493]  We know that Obama used the free Obama phone to reach more people during the campaign.
[00:00:28.581 --> 00:00:31.962]  Did you know to get a free Obama phone, all you have to do is income qualify?
[00:00:32.722 --> 00:00:34.943]  And you don't really have to necessarily show proof.
[00:00:35.463 --> 00:00:43.165]  They say you're supposed to get food stamps, some kind of government assistance, or be on welfare, but a lot of times people can get a phone without any proof at all.
[00:00:43.665 --> 00:00:45.726]  Like all good ideas, they start off great.
[00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:49.667]  Then the government gets a hold of it, bloats it up, and then it gets out of control.
[00:00:50.427 --> 00:00:53.088]  The Obama Phone Program is called Lifeline.
[00:00:53.509 --> 00:01:06.375]  It's provided by Safelink Wireless, which is a program for income-eligible households, provided by Tracfone Wireless, owned by America Movil, which belongs to Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim.
[00:01:06.952 --> 00:01:20.767]  So Mexico is funding Obama's campaign through the Obama phone and the tax you pay on your cell phone goes back to Mexico so that they can provide phones and service to the enslaved welfare recipients so that they can continue to vote to keep their free phones.
