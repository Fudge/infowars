[00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:07.015]  I'm Leanne McAdoo and this is an InfoWars News Bulletin.
[00:00:07.635 --> 00:00:13.998]  Liberty was also attacked in Boston last week in an alarming scene that was scarier than the bombing event itself.
[00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.640]  Forced lockdown of an entire city.
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.901]  Military tanks riding through the streets.
[00:00:19.341 --> 00:00:26.388]  Warrant lists door-to-door searches by 1,500 militarized police, forcing families out of their homes at gunpoint.
[00:00:26.729 --> 00:00:34.476]  What may look like a scene from the latest big-budget Hollywood movie was actually America's first taste of martial law following the Boston bombing.
[00:00:34.857 --> 00:00:37.960]  Ron Paul called the scene deeply disturbing in a recent interview.
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.883]  Those pictures really concern me.
[00:00:40.983 --> 00:00:48.630]  That is such a visual image when you see thousands and thousands of troops, and they weren't your local friendly policemen that were involved.
[00:00:48.731 --> 00:00:51.313]  I mean, can you imagine all these people being locked?
[00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:52.374]  They became prisoners.
[00:00:52.654 --> 00:00:55.117]  It was accepted too easily.
[00:00:55.497 --> 00:00:57.459]  It was martial law.
[00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.883]  Even gun-grabbing liberal Bill Maher sees the writing on the wall.
[00:01:01.323 --> 00:01:04.167]  Show some of the pictures of the Boston police, okay?
[00:01:04.467 --> 00:01:04.988]  Look at this.
[00:01:05.428 --> 00:01:09.173]  I mean, if this is what you have, why don't you invade a country?
[00:01:10.555 --> 00:01:11.576]  Show some of the other ones.
[00:01:11.676 --> 00:01:13.639]  I mean, go up to Canada, take their oil.
[00:01:15.994 --> 00:01:16.455]  Look at these.
[00:01:16.475 --> 00:01:17.716]  These are half tracks.
[00:01:17.756 --> 00:01:27.046]  I don't care what you might want to call it an urban assault vehicle, but this country is becoming a police state, and it is very troubling to me.
[00:01:27.086 --> 00:01:36.036]  The excuse for the complete military takeover of Watertown, Massachusetts was the manhunt for a 19-year-old accused of committing a horrific crime.
[00:01:36.636 --> 00:01:48.568]  What normally would have been a police investigation quickly turned into the complete military occupation of an American city, conditioning us to believe that it's the government's job to keep us safe, even on the local level.
[00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:55.055]  We have been conditioned probably for 30 or 40 years, and you hear it all the time from the president, their job is to make us safe.
[00:01:55.455 --> 00:01:55.755]  I think so.
[00:02:10.452 --> 00:02:18.634]  The media praised the surveillance state as triumphant in catching the suspects, with some members of Congress promptly calling for even more government cameras.
[00:02:18.995 --> 00:02:32.639]  The sad fact, though, is that for all of the high-tech police state efforts applied, including adding one of the suspects to an FBI and CIA watch list after receiving intelligence from both Russia and Saudi Arabia,
[00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:36.580]  These efforts did absolutely nothing to catch the perpetrators.
[00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:44.421]  It was only after the shelter-in-place order was lifted that a private citizen was able to find the suspect hiding in his boat.
[00:02:44.961 --> 00:02:51.823]  Footage willingly submitted by private citizens near the finish line at the time of the bombing helped police identify the suspects.
[00:02:52.403 --> 00:02:59.084]  And it was, in fact, the surveillance footage of a private business that allegedly caught the suspects on camera.
[00:02:59.867 --> 00:03:00.568]  Now I get it.
[00:03:01.028 --> 00:03:01.809]  We were attacked.
[00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:07.474]  And I'm sure somewhere in our collective psyche, we needed that brute show of force to feel protected.
[00:03:08.174 --> 00:03:15.040]  But the last time Big Daddy Gov promised to protect us from the bad guys, our country went to war for more than a decade.
[00:03:15.741 --> 00:03:23.367]  Now our new daddy is promising to protect us from lone wolves here on American soil, and I've got a hunch about how that war is going to be waged.
[00:03:24.028 --> 00:03:30.470]  But don't worry, Homeland Security only needed 750 million bullets for target practice.
