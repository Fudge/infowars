[00:00:09.252 --> 00:00:16.357]  While the NSA is busy tapping your phones and the IRS swims in scandal, Congress screams immigration reform.
[00:00:16.877 --> 00:00:21.140]  Here's a huge example of how the bureaucracy has run our country into the ground.
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:27.564]  To the north, we have ships sitting in seaports overnight waiting to be cleared because of so-called changed policy.
[00:00:28.104 --> 00:00:31.626]  That keeps ships from being inspected until regular business hours.
[00:00:32.207 --> 00:00:40.691]  And to the south, we have illegals crossing and not being stopped because of various reasons ranging from sequester to no more detention space.
[00:00:41.212 --> 00:00:43.633]  Or the latest, running out of gas.
[00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:48.076]  Officials in South Texas are overwhelmed with illegal immigration issues.
[00:00:48.576 --> 00:00:56.019]  With borders essentially open and little enforcement on illegal immigration apprehension, how does an immigration bill get pushed through?
[00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:58.100]  With many amendments.
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:09.304]  Senator Ted Cruz tweets, I'll file amendment to immigration bill that permits states to require ID before registering voters and close this hole in Fed statutory law.
[00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:23.035]  Senator Rand Paul has introduced an amendment called Trust but Verify that would give the Congress power to vote and require the DHS to deliver on border security promises, including border fence and an identification system.
[00:01:23.855 --> 00:01:31.719]  The Paul outline also states if the border is not secure, then the processing of undocumented immigrants stops until it is secure.
[00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:39.762]  Securing the border and the vote is vital, and getting the DHS out of 7-Elevens and onto the border makes more sense.
[00:01:40.868 --> 00:01:45.891]  The DHS has enough money to run their outlandish urban warfare drills in the middle of Los Angeles.
[00:01:46.452 --> 00:01:49.974]  Why not take their Hollywood acting to live action on the border?
[00:01:50.895 --> 00:01:56.259]  The new DVD, State of Mind, exposes the technology behind mass mind control.
[00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:05.385]  For a limited time, when you order it on DVD or Blu-ray at InfoWarsStore.com, get the animated film, The American Dream, for free!
