[00:00:11.138 --> 00:00:12.139]  What brings you out here today?
[00:00:12.159 --> 00:00:13.960]  I'm trying out for America.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.241]  I was trying something new.
[00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:19.443]  My daughter has a natural ability.
[00:00:19.883 --> 00:00:22.725]  This guy got up and when I saw him perform, I literally laughed.
[00:00:23.686 --> 00:00:25.967]  And I thought... Is that a little rude in your opinion?
[00:00:26.307 --> 00:00:26.828]  Probably.
[00:00:27.068 --> 00:00:31.250]  How do you feel about Edward Snowden, the whistleblower who told us about all the NSA stuff?
[00:00:35.713 --> 00:00:40.056]  Since we're on the topic of singing, we know the Syrian rebels, which were funded by the Obama administration,
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.202]  They sing songs praising Al-Qaeda and Osama Bin Laden.
[00:00:43.242 --> 00:00:44.903]  They've pledged allegiance to Al-Qaeda.
[00:00:44.923 --> 00:00:47.625]  They sing songs about Osama Bin Laden, positive songs.
[00:00:47.965 --> 00:00:48.786]  How do you feel about that?
[00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:49.766]  Is this true?
[00:00:50.467 --> 00:01:07.079]  So it's like we're funding our own enemy.
[00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:09.580]  I most definitely have a problem with that.
[00:01:10.706 --> 00:01:11.427]  Wouldn't anybody?
[00:01:11.447 --> 00:01:13.229]  I do.
[00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.971]  Favorite pop artist, who would it be?
[00:01:15.592 --> 00:01:19.076]  I'll say somewhere between Queen, Alicia Keys.
[00:01:19.256 --> 00:01:20.297]  Now what song did you sing?
[00:01:20.718 --> 00:01:23.821]  I sung a song by Stevie Wonder called Signed, Sealed, Delivered.
[00:01:24.202 --> 00:01:25.443]  Let me ask you about Stevie Wonder.
[00:01:25.483 --> 00:01:29.628]  He recently said he would never perform in Florida again until they get rid of the Stand Your Ground law.
[00:01:33.444 --> 00:01:37.887]  The Stand Your Ground law is abolished in Florida.
[00:01:38.007 --> 00:01:39.548]  I will never perform there again.
[00:01:39.908 --> 00:01:43.211]  I believe, I agree with whatever he agrees with for himself.
[00:01:43.611 --> 00:01:50.075]  Me personally, you know, now times have changed, so I would probably, I would still perform there.
[00:01:50.396 --> 00:01:58.621]  The Department of Justice, who, you know, gave guns to Mexican cartels during Fast and Furious, they want to control iTunes, which means they could potentially control your music.
[00:01:58.721 --> 00:01:59.562]  How do you feel about that?
[00:02:00.502 --> 00:02:02.244]  There's already so many people controlling music, right?
[00:02:03.197 --> 00:02:05.339]  Oh wow, that doesn't sound too good.
[00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:07.140]  So I vote against that.
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.844]  I always want to get things legally, obviously, but I just feel like there shouldn't be any control over it.
[00:02:12.864 --> 00:02:17.928]  How do you feel about Bradley Manning, the whistleblower who was in the Army, and he's facing some serious jail time.
[00:02:17.948 --> 00:02:18.628]  What do you feel about that?
[00:02:18.648 --> 00:02:20.890]  I don't really follow that, so I don't know.
[00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.311]  Let me just ask you one final question about performances.
[00:02:23.351 --> 00:02:26.854]  We've seen the Super Bowl performances, the Beyonces, the Madonnas.
[00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.912]  You know, a lot of people saying there's some hidden agenda in these.
[00:02:30.292 --> 00:02:30.992]  Do you see any of that?
[00:02:31.292 --> 00:02:37.856]  Artists do take from what's going on and brings it to the stage or brings it to their life or their music.
[00:02:37.916 --> 00:02:39.237]  So, to be current.
[00:02:39.637 --> 00:02:45.921]  Stop by the Info Wars shop and pick up a copy of Professor Griff's The Psychological Covert War on Hip Hop.
