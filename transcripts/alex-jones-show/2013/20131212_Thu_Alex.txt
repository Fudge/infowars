[00:00:06.348 --> 00:00:06.968]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:08.669]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:10.530]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:11.171 --> 00:00:11.991]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.771 --> 00:00:13.652]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.312 --> 00:00:17.954]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.495 --> 00:00:22.557]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.957 --> 00:00:44.443]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live Thursday edition, the 12th day of December 2013.
[00:00:46.145 --> 00:00:56.333]  Former congressman and omnibudsman of the worldwide liberty movement, Dr. Ron Paul, will be joining us coming up at the start of the third hour.
[00:00:56.353 --> 00:00:58.095]  But other than that, we're going to have open phones.
[00:00:59.906 --> 00:01:03.067]  And we're going to cover a lot of news, and believe me, there is a ton of it.
[00:01:03.507 --> 00:01:29.257]  This Obamacare thing is just getting crazier by the minute, where they are canceling charity ads for good messages on MSNBC, on channels like ESPN, but then running Obamacare ads, telling people to go sign up at the site when Consumer Reports and others are saying, do not go sign up there.
[00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:33.752]  And it's all the hoax that it exists.
[00:01:33.852 --> 00:01:35.792]  It's designed to be a fraud.
[00:01:36.393 --> 00:01:39.213]  And there have been huge new developments on this front we're going to cover after the break.
[00:01:39.673 --> 00:01:45.575]  Also, the health director who approved Obama's birth certificate has died in a plane crash.
[00:01:46.756 --> 00:01:47.716]  You heard me right on that.
[00:01:48.576 --> 00:01:54.518]  The health director who approved Obama's birth certificate dies in a plane crash.
[00:01:56.241 --> 00:01:59.384]  And that's the lady that approved it and released it.
[00:02:00.505 --> 00:02:08.571]  And of course you know it was obviously a fake on purpose, just like the website's meant to be a complete fake and not work and be a total fraud.
[00:02:09.372 --> 00:02:13.135]  And then you have all these people that think they signed up, months later found out they didn't.
[00:02:14.516 --> 00:02:15.957]  People that mailed in the paper.
[00:02:17.258 --> 00:02:19.300]  Enrollments, learned they haven't signed up.
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.462]  They selectively will take a few people on the news,
[00:02:23.433 --> 00:02:25.814]  And take them and show them enrolled.
[00:02:26.935 --> 00:02:28.555]  It's like, well, somebody won the lottery.
[00:02:28.615 --> 00:02:32.557]  Somebody, I promise, saw a leprechaun one time, you know, in Ireland.
[00:02:32.597 --> 00:02:33.538]  They walked over a hill.
[00:02:33.578 --> 00:02:34.198]  It was a rainbow.
[00:02:34.218 --> 00:02:39.540]  There was a Lucky Charms guy, a bucket of gold there, dancing around happily in the mist.
[00:02:40.341 --> 00:02:42.042]  Maybe unicorns exist.
[00:02:42.122 --> 00:02:44.663]  Maybe Lucky Charms is real.
[00:02:45.083 --> 00:02:45.883]  I mean, who knows?
[00:02:46.304 --> 00:02:46.904]  Who knows?
[00:02:47.784 --> 00:02:49.105]  Maybe chupacabras are real.
[00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.161]  Maybe Obamacare is a good, good deal.
[00:02:53.201 --> 00:03:08.984]  Of course, now the architects of it admit it was just meant to bankrupt the system and bring in a single payer, and good old helpful Colin Powell, same guy that told us about Anthrax trucks, of course was lying on purpose, he says it's a great idea and gave an anecdotal story.
[00:03:09.044 --> 00:03:16.426]  So, you can see Boner and Powell and Rove and the Republican leadership
[00:03:17.452 --> 00:03:30.147]  The old blue blood globalists, they're ramming through the total takeover system and making sure that the real Tea Party is unable to try to save the country.
[00:03:31.684 --> 00:03:49.297]  And anyone that exposes that the United States is turning into a communist dictatorship, run by offshore interests that are extracting our wealth, corporate outside interest, financed the Bolshevik takeover, and for 70 plus years, extracted the wealth, working with the high-level communist party heads.
[00:03:49.318 --> 00:03:52.860]  That's all on record now, in congressional testimony, best-selling books.
[00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.901]  It's all come out.
[00:03:55.222 --> 00:03:56.283]  Putin talks about it.
[00:03:56.303 --> 00:03:58.304]  I mean, it is an open secret.
[00:03:59.245 --> 00:03:59.986]  And now,
[00:04:01.223 --> 00:04:04.184]  They're moving that model here, where they shut everything down.
[00:04:04.865 --> 00:04:07.326]  Only multinational combines are allowed to operate.
[00:04:10.287 --> 00:04:15.229]  And it is a emergency situation on every single front.
[00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:16.690]  So we're going to be breaking all that down.
[00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.911]  Also, DPS officer resigns after found to be an illegal immigrant.
[00:04:20.351 --> 00:04:21.052]  That's in Arizona.
[00:04:21.612 --> 00:04:30.636]  I actually saw ads in Arizona and New Mexico, we covered a few years ago, where they actually want to hire illegals as sheriff's deputies and have been doing so.
[00:04:32.162 --> 00:04:36.383]  You know, illegals get higher state tuition in most states than even U.S.
[00:04:36.403 --> 00:04:37.984]  citizens do if you're not from that state.
[00:04:38.004 --> 00:04:40.925]  I mean, I would get more benefits if I was an illegal alien.
[00:04:42.466 --> 00:04:44.386]  And again, I'm not even demonizing these poor illegal aliens.
[00:04:44.406 --> 00:04:53.709]  They're just being brought in and given preferential treatment so they'll work for lower wages to supplement their wages and then destroy the middle class.
[00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.031]  Just like Obamacare makes everybody go to part-time, basically.
[00:04:57.211 --> 00:04:57.911]  It's all the same deal.
[00:05:01.582 --> 00:05:04.326]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[00:05:04.607 --> 00:05:09.434]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[00:05:09.615 --> 00:05:16.806]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[00:05:16.926 --> 00:05:22.331]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[00:05:22.551 --> 00:05:26.154]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[00:05:26.575 --> 00:05:31.119]  You've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:36.524]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[00:05:36.744 --> 00:05:39.845]  Strategic Relocation 3rd Edition by Joel Skalzin.
[00:05:40.005 --> 00:05:42.226]  When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.
[00:05:42.506 --> 00:05:47.048]  Therosafe used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[00:05:47.248 --> 00:05:49.709]  Hand-cranked shortwave AM FM radios.
[00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:57.152]  Everything that we've researched and found to be the best is available at InfoWarshop.com and your purchase makes our InfoWar possible.
[00:05:57.352 --> 00:05:58.393]  We're getting prepared.
[00:05:58.613 --> 00:05:59.034]  Are you?
[00:05:59.294 --> 00:06:01.096]  Infowarsshop.com.
[00:06:01.557 --> 00:06:03.199]  Introducing Pro-1.
[00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:06.963]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on the go.
[00:06:07.103 --> 00:06:11.648]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[00:06:11.688 --> 00:06:12.329]  You have a system
[00:06:12.329 --> 00:06:15.950]  It is the only one that does it, and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:19.892]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides.
[00:06:40.959 --> 00:06:52.210]  Herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands, and sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:06:52.531 --> 00:06:57.836]  Get your Pro-Pure with the new Pro-1 filters today at Infowarsstore.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:02.301]  The facts are in.
[00:07:02.461 --> 00:07:03.602]  The studies are legion.
[00:07:03.863 --> 00:07:11.250]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:14.854]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[00:07:15.214 --> 00:07:15.614]  Simple.
[00:07:15.794 --> 00:07:20.159]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[00:07:20.499 --> 00:07:25.960]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:31.562]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield Formulation.
[00:07:31.762 --> 00:07:42.264]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[00:07:42.545 --> 00:07:44.365]  Let's take a stand against the globalist.
[00:07:44.505 --> 00:07:46.786]  By blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.
[00:07:47.106 --> 00:07:48.967]  I use Fluoride Shield every day.
[00:07:49.267 --> 00:07:54.569]  Secure your Fluoride Shield and other pioneering formulations at InfoWarsLife.com today.
[00:07:54.829 --> 00:07:59.070]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the Info War at the same time.
[00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:00.511]  That's InfoWarsLife.com
[00:08:23.664 --> 00:08:27.588]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:08:28.228 --> 00:08:32.092]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:32.112 --> 00:08:34.854]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:08:36.195 --> 00:08:39.298]  Rushing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:08:40.179 --> 00:08:45.904]  We are here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:08:45.984 --> 00:08:46.805]  until 2 p.m.
[00:08:46.885 --> 00:08:48.767]  Central Standard Time.
[00:08:49.963 --> 00:08:58.378]  Then we return with the InfoWars Nightly News, 7 o'clock Central Standard Time.
[00:08:59.488 --> 00:09:09.017]  Congressman, former Congressman, Dr. Ron Paul will be joining us with a lot of key intel on the economy, on Obama becoming a dictator at the start of the third hour.
[00:09:09.557 --> 00:09:13.721]  Two hours from now, roughly, a little less than two hours from now we'll have open phones.
[00:09:13.761 --> 00:09:20.567]  In the meantime, I want to give first-time callers a chance to call in first, then in the second hour I'll have a free-for-all.
[00:09:21.408 --> 00:09:34.500]  But on any of the news, I love the wild card aspect of it, on any topic you want to raise, on any news item you want to bring up, on any question you've got, agree with me, disagree with me, wide open phones, first time callers, 800-259-9231.
[00:09:40.016 --> 00:09:40.996]  800-259-9231.
[00:09:41.657 --> 00:09:51.180]  Now, here is just some of the news that is up on Infowars.com right now.
[00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:56.022]  Anti-Christian group forces Air Force to remove nativity scene.
[00:09:56.102 --> 00:09:58.142]  And that happened, of course, yesterday.
[00:09:58.983 --> 00:10:05.505]  But Curt Nemo's got an article breaking it down with a deeper analysis on the persecution
[00:10:07.025 --> 00:10:09.907]  ...of Christians, but everything else is allowed.
[00:10:10.448 --> 00:10:16.631]  Also, Obama nominates Israeli bankster as Federal Reserve Vice Chair.
[00:10:18.499 --> 00:10:20.080]  And, you know, I think that's an issue.
[00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:30.646]  We've got two articles by Nemo right there, because, you know, we should obviously have people that are Americans first and foremost, even if the Federal Reserve is a private entity running government policy.
[00:10:31.026 --> 00:10:39.391]  Also, Homeland Security employee who called for mass murder of whites finally has been fired.
[00:10:39.411 --> 00:10:45.615]  And also, America Dream, rest in peace, two-thirds of all Americans think the American Dream has died.
[00:10:46.363 --> 00:10:48.044]  A lot of them think capitalism did it.
[00:10:48.104 --> 00:10:48.904]  Well, it's the opposite.
[00:10:48.945 --> 00:10:50.345]  It's been rigged markets.
[00:10:50.806 --> 00:10:52.386]  The opposite of free market that have done this.
[00:10:52.807 --> 00:10:53.687]  Damage control.
[00:10:53.707 --> 00:11:02.392]  We're going to get into the article with the... Well, we're going to break that down.
[00:11:02.412 --> 00:11:04.513]  We actually get into that at that time.
[00:11:05.354 --> 00:11:10.117]  Also, we're going to get into Obama shipping in China produced poultry.
[00:11:11.277 --> 00:11:11.597]  Why not?
[00:11:11.617 --> 00:11:12.638]  They already get our fluoride.
[00:11:12.678 --> 00:11:17.522]  Most of the fluoride they put in our water comes from China with hundreds of other chemicals and toxins and heavy metals added to it.
[00:11:17.562 --> 00:11:17.943]  Why not?
[00:11:17.963 --> 00:11:18.683]  The sky's the limit.
[00:11:19.604 --> 00:11:26.270]  And also another story, a handful of constitutionally minded people in the Pentagon stopped the Syrian war.
[00:11:27.918 --> 00:11:34.381]  And that is a very important article because it breaks down the fact that that's been confirmed, but not many people are aware of it.
[00:11:34.401 --> 00:11:41.404]  There's actually good people in the Pentagon that put the brakes on that, thanks to public support as well.
[00:11:41.945 --> 00:11:46.227]  That's just some of the news up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:11:47.227 --> 00:11:50.048]  Let's go over some of the Obamacare news.
[00:11:50.088 --> 00:11:51.249]  Let's just go over these headlines.
[00:11:51.869 --> 00:11:52.630]  Obamacare.
[00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:56.252]  One of the greatest achievements in the nation's history.
[00:11:56.272 --> 00:11:59.734]  That's Representative Jan... How do you pronounce that?
[00:12:00.054 --> 00:12:01.094]  Schakowsky?
[00:12:02.495 --> 00:12:14.522]  And CNS News reports, never mind the naysayers, this representative from Illinois introduced positive reviews of Obamacare into the congressional record at Wednesday's congressional hearing.
[00:12:14.942 --> 00:12:19.645]  Then she addressed Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius personally.
[00:12:20.205 --> 00:12:37.510]  She said, I just want to say to you, Madam Secretary, I am absolutely confident that the role that you played in bringing affordable health care to millions, tens of millions of Americans, will go down in history as one of the greatest achievements of our country throughout the entire history.
[00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:39.671]  And I want to thank you for that.
[00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:51.106]  And I actually agree that this is one of the greatest achievements of absolute, open, manifest fraud.
[00:12:54.108 --> 00:12:55.469]  I absolutely agree with that.
[00:12:59.892 --> 00:13:02.814]  Because it is such a huge fraud.
[00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:05.301]  And it makes P.T.
[00:13:05.341 --> 00:13:06.843]  Barnum look like an honest person.
[00:13:06.903 --> 00:13:10.365]  It makes Pinocchio's nose look short.
[00:13:11.326 --> 00:13:16.430]  It's just unspeakable levels of fraud stacked on top of fraud.
[00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:17.471]  That's just one of the articles here.
[00:13:17.511 --> 00:13:19.513]  Let's move on to the next one over here.
[00:13:20.474 --> 00:13:26.699]  Issa, the congressman, charges Sebelius with criminal obstruction in Obamacare investigation.
[00:13:28.342 --> 00:13:30.703]  That is like charging the sun with coming up in the morning.
[00:13:31.143 --> 00:13:32.164]  Manifest lying.
[00:13:32.324 --> 00:13:33.284]  Manifest fraud.
[00:13:33.304 --> 00:13:35.165]  Designed to bankrupt the economy.
[00:13:35.205 --> 00:13:40.948]  This is a globalist, communist run operation to blow out our engine.
[00:13:42.267 --> 00:13:44.129]  Our financial engine and collapse the country.
[00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:48.154]  And when you look at Sebelius, you realize she knows exactly what she's doing.
[00:13:48.655 --> 00:13:56.824]  They are carrying out the destruction of this country to build their authoritarian utopia on its ashes.
[00:13:56.904 --> 00:13:58.446]  And they're doing a great job.
[00:13:59.627 --> 00:14:02.530]  Again, White House works to attract younger health plan users.
[00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:07.895]  That means young, dumb morons that they can feed into a meat grinder just like they do for the military.
[00:14:08.475 --> 00:14:12.619]  Sebelius says social media celebrities will help get the message out.
[00:14:12.639 --> 00:14:14.961]  They'll make it trendy to be ripped off.
[00:14:15.854 --> 00:14:23.361]  And they've actually been hiring Hollywood stars, music stars, to tell people to basically stick their hand in a garbage disposal.
[00:14:24.182 --> 00:14:38.295]  And if you put it out on MTV or in the culture, even intelligent people I've found just get mesmerized by it and by the glitz and by fame and just think it must be good because
[00:14:40.151 --> 00:14:42.034]  The Hollywood people are saying that.
[00:14:42.054 --> 00:14:43.116]  I'm going to get to that here in a moment.
[00:14:43.136 --> 00:14:44.077]  In fact, here it is.
[00:14:44.959 --> 00:14:50.528]  Sexiest man alive brought in to boost Obamacare enrollment.
[00:14:51.872 --> 00:14:57.816]  That's right, Drudge Report has a photo of the individual who they say is the sexiest man alive.
[00:14:57.876 --> 00:14:59.257]  I can't really comment.
[00:14:59.277 --> 00:15:01.158]  He looks pretty stupid to me, sticking his tongue out.
[00:15:01.218 --> 00:15:03.800]  He's kind of like a twerp, but what do I know?
[00:15:05.001 --> 00:15:09.344]  And this guy's name is Adam Levine or Levine?
[00:15:09.464 --> 00:15:11.986]  I don't even know who Adam Levine is.
[00:15:12.006 --> 00:15:12.486]  I'll show you.
[00:15:13.967 --> 00:15:14.808]  The singer of Maroon 5.
[00:15:15.048 --> 00:15:16.309]  I do know
[00:15:17.754 --> 00:15:20.495]  About how the world actually works.
[00:15:21.616 --> 00:15:29.000]  Of course, what people are supposed to do is obsess all day over the celebrities and how to look trendy.
[00:15:30.461 --> 00:15:44.211]  And then, to a certain extent, women then think if they find a trendy man that will make them successful, but the whole trendiness is actually there to show a few examples that are successful by being trendy, but then everyone else just basically buys into that so that you're unsuccessful.
[00:15:44.752 --> 00:15:50.476]  And it's all a paradigm to keep you out of the real world, out of discovering the real world, and to keep you in the matrix.
[00:15:50.536 --> 00:15:51.737]  So, there you go.
[00:15:52.858 --> 00:15:59.503]  The Obama administration is bringing in the sexiest man alive to help boost Obamacare enrollment numbers.
[00:16:00.879 --> 00:16:06.743]  Well, you know, they say the greatest advertisement ever was Bill Hicks is just a sexy woman, you know, showing you a can of beer or a can of Coke.
[00:16:07.563 --> 00:16:09.085]  That's the only look at the beer commercials of the show.
[00:16:09.105 --> 00:16:14.288]  A bunch of beautiful women on the beach running around, just having the best time of their lives.
[00:16:14.828 --> 00:16:16.530]  And they're drinking a cold beer.
[00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:18.971]  And the guy's got a cold beer.
[00:16:19.491 --> 00:16:19.912]  Doesn't matter.
[00:16:19.932 --> 00:16:21.293]  He's got a body by Budweiser.
[00:16:22.173 --> 00:16:22.594]  Giant.
[00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:26.032]  Porcine pot belly bigger than a hippopotamus's.
[00:16:26.732 --> 00:16:29.435]  That doesn't matter because he's got the beer.
[00:16:29.455 --> 00:16:33.578]  Of course, the women actually aren't really attracted to him and he's all alone drinking the beer.
[00:16:34.058 --> 00:16:34.619]  That doesn't matter.
[00:16:34.659 --> 00:16:43.766]  He still just thinks if he drinks more beer that the 15 Swedish bikini team models will rappel down on rubs from helicopters.
[00:16:44.705 --> 00:16:49.430]  And if you buy into the whole rap culture, the whole deal, you're going to be successful.
[00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:51.252]  All of you are going to be in the NFL.
[00:16:51.632 --> 00:16:52.994]  All of you are going to be in the NBA.
[00:16:53.394 --> 00:16:57.518]  All of you are going to be the top golfers.
[00:16:57.739 --> 00:17:01.262]  All of you are going to be stars, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:02.043 --> 00:17:14.108]  When you already can look up at the stars at night and you are a star made by the creator of the universe, with all this incredible adventure going on around you, people look down at the dirt and obsess over celebrity.
[00:17:14.388 --> 00:17:15.349]  And I know a lot of celebrities.
[00:17:15.369 --> 00:17:17.470]  Some of them are really interesting, really smart, really neat people.
[00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:18.170]  It's fun to know them.
[00:17:18.370 --> 00:17:19.831]  You can admire the music they play.
[00:17:20.491 --> 00:17:28.674]  But when you get into the whole culture being that, and not the bedrock of liberty, then your society degenerates.
[00:17:28.694 --> 00:17:30.015]  And that's a historical cycle.
[00:17:30.814 --> 00:17:31.335]  But it's okay.
[00:17:31.395 --> 00:17:37.340]  Obama has the sexiest man alive, they say, to help push it.
[00:17:39.142 --> 00:17:42.225]  And the goal that he's going to have pushing it is 100 million
[00:17:43.911 --> 00:17:44.992]  Internet contacts.
[00:17:45.092 --> 00:17:46.633]  And that's put out by the White House.
[00:17:46.933 --> 00:17:53.257]  They want your data when you go over and over again trying to get your free health care.
[00:17:53.497 --> 00:17:54.218]  They want your data.
[00:17:54.238 --> 00:18:02.163]  They want to track and know who doesn't have health care so they can grab your paycheck, garnish your wages, grab your tax refund, and grab your bank account.
[00:18:02.203 --> 00:18:03.044]  And that's now been admitted.
[00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:12.954]  And it's kind of like a soda machine, where you put in your dollar, and then it doesn't give you a drink, but you're really thirsty, so you keep sticking dollars in.
[00:18:13.234 --> 00:18:21.457]  By the third or fourth try, not getting the bottled water, the Gatorade, the Coca-Cola out, have you figured out that it's broken or it's a scam?
[00:18:22.239 --> 00:18:23.040]  No, no, no, no.
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:33.371]  If you have the sexiest man alive or the NFL promoting Obamacare and you've got a bunch of bombshell beauties promoting it, then it must be okay.
[00:18:33.391 --> 00:18:37.836]  So, it doesn't matter it's all a fraud by design to bankrupt the country.
[00:18:38.597 --> 00:18:43.503]  Just, just, just, just have Hollywood promote it and they admit they're targeting young people.
[00:18:44.465 --> 00:18:45.425]  They think you're dumb.
[00:18:46.186 --> 00:18:48.206]  You haven't been figured out it's a screw job yet.
[00:18:48.886 --> 00:18:49.947]  This is so predatory.
[00:18:49.967 --> 00:18:58.289]  They even admit they're targeting you in a criminal operation and they think you're so broke back that they can get away with anything.
[00:18:59.469 --> 00:19:00.630]  People ask, what's the limit?
[00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:01.010]  The sky.
[00:19:02.042 --> 00:19:06.565]  The sky is the limit, because these trendies will never admit Obama conned them.
[00:19:07.106 --> 00:19:07.486]  Ever!
[00:19:07.886 --> 00:19:09.568]  Their identity is in it.
[00:19:09.788 --> 00:19:19.575]  And so it isn't even Obama who's running things, but his idea, his front, his figurehead, is the universal projection of the deception.
[00:19:21.059 --> 00:19:26.485]  Oh, HHS awards another 58 million for Obamacare navigators to known criminal groups.
[00:19:26.565 --> 00:19:27.726]  The Weekly Standard reports.
[00:19:27.786 --> 00:19:28.307]  Isn't that nice?
[00:19:28.327 --> 00:19:32.371]  To go out and literally get all your personal data basically threatening you at your door.
[00:19:34.881 --> 00:19:44.724]  So that's just some of the news on that front, and taxpayers shell out $14,000 per Obamacare enrollee for the cost of each enrollee that's actually been able to sign up for it.
[00:19:45.345 --> 00:19:49.826]  Obamacare raised the cost of your kids' braces, and when we come back, it gets better.
[00:19:49.846 --> 00:19:56.688]  Obamacare advertises on ESPN with taxpayer money, but ESPN drops Christmas ad for referring to God and Jesus.
[00:19:57.389 --> 00:20:00.150]  And the lady that brought out the fake birth certificate, she's dead.
[00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:00.770]  Plane crash.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.101]  Alex Jones here, and I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show, My Patriot Supply.
[00:20:07.461 --> 00:20:15.923]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[00:20:16.363 --> 00:20:23.644]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow Patriots.

[00:21:11.224 --> 00:21:17.627]  Listen, there is some real scum in the alarm business cashing in by locking you into long, punishing contracts.
[00:21:18.027 --> 00:21:19.968]  Not with SimpliSafe Home Security.

[00:22:00.915 --> 00:22:07.159]  According to the FBI, close to 400,000 burglaries take place in the United States between November and December each year.
[00:22:07.359 --> 00:22:10.501]  Seems burglars shop for the holidays too, for easy targets.
[00:22:10.821 --> 00:22:13.923]  Here are a few things that you can do to lower the risk of a break-in.
[00:22:14.203 --> 00:22:15.204]  Lock doors and windows.
[00:22:15.404 --> 00:22:17.926]  Don't have newspapers and mail accumulate in front of your house.
[00:22:18.166 --> 00:22:22.110]  Don't announce your travel plans on social media and plug in fake TV.
[00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:23.491]  Burglars love the dark.
[00:22:23.691 --> 00:22:27.054]  Fake TV is a bit like a light on a timer but more convincing.
[00:22:27.234 --> 00:22:31.237]  Plugs into any outlet and simulates the colors and movement of a real TV.
[00:22:31.478 --> 00:22:34.881]  Burglars will see light and movement and likely move on to easier targets.
[00:22:35.121 --> 00:22:39.925]  Fake TV costs less than a month of most alarm monitoring plans and makes a great Christmas gift.
[00:22:40.285 --> 00:22:43.086]  Or it's perfect if you're traveling over the holidays or anytime.

[00:24:19.266 --> 00:24:27.891]  For those of us that by the grace of God are not in a trance, doesn't mean we're not influenceable, doesn't mean we don't make mistakes, doesn't mean we're perfect.
[00:24:28.451 --> 00:24:42.118]  But for those of us that are actually conscious and awake, it's comical, it's painful, it's disgusting, it's nauseating, it's infuriating, it's mind-boggling to watch people conned by the hype-driven system.
[00:24:43.339 --> 00:24:44.479]  And look, I don't blame people.
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:46.981]  I remember when I was a child,
[00:24:48.699 --> 00:25:00.992]  My dad taking me to movies like The Running Man and stuff when I was like 12 years old and thinking Arnold Schwarzenegger was just the most manly, awesome, cool guy in the world.
[00:25:01.052 --> 00:25:01.913]  And that is a good movie.
[00:25:02.153 --> 00:25:04.596]  Great Stephen King screenplay and book.
[00:25:04.896 --> 00:25:05.356]  Short story.
[00:25:07.138 --> 00:25:11.463]  Now that I know who Arnold Schwarzenegger really is as an adult, he's a horrible, abusive monster.
[00:25:12.739 --> 00:25:25.793]  And it's the same thing, but now because I've actually had a chance to get to know a lot of celebrities, I know most of them are vapid, empty, unhappy people, themselves obsessed with other celebrities, just like a child.
[00:25:27.174 --> 00:25:33.241]  But then many of them actually know it's all a big fraud and a prison, and they want to change their name and get out of it, or fake their death.
[00:25:34.343 --> 00:25:46.088]  And the reason I talk about this so much is that it is celebrity, the celebrity of Obama, the celebrity of Obamacare and who's pushing it, the celebrity of Oprah Winfrey.
[00:25:49.915 --> 00:25:52.437]  To sell a lie.
[00:25:52.517 --> 00:25:56.480]  When Oprah Winfrey probably has about 170 IQ.
[00:25:57.461 --> 00:25:59.983]  She's a genius of manipulation and deception.
[00:26:00.604 --> 00:26:04.287]  She's part of eugenics secret meetings that have leaked, confirmed.
[00:26:04.687 --> 00:26:10.432]  She's part of running bizarre cult takeovers of Africa and churches that she uses as fronts.
[00:26:11.933 --> 00:26:16.857]  I mean, she's one of the only people they let into meetings where there's only 10 top globalists they let Oprah Winfrey in.
[00:26:18.658 --> 00:26:19.399]  Just to give you an idea.
[00:26:21.926 --> 00:26:29.693]  And this is a woman selling racialist, race-pimping division and trying to sell her people out and trying to depopulate Africa.
[00:26:30.193 --> 00:26:32.015]  I mean, that's why she's been brought up to that level.
[00:26:32.175 --> 00:26:33.876]  She's very intelligent, but she's very evil.
[00:26:34.336 --> 00:26:39.621]  And she sits there and fake cries, just like Obama and everybody else, to her audience of people she's abusing.
[00:26:40.041 --> 00:26:45.286]  And that makes me not even hate her, it makes me realize this is El Diablo.
[00:26:46.581 --> 00:26:53.287]  You get really smart, talented people who choose to be parasites so she can be worth, you know, $10 million or whatever it is.
[00:26:53.887 --> 00:26:54.608]  It's disgusting!
[00:26:56.690 --> 00:27:06.278]  It's truly sick how she sits there and beams that she's a real person and really cares about people, but when you actually study her, she's a cold-blooded operator.
[00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:09.021]  Just like Obama.
[00:27:09.881 --> 00:27:13.525]  These people, you turn your back on them, they will stick it in.
[00:27:14.878 --> 00:27:21.303]  It will stick a knife right between your political, cultural, and spiritual ribs, right into your heart.
[00:27:21.784 --> 00:27:31.672]  And it's just once you know this, the trance is broken, the haze is broken, and you realize, my gosh, these people are literally abusing me.
[00:27:31.692 --> 00:27:34.635]  I think everybody should go see the film, The Face in the Crowd.
[00:27:34.675 --> 00:27:36.036]  I want to get that clip at the end.
[00:27:36.656 --> 00:27:42.962]  Or maybe do a movie review for the Nightly News, showing the progression of the film, reviewing it, and then showing the end scene.
[00:27:44.498 --> 00:27:48.361]  Uh, where the Oprah Winfrey type character, but he's a white guy played by Andy Griffith.
[00:27:51.143 --> 00:27:55.806]  And he doesn't know he's live on air still talking about what idiots his viewers are.
[00:27:56.286 --> 00:27:57.487]  And I remember seeing that as a kid.
[00:27:59.204 --> 00:28:01.686]  On television one night when my dad was out of town, me and my mom watching.
[00:28:01.706 --> 00:28:03.067]  I'll never forget, I was probably about eight years old.
[00:28:03.768 --> 00:28:05.769]  I thought nobody'd actually really be like that.
[00:28:06.189 --> 00:28:11.914]  And now I realize with these globalist folks, that's the norm, not the exception.
[00:28:12.254 --> 00:28:19.300]  They don't get off on building good products, writing good books, having good culture, teaching people things, building people up.
[00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:22.142]  I mean, I enjoy teaching people things.
[00:28:22.282 --> 00:28:26.565]  I enjoy helping other talk show hosts that aren't as successful as I am, who are good people.
[00:28:27.085 --> 00:28:29.727]  I enjoy trying to lift up other news organizations.
[00:28:30.488 --> 00:28:32.409]  I enjoy seeing people do well.
[00:28:33.730 --> 00:28:40.215]  I think it's neat when somebody is worth billions of dollars on their own initiative and they bring something to humanity.
[00:28:40.295 --> 00:28:41.116]  I admire the Swiss.
[00:28:44.056 --> 00:28:48.158]  You could have a billion dollars, and they don't just want a billion dollars brought to Switzerland.
[00:28:48.758 --> 00:29:03.685]  If you've got a patent on something for construction or something for electronics, and you'll just come to Switzerland because you've invented something and you've done something, you don't have to even bring money, then they'll have you into the country.
[00:29:04.676 --> 00:29:05.977]  I mean, that's the type of culture.
[00:29:05.997 --> 00:29:07.177]  I was thinking about that last night.
[00:29:07.938 --> 00:29:09.739]  That's the type of culture I want to live in.
[00:29:10.079 --> 00:29:16.063]  Not where you come here and we give you free welfare so you'll vote to enslave those of us that produce.
[00:29:19.164 --> 00:29:20.765]  And that's really what this comes down to.
[00:29:20.785 --> 00:29:22.006]  I mean, what do you bring to the table?
[00:29:22.046 --> 00:29:23.547]  What do you contribute to society?
[00:29:24.127 --> 00:29:25.548]  To make it a richer society?
[00:29:26.849 --> 00:29:29.050]  I like to see culture rise.
[00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:30.571]  I just admire beauty.
[00:29:32.691 --> 00:29:35.714]  I don't get mad at some guy when he's got a girlfriend who looks like Marilyn Monroe.
[00:29:36.635 --> 00:29:37.496]  I admire them.
[00:29:38.256 --> 00:29:41.379]  And just think, man, they must really love each other.
[00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:44.362]  But most guys I know get violently angry.
[00:29:44.803 --> 00:29:46.024]  So I guess I'm just a weirdo.
[00:29:47.105 --> 00:29:49.207]  We're gonna come back and get into the Obamacare death.
[00:29:49.827 --> 00:29:50.208]  Stay with us.
[00:29:50.968 --> 00:29:51.889]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.370 --> 00:29:53.971]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.892 --> 00:29:57.595]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.168 --> 00:30:07.269]  Alex Jones here, and I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show, My Patriot Supply.
[00:30:07.629 --> 00:30:16.112]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[00:30:16.532 --> 00:30:23.834]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow Patriots.
[00:30:24.354 --> 00:30:31.756]  My Patriot Supply brings us their exclusive Patriot Pantry brand, along with many other fine preparedness products.
[00:30:32.256 --> 00:30:35.659]  I personally store and use their high-quality products.
[00:30:36.199 --> 00:30:39.841]  It tastes great, and it's easy to store for up to 25 years.

[00:31:01.778 --> 00:31:06.340]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:09.481]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[00:31:09.621 --> 00:31:14.842]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[00:31:15.182 --> 00:31:16.783]  It all comes down to one thing.
[00:31:17.103 --> 00:31:18.444]  We are what we eat.
[00:31:18.744 --> 00:31:23.087]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[00:31:23.407 --> 00:31:27.390]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[00:31:27.650 --> 00:31:29.972]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[00:31:30.192 --> 00:31:36.116]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[00:32:12.051 --> 00:32:18.036]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilic acid.

[00:32:50.549 --> 00:32:52.591]  And sodium hexafluorosilicate.

[00:33:24.183 --> 00:33:28.909]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:41.172 --> 00:33:42.612]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:42.652 --> 00:33:44.733]  Gonna go to your phone calls here in just a few minutes.
[00:33:45.773 --> 00:33:47.413]  And we'll continue with news in the next hour.
[00:33:47.513 --> 00:33:53.775]  But, health director who approved Obama's birth certificate dies in a plane crash.
[00:33:54.715 --> 00:33:55.715]  And this is out of U.S.
[00:33:55.775 --> 00:33:56.756]  News and World Report.
[00:33:56.776 --> 00:33:58.856]  It's also in NBC News reporting on it.
[00:33:59.356 --> 00:34:02.517]  The health director who approved the release of President Obama's birth certificate
[00:34:03.357 --> 00:34:08.146]  ...has died in a plane crash, Hawaiian officials said last night.
[00:34:09.047 --> 00:34:13.095]  Or I guess this morning, actually, because it's Thursday right now, the 12th day of December 2013.
[00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:28.036]  Loretta Foddy, I guess you'd pronounce it, died after the Cessna Grand Caravan aircraft she was traveling on went down shortly after leaving the airport around 3.15 p.m.
[00:34:28.957 --> 00:34:29.697]  on Wednesday.
[00:34:29.717 --> 00:34:30.737]  So this news just came out.
[00:34:31.218 --> 00:34:33.579]  The other eight people on board were rescued.
[00:34:35.359 --> 00:34:42.723]  So who knows if it was foul play, but there was no indication as to why the plane had crashed.
[00:34:43.684 --> 00:34:50.547]  But I had said at the time, you can pull these videos up, right when they released the birth certificate a few years ago, it was clearly fake.
[00:34:50.647 --> 00:35:08.076]  I'm not saying she put out a fake, but someone may have made a fake inside the records and given it to her to release, that whoever was involved in this or whoever might blow the whistle inside later would be having a plane crash or getting mugged and falling down and hitting their head.
[00:35:08.196 --> 00:35:09.737]  So it's very, very suspicious.
[00:35:09.757 --> 00:35:12.318]  But of course, there won't be any investigation of that.
[00:35:13.286 --> 00:35:20.987]  Also, speaking of government-run health care, NHS never events revealed.
[00:35:21.867 --> 00:35:24.068]  That's never never events that they want to happen.
[00:35:24.348 --> 00:35:25.788]  That's the National Health Service in England.
[00:35:26.788 --> 00:35:31.769]  Surgeons carried out heart surgery on wrong patient, wrong toe removed, and wrong foot operated on.
[00:35:33.809 --> 00:35:42.411]  And it just goes over 148 never events, medical mistakes that according to the guidelines should never happen at NHS Trust between April and September this year.
[00:35:44.736 --> 00:35:48.661]  And it just goes into the nightmare scenarios that we're going to be living under here more and more.
[00:35:48.721 --> 00:35:53.446]  And again, I'm not saying that our current healthcare system is good.
[00:35:55.268 --> 00:35:56.289]  What I'm saying is...
[00:35:59.187 --> 00:36:04.490]  That it's government and corporate takeover of the healthcare system that's made it so expensive and so fraudulent.
[00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:05.430]  That's what the history shows.
[00:36:05.751 --> 00:36:20.859]  And now they're going to wreck it even worse to bring in total single payer that micromanages every facet of our lives with social control because we're now all communally tied to socialist healthcare but with the profits offshored in a fascist pipeline.
[00:36:21.599 --> 00:36:32.704]  So the very worst system that they could come up with, purely criminal, exploitive private corporate tax, with social engineering by private corporate eugenicist.
[00:36:33.124 --> 00:36:36.006]  You could not come up with something nastier than this.
[00:36:36.066 --> 00:36:41.789]  Now, Obamacare is now advertising, I guess for taxpayer money, on ESPN.
[00:36:42.549 --> 00:36:49.032]  And the big insurance companies are all lobbying to keep Obamacare in place as it is right now, because they wrote it.
[00:36:51.237 --> 00:36:58.121]  But I love how when I criticize Obamacare, I see comments and emails saying, you must work for, you know, the insurance companies.
[00:36:58.281 --> 00:36:59.042]  It's like, what?
[00:37:00.042 --> 00:37:01.643]  No connection to the insurance companies.
[00:37:01.663 --> 00:37:02.784]  Except I have insurance.
[00:37:03.244 --> 00:37:04.465]  Overpriced, I never used.
[00:37:04.765 --> 00:37:06.006]  It just went up, by the way, a bunch.
[00:37:06.026 --> 00:37:07.266]  I haven't even done a story on that yet.
[00:37:08.507 --> 00:37:13.670]  My insurance out of Minnesota, because I got it through Genesis, has only gone up really 50% or so.
[00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:15.791]  Though I guess I'm on the low end.
[00:37:15.812 --> 00:37:17.132]  So thank you, Obamacare.
[00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:22.057]  Won't get kicked off and I won't have my premiums raised.
[00:37:22.297 --> 00:37:22.959]  No one else will.
[00:37:22.979 --> 00:37:25.083]  It'll lower the price of a phone or cable bill.
[00:37:26.385 --> 00:37:28.566]  But here it is, Obamacare advertises on ESPN.
[00:37:28.966 --> 00:37:36.209]  Last night the 32nd advertisement ran to encourage folks to sign up at Health Insurance Marketplace, otherwise known as Obamacare.
[00:37:36.809 --> 00:37:42.011]  Now for the first time, you can be covered with a quality health plan from a new health insurance marketplace.
[00:37:42.411 --> 00:37:44.772]  Part of the health care law, says the mail announcer.
[00:37:45.672 --> 00:37:47.913]  Absolute total fraud, and it ran on ESPN.
[00:37:48.333 --> 00:37:51.074]  Perfect audience of sports morons.
[00:37:52.210 --> 00:37:54.172]  Men who don't want to spend time with their family.
[00:37:54.573 --> 00:37:56.695]  Men who don't want to spend time learning how the world really works.
[00:37:57.116 --> 00:38:01.241]  They want to go home at six, seven o'clock at night and watch five hours of sports.
[00:38:02.970 --> 00:38:03.050]  And
[00:38:23.121 --> 00:38:24.922]  Roman decline that we've become.
[00:38:25.462 --> 00:38:35.984]  So let's play the ad that's allowed to air, then we've got a clip of Fox News reporting on the very same ESPN drops Christmas ad because Christmas is offensive.
[00:38:36.024 --> 00:38:48.688]  The word Christmas is not allowed, but we will run an ad by a criminal government run by foreign banks and insurance companies to have people go sign up so they can be sent tax bills for not having Obamacare because they're not allowed to sign up for Obamacare.
[00:38:50.256 --> 00:39:00.419]  I mean that, that is beyond a Bizarro World futuristic novel by Heinlein or somebody like that.
[00:39:00.439 --> 00:39:05.681]  I mean this, this is just, if you wrote satire like this 30 years ago, no one would believe it.
[00:39:05.701 --> 00:39:13.063]  They would say it's too fantastical, absurdist, surrealist, and now I feel like I'm in a
[00:39:14.286 --> 00:39:17.408]  Living inside a cuckoo bird clock or something with the general public.
[00:39:17.688 --> 00:39:24.651]  Because I hear people at, you know, at the store or wherever or at the bank talking and they're like, I like Obama, right?
[00:39:24.791 --> 00:39:25.992]  I think the healthcare is going to be fine.
[00:39:26.012 --> 00:39:26.853]  They're going to fix it.
[00:39:27.253 --> 00:39:28.754]  I see the comments online and everything.
[00:39:29.214 --> 00:39:33.096]  And sure, it's maybe 30% of the public that's still literally
[00:39:35.626 --> 00:39:36.868]  Living in a false reality.
[00:39:37.028 --> 00:39:41.736]  But it's still just insane because it doesn't matter if Congress has a 6% approval rate.
[00:39:42.357 --> 00:39:44.781]  The system should set the precedent that this is what they're going to do.
[00:39:45.202 --> 00:39:46.343]  So I'm trying to figure out...
[00:39:47.608 --> 00:39:48.709]  How do they top this?
[00:39:49.350 --> 00:39:59.480]  Well, they're going to take the public and private pension funds to protect them, just like the models they've done in other countries hundreds of times, in different counties, cities, and regions around the world thousands of times.
[00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:05.986]  That's how they've done it in California and other areas, how they're doing it in Michigan, and it will come everywhere when they're done because it's designed to bankrupt us.
[00:40:06.006 --> 00:40:09.390]  No matter what we do, they've signed us on to systems that are unsustainable.
[00:40:10.606 --> 00:40:21.131]  They'll first have a deal and take 20% of the pension funds, public and private, here or there, to protect them, and then two years later, oh, it's unsolving again, insolving again, we gotta take another 30.
[00:40:21.291 --> 00:40:33.417]  And they're like, oh, a couple years later, you know what, we're gonna take 80% of what's left, that's what's happening in Detroit right now, or you're going to get nothing.
[00:40:34.707 --> 00:40:47.114]  And the average sheeple that are totally cowardly, totally scared, and most of them government workers that have been parasiting off people and running everybody out of the area anyways, in California or Michigan, they're going to say, okay, I'll take my 20%.
[00:40:49.055 --> 00:40:52.197]  And then down the road, they're going to take half of that, or 80%, until...
[00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:55.721]  You end up with nothing.
[00:40:55.821 --> 00:41:00.584]  And listen, you're not going to get Social Security within the next 5-10 years.
[00:41:00.604 --> 00:41:01.865]  It's the same thing worldwide.
[00:41:02.085 --> 00:41:04.387]  They're going to take your Social Security one bite at a time.
[00:41:04.667 --> 00:41:07.189]  They're going to take the stock market when the dollar devalues.
[00:41:07.429 --> 00:41:08.149]  It's all pumped up.
[00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:10.051]  And I'm not saying this to scare you folks.
[00:41:10.591 --> 00:41:14.594]  It's only going to get worse the longer you beg to be hurt by the New World Order.
[00:41:15.054 --> 00:41:17.415]  The longer you're gullible, the longer you go.
[00:41:18.115 --> 00:41:22.856]  Well, my favorite music star says in ads, I should sign up for Obamacare.
[00:41:22.896 --> 00:41:28.138]  So it's so trendy, I feel like I'm buying into it and I'm his friend or I'm her friend.
[00:41:28.758 --> 00:41:36.280]  You know, if, if, if, if Kyanne West, Kanye West, Joe Bieber or whatever, Joseph Bieber,
[00:41:38.097 --> 00:41:39.278]  What's that idiot kid's name?
[00:41:39.979 --> 00:41:40.859]  Justin Biebler.
[00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:43.281]  Bobler, Jobler, whatever his name is.
[00:41:44.202 --> 00:41:46.644]  They... If they say it, you do it!
[00:41:49.146 --> 00:41:49.566]  Excuse me.
[00:41:50.607 --> 00:41:55.751]  Let's go ahead, because I want to go to your phone calls, and get to Obamacare advertises on ESPN, but Christians?
[00:41:57.292 --> 00:41:58.053]  You see the door?
[00:41:58.754 --> 00:41:59.995]  You're offensive, Christians.
[00:42:00.215 --> 00:42:01.236]  You're nativity scene.
[00:42:01.616 --> 00:42:04.538]  Anti-Christian group forces, Air Force removed nativity scene.
[00:42:05.539 --> 00:42:07.601]  What you're doing is offensive.
[00:42:09.983 --> 00:42:11.223]  You're offensive to us.
[00:42:12.003 --> 00:42:13.584]  Your existence is bigoted.
[00:42:14.884 --> 00:42:21.066]  The name father and mother in government documents all over the country is being removed because it's offensive to be a father or a mother.
[00:42:21.446 --> 00:42:23.486]  It's offensive if you're a man and you like women.
[00:42:24.306 --> 00:42:27.167]  It's offensive if you're a woman and you like men.
[00:42:27.707 --> 00:42:31.048]  It's offensive if you like health and justice and family.
[00:42:31.248 --> 00:42:32.128]  It's offensive!
[00:42:32.728 --> 00:42:35.729]  You're being alive is offensive to the New World Order.
[00:42:37.042 --> 00:42:57.607]  So let's go ahead and go to the not offensive con artist ad, literally to suck people in to be mugged by the Obamacare fraud machine and his army of criminal navigators that we predicted with Kit Daniels four months ago, two months before this latest pile of you-know-what dropped into the Thunder Mug.
[00:42:57.627 --> 00:43:01.448]  That's what my great-grandfather called a toilet, a Thunder Mug.
[00:43:02.481 --> 00:43:06.842]  I tell you, the American people, Obama sees the American people as a giant thunder bug.
[00:43:06.862 --> 00:43:13.644]  And I'm telling you, if they had a trendy, tell people that it was chocolate raining on us, they'd run out.
[00:43:14.004 --> 00:43:19.065]  You could tell a trendy, and have Obama say, that stuff you see out in the grass at the park, that's chocolate.
[00:43:19.405 --> 00:43:23.906]  And I'm telling you, the average Obama supporter, I'm not even joking, would get down on the ground and start eating it.
[00:43:24.889 --> 00:43:33.751]  I'm telling you folks, if they had Kanye West, Tyanne West get out there and say get on the ground and eat dog crap, people would do it and I'm not joking.
[00:43:34.071 --> 00:43:37.792]  The Aztecs said it was trendy to take your child up and have their heart cut out and they did it.
[00:43:38.292 --> 00:43:39.073]  You think I'm joking?
[00:43:39.093 --> 00:43:39.673]  I'm not joking.
[00:43:39.953 --> 00:43:44.734]  Let's go ahead and go to the ad that's allowed on ESPN.
[00:43:47.985 --> 00:43:48.646]  Now I'm covered.
[00:43:49.767 --> 00:43:51.748]  Now for the first time, you can be covered.
[00:43:51.769 --> 00:43:55.071]  With a quality health plan from the new health insurance marketplace.
[00:43:55.332 --> 00:43:56.252]  Part of the health care law.
[00:43:56.573 --> 00:44:00.196]  It's where brand name companies offer plans you can compare side by side.
[00:44:00.576 --> 00:44:02.678]  And it's the place to get lower monthly payments.
[00:44:03.078 --> 00:44:03.619]  I'm covered.
[00:44:03.919 --> 00:44:04.640]  Oh, it's lower!
[00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:09.504]  So if you have an accident, get sick, or just need a checkup, I'm covered.
[00:44:10.405 --> 00:44:10.946]  We're covered.
[00:44:11.166 --> 00:44:12.086]  Now we're covered.
[00:44:12.127 --> 00:44:12.847]  Covered in BS.
[00:44:12.987 --> 00:44:16.330]  Enroll now at the health insurance marketplace at healthcare.gov.
[00:44:17.531 --> 00:44:17.691]  Awww.
[00:44:18.451 --> 00:44:19.492]  Isn't that sweet?
[00:44:20.373 --> 00:44:22.354]  Isn't that darling that they do that for us?
[00:44:24.076 --> 00:44:26.778]  By the way, you're going to get lower prices through Obamacare.
[00:44:27.158 --> 00:44:29.480]  On average they've doubled, set to quadruple in the next two years.
[00:44:30.933 --> 00:44:32.854]  Humana Plans in Texas.
[00:44:32.894 --> 00:44:35.816]  Mike Adams of NaturalNews.com got that document.
[00:44:36.616 --> 00:44:38.798]  A 500 and something percent increase.
[00:44:38.818 --> 00:44:39.738]  We can show the document.
[00:44:40.839 --> 00:44:43.360]  My dad's is doubled in like three installments.
[00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:45.201]  That's how they do it to most people.
[00:44:45.281 --> 00:44:47.583]  It goes up 25, 50 percent, 30 percent.
[00:44:47.603 --> 00:44:49.624]  It's just the way they take your pension fund.
[00:44:52.329 --> 00:44:58.372]  Let me tell you, they never start having tanks drive around and guys in black uniforms and training to take on gun owners to fight Al-Qaeda, folks.
[00:44:58.893 --> 00:45:02.575]  When the government starts doing that, it's like when criminals come into a bank and say, hands up.
[00:45:03.015 --> 00:45:08.638]  When the state starts arming against you and training against you, they're saying, you know, they're walking into a bank, hands up, folks!
[00:45:09.599 --> 00:45:11.000]  Alright, move in the operation!
[00:45:12.619 --> 00:45:16.001]  But before they did that, they culturally hit you with a culture bomb to dumb you down.
[00:45:16.321 --> 00:45:17.882]  Chemicals, biologicals, there it is.
[00:45:18.242 --> 00:45:23.786]  Rate shock, Obamacare causing 539% increase in health insurance costs for Texans.
[00:45:23.846 --> 00:45:30.590]  If you scroll down, right there in the article, he's actually got a copy of the document there in the story.
[00:45:31.851 --> 00:45:32.951]  So, there you go.
[00:45:33.051 --> 00:45:40.116]  And it actually says, you have the right to contact the Texas Department of Insurance regarding this notice.
[00:45:41.078 --> 00:45:46.342]  And then in there it says, your increase, percentage of change, in one month, 539.60.
[00:45:46.822 --> 00:45:50.644]  I'm sorry.
[00:45:50.925 --> 00:45:53.887]  Here, now, now, that's not offensive.
[00:45:53.987 --> 00:45:55.127]  This is what's offensive.
[00:45:55.508 --> 00:45:59.590]  ESPN drops Christmas ad for reference to God and Jesus.
[00:45:59.951 --> 00:46:01.252]  There's not a dirtier word.
[00:46:01.272 --> 00:46:04.634]  The FCC ought to add that to the seven deadly words you're not allowed to say.
[00:46:06.167 --> 00:46:08.729]  Actually, they say you're allowed to say that now on broadcast TV.
[00:46:08.769 --> 00:46:11.490]  It's only selectively enforced against broadcast radio.
[00:46:12.851 --> 00:46:30.943]  In his continuing effort to expose the secular left's war on Christmas, Fox News' Bill O'Reilly reported, what a good guy over there, I'm being sarcastic, on Rather, this heartening story about, I mean, O'Reilly does some good work, but he also goes, there's more and more sex abuse online than cuts to a picture of me ranting about Obama, but doesn't say it's Obama.
[00:46:32.301 --> 00:46:34.749]  And then it says stop the hate on screen.
[00:46:34.810 --> 00:46:38.101]  It's like... But anyways, O'Reilly got this right.
[00:46:40.219 --> 00:46:50.707]  Each Christmas, thousands in our community send messages of hope to sick and injured children who may not be able to come home for the holidays, said SSM's Cardinal Glennon Children's Medical Center.
[00:46:51.067 --> 00:46:58.012]  We celebrate the birth of Jesus, that's what Christmas is, and the season of giving, bringing hope to many children, parents and families we serve.
[00:46:58.873 --> 00:47:04.097]  Our patients are filled with hope as they receive a message each day from the treasure chest beneath our tree of hope.
[00:47:05.492 --> 00:47:09.333]  God forbid at a Catholic hospital they run an ad for helping sick kids.
[00:47:09.754 --> 00:47:11.614]  You're not allowed to have the Catholics run ads.
[00:47:12.935 --> 00:47:14.875]  Catholics are supposed to teach abortion at their churches.
[00:47:15.856 --> 00:47:19.997]  According to Obamacare, help us reveal God's healing presence this Christmas.
[00:47:20.378 --> 00:47:21.398]  Send your message of hope.
[00:47:23.055 --> 00:47:30.778]  And what they don't want is the medicine of love and God and remembering it's not about materialism, it's about helping sick children.
[00:47:31.258 --> 00:47:33.739]  I told my wife, it's Christmas time, I said, what are we doing for charity?
[00:47:33.759 --> 00:47:42.983]  We're going to give money to Salvation Army, we're going to give money to some good children's hospitals, we're going to give money to some other things, where you know 90 plus percent of it goes to what
[00:47:43.749 --> 00:47:46.551]  There's only a few charities you can really even trust out there.
[00:47:47.292 --> 00:47:47.932]  God forbid?
[00:47:48.032 --> 00:47:48.452]  No, no, no.
[00:47:48.833 --> 00:47:54.056]  We've got to have Bill Clinton run ads for Haitian kids where he keeps more than half of it for his private jet aircraft.
[00:47:56.998 --> 00:48:00.261]  Again, that's the kind of charity we can run.
[00:48:00.601 --> 00:48:06.085]  So let's go ahead and air this dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty banned ad from ESPN.
[00:48:06.125 --> 00:48:06.445]  Here it is.
[00:48:14.331 --> 00:48:16.745]  On ESPN, that said this.
[00:48:18.209 --> 00:48:25.455]  Each Christmas, thousands in our community send messages of hope to sick and injured children who may not be able to come home for the holidays.
[00:48:25.695 --> 00:48:34.822]  At SSM Cardinal Glennon Children's Medical Center, we celebrate the birth of Jesus and the season of giving, bringing hope to the many children, parents and families that we serve.
[00:48:35.002 --> 00:48:40.446]  Our patients are filled with hope as they receive a message each day from the treasure chest beneath our tree of hope.
[00:48:40.566 --> 00:48:41.747]  They made me smile!
[00:48:41.867 --> 00:48:44.609]  Help us reveal God's healing presence this Christmas.
[00:48:44.869 --> 00:48:46.770]  Send your message of hope at glennon.org.
[00:48:48.651 --> 00:49:05.689]  But ESPN said they would not run that ad because the lines celebrate the birth of Jesus and God's healing message are problematic their word to the network Yeah, and offensive so there you go ladies and gentlemen only in an authoritarian country
[00:49:06.986 --> 00:49:09.989]  Old Soviet Union, would you see something like this?
[00:49:10.249 --> 00:49:12.451]  And remember what came out a few months ago?
[00:49:12.531 --> 00:49:13.051]  We broke it.
[00:49:13.112 --> 00:49:13.912]  People didn't believe it.
[00:49:14.573 --> 00:49:17.395]  And then the documents got released by folks at Fort Hood.
[00:49:18.336 --> 00:49:19.998]  And Fox News finally did pick it up.
[00:49:20.984 --> 00:49:36.681]  That they actually taught them that if you're part of the Tea Party or give money to an evangelical group or a part of it, we're going to court-martial you because these are terrorist groups and under federal law, aiding a terrorist group is punishable by prison.
[00:49:38.122 --> 00:49:42.968]  Yeah, if you send money to the Somali pirates, that's punishable by prison and it should be.
[00:49:44.284 --> 00:49:47.245]  If you give money to Al-Qaeda, that's punishable by prison, and it should be.
[00:49:47.505 --> 00:49:54.108]  But our government's giving money, billions, and arms to Al-Qaeda in Libya, Syria, all over the place, Egypt, that's okay.
[00:49:55.009 --> 00:50:08.014]  But then, if soldiers want to be part of the Tea Party, mainline Americana, not perfect, but, you know, Bill of Rights, Constitution, Family, Second Amendment, national sovereignty, low taxes, sounds like John F. Kennedy type stuff.
[00:50:10.775 --> 00:50:11.776]  If you support that,
[00:50:13.345 --> 00:50:15.546]  Then we're going to court-martial you.
[00:50:15.566 --> 00:50:18.188]  It actually says court-martial you.
[00:50:19.288 --> 00:50:22.210]  Until we exposed it, and others exposed it, and they backed off.
[00:50:22.550 --> 00:50:31.275]  But it shows they're just going to keep pushing, and keep pushing, and keep pushing, and keep pushing, and keep pushing, and keep... I mean, this is incredible.
[00:50:32.836 --> 00:50:34.737]  This is the authoritarianism of these people.
[00:50:36.136 --> 00:50:41.500]  All right, Troy, Ryan, Tom, V, Austin, all of you, your calls are coming up.
[00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:43.922]  A ton of calls coming up into the next hour.
[00:50:45.303 --> 00:50:52.109]  I've got a lot of other news we haven't gotten to yet, but it's just going to have to wait, because I want to take your phone calls.
[00:50:52.129 --> 00:51:01.416]  800-259-9231 is the toll-free number, and we're going to come right back and go to your phone calls on this Thursday, December 12th transmission.
[00:51:01.756 --> 00:51:02.617]  The facts are in.
[00:51:02.798 --> 00:51:03.919]  The studies are legion.
[00:51:04.199 --> 00:51:11.569]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[00:51:11.709 --> 00:51:15.193]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[00:51:15.554 --> 00:51:15.954]  Simple.
[00:51:16.114 --> 00:51:20.480]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[00:51:20.820 --> 00:51:26.263]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[00:51:26.523 --> 00:51:42.530]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield Formulation, fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.

[00:52:02.475 --> 00:52:07.679]  As the year is coming to a close, we all pause to reflect on what's happened in the past year.
[00:52:07.979 --> 00:52:10.782]  We take a step back and thank God for what we have.
[00:52:11.542 --> 00:52:14.344]  I'm David Hall, founder of Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:52:14.605 --> 00:52:20.169]  At Diamond Gusset, we are celebrating the brush fires of liberty that are spreading across this great nation.

[00:54:22.386 --> 00:54:32.653]  Coming up in the next hour, now even small-town cops are getting bomb-resistant war trucks that have been used in Iraq for the Battle of the American People.
[00:54:34.074 --> 00:54:41.279]  The Washington Post crowdsources gun violence stories for Sandy Hook anniversary for another push to now turn Christmas into
[00:54:42.625 --> 00:54:47.349]  Demonization of guns, even though violent crime is down using firearms.
[00:54:48.350 --> 00:54:49.611]  We're going to be going over all that.
[00:54:49.631 --> 00:54:53.374]  I'm going to go right back to your calls or to your calls here in just a moment, right into the next hour.

[00:55:03.481 --> 00:55:08.364]  There is a culture war going on versus individualism and freedom and those that want to push slavery.
[00:55:08.924 --> 00:55:20.890]  And we have the very best health-type products and supplements, the best, in my opinion, coffee in the world from northern areas of Guatemala into southern Mexico, mainly southern Mexico.
[00:55:20.910 --> 00:55:23.111]  In fact, this batch of coffee is from southern Mexico.
[00:55:23.931 --> 00:55:29.774]  Sometimes we can't get it, we'll go over in the future, but bag it and point that out from Guatemala.
[00:55:31.129 --> 00:55:32.410]  It's my favorite type of coffee.
[00:56:01.049 --> 00:56:01.990]  We're good to go.
[00:56:30.632 --> 00:56:31.233]  Hey, it's Troy from St.
[00:56:31.253 --> 00:56:31.393]  Louis.
[00:56:31.413 --> 00:56:37.097]  I just want to let you know, I've been listening since 2006, mainly on WWCR at 9, but also on the podcast.
[00:56:37.117 --> 00:56:37.578]  You should give a St.
[00:56:37.598 --> 00:56:37.898]  Louis affiliate.
[00:57:00.442 --> 00:57:05.874]  Um, anyway, everything's, everything crazy that's going on that you see today, I mean everything...
[00:57:06.701 --> 00:57:19.505]  I don't know if you're... I know you're aware of it, but I don't know if I've actually heard you say that this is just a spiritual war that's going on, and everything is like a physical manifestation of the spiritual war that we're all a part of.
[00:57:19.585 --> 00:57:20.146]  No, that's it!
[00:57:20.166 --> 00:57:30.289]  I mean, you cannot have a children's hospital charity that's Christian put an ad on and say, help us take care of sick kids, because anything Christian is offensive.
[00:57:31.127 --> 00:57:35.770]  No, these people blocking us from access to the airwaves is offensive.
[00:57:35.790 --> 00:57:41.934]  And this is how Hitler started in Germany against groups he was going after, was banning them from advertising.
[00:57:42.355 --> 00:57:46.457]  First they shut you up, then they work your ass to death, then they kill you.
[00:57:46.878 --> 00:57:47.318]  Excuse me.
[00:57:47.598 --> 00:57:54.363]  Yeah, well, yeah, and see, I have a little bit different take on it than I think maybe you or some other people might.
[00:57:54.723 --> 00:57:59.286]  I don't think that the Constitution is the answer because the Constitution isn't the problem.
[00:57:59.989 --> 00:58:01.150]  Satan is the problem.
[00:58:01.711 --> 00:58:07.257]  And the worst kind of lie that people tell themselves, and I see it every day, is the lie that you tell yourself.
[00:58:07.277 --> 00:58:11.622]  So if you're going to lie to yourself, what would stop you from lying to other people?
[00:58:12.243 --> 00:58:14.865]  The answer is Jesus Christ, the spirit of Jesus Christ.
[00:58:14.885 --> 00:58:19.931]  I mean, if people aren't going to obey God's ways, why would anyone think that people are going to obey man's law?
[00:58:19.991 --> 00:58:34.343]  No, no, I hear you, but if you're going to have a rule of law, it should be based on God's law out of the Bible, and that's what I believe the Declaration of Independence, Bill of Rights, and Constitution is, and that's why the devil's forces attack that document perpetually.
[00:58:34.504 --> 00:58:37.826]  So I'm going to come back to you, because I want to continue discussing this, Troy.
[00:58:37.846 --> 00:58:40.088]  I'm going to go to Ryan, Tom, Austin, Dee, and others.
[00:58:42.110 --> 00:58:43.812]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:51.561 --> 00:58:54.303]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[00:58:54.583 --> 00:58:59.427]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[00:58:59.587 --> 00:59:06.752]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[00:59:06.912 --> 00:59:12.317]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[00:59:12.538 --> 00:59:16.261]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[00:59:16.562 --> 00:59:21.086]  We've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[00:59:21.286 --> 00:59:25.230]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power
[00:59:25.230 --> 00:59:26.491]  More outages are out in the field.

[00:59:32.497 --> 00:59:37.041]  Therosafe used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[00:59:37.261 --> 00:59:39.703]  Hand-cranked shortwave AM FM radios.
[00:59:40.144 --> 00:59:47.170]  Everything that we've researched and found to be the best is available at Infowarshop.com and your purchase makes our Infowar possible.
[00:59:47.350 --> 00:59:48.391]  We're getting prepared.
[00:59:48.612 --> 00:59:49.052]  Are you?

[00:59:54.409 --> 00:59:56.350]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.770 --> 00:59:59.751]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:06.152 --> 01:00:06.812]  Big Brother.
[01:00:07.473 --> 01:00:08.493]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:09.233 --> 01:00:10.313]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.974 --> 01:00:11.794]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.554 --> 01:00:13.494]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:14.115 --> 01:00:17.736]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.316 --> 01:00:22.377]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.985 --> 01:00:39.439]  Remember the, uh, con game with the, uh, supposed, uh, person giving hand signs for the hearing impaired at the old Mandela Communism Worship Fest?
[01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:46.406]  Well, now they're saying the interpreter at Mandela event, I was hallucinating visions of angels.
[01:00:48.336 --> 01:00:51.299]  Well, I'm sure the angels were arriving to fight all the devils that were there.
[01:00:51.919 --> 01:00:56.083]  The man accused of fake sign interpretation while standing alongside world leaders like U.S.
[01:00:56.103 --> 01:01:03.930]  President Obama and Nelson Mandela's memorial service said he saw angels at the event and had been violent in the past and suffers from schizophrenia.
[01:01:07.822 --> 01:01:12.843]  I mean, that's about who follows all this stuff is just completely out of their mind, people.
[01:01:13.623 --> 01:01:16.724]  Can you imagine trying to wake that guy up and explain to him the con game?
[01:01:16.744 --> 01:01:26.625]  Can you imagine the people that are going and buying Obamacare because the sexiest man alive is promoting it?
[01:01:29.066 --> 01:01:30.726]  Quote, sexiest man alive.
[01:01:31.526 --> 01:01:35.667]  Listen, I've got this caller here, Troy in St.
[01:01:35.707 --> 01:01:35.987]  Louis,
[01:01:37.225 --> 01:01:39.166]  And I get this a lot from my Christian friends.
[01:01:39.746 --> 01:01:48.131]  They'll say, man, you need to focus on God, on Jesus, and not on the temporal things that are happening here.
[01:01:48.731 --> 01:01:51.313]  And of course, anything of this world is going to end up being evil.
[01:01:52.133 --> 01:01:56.996]  Well, you know, they misinterpret Romans 13 to say, do whatever the government says.
[01:01:57.896 --> 01:02:01.258]  But really, if you read that whole chapter, I've had a lot of preachers who I respect on the subject.
[01:02:02.679 --> 01:02:05.400]  It's like when Christ, you know, said, you know, should we pay taxes?
[01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:07.241]  And others said this, well, who's on the coin?
[01:02:07.421 --> 01:02:07.881]  It's Caesar.
[01:02:07.941 --> 01:02:08.441]  It's his.
[01:02:09.161 --> 01:02:10.482]  So yeah, it's his system.
[01:02:11.402 --> 01:02:12.502]  Come out of Babylon.
[01:02:12.542 --> 01:02:13.603]  Come out of that system.
[01:02:14.543 --> 01:02:15.463]  As much as you can.
[01:02:16.744 --> 01:02:17.764]  But no one's perfect.
[01:02:17.784 --> 01:02:19.024]  You know, we're born on this world.
[01:02:19.084 --> 01:02:20.145]  We, you know, we're of the flesh.
[01:02:21.144 --> 01:02:23.806]  I'm not going to turn this into an ecclesiastical debate.
[01:02:23.946 --> 01:02:26.068]  I just know my heart loves justice and loves God.
[01:02:26.668 --> 01:02:33.874]  And there's a lot of people that only go to church and say, that's the answer, and pray all day, and I don't see them out confronting any evil anywhere.
[01:02:35.635 --> 01:02:42.140]  That's an overgeneralization, but we need to stop hiding in the churches, like our forebearers did, and take down the New World Order.
[01:02:42.941 --> 01:02:47.284]  The Constitution isn't perfect, but it's diametrically opposed to everything the globalists want to do.
[01:02:47.725 --> 01:02:49.026]  That's why they're going after it.
[01:02:50.339 --> 01:03:01.103]  And the Constitution is nothing compared to the Declaration of Independence or Bill of Rights, which themselves point out, this doesn't give you your rights, they're God-given, by our Creator.
[01:03:02.244 --> 01:03:13.088]  So, I see the ideas enshrined, and that doesn't matter if those men weren't fully fulfilling it, those ideas could be fulfilled, and are the blood of liberty.
[01:03:13.788 --> 01:03:18.270]  Now, you've got about a minute and a half, before we go to break, I'm going to come back in a long segment and go to everybody else, but Troy, make your point.
[01:03:19.246 --> 01:03:22.227]  Okay, yeah, there's nothing wrong with the Constitution, don't get me wrong.
[01:03:22.627 --> 01:03:31.589]  I'm just saying that we're ultimately supposed to be living in a kingdom where the king of kings and the lord of all the lords on the earth, he's our benevolent ruler.
[01:03:31.709 --> 01:03:39.411]  And so, I mean, if you think about it, is the Constitution the answer for the people of China, or Brazil, or Ireland, or Australia, or Japan?
[01:03:39.711 --> 01:03:43.492]  No, different people can choose to govern themselves under their own laws here on Earth,
[01:03:44.272 --> 01:03:45.633]  Yeah, but they get conquered.
[01:03:45.673 --> 01:03:46.454]  They've been conquered.
[01:03:46.494 --> 01:03:49.336]  Most of those countries have been conquered by authoritarian systems.
[01:03:49.716 --> 01:03:54.700]  Given a choice, if they could see the fruits of liberty, there's not a group on the world that wouldn't want it.
[01:03:55.901 --> 01:04:03.087]  Right, yeah, and it's the apathy, I guess, we're all seeing it right now, worldwide, by the corporations, the governments, the people.
[01:04:03.708 --> 01:04:06.790]  The answer to it, ultimately, has to lie above the government of man.
[01:04:06.810 --> 01:04:13.215]  We're always going to have the government of man, but above that, we've been shown the right way, the way we're supposed to go.
[01:04:14.657 --> 01:04:19.260]  Honestly, it's my personal opinion that we were never supposed to know right from wrong.
[01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:23.943]  We were never supposed to govern ourselves, but now that we know right from wrong, we have to do what's right.
[01:04:24.443 --> 01:04:28.485]  And you're right, the Constitution definitely shows a way that we can do that.
[01:04:28.505 --> 01:04:28.946]  Sure, sure.
[01:04:28.966 --> 01:04:34.389]  Listen, the whole Garden of Eden deal, from my perspective, it doesn't mean they were completely innocent.
[01:04:36.805 --> 01:04:46.192]  of thoughts that we could see as sin, it's that they were not conscious of it and they were not given the knowledge of good and evil of that you could choose a good system or a bad system.
[01:04:46.913 --> 01:04:54.179]  So it was almost like a viral infection of satanic ways of being parasitic against other humans.
[01:04:54.739 --> 01:05:00.644]  The knowledge of good and evil is the domestication of other humans and actually stealing their free will.
[01:05:01.442 --> 01:05:11.826]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[01:05:12.146 --> 01:05:13.987]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[01:05:14.187 --> 01:05:14.867]  Fluoride!
[01:05:15.067 --> 01:05:16.648]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[01:05:16.988 --> 01:05:23.310]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[01:05:23.570 --> 01:05:28.371]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[01:05:28.491 --> 01:05:34.553]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[01:05:34.793 --> 01:05:36.973]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[01:05:37.233 --> 01:05:39.854]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[01:05:40.154 --> 01:05:43.535]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[01:05:43.655 --> 01:05:48.239]  You will find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:05:49.099 --> 01:05:53.903]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.

[01:06:01.349 --> 01:06:10.356]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:06:10.416 --> 01:06:18.523]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:06:18.823 --> 01:06:23.524]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:06:23.704 --> 01:06:30.426]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[01:06:30.506 --> 01:06:37.568]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:06:37.668 --> 01:06:44.530]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:06:44.690 --> 01:06:49.053]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:06:49.173 --> 01:06:52.435]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[01:06:52.575 --> 01:06:58.698]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[01:06:58.859 --> 01:07:01.040]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com
[01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:02.201]  The facts are in.
[01:07:02.401 --> 01:07:03.522]  The studies are legion.
[01:07:03.802 --> 01:07:11.188]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[01:07:11.309 --> 01:07:14.771]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[01:07:15.132 --> 01:07:15.552]  Simple.
[01:07:15.712 --> 01:07:20.056]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[01:07:20.416 --> 01:07:25.899]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[01:07:26.139 --> 01:07:31.542]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Live Fluoride Shield formulation.
[01:07:31.682 --> 01:07:42.187]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[01:07:42.467 --> 01:07:46.709]  Let's take a stand against the globalists by blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.
[01:07:47.049 --> 01:07:48.810]  I use Fluoride Shield every day.
[01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:54.497]  Secure your fluoride shield and other pioneering formulations at InfoWarsLife.com today.
[01:07:54.758 --> 01:07:59.003]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the Info War at the same time.

[01:08:06.297 --> 01:08:06.937]  Big Brother.
[01:08:07.598 --> 01:08:08.638]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:09.359 --> 01:08:10.479]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:11.140 --> 01:08:11.920]  You want answers?
[01:08:12.701 --> 01:08:13.641]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:14.061 --> 01:08:17.883]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:18.444 --> 01:08:22.566]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:25.348 --> 01:08:34.613]  Yesterday, if you just joined us, the Russian government came out and said that if NATO, that's the United States and Europe, Western Europe, NATO members,
[01:08:35.934 --> 01:08:46.364]  Move missile systems, which are really designed to shoot down a Russian response to a preemptive nuke attack, that if they move those in, they may strike with nuclear weapons.
[01:08:46.384 --> 01:08:48.205]  Well, they didn't say they may.
[01:08:48.245 --> 01:08:50.307]  They said they will respond with nuclear weapons.
[01:08:51.849 --> 01:08:54.251]  And the Russians seem to mean it.
[01:08:55.472 --> 01:09:01.778]  Just like Kennedy said he would basically nuke
[01:09:03.015 --> 01:09:14.143]  Russia, if they didn't pull their ships back that were carrying the warheads and other systems in the early 1960s to be moved to Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[01:09:15.484 --> 01:09:18.986]  And we just put up on screen the Moscow Times for everybody to see.
[01:09:19.646 --> 01:09:23.369]  Paul Watson wrote a story about it at PrisonPlanet.com, picked up by DrudgeReport.com.
[01:09:23.809 --> 01:09:25.490]  Russia warns of nuclear response.
[01:09:28.572 --> 01:09:30.554]  Russia warns of nuclear response to U.S.
[01:09:30.614 --> 01:09:31.915]  Global Strike Program.
[01:09:32.861 --> 01:09:36.864]  Now you have to understand, folks, I've never been to Russia, though I'd like to visit there and many other places.
[01:09:37.745 --> 01:09:42.209]  I'm an American, I had both sides of my family, mother and father side, which is extremely rare.
[01:09:42.249 --> 01:09:43.990]  I'm not bragging, but it's very rare.
[01:09:44.511 --> 01:09:49.855]  Something like 200,000 people can say they had family on the Mayflower, direct descendant, who live in the U.S.
[01:09:49.875 --> 01:09:50.175]  today.
[01:09:50.836 --> 01:09:58.062]  On both sides, it's less than 1,000 people can say that they had both sides of their family directly on the Mayflower.
[01:09:59.141 --> 01:10:00.821]  I mean, I'm as American as it gets.
[01:10:00.881 --> 01:10:06.483]  That was 400 plus years ago that the Mayflower landed here, okay?
[01:10:07.723 --> 01:10:10.384]  So, my family goes back deeply.
[01:10:10.424 --> 01:10:12.364]  The Revolutionary War, Texas Independence.
[01:10:13.084 --> 01:10:20.826]  If there was a revolution, a renaissance happening, some would say a tyranny happening, my bloodline goes right back through it.
[01:10:21.923 --> 01:10:28.449]  That's why I grow like a plant, just like seeds, and look just like and act just like my ancestors.
[01:10:28.870 --> 01:10:29.611]  It's in the blood.
[01:10:30.251 --> 01:10:33.715]  But it's in everyone's blood to want to be free to a certain extent.
[01:10:34.155 --> 01:10:38.079]  My issue is I am 100% American.
[01:10:38.739 --> 01:10:39.460]  100% Americana.
[01:10:40.441 --> 01:10:41.462]  Wait, 400 years?
[01:10:41.502 --> 01:10:42.563]  That's indigenous, folks.
[01:10:42.583 --> 01:10:43.504]  That's a long time.
[01:10:43.524 --> 01:10:46.227]  There have been other people here a lot longer, obviously.
[01:10:47.392 --> 01:10:52.035]  And the issue is, I'm sick of being called a traitor by national media.
[01:10:52.075 --> 01:10:52.616]  It's happened.
[01:10:54.597 --> 01:11:06.365]  And so-called conservative media, mainline right-wing establishment media, whenever I am against messing with Russia, starting wars with Russia, Russia's population is declining massively.
[01:11:06.385 --> 01:11:07.505]  They've got huge problems.
[01:11:07.786 --> 01:11:09.627]  They're not offensive in any way.
[01:11:10.067 --> 01:11:11.108]  They're not expanding.
[01:11:12.902 --> 01:11:28.547]  And our government and NATO is trying to overthrow the Russian government, trying to start revolutions and riots, rolling weapon systems in, putting Al-Qaeda all over the southern area of southern Russia and Central Asia, publicly threatening to activate Al-Qaeda to blow up the Olympics.
[01:11:28.867 --> 01:11:32.168]  That's in mainstream Moscow news, and the Saudi Arabians admit it!
[01:11:32.748 --> 01:11:34.909]  Our allies are threatening to blow up the Russians!
[01:11:35.289 --> 01:11:37.809]  And the Russians have had just about enough, okay?
[01:11:38.210 --> 01:11:39.250]  I don't go start fights.
[01:11:40.390 --> 01:11:41.391]  That's what it comes down to.
[01:11:41.491 --> 01:11:43.232]  And people are like, oh, you're for Russia.
[01:11:43.293 --> 01:11:45.574]  No, I'm for living and not having nuclear war.
[01:11:47.656 --> 01:11:48.177]  How's that sound?
[01:11:48.677 --> 01:11:49.558]  I'm for common sense.
[01:11:50.919 --> 01:11:56.864]  I mean, just because I don't like communism doesn't mean that I'm for crony capitalism and all of its corruptions and all of its exploitation.
[01:11:57.224 --> 01:11:58.025]  I'm for justice.
[01:11:59.366 --> 01:12:02.749]  And when I sit here and I say that, it's not like I'm saying I'm Mr. Goody Two-Shoes.
[01:12:02.909 --> 01:12:05.832]  Wouldn't everybody be for not wanting to have nuclear war with Russia?
[01:12:07.432 --> 01:12:12.134]  Wouldn't everybody know these globalists want total power, they want global domination, just like Hitler?
[01:12:13.915 --> 01:12:16.276]  And so, they will probably push us to the brink.
[01:12:16.716 --> 01:12:20.738]  They've already done it in 2008, almost causing a nuclear war in Georgia.
[01:12:22.499 --> 01:12:36.725]  And our media didn't even cover that the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the Russians and the Russian foreign minister said, we have moved nuclear weapons into Georgia and we will attack the airfields where NATO troops are landing.
[01:12:38.459 --> 01:12:42.243]  Because foreign troops are landing to fight the Russian counter-invasion.
[01:12:42.644 --> 01:12:43.084]  What do you do?
[01:12:43.124 --> 01:12:44.225]  You roll nuclear weapons in.
[01:12:44.566 --> 01:12:47.729]  And they said, and if you respond to that, we're gonna attack Europe.
[01:12:49.171 --> 01:12:52.755]  And if you respond to that, we're gonna attack your military bases in Europe.
[01:12:52.955 --> 01:12:54.196]  That's standard military procedure.
[01:12:54.537 --> 01:12:56.859]  And if you attack that, we're gonna attack the United States.
[01:12:57.880 --> 01:12:58.201]  And we got 10,000
[01:13:00.595 --> 01:13:03.797]  Warheads in ICBMs, ready to launch.
[01:13:04.437 --> 01:13:05.858]  Topol-M missiles, you name it.
[01:13:06.558 --> 01:13:14.803]  I mean, and literally, folks, this was all over the British, all over the Middle Eastern, all over the Russian news, all over the Japanese news, all over the Chinese news.
[01:13:15.783 --> 01:13:23.908]  No one even knew Russia was saying, we're preparing for nuclear war, and rolled the medium-range missile launchers in.
[01:13:26.149 --> 01:13:27.450]  So that they couldn't be targeted.
[01:13:28.541 --> 01:13:30.485]  That's why they're mobile, folks, so they can move around.
[01:13:30.505 --> 01:13:36.358]  From, you know, minute to minute, hour to hour, as satellites target them for... I mean, it's just like...
[01:13:38.359 --> 01:13:42.823]  Nuclear war could start at any time between South Korea, China, Japan.
[01:13:43.263 --> 01:13:47.626]  By the way, China is offensively taking over the planet with the globalists funding them.
[01:13:48.267 --> 01:13:50.569]  They're offensively launching blue water navies.
[01:13:50.869 --> 01:13:52.950]  They're offensively saying they want to nuke the U.S.
[01:13:52.991 --> 01:13:53.611]  preemptively.
[01:13:53.991 --> 01:13:58.455]  They're offensively running around, and there's no issue in the media with China being a problem.
[01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:01.400]  John Kerry says they're our friends.
[01:14:01.460 --> 01:14:02.701]  See, this is so screwed up.
[01:14:03.141 --> 01:14:11.623]  Russia is just kind of flopping around, trying to get itself together, and the globalists are trying to overthrow it, but they've got nuclear weapons.
[01:14:12.583 --> 01:14:18.164]  And then meanwhile, China is ten times the threat Russia is, just running around doing whatever it wants.
[01:14:18.605 --> 01:14:23.946]  The threat, ladies and gentlemen, is the people that run our government, that are endangering our entire planet.
[01:14:24.346 --> 01:14:28.870]  That's what I wanted to get at here, because that's the big news on top of all the Obamacare, all of it.
[01:14:29.470 --> 01:14:32.693]  It shows how out of touch with reality the ruling class is.
[01:14:32.993 --> 01:14:39.639]  They think because they haven't been withheld or restrained by anybody yet, that that's obviously their right to keep escalating things.
[01:14:40.079 --> 01:14:41.781]  And that's how big wars start, folks.
[01:14:43.762 --> 01:14:45.364]  So I would just say to the establishment,
[01:14:46.229 --> 01:14:57.695]  And all the people that demonize me that I work for the Vatican, or I work for Israel when I'm a Protestant Christian, or I work for the Easter Bunny, or any of this, I work for me and my family having a future.
[01:14:58.155 --> 01:14:59.096]  Let's just get that straight.
[01:15:00.797 --> 01:15:04.619]  And I think all of us, when we get demonized, should just identify who we are.
[01:15:04.979 --> 01:15:06.840]  We identify for not having a nuclear war.
[01:15:07.380 --> 01:15:09.382]  We identify with having safe, healthy food to eat.
[01:15:09.642 --> 01:15:10.922]  We identify with having clean water.
[01:15:11.503 --> 01:15:15.645]  We identify with having justice and liberty and a good culture of honorable people.
[01:15:17.794 --> 01:15:20.915]  And if that's alien to new listeners, folks, I'm sorry, okay?
[01:15:23.537 --> 01:15:26.358]  But in the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king, folks.
[01:15:26.518 --> 01:15:31.180]  And all you gotta do is open your eyes up politically, spiritually, socially, and you'll see what's going on.
[01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:32.040]  All right, I'm gonna shut up.
[01:15:32.081 --> 01:15:32.801]  I said I'd go to your calls.
[01:15:32.821 --> 01:15:33.881]  I'm hogging time as usual.
[01:15:34.201 --> 01:15:37.003]  Ryan, Tom, Austin, V, Joseph, bring it to all of you.
[01:15:37.043 --> 01:15:38.003]  Ryan, thanks for holding.
[01:15:38.563 --> 01:15:39.084]  You're on the air.
[01:15:39.124 --> 01:15:39.444]  Go ahead.
[01:15:40.868 --> 01:15:46.891]  Whenever Obama came on the air the first time to speak, he said, America, it is time for a change.
[01:15:47.231 --> 01:15:57.877]  Well, Alex, the way Double Talk works, some of the best, deceptive speakers like to tell their populace that they're really hurting them while it sounds like they're helping them when they're really hurting them.
[01:15:57.897 --> 01:15:58.958]  And what I mean by that is
[01:15:59.966 --> 01:16:04.514]  Well, whenever you hear the word change, you think of, oh, we're going to change this, or we're going to change that.
[01:16:04.554 --> 01:16:07.238]  When you hear of reform, you think it means always good.
[01:16:07.278 --> 01:16:07.438]  No.
[01:16:07.659 --> 01:16:10.383]  You can be run over by an 18-wheeler, and that's a reform.
[01:16:10.623 --> 01:16:12.507]  With all your bones broken, you've been reformed.
[01:16:13.405 --> 01:16:13.725]  Exactly.
[01:16:13.745 --> 01:16:15.366]  You've been reformed into a dead casket.
[01:16:15.846 --> 01:16:23.930]  And the way my brain works, Alex, what I saw that some people don't see, and this may blow your mind, but you've probably seen it because you're a really smart, articulate person.
[01:16:24.631 --> 01:16:27.632]  And what they do is, okay, the word change.
[01:16:27.692 --> 01:16:32.455]  Whenever you buy something at the store or whenever you sell something, i.e.
[01:16:32.495 --> 01:16:38.898]  whenever you sell your country into bondage to the globalist takeover, what do you get back to put into your pocket to change?
[01:16:39.788 --> 01:16:44.431]  And it's all a divide-and-conquer mechanism that they're using, especially with the Obamacare.
[01:16:44.491 --> 01:16:46.032]  Most people... Let's flash back to the 1700s.
[01:16:46.052 --> 01:16:52.095]  Remember the slogan, no taxation without representation?
[01:16:52.636 --> 01:17:01.961]  Well, Obamacare is a federally mandated tax, which is imposed upon the people with a punishment of non-payment, which is taxation without representation.
[01:17:02.021 --> 01:17:06.624]  And it's institutional social control, and it transfers the money to private interest,
[01:17:09.445 --> 01:17:22.560]  Yeah, well food, medicine, and money are the three main resources that the globalists need to be able to alter our perception of reality and to basically control the universe.
[01:17:22.941 --> 01:17:26.745]  And what you're going to see happen, Alex, I don't mean to get all predictive on the air,
[01:17:27.694 --> 01:17:36.239]  I think you're going to see a scare tactic where they're going to use a food shortage to levy the votes for either the 2014 congressional election or for the 2016 presidency.
[01:17:36.279 --> 01:17:41.122]  Because whenever we sell something, Alex, we start by giving away free samples, right?
[01:17:41.182 --> 01:17:41.622]  We know that.
[01:17:42.943 --> 01:17:51.108]  Well, during July, I saw this happen about eight or nine times on the Decepticon media mainstream news, and what they said was,
[01:17:52.011 --> 01:17:54.392]  According to experts... It's always according to experts.
[01:17:54.713 --> 01:18:01.377]  According to experts, today American food was rejected at the ports due to unsafe possibility of consumption.
[01:18:01.837 --> 01:18:09.682]  The food was then later rerouted to China for... Okay, well what they did, Alex, was they called our food unsafe so they could give it to China.
[01:18:10.222 --> 01:18:12.884]  And then we fast forward to the 3rd of July.
[01:18:13.004 --> 01:18:14.485]  I was watching Jay Leno and he said,
[01:18:23.921 --> 01:18:30.804]  No, they're clearly rolling out with an ad campaign throughout the culture that American food isn't safe, Chinese food is safe.
[01:18:31.084 --> 01:18:39.847]  When everybody knows the Chinese food and supplements, drugs, you name it, is the dirtiest in the world probably and the most counterfeited.
[01:18:40.307 --> 01:18:47.269]  Just like there's a rollout still about Amazon and their drones and everyone's saying birds will attack it, it'll crash, your dog will attack it.
[01:18:47.629 --> 01:18:50.230]  When the thing was all cooked up to make everybody say Amazon
[01:18:54.195 --> 01:18:56.758]  I mean, it's totally transparent.
[01:18:57.118 --> 01:19:01.763]  And then people see me talk about that and they debate and say I'm wrong.
[01:19:02.464 --> 01:19:03.686]  There's no way I'm wrong.
[01:19:04.707 --> 01:19:06.429]  It's just absolute ignorance.
[01:19:06.549 --> 01:19:07.370]  You're absolutely right.
[01:19:07.430 --> 01:19:09.012]  So how do we turn this around?
[01:19:10.029 --> 01:19:16.537]  Well, the way we can reverse engineer this, Alex, is, well, we still use the divide-and-conquer mechanism today.
[01:19:16.598 --> 01:19:17.899]  It's still taught in school.
[01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:27.091]  I actually graduate from college tomorrow with an accounting degree and a minor in radio and television communications, so I'm really good at catching continuity errors and how they stage these events.
[01:19:29.648 --> 01:19:32.530]  The way divide and conquer works, Alex, you'll still hear it today.
[01:19:32.570 --> 01:19:35.852]  They call it, well, every time the government does something, they call it something else.
[01:19:35.932 --> 01:19:36.993]  It's like a paradigm shift.
[01:19:37.013 --> 01:19:39.074]  It's like the sine wave or the cosine wave.
[01:19:39.435 --> 01:19:42.877]  It's military technology of a wall of pure deception.
[01:19:43.497 --> 01:19:48.841]  Because even though you know it's all a lie, you know the smoke is obscuring the view, you still can't see through the smoke.
[01:19:49.381 --> 01:19:59.108]  So it's an artificial reality of induced fraud wave, backed up by fraud, to where you just roll over into a catatonic state and begin going,
[01:19:59.912 --> 01:20:00.255]  Mama!
[01:20:01.894 --> 01:20:06.996]  Alex Jones here, and I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show, My Patriot Supply.

[01:22:44.159 --> 01:22:47.822]  So get yourself a Privacy Case.

[01:24:28.577 --> 01:24:36.320]  Let's go right back to your calls.
[01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:38.620]  I'm going to the next segment.
[01:24:39.380 --> 01:24:43.942]  Continuing with calls and then a huge stack of news we haven't gotten to yet on a host of fronts.
[01:24:46.243 --> 01:24:48.443]  Geopolitical, economic, you name it.
[01:24:48.503 --> 01:24:53.385]  And then former Congressman Ron Paul is scheduled to pop in at the bottom of the next hour.
[01:24:53.845 --> 01:24:55.826]  Let's go to Tom in Minnesota.
[01:24:55.866 --> 01:24:56.566]  You're on the air.
[01:24:56.606 --> 01:24:56.946]  Go ahead.
[01:24:58.584 --> 01:24:59.765]  Hey, good afternoon, Alex.
[01:25:00.225 --> 01:25:00.565]  Hey, brother.
[01:25:01.805 --> 01:25:14.511]  Hey, I just want to let you know up here in Minnesota, the last two days, um, or excuse me, on Monday and then again yesterday, KARE 11 News here covered the story about the wireless, uh, cell phone data mesh boxes here.
[01:25:16.231 --> 01:25:16.511]  Really?
[01:25:16.611 --> 01:25:25.135]  And, uh, yeah, and you can go on KARE 11 and find the news story, but, uh, the ACLU has now filed a lawsuit to have the police department turn it off.
[01:25:25.984 --> 01:25:37.656]  Well, I mean, I know Homeland Security pretty much nationwide, starting in big cities like New York, Boston, Seattle, is paying to put in these systems that grab all your phone data illegally.
[01:25:37.676 --> 01:25:42.221]  And then the police always go, oh, we turned it off, and then they'd never turn it off.
[01:25:43.002 --> 01:25:47.266]  But yeah, I wasn't aware that was going in there in, what, Minneapolis, St.
[01:25:47.286 --> 01:25:47.487]  Paul?
[01:25:48.638 --> 01:25:56.861]  Correct sir, yes, and I see the boxes everywhere, and now that it's made the news, I think I might just go out and partake in some extracurricular activities one of these nights.
[01:25:57.181 --> 01:26:05.445]  Oh no, you shouldn't stop an illegal federal government hijacked by foreign banks that took your tax money and put up illegal boxes to steal your data.
[01:26:05.805 --> 01:26:07.806]  Every time they do it, it's a felony.
[01:26:08.086 --> 01:26:10.507]  You shouldn't stop felons operating in the open.
[01:26:11.227 --> 01:26:16.555]  Just because they have badges and guns, you should let them steal all your data and give it to Homeland Security.
[01:26:16.835 --> 01:26:20.079]  Don't climb up there with a baseball bat and beat it all up wearing a mask.
[01:26:20.560 --> 01:26:21.161]  Don't do that.
[01:26:21.221 --> 01:26:22.423]  Do not resist this.
[01:26:22.723 --> 01:26:23.644]  Drink fluoride.
[01:26:23.985 --> 01:26:24.806]  Eat GMO.
[01:26:25.266 --> 01:26:25.767]  Die.
[01:26:25.907 --> 01:26:27.449]  Give the planet to the New World Order.
[01:26:28.424 --> 01:26:30.285]  Turn your children over to government training camps.
[01:26:30.665 --> 01:26:32.786]  Let them put your children on all sorts of drugs.
[01:26:33.146 --> 01:26:36.408]  Let them arrest your children for playing with Nerf guns in the backyard.
[01:26:36.508 --> 01:26:37.028]  It's normal.
[01:26:37.768 --> 01:26:38.629]  We're going to pull it up.
[01:26:38.929 --> 01:26:42.130]  I see you say it's K-A-R-E-11.
[01:26:42.150 --> 01:26:43.811]  That's correct.
[01:26:44.071 --> 01:26:45.192]  What's the name of the headline?
[01:26:45.572 --> 01:26:48.393]  And then we'll go like, oh, Loving Boxes help everyone.
[01:26:49.094 --> 01:26:49.794]  What's the headline?
[01:26:51.051 --> 01:26:58.479]  If you scroll down, it's down and it says something to the effect of cell phone data, and it shows like a hand holding a cell phone.
[01:26:59.059 --> 01:27:01.041]  It's one of their top stories on their homepage.
[01:27:02.522 --> 01:27:07.407]  And it's about a two minute clip, and actually the news anchors are kind of against it, which actually was a surprise.
[01:27:07.427 --> 01:27:10.710]  Oh my gosh, they don't want to live in the Soviet Union?
[01:27:11.884 --> 01:27:18.690]  No, imagine that, you know, our God Obama and his wonderful Obamacare is finally not working out so well.
[01:27:18.710 --> 01:27:19.911]  Well, listen, that is the good news.
[01:27:19.971 --> 01:27:26.276]  I'm seeing local news, I'm seeing police, I'm seeing everybody get it that, whoa, tyranny isn't fun, we don't want this.
[01:27:26.516 --> 01:27:28.437]  And we did find the headline there, it is, good job guys.
[01:27:28.798 --> 01:27:35.923]  We ought to give that story to a Don or Kurt or Daniels because that is national news right there.
[01:27:36.324 --> 01:27:39.426]  We broke this four weeks ago, three and a half weeks ago with StoryLink.com.
[01:27:40.547 --> 01:27:50.429]  On them doing it, they denied it first, then admitted it, and we got the secret documents from the city, inside the city, on how illegal it was, and what they are doing, that they are surveilling everyone.
[01:27:50.849 --> 01:27:54.990]  So it's those documents that show it's illegal, and now we need to move forward.
[01:27:55.030 --> 01:27:59.711]  Then USA Today, Sunday, covered it, and then Drudge Report ended up picking it up.
[01:27:59.771 --> 01:28:08.073]  So, again, it's an example of how the alternative media is key to bubbling this up and forcing it to be covered.
[01:28:09.787 --> 01:28:10.367]  Exactly.
[01:28:10.667 --> 01:28:16.829]  And if I could just ask you one quick question regarding the nascent iodine and the fluoride shield you just came out with?
[01:28:16.869 --> 01:28:17.269]  Yes, sir.
[01:28:18.489 --> 01:28:26.111]  I've been taking the nascent iodine now since I've gotten it, and I'm waiting for my ProPure system to get here so I can get that fluoride out.
[01:28:26.171 --> 01:28:32.172]  But the question I have for you is, if I order the fluoride shield, do I need to stop taking the survival shield?
[01:28:32.930 --> 01:28:40.915]  You need to consult your physician, as Dr. Group and others have said, but it's actually set to be a low dose compared to even some of the other supplements that are out there.
[01:28:42.576 --> 01:28:58.106]  And no, it's designed so you can take them both at the same time, because it's a tiny amount of nascent iodine in the fluoride shield compared to the amount of iodine, because that's all that's in there is iodine and the glycerin base, in the survival shield.
[01:28:58.446 --> 01:29:00.608]  The survival shield is the turbocharging
[01:29:02.098 --> 01:29:12.663]  And it is our best seller for the products, but the fluoride shield itself is, by the way, a two ounce bottle and only like, you know, 20% more.
[01:29:12.703 --> 01:29:14.404]  So it's really the best deal we have.
[01:29:15.045 --> 01:29:23.789]  And it's got the shilajit and a bunch of other things that are shown to cause the metabolic shift, according to Dr. Group and others, to help move it out of the body.
[01:29:24.389 --> 01:29:27.651]  So it doesn't just kind of move around in the body once you extract it out of the tissue.
[01:29:28.231 --> 01:29:33.374]  So according to folks that helped us develop it, it can be taken together.
[01:29:33.434 --> 01:29:35.635]  But there can be detoxing in the first month.
[01:29:35.735 --> 01:29:36.515]  I experienced it.
[01:29:37.115 --> 01:29:38.576]  All this stuff came out of my skin.
[01:29:39.036 --> 01:29:41.998]  People can look at me on TV now and say, man, this guy's been on this three months.
[01:29:42.018 --> 01:29:42.518]  We can see the difference.
[01:29:42.798 --> 01:29:47.541]  And there's no doubt what Dr. Group developed is simply amazing.
[01:29:47.581 --> 01:29:48.041]  God bless you.
[01:29:48.061 --> 01:29:48.761]  Appreciate your call.
[01:29:50.765 --> 01:29:53.754]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.716 --> 01:29:57.384]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:02.042 --> 01:30:08.288]  Strategic relocation is a systematic way to think strategically in the future about how do I safeguard.
[01:30:08.688 --> 01:30:11.090]  Renowned author and expert, Joel Skousen.
[01:30:11.150 --> 01:30:11.470]  The U.S.
[01:30:11.530 --> 01:30:15.654]  isn't building huge underground bases and bunkers because of some terrorist threat.
[01:30:15.754 --> 01:30:18.337]  They know that a massive nuclear attack is coming.
[01:30:18.737 --> 01:30:19.978]  They want that attack to come.
[01:30:20.218 --> 01:30:26.424]  Joel Skousen is renowned as one of the world's foremost experts in strategic relocation and the securing of your home.
[01:30:26.784 --> 01:30:29.248]  What I tell people is that you do have time.
[01:30:29.448 --> 01:30:34.236]  We talk about natural disasters, the health environment, we talk about pollution, the water quality.
[01:30:34.416 --> 01:30:41.868]  My personal experience about being in every one of these states, most people won't even be ready, won't be able to get out of town, because there'll be absolute panic.
[01:30:42.168 --> 01:30:44.709]  There is no preparedness without strategy.
[01:30:44.909 --> 01:30:47.570]  This Christmas, give the gift of preparedness.
[01:30:48.010 --> 01:30:52.271]  Strategic Relocation The Film with Joel Skousen and Alex Jones.
[01:30:52.591 --> 01:30:57.152]  Available only at InfoWarsShop.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:31:01.812 --> 01:31:06.914]  Alex Jones here, and I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show, My Patriot Supply.
[01:31:07.274 --> 01:31:15.756]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[01:31:16.176 --> 01:31:23.479]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow Patriots.
[01:31:23.999 --> 01:31:31.381]  My Patriot Supply brings us their exclusive Patriot Pantry brand, along with many other fine preparedness products.
[01:31:31.901 --> 01:31:35.284]  I personally store and use their high-quality products.
[01:31:35.844 --> 01:31:39.487]  It tastes great, and it's easy to store for up to 25 years.
[01:31:40.027 --> 01:31:46.633]  For a limited time, you can save $50 instantly on a four-week supply of food, along with other special offers.
[01:31:47.193 --> 01:31:53.918]  Visit mypatriotsupply.com forward slash Alex today, with the New World Order making rapid advances on every front.
[01:31:54.399 --> 01:31:58.442]  It is essential to prepare with My Patriot Supply today.
[01:32:00.819 --> 01:32:06.403]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[01:32:06.623 --> 01:32:13.828]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[01:32:14.008 --> 01:32:17.170]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[01:32:17.350 --> 01:32:19.131]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[01:32:19.371 --> 01:32:23.954]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[01:32:24.034 --> 01:32:26.776]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[01:32:26.956 --> 01:32:32.739]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[01:32:32.899 --> 01:32:36.381]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[01:32:36.581 --> 01:32:41.644]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine.
[01:32:41.824 --> 01:32:44.806]  Exclusively available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:32:45.046 --> 01:32:50.912]  Nascent Iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.
[01:32:51.032 --> 01:32:53.034]  Survival Shield Nascent Iodine.
[01:32:53.194 --> 01:32:58.480]  Secure your super high quality Nascent Iodine today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:32:58.720 --> 01:33:00.081]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:33:07.463 --> 01:33:18.210]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.
[01:33:18.351 --> 01:33:23.714]  In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown Dallas.
[01:33:24.155 --> 01:33:29.478]  The first reports say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by the shooting.
[01:33:30.319 --> 01:33:31.560]  It is a big idea.
[01:33:37.526 --> 01:33:39.468]  It was almost as if it were a planned implosion.
[01:33:39.648 --> 01:33:41.130]  It's just pancakes.
[01:33:41.190 --> 01:33:48.237]  Either you were with us, or you were with the terrorists.
[01:34:01.607 --> 01:34:07.029]  I also believe a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:12.100]  Guns will be taken.
[01:34:12.260 --> 01:34:13.961]  No one will be able to be armed.
[01:34:14.001 --> 01:34:15.341]  We're going to take all of them.
[01:34:15.361 --> 01:34:20.002]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city.
[01:34:20.062 --> 01:34:21.522]  Global governance at last.
[01:34:21.622 --> 01:34:22.482]  Is it one world?
[01:34:22.602 --> 01:34:24.263]  The central bank is in charge.
[01:34:24.303 --> 01:34:27.764]  But aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[01:34:27.864 --> 01:34:31.864]  As for me, give me liberty or give me death!
[01:34:34.165 --> 01:34:38.886]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:34:40.439 --> 01:34:45.829]  Alright folks, again we're halfway into this worldwide Thursday edition of the Global Transmission.
[01:34:46.820 --> 01:34:55.342]  Former Congressman Ron Paul with a bunch of economic and political analysis is going to join us in the first half hour of the third hour coming up here in about 25 minutes.
[01:34:56.142 --> 01:34:57.982]  So definitely stay with us for that.
[01:34:59.062 --> 01:35:04.243]  And if you just joined us, the news websites are InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:35:04.283 --> 01:35:14.605]  If you go to InfoWars.com and click on any article page, you'll see a listing up there of basically, I guess the military calls it a ham salad.
[01:35:15.663 --> 01:35:20.225]  Or a tossed salad or whatever it's called of different links.
[01:35:22.085 --> 01:35:33.789]  I say that because it looks like all the medals on the chest where you can go to the different YouTube and Facebook and Twitter and follow us all right there at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:35:36.089 --> 01:35:37.411]  But let's go back to your calls now.
[01:35:37.451 --> 01:35:47.462]  These callers are all really raising important points and I love callers calling in because they end up bringing up local news that becomes national news because they mention it here on air and folks then discover what's happening.
[01:35:47.502 --> 01:35:48.803]  They want to keep us compartmentalized.
[01:35:49.184 --> 01:35:54.029]  The answer is to have local news be local and international and national.
[01:35:54.870 --> 01:35:58.313]  And to have national news be national, international, but also local.
[01:35:58.853 --> 01:36:02.837]  Because the human experience is the human experience regardless.
[01:36:03.377 --> 01:36:06.299]  And then you find what's happening here is happening in Australia.
[01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:07.961]  It's happening in South Africa.
[01:36:08.021 --> 01:36:09.002]  It's happening in Germany.
[01:36:09.042 --> 01:36:10.022]  It's happening in Mexico.
[01:36:10.623 --> 01:36:11.644]  It's happening in Canada.
[01:36:11.684 --> 01:36:12.765]  It's happening in Brazil.
[01:36:13.185 --> 01:36:14.646]  It's happening in Asia.
[01:36:15.187 --> 01:36:15.767]  In Japan.
[01:36:16.127 --> 01:36:21.672]  Because it's global systems that corporations create of fraud and of manipulation.
[01:36:24.113 --> 01:36:26.715]  And being unaware of it is why we're in so much trouble.
[01:36:26.735 --> 01:36:28.276]  People are like, I don't want to know all that.
[01:36:28.296 --> 01:36:29.237]  It sounds like a headache.
[01:36:29.677 --> 01:36:33.080]  It's that mental laziness, folks, that has gotten us in the position we're in.
[01:36:33.460 --> 01:36:35.261]  It's fun to know how stuff works.
[01:36:36.382 --> 01:36:37.763]  It's fun to be informed.
[01:36:39.224 --> 01:36:41.866]  It's great to be part of the animating contest of liberty.
[01:36:42.467 --> 01:36:45.729]  And your animating contest of liberty can be different than mine.
[01:36:48.091 --> 01:36:49.232]  Just be involved.
[01:36:50.113 --> 01:36:51.494]  Just don't be a cookie cutter.
[01:36:53.939 --> 01:36:55.740]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[01:37:14.093 --> 01:37:15.174]  Thank you.
[01:37:15.454 --> 01:37:21.838]  I just wanted to say first, long time listener, first time caller, and I want to thank everything that you do for us.
[01:37:21.858 --> 01:37:22.758]  You know what I mean?
[01:37:23.099 --> 01:37:26.121]  I'm pretty sure win or lose, you're going to, everyone's going to remember you as a hero.
[01:37:26.881 --> 01:37:39.589]  But a point that I wanted to talk about was something concerning about martial law, like as in when it does really does hit the fan, like wherever we're at, whatever the situation or whatever location we're at, like, what do we do?
[01:37:39.629 --> 01:37:41.690]  Do we just like hunker down on where we're at?
[01:37:41.771 --> 01:37:42.391]  Or do we like
[01:37:43.231 --> 01:37:45.694]  You know, I could write a book
[01:37:59.073 --> 01:38:00.354]  About different scenarios.
[01:38:00.374 --> 01:38:02.556]  You never know exactly what's going to happen.
[01:38:03.097 --> 01:38:16.408]  The globalists, the social engineers, want to have an incremental ratcheting up of tyranny and of martial law and armored vehicles and checkpoints and face scanners and systems tracking everyone and internet kill switches.
[01:38:17.749 --> 01:38:19.871]  They want to just slowly turn the heat up and beat us.
[01:38:20.352 --> 01:38:22.814]  But they know if we continue to mount resistance to them,
[01:38:24.352 --> 01:38:26.654]  And it looks like we're about to win and take the country back.
[01:38:26.754 --> 01:38:28.635]  They will blow up a city and say we did it.
[01:38:29.376 --> 01:38:29.796]  Guaranteed.
[01:38:30.477 --> 01:38:31.497]  They'll release a bioweapon.
[01:38:31.517 --> 01:38:32.158]  I mean, there's no telling.
[01:38:32.638 --> 01:38:34.640]  So then folks say, well, then we're totally held hostage.
[01:38:34.660 --> 01:38:35.260]  We can't beat them.
[01:38:35.340 --> 01:38:35.560]  No.
[01:38:36.321 --> 01:38:44.367]  If you're aware of just how bad they are and know what their tricks are, and enough people know that, it'll get to the point where they'll run an NSA algorithm
[01:38:46.175 --> 01:38:47.057]  I know how they operate.
[01:38:47.097 --> 01:38:50.562]  I've studied how they've passed meetings and things that have been declassified or leaked.
[01:38:50.642 --> 01:38:53.967]  They'll say, this isn't going to fly, people aren't going to buy this.
[01:38:55.029 --> 01:38:59.235]  If you back Al-Qaeda and launch an open attack on Syria, the Russians aren't going to back down.
[01:39:00.393 --> 01:39:02.615]  And so the Joint Chiefs went and told Obama you can't do it.
[01:39:02.975 --> 01:39:07.278]  Because public opinion was against it, and the military knew it was a bad operation.
[01:39:07.758 --> 01:39:10.941]  Both morally, but also on where it would probably lead.
[01:39:11.661 --> 01:39:17.886]  So, it's not just good people that are going to turn this around, it's people that are into self-preservation.
[01:39:21.085 --> 01:39:37.600]  Um, what I also, I just, I just wanted to clarify was this, like as far as like when we do, when it's official, when we see on the news CNN or wherever, like breaking news, martial law has been declared and now where troops are leaving the bases into the city streets, like that's what I really want to know, like what do we do if it does come down to that?
[01:39:37.640 --> 01:39:38.020]  Sure, sure.
[01:39:38.501 --> 01:39:39.622]  Well, I appreciate your call, sir.
[01:39:39.662 --> 01:39:41.063]  Let me try to answer that again.
[01:39:41.503 --> 01:39:44.066]  We don't know what scenario it'll be.
[01:39:48.149 --> 01:40:01.107]  Even if they release the bioweapon, or a natural pathogen, bacterial, viral develops, that's killing millions of people, if you're not in the area affected by the bioweapon, you're going to want martial law.
[01:40:01.648 --> 01:40:04.832]  See, it's not just that the martial law is good or bad.
[01:40:06.707 --> 01:40:22.000]  It's that they're preparing us for the martial law, and gearing up for it, and have a history of staging other precipitating events, and then they stand to gain from it, because that's their main philosophy and system of control.
[01:40:23.922 --> 01:40:32.189]  So, let's say some white cop kills some 10-year-old black kid, and it's obviously racist and wrong, and there's video of it.
[01:40:33.732 --> 01:40:53.624]  There will then be a V for Vendetta type scenario, with people so sick of it all, that you'll end up probably having black folks riot and kill people and burn stuff first, and then people are so sick of it, even if the media tries to play it as racial division, you might even start having, you know, whites, Hispanics, others join them in the burning and killing.
[01:40:54.625 --> 01:40:55.786]  Ever think about that?
[01:40:57.108 --> 01:41:05.658]  So there's scenarios that, because they've tried to divide us, that could backfire on them and actually explode in ways they don't know.
[01:41:06.039 --> 01:41:08.061]  And that's really where the war gaming comes in.
[01:41:08.081 --> 01:41:13.007]  And the establishment even admits this in higher level white papers out there that we've covered.
[01:41:13.047 --> 01:41:13.688]  You can look up.
[01:41:13.748 --> 01:41:14.388]  It's just Legion.
[01:41:15.313 --> 01:41:36.158]  That even though they've got all this Google system and NSA system to try to gauge the future and try to steer reality, because if you're aware of the trends you can then add data and add stimuli to be able to steer it the way you want, it starts gyrating out of control and you're unable to maintain
[01:41:38.066 --> 01:41:40.928]  The controlled cultural implosion.
[01:41:41.549 --> 01:41:57.362]  You see, they say they want to dumb us down, distract us, put us in a false reality ahead of incremental phasing out of the mass population because we're destructive, we're bad for the earth, and because they're not going to be able to control 7, 8, 10, 20 billion people.
[01:41:57.762 --> 01:41:58.783]  Already 7.5 billion.
[01:41:59.083 --> 01:42:02.106]  So I get the elite saying they're sitting on top of time bomb.
[01:42:03.160 --> 01:42:04.562]  And sitting on top of something.
[01:42:04.622 --> 01:42:15.115]  The problem is, they've helped create this, and clearly with my own organic computer, I can analyze history, spectrums, common sense, and tell that what they've done to be in control...
[01:42:17.356 --> 01:42:37.229]  has actually created the greater threat by removing the normal inhibitions and programming in the public towards good social order, because they were in a revolution against good social order, seeing it as a threat to their hegemonic rule, but now they've destroyed the very underpinning of societal stability.
[01:42:37.569 --> 01:42:41.591]  But then enters the larger spiritual nature of these systems,
[01:42:42.652 --> 01:42:49.075]  And that at the base of it, they can intellectually claim why they're doing what they're doing, but the fruits are entirely different.
[01:42:49.535 --> 01:43:03.720]  And at the heart of it is a love of degeneracy, a love of betrayal, a love of failure, a love of collapse, a love of all the curses that follow the manifestation of a Babylonian system.
[01:43:08.202 --> 01:43:10.303]  So, you ask me questions about
[01:43:13.188 --> 01:43:17.330]  You ask me questions about what do you do when there's troops on the streets.
[01:43:18.730 --> 01:43:22.732]  If the troops are maintaining order from groups that are running around killing people, you support them.
[01:43:23.892 --> 01:43:30.695]  If the troops are quarantining cities to keep a bio-release out, even if the globalists released it, we're with the troops, they're with us.
[01:43:30.955 --> 01:43:32.636]  We don't want to die from the bio-release.
[01:43:32.956 --> 01:43:33.896]  We want it contained.
[01:43:34.916 --> 01:43:36.037]  So you support them.
[01:43:37.842 --> 01:43:54.131]  If the troops, though, stage a bio-attack, or somebody else does, and they use that to say, turn your guns in, ahead of us coming into your area, then you know it's predatory, and you have to try to stay out of their way, get to a rural area, and try to not engage them.
[01:43:54.151 --> 01:43:56.433]  Because it does nothing to the New World Order to kill a bunch of troops.
[01:43:57.153 --> 01:44:00.155]  If they stage a revolution, nuke a city, say the Patriots did it,
[01:44:02.199 --> 01:44:08.843]  Come after the Patriot leaders and try an open coup or push because they're not... The Globals don't even go with the best plans.
[01:44:08.903 --> 01:44:12.705]  I hate to even lay out what I think they would do because sometimes it's better than what they'd even come up with.
[01:44:13.206 --> 01:44:14.887]  They're very unimaginative because they're so evil.
[01:44:16.237 --> 01:44:21.498]  If they just try to open roundup of the Patriot leaders, well, then you know what's happening and you know what to do, folks.
[01:44:21.518 --> 01:44:25.879]  You've got to fight back against the dumb cops that come in the armored vehicles, against the military.
[01:44:26.179 --> 01:44:27.259]  They're engaged in treason.
[01:44:27.279 --> 01:44:29.600]  They're trying to take you and your family to a FEMA camp.
[01:44:30.080 --> 01:44:31.500]  They're trying to take you for re-education.
[01:44:31.540 --> 01:44:32.820]  That's in the official Army manuals.
[01:44:33.381 --> 01:44:34.101]  Try to avoid them.
[01:44:34.121 --> 01:44:34.941]  Try to stay out of their way.
[01:44:34.981 --> 01:44:40.142]  But a lot of military people intend, while you are trying to get out of the way, they're going to go attack.
[01:44:40.942 --> 01:44:42.642]  And that's just, that's the consensus.
[01:44:43.163 --> 01:44:44.743]  And I'm just, listen, this,
[01:44:46.960 --> 01:44:57.552]  This is so sophisticated that as a general in the Info War, you have to understand I cannot sit there and play out the endless permutations of war games for you on air.
[01:44:58.854 --> 01:45:06.783]  If you want to see, it's Army Regulation 210-35, Civilian Inmate Labor Program.
[01:45:09.181 --> 01:45:10.244]  That's just one of the programs.
[01:45:10.264 --> 01:45:12.650]  You can look up the re-education camp documents.
[01:45:12.670 --> 01:45:15.438]  Just type in army manual re-education camp.
[01:45:15.678 --> 01:45:18.064]  They even use the Soviet term re-education camp.
[01:45:19.935 --> 01:45:28.621]  And all of this troops and police, you know, for one gunman or whatever, and strutting around is all like a dog hiking its leg urinating on you to show dominance.
[01:45:28.641 --> 01:45:30.542]  You know, we roll over and show our belly.
[01:45:31.042 --> 01:45:32.603]  And the cops know that deep down.
[01:45:33.064 --> 01:45:35.986]  They think they're on top because they're in a hierarchical situation.
[01:45:36.626 --> 01:45:38.627]  So they themselves are more controlled than anybody.
[01:45:39.068 --> 01:45:40.168]  We're going to have to lead.
[01:45:40.188 --> 01:45:44.071]  And listen, the most important thing is that
[01:45:46.143 --> 01:45:49.364]  That's FM3-39.40, Interment Resettlement Operations, 2010.
[01:45:49.544 --> 01:45:56.226]  If you want to see the re-education camp for how they process your social security number, how they break you and your family up.
[01:45:56.986 --> 01:46:06.089]  I mean, I don't want to physically have a war, and I do a trillion times more speaking out than I would do as one combatant, as they would call me.
[01:46:06.809 --> 01:46:08.310]  But at the same time, just as a man,
[01:46:09.494 --> 01:46:12.996]  I can guarantee, I know how we all are.
[01:46:13.616 --> 01:46:21.460]  It's not that we are afraid to get a shooting war going, it's just we want to win it the other way and are very sad about where all this is going.
[01:46:21.980 --> 01:46:28.464]  But once the bullets start flying, once the triggers start pulling, Americans love to fight more than anybody in the world.
[01:46:29.844 --> 01:46:30.685]  And we love to kill.
[01:46:31.716 --> 01:46:32.476]  Once we're in the right.
[01:46:32.816 --> 01:46:34.537]  I mean, I'm a killing machine.
[01:46:35.437 --> 01:46:39.478]  Any man who's got their head screwed on straight is a killing machine.
[01:46:43.999 --> 01:46:48.580]  And I don't even want to think about those areas of my mind.
[01:46:50.341 --> 01:46:59.183]  But anybody hurts my family, anybody messes with me, anybody tries to run some Soviet crap, we are going to absolutely go haywire.
[01:46:59.223 --> 01:47:00.543]  And everybody knows that, by the way.
[01:47:05.086 --> 01:47:12.349]  So everybody trying to start war with the Russians, trying to start war here, you globalists aren't going to be safe in your bunkers.
[01:47:13.269 --> 01:47:15.450]  And let me tell you, whether you're in the police, the military, I don't care.
[01:47:15.590 --> 01:47:18.271]  Our enemy, collectively, are these crazy people!
[01:47:19.711 --> 01:47:21.252]  They all want us to fight with each other.
[01:47:21.272 --> 01:47:22.052]  This is a joke!
[01:47:26.109 --> 01:47:28.551]  So he gets me to start thinking about what I'll do during this.
[01:47:28.712 --> 01:47:31.134]  I don't know, because there's a lot of different scenarios.
[01:47:31.975 --> 01:47:33.697]  I'm gonna try to stay out of a fight.
[01:47:34.497 --> 01:47:36.119]  I'm gonna try to stay out of trouble.
[01:47:40.083 --> 01:47:42.706]  But if it's a war they want, it's a war they'll get.
[01:47:43.446 --> 01:47:45.769]  They start the fight, they'll get a response.
[01:47:47.130 --> 01:47:49.472]  And they know they won't have the moral high ground if they do that.
[01:47:50.013 --> 01:47:54.998]  So what the technocrats are going to do is carry out atrocities in our name.
[01:47:55.278 --> 01:47:56.239]  So what do we do?
[01:47:56.319 --> 01:48:06.410]  We inoculate psychologically the fact that false flag is historical, is the majority of the attacks, and that they have the mode of the means, the capacity, the history of doing it.
[01:48:06.650 --> 01:48:10.153]  They are the prime suspects of any event when it transpires.
[01:48:10.754 --> 01:48:11.515]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:48:11.855 --> 01:48:18.040]  And everyone in the system better have a debate about this right now, because I know 98% of you are good men and women in the system.
[01:48:18.280 --> 01:48:19.861]  I don't care if it's public, private, corporate.
[01:48:21.062 --> 01:48:27.367]  And let me tell you, just like the Joint Chiefs went to Obama and said, we're not going to launch a war with Syria and have a fight with Russia.
[01:48:28.568 --> 01:48:32.911]  A, this is very immoral and we started this with Al-Qaeda and we're backing Al-Qaeda.
[01:48:33.532 --> 01:48:34.172]  Don't do it.
[01:48:35.954 --> 01:48:38.656]  And that's the kind of thing that's going to save us, folks.
[01:48:40.620 --> 01:48:47.883]  That's the kind of thing that when the Joint Chiefs came to Kennedy, it was the other way around in 1961-62, and they said, we want to preemptively nuke Russia.
[01:48:47.903 --> 01:48:48.743]  This has been declassified.
[01:48:49.623 --> 01:48:51.984]  And Kennedy had been pro-war, a big hawk, you know, he was a veteran.
[01:48:52.004 --> 01:48:54.805]  He was like, I'm against communism and I'm not going to start a war with them.
[01:48:54.825 --> 01:48:55.406]  That's evil.
[01:48:55.946 --> 01:48:57.887]  That's what Dr. Strangelove, the movie, is basically all about.
[01:48:57.927 --> 01:48:58.747]  Real stuff that happened.
[01:48:59.267 --> 01:49:03.429]  Minus the attack actually being launched by LeMay, who's General Jack T. Ripper in the film.
[01:49:04.789 --> 01:49:08.190]  Stanley Kubrick's black satire masterpiece.
[01:49:11.565 --> 01:49:15.508]  In that, you see the mindset of these people.
[01:49:16.489 --> 01:49:22.573]  And they came to Kennedy and said, we want to launch a preemptive nuclear war on them, and we want to stage some terror attacks in America to do it.
[01:49:23.294 --> 01:49:24.675]  And Kennedy said, you're fired.
[01:49:28.377 --> 01:49:29.058]  You're fired.
[01:49:31.923 --> 01:49:42.511]  Basically, Peter Sellers, you know, repeats it where they're sitting in the war room and they want him to launch a preemptive attack on Russia since the bombers have already been launched under Plan R by General Jack D. Ripper, aka Jack the Ripper.
[01:49:43.472 --> 01:49:45.093]  And they go, come on, sir, it's already been committed.
[01:49:45.113 --> 01:49:51.498]  Don't think about yourself in the history books when the President says, I don't want to go down in history as the greatest killer since Hitler.
[01:49:57.278 --> 01:50:01.122]  We're going to come back and go to V, Wesley, Jody, Jim, and others ahead of Ron Paul.
[01:50:01.783 --> 01:50:03.945]  Briefly, remember this broadcast is Lister-supported.
[01:50:04.206 --> 01:50:05.907]  We try to bring you high-quality products.
[01:50:06.348 --> 01:50:15.218]  You can't get the 20% off on the Pro-Pure water filters anymore with the promo code WATER20, but you can still get a great deal on the lowest price with promo code WATER.
[01:50:16.118 --> 01:50:17.120]  Just the promo code WATER.
[01:50:18.373 --> 01:50:21.714]  They are the gravity-fed stainless steel filters that blow away the competition.
[01:50:21.754 --> 01:50:23.195]  We have side-by-side comparisons.
[01:50:23.215 --> 01:50:25.736]  You can take water right out of a pond, a lake, you name it.
[01:50:25.776 --> 01:50:28.817]  Filters it right through, but it also takes up the fluoride, the glyphosate, all of it.
[01:50:29.137 --> 01:50:31.198]  This is the best at the lowest price.
[01:50:31.258 --> 01:50:32.239]  Promo code WATER.
[01:50:32.939 --> 01:50:35.160]  Ah, they still haven't taken promo code WATER 20 down.
[01:50:35.500 --> 01:50:35.760]  Fine.
[01:50:35.860 --> 01:50:36.540]  Five more minutes.
[01:50:36.920 --> 01:50:38.181]  I've been told this morning, take it down.
[01:50:38.641 --> 01:50:40.123]  Whatever, you can still do it for a few more minutes.
[01:50:40.163 --> 01:50:44.607]  That's not a sales tactic, though it, I guess, is now, just by evidence that they haven't taken it down.
[01:50:44.928 --> 01:50:46.029]  You can still do Water 20.
[01:50:46.069 --> 01:50:48.872]  I just told the manufacturer I'd quit doing it today, so, or yesterday.
[01:50:49.352 --> 01:50:58.141]  Water 20, you can still do it 20% off on all the great Pro1, ProPure systems at InfowarsStore.com or by calling 888-253-3139.

[01:52:01.533 --> 01:52:06.075]  Bulletproof glass is great, if you don't mind being shot at without being able to defend yourself.
[01:52:07.296 --> 01:52:11.318]  It's said the best defense is a strong offense, an overwhelming offense.
[01:52:12.619 --> 01:52:14.840]  At OffTheGrid.com, we couldn't agree more.
[01:52:15.660 --> 01:52:20.002]  Return Fire Bulletproof Glass disintegrates bullets fired at you on impact.
[01:52:20.923 --> 01:52:28.367]  While you're able to return fire on your aggressor from the other side, your bullets hit their mark, unobstructed by the Return Fire Glass.
[01:52:29.307 --> 01:52:31.148]  Your aggressor won't know what hit him.
[01:52:31.348 --> 01:52:32.148]  Man down.
[01:52:32.628 --> 01:52:34.109]  Return Fire Bulletproof Glass.

[01:53:01.503 --> 01:53:04.926]  It's been said, those who control the food, control the people.
[01:53:05.166 --> 01:53:08.889]  Are you concerned about GMO foods making you sick and affecting your mind?
[01:53:08.989 --> 01:53:14.894]  Many people suffer from lack of energy, insomnia, loss of stamina, weight gain, and the inability to think clearly.
[01:53:15.194 --> 01:53:16.555]  Genetically modified crops,
[01:53:16.715 --> 01:53:25.257]  Processed foods and toxic chemicals can compromise your health and are silently destroying your digestive system, which accounts for 80% of your immune system.

[01:54:13.977 --> 01:54:16.137]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:54:16.598 --> 01:54:18.298]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:54:20.578 --> 01:54:26.359]  Now scientists are saying that the universe collapsed back into the Big Bang tomorrow.
[01:54:26.379 --> 01:54:32.240]  And then another day they say it's going to keep expanding for 50 billion more years.
[01:54:32.260 --> 01:54:33.860]  The truth is they don't know anything.
[01:54:34.781 --> 01:54:37.861]  Science is being turned on its head every day, not every week.
[01:54:38.701 --> 01:54:42.322]  And the truth is we're living in the middle of an incredible, wondrous mystery.
[01:54:43.627 --> 01:54:59.401]  And my greatest regret is that we spend so much time focused in on what the globalists are doing and the control freaks are doing because we have to or they'll ruin our lives and ruin our planet instead of marveling at the creation all around us.
[01:55:02.303 --> 01:55:03.965]  I just want to see humanity succeed.
[01:55:04.025 --> 01:55:07.328]  If folks ask me what I stand for, we tell people what we stand for.
[01:55:09.292 --> 01:55:10.914]  Versus what the technocrats stand for.
[01:55:11.194 --> 01:55:12.675]  They say humanity's ugly and bad.
[01:55:12.695 --> 01:55:14.357]  They're gonna get rid of us and merge with machines.
[01:55:14.897 --> 01:55:16.699]  That's the official policy of these people.
[01:55:19.001 --> 01:55:23.005]  That's the official idea of Ray Kurzweil that heads up Google's futurist project.
[01:55:23.505 --> 01:55:24.286]  He's on their board.
[01:55:26.268 --> 01:55:28.049]  Does that mean that everybody at Google's bad?
[01:55:28.129 --> 01:55:28.349]  No.
[01:55:30.251 --> 01:55:31.653]  Does it mean everybody at, uh...
[01:55:32.762 --> 01:55:37.263]  Microsoft is bad, just because Bill Gates is certifiably a New World Order eugenicist?
[01:55:37.843 --> 01:55:38.063]  No!
[01:55:38.543 --> 01:55:41.944]  But the directive from the top is corrupt and bad.
[01:55:43.084 --> 01:55:45.525]  Same thing with the police departments, all of it.
[01:55:47.846 --> 01:55:57.628]  Here's Paul Watson's article, The Dark Side of Ray Kurzweil's Transhumanist Utopia, The Elite's Obsessive Pursuit of Immortality and the New Tool of Class Enslavement.
[01:55:58.048 --> 01:55:59.008]  Let's go back to your calls.
[01:55:59.148 --> 01:56:01.969]  V in Nevada, thanks for calling in.
[01:56:03.777 --> 01:56:06.158]  Ernest, salutations, my fellow American.
[01:56:06.498 --> 01:56:10.921]  Please bear with me, I just had a major dental surgery.
[01:56:11.041 --> 01:56:13.462]  Okay.
[01:56:14.243 --> 01:56:21.627]  I guess I could start out like everyone else and say, oh Alex, I love what you do, and thank you so much, and yada yada yada.
[01:56:23.007 --> 01:56:25.108]  Now hear me out, I hate what you do.
[01:56:25.529 --> 01:56:29.991]  Because it's a weather vane.
[01:56:31.249 --> 01:56:38.754]  I agree with you.
[01:56:40.515 --> 01:56:53.043]  It's almost like I'm play-by-play chronicling and it can almost demoralize people and I'm almost acclimating people and that is a side effect of what I do.
[01:56:53.863 --> 01:56:59.855]  But overall, I believe in humanity and that people will rise against the tyranny and not just accept it.
[01:57:00.155 --> 01:57:05.165]  But undoubtedly with some people, it demoralizes them because they're timid spirits.
[01:57:06.018 --> 01:57:06.198]  Go ahead.
[01:57:06.218 --> 01:57:07.279]  I'm right with you.
[01:57:07.379 --> 01:57:08.179]  I'm right with you.
[01:57:08.299 --> 01:57:10.780]  And you know, I agree a hundred percent.
[01:57:10.800 --> 01:57:12.101]  Um, I love you.
[01:57:12.801 --> 01:57:16.483]  From one man, from a black man to a white man, believe it or not, I love you.
[01:57:16.643 --> 01:57:18.484]  Believe it or not, we're all just human beings.
[01:57:19.144 --> 01:57:20.124]  We are!
[01:57:20.304 --> 01:57:22.465]  And that's what I try to get people to see every day.
[01:57:22.505 --> 01:57:25.287]  I got people who are kind of old school and they're thinking this and that.
[01:57:25.307 --> 01:57:26.547]  I don't want to get sidetracked.
[01:57:26.587 --> 01:57:27.007]  Okay, look.
[01:57:28.808 --> 01:57:30.449]  There is a local, uh,
[01:57:31.650 --> 01:57:32.310]  Uh, paper here.
[01:57:32.390 --> 01:57:33.410]  This needs to go national.
[01:57:33.450 --> 01:57:35.631]  That's why I called Alex the Megaphone Jones.
[01:57:35.911 --> 01:57:36.211]  Okay?
[01:57:37.271 --> 01:57:40.452]  There is, uh, a story here at the- I need one of your guys.
[01:57:40.472 --> 01:57:42.012]  I know you got info hounds there.
[01:57:42.032 --> 01:57:43.532]  That's why I called, and that's why I called myself.
[01:57:44.292 --> 01:57:47.013]  Um, have them go to the, uh, NSA spy grid.
[01:57:47.373 --> 01:57:47.853]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:57:47.893 --> 01:57:49.153]  I mean internet search engine.
[01:57:49.353 --> 01:57:50.134]  Google.com.
[01:57:50.994 --> 01:57:54.594]  Put in Mandela Family Charade.
[01:57:54.894 --> 01:57:57.175]  C-H-A-R-A-D-E.
[01:57:57.455 --> 01:57:57.735]  Okay?
[01:57:58.607 --> 01:58:02.531]  It's going to take you, it's a local newspaper here called Guardian LV.
[01:58:02.851 --> 01:58:05.073]  That's going to be the first part of the URL.
[01:58:06.374 --> 01:58:20.067]  Alex, in this article, breaking news baby, in this article, this young woman reports that Nelson Mandela was reported dead back in June, okay?
[01:58:20.107 --> 01:58:22.410]  They had been sending people over to South Africa
[01:58:23.323 --> 01:58:24.544]  No, actually, sir, stay there.
[01:58:24.564 --> 01:58:29.767]  I'm going to hold over with you, and then Ron Paul's coming up after this break, and then I'll go to the other calls after Ron Paul leaves at the bottom of the hour.
[01:58:31.768 --> 01:58:38.732]  I saw it in mainstream news that people have been demanding to see him for months, and that there was a big thing saying he'd been dead for a while.
[01:58:39.532 --> 01:58:40.493]  Hold on, let's talk about it.
[01:58:43.034 --> 01:58:43.995]  We did find the article.
[01:58:44.055 --> 01:58:46.656]  We're going to get it up on InfoWars.com right now.
[01:58:51.337 --> 01:58:52.978]  Introducing Pro-1.

[01:59:49.404 --> 01:59:55.148]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:06.109 --> 02:00:06.729]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.409 --> 02:00:08.430]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:09.170 --> 02:00:10.290]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.931 --> 02:00:11.731]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.511 --> 02:00:13.411]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.052 --> 02:00:17.693]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.253 --> 02:00:22.314]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:38.559 --> 02:00:45.541]  All right, V in Nevada, ahead of Ron Paul joining us, then we'll go to Jody and Wesley and Jim and Mike and everybody else that's holding.
[02:00:46.301 --> 02:00:52.043]  Yeah, I remember seeing this months ago that no one's seen Nelson Mandela, no one was allowed to go in and see him.
[02:00:52.783 --> 02:00:57.364]  There was a big debate about whether he was alive or not, and they do this a lot when famous world leaders die.
[02:00:57.724 --> 02:01:00.385]  The Soviets would do this, and these are communists, so they act the same.
[02:01:00.785 --> 02:01:03.006]  They would hide the fact that they'd been dead for a while.
[02:01:03.766 --> 02:01:08.669]  You also saw speculation that Castro's been dead a bunch too, so it doesn't always mean that.
[02:01:09.369 --> 02:01:23.838]  But I saw this last week and this week, I did see it in foreign press that family had been demanding to see him, others had been demanding to see him, and then it was that they couldn't cover it up anymore, so they just suddenly announced he passed in the night, no details of why.
[02:01:24.498 --> 02:01:28.621]  And just the pieces I've got on the way communists operate, they follow a handbook,
[02:01:30.062 --> 02:01:33.845]  You have the article here out of your local paper, and it's got basically the same stuff I've seen.
[02:01:34.645 --> 02:01:35.866]  I'm glad you raised this.
[02:01:36.066 --> 02:01:40.690]  So tell folks what the article's about, and we're going to get it linked up on Infowars.com right now.
[02:01:41.290 --> 02:01:41.731]  You bet.
[02:01:41.831 --> 02:01:42.251]  You bet.
[02:01:42.331 --> 02:01:46.534]  And I could not be prouder to be handing it to Alex Jones himself, sir.
[02:01:46.875 --> 02:01:47.515]  Check this out.
[02:01:48.416 --> 02:01:53.640]  Reading into the article, the young woman has come under fire here, too, in other local news.
[02:01:53.700 --> 02:01:54.741]  I've been looking into it.
[02:01:55.801 --> 02:01:59.004]  They had a denial-of-service attack.
[02:01:59.437 --> 02:02:06.739]  They had a denial of service attack perpetrated on them, like, probably the same day that they tried to break this news.
[02:02:07.399 --> 02:02:10.899]  Their, that entire news website was shut down for three days.
[02:02:11.359 --> 02:02:13.180]  And they've- No, I know the Guardian Express.
[02:02:13.260 --> 02:02:14.660]  It seems like a pretty good publication.
[02:02:15.160 --> 02:02:15.620]  Go ahead.
[02:02:15.860 --> 02:02:16.721]  They're pretty good.
[02:02:16.761 --> 02:02:19.401]  You know, they break some kind of juicy stuff.
[02:02:19.441 --> 02:02:20.661]  You know, I'm an info hound, man.
[02:02:20.701 --> 02:02:23.502]  I'm going to look for the truth.
[02:02:24.466 --> 02:02:28.768]  They traced the denial of service attack back to South Africa.
[02:02:28.968 --> 02:02:33.170]  There is your caramelizer, your crystallizer.
[02:02:33.950 --> 02:02:40.773]  This is probably one of the single most capped and covered news stories ever.
[02:02:40.813 --> 02:02:42.653]  Now, I've been digging.
[02:02:44.294 --> 02:02:49.576]  For some reason or another, right after Obama showed up there, is when the machine will shut off.
[02:02:49.616 --> 02:02:51.197]  Now, if you look in this article, it says
[02:02:52.102 --> 02:02:57.884]  That the family was debating over some kind of estate or something like that.
[02:02:57.924 --> 02:03:02.646]  They were having a legal, you know, tie-up and that Mandela wasn't basically there to make the decision.
[02:03:03.006 --> 02:03:12.469]  So they had to keep him alive because you can't have these sorts of legal proceedings over an estate and stuff if a person is dead.
[02:03:12.769 --> 02:03:18.731]  So they've basically been pumping air into a corpse in order to keep him alive so that the judicial
[02:03:19.326 --> 02:03:21.008]  I'm sorry, oh God, this sounds terrible.
[02:03:21.228 --> 02:03:24.451]  So that the legal proceedings could, you know, continue.
[02:03:24.531 --> 02:03:27.254]  They can continue to fight over, you know, what's going on.
[02:03:27.334 --> 02:03:39.805]  I don't know what happened, but once Obama showed up, okay, and now he's been, you know, supposedly the life support's been turned off or whatnot, me and my sister are very passionate about this kind of thing.
[02:03:40.466 --> 02:03:43.509]  And she found even that they had the casket
[02:03:44.668 --> 02:03:55.871]  They just recently put the casket out in public, and I will bet you every gun in my arsenal, and I love my guns, that they've got people out there walking around in empty caskets.
[02:03:56.251 --> 02:03:59.712]  I promise you, Mandela's been dead for about six months probably.
[02:04:00.092 --> 02:04:03.933]  And the fact that this site was attacked, you know how these globalists work, you know!
[02:04:04.874 --> 02:04:09.955]  Whenever something's on the level and it's going to inform people, they come out and get it.
[02:04:10.295 --> 02:04:13.716]  So, the denial of service is traced back to South Africa, and
[02:04:14.981 --> 02:04:18.082]  I really just want to have you completely read that article.
[02:04:18.322 --> 02:04:19.502]  I want Alex Jones.
[02:04:19.762 --> 02:04:20.642]  Do me the honor.
[02:04:21.102 --> 02:04:21.902]  Read that article.
[02:04:21.922 --> 02:04:26.723]  I mean, I remember that hearing about people saying, where is he?
[02:04:26.763 --> 02:04:28.623]  He's dead in a controversy in South Africa.
[02:04:28.963 --> 02:04:30.184]  People can pull those articles up.
[02:04:30.244 --> 02:04:31.844]  Watson or somebody could do an article about this.
[02:04:32.204 --> 02:04:33.764]  So that was definitely a controversy.
[02:04:33.784 --> 02:04:35.004]  And then they just finally said he was dead.
[02:04:35.024 --> 02:04:40.305]  And people will do this so that they can continue to operate and sign his name and do things.
[02:04:40.385 --> 02:04:43.386]  I mean, this sounds like how a bunch of murdering communists would operate.
[02:04:44.306 --> 02:04:45.066]  Standard procedure.
[02:04:45.106 --> 02:04:47.147]  Thank you very much for reminding us of that story.
[02:04:47.607 --> 02:04:48.628]  We'll look into it.
[02:04:48.668 --> 02:04:49.688]  Very, very interesting.
[02:04:50.069 --> 02:04:50.429]  All right.
[02:04:50.489 --> 02:04:53.010]  Former Congressman Ron Paul is scheduled to be joining us.
[02:04:53.430 --> 02:04:55.631]  Coming up, all this and more.
[02:04:55.671 --> 02:04:57.232]  Straight ahead, InfoWars.com.
[02:05:01.397 --> 02:05:02.238]  The facts are in.
[02:05:02.418 --> 02:05:03.538]  The studies are legion.
[02:05:03.818 --> 02:05:11.202]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[02:05:11.342 --> 02:05:14.804]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[02:05:15.164 --> 02:05:15.565]  Simple.
[02:05:15.725 --> 02:05:20.107]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[02:05:20.447 --> 02:05:25.908]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[02:05:26.148 --> 02:05:31.530]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield Formulation.
[02:05:31.690 --> 02:05:42.152]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[02:05:42.492 --> 02:05:46.735]  Let's take a stand against the globalists by blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.

[02:06:10.470 --> 02:06:18.537]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:06:18.857 --> 02:06:23.559]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[02:06:37.704 --> 02:06:44.567]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:06:44.727 --> 02:06:49.091]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[02:07:01.341 --> 02:07:11.729]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[02:07:12.029 --> 02:07:13.871]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[02:07:14.051 --> 02:07:14.731]  Fluoride.
[02:07:14.931 --> 02:07:17.212]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[02:07:17.372 --> 02:07:23.173]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[02:07:23.433 --> 02:07:26.273]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table.
[02:07:26.373 --> 02:07:28.233]  And the results are on record.
[02:07:28.353 --> 02:07:34.474]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[02:07:34.675 --> 02:07:36.835]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[02:07:37.095 --> 02:07:39.715]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[02:07:40.015 --> 02:07:43.416]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[02:07:43.536 --> 02:07:48.119]  You will find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:07:48.959 --> 02:07:53.762]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.

[02:08:03.649 --> 02:08:05.570]  You are obsolete, Mr. Wordsworth.
[02:08:06.050 --> 02:08:06.510]  A lie!
[02:08:06.930 --> 02:08:08.651]  No man is obsolete!
[02:08:08.931 --> 02:08:10.772]  You have no function, Mr. Wordsworth.
[02:08:10.812 --> 02:08:13.713]  You're an anachronism, like a ghost from another time.
[02:08:14.053 --> 02:08:19.156]  I am nothing more than a reminder to you that you cannot destroy truth by burning pages.
[02:08:19.516 --> 02:08:22.277]  You're a bug, Mr. Wordsworth, a crawling insect.
[02:08:22.937 --> 02:08:26.739]  An ugly, misformed little creature who has no purpose here, no meaning!
[02:08:27.340 --> 02:08:28.480]  I am a human being!
[02:08:28.861 --> 02:08:31.282]  Words, Mr. Wordsworth!
[02:08:31.922 --> 02:08:34.204]  They have no substance and no dimension!
[02:08:34.604 --> 02:08:36.065]  Like air, like the wind!
[02:08:36.605 --> 02:08:37.345]  I don't care!
[02:08:37.746 --> 02:08:38.786]  I tell you, I don't care!
[02:08:39.327 --> 02:08:40.908]  I'm a human being, I exist!
[02:08:40.988 --> 02:08:45.130]  And if I speak one thought aloud, that thought lives!
[02:08:45.851 --> 02:08:47.791]  Even after I'm shoveled into my grave!
[02:08:48.052 --> 02:08:50.752]  Delusions, Mr. Wordsworth!
[02:08:51.192 --> 02:08:58.634]  Delusions that you inject into your veins to make you think you have a strength when you have no strength at all!
[02:08:58.894 --> 02:09:04.275]  You have nothing but spindly limbs and a dream, and the state has no use for your kind!
[02:09:05.956 --> 02:09:09.456]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:09:10.036 --> 02:09:11.777]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:09:17.631 --> 02:09:35.386]  Ladies and gentlemen, you can undoubtedly say, worldwide, one man, above all others, stands for the individual and anti-force collectivism, and that is former congressman, medical doctor, Air Force veteran, Dr. Ron Paul.
[02:09:35.886 --> 02:09:40.450]  And he joins us for the next 20 minutes or so to cover the waterfront.
[02:09:40.750 --> 02:09:44.373]  I intended to ask him about Syria and the victory we've had.
[02:09:45.174 --> 02:09:46.254]  That was my first question.
[02:09:46.294 --> 02:09:52.436]  The victory we've had in backing off an expansion of war and the Russians threatening nuclear war over it.
[02:09:52.976 --> 02:09:54.496]  And I said, sir, what would you like to cover first?
[02:09:54.536 --> 02:09:55.496]  And he said Syria.
[02:09:55.756 --> 02:09:57.217]  So we're on the same page.
[02:09:57.737 --> 02:10:01.518]  Then we're going to get into the attack on the Realty Party that he helped found a decade ago.
[02:10:02.478 --> 02:10:06.879]  His movement grew into the Proto Tea Party about eight years ago in his first run for president.
[02:10:08.456 --> 02:10:10.798]  Well, it was his second run, but you know, the first modern run.
[02:10:11.279 --> 02:10:12.800]  And he joins us now.
[02:10:12.900 --> 02:10:15.983]  RonPaulChannel.com has a lot of amazing guests.
[02:10:16.043 --> 02:10:18.145]  Very excited to tell folks about that.
[02:10:18.265 --> 02:10:21.728]  More Liberty Media to displace the dying dinosaur media.
[02:10:22.008 --> 02:10:25.652]  We're going to talk about the future of the controlled media, the attack on the Internet as well.
[02:10:25.672 --> 02:10:26.793]  We're going to cover the waterfront.
[02:10:26.813 --> 02:10:29.215]  But first, sir, you said you want to talk about Syria.
[02:10:29.535 --> 02:10:33.139]  So please give us, Dr. Paul, your take on that.
[02:10:34.039 --> 02:10:36.061]  Well, I hope it's good news.
[02:10:36.141 --> 02:10:37.362]  So far, so good.
[02:10:37.382 --> 02:10:42.386]  The people spoke out because they've been listening to programs like yours and a lot of other ones.
[02:10:42.866 --> 02:10:49.051]  And the people spoke out when the President decided that he would come to Congress and get permission to start bombing Syria.
[02:10:49.732 --> 02:10:56.077]  And the American people evidently said, we've had enough wars, we don't want it, and we're not going to let our Congressmen vote for it.
[02:10:56.137 --> 02:10:58.839]  So he knew he couldn't win the vote, so he backed off.
[02:10:59.139 --> 02:11:01.301]  So they had to back off on the bombing.
[02:11:01.761 --> 02:11:03.984]  So I think this is a victory.
[02:11:04.024 --> 02:11:06.106]  Does this mean that he has changed his tune?
[02:11:06.587 --> 02:11:07.468]  Probably not.
[02:11:07.508 --> 02:11:09.390]  He's still very much involved.
[02:11:09.631 --> 02:11:13.595]  He's put out an open hand, you know, to the Iranians.
[02:11:13.675 --> 02:11:14.657]  I think that is good.
[02:11:15.057 --> 02:11:19.743]  So although I am not certain about where he's coming from finally,
[02:11:20.283 --> 02:11:26.527]  You know, when there's a chance to at least say, well, he's doing the right thing, we shouldn't say, well, we don't want him to do that.
[02:11:26.987 --> 02:11:29.389]  I want, you know, a different type of foreign policy.
[02:11:29.449 --> 02:11:31.390]  And so far, I think we're seeing it.
[02:11:31.710 --> 02:11:38.995]  But, you know, today there was something in the news I thought was important and it's related to this, and that is the American government now has said,
[02:11:39.535 --> 02:11:46.740]  You know, we're going to cut off non-lethal help and aid to the Syrian rebels.
[02:11:47.160 --> 02:11:48.060]  Lo and behold!
[02:11:48.240 --> 02:11:50.782]  I mean, can you imagine how long this has been going on?
[02:11:50.802 --> 02:11:53.183]  A long time before we even knew about our involvement.
[02:11:53.203 --> 02:11:55.065]  You know, the CIA has been involved there a long time.
[02:11:55.425 --> 02:11:57.666]  But to cut off non-lethal aid, is it good?
[02:11:57.926 --> 02:11:59.747]  But why did we send it in the first place?
[02:11:59.827 --> 02:12:02.149]  And does that mean they're still going to send lethal aid?
[02:12:02.689 --> 02:12:08.732]  And he assures us that they're going to continue to send humanitarian aid, which is nothing more than a weapon for these factions.
[02:12:09.212 --> 02:12:23.859]  So he's moving in the right direction, but we need to move right a lot faster, because my position has been that we just shouldn't be involved at all in this whole pretense that we're helping the good guys over there, and yet the weapons end up in the hands of the Al-Qaeda.
[02:12:24.160 --> 02:12:25.640]  At least they're recognizing that.
[02:12:25.680 --> 02:12:31.143]  Not only did he back off on the bombing, he's recognizing that, yes, some of us who said don't send the weapons,
[02:12:31.483 --> 02:12:31.904]  I think so.
[02:12:48.666 --> 02:13:06.688]  Well, it's very exciting, Dr. Paul, and I want to get your take on this because it ties into the media, that they said we've got to go to war, it's going to happen, they launched the sarin gas attack, aka the Syrian government Assad, and then now Sy Hersh has come out with documents that it was really the Syrian
[02:13:07.749 --> 02:13:09.970]  Opposition that did it back by the West.
[02:13:10.010 --> 02:13:12.251]  Of course, we broke that first with Roland Daly and others.
[02:13:12.711 --> 02:13:14.071]  Grudge Report carried our articles.
[02:13:14.892 --> 02:13:16.152]  And of course, we got attacked for it.
[02:13:16.192 --> 02:13:20.754]  Your son got attacked valiantly in the Senate for daring to point out that we're funding Al-Qaeda.
[02:13:21.274 --> 02:13:28.116]  But overnight now, it's admitted and suddenly we don't ever hear about Syria in the news anymore.
[02:13:28.416 --> 02:13:33.318]  From imminent, we've got to have war, to let's not talk about it, and we've stopped.
[02:13:34.078 --> 02:13:35.439]  This criminal escalation.
[02:13:35.559 --> 02:13:43.084]  To me, and we're seeing this now on so many fronts, Obamacare, you name it, their wave has been stopped politically.
[02:13:43.104 --> 02:13:47.706]  And I've seen this historically where everything they wanted they got just by weight of inertia.
[02:13:48.287 --> 02:13:52.509]  Now it looks like we've stopped them and are beginning to turn the tide.
[02:13:52.529 --> 02:13:57.212]  Do you concur or do you add anything to your deep historical perspective?
[02:13:57.352 --> 02:14:09.262]  Well, I concur, and I'm excited about it, and I'm very pleased, and I praise the direction that we're going, and I give the credit to a lot of people who put pressure on their members of Congress, because that's the way the system actually works.
[02:14:09.702 --> 02:14:11.283]  I know that a lot of people get frustrated.
[02:14:11.423 --> 02:14:13.004]  Oh, one person can't do any good.
[02:14:13.045 --> 02:14:14.646]  My member of Congress never listened.
[02:14:15.166 --> 02:14:21.893]  But when enough people send a message, you know, they will listen because they're political animals.
[02:14:22.273 --> 02:14:36.927]  So I see this as being very, very positive, but I'm not convinced that even though the Pew poll showed that now we have 54% of the American people for the first time in 40 years saying that we should be not involved in this kind of activity.
[02:14:37.547 --> 02:14:42.932]  I'm not convinced that the American people are quite with us, but they're so much better than they were.
[02:14:42.952 --> 02:14:47.496]  Some of them are just saying, well, we're running out of money, let's spend all this money on welfare here at home.
[02:14:47.876 --> 02:14:52.260]  But you know, the first step of just stopping this overseas is a big, big help.
[02:14:52.721 --> 02:14:59.407]  And therefore, I'm cautiously optimistic, and everybody knows I spend a lot of time on college campuses, and believe me,
[02:14:59.927 --> 02:15:05.973]  Reaching young people is important and the young people do not want to have another war to inherit.
[02:15:05.993 --> 02:15:17.906]  They have enough problems and enough, you know, things that they have to face that they've been given, you know, by a previous generation, you know, including the death and the mess in medical care and all this military intervention.
[02:15:17.926 --> 02:15:22.430]  So one thing for sure, the message I hear in college campuses, we don't need another war.
[02:15:22.570 --> 02:15:22.991]  That's good.
[02:15:24.187 --> 02:15:29.369]  Again, libertarian, patriot, constitutionalist icon, Ron Paul joins us.
[02:15:29.409 --> 02:15:31.030]  The website, of course, is excellent.
[02:15:31.050 --> 02:15:32.050]  The shows are amazing.
[02:15:32.430 --> 02:15:38.293]  I'm a big fan of ronpaulchannel.com, and it is supplanting the mainstream media and all over talk radio now.
[02:15:38.733 --> 02:15:48.817]  I do affiliate interviews every other day, and so many times when I'm on a local station, I was on one in Knoxville just yesterday and heard during the news break them play your two-minute analysis.
[02:15:48.897 --> 02:15:53.619]  It's just excellent and hard-hitting and absolutely pertinent to what's happening.
[02:15:54.139 --> 02:15:56.581]  Looking at targeting young people.
[02:15:56.821 --> 02:15:58.642]  We're targeting to take the blinders off.
[02:15:59.063 --> 02:16:09.350]  Obama's targeting them with the Obamacare to dumb them down, which I believe was designed to fail, and they now admit that, to bankrupt the old system and bring in single payer.
[02:16:09.670 --> 02:16:11.291]  Now Colin Powell's getting behind that.
[02:16:11.312 --> 02:16:15.935]  Boehner, John Boehner, or whatever his name is, the Speaker of the House, is coming out
[02:16:16.275 --> 02:16:31.083]  Shane, it's ridiculous that Tea Party Republicans in the House and Senate, led by Ted Cruz and your son, Senator Rand Paul, would not want to have a bigger budget when they boosted $60 billion, cut it $20 billion, rearranging deck chairs in the Titanic.
[02:16:34.024 --> 02:16:46.893]  I see the Republican and Democratic leadership, with Karl Rove and others, really trying to destroy a true libertarian movement in the Republican Party that you've helped forge with the groups that you've set up, the Campaign for Liberty and others.
[02:16:46.933 --> 02:16:48.334]  We're trying to save this country.
[02:16:48.754 --> 02:16:56.759]  What do we do to get on the offense, to once and for all remove these rhino statists out of the Republican Party?
[02:16:56.779 --> 02:16:59.601]  Because they admit they're scared that we could take over.
[02:17:00.134 --> 02:17:03.175]  Well, I think we're making progress because the alignment has changed.
[02:17:04.036 --> 02:17:08.757]  You know, when these budget agreements come up, you know, it's leadership of both parties that get together.
[02:17:09.238 --> 02:17:13.219]  But the grassroots, you know, on both sides frequently get together.
[02:17:13.479 --> 02:17:15.700]  That's what happened on the bombing.
[02:17:15.840 --> 02:17:17.621]  You know, the leadership, Republican and Democrat,
[02:17:18.041 --> 02:17:18.642]  We're good to go.
[02:17:40.564 --> 02:17:45.366]  But we had every Republican vote for it and we had a lot more Democrats vote for it too.
[02:17:45.626 --> 02:17:48.487]  But this comes from a coalition of the people.
[02:17:48.948 --> 02:18:03.854]  So I think it's, I think the most important thing is changing people's attitudes and hopefully issues like war, issues of NSA spying, issues of the Fed, they transcend some of this party stuff.
[02:18:04.354 --> 02:18:07.896]  And I love the issues where you can reach both elements.
[02:18:08.696 --> 02:18:12.881]  Uh, you know, that, uh, you know, where we can come together and change policy.
[02:18:13.302 --> 02:18:19.069]  But then there's this power struggle that is so, uh, disruptive to the whole system in Washington.
[02:18:19.089 --> 02:18:26.178]  Uh, even though, uh, they do compromise on the big issue, there's a big fight on who gets to pull the strings and write the checks.
[02:18:27.287 --> 02:18:28.248]  Well, I agree with you.
[02:18:28.408 --> 02:18:32.313]  I would be a Democrat if they had Ron Pauls and Rand Pauls and Ted Cruz in it.
[02:18:32.633 --> 02:18:37.539]  And I would love to take over the Democratic Party with American free market ideas.
[02:18:38.540 --> 02:18:44.266]  Separately, as you know, there's scapegoating capitalism for the problems we're in when it's purely crony capitalism.
[02:18:45.751 --> 02:18:54.738]  How do you see us winning that fight, Dr. Paul, for the hearts and minds as things collapse into collectivism that you've always predicted?
[02:18:55.158 --> 02:19:00.322]  You have said many times that the crisis is they'll offer more collectivism as the answer.
[02:19:00.703 --> 02:19:06.948]  How do we reverse this QE unlimited, what's happening with the economy?
[02:19:07.008 --> 02:19:12.072]  How do we explain to people that it's insider groups doing this, not the free market?
[02:19:12.816 --> 02:19:13.837]  Well, there's no easy way.
[02:19:13.877 --> 02:19:19.622]  We have to keep plugging away, and that is getting information out there, which that's your business, and that's been my goal.
[02:19:19.642 --> 02:19:28.090]  And if you change the prevailing attitudes of the people, you will change the attitudes of people in Congress.
[02:19:28.630 --> 02:19:29.851]  But it's been helpful.
[02:19:29.891 --> 02:19:40.755]  There's been a couple things going on here in these last five years, and I especially noticed it during the presidential campaigns that I was involved in, and that is communications are different now.
[02:19:40.835 --> 02:19:42.515]  Your communications are not average.
[02:19:42.535 --> 02:19:43.716]  You're not Fox News.
[02:19:43.756 --> 02:19:46.677]  You know, you communicate with a lot of people, but it's differently.
[02:19:46.957 --> 02:19:48.217]  So we have the internet.
[02:19:48.257 --> 02:19:50.638]  We have radio programming that's independent.
[02:19:51.039 --> 02:19:54.600]  So that vehicle is available to us like never before.
[02:19:55.240 --> 02:20:00.425]  But also, the evident failure of the system is so clear.
[02:20:01.406 --> 02:20:07.612]  So we look at it and say, yeah, the foreign policy of the Middle East is a disaster.
[02:20:07.632 --> 02:20:08.753]  Let's slow it down.
[02:20:08.773 --> 02:20:13.297]  So this information has gone out, and we can use that to our benefit.
[02:20:13.317 --> 02:20:15.099]  So I think it's going to be the failure of the system.
[02:20:15.519 --> 02:20:23.402]  I think the question that you might be raising here is, yes, we know it isn't working and we know things are going to come down, but what will the results be?
[02:20:23.442 --> 02:20:32.364]  And that's still up for grabs, although we can look at some areas that are very positive and we can be optimistic, but that is the bottom line.
[02:20:32.404 --> 02:20:33.785]  You know, who gets blamed?
[02:20:34.025 --> 02:20:39.987]  Will it be capitalism in the good sense, or will it be crony capitalism that gets the blame?
[02:20:40.407 --> 02:20:48.250]  You know, we have these Wall Street demonstrators, but they're always complaining.
[02:20:48.270 --> 02:20:52.872]  It should be shown that they're against crony capitalism, not free capitalism.
[02:20:53.172 --> 02:20:58.274]  It's an educational effort, and I think the opportunity is there, the opportunity to spread the message.
[02:20:58.674 --> 02:21:07.078]  At the same time, the failure of the system is going to play into our hands, because there has to be a need, there has to be a replacement.
[02:21:07.438 --> 02:21:07.838]  That's right.
[02:21:37.558 --> 02:21:40.020]  We've only got about four minutes left with you, and I appreciate your time.
[02:21:40.301 --> 02:21:42.903]  Let me throw this out at you, then, since you mentioned dictators.
[02:21:42.923 --> 02:21:53.852]  That reminds me, they're finally having congressional hearings, as I'm sure you know, as a newshound, with Jonathan Turley on the left and Kato Institute people on the right, saying Obama pretty much has become a dictator.
[02:21:53.892 --> 02:22:05.482]  Doesn't mean he's physically a dictator, will stay in office, but they're making the office dictatorial on immigration, on Obamacare, which they created across the board on power plants
[02:22:06.062 --> 02:22:08.583]  What do we do about repudiating Obama?
[02:22:08.603 --> 02:22:15.247]  Because if we just let him sail off into the sunset and don't impeach him or don't repudiate it, it sets that precedent that you just mentioned.
[02:22:15.267 --> 02:22:17.148]  What do we do about dictatorship?
[02:22:17.168 --> 02:22:19.049]  And then separately, give me your take on Obamacare.
[02:22:19.730 --> 02:22:28.480]  Well, Obamacare, I mean, we can dismiss that rather easily as a total disaster, and the medical care that you will get is no better than the computers that he has been working with.
[02:22:29.041 --> 02:22:37.590]  But, you know, the dictatorship is a very real thing, but I don't see it as limited to Obama, because when you look at what has happened,
[02:22:39.372 --> 02:22:45.378]  You know, with the attack on civil liberties, the spying and the covert war, they're as Republican as Democrats.
[02:22:45.639 --> 02:22:47.941]  What about the National Defense Authorization Act?
[02:22:47.981 --> 02:22:51.545]  That was under, you know, another administration.
[02:22:51.565 --> 02:22:55.209]  And we have this idea of assassination.
[02:22:56.269 --> 02:22:59.372]  This too often is bipartisan.
[02:22:59.792 --> 02:23:14.061]  Yes, if you want to tag it on and show what's happening with Obama, that is fine, but I think we're going to accept the dictatorship that is elected because people say, well, no, he's going to announce for a third term and he's going to be a dictator.
[02:23:14.341 --> 02:23:15.822]  I don't think that's going to happen.
[02:23:15.842 --> 02:23:21.966]  I think the American people would, it would shake the American people finally, and I think it would serve our interests.
[02:23:22.967 --> 02:23:26.028]  That doesn't mean that we will have a less dictatorial government.
[02:23:26.349 --> 02:23:27.429]  Oh, I totally agree.
[02:23:27.469 --> 02:23:35.833]  So we now have a kind of a dictatorial bureaucracy and a system that has just set the precedent to get away with whatever they want.
[02:23:35.853 --> 02:23:36.513]  So let me ask you this.
[02:23:36.753 --> 02:23:38.374]  How do we reverse that A briefly?
[02:23:39.094 --> 02:23:41.855]  Give me your take on where you think Obamacare is going now.
[02:23:42.095 --> 02:23:43.676]  Then I have one more question for you, Dr. Paul.
[02:23:44.102 --> 02:23:54.768]  Okay, well I think Obamacare probably is going to limp into existence, and that the election next year will show that it wasn't very popular, and they'll probably back off a little bit.
[02:23:55.169 --> 02:24:05.875]  But even if Republicans have more control next year, they're not going to get rid of the whole thing, and they're not going to take a principled stand of questioning why should the government be involved at all.
[02:24:06.335 --> 02:24:10.158]  So as bad as it is now, and as bad as Obama is trying to make it,
[02:24:11.258 --> 02:24:18.641]  I think that not a whole lot is going to happen for the long-term future until after the next election.
[02:24:18.701 --> 02:24:26.904]  And I think, hopefully, they'll at least allow individuals to opt out of the system and then say, all I want is to be able to take care of myself.
[02:24:27.224 --> 02:24:29.425]  A big, big request in a free society.
[02:24:29.765 --> 02:24:38.349]  So I think that it doesn't look good on the long run, but at least maybe it'll get improved a little bit after next year's election.
[02:24:38.869 --> 02:24:46.151]  Sure, or Rand Paul's bill to make Congress, the House and Senate, live under the same laws they passed for us.
[02:24:46.191 --> 02:24:49.032]  I mean, for me, that's major discrimination that they're exempt.
[02:24:49.072 --> 02:24:50.193]  I know you pushed against that.
[02:24:50.553 --> 02:24:52.934]  And speaking of that, here are the two final points that go together.
[02:24:53.634 --> 02:25:03.957]  Former Reagan advisor David Stockham, a top economist, told Bloomberg earlier in the week that every market valuation has lost every anchor to the real world.
[02:25:04.037 --> 02:25:05.538]  That sounds like Ron Paul talking.
[02:25:06.719 --> 02:25:12.566]  A lot of economists say the big event has to happen by the middle of next year with all this QA unlimited, with the bubble bursting.
[02:25:13.186 --> 02:25:16.750]  What do you think is happening in the real economy with all this fiat?
[02:25:17.852 --> 02:25:21.276]  And then what's the word on your son running for president?
[02:25:23.287 --> 02:25:29.013]  You know, I think in the real world, the economy is a lot worse than people, you know, think.
[02:25:29.053 --> 02:25:31.035]  Of course, the people who are suffering, they know darn well.
[02:25:31.315 --> 02:25:40.505]  And that's the bottom one-third, at least, because, you know, if you look at the workforce, only 61% of the workforce are employed.
[02:25:40.525 --> 02:25:44.689]  So more than a third of the people are essentially unemployed or having a terrible time.
[02:25:45.009 --> 02:25:45.870]  We're good to go.
[02:26:01.459 --> 02:26:06.122]  By Austrian economics that this would happen and middle class would be destroyed.
[02:26:06.162 --> 02:26:10.644]  But that's going to lead to, you know, a lot of political problems as well.
[02:26:11.265 --> 02:26:13.066]  Economic problems lead to political problems.
[02:26:13.406 --> 02:26:16.067]  The whole thing, well, who's going to get blamed for it?
[02:26:16.307 --> 02:26:18.448]  Will freedom and the free market be blamed?
[02:26:18.809 --> 02:26:20.450]  Or will it be too much government?
[02:26:20.510 --> 02:26:26.333]  Will it be Obama-type Obamacare and big government and big government spying?
[02:26:26.373 --> 02:26:28.594]  Are they going to get the blame?
[02:26:29.234 --> 02:26:32.956]  And that's still our job, and we have a lot of work to do.
[02:26:33.816 --> 02:26:40.179]  Now obviously you're going to let him answer this, but I mean undoubtedly if we show support, I think your son's hands down the best candidate.
[02:26:40.539 --> 02:26:56.946]  I'd like to see a Rand Paul run for president and a Ted Cruz run for vice president, or I guess you could have a father-son team up, you for president, Rand for vice president, but certainly, I mean as a father, you can't speak for your son, but
[02:26:57.546 --> 02:27:07.514]  As a father, could you ever have imagined that your son could end up being, not just president, but end up being a libertarian president to restore the republic?
[02:27:08.203 --> 02:27:21.454]  Well, it takes some adjustment to think about it, but, you know, he's in a position now, you know, I was toiling in the field for a lot of years and a lot of decades and made some progress.
[02:27:21.714 --> 02:27:25.677]  But I think he's in a much better position now, you know, being in the Senate makes a difference.
[02:27:25.737 --> 02:27:27.999]  I think the freedom movement is much further along.
[02:27:28.039 --> 02:27:32.703]  I think the failure of our economic and foreign policy system is in shambles.
[02:27:33.143 --> 02:27:36.185]  So I think he's in a much better position now to
[02:27:37.046 --> 02:27:44.569]  Play an instrumental role, you know, in whatever he does, whether it's in the Senate or how well he does in the presidential election.
[02:27:44.609 --> 02:27:49.351]  And most people are assuming that's probably, you know, what he'll do.
[02:27:49.712 --> 02:27:56.855]  I'm sure he hasn't made a final decision, even though he hasn't discouraged the discussion about whether or not he might run.
[02:27:57.639 --> 02:28:00.761]  Well, he has just really made us all proud, and I'm so glad I backed him.
[02:28:01.302 --> 02:28:03.063]  He's turned out even better than I imagined.
[02:28:03.103 --> 02:28:08.787]  It's hard to be a total clone off the old block, but I tell you, he really is a statesman.
[02:28:08.807 --> 02:28:10.008]  And God bless you, Dr. Paul.
[02:28:10.028 --> 02:28:11.349]  Look forward to speaking to you again soon.
[02:28:11.589 --> 02:28:11.869]  Very good.
[02:28:11.969 --> 02:28:12.410]  Talk to you soon.
[02:28:12.630 --> 02:28:13.330]  All right, take care.
[02:28:13.931 --> 02:28:18.054]  Wow, there goes former Congressman Ron Paul, and that is very exciting.
[02:28:18.414 --> 02:28:25.219]  And I'll be on his TV radio show on Monday for folks that want to tune into that, and that's at theronpaulchannel.com.
[02:28:28.254 --> 02:28:30.856]  And I tell you, collectivists everywhere hate that person.
[02:28:31.156 --> 02:28:32.717]  Hate that man that you just heard on air.
[02:28:33.798 --> 02:28:38.080]  And I gotta tell you, I'm a little bit proud of the fact that I personally twisted arms behind the scenes.
[02:28:38.361 --> 02:28:39.902]  And Rand Paul's even said this on the show.
[02:28:40.422 --> 02:28:44.325]  I could get Rand Paul on the show, but he goes through a lot of flack with the Republicans and the establishment.
[02:28:44.865 --> 02:28:47.146]  Last time he was on, he called up and said, hey, I want to come on your show.
[02:28:47.166 --> 02:28:48.827]  I haven't talked to him in probably six months.
[02:28:48.847 --> 02:28:50.509]  I need to call him up privately and talk to him.
[02:28:51.469 --> 02:28:52.891]  Uh, because it's good to have controversy.
[02:28:52.911 --> 02:28:56.136]  I think it'd probably be good for him to come on and have MSNBC attack him for coming on here.
[02:28:56.156 --> 02:28:58.079]  You know, you go on that crazy person show.
[02:28:58.119 --> 02:29:04.227]  Yeah, the guy that said the NSA was spying on us 15 years ago, or the guy that said they were preparing for war with the American people.
[02:29:04.688 --> 02:29:07.932]  I mean, yeah, I act crazy a lot, folks, because I'm an angry real person.
[02:29:08.613 --> 02:29:20.840]  And I mean, I think we should be acting, quote, crazy about being raped, having our liberties pillaged, financially abused, having a bunch of Marxists and Communists and Socialists and Fascists running rampant all over the place.
[02:29:21.300 --> 02:29:21.920]  I'm upset.
[02:29:22.561 --> 02:29:24.622]  We've got our calm, stately Ron Paul.
[02:29:24.642 --> 02:29:28.224]  We've got the statesmen like Ted Cruz and Rand Paul.
[02:29:28.244 --> 02:29:29.725]  But we need some firebrands.
[02:29:30.498 --> 02:29:31.698]  And believe me, this isn't an act.
[02:29:32.359 --> 02:29:34.359]  I am like this, but I fit in.
[02:29:34.459 --> 02:29:44.623]  And regardless of what color you are, how old you are, where you're from, male, female, Catholic, Christian, whatever you are, Protestant, Muslim, Jewish, it doesn't matter.
[02:29:45.063 --> 02:29:48.864]  Can't we all just agree on justice and liberty and try to restore the Republic?
[02:29:49.144 --> 02:29:49.564]  We'll be back.
[02:29:50.625 --> 02:29:51.545]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.045 --> 02:29:53.206]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.226 --> 02:29:57.467]  With your calls, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:57.487 --> 02:29:57.987]  Straight ahead.
[02:29:58.007 --> 02:29:59.428]  Best Ron Paul interview ever, I think I've done.
[02:29:59.448 --> 02:29:59.868]  I love that.
[02:30:01.428 --> 02:30:04.172]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[02:30:04.433 --> 02:30:09.280]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[02:30:09.461 --> 02:30:16.652]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[02:30:16.772 --> 02:30:22.177]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[02:30:22.397 --> 02:30:26.040]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[02:30:26.421 --> 02:30:30.965]  You've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[02:30:31.145 --> 02:30:36.370]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[02:30:36.590 --> 02:30:39.692]  Strategic Relocation, 3rd Edition by Joel Skousen.
[02:30:39.832 --> 02:30:42.094]  When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.
[02:30:42.354 --> 02:30:46.937]  Therosafe, used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[02:30:47.097 --> 02:30:49.558]  Hand-cranked shortwave AM FM radios.
[02:30:49.999 --> 02:30:57.043]  Everything that we've researched and found to be the best is available at Infowarshop.com and your purchase makes our Infowar possible.
[02:30:57.203 --> 02:30:58.244]  We're getting prepared.
[02:30:58.484 --> 02:30:58.905]  Are you?
[02:30:59.145 --> 02:31:00.245]  Infowarshop.com
[02:31:01.486 --> 02:31:03.128]  Introducing Pro-1.
[02:31:03.368 --> 02:31:06.891]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[02:31:07.031 --> 02:31:11.435]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[02:31:11.595 --> 02:31:17.560]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[02:31:17.680 --> 02:31:28.450]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.
[02:31:28.650 --> 02:31:34.953]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[02:31:35.154 --> 02:31:52.142]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands, and sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[02:31:52.463 --> 02:31:56.905]  Get your Pro-Pure with the new Pro-1 filters today at Infowarstore.com
[02:31:57.105 --> 02:31:57.766]  Or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:32:01.826 --> 02:32:06.928]  Alex Jones here, and I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show, My Patriot Supply.
[02:32:07.308 --> 02:32:15.772]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[02:32:16.192 --> 02:32:23.495]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow Patriots.
[02:32:24.015 --> 02:32:31.418]  My Patriot Supply brings us their exclusive Patriot Pantry brand, along with many other fine preparedness products.
[02:32:31.918 --> 02:32:35.321]  I personally store and use their high-quality products.
[02:32:35.861 --> 02:32:39.504]  It tastes great, and it's easy to store for up to 25 years.
[02:32:40.065 --> 02:32:46.650]  For a limited time, you can save $50 instantly on a four-week supply of food, along with other special offers.
[02:32:47.211 --> 02:32:53.936]  Visit mypatriotsupply.com forward slash Alex today, with the New World Order making rapid advances on every front.
[02:32:54.416 --> 02:32:58.460]  It is essential to prepare with My Patriot Supply today.
[02:33:11.184 --> 02:33:13.325]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[02:33:13.365 --> 02:33:13.725]  Brilliant.
[02:33:13.845 --> 02:33:16.286]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:33:16.547 --> 02:33:17.287]  I love this song.
[02:33:17.327 --> 02:33:18.908]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:33:19.028 --> 02:33:20.809]  Let's roll some of this summer rage.
[02:33:22.289 --> 02:33:25.091]  Chaos is hanging around.
[02:33:26.371 --> 02:33:28.512]  Put your ear to the ground.
[02:33:28.532 --> 02:33:30.873]  And shut up from the sound.
[02:33:30.933 --> 02:33:31.854]  The death machine.
[02:33:31.914 --> 02:33:35.315]  The death machine ain't slowing down.
[02:33:35.796 --> 02:33:36.456]  It's gaining ground.
[02:33:48.925 --> 02:33:51.747]  Best part right here.
[02:34:21.777 --> 02:34:30.604]  Alright, I'm gonna go to your phone calls here and I'm gonna try to shut up until you make your point and move to the next person.
[02:34:30.684 --> 02:34:31.465]  I'll never get to anybody.
[02:34:35.268 --> 02:34:38.931]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jody in North Carolina.
[02:34:39.111 --> 02:34:39.911]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:34:39.931 --> 02:34:42.673]  Hey Alex, can you hear me?
[02:34:43.114 --> 02:34:43.714]  Yes, I can.
[02:34:43.774 --> 02:34:44.435]  Thank you for calling.
[02:34:45.322 --> 02:34:46.002]  Yes, sir.
[02:34:46.582 --> 02:34:52.925]  I'm from North Carolina, so I just wanted to let you know that North Carolina, the way I was raised, we say thank you anyway.
[02:34:53.165 --> 02:34:59.007]  I know you don't want to say that, but I also wanted you to know that I'm also a simple war hound.
[02:34:59.087 --> 02:35:02.708]  I'm out here constantly, you know, doing my research and studying.
[02:35:03.348 --> 02:35:10.771]  At first, when I first heard about you, I'm a first-time caller, but I heard about you about a year ago from a friend of mine.
[02:35:12.048 --> 02:35:13.189]  I decided to check you out.
[02:35:13.249 --> 02:35:19.392]  I've been growing up on a little bit of Rush Limbaugh, a little bit of Glenn Beck and others and a little bit of Savage Nation.
[02:35:19.432 --> 02:35:21.513]  But I listen to your show.
[02:35:21.573 --> 02:35:22.434]  I'm a truck driver.
[02:35:22.494 --> 02:35:23.855]  I drive up and down these highways.
[02:35:23.955 --> 02:35:27.617]  I do in-home delivery out of High Point, North Carolina.
[02:35:28.837 --> 02:35:31.319]  And just wanted to let you know, man, that I'm out here.
[02:35:31.339 --> 02:35:33.180]  I'll let these customers know about you.
[02:35:33.280 --> 02:35:37.002]  After my research, outside of God, I believe in you, brother.
[02:35:37.042 --> 02:35:38.002]  I believe in your cause.
[02:35:38.923 --> 02:35:40.744]  I've believed it for 10 years myself.
[02:35:41.348 --> 02:35:53.679]  Before I found you, which is kind of like a blessing in my life because you opened up a whole new perspective on things that I had overlooked because I was also dumbed down with this mainstream media and society.
[02:35:53.839 --> 02:36:01.165]  And after opening up everything and kind of just revealing your Pandora's box and what was going on, I see it was the truth.
[02:36:02.378 --> 02:36:05.302]  I think the hardest thing for me is trying to go to my family members.
[02:36:06.404 --> 02:36:10.029]  God, it seems like they're the ones that don't want to believe in it.
[02:36:10.209 --> 02:36:11.030]  Oh, listen, brother.
[02:36:11.150 --> 02:36:11.971]  I know the feeling.
[02:36:13.133 --> 02:36:16.077]  I'll be around family members and people that aren't really listeners.
[02:36:17.256 --> 02:36:26.698]  And they're nice folks and they're somewhat awake compared to the average person, but you almost feel like you're doing bad things to tell them about bad stuff that's happening.
[02:36:27.418 --> 02:36:30.519]  It's almost like impolite, but we don't have a future if we don't.
[02:36:31.219 --> 02:36:34.180]  We owe it to them to admit just how bad things are.
[02:36:35.140 --> 02:36:45.562]  Because, again, as good people, or as just folks that aren't overtly evil, none of us are perfect, we are blind to just how bad bad people are and that
[02:36:47.338 --> 02:36:48.678]  It's limitless what they'll do.
[02:36:49.658 --> 02:36:53.439]  So I totally understand what you're saying and what you're getting at.
[02:36:53.619 --> 02:36:59.741]  And that's why I personally, I don't really beat family over the head with this info if they don't already know what's going on.
[02:36:59.761 --> 02:37:05.322]  I reach out to folks just randomly everywhere and tell them what's happening.
[02:37:05.342 --> 02:37:06.282]  And it's certainly working.
[02:37:06.322 --> 02:37:08.022]  There is an undoubted awakening happening.
[02:37:08.042 --> 02:37:13.784]  And Ron Paul concurs, I think the first time ever, he said we're getting close to a turning the tide or close to a tipping point.
[02:37:14.144 --> 02:37:15.424]  He now thinks we're right there.
[02:37:16.597 --> 02:37:18.918]  And I agree with Dr. Paul, who's a pretty smart cookie.
[02:37:18.958 --> 02:37:21.318]  So what else did you want to throw out there, Jody?
[02:37:21.338 --> 02:37:26.259]  I appreciate you promoting the show to folks, because that's how we're going to expose these people.
[02:37:27.340 --> 02:37:28.260]  Absolutely, sir.
[02:37:28.420 --> 02:37:28.900]  I agree 100%.
[02:37:29.540 --> 02:37:33.001]  I just want to let you know also that I go to customers' homes every day.
[02:37:33.301 --> 02:37:37.322]  I deal with 40, 50 customers every trip.
[02:37:37.382 --> 02:37:39.643]  I'm all over this country, all 48 states.
[02:37:40.143 --> 02:37:43.924]  So I get to see a lot of these things you're talking about as I'm doing my travels here.
[02:37:45.626 --> 02:37:48.388]  And I have noticed how, you know, things are changing.
[02:37:48.428 --> 02:37:52.430]  I've been looking out for the armored vehicles, the things like that, the sheriff's departments and things.
[02:37:52.510 --> 02:37:53.330]  I go through Dallas.
[02:37:53.390 --> 02:37:54.871]  I lived in Dallas for three years.
[02:37:54.971 --> 02:37:56.312]  Man, I love Texas.
[02:37:56.432 --> 02:37:59.954]  If I ever retire, I told my wife, that's where I want to live at.
[02:37:59.994 --> 02:38:01.855]  Would love to live right next door to you.
[02:38:02.315 --> 02:38:03.595]  Man, you're like my biggest hero.
[02:38:03.655 --> 02:38:08.038]  But anyway, outside of that stuff, I just want to say,
[02:38:10.323 --> 02:38:18.826]  Maybe you could tell me how I could convince my wife, who's an intelligent woman, 4.0 GPA, graduated high honors.
[02:38:19.367 --> 02:38:20.347]  She's in the medical field.
[02:38:20.407 --> 02:38:25.989]  I do science research study on like the first stage one, phase one of... Now I get it.
[02:38:26.009 --> 02:38:26.870]  She's a smart lady.
[02:38:28.170 --> 02:38:29.191]  What should I convince her of?
[02:38:30.474 --> 02:38:48.490]  Well, I just wanted to know if you had 30 seconds to tell my wife or to try to convince my wife of what's going on in our country today and to really wake up and be a part of my team and the InfoWar team, the team that's striving for the truth and the right direction, what would you say?
[02:38:48.510 --> 02:38:50.372]  Alright, well I appreciate your call.
[02:38:50.392 --> 02:38:52.053]  Let me just say this to your wife, Jodi.
[02:38:52.093 --> 02:38:52.714]  Thank you, Jodi.
[02:38:54.472 --> 02:38:59.215]  I can't make her do research on the topics we're covering.
[02:38:59.676 --> 02:39:15.666]  And I notice a lot of professionals that are really smart are some of the hardest people to wake up to this because they know there's problems in society but they see it as almost positive that they overlook all that and just move forward and take care of business as Elvis Presley would say.
[02:39:16.547 --> 02:39:22.211]  And you certainly have to take care of business and you can't let all this tyranny get you down and stop you from living a life.
[02:39:23.134 --> 02:39:30.700]  But you've got to understand historically, when corruption builds to this level, it brings down civilizations and horrible tragedies happen.
[02:39:31.221 --> 02:39:33.963]  And tyranny is a norm in history, not an exception.
[02:39:34.404 --> 02:39:39.027]  And we've got a really bad batch of tyranny cooking up in the kitchen.
[02:39:39.648 --> 02:39:40.849]  And it needs to be thrown out.
[02:39:42.330 --> 02:39:51.298]  And so, I understand statistically that husbands and wives don't listen to each other as much as they'd listen to a random salesman at the door.
[02:39:52.936 --> 02:39:57.517]  And so I guess I'm a random salesman at the door selling freedom.
[02:39:58.938 --> 02:40:12.322]  And I would just say to Jody's wife that there's so much admitted evil by the criminals that hide in government and major corporations that if I tried to just list a few things, it would make my head spin.
[02:40:12.382 --> 02:40:15.923]  I mean, there's thousands of declassified, and I use this a lot because everybody knows this,
[02:40:17.432 --> 02:40:23.314]  Lethal studies that were killing people carried out by our government right through the last decade.
[02:40:24.355 --> 02:40:25.015]  From the 30s.
[02:40:26.316 --> 02:40:27.976]  And no one ever got in trouble for any of it.
[02:40:28.657 --> 02:40:35.299]  And that's because there's a eugenicist-based power structure hiding within Western governments.
[02:40:35.439 --> 02:40:40.441]  Hitler was only one eruption of that that went too far for even the establishment.
[02:40:41.222 --> 02:40:45.904]  And so, I understand that this stuff's scary and it's easy to just deny it.
[02:40:46.761 --> 02:40:54.588]  But I'll assure you that it is real and that I am actually wrong about a lot of this.
[02:40:54.648 --> 02:40:56.670]  It's worse than I normally have thought.
[02:40:57.230 --> 02:41:00.333]  So it's not that I'm exaggerating.
[02:41:00.974 --> 02:41:01.814]  It's the other way around.
[02:41:02.935 --> 02:41:05.778]  And I wish every day I was wrong, ma'am.
[02:41:06.638 --> 02:41:08.220]  I wish every day this wasn't true.
[02:41:09.221 --> 02:41:11.343]  But I have the textbooks.
[02:41:11.523 --> 02:41:12.404]  I have the documents.
[02:41:13.305 --> 02:41:16.747]  I keep plugging this every day just because it's been on my desk the last few months.
[02:41:16.767 --> 02:41:17.868]  I need to put it back on the bookshelf.
[02:41:17.968 --> 02:41:18.609]  Ecoscience.
[02:41:18.649 --> 02:41:19.489]  It's free online.
[02:41:20.050 --> 02:41:24.673]  It's been scanned online about how they put stuff in the water to reduce our IQ and sterilize us.
[02:41:25.733 --> 02:41:31.457]  The White House regulations are currently talks about, you know, dumbing us down and breaking us up and having us fight with each other.
[02:41:31.477 --> 02:41:32.758]  I mean, these are social engineers.
[02:41:33.479 --> 02:41:36.661]  And you ignore all of this at your own peril.
[02:41:39.563 --> 02:41:41.804]  Dan Bongino, the Secret Service agent,
[02:41:42.913 --> 02:41:50.179]  Senior agent over Obama's foreign trips basically has said it's worse than anyone knows.
[02:41:50.780 --> 02:41:52.641]  He had to sign agreements not to talk about it obviously.
[02:41:54.022 --> 02:42:00.427]  And it is last night I talked to a Secret Service connection.
[02:42:05.592 --> 02:42:06.272]  It doesn't matter.
[02:42:08.129 --> 02:42:09.370]  See, I don't even want to get into this.
[02:42:09.470 --> 02:42:10.491]  It's just so crazy.
[02:42:11.672 --> 02:42:14.414]  I mean, there's a lot of stuff going on.
[02:42:15.315 --> 02:42:16.916]  There's a cult stuff going on.
[02:42:18.677 --> 02:42:19.598]  And we're in trouble.
[02:42:19.778 --> 02:42:20.839]  I mean, that's all I can say.
[02:42:20.879 --> 02:42:25.363]  And ma'am, I know you probably feel like, well, what can you do about it?
[02:42:25.883 --> 02:42:26.904]  So why not just deny it?
[02:42:27.404 --> 02:42:28.605]  And so fine, just deny it.
[02:42:29.126 --> 02:42:35.231]  But down the road, when things get so bad you can't deny it anymore, then at least get your heart right with God.
[02:42:36.238 --> 02:42:37.279]  I said I'd take a lot of calls.
[02:42:37.339 --> 02:42:38.380]  I just spent six, seven minutes.
[02:42:39.080 --> 02:42:40.361]  Seven minutes on that one subject.
[02:42:41.082 --> 02:42:41.602]  Or longer.
[02:42:41.662 --> 02:42:43.564]  Let's go to Wesley real fast in Mississippi.
[02:42:43.604 --> 02:42:43.984]  Go ahead.
[02:42:44.004 --> 02:42:46.286]  Hey Alex.
[02:42:46.807 --> 02:42:50.189]  I want to say that the new coffee and the nice iodine are amazing.
[02:42:50.209 --> 02:42:51.290]  I love the coffee.
[02:42:51.310 --> 02:42:52.471]  I'm actually drinking some right now.
[02:42:54.062 --> 02:42:59.109]  To Jody, if your wife doesn't believe this stuff, it's because she hasn't taken the time to look into this stuff.
[02:42:59.149 --> 02:43:01.652]  That's the only way you can come to that conclusion.
[02:43:01.812 --> 02:43:11.205]  If you take 30 minutes to look into this stuff, research New World Order, research Illuminati, research all this conspiracy, and there's no way you can come away from it without realizing it's the truth.
[02:43:11.849 --> 02:43:16.211]  And I want to commend you, Alex, because there's so many Christians that are blind to this evil.
[02:43:16.831 --> 02:43:26.616]  And yeah, I know you don't like to accept the praise and everything, but at least, I mean, I'm surprised you mentioned stuff like the Nephilim and the Book of Enoch and this stuff, because that's what this stuff is.
[02:43:26.676 --> 02:43:37.201]  That's what Kurzweil and Hugo de Guerras, that's what they're all talking about when they're talking about hybridization and transhumanism and the singularity they're all trying to come to.
[02:43:37.241 --> 02:43:40.223]  They're talking about the same stuff that happened in the days of Noah.
[02:43:41.767 --> 02:43:44.091]  Exactly what it is, because that's what Jesus said.
[02:43:44.151 --> 02:43:46.274]  The days of Noah, that's what it's going to be like.
[02:43:46.615 --> 02:43:50.040]  When the end times come, when his return will be, it's like it wasn't the days of Noah.
[02:43:50.100 --> 02:43:51.242]  What was going on in the days of Noah?
[02:43:51.602 --> 02:43:55.829]  Well, the sons of God were coming down and having sex or trans, you know,
[02:43:56.437 --> 02:44:01.840]  Genetically modifying human beings to create giants, which no church will ever talk about, the giants.
[02:44:01.900 --> 02:44:12.366]  No church ever explains why Goliath was, you know, nine feet tall, while Aga-Bashan was 18 feet tall, while in Amos, they say the Amorites were, you know, the tallest.
[02:44:12.426 --> 02:44:16.689]  No, I know, and that's actually what they all, the occultists now, even mainline literature, believes.
[02:44:17.449 --> 02:44:18.469]  The Anunnaki, all this.
[02:44:18.490 --> 02:44:23.212]  If I don't get into it, but the elite, and I don't cover stuff I can't prove, but you see the movie Prometheus?
[02:44:23.672 --> 02:44:24.592]  That's an Anunnaki.
[02:44:24.992 --> 02:44:26.133]  Nine foot tall guy.
[02:44:26.153 --> 02:44:28.214]  That's what they're telling us we came from.
[02:44:29.273 --> 02:44:35.215]  And, uh, the Bible says no, that's who came here to manipulate us and that's basically, you know, the fallen angels.
[02:44:35.255 --> 02:44:37.396]  And I don't get into all that because the media picks up on it.
[02:44:37.756 --> 02:44:42.017]  I just cover, you look at why they're doing all this engineering, why they think they're God.
[02:44:42.657 --> 02:44:45.918]  The elite are into this themselves.
[02:44:46.358 --> 02:44:48.579]  What's that term that they say we were seeded by aliens?
[02:44:48.959 --> 02:44:51.780]  It's like Harvard even believes and MIT and transpermia.
[02:44:52.320 --> 02:44:53.061]  What's, what's that term?
[02:44:53.801 --> 02:44:54.101]  What is it?
[02:44:55.592 --> 02:44:56.353]  Panspermia.
[02:44:56.373 --> 02:44:58.554]  Yeah, that's in the piece I did with Aaron Dykes.
[02:44:58.614 --> 02:44:59.275]  It's excellent.
[02:45:00.255 --> 02:45:01.696]  On Secrets of Prometheus leaked.
[02:45:02.017 --> 02:45:02.917]  Good to hear from you, sir.
[02:45:03.378 --> 02:45:05.239]  Again, whether that's real or not, that's what they think.
[02:45:05.539 --> 02:45:05.819]  Okay?
[02:45:06.480 --> 02:45:07.801]  Skull and bones, all of it.
[02:45:07.881 --> 02:45:09.982]  And they think they're in touch with these entities.
[02:45:10.663 --> 02:45:15.046]  That's what demon conjuring and all that stuff is, folks, that every culture gets into.
[02:45:15.466 --> 02:45:18.228]  And the demons say, take your kid up on a pyramid and chop their heart out.
[02:45:19.289 --> 02:45:23.632]  Every culture went to kill their kids so these creatures would give them power.
[02:45:23.732 --> 02:45:24.893]  I don't know if that's real or not.
[02:45:25.799 --> 02:45:33.626]  But as a sociologist, as an anthropologist, as an archaeologist, as a lay researcher, I look at this and go, why does every culture do this?
[02:45:34.347 --> 02:45:46.839]  Well, they tell you why in the movie Prometheus, which is a religious tract promoting by the transhumanists that of course they don't think it's evolution and all this Darwin stuff, that we came from this.
[02:45:51.221 --> 02:45:57.826]  And then some bad gods were going to come back and destroy the Earth because they'd mixed their genetics with us and they didn't like that.
[02:45:58.466 --> 02:46:00.147]  But the good aliens stopped it all.
[02:46:00.167 --> 02:46:04.951]  I mean, they're just telling you the story of the devil and the snake and all of it in that movie.
[02:46:05.491 --> 02:46:06.732]  Super heavy, folks.
[02:46:07.332 --> 02:46:08.213]  Super heavy.
[02:46:09.694 --> 02:46:11.215]  I don't know if any of this is real.
[02:46:11.695 --> 02:46:14.157]  I know the Federal Reserve is private and they tell me it's governmental.
[02:46:16.499 --> 02:46:17.599]  By the way, he mentioned it.
[02:46:17.639 --> 02:46:19.581]  Look, I've got to fund my operation.
[02:46:21.491 --> 02:46:22.193]  I need fuel.
[02:46:22.253 --> 02:46:27.884]  It's expensive to build an operation like this and we need capital in case we get sued or attacked to defend ourselves.
[02:46:27.984 --> 02:46:31.571]  You've done that so we can expand in the face of the new world order fearlessly.
[02:46:31.771 --> 02:46:32.613]  Thank you for your prayers.
[02:46:33.716 --> 02:46:37.240]  I, my favorite brand of coffee, took me years to find out how to get it directly from the farmers.
[02:46:37.761 --> 02:46:38.401]  We put it out.
[02:46:39.062 --> 02:46:40.223]  Everybody that tries it loves it.
[02:46:40.704 --> 02:46:48.532]  It's a medium roast, high mountain, arabica, shade grown, and it's even better than Guatemalan.
[02:46:48.552 --> 02:46:49.613]  Guatemalan been my favorite.
[02:46:49.954 --> 02:46:55.340]  Go over the border, the Mexican's even better, they think, because the soils aren't played out, and it's grown totally organically.
[02:46:56.676 --> 02:47:01.842]  Infowarslife.com for our two different Patriot blends, including the one with mushrooms for immune boost.
[02:47:02.623 --> 02:47:06.807]  It's very fairly priced for a pound of this lightly or medium roast coffee.
[02:47:07.268 --> 02:47:09.370]  We've got it without the mushrooms and with the mushrooms.
[02:47:09.851 --> 02:47:10.471]  It's excellent.
[02:47:11.385 --> 02:47:13.247]  Most of the coffee gives me headaches or heartburn.
[02:47:13.327 --> 02:47:14.168]  That's the reason I like this.
[02:47:14.208 --> 02:47:15.349]  It doesn't give me headaches or heartburn.
[02:47:15.669 --> 02:47:17.251]  I don't know why it's my favorite coffee.
[02:47:17.931 --> 02:47:24.558]  I never thought about putting out coffee until my wife like five years ago said, you should put up Wake Up America coffee and say Jones for it.
[02:47:25.379 --> 02:47:28.702]  And then I actually tracked down how to get it and did it.
[02:47:29.972 --> 02:47:31.513]  That helps support our operation.
[02:47:32.073 --> 02:47:35.996]  The survival shield, nascent iodine, we have plenty of that in supply.
[02:47:36.016 --> 02:47:42.400]  And you can give it as gifts to your family for detoxifying and protecting from the radiation that goes into the thyroid.
[02:47:42.801 --> 02:47:47.103]  With all this Fukushima garbage, it's more important than ever, and it just really gives me a brain boost.
[02:47:47.464 --> 02:47:48.825]  This is what Dr. Gribbs said it would do.
[02:47:49.265 --> 02:47:49.865]  We have madein1776.com.
[02:47:50.065 --> 02:47:53.768]  It's also on infowarsstore.com with the news.
[02:47:53.868 --> 02:47:55.229]  Limited edition, George Washington.
[02:47:55.929 --> 02:47:57.250]  The answer to 1984 is 1776 bronze and nickel belt buckles.
[02:48:00.672 --> 02:48:03.014]  Uh, that are custom 1 through 500, and then that's it.
[02:48:03.294 --> 02:48:05.775]  We've got the Made in America t-shirts with Liberty messages.
[02:48:06.135 --> 02:48:11.198]  This is just the introductory round of this at madein1776.com.
[02:48:11.698 --> 02:48:16.281]  That just takes you right to the page on the shopping cart that has it, and that's how we fund our operation.
[02:48:16.621 --> 02:48:18.102]  And you can still give it as Christmas gifts.
[02:48:18.562 --> 02:48:22.244]  Last year, we had to have the orders in by the 17th to guarantee delivery in the U.S.
[02:48:22.604 --> 02:48:24.085]  It's by the 19th this year.
[02:48:24.105 --> 02:48:25.966]  You'll get it before Christmas, the day before Christmas.
[02:48:26.446 --> 02:48:29.028]  I recommend you order now, though, to make sure you get it all earlier.
[02:48:29.568 --> 02:48:31.709]  Uh, the apparel, the ball caps, all of it.
[02:48:32.869 --> 02:48:36.310]  Everything at MadeIn1776.com is made in America.
[02:48:36.730 --> 02:48:39.691]  Some of the other stuff's made in South America and, you know, everywhere else.
[02:48:40.551 --> 02:48:44.472]  Uh, I'm not against giving those folks jobs, but the way they have it set up, they can never get out of poverty yet.
[02:48:44.592 --> 02:48:46.393]  So we're moving towards made in America.
[02:48:46.873 --> 02:48:48.133]  Everything at MadeIn1776.com is made in America.
[02:48:50.154 --> 02:48:51.675]  We got golf shirts, you name it.
[02:48:51.695 --> 02:48:58.298]  I mean, we're talking about shirts costing me, I was corrected, $13 to $15 for some of these shirts that we sell for $24.95.
[02:48:58.759 --> 02:49:02.501]  At a store like Dillard's, you'd pay $100 for a golf shirt like this.
[02:49:02.981 --> 02:49:09.724]  So it's premium, designer, made in America, golf shirts, you name it, for $24.95.
[02:49:10.445 --> 02:49:13.526]  You absolutely cannot beat that deal.
[02:49:13.546 --> 02:49:14.647]  Here, scroll down and I'll show them.
[02:49:17.483 --> 02:49:19.047]  By the way, I listed the price on these.
[02:49:19.087 --> 02:49:20.812]  I want to lower the price on those ball caps.
[02:49:20.852 --> 02:49:21.895]  I didn't see that they were that much.
[02:49:22.316 --> 02:49:22.938]  Want to find out how much?
[02:49:23.159 --> 02:49:23.480]  Scroll down.
[02:49:25.939 --> 02:49:27.500]  All right, so there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:49:27.540 --> 02:49:28.801]  I see some of the prices on there.
[02:49:29.401 --> 02:49:42.970]  I'm going to lower some of the prices on those right after the show, because that's not exactly... I get so busy and I run everything around here that I can't make all the decisions, and everybody does a great job, but... I'm going to have the prices on some of those shirts lowered, but they're not even that much compared to what designer stuff is.
[02:49:42.990 --> 02:49:48.694]  In fact, they're about half off, even at the price they are now, but my main mission of putting this out is to take back the culture, too.
[02:49:49.733 --> 02:49:53.576]  I'm seeing so many pro-gun t-shirts around Austin, including our t-shirts.
[02:49:54.316 --> 02:50:04.843]  I went to a Megadeth concert, an Iron Maiden concert a few months ago, and literally, I don't know, 50 to 100 M4s t-shirts, but that wasn't it.
[02:50:04.903 --> 02:50:06.044]  That's not why I got excited.
[02:50:06.484 --> 02:50:09.526]  I saw all these other come and take it in Latin,
[02:50:10.882 --> 02:50:13.284]  Molon Labe shirts, we're going to come out with a bunch of those.
[02:50:14.945 --> 02:50:17.506]  Under the 1776, made in 1776 brand.
[02:50:18.267 --> 02:50:21.589]  I just saw Patriot stuff everywhere and now I go to other cities and see it.
[02:50:21.949 --> 02:50:26.553]  We are really a giant minority that's growing towards being a majority.
[02:50:27.033 --> 02:50:32.116]  I don't care whether you're black or white, old or young, man, I really like it when I see you wearing a Molon Labe shirt.
[02:50:32.797 --> 02:50:33.657]  I identify with you.
[02:50:33.737 --> 02:50:35.118]  We're on the same page.

[02:50:38.328 --> 02:50:40.510]  Just you see, that's the secret to beating the globalists.
[02:50:40.850 --> 02:50:43.893]  They want a fake collectivism of race or all this stuff.
[02:50:44.193 --> 02:50:48.156]  How about an individual collectivism of individuals coming together for liberty?
[02:50:48.957 --> 02:50:50.078]  And so that's what this is all about.
[02:50:50.158 --> 02:50:50.618]  Madein1776.com or 888-253-3139.

[02:54:08.406 --> 02:54:17.573]  That there's geoengineering going on and changing of the climate with the patents added to the jet fuel so even the airline don't even know what's going on in most cases.
[02:54:18.293 --> 02:54:26.379]  They have all these so-called experts all over the news promoting geoengineering and children's textbooks that we've been showing you for a decade under federal curricula.
[02:54:26.399 --> 02:54:33.805]  There's literally scores of them teach, oh we added to jet fuel barium salt aluminum dioxide to put up sunscreen to protect us from global warming.
[02:54:34.385 --> 02:54:35.005]  You can look that up.
[02:54:35.105 --> 02:54:37.007]  Textbooks teach kids about chemtrailing.
[02:54:38.476 --> 02:54:44.181]  So there's a giant, last time I checked, $5 billion a year just Department of Energy with one group.
[02:54:44.862 --> 02:54:50.126]  And then look, Stephen Colbert, Colbert, government likely covering up chemtrail conspiracy.
[02:54:51.007 --> 02:54:56.612]  So they have an expert on their quote saying we need the geoengineer to save the earth because of climate change.
[02:54:58.774 --> 02:55:02.797]  And then Colbert goes, what if the government is already doing this and not telling us about it?
[02:55:03.158 --> 02:55:05.280]  But still, it's all in the context of a joke.
[02:55:06.383 --> 02:55:09.785]  It's like, oh, what if the NSA is really spying on us 15 years ago?
[02:55:09.805 --> 02:55:13.187]  And I'm like, here's the documents, here's the... Oh, shut up, Nutt!
[02:55:15.048 --> 02:55:16.229]  I mean, it's absolute!
[02:55:16.729 --> 02:55:22.093]  But people go, I don't see any documents on chemtrails, because they're not called chemtrails, it's called geoengineering programs.
[02:55:22.573 --> 02:55:25.174]  High-altitude aerosol programs, stuff like that.
[02:55:25.395 --> 02:55:26.815]  You type that in, you'll get it all.
[02:55:27.136 --> 02:55:28.817]  Patents, how they do it, where they're doing it.
[02:55:29.497 --> 02:55:34.308]  And then all these cooks point up at regular condensation trails and go, look, that's it!
[02:55:35.692 --> 02:55:39.540]  So there's also disinfo on the other side, but it's going on, boys and girls.
[02:55:41.184 --> 02:55:43.906]  When I was a kid, condensation trails went away in seconds or minutes.
[02:55:43.926 --> 02:55:46.287]  They didn't stay there for hours and turn the sky gray.
[02:55:46.307 --> 02:55:46.627]  Look at this.
[02:55:46.947 --> 02:55:47.688]  And it goes on.
[02:55:47.708 --> 02:55:49.469]  The video's up on InfoWars.com.
[02:55:49.529 --> 02:55:51.570]  We'll probably cover this on the nightly news tonight.
[02:55:52.110 --> 02:55:53.571]  That's pretty darn important.
[02:55:53.611 --> 02:55:59.474]  That's an InfoWars.com story up there, breaking all of that down.
[02:56:00.054 --> 02:56:05.337]  Some of the other news, Rahm Emanuel to fast 24 hours in support of immigration reform.
[02:56:05.357 --> 02:56:08.479]  They mean totally bringing in unlimited numbers of people to vote
[02:56:09.119 --> 02:56:11.908]  To take all of our money and take all of our guns and enslave us.
[02:56:11.928 --> 02:56:12.870]  That is the public plan.
[02:56:14.054 --> 02:56:14.876]  Rahm Emanuel, who's...
[02:56:16.049 --> 02:56:19.392]  I don't think it's the Israelis, folks, but I mean, he was in the Israeli military.
[02:56:19.712 --> 02:56:22.374]  He is an Israeli firster, just like the new Fed head they want.
[02:56:23.115 --> 02:56:27.499]  And it's like having this French communist as the head economist for Obama.
[02:56:27.539 --> 02:56:34.685]  I mean, our country is just all, half the news anchors are from England, and they're just getting us used to nothing but foreigners running our lives.
[02:56:35.506 --> 02:56:38.428]  And I mean, Rahm Emanuel is a Chicago mob boss pig.
[02:56:39.429 --> 02:56:41.711]  He is a big, disgusting piece of trash.
[02:56:42.312 --> 02:56:43.412]  And I'm so sick of him.
[02:56:43.432 --> 02:56:49.678]  I mean, he's just a miscreant trash bag who wants our guns while he's got bodyguards.
[02:56:49.698 --> 02:56:50.599]  And I'm sick of it.
[02:56:51.239 --> 02:56:52.420]  Jim in Bulgaria.
[02:56:52.460 --> 02:56:53.321]  I didn't see that call.
[02:56:53.341 --> 02:56:53.941]  Thanks for holding.
[02:56:53.981 --> 02:56:54.982]  Sorry, Jim, to make you hold.
[02:56:55.282 --> 02:56:55.643]  Go ahead.
[02:56:55.663 --> 02:56:56.263]  You're on the air.
[02:56:56.283 --> 02:56:58.605]  Hey, Mr. Jones.
[02:56:58.906 --> 02:56:59.546]  Hey, buddy.
[02:56:59.726 --> 02:57:07.393]  I'd like to... I'd like to say... I want you to say hi to your new future InfoWars reporter.
[02:57:08.328 --> 02:57:10.749]  All right, brother, we got about a minute and a half, so thank you.
[02:57:10.809 --> 02:57:11.329]  Yes, tell us.
[02:57:11.509 --> 02:57:12.569]  OK, yeah, I got to be fast.
[02:57:12.650 --> 02:57:32.276]  OK, well, you're an inspiration to me, and I kind of like to make a joke here a little bit and say that you're the reason why I left my friends and family and I moved out of the United States and I came here to Bulgaria to prepare for this worldwide economic collapse and world war.
[02:57:32.636 --> 02:57:37.218]  But of course, it's, you know, it's true.
[02:57:37.717 --> 02:57:41.278]  I mean, you had this other person, Jody's wife.
[02:57:42.339 --> 02:57:45.620]  My wife, she was like a zombie.
[02:57:45.740 --> 02:57:50.362]  I mean, for years and years I used to tell her about this stuff, and she just couldn't get it.
[02:57:50.442 --> 02:57:51.703]  So I had to leave.
[02:57:52.283 --> 02:57:54.284]  I had to leave her, and I had to leave everybody.
[02:57:54.624 --> 02:57:55.364]  And here I am.
[02:57:55.524 --> 02:58:05.508]  I'm in Bulgaria, and I just wanted to say that in the future, when all these Christians, these Christians and Jews that are being killed,
[02:58:06.635 --> 02:58:13.259]  I'm being put here, so I don't want to say where I am, but they can come here and they can be safe.
[02:58:13.319 --> 02:58:22.743]  In Northern Bulgaria, I have this place here that I'm preparing with food, water, I'm... Well, brother, that's exciting, and yeah, upload videos to YouTube from Bulgaria.
[02:58:23.144 --> 02:58:27.546]  Anybody can go out and independently report and say, as an affiliate, I'm reporting
[02:58:28.903 --> 02:58:30.304]  ForInfoWars.com.
[02:58:30.344 --> 02:58:34.087]  For liability, it doesn't mean that people can go set us up, that you actually work for us.
[02:58:34.107 --> 02:58:36.349]  You can just say, I'm here reporting independently.
[02:58:36.409 --> 02:58:37.590]  ForInfoWars.com.
[02:58:37.870 --> 02:58:39.231]  And if it's good, we'll play it right here.
[02:58:39.291 --> 02:58:40.212]  We need your help, folks.
[02:58:40.572 --> 02:58:42.154]  Come back in overdrive, take more calls.

[02:58:51.112 --> 02:58:55.717]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[02:58:55.838 --> 02:58:58.821]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[02:58:58.961 --> 02:59:04.207]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[02:59:04.528 --> 02:59:06.189]  It all comes down to one thing.
[02:59:06.470 --> 02:59:07.771]  We are what we eat.
[02:59:08.112 --> 02:59:10.014]  Our food is devoid of nutrition.
[02:59:10.174 --> 02:59:11.075]  We're good to go.

[02:59:53.764 --> 02:59:55.125]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.826 --> 02:59:59.009]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:05.936 --> 03:00:06.556]  Big Brother.
[03:00:07.237 --> 03:00:08.258]  Mainstream media.
[03:00:08.998 --> 03:00:10.099]  Government cover-ups.
[03:00:10.760 --> 03:00:11.560]  You want answers?
[03:00:12.361 --> 03:00:13.241]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:13.882 --> 03:00:17.525]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:18.085 --> 03:00:22.148]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:32.009 --> 03:00:33.430]  Well, there you see it on screen.
[03:00:33.590 --> 03:00:39.455]  Congressman wants to bring Obama to court for not faithfully executing laws.
[03:00:40.156 --> 03:00:41.917]  And you can see a little doodle I just did there.
[03:00:41.937 --> 03:00:42.958]  A little side issue.
[03:00:43.979 --> 03:00:58.971]  But Congressman Tom Rice of South Carolina Republican is sponsoring a resolution in the House of Representatives that would, if adopted, direct the legislative body to bring a civil action for declaratory or injunctive relief to challenge certain policies and actions taken by the executive branch.
[03:00:59.679 --> 03:01:02.121]  He basically goes on to say that he's acting as a dictator.
[03:01:02.301 --> 03:01:02.622]  This!
[03:01:03.182 --> 03:01:05.424]  I'm really a big fan of Congressman Tom Rice now.
[03:01:05.444 --> 03:01:06.505]  I'll try to get him on, guys.
[03:01:07.586 --> 03:01:10.209]  That is exactly what I expect to start seeing happening.
[03:01:10.509 --> 03:01:14.492]  Here's another one after they put all the chemicals in the food and water to destroy the sperm count.
[03:01:14.512 --> 03:01:19.037]  Scientists create robotic sperm to help with fertilization and drug delivery.
[03:01:19.963 --> 03:01:21.164]  That's out of the London Independent.
[03:01:22.204 --> 03:01:25.045]  Let's go to your calls, as many as I can, I'll just jam them in here.
[03:01:25.766 --> 03:01:28.887]  I'm pretty good about taking calls, I just let folks talk for a long time so we run out of time.
[03:01:29.288 --> 03:01:31.389]  Mike in Denver, go ahead, you're on the air.
[03:01:31.409 --> 03:01:33.310]  Hey Alex, how's it going today, buddy?
[03:01:33.330 --> 03:01:33.910]  Good, brother.
[03:01:34.510 --> 03:01:46.236]  Good, I just wanted to tell you we're having a First Amendment rally for a cake shop owner that was found guilty of discrimination because he wouldn't make a same-sex cake for a gay couple.
[03:01:47.247 --> 03:01:52.009]  Well, those people have a right to not shop there, and I haven't heard about this.
[03:01:52.089 --> 03:01:52.949]  Is this in the news yet?
[03:01:53.549 --> 03:01:54.330]  Yeah, it's in the news.
[03:01:54.410 --> 03:02:06.594]  It happened, he refused them in July, and then they brought a suit against him, and the judge said he couldn't discriminate, but the administrative judge didn't fine him, so now he can't appeal it.
[03:02:07.755 --> 03:02:09.515]  But I mean, again,
[03:02:12.535 --> 03:02:22.621]  I can see the point of saying, you know, why not just make somebody's cake, but next it'll be, you know, I mean, what if he doesn't agree with, say, Catholics or Muslims, doesn't want to make a Muslim cake?
[03:02:23.341 --> 03:02:29.704]  I mean, people could disagree with what he's doing, but they should allow folks, especially if it's not a big chain, to, you know, have their own rights.
[03:02:29.724 --> 03:02:33.366]  I mean, look at how they're trying to make Hobby Lobby, basically,
[03:02:34.841 --> 03:02:39.404]  You know, stay open on Sundays or pay for abortions when they don't want to do that.
[03:02:39.424 --> 03:02:40.465]  And it's owned by a Christian.
[03:02:40.965 --> 03:02:44.027]  So this is really, in the name of liberty, they're creating a tyranny.
[03:02:45.268 --> 03:02:51.051]  If you want to look up Lakewood, Colorado, cake shop, gay problem, they should check it out, but we gotta stop it somewhere.
[03:02:51.712 --> 03:02:54.554]  Well, it says, no right to refuse gay couples wedding cake.
[03:02:55.940 --> 03:02:59.582]  Uh, and it says, uh, let them eat cake, folks out there protesting him.
[03:03:00.062 --> 03:03:05.104]  And it goes on to say, if you're going to sell wedding cakes in Colorado, you have to sell them to everyone who comes into your shop.
[03:03:05.544 --> 03:03:09.926]  You can't pick and choose among customers based upon your belief that some weddings are immoral.
[03:03:09.986 --> 03:03:13.748]  Well, I mean, if you have a religious reason, this is just never going to end.
[03:03:13.768 --> 03:03:18.990]  I mean, and again, folks, why don't these people worry about fluoride in the water that's attacking everybody?
[03:03:19.751 --> 03:03:22.472]  I mean, it's just constantly make people, I mean, I mean,
[03:03:24.056 --> 03:03:24.957]  It's just incredible.
[03:03:24.977 --> 03:03:26.199]  Let's jam in one more caller.
[03:03:26.239 --> 03:03:26.820]  Thanks, Mike.
[03:03:27.040 --> 03:03:28.602]  Let's talk to Richard in Pennsylvania.
[03:03:28.622 --> 03:03:32.347]  But you can't have a nativity scene at the military base, though.
[03:03:32.387 --> 03:03:33.548]  But you can have a gay cake.
[03:03:33.949 --> 03:03:36.072]  See, I mean, it's all selective here.
[03:03:36.352 --> 03:03:37.093]  Go ahead, Richard.
[03:03:37.113 --> 03:03:37.654]  You're on the air.
[03:03:37.674 --> 03:03:40.858]  Yeah, we wouldn't want to be racist or anything like that, you know.
[03:03:41.918 --> 03:03:49.246]  Uh, hey, you know, John Adams said the Constitution was extorted through the grinding necessities of reluctant people, and, uh, you know, he knew what he was talking about.
[03:03:49.266 --> 03:04:01.779]  He lived through it, you know, and, uh, yeah, Alexander Hamilton, uh, threatening the state of New York to separate the city from the state if they didn't go along, and Rhode Island was threatened to be treated as an independent state and taxed out the yin-yang with any business with other states.
[03:04:02.999 --> 03:04:06.021]  And you had the amendments offered up as part of that extortion process.
[03:04:06.521 --> 03:04:12.944]  Oh, just sign here and later on we'll pass these amendments and it'll be a vast sweeping prohibition against government tyranny, you know.
[03:04:13.424 --> 03:04:18.186]  And here we are, you know, with the 60th Amendment, create the IRS which expands government over us, doesn't limit it.
[03:04:19.047 --> 03:04:24.769]  Yeah, well when I say the Constitution, I mean the 1798 type Constitution.
[03:04:24.829 --> 03:04:25.770]  It's not perfect either.
[03:04:26.010 --> 03:04:28.591]  I like the Bill of Rights, which was the answer to the Constitution.
[03:04:29.741 --> 03:04:36.763]  Read the 16th Amendment, and it's in direct contradiction of Article 1, Section 9, that says Congress will not have the power to lay and collect taxes.
[03:04:36.783 --> 03:04:38.744]  I mean, it's just... No, I hear you.
[03:04:38.804 --> 03:04:39.444]  I'm out of time.
[03:04:39.464 --> 03:04:40.204]  Sorry to all the other callers.
[03:04:40.224 --> 03:04:40.745]  Thank you, Richard.
[03:04:41.865 --> 03:04:42.625]  Or, no, Richard's next.
[03:04:42.645 --> 03:04:45.326]  We were just talking to... No, no, we were just talking to Richard.
[03:04:45.606 --> 03:04:47.307]  One time we got to Paul, Danny, and Alex, and others.
[03:04:47.547 --> 03:04:48.387]  Great job to the crew.
[03:04:48.407 --> 03:04:49.987]  Lord willing, I'll be back tomorrow, 11 a.m.
