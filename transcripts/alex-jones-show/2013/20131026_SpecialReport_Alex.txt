[00:00:00.109 --> 00:00:12.320]  Unfortunately, our rights are now being systematically taken away from us.
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.242]  We see this every day.
[00:00:14.262 --> 00:00:20.928]  Whether we go to the DMV, whether we're not allowed to carry our weapons on public property that we own.
[00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:29.775]  You get to eliminate privileges that can be revoked at any time by authorities that feel, I don't like that, I don't care about the law.
[00:00:30.075 --> 00:00:31.756]  I just don't think that's right.
[00:00:32.136 --> 00:00:33.597]  I just agree with the law.
[00:00:34.538 --> 00:00:34.918]  Really?
[00:00:34.938 --> 00:00:37.380]  You can't just make it up as you go along.
[00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.661]  They don't care.
[00:00:38.961 --> 00:00:40.502]  They do whatever they feel they should do.
[00:00:40.542 --> 00:00:43.824]  What kind of world do we live in when police officers refuse to obey the law?
[00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:45.685]  Read the law!
[00:00:46.105 --> 00:00:47.226]  Read the law!
[00:00:47.646 --> 00:00:48.827]  Read the law!
[00:00:49.147 --> 00:00:50.108]  Obey your own

[00:00:57.836 --> 00:00:58.256]  Obey your oath!
[00:00:58.276 --> 00:00:58.917]  Obey your oath!
[00:00:58.957 --> 00:00:59.877]  Obey your oath!
[00:00:59.937 --> 00:01:00.618]  Obey your oath!
[00:01:00.678 --> 00:01:01.058]  Obey your oath!
[00:01:01.078 --> 00:01:01.498]  Obey your oath!
[00:01:01.518 --> 00:01:01.899]  Obey your oath!

[00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:03.320]  Obey your oath!
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.820]  Obey your oath!
[00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:04.480]  Obey your oath!

[00:01:05.141 --> 00:01:05.521]  Obey your oath!
[00:01:05.541 --> 00:01:06.142]  Obey your oath!
[00:01:06.162 --> 00:01:06.642]  Obey your oath!
[00:01:06.662 --> 00:01:07.302]  Obey your oath!
[00:01:07.362 --> 00:01:08.163]  Obey your oath!
[00:01:08.183 --> 00:01:08.863]  Obey your oath!
[00:01:08.883 --> 00:01:09.504]  Obey your oath!
[00:01:09.524 --> 00:01:10.204]  Obey your oath!
[00:01:10.224 --> 00:01:10.785]  Obey your oath!
[00:01:10.805 --> 00:01:11.145]  Obey your oath!
[00:01:11.165 --> 00:01:11.685]  Obey your oath!
[00:01:11.725 --> 00:01:12.346]  Obey your oath!
[00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:13.046]  Obey your oath!
[00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:14.027]  Obey your oath!
[00:01:14.047 --> 00:01:14.807]  Obey your oath!
[00:01:14.827 --> 00:01:15.468]  Obey your oath!

[00:01:17.589 --> 00:01:18.310]  Obey your oath!
[00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.650]  Obey your oath!
[00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:19.070]  Obey your oath!
[00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.591]  Obey your oath
[00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.664]  He did not break a wall!
[00:01:25.578 --> 00:01:32.082]  In order for it to be a handgun, it's got to meet the requirements of Chapter 46.
[00:01:32.242 --> 00:01:33.362]  It doesn't.
[00:01:33.382 --> 00:01:35.844]  Do you cite the law under which you're arresting him?
[00:01:35.884 --> 00:01:39.105]  Hey, what are you charging him with?
[00:01:39.125 --> 00:01:40.326]  Tell me what you're charged with.
[00:01:40.346 --> 00:01:41.827]  You haven't identified yourself to me, sir.
[00:01:41.847 --> 00:01:42.987]  You haven't identified yourself.
[00:01:43.007 --> 00:01:44.728]  Three forms of identification, sir.
[00:01:44.828 --> 00:01:45.949]  Identify what he's done.
[00:01:45.989 --> 00:01:47.690]  Hey, why are you guys harassing me?
[00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.091]  You get back.
[00:01:49.111 --> 00:01:51.532]  You're a stalking assistant!
[00:01:51.992 --> 00:01:53.033]  Read the law!
[00:01:53.513 --> 00:01:54.654]  Read the law!
[00:01:55.034 --> 00:01:56.234]  Read the law!
[00:01:56.574 --> 00:01:57.775]  Obey your oath!
[00:01:57.975 --> 00:01:59.395]  Obey your oath!
[00:01:59.736 --> 00:02:01.036]  Obey your oath!
[00:02:01.056 --> 00:02:01.816]  Obey your oath!
[00:02:18.343 --> 00:02:21.165]  Sir, you're interfering with arrest.
[00:02:21.185 --> 00:02:21.386]  How?
[00:02:21.486 --> 00:02:23.067]  Are you trying to arrest me?
[00:02:23.107 --> 00:02:25.910]  You're interfering with a transport, so you need to move out of the way.
[00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:26.851]  He has plenty of room!
[00:02:26.871 --> 00:02:27.772]  He has plenty of room right here!
[00:02:33.638 --> 00:02:36.020]  Sir, you may be subject to arrest.
[00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:37.000]  For what?
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.961]  Under what violation?
[00:02:38.221 --> 00:02:39.983]  Sir, you stand in front of vehicles.
[00:02:40.103 --> 00:02:41.584]  I'm not standing anywhere, sir.
[00:02:41.644 --> 00:02:43.785]  I have a freaking bad ankle.
[00:02:44.125 --> 00:02:46.727]  Do you need EMS?
[00:02:47.368 --> 00:02:47.968]  Do I need EMS?
[00:02:48.028 --> 00:02:51.631]  Probably, but I might charge you guys for freaking assault.
[00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:52.972]  Your guy in the blue shirt.
[00:02:53.052 --> 00:02:54.093]  They're about to arrest you.
[00:02:54.973 --> 00:02:56.396]  You're stepping on me, sir.
[00:02:56.416 --> 00:02:57.257]  You're pushing me back.
[00:02:57.317 --> 00:02:58.539]  What's your name, sir?
[00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:59.961]  He's a replica pistol.
[00:03:00.101 --> 00:03:01.263]  This guy just assaulted me.
[00:03:01.323 --> 00:03:01.984]  He pushed me back.
[00:03:02.004 --> 00:03:02.926]  He's pushing the press.
[00:03:02.966 --> 00:03:03.627]  What's his name?
[00:03:03.647 --> 00:03:04.689]  He's pushing the press.
[00:03:04.929 --> 00:03:05.570]  What's your name, sir?
[00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:06.211]  I think I got this.
[00:03:06.271 --> 00:03:07.012]  Okay, tough guy.
[00:03:10.615 --> 00:03:11.255]  I was too!
[00:03:11.295 --> 00:03:13.438]  The guy stepped on my foot!
[00:03:13.578 --> 00:03:15.019]  Answer the question!
[00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:17.882]  Curios and antiques are not firearms!
[00:03:17.922 --> 00:03:19.404]  They are not handguns!
[00:03:19.444 --> 00:03:20.926]  Who assaulted you?
[00:03:21.887 --> 00:03:23.929]  Uh, Deputy Cruz assaulted me!
[00:03:24.029 --> 00:03:26.892]  He was throwing somebody around and threw somebody in my jaw!
[00:03:30.255 --> 00:03:34.657]  Ladies and gentlemen, what you just witnessed is the police state.
[00:03:35.278 --> 00:03:43.521]  Two citizens were lawfully carrying pre-1899 revolvers under Texas Penal Code 46.01.
[00:03:44.042 --> 00:03:52.826]  Any pre-1899 pistol or replica is not considered a firearm.
[00:03:53.286 --> 00:03:55.427]  Not considered a firearm.
[00:03:56.505 --> 00:04:02.050]  Texas DPS just arrested two people for not carrying a firearm.
[00:04:02.511 --> 00:04:04.813]  For lawfully carrying a firearm.
[00:04:05.374 --> 00:04:10.358]  So when they say they're not coming for your guns, you just saw it first hand.
