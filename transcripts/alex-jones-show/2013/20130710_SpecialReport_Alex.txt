[00:00:09.462 --> 00:00:09.923]  The U.S.
[00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:16.321]  government has been busy denying their big brother behavior in our daily lives, but they can't deny their involvement in eugenics.
[00:00:16.823 --> 00:00:17.585]  Here's the latest.
[00:00:18.422 --> 00:00:29.668]  A new and investigative report shows that nearly 150 females were sterilized between 2006 and 2010 by doctors under contract with the California Department of Corrections.
[00:00:30.168 --> 00:00:36.272]  One prisoner who worked in the infirmary overheard medical staff encouraging multiple offenders to be sterilized.
[00:00:36.532 --> 00:00:42.515]  Although federal and state laws ban prisoner sterilizations with federal monies, California used state funds.
[00:00:43.015 --> 00:00:51.085]  The San Francisco Gate shows a map of California's role similar to the Nazis' goal of purification and the state's contribution to eugenics.
[00:00:51.605 --> 00:00:59.535]  California was the second state to pass eugenics laws in 1909, two years after Indiana made it legal to sterilize the feeble-minded.
[00:01:00.035 --> 00:01:14.105]  According to the University of Virginia bioethicist Paul Lombardo, Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger opened the first birth control clinic in 1916, and in 1934 she was quoted saying, America needs a code for babies.
[00:01:14.645 --> 00:01:22.291]  The purpose of the American Baby Code should be to provide for a better distribution of babies, to assist couples who wish to prevent overproduction of offspring,
[00:01:22.991 --> 00:01:31.515]  And thus, to reduce the burden of charity and taxation for the public relief, and to protect society against the propagation and increase of the unfit.
[00:01:31.875 --> 00:01:33.236]  More quotes from Margaret Sanger.
[00:01:33.256 --> 00:01:34.937]  Here's another one from Margaret Sanger.
[00:01:43.721 --> 00:01:53.085]  Moving forward, presidential frontrunner for 2016 Hillary Clinton was awarded the Margaret Sanger Award in March of 2009 and claimed to be in awe of her.
[00:01:53.105 --> 00:01:57.908]  I admire Margaret Sanger enormously.
[00:01:58.748 --> 00:02:02.370]  Her courage, her tenacity, her vision.
[00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.551]  I am really in awe of her.
[00:02:05.535 --> 00:02:09.039]  All this is just more evidence that our government likes to play God.
[00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:13.243]  Not only are they sterilizing human beings, but now they've moved on to our pets.
[00:02:13.964 --> 00:02:14.424]  The U.S.
[00:02:14.484 --> 00:02:18.428]  government is scheduled to start testing a new vaccine to sterilize dogs.
[00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:25.235]  The government vaccine, GonaCon, is scheduled to be tested in September on two Indian reservations.
[00:02:26.036 --> 00:02:35.078]  In the GONA CON tests, dogs will be caught, microchipped, tattooed, collared, injected, and released, says spay and neuter expert Ruth Steinberger.
[00:02:35.738 --> 00:02:38.238]  Their idea is to control the dog population.
[00:02:39.198 --> 00:02:40.299]  Population control?
[00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:42.839]  What happened to our government just governing?
