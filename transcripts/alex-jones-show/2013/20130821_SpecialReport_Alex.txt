[00:00:11.431 --> 00:00:15.436]  This morning NPR carried a gung-ho report on gun confiscation in California.
[00:00:15.857 --> 00:00:21.123]  They accompanied a gang of government employees as they went about confiscating guns, as they put it, one by one.
[00:00:21.892 --> 00:00:27.496]  We're riding in a caravan of four unmarked trucks through the bedroom communities of the San Francisco East Bay.
[00:00:27.876 --> 00:00:34.160]  The trucks carry nine state agents wearing bulletproof vests and armed with .40 caliber Glock pistols and tasers.
[00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.102]  They'll spend the next six hours looking for illegal guns.
[00:00:38.343 --> 00:00:39.864]  Well, isn't that exciting and fun?
[00:00:40.364 --> 00:00:44.927]  But one thing that was missing from the NPR report was the constitutional perspective.
[00:00:45.407 --> 00:00:48.848]  Also missing was what it feels like to be on the receiving end of that.
[00:00:49.128 --> 00:00:57.310]  We have someone, Joe Mendez, who had this happen to him in California, and he gives a perspective of what it feels like to have your constitutional rights violated.
[00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:05.312]  Immediately, I got two M16 machine gun rifles within five inches from my face on both sides.
[00:01:06.452 --> 00:01:14.274]  One cop came up with his gun in my face, and the other one proceeded to put my hands behind my back, conducted a raid.
[00:01:15.285 --> 00:01:15.966]  I don't think so.
[00:01:33.291 --> 00:01:35.253]  And they lured me out of my house.
[00:01:35.534 --> 00:01:39.898]  They concocted a story and they told my wife in the morning when she woke up.
[00:01:40.098 --> 00:01:46.786]  A phony CHP car shows up and tells my wife, Hey, your car was involved in a hit and run last night.
[00:01:47.446 --> 00:01:48.608]  We're taking a report.
[00:01:49.068 --> 00:01:52.549]  And who are these people that NPR is so excited about having their guns confiscated?
[00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:53.930]  Armed and prohibited persons.
[00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.710]  Armed and prohibited persons.
[00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.870]  APPs.
[00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:56.211]  They've even got an acronym for it.
[00:01:56.231 --> 00:02:00.052]  These assault rifles were purchased in the 1980s and they are fabricated from 1984
[00:02:20.522 --> 00:02:25.766]  These are people who purchased firearms legally, but now California has decided that they've lost a right to own a gun.
[00:02:26.267 --> 00:02:28.288]  What does it take to lose your right in California?
[00:02:28.308 --> 00:02:29.870]  A felony conviction.
[00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.711]  Well, there's a lot of felonies on the books.
[00:02:32.212 --> 00:02:34.894]  Even things like releasing balloons on a beach can be a felony.
[00:02:35.464 --> 00:02:39.606]  You could have a complaint, a domestic dispute, or even a minor misdemeanor conviction.
[00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:47.991]  Well, to paraphrase Pastor Martin Niemoller, first they came for the people with non-violent felony convictions, then they came for the people with misdemeanor convictions.
[00:02:48.371 --> 00:02:55.475]  NPR is proud of the fact that California is cross-checking what they call, quote, an extensive, constantly updated database.
[00:02:55.655 --> 00:02:59.097]  The NRA initially supported this law, but now even they are opposing it.
[00:02:59.517 --> 00:03:03.059]  For instance, if you are in a fight and you admit to being in the fight,
[00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:08.561]  You can lose your right to own guns and find yourself being SWAT teamed to confiscate your guns.
[00:03:08.921 --> 00:03:11.222]  And what does this tell us about the government's priorities?
[00:03:11.462 --> 00:03:16.904]  A couple of months before there was a guy who was renting here who we couldn't get rid of.
[00:03:16.924 --> 00:03:18.865]  He was cooking meth.
[00:03:19.685 --> 00:03:22.046]  Governor Jerry Brown is expanding this program.
[00:03:42.594 --> 00:03:47.776]  Hiring 36 agents at a cost of $24 million, that's about $670,000 per agent.
[00:03:48.196 --> 00:03:51.137]  Why does the government ignore crime and attack peaceful gun owners?
[00:03:51.517 --> 00:03:54.178]  Could that money be better spent on stopping violent crime?
[00:03:54.838 --> 00:04:03.121]  But NPR tells us it's tedious, expensive, and time-consuming work for dozens of armed agents to ambush gun owners one by one.
[00:04:03.301 --> 00:04:06.262]  This is where gun registration leads to gun confiscation.
[00:04:06.602 --> 00:04:09.723]  The point of gun registration is gun confiscation.
[00:04:10.123 --> 00:04:15.268]  They believe that they are the only ones that should possess firearms.
[00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:17.030]  Owning a gun is not a crime.
[00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:23.156]  The criminals are those who violate the Constitution and their oath of office to confiscate the guns of peaceful gun owners.
[00:04:23.556 --> 00:04:28.181]  You too must abide by the law and you haven't been abiding by the law in a long time.
