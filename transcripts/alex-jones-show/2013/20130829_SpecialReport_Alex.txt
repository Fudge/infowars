[00:00:11.206 --> 00:00:17.569]  What brings me out here is, well, really long-standing support in my own denomination for workers and for workers' rights.
[00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.593]  Today we're out here to fight for workers' rights, particularly in the restaurant industry, to have a livable wage.
[00:00:24.513 --> 00:00:30.056]  My name is Sophia Portier and I'm out here with United Students Against Sweat Shops and we're supporting Fight for $15.
[00:00:30.516 --> 00:00:39.581]  Fight for $15 is a campaign that fast food workers are running across the country trying to attain $15 an hour for the work that they do.
[00:00:40.097 --> 00:00:46.203]  This is an extension of Dr. King's work, 50 years ago, that was a march on Washington for freedom and for jobs.
[00:00:46.383 --> 00:00:52.049]  I've been a fast food worker myself, and so there's no reason why people who do those types of jobs can't get a living wage.
[00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:57.735]  They deserve to be paid the wage that their work is worth, and their work is worth a lot more than they're being paid now.
[00:00:57.755 --> 00:01:00.017]  $15 an hour to work at fast food, that's a little high.
[00:01:00.037 --> 00:01:01.578]  What would you say to those people?
[00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.514]  I would say that they should work as a fast food worker for a little while and see what it's like to do that type of job.
[00:01:07.614 --> 00:01:16.800]  You know, the way the rhetoric always runs on these things is if we're going to give them a pay raise, $15 an hour, then we're going to have to cut back on the number of workers we have.
[00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.802]  Nobody talks about cutting the profit margin.
[00:01:19.862 --> 00:01:25.526]  That $15, when it goes into the pockets of the normal people, is going to go back into the market economy.
[00:01:25.986 --> 00:01:30.729]  So it actually does better for the economy than not paying them.
[00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:31.710]  When you don't pay them,
[00:01:33.471 --> 00:01:35.714]  They have a much harder time living.
[00:01:35.894 --> 00:01:38.998]  They have to then rely on all of the public programs that we have.
[00:01:49.298 --> 00:01:57.460]  Does it concern you at all with the current healthcare system, the Obamacare, where employers are actually cutting their workers hours so the workers can't qualify for healthcare?
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.160]  Does that concern you?
[00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.421]  Right, that's another big problem.
[00:02:00.481 --> 00:02:03.721]  Not everyone has access to medical care, to healthcare.
[00:02:03.782 --> 00:02:13.664]  The kinds of actions that you're talking about where people are cutting hours so that someone falls just underneath the healthcare threshold, that's the action of corporate autocracy.
[00:02:14.064 --> 00:02:18.165]  That's the action of a corporate system that really does not care for the people that it
[00:02:18.666 --> 00:02:22.413]  That it employs, really does not care for anything other than their own bottom line.
[00:02:22.774 --> 00:02:27.884]  And if that means they have to subject people to inhumane treatment in order to get that bottom line, that's what they'll do.
[00:02:38.266 --> 00:02:42.448]  InfoWars.com is proud to introduce the new InfoWars skateboards by Alien Workshop.
[00:02:42.968 --> 00:02:44.969]  Skaters have always been against the grain socially.
[00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:46.629]  Now wake up your friends politically.
[00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:48.550]  Just go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.571]  We have Divide and Conquer or Brainwashing.
[00:02:51.051 --> 00:02:56.513]  Then take your deck to your local skate shop, pick out your own trucks, your own wheels, and then hit the streets and wake some people up.
[00:02:56.853 --> 00:02:58.674]  Here is legendary skateboarder Jake Nunn.
[00:02:59.074 --> 00:03:01.375]  This one has a lot more concave than I have on my board.
[00:03:01.615 --> 00:03:02.455]  And I like concave.
[00:03:02.815 --> 00:03:04.656]  It makes it easier to turn and feel the board.
[00:03:05.436 --> 00:03:05.916]  It's pretty cool.
[00:03:05.956 --> 00:03:07.357]  I mean, it's almost the same shape as mine.
[00:03:08.288 --> 00:03:09.988]  It's not really a sport, and it's not really art.
[00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:12.329]  It's just kind of freedom, you know?
[00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:15.810]  I've listened to Alex Jones for a long time, and I love what InfoWars does.
[00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.570]  I've always loved Alien Workshop, too.
[00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.271]  I think it's kind of cool you guys got together.
[00:03:20.271 --> 00:03:21.051]  This one's pretty nice.
[00:03:22.511 --> 00:03:24.352]  Definitely one for the wall, one for the collection.
[00:03:25.152 --> 00:03:25.872]  Also good to skate.
[00:03:26.592 --> 00:03:30.313]  Get these limited edition decks at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:03:31.013 --> 00:03:31.613]  This is Jake Nunn.

[00:03:35.514 --> 00:03:36.815]  Alien Workshop collaboration.
