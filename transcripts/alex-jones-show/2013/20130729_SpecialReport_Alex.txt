[00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:13.366]  Mice go where they've never been before.
[00:00:14.147 --> 00:00:14.587]  Literally.
[00:00:15.248 --> 00:00:18.010]  False memories have been implanted into mice, scientists say.
[00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:19.852]  Implants.
[00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:22.214]  Those aren't your memories.
[00:00:22.234 --> 00:00:23.215]  They're somebody else's.
[00:00:24.597 --> 00:00:31.141]  A team was able to make the mice wrongly associate a benign environment with a previous unpleasant experience from different surroundings.
[00:00:31.862 --> 00:00:36.405]  One day, they hope to remove fear associated with the conditions of post-traumatic stress disorder.
[00:00:37.346 --> 00:00:54.337]  At the University of Southern California, Theodore Berger, a biomedical engineer, says he and his partners have not tested human and neuroprothesis, but their experiments show how a silicone chip externally connected to rat and monkey brains by electrodes can process information just like actual neurons.
[00:00:55.378 --> 00:00:57.940]  Ultimately, humans have highly unreliable memories.
[00:00:58.561 --> 00:00:59.422]  So step aside.
[00:00:59.862 --> 00:01:00.663]  Let them help you.
[00:01:01.624 --> 00:01:07.870]  InfoWars reported about the RFID chip implants being used for VIP members of a nightclub, the Baja Beach Club.
[00:01:08.491 --> 00:01:12.055]  VIP club goers willfully implanted microchips back in 2005.
[00:01:13.156 --> 00:01:15.278]  And recently, we covered microchipping our pets.
[00:01:15.898 --> 00:01:16.999]  But what about smart dust?
[00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.032]  Much like an RFID transmitter is read.
[00:01:20.452 --> 00:01:24.596]  A team at the University of California Berkeley say the brain can interface with a computer.
[00:01:25.156 --> 00:01:28.539]  Engineers explain how smart dust could spy on your brain.
[00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:36.246]  It's best explained that the neural dust is interrogated by another component placed beneath the scale but powered from outside the body.
[00:01:36.786 --> 00:01:42.131]  This generates the ultrasound that powers the neural dust and sensors that listen out for their response.
[00:01:42.791 --> 00:01:43.992]  Rather like an RFID.
[00:01:44.412 --> 00:01:45.233]  More spying?
[00:01:45.553 --> 00:01:47.414]  As if the NSA doesn't do it enough.
[00:01:48.054 --> 00:01:54.218]  Get your copy of the new DVD, State of Mind, and see how it exposes the technology behind mass mind control.
