[00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.680]  Sir, what brings you out here today?
[00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:22.542]  Oh, the Veterans Day Memorial Ceremony.
[00:00:23.082 --> 00:00:23.562]  And you serve?
[00:00:24.023 --> 00:00:24.483]  Yes, I do.
[00:00:24.543 --> 00:00:25.563]  I still currently serve.
[00:00:25.964 --> 00:00:27.344]  Okay, you serve in the?
[00:00:27.664 --> 00:00:30.086]  Texas Army National Guard, part of the Texas Military Forces.
[00:00:30.486 --> 00:00:37.649]  Well, I'm a veteran and I'm participating in the parade and I'm going to present the wreath to the unknown veterans.
[00:00:37.669 --> 00:00:40.151]  Do you have any firearms with you today, sir?
[00:00:40.811 --> 00:00:42.752]  Oh, no, I don't have any with me today.
[00:00:43.252 --> 00:00:43.432]  Okay.
[00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:46.050]  Yeah, you didn't need them today.
[00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.931]  All right, what do you think about all the recent gun legislation?
[00:00:48.951 --> 00:00:53.153]  You know, we've had the attacks at the schools and the malls, and a lot of people are trying to take the guns away.
[00:00:53.173 --> 00:00:54.954]  Do you think that's a good thing to take the guns away?
[00:00:55.855 --> 00:00:56.955]  Uh, no, I sure don't.
[00:00:57.055 --> 00:00:59.236]  I fully believe in the Second Amendment.
[00:00:59.737 --> 00:01:05.580]  Now, there's been a lot of talk in the news about firearms and why we need, uh, essentially assault weapons.
[00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.521]  Do you agree that we should ban assault weapons?
[00:01:08.581 --> 00:01:12.003]  I agree that every person should be entitled to carry whatever weapon he wants.
[00:01:12.591 --> 00:01:15.972]  This is a law, it's basically a disposable bazooka.
[00:01:16.432 --> 00:01:17.772]  Disposable bazooka?
[00:01:17.812 --> 00:01:24.414]  Yeah, when they phased out the 3-5 rocket, which was the bazooka that carried NAM, we actually started using these.
[00:01:24.434 --> 00:01:29.996]  I've seen reports about people in the military not being able to observe their faith, their faith rights being suppressed.
[00:01:30.056 --> 00:01:31.296]  I don't think it's okay.
[00:01:31.516 --> 00:01:41.899]  I think people should be given the opportunity to practice their religion, as long as it doesn't offend other people or other religions.
[00:01:42.722 --> 00:01:43.724]  Oh yeah, they should.
[00:01:44.245 --> 00:01:47.492]  They should be able to observe their own faith no matter what religion it is.
[00:01:47.512 --> 00:01:49.496]  Because this is a free country.
[00:01:59.104 --> 00:02:00.004]  We're on the march.
[00:02:00.464 --> 00:02:02.105]  The empire's on the run.
