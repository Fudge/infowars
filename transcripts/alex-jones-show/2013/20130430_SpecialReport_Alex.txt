[00:00:07.546 --> 00:00:11.067]  Here at InfoWars, our motto is, there's a war on for your mind.
[00:00:11.467 --> 00:00:17.228]  Well, that statement becomes more literal by the day, as the human brain becomes the battleground of the future.
[00:00:17.828 --> 00:00:23.690]  The New York Times recently ran a story about brain-computer interfaces inching closer to the mainstream.
[00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.531]  With a simple wink of an eye, you can take a picture using your Google Glass.
[00:00:28.231 --> 00:00:32.396]  A mere thought about a human emotion allows you to sift through Flickr photo albums.
[00:00:32.897 --> 00:00:38.124]  You can chase zombies or play Tetris on your iPhone, all by using your mind as the joystick.
[00:00:38.604 --> 00:00:43.350]  And for now, attaching some sort of cybernetic device to your head to scan your brainwaves.
[00:00:43.951 --> 00:00:50.974]  In the right hands, BIC technology could greatly enhance the quality of life for those who've lost limbs or suffer from paralysis.
[00:00:51.374 --> 00:00:58.116]  Brain-related diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's could become obsolete with breakthroughs in brain-computer interface technology.
[00:00:58.656 --> 00:01:08.080]  But the altruistic potentiality of BICs is overshadowed by DARPA's involvement with the Mind Mapping Project, hinting at the brain's place in the future of warfare.
[00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:15.365]  TechCrunch reported last year that scientists were able to extract personal secrets using brainwave reading devices.
[00:01:16.065 --> 00:01:19.547]  Will DARPA figure out how to hack the brain on a larger scale?
[00:01:19.988 --> 00:01:25.271]  How easy would it be to take down Assad or other dictators if we could just install some malware?
[00:01:26.152 --> 00:01:35.095]  Thanks to the cultural permanence of iPhones, computers, and now Google Glass, it'll be easier than ever to penetrate the human mind, which has no firewall.
[00:01:35.635 --> 00:01:41.197]  The youngest generation and their perpetual connectedness are the most susceptible to the shadow government.
[00:01:41.857 --> 00:01:48.379]  Visit the InfoWars store and pick up a copy of Cats in Black for a fun way to teach your kids about surveillance.
[00:01:48.919 --> 00:01:52.100]  I'm Leanne McAdoo and this has been an InfoWars News Bulletin.
