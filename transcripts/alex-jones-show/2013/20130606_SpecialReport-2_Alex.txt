[00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:17.524]  Speed cameras and red light cameras are just another way for counties and cities to steal millions from citizens while denying due process of law.
[00:00:18.225 --> 00:00:29.651]  Case in point, Judge Ruhlman of Hamilton, Ohio, said that the Elmwood Place cameras that were there, the automated speed enforcement program, were just a case of three-card Monty or a sham.
[00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:39.473]  The speeding ticket generated by opto-traffic from an uncalibrated machine and no possibility for a trial stacked impossible odds against the citizens.
[00:00:39.974 --> 00:00:45.923]  In Baltimore, one of these dependable speed cameras gave a speeding ticket to a motionless car.
[00:00:46.283 --> 00:00:49.204]  Makes you wonder how many tickets are given without just cause.
[00:00:49.804 --> 00:00:50.785]  You can fight back.
[00:00:51.265 --> 00:00:55.826]  Arizona was the only state to implement photo enforcement on major highways.
[00:00:56.407 --> 00:01:08.571]  And in 2010, Infowars.com reported about Arizonians who stood up and fought back by covering cameras with wrapping paper, boxes, and even the Easter Bunny got involved.
[00:01:09.111 --> 00:01:16.413]  As a result of citizen revolt in July of 2010, Arizona pulled the plug on this program of abuse.
[00:01:16.793 --> 00:01:18.333]  Arm yourself with the truth.
