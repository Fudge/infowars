[00:00:04.431 --> 00:00:09.252]  Well, over the last few days, three 20-year-olds built a website much like healthcare.gov.
[00:00:09.612 --> 00:00:13.534]  You can actually log on to it and find out how much health insurance will cost you.
[00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:17.815]  On the website, you'll see that the insurance purchaser can decide if they want to buy.
[00:00:17.835 --> 00:00:19.616]  And if they do, the information on how
[00:00:19.916 --> 00:00:26.599]  Don't worry, if Obamacare collapses, guess who pays for it?
[00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:34.802]  Last week on the Incidental Economist blog, Adriana McIntyre explained a provision buried in the health care law called the Risk Corridor.
[00:00:35.042 --> 00:00:41.184]  It's one of Obamacare's three R's, along with Reinsurance and Risk Adjustment, that are intended to protect insurers.
[00:00:41.664 --> 00:00:43.686]  Especially in Obamacare's first three years.
[00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:49.751]  Risk adjustment and reinsurance both require profitable health plans to share risk with unprofitable ones.
[00:00:50.211 --> 00:00:56.496]  In the event of a widespread failure, taxpayers potentially face a multi-billion dollar bailout of health insurers.
[00:00:56.676 --> 00:00:59.217]  And Kathleen Sebelius is in the hot seat again.
[00:00:59.677 --> 00:01:05.478]  On Wednesday, they start the hearings, in which she's going to continue testifying, and two scandals may actually come up.
[00:01:05.919 --> 00:01:08.279]  The first one is Enroll America.
[00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:09.239]  You may have heard of it.
[00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:16.521]  First, federal law prohibits governmental regulators, such as HHS, from soliciting funds from entities that they regulate.
[00:01:16.902 --> 00:01:25.604]  Sebelius claims she did not solicit from these HHS-regulated groups, but admits to contacting them and talking to them about Enroll America.
[00:01:26.144 --> 00:01:29.308]  And for scandal number two, you may have heard the name Anthony Welters.
[00:01:29.588 --> 00:01:32.812]  He's a huge Obama donor and a regular at the White House.
[00:01:33.452 --> 00:01:37.497]  He's also the executive vice president of a company named UnitedHealth Group.
[00:01:38.097 --> 00:01:46.086]  He's already made millions from Obamacare because UnitedHealth Group owns QSSI, a software company responsible for a large portion of Healthcare.gov.
[00:01:46.767 --> 00:01:52.711]  There's also something called an anti-kickback law, which Sebelius seems to think that Welters is immune to.
