[00:00:12.034 --> 00:00:22.883]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial commons.
[00:00:22.943 --> 00:00:28.287]  In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown Dallas.
[00:00:28.387 --> 00:00:34.532]  The first reports say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by the shooting.
[00:00:34.732 --> 00:00:36.153]  It is a big idea.
[00:00:36.213 --> 00:00:37.854]  A new world order.
[00:00:42.191 --> 00:00:44.272]  It was almost as if there were plans in motion.
[00:00:44.292 --> 00:00:45.193]  It's just pancakes.
[00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:52.837]  Either you were with us, or you were with the terrorists.
[00:01:06.323 --> 00:01:11.417]  I believe that a lot of guys would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[00:01:16.292 --> 00:01:18.293]  No one will be able to beat all of us.
[00:01:18.673 --> 00:01:19.793]  We're going to take all of you.
[00:01:19.813 --> 00:01:24.675]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city.
[00:01:24.695 --> 00:01:26.096]  Global governance at last.
[00:01:26.196 --> 00:01:28.557]  Is it one world the central bank is in charge?
[00:01:28.577 --> 00:01:31.918]  Aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[00:01:32.058 --> 00:01:36.720]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms.
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.041]  Do you understand?
[00:01:38.761 --> 00:01:43.483]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:48.055 --> 00:01:52.136]  Welcome to InfoWars Nightly News on this Friday, March 1st, 2013.
[00:01:53.077 --> 00:01:56.758]  Mike Adams, the health ranger, filling in for the regular crew here tonight.
[00:01:57.058 --> 00:01:59.239]  Here's what's coming up on tonight's broadcast.
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:08.562]  Tonight, as resistance to food tyranny rises, Iowa is on the verge of legalizing raw milk.
[00:02:08.942 --> 00:02:15.124]  But the Supreme Court blocks the attempt of citizens to get the court to even look at the surveillance state.
[00:02:16.297 --> 00:02:22.767]  An Obama supporter drinks the Kool-Aid and would rather be murdered than use a gun in self-defense.
[00:02:23.408 --> 00:02:27.374]  All that and more coming up on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:02:31.169 --> 00:02:35.752]  First story for tonight, Iowa is on the verge of legalizing raw milk.
[00:02:37.053 --> 00:02:39.294]  Yeah, it sounds crazy that it would even be illegal.
[00:02:39.874 --> 00:02:44.457]  It's not illegal in other countries like China, Cuba, North Korea.
[00:02:44.837 --> 00:02:54.183]  It's only illegal in many places in the United States, but Iowa is trying to now fight against that and have some food freedom or at least some consumer choice in that state.
[00:02:54.563 --> 00:02:56.945]  It would join other states where legislation is on the table.
[00:02:57.185 --> 00:02:57.565]  We're good to go.
[00:03:12.532 --> 00:03:22.360]  Member of Congress, Representative Jason Schultz, says the reason this bill is important is we have a growing constituency in Iowa who wants access to this product.
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:28.645]  He goes on to ask, well, if consumers can buy raw meat and raw eggs, there's no reason
[00:03:28.965 --> 00:03:31.487]  Why they shouldn't be able to buy raw milk.
[00:03:31.967 --> 00:03:39.793]  But of course, that involves logic and the entire attack on raw milk has nothing to do with logic.
[00:03:40.273 --> 00:03:50.661]  Everything to do with monopolistic market practices to protect the conventional, pasteurized, homogenized dairy industry by eliminating the competition.
[00:03:51.081 --> 00:04:03.109]  We see the same thing in medicine, where the American Medical Association has a very long history of trying to suppress chiropractic medicine, alternative medicine, holistic medicine, medicinal herbs, and even nutrition.
[00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:08.633]  We see the same thing with Big Pharma, trying to suppress all kinds of alternative medicine and nutritional supplements.
[00:04:08.973 --> 00:04:20.401]  So it's nothing new, business as usual, but thank goodness, Iowa is now trying to take a stand against monopolistic market practices by giving consumers a choice of raw milk in their state.
[00:04:21.561 --> 00:04:23.242]  All right, next story here.
[00:04:23.302 --> 00:04:27.523]  We have BPA is deadly to the development of brains.
[00:04:27.583 --> 00:04:41.526]  It turns out that if you expose developing babies to bisphenol A, the hormone mimicking chemical that's found in plastics, and even you can get it off of cash register receipts because those are coated with BPA,
[00:04:42.106 --> 00:04:56.218]  Well, if you expose these babies to that chemical, then they have limited neurological development, which some people believe may be related to the development of autism and may help explain the rise in autism rates across America.
[00:04:56.638 --> 00:04:59.040]  So this study was out of Duke University.
[00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:06.887]  Scientists there in North Carolina were able to identify that this exposure has potentially toxic neurological
[00:05:08.027 --> 00:05:16.311]  And remember, BPA is just one of many chemicals that pregnant women are now exposed to, including vaccine adjuvants.
[00:05:16.791 --> 00:05:17.571]  What are adjuvants?
[00:05:17.992 --> 00:05:31.457]  Those are the chemicals that are intentionally added to vaccines in an attempt to make them more effective at causing an inflammatory response in the body, which the CDC says is immunity, but they're wrong.
[00:05:31.657 --> 00:05:32.818]  It's just inflammation.
[00:05:33.338 --> 00:05:39.662]  And that's this is why, by the way, flu shots cause a massive increase in spontaneous abortions.
[00:05:40.183 --> 00:05:44.666]  So if your baby is aborted from a flu shot, there you go.
[00:05:44.726 --> 00:05:47.408]  The government has achieved its population control agenda.
[00:05:47.808 --> 00:05:54.592]  If your baby isn't aborted and you take a flu shot, it might be born with autism or other neurological disorders.
[00:05:54.612 --> 00:06:02.718]  And that also achieves the government's aim of keeping all the American people suppressed and disease dumbed down and enslaved for life.
[00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:17.429]  All right, speaking of some interesting news about nutrition and chemicals and neurological development, we've got a great little parody coming up for you here, a satire commercial on Obama Bites.
[00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:24.774]  Yes, this is the fictional nutritional supplement that Obama wants you to take because one a day keeps freedom away.
[00:06:24.894 --> 00:06:27.917]  It's made in China, and let's take a look at the Obama Bites commercial.
[00:06:30.842 --> 00:06:32.303]  Is freedom getting you down?
[00:06:32.783 --> 00:06:34.364]  You need Obama Bites!
[00:06:34.585 --> 00:06:35.225]  Obama Bites?
[00:06:35.505 --> 00:06:36.466]  Yeah, Obama Bites!
[00:06:38.687 --> 00:06:41.569]  It's got vitamins and minerals that you've never even heard of!
[00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:43.811]  Like vitamin B, afraid of everything!
[00:06:44.211 --> 00:06:46.032]  Vitamin C, something, say something!
[00:06:46.372 --> 00:06:48.674]  And vitamin D, destroy the Constitution!
[00:06:49.094 --> 00:06:53.437]  It's all found right here in Obama Bites, including these amazing trace minerals!
[00:06:53.957 --> 00:07:03.002]  Obomnesium, Squeezium, Germanium, Ridiculum, Hypnolium, Dystopium, Californium, Fukushimium, and Feinsteinium.
[00:07:03.202 --> 00:07:07.945]  The most amazing mineral of all, because it turns a female gargoyle into a U.S.
[00:07:07.985 --> 00:07:08.365]  Senator.
[00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:13.470]  Obama Bites!
[00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:15.311]  Plus, it's all made in China.
[00:07:15.611 --> 00:07:17.252]  There's a lot of good stuff from China, right?
[00:07:17.552 --> 00:07:21.934]  Like cancer villages, and suicide nets, and rivers that are on fire with petrochemical pollution!
[00:07:21.954 --> 00:07:28.678]  And it's got extra GMOs that are hidden inside so they don't bother you with the label or something like information.
[00:07:28.978 --> 00:07:30.359]  Obama Bites!
[00:07:30.999 --> 00:07:40.242]  Plus, unlike any other product in the market, Obama Bites helps you maintain your sheepishness, so you can fit in with the rest of the liberals who go along with everything they're told.
[00:07:40.262 --> 00:07:42.182]  Oooh, it's spooky!
[00:07:42.342 --> 00:07:43.423]  It's Obama Bites!
[00:07:43.743 --> 00:07:45.083]  Obama Bites!
[00:07:45.863 --> 00:07:47.384]  Check out Obama Bites!
[00:07:47.724 --> 00:07:50.225]  With a special effect, see-through effect right here.
[00:07:50.505 --> 00:07:53.026]  And if you do, you might be as cool as these guys are.
[00:07:53.366 --> 00:07:53.846]  Yeah!
[00:07:54.406 --> 00:07:55.207]  Obama Bites!
[00:07:55.648 --> 00:07:57.310]  One a day keeps freedom away!
[00:07:57.650 --> 00:07:58.991]  I'm Barack Obama and I approve this message.
[00:08:09.329 --> 00:08:09.649]  The U.S.
[00:08:09.689 --> 00:08:14.834]  Supreme Court has ruled that American citizens cannot challenge surveillance laws.
[00:08:16.135 --> 00:08:17.516]  You just have to swallow it.
[00:08:17.816 --> 00:08:20.258]  Kind of like Obama bites, right?
[00:08:20.558 --> 00:08:34.290]  Yeah, in a 5-4 decision, a majority of the justices recently threw out a bid by a group of lawyers, journalists, and organizations to challenge a 2008 expansion of the so-called Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA.
[00:08:35.436 --> 00:08:47.967]  And the justices threw this out because they said that the citizens could not prove the government would monitor their conversations in addition to those of potential intelligence targets.
[00:08:48.368 --> 00:08:50.349]  So now, let me see if I have this straight.
[00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:54.973]  The government monitors your email, your phone calls, your bank accounts.
[00:08:56.335 --> 00:09:01.099]  It's completely unconstitutional, but you can't challenge it in the judicial system?
[00:09:02.059 --> 00:09:02.379]  Hmm.
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:21.898]  Something tells me Jesse Ventura might have something to say about that because the same thing happened to him and his lawsuit against the TSA reaching down his pants and conducting some business that they shouldn't have been conducting on a man that doesn't deserve that kind of a treatment in a nation that he has helped fight for, by the way.
[00:09:22.539 --> 00:09:23.900]  So, there you go.
[00:09:24.921 --> 00:09:26.303]  I can't make this stuff up.
[00:09:26.443 --> 00:09:27.784]  Let's just move on.
[00:09:27.804 --> 00:09:37.074]  Alright, the next bit of insane news is an Obama supporter who has said that self-defense is not an option.
[00:09:37.114 --> 00:09:39.697]  This is a video captured by CBS Atlanta.
[00:09:40.277 --> 00:09:46.103]  Obama's supporter argues that she would rather die than protect herself in self-defense.
[00:09:46.163 --> 00:09:47.465]  Let's take a look at that clip.
[00:09:47.921 --> 00:09:51.603]  Florida's Stand Your Ground law is at the center of the Trayvon Martin shooting.
[00:09:52.083 --> 00:09:53.504]  Georgia has a similar law.
[00:09:53.984 --> 00:09:55.865]  Demonstrators here want to abolish it.
[00:09:56.265 --> 00:09:57.906]  Self-defense is not an option.
[00:09:58.686 --> 00:09:59.786]  It is not an option.
[00:09:59.906 --> 00:10:06.329]  The Stand Your Ground law provides immunity from prosecution if you kill someone and can prove you were defending yourself.
[00:10:06.549 --> 00:10:07.770]  But what if someone's trying to kill you?
[00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:09.671]  You just have to kill the person.
[00:10:10.373 --> 00:10:11.654]  Wow, there you go.
[00:10:11.674 --> 00:10:13.596]  That's some interesting logic.
[00:10:14.296 --> 00:10:32.651]  Unfortunately, to the person that was just saying that, there are lots and lots of people in government that would be happy to fulfill your wish of killing you, and they do it through vaccines, and they do it through food, they do it through the food additives, the, you know, all the chemicals, the heavy metals, the aspartame, the GMOs.
[00:10:33.892 --> 00:10:37.254]  Unfortunately, you're going to get your wish not in the way that you expected.
[00:10:37.274 --> 00:10:41.077]  You're going to get it through the government literally killing you.
[00:10:42.138 --> 00:10:42.758]  Sad to say.
[00:10:42.778 --> 00:10:46.941]  I don't know about you all, but for me, self-defense is always an option.
[00:10:48.282 --> 00:10:49.963]  That's my right.
[00:10:50.003 --> 00:10:51.044]  That's my divine right.
[00:10:51.144 --> 00:10:55.507]  Now, I'm not going to pull out the Glock and start blasting people right away.
[00:10:56.247 --> 00:11:07.274]  If it's my last-ditch option, if I can't motivate somebody to leave on their own and stop threatening me or a family member or someone else, then I will invoke self-defense.
[00:11:07.635 --> 00:11:10.857]  That should always be my option, and it is your option, too.
[00:11:11.097 --> 00:11:13.318]  It's an option that's protected under the Bill of Rights.
[00:11:13.599 --> 00:11:17.541]  The Second Amendment gives us that option eternally.
[00:11:17.941 --> 00:11:18.522]  You got that?
[00:11:18.782 --> 00:11:19.863]  We always have that option.
[00:11:19.923 --> 00:11:20.263]  All right.
[00:11:21.043 --> 00:11:24.145]  Well, by the way, that is the quote of the day, too, is self-defense.
[00:11:25.229 --> 00:11:28.251]  Is not an option, she says, quote of the day.
[00:11:28.631 --> 00:11:30.272]  Self-defense is not an option.
[00:11:30.892 --> 00:11:32.033]  What if someone's trying to kill you?
[00:11:32.513 --> 00:11:34.114]  You just have to kill the person.
[00:11:34.514 --> 00:11:35.555]  You just can't beat that.
[00:11:35.615 --> 00:11:36.936]  Self-defense is not an option?
[00:11:37.556 --> 00:11:37.856]  Really?
[00:11:38.557 --> 00:11:39.037]  For who?
[00:11:39.818 --> 00:11:41.599]  It's an option for me.
[00:11:41.619 --> 00:11:44.340]  Alright, next news item.
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:47.302]  DHS censors information about firearms purchases.
[00:11:47.342 --> 00:11:51.404]  This is an interesting story by Paul Joseph Watson, posted on InfoWars.com.
[00:11:52.865 --> 00:11:59.268]  Alright, so the Department of Homeland Security got tired of people like Paul Watson actually reading their numbers.
[00:11:59.669 --> 00:12:12.095]  Apparently, numbers are just too informative in this administration, so they've started to eliminate the numbers and black out the parts of the bid requests that they don't want you to read.
[00:12:12.415 --> 00:12:19.719]  You're not allowed to know what the government is buying with your money so they can acquire equipment to be used against you.
[00:12:21.654 --> 00:12:24.176]  And right, self-defense is not an option in that context?
[00:12:24.416 --> 00:12:24.716]  Really?
[00:12:25.096 --> 00:12:25.777]  Are you kidding me?
[00:12:26.597 --> 00:12:36.003]  In any case, apparently the government has been so embarrassed by the reporting at Infowars.com that they've decided to just start hiding everything, sweeping it under the rug.
[00:12:36.063 --> 00:12:38.945]  So now we're buying X number of bullets.
[00:12:39.685 --> 00:12:46.089]  We're buying X number of full automatic assault rifles for immigration and custom enforcement.
[00:12:46.709 --> 00:12:47.370]  How would you like that?
[00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:48.651]  Fill in the blank.
[00:12:49.511 --> 00:12:52.313]  Just let your imagination run wild, alright?
[00:12:52.953 --> 00:12:56.555]  No matter how many bullets you think the government is buying, they're buying more.
[00:12:56.795 --> 00:12:57.356]  Believe me.
[00:12:57.916 --> 00:12:59.837]  One billion, two billion, three billion.
[00:13:00.117 --> 00:13:01.918]  How about a billion bullets a week?
[00:13:02.379 --> 00:13:03.439]  That's probably what they're buying.
[00:13:03.759 --> 00:13:07.982]  Because even as Sarah Palin said recently on a Facebook post, the U.S.
[00:13:08.022 --> 00:13:11.764]  government is arming up against you.
[00:13:16.388 --> 00:13:20.690]  A weapons race, an armament race that's happening in America.
[00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:23.891]  As the citizens are arming up, the government's arming up as well.
[00:13:24.532 --> 00:13:29.895]  God only knows where this is all going, but I tell you, self-defense is always an option.
[00:13:30.635 --> 00:13:45.871]  All right, now let's go to a quick break here, take a break, and then we're also going to show you some information about ProPure, and we'll come back from that with an interview with Jim Mars about the suppression of knowledge throughout human history.
[00:13:45.991 --> 00:13:47.473]  So stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:58.046]  Well, if you're familiar with ProPure, you know it's already the best gravity feed filter in the market, but it just got better.
[00:13:58.547 --> 00:14:02.631]  And here to tell us about today is Steve Steinway, the founder and owner of ProPure.
[00:14:02.951 --> 00:14:03.512]  Steve, welcome.
[00:14:03.932 --> 00:14:04.873]  Thank you very much, David.
[00:14:04.893 --> 00:14:05.534]  Nice to be here.
[00:14:05.994 --> 00:14:11.059]  We want to hear all about this change in the filters, but first tell us a little bit about how you got started in this.
[00:14:11.079 --> 00:14:12.781]  I always love to hear entrepreneur stories.
[00:14:12.921 --> 00:14:29.187]  Sure, I've been in the preparedness business for several years selling different types of preparedness products including water filter systems and over the years with supply chain problems and an opportunity to
[00:14:31.048 --> 00:14:38.613]  See, if we could put together a better gravity water filter system, that's what motivated me to develop the ProPure system.
[00:14:38.754 --> 00:14:39.554]  You certainly did that.
[00:14:40.034 --> 00:14:44.457]  What I think is interesting is that you did it in the midst of a really bad economy.
[00:14:44.517 --> 00:14:46.519]  I mean, you're in Detroit, one of the worst places there.
[00:14:46.559 --> 00:14:53.964]  Maybe because of that, you saw the problems and realized that, you know, there's going to be a market out there for preparedness as the infrastructure collapses.
[00:14:54.144 --> 00:14:54.664]  Definitely.
[00:14:54.945 --> 00:15:04.452]  And, you know, again, economy in Detroit was bad, saw opportunity, and that's what motivated me to set out to develop ProPure.
[00:15:04.672 --> 00:15:04.872]  Right.
[00:15:05.093 --> 00:15:12.278]  And even if we don't have an economic collapse, we've got a situation where our complex infrastructure is already putting some pretty nasty stuff in our water.
[00:15:12.759 --> 00:15:14.300]  And that's what it's about.
[00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:19.644]  It's about staying clean and healthy, even if we don't have some kind of an emergency disaster that we've got to worry about.
[00:15:19.804 --> 00:15:26.667]  Absolutely, and the thing about the ProPure system is you can use it for daily use, whether it's with tap water.
[00:15:27.167 --> 00:15:30.148]  You can save it for an emergency or preparedness.
[00:15:30.669 --> 00:15:36.091]  You can use it with just about any water source, including lake, stream, river, or pond water.
[00:15:36.111 --> 00:15:36.791]  Oh, that's great.
[00:15:37.171 --> 00:15:38.912]  Well, tell us how this has changed now.
[00:15:38.952 --> 00:15:45.575]  What I was interested in seeing, too, is that even though you've got a major upgrade in the filters, it's still compatible if somebody's got the ProPure filter.
[00:15:45.615 --> 00:15:46.475]  You made that compatible.
[00:15:46.495 --> 00:15:47.536]  Tell us what you did to change it.
[00:15:47.996 --> 00:16:02.245]  Well, the original, our flagship filter, our ProBlack D-Dome Filter, along with our ProBlack Plus Fluoride Filter, again, was our original filter system that we developed with ProPure.
[00:16:03.005 --> 00:16:15.153]  And it's a two-stage, two-filter system, meaning the ProBlack D-Dome Filter mounts in the upper container, and then the fluoride filter screws on to the bottom.
[00:16:16.494 --> 00:16:17.637]  And it's a great system.
[00:16:24.278 --> 00:16:30.003]  But talking to people, I spend a lot of time on the front line talking to customers.
[00:16:30.384 --> 00:16:46.759]  We sensed perhaps an opportunity for us to sit out to see if we could develop a filter that was, one, easier to use and had greater performance than our original flagship filter system.
[00:16:47.379 --> 00:16:48.421]  Tell us about that performance.
[00:16:48.661 --> 00:16:49.522]  What changed on it?
[00:16:49.542 --> 00:16:55.970]  Because I know it filters some things that your previous filters didn't catch and other filters on the market don't catch.
[00:16:56.651 --> 00:17:00.736]  The important thing about the Pro-1 filter today is that the
[00:17:01.872 --> 00:17:12.255]  Material we use for removing fluoride and other heavy metals now will remove the latest form of fluoride called hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:17:12.695 --> 00:17:18.197]  There's no other fluoride reduction filter out there that will remove that type of fluoride.
[00:17:18.577 --> 00:17:27.960]  It's extremely important because today we're hearing more and more cities are using that form of fluoride rather than the traditional form.
[00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:31.642]  Yeah, it's sad that we have to pay to have that stuff put in.
[00:17:32.082 --> 00:17:40.926]  People get upset about Obamacare coming along and forcing medication on us or health care on us, but we've been having medication forced on us through the water system for quite a while.
[00:17:40.986 --> 00:17:42.567]  Most people don't realize it.
[00:17:42.607 --> 00:17:49.251]  Most people don't realize the negative effects of fluoride, although scientific studies are now coming out and a lot of people are changing.
[00:17:49.451 --> 00:17:52.492]  A lot of countries in Europe, New Zealand, are changing.
[00:17:52.532 --> 00:17:57.175]  They understand how harmful it is, but the word just hasn't gotten out in the U.S.
[00:17:57.195 --> 00:17:57.795]  for a lot of people.
[00:17:58.135 --> 00:18:03.980]  And it's just all about educating the consumer, you know, the importance of removing fluoride from water.
[00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:06.101]  So what are some of the effects of fluoride?
[00:18:06.301 --> 00:18:10.685]  There are many adverse effects of fluoride that the media tends to keep quiet.
[00:18:11.025 --> 00:18:14.908]  Well, the media keeps it quiet, but we've got someone who wrote an entire book on this.
[00:18:14.948 --> 00:18:18.751]  This is Dr. Paul Conant, wrote an entire book on the problems of fluoride.
[00:18:19.231 --> 00:18:22.614]  We carry this at InfoWarsStore.com and he's actually been in studio.
[00:18:22.974 --> 00:18:24.956]  Let's take a look at that interview with Dr. Paul Conant.
[00:18:25.376 --> 00:18:30.520]  I think the most important thing to recognize about fluoride is that it's extremely toxic.
[00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:36.664]  It is very active biologically, interfering with many basic biochemical processes.
[00:18:37.425 --> 00:18:41.027]  Enzymes, G-proteins, hydrogen bonds and so on.
[00:18:41.087 --> 00:18:48.433]  So it shouldn't surprise us that there's a wide range of health effects that are attributed to fluoride.
[00:18:48.633 --> 00:18:49.634]  Dental fluorosis.
[00:18:50.154 --> 00:18:55.741]  Fluoride causes a discoloration, mottling of the tooth enamel.
[00:18:56.242 --> 00:19:05.493]  The next concern is as the fluoride continues to build up in the bone, and I should say that up to 50% of all the fluoride that we take in each day accumulates in the bone.
[00:19:05.513 --> 00:19:07.195]  The fluoride is bioaccumulative.
[00:19:08.277 --> 00:19:09.298]  The bones get more brittle.
[00:19:09.518 --> 00:19:14.724]  There have now been over a hundred animal studies which shows that fluoride damages the brain.
[00:19:15.164 --> 00:19:28.879]  There have also been 23 IQ studies, most of them from China, but one from India, one from Iran, and one from Mexico, which show an association between moderate exposure to fluoride and lowered IQ in children.
[00:19:29.179 --> 00:19:36.768]  And once again, as in many of these other issues, the fluoridating countries, including the United States, are simply not doing the studies.
[00:19:37.089 --> 00:19:47.140]  They're not investigating to see if there's a relationship between fluoridation and lowered IQ, fluoridation and arthritis, fluoridation and hyperthyroidism.
[00:19:47.461 --> 00:19:47.861]  Another
[00:19:48.422 --> 00:19:58.170]  The first issue that came out in 1997 was a researcher in England found that fluoride accumulated in the human pineal gland.
[00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:04.035]  And the pineal gland is a little gland between the two parts of the brain, the two hemispheres of the brain.
[00:20:04.455 --> 00:20:06.557]  It's not protected by the blood-brain barrier.
[00:20:07.058 --> 00:20:13.123]  It has a high perfusion rate of blood and it also is a calcifying tissue like the teeth
[00:20:13.763 --> 00:20:14.424]  And the bones.
[00:20:14.464 --> 00:20:32.741]  The average level of fluoride on these little calcium hydroxyapatite crystals was 9,000 parts per million, up to 21,000 parts per million, which means that this little gland has a higher concentration of fluoride than any other tissue in the body, including the bone.
[00:20:33.061 --> 00:20:35.142]  Well, that's not something I would want in my water.
[00:20:35.483 --> 00:20:38.745]  And it bothers me that I'm forced by the government to pay for that.
[00:20:38.945 --> 00:20:40.406]  But they can't force me to drink it.
[00:20:40.746 --> 00:20:42.427]  Not if I take control of my own health.
[00:20:42.467 --> 00:20:46.150]  And that's what you can do if you get a Pro-Pure filter that filters that out.
[00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:48.972]  Now, tell us a little bit about your design goals here.
[00:20:48.992 --> 00:20:51.754]  This is something that was pretty difficult for you to get manufactured.
[00:20:51.774 --> 00:20:53.074]  Why are you kind of pushing the state-of-the-art?
[00:20:53.395 --> 00:20:56.156]  Well, this is our flagship filter.
[00:20:56.277 --> 00:21:01.340]  Our Pro-Black D Dome Filter with our Pro-Black Plus Fluoride Filter.
[00:21:03.281 --> 00:21:07.385]  With fluoride filters there are basically two technologies.
[00:21:07.925 --> 00:21:11.789]  One that's alumina based and one that is activated carbon based.
[00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:21.598]  Our filter uses the activated carbon based technology mainly because there's nothing that leaches out into the water.
[00:21:21.958 --> 00:21:26.602]  There's no alumina or aluminum which can be harmful and
[00:21:27.703 --> 00:21:27.903]  I think?
[00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:57.453]  We developed the Pro-1 filter, which combines both our primary filter and our fluoride filter in an all-in-one filter element.
[00:21:57.793 --> 00:22:00.634]  It's very easy to use, very easy to install.
[00:22:00.914 --> 00:22:03.775]  There's nothing that hangs down into the lower container.
[00:22:04.115 --> 00:22:08.097]  This mounts in the upper container of the Pro-Pure systems.
[00:22:08.877 --> 00:22:11.898]  And you actually improved the filtration of this, the new filter.
[00:22:12.018 --> 00:22:28.841]  Yes, with the new Pro-1 filter, not only does it do everything that the Pro-Black D and our Pro-Black Plus Fluoride filters, but in addition, it also removes the latest form of fluoride called hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:22:29.261 --> 00:22:37.223]  And to be clear, when people have to replace their older filters, they'll still be able to use this new filter in the Pro-Pure system, and it will cost a little bit less.
[00:22:37.503 --> 00:22:38.063]  Absolutely.
[00:22:38.224 --> 00:22:50.432]  The Pro-1 filters are available in three different sizes, and we have them designed to fit all of the ProPure systems, whether you have a previous purchase system or you're purchasing a new system today.
[00:22:50.912 --> 00:22:54.875]  So when you're creating these new filters, it's not just a manufacturing issue.
[00:22:54.895 --> 00:22:57.376]  You've also got to do some testing and qualification.
[00:22:57.416 --> 00:22:59.578]  What kind of certification and qualification does it have?
[00:22:59.678 --> 00:23:04.241]  There's a lot of testing that goes into making water filter elements.
[00:23:06.511 --> 00:23:22.012]  The engineering team that we used when we developed our flagship, the ProBlack D and our ProBlack Plus Fluorides, are the same team of engineers that have worked with me to develop the ProOne filter system.
[00:23:22.953 --> 00:23:32.481]  Combining a ceramic filter that's silver impregnated with a new type of activated carbon was extremely challenging.
[00:23:33.722 --> 00:23:44.691]  We searched around the world trying to find a supplier that could meet our specifications and build the filter to our design and we're fortunate enough to find a company in England
[00:23:45.191 --> 00:23:45.771]  That's great.
[00:23:45.791 --> 00:23:48.532]  Now you've also got another innovation that's coming up too.
[00:23:48.672 --> 00:23:49.593]  That's your laser etching.
[00:23:49.673 --> 00:23:50.453]  That's kind of cool.
[00:24:00.737 --> 00:24:14.901]  We're working on a decorative design that would be laser etched around the surface of the stainless steel containers, would be the upper, the lower, and possibly laser etched design on the lid.
[00:24:15.281 --> 00:24:17.161]  Again, it's decorative.
[00:24:17.881 --> 00:24:23.223]  We're looking at maybe three or four different patterns and just a nice upscale look.
[00:24:23.888 --> 00:24:24.529]  That's great.
[00:24:24.569 --> 00:24:25.529]  That's great.
[00:24:25.549 --> 00:24:26.990]  Well, that's what makes your systems great.
[00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:29.512]  You never are satisfied to just stay in one place.
[00:24:29.933 --> 00:24:36.758]  You're making, it's like Steve Jobs always said, either you're going to make your own product obsolete or you're going to have somebody else make it obsolete for you.
[00:24:36.798 --> 00:24:40.501]  So you just keep innovating just like the best of them out there.
[00:24:40.581 --> 00:24:43.723]  And again, like I said before, that's what Propeer is all about.
[00:24:43.763 --> 00:24:49.468]  We're not going to just sit still with one technology, not sit still with just one look.
[00:24:49.568 --> 00:24:53.191]  We're always looking to improve and enhance the performance and the look of our systems.
[00:24:53.331 --> 00:24:53.771]  That's great.
[00:24:53.911 --> 00:24:54.291]  That's great.
[00:24:54.351 --> 00:24:56.733]  We're all excited about these new changes that came out for this year.
[00:24:57.133 --> 00:24:58.094]  And these things are brand new.
[00:24:58.274 --> 00:25:00.635]  Actually, the laser stuff is just about to roll out.
[00:25:00.675 --> 00:25:06.299]  We're just about ready to launch our laser etch program, and we're very excited to release that.
[00:25:06.759 --> 00:25:10.302]  I think people will find it to be a nice decorative addition to their countertop.
[00:25:10.462 --> 00:25:10.902]  That's great.
[00:25:10.942 --> 00:25:14.825]  So, bottom line, why should somebody get this new Pro1 ProPure filter?
[00:25:15.819 --> 00:25:31.563]  The reason to buy the Pro-1, it's an all-in-one filter, it's convenient, easy to use, it doesn't require the add-on fluoride filter, and in addition, this filter removes the latest form of fluoride called hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:25:32.343 --> 00:25:39.085]  Well, you can find all these great new products, the new filters, the laser-etched canisters, you can find all that at InfoWarsShop.com.
[00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:41.943]  Please go there, help to support our operation.
[00:25:41.963 --> 00:25:43.105]  We're entrepreneurs too, you know.
[00:25:43.546 --> 00:25:46.231]  We're in the information business, but we have to support it.
[00:25:46.812 --> 00:25:52.261]  And you can help us as well as providing clean, safe water for your family at InfoWarsShop.com.
[00:26:13.601 --> 00:26:25.126]  Ladies and gentlemen, got up this morning to come in here and take a shower and found something, well, here in the bathroom in Austin, Texas.
[00:26:25.186 --> 00:26:26.767]  We run into these quite often.
[00:26:27.267 --> 00:26:28.868]  Sometimes they get in the bed with you.
[00:26:28.888 --> 00:26:31.369]  Is it a scorpion?
[00:26:32.009 --> 00:26:33.410]  Is it a centipede?
[00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:35.650]  Is it a frog?
[00:26:36.431 --> 00:26:38.152]  Is it a tarantula?
[00:26:39.052 --> 00:26:41.193]  Is it a gremlin gizmo?
[00:26:41.994 --> 00:26:44.174]  Who is behind door number one?
[00:26:44.195 --> 00:26:48.115]  Who will be going into that container right there?
[00:26:48.335 --> 00:27:01.718]  Ladies and gentlemen, prepare yourselves for, drumroll please, the giant Texas red-headed centipede!
[00:27:03.859 --> 00:27:05.239]  And I guess he went into sleepy mode.
[00:27:05.279 --> 00:27:08.760]  I guess when I put this over him there was a little thing of cream or something there.
[00:27:12.356 --> 00:27:13.276]  Hey bud, come on.
[00:27:14.177 --> 00:27:15.097]  Yeah, let's go in there.
[00:27:16.137 --> 00:27:19.858]  Of course, I probably didn't think that there was, might have been soap in this container.
[00:27:19.898 --> 00:27:20.558]  We'll wash him off.
[00:27:21.058 --> 00:27:26.960]  Okay, come on.
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:28.880]  Okay, there you go, pal.
[00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:30.501]  Now, that's a little one, folks.
[00:27:30.561 --> 00:27:31.701]  I get like twice that size.
[00:27:32.421 --> 00:27:35.722]  You go down to Deep Eddy, Nashville Poole, in the morning, come on,
[00:27:42.261 --> 00:27:42.521]  I don't know.
[00:28:05.316 --> 00:28:07.957]  I grabbed the first thing I had and I forgot that it had
[00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:35.470]  Soap in it.
[00:28:36.531 --> 00:28:37.531]  So I'm giving him a bath.
[00:28:39.252 --> 00:28:40.452]  This is part two of the video.
[00:28:40.492 --> 00:28:42.293]  Let's get our new pet.
[00:28:43.594 --> 00:28:48.936]  I know they like water because I've seen them run out and getting them water whenever the lifeguards are washing the steps at Deep Eddy.
[00:28:51.036 --> 00:28:51.397]  Do what?
[00:28:52.697 --> 00:28:53.978]  Oh yeah, you started videoing that again.
[00:28:53.998 --> 00:28:54.418]  Yeah, I'm sure.
[00:28:54.458 --> 00:28:54.738]  Go ahead.
[00:29:03.228 --> 00:29:04.129]  All right, welcome back.
[00:29:04.189 --> 00:29:20.538]  And next we have an interview with Jim Mars, the incredible researcher and author of a new book called Our Occulted History, which talks about forbidden knowledge, forbidden archaeology, and a lot of things that you are not allowed to know about but are revealed in his book.
[00:29:20.858 --> 00:29:23.800]  His book's available everywhere, Amazon.com, other places.
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:27.562]  And Jim Mars joins us now for InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:29:27.822 --> 00:29:29.623]  Jim, thanks for joining us today.
[00:29:30.003 --> 00:29:31.104]  It's great to have you on.
[00:29:32.125 --> 00:29:36.290]  Hey, Mike, it's always a pleasure to be on with a fellow truth seeker.
[00:29:36.971 --> 00:29:38.874]  Well, that's what we're all about, isn't it?
[00:29:38.914 --> 00:29:41.577]  Now, let me lead off with the raw milk issue.
[00:29:42.198 --> 00:29:50.768]  As you know, Iowa is now pushing for legalizing raw milk, which sounds absurd that it would be illegal in the first place.
[00:29:51.929 --> 00:29:52.829]  Well, I don't know.
[00:29:52.929 --> 00:29:56.871]  That, to me, is no more absurd than saying we're going to license firearms.
[00:29:56.991 --> 00:30:03.074]  I mean, the Constitution says the right to bear arms shall not be infringed, okay?
[00:30:03.114 --> 00:30:09.296]  So, you know, if you try to pass, you can pass all laws you want to, but they're null and void because they're unconstitutional.
[00:30:09.797 --> 00:30:12.738]  And when you say you can't sell milk, what the heck's that?
[00:30:13.058 --> 00:30:16.820]  And what do you think humans have been drinking for thousands of years, you know?
[00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:18.760]  Well, yeah.
[00:30:19.121 --> 00:30:20.821]  What's wrong with these insane people?
[00:30:20.961 --> 00:30:22.462]  But they're not insane.
[00:30:22.602 --> 00:30:29.284]  At the very top of the food chain are people who, bottom line is, they want us dead, okay?
[00:30:29.464 --> 00:30:33.906]  And you're going to read all about them in my book, Our Occulted History.
[00:30:34.326 --> 00:30:37.047]  By the way, I've been listening to your book on audiobook.
[00:30:37.167 --> 00:30:37.768]  It's amazing.
[00:30:37.788 --> 00:30:38.928]  You're a great researcher.
[00:30:38.948 --> 00:30:47.772]  I even told the New York Times, this is no joke, because they interviewed me about you, and I told them that you should be nominated for a Pulitzer Prize.
[00:30:48.172 --> 00:30:58.097]  They didn't put that in their article for whatever reason, but honestly, when you look at the research that's happening today across journalism, I don't see anybody doing the in-depth
[00:30:59.142 --> 00:31:06.252]  Fact-checking and compilation of research that you are doing consistently throughout all your books, going way back.
[00:31:07.458 --> 00:31:37.318]  Well, I guess that's because I was trained as a journalist back in the old republic when we really got an education, you know, and they, I know in journalism school at University of North Texas, I was taught, look behind the facile official pronouncements and try to dig and try to find out what the truth is and put it in a context and then present it to your readers and let them decide, you know, if they want to put up with all of that or if there's something needs to be done about it.
[00:31:37.418 --> 00:31:46.088]  Well yeah, but today, look at Bob Woodward, who is now starting to speak out against Obama, and he's being absolutely vilified and attacked.
[00:31:46.468 --> 00:31:51.714]  There's even Obama supporters saying that they hope Woodward dies now because he's speaking out against Obama.
[00:31:52.034 --> 00:31:54.877]  So asking a question now means you're put on an enemies list.
[00:31:55.697 --> 00:31:56.918]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:31:56.998 --> 00:32:06.364]  And if you're on the enemy's list, then you know that fateful Tuesday may roll around when the president goes down the list and decides he can target you for assassination.
[00:32:07.104 --> 00:32:13.708]  You know, with no court trial, no lawyer, no representation, no confronting your accusers.
[00:32:14.069 --> 00:32:22.334]  I mean, the Constitution is being trashed right and left, and the people who support all this have no clue what's fixing to come down on them.
[00:32:22.574 --> 00:32:35.277]  You know, that's very true that due process is thrown out the window, but getting back to the raw milk issue, we also see that reflected there, happening there, where people are accused by a regulatory body, which typically includes the FDA.
[00:32:35.697 --> 00:32:52.220]  The FDA was granted essentially unlimited power by Congress to make rules and laws, essentially regulations, that are unconstitutional and that are enforced completely outside of law, outside the judicial system or checks and balances.
[00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:55.202]  So, we're seeing runaway tyranny.
[00:32:55.502 --> 00:32:57.723]  Attorney Jonathan E. Moore warned us about this.
[00:32:58.063 --> 00:33:00.045]  Where do you think it's headed, Jim?
[00:33:00.105 --> 00:33:05.968]  I mean, is 2013 the last year that we're going to have America, or the United States of America?
[00:33:06.088 --> 00:33:06.949]  Where is this going?
[00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:11.874]  Well, we're heading for an Orwellian future, okay?
[00:33:12.535 --> 00:33:31.393]  I was reading this morning that going back actually to about 2006, because of the phony war on terrorism, and I say phony because with the exception of 9-11, there's never been another terrorist story pop up that did not involve an FBI informant or a CIA informant.
[00:33:31.733 --> 00:33:37.996]  In other words, government agents provocateur in there creating all this stuff, right?
[00:33:38.056 --> 00:33:50.223]  But going back in 2006, they extended the jurisdiction of the Border Patrol to a hundred miles inside any border with a foreign country or the coastlines.
[00:33:50.623 --> 00:33:58.167]  Now that takes in two-thirds of the population of the United States and already they're starting to set up highway checkpoints.
[00:33:58.527 --> 00:33:58.767]  Right.
[00:33:58.787 --> 00:33:59.047]  Okay?
[00:33:59.267 --> 00:34:03.770]  Now this is nothing more than the old Nazis, show me your papers stuff, you know?
[00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:23.259]  And the TSA is trying to get in on the act because they're already trying to set up and grope people at bus stations, and now they're talking about adding the TSA to these checkpoints, so you try to drive on the freeway, you're going to go see grandma, you get stopped and frisked, and the kids get groped, you know?
[00:34:23.519 --> 00:34:26.260]  This is insane, folks, and we're putting up with it.
[00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:31.043]  We're just putting up with it because of the bad food and water, and we're back to the milk!
[00:34:31.263 --> 00:34:32.364]  And think about this, Jim.
[00:34:33.004 --> 00:34:37.387]  The TSA is only one false flag event away from being armed.
[00:34:37.707 --> 00:34:53.216]  Now these people who take no oath, they don't have any real police or law enforcement training, they respect no rights whatsoever, they operate in a constitution-free zone, essentially in the airport, they don't respect any rights, they are pedophiles on the record,
[00:34:53.556 --> 00:34:55.518]  They are child porn dealers.
[00:34:55.818 --> 00:34:56.839]  They are drug dealers.
[00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:57.660]  They are thieves.
[00:34:58.021 --> 00:34:59.322]  They are crooks.
[00:34:59.762 --> 00:35:02.946]  They are the scum of the earth in uniform.
[00:35:03.306 --> 00:35:06.670]  They're going to be given guns and unleashed on our roads.
[00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:11.234]  Now to me, the key point is, how many terrorists have they caught?
[00:35:11.675 --> 00:35:13.637]  And the answer is... None!
[00:35:14.398 --> 00:35:14.998]  Zero!
[00:35:15.038 --> 00:35:15.399]  Zip!
[00:35:15.679 --> 00:35:16.119]  Matter!
[00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:17.260]  Niche.
[00:35:17.761 --> 00:35:18.181]  Nothing.
[00:35:18.421 --> 00:35:18.781]  None.
[00:35:19.062 --> 00:35:19.442]  Okay.
[00:35:19.662 --> 00:35:31.610]  Now, in a thoughtful, balanced, sane society, you would say, well, we've had these freaks for ten years, and all they've done is caused tremendous public upset, got everybody mad.
[00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:38.935]  They have, like you said, they've been caught pedophilia, they've been caught thieving, they've been caught lying, they've been caught everything.
[00:35:38.955 --> 00:35:41.116]  They got filled with scum of the earth.
[00:35:41.216 --> 00:35:42.977]  Not all, but many of them.
[00:35:43.618 --> 00:35:46.660]  Why can't we simply say, hey, it was a good idea, but it didn't work?
[00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:49.001]  And disband the Sons of Guns.
[00:35:49.041 --> 00:35:50.622]  Well, that's the point.
[00:35:51.242 --> 00:35:57.864]  The government says that if you as an individual, if you have a record, a criminal record, then you're stripped of all your rights and powers.
[00:35:58.185 --> 00:36:09.929]  Well, why can't we say that if a government agency is caught and has a record of being pedophiles and crooks and thieves and liars, then they lose all of their so-called rights and powers.
[00:36:09.969 --> 00:36:11.930]  We should disband the TSA.
[00:36:12.350 --> 00:36:13.411]  We should disband it.
[00:36:14.329 --> 00:36:14.950]  Absolutely.
[00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:15.891]  It's that simple.
[00:36:15.971 --> 00:36:30.710]  Just say, well, it didn't work, didn't call anybody, and we're doing away with this, and we should return airport security to the airlines, where it should have been in the first place, because they are business people, and they're in the business of making money.
[00:36:31.090 --> 00:36:36.574]  And they're going to do whatever's necessary to make sure that the airports are secure and that their flights are secure.
[00:36:36.874 --> 00:36:43.319]  And of course, the cheapest, easiest way to do that is to have a Sky Marshal undercover on each flight, packing heat.
[00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:47.883]  And if anybody causes trouble, he can just, you know, take charge of the situation.
[00:36:47.963 --> 00:36:48.964]  It's that simple folks.
[00:36:49.124 --> 00:36:49.804]  That's the thing, Jim.
[00:36:49.824 --> 00:36:50.885]  It's not rocket science.
[00:36:51.005 --> 00:36:54.368]  And by the way, stay focused on the camera.
[00:36:54.428 --> 00:36:55.549]  We can see you better.
[00:36:56.429 --> 00:36:57.611]  You're getting a little bit off screen there.
[00:36:57.631 --> 00:36:58.171]  Sorry I get excited.
[00:36:58.451 --> 00:36:59.192]  I know, I know.
[00:36:59.232 --> 00:36:59.933]  Well, we all do.
[00:36:59.953 --> 00:37:05.840]  But I want to fly on open carry airlines, where everybody's armed.
[00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:08.022]  Everybody that flies is armed.
[00:37:08.522 --> 00:37:09.263]  We're all armed.
[00:37:09.283 --> 00:37:11.165]  It's going to be the safest flight in the sky.
[00:37:11.946 --> 00:37:15.009]  Hey, that was my ideas all the way back into the 60s.
[00:37:15.169 --> 00:37:15.650]  Really?
[00:37:16.631 --> 00:37:20.715]  Yeah, well let me tell you, let's look at the history of hijacking, alright?
[00:37:20.795 --> 00:37:26.862]  It started off with Cubans hijacking airliners and saying, take me to America.
[00:37:27.342 --> 00:37:33.125]  Okay, and this was back in the early 60s, right after Castro took over Cuba in 1959.
[00:37:33.205 --> 00:37:45.251]  Now, if at that point we said, well, we sympathize with you, but you're an air pirate, and we had tried them, and better yet, sent them back to Cuba for trial, it would have all stopped.
[00:37:45.651 --> 00:37:54.995]  But no, the United States accepted these Cubans and said, well, they're fleeing this communist regime, and so we accept them, and they were heroes.
[00:37:55.375 --> 00:37:56.456]  Well, the next thing you know...
[00:37:56.616 --> 00:38:10.051]  Yeah, so the next thing you know, a bunch of these Cubans that had all come over here and they couldn't get a job, they couldn't get their welfare check on time, and they got upset, so they started hijacking our airliners and saying, take me to Cuba!
[00:38:11.613 --> 00:38:17.276]  At that point it's like, oh my god, they're terrible hijackers, you know, after we just hailed them as heroes.
[00:38:17.736 --> 00:38:23.758]  And so that's when they started putting the x-ray machines and everything in the airports to try to stop that.
[00:38:24.019 --> 00:38:34.043]  They could have nipped it in the bud by saying, hey, air piracy is air piracy, and I'm sorry, we sympathize with you, but you're going to have to go back to Cuba and stand trial.
[00:38:34.323 --> 00:38:37.965]  But see, America, the arsenal of hypocrisy.
[00:38:38.285 --> 00:38:39.386]  Always a double standard.
[00:38:39.426 --> 00:38:40.307]  It's always a double standard.
[00:38:40.347 --> 00:38:42.569]  You know, the government can commit any crime whatsoever.
[00:38:42.629 --> 00:38:53.619]  Even the pharmaceutical companies can commit felony crimes, admit to it, and yet they can still do business with the government even though they are criminal operations from the top down.
[00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:56.282]  We've seen that across the pharmaceutical companies.
[00:38:56.702 --> 00:38:58.484]  So yeah, there's a massive double standard.
[00:38:59.184 --> 00:39:11.692]  But at the same time, individuals are criminalized for doing innocent behavior like homeschooling or saying no to vaccines or drinking or selling raw milk and raw cheese as we opened up with.
[00:39:12.433 --> 00:39:20.818]  And you don't have a bureaucrat show up with a piece of paper saying, you know, we think you need to stop selling this milk and still we can check.
[00:39:20.878 --> 00:39:27.462]  No, they send in armed SWAT teams as if they were raiding the Branch Davidian compound, right?
[00:39:27.822 --> 00:39:28.822]  This is just wrong!
[00:39:29.163 --> 00:39:29.703]  It's wrong!
[00:39:29.963 --> 00:39:33.004]  Well, and even the raid on the Branch Davidians was wrong.
[00:39:33.584 --> 00:39:36.225]  Nobody's standing up because they're all fluorided out.
[00:39:36.865 --> 00:39:46.429]  And all you have to do is study sodium fluoride and you find out that it attacks the thyroid and causes all kinds of problems, but mostly it dumbs you down and dulls you down.
[00:39:46.789 --> 00:39:55.332]  And we've got two-thirds of the people in this country now drinking fluoridated water, and I think that goes far in explaining why nobody seems to
[00:39:56.032 --> 00:39:58.034]  I don't give a crap anymore, you know?
[00:39:58.254 --> 00:40:02.378]  Plus, there's a concerted effort to destroy knowledge.
[00:40:02.538 --> 00:40:06.342]  There's this whole realm of forbidden knowledge, things we're not supposed to know about.
[00:40:06.942 --> 00:40:13.569]  And in the first few chapters of your book, you cover hidden archaeology, which I found really, really fascinating.
[00:40:14.009 --> 00:40:18.934]  Can you talk a little bit about this forbidden archaeology and the origins of humanity?
[00:40:20.009 --> 00:40:20.309]  Sure.
[00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:36.040]  First off, anyone who's kept up with the news, and particularly the Occupy movement, knows that the big argument is that there is a 1%, there's a small handful of people who are trying to control the world, control the United States, control the economy.
[00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:36.960]  All right.
[00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:52.528]  Well, what hasn't been mentioned is they also control knowledge because, number one, they own and have cross-ownership within the five major multinational corporations that control everything we see and hear.
[00:40:52.889 --> 00:41:01.193]  Not just news, but music and movies and TV and cable and billboards and magazines and books and book clubs.
[00:41:01.733 --> 00:41:02.754]  I'm telling everything.
[00:41:02.794 --> 00:41:08.897]  The largest publisher in the English language is Bertelsmann, the old publisher of Nazi propaganda.
[00:41:08.937 --> 00:41:10.058]  Really?
[00:41:10.078 --> 00:41:12.860]  A privately held company out of Germany.
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:13.660]  Okay?
[00:41:14.041 --> 00:41:16.082]  Largest publisher in the English language.
[00:41:16.122 --> 00:41:17.923]  They control almost all of them.
[00:41:18.003 --> 00:41:22.766]  Also, as you explain in your book, they have a monopoly on so-called science.
[00:41:23.166 --> 00:41:25.367]  So they have a scientific theory.
[00:41:25.387 --> 00:41:26.048]  Yeah, go ahead.
[00:41:27.105 --> 00:41:29.186]  Well, this is what I was getting to.
[00:41:29.326 --> 00:41:53.039]  Nobody realizes these are the same folks who control the banks, control the foundations, control the grant giving, the large grants that go to the education institutions, the academia, and this is why all you've got to do is get in a large university's archaeology department, and if you stray from the norm, if you say, hey, I think we're going to go look at this,
[00:41:53.399 --> 00:41:55.721]  Let's go look at hominems a million years ago.
[00:41:55.901 --> 00:41:56.161]  Uh-uh.
[00:41:56.361 --> 00:41:57.342]  No, you can't do that.
[00:41:57.462 --> 00:41:58.162]  No, uh-uh.
[00:41:58.583 --> 00:42:06.288]  If you want your doctorate degree, you know, if you want your PhD, you've got to stay within these confines.
[00:42:06.669 --> 00:42:09.731]  And they shape the knowledge we have.
[00:42:10.091 --> 00:42:22.460]  And so between their control over academia and their control over the government and their control over the mass media, this is why people don't have a clue as to what's really going on, where they came from or where we're going.
[00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:31.585]  Along with shaping the science, though, there's all this evidence that has been found in the archaeological record that doesn't fit in their box.
[00:42:31.625 --> 00:42:37.729]  So instead of figuring out a new theory or expanding their ideas, they simply dismiss it.
[00:42:37.769 --> 00:42:46.634]  You were talking about the Smithsonian Institution possibly having a giant system of hidden artifacts that they won't acknowledge even exist.
[00:42:46.814 --> 00:42:47.595]  Is that really true?
[00:42:49.142 --> 00:42:50.003]  Apparently so.
[00:42:50.203 --> 00:42:56.708]  I have newspaper clips going back into the 1800s where they were finding the skeletons of giant beings.
[00:42:56.868 --> 00:43:01.351]  I mean, you know, 15 feet tall, huge bones that they found.
[00:43:01.612 --> 00:43:08.677]  And they all end up with the Smithsonian and then they end up in the basement or in the, with the Ark of the Covenant in that warehouse.
[00:43:08.717 --> 00:43:10.538]  Right, it's like Indiana Jones.
[00:43:10.598 --> 00:43:14.619]  It's like Indiana Jones, and they hide away, and then they deny they even have anything.
[00:43:14.659 --> 00:43:27.684]  Now, what people don't understand is they think of the Smithsonian Institution as this great scientific institution, which it is, but what they don't understand is ever since the 1800s, it's been an official arm of the U.S.
[00:43:27.844 --> 00:43:28.344]  government.
[00:43:28.684 --> 00:43:28.885]  Sure.
[00:43:28.905 --> 00:43:32.151]  In other words, the government controls what you see and what you hear.
[00:43:32.472 --> 00:43:38.944]  And if it doesn't fit into the established agenda, then they hide it away and act like it's not there.
[00:43:39.636 --> 00:43:47.163]  Well yeah, if they control the science, and then they can control, essentially, the thoughts that people have about what is true.
[00:43:47.463 --> 00:43:54.429]  This is how they manage to inject children with mercury, MSG, formaldehyde in the form of vaccines.
[00:43:54.469 --> 00:44:01.095]  They just convince everybody that vaccines are medicine, and not an injection with toxic adjuvants and metals.
[00:44:01.736 --> 00:44:04.759]  And so people just fall for it, and they kill their babies.
[00:44:05.660 --> 00:44:05.860]  Yep.
[00:44:06.580 --> 00:44:07.561]  And that's been proven.
[00:44:07.581 --> 00:44:09.441]  That's not just some conspiracy theory.
[00:44:09.682 --> 00:44:11.182]  No, that's real science.
[00:44:11.862 --> 00:44:14.383]  Not the quack science that they use to push vaccines.
[00:44:14.663 --> 00:44:15.904]  We're almost out of time, Jim.
[00:44:18.105 --> 00:44:26.328]  Give us a real quick highlight of your book, Our Occulted History, and I want to encourage people to go to your website, jimmars.com, with two R's.
[00:44:26.708 --> 00:44:30.669]  So, J-I-M-M-A-R-S, jimmars.com.
[00:44:30.909 --> 00:44:34.791]  Give us a quick overview, Jim, in the minute or so that we have remaining.
[00:44:36.485 --> 00:45:01.418]  Well, what I've done here is tie two issues that are heretofore thought unrelated, and I've tied them together, and it really makes for a tremendous and foreboding picture, which is, namely, the one topic that you, particularly Alex Jones, talks about so frequently, and that is a small handful of people trying to run the economy and the world.
[00:45:02.018 --> 00:45:15.046]  And whether you call them the New World Order, or the Illuminati, or the 1%, or whatever you want to call them, but that seems to be an established issue that's being talked about all over the place.
[00:45:15.106 --> 00:45:27.894]  Now, what I've done is tie in one that most people think is unrelated, and that is the issue that has been gaining popularity now thanks to that TV series, Ancient Astronauts.
[00:45:27.934 --> 00:45:29.275]  Yeah, that's a good series.
[00:45:29.955 --> 00:45:37.401]  So, the question is, if there was these ancient extraterrestrials in our prehistory, did they leave or are they still here?
[00:45:37.822 --> 00:45:40.924]  Well, the evidence is... Hey, Jim, you're looking way off camera again, man.
[00:45:40.944 --> 00:45:42.125]  What happened?
[00:45:42.165 --> 00:45:45.428]  Sorry, I'm just... We're losing you.
[00:45:46.109 --> 00:45:48.471]  I'm not used to this modern technology.
[00:45:49.592 --> 00:45:57.259]  So, assuming that there were ancient astronauts in the past, then the question becomes, did they all leave or are some of them still here?
[00:45:57.279 --> 00:46:02.604]  Well, I think the answer is by taking a close look at human history.
[00:46:02.644 --> 00:46:08.009]  You know, if it's like we've been taught, it's just a slow evolutionary climb, but that's not what we find.
[00:46:08.050 --> 00:46:13.435]  We find the ancient Hindu writing, the Vedas talk about the Vamas, the flying machines,
[00:46:13.835 --> 00:46:15.937]  We got Ezekiel and his fiery wheel.
[00:46:15.977 --> 00:46:18.960]  We got the flying shields of the Romans that were reported.
[00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:26.488]  We come right on up to the airship mystery of 1896-97, which was years before the Wright Brothers ever flew.
[00:46:27.369 --> 00:46:31.994]  And then, of course, we've got UFOs, crop circles, the abduction, cattle mutilations.
[00:46:32.514 --> 00:46:33.636]  Somebody's still here.
[00:46:34.276 --> 00:46:37.059]  Well, if they're still here, who are they?
[00:46:37.099 --> 00:46:37.660]  What do they want?
[00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:40.443]  And I maintain they are the 1%.
[00:46:40.523 --> 00:46:46.830]  They are the small kernel at the top of the power pyramid that's trying to control the world.
[00:46:49.073 --> 00:46:57.038]  Well, that's a frightening idea, but there's a lot of evidence out there to support that, and folks, you'll find a lot of that in Jim Maher's book.
[00:46:57.058 --> 00:46:59.359]  So, Jeb, I want to thank you for joining us today.
[00:46:59.399 --> 00:47:00.940]  It's always fascinating talking with you.
[00:47:18.735 --> 00:47:19.819]  Hey, thanks a lot.
[00:47:19.959 --> 00:47:22.026]  We'll continue this at some future date.
[00:47:22.186 --> 00:47:22.507]  All right.
[00:47:22.567 --> 00:47:23.069]  Take care, Jim.
[00:47:25.031 --> 00:47:27.653]  All right, that's the broadcast for March 1st, 2013.
