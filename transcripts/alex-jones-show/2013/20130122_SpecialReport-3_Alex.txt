[00:00:04.932 --> 00:00:11.862]  Well, we've got one of our favorite guests, Gerald Salenti, beginning of the year, and we want to know what kind of trends he sees with his Trends Journal.
[00:00:11.902 --> 00:00:12.723]  Gerald, how are you doing?
[00:00:13.384 --> 00:00:15.186]  I'm great, thanks for having me on, David.
[00:00:15.447 --> 00:00:17.389]  What did you think about that coronation yesterday?
[00:00:18.353 --> 00:00:19.094]  Well, that's what it was.
[00:00:19.154 --> 00:00:20.034]  It was nobility.
[00:00:20.074 --> 00:00:23.737]  What a disgrace that this is going on in the United States.
[00:00:24.118 --> 00:00:29.482]  You know, my motto, by the way, is taught to me by my dear father, may his soul rest in peace.
[00:00:29.943 --> 00:00:35.367]  Anytime I'd be shooting my mouth off, he'd look at me and he'd say in Italian, papagalo, parrot.
[00:00:35.747 --> 00:00:36.688]  Think for yourself.
[00:00:36.768 --> 00:00:38.830]  Stop repeating what everybody else is saying.
[00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.512]  So what I have to say is only the way I see it.
[00:00:41.853 --> 00:00:43.534]  I'm not telling people what to believe.
[00:00:43.895 --> 00:00:46.777]  But what I saw was disgusting to me.
[00:00:47.198 --> 00:00:55.706]  Here they put on this lavish affair, bragging about all the designer clothes, rolling out the red carpets.
[00:00:56.266 --> 00:01:08.321]  The Clintons showing up as though they're coming out of their jumbo jet and it's a chariot out of the past for the nobility and people are starving in the streets.
[00:01:08.881 --> 00:01:11.524]  The peasants could hardly make ends meet.
[00:01:12.085 --> 00:01:22.689]  The people are unemployed, being thrown out of their homes, and putting on a lavish spectacle like this is really rubbing it in the face.
[00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:25.510]  To me, it wasn't an inauguration.
[00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.331]  It wasn't even a coronation.
[00:01:27.931 --> 00:01:30.252]  It was off with their heads 2.0.
[00:01:32.053 --> 00:01:33.994]  It was so insensitive.
[00:01:34.514 --> 00:01:36.375]  It was so out of character.
[00:01:36.755 --> 00:01:38.416]  It was so contrived.
[00:01:39.836 --> 00:01:42.517]  Even Beyonce was lip-syncing, right?
[00:01:42.698 --> 00:01:43.038]  That's right.
[00:01:43.078 --> 00:01:47.020]  And the band is pretending that they're playing music.
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.781]  The whole thing is a hoax.
[00:01:49.861 --> 00:01:50.602]  That's right, yeah.
[00:01:50.622 --> 00:01:51.802]  A hundred million dollars, wasn't it?
[00:01:51.822 --> 00:01:53.303]  Didn't they say it was a hundred million dollars?
[00:01:53.823 --> 00:01:56.725]  Whatever it was, you know, and of course... Astronomical.
[00:01:56.985 --> 00:01:58.365]  Where did the money come from?
[00:01:58.385 --> 00:01:59.146]  Right, right.
[00:01:59.566 --> 00:02:04.128]  Yeah, and at the same time, he's just... Everybody got their first paychecks of the year.
[00:02:04.148 --> 00:02:06.189]  Everybody that's working got their first paycheck of the year.
[00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:08.330]  The working poor see their taxes go up by 48%.
[00:02:09.998 --> 00:02:10.819]  On social security.
[00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:18.304]  You know, these are people making under $113,000 when he said he wasn't going to raise taxes on anybody unless they made over $250,000.
[00:02:18.444 --> 00:02:27.171]  I mean, he's taken these people who wanted class warfare, and he's given them class warfare, but they didn't realize what class he saw himself a part of.
[00:02:27.251 --> 00:02:29.493]  As you mentioned, he's the royal class.
[00:02:30.236 --> 00:02:31.777]  Yeah, well look at this scene.
[00:02:32.197 --> 00:02:39.201]  Look at this pedestal that they built for him and Michelle to dance on and making a big deal out of it.
[00:02:39.541 --> 00:02:42.283]  And just for the record, man, I watched it.
[00:02:42.303 --> 00:02:43.444]  The cat can't boogie.
[00:02:44.004 --> 00:02:44.384]  That's right.
[00:02:44.504 --> 00:02:45.945]  And you know something about that, don't you?
[00:02:46.465 --> 00:02:47.066]  Yeah, you know.
[00:02:48.186 --> 00:02:50.127]  You got that boogie in your bones, you know.
[00:02:50.368 --> 00:02:51.228]  You can't fake it.
[00:02:51.428 --> 00:02:51.728]  That's right.
[00:02:51.748 --> 00:02:53.409]  We got some good clips of you dancing with that.
[00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.573]  I wanted to talk to you about this thing that just recently happened with Germany repatriating gold.
[00:03:00.565 --> 00:03:01.446]  What do you think about that?
[00:03:01.586 --> 00:03:04.027]  I mean, Obama doesn't want to talk about what's going on financially.
[00:03:04.068 --> 00:03:12.513]  He'd rather have his coronation parties and his $10 million Hawaiian vacation and go after our guns because he doesn't really want to talk about what's going on financially.
[00:03:12.573 --> 00:03:15.115]  But do you see that as a pretty significant event?
[00:03:16.101 --> 00:03:16.922]  Well, absolutely.
[00:03:16.942 --> 00:03:19.864]  There's nothing mentioned about the unemployed in this whole speech.
[00:03:20.324 --> 00:03:25.367]  There's nothing really mentioned about, other than him saying, we're on the road to recovery.
[00:03:25.407 --> 00:03:27.549]  You know, that's just jive talk.
[00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:29.790]  So there's really nothing of substance.
[00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.734]  And when you look what happened, David, with what's going on in Germany, there's a lot to this story.
[00:03:36.375 --> 00:03:38.696]  The Germans, I mean, you know, check it out, man.
[00:03:38.976 --> 00:03:45.401]  I'm not really, you know, I'm not suffering from ADD, but it doesn't take a lot to remember.
[00:03:46.521 --> 00:03:52.842]  Weren't the English and the French and the Americans fighting the Germans in World War II?
[00:03:53.422 --> 00:03:59.903]  Why would the Germans give the French, the Americans, and the English all of their gold to hold?
[00:04:00.383 --> 00:04:01.844]  That's the story.
[00:04:02.284 --> 00:04:09.045]  So now what they're doing is because of a going-ons over there in Germany.
[00:04:09.065 --> 00:04:13.386]  As a matter of fact, I was in Munich recently when it just started to hit the fan.
[00:04:13.766 --> 00:04:15.146]  They want their gold back.
[00:04:15.766 --> 00:04:23.233]  And much of the gold is in the Federal Reserve in America, in the Bank of France, and in banks of England.
[00:04:23.653 --> 00:04:24.754]  So now they want it back.
[00:04:24.774 --> 00:04:25.595]  So here's the deal.
[00:04:26.869 --> 00:04:28.670]  They're not going to get all of it back until 2020.
[00:04:29.531 --> 00:04:33.473]  I mean, what's the, what, are they carrying this over one bar at a time?
[00:04:34.374 --> 00:04:34.834]  You know?
[00:04:35.334 --> 00:04:37.015]  I mean, what's the big deal here?
[00:04:37.035 --> 00:04:37.516]  Right.
[00:04:37.616 --> 00:04:47.742]  And then the other issue is, when you really look at the numbers, it's about a hundred and twenty-two billion euros worth of gold.
[00:04:48.223 --> 00:04:48.803]  Guess what?
[00:04:49.603 --> 00:04:51.284]  That's chump change.
[00:04:52.365 --> 00:05:05.120]  In a German economy and a global economy whose currencies are ostensibly have something behind them other than hot air.
[00:05:05.761 --> 00:05:10.326]  So the fact is I believe it is that number one the gold isn't there.
[00:05:11.388 --> 00:05:24.712]  Number two, if it is there, something's going on and they're not getting it back, because let's face it, I mean, what kind of imbecile would say it's going to take seven years to carry this stuff back and forth?
[00:05:24.732 --> 00:05:31.134]  I mean, what are they going to do, put it in Angela Merkel's pockets and bring it back every time she comes to Washington?
[00:05:31.154 --> 00:05:33.255]  I mean, who's making this baloney up?
[00:05:33.495 --> 00:05:34.355]  Right, right.
[00:05:34.675 --> 00:05:40.637]  So the other factor is, then you look at the report, here's something as a trend tracking tip.
[00:05:41.377 --> 00:05:54.181]  I've been doing this for over 30 years, and one of the things that you learn, David, is every time when the government comes out with information they're required to put out, they usually do it on a Friday afternoon.
[00:05:54.741 --> 00:06:02.224]  That's when all the people leave the bureaus, and Saturday is the least read news day of the week, by far.
[00:06:02.864 --> 00:06:04.825]  So what's the report that just came out?
[00:06:05.345 --> 00:06:08.726]  I'd like to read you this deadline, because most people don't know this.
[00:06:10.745 --> 00:06:11.926]  Goes back to the gold.
[00:06:12.226 --> 00:06:13.728]  And what a whole sham this thing is.
[00:06:14.168 --> 00:06:18.231]  Oh, and by the way, does this sound like a conspiracy theory?
[00:06:18.652 --> 00:06:19.693]  Figure this one out.
[00:06:20.273 --> 00:06:22.035]  How about those five lovely letters?
[00:06:22.115 --> 00:06:22.835]  LIBOR.
[00:06:23.376 --> 00:06:25.618]  Yeah, you remember the interest rate scandal.
[00:06:25.938 --> 00:06:28.320]  The banks were rigging the interest rates.
[00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:29.201]  Period.
[00:06:29.281 --> 00:06:29.921]  Paragraph.
[00:06:29.961 --> 00:06:30.662]  It's a fact.
[00:06:31.002 --> 00:06:34.245]  It's no conspiracy theory.
[00:06:34.605 --> 00:06:36.006]  And neither is this.
[00:06:38.072 --> 00:06:49.267]  Fed red-faced as notes reveal officials fail to grasp dangers of 2007 crises.
[00:06:49.728 --> 00:06:51.931]  This is from the Financial Times.
[00:06:52.351 --> 00:06:54.234]  This came out on the weekend.
[00:06:54.654 --> 00:06:57.737]  When very few people were following the news.
[00:06:58.277 --> 00:07:10.349]  In the toilet paper record, the New York Times, they buried it back in the news section with some white shoe boy language that would never tip off what really went on.
[00:07:10.629 --> 00:07:18.016]  And you had to read well into the story to see the sham, the stupidity, the ineptness,
[00:07:18.636 --> 00:07:22.617]  And the arrogance of the guys running the show.
[00:07:22.637 --> 00:07:43.243]  I'm pointing this out not to say that we were right and they were wrong, more so that the same jerks that didn't see it coming, the same imbeciles who wouldn't admit it when it was in front of them, are the same people that are now making the decisions.
[00:07:43.583 --> 00:07:47.544]  They continue to fail their way up to the top.
[00:07:48.064 --> 00:07:49.045]  Here's what it says.
[00:07:49.805 --> 00:07:51.486]  Top officials at the U.S.
[00:07:51.546 --> 00:08:06.876]  Federal Reserve took months to realize that the 2007 financial crisis would rock the world's largest economy, according to embarrassing meeting transcripts released yesterday.
[00:08:07.276 --> 00:08:08.777]  Now here's the other.
[00:08:09.237 --> 00:08:10.798]  And this one, you know, it's great.
[00:08:10.959 --> 00:08:16.382]  I love that America fights around the world to bring freedom and democracy.
[00:08:16.722 --> 00:08:18.023]  Freedom and democracy?
[00:08:18.043 --> 00:08:21.866]  They hold on to this stuff for five years.
[00:08:22.146 --> 00:08:23.567]  And you know why they hold on to it?
[00:08:23.927 --> 00:08:25.628]  So they can keep rigging the game.
[00:08:25.648 --> 00:08:26.329]  Right.
[00:08:26.349 --> 00:08:28.430]  So they can keep covering up their mistakes.
[00:08:28.931 --> 00:08:36.776]  And so because we the people are too damn stupid and too undeserving to have the information.
[00:08:37.296 --> 00:08:38.016]  Here it goes.
[00:08:38.777 --> 00:08:59.363]  The transcripts reveal that Fed policy makers viewed the crisis which erupted in August 2007 on the back of problems in the mortgage for subprime mortgage loans as good news because markets were pricing more risk.
[00:08:59.943 --> 00:09:02.044]  It goes on and on.
[00:09:02.384 --> 00:09:04.645]  They didn't have a clue.
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:25.543]  So now, you mentioned about this gold transfer, you said it's chump change, but I guess one of the things that got people's attention is this is the largest transfer, this will be the largest transfer that they've ever done, and the only countries prior to this that have repatriated anything are Iran, Venezuela, Libya, so this is the first time a Western
[00:09:26.344 --> 00:09:29.046]  Government has done it, and it's been because of public pressure, right?
[00:09:29.106 --> 00:09:31.167]  That people are pressuring them to get the gold back.
[00:09:31.187 --> 00:09:33.949]  So, I mean, what do you think that they're doing?
[00:09:34.009 --> 00:09:35.870]  Are they just bowing to public pressure?
[00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:38.191]  What's going on with the gold transfer?
[00:09:38.511 --> 00:09:40.112]  And how do you think that's going to affect gold prices?
[00:09:40.433 --> 00:09:44.215]  I mean, they've gone up, but is it, you know, is it going to send it up even higher, you think?
[00:09:44.895 --> 00:09:50.358]  To answer your questions, first of all, you pointed out the three countries prior to Germany.
[00:09:50.919 --> 00:09:53.940]  Venezuela, they write Chavez off as a maniac.
[00:09:55.962 --> 00:09:56.423]  Libya?
[00:09:56.543 --> 00:09:58.865]  What was that guy's name that they killed?
[00:09:58.885 --> 00:09:59.626]  Gaddafi, yeah.
[00:10:00.186 --> 00:10:02.008]  And who do they have sanctions against?
[00:10:02.028 --> 00:10:03.350]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:04.250]  Iran?
[00:10:04.571 --> 00:10:06.052]  Right, yeah, exactly.
[00:10:06.072 --> 00:10:06.593]  You get it?
[00:10:06.973 --> 00:10:07.254]  Right.
[00:10:07.654 --> 00:10:09.155]  Yeah, this is only a show.
[00:10:10.096 --> 00:10:12.839]  Because, here, read the news.
[00:10:13.956 --> 00:10:17.918]  They're debasing the currencies worldwide.
[00:10:19.059 --> 00:10:36.589]  As they debase the currencies, the only thing that's going to be worth anything are objects of value, whether they're diamonds, whether they're silver or platinum, nickel, silver, any gold, of course, that has value.
[00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:37.290]  Again,
[00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:39.392]  Look at the news.
[00:10:40.173 --> 00:10:52.946]  The new Prime Minister of Japan, Abe, first thing he's doing is he's pressuring the Bank of Japan to print more worthless money.
[00:10:53.667 --> 00:11:00.853]  Listen to the words of Mervyn King, the outgoing head of the Bank of England.
[00:11:01.314 --> 00:11:02.895]  There's a currency war.
[00:11:03.476 --> 00:11:04.897]  That's what he said.
[00:11:05.637 --> 00:11:07.579]  Abe said the same thing.
[00:11:08.039 --> 00:11:14.005]  So too has Guido Montaiga, the finance minister of Brazil.
[00:11:14.565 --> 00:11:17.708]  Pick up today's Financial Times.
[00:11:18.308 --> 00:11:26.135]  Read about how the Europeans are now unloading on the Japanese for the currency war.
[00:11:26.896 --> 00:11:31.139]  It's something we've seen this story before.
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:33.421]  It's the panic of 08.
[00:11:35.253 --> 00:11:40.197]  Depression, currency wars, trade wars, world war.
[00:11:40.597 --> 00:11:49.085]  The crash of 29, the Great Depression, currency wars, trade wars, world war.
[00:11:49.625 --> 00:11:52.607]  You listen, you go back, read history.
[00:11:53.388 --> 00:11:56.029]  You see what was going on in Japan.
[00:11:56.789 --> 00:12:03.772]  They flooded the market with cheap money under their Prime Minister and their finance guy.
[00:12:03.832 --> 00:12:11.756]  As a matter of fact, the army ended up assassinating him because he wouldn't keep dumping more money into the military.
[00:12:12.136 --> 00:12:18.900]  You go back to the 1930s, the trade wars were going on, they're heating up now.
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:33.868]  The reason it's a big deal about Germany repatriating their gold is because it shows that that is the only thing of value in this whole Ponzi scheme.
[00:12:34.148 --> 00:12:35.169]  Exactly, exactly.
[00:12:35.509 --> 00:12:38.871]  And we've seen it shoot up a little bit, but it's still well under $1,700 an ounce, I think, right?
[00:12:41.172 --> 00:12:47.694]  Again, I believe, and this is a little under, I believe the game is rigged.
[00:12:48.214 --> 00:12:55.836]  Every day, virtually, you pick up the papers, listen to the news, read about the insider trading scandals.
[00:12:56.336 --> 00:12:57.756]  I mentioned the LIBOR.
[00:12:58.216 --> 00:13:00.897]  It can't get bigger than rigging the LIBOR.
[00:13:01.337 --> 00:13:10.640]  You're talking about, you know, hundreds of trillions of dollars in loans, in mortgages, in fixing the interest rates.
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.821]  And it's not a conspiracy theory.
[00:13:14.241 --> 00:13:15.241]  It's a fact.
[00:13:15.561 --> 00:13:21.843]  They have the emails that went to Timothy Geithner when he was president of the New York Fed.
[00:13:22.084 --> 00:13:26.025]  They have the emails that went into the Bank of England.
[00:13:26.725 --> 00:13:27.605]  It's fact.
[00:13:28.105 --> 00:13:29.746]  So if they're rigging that,
[00:13:30.126 --> 00:13:32.088]  You think they're rigging gold?
[00:13:32.428 --> 00:13:41.715]  Because when gold prices skyrocket, people will be bailing out of these worthless currencies, and panic is on the way.
[00:13:42.476 --> 00:13:43.937]  Absolutely, and the Forbes...
[00:13:44.997 --> 00:13:48.980]  The article they quoted the Germans as saying they're concerned about a currency crisis.
[00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:54.645]  So you see this as part of a currency bubble that's about to hit, as well as you mentioned war, right?
[00:13:54.745 --> 00:13:56.206]  That's going to go hand in hand with that.
[00:13:56.606 --> 00:13:59.849]  That's one of your top trends coming up in Trends Journal, isn't it?
[00:14:00.169 --> 00:14:00.549]  Is war?
[00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:03.572]  Yeah, unfortunately, and it's going on.
[00:14:04.312 --> 00:14:08.916]  And you've got four steps to getting peace that you've got in there.
[00:14:08.936 --> 00:14:09.797]  Tell us a little bit about that.
[00:14:10.401 --> 00:14:11.482]  The Four Steps to Peace?
[00:14:11.662 --> 00:14:11.902]  Yeah.
[00:14:12.322 --> 00:14:14.084]  Well, the Four Steps to Peace is very easy.
[00:14:14.124 --> 00:14:15.945]  You hear these little chicken hawks over there.
[00:14:16.385 --> 00:14:19.608]  Cameron, Obama, Hollande, Hollande.
[00:14:19.648 --> 00:14:20.929]  How about Hollande-Dage?
[00:14:21.109 --> 00:14:22.370]  You see this guy, you know?
[00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:23.931]  That's about the only thing he could whip.
[00:14:24.932 --> 00:14:27.914]  So all of these people that want to take out somebody, I hear them.
[00:14:28.354 --> 00:14:29.655]  Assad has to go.
[00:14:29.675 --> 00:14:32.457]  You know, Ahmadinejad has to go.
[00:14:33.058 --> 00:14:33.398]  All right.
[00:14:33.998 --> 00:14:34.559]  Take him out.
[00:14:35.219 --> 00:14:37.361]  Look, if you call him out, you take him out.
[00:14:37.421 --> 00:14:38.261]  You pick a fight.
[00:14:39.324 --> 00:14:40.064]  Fight the fight.
[00:14:40.485 --> 00:14:42.826]  I watched Alex Jones on Piers Morgan.
[00:14:42.866 --> 00:14:49.108]  He said to him, I'll put on a robe, we'll go a couple of rounds, mine will be an American flag, you put the Union Jack on.
[00:14:49.628 --> 00:14:52.770]  Alex didn't say, hey Salenti, go fight my fight for me.
[00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:59.353]  So why these guys who have these big mouths and no cojones
[00:15:00.473 --> 00:15:04.196]  Start fights and then send other people to go do their dirty work.
[00:15:04.636 --> 00:15:07.218]  So let's go back to the good old days.
[00:15:07.878 --> 00:15:09.279]  Alexander the Great.
[00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:10.901]  William the Conqueror.
[00:15:11.801 --> 00:15:13.763]  Hey, how about George Washington?
[00:15:13.783 --> 00:15:14.683]  Napoleon?
[00:15:15.304 --> 00:15:17.906]  The guys started the fight, they fought the fight.
[00:15:18.246 --> 00:15:22.649]  So what I suggest, rule number one, Gerald Slanty's first rule of war.
[00:15:23.029 --> 00:15:29.134]  What we do is we rent out the Arena di Verona, the splendidly restored Roman amphitheater.
[00:15:29.634 --> 00:15:32.957]  And we put on a pay-per-view, world leader takedown.
[00:15:33.257 --> 00:15:34.178]  Fight to the finish.
[00:15:34.699 --> 00:15:35.359]  I'd pay to see that.
[00:15:35.379 --> 00:15:36.000]  I'm serious.
[00:15:36.853 --> 00:15:37.854]  They did it before!
[00:15:38.354 --> 00:15:40.156]  Keep us out of your psycho trip!
[00:15:40.996 --> 00:15:41.977]  Rule number two.
[00:15:42.918 --> 00:15:45.480]  If you're for the war, you fight the war.
[00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:51.664]  And if you're too infirm, or for another reason you can't fight the war, you pay for the war.
[00:15:52.345 --> 00:15:53.206]  You want the war?
[00:15:53.526 --> 00:15:57.309]  You send your kids, send your wife, send yourself, send your money.
[00:15:57.689 --> 00:15:59.470]  Keep me out of your psycho trip.
[00:15:59.931 --> 00:16:00.931]  Rule number three.
[00:16:03.393 --> 00:16:04.234]  The golden rule.
[00:16:05.285 --> 00:16:07.306]  Look what just happened over there in Mali.
[00:16:08.366 --> 00:16:11.407]  All of a sudden, the French decide they're going to invade.
[00:16:12.467 --> 00:16:17.048]  The people in Mali said, hey, you invaded, there's gonna be payback.
[00:16:17.408 --> 00:16:22.109]  Read the Christian Science Monitor the day after France struck.
[00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:24.030]  Those were the words.
[00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:26.511]  There's going to be payback.
[00:16:27.191 --> 00:16:28.051]  There was payback.
[00:16:28.511 --> 00:16:31.052]  And as we say in the Bronx, payback's a bitch.
[00:16:32.012 --> 00:16:35.395]  So now they paid back with the Algerian crisis.
[00:16:35.435 --> 00:16:35.916]  They said it.
[00:16:36.496 --> 00:16:37.497]  This is payback.
[00:16:38.077 --> 00:16:39.379]  So what do they say now?
[00:16:40.119 --> 00:16:41.460]  Oh, these terrorists!
[00:16:41.821 --> 00:16:43.362]  These crazy people!
[00:16:43.722 --> 00:16:43.942]  No.
[00:16:44.343 --> 00:16:45.384]  The golden rule.
[00:16:45.804 --> 00:16:48.727]  Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.
[00:16:49.067 --> 00:16:50.368]  Don't call them names.
[00:16:50.768 --> 00:16:51.969]  Call it getting even.
[00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:53.411]  Rule number four.
[00:16:54.847 --> 00:16:57.988]  Rule number four is, let the people vote.
[00:16:58.428 --> 00:16:59.809]  You wanna go to war?
[00:17:00.409 --> 00:17:04.311]  I remember that wonderful humanitarian mission by Obama.
[00:17:04.811 --> 00:17:11.053]  Cat hits the stage, saying we're gonna launch a humanitarian mission, and what does he do?
[00:17:11.133 --> 00:17:11.394]  Boop!
[00:17:11.434 --> 00:17:15.455]  He's on the plane to Rio with his wife, his mother-in-law, and his kids.
[00:17:16.135 --> 00:17:17.316]  I saw it with Bush.
[00:17:18.479 --> 00:17:38.295]  We gotta take out Saddam Hussein, he has weapons of mass destruction, and a gang of 535, 535 flunkies, politicians, congressmen, senators, that are only in power because they get money from special interests and serve the power.
[00:17:39.156 --> 00:17:45.683]  Powerful voting for us to decide whether you, me, or anybody else should go to war.
[00:17:46.084 --> 00:17:50.368]  The burden of the war falls on the people's shoulders.
[00:17:50.829 --> 00:17:54.393]  If you want to go to war, let the people vote.
[00:17:54.873 --> 00:18:00.834]  I don't need somebody to vote for me to tell me what I should do.
[00:18:01.234 --> 00:18:04.375]  These are not representatives of me.
[00:18:04.775 --> 00:18:10.956]  They only represent the people with the most power, the most money, and the most interests.
[00:18:11.416 --> 00:18:13.276]  Those are my four rules of peace.
[00:18:13.736 --> 00:18:14.116]  That's right.
[00:18:14.136 --> 00:18:15.877]  They've even moved away from the 535.
[00:18:16.037 --> 00:18:22.738]  They've moved back to Usa Panetta, telling Jeff Sessions, we don't need your authority to go to war.
[00:18:23.365 --> 00:18:34.339]  We're just going to, we might tell you what we're going to do, but we're going to talk to the United Nations, we're going to talk to NATO, and then we're going to make that decision, and we might inform Congress what we're going to do.
[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:37.604]  I mean, they've moved us dramatically in the other direction, haven't they?
[00:18:38.188 --> 00:18:39.869]  Yeah, and they're a bunch of losers.
[00:18:39.929 --> 00:18:40.949]  That's the other thing.
[00:18:41.309 --> 00:18:43.610]  Hey, they did a great job in Vietnam, didn't they?
[00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:43.951]  Oh, yeah.
[00:18:43.971 --> 00:18:50.254]  Hey, for firepower, we only killed 3 million and destroyed the country with Agent Orange.
[00:18:50.574 --> 00:19:01.439]  If only you would have let us lose more and we only killed 60,000 of our troops, wounded a couple of hundred thousand more and a couple of hundred thousand more for life.
[00:19:01.839 --> 00:19:02.919]  I got a better one.
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:05.580]  Let's go into Afghanistan.
[00:19:05.881 --> 00:19:06.301]  Yeah.
[00:19:06.781 --> 00:19:09.123]  Yeah, Alexander the Great couldn't pull it off.
[00:19:09.484 --> 00:19:10.745]  The English couldn't do it.
[00:19:11.025 --> 00:19:12.347]  The Russians couldn't do it.
[00:19:12.727 --> 00:19:13.548]  But we'll do it.
[00:19:13.708 --> 00:19:15.089]  Hey, remember that guy?
[00:19:15.309 --> 00:19:16.270]  What was his name?
[00:19:16.731 --> 00:19:18.713]  Stanley McChrystal Meth?
[00:19:19.073 --> 00:19:22.636]  Now he's teaching leadership at Yale or something?
[00:19:22.697 --> 00:19:24.358]  Can you imagine what a BS course?
[00:19:24.378 --> 00:19:28.062]  Imagine spending money to hear this guy shoot his mouth off leadership.
[00:19:28.382 --> 00:19:30.223]  Remember his impressive progress?
[00:19:30.643 --> 00:19:32.143]  Remember that other guy, Petraeus?
[00:19:32.163 --> 00:19:32.844]  You remember him?
[00:19:33.104 --> 00:19:34.544]  The guy that got caught with some chick?
[00:19:34.964 --> 00:19:35.585]  You don't remember him?
[00:19:35.605 --> 00:19:36.865]  He was a general over there?
[00:19:36.985 --> 00:19:39.366]  With the impressive progress in Afghanistan?
[00:19:39.746 --> 00:19:40.086]  Oh, oh!
[00:19:40.446 --> 00:19:41.747]  How about Iraq?
[00:19:42.127 --> 00:19:44.848]  Yeah, weapons of mass destruction, ties to Al-Qaeda.
[00:19:45.268 --> 00:19:46.909]  Look at the beauty of that one.
[00:19:47.249 --> 00:19:49.270]  Trillion dollars down the drain.
[00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:51.871]  Five thousand of our people dead.
[00:19:52.272 --> 00:19:55.493]  Suicide rates among the troops going off the charts.
[00:19:55.993 --> 00:19:56.874]  Oh, oh, oh.
[00:19:57.314 --> 00:19:57.714]  One more.
[00:19:57.754 --> 00:19:59.815]  We only killed a million people.
[00:20:00.876 --> 00:20:03.257]  So they're losers.
[00:20:03.557 --> 00:20:05.018]  Listen to this loser talk.
[00:20:06.172 --> 00:20:11.053]  This is Cameron, that little weenie over there, that little Eton Oxford boy.
[00:20:11.313 --> 00:20:12.954]  This guy, you know what he does?
[00:20:13.614 --> 00:20:15.734]  He plays against a tennis machine.
[00:20:16.054 --> 00:20:17.415]  That's his biggest fight.
[00:20:17.435 --> 00:20:19.195]  The UK Prime Minister, right.
[00:20:19.615 --> 00:20:19.835]  Yeah.
[00:20:20.396 --> 00:20:21.756]  This is a global threat.
[00:20:22.116 --> 00:20:25.897]  It will require, talking about Mali, a global response.
[00:20:26.417 --> 00:20:32.299]  It will require a response that is about years, even decades, rather than months.
[00:20:32.419 --> 00:20:33.419]  Now here's the best part.
[00:20:33.979 --> 00:20:49.151]  Quote, it requires a response that is patient and painstaking, that is tough but also intelligent, but above all has an absolutely iron resolve and that
[00:20:50.385 --> 00:20:54.666]  Is what we will deliver over these coming years.
[00:20:55.007 --> 00:20:57.267]  I love that English limey lingo!
[00:20:57.727 --> 00:20:58.648]  Iron resolve!
[00:20:58.988 --> 00:21:01.569]  I got a piece of iron resolve for ya!
[00:21:01.889 --> 00:21:03.089]  Painstaking!
[00:21:03.409 --> 00:21:04.330]  Intelligent!
[00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:06.430]  They're not talking about you!
[00:21:07.671 --> 00:21:10.672]  How could that little country be a global threat?
[00:21:10.812 --> 00:21:16.594]  Most people can't even find it on the map, just like they couldn't find the Gulf of Tonkin on the map when they used that as a tool.
[00:21:16.634 --> 00:21:17.274]  I think one of the most
[00:21:17.975 --> 00:21:21.197]  One of the most powerful movies I've seen lately was The Fog of War.
[00:21:21.237 --> 00:21:22.338]  I don't know if you saw that or not.
[00:21:22.478 --> 00:21:26.361]  It was an extended interview with McNamara.
[00:21:26.741 --> 00:21:30.103]  And he was talking about how Gulf of Tonkin was a false flag event.
[00:21:30.643 --> 00:21:35.226]  And then he talked about how years and years after the war, he went back and met with Vietnamese leaders.
[00:21:36.067 --> 00:21:43.412]  And he said, the North Vietnamese leader got up and said, why did you do what you did?
[00:21:44.361 --> 00:21:47.022]  And McNamara said, it was because of the domino theory.
[00:21:47.403 --> 00:21:48.823]  And the guy was furious.
[00:21:49.023 --> 00:21:50.824]  Pounded the table and he said, you fool.
[00:21:51.145 --> 00:21:51.985]  You killed all these people.
[00:21:52.025 --> 00:21:54.606]  He said, there was no domino theory.
[00:21:54.646 --> 00:21:56.507]  He says, don't you know anything about history?
[00:21:57.028 --> 00:22:02.110]  For a thousand years we fought the Chinese for our independence and we fought you because you were there for our independence.
[00:22:02.811 --> 00:22:05.172]  And McNamara told this story after the fact.
[00:22:05.692 --> 00:22:08.033]  So yeah, Mali is another one of these deals.
[00:22:09.827 --> 00:22:10.768]  Yeah, check this one out.
[00:22:10.808 --> 00:22:11.908]  This is a great one, too.
[00:22:12.389 --> 00:22:31.780]  Matter of fact, I wrote about McNamara's lies in my book, Trends 2000, back in 1996, about how he knew that the war was a losing war, and because the psychopath, like the rest of them out there, he should have been hung for knowing this, and prosecuting it.
[00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:33.100]  He should have been prosecuted.
[00:22:33.301 --> 00:22:35.242]  Here's another beautiful quote about Marley.
[00:22:35.262 --> 00:22:38.584]  I mean, you gotta, this stuff is, you can't believe this stuff.
[00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:46.826]  Angela Merkel stated Wednesday that, quote, terrorism in Mali was a threat to Europe and to Germany.
[00:22:47.147 --> 00:22:49.649]  Oh yeah, then Mali is on the loose, man!
[00:22:49.669 --> 00:22:52.411]  They're gonna get on a camel before you know it!
[00:22:52.731 --> 00:22:53.552]  You know, woof!
[00:22:53.892 --> 00:22:55.494]  They're gonna be in Germany, yeah.
[00:22:55.854 --> 00:22:59.737]  Going right down, you know, they'll be right in the heart of Berlin before you know it.
[00:23:00.791 --> 00:23:16.345]  Well, all these wars are going to keep the public's eye off of the currency crisis, keep their eye off what the central banks are doing, keep their eye off all this economic meltdown, which is what Obama's doing here at home with the attack on the Second Amendment, attack on gun owners.
[00:23:16.385 --> 00:23:19.187]  He doesn't want to do anything to address any fiscal things.
[00:23:19.227 --> 00:23:23.531]  Just like the first term, he completely avoided it and focused on his health care agenda.
[00:23:23.591 --> 00:23:25.613]  Now he's got to have some other boogeyman to slay.
[00:23:26.425 --> 00:23:27.185]  Well, you nailed it.
[00:23:27.425 --> 00:23:28.786]  You read his speech yesterday.
[00:23:29.326 --> 00:23:30.826]  What does he say right in the beginning?
[00:23:31.546 --> 00:23:32.546]  He says it right there.
[00:23:32.566 --> 00:23:38.148]  Let me pull it up here a second.
[00:23:38.848 --> 00:23:44.929]  He said to the effect that the United States was going to be doing its policing around the world.
[00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:47.450]  And that's exactly what they're doing.
[00:23:49.142 --> 00:23:54.943]  America will remain the anchor of strong alliances in every corner of the globe!
[00:23:55.403 --> 00:23:57.884]  Oh, before that he was talking about the Founding Fathers.
[00:23:58.104 --> 00:23:59.784]  Yeah, right up their alley, you know?
[00:24:00.444 --> 00:24:08.586]  Yeah, and we will renew those institutions that extend our capacity to manage crises abroad.
[00:24:08.906 --> 00:24:10.286]  Manage crises abroad?
[00:24:10.546 --> 00:24:12.446]  How about managing the one over here?
[00:24:12.726 --> 00:24:15.887]  Or maybe you're talking about the broad potatoes he was talking about!
[00:24:16.227 --> 00:24:18.468]  Because I don't know what abroad you're talking about.
[00:24:18.829 --> 00:24:20.410]  Because you can't manage anything.
[00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:22.931]  You started a losing war in Libya.
[00:24:23.231 --> 00:24:24.952]  There's a civil war there now.
[00:24:25.273 --> 00:24:27.474]  They're destabilizing Syria.
[00:24:27.854 --> 00:24:29.455]  Now they're going into Mali.
[00:24:29.735 --> 00:24:32.717]  Oh, oh, that couldn't be because of AFRICOM.
[00:24:33.037 --> 00:24:33.878]  You know that one.
[00:24:34.178 --> 00:24:47.622]  The United States sending troops into 35 countries in North Africa, throughout Africa, couldn't because the Chinese are ripping off all the minerals and resources and they want their share, could it?
[00:24:47.863 --> 00:24:48.603]  Right, right.
[00:24:48.683 --> 00:24:57.566]  So when you read the language of Obama's inauguration speech, it's right here in black and white
[00:24:58.306 --> 00:25:07.669]  And he says that for no one has a greater stake in a peaceful world than the most powerful nation.
[00:25:07.969 --> 00:25:09.109]  Colonialism!
[00:25:09.169 --> 00:25:10.349]  Imperialism!
[00:25:10.789 --> 00:25:12.390]  Stay out of their business!
[00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:13.210]  Absolutely.
[00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:15.631]  And I think it's pretty clear too.
[00:25:15.971 --> 00:25:17.991]  He didn't talk about solving a crisis.
[00:25:18.331 --> 00:25:19.492]  He talked about managing it.
[00:25:20.072 --> 00:25:21.752]  They don't want to solve it.
[00:25:21.792 --> 00:25:22.713]  They want to keep it going.
[00:25:22.853 --> 00:25:23.873]  They want to keep it perpetual.
[00:25:24.887 --> 00:25:27.048]  Again, you nailed it.
[00:25:27.328 --> 00:25:31.050]  They're doing the same thing with this guy Hollande over there in France.
[00:25:31.571 --> 00:25:35.212]  They're getting the people's minds off the economic problems.
[00:25:35.753 --> 00:25:37.614]  They're doing the same thing in the UK.
[00:25:38.014 --> 00:25:42.056]  You read the data coming out of Germany, it's going down over there as well.
[00:25:42.376 --> 00:25:45.138]  It goes back to the repatriation of the gold.
[00:25:45.478 --> 00:25:51.121]  The only reason that these economies are standing up to any levels at all
[00:25:51.821 --> 00:25:55.745]  Is because of the low record low interest rates.
[00:25:56.386 --> 00:26:04.294]  I just got a commercial loan to buy one of the most historic buildings in Colonial Kingston at 3.25% and they covered closing costs.
[00:26:09.219 --> 00:26:11.980]  And it's locked in for 20 years.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.161]  Yeah.
[00:26:13.201 --> 00:26:22.185]  The only reason these economies are turning around is because they're flooding the markets with cheap dough.
[00:26:22.545 --> 00:26:34.611]  And at some point, these interest rates are going to go back up, the bond markets are going to explode, and the economy is going to crash much worse than it did before.
[00:26:34.911 --> 00:26:36.772]  And if you don't believe me,
[00:26:38.803 --> 00:26:41.714]  Listen to the Federal Reserve cats, man!
[00:26:41.734 --> 00:26:42.437]  Right.
[00:26:42.918 --> 00:26:43.139]  Right.
[00:26:43.159 --> 00:26:43.501]  They who?
[00:26:44.429 --> 00:26:44.889]  Right, yeah.
[00:26:44.929 --> 00:27:00.679]  While the stock market is doing well, and while interest rates are low, with all these new regulations of the Obamacare, the people who are the working poor, they're going to have to, you know, they're getting laid off, they're getting their hours reduced to under 30, because anything over 30 is now full-time jobs.
[00:27:00.699 --> 00:27:07.804]  So a lot of these people who are trying to make ends meet at the very bottom are going to have to juggle two part-time jobs, try to get their schedules worked out, do that sort of thing.
[00:27:07.824 --> 00:27:10.005]  They're seeing their social security taxes going up.
[00:27:10.638 --> 00:27:15.607]  But a lot of these people are the same people who voted for Obama because they thought he was going to punish the rich.
[00:27:16.548 --> 00:27:17.129]  Oh, I know.
[00:27:17.290 --> 00:27:19.273]  I mean, you read the headline of today's paper.
[00:27:19.293 --> 00:27:20.335]  I don't have it in front of me.
[00:27:20.375 --> 00:27:21.096]  The New York Times.
[00:27:21.136 --> 00:27:21.737]  Maybe this is it.
[00:27:21.758 --> 00:27:22.158]  Let me see.
[00:27:23.672 --> 00:27:33.298]  No, they had something along the headline of how Obama's talk inauguration was a liberal message.
[00:27:34.119 --> 00:27:35.640]  I'm saying to myself, a liberal message?
[00:27:36.961 --> 00:27:39.543]  They just killed 13 people in Yemen with a drone.
[00:27:39.563 --> 00:27:40.503]  Right, right.
[00:27:40.523 --> 00:27:43.025]  You know, we have wireless wiretapping.
[00:27:43.385 --> 00:27:45.608]  The National Defense Authorization Act.
[00:27:45.969 --> 00:27:52.317]  What he just signed another one recently that allows them to spy on us forever for no reason at all.
[00:27:52.798 --> 00:27:53.399]  Liberal?
[00:27:53.719 --> 00:27:56.543]  And store it in the Utah data center that they're going to open up this year.
[00:27:56.603 --> 00:27:57.825]  That giant center in Utah.
[00:27:57.845 --> 00:28:00.889]  They're going to store everything there that they're spying on us illegally on.
[00:28:01.434 --> 00:28:03.237]  Yeah, was that the NSA one?
[00:28:03.497 --> 00:28:04.839]  Yeah, the one in Utah.
[00:28:04.879 --> 00:28:06.462]  It's a multi-billion dollar center.
[00:28:06.502 --> 00:28:09.807]  It's got, actually, it's got yodabytes of storage.
[00:28:09.847 --> 00:28:10.608]  I had to look that up.
[00:28:10.968 --> 00:28:13.192]  That's a trillion terabytes.
[00:28:13.392 --> 00:28:13.933]  A yodabyte.
[00:28:13.953 --> 00:28:16.597]  I had to come up with a new suffix for that.
[00:28:17.096 --> 00:28:19.358]  Yes, so you're 100% correct, David.
[00:28:19.918 --> 00:28:21.299]  The liberals lie.
[00:28:21.659 --> 00:28:30.666]  You show them one after another how Obama is everything that they say they hate, and they keep supporting them.
[00:28:31.026 --> 00:28:32.007]  And they're not alone.
[00:28:32.527 --> 00:28:35.269]  You look at the polling data that came out recently.
[00:28:35.569 --> 00:28:37.391]  What is Congress's approval rating?
[00:28:37.431 --> 00:28:37.611]  Like 9%?
[00:28:37.731 --> 00:28:38.051]  Right.
[00:28:39.452 --> 00:28:46.457]  And yet, what, 94% of the incumbents got re-elected, and well over 50% of the people turned out to vote.
[00:28:47.077 --> 00:28:49.959]  So the people are also getting what they deserve.
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:52.361]  And then there's the whole other group of people.
[00:28:52.801 --> 00:28:57.264]  You hit them, and everybody, especially Alex Jones listeners, know this.
[00:28:58.445 --> 00:29:04.469]  You start talking to friends and family about the facts, what's going on, and I don't want to hear that.
[00:29:05.669 --> 00:29:06.650]  I don't want to hear that.
[00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:07.990]  You're too negative.
[00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:09.051]  You're a gloom and doomer.
[00:29:09.371 --> 00:29:09.731]  That's right.
[00:29:10.211 --> 00:29:11.031]  That upsets me.
[00:29:11.072 --> 00:29:13.212]  If it upsets me, I don't want to hear about it.
[00:29:14.153 --> 00:29:15.834]  So that's what's going on as well.
[00:29:16.314 --> 00:29:20.796]  Yeah, this weekend we were at a rally here at the state capitol for the second amendment.
[00:29:21.496 --> 00:29:24.077]  And that's what I was told by somebody who just woke up.
[00:29:24.117 --> 00:29:25.698]  He said, hey, it was really scary.
[00:29:26.698 --> 00:29:29.840]  And my first reaction is to run away from this bad news.
[00:29:30.569 --> 00:29:32.871]  But it doesn't make the bad news go away if you run away from it.
[00:29:33.252 --> 00:29:33.432]  Right?
[00:29:33.472 --> 00:29:37.296]  You've got to face it and try to find some way that you're going to survive through it.
[00:29:37.716 --> 00:29:39.078]  Some way to try to rectify it.
[00:29:40.239 --> 00:29:41.039]  But you're right.
[00:29:41.079 --> 00:29:42.721]  That's what people say.
[00:29:43.202 --> 00:29:45.184]  They don't want to hear the bad news.
[00:29:45.224 --> 00:29:48.527]  They reject it because it's not a happy scenario.
[00:29:48.827 --> 00:29:51.330]  And they're getting offered happy scenarios on television all the time.
[00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:53.512]  They want to believe in a happy ever after.
[00:29:54.505 --> 00:30:02.071]  Yeah, and the other part of it is, as well, is like you said, you know, to wake up to it and realize that you believed in a lie all your life.
[00:30:02.091 --> 00:30:06.855]  You know, it's like believing in a religion and all of a sudden you don't believe in it anymore.
[00:30:07.255 --> 00:30:08.136]  And that's what these are.
[00:30:08.156 --> 00:30:09.477]  These are political religions.
[00:30:09.557 --> 00:30:09.917]  That's right.
[00:30:10.197 --> 00:30:10.838]  I don't see it.
[00:30:10.878 --> 00:30:13.742]  You know, I mean, I've gotten, you know, I've almost gotten in a fight with a guy one time.
[00:30:13.782 --> 00:30:15.605]  I said something that he didn't like.
[00:30:15.625 --> 00:30:17.347]  Don't you talk about my president like that.
[00:30:17.367 --> 00:30:19.190]  And I, you know, I went off on this guy.
[00:30:19.210 --> 00:30:20.031]  Who are you talking to?
[00:30:20.051 --> 00:30:21.874]  I'll say whatever I damn well please.
[00:30:22.114 --> 00:30:22.354]  Right.
[00:30:22.374 --> 00:30:22.595]  Absolutely.
[00:30:22.615 --> 00:30:25.419]  But, you know, Pete, this is a religion and I'm a political atheist.
[00:30:25.859 --> 00:30:32.823]  Because I don't believe in political religions, and I certainly would not bow to a political god, you know, that's not down... that's beneath me.
[00:30:33.243 --> 00:30:52.313]  But the other point of this is, and as we go through the top trends of 2013 that we have in the New Trends Journal, which by the way is 60 pages, advertising-free, of information about what's going on in the world, like covered nowhere else,
[00:30:52.833 --> 00:30:53.033]  Yeah.
[00:30:53.133 --> 00:30:56.796]  And money back guarantees you could find better or you don't like it.
[00:30:57.157 --> 00:31:00.700]  And the other issue is preparing you for the world tomorrow.
[00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:03.362]  There's another positive trend in there.
[00:31:04.042 --> 00:31:05.684]  And that is the Great Awakening 2.0.
[00:31:06.444 --> 00:31:11.108]  It was a great awakening in America prior to the American Revolution.
[00:31:12.049 --> 00:31:14.130]  At first it was a religious revival.
[00:31:14.610 --> 00:31:29.295]  People realizing, the people that believed in salvation, they finally understood that if you're going to achieve salvation, it's not because you're following the dictates of a church or a hierarchy, it's about how you live your life.
[00:31:29.315 --> 00:31:34.716]  And it's not about the religion that you live, it's about how you live.
[00:31:35.116 --> 00:31:36.457]  That was the first part of it.
[00:31:37.403 --> 00:31:44.268]  The second part of the Great Awakening was to the awakening that there is no nobility out there.
[00:31:44.788 --> 00:31:50.332]  That King George III is just another average or below average guy.
[00:31:50.352 --> 00:32:03.642]  And when you read the letters going back and forth between Jefferson or Franklin and the people going overseas talking about the royalty, what a disgrace these people were!
[00:32:04.322 --> 00:32:05.964]  The people woke up to that.
[00:32:06.624 --> 00:32:09.466]  Well, David, we have the same kind of nobility.
[00:32:09.886 --> 00:32:20.974]  Again, look at that shot of the Clintons walking out of their jumbo jet with all of the gold and red trappings around them.
[00:32:21.214 --> 00:32:21.454]  Absolutely.
[00:32:21.474 --> 00:32:23.376]  And all the paparazzi.
[00:32:24.196 --> 00:32:28.137]  And look at all of this grandeur for the coronation.
[00:32:28.697 --> 00:32:30.078]  The people are waking up.
[00:32:30.658 --> 00:32:32.359]  These are not nobility.
[00:32:32.779 --> 00:32:41.781]  Matter of fact, they're the same people you couldn't stand in high school and college that wanted to be class president and head of the student council.
[00:32:42.081 --> 00:32:49.944]  The suck ups, the brown noses, the glad handers, the insincere and the overly ambitious.
[00:32:50.484 --> 00:32:53.745]  So we're seeing the beginning of a great awakening.
[00:32:54.786 --> 00:32:58.270]  Yeah, yeah, it was at the early days of our Republic.
[00:32:58.831 --> 00:33:02.576]  Ambition was considered to be a severe character flaw when it came to politicians.
[00:33:02.616 --> 00:33:04.318]  Today it seems to be a prerequisite, isn't it?
[00:33:05.139 --> 00:33:05.960]  They brag about it.
[00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:07.081]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[00:33:07.402 --> 00:33:07.722]  Absolutely.
[00:33:07.962 --> 00:33:12.208]  Are there any other trends that you see besides war and a Great Awakening?
[00:33:13.410 --> 00:33:15.333]  Yeah, there are some very positive ones.
[00:33:15.633 --> 00:33:20.760]  Again, I look at things the way they are, not the way I want them to be as a political atheist.
[00:33:21.161 --> 00:33:24.245]  You look at how young people, you go back to Christmas sales.
[00:33:25.547 --> 00:33:27.670]  Tablets are outselling toys for kids.
[00:33:28.717 --> 00:33:32.480]  Little kids are growing up now and they're infants and they're playing with this stuff, right?
[00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:35.262]  Their brains are being wired differently.
[00:33:35.282 --> 00:33:38.104]  You know, figuratively of course.
[00:33:38.484 --> 00:33:45.510]  I actually saw a, let me just interject here, I actually saw a YouTube video where they handed a little two-year-old kid a book.
[00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:51.174]  And the two-year-old kid is trying to do these pitch and zoom gestures, you know, from the iPad on the book.
[00:33:51.863 --> 00:33:55.447]  It was kind of funny, but you're talking about people having their brains wired differently.
[00:33:55.487 --> 00:34:02.275]  That just shows, you know, this is obviously the first time this young child had their hands on a book.
[00:34:02.805 --> 00:34:06.026]  Yeah, they've grown up totally in this virtual world.
[00:34:06.947 --> 00:34:07.667]  Exactly!
[00:34:07.787 --> 00:34:11.688]  So now, the education system has to adjust to it.
[00:34:12.349 --> 00:34:15.150]  Our education system is a total failure.
[00:34:15.830 --> 00:34:22.232]  I say that with true confidence, in the sense that by their deeds you shall know them.
[00:34:22.793 --> 00:34:31.636]  We spend more on education than virtually any other nation in the OECD, Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development System.
[00:34:32.512 --> 00:34:35.373]  Yet, look at the failure of this nation.
[00:34:36.113 --> 00:34:39.434]  If our education system worked, do you think we'd be in the trouble we're in?
[00:34:40.034 --> 00:34:43.335]  So the system is designed for the industrial age.
[00:34:43.975 --> 00:34:49.037]  A new system is being born, and it hasn't been developed yet.
[00:34:49.197 --> 00:34:56.359]  I'm mentioning this, and we talk more about it in the Trends Journal, because the people that are looking for opportunities in the future,
[00:34:57.119 --> 00:35:04.165]  To find professions and investment opportunities, start looking in new millennium education.
[00:35:04.625 --> 00:35:07.908]  Because a whole new learning system is going to take place.
[00:35:08.288 --> 00:35:10.250]  This thing is going to change radically.
[00:35:10.690 --> 00:35:16.194]  In 50 years, our education system will look nothing like it is today.
[00:35:16.655 --> 00:35:24.421]  To the extent that when you go back to the beginning of the Industrial Age, and you had all of these people in factories,
[00:35:24.841 --> 00:35:27.304]  Then they got started getting replaced by machines.
[00:35:27.684 --> 00:35:30.067]  Then they got started replaced by robots.
[00:35:30.902 --> 00:35:33.423]  The same thing is going to happen with teachers.
[00:35:34.283 --> 00:35:36.403]  You're not going to need all these teachers.
[00:35:36.824 --> 00:35:39.244]  The whole system is going to change.
[00:35:39.704 --> 00:35:41.665]  So this is a huge trend.
[00:35:42.065 --> 00:35:51.768]  We're one of the few people, I don't know of anyone, actually, I wrote about Interactive U, again, back in Trends 2000, in 1996.
[00:35:52.708 --> 00:35:55.109]  When, you know, the computer age really didn't begin until around 92, 94.
[00:35:57.102 --> 00:35:58.964]  And it really hasn't gotten there yet.
[00:35:59.325 --> 00:36:02.849]  Trends are born, they grow, they mature, reach old age and die.
[00:36:03.289 --> 00:36:07.334]  This trend has just been born for new millennium education.
[00:36:07.714 --> 00:36:09.597]  Another big trend that we write about.
[00:36:11.138 --> 00:36:14.260]  You know, I coined the term in 93, clean foods.
[00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:22.105]  These are foods that weren't, that were, that not were only organic and chemical free, but brought to market in the best of sanitary conditions.
[00:36:22.205 --> 00:36:22.405]  Right.
[00:36:22.665 --> 00:36:26.348]  Now we're looking at a big trend, it's going to be safe foods.
[00:36:27.028 --> 00:36:30.010]  Because the whole game has changed.
[00:36:31.501 --> 00:36:34.184]  Look at the drought conditions going on in the states.
[00:36:34.244 --> 00:36:35.525]  It's not only the states.
[00:36:35.805 --> 00:36:38.147]  What they can't bring barges down the Mississippi.
[00:36:38.167 --> 00:36:41.610]  They're having problems because the water table is so low.
[00:36:42.111 --> 00:36:45.513]  There's going to be a shortage of safe foods.
[00:36:46.074 --> 00:36:48.416]  Foods that are not genetically modified.
[00:36:49.056 --> 00:36:52.399]  Foods that aren't pesticide laden and chemically treated.
[00:36:53.829 --> 00:36:56.891]  Micro-farms are going to grow and expand.
[00:36:57.411 --> 00:37:07.096]  City centers growing more foods, particularly in these dilapidated downtown areas, are going to be reborn with a new homesteading.
[00:37:07.496 --> 00:37:09.197]  So there are a lot of opportunities.
[00:37:09.257 --> 00:37:10.638]  Kind of a locavore movement, right?
[00:37:10.778 --> 00:37:12.059]  Kind of a locavore movement.
[00:37:12.159 --> 00:37:15.420]  Locally produced, locally consumed food, right?
[00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:16.141]  Exactly.
[00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:18.182]  You know, you're all what you eat.
[00:37:18.342 --> 00:37:22.748]  I mean, let's face it, you eat a lot of crap, drink a lot of crap, you're gonna look like crap.
[00:37:23.289 --> 00:37:24.951]  You know, it's the same thing.
[00:37:25.271 --> 00:37:31.279]  You take in junk news, read junk information, listen to junk entertainment.
[00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:35.461]  Your soul and your heart experiences junk emotions.
[00:37:36.121 --> 00:37:41.002]  So this whole new safe food trend is going to be huge.
[00:37:41.362 --> 00:37:45.422]  And also, along with it, a new homesteading trend.
[00:37:45.923 --> 00:37:56.184]  Because you have a lot of areas around the country that are dilapidated, and a lot of young people, another one of our trends, I call it Generation F'd.
[00:37:56.624 --> 00:37:58.705]  They call it the Millennial Generation.
[00:37:59.705 --> 00:38:08.616]  These are kids born between 1980 and 2000 that have university degrees in worthlessness.
[00:38:09.257 --> 00:38:12.701]  They have jobs that don't pay them a living wage if they have a job at all.
[00:38:13.783 --> 00:38:15.826]  And they're educated.
[00:38:16.467 --> 00:38:19.411]  And they know that the future is going to be what they make it.
[00:38:20.232 --> 00:38:21.815]  And that's part of the Great Awakening.
[00:38:21.855 --> 00:38:25.219]  So there are a lot of positive things in this Trends Journal as well.
[00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:26.561]  Well, that's really fascinating.
[00:38:26.782 --> 00:38:28.684]  Like you said, it's what, 60, 70 pages?
[00:38:28.744 --> 00:38:29.345]  No commercials?
[00:38:30.206 --> 00:38:31.546]  Sixty pages, yeah.
[00:38:31.626 --> 00:38:32.667]  Yeah, there's a lot of stuff there.
[00:38:33.107 --> 00:38:37.448]  That's really fascinating, and when you're talking about the education thing, I think that's really key.
[00:38:37.488 --> 00:38:51.071]  I think, you know, I've homeschooled my sons all the way through from the start to finish, and it just completely, it's not just a question of what they know and how they can work in the world, but it's also their attitude.
[00:38:51.091 --> 00:38:54.592]  You know, government has been a real, government has used schools
[00:38:55.072 --> 00:38:59.437]  And it's been designed to use schools to control the population the way they think.
[00:38:59.497 --> 00:39:01.199]  It's a major brainwashing operation.
[00:39:01.559 --> 00:39:14.593]  So, once that starts to move away and starts to get decentralized, and people start taking a more active control of their children's education, I think that's going to be really energizing the Great Awakening, as you put it.
[00:39:15.703 --> 00:39:16.484]  Well, thank you very much.
[00:39:16.964 --> 00:39:18.865]  Thank you very much, Gerald Salenti.
[00:39:19.285 --> 00:39:22.628]  I look forward to seeing... I want to read the rest of this Trends Journal here.
[00:39:22.668 --> 00:39:23.768]  You've got me really interested.
[00:39:24.209 --> 00:39:25.309]  Thanks for talking to us today.
[00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:27.051]  Hey, thanks for having me on, David.
[00:39:27.111 --> 00:39:27.591]  Appreciate it.
[00:39:27.711 --> 00:39:27.991]  Bye-bye.
[00:39:29.632 --> 00:39:37.137]  Well, I want to read the rest of the trends that he's got projected for 2013, and if you want to read those, you can get it at TrendsJournal.com.
[00:39:37.598 --> 00:39:41.160]  That's where you can order Gerald Salenti's Trends Journal.
[00:39:42.051 --> 00:39:49.753]  We'll be right back after the break with David Zuniga and someone who has an organization called America Again.
