[00:00:22.287 --> 00:00:27.391]  Good evening, I'm Gigi Erneta with your InfoWars Nightly News this Monday, August 12, 2013.
[00:00:28.091 --> 00:00:29.392]  Here's what's coming up.
[00:00:30.513 --> 00:00:35.997]  Tonight, the NSA has no plans to stop spying, so get used to it, America.
[00:00:36.317 --> 00:00:40.100]  The lies fueling the destructive drug war have begun to crumble.
[00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.363]  And Gigi Erneta sits down with Mike Cargill to discuss your Second Amendment rights.
[00:00:45.824 --> 00:00:48.686]  All this and more on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:53.888 --> 00:00:58.730]  Top story tonight, former NSA boss says that the government's going to continue surveillance.
[00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.210]  So you better get used to it.
[00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:12.574]  Former NSA and CIA boss Michael Hayden went on Face the Nation Sunday and told America the NSA's Fourth Amendment busting surveillance program is lawful, effective, and appropriate.
[00:01:13.334 --> 00:01:16.095]  The oversight regime for this was already quite good.
[00:01:16.635 --> 00:01:18.436]  He pointed out there have been no abuses.
[00:01:19.372 --> 00:01:42.952]  under him or under his predecessor the president is trying to take some steps to make the american people more comfortable about what it is we're doing that's going to be hard because frankly bob some steps to make americans more comfortable will actually make americans less safe you're not reading about is the government actually abusing these programs and
[00:01:44.744 --> 00:01:48.546]  You know, listening in on people's phone calls or inappropriately reading people's emails.
[00:01:48.926 --> 00:02:03.715]  If you are the ordinary person and you start seeing a bunch of headlines saying, U.S., Big Brother, looking down on you, collecting telephone records, etc., well, understandably, people would be concerned.
[00:02:04.675 --> 00:02:09.558]  I would be, too, if I wasn't inside the government.
[00:02:10.231 --> 00:02:17.272]  As you noticed, he was telling the people right in front of him, which was the press, that they weren't really being wiretapped and spied on.
[00:02:18.453 --> 00:02:20.413]  Kind of like what happened last week on Jay Leno.
[00:02:20.833 --> 00:02:22.133]  I had the programs reviewed.
[00:02:22.774 --> 00:02:32.015]  We put in some additional safeguards to make sure that there's federal court oversight as well as congressional oversight, that there is no spying on Americans.
[00:02:32.376 --> 00:02:36.756]  FEMA was demanding 24-hour delivery of emergency food reserves.
[00:02:37.077 --> 00:02:38.837]  This was on our InfoWars page.
[00:02:39.597 --> 00:02:49.200]  FEMA recently contacted MyPatriotSupply, a provider of bulk food reserves, requesting immediate delivery of truckloads of food within a 24-hour period.
[00:02:49.820 --> 00:03:02.364]  Instead of soliciting for the food in the normal manner via the Federal Business Opportunities website and thereby saving money, FEMA is now directly contacting suppliers in order to secure overnight delivery of bulk foods.
[00:03:03.084 --> 00:03:07.606]  The snapshot above shows one of the emails MyPatriotSupply received from FEMA.
[00:03:09.878 --> 00:03:14.124]  Patriot Supply has said that they've decided to decline doing business with them.
[00:03:14.144 --> 00:03:15.546]  So I want to make sure that you know that.
[00:03:16.026 --> 00:03:19.211]  This is a new development and they say that they prefer not to.
[00:03:20.157 --> 00:03:22.799]  Take care of the 24-hour delivery that they were requesting.
[00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:30.324]  Dr. Sanjay Gupta mentions, why I changed my mind on weed, saying he didn't look hard enough until now.
[00:03:30.864 --> 00:03:32.085]  I didn't look far enough.
[00:03:32.806 --> 00:03:37.669]  I didn't review papers from smaller labs in other countries doing some remarkable research.
[00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:43.313]  And I was too dismissive of the loud chorus of legitimate patients whose symptoms improved on cannabis.
[00:03:44.013 --> 00:03:51.095]  They didn't have the science to support that claim, and I now know that when it comes to marijuana, neither of those things are true.
[00:03:51.715 --> 00:03:56.157]  It doesn't have a high potential for abuse, and there are very legitimate medical applications.
[00:03:56.417 --> 00:03:59.938]  In fact, sometimes marijuana is the only thing that works.
[00:04:00.298 --> 00:04:03.059]  Take the case of Charlotte Fiji, who I met in Colorado.
[00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:06.060]  She started having seizures soon after birth.
[00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:12.842]  By age 3, she was having 300 a week, despite being on 7 different medications.
[00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:17.698]  Medical marijuana has calmed her brain, limiting her seizures to two or three a month.
[00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:24.594]  We now know that while estimates vary, marijuana leads to dependence in around 9-10% of its adult users.
[00:04:25.054 --> 00:04:35.520]  By comparison, cocaine, a Schedule II substance with less abuse potential than Schedule I drugs, hooks 20% of those who use it, and around 25% of heroin users become addicted.
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:43.185]  The worst is tobacco, where the number is closer to 30% of smokers, many of whom go on to die because of their addiction.
[00:04:44.145 --> 00:04:48.930]  Meanwhile in Wisconsin, the Solidarity Sing-Along singers are having issues with the police.
[00:04:49.871 --> 00:04:56.078]  They are now telling people not only if they are singing in the Capitol that they'll be arrested, but if you're watching.
[00:04:56.098 --> 00:05:03.867]  They're telling spectators, lawmakers, and even tourists that they can't watch the Solidarity Sing-Along in the Capitol because there's just too many people.
[00:05:24.378 --> 00:05:28.422]  Our Constitution has been decimated by the people that we elected to protect and serve.
[00:05:28.542 --> 00:05:31.085]  Well, in Wisconsin, you'll get arrested if you sing.
[00:05:31.445 --> 00:05:34.888]  If you go to SolidaritySingAlong.org, you'll see what's going on.
[00:05:35.188 --> 00:05:39.312]  This week, they've got up to 85 citations handed out, and they've arrested people.
[00:05:40.353 --> 00:05:42.094]  I am declaring this an unlawful event.
[00:05:42.134 --> 00:05:44.456]  Please leave your group outside or disperse.
[00:06:12.128 --> 00:06:17.269]  Now all of this is happening on the heels of a decision that was made on July 8th by U.S.
[00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:26.492]  District Judge William Conley that the Capitol Police's rule requiring a permit for any gathering of four or more people is unconstitutional.
[00:06:27.072 --> 00:06:31.313]  Conley ruled that the police could only require a permit for groups larger than 20.
[00:06:31.593 --> 00:06:35.574]  And they warned him for a week saying that this was an unlawful event.
[00:06:36.214 --> 00:06:38.995]  At one point there were at least 60 people down there on the floor.
[00:06:39.435 --> 00:06:43.602]  The Capitol Police continued their crackdown in the Rotunda on Thursday.
[00:06:43.722 --> 00:06:46.186]  All of this happening at the Wisconsin State Capitol.
[00:06:49.774 --> 00:06:50.675]  Subject to arrest.
[00:06:50.715 --> 00:06:53.117]  We don't even live in Wisconsin.
[00:06:53.277 --> 00:06:54.218]  So they're tourists.
[00:06:54.238 --> 00:06:58.801]  He told me that it has been declared an unlawful event because there are more than 20 people here.
[00:06:58.861 --> 00:07:06.587]  I told him that I was not with the group that I was watching and that even though I was just watching, just videoing, I had to leave or I would be subject to arrest.
[00:07:06.607 --> 00:07:11.510]  Because we're not saying that you're here spectating, you could be subject to arrest.
[00:07:11.631 --> 00:07:12.211]  Really?
[00:07:12.251 --> 00:07:16.214]  And what happens with the first and fourth amendment?
[00:07:18.234 --> 00:07:22.457]  The fines are up to $200 for assembling without a permit.
[00:07:22.477 --> 00:07:26.499]  So now you have to have a permit to sing at the Wisconsin State Capitol.
[00:07:26.819 --> 00:07:28.300]  Remember, the fight is on.

[00:07:33.844 --> 00:07:36.646]  I'm Gigi Ornette with your InfoWars Nightly News Bulletin.
[00:07:38.607 --> 00:07:41.549]  So in Wisconsin, you get arrested for singing.
[00:07:42.389 --> 00:07:43.430]  There goes our First Amendment.
[00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:49.113]  In Miami, a man who's been locked up for 27 years may see daylight.
[00:07:49.814 --> 00:07:56.859]  He's a British man that's locked up for murder and he may walk away after stunning new evidence he was set up by bent cops and drug cartels.
[00:07:57.839 --> 00:07:58.679]  Finally free him.
[00:07:59.119 --> 00:08:07.341]  He was once a multi-millionaire, food and property magnate, whose horses raced the Queens at Royal Ascot.
[00:08:07.441 --> 00:08:16.283]  Mr. Maharaj has been a prisoner for 27 years, and the first 16 of them on death row, facing the electric chair.
[00:08:16.783 --> 00:08:25.985]  According to papers reviewed by a Florida court last week, Mr. Maharaj was victimized by the pervasive environment of corruption and drug traffic endemic at the time,
[00:08:26.745 --> 00:08:30.468]  The 1980s, when cocaine money entered the bloodstream of the city of Miami.
[00:08:30.928 --> 00:08:47.280]  The result, say these documents, was a respectable businessman with an impeccable legal record found himself trapped by corrupt police officers and witnesses who lied in order to protect the real killers that hit men from Colombia's notorious Medellin drugs cartel.
[00:08:48.061 --> 00:08:54.666]  You might have remembered recently that the Air Force took 24 tons of cocaine to Miami from Costa Rica.
[00:08:54.986 --> 00:08:56.668]  You can see the article on Prison Planet.
[00:08:57.448 --> 00:08:58.989]  So, who's the real criminal?
[00:08:59.998 --> 00:09:05.882]  And in New York, the NYPD stop-and-frisk program was ruled in violation of our rights.
[00:09:06.563 --> 00:09:09.765]  The NYPD's policy of stop-and-frisk tactics violates rights.
[00:09:09.805 --> 00:09:15.969]  The judge rules no one should live in fear of being stopped whenever he leaves his home to go about the activities of daily life.
[00:09:16.449 --> 00:09:17.730]  Schindelin wrote in her opinion.
[00:09:18.431 --> 00:09:22.874]  In that case, incidentally, I think we disproportionately stop whites too much.
[00:09:24.147 --> 00:09:25.088]  And minorities too little.
[00:09:25.268 --> 00:09:28.011]  So Bloomberg says he's going to appeal the ruling.
[00:09:28.531 --> 00:09:32.315]  And that's not surprising, since he's really been pushing the stop-and-frisk program in New York.
[00:09:32.816 --> 00:09:34.818]  And a lot of youth are really having problems with it.
[00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:41.204]  And a lot of people are, too, because they stop a lot of people on the road for basically anything they feel like pulling you over for.
[00:09:41.604 --> 00:09:44.327]  Or if you're walking on a sidewalk, they'll stop and frisk you.
[00:09:45.148 --> 00:09:47.530]  So now for the Daily Quote by Thomas Paine.
[00:09:48.632 --> 00:09:53.075]  The cause of America is in a great measure the cause of all mankind.
[00:09:53.496 --> 00:09:56.478]  The real power lies in we, the people.
[00:09:57.219 --> 00:09:59.000]  So show your support today.

[00:10:08.367 --> 00:10:11.529]  In studio today I have Mike Cargill from Central Texas Gun Works.
[00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:15.913]  Hear what he has to say about the Second Amendment and what your rights are.
[00:10:16.233 --> 00:10:17.314]  Stick around until after the break.

[00:10:44.058 --> 00:10:47.359]  So check it out, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:10:52.344 --> 00:10:58.472]  Authoritarian control freaks throughout history have sought to make populations dependent.
[00:10:59.233 --> 00:11:06.583]  The United Nations openly has talked about using food as a weapon against the third world and the industrialized first world.
[00:11:07.344 --> 00:11:21.794]  State Department Memorandum 200, developed by Henry Kissinger, called for destroying the food capacity, not just of the United States, but every country in the world, so they could use food scarcity as a political weapon of control.
[00:11:22.414 --> 00:11:26.217]  Just a decade ago, less than 10 million Americans were on food stamps.
[00:11:26.717 --> 00:11:28.498]  Four years ago, it was 25 million.
[00:11:28.819 --> 00:11:30.800]  It's now reached almost 50 million.
[00:11:32.441 --> 00:11:35.243]  Socialist healthcare is designed to destroy our healthcare system.
[00:11:35.723 --> 00:11:41.446]  The establishment wants you to be a bunch of cowardly, dumbed-down people who can't stand up for yourselves.
[00:11:41.726 --> 00:11:45.248]  That's why they're rushing to try to restrict citizens owning firearms.
[00:11:45.629 --> 00:11:52.352]  Because since the early 1990s, gun ownership has gone straight up, while violent crime has gone straight down by 49%.
[00:11:55.234 --> 00:12:02.922]  And globalist-controlled strongholds like Chicago and New York, where they've taken the citizens' guns, have the highest crime rates in the world.
[00:12:03.402 --> 00:12:04.283]  What am I getting at here?
[00:12:04.844 --> 00:12:08.367]  The system doesn't want you to be self-sufficient.
[00:12:08.847 --> 00:12:14.513]  That's why I promote the fact that you should go out, buy firearms, and go take lessons and learn how to use them.
[00:12:14.893 --> 00:12:18.357]  I want you to stand up for your birthright of liberty and freedom.
[00:12:18.837 --> 00:12:22.238]  During a serious meltdown, they're going to tell you, hey, you want food?
[00:12:22.638 --> 00:12:23.999]  Turn in your guns.
[00:12:24.379 --> 00:12:27.040]  And that's why we need to put the globalists in check.
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:38.503]  And then finally bring them to checkmate by being self-sufficient, by being prepared, by having a garden, by learning how to can your own foods, by having friends and family,
[00:12:38.643 --> 00:12:38.963]  I don't know.
[00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:05.272]  So give them a call.
[00:13:05.292 --> 00:13:05.552]  800-409-5633.
[00:13:05.592 --> 00:13:06.492]  That's 800-409-5633.

[00:13:51.619 --> 00:13:52.820]  The three-month food supply.
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:57.241]  576 servings of storable food for 91 days.

[00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:08.664]  It's like the Hank Williams Jr.
[00:15:08.704 --> 00:15:08.984]  song.
[00:15:09.605 --> 00:15:11.088]  A country boy can survive.
[00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:14.555]  Because you can't starve us out and you can't make us run.
[00:15:15.256 --> 00:15:18.322]  Because these boys were raised on shotguns.
[00:15:19.366 --> 00:15:21.808]  Well, there aren't really a lot of good old boys left anymore, are there?
[00:15:22.648 --> 00:15:27.071]  And those that are out there are demonized and are enemy number one by Homeland Security.
[00:15:27.672 --> 00:15:30.634]  And good old boys come in all shapes, colors, and sizes.
[00:15:30.934 --> 00:15:36.558]  They're people that aren't chumps, who understand that they're going to take care of their family and that nobody else is.
[00:15:37.198 --> 00:15:40.421]  They're people that understand that if somebody else is taking care of them,
[00:15:41.061 --> 00:15:42.042]  That makes them a slave.
[00:15:42.683 --> 00:15:46.547]  And that the government doesn't want you dependent because they want to build a great future for you.
[00:15:46.767 --> 00:15:49.611]  They want to get you dependent so they can social engineer us.
[00:15:50.411 --> 00:15:56.899]  So the answer is, get self-sufficient, become men again, and tell the New World Order to go straight to hell.
[00:15:57.579 --> 00:16:02.245]  Alex Jones signing off for m4wars.com and eFoods Direct, our great sponsor.
[00:16:07.645 --> 00:16:10.167]  Today I'm talking with Mike Cargo from Texas Gun Works.
[00:16:10.547 --> 00:16:15.511]  We're going to talk about where you can carry a gun as a concealed handgun license gun owner.
[00:16:16.372 --> 00:16:18.054]  Mike, thank you so much for being here on the show.
[00:16:18.074 --> 00:16:19.074]  Thank you for having me.
[00:16:19.555 --> 00:16:23.238]  Wow, so the bill never even made it to the floor it sounds like.
[00:16:23.678 --> 00:16:23.818]  Right.
[00:16:23.838 --> 00:16:29.562]  Conceal Carry on campus never made it, never came up in the special session for the first, second, or third session.
[00:16:30.983 --> 00:16:41.910]  And Conceal Carry on campus, what that is, is we're asking for CHL holders, everyone else, everyone, the people that we have vetted and said that these people can carry everywhere else in the state of Texas.
[00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:45.813]  They can carry in restaurants, gas stations, movie theaters, grocery stores.
[00:16:45.833 --> 00:16:47.094]  They can carry in the bank.
[00:16:47.694 --> 00:16:49.255]  We're saying those people there, 21 and up,
[00:16:50.556 --> 00:17:07.081]  Should be able to carry inside of a building of a college campus all right, so And it so basically you know everywhere else that where there's murder you know Sexual assaults a everywhere else you know you can protect yourself there, but you can't protect yourself on a college campus So this never came up at all
[00:17:07.361 --> 00:17:18.949]  Okay, so if you have a concealed carry license now, and you got it, say, last month, and you don't frequent the University of Texas, say, and you go there unknowingly, they can give you a ticket for that?
[00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:20.130]  With a gun on you?
[00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:22.692]  Well, if you go inside, the building is actually a felony.
[00:17:23.272 --> 00:17:29.697]  Right now, the way the law is, with the CHL, you can have the handgun on a college campus, on the streets, sidewalks, parking lots, or garages.
[00:17:30.057 --> 00:17:30.217]  Okay.
[00:17:30.237 --> 00:17:35.140]  You can't go into the building, you can't go into the soccer field, football field, when there's an activity going on.
[00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:37.661]  You cannot participate in any school-sponsored activity.
[00:17:38.121 --> 00:17:42.844]  But with a concealed hanging license, as long as you stay on the streets, sidewalks, parking lots, or garages, then you're fine.
[00:17:42.864 --> 00:17:44.144]  You can walk all the way through that campus.
[00:17:44.184 --> 00:17:44.905]  Don't go into a building.
[00:17:45.265 --> 00:17:49.168]  So if you have a concealed handgun license, where else can you not go with it?
[00:17:49.508 --> 00:17:49.668]  Sure.
[00:17:50.209 --> 00:17:53.851]  Anywhere where someone decides to post what they call a 30.06 sign.
[00:17:53.871 --> 00:17:53.851]  30.06.
[00:17:54.392 --> 00:17:55.052]  Okay.
[00:17:55.673 --> 00:17:56.773]  You can't carry there.
[00:17:56.813 --> 00:18:05.700]  So any private business owner that owns a business and they don't want CHO holders, concealed handgun license holders, to carry there, they will post a 30.06 sign.
[00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:07.121]  Only the criminals can carry.
[00:18:07.728 --> 00:18:08.509]  Okay, right.
[00:18:08.769 --> 00:18:10.790]  Only the criminals can do anything they want, right?
[00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:11.191]  Right.
[00:18:11.231 --> 00:18:13.632]  Okay, so they usually put those signs in front of the business.
[00:18:13.812 --> 00:18:14.193]  Correct.
[00:18:14.293 --> 00:18:20.837]  And of course, you know, you can't carry in your federal billings, you can't go into the courthouse, anything like that.
[00:18:21.898 --> 00:18:23.679]  So those are some of the things you want to look out for.
[00:18:23.699 --> 00:18:25.681]  And we go over all this stuff in class.
[00:18:26.741 --> 00:18:28.463]  Now there's some changes coming to the class, right?
[00:18:28.623 --> 00:18:29.824]  Yes, that is correct.
[00:18:30.064 --> 00:18:36.370]  Starting September the 1st of this year, you'll be able to attend a course and it'll be shorter for you.
[00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:41.194]  Right now it's 10 to 15 hours, and then starting September the 1st it'll be 4 to 6 hours.
[00:18:41.334 --> 00:18:45.918]  Well that sure does make it a lot easier for the person who wants to get a license, but how good is that really?
[00:18:45.938 --> 00:18:46.839]  Are you learning less?
[00:18:46.879 --> 00:18:47.700]  Are you just cramming?
[00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:52.444]  No, a lot of times we can cover the information in a short period of time.
[00:18:52.905 --> 00:18:58.810]  We're actually prolonging that class and stretching it out, showing a lot of videos to make it go 10 hours.
[00:18:59.211 --> 00:19:03.755]  So most of the time we actually can, you know, do it in four or five hours, six hours.
[00:19:03.815 --> 00:19:04.816]  We can reduce that time.
[00:19:05.237 --> 00:19:06.538]  And so we're saying, hey, you know,
[00:19:06.958 --> 00:19:11.362]  And actually, in reality, it should be a constitutional right.
[00:19:11.402 --> 00:19:12.604]  You really shouldn't need a class.
[00:19:12.644 --> 00:19:14.185]  You shouldn't be made to go to a class.
[00:19:14.605 --> 00:19:21.692]  You know, you have the right to carry a firearm and protect yourself as long as you're a law-abiding citizen, so you shouldn't have to sit through a course in the first place.
[00:19:22.052 --> 00:19:24.595]  What are the benefits for someone who's going into a class?
[00:19:24.635 --> 00:19:27.498]  What would you say to somebody who's thinking about doing it but is kind of on the fence?
[00:19:28.382 --> 00:19:40.687]  I would suggest they take a beginner course first, learn everything about that firearm, learn how to shoot it, learn the safety surrounding that firearm and making sure that your children or any unauthorized individuals don't get access to it.
[00:19:41.687 --> 00:19:49.615]  So that seems to be a pretty big problem, people not putting them in safes or locking up their weapons.
[00:19:49.795 --> 00:19:54.179]  Right, and that's when personal responsibility kicks into play.
[00:19:54.740 --> 00:20:00.886]  You, as an adult, you're responsible for making sure that firearm doesn't get into the hands of the wrong person.
[00:20:01.466 --> 00:20:03.568]  And there are a lot of gun shows going on right now.
[00:20:03.668 --> 00:20:05.850]  If you want to purchase a gun, I mean, it's amazing.
[00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:08.072]  I went to one a few weeks ago and it was packed.
[00:20:08.452 --> 00:20:09.533]  Actually, it was over-packed.
[00:20:10.374 --> 00:20:11.835]  But they're changing some of that, too.
[00:20:11.875 --> 00:20:15.278]  You mentioned something about this square thing that goes on the phone.
[00:20:15.959 --> 00:20:20.903]  For our viewers who might not know, it goes on top of your phone and you can swipe a credit card.
[00:20:20.923 --> 00:20:22.865]  You don't even have to have a machine to do it.
[00:20:23.825 --> 00:20:28.810]  That is causing a little bit of a ruckus inside of the sales at the gun shows and other places, right?
[00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:42.761]  In fact, whenever I do business at my store or if I do business at a gun show, I still have to do a background check and all that stuff and process the person's transaction, whether I'm going to accept cash, check, or credit card.
[00:20:43.181 --> 00:20:46.143]  If I'm going to take a credit card, I use Square.
[00:20:46.504 --> 00:20:57.813]  Well, no longer am I going to use Square because they came out just a week or so ago stating that they were not going to allow firearm purchases using their credit card processing.
[00:20:58.473 --> 00:21:02.395]  So, you know, hey, if they don't want our money, you know, then we're not going to do business with them.
[00:21:02.816 --> 00:21:06.278]  Did they give you a sheet or anything that said why they wouldn't allow Square?
[00:21:06.298 --> 00:21:08.639]  No, I saw a report.
[00:21:08.799 --> 00:21:12.081]  It was in a news report and it's chattered and going back and forth online.
[00:21:12.462 --> 00:21:18.325]  They said, hey, you know, they're not going to allow you to use Square when you're doing firearms transactions.
[00:21:18.865 --> 00:21:20.606]  I said, hey, so we're you know, we're done with that.
[00:21:20.907 --> 00:21:27.511]  And I'm asking people, I'm asking someone out there who wants a business venture, you know, because I'm not going to get mad at Square.
[00:21:28.231 --> 00:21:30.632]  I'm going to say, hey, if you don't want our money, we're not going to give it to you.
[00:21:30.772 --> 00:21:30.912]  Right.
[00:21:31.172 --> 00:21:45.016]  But if you want a business venture, you want to start something out and go forward with something, come up with your own processing, your credit card processing company and go forth because now you have an opportunity to get the gun community behind you.
[00:21:45.316 --> 00:21:45.776]  Absolutely.
[00:21:45.816 --> 00:21:46.997]  And that's a big community.
[00:21:47.237 --> 00:21:47.457]  Yes.
[00:21:48.117 --> 00:21:50.478]  So, OK, we've talked about Square a little bit.
[00:21:50.498 --> 00:21:52.778]  What are you seeing in the trends as far as purchasing?
[00:21:52.798 --> 00:21:53.859]  What are the changes you've seen?
[00:21:56.818 --> 00:21:58.399]  Ammunition is coming back a little bit.
[00:21:59.899 --> 00:22:05.620]  Also, more manufacturers are getting their firearms out there, so we're getting more inventory.
[00:22:06.061 --> 00:22:07.341]  So that's good.
[00:22:07.601 --> 00:22:13.643]  We're getting away from the big rush that we had early in the year, like January, February, and March.
[00:22:13.823 --> 00:22:17.884]  So now we've got our inventory, we've got our ammunition, so it's starting to look good now.
[00:22:17.904 --> 00:22:19.024]  We're getting ready for the wintertime.
[00:22:19.104 --> 00:22:19.984]  What about 9mm?
[00:22:20.004 --> 00:22:20.505]  Can you find it?
[00:22:22.245 --> 00:22:24.046]  I'm saving that 9mm for our students.
[00:22:24.306 --> 00:22:24.726]  Oh, I see.
[00:22:24.786 --> 00:22:25.567]  I see how you are.
[00:22:25.587 --> 00:22:27.007]  It's coming in.
[00:22:27.027 --> 00:22:27.828]  What about the girls?
[00:22:28.008 --> 00:22:29.488]  I hear that there's a lot of pink.
[00:22:29.768 --> 00:22:29.868]  Yes.
[00:22:29.888 --> 00:22:30.449]  Is that true?
[00:22:30.969 --> 00:22:31.309]  Oh, yes.
[00:22:31.329 --> 00:22:33.450]  We're coming out with pink holsters.
[00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:35.491]  We have this nice new holster that we have.
[00:22:35.691 --> 00:22:37.391]  It's a bra holster.
[00:22:37.611 --> 00:22:40.533]  We made our first pink one and it's for a 380.
[00:22:42.043 --> 00:22:44.084]  And so the ladies can actually clip it to their bra.
[00:22:44.605 --> 00:22:47.527]  And so, you know, some people call it a flash bang.
[00:22:47.567 --> 00:22:49.228]  I think someone's got that name or whatever.
[00:22:49.248 --> 00:22:49.568]  Right.
[00:22:49.588 --> 00:22:50.629]  You call them a bra holster.
[00:22:50.669 --> 00:22:57.193]  So when someone wants a sexual assault, you pull it up, you give them, you show them what they want to see, and then you pull that gun out and then give them what they don't want.
[00:22:57.213 --> 00:22:58.174]  Right.
[00:22:58.254 --> 00:22:58.834]  Nice.
[00:22:58.994 --> 00:22:59.455]  Nice.
[00:22:59.575 --> 00:23:00.235]  Flash bang.
[00:23:00.495 --> 00:23:00.996]  Exactly.
[00:23:01.736 --> 00:23:04.538]  Wow, that just gives a whole new meaning to concealing, doesn't it?
[00:23:04.578 --> 00:23:05.119]  Exactly.
[00:23:05.739 --> 00:23:06.080]  Okay.
[00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:09.082]  Also, what have you seen as far as the ammunition?
[00:23:09.122 --> 00:23:13.445]  You said that you can't get a hold of 9mm so much, but what about the hollow point?
[00:23:13.526 --> 00:23:16.368]  What do you see as far as coming out from manufacturing right now?
[00:23:16.388 --> 00:23:17.909]  Are there any changes, anything new?
[00:23:18.349 --> 00:23:20.051]  Yeah, 9mm hollow point's coming out.
[00:23:20.511 --> 00:23:21.952]  There's a lot of that right now.
[00:23:21.992 --> 00:23:23.453]  Also, .45 is coming back.
[00:23:23.894 --> 00:23:26.256]  So, the stock is definitely replenishing.
[00:23:26.636 --> 00:23:27.957]  So, it's coming back in.
[00:23:28.137 --> 00:23:28.977]  Well, that's a good sign.
[00:23:28.997 --> 00:23:48.523]  That probably means that they are coming up with bigger weapons, and so the ammunition is just... Your manufacturers are actually starting to catch up a little bit, and a lot of that is because your Department of Homeland Security decided that they were going to stockpile so much ammunition, getting ready for whatever they're getting ready for, so that depleted stock, plus people were
[00:23:50.091 --> 00:24:04.361]  What the president said in his current administration of coming after everyone's guns, people started to say, well, maybe we should start hiding some ammunition and stuff like that in our homes, because we're not sure what the government's going to do.
[00:24:04.601 --> 00:24:08.483]  It's hard to tell, because there's not a lot of truth coming from a D.C.
[00:24:08.524 --> 00:24:09.704]  district of criminals.
[00:24:10.085 --> 00:24:10.525]  Exactly.
[00:24:10.865 --> 00:24:16.790]  So, speaking of Department of Homeland Security here in Austin, they're going to be doing some kind of training in the next three weeks.
[00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:21.875]  I don't know if you heard about it, but should we be on the lookout for anything, would you say?
[00:24:21.895 --> 00:24:23.937]  I'll tell you, have your cameras ready.
[00:24:25.318 --> 00:24:28.281]  Be aware and make sure that you don't have any false reporting going on.
[00:24:28.681 --> 00:24:34.046]  You know, you don't have some cover-up of some other activities or something like that.
[00:24:34.306 --> 00:24:35.748]  So definitely be on your P's and Q's.
[00:24:36.608 --> 00:24:43.232]  I'm always skeptical whenever, you know, DHS steps into a town, there's something weird always happens.
[00:24:43.392 --> 00:24:44.712]  Right, it seems like it.
[00:24:44.732 --> 00:24:45.713]  DHS, hmm.
[00:24:45.953 --> 00:24:48.134]  Especially when you have the University of Texas involved.
[00:24:48.314 --> 00:24:53.537]  Yeah, you know, they were flying the Doomsday Plane here a few weeks ago, and that alone gives you that creepy vibe.
[00:24:53.917 --> 00:25:00.901]  But to think you mix that up with the Department of Homeland Security and it being right at your front doorstep, makes you want to lock the car doors when you're driving, doesn't it?
[00:25:00.981 --> 00:25:01.661]  Oh yes, it does.
[00:25:01.682 --> 00:25:02.282]  Gotta be aware.
[00:25:02.942 --> 00:25:06.145]  Okay, did you see the urban assault vehicles that they've been giving to the police departments?
[00:25:06.386 --> 00:25:07.407]  No, I have not.
[00:25:07.427 --> 00:25:08.348]  Yeah, take a look at that.
[00:25:08.408 --> 00:25:09.108]  That'll wake you up.
[00:25:09.529 --> 00:25:09.609]  Ugh.
[00:25:10.229 --> 00:25:12.211]  Seems like the military's been doing some donating.
[00:25:13.232 --> 00:25:15.414]  Well, you know, people need to get out there.
[00:25:16.635 --> 00:25:17.857]  Purchase that firearm.
[00:25:19.036 --> 00:25:24.559]  Learn the safety surrounding that farm and learn how to use it and protect themselves, get you some ammunition and stockpile it.
[00:25:24.839 --> 00:25:29.302]  Because I'm telling you, when they come after your guns, give them your bullets first.
[00:25:29.942 --> 00:25:32.664]  Hey, and tell us more about your place, about your store.
[00:25:32.684 --> 00:25:38.187]  Central Texas Gunner Works, we actually just started doing level 3, level 2, level 3, level 4 private security.
[00:25:38.927 --> 00:25:43.368]  We also do beginning handgun class, we do concealed handgun class, and advanced pistol courses.
[00:25:44.408 --> 00:25:55.771]  We like to try to help people deploy that firearm when they need it for self-defense, whether they're going to carry it inside their ankle, on their strong side, small the back, or for the ladies inside that purse.
[00:25:56.031 --> 00:25:56.231]  Right.
[00:25:56.291 --> 00:25:57.931]  Or in their bra, huh?
[00:25:58.071 --> 00:25:59.731]  Or in their bra.
[00:26:00.031 --> 00:26:05.593]  We want to help them present that firearm, you know, to stop that threat, because they may only have three or four seconds to draw that firearm.
[00:26:05.953 --> 00:26:07.373]  What's the next class you have coming up?
[00:26:08.089 --> 00:26:10.791]  We have a concealed handgun class that's going on right now.
[00:26:10.831 --> 00:26:12.432]  We have a concealed handgun class going on on Saturday.
[00:26:12.452 --> 00:26:19.056]  We do them every Saturday, every other Sunday, every other Thursday, every other Tuesday, and we do private one-on-one classes.
[00:26:19.116 --> 00:26:20.177]  Okay, so you do it all the time?
[00:26:20.257 --> 00:26:21.317]  We do it all the time.
[00:26:21.678 --> 00:26:24.039]  Alright, well I just want to thank you so much for being here, Michael.
[00:26:24.079 --> 00:26:24.800]  This is exciting.
[00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:25.900]  Wow, thank you for having me.
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:29.663]  And like I said, when they come after your guns, give them your bullets first.
[00:26:30.063 --> 00:26:31.104]  Oh, okay, there you go.
[00:26:32.164 --> 00:26:32.545]  Thank you.
[00:26:32.725 --> 00:26:33.065]  Thank you.
