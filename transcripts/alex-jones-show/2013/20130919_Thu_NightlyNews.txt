[00:00:22.228 --> 00:00:24.109]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:25.469]  I'm your host, Jakari Jackson.
[00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.631]  Here's what we have in store for you on this September 19th, 2013 edition.
[00:00:30.852 --> 00:00:38.855]  Tonight, on the InfoWars Nightly News, a large-scale martial law drill is making last-minute preparations for November.
[00:00:39.475 --> 00:00:40.176]  Are you ready?
[00:00:40.696 --> 00:00:46.198]  Plus, confirmed, Navy Yard Shooter was on antidepressant Trazodone.
[00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:49.560]  All that and more on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:54.912 --> 00:00:59.933]  Top story tonight, confirmed Navy Yard shooter was on antidepressant Trazodone.
[00:01:00.193 --> 00:01:01.474]  This is by Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:01:02.034 --> 00:01:13.016]  It's been confirmed that the Navy Yard gunman, Aaron Alexis, was on the antidepressant drug Trazodone, providing yet another example of a connection between psychiatric drugs and mass shootings.
[00:01:13.357 --> 00:01:18.978]  Despite the Washington Post attempts to portray the drug as being safe, it is linked to a whole host of side effects.
[00:01:19.298 --> 00:01:22.542]  Including suicidal tendencies, panic attacks, and other things.
[00:01:22.923 --> 00:01:30.231]  And just one example right here, we have eight people were killed and one wounded during a mass shooting in a beauty parlor in Seal Beach, California in 2011.
[00:01:30.412 --> 00:01:35.578]  The killer, Scott Evan Dekarai, was on the same drug as Alexis.
[00:01:35.598 --> 00:01:38.782]  I'm sure this is no surprise to anybody who follows these mass shootings.
[00:01:39.102 --> 00:01:40.763]  Now we have two breaking news stories.
[00:01:40.783 --> 00:01:42.724]  We'll start with this one out of Fukushima.
[00:01:42.764 --> 00:01:46.627]  There's been an earthquake at the Fukushima plant or near the Fukushima plant.
[00:01:46.867 --> 00:01:54.212]  Now this is a very serious situation because people understand the Fukushima plant has been responsible for dumping a good amount of radiation.
[00:01:54.472 --> 00:01:58.314]  They're also dumping radioactive water back into the ocean and so forth.
[00:01:58.635 --> 00:02:02.337]  So a damaged plant with these rods that are pretty much exposed
[00:02:02.757 --> 00:02:02.957]  I think?
[00:02:21.035 --> 00:02:25.119]  FBI, Chicago passes New York as murder capital of the United States.
[00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:34.167]  And keep in mind, Chicago has some of the strictest gun laws in the country, in the United States of America, but it's still the murder capital of the country.
[00:02:34.187 --> 00:02:41.894]  And you would think that a city that has such strict gun control would have an easier job of keeping their crime down, their violent crime down, but no.
[00:02:42.194 --> 00:02:43.576]  Now let's take a look at these numbers here.
[00:02:43.596 --> 00:02:44.757]  You can see it right there on Fox.
[00:02:46.062 --> 00:02:47.523]  And let's take a look at all the cities right here.
[00:02:47.583 --> 00:02:51.466]  I see Dallas at 154, Memphis 133, Oakland 126, and Chicago, New York, Detroit 386.
[00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:05.382]  Wow, that's a very hefty number right there, and you see Indianapolis rounding out the bottom at 101.
[00:03:05.462 --> 00:03:17.387]  And, you know, we say these things, this is gallus humor, of course I'm not happy that anybody in these cities were murdered, but it just goes to show that gun control doesn't work, especially when these people do not have the proper means to defend themselves.
[00:03:18.147 --> 00:03:21.049]  Matt Drudge and Alex Jones, 17-year-old bloggers.
[00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:25.913]  Now, you'll be able to see Matt Drudge's tweet calling Mrs. Feinstein a fascist.
[00:03:25.933 --> 00:03:27.154]  Senator Feinstein, that is.
[00:03:27.695 --> 00:03:35.681]  And the article goes on to say, Senator Feinstein and another Democrat, New York Senator Chuck Schumer, are pushing a bill that claims to shield journalists from the government.
[00:03:36.141 --> 00:03:45.632]  Fine Stein and Schumer like to pretend the proposed laws offer legal protections to journalists engaged in news gathering activities, protections already afforded by the First Amendment.
[00:03:45.952 --> 00:03:51.538]  If the government decides, however, it has reasonable exceptions under national security, it will allow
[00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:56.582]  Federal law enforcement to compel information that would mitigate terrorist activities.
[00:03:57.063 --> 00:04:17.037]  So, in short, this is going to say that if you're a real journalist and you go out there and you have sources and you have people who contact you with information, if the government decides that this person is a terrorist or if you yourself are engaged in any type of terrorist activity, you will be forced to give up your sources and I guess give up yourself as a thing may go on to be.
[00:04:17.057 --> 00:04:20.420]  And remind, just remind yourself that Senator Feinstein
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:25.561]  Mrs. Feinstein has said that you're not a real journalist unless you meet her definition of what a real journalist is.
[00:04:25.601 --> 00:04:41.666]  Somebody who earns a salary, and I assure you I meet many people when I go out in the streets, people who make little to no money doing this journalism, doing their activism and so forth, are just as good as anybody else you see on the major networks, and their opinions and insights are just as valid.
[00:04:42.066 --> 00:04:43.846]  So keep that in mind, Mrs. Feinstein.
[00:04:43.866 --> 00:04:48.108]  Quit trying to tell us how to do our job until you can learn how to do yours by reading the Constitution.
[00:04:48.568 --> 00:04:49.368]  We'll move to this now.
[00:04:49.768 --> 00:05:00.303]  We'll be uploading our entire minds to computers by 2045, Google expert claims, and of course this expert is one Mr. Ray Kurzweil, Director of Engineering at Google.
[00:05:00.603 --> 00:05:06.771]  He also claims that the biological parts of our body will be replaced with mechanical parts, and this could happen as early as...
[00:05:07.372 --> 00:05:07.732]  The year 2100.
[00:05:09.053 --> 00:05:15.876]  Kurzweil made the claims during his conference speech at the Global Futures 2045 International Congress in New York.
[00:05:16.236 --> 00:05:16.876]  Kurzweil said,
[00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.331]  Now this all goes into the singularity.
[00:05:30.611 --> 00:05:43.155]  And what the singularity is, it's basically the merging of yourself with a machine, giving yourself digital immortality, similar to what you see in the Superman movies, where Superman's father lives on forever in the Fortress of Solitude and so forth.
[00:05:43.375 --> 00:05:44.735]  So this is what Kurzweil wants to do.
[00:05:44.775 --> 00:05:48.276]  He wants to become a real cyborg, Terminator, Iron Man.
[00:05:48.836 --> 00:05:53.698]  And he says he doesn't believe in God, but he'll believe in God once he becomes the singularity.
[00:05:54.338 --> 00:06:01.213]  Coming up after the break, we'll have an in-depth report on the Rothschild family and the occult symbolism they use to celebrate their evil.
[00:06:01.553 --> 00:06:05.441]  And also stick around after that, I'll be talking to David Seaman of the Rise Morning Show.
[00:06:31.431 --> 00:06:34.792]  The Alex Jones Channel is the official page of The Info War.
[00:06:35.192 --> 00:06:37.513]  But don't miss what's happening on our other channels.

[00:08:14.961 --> 00:08:15.642]  And welcome back.
[00:08:16.122 --> 00:08:20.123]  We see the strange symbolism in the Super Bowl in our films and TV shows.
[00:08:21.064 --> 00:08:23.025]  What is it and how did it grow to predominance?
[00:08:23.465 --> 00:08:25.946]  InfoWars.com has a special investigative report.
[00:08:30.509 --> 00:08:37.257]  Did you know Stanley Kubrick filmed his famous movie Eyes Wide Shut inside the Rothschild family's country estate?
[00:08:49.226 --> 00:08:55.430]  Theories swirl that Kubrick made his movie about the real-life Ultra Elite and their secret occultic gatherings.
[00:08:55.890 --> 00:09:01.354]  Well, take a look at these pictures that show an actual Rothschild event from 1972.
[00:09:01.854 --> 00:09:07.298]  On the surface, it looks like a pretty magnificent surrealist ball, but there are clear occult references.
[00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:14.602]  Much like the film Eyes Wide Shut, occult imagery is hidden throughout the night, starting with the invitations, which were written backwards.
[00:09:14.802 --> 00:09:19.565]  Reversal or inversion of sacred objects is typical of black magic and satanic rituals.
[00:09:19.866 --> 00:09:26.230]  The exterior of the Chateau de Ferrier is lit up in a moving orange light, giving it the appearance of a fiery inferno.
[00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:28.371]  Here's some MK Ultra programming.
[00:09:28.931 --> 00:09:31.413]  Many guests are wearing masks with multiple faces.
[00:09:31.673 --> 00:09:45.989]  Victims of MK-ALTER programming report systematic and ritualized pedophilia, drug and sexual abuse, and torture designed to deliberately shatter the minds of victims into multiple personalities called ALTERs, which can be molded and manipulated at will.
[00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:52.912]  This hat, designed by Dali, also has hidden symbolism of androgyny by having half of Mona Lisa's face.
[00:09:53.212 --> 00:09:57.673]  Harnessing the male and female power is important to practitioners of the left-hand path.
[00:09:58.113 --> 00:10:09.876]  And although Dali traditionally paints ants and grasshoppers in his paintings to evoke death, decay, and trauma, this work of art has scarab beetles, which symbolize the Egyptian mysticism of Osiris, the Sun King.
[00:10:10.296 --> 00:10:16.000]  Bird cages weren't just a popular costume, but they also symbolize physical and psychological bondage.
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:20.403]  This guest's costume resembles the famous painting, Son of Man, by Magritte.
[00:10:20.623 --> 00:10:26.287]  Both the apple and the eye of Horus symbolize the forbidden knowledge of Lucifer in the Garden of Eden.
[00:10:26.807 --> 00:10:32.991]  The hostess, Marie-Hélène de Rothschild, is seen wearing a giant horned head, crying real diamond tears.
[00:10:33.632 --> 00:10:39.856]  Is this a representation of the sacrifice to Baphomet, who will share wealth and riches only after sacrifice?
[00:10:40.656 --> 00:10:49.259]  It's not exactly clear when in 1972 this party took place, but from the look of the decorations and the menu, it's definitely a fertility ritual.
[00:10:49.779 --> 00:11:02.003]  The dinner table serves dismembered dolls and cracked skulls, a possible reference to MKUltra doll programming, and the lifelessness of their victims who literally crack after their mind control wiring goes haywire.
[00:11:02.583 --> 00:11:05.487]  For dessert, a human sacrifice in a bed of roses.
[00:11:05.667 --> 00:11:15.619]  The rose, of course, is a symbol used by many secret societies, and it represents virginity, fertility, sexuality, and immortality, as well as silence and secrecy.
[00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:19.024]  Here's Salvador Dali, who helmed the Surrealist movement.
[00:11:19.324 --> 00:11:22.325]  At first, this could seem like a Surrealism party in his honor.
[00:11:22.505 --> 00:11:25.045]  But consider the aims of the Surrealism movement itself.
[00:11:25.225 --> 00:11:31.886]  To resolve the contradictory condition of dreams versus reality, and allow the unconscious mind to express itself.
[00:11:32.266 --> 00:11:34.747]  Occult imagery is very real, and it's everywhere.
[00:11:34.967 --> 00:11:37.847]  In movies, television, music, and fashion.
[00:11:38.307 --> 00:11:44.888]  The power derived from these occult symbols and imagery is very real to the elitists that congregate in their separate reality.
[00:11:44.908 --> 00:11:48.469]  So shall we prune thee once again this night?
[00:11:50.101 --> 00:11:59.025]  And, in the flames of deep kind empathy, we shall read the sign, Midsommar sets us free!
[00:11:59.065 --> 00:12:02.447]  You burned me once again!
[00:12:02.647 --> 00:12:08.829]  Not with me!
[00:12:08.869 --> 00:12:12.091]  Midsommar sets us free!
[00:12:22.949 --> 00:12:24.590]  And that is just the tip of the iceberg.
[00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:30.375]  The elites are riddled with perverse secret societies that are obsessed with harnessing the power of dark forces.
[00:12:31.235 --> 00:12:46.867]  For over a hundred years, Skull & Bones members have included a president, vice presidents, Supreme Court justices, congressmen and senators, captains of science and industry, the very best of America.
[00:12:54.468 --> 00:12:58.251]  There's the public perception of the occult and then what is actually happening.
[00:12:58.652 --> 00:13:06.659]  It's fantasy and folklore versus the real intangible dark power that the elite are able to harness by being practitioners of the occult.
[00:13:07.219 --> 00:13:14.064]  And it's this very art and imagery that we see over and over again that it's just the expression of their dark souls.
[00:13:14.605 --> 00:13:26.513]  To see just how far down the rabbit hole this goes, pick up a copy of Bloodlines of the Illuminati by Fritz Springmeier and the double DVD special Dark Secrets Inside the Bohemian Grove plus The Order of Death.
[00:13:26.814 --> 00:13:29.295]  It's two incredible films on one DVD.
[00:13:29.516 --> 00:13:32.097]  Get your copy today at InfoWarsHop.com.
[00:13:32.398 --> 00:13:35.280]  I'm Leanne McAdoo reporting for the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:13:43.277 --> 00:13:47.741]  And this occult culture is just so out in the open now it's even in the new Grand Theft Auto 5.
[00:13:48.201 --> 00:13:54.527]  Now something else that's coming out in the open is a new FEMA drill that's set to black out the United States in a simulated attack.
[00:13:54.947 --> 00:13:56.509]  Infowars.com has more.
[00:14:00.905 --> 00:14:03.006]  Marshall Law is coming to a town near you.
[00:14:03.086 --> 00:14:06.427]  Get ready for Grid X2, the grid security exercise.
[00:14:06.487 --> 00:14:10.068]  It's a multinational terror drill and it's scheduled to take place in the coming months.
[00:14:10.328 --> 00:14:17.870]  Supposedly it aims at assessing, testing, and validating vital infrastructure resources should they come under an unlikely cyber attack.
[00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:21.731]  It's scheduled for November in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.
[00:14:22.211 --> 00:14:23.531]  So get ready for Marshall Law.
[00:14:23.791 --> 00:14:25.232]  They can put that in place right away.
[00:14:25.792 --> 00:14:31.416]  And remember, Janet Napolitano said earlier this year that it's not a matter of if, but when it happens.
[00:14:32.016 --> 00:14:37.699]  And it's already happened in Venezuela when it froze transportation, business, and overall communication in that area.
[00:14:37.939 --> 00:14:45.644]  In FEMA Region 3, they're preparing for something of a large magnitude, putting out bids for contractors demanding delivery in under 48 hours.
[00:14:45.664 --> 00:14:48.286]  Now these items include various things such as clothing,
[00:14:49.447 --> 00:14:56.432]  100,000 scrub pants and shirts, sweatshirts, 6 million cotton blankets, all to be ordered by October 1st, 2013.
[00:14:56.852 --> 00:15:01.396]  And the Center for Disease Control ordered $11 million worth of antibiotics.
[00:15:01.536 --> 00:15:13.766]  Remember, the DHS earlier this year had been buying up billions of rounds of ammo, and the IRS ramped up with AR-15s, FEMA buying millions of MREs, and they've moved Coast Guard training from their normal training area
[00:15:14.346 --> 00:15:15.287]  To Region 3.
[00:15:15.567 --> 00:15:26.995]  West Virginia has already had a taste of the police state during the Boy Scouts Jamboree, as citizens witnessed foreign troops on the ground, snipers, Blackhawks, and even notices from health services warning of airborne viruses.
[00:15:27.275 --> 00:15:32.559]  And in Maryland, they recently showcased their military-style vehicles on the freeway during a funeral.
[00:15:33.019 --> 00:15:33.880]  Martial law is coming.
[00:15:51.081 --> 00:15:55.384]  Martial law is coming, but don't worry, your government is preparing to save you.
[00:15:56.324 --> 00:15:59.046]  I'm Gigi Ornette with this InfoWars Nightly News Report.
[00:16:01.383 --> 00:16:07.786]  And from the Department of Homeland Security planning massive blackout drills to the Department of Homeland Security harassing lawful gun owners.
[00:16:08.166 --> 00:16:15.929]  I was in the streets earlier this week when Oath Keepers tell me that they are harassed for merely walking down the street in the United States of America.
[00:16:20.351 --> 00:16:24.973]  Well, we circled the Capitol here a few times and we didn't see a good place to park, so we went.
[00:16:25.649 --> 00:16:26.690]  8th and Hedges.
[00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:28.230]  Parked over there.
[00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:31.352]  We got our rifles and started up here.
[00:16:31.832 --> 00:16:38.756]  We walked past a federal facility and a federal officer come out up behind us.
[00:16:39.694 --> 00:16:42.716]  He drew his weapon and ordered us to stop.
[00:16:42.756 --> 00:16:49.620]  We wouldn't even let him show what he wanted to show out of his wallet.
[00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:51.461]  He's got a CHL.
[00:16:51.522 --> 00:16:54.683]  He asked us if we'd mind if he removed the magazines.
[00:16:54.703 --> 00:16:56.024]  We said go ahead.
[00:16:57.125 --> 00:16:59.126]  He checked to make sure there wasn't one chamber.
[00:16:59.146 --> 00:17:05.010]  Then there were five other officers positioned behind cars and stuff.
[00:17:05.916 --> 00:17:14.482]  And the guy in charge over there at that federal building, he came out and he's familiar with open carry Texas, so he was okay with everything.
[00:17:15.003 --> 00:17:21.127]  But the one that drew his weapon, he did not know that you can carry a long gun in Texas.
[00:17:21.347 --> 00:17:23.569]  And he was a federal officer or security guard?
[00:17:23.709 --> 00:17:26.171]  Well, he was wearing a blue security
[00:17:26.787 --> 00:17:27.148]  Sure.
[00:17:27.388 --> 00:17:28.509]  Different than the others.
[00:17:28.529 --> 00:17:29.330]  You said DHS, sir?
[00:17:29.351 --> 00:17:30.192]  DHS.
[00:17:30.212 --> 00:17:31.253]  That's who he was with?
[00:17:31.293 --> 00:17:32.715]  That's who those two were.
[00:17:36.929 --> 00:17:40.232]  They asked for ID, and we refused to provide ID.
[00:17:41.073 --> 00:17:43.535]  Most officers were okay with that.
[00:17:43.575 --> 00:17:46.999]  The DHS, he had a problem with it.
[00:17:47.119 --> 00:17:48.540]  So let me clarify, sir.
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:53.465]  You're saying that the DHS officer, the Department of Homeland Security officer, is the one who actually threw a pistol?
[00:17:53.485 --> 00:17:53.845]  No, no.
[00:17:53.865 --> 00:17:54.406]  Security.
[00:17:54.546 --> 00:17:55.287]  Okay, security.
[00:17:55.387 --> 00:17:56.628]  Okay, thank you.
[00:17:56.708 --> 00:17:59.450]  And then the Department of Homeland Security officer came after that.
[00:18:00.911 --> 00:18:05.454]  Oh, the dark blue or DHS?
[00:18:05.494 --> 00:18:13.178]  And they detained us until Austin PD came and spoke with him.
[00:18:13.758 --> 00:18:17.440]  I got up to speak with him also, and he told me to sit back down.
[00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:18.801]  He just wanted to speak to him.
[00:18:19.141 --> 00:18:22.823]  Now, did you guys have your firearms on you during this time while you were detained?
[00:18:22.883 --> 00:18:23.263]  Yes, sir.
[00:18:23.323 --> 00:18:25.464]  Okay, so they let us keep the firearms?
[00:18:25.484 --> 00:18:26.585]  They let us keep the firearms.
[00:18:27.245 --> 00:18:31.627]  They asked permission to remove the magazine and we allowed that.
[00:18:31.788 --> 00:18:35.469]  About how long were you detained?
[00:18:35.489 --> 00:18:36.430]  About 20 minutes.
[00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:36.730]  20 minutes?
[00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:45.715]  We had to wait for Austin PD to come because the federal guy said if Austin didn't have a problem with it we would be free to go.
[00:18:47.363 --> 00:18:48.604]  We were just detained for 15-20 minutes.
[00:18:48.744 --> 00:18:50.445]  Enough to be late getting up here.
[00:18:50.465 --> 00:18:51.585]  It was all good in the end.
[00:18:51.605 --> 00:18:53.906]  They wanted to make a big issue out of the shootings yesterday.
[00:18:53.946 --> 00:18:55.907]  Y'all shouldn't be doing that today.
[00:19:04.591 --> 00:19:09.096]  Our rights haven't changed from today to yesterday.
[00:19:09.116 --> 00:19:10.938]  We may have more so than even today.
[00:19:10.979 --> 00:19:13.602]  So what do you think about all these guns out here?
[00:19:14.783 --> 00:19:15.604]  I don't know, man.
[00:19:15.764 --> 00:19:16.084]  Don't know?
[00:19:17.725 --> 00:19:18.325]  What are they doing?
[00:19:18.345 --> 00:19:19.026]  What is this for?
[00:19:19.186 --> 00:19:20.807]  This is an open carry march.
[00:19:21.107 --> 00:19:24.769]  They're just openly carrying their rifles to demonstrate their rights.
[00:19:24.809 --> 00:19:28.251]  They're not so much protesting any one particular event, it's just the right they have.
[00:19:28.271 --> 00:19:29.511]  So they're just exercising their rights.
[00:19:30.012 --> 00:19:31.793]  So do you have any thoughts about that?
[00:19:31.973 --> 00:19:33.213]  I guess if it's their right.
[00:19:33.393 --> 00:19:34.854]  What do you guys think about all these guns out here?
[00:19:35.595 --> 00:19:42.218]  I don't know man, I'm from California where like, this whole thing, there'd be like tanks around this place if this was in California.
[00:19:42.238 --> 00:19:47.041]  Do you think that's a good thing that they have such a strong police presence in California for events like this?
[00:19:48.872 --> 00:19:50.614]  Um, I don't know.
[00:19:51.275 --> 00:20:05.152]  I don't have a gun and I don't shoot guns but I'm intrigued by them and they permeate our society so my point for coming down here to take a closer look is that these are just regular people like you and me and
[00:20:06.158 --> 00:20:10.059]  You know, I'm sure we can all be friends and have common ground.
[00:20:10.399 --> 00:20:13.340]  Do you wish you had guns like that in France?
[00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:13.561]  No!
[00:20:13.741 --> 00:20:14.821]  We are fine without guns.
[00:20:14.881 --> 00:20:15.801]  You're fine without guns?
[00:20:15.841 --> 00:20:16.542]  Yeah.
[00:20:16.562 --> 00:20:17.202]  We don't need them.
[00:20:17.462 --> 00:20:18.022]  What is it for?
[00:20:18.042 --> 00:20:18.742]  We don't need them.
[00:20:18.862 --> 00:20:20.843]  This is a... Well, it's not even a protest.
[00:20:20.883 --> 00:20:22.564]  These people... We just have the rights here.
[00:20:22.584 --> 00:20:29.166]  In the U.S., we have something called the Second Amendment that gives people the right to carry guns, like the people are doing here today.
[00:20:29.406 --> 00:20:29.746]  Uh-huh.
[00:20:30.606 --> 00:20:32.267]  So, do you guys think that's a good thing that we have that?
[00:20:32.287 --> 00:20:34.027]  Do you think we should get rid of the guns?
[00:20:34.047 --> 00:20:34.868]  Or what do you guys think?
[00:20:36.235 --> 00:20:38.256]  We have not the same country, so we can't judge.
[00:20:38.276 --> 00:20:40.037]  You can't judge?
[00:20:40.077 --> 00:20:40.277]  No.
[00:20:40.337 --> 00:20:41.358]  That's a respectable opinion.
[00:20:43.599 --> 00:20:48.421]  Now, coming up after this last break, I'll be talking with David Seaman about the rise of independent media.

[00:22:29.211 --> 00:22:30.693]  Our guest tonight is David Seaman.
[00:22:30.733 --> 00:22:33.475]  He's an independent journalist, broadcaster, and activist.
[00:22:33.515 --> 00:22:35.638]  He's going to be talking to us about his new morning show.
[00:22:35.658 --> 00:22:36.358]  He joins us now.
[00:22:36.699 --> 00:22:37.820]  Thank you for joining us, David.
[00:22:38.841 --> 00:22:39.281]  Thank you.
[00:22:39.882 --> 00:22:43.966]  Now, for our viewers who may not be familiar with you and what you do, can you just give us a brief introduction?
[00:22:45.387 --> 00:22:48.070]  Yeah, I am an independent journalist who covers
[00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:50.461]  Yeah, and I've seen a few of your episodes.
[00:22:50.481 --> 00:22:52.741]  You've got really good stuff on there.
[00:22:52.781 --> 00:22:57.523]  So tell us how long you've been doing the podcast and the new morning show and what people can expect.
[00:23:11.238 --> 00:23:11.438]  Sure.
[00:23:11.478 --> 00:23:14.683]  Well, the podcast on iTunes I've been doing for about a year and a half now.
[00:23:15.183 --> 00:23:21.772]  I have 146 episodes up, and that's something where I just try to go in-depth with people, sit them down, mic them up.
[00:23:22.193 --> 00:23:25.577]  You have an hour to discuss whatever topics are in the news.
[00:23:26.478 --> 00:23:36.222]  And that's really interesting, but with Rai's morning show, we're trying to create something that can be mass-produced and really compete with some of the morning shows that are out there right now.
[00:23:36.242 --> 00:23:39.403]  Things like The Today Show and CBS's morning program.
[00:23:39.763 --> 00:23:53.369]  But instead of focusing on stuff like Miley Cyrus grinding her butt into some guy at the BMAs and having experts on to talk about that, and instead of inviting on political pundits who are shrill and who defend the establishment,
[00:23:53.889 --> 00:24:07.440]  We just want to get to the bottom of really serious issues, stuff like the Fukushima radiation disaster, stuff like the NSA revelations, the fact that all of our phones are basically a form of government surveillance at this point.
[00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:19.049]  And that's what we want to do, is to create something that is really fun to watch, but actually makes you a more informed citizen, instead of just a zombie being fed this, you know, distraction infotainment.
[00:24:19.918 --> 00:24:28.986]  And I'm glad you bring that up because a lot of people, they have this notion of, well, you know, you can't really compete if you're Alternative News with what they consider to be the real official mainstream media.
[00:24:29.006 --> 00:24:34.130]  It's like, you know, this guy's never going to have, you know, a Today Show of Alternative News, InfoWars, Nightly News.
[00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:34.731]  There's never going to be...
[00:24:35.151 --> 00:24:36.573]  You know, the big night shows.
[00:24:36.633 --> 00:24:37.614]  But we disagree with that.
[00:24:37.674 --> 00:24:39.215]  Not just for ourselves, but for you as well.
[00:24:39.235 --> 00:24:41.197]  Because people are hungry for this information.
[00:24:41.217 --> 00:24:44.020]  They're tired of these old, tried-and-true formats.
[00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:47.343]  They're tired of having these celebrities talk about their new movies and stuff.
[00:24:47.363 --> 00:24:48.764]  And we have celebrities on here as well.
[00:24:49.045 --> 00:24:53.829]  But we have people to talk on real issues, real things, such as the situation in Syria.
[00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:56.071]  So, David, I know you've been researching this in depth.
[00:24:56.232 --> 00:24:59.535]  What have you come up with, and what thoughts do you have about the situation in Syria?
[00:25:00.546 --> 00:25:08.369]  Well, I think this is a country that has not attacked us, and so it's absolutely ludicrous for us to be discussing the possibility of a military strike.
[00:25:08.989 --> 00:25:13.951]  Because once you attack a country like that, you have no idea where it might end up.
[00:25:13.991 --> 00:25:20.394]  You're putting your stick in the hornet's nest and assuring people that the hornets aren't going to chase us back.
[00:25:20.894 --> 00:25:21.955]  To wherever we came from.
[00:25:21.975 --> 00:25:23.755]  I don't buy that for a second.
[00:25:24.176 --> 00:25:28.618]  And this is one of the areas, one of the many areas, where the mainstream media has failed the people.
[00:25:28.938 --> 00:25:44.806]  You know, you have these political pundits on TV, these hacks, who make a living by spreading misinformation and half-truths, and they come on TV and go, you know, I think that Secretary of State Kerry did a great job of selling the war to us.
[00:25:45.811 --> 00:25:47.292]  You're like selling the war.
[00:25:47.392 --> 00:25:48.473]  What are you talking about?
[00:25:48.493 --> 00:25:51.695]  You know, like we just are now winding down Afghanistan.
[00:25:52.076 --> 00:25:53.637]  We got out of Iraq somewhat.
[00:25:54.017 --> 00:25:57.019]  These are really expensive, disastrous policies.
[00:25:57.059 --> 00:26:00.002]  And why would we want to enter a third country in any way?
[00:26:00.322 --> 00:26:04.645]  And so you have people trying to rationalize stuff that is really completely ridiculous.
[00:26:04.685 --> 00:26:05.706]  We don't belong there.
[00:26:06.466 --> 00:26:14.973]  If America is concerned about human rights violations, why don't we look to China or North Korea or any of the other countries that hold political prisoners?
[00:26:15.373 --> 00:26:18.675]  It's ridiculous that we're even considering... Why don't we look at civil rights in our own country?
[00:26:18.715 --> 00:26:28.079]  You know, we have people being violated right here, and I'm not saying, you know, we have people right here so let's not help other countries, but we're not exactly trying to help Syria, at least not the Obama administration.
[00:26:28.359 --> 00:26:32.381]  He gets on TV every week and 80%, 90% of the Americans agree with me.
[00:26:32.421 --> 00:26:33.462]  I'm like, who are you asking?
[00:26:33.822 --> 00:26:37.744]  Are you asking 9 out of 10 people who work in the White House?
[00:26:37.804 --> 00:26:42.866]  I mean, where are you getting these numbers that the majority of Americans want to enter Syria in some type of conflict?
[00:26:42.926 --> 00:26:43.747]  I don't see that at all.
[00:26:44.784 --> 00:26:49.145]  It's a form of propaganda, and he does this on his Twitter account also.
[00:26:49.465 --> 00:27:02.969]  I say he, of course it's managed for him by somebody else, by a group of people, but they were doing this during the gun control debate where he kept tweeting out, 92% of Americans demand gun control, retweet if you agree.
[00:27:03.349 --> 00:27:07.790]  If 92% of Americans wanted that, why didn't it get passed, right?
[00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:11.011]  Like, that's just, it's a form of mind control, it's a form of
[00:27:11.791 --> 00:27:12.712]  Deception, I think.
[00:27:12.772 --> 00:27:19.156]  If you keep repeating 90% of Americans want this, 92% of Americans want this, well then why can't you get it done, right?
[00:27:19.256 --> 00:27:21.658]  He keeps saying that until people start to believe it.
[00:27:22.398 --> 00:27:24.600]  And it's one of those tried-and-true tactics.
[00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:29.003]  Now, David, our time is short, and I know you also have some things on the NSA you want to touch on.
[00:27:30.307 --> 00:27:32.188]  Yeah, I'm surprised there isn't a lot more anger.
[00:27:32.408 --> 00:27:34.609]  And this is another area where the media has failed us.
[00:27:34.629 --> 00:27:43.292]  Like Rise Morning Show is going to be covering the NSA thing non-stop because I think it's really pretty important to our future, not only as a country, but as a planet.
[00:27:43.392 --> 00:27:47.874]  The NSA, their tentacles reach into every country's internet communications.
[00:27:47.914 --> 00:27:49.415]  The internet is a global tool.
[00:27:50.015 --> 00:27:50.796]  We're good to go.
[00:28:11.088 --> 00:28:16.673]  And even there is discussion that encryption, they might have a way around encryption.
[00:28:16.693 --> 00:28:18.575]  So you don't even know if your bank accounts are safe.
[00:28:18.835 --> 00:28:20.597]  That's exactly right, David.
[00:28:20.957 --> 00:28:22.098]  They're not elected officials.
[00:28:22.398 --> 00:28:22.999]  No, not at all.
[00:28:23.339 --> 00:28:24.560]  Well, I definitely appreciate your time.
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:29.004]  David Seaman, Rise Morning Show, and hopefully to hear good things from you in the future.
[00:28:29.932 --> 00:28:34.433]  Thanks a lot for having me on, and thanks a lot for what you guys are doing over at InfoWars.
[00:28:34.593 --> 00:28:35.354]  It's a team effort.
[00:28:35.374 --> 00:28:36.434]  All right, thanks, David.
