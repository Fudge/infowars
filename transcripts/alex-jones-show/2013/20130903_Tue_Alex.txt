[00:00:00.905 --> 00:00:02.789]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:04.812]  Great Talk Radio starts here.
[00:00:12.608 --> 00:00:14.448]  Things are really developing quickly.
[00:00:37.722 --> 00:00:57.180]  And I'm going to break down every angle and facet of the situation in Syria, the establishment media and the government of the West, governments of the West trying to sell this massive fraud, the very jihadis that the West are backing tried to block the Suez Canal today.
[00:00:58.161 --> 00:01:12.027]  And they've had to send in attack helicopters to take them out and our media is criticizing the Egyptian military for basically firing rockets from helicopters into actual Al-Qaeda.
[00:01:13.748 --> 00:01:23.672]  We are living in the twilight zone and literally thousands of military men, mainly, I haven't seen any women, are holding up
[00:01:24.554 --> 00:01:25.014]  We're good to go.
[00:01:50.407 --> 00:01:53.989]  Took the information and hacked in the Marine Corps website showing the info.
[00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:58.811]  No, I've run into military on the streets in the last two weeks, twice.
[00:01:59.532 --> 00:02:02.833]  Because Austin, Texas and Central Texas is crawling with military bases.
[00:02:02.853 --> 00:02:04.894]  I mean, there's just military bases all around us.
[00:02:05.575 --> 00:02:08.656]  And they're all absolutely angry and upset about it.
[00:02:09.136 --> 00:02:11.678]  Anybody that has military family members knows this.
[00:02:11.698 --> 00:02:13.458]  I mean, this is a big deal.
[00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:17.661]  The military has been fighting these jihadis for 12 years.
[00:02:19.682 --> 00:02:20.563]  Almost 12 years.
[00:02:21.343 --> 00:02:32.389]  Overseas, and a lot of them have been wounded by them, a lot of them have been injured by them, a lot of them have lost friends to them, and they're very, very upset about it, and they know the facts.
[00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:33.570]  They know the U.S.
[00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:39.373]  military in Jordan has been training Al-Qaeda commandos for two and a half years.
[00:02:39.613 --> 00:02:42.155]  Plus, by the way, that's now mainstream news today.
[00:02:43.295 --> 00:02:44.076]  Gonna be getting to that.
[00:02:44.096 --> 00:02:45.256]  I'm not tooting our horn.
[00:02:45.617 --> 00:02:47.678]  It's just, I mean, all I do is study this stuff, okay?
[00:02:48.911 --> 00:02:52.812]  I know what I'm talking about more than pretty much anybody else you're going to hear.
[00:02:53.273 --> 00:02:56.434]  Does that mean that I get stuff wrong occasionally or get names mixed up?
[00:02:56.474 --> 00:02:56.674]  Sure.
[00:02:57.274 --> 00:03:01.956]  The world's so complex, folks, I work on this full-time and feel like I'm a complete buffoon.
[00:03:02.776 --> 00:03:07.798]  I can't imagine being a member of the general public, though, that has no idea how anything works.
[00:03:08.978 --> 00:03:10.219]  That must be really scary.
[00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:14.880]  Or I guess they say ignorance is bliss, so I guess it isn't scary.
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.041]  It's scary for me.
[00:03:18.106 --> 00:03:22.429]  To realize that people have been in the dark so much, but now the sea change happened.
[00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:31.794]  A week and a half ago, the Reuters poll, other polls, 9 to 15 percent support what they've got, depending on the poll, for this attack.
[00:03:33.015 --> 00:03:36.057]  And that's a total flip from the numbers that it was previously.
[00:03:37.392 --> 00:03:39.372]  It is a collapse of confidence in the system.
[00:03:39.652 --> 00:03:41.113]  And that's the big story here.
[00:03:41.473 --> 00:03:45.813]  Bigger than Syria, bigger than all the ramifications of that, even short term, is this.
[00:03:46.214 --> 00:03:47.494]  And we're going to go over it today.
[00:03:47.794 --> 00:04:06.117]  Paul Watson has an article up on Infowars.com dealing with the fact that a top law professor who worked in the Bush administration in authorizations for war
[00:04:07.665 --> 00:04:14.688]  Has come out and said in a law journal that Obama's Syrian attack resolution authorizes boots on the ground.
[00:04:16.007 --> 00:04:24.969]  Now, separately, there's a London Telegraph article that our story links to with a former member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff saying that they've talked to people on the Hill.
[00:04:25.309 --> 00:04:26.890]  This is a full-out invasion.
[00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:28.010]  Of course it is.
[00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:39.573]  They don't have amphibious landing ships in the Mediterranean loaded with Marines because they plan on playing a game of croquet or badminton with
[00:04:40.996 --> 00:04:41.536]  Assad.
[00:04:42.117 --> 00:04:43.817]  By the way, will you guys pull up the Weekly Standard?
[00:04:44.077 --> 00:04:47.099]  We got our own article coming out that shows five different people set up at the State Department.
[00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:50.921]  But pull up the dinner with Assad, Kerry's dinner with Assad.
[00:04:50.941 --> 00:04:51.681]  He had five of them.
[00:04:52.421 --> 00:04:53.962]  There's five separate photos we've got.
[00:04:53.982 --> 00:05:00.345]  We're doing an article with other Secretaries of State and others with people they set up right after they have the meetings with them.
[00:05:00.805 --> 00:05:01.566]  It's all coming up.
[00:05:01.626 --> 00:05:02.886]  It's a big transmission.
[00:05:03.426 --> 00:05:04.847]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:05:05.527 --> 00:05:06.328]  InfoWars.com.
[00:05:07.947 --> 00:05:11.590]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us?
[00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:17.094]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[00:05:17.334 --> 00:05:24.879]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[00:05:25.059 --> 00:05:34.166]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[00:05:34.366 --> 00:05:41.393]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[00:05:41.554 --> 00:05:44.397]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[00:05:44.417 --> 00:05:51.364]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse, but demand a war.
[00:05:53.163 --> 00:05:53.703]  Introducing Pro-1.
[00:05:53.723 --> 00:05:55.885]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on the go.
[00:05:55.905 --> 00:05:59.207]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[00:05:59.227 --> 00:06:02.149]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and
[00:06:20.362 --> 00:06:23.785]  And up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:06:23.926 --> 00:06:34.696]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.
[00:06:34.916 --> 00:06:37.599]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gates!

[00:08:17.734 --> 00:08:21.117]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:08:21.817 --> 00:08:24.660]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:30.864]  It is Tuesday, already the third day of September 2013.
[00:08:31.845 --> 00:08:33.146]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:08:33.166 --> 00:08:38.090]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours, as we are at weekdays, 11 a.m.
[00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:38.591]  to 2 p.m.
[00:08:38.631 --> 00:08:43.775]  Central, back every evening, 7 o'clock Central, with InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:08:44.977 --> 00:08:50.640]  Well, we're going to get into all the big developments with the Syria situation on so many fronts.
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:54.461]  We're also going to look at 40,000 longshoremen quit the AFL-CIO.
[00:08:59.346 --> 00:09:01.968]  Over Obamacare and the open borders.
[00:09:02.108 --> 00:09:05.631]  Finally the unions wake up that they've been completely sold out.
[00:09:05.671 --> 00:09:07.032]  We're going to be going over that.
[00:09:07.493 --> 00:09:11.977]  Russia issues travel warning to its citizens abroad to not visit the U.S.
[00:09:12.097 --> 00:09:16.720]  or countries that have extradition agreements because they say that you may just be kidnapped and disappeared.
[00:09:16.741 --> 00:09:18.842]  That's like 30 years ago.
[00:09:18.882 --> 00:09:20.343]  Don't go to Russia, you might disappear.
[00:09:21.653 --> 00:09:29.087]  Police break up drug-fueled orgy at Masonic Lodge after finding women dancing naked on stage and men filming sex acts.
[00:09:29.808 --> 00:09:31.471]  Well, that's what secret societies are for!
[00:09:33.044 --> 00:09:34.846]  I know people that have been in the Illuminati.
[00:09:35.307 --> 00:09:37.609]  Believe me, it gets a lot more serious than that.
[00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:42.254]  I mean, look what goes on at Bohemian Grove, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:42.294 --> 00:09:44.056]  So we're going to be talking about that report.
[00:09:44.717 --> 00:09:47.881]  Before I get into the serious news, I'm very excited about this.
[00:09:48.822 --> 00:09:53.727]  We're going to be having Roderick George Toombs, or Rowdy
[00:09:54.994 --> 00:09:59.517]  Piper coming on the broadcast with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:00.337 --> 00:10:15.766]  Rowdy Roddy Piper, of course, the 25th anniversary of They Live, the seminal John Carpenter film that I am a huge fan of because it absolutely gets you outside the box and is a great allegory of what's really happening.
[00:10:16.784 --> 00:10:22.051]  And waking up from the Matrix and seeing how incredibly obvious it was, how did you not see before?
[00:10:22.451 --> 00:10:28.098]  It's only the decision to look a little bit deeper and that is basically putting on the sunglasses.
[00:10:28.939 --> 00:10:33.685]  So I'm told that he is a listener of the show.
[00:10:35.433 --> 00:10:37.515]  And that he is into conspiracies and things.
[00:10:38.557 --> 00:10:39.778]  Again, putting the glasses on.
[00:10:40.259 --> 00:10:42.221]  And Sean Stone is going to be on with him.
[00:10:42.601 --> 00:10:44.483]  Frequent contributor to the broadcast.
[00:10:44.543 --> 00:10:48.187]  And I've also been involved with him with his national TV show with Ventura.
[00:10:48.828 --> 00:10:50.830]  So Sean Stone, obviously son of...
[00:10:52.284 --> 00:11:00.346]  The older father director will be joining us coming up on the broadcast.
[00:11:00.386 --> 00:11:11.349]  And I also want to ask him about his dad, Oliver Stone, getting more hardcore in Japan two weeks ago and saying Obama is a, quote, snake and we've all got to turn on him.
[00:11:11.809 --> 00:11:20.751]  So we'll play that clip as well when his son Oliver Stone, director and writer and producer in his own right, joins us as well ahead.
[00:11:21.691 --> 00:11:25.033]  of Rowdy Roddy Piper joining us.
[00:11:25.553 --> 00:11:38.419]  He grew up watching wrestling and watching Piper Saturday night or whenever it came on for entertainment purposes, but really I'm a big fan because of They Live and some of the other films that he's in.
[00:11:39.099 --> 00:11:40.360]  So that is coming up.
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.941]  We'll get his take on the world as well.
[00:11:43.441 --> 00:11:46.303]  Wayne Madsen will join us in the first 30 minutes of the next hour.
[00:11:47.844 --> 00:11:53.146]  Formerly in the Navy, in anti-submarine warfare, then in NSA internal security.
[00:11:53.926 --> 00:11:56.046]  He's really the original NSA whistleblower.
[00:11:56.206 --> 00:11:57.847]  The granddaddy of them all.
[00:11:58.607 --> 00:12:02.088]  In fact, if he did the stuff what he did 15 years ago today, he'd probably be in prison.
[00:12:02.728 --> 00:12:07.970]  But he's going to join us because he's been to Syria and he's always got his ear to the ground working up there.
[00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:13.634]  On Capitol Hill and reporting on national security matters.
[00:12:13.714 --> 00:12:18.818]  So we'll get the inside scoop with Wayne Madsen coming up.
[00:12:19.859 --> 00:12:22.601]  All right, where to start on this Syria situation?
[00:12:25.043 --> 00:12:36.071]  Not only is Syria obviously incredibly important geopolitically to energy prices, to the name of the United States, to the future of NATO, to what's happening in Israel,
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:49.463]  But it's also important that this is the first time since 1782 that the British Parliament has voted down a Prime Minister's request for authorization for war.
[00:12:51.463 --> 00:12:57.405]  It is the first time in a very long time that the Turkish Parliament, a big part of NATO, has voted down an authorization of war.
[00:12:57.785 --> 00:13:00.085]  That happened a few days ago and got almost no coverage here.
[00:13:01.166 --> 00:13:06.307]  And it is the first time in recent memory that the Congress hasn't rushed
[00:13:08.095 --> 00:13:18.024]  Uh, to signal their support without even giving official authorization under the Constitution for the President, El Jefe, the dear leader, the dear one.
[00:13:18.825 --> 00:13:21.207]  Don't criticize him, you'll get fired like the rodeo clown.
[00:13:21.768 --> 00:13:23.690]  You don't do that in the new land of the free, home of the brave.
[00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:32.438]  It's the first time that the President said, I'm going to strike, I can do it if I want to, I don't need your authorization, just like with Libya a couple years ago.
[00:13:33.402 --> 00:13:44.248]  Now saying, okay, I do have to get your authorization, but with the surrogates doubling back, Kerry, Secretary of State, saying, I can still, you know, he can still do this if Congress doesn't vote the right way.
[00:13:44.708 --> 00:13:54.893]  And we've got John Boehner, excuse me, Boehner, coming out and saying that he's going to authorize war.
[00:13:55.153 --> 00:13:56.314]  Let's get one thing straight.
[00:13:56.394 --> 00:14:00.436]  There's been war going on for two years and nine months.
[00:14:02.435 --> 00:14:22.894]  By Christmas time this year, it'll be three years that Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Turkey, and several other Middle Eastern countries, as well as NATO, with CIA commandos, MI6 commandos,
[00:14:24.408 --> 00:14:27.191]  Uh, French commandos are one of the biggest forces there.
[00:14:27.532 --> 00:14:28.373]  Truly disgusting.
[00:14:28.393 --> 00:14:31.156]  Uh, that they always claim they're anti-war and that they're part of this.
[00:14:31.536 --> 00:14:33.798]  I guess it's one country ganged up on by all these people.
[00:14:34.039 --> 00:14:35.941]  By the way, the French folks are very angry about it.
[00:14:36.281 --> 00:14:38.363]  They're almost 90% in polls against it as well.
[00:14:38.804 --> 00:14:45.210]  But the socialist president, in trouble for all his scandals, copped the Swiss bank accounts with him and his party, exempt from taxes.
[00:14:46.192 --> 00:14:49.275]  Basically when they raise a 100% plus tax on the middle class.
[00:14:49.695 --> 00:14:50.336]  I'm not joking.
[00:14:50.997 --> 00:14:56.803]  A 100% plus tax to absolutely bankrupt all their conservative and libertarian enemies.
[00:14:57.224 --> 00:14:58.545]  To extinct them in the country.
[00:14:58.946 --> 00:15:00.447]  The power to tax, the power to destroy.
[00:15:00.728 --> 00:15:01.669]  He wants a diversion.
[00:15:01.949 --> 00:15:03.351]  Obama wants a bigger diversion.
[00:15:03.511 --> 00:15:06.094]  There's a lot of factors at play here.
[00:15:07.619 --> 00:15:13.987]  There are a lot of groups that can say, well, let's blame Israel, or let's blame France, or let's blame America, or let's blame NATO.
[00:15:14.487 --> 00:15:18.693]  You get wars when a whole bunch of different
[00:15:21.664 --> 00:15:34.230]  Factions of the Western power structure line up when the stars align with Mars, basically, to use a astrology analogy that would make Nancy Reagan happy.
[00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:38.312]  Or you could use an astronomical as well, I mean more scientific.
[00:15:38.592 --> 00:15:43.454]  When the stars align in the house of Mars, you get big hot wars.
[00:15:43.494 --> 00:15:44.475]  But let's get this straight.
[00:15:45.993 --> 00:15:47.295]  It's come out in the foreign press.
[00:15:47.456 --> 00:15:51.322]  I have military sources who two years ago told me they were
[00:15:52.569 --> 00:16:04.758]  Considering retiring early out of the military, people that have been over 20 years, and leaving the United States because they're so disgusted and freaked out by the open training to take on the American people, that's now all public.
[00:16:05.218 --> 00:16:17.927]  The FEMA camps, the gun confiscation, the armored vehicles, the bullets, the Army Times, Stars and Stripes, all admitting the preparations for war domestically against libertarians, returning veterans, gun owners, Christians,
[00:16:19.178 --> 00:16:20.739]  This is all now passe.
[00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:21.620]  It's all over the news.
[00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:23.162]  Well, of course we're training to take you on.
[00:16:23.182 --> 00:16:24.203]  You're the main terror threat.
[00:16:24.823 --> 00:16:27.946]  They're just normalizing it ahead of actually trying to do it.
[00:16:28.246 --> 00:16:30.689]  When they finally... They build this stuff in secret.
[00:16:30.949 --> 00:16:31.890]  They train in secret.
[00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:33.872]  But then when they start openly announcing it...
[00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:38.811]  You're on the news saying we'll arrest you if you talk bad about Obama.
[00:16:39.191 --> 00:16:40.191]  We've played those news clips.
[00:16:40.631 --> 00:16:41.351]  The truth squads.
[00:16:41.711 --> 00:16:54.194]  That's when they're really trying to acclimate and hide it in plain view so the police and military and others and judges all kind of follow the herd, the tyrannical train here.
[00:16:54.634 --> 00:16:57.155]  They all get hooked up to it and just play ball.
[00:16:57.595 --> 00:16:58.695]  The message is going out.
[00:16:58.995 --> 00:17:02.336]  It's also a form of intimidation that, yeah, okay, we are
[00:17:03.598 --> 00:17:05.478]  We are training to put you in camps.
[00:17:05.518 --> 00:17:06.859]  We are training to take your guns.
[00:17:07.379 --> 00:17:08.179]  What are you going to do about it?
[00:17:09.499 --> 00:17:11.940]  So the military is all completely freaking out about this.
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:14.041]  And they're also freaked out.
[00:17:14.461 --> 00:17:31.645]  The cherry on top is that at bases in Jordan, in bases in Iraq, I forgot Iraq, and Turkey, and all over surrounding this poor country, Syria, they are injecting jihadis who shoot up convoys of cars on the highway.
[00:17:32.739 --> 00:17:34.821]  Because if you haven't joined them, they kill you.
[00:17:35.401 --> 00:17:38.544]  They killed 40-something men, women, and children just today.
[00:17:39.365 --> 00:17:40.726]  And then pose with the dead bodies.
[00:17:41.847 --> 00:17:44.970]  They're attacking the Suez Canal and military bases in Egypt.
[00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:50.835]  When the Egyptian military fights back, our media says, how dare them attack protesters and activists.
[00:17:52.112 --> 00:17:59.056]  Our crazy, banker-run, globalist-controlled government is publicly funding jihadis worldwide.
[00:17:59.356 --> 00:18:13.024]  And the military, many of them that have lost hearing, lost loved ones, lost fingers, toes, legs, arms, they are just absolutely seething.
[00:18:16.005 --> 00:18:18.507]  It is just amazing that this is going on.
[00:18:18.587 --> 00:18:20.488]  So they're freaking out right now.
[00:18:22.387 --> 00:18:24.809]  And when we come back, I'm going to break all of this down.
[00:18:25.729 --> 00:18:33.795]  Obama's Syria attack resolution authorizes boots on the ground.
[00:18:35.236 --> 00:18:48.325]  Planned for military intervention greases skids for war throughout the region, says Harvard professor, law school professor Jack Goldsmith, for the law journal Lawfare.
[00:18:49.494 --> 00:18:54.798]  And he worked at the Pentagon and the Bush administration in war authorization.
[00:18:55.819 --> 00:18:59.161]  And he says this is authorization to invade the entire Middle East.
[00:18:59.221 --> 00:19:00.742]  Now, that's not just him saying it.
[00:19:01.283 --> 00:19:07.727]  Here is the London Telegraph, also linked up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:19:08.187 --> 00:19:08.468]  U.S.
[00:19:08.608 --> 00:19:13.071]  General says action could be more substantial than thought.
[00:19:13.451 --> 00:19:14.072]  Former U.S.
[00:19:14.192 --> 00:19:15.553]  Army Chief, one of the chairmen of the
[00:19:16.073 --> 00:19:16.193]  Really?
[00:19:16.213 --> 00:19:16.613]  He's claiming that?
[00:19:34.724 --> 00:19:37.548]  In the last week, that he wants congressional cover.
[00:19:37.908 --> 00:19:39.150]  He isn't claiming this.
[00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:40.372]  It's absolute fact.
[00:19:40.992 --> 00:19:41.794]  Now, it goes on.
[00:19:42.054 --> 00:19:43.135]  Here's Obama again.
[00:19:43.836 --> 00:19:44.617]  London Telegraph.
[00:19:44.938 --> 00:19:49.224]  First Syrian rebels armed and trained by CIA on the way to the battlefield.
[00:19:49.244 --> 00:19:52.228]  See, they're now announcing a two and a half year admitted program.
[00:19:53.427 --> 00:19:54.868]  To the American people and the Brits.
[00:19:55.729 --> 00:20:05.499]  It said Mr. Obama said a 50-man cell, believed to have been trained by US Special Forces in Jordan, was making its way across the border into Syria, according to the New York Times.
[00:20:08.305 --> 00:20:09.525]  Don't throw away leftovers.
[00:20:09.865 --> 00:20:15.647]  Instead, throw all your leftovers, vegetable peels, eggshells, coffee grounds, pizza crusts, and more into the Bokashi!

[00:21:08.228 --> 00:21:10.309]  It's hurricane and wildfire season again.
[00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:17.935]  Why do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year, betting their lives that the disaster won't get them?
[00:21:18.355 --> 00:21:23.018]  Hundreds of you helped eFoodsDirect ship 50,000 donated meals to the Oklahoma victims.
[00:21:23.298 --> 00:21:25.180]  The problem is we can't help everybody.
[00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:31.584]  If every one of us who can will take care of ourselves, we can all pitch in to take care of those who really can't.
[00:21:31.864 --> 00:21:39.689]  The new Just In Case Pack from eFoods Direct is the big brother to the 7-Day Emergency Pack designed for Oklahoma disaster donations.

[00:22:38.098 --> 00:22:42.401]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:22:42.581 --> 00:22:48.184]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:22:48.284 --> 00:22:50.386]  Gold has outperformed paper investments yet.
[00:22:50.466 --> 00:22:51.626]  No word about IRAs.
[00:22:51.867 --> 00:22:54.428]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[00:23:06.696 --> 00:23:11.577]  There are those curious about bitcoins and those using and making money with bitcoins.
[00:23:12.057 --> 00:23:13.237]  What are bitcoins?
[00:23:13.698 --> 00:23:19.759]  A bitcoin is the first decentralized currency that can be easily transferred from person to person over the internet.
[00:23:20.179 --> 00:23:21.599]  No bank needed.
[00:23:21.999 --> 00:23:27.280]  This means lower fees and accounts can never be frozen, limited or closed.

[00:24:04.205 --> 00:24:05.727]  We mine your business.
[00:24:25.609 --> 00:24:27.991]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[00:24:30.072 --> 00:24:30.813]  Thanks for joining us.
[00:24:31.634 --> 00:24:37.218]  I want to give the number out again for active duty military personnel to call in.
[00:24:37.278 --> 00:24:51.409]  There are literally hundreds and hundreds earlier in the weekend, now thousands, so many we can't track them, of military personnel, mainly officers, non-commissioned, but also I see some of the photos are colonels and captains and others.
[00:24:53.109 --> 00:25:01.352]  Wearing the uniforms but covering up their face with a piece of paper saying I didn't join the army to fight for Al-Qaeda in a Syrian civil war.
[00:25:02.433 --> 00:25:05.414]  And you know to call it a civil war is not even really accurate.
[00:25:06.254 --> 00:25:14.617]  The Assad father was brutal and did crush some of the Sunni radicals that were openly trying to take over the country.
[00:25:16.498 --> 00:25:17.938]  And I don't want to live in Syria.
[00:25:17.958 --> 00:25:20.719]  I don't live in the Middle East.
[00:25:21.159 --> 00:25:22.200]  I don't have a dog in this fight.
[00:25:23.612 --> 00:25:43.659]  But his son was democratizing, opening things up, had dinner with Kerry five times, was hanging out with the West, was trying to make deals with Israel, and now they have used the fact that they opened their country up in almost the last three years, two years, nine months, to inject all these forces into the country.
[00:25:43.999 --> 00:25:51.722]  Now, if you go up to InfoWars.com, there's an article up there dealing with Assad's meeting with Kerry,
[00:25:56.417 --> 00:26:03.645]  One of five that he had, but if you scroll down to the article, we have Gaddafi and Saddam and others meeting with
[00:26:04.617 --> 00:26:10.379]  Obama and Rumsfeld and all the rest of them, and how they always sucker these people in.
[00:26:11.119 --> 00:26:17.801]  They got Qaddafi eight years ago to invest most of his money with the West, to open up all the investment, to let Western governments come in.
[00:26:18.261 --> 00:26:22.722]  He said, oh, I like Bush now, oh, I like Obama now, they're my friends.
[00:26:23.182 --> 00:26:26.523]  And they used that to absolutely sucker him.
[00:26:27.103 --> 00:26:33.325]  In fact, it's come out that Tony Blair and Sarkozy actually got a lot of the investment money directly from Qaddafi.
[00:26:33.945 --> 00:26:36.046]  And then their answer was to set him up and kill him.
[00:26:36.066 --> 00:26:39.248]  And then you could say, well, Gaddafi's a bad guy.
[00:26:39.528 --> 00:26:39.788]  Really?
[00:26:39.828 --> 00:26:40.729]  Compared to Al-Qaeda?
[00:26:40.749 --> 00:26:46.072]  I mean, they claim he blew up an airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland.
[00:26:46.112 --> 00:26:47.432]  Turned out that really wasn't true.
[00:26:49.393 --> 00:26:52.155]  Early on, yeah, he did try to fund rebel groups in the Middle East.
[00:26:53.934 --> 00:26:55.115]  I don't live in North Africa.
[00:26:55.875 --> 00:27:01.458]  But the point is, compared to the jihadis who are destabilizing everything, he's a great guy.
[00:27:01.798 --> 00:27:04.199]  Just like Assad could be compared to them a great guy.
[00:27:04.239 --> 00:27:07.561]  It's like, you know, saying Nixon's a great guy compared to Hitler.
[00:27:08.641 --> 00:27:11.303]  Or Jimmy Carter's a great guy compared to Stalin.
[00:27:11.583 --> 00:27:13.984]  I mean, it doesn't mean I want to be under Nixon or Jimmy Carter either.
[00:27:16.212 --> 00:27:20.939]  And so you've got all this going on, and the military comes out and says, we don't like this.
[00:27:20.979 --> 00:27:22.060]  And they're on record saying it.
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:27.748]  You've had Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, say last year and this year, don't attack Syria.
[00:27:28.049 --> 00:27:29.971]  It could start a wider war that could lead to World War III.
[00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:31.940]  I don't know.
[00:27:50.362 --> 00:28:05.294]  Electronic Army, which is really a bunch of hackers worldwide, it's not even the Syrians, people that are upset seeing this country get ganged up on, they took the photos and kind of put it out as a tongue-in-cheek saying, Marines, Army, join the Syrian military against Al Qaeda.
[00:28:06.895 --> 00:28:16.984]  And so the only truth in it is, is that the Marine website, the Marine Corps website was hacked yesterday, or I guess Saturday, no, no, no, it'll be Sunday now, but then Monday the news broke.
[00:28:17.764 --> 00:28:19.726]  Hacked with that information,
[00:28:22.793 --> 00:28:25.475]  But this is real military that's against this.
[00:28:25.515 --> 00:28:31.540]  So I thought we'd open the phones up for active duty, or folks that have just recently got out, your take on this.
[00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:47.993]  I know you can't talk about it because it's classified, but now it's not classified because Obama is telling Senators Graham and McCain and others, don't worry, I'm sending in the first teams of CIA-trained jihadis.
[00:28:48.313 --> 00:28:49.354]  These are not the first teams.
[00:28:49.694 --> 00:28:50.275]  They have sent
[00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:52.980]  Over 150,000.
[00:28:54.021 --> 00:28:58.044]  Some numbers are higher than that in the last two and a half years of the country.
[00:28:58.865 --> 00:29:00.286]  And where did I tell you they were mainly coming out of?
[00:29:00.406 --> 00:29:00.847]  Jordan.
[00:29:01.547 --> 00:29:01.968]  Jordan.
[00:29:02.688 --> 00:29:02.948]  The U.S.
[00:29:02.988 --> 00:29:08.072]  military increased its forces there a few months ago with a drill, an exercise, and never left.
[00:29:09.173 --> 00:29:14.978]  Mr. Obama said a 50-man cell, this is from the New York Times, believed to have been trained by U.S.
[00:29:14.998 --> 00:29:20.042]  Special Forces in Jordan, was making its way across the border into Syria, according to the New York Times.
[00:29:20.342 --> 00:29:20.963]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:29:22.529 --> 00:29:34.678]  I thought you were told, and that we were all told, that it was only going to be some limited bombing, there was no boots on the ground, because of a chemical attack to help protesters who were chemical attacked.
[00:29:34.898 --> 00:29:35.879]  They're not protesters.
[00:29:35.919 --> 00:29:38.141]  See, it's all a giant lie.
[00:29:38.561 --> 00:29:44.546]  They've had special forces training Al-Qaeda and others for years.
[00:29:45.854 --> 00:29:56.467]  Ladies and gentlemen, years and years, and now they just want to make the war public to sell you on an open air bombardment.
[00:29:57.248 --> 00:30:00.232]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.

[00:31:24.941 --> 00:31:29.264]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[00:31:29.625 --> 00:31:33.567]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[00:31:33.847 --> 00:31:36.109]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[00:31:36.389 --> 00:31:42.315]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[00:33:19.271 --> 00:33:22.279]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:33:22.861 --> 00:33:27.033]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:38.038 --> 00:33:44.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live and I again want to give the number out for active, current, serving military.
[00:33:45.141 --> 00:33:52.324]  Obama is now bragging of what a tough guy he is, that he doesn't need congressional authorization even though he admits he wants it.
[00:33:53.530 --> 00:33:54.491]  The truth is under law.
[00:33:54.531 --> 00:33:55.171]  He does need it.
[00:33:55.631 --> 00:34:00.174]  They've always been attacking, in the last two and a half years, Syria.
[00:34:00.534 --> 00:34:02.676]  They now just want to escalate the whole war.
[00:34:03.296 --> 00:34:06.158]  And so now Obama wants to look like he can pull the punches.
[00:34:06.978 --> 00:34:08.399]  You know, he can throw the punches.
[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:11.962]  He can do whatever he wants, regardless of what Congress does.
[00:34:12.322 --> 00:34:19.286]  So he's bragging about the CIA and the commandos they're sending in.
[00:34:19.346 --> 00:34:20.347]  Well, that's what they have.
[00:34:20.387 --> 00:34:21.147]  They have CIA,
[00:34:22.288 --> 00:34:24.950]  Sheep-dipped former special forces is what they are.
[00:34:25.831 --> 00:34:28.053]  Most of them contractors, so they get killed.
[00:34:28.433 --> 00:34:29.754]  They can deny they were ever there.
[00:34:30.575 --> 00:34:33.578]  And they send them in to
[00:34:37.114 --> 00:34:42.238]  Syria to engage in every form of mass murder you can imagine.
[00:34:42.619 --> 00:34:59.392]  Blowing up churches, poisoning water supplies, shooting up convoys of cars driving down highways, lazing military targets so they can be fired upon with different types of ground-to-ground missiles, ground-to-air missiles.
[00:35:00.093 --> 00:35:02.515]  It is just an orgy of jihadi behavior.
[00:35:03.925 --> 00:35:07.784]  I know we've talked a lot about that, but now the Pentagon...
[00:35:09.938 --> 00:35:37.554]  uh... is uh... coming out and basically uh... now saying that they do think it can be uh... successful uh... in an air bombardment of Assad because they're being ordered to say that by the people that control Obama so I want to get your take out there if you're active duty uh... what do you think of the story we have up on Infowars.com where the news media
[00:35:38.726 --> 00:35:45.071]  And the White House is saying that none of the military is upset about fighting with Al-Qaeda, that it's all a hoax.
[00:35:45.651 --> 00:35:50.695]  Even though many of these people that are posting their photos, active duty people,
[00:35:52.608 --> 00:36:04.478]  that are posting photos with whiteboards in front of their faces saying I joined the military to fight for my country's freedom, not to support Al-Qaeda in a Syrian civil war.
[00:36:04.978 --> 00:36:07.921]  I serve America and all its people, not terrorists.
[00:36:08.261 --> 00:36:09.542]  Please wake up, America.
[00:36:10.083 --> 00:36:15.948]  By the way, a lot of these people are posting it to their official Facebooks and to their official Twitters.
[00:36:17.637 --> 00:36:46.172]  And if you go to Real Alex Jones on Twitter, we've put up a link with the hashtag so that you can tweet at Real Alex Jones your photos and your statements of where you stand on ganging up with the whole West against one little country to go in and commit absolute mass murder and to put the country under Sharia law
[00:36:47.094 --> 00:36:48.475]  And to persecute Christians.
[00:36:48.495 --> 00:36:51.317]  I mean, this is really incredible.
[00:36:51.878 --> 00:37:08.931]  And to see Lindsey Graham and other neocons out there cheerleading this and giving Obama right cover, prodding him, saying, how dare you don't take action against Assad when he gassed his own people, when it's been admitted they can't prove Assad did it.
[00:37:09.572 --> 00:37:15.376]  And Pat Buchanan and Ron Paul and Rand Paul and yours truly and countless others have said
[00:37:16.414 --> 00:37:18.255]  There's video of the rebels firing it.
[00:37:18.295 --> 00:37:20.096]  The rebels have done it before and been caught.
[00:37:20.436 --> 00:37:28.981]  It's in the Turkish news that's anti-Syria, anti-Assad, going back six months ago in the big Turkish newspapers.
[00:37:29.021 --> 00:37:30.222]  I've got it here on the stack.
[00:37:30.242 --> 00:37:31.022]  I'm going to go over it.
[00:37:32.583 --> 00:37:34.484]  It's in the Turkish news.
[00:37:37.552 --> 00:37:45.834]  That they caught Syrian rebels, Al-Qaeda rebels, sneaking back into Turkey with chemical weapons six months ago.
[00:37:46.314 --> 00:37:47.174]  What, in February?
[00:37:48.274 --> 00:37:49.374]  Almost seven months ago.
[00:37:49.394 --> 00:38:00.016]  I mean, anybody who actually studies just even mainstream media, because this stuff's all buried in the news, knows about this.
[00:38:00.596 --> 00:38:04.717]  Even the controlled press can't hide this stuff, they just try to say it's no big deal.
[00:38:06.801 --> 00:38:10.783]  So the issue is the whole false flag narrative has imploded.
[00:38:10.983 --> 00:38:12.864]  And they may even go ahead with the bombardment.
[00:38:13.104 --> 00:38:16.225]  They may be able in another six months to actually kick Assad out.
[00:38:19.446 --> 00:38:29.731]  But what are they going to do then when the world watches Al Qaeda put the country under Sharia law, sexually mutilate all the young girls, kick the women out of college, put burqas on their heads?
[00:38:32.472 --> 00:38:39.998]  What is the world going to do in two years if the West is able to kick Assad out when we're having to bomb the Al Qaeda who was put in?
[00:38:40.359 --> 00:38:46.404]  It's then time to have indictments of Obama and the other war criminals that did this.
[00:38:46.864 --> 00:38:48.025]  This is a war crime.
[00:38:48.285 --> 00:38:53.970]  This is starting a proxy war in a country that's done nothing to anybody, lying about it.
[00:38:55.872 --> 00:38:56.252]  There it is.
[00:38:56.352 --> 00:39:00.496]  Syrian rebels were caught sneaking sarin gas across the border in May.
[00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:02.781]  That was another K710.
[00:39:03.282 --> 00:39:05.766]  If you actually click on the article, it goes to the Turkish newspaper.
[00:39:06.246 --> 00:39:08.149]  I have the Turkish newspaper here in my stack.
[00:39:08.249 --> 00:39:09.791]  I'll dig it out here in a moment.
[00:39:12.195 --> 00:39:16.301]  It's just, this is so mind-blowing to see this going on.
[00:39:17.287 --> 00:39:18.528]  And so I want to hear from the military.
[00:39:18.828 --> 00:39:19.888]  Here's the toll-free number 800-259-9231.
[00:39:19.908 --> 00:39:20.028]  800-259-9231.
[00:39:20.048 --> 00:39:22.109]  And we will get you up and on the air.
[00:39:22.129 --> 00:39:22.169]  800-259-9231.
[00:39:36.414 --> 00:39:45.204]  And again, you can also tweet your photos, your comments, where you stand, to real Alex Jones, at real Alex Jones.
[00:39:45.405 --> 00:39:56.278]  And we'll also dig up and show on screen the hashtag from earlier today, where there it is, calling on all active duty military to tweet
[00:39:58.291 --> 00:40:06.498]  Hashtag, I didn't join images to at real Alex Jones to oppose Obama's attack on Syria.
[00:40:07.279 --> 00:40:08.900]  And we've opened the phones up to Israelis.
[00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:14.225]  They've called in and said, yeah, we know that the Assad regime doesn't really like us, but they're not attacking us.
[00:40:14.245 --> 00:40:17.188]  I mean, we know these Al Qaeda people hate us even more.
[00:40:17.208 --> 00:40:19.330]  Yeah, this is a bad idea.
[00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:25.135]  Then some of the media tries to spin that you're anti-Israel if you don't want to take down Assad.
[00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:27.981]  I'm not anti-Israel.
[00:40:28.061 --> 00:40:35.966]  I get criticized more than probably anybody else by all the Israel haters for not being anti-Israel.
[00:40:36.026 --> 00:40:45.391]  But I don't support corrupt elements in Israel that are doing bad things, just like I don't support corrupt elements in France or Japan or China or England.
[00:40:46.472 --> 00:40:48.653]  I want to be above it.
[00:40:50.014 --> 00:40:52.236]  I want to be able to
[00:40:54.430 --> 00:41:07.175]  Show how geopolitically the globalists are playing all these groups off against each other to bring nations into further debt, to create more crises, so they can bring in a global police state as the supposed answer.
[00:41:07.195 --> 00:41:08.155]  800-259-9231.
[00:41:08.175 --> 00:41:20.260]  But the bottom line here is the jig is up, the facade is dropping, the blinders are coming off people, the scales are being lifted.
[00:41:22.096 --> 00:41:23.276]  The train left the station.
[00:41:23.296 --> 00:41:24.397]  The genie's out of the bottle.
[00:41:25.797 --> 00:41:29.398]  The people of the world, more and more, are awake and aware.
[00:41:29.698 --> 00:41:35.200]  As Brzezinski said two years ago to the CFR on TV, he said, the people are awake.
[00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:40.182]  He wrote in his book that came out this year, you can pull up the quote, where he said,
[00:41:41.434 --> 00:41:46.476]  In the past, it was easier to spend a million dollars to propagandize a group of people.
[00:41:47.096 --> 00:41:50.978]  Now it's just cheaper to kill a million people than to propagandize a million people.
[00:41:51.258 --> 00:41:51.978]  I'm paraphrasing.
[00:41:51.998 --> 00:41:57.481]  Can you guys pull up Brzezinski's quote on, it's cheaper to kill a million people, and I'll give the actual quote.
[00:41:57.841 --> 00:41:58.961]  He wrote this in his book.
[00:41:59.001 --> 00:41:59.622]  I went and bought it.
[00:41:59.642 --> 00:42:01.222]  I actually scanned it.
[00:42:01.242 --> 00:42:01.862]  I didn't read it all.
[00:42:01.942 --> 00:42:02.863]  I went to the
[00:42:04.158 --> 00:42:08.760]  Went to the bibliography and then probably read 50 pages out of it, just to check the quotes I saw online.
[00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:15.402]  And he was talking, I think it was like the five major threats that the world faces, I forget the name of it.
[00:42:16.543 --> 00:42:29.128]  But the point is, is that when I went to buy it, there was a guy in Barnes & Noble who had it pulled out reading it, looked like a retired CIA type guy, thought he was real smart, thought he was cooler than everybody else.
[00:42:30.288 --> 00:42:30.649]  I don't know.
[00:42:45.287 --> 00:42:49.130]  To fund Pol Pot so that he could kill 30% of the population.
[00:42:50.311 --> 00:42:54.274]  And he also admits he's created Al Qaeda and Divide and Conquer.
[00:42:54.294 --> 00:42:55.975]  And the guy was like, well, so what?
[00:42:56.015 --> 00:42:57.196]  That's how you get things done.
[00:42:57.216 --> 00:42:58.797]  I went, whatever, buddy.
[00:42:59.218 --> 00:43:00.338]  You're not on the winning team.
[00:43:00.639 --> 00:43:02.620]  You're just being used as well and laughed at him.
[00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:06.223]  He wasn't laughing anymore when I left, let me tell you.
[00:43:06.603 --> 00:43:08.645]  But anyways, I just remembered that story.
[00:43:10.205 --> 00:43:16.131]  You don't often walk into a store and find where the books are in the public affairs or political science section.
[00:43:16.151 --> 00:43:17.832]  You go over there and there it is.
[00:43:18.113 --> 00:43:23.998]  To put it bluntly, in earlier times, it was easier to control 1 million people than to physically kill 1 million people.
[00:43:24.038 --> 00:43:29.564]  Today, it is infinitely easier to kill 1 million people than to control 1 million people.
[00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:34.284]  Zbigniew Brzezinski from his new bookie-wookie.
[00:43:34.564 --> 00:43:36.507]  The point is, is that he's upset.
[00:43:36.867 --> 00:43:45.298]  He came out last week on Thursday and said, quote, the alternative media is absolutely derailing our operations in Syria.
[00:43:47.014 --> 00:43:49.555]  And that we're not doing this now anymore in the dark.
[00:43:49.915 --> 00:43:51.036]  Everyone's watching us.
[00:43:51.856 --> 00:44:05.702]  As soon as the public figures out how exciting it is to become aware of geopolitical systems and how the world works and all the different factoids and all the players, now you're not concerned about the Dallas Cowboys versus the Pittsburgh Steelers.
[00:44:06.122 --> 00:44:09.504]  You're not worried about the Miami Heat versus the L.A.
[00:44:09.564 --> 00:44:10.004]  Lakers.
[00:44:10.344 --> 00:44:14.206]  You're not worried about how many pounds
[00:44:15.146 --> 00:44:18.367]  Uh, some movie star has lost or who her new boyfriend is.
[00:44:19.407 --> 00:44:22.588]  It's like a joke once you wake up to eat people even care about that stuff.
[00:44:23.348 --> 00:44:28.770]  It's only useful to interview celebrities to then reach out to their fan base who were in the Matrix.
[00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:33.711]  And then they're already interesting celebrities because they're awake, so it's fun to talk to them.
[00:44:36.328 --> 00:44:38.729]  But other than that, it means nothing.
[00:44:39.269 --> 00:44:39.849]  It means nothing.
[00:44:40.449 --> 00:45:05.595]  The minute people learn how to, instead of learning baseball scores, to learn about different mortar delivery systems, or different nanotech microplasms being put in the vaccines, or once you get into studying what the technocrats study, but from the perspective of liberty, you will never care about LeBron James again, I will assure you.
[00:45:06.787 --> 00:45:08.988]  You won't be able to help yourself.
[00:45:09.308 --> 00:45:16.450]  I mean, I can go to a party where there's a football game on and kind of get into the game if it's a good game, close, and yeah, hey, the team's winning.
[00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:24.072]  I mean, but it's still like I've dressed up in a Batman cape and I'm playing Batman and Robin with my son when he was five.
[00:45:24.772 --> 00:45:25.492]  I mean, I did that.
[00:45:25.633 --> 00:45:29.214]  I ran around the yard, ran around the houses, Batman with my kids chasing me.
[00:45:29.434 --> 00:45:34.035]  But you still feel a little goofy when the neighbor looks over and you wave at him and you're in a Batman outfit.
[00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:37.243]  You know, I put on a cape and a Batman outfit.
[00:45:38.125 --> 00:45:39.947]  And the neighbor's like, you know, hi Bob, how you doing?
[00:45:39.967 --> 00:45:42.050]  It's like, hey, Alex, how you doing?
[00:45:42.371 --> 00:45:44.995]  I'm playing with playing with playing with Rex here.
[00:45:45.015 --> 00:45:48.360]  I mean, I can go watch a football game, but it's kind of like.
[00:45:49.551 --> 00:45:51.692]  Go through the checkpoint, have them grab your scrotum.
[00:45:52.252 --> 00:45:54.333]  You know, go in, everybody watching you.
[00:45:54.753 --> 00:45:57.474]  Watching how pathetic everybody is with glassy looks in their eyes.
[00:45:58.014 --> 00:46:03.917]  Their whole tribalism that's meant to defend their family and their culture, now shunted off into this whole sick game.
[00:46:04.217 --> 00:46:05.377]  I said I'd go to your calls, didn't I?
[00:46:05.717 --> 00:46:08.999]  We're gonna go to Dan, Tyler, Doc, and others.
[00:46:10.151 --> 00:46:16.374]  Who are active duty military and inactive reserve and others who want to give us their take.
[00:46:16.394 --> 00:46:18.234]  But let me just briefly give you some of the headlines.
[00:46:18.555 --> 00:46:19.695]  Document Cam, please.
[00:46:21.256 --> 00:46:21.576]  U.S.
[00:46:21.656 --> 00:46:24.697]  General says Syria action could be more substantial than thought.
[00:46:24.857 --> 00:46:25.618]  Gee, really?
[00:46:26.038 --> 00:46:27.458]  It's always been to topple the regime.
[00:46:27.739 --> 00:46:29.980]  Obama's lying when he says it's to stop chemical weapons.
[00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:31.260]  I mean, how ridiculous?
[00:46:32.461 --> 00:46:35.262]  It's just totally illegal to go do this preemptively, so they lie.
[00:46:36.164 --> 00:46:37.485]  And of course they know they're lying.
[00:46:37.926 --> 00:46:40.408]  They know they're lying to you and everyone in the military knows it's a lie.
[00:46:40.768 --> 00:46:42.129]  They treat you like you're total idiots.
[00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:46.093]  Obama's Syria attack resolution authorizes boots on the ground.
[00:46:46.153 --> 00:46:46.473]  Boom.
[00:46:47.774 --> 00:46:51.157]  First Syrian rebels armed and trained by CIA on the way to the battlefield.
[00:46:51.818 --> 00:46:53.179]  Bush administration lawyer.
[00:46:54.099 --> 00:46:57.923]  Obama is asking Congress for authority to attack anyone on earth forever.
[00:47:00.009 --> 00:47:01.829]  Israel claims joint U.S.
[00:47:01.869 --> 00:47:04.590]  missile launch in Mediterranean for target practice.
[00:47:04.670 --> 00:47:06.931]  No, it was unannounced to trick the Russians.
[00:47:06.971 --> 00:47:09.371]  They wanted somebody to fire their own missiles.
[00:47:10.051 --> 00:47:11.091]  They're not playing games, folks.
[00:47:11.111 --> 00:47:11.852]  They want a big war.
[00:47:11.892 --> 00:47:12.492]  They want it now.
[00:47:12.852 --> 00:47:15.172]  They just don't want to get in trouble later for starting it.
[00:47:15.192 --> 00:47:20.734]  And that's what the top former member of the Joint Chiefs is saying about Obama right now in the New York Times.
[00:47:21.314 --> 00:47:25.375]  Twitter flooded with active duty military and veterans opposing attack on Syria.
[00:47:25.415 --> 00:47:26.755]  That's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:47:27.495 --> 00:47:30.259]  MSM claims military revolt against Obama a hoax.
[00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:34.365]  Watson's article proves these are real people on their official Facebooks.
[00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:37.931]  Continuing.
[00:47:39.724 --> 00:47:45.267]  Politicians enrage that Britain gave export license to sell Syrian nerve gas chemicals.
[00:47:45.687 --> 00:47:51.270]  Turns out the nerve gas chemicals were fluoride used in industrial purposes.
[00:47:51.550 --> 00:47:52.910]  The same stuff they put in our water.
[00:47:53.231 --> 00:47:55.412]  Mike Adams has an article at naturalnews.com.
[00:47:55.632 --> 00:47:59.073]  It's up on infowards.com with photos of what they shipped them.
[00:47:59.634 --> 00:48:01.435]  Here's another one with the Independent hyping it.
[00:48:01.735 --> 00:48:06.077]  Revealed UK government let British company export nerve gas chemicals to Syria.
[00:48:07.483 --> 00:48:10.024]  That's like saying water is an ingredient in beer.
[00:48:10.104 --> 00:48:13.985]  If you gave kids a glass of water, you were giving them beer.
[00:48:14.205 --> 00:48:15.265]  It's just ridiculous.
[00:48:16.165 --> 00:48:19.546]  But it is a chemical weapon, and the final equation that they put in our water.
[00:48:20.886 --> 00:48:22.847]  Al Qaeda militants killed 24 civilians.
[00:48:24.607 --> 00:48:26.668]  Machine gunned their vehicles, and now the number's up to 40.
[00:48:27.828 --> 00:48:30.009]  Syria and geopolitics of oil.
[00:48:30.449 --> 00:48:34.390]  How will rising tensions in the Middle East impact the global energy market?
[00:48:35.731 --> 00:48:38.097]  And it just goes on and on and on.
[00:48:38.558 --> 00:48:44.693]  Bashar has come out and said, hey, show me the evidence I launched the chemical attack, because I didn't.
[00:48:45.558 --> 00:48:45.938]  Here it is.
[00:48:45.998 --> 00:48:47.539]  Bashar does an interview.
[00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:49.741]  Show me proof of regime chemical attack.
[00:48:49.801 --> 00:48:52.923]  And finally, then I'm going to your calls, this little stack of news.
[00:48:53.284 --> 00:48:57.867]  Suez Canal Authority says attack attempted on container ship.
[00:48:58.407 --> 00:48:59.868]  They tried to blow up a container ship.
[00:48:59.908 --> 00:49:00.709]  Jihadis did.
[00:49:01.169 --> 00:49:04.111]  The Egyptian military responded by killing them with helicopters.
[00:49:04.572 --> 00:49:06.953]  And our media decries it as attacking protesters.
[00:49:08.134 --> 00:49:10.977]  That is just some of the news on that front.
[00:49:11.357 --> 00:49:13.839]  Rocket kills 15 militants in Sinai.
[00:49:14.179 --> 00:49:15.500]  Egyptian state TV.
[00:49:16.361 --> 00:49:16.481]  U.S.
[00:49:16.521 --> 00:49:20.084]  fuels tension by deploying warships near Syria, says Russia.
[00:49:20.965 --> 00:49:23.827]  Egypt's Morrissey to stand trial over deaths.
[00:49:25.408 --> 00:49:29.512]  11 Morrissey supporters receive life in prison for aiding Al-Qaeda.
[00:49:30.976 --> 00:49:32.096]  Oh, and I told you this was coming.
[00:49:32.136 --> 00:49:40.719]  It's already coming to the U.S., but EU plans to fit all cars with speed limiters, so there's no way you can go faster and attach you by the mile, but in telegraph.
[00:49:41.039 --> 00:49:44.280]  This is the total technocratic control grid that's coming in.
[00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:47.141]  Dan in New York, current military.
[00:49:47.501 --> 00:49:51.822]  What service are you in, Dan, and what do you think about the West arming al-Qaeda?
[00:49:53.163 --> 00:49:53.443]  Hello?
[00:49:53.763 --> 00:49:54.003]  Yes, sir.
[00:49:55.106 --> 00:49:57.808]  Yeah, what do I think about Armand Al Qaeda?
[00:49:58.308 --> 00:50:04.452]  First of all, let's look back to September 11th, 2001, with the World Trade Center.
[00:50:04.953 --> 00:50:09.295]  We all know, you know, and you've advocated it yourself, that it was an inside job.
[00:50:09.976 --> 00:50:16.180]  To say that we are now supporting them was to say we supported them to take down the towers themselves.
[00:50:17.233 --> 00:50:18.774]  Is that right, or is that not right?
[00:50:19.074 --> 00:50:22.535]  Well, when I say inside job, this is an important question.
[00:50:22.916 --> 00:50:24.256]  There was definitely prior knowledge.
[00:50:24.276 --> 00:50:25.817]  There was definitely NORAD stand-downs.
[00:50:26.117 --> 00:50:29.359]  The supposed hijackers were dual-trained at U.S.
[00:50:29.439 --> 00:50:30.719]  bases on record.
[00:50:31.099 --> 00:50:32.160]  Mohammed Ata, all of them.
[00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:33.500]  I've interviewed the head of the embassy.
[00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:35.782]  They were ordered to let them back in to the U.S.
[00:50:36.222 --> 00:50:37.282]  nine months before 9-11.
[00:50:37.682 --> 00:50:39.603]  They were told these guys are really CIA.
[00:50:39.943 --> 00:50:42.084]  They were CIA guys.
[00:50:42.345 --> 00:50:42.825]  Shut up.
[00:50:42.905 --> 00:50:45.086]  We don't know exactly what happened.
[00:50:45.706 --> 00:50:47.747]  We just know the official story is inaccurate.
[00:50:48.347 --> 00:50:57.469]  So when I say inside job, they used it to take our liberties, and now they say Homeland Security is for veterans, gun owners, conservatives, libertarians.
[00:50:57.929 --> 00:51:00.650]  As I warned 11 years ago, they've now done it.
[00:51:00.670 --> 00:51:03.150]  But I'm gonna come back to you, Dan, to get your take on that.
[00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:06.111]  Tyler, Doc, and others, we'll be right back.
[00:51:07.995 --> 00:51:11.856]  Are you prepared for disasters, job loss, and uncertain times?

[00:52:20.995 --> 00:52:22.596]  It all comes down to one thing.
[00:52:22.936 --> 00:52:24.257]  We are what we eat.
[00:52:24.557 --> 00:52:28.901]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[00:52:29.241 --> 00:52:33.224]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[00:52:33.465 --> 00:52:35.787]  All of this has been engineered by design.

[00:54:10.091 --> 00:54:14.615]  All right, that last caller hung up.
[00:54:14.695 --> 00:54:19.098]  I wanted to get to his point of, do you support funding Al-Qaeda?
[00:54:19.118 --> 00:54:21.240]  I mean, they admit it's Al-Qaeda.
[00:54:22.041 --> 00:54:35.312]  It's a big deal that we forced this point out after two and a half years of hammering this, that now there's a global discussion about the people that run our country running Al-Qaeda to a great extent.
[00:54:36.638 --> 00:54:43.502]  And then when they're in another country, like Afghanistan, fighting people that just don't want us there, they then call them Al Qaeda.
[00:54:44.843 --> 00:54:47.805]  But then when it's real Al Qaeda, they're actually funding them.
[00:54:49.066 --> 00:54:50.446]  It's absolutely incredible.
[00:54:50.466 --> 00:54:53.028]  Let's talk to Doc in Delaware, who says he's military.
[00:54:53.568 --> 00:54:55.249]  What branch of the services are you in, sir?
[00:54:58.931 --> 00:54:59.792]  Let's go to Doc now.
[00:54:59.832 --> 00:55:00.893]  Can we punch Doc up, guys?
[00:55:02.232 --> 00:55:12.236]  I'm former and I have current access to spec op guys and intel guys that have been calling me almost non-stop over the last three or four days.
[00:55:12.836 --> 00:55:18.078]  I want to start the conversation by three points about Bin Laden and the family that's in the public record.
[00:55:18.658 --> 00:55:28.222]  First of all, within the first 48 hours after the attacks, the Bin Laden family was allowed to flee the country on Saudi airliners and they were never interrogated by the FBI.
[00:55:28.602 --> 00:55:30.603]  In the public record, mainstream media.
[00:55:31.063 --> 00:55:31.663]  Second point,
[00:55:32.082 --> 00:55:33.002]  Mainstream media.
[00:55:33.443 --> 00:55:39.425]  There is currently an Arabic Studies Chair at Harvard University funded by a Bin Laden Family Foundation.
[00:55:39.785 --> 00:55:41.646]  Third point in Colonel Pitt Schaeffer's book.
[00:55:42.166 --> 00:55:49.609]  Army intelligence tracked Araf to a residence in Brooklyn and had him under 24-hour surveillance, but of course the book was mostly redacted.
[00:55:50.129 --> 00:55:59.533]  The information I'm getting is that the attack, these attacks are being done by Saudi intelligence at our behest and that they're buying the sarin on the black market.
[00:56:01.084 --> 00:56:13.288]  Well yes sir, and then the jihadis are so badly coordinated that they shoot videos bragging while they launch the chemical attacks and the Turks caught them earlier this year twice now.
[00:56:14.048 --> 00:56:15.469]  That's in the Turkish newspapers.
[00:56:16.369 --> 00:56:20.130]  I'm of the Eastern Orthodox faith and I'm mostly Slavic background.
[00:56:20.170 --> 00:56:21.671]  Here's why I'm against this whole thing.
[00:56:22.411 --> 00:56:25.772]  There are videos on YouTube of these rebel clowns
[00:56:26.539 --> 00:56:31.723]  Parading our nuns through the streets with their hands up like prisoners with AK-47s at their backs.
[00:56:32.344 --> 00:56:39.410]  There are also videos on YouTube of these rebel clowns beheading our Orthodox priests in the street.
[00:56:39.850 --> 00:56:46.716]  As far as I'm concerned, these rebels are filth, and I do not care what Assad does with them or the Russians do with them.
[00:56:46.756 --> 00:56:48.958]  They're dogs, and they should die like dogs.
[00:56:50.353 --> 00:56:55.836]  Well, that's what all my military sources are saying, but the White House responds by saying you're a fake caller.
[00:56:56.317 --> 00:57:02.761]  You don't exist as active military, but everybody I talk to, Doc, says the same thing you're saying.
[00:57:03.121 --> 00:57:04.202]  Let me ask you this question.
[00:57:04.702 --> 00:57:08.164]  When you talk to other members of the military, what percentage are upset about this?
[00:57:08.184 --> 00:57:12.046]  80% and 90% on up.
[00:57:13.287 --> 00:57:14.268]  Yeah, that's what I'm getting.
[00:57:14.768 --> 00:57:17.450]  The people that I know that are true spec ops,
[00:57:18.130 --> 00:57:21.053]  Well, yeah, they caught him red-handed doing it.
[00:57:21.113 --> 00:57:26.857]  I wonder why they don't seem to care and aren't even upset that their own jihadis are on video loading the chemical mortars.
[00:57:43.695 --> 00:57:46.137]  Well, you see, Putin had a secret project, okay?
[00:57:46.677 --> 00:57:49.519]  Yeltsin was giving stuff away for bribes.
[00:57:49.959 --> 00:57:54.122]  Yeltsin appointed Putin because Clinton screwed the Russians.
[00:57:54.762 --> 00:57:58.524]  Putin was Yeltsin's successor at Yeltsin's choice.
[00:57:59.265 --> 00:58:04.028]  Putin had a secret project run by the FSB, which is a successor to the KGB.
[00:58:04.688 --> 00:58:08.791]  Putin, either by hook or by crook, bought back all
[00:58:09.329 --> 00:58:10.690]  No, no, you're right.
[00:58:10.710 --> 00:58:12.852]  That was led by Alexander Lebed, wasn't it?
[00:58:29.963 --> 00:58:37.187]  Yes, Alexander Levin, and that was published in public, Alex, in the Washington Times Post and the New York Times.
[00:58:37.327 --> 00:58:40.089]  Absolutely, the Russians do not want war, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:58:40.409 --> 00:58:44.332]  They're just trying to put their country back together, and the banksters want to play us off against them.
[00:58:44.652 --> 00:58:45.813]  We'll be right back with more calls.
[00:58:45.853 --> 00:58:46.333]  Thank you, sir.
[00:58:50.535 --> 00:58:54.518]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:58.487 --> 00:59:00.548]  It's hurricane and wildfire season again.
[00:59:00.568 --> 00:59:08.170]  Why do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year, betting their lives that the disaster won't get them?
[00:59:08.610 --> 00:59:13.251]  Hundreds of you helped eFoodsDirect ship 50,000 donated meals to the Oklahoma victims.
[00:59:13.531 --> 00:59:15.432]  The problem is we can't help everybody.
[00:59:15.712 --> 00:59:21.837]  If every one of us who can, will take care of ourselves, we can all pitch in to take care of those who really can't.
[00:59:22.117 --> 00:59:29.944]  The new Just-In-Case Pack from eFoods Direct is the big brother to the 7-Day Emergency Pack designed for Oklahoma disaster donations.
[00:59:30.344 --> 00:59:36.670]  It contains a 2-month supply for 1 person, or a 1-month supply for 2 adults, or a 2-week supply for a family of 4.
[00:59:37.310 --> 00:59:38.370]  The $320 price is $50 less than retail.
[00:59:38.431 --> 00:59:41.732]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.

[00:59:44.093 --> 00:59:47.214]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[00:59:47.474 --> 00:59:48.715]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:48.735 --> 00:59:50.095]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:12.591 --> 01:00:16.775]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:17.416 --> 01:00:18.237]  You want answers?
[01:00:19.018 --> 01:00:19.959]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:20.539 --> 01:00:24.203]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:24.744 --> 01:00:28.828]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:39.209 --> 01:00:44.573]  We've got photos up on InfoWars.com of John Kerry at his own home.
[01:00:45.193 --> 01:00:51.117]  Protestors came and beat on the doors and windows, getting some of his own medicine from real anti-war protestors.
[01:00:51.537 --> 01:00:53.959]  Wayne Madsen's going to be joining us coming up in the next segment.
[01:00:53.979 --> 01:00:58.422]  We'll continue with calls from active and inactive military reserve people.
[01:00:58.522 --> 01:01:07.628]  Very powerful call earlier, with extremely accurate info from what I've gotten from my sources, that 80% or more of the military, young, new, enlisted,
[01:01:08.348 --> 01:01:09.209]  You know, nothing against them.
[01:01:09.229 --> 01:01:09.749]  They're 18, 20 years old.
[01:01:09.769 --> 01:01:13.652]  They just want to drink beer and, you know, do push-ups or whatever.
[01:01:14.472 --> 01:01:22.058]  They don't really know what's going on, but anybody who's ever been in the military just a few years or longer, but then all the special ops people, they really know.
[01:01:22.398 --> 01:01:23.399]  Total false flag.
[01:01:23.879 --> 01:01:26.761]  And that's what Ron Paul and Pat Buchanan are saying.
[01:01:28.162 --> 01:01:28.703]  And Rand Paul.
[01:01:29.623 --> 01:01:31.625]  And the whole world press, because that's what it is.
[01:01:32.819 --> 01:01:37.700]  And see, in the past, everybody would know this, but you wouldn't say it because you'd get demonized.
[01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:42.981]  But see, now everybody's saying it, so the power to demonize and crush an Alex Jones.
[01:01:44.361 --> 01:01:44.881]  That's over.
[01:01:46.382 --> 01:01:48.022]  We're having a real discussion now.
[01:01:48.582 --> 01:01:58.104]  Let's go to Tyler in Tennessee, Inactive Reserve, then we'll go to Josiah, or is that Joshua and Steve?
[01:01:58.144 --> 01:01:59.304]  Go ahead, you're on the air, Tyler.
[01:02:00.737 --> 01:02:02.438]  I'm so excited to be on the air, Alex.
[01:02:02.478 --> 01:02:04.840]  I've been waiting and following you around for years.
[01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:06.361]  I've got something to say.
[01:02:06.381 --> 01:02:08.443]  It's pretty important for the troops.
[01:02:08.803 --> 01:02:16.970]  First and foremost, when you signed up, the first thing you did was you took an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States.
[01:02:17.850 --> 01:02:21.653]  You didn't take an oath to support and defend the President or anything like that.
[01:02:21.693 --> 01:02:26.277]  You took an oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:02:26.657 --> 01:02:27.858]  America is only great
[01:02:28.311 --> 01:02:30.457]  Because we have the Constitution.
[01:02:30.738 --> 01:02:35.250]  If you start playing by a different Constitution, then you're not America anymore.
[01:02:35.450 --> 01:02:36.313]  And you're not what's great.
[01:02:38.211 --> 01:02:51.817]  And it's so elementary what you just said, but it's still too complex for a lot of people who want to allow tyranny to take place because they don't want the Constitution and Bill of Rights blocking them from their power grabs.
[01:02:52.357 --> 01:03:05.002]  What do you think of the new army training manuals that are public in the last two weeks since Judicial Watch got them, where they actually badmouth the founding fathers and say they wouldn't be welcome in today's military?
[01:03:05.819 --> 01:03:07.301]  Oh, you know what doesn't surprise me at all?
[01:03:07.361 --> 01:03:07.902]  Here's the deal.
[01:03:07.962 --> 01:03:09.844]  I served six years in the Air Force.
[01:03:10.285 --> 01:03:12.307]  I've gone over there and fought in Afghanistan.
[01:03:12.628 --> 01:03:14.590]  I've done 4,000 miles of convoys over there.
[01:03:15.471 --> 01:03:22.340]  And I'll tell you what, what they do is they train you before you go, and they have you on the computer doing what's called computer-based training, or CBT.
[01:03:23.425 --> 01:03:27.187]  In these CB trees, or CBTs, there's all kinds of indoctrination.
[01:03:27.207 --> 01:03:33.850]  There's all kinds of stuff where you have to answer this question in the way they want it answered, or you don't get to finish this three-hour long CBT.
[01:03:34.170 --> 01:03:34.410]  Alright?
[01:03:34.450 --> 01:03:39.213]  So, and a lot of times the answer will be something obvious, like, you know, who perpetrated 9-11?
[01:03:39.553 --> 01:03:42.574]  You know, and they'll, you know, always, you know, the correct answer is Osama Bin Laden.
[01:03:42.594 --> 01:03:46.436]  You just have to hit that, you have to hit that answer, otherwise you don't get to complete this.
[01:03:46.812 --> 01:03:49.978]  And if you don't get that turned in, well then you get yelled at because you're supposed to have it done.
[01:03:49.998 --> 01:03:56.430]  And so they keep bombarding you with this propaganda and stuff like that against the founding fathers doesn't surprise me at all.
[01:03:58.593 --> 01:04:07.781]  It's like 145 pages long and it says, don't listen to people that claim they want to make the world a better place and talk about the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:04:08.182 --> 01:04:11.485]  They're probably extremists or even terrorists.
[01:04:11.525 --> 01:04:14.868]  I'm paraphrasing, but it basically, I showed it last week, it actually says that.
[01:04:15.268 --> 01:04:23.516]  I mean, if I was sitting there reading that, you swear an oath to that and they're saying it's basically terrorist, but that's what all the FBI training manuals say.
[01:04:23.996 --> 01:04:25.037]  And I know who wrote it!
[01:04:25.157 --> 01:04:28.920]  I know who wrote it, because I've read it literally a hundred times or more.
[01:04:29.341 --> 01:04:30.642]  Southern Poverty Law Center.
[01:04:30.682 --> 01:04:31.303]  Go ahead, sorry.
[01:04:32.083 --> 01:04:39.150]  Well, they'll have pictures on these CBTs of people who are, you know, the supposed enemies and people you're supposed to be trained to watch out for.
[01:04:39.470 --> 01:04:41.712]  And they'll have pictures of, like, peace protesters.
[01:04:42.242 --> 01:04:46.523]  Or just like peacefully protesting and they'll be like, man, you better keep an eye out on these people kind of a thing.
[01:04:46.543 --> 01:04:47.804]  Like you never know who it could be.
[01:04:47.824 --> 01:04:48.844]  It could be these people.
[01:04:48.864 --> 01:04:50.904]  It could be anti-war protesters.
[01:04:51.165 --> 01:04:54.906]  Like someone who's preaching against war is the person who's going to kill you.
[01:04:56.586 --> 01:04:57.546]  Tell you what, stay there.
[01:04:57.606 --> 01:04:59.267]  I'm going to come back to you and let you finish up.
[01:04:59.287 --> 01:05:02.108]  Then we're going to go to Steve, John, and others to get their take.
[01:05:02.148 --> 01:05:03.108]  Wayne Mattson's coming up.
[01:05:03.408 --> 01:05:06.469]  But I want to ask you, talking to current military friends,
[01:05:08.399 --> 01:05:15.704]  Dozens of diseases ranging from the common cold and flu to MRSA and pneumonia are all caused by infectious pathogens.
[01:05:16.144 --> 01:05:19.946]  Fortunately, a simple, safe and effective alternative exists.

[01:08:19.029 --> 01:08:19.930]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:20.570 --> 01:08:24.193]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:24.773 --> 01:08:28.856]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:37.352 --> 01:08:41.215]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen, now into hour number two.
[01:08:42.315 --> 01:08:46.898]  Coming up at the start of the next hour, we're going to have Rowdy Roddy Piper joining us.
[01:08:46.918 --> 01:08:52.662]  It's the 25th anniversary of one of my favorite films, They Live, dealing with the nature of reality.
[01:08:52.682 --> 01:09:00.487]  We're going to be getting him on the broadcast with Sean Stone, filmmaker in his own right, actor, obviously the son of Oliver Stone.
[01:09:01.650 --> 01:09:03.172]  He'll be giving us his take on the Middle East.
[01:09:03.212 --> 01:09:05.695]  He's traveled over there extensively.
[01:09:05.755 --> 01:09:17.229]  Right now we're taking phone calls from active duty or people that are in the reserves or people that recently got out who've been talking to friends and family that are in the military.
[01:09:17.790 --> 01:09:20.833]  What is their take on aiding radical Islamic
[01:09:21.992 --> 01:09:26.013]  Groups over in the Middle East ie Al Qaeda.
[01:09:26.613 --> 01:09:49.760]  This is now a big firestorm as Rand Paul comes out and says I don't want to send our boys over there to fight for Al Qaeda against Christians to impose surreal law in Syria and In two different shows the McLaughlin group and Newsmax that Buchanan comes out and says it's clearly a false flag staged event Ron Paul says it Rand Paul says it this is panicking the system then
[01:09:51.181 --> 01:10:00.207]  Thousands of military personnel take photos of themselves with a sheet of paper saying, I don't want to fight on the side of Al-Qaeda in Syria.
[01:10:01.468 --> 01:10:02.549]  Wake up America!
[01:10:03.810 --> 01:10:07.492]  And mainstream media claims military revolt against Obama is a hoax.
[01:10:07.652 --> 01:10:12.596]  Even though these people have this on their own Facebook and their own Twitters, some of them are officers saying who they are.
[01:10:13.957 --> 01:10:15.898]  Watch them start trying to court-martial them.
[01:10:17.762 --> 01:10:19.543]  I'd like to see them actually get convicted.
[01:10:19.563 --> 01:10:20.443]  It isn't going to happen.
[01:10:21.063 --> 01:10:25.985]  And it's this type of action that brought down Ceausescu in Romania, that brought down the Soviet Union.
[01:10:26.346 --> 01:10:35.790]  If the military wakes up and the police wake up and start realizing the paradigm of how the globalists are funding radicals to attack us so they have a pretext to take our liberties, it's game over.
[01:10:36.230 --> 01:10:38.090]  That's why this is such a big deal.
[01:10:39.291 --> 01:10:41.052]  And Obama was going to launch this new war.
[01:10:42.425 --> 01:10:47.029]  Expand the old war to open air bombardment because his Al-Qaeda forces are losing.
[01:10:47.470 --> 01:10:48.651]  Now that's imploding.
[01:10:49.051 --> 01:10:51.713]  There's a good chance they're not going to get the votes in the House.
[01:10:52.754 --> 01:10:53.675]  That's coming out now.
[01:10:53.875 --> 01:10:56.037]  Rand Paul and others have talked to the folks in the House.
[01:10:56.437 --> 01:11:00.761]  Boehner is in there saying, well we need to vote for military action because of what Assad did.
[01:11:01.872 --> 01:11:03.954]  It's been proven that the rebels did it.
[01:11:04.254 --> 01:11:06.315]  It's certainly not been proven that Assad did it.
[01:11:06.595 --> 01:11:13.280]  Wayne Madsen is going to join us in five minutes, formerly with the NSA, syndicated columnist and amazing journalist, to give us his inside scoop on this.
[01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:18.523]  He's always got the latest on how big a defeat this is for the globalists.
[01:11:18.543 --> 01:11:21.145]  We'll get his take on that and where he thinks they're going from here.
[01:11:21.185 --> 01:11:29.231]  Will they stage a false flag to try to get everybody back in line under this paradigm of fear and to go against logic and to work with Al Qaeda?
[01:11:31.010 --> 01:11:36.793]  Do I get an apology from all the neocon talk show hosts that attacked me over the years pointing out that elements of our government run Al Qaeda?
[01:11:38.213 --> 01:11:39.534]  No, I'm not going to hold my breath.
[01:11:40.134 --> 01:11:41.355]  But see, I don't want an apology.
[01:11:41.735 --> 01:11:45.177]  All I want is to go back to being more of a free country.
[01:11:45.837 --> 01:11:47.618]  I don't have any illusions we'll ever be perfect.
[01:11:48.058 --> 01:11:50.259]  I just want to be somewhat free.
[01:11:51.220 --> 01:11:58.183]  I just want to swing the pendulum back in the other direction, not headlong over the edge of a cliff towards total despotism!
[01:11:58.936 --> 01:12:03.919]  Now let's real quick go back to Tyler, wanted to finish up in active reserve.
[01:12:04.300 --> 01:12:10.504]  Talking to your friends, talking to other people that are in the military, are they upset about the funding of Al Qaeda?
[01:12:11.044 --> 01:12:18.129]  What is their take on what's happening and what do you make of the dinosaur media saying nobody in the military is upset about this?
[01:12:19.550 --> 01:12:24.093]  Oh I think that it's an absolute atrocity for them to even claim that.
[01:12:24.133 --> 01:12:24.974]  I think it's apparent
[01:12:25.692 --> 01:12:27.853]  Uh, that the military is definitely not behind it.
[01:12:28.033 --> 01:12:37.317]  And, uh, you know, over the past couple of years, I've always been sort of the black sheep, uh, you know, in my, you know, with the guys I was working with, you know, bringing up issues because they weren't quite aware.
[01:12:37.337 --> 01:12:46.561]  But I'll tell you what, now, as I, you know, as I become more comfortable with this reality, uh, they're, they're more comfortable, you know, letting people know their opinions now.
[01:12:47.001 --> 01:12:50.403]  And, uh, you know, they're surprised to learn that many people actually agree with them.
[01:12:51.227 --> 01:12:52.708]  Uh, you know, many people actually agree with him.
[01:12:52.728 --> 01:12:54.410]  Hey, I don't, I don't, I don't support this war.
[01:12:54.450 --> 01:12:55.991]  In fact, I don't support any of these wars.
[01:12:56.371 --> 01:12:57.972]  I mean, I've gone over there and I've followed orders.
[01:12:58.353 --> 01:13:00.875]  But, you know, it's not something, you know, politically, it's not what I support.
[01:13:01.295 --> 01:13:05.278]  And actually, it's the, uh, it's one of the primary reasons that I got out.
[01:13:05.318 --> 01:13:06.359]  I just got out about a month ago.
[01:13:07.540 --> 01:13:09.101]  Well, Tyler, God bless you.
[01:13:10.222 --> 01:13:11.023]  So, were you in the Army?
[01:13:11.043 --> 01:13:11.503]  The Marines?
[01:13:11.523 --> 01:13:12.524]  What were you inactive in?
[01:13:12.584 --> 01:13:13.384]  Oh, you said Air Force.
[01:13:14.385 --> 01:13:14.605]  Yes, sir.
[01:13:14.625 --> 01:13:15.326]  I was in the Air Force.
[01:13:16.343 --> 01:13:25.446]  Yeah, I learned a lot right after Benghazi from an Air Force MP was high level on a flight back from the West.
[01:13:25.786 --> 01:13:32.368]  He was going to be the main guy at a burial of a fellow that had died by an IED.
[01:13:32.388 --> 01:13:33.609]  It was his buddy.
[01:13:34.169 --> 01:13:37.270]  And he talked about Air Force security running convoys, how dangerous it was.
[01:13:37.770 --> 01:13:39.651]  And you're saying that's what you did in Afghanistan?
[01:13:40.714 --> 01:13:40.994]  Yes, sir.
[01:13:41.014 --> 01:13:41.895]  That's actually what I did.
[01:13:41.975 --> 01:13:48.801]  I did about 4,000 miles of convoy out there, primarily in southern Afghanistan, with a crew of about 40-something dudes.
[01:13:49.261 --> 01:13:54.225]  And, you know, Air Force isn't typically, you know, we're not usually known for doing convoys and stuff, but that's what we ended up doing.
[01:13:54.745 --> 01:14:03.413]  Well, no, it's just interesting, because that's what... Sure, sure, because, I mean, I met this guy, well, these two guys, but really talked to this one guy, for like two hours back on a flight.
[01:14:04.733 --> 01:14:07.974]  And then I saw it in the paper, you know, him in the paper and the burial and all that.
[01:14:09.435 --> 01:14:14.636]  But he was just telling me about how much combat the Air Force sees now around these bases.
[01:14:15.016 --> 01:14:15.517]  Thanks a lot.
[01:14:15.537 --> 01:14:16.897]  I appreciate you calling into the show.
[01:14:18.157 --> 01:14:23.099]  What Tyler just talked about is exactly what I'm getting from all my military sources.
[01:14:24.099 --> 01:14:30.241]  And again, it's very, very frustrating to see the dinosaur media basically say, oh, that's all just a hoax.
[01:14:31.522 --> 01:14:32.282]  When it's not a hoax.
[01:14:34.107 --> 01:14:37.335]  The military is very, very upset about what's going on.
[01:14:38.779 --> 01:14:40.904]  And we, the people, should be upset.
[01:14:40.944 --> 01:14:43.149]  But Tyler is a shock troop.
[01:14:46.451 --> 01:14:50.313]  Years ago, he'd tell his buddies about this, and they just couldn't believe it.
[01:14:50.973 --> 01:14:57.176]  But now, because they heard all this before, now that they're seeing it happen again, now they're fully waking up.
[01:14:57.496 --> 01:15:06.380]  And that's why you see, as the earlier caller said, 80 to 90% of the Special Forces guys that he works with are awake and very upset.
[01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:10.182]  Well, of course, because they're involved in all the secret stuff, folks.
[01:15:10.562 --> 01:15:12.543]  They have to go actually train.
[01:15:13.003 --> 01:15:15.044]  Can you imagine having to train jihadis?
[01:15:17.009 --> 01:15:23.594]  They bring in and who they tell to cut off their beards and they tell to, you know, not upset the tribs and just get their training.
[01:15:23.794 --> 01:15:25.575]  But these guys start shooting their mouths off.
[01:15:26.936 --> 01:15:33.641]  And you start getting in arguments with the special forces who've got, you know, tattoos that say infidel on them.
[01:15:34.181 --> 01:15:39.645]  Most of them you run into have like infidel on their forearm or are on their trigger finger.
[01:15:41.328 --> 01:15:43.650]  Or other expletives towards Muslim extremists.
[01:15:43.870 --> 01:15:44.551]  Can you imagine?
[01:15:45.091 --> 01:15:46.312]  These guys are all in there together.
[01:15:46.332 --> 01:15:47.934]  And they're having to train them.
[01:15:47.954 --> 01:15:49.335]  I mean, there's fights breaking out.
[01:15:50.316 --> 01:15:52.057]  I've been told about them shooting each other.
[01:15:52.077 --> 01:15:54.259]  I mean, this is really bad, folks.
[01:15:56.040 --> 01:15:59.783]  The troops have to train Al-Qaeda and Al-Qaeda lite and all this other garbage.
[01:16:02.386 --> 01:16:05.610]  It's incredible, and they are burning up and blowing up the churches.
[01:16:06.230 --> 01:16:11.076]  They are engaging in all this, and the military is at the breaking point over this.
[01:16:12.037 --> 01:16:16.381]  In fact, I can't believe it's gone this far, and I don't know what the breaking point is going to be.
[01:16:17.233 --> 01:16:19.555]  But the New World Order has really miscalculated.
[01:16:19.775 --> 01:16:20.596]  They've jumped the shark.
[01:16:20.616 --> 01:16:23.699]  We're going to go back to your calls, but I want to get Wayne Madsen's take on this.
[01:16:24.139 --> 01:16:31.086]  Wayne Madsen, formerly with the NSA, in Navy, anti-submarine warfare, before that, written for some of the biggest publications in the country.
[01:16:31.126 --> 01:16:33.628]  WayneMadsenReport.com is his site.
[01:16:34.549 --> 01:16:36.591]  To read his updates in Weekly Journal.
[01:17:05.409 --> 01:17:16.433]  Yes, partially, Alex, and I can tell you that as of last Friday, and this comes from White House sources who were willing to talk about what happened last Friday night.
[01:17:16.553 --> 01:17:33.798]  Last Friday night, President Obama had agreed to launch, probably in the wee hours of Saturday morning, East Coast time, this cruise missile attack, and possibly with a drone attack on Syrian targets.
[01:17:34.479 --> 01:17:47.820]  He bought off on what was pressured upon him by our ambassador to the UN, Susan Rice, the national, I should say, Ambassador to the UN, Samantha Power.
[01:17:49.350 --> 01:17:52.432]  The National Security Advisor and former Ambassador to the U.N.
[01:17:52.472 --> 01:18:08.546]  Susan Rice, Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes, who I would point out has two brothers in executive positions at CBS News and NBC News, and also Secretary of State Kerry.
[01:18:10.282 --> 01:18:29.694]  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Martin Dempsey, General Dempsey, visited the White House very early in the morning on Saturday morning, right after midnight, with one last plea and basically told Obama, look, if you attack Syria, you're going to get in deep.
[01:18:30.314 --> 01:18:34.897]  And when you get in deep, without congressional authorization, you're going to be screwed.
[01:18:36.238 --> 01:18:54.746]  Upon hearing that from Dempsey, Obama decided to hold off, try to get congressional approval, and I guess we can thank, in this case, so much unlike what happened with President Kennedy and the Cuban Missile Crisis, in this case, the generals
[01:18:56.095 --> 01:19:02.997]  Actually stood in the way between Obama attacking Syria and maintaining this very tenuous peace.
[01:19:03.117 --> 01:19:07.819]  And by the way, everything you're saying has actually been in the Israeli news and a lot of it's been confirmed.
[01:19:08.259 --> 01:19:11.100]  And it's on record that Dempsey keeps telling Obama don't do it.
[01:19:11.620 --> 01:19:17.221]  And then Obama got up there on a Saturday afternoon speech and lied and said Dempsey was behind his plan.
[01:19:17.601 --> 01:19:22.763]  But I guess he means Dempsey said you better get congressional approval and not go this alone.
[01:19:23.737 --> 01:19:50.348]  Well, Dempsey has not only convinced Obama to get congressional approval, which is by no means a sure thing, but also Dempsey is of the opinion that once this conflagration begins, the Pentagon will not necessarily be able to stop it because of the war games that the Pentagon has conducted over the years that all
[01:19:51.228 --> 01:19:54.390]  Many of which show that this thing could spiral out of control.
[01:19:54.830 --> 01:20:03.315]  Just like with an attack, preemptive military attack on Iran, this preemptive military attack on Syria shows some of the same results.
[01:20:03.615 --> 01:20:13.080]  Sure, I mean, don't most analysts, including former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, former members of the Joint Chiefs, they're all on record saying this would probably turn into a bigger regional war.
[01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:20.765]  Syria and Iran will hit Israel, then Israel might respond even with nukes, or the U.S.
[01:20:20.785 --> 01:20:28.450]  gets drugged in, then it's the Russians, then it's World War III, and what's the American geopolitical reason?
[01:20:28.530 --> 01:20:36.215]  This only hurts our interest with Assad, who in the last, again, eight years, tried to start working with the West.
[01:20:36.235 --> 01:20:42.299]  The message is, you try to democratize and work with us, we're going to turn al-Qaeda loose in your country.
[01:20:43.257 --> 01:21:02.803]  This has to do with Obama trying to placate a bunch of adolescent, as far as military strategy is concerned, Samantha Power, Susan Rice, who are nothing more than a couple of spoiled brats who want to
[01:21:04.023 --> 01:21:08.785]  You know, they feel the way you get somebody like Assad is just to attack them.
[01:21:09.445 --> 01:21:21.250]  We have this Ben Rose, who obviously is part of this operation with his two brothers at CBS and NBC to gin up the propaganda for the war, but they're not listening to the season.
[01:21:22.777 --> 01:21:30.684]  Military strategists, the seasoned military officers, who know what is going to happen when we do this.
[01:21:31.265 --> 01:21:35.269]  Obama's listening to these responsibility to protect, you know?
[01:21:36.890 --> 01:21:44.538]  A group of people stubbed their toe in some country, they want to go in and, you know, with the full force of the United States and rectify the situation.
[01:21:45.639 --> 01:21:48.141]  That's not how geopolitics work.
[01:21:48.201 --> 01:21:49.462]  Plus, that's a total cover.
[01:21:49.502 --> 01:21:52.805]  It's about regime change, breaking that country up in multiple parts.
[01:21:53.225 --> 01:21:55.167]  They started it two and a half years ago.
[01:21:55.207 --> 01:21:58.830]  But expanding on this, I don't think the new world order is going to fall tomorrow.
[01:21:59.350 --> 01:22:03.914]  My point is that there is a collapse in confidence in the system.
[01:22:04.375 --> 01:22:08.999]  The military is waking up and it's panicking the power structure.
[01:22:09.339 --> 01:22:10.760]  And I'm not the only one saying that.
[01:22:11.201 --> 01:22:12.041]  A former member
[01:22:12.882 --> 01:22:13.982]  of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
[01:22:14.322 --> 01:22:17.043]  General Jack Keane is saying that in the New York Times.
[01:22:17.403 --> 01:22:22.364]  You've got Dr. Paul Craig Roberts saying it's the biggest diplomatic failure in forever.
[01:22:22.384 --> 01:22:39.008]  I mean, it makes them look like total fools, but in a way that's scarier, that it is a bunch of weirdo women, nothing against women, but these women are weirdo nanny state women, playing general, and all these weirdo neocons, you know, who are too busy, you know, hanging out,
[01:22:39.974 --> 01:22:40.774]  Well, you know what they're doing.
[01:22:40.814 --> 01:22:53.059]  The point is, it's almost more scary, though, that you've got a bunch of weirdos on power trips and bankers trying to call military shots against Russia and China through this proxy.
[01:22:53.699 --> 01:22:55.700]  And so I want you to comment on that, but first go back.
[01:22:55.940 --> 01:22:59.501]  Historically, how big a deal is this defeat for Obama?
[01:23:00.046 --> 01:23:29.328]  The fact that the British Parliament for the first time voted not to go to war, not to authorize war since 1782, when they voted not to maintain Britain's colonial army, the army of occupation in the American colonies, and then decided to sue for peace, this is a big deal because this effectively drives a stake in what was known as the U.S.-British special relationship.
[01:23:29.788 --> 01:23:36.271]  Look, the Central Command in Tampa is now freezing out all British military officers from all planning exercises.
[01:23:36.291 --> 01:23:38.272]  Oh yeah, I forgot, that's in the Associated Press.
[01:23:38.552 --> 01:23:39.873]  How big a deal is that?
[01:23:40.433 --> 01:23:47.376]  That, like, childishly blaming the British military like they're the Parliament when our own military doesn't want to do it.
[01:23:47.736 --> 01:23:53.019]  Clearly above the military, ordering all the British officers thrown out of the war rooms.
[01:23:53.279 --> 01:23:55.160]  This is, I mean, this is incredible.
[01:23:55.965 --> 01:24:12.974]  It is, and you know, we're one step away, I guess, from the officers club at MacDill Air Force Base serving up Thomas Freedom muffins and offering up Freedom ale and Freedom marmalade.
[01:24:14.913 --> 01:24:16.994]  Uh, you know, it's childish.
[01:24:17.074 --> 01:24:19.395]  It's absolutely childish what we're seeing happen.
[01:24:19.435 --> 01:24:25.998]  But look, this isn't the generals doing this to their British officer colleagues.
[01:24:26.438 --> 01:24:28.719]  This is coming from the White House.
[01:24:28.759 --> 01:24:30.220]  This is the same sort of
[01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:39.202]  Petty punishment we saw when the French opted not to support us with the foolish invasion of Iraq.
[01:24:39.242 --> 01:24:49.025]  And by the way, the British have now responded, just to finish up the point you raised, by saying, fine, there won't be another vote even if there's another nerve gas attack, because they know they're just going to stage another one.
[01:24:49.425 --> 01:24:53.286]  So now rebuffing them, now the British are going to act childish.
[01:24:53.626 --> 01:24:56.927]  This is the kind of stuff you see before regimes disintegrate.
[01:24:57.441 --> 01:25:00.144]  That's right, and you're right.
[01:25:00.684 --> 01:25:09.713]  This is a sea change, but let's look at what's happening in light of what's happening with the revelations of Edward Snowden, the NSA whistleblower.
[01:25:10.093 --> 01:25:14.277]  This is like a double, and if you add in the WikiLeaks stuff, which I don't put a whole lot of
[01:25:14.877 --> 01:25:17.638]  Wait on the WikiLeaks disclosures.
[01:25:17.738 --> 01:25:24.100]  Not as much as the NSA stuff, but we're seeing at least a double whammy against the United States.
[01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:32.022]  You've got Dilma Rousseff, the Brazilian president, thinking about cancelling her state visit to Washington.
[01:25:32.062 --> 01:25:39.064]  The only state visit that Obama has scheduled for this year because of NSA eavesdropping on her private communication.
[01:25:39.084 --> 01:25:41.805]  You've got Obama cancelling any more press conferences.
[01:25:42.045 --> 01:25:43.646]  This is a collapse level event!
[01:25:45.166 --> 01:25:47.167]  It really is.
[01:25:47.327 --> 01:25:59.189]  I think what we're seeing is the beginning of the end of this American exceptionalism around the world, that we can do anything we want and expect everybody will go along with us.
[01:26:00.310 --> 01:26:01.510]  Russia's not buying this.
[01:26:01.610 --> 01:26:03.850]  China is not buying this.
[01:26:04.251 --> 01:26:05.031]  I think we're seeing
[01:26:06.671 --> 01:26:09.933]  The beginning, the beginning of the end of the American Empire.
[01:26:10.073 --> 01:26:22.218]  We will probably wind up being a regional power with influence over the Caribbean and Canada and some of the Pacific Ocean countries, but nothing like what we see today.
[01:26:22.478 --> 01:26:23.659]  And I want to explain something.
[01:26:23.939 --> 01:26:32.143]  I believe this is the beginning of the rebirth of the Republic, because it's not an American empire, though we use that term because that's what's known.
[01:26:32.603 --> 01:26:37.946]  It's a globalist, bankster empire, using America and our treasure and our name.
[01:26:38.186 --> 01:26:47.191]  The only reason we were honored and the reason people worked with us was because, compared to the other countries and empires, we were guys that played somewhat more fair.
[01:26:47.672 --> 01:26:49.753]  But as soon as we lost that soft power,
[01:26:50.493 --> 01:26:55.417]  And as soon as the world figured out we had wicked people running us, all the power is draining out.
[01:26:55.797 --> 01:27:02.042]  And because we are occupied by the globalists here in America, that just doesn't mean the rest of the world isn't going to be occupied now.
[01:27:02.542 --> 01:27:04.864]  It means we aren't going to be occupied as bad.
[01:27:05.184 --> 01:27:06.665]  Because as they fall back here...
[01:27:07.506 --> 01:27:09.628]  And say, well at least we can rule America.
[01:27:09.868 --> 01:27:27.444]  That's not going to work either, because as soon as the dollar's dead, it's over for the federal government and the New World Order and all these idiot federal workers, pensions and all, and most of them aren't bad people, they actually know that's true, but the types that think, you know, they rule the roost, you know, let me tell you, this is going to get wild though, Wayne.
[01:27:28.311 --> 01:27:33.213]  Yeah, and the other thing we're seeing, too, is that we're seeing faulty intelligence being sold.
[01:27:34.393 --> 01:27:38.294]  The French and German intelligence reports, they're not showing any evidence.
[01:27:38.574 --> 01:27:53.839]  They're saying, believe us, you know, after the British dodgy dossier that got us convinced that we should go into Iraq and got the British people convinced to go in Iraq, nobody should be falling for this stuff out of the intelligence agencies.
[01:27:54.179 --> 01:28:09.418]  You know, basically Obama is relying almost exclusively on Israeli signals intelligence said to come from intercepts by unit 8200, that's Israel's version of the NSA, of Syrian commanders ordering this attack.
[01:28:09.958 --> 01:28:25.178]  We nobody can make the determination that the Syrian government had anything to do with the attack until the actual missiles that are being cited by the French are actually in, you know, examine to make sure that they actually ever had anything like sarin gas.
[01:28:25.218 --> 01:28:26.981]  But what we do know is Al Qaeda.
[01:28:27.561 --> 01:28:31.102]  Yeah, they're getting caught over and over again by our allies
[01:28:50.689 --> 01:29:01.640]  With these different gases, poison gases, and then they still have the nerve to blame Assad, but no one... What do you make of Pat Buchanan, Ron Paul, Rand Paul, all coming out and saying false flag?
[01:29:01.881 --> 01:29:02.962]  I mean, this is exciting!
[01:29:03.904 --> 01:29:19.812]  Yes, I'm glad they're finally putting false flag into the lexicon of American politics, because we've been treated to these false flags so many times in the past, and immediately people are accused of being conspiracy theorists.
[01:29:19.832 --> 01:29:21.173]  Here's my last question, Wayne Madsen.
[01:29:21.493 --> 01:29:22.573]  What about false flag?
[01:29:22.994 --> 01:29:29.517]  Isn't that one of the only tools they've got now, is a big domestic or foreign false flag to blame on, and say, see, we told you so?
[01:29:30.290 --> 01:29:31.811]  Yeah, that's exactly what's going on.
[01:29:31.831 --> 01:29:41.578]  That's why the BBC ran a phony photograph, a false photograph of dead civilians in Iraq and said these were people that were killed by the siren attack in Syria.
[01:29:41.878 --> 01:29:43.879]  This has happened time and time again.
[01:29:43.919 --> 01:29:52.945]  We've seen a video of canisters being handled by Chechen guerrillas that were taking them into Syria to give them over to the rebels.
[01:29:53.125 --> 01:29:53.766]  Incredible.
[01:29:54.706 --> 01:29:56.267]  Wayne Madsen, thank you so much, sir.
[01:29:56.287 --> 01:29:56.928]  We'll talk to you more.
[01:29:57.148 --> 01:29:58.028]  We're on the march.
[01:29:58.529 --> 01:30:00.149]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:01.070 --> 01:30:03.831]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:08.293 --> 01:30:11.055]  Protecting your home with a security system is a must.
[01:30:11.275 --> 01:30:17.318]  But when it comes to protecting your family, your home, and belongings, there's no need to sign a long-term contract.
[01:30:17.658 --> 01:30:24.041]  Listen, there is some real scum in the alarm business cashing in by locking you into long, punishing contracts.
[01:30:24.441 --> 01:30:26.402]  Not with SimpliSafe Home Security.
[01:30:26.743 --> 01:30:27.783]  They're the good guys.
[01:30:28.084 --> 01:30:30.785]  You can trust SimpliSafe to protect your family.
[01:30:31.146 --> 01:30:35.448]  SimpliSafe was created by a Harvard Business School engineer and it's revolutionary.

[01:31:09.404 --> 01:31:11.105]  And you're subject to other police action.
[01:31:11.865 --> 01:31:12.825]  Tyranny is here.
[01:31:13.146 --> 01:31:16.827]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:31:16.867 --> 01:31:19.288]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:31:19.308 --> 01:31:24.750]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:31:25.170 --> 01:31:31.413]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:31:31.833 --> 01:31:37.376]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:31:37.816 --> 01:31:41.478]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:31:41.978 --> 01:31:46.000]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:31:46.280 --> 01:31:51.803]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:31:52.223 --> 01:31:55.204]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:31:55.785 --> 01:31:57.205]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:31:57.746 --> 01:31:58.186]  It's here.

[01:32:08.469 --> 01:32:10.550]  It's hurricane and wildfire season again.
[01:32:10.570 --> 01:32:18.153]  Why do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year betting their lives that the disaster won't get them?
[01:32:18.593 --> 01:32:23.254]  Hundreds of you helped eFoodsDirect ship 50,000 donated meals to the Oklahoma victims.
[01:32:23.534 --> 01:32:25.435]  The problem is we can't help everybody.
[01:32:25.695 --> 01:32:31.821]  If every one of us who can will take care of ourselves, we can all pitch in to take care of those who really can't.
[01:32:32.121 --> 01:32:39.928]  The new Just In Case Pack from eFoods Direct is the big brother to the 7-Day Emergency Pack designed for Oklahoma disaster donations.
[01:32:40.328 --> 01:32:46.654]  It contains a 2-month supply for 1 person, or a 1-month supply for 2 adults, or a 2-week supply for a family of 4.
[01:32:46.714 --> 01:32:47.715]  The $320 price is $50 less than retail.
[01:32:51.258 --> 01:32:52.319]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[01:32:52.359 --> 01:32:54.082]  Order two or more, get 10% off, free shipping applies.
[01:32:54.102 --> 01:32:57.105]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[01:33:09.181 --> 01:33:14.243]  There is a signal broadcast every second of every day through our television sets.
[01:33:14.443 --> 01:33:19.345]  Even when the set is turned off, look around at the environment we live in.
[01:33:19.845 --> 01:33:24.307]  Carbon dioxide, fluorocarbons, and methane have increased since 1958.
[01:33:24.467 --> 01:33:27.708]  Earth is being acclimatized.
[01:33:28.288 --> 01:33:32.310]  They are turning our atmosphere into their atmosphere.
[01:33:32.970 --> 01:33:35.271]  We are like a natural resource to them.
[01:33:36.064 --> 01:33:37.004]  Deplete the planet?
[01:33:37.044 --> 01:33:39.265]  Move on to another.
[01:33:39.366 --> 01:33:41.226]  They want benign indifference.
[01:33:41.707 --> 01:33:43.647]  They want us druggie.
[01:33:43.687 --> 01:33:44.648]  We could be pets.
[01:33:45.208 --> 01:33:46.249]  We could be food.
[01:33:46.789 --> 01:33:50.390]  But all we really are is livestock.
[01:33:50.551 --> 01:33:52.772]  Our impulses are being redirected.
[01:33:53.492 --> 01:33:58.194]  We are living in an artificially induced state of consciousness that resembles
[01:34:02.577 --> 01:34:08.680]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[01:34:16.163 --> 01:34:20.124]  Rowdy Roddy Piper is going to be popping in with us at the start of the next hour.
[01:34:20.144 --> 01:34:23.786]  For 30 minutes then we'll continue with phone calls and your news.
[01:34:23.806 --> 01:34:31.149]  I know we've got loaded phone lines of former and current active-duty military who want to give us their take on our government openly funding Al-Qaeda.
[01:34:32.029 --> 01:34:34.793]  Uh, to try to overthrow Syria and calling them protesters.
[01:34:35.514 --> 01:34:39.138]  And Obama getting rebuffed and having to back off launching a hot war.
[01:34:39.158 --> 01:34:40.820]  Uh, how big a deal that is.
[01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:45.326]  We're going to be talking to Sean Stone, writer, director, actor, a friend of mine, very interesting fellow.
[01:34:45.346 --> 01:34:46.427]  He's traveled extensively.
[01:34:47.088 --> 01:34:47.168]  Yes.
[01:35:05.233 --> 01:35:12.020]  Before I do that, most talk show hosts plug not just during their ads that the network have, but every break, every segment.
[01:35:12.040 --> 01:35:14.683]  You know, you're brought to you by this, by this, by that.
[01:35:15.363 --> 01:35:15.864]  That's great.
[01:35:15.904 --> 01:35:16.585]  I'm glad they do that.
[01:35:17.145 --> 01:35:23.212]  I skip commercial breaks as I did earlier, which I basically have to, at the end of the day, ends up costing us money.
[01:35:23.911 --> 01:35:26.572]  I end up never plugging anything, and it's insane.
[01:35:27.332 --> 01:35:32.113]  So when I do plug stuff, number one, I go out and find the very best products, no matter what they are.
[01:35:32.193 --> 01:35:43.076]  Books, films, t-shirts, things to wake people up, the best non-GMO, non-hybrid, open-pollinated seeds, the best water filtration systems.
[01:35:43.716 --> 01:35:44.676]  It's all there.
[01:35:44.816 --> 01:35:51.378]  Infowarsstore.com or infowarshop.com will also get you the same place.
[01:35:55.410 --> 01:36:14.803]  Now again, InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsShop.com will take you to our online shopping cart that has amazing Pro Liberty t-shirts, almost a hundred different designs, women's t-shirts, Don't Tread on Me, Come and Take It, 1776 shirts, you name it.

[01:36:40.990 --> 01:36:45.713]  We have a lot of other great water filtration systems as well, like the LifeStraw, or call toll-free.
[01:36:45.793 --> 01:36:48.395]  We can answer your questions and take your order over the phone.
[01:36:48.415 --> 01:36:48.815]  888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[01:36:48.855 --> 01:36:53.519]  There's also a mail order address there on the site, PO Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760.
[01:36:53.639 --> 01:36:56.501]  And we could not have done any of this without you.
[01:37:07.668 --> 01:37:09.391]  And we're changing history.
[01:37:10.031 --> 01:37:13.957]  I'm not taking credit for more than maybe 5% of it.
[01:37:14.097 --> 01:37:16.821]  It's probably a lot more than that, but it's kind of scary to realize that.
[01:37:17.101 --> 01:37:22.809]  But we actually study the reality, put out the most accurate info we can, no matter how painful it is.
[01:37:23.772 --> 01:37:24.593]  Tell it like it is.
[01:37:24.633 --> 01:37:25.934]  Let the chips fall where they may.
[01:37:26.715 --> 01:37:29.637]  And then, over the years, it gets picked up by others.
[01:37:29.717 --> 01:37:30.358]  They look at it.
[01:37:30.438 --> 01:37:31.219]  They research it.
[01:37:31.759 --> 01:37:32.980]  And then new events happen.
[01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:33.901]  People research it.
[01:37:34.201 --> 01:37:35.282]  They know what to look for.
[01:37:35.943 --> 01:37:37.204]  And boom, the truth comes out.
[01:37:37.664 --> 01:37:40.487]  We knew two days after the underwear bombing that a U.S.
[01:37:40.507 --> 01:37:43.630]  government agency got the drugged Muttalib on the plane.
[01:37:44.150 --> 01:37:48.113]  We had a lawyer and his wife on who were there and saw him put on the plane.
[01:37:48.794 --> 01:37:50.835]  Kurt Haskell was a listener, was aware of False Flag.
[01:37:51.135 --> 01:37:52.396]  He was watching him the whole time.
[01:37:53.137 --> 01:37:56.239]  And later, everything Kurt Haskell said came out in congressional testimony.
[01:37:56.719 --> 01:38:04.305]  Indeed, the CIA put the drugged Muttalib on the plane with a firecracker in his pants as the pretext to roll out all the naked body scanners.
[01:38:04.585 --> 01:38:08.008]  There's just one example of hundreds of things we've broke here.
[01:38:09.969 --> 01:38:12.571]  We break the rebels launching the chemical attack on video.
[01:38:12.951 --> 01:38:16.594]  We're a platform for others expanding on that, like World Net Daily.
[01:38:17.094 --> 01:38:25.920]  I mean, when I realize the amount of stuff we're actually breaking, the amount of things that we're actually paradigm shifting, it is incredible.
[01:38:26.200 --> 01:38:27.621]  And I'm not on a power trip.
[01:38:29.002 --> 01:38:32.465]  I feel unworthy and pathetic every day when I get up here.
[01:38:34.110 --> 01:38:35.391]  That Alex, you've got to cover this.
[01:38:35.531 --> 01:38:36.392]  Oh, you've got to cover that.
[01:38:36.432 --> 01:38:39.634]  And then a guest brings up something and I go, oh my gosh, yeah, I forgot this.
[01:38:39.714 --> 01:38:45.258]  And I mean, it's a train wreck a lot of days, but it's real and people know that.
[01:38:47.065 --> 01:38:48.226]  But this is not scripted.
[01:38:48.266 --> 01:38:51.008]  This is the opposite of teleprompter TV or radio.
[01:38:51.248 --> 01:38:52.969]  This is the opposite of talking points.
[01:38:53.550 --> 01:38:58.814]  This is study history, study the present, study what the globalists want, what they're trying to build.
[01:38:59.354 --> 01:39:01.015]  I want to shift people's paradigm.
[01:39:01.356 --> 01:39:05.499]  Infowarsstore.com, please get PrisonPlanet.tv memberships.
[01:39:06.159 --> 01:39:08.261]  One membership is good for 11 people to use it.

[01:39:22.731 --> 01:39:23.472]  Same URL.
[01:39:23.492 --> 01:39:23.972]  Take you there.
[01:39:24.673 --> 01:39:25.734]  Give gift memberships.
[01:39:26.414 --> 01:39:27.215]  You know, whatever.
[01:39:27.315 --> 01:39:34.260]  The point is, we need your support now more than ever because we're trying to expand.
[01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:39.584]  I know we're having a historical effect for good, so I was up here until 11 o'clock last night.
[01:39:41.684 --> 01:39:51.326]  And I was up here on Saturday, and I was up here late on Friday, and I'm going to continue to come up here seven days a week until we get the official launch of the TV system going.
[01:39:52.386 --> 01:39:57.327]  I've tried, you know, we try to get the personnel in here, we try to get the money in here, but enough of that.
[01:39:57.347 --> 01:39:58.548]  It's just we need your support.
[01:39:58.788 --> 01:40:04.949]  When you buy the books, the videos, the water filters, any of it, it's really a donation, but you get a high quality product at the lowest price.
[01:40:05.589 --> 01:40:10.073]  So again, InfoWarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:40:10.694 --> 01:40:16.519]  Extended clip to make up for all the non-plugging I did in the first hour and what we routinely do here.
[01:40:16.879 --> 01:40:21.783]  The new issue of the magazine's out showing how political correctness is really radical authoritarianism.
[01:40:22.124 --> 01:40:24.886]  Very special issue of InfoWars Magazine for September.
[01:40:25.206 --> 01:40:26.768]  I think probably our best issue so far.
[01:40:26.848 --> 01:40:31.071]  Buy that in bulk at cost or give a gift subscription to friends and family.
[01:40:32.972 --> 01:40:36.314]  Okay, enough plugging that.
[01:40:36.634 --> 01:40:38.755]  Please spread the word about our AM and FM affiliates.
[01:40:39.155 --> 01:40:43.276]  If you're not a local sponsor and you have a business, go become a sponsor of the show locally.
[01:40:43.737 --> 01:40:45.877]  Spread the word if you're a listener about the broadcast.
[01:40:46.238 --> 01:40:48.018]  Thank the sponsors that are on the show.
[01:40:48.318 --> 01:40:49.739]  That is so imperative.
[01:40:50.179 --> 01:40:51.960]  Little things together move mountains.
[01:40:52.340 --> 01:40:53.740]  Big things have small beginnings.
[01:40:54.021 --> 01:40:57.142]  There are hundreds of millions of Patreons worldwide, probably a billion.
[01:40:57.862 --> 01:40:59.243]  Tens of millions in the U.S.
[01:40:59.643 --> 01:41:01.784]  We start taking action, nothing can stop us.
[01:41:02.185 --> 01:41:08.708]  Now, for the balance of the hour, we're joined here by Sean Stone, who really doesn't need any introduction.
[01:41:08.728 --> 01:41:10.569]  He's probably been on the show seven, eight times over the years.
[01:41:11.030 --> 01:41:15.152]  Got a chance to get to know him well, working on the Jesse Ventura last season.
[01:41:16.793 --> 01:41:23.197]  And, of course, also admire a lot of the work his dad's done with films like JFK and so many others.
[01:41:24.244 --> 01:41:30.808]  But his father recently, in fact I forgot to tell you guys to pull the clip up, oh you have it, you remembered, in Japan.
[01:41:31.608 --> 01:41:35.870]  That's not why I got him on, but it's interesting saying Obama is a snake, time to turn on him.
[01:41:36.791 --> 01:41:43.554]  Again, that's something that a lot of the progressives and real liberals don't have the nerve to do, but Sean Stone does.
[01:41:44.595 --> 01:41:52.960]  As really a historian, he's got his award winning series on history, but usually when I get Sean Stone on, it's not about his dad, because he's done a lot of stuff on his own right.
[01:41:54.062 --> 01:41:58.384]  And I'll imagine down the road when my son's doing interviews, he'll be sick of hearing about me.
[01:41:58.424 --> 01:42:02.385]  But that is newsworthy, what your dad has said.
[01:42:02.425 --> 01:42:04.846]  I think that's a good segue into Syria.
[01:42:05.226 --> 01:42:07.287]  Your take on the state of the world, Sean Stone.
[01:42:07.807 --> 01:42:10.988]  What do you make of your father's bold stance and why he said that?
[01:42:12.113 --> 01:42:21.223]  Hey Alex, I think he came to the realization in the course of this history series as to what Obama is really about.
[01:42:21.623 --> 01:42:24.907]  We said it last year, you and I, when we did the Impeach Obama video.
[01:42:27.950 --> 01:42:38.152]  To reiterate the fact, remember in the Impeach Obama video we started out by saying that Congressman Walter Jones said that if Obama commits us to war in Syria without going through Congress, he should be impeached.
[01:42:38.192 --> 01:42:39.113]  And that was one year ago.
[01:42:39.533 --> 01:42:48.595]  So it's important to remind people that we were just on point then and it's still relevant and it's still an important source for people to go to and look at as the Impeach Obama 2012 video.
[01:42:49.475 --> 01:42:51.157]  Or go to impeachobama2012.com.
[01:42:51.477 --> 01:42:58.124]  So I think now even more, one year later, we were a little bit ahead of the curve there, but now even people like my father are coming out and saying it.
[01:42:58.145 --> 01:43:02.149]  I think many people feel that way, more and more probably from both left and right.
[01:43:05.260 --> 01:43:11.107]  You're absolutely right and Walter Jones is coming on later in the week and he does have that bill introduced.
[01:43:11.908 --> 01:43:17.695]  I think this is a sea change moment where the establishment is really being seen for what they are.
[01:43:17.775 --> 01:43:22.641]  Where the public is taking the red pill, are putting on the sunglasses like they live.
[01:43:24.964 --> 01:43:27.186]  Exactly, which we'll get into soon.
[01:43:27.687 --> 01:43:37.017]  Tyrell Ventura, Jesse Ventura's son, and I have been working on this show called Buzzsaw, which we feel is a continuation of Conspiracy Theory.
[01:43:37.698 --> 01:43:45.186]  Because as you know, Tyrell and I took over a lot of the duties on Conspiracy Theory in the last season of doing the interviews while Jesse was unable to travel.
[01:43:45.666 --> 01:43:54.052]  And so now, on Buzzsaw, we kind of do our alternative media, kind of like what you do, with the guests that we want to bring on.
[01:43:54.092 --> 01:43:57.774]  We have interviews, and it's once a week, usually we air on the weekends.
[01:43:58.155 --> 01:44:06.580]  But that's growing and following, and hopefully, the point is that shows like yours, like ours, the alternative media in general, RT's doing a lot of good news.
[01:44:06.900 --> 01:44:11.844]  The point is that people in the United States are just not realizing the fact, the amount that they have been
[01:44:12.444 --> 01:44:15.547]  Let's say, you know, the They Live phenomenon of putting the sunglasses on.
[01:44:15.567 --> 01:44:19.211]  The American people don't realize how much that has occurred to them.
[01:44:19.291 --> 01:44:20.772]  You see, we don't get to travel as easily.
[01:44:20.792 --> 01:44:23.715]  We're cut off from the rest of the world for the most part.
[01:44:24.756 --> 01:44:29.280]  So we don't have that interaction, whereas, you know, in Europe you can travel very easily from country to country within a couple hours.
[01:44:29.841 --> 01:44:31.162]  The Middle East is very close by.
[01:44:31.682 --> 01:44:38.866]  You get access to Russia Today, Al Jazeera, alternative media sources, BBC, that gives different points of view.
[01:44:39.006 --> 01:44:51.253]  Here in America we're very cut off, so I think the point is for the internet, talk shows, and alternative media to get across, to get people another perspective on what's really happening in the world and how much the media really is what controls our perception of reality.
[01:44:51.793 --> 01:44:53.635]  And so we need to become the media.
[01:44:53.996 --> 01:45:03.126]  We need to create art and information and analysis from a truthful perspective to counter the lies.
[01:45:03.186 --> 01:45:05.148]  If we all just start doing it, it's over.
[01:45:05.188 --> 01:45:07.811]  And by the way, I've seen some of your shows on Buzzsaw.
[01:45:08.492 --> 01:45:09.433]  Very, very interesting.
[01:45:09.694 --> 01:45:10.635]  Tell folks about that.
[01:45:11.843 --> 01:45:19.367]  Well, Buzzsaw is sponsored by TheLip.tv, which is an online, I guess you'd say an online studio.
[01:45:19.967 --> 01:45:23.689]  So, TheLip, you know, came to us and just said they're doing talk shows.
[01:45:23.709 --> 01:45:25.990]  They want, you know, talk-oriented content.
[01:45:26.610 --> 01:45:30.792]  And obviously, when it comes to Tyrell Ventura and I, we're very, you know, we're talking to people.
[01:45:30.812 --> 01:45:31.353]  We'll get in there.
[01:45:31.393 --> 01:45:32.753]  We want to talk about conspiracies.
[01:45:32.793 --> 01:45:34.914]  We want to talk about, you know,
[01:45:36.235 --> 01:45:42.700]  The Snowden case and the Bradley Manning case by speaking with Daniel Ellsberg, for example.
[01:45:42.740 --> 01:45:44.921]  We talked to Jeremy Scahill about the 30 wars.
[01:45:45.361 --> 01:45:52.146]  We also even went to the UFO phenomenon and talked to people like Steve Bassett who is sponsoring the Citizens Hearing on Disclosure on aliens bringing 40 plus
[01:45:53.407 --> 01:45:54.468]  Obama is a snake.
[01:46:23.686 --> 01:46:24.288]  He's a snake.
[01:46:25.091 --> 01:46:26.014]  And we have to turn on him.
[01:46:26.034 --> 01:46:28.402]  I know he likes snakes, but...
[01:46:29.740 --> 01:46:31.842]  And that's the short clip.
[01:46:31.882 --> 01:46:33.223]  Everybody's probably seen the long clip.
[01:46:33.243 --> 01:46:34.544]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[01:46:34.845 --> 01:46:35.706]  We played it a few weeks ago.
[01:46:35.726 --> 01:46:42.151]  But the point here is that the reason you've got to turn on Obama is he's the more effective of evils.
[01:46:42.492 --> 01:46:48.797]  He's able to sell the globalist agenda, whereas a stuffy George Bush or Bill Clinton couldn't do it as well.
[01:46:49.538 --> 01:46:52.340]  It's the cult of Obama must be destroyed.
[01:46:52.580 --> 01:46:53.922]  Do you agree with that, Sean Stone?
[01:46:53.942 --> 01:46:56.184]  Let's talk about the latest developments in Syria.
[01:46:57.062 --> 01:46:57.943]  Yeah, 100% I agree.
[01:46:57.963 --> 01:47:07.808]  I think that the point is that he's a great deceiver and that's why people, you know, have called him the anti-Christ or whatnot because he's the one who promises hope and change but he comes from a completely deceptive point.
[01:47:07.848 --> 01:47:16.313]  In fact, you know, we... I believe that he's either under hypnosis or he... I know he... I'm pretty sure, 100% sure he uses hypnosis in his speeches.
[01:47:16.333 --> 01:47:17.173]  Oh, he does NLP.
[01:47:17.193 --> 01:47:17.834]  That's on record.
[01:47:18.234 --> 01:47:18.474]  Yeah, 100%.
[01:47:18.755 --> 01:47:25.180]  But whether or not he himself is hypnotized or under mind control, that's another possibility.
[01:47:25.340 --> 01:47:26.621]  And I'm not entirely sure what he is.
[01:47:26.641 --> 01:47:28.742]  Because to me, Obama is a phenomenon that doesn't exist.
[01:47:29.183 --> 01:47:30.244]  No one quite knows who he is.
[01:47:30.304 --> 01:47:31.444]  No one knows who he is, yeah.
[01:47:32.445 --> 01:47:33.426]  Very mysterious.
[01:47:33.866 --> 01:47:36.629]  Almost like Hitler, if you think about the context.
[01:47:36.709 --> 01:47:38.190]  If someone who had that
[01:47:38.690 --> 01:47:40.932]  Well, again, always they bring foreign entities, don't they?
[01:47:40.992 --> 01:47:51.961]  You know, whether it's Stalin from Georgia taking over Russia, whether it's Napoleon Bonaparte from Corsica taking over France, whether it's Hitler from Austria taking over Germany, Obama, not from the United States, taking over the United States.
[01:47:52.402 --> 01:47:54.544]  It's interesting to see these similarities historically.
[01:47:54.564 --> 01:47:56.825]  But when I say Hitler, I just mean the fact that he had this...
[01:47:57.964 --> 01:48:02.826]  As HIPAA does, Obama has this tremendous ability to make people listen and believe him when he speaks.
[01:48:03.526 --> 01:48:13.989]  And it's a very persuasive form of hypnosis that he uses, and far more dangerous than Bush's, because Bush just was basically a jackass, and he knew it, and he spoke that way, and you knew what it was.
[01:48:14.009 --> 01:48:15.130]  You knew the quantity that it was.
[01:48:15.690 --> 01:48:19.031]  Obama, you don't really know how evil this guy can get.
[01:48:20.148 --> 01:48:20.909]  Very well said.
[01:48:21.650 --> 01:48:31.541]  I see this, though, as the Matrix collapsing, or as I said, putting the sunglasses on, like they live, that we'll talk about with Mr. Piper coming up there in the next hour.
[01:48:32.121 --> 01:48:35.345]  But, I mean, I can't believe that it's all over the news, false flag.
[01:48:35.625 --> 01:48:41.472]  Not just Ron Paul or Rand Paul or Pat Buchanan, but all these other hosts are saying it, and all these analysts are saying it.
[01:48:42.032 --> 01:48:48.360]  Every military officer I talk to, on or off record, says false flag and we don't want to work with Al-Qaeda.
[01:48:48.640 --> 01:48:50.843]  I mean, I've never seen such a rout.
[01:48:51.163 --> 01:48:55.628]  And a month ago, the Pentagon came out and said, we're losing the info war, no one believes us.
[01:48:56.650 --> 01:48:58.211]  I mean, this really is amazing.
[01:48:58.931 --> 01:49:10.796]  I think, you know, Alex, to be honest with you, I think this gives credit to the movement that you, my father, Jesse Ventura, and I, and all what not, you know, I'm a continuation of Tyrell Ventura's continuation of... All of us together!
[01:49:10.816 --> 01:49:24.802]  This has all been building towards is that since the point that we became aware that the New World Order was a real phenomenon, and these guys, you know, have had this long-term agenda of shifting America away from a republic into this kind of imperial police, world policeman, which
[01:49:25.442 --> 01:49:27.844]  Most Americans do not want to see, right?
[01:49:27.904 --> 01:49:30.486]  Any real American doesn't want to see the United States becoming the world's policeman.
[01:49:31.567 --> 01:49:52.405]  As we've seen this New World Order phenomenon, you know, take place, we've been fighting it, you know, there's many others who are fighting the war, and the fact is that as a result, it's like the collective consciousness is kind of, I believe, shifting, and people are starting to wake up, and it's like, fool me once, shame on, you know, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me, and that's where we are now, is at that point of, you know, we're not going to be, you can't keep fooling the American public.
[01:49:54.088 --> 01:49:54.729]  I agree with you.
[01:49:54.789 --> 01:49:58.154]  So what do you expect to happen now, short-term, mid-term, long-term?
[01:49:58.174 --> 01:50:06.365]  I mean, I think they're going to do everything they can to try to put us back in the box, but every angle I look at, there's no way they're going to end up beating us in the end.
[01:50:06.746 --> 01:50:09.370]  It's going to get really nasty, but I don't see them winning.
[01:50:10.751 --> 01:50:11.812]  I don't see them winning.
[01:50:13.674 --> 01:50:21.381]  I believe that what's happened... I think the real motivation behind the Syria war... I mean, if you look at the Syria war from a strategic point of view, it's World War III, right?
[01:50:21.461 --> 01:50:27.026]  I mean, the point is that the Americans say, hey, we're going to hit Syria, and then the Russians say, well, okay, we're going to retaliate against Saudi Arabia.
[01:50:27.586 --> 01:50:29.248]  And the Iranians, you don't know what they're going to do, right?
[01:50:29.268 --> 01:50:31.690]  Will they just arm Hezbollah against Israel or whatnot?
[01:50:31.730 --> 01:50:33.532]  The point is that you get a conflagration.
[01:50:33.752 --> 01:50:40.439]  If the Russians, and without the Chinese, if the Russians alone get involved in the Middle East because of Syria, right?
[01:50:40.939 --> 01:50:42.881]  You have now World War III occurring.
[01:50:43.281 --> 01:50:44.783]  Whether it becomes nuclear or not, we don't know.
[01:50:45.143 --> 01:50:45.563]  Stay there.
[01:50:45.603 --> 01:50:47.124]  Let's talk about what all the experts are saying.
[01:50:47.144 --> 01:50:47.724]  I agree with you.
[01:50:48.105 --> 01:50:50.526]  That's why Dempsey's telling Obama not to do it.
[01:50:50.626 --> 01:50:52.567]  Dempsey's known to be a warmonger, by the way.
[01:50:53.007 --> 01:51:03.513]  They kept getting rid of Chairman to get somebody who'd go along with it, and now Dempsey's getting all the intel and goes, no, because, folks, Assad's going to pull out all those Russian weapons and just start blasting Israel.
[01:51:03.793 --> 01:51:06.875]  Then Israel's going to take the gloves off, and all hell is going to break loose.
[01:51:08.336 --> 01:51:11.819]  For over five years, you've been hearing about the Berkey guy.
[01:51:12.159 --> 01:51:13.961]  So you may know a few things about him.
[01:51:14.241 --> 01:51:20.507]  For example, you are well aware of the superior quality and effectiveness of Berkey water filters and accessories.
[01:51:20.947 --> 01:51:26.192]  But did you know the Berkeys have had independent lab tests done to prove just how effective they are?
[01:51:26.533 --> 01:51:27.013]  It's true!

[01:54:08.731 --> 01:54:13.896]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:14.537 --> 01:54:16.779]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:54:21.960 --> 01:54:29.965]  Sean Stone is our guest, documentary filmmaker, actor, in his own right, obviously, going to work with his father as well, Oliver Stone.
[01:54:30.345 --> 01:54:37.370]  We've got the man, I tell you, since I was a teenager watching they live, I wanted to get Roddy Piper on.
[01:54:38.130 --> 01:54:43.294]  And he's going to be coming on the show, I don't know, for 30, 45 minutes, coming up in the next hour.
[01:54:43.314 --> 01:54:51.620]  And I promise we'll get to the active duty and former military, Steve and John and Will and Mike and Jeff and everybody else that's on here.
[01:54:51.640 --> 01:54:55.603]  We're going to get to you, especially coming up in the next segment or so.
[01:54:55.623 --> 01:54:59.286]  Yeah, because we'll get Piper on at 8 after, because some stations join us then.
[01:54:59.646 --> 01:55:02.628]  So he'll be on with us at the second segment of the next hour.
[01:55:03.109 --> 01:55:04.330]  But going back to Sean Stone,
[01:55:05.896 --> 01:55:06.836]  You know, that same question.
[01:55:07.216 --> 01:55:14.679]  Looking at World War III and how crazy the establishment is, obviously the people above Obama know this is very dangerous.
[01:55:15.179 --> 01:55:16.820]  Why then are they pushing for this?
[01:55:20.141 --> 01:55:29.865]  To my understanding of it, it's more of a... It's like basically the casino is cashed out and they have to decide the best way to evacuate.
[01:55:31.894 --> 01:55:35.857]  You know, how do you basically... The point is that we know the financial system is still, you know, a fraud.
[01:55:36.057 --> 01:55:38.519]  And it's still in chaos, fundamentally.
[01:55:38.559 --> 01:55:40.200]  You know, there's no stability in this.
[01:55:40.260 --> 01:55:42.462]  So a big war is a way to burn down the casino?
[01:55:43.122 --> 01:55:43.663]  Essentially.
[01:55:43.723 --> 01:55:58.433]  I mean, I would say it's... I think it's somewhere between that, there's the mystical element of, you know, the biblical concept of apocalypse and, you know, the idea that we have to have some kind of world war for revelation to occur.
[01:55:58.514 --> 01:55:59.995]  I mean, I think there's a lot of different
[01:56:00.655 --> 01:56:01.676]  Mentality's involved.
[01:56:02.276 --> 01:56:06.478]  Uh, the idea of Nibiru, the planet X, right, is returning, and this is part of, like, the end times.
[01:56:06.958 --> 01:56:17.523]  So, if you formulate all these things together, then yes, it looks like, okay, then World War III is inevitable, but my thinking is that it's not actually inevitable, that we can return gradually to a republic.
[01:56:17.543 --> 01:56:22.986]  I don't think that going back to the republic is going to be an easy thing for the United States to do, because we've gone so far towards this imperial
[01:56:23.786 --> 01:56:38.113]  System of military empire towards the idea of being a national security state total warfare at all times constant fear of terrorism But I believe that if we can stop at least this war from occurring We can step by step gradually bring us back towards where we were which is a republic.
[01:56:38.354 --> 01:56:41.035]  That's you know that's secure within its territory
[01:56:41.315 --> 01:56:48.059]  It's a sense of self that doesn't need to extend out with the British imperial policy of forcing free trade upon countries.
[01:56:48.660 --> 01:56:50.421]  We need to go towards the next form of energy.
[01:56:50.441 --> 01:56:52.702]  I think oil is still a major factor in all of this.
[01:56:53.082 --> 01:56:54.043]  We need to go beyond oil.
[01:56:54.703 --> 01:56:57.265]  We know now cold fusion is realistic and possible.
[01:56:58.025 --> 01:57:05.470]  The Andrea Rossi experiments were even reported about in Forbes magazine that he achieved four times the power of oil that oil generates.
[01:57:07.111 --> 01:57:08.153]  Through his machine.
[01:57:08.574 --> 01:57:10.817]  So, I mean, you're talking between fission, fusion processes.
[01:57:10.837 --> 01:57:20.534]  We have to get beyond this oil thing and then already you're going to see our attention is going to shift away from the Middle East and these wars there which are really natural gas and oil based as far as the economy is concerned.
[01:57:22.150 --> 01:57:24.091]  And they're trying to shift into Asia.
[01:57:24.592 --> 01:57:31.857]  I just see the globalists above all the nations playing them off against each other, and I know that's really a simplistic way to put it, but that's what globalism is.
[01:57:32.778 --> 01:57:44.867]  I just think spiritually the controllers are blind because they know how to manipulate reality, but they have knowledge to manipulate it, but they don't look 20 steps down how it's going to affect their own progeny.
[01:57:45.347 --> 01:57:56.430]  And they think that they are immune from all the sins they commit against humanity, when all common sense and knowledge shows, it will all come back on them.
[01:57:57.210 --> 01:57:59.630]  Well, you know, this is a very interesting discussion.
[01:57:59.670 --> 01:58:01.771]  Again, this gets more to the spiritual side of things.
[01:58:02.431 --> 01:58:14.354]  As far as I, you know, from people I've seen within the families, let's say, oftentimes the people, the kids who are born to these satanic cults and whatnot, because that's really what they were talking about at the highest level, is that essentially it's a form of satanism.
[01:58:15.114 --> 01:58:15.795]  And ego worship.
[01:58:15.875 --> 01:58:24.202]  And the ego worship would basically, like some of the classic Greek myths, the father would eat his own son, right?
[01:58:24.562 --> 01:58:30.287]  The kids will be sacrificed for the sake of the family, for the ruler, for the father not willing to sacrifice his position.
[01:58:31.028 --> 01:58:31.989]  And that's maybe what you're looking at.
[01:58:32.540 --> 01:58:35.382]  Yeah, no, that's like the emperor wanting to kill Darth Vader at the end.
[01:58:35.883 --> 01:58:39.185]  It's like always killing the next generation, the oligarch view.
[01:58:39.446 --> 01:58:44.189]  We're gonna come back five more minutes with you, and then you're gonna ride shotgun with Rowdy Piper coming up.
[01:58:44.249 --> 01:58:45.510]  I'm really excited about this.
[01:58:48.313 --> 01:58:50.134]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:58:57.745 --> 01:59:01.387]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us?
[01:59:01.627 --> 01:59:06.910]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[01:59:07.130 --> 01:59:14.694]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[01:59:14.874 --> 01:59:23.979]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[01:59:24.179 --> 01:59:31.165]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[01:59:31.345 --> 01:59:34.207]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[01:59:34.227 --> 01:59:41.133]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse, but demand a war.

[02:00:17.261 --> 02:00:18.081]  You want answers?
[02:00:18.862 --> 02:00:19.742]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:20.403 --> 02:00:24.005]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:24.585 --> 02:00:28.668]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:37.461 --> 02:00:41.164]  Rowdy Roddy Piper is minutes away from Sean Stone's house.
[02:00:41.565 --> 02:00:42.726]  He got stuck in traffic.
[02:00:43.286 --> 02:00:46.269]  But that's fine, because he's not supposed to be on to the next segment, so that's coming up.
[02:00:46.729 --> 02:00:48.271]  25th anniversary of They Live.
[02:00:48.671 --> 02:00:52.274]  Sean Stone, director, researcher, talk show host, is our guest.
[02:00:52.354 --> 02:00:53.936]  I will get to all the people that are holding.
[02:00:54.316 --> 02:00:55.577]  If you can't hold, that's fine.
[02:00:55.597 --> 02:00:56.058]  You can hang up.
[02:00:56.118 --> 02:00:56.918]  I won't get mad at you.
[02:00:56.938 --> 02:01:02.823]  But I want to hear from active duty or former military about the open funding of Al Qaeda and what your take is on that.
[02:01:03.504 --> 02:01:07.210]  But Sean, I know that you went to some of the most elite universities.
[02:01:07.890 --> 02:01:11.355]  You've been around the Hollywood elite big time, your dad obviously being Oliver Stone.
[02:01:11.696 --> 02:01:14.059]  You yourself, is it something like 30 movies you've been in?
[02:01:14.079 --> 02:01:15.842]  A lot of them, some of the biggest out there.
[02:01:16.223 --> 02:01:17.905]  When you talk about satanic cults...
[02:01:18.786 --> 02:01:21.167]  And, you know, not in your family, but stuff you've seen.
[02:01:21.627 --> 02:01:23.508]  And you talk about this Illuminati.
[02:01:23.588 --> 02:01:29.451]  You know, I mean, I know you've told me stuff off record that, I mean, you were just getting into all that.
[02:01:29.531 --> 02:01:32.573]  What can you tell people about Hollywood and the government?
[02:01:33.153 --> 02:01:37.115]  And what percentage of them would you say are practicing Illuminati satanist?
[02:01:39.692 --> 02:01:47.699]  Well, honestly, Alex, this has been kind of a lifetime's endeavor of constantly, you know, deepening my knowledge and trying to understand better.
[02:01:47.739 --> 02:01:59.588]  Because, you know, as you know, oftentimes when you talk to people who have been through very terrible things as children, you know, whether it be satanic ritual abuse, for example, sexual abuse, things like this,
[02:02:01.169 --> 02:02:03.930]  It's hard to know at what level they've been traumatized.
[02:02:03.990 --> 02:02:08.130]  At what point are they fictionalizing or fantasizing things?
[02:02:08.551 --> 02:02:09.551]  And at what level are they real?
[02:02:10.251 --> 02:02:13.752]  As you know, it's a long discussion.
[02:02:13.772 --> 02:02:14.952]  It's a very difficult thing to get into.
[02:02:15.032 --> 02:02:21.313]  My belief, though, fundamentally is, look, I was watching the Keeping Up With The Kardashians last night because I've never seen the show.
[02:02:21.913 --> 02:02:25.834]  And I'm just curious to know why a satanic family like that is being put on the air so blatantly.
[02:02:26.673 --> 02:02:27.995]  Because if you think about it, that's what it is.
[02:02:28.475 --> 02:02:34.262]  To have kids, or not kids, but adults, talking so openly and blatantly about sex in front of their mother.
[02:02:34.683 --> 02:02:43.273]  But I guess the point is, the mother herself, as far as I'm told, actually filmed Kim Kardashian, her daughter, having sex with this guy when that porn video was filmed by the mother.
[02:02:43.734 --> 02:02:44.615]  And you start to think, wait...
[02:02:45.717 --> 02:02:47.058]  Isn't that what Satanism really is?
[02:02:47.838 --> 02:02:50.360]  Isn't it that exploitation of your own children?
[02:02:50.460 --> 02:03:00.786]  Isn't it the idea of being able to have no limitations, have no boundaries, as far as making money and profiting off of your loved ones, especially your children?
[02:03:00.986 --> 02:03:02.067]  Isn't that the worst crime of all?
[02:03:02.287 --> 02:03:02.607]  Yeah, I know.
[02:03:02.627 --> 02:03:03.949]  It's about betrayal.
[02:03:04.189 --> 02:03:07.913]  And I see that spirit actually growing in the world, but also the spirit of good is growing.
[02:03:08.214 --> 02:03:10.196]  For every action there's an equal or opposite reaction.
[02:03:10.436 --> 02:03:16.143]  Where people get into betraying you, even though it's not even good for them in business, they can't help it.
[02:03:16.804 --> 02:03:16.984]  Right.
[02:03:17.404 --> 02:03:17.584]  Right.
[02:03:17.844 --> 02:03:19.445]  Because there's a cycle and you have to keep feeding it.
[02:03:19.885 --> 02:03:25.566]  That's I think where America is at that kind of point where we've been feeding, we've been feeding on other countries, we've been feeding on the third world.
[02:03:25.626 --> 02:03:29.807]  We have no problem, you know, that imperial demon that was really from the British.
[02:03:29.847 --> 02:03:37.289]  I did an interview on Buzzsaw with Douglas Dietrich who was a guy who worked with Michael Aquino, the very famous satanic colonel in the military.
[02:03:37.329 --> 02:03:38.949]  He was the head of the Temple of Set, right?
[02:03:39.249 --> 02:03:42.830]  Now, Army PSYOPS commander was an open Satanist, yeah?
[02:03:42.850 --> 02:03:51.772]  Yes, and there were all kinds of allegations against him and charges against him for sexually abusing, satanically, children at the Presidio Army Base, right, in San Francisco.
[02:03:52.333 --> 02:04:00.255]  And Dietrich worked with Aquino, and he claims that Aquino was, in fact, involved in that ring and satanic abuse of children.
[02:04:00.755 --> 02:04:04.436]  And Dietrich said to me that Aquino
[02:04:05.765 --> 02:04:13.973]  told him that they had unleashed the British Empire and unleashed certain demons in the course of John Dee's reign with Queen Elizabeth.
[02:04:14.053 --> 02:04:20.418]  John Dee was one of the top counselors to Queen Elizabeth, really the originator of the British intelligence services of the modern era.
[02:04:20.979 --> 02:04:27.985]  Dee, as we know, and his partner, Kelly, were very involved in magic rituals and practices.
[02:04:28.726 --> 02:04:39.429]  These guys, Aquino and whatnot, the Satanic crew now said that they unleashed demons on the British Empire for the British Empire to expand, to make deals with these demons basically for the British Empire to have its power and technology.
[02:04:40.049 --> 02:04:49.012]  And as a result, the Americans now are using those same demons and trying to keep feeding them with more wars and more blood in order to maintain their power and control.
[02:04:50.293 --> 02:04:59.060]  So, whether that's in reality true or not, these people believe they're being given basically extraterrestrial, beyond human advanced intelligence advice.
[02:04:59.600 --> 02:05:00.841]  And that goes back to the book of Enoch.
[02:05:01.282 --> 02:05:01.642]  Look at it.
[02:05:01.902 --> 02:05:03.123]  Sure, the whole Bible's about that.
[02:05:03.403 --> 02:05:05.165]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:05:05.185 --> 02:05:06.266]  Sean Stone's our guest.

[02:08:12.709 --> 02:08:18.172]  There is a signal broadcast every second of every day through our television sets.
[02:08:18.752 --> 02:08:20.313]  Even when the set is turned off.
[02:08:21.113 --> 02:08:23.494]  Our impulses are being redirected.
[02:08:24.095 --> 02:08:29.577]  We are living in an artificially induced state of consciousness that resembles sleep.
[02:08:29.677 --> 02:08:32.299]  The poor and the underclass are growing.
[02:08:32.919 --> 02:08:36.261]  Racial justice and human rights are non-existent.
[02:08:37.002 --> 02:08:43.006]  They have created a repressive society and we are their unwitting accomplices.
[02:08:43.546 --> 02:08:48.189]  Their intention to rule rests with the annihilation of consciousness.
[02:08:48.789 --> 02:08:51.451]  We have been lulled into a trance.
[02:08:51.611 --> 02:08:55.634]  They have made us indifferent to ourselves, to others.
[02:08:56.154 --> 02:08:58.776]  We are focused only on our own gain.
[02:09:00.034 --> 02:09:03.576]  Keep us asleep, keep us selfish, keep us sedated.
[02:09:04.537 --> 02:09:07.779]  They are dismantling the sleeping middle class.
[02:09:08.300 --> 02:09:10.861]  More and more people are becoming poor.
[02:09:11.502 --> 02:09:12.743]  We are their cattle.
[02:09:13.203 --> 02:09:16.425]  We are being bred for slavery.
[02:09:17.186 --> 02:09:19.027]  They want benign indifference.
[02:09:19.507 --> 02:09:20.728]  They want us drugged.
[02:09:21.483 --> 02:09:22.703]  We could be pets.
[02:09:23.023 --> 02:09:23.963]  We could be food.
[02:09:24.564 --> 02:09:27.024]  But all we really are is livestock.
[02:09:27.184 --> 02:09:29.324]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[02:09:29.785 --> 02:09:32.365]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:09:32.825 --> 02:09:35.206]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:09:37.906 --> 02:09:47.648]  Alright folks, we're brought in with a little bit of the theme music from They Live.
[02:09:48.715 --> 02:09:51.736]  The really good part is where it goes, dum-dum, dump, dump.
[02:09:52.356 --> 02:09:58.778]  But I tell ya, it is one of my favorite all-time movies, and it really gets you to think outside the box.
[02:09:58.858 --> 02:10:02.119]  And of course, I grew up watching him on television as well.
[02:10:02.459 --> 02:10:07.341]  It's super exciting to have Rowdy Rydie Piper on with us today.
[02:10:08.181 --> 02:10:09.522]  Thank you very much for having me.
[02:10:09.542 --> 02:10:12.564]  Would you mind just introducing me every place I go?
[02:10:13.044 --> 02:10:13.724]  Fantastic introduction.
[02:10:38.749 --> 02:10:39.730]  Well, it's great to have you on.
[02:10:39.770 --> 02:10:42.691]  I tell you, so much is happening in the world, but let's get into They Live.
[02:10:42.711 --> 02:10:48.094]  You've been in a lot of movies, but what's your take on the 25th anniversary of They Live?
[02:10:51.415 --> 02:10:53.056]  It's really interesting.
[02:10:54.830 --> 02:10:58.851]  The movie They Live, when it was made, was more about Reaganomics at the time.
[02:10:59.771 --> 02:11:10.713]  But with the, uh, as the music lulls you to sleep, conspiracies, one of the things that the movie has done is it's taken on a life of its own.
[02:11:12.493 --> 02:11:18.054]  It never gets old as we see the world evolve and try to make us a little chip.
[02:11:19.735 --> 02:11:21.915]  The same thing's happening over and over again.
[02:11:22.495 --> 02:11:27.837]  You watch They Live and it gives you, it's kind of like the cliff notes for what's going on.
[02:11:29.158 --> 02:11:30.098]  Well, it certainly is.
[02:11:30.138 --> 02:11:34.740]  I mean, you've got the part where the drone flies over you and you go, hello there, my little friend.
[02:11:34.760 --> 02:11:41.683]  And now I've actually videotaped drones twice in Austin watching people at the park.
[02:11:41.763 --> 02:11:43.604]  Now I'm actually living in They Live.
[02:11:44.484 --> 02:11:49.706]  Yes, and it's an awkward place to live, I'll be honest with you.
[02:11:49.726 --> 02:11:59.830]  You know, John Carpenter, when we shot this scene with the homeless people, he actually used the homeless people there.
[02:11:59.910 --> 02:12:00.991]  John is a big activist.
[02:12:01.451 --> 02:12:03.512]  You know, and I give them all the respect in the world for that.
[02:12:04.413 --> 02:12:09.196]  And, you know, turning out and showing what the world has become.
[02:12:09.236 --> 02:12:11.257]  I don't know why America has homeless people.
[02:12:12.618 --> 02:12:13.278]  It's terrible.
[02:12:13.318 --> 02:12:19.622]  But also another thing we had to do was pay off the gangs so they wouldn't come and wreck our trailers.
[02:12:19.662 --> 02:12:24.004]  So there was, you know, little conspiracy, little gangs for
[02:12:25.285 --> 02:12:36.231]  Warfare, then there would be the homeless people we take care of, and it really became a venture of love to a certain point and trying to do the right thing.
[02:12:36.671 --> 02:12:38.952]  Again, I give all the credit to John on that.
[02:12:41.193 --> 02:12:44.395]  What is your favorite part of the film?
[02:12:44.415 --> 02:12:47.356]  Well, not the fight, I'll tell you that.
[02:12:47.396 --> 02:12:50.378]  That was a long fight.
[02:12:51.058 --> 02:12:52.239]  My favorite part of the film?
[02:12:54.451 --> 02:13:01.747]  I think when the character Nada looks up and he says, uh, I believe in America.
[02:13:03.181 --> 02:13:08.164]  Um, I think that's probably the biggest statement of the entire movie.
[02:13:09.065 --> 02:13:22.832]  Uh, one thing for instance, when we would go to press conferences, you know, if you happen to be wearing something like a Rolex, we'd took it off or, you know, we'd, John and I both drive Cadillacs trying to buy America, buy American and keep the country safe.
[02:13:24.033 --> 02:13:31.878]  Uh, and in that shot, you had all the skyline of Los Angeles and, uh, the character Nada
[02:13:32.614 --> 02:13:34.915]  Which means nothing, obviously, which means nothing.
[02:13:36.196 --> 02:13:44.021]  The thing that was interesting with Nada staring over the LA skyline was you didn't know anything about him.
[02:13:44.041 --> 02:13:45.542]  You didn't know where he came from.
[02:13:45.562 --> 02:13:46.763]  He wore a wedding ring.
[02:13:46.783 --> 02:13:47.684]  You didn't know why.
[02:13:47.944 --> 02:13:49.285]  You didn't know where he was going.
[02:13:49.305 --> 02:13:59.111]  He's that lost American wandering around and he still looks out over the skyline of Los Angeles and he says a very profound statement.
[02:13:59.531 --> 02:14:00.652]  I believe in America.
[02:14:01.494 --> 02:14:01.994]  I do, too.
[02:14:03.295 --> 02:14:03.896]  Absolutely.
[02:14:03.916 --> 02:14:10.781]  You know, one of my favorite lines is, because I feel like this all the time trying to politically awaken people that they're being lied to, that there's an agenda.
[02:14:11.301 --> 02:14:12.282]  It's not left or right.
[02:14:12.342 --> 02:14:14.504]  It's, hey, there's mind control going on.
[02:14:14.804 --> 02:14:18.006]  The signal's broadcast 24 hours a day through all this media.
[02:14:18.326 --> 02:14:21.068]  Just become aware of it and they'll say, there's nothing going on.
[02:14:21.289 --> 02:14:25.432]  And I want to say, put on these glasses or start chewing concrete.
[02:14:27.413 --> 02:14:28.053]  Without a doubt.
[02:14:30.556 --> 02:14:32.337]  By the way, I'm a big booster of you.
[02:14:33.298 --> 02:14:40.705]  I've watched some of your taking care of America and watched you in the hotel room while the buzzing was going on.
[02:14:41.066 --> 02:14:42.607]  I think you do a terrific job.
[02:14:42.947 --> 02:14:47.291]  This is the kind of thing that needs to be exposed to America.
[02:14:48.192 --> 02:14:48.893]  They need to know.
[02:14:48.913 --> 02:14:50.615]  They're trying to put us to sleep.
[02:14:50.735 --> 02:14:51.556]  I'm a born rebel.
[02:14:52.236 --> 02:14:53.937]  I can't help myself.
[02:14:53.977 --> 02:14:55.138]  I think Sean might be too.
[02:14:55.338 --> 02:14:59.060]  Rowdy, Rowdy, Roddy Piper is a born rebel?
[02:14:59.100 --> 02:14:59.981]  You gotta be kidding.
[02:15:00.181 --> 02:15:01.342]  Best guess.
[02:15:01.822 --> 02:15:02.983]  Best guess at it, bud.
[02:15:04.403 --> 02:15:06.064]  You know, I've got four children.
[02:15:07.986 --> 02:15:09.226]  All born here in America.
[02:15:09.707 --> 02:15:11.268]  I've got two son-in-laws.
[02:15:11.848 --> 02:15:12.929]  One of my son-in-laws
[02:15:13.649 --> 02:15:15.772]  There's a captain in the army who's been wounded twice.
[02:15:16.533 --> 02:15:18.075]  By the son-in-law of the Green Beret.
[02:15:18.596 --> 02:15:23.303]  You know, with Bay Live and the mind control and everything that's going on, there's one thing that, uh...
[02:15:24.639 --> 02:15:25.779]  That can escape people.
[02:15:25.819 --> 02:15:35.242]  If you don't have somebody personal to you that has been harmed by the conspiracies and all the tributaries that lead to that or run off that.
[02:15:35.742 --> 02:15:46.044]  If you don't have someone close to you shaking at night time because he got blown up twice, went over again and got blown up two times, then it doesn't mean so much to you.
[02:15:46.745 --> 02:15:49.825]  You know, every time we want to go to war, send your boy to war.
[02:15:50.626 --> 02:15:51.826]  My boy's already been there.
[02:15:52.617 --> 02:16:06.045]  And it becomes with the mind control, trying to dumb down the society, drugging society, putting stuff, I mean, it's a major, major conspiracy for a new world order.
[02:16:06.405 --> 02:16:10.508]  There's no doubt about it in my, excuse me, in my humble opinion.
[02:16:11.248 --> 02:16:15.151]  There's no doubt about it that the world is trying to evolve into something.
[02:16:15.651 --> 02:16:18.593]  Rowdy, Rowdy, Rowdy Piper, I'm sorry I interrupted.
[02:16:18.833 --> 02:16:21.955]  What do you think, what do you think they're trying to evolve it into?
[02:16:23.712 --> 02:16:35.197]  Well, this, again, I respect you and what you're doing, and Sean, your opinions are much... No, no, we want to know yours.
[02:16:35.237 --> 02:16:36.278]  Don't be humble, sir.
[02:16:36.318 --> 02:16:41.580]  Okay, well, no, but you're much more educated on this than I am, and I don't want to... This is too serious.
[02:16:42.060 --> 02:16:45.662]  I don't want to... This is just my humble opinion.
[02:16:45.822 --> 02:16:46.122]  Sure.
[02:16:46.682 --> 02:16:49.504]  The world has to go someplace, okay?
[02:16:49.544 --> 02:16:52.065]  We've got so many countries around the world fighting.
[02:16:53.986 --> 02:16:59.169]  That the world has to get together in some kind of way, in some kind of fashion.
[02:16:59.609 --> 02:17:02.110]  Instead of killing people, killing children for oil.
[02:17:04.532 --> 02:17:14.938]  One idea that crossed my mind was, as soon as they let us see the aliens, we'll all get together because it'll be us against them.
[02:17:15.898 --> 02:17:18.860]  And you need some kind of shock value like that.
[02:17:19.881 --> 02:17:21.422]  Either that or we're going to self-destruct.
[02:17:23.003 --> 02:17:30.287]  I think that in all cultures, people are basically very good-hearted.
[02:17:30.828 --> 02:17:34.030]  It's just the extremists are the people that are running and pushing the buttons.
[02:17:35.311 --> 02:17:42.615]  I think that they want one governmental force to govern the world.
[02:17:43.976 --> 02:17:46.238]  It's just that everybody's got their own agenda.
[02:17:46.778 --> 02:17:49.079]  You can't get that done unless Gandhi's around.
[02:17:49.400 --> 02:17:49.880]  You can't.
[02:17:51.952 --> 02:17:54.093]  We can't get everybody on the same page.
[02:17:54.674 --> 02:17:57.576]  Another idea is if we all spoke the same language.
[02:17:58.136 --> 02:17:59.037]  It'd be kind of cool.
[02:17:59.057 --> 02:18:01.118]  Because communication is gone.
[02:18:01.138 --> 02:18:04.120]  And then you can't tell when they say obey.
[02:18:04.660 --> 02:18:06.561]  You know, we were mad at Russia for how long?
[02:18:06.601 --> 02:18:07.642]  But I've been there.
[02:18:08.182 --> 02:18:09.283]  And they're pretty nice people.
[02:18:09.763 --> 02:18:12.545]  They don't want to go over the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[02:18:13.086 --> 02:18:16.648]  If you go back and look at it, Russia didn't want to start a nuclear war.
[02:18:18.797 --> 02:18:20.217]  Pretty good people around the world.
[02:18:20.737 --> 02:18:23.098]  So, what is the world trying to evolve to?
[02:18:23.858 --> 02:18:30.759]  We have so many different people, and there's zero population has not, uh, has not happened yet.
[02:18:31.019 --> 02:18:33.840]  And we're growing and growing like... China!
[02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:35.060]  What are you doing, China?
[02:18:35.360 --> 02:18:36.280]  The thing in Syria.
[02:18:36.840 --> 02:18:37.821]  What's China doing?
[02:18:38.541 --> 02:18:39.841]  Why are we sending our boys?
[02:18:41.301 --> 02:18:42.582]  Somebody else sending their boys.
[02:18:42.622 --> 02:18:43.562]  What's the UN doing?
[02:18:43.862 --> 02:18:44.522]  So what, what...
[02:18:45.458 --> 02:18:47.019]  What do I believe is trying to happen?
[02:18:47.039 --> 02:18:56.988]  I believe that a lot of people with their own agendas are trying to come around and make one government to govern the entire world.
[02:18:57.829 --> 02:18:59.190]  And there's some things they're going to have to do.
[02:18:59.230 --> 02:19:04.896]  We all got to speak the same language and we all got to be sincere about what's going on and not so greedy.
[02:19:05.951 --> 02:19:10.212]  Absolutely, because you can have the Star Trek idea of a one world government, everybody's nice.
[02:19:10.672 --> 02:19:16.974]  The problem is the people running the global government are not nice people and they want control.
[02:19:17.774 --> 02:19:20.455]  Basically, I use the they live analogy.
[02:19:20.475 --> 02:19:23.876]  We'll come back to break and get your take on this, both of you.
[02:19:24.936 --> 02:19:29.239]  As the globalists are like psychopaths that are building a psychopathic world government.
[02:19:29.559 --> 02:19:37.905]  So the allegory of them being space aliens and they live is absolutely accurate because these aren't like regular people and they punch our emotional buttons.
[02:19:38.245 --> 02:19:41.608]  They punch our human buttons to cold-bloodedly control us.
[02:19:41.648 --> 02:19:49.453]  So how do we learn how the psychopaths operate so we're aware of their tricks so as good people we can come together and not blow the planet up.
[02:19:49.473 --> 02:19:53.236]  We're going to come right back with our amazing guest, both of our guests Sean Stone and
[02:19:53.556 --> 02:19:55.239]  Rowdy Roddy Piper.
[02:19:55.499 --> 02:20:02.831]  Straight ahead it's the 25th anniversary of They Live and I'm told the DVDs are selling off the stores like hotcakes.
[02:20:03.152 --> 02:20:04.053]  We'll be right back.
[02:20:05.015 --> 02:20:05.616]  We'll be right back.
[02:20:07.816 --> 02:20:09.898]  Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins.
[02:20:10.158 --> 02:20:16.444]  Amino acids have to be delivered to your body in the shape that nature gave them, if they are to be used to create new proteins in your body.
[02:20:16.785 --> 02:20:24.793]  Just like a bricklayer cannot use bent or twisted bricks to build a brick wall, so too your body cannot use bent or twisted amino acids to build new proteins.
[02:20:25.293 --> 02:20:29.415]  Giving your body an undamaged amino acid food can make a huge difference in your health.
[02:20:30.075 --> 02:20:33.936]  One World Way is an undamaged amino acid food unlike any other.
[02:20:34.216 --> 02:20:36.517]  You see, heating bends and twists amino acids.
[02:20:36.777 --> 02:20:41.959]  And all whey protein powders we've investigated, and most proteins you consume, are heated.
[02:20:42.340 --> 02:20:45.841]  With our TrueCool process, you now have a choice with One World Way.
[02:20:46.241 --> 02:20:47.141]  My name is Daniel.
[02:20:47.261 --> 02:20:48.422]  I'm 34 years old.
[02:20:48.482 --> 02:20:52.203]  When I started using One World Away, I weighed 228 pounds.
[02:20:52.383 --> 02:20:56.004]  Now, after two and a half months, I weigh 182 pounds.
[02:20:56.124 --> 02:20:57.264]  This is my ideal weight.
[02:20:57.444 --> 02:21:02.106]  I've noticed an increase in stamina, rate of recovery from workouts, and an increase in my potency.

[02:22:38.015 --> 02:22:42.317]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:22:42.497 --> 02:22:48.078]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:22:48.198 --> 02:22:51.539]  Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:22:51.759 --> 02:22:54.320]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[02:23:06.263 --> 02:23:10.365]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[02:23:11.045 --> 02:23:13.166]  I want you to know some very important information.
[02:23:14.066 --> 02:23:22.409]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[02:23:23.029 --> 02:23:27.951]  Now, 27 years later, carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

[02:24:15.046 --> 02:24:22.702]  Look at your young men biting Look at your women crying Look at your young men
[02:24:23.686 --> 02:24:34.311]  Folks, what I'll do is, tomorrow, we'll open the phones up for all the folks that we're calling in, as I got behind today, and get military members' take on the Syria situation.
[02:24:34.571 --> 02:24:36.111]  We already covered that the last two hours.
[02:24:36.772 --> 02:24:40.093]  Right now, we're getting into consciousness and how to get people out of the Matrix.
[02:24:40.653 --> 02:24:45.936]  And films like The Matrix, and films like They Live, do that like no other films can.
[02:24:47.197 --> 02:24:52.663]  And we, of course, have Sean Stone and Mr. Piper on the broadcast with us.
[02:24:53.383 --> 02:24:55.726]  And I'm very honored to have both of them on the show.
[02:24:55.746 --> 02:25:00.031]  I'm a big fan of the movie They Live, but also of Rowdy Roddy Piper.
[02:25:00.071 --> 02:25:02.233]  You can go to his website.
[02:25:02.513 --> 02:25:04.756]  We'll put it up on screen for TV viewers.
[02:25:04.816 --> 02:25:07.238]  It is rowdyroddypiper.com.
[02:25:08.920 --> 02:25:10.201]  And it's a really great site.
[02:25:10.241 --> 02:25:13.843]  It has a lot of really interesting information up there on it.
[02:25:14.143 --> 02:25:18.445]  And he also has his Twitter, which we'll put up on screen for TV viewers.
[02:25:18.925 --> 02:25:23.908]  But for radio listeners, you can simply go to the address.
[02:25:23.928 --> 02:25:25.648]  Have you guys put his Twitter up on screen?
[02:25:25.688 --> 02:25:27.409]  It's on that computer right there.
[02:25:28.090 --> 02:25:32.812]  And folks can go there and check that out as well.
[02:25:33.592 --> 02:25:36.514]  But guys, continuing with where we left off.
[02:25:37.114 --> 02:25:38.094]  about consciousness.
[02:25:38.154 --> 02:25:41.516]  It's R underscore Roddy underscore Piper.
[02:25:41.576 --> 02:25:49.058]  It's at R underscore Roddy underscore Piper or rowdyroddypiper.com as I said.
[02:25:50.739 --> 02:25:53.680]  Where do you see the whole world going currently?
[02:25:53.700 --> 02:25:57.761]  We were talking about globalism, the new world order, the things that are happening.
[02:25:58.101 --> 02:26:02.243]  Do you have hope for your children and your grandchildren?
[02:26:04.042 --> 02:26:04.302]  Oof.
[02:26:04.902 --> 02:26:07.363]  I guess I'm the only one who's got children between the two of us, huh?
[02:26:08.444 --> 02:26:14.185]  Um, I'm actually, I'm a little afraid for my, uh, for my youngest.
[02:26:14.265 --> 02:26:19.107]  I've got four children, the most beautiful children in the world, in my opinion.
[02:26:19.627 --> 02:26:25.709]  And, uh, the youngest, uh, just is going to PSU to become a doctor.
[02:26:25.729 --> 02:26:25.769]  Um,
[02:26:28.197 --> 02:26:29.818]  And they're all over this kind of thing.
[02:26:29.878 --> 02:26:30.738]  She's very aware.
[02:26:31.239 --> 02:26:32.599]  Fallon is my youngest.
[02:26:32.699 --> 02:26:33.440]  She's 18 years old.
[02:26:33.820 --> 02:26:37.102]  She's very aware of what's going on in the world.
[02:26:37.122 --> 02:26:49.909]  The internet, you know, I'm from the generation before computers and the internet's got so much information that the thing is,
[02:26:51.058 --> 02:26:53.959]  The kids, they're targeting the kids.
[02:26:55.580 --> 02:26:58.361]  And they're telling them how to think.
[02:26:58.421 --> 02:26:59.721]  They're dumbing them down in school.
[02:26:59.741 --> 02:27:04.423]  For instance, when my kids were in school, they had like no paper days.
[02:27:05.003 --> 02:27:07.444]  They didn't have paper to write on because of a shortage.
[02:27:07.965 --> 02:27:09.205]  Or they'd pull the teachers.
[02:27:10.045 --> 02:27:13.307]  And that's a real heat getter for a dad who makes a living
[02:27:14.628 --> 02:27:16.469]  Uh, wrestling with his body.
[02:27:17.771 --> 02:27:23.176]  When I go to feed my family, and all of a sudden you've got a school that has no paper for my kids.
[02:27:24.177 --> 02:27:25.659]  So why do you have no paper?
[02:27:25.699 --> 02:27:28.341]  Well, you see, it all starts...
[02:27:29.522 --> 02:27:30.242]  With the kids.
[02:27:30.983 --> 02:27:33.824]  And as you get older and a little wiser, you're harder to fool.
[02:27:34.484 --> 02:27:37.545]  But you put up another pop idol for the kids.
[02:27:38.526 --> 02:27:48.470]  Put up another piece of music that maybe isn't, is nothing but vulgarity for the kids.
[02:27:48.990 --> 02:27:50.291]  You know, bang it into them.
[02:27:51.191 --> 02:27:55.153]  You know, I can remember, I think you know the Brunswick Affair probably, Alan.
[02:27:55.433 --> 02:27:55.793]  Oh yes.
[02:27:56.173 --> 02:28:04.195]  Yeah, and for those who don't know about the Brunswick Affair, very quickly, about, I think, early 60s, they had a TV called the Brunswick.
[02:28:04.835 --> 02:28:14.078]  And the people that bought it, Dad would go to work, Mom would be there, and Dad would come back home, and all of a sudden she bought 20 pounds of dog food.
[02:28:14.438 --> 02:28:15.398]  But they don't have a dog.
[02:28:16.246 --> 02:28:19.708]  And they found out that there was a little button in the TV called the Brunswick.
[02:28:20.529 --> 02:28:25.633]  And when the commercials came on, they did something that shot out these waves and made you buy.
[02:28:26.413 --> 02:28:28.194]  That's in the early 60s.
[02:28:28.715 --> 02:28:31.096]  Can you imagine how sophisticated they are now?
[02:28:32.157 --> 02:28:32.938]  Holy cow!
[02:28:33.598 --> 02:28:39.902]  So, if they had that kind of mind control back then... The only reason I think that I'm not...
[02:28:41.866 --> 02:28:43.706]  I'm not a good case study for them.
[02:28:43.726 --> 02:28:46.707]  It's because I was a born gypsy.
[02:28:47.127 --> 02:28:49.488]  I don't really have, there's no place to halter me.
[02:28:49.928 --> 02:28:51.969]  And I'm not afraid to speak out.
[02:28:53.169 --> 02:28:55.930]  But they're my children.
[02:28:56.510 --> 02:28:58.450]  And you say, what do I worry about my children?
[02:28:58.790 --> 02:29:00.451]  And I have five grandchildren.
[02:29:01.251 --> 02:29:04.732]  And I'm very worried about them because the earth is not stable right now.
[02:29:06.463 --> 02:29:11.885]  Absolutely, because it's being run by control freak psychopaths that might as well be space aliens from another planet.
[02:29:12.505 --> 02:29:14.786]  And you raise the whole point about mind control.
[02:29:15.146 --> 02:29:20.087]  In the 40s, they would put subliminal ads in movie theaters and double sales of Coca-Cola.
[02:29:20.627 --> 02:29:22.188]  And now it's so much more high-tech.
[02:29:22.828 --> 02:29:28.012]  And it's working on the zombified public, but there is a minority that it actually has the opposite effect on.
[02:29:28.032 --> 02:29:37.940]  And I want to talk about that in a long segment when we come back and also open the phones up for questions on They Live for Mr. Piper and Mr. Stone, 25th anniversary.
[02:29:38.181 --> 02:29:41.784]  But here's the big question when we come back, Rowdy, why
[02:29:43.183 --> 02:29:45.606]  Why are we somewhat immune?
[02:29:46.106 --> 02:29:48.149]  Why does the propaganda only irritate us?
[02:29:48.669 --> 02:29:51.432]  Why does the signal only make us get angry and more awake?
[02:29:52.233 --> 02:29:55.677]  What is different from us than the general zombified public?
[02:29:55.957 --> 02:29:56.538]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:57.058 --> 02:29:57.959]  We're on the march.

[02:30:10.430 --> 02:30:18.058]  Why do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year, betting their lives that the disaster won't get them?
[02:30:18.479 --> 02:30:23.144]  Hundreds of you helped eFoodsDirect ship 50,000 donated meals to the Oklahoma victims.
[02:30:23.424 --> 02:30:25.306]  The problem is we can't help everybody.
[02:30:25.566 --> 02:30:31.708]  If every one of us who can, will take care of ourselves, we can all pitch in to take care of those who really can't.

[02:33:22.748 --> 02:33:24.048]  They're running the whole show.
[02:33:24.568 --> 02:33:25.329]  They own everything.

[02:33:28.510 --> 02:33:30.311]  What's wrong with having a good for a change?

[02:33:33.333 --> 02:33:34.273]  They're gonna leave us alone.
[02:33:34.633 --> 02:33:35.574]  Let's make some money.

[02:33:41.837 --> 02:33:43.597]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:43.978 --> 02:33:45.418]  Because there is a war on.
[02:33:45.918 --> 02:33:46.839]  For your mind.
[02:33:50.646 --> 02:33:53.587]  Rowdy Roddy Piper on my show.
[02:33:54.248 --> 02:33:55.568]  This is so cool.
[02:33:55.969 --> 02:33:58.890]  And the whole office is pretty excited listening to him on the show.
[02:33:58.930 --> 02:33:59.831]  Everybody loves They Live.
[02:34:00.311 --> 02:34:04.373]  You know, I gotta say, They Live is probably in my top three films.
[02:34:05.513 --> 02:34:07.674]  Anytime I run into it on television, I have to watch it.
[02:34:07.695 --> 02:34:08.455]  My wife's always like,
[02:34:08.755 --> 02:34:10.676]  There you are watching that on DVD again.
[02:34:10.696 --> 02:34:13.218]  I've probably seen it a hundred times.
[02:34:13.438 --> 02:34:15.399]  Because it just breaks down everything.
[02:34:15.779 --> 02:34:18.021]  It's so incredibly evergreen.
[02:34:18.301 --> 02:34:19.882]  And there he is, radio listeners.
[02:34:20.102 --> 02:34:21.963]  You go to Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:34:22.383 --> 02:34:23.424]  See the free video feeds.
[02:34:23.784 --> 02:34:26.726]  There is Mr. Piper right there on our screen.
[02:34:27.166 --> 02:34:29.368]  So sir, you heard the question before the break.
[02:34:30.068 --> 02:34:31.669]  Dealing with the nature of reality.
[02:34:31.769 --> 02:34:37.033]  Dealing with, you know, all the points that are being basically put out there.
[02:34:37.993 --> 02:34:38.814]  By the media.
[02:34:39.475 --> 02:34:45.080]  What do you think, at the bottom of the rabbit hole, what do you think is really going on and dovetailing it with They Live?
[02:34:46.321 --> 02:34:48.323]  Um... Right.
[02:34:48.683 --> 02:34:49.504]  So many variables.
[02:34:52.401 --> 02:35:03.069]  First of all, just before the break you were saying, why does it control some people and why does somebody like myself or maybe Sean, it doesn't control.
[02:35:04.950 --> 02:35:08.513]  And with They Live, the character Nada was based very much on my life.
[02:35:09.493 --> 02:35:10.834]  I don't come from any place.
[02:35:11.315 --> 02:35:14.237]  I was born in a place called Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.
[02:35:14.497 --> 02:35:15.538]  Coldest place on earth.
[02:35:15.938 --> 02:35:20.361]  And I was moved all over the world till I was 13 and I went out by myself.
[02:35:20.781 --> 02:35:24.784]  And then I got into a business with no rules.
[02:35:24.964 --> 02:35:26.965]  Pro Wrestling at 15, no rules at all.
[02:35:27.466 --> 02:35:30.288]  You could do the only thing is you know you had to survive it.
[02:35:31.148 --> 02:35:35.611]  Um, so I wasn't raised under the institution.
[02:35:35.631 --> 02:35:39.913]  I wasn't there to program every day.
[02:35:39.974 --> 02:35:42.255]  They've got, you know, they've got to hit you every day.
[02:35:42.275 --> 02:35:47.878]  I understand on the signs, but in my particular case, my job was to make you angry.
[02:35:48.359 --> 02:35:54.943]  And so I was doing a lot of subliminal things in my interviews and from my own business.
[02:35:55.863 --> 02:35:59.065]  I know what it is to control somebody.
[02:35:59.226 --> 02:36:15.637]  It's like when the, when the radio first came out, and people that would sit by the radio and like, what was it, Seabiscuit, would listen to the Razor, or Joe Louis would smell, uh, Max, uh, smelling, uh, what was the other guy's name?
[02:36:15.737 --> 02:36:16.238]  The Boxer!
[02:36:16.778 --> 02:36:17.478]  Yeah.
[02:36:17.758 --> 02:36:22.799]  They would all tune into the radio because it was like this unbelievable device.
[02:36:23.360 --> 02:36:35.162]  And then when television came on, one of the hottest shows was pro wrestling because it was easily produced and it's an international language.
[02:36:35.722 --> 02:36:38.203]  But within my ranks, there are no rules.
[02:36:38.743 --> 02:36:40.023]  So you can't program me.
[02:36:40.423 --> 02:36:45.985]  And then once you get a little older and I've seen people that are programmed, you learn how they do that.
[02:36:46.225 --> 02:36:52.766]  And it becomes evident that the different things that they do in the government, questions you're not allowed to ask.
[02:36:52.806 --> 02:36:55.087]  Jesse Ventura is a good friend of mine.
[02:36:55.727 --> 02:36:58.868]  Been a tag team partner and Jesse told me
[02:37:04.438 --> 02:37:08.920]  They wanted to know how Jesse got to be governor.
[02:37:10.581 --> 02:37:21.246]  And Jesse himself had told me about a situation he got into where these government officials came and took him underground and started asking him questions.
[02:37:21.667 --> 02:37:23.808]  They just didn't realize Jesse's not afraid.
[02:37:26.369 --> 02:37:28.210]  Jesse Ventura lives in Mexico.
[02:37:28.830 --> 02:37:31.452]  I talk to him as often as I can.
[02:37:32.753 --> 02:37:35.954]  So Jesse's not a programmable guy either.
[02:37:37.215 --> 02:37:37.775]  Absolutely.
[02:37:37.975 --> 02:37:44.759]  Governor Ventura is going to be on the 27th, before he starts his whole media tour in the month of October.
[02:37:44.799 --> 02:37:45.260]  Very excited.
[02:37:45.280 --> 02:37:47.281]  He's got a new book on JFK coming out.
[02:37:48.001 --> 02:37:52.363]  I think you just answered my question there, that I said at the beginning of the break, and I was going to reintroduce.
[02:37:52.843 --> 02:37:57.684]  What makes those of us that are immune or resistant to the programming?
[02:37:58.004 --> 02:38:03.226]  And I think it's that we grew up as individuals, and we grew up and had a brush with the streets.
[02:38:03.626 --> 02:38:12.409]  I grew up in a middle class area, but for whatever reason, there was a lot of fights, a lot of corrupt police, government drug dealing, a lot of police running hookers, you name it.
[02:38:12.710 --> 02:38:13.470]  And I grew up
[02:38:14.150 --> 02:38:22.493]  You know, watching this going on in my neighborhood, and then watching the same cops give speeches against drug use at school, and I called them out, and they threatened to kill me and stuff.
[02:38:22.793 --> 02:38:31.616]  But I think that was kind of my wake-up was, I put the sunglasses on because I saw the other side, and saw how naive everybody is, and I think you said it best.
[02:38:32.016 --> 02:38:34.257]  They want to get the youth, dumb them down,
[02:38:35.077 --> 02:38:39.720]  Make it all a bunch of political correctness to where the kids don't even know how to make a sandwich.
[02:38:40.100 --> 02:38:43.362]  They're not allowed to get in a fist fight to learn how to defend themselves.
[02:38:43.502 --> 02:38:45.083]  They're not allowed to play dodgeball.
[02:38:45.544 --> 02:38:49.406]  They're at school till 8 o'clock now because parents got to work two jobs.
[02:38:49.706 --> 02:38:55.730]  They are attacking our basic humanity because a basic human is not going to be a slave.
[02:38:57.151 --> 02:39:01.553]  You know Alex, what's interesting, I'm listening to how the discourse is always they, right?
[02:39:01.673 --> 02:39:03.555]  And the funny thing is, they live.
[02:39:04.366 --> 02:39:04.886]  Who is they?
[02:39:04.946 --> 02:39:06.027]  People always say, who is they?
[02:39:06.047 --> 02:39:07.768]  You know, the conspiracy theorists, we're always saying they.
[02:39:08.188 --> 02:39:16.333]  And what's interesting about what you're saying and what Rod was saying, all of us, I think, come across this corruption at some point in our lives, right?
[02:39:16.393 --> 02:39:21.196]  And it's not just... The fact of traveling is amazing, obviously, when you get brushed with the streets, it's amazing.
[02:39:21.236 --> 02:39:27.440]  But at the end of the day, we all come across corruption, we all see the corruption in the police force, we all see corruption in schools, in our own family, right?
[02:39:28.376 --> 02:39:30.118]  The question is, do we go along to get along?
[02:39:30.138 --> 02:39:31.659]  Or do we start to point it out?
[02:39:31.679 --> 02:39:36.664]  Now, those of us who are more inclined toward justice and whatnot, we want to see the good thing happen.
[02:39:36.944 --> 02:39:41.188]  But there's still this factor in the film that we haven't talked about yet, and that is...
[02:39:42.267 --> 02:39:43.428]  There are sociopaths.
[02:39:43.768 --> 02:39:47.811]  There are people that are part of the population that have no emotion.
[02:39:47.831 --> 02:39:48.571]  They are not human.
[02:39:48.711 --> 02:39:58.838]  And I think the human race has not yet come to terms with the fact that there are 10% of the population that are sociopathic, that do not have human emotion or boundaries, and they are not human.
[02:39:59.098 --> 02:40:11.646]  So when we say, hey, we'll give him a pass, he's human, hey, he made a mistake, we're not understanding that the fundamental thing that they were talking about is a small percentage of the population that does not care about humanity.
[02:40:11.846 --> 02:40:13.207]  They live, we sleep.
[02:40:14.708 --> 02:40:33.422]  Rowdy, what's your take on why you've been immune to their programming and why some people are born with the glasses on or have them on pretty early and other people, it seems, are just born to be slaves to the sociopaths and the psychopaths that are 1% of the population that run them?
[02:40:34.283 --> 02:40:37.506]  It's a good question.
[02:40:39.367 --> 02:40:40.027]  You have to be
[02:40:41.852 --> 02:40:45.174]  You have to live within the system to be programmed.
[02:40:47.335 --> 02:40:52.117]  They have to at least get to you, your senses, in some way.
[02:40:52.957 --> 02:40:54.978]  And if they don't know where you are,
[02:40:55.842 --> 02:40:59.946]  And they don't know how, like I didn't have until I was 19 years old.
[02:41:00.026 --> 02:41:01.228]  Nobody knew I was alive.
[02:41:01.828 --> 02:41:03.570]  I didn't have a social security number.
[02:41:03.950 --> 02:41:05.232]  I didn't have any passport.
[02:41:05.472 --> 02:41:06.293]  I didn't have anything.
[02:41:07.754 --> 02:41:15.542]  And so I was this kid that would do whatever I needed to do that the guys, the older pro wrestlers would tell me to do.
[02:41:16.563 --> 02:41:21.525]  How did you fall into wrestling at a record young age of 14?
[02:41:21.965 --> 02:41:21.525]  15.
[02:41:22.646 --> 02:41:28.488]  I lived on the street for two years and I was staying at a youth hostel.
[02:41:29.389 --> 02:41:38.392]  The youth hostel was a YMCA and I was a 167 amateur wrestling champion and I boxed and somebody just didn't show up in Winnipeg.
[02:41:40.277 --> 02:41:44.260]  At the matches, and my amateur wrestling coach was a referee.
[02:41:44.720 --> 02:41:48.842]  He says, I can get you 25 bucks if you want to fight this guy, but you'll lose your amateur status.
[02:41:49.403 --> 02:41:51.504]  I'd never seen a pro wrestling match in my life.
[02:41:51.964 --> 02:41:53.965]  But I came fifth in the world playing the bagpipes.
[02:41:54.546 --> 02:41:56.827]  And I went to my band, and I said, what's going on?
[02:41:56.847 --> 02:41:58.248]  They said, we'll play you in.
[02:42:00.329 --> 02:42:05.952]  Four bagpipers, a bass drummer with a big, furly hat, two snares, and me come walking in.
[02:42:05.972 --> 02:42:08.374]  And I don't know if you remember Mr. Perfect.
[02:42:09.162 --> 02:42:09.423]  I am.
[02:42:09.803 --> 02:42:15.471]  Yeah, well, it was his dad, Larry the Axe Henning, and you know, it was still sawdust on the floor.
[02:42:16.132 --> 02:42:18.376]  And he didn't much like my entrance.
[02:42:18.396 --> 02:42:21.200]  It was the shortest match in the history of the Winnipeg Arena.
[02:42:21.240 --> 02:42:22.441]  He beat me in 10 seconds.
[02:42:24.866 --> 02:42:27.948]  So back then it was like real wrestling, it wasn't just like ballet?
[02:42:28.528 --> 02:42:29.588]  Oh no, no.
[02:42:29.668 --> 02:42:36.311]  There's this kid coming with all these bagpipers and he was a top guy and he just took me and beat me.
[02:42:37.472 --> 02:42:41.753]  He broke my nose, split my eye open and they came and said, kid you did great!
[02:42:42.294 --> 02:42:43.954]  How'd you like to go to San Francisco?
[02:42:44.234 --> 02:42:52.518]  They put me in a van and snuck me over the border and I rolled every day until I was 19 in the Olympic Auditorium in Los Angeles.
[02:42:53.159 --> 02:42:54.663]  And they finally got me a green card.
[02:42:55.204 --> 02:42:57.050]  You know, they ought to make a movie about you.
[02:42:57.110 --> 02:42:58.554]  What'd you think of the movie, The Wrestler?
[02:42:59.416 --> 02:43:01.101]  Ah, what did I think of the movie, The Wrestler?
[02:43:04.414 --> 02:43:04.914]  Proof.
[02:43:04.994 --> 02:43:13.597]  It's one of those things that, like, with They Live, with the conspiracies, you know, and tying that all in, you know, you gotta go, you gotta go deep.
[02:43:13.617 --> 02:43:17.439]  You have to have the courage to dive in, and the faith.
[02:43:18.019 --> 02:43:25.402]  And with The Wrestler, I give Mickey Rourke a, you know, thumbs up for portraying the character, but you just skim the surface.
[02:43:26.102 --> 02:43:33.525]  You don't understand real programming, nor how ugly, how ugly that gets, um, day after day after day.
[02:43:34.506 --> 02:43:43.694]  So wrestling, I mean wrestling in the early days was also, I mean was people a lot of times actually fighting and then I guess it segued because of all the injuries into something that was more stylized?
[02:43:45.589 --> 02:43:46.490]  Yeah, kind of.
[02:43:46.990 --> 02:43:49.872]  Let me just give you, I don't know if this applies, but let me try.
[02:43:49.892 --> 02:43:53.635]  When I was like 17 years old, there was this promoter.
[02:43:54.436 --> 02:44:02.022]  And when you got in to get paid, the old timers would tell me, you held out your hands and the first thing he put in was $10 a quarter.
[02:44:02.963 --> 02:44:04.364]  And he would look at you.
[02:44:04.965 --> 02:44:07.547]  And then he'd put a $5 bill and he'd look at you.
[02:44:07.987 --> 02:44:09.689]  And if you smiled, he'd stop.
[02:44:10.729 --> 02:44:12.191]  So they would tell me, don't smile.
[02:44:13.285 --> 02:44:14.506]  Because he would program you.
[02:44:15.967 --> 02:44:21.631]  If you ever had a clicker to go into the arena because you used to get paid by the house, you'd be fired.
[02:44:23.933 --> 02:44:28.396]  If you asked questions about how much money was being drawn, you'd be fired and blackballed.
[02:44:28.996 --> 02:44:30.097]  It's total control.
[02:44:30.357 --> 02:44:32.318]  Well, I've been blackballed five times.
[02:44:32.579 --> 02:44:33.940]  It doesn't bother me anymore.
[02:44:36.378 --> 02:44:44.224]  Um, there's a lot of guys in my sport that don't have the opportunity to be on a wonderful show like this that you can speak your mind.
[02:44:44.244 --> 02:44:51.790]  Um, and I think that there's a lot of people just around the world that are very confused because you can't just, uh,
[02:44:52.932 --> 02:44:54.694]  They can't just pinpoint what it is.
[02:44:55.135 --> 02:45:00.361]  And that's where I come to people like yourself, Alex and Sean, a little bit of renegade.
[02:45:00.761 --> 02:45:06.849]  I'm not the kind of people, you know, I don't like to be told what to do, but at the same time, I like to try to do the right thing.
[02:45:07.189 --> 02:45:07.790]  Absolutely.
[02:45:07.810 --> 02:45:07.890]  Wow.
[02:45:08.931 --> 02:45:14.053]  Well, Rowdy Roddy Piper is our guest with Sean Stone, and we've only got like 15 minutes until the show is over.
[02:45:14.073 --> 02:45:16.053]  We'll take you guys right to the end if you can do it.
[02:45:16.073 --> 02:45:17.754]  I want to take some phone calls.
[02:45:18.454 --> 02:45:19.614]  Rowdy, you ready to take some calls?
[02:45:19.934 --> 02:45:20.414]  You betcha!
[02:45:20.754 --> 02:45:23.035]  Alright, let's go to Will in Georgia.
[02:45:23.675 --> 02:45:27.376]  You're on the air with the legendary star of They Live.
[02:45:27.436 --> 02:45:27.837]  Go ahead.
[02:45:28.697 --> 02:45:29.117]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:45:29.137 --> 02:45:30.317]  That's a great movie, Rowdy.
[02:45:30.337 --> 02:45:31.137]  You did a good job.
[02:45:31.378 --> 02:45:32.838]  It's a true ministry.
[02:45:33.627 --> 02:45:41.374]  On the They Live, I actually married into the They part of They Live that controlled the New York, L.A., Sodom and Gomorrah axis, Hollywood, Babylon.
[02:45:42.074 --> 02:45:47.439]  And they taught my kids every morning on Saturday during worship services that everybody wasn't part of their tribe.
[02:45:47.459 --> 02:45:51.182]  It was subhuman animals, cattle, just like I said in the movie.
[02:45:51.482 --> 02:45:55.426]  And they actually put that, I mean, the preacher, the rabbi would tell them
[02:45:56.129 --> 02:46:03.343]  That your job growing up and from birth, they call them this, is to cheat, lie to, rob, enslave, and kill all the Gentiles.
[02:46:03.404 --> 02:46:06.229]  Alright, well listen, do you have a specific question, sir?
[02:46:07.372 --> 02:46:09.673]  Well, no, I mean, it's just, we're Whigs.
[02:46:09.773 --> 02:46:14.555]  America is, our focus has to be on the Creator, who's named the sovereign of the United States, the creative universe.
[02:46:14.715 --> 02:46:16.255]  Alright, well listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:46:16.555 --> 02:46:18.836]  We've got questions or comments for our guests.
[02:46:19.176 --> 02:46:29.600]  We don't screen calls, so sometimes it becomes a soapbox, but there are always subgroups within any culture that teach that we're the best, everybody else, I mean, look what we say about the Arabs when we go invade and attack them, and then
[02:46:30.040 --> 02:46:31.701]  You know, or what happened to the American Indians?
[02:46:31.741 --> 02:46:34.343]  I mean, this is something that goes through cultures everywhere.
[02:46:34.723 --> 02:46:47.731]  But, I mean, I guess the movie They Live does speak to class stratas, but I think it's about, more about individuals being psychopaths and sociopaths, about how they can be black, they can be white, they can be German, they can be Jewish, they can be Chinese.
[02:46:48.152 --> 02:46:52.555]  There are people genetically, I think, who really aren't human.
[02:46:52.595 --> 02:46:56.017]  Well, Alex, I was going to ask, actually I wanted to ask Rowdy that because, um,
[02:46:56.517 --> 02:47:10.643]  You know, I'm really curious to know where that story came from, because Carpenter wrote it, and I mean, he must, you know, in your interaction with him, I'm sure you came across some interesting discussions as to what he thought, you know, who they really are, and does he really believe that they are aliens?
[02:47:10.663 --> 02:47:11.683]  Yeah, who is they?
[02:47:11.783 --> 02:47:12.223]  Exactly.
[02:47:15.225 --> 02:47:17.606]  At that time in 88, I think it came out in 88,
[02:47:20.129 --> 02:47:25.194]  They was the propaganda the world was shoving down our throats.
[02:47:25.795 --> 02:47:30.239]  But John and I, we talked a lot before we made this movie.
[02:47:30.399 --> 02:47:31.520]  I took it real serious.
[02:47:32.361 --> 02:47:43.192]  And, you know, I don't want to speak for John, but just the way I remember it is, again, I don't think that we're the only
[02:47:45.126 --> 02:47:52.692]  I don't think we're the only living source of energy in the universe, by any means at all.
[02:47:54.414 --> 02:48:09.226]  And there's big committees right now getting together and saying, talking about people, or excuse me, things from other planets, aliens, whatever you want to call them, tall whites, greys, reptiles, and we weren't
[02:48:09.586 --> 02:48:25.796]  That detailed with it but John and I both agreed that we don't think that we're alone in the universe and I think that I ran across a doctor friend of mine who didn't agree with me at all and I found that amazing that an educated man like that would not
[02:48:27.577 --> 02:48:28.597]  Would not see that far.
[02:48:28.657 --> 02:48:29.478]  But you know what?
[02:48:29.538 --> 02:48:30.638]  Maybe I'm the crazy one.
[02:48:30.678 --> 02:48:31.278]  I don't know there.
[02:48:31.518 --> 02:48:37.320]  Well, also, speaking of Mr. Carpenter, who I would love to get on, I'm a fan of his work as well, obviously.
[02:48:38.381 --> 02:48:43.922]  His 1980, whatever year it was, The Thing with Kurt Russell is so good.
[02:48:43.942 --> 02:48:46.223]  I mean, that is another amazing film.
[02:48:47.284 --> 02:48:47.724]  Big time.
[02:48:49.907 --> 02:48:53.170]  John made a lot of, uh, a lot of films together.
[02:48:53.590 --> 02:48:56.733]  Um, here's, uh, just a little layman note.
[02:48:57.073 --> 02:49:01.376]  The last, uh, Kurt Russell film, I think, with John was Big Trouble Little China.
[02:49:01.757 --> 02:49:02.077]  Oh, yeah.
[02:49:02.357 --> 02:49:04.919]  Kurt was driving the semi with sunglasses on.
[02:49:05.299 --> 02:49:08.542]  Well, after that movie was finished, they had all those sunglasses left.
[02:49:08.562 --> 02:49:10.664]  That's the sunglasses you see in They Live.
[02:49:12.469 --> 02:49:15.831]  You know, there's a little levity as we're going along here at World in the World.
[02:49:16.732 --> 02:49:18.693]  Um, you know, it's all about budget.
[02:49:19.554 --> 02:49:24.557]  Uh... But the story for They Live came from a short story, or did he come up with the story himself?
[02:49:25.058 --> 02:49:28.260]  No, it came from a short story called 8 O'Clock High.
[02:49:29.261 --> 02:49:30.722]  And, uh... That's right, the guy's still alive.
[02:49:30.742 --> 02:49:32.143]  We tried to get in contact with him.
[02:49:33.348 --> 02:49:34.569]  I would have loved to speak with him.
[02:49:34.909 --> 02:49:39.870]  Yeah, Mr. Rowdy Roddy Piper, you have been such a huge influence on me and I've been a professional wrestler for over 10 years.
[02:49:58.255 --> 02:50:03.917]  And I idolized you, I looked up to you, and it's an honor and a privilege to speak with you on the air.
[02:50:04.057 --> 02:50:12.160]  And I also host a podcast as well on the topics that you and Alex have been discussing through your time here, and I appreciate you for that as well.
[02:50:12.920 --> 02:50:20.182]  My two questions for you are, sir, is one, did you expect the movie They Live to be such a huge cult classic as it's turned into be?
[02:50:20.702 --> 02:50:25.884]  And two, how many boys in the wrestling business do you think are aware of the New World Order?
[02:50:27.472 --> 02:50:28.593]  Great questions.
[02:50:29.174 --> 02:50:29.975]  Good job.
[02:50:32.458 --> 02:50:33.460]  What was the first one again?
[02:50:33.880 --> 02:50:35.522]  We're going to go to break, but answer the first one.
[02:50:35.702 --> 02:50:38.065]  Did you think that they live was going to be so huge?
[02:50:39.347 --> 02:50:40.929]  No, no, I didn't.
[02:50:41.129 --> 02:50:44.333]  At the time, I didn't think it would stand this test of time.
[02:50:45.520 --> 02:50:50.261]  We're going to come back and only got like six minutes left on the other side, then we'll let them go because the show's going to be over here.
[02:50:50.281 --> 02:50:55.063]  You could have World War III with Syria, but we're talking about They Live, but that's kind of fitting because it gets us thinking.
[02:50:55.423 --> 02:51:05.926]  25th anniversary, you can go to rowdyroddypiper.com and you can see all the great info that he's got right there on the site.

[02:54:40.523 --> 02:54:45.447]  By the way, Julie Wilson, one of our writers, just ran in here and she saw the clip.
[02:54:45.507 --> 02:54:50.731]  Rush Limbaugh came out today and said he thinks it's a false flag attack in Syria staged by Obama.

[02:54:52.893 --> 02:54:53.693]  We have the video clip.

[02:55:11.045 --> 02:55:22.269]  But wow, what do you make Mr. Piper about having like all these mainstream people now say they think the whole thing in Syria staged by the rebels.
[02:55:22.289 --> 02:55:23.110]  There's video of it.
[02:55:23.430 --> 02:55:26.211]  I mean, it's just it's amazing to see everything we've talked about.
[02:55:26.551 --> 02:55:29.572]  Sean Stone and I and others is now just mainstream.
[02:55:30.452 --> 02:55:34.254]  Do you think the world is putting on the black sunglasses more and more?
[02:55:38.353 --> 02:55:42.618]  That uh... I think the world, you know what I think?
[02:55:42.758 --> 02:55:52.269]  I think that... I think the world, the real men of the world have to stand up and say, I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass!
[02:55:56.747 --> 02:55:58.809]  Time to take a stand, boys.
[02:55:59.329 --> 02:55:59.950]  You know what?
[02:56:00.030 --> 02:56:01.251]  You got a little courage.
[02:56:01.692 --> 02:56:03.013]  Stand up for yourself.
[02:56:03.193 --> 02:56:03.954]  Baby Jesus.
[02:56:04.595 --> 02:56:07.378]  Oh, a bunch of sniveling whiners over in Syria?
[02:56:07.758 --> 02:56:09.100]  Like, I'm not qualified.
[02:56:09.500 --> 02:56:11.903]  I just know, like, who you gonna send over there?
[02:56:12.543 --> 02:56:13.985]  Why don't the Chinese help?
[02:56:14.205 --> 02:56:15.466]  What is the UN doing?
[02:56:16.227 --> 02:56:17.568]  And I saw those pictures.
[02:56:18.769 --> 02:56:20.930]  I'm not qualified, but I got four kids.
[02:56:21.310 --> 02:56:22.611]  And I got real angry.
[02:56:23.071 --> 02:56:27.234]  Yeah, they're trying to punch our buttons, but man, Rush Limbaugh coming out saying it's a false flag.
[02:56:27.414 --> 02:56:27.814]  Wow!
[02:56:28.734 --> 02:56:29.995]  It's a ratings ploy.
[02:56:30.175 --> 02:56:31.316]  Yeah, who knows?
[02:56:31.376 --> 02:56:32.777]  Sean, that's a pretty big deal, isn't it?
[02:56:33.752 --> 02:56:44.215]  That's a huge deal of limbaugh saying it, which probably gives credence to the fact that, you know, how can you sell the idea of the Assad government using chemical weapons when it's been leaked for months that the U.S.
[02:56:44.235 --> 02:56:48.576]  has been trying to sell chemical weapons and send them there for a false flag purpose?
[02:56:48.596 --> 02:56:52.637]  I mean, it's almost like the conspiracy is becoming more and more flagrant in advance, right?
[02:56:52.657 --> 02:56:58.139]  People can see it coming, the story's being reported, so you can't, you know, keep it contained.
[02:56:58.659 --> 02:56:59.259]  What are you going to do?
[02:56:59.719 --> 02:57:00.999]  Listen, I don't want to hog the show.
[02:57:01.019 --> 02:57:02.160]  We got like three minutes left.
[02:57:02.500 --> 02:57:04.480]  Rowdyroddypiper.com.
[02:57:04.800 --> 02:57:06.260]  He's got links to his Twitter up there.
[02:57:06.560 --> 02:57:07.241]  Just amazing.
[02:57:07.521 --> 02:57:08.841]  And I was talking to Rowdy earlier.
[02:57:08.861 --> 02:57:10.701]  He said he'll come on every once in a while with us.
[02:57:10.721 --> 02:57:15.382]  We're very honored to have him here on the show and honored to know that he's a fan of our work.
[02:57:15.422 --> 02:57:16.722]  We're just incredible fans of his.
[02:57:17.003 --> 02:57:17.963]  Real fast callers.
[02:57:18.003 --> 02:57:19.003]  You got quick questions.
[02:57:19.403 --> 02:57:20.823]  Ryan in Missouri, you're on the air.
[02:57:20.843 --> 02:57:21.203]  Go ahead.
[02:57:21.223 --> 02:57:23.224]  Hey, gentlemen.
[02:57:23.724 --> 02:57:27.225]  They live, they have the underground tunnel system, underground base system.
[02:57:27.625 --> 02:57:28.385]  My question is,
[02:57:29.341 --> 02:57:35.226]  Some people think that Denver International is like some super secret base, spaceport, whatever you guys want to call it.
[02:57:35.246 --> 02:57:36.807]  Well, there's giant underground bases everywhere, yeah.
[02:57:37.408 --> 02:57:42.512]  Yeah, so I mean, I guess my question is, do you think it's, you know, like the movie, they say it's almost like Aliens.
[02:57:43.092 --> 02:57:47.476]  Does, I mean, I guess Roddy already answered that, but does he think that, you know, does he put two and two together like that?
[02:57:48.140 --> 02:57:59.405]  I know exactly what you're talking about in Denver, and that they had a huge portrait from like the Holocaust to chemical weapons, and then they took the picture down.
[02:57:59.685 --> 02:58:00.845]  So I understand what you're saying.
[02:58:01.166 --> 02:58:04.967]  Again, they, they, you need to stand up against they.
[02:58:05.087 --> 02:58:07.748]  And I, yes, yes, the answer.
[02:58:07.788 --> 02:58:11.210]  Coming into that tunnel, it's like where the Illuminati have their meetings.
[02:58:12.546 --> 02:58:14.328]  Anything that you don't think about those meetings?
[02:58:14.348 --> 02:58:15.609]  I don't know anything about them.
[02:58:16.149 --> 02:58:18.251]  I like to go in there and say hi to those guys.
[02:58:19.772 --> 02:58:22.134]  Well, Sean, I bet you know about those meetings.
[02:58:22.915 --> 02:58:25.177]  I haven't been invited yet, but I think it's time he and I do a movie.
[02:58:25.197 --> 02:58:28.219]  And we'll go chew gum together and have some fun.
[02:58:28.499 --> 02:58:30.901]  Well, folks, Rowdy, Sean, stay there.
[02:58:30.921 --> 02:58:32.182]  I'm going to say bye to you at the end of the show.
[02:58:32.483 --> 02:58:33.503]  This has been an amazing interview.
[02:58:33.804 --> 02:58:35.165]  Thank you both for your time.
[02:58:35.185 --> 02:58:37.347]  And Mr. Piper, it's good to know you.
[02:58:38.024 --> 02:58:38.484]  God bless you.
[02:58:38.805 --> 02:58:38.985]  Thank you.
[02:58:39.045 --> 02:58:39.605]  Wow, wow.
[02:58:39.625 --> 02:58:40.847]  Okay, sorry to the other callers.
[02:58:40.867 --> 02:58:41.407]  We're out of time.
[02:58:41.447 --> 02:58:43.469]  Nightly News Tonight, 7 o'clock Central.
[02:58:43.509 --> 02:58:45.691]  Lord willing, we'll be back tomorrow live, 11 a.m.
[02:58:45.711 --> 02:58:46.491]  Central on the radio.
[02:58:49.614 --> 02:58:50.695]  How about we start living?
[02:58:50.775 --> 02:58:51.716]  How about we wake up?
[02:58:52.597 --> 02:58:56.700]  How about the New World Order start getting off our planet?
[02:58:57.583 --> 02:59:02.168]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on health care?
[02:59:02.308 --> 02:59:10.677]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet, the highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease?
[02:59:10.997 --> 02:59:12.659]  It all comes down to one thing.
[02:59:12.939 --> 02:59:14.241]  We are what we eat.
[02:59:14.561 --> 02:59:18.906]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[02:59:19.246 --> 02:59:23.210]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[02:59:23.471 --> 02:59:24.872]  All of this has been engineered
