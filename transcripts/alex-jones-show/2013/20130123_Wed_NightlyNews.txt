[00:00:22.273 --> 00:00:23.918]  Welcome to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:24.059 --> 00:00:25.302]  I'm your host, Jakari Jackson.
[00:00:25.623 --> 00:00:27.890]  This is what we have in store for you on this January 23rd, 2013 edition.
[00:00:32.844 --> 00:00:44.994]  Tonight, the new assault weapons ban brought to you by Dianne Feinstein will ban 120 specific guns and magazines holding more than 10 rounds of ammo.
[00:00:45.315 --> 00:00:51.480]  Gun owners will also be expected to register their firearms with the federal government.
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:01:00.648]  Meanwhile, a Pennsylvania elementary school refuses to back down over a five-year-old girl's bubble gun terroristic threat.
[00:01:00.888 --> 00:01:07.590]  The school took this so seriously that administrators even ordered that the five-year-old receive a psychological evaluation.
[00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:22.715]  Then, contrary to reports that the TSA is eliminating naked x-ray body scanners, we now learn that the federal agency signed a contract months ago with a separate company to provide the very same machines.
[00:01:23.175 --> 00:01:24.375]  Never saw that one coming.
[00:01:24.795 --> 00:01:29.617]  Those stories plus much more up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:34.465 --> 00:01:34.966]  Welcome back.
[00:01:35.346 --> 00:01:36.488]  Top story headline.
[00:01:36.989 --> 00:01:40.915]  Sinister Dianne Feinstein to introduce assault weapons ban Thursday.
[00:01:41.335 --> 00:01:42.076]  No surprise here.
[00:01:42.116 --> 00:01:43.058]  Let's take a look at the article.
[00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:50.189]  The bill is expected to ban 120 specific guns and ammunition magazines holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition.
[00:01:50.689 --> 00:02:05.194]  The legislation is also expected to require gun owners to register semi-automatic rifles categorized as assault weapons with the federal government under the National Firearms Act, which may require assault rifle owners to pay a $200 registering fee.
[00:02:05.214 --> 00:02:06.034]  That's enough right there, $200.
[00:02:06.195 --> 00:02:10.136]  And submit photographs and fingerprints to the ATF.
[00:02:10.496 --> 00:02:11.136]  We're good to go.
[00:02:28.767 --> 00:02:31.769]  Call your congressman, call whoever you can, just say we want this thrown off.
[00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.834]  Remember in Illinois, they try twice in a week, I believe once on a Sunday, to ban things such as pump-action shotguns.
[00:02:38.174 --> 00:02:43.518]  And things like this are going to continue until they get rid of all the guns, as evidenced by our next story.
[00:02:43.999 --> 00:02:46.921]  Australian gun grabbers target bolt-action rifles.
[00:02:46.981 --> 00:02:50.764]  That's right, you always hear about Australia and the UK and how they got rid of
[00:02:51.164 --> 00:03:09.301]  They got rid of most of their guns and how their gun violence went significantly down, which is true, but a thing they always leave out, especially in the UK, they got rid of the guns, but they still have the knives, the bats, and yes, they have less gun-related incidents, but they have more stabbings, beatings with clubs and bats and whatever else.
[00:03:09.561 --> 00:03:10.562]  Let's take a look at this article.
[00:03:10.922 --> 00:03:25.433]  Following the Port Arthur Massacre in Australia in 1996, the government banned all semi-automatic guns and launched a buyback program that cost taxpayers $500 million and resulted in the destruction of over 600,000 personal firearms.
[00:03:25.854 --> 00:03:32.479]  Following the ban, Australians began arming themselves with single-action and bolt-action rifles not outlawed by the government.
[00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:39.773]  Australian gun grabbers are now targeting one shot in bolt-action rifles, stating that it only takes one bullet to kill somebody.
[00:03:40.273 --> 00:03:41.254]  Which is true.
[00:03:41.434 --> 00:03:45.315]  I'm not arguing with that point, that it only takes one bullet to kill somebody.
[00:03:45.695 --> 00:03:47.956]  But the point in this is, is they're never satisfied.
[00:03:47.976 --> 00:03:50.618]  They're not going to be satisfied with your high-capacity magazines.
[00:03:50.638 --> 00:03:53.119]  They're not going to be satisfied with quote, assault rifles.
[00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:56.140]  Most of these politicians don't even know what assault rifle actually is.
[00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:57.621]  They're just trying to ban your gun.
[00:03:57.641 --> 00:03:58.321]  So stand up,
[00:03:58.961 --> 00:04:07.105]  You may not have a gun or you may not see a use for such things such as the AR-15 or AK-47, but just keep in mind it was incremental.
[00:04:07.285 --> 00:04:14.028]  It went from 1996 and now 2013 and Australia is pretty much disarmed, or at least that's what they're trying to do.
[00:04:14.388 --> 00:04:15.849]  So how long is it going to take here in the U.S.?
[00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:17.069]  Stand up for your rights.
[00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:18.910]  Do not let them take them away.
[00:04:19.597 --> 00:04:26.763]  Now, in other not-even-gun-related news, school will not back down over five-year-old girl's bubble gun terroristic threat.
[00:04:27.164 --> 00:04:29.826]  Yes, they are now calling five-year-olds terrorists.
[00:04:29.846 --> 00:04:33.769]  Well, the TSA already does that, but let's take a look at this article and see what it has to say.
[00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:41.015]  School officials reportedly categorized the incident as a terroristic threat and labeled the girl's action as a threat to harm others.
[00:04:41.476 --> 00:04:44.619]  Superintendent Bernard Steller of Mount Carmel School
[00:04:45.459 --> 00:04:49.663]  So we have a clip of the so-called terroristic threat from the local news and let's take a look at that.
[00:05:10.282 --> 00:05:13.764]  Is this the weapon of choice for a new kind of terrorist?
[00:05:14.204 --> 00:05:15.605]  Terror by bubbles.
[00:05:15.745 --> 00:05:20.328]  The small pink Hello Kitty toy gun is an automatic bubble blower.
[00:05:20.568 --> 00:05:29.274]  But just days ago, when a 5-year-old girl said she and a classmate should shoot each other with bubbles, the school called it a terrorist threat.
[00:05:29.354 --> 00:05:35.998]  The school took this so seriously that administrators even ordered that the 5-year-old receive a psychological evaluation.
[00:05:36.158 --> 00:05:41.665]  Keep in mind, they're trying to put this on the girl's permanent record, so I'm not exactly sure what can be used with this.
[00:05:41.785 --> 00:05:44.849]  They say, well, this girl's been a terrorist since she was five years old.
[00:05:45.149 --> 00:05:47.412]  She can't join the military if that's what she chooses to do.
[00:05:47.793 --> 00:05:51.057]  They may say she can't own a real firearm someday.
[00:05:51.457 --> 00:05:54.942]  But to be fair to the superintendent and the other people at Mount Carmel,
[00:05:56.092 --> 00:06:01.037]  Bubbles are a dangerous substance and there have been cases where people have actually been threatened with them.
[00:06:01.417 --> 00:06:07.242]  So let's take a look at this clip of an officer who is trying to defend himself and his fellow officers from bubbles.
[00:06:07.262 --> 00:06:07.803]  Let's take a look.
[00:06:13.608 --> 00:06:14.769]  Yes, that's right.
[00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:17.571]  It's a deliberate act on your behalf.
[00:06:17.631 --> 00:06:18.932]  We're going to arrest you.
[00:06:19.152 --> 00:06:20.213]  Do you understand me?
[00:06:20.273 --> 00:06:22.855]  Right, you're going to be in handcuffs.
[00:06:23.235 --> 00:06:23.775]  Alright?
[00:06:24.096 --> 00:06:28.158]  You either knock it off with the bubble, or you touch me with that bubble and we're going into custody.
[00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:28.819]  Right?
[00:06:29.099 --> 00:06:30.580]  I'm putting it away.
[00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:31.361]  Right, thank you.
[00:06:31.601 --> 00:06:32.902]  But I would also like to know...
[00:06:33.482 --> 00:06:40.143]  You want to bait the police, throw that on, you're that other officer, and it gets in her eyes, it's a detergent, it'll be going into custody.
[00:06:40.224 --> 00:06:40.884]  I understand that.
[00:06:40.904 --> 00:06:42.644]  Do we understand each other?
[00:06:42.704 --> 00:06:43.504]  I do, I appreciate it.
[00:06:43.544 --> 00:06:44.424]  And put it away.
[00:06:44.664 --> 00:06:46.325]  I am doing that at this moment.
[00:06:46.365 --> 00:06:46.545]  Right.
[00:06:46.585 --> 00:06:47.725]  I really appreciate it.
[00:06:47.745 --> 00:06:48.545]  Discussion's over.
[00:06:48.565 --> 00:06:50.646]  If we could treat it with a bit of respect.
[00:06:50.786 --> 00:06:51.426]  I just did.
[00:06:51.686 --> 00:06:52.706]  I just did.
[00:06:56.707 --> 00:06:58.388]  You got what you deserve.
[00:06:58.448 --> 00:06:59.629]  You got my respect.
[00:06:59.969 --> 00:07:02.750]  I don't feel very interested.
[00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:04.391]  I'm just trying to keep you happy.
[00:07:04.451 --> 00:07:05.311]  That's terrible.
[00:07:05.371 --> 00:07:06.692]  My heart bleeds.
[00:07:06.732 --> 00:07:07.012]  Mine too.
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.641]  So you see the guy right there, you got what you deserved.
[00:07:14.142 --> 00:07:16.863]  I mean, the guy looks like a big, intimidating, tough guy.
[00:07:16.903 --> 00:07:32.410]  I mean, I guess there were no bank robberies or drug deals or kidnappings or rapes or beatings or anything else that could have been done that day that, you know, maybe had precedence over a bubble protest, you know, this dangerous bubble weapon.
[00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:34.911]  I'm just curious, does anybody know what happened to that girl?
[00:07:34.951 --> 00:07:35.671]  Do we have a clip of that?
[00:07:39.839 --> 00:07:42.182]  Oh, okay, she got arrested.
[00:07:42.262 --> 00:07:49.390]  So while Bubble Girl is getting arrested, the drug dealers and the pimps and the human traffickers are all running around.
[00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:52.233]  But I guess that's no deal and that happened in 2010.
[00:07:54.781 --> 00:07:55.381]  Not a big deal.
[00:07:55.401 --> 00:07:59.984]  You got bubbles, that's a terroristic threat, but hey, everybody else can run wild.
[00:08:00.544 --> 00:08:10.670]  So in a similar story, not so much bubbles, but with schools and other shenanigans, elementary school girl threatened with arrest over paper gun.
[00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:20.395]  A South Philadelphia elementary school student was searched in front of classmates and threatened with arrest after she mistakenly brought a paper gun to school.
[00:08:21.144 --> 00:08:32.002]  When a school administrator found a piece of paper, I'm glad they admit it's a piece of paper, Valentine was verbally chastised in front of the whole class, and according to her mother, even threatened with arrest.
[00:08:32.979 --> 00:08:38.181]  And an article goes on to mention some other instances of complete overreaction.
[00:08:38.221 --> 00:08:48.505]  You guys have heard the stories of people bringing a Nerf gun to school and they lock down the school over a green-orange gun and people call the cops on kids playing in their front yard pointing fingers at each other.
[00:08:48.865 --> 00:08:50.226]  Complete ridiculousness.
[00:08:51.126 --> 00:08:53.967]  These kids don't even have real guns and people are freaking out.
[00:08:54.327 --> 00:09:00.670]  Just the mere notion, the thought of some type of potential firearm and people just freak out.
[00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:03.651]  It's completely ridiculous and over the top.
[00:09:03.971 --> 00:09:08.053]  They try to say we're fear mongers, threatening of some type of tyrannical government.
[00:09:08.373 --> 00:09:15.235]  I think that a government has something like the Patriot Act, the NSA, the National Defense Authorization Act, drones.
[00:09:15.615 --> 00:09:16.576]  That's not tyrannical.
[00:09:18.447 --> 00:09:26.055]  You know, things such as paper guns and bubble guns, those are the real threats to your and your family's personal safety.
[00:09:26.335 --> 00:09:27.016]  We'll move on now.
[00:09:27.476 --> 00:09:31.440]  Prominent gun control advocates compare firearms owners to Nazis.
[00:09:31.801 --> 00:09:33.102]  Now, this is just more of what we've heard.
[00:09:33.382 --> 00:09:39.689]  We've heard that if you own a firearm, you're KKK, you're racist, you're whatever, and now these people are saying that you're a Nazi.
[00:09:40.478 --> 00:09:45.743]  The event was labeled a forum for guns and public safety in a space for real conversation.
[00:09:46.083 --> 00:09:51.208]  However, it quickly became clear that the organizers were in favor of strict gun control.
[00:09:51.648 --> 00:09:56.673]  Speakers included Mark Walsh, campaign director for the Illinois Council Against Handgun Violence.
[00:09:57.794 --> 00:09:59.255]  Why do they even have a council?
[00:09:59.635 --> 00:10:02.036]  Lee Goodman for the Stop Conceal Carry Coalition.
[00:10:02.076 --> 00:10:04.017]  Oh, I'm sure good things are being done there.
[00:10:04.377 --> 00:10:11.399]  And Northfield resident Jennifer Bishop Jenkins of the Million Moms March and her husband, author and gun control advocate Bill Jenkins.
[00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:20.403]  Things really got heated, however, when Jenkins displayed a photograph of a Nazi rally on screen with the title, This is what a gun show looks like.
[00:10:21.183 --> 00:10:23.324]  And just more of the same that we've been seeing, you see things like
[00:10:23.652 --> 00:10:25.653]  The Stop Concealed Carry Coalition.
[00:10:25.894 --> 00:10:27.615]  I mean, you guys have nothing better to do.
[00:10:28.035 --> 00:10:37.562]  But anyway, speaking of things that people did have better things to do this past weekend, people went to their local Capitol buildings and expressed their concern over the 23 Obama executive actions.
[00:10:37.882 --> 00:10:43.106]  And one of the people at these so-called rallies was a gentleman who attended Tiananmen Square.
[00:10:43.466 --> 00:10:46.048]  He was a live witness to the tragedies that happened there.
[00:10:46.068 --> 00:10:47.089]  So let's take a look at that clip.
[00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:50.542]  23 years ago, I was a freshman year at college.
[00:10:50.882 --> 00:10:54.805]  I was exercising my freedom of speech and assembly in Tiananmen Square.
[00:10:55.346 --> 00:11:04.352]  When a government turns criminal, when a government turns deranged, the body counts will not be 5, 10, or even 20.
[00:11:04.592 --> 00:11:08.115]  It will be in the hundreds, like in Tiananmen Square.
[00:11:09.035 --> 00:11:15.260]  It will be in the millions, as proved by the 90-year rule of the Chinese Communist Party.
[00:11:16.181 --> 00:11:23.292]  So a stern warning from somebody who actually faced down communism in Tiananmen Square, and I believe we have some footage that we can show you right there.
[00:11:23.312 --> 00:11:30.123]  And this guy, he said the Chinese government has things in their constitution such as free speech, which is all laughable.
[00:11:30.143 --> 00:11:30.964]  You heard the people laugh.
[00:11:31.385 --> 00:11:31.485]  Yes.
[00:11:49.211 --> 00:11:53.252]  We have this right and there's an example of somebody saying, don't give up your rights.
[00:11:53.692 --> 00:11:55.132]  Now we move now to our last story.
[00:11:55.692 --> 00:11:58.273]  TSA not eliminating x-ray body scanners.
[00:11:58.293 --> 00:12:05.634]  You guys probably saw the report last week where we talked about, you know, in some way it was a victory to get these things out of the out of the airports.
[00:12:05.954 --> 00:12:09.715]  We kind of had a feeling that they were going to try to pull something and yes they did.
[00:12:10.035 --> 00:12:10.615]  Let's take a look.
[00:12:10.915 --> 00:12:16.936]  Contrary to reports last week that the TSA is eliminating its expensive fleet of x-ray body scanners from airports,
[00:12:17.336 --> 00:12:23.345]  The federal agency signed a contract months ago with a separate company to provide this very same machines.
[00:12:23.926 --> 00:12:29.655]  However, the TSA merely announced that it had ended its $5 million contract with Rapiscan.
[00:12:30.291 --> 00:12:34.074]  Not that the x-ray devices will be gone for good.
[00:12:34.474 --> 00:12:39.277]  In addition, the rapid scan machines will merely be relocated to other government agencies.
[00:12:39.718 --> 00:12:41.299]  Get ready to see those other places.
[00:12:41.759 --> 00:12:52.266]  The TSA will also continue to use its millimeter wave scanners that pose a threat to health because they emit terahertz photons which can quote unzip DNA.
[00:12:52.466 --> 00:12:55.808]  That pretty much to me sounds like something out of Star Trek.
[00:12:56.089 --> 00:12:57.670]  They're trying to unzip your DNA.
[00:12:59.651 --> 00:13:01.672]  Yeah, more of what the same you always hear.
[00:13:02.312 --> 00:13:04.312]  Always take these reports with a grain of salt.
[00:13:04.372 --> 00:13:12.995]  We figured they were going to try to do something I thought they were going to get rid of the scanners and do a more hands-on pat-down, but it seems like they have something worse.
[00:13:13.035 --> 00:13:15.456]  They just traded companies pretty much so to speak.
[00:13:15.516 --> 00:13:21.118]  So continue to film the TSA, film your pat-downs, and keep fighting for your freedom.
[00:13:21.198 --> 00:13:22.518]  Now this is actually our last story.
[00:13:22.538 --> 00:13:23.558]  I jumped the gun a little bit.
[00:13:24.039 --> 00:13:28.540]  Now this is an example of, you know, I support the troops, but we shouldn't support
[00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:32.063]  Support them blindly, meaning we shouldn't ignore things like this.
[00:13:32.523 --> 00:13:35.666]  Air Force calls number of sexual assaults appalling.
[00:13:36.067 --> 00:13:44.735]  General Mark Welsh, the Air Force Chief of Staff, said that there were 796 reported cases ranging from inappropriate touching to rape.
[00:13:45.295 --> 00:13:53.724]  The 2012 figure is nearly a 30% increase from the 2011 when there were 614 cases reported.
[00:13:54.185 --> 00:14:01.072]  Welsh's testimony before the House of Armed Committee Services underscores the challenges it and many other military branches face
[00:14:01.522 --> 00:14:03.563]  When it comes to stopping sexual assaults.
[00:14:03.983 --> 00:14:09.326]  And what's really disturbing about this, the article points out, many of these sexual assaults were done by fellow airmen.
[00:14:09.627 --> 00:14:13.989]  That's what I'm saying, you know, you can support the troops, but don't turn a blind eye to things like this.
[00:14:14.069 --> 00:14:16.190]  People are being sexually assaulted, being raped.
[00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:18.251]  And it's not just women, some of these are men too.
[00:14:18.291 --> 00:14:20.452]  Those cases are much less reported.
[00:14:20.753 --> 00:14:26.176]  But it happens to men as well, and definitely hope that these people can get some justice, because these are the people protecting us.
[00:14:26.476 --> 00:14:30.118]  We should fight to protect their freedoms while they are protecting us.
[00:14:30.538 --> 00:14:32.461]  Now let's move now to our quote of the day.
[00:14:32.881 --> 00:14:36.706]  This from our Vice President and Chief Gun Grabber Joe Biden.
[00:14:37.222 --> 00:14:41.145]  Barack Obama ain't taking my shotguns, so don't buy that malarkey.
[00:14:41.586 --> 00:14:44.928]  If he tries to fool with my Beretta, he's got a problem.
[00:14:45.289 --> 00:14:47.531]  That from Joe Biden back in 2008.
[00:14:48.071 --> 00:14:55.357]  And I'm sure Barack Obama won't fool with Mr. Biden's Beretta, because as we know, they do selectively enforce these gun grabs.
[00:14:55.457 --> 00:15:05.025]  They will stay, I'm sure, armed with their bodyguards and whatever else kind of security they have, while you, the peasant citizen, are disarmed of your rights.
[00:15:05.525 --> 00:15:05.946]  I think so.
[00:15:20.382 --> 00:15:23.245]  After this break, I'll be back here in studio with Melissa Melton.
[00:15:23.485 --> 00:15:25.426]  She'll be breaking down various crime statistics.
[00:15:25.627 --> 00:15:30.671]  I know you guys heard a lot of things from various pundits and talk shows saying, this is what the crime statistic is.
[00:15:30.691 --> 00:15:31.532]  No, this is what it is.
[00:15:31.852 --> 00:15:33.593]  So she's going to be here in studio to break it down.
[00:15:33.653 --> 00:15:37.096]  She was also on the Alex Jones Radio Show explaining that as well.
[00:15:37.376 --> 00:15:41.960]  But if you'd like to support our broadcast, stop by PrisonPlanet.tv, get yourself a subscription.
[00:15:42.261 --> 00:15:43.682]  You can also get a free trial.

[00:15:48.664 --> 00:15:49.425]  Many great reports.
[00:15:49.445 --> 00:15:50.986]  You saw David Ortiz right there.
[00:15:51.066 --> 00:15:54.227]  Many special reports and different things that you can look at on there.
[00:15:54.528 --> 00:15:58.089]  And also, stop by the InfoWars shop and pick up the InfoWars magazine.
[00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:01.031]  And we'll be back right after this message with Melissa Melton.
[00:16:05.913 --> 00:16:08.355]  I really enjoy it when the globalists try to poison us.
[00:16:08.515 --> 00:16:11.977]  And well, we resist them via a free market system.
[00:16:12.927 --> 00:16:19.876]  Hello my fellow info warriors, Alex Jones here introducing you to the ProPure family of gravity-fed filters.
[00:16:20.337 --> 00:16:27.286]  Now, you know that the globalists are filling our water with radioactive isotopes, fluoride, lead, mercury, arsenic.
[00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:37.337]  And one of the few systems that can efficiently and economically remove or reduce down to non-detectable levels these poisons are gravity-fed filters.
[00:16:37.778 --> 00:16:40.060]  And ProPure is the top of the line.
[00:16:40.561 --> 00:16:45.105]  Their filters are impregnated with silver, a natural antibiotic,
[00:16:45.786 --> 00:16:49.149]  On top of that, they're bigger so they filter faster.
[00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:52.553]  You don't have to prime these the first time you use them.
[00:16:52.933 --> 00:16:53.594]  It's amazing!
[00:16:53.634 --> 00:16:59.419]  Go to InfoWars.com and click on the shopping cart link to see the entire family of these babies.
[00:17:00.447 --> 00:17:05.451]  Now, the fluoride they add to our water is so tiny that most filters can't cut it out.
[00:17:05.711 --> 00:17:11.675]  But ProPure has their system that will, again, reduce it to non-detectable levels.
[00:17:11.795 --> 00:17:13.656]  Almost get all of it out of there.
[00:17:13.997 --> 00:17:14.977]  That's also available.
[00:17:15.298 --> 00:17:27.266]  And if you look at the different systems they offer, the ProPure Big Brush Finish is on a stand, so it's easier on a table or at your restaurant or wherever you have it to go up with a glass or a mug and fill it up.
[00:17:27.366 --> 00:17:31.428]  Then there's this big baby right here, the ProPure King large version.
[00:17:31.668 --> 00:17:33.769]  Got a lot of different options that come with it.
[00:17:34.129 --> 00:17:38.451]  Also, they have the ProPure Big, probably one of the best values out there.
[00:17:38.711 --> 00:17:40.712]  And of course, it's burnished stainless steel.
[00:17:41.072 --> 00:17:48.476]  And then, what I use on my RV, something that's great for your hunting cabin or the back porch, is the ProPure Traveler.
[00:17:48.996 --> 00:17:54.181]  Small and portable but packs a huge punch, cleans out all that garbage.
[00:17:54.582 --> 00:18:01.268]  They also have a glass site spigot so you don't have to take the top off and look in the bottom area to see how much water.
[00:18:01.308 --> 00:18:04.772]  You can see how fast it's filtering with this optional system.
[00:18:05.012 --> 00:18:05.673]  The Globalist
[00:18:06.113 --> 00:18:07.855]  Obviously, you're hitting us through our water.
[00:18:08.155 --> 00:18:09.857]  It's time to take control of our lives.
[00:18:10.097 --> 00:18:18.004]  It's time to not give our children and families these poisons, and these systems cut it down to non-detectable levels across the board.
[00:18:18.364 --> 00:18:20.606]  ProPure is the name.
[00:18:21.127 --> 00:18:23.129]  I only promote what I believe in.
[00:18:23.749 --> 00:18:27.313]  And I use ProPure in my home and my office.
[00:18:27.613 --> 00:18:31.878]  And I recommend that you check out the information on ProPure at Infowars.com.
[00:18:32.098 --> 00:18:38.324]  We already have the lowest price at Infowars.com on the ProPure gravity filter system.
[00:18:39.105 --> 00:18:47.093]  But when you add in the 10% off when InfoWarriors use the product code WATER at InfoWars.com, nobody can top it.
[00:18:47.474 --> 00:18:48.835]  So again, it's a win-win-win.
[00:18:48.895 --> 00:18:57.584]  Stop drinking the poison water, checkmate the globalists when it comes to your health, and support InfoWars.com and the work we're doing here.
[00:18:57.924 --> 00:19:02.207]  You know, many revolutionaries rob banks and things and kidnap people for funds.
[00:19:02.607 --> 00:19:07.189]  We promote in the free market the products we use that are about preparedness.
[00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:17.736]  That's how we fund this revolution against the New World Order in our move to restore our constitutional republic and the spirit of 1776 worldwide.
[00:19:18.096 --> 00:19:19.637]  Check it out at InfoWars.com.
[00:19:20.137 --> 00:19:28.806]  ProPure, top of the line, number one, most powerful and effective and economical gravity-fed water system in the world.
[00:19:29.106 --> 00:19:32.830]  ProPure, available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:35.332]  Don't forget product code WATER to save 10%.
[00:19:36.513 --> 00:19:39.156]  It's the latest generation, years in development.
[00:19:39.596 --> 00:19:41.779]  ProPure is the name.
[00:19:47.694 --> 00:19:50.757]  Christy Hightower here with a quick Planet InfoWars update.
[00:19:51.297 --> 00:19:54.520]  I want to start this off with a quick quote from Thomas Edison.
[00:19:55.161 --> 00:19:59.124]  Now, there are three great essential things to achieve anything worthwhile.
[00:20:00.045 --> 00:20:01.066]  First, hard work.
[00:20:01.764 --> 00:20:03.164]  Second, stick-to-it-ness.
[00:20:03.424 --> 00:20:06.005]  I don't know if that's technically a word, but stick-to-it-ness.
[00:20:06.505 --> 00:20:08.025]  And three, common sense.
[00:20:08.606 --> 00:20:11.426]  Now, I think this last one, we all know, is not quite so common.
[00:20:11.766 --> 00:20:15.247]  And that actually takes us to our first article that I want to feature.
[00:20:15.287 --> 00:20:18.388]  It's, Too Big to Fail or Too Big to Succeed.
[00:20:18.888 --> 00:20:19.708]  This is by Blue.
[00:20:20.168 --> 00:20:28.290]  And he basically just kind of rants a little bit about the big banks and how we were tricked and told that, you know, they're too big to fail, our lives are going to be changed forever.
[00:20:28.865 --> 00:20:31.726]  Well, he proposes the idea of the free market, essentially.
[00:20:32.147 --> 00:20:36.008]  Too big to succeed, they all fail, and what springs up in its place?
[00:20:36.288 --> 00:20:42.832]  But small business owners, people that come to the table, they bring something that changes things, that makes things better.
[00:20:42.972 --> 00:20:44.672]  So, go comment on that.
[00:20:46.471 --> 00:20:51.075]  I'd like to read those comments actually, kind of what your strategy is or what your thoughts are on that.
[00:20:51.776 --> 00:20:56.379]  And the next article I actually want to touch on is called Licensed to Live.
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:59.242]  And this is actually by Iron Eagle.
[00:21:00.002 --> 00:21:07.108]  And it basically says, did you notice there's a license for this, there's a permit for that, there's a certificate you have to achieve for that.
[00:21:08.009 --> 00:21:13.514]  She kind of touches on the idea that, you know, half of these things you can just simply be an apprentice.
[00:21:14.307 --> 00:21:18.509]  Plumbing, or welding, or shoot, even being a doctor, I guess.
[00:21:19.009 --> 00:21:20.170]  They all have to be apprentices.
[00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:25.792]  So she actually does talk about the only license that kind of makes sense are for the public health.
[00:21:26.092 --> 00:21:28.053]  But then there's that law in that gray zone.
[00:21:28.473 --> 00:21:33.856]  So go and read that article, License to Live, in the economics section.
[00:21:33.996 --> 00:21:42.900]  So this actually kind of, I started it out a little different, but the very end of this last segment, I wanted to touch on the mission in the Dating Freedom Lovers group.
[00:21:43.781 --> 00:21:48.584]  I'm really excited because February 14th is coming up, so everyone's looking for love.
[00:21:48.644 --> 00:21:50.905]  The Patriots, you know, you don't want to be lonely.
[00:21:50.966 --> 00:21:51.946]  Nobody likes to be lonely.
[00:21:52.566 --> 00:21:59.371]  And, well anyways, it's really hard, especially when you're awake, to find somebody that you can talk to and connect to about certain ideas.
[00:22:00.391 --> 00:22:05.896]  It actually takes us to the Dating Freedom Lovers group, and check it out, this is actually Daphne.
[00:22:05.956 --> 00:22:12.602]  She was part of our initial Planet InfoWars launch, so I figured it's fitting that I put her on this update.
[00:22:12.962 --> 00:22:22.310]  But basically, send us your picture, it'll go where her picture is, and your name, and try to keep it under 150 characters if you can, because there's only so much room.
[00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:25.152]  So she just kind of gave a quick description.
[00:22:25.252 --> 00:22:26.013]  This is what I'm looking for.
[00:22:26.073 --> 00:22:26.834]  This is who I am.
[00:22:26.854 --> 00:22:28.455]  And then contact her.
[00:22:28.495 --> 00:22:35.143]  So make sure that when you do the mission, send us your username, which is the at Disco Daphne for her.
[00:22:36.329 --> 00:22:46.295]  Um, and just send your picture, quick little details, and your username to mods, M-O-D-S, underscore love, at InfoWars.com.
[00:22:46.956 --> 00:22:56.441]  And, um, us, we'll, uh, we'll take a look at it, we'll put it together, and we'll hopefully get to change them out every day, maybe even, maybe in a couple of times a day if we get enough of them.
[00:22:56.501 --> 00:22:58.543]  So, so far, really good response.
[00:22:58.583 --> 00:22:59.723]  Thank you guys for sending them in.
[00:22:59.743 --> 00:23:02.045]  And, um, I love it.
[00:23:02.565 --> 00:23:03.666]  I absolutely love it.
[00:23:03.726 --> 00:23:05.707]  It's making me really happy to see all these people, like,
[00:23:06.208 --> 00:23:08.593]  Excited about who they are and excited about who they want to meet.
[00:23:09.915 --> 00:23:10.897]  So I look forward to those.
[00:23:11.519 --> 00:23:13.603]  Patriots, keep on talking, because we're listening.
[00:23:20.876 --> 00:23:25.400]  Alex Jones here with a message that could revolutionize health in this country.
[00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:31.545]  Going back about a year and a half ago, I began to learn about the incredible health effects of longevity products.
[00:23:31.925 --> 00:23:35.728]  Erin Dykes lost 92 pounds.
[00:23:35.748 --> 00:23:37.550]  We're going to show you some before and afters.
[00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:39.731]  Aaron, break down what happened.
[00:23:39.771 --> 00:23:40.332]  Your story.
[00:23:40.612 --> 00:23:45.676]  I've worked really hard with diet and exercise to try to lose weight, but I just didn't get the results.
[00:23:45.716 --> 00:23:46.576]  It just didn't happen.
[00:23:46.877 --> 00:23:49.479]  Then I saw what you were doing with Infowarsteam.com.
[00:23:49.959 --> 00:23:53.762]  I wasn't even trying to lose weight, but I got it because I wanted to feel better energy.
[00:23:53.802 --> 00:23:54.742]  I wanted that nutrition.
[00:23:54.762 --> 00:23:55.503]  Didn't even understand
[00:23:55.623 --> 00:23:58.405]  And how that could kickstart my own weight loss goals.
[00:23:58.525 --> 00:24:00.286]  But the products did that for me.
[00:24:00.626 --> 00:24:06.350]  I found myself suddenly losing weight, more energetic, wanting to exercise, wanting to eat the right foods.
[00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:08.391]  And they don't even advertise it as weight loss!
[00:24:08.711 --> 00:24:12.273]  I want to challenge our radio listeners to go to Infowarsteam.com.
[00:24:12.793 --> 00:24:18.337]  Sign up as a distributor and get wholesale pricing discounts at Infowarsteam.com.
[00:24:47.017 --> 00:24:47.619]  And welcome back.
[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:50.787]  For the interview portion of our show, we'll be joined by Melissa Melton.
[00:24:51.067 --> 00:24:53.914]  But first, let's take a look at this clip of Melissa on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:56.818 --> 00:24:59.799]  The crime statistics are very accurate because they're compiled locally.
[00:25:00.319 --> 00:25:03.680]  And then they're cross-referenced by a lot of different universities and others.
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:07.101]  But the uniform crime statistics, go over these for people.
[00:25:07.281 --> 00:25:11.502]  Well, these statistics come from 18,000 law enforcement agencies across the whole country.
[00:25:11.562 --> 00:25:16.663]  And you're talking city, college, county, state, tribal, federal agencies all over.
[00:25:16.743 --> 00:25:19.924]  So 18,000, they compile this data every single year.
[00:25:20.204 --> 00:25:21.784]  And they've been putting it up- And it's from court records.
[00:25:21.824 --> 00:25:24.485]  It's all filed, the arrest, what was reported.
[00:25:24.565 --> 00:25:28.728]  Report it to the FBI through their reporting system that they've had for many decades.
[00:25:28.748 --> 00:25:31.250]  So you've got 18,000 groups that can cross-check their info.
[00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:33.171]  It's been found to be some of the most accurate numbers out there.
[00:25:33.191 --> 00:25:34.172]  This is what everybody uses.
[00:25:34.192 --> 00:25:36.714]  This is our most consistent crime data that we have in this country.
[00:25:37.134 --> 00:25:37.995]  It comes from these numbers.
[00:25:38.155 --> 00:25:40.697]  In fact, if they do anything, they've been caught inflating it to get money.
[00:25:40.977 --> 00:25:42.959]  So it's probably even lower than what they're saying, but go over it.
[00:25:43.419 --> 00:25:53.166]  Well, okay, so what they have up right now is from 1992, and if you use a basic calculation for percentages, you'll see that violent crime, we'll start with that, has been cut in half since 1992.
[00:25:53.206 --> 00:25:54.467]  The 1992 violent crime rate per 100,000 people was 757.7.
[00:25:54.547 --> 00:25:55.728]  If you subtract the 2011 violent crime rate,
[00:26:00.811 --> 00:26:00.971]  That's 386.3.
[00:26:01.011 --> 00:26:01.271]  You get 371.4.
[00:26:01.312 --> 00:26:03.033]  You divide this by your original 1992 rate.
[00:26:03.073 --> 00:26:03.794]  That gives you .4902.
[00:26:04.174 --> 00:26:07.737]  Multiply that out to find your percentage and you're going to have a decrease of 49.02% in violent crime between 1992 and 2011.
[00:26:07.837 --> 00:26:08.157]  Incredible!
[00:26:08.197 --> 00:26:11.240]  And the murder rate shows actually the same decrease from 1992 to 2011.
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:11.620]  In 1992 the rate was 9.3.
[00:26:25.311 --> 00:26:26.993]  In 2011, it fell to 4.7.
[00:26:27.774 --> 00:26:28.775]  If you subtract, you get 4.6.
[00:26:29.515 --> 00:26:36.162]  Divide that by your 1992 base rate, and again, you get a 49% decrease in murder rates in this country from 1992 to 2011.
[00:26:37.283 --> 00:26:38.264]  So it's cut in half.
[00:26:38.584 --> 00:26:39.405]  We have half.
[00:26:40.186 --> 00:26:47.773]  And actually, all the major crime categories that the FBI does, collects all this data for, have dropped significantly between 1992 and 2011.
[00:26:50.015 --> 00:26:52.898]  Um, as you can see here, I've got all the numbers up there.
[00:26:53.418 --> 00:26:55.280]  Every single one of those numbers has dropped.
[00:26:55.821 --> 00:26:56.481]  Every single one.
[00:26:56.842 --> 00:26:57.462]  Every one.
[00:26:57.502 --> 00:27:00.865]  The only crime statistics, we should do another report on this, is the petty crime.
[00:27:00.885 --> 00:27:04.889]  Because criminals are afraid to home invade, carjack now, or knock a woman on the head.
[00:27:04.909 --> 00:27:07.332]  And that was just prolific decades ago.
[00:27:07.632 --> 00:27:08.953]  Because they're scared of getting blown away.
[00:27:09.013 --> 00:27:09.413]  Now you look at...
[00:27:09.974 --> 00:27:13.115]  What you ought to do in the next few days is do this versus British crime rates.
[00:27:13.415 --> 00:27:14.295]  They've got those numbers.
[00:27:14.435 --> 00:27:17.636]  Just the muggings, the stabbings are just off the charts.
[00:27:17.656 --> 00:27:19.857]  We have a much higher rate of rape there than we do here also.
[00:27:20.477 --> 00:27:21.678]  Their rape is going off the charts.
[00:27:21.718 --> 00:27:24.158]  I mean, a lot of their stuff, their violent crime is going off the charts.
[00:27:24.238 --> 00:27:24.799]  It's much higher.
[00:27:24.819 --> 00:27:27.459]  They estimate in many states a third of women are packing heat in their purse.
[00:27:27.479 --> 00:27:29.060]  You're not going to try to rape her in the parking garage.
[00:27:29.798 --> 00:27:34.601]  Well, they're calling Britain the violent crime capital of the UK because it's higher.
[00:27:34.641 --> 00:27:40.845]  Their rates are higher for violent crime than, I believe, Australia, South Africa, here, and Canada.
[00:27:40.865 --> 00:27:42.066]  Can we cover all the statistics?
[00:27:42.627 --> 00:27:48.150]  Yeah, that's all the graphics that I have here, all these different statistics, but I mean, all of these are consistently down.
[00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:49.711]  Every single thing is consistently down.
[00:27:49.811 --> 00:27:54.955]  Anybody can go, they can get these reports, they can see, they've put them up every year for the last 20 years.
[00:27:55.475 --> 00:27:59.218]  So they can go to the FBI, they can download all of it, they can download it for their state,
[00:28:00.338 --> 00:28:03.100]  And then you can double check.
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:06.441]  Let's say you live in Fresno, California.
[00:28:06.461 --> 00:28:10.744]  Or let's say you live in Clearwater, Florida.
[00:28:10.784 --> 00:28:12.404]  You can go check those numbers.
[00:28:12.564 --> 00:28:14.045]  Check it with the newspaper.
[00:28:14.165 --> 00:28:16.847]  And they do this every single year.
[00:28:17.327 --> 00:28:21.389]  And like I said, this is used every time a criminal justice study is done, it's pretty much used.
[00:28:21.889 --> 00:28:26.412]  Every class I had in grad school, we used this data because this is the most consistent data that we have.
[00:28:26.833 --> 00:28:31.156]  And some people like to detract and argue about this data and say, well, crime is underreported.
[00:28:31.576 --> 00:28:36.140]  But if anything, I would say this is the... It was underreported then.
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:39.042]  I mean, there are obviously some unreported crimes, but that's a constant.
[00:28:39.142 --> 00:28:39.442]  Yeah.
[00:28:39.582 --> 00:28:42.885]  In the pool, a lot of statistics I've read have shown it's more reported now.
[00:28:42.905 --> 00:28:43.125]  Exactly.
[00:28:43.145 --> 00:28:44.726]  Because it's easier to report because of the internet.
[00:28:44.746 --> 00:28:45.407]  It's easier to report.
[00:28:45.567 --> 00:28:47.728]  And they let you do it with anonymity, which is unconstitutional.
[00:28:47.929 --> 00:28:49.670]  In the past, you had to go face your accuser.
[00:28:49.810 --> 00:28:50.070]  Right.
[00:28:50.151 --> 00:28:59.003]  And over the years, the FBI has made their system of reporting from these local agencies easier for them to report their data as well and have a much more consistent... Well, everybody knows there's less crime.
[00:28:59.023 --> 00:29:03.449]  When I was growing up in Dallas, I remember some weeks when there were like 60-something dead.
[00:29:04.386 --> 00:29:08.569]  And because, you know, in the 60s and 70s, everything got real anti-gun, and gunnership went way down.
[00:29:08.829 --> 00:29:10.790]  They were winning their war, everybody was getting rid of their guns.
[00:29:11.291 --> 00:29:15.373]  Crime exploded all over, but then guns came back, and criminals are scared.
[00:29:15.554 --> 00:29:16.914]  But any police will tell you that.
[00:29:17.555 --> 00:29:20.897]  I mean, look, you home-invade in Texas, you're probably going to die.
[00:29:22.198 --> 00:29:28.602]  Yeah, I mean, I read a statistic, and I didn't bring this one in here with me, but assault weapons are only used in what, 0.6% of all murders?
[00:29:32.691 --> 00:29:35.132]  All right, Melissa, we just watched that clip of you on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:29:35.172 --> 00:29:35.473]  Welcome.
[00:29:35.913 --> 00:29:36.233]  Hi.
[00:29:36.353 --> 00:29:37.074]  Thanks, Jakari.
[00:29:37.134 --> 00:29:43.417]  Well, since I talked about the UCR today, the FBI crime statistics, I thought we would go ahead and take a look at some other crime statistics.
[00:29:43.437 --> 00:29:43.497]  OK.
[00:29:43.897 --> 00:29:47.780]  So we're going to start here at first with the Home Office Statistical Bulletin.
[00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:50.561]  This is the crime report that comes out of the UK.
[00:29:51.242 --> 00:29:54.324]  And this is crime in England and Wales, 2010-2011.
[00:29:54.624 --> 00:29:58.306]  They actually do police-recorded crime and then a British crime survey on top of that.
[00:29:58.866 --> 00:30:00.527]  And I just want to take a look at some of their rates.
[00:30:00.567 --> 00:30:02.148]  We saw how our rates are dropping.
[00:30:02.188 --> 00:30:03.428]  Let's see what their rates are doing.
[00:30:03.988 --> 00:30:06.390]  We have homicide is up 4%.
[00:30:06.450 --> 00:30:07.050]  Right there.
[00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:09.551]  We've got rape of a female up 5%.
[00:30:09.631 --> 00:30:10.611]  Rape of a male up 12%.
[00:30:10.691 --> 00:30:11.052]  Right here.
[00:30:17.205 --> 00:30:20.927]  Burglary is up 14% and all violence is up 6%.
[00:30:21.007 --> 00:30:21.647]  Right.
[00:30:22.167 --> 00:30:37.954]  And so it's going up and actually there's criticism of this because apparently the former acting head of the Home Office's police research group estimated in 2007 that the BCS was actually under-reporting crime by 3 million incidents because they cap the number of crimes that one person can have by 5.
[00:30:38.714 --> 00:30:40.915]  So if 5 crimes happen to you, that's all you get.
[00:30:40.955 --> 00:30:44.236]  So if the 6th crime is you being stabbed or shot, that's it.
[00:30:44.316 --> 00:30:44.676]  You're done.
[00:30:44.816 --> 00:30:46.177]  Similar to what Larry Pratt said.
[00:30:46.477 --> 00:30:46.877]  Exactly.
[00:30:46.897 --> 00:30:56.005]  And it says here that if that error is correct, it means that violent crime might actually be at 4.4 million incidences a year, which is an 82% increase in the UK.
[00:30:56.386 --> 00:30:58.567]  So their stuff is all over the place.
[00:30:58.968 --> 00:31:01.270]  But even if you don't look at RUCR and their
[00:31:01.850 --> 00:31:02.270]  That's right.
[00:31:24.235 --> 00:31:24.595]  Exactly.
[00:31:24.615 --> 00:31:27.017]  So we're five times bigger, but they have more rape there.
[00:31:27.118 --> 00:31:29.700]  And these are the things that you don't hear about from these gun control advocates.
[00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:37.026]  They won't say, well, the UK has less gun crime, which is true, but they ignore violent crimes, rapes, muggings, all things such as that.
[00:31:37.046 --> 00:31:38.427]  And I see you have more than that.
[00:31:38.588 --> 00:31:38.828]  Yeah.
[00:31:38.868 --> 00:31:48.276]  Well, they call the UK the violent crime capital of the Europe because it's got higher rates there than all these other places, South Africa, even Australia, even.
[00:31:48.316 --> 00:31:49.357]  I mean, it's crazy.
[00:31:49.797 --> 00:31:54.740]  And so for him, for Pierce Morgan to sit on his show and just throw out these random statistics, where is he even getting it from?
[00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:55.801]  He never cites his source.
[00:31:56.561 --> 00:32:02.665]  The last thing I saw actually had to do with assault weapons bans, and this comes from a writer, Frank Victoria, on his blog.
[00:32:02.685 --> 00:32:08.369]  And he put up this shot here that I thought was pretty interesting about Dianne Feinstein's new assault weapons ban.
[00:32:08.389 --> 00:32:11.631]  I don't know if we have that graphic we could show viewers.
[00:32:12.111 --> 00:32:18.435]  But it says, under Senator Dianne Feinstein's new assault weapons ban, the following shotguns would be legal and illegal.
[00:32:18.915 --> 00:32:19.075]  I'm good.
[00:32:39.326 --> 00:32:39.847]  That's right.
[00:32:57.850 --> 00:32:58.070]  Exactly.
[00:32:58.230 --> 00:33:02.894]  And even when it is homicides, it's something like 70%, it's a really high number, is gang related crime.
[00:33:03.274 --> 00:33:16.283]  So what they're telling you, they're not giving you the facts, they're just throwing out random things, and we don't know where these statistics are coming from when these media figureheads come out, and when the politicians come out and they throw statistics at people, they seemingly never cite their sources.
[00:33:16.403 --> 00:33:18.544]  It seems like they purposely don't cite their sources.
[00:33:18.964 --> 00:33:22.186]  And the thing of an assault weapon is most people don't even know what an assault weapon is.
[00:33:22.726 --> 00:33:30.550]  According to their definition, y'all say their definition, it could be something as simple as a pistol grip, just like what you showed, what we see right there on the screen.
[00:33:30.910 --> 00:33:33.352]  Those are the same gun, just one has a pistol grip.
[00:33:33.632 --> 00:33:41.616]  A pistol grip doesn't, you know, make the gun... It doesn't change the amount of rounds you can load into your gun.
[00:33:41.636 --> 00:33:44.077]  I mean, it doesn't make the gun shoot any faster.
[00:33:44.177 --> 00:33:45.718]  It's just a feature of a gun.
[00:33:46.252 --> 00:33:53.658]  Well, and the thing is, according to FBI crime statistics, our crime has been going down substantially every year for the last 20 years.
[00:33:54.299 --> 00:34:06.509]  And the FBI, unlike some of these other places where people are getting their statistics, like think tanks and special interest groups, the FBI isn't lobbying for policy like some of these other groups are, that are coming out with their random, strange statistics, which we don't know where they got it from.
[00:34:06.529 --> 00:34:10.292]  The FBI collects that stuff from 18,000 law enforcement agencies all over the country.
[00:34:10.312 --> 00:34:11.393]  They've been doing it for years.
[00:34:11.933 --> 00:34:15.096]  So, it is the standard in our statistics and they can't ignore it.
[00:34:15.196 --> 00:34:20.261]  So, because they can't ignore it, they go and find all this other stuff and cite that, but they don't tell you the source.
[00:34:20.281 --> 00:34:21.702]  They just throw it out there.
[00:34:21.742 --> 00:34:23.544]  This many people and that percent and whatever.
[00:34:23.824 --> 00:34:25.205]  They could have made that up five minutes ago.
[00:34:25.225 --> 00:34:26.847]  Yeah, definitely.
[00:34:26.907 --> 00:34:27.968]  Great report, Melissa.
[00:34:28.208 --> 00:34:31.291]  Definitely enjoyed hearing that, a continuation of what you did on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:34:31.311 --> 00:34:32.472]  Alright, thanks Melissa.
[00:34:32.712 --> 00:34:34.754]  Well, that's it for the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:34:34.814 --> 00:34:36.856]  I'm your host, Jakari Jackson, and we'll see you tomorrow night.
