[00:00:05.134 --> 00:00:09.296]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.956 --> 00:00:10.757]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.537 --> 00:00:12.438]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.098 --> 00:00:16.700]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.342]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.506 --> 00:00:38.648]  Well, I tell you, I love it when we get somebody like this around.
[00:00:38.668 --> 00:00:51.055]  I feel like I know him so good because I've interviewed him probably 20, 30 times over the years, and I've played so many clubs with him on the air, and I also like to watch his church services from Montana.
[00:00:51.075 --> 00:00:51.916]  He used to be in Florida.
[00:00:52.316 --> 00:01:00.681]  He gave a really good one that I saw a couple weeks ago, talking about the connection from the past to now, which really resonated with me, but he went through the Bible verses.
[00:01:02.014 --> 00:01:06.917]  Of everything our ancestors did against tyranny is for naught if we don't continue it.
[00:01:06.937 --> 00:01:07.778]  It's like electricity.
[00:01:08.278 --> 00:01:17.023]  And you think about your grandmother, her grandmother, your grandfather, going back, they all loved that person, took care of them, and then the next person was born, and it's like electricity.
[00:01:17.263 --> 00:01:22.887]  There's a genetic line, but also a training, everything spiritual, right back to people 50 generations ago.
[00:01:24.188 --> 00:01:25.289]  A hundred generations ago.
[00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:27.590]  And it's just amazing.
[00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.773]  But I'm already going off into his sermon on that.
[00:01:30.813 --> 00:01:34.116]  Perhaps tonight on the Nightly News we can get into some of the bigger issues here.
[00:01:34.996 --> 00:01:36.518]  But he's got a new book out.
[00:01:36.558 --> 00:01:40.461]  He's put two books out with his son, his constitutional lawyer, Timothy Baldwin.
[00:01:40.481 --> 00:01:41.582]  Pastor Chuck Baldwin's here.
[00:01:41.882 --> 00:01:43.383]  This is a little short five-minute segment.
[00:01:43.763 --> 00:01:45.845]  Some stations don't carry it, so we'll really come back in a moment.
[00:01:46.225 --> 00:01:52.030]  But the new one is to keep or not to keep why Christians should not give up their guns from a biblical perspective.
[00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.911]  And even if you're not a Christian,
[00:01:53.591 --> 00:01:58.916]  77% of this country says they're a Christian, and they, Billy Graham and his son, you know, turn your guns in.
[00:01:58.936 --> 00:02:02.179]  Oh, please, you know, IRS harass us.
[00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.742]  They are government minions more and more.
[00:02:05.642 --> 00:02:07.404]  And, you know, Chuck knows all these people.
[00:02:07.444 --> 00:02:09.566]  He's been in those big national councils with them and the rest of it.
[00:02:10.347 --> 00:02:13.550]  We're going to talk about how we take the churches back in America today.
[00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:14.651]  I want to get into that.
[00:02:14.711 --> 00:02:15.812]  I want to get into the scandals.
[00:02:16.072 --> 00:02:18.054]  What else do you want to get in today, Chuck?
[00:02:19.068 --> 00:02:20.891]  Alex, first of all, it's great to be with you.
[00:02:21.211 --> 00:02:22.232]  It's good to have you here, my friend.
[00:02:22.253 --> 00:02:23.474]  It's good to see the studio.
[00:02:23.514 --> 00:02:24.436]  Good to see your staff.
[00:02:25.036 --> 00:02:26.959]  Good to see what you're doing here from Austin.
[00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:28.481]  Good to see me stomping around.
[00:02:29.863 --> 00:02:31.225]  See you behind the camera.
[00:02:31.265 --> 00:02:32.386]  It's terrific to be here.
[00:02:32.447 --> 00:02:33.288]  Thank you very much.
[00:02:33.708 --> 00:02:35.210]  And all these issues you're talking about.
[00:02:35.771 --> 00:02:38.852]  ...are the issues that all of us are addressing in our own venues.
[00:02:39.853 --> 00:02:42.273]  We've been in Montana now for about three years and loving it.
[00:02:43.594 --> 00:02:47.976]  Just love what God is doing for us there in the Flathead Valley of Montana.
[00:02:48.336 --> 00:02:50.416]  Got a brand new church up there called Liberty Fellowship.
[00:02:50.977 --> 00:03:00.940]  Alex, it's a non-501c3 church and that's exciting to me because we don't have to worry about any of that and we've got hundreds of people that are coming and attending and excited.
[00:03:03.081 --> 00:03:05.562]  Liberty Fellowship video messages are online.
[00:03:06.022 --> 00:03:07.282]  Thousands of people are watching.
[00:03:07.322 --> 00:03:14.424]  We've got hundreds and hundreds of people that are watching us live every Sunday afternoon as we live stream the broadcast across America.
[00:03:14.444 --> 00:03:16.205]  A lot of people are fed up.
[00:03:16.245 --> 00:03:18.746]  They can't find a church that they can attend.
[00:03:19.386 --> 00:03:21.066]  There's no Patriot pastor in the pulpit.
[00:03:21.487 --> 00:03:25.768]  So they watch us every Sunday afternoon at 2.30 Mountain Time.
[00:03:26.328 --> 00:03:31.470]  And their home or the living room, they have community centers, they have a VFW post, whatever it may be.
[00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:32.550]  They gather around the TV.
[00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.674]  And you're teaching the old, real Christianity, not the new thing.
[00:03:38.034 --> 00:03:42.478]  And you were telling me, I think it was on the phone, that you have a lot of people that aren't even Christians coming now.
[00:03:42.598 --> 00:03:42.778]  Yeah.
[00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:45.601]  Because that's what originally attracted people was the message of liberty.
[00:03:45.881 --> 00:03:47.683]  Where there is the spirit of the Lord, there is liberty.
[00:03:47.723 --> 00:03:47.923]  Right.
[00:03:48.483 --> 00:03:57.291]  And a lot of the people that come and then they don't know the Lord after coming for a little while and they hear the message of truth and the message of liberty from the scripture that's not being preached usually.
[00:03:57.871 --> 00:04:00.612]  They wind up accepting the Lord and becoming a Christian.
[00:04:00.692 --> 00:04:02.293]  So that, you know, that's really exciting.
[00:04:02.313 --> 00:04:03.733]  But you're not beating people over the head with it?
[00:04:03.813 --> 00:04:04.434]  No, we just preach the truth.
[00:04:04.454 --> 00:04:06.595]  It's all these Pharisee preachers that turn everybody away.
[00:04:06.615 --> 00:04:10.656]  We just preach the truth and, you know, all truth comes from Christ.
[00:04:11.196 --> 00:04:12.617]  He is the way, the truth, and the life.
[00:04:13.037 --> 00:04:14.358]  All truth comes from Christ.
[00:04:14.678 --> 00:04:17.039]  And that means all truth ultimately leads to Christ.
[00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:30.196]  So when you preach the truth, and that includes the truth of liberty and freedom and constitutional government and the principles that God has inculcated in his word relative to freedom, when you preach that, it's going to ultimately lead back to Christ.
[00:04:30.276 --> 00:04:31.358]  I mean, it can't help but.
[00:04:32.364 --> 00:04:32.924]  Absolutely.
[00:04:32.964 --> 00:04:34.105]  Chuck Baldwin's our guest.
[00:04:34.125 --> 00:04:35.785]  We're going to get into the IRS scandals.
[00:04:36.126 --> 00:04:43.409]  Benghazi, get his take on the brutal beheading by a Muslim extremist after they ran a British trooper over.
[00:04:44.049 --> 00:04:45.850]  And people are saying that's a false flag.
[00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:46.630]  I don't think it is.
[00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.031]  This is just some morons.
[00:04:49.531 --> 00:04:54.513]  But the West has been radicalizing Islam for the clash of civilizations, and they can take our liberties.
[00:04:54.693 --> 00:04:56.054]  We're going to break that down as well.
[00:04:56.114 --> 00:04:56.594]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.004 --> 00:05:12.310]  With health threats on the rise such as West Nile virus, MRSA, CRE, and now the new bird flu recently discovered in China, there has never been a more crucial time to support your immune system.

[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:48.402]  Supernatural Silver is the number one choice of thousands for improved health and immune system support.

[00:06:04.485 --> 00:06:05.405]  Tyranny is here.
[00:06:05.745 --> 00:06:09.306]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:06:09.406 --> 00:06:11.907]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:06:11.927 --> 00:06:17.328]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[00:06:17.768 --> 00:06:24.033]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:06:24.453 --> 00:06:29.977]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:06:30.437 --> 00:06:34.120]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.563]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:06:38.883 --> 00:06:44.387]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:06:44.827 --> 00:06:47.809]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:49.811]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:06:50.371 --> 00:06:50.851]  It's here.

[00:07:00.106 --> 00:07:01.747]  Introducing Pro-1.
[00:07:01.987 --> 00:07:05.510]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:10.053]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[00:07:10.173 --> 00:07:16.177]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:07:16.297 --> 00:07:27.085]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.
[00:07:27.265 --> 00:07:33.572]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gates we have a discounted at 10% off with promo code water.
[00:07:33.772 --> 00:07:48.729]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands, and
[00:07:48.729 --> 00:07:51.732]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side.
[00:07:51.772 --> 00:07:53.213]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:08:20.069 --> 00:08:41.502]  Well, Pastor Chuck Baldwin is our guest syndicated talk show host, best-selling author, very popular presidential nominee and candidate for the Constitution Party, actually got a lot of national attention, listed in the MIAC Homeland Security Report as an evil extremist, along with Ron Paul and others who do not dare
[00:08:42.438 --> 00:08:43.739]  Dare listen to what he has to say.
[00:08:43.759 --> 00:08:44.499]  It's so horrible.
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:49.483]  And of course, you know, the only thing worse is a returning veteran or a libertarian or constitutionalist.
[00:08:50.063 --> 00:08:55.707]  Or, in Colorado, they're openly, you know, the state police have admitted, the feds are asking him, are you prepared to confiscate Christians' guns?
[00:08:55.767 --> 00:08:56.848]  That was in the Denver Post.
[00:08:57.888 --> 00:09:05.513]  Even Fox News reports that, oh, they now list evangelicals and Catholics next to Al-Qaeda in the Army training manuals.
[00:09:05.613 --> 00:09:11.096]  So, I guess they're also bad-mouthed towards Washington, so you're in good company.
[00:09:11.396 --> 00:09:12.517]  That's not satire, folks.
[00:09:13.317 --> 00:09:19.901]  We just had legendary satirist Mike Judge of King of the Hill and so much more in that big exclusive interview, but this is not satire.
[00:09:21.101 --> 00:09:23.542]  And by the way, we're carrying both of his powerful books.
[00:09:24.363 --> 00:09:27.324]  These really could change the face of this country, which is starting to happen.
[00:09:28.045 --> 00:09:29.865]  Romans 13, the true meaning of submission.
[00:09:29.885 --> 00:09:34.268]  This was Hitler's favorite verse to say, you know, render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's.
[00:09:34.288 --> 00:09:37.509]  Do what the government says, when it's actually the opposite of what the Bible says.
[00:09:37.569 --> 00:09:40.551]  It's full of, it's got to be 50 or something Bible verses in here.
[00:09:41.271 --> 00:09:54.264]  Great book, history, but the new one is to keep, or not to keep, why Christians should not give up their guns by Timothy Baldwin, who is a constitutional lawyer, and of course his dad, Pastor Charles O. Chuck Baldwin.
[00:09:54.805 --> 00:09:57.528]  And he's on with us right now for the rest of the hour.
[00:09:57.868 --> 00:10:00.431]  He's going to be on on whatever he wants to cover on the nightly news tonight.
[00:10:00.711 --> 00:10:03.934]  The real reason he's here is to be interviewed for Obama Deception 2.
[00:10:05.075 --> 00:10:06.638]  And of course he was kind enough to come here.
[00:10:06.718 --> 00:10:09.402]  I guess it didn't get relayed, but I said set him up for a bomb deception too.
[00:10:09.723 --> 00:10:10.484]  That was why he was here.
[00:10:10.524 --> 00:10:12.427]  But now he knows that's why he's here.
[00:10:13.529 --> 00:10:14.350]  So much going on.
[00:10:14.791 --> 00:10:16.854]  A lot of stuff goes into making the sausage around here, folks.
[00:10:16.874 --> 00:10:18.096]  You don't want to see it happen.
[00:10:19.255 --> 00:10:27.940]  But before we get into all of this, and both these books are available at Infowarsstore.com, and purchasing there also supports the work we're doing in this whole operation we've built.
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:32.362]  Before we get into them coming out and saying, yeah, we'll kill U.S.
[00:10:32.402 --> 00:10:34.263]  citizens with drones, no judge, no jury.
[00:10:34.903 --> 00:10:40.406]  And now they executed one of the Patsy's who supposedly knew the Patsy bombers at the Boston thing.
[00:10:40.566 --> 00:10:42.127]  They said, we don't know how, why, really.
[00:10:42.227 --> 00:10:43.408]  We just shot him in the head at his house.
[00:10:44.408 --> 00:10:47.390]  Uh, and I'm afraid they'll come shoot me in the head and say I resisted or something.
[00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:50.952]  I mean, this is what, you know, authoritarian systems tend to do.
[00:10:51.012 --> 00:10:53.553]  We've got, uh, really a clash happening.
[00:10:53.573 --> 00:10:54.814]  An awakening is happening.
[00:10:55.734 --> 00:10:59.296]  How big, you know, is questionable, but it appears to be giant from what I've seen.
[00:10:59.596 --> 00:11:03.158]  But while the evil is also on the offense, I wanted to ask Chuck Baldwin.
[00:11:04.822 --> 00:11:13.329]  Pastor Chuck Baldwin, his take on the state of the world in general and this tectonic historic battle that's taking place.
[00:11:13.349 --> 00:11:15.450]  But first off, great to have you here, my friend.
[00:11:15.831 --> 00:11:19.453]  What do you think of the studios now that you've had a tour?
[00:11:20.294 --> 00:11:20.915]  Fantastic!
[00:11:21.075 --> 00:11:21.475]  It's great!
[00:11:22.816 --> 00:11:23.877]  It's great to meet the staff.
[00:11:24.117 --> 00:11:25.878]  You've got some wonderful people working around you.
[00:11:26.659 --> 00:11:27.900]  You've got some great facilities.
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.201]  You're building a brand new studio.
[00:11:30.181 --> 00:11:30.762]  It's awesome.
[00:11:30.922 --> 00:11:36.186]  I mean, what people see on the camera is just a small portion of what it takes to run this show.
[00:11:36.246 --> 00:11:37.847]  And Alex, you ought to be commended.
[00:11:37.867 --> 00:11:38.788]  You're doing a great job.
[00:11:38.808 --> 00:11:41.229]  You've got millions of people out there that love you and praying for you.
[00:11:41.269 --> 00:11:47.734]  Well, I mean, I just wanted to, because so many people obviously want to come see the office, but then we'd have fans outside the door, so it's kind of a private facility.
[00:11:47.754 --> 00:11:49.956]  It's just that we are trying to go to the next level.
[00:11:50.936 --> 00:11:55.740]  And so I appreciate your good report, like you said in your sermon you gave.
[00:11:56.661 --> 00:11:57.681]  He has given a good report.
[00:11:58.262 --> 00:12:00.423]  Okay, where would you like to begin here today?
[00:12:00.463 --> 00:12:01.444]  I've thrown out a lot of stuff.
[00:12:01.944 --> 00:12:03.525]  I'll tell you what, I'd like to begin with the book.
[00:12:04.606 --> 00:12:10.731]  Because I really believe that this book, To Keep or Not to Keep, Why Christians Should Not Give Up Their Guns,
[00:12:11.311 --> 00:12:16.734]  Could revolutionize the churches of America and literally could change the course of the country.
[00:12:17.175 --> 00:12:34.045]  You know, when we went through this last debacle with Feinstein and Obama trying to cram this gun control legislation down our throats, it would have happened except for millions of people, freedom-loving, God-fearing people rose up and said, no, you're not taking my semi-automatic rifles.
[00:12:34.105 --> 00:12:36.186]  We are not going to tolerate any more gun control.
[00:12:36.727 --> 00:12:38.308]  And they rose up with such a voice.
[00:12:38.948 --> 00:12:40.689]  That it didn't even pass the U.S.
[00:12:40.709 --> 00:12:42.289]  Senate, Democrat-controlled U.S.
[00:12:42.309 --> 00:12:42.589]  Senate.
[00:12:43.129 --> 00:12:45.270]  So we want a temporary victory.
[00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:51.792]  But the thing that we noticed, Alex, was that the pastors of the churches were absolutely silent.
[00:12:52.332 --> 00:12:54.933]  They were not even engaged whatsoever.
[00:12:55.153 --> 00:12:56.213]  They took no stand.
[00:12:56.693 --> 00:12:59.294]  In fact, some of them just said, well, we should do whatever the government says.
[00:13:00.074 --> 00:13:06.897]  And so we recognize, that is we, my son Tim and I, that there wasn't anything out there in book form addressing this subject.
[00:13:07.337 --> 00:13:11.919]  And so we set out to do that, and we really put our hearts and our minds in this.
[00:13:12.359 --> 00:13:16.461]  We put together, we've got hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of Bible verses.
[00:13:16.481 --> 00:13:22.224]  You know, there's been a lot of books written on the Second Amendment from a constitutional point of view, or historical point of view.
[00:13:22.984 --> 00:13:26.107]  Alex, there's not a book out there anywhere that... No, I know.
[00:13:26.127 --> 00:13:27.548]  The book came in a couple weeks ago.
[00:13:27.568 --> 00:13:28.869]  I could not put it down.
[00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:37.616]  And the issue is, even if you're not a Christian out there or religious folks, they have captured, through the World Council of Churches and ecumenicalism and all of it, the churches.
[00:13:38.537 --> 00:13:42.520]  Major Methodist churches are taking the crosses out from San Francisco to Austin, Texas.
[00:13:43.781 --> 00:13:47.203]  They're sending in change agents who are really globalist operatives.
[00:13:47.743 --> 00:13:50.605]  The Southern Baptist Convention is saying, OK, there's no Second Amendment.
[00:13:51.226 --> 00:13:54.268]  Major Catholic publications are coming out saying, time to repeal.
[00:13:54.508 --> 00:13:55.629]  That's the headline, Second Amendment.
[00:13:56.249 --> 00:13:59.832]  Explain how the country was founded, Pastor, as also a historian.
[00:14:00.732 --> 00:14:02.993]  And versus what they've done now.
[00:14:03.013 --> 00:14:06.095]  I mean, the globalists knew they had to get the churches.
[00:14:06.655 --> 00:14:13.818]  And folks, you need to know that if you're in one of these 501c3s worshiping the government, you might as well move to North Korea and worship Kim Jong-un.
[00:14:14.259 --> 00:14:18.461]  Yeah, the history of our country is really the history of the church.
[00:14:19.602 --> 00:14:21.785]  There would have been no Bunker Hill.
[00:14:21.805 --> 00:14:23.226]  There would have been no Lexington Green.
[00:14:23.246 --> 00:14:24.628]  There would have been no Concord Bridge.
[00:14:25.209 --> 00:14:26.611]  No Declaration of Independence.
[00:14:26.991 --> 00:14:35.983]  There would have been no United States of America had it not been for the pastors of colonial America that the British Crown called the Black Regiment.
[00:14:36.644 --> 00:14:39.927]  They called them that because of the long black robes they wore in the pulpit.
[00:14:40.327 --> 00:14:53.437]  But these were men like Jonas Clark, pastor of the Church of Lexington, for example, that taught their congregants what the biblical principles were relative to freedom and liberty, the second amendment, the preservation of life, the protection of life, etc.
[00:14:53.857 --> 00:14:59.121]  So when the British troops ascended upon Lexington... Talk to those folks out there!
[00:14:59.141 --> 00:14:59.861]  Talk to the preachers!
[00:15:00.522 --> 00:15:00.962]  There they are!
[00:15:00.982 --> 00:15:02.343]  I'm pointing at the camera.
[00:15:02.643 --> 00:15:02.884]  Tell them!
[00:15:04.486 --> 00:15:23.035]  When they ascended on Lexington in April 19, 1775, it was the Minutemen of that time, that they called in history now, were really nothing more than the congregation of the Church of Lexington, pastored by Jonas Clark.
[00:15:23.775 --> 00:15:24.816]  These men had been taught
[00:15:25.316 --> 00:15:28.799]  The principles of liberty, of freedom, of self-defense, etc.
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:31.182]  They knew where the line was drawn.
[00:15:31.242 --> 00:15:35.546]  They knew that we only have one sovereign, and that's not government, it's God.
[00:15:35.766 --> 00:15:37.067]  It's the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:15:37.488 --> 00:15:40.271]  And that any authority, human authority,
[00:15:40.791 --> 00:15:48.996]  that tramples the rights of others that abridges the parameters and jurisdiction that God has granted to it in Scripture.
[00:15:49.296 --> 00:15:58.081]  They become tyrannical and they must be resisted because there's only one King and that's not King George or it's not the President, it's the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:15:58.141 --> 00:16:03.223]  So the congregants at the Church of Lexington understood this and when the British troops came, 800 of them,
[00:16:04.404 --> 00:16:17.227]  There was about 70-75 men from the Church of Lexington that stood on Lexington Green, right outside the church, where they worshipped every Sunday, with their muskets in hand, and they formed a line of defense.
[00:16:17.627 --> 00:16:21.108]  The British saw them, opened fire, eight men were immediately killed.
[00:16:21.608 --> 00:16:27.210]  They returned fire in self-defense, and that was the shot fired heard around the world, and the war for independence began.
[00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:34.574]  They went to Concord, they amassed a defense at the bridge, they drove off the British, and everything became history at that point.
[00:16:34.594 --> 00:16:40.618]  The point is, that never would have happened had it not been for the pastors of colonial America.
[00:16:40.858 --> 00:16:46.181]  And that's the difference that Tim and I saw, Alex, whenever we were looking at this latest gun grab attempt.
[00:16:47.001 --> 00:16:49.322]  Oh, I've been to 20 churches in town or more.
[00:16:50.042 --> 00:16:53.223]  I don't care, Baptist, whatever it is, it's a bunch of government worship.
[00:16:53.863 --> 00:16:58.884]  And what did you think when Billy Graham's organization and his son came out against the Second Amendment?
[00:16:58.964 --> 00:17:00.284]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[00:17:00.324 --> 00:17:15.468]  Well, yeah, well, you know what I thought, because you read my column, but yeah, Franklin Graham, you know, and Richard Lamb, of course, you need to understand that Richard Lamb from the Southern Baptist Convention is a member of the CFR, probably most of your audience, a very enlightened audience.
[00:17:16.508 --> 00:17:18.030]  Sworn to destroy the United States.
[00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:19.972]  He's a member of that, so that didn't surprise me.
[00:17:20.012 --> 00:17:25.699]  But I really was disappointed when Franklin Graham came out and endorsed portions of the Obama gun grab.
[00:17:26.219 --> 00:17:27.941]  I think it shows a couple things.
[00:17:28.061 --> 00:17:32.607]  I think it shows how thirsty these guys are to receive the approbation of government.
[00:17:33.147 --> 00:17:35.228]  That's like the kiss of death.
[00:17:35.688 --> 00:17:38.188]  Whenever the media attacks me, I go, more, more!
[00:17:39.249 --> 00:17:39.769]  They don't get it.
[00:17:39.789 --> 00:17:40.489]  They're out of bullets.
[00:17:41.049 --> 00:17:42.530]  I realize that, but let me tell you what.
[00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:44.110]  I came out of the religious right, Alex.
[00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:45.951]  I was with the moral majority back in the 80s.
[00:17:46.311 --> 00:17:47.831]  Jerry Falwell was my mentor.
[00:17:48.211 --> 00:17:49.732]  I traveled with him on his personal jet.
[00:17:49.772 --> 00:17:51.552]  I've been to all the big conferences, as you said.
[00:17:51.592 --> 00:17:53.113]  I've met these guys.
[00:17:53.173 --> 00:17:54.133]  I've talked with these guys.
[00:17:54.293 --> 00:17:55.013]  I know what's going on.
[00:17:55.673 --> 00:18:01.575]  There is a desire among so many of them to be accepted by the power elite.
[00:18:01.715 --> 00:18:03.040]  No, it's like status.
[00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:04.165]  People get off.
[00:18:05.377 --> 00:18:09.559]  On it, like it fulfills them, like they're not fulfilled while they're hanging around with some billionaire.
[00:18:09.579 --> 00:18:11.541]  Well, there's a lot of perks that go along with it, too.
[00:18:11.641 --> 00:18:15.623]  It's not, you know, when you sit at the king's table, there are perks.
[00:18:16.243 --> 00:18:17.624]  And they want those perks.
[00:18:18.304 --> 00:18:22.386]  But regardless of that, I think there's another, with Franklin, I think it was also maybe a little bit of ignorance.
[00:18:22.767 --> 00:18:23.127]  I don't know.
[00:18:23.547 --> 00:18:26.288]  Some of these guys, I think, are disconnected from reality.
[00:18:26.749 --> 00:18:29.250]  First of all, most of them have never studied the Constitution.
[00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:32.712]  I'm telling you, most of them have never studied the Constitution.
[00:18:33.132 --> 00:18:34.893]  They've never read our history.
[00:18:35.274 --> 00:18:38.176]  They have a very myopic view of Christianity.
[00:18:38.236 --> 00:18:42.600]  They've been taught in a paradigm that's very limited in scope.
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:50.886]  And I think that a lot of that lack of education and information, it comes out whenever they start supporting some of these things, and they really don't know what they're supporting.
[00:18:51.547 --> 00:19:00.134]  So whether it's one or the other, the fact is, and I took Franklin to task on this publicly several times, that we cannot allow these
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:08.224]  Christian leaders who do not know the Constitution to form the opinion of the churches and Christians in America.
[00:19:08.524 --> 00:19:09.685]  And that's why we wrote this book.
[00:19:09.705 --> 00:19:10.746]  It's the Bible that does it.
[00:19:10.766 --> 00:19:11.386]  That's exactly right.
[00:19:11.406 --> 00:19:14.608]  If you want to start a new religion called government worship, go do it.
[00:19:14.648 --> 00:19:17.210]  Write your new book and try to get your converts.
[00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:20.252]  But don't say the Bible says we're supposed to worship government.
[00:19:20.472 --> 00:19:24.554]  I mean, according to this Romans 13 interpretation, Germans should have submitted to Hitler.
[00:19:24.574 --> 00:19:25.335]  And I guess they did.
[00:19:25.355 --> 00:19:25.955]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:19:26.015 --> 00:19:26.816]  And 20 million of them died.
[00:19:27.116 --> 00:19:27.536]  Exactly.
[00:19:27.676 --> 00:19:29.958]  And according to the modern interpretation,
[00:19:30.898 --> 00:19:35.440]  The subject at hand is Christians have no right to defend their Second Amendment rights.
[00:19:35.741 --> 00:19:38.822]  They should turn over their weapons should the government require them to do so.
[00:19:38.942 --> 00:19:41.203]  And stand around while somebody saws a guy's head off.
[00:19:41.563 --> 00:19:44.625]  The video in England of these guys killing this guy.
[00:19:44.825 --> 00:19:47.306]  And everybody just stands around, even talks to him.
[00:19:47.786 --> 00:19:50.828]  And everybody's so liberal, they're kind of like, yeah, maybe murdering him is good.
[00:19:50.848 --> 00:19:52.289]  I mean, he was white.
[00:19:53.109 --> 00:19:55.450]  And so, I mean, the answer is set up a wood chipper.
[00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:56.691]  All white people are fed into it.
[00:19:57.051 --> 00:19:58.412]  Ladies and gentlemen, we'll be right back.
[00:19:58.432 --> 00:19:58.872]  Stay with us.
[00:20:01.732 --> 00:20:02.072]  Whew!
[00:20:02.312 --> 00:20:03.032]  Nice shootin'!
[00:20:03.213 --> 00:20:05.873]  Hey, that's a sweet AK-47 chest rig.

[00:20:39.568 --> 00:20:40.289]  This capitalism?
[00:20:40.349 --> 00:20:46.493]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:20:46.633 --> 00:20:47.393]  Hi, Ted Anderson.

[00:22:59.986 --> 00:23:08.033]  Hi, my name is Annette and due to menopause symptoms for nearly two years, I suffered severe hot flashes which prevented me from sleeping all night.
[00:23:08.333 --> 00:23:12.617]  It was so hard to work because I continued all day to have the hot flashes from hell.
[00:23:12.857 --> 00:23:14.939]  I was exhausted and depleted.
[00:23:15.279 --> 00:23:20.163]  After only three weeks on One World Way, I have no hot flashes and I'm sleeping normally again.
[00:23:20.183 --> 00:23:22.405]  I feel energized and strong.
[00:23:22.825 --> 00:23:23.086]  I think?
[00:23:42.466 --> 00:23:44.848]  Then as a result, your glands and organs work better.
[00:23:45.169 --> 00:23:47.751]  Imagine the quality of life improvement you might have.
[00:23:47.891 --> 00:23:49.453]  To order One World Whey, call 888-988-3325.

[00:24:26.147 --> 00:24:27.128]  Chuck Baldwin's our guest.
[00:24:27.148 --> 00:24:29.149]  This is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:34.853]  Chuck, I was talking to you during the break, and you're the same way.
[00:24:34.873 --> 00:24:48.343]  You want to work all the time fighting this because being oppressed, having tyranny come in and taking over your life is so fundamentally upsetting.
[00:24:49.773 --> 00:24:52.195]  And then you see other people just happy to sell out to it.
[00:24:53.076 --> 00:24:54.977]  And I think that's a spirit that's in people.
[00:24:55.478 --> 00:24:56.358]  But continuing...
[00:24:57.307 --> 00:25:10.398]  Getting into the book meant to be given to preachers that goes over the hundreds of Bible verses about being armed, what does the Bible say about self-defense versus what these government-run churches say?
[00:25:11.199 --> 00:25:14.942]  Yeah, and not just the pastors, but also the Christians that are in the pews.
[00:25:15.022 --> 00:25:17.144]  They need to be enlightened every bit as much.
[00:25:17.684 --> 00:25:19.145]  Yeah, the very first
[00:25:20.006 --> 00:25:22.848]  Chapter of the Bible, and we're going to get into the work of creation.
[00:25:23.689 --> 00:25:26.711]  God gave man two basic commands.
[00:25:26.751 --> 00:25:30.574]  He told him, first of all, be fruitful, multiply, replenish the earth.
[00:25:30.794 --> 00:25:32.535]  That's the command of procreation.
[00:25:33.236 --> 00:25:38.840]  And then right after that, he said, if any man shed man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed.
[00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:42.863]  So right away you have the duty and responsibility to provide life.
[00:25:43.063 --> 00:25:45.625]  And then secondly, to protect life.
[00:25:46.525 --> 00:25:52.488]  The protection of life is just as important as the ability to provide life.
[00:25:52.989 --> 00:25:57.111]  So God gave to both of those responsibilities to man.
[00:25:57.911 --> 00:26:05.896]  It is ludicrous that God would say to the human family to procreate, have children, have a family, have a home,
[00:26:06.596 --> 00:26:12.099]  And then not give them the responsibility and the duty to protect and provide for that family.
[00:26:12.439 --> 00:26:17.502]  In the New Testament, the Scripture says if a man provide not for his own, he is worse than an infidel.
[00:26:17.923 --> 00:26:19.003]  He's denied the faith.
[00:26:19.583 --> 00:26:19.844]  Okay?
[00:26:20.164 --> 00:26:27.168]  So provision, of course, going to work, having a job, making an income, providing food and clothing and nourishment.
[00:26:27.668 --> 00:26:34.616]  Look at England where a guy's getting his head sawed off for like 15 minutes and 30 people stand around taking photos not even having empathy but
[00:26:44.918 --> 00:26:48.320]  The basics of civilization is defending your family.
[00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:55.363]  The whole Bible is examples of people defending themselves, and God's saying, who will stand up for me against the wicked ones?
[00:26:55.803 --> 00:27:08.129]  If you were to take out the stories of the Bible, where you find an example of one of God's men resisting evil authority, and sometimes with arms, I mean, look, Jephthah, Samson,
[00:27:09.289 --> 00:27:09.709]  Gideon.
[00:27:10.109 --> 00:27:11.010]  Take all the judges.
[00:27:11.170 --> 00:27:12.030]  Look at the life.
[00:27:12.190 --> 00:27:12.871]  Look at Abram.
[00:27:13.211 --> 00:27:14.371]  Abram went... Look at David.
[00:27:14.431 --> 00:27:15.752]  The Philistines said that was their land.
[00:27:15.772 --> 00:27:16.552]  He should have knelt to them.
[00:27:17.312 --> 00:27:17.552]  Yes.
[00:27:17.632 --> 00:27:19.233]  Jesus should have done what they said.
[00:27:20.033 --> 00:27:25.036]  In the Garden of Eden, for example, the verse that they often use when Jesus told Simon Peter to put up his sword.
[00:27:25.476 --> 00:27:27.036]  They that live by the sword die by the sword.
[00:27:27.056 --> 00:27:30.718]  That's the verse that they always... By the way, all these verses are covered in this book.
[00:27:30.778 --> 00:27:32.859]  We go... All the verses that they use
[00:27:33.519 --> 00:27:38.741]  To justify passing... It'll always say right before or right after what it actually means.
[00:27:38.841 --> 00:27:39.801]  So we use all that.
[00:27:39.841 --> 00:27:48.205]  For example, Jesus said right before that passage, He told the disciples that they didn't have a sword to sell their clothes and go buy one.
[00:27:48.225 --> 00:27:49.145]  Okay?
[00:27:49.725 --> 00:27:53.346]  Jesus commanded them to buy a sword, a Roman sword.
[00:27:53.687 --> 00:28:02.910]  Now understand too, Alex, that the Roman sword was a military instrument that the Jewish people were not allowed to carry under Roman law.
[00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:04.171]  He was saying get illegal weapons.
[00:28:04.191 --> 00:28:07.795]  He was saying get an illegal weapon, a military-style weapon.
[00:28:07.815 --> 00:28:10.298]  The best, most deadliest short sword out there.
[00:28:10.318 --> 00:28:10.699]  That's right.
[00:28:10.719 --> 00:28:14.162]  The most effective, efficient self-defense tool in the world at that time.
[00:28:14.683 --> 00:28:19.608]  And he actually told him, commanded him to go buy one, even though the Roman law said you couldn't have one.
[00:28:20.049 --> 00:28:21.971]  So this should... But that's just Jesus!
[00:28:23.332 --> 00:28:24.273]  That's a son of God!
[00:28:24.293 --> 00:28:28.214]  You know, we're talking about a complete misunderstanding.
[00:28:28.234 --> 00:28:33.276]  When Jesus told Simon Peter to put up his sword, notice he did not tell him to give up his sword.
[00:28:33.996 --> 00:28:35.537]  Again, an illegal weapon.
[00:28:35.817 --> 00:28:37.058]  He's already carrying it with him.
[00:28:37.078 --> 00:28:39.619]  There were two swords among the eleven apostles.
[00:28:39.999 --> 00:28:44.081]  No, it was time for Christ to make the sacrifice, so that wasn't the time to fight.
[00:28:44.101 --> 00:28:44.721]  Exactly right.
[00:28:44.781 --> 00:28:45.881]  It wasn't the time to fight.
[00:28:46.282 --> 00:28:49.483]  Jesus came to die to give his life a ransom for the sins of mankind.
[00:28:50.023 --> 00:28:51.064]  He made that very clear.
[00:28:51.084 --> 00:28:52.585]  The disciples didn't understand that.
[00:28:53.045 --> 00:28:53.746]  Jesus did.
[00:28:54.086 --> 00:28:56.168]  He was telling Simon, put up your sword.
[00:28:56.288 --> 00:28:57.629]  It's not time to use it.
[00:28:57.789 --> 00:28:58.890]  I have come to give my life.
[00:28:59.150 --> 00:29:00.191]  I've come to be arrested.
[00:29:00.471 --> 00:29:02.152]  I've come to be crucified.
[00:29:02.532 --> 00:29:04.614]  That's why he was just crying in the garden.
[00:29:04.734 --> 00:29:10.418]  But notice that he also, Alex, whenever the soldiers came, why didn't they arrest Simon Peter when he cut off the ear?
[00:29:10.438 --> 00:29:12.240]  I mean, that would have been attempted murder.
[00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:15.582]  If you were going to make a legal charge out of that, that would have been attempted murder.
[00:29:15.602 --> 00:29:17.584]  Christ wanted them to go on and be witnesses.
[00:29:17.944 --> 00:29:19.745]  Right, but why didn't they arrest Simon?
[00:29:19.785 --> 00:29:21.146]  Why didn't they arrest the disciples?
[00:29:21.186 --> 00:29:22.166]  Why didn't they disarm him?
[00:29:22.466 --> 00:29:25.148]  Why did Simon Peter leave with his sword?
[00:29:25.268 --> 00:29:31.171]  Because Christ did the miracle and... Because Christ had knocked the soldiers on their can with the power of his voice.
[00:29:31.491 --> 00:29:35.453]  And he protected the disciples and their ability to keep their arms.
[00:29:35.973 --> 00:29:37.314]  So, the witnesses could be there.
[00:29:38.054 --> 00:29:38.454]  Exactly.
[00:29:39.095 --> 00:29:39.555]  Absolutely.
[00:29:39.575 --> 00:29:40.155]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:40.175 --> 00:29:42.616]  And most people read the Bible, they don't get how deep it is.
[00:29:42.636 --> 00:29:45.058]  I mean, there's no literature like it, because it's not literature.
[00:29:45.078 --> 00:29:46.959]  We'll be right back with Pastor Chuck Baldwin.
[00:29:46.979 --> 00:29:47.359]  Stay with us.
[00:29:49.639 --> 00:29:52.622]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.

[00:32:00.811 --> 00:32:01.832]  I had tried everything.
[00:32:01.892 --> 00:32:06.955]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating, I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[00:32:07.375 --> 00:32:11.858]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[00:32:12.198 --> 00:32:18.582]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.

[00:34:25.285 --> 00:34:28.728]  We have only done this one other time and Pro-Pure sold out.
[00:34:28.768 --> 00:34:29.628]  We're their biggest dealer.
[00:34:30.189 --> 00:34:31.650]  Sold out in a couple weeks.
[00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:32.731]  So we're only running this for a week.

[00:35:24.008 --> 00:35:25.789]  It's $14.95, folks.
[00:35:26.069 --> 00:35:29.351]  Okay, that is very close to cost for what we bought at wholesale.
[00:35:30.252 --> 00:35:36.976]  You need to get this book to every pastor you know, and every youth pastor, and everybody going to seminary.
[00:35:37.396 --> 00:35:41.999]  I don't care whether they're Catholic, Protestant, Mormon, Easter Bunnies, whatever they are.
[00:35:43.132 --> 00:35:48.217]  This is the Bible, and 70-something percent, some numbers say 80 percent identify as Christian.
[00:35:48.237 --> 00:35:50.360]  I can get Pastor Baldwin to give me his numbers.
[00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:51.541]  They claim to be Christian.
[00:35:51.621 --> 00:35:52.842]  I'm not up here on some high horse.
[00:35:53.543 --> 00:35:58.388]  I just know that they have taken over our big churches, and they, I mean, I go to them.
[00:35:59.008 --> 00:36:00.670]  My wife still goes to big churches in town.
[00:36:01.051 --> 00:36:04.134]  And the overall will be good stuff, but it's still a bunch of government worship at the end of it.
[00:36:05.325 --> 00:36:09.926]  And their argument is, well, we're going to save souls, and if everything goes to hell, at least we'll have the souls saved.
[00:36:10.166 --> 00:36:13.167]  People are going to be deceived by all this evil if they don't know the big picture.
[00:36:13.768 --> 00:36:16.468]  This government is pure evil at the top.
[00:36:17.109 --> 00:36:20.389]  They're aborting babies, you know, after they're born.
[00:36:20.409 --> 00:36:21.890]  They're wanting to kill them up to age three now.
[00:36:23.612 --> 00:36:25.954]  The Journal of Pediatrics publishes papers on that.
[00:36:26.455 --> 00:36:27.475]  These are not liberals.
[00:36:28.196 --> 00:36:33.381]  And the so-called conservatives are just the placeholders for them, so we think we have an opposition to all of this.
[00:36:33.801 --> 00:36:37.364]  And I like Senator Cruz coming out and saying our big problem is the Republican Party.
[00:36:37.765 --> 00:36:38.846]  We can beat the Democrats.
[00:36:39.286 --> 00:36:46.452]  Our big problem is the establishment, people like Senator Graham and others, Lindsey Graham.
[00:36:46.873 --> 00:36:48.835]  Our problem are people like Franklin Graham.
[00:36:49.673 --> 00:36:51.094]  I mean, it is incredible!
[00:36:51.375 --> 00:36:54.718]  All the government arms to the teeth and does all this, saying we shouldn't be armed.
[00:36:54.738 --> 00:36:59.142]  So this book, To Keep or Not to Keep, Why Christians Should Not Give Up Their Guns.
[00:36:59.282 --> 00:37:00.543]  I mean, unbelievable!
[00:37:01.524 --> 00:37:04.347]  I mean, why do we supposedly have a military to fight other evil governments?
[00:37:04.647 --> 00:37:07.670]  Well, if governments are all ordained by God, then how is that the case?
[00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:12.855]  No, if you become evil, God will turn your society over and let the evil take over.
[00:37:13.075 --> 00:37:14.796]  Am I correct in saying that, Pastor Baldwin?
[00:37:14.816 --> 00:37:15.976]  You're exactly correct, Alex.
[00:37:16.617 --> 00:37:36.746]  And let's not forget that the very fact that you have a military or police that most Christians and most conservatives would recognize the right to enforce the law and to defend the community or the nation, as the case may be, that all of that derives its legitimacy from we the people, okay?
[00:37:37.766 --> 00:37:50.234]  They have the right to defend the country and to defend the community with force because we as individuals created in the image of God have the right to protect our lives.
[00:37:50.254 --> 00:37:58.319]  We created a government duly constituted amongst men to secure our liberties and they are our servants that we have created a professional force.
[00:37:58.759 --> 00:38:01.441]  But now that professional force has not become our king.
[00:38:01.841 --> 00:38:14.365]  The point though is that Christians need to realize that if they really believe that the military and police have the right to bear arms and to protect society and protect the nation, they only have that right because they got it from us.
[00:38:14.945 --> 00:38:17.266]  It is an individual God-given right first.
[00:38:17.286 --> 00:38:18.146]  Yeah, we got it from God.
[00:38:18.426 --> 00:38:24.692]  And it became a collective right as we the people ceded to them that authority.
[00:38:24.952 --> 00:38:28.075]  But it stems and grows from we the people.
[00:38:28.395 --> 00:38:30.817]  It's an individual right given to us by God.
[00:38:31.738 --> 00:38:34.080]  If we don't have a right to defend ourselves individually,
[00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:37.801]  Then the military does not have a right to defend the country collectively.
[00:38:38.142 --> 00:38:41.763]  Or the police does not have the right to defend the community collectively.
[00:38:42.063 --> 00:38:47.345]  They only have that right collectively because we have the right individually as it was given to us by God.
[00:38:47.585 --> 00:38:50.647]  And that's a disconnect that Christians just don't seem to understand.
[00:38:50.707 --> 00:39:00.191]  Well, you're empowering evil when you say good people can't have weapons because they will follow that law and you've just empowered evil.
[00:39:00.891 --> 00:39:10.979]  Well, not only that, I think it shows utter ignorance on behalf of the pastors and the Christians of the country who haven't studied the principles of natural law as given to us by God.
[00:39:11.779 --> 00:39:12.900]  The seminaries haven't taught it.
[00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:15.322]  The Bible... I mean, look, I've been through all that.
[00:39:15.722 --> 00:39:16.803]  You know, I grew up in that.
[00:39:17.864 --> 00:39:18.744]  How did you wake up then?
[00:39:18.764 --> 00:39:19.165]  When was that?
[00:39:20.117 --> 00:39:21.778]  You know, it's a long process.
[00:39:21.838 --> 00:39:28.884]  I mean, we all mature at different rates and different levels, but I guess it was probably 1994 when Clinton first got elected.
[00:39:29.524 --> 00:39:30.665]  I started my radio show.
[00:39:30.745 --> 00:39:31.586]  He was elected in 92.
[00:39:31.666 --> 00:39:32.947]  I started my show in 94.
[00:39:33.567 --> 00:39:37.190]  I started scouring the news and started, you know, getting involved.
[00:39:37.210 --> 00:39:44.476]  I started listening to you, and I started hearing a lot of the other things that were going on in the country, doing my own research, doing my own study, because you don't learn this in school.
[00:39:44.836 --> 00:39:46.738]  I had to go into the Bible, search it for myself.
[00:39:46.758 --> 00:39:48.019]  I had to do a lot of self-study.
[00:39:48.559 --> 00:39:52.101]  And as I began to grow and I began to learn, I realized how much I didn't know.
[00:39:52.641 --> 00:39:58.404]  And I began to develop an appreciation for where we are as a people in terms of where we were in our history.
[00:39:58.424 --> 00:39:59.845]  Well, it's certainly advanced now.
[00:39:59.885 --> 00:40:02.126]  I learned a lot watching your sermons.
[00:40:02.206 --> 00:40:05.467]  And I mean, I sit there, I usually get to watch them when they first happen live.
[00:40:05.507 --> 00:40:07.909]  I watch them a day or two after my wife watches them.
[00:40:08.509 --> 00:40:12.511]  And people go to ChuckBaldwinLive.com, but also find them on YouTube.
[00:40:12.771 --> 00:40:12.951]  Right.
[00:40:13.332 --> 00:40:15.213]  You know, we put all of our sermons up on YouTube now.
[00:40:15.914 --> 00:40:16.895]  Almost the same day.
[00:40:16.995 --> 00:40:22.539]  We have a technical crew that puts them up either on Sunday night or very early on Monday morning.
[00:40:22.559 --> 00:40:24.641]  So usually by Monday morning, they're already up on YouTube.
[00:40:25.141 --> 00:40:28.304]  I want to, you know, tonight, I think I'm going to, because I mean, it's my nature.
[00:40:28.324 --> 00:40:33.328]  I get excited, tummy full, and then I run off, you know, with the mouth with a bunch of points, which is good, but also bad.
[00:40:33.688 --> 00:40:34.029]  I want to
[00:40:38.032 --> 00:40:45.615]  I think what I should do is just introduce you and maybe you can preach a sermon tonight on InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:40:46.016 --> 00:40:46.516]  Want to do that?
[00:40:48.597 --> 00:40:48.917]  Wow!
[00:40:49.277 --> 00:40:50.578]  I'll bring a lectern in there if you want.
[00:40:52.688 --> 00:40:54.569]  Alex, I'm your servant, whatever you want me to do.
[00:40:54.589 --> 00:40:56.750]  I don't want to wear you out, but you said you're here to work.
[00:40:56.810 --> 00:40:57.330]  I'm here to work.
[00:40:57.350 --> 00:41:02.533]  I mean, we're going to do this radio show, we're going to do the interview for Obama Deception, and then you can give an hour-long sermon if you want.
[00:41:02.813 --> 00:41:11.457]  Yeah, whatever you want me to do, but what I want your audience to know is the importance of this book and how it can change the course of the church.
[00:41:11.798 --> 00:41:20.142]  Look, in the first 48 to 72 hours after the book was released, a sizable percentage of the orders that we got, Alex, were from pastors.
[00:41:21.092 --> 00:41:21.873]  That's encouraging.
[00:41:22.413 --> 00:41:23.093]  That's encouraging.
[00:41:23.454 --> 00:41:27.476]  What they're saying is, look, we know in our heart that we have the right to keep and bear arms.
[00:41:27.616 --> 00:41:29.758]  We know in our heart we have the right to defend ourselves.
[00:41:30.078 --> 00:41:35.101]  We know in our heart that it's wrong for the government to tell us to surrender our semi-automatic rifles.
[00:41:35.502 --> 00:41:37.483]  But where in the scripture do we find that?
[00:41:37.843 --> 00:41:38.784]  They've never been taught.
[00:41:39.224 --> 00:41:41.045]  And so that's why this book is so important.
[00:41:41.065 --> 00:41:48.230]  It shows them in the scripture where the Bible gives them the authority under natural law and revealed law.
[00:41:52.013 --> 00:41:55.835]  Well, the preachers that are government control... They're going to say Obama is Jesus, basically.
[00:41:56.075 --> 00:41:57.916]  Those people, I don't know that there's any hope for them.
[00:41:58.236 --> 00:42:01.398]  The only hope for that is, if you're in a church like that, you need to get out.
[00:42:01.478 --> 00:42:05.660]  Well, I'll tell you, we've discovered Bill and Melinda Gates are funding a lot of these churches, and, you know, he's a big...
[00:42:06.921 --> 00:42:09.082]  Collectivists and eugenicists.
[00:42:09.642 --> 00:42:18.005]  And they send in now from the central churches, the Methodists and others, they send in change agents that are not even atheists.
[00:42:18.525 --> 00:42:20.766]  But they're up there running the whole thing.
[00:42:20.786 --> 00:42:25.808]  And I'm sure you know about this phenomenon where they're actually just cold-blooded operatives.
[00:42:26.288 --> 00:42:34.391]  They're incrementally trying to keep the church there to be basically a Soviet army, but by increments they're there basically re-educating people.
[00:42:34.611 --> 00:42:35.672]  Well, even the ones that aren't.
[00:42:35.772 --> 00:42:39.535]  Even your typical 501c... No, but I'm telling you, there are a lot of them that are operatives.
[00:42:39.555 --> 00:42:40.175]  Oh, I believe that.
[00:42:40.416 --> 00:42:42.537]  No, I don't have any doubt about that.
[00:42:42.677 --> 00:42:45.960]  And we all know about the Pastor... What's it called?
[00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:46.761]  Clergy Response Team.
[00:42:46.781 --> 00:42:52.025]  Clergy Response Team, the theme has been doing... I've got a lot of pastors that have given me first-hand testimony about that.
[00:42:52.205 --> 00:42:53.086]  Oh, tell us about that!
[00:42:53.166 --> 00:42:53.846]  Tell us about that, or...
[00:42:54.787 --> 00:42:59.028]  Or don't forget tonight, because we got the documents, and later people didn't believe me, and then it was on the news.
[00:42:59.408 --> 00:43:01.169]  They go, oh, turn your guns in and tell the Lord.
[00:43:01.309 --> 00:43:02.089]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[00:43:02.109 --> 00:43:04.430]  So during an emergency, you turn the guns in.
[00:43:04.590 --> 00:43:05.210]  No, that's written.
[00:43:05.310 --> 00:43:06.771]  I mean, they've got that in their training manual.
[00:43:06.791 --> 00:43:10.052]  No, but I want to hear what the preachers, briefly, the preachers you know, what did they say?
[00:43:10.072 --> 00:43:10.732]  Sure, I'd be glad to.
[00:43:10.952 --> 00:43:11.612]  And that's chilling.
[00:43:11.792 --> 00:43:26.902]  Yeah, but the point is that even the ones that are just your typical 501c3 pastor, they really have been buffaloed into thinking that somehow or another, that because they're 501c3, they can't say this, they can't say that, they can't get involved in politics, they can't take a stand.
[00:43:27.362 --> 00:43:28.703]  It's an intimidation factor.
[00:43:29.223 --> 00:43:33.846]  And as a result, they are afraid to broach... Well, it's political correctness!
[00:43:33.926 --> 00:43:39.890]  I mean, I was at Martin Springs this weekend, and there was a Hispanic guy and two white guys swimming around, and their girlfriends were up on the bank.
[00:43:40.450 --> 00:43:42.452]  And one of them goes, let's get Chinese food when we leave here.
[00:43:43.954 --> 00:43:47.498]  And the two white guys said to the Hispanic, because it's the white guys that are so politically, you know, correct.
[00:43:47.759 --> 00:43:49.681]  They go, don't, you can't say Chinese.
[00:43:49.721 --> 00:43:50.622]  And they weren't joking.
[00:43:51.222 --> 00:43:54.606]  And now people think everything is like racist or something.
[00:43:55.047 --> 00:43:55.888]  And it's the same thing.
[00:43:55.988 --> 00:44:01.014]  Once you get yourself in that box, the box only gets smaller to where you're afraid to talk about anything.
[00:44:01.755 --> 00:44:03.135]  Yeah, and that's where these guys are.
[00:44:03.495 --> 00:44:04.896]  They really are afraid to talk about it.
[00:44:05.236 --> 00:44:06.716]  And a lot of them have never studied it.
[00:44:06.796 --> 00:44:07.736]  They've never been taught it.
[00:44:08.676 --> 00:44:11.477]  They don't know the first thing about the principles of natural law.
[00:44:11.777 --> 00:44:14.157]  They don't know the first thing about the principles of freedom and liberty.
[00:44:14.738 --> 00:44:24.099]  Everything that the Founding Fathers understood from a historical and a spiritual perspective, even the ones that were not Christians, they understood the biblical principles of liberty.
[00:44:24.119 --> 00:44:25.880]  Well, that's why... That's what's missing today.
[00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:26.960]  That's what this book
[00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:29.102]  Helps to resolve.
[00:44:29.522 --> 00:44:35.429]  This book, Alex, I believe if enough Christians and pastors would read it, it would revolutionize the church.
[00:44:35.789 --> 00:44:38.972]  And if it revolutionizes the church, it could change the course of the country.
[00:44:39.013 --> 00:44:46.200]  And that's up to the listeners to get the book at Infowarsstore.com and to go hand deliver it and then a month later say, did you read that?
[00:44:46.661 --> 00:44:48.042]  And if the pastor hasn't done that,
[00:44:48.763 --> 00:44:51.386]  I'm not a big guy into breaking up churches, but these aren't even churches.
[00:44:51.686 --> 00:44:53.088]  How do people make an issue?
[00:44:53.128 --> 00:44:54.029]  Hand out flyers?
[00:44:54.730 --> 00:44:56.171]  Call for a church meeting about it?
[00:44:56.431 --> 00:45:00.656]  I mean, how do you make these churches stop being New World Order mouthpieces?
[00:45:00.676 --> 00:45:02.778]  Well, first of all, if you are a freedom lover...
[00:45:03.624 --> 00:45:08.427]  And you're attending one of these silent, sheepish, 501c3 churches.
[00:45:08.948 --> 00:45:09.348]  Get out.
[00:45:09.728 --> 00:45:10.489]  Vote with your feet.
[00:45:11.029 --> 00:45:13.151]  You know, they continue to give their tithes and offerings.
[00:45:13.171 --> 00:45:16.473]  They continue to support... But do you tell people, also, I'm leaving because of this?
[00:45:16.673 --> 00:45:17.434]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:45:17.794 --> 00:45:18.534]  They need to know.
[00:45:18.935 --> 00:45:20.416]  They need to know that they are not...
[00:45:20.956 --> 00:45:27.458]  Being the shepherd to their flock that God would have them to be, and as a result, the sheep are not going to stay with that shepherd.
[00:45:27.738 --> 00:45:37.041]  They need to understand that as long as they have the crowds, and the money, and the buildings, and the notoriety, what is the motivation they have to make any difference in what they're doing?
[00:45:37.061 --> 00:45:38.201]  They're not going to change anything.
[00:45:38.562 --> 00:45:45.224]  But if enough people out there in the congregation said, look, it's so late in the day, preacher, our country is going to hell in a handbasket.
[00:45:45.264 --> 00:45:46.464]  We're about to lose our freedoms.
[00:45:46.924 --> 00:45:49.245]  Your kids and mine are going to grow up in tyranny
[00:45:49.785 --> 00:46:03.534]  If we, you and me, if we don't do something about it now, and if you're not going to take a stand for my kids and for my grandkids, and for the freedom of this country, according to the scriptures that God has given you as a watchman on the wall, then I'm going to go find a shepherd who will.
[00:46:03.874 --> 00:46:08.958]  And if enough people did that, I think at least the pastors would say, wait a minute, there's something here I'm missing.
[00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:11.400]  It's incredible.
[00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:22.444]  I want you to go over some of the verses that you've got in the book, to keep or not to keep, why Christians should not give up their guns, written with your constitutional lawyer's sign, Timothy Baldwin.
[00:46:22.784 --> 00:46:25.145]  Again, Chuck Baldwin, the pastor, is here with us.
[00:46:25.525 --> 00:46:27.746]  I mean, this is really the fight, folks.
[00:46:27.766 --> 00:46:33.908]  I mean, there's hundreds of them in here, but let's get into some of these scriptures, and then some of the scriptures they use to go after the guns.
[00:46:34.028 --> 00:46:36.349]  Okay, well, let's go to page 72 and 73.
[00:46:37.070 --> 00:46:41.512]  We touched on it just briefly in the last segment, I mean.
[00:46:41.732 --> 00:46:45.074]  If you live by the sword, you'll die by the sword, what Jesus said in the Garden of Eden.
[00:46:45.534 --> 00:46:52.779]  And they take that to mean, well, if you use the sword in any way, then you're wrong, you're sinful, you shouldn't do it.
[00:46:53.499 --> 00:46:58.422]  And that's what Jesus said to Simon Peter in the Garden, when actually the opposite is true.
[00:46:58.982 --> 00:47:00.864]  Well then how do you send the military off with a sword?
[00:47:00.924 --> 00:47:01.964]  It's just totally hypocritical.
[00:47:01.984 --> 00:47:05.587]  What Jesus was saying though, he was saying, if you live by the sword, you die by the sword.
[00:47:05.707 --> 00:47:11.792]  Alex, what he was saying was, the tyrants... They live by the sword offensively!
[00:47:11.832 --> 00:47:12.273]  That's right.
[00:47:12.373 --> 00:47:15.915]  They live by the sword by inflicting harm
[00:47:18.538 --> 00:47:19.819]  And we have the sword for defense!
[00:47:38.433 --> 00:47:38.774]  That's right.
[00:47:38.814 --> 00:47:44.340]  It's not time for you to use the sword now because I came to die and give my life a ransom for the souls of men.
[00:47:44.781 --> 00:47:45.742]  You put up your sword.
[00:47:46.102 --> 00:47:52.891]  But they that live by the sword, these tyrants that enforce their will by the edge of the sword, they are going to die by the sword.
[00:47:52.911 --> 00:47:54.633]  Because next he says, go and buy a Roman sword.
[00:47:54.793 --> 00:47:55.873]  No, he said that before that.
[00:47:55.913 --> 00:47:57.554]  He said before that, go buy a sword.
[00:47:57.834 --> 00:48:00.455]  And there were already two of the disciples that were carrying swords.
[00:48:00.515 --> 00:48:01.495]  Simon Peter was the other one.
[00:48:01.535 --> 00:48:03.456]  I think probably Matthew was the second one.
[00:48:03.976 --> 00:48:05.137]  Jesus told the rest of them.
[00:48:05.157 --> 00:48:07.737]  And by the way, if they caught you with a sword, they would crucify you.
[00:48:07.758 --> 00:48:08.998]  Well, it was against the law.
[00:48:09.038 --> 00:48:10.178]  It was against Roman law.
[00:48:10.418 --> 00:48:14.200]  Oh, so he said break unconstitutional assault weapon bans.
[00:48:14.420 --> 00:48:14.840]  Exactly.
[00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:16.060]  But that's Jesus.
[00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:17.581]  We should listen to the preacher, not him.
[00:48:19.282 --> 00:48:20.223]  Yeah, Jesus did!
[00:48:20.243 --> 00:48:23.466]  I mean, that's something that most pastors just have never thought about.
[00:48:24.567 --> 00:48:35.337]  To your audience out there, ask your pastor, do you realize when Jesus told his disciples to buy a sword, he was talking about the Roman sword, the most efficient, effective self-defense tool
[00:48:35.957 --> 00:48:37.719]  In the world, it was a military-style weapon.
[00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:45.769]  He was telling them to purchase a weapon that the Roman government had forbade the Jewish people from owning and possessing.
[00:48:46.090 --> 00:48:51.216]  He was requiring them that they break human law in order to fill God's law.
[00:48:51.536 --> 00:48:53.997]  Now that is something that most pastors have never even thought about.
[00:48:54.297 --> 00:49:02.239]  And we know it's the same sword because in the Greek language, the same word is used when Jesus said, the sword, as it was in Romans 13.
[00:49:02.599 --> 00:49:06.400]  When he talked about the government, they bear not the sword in vain.
[00:49:06.420 --> 00:49:08.300]  He's talking about the government in Romans 13.
[00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:12.761]  Plus he's saying, render unto Caesar that which is Caesar, whose face is on it?
[00:49:12.821 --> 00:49:14.222]  It's the government's currency.
[00:49:14.502 --> 00:49:16.302]  So of course they control it, he's saying.
[00:49:16.622 --> 00:49:18.843]  It's like, you know, using Federal Reserve notes.
[00:49:19.403 --> 00:49:29.869]  Yeah, my point is that it's the same word, the same word for sword, that he used when he told the disciples to go... Yeah, but Daniel should have done what he was told and not go on a lion's den.
[00:49:30.250 --> 00:49:31.991]  The other people shouldn't have gone in the fiery furnace.
[00:49:32.011 --> 00:49:32.991]  They should have done what they were told.
[00:49:33.351 --> 00:49:38.314]  According to these preachers... Yeah, I mean, take all the... John the Baptist should have done what Herod said.
[00:49:38.675 --> 00:49:44.558]  Take all of the stories out of the Bible where you have an example of one of God's people
[00:49:46.019 --> 00:49:48.240]  Resisting evil authority.
[00:49:48.701 --> 00:49:49.741]  Resisting the law.
[00:49:50.342 --> 00:49:53.243]  And you're going to take out a sizable portion of the Bible.
[00:49:53.483 --> 00:49:59.927]  In fact, in a general way, I would say, find me a major Bible character that did not resist the law.
[00:49:59.987 --> 00:50:04.870]  I think, because I've read the whole Bible, not as much as you, I'd say 70% of the Bible.
[00:50:05.290 --> 00:50:07.932]  I mean, Moses should have done what Pharaoh said.
[00:50:08.312 --> 00:50:08.833]  He resisted.
[00:50:08.873 --> 00:50:09.493]  He was a bad person.
[00:50:11.834 --> 00:50:25.563]  When he, according to Hebrews, he chose to suffer affliction with the people of God rather than enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season, esteeming the riches of Christ, the reproach of Christ, excuse me, greater riches.
[00:50:26.583 --> 00:50:27.344]  When did he do that?
[00:50:27.824 --> 00:50:33.007]  He did that when he killed the Egyptian taskmaster who was murdering the Jewish slave.
[00:50:33.027 --> 00:50:33.868]  He protected someone.
[00:50:33.908 --> 00:50:34.648]  He protected someone.
[00:50:34.668 --> 00:50:37.510]  He should have helped the taskmaster kill the old man.
[00:50:38.090 --> 00:50:47.256]  If the rest of the Hebrews would have understood what Moses was doing, they would have joined him at that point, and they would have saved themselves from 40 years of tyranny.
[00:50:47.556 --> 00:50:52.359]  But because they wouldn't follow Moses then, they had to go through 40 more years of tyranny.
[00:50:53.039 --> 00:50:53.660]  Unbelievable!
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:54.440]  You heard it!
[00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:55.321]  Moses was evil.
[00:50:55.341 --> 00:50:56.521]  He defended an old person.
[00:50:56.541 --> 00:50:58.002]  You're not supposed to do that.
[00:50:58.042 --> 00:50:59.983]  You're supposed to let the government kill them.
[00:51:00.504 --> 00:51:04.586]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.

[00:53:00.649 --> 00:53:06.031]  Imagine waking one morning only to find your family shivering in the dark because you couldn't afford to pay your electric bill.
[00:53:06.651 --> 00:53:07.751]  That's closer than you think.
[00:53:08.472 --> 00:53:14.294]  You probably haven't heard about this yet because the liberal media has been suppressing what has fast become the most shocking news story of 2012.
[00:53:14.654 --> 00:53:22.597]  Obama's secret war on coal that could increase your already high power bill as much as 400% in coming months.
[00:53:23.397 --> 00:53:28.939]  As shocking as it sounds, it may well be just a matter of time before the lights start going out across America.
[00:53:29.679 --> 00:53:30.680]  But here's some good news.
[00:53:31.060 --> 00:53:39.906]  There's an underground video at exposed123.com that thousands of smart patriots have used to end their slavery to the corrupt electricity monopoly.
[00:53:40.547 --> 00:53:49.333]  The video at exposed123.com has already been banned by Google, and the liberal media is doing everything in its power to take it down and keep America in the dark.
[00:53:49.814 --> 00:53:53.857]  So watch it now at exposed123.com before it's too late.
[00:53:54.017 --> 00:53:55.498]  Again, that's exposed123.com.
[00:54:00.356 --> 00:54:00.720]  I think?
[00:54:17.577 --> 00:54:23.646]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have a clip coming up here in a moment.
[00:54:23.706 --> 00:54:25.488]  Do we have that cued up?
[00:54:33.820 --> 00:54:52.754]  Obama just like three minutes ago during the break, this was live, he's up there talking about how great it is to have drones killing US citizens without due process and how liberal that is and how he's gonna get five more peace prizes for it and you know he's got his disinfo trolls out there saying that all sorts of baloney about us and probably a code pink lady the way they sound.
[00:54:54.035 --> 00:54:56.396]  ...gets up there and says, you know, there's people on a hunger strike.
[00:54:56.436 --> 00:54:57.216]  Oh yeah, they're dying.
[00:54:57.516 --> 00:54:59.417]  And it's mainly innocent people at Gitmo.
[00:54:59.897 --> 00:55:00.897]  It's just a torture base.
[00:55:00.957 --> 00:55:05.399]  Meanwhile, the globalists run the real Al-Qaeda on record in Libya and Syria.
[00:55:05.739 --> 00:55:11.181]  And then use the extremists they wind up to, to, as a pretext to take our liberties.
[00:55:12.487 --> 00:55:15.510]  And of course, this is now becoming mainstream news, thank God.
[00:55:15.890 --> 00:55:20.493]  And people are like going, wait a minute, you bring in the radicals, then they kill people, then you take our rights?
[00:55:21.134 --> 00:55:22.695]  And then you're funding their commanders?
[00:55:23.496 --> 00:55:25.577]  Yeah, the people doing it are extremists.
[00:55:26.558 --> 00:55:28.900]  But the point is, is that they're being wound up.
[00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:34.004]  But here is Obama being heckled, and this went on for a while, here it is.
[00:55:34.024 --> 00:55:41.530]  So, let me finish, man.
[00:55:41.550 --> 00:55:41.810]  So, today,
[00:55:43.618 --> 00:55:49.045]  So today, once again, today... I'm about to address it, ma'am, but you gotta let me speak.
[00:55:49.205 --> 00:55:49.886]  I'm about to address it.
[00:55:49.926 --> 00:55:50.407]  Let me address it.
[00:55:50.427 --> 00:55:51.949]  Why don't you let me address it, ma'am?
[00:55:51.969 --> 00:55:56.574]  Why don't you sit down and I will tell you exactly what I'm going to do.
[00:56:03.917 --> 00:56:05.178]  Sit down and I'll lie to you.
[00:56:05.218 --> 00:56:05.819]  Thank you, ma'am.
[00:56:05.859 --> 00:56:07.740]  Thank you.
[00:56:07.780 --> 00:56:08.441]  Thank you.
[00:56:10.002 --> 00:56:11.383]  Said he wouldn't hire a lobbyist.
[00:56:11.743 --> 00:56:12.043]  Thank you.
[00:56:12.684 --> 00:56:13.164]  Did hire him.
[00:56:13.885 --> 00:56:15.166]  You should let me finish my sentence.
[00:56:16.107 --> 00:56:16.827]  Look at that arrogance.
[00:56:16.847 --> 00:56:17.167]  Today.
[00:56:17.968 --> 00:56:18.969]  Said he wouldn't do bailouts, but he did.
[00:56:18.989 --> 00:56:23.492]  I'm asking the whole of Congress to lift the restrictions on detainee transfers from Gitmo.
[00:56:24.693 --> 00:56:25.474]  I have asked
[00:56:29.101 --> 00:56:34.785]  I have asked the Department of Defense to designate a site in the United States where we can hold military commissions.
[00:56:36.078 --> 00:56:39.359]  I'm appointing a new senior envoy at the State Department.
[00:56:39.379 --> 00:56:39.759]  That's enough.
[00:56:39.779 --> 00:56:40.259]  Shut it down.
[00:56:40.279 --> 00:56:42.239]  We're going to go into overdrive and let the pastor finish.
[00:56:42.559 --> 00:56:57.462]  But folks, the reason we played this is they make it act like it's conservative to have people secretly held with no due process and tortured for years, even when it's found they're innocent, and then release the really bad guys to go out from there and commit attacks as their promise of getting out.
[00:56:57.542 --> 00:56:58.163]  That's happened.
[00:56:59.083 --> 00:57:00.223]  That's a mind control base.
[00:57:00.343 --> 00:57:02.684]  On record, the CIA has a mind control facility.
[00:57:02.924 --> 00:57:04.404]  That's like frontline PBS.
[00:57:05.575 --> 00:57:07.056]  Well, you're chomping at the bit here, Pastor.
[00:57:07.076 --> 00:57:08.498]  We're going to get your take on it.
[00:57:08.738 --> 00:57:09.839]  But you caught it.
[00:57:09.859 --> 00:57:11.120]  That's why I love Pastor Chuck Baldwin.
[00:57:11.140 --> 00:57:11.640]  He's smart.
[00:57:11.900 --> 00:57:13.442]  There's so few people that really get stuff.
[00:57:13.462 --> 00:57:17.245]  And I'm not bragging or also patronizing.
[00:57:17.285 --> 00:57:27.074]  It's true that folks, they're setting the precedent to set up, which they've already built some of them, giant domestic prisons with no due process here for citizens as well instead of Cuba.
[00:57:27.884 --> 00:57:30.386]  And it's like, oh, we demand you close Gitmo!
[00:57:30.586 --> 00:57:31.026]  You bet!
[00:57:31.126 --> 00:57:33.568]  I'll move people here and secretly hold them.
[00:57:33.668 --> 00:57:36.750]  No, Pastor, I saw you like, get that.
[00:57:37.291 --> 00:57:43.035]  You know, we all know about these FEMA cabs that have been popping up all over the country.
[00:57:43.475 --> 00:57:51.200]  We know about the Department of Homeland Security that's buying, you know, all kinds of, how many billion rounds of hollow point ammunition?
[00:57:51.221 --> 00:57:52.361]  Two billion rounds.
[00:57:52.381 --> 00:57:55.403]  A hundred, you know, thousands of tanks.
[00:57:57.765 --> 00:58:00.728]  Weapons and this is all for the Department of Homeland Security.
[00:58:00.748 --> 00:58:03.650]  This is supposed to be domestic enforcement.
[00:58:03.770 --> 00:58:05.892]  So who they plan on using all that against?
[00:58:06.112 --> 00:58:10.435]  I mean, and then he's talking about building a facility like Gitmo in the United States of America.
[00:58:10.495 --> 00:58:14.459]  I mean, oh boy, Alex, just stay on the air, man.
[00:58:14.539 --> 00:58:15.640]  Keep putting this stuff out.
[00:58:15.720 --> 00:58:16.620]  Well, I need your prayers.
[00:58:17.321 --> 00:58:19.143]  Because let me tell you, we're definitely right over the target.
[00:58:19.483 --> 00:58:19.963]  Absolutely.
[00:58:19.983 --> 00:58:22.025]  If you weren't over the target, you wouldn't be catching flack.
[00:58:22.045 --> 00:58:24.187]  Well, they wouldn't put you in the Mike Report as a terrorist.
[00:58:24.968 --> 00:58:25.989]  All that evil Ron Paul.
[00:58:26.109 --> 00:58:27.210]  Yeah, me and Ron Paul.
[00:58:27.490 --> 00:58:31.154]  You know, he says the TSA always gives him double checking, because, you know, he's dangerous.
[00:58:31.214 --> 00:58:33.195]  No criminal record, never had a speeding ticket.
[00:58:33.416 --> 00:58:35.317]  Oh, I could tell you some stories on that myself.
[00:58:35.718 --> 00:58:36.218]  I want to hear it.
[00:58:36.258 --> 00:58:37.880]  We're going into overdrive right now.
[00:58:38.260 --> 00:58:41.002]  Right now, the Mike Judge interview is going up at InfoWars.com in 10 minutes.
[00:58:41.883 --> 00:58:43.625]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:51.034 --> 00:58:56.878]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our immunity and health.
[00:58:57.788 --> 00:59:03.672]  At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of silver-based products.

[00:59:19.621 --> 00:59:25.825]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.
[00:59:26.545 --> 00:59:36.967]  But rather we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the silver more effectively.

[00:59:54.750 --> 00:59:57.954]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:00:05.356 --> 01:00:09.518]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.198 --> 01:00:10.998]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.779 --> 01:00:12.679]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.319 --> 01:00:16.961]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.521 --> 01:00:21.563]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.686 --> 01:00:26.847]  Alright, we're into hour number two.
[01:00:26.907 --> 01:00:27.647]  I'm on the road.
[01:00:27.667 --> 01:00:31.489]  Jakari Jackson and, of course, David Knight doing a great job.
[01:00:31.509 --> 01:00:34.890]  I'm going to be back by Wednesday, but we're going to have Mike Adams in for three hours.
[01:00:35.891 --> 01:00:38.152]  On Wednesday, I'll probably be popping in there as well.
[01:00:38.732 --> 01:00:40.653]  And I'm not sure what we're going to do on tomorrow's show.
[01:00:40.673 --> 01:00:43.634]  I may do it from the road, driving in the bus like I did before.
[01:00:44.915 --> 01:00:47.818]  One time, from the front seat of the bus next to Richard.
[01:00:48.498 --> 01:00:50.019]  So we're going to see what happens tomorrow.
[01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:52.441]  But there's so much breaking news.
[01:00:52.461 --> 01:00:57.686]  If you go up to Infowars.com, George W. Bush suggests Boston bombings were a conspiracy.
[01:00:58.186 --> 01:00:59.547]  Pretty powerful video.
[01:01:00.448 --> 01:01:03.271]  I thought he said never tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories.
[01:01:04.291 --> 01:01:04.492]  U.S.
[01:01:04.512 --> 01:01:07.054]  moves closer to military intervention in Syria.
[01:01:07.094 --> 01:01:07.854]  That's Kurt Nemo's article.
[01:01:08.115 --> 01:01:10.357]  They're already doing military intervention with proxies.
[01:01:10.797 --> 01:01:12.678]  They mean overt military bombing.
[01:01:13.813 --> 01:01:21.339]  And, you know, after they do their deal with Russia, they, like, kind of stage an event, blame their own assets, let the Russians clean out the CIA's own people.
[01:01:21.799 --> 01:01:24.301]  You give us Syria, we'll get our people out of Dagestan.
[01:01:25.253 --> 01:01:26.454]  I mean, this is just amazing.
[01:01:26.954 --> 01:01:30.516]  It's like Hitler and Stalin dividing Poland or something.
[01:01:30.556 --> 01:01:31.497]  That's how government works.
[01:01:31.977 --> 01:01:35.560]  I agree with Seibel Edmunds' breakdown on that a few days ago.
[01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:38.582]  Mother of bombing suspects says it's all lies.
[01:01:38.622 --> 01:01:40.142]  That's all up at InfoWars.com.
[01:01:40.463 --> 01:01:41.223]  Multiple polls.
[01:01:41.263 --> 01:01:44.065]  Americans are more afraid of government than the terrorists.
[01:01:44.105 --> 01:01:44.585]  That's right.
[01:01:44.625 --> 01:01:46.286]  But the government has electronic voting in now.
[01:01:47.327 --> 01:01:49.892]  Yes, it doesn't matter what you want, unless you enforce the Constitution.
[01:01:51.275 --> 01:01:52.878]  And that's just some of what's going to be coming up.
[01:01:53.118 --> 01:01:55.583]  William F. Jasper is going to be joining us.
[01:01:56.184 --> 01:01:59.430]  But putting bookends on this, David Knight, we're talking about the Southern Property Law Center.
[01:02:00.461 --> 01:02:09.444]  That Harper's wrote about in 2007, and they got their tax returns, 501c3, $189.7 million, a lot of it government funding.
[01:02:10.844 --> 01:02:14.225]  Approximately 60% of their total expenses were spent on program services.
[01:02:14.245 --> 01:02:15.105]  They live like kings.
[01:02:15.985 --> 01:02:27.989]  In 2009, that's the latest numbers, and they still, every professional I know, my dad's a dentist, every lawyer he knows, gets mailed the magazine, which I'm always in,
[01:02:28.709 --> 01:02:29.790]  Or almost every time I've seen it.
[01:02:29.890 --> 01:02:39.076]  It's a quarterly magazine where they put toothless Klan members run by feds next to mainline Christian groups, some of the biggest in the country.
[01:02:39.636 --> 01:02:42.698]  I mean, they just say, hey, we shouldn't teach five year olds how to masturbate.
[01:02:43.019 --> 01:02:44.880]  And they're like, these people are evil.
[01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:46.781]  And then the guy goes in and shoots them.
[01:02:46.861 --> 01:02:47.962]  And it's like, so what?
[01:02:48.002 --> 01:02:49.163]  We're liberal.
[01:02:49.503 --> 01:02:51.164]  I mean, it's just it's just over the top.
[01:02:52.205 --> 01:02:54.306]  And again, they're here for an authoritarian takeover.
[01:02:54.346 --> 01:02:55.167]  I'm not just saying that.
[01:02:55.447 --> 01:02:58.329]  David Knight, the final comments on that before I come back and talk to Jasper.
[01:02:59.069 --> 01:03:01.331]  I think what you said earlier, Alex, is the key.
[01:03:01.451 --> 01:03:12.261]  You've got to ask yourself, not only why would the Army attack mainstream organizations like the Family Research Council and the American Family Association, but why is the Army doing this?
[01:03:12.661 --> 01:03:12.921]  Why?
[01:03:12.941 --> 01:03:20.888]  It's kind of like when you saw the Waco, when that was unfolding, we were told that they had to do that to protect the children and that there were child abuse charges.
[01:03:20.948 --> 01:03:21.209]  It's like,
[01:03:21.809 --> 01:03:24.570]  That's not the jurisdiction of the federal ATF.
[01:03:25.010 --> 01:03:27.050]  They could have arrested him in town every day.
[01:03:27.090 --> 01:03:28.251]  They wanted the big fight.
[01:03:28.431 --> 01:03:30.471]  They wanted to kick off the domestic purge.
[01:03:30.531 --> 01:03:34.893]  They hate gun-owning Christians, so they picked a weird group to set the precedent.
[01:03:35.373 --> 01:03:37.533]  These people, these people just don't want power.
[01:03:37.613 --> 01:03:38.314]  They hate us.
[01:03:38.694 --> 01:03:39.854]  You need to figure this out.
[01:03:40.194 --> 01:03:41.054]  It's the same sort of thing here.
[01:03:41.074 --> 01:03:43.916]  You've got to ask yourself, why is the Army weighing in on this?
[01:03:44.296 --> 01:03:53.620]  Why is the Army telling people that the Family Research Council and the American Family Association are hateful groups, that they're hate groups, and they don't share Army values?
[01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:55.941]  By the way, they're incredibly milquetoast.
[01:03:55.981 --> 01:03:56.962]  They're incredibly milquetoast.
[01:03:57.002 --> 01:04:06.206]  I mean, look, the Army document three weeks ago, Fox News, says evangelicals, who by the way are worshiping the Southern Property Law Center, and all Catholics
[01:04:07.186 --> 01:04:08.968]  Are extremists next to Al Qaeda?
[01:04:09.008 --> 01:04:12.632]  I mean, where are the Catholic groups up in arms about this?
[01:04:12.992 --> 01:04:15.695]  That's a big group to say all the Catholics, period.
[01:04:16.015 --> 01:04:16.816]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:04:17.536 --> 01:04:19.298]  So, I guess that's the thing.
[01:04:19.738 --> 01:04:28.227]  That, along with, and we've seen this happening over and over again, we've seen army manuals where they're wargaming in South Carolina against the Tea Party.
[01:04:29.027 --> 01:04:33.190]  We see the MIAC report that was broken by InfoWars back in 2009.
[01:04:33.711 --> 01:04:48.521]  We see this narrative coming over and over again and you have to ask yourself, you know, not only do we have a standing army now, permanent professional standing army, which is against Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution, but now they're definitely turning their sights on the American people.
[01:04:49.246 --> 01:04:49.526]  That's right.
[01:04:49.546 --> 01:04:51.567]  They're demonizing us, saying we're the bad guys.
[01:04:51.587 --> 01:04:56.430]  And then we say, hey, what are the armored vehicles and machine guns and checkpoints and bullets for?
[01:04:56.450 --> 01:04:58.592]  They go, that's a conspiracy theory.
[01:04:58.712 --> 01:04:59.312]  Don't run.
[01:04:59.352 --> 01:05:00.333]  We are your friends.
[01:05:01.013 --> 01:05:04.055]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms.
[01:05:04.415 --> 01:05:09.878]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[01:05:10.459 --> 01:05:13.641]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?

[01:05:57.659 --> 01:05:59.821]  Again, that's GetSimpliSafe.com
[01:06:00.734 --> 01:06:02.655]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[01:06:02.675 --> 01:06:04.937]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[01:06:05.097 --> 01:06:10.341]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[01:06:10.561 --> 01:06:14.344]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[01:06:14.604 --> 01:06:18.366]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[01:06:18.527 --> 01:06:19.727]  The fact is, you are.
[01:06:19.928 --> 01:06:20.708]  We all are.
[01:06:20.948 --> 01:06:23.270]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[01:06:23.590 --> 01:06:31.938]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoods Direct.

[01:08:05.407 --> 01:08:09.589]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:08:10.230 --> 01:08:11.050]  You want answers?
[01:08:11.831 --> 01:08:12.691]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.372 --> 01:08:16.994]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.554 --> 01:08:21.636]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:25.836 --> 01:08:34.262]  All right, coming up at the bottom of the hour, we'll have more breaking news from InfoWars.com, another top liberty-minded site from around the world.
[01:08:35.803 --> 01:08:40.567]  Right now, though, for the balance of the hour, we are joined by William F. Jasper.
[01:08:40.627 --> 01:08:46.851]  He is the senior editor at the New American magazine, TheNewAmerican.com.
[01:08:47.712 --> 01:08:51.455]  And, of course, he also is their main correspondent to the United Nations.
[01:08:51.495 --> 01:08:52.996]  He travels all over the world.
[01:08:53.803 --> 01:08:58.768]  And of course, I followed his work earnestly when I discovered it in about 1993, 94, 95.
[01:08:59.629 --> 01:09:04.495]  The John Birch Society films that were aired on local access TV helped expand my awakening.
[01:09:04.895 --> 01:09:13.164]  I kind of grew up around history and things, so I just knew what they were saying was true because it was verifiable in the, even by the time I was 20 years old, hundreds of history books I had read.
[01:09:14.285 --> 01:09:29.649]  And the first time I met William F. Jasper, personally, I had him on as a guest a few times, was at Operation Urban Warrior, where the military was openly training with role players to confiscate guns in California.
[01:09:29.669 --> 01:09:36.790]  And I was there shooting video of the Navy vessel Coronado dumping out thousands of Marines and troops from five nations.
[01:09:36.830 --> 01:09:39.051]  And I'd go into, they'd say, sure, you can come in with the press, and they would
[01:09:39.571 --> 01:09:42.974]  They would sit there and train and say, where'd you get the guns and ammo and the helmet?
[01:09:42.994 --> 01:09:44.355]  Well, I got it in San Francisco.
[01:09:44.395 --> 01:09:48.258]  And then they'd have a Colonel Jones run up and say, Jones can't film that!
[01:09:48.298 --> 01:09:48.999]  Get out of here!
[01:09:49.319 --> 01:09:50.921]  They'd go, but sir, you said he could be here!
[01:09:51.601 --> 01:09:54.744]  So, and then Colonel Hart would run up on video and get very upset.
[01:09:55.204 --> 01:09:57.406]  So they did not want people seeing what is in Police State 2000.
[01:09:57.606 --> 01:10:00.209]  So the first time I met Jasper then.
[01:10:01.345 --> 01:10:05.606]  Now, the John Birch Society, I want to get him on today, just do a brief history of it.
[01:10:06.566 --> 01:10:15.148]  I'm not a member of it, never been part of it, just because, you know, I've read the material, I guess I'm kind of a, to use the communist term, but in a joking way, a fellow traveler.
[01:10:15.508 --> 01:10:29.552]  I grew up with my dad having their publications and Bobby Vaughn, a John Birch Society member in Dallas, coming over when I was a kid, you know, and I'd hear him around the coffee table drinking coffee, talking about the New World Order, the Federal Reserve, the plan to destroy the family, the plan
[01:10:30.032 --> 01:10:32.853]  The megabanks to create world communism that they're exempt from.
[01:10:33.173 --> 01:10:34.594]  Basically everything we see today.
[01:10:35.494 --> 01:10:45.457]  And I want to get him on about an article he wrote last week that we linked to on Infowars.com dealing with the EU bragging that, oh yes, we're taking over an authoritarian way.
[01:10:45.837 --> 01:10:56.981]  They've also done that in the Financial Times of London bragged in an article called, and now for world government, where they said, yes, we've been secretive, yes, we're authoritarian, yes, we're taking over, and yes, there's nothing you can do.
[01:10:58.341 --> 01:11:03.865]  So they've gone from denying all of this to saying, okay, you're discredited because you don't want world government.
[01:11:03.885 --> 01:11:07.287]  It's kind of like a year ago when they'd only bought a billion bullets, now it's over two billion.
[01:11:08.167 --> 01:11:14.291]  There are no billion bullets, there are no armored vehicles, there are no manuals training to take on the American people and veterans and gun owners.
[01:11:14.771 --> 01:11:20.214]  Now they're like, of course there are manuals to take you on, and of course we have two billion bullets, but they're not to kill you.
[01:11:21.395 --> 01:11:22.916]  That was the new thing in Congress last week.
[01:11:22.936 --> 01:11:24.216]  We played clips on the Sunday show.
[01:11:25.993 --> 01:11:41.265]  If you ever notice when you watch MSNBC or CNN, when somebody talks about freedom, or somebody talks about sovereignty, or somebody talks about NAFTA and GATT, admitted things, or the Trans-Texas Corridor, they'll go, Ron Paul is insane, that NAFTA highway doesn't exist, even though Texans see it being built and saw the billboards.
[01:11:41.846 --> 01:11:43.227]  They're playing to your ignorance.
[01:11:43.667 --> 01:11:45.769]  But you'll always see them, who they're really scared of,
[01:11:47.446 --> 01:11:52.071]  Saying, oh, that sounds like something from the John Birch Society, and then they'll laugh.
[01:11:52.191 --> 01:11:58.037]  And that's an appeal to emotion for ignorant people watching to go, well, when I hear the word John Birch, I better laugh.
[01:11:58.518 --> 01:12:03.443]  The truth is, the John Birch Society, if you watch the things that Mr. Welsh said back in the fifties when it was founded,
[01:12:04.824 --> 01:12:10.566]  When you watch the things they put in the little blue book that I read when I was about 18, all of it has come true.
[01:12:11.707 --> 01:12:12.887]  Not because they were pressing it.
[01:12:12.907 --> 01:12:19.510]  They had good patriots in the military, in the FBI, in the Congress, who were in the hearings where this was all being announced.
[01:12:19.570 --> 01:12:26.613]  They tried to get this all done in the 50s and 60s when they thought the public would totally trust the government after World War II.
[01:12:26.673 --> 01:12:28.053]  People did trust the government, leave it to Beaver.
[01:12:28.433 --> 01:12:29.634]  This was all announced.
[01:12:30.529 --> 01:12:33.570]  Getting rid of our military, creating a UN military via NATO.
[01:12:34.010 --> 01:12:39.152]  So I want to give him the floor now for the rest of the hour to, as best I can, this stuff really gets me excited.
[01:12:40.832 --> 01:12:46.874]  William F. Jasper, to kind of, this little five minute segment left, talk about the John Birch Society, talk about how right they've been.
[01:12:48.107 --> 01:12:49.569]  And why they've been so demonized.
[01:12:49.969 --> 01:12:51.911]  And it's almost put them on the defensive for a while.
[01:12:52.392 --> 01:12:54.394]  I've had their director in studio kind of admit that.
[01:12:54.454 --> 01:12:55.796]  Get off the defense, get on the offense.
[01:12:56.116 --> 01:12:59.720]  So what when traitors sit there and attack you and say you're a liar?
[01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:00.361]  They're the liars.
[01:13:00.921 --> 01:13:02.163]  I mean that's a sign.
[01:13:02.423 --> 01:13:04.185]  And now people don't believe the lies anymore.
[01:13:04.405 --> 01:13:06.527]  And then get into what the EU is forming into.
[01:13:07.288 --> 01:13:28.022]  What the New World Order is from its deep research, because this is, you know, the head honcho over there at the publication, and just really does amazing research, and has been at all these major UN events, or sent his sub-correspondence to it, and then how things are going, after we talk about the history of JBS, then talk about the current state of world government, and then how it's going for them, where he sees things going.
[01:13:28.302 --> 01:13:34.146]  William S. Jasper of TheNewAmerican.com, we salute you, and we're honored to have you, my friend.
[01:13:34.406 --> 01:13:35.227]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[01:13:35.347 --> 01:13:36.568]  Pleasure being here with you.
[01:13:36.588 --> 01:13:41.092]  The setup you gave me here, I'll just walk right into that.
[01:13:41.633 --> 01:13:47.598]  Probably a lot of your listeners are familiar, at least to some degree, with the John Bird Society.
[01:13:47.618 --> 01:13:56.566]  The John Bird Society publishes the New American Magazine, of which I am the senior editor and UN correspondent and kind of chief cook and bottle washer.
[01:14:00.203 --> 01:14:10.629]  My entry into this is probably similar to a lot of members of the John Birch Society, at least of my generation.
[01:14:10.729 --> 01:14:12.230]  I graduated from college in 1975.
[01:14:14.631 --> 01:14:19.714]  But while I was in college my last couple of years, my parents had become
[01:14:20.712 --> 01:14:22.094]  Members of the John Birch Society.
[01:14:22.454 --> 01:14:24.497]  And when I found out about that, I was shocked.
[01:14:24.557 --> 01:14:25.418]  I was dismayed.
[01:14:25.498 --> 01:14:28.702]  I was completely perplexed.
[01:14:28.742 --> 01:14:29.963]  How could this happen?
[01:14:30.304 --> 01:14:37.292]  Because I knew nothing about the John Birch Society, except that somewhere in my deep subconscious, I had this
[01:14:38.272 --> 01:14:49.943]  Uh, image of the John Burt Saria as being a very evil, uh, fascist organization, uh, racist organization somehow connected with the Ku Klux Klan or something like that.
[01:14:50.703 --> 01:14:57.930]  And I found out that a lot of my other, uh, friends on campus, colleagues, uh, had pretty much the same impression.
[01:14:58.410 --> 01:14:59.371]  And so I thought, well,
[01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:01.841]  I had better educate my parents.
[01:15:01.861 --> 01:15:02.582]  They're good people.
[01:15:02.662 --> 01:15:04.023]  They certainly aren't fascists.
[01:15:04.103 --> 01:15:08.946]  They were both World War II veterans, fought against the Nazis over in Germany and France, etc.
[01:15:08.986 --> 01:15:10.047]  My mother's an Army nurse.
[01:15:10.087 --> 01:15:13.550]  My dad, 82nd Airborne paratrooper.
[01:15:13.650 --> 01:15:14.911]  Good patriotic people.
[01:15:15.511 --> 01:15:19.054]  My job is the college-educated son to educate them.
[01:15:20.034 --> 01:15:22.476]  And so I started discussing this with them.
[01:15:22.536 --> 01:15:24.458]  They gave me a whole stack of literature.
[01:15:25.478 --> 01:15:29.081]  At that time, the John Birch Society magazine was American Opinion.
[01:15:33.118 --> 01:15:42.561]  So you thought you were going to straighten them up with all your Rockefeller Foundation-funded college schooling, and they actually straightened you up?
[01:15:42.761 --> 01:15:43.081]  Right.
[01:15:43.161 --> 01:15:53.644]  I mean, they gave me a whole stack of books by Ludwig von Mises and Henry Hazlitt and Frederick Hayek, and I started reading all those, and I'd been studying economics.
[01:15:54.144 --> 01:15:56.107]  My gosh, how come I've never been exposed to this?
[01:15:56.167 --> 01:16:03.938]  These are top-notch, world-level economists, free-market economists, and why haven't I been exposed to this?
[01:16:04.699 --> 01:16:06.883]  So I began doing a lot of research.
[01:16:06.923 --> 01:16:08.946]  It was very hard for me to overcome.
[01:16:09.634 --> 01:16:23.686]  The biases that I had built into me already, but I spent a lot of time at the university library checking the footnotes, making sure that things weren't being quoted out of context.
[01:16:23.906 --> 01:16:28.610]  And I found myself being reluctantly re-educated.
[01:16:28.630 --> 01:16:29.231]  And I thought, gee,
[01:16:30.223 --> 01:16:31.464]  A lot of this makes sense.
[01:16:31.624 --> 01:16:35.865]  They're calling for constitutional government.
[01:16:35.885 --> 01:16:40.027]  They're calling for getting back to constitutional government.
[01:16:40.047 --> 01:16:41.507]  They're calling for America.
[01:16:41.647 --> 01:16:42.087]  That's right.
[01:16:42.207 --> 01:16:42.567]  That's right.
[01:16:42.627 --> 01:16:52.611]  And they're not only opposed to communism and socialism, but fascism, Nazism, any of the collectivist ideological movements and parties.
[01:16:53.271 --> 01:16:56.692]  Was it John Birch Society's big evil opposing the Vietnam War, rightly?
[01:16:56.972 --> 01:16:58.153]  Oh, that's so fascist.
[01:16:58.773 --> 01:17:00.394]  Right, and they opposed it.
[01:17:01.434 --> 01:17:08.016]  The John Birch Society opposed it, not for the same reasons that the SDS and the leftists were opposing it.
[01:17:08.056 --> 01:17:10.137]  Those people were calling for a Viet Cong victory.
[01:17:10.857 --> 01:17:18.200]  The John Birch Society said, no, it's wrong for us to be over there supporting, or rather, pretending to fight communism.
[01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:23.242]  They're what we're allowing Castro to build a dictatorship right here at our doorstep.
[01:17:23.703 --> 01:17:28.073]  They rightly understood that it was Hegelian dialectic with the globalists playing both sides of it.
[01:17:28.534 --> 01:17:31.481]  Talk about the name John Birch Society for people that don't know the story.
[01:17:32.153 --> 01:17:38.136]  Well, John Birch was a Baptist missionary just preceding World War II over in China.
[01:17:38.836 --> 01:17:46.839]  And, long story short, he had learned Chinese and various Chinese dialects.
[01:17:47.239 --> 01:17:50.261]  He could identify very well with the Chinese people there.
[01:17:50.701 --> 01:17:57.484]  When World War II broke out and the Japanese invaded China, all of the foreign missionaries left, except for him.
[01:17:58.384 --> 01:18:02.387]  He stayed behind, disguised himself as Chinese, traveled all over China.
[01:18:03.147 --> 01:18:13.234]  When we entered into the war, he began, and Jimmy Doolittle began doing his flights over China, bombing the Japanese thing.
[01:18:13.334 --> 01:18:17.477]  American pilots were being shot down or were being forced to abandon their planes.
[01:18:18.097 --> 01:18:27.043]  And he developed a network to have, amongst the Chinese there, to build landing strips and to have smuggling.
[01:18:27.743 --> 01:18:28.224]  We're good.
[01:18:42.908 --> 01:18:43.409]  I think?
[01:18:58.262 --> 01:19:00.925]  Uh, he was given one last commission.
[01:19:01.306 --> 01:19:11.300]  He was a missionary, but he was commissioned as a captain in the US Army because of his intelligence capabilities there.
[01:19:11.981 --> 01:19:14.425]  And he was given one last mission, which was to go up
[01:19:15.422 --> 01:19:23.948]  Northern China to escort out the Japanese Army so that they wouldn't be, after the armistice, so they wouldn't be molested.
[01:19:24.728 --> 01:19:26.570]  And he was stopped by Chinese Communists.
[01:19:45.982 --> 01:19:47.543]  We would not have known all this info.
[01:19:47.563 --> 01:19:51.325]  I'm telling you, they were the launch pad for the entire giant resistance today.
[01:19:51.785 --> 01:19:56.967]  And everybody should be a part of the John Birch Society, or at least get their materials, because they're the best you're going to find anywhere.
[01:19:57.307 --> 01:19:58.027]  We'll be right back.
[01:19:58.047 --> 01:19:58.468]  Stay with us.
[01:19:58.528 --> 01:19:59.188]  I'm Alex Jones.

[01:20:11.156 --> 01:20:13.358]  The best way to keep your guns is to hide them.
[01:20:13.518 --> 01:20:16.019]  What Obama can't find, Obama can't take away.

[01:22:06.154 --> 01:22:08.795]  Soft and broken in from the start.
[01:22:09.015 --> 01:22:12.237]  Yet more rugged and durable than any jean you've ever worn.
[01:22:12.917 --> 01:22:15.538]  Have you ever experienced missized jeans from China?
[01:22:15.918 --> 01:22:17.539]  Well you won't with Diamond Gusset.

[01:23:01.084 --> 01:23:01.785]  Nice shooting.
[01:23:01.965 --> 01:23:04.668]  Hey, that's a sweet AK-47 chest rig.
[01:23:04.708 --> 01:23:05.749]  Is that multicam?
[01:23:05.769 --> 01:23:08.312]  Yep, got it from strikehardgear.com.
[01:23:08.472 --> 01:23:09.192]  Strike what?
[01:23:09.813 --> 01:23:11.134]  Strike hard.

[01:23:27.074 --> 01:23:28.756]  Go ahead, pull the trigger.
[01:23:28.996 --> 01:23:38.262]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[01:23:38.302 --> 01:23:39.043]  This capitalism?
[01:23:39.103 --> 01:23:45.247]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:23:45.387 --> 01:23:46.147]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[01:23:46.188 --> 01:23:49.290]  I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[01:23:49.350 --> 01:23:50.270]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[01:23:50.290 --> 01:23:51.611]  It's time to understand the system.
[01:23:51.671 --> 01:23:51.951]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:23:51.991 --> 01:23:52.272]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:23:58.916 --> 01:23:59.000]  Yeah.
[01:24:16.101 --> 01:24:21.625]  Fitting music to talk about the John Birch Society helping get the Flying Tigers into there to fight the Japanese.
[01:24:21.665 --> 01:24:29.011]  And then of course at the end of the war it was the John Birch Society that first said in the 50s that Mao had been put in power by our government.
[01:24:29.311 --> 01:24:31.053]  That was declassified about a decade ago.
[01:24:31.093 --> 01:24:32.294]  I was watching Discovery Channel.
[01:24:32.654 --> 01:24:33.435]  Was it History Channel?
[01:24:33.455 --> 01:24:35.618]  They had the old CIA section chief admit it.
[01:24:35.638 --> 01:24:36.859]  And then I went and looked it up.
[01:24:36.899 --> 01:24:43.207]  There'd been an announcement in the news that, oh, the government thought Mao would be a stabilizing effect, the greatest mass murder in history.
[01:24:43.247 --> 01:24:49.956]  But we'll talk about what happened to old John Birch when he tried to actually help the Chinese people he loved so much against tyranny.
[01:24:50.376 --> 01:24:54.159]  Okay, so he's helped defeat the Japanese against the millions the Japanese killed.
[01:24:54.520 --> 01:25:01.145]  Incredible war crimes there that dwarf what happened to the US, or even the Koreans for that matter, that the Japanese viciously attacked.
[01:25:01.165 --> 01:25:05.229]  I'm not demonizing Japanese now, that's just Imperial Japan, we're like the Nazis.
[01:25:05.649 --> 01:25:13.716]  Now expanding, go ahead and finish with what happened, William F. Jasper, editor-in-chief over there, senior editor over there at the New America Magazine.
[01:25:14.312 --> 01:25:22.679]  Well, Captain John Birch was sent to escort out the Japanese army out of northern China.
[01:25:23.599 --> 01:25:31.686]  And on his way there, he was stopped by Chinese Communist troops and was murdered by them.
[01:25:32.681 --> 01:25:36.603]  And that is not surprising, because that's what communists do.
[01:25:36.803 --> 01:25:50.428]  But remember, this is the end of World War II, and Americans, or the triumphant victors, could be very bad news to kill an American hero.
[01:25:50.468 --> 01:26:01.152]  I mean, John Birch should have received numerous additional citations, to which he did receive, and probably would have gotten a Medal of Honor, things of that nature, except for
[01:26:02.052 --> 01:26:04.053]  This murder was covered up.
[01:26:04.793 --> 01:26:05.753]  Why was it covered up?
[01:26:05.873 --> 01:26:12.515]  Our State Department, which was being run by communists at that time... Wasn't he also tortured?
[01:26:12.535 --> 01:26:14.435]  Yes, he was tortured, bayoneted, and murdered.
[01:26:21.227 --> 01:26:46.223]  And this wouldn't fly very well, though, with our State Department and our government, the Roosevelt and Truman administrations, trying to convince the American people that the Chinese Communists under Mao Zedong and Xu Te were our allies, going to be the people that we should be turning China over to, which is what we did.
[01:26:46.243 --> 01:26:48.084]  They began demonizing.
[01:26:49.345 --> 01:26:49.725]  Thank you.
[01:27:09.682 --> 01:27:13.123]  You've had the sugar daddy or sugar babies or whatever, he's the guy that invented those.
[01:27:13.803 --> 01:27:23.946]  And he had poured all of his money into alerting the American people about the dangers of socialism and big government here at home and of communism abroad.
[01:27:24.447 --> 01:27:34.009]  Now, for younger generations today who don't even know who Stalin or Mao or Fidel Castro is or were and have no idea about the
[01:27:36.090 --> 01:27:49.661]  Climate in the 1940s 50s and 60s 70s when communism was taking over one country after another that might be hard to fathom but Americans at that time understood that there was something really bad in the world.
[01:27:49.681 --> 01:27:56.186]  There's this world revolution going on where totalitarianism was being fastened on one country after another.
[01:27:56.446 --> 01:27:59.288]  Millions of people were being slaughtered and tortured and imprisoned.
[01:27:59.989 --> 01:28:00.909]  So, Robert Welch,
[01:28:02.133 --> 01:28:05.075]  He was founded an organization.
[01:28:05.275 --> 01:28:22.884]  He named it after John Birch because he saw that Captain John Birch was an exemplary American who embodied everything that this country was great about this country and had been, as he said, was the first victim of World War III.
[01:28:22.964 --> 01:28:31.489]  After World War II, the big war for the world, communist totalitarianism, was underway and John Birch was the first victim.
[01:28:32.250 --> 01:28:37.918]  And by the way, the globalists, as you know, decades later now call that World War III.
[01:28:40.081 --> 01:28:45.869]  And so again, just so much that John Birch envisioned has actually become even mainline nomenclature in the technocracy.
[01:28:46.604 --> 01:29:07.687]  Yes, well, one of the things that Robert Welch recognized, and this is the reason why he and the John Birch Society were so demonized by the same mainstream media, the MSM-controlled corporate media, is that he was exposing the larger picture, and that is that
[01:29:09.208 --> 01:29:19.933]  Communism wasn't succeeding and all these millions of deaths were not just the result of the Communists being so powerful and cunning and adept at taking over.
[01:29:19.953 --> 01:29:30.398]  They had indisputable, absolutely necessary help in the highest positions of power in some of the free world countries.
[01:29:30.858 --> 01:29:31.899]  All right, stay there.
[01:29:31.919 --> 01:29:38.745]  I want to finish up with that and then leap forward to the grandchildren and sons and daughters of these globalists.
[01:29:39.165 --> 01:29:44.470]  What they're doing today, now they're out in the open, and what's currently happening and what you see happening in the future.
[01:29:44.730 --> 01:29:47.433]  With William F. Jasper, straight ahead of the New American Magazine.
[01:29:47.513 --> 01:29:48.293]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:29:50.035 --> 01:29:50.916]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.436 --> 01:29:53.017]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.958 --> 01:29:56.640]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.107 --> 01:30:12.433]  With health threats on the rise such as West Nile virus, MRSA, CRE, and now the new bird flu recently discovered in China, there has never been a more crucial time to support your immune system.
[01:30:12.733 --> 01:30:25.621]  Supernatural Silver is a revolutionary new silver solution that is clinically shown to be several hundred times more effective than colloidal or ionic silver, and is powerful enough to help protect you and your family.
[01:30:25.941 --> 01:30:29.943]  Supernatural Silver is scientifically supported, highly effective,
[01:30:30.163 --> 01:30:33.505]  And perfect for everyday use inside the body as well as out.
[01:30:33.665 --> 01:30:35.286]  The Science Digest Journal says,
[01:31:00.443 --> 01:31:07.428]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[01:31:07.668 --> 01:31:25.301]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[01:31:25.561 --> 01:31:29.664]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[01:31:29.944 --> 01:31:31.525]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[01:31:31.705 --> 01:31:39.551]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.

[01:32:05.713 --> 01:32:10.119]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[01:32:10.259 --> 01:32:12.602]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride.
[01:32:12.842 --> 01:32:16.227]  And up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[01:32:16.347 --> 01:32:27.341]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.
[01:32:27.361 --> 01:32:30.025]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gates!

[01:33:10.134 --> 01:33:12.315]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[01:33:12.816 --> 01:33:15.277]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:33:15.778 --> 01:33:18.179]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:33:18.500 --> 01:33:21.141]  Alright.
[01:33:36.610 --> 01:33:38.572]  All right, my friends, we are back live.
[01:33:38.632 --> 01:33:44.356]  William F. Jasper is our guest until five after next hour, and then I'll introduce Gerald Cilente at eight after.
[01:33:44.396 --> 01:33:47.078]  He's going to guest host the broadcast today.
[01:33:47.098 --> 01:33:52.622]  Very excited to have Gerald Cilente, one of our most popular guests and very informative gentleman, doing that.
[01:33:53.243 --> 01:33:56.025]  A bunch of things that are happening here.
[01:33:56.385 --> 01:34:02.410]  We can thank another station turning the show on, KSET 1300 AM in Beaumont, Texas.
[01:34:03.346 --> 01:34:05.568]  We're excited to have them joining the team.
[01:34:05.648 --> 01:34:13.753]  KSET 1300 AM will be airing the live weekday show starting in just a couple days on May 2nd.
[01:34:14.434 --> 01:34:15.294]  So I'll plug them then.
[01:34:15.875 --> 01:34:25.041]  And also we have a lot of stations that are now carrying the show twice a day and also some stations going 24 hours a day like Jacksonville, Florida.
[01:34:25.441 --> 01:34:32.726]  As always, we want to thank all of those AM and FM affiliates out there for carrying the broadcast.
[01:34:33.326 --> 01:34:39.013]  Also, we're not funded by stimulus money or banker bailout money like General Electric funding MSNBC.
[01:34:39.774 --> 01:34:40.595]  We are 100% funded.
[01:34:41.136 --> 01:34:49.025]  We're not funded by the Koch brothers funding the kind of fake right wing either, which we were, because I'd take money and fund Liberty, period.
[01:34:50.346 --> 01:34:51.548]  There's no strings attached here.
[01:34:51.868 --> 01:34:53.490]  Give it to me, but I'm being sarcastic.
[01:34:53.750 --> 01:34:59.737]  The point here is we're funded by you buying books, videos, t-shirts, ball caps, clicking on our sponsors.
[01:35:00.477 --> 01:35:02.920]  We're funded by you spreading the word about the broadcast.
[01:35:02.940 --> 01:35:07.185]  We're funded by you supporting our local AM and FM stations, supporting those local sponsors.
[01:35:07.765 --> 01:35:13.009]  It really helps to let shops know you're coming in because they sponsor the show or if you're a business to become a sponsor.
[01:35:13.289 --> 01:35:14.750]  That's how we fund this operation.
[01:35:14.830 --> 01:35:15.951]  I'm hiring more reporters.
[01:35:16.411 --> 01:35:17.752]  I'm getting satellite feeds.
[01:35:17.932 --> 01:35:18.693]  You see what we're doing.
[01:35:18.953 --> 01:35:22.156]  A year ago, I cut that ad saying, we're going to the next level.
[01:35:22.616 --> 01:35:23.256]  I am going to go 110%.
[01:35:23.296 --> 01:35:26.459]  That's why I got black circles around my eyes.
[01:35:28.160 --> 01:35:34.725]  And I've been working 18 hours a day, many, many days, three, four days a week for the last year.
[01:35:35.445 --> 01:35:41.674]  And I have sworn on the altar of God, eternal resistance against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[01:35:42.355 --> 01:35:46.501]  And sometimes I do it in a ham-fisted way, but folks, pray for me, I'm doing the best I can.
[01:35:47.121 --> 01:35:50.246]  And, you know, God works in mysterious ways, so thanks for putting up with me.
[01:35:50.706 --> 01:35:52.367]  But I am your humble servant here in Liberty.
[01:35:52.727 --> 01:35:53.427]  I love my children.
[01:35:53.447 --> 01:35:54.207]  I want them to be free.
[01:35:54.227 --> 01:35:55.828]  I want them to live in a world with your children.
[01:35:56.088 --> 01:35:58.409]  And I want them to grow up and have grandchildren who have grandchildren.
[01:35:58.649 --> 01:36:02.711]  And we'll go to the stars together if we don't let the King Rat scum take over.
[01:36:02.731 --> 01:36:05.752]  We're going back to Jasper here in a moment to give him the real floor.
[01:36:05.772 --> 01:36:09.233]  He's just breaking down amazing history here to understand what's brought us to this point.
[01:36:09.573 --> 01:36:11.334]  A snapshot of those that came before us.
[01:36:12.383 --> 01:36:13.544]  And we stand on their shoulders.
[01:36:13.744 --> 01:36:18.106]  Don't forget, you can also buy the ProPure water filtration, 10% off with promo code WATER.
[01:36:18.206 --> 01:36:20.807]  The best gravity-fed stainless steel filters out there.
[01:36:21.047 --> 01:36:22.148]  I went out and found the best.
[01:36:22.448 --> 01:36:24.029]  It's what I and my family use.
[01:36:24.929 --> 01:36:26.670]  It's what we use on the road in the RV.
[01:36:27.250 --> 01:36:28.831]  It is the best, the lowest price.
[01:36:28.931 --> 01:36:32.093]  Infowarsstore.com with promo code WATER.
[01:36:32.393 --> 01:36:34.874]  You can also call and get it with that same promo code 888-253-3139.
[01:36:34.894 --> 01:36:34.934]  888-253-3139.
[01:36:39.016 --> 01:36:39.657]  We're good to go.
[01:37:02.677 --> 01:37:05.619]  We have just sold out of the April issue.
[01:37:06.239 --> 01:37:09.882]  So the new magazines arrive tomorrow, 110,000 of them.
[01:37:10.342 --> 01:37:13.464]  Each magazine has three InfoWars.com stickers.
[01:37:13.904 --> 01:37:15.505]  One of them says, Save the Constitution.
[01:37:15.846 --> 01:37:17.226]  The other says InfoWars.com.
[01:37:17.246 --> 01:37:18.547]  The other says PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:37:18.948 --> 01:37:23.991]  The average bumper sticker gets to about 20,000 people, they estimate, on some of the marketing sites I've read.
[01:37:24.011 --> 01:37:26.532]  20,000, at least if they're on a car.
[01:37:26.552 --> 01:37:28.674]  A little bit less if it's on a book bag or something else.
[01:37:28.694 --> 01:37:29.794]  The point is, 20,000 people.
[01:37:29.814 --> 01:37:30.615]  Let's say it's 1,000 people.
[01:37:32.236 --> 01:37:35.178]  The point is, this is an aggressive operation.
[01:37:35.218 --> 01:37:43.163]  Please get the new magazine, give it to friends and family, and then also put the bumper stickers on your own property, or give it to others to put on their own property.
[01:37:43.203 --> 01:37:46.726]  Please don't put it on anybody else's property, though I'm sure provocateurs will do that.
[01:37:46.766 --> 01:37:47.646]  That's not our problem.
[01:37:48.387 --> 01:37:50.929]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, duty is ours.
[01:37:51.489 --> 01:37:52.990]  Consequences belong to God.
[01:37:53.010 --> 01:37:58.294]  InfoWarsStore.com, and don't forget we've launched the new InfoWars Seed Center.
[01:37:59.134 --> 01:38:02.257]  And don't forget the New American Magazine also.
[01:38:02.598 --> 01:38:04.920]  Very important to support those Patriots as well.
[01:38:04.960 --> 01:38:06.882]  We'll tell you how to subscribe before Jasper leaves.
[01:38:07.202 --> 01:38:14.209]  Okay, we've got like 14 minutes left in this segment, then 5 minutes, then another 5 minutes, then we've got Gerald Cilente coming up at 8 after.
[01:38:14.249 --> 01:38:15.691]  But we've got William F. Jasper here.
[01:38:16.211 --> 01:38:19.014]  Finish up with, you had just gotten to the point,
[01:38:20.274 --> 01:38:45.013]  of trying to basically put Mao in and then discovering that there were ultra-rich funding communism while using it as a dialectic to build a police state here, and then get into the current EU stuff you've been breaking and their own admissions, and then where you see us going, where you think the battle is, because I really respect your perspective as somebody who's been in this battle for 30 years, William F. Jasper.
[01:38:46.518 --> 01:38:47.559]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:38:47.619 --> 01:38:49.381]  Actually, it's almost 40 years now.
[01:38:49.781 --> 01:38:50.602]  Wow.
[01:38:50.622 --> 01:38:50.602]  37.
[01:38:51.863 --> 01:39:13.162]  So, well, we were talking at the end there, a huge, huge, momentous shift in the whole planet following World War II, with communism taking over much of Europe, much of Asia, including all of China.
[01:39:14.544 --> 01:39:24.954]  And that was happening at the same time that the United Nations was being founded, the incipient world government that was founded in 1945.
[01:39:25.035 --> 01:39:31.822]  Now, you and I were brought up in schools, I believe, until I went away to college.
[01:39:32.482 --> 01:39:33.703]  Actually, while I was in college.
[01:39:34.745 --> 01:39:37.228]  I became familiar with the John Birch Society.
[01:39:37.609 --> 01:39:49.966]  The United Nations was this glorious, wonderful, great big brotherhood of man that was founded at the end of World War II because the people of the world decided we couldn't have war anymore because of the atomic bomb.
[01:39:51.508 --> 01:40:00.513]  We had to find a way of getting past all our differences, so we'd all join hands and sing Kumbaya, and we'd join together the United Nations, and we'd all live in peace, harmony, brotherhood.
[01:40:01.954 --> 01:40:05.556]  At least that was the aspiration, or so we were told.
[01:40:06.636 --> 01:40:07.457]  Nothing of the kind.
[01:40:07.817 --> 01:40:18.343]  As I began looking into the first big disillusionment for me was G. Edward Griffin's book, The Fearful Master, A Second Look at the United Nations.
[01:40:18.403 --> 01:40:20.244]  You've had it on your program, I'm sure.
[01:40:21.581 --> 01:40:38.786]  But that just began a big transformation for me and understanding that really right from the very beginning we had two major forces working together hand-in-hand to use to build this United Nations into a world government which would be tyrannical.
[01:40:38.886 --> 01:40:43.888]  And the two hands that were joined together were first of all the Communists.
[01:40:44.848 --> 01:40:48.469]  Stalin's agent, Pesensky, was the main guy involved in
[01:40:48.729 --> 01:40:49.309]  We're good to go.
[01:41:13.138 --> 01:41:13.639]  I think?
[01:41:26.392 --> 01:41:26.632]  I think?
[01:41:44.364 --> 01:41:56.393]  He became head of the International Monetary Fund, and then he was followed by Virginius Frank Coe, another CFR member, member of the Communist Party, who finally left and went to live in China.
[01:41:57.973 --> 01:42:01.975]  But the International Monetary Fund is still with us, as is the United Nations.
[01:42:02.035 --> 01:42:25.447]  And in fact, the International Monetary Fund, this is one of the areas I've been writing extensively on for the last several years, is the big push by the Council on Foreign Relations and their other adjuncts around the world to transform the International Monetary Fund into a Federal Reserve of the world, to give it all of the powers that we now have in the Federal Reserve to control the monetary and fiscal policy of the world.
[01:42:26.387 --> 01:42:34.651]  And you wrote that something like 25 years ago, correct me if I'm wrong, and now it's mainstream news, but we're still kooks if we talk about it.
[01:42:35.791 --> 01:42:37.412]  I mean, it's just amazing.
[01:42:37.472 --> 01:42:46.536]  What is it like for you, I've got to ask this, to now see everything that Welch talked about 50 years ago actually come true exactly as he said?
[01:42:46.556 --> 01:42:50.038]  I mean, what incredible intelligence JBS had back then.
[01:42:50.278 --> 01:42:52.839]  I mean, I don't think it would have had any chance if it wasn't for you guys.
[01:42:54.500 --> 01:42:55.981]  I don't know.
[01:43:13.018 --> 01:43:40.416]  The Tea Party and every other conservative organization, religious organization, if you're opposed to any of the agenda, and it's sweeping across, the agenda is to completely transform the United States, to destroy all morality, destroy our economy, to force us into interdependence, to destroy our national sovereignty, and that's being stripped away from us right now as we see more and more of these
[01:43:41.056 --> 01:43:53.958]  United Nations treaties, the Law of the Sea, what they're trying to push through with the Global Arms Treaty, with all of the global environmental treaties and agreements.
[01:43:54.933 --> 01:44:06.676]  I was at the Earth Summit in 1992 and saw and reported on all of the things of Agenda 21, the Biodiversity Treaty and the global warming back then.
[01:44:07.176 --> 01:44:22.019]  And so it's frustrating to be years or decades ahead of where most people see the danger on the horizon.
[01:44:23.392 --> 01:44:34.534]  One of the other areas that we wrote about extensively, and I covered extensively over the years, and now it's becoming quite apparent, is the European Union.
[01:44:35.174 --> 01:44:44.096]  Our correspondent, Hilaire Duberrier, had been writing about that for 50 years, since the beginning of what was then the European coal and steel community.
[01:44:44.136 --> 01:44:50.237]  And he had written about all of the people who were the socialists and one-worlders behind it, right from the start.
[01:44:50.977 --> 01:44:54.158]  And he was kind of a lone voice at that time.
[01:44:54.178 --> 01:44:57.319]  He was a very close colleague of mine.
[01:44:57.379 --> 01:45:04.921]  I regarded him as one of my teachers and got very close to him.
[01:45:05.381 --> 01:45:14.584]  And Hilaire Duberrier really wrote the whole book on the history of what we now know as the European Union.
[01:45:15.204 --> 01:45:17.285]  And this is very important because
[01:45:18.285 --> 01:45:27.368]  The European Union has destroyed the national sovereignty of its member states through deception, through bribery, through coercion.
[01:45:28.068 --> 01:45:41.492]  But all the while, when it was being proposed, and every step along the way as it gained new powers, legislative, executive, and judicial powers, the designers, the architects of it, swore
[01:45:42.032 --> 01:45:43.313]  Over and over again, publicly.
[01:45:43.874 --> 01:45:46.376]  This is not going to compromise our national sovereignty.
[01:45:46.416 --> 01:45:49.378]  This is not in any way going to overrule.
[01:45:49.398 --> 01:45:56.284]  We're not going to have a central bureaucracy that's going to ruin home rule, local rule.
[01:45:56.604 --> 01:45:59.947]  Now, as you pointed out earlier, now they come out, well, of course we have to.
[01:45:59.987 --> 01:46:05.071]  We can't have a federal state without giving up national sovereignty.
[01:46:05.392 --> 01:46:07.794]  And now they're trying to promote that.
[01:46:09.895 --> 01:46:21.604]  On a new level, with this transatlantic trade and investment partnership with the United States, which is now President Obama has asked for fast track authority to push through Congress.
[01:46:22.124 --> 01:46:28.589]  And so that's going to be one of the, that is one of the battles right before us now, because if they can push that through,
[01:46:30.083 --> 01:46:33.766]  Then again, we have no recourse.
[01:46:33.806 --> 01:46:49.322]  We'll follow down the same road that the nations of Europe have gone in having transnational courts, transnational legislatures, parliaments, etc., control every aspect of our lives.
[01:46:49.422 --> 01:46:52.325]  There will be no recourses that people of Europe are finding out.
[01:46:56.792 --> 01:46:59.733]  William, doesn't it come down to this?
[01:47:00.733 --> 01:47:07.035]  Doesn't it come down to the fact that big mega wealthy love monopolies as they openly talk about?
[01:47:07.375 --> 01:47:13.097]  Because then there's no competition and they just basically buy off the governments and then shut down their competition.
[01:47:13.637 --> 01:47:16.838]  And then on top of it they're basically eugenicists who think there's too many people.
[01:47:16.858 --> 01:47:19.239]  So, you know, why not cut the resources off?
[01:47:19.279 --> 01:47:21.279]  I mean, what's at the bottom of the rabbit hole?
[01:47:21.359 --> 01:47:23.520]  If they get their world government, what are they going to set up?
[01:47:24.298 --> 01:47:34.123]  Well, I think we can have history, as Patrick Henry said, have no lamp to guide my path except for the light of history.
[01:47:34.403 --> 01:47:38.646]  And we know that absolute power corrupts.
[01:47:39.226 --> 01:47:39.846]  Absolutely.
[01:47:40.127 --> 01:47:47.490]  And we've seen that in every communist, Nazi, fascist, dictatorship of any kind.
[01:47:47.771 --> 01:47:51.613]  And the fact that these folks who
[01:47:53.354 --> 01:48:01.959]  Are promoting this now happen to be so-called respectable bankers and presidents and secretaries of state and whatnot.
[01:48:03.159 --> 01:48:09.483]  Once they have total power, they are human beings that flows automatically and when we know
[01:48:10.303 --> 01:48:16.348]  Their actual history, many of these people are certifiable megalomaniacs.
[01:48:16.488 --> 01:48:24.354]  They want to have total power, and no one who has total power and wants total power will use it beneficently.
[01:48:25.038 --> 01:48:25.418]  I agree.
[01:48:25.478 --> 01:48:26.899]  More and more we see an endgame.
[01:48:26.959 --> 01:48:33.184]  The billions of bullets, the armored vehicles, the army manuals saying that mainline Christian groups are bad.
[01:48:34.104 --> 01:48:37.126]  I mean, this is what you'd expect a weatherman to do if they were president.
[01:48:38.627 --> 01:48:44.011]  Do you agree with me that things are now moving at mock speed because they're behind on their timetable, as Brzezinski has said?
[01:48:44.051 --> 01:48:45.832]  Or where do you see the world right now?
[01:48:46.032 --> 01:48:52.858]  It's very clear that they have missed quite a number of very important datelines along the way.
[01:48:54.019 --> 01:48:58.283]  In terms of putting through, for instance, the Free Trade Area of the Americas.
[01:48:58.343 --> 01:49:02.686]  In terms of getting the Declaration of Interdependence.
[01:49:02.806 --> 01:49:08.451]  All of these things which we've published numerous times.
[01:49:08.671 --> 01:49:11.414]  The carbon tax four years ago when that got leaked.
[01:49:11.694 --> 01:49:13.716]  I mean, we're having victories when we engage them.
[01:49:14.238 --> 01:49:14.758]  Absolutely.
[01:49:14.838 --> 01:49:21.201]  And so there is a seeming frenetic activity going on.
[01:49:21.241 --> 01:49:23.963]  But you know, if you go back to one of the signal
[01:49:24.821 --> 01:49:26.322]  I'm sure you have as well.
[01:49:44.452 --> 01:49:53.016]  I mean, he's served on a number of... He wrote an article called The Hard Road to World Order, and it's one of the most important ones.
[01:49:53.076 --> 01:50:12.365]  There's many others like it, but one of the phrases that he used in there is he said, as this happens, as we begin forming this world government through regional arrangements on environment, on the economy, on security, etc., it will look like a booming, buzzing confusion.
[01:50:12.925 --> 01:50:14.726]  In other words, there's going to be all this activity.
[01:50:14.806 --> 01:50:17.626]  It's going to be hard for people to keep their eyes on it.
[01:50:17.666 --> 01:50:21.208]  But out of this confusion, they have a plan.
[01:50:21.248 --> 01:50:29.010]  It's going to create this new world order in which, through all these regional arrangements, the national sovereignties are destroyed.
[01:50:29.050 --> 01:50:36.792]  And first, the world order as it was of nation states is disaggregated.
[01:50:37.332 --> 01:50:42.294]  And then it is brought back together in this new aggregation of a new world order.
[01:50:42.794 --> 01:50:43.194]  That's right.
[01:51:00.779 --> 01:51:01.239]  The other side.
[01:51:01.259 --> 01:51:12.548]  With health threats on the rise such as West Nile virus, MRSA, CRE, and now the new bird flu recently discovered in China, there has never been a more crucial time to support your immune system.
[01:51:12.848 --> 01:51:25.759]  Supernatural Silver is a revolutionary new silver solution that is clinically shown to be several hundred times more effective than colloidal or ionic silver, and is powerful enough to help protect you and your family.
[01:51:26.079 --> 01:51:30.082]  Supernatural Silver is scientifically supported, highly effective,
[01:51:30.302 --> 01:51:33.644]  And perfect for everyday use inside the body as well as out.
[01:51:33.784 --> 01:51:35.405]  The Science Digest Journal says,
[01:52:00.522 --> 01:52:05.543]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[01:53:00.343 --> 01:53:02.243]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[01:53:02.283 --> 01:53:04.524]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[01:53:04.664 --> 01:53:09.886]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[01:53:10.107 --> 01:53:13.868]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[01:53:14.128 --> 01:53:15.949]  You may think out of sight, out of mind,
[01:53:16.209 --> 01:53:17.851]  And so you don't think you will be affected.
[01:53:18.011 --> 01:53:19.192]  The fact is you are.
[01:53:19.392 --> 01:53:20.173]  We all are.
[01:53:20.433 --> 01:53:22.755]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.

[01:54:01.426 --> 01:54:16.937]  Okay, if you go to DrudgeReport.com, there's a daily mail article about Misha, the supposed redhead guy that nobody could find for a week.
[01:54:27.224 --> 01:54:35.266]  Uh, who reportedly said it was all Alex Jones's, you know, fault that the guys basically did what they did, and that no one could say who actually talked to him in the Associated Press.
[01:54:35.887 --> 01:54:44.549]  And Curt Nemo put an article out today at Infowars.com saying nobody can find him, uh, and saying, you know, this looks like a perfect cutout to make this up and demonize the internet.
[01:54:45.109 --> 01:54:47.930]  Well, sure enough, the Daily Mail did find him in Rhode Island.
[01:54:48.965 --> 01:54:49.326]  I don't
[01:55:03.865 --> 01:55:04.966]  Well now, he's been found.
[01:55:05.006 --> 01:55:05.486]  DailyMail.
[01:55:05.506 --> 01:55:06.206]  DrudgeReport.com.
[01:55:06.226 --> 01:55:07.247]  Right hand side.
[01:55:07.327 --> 01:55:08.708]  We need to add that to this article.
[01:55:08.868 --> 01:55:10.769]  And it just adds to what Kurt was saying.
[01:55:10.789 --> 01:55:11.090]  So, there you go.
[01:55:11.110 --> 01:55:12.691]  That story's been on Drudge since this morning.
[01:55:27.688 --> 01:55:34.933]  Okay, going back to our guest in this little segment, the next, Gerald Cilente, is coming in.
[01:55:37.455 --> 01:55:43.980]  William F. Jasper of the New American Magazine, again, whether you were getting into being at these globalist meetings and how they operate, go ahead.
[01:55:44.641 --> 01:55:53.267]  Well, one of the very important ones where we see this convergence going on, this is a very important term that
[01:55:53.907 --> 01:56:08.844]  I'm sure many of your listeners are familiar with, but they should be more and more familiar with, is convergence, where this was the plan after World War II was first to build up the communist countries, the Hegelian dialectic, where they would be a credible force against the free world.
[01:56:09.404 --> 01:56:12.868]  And then to have a, well, we can't have this constant
[01:56:14.142 --> 01:56:14.763]  We're good to go.
[01:56:35.122 --> 01:56:41.387]  Now we can merge, converge peacefully with the communist countries, with China, Russia, etc.
[01:56:42.048 --> 01:56:46.631]  And I was at one of these, I've been at a number of the big convergence conferences.
[01:56:46.711 --> 01:56:50.394]  One of the big venues for this is Gorbachev's State of the World Forum.
[01:56:51.054 --> 01:56:53.615]  Which I've been at virtually all of them.
[01:56:54.135 --> 01:57:01.038]  One of the big ones was in San Francisco in 1995, the 50th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations in San Francisco.
[01:57:01.499 --> 01:57:08.161]  Gorbachev was there, had Ted Turner, Zbigniew Brzezinski, all of the big names from around the world there.
[01:57:08.642 --> 01:57:13.864]  And Zbigniew Brzezinski made his speech, which I reported on from there, and we recorded it.
[01:57:14.664 --> 01:57:20.450]  That's where he made his famous statement that we cannot leap into world government in one step.
[01:57:20.870 --> 01:57:28.358]  It has to occur through gradual, step-by-step regional developments.
[01:57:29.078 --> 01:57:37.667]  And this, of course, is a restatement of what a number of other key New World Order architects have stated, which we've reported on.
[01:57:38.127 --> 01:57:49.513]  Which is that we have to have these regional arrangements which destroy the national sovereignty by linking country to country and region to region.
[01:57:49.994 --> 01:57:57.518]  And that's what we see happening through many of the different economic, security, military
[01:57:58.278 --> 01:57:58.919]  I don't think so.
[01:58:08.465 --> 01:58:13.950]  Actually building the United Nations into one globalized central government.
[01:58:13.970 --> 01:58:15.611]  So they had to do it piecemeal.
[01:58:15.671 --> 01:58:24.259]  And so that's what we see happening here with the trade agreements, with environmental agreements, with now the security agreements.
[01:58:24.419 --> 01:58:33.146]  But they all cede authority to unelected corporate boards who can even exempt themselves from taxes and give themselves government contracts and too big to fail money.
[01:58:33.206 --> 01:58:33.847]  It is incredible.
[01:58:34.207 --> 01:58:38.769]  Five more minutes with William F. Jasper from the New American Magazine, then Gerald Celente, host.
[01:58:41.090 --> 01:58:42.970]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:44.591 --> 01:58:46.672]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.549 --> 01:58:53.292]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[01:58:53.572 --> 01:58:58.397]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:58:58.597 --> 01:59:05.765]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[01:59:05.885 --> 01:59:11.309]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[01:59:11.529 --> 01:59:15.272]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[01:59:15.552 --> 01:59:20.076]  You've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[01:59:20.276 --> 01:59:25.500]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[01:59:25.740 --> 01:59:28.821]  Strategic Relocation 3rd Edition by Joel Skousen.
[01:59:28.981 --> 01:59:31.241]  When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.
[01:59:31.481 --> 01:59:36.062]  Therosafe used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[01:59:36.242 --> 01:59:38.703]  Hand Crank Shortwave AM FM Radios.
[01:59:39.123 --> 01:59:46.164]  Everything that we've researched and found to be the best is available at InfoWarshop.com and your purchase makes our Info War possible.
[01:59:46.324 --> 01:59:47.364]  We're getting prepared.
[01:59:47.604 --> 01:59:48.005]  Are you?
[01:59:48.265 --> 01:59:49.365]  InfoWarshop.com
[01:59:53.450 --> 01:59:55.391]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:55.851 --> 01:59:58.713]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:04.676 --> 02:00:05.337]  Big Brother.
[02:00:05.997 --> 02:00:07.038]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:07.758 --> 02:00:09.019]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:09.519 --> 02:00:10.340]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.100 --> 02:00:12.060]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.661 --> 02:00:16.283]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:16.843 --> 02:00:20.925]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:26.980 --> 02:00:29.821]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the final segment I'm going to be hosting.
[02:00:29.861 --> 02:00:34.863]  I'm going to bring you in with Gerald Cilente in the next segment and introduce him for stations that join us.
[02:00:35.303 --> 02:00:37.904]  Most stations carry all three hours, but some only carry the third hour.
[02:00:38.724 --> 02:00:40.205]  Right now, William F. Jasper joins us.
[02:00:40.225 --> 02:00:42.886]  Hey, just briefly before you finish your points, this is only a five-minute segment.
[02:00:43.326 --> 02:00:45.287]  How do people subscribe to the New American Magazine?
[02:00:45.307 --> 02:00:51.329]  Because even if you think you know everything about this, you will learn a lot there every month, and it's meticulously researched.
[02:00:52.150 --> 02:00:57.161]  Uh, and at the same time, people can then pay it forward, hand it off to other people.
[02:00:57.221 --> 02:01:01.531]  I mean, that's, I cannot understate, overstate.
[02:01:03.311 --> 02:01:07.554]  Anything I say is an understatement of the entire movement against the globalists.
[02:01:07.574 --> 02:01:15.859]  The original battle prospectus breakdown on their plan is from Mr. Welsh and you over the last 37 years and others.
[02:01:16.499 --> 02:01:22.864]  Mr. McManus, I mean, it's such a small group too, and absolutely demonized, but knowing you're right,
[02:01:23.884 --> 02:01:29.391]  And they're probably 10 to 15 years behind their own documents, so God bless you.
[02:01:29.411 --> 02:01:33.095]  I salute everybody that's been fighting the globalists.
[02:01:33.135 --> 02:01:35.377]  Jim Tucker, American Free Press, just died.
[02:01:35.397 --> 02:01:36.499]  He helped fight them as well.
[02:01:38.661 --> 02:01:39.882]  Where do you see the future going?
[02:02:00.569 --> 02:02:07.295]  Both the print magazine, which you mentioned, and it's actually bi-weekly, and so 25 issues a year.
[02:02:07.355 --> 02:02:09.817]  We take a break one week, so it's 25 issues.
[02:02:10.237 --> 02:02:19.145]  It's $39 for the print, or for $49 you get the print and you can get it via email and PDF form as well.
[02:02:20.098 --> 02:02:22.959]  And there's a lot of exclusive stuff in the print magazine.
[02:02:24.600 --> 02:02:35.303]  While many of the major print magazines have folded or gone under in major newspapers, we're still holding in there doing the actual hard copy print magazine.
[02:02:35.363 --> 02:02:38.704]  Please don't stop because people really pay attention to hard copy.
[02:02:39.064 --> 02:02:40.185]  People really pay attention.
[02:02:41.445 --> 02:02:53.433]  I have to stress also that the online edition, we have 10 to 15 new articles a day that are going to be appearing in the print magazine.
[02:02:53.473 --> 02:03:00.377]  So there's some material that we include in both, but there's exclusive material online and in print.
[02:03:01.137 --> 02:03:03.899]  And now I see you guys linked up on the Drudge Report.
[02:03:03.939 --> 02:03:05.140]  The New World Order's got to hate that.
[02:03:05.840 --> 02:03:23.150]  Yes, well, this is one of the encouraging things, Alex, and that is that as it gets later and later in the game, as the lines begin to be drawn here and people see, hey, wait a second, we're losing freedom every step of the way here.
[02:03:24.711 --> 02:03:26.532]  Let's find out about it.
[02:03:26.572 --> 02:03:27.992]  More and more people are waking up.
[02:03:28.372 --> 02:03:35.836]  The big question is, are we going to wake up enough people in enough time and get them getting us all shooting in the right direction?
[02:03:36.877 --> 02:03:37.717]  Figuratively, of course.
[02:03:39.383 --> 02:03:41.444]  But I think we're going to win if everybody takes action.
[02:03:41.544 --> 02:03:44.264]  I mean, I really see us more and more gaining ground.
[02:03:44.724 --> 02:03:54.987]  Well, one of the things you mentioned is that there's so much happening, they're speeding up this whole thing on a lot of different levels, and that is true.
[02:03:55.007 --> 02:03:57.068]  And I see part of it as desperation.
[02:03:58.268 --> 02:04:14.195]  In fact, we've published a number of things showing that many of the people that are pushing this in Congress, but also in the think tanks at places like the Council on Foreign Relations and whatnot, they are saying amongst themselves, hey, we can't let the crazy people out there know what's going on.
[02:04:14.515 --> 02:04:15.876]  We can't let the American people know.
[02:04:15.936 --> 02:04:18.977]  They'll all go berserk over this.
[02:04:19.817 --> 02:04:39.025]  And so at venues like the World Economic Forum and other high-globalist meeting places like this, they are acknowledging that, hey, we've got to step things up here, we've got to be more deceptive, we've got to undermine opposition within the political party.
[02:04:39.045 --> 02:04:41.446]  And that's what they're doing, and it's only backfiring.
[02:04:41.466 --> 02:04:43.587]  William F. Jasper, thanks for spending an hour with us.
[02:04:43.607 --> 02:04:47.509]  I look forward to having you and other folks that you recommend on the broadcast.
[02:04:47.529 --> 02:04:47.909]  Thank you, sir.
[02:04:49.679 --> 02:04:56.157]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, the man, Gerald Salente, directly from Kingston, New York, is coming up straight ahead.
[02:04:56.197 --> 02:04:57.440]  He'll be hosting the broadcast.
[02:05:02.125 --> 02:05:09.812]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal Ben Soap Company.
[02:05:10.252 --> 02:05:13.876]  Alex and his staff have used these pure soap products for years.
[02:05:14.316 --> 02:05:21.142]  These all-natural soaps are made from the highest quality vegetable and coconut oils that are earth-friendly and safe.

[02:05:35.412 --> 02:05:40.516]  Or save big with a 1 to 2 year supply of soaps for all your cleaning needs.
[02:05:40.816 --> 02:05:42.457]  This is an amazing deal.
[02:05:42.817 --> 02:05:47.440]  You can save thousands of dollars and you will love the way real soap makes you feel.
[02:05:48.041 --> 02:05:51.123]  See them on the web at 5starsoap.com or call
[02:05:51.423 --> 02:05:52.891]  Call 800-340-7091 for a free catalog.
[02:06:00.427 --> 02:06:03.489]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms.
[02:06:03.830 --> 02:06:09.293]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[02:06:09.874 --> 02:06:13.076]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?
[02:06:13.777 --> 02:06:15.038]  Check out SimpliSafe.
[02:06:15.358 --> 02:06:19.221]  It's a new do-it-yourself home security system that is completely wireless.

[02:06:57.073 --> 02:06:59.255]  Again, that's GetSimplySafe.com.
[02:07:00.035 --> 02:07:01.956]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[02:07:01.976 --> 02:07:04.237]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[02:07:04.378 --> 02:07:09.641]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[02:07:09.861 --> 02:07:13.643]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[02:07:13.903 --> 02:07:17.665]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[02:07:17.825 --> 02:07:19.026]  The fact is, you are.
[02:07:19.226 --> 02:07:20.006]  We all are.
[02:07:20.247 --> 02:07:22.568]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[02:07:22.888 --> 02:07:31.236]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoodsDirect.
[02:07:31.436 --> 02:07:32.657]  Be prepared before you need it.
[02:07:32.837 --> 02:07:36.020]  With nutrient-dense food you can store for up to 25 years.
[02:07:36.300 --> 02:07:38.562]  You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed you.
[02:07:38.702 --> 02:07:43.126]  Do what I've done and get your own supply of the best storable foods out there from eFoodsDirect.
[02:07:43.247 --> 02:07:49.152]  Call 800-409-5633 or visit them on the web at efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:07:49.392 --> 02:07:50.813]  And check out their spring specials.
[02:07:51.033 --> 02:07:52.273]  Again, that number is 800-409-5633.
[02:07:52.333 --> 02:07:57.316]  Or on the web at efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:07:57.556 --> 02:07:59.516]  You can bet your life on eFoods Direct.
[02:08:03.858 --> 02:08:05.379]  We are on the march.
[02:08:05.719 --> 02:08:08.160]  The empire is on the run.
[02:08:08.881 --> 02:08:12.662]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:12.682 --> 02:08:16.484]  You look good.
[02:08:17.950 --> 02:08:27.303]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I'm coming to you from Hot Springs, Arkansas, spending a few days with the family, but also hosting part of the broadcast with Jakari Jackson, David Niner, our guest.
[02:08:28.044 --> 02:08:31.849]  But in the next 52 minutes, you're going to have the real treat of Gerald Salente.
[02:08:33.070 --> 02:08:41.855]  Taking over the broadcast and covering a host of issues in the last minute or so, Jakari Jackson will end the transmission until tonight's InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:08:41.915 --> 02:08:53.761]  But out the window, if you're watching on PrisonPlanet.tv, the nightly news, you can see the Army-Navy Rehabilitation Center, part of which is still open here with the volcanic hot water baths.
[02:08:53.801 --> 02:08:56.222]  This town is basically rotting back into the hills.
[02:08:56.903 --> 02:08:58.604]  Once a vibrant place, but it's still one of the
[02:08:59.184 --> 02:09:03.227]  Best places in America to visit, so we can keep Hot Springs, Arkansas alive.
[02:09:03.247 --> 02:09:09.512]  I've been coming here since I was a small child, and I'm here with family now for a few days, but we're coming back to Austin today, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:09:10.273 --> 02:09:17.418]  But again, I am here in Hot Springs, Arkansas, and there is a shot via Skype out the window of that.
[02:09:17.458 --> 02:09:21.041]  I'm going to turn things over to Gerald Cilente of TheTrendsJournal.com.
[02:09:21.381 --> 02:09:26.245]  He's going to be covering Syria, White House Correspondents Dinner, Bush Library, Italian government.
[02:09:26.925 --> 02:09:28.867]  He's also going to get into the Boston bombing, China.
[02:09:29.307 --> 02:09:32.109]  And positive measures to return prosperity to America.
[02:09:32.429 --> 02:09:38.633]  So we turn the InfoWars worldwide broadcast over to the top trends forecaster, Gerald Cilente.
[02:09:38.953 --> 02:09:41.415]  Gerald, again my friend, I want to thank you for joining us.
[02:09:42.075 --> 02:09:44.497]  And the helm, the comm, is now yours, Captain.
[02:09:45.157 --> 02:09:46.338]  Well, thank you so much.
[02:09:46.398 --> 02:09:49.040]  It's a real honor for me to be here today, Alex.
[02:09:49.560 --> 02:09:55.745]  And what I'd like to do during this segment is really what we do every day on Trends in the News.
[02:09:55.825 --> 02:10:00.829]  It's part of the subscription to the Trends Journal, and they're nightly broadcasts.
[02:10:00.889 --> 02:10:07.314]  Of course, they're not as long as the one I'm going to do now, but they average anywhere between 15 to 20 minutes.
[02:10:08.795 --> 02:10:12.538]  So let's start off with today's trends in the news.
[02:10:13.238 --> 02:10:20.564]  And the first one, one of the ones you just mentioned, is that White House Correspondents Dinner.
[02:10:21.024 --> 02:10:26.949]  You know, I was just listening to William Jasper of New American Magazine.
[02:10:27.549 --> 02:10:32.170]  And you, Alex, saying that, yes, we can change this.
[02:10:32.831 --> 02:10:34.291]  It can be changed.
[02:10:34.671 --> 02:10:37.152]  We don't have to go down this course.
[02:10:37.612 --> 02:10:46.895]  And if you don't believe me, look at the White House Correspondents Dinner and how lame it is.
[02:10:47.315 --> 02:10:51.236]  And you think you're in a high school assembly.
[02:10:51.516 --> 02:10:53.457]  Just listen to some of this stuff.
[02:10:55.592 --> 02:10:57.833]  I recognize that this job can take a toll on you.
[02:10:58.793 --> 02:11:08.956]  I understand, second term, you need a burst of new energy, try some new things, and then my team and I talked about it, we were willing to try anything, so we borrowed one of Michelle's tricks.
[02:11:15.498 --> 02:11:17.899]  Listen to the prostitutes!
[02:11:22.196 --> 02:11:22.777]  That's enough.
[02:11:23.257 --> 02:11:23.877]  That's enough.
[02:11:24.598 --> 02:11:26.640]  Then you hear Conan O'Brien.
[02:11:26.880 --> 02:11:31.043]  You listen to the prostitutes clap on cue.
[02:11:31.584 --> 02:11:33.045]  It's disgusting.
[02:11:33.606 --> 02:11:38.109]  And what's more disgusting is how anybody could look up to this stuff.
[02:11:38.510 --> 02:11:40.932]  And you look at all the media that came out.
[02:11:41.112 --> 02:11:44.675]  Oh, Obama hit him with a one-two punch.
[02:11:45.115 --> 02:11:46.957]  Oh, Conan was fabulous.
[02:11:47.397 --> 02:11:50.320]  The guys are reading like this from their notes.
[02:11:50.740 --> 02:11:53.162]  And all the prostitutes laugh.
[02:11:53.562 --> 02:12:00.748]  It's a disgraceful spectacle of human beings acting at the lowest level.
[02:12:01.069 --> 02:12:04.932]  So you take this information, and this is what you're fighting.
[02:12:05.412 --> 02:12:07.054]  This is what you're up against.
[02:12:07.274 --> 02:12:08.675]  You're up against nothing.
[02:12:08.975 --> 02:12:10.597]  You've heard me say this before.
[02:12:10.897 --> 02:12:11.798]  I'll say it again.
[02:12:12.618 --> 02:12:22.910]  All these politicians are, are the same people you couldn't stand in high school and college that wanted to be class president and head of the student council.
[02:12:23.250 --> 02:12:29.277]  The suck-ups, the brown noses, the glad handers, the overly ambitious and the insincere.
[02:12:29.677 --> 02:12:30.978]  And who are the prostitutes?
[02:12:31.378 --> 02:12:36.661]  The same clowns that were the journalists that ran the school newspapers.
[02:12:37.001 --> 02:12:44.006]  It's like they're talking to the principal of the school or the president of the college when they interview the president.
[02:12:44.366 --> 02:12:50.810]  So when I listen to Mr. Jasper, when I listen to Alex Jones, the future is ours!
[02:12:51.798 --> 02:12:54.261]  Unless you think they're better than you are.
[02:12:54.921 --> 02:12:56.583]  So to me it's very hopeful.
[02:12:56.863 --> 02:13:01.068]  You look at these clown acts, amateur hour for what it is.
[02:13:02.309 --> 02:13:03.170]  Let's move on.
[02:13:03.290 --> 02:13:03.731]  Gold.
[02:13:05.472 --> 02:13:07.415]  Gold prices are up a little bit today.
[02:13:08.922 --> 02:13:12.685]  And they were up about 12% since when they bottomed out a few weeks ago.
[02:13:13.606 --> 02:13:16.928]  And I've said this before for those of you who haven't heard it before.
[02:13:17.489 --> 02:13:19.410]  My first buy of gold was in 1978 at $187.50 an ounce.
[02:13:19.450 --> 02:13:22.132]  I also bought gold on January 20th, 1980 at the high during the day at $8.75.
[02:13:22.172 --> 02:13:22.592]  It closed at $8.50.
[02:13:35.562 --> 02:13:40.064]  I remember what it felt like back then when the market was diving.
[02:13:40.584 --> 02:13:42.785]  Very different sentiment now.
[02:13:43.165 --> 02:13:44.685]  Back then there was no Russia.
[02:13:45.366 --> 02:13:47.046]  Back then there was no China.
[02:13:47.686 --> 02:13:49.567]  Russia was a Soviet Union.
[02:13:49.947 --> 02:13:53.168]  Everything east of Berlin was locked behind the Iron Curtain.
[02:13:53.488 --> 02:13:56.970]  The only thing people knew back then about China was Mao.
[02:13:57.990 --> 02:13:58.450]  India?
[02:13:59.350 --> 02:14:00.711]  They do nothing about India.
[02:14:01.191 --> 02:14:03.191]  It's a global world now.
[02:14:03.691 --> 02:14:17.075]  You're seeing the people rushing in to buy gold as the prices are dropping because everyone knows that you cannot keep juicing the economy by printing more money.
[02:14:18.115 --> 02:14:19.796]  So look at the news today.
[02:14:19.816 --> 02:14:25.117]  Oh, on May 2nd, they're going to meet over there in the European Central Bank.
[02:14:26.158 --> 02:14:28.119]  And they're going to be lowering interest rates.
[02:14:28.359 --> 02:14:32.981]  That's the word coming out from the experts.
[02:14:34.001 --> 02:14:35.862]  And then you look what's going on.
[02:14:36.603 --> 02:14:40.024]  Why is the market even going up a little bit today?
[02:14:40.784 --> 02:14:42.385]  Read the information.
[02:14:42.805 --> 02:14:44.006]  They'll tell you why.
[02:14:44.026 --> 02:14:46.187]  It's Bloomberg.
[02:14:47.335 --> 02:15:03.154]  There's just a positive tone to the market, in part because recent lackluster economic trends have reinforced investors' belief that the Federal Reserve will continue to press on the gas pedal.
[02:15:03.174 --> 02:15:07.058]  And that's from Chad Morganlander.
[02:15:08.146 --> 02:15:12.010]  And his firm, they oversee $130 billion.
[02:15:12.330 --> 02:15:14.632]  Gas on the pedal!
[02:15:14.652 --> 02:15:16.895]  You know what kind of language that is?
[02:15:17.255 --> 02:15:27.064]  I can't say this on this show, but the first letter is B, and the second letter is S, in saying the two words, because that's what that is.
[02:15:27.665 --> 02:15:28.706]  Gas to the pedal?
[02:15:29.126 --> 02:15:29.507]  No!
[02:15:29.907 --> 02:15:36.052]  It's pumping more worthless money into the economy and devaluing the currency.
[02:15:36.392 --> 02:15:42.377]  And it's going on globally, and that's why I believe in gold.
[02:15:43.652 --> 02:15:45.414]  Let's look at some of the headlines.
[02:15:45.854 --> 02:16:05.055]  This is from the New York Times, the self-proclaimed paper of record, of which I like to call it the toilet paper of record, considering the wonderful job they've done to take us to war for fake reasons and to keep propping up the lies and keeping the propaganda going.
[02:16:06.087 --> 02:16:07.048]  This is a great one.
[02:16:07.408 --> 02:16:12.232]  Karzai's office gets bags full of cash from the CIA.
[02:16:13.013 --> 02:16:16.356]  A decade of paying for Afghan influence.
[02:16:17.076 --> 02:16:18.197]  Can you imagine that?
[02:16:18.578 --> 02:16:19.699]  Don't have a job?
[02:16:19.759 --> 02:16:21.100]  The one you have stinks?
[02:16:21.680 --> 02:16:22.941]  Can't pay your mortgage?
[02:16:23.021 --> 02:16:24.262]  Don't have any rent money?
[02:16:25.023 --> 02:16:26.304]  Can't make ends meet.
[02:16:26.644 --> 02:16:27.866]  Don't worry about it.
[02:16:28.246 --> 02:16:30.568]  It's all outlined here.
[02:16:31.148 --> 02:16:38.935]  We call it ghost money, said Khalil Roman, who served as Mr. Karzai's chief of staff from 2002 to 2005.
[02:16:42.438 --> 02:16:45.339]  It came in secret and left in secret.
[02:16:45.879 --> 02:16:48.580]  All told, tens of millions of dollars.
[02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:51.621]  And it goes on and on and on.
[02:16:52.021 --> 02:16:55.022]  How this scam, the CIA's money?
[02:16:55.762 --> 02:16:56.823]  It's your money.
[02:16:57.203 --> 02:16:58.763]  Hey, cities are rotting.
[02:16:59.164 --> 02:17:02.225]  Alex is talking about how run-down Little Rock looks.
[02:17:02.605 --> 02:17:03.785]  Don't worry about it.
[02:17:04.145 --> 02:17:09.067]  We gotta send the money over there to the criminal group so that they could wash it.
[02:17:09.807 --> 02:17:11.470]  And keep the wars going.
[02:17:11.991 --> 02:17:16.600]  You read the quotes in this paper, it is astounding the things they say.
[02:17:17.489 --> 02:17:17.729]  Yeah.
[02:17:18.390 --> 02:17:21.491]  CIA's money goes to paying off warlords.
[02:17:21.931 --> 02:17:23.532]  Nothing like a warlord!
[02:17:23.873 --> 02:17:24.833]  Oh, they're wonderful.
[02:17:25.113 --> 02:17:35.039]  You need a good warlord in your community, and politicians, many of whom have ties to the drug trade, and in some cases, the Taliban!
[02:17:35.359 --> 02:17:36.079]  Yeah, wonderful!
[02:17:36.459 --> 02:17:38.621]  Go back to the Correspondents' Dinner.
[02:17:39.061 --> 02:17:40.602]  Look who's running this country.
[02:17:41.062 --> 02:17:42.863]  Look who's making these decisions.
[02:17:43.203 --> 02:17:48.904]  If you were right to do anything like this so stupid in our jobs, we would be fired.
[02:17:49.324 --> 02:17:52.785]  But it's okay when the government does it.
[02:17:53.385 --> 02:17:55.505]  The headlines here are astounding.
[02:17:55.846 --> 02:18:00.566]  The cash does not appear to be subject to oversight and restrictions.
[02:18:01.107 --> 02:18:01.587]  No!
[02:18:01.767 --> 02:18:03.007]  Hey, it's their money!
[02:18:03.327 --> 02:18:04.607]  The CIA's money!
[02:18:04.667 --> 02:18:05.607]  Where did they get it?
[02:18:05.848 --> 02:18:07.048]  They got it from you!
[02:18:08.533 --> 02:18:10.735]  This is where your tax dollars are going.
[02:18:11.175 --> 02:18:13.197]  No more foreign intervention.
[02:18:13.557 --> 02:18:16.159]  Everything they do, there's a loser.
[02:18:16.499 --> 02:18:25.707]  And you can't see a bigger loser than right over here on the front page of the toilet paper of record.
[02:18:27.108 --> 02:18:29.710]  So that's where it's all going.
[02:18:29.770 --> 02:18:30.971]  That's where it's heading.
[02:18:31.551 --> 02:18:33.393]  And it doesn't look very good.
[02:18:34.714 --> 02:18:36.215]  Yeah, these quotes are brilliant.
[02:18:37.256 --> 02:18:37.436]  Huh.
[02:18:38.345 --> 02:18:41.847]  Much of it also goes to keeping old warlords in line.
[02:18:42.267 --> 02:18:43.408]  Check this line out.
[02:18:43.748 --> 02:18:47.490]  This is from an old warlord, Mr. Dostrum.
[02:18:48.290 --> 02:18:52.852]  I asked for a year up front in cash so I could build my dream house.
[02:18:53.253 --> 02:19:00.737]  He was quoted as saying in a 2009 interview in Time Magazine.
[02:19:01.237 --> 02:19:01.937]  That's right.
[02:19:02.337 --> 02:19:03.798]  He gets his $100,000 up front, piles it up,
[02:19:07.660 --> 02:19:10.241]  So he could build a home of his choice.
[02:19:10.761 --> 02:19:19.004]  So this is what we do on Trends in the News, because as we're talking about foreign affairs, here's another wonderful little story.
[02:19:19.525 --> 02:19:23.406]  Republicans warn of inaction on Syria.
[02:19:24.106 --> 02:19:24.887]  Oh, yeah.
[02:19:25.387 --> 02:19:26.467]  That guy again.
[02:19:26.967 --> 02:19:28.228]  That little chicken hawk.
[02:19:28.548 --> 02:19:29.028]  You know.
[02:19:29.048 --> 02:19:31.869]  Lindsey Graham.
[02:19:32.570 --> 02:19:32.890]  Yeah.
[02:19:34.141 --> 02:19:35.902]  Calling for more war.
[02:19:36.923 --> 02:19:39.585]  More war in Syria.
[02:19:39.945 --> 02:19:41.587]  Messed up in Afghanistan?
[02:19:41.987 --> 02:19:43.028]  Iraq's a bust?
[02:19:43.688 --> 02:19:45.069]  Libya down the tubes?
[02:19:45.489 --> 02:19:47.151]  Let's go into Syria!
[02:20:00.145 --> 02:20:02.085]  Hey there, my name is Frank Bates.
[02:20:02.546 --> 02:20:05.246]  Do you know the number one most valuable item in a crisis?
[02:20:05.826 --> 02:20:07.587]  Some people think the answer is gold.
[02:20:08.007 --> 02:20:09.247]  Others think it's a gun.
[02:20:09.607 --> 02:20:11.448]  But the correct answer will shock you.
[02:20:11.988 --> 02:20:19.790]  I just created a free video at Crisis123.com that reveals a surprising item that is more valuable than gold in a crisis.
[02:20:20.851 --> 02:20:23.914]  97% of Americans don't have this one critical item.
[02:20:24.214 --> 02:20:26.036]  In fact, they haven't even given it a thought.
[02:20:26.356 --> 02:20:33.343]  And the sad truth is that you may not survive without it when a real crisis hits and a starving mob is right outside your door.
[02:20:33.844 --> 02:20:38.349]  What I have to tell you could literally make the difference between life and death for you and your family.
[02:20:38.829 --> 02:20:44.754]  Watch my video at Crisis123.com to discover the number one most valuable item in a crisis.
[02:20:45.054 --> 02:20:45.835]  You'll be shocked.
[02:20:46.416 --> 02:20:51.120]  See the controversial video that thousands of other smart patrons have already seen in the last three months.
[02:20:51.620 --> 02:20:56.704]  Go watch my video now at Crisis123.com before they force me to shut it down.
[02:20:57.105 --> 02:20:59.587]  Again, that's Crisis123.com.
[02:21:00.147 --> 02:21:01.008]  Start life over.
[02:21:01.368 --> 02:21:03.190]  Spend more quality time with your family.
[02:21:03.450 --> 02:21:04.531]  Take more vacations.
[02:21:04.911 --> 02:21:05.891]  Own your own business.
[02:21:06.232 --> 02:21:09.553]  Be healthy and earn the kind of income you've always dreamed of.
[02:21:09.934 --> 02:21:10.634]  Is it possible?
[02:21:11.014 --> 02:21:12.535]  Yes, with Young-Jevity.

[02:21:31.727 --> 02:21:35.630]  Hi, this is pharmacist Ben Fuchs, and I'm taking the Healthy Body Challenge, and I will be there.

[02:22:30.488 --> 02:22:34.891]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:22:35.071 --> 02:22:40.775]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:22:40.875 --> 02:22:44.277]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[02:24:01.399 --> 02:24:06.543]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:07.224 --> 02:24:09.526]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:24:11.561 --> 02:24:11.603]  No.
[02:24:14.815 --> 02:24:20.217]  Hi, this is Gerald Cilenti, hosting on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:20.257 --> 02:24:21.457]  An honor to be here.
[02:24:22.118 --> 02:24:27.020]  As I was talking about Syria when we went into the break, don't worry about it.
[02:24:27.660 --> 02:24:33.822]  The New York Times just reported, hey, them Islamists are taking over there in Syria.
[02:24:34.202 --> 02:24:35.263]  That's OK.
[02:24:35.643 --> 02:24:36.883]  They're everywhere.
[02:24:37.543 --> 02:24:40.365]  And you know who built the Islamist group, don't you?
[02:24:40.925 --> 02:24:42.685]  That was Jimmy Carter.
[02:24:42.705 --> 02:24:42.785]  Yeah.
[02:24:44.426 --> 02:25:00.918]  You remember the proxy war that the United States started giving money to people like Osama Bin Laden and all the rest of them to fight the Russians when they were going into Afghanistan to stop the Russians?
[02:25:01.058 --> 02:25:01.358]  Yeah!
[02:25:02.279 --> 02:25:03.480]  Those Islamists.
[02:25:03.900 --> 02:25:06.040]  So now they want more money.
[02:25:06.721 --> 02:25:08.681]  They want more intervention.
[02:25:08.762 --> 02:25:19.986]  People like Lindsey Graham calling for more action in Syria because it appears they're all suffering from attention deficit disorder.
[02:25:21.229 --> 02:25:28.633]  Classes, clashes carry worries of a new civil war in Iraq.
[02:25:29.093 --> 02:25:32.755]  That's right, a new civil war in Iraq.
[02:25:33.215 --> 02:25:34.876]  That's the word coming out.
[02:25:35.950 --> 02:25:38.631]  But hey, why believe me?
[02:25:39.191 --> 02:25:40.231]  Look at the papers.
[02:25:40.991 --> 02:25:44.172]  Oh, 11 dead and another car bomb in Iraq.
[02:25:44.832 --> 02:25:45.773]  Wonderful!
[02:25:46.473 --> 02:25:54.955]  Yeah, but listen to what happened over when President Bush announced the opening of his new library.
[02:25:55.515 --> 02:26:02.340]  You know, President Obama said that he's drawing a red line that Syria can't cross.
[02:26:02.940 --> 02:26:08.003]  I wonder if he got the crayon from Bush to draw that red line.
[02:26:09.705 --> 02:26:12.046]  I love the language that they use.
[02:26:12.626 --> 02:26:14.107]  We're taking this off the table.
[02:26:14.348 --> 02:26:17.109]  That's the other lovely one they use.
[02:26:17.129 --> 02:26:20.312]  We're taking it all off the table and we're drawing a red line.
[02:26:20.832 --> 02:26:24.735]  Islamist rebels create dilemma on Syria policy.
[02:26:25.815 --> 02:26:35.982]  Nowhere in rebel-controlled Syria is there a secular fighting force to speak of, and this is from the toilet paper of record.
[02:26:36.923 --> 02:26:44.969]  So, following going back to how they keep screwing up and getting more opportunities to do so,
[02:26:46.704 --> 02:26:48.986]  Karl Rove, you remember him?
[02:26:49.006 --> 02:26:55.690]  That was Bush's front man, back man, side man, and man behind the scenes.
[02:26:55.770 --> 02:27:00.353]  Yeah, the porky pig of politics, Karl Rove.
[02:27:00.994 --> 02:27:03.735]  Yeah, Karl Rove on Bush legacy.
[02:27:04.816 --> 02:27:06.437]  He got the big things right.
[02:27:08.058 --> 02:27:14.383]  I do believe that the Iraq War was the right thing to do, and the world is a safer place
[02:27:15.725 --> 02:27:19.007]  For having Saddam Hussein gone.
[02:27:19.427 --> 02:27:20.888]  Don't you all feel happy?
[02:27:21.309 --> 02:27:22.610]  Don't you feel safe?
[02:27:23.090 --> 02:27:24.291]  Having a nice day?
[02:27:24.691 --> 02:27:26.973]  Who cares about Saddam Hussein?
[02:27:27.793 --> 02:27:40.181]  What a big lie, and how come these guys aren't brought up on war criminal charges to see who knew what when regarding WMD's weapons and mass destruction.
[02:27:40.602 --> 02:27:41.783]  So Bush was
[02:27:42.703 --> 02:27:49.004]  Interviewed by all of the prostitutes on all of the channels from the mainstream media.
[02:27:49.304 --> 02:27:51.344]  And they all sucked up.
[02:27:51.965 --> 02:27:59.846]  And all Bush kept saying, and all the mouthpieces are saying, is, let's let history decide.
[02:28:00.306 --> 02:28:04.067]  Oh yeah, let history decide if Bush messed up or not.
[02:28:04.747 --> 02:28:06.287]  Why let history decide?
[02:28:06.607 --> 02:28:08.727]  Let's decide now with the facts.
[02:28:09.148 --> 02:28:11.628]  I'll tell you why they want history to decide.
[02:28:12.844 --> 02:28:19.045]  Here he goes, the Porky Pig of Politics, Karl Rove!
[02:28:20.566 --> 02:28:21.526]  The greats, you know.
[02:28:21.546 --> 02:28:25.987]  You can't touch George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, FDR, the greats.
[02:28:26.347 --> 02:28:36.309]  But yeah, I'd put George Bush up there, says Rove, who refers to a recent ABC Washington Post poll that found 40% approve of Bush.
[02:28:39.585 --> 02:28:46.549]  As evidence that he will continue to be remembered more keenly as time goes by.
[02:28:46.569 --> 02:28:55.874]  He'll be remembered more keenly as time goes by because everybody will forget what a screw-up he was.
[02:28:56.214 --> 02:28:59.796]  He didn't even show up on Inauguration Day!
[02:28:59.816 --> 02:29:03.238]  That's right, that's how much the people hated him.
[02:29:03.558 --> 02:29:04.619]  They booed him!
[02:29:05.259 --> 02:29:06.259]  They booed him.
[02:29:06.279 --> 02:29:07.960]  No, it was Cheney that didn't show up.
[02:29:08.240 --> 02:29:11.440]  They booed Bush when he showed up with Obama.
[02:29:12.220 --> 02:29:16.081]  That, they never booed a president, a leaving president before.
[02:29:16.621 --> 02:29:21.182]  Mussolini could have got elected after having eight years of Bush.
[02:29:21.702 --> 02:29:22.563]  And guess what?
[02:29:23.083 --> 02:29:23.863]  We got him.
[02:29:24.323 --> 02:29:25.183]  Fascism.
[02:29:26.443 --> 02:29:29.104]  The merger of state and corporate powers.
[02:29:30.185 --> 02:29:34.926]  And we're going to look at more of that when we come back with Trends in the News.
[02:29:34.946 --> 02:29:42.868]  And we're going to see why China is going to out-beat the United States as we keep going down.
[02:29:43.288 --> 02:29:46.409]  But there are other ways to go up and we'll talk about those too.
[02:29:46.629 --> 02:29:49.289]  This is Gerald Slunting on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:29:49.309 --> 02:29:50.130]  We're on the march.
[02:29:50.610 --> 02:29:52.230]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.150 --> 02:29:55.831]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.407 --> 02:30:01.408]  I had tried everything.
[02:30:01.469 --> 02:30:06.555]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating, I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[02:30:06.975 --> 02:30:11.461]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[02:30:11.802 --> 02:30:18.170]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[02:30:18.650 --> 02:30:29.138]  Now, there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[02:30:29.879 --> 02:30:34.002]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[02:30:34.342 --> 02:30:40.367]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[02:30:40.607 --> 02:30:41.748]  Now, that's results.

[02:32:11.827 --> 02:32:24.713]  Supernatural Silver is a revolutionary new silver solution that is clinically shown to be several hundred times more effective than colloidal or ionic silver, and is powerful enough to help protect you and your family.
[02:32:25.053 --> 02:32:29.035]  Supernatural Silver is scientifically supported, highly effective,
[02:32:29.215 --> 02:32:29.916]  We're good to go.
[02:33:03.318 --> 02:33:07.180]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:33:07.741 --> 02:33:11.543]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:13.084 --> 02:33:18.408]  Hey, I'm back, I'm back, and here's Dave Brubeck, take five.
[02:33:18.428 --> 02:33:23.872]  Hey, that was before rap.
[02:33:24.652 --> 02:33:27.354]  God, I grew up with Dave Brubeck, man.
[02:33:27.434 --> 02:33:28.415]  I love that stuff.
[02:33:29.758 --> 02:33:37.904]  This is Gerald Cilenti back on live on Alex Jones Show doing some of our trends in the news.
[02:33:38.644 --> 02:33:50.973]  And when I left off, I was talking about what's going on in Syria, what's going on in Iraq, and how this military-industrial complex is destroying the nation.
[02:33:51.713 --> 02:34:01.924]  And I said I would also give some positive elements of how we could turn this around, move forward, and rise to higher levels economically.
[02:34:02.344 --> 02:34:05.968]  Life of quality of life and quality of spirit.
[02:34:06.288 --> 02:34:08.270]  Because it really comes back to morality.
[02:34:08.931 --> 02:34:15.858]  Here, from the toilet paper today, armed men surround ministry in Tripoli.
[02:34:16.479 --> 02:34:30.233]  At least 20 pickup trucks loaded with anti-aircraft guns blocked the roads while men armed with AK-47s and sniper rifles directed traffic away from the buildings around the ministry.
[02:34:31.254 --> 02:34:31.454]  Hey!
[02:34:32.774 --> 02:34:37.595]  I heard Obama say that they were going to bring freedom and democracy to Libya.
[02:34:38.055 --> 02:34:43.897]  I heard that little weasel, Chicken Hawk Cameron, and Sarkozy from France.
[02:34:43.917 --> 02:34:44.897]  You remember him?
[02:34:44.917 --> 02:34:49.218]  Yeah, the guy that's now the former president of France.
[02:34:49.698 --> 02:34:59.261]  You know, the guy that now is going to be running a hedge fund, if everything goes right, saying how they were going to free those people of Libya from their oil.
[02:35:00.950 --> 02:35:02.392]  You think we'd be in Iraq?
[02:35:03.092 --> 02:35:05.115]  You think we'd be in any of these countries?
[02:35:05.615 --> 02:35:12.423]  Oh, Libya, by the way, has some of the best sweet crude oil on the planet.
[02:35:13.023 --> 02:35:15.326]  The whole system is breaking down.
[02:35:15.886 --> 02:35:19.590]  Everything they touch, they turn to garbage.
[02:35:20.231 --> 02:35:21.432]  They destroy it.
[02:35:22.199 --> 02:35:28.220]  When the governments, we have no business intervening in anyone else's country.
[02:35:28.760 --> 02:35:29.340]  Period.
[02:35:29.440 --> 02:35:30.261]  Paragraph.
[02:35:31.241 --> 02:35:32.821]  I am an American.
[02:35:34.201 --> 02:35:36.842]  I believe in the Constitution.
[02:35:37.602 --> 02:35:40.303]  I believe in the Declaration of Independence.
[02:35:40.663 --> 02:35:46.024]  And I believe in the principles upon which this country was founded.
[02:35:46.824 --> 02:36:03.631]  And when you see little cartoon characters like the Clintons and the Bushes and the Obamas doing their cheap routines and put them in a category with Madisons and Jeffersons...
[02:36:04.611 --> 02:36:20.969]  And Washingtons, who warned us not to become engaged in foreign entanglements, who are these little weasels like Lindsey Graham and McCain, insane McCain?
[02:36:21.229 --> 02:36:23.551]  And by the way, he's not a war hero.
[02:36:24.662 --> 02:36:24.902]  No.
[02:36:25.883 --> 02:36:33.490]  He crashed his plane a couple of times, couldn't land on the aircraft carrier, and if his old man wasn't an admiral, he would have been booted out.
[02:36:34.350 --> 02:36:35.752]  And what's he a hero for?
[02:36:36.152 --> 02:36:41.156]  Oh, he was flying over, bombing innocent Vietnamese, and they shot down his plane!
[02:36:41.417 --> 02:36:43.178]  That does not make you a hero!
[02:36:43.498 --> 02:36:47.021]  And these are the people that keep yelling, for more war!
[02:36:47.302 --> 02:36:47.922]  More war!
[02:36:47.962 --> 02:36:48.963]  Bring home the troops!
[02:36:49.283 --> 02:36:50.244]  Bring home the money!
[02:36:50.604 --> 02:36:51.846]  Rebuild America!
[02:36:52.847 --> 02:36:57.431]  This is garbage what these guys are talking, and you know you're not going to get the truth!
[02:36:58.012 --> 02:37:10.204]  Because all you have to do, if you want to torture yourself as I did the other night, watch the President's White House Correspondents Dinner.
[02:37:10.744 --> 02:37:13.887]  And you'll see the low level of human beings!
[02:37:15.302 --> 02:37:17.383]  That call themselves journalists.
[02:37:17.904 --> 02:37:21.226]  I love that guy on CNN, Don Lemon.
[02:37:21.646 --> 02:37:23.567]  Perfect name for the cat.
[02:37:23.948 --> 02:37:26.449]  A lemon if there ever was one.
[02:37:27.010 --> 02:37:29.351]  But I digress a little bit.
[02:37:29.991 --> 02:37:32.233]  Let's move on to some more news.
[02:37:33.734 --> 02:37:34.815]  On the economic front.
[02:37:35.854 --> 02:37:38.996]  Companies feel pinch on sales in Europe.
[02:37:39.636 --> 02:37:42.738]  This is from the front page of today's Wall Street Journal.
[02:37:43.319 --> 02:37:54.906]  Yeah, US companies raging from IBM, United Technologies, 3M, Xerox have missed revenue forecast, hurt by a combination of Europe's malaise.
[02:37:55.726 --> 02:38:01.250]  You see, if I had the BS button now, that word malaise,
[02:38:02.622 --> 02:38:03.603]  It's not a malaise.
[02:38:04.143 --> 02:38:05.224]  It's a depression!
[02:38:06.064 --> 02:38:07.465]  It's a depression in Greece.
[02:38:08.006 --> 02:38:11.168]  It's a depression in Spain.
[02:38:11.989 --> 02:38:15.651]  You're looking at unemployment rates that are approaching 30% officially.
[02:38:15.952 --> 02:38:23.137]  You're looking at over 52% unemployment, 57% unemployment rates in Spain, among the youth.
[02:38:23.797 --> 02:38:24.738]  Same thing in Greece.
[02:38:24.758 --> 02:38:25.478]  38% in Italy.
[02:38:25.498 --> 02:38:25.679]  Oh, Italy!
[02:38:25.699 --> 02:38:25.859]  Italy!
[02:38:30.080 --> 02:38:31.821]  They just elected a new government!
[02:38:32.322 --> 02:38:32.882]  Yeah!
[02:38:33.523 --> 02:38:35.304]  Here, look at this stupid photo!
[02:38:35.784 --> 02:38:38.206]  Look at this moronic photo!
[02:38:38.226 --> 02:38:40.648]  They're everywhere!
[02:38:41.469 --> 02:38:42.330]  Everywhere!
[02:38:42.670 --> 02:38:47.894]  We have moron leaders leading us everywhere!
[02:38:48.555 --> 02:38:51.917]  Because these are the kind of people that want to get the jobs.
[02:38:52.638 --> 02:38:54.779]  And you read about this clown that got in.
[02:38:55.360 --> 02:38:56.140]  Another guy.
[02:38:56.581 --> 02:38:58.983]  Another guy that never worked a day in his life.
[02:39:01.479 --> 02:39:02.920]  What's his name over here?
[02:39:04.462 --> 02:39:06.103]  Enrico Letta.
[02:39:06.463 --> 02:39:07.885]  Enrico Letta.
[02:39:08.445 --> 02:39:08.765]  Yeah.
[02:39:09.366 --> 02:39:10.387]  Enrico Letta.
[02:39:12.388 --> 02:39:23.278]  Letta's uncle, Gianni, was Berlusconi's chief political aide.
[02:39:24.179 --> 02:39:24.439]  Yeah.
[02:39:25.529 --> 02:39:31.751]  And you look at the new cabinet, the members of the three-card Monty, the technocrat they put in there.
[02:39:32.632 --> 02:39:33.732]  One after another.
[02:39:33.972 --> 02:39:37.254]  Forget these labels that you hear on TV.
[02:39:37.834 --> 02:39:39.955]  Center left, center right.
[02:39:40.315 --> 02:39:45.517]  They're all, they're all a part of the financial mafia.
[02:39:46.721 --> 02:39:47.641]  That's all it is.
[02:39:47.681 --> 02:39:49.762]  There are two mafias running the show.
[02:39:50.402 --> 02:39:55.703]  The Money Changes Mafia and the Military Industrial Complex Mafia.
[02:39:56.183 --> 02:39:58.944]  It's a dictatorship of finance.
[02:39:59.524 --> 02:40:04.305]  It's the merger of state and corporate powers, one after another.
[02:40:04.725 --> 02:40:15.308]  You go down the list and every one of these Italian cats that are in high positions are Euro-centric, Euro-favored.
[02:40:16.775 --> 02:40:25.875]  Guys and women that want to take more power away from the people and centralize it under the money changes.
[02:40:27.026 --> 02:40:29.188]  Euro is a failure.
[02:40:29.648 --> 02:40:38.434]  Italy, Spain, Greece, Portugal, Ireland, they're suffering the worst downturn since the Great Depression.
[02:40:38.814 --> 02:40:41.036]  The euro is a failure.
[02:40:41.376 --> 02:40:44.698]  It's only 12 years old.
[02:40:45.158 --> 02:40:46.899]  It's finito.
[02:40:47.180 --> 02:40:56.386]  They should bury it, but they're going to prop it up because it's easy when you have a centralized currency, a centralized bank, to steal your money.
[02:40:57.146 --> 02:41:00.767]  Makes it a lot easier doing a lot of smaller deals.
[02:41:02.508 --> 02:41:05.188]  And a guy yesterday went berserk in Italy.
[02:41:05.929 --> 02:41:08.789]  Mayhem greets Italy's, quote, grand coalition.
[02:41:09.189 --> 02:41:11.530]  Grand coalition of mobsters.
[02:41:11.990 --> 02:41:13.411]  Here, this is the guy.
[02:41:14.071 --> 02:41:25.194]  Luigi Preti, 46, unemployed and apparently driven to desperation, opened fire with a pistol, wounding two police officers.
[02:41:26.243 --> 02:41:27.824]  This is from the Financial Times.
[02:41:29.305 --> 02:41:33.067]  Unemployed, apparently driven to desperation.
[02:41:34.148 --> 02:41:41.713]  When people lose everything and have nothing left to lose, they lose it.
[02:41:43.013 --> 02:41:46.035]  And that's what we're seeing more and more of.
[02:41:47.016 --> 02:41:49.117]  Let's move on to some other news here.
[02:41:51.439 --> 02:41:53.480]  What do we got here in the Wall Street Journal?
[02:41:55.731 --> 02:41:57.572]  More about those Boston Bombers.
[02:41:57.592 --> 02:41:59.914]  This is a big story.
[02:42:01.995 --> 02:42:13.503]  Talk about the 19-year-old is being treated for gunshot wounds in his throat, head, and legs that he received during confrontations with police
[02:42:14.494 --> 02:42:17.017]  Days after the April 15th bombing.
[02:42:17.878 --> 02:42:20.040]  I'd be hitting the BS button on that one.
[02:42:20.441 --> 02:42:21.162]  You know why?
[02:42:21.682 --> 02:42:23.224]  You remember the story.
[02:42:23.544 --> 02:42:25.486]  The story was in the Washington Post.
[02:42:25.807 --> 02:42:27.609]  The story was all over the media.
[02:42:27.629 --> 02:42:28.690]  That's right.
[02:42:28.710 --> 02:42:30.292]  There was a confrontation.
[02:42:30.712 --> 02:42:31.512]  You heard the word.
[02:42:31.532 --> 02:42:32.933]  There was a confrontation.
[02:42:32.953 --> 02:42:33.974]  They found him in the boat.
[02:42:33.994 --> 02:42:34.334]  Remember?
[02:42:34.594 --> 02:42:41.477]  The guy goes outside, he's having a smoke, sees the top on his boat's missing, not put on right, sees some bloodstains.
[02:42:41.877 --> 02:42:43.558]  There's the kid lying there, wounded.
[02:42:43.958 --> 02:42:45.019]  And what do the cops do?
[02:42:45.859 --> 02:42:47.201]  You remember the first story.
[02:42:47.702 --> 02:42:49.905]  They exchanged gunfire!
[02:42:50.265 --> 02:42:50.746]  Yeah!
[02:42:51.286 --> 02:42:52.108]  Yeah, that's right!
[02:42:52.809 --> 02:42:54.751]  They had, what, 9,000 troops there?
[02:42:55.152 --> 02:42:58.576]  They could have, you know, they could have led the Battle of the Bulge.
[02:42:58.616 --> 02:43:00.919]  They had enough equipment and men and armaments.
[02:43:03.055 --> 02:43:04.835]  So no, the gun battle never happened!
[02:43:04.955 --> 02:43:05.736]  It was a lie!
[02:43:06.136 --> 02:43:09.076]  Just like the other lie, or misinformation, excuse me.
[02:43:09.777 --> 02:43:14.038]  Misinformation about how they also robbed a 7-Eleven that they never robbed.
[02:43:14.478 --> 02:43:16.298]  So why would anybody believe anything?
[02:43:16.658 --> 02:43:17.958]  But here's the way they wrote it.
[02:43:18.419 --> 02:43:20.899]  Again, this is from the Wall Street Journal.
[02:43:21.259 --> 02:43:23.800]  Received during confrontations with police.
[02:43:24.679 --> 02:43:24.939]  No.
[02:43:25.599 --> 02:43:27.120]  They shot into the boat!
[02:43:27.260 --> 02:43:28.681]  The kid was lying there!
[02:43:29.461 --> 02:43:31.202]  Couldn't they say, come out your hands up?
[02:43:32.022 --> 02:43:33.643]  Whatever happened to that one?
[02:43:33.663 --> 02:43:40.866]  What else do we have?
[02:43:42.127 --> 02:43:42.647]  Iceland.
[02:43:43.688 --> 02:43:46.289]  Iceland votes out pro-European leadership.
[02:43:47.049 --> 02:43:48.930]  Yay, yay, yay!
[02:43:49.890 --> 02:43:50.891]  Little Iceland.
[02:43:52.202 --> 02:43:53.925]  Tiny little Iceland.
[02:43:53.945 --> 02:43:55.928]  They didn't pay back the bankers.
[02:43:56.509 --> 02:43:58.211]  They're having a tough time over there.
[02:43:58.231 --> 02:44:05.222]  But they're not robbing the people of their money to give it to the banking operations.
[02:44:09.482 --> 02:44:17.827]  Little bit closer to home because again, you know, I was listening to the opening of the show with Mr. Jasper and how things have to change.
[02:44:17.867 --> 02:44:29.153]  And of course, when Alex Jones show, he always talks about, you know, stopping the corruption and bringing the bringing the nation back to the people.
[02:44:29.994 --> 02:44:32.755]  Here's a little story in Sunday's New York Times.
[02:44:34.256 --> 02:44:38.459]  Many openings at state agency goes to ties
[02:44:39.673 --> 02:44:42.957]  Goes to those with ties to Governor Cuomo.
[02:44:43.998 --> 02:44:47.501]  I'm only mentioning this because it's the same thing everywhere.
[02:44:48.182 --> 02:44:52.487]  If you read about the guy they just arrested in Bosnia.
[02:44:53.749 --> 02:44:58.911]  The guy in France that was supposed to be cracking down on tax evaders.
[02:44:58.951 --> 02:45:00.151]  You know, that minister.
[02:45:00.691 --> 02:45:05.133]  And then they found out he had a couple of million dollars in his Swiss account.
[02:45:05.653 --> 02:45:08.254]  It's the same thing everywhere.
[02:45:08.894 --> 02:45:15.236]  And nothing is going to change, nothing, until the morality changes.
[02:45:16.296 --> 02:45:18.417]  And the fish rots from the head up.
[02:45:20.365 --> 02:45:30.795]  So we learn by our leaders, we learn by those in power, and the power is corrupt from the top down.
[02:45:30.855 --> 02:45:31.056]  Here.
[02:45:32.694 --> 02:45:35.155]  New York State's Economic Development Agency.
[02:45:35.695 --> 02:45:40.498]  Economic Development Agencies, by the way, I got my master's degree in public administration.
[02:45:41.038 --> 02:45:42.379]  They're a waste of money.
[02:45:42.919 --> 02:45:46.561]  All they do is they give benefits to the very rich.
[02:45:47.001 --> 02:45:48.482]  Hey, I'm going to tell you what I'm going to do.
[02:45:48.502 --> 02:45:53.724]  I'm going to build a hotel in your dying town over here.
[02:45:53.744 --> 02:45:57.066]  I want a $10 million tax break.
[02:45:57.126 --> 02:46:00.527]  I want loan guarantees and some infrastructure repairs.
[02:46:00.847 --> 02:46:01.588]  And they do it.
[02:46:02.574 --> 02:46:03.775]  Which they should never do.
[02:46:03.855 --> 02:46:07.460]  But anyway.
[02:46:07.580 --> 02:46:11.324]  New York State Economic Development created a new position last June.
[02:46:11.364 --> 02:46:12.185]  A new position.
[02:46:12.786 --> 02:46:17.030]  We're paying taxes like crazy and they're creating a new position.
[02:46:18.154 --> 02:46:21.775]  And they found a candidate to fill it, a young man named Willard Younger.
[02:46:22.156 --> 02:46:28.538]  Yeah, young Willard Younger, who had just graduated from Colgate University with a degree.
[02:46:28.618 --> 02:46:29.518]  Now, check it out.
[02:46:29.938 --> 02:46:34.820]  If you want a degree in worthlessness, this guy couldn't do better.
[02:46:34.920 --> 02:46:36.601]  But I have one better, actually.
[02:46:36.881 --> 02:46:38.122]  And you'll hear that one, too.
[02:46:39.042 --> 02:46:41.983]  A degree in classics and religion.
[02:46:42.623 --> 02:46:46.445]  Now, you know what a degree in classics and religion gets you?
[02:46:47.361 --> 02:46:58.594]  It gets you a job with the Economic Development Agency, a special projects assistant, and a salary of $45,000 a year.
[02:47:01.137 --> 02:47:05.482]  Now, wouldn't you think if they put an ad out
[02:47:07.315 --> 02:47:17.180]  For a Projects Associate at a salary of $45,000 a year that could have actually gotten somebody qualified and with experience?
[02:47:18.921 --> 02:47:19.782]  Or could it be?
[02:47:19.802 --> 02:47:24.945]  I mean, being, you know, there are several million people in New York.
[02:47:26.092 --> 02:47:40.195]  His father, Steven P. Younger, is a lawyer and power broker in legal circles who was a member of one of Governor Andrew M. Cuomo's transitions team, and he's also donated $26,000.
[02:47:40.955 --> 02:47:47.916]  Yeah, to Mr. Cuomo's campaign over the years.
[02:47:47.996 --> 02:47:48.676]  Oh, nice.
[02:47:49.476 --> 02:47:50.677]  Oh, donated campaign.
[02:47:50.697 --> 02:47:52.737]  You know what these are called in real language?
[02:47:54.361 --> 02:47:55.883]  Not campaign donations.
[02:47:56.303 --> 02:47:58.025]  They're called bribes and payoffs.
[02:47:58.245 --> 02:47:59.406]  And you saw the payoff.
[02:47:59.847 --> 02:48:02.550]  That's why I'm a believer in direct democracy.
[02:48:02.970 --> 02:48:07.735]  The whole system is rigged, and if you're not in it, you don't get anything from it.
[02:48:08.116 --> 02:48:10.238]  This story actually gets a lot better, you know.
[02:48:10.979 --> 02:48:13.201]  It's one stupid thing after another.
[02:48:13.221 --> 02:48:16.524]  And the jobs that these guys get...
[02:48:17.185 --> 02:48:19.166]  There's this other guy, Mr. Molis.
[02:48:19.667 --> 02:48:27.432]  He was hired at $75,000 a year as a strategic planner associate.
[02:48:27.813 --> 02:48:35.939]  He graduated with a degree in A-S-S-Y-R-I-O-L-O-G-Y.
[02:48:36.499 --> 02:48:37.720]  Assyriology.
[02:48:37.740 --> 02:48:41.122]  The study of ancient Mesopotamia.
[02:48:41.142 --> 02:48:42.203]  Yeah!
[02:48:42.763 --> 02:48:43.084]  Yeah!
[02:48:44.912 --> 02:48:54.740]  His ties, his father and his father's real estate firm have donated a total of $75,000 to the Cuomo campaign.
[02:48:55.460 --> 02:48:58.863]  So I guess they broke even on that one, huh?
[02:48:58.883 --> 02:49:03.146]  75 into the campaign, 75 a year into his son's pocket.
[02:49:03.607 --> 02:49:08.831]  The whole game is rigged all over the world.
[02:49:10.452 --> 02:49:13.014]  So the stock market's going up a little bit today.
[02:49:13.374 --> 02:49:13.855]  How come?
[02:49:14.994 --> 02:49:18.717]  Well, as I said earlier, good news, good news!
[02:49:19.017 --> 02:49:21.960]  The Fed's going to keep its foot on the pedal!
[02:49:22.420 --> 02:49:23.261]  That's right!
[02:49:23.521 --> 02:49:26.123]  Pumping more money, that's boosting the market.
[02:49:27.024 --> 02:49:28.325]  Now, this is important.
[02:49:30.587 --> 02:49:34.210]  Interest rates, as we know, are at historic lows.
[02:49:34.831 --> 02:49:40.695]  So the other reason that the market's going up is pending home sales increased 1.5%.
[02:49:43.522 --> 02:49:48.504]  After a revised 1% decline the prior month.
[02:49:51.885 --> 02:49:55.766]  It was 0.4% when it came out with this number.
[02:49:55.806 --> 02:49:56.486]  Now remember, 1.5%
[02:50:02.776 --> 02:50:07.457]  This is after dumping trillions of dollars into the economy.
[02:50:07.957 --> 02:50:12.278]  This is after keeping interest rates at record lows.
[02:50:12.778 --> 02:50:22.121]  And this is after the FHA are giving out loans with people only putting down 5%.
[02:50:23.781 --> 02:50:31.963]  So you can see, even with all of this juice going in, it's not going to be a happy ending.
[02:50:33.752 --> 02:50:41.098]  And again, that's why I believe in gold.
[02:50:42.159 --> 02:50:44.721]  Gold is golden.
[02:50:45.662 --> 02:50:49.025]  Because they're gonna keep having to pump more money into it.
[02:50:49.045 --> 02:50:51.267]  It ain't working.
[02:50:51.287 --> 02:50:53.008]  It's not gonna work.
[02:50:54.670 --> 02:50:58.013]  But don't worry, they'll get us to war and that'll get your mind off it.
[02:51:00.171 --> 02:51:02.092]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[02:51:02.112 --> 02:51:04.053]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[02:51:04.274 --> 02:51:09.757]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[02:51:10.517 --> 02:51:13.699]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[02:51:13.960 --> 02:51:17.702]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[02:51:17.862 --> 02:51:19.043]  The fact is, you are.
[02:51:19.243 --> 02:51:20.023]  We all are.
[02:51:20.263 --> 02:51:22.585]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[02:51:22.885 --> 02:51:31.170]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoodsDirect.
[02:51:31.370 --> 02:51:32.591]  Be prepared before you need it.
[02:51:32.771 --> 02:51:35.933]  With nutrient-dense food you can store for up to 25 years.
[02:51:36.213 --> 02:51:38.455]  You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed you.
[02:51:38.595 --> 02:51:42.977]  Do what I've done and get your own supply of the best storable foods out there from eFoodsDirect.
[02:51:43.117 --> 02:51:48.961]  Call 800-409-5633 or visit them on the web at efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:51:59.966 --> 02:52:03.488]  Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins.
[02:52:03.828 --> 02:52:04.549]  That bears repeating.
[02:52:04.869 --> 02:52:08.391]  Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins.
[02:52:08.751 --> 02:52:12.993]  And Pro-EM1 Daily Probiotic Cleanse is the key to digestive health.
[02:52:13.313 --> 02:52:18.776]  Pro-EM1 is a powerful liquid probiotic, strong enough to cleanse, gentle enough to use every day.
[02:52:19.156 --> 02:52:21.357]  Pro-EM-1 is dairy, wheat, and soy free.

[02:52:24.119 --> 02:52:26.020]  Contains no preservatives or animal products.
[02:52:26.260 --> 02:52:28.221]  Supports a healthy digestive and immune system.
[02:52:28.361 --> 02:52:29.102]  Supports weight loss.
[02:52:29.382 --> 02:52:30.883]  Improves absorption of food nutrients.
[02:52:31.183 --> 02:52:32.584]  Aids in controlling yeast infections.
[02:52:32.844 --> 02:52:34.085]  Is never freeze-dried.
[02:52:34.425 --> 02:52:38.287]  And uses three groups of live, viable, beneficial microbes to cleanse and remove toxins.
[02:52:38.627 --> 02:52:42.069]  Order Pro-EM1 Daily Probiotic Cleanse at Terragonics.com.

[02:52:49.133 --> 02:52:50.234]  Pro-EM1, the raw probiotic.
[02:52:59.278 --> 02:53:01.979]  Do you suffer from low-functioning adrenal or thyroid gland?
[02:53:02.179 --> 02:53:07.921]  Did you know that mercury from your dental fillings comes off your teeth both as a vapor and as metal particles into your body?
[02:53:08.021 --> 02:53:11.782]  Wherever mercury deposits in your body, it stops cells from functioning normally.
[02:53:12.023 --> 02:53:14.844]  Animal studies show that mercury causes kidney function to drop by 60%.
[02:53:15.984 --> 02:53:16.344]  I don't know.
[02:53:33.740 --> 02:53:45.972]  After investigating most high-end whey proteins on the market, only one is the most non-denatured, the most active, the most complete, and in our opinion, the most powerful, in what nature originally put into the fresh raw whey.
[02:53:46.312 --> 02:53:47.873]  It is One World Whey.

[02:54:06.812 --> 02:54:08.454]  Last segment, last segment.
[02:54:08.574 --> 02:54:10.016]  Thank you Alex Jones.
[02:54:10.056 --> 02:54:22.713]  This is the Alex Jones Show and this is Gerald Cilenti giving you an example of our Trends in the News that we do every Monday through Friday as part of your subscription to the Trends Journal.
[02:54:23.234 --> 02:54:27.379]  Now, I said I was going to give some positive elements, say a little bit more about China.
[02:54:27.840 --> 02:54:30.163]  China's going to do better than the United States.
[02:54:30.483 --> 02:54:32.586]  I don't believe China's going to go to war.
[02:54:32.926 --> 02:54:34.929]  They're building their internal economy.
[02:54:35.169 --> 02:54:40.355]  They have 1.2 billion people there, and they have a lot of business to do with each other.
[02:54:41.016 --> 02:54:43.178]  And that's where they're going to go in the future.
[02:54:43.558 --> 02:54:45.639]  And that's the way America should go.
[02:54:46.019 --> 02:54:48.021]  That's the way Italy should go.
[02:54:48.361 --> 02:54:50.322]  You know my saying, think for yourself.
[02:54:50.723 --> 02:54:52.264]  That's the way I see it.
[02:54:52.824 --> 02:54:55.306]  I want my money staying in my country.
[02:54:55.606 --> 02:54:56.967]  I don't want it going anywhere.
[02:54:57.287 --> 02:55:00.189]  Anywhere in foreign aid, anywhere in foreign products.
[02:55:00.629 --> 02:55:04.732]  I want to buy shoes from America.
[02:55:04.972 --> 02:55:07.294]  I want to buy my shirts made in America.
[02:55:07.814 --> 02:55:10.576]  And I want to buy all my product local.
[02:55:11.456 --> 02:55:18.021]  And boy do we have great local product up here in Colonial Kingston in the heart of the Hudson Valley.
[02:55:18.501 --> 02:55:24.825]  I just had some coca-cola that they made over here locally that was as good as I've had in Italy.
[02:55:25.326 --> 02:55:32.570]  The way we bring this back is we do business with each other just like the Chinese are going to do.
[02:55:32.871 --> 02:55:37.754]  And hey, if it's good enough for the Chinese, why shouldn't it be good enough for us?
[02:55:38.477 --> 02:55:50.462]  Or maybe you want to buy that next shirt from another sweatshop that blows up, burns down, or is destroyed in Bangladesh that just killed 400 people.
[02:55:51.183 --> 02:55:57.165]  So you could go shopping at a large self-storage unit that they call Walmart or Target.
[02:55:58.086 --> 02:55:59.006]  Buy local.
[02:55:59.306 --> 02:56:05.669]  And number one, again, think for yourself, only what I'm saying, break the chains.
[02:56:07.185 --> 02:56:11.266]  If you're gonna go out for a cup of coffee, break the chains!
[02:56:11.366 --> 02:56:12.166]  Go local!
[02:56:12.846 --> 02:56:14.247]  Break the chains!
[02:56:14.627 --> 02:56:17.207]  We have become corporate slaves!
[02:56:18.708 --> 02:56:25.549]  Unless, of course, you go to Colgate, and your old man gives Cuomo money, or whatever other state you live in.
[02:56:26.029 --> 02:56:28.970]  Then you'll get a good job with your degree in worthlessness.
[02:56:31.310 --> 02:56:33.391]  So those are some positive elements.
[02:56:34.571 --> 02:56:37.314]  The future doesn't have to be the way it's going.
[02:56:37.874 --> 02:56:39.556]  We create the future.
[02:56:40.056 --> 02:56:43.259]  Again, go back to the beginning of this program.
[02:56:43.859 --> 02:56:45.901]  Look at that correspondence dinner.
[02:56:46.382 --> 02:56:48.704]  Look at these low-life politicians.
[02:56:49.424 --> 02:56:51.847]  Look how low they have taken this nation.
[02:56:53.769 --> 02:56:55.730]  So I want to thank Alex Jones.
[02:56:56.490 --> 02:56:58.491]  I love being on this show.
[02:56:58.932 --> 02:57:00.332]  Keep up the good fight.
[02:57:00.452 --> 02:57:01.793]  Everyone join in.
[02:57:02.313 --> 02:57:05.195]  And now I want to turn it over to Jakari Jackson.
[02:57:05.215 --> 02:57:09.537]  This is Gerald Cilenti and that was some of today's Trends in the News.
[02:57:10.871 --> 02:57:12.693]  Alright, Jakari Jackson back here live.
[02:57:12.753 --> 02:57:14.234]  If Gerald, is Gerald still with us?
[02:57:14.254 --> 02:57:18.338]  I just want to ask, Mr. Salente, if I can ask you, you ended talking about China.
[02:57:18.358 --> 02:57:24.203]  How do you feel about the Chinese market telling us how to make our movies, demanding edits to movies like World War Z and Iron Man 3?
[02:57:26.172 --> 02:57:28.814]  Hey, the Chinese own our money.
[02:57:28.894 --> 02:57:30.815]  You know, they're buying up all the movie theaters.
[02:57:30.835 --> 02:57:33.376]  They're buying up a whole chain of movie theaters.
[02:57:34.097 --> 02:57:34.717]  You know that.
[02:57:34.857 --> 02:57:36.058]  They own a big chain.
[02:57:36.158 --> 02:57:37.999]  So, you know, they're in control.
[02:57:38.039 --> 02:57:39.059]  The golden rule.
[02:57:39.460 --> 02:57:41.040]  Those who have the gold rule.
[02:57:41.721 --> 02:57:42.581]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:57:42.882 --> 02:57:45.143]  Now, Mr. Celente, how can people get a hold of your materials?
[02:57:46.124 --> 02:57:49.986]  TrendsJournal.com, TrendsJournal.com, and Jakari.
[02:57:50.467 --> 02:57:53.969]  We know that people are having a difficult time, you know, making ends meet.
[02:57:54.229 --> 02:57:56.090]  We have a discount request page there.
[02:57:56.450 --> 02:58:01.574]  We try to make the Trends Journal available to everybody so that they can prepare for the future.
[02:58:01.594 --> 02:58:06.737]  There's a bright future for those who see the future and move in the right directions.
[02:58:07.637 --> 02:58:09.919]  All right, Gerald Saliente, definitely appreciate your time, sir.
[02:58:10.563 --> 02:58:11.423]  Thank you, Jakari.
[02:58:11.844 --> 02:58:14.785]  All right, well, that's it for this edition of the Alex Jones Radio Show.
[02:58:14.845 --> 02:58:19.367]  Thanks to Mr. Salente, Alex, David Knight, and everybody else who had a hand in this.
[02:58:19.427 --> 02:58:20.928]  The great crew working overtime.
[02:58:21.588 --> 02:58:24.870]  Alex will be back, or at least Skyping in, I should say, tomorrow.
[02:58:25.390 --> 02:58:28.151]  Also, myself, maybe David Knight will be back in here as well.
[02:58:28.472 --> 02:58:29.532]  So, InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:58:29.592 --> 02:58:31.693]  Tonight, David Knight will be hosting.
[02:58:32.454 --> 02:58:34.575]  Seabell admins will be our guests.
[02:58:34.595 --> 02:58:35.095]  We'll see you then.
[02:58:41.434 --> 02:58:43.255]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:44.835 --> 02:58:47.136]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.998 --> 02:58:59.681]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal Bend Soap Company.
[02:59:00.102 --> 02:59:03.683]  Alex and his staff have used these pure soap products for years.
