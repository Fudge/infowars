[00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.232]  Education in the United States is under attack by the federal government.
[00:00:11.672 --> 00:00:14.074]  It's supposed to be handled by the state anyway.
[00:00:14.694 --> 00:00:19.397]  The vehicle that they're using for their destruction is Common Core and also C-Scope.
[00:00:20.148 --> 00:00:31.156]  Common Core was created by the NGA, National Governors Association, and CCSSO, Council of Chief State School Officers, with zero input from states, school boards, and parents.
[00:00:31.556 --> 00:00:34.399]  They have no authority from any state to write the standards.
[00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:46.488]  On the Common Core website, in their own disclaimer, they say that NGA and CCSO don't warrant, endorse, approve, or certify the info on the Common Core website.
[00:00:47.188 --> 00:00:49.809]  Currently in the news, downloading is mean.
[00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:54.751]  Content industry drafts an anti-piracy curriculum for elementary schools.
[00:00:55.131 --> 00:01:04.734]  Listen up children, cheating on your homework is bad, but not as bad as sharing a music track with a friend, or otherwise depriving the content industry of its well-earned profits.
[00:01:05.214 --> 00:01:11.443]  It suggests falsely that ideas are property and that building on others' ideas always requires permission.
[00:01:11.844 --> 00:01:20.937]  The overriding message of this curriculum is that students' time should be consumed not in creating, but in worrying about their impact on corporate profits.
[00:01:21.377 --> 00:01:32.867]  And students at Hartford Magnet Trinity College Academy in Hartford, Connecticut were on a field trip last November to Nature's Classroom when they were asked to reenact slavery as part of an educational exercise.
[00:01:33.028 --> 00:01:34.569]  The fact that they used the n-word.
[00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:40.574]  I mean, how dare you do that, say that to my child, and call it an educational experience?
[00:01:40.915 --> 00:01:41.215]  Really?
[00:01:41.775 --> 00:01:42.296]  You could not?
[00:01:42.316 --> 00:01:45.298]  I mean, Hartford, you could not see that something was wrong with this?
[00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:53.984]  In Denton, Texas, they have rewritten the Constitution to read, the people have a right to keep and bear arms in a state militia.
[00:01:54.165 --> 00:02:04.471]  The actual Second Amendment reads, a well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
[00:02:04.832 --> 00:02:09.095]  I guess the writers of the Advanced Placement Test figured they could change the Constitution in the history book.
[00:02:09.895 --> 00:02:13.398]  That way they can indoctrinate our children into their agenda.
[00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.683]  And if you don't agree with Common Core, this could happen to you as a parent.
[00:02:29.593 --> 00:02:33.176]  I'm Gigi Ornette with an InfoWars Nightly News Special Report.
