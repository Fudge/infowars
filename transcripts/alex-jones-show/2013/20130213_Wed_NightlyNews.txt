[00:00:02.881 --> 00:00:03.181]  We're good.
[00:00:36.096 --> 00:00:37.837]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:37.957 --> 00:00:38.598]  I'm David Knight.
[00:00:38.738 --> 00:00:39.619]  It's Wednesday, February 13, 2013.
[00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.552]  Now, tonight's top story is the Waco-style conclusion to the Chris Dorner manhunt.
[00:00:47.092 --> 00:01:01.778]  If you watched the nightly news last night, you saw Alex Jones talking live as it was happening, as the cabin was burning, and talking about how two hours earlier, before it had even started, he had predicted that this exact thing was going to happen.
[00:01:02.258 --> 00:01:03.439]  Now, how did he know that?
[00:01:04.139 --> 00:01:05.900]  Well, he predicted what was going to happen
[00:01:06.613 --> 00:01:10.635]  When they cut the CNN live feed, because that's exactly what they did in Waco.
[00:01:10.695 --> 00:01:20.979]  When they didn't want people to see what they were about to do, they cut the live feed because CNN and the mainstream media essentially helps the police to cover up what they don't want people to be seeing.
[00:01:21.559 --> 00:01:27.622]  And this is exactly what they did at Waco, which, by the way, is coming up for its 20th anniversary April the 19th.
[00:01:29.011 --> 00:01:38.300]  Now, it got more interesting because as the day progressed, this morning we had some audio recordings of police scanners talking about how they were going to burn the place down.
[00:01:38.941 --> 00:01:48.370]  Now, we reported it, InfoWars reported on their website, Alex talked about it on the radio program, Drudge linked to it, it was going around the internet, but the mainstream media still was not talking about it.
[00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.775]  But listen to the actual transcripts from this article by Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:01:54.167 --> 00:01:57.028]  All right, we're going to go ahead with the plan with the burners, says one officer.
[00:01:57.208 --> 00:01:58.249]  Copy, replies another.
[00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:00.630]  Like we talked about, the first officer responds.
[00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.112]  The burners are deployed and we have fire, says another officer moments later.
[00:02:05.132 --> 00:02:13.515]  In a separate clip carried by a local news channel, police are heard to say, effing burn this MFR and burn that effing house down.
[00:02:13.675 --> 00:02:19.238]  And in a CBS LA broadcast, they said, get the gas and burn it down.
[00:02:20.174 --> 00:02:28.980]  Now, as this was happening, like I said, the mainstream media was simply talking about the fact that the cabin was surrounded, and then a fire started.
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.083]  There was no discussion as to what might have started the fire.
[00:02:32.743 --> 00:02:37.707]  There certainly wasn't any fingers pointed at the police for perhaps doing it deliberately.
[00:02:38.387 --> 00:02:39.548]  None of that was being talked about.
[00:02:39.628 --> 00:02:40.969]  As a matter of fact, it got even worse.
[00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:53.926]  As the police scanner audio started circulating and getting wider and wider coverage, in the afternoon CNN had a commentator on and they talked about the tape without actually playing the quotes because the quotes are pretty explicit.
[00:02:54.707 --> 00:02:56.770]  And it was dismissed as being bravado.
[00:02:57.836 --> 00:02:59.797]  Well, it wasn't actually.
[00:02:59.997 --> 00:03:04.338]  A lot of things have changed since Waco, as far as the media is concerned.
[00:03:04.358 --> 00:03:07.320]  We now have an alternative media that helps to get the truth out.
[00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:15.463]  When Waco happened, the internet was in its infancy, and radio was in its infancy.
[00:03:15.623 --> 00:03:21.685]  Now those things, we have a pretty large network, pretty large footprint, and we can kind of go head to head with the mainstream media.
[00:03:22.563 --> 00:03:25.746]  Take a look at really what we've learned from this Chris Dorner manhunt.
[00:03:25.886 --> 00:03:27.727]  There's a couple of things to me that stand out.
[00:03:27.808 --> 00:03:32.852]  Number one is due process is essentially dead if the police don't want to bother with it.
[00:03:33.743 --> 00:03:41.648]  That's what we saw with this manhunt, basically with no apologies, no explanation, and probably with no investigation.
[00:03:42.068 --> 00:03:45.530]  If they want to, they can just act as judge, jury, and executioner.
[00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:53.495]  The other thing is we have an armed, militarized police that feel like they are allowed to threaten and even shoot the public.
[00:03:54.235 --> 00:03:56.236]  Uh, if they feel threatened themselves.
[00:03:56.957 --> 00:04:10.203]  Uh, this is one, probably the most alarming thing to come out of this story was how the police were shooting up vehicles that didn't even match the description of the suspect's vehicles, shot people who in no way, shape, or form looked like the, uh, the suspect.
[00:04:11.023 --> 00:04:14.005]  Uh, women, uh, who were delivering papers, that sort of thing.
[00:04:14.025 --> 00:04:20.209]  Uh, again, no apologies, no outrage at this kind of behavior, just matter-of-factly, it happened.
[00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.432]  And then we also see how the mainstream media has been complicit in all this.
[00:04:24.492 --> 00:04:33.898]  Not only in covering up the initial setting of the fires, but then basically remaining silent about it as the story spread, and then even trying to kind of explain it away.
[00:04:34.718 --> 00:04:45.364]  Uh, and they're now spending any criticism of, uh, the police actions and, uh, you know, in terms of burning down this, uh, cabin, uh, they're now spending that as support for Chris Dorner.
[00:04:46.124 --> 00:04:47.585]  And let me make this perfectly clear.
[00:04:47.925 --> 00:04:52.127]  I don't support, and no one here does, uh, support the actions of Chris Dorner.
[00:04:52.147 --> 00:04:55.349]  Uh, his actions were inexcusable and reprehensible.
[00:04:55.962 --> 00:05:00.266]  But that in no way justifies the kind of vigilantism that we've seen from the L.A.
[00:05:00.326 --> 00:05:00.947]  Police Department.
[00:05:01.007 --> 00:05:03.449]  As a matter of fact, police departments all the way across California.
[00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.292]  They have to take a higher road.
[00:05:06.332 --> 00:05:08.154]  They have to stay within the law.
[00:05:08.494 --> 00:05:11.938]  They have to be above reproach in the way that they handle things.
[00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:17.243]  And they have acted recklessly and carelessly as they were in fear for their lives.
[00:05:17.972 --> 00:05:27.975]  Now, to get an idea as to how far the media will take this kind of action, let's take a look at an article from Melissa Melton.
[00:05:28.415 --> 00:05:32.356]  She asked, how many wallets with ID cards in them did Dorner own?
[00:05:33.197 --> 00:05:36.198]  His wallet has kind of taken on a traveling gnome status.
[00:05:36.938 --> 00:05:43.460]  Initially, the Guardian said that they had found his wallet inside the burned cabin.
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:50.283]  In the headlines, they said, in the body of the story, they said his wallet was found beside charred human remains.
[00:05:50.343 --> 00:05:58.928]  Now the question is, if it was so intense in the cabin to burn it completely down and to char the human remains, how would they find his wallet intact?
[00:05:58.968 --> 00:06:01.049]  And why would it be beside his remains?
[00:06:01.089 --> 00:06:03.270]  Why would it be out of his wallet, out of his pants?
[00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.872]  The Washington Times also noted that after an intense hours-long fire,
[00:06:08.332 --> 00:06:20.643]  One official with knowledge of the police investigation spoke on condition of anonymity said investigators found a California driver's license with the name Christopher Dorner on it, along with a wallet and various personal items inside the cabin.
[00:06:21.144 --> 00:06:23.005]  That's according to the Associated Press.
[00:06:23.786 --> 00:06:27.189]  Now, back on February 11th, two days earlier, the L.A.
[00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:38.137]  Times reported that after authorities interviewed a boat captain down at the U.S.-Mexican border, on Thursday they found his wallet and ID cards at a port of entry near the U.S.-Mexico border.
[00:06:38.797 --> 00:06:46.543]  Fox News also reported the same thing, that his wallet had been found near the border along with other ID papers.
[00:06:47.284 --> 00:06:52.348]  And if that isn't strange enough, a San Diego paper that also reported the border incident
[00:06:52.908 --> 00:07:04.551]  Ben said that a shuttle bus driver turned over Dorner's wallet and LAPD police badge and photo ID to the San Diego police after a passerby found them near Linderberg Field.
[00:07:05.515 --> 00:07:14.443]  So, I mean, it's amazing that no matter how preposterous the stories are, the mainstream media never fact-checks anything.
[00:07:14.463 --> 00:07:18.586]  They don't look at the contradictions inherent in finding his wallet in three different places.
[00:07:19.107 --> 00:07:25.352]  They never question the idea that his wallet could survive a fire like it was made out of some kind of black box material.
[00:07:25.832 --> 00:07:27.174]  They never question any of this.
[00:07:27.234 --> 00:07:31.978]  They just dutifully report whatever they're told, like a press release from the police.
[00:07:33.476 --> 00:07:36.222]  There was some different kind of incompetence we've got here.
[00:07:36.282 --> 00:07:39.408]  The TSA breaks a world-renowned cellist's $20,000 bow.
[00:07:41.993 --> 00:07:45.296]  Uh, the fellow said, uh, my bow must have been moved out of its cover.
[00:07:45.917 --> 00:07:48.959]  Uh, the artist is Alban Gerhardt, a German musician.
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:55.825]  He said in an interview, instead of putting it back in, they just slammed the case shut and broke the bow that way over the bridge.
[00:07:56.226 --> 00:08:02.991]  Now, this is a rare bow that was made by 19th century German bowmaker Heinrich Knopf, and it was possibly damaged beyond repair.
[00:08:03.832 --> 00:08:12.157]  Well, actually it is a shame that we have a TSA that feels that they can do that and are just as unaccountable to those types of actions as the LA Police feel that they are.
[00:08:25.131 --> 00:08:32.473]  If you saw the State of the Union address last night, you saw Obama call for indoctrinating children at an earlier age.
[00:08:32.953 --> 00:08:42.576]  That's essentially what he was calling for when he said he wanted to allow everyone to have access to government-provided and subsidized preschool from the age of three up.
[00:08:43.725 --> 00:08:52.412]  During a State of the Union address last night, Obama called for universal preschool education to ensure that all four-year-olds have access to quality preschool, according to ABC News.
[00:08:53.152 --> 00:09:01.318]  Now, Michael Tennant wrote, the objective is clearly to get as many children into the clutches of the state educational system as early as possible.
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:13.656]  Even though the government admits that Head Start is a dismal failure with only a few exceptions, teacher and classroom characteristics did not differ significantly between children in the Head Start group and those in the control group.
[00:09:14.176 --> 00:09:15.318]  This is in a study in 2010.
[00:09:17.581 --> 00:09:19.882]  And I would finish with a quote from the article here.
[00:09:19.982 --> 00:09:33.050]  Karen DeCoster says, the confinement of children on the part of authoritarian figures who demand mandatory attendance illustrates how the federal public school system has become a security garrison with satellite detainment facilities.
[00:09:33.697 --> 00:09:49.439]  Moreover, yanking children from their parents and assimilating them into dumbed-down, draconian learning pools based on age, collectivizing their learning experience in a quasi-prison environment has not worked, and it will never be ideal for the vast majority of the children.
[00:09:50.396 --> 00:09:54.581]  Well, that has always, though, been the purpose of government schools.
[00:09:55.141 --> 00:10:03.390]  And we have an interview later on in this news report with someone who talks about what's happening here in the state of Texas with some new curriculum experiments.
[00:10:04.752 --> 00:10:11.299]  It has always been the purpose of government to get children as early as possible to separate them from their families and from their families' values.
[00:10:11.966 --> 00:10:14.809]  We saw it happen with Indians and the reservation system.
[00:10:14.829 --> 00:10:19.894]  They took them away from their parents and sent them away to be schooled in Western schools across the country.
[00:10:20.555 --> 00:10:29.484]  We've seen it in the writings of the people who founded the educational system in America, John Dewey and Horseman.
[00:10:29.604 --> 00:10:34.169]  And we've also seen it as early as Plato's Republic, and we'll talk about all that in our interview coming up.
[00:10:35.253 --> 00:10:39.476]  Well, our quote for the night is from James Madison, one of the founders of our country.
[00:10:39.856 --> 00:10:47.301]  And he recognized, as most of the other founders did, the importance of history and the human nature.
[00:10:47.721 --> 00:10:54.165]  And he says, the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home.
[00:10:55.180 --> 00:11:08.227]  And we're seeing that happen in our time because we have been kind of, had a kind of amnesia about what has happened in the past as well as a real sheepish-like ignorance of human nature.
[00:11:08.387 --> 00:11:18.452]  So now what we're seeing is the same types of tactics and militarization and population control that we have used in other countries in wars where we have invaded other countries.
[00:11:18.492 --> 00:11:20.153]  We're now seeing that brought home.
[00:11:21.058 --> 00:11:22.020]  Well, we'll be right back.
[00:11:22.081 --> 00:11:30.279]  After the break, we've got an interview, like I said, with Ginger Russell, and she's going to tell us what's happening in Texas, but it has implications for people across the country.
[00:11:35.882 --> 00:11:39.164]  ProPure is introducing ProOne.
[00:11:39.784 --> 00:11:43.946]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on the go.
[00:11:44.686 --> 00:11:48.428]  This is the ProOne by ProPure.
[00:11:48.688 --> 00:11:49.929]  You wanted it, you got it.
[00:11:50.309 --> 00:11:55.211]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[00:11:55.712 --> 00:12:00.154]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:12:03.075 --> 00:12:15.140]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:19.321]  It cuts out the acid derivative of fluoride.
[00:12:19.642 --> 00:12:27.144]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gates we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code water.
[00:12:27.985 --> 00:12:30.186]  This is the only system that in one unit
[00:12:31.446 --> 00:12:46.637]  Helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands, and sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:12:47.197 --> 00:12:50.260]  This is a revolution against the tyrants.
[00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:56.144]  They love putting the toxic acid base of fluoride into your water.
[00:12:56.184 --> 00:13:03.570]  They love the fact that it's an adjuvant supercharging the trace Prozac in the water and the hormones and the other chemicals.
[00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:12.477]  By cutting out fluoride, you cut out the turbocharger in all the poison being artificially introduced into your body.
[00:13:13.157 --> 00:13:14.298]  This is what I use.
[00:13:14.758 --> 00:13:15.599]  It's a win-win.
[00:13:15.919 --> 00:13:18.060]  You get a high quality product at the lowest price.
[00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:19.601]  You support the InfoWar.
[00:13:19.961 --> 00:13:25.745]  Get your Pro Pure with the new Pro One filters today at InfoWarStore.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:13:34.375 --> 00:13:38.899]  Alex Jones here with a message that could revolutionize health in this country.
[00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:45.025]  Going back about a year and a half ago, I began to learn about the incredible health effects of longevity products.
[00:13:45.425 --> 00:13:47.768]  Erin Dykes lost 92 pounds.
[00:13:48.148 --> 00:13:51.051]  We're going to show you some before and afters.
[00:13:51.471 --> 00:13:53.233]  Aaron, break down what happened.
[00:13:53.254 --> 00:13:53.834]  Your story.
[00:13:54.095 --> 00:13:59.181]  I've worked really hard with diet and exercise to try to lose weight, but I just didn't get the results.
[00:13:59.221 --> 00:14:00.082]  It just didn't happen.
[00:14:00.383 --> 00:14:02.966]  Then I saw what you were doing with Infowarsteam.com.
[00:14:03.466 --> 00:14:07.251]  I wasn't even trying to lose weight, but I got it because I wanted to feel better energy.
[00:14:07.311 --> 00:14:07.892]  I wanted that nutrition.
[00:14:07.992 --> 00:14:10.434]  I want to challenge our radio listeners to go to Infowarsteam.com.
[00:14:10.454 --> 00:14:14.037]  Sign up as a distributor and get wholesale pricing discounts at Infowarsteam.com.
[00:14:40.472 --> 00:14:43.015]  Well, many parents are concerned that Johnny can't read.
[00:14:43.416 --> 00:14:52.148]  But, as Charlotte Izabeau pointed out in the deliberate dumbing down of America that we sell at InfoWarsStore.com, that's never really been the purpose of the government schools.
[00:14:52.608 --> 00:14:55.292]  The real purpose of government schools has been social engineering.
[00:14:56.044 --> 00:15:02.328]  Now, we have something here in Texas called Seascope, and we've got someone who knows all about it, has been following this and exposing it.
[00:15:02.368 --> 00:15:09.952]  Her name is Ginger Russell, and although this is essentially a state story, I think this is something that's going to have implications nationwide.
[00:15:10.372 --> 00:15:10.952]  Ginger, welcome.
[00:15:11.933 --> 00:15:13.214]  Hi, thank you for having me.
[00:15:13.794 --> 00:15:14.354]  Thanks for coming.
[00:15:14.554 --> 00:15:15.555]  Tell us a little bit about this.
[00:15:15.575 --> 00:15:18.216]  Now, this is in about 80% of the schools in Texas.
[00:15:18.537 --> 00:15:20.778]  Tell us what you find troubling about Seascope.
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:24.243]  Well roughly between 70 and 80 percent.
[00:15:24.864 --> 00:15:28.468]  What initiated me in the controversy was my mother is a science author.
[00:15:28.508 --> 00:15:36.058]  She's written over 50 plus books and she retired and she was trying to tutor some children in a local school district in Marlin Independent School District in Texas.
[00:15:37.399 --> 00:15:42.482]  They had no textbooks, and when she requested some lessons, they knew her from her reputation.
[00:15:42.502 --> 00:15:50.766]  They gave her one lesson, and she found so many errors with it that she requested additional lessons to look at, and they refused.
[00:15:50.867 --> 00:15:54.589]  All the way up through the superintendent, they wouldn't give her any lessons to help the kids.
[00:15:55.209 --> 00:15:56.710]  And remember, they had no textbooks.
[00:15:57.410 --> 00:16:06.894]  And she requested at the Education Service Center in Waco, which is Region 12, they would not give her any lessons.
[00:16:06.954 --> 00:16:07.655]  And they know her.
[00:16:07.775 --> 00:16:09.055]  She's done workshops for them.
[00:16:09.936 --> 00:16:12.117]  And that sort of raised the curiosity.
[00:16:12.157 --> 00:16:16.659]  This was back November of a year ago, and we've been researching it ever since.
[00:16:17.359 --> 00:16:29.916]  That's kind of interesting because Texas is one of the largest markets of school textbooks, second only to California, and they have a lot of influence on the kind of textbooks that are sold nationally, those two markets, California and Texas.
[00:16:30.797 --> 00:16:33.621]  So it's kind of strange that they wouldn't have any textbooks.
[00:16:33.661 --> 00:16:34.823]  Why would they get rid of the textbooks?
[00:16:35.649 --> 00:16:36.870]  Well, that's a good question.
[00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:41.852]  Initially, a lot of the smaller districts elected, because this isn't a cheap product.
[00:16:41.912 --> 00:16:46.394]  You lease it at the minimum $7 per kid per year.
[00:16:47.094 --> 00:16:53.277]  And a lot of school districts, especially the smaller ones who don't have the funds, would elect to just use it and no textbooks.
[00:16:53.977 --> 00:16:55.578]  And it was pushed for that.
[00:16:55.899 --> 00:16:57.120]  They pushed that originally.
[00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:02.284]  Now, Seascope, basically the directors, they will not take responsibility for anything.
[00:17:02.484 --> 00:17:09.169]  They totally will say it's up to the local school district whether they purchase any material or not to go along with the Seascope.
[00:17:09.589 --> 00:17:11.471]  The online curriculum is what it is.
[00:17:12.451 --> 00:17:14.853]  Now, there were some other issues too, weren't there, when it first came out?
[00:17:14.893 --> 00:17:21.759]  Didn't they have non-disclosure agreements from teachers and that sort of thing that got people kind of concerned about the secrecy involved in it?
[00:17:22.499 --> 00:17:23.200]  Exactly.
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:30.806]  When they would not release the lessons to my mother and we had gotten, I started tweeting and Facebooking about it.
[00:17:30.886 --> 00:17:35.210]  Parents were contacting me and saying they could not get the lessons for their children.
[00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:40.875]  We have one dentist out of Beaumont, David Stovall, and they would not let him get the lesson content.
[00:17:40.895 --> 00:17:42.016]  So he took his kids out of
[00:17:42.056 --> 00:17:42.436]  I think so.
[00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:07.270]  Right, right.
[00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:09.492]  Yeah, that raises a lot of red flags.
[00:18:09.512 --> 00:18:10.492]  They don't want anybody to see it.
[00:18:10.812 --> 00:18:12.373]  But now we have seen some of these lessons.
[00:18:12.413 --> 00:18:16.696]  Tell us some of the things that you have seen in it that parents would probably object to.
[00:18:17.276 --> 00:18:19.798]  Well, my initial finding was last year.
[00:18:19.978 --> 00:18:24.801]  It was a PowerPoint presentation on Islam, and it gave the five pillars.
[00:18:25.241 --> 00:18:26.722]  It gave verses of the Koran.
[00:18:27.302 --> 00:18:32.105]  I printed it off, and once the directors of the education
[00:18:33.046 --> 00:18:37.872]  It's Texas Education Service Center's Curriculum Collaborator, TESCCC.
[00:18:37.952 --> 00:18:39.073]  They own CSCO.
[00:18:39.414 --> 00:18:42.998]  And it's the directors of all the 20 education service centers in Texas.
[00:18:43.539 --> 00:18:48.885]  Once they realized who my mom was, they drove up to Marlon from Austin to meet her.
[00:18:48.945 --> 00:18:50.107]  And I attended that meeting.
[00:18:52.802 --> 00:18:59.627]  I presented the PowerPoint presentation to Wade LaValle, who is the Seascope Director for the state, and he said, that's not in there.
[00:18:59.707 --> 00:19:00.767]  I said, well, yes, it is.
[00:19:01.408 --> 00:19:03.449]  And two days later, he pulled it off.
[00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:06.551]  And that's sort of the way it's been going.
[00:19:06.911 --> 00:19:08.212]  That was my initial finding.
[00:19:08.252 --> 00:19:17.198]  The lesson that went along with that PowerPoint actually instructs the students, and I still have a copy of it, to hand out the verses of the Koran to the students and to go over it.
[00:19:18.279 --> 00:19:21.881]  I have found lessons on the Boston Tea Party being a terrorist act.
[00:19:23.222 --> 00:19:29.066]  Yeah, let's talk about that one a little bit, because I saw that on your website, and that's kind of interesting.
[00:19:29.106 --> 00:19:30.087]  Tell us a little bit about that.
[00:19:30.867 --> 00:19:34.070]  Well, it was a lesson last year also that they've since pulled off.
[00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:38.653]  The lesson was on terrorism, and they gave a scenario.
[00:19:38.733 --> 00:19:49.060]  You read a story to the kids, and then the children would try to decide, or the students would try to decide when or where was this activity, and it was in reference to our Boston Tea Party.
[00:19:50.563 --> 00:19:52.484]  Yeah, I have an excerpt from that here.
[00:19:53.245 --> 00:19:55.707]  And basically it's set up as a news report.
[00:19:55.727 --> 00:19:56.908]  This is from your site, actually.
[00:19:57.288 --> 00:20:03.554]  It says, a local militia believed to be a terrorist organization attacked the property of private citizens today at the port.
[00:20:03.894 --> 00:20:07.497]  Then it goes on further down to say the terrorists dressed as natives.
[00:20:07.537 --> 00:20:08.918]  So first they were believed to be terrorists.
[00:20:09.279 --> 00:20:11.180]  Then they identified them and called them terrorists.
[00:20:11.541 --> 00:20:17.646]  So they were dressed as natives, apparently intoxicated, were able to escape into the night with the help of local citizens and so forth and so on.
[00:20:18.146 --> 00:20:19.628]  So, yeah, that's kind of interesting.
[00:20:19.648 --> 00:20:24.334]  And one of the things I find interesting about this is that...
[00:20:25.305 --> 00:20:29.108]  They're not really giving them any context or any education for this.
[00:20:29.208 --> 00:20:31.969]  Instead, they're throwing this out there in the current context.
[00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:40.035]  And, you know, for us, one of the things that Seascope defended it saying, well, you have to look at this in context.
[00:20:40.075 --> 00:20:51.983]  Well, to me, the proper context for this is the war on terror and things that we've seen, like the MIAC report that identify people who talk about the Constitution, people who are libertarians, conservatives, identifies them as terrorists.
[00:20:52.623 --> 00:21:04.796]  So when you've got government putting out reports identifying people like the people that were the Boston Tea Party as terrorists, and then they have these kind of lessons in the school, to me that's the greater context.
[00:21:05.596 --> 00:21:06.277]  That's exactly right.
[00:21:06.297 --> 00:21:11.663]  Like Senator Taylor said in the Education Committee a couple of weeks ago, this was an act of protest.
[00:21:11.683 --> 00:21:13.585]  This was not a terrorist attack.
[00:21:14.145 --> 00:21:14.586]  Exactly.
[00:21:15.777 --> 00:21:17.539]  They don't teach in Seascope.
[00:21:17.639 --> 00:21:20.402]  Seascope has no absolute truth.
[00:21:20.883 --> 00:21:23.907]  They will put something out there and the children discuss everything.
[00:21:24.047 --> 00:21:24.768]  It's a discussion.
[00:21:24.808 --> 00:21:25.829]  What do y'all think about this?
[00:21:25.869 --> 00:21:26.790]  What do y'all think about this?
[00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:31.997]  Should the Second Amendment be a collective right or is it an individual right?
[00:21:32.197 --> 00:21:33.278]  There's no teaching.
[00:21:33.398 --> 00:21:33.679]  It's just...
[00:21:34.199 --> 00:21:34.439]  Right.
[00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:44.130]  Well, you know, getting back to context again, how are children supposed to make these kinds of decisions when they don't have any factual information or any context in which to put that?
[00:21:44.451 --> 00:21:48.195]  But it's even worse than that, because like you said, there's this kind of moral relativism.
[00:21:49.036 --> 00:21:49.836]  Postmodernism.
[00:21:49.896 --> 00:21:55.758]  Basically, they're trying to separate the children from the notion that there is any absolute truth.
[00:21:55.778 --> 00:21:58.158]  And they're trying to separate the children from facts.
[00:21:58.539 --> 00:22:02.900]  And then that just makes the children, as they grow older, it makes them malleable.
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:07.661]  When I'm looking at this report, the last thing at the bottom of this Paul Revere thing
[00:22:08.684 --> 00:22:14.187]  The final activity is to create a class definition for terrorists.
[00:22:14.287 --> 00:22:16.088]  So it's totally subjective.
[00:22:16.128 --> 00:22:17.669]  There's nothing objective here at all.
[00:22:17.929 --> 00:22:23.633]  It reminds me, are you familiar with Agenda 21 and the Delphi Technique that they use in the Sustainable Development Meetings?
[00:22:24.213 --> 00:22:24.714]  Very.
[00:22:24.914 --> 00:22:28.037]  CSCOPE is Agenda 21 from K through 12.
[00:22:28.297 --> 00:22:28.997]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:22:29.298 --> 00:22:40.548]  And just like they go into these sustainable meetings and they want to, they invite the public into these sustainable meetings and say, we're going to discuss, you know, what we as a community could do to make things sustainable or whatever.
[00:22:41.628 --> 00:22:54.651]  They've already got their answers that they want, and they sat there with this phony discussion, manipulating the discussion, so that once it's finished, everybody feels like they came up with the definition, and they didn't come up with a definition at all.
[00:22:54.731 --> 00:22:58.812]  It was something that was already pre-decided, pre-arranged, and everybody was manipulated into it.
[00:22:59.132 --> 00:23:02.553]  Something called the Delphi Technique that was created by the Rand Corporation.
[00:23:03.115 --> 00:23:04.036]  Exactly.
[00:23:04.076 --> 00:23:06.337]  And matter of fact, our schools are doing that now in Texas.
[00:23:06.377 --> 00:23:07.798]  I went to Anderson ISD.
[00:23:07.818 --> 00:23:13.222]  There's this new vision thing that the Texas schools are doing, which Seascope's all tied into it.
[00:23:13.622 --> 00:23:17.145]  And it was the Delphi technique at Anderson ISD, Independent School District.
[00:23:17.185 --> 00:23:22.308]  They had a community meeting, and it was the... I've been to them before, so I knew what I was going to walk in on.
[00:23:22.368 --> 00:23:23.849]  And sure enough, that's what it was.
[00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:29.053]  And, um... Well, what is it that you... I'm sorry, what is it that you have people doing now?
[00:23:29.073 --> 00:23:30.834]  Do you have some kind of a call to action here in Texas?
[00:23:30.854 --> 00:23:32.075]  What are you trying to get parents to do?
[00:23:32.355 --> 00:23:38.197]  Well, right now we still see Steve Toth, House Representative Steve Toth, a new freshman, a great guy.
[00:23:38.297 --> 00:23:48.760]  He has got House Bill 760 that will put CSCOPE underneath the review of the State Board of Education and we're pushing for our House representatives to do that.
[00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:55.742]  We're also asking Senator Patrick to please help us get through that, I mean, get that through, I think, through the committee, through the Education
[00:23:55.802 --> 00:23:56.082]  Oh yeah?
[00:24:13.014 --> 00:24:34.106]  Well, I guess one of the things that I find disturbing about it is that, you know, this is something that, because it is set up to help people with tests, it looks like it's something that, you know, whenever you promote something, it's helping students pass the test, as a way to manipulate the curriculum, not only for the government schools, but also for private schools, even homeschoolers.
[00:24:34.146 --> 00:24:35.007]  Do you see that happening?
[00:24:35.987 --> 00:24:57.858]  I don't see it so much with the homeschool, and I was fortunate enough to homeschool my two children, which are grown now, but I have noticed that some of the private schools have bought this, some of the Christian schools, but I really think that they've bought it innocently because the education service centers are pushing it as this wonderful thing that meets with the Texas Teaks, and I think some of them have purchased it on accident.
[00:24:58.238 --> 00:25:01.521]  Well, as long as a few public schools, but not very many.
[00:25:01.581 --> 00:25:03.363]  Some of the superintendents are in on this.
[00:25:03.723 --> 00:25:05.825]  I haven't quite figured out how, but they are.
[00:25:05.845 --> 00:25:08.847]  Well, as you mentioned, you homeschooled your children.
[00:25:08.907 --> 00:25:09.968]  I homeschooled my children.
[00:25:09.988 --> 00:25:15.633]  One of the reasons we did that was because we're aware that from the very early foundations of government education in this country,
[00:25:16.153 --> 00:25:21.556]  With John Dewey and Horseman and people like that, they very clearly stated that it was about social engineering.
[00:25:21.596 --> 00:25:32.061]  And if you go all the way back to Plato's Republic, it was all about, you know, having compulsory tax-funded schools so the government could educate and control the children.
[00:25:32.301 --> 00:25:39.204]  We even see this with Obama's push last night in his State of the Union, where he's wanting to get more children into grades 3 and 4.
[00:25:40.846 --> 00:25:42.867]  Preschooled, I should say, at the age of three or four.
[00:25:43.228 --> 00:25:53.337]  So, you know, it's the sort of thing where they don't come at you initially necessarily as a mandate, and they're not mandating this for private schools, but there's this incentive, there's this carrot and the stick.
[00:25:53.357 --> 00:26:00.164]  You want your children to do well in the standardized tests, and of course the standardized tests are going to be set up for whatever this curriculum is that they're pushing.
[00:26:00.584 --> 00:26:10.315]  So it's an instrument of control that goes out there and they offer this preschool to parents who are having difficulty providing child care because they're struggling economically.
[00:26:10.355 --> 00:26:14.419]  So they put them in this and that gives them control of the children at a very early age.
[00:26:14.439 --> 00:26:15.520]  It's something very insidious.
[00:26:16.221 --> 00:26:16.902]  I know.
[00:26:17.222 --> 00:26:25.190]  I went to a meeting on Monday night in Huntsville and they mentioned that they have a school there strictly for three and four year olds.
[00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:27.452]  I'm like, are we running a government daycare now?
[00:26:28.193 --> 00:26:29.454]  Right.
[00:26:29.675 --> 00:26:31.376]  Well, if you go back, Plato wanted
[00:26:32.237 --> 00:26:42.480]  He wanted to destroy the family and he wanted women as well as children to be community property because he wanted everyone to see the government as their father or as their uncle, right?
[00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:53.344]  So, you know, this is where I think a lot of the attacks on the family, which are coming through curricula like this, that you see is post-modern, is anti-family, is anti-Christianity.
[00:26:53.624 --> 00:27:00.386]  So you see this type of stuff trying to tear down any moral absolutes, trying to tear down any family connections that people have.
[00:27:00.847 --> 00:27:04.695]  Making everyone essentially a ward of the state, a dependent of the state.
[00:27:05.216 --> 00:27:06.680]  It's a very serious thing.
[00:27:08.286 --> 00:27:11.127]  Exactly, and I'm just hoping that more people come in.
[00:27:11.267 --> 00:27:15.029]  Because the newspapers, our newspapers, local newspapers, they will not carry it.
[00:27:15.169 --> 00:27:19.231]  Very few media outlets that we have will pick up the story and run with it.
[00:27:19.271 --> 00:27:20.532]  I have tried so hard.
[00:27:20.852 --> 00:27:23.213]  Even pastors, I can't get the pastors involved.
[00:27:23.753 --> 00:27:32.537]  It's just very disturbing to me that people are not waking up and you've tried to find a means to let people know and it's very hard.
[00:27:32.837 --> 00:27:34.038]  But thank you for doing that.
[00:27:34.758 --> 00:27:40.266]  Well, you have a website, it's CscopeReview.com.
[00:27:40.407 --> 00:27:42.971]  T-X-CscopeReview.com.
[00:27:43.712 --> 00:27:45.755]  And what is your other website?
[00:27:45.775 --> 00:27:46.176]  You have two.
[00:27:46.914 --> 00:27:49.055]  RedHotConservative.com.
[00:27:49.315 --> 00:27:49.556]  Good.
[00:27:49.936 --> 00:27:54.558]  Well, I would suggest people go there, get more information about CSCOPE, and see what's happening in their schools.
[00:27:55.159 --> 00:28:03.283]  Parents need to be involved, but they also need to realize that the government is not really all that interested in their involvement, and not very welcoming to that involvement.
[00:28:03.323 --> 00:28:12.849]  So, you know, people need to understand what the whole purpose of government education is, and consider whether they want to try to get their kids into a private school, or homeschool them, or something to get them out of that environment.
[00:28:13.089 --> 00:28:15.350]  This is something that affects Texas.
[00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:17.131]  It's very widespread in Texas.
[00:28:17.632 --> 00:28:23.315]  And because Texas is one of these bellwether states as far as curriculum goes, this is something that could affect people nationwide.
[00:28:23.959 --> 00:28:25.560]  Yeah, and I just have one more thing to say.
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:28.381]  We have two representatives on the State Board of Education.
[00:28:29.001 --> 00:28:31.643]  Thomas Ratliff and Patricia Hardy.
[00:28:32.183 --> 00:28:34.184]  They ran on a Republican ticket.
[00:28:34.704 --> 00:28:38.105]  They are totally for CSCOPE in this Marxist curriculum.
[00:28:39.566 --> 00:28:41.467]  Don't let the R in front of their name fool you.
[00:28:41.887 --> 00:28:43.688]  Well, yeah, we see that over and over again.
[00:28:44.128 --> 00:28:46.549]  So thank you for staying on this and for educating people.
[00:28:46.649 --> 00:28:52.092]  And again, if anybody wants to get some more information about that, that's TXCSCOPEreview.org.
[00:28:52.788 --> 00:28:53.690]  Thecorrect.com.
[00:28:55.132 --> 00:28:56.153]  Thank you very much, Ginger.
[00:28:56.674 --> 00:28:56.995]  Thank you.
[00:28:57.015 --> 00:28:57.536]  Have a good day.
[00:29:00.239 --> 00:29:08.303]  Well, as I said at the beginning, we do have a book from Charlotte Isserby, an insider with the Department of Education, The Deliberate Dumbing Down of America.
[00:29:08.323 --> 00:29:12.224]  If you want to know more about this topic, she explores it in a great deal of depth.
[00:29:12.745 --> 00:29:17.887]  And you can also pair that with an excellent documentary about schools called Indoctrination.
[00:29:18.387 --> 00:29:19.388]  So you get that two-pack.
[00:29:19.448 --> 00:29:26.631]  It's something, if you have children in school or you care about the state of this country, you owe it to yourself and others to know what's going on with government schools.
[00:29:27.251 --> 00:29:29.672]  It's not about education, it's about indoctrination.
[00:29:30.072 --> 00:29:31.833]  Always has been, always will be.
[00:29:32.153 --> 00:29:39.057]  Going all the way back to Plato, but it is explicitly talked about by the founders of American education, Horseman, Thomas Dewey.
[00:29:39.837 --> 00:29:41.178]  They laid it out there for you.
[00:29:41.218 --> 00:29:43.599]  If you do the investigation, you'll understand what it's about.
[00:29:44.639 --> 00:29:54.444]  Well, that's it for our news broadcast tonight, but coming up after the credits, we have a special report from Alex, where he explores evidence of us living in a computer simulation, or something like that.
[00:29:54.484 --> 00:29:56.225]  What I would call intelligent design.
[00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:58.466]  So that's coming up right after the credits.
[00:29:58.506 --> 00:29:58.968]  Stay tuned.
[00:30:32.455 --> 00:30:33.896]  The mysteries of the universe.
[00:30:34.676 --> 00:30:36.077]  The age-old questions.
[00:30:36.738 --> 00:30:38.659]  Where did humankind come from?
[00:30:39.379 --> 00:30:41.161]  What is our ultimate destiny?
[00:30:42.041 --> 00:30:46.064]  The answers to these fundamental questions are hiding in plain view.
[00:30:47.116 --> 00:30:48.577]  We came from the universe.
[00:30:49.378 --> 00:30:52.220]  We came from all that is creation.
[00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:53.961]  We are part of the universe.
[00:30:54.302 --> 00:30:56.924]  We come out of this creation.
[00:30:57.244 --> 00:31:01.087]  The answer to the question of our existence is wonderment.
[00:31:01.828 --> 00:31:10.515]  The planet Earth is home to our species, orbiting a standard sun, two-thirds of the way out on the spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy.
[00:31:11.115 --> 00:31:14.497]  Here you see a super galaxy, a cluster of galaxies.
[00:31:15.238 --> 00:31:17.179]  Each one of these a galaxy on its own.
[00:31:17.679 --> 00:31:19.701]  Hundreds of millions photographed by Hubble.
[00:31:20.521 --> 00:31:22.743]  And Hubble isn't even getting out of our backyard.
[00:31:23.443 --> 00:31:27.566]  We are in the middle of wonderment, the middle of incredible creation.
[00:31:28.326 --> 00:31:33.729]  Humanity has not even dreamed or the mind imagined the potential of our species.
[00:31:34.169 --> 00:31:56.482]  People say they want to travel to space as if it's some distant place when we are part of the universe living on an incredibly rich and gorgeous planet in the middle of the universe with hundreds and hundreds of billions of photographed galaxies themselves containing hundreds of billions of stars and planetary systems very similar to our own.
[00:31:57.302 --> 00:32:02.648]  Our planet is like a grain of sand at an endless beach.
[00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:10.517]  But still, despite the fact that it's so tiny, all of our species' history has taken place on this globe.
[00:32:11.278 --> 00:32:15.103]  All the kings, all the tyrants, the heroes, the families.
[00:32:16.411 --> 00:32:20.772]  The little children, the discoveries, the passions that were felt.
[00:32:21.513 --> 00:32:25.214]  All of those experiences have taken place here on this planet.
[00:32:25.854 --> 00:32:35.738]  And though our individual lives are finite, we are connected to our ancestors and their discoveries, their triumphs, their misfortunes.
[00:32:36.278 --> 00:32:40.359]  And we reach forward into the future, towards our future progeny.
[00:32:40.679 --> 00:32:45.781]  And as long as our species is not destroyed, we truly live forever.
[00:32:47.213 --> 00:32:57.659]  Of the countless species that have swum in the Earth's seas, flown in the sky, crawled across the plains, humanity is undoubtedly superior to them all.
[00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:00.781]  But that doesn't mean that we'll always be here.
[00:33:01.829 --> 00:33:11.158]  Hundreds of thousands of species have lived on this planet, sometimes for millions of years, before their species disappears, often suddenly.
[00:33:11.919 --> 00:33:18.124]  All we're left with is their fossils, snapshots, shadows of what they were.
[00:33:18.805 --> 00:33:21.908]  Look at this fantastic fossilized dinosaur skull.
[00:33:22.749 --> 00:33:25.712]  Was it the inspiration for the space jockey in Prometheus?
[00:33:27.782 --> 00:33:37.772]  Truth is, stranger than fiction, all of the thousands and thousands of fantastic species, humanity needs to understand that our existence is just as fragile.
[00:33:38.613 --> 00:33:45.840]  Scientists hotly debate whether it was a meteorite, a comet, or other outside threat that destroyed the dinosaurs.
[00:33:46.441 --> 00:33:48.943]  With humans, our main threat is ourselves.
[00:33:49.924 --> 00:33:52.487]  We've had the power to do it for more than 60 years.
[00:33:53.588 --> 00:33:57.974]  And every day we see different scientific installations having disasters.
[00:33:58.734 --> 00:34:02.018]  We are the equivalent of gods to Stone Age men.
[00:34:03.089 --> 00:34:12.314]  And we can't afford to make the mistakes they made because we will destroy ourselves with the technologies that we have developed.
[00:34:12.855 --> 00:34:15.376]  So far in our history, technology has been neutral.
[00:34:16.236 --> 00:34:20.139]  It is a promising tool that could allow us to grasp an infinite future.
[00:34:20.799 --> 00:34:26.062]  But at this time, the entire development of these systems is in the hands of the globalist.
[00:34:26.642 --> 00:34:30.965]  Super predators who have a lustful disdain and hate for humanity.
[00:34:33.294 --> 00:34:43.757]  Globalist social engineers openly talk about the population of the planet like we're little animals in Petri dishes to be manipulated, to be controlled, to be tested upon.
[00:34:44.417 --> 00:34:45.717]  Foster children and U.S.
[00:34:45.777 --> 00:34:55.200]  military personnel have had chemicals, biologicals, and radiologicals tested on them for more than 60 years because the elite believe that they're nothing but unconscious animals.
[00:34:57.589 --> 00:35:14.818]  I'm asking humanity to realize that a very small group of inbred, unhappy, twisted and wicked people have seized control of human development and are attempting to establish a total control system of technocratic surveillance and dehumanization.
[00:35:15.719 --> 00:35:22.102]  It is now that we must begin to struggle against their bureaucracy, fighting their 1984 system
[00:35:24.315 --> 00:35:35.224]  With liberty and freedom and enlightenment and truth, until the levers of technological development are leveraged from the hands of the globalist, humanity has a very dark future.
[00:35:35.925 --> 00:35:42.170]  The real threats facing humanity are not the fake environmental threats that Al Gore and the UN bring you.
[00:35:42.431 --> 00:35:45.153]  They are unchecked cross-species genetic engineering.
[00:35:45.433 --> 00:35:56.918]  Tens of thousands of biotech companies, universities and governments randomly splicing viruses, bacteria from plants and animals and then injecting them into other animals.
[00:35:57.438 --> 00:36:05.601]  This is already giving rise to mutated viruses and bacteria and a irrevocable vandalization of the genetic code of the planet.
[00:36:06.301 --> 00:36:10.223]  High-tech chemical and most importantly biological weapons development.
[00:36:10.922 --> 00:36:28.217]  Unchecked nanotech, the artificial creation of black holes, antimatter weapons that the Air Force admits they've developed, and new viral vaccines coming out that re-engineer the brain by attacking certain gangly eye systems so that you can no longer feel emotions.
[00:36:28.597 --> 00:36:35.023]  We've seen one of the biggest mutual funds, Fidelity Investments, come out and talk about synthetic biology.
[00:36:36.158 --> 00:36:41.599]  Within 50 years, we may have invented more organisms in the lab than we've identified in nature.
[00:36:41.739 --> 00:36:45.980]  It's synthetic biology, and it could be the defining technology of the 21st century.
[00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:53.481]  And how within just a few years, they're going to overwrite every major life form on this planet without asking you.
[00:36:54.101 --> 00:37:04.563]  That's a trillion times what Monsanto does, planting their crops next to yours, their crops then infect your crops, and they come and charge you with copyright infringement when they polluted your property.
[00:37:05.263 --> 00:37:07.465]  All of this is being rolled out now.
[00:37:08.066 --> 00:37:23.539]  We are under a massive and sustained offensive by the Technocratic Psychopath Guild, known as the New World Order, to fully dominate and wipe out most of humanity so they can control the next phase of our development.
[00:37:23.899 --> 00:37:27.762]  The United Nations, Ray Kurzweil, all these different transhumanists,
[00:37:29.003 --> 00:37:36.728]  Openly say that they're not giving anybody a choice, that they're going ahead in this attempt to evolve humans and merge us with machines.
[00:37:37.108 --> 00:37:42.892]  We intend to create a new vector for civilization, aimed at constant human development and evolution.
[00:37:43.072 --> 00:37:45.633]  The brain is transplanted into an avatar being.
[00:37:45.853 --> 00:37:48.415]  Man receives new, expanded life.
[00:37:48.775 --> 00:37:51.257]  The era of Neo-Humanity.
[00:37:52.037 --> 00:38:02.342]  And they believe that they know what the outcome is going to be, without even having a public discussion, they believe that they govern the future evolution, as they call it, of our species.
[00:38:03.302 --> 00:38:18.749]  That's why we're doing this news report, in the hope that people will look up from the dirt and the television programs and sitcoms and football games that don't matter, that are put there to distract you from the real world, the whole universe going on around you, so that we can have a real debate as a species about our future.
[00:38:35.172 --> 00:38:46.254]  If we don't respect our species, if we forget our ancestors and the lessons they taught us, and if we don't learn from the struggles they went through, we're not going to survive as a species.
[00:38:46.775 --> 00:38:48.155]  You see, we as humans
[00:38:49.949 --> 00:38:53.492]  Have this instinctive feeling that we've been here forever.
[00:38:54.252 --> 00:39:03.820]  When we read the writings of Plato, written more than 2,000 years ago, or William Shakespeare, 500 years ago, their words are spoken alive in our minds.
[00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:07.923]  This is communicating with people in the past.
[00:39:08.283 --> 00:39:12.787]  And like electricity, it gives us a clear connection to them and the present.
[00:39:13.717 --> 00:39:14.577]  Towards the future.
[00:39:15.318 --> 00:39:17.099]  That, my friends, is magic.
[00:39:17.799 --> 00:39:20.680]  And that's why our species is timeless.
[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:28.524]  Why have all human societies, going back thousands of years, scraped their names on tree trunks or on cave walls?
[00:39:29.264 --> 00:39:35.166]  Because there is a fundamental human need to communicate forward into the future.
[00:39:35.807 --> 00:39:46.351]  It's ingrained in us to teach those that come after us the experiences we had so that they don't relive the mistakes that we made.
[00:39:46.871 --> 00:39:50.152]  And so they will learn from the good things that we discovered.
[00:39:50.352 --> 00:39:51.573]  We communally
[00:39:52.233 --> 00:39:55.857]  Share in the knowledge that our species has developed.
[00:39:56.357 --> 00:40:06.267]  This is what's different about mankind versus all the hundreds of thousands of species that have come and gone on this planet in its ancient history.
[00:40:07.378 --> 00:40:09.540]  We are able to change our environment.
[00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:12.782]  We are able to grasp that we're finite.
[00:40:13.423 --> 00:40:22.069]  And we are able to construct systems and languages and sciences of mathematics just as we can
[00:40:23.291 --> 00:40:28.594]  Decipher the hieroglyphs in Egyptian caves and know what they were thinking 4000 years ago.
[00:40:29.214 --> 00:40:32.235]  We can go back 500 years ago to William Shakespeare.
[00:40:32.475 --> 00:40:41.780]  In Shakespeare's Hamlet, they are burying someone and accidentally dig into the grave of a man who had taken care of Hamlet when he was a child.
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:43.441]  And Hamlet
[00:40:44.469 --> 00:40:57.257]  In awe, looks at the brow ridges and the face of the skull that was his childhood babysitter, and says, I laughed at your jokes.
[00:40:57.337 --> 00:41:02.160]  You carried me on your shoulders a thousand times, and now look at you.
[00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:03.661]  You're nothing but a skull.
[00:41:04.858 --> 00:41:05.539]  How could it be?
[00:41:05.559 --> 00:41:09.262]  You were there, full of life and everything, and you're gone.
[00:41:09.282 --> 00:41:10.703]  You're gone forever.
[00:41:11.084 --> 00:41:20.212]  But he's not really gone forever, because just as William Shakespeare's words continue on, your knowledge, discoveries you make, are passed on.
[00:41:20.873 --> 00:41:22.875]  That's what's so amazing about humanity.
[00:41:23.956 --> 00:41:26.258]  We can argue all day if there's life after death.
[00:41:27.312 --> 00:41:28.133]  But I know one thing.
[00:41:28.273 --> 00:41:30.614]  We're alive and sentient right now.
[00:41:31.035 --> 00:41:35.458]  And ideas that we develop, art that we create, lives on forever.
[00:41:36.038 --> 00:41:40.221]  And even if you don't believe in God, look at the beauty and the majesty of the universe.
[00:41:40.762 --> 00:41:43.664]  The universe doesn't make junk.
[00:41:44.304 --> 00:41:46.305]  And so don't ever think you're garbage.
[00:41:46.546 --> 00:41:53.370]  Don't ever let the system make you feel insecure and hollow inside, hoping that you never advance in your hierarchy of needs.
[00:41:53.851 --> 00:41:55.112]  They want to keep you stunted.
[00:41:56.035 --> 00:41:57.836]  While they live and we sleep.
[00:41:59.437 --> 00:42:02.738]  While they are conscious, while we are in a dream state.
[00:42:03.159 --> 00:42:13.764]  The planet's social engineers openly talk about us as animals, and they see the society they've constructed as an artificial habitat, meant to keep us from ever discovering the wider, real world.
[00:42:15.871 --> 00:42:18.156]  It's time to really get outside the box.
[00:42:18.757 --> 00:42:21.844]  It's time to realize the wonder that's all around you.
[00:42:22.325 --> 00:42:25.552]  If we go back to the Greek philosopher more than 2,000 years ago, Plato,
[00:42:26.451 --> 00:42:31.816]  He wrote an allegory, or an analogy, of people chained inside a cave.
[00:42:31.836 --> 00:42:36.800]  Their only reality is images dancing on a wall, a puppet show in front of a fire.
[00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:45.027]  And one of them is able to break out and go up to the surface and sees deer, and the sun, and the moon, and the whole world, and tries to come back and warn people.
[00:42:45.287 --> 00:42:46.468]  And they say, hey, shut up!
[00:42:47.269 --> 00:42:50.452]  We've got a lot invested in this mirage.
[00:42:50.892 --> 00:42:53.995]  We want the mirage, not the real thing out there.
[00:42:55.686 --> 00:43:04.109]  It is our job to try to break people out of this matrix and to see how incredible and magical this universe and this world is.
[00:43:04.690 --> 00:43:06.450]  And to realize that we have value.
[00:43:06.770 --> 00:43:07.531]  We're special.
[00:43:07.731 --> 00:43:09.771]  What do we see through the controlled corporate media?
[00:43:10.192 --> 00:43:12.092]  That humanity's a disease.
[00:43:12.112 --> 00:43:14.593]  That the world would be better off without us.
[00:43:15.054 --> 00:43:17.955]  Too many kids are what's making the planet worse.
[00:43:18.515 --> 00:43:20.716]  Human beings are a disease.
[00:43:21.889 --> 00:43:23.530]  The cancer of this planet.
[00:43:24.010 --> 00:43:26.271]  It looks like you've got a case of the humans.
[00:43:26.831 --> 00:43:27.992]  Bad humans!
[00:43:28.392 --> 00:43:33.455]  They multiply over 300,000 a day, consuming anything that crosses their path.
[00:43:34.135 --> 00:43:44.700]  The establishment is preparing us with a psychological race consciousness memory that we're trash and that we're bad and that we shouldn't have a survival instinct.
[00:43:49.562 --> 00:43:51.243]  Earth is just the start.
[00:43:51.723 --> 00:43:53.544]  Who knows what's next?
[00:43:54.504 --> 00:44:00.267]  They are openly preparing to release biological weapons to reduce the population.
[00:44:00.968 --> 00:44:05.470]  This is the real development, not sitcoms on television.
[00:44:05.950 --> 00:44:14.034]  The real world is going on around you while you're turning your life over to a television that is literally programming you.
[00:44:14.634 --> 00:44:16.737]  Think about what the social engineers feed us.
[00:44:16.997 --> 00:44:22.905]  Every television ad, every big blockbuster film has messages crammed into it.
[00:44:23.185 --> 00:44:28.912]  You have men going and fantasizing that only Batman or the Incredible Hulk could defeat threats.
[00:44:29.353 --> 00:44:30.354]  Not the average person.
[00:44:31.155 --> 00:44:45.443]  That sports icons are all that matters, and that we're all basically garbage, and only this Madison Avenue, Hollywood system matters, when it is only a tiny part of the overall spectrum of life going on on this planet.
[00:44:46.084 --> 00:44:47.345]  And it's a facsimile.
[00:44:47.945 --> 00:44:48.985]  It's a prosthesis.
[00:44:49.566 --> 00:44:50.266]  It's a fake.
[00:44:50.787 --> 00:44:51.667]  It's a fraud.
[00:44:51.947 --> 00:44:54.709]  Consciousness is unspeakably incredible.
[00:44:56.035 --> 00:45:20.524]  The real world is an infinity more valuable and fulfilling than the fraud that is mainline television and all of these films and this dumbed down culture that seeks to keep you shuttered inside the cave to make you feel small and to make you feel like you need the images they project on the wall more than you need the real world waiting right up those steps on the surface.
[00:45:21.823 --> 00:45:29.812]  And even when you make it to the surface out of the cave, you're only here on this planet and outside of it is the larger cave and still more.
[00:45:30.173 --> 00:45:34.197]  You must leave one box and then leave another and still leave another.
[00:45:34.658 --> 00:45:36.139]  This is the human experience.
[00:45:36.179 --> 00:45:41.666]  This is the electric magic and the wonderment of consciousness and being awake.
[00:45:43.328 --> 00:45:48.655]  The doors to the universe and the things we can't even imagine are standing open to us.
[00:45:49.396 --> 00:45:55.543]  Don't let their false paradigms and false roadmaps be injected like viruses into your mind.
[00:45:56.806 --> 00:46:05.850]  The dreams of your ancestors, the dreams of the universe, the dreams of everything wholesome and good flows like living water out of the space-time continuum.
[00:46:06.570 --> 00:46:07.811]  Beauty is all around us.
[00:46:08.411 --> 00:46:10.492]  The wind in the trees in the summer.
[00:46:11.172 --> 00:46:12.052]  The sunrise.
[00:46:12.632 --> 00:46:13.373]  Moonset.
[00:46:14.033 --> 00:46:14.653]  The ocean.
[00:46:15.374 --> 00:46:16.034]  Seagulls.
[00:46:17.234 --> 00:46:24.237]  When you were a child spraying a water hose up into the sky and looking at the droplets like they were jewels in the air.
[00:46:25.138 --> 00:46:25.838]  Your children.
[00:46:27.469 --> 00:46:29.110]  Your grandmother, your grandfather.
[00:46:31.091 --> 00:46:34.934]  Feeling that first gust of autumn wind on your cheeks.
[00:46:35.674 --> 00:46:38.396]  Looking up and seeing the stars at night.
[00:46:39.297 --> 00:46:40.338]  Everything is a miracle.
[00:46:40.638 --> 00:46:42.919]  The fact that you can recognize beauty.
[00:46:43.339 --> 00:46:46.522]  The fact that you know when something is wholesome and good.
[00:46:47.469 --> 00:46:52.951]  Shows that you recognize what is beautiful and wholesome in the universe.
[00:46:53.531 --> 00:46:55.191]  You resonate with the good.
[00:46:55.571 --> 00:46:57.152]  You recoil from the bad.
[00:46:57.612 --> 00:47:09.275]  And because the bad seizes control of the power structures, so that it can unnaturally thrive and operate, you pull back saying, oh, I don't want to go there.
[00:47:09.335 --> 00:47:10.475]  I don't want to resist them.
[00:47:11.476 --> 00:47:16.617]  But by doing that, you turn the world and the universe over to evil.
[00:47:17.668 --> 00:47:24.210]  We cannot allow the planet Earth to become a beachhead of the satanic forces that have bred here.
[00:47:25.370 --> 00:47:27.571]  For every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction.
[00:47:27.931 --> 00:47:34.973]  And there is incredible beauty and creation and power and mission and destiny on this planet.
[00:47:35.153 --> 00:47:36.313]  This is an amazing place.
[00:47:37.053 --> 00:47:39.954]  And that's why the forces of evil are here as well.
[00:47:40.554 --> 00:47:43.315]  And we are in a struggle, not just for this planet,
[00:47:44.821 --> 00:47:49.923]  But in the universe around us, think how far humanity has come in the last 6,000 years.
[00:47:50.383 --> 00:47:51.704]  Think of where we could go.
[00:47:52.004 --> 00:47:57.266]  As the Bible says, the ear has not heard, the eye has not seen what is in store for us.
[00:47:58.447 --> 00:48:01.908]  We are at the jump point for our civilization, for our species.
[00:48:02.428 --> 00:48:08.151]  Everything we do now will govern the future of human development forever.
[00:48:08.731 --> 00:48:11.312]  Humanity is only in an embryonic phase now.
[00:48:11.412 --> 00:48:17.694]  If we're able to continue our development, we are made in the image of the creator of the universe.
[00:48:18.294 --> 00:48:19.735]  We are creators.
[00:48:20.535 --> 00:48:33.089]  We are powerful, but now we've got to face the predators of our own species and the computers we've created in the final battle to decide if humanity will move to the next level.
[00:48:33.349 --> 00:48:34.811]  A Type 1 civilization.
[00:48:35.211 --> 00:48:36.733]  And what is a Type 1 civilization?
[00:48:38.413 --> 00:48:42.376]  A Type 1 civilization can survive even if its home world is destroyed.
[00:48:42.856 --> 00:48:47.300]  That should be the prime goal of Homo Sapien Sapien.
[00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:53.124]  What do you think your ancestors, if they could look into our dimension and our time today, would want?
[00:48:53.405 --> 00:48:57.388]  They would want us to survive and thrive and move into the future.
[00:48:58.527 --> 00:49:04.851]  That's all past generations wanted was for their children and progeny and their clan to live.
[00:49:05.331 --> 00:49:07.492]  That's the basic human imperative.
[00:49:08.113 --> 00:49:15.157]  And to do that, you've got to develop technologies, you've got to be passionate, you've got to be truthful, you've got to build, you've got to be strong.
[00:49:15.617 --> 00:49:18.839]  That is the launch pad for the next level of human development.
[00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:20.801]  So that's the question.
[00:49:20.921 --> 00:49:22.522]  Will we become extinct?
[00:49:23.402 --> 00:49:24.563]  Like so many other species?
[00:49:27.110 --> 00:49:27.971]  We can go to space.
[00:49:28.031 --> 00:49:29.812]  We can create computers.
[00:49:30.433 --> 00:49:32.234]  We can theorize quantum mechanics.
[00:49:33.475 --> 00:49:34.696]  Picasso, Beethoven.
[00:49:35.517 --> 00:49:38.439]  Can we take control of our destiny?
[00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:42.383]  Can we have a species-wide debate about our system?
[00:49:43.483 --> 00:49:48.708]  Or is death of humankind all that's waiting in our future?
[00:49:49.789 --> 00:49:53.632]  That decision, to a great extent, depends on you.
[00:49:54.352 --> 00:49:56.154]  So the ball is in your court.
