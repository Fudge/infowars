[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:00.309]  Coast to Coast.
[00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:00.809]  Direct from Austin.
[00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:03.010]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:00:32.523 --> 00:00:33.144]  Big Brother.
[00:00:33.824 --> 00:00:34.845]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:35.586 --> 00:00:36.726]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:37.347 --> 00:00:38.168]  You want answers?
[00:00:38.928 --> 00:00:39.809]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.132]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:44.673 --> 00:00:48.756]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:12.482]  All right, V in Nevada, ahead of Ron Paul joining us, then we'll go to Jody and Wesley and Jim and Mike and everybody else that's holding.
[00:01:13.302 --> 00:01:19.624]  Yeah, I remember seeing this months ago that no one's seen Nelson Mandela, no one was allowed to go in and see him.
[00:01:20.424 --> 00:01:25.465]  There was a big debate about whether he was alive or not, and they do this a lot when famous world leaders die.
[00:01:25.865 --> 00:01:28.766]  The Soviets would do this, and these are communists, so they act the same.
[00:01:29.226 --> 00:01:31.647]  They would hide the fact that they'd been dead for a while.
[00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:37.919]  You also saw speculation that Castro's been dead a bunch too, so it doesn't always mean that.
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.288]  But I saw this last week and this week, I did see it in foreign press that
[00:01:44.096 --> 00:01:54.561]  Family had been demanding to see him, others had been demanding to see him, and then it was that they couldn't cover it up anymore, so they just suddenly announced he passed in the night, no details of why.
[00:01:55.301 --> 00:01:59.884]  And just the pieces I've got on the way communists operate, they follow a handbook.
[00:02:01.424 --> 00:02:05.586]  You have the article here out of your local paper, and it's got basically the same stuff I'd seen.
[00:02:06.487 --> 00:02:07.807]  I'm glad you raised this.
[00:02:08.027 --> 00:02:13.030]  So tell folks what the article's about, and we're going to get it linked up on Infowars.com right now.
[00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:14.090]  You bet.
[00:02:14.191 --> 00:02:14.671]  You bet.
[00:02:14.731 --> 00:02:18.914]  And I could not be prouder to be handing it to Alex Jones himself, sir.
[00:02:19.294 --> 00:02:19.955]  Check this out.
[00:02:20.815 --> 00:02:26.039]  Reading into the article, the young woman has come under fire here, too, in other local news.
[00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:27.120]  I've been looking into it.
[00:02:28.201 --> 00:02:31.463]  They had a denial-of-service attack.
[00:02:31.864 --> 00:02:34.726]  They had a denial-of-service attack perpetrated on them like
[00:02:35.623 --> 00:02:40.126]  Probably the same day that they tried to break this news.
[00:02:40.206 --> 00:02:43.309]  That entire news website was shut down for three days.
[00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:45.751]  Now I know the Guardian Express.
[00:02:45.811 --> 00:02:47.212]  It seems like a pretty good publication.
[00:02:47.232 --> 00:02:48.192]  Go ahead.
[00:02:48.292 --> 00:02:49.133]  They're pretty good.
[00:02:49.193 --> 00:02:51.835]  You know, they break some kind of juicy stuff.
[00:02:51.875 --> 00:02:53.096]  You know, I'm an info hound, man.
[00:02:53.136 --> 00:02:57.179]  I'm going to look for the truth.
[00:02:57.339 --> 00:03:01.222]  But, they traced the denial of service attack back to South Africa.
[00:03:01.422 --> 00:03:02.203]  There is your
[00:03:03.067 --> 00:03:05.588]  Caramelizer, your crystallizer.
[00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:13.172]  This is probably one of the single most capped and covered news stories ever.
[00:03:13.232 --> 00:03:15.073]  Now, I've been digging.
[00:03:16.714 --> 00:03:21.997]  For some reason or another, right after Obama showed up there is when the machine will shut off.
[00:03:22.037 --> 00:03:27.300]  Now, if you look in this article, it says that the family was debating over some kind of
[00:03:28.303 --> 00:03:28.644]  I think?
[00:03:40.263 --> 00:03:44.906]  Have these sorts of legal proceedings over in the state and stuff if a person is dead.
[00:03:45.166 --> 00:03:53.450]  So they've basically been pumping air into a corpse in order to keep him alive so that the judicial... I'm sorry, oh god, this sounds terrible.
[00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.892]  So that the legal proceedings could, you know, continue.
[00:03:56.932 --> 00:03:59.593]  They can continue to fight over, you know, what's going on.
[00:03:59.693 --> 00:04:01.014]  I don't know what happened,
[00:04:01.861 --> 00:04:12.276]  Once Obama showed up, okay, and now he's been, you know, supposedly the life support's been turned off or whatnot, me and my sister are very passionate about this kind of thing.
[00:04:12.897 --> 00:04:15.941]  And she found even that they had the casket.
[00:04:17.066 --> 00:04:28.311]  They just recently put the casket out in public, and I will bet you every gun in my arsenal, and I love my guns, that they've got people out there walking around in empty caskets.
[00:04:28.591 --> 00:04:31.772]  I promise you, Mandela's been dead for about six months probably.
[00:04:32.093 --> 00:04:35.554]  And the fact that this site was attacked, you know how these globalists work, you know.
[00:04:36.434 --> 00:04:41.096]  Whenever something's on the level and it's going to inform people, they come out and get it.
[00:04:41.337 --> 00:04:44.298]  So, the denial of service is traced back to South Africa.
[00:04:45.618 --> 00:04:48.444]  I really just want to have you completely read that article.
[00:04:48.684 --> 00:04:49.786]  I want Alex Jones.
[00:04:49.967 --> 00:04:50.748]  Do me the honor.
[00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:51.830]  Read that article.
[00:04:54.673 --> 00:04:56.434]  Hearing about people saying, where is he?
[00:04:56.474 --> 00:04:58.155]  He's dead, in a controversy in South Africa.
[00:04:58.456 --> 00:04:59.576]  People can pull those articles up.
[00:04:59.636 --> 00:05:01.077]  Watson or somebody could do an article about this.
[00:05:01.398 --> 00:05:03.959]  So that was definitely a controversy, and then they just finally said he was dead.
[00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:08.782]  And people will do this so that they can continue to operate and sign his name and do things.
[00:05:08.842 --> 00:05:11.644]  I mean, this sounds like how a bunch of murdering communists would operate.
[00:05:11.684 --> 00:05:13.125]  So, standard procedure.
[00:05:13.145 --> 00:05:15.007]  Thank you very much for reminding us of that story.
[00:05:15.427 --> 00:05:16.347]  We'll look into it.
[00:05:16.408 --> 00:05:17.308]  Very, very interesting.
[00:05:17.668 --> 00:05:20.350]  Alright, former Congressman Ron Paul is scheduled to be joining us.
[00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:24.193]  Coming up, all this and more, straight ahead, InfoWars.com.
[00:05:24.633 --> 00:05:24.717]  Yeah.
[00:05:29.807 --> 00:05:40.194]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[00:05:40.494 --> 00:05:42.355]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[00:05:42.556 --> 00:05:43.236]  Fluoride!
[00:05:43.436 --> 00:05:45.017]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:45.357 --> 00:05:51.682]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[00:05:51.942 --> 00:05:56.745]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[00:05:56.865 --> 00:05:59.567]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase.
[00:05:59.887 --> 00:06:00.407]  We're good.
[00:06:28.748 --> 00:06:38.739]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:06:38.799 --> 00:06:46.928]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:06:47.208 --> 00:06:51.912]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:06:52.092 --> 00:06:58.797]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:06:58.877 --> 00:07:05.963]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:07:06.063 --> 00:07:07.824]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee.
[00:07:07.944 --> 00:07:12.910]  And it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:17.435]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:07:17.555 --> 00:07:20.819]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:07:20.959 --> 00:07:27.086]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:07:27.266 --> 00:07:27.727]  Available!
[00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:30.551]  The facts are in.
[00:07:30.711 --> 00:07:31.832]  The studies are legion.
[00:07:32.113 --> 00:07:39.483]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[00:07:39.643 --> 00:07:43.088]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[00:07:43.448 --> 00:07:43.848]  Simple.
[00:07:44.009 --> 00:07:48.472]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[00:07:48.752 --> 00:07:54.216]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[00:07:54.456 --> 00:08:10.468]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield Formulation, fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[00:08:10.768 --> 00:08:15.030]  Let's take a stand against the Globalist by blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.
[00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:17.191]  I use Fluoride Shield every day.
[00:08:17.511 --> 00:08:22.814]  Secure your Fluoride Shield and other pioneering formulations at InfoWarsLife.com today.
[00:08:23.074 --> 00:08:27.316]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the InfoWar at the same time.
[00:08:27.476 --> 00:08:28.757]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:08:34.724 --> 00:08:35.364]  Big Brother.
[00:08:36.045 --> 00:08:37.065]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:37.806 --> 00:08:38.907]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:39.567 --> 00:08:40.367]  You want answers?
[00:08:41.148 --> 00:08:42.008]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:42.689 --> 00:08:46.331]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:46.891 --> 00:08:50.954]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:09:08.188 --> 00:09:12.232]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this Friday edition.
[00:09:13.072 --> 00:09:14.474]  We are now into the second hour.
[00:09:14.534 --> 00:09:28.547]  We have a guest that we're getting hooked up on Skype right now who's an expert on the technotronic technocracy age, the governing system that the globalists actually describe themselves as being adherents of.
[00:09:29.167 --> 00:09:32.968]  And this is a system they're trying to set up, so that's coming up here in a few minutes.
[00:09:33.969 --> 00:09:40.551]  First off, Congressman McDermott is saying he hasn't seen this much panic on the floor since 9-11.
[00:09:41.171 --> 00:09:47.334]  House Democrat compares congressional panic over Obamacare to worst terror attack in nation's history.
[00:09:47.934 --> 00:09:53.216]  Well yeah, that manufactured globalist event killed 3,000 people and was tragic.
[00:09:53.676 --> 00:09:56.277]  And then thousands more from the deadly dust the government lied about.
[00:09:56.837 --> 00:10:05.199]  But this is going to kill the economy and the engine of prosperity and kill millions through death panels and ration care on record.
[00:10:07.079 --> 00:10:10.620]  I mean, we knew what was in the bill, we knew the plan, and now, get ready.
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:13.461]  Get ready to become impoverished.
[00:10:14.221 --> 00:10:26.244]  Because they want you impoverished under Cloward and Piven to give up on the free market, blame capitalism for crony fraud capitalism that they brought in, where they socialize our lives, but then transfer the wealth to themselves.
[00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:30.171]  So, that is just some of the news.
[00:10:30.591 --> 00:10:37.114]  Also, CBS is reporting that a TSA agent officer bled for 33 minutes in LAX shooting.
[00:10:38.514 --> 00:10:47.738]  Airports are supposed to be the most secure places in the country, except for like military bases, and then this guy bled for 33 minutes while they got the SWAT team all suited up and ready.
[00:10:48.178 --> 00:10:56.401]  Again, it's the culture of just worrying about their safety all day, until the point is nobody's safe because a nanny state can do nothing but make you domesticated.
[00:10:58.078 --> 00:11:06.684]  A nanny state can do nothing except basically turn you into a sheep.
[00:11:09.987 --> 00:11:11.088]  It's so simple.
[00:11:12.269 --> 00:11:16.031]  And then we've got the other news up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:11:17.733 --> 00:11:21.796]  Reports out Obama is an actor trained by Harry Lennox.
[00:11:22.016 --> 00:11:23.557]  This is a big deal if this goes viral.
[00:11:24.707 --> 00:11:40.173]  That Harry Lennox is saying, and it's on record they were friends for about 17 years, and that they had done work together and they'd go to each other's houses and now he reportedly says Obama's horrible and is a rat.
[00:11:40.613 --> 00:11:41.354]  That's another quote.
[00:11:42.254 --> 00:11:42.794]  A rat.
[00:11:44.235 --> 00:11:49.357]  And that Obama was trained by him to be presidential.
[00:11:50.097 --> 00:11:51.118]  And then of course if you watch
[00:11:52.313 --> 00:11:53.575]  Uh, Harry Lennox to an interview.
[00:11:53.736 --> 00:11:54.357]  It's Obama.
[00:11:54.397 --> 00:11:55.959]  The same cadence, the same voice.
[00:11:58.183 --> 00:12:01.724]  Obama is copying Lennox, or Lennox is copying Obama.
[00:12:02.384 --> 00:12:03.605]  It's like the same guy.
[00:12:03.945 --> 00:12:11.307]  And I believe Lennox over Obama, so that article and the source on that is up on Infowars.com right now.
[00:12:12.007 --> 00:12:15.909]  Also, again, the Federal Reserve is planning to accelerate money printing.
[00:12:16.349 --> 00:12:23.271]  Congressman warns of Obama creating secret security force, armed security force, that's actually in the Obamacare bill.
[00:12:23.931 --> 00:12:26.394]  And then the media is like, oh, he would never do that.
[00:12:26.634 --> 00:12:30.998]  They've already set it up with mercenaries with top security clearances guarding federal buildings now.
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:35.182]  And then the billions of bullets and all the training and the rest of it.
[00:12:35.202 --> 00:12:38.326]  I mean, this is just simply, simply amazing.
[00:12:39.269 --> 00:12:41.330]  And then some of the other news.
[00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:46.052]  Countdown US hits debt ceiling in 84 days.
[00:12:46.872 --> 00:12:49.774]  And again, Obama said raising the debt does not raise the debt.
[00:12:49.974 --> 00:12:51.114]  Only not raising it.
[00:12:51.474 --> 00:12:55.676]  That's the only thing that is financially irresponsible.
[00:12:57.577 --> 00:13:00.458]  We have a bigger debt than we have yearly GDP.
[00:13:00.578 --> 00:13:06.301]  We have a higher debt to savings ratio than Spain and Greece that are both completely bankrupt.
[00:13:07.168 --> 00:13:09.013]  And their answer is, get us deeper into debt.
[00:13:09.114 --> 00:13:09.595]  Why not?
[00:13:09.635 --> 00:13:11.279]  The globalists want us impoverished.
[00:13:12.302 --> 00:13:15.711]  And if Rand Paul wants to cut the defense budget, he's a traitor.
[00:13:16.801 --> 00:13:24.563]  And if Ted Cruz wants to cut some of the corporate welfare and entitlement welfare, oh, he's a horrible person.
[00:13:25.084 --> 00:13:32.166]  You can't continue to do this and have 101 million people on food assistance and 100 plus million people on government dole.
[00:13:32.986 --> 00:13:35.587]  There's more people on the dole now than in the workforce.
[00:13:36.087 --> 00:13:37.167]  Let me say that again.
[00:13:37.627 --> 00:13:40.028]  What about the people going bankrupt everywhere?
[00:13:40.728 --> 00:13:42.589]  What about the people losing their houses?
[00:13:43.882 --> 00:13:46.943]  Well, the folks that have been not working for five, ten years, they go, I don't care!
[00:13:48.304 --> 00:13:49.144]  Tax the rich!
[00:13:49.244 --> 00:13:54.846]  It's the ultra-rich lobbying for that, against the middle class, their historic enemy, to bankrupt the country.
[00:13:55.247 --> 00:13:57.728]  Once they've done that, you're all going to have your welfare taken away.
[00:13:59.068 --> 00:14:01.769]  Here's an article, China to ease one-child policy.
[00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:12.894]  That's because it's caused such a problem, having upwards of, what is it, 60, 70 more million men than they have women.
[00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:16.511]  And it's causing all sorts of societal problems.
[00:14:17.731 --> 00:14:20.072]  And India is about to outstrip them in population.
[00:14:20.112 --> 00:14:22.433]  And they've ended the labor camps.
[00:14:22.953 --> 00:14:24.393]  That's being reported by Reuters.
[00:14:24.993 --> 00:14:27.154]  China unveils boldest reforms in decades.
[00:14:28.515 --> 00:14:30.455]  Shows that the new president is in command.
[00:14:30.475 --> 00:14:32.476]  Folks, they don't need labor camps anymore.
[00:14:32.736 --> 00:14:34.356]  Because they call them jobs.
[00:14:34.797 --> 00:14:38.178]  And you go in their suicide nets and they force drug you and forced abortion.
[00:14:38.698 --> 00:14:40.438]  And you're basically locked up at night.
[00:14:40.678 --> 00:14:42.359]  And they just don't call it labor camps.
[00:14:45.273 --> 00:14:51.535]  And don't worry, China is now on the UN Human Rights Board, deciding what's human rights, along with Cuba.
[00:14:51.555 --> 00:14:54.135]  Along with Cuba, oh, but it gets better.
[00:14:54.295 --> 00:14:58.116]  Saudi Arabia is probably a bigger tyranny than China, per capita.
[00:14:59.216 --> 00:15:05.358]  The only thing worse is North Korea, and I expect them to be made, you know, the head of the UN operation.
[00:15:05.378 --> 00:15:10.019]  So, that's just some of the news, up on Infowars.com, up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:15:10.879 --> 00:15:14.040]  EPA blocks cities from installing fire hydrants.
[00:15:15.598 --> 00:15:19.281]  Again, the EPA shutting down over 500 power plants.
[00:15:19.321 --> 00:15:32.653]  Bloomberg reports Philadelphia has 119 fire hydrants that cost about $2,000 each waiting in a warehouse to be installed, yet they sit there in dry dock because federal regulators say their fittings might taint drinking water with lead.
[00:15:33.575 --> 00:15:46.397]  Yeah, the last lead smelting plant in the US, it's a very important metal for a lot of natural uses, it's been shut down, so you can't even get bullets, but they allow lead in the food from China, just no lead in food produced here.
[00:15:47.509 --> 00:15:49.991]  And I'm talking microscopic amounts you can't have here.
[00:15:50.251 --> 00:15:52.233]  You can just ship it in at thousands of times that.
[00:15:52.793 --> 00:15:55.755]  Again, everything is meant to shut us down.
[00:15:56.456 --> 00:15:57.617]  Shut us down.
[00:15:58.037 --> 00:15:59.198]  Shut America down.
[00:15:59.218 --> 00:16:01.059]  Because remember, the globalists, they're all above the law.
[00:16:01.079 --> 00:16:01.840]  They're all exempt.
[00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:03.982]  This is what their neo-feudalism is.
[00:16:04.682 --> 00:16:07.844]  Under a technological tyranny, a technocracy.
[00:16:08.164 --> 00:16:12.167]  And that leads us now to our guest who will be with us for the balance of the hour.
[00:16:12.907 --> 00:16:16.990]  And then the top former Secret Service agent.
[00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:21.372]  He was the head of operations when the president would go overseas.
[00:16:21.392 --> 00:16:26.555]  Dan Bongino is going to join us with a lot of key intel at the start of the next hour.
[00:16:26.575 --> 00:16:29.037]  And then we'll take phone calls the last 30 minutes or so, I promise.
[00:16:29.637 --> 00:16:32.379]  But Patrick Wood, I was familiar with his writings and work.
[00:16:33.712 --> 00:17:00.333]  From NewsWithViews.com and other places, but I heard him for an hour on Dr. Stan Monteith a few nights ago, and I've read the Technotronic Age, I've read the Anglo-American Establishment, I've read Quigley's books, I've read Brzezinski's books, I read Council on Foreign Relations publications, and so I knew everything he was saying was accurate, but he knew stuff I didn't know and I went and looked it up and it was accurate.
[00:17:01.014 --> 00:17:02.194]  So I wanted to get him on because
[00:17:04.141 --> 00:17:08.583]  He is an editor of a weekly financial analysis service, Findings and Forecasts.
[00:17:08.923 --> 00:17:23.171]  He has studied elite globalization policies, which you need to do to understand economics, since the late 70s when he partnered with the late Anthony C. Sutton, who was a listener and been on the show, to co-author Trilaterals Over Washington Volumes 1 and 2.
[00:17:24.272 --> 00:17:32.915]  He remains a leading expert on the elitist Trilateral Commission, their policies and achievements in creating their self-proclaimed new international economic order.
[00:17:33.395 --> 00:17:40.558]  He is also a leading expert on historic and modern technocracy, which plays a prominent role in current world affairs.
[00:17:40.598 --> 00:17:43.759]  That says it lightly.
[00:17:45.714 --> 00:17:54.083]  An economist by education, a financial analyst, and writer by profession, an American constitutionalist by choice, Wood holds a biblical worldview.
[00:17:54.984 --> 00:18:01.071]  He has a deep historical insight into the modern attacks on sovereignty, property rights, and personal freedom.
[00:18:01.491 --> 00:18:03.494]  Such attacks are the epitome.
[00:18:04.896 --> 00:18:07.537]  Uh, and, uh, by the implementation of U.N.
[00:18:07.597 --> 00:18:15.039]  policies, such as Gen 21, sustainable development, smart growth, and in education, the widespread adoption of Common Core, 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[00:18:15.779 --> 00:18:21.581]  His current research builds on Trilateral Commission hegemony involving transhumanism, technocracy,
[00:18:22.461 --> 00:18:29.724]  And more, and how these are co-opting economics, politics, and religion, which together represent the major pillars of society.
[00:18:29.744 --> 00:18:34.946]  Yes, they're taking over all sciences, philosophies, and re-engineering them, and I appreciate them coming on.
[00:18:35.366 --> 00:18:37.407]  We're going to skip this network break because I'm behind.
[00:18:37.427 --> 00:18:41.309]  This is such important intelligence, so stations shouldn't be skipping this break.
[00:18:41.329 --> 00:18:42.109]  It's a network break.
[00:18:42.589 --> 00:18:45.611]  We're going to do this because it's time, it's important.
[00:18:47.225 --> 00:18:50.387]  Augustforecast.com is his site, and he will be here frequently.
[00:18:50.667 --> 00:18:56.091]  There's so many amazing minds out there that we just tend to forget in our rush.
[00:18:56.151 --> 00:19:10.461]  And Anthony Sutton, of course, advised Congress, discovered all the documents at the Ford Foundation and others, with Patrick Wood, who was a top congressional advisor, on the plan to convert America to a tyranny, how our government funded Stalin, Lenin before him.
[00:19:10.762 --> 00:19:16.506]  Hitler didn't run them or control them, built them, just like Saddam and al-Qaeda and all of it.
[00:19:17.652 --> 00:19:26.101]  And to understand the scientific tyranny, the application of dehumanization, we give you probably one of the greatest living experts.
[00:19:26.381 --> 00:19:29.804]  Because I went and looked into him, and I'd seen his writings, and I was like, I forgot about Patrick Wood.
[00:19:30.085 --> 00:19:31.126]  Why has he never been on the show?
[00:19:31.346 --> 00:19:33.508]  He might have been on, I might have forgot, but I don't believe he's ever been with us.
[00:19:34.409 --> 00:19:36.451]  And it's just so important, a treasure trove.
[00:19:36.471 --> 00:19:39.714]  The reason I'm building this up is, you need to understand, this is your world.
[00:19:39.994 --> 00:19:41.055]  This is how it really runs.
[00:19:41.696 --> 00:19:50.814]  These are the guys that in Congress got the documents and went to the Canadian archives and got the intel to put out the intel and to post the documents on their websites.
[00:19:52.456 --> 00:19:58.321]  I had Sutton on about 17 years ago, and then I tried to get him on a few years later, and he said, I'm sorry, I'm too ill, but I appreciate your work.
[00:19:58.381 --> 00:19:59.442]  And then he died like a week later.
[00:19:59.782 --> 00:20:02.324]  I couldn't believe he was like on his deathbed and was sending me emails back.
[00:20:02.784 --> 00:20:04.686]  So I just really admire his work as well.
[00:20:05.246 --> 00:20:07.368]  And we need to remember these men that have fought so hard.
[00:20:07.648 --> 00:20:14.834]  Mr. Wood, I know it's probably annoying having me gush over you, but your intel is so vital to the preservation of human dignity.
[00:20:15.922 --> 00:20:16.943]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[00:20:17.003 --> 00:20:20.445]  I appreciate the opportunity to get some of this information out.
[00:20:20.645 --> 00:20:27.530]  I've been trying hard, as you know, and I always enjoy doing radio and TV interviews whenever I can.
[00:20:28.271 --> 00:20:28.891]  Well, let's do this.
[00:20:28.931 --> 00:20:30.893]  Let's say you're talking to a new audience.
[00:20:31.213 --> 00:20:39.398]  If you had five minutes on national TV, which this basically is now, three million people right now conservatively watching and listening, how would you introduce it to laymen?
[00:20:39.438 --> 00:20:44.922]  Because my listeners are very smart, very informed, but they always want to give stuff to their family.
[00:20:45.402 --> 00:20:46.923]  And so they want it crystallized.
[00:20:46.983 --> 00:20:51.526]  Give us the basic overview and then get into the nuts and bolts of technocracy.
[00:20:52.594 --> 00:20:59.030]  Well, it's really a, you know it's a complex and a deep topic, but basically the first idea is this.
[00:21:00.251 --> 00:21:07.476]  The problems we've been having in the last 35 to 40 years, especially, have been economic in nature rather than political.
[00:21:07.576 --> 00:21:18.183]  And there's a lot of emphasis in the public, like in the Tea Parties, the conservative movement, and even in liberal circles as well, that the world revolves around politics.
[00:21:18.563 --> 00:21:23.487]  That is, arguing in Congress and, you know, fighting with the executive branch and so on.
[00:21:24.501 --> 00:21:35.889]  And my studies on the Trilateral Commission have pretty much pointed out, I think with great detail, that the takeover of America has been economic in nature.
[00:21:35.989 --> 00:21:38.311]  And that was the nature originally of the Trilateral Commission.
[00:21:38.351 --> 00:21:43.355]  It was formed in 1973 by David Rockefeller and Zbigniew Brzezinski.
[00:21:44.595 --> 00:21:49.479]  They said frequently that they were going to create a new international economic order.
[00:21:50.179 --> 00:21:53.202]  They used that in every one of their early publications.
[00:21:54.342 --> 00:21:54.482]  Yes.
[00:22:14.609 --> 00:22:17.510]  Back then, people criticized us for being conspiracy nuts.
[00:22:18.131 --> 00:22:24.033]  Today, we have the force of history behind us, which after a 25-year period, of course, becomes history.
[00:22:24.693 --> 00:22:30.055]  We can now look back at history and see that what we said in the 1970s was exactly right.
[00:22:30.155 --> 00:22:31.356]  This is exactly what they've done.
[00:22:32.196 --> 00:22:36.838]  We know that the world system today is broken, almost beyond repair.
[00:22:37.758 --> 00:22:42.079]  And we have to put the finger where the finger belongs.
[00:22:42.139 --> 00:22:53.723]  And it belongs with this very small elite group of internationalists that were represented by the members of the Trilateral Commission back in 1973 and ever since, I might add.
[00:22:54.323 --> 00:22:58.965]  And they have influenced our government, the executive branch of our government especially.
[00:22:58.985 --> 00:23:01.286]  They have influenced our government.
[00:23:02.339 --> 00:23:03.340]  I don't
[00:23:21.616 --> 00:23:29.700]  The political system was really just a useful idiot for this elite group of economy changers, if you will.
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:37.043]  They had to use the political system to get what they wanted to do economically over these last years.
[00:23:37.403 --> 00:23:44.046]  And so we see things like the North American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, CAFTA.
[00:23:44.527 --> 00:23:48.288]  We see the Trans-Pacific Partnership being negotiated right now.
[00:23:49.969 --> 00:23:50.189]  Yes.
[00:24:09.682 --> 00:24:12.405]  Nobody has identified these people behind the scenes.
[00:24:13.085 --> 00:24:18.010]  Nobody has, even politicians, will not write about them or speak about them.
[00:24:18.771 --> 00:24:30.681]  In fact, I think the only living politician, living or dead, that I know that ever talked about the Trilateral Commission was Barry Goldwater when he wrote his memoirs with no apologies back in 1979.
[00:24:32.831 --> 00:24:33.372]  I don't know.
[00:24:48.182 --> 00:24:51.164]  I don't know how else I could summarize it in a very short period of time, Alex.
[00:24:51.724 --> 00:24:52.644]  Well, you've done a great job.
[00:24:52.684 --> 00:24:59.468]  In fact, I'm going to pull up the Barry Goldwater quote, with no apologies, where he describes how it's an economic takeover.
[00:24:59.508 --> 00:25:02.989]  We're designed to fight a Stalin, a Hitler, a Mao.
[00:25:03.029 --> 00:25:04.230]  We see a foreign enemy.
[00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:11.954]  But when it's corporate and regulatory and incremental, and it creates a global group of less than 100 corporations, in Rockefeller's own words,
[00:25:13.114 --> 00:25:15.115]  He's written New York Times articles bragging about it.
[00:25:16.156 --> 00:25:19.997]  How they want centralized control and how they divide up the world.
[00:25:20.598 --> 00:25:23.239]  US-based companies get the toll roads in Spain.
[00:25:23.799 --> 00:25:25.740]  Spain gets the toll roads over here.
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:37.265]  It's where they divide up the world amongst themselves and then bring in a technocracy to be able to control the population scientifically where it's impossible
[00:25:37.665 --> 00:25:37.725]  to
[00:25:53.082 --> 00:25:59.305]  Cecil Rhodes plan of 1900 and the British royalty and their empire that was in trouble.
[00:25:59.605 --> 00:26:07.770]  They said we'll go corporate, take down our flag, but use corporate energy to still control these holdings that we once had like India and other places.
[00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:15.232]  And at the same time, we'll export this corporate plan and team up with other robber barons in the United States and Europe.
[00:26:15.472 --> 00:26:16.992]  That's what Bilderberg later became.
[00:26:17.432 --> 00:26:22.534]  But their philosophy comes out of eugenics and Malthus and Galton.
[00:26:23.194 --> 00:26:29.716]  And so it's basically eugenics scientifically deployed through a world government corporate
[00:26:30.436 --> 00:26:32.197]  System so it's very hard to fight.
[00:26:32.257 --> 00:26:33.658]  I want to get your take on that in a moment.
[00:26:33.838 --> 00:26:37.681]  But we did find the quote from no apologies with Barry Goldwater.
[00:26:37.701 --> 00:26:41.263]  He says quote the Trilateral Commission is an international.
[00:26:42.344 --> 00:26:43.085]  is international.
[00:26:43.305 --> 00:26:55.095]  Again, the Trilateral Commission is international and is intended to be the vehicle for multinational consolidation of the commercial and banking interest by seizing control of the political government of the United States.
[00:26:55.575 --> 00:27:02.281]  The Trilateral Commission represents a skillful, coordinated effort to seize control and consolidate the four centers of power.
[00:27:02.381 --> 00:27:06.004]  Political, monetary, intellectual, and ecclesiastical.
[00:27:06.064 --> 00:27:07.725]  The churches, from no apologies.
[00:27:07.786 --> 00:27:10.408]  Now, let me break this down for folks and give you the floor.
[00:27:11.647 --> 00:27:32.251]  America was pretty much the sole superpower by the end of World War II, so the globalists had to create a fake bipolar world by giving weapons to the Soviets to then build them up to let us become a tyranny and then share in a backdoor globalist deal taking over different areas of the world in the name of fighting each other.
[00:27:32.711 --> 00:27:33.892]  In full spectrum dominance.
[00:27:34.392 --> 00:27:41.636]  Then, they ended that farce, and then moved on to the new Al-Qaeda threat, which they actually ran, to use that to take our liberty.
[00:27:41.656 --> 00:27:56.885]  So I'm basically describing the main trait of technocracy is that it's totally amoral, except for the eugenics-based system, that it doesn't even, it uses everything, as Carol quickly said, socialism, fascism, communism, as long as it's command and control.
[00:27:56.925 --> 00:27:57.365]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:27:58.325 --> 00:28:07.669]  Well, the book Brave New World by Aldous Huxley, we refer to it in pretty much everywhere people talk about, oh, it's a brave new world.
[00:28:08.609 --> 00:28:19.854]  That book was written in 1932, Alex, and it was written by Aldous Huxley looking straight into the face of technocracy that was a big movement back then.
[00:28:20.374 --> 00:28:25.677]  I didn't discover the technocracy movement from the 1930s until a few years ago.
[00:28:26.377 --> 00:28:35.045]  And when I did, it piqued my interest so much I had to investigate and just, you know, go crazy looking for information to try and find out what they're all about.
[00:28:35.165 --> 00:28:42.371]  It was a huge movement back in those days, had a big popularity, a large popularity in Canada.
[00:28:42.891 --> 00:28:45.874]  And especially in the West, although it did pretty well to ease as well.
[00:28:46.675 --> 00:28:54.924]  But these technocrats specified very carefully what they would do if they could replace capitalism.
[00:28:54.964 --> 00:28:57.487]  They believed in the Great Depression that capitalism was dead.
[00:28:58.147 --> 00:29:00.689]  Unemployment lines were, you know, wrapping around blocks.
[00:29:00.729 --> 00:29:03.951]  Soup kitchens were, you know, just serving people all day long.
[00:29:04.571 --> 00:29:11.235]  And they believed that they could provide an economic system that would be better than capitalism.
[00:29:11.736 --> 00:29:12.696]  And it didn't get very far.
[00:29:12.736 --> 00:29:16.359]  It kind of died out as a movement around 1938 to 40.
[00:29:17.199 --> 00:29:22.102]  But today it's had a resurgence, if you will.
[00:29:22.182 --> 00:29:24.504]  Sure, it's been adopted as the globalist management program.
[00:29:25.262 --> 00:29:28.125]  It has now been adopted by the Globalist Management Program.
[00:29:28.165 --> 00:29:30.688]  And the reason I say this is important, we follow the money.
[00:29:31.268 --> 00:29:37.975]  Back in the 1930s, the Rockefeller and Carnegie crowd were dumping buckets of money onto the eugenics movement.
[00:29:38.736 --> 00:29:40.517]  This is well known and well documented.
[00:29:40.838 --> 00:29:44.321]  They did not dump any money on the technocracy movement back then.
[00:29:44.962 --> 00:29:48.846]  And so the technocracy movement kind of withered and died after a period of time.
[00:29:49.346 --> 00:30:04.098]  However, when Zbigniew Brzezinski resuscitated those ideas in 1970 with his book called Between Two Ages, America's Role in the Technotronic Era, that apparently caught Rockefeller's eye.
[00:30:04.198 --> 00:30:04.618]  That's right.
[00:30:04.678 --> 00:30:06.579]  Patrick Wood, stay there.
[00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:10.222]  We'll explain who David Rockefeller is, Zbigniew Brzezinski, and more.
[00:30:10.823 --> 00:30:16.127]  These two men, you can say more than anybody now, literally govern our civilization.
[00:30:16.507 --> 00:30:17.328]  We'll be right back.
[00:30:19.198 --> 00:30:22.220]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:30:23.141 --> 00:30:25.923]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:29.966 --> 00:30:35.569]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:42.995]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[00:30:43.135 --> 00:30:46.317]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[00:30:46.477 --> 00:30:48.278]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[00:30:48.518 --> 00:30:53.081]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[00:30:53.161 --> 00:30:55.923]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[00:30:56.083 --> 00:31:01.866]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[00:31:02.046 --> 00:31:05.528]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[00:31:05.708 --> 00:31:10.771]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine.
[00:31:10.971 --> 00:31:13.933]  Exclusively available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:31:14.193 --> 00:31:20.057]  Nascent Iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.

[00:31:35.648 --> 00:31:40.211]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[00:31:40.251 --> 00:31:41.732]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium
[00:31:41.732 --> 00:31:46.175]  Sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:31:46.295 --> 00:31:57.281]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.

[00:32:29.825 --> 00:32:30.666]  The facts are in.
[00:32:30.846 --> 00:32:31.987]  The studies are legion.
[00:32:32.267 --> 00:32:39.591]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[00:32:39.771 --> 00:32:43.254]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[00:32:43.594 --> 00:32:43.974]  Simple.
[00:32:44.174 --> 00:32:48.517]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[00:32:48.877 --> 00:32:54.338]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[00:32:54.598 --> 00:33:10.602]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield Formulation, fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[00:33:10.922 --> 00:33:15.165]  Let's take a stand against the Globalists by blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.
[00:33:15.505 --> 00:33:17.346]  I use Fluoride Shield every day.
[00:33:17.666 --> 00:33:22.949]  Secure your Fluoride Shield and other pioneering formulations at InfoWarsLife.com today.
[00:33:23.209 --> 00:33:27.472]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the InfoWar at the same time.
[00:33:27.632 --> 00:33:29.413]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:33:40.162 --> 00:33:42.286]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[00:33:42.346 --> 00:33:42.707]  Brilliant.
[00:33:42.827 --> 00:33:44.831]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[00:33:44.851 --> 00:33:45.612]  I love this song.
[00:33:45.632 --> 00:33:47.876]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:33:47.936 --> 00:33:49.700]  Let's roll some of this summer rage.
[00:34:16.578 --> 00:34:17.819]  Best part right here.
[00:34:51.226 --> 00:34:59.590]  Alright, I'm going to go to your phone calls here and I'm going to try to shut up, just let you make your point and move to the next person.
[00:34:59.670 --> 00:35:00.430]  I'll never get to anybody.
[00:35:04.252 --> 00:35:08.233]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jody in North Carolina.
[00:35:08.433 --> 00:35:09.334]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[00:35:09.354 --> 00:35:12.175]  Hey Alex, can you hear me?
[00:35:12.815 --> 00:35:13.516]  Yes, I can.
[00:35:13.556 --> 00:35:14.276]  Thank you for calling.
[00:35:15.177 --> 00:35:15.978]  Yes, sir.
[00:35:16.518 --> 00:35:23.483]  I'm from North Carolina, so I just wanted to let you know that North Carolina, the way I was raised, we say thank you anyway.
[00:35:23.763 --> 00:35:30.168]  I know you don't want to say that, but I also wanted you to know that I'm also a simple war hound.
[00:35:30.248 --> 00:35:34.230]  I'm out here constantly, you know, doing my research and studying.
[00:35:35.091 --> 00:35:43.137]  When I first heard about you, I'm a first-time caller, but I heard about you about a year ago from a friend of mine.
[00:35:44.528 --> 00:35:45.770]  I decided to check you out.
[00:35:45.830 --> 00:35:54.940]  I've been growing up on a little bit of Rush Limbaugh, a little bit of Glenn Beck, and others, and a little bit of Savage Nation, but I listen to your show.
[00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:55.941]  I'm a truck driver.
[00:35:56.001 --> 00:35:57.503]  I drive up and down these highways.
[00:35:57.623 --> 00:36:01.588]  I do in-house delivery out of High Point, North Carolina.
[00:36:03.276 --> 00:36:05.678]  I just wanted to let you know, man, that I'm out here.
[00:36:05.698 --> 00:36:07.739]  I'll let these customers know about you.
[00:36:07.839 --> 00:36:09.160]  I've done my research.
[00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:11.841]  Outside of God, I believe in you, brother.
[00:36:11.902 --> 00:36:12.862]  I believe in your cause.
[00:36:13.783 --> 00:36:28.492]  I believed it for 10 years myself before I found you, which is kind of like a blessing in my life because you opened up a whole new perspective on things that I had overlooked because I was also dumbed down with this mainstream media and society.
[00:36:30.117 --> 00:36:36.023]  After opening up everything and kind of just revealing your Pandora's box and what was going on, I see it was the truth.
[00:36:36.143 --> 00:36:40.667]  And I think the hardest thing for me is trying to go to my family members.
[00:36:41.288 --> 00:36:44.911]  God, it seems like they're the ones that don't want to believe in it.
[00:36:45.052 --> 00:36:47.013]  Oh, listen, brother, I know the feeling.
[00:36:48.135 --> 00:36:51.057]  I'll be around family members and people that aren't really listeners.
[00:36:52.253 --> 00:37:01.700]  And they're nice folks and they're somewhat awake compared to the average person, but you almost feel like you're doing bad things to tell them about bad stuff that's happening.
[00:37:02.421 --> 00:37:05.503]  It's almost like impolite, but we don't have a future if we don't.
[00:37:06.223 --> 00:37:09.185]  We owe it to them to admit just how bad things are.
[00:37:10.146 --> 00:37:20.574]  Because, again, as good people, or as just folks that aren't overtly evil, none of us are perfect, we are blind to just how bad bad people are and that
[00:37:22.338 --> 00:37:23.678]  It's limitless what they'll do.
[00:37:24.659 --> 00:37:28.420]  So I totally understand what you're saying and what you're getting at.
[00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:34.762]  And that's why I personally, I don't really beat family over the head with this info if they don't already know what's going on.
[00:37:36.322 --> 00:37:40.304]  I reach out to folks just randomly everywhere and tell them what's happening.
[00:37:40.324 --> 00:37:41.284]  And it's certainly working.
[00:37:41.304 --> 00:37:43.025]  There is an undoubted awakening happening.
[00:37:43.045 --> 00:37:48.786]  And Ron Paul concurs, I think the first time ever, he said we're getting close to a turning the tide or close to a tipping point.
[00:37:49.146 --> 00:37:50.427]  He now thinks we're right there.
[00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:53.920]  And I agree with Dr. Paul, it was a pretty smart cookie.
[00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:56.301]  So what else did you want to throw out there, Jody?
[00:37:56.341 --> 00:38:01.262]  I appreciate you promoting the show to folks, because that's how we're going to expose these people.
[00:38:02.202 --> 00:38:03.102]  Absolutely, sir.
[00:38:03.282 --> 00:38:03.602]  I agree 100%.
[00:38:04.402 --> 00:38:07.823]  I just want to let you know also that I go to customers' homes every day.
[00:38:07.843 --> 00:38:12.164]  I deal with 40, 50 customers every trip.
[00:38:12.244 --> 00:38:14.484]  I'm all over this country, all 48 states.
[00:38:14.984 --> 00:38:18.765]  So I get to see a lot of these things you're talking about as I'm doing my travels here.
[00:38:20.496 --> 00:38:23.237]  And I have noticed how, you know, things are changing.
[00:38:23.277 --> 00:38:27.299]  I've been looking out for the armored vehicles, the things like that, the sheriff's departments and things.
[00:38:27.359 --> 00:38:28.180]  I go through Dallas.
[00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:30.121]  I lived in Dallas for three years, man.
[00:38:30.261 --> 00:38:31.181]  I love Texas.
[00:38:31.281 --> 00:38:34.823]  If I ever retire, I told my wife, that's where I want to live at.
[00:38:34.863 --> 00:38:36.704]  Would love to live right next door to you.
[00:38:36.964 --> 00:38:38.445]  Man, you're like my biggest hero.
[00:38:38.505 --> 00:38:42.907]  But anyway, outside of that stuff, I just want to say,
[00:38:45.178 --> 00:39:01.852]  Maybe you can tell me how I can convince my wife, who's an intelligent woman, 4.0 GPA, graduated, high honors, she's in the medical field, I do science research study on like the first stage one, phase one of... No, I get it, she's a smart lady.
[00:39:03.173 --> 00:39:04.174]  What should I convince her of?
[00:39:05.323 --> 00:39:23.329]  Well, I just wanted to know if you had 30 seconds to tell my wife or to try to convince my wife of what's going on in our country today and to really wake up and be a part of my team and the InfoWar team, the team that's driving for the truth and the right direction, what would you say?
[00:39:23.349 --> 00:39:25.350]  Alright, well I appreciate your call.
[00:39:25.370 --> 00:39:27.031]  Let me just say this to your wife, Jodi.
[00:39:27.071 --> 00:39:27.611]  Thank you, Jodi.
[00:39:29.472 --> 00:39:34.193]  I can't make her do research on the topics we're covering.
[00:39:34.673 --> 00:39:50.637]  And I notice a lot of professionals that are really smart are some of the hardest people to wake up to this because they know there's problems in society, but they see it as almost positive that they overlook all that and just move forward and take care of business, as Elvis Presley would say.
[00:39:51.537 --> 00:39:57.199]  And you certainly have to take care of business, and you can't let all this tyranny get you down and stop you from living a life.
[00:39:58.134 --> 00:40:05.699]  But you've got to understand, historically, when corruption builds to this level, it brings down civilizations and horrible tragedies happen.
[00:40:06.219 --> 00:40:08.961]  And tyranny is a norm in history, not an exception.
[00:40:09.402 --> 00:40:14.025]  And we've got a really bad batch of tyranny cooking up in the kitchen.
[00:40:14.645 --> 00:40:15.846]  And it needs to be thrown out.
[00:40:17.327 --> 00:40:26.293]  And so, I understand, statistically, that husbands and wives don't listen to each other as much as they'd listen to a random salesman at the door.
[00:40:27.933 --> 00:40:32.516]  And so I guess I'm a random salesman at the door selling freedom.
[00:40:33.957 --> 00:40:47.325]  And I would just say to Jody's wife that there's so much admitted evil by the criminals that hide in government and major corporations that if I tried to just list a few things, it would make my head spin.
[00:40:47.386 --> 00:40:50.928]  I mean, there's thousands of declassified, and I use this a lot because everybody knows this,
[00:40:52.438 --> 00:40:58.320]  Lethal studies that were killing people carried out by our government right through the last decade.
[00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:00.020]  From the 30s.
[00:41:01.321 --> 00:41:02.981]  And no one ever got in trouble for any of it.
[00:41:03.641 --> 00:41:10.304]  And that's because there's a eugenicist-based power structure hiding within Western governments.
[00:41:10.444 --> 00:41:15.425]  Hitler was only one eruption of that that went too far for even the establishment.
[00:41:16.205 --> 00:41:20.887]  And so, I understand that this stuff's scary and it's easy to just deny it.
[00:41:21.761 --> 00:41:29.566]  But I'll assure you that it is real and that I am actually wrong about a lot of this.
[00:41:29.646 --> 00:41:31.667]  It's worse than I normally have thought.
[00:41:32.208 --> 00:41:35.330]  So it's not that I'm exaggerating.
[00:41:35.970 --> 00:41:36.811]  It's the other way around.
[00:41:37.931 --> 00:41:40.773]  And I wish every day I was wrong, ma'am.
[00:41:41.634 --> 00:41:43.175]  I wish every day this wasn't true.
[00:41:44.204 --> 00:41:47.405]  But I have the textbooks, I have the documents.
[00:41:48.305 --> 00:41:51.745]  I keep plugging this every day just because it's been on my desk the last few months.
[00:41:51.765 --> 00:41:52.886]  I need to put it back on the bookshelf.
[00:41:52.966 --> 00:41:54.486]  EcoScience, it's free online.
[00:41:55.046 --> 00:41:59.667]  It's been scanned online about how they put stuff in the water to reduce our IQ and sterilize us.
[00:42:00.727 --> 00:42:06.448]  The White House regulations are currently talks about, you know, dumbing us down and breaking us up and having us fight with each other.
[00:42:06.468 --> 00:42:07.748]  I mean, these are social engineers.
[00:42:08.468 --> 00:42:11.589]  And you ignore all of this at your own peril.
[00:42:14.554 --> 00:42:25.199]  Dan Bongino, the Secret Service agent, senior agent over Obama's foreign trips, basically has said it's worse than anyone knows.
[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:27.621]  He had to sign agreements not to talk about it, obviously.
[00:42:29.041 --> 00:42:33.464]  And it is... Last night, I talked to a Secret Service connection.
[00:42:34.804 --> 00:42:35.485]  It doesn't matter.
[00:42:37.358 --> 00:42:38.579]  See, I don't even want to get into this.
[00:42:38.699 --> 00:42:39.740]  It's just so crazy.
[00:42:40.901 --> 00:42:43.643]  I mean, there's a lot of stuff going on.
[00:42:44.544 --> 00:42:46.145]  There's a cult stuff going on.
[00:42:47.907 --> 00:42:48.808]  And we're in trouble.
[00:42:48.828 --> 00:42:50.089]  I mean, that's all I can say.
[00:42:50.129 --> 00:42:54.592]  And ma'am, I know you probably feel like, well, what can you do about it?
[00:42:55.113 --> 00:42:56.134]  So why not just deny it?
[00:42:56.634 --> 00:42:57.835]  And so fine, just deny it.
[00:42:58.356 --> 00:43:04.461]  But down the road when things get so bad you can't deny it anymore, then at least get your heart right with God.
[00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:06.511]  I said I'd take a lot of calls.
[00:43:06.571 --> 00:43:07.611]  I just spent six, seven minutes.
[00:43:08.312 --> 00:43:09.613]  Seven minutes on that one subject.
[00:43:10.333 --> 00:43:10.833]  Or longer.
[00:43:10.893 --> 00:43:12.795]  Let's go to Wesley real fast in Mississippi.
[00:43:12.835 --> 00:43:13.215]  Go ahead.
[00:43:14.516 --> 00:43:15.376]  Hey, Alex.
[00:43:15.916 --> 00:43:19.298]  I want to say that the new coffee and the nice iodine are amazing.
[00:43:19.559 --> 00:43:20.379]  I love the coffee.
[00:43:20.659 --> 00:43:21.560]  I should take it some right now.
[00:43:22.450 --> 00:43:28.215]  And to Jody, if your wife doesn't believe this stuff, it's because she hasn't taken the time to look into this stuff.
[00:43:28.235 --> 00:43:30.737]  That's the only way you can come to that conclusion.
[00:43:30.898 --> 00:43:40.306]  If you take 30 minutes to look into this stuff, research New World Order, research Illuminati, research all this conspiracy, and there's no way you can come away from it without realizing it's the truth.
[00:43:40.946 --> 00:43:55.738]  And I want to commend you, Alex, because there's so many Christians that are blind to this evil, and I know you don't like to accept the praise and everything, but at least, I mean, I'm surprised you mentioned stuff like the Nephilim and the Book of Enoch and this stuff, because that's what this stuff is.
[00:43:55.778 --> 00:44:06.407]  That's what Kurzweil and Hugo de Guerras, that's what they're all talking about when they're talking about hybridization and transhumanism and the singularity they're all trying to come to.
[00:44:06.467 --> 00:44:09.470]  They're talking about the same stuff that happened in the days of Noah.
[00:44:10.862 --> 00:44:13.183]  Exactly what it is, because that's what Jesus said.
[00:44:13.243 --> 00:44:15.384]  The days of Noah, that's what it's going to be like.
[00:44:15.704 --> 00:44:19.126]  When the end times come, when his return will be, it's like it wasn't the days of Noah.
[00:44:19.186 --> 00:44:20.327]  What was going on in the days of Noah?
[00:44:20.687 --> 00:44:30.952]  Well, the sons of God were coming down and having sex, or genetically modifying human beings to create giants, which no church will ever talk about, the giants.
[00:44:30.992 --> 00:44:35.694]  No church ever explains why Goliath was 9 feet tall, while Aga-Bashan was 18 feet tall, while Amos
[00:44:39.116 --> 00:44:41.417]  They say the Amorites were, you know, the tallest.
[00:44:41.677 --> 00:44:45.920]  No, I know, and that's actually what they all, the occultists now, even mainline literature, believes.
[00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:47.701]  The Anunnaki, all this.
[00:44:47.721 --> 00:44:52.443]  If I don't get into it, but the elite, and I don't cover stuff I can't prove, but you see the movie Prometheus?
[00:44:52.903 --> 00:44:53.824]  That's an Anunnaki.
[00:44:54.224 --> 00:44:55.405]  Nine foot tall guy.
[00:44:55.945 --> 00:44:57.446]  That's what they're telling us we came from.
[00:44:58.522 --> 00:45:01.824]  And, uh, the Bible says, no, that's who came here to manipulate us.
[00:45:01.864 --> 00:45:04.425]  And that's basically, you know, the fallen angels.
[00:45:04.485 --> 00:45:06.607]  And I don't get into all that because the media picks up on it.
[00:45:06.987 --> 00:45:11.249]  I just cover, you look at why they're doing all this engineering, why they're, they think they're God.
[00:45:11.890 --> 00:45:15.151]  The elite are into this themselves.
[00:45:15.592 --> 00:45:17.813]  What's that term that they say we were seeded by aliens?
[00:45:18.193 --> 00:45:21.015]  It's like Harvard even believes in MIT and transpermia.
[00:45:21.555 --> 00:45:22.295]  What's, what's that term?
[00:45:23.036 --> 00:45:23.336]  What is it?
[00:45:24.827 --> 00:45:25.587]  Panspermia.
[00:45:25.607 --> 00:45:27.788]  Yeah, that's in the piece I did with Aaron Dykes.
[00:45:27.848 --> 00:45:28.508]  It's excellent.
[00:45:29.489 --> 00:45:30.929]  On Secrets of Prometheus leaked.
[00:45:31.249 --> 00:45:32.149]  Good to hear from you, sir.
[00:45:32.590 --> 00:45:35.050]  Again, whether that's real or not, that's what they think, okay?
[00:45:35.711 --> 00:45:37.031]  Skull and bones, all of it.
[00:45:37.091 --> 00:45:39.192]  And they think they're in touch with these entities.
[00:45:39.892 --> 00:45:44.274]  That's what demon conjuring and all that stuff is, folks, that every culture gets into.
[00:45:44.694 --> 00:45:47.455]  And the demons say, take your kid up on a pyramid and chop their heart out.
[00:45:47.895 --> 00:45:52.816]  I mean, every culture went to kill their kids so these creatures would give them power.
[00:45:52.836 --> 00:45:54.097]  I don't know if that's real or not.
[00:45:55.031 --> 00:46:02.856]  But as a sociologist, as an anthropologist, as an archaeologist, as a lay researcher, I look at this and go, why does every culture do this?
[00:46:03.577 --> 00:46:16.045]  Well, they tell you why in the movie Prometheus, which is a religious tract promoting by the transhumanists that of course they don't think it's evolution and all this Darwin stuff, that we came from this.
[00:46:20.453 --> 00:46:27.056]  And then some bad gods were going to come back and destroy the Earth because they'd mixed their genetics with us and they didn't like that.
[00:46:27.697 --> 00:46:29.397]  But the good aliens stopped it all.
[00:46:29.417 --> 00:46:34.180]  I mean, they're just telling you the story of the devil and the snake and all of it in that movie.
[00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:35.961]  Super heavy, folks.
[00:46:36.521 --> 00:46:37.441]  Super heavy.
[00:46:38.922 --> 00:46:40.423]  I don't know if any of this is real.
[00:46:40.923 --> 00:46:43.384]  I know the Federal Reserve is private and they tell me it's governmental.
[00:46:45.705 --> 00:46:46.826]  By the way, he mentioned it.
[00:46:46.866 --> 00:46:48.787]  Look, I've got to fund my operation.
[00:46:50.723 --> 00:46:51.424]  I need fuel.
[00:46:51.484 --> 00:46:57.090]  It's expensive to build an operation like this, and we need capital in case we get sued or attacked to defend ourselves.
[00:46:57.110 --> 00:47:00.814]  And you've done that so we can expand in the face of the new world order fearlessly.
[00:47:00.994 --> 00:47:03.056]  Thank you for your prayers.
[00:47:03.376 --> 00:47:06.480]  My favorite brand of coffee, took me years to find out how to get it directly from the farmers.
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:07.641]  We put it out.
[00:47:08.302 --> 00:47:09.463]  Everybody that tries it loves it.
[00:47:09.943 --> 00:47:12.766]  It's a medium roast, high mountain.
[00:47:13.847 --> 00:47:17.750]  Arabica, shade-grown, and it's even better than Guatemalan.
[00:47:17.770 --> 00:47:18.831]  Guatemalan been my favorite.
[00:47:19.172 --> 00:47:22.474]  Go over the border, the Mexican's even better, they think, because the soils aren't played out.
[00:47:22.834 --> 00:47:24.576]  And it's grown totally organically.
[00:47:25.917 --> 00:47:31.081]  Infowarslife.com for our two different Patriot blends, including the one with mushrooms for immune boost.
[00:47:31.862 --> 00:47:36.045]  It's very fairly priced for a pound of this, lightly or medium roast coffee.
[00:47:36.505 --> 00:47:38.607]  We've got it without the mushrooms and with the mushrooms.
[00:47:39.087 --> 00:47:39.708]  It's excellent.
[00:47:40.598 --> 00:47:42.479]  Most of the coffee gives me headaches or heartburn.
[00:47:42.559 --> 00:47:43.379]  That's the reason I like this.
[00:47:43.439 --> 00:47:44.599]  It doesn't give me headaches or heartburn.
[00:47:44.899 --> 00:47:46.480]  I don't know why it's my favorite coffee.
[00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:53.782]  I never thought about putting out coffee until my wife like five years ago said, you should put up Wake Up America coffee and say Jones for it.
[00:47:54.582 --> 00:47:57.903]  And then I actually tracked down how to get it and did it.
[00:47:59.190 --> 00:48:00.751]  That helps support our operation.
[00:48:01.311 --> 00:48:05.234]  The survival shield, nascent iodine, we have plenty of that in supply.
[00:48:05.254 --> 00:48:11.618]  And you can give it as gifts to your family for detoxifying and protecting from the radiation that goes into the thyroid.
[00:48:12.019 --> 00:48:18.043]  With all this Fukushima garbage, it's more important than ever, and it just really gives me a brain boost, which is what Dr. Gribbs said it would do.
[00:48:18.503 --> 00:48:19.103]  We have madein1776.com.
[00:48:19.283 --> 00:48:23.026]  It's also on infowarsstore.com with the news.
[00:48:23.106 --> 00:48:24.447]  Limited edition, George Washington.
[00:48:25.167 --> 00:48:26.468]  The answer to 1984, 1776 bronze and nickel belt buckles.
[00:48:29.890 --> 00:48:32.252]  Uh, that are custom 1 through 500 and then that's it.
[00:48:32.512 --> 00:48:34.993]  We've got the Made in America t-shirts with Liberty messages.
[00:48:35.374 --> 00:48:37.355]  This is just the introductory round of this.
[00:48:38.049 --> 00:48:38.649]  That's right.
[00:49:02.085 --> 00:49:05.530]  Everything at MadeIn1776.com is made in America.
[00:49:05.971 --> 00:49:08.915]  Some of the other stuff's made in South America and, you know, everywhere else.
[00:49:09.776 --> 00:49:13.821]  I'm not against giving those folks jobs, but the way they have it set up, they can never get out of poverty yet.
[00:49:13.841 --> 00:49:15.644]  So we're moving towards made in America.
[00:49:16.105 --> 00:49:17.426]  Everything at MadeIn1776.com is made in America.
[00:49:19.369 --> 00:49:20.910]  We got golf shirts, you name it.
[00:49:20.930 --> 00:49:27.296]  I mean, we're talking about shirts costing me, I was corrected, $13 to $15 for some of these shirts that we sell for $24.95.
[00:49:27.996 --> 00:49:31.740]  At a store like Dillard's, you'd pay $100 for a golf shirt like this.
[00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:38.966]  So it's premium, designer, made in America, golf shirts, you name it, for $24.95.
[00:49:39.666 --> 00:49:42.769]  You absolutely cannot beat that deal.
[00:49:42.789 --> 00:49:43.870]  Here, scroll down and I'll show them.
[00:49:46.732 --> 00:49:48.273]  By the way, I listed the price on these.
[00:49:48.313 --> 00:49:50.013]  I want to lower the price on those ball caps.
[00:49:50.053 --> 00:49:51.134]  I didn't see that they were that much.
[00:49:51.534 --> 00:49:52.354]  Want to find out how much?
[00:49:52.374 --> 00:49:52.735]  Scroll down.
[00:49:55.136 --> 00:49:56.736]  Alright, so there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:49:56.776 --> 00:49:57.997]  I see some of the prices on there.
[00:49:58.017 --> 00:50:05.020]  I'm going to lower some of the prices on those right after the show, because that's not exactly... I get so busy and I run everything around here that I can't make all the decisions.
[00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:06.481]  Everybody does a great job, but...
[00:50:07.554 --> 00:50:07.874]  I don't think so.
[00:50:28.482 --> 00:50:34.065]  A few months ago, and literally, I don't know, 50 to 100 M4s t-shirts, but that wasn't it.
[00:50:34.125 --> 00:50:35.245]  That's not why I got excited.
[00:50:35.705 --> 00:50:38.727]  I saw all these other come and take it in Latin.
[00:50:40.097 --> 00:50:42.479]  Molon Labe shirts, we're gonna come out with a bunch of those.
[00:50:44.181 --> 00:50:46.723]  Under the 1776, made in 1776 brand.
[00:50:47.343 --> 00:50:50.826]  And I just saw Patriot stuff everywhere, and now I go to other cities and see it.
[00:50:51.167 --> 00:50:55.771]  We are really a giant minority that's growing towards being a majority.
[00:50:55.791 --> 00:51:01.335]  And I don't care whether you're black or white, old or young, man, I really like it when I see you wearing a Molon Labe shirt.
[00:51:02.016 --> 00:51:04.338]  I identify with you, we're on the same page.
[00:51:04.778 --> 00:51:06.420]  We are in the same tribe of liberty.
[00:51:07.538 --> 00:51:08.059]  Don't you see?
[00:51:08.099 --> 00:51:09.720]  That's the secret to beating the globalists.
[00:51:10.061 --> 00:51:13.124]  They want a fake collectivism of race or all this stuff.
[00:51:13.404 --> 00:51:17.368]  How about an individual collectivism of individuals coming together for liberty?
[00:51:18.189 --> 00:51:19.310]  And so that's what this is all about.
[00:51:19.390 --> 00:51:19.950]  Madein1776.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:51:19.970 --> 00:51:23.754]  We'll be right back on the other side with your phone calls for Jim and others.
[00:51:23.774 --> 00:51:24.134]  Stay with us.
[00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:30.940]  The facts are in.
[00:51:31.141 --> 00:51:32.261]  The studies are legion.
[00:51:32.541 --> 00:51:39.904]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[00:51:40.064 --> 00:51:43.526]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[00:51:43.886 --> 00:51:44.286]  Simple.
[00:51:44.446 --> 00:51:48.808]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[00:51:49.168 --> 00:51:54.630]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[00:51:54.870 --> 00:52:00.232]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield Formulation.
[00:52:00.412 --> 00:52:10.875]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.

[00:54:30.228 --> 00:54:30.745]  Yeah.
[00:54:37.452 --> 00:54:44.095]  That there's geoengineering going on and changing of the climate with the patents added to the jet fuels.
[00:54:44.215 --> 00:54:46.836]  Even the airlines don't even know what's going on in most cases.
[00:54:47.556 --> 00:54:55.820]  They have all these so-called experts all over the news promoting geoengineering and children's textbooks that we've been showing you for a decade under federal curricula.
[00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:56.961]  There's literally scores of them.
[00:54:57.001 --> 00:54:57.281]  Teach!
[00:54:58.081 --> 00:55:03.463]  Oh, we added to jet fuel barium salt aluminum dioxide to put up sunscreen to protect us from global warming.
[00:55:04.064 --> 00:55:04.704]  You can look that up.
[00:55:04.784 --> 00:55:06.745]  Textbooks teach kids about chemtrailing.
[00:55:08.271 --> 00:55:14.095]  So there's a giant, last time I checked, $5 billion a year just Department of Energy with one group.
[00:55:14.836 --> 00:55:20.200]  And then look, Stephen Colbert, Colbert, government likely covering up chemtrail conspiracy.
[00:55:21.121 --> 00:55:26.865]  So they have an expert on their quote saying we need the geoengineer to save the earth because of climate change.
[00:55:29.107 --> 00:55:33.210]  And then Colbert goes, what if the government is already doing this and not telling us about it?
[00:55:33.570 --> 00:55:35.752]  But still, it's all in the context of a joke.
[00:55:36.932 --> 00:55:40.415]  It's like, oh, what have the NSA's really spying on us 15 years ago?
[00:55:40.435 --> 00:55:43.618]  And I'm like, here's the documents, here's the... Oh, shut up, Nutt!
[00:55:45.820 --> 00:55:46.961]  I mean, it's absolute!
[00:55:47.521 --> 00:55:52.986]  But people go, I don't see any documents on chemtrails, because they're not called chemtrails, it's called geoengineering programs.
[00:55:53.566 --> 00:55:56.148]  High-altitude aerosol programs, stuff like that.
[00:55:56.389 --> 00:55:57.830]  You type that in, you'll get it all.
[00:55:58.190 --> 00:55:59.892]  Patents, how they do it, where they're doing it.
[00:56:00.612 --> 00:56:05.543]  And then all these kooks point up at regular condensation trails and go, look, that's it!
[00:56:06.966 --> 00:56:10.854]  So there's also disinfo on the other side, but it's going on, boys and girls.
[00:56:12.549 --> 00:56:15.350]  When I was a kid, condensation trails went away in seconds or minutes.
[00:56:15.370 --> 00:56:16.490]  They didn't stay there for hours.
[00:56:16.510 --> 00:56:17.790]  They're in the sky gray.
[00:56:17.830 --> 00:56:18.130]  Look at this.
[00:56:18.530 --> 00:56:19.210]  And it goes on.
[00:56:19.230 --> 00:56:21.051]  The video's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:56:21.111 --> 00:56:23.271]  We'll probably cover this on the nightly news tonight.
[00:56:23.891 --> 00:56:25.272]  It's pretty darn important.
[00:56:25.312 --> 00:56:31.313]  That's an InfoWars.com story up there, breaking all of that down.
[00:56:31.953 --> 00:56:37.334]  Some of the other news, Rahm Emanuel to fast 24 hours in support of immigration reform.
[00:56:37.354 --> 00:56:40.555]  They mean totally bringing in unlimited numbers of people to vote
[00:56:41.255 --> 00:56:44.061]  To take all of our money and take all of our guns and enslave us.
[00:56:44.081 --> 00:56:45.063]  That is the public plan.
[00:56:46.285 --> 00:56:47.127]  Rahm Emanuel, who's...
[00:56:48.387 --> 00:56:51.750]  I don't have anything against the Israelis, folks, but I mean, he was in the Israeli military.
[00:56:52.110 --> 00:56:54.813]  He is an Israeli firster, just like the new Fed head they want.
[00:56:55.614 --> 00:57:00.058]  And it's like having this French communist as the head economist for Obama.
[00:57:00.118 --> 00:57:07.445]  I mean, our country is just... Half the news anchors are from England, and they're just getting us used to nothing but foreigners running our lives.
[00:57:08.266 --> 00:57:11.288]  And I mean, Rahm Emanuel is a Chicago mob boss pig.
[00:57:12.304 --> 00:57:14.645]  He is a big, disgusting piece of trash.
[00:57:15.285 --> 00:57:16.406]  And I'm so sick of him.
[00:57:16.886 --> 00:57:22.809]  He's just a miscreant trash bag who wants our guns while he's got bodyguards.
[00:57:22.829 --> 00:57:23.730]  And I'm sick of it.
[00:57:24.390 --> 00:57:25.630]  Jim in Bulgaria.
[00:57:25.651 --> 00:57:26.531]  I didn't see that call.
[00:57:26.551 --> 00:57:27.171]  Thanks for holding.
[00:57:27.191 --> 00:57:28.232]  Sorry, Jim, to make you hold.
[00:57:28.552 --> 00:57:28.912]  Go ahead.
[00:57:28.932 --> 00:57:29.532]  You're on the air.
[00:57:29.552 --> 00:57:31.833]  Hey, Mr. Jones.
[00:57:32.294 --> 00:57:32.794]  Hey, buddy.
[00:57:32.974 --> 00:57:40.778]  I'd like to say, I want you to say hi to your new future InfoWars reporter.
[00:57:41.744 --> 00:57:43.986]  All right, brother, we got about a minute and a half, so thank you.
[00:57:44.006 --> 00:57:44.487]  Yes, tell us.
[00:57:44.547 --> 00:57:45.547]  OK, yeah, I got to be fast.
[00:57:45.648 --> 00:58:03.924]  OK, well, you're an inspiration to me, and I kind of like to make a joke here a little bit and say that you're the reason why I left my friends and family and I moved out of the United States and I came here to Bulgaria to prepare for this worldwide economic collapse and world war.
[00:58:04.284 --> 00:58:04.945]  But of course, it's
[00:58:07.225 --> 00:58:08.607]  You know, it's true.
[00:58:09.007 --> 00:58:12.330]  I mean, you had this other person, this Jody's wife.
[00:58:13.311 --> 00:58:16.395]  My wife, she was like a zombie.
[00:58:16.515 --> 00:58:20.779]  I mean, for years and years I used to tell her about this stuff, and she just couldn't get it.
[00:58:20.839 --> 00:58:22.060]  So I had to leave.
[00:58:22.621 --> 00:58:24.483]  I had to leave her, and I had to leave everybody.
[00:58:24.783 --> 00:58:25.444]  And here I am.
[00:58:25.464 --> 00:58:27.926]  I'm in Bulgaria, and I just wanted to say that
[00:58:29.885 --> 00:58:42.228]  Uh, you know, in the future, uh, when all these Christians, these Christians and Jews that are being killed, um, I'm being put here, so, uh, I don't, I don't want to say where I am, but they can come here and they can be safe.
[00:58:42.288 --> 00:58:52.091]  In Northern Bulgaria, I have this place here that I'm preparing with, with food, water, I'm, uh... Well, brother, that's exciting, and you know, upload videos to YouTube from Bulgaria.
[00:58:52.551 --> 00:58:57.012]  Anybody can go out and independently report and say, as an affiliate, I'm reporting
[00:58:58.447 --> 00:58:59.848]  ForInfoWars.com.
[00:58:59.888 --> 00:59:03.709]  For liability, it doesn't mean that people can go set us up, that you actually work for us.
[00:59:03.729 --> 00:59:06.050]  You can just say, I'm here reporting independently.
[00:59:06.110 --> 00:59:07.330]  ForInfoWars.com.
[00:59:07.610 --> 00:59:10.291]  And if it's good, we'll play it right.
[00:59:10.411 --> 00:59:13.812]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:59:13.832 --> 00:59:15.873]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:59:19.716 --> 00:59:28.722]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:59:28.802 --> 00:59:37.047]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:59:37.207 --> 00:59:41.910]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:59:42.110 --> 00:59:48.454]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:59:48.874 --> 00:59:55.959]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:59:56.039 --> 01:00:02.923]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:00:03.063 --> 01:00:07.426]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:00:07.546 --> 01:00:10.768]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[01:00:10.928 --> 01:00:17.075]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[01:00:17.235 --> 01:00:18.937]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:00:22.861 --> 01:00:24.783]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:25.243 --> 01:00:28.047]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:32.714 --> 01:00:33.334]  Big Brother.
[01:00:34.015 --> 01:00:35.035]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:35.775 --> 01:00:36.896]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:37.536 --> 01:00:38.357]  You want answers?
[01:00:39.097 --> 01:00:40.037]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:40.678 --> 01:00:44.380]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:49.002]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:01:00.018 --> 01:01:06.842]  Dr. Edward Grube, one of the smartest people I know, is going to be joining us, coming up to cover a host of issues in the next segment.
[01:01:07.962 --> 01:01:17.207]  Then we've got another doctor coming on, brain surgeon, medical doctor, who pretty much comes with the same analysis as Dr. Grube, Dr. Russell Blaylock, a hard to get guest.
[01:01:17.227 --> 01:01:17.987]  We appreciate him coming on.
[01:01:18.007 --> 01:01:27.092]  We'll talk about Obamacare and how his predictions of what it would do, I thought were a little over the top, to show how naive I am, and exactly
[01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:31.021]  What Blaylock said is now happening.
[01:01:31.341 --> 01:01:35.683]  You can go back to the interviews four years ago, two years ago, a year ago, six months ago.
[01:01:36.123 --> 01:01:41.245]  I mean, it is precisely, precisely.
[01:01:41.265 --> 01:01:46.007]  By the way, Dr. Blaylock goes, and we went and covered him in Las Vegas.
[01:01:46.308 --> 01:01:51.790]  There was like 2,000 medical doctors and scientists there paying huge amounts of money just to hear him speak for two hours.
[01:01:53.455 --> 01:02:04.240]  He developed all the stuff that's common literature now, like cytotoxins and all these terms that he literally 25, 30 years ago researched and coined are now like mainline.
[01:02:04.740 --> 01:02:07.902]  He invented a bunch of the top brain surgeries used today.
[01:02:07.922 --> 01:02:10.603]  I'm not trying to go into a worship fest of Blaylock.
[01:02:11.343 --> 01:02:13.184]  It's just that he is amazing.
[01:02:13.224 --> 01:02:18.246]  He's going to be joining us coming up in the third hour because I don't have the staff.
[01:02:18.667 --> 01:02:19.327]  If I had the money,
[01:02:20.330 --> 01:02:31.995]  I would have people that just chronicled, in a word search, I guess we're kind of doing that now, everything we talk about and what our guests say and predict, show that we could then just go right back to it and pull it, you know, with like a word search.
[01:02:32.016 --> 01:02:35.337]  At this point, in the video, or in the audio, they said this.
[01:02:35.357 --> 01:02:37.078]  And then we could go back and find it.
[01:02:38.338 --> 01:02:41.180]  By the way, I mentioned this earlier, but we were able to find it.
[01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:45.382]  Bush, in January of 2009, when Obama was president-elect,
[01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:50.180]  He was saying, you know, I like Obama.
[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:52.141]  We've been playing golf and hanging out.
[01:02:52.721 --> 01:02:53.561]  You know what's great about it?
[01:02:53.721 --> 01:02:58.362]  Obama, as things collapse and get really bad, he's not going to go, oh, woe is me, and cry about it.
[01:02:59.222 --> 01:03:00.683]  He's just going to, you know, deal with it.
[01:03:01.123 --> 01:03:04.724]  And it was all an inside, oh my gosh, they're going to drop the hammer on everybody.
[01:03:05.204 --> 01:03:06.584]  This is the controlled implosion.
[01:03:06.864 --> 01:03:10.665]  I mean, they're right out there telling you what they're going to do to you.
[01:03:11.405 --> 01:03:15.106]  And if you play ball with them, you can be like Bill Clinton and keep half the money
[01:03:15.939 --> 01:03:31.127]  That he collected for the charity in Haiti, and he uses it for his $40,000 one-way trip luxury $50 million jet he flies on.
[01:03:33.048 --> 01:03:35.089]  So you give money for little black kids in Haiti?
[01:03:36.030 --> 01:03:43.994]  It literally goes into the pocket of the pig, Clinton, when he flies to Japan to get paid a half million dollars to get a delayed payoff.
[01:03:44.014 --> 01:03:45.075]  That's how they do it, is speeches.
[01:03:46.095 --> 01:03:53.843]  Or he flies, you know, to London to be paid a million dollars, or flies to a university to be paid a hundred thousand dollars is his lowest thing for universities.
[01:03:54.544 --> 01:04:07.238]  He flies on a private jet with his hookers, and all his drugs and the rest of it, paid for by poor people that sent in money to help Haitian kids.
[01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:11.702]  It's just so sick.
[01:04:12.422 --> 01:04:23.437]  And then you've got Foxconn, the worst factories in China, many studies have shown, where they have a urinal under the women and the men and you have to defecate and urinate at your chair.
[01:04:25.970 --> 01:04:33.315]  And then they've got suicide nets and they drug you and they do forced pregnancy tests and do a forced abortions right there in the factory.
[01:04:33.515 --> 01:04:40.020]  And then you stay in these Warren 200 square foot, well actually in some areas you actually get in a coffin and they slide you into the wall.
[01:04:40.060 --> 01:04:40.720]  I'm not joking.
[01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:42.401]  So actually 200 square foot's for us here now.
[01:04:42.862 --> 01:04:43.982]  That's where they're gonna raise the taxes.
[01:04:44.002 --> 01:04:45.143]  We have to live in a 200 square foot.
[01:04:45.804 --> 01:04:47.965]  That's Bloomberg, San Francisco, New York are doing it.
[01:04:48.405 --> 01:04:50.367]  Actually there it's coffin size.
[01:04:50.427 --> 01:04:51.267]  I'm sorry, it's smaller.
[01:04:51.287 --> 01:04:53.109]  And they put you in these coffins in the wall.
[01:04:53.749 --> 01:04:57.675]  And then you defecate and urinate standing there at the thing, and they put you on drugs.
[01:04:58.155 --> 01:04:59.837]  And of course, they're getting ready to replace him with robots.
[01:05:00.118 --> 01:05:03.442]  But because Al Gore is on the board of Apple, it's like, oh, that's nice.
[01:05:03.963 --> 01:05:08.209]  If you're against, you know, the Chinese being used as slaves, you're racist against them.
[01:05:09.930 --> 01:05:12.573]  Again, they didn't industrialize China to empower the Chinese people.
[01:05:12.813 --> 01:05:18.039]  They did it to enslave them and use them up, while the Communist Party pigs sit up there perched on everyone.
[01:05:18.399 --> 01:05:26.989]  If you want a good economy, you're like Henry Ford, who paid people about ten times what the regular factory wages were, and he said, I want people to have money to buy my cars.
[01:05:29.755 --> 01:05:40.139]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[01:05:40.439 --> 01:05:42.300]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:43.181]  Fluoride!
[01:05:43.381 --> 01:05:44.961]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[01:05:45.301 --> 01:05:51.604]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[01:05:51.864 --> 01:05:56.667]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[01:05:56.787 --> 01:06:02.910]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[01:06:03.110 --> 01:06:05.292]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[01:06:05.532 --> 01:06:08.153]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[01:06:08.473 --> 01:06:11.835]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[01:06:11.975 --> 01:06:17.198]  You will find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at Infowarslife.com.
[01:06:17.418 --> 01:06:20.540]  Infowarslife Survival Shield Nascent Iodine
[01:06:22.721 --> 01:06:32.505]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[01:06:32.785 --> 01:06:37.627]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:06:37.787 --> 01:06:44.970]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[01:06:45.350 --> 01:06:50.516]  Now we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.

[01:08:36.094 --> 01:08:37.135]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:37.856 --> 01:08:38.957]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:39.598 --> 01:08:40.399]  You want answers?
[01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:42.041]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:42.701 --> 01:08:46.285]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:46.866 --> 01:08:50.910]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:09:06.138 --> 01:09:12.721]  Ladies and gentlemen, a lot of people think that the essence of tyranny is black uniforms, cameras, drones, secret police.
[01:09:12.761 --> 01:09:14.021]  And yes, we've got all that.
[01:09:14.421 --> 01:09:18.703]  And a government that runs Al Qaeda publicly and uses the threat of Al Qaeda to take our liberties.
[01:09:18.743 --> 01:09:25.886]  And a government that has the IRS persecuting gun groups, veterans groups, Christian groups, pro-life groups, alternative medicine groups.
[01:09:26.506 --> 01:09:27.947]  I mean, you name it, the tyranny's there.
[01:09:28.347 --> 01:09:29.927]  The examples of corruption are legion.
[01:09:29.947 --> 01:09:30.928]  But even in Congress,
[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:34.342]  We got a special report coming up on the nightly news tonight.
[01:09:34.682 --> 01:09:35.923]  There's a bunch of examples of this.
[01:09:35.943 --> 01:09:41.327]  We're having hearings now about the executive branch being a dictatorship.
[01:09:42.869 --> 01:09:44.610]  Oh, I'll just make the illegals legal.
[01:09:45.831 --> 01:09:46.431]  I'm the president.
[01:09:46.471 --> 01:09:46.992]  I'm God.
[01:09:47.092 --> 01:09:48.393]  I'll just put us under NATO.
[01:09:48.633 --> 01:09:49.293]  We can't do that.
[01:09:49.333 --> 01:09:50.074]  It's unconstitutional.
[01:09:50.394 --> 01:09:51.255]  I'll do whatever I want.
[01:09:51.595 --> 01:09:56.959]  I'll just shut down all the power plants that General Electric doesn't own and double and triple their profits.
[01:09:57.820 --> 01:09:58.340]  I'll just
[01:10:00.677 --> 01:10:09.162]  Put carbon taxes in a regulation about microwaves that isn't even law, and then put carbon tax on everybody's carbon expenditure.
[01:10:10.383 --> 01:10:11.364]  Obama did that this year.
[01:10:12.865 --> 01:10:14.426]  And it's just now added to your bill.
[01:10:15.346 --> 01:10:16.867]  He didn't even sign an executive order!
[01:10:17.668 --> 01:10:21.030]  I mean, they could start interpreting his flatulence if they wanted to.
[01:10:21.931 --> 01:10:30.296]  And, you know, have some tea reader, a tea leaf reader, that's how the ancients did it, they would take like bones and put in a fire, and how the bones broke, they would go,
[01:10:30.656 --> 01:10:37.220]  They would go to the Oracle of Delphi, some woman breathing in obnoxious gases, hallucinating stuff.
[01:10:37.460 --> 01:10:39.501]  Really, they had the people behind them telling her what to say.
[01:10:39.561 --> 01:10:40.602]  It's political manipulation.
[01:10:40.842 --> 01:10:50.408]  But my point is, is that they could, you know, run the country, according to Obama, going out and looking at a butchered bull every morning and reading its intestines.
[01:10:50.428 --> 01:10:51.688]  That's what the Romans would do.
[01:10:51.708 --> 01:10:56.031]  I mean, it's literally God-Emperor type stuff has begun.
[01:10:56.849 --> 01:11:03.351]  And Congress, I played a clip earlier, is having hearings going, well actually the president's been set for the executive to be a dictator.
[01:11:04.231 --> 01:11:06.091]  And now suddenly everything's executive.
[01:11:06.651 --> 01:11:07.312]  Exactly.
[01:11:07.832 --> 01:11:10.792]  We're now going into a dictatorship.
[01:11:11.193 --> 01:11:13.833]  And let me show you a headline up at DrudgeReport.com right now.
[01:11:14.533 --> 01:11:16.174]  No one says it like Drudge does.
[01:11:17.214 --> 01:11:21.397]  Dirty Harry, that's Harry Reid, exempts staff from Obamacare.
[01:11:21.677 --> 01:11:23.599]  And, by the way, now admits there are death panels.
[01:11:24.619 --> 01:11:26.080]  Because it's now law, suckers.
[01:11:26.821 --> 01:11:28.422]  And that is from CNN.
[01:11:29.743 --> 01:11:36.748]  That's right, one of the main architects in the Senate of it admits that his people are exempt.
[01:11:36.808 --> 01:11:38.629]  And again, that's the real essence.
[01:11:38.949 --> 01:11:41.131]  At the bottom of tyranny is that
[01:11:43.973 --> 01:11:45.735]  Four legs bad, two legs good.
[01:11:46.035 --> 01:11:48.438]  To use the George Orwell animal farm analogy.
[01:11:48.578 --> 01:11:51.622]  Because it started out with the pigs, the horses and other animals.
[01:11:51.662 --> 01:11:52.843]  Let's revolt against the humans.
[01:11:53.985 --> 01:11:55.326]  Four legs good, two legs bad.
[01:11:55.346 --> 01:11:59.070]  But by the time the pigs were done and run the humans off with the horses' help...
[01:11:59.980 --> 01:12:04.504]  They were inside the house, dressing like humans, saying two legs good, four legs bad.
[01:12:04.965 --> 01:12:06.466]  And that's what they're doing.
[01:12:06.907 --> 01:12:07.888]  It's totally illegal.
[01:12:08.588 --> 01:12:13.693]  My dad came into work today to visit me and was showing me his insurance.
[01:12:14.354 --> 01:12:16.716]  It went up 30-something percent two months ago.
[01:12:17.891 --> 01:12:18.371]  So he's lucky.
[01:12:18.391 --> 01:12:25.355]  A lot of people's double, triple, quadrupled, or 500 and something percent in Texas with Humana for families with no pre-existing conditions.
[01:12:25.375 --> 01:12:26.716]  And he got another letter.
[01:12:26.776 --> 01:12:28.497]  It's up 30 percent again.
[01:12:29.177 --> 01:12:30.138]  So that's how they're doing it.
[01:12:30.178 --> 01:12:32.579]  Every few months it goes up 30 something percent.
[01:12:33.260 --> 01:12:35.541]  My dad's never used his insurance.
[01:12:36.732 --> 01:12:38.214]  For whatever reason, I learned this from him.
[01:12:38.234 --> 01:12:41.759]  I don't know why he does it, but I guess he keeps your insurance down.
[01:12:41.779 --> 01:12:43.962]  When he goes to the doctor once in a while for a checkup, he just pays cash.
[01:12:45.003 --> 01:12:45.925]  It doesn't matter.
[01:12:45.945 --> 01:12:47.928]  That still gets filed with him through the surveillance system.
[01:12:49.206 --> 01:12:50.767]  And that's what Obama cares about as well.
[01:12:50.847 --> 01:12:52.629]  Tracking everything you do, feeding it back.
[01:12:52.789 --> 01:12:55.031]  This is the mega total rip-off.
[01:12:55.131 --> 01:13:01.036]  And it's designed to try to stop alternative medicine from getting any kind of Medicare, Medicaid, or insurance money.
[01:13:01.957 --> 01:13:03.818]  It's designed to lower the quality of care.
[01:13:04.639 --> 01:13:12.245]  And it's designed to let insurance companies, in some cases, charge 11 times what they did previous and not cover pre-existing conditions.
[01:13:13.066 --> 01:13:17.410]  And all these morons that are in the news going, well, 10% of America was able to sign up.
[01:13:18.049 --> 01:13:19.650]  They're now going in going, I signed up!
[01:13:19.771 --> 01:13:20.451]  I'm in the system!
[01:13:20.671 --> 01:13:22.333]  They go, well, we can't even get on a system.
[01:13:22.353 --> 01:13:23.053]  You're not signed up.
[01:13:23.334 --> 01:13:24.295]  Where's your insurance card?
[01:13:24.835 --> 01:13:25.636]  They go, it's free!
[01:13:25.716 --> 01:13:26.216]  Obama!
[01:13:27.237 --> 01:13:28.278]  I got an Obama phone.
[01:13:28.358 --> 01:13:29.319]  Now I get Obamacare.
[01:13:30.460 --> 01:13:33.022]  And they look at them and they go, there is no free healthcare.
[01:13:33.323 --> 01:13:35.885]  There was previous under charity care, under law.
[01:13:36.445 --> 01:13:37.927]  We've pretty much gotten rid of that now.
[01:13:38.507 --> 01:13:42.471]  Some doctors are still trying to do it, but they're being told by the big management companies you can't.
[01:13:43.513 --> 01:13:52.779]  Just like it came out in the news yesterday, I saw it on Drudge2, that small banks and credit unions are being shut down under the banking regs that were supposed to fix the megabanks.
[01:13:53.099 --> 01:13:55.460]  The megabanks wrote that to shut down their competition.
[01:13:55.680 --> 01:14:01.244]  They got unlimited bailout money now, and then the local bank can't do fractional reserve banking, so they're shutting down.
[01:14:01.784 --> 01:14:03.345]  They don't want you to get money.
[01:14:03.505 --> 01:14:04.746]  They want a fixed system.
[01:14:04.986 --> 01:14:06.107]  Comprende?
[01:14:07.797 --> 01:14:09.538]  All you're gonna get is a screw job.
[01:14:09.718 --> 01:14:20.146]  They got you addicted to government, and the NFL distractions, and the opiate of the masses, the gladiatorial diversions, and now they fattened us up, and now it's butchering time!
[01:14:23.648 --> 01:14:31.093]  And many of you will settle for 10% of the chicken feed you've been getting by the time they're done, instead of being free and wealthy and prosperous.
[01:14:31.333 --> 01:14:32.614]  You want slavery.
[01:14:32.834 --> 01:14:33.955]  You love slavery.
[01:14:34.195 --> 01:14:36.537]  And the system thinks that you're ready now.
[01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:41.402]  You'll eat GMO, you'll drink all the poison, you'll do whatever you... Well, why not?
[01:14:41.642 --> 01:14:42.882]  Why not just take your pension funds?
[01:14:43.122 --> 01:14:44.703]  Why not spy on everybody without warrants?
[01:14:44.903 --> 01:14:46.084]  Why not set up checkpoints?
[01:14:46.584 --> 01:14:49.345]  Why not cut babies out of women's wombs for CPS now?
[01:14:49.665 --> 01:14:55.848]  Why not have the FBI persecute the Tea Party under orders from the White House and it comes out and no one gets in trouble?
[01:14:55.868 --> 01:15:01.611]  That's how Hitler started, was just persecuting his political opposition with regulations and audits and things.
[01:15:03.154 --> 01:15:09.460]  And so I wanted to get Dr. Ed Group in here with us because, man, I tell you, none of us are perfect.
[01:15:09.740 --> 01:15:14.865]  I have a vision of what I want in my life, but I obviously can't get there overnight.
[01:15:15.606 --> 01:15:20.070]  I thought they'd kill me any time for a decade, so I just ate like a pig, was totally unhealthy.
[01:15:20.811 --> 01:15:25.835]  And because I've been physically attacked and death-threatened a lot, and I just thought, well, you know, why even worry about what I look like or feel like?
[01:15:25.875 --> 01:15:27.096]  Now I realize it's long haul.
[01:15:28.103 --> 01:15:35.475]  Tommy Pallotta, movie producer, friend of mine, he said, Alex, that's how they really kill you, is making you think they're going to kill you, and then you just don't care about yourself.
[01:15:35.655 --> 01:15:36.536]  You're killing yourself.
[01:15:36.917 --> 01:15:41.264]  So it's taken me about five, six years to lose 40-something pounds to get healthier.
[01:15:43.687 --> 01:15:46.449]  And I weighed 275 pounds at the height of it, folks.
[01:15:46.609 --> 01:15:50.292]  I'm still a little bit overweight, but actually standing there out of the shower, I got a little bit of fat on my stomach.
[01:15:50.312 --> 01:15:51.573]  I just got a long torso.
[01:15:51.593 --> 01:15:52.614]  I actually look pretty good now.
[01:15:53.435 --> 01:15:54.736]  I don't look that good on TV.
[01:15:54.776 --> 01:15:55.516]  It puts weight on you.
[01:15:55.556 --> 01:15:58.399]  But the point is, is that my brain works so much better.
[01:15:59.543 --> 01:16:06.608]  And I've gotten into supplementation and tried to research the last three, four years in this process of detoxing, trying to get my life straight.
[01:16:07.249 --> 01:16:12.452]  And I finally found Dr. Group and the things he was doing.
[01:16:12.933 --> 01:16:18.416]  And I learned stuff from him that I didn't hear from anybody else that has just been absolutely miraculous.
[01:16:18.456 --> 01:16:20.818]  Like he helped us develop this only form.
[01:16:20.878 --> 01:16:21.519]  It's the only form.
[01:16:21.539 --> 01:16:23.220]  It's totally proprietary of nascent iodine.
[01:16:24.167 --> 01:16:28.009]  That is totally bioavailable and absorbed by the body, not bound.
[01:16:28.609 --> 01:16:30.150]  And other iodine is great as well.
[01:16:30.210 --> 01:16:33.312]  I mean, it's just this is the best stuff from my research.
[01:16:33.332 --> 01:16:36.933]  And of course, that helps us fund our operation as well, Infowarslife.com.
[01:16:37.814 --> 01:16:45.118]  But I wanted to get him in here to talk about this big stack of news where Harvard now admits fluoride decreases IQ.
[01:16:46.998 --> 01:16:50.319]  Areas in Germany, the Netherlands, all over are moving fluoride, so good news.
[01:16:50.339 --> 01:17:04.925]  And then we're going to get into some other systems of detox with him as well, because the real revolution here is that they're targeting our bodies so that we're so poisoned that we can't even get upset or motivated to resist them.
[01:17:04.985 --> 01:17:06.846]  So the revolution starts with our bodies.
[01:17:07.226 --> 01:17:09.187]  It starts with getting our kids out of the public schools.
[01:17:09.727 --> 01:17:14.549]  It starts with decoupling from the system, not caring what Hollywood and the media say, and that's happening.
[01:17:15.149 --> 01:17:16.730]  Congress has a 6% approval rating.
[01:17:17.511 --> 01:17:26.136]  The mainstream media is dying, but we've got to go all the way and not just leave Babylon, not just come out of Egypt, but actually build a new promised land.
[01:17:27.321 --> 01:17:29.523]  And there is no silver bullet, but there's a process.
[01:17:29.643 --> 01:17:33.105]  And Dr. Ed Group joins us here today in studio.
[01:17:33.145 --> 01:17:38.849]  Advisor to Infowarshealth.com, Infowarslife.com, and of course, Infowars.com.
[01:17:39.789 --> 01:17:40.950]  And he's here with us today.
[01:17:41.450 --> 01:17:45.593]  You've heard my rant about Obamacare and how the government and the corporations are exempt.
[01:17:45.873 --> 01:17:48.215]  I mean, is that not the ultimate form of discrimination?
[01:17:48.515 --> 01:17:50.677]  Of course, they're screaming racism all day.
[01:17:51.037 --> 01:17:56.841]  If you love liberty as a distraction, because they're actually cheating all of us that aren't on the inside group.
[01:17:57.841 --> 01:18:03.504]  It's been going on for a long time when they started putting fluoride in the water and everything else and poisoning the air and poisoning the food.
[01:18:03.564 --> 01:18:11.428]  But today, you know, if you look at the combination of chemicals that we're exposed to every day, I mean, fluoride is so toxic.
[01:18:11.528 --> 01:18:19.652]  I mean, the hydrofluorosilicic acid that they put in the water supply, if you have a hard time saying that, you just automatically know it's a poison.
[01:18:19.672 --> 01:18:21.433]  I mean, it's almost as poisonous as arsenic.
[01:18:22.384 --> 01:18:24.565]  So, what I try to do is tell people it's everywhere.
[01:18:24.585 --> 01:18:27.146]  I mean, if you go to Starbucks and get some coffee, you're drinking fluoride.
[01:18:27.166 --> 01:18:28.986]  If you drink beer, you're drinking fluoride.
[01:18:29.506 --> 01:18:34.428]  Wine, all the food that you make, the bread that you eat, all of it has to be made with water, right?
[01:18:34.468 --> 01:18:37.649]  I mean, the water that you're spraying on your yard, your organic garden.
[01:18:38.209 --> 01:18:39.409]  Plus, they add it to the bread.
[01:18:41.690 --> 01:18:43.611]  Prescription medications have fluoride in them.
[01:18:43.631 --> 01:18:44.491]  I mean, you're right.
[01:18:44.632 --> 01:18:51.655]  It's designed to dumb you down, to make you non-motivated and non-aggressive.
[01:18:51.995 --> 01:18:58.739]  So really, what I want to talk about is how people can address that and how people can reduce that because there's a million chemicals we could pick out there.
[01:18:58.779 --> 01:19:06.983]  But really, if you take like the top five, I mean, they know, and it's been in the water system and it's been everywhere for so long, how detrimental fluoride is.
[01:19:07.603 --> 01:19:15.548]  It wasn't until, like for example, if you stick your hand in hydrofluorosilic acid, you will die just because you came in contact with it.
[01:19:15.608 --> 01:19:16.728]  That's how poisonous it is.
[01:19:16.768 --> 01:19:17.909]  You can't breathe the gases.
[01:19:18.489 --> 01:19:24.813]  So, it was funny that Anthony Gucciardi mentioned in late 2012, you know, well, what is out there?
[01:19:24.873 --> 01:19:28.415]  I mean, what, can you develop a product that will get rid of fluoride inside the system?
[01:19:28.975 --> 01:19:30.256]  I was like, you know what, that's a great idea.
[01:19:30.276 --> 01:19:31.777]  That's right, it's Gucciardi that came up with it.
[01:19:31.937 --> 01:19:46.770]  Yeah, so I said, you know, I've got about a two-year waiting list for product development, but I was like, wait a second, if you can address the main chemical that's dumbing people down, the, you know, reducing the IQs of children, you know, the list goes on and on, and you've talked about it for years and years.
[01:19:47.530 --> 01:19:52.455]  What if we could develop a product that would actually help the body detoxify fluoride?
[01:19:52.595 --> 01:19:57.139]  And, you know, with the survival shield, with the iodine product that we came up with, that's great because
[01:19:57.839 --> 01:20:00.841]  The iodine saturates the thyroid and it doesn't let the fluoride in.
[01:20:01.461 --> 01:20:14.209]  But what about something that we could use and take on a regular basis to protect the children and techniques on how to avoid fluoride from coming into the... That's right, we're going to talk about that today because we are launching the new product today.
[01:20:14.229 --> 01:20:20.994]  We're only going to spend about five minutes on that and get into news and analysis, folks, but this is amazing because Dr. Group, off record, said, hey,
[01:20:22.185 --> 01:20:29.648]  When you gotta be on coast to coast AM or something, you gotta stay up all night, try not drinking coffee, try taking a double dose of the iodine, and it literally is a brain booster for me.
[01:20:30.448 --> 01:20:32.009]  Great news, pure water lovers!

[01:23:29.278 --> 01:23:30.138]  The facts are in.
[01:23:30.318 --> 01:23:31.459]  The studies are legion.
[01:23:31.719 --> 01:23:39.081]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[01:23:39.221 --> 01:23:42.702]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[01:23:43.042 --> 01:23:43.462]  Simple.
[01:23:43.622 --> 01:23:48.023]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[01:23:48.343 --> 01:23:53.785]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[01:23:54.065 --> 01:23:59.429]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield formulation.
[01:23:59.589 --> 01:24:10.056]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[01:24:10.376 --> 01:24:14.640]  Let's take a stand against the Globalist by blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.
[01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:16.821]  I use Fluoride Shield every day.

[01:24:27.090 --> 01:24:28.371]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:24:39.270 --> 01:24:47.916]  Now I want to get into Obamacare with Dr. Ed Grubb and all this news where cities and counties are pulling Florida out of the water in New Jersey and
[01:24:49.333 --> 01:25:03.478]  States like Arkansas, a whole bunch of them, so they're passing federal mandates of money to the states where the state doesn't get the federal money that's really state money, citizen money, if they don't fluoridate.
[01:25:03.498 --> 01:25:09.740]  So they're passing laws that the water's got to be fluoridated and public schools have to have it.
[01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:17.242]  When for seven years the American Dental Association and Medical Association have said under five don't drink it.
[01:25:18.422 --> 01:25:23.065]  And I've had arguments with doctors that don't know that, and they look it up and they go, oh my god, no one told me this.
[01:25:23.525 --> 01:25:25.727]  So we forced them to say, don't drink it.
[01:25:26.687 --> 01:25:29.209]  And the scientists at the FDA have gone public.
[01:25:29.509 --> 01:25:31.550]  God bless them, because that's an example of good people in government.
[01:25:32.011 --> 01:25:42.397]  In 2000, and again in 2009, 90 plus percent of them signed official deals, could have been fired, and said take it out, it's giving people cancer, thyroid, IQ, and they said no.
[01:25:42.998 --> 01:25:44.319]  So here's the deal, folks.
[01:25:45.479 --> 01:25:47.661]  I've actually got to commend the government scientists trying to get it out.
[01:25:48.962 --> 01:25:50.724]  It's the citizens sitting down on their butts.
[01:25:50.764 --> 01:25:51.465]  People should be angry.
[01:25:51.485 --> 01:25:52.145]  Sit down in a group.
[01:25:52.586 --> 01:25:54.608]  I want to get into fluoride and all that, but you've got the floor.
[01:25:54.968 --> 01:25:58.712]  We are launching fluoride shield, fluoride detox.
[01:25:58.972 --> 01:26:00.294]  But it doesn't just detox that.
[01:26:00.754 --> 01:26:02.396]  And it is the super combo.
[01:26:03.484 --> 01:26:06.427]  Because Gucci already had this idea, as you said, a couple years ago.
[01:26:06.727 --> 01:26:09.989]  You were so busy, I should also add, you're one of the major formulators in the country.
[01:26:10.390 --> 01:26:16.535]  You yourself have lines of stuff that are your national bestsellers, and are really, I guess, Nutramedical, I guess they'd call them.
[01:26:16.555 --> 01:26:18.096]  They're used in hospitals, you name it.
[01:26:18.416 --> 01:26:22.700]  But the whole point is, is I appreciate you helping us do this, because you're on board with the Liberty Movement.
[01:26:23.401 --> 01:26:29.986]  Tell us about how you developed, and are allowing us to be the sole proprietary distributor of it, Fluoride Shield.
[01:26:30.146 --> 01:26:30.787]  Tell us what's in it.
[01:26:32.039 --> 01:26:41.748]  First of all, it's just an incredible idea and so I really wanted to put a lot of effort into it and spend a lot of time researching it because ultimately I want to help everybody out just like you.
[01:26:41.788 --> 01:26:49.555]  And by the way, you couldn't get one of the ingredients for about six months and this all got held up and I said, just take it out.
[01:26:49.816 --> 01:26:53.199]  You said, no, I will not put it out unless it's, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:26:53.579 --> 01:26:58.783]  No, that's exactly what it was, and the ingredient was Shilajit, and it actually is a black mass.
[01:26:58.863 --> 01:27:02.565]  It's an organic mass that grows out of the mountains in the Himalayas.
[01:27:03.005 --> 01:27:06.468]  So they actually have to go up there and harvest it at a certain time of the year.
[01:27:06.488 --> 01:27:09.930]  It's like a black ooze, and they harvest it, and it's very high in minerals.
[01:27:10.010 --> 01:27:13.632]  And it's been used in Ayurvedic for thousands and thousands of years.
[01:27:13.693 --> 01:27:15.914]  It's a miraculous healing compound.
[01:27:16.574 --> 01:27:22.598]  But it's high in fulvic acid and has the ability to help chelate and pull metals and toxic compounds out of the system.
[01:27:23.719 --> 01:27:25.240]  That was one of the main ingredients.
[01:27:25.620 --> 01:27:27.440]  And by the way, these ingredients are hard to get.
[01:27:27.480 --> 01:27:29.501]  I've got organic fulvic acid in there.
[01:27:29.961 --> 01:27:35.343]  I've got tamarind, which a lot of people don't know about, and that mobilizes metals and fluorides from the body.
[01:27:35.403 --> 01:27:36.083]  Nascent iodine.
[01:27:36.123 --> 01:27:38.384]  Montreux, and then iodine in there as well.
[01:27:38.464 --> 01:27:43.746]  Not a lot like the survival shield, but you can actually take the fluoride shield and the survival shield at the same time.
[01:27:43.766 --> 01:27:46.327]  And you explained how it all triggers it.
[01:27:46.467 --> 01:27:48.908]  One thing gets it moving, the other grabs it.
[01:27:48.928 --> 01:27:49.328]  Explain it.
[01:27:49.488 --> 01:27:57.978]  Yes, well it's got zeolites in it too and so basically what we want to do is we want to take something that's going to target toxic chemicals, especially fluoride.
[01:27:58.058 --> 01:28:08.970]  Some of it, like cilantro, is going to mobilize it from the cells and then the zeolites are going to pick it up and the fulvic acid is also going to chelate it or bond to it so you can extract it normally from the body.
[01:28:09.791 --> 01:28:19.055]  So, uh, you know, especially with the dental fluorosis, the skeletal fluorosis, people losing hair, arthritis, joint pains all over the United States.
[01:28:19.215 --> 01:28:28.219]  I mean, one of the best things when he came up with that idea was like, that's great because that's the one thing that you can really turn you around super fast.
[01:28:28.259 --> 01:28:30.980]  I mean, as far as health is concerned, because you need to.
[01:28:32.180 --> 01:28:44.344]  Be able to understand and have mental clarity if you want to fight against the opposition, if you want to fight against everything else, and if you want, especially with the Obamacare situation right now, people need to start taking responsibility for their own health.
[01:28:44.784 --> 01:28:50.465]  They need to start cleaning their body, they need to start detoxifying, and they need to be aware of the things that they're putting in their system.
[01:28:50.485 --> 01:28:59.088]  And you warned us on air, and you warned me, because I took it for several months, just the proprietary nascent iodine, before we actually bottled it and put it out.
[01:29:00.143 --> 01:29:00.363]  Yeah.
[01:29:23.101 --> 01:29:24.221]  I will hit the iodine.
[01:29:24.241 --> 01:29:25.482]  And of course, you've got to consult a physician.
[01:29:25.782 --> 01:29:27.522]  Sometimes I take more than what it says recommended.
[01:29:27.822 --> 01:29:29.342]  You told me privately what you really take.
[01:29:29.362 --> 01:29:30.883]  And I was like, man, is this guy crazy?
[01:29:30.903 --> 01:29:32.343]  Let me tell you, this stuff's amazing.
[01:29:33.343 --> 01:29:36.764]  Well, it's easy to tell people avoid artificial sweeteners, avoid alcohol.
[01:29:36.804 --> 01:29:37.564]  You know, they can avoid it.
[01:29:37.624 --> 01:29:39.885]  But it's hard to tell people to avoid fluoride.
[01:29:39.945 --> 01:29:40.665]  Because what?
[01:29:40.765 --> 01:29:42.905]  Are you going to not go out to the restaurant and eat anymore?
[01:29:42.925 --> 01:29:44.366]  Are you not going to have water anywhere?
[01:29:44.526 --> 01:29:46.746]  All the foods made with water, the soup, I mean, everything.
[01:29:46.806 --> 01:29:48.447]  It's hard to avoid fluoride.
[01:29:48.907 --> 01:29:49.527]  It's in everything.
[01:29:49.967 --> 01:29:58.010]  So, that's why I figured it's a great idea to have a product that someone can take on a regular basis that will actually help them immobilize and eliminate fluoride.
[01:29:58.030 --> 01:30:00.431]  What is it doing in the brain, though, for the clarity?
[01:30:00.591 --> 01:30:01.712]  I mean, it's amazing.
[01:30:01.732 --> 01:30:01.992]  What is it?
[01:30:02.012 --> 01:30:11.436]  What it's doing is it's decalcifying the pineal gland, number one, which is bringing your consciousness up and making you more aware and giving you a more spiritual connection.
[01:30:11.896 --> 01:30:14.317]  And then... It's undoubtedly the dreams I'm having.
[01:30:14.777 --> 01:30:16.718]  I mean, quite frankly, this stuff's amazing.
[01:30:16.838 --> 01:30:17.598]  I don't know.
[01:30:17.618 --> 01:30:18.299]  We're going to be right back.
[01:30:19.079 --> 01:30:19.999]  We're on the march.
[01:30:20.480 --> 01:30:22.080]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:22.100 --> 01:30:25.802]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:29.764 --> 01:30:34.346]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[01:30:34.486 --> 01:30:37.447]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[01:30:37.587 --> 01:30:42.829]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[01:30:43.150 --> 01:30:44.810]  It all comes down to one thing.
[01:30:45.090 --> 01:30:46.391]  We are what we eat.
[01:30:46.731 --> 01:30:48.632]  Our food is devoid of nutrition.
[01:30:48.792 --> 01:30:49.652]  We're good to go.
[01:31:14.418 --> 01:31:20.227]  The fight against the New World Order starts with you, and you can't stand against the machine of your sick, tired, and obese.

[01:31:38.744 --> 01:31:46.848]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:31:47.148 --> 01:31:51.850]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:31:52.031 --> 01:31:58.754]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[01:31:58.814 --> 01:32:05.897]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:32:05.998 --> 01:32:12.861]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:32:13.021 --> 01:32:17.364]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:32:17.505 --> 01:32:20.767]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[01:32:20.887 --> 01:32:27.032]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[01:32:27.192 --> 01:32:29.434]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:32:29.614 --> 01:32:40.002]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[01:32:40.302 --> 01:32:42.144]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[01:32:42.324 --> 01:32:43.024]  Fluoride.
[01:32:43.224 --> 01:32:45.025]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[01:32:45.145 --> 01:32:51.446]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[01:32:51.707 --> 01:32:54.547]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table.
[01:32:54.667 --> 01:32:56.508]  And the results are on record.
[01:32:56.628 --> 01:33:02.750]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[01:33:02.950 --> 01:33:05.130]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[01:33:05.370 --> 01:33:07.991]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[01:33:08.291 --> 01:33:11.692]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[01:33:11.812 --> 01:33:17.034]  You will find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:33:17.234 --> 01:33:22.036]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.
[01:33:22.336 --> 01:33:23.396]  I take it every day.
[01:33:23.536 --> 01:33:26.397]  That's InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:33:42.318 --> 01:33:43.881]  We're good to go.
[01:33:59.233 --> 01:34:01.014]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:34:01.034 --> 01:34:01.474]  to 2 p.m.
[01:34:01.514 --> 01:34:23.046]  we're here live ladies and gentlemen and I don't know maybe once a month or so I have a guest on where we're plugging some products that funds our operation and what I do is I go out and research things for years and then what I use for myself and my family my children all take this my wife takes it she's like what on earth is this this is this really is doing what you're saying it's amazing
[01:34:23.726 --> 01:34:28.530]  Well, obviously, ProPure is the best gravity-fed filters out there that I could find.
[01:34:29.931 --> 01:34:41.860]  It cuts up the glyphosate for fluoride, so I sell that, I use it, and then you can block them putting the fluoride in your water, and be healthy, and we can fund the media operation.
[01:34:42.180 --> 01:34:43.000]  Win, win, win!
[01:34:43.261 --> 01:34:47.124]  That's just old-fashioned, free-market, good-products capitalism.
[01:34:47.144 --> 01:34:52.708]  You know, good karma, good re-put you sow, whatever you want to call it, folks, that's what I'm into.
[01:34:54.034 --> 01:34:55.516]  And again, I'm being honest about it.
[01:34:55.536 --> 01:34:57.778]  I'm like, well, it's got all these other five great ingredients.
[01:34:57.878 --> 01:34:58.999]  I'm sick of waiting.
[01:34:59.599 --> 01:35:05.885]  Let's call it, you know, fluoride shield turbo or something once I get the shilajit.
[01:35:06.666 --> 01:35:10.069]  Because he's like, well, we've got some good shilajit, but it's not the best.
[01:35:10.149 --> 01:35:11.451]  And I wanted this.
[01:35:11.531 --> 01:35:14.473]  And I'm like, look, I've been waiting six months here for this.
[01:35:15.763 --> 01:35:17.105]  Oh, and that's the final issue.
[01:35:17.165 --> 01:35:18.486]  They only got half the shillagee.
[01:35:18.526 --> 01:35:22.591]  They thought this is not a advertising tactic, though it is.
[01:35:22.831 --> 01:35:24.493]  Just the truth is what sells.
[01:35:24.914 --> 01:35:25.695]  But it is true.
[01:35:26.095 --> 01:35:32.382]  We got a third of what I originally wanted to order, and it's going to be four to six weeks till I get more.
[01:35:33.223 --> 01:35:38.847]  And so, I almost didn't even come out with it, just because it's pointless, because we're just going to sell out of it in like two days.
[01:35:39.488 --> 01:35:48.014]  But we have two new products, Super Mill Vitality and the Fluoride Shield, that will sell out in days, and we won't have more for four to six weeks.
[01:35:48.395 --> 01:35:48.515]  Okay?
[01:35:48.535 --> 01:35:49.395]  I mean, period.
[01:35:50.016 --> 01:35:50.296]  Period.
[01:35:50.316 --> 01:35:54.899]  So, I've been wanting to get Dr. Gruber in here anyways, so that's it.
[01:35:54.919 --> 01:35:57.121]  We have plenty, for now, of the
[01:35:58.797 --> 01:36:01.479]  Survival Shield's proprietary nascent iodine.
[01:36:02.119 --> 01:36:08.303]  And to give you an example, the other ones, which I'm sure are great for you and everything, are black on paper because they're oxidized and mixed with alcohol.
[01:36:08.683 --> 01:36:14.787]  This is bound up in the non-GMO from Germany, glycerin, and turns bright blue on paper.
[01:36:15.147 --> 01:36:19.130]  I'm just giving you an idea of the differences here, just visually what goes on.
[01:36:19.970 --> 01:36:33.336]  And we do have plenty of that at Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139 if you want to call and order it, and it's also good to store as well.
[01:36:33.376 --> 01:36:38.218]  But this is something you take daily, consult your physician, because a lot of you are super toxic like I was.
[01:36:38.238 --> 01:36:39.638]  I mean, this is not a game.
[01:36:40.258 --> 01:36:41.139]  This is not a joke.
[01:36:41.439 --> 01:36:42.639]  This is real stuff, okay?
[01:36:42.859 --> 01:36:43.880]  And what's blown me away
[01:36:45.351 --> 01:36:47.452]  Is that I'm like, listen, group is taking forever.
[01:36:47.492 --> 01:36:50.614]  Let's go find, I told group this, somewhere else to put this out.
[01:36:51.034 --> 01:37:05.181]  And I found out the industry is so unbelievable with fillers and all the rest of it that I could get stuff for like $2, ladies and gentlemen, instead of paying $16, you know, $20 a bottle myself or something to get the real stuff.
[01:37:05.881 --> 01:37:06.922]  And I went and did research.
[01:37:07.562 --> 01:37:12.985]  I mean, that's the difference with these companies and these fillers and even a lot of the stuff that's seen as super good and wonderful.
[01:37:14.693 --> 01:37:17.634]  And again, I don't need to differentiate the competition to sell this stuff.
[01:37:17.934 --> 01:37:23.276]  I'm telling you, folks, we're bringing you, from our research, the very best stuff.
[01:37:23.316 --> 01:37:24.176]  And I'm done plugging it.
[01:37:24.416 --> 01:37:25.236]  Let's get into fluoride.
[01:37:25.256 --> 01:37:30.838]  But let's finish up, Dr. Group, what you were telling me about what fluoride does, how it supercharges the body.
[01:37:31.238 --> 01:37:32.839]  The point is, this is available now.
[01:37:33.159 --> 01:37:35.800]  It'll be the middle of January until we have more of this, folks.
[01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:37.780]  And I'm not even getting into the super male vitality.
[01:37:37.800 --> 01:37:39.301]  We've got such a small amount of that.
[01:37:39.921 --> 01:37:45.065]  And I'll be honest with you folks, I took this when we had the formula three months ago, for about a month.
[01:37:45.605 --> 01:37:51.229]  I quit taking it, except for about a third of the even recommended dose, because I don't need the super-motility, okay?
[01:37:51.870 --> 01:37:57.494]  Okay, I don't need it in the morning, if you know what I mean, and I'm gonna literally start, I mean, I can't take it, okay?
[01:37:57.774 --> 01:38:06.101]  But for guys out there, let me tell you, the leading competitors are double the price, like a hundred bucks for this stuff, and our stuff's, you know, fifty-something.
[01:38:07.293 --> 01:38:08.034]  Or 60-something.
[01:38:08.494 --> 01:38:09.795]  Because the ingredients that are in it.
[01:38:10.275 --> 01:38:12.617]  And I'm telling you, I wanted to try all this stuff out.
[01:38:13.178 --> 01:38:15.139]  Other competitors don't do anything or give me a headache.
[01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:19.543]  This Super Mill Vitality, when we finally get enough of it, is going to be a market changer.
[01:38:19.863 --> 01:38:20.183]  Okay?
[01:38:20.744 --> 01:38:22.385]  The problem is, is that it's so hard to make.
[01:38:22.745 --> 01:38:24.907]  And again, group, why is it so hard to make good stuff?
[01:38:24.927 --> 01:38:25.667]  And then you've got the floor.
[01:38:26.768 --> 01:38:36.376]  Well, because nobody else out there takes the time and effort to research the ingredients and make sure that they mix everything correctly, that they use cold processing, that they use all glass equipment.
[01:38:36.416 --> 01:38:42.181]  I mean, most of the stuff out there is done in aluminum-based production vessels, stainless steel production vessels.
[01:38:42.321 --> 01:38:44.843]  All that can affect the way that it mixes together.
[01:38:44.983 --> 01:38:51.228]  People use alcohol extractions, which are dated back to, you know, thousands and thousands of years ago.
[01:38:51.288 --> 01:38:54.631]  No one's reinvented the way to process herbs
[01:38:55.271 --> 01:39:00.596]  Or came up with new technology and utilize new technology since we have, really.
[01:39:00.656 --> 01:39:04.539]  I mean, and that's like starting from scratch and figuring out how we can extract.
[01:39:04.879 --> 01:39:09.843]  Because, see, alcohol extractions only get about 40 to 50 percent of the constituents of the plant out.
[01:39:10.224 --> 01:39:11.565]  But what kind of pitch is that?
[01:39:11.645 --> 01:39:13.206]  Don't buy this, it's too strong.
[01:39:13.626 --> 01:39:16.689]  I mean, what is in the Super Mill Vitality separately?
[01:39:17.049 --> 01:39:23.835]  What's in the male vitality is a proprietary formula and I developed it because men everywhere are experiencing andropause right now.
[01:39:23.855 --> 01:39:25.236]  Because they're putting all the garbage in them.
[01:39:25.616 --> 01:39:31.781]  When you turn 30, your body, a male, their body starts producing more estrogen than testosterone.
[01:39:31.861 --> 01:39:38.446]  And we have a major problem with all the estrogen, soy, all the phytates, the plastics, everything that's mimicking estrogen.
[01:39:38.546 --> 01:39:40.868]  And actually talking about fluoride, it does the same thing.
[01:39:40.928 --> 01:39:41.449]  Fluoride
[01:39:41.949 --> 01:39:46.372]  Causes excess aluminum to be put up into the brain, which causes problems.
[01:39:46.753 --> 01:39:50.916]  And fluoride is associated with excess estrogen levels in the body too.
[01:39:51.236 --> 01:39:53.898]  And fluoride reduces sperm count.
[01:39:54.439 --> 01:39:57.401]  It reduces the reproductive area.
[01:39:57.501 --> 01:39:59.542]  Well that's why John P. Holdren says they put it in the water.
[01:39:59.843 --> 01:40:01.284]  It's for mainly infertility.
[01:40:01.804 --> 01:40:03.044]  To make you infertile, yeah.
[01:40:03.144 --> 01:40:07.205]  And what we have now is we have two women being, two girls being born for every one male.
[01:40:07.245 --> 01:40:10.406]  So they're trying to reduce the amount of males with the fluoride and all the other stuff.
[01:40:10.466 --> 01:40:11.066]  Unbelievable.
[01:40:11.686 --> 01:40:20.929]  With the male vitality, that was designed to bring you back to when you were a teenager again, bring you back to where you're 18, regulate and normalize your hormone levels, growth hormone.
[01:40:20.969 --> 01:40:22.009]  Why can't I handle it?
[01:40:23.635 --> 01:40:28.939]  Well, you're probably just, you're already a, like a dominant, you know, testosterone male.
[01:40:28.999 --> 01:40:38.325]  I mean, this is for, and, you know, you're only 39 too, so anytime after 40, you know, you're, as your levels continue to go, and plus, you're avoiding the estrogens.
[01:40:38.445 --> 01:40:40.467]  I was about to say, and I've been exercising.
[01:40:40.667 --> 01:40:43.829]  I mean, I still take it sometimes, like in the morning when I'm tired or don't want to work out or something.
[01:40:44.169 --> 01:40:46.651]  It's just that I did get crazed in about three weeks on this.
[01:40:47.233 --> 01:41:03.932]  Well, you have to look at your personality and you have to look at what, you know, if you're having fatigue, if you're having extra weight gain like males do around the trunk area, if you're eating a crappy diet with all kinds of estrogens and stuff like that, and you're having, you know, sexual dysfunction, which look at all the men on Viagra and everything these days.
[01:41:03.952 --> 01:41:05.333]  And again, I just want to say, folks,
[01:41:06.334 --> 01:41:08.336]  Well, just get the Mel Vitality.
[01:41:08.756 --> 01:41:09.697]  It's gonna sell itself.
[01:41:09.757 --> 01:41:10.658]  Wait till people try this.
[01:41:10.838 --> 01:41:12.880]  Put it this way, it makes you feel like you're 16 or 17 again.
[01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:15.282]  And it gives you that energy boost.
[01:41:15.302 --> 01:41:17.404]  No, I'm just saying I take a lot less of it.
[01:41:18.665 --> 01:41:24.510]  You were telling me, but also, we're gonna come up with a female version, but quite frankly, you were saying women that does the same thing for women.
[01:41:25.225 --> 01:41:29.387]  I've had women call my office and basically say, what are you giving to my husband?
[01:41:29.627 --> 01:41:30.908]  And do you have some for me?
[01:41:31.028 --> 01:41:34.790]  Because it's completely changed their relationship.
[01:41:34.910 --> 01:41:37.411]  I mean, they're able to have sexual relations again.
[01:41:37.491 --> 01:41:38.832]  They're balanced out.
[01:41:38.892 --> 01:41:42.234]  I mean, the guy is confident about himself because he's gaining muscle.
[01:41:42.274 --> 01:41:43.594]  He's losing that extra fat.
[01:41:43.914 --> 01:41:45.015]  He feels young again.
[01:41:45.295 --> 01:41:46.716]  It's all about with health.
[01:41:47.376 --> 01:41:50.799]  Health really is giving you self-confidence.
[01:41:50.839 --> 01:41:55.643]  I mean, when you look in the mirror and you look good and you look healthy, then you're self-confident when you go out into the world.
[01:41:55.703 --> 01:42:02.808]  When you look in the mirror and you don't look good and you feel bad and you're hungover or anything like that, you don't have that self-confidence for that day.
[01:42:02.909 --> 01:42:06.892]  You don't have that drive and that passion to go out into the world and accomplish what you want to accomplish.
[01:42:08.231 --> 01:42:08.371]  I don't
[01:42:26.716 --> 01:42:35.683]  We did this with Natural News Editor, naturalnews.com, Mike Adams, where he brought in the leading, a few years ago, we should do this again, leading baby formulas.
[01:42:35.964 --> 01:42:38.806]  They were like 75% sugar and high fructose corn syrup.
[01:42:39.366 --> 01:42:40.187]  I mean, no wonder!
[01:42:40.207 --> 01:42:43.590]  I mean, I've seen the studies where kids that drink formula have smaller brains.
[01:42:44.310 --> 01:42:45.451]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:42:45.531 --> 01:42:48.494]  I mean, you're meant to be getting fat right from your mama.
[01:42:49.577 --> 01:42:56.865]  I mean, you know, and the tests that have come back when they tested breast milk have shown very, very, very low fluoride levels in there.
[01:42:57.005 --> 01:43:06.536]  But when you put water and you bathe the children in fluoridated water and you're around it all the time, then you're going to have all those endocrine disorders.
[01:43:06.576 --> 01:43:10.981]  And you were telling me what fluoride does to other things, like how it supercharges the uptake of aluminum.
[01:43:11.121 --> 01:43:28.468]  Yeah, it supercharges the uptake of aluminum, it causes damage to the liver, causes damage to the brain, causes damage to the kidneys, it reduces IQ like we talked about, it gives you that brain fog, it reduces, it can cause skin rashes, you know, people that have skin rashes or can be fluoride sensitive.
[01:43:28.788 --> 01:43:34.430]  The list goes on and on and on and on, but it's just the fact that it chronically suppresses the immune system too.
[01:43:35.030 --> 01:43:39.673]  And that way you can activate your own body self-healing mechanism, which we've talked about a bunch of times.
[01:43:39.713 --> 01:43:45.856]  It's all about reducing your chemical exposure and cleansing your system on a regular basis.
[01:43:45.976 --> 01:43:48.278]  Cleaning the air, cleaning the water, you know.
[01:43:48.478 --> 01:43:56.462]  But the thing is, even though people have water filtration systems, and restaurants sometimes have water filtration systems, it's not going to get the fluoride out.
[01:43:56.542 --> 01:43:58.163]  I mean, they're just carbon-based systems.
[01:43:58.183 --> 01:43:59.484]  You have to have specialized
[01:44:00.064 --> 01:44:06.549]  Either distillation systems, which is why we use, in the production of our products, triple distilled water.
[01:44:06.850 --> 01:44:08.110]  It doesn't get any cleaner than that.
[01:44:08.131 --> 01:44:14.596]  And then we mix that in a certain percentage with glycerin, and then we use that as an extraction medium for the herbs or whatever we're extracting.
[01:44:15.056 --> 01:44:24.103]  What is happening, because when we sold out of it, I looked into carrying other so-called nascent iodine, and we just couldn't sell it because it tasted so bad, and also
[01:44:26.892 --> 01:44:28.373]  Well, I mean, why?
[01:44:29.573 --> 01:44:31.594]  It tastes and looks like it's oxidizing.
[01:44:31.654 --> 01:44:38.016]  What's happening with iodine that's put in with alcohol that makes it black instead of shiny, pretty blue on paper?
[01:44:39.297 --> 01:44:45.539]  You know, we've tested multiple different types of iodine by different manufacturers and we're getting different results across the board.
[01:44:46.860 --> 01:44:48.481]  First of all, it's in ethyl alcohol.
[01:44:48.661 --> 01:44:54.065]  In ethyl alcohol, it might be genetically modified, it might not, but alcohol is definitely a toxin to the body.
[01:44:54.886 --> 01:44:58.228]  That's the number one reason why I don't like alcohol extractions.
[01:44:58.308 --> 01:45:05.013]  Number two is, you're not able to extract or bond the substances into the matrix like you are with glycerin.
[01:45:05.953 --> 01:45:07.474]  Vegetable glycerin is what I'm talking about.
[01:45:07.495 --> 01:45:09.156]  We would never use animal products, but...
[01:45:09.836 --> 01:45:15.999]  With the glycerin, you can actually hold the iodine in the matrix, and then when you release it, it should turn a purplish color.
[01:45:16.039 --> 01:45:22.483]  That means that you're releasing free iodine onto whatever you want to release it onto.
[01:45:23.023 --> 01:45:26.785]  So basically, with the alcohol-based tinctures, number one, they taste really, really bad.
[01:45:27.125 --> 01:45:29.486]  We don't know what the microgram dose is in some of them.
[01:45:29.806 --> 01:45:33.148]  They're all different, and they're really hard to give to children or even pets.
[01:45:33.208 --> 01:45:35.189]  Look, I mean, you have dogs and cats right now.
[01:45:35.229 --> 01:45:36.930]  Practically every dog and cat
[01:45:37.330 --> 01:45:39.332]  But I just want to be clear.
[01:46:01.391 --> 01:46:03.212]  This is such a giant country, giant world.
[01:46:03.232 --> 01:46:07.394]  We're not in competition with folks other thyroid, you know, type deals and iodine.
[01:46:07.434 --> 01:46:08.014]  I think it's great.
[01:46:08.034 --> 01:46:10.776]  Get it from, you know, the quality gourmet salts that have it.
[01:46:11.016 --> 01:46:12.757]  Get it from other nascent iodines, whatever.
[01:46:15.058 --> 01:46:18.240]  My point is we're explaining why this system is glycerin based.
[01:46:19.306 --> 01:46:20.867]  Right, and I'm a big supporter.
[01:46:20.908 --> 01:46:24.230]  I mean it doesn't really, you know, it's just like if you want to drive a car.
[01:46:24.270 --> 01:46:28.094]  Do you want to drive a Bentley or do you want to drive like a little Volkswagen or something like that?
[01:46:28.354 --> 01:46:40.605]  You know, it's a matter of looking at... But if people can't afford, it's double the strength that half the prize-leading competitors are, our survival shield, or our fluoride shield, it's in a big two-ounce bottle by the way,
[01:46:42.932 --> 01:46:47.614]  They can still get the gourmet salts, correct, that have some of the good iodine in them?
[01:46:48.354 --> 01:46:55.797]  You can get like Himalayan crystal salt, which actually has natural iodine in it, and it's not processed, it's not bleached, all stuff like that.
[01:46:55.837 --> 01:47:00.299]  You can eat seaweed, organic seaweed, of course, make sure it's not coming from over there by Fukushima.
[01:47:00.519 --> 01:47:00.739]  Sure.
[01:47:00.859 --> 01:47:09.323]  But, you know, there's different processing techniques, too, that we even actually test the raw iodine when it comes in with Geiger counters just to make sure that it's not, you know,
[01:47:09.923 --> 01:47:10.343]  We're good to go!
[01:47:32.672 --> 01:47:36.273]  And it's a passion of mine, just like yours, to bring this information out to the public.
[01:47:36.333 --> 01:47:39.414]  So I want to produce the best product out there.
[01:47:39.435 --> 01:47:43.356]  And one of the reasons why I started that is because I looked and I couldn't find any good products out there.
[01:47:43.376 --> 01:47:46.357]  They all have magnesium stearate in them.
[01:47:46.397 --> 01:47:54.760]  If you track it down, they're using herbs that are two or three or four years old that sat in a warehouse at 200 degrees or 150 degrees somewhere or in a shipping container.
[01:47:55.280 --> 01:48:05.886]  I mean, when you really start tracking back, taking a product off the shelf at any drugstore or major retailer, and if you call that company, first of all, they're probably not even going to give you any information on it.
[01:48:06.567 --> 01:48:13.351]  And if you really track it back... Listen, some of the biggest companies, we were looking at private label stuff, the bottle costs more than what's in it.
[01:48:14.051 --> 01:48:15.792]  And I was like, no, we're not going to buy this.
[01:48:15.892 --> 01:48:17.493]  I mean, what is going on out there?
[01:48:17.953 --> 01:48:20.295]  Well, because everybody wants to produce a cheap product.
[01:48:20.315 --> 01:48:22.096]  They don't really care about the end consumer.
[01:48:22.196 --> 01:48:23.817]  I mean, and that's the good thing about you.
[01:48:23.857 --> 01:48:26.458]  That's a good thing about me is we actually care about the end consumer.
[01:48:26.598 --> 01:48:31.181]  Well, I mean, I don't want the bad luck from selling people stuff that isn't highest quality.
[01:48:31.261 --> 01:48:33.002]  I mean, that's like God fearing.
[01:48:33.582 --> 01:48:35.143]  I don't want to get into pitching the thing.
[01:48:35.163 --> 01:48:36.003]  I think I'm not even trying to.
[01:48:36.023 --> 01:48:39.484]  We just, whenever we're talking, we always talk about this so it's kind of inside baseball stuff.
[01:48:39.964 --> 01:48:45.946]  What do you make of the federal government lobbying states and states passing laws saying cities can't take fluoride out?
[01:48:46.266 --> 01:48:48.247]  I mean, for me, that is so outrageous.
[01:48:48.787 --> 01:48:57.150]  Why do you think the establishment, Dr. Group, wants to put hydrofluorosilic acid and other fluorines and the bromine and all the stuff they're putting in the bread?
[01:48:57.190 --> 01:48:59.671]  I mean, they've got to know what they're doing.
[01:49:00.231 --> 01:49:01.452]  Of course they know what they're doing.
[01:49:01.492 --> 01:49:04.975]  I mean, this whole part of the population control scheme is about keeping people dumbed down.
[01:49:04.995 --> 01:49:06.216]  It's about keeping people sick.
[01:49:06.296 --> 01:49:15.044]  I mean, and that's why... So we can't be mad at Americans and others in the West that are so unhealthy, highest cancer rates, dying, all of that, and being zombies.
[01:49:15.084 --> 01:49:15.925]  We've been poisoned.
[01:49:16.525 --> 01:49:17.625]  We are being poisoned.
[01:49:17.665 --> 01:49:19.946]  I mean, that is a super toxic chemical.
[01:49:19.986 --> 01:49:29.509]  I mean, the phosphate industry, for fertilizer, which is a whole other big scam, but they use the phosphate-containing rocks, they pour sulfuric acid on it, they get these chemicals.
[01:49:30.990 --> 01:49:37.812]  It would cost them way more money to dispose of this because hydrofluorosilic acid is so toxic.
[01:49:38.512 --> 01:49:40.073]  It's almost as toxic as arsenic.
[01:49:40.293 --> 01:49:47.296]  With the amount that they're producing for the fertilizer industry, and I'm not even talking about the aluminum production industry, what are they going to do with all that stuff?
[01:49:47.336 --> 01:49:49.837]  And this goes back, actually, into the early 1900s.
[01:49:49.917 --> 01:49:55.520]  So, they're dumping it in the water supply because they know that it's going to kill everybody off eventually.
[01:49:55.780 --> 01:49:57.160]  It's a slow poison.
[01:49:57.220 --> 01:49:58.181]  It's a slow death.
[01:49:58.201 --> 01:50:03.123]  And again, for those that don't know, from aluminum smelting, they have it as a byproduct fertilizer, but the big one at the end of World War II,
[01:50:03.743 --> 01:50:05.965]  And they had big spills in Tennessee that were killing the whole river.
[01:50:05.985 --> 01:50:08.107]  It was the uranium enrichment.
[01:50:08.167 --> 01:50:09.848]  They mined it out of the same limestone.
[01:50:10.208 --> 01:50:12.690]  They had all this hydrofluorosilic acid left.
[01:50:13.031 --> 01:50:15.573]  And they went, what do we do for the Manhattan Project?
[01:50:16.013 --> 01:50:17.354]  We put it in the water!
[01:50:18.115 --> 01:50:18.635]  Oh man!
[01:50:18.655 --> 01:50:27.302]  Yeah, and what happened was the citizens have actually, especially like in San Diego and in some areas throughout the United States, they've had action networks and they fought.
[01:50:28.263 --> 01:50:55.582]  Dating back to the early 1900s and have laws in the cities that they cannot fluoridate the water, but now what's happening is Big Brothers coming down and saying to the states you have to you know enforce this fluoridation and the states are actually Overturning or cutting the funding to these small cities that have not had fluoridated water for hundreds of years exactly making and forcing them to fluoridate the water now well I was about to say I just happened to be at a hotel and we're having a water convention and
[01:50:56.022 --> 01:51:08.870]  In Arkansas, where they passed a law the year before to make you have fluoride, and I'm, no exaggeration, I forget, it was like 30, 40, I forget, I mean, had, had water guys come over and go, we're big listeners, and we don't put it in the water even though they make us buy it and we got it.
[01:51:09.150 --> 01:51:10.291]  It gets gotten rid of.
[01:51:10.711 --> 01:51:13.833]  It's not only... And they were, they were all in a conspiracy of liberty.
[01:51:16.106 --> 01:51:17.928]  For their families, they were just not doing it.
[01:51:18.288 --> 01:51:19.669]  See, that's how we're gonna save people.
[01:51:19.709 --> 01:51:20.309]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:51:20.549 --> 01:51:27.193]  Well, what I'm saying is it's not just the fluorosilicic acid that they're getting from China now, shipping over, but it's all the arsenic and lead.
[01:51:27.233 --> 01:51:28.214]  Stay there, explain that.
[01:51:28.274 --> 01:51:29.055]  Exactly, stay there.
[01:51:31.010 --> 01:51:38.652]  That's the sound of a .44 Magnum and TraumaMaxx, a high-tech hybrid Kevlar bulletproof vest from InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[01:51:38.752 --> 01:51:41.053]  We'll stop it and most pistol rounds.
[01:51:41.233 --> 01:51:47.855]  TraumaMaxx is a major breakthrough in pistol-rated body armor, and prices start at just $170 per insert.
[01:51:48.075 --> 01:51:53.116]  More protection, more stopping power, more mobility, and it weighs less than 5 pounds.

[01:52:29.266 --> 01:52:30.127]  The facts are in.
[01:52:30.287 --> 01:52:31.408]  The studies are legion.
[01:52:31.688 --> 01:52:39.075]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[01:52:39.215 --> 01:52:42.678]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[01:52:43.038 --> 01:52:43.459]  Simple.
[01:52:43.619 --> 01:52:48.063]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[01:52:48.343 --> 01:52:53.768]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[01:52:54.048 --> 01:52:59.432]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield Formulation.

[01:53:29.515 --> 01:53:30.796]  There's a reason why the U.S.
[01:53:30.836 --> 01:53:34.559]  government is conducting emergency drills simulating the collapse of the U.S.
[01:53:34.599 --> 01:53:35.480]  electrical grid.
[01:53:35.500 --> 01:53:37.201]  Northeast Corridor, offline.
[01:53:37.241 --> 01:53:38.322]  They're getting prepared.
[01:53:38.843 --> 01:53:40.584]  Will you be prepared when it shuts down?
[01:53:41.345 --> 01:53:42.966]  A massive power outage.
[01:53:43.186 --> 01:53:44.507]  The Cyber Pearl Harbor.
[01:53:44.567 --> 01:53:47.229]  The evacuation procedures are working.
[01:53:47.910 --> 01:53:51.472]  The Grid Eraser and Grid Eraser Maximus portable solar generators.

[01:54:34.096 --> 01:54:34.976]  Don't worry.
[01:54:35.056 --> 01:54:36.937]  This show is documented.
[01:54:37.137 --> 01:54:40.018]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:54:40.379 --> 01:54:44.020]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[01:54:44.360 --> 01:54:47.902]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[01:54:47.942 --> 01:54:50.523]  I'm not going to talk about the products anymore that we just launched.
[01:54:50.563 --> 01:54:52.763]  Super Metal Vitality and the Fluoride Shield.
[01:54:53.184 --> 01:54:55.264]  And of course it pulls out a bunch of other toxins as well.
[01:54:55.304 --> 01:54:58.466]  But I was asking you during the break and you said, you know, you'll talk about it.
[01:54:59.326 --> 01:55:03.989]  Your super male vitality that you developed for us, you were explaining, it gets your body to release the testosterone.
[01:55:04.029 --> 01:55:04.610]  How does it do that?
[01:55:05.070 --> 01:55:14.577]  Well, what I like to do is formulate stuff that's going to actually help the body heal itself, instead of having somebody that just needs to be on something forever.
[01:55:14.617 --> 01:55:26.625]  So what that's designed to do, since automatically the male body quits producing hormones, at least testosterone and DHEA and some of the male hormones, right around 30 to 40, but we're seeing that even younger now because of the estrogen dominance,
[01:55:27.265 --> 01:55:40.877]  What I wanted to do is actually instead of like what's going on right now where guys are going to the doctor and they're getting these testosterone shots and all this you know testosterone creams and it's altering their hormone levels because they're shooting it into their bloodstream.
[01:55:41.678 --> 01:55:46.742]  What I wanted to do is put stuff together where it was going to naturally balance out your hormone levels.
[01:55:46.782 --> 01:55:49.905]  So the mixture of herbs and constituents that I came up with
[01:55:50.465 --> 01:56:01.549]  Actually increases your testosterone levels by let's say 20-25% because your body produces more testosterone and it regulates the production of estrogen.
[01:56:01.569 --> 01:56:06.790]  Again, I just want to be honest, I take like a third of what the recommended dose is.
[01:56:06.870 --> 01:56:07.871]  Also growth hormone too.
[01:56:07.931 --> 01:56:14.413]  Growth hormone is a major factor and the formula was designed to balance out your growth hormone levels as well.
[01:56:15.489 --> 01:56:15.989]  It's amazing.
[01:56:16.289 --> 01:56:21.851]  Getting back into fluoride, what are they going to do with Harvard studies saying get it out of the water, cancer, IQ reductions?
[01:56:21.911 --> 01:56:22.732]  What are they going to do?
[01:56:22.752 --> 01:56:23.732]  We can put those on screen.
[01:56:23.952 --> 01:56:26.573]  Just Google Harvard study IQ.
[01:56:27.533 --> 01:56:34.236]  How can they keep it in the water when it's totally on record and all their own EPA scientists are saying get it out and FDA?
[01:56:34.896 --> 01:56:37.257]  If you take a pea-sized amount of toothpaste,
[01:56:37.837 --> 01:56:42.039]  You're supposed, if you swallow a pea-sized amount of toothpaste, you're supposed to call poison control.
[01:56:42.099 --> 01:56:43.240]  That's how dangerous it is.
[01:56:43.300 --> 01:56:51.104]  The good news is, we are getting more support by, you know, just by the general citizens, by getting the information.
[01:56:51.124 --> 01:56:56.167]  The government, at the scientist level, says take it out, but the politicians won't.
[01:56:56.667 --> 01:56:58.829]  Well, that's just because that's how the system works.
[01:56:58.889 --> 01:57:03.694]  I mean, they're not going to take it out because they know they don't want a bunch of healthy people around.
[01:57:03.754 --> 01:57:13.444]  I mean, you know, hopefully, you know, there is more science leading to the damaging effects of fluoride every single day, which is a good thing.
[01:57:13.824 --> 01:57:17.548]  And hopefully in our lifetime, hopefully in the next few years, we can completely get it out.
[01:57:17.568 --> 01:57:20.451]  I mean, look at all the other countries that don't even fluoridate their water.
[01:57:20.891 --> 01:57:21.692]  Or pulling it.
[01:57:22.032 --> 01:57:23.553]  Germany, England, they're pulling it.
[01:57:23.973 --> 01:57:31.457]  And China, which is a big manufacturer of arms and everything, is shipping us all that fluoride, that toxic fluoride, to put in our water systems.
[01:57:31.517 --> 01:57:33.218]  And they put iodine in the water.
[01:57:33.698 --> 01:57:44.904]  Heavily contaminated with, I've seen pictures of people at the water plants, the technicians that add it to the buckets, and this thick on the bottom of the bucket, they don't even know what it is.
[01:57:44.984 --> 01:57:47.606]  Oh yeah, no, there's local newscasts of all places.
[01:57:47.646 --> 01:57:49.067]  Oklahoma did one, another, I've aired them.
[01:57:49.787 --> 01:57:51.188]  Where they went and tested.
[01:57:51.208 --> 01:57:53.028]  It says fluoride from China.
[01:57:53.709 --> 01:57:55.649]  And half of it's not even fluoride.
[01:57:55.669 --> 01:57:58.150]  It's a mixture of every poison they've got in China.
[01:57:58.450 --> 01:58:00.631]  They ship here for the idiot American's water.
[01:58:00.751 --> 01:58:04.753]  That's because China gets rid of all their toxic waste by shipping it over here.
[01:58:04.813 --> 01:58:07.294]  All the lead and the arsenic and the cadmium.
[01:58:07.314 --> 01:58:09.015]  And the melamine for the babies.
[01:58:09.035 --> 01:58:09.415]  Everything.
[01:58:09.435 --> 01:58:10.775]  They just ship it over here.
[01:58:10.895 --> 01:58:15.457]  I saw a statistic that 90 plus percent of pharmaceuticals are made in China.
[01:58:15.877 --> 01:58:17.478]  Including a lot of the vitamins.
[01:58:18.530 --> 01:58:18.990]  That's right.
[01:58:19.330 --> 01:58:19.651]  That's right.
[01:58:19.671 --> 01:58:22.052]  And there's a lot of counterfeiting going on over in China too.
[01:58:22.472 --> 01:58:31.757]  There's counterfeiters out there right now that are taking popular products, they're getting them manufactured in China, they're putting the exact label on them, and they're selling them on Amazon and selling them through eBay.
[01:58:31.777 --> 01:58:48.066]  So if you're looking for a good quality product out there, make sure you go to the source or make sure you go to someone reputable because these counterfeiters are out there and they're taking over and they're focusing on the nutrition industry because the nutrition and supplement industry is growing at a rapid rate because people don't want to have to rely on their
[01:58:48.266 --> 01:58:51.328]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:59:19.699 --> 01:59:20.560]  The facts are in.
[01:59:20.720 --> 01:59:21.841]  The studies are legion.
[01:59:22.121 --> 01:59:29.507]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[01:59:29.647 --> 01:59:33.109]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[01:59:33.470 --> 01:59:33.870]  Simple.
[01:59:34.050 --> 01:59:38.454]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[01:59:38.774 --> 01:59:44.198]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[01:59:44.458 --> 01:59:49.841]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield formulation.
[01:59:50.001 --> 02:00:00.507]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[02:00:00.807 --> 02:00:02.648]  Let's take a stand against the globalists.
[02:00:02.768 --> 02:00:05.069]  by blocking their poisons with fluoride shield.
[02:00:05.369 --> 02:00:07.210]  I use fluoride shield every day.

[02:00:13.074 --> 02:00:17.336]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the Info War at the same time.
[02:00:17.476 --> 02:00:19.377]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:00:22.679 --> 02:00:24.660]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:25.080 --> 02:00:27.882]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:32.475 --> 02:00:36.659]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:37.300 --> 02:00:38.101]  You want answers?
[02:00:38.861 --> 02:00:39.742]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:40.423 --> 02:00:44.027]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:44.607 --> 02:00:48.711]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:01:01.776 --> 02:01:08.060]  We've got NSA whistleblower, Parek Salant, formerly in NSA security.
[02:01:08.080 --> 02:01:20.227]  And I don't mean security guards out front, I mean actually over NSA security areas, who is one of the main people, the top two or three, up there with Snowden.
[02:01:20.827 --> 02:01:25.210]  It's just that when he blew the whistle, they weren't arresting people back then for exposing criminal spying.
[02:01:26.178 --> 02:01:30.481]  He's the one, of course, months ago that explained to all the European spies exactly what was happening.
[02:01:30.961 --> 02:01:35.924]  It broke in the London Guardian, and then they retracted the story under British government threats.
[02:01:36.425 --> 02:01:37.525]  But it was still too late.
[02:01:37.946 --> 02:01:39.927]  Now the British government's out threatening again.
[02:01:41.067 --> 02:01:42.448]  So, Wayne Madsen's coming up.
[02:01:42.889 --> 02:01:45.150]  Right now, let's go to Terry in Washington.
[02:01:45.190 --> 02:01:46.551]  Terry, thanks for holding them.
[02:01:46.591 --> 02:01:49.153]  We'll go to JD, Juan, Don, and...
[02:01:50.811 --> 02:01:55.853]  I didn't say that on purpose, but that actually says Don Juan on the screen with the two names next to each other.
[02:01:56.533 --> 02:01:58.693]  Let's go to Terry in Washington.
[02:01:58.733 --> 02:01:59.154]  Go ahead.
[02:01:59.174 --> 02:02:00.934]  Hey, fellas.
[02:02:01.434 --> 02:02:02.095]  Good to see you.
[02:02:02.115 --> 02:02:02.375]  Hey, buddy.
[02:02:03.235 --> 02:02:07.376]  Hey, I'm sitting here in Washington waiting to get radiated.
[02:02:08.477 --> 02:02:12.978]  I can't believe how Obama-Lynn Biden has screwed this country up so bad.
[02:02:14.899 --> 02:02:16.519]  Obama-Bin Lydon.
[02:02:16.559 --> 02:02:17.780]  That's a good name for him, yeah.
[02:02:17.980 --> 02:02:18.980]  Obama-Lynn Biden.
[02:02:19.608 --> 02:02:20.569]  Obama-Lynn Biden.
[02:02:21.149 --> 02:02:21.710]  Yeah, there you go.
[02:02:21.990 --> 02:02:24.291]  Don't forget the succulent, luscious Hillary.
[02:02:24.311 --> 02:02:26.213]  Oh, God.
[02:02:26.593 --> 02:02:27.634]  That's... Oh, man.
[02:02:28.615 --> 02:02:30.476]  I tell you, if she gets in, we're really screwed.
[02:02:31.717 --> 02:02:33.518]  Do you think her girlfriends really like her?
[02:02:33.538 --> 02:02:38.522]  Or just... It's like asking, do the playmates really like Hugh Hefner, or is it for his money?
[02:02:39.409 --> 02:02:43.931]  I wonder if all the women like with her and Janet Reno and all of them.
[02:02:44.731 --> 02:02:48.493]  Janet Reno came out in the Miami Papers, got caught with a 12-year-old in the back of a car.
[02:02:48.993 --> 02:02:58.937]  Janet Reno, years ago, it was like 15 years ago, was on so many drugs that she was pulled over, had vomited all over the child that was a CPS child.
[02:02:59.418 --> 02:03:00.738]  I'm sorry, go ahead, what were you saying?
[02:03:01.358 --> 02:03:02.299]  That's a true story, by the way.
[02:03:02.319 --> 02:03:04.640]  No, that's fine.
[02:03:08.454 --> 02:03:13.556]  Uh, now we know the real story behind, you know, what happened in the last couple years.
[02:03:14.716 --> 02:03:28.961]  But I challenge Obama to tell me why he didn't stop the shooting at the theater, Sandy Hook, Fort Hood, uh, the Boston Marathon bombing.
[02:03:30.101 --> 02:03:32.502]  So that tells you right there, the NSA does not work.
[02:03:34.482 --> 02:03:36.003]  And it's not there for that reason.
[02:03:39.898 --> 02:03:43.040]  Well, number one, questioning our leader is racist.
[02:03:43.580 --> 02:03:45.602]  Do you understand you may have to be sent for re-education?
[02:03:46.582 --> 02:03:48.984]  Plus, you don't criticize our dear leader.
[02:03:49.024 --> 02:03:49.744]  I appreciate your call.
[02:03:50.245 --> 02:03:51.826]  I apologize for that racism, folks.
[02:03:52.506 --> 02:03:54.387]  Let's talk to JD in California.
[02:03:54.447 --> 02:03:55.108]  Welcome, sir.
[02:03:55.128 --> 02:03:57.589]  Hello?
[02:03:58.030 --> 02:03:58.310]  Yes, sir.
[02:03:59.851 --> 02:04:06.435]  Yeah, I was just going through your InfoWars website there and I saw that healthcare.gov story.
[02:04:07.162 --> 02:04:13.987]  And I noticed, I wonder if it's one of their elite sick joke or something, but it looks like somebody's hanging themselves to death.
[02:04:14.087 --> 02:04:17.129]  All you see is a pair of legs and a kicked out stool underneath them.
[02:04:19.151 --> 02:04:21.632]  What are you talking about specifically at healthcare.gov?
[02:04:23.093 --> 02:04:25.135]  Just the cover page of the website.
[02:04:25.973 --> 02:04:26.213]  Wow.
[02:04:26.773 --> 02:04:31.495]  Well, you know, I mean, they did have the number 1-800-FU on purpose.
[02:04:31.535 --> 02:04:38.077]  That was... Because you have to understand, with con artists, throwing it in your face is the most luscious part.
[02:04:39.478 --> 02:04:41.878]  How much do you think his followers will take?
[02:04:43.919 --> 02:04:50.821]  Oh, well, like you joke about all the time, even though it's not a joke, I really think that they would walk right off the cliff or put their head in the guillotine hole.
[02:04:50.841 --> 02:04:55.163]  You know, as long as they're proud of something free, they're just that gullible.
[02:04:56.149 --> 02:04:58.250]  You know, willing to believe that something's going to come free.
[02:04:59.071 --> 02:05:00.372]  Well, yeah, I mean, that ought to be a plan.
[02:05:00.392 --> 02:05:04.595]  Just say, look, stick your head in a guillotine and you're going to not be racist.
[02:05:04.715 --> 02:05:08.177]  And the average person would actually kill people.
[02:05:08.878 --> 02:05:09.318]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:05:09.358 --> 02:05:11.580]  The health care insurance market is open.
[02:05:11.600 --> 02:05:11.900]  There it is.
[02:05:11.920 --> 02:05:14.021]  I think that's one of the towels we put together or somebody else did.
[02:05:14.461 --> 02:05:15.642]  That's not officially on the site.
[02:05:15.922 --> 02:05:19.565]  But don't give them any ideas because they did put on the cover of Newsweek the case for killing Granny.
[02:05:19.985 --> 02:05:21.506]  They showed a plug being pulled out of the wall.
[02:05:22.627 --> 02:05:24.728]  Dumb little yuppies think they're going to get some extra goodies.
[02:05:24.748 --> 02:05:25.329]  We'll be right back.
[02:05:29.747 --> 02:05:35.331]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[02:05:35.551 --> 02:05:42.776]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[02:05:42.936 --> 02:05:46.078]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[02:05:46.278 --> 02:05:48.059]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[02:05:48.299 --> 02:05:52.880]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[02:05:52.960 --> 02:05:55.721]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[02:05:55.882 --> 02:06:01.664]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[02:06:01.824 --> 02:06:05.305]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[02:06:05.505 --> 02:06:10.567]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine.

[02:06:38.978 --> 02:06:47.200]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:06:47.381 --> 02:06:52.022]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[02:07:35.396 --> 02:07:39.761]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.

[02:08:44.197 --> 02:08:45.398]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:45.498 --> 02:08:51.803]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[02:08:51.843 --> 02:08:54.325]  Yeah, and Uncle Sam's got brain worms.
[02:08:54.365 --> 02:08:55.726]  He's been taken over by the Globalist.
[02:08:57.567 --> 02:09:02.211]  Uncle Sam's always had a lot of problems when Uncle Sam is absolutely alien.
[02:09:03.772 --> 02:09:10.957]  Publicly declaring our founders enemies, and us enemies, and our returning veterans enemies.
[02:09:11.878 --> 02:09:13.099]  I think that's pretty clear, isn't it?
[02:09:17.111 --> 02:09:21.334]  And I think... I like how the guitar, like, agreed with me right there.
[02:09:21.354 --> 02:09:21.894]  It's like, yes.
[02:09:24.055 --> 02:09:24.276]  Yes.
[02:09:26.057 --> 02:09:27.318]  Didn't the guitar sing like, yes?
[02:09:31.300 --> 02:09:32.701]  We're back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:09:32.741 --> 02:09:36.043]  We're here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:09:36.083 --> 02:09:37.204]  to 2 p.m.
[02:09:37.264 --> 02:09:38.545]  Central Standard Time.
[02:09:38.565 --> 02:09:43.007]  And then, of course, we have 7 o'clock Central.
[02:09:44.238 --> 02:09:47.140]  Standard time, we have the Infowars nightly news.
[02:09:47.160 --> 02:09:49.322]  We're gonna go right back to your phone calls now.
[02:09:49.702 --> 02:09:51.924]  I just wanted to mention some of the news coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[02:09:51.944 --> 02:09:54.525]  I'm gonna do a big news blitz of a bunch of stuff I haven't got to yet.
[02:09:54.565 --> 02:09:57.147]  This is just now breaking up at DrudgeReport.com.
[02:09:57.688 --> 02:09:58.928]  It's from Breitbart.com.
[02:09:59.469 --> 02:10:01.070]  Germany, U.S.
[02:10:01.350 --> 02:10:04.252]  may have targeted Merkel's cell phone, AP.
[02:10:06.714 --> 02:10:09.336]  Oh, that's like saying fish may swim in the ocean.
[02:10:12.210 --> 02:10:17.839]  It's kind of like, oh, we know there's back doors in all your software because we ordered all the software makers to make them.
[02:10:18.740 --> 02:10:21.024]  And now we're worried the Chinese government may be using them.
[02:10:21.585 --> 02:10:22.566]  Jeeper creeper!
[02:10:24.045 --> 02:10:29.489]  We blew a big hole in the side of your house and we want to tell you bugs might come in or the weather, oh.
[02:10:30.209 --> 02:10:32.431]  I mean, it's just all of this has been public forever.
[02:10:32.671 --> 02:10:34.432]  The truth is they can't hide any of this.
[02:10:34.853 --> 02:10:36.034]  They don't hide any of it.
[02:10:36.454 --> 02:10:43.259]  It's public that the big defense contractors, you know, will run giant child kidnapping rings worldwide, including the U.S.
[02:10:43.619 --> 02:10:45.320]  Fox News always asking, where's this kid?
[02:10:45.901 --> 02:10:48.803]  They were raped and murdered 20 years ago in Saudi Arabia.
[02:10:48.823 --> 02:10:51.885]  Those guys pay a lot to murder your child.
[02:10:51.905 --> 02:10:53.186]  What do you think they're doing in there right now?
[02:10:54.130 --> 02:10:55.634]  I mean, it's not like it's some secret.
[02:10:57.678 --> 02:11:01.707]  Your daughter might still be alive in Thailand right now in a dungeon 20 years later.
[02:11:03.328 --> 02:11:07.632]  We've got a bunch of murderers running the country, a bunch of mafia, people that make mafia look like good guys.
[02:11:08.112 --> 02:11:14.958]  Everybody's so naive, or the cops, I know we're all afraid, and yeah, you're right about it, better watch it.
[02:11:15.458 --> 02:11:17.780]  I'm not going along, what do you think I intend to do here?
[02:11:17.800 --> 02:11:21.043]  I fully plan on them killing me.
[02:11:21.483 --> 02:11:27.128]  I don't look forward to it, don't like it, but I'm like full steam ahead, ramming speed, that's the only spirit you can have.
[02:11:27.909 --> 02:11:30.531]  I cannot help but resist these people.
[02:11:32.125 --> 02:11:33.646]  Who's going to stand up for all these kids?
[02:11:33.846 --> 02:11:35.307]  Who's going to stand up for all these women?
[02:11:35.947 --> 02:11:37.488]  You want to be a gangster culture?
[02:11:37.508 --> 02:11:38.228]  You think that's cool?
[02:11:38.468 --> 02:11:39.549]  Well, you now live in one.
[02:11:39.709 --> 02:11:40.409]  You're the slave.
[02:11:41.250 --> 02:11:42.390]  Stop acting like one.
[02:11:43.591 --> 02:11:45.232]  Laying down only encourages it.
[02:11:45.252 --> 02:11:45.632]  Look at this.
[02:11:46.012 --> 02:11:46.472]  Merkel.
[02:11:47.193 --> 02:11:49.434]  Bush used to have a toilet that followed him around.
[02:11:50.299 --> 02:11:59.128]  When he actually had a groom of the stool, George W. Bush, somebody that would tidy him up, make sure that none of the paper got left or anything, it was a chemical toilet, they were taking his hotels everywhere.
[02:11:59.488 --> 02:12:05.114]  Because they caught the French and others setting up stuff in the sewer lines to find out what George W. Bush is on.
[02:12:06.235 --> 02:12:10.580]  Of course, in fact, I would expect the NSA to be spying on Merkel.
[02:12:10.820 --> 02:12:13.262]  That's who you're supposed to spy on is foreign governments.
[02:12:14.025 --> 02:12:16.045]  You're not supposed to spy on the American people.
[02:12:16.725 --> 02:12:20.266]  And supposed to give all your Google searches to the perverts at the TSA.
[02:12:20.806 --> 02:12:22.106]  Everything's backwards here.
[02:12:22.847 --> 02:12:24.807]  You're supposed to spy on Herr Merkel.
[02:12:27.447 --> 02:12:30.188]  But the globalists are letting all this come out so they won't be spied on.
[02:12:30.208 --> 02:12:30.828]  See how that works?
[02:12:31.448 --> 02:12:32.148]  It's unbelievable.
[02:12:32.168 --> 02:12:33.268]  Let's go to phone calls here.
[02:12:34.569 --> 02:12:35.909]  And I do mean Herr Merkel.
[02:12:36.849 --> 02:12:38.769]  Looks like the cousin of Janet Reno.
[02:12:39.510 --> 02:12:41.550]  Maybe Merkel's the mother of
[02:12:43.496 --> 02:12:45.197]  Who's that young man on MSNBC?
[02:12:45.857 --> 02:12:46.297]  Maddow?
[02:12:47.077 --> 02:12:48.598]  Let's go to Jonathan in New York.
[02:12:49.158 --> 02:12:51.239]  I mean, I mean, that lady on there, excuse me.
[02:12:51.939 --> 02:12:52.539]  No, no, no.
[02:12:53.460 --> 02:12:54.840]  Used to have a show on Saturday Night Live.
[02:12:55.240 --> 02:12:59.682]  Now, it's got a show on MSNBC.
[02:12:59.722 --> 02:13:00.342]  I forget the name.
[02:13:00.362 --> 02:13:02.663]  What's the name of the... Pat?
[02:13:03.143 --> 02:13:03.484]  Pat!
[02:13:04.564 --> 02:13:06.205]  What's the name of Pat's show on MSNBC?
[02:13:06.225 --> 02:13:06.765]  What do they call it?
[02:13:07.125 --> 02:13:07.885]  The Pat Show?
[02:13:08.826 --> 02:13:09.506]  Or, oh no.
[02:13:11.872 --> 02:13:14.333]  I thought it was the Pat Show, it's not the Rachel Maddow Show.
[02:13:15.434 --> 02:13:16.014]  Okay, whatever.
[02:13:17.315 --> 02:13:20.336]  And look, there she is on screen giving birth to TSA, doesn't matter.
[02:13:20.796 --> 02:13:23.018]  She runs off, it runs off, you know, to suck our blood.
[02:13:23.038 --> 02:13:35.644]  If you're a radio listener, you have to actually watch us at infowars.com forward slash show or prisonpundit.tv and you can see the birth of, actual footage, the birth of Rachel Maddow.
[02:13:37.523 --> 02:13:45.596]  And Mommy running away to help all the people at the universities, help give all the people, the young ladies their admission.
[02:13:45.616 --> 02:13:49.362]  Alright, let's go ahead and talk to Jonathan.
[02:13:49.922 --> 02:13:51.245]  Jonathan, you got cut off by the break.
[02:13:51.265 --> 02:13:51.926]  You had another point.
[02:13:51.966 --> 02:13:52.446]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:13:53.470 --> 02:13:55.352]  Yeah, thanks for having me.
[02:13:55.392 --> 02:13:56.032]  I'll talk to you again.
[02:13:56.092 --> 02:13:57.994]  I live in FEMA Region No.
[02:13:58.014 --> 02:14:06.120]  2, New York State, and I think I remember you saying that within the month of November they're going to start doing, quote-unquote, the shutdowns of the power grid.
[02:14:06.680 --> 02:14:14.166]  So I think this is just perfect timing for them to be showing this American blackout video, you know, just before everything starts
[02:14:14.286 --> 02:14:21.230]  Well, no, I mean, they have actuaries with the power companies to get you ready to pay four or five times what you did and get power about three hours a night.
[02:14:21.711 --> 02:14:23.612]  Enough because they can control you.
[02:14:23.832 --> 02:14:26.854]  It'll come on when you get home and you're supposed to go to bed by eight.
[02:14:26.894 --> 02:14:28.235]  So you'll have it like five to eight.
[02:14:29.107 --> 02:14:29.627]  You understand?
[02:14:29.647 --> 02:14:30.788]  I mean, no, that's the plan.
[02:14:30.808 --> 02:14:32.629]  You're going to live in hell!
[02:14:33.349 --> 02:14:34.290]  That's the plan to Opolis.
[02:14:34.310 --> 02:14:36.771]  They teach the kids in Britain with these training videos.
[02:14:36.991 --> 02:14:38.192]  You'll get meat once a year.
[02:14:38.732 --> 02:14:41.694]  To go somewhere, you'll have to get authorization on your smartphone.
[02:14:41.894 --> 02:14:42.834]  This is all the plan.
[02:14:43.135 --> 02:14:44.335]  Ration cards to eat.
[02:14:44.695 --> 02:14:45.816]  I mean, hell world!
[02:14:45.916 --> 02:14:46.656]  Hell world!
[02:14:47.157 --> 02:14:51.119]  With globalists and jet copters above you with your kidnapped child with them.
[02:14:51.179 --> 02:14:52.960]  I mean, literally, just feeding on you.
[02:14:53.760 --> 02:14:54.281]  How's that sound?
[02:14:56.382 --> 02:14:58.263]  I have no comment with that one, then.
[02:14:58.933 --> 02:15:00.053]  Well, God bless you, I'm going to jump.
[02:15:00.293 --> 02:15:03.734]  No, in every culture you get an elite who likes to be psychopathic.
[02:15:04.155 --> 02:15:06.455]  So the Druid elite would say, I want your kids to sacrifice.
[02:15:07.015 --> 02:15:08.656]  The Aztecs said, I want your kids to sacrifice.
[02:15:08.676 --> 02:15:10.576]  The Babylonians said, I want your kids to sacrifice.
[02:15:10.836 --> 02:15:12.837]  The Romans said, I want your kids in the arena to sacrifice.
[02:15:13.117 --> 02:15:16.858]  When a Roman lord would die, they would have slaves fight to the death over it.
[02:15:16.878 --> 02:15:20.779]  The psychopaths got control of some of the Norman.
[02:15:21.179 --> 02:15:23.700]  They said, when the noble dies, we burn your wife.
[02:15:24.040 --> 02:15:24.820]  We don't want to listen to her.
[02:15:25.141 --> 02:15:25.941]  That's actually a good custom.
[02:15:25.961 --> 02:15:26.301]  I'm joking.
[02:15:26.641 --> 02:15:42.694]  I mean, all this stuff, every culture, they demand to murder you, and then you bow, and they cut your heart out, and then the priest class of the Aztecs, and the Mayans, and other Mayan cultures, it's all Mayan, the lower priest class made money off the daily sacrifices.
[02:15:43.434 --> 02:15:45.115]  And every city had to have it, you had to have meat.
[02:15:46.383 --> 02:15:57.187]  And the premium, if God wanted a child, because, you know, Chocmoole or Quitscatlipotle or Lingon Serpent, they wanted, you know, because God wanted the meat, because obviously the priest tasted it, that tasted better.
[02:15:57.207 --> 02:15:58.467]  Everybody knows veal's better.
[02:15:59.327 --> 02:16:01.128]  And longham veal's better.
[02:16:01.708 --> 02:16:09.851]  And so they would hang the bodies down at the bottom of the pyramid, and then you would go and pay your offering to the priest class to get a succulent slice.
[02:16:10.671 --> 02:16:12.212]  And I mean, what's wrong with that?
[02:16:12.732 --> 02:16:15.573]  And I'll guarantee you, if you were against that, you would have been called an extremist.
[02:16:16.314 --> 02:16:17.815]  And every culture ate children.
[02:16:17.835 --> 02:16:20.055]  I mean, don't just say it's the Aztecs.
[02:16:20.075 --> 02:16:32.360]  I mean, they just kind of created a science and they had good agriculture with their chalupas, that's what they called them, these floating wooden rafts on rivers that you could get like five or six growth cycles a year, not just two.
[02:16:32.380 --> 02:16:36.641]  So they had a huge population and meat was on the dish.
[02:16:36.661 --> 02:16:37.642]  I mean, who doesn't like meat?
[02:16:40.143 --> 02:16:41.724]  Human flesh tastes like pork, they say.
[02:16:41.764 --> 02:16:42.865]  It was delicious and succulent.
[02:16:43.326 --> 02:16:44.507]  Okay, I support it.
[02:16:44.547 --> 02:16:45.328]  I support all government.
[02:16:45.708 --> 02:16:47.230]  Not supporting government's hateful and evil.
[02:16:47.290 --> 02:16:48.431]  I don't want to be an extremist.
[02:16:48.991 --> 02:16:50.133]  Let's talk to Don in Tennessee.
[02:16:50.153 --> 02:16:50.813]  Don, you're on the air.
[02:16:50.833 --> 02:16:51.134]  Go ahead.
[02:16:51.154 --> 02:16:52.855]  Of course, they're reinventing all that now.
[02:16:53.276 --> 02:16:55.058]  They're reinventing government's God.
[02:16:55.118 --> 02:16:56.359]  Bow down to it.
[02:16:56.379 --> 02:16:57.180]  Do whatever it says.
[02:16:57.220 --> 02:16:58.000]  Give us total power.
[02:16:58.641 --> 02:17:16.092]  And so they're taking the offering now, taking your baby's diaper off, so the pedo, TSA person that likes to look at that, and some of them have the job, you can see the ones, I'll go, look at that one, he's looking at that hot chick, he's gonna grab her, they're gonna buzz her, oh yeah, oh yeah, and we'll sit there and drink coffee, going, oh yeah, look at that, ooh, they're going after her, look at that woman.
[02:17:16.692 --> 02:17:25.538]  And we're walking up to this rock concert with one of my friend's wives, looks like a Miss America, and they flagged her
[02:17:27.148 --> 02:17:27.809]  And it was a woman.
[02:17:28.609 --> 02:17:31.732]  And boy, let me tell you, she took her time and was drooling.
[02:17:32.413 --> 02:17:43.743]  And let me tell you, she got, I was sat there and watched it, and she grabbed her crotch, grabbed her hind, and I know you want to go in, and then grabbed her breast right in front of me, and I'm sorry this is pornographic, this is what they do in America.
[02:17:45.064 --> 02:17:47.206]  And the guys were all laughing and looking at us going...
[02:17:48.752 --> 02:17:55.558]  I mean, it was almost going to be like, Baka-chicka-wow-wow-wow-chicka-now, Baka-chicka-wow-wow, land of the free, home of the brave.
[02:17:55.838 --> 02:17:59.981]  Oh, it's land of the free if you want to get a job as a security person, because you... But I don't blame that woman.
[02:18:00.001 --> 02:18:02.624]  I mean, you know, she is an attractive woman, but that woman don't like you.
[02:18:02.664 --> 02:18:03.424]  She likes men, see?
[02:18:03.484 --> 02:18:04.665]  But it doesn't matter.
[02:18:04.705 --> 02:18:05.246]  You get that.
[02:18:05.286 --> 02:18:06.066]  Do whatever you want.
[02:18:06.287 --> 02:18:07.668]  It's all about your power.
[02:18:07.988 --> 02:18:09.970]  And next, it will be eating children.
[02:18:11.348 --> 02:18:13.030]  I'm telling you, they get their way for the Earth.
[02:18:13.771 --> 02:18:21.320]  Actually, the UN Biological Diversity Assessment 1996 actually says they want to reintroduce human sacrifice like the Aztecs.
[02:18:21.340 --> 02:18:22.742]  So see, they're already promoting it.
[02:18:22.762 --> 02:18:23.943]  I'm not joking if you just tuned in.
[02:18:24.303 --> 02:18:25.685]  Don in Tennessee, I apologize.
[02:18:25.765 --> 02:18:27.788]  Sir, you've been holding like a real trooper.
[02:18:27.828 --> 02:18:28.188]  Go ahead.
[02:18:30.120 --> 02:18:34.443]  Over the past year, federal funds for hospital care of the poor have been cut.
[02:18:34.964 --> 02:18:38.366]  I mean, this means orderlies, nurses, doctors have been let go.
[02:18:39.107 --> 02:18:43.109]  At one hospital here in town, 800 people have been let go.
[02:18:43.209 --> 02:18:45.731]  At another one, 400 people were let go.
[02:18:46.352 --> 02:18:49.914]  And they even cut the size of the lunchroom in half.
[02:18:50.174 --> 02:18:51.956]  No, no, it's a devastating operation.
[02:18:51.996 --> 02:18:53.317]  They're shutting everything down.
[02:18:53.337 --> 02:18:56.679]  300,000 just lost their health care, set to double in Florida.
[02:18:57.019 --> 02:18:57.840]  I mean, isn't this great?
[02:18:58.666 --> 02:19:09.710]  This is a substantial effect on at least our local economy because they've sent a lot of the factory jobs overseas and these are the last kind of golden nuggets.
[02:19:10.950 --> 02:19:15.471]  And they're going to cut the welfare, and they're going to cut the food stamps right at the same time.
[02:19:15.511 --> 02:19:16.072]  How's that sound?
[02:19:17.092 --> 02:19:23.454]  Well, I'm retired so I'm a little bit out of the mess, but thanks for listening to me.
[02:19:24.298 --> 02:19:25.719]  No, listen, sir, I appreciate you holding.
[02:19:25.739 --> 02:19:27.721]  I want you to continue and even hold over if you need to.
[02:19:28.281 --> 02:19:30.923]  And actually, I make jokes out of it because it's so sad, it's gallows humor.
[02:19:31.503 --> 02:19:34.105]  They are devastating the economy right now.
[02:19:34.805 --> 02:19:38.868]  And did you see where they're hiring armed guards now for financial collapse?
[02:19:39.609 --> 02:19:41.450]  At the Federal Biz Opportunities website?
[02:19:42.251 --> 02:19:46.534]  Yes, sir, I heard about that on Joyce's show, too.
[02:19:47.401 --> 02:19:49.822]  But I mean, you understand that this is all planned out.
[02:19:50.303 --> 02:19:51.723]  That's at InfoWars.com.
[02:19:52.364 --> 02:19:53.504]  This is all planned out.
[02:19:53.524 --> 02:19:54.045]  Do you understand?
[02:19:55.185 --> 02:19:58.227]  Well, it certainly looks planned out.
[02:19:58.868 --> 02:20:12.875]  One thing that kind of disturbed me is I like to write letters to my congressman, and during the federal shutdown, they actually let some of the office workers for the senators and stuff go hang.
[02:20:13.476 --> 02:20:16.998]  I'm still waiting for letters, reply letters from my congressman.
[02:20:17.785 --> 02:20:20.989]  It looks like the whole democracy is shutting down if you ask me.
[02:20:24.853 --> 02:20:25.634]  Well, sir, here's the deal.
[02:20:25.654 --> 02:20:27.156]  I don't want to scare you as a retiree.
[02:20:27.816 --> 02:20:30.900]  Let me tell you the big plan.
[02:20:31.761 --> 02:20:32.402]  When we come back.
[02:20:34.510 --> 02:20:36.952]  An e-cig revolution is sweeping across the country.
[02:20:37.293 --> 02:20:38.834]  But is yours American made?
[02:20:39.214 --> 02:20:41.236]  Vapriate e-liquid by Le Cig is.
[02:20:41.676 --> 02:20:45.339]  Manufactured in Arkansas with 100% USA sourced ingredients.
[02:20:45.660 --> 02:20:48.602]  And when you buy American, you support local jobs.
[02:20:48.982 --> 02:20:52.505]  Vapriate e-liquid by Le Cig is top quality at an affordable price.
[02:20:52.785 --> 02:20:55.588]  The very principle that once drove the American economy.
[02:20:56.028 --> 02:20:58.589]  Get great taste with no ash, tar, or smoke.
[02:20:58.889 --> 02:21:03.010]  You'll be wondering why you didn't make the change to Vapriate e-liquid by LASIG a long time ago.

[02:22:39.326 --> 02:22:46.568]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[02:22:46.708 --> 02:22:49.869]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supplies.
[02:22:50.029 --> 02:22:51.851]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[02:22:52.051 --> 02:22:56.635]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[02:22:56.715 --> 02:22:59.398]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[02:22:59.618 --> 02:23:05.423]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.

[02:24:40.896 --> 02:24:50.228]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome the 44th President of the United States, Barack Hussein Obama, and his new presidential theme song.
[02:24:50.768 --> 02:24:52.691]  No longer will it be Hail to the Chief.
[02:24:53.191 --> 02:24:56.936]  No, it'll be called Riding the Obamacare Train.
[02:24:57.930 --> 02:25:01.492]  And let me tell ya, it's got sandpaper and razor blades.
[02:25:02.072 --> 02:25:09.255]  This is going to hurt as bad as you can imagine, because they've got even worse stuff coming up in the future.
[02:25:09.775 --> 02:25:19.639]  We hope you like being poor, and we hope you like the collapse of the economy, because it's called ploward and piven on steroids.
[02:25:19.799 --> 02:25:24.301]  Continuing, ladies and gentlemen, there's going to be national compulsory service.
[02:25:25.001 --> 02:25:30.783]  Because those of you on pension funds who think you're okay as the economy shuts down, think again!
[02:25:31.103 --> 02:25:36.725]  They're going to leverage the hundred million people that will be out of work against your pensions.
[02:25:37.125 --> 02:25:41.226]  The government will nationalize them and cut them in half day one.
[02:25:41.246 --> 02:25:45.068]  And then, in the years to come, they'll...
[02:25:46.148 --> 02:25:49.033]  Cut that even more until you have nothing.
[02:25:49.794 --> 02:25:54.722]  Except paramilitary forces shooting you in the street if you complain.
[02:25:55.483 --> 02:25:57.025]  You asked for it, America.
[02:25:57.646 --> 02:25:59.689]  Now you're going to get it.
[02:26:00.563 --> 02:26:08.130]  But at least the President's going to smile at you while they dismantle your life and come after your guns.
[02:26:08.490 --> 02:26:13.755]  Because if that isn't enough for you, there's a great civil war added to the deal.
[02:26:14.836 --> 02:26:19.180]  Oh, the takedown of America was planned for a long time.
[02:26:19.540 --> 02:26:24.445]  And now, Barack Hussein Obama is the closing.
[02:26:25.851 --> 02:26:26.631]  Grin and bear it.
[02:26:26.972 --> 02:26:27.932]  Say you enjoy it.
[02:26:28.572 --> 02:26:30.193]  Or you'll be called a racist.
[02:26:30.693 --> 02:26:35.796]  And we know you'd throw your children into a mineshaft before you've allowed that to happen.
[02:26:36.336 --> 02:26:39.377]  So, America, you want to be slaves?
[02:26:39.918 --> 02:26:40.558]  You are.
[02:26:41.078 --> 02:26:43.760]  Barack Obama, hail to the chief.
[02:26:44.700 --> 02:26:47.421]  Obama does America right.
[02:26:49.002 --> 02:26:50.123]  Alright, there you go folks.
[02:26:50.143 --> 02:26:51.483]  A little bit of equal time.
[02:26:52.404 --> 02:26:54.925]  We have that announcement from the White House for you.
[02:26:57.403 --> 02:27:00.604]  Oh, is there still some more White House music?
[02:27:00.724 --> 02:27:01.384]  There you go!
[02:27:01.804 --> 02:27:03.325]  More White House theme music!
[02:27:13.809 --> 02:27:15.930]  Hey, look at the bailout, boys and girls!
[02:27:15.950 --> 02:27:17.711]  Talk about cool!
[02:27:18.311 --> 02:27:21.553]  There's nothing better than to bail out General Motors and ship it to China and Mexico!
[02:27:21.993 --> 02:27:22.713]  And Brazil!
[02:27:22.813 --> 02:27:23.174]  Ha ha!
[02:27:23.474 --> 02:27:24.394]  You don't like that?
[02:27:24.714 --> 02:27:26.475]  Well, there's more coming where that came from!
[02:27:26.855 --> 02:27:31.778]  And remember, George Washington's bad, private property's bad, and your kids don't belong to you!
[02:27:31.798 --> 02:27:34.419]  Or Rachel Maddow, I'll call you a racist!
[02:27:34.799 --> 02:27:42.163]  And we sure don't want some chick know-it-all, out-of-control, wannabe man telling us what to do, so we better bow down to her, huh?
[02:27:42.950 --> 02:27:43.651]  That's what we do.
[02:27:44.371 --> 02:27:45.852]  Alright, I apologize, I'm out of control.
[02:27:46.152 --> 02:27:50.756]  Yeah, just to tell the fellow from Tennessee, and I want you to keep your pension fund you paid for, sir.
[02:27:51.556 --> 02:27:55.779]  They're going to take your pension fund once the- they're setting up Homeland Security to do that.
[02:27:56.840 --> 02:27:57.741]  That's- it's set up.
[02:27:57.781 --> 02:28:03.205]  You notice this is all set up with the riot police going into place and everything just right on time, it's all prepared.
[02:28:03.885 --> 02:28:05.647]  But it's for your own good, I mean...
[02:28:07.406 --> 02:28:09.229]  You heard the theme song, folks.
[02:28:09.910 --> 02:28:11.272]  No more Hail to the Chief.
[02:28:12.014 --> 02:28:13.797]  Just for nostalgia, can we go out with Hail to the Chief?
[02:28:14.397 --> 02:28:15.339]  You can find it all over the place.
[02:28:15.379 --> 02:28:16.721]  I mean, it's just, I just love our Chief.
[02:28:18.324 --> 02:28:19.806]  I just love him so much right now.
[02:28:20.666 --> 02:28:25.127]  Let's go ahead and talk to Steve in Chicago.
[02:28:25.628 --> 02:28:26.888]  You're on the air, my friend.
[02:28:26.968 --> 02:28:27.348]  Welcome.
[02:28:27.648 --> 02:28:27.908]  Yes.
[02:28:28.909 --> 02:28:30.929]  Richard Gucciarri.
[02:28:31.389 --> 02:28:33.090]  Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[02:28:33.150 --> 02:28:33.950]  It's McGruff.
[02:28:34.590 --> 02:28:35.571]  Yeah, hey, McGruff.
[02:28:35.771 --> 02:28:37.691]  McGruff, are you liking your Obamacare now?
[02:28:38.972 --> 02:28:39.292]  A little.
[02:28:39.392 --> 02:28:41.733]  I tell you, Shoemaker can shine my shoes.
[02:28:43.053 --> 02:28:44.414]  Richard Gucciarri.
[02:28:45.094 --> 02:28:46.774]  He ain't shining your shoes, buddy.
[02:28:46.814 --> 02:28:48.215]  He's making international headlines.
[02:28:49.105 --> 02:28:52.268]  I mean, you really don't like Italians now, McGruff?
[02:28:52.568 --> 02:28:53.729]  But you like Obama?
[02:28:53.849 --> 02:29:00.956]  Like, like, like that governor of, uh, he'd be going into the federal building with a newspaper over his head.
[02:29:01.256 --> 02:29:03.518]  The guy from New Jersey, Chris Crispy.
[02:29:05.981 --> 02:29:07.102]  Well... Can you talk?
[02:29:07.322 --> 02:29:08.183]  I'll let you continue.
[02:29:08.203 --> 02:29:09.544]  You can say whatever you want.
[02:29:09.564 --> 02:29:11.285]  You gotta do it in the full McGruff sound.
[02:29:11.305 --> 02:29:11.566]  Go ahead.
[02:29:12.660 --> 02:29:13.021]  Okay.
[02:29:13.641 --> 02:29:18.186]  You had a caller yesterday, a cryptic caller that referred to British military intelligence in the Mideast.
[02:29:19.347 --> 02:29:20.548]  Yeah, he's exactly right.
[02:29:21.269 --> 02:29:23.791]  He talked about Kipling and of course Lawrence of Arabia.
[02:29:24.171 --> 02:29:34.822]  What we don't know, this is true though, the German Oriental Society was founded in 1897 and it was formed to combat Anglo-French interests in the Middle East.
[02:29:35.732 --> 02:29:42.695]  The idea of using Muslims as patsies to execute different attacks, this is well documented.
[02:29:42.715 --> 02:29:49.917]  Well, I mean, that goes back to the Byzantines with double-crossed people using Muslim, or Mohammedans as they called them, mercs.
[02:29:50.338 --> 02:29:52.378]  So this is actually about 600 years old.
[02:29:52.498 --> 02:29:53.579]  No, more than that.
[02:29:54.159 --> 02:29:54.799]  No, the Byzantines.
[02:29:54.839 --> 02:29:56.260]  Well, what was left of the Byzantine when it fell?
[02:29:56.980 --> 02:29:57.400]  No, no.
[02:29:57.780 --> 02:30:00.121]  Then Constantinople became Istanbul.
[02:30:02.342 --> 02:30:03.102]  Tell you what, stay there.
[02:30:03.582 --> 02:30:08.683]  I'm gonna come back to you, McGruff, because I want you to say, I'm McGruff, not a chick for bombs in your underwear.
[02:30:08.703 --> 02:30:10.344]  I'm free.
[02:30:11.164 --> 02:30:13.344]  Free to do a proctology exam on your wife.
[02:30:13.464 --> 02:30:14.645]  I'm the Texas State Police.
[02:30:15.025 --> 02:30:17.425]  Help take a bite out of somebody's dignity today.
[02:30:19.006 --> 02:30:19.906]  We're on the march.
[02:30:20.406 --> 02:30:22.006]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:22.926 --> 02:30:25.627]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:29.767 --> 02:30:30.608]  The facts are in.
[02:30:30.788 --> 02:30:31.908]  The studies are legion.
[02:30:32.209 --> 02:30:39.553]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[02:30:39.714 --> 02:30:43.176]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[02:30:43.536 --> 02:30:43.916]  Simple.
[02:30:44.116 --> 02:30:48.539]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[02:30:48.839 --> 02:30:54.263]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[02:30:54.543 --> 02:30:59.926]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield formulation.
[02:31:00.086 --> 02:31:10.531]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[02:31:10.871 --> 02:31:15.114]  Let's take a stand against the globalists by blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.

[02:31:29.765 --> 02:31:34.329]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[02:31:34.489 --> 02:31:34.869]  Why do we
[02:31:34.889 --> 02:31:42.814]  We have the highest cancer rates on the planet, the highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[02:31:43.134 --> 02:31:44.815]  It all comes down to one thing.
[02:31:45.076 --> 02:31:46.396]  We are what we eat.
[02:31:46.717 --> 02:31:51.060]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[02:31:51.380 --> 02:31:55.362]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[02:31:55.602 --> 02:31:57.884]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[02:31:58.164 --> 02:32:04.089]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[02:32:29.591 --> 02:32:39.982]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[02:32:40.302 --> 02:32:42.144]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[02:32:42.324 --> 02:32:43.004]  Fluoride.
[02:32:43.204 --> 02:32:44.785]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[02:32:45.125 --> 02:32:51.447]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[02:32:51.708 --> 02:32:54.529]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table.
[02:32:54.649 --> 02:32:56.509]  And the results are on record.
[02:32:56.629 --> 02:33:02.752]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[02:33:02.952 --> 02:33:05.113]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[02:33:05.373 --> 02:33:08.014]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[02:33:08.294 --> 02:33:11.675]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[02:33:11.795 --> 02:33:17.020]  You will find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:33:17.240 --> 02:33:22.045]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.

[02:33:42.887 --> 02:33:45.948]  You are either with the Republic or against it.
[02:33:47.309 --> 02:33:55.412]  Dogs of war are men of hate.
[02:33:55.452 --> 02:34:00.814]  No cause we don't discriminate.
[02:34:00.875 --> 02:34:05.096]  Discovery is to be disowned.
[02:34:06.357 --> 02:34:09.078]  Our currency is flammable.
[02:34:11.262 --> 02:34:15.497]  Wayne Madsen is our guest and back in June
[02:34:17.023 --> 02:34:18.984]  Of this year, the London Guardian interviewed him.
[02:34:19.564 --> 02:34:23.045]  He laid out how they're spying, where they were spying, what they're doing.
[02:34:23.685 --> 02:34:28.886]  But he pointed out Europe was also spying back, what was going on with it, and then they removed it.
[02:34:28.926 --> 02:34:30.246]  They didn't say it was discredited.
[02:34:30.266 --> 02:34:31.887]  They didn't say it existed.
[02:34:31.907 --> 02:34:34.227]  It was taken down less than a day later.
[02:34:34.267 --> 02:34:36.408]  Then they started having all these government operatives attack him.
[02:34:36.868 --> 02:34:41.289]  They had the White House run MSNBC come out and just say, oh, you know, Wayne Madsen's crazy.
[02:34:41.709 --> 02:34:43.109]  CNN attacked him.
[02:34:43.129 --> 02:34:44.670]  Who else attacked you?
[02:34:44.730 --> 02:34:44.910]  I mean,
[02:34:45.510 --> 02:34:50.013]  My point is, is that it shows... The Daily Beast!
[02:34:52.135 --> 02:34:52.575]  That's right.
[02:34:52.936 --> 02:35:00.701]  And Wayne, notice, it's not just that they're lapdogs and won't report the news, they attack real journalists who are getting death threats.
[02:35:00.741 --> 02:35:03.784]  I mean, these are enemy soldiers, basically.
[02:35:04.659 --> 02:35:08.041]  Well, you know, that whole issue, it was interesting.
[02:35:08.081 --> 02:35:16.805]  I mentioned how the Twitter campaign started, and it was both in the US and the UK, and then one of the guys in the UK was a guy named Damien Thompson.
[02:35:16.825 --> 02:35:23.748]  Now, he works for the Guardian and the Observer's competitor, the Daily Telegraph, which I call the Daily Torygraph.
[02:35:24.308 --> 02:35:28.391]  Yeah, you know, they're just in bed with the Tory party over there.
[02:35:28.991 --> 02:35:35.495]  And so, you know, that should have been no surprise that they would have attacked their competitor.
[02:35:35.535 --> 02:35:37.337]  But this was a Twitter campaign.
[02:35:37.377 --> 02:35:39.138]  And I would note, it's very interesting.
[02:35:39.598 --> 02:35:45.562]  NSA used to just maintain a system called Burst Brutes, and they've changed the name since I exposed it.
[02:35:45.922 --> 02:35:49.084]  But they would just keep track of journalists who wrote about NSA.
[02:35:49.144 --> 02:35:54.166]  Obviously they were after their sources, but it was done very quietly, very covertly.
[02:35:55.387 --> 02:35:58.488]  But now they're basically more aggressive.
[02:35:58.528 --> 02:36:04.391]  They're hiring, basically they got their shills out there, appearing on, as you said, MSNBC, CNN.
[02:36:04.931 --> 02:36:10.414]  They were on this Reliable Sources that used to be Howie Kurtz's show on CNN, where they
[02:36:11.274 --> 02:36:14.276]  Three guys with the Daily Beast all attacking me.
[02:36:15.657 --> 02:36:19.400]  You know, so that's great television journalism.
[02:36:19.840 --> 02:36:28.825]  But just more recently, the Association of Newspaper Editorial Writers had a meeting in where?
[02:36:28.926 --> 02:36:35.590]  Newport, Rhode Island, where they gave an award to the president of the Naval War College and it's his
[02:36:36.090 --> 02:37:00.176]  People, his professors that are launching the personal attacks against anyone who writes about NSA, NSA whistleblowers, Tom Drake, Bill Binney, Kirk Wiebe, Ray McGovern, myself, Jim Bamford, all these individuals are constantly being attacked out of the Naval War College on Naval War College time.
[02:37:00.556 --> 02:37:02.297]  They claim they're not using Naval War College
[02:37:02.777 --> 02:37:03.198]  Computers.
[02:37:03.538 --> 02:37:16.411]  But somebody on WordPress has a blog where they're attacking this group at the Naval War College, and the latest I heard is these professors think that I'm secretly running this blog on WordPress, which I'm not.
[02:37:16.751 --> 02:37:17.192]  I don't know.
[02:37:17.272 --> 02:37:17.933]  It's anonymous.
[02:37:17.953 --> 02:37:21.857]  I don't know who runs it, but they're apparently talking about threatening me with a lawsuit.
[02:37:21.997 --> 02:37:22.818]  I said, bring it on.
[02:37:23.158 --> 02:37:23.498]  Come on.
[02:37:23.819 --> 02:37:25.901]  I want any judge to laugh that one out.
[02:37:27.562 --> 02:37:36.469]  I might have to even subpoena their friends at NSA for their surveillance records to show that I have nothing to do with any blogs.
[02:37:36.749 --> 02:37:39.031]  Although I agree with what the blog is saying.
[02:37:39.071 --> 02:37:45.256]  They're saying that these guys are violating the Hatch Act by engaging in partisan political activity on government time.
[02:37:45.316 --> 02:37:46.217]  We're paying for this.
[02:37:46.897 --> 02:37:47.738]  Well it's famous.
[02:37:49.465 --> 02:37:55.287]  I mean, look at the announcements that they've now lifted the ban on domestic Pentagon lying and PSYOPs.
[02:37:55.887 --> 02:37:57.247]  And so that's going on.
[02:37:57.287 --> 02:38:03.549]  But separately, NSA propaganda video among the highest downvoted percentages in YouTube history.
[02:38:04.769 --> 02:38:05.689]  Simply amazing.
[02:38:05.749 --> 02:38:11.351]  The NSA director and the NSA Director General Alexander came out.
[02:38:12.191 --> 02:38:14.052]  And said we need to persecute the press.
[02:38:14.092 --> 02:38:16.113]  We need to go after anybody that does this.
[02:38:16.713 --> 02:38:21.695]  And it's got 14,561 dislikes.
[02:38:21.715 --> 02:38:22.896]  243 likes.
[02:38:23.536 --> 02:38:24.957]  And so, you know, here's the deal.
[02:38:25.417 --> 02:38:30.079]  Let the Pentagon come out and admit they're involved in domestic lying and propaganda.
[02:38:30.359 --> 02:38:31.800]  They're just being traitors to America.
[02:38:32.160 --> 02:38:33.480]  Let these people attack you.
[02:38:33.720 --> 02:38:35.301]  No one listens to them or believe in them.
[02:38:35.461 --> 02:38:37.282]  You want to beg them to attack you, Wayne?
[02:38:37.762 --> 02:38:39.083]  Oh, I enjoy it.
[02:38:39.103 --> 02:38:47.586]  Like I said, they can bring on all the lawsuits they want for frivolous claims.
[02:38:48.206 --> 02:38:53.148]  It's funny, Alexander gave an interview and I thought this was very bizarre.
[02:38:53.489 --> 02:39:00.572]  He likened people who object to NSA surveillance to little boys who don't want to take a bath or a shower.
[02:39:02.492 --> 02:39:03.653]  It's always perv talk.
[02:39:04.013 --> 02:39:04.973]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:39:05.013 --> 02:39:08.255]  The senator that said these are love pats from the TSA.
[02:39:08.275 --> 02:39:18.159]  Right, well maybe General Alexander should get together with Jerry Sandusky if he's got this thing about little boys not taking showers, you know?
[02:39:19.479 --> 02:39:22.420]  I'm telling you though, they always have this perv talk.
[02:39:22.821 --> 02:39:23.741]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:39:23.781 --> 02:39:28.263]  But I mean here it is, NSA Director General Alexander and cyber security and everyone hates him.
[02:39:29.147 --> 02:39:34.290]  And then he gets up there at the hacker conferences and talks to him in this droning mind control voice.
[02:39:34.890 --> 02:39:37.652]  And then they later admit he was trying to calm the audience.
[02:39:37.952 --> 02:39:38.972]  These people are crazy.
[02:39:39.332 --> 02:39:40.653]  No one's buying their baloney.
[02:39:40.893 --> 02:39:42.314]  Where do you think all this is going?
[02:39:42.374 --> 02:39:43.875]  Where's their train headed right now?
[02:39:44.732 --> 02:39:48.214]  Oh my god, well, I'll tell you, you know, NSA will survive this.
[02:39:48.794 --> 02:39:52.076]  I think Alexander may, well, he's going to be replaced anyway.
[02:39:52.096 --> 02:39:54.457]  He's being replaced with a Navy guy, Navy Admiral.
[02:39:54.857 --> 02:39:58.579]  We don't know much about him, but you know, these guys are always the same, you know.
[02:39:58.899 --> 02:40:06.323]  The NSA directors come and go, although Hayden and Alexander were at NSA longer than any other predecessors.
[02:40:06.323 --> 02:40:06.723]  We're good to go.
[02:40:26.605 --> 02:40:27.485]  You know, some new blood.
[02:40:27.525 --> 02:40:29.106]  But basically, these guys come and go.
[02:40:29.726 --> 02:40:34.468]  The issue at NSA is the civilians who remain there and really are running that show.
[02:40:34.948 --> 02:40:40.170]  And so NSA will continue to exist.
[02:40:40.350 --> 02:40:47.233]  They're talking about, you know, there's an internal commission or committee that was named that's going to come up with some reforms.
[02:40:47.293 --> 02:40:55.056]  I mean, that's like putting, you know, bank robbers on a committee on how to reduce bank thefts.
[02:40:55.236 --> 02:41:01.719]  Sure, it's a whitewash where they can suck in everybody and subpoena them and find out who's there and then make sure everybody gets cement shoes.
[02:41:02.079 --> 02:41:03.740]  I mean, that's how testimony works.
[02:41:04.781 --> 02:41:06.782]  I want to go to some phone calls across the board here.
[02:41:06.802 --> 02:41:08.102]  You'll be able to speak to it all, Wayne.
[02:41:09.023 --> 02:41:11.324]  But first off, the Google barges.
[02:41:12.724 --> 02:41:14.665]  They're launching a bunch of them in San Francisco.
[02:41:14.745 --> 02:41:18.167]  They admit that it's got Google personnel with the Department of Defense.
[02:41:18.547 --> 02:41:20.088]  We know Google's hooked in with NASA.
[02:41:20.108 --> 02:41:23.510]  They get Air Force prices on gasoline, Air Force refueling.
[02:41:24.330 --> 02:41:26.711]  And you've got these barges being built.
[02:41:26.751 --> 02:41:34.612]  The word is, even if they pass laws against this, these are going to hook into the Google Glasses and the NSA to where it won't matter.
[02:41:34.632 --> 02:41:44.715]  They'll be offshore with their own generators with diesel brought out to them to run their little NSA cubes offshore.
[02:41:45.415 --> 02:41:46.215]  What is your intel?
[02:41:46.903 --> 02:41:52.965]  Look, Google was, there's a CIA venture capital company called In-Q-Tel.
[02:41:53.766 --> 02:42:02.069]  In-Q-Tel and before it was something else, but this group exists to find up-and-coming tech companies, especially in the Bay Area, San Francisco.
[02:42:03.789 --> 02:42:04.950]  Give them seed money.
[02:42:05.310 --> 02:42:10.991]  And Google got seed money from the CIA to create this huge search engine.
[02:42:11.071 --> 02:42:14.031]  It was originally done for intelligence searches.
[02:42:14.531 --> 02:42:20.873]  And Oracle, that company, was found, it was CIA seed money to create relational database systems.
[02:42:20.933 --> 02:42:24.253]  Now we have Oracle Incorporated and Google Incorporated.
[02:42:24.293 --> 02:42:25.334]  We have Facebook.
[02:42:25.654 --> 02:42:27.634]  Facebook got CIA seed money.
[02:42:27.674 --> 02:42:31.795]  And Twitter, I would almost guess that Twitter is no exception.
[02:42:32.645 --> 02:42:33.986]  They had their IPO the other day.
[02:42:34.006 --> 02:42:38.167]  Well, even local news admits it's a Google operation and tied into Google Glasses.
[02:42:38.187 --> 02:42:48.952]  I mean, do you have any idea exactly what this flotilla of Cube-like little NSA command bases are they're building?
[02:42:49.437 --> 02:42:53.200]  Yeah, I'm not surprised they're on barges because it's like gambling barges.
[02:42:53.220 --> 02:43:00.485]  If the heat comes on gambling in these places, they'll just repaint the barges and go elsewhere.
[02:43:00.565 --> 02:43:02.527]  It's the same thing with the Google barges.
[02:43:02.867 --> 02:43:07.690]  They're very mobile, so they can do whatever they want until, you know, why did they pick the Bay Area?
[02:43:07.710 --> 02:43:09.492]  Because the one thing I know about the Bay Area,
[02:43:09.972 --> 02:43:13.195]  People in that area are very, very concerned about their privacy.
[02:43:13.215 --> 02:43:21.423]  They tend to be a lot more progressive in their thinking about government surveillance than other parts of the country.
[02:43:21.483 --> 02:43:25.587]  But I'm sure one of the reasons it's on their own barges is mobility.
[02:43:25.627 --> 02:43:26.648]  They can move them around.
[02:43:29.022 --> 02:43:32.063]  Other NSA points that we need to look at.
[02:43:32.763 --> 02:43:35.144]  They're now announcing, oh, those black boxes we mandated.
[02:43:35.404 --> 02:43:37.465]  They're going to wirelessly track you and tax you.
[02:43:37.765 --> 02:43:40.406]  And the NSA says we're allowed to track that without warrants.
[02:43:40.426 --> 02:43:44.127]  I mean, they can say they're allowed to move into my house, I guess, next.
[02:43:44.187 --> 02:43:47.889]  I mean, it is just out of control, what mad dogs.
[02:43:48.429 --> 02:43:49.789]  It's like a government riot.
[02:43:49.829 --> 02:43:52.690]  They're just, it's a spirit of do whatever we want to the people.
[02:43:53.371 --> 02:43:55.151]  Is it because of these corporate interests?
[02:43:55.631 --> 02:43:56.992]  I mean, why is it so corrupt?
[02:43:57.560 --> 02:44:02.064]  Yeah, NSA wouldn't be what NSA is today without the government contractors.
[02:44:02.104 --> 02:44:04.846]  I mean, after all, Snowden was a contractor for Booz Allen.
[02:44:05.306 --> 02:44:07.368]  And, you know, that's part of the mix.
[02:44:07.408 --> 02:44:08.409]  They make big bucks.
[02:44:08.749 --> 02:44:18.036]  When General Hayden took over NSA, you know, SAIC cleaned up on a major rehaul of the signals intelligence operations area.
[02:44:18.817 --> 02:44:21.599]  Money was wasted on this thing called Trailblazer.
[02:44:22.640 --> 02:44:26.643]  Hundreds, you know, hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars down the tubes.
[02:44:27.343 --> 02:44:32.109]  And all of Hayden's buddies at SEIC made out like bandits.
[02:44:32.289 --> 02:44:39.317]  And I'm glad, so we're paying for our own enslavement and they're getting rich in the process committing these crimes against our privacy while they gobble up America.
[02:44:39.737 --> 02:44:44.162]  I'm glad you brought that up because Hayden's on a train for those that forgot last week.
[02:44:45.826 --> 02:44:59.829]  Literally bragging, and from what I heard, threatening reporters, like, I can have you renditioned, I run everything, black sites, I'm in command, on a train babbling louder than I am, that he's just totally awesome.
[02:45:01.669 --> 02:45:08.011]  And of course, you've talked about him at CIA dinners you've been at and stuff, coming up and getting in your face.
[02:45:08.151 --> 02:45:15.072]  I mean, he just radiates to me the image of an absolute degenerate, I'm sorry.
[02:45:15.649 --> 02:45:27.992]  Yeah, well, I mean, Hayden, Hayden, uh, there's a lot, a lot of information on his background, too, when you even want to get into the perv stuff, too, but, uh, his exploits in Sarajevo, for example, during the Balkans.
[02:45:28.012 --> 02:45:29.052]  But I don't have any intel.
[02:45:29.072 --> 02:45:30.672]  I just look at him, and he's a creep.
[02:45:31.172 --> 02:45:35.373]  Yeah, well, but, hey, Hayden, look who Hayden's business partner is.
[02:45:35.473 --> 02:45:39.274]  You know, Hayden's in the Chair Top group, uh, with, uh, Michael Chair Top, so.
[02:45:39.941 --> 02:45:43.685]  You know, this is the gruesome twosome of surveillance, when you think about it.
[02:45:43.705 --> 02:45:54.515]  The naked body scanner guy, who makes money off videotaping your children's private parts, and then you got... And then you got Alexander coming by retiring, and he'll probably join them with his boys in the shower.
[02:45:55.177 --> 02:45:58.839]  You know, it sounds like the only guy they're missing is Jerry Sandusky.
[02:45:58.959 --> 02:46:06.123]  Let me ask this, with all your DC Madden intel, all the other stuff, what percentage of people are pedophiles versus just perverts?
[02:46:07.184 --> 02:46:10.606]  Like, what percentage are gay, heterosexual, or pedophiles in DC?
[02:46:11.446 --> 02:46:16.510]  As far as the gay, I remember Barney Frank when he was caught running a callboy service out of his house.
[02:46:16.550 --> 02:46:17.771]  With underage, with underage!
[02:46:17.891 --> 02:46:29.520]  Yeah, and he said, he said, if you, if you expel me or, you know, do anything other than a mild censure, I'm going to name 25% of the members of the house who I know for a fact are gay.
[02:46:29.880 --> 02:46:31.321]  So that was in the mid-80s.
[02:46:31.381 --> 02:46:34.664]  So there, there's a baseline from somebody, I have to believe this
[02:46:34.684 --> 02:46:36.165]  I mean, he would know.
[02:46:37.165 --> 02:46:42.569]  And the other thing is, most of those 25% back then happen to have been Republicans.
[02:46:43.789 --> 02:46:45.230]  Yeah, that's the word.
[02:46:45.310 --> 02:46:52.215]  Generally, Republicans are gay, and the Democrats like to rape women, usually, for some reason.
[02:46:52.255 --> 02:46:53.035]  Right, right.
[02:46:53.055 --> 02:46:55.256]  They're in the drunken debauchery business.
[02:46:55.296 --> 02:46:56.777]  No, but I'm serious.
[02:46:56.837 --> 02:46:57.538]  It keeps popping up.
[02:46:57.778 --> 02:47:04.142]  They beat up and rape women, and then the Republicans are gay, but then across the board, a large percentage are pedophiles.
[02:47:04.758 --> 02:47:17.528]  Yeah, a lot are, and I think it's very hard to put a percentage on that, but I mean, we had another guy back then, when Frank got caught, there was Jerry Studs, a congressman from Massachusetts.
[02:47:17.969 --> 02:47:23.413]  He was a Democrat, by the way, but he got caught with underage pages, but we've seen that over and over again.
[02:47:23.714 --> 02:47:28.798]  That's about an 8-10 year cycle in the Congress with these underage pages.
[02:47:29.358 --> 02:47:37.643]  We had these blow-ups in the early 80s, and then we had mid-80s, and then we had that guy... Well, we had the White House with the underage cowboys.
[02:47:37.703 --> 02:47:39.163]  That was in the Washington Times, remember that?
[02:47:39.183 --> 02:47:42.085]  At the end of the 80s, that story came out.
[02:47:42.505 --> 02:47:48.989]  That involved members of Congress, and we had what's-his-name Foley from Florida in the most recent one a few years back.
[02:47:50.706 --> 02:47:52.668]  Wow, well I want to go to some phone calls here.
[02:47:52.748 --> 02:47:55.731]  Brian and David and Anthony and Andrew and others.
[02:47:55.911 --> 02:47:58.554]  They'll be all over the map, but Brian says, is U.S.
[02:47:58.654 --> 02:48:02.398]  Special Forces OPVET and wants to talk about government contracting.
[02:48:02.898 --> 02:48:04.320]  He's probably got some comments on this.
[02:48:04.360 --> 02:48:05.341]  Go ahead, Brian.
[02:48:05.381 --> 02:48:05.961]  Thanks for holding.
[02:48:07.122 --> 02:48:10.045]  Yeah, I just had a couple of comments, Alex.
[02:48:11.187 --> 02:48:14.510]  What I wanted to mention about the contract, you were talking yesterday about
[02:48:15.319 --> 02:48:18.581]  How much the police has been militarized in the U.S.
[02:48:18.982 --> 02:48:38.034]  and I was at a gun shop the other day and there was a guy wearing full multi-cam, state police, Texas state police, and had a pistol on his side, drop leg holster, you know, looked like he was out of Wyatt Earp days or something, but it was like full multi-cam.
[02:48:38.074 --> 02:48:38.975]  It's something that you would see
[02:48:39.905 --> 02:48:57.774]  Overseas and so you see this militarization of what you're talking about and then you see the mentality of what you always say the guys are getting their eyes out at you and a lot of this is It's some of this is implemented from the prime vendor contract From you know, there's like four of us or the prime vendors.
[02:48:58.134 --> 02:48:59.014]  They changed the name of it.
[02:48:59.615 --> 02:49:05.577]  It's the tailored logistics Support contract I believe now so basically
[02:49:07.498 --> 02:49:13.945]  There was a sales strategy shift where the government contractors, I think, after they realized that the U.S.
[02:49:13.965 --> 02:49:18.130]  would be pulling out of the Middle East, you know, they were making a bunch of money for a long time.
[02:49:18.790 --> 02:49:23.756]  But then once it started to scale down, they were trying to figure out, you know, how are we going to make money?
[02:49:24.336 --> 02:49:25.658]  How are we going to continue to make money?
[02:49:26.198 --> 02:49:27.660]  And then also, who are we going to sell to?
[02:49:28.786 --> 02:49:36.829]  That's right, they're on record now saying they're now going to make the veterans and gun owners their new enemy, and the government's giving them the funds to turn every town into Fallujah.
[02:49:36.869 --> 02:49:37.809]  Go ahead, finish your point.
[02:49:38.610 --> 02:49:44.752]  Well, basically, you know, the veterans, I mean, a lot of them are patriots, the ones that aren't.
[02:49:45.072 --> 02:49:49.814]  Everybody, you know, they still kind of want to live out some of the experience.
[02:49:50.644 --> 02:49:50.964]  I don't think so.
[02:50:15.382 --> 02:50:16.722]  At Sacramento, yeah.
[02:50:16.762 --> 02:50:20.284]  Now they just, any excuse to shake us down and teach us we're slaves.
[02:50:20.884 --> 02:50:25.425]  And the cops don't get, they're being given this evil power because the globalists are getting ready to take us down.
[02:50:25.525 --> 02:50:27.826]  I mean, these cops are going to have their family bankrupt.
[02:50:27.886 --> 02:50:29.027]  Mama ain't going to have a house.
[02:50:29.467 --> 02:50:32.328]  I mean, you guys are literally helping bring on our destruction.
[02:50:32.788 --> 02:50:35.289]  The good news is I see the police actually waking up.
[02:50:36.169 --> 02:50:37.429]  But the problem is they don't care.
[02:50:37.449 --> 02:50:41.931]  They just put those guys on, you know, duty writing tickets and then they put the guy that wants to be Rambo
[02:50:42.691 --> 02:50:46.013]  In charge, you know, of a Humvee with a machine gun on it at a checkpoint.
[02:50:46.533 --> 02:50:47.434]  And he'd pull up to it.
[02:50:47.474 --> 02:50:51.836]  I mean, now they have checkpoints with active duty Marines in California searching people.
[02:50:52.296 --> 02:50:53.257]  I mean, it's totally evil.
[02:50:53.277 --> 02:50:54.338]  They're getting ready for collapse.
[02:50:55.198 --> 02:50:56.559]  But any other points?
[02:50:56.579 --> 02:50:58.920]  Yeah, just two real quick points.
[02:50:59.541 --> 02:51:04.383]  One thing, Art Acevedo, right before you had him on your show, I tried to get in at the time.
[02:51:05.004 --> 02:51:08.946]  There was a big Texas police chief meeting, retired and I think current.
[02:51:09.246 --> 02:51:09.786]  Stay there!
[02:51:09.806 --> 02:51:10.226]  Stay there!
[02:51:10.246 --> 02:51:11.227]  I want to hear this!

[02:52:29.524 --> 02:52:32.985]  It's been said, those who control the food control the people.
[02:52:33.185 --> 02:52:36.926]  Are you concerned about GMO foods making you sick and affecting your mind?
[02:52:37.006 --> 02:52:42.947]  Many people suffer from lack of energy, insomnia, loss of stamina, weight gain, and the inability to think clearly.
[02:52:43.207 --> 02:52:46.968]  Genetically modified crops, processed foods, and toxic chemicals can

[02:53:29.237 --> 02:53:30.117]  The facts are in.
[02:53:30.257 --> 02:53:31.398]  The studies are legion.
[02:53:31.678 --> 02:53:39.082]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[02:53:39.182 --> 02:53:42.624]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[02:53:43.004 --> 02:53:43.425]  Simple.
[02:53:43.565 --> 02:53:48.028]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[02:53:48.289 --> 02:53:53.753]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[02:53:54.013 --> 02:53:59.378]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield Formulation.

[02:54:27.017 --> 02:54:28.478]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:54:36.115 --> 02:54:37.996]  WayneMadsonReport.com is his site.
[02:54:38.016 --> 02:54:44.219]  We're going to tell you about his new book, breaking all this NSA information down in a moment, then go back to other calls.
[02:54:44.719 --> 02:54:45.819]  Brian in Texas.
[02:54:45.859 --> 02:54:48.701]  Yeah, Art Acevedo, you know, he says he'll come back on the show.
[02:54:49.421 --> 02:54:54.824]  He does stuff like when we have the mayor pro-team says, once we do register your guns, then we will ban them.
[02:54:56.044 --> 02:55:02.847]  And then they were yelling at a guy that had a sign, and then Art Acevedo goes, oh, but he was really, your guy was really cussing.
[02:55:02.867 --> 02:55:04.148]  Went back to the video, he wasn't.
[02:55:05.017 --> 02:55:07.978]  He just really is like PSYOP trained, man.
[02:55:09.138 --> 02:55:11.019]  You'll almost be convinced by what he's saying.
[02:55:11.719 --> 02:55:12.780]  And it's amazing.
[02:55:12.900 --> 02:55:20.502]  So tell us at this police chief meeting what your friend, this retired police chief, said, Arte Sevedo said.
[02:55:20.702 --> 02:55:22.403]  Look, I know he wouldn't be getting invited.
[02:55:23.163 --> 02:55:29.226]  So what I was told was that he basically got up in front of everybody and was trying to convince all these police chiefs that we really have to move forward.
[02:55:47.566 --> 02:56:01.338]  You know, some sort of gun control policy and that, um, uh, that's a whole, you know, auditorium of all these current and previous police chiefs that it was just like an awkward silence that everybody kind of started looking around at each other.
[02:56:01.378 --> 02:56:12.308]  So it didn't go over well with a lot of, I guess there's a lot of Texas Patriots still left and, uh, and so it didn't go over well and it was just a very kind of awkward moment, I think, for him and for everybody in the room.
[02:56:13.349 --> 02:56:13.429]  Um,
[02:56:14.275 --> 02:56:15.636]  So, that was refreshing to hear.
[02:56:15.676 --> 02:56:19.638]  I wanted to try to, you know, get online to actually ask him directly about that.
[02:56:19.738 --> 02:56:23.060]  Because you could probably find out what the conference is.
[02:56:23.080 --> 02:56:25.021]  I don't know if it happens once a year.
[02:56:25.061 --> 02:56:26.222]  I'll actually try to find out myself.
[02:56:26.242 --> 02:56:27.983]  Well, he's on record saying that.
[02:56:28.103 --> 02:56:30.945]  And, you know, his dad ran guns into Cuba against Fidel.
[02:56:31.445 --> 02:56:32.206]  That's why I've told him.
[02:56:32.266 --> 02:56:34.627]  I said, look, you say you're not a communist, but go join Fidel.
[02:56:34.647 --> 02:56:35.488]  They took the guns there.
[02:56:35.508 --> 02:56:38.249]  I mean, I'm not...R-Day's event is a real charming guy.
[02:56:38.289 --> 02:56:41.351]  But, man, I tell you, you know, it's really sad, folks.
[02:56:41.411 --> 02:56:42.432]  I appreciate your call.
[02:56:43.376 --> 02:56:52.399]  Let me tell you, their strategy is to turn the state red by bringing in Hispanic voters, making them legal, and then getting them to vote to take the guns.
[02:56:52.719 --> 02:56:57.421]  Why would folks fleeing Mexico where you can't own guns want to come here and then be disarmed here as well?
[02:56:59.302 --> 02:57:01.323]  I mean, that's, you know, it's just, it's so sick.
[02:57:01.383 --> 02:57:02.243]  It's so sick.
[02:57:03.784 --> 02:57:06.565]  Let's get Wayne Madsen's take on what he just heard.
[02:57:07.105 --> 02:57:10.026]  What is the disarmament agenda really all about, Wayne Madsen?
[02:57:11.129 --> 02:57:23.698]  Well, I mean, when you look at what's going on, you know, we had the UN adopt or approve this Small Arms Treaty.
[02:57:25.279 --> 02:57:32.604]  You know, every time they do that, though, they talk about small arms control around the world, yet
[02:57:33.941 --> 02:57:41.528]  When you go into these war zones, like Syria for example, they're still exporting these weapons to these rebel groups.
[02:57:41.568 --> 02:57:42.468]  And who are the rebels?
[02:57:42.749 --> 02:57:43.369]  Al Qaeda.
[02:57:44.590 --> 02:57:48.454]  It doesn't seem like there's any kind of logical policy at play here.
[02:57:50.055 --> 02:57:56.520]  And now we've got the government schools under Michelle Obama saying parents can't be trusted to pack their school lunches.
[02:57:56.981 --> 02:58:00.263]  Just broke at InfoWars.com by Steve Watson.
[02:58:00.864 --> 02:58:01.785]  School test
[02:58:03.413 --> 02:58:10.655]  Teachers, kids, commands, this is a quote, commands of government officials must be obeyed by all.
[02:58:11.355 --> 02:58:18.657]  Papers produced by Global Education Corporation, part of No Child Left Behind program, where they also teach 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[02:58:19.777 --> 02:58:25.498]  At its core, Wayne Madsen, NSA whistleblower, what is at the heart of this authoritarian takeover?
[02:58:25.998 --> 02:58:29.259]  And then tell us about your new book that folks can find at WayneMadsenReport.com.
[02:58:29.559 --> 02:58:32.240]  Well it's all about, you know, obeying orders.
[02:58:33.989 --> 02:58:35.291]  I thought it was interesting the other day.
[02:58:35.312 --> 02:58:38.637]  I read a story about a kid that pointed his finger at another child in school.
[02:58:40.239 --> 02:58:40.961]  Like, bang, bang.
[02:58:41.682 --> 02:58:43.004]  Kid was suspended immediately.
[02:58:43.024 --> 02:58:47.311]  I mean, who... Which one of us has never done something like that?
[02:58:50.134 --> 02:58:50.955]  Well, no, exactly.
[02:58:50.975 --> 02:58:53.957]  It's about we're all criminals now, for stuff that isn't criminal, but they're okay.
[02:58:54.237 --> 02:59:08.507]  And if you look on screen of your TV viewer, the name of Wayne Madsen's book, I'll give that to folks, National Security Agency Surveillance, Reflections and Revelations, 2001-2013, in paperback, Wayne Madsen's new book, National Security Agency.
