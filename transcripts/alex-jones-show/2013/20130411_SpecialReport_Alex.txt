[00:00:06.875 --> 00:00:12.277]  Facebook will launch its latest data mining device with the release of Facebook Home on April 12th.
[00:00:12.858 --> 00:00:21.021]  The company's new move into the lucrative mobile advertising market comes on the heels of last year's pump and dump scandal which cost investors billions.
[00:00:22.001 --> 00:00:29.744]  The mobile app will first be available to Android users and according to the site, from the moment you wake your phone, you'll be immersed in cover feed.
[00:00:30.768 --> 00:00:39.935]  Before, if you wanted to be inundated with the vacuous status updates of your friends and pictures of their half-eaten breakfast, you had to manually launch the Facebook app.
[00:00:40.716 --> 00:00:41.416]  Well, no more.
[00:00:41.877 --> 00:00:43.498]  Behold, the future.
[00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:58.190]  By replacing the unlock and home screen of your phone, the company that's determined to creep into every area of your life can now flood your phone with pictures, chat requests, and suggestions without even needing to be unlocked.
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.022]  With Facebook Home, you're basically authorizing the complete surrender of your privacy.
[00:01:04.442 --> 00:01:22.711]  Much like its web-based counterpart that is no stranger to privacy encroachment, Home will collect information like your location, how you connect with friends, what sort of apps you interact with, and your internet searches in order to personalize the advertising that will besiege your handheld device while it's awake.
[00:01:23.954 --> 00:01:30.838]  As we've reported before, Facebook is regularly used by the IRS to scan your account and Twitter feed while conducting audits.
[00:01:31.438 --> 00:01:40.944]  Now, if you launch an app via Facebook Home, information about your purchases could be stored and subject to subpoena, much like all the other information Facebook collects on you.
[00:01:41.624 --> 00:01:54.329]  Law enforcement officials also scour social networks using facial recognition software and have arrested people like this 20-year-old for posting a picture of graffiti to her Facebook-owned Instagram account.
[00:01:55.349 --> 00:02:03.112]  Even something as innocent as liking a religious or political page or attending a rally is collected and can be used against you.
[00:02:04.437 --> 00:02:15.821]  Why then would anyone want to be smartphone shackled to a social network that's known for mining and collecting data and then providing that information to advertisers and other nefarious systems?
[00:02:16.541 --> 00:02:25.725]  Basically, the app signals Facebook's ideal, to have you chronically connected to the Facebook interface so it can be the sole data house of citizen intelligence.
[00:02:26.385 --> 00:02:37.573]  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg emphasized that home is built around people, not apps, which means that users can spend more time interacting with their friends and families on their smartphones.
[00:02:38.313 --> 00:02:46.879]  Well, if by family he means keeping you perpetually connected to Big Brother, Big Sis, and DARPA, well kudos to you, Zuckerberg.
[00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:49.401]  Maybe you were right about your Facebook users.
