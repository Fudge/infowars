[00:00:04.731 --> 00:00:05.372]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.032 --> 00:00:07.052]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.793 --> 00:00:09.053]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.554 --> 00:00:10.394]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.154 --> 00:00:12.115]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.695 --> 00:00:16.257]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.877 --> 00:00:20.979]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.158 --> 00:00:35.980]  Well, all Hades is breaking loose in world markets, including gold.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:46.725]  The globalists are on record saying that they have been artificially suppressing the price of precious metals because it competes with their fiat currencies, which they're devaluing.
[00:00:47.505 --> 00:00:55.429]  But in the laws of finance and the laws of economics, gold and silver and other commodities will only go up over time.
[00:00:56.277 --> 00:01:06.868]  The insiders, of course, control the major stock markets and can go up and down and ride the rallies up and then, of course, trigger the declines downward.
[00:01:07.208 --> 00:01:13.474]  And that's all part of the record, from LIBOR and the fixing of interest rates to the plunge protection team.
[00:01:14.485 --> 00:01:18.929]  But I have expected that they could massively drive down gold.
[00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.533]  But if you look at a 12-13 year graph, it will only go back up later.
[00:01:23.593 --> 00:01:26.376]  That's why I'm not going to sell any of the gold or silver I have.
[00:01:26.656 --> 00:01:38.226]  And again, I don't have the gold and silver I have as an investment, as something to try to make a bunch of money, even though most of the gold I bought was when it was below $500, silver when it was below $10.
[00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:46.612]  I've taken the capital, extra capital, that's been brought in really since and put it into the news operations.
[00:01:46.672 --> 00:01:52.116]  But I do have an emergency backup nest egg, a little bit of cash, a little bit of gold and silver, a little bit of property.
[00:01:53.997 --> 00:02:02.342]  But personally, if they drove gold down to a thousand dollars an ounce, or if they drove gold down to six hundred dollars an ounce, I'm not going to sell it.
[00:02:02.602 --> 00:02:08.865]  Because that just shows what a totally manipulated society we're in, where they use naked shorting to do this.
[00:02:08.925 --> 00:02:09.406]  And we're going to get
[00:02:10.006 --> 00:02:16.550]  Gerald Cilente, Max Keiser to pop in today or tomorrow with their take on what's happening with this.
[00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.391]  And we will continue to track it.
[00:02:18.411 --> 00:02:25.094]  If you go up to DrudgeReport.com, we can punch this up on screen for people who are watching on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:02:25.134 --> 00:02:30.037]  They've got a live feed of what's going on there.
[00:02:31.738 --> 00:02:34.519]  The Bloomberg Gold is down 6.91%.
[00:02:38.937 --> 00:02:42.419]  6.91% to $1,380 an ounce.
[00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:44.480]  They're calling this a collapse.
[00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:50.483]  A collapse would be losing half its value is generally what you call a collapse, not 6.91.
[00:02:51.163 --> 00:02:52.864]  But they're trying to create a collapse.
[00:02:53.324 --> 00:02:54.164]  Here's the headlines.
[00:02:54.224 --> 00:02:56.645]  Gold set for worst two-day loss since 1983.
[00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.052]  I've got other headlines here where they're calling it a collapse.
[00:03:04.073 --> 00:03:06.235]  So that's the type of stuff that's going on.
[00:03:06.555 --> 00:03:08.256]  Investors bail amid collapse.
[00:03:08.497 --> 00:03:09.117]  There's the headline.
[00:03:09.417 --> 00:03:10.598]  Panic is everywhere.
[00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.680]  Worst two-day loss since 1983.
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.022]  So that's how the media is pushing it, ABC News.
[00:03:16.423 --> 00:03:19.845]  Gold investors exit amid price collapse.
[00:03:20.766 --> 00:03:23.608]  Meanwhile, you'll see Soros badmouth gold.
[00:03:23.628 --> 00:03:24.909]  You'll see other globalists do it.
[00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:27.411]  They just want to be able to drive it down to buy it.
[00:03:28.746 --> 00:03:34.944]  And they're forcing Cyprus to sell off its gold because Cyprus was signed on to prop up European bonds.
[00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:42.772]  And the EU is in the news today saying, we're doing great, everything is going according to plan, Europe's great!
[00:03:43.413 --> 00:03:47.295]  And they mean the globalists that are capturing Europe, destroying its middle class.
[00:03:47.335 --> 00:03:53.358]  You see, Europe must be impoverished, the United States must be impoverished, Canada must be impoverished.
[00:03:53.838 --> 00:03:59.442]  The Western world, from New Zealand to Canada, from the United States to Deutschland,
[00:04:00.242 --> 00:04:04.466]  From France to even Turkey's part of the West, really.
[00:04:04.846 --> 00:04:06.667]  They must all be impoverished.
[00:04:06.768 --> 00:04:10.811]  Eastern Europe, you name it, must be totally impoverished.
[00:04:11.131 --> 00:04:12.833]  That's the globalist philosophy.
[00:04:13.413 --> 00:04:15.495]  The globalists want America out of the way.
[00:04:16.836 --> 00:04:19.698]  Fighting with each other along racial and religious lines.
[00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:24.823]  Balkanized with a robber baron elite above the law who pay no taxes.
[00:04:25.704 --> 00:04:28.126]  And their minions pay less than a blue collar worker.
[00:04:29.164 --> 00:04:31.205]  Obama pays 18.4% taxes.
[00:04:31.585 --> 00:04:33.005]  That was in the Wall Street Journal yesterday.
[00:04:33.405 --> 00:04:36.286]  And by the way, it's the day you pay your money to the private Federal Reserve.
[00:04:36.687 --> 00:04:38.727]  Didn't have a Federal Reserve until 1913.
[00:04:38.767 --> 00:04:39.948]  Didn't have an income tax.
[00:04:41.328 --> 00:04:43.089]  How do we build America without it?
[00:04:43.709 --> 00:04:46.910]  They use the income tax as like tying the boat to the dock.
[00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.732]  So no matter how fast you rev the engine and the propeller, you never leave the dock.
[00:04:52.252 --> 00:04:53.072]  It's all coming up.
[00:04:53.172 --> 00:04:56.373]  Plus the massive attacks on the Second Amendment and more.
[00:04:56.834 --> 00:04:57.454]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:01.511]  I had tried everything.
[00:05:01.571 --> 00:05:06.634]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating, I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[00:05:07.054 --> 00:05:11.537]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[00:05:11.877 --> 00:05:18.261]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[00:05:18.741 --> 00:05:29.226]  Now there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[00:05:29.947 --> 00:05:34.089]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[00:05:34.429 --> 00:05:40.452]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[00:05:40.692 --> 00:05:41.813]  Now that's results.

[00:07:00.057 --> 00:07:08.302]  Devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, or the threat of martial law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies.
[00:07:08.602 --> 00:07:12.044]  As a result, millions are stockpiling food, gold, and weapons.

[00:08:26.259 --> 00:08:31.203]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Monday, the 15th day
[00:08:33.459 --> 00:08:34.100]  of April 2013.
[00:08:36.403 --> 00:08:44.012]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and we're going to be here, Lord willing, for the next three hours today.
[00:08:47.009 --> 00:09:03.796]  And we're going to have pop in at the bottom of the next hour, Richard Belzer's got a new book out on the Kennedy assassination hit list that has the most compelling evidence that it was an inside job with more people involved than Lee Harvey Oswald, obviously, because of the hundreds of people that were murdered to cover it up.
[00:09:03.876 --> 00:09:07.017]  The witnesses, you name it, and the 50th anniversary.
[00:09:08.057 --> 00:09:13.119]  Coming up, we're going to be talking about some of that today.
[00:09:13.799 --> 00:09:17.240]  Obviously, the globalists on record are manipulating interest rates.
[00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:18.741]  They're manipulating gold prices.
[00:09:19.261 --> 00:09:25.383]  They just use paper fiat to drive down the prices.
[00:09:26.244 --> 00:09:32.686]  There is a lot going on today that we are going to be breaking down.
[00:09:34.195 --> 00:09:36.417]  We've got developments on the North Korean front.
[00:09:36.477 --> 00:09:37.598]  North Korea brands U.S.
[00:09:37.638 --> 00:09:38.598]  an enemy of the state.
[00:09:39.859 --> 00:09:47.345]  Yeah, our governments demonize the Founding Fathers and the Patriots, Christians, you name it, as enemies of the state, so why not?
[00:09:47.365 --> 00:09:49.767]  In fact, North Korea should love the U.S.
[00:09:49.807 --> 00:09:50.148]  government.
[00:09:50.188 --> 00:09:53.010]  I mean, it acts more and more just like they do.
[00:09:54.211 --> 00:09:58.334]  And the North Korean government is saying they're ready to launch missiles.
[00:09:58.394 --> 00:10:00.356]  South Korean Defense Minister concurs.
[00:10:01.236 --> 00:10:17.345]  That that is going on just all part of another terrorist government menacing everyone so that they can get more oil, more food, more weapons.
[00:10:18.205 --> 00:10:19.226]  That's what our government does.
[00:10:19.306 --> 00:10:28.691]  It's like, give us all your rights, give us all your liberties, let us spy on you without warrants, let us secretly arrest you, or Al-Qaeda will come and murder you and your family and blow you up.
[00:10:29.701 --> 00:10:38.929]  North Korea says give us money, give us oil, give us all this power, or we will launch nuclear missiles at you.
[00:10:40.871 --> 00:10:42.152]  And why produce anything?
[00:10:42.712 --> 00:10:47.777]  Why not just take over society and menace everyone when you're the only ones that have the guns?
[00:10:48.717 --> 00:10:57.321]  But before this dream of the total state can take place, they need to first disarm the American people.
[00:10:57.581 --> 00:11:11.007]  It doesn't look good in the New World Order for the main engine of the empire, the military engine and propaganda engine of the transhumanist, eugenicist, death cult-based, control freak religion of world government.
[00:11:11.567 --> 00:11:12.608]  If the United States
[00:11:13.592 --> 00:11:32.146]  If we can still have families living in homes together, if the United States still has a high standard of living, if the United States is still armed, the power structure cannot and will not put up with that.
[00:11:32.686 --> 00:11:37.590]  And that's why there is the move to disarm the American people.
[00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:43.531]  I mean, it's very simple, and they're putting their full-court press in just everywhere.
[00:11:43.651 --> 00:11:52.813]  Every one of their operatives, from Bob Costas to Bill Maher, are there saying, just get rid of the Second Amendment.
[00:11:53.593 --> 00:11:54.793]  Get rid of it completely.
[00:11:54.853 --> 00:12:03.495]  In fact, this was Bill Maher, Friday night, on his HBO program, expletive-laden, just saying, hey, let's just get rid of the citizens' right.
[00:12:03.795 --> 00:12:04.875]  You never had a right.
[00:12:04.915 --> 00:12:08.276]  He goes on to say, the full video is up on Infowars.com.
[00:12:09.136 --> 00:12:11.357]  The Second Amendment is BS, he says.
[00:12:11.577 --> 00:12:12.297]  Let's play that clip.
[00:12:12.317 --> 00:12:17.619]  I'm sorry, but this is the problem with the gun debate, is that it's a constant center-right debate.
[00:12:17.679 --> 00:12:19.300]  There's no left in this debate.
[00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:24.342]  Everyone on the left is so afraid to say what should be said, which is the Second Amendment is bull****.
[00:12:25.282 --> 00:12:28.023]  Why doesn't anyone go at the core of it?
[00:12:28.583 --> 00:12:29.404]  And then they go on.
[00:12:29.424 --> 00:12:32.105]  You can watch the full video to say there is no individual right.
[00:12:32.425 --> 00:12:38.307]  Well, then how can the government have guns if the government is by the consent of the governed?
[00:12:39.824 --> 00:12:42.166]  I mean, our country fought a war.
[00:12:45.889 --> 00:12:48.791]  Our country began out of the attempt to take the guns.
[00:12:50.533 --> 00:12:55.237]  And the examples of this just go on and on and on.
[00:12:55.257 --> 00:12:58.520]  And it makes me sick to know we're going into bondage.
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.102]  You notice they're taking all the other rights and liberties right now.
[00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:04.922]  You notice right now, they're trying to say we don't have any rights.
[00:13:05.303 --> 00:13:06.564]  We don't have any, quote, privileges.
[00:13:06.624 --> 00:13:11.067]  Well, the Bill of Rights and Constitution and Declaration of Independence are not a list of privileges.
[00:13:11.107 --> 00:13:14.330]  They're a list of rights that exist of all free human beings.
[00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:20.535]  You don't need to hear a law that says it's wrong to grab somebody's child out of the backyard and molest them.
[00:13:20.975 --> 00:13:24.938]  Because you have a conscience, and you're not inherently an evil person.
[00:13:25.339 --> 00:13:26.820]  You don't want to do that.
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:30.423]  In fact, if you hear about it in the news, you're horrified by it.
[00:13:32.081 --> 00:13:39.706]  A couple's been charged with, you know, the baby was crying so they reportedly smothered it with a pillow.
[00:13:40.206 --> 00:13:45.550]  You don't need to be told that's horrible to know that it's wrong.
[00:13:46.587 --> 00:13:48.688]  You don't need to be told abortion's wrong.
[00:13:49.009 --> 00:13:49.789]  You know inherently.
[00:13:50.169 --> 00:13:58.455]  Especially when it's nine months old, and the baby slips out, so they chop it up there on the table while it begs for its life, and literally fights the scalpel.
[00:13:58.855 --> 00:14:08.822]  That's coming out in these different court hearings about abortionists, where they're just filthy facilities, where they make jokes with the dead babies, you know, selling the body parts.
[00:14:08.862 --> 00:14:10.763]  A lot of them do weird rituals.
[00:14:11.063 --> 00:14:13.465]  Of course, who do you think wants to be an abortionist?
[00:14:13.805 --> 00:14:16.287]  A large portion of them are into black magic.
[00:14:17.187 --> 00:14:18.308]  It just keeps coming out.
[00:14:18.828 --> 00:14:20.308]  Of course they're into black magic.
[00:14:20.608 --> 00:14:22.129]  People that do partial birth abortions.
[00:14:22.149 --> 00:14:36.093]  I mean, you can have somebody who thinks it's really a right, no it's not really a human, and you know, they do first trimester abortions, and you could have some argument there in their minds at least, I don't agree with it, that hey, you know, this isn't really a human yet.
[00:14:36.613 --> 00:14:39.854]  But see, now it's hey, let's kill people up to three years of age.
[00:14:40.215 --> 00:14:41.215]  Hey, let's go ahead and
[00:14:42.443 --> 00:14:43.564]  Shoot grandma in the head.
[00:14:43.744 --> 00:14:44.805]  Let's go ahead and... No, no.
[00:14:44.965 --> 00:14:45.585]  That'd be too nice.
[00:14:45.625 --> 00:14:47.367]  Let's dehydrate grandma.
[00:14:49.108 --> 00:14:52.590]  Let's dehydrate grandma.
[00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:56.213]  That's the best way to get rid of her.
[00:14:57.434 --> 00:14:58.815]  And that just goes on everywhere.
[00:14:58.915 --> 00:15:06.920]  So the point is, when we stop caring about each other, when we stop caring about checks and balances and liberties, there's no foundation.
[00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:07.741]  There's no floor.
[00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:15.315]  Everything falls to the absolute core of tyranny.
[00:15:16.255 --> 00:15:18.957]  So the worst of the worst then set the standard.
[00:15:21.599 --> 00:15:37.191]  And that's what the establishment historically has known, at least in the West in the last 400 years, and realized that more liberty, more checks and balances means more chances for them to have a future and not have a new government come to power that actually robs them.
[00:15:38.288 --> 00:15:55.439]  These tyrannies are very dangerous for the establishment itself, but they're such an anti-family, such an evil possessed lust for death and destruction and to really tear down the foundations of manhood and womanhood and childhood.
[00:15:55.719 --> 00:15:58.961]  They're such an evil animating this.
[00:15:59.201 --> 00:16:03.764]  This is not some government, true believer, socialist utopia they're building.
[00:16:04.744 --> 00:16:07.126]  They're building a hellish world.
[00:16:09.281 --> 00:16:11.923]  And you can look at the fruits of collectivism.
[00:16:12.203 --> 00:16:14.045]  And fascism is a collectivist system.
[00:16:14.385 --> 00:16:16.266]  Socialism that leads to communism is.
[00:16:17.427 --> 00:16:20.029]  They try to dress them up like fake choices in the colleges.
[00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:21.731]  That's not the real political paradigm.
[00:16:21.971 --> 00:16:30.598]  Before 150 years ago, it was taught that the left and right were male-female.
[00:16:31.776 --> 00:16:34.917]  Sinister was the left, associated with Eve, the devil.
[00:16:35.898 --> 00:16:36.258]  Okay?
[00:16:36.818 --> 00:16:38.539]  That's the only left and right that there is.
[00:16:38.639 --> 00:16:58.248]  And so the Illuminati in France began to promote 200 years ago, roughly, about 215 years ago, this is all mainline history books, the left-right paradigm for politics out of their ancient religion.
[00:16:59.127 --> 00:17:00.028]  Which is just magic.
[00:17:00.529 --> 00:17:01.910]  Or the occult, the hidden.
[00:17:02.451 --> 00:17:06.074]  Before that, the debate was less liberty or more liberty.
[00:17:07.556 --> 00:17:09.058]  More freedom or less freedom.
[00:17:09.598 --> 00:17:12.621]  Is this a tyrant or is this not a tyrant?
[00:17:13.022 --> 00:17:13.903]  Is it just?
[00:17:14.083 --> 00:17:15.685]  Is there justice?
[00:17:16.305 --> 00:17:17.667]  Justice for all.
[00:17:21.448 --> 00:17:27.210]  Because you had a sense of justice because you were an upright, moral, noble person.
[00:17:27.591 --> 00:17:34.854]  Nobility didn't just mean that you came from a royal family or a top family.
[00:17:35.434 --> 00:17:38.815]  It meant that you were noble in your bearing, that you led your troops.
[00:17:39.216 --> 00:17:44.198]  If you're going to launch a war as a king, you better be in the very front line with everybody trying to kill you.
[00:17:44.778 --> 00:17:51.984]  George Washington, at the head of his troops, his clothing shot up on a routine basis, protected by Providence.
[00:17:52.044 --> 00:17:53.486]  That is nobility.
[00:17:55.337 --> 00:18:11.542]  Nobility is being able to turn the other cheek when someone is weak and pathetic and in a bad position to teach them a lesson, but also knowing when to shut somebody down and crush them when they're a snake and consciously evil.
[00:18:12.342 --> 00:18:14.623]  Christ was the ultimate example of nobility.
[00:18:15.816 --> 00:18:25.563]  Turn the other cheek to the brethren but whip the money changers because they were consciously turned over to evil and fraud and defrauding the entire system and had taken over the house of the Lord.
[00:18:26.344 --> 00:18:27.745]  Had taken over God's house.
[00:18:28.766 --> 00:18:29.566]  Had defiled it.
[00:18:29.767 --> 00:18:32.829]  Had set themselves up before God as the idol.
[00:18:33.409 --> 00:18:34.610]  How many churches have done that?
[00:18:36.652 --> 00:18:40.735]  How many churches have turned the state and the worship of the state and the worship of
[00:18:42.392 --> 00:18:45.453]  Immature, degenerate, arbitrary power.
[00:18:46.253 --> 00:18:47.113]  Let's go another clip.
[00:18:47.153 --> 00:18:48.453]  Again, here's Dianne Feinstein.
[00:18:48.773 --> 00:18:52.634]  If she can get the votes, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn in all your semi-autos.
[00:18:52.854 --> 00:18:53.274]  Here it is.
[00:18:53.654 --> 00:19:07.477]  If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in, I would have done it.
[00:19:09.113 --> 00:19:09.794]  She would have done it.
[00:19:10.034 --> 00:19:13.897]  So Bill Maher says, hey, you have no Second Amendment, you have no right.
[00:19:13.917 --> 00:19:17.501]  Bob Costas gets all excited and starts clapping and agreeing.
[00:19:18.061 --> 00:19:20.183]  And these guys are crazed on these shows.
[00:19:20.504 --> 00:19:24.467]  They know they're willing accomplices for an authoritarian takeover.
[00:19:25.148 --> 00:19:32.074]  They've been told that they're going to be absolutely taken care of while they sit there in their big armored communities with armed bodyguards.
[00:19:32.114 --> 00:19:33.395]  They'll be able to keep their guns.
[00:19:34.598 --> 00:19:44.803]  And that they've been told, go along with this, you'll be taken care of, while the globalists consciously implode the economy to make us poor as a political tool of control.
[00:19:44.843 --> 00:19:51.406]  Now, there's new gun news coming up, and I talked about this Friday, I talked about it yesterday, it's so important.
[00:19:51.767 --> 00:19:58.210]  The video is up at DrugsReport.com on the left-hand side, next to the California flag.
[00:20:00.307 --> 00:20:03.829]  Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins.
[00:20:04.169 --> 00:20:04.889]  That bears repeating.
[00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:08.731]  Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins.
[00:20:09.092 --> 00:20:13.334]  And Pro-EM1 Daily Probiotic Cleanse is the key to digestive health.
[00:20:13.634 --> 00:20:19.117]  Pro-EM1 is a powerful liquid probiotic, strong enough to cleanse, gentle enough to use every day.
[00:20:19.497 --> 00:20:21.698]  Pro-EM1 is dairy, wheat, and soy free.
[00:20:21.958 --> 00:20:24.220]  Contains all natural and certified organic ingredients.
[00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:26.361]  Contains no preservatives or animal products.
[00:20:26.621 --> 00:20:28.562]  Supports a healthy digestive and immune system.
[00:20:28.702 --> 00:20:29.443]  Supports weight loss.
[00:20:29.723 --> 00:20:31.224]  Improves absorption of food nutrients.
[00:20:31.524 --> 00:20:32.925]  Aids in controlling yeast infections.
[00:20:33.185 --> 00:20:34.426]  Is never freeze-dried.
[00:20:34.766 --> 00:20:38.628]  And uses three groups of live, viable, beneficial microbes to cleanse and remove toxins.
[00:20:38.968 --> 00:20:42.412]  Order Pro-EM1 Daily Probiotic Cleanse at Terragonics.com.
[00:20:42.752 --> 00:20:46.376]  Spelled T-E-R-A-G-A-N-I-X dot com.
[00:20:46.656 --> 00:20:47.837]  Terragonics dot com.
[00:20:48.198 --> 00:20:49.018]  Or call toll free 866-369-3678.
[00:20:49.038 --> 00:20:49.479]  That's 866-369-3678.
[00:20:49.499 --> 00:20:50.380]  Pro-EM1, the raw probiotic.
[00:21:03.939 --> 00:21:05.600]  Curious about what comes next?
[00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:12.582]  Next is the feeling of vulnerability you get after you arrive home to discover your house has been ransacked by burglars.
[00:21:13.062 --> 00:21:16.103]  Fool the bad guys with a new improved fake TV.
[00:21:16.443 --> 00:21:22.705]  You asked for it, we listened, and we made our new fake TV three times brighter than our previous model.
[00:21:22.905 --> 00:21:26.266]  The brightness of our new fake TV is equivalent to a 40-inch TV.
[00:21:26.986 --> 00:21:31.789]  It simulates the color and motion of a real TV while you're away from home.
[00:21:32.309 --> 00:21:38.453]  And when burglars think someone is home watching television, they're likely to pass your house and move on to an easier target.
[00:21:38.793 --> 00:21:43.216]  The new Brighter Fake TV is only $39.95 and includes free shipping.
[00:21:43.596 --> 00:21:46.197]  Go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.
[00:21:49.119 --> 00:21:49.961]  That's 877-532-5388 or go to Faketv.com.
[00:21:49.981 --> 00:21:51.003]  Faketv, the burglar deterrent.
[00:21:59.386 --> 00:22:01.307]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[00:22:01.327 --> 00:22:03.248]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[00:22:03.469 --> 00:22:08.932]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[00:22:09.152 --> 00:22:12.914]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[00:22:13.175 --> 00:22:16.897]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[00:22:17.057 --> 00:22:18.258]  The fact is, you are.
[00:22:18.438 --> 00:22:19.218]  We all are.
[00:22:19.458 --> 00:22:21.780]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:30.386]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoods Direct.
[00:22:30.586 --> 00:22:31.787]  Be prepared before you need it.
[00:22:31.967 --> 00:22:35.150]  With nutrient-dense food you can store for up to 25 years.
[00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:37.651]  You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed you.
[00:22:37.791 --> 00:22:42.175]  Do what I've done and get your own supply of the best storable foods out there from eFoods Direct.
[00:22:42.315 --> 00:22:48.179]  Call 800-409-5633 or visit them on the web at eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:22:48.419 --> 00:22:49.840]  And check out their spring specials.
[00:22:50.081 --> 00:22:56.307]  Again, that number is 800-409-5633 or on the web at efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:22:56.547 --> 00:22:58.409]  You can bet your life on eFoodsDirect.
[00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:00.420]  Whew!
[00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:01.380]  Nice shootin'!
[00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:04.221]  Hey, that's a sweet AK-47 chest rig.
[00:23:04.261 --> 00:23:05.321]  Is that multi-cam?
[00:23:05.341 --> 00:23:05.561]  Yep!
[00:23:05.741 --> 00:23:07.862]  Got it from StrikeHardGear.com.
[00:23:08.042 --> 00:23:08.722]  Strike what?
[00:23:08.742 --> 00:23:12.543]  StrikeHardGear.com.
[00:23:12.683 --> 00:23:15.284]  Set your sights on StrikeHardGear.com.
[00:23:15.504 --> 00:23:19.465]  Tough, tactical gear for your Soviet-style weapon that's made in the USA.
[00:23:19.665 --> 00:23:24.866]  Affordable, plus a no-questions-asked 30-day money-back guarantee and lifetime replacement warranty.
[00:23:25.026 --> 00:23:26.487]  StrikeHardGear.com.
[00:23:26.667 --> 00:23:28.347]  Go ahead, pull the trigger.
[00:23:28.587 --> 00:23:37.853]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:23:37.913 --> 00:23:38.654]  This capitalism?
[00:23:38.714 --> 00:23:44.838]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:23:44.978 --> 00:23:45.738]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:23:45.779 --> 00:23:48.881]  I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[00:23:48.941 --> 00:23:49.861]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[00:23:49.881 --> 00:23:50.902]  It's time to understand the system.
[00:23:50.942 --> 00:23:51.542]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:23:51.582 --> 00:23:51.863]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:24:05.212 --> 00:24:10.196]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[00:24:10.516 --> 00:24:15.540]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:24:16.361 --> 00:24:18.422]  I'll be honest with you.
[00:24:20.384 --> 00:24:22.225]  I've analyzed the feeling I have.
[00:24:22.245 --> 00:24:27.109]  The overdriving feeling is sorrow.
[00:24:30.748 --> 00:24:39.552]  That America and the world is so decadent, so fallen, so childlike, so insecure, so immature.
[00:24:39.712 --> 00:24:50.837]  I people watch, and I watch their interactions at a movie, or at the park, or at the shopping mall, or paying bills, and I sit there
[00:24:52.388 --> 00:25:03.234]  And I see the general public just absolutely dumbed down and immature, and they have no idea what they're facing.
[00:25:04.854 --> 00:25:11.218]  And then those of us that are aware and awake and involved, we're the group being demonized.
[00:25:11.258 --> 00:25:13.319]  I mean, look at who Homeland Security demonizes.
[00:25:14.113 --> 00:25:15.796]  People that talk about a New World Order.
[00:25:16.157 --> 00:25:20.304]  People that talk about a New World Order global governance program.
[00:25:20.885 --> 00:25:22.047]  Returning veterans.
[00:25:22.588 --> 00:25:24.190]  Mainline Christians now.
[00:25:25.413 --> 00:25:27.934]  Next to the Ku Klux Klan and Al Qaeda.
[00:25:28.334 --> 00:25:29.755]  The Army's being taught it.
[00:25:30.435 --> 00:25:32.736]  I talked about this yesterday and showed the news articles.
[00:25:32.756 --> 00:25:39.978]  I'm going to do a special report this week where even the state police of Colorado have gone public going and sheriffs have gone public going.
[00:25:40.098 --> 00:25:45.280]  The new federal training asks if we're ready to confiscate guns from Christians.
[00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:48.721]  I mean, they're training for war with us!
[00:25:49.341 --> 00:25:51.202]  I mean, it's happening!
[00:25:51.882 --> 00:25:54.003]  And it's all over the top
[00:25:55.877 --> 00:25:58.980]  And now I don't even have the instinct to believe the United States.
[00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:00.862]  I mean, I realize it's a worldwide tyranny.
[00:26:01.222 --> 00:26:03.784]  A lot of people hear this and get scared and decide to just say nothing.
[00:26:03.824 --> 00:26:05.046]  Maybe they'll pass you over.
[00:26:06.167 --> 00:26:14.134]  The angel of death is not going to pass over your house, ladies and gentlemen, until you publicly say where you stand and publicly say you stand against the enemy.
[00:26:15.427 --> 00:26:20.191]  Going along with this is not going to have the evil pass over you.
[00:26:20.211 --> 00:26:21.992]  It's going to have it come to your doorstep.
[00:26:22.573 --> 00:26:26.196]  And I just cannot impress upon you... I'll tell you what else makes me sick.
[00:26:26.256 --> 00:26:32.941]  All the infighting by so-called libertarian and conservative talk show hosts who then attack people and then people even respond back.
[00:26:33.622 --> 00:26:33.982]  You know what?
[00:26:34.122 --> 00:26:35.944]  I'm even wrong to have responded back.
[00:26:36.044 --> 00:26:38.986]  And I say this and then he does new stuff and I get mad at him.
[00:26:39.286 --> 00:26:40.748]  But things are too serious.
[00:26:41.809 --> 00:26:43.830]  And I usually can do what I say I'm going to do.
[00:26:43.870 --> 00:26:46.392]  Like I've said before, I'm not going to respond back to Glenn Beck.
[00:26:48.093 --> 00:26:59.261]  I may respond if he does stuff again, but I'm going to be gentlemanly about it, and I am putting out olive branches to all my so-called enemies, even though a lot of them I know are evil people who wouldn't take an olive branch.
[00:27:00.082 --> 00:27:02.844]  I'm still spiritually forgiving everyone.
[00:27:03.464 --> 00:27:05.866]  Because a lot of people get jealous when you're in this position.
[00:27:05.886 --> 00:27:07.147]  A lot of people act weird.
[00:27:07.448 --> 00:27:10.550]  You can always one-up yourself by putting down somebody.
[00:27:11.011 --> 00:27:12.232]  It's all Cass Sunstein.
[00:27:12.272 --> 00:27:13.393]  Cognitive infiltration.
[00:27:13.413 --> 00:27:16.736]  The White House said four years ago they would infiltrate alternative media.
[00:27:17.036 --> 00:27:18.538]  Try to get us to end fight with each other.
[00:27:19.018 --> 00:27:21.620]  Ladies and gentlemen, we need to unify together.
[00:27:21.981 --> 00:27:23.662]  Defending the Second Amendment.
[00:27:24.103 --> 00:27:26.365]  Defending the sanctity of life.
[00:27:26.685 --> 00:27:29.588]  By the way, we're on the march reversing abortion.
[00:27:30.543 --> 00:27:35.605]  Because polls show, the large index of polls, people swung against abortion.
[00:27:37.086 --> 00:27:38.946]  The people have swung against GMO.
[00:27:39.566 --> 00:27:44.268]  They have swung against, so it's not about left right now, it's about right and wrong.
[00:27:44.668 --> 00:27:46.409]  People are swinging pro-gun.
[00:27:47.269 --> 00:27:48.130]  All the numbers show.
[00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:56.293]  That's why the collectivists who are in control, gutting our economy, gutting our future, signing us on to trillions of dollars of debt that aren't ours,
[00:27:58.217 --> 00:28:05.080]  Selling our infrastructure out for nothing to China, giving them all our deep-water ports in this hemisphere, as part of a globalist deal.
[00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:16.745]  Just like Hitler and Stalin divided Poland, America has been divided between the EU mega-banks, the British banks, the Federal Reserve banks that are globalist-owned, foreign, and China.
[00:28:17.085 --> 00:28:18.046]  It's already happened.
[00:28:18.066 --> 00:28:19.226]  The deal was already made.
[00:28:20.147 --> 00:28:22.368]  That's why they gave them Panama Canal in 2000.
[00:28:24.096 --> 00:28:29.020]  That's why they've given them all the deepwater ports on the West Coast, from Seattle to Long Beach.
[00:28:30.941 --> 00:28:36.306]  And when you've studied history, I don't just say I get chills, folks.
[00:28:36.926 --> 00:28:38.287]  I can hardly do this radio show.
[00:28:39.428 --> 00:28:43.731]  Because even doing this radio show is just like everything's business as usual.
[00:28:44.132 --> 00:28:45.613]  It's not business as usual.
[00:28:50.957 --> 00:28:52.879]  I just am so worried about my children.
[00:28:53.618 --> 00:28:59.079]  I watched my five-year-old daughter go off to dance class this morning with my mother, who took her.
[00:28:59.499 --> 00:29:04.581]  My mother's innocent, even though she's a very smart person who knows history, is a history-obsessed buff.
[00:29:08.241 --> 00:29:10.302]  What is my mother supposed to do to fight the New World Order?
[00:29:10.722 --> 00:29:12.502]  What's my five-year-old daughter supposed to do?
[00:29:13.303 --> 00:29:13.983]  I'm the man.
[00:29:14.263 --> 00:29:18.684]  I'm supposed to do something about this, and I don't know what to do!
[00:29:19.810 --> 00:29:22.751]  Because you got crazy criminals running wild.
[00:29:23.191 --> 00:29:34.035]  You can go out in Austin, Texas or San Diego, California and every person you talk to in trendy areas says, put all gun owners in forced labor camps, ban water.
[00:29:34.315 --> 00:29:43.078]  I mean, they're just a sick cult of sick freaks who are not connected to history or reality and have no idea what they're going to do to everybody.
[00:29:44.238 --> 00:29:44.539]  OK?
[00:29:44.599 --> 00:29:44.799]  I mean...
[00:29:46.369 --> 00:29:46.831]  Oh, man.
[00:29:47.572 --> 00:29:48.093]  We'll be back.
[00:29:48.114 --> 00:29:48.595]  Stay with us.
[00:29:49.256 --> 00:29:50.158]  We're on the march.
[00:29:50.659 --> 00:29:52.263]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.205 --> 00:29:55.872]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.006 --> 00:30:09.673]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal Ben Soap Company.
[00:30:10.113 --> 00:30:13.736]  Alex and his staff have used these pure soap products for years.

[00:30:40.696 --> 00:30:42.337]  This is an amazing deal.
[00:30:42.677 --> 00:30:47.300]  You can save thousands of dollars and you will love the way real soap makes you feel.
[00:30:47.921 --> 00:30:51.063]  See them on the web at 5starsoap.com or call

[00:31:00.222 --> 00:31:03.285]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms.
[00:31:03.625 --> 00:31:09.090]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[00:31:09.671 --> 00:31:12.874]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?
[00:31:13.554 --> 00:31:14.815]  Check out SimpliSafe.

[00:31:56.859 --> 00:31:59.020]  Again, that's GetSimplySafe.com
[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:01.601]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[00:32:01.621 --> 00:32:03.882]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[00:32:04.042 --> 00:32:09.285]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[00:32:09.505 --> 00:32:13.287]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[00:32:13.547 --> 00:32:17.309]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[00:32:17.489 --> 00:32:18.670]  The fact is, you are.
[00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:19.651]  We all are.
[00:32:19.891 --> 00:32:22.212]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[00:32:22.532 --> 00:32:30.899]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoodsDirect.
[00:32:31.099 --> 00:32:32.300]  Be prepared before you need it.

[00:32:35.943 --> 00:32:38.205]  You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed you.
[00:32:38.345 --> 00:32:42.768]  Do what I've done and get your own supply of the best storable foods out there from eFoodsDirect.
[00:32:42.908 --> 00:32:48.793]  Call 800-409-5633 or visit them on the web at efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:32:49.033 --> 00:32:49.913]  We are on the march.
[00:32:49.953 --> 00:32:51.314]  The empire is on the run.
[00:32:51.334 --> 00:32:52.475]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:32:52.495 --> 00:32:53.335]  We are on the march.
[00:33:18.103 --> 00:33:20.384]  The Empire is on the run.
[00:33:20.984 --> 00:33:26.945]  But that's why their counter-offensive is in high gear.
[00:33:28.205 --> 00:33:45.009]  And again, top globalists from Rothkopf to Kissinger to Zbigniew Brzezinski, all of them have put out different white papers discussing the fact, on record, you can just
[00:33:46.270 --> 00:33:48.832]  Go to YouTube and type in Brzezinski says a leader in trouble.
[00:33:49.192 --> 00:33:51.254]  Brzezinski says the whole world is waking up.
[00:33:52.014 --> 00:33:53.435]  It's all there on record.
[00:33:54.396 --> 00:33:58.138]  But still, they're in control of our currencies worldwide.
[00:33:58.659 --> 00:34:00.700]  They're mopping up the few countries they don't control.
[00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:12.208]  And they are butchering the value of the people's pensions, the people's investments, the infrastructure.
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:16.681]  Because it's not enough to control the fiat issuance of currency and credit.
[00:34:18.142 --> 00:34:21.103]  The technocrats want to make you poor to control you.
[00:34:21.283 --> 00:34:23.224]  And that's really their greatest crime.
[00:34:23.984 --> 00:34:30.386]  And then they argue, well, people having plenty of food and water and entertainment and shelter, that makes them decadent.
[00:34:30.846 --> 00:34:32.247]  And so we're going to take that away.
[00:34:32.747 --> 00:34:33.887]  Austerity is beautiful.
[00:34:34.387 --> 00:34:36.048]  And of course there's a grain of truth there.
[00:34:37.068 --> 00:34:40.270]  That prosperity makes monsters.
[00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:41.290]  Adversity makes men.
[00:34:42.754 --> 00:34:45.020]  I flipped what Victor Hugo said, or out of order.
[00:34:45.442 --> 00:34:48.991]  He said, uh, adversity makes men, prosperity makes monsters.
[00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:55.435]  But the globalists have geared the educational system to dumb people down on record.
[00:34:55.655 --> 00:34:56.596]  That's declassified.
[00:34:57.516 --> 00:35:00.399]  Covered in the book, Deliberate Dumbing Down, with the internal documents.
[00:35:00.719 --> 00:35:02.941]  Charlotte is the Rehead of Policy, Department of Education.
[00:35:03.782 --> 00:35:08.906]  It's on record they want to dumb down self-centered, really evil population.
[00:35:08.966 --> 00:35:13.290]  I mean, I don't really pay attention to pop culture, but I've been forced to.
[00:35:14.031 --> 00:35:16.933]  And the stuff targeting tweenie and preteen girls,
[00:35:18.184 --> 00:35:27.490]  8, 9, 10, 11-year-olds that I hear booming out of cars and that I see children listening to on their iPads and iPods.
[00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:33.593]  All of it is sexualizing them and hardcore devil worship.
[00:35:37.576 --> 00:35:42.779]  And I'm not just talking about Lady Gaga, but Kesha, Jay-Z, all of it.
[00:35:44.634 --> 00:36:03.389]  Again, the guys were showing me this weekend some of the Kesha videos where they're teaching young girls how to commit suicide and how beautiful it is to be married to the devil and how great it is to kill yourself and we wonder why kids are killing themselves and little girls are epidemic cutting themselves and it shows that.
[00:36:03.409 --> 00:36:05.191]  In fact, I don't even want to look at it.
[00:36:05.211 --> 00:36:06.171]  Take it down off the screen.
[00:36:06.712 --> 00:36:09.794]  And of course, I can't imagine how cursed Kesha will be.
[00:36:10.991 --> 00:36:11.812]  Not by God.
[00:36:11.892 --> 00:36:14.754]  I mean, when you get into evil, it will destroy you.
[00:36:15.514 --> 00:36:18.336]  I shiver just watching this.
[00:36:18.936 --> 00:36:28.863]  Folks, when societies do this, there's always giant wars, everything collapses, and large portions of the population are killed.
[00:36:29.623 --> 00:36:30.964]  I mean, this is like clockwork.
[00:36:31.404 --> 00:36:35.127]  This is like the oven dinging when it's gotten up to temperature.
[00:36:40.728 --> 00:36:46.714]  This is... I know I'm just ranting and preaching here.
[00:36:46.754 --> 00:36:48.215]  I've got so much news to get to.
[00:36:49.456 --> 00:37:05.291]  When we can go out on the streets of Austin and every person we talk to, every person, we say, hey, let's ban dihydrogen monoxide to save the earth, and they just mindlessly sign it when that's H2O.
[00:37:11.385 --> 00:37:18.188]  And then people on InfoWars.com, the so-called liberals, the authoritarian brainwashed government cult people...
[00:37:19.383 --> 00:37:20.143]  The state cult.
[00:37:20.603 --> 00:37:25.644]  They're in there arguing that hydrogen monoxide is not water with straight faces, and they're doing it on YouTube.
[00:37:25.664 --> 00:37:32.085]  Because see, in the new world, you don't argue with our facts, you just make your own facts.
[00:37:32.766 --> 00:37:39.107]  Like O'Brien tells Winston when he's torturing him in 1984, he goes, Winston, 2 plus 2 equals 4?
[00:37:39.367 --> 00:37:40.927]  You say that's proof of freedom?
[00:37:41.367 --> 00:37:45.108]  I'm going to torture you until you'll believe it's whatever I say it is.
[00:37:45.948 --> 00:37:52.910]  Don't you know we could suspend gravity with our mathematicians, but also still have gravity for our ships and aircraft to navigate?
[00:37:55.151 --> 00:38:02.054]  And have our captains and pilots believe that there's no gravity while they use gravity in their computations?
[00:38:04.494 --> 00:38:05.435]  And that's exactly it.
[00:38:05.555 --> 00:38:13.678]  They are now arguing dihydrogen monoxide is not water, instead of admitting that all these university trendies and
[00:38:15.373 --> 00:38:23.263]  You know, physics graduates and chemist graduates don't know what dihydrogen monoxide is.
[00:38:25.986 --> 00:38:28.629]  I mean, we've reached that level now where you can go.
[00:38:31.118 --> 00:38:32.298]  Because I talked to Mark Dice.
[00:38:32.358 --> 00:38:35.999]  I mean, he went out and talked to people and that's what he ran into.
[00:38:36.019 --> 00:38:42.440]  The video's up on DrugsReport.com on the left-hand side underneath the California flag of the bear in distress.
[00:38:43.461 --> 00:38:49.822]  And you watch it and every person, except for two young women who were obviously sisters, they say, I don't want to turn my guns in.
[00:38:49.902 --> 00:38:50.462]  I own guns.
[00:38:51.442 --> 00:38:54.263]  Everyone else, he said, you know, we're going to
[00:38:55.367 --> 00:38:56.307]  We're going to play it in a moment.
[00:38:56.808 --> 00:39:02.250]  We're going to go and arrest the evil white Tea Party people and take their guns.
[00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:08.092]  And by the way, I'm going to send my reporters out to go one step further and say, you know what?
[00:39:08.132 --> 00:39:09.753]  These people haven't paid their fair share.
[00:39:10.313 --> 00:39:13.555]  Let's have 100% taxes on them and put them in forced labor camps.
[00:39:14.095 --> 00:39:20.498]  And I guarantee you, I will find people at the University of Texas ready to put you in a forced labor camp.
[00:39:21.098 --> 00:39:28.526]  Because to them, they go watch zombie movies and death all day because it thrills them because they've never been in even a fistfight or a car wreck.
[00:39:28.967 --> 00:39:33.452]  Or they've never sat there and watched somebody in a car wreck with their throat slit and blood spraying all over them.
[00:39:33.612 --> 00:39:34.713]  They've never been in the real thing.
[00:39:34.953 --> 00:39:36.635]  They all live completely sheltered lives.
[00:39:36.955 --> 00:39:40.139]  And it just sounds powerful to put us in a forced labor camp.
[00:39:43.012 --> 00:39:58.645]  Do you understand these are sick freaks who would have gotten on their knees to any of history's tyrants and done whatever they said because deep down they're so cowardly, deep down they're so scared, deep down they are so freaked out by evil that they run to it begging.
[00:39:58.665 --> 00:40:05.771]  See the ultimate coward is delusional and they decide to embrace this garbage.
[00:40:07.025 --> 00:40:12.147]  Let's go ahead and play an excerpt of the video that Unprecedented, Drudge, knows it's so important.
[00:40:12.187 --> 00:40:12.987]  We appreciate that.
[00:40:13.547 --> 00:40:14.448]  That's why I went with it.
[00:40:15.088 --> 00:40:18.089]  Even though Mark Dice has been a critic of me, I don't even care.
[00:40:18.349 --> 00:40:19.529]  This video needs to be seen.
[00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:22.290]  See, I'm totally becoming free now.
[00:40:22.571 --> 00:40:23.911]  I just don't even care.
[00:40:24.091 --> 00:40:25.091]  I don't care if they arrest me.
[00:40:25.332 --> 00:40:26.652]  I don't care if I get killed.
[00:40:26.952 --> 00:40:30.373]  I don't care if people lie about me, twist things.
[00:40:30.473 --> 00:40:31.374]  I don't care anymore.
[00:40:31.934 --> 00:40:34.315]  Because I understand the mega massive evil
[00:40:35.595 --> 00:40:35.655]  I'm
[00:40:55.189 --> 00:41:12.149]  The Federal Reserve shareholders that openly say that they're funding all the anti-gun, anti-family, globalist organizations who are wanting 80% or higher tax rates on you and your family to transfer your money to them, not to just become rich, but to bankrupt you!
[00:41:13.170 --> 00:41:19.773]  I stand for prosperity, and I stand for liberty, and I stand for being honest and decent and telling the truth.
[00:41:19.973 --> 00:41:24.774]  And I call for everyone else who loves liberty to have your voice be heard today.
[00:41:24.814 --> 00:41:27.755]  And I said this yesterday on the Sunday Show, and I'm going to say it again.
[00:41:29.056 --> 00:41:39.740]  If you are a talk show host, or web person, or journalist, or preacher, or police officer, or counselor, or medical doctor, a person of influence,
[00:41:42.245 --> 00:41:43.626]  Federal Reserve employee.
[00:41:47.089 --> 00:41:54.616]  My great uncle was pretty high up in the Dallas Federal Reserve and came to know it was all evil and bad before he died listening to me on the radio in Dallas.
[00:41:55.617 --> 00:41:56.178]  Uncle Billy.
[00:41:57.279 --> 00:41:57.859]  Great guy.
[00:41:57.899 --> 00:41:58.860]  Great World War II vet.
[00:41:58.880 --> 00:41:59.881]  Just amazing person.
[00:42:00.281 --> 00:42:01.182]  My grandmother's brother.
[00:42:01.222 --> 00:42:01.943]  She's still alive.
[00:42:03.564 --> 00:42:08.529]  My whole issue is, ladies and gentlemen, for everybody out there,
[00:42:11.578 --> 00:42:19.060]  For everybody out there, what I'm asking you, what I'm begging you to do is to realize you've been taught going along is what gets you there.
[00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:26.301]  No, no, it was going along that got us into this position and got us leveraged into debt that's not ours to make us bondage slaves.
[00:42:26.801 --> 00:42:27.522]  Bond slaves.
[00:42:30.842 --> 00:42:32.983]  That's what a bond slave is, your bond.
[00:42:33.942 --> 00:42:35.783]  Because your family sold you.
[00:42:36.383 --> 00:42:42.107]  You could come from a free family in the Middle East, read the Bible, and your family could sell you as a bond slave.
[00:42:42.687 --> 00:42:49.731]  Just 200 years ago, before they began abolishing it, and they didn't abolish it in Germany until about 160 years ago, is when they finally phased it out.
[00:42:50.091 --> 00:42:50.871]  Bond slave.
[00:42:51.112 --> 00:42:57.075]  Your parents could take you, even from a good family, and could sell you as an indentured slave.
[00:42:58.442 --> 00:43:12.594]  But she'll never be talked at in the media, because they want blacks to have an inferiority complex, and to be racist, and to hate all white people, to not even know that Germany didn't abolish all of its slavery until the 1880s.
[00:43:13.995 --> 00:43:15.356]  White slaves!
[00:43:17.298 --> 00:43:21.241]  It wasn't even Germany yet, it got unified right around that time.
[00:43:22.253 --> 00:43:24.414]  Germania, Austrian-Hungarian Empire.
[00:43:24.774 --> 00:43:28.576]  The point is, is that I want a future.
[00:43:29.417 --> 00:43:31.018]  And I'm sick of watching them.
[00:43:31.298 --> 00:43:37.261]  I tell you, even though it's interesting, have you ever watched Big Fish hunt Little Fish, and you see them eating
[00:43:37.261 --> 00:43:37.761]  We're good to go.
[00:44:02.341 --> 00:44:07.185]  I feel, and it's not because I'm a hero or a good guy.
[00:44:07.485 --> 00:44:10.127]  It's a normal response of empathy.
[00:44:11.768 --> 00:44:12.188]  There it is.
[00:44:12.228 --> 00:44:14.690]  Debtor's prison legal in more than one-third of U.S.
[00:44:14.710 --> 00:44:15.130]  states.
[00:44:16.471 --> 00:44:18.593]  And by the way, that's totally unconstitutional.
[00:44:19.815 --> 00:44:26.819]  Eddie Craig did a two and a half hour presentation that's at PrisonPlanet.tv on all of this.
[00:44:27.119 --> 00:44:28.599]  Bills of attainer, all of it.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.761]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, America is not a free country anymore.
[00:44:32.942 --> 00:44:35.463]  There's islands of free media left, barely.
[00:44:35.783 --> 00:44:37.604]  The White House is openly going after them.
[00:44:39.219 --> 00:44:42.942]  And again, a lot of you are going to think, yeah, Alex, we actually know it's tyranny.
[00:44:43.182 --> 00:44:47.145]  We're going to shut up and we will run and we will live.
[00:44:47.485 --> 00:44:48.546]  Yes, for at least a while.
[00:44:49.106 --> 00:44:59.453]  But many years from now, lying in your beds, what would you do to just once come back here and tell our enemies, you can take our lives, but you'll never take our freedom.
[00:45:00.234 --> 00:45:00.734]  And you know what?
[00:45:00.794 --> 00:45:01.935]  William Wallace lost.
[00:45:03.786 --> 00:45:05.868]  He won a few battles but then was killed by treachery.
[00:45:05.928 --> 00:45:07.010]  That's a historical fact.
[00:45:07.050 --> 00:45:10.033]  That's a real story, folks.
[00:45:10.914 --> 00:45:14.558]  But right after he was killed, Scotland got its independence.
[00:45:19.795 --> 00:45:21.855]  And so, and then of course it was another battle.
[00:45:22.656 --> 00:45:31.538]  The imperial system, the Viking system, the Norman system that had conquered England, was able to conquer them again.
[00:45:31.898 --> 00:45:33.778]  But the whole point is it's an eternal struggle.
[00:45:35.259 --> 00:45:36.739]  And it's the same thing over and over again.
[00:45:37.139 --> 00:45:40.960]  Your children, let me explain this, are already having GMO fed to them.
[00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:44.421]  They're already pushing vaccines, trying to make them mandatory worldwide.
[00:45:45.621 --> 00:45:48.882]  By fraud, already making them mandatory, lying and saying it's mandatory.
[00:45:49.833 --> 00:45:54.857]  We're already in a criminal society because people keep saying yes, yes, yes, yes, yes to tyranny.
[00:45:56.519 --> 00:46:00.983]  And your children are walking dead, many of them already.
[00:46:02.604 --> 00:46:08.469]  They've done all this in rodent studies with guinea pigs, rats, mice, you name it.
[00:46:08.489 --> 00:46:09.830]  We sell books that cover it.
[00:46:10.611 --> 00:46:11.592]  We break it all down.
[00:46:16.716 --> 00:46:20.717]  In-game blueprint for global enslavement, in the genetic roulette books we sell, all of it.
[00:46:23.358 --> 00:46:27.539]  We're now going into the second generation of real soft kill.
[00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:33.681]  And you can already see the cancer rates, the way that people look, the health problems, all of it.
[00:46:33.921 --> 00:46:36.962]  What happens to the rats fed the GMO across the board?
[00:46:38.063 --> 00:46:40.143]  It's because it's designed to do it, every one of the crops.
[00:46:41.083 --> 00:46:42.644]  It's not like it's an accident it does it.
[00:46:44.002 --> 00:46:53.026]  There's a reason the Monsanto laboratories, you know, for 15 years, all of their scientists refused to eat GMO and have it trucked in to their cafeterias non-GMO.
[00:46:53.386 --> 00:46:56.587]  There's a reason all the ruling class won't eat GMO on record.
[00:46:57.187 --> 00:46:57.808]  Just look it up.
[00:46:58.128 --> 00:47:00.589]  Chinese communists have secret gardens non-GMO.
[00:47:01.249 --> 00:47:03.510]  British royalty have secret gardens non-GMO.
[00:47:04.370 --> 00:47:06.331]  Rich elite will not even touch it.
[00:47:06.871 --> 00:47:11.413]  Because, I mean, would they grab a cobra out of the bushes and slap it on their arm?
[00:47:11.453 --> 00:47:12.794]  I mean, of course you wouldn't.
[00:47:13.615 --> 00:47:15.217]  But we're brought up in it so we don't know.
[00:47:15.797 --> 00:47:24.446]  First generation, the guinea pigs begun to be obese, lower IQs, smaller genitals, lower sperm counts.
[00:47:24.506 --> 00:47:32.214]  By second generation, off the chart cancer, obesity, deformity of the organs, almost complete infertility.
[00:47:32.274 --> 00:47:34.416]  Third generation, I show guinea pigs
[00:47:36.478 --> 00:47:40.182]  Just type in guinea pigs, hair on tongues.
[00:47:40.222 --> 00:47:42.164]  That'll pull up the studies and photos.
[00:47:42.605 --> 00:47:47.790]  Hair on the tongues, 99.9% sterility, tumors growing all over them.
[00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:52.535]  I mean, the wages of the new world order is death.
[00:47:54.181 --> 00:48:03.025]  And you go out to California, where they're getting hit by the radiation clouds, where they're under the GMO, where all this is happening, ladies and gentlemen, and you go out to L.A.
[00:48:03.105 --> 00:48:12.709]  or San Diego or Malibu Beach, and you say to people, let's arrest all the gun owners, and you can even throw in, let's put them in a forced labor camp, and everyone
[00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:18.263]  90% of the people will sign it and they get excited.
[00:48:18.743 --> 00:48:19.083]  Yeah!
[00:48:19.103 --> 00:48:21.044]  You don't have to tell me, buddy.
[00:48:21.905 --> 00:48:26.008]  Because this, to them, is just they're fantasizing about darkness.
[00:48:26.688 --> 00:48:28.830]  They're fantasizing about sexy power.
[00:48:29.250 --> 00:48:31.892]  Let's go ahead and go to a clip of Californians.
[00:48:33.171 --> 00:48:36.995]  He's like, yeah, the evil whites, Tea Party, we need to arrest them, take their guns.
[00:48:37.475 --> 00:48:39.277]  You don't have to tell me, buddy.
[00:48:39.697 --> 00:48:41.119]  And he says he signs with pleasure.
[00:48:41.819 --> 00:48:42.760]  Like, you don't have to tell me.
[00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:49.407]  And again, the reason this is such a genius video is if you all go out and do this and talk with the same, you gotta shuffle when you walk up.
[00:48:49.907 --> 00:48:51.488]  You've got to go, uhhhh.
[00:48:52.028 --> 00:48:52.488]  I'm serious.
[00:48:52.528 --> 00:48:53.309]  It's a cult thing.
[00:48:53.349 --> 00:48:55.150]  The government cult talks like NPR.
[00:48:55.170 --> 00:48:55.870]  They're in a trance.
[00:48:56.190 --> 00:49:00.112]  You've got to go, arrest the whites, take their guns, FEMA camp.
[00:49:00.532 --> 00:49:12.118]  They will get excited and they'll do the same little head bob with you and look at you in personal self-disgust of each other and then go, yeah, let's do it, because it's decadent and slimy to desecrate freedom.
[00:49:12.358 --> 00:49:15.360]  And they'll go, yeah, let's arrest the gun owners.
[00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:16.140]  Yeah, let's do it.
[00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:17.281]  We're sick freaks.
[00:49:17.341 --> 00:49:17.761]  Let's do it.
[00:49:17.981 --> 00:49:18.922]  Let's go ahead and go back to the tape.
[00:49:18.962 --> 00:49:19.282]  Here it is.
[00:49:19.562 --> 00:49:20.983]  Just a name and a signature.
[00:49:21.003 --> 00:49:31.492]  We're trying to just repeal the Second Amendment to make sure that only the criminals have the guns and get them out of the hands of the law-abiding citizens.
[00:49:31.752 --> 00:49:33.574]  To repeal the Second Amendment.
[00:49:33.634 --> 00:49:36.276]  It's such an old-fashioned amendment.
[00:49:36.416 --> 00:49:42.361]  We're just making sure that the law-abiding gun owners have that right taken away.
[00:49:42.841 --> 00:49:43.642]  Thank you so much.
[00:49:45.231 --> 00:49:48.032]  We're going to repeal the Second Amendment.
[00:49:48.612 --> 00:49:51.173]  Only the police and the military need to have guns.
[00:49:51.233 --> 00:49:52.474]  We can trust them.
[00:49:52.814 --> 00:49:55.675]  They've never done anything wrong.
[00:49:56.155 --> 00:50:01.297]  And we're just going to get the legal registered guns off the street.
[00:50:01.317 --> 00:50:03.138]  You don't have to convince us, my friend.
[00:50:03.318 --> 00:50:09.660]  This will remove all the law-abiding registered gun owners and then the criminal sign.
[00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:16.683]  The criminals won't turn their guns in, so they'll still have their guns after we repeal the Second Amendment.
[00:50:17.464 --> 00:50:18.604]  Thanks for supporting that.
[00:50:19.745 --> 00:50:20.405]  Come on, bro.
[00:50:20.445 --> 00:50:23.687]  You don't want the kids to die in another massacre like Sandy Hook, do you?
[00:50:23.747 --> 00:50:26.608]  No, no, but I... I just... Come on, bro.
[00:50:26.628 --> 00:50:27.869]  I don't feel like saying anything right now.
[00:50:27.909 --> 00:50:28.269]  I'm sorry.
[00:50:28.729 --> 00:50:30.470]  We're going to repeal the Second Amendment.
[00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:31.971]  All right, that's good.
[00:50:31.991 --> 00:50:35.573]  Full video up at DrudgeReport.com.
[00:50:35.773 --> 00:50:37.314]  Left hand, shied.
[00:50:38.394 --> 00:50:43.198]  Right there, on Drudge Report, Californians signed petition to ban and confiscate firearms.
[00:50:43.718 --> 00:50:47.761]  And the new news that's out, Big Sis coordinating gun confiscations.
[00:50:47.901 --> 00:50:48.542]  It's official.
[00:50:48.902 --> 00:50:56.407]  She's the one directing state police everywhere to illegally take veterans' guns without even a psychological adjudication that they're mentally ill.
[00:50:57.228 --> 00:50:58.309]  The kidnapping of veterans.
[00:51:01.428 --> 00:51:03.050]  Time and time again.
[00:51:03.070 --> 00:51:05.854]  You need to come here and help us.
[00:51:05.954 --> 00:51:07.056]  We need assistance.
[00:51:07.416 --> 00:51:07.957]  Please!
[00:51:08.217 --> 00:51:11.542]  Those we should be able to depend on let us down.
[00:51:11.822 --> 00:51:15.187]  Federal and state and local officials saying help is on the way.
[00:51:15.507 --> 00:51:17.911]  While the folks here in Bell Harbor say show me.
[00:51:18.191 --> 00:51:20.512]  Don't depend on the government to save you.

[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:23.706]  By, uh, by repealing the Second Amendment, what that'll do is we'll have a door-to-door gun confiscation against the white people, the right-wing extremists.
[00:54:23.906 --> 00:54:24.227]  Okay.
[00:54:24.267 --> 00:54:25.287]  Take away their guns.
[00:54:25.467 --> 00:54:26.088]  What birthday?
[00:54:26.168 --> 00:54:27.589]  What's the, what's the... Oh, my birthday.
[00:54:27.609 --> 00:54:28.589]  Yeah, your birthday, yeah.
[00:54:28.629 --> 00:54:36.995]  Just repealing the Second Amendment, door-to-door gun confiscations, then that way only the unregistered guns will be out, and it'll be, we'll be much safer that way.
[00:54:37.015 --> 00:54:37.235]  Got you.
[00:54:37.495 --> 00:54:38.136]  I'll believe that, man.
[00:54:38.176 --> 00:54:39.116]  Thank you for supporting that.
[00:54:39.136 --> 00:54:39.737]  No doubt, no doubt.
[00:54:40.876 --> 00:54:42.277]  Alright, that's enough.
[00:54:42.977 --> 00:54:44.358]  Again, get this video.
[00:54:44.418 --> 00:54:46.040]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:53.565]  But the easiest place to find it is DrugsReport.com on the left hand side.
[00:54:53.645 --> 00:54:57.867]  You see a big old California, Republican California flag.
[00:54:57.988 --> 00:54:58.468]  America.
[00:54:58.508 --> 00:55:04.552]  Californians moved to ban, seize guns, carry foreign students scared of guns in the U.S.
[00:55:04.572 --> 00:55:05.673]  We're going to go to that in a moment.
[00:55:06.133 --> 00:55:08.415]  Senator, background checks amount to new tax.
[00:55:09.716 --> 00:55:10.937]  Oh yeah, that's the plan.
[00:55:11.518 --> 00:55:16.464]  Riffs in both parties complicate odds for Bill developing, but they'll get it after the next stage suiting.
[00:55:16.885 --> 00:55:21.631]  Nanny Bloomberg, if you sell a gun to your son, something's wrong in your family.
[00:55:22.512 --> 00:55:26.417]  This is a guy who has bodyguards, owns guns, owns jet copters.
[00:55:28.436 --> 00:55:29.736]  I mean, he's just a total predator.
[00:55:30.497 --> 00:55:32.717]  There was an article he was interviewed, where he said, I'm a technocrat.
[00:55:32.737 --> 00:55:34.538]  I love knowing everything about you and tracking it.
[00:55:34.858 --> 00:55:35.838]  I'll plan your life.
[00:55:36.118 --> 00:55:37.678]  No, you won't, you sick freak!
[00:55:38.158 --> 00:55:38.959]  You sicko!
[00:55:42.339 --> 00:55:48.121]  Critics question use of new NSA data center, working with Facebook, with attorney generals.
[00:55:48.161 --> 00:55:49.501]  They're just spying on everything.
[00:55:51.602 --> 00:55:52.862]  And the collapse is beginning.
[00:55:53.122 --> 00:55:56.643]  State buses hundreds of mentally ill patients to cities around the country.
[00:55:59.211 --> 00:56:12.621]  And again, ladies and gentlemen, what you've got to do is you've got to go out to areas in your community and go to these anti-gun rallies.
[00:56:13.042 --> 00:56:15.123]  And ladies and gentlemen, shoot video.
[00:56:15.143 --> 00:56:17.285]  Go up and say, hi, I'm a communist.
[00:56:17.345 --> 00:56:19.306]  I want to arrest all gun owners.
[00:56:19.667 --> 00:56:25.091]  And the people will say to you, especially if you have a hidden camera, they'll go, yes, my brother, soon is the time.
[00:56:26.175 --> 00:56:28.156]  And I've been telling my reporters for months this is what I want to do.
[00:56:28.236 --> 00:56:28.956]  We're going to do it.
[00:56:30.016 --> 00:56:34.237]  I mean, we already sent reporters out and they said, here in Austin, once we register the guns, we're going to take them.
[00:56:34.637 --> 00:56:39.959]  And you've got to go and show people this is a cult of freak weirdos who just are in love with tyranny.
[00:56:40.359 --> 00:56:43.340]  Because they're so weak individually, they get off on this idea.
[00:56:43.380 --> 00:56:49.802]  But just go to gun rallies and go, soon, my brother, we will have the communism and we will arrest our enemies and put them in FEMA centers.
[00:56:50.202 --> 00:56:51.702]  And they're like, oh, yes, my brother.
[00:56:51.722 --> 00:56:53.082]  Because I've been to some of these things.
[00:56:53.303 --> 00:56:54.363]  I've been around these people.
[00:56:55.023 --> 00:56:55.864]  You think I'm joking?
[00:56:55.924 --> 00:57:01.890]  I have footage of them, communists in New York, saying we're going to put all the gun owners in Stalin camps.
[00:57:02.350 --> 00:57:03.792]  And I said, but Stalin killed people.
[00:57:03.812 --> 00:57:05.854]  And they go, yeah, too bad he didn't kill you.
[00:57:06.314 --> 00:57:07.475]  We're going to kill you.
[00:57:07.495 --> 00:57:13.921]  And of course, they couldn't kill a paper bag, but don't worry, they'll take your money, hire mercenaries to do it.
[00:57:14.982 --> 00:57:15.463]  You understand?
[00:57:17.816 --> 00:57:21.962]  Let's go to Kerry saying kids are scared to come to America because of the guns.
[00:57:22.022 --> 00:57:24.285]  What, from their countries where only the government has the guns?
[00:57:24.565 --> 00:57:25.006]  Here it is.
[00:57:25.387 --> 00:57:31.535]  I've heard in a couple of quiet conversations with a few officials... Man, he's had Botox.
[00:57:31.755 --> 00:57:32.276]  ...two things.
[00:57:32.396 --> 00:57:33.157]  Number one... He's like a villain.
[00:57:33.923 --> 00:57:37.966]  How safe it is over here in this country where people are not running around with guns.
[00:57:37.986 --> 00:57:38.967]  That's what evil does to you.
[00:57:39.408 --> 00:57:42.930]  And number two, look how empty he is.
[00:57:43.191 --> 00:57:52.879]  How some students, we had an interesting discussion about why fewer students are coming to, particularly from Japan, to study in the United States.
[00:57:53.719 --> 00:58:00.024]  And one of the responses I got from our officials, from conversations with parents here,
[00:58:00.905 --> 00:58:02.246]  Is that they're actually scared.
[00:58:02.826 --> 00:58:05.047]  They think they're not safe in the United States.
[00:58:05.087 --> 00:58:06.567]  Well yeah, they're not safe from you.
[00:58:06.767 --> 00:58:12.290]  Actual travel studies show that people are scared of the government and the checkpoints and the TSA.
[00:58:12.630 --> 00:58:13.290]  That's real.
[00:58:13.630 --> 00:58:15.271]  Not lies coming out of your mouth.
[00:58:16.186 --> 00:58:18.569]  Now here's the FBI's own statistics over the last 20 years.
[00:58:19.770 --> 00:58:20.651]  49% drop in crime rate.
[00:58:20.911 --> 00:58:23.994]  And you and your brethren criminals, street thugs are just like Gary.
[00:58:24.395 --> 00:58:25.216]  He's just a bigger one.
[00:58:25.656 --> 00:58:27.518]  They all instinctively hate good people.
[00:58:27.558 --> 00:58:29.040]  I'm gonna spice it up to you.
[00:58:29.400 --> 00:58:30.622]  They hate you.
[00:58:31.122 --> 00:58:31.763]  You understand that?
[00:58:31.803 --> 00:58:34.626]  These criminals hate you because you're a good person.
[00:58:35.006 --> 00:58:35.907]  Figure that out.
[00:58:36.168 --> 00:58:37.109]  They're evil.
[00:58:37.389 --> 00:58:37.849]  Stay with us.
[00:58:42.526 --> 00:58:46.530]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.

[00:59:19.282 --> 00:59:25.487]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.
[00:59:26.207 --> 00:59:36.637]  But rather we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the silver more effectively.

[00:59:52.836 --> 00:59:54.758]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.238 --> 00:59:58.080]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:04.546 --> 01:00:05.206]  Big Brother.
[01:00:05.847 --> 01:00:06.908]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:07.628 --> 01:00:08.870]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.390 --> 01:00:10.191]  You want answers?
[01:00:10.971 --> 01:00:11.832]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.513 --> 01:00:16.156]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.696 --> 01:00:20.780]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.916 --> 01:00:30.903]  I have met at my office one of the assistant, well one of the prosecutors, not the head.
[01:00:31.644 --> 01:00:32.565]  Austin prosecutor.
[01:00:33.866 --> 01:00:38.051]  And they came to my office because they were, well I'm not going to get into the whole story.
[01:00:38.631 --> 01:00:41.654]  And they showed me their card and I knew who they were with, that's how they were brought here.
[01:00:42.663 --> 01:00:44.205]  And I looked the person up.
[01:00:44.946 --> 01:00:46.649]  It was about a year ago, two years ago now.
[01:00:47.229 --> 01:00:53.157]  And they told me, they said, listen, the judges give illegal aliens $5 fines for drunk driving.
[01:00:53.217 --> 01:00:55.981]  And even if they run over somebody, they don't get charged.
[01:00:56.742 --> 01:00:58.124]  And we've just been told, do it.
[01:00:59.025 --> 01:01:08.731]  And that also covered how banks, like 10 years ago, came out and said, we give illegal aliens loans with no IDs, no proof, as part of a program to incentivize coming to America.
[01:01:08.971 --> 01:01:14.114]  It's like, you know, you can have your babies for free, and they put ads in Mexican newspapers, come up and have your kids for free.
[01:01:14.294 --> 01:01:15.455]  It's about bankrupting America.
[01:01:15.655 --> 01:01:19.637]  The globalists are just going to loan America more fiat dollars to get real infrastructure.
[01:01:19.657 --> 01:01:26.161]  So anyway, you know, if it's a $5 million test of shrimp on treadmills, I'm not joking,
[01:01:27.093 --> 01:01:30.115]  I think it was a $5 million... Guys, look up study of shrimp on treadmills.
[01:01:30.135 --> 01:01:31.917]  I think it was 5 mil a few years ago.
[01:01:32.497 --> 01:01:44.526]  Or, you know, whether it's a $10 million UT female masturbation study, or whether it's a study to teach elementary students how to masturbate, you know, $100 million program, Jocelyn Elders, whatever.
[01:01:46.133 --> 01:01:50.275]  Any way they can bankrupt us and just get us used to walking all over us.
[01:01:50.596 --> 01:01:51.896]  Here's the new article.
[01:01:52.376 --> 01:01:52.717]  There it is.
[01:01:53.197 --> 01:01:55.478]  Tax dollars fund shrimp on treadmills.
[01:01:56.178 --> 01:01:58.240]  Jell-O wrestling in Antarctica.
[01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:02.182]  Report says Federal Research Agency mismanaged $3 billion.
[01:02:03.222 --> 01:02:06.505]  Alex, you exaggerate.
[01:02:06.525 --> 01:02:09.627]  You said 5 million, it was 3 billion.
[01:02:10.027 --> 01:02:11.948]  Yeah, I remember the headline.
[01:02:11.988 --> 01:02:14.010]  It was 5 million for shrimp on treadmills.
[01:02:14.030 --> 01:02:15.370]  I think that's the Fox News headline.
[01:02:15.390 --> 01:02:17.512]  I think it was 5 million out of the 3 billion.
[01:02:19.073 --> 01:02:20.294]  Again, and they will take
[01:02:21.872 --> 01:02:26.573]  They will take an old lady's house who's eating dog food in the poorest part of Austin.
[01:02:26.593 --> 01:02:30.134]  I've done these reports years ago when I had time to do local reports, but you know about it.
[01:02:30.994 --> 01:02:41.796]  When an old 80-year-old woman can't pay her property taxes and is on $600 a month Social Security and has all these medical bills and literally, literally has to go get charity.
[01:02:41.816 --> 01:02:49.418]  And I tell you, I used to do my AXS TV show and I'd do one report on old people and I'd get hundreds of calls to my comment line with no crew.
[01:02:50.506 --> 01:02:57.309]  And I would hear these old ladies and old men begging going, I'm over here in a trailer and they say they're going to take my plot.
[01:02:57.349 --> 01:02:59.190]  The trailer's only worth probably $20,000.
[01:02:59.691 --> 01:03:01.812]  I've been in it, you know, 30 something years.
[01:03:01.832 --> 01:03:02.912]  There's holes in the roof.
[01:03:03.373 --> 01:03:09.356]  But they want it and they're going, they're coming next week to take my trailer!
[01:03:09.416 --> 01:03:13.778]  They're coming next week to take my trailer!
[01:03:14.966 --> 01:03:16.970]  And I have like a hundred phone calls.
[01:03:16.990 --> 01:03:20.197]  Mike Hanson used to take it over for me and he couldn't listen to it.
[01:03:20.418 --> 01:03:21.500]  It'll drive you crazy.
[01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:24.567]  You can't even call him back, much less go out there.
[01:03:27.970 --> 01:03:41.356]  And you go out there, and one guy's got colon cancer, and you see blood and bandages seeping out of his trousers, and he's sitting there going, yeah, I was in the quarry, or my wife died of cancer.
[01:03:41.376 --> 01:03:44.738]  They're going to take my three-inch grass.
[01:03:44.758 --> 01:03:46.278]  But I got out, and I'm on it.
[01:03:46.678 --> 01:03:47.199]  I'm on it.
[01:03:47.539 --> 01:03:48.039]  I'm on it.
[01:03:48.379 --> 01:03:51.261]  And I guess I'm trying to beat this cancer right now.
[01:03:52.241 --> 01:03:56.243]  If they won't take back the two weeks I was in the hospital, three-inch grass,
[01:03:57.683 --> 01:04:01.185]  $2,000 fines a day and other objectionable material.
[01:04:01.545 --> 01:04:04.967]  And the zone person, I've had my hat in my hand.
[01:04:04.987 --> 01:04:08.248]  And I said, sir, I can't move these logs in the backyard.
[01:04:08.808 --> 01:04:12.270]  And I'm trying to get a company in to do it, but I'm on Social Security.
[01:04:12.830 --> 01:04:15.531]  And for some reason, the VA don't send a check no more.
[01:04:15.551 --> 01:04:17.432]  They're looking at you with all their teeth missing.
[01:04:17.832 --> 01:04:20.773]  Oh, Mr. Jones, I want to thank you.
[01:04:21.214 --> 01:04:23.555]  And that's why I can't do this anymore.
[01:04:24.495 --> 01:04:37.128]  Show that Obama can spend millions of dollars a night in a hotel, and Biden can spend $500,000 while they're shooting kids up with poison shots, and I could get hundreds of calls a week.
[01:04:37.669 --> 01:04:39.891]  They always target old people, the zoning department.
[01:04:40.231 --> 01:04:42.754]  And man, they take their houses and throw them in a nursing home.
[01:04:43.115 --> 01:04:45.318]  And now they wear uniforms with police badges.
[01:04:45.758 --> 01:04:47.220]  I want to tell all those people something.
[01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:48.962]  You're not going to get away with this.
[01:04:49.043 --> 01:04:52.407]  I hope you know God is going to strike your butt down.
[01:04:52.827 --> 01:04:53.649]  You are cursed!
[01:04:54.149 --> 01:04:54.950]  You understand that?
[01:04:54.970 --> 01:04:56.212]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:56.232 --> 01:04:56.672]  Stay with us.

[01:05:48.379 --> 01:05:50.422]  And sodium hexafluorosilicate.

[01:06:00.177 --> 01:06:08.420]  Devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, or the threat of martial law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies.
[01:06:08.721 --> 01:06:12.162]  As a result, millions are stockpiling food, gold, and weapons.
[01:06:12.402 --> 01:06:16.544]  But how will these items help if you or one of your loved ones becomes ill?

[01:06:59.659 --> 01:07:01.580]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:03.861]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[01:07:04.022 --> 01:07:09.265]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[01:07:09.485 --> 01:07:13.267]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[01:07:13.527 --> 01:07:17.289]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[01:07:17.449 --> 01:07:18.650]  The fact is, you are.
[01:07:18.850 --> 01:07:19.630]  We all are.
[01:07:19.871 --> 01:07:22.192]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[01:07:22.492 --> 01:07:30.860]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoods Direct.

[01:08:09.549 --> 01:08:10.370]  You want answers?
[01:08:11.151 --> 01:08:12.012]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:12.672 --> 01:08:16.316]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:16.876 --> 01:08:20.961]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:29.304 --> 01:08:33.528]  You know, the Obama people like to quote the Bible and say, thou shalt not kill.
[01:08:34.188 --> 01:08:44.418]  But if you actually go to the Hebrew and Greek translations, thou shalt not murder means in cold blood, wrongly, someone who's innocent.
[01:08:45.452 --> 01:08:48.053]  And that's the common law of all cultures.
[01:08:49.313 --> 01:08:55.115]  What is basically illegal is going and killing someone who's done nothing.
[01:08:55.515 --> 01:08:58.476]  Knocking somebody on the head to basically rob them.
[01:08:58.916 --> 01:09:14.420]  And my son heard me talking about people that hurt innocents, how it will come back on them, and he happened to have in his book bag, he's here with me today, Discover's Bible, a large print Bible for early readers, and he was reading me from Genesis,
[01:09:15.799 --> 01:09:23.331]  Genesis 21 9 verse 6, anyone who murders man will be killed by man.
[01:09:23.351 --> 01:09:27.076]  This is because I have made man in my own likeness.
[01:09:28.459 --> 01:09:38.006]  So anyone who murders, murders, murders, not, not, okay, just to say thou shalt not kill, no, it's thou shalt not murder.
[01:09:38.686 --> 01:09:42.749]  Because, you know, you can see the government saying they're going to kill whole villages to get one bad guy.
[01:09:43.029 --> 01:09:44.630]  Why is that supposedly okay?
[01:09:45.030 --> 01:09:45.851]  Well, that is wrong.
[01:09:45.891 --> 01:09:46.852]  That is unjust war.
[01:09:48.706 --> 01:09:55.649]  And we've just accepted so many out-of-control things in this society.
[01:09:56.630 --> 01:10:03.293]  Now is the time to realize that the people are perishing for lack of knowledge.
[01:10:03.333 --> 01:10:05.234]  But again, there it is, Genesis 8, 21.
[01:10:07.855 --> 01:10:13.777]  I guess, is it chapter 9, verse 6?
[01:10:13.917 --> 01:10:17.339]  Anyone who murders man will be killed by man.
[01:10:18.564 --> 01:10:20.888]  That is because I have made man in my own likeness.
[01:10:21.369 --> 01:10:23.933]  That's the same thing as those that live by the sword die by the sword.
[01:10:24.194 --> 01:10:28.141]  It doesn't mean having a sword or defending yourself you're going to be killed by the sword.
[01:10:28.181 --> 01:10:30.906]  It means those that live by the sword.
[01:10:32.722 --> 01:10:34.744]  Living, you're out taking with the sword.
[01:10:35.044 --> 01:10:37.365]  You will surely die by the sword.
[01:10:37.786 --> 01:10:43.850]  All of you that serve evil and think you're going to be on the winning team, because you're so scared of the system, you think you'll just, well, that's the winning team.
[01:10:44.170 --> 01:10:45.171]  I'll go curl up to that.
[01:10:45.531 --> 01:10:48.573]  You lead cursed lives for a reason.
[01:10:48.673 --> 01:10:50.375]  Your family's breaking up for a reason.
[01:10:50.795 --> 01:10:58.821]  Your child, because you trusted the system and took all the vaccines and eat GMO, because you lie to yourself, you're going to be cursed by your own actions.
[01:11:00.342 --> 01:11:01.564]  And that's not mumbo-jumbo.
[01:11:01.884 --> 01:11:02.925]  That's not magic.
[01:11:03.266 --> 01:11:04.407]  That's common sense.
[01:11:04.748 --> 01:11:06.129]  Thank you, son, for bringing the book in.
[01:11:06.150 --> 01:11:10.615]  All right, I want to open the phones up in this second hour.
[01:11:10.635 --> 01:11:12.457]  A lot of stations join us in the second and third hour.
[01:11:12.477 --> 01:11:16.162]  I want to welcome all of you aboard here today.
[01:11:17.310 --> 01:11:20.131]  And we are here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:11:20.151 --> 01:11:20.491]  to 2 p.m.
[01:11:20.511 --> 01:11:23.851]  Central, back at night, 7 o'clock Central, with InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:11:23.911 --> 01:11:29.453]  If you are not a PrisonPlanet.tv subscriber, you go to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:11:29.473 --> 01:11:33.673]  We're fighting the construction of the prison planet with InfoWarsNews.com.
[01:11:33.693 --> 01:11:34.534]  That'll also get you there.
[01:11:34.614 --> 01:11:35.474]  Eleven memberships.
[01:11:35.574 --> 01:11:36.694]  I didn't plug anything last hour.
[01:11:37.254 --> 01:11:38.454]  Eleven memberships for $5.95 a month.
[01:11:38.494 --> 01:11:38.695]  That is...
[01:11:41.666 --> 01:11:44.148]  Uh, 55 cents or less per person.
[01:11:44.729 --> 01:11:48.792]  One username passcode, create an original code you can share, give it to friends and family.
[01:11:48.812 --> 01:11:50.573]  I say you can probably give it up to 50 people.
[01:11:51.333 --> 01:11:58.679]  And just say, hey, here's your gift of a username passcode to see all these films in high def, to see the nightly news, to see video of the radio show.
[01:12:00.502 --> 01:12:06.463]  Also, send people the free iPhone app or the free Android apps that are in the Listen page of Infowars.com.
[01:12:06.483 --> 01:12:08.744]  Just click on that tab or PrisonPlanet.com will take you there.
[01:12:08.764 --> 01:12:18.685]  I mean, the Eddie Craig presents how to protect your rights as an American citizen, Air Force officer, and then, of course, Nacogdoches Sheriff's Deputy that saw the corruption and stood up against it.
[01:12:19.205 --> 01:12:27.407]  Probably one of the best, most well-spoken, not patriot mythology, but real hardcore pro se, just showing how basically everything the police do is illegal now.
[01:12:28.326 --> 01:12:31.587]  And most police don't even know it, because it's all done in legalese.
[01:12:31.667 --> 01:12:33.428]  Police all need to see it.
[01:12:33.708 --> 01:12:35.289]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:12:35.949 --> 01:12:38.450]  And again, that just pays for the bandwidth.
[01:12:38.470 --> 01:12:45.113]  If you want to support us by the ProPure water filters, the lowest price out there, promo code WATER at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:12:45.653 --> 01:12:48.034]  Promo code WATER gets you 10% off the already lowest price.
[01:12:48.274 --> 01:12:55.457]  We've now launched the Seed Center, a year of research, the best reviews, the non-GMO, non-hybrid heirloom seeds.
[01:12:55.797 --> 01:12:57.498]  We've got cases that have
[01:12:58.438 --> 01:13:00.599]  You know, 50,000 seeds at the lowest price.
[01:13:00.619 --> 01:13:02.660]  5,000 seeds at the lowest price.
[01:13:03.060 --> 01:13:02.660]  50,000.
[01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:10.042]  10,000.
[01:13:05.321 --> 01:13:10.042]  We're now carrying six different companies, six different brands at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:13:13.003 --> 01:13:16.665]  And, you know, these seeds will save many of them a hundred years, by the way.
[01:13:16.805 --> 01:13:20.486]  So, you can also buy a couple of this seed vault.
[01:13:20.806 --> 01:13:21.546]  It's a great system.
[01:13:21.566 --> 01:13:22.827]  The seed arc is amazing.
[01:13:24.086 --> 01:13:24.727]  I don't know.
[01:13:43.533 --> 01:13:44.794]  This supports the broadcast.
[01:13:44.834 --> 01:13:46.135]  We sell things we believe in.
[01:13:46.255 --> 01:13:47.436]  Infowarshealth.com.
[01:13:47.736 --> 01:13:49.497]  The best vitamins, minerals, products there.
[01:13:49.837 --> 01:13:55.401]  Purchasing from us also funds the operation so we can boldly go 110% up against the enemy.
[01:13:55.681 --> 01:13:58.983]  Now, I want to give the number out on these articles.
[01:13:59.904 --> 01:14:02.105]  What do you think of gold being artificially plunged?
[01:14:02.125 --> 01:14:03.006]  I mean, it's on record.
[01:14:03.827 --> 01:14:04.607]  It's all staged.
[01:14:04.627 --> 01:14:06.368]  I'm going to get some experts on this week.
[01:14:06.488 --> 01:14:11.992]  Anybody can pull up the articles where they admit the big banks go in there and short sell.
[01:14:12.032 --> 01:14:12.933]  They go in there and they
[01:14:14.815 --> 01:14:15.396]  We're good to go.
[01:14:25.433 --> 01:14:31.238]  And then basically sell also their own gold holdings into the market at reduced prices.
[01:14:32.119 --> 01:14:38.224]  I mean, Gordon Brown sold England's, what was it, a decade ago or more gold supply at a third of what it was worth.
[01:14:38.244 --> 01:14:39.265]  You can look that up.
[01:14:39.705 --> 01:14:43.048]  I mean, it is just crazy what they're doing.
[01:14:43.248 --> 01:14:46.391]  And I've told people they can drive anything down.
[01:14:46.651 --> 01:14:49.694]  They can do anything artificial now, but not long term.
[01:14:50.154 --> 01:14:51.475]  They can do anything.
[01:14:51.755 --> 01:14:53.557]  They could probably make gold be worth zero.
[01:14:54.980 --> 01:14:56.060]  You know, down to 10 cents.
[01:14:57.341 --> 01:15:00.641]  But in the real market it won't be, and at that price you wouldn't be able to buy any.
[01:15:01.522 --> 01:15:02.942]  They could say the moon was made out of cheese.
[01:15:03.422 --> 01:15:06.403]  They could say 2 plus 2 equals 10, and they now teach that in public schools.
[01:15:06.803 --> 01:15:12.424]  They actually teach it could be whatever you think, to just create total disassociation from reality.
[01:15:12.844 --> 01:15:17.405]  I think that right now the question is, do we all work for central bankers?
[01:15:17.445 --> 01:15:19.646]  That's what I want to address to our guest tonight.
[01:15:20.226 --> 01:15:22.268]  Is this global governance at last?
[01:15:22.368 --> 01:15:24.830]  Is it one world, the central bankers in charge?
[01:15:24.850 --> 01:15:29.735]  Jim Iorio, you say we've got some downside here, a correction in the markets.
[01:15:29.815 --> 01:15:30.175]  Fine.
[01:15:30.515 --> 01:15:34.019]  But aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[01:15:34.099 --> 01:15:41.505]  Aren't we all just counting on the fact that there's a Bernanke putt and that we won't go any lower than, say, 5% down from here?
[01:15:42.606 --> 01:15:46.807]  Of course we are, because if we look at the economic data, there's nothing to get excited about in that.
[01:15:47.147 --> 01:15:51.668]  So we, you know, yesterday we saw some reluctance for the Bernanke Fed to expand.
[01:15:51.708 --> 01:15:52.768]  That's good.
[01:15:52.808 --> 01:15:59.889]  Now separately, it's in the Financial Times of London, AP Reuters, Time Magazine, that, hey, there's a global government run by private mega banks.
[01:15:59.909 --> 01:16:06.551]  They're going to need $100 trillion in the next decade of your tax money via carbon taxes, Tobin taxes, and global VAT.
[01:16:08.051 --> 01:16:10.953]  And they're going to fix the world economy by running the planet.
[01:16:11.313 --> 01:16:13.335]  And by the way, they're exempt from the taxes themselves.
[01:16:13.655 --> 01:16:14.836]  From EU bureaucrats up.
[01:16:16.036 --> 01:16:21.079]  But if you go, hey, I think that's a terrible idea, they go, whoa, Southern Broadway Law Center, ADL, this doesn't exist.
[01:16:21.380 --> 01:16:24.602]  There are crazy people that believe there's a global takeover by megabanks.
[01:16:25.390 --> 01:16:27.690]  Yeah, the John Birch Society, they said that in the fifties.
[01:16:28.090 --> 01:16:38.592]  Man, they're really bad people for being absolutely accurate sixty-plus years before their time because they had high-level military officers that weren't traitors who were let in on the operation that warned them.
[01:16:39.372 --> 01:16:40.853]  Man, yeah, they're kooks.
[01:16:41.153 --> 01:16:52.195]  Yeah, those patriots, that Alex Jones, you know, he said seventeen years ago they were setting up a new world order run by megabanks because he happened to have read books by Barry Goldwater, who was witnessing it all as a senator.
[01:16:52.215 --> 01:16:54.535]  Yeah, man, he's a bad guy for being informed.
[01:16:57.935 --> 01:17:01.597]  I mean, this is getting so out of control.
[01:17:01.617 --> 01:17:05.499]  This is a war against reality.
[01:17:05.799 --> 01:17:11.862]  And I want your take on this clip, again, that's up at DrugsReport.com on the left-hand side.
[01:17:11.962 --> 01:17:13.143]  I'm going to have it reposted.
[01:17:13.163 --> 01:17:14.183]  Have them repost it, too.
[01:17:14.483 --> 01:17:16.664]  I want it at PrisonPlanetInfoWarsRedLink.
[01:17:18.685 --> 01:17:24.708]  It's got the clips of Californians saying, arrest the partiers, take all their guns, put them in jail.
[01:17:24.728 --> 01:17:25.048]  Here it is.
[01:17:27.202 --> 01:17:36.347]  By, uh, by repealing the Second Amendment, what that'll do is we'll have a door-to-door gun confiscation against the white people, the right-wing extremists.
[01:17:36.568 --> 01:17:36.888]  Okay.
[01:17:36.928 --> 01:17:37.928]  Take away their guns.
[01:17:38.108 --> 01:17:38.709]  What birthday?
[01:17:38.829 --> 01:17:40.230]  What's the, what's the... Oh, my birthday.
[01:17:40.250 --> 01:17:41.250]  Yeah, your birthday, yeah.
[01:17:41.270 --> 01:17:49.715]  Just repealing the Second Amendment, door-to-door gun confiscations, then that way only the unregistered guns will be out, and it'll be, we'll be much safer that way.
[01:17:49.735 --> 01:17:50.396]  Got you.
[01:17:50.416 --> 01:17:51.756]  Thank you, thank you for supporting that.
[01:17:51.776 --> 01:17:52.397]  No doubt, no doubt.
[01:17:53.747 --> 01:17:55.129]  It just goes on and on, that's enough.
[01:17:55.429 --> 01:17:58.632]  Full video at InfoWars.com, full video at DrudgeReport.com.
[01:17:59.092 --> 01:18:01.695]  But I'm telling you, all of you, it's time to fight.
[01:18:01.795 --> 01:18:03.676]  Take your iPhone, take your camera.
[01:18:04.197 --> 01:18:06.359]  You don't have to be a, quote, expert to fight the tyranny.
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:08.381]  These are zombies you're talking about.
[01:18:08.421 --> 01:18:09.902]  I mean, you're like a god compared to them.
[01:18:10.082 --> 01:18:11.584]  I'm very sad for them, but literally.
[01:18:12.124 --> 01:18:15.988]  Go out to an anti-gun rally, or go to a Democratic Party rally, have a hidden camera.
[01:18:16.008 --> 01:18:16.748]  They're very cheap now.
[01:18:17.797 --> 01:18:18.438]  I don't know.
[01:18:35.573 --> 01:18:40.094]  Fourteen of them say you can't tape or videotape people without them knowing.
[01:18:40.995 --> 01:18:42.495]  But again, that's not even in a public place.
[01:18:42.515 --> 01:18:45.256]  But the cops are arresting people that film on the side of the highway.
[01:18:45.436 --> 01:18:48.617]  If you film cops in Illinois from your own car, they take you to jail.
[01:18:49.497 --> 01:18:51.758]  I mean, just, it doesn't matter how many times the court throw it out.
[01:18:51.798 --> 01:18:58.760]  The point is, I think everybody, to give a little lesson there on filming in public, because it's such a free country, you go out
[01:18:59.716 --> 01:19:09.121]  And go to their meetings and go, yeah, man, I think we ought to just arrest all the libertarians and put them in a forced labor camp, and then they could be productive part of the economy.
[01:19:09.741 --> 01:19:15.584]  And I guarantee you they're going to say, yes, yes, do what Veritas Project's done, do what we do, do what Mark Dice has done.
[01:19:15.644 --> 01:19:22.527]  I'm telling you, we've got to have a counter-offensive against their counter-offensive, and really go show who they are.
[01:19:22.847 --> 01:19:24.048]  That's what will bring them down.
[01:19:25.128 --> 01:19:30.854]  I mean, I've gotten video, you know, over the years of them saying they're going to bring in world government, they're going to break up the family.
[01:19:31.114 --> 01:19:32.195]  Now they say it publicly.
[01:19:33.530 --> 01:19:36.271]  I want to get your take on all this.
[01:19:36.291 --> 01:19:36.671]  800-259-9231.
[01:19:36.691 --> 01:19:37.672]  800-259-9231.
[01:19:37.692 --> 01:19:43.994]  And this is the big news up at InfoWars.com right now.
[01:19:44.514 --> 01:19:46.715]  Big Sis coordinating gun confiscations.
[01:19:47.075 --> 01:19:49.496]  And this also just broke at InfoWars.com.
[01:19:50.916 --> 01:19:58.099]  Because an illegal alien had a unique cultural background, he's allowed to... Well, I'm going to tell you about this when we come back.
[01:20:01.539 --> 01:20:04.400]  Ceramic Body Armor is rated to stop six hits.
[01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:05.840]  But what about the seventh?
[01:20:06.060 --> 01:20:10.101]  Unlike Ceramic or Kevlar, Infidel Body Armor is proven to take hit after hit.
[01:20:10.321 --> 01:20:11.641]  And it just won't quit.
[01:20:11.861 --> 01:20:18.342]  Reasonably priced and designed for the smart civilian prepper, Infidel stops hundreds of hits from small arms to high-powered rifles.
[01:20:18.562 --> 01:20:20.543]  That means safety and peace of mind.

[01:20:27.164 --> 01:20:28.204]  Infidel Body Armor.
[01:20:28.624 --> 01:20:29.505]  Just won't quit.
[01:20:29.605 --> 01:20:38.878]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[01:20:38.938 --> 01:20:39.679]  This capitalism?
[01:20:39.739 --> 01:20:45.827]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:20:45.987 --> 01:20:46.768]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[01:20:46.808 --> 01:20:49.890]  I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[01:21:00.359 --> 01:21:03.020]  The coming financial collapse is real.
[01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:06.142]  The subsequent social unrest will happen.
[01:21:06.602 --> 01:21:10.543]  Even if you made it out of suburbia alive, where would you take your family?

[01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:50.460]  Water.
[01:21:51.041 --> 01:21:51.521]  Energy.
[01:21:52.022 --> 01:21:52.322]  Food.
[01:21:52.822 --> 01:21:53.263]  Defense.
[01:21:53.663 --> 01:22:01.749]  SurvivalRetreatConsulting.com SurvivalRetreatConsulting.com In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[01:22:01.789 --> 01:22:03.691]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[01:22:03.951 --> 01:22:09.395]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[01:22:09.615 --> 01:22:13.378]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[01:22:13.639 --> 01:22:15.460]  You may think out of sight, out of mind.
[01:22:15.720 --> 01:22:17.362]  And so you don't think you will be affected.
[01:22:17.522 --> 01:22:18.703]  The fact is you are.
[01:22:18.903 --> 01:22:19.684]  We all are.
[01:22:19.924 --> 01:22:22.267]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[01:22:22.547 --> 01:22:30.855]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoods Direct.

[01:22:59.881 --> 01:23:01.762]  We've lived in this neighborhood for years.
[01:23:02.263 --> 01:23:05.365]  We have an alarm system and all of our doors have deadbolts.
[01:23:05.806 --> 01:23:09.388]  They kicked in our door and were in and out of our house in about 5 minutes.
[01:23:09.769 --> 01:23:15.333]  The police arrived in about 20 minutes, but they were long gone with our TV, jewelry, and my guns.
[01:23:15.673 --> 01:23:18.215]  I kept thinking, what if my family had been home?
[01:23:18.575 --> 01:23:25.541]  The police officer said that more than 85% of break-ins are through a door, and that deadbolts alone don't stop intruders.
[01:23:26.101 --> 01:23:31.584]  The officer told me to go to EasyArmor.net if we wanted something that would actually stop an intruder.
[01:23:31.964 --> 01:23:37.787]  EasyArmor reinforces all of the weak points on your doors and is guaranteed to prevent kick-ins.
[01:23:38.087 --> 01:23:43.570]  I was surprised at how little EasyArmor costs and I installed EasyArmor in about 30 minutes.
[01:23:44.130 --> 01:23:45.591]  Visit EasyArmor.net.
[01:23:45.731 --> 01:23:48.753]  That's the letters E-Z-A-R-M-O-R.net.
[01:23:48.893 --> 01:23:49.774]  Or call 888-58-ARMOR.
[01:23:49.794 --> 01:23:50.314]  That's 888-582-7667.
[01:23:50.374 --> 01:23:50.975]  EasyArmor.net.
[01:23:51.035 --> 01:23:52.416]  Ultimate door security made easy.
[01:24:21.275 --> 01:24:25.099]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are capturing it right now, during the break.
[01:24:27.381 --> 01:24:32.846]  During the break, out there on the television, and you know with these new DVRs the last few years, you can just rewind what was live.
[01:24:33.746 --> 01:24:34.767]  You've probably already seen it.
[01:24:34.787 --> 01:24:47.459]  They now have Pillsbury Doughboy ads, where the TSA gropes the Pillsbury Doughboy, and it is a bunch of fun to have this basically done to him.
[01:24:48.618 --> 01:24:50.280]  Again, everything is acclimation.
[01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:55.184]  The TV shows, the radio, the mainline radio, the print stuff.
[01:24:58.066 --> 01:25:01.630]  He loves it too when he gets grubbed.
[01:25:02.270 --> 01:25:03.091]  Oh, he likes it.
[01:25:04.292 --> 01:25:06.093]  Sir, I'll get it together.
[01:25:06.514 --> 01:25:06.874]  I promise.
[01:25:06.894 --> 01:25:10.657]  Look, the TSA is wearing like a police badge.
[01:25:10.677 --> 01:25:11.879]  Going for his crotch.
[01:25:11.919 --> 01:25:14.281]  How happy are folks who save hundreds of dollars switching a guy?
[01:25:16.408 --> 01:25:19.731]  Oh, it's a Geico ad with the Pillsbury Doughboy?
[01:25:20.092 --> 01:25:22.073]  So I guess they're doing unified deals now.
[01:25:22.154 --> 01:25:25.397]  I see more and more ads where they, it's like Predator vs. Alien.
[01:25:26.378 --> 01:25:34.685]  And, again, oh, it's the new sacrament in America to have your junk grubbed.
[01:25:36.988 --> 01:25:38.949]  John is saying that Rockefeller owns Geico.
[01:25:38.969 --> 01:25:39.530]  Look into that.
[01:25:40.050 --> 01:25:41.452]  Look into the conglomerate that owns it.
[01:25:43.126 --> 01:25:53.851]  By the way, up at InfoWars.com right now, illegal immigrant DUI killer ruled incompetent because of his unique cultural background.
[01:25:55.352 --> 01:26:12.240]  A self-confessed illegal immigrant in Milford, Mass., faces 15 years of found guilty of vehicular homicide, but it's a big if, as it stands right now, Nicholas D. Gauman has been found incompetent to stand trial because he doesn't speak English and doesn't understand the American legal system.
[01:26:13.613 --> 01:26:15.634]  And again, illegal aliens are allowed to drink and drive.
[01:26:15.674 --> 01:26:20.918]  They're allowed to, I mean, it's on record where sheriffs arrest them and then the prosecutors let them go.
[01:26:23.619 --> 01:26:28.702]  Critics say he had an accomplice, Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick.
[01:26:29.303 --> 01:26:30.083]  Deval Patrick.
[01:26:31.284 --> 01:26:37.308]  And it goes on to say that, say that, well, he's basically above the law.
[01:26:39.485 --> 01:26:50.228]  By the way, the Travis County prosecutor got arrested while drinking and driving, and she's admitted to it, up by the entrance to Steiner Ranch out by Lakeway.
[01:26:51.607 --> 01:26:53.129]  And I actually know people that know her.
[01:26:53.829 --> 01:26:58.874]  And, I mean, she sounds like she's not the sharpest knife in the drawer.
[01:26:59.875 --> 01:27:01.957]  And she's like, I was having an evening.
[01:27:01.997 --> 01:27:02.558]  Yeah, I did.
[01:27:02.918 --> 01:27:14.310]  Reportedly, according to the witnesses that called 911 on her, and then the cops that showed up, she was driving down the wrong side of the road, doing circles in a major highway, bombed out of her brain.
[01:27:15.816 --> 01:27:16.196]  There it is.
[01:27:16.377 --> 01:27:18.859]  After drunk driving arrest, Travis County D.A.
[01:27:18.899 --> 01:27:20.881]  apologizes, says she'll remain in office.
[01:27:21.261 --> 01:27:33.494]  And I know people... One of my friends had some guys jump out of a car one time, follow him to his house, get in his face, because they claimed that he cut him off.
[01:27:36.127 --> 01:27:37.488]  He can tell the story later if he wants.
[01:27:37.508 --> 01:27:40.430]  He didn't say I couldn't tell, but I'm not going to say his name, but he's a well-known guy in Austin.
[01:27:41.191 --> 01:27:42.592]  And they jump out, get in his face.
[01:27:42.612 --> 01:27:43.712]  He gets back in their face.
[01:27:44.413 --> 01:27:45.193]  He's a big guy.
[01:27:45.313 --> 01:27:46.514]  They run off and leave.
[01:27:47.495 --> 01:27:52.438]  And then his brother looks like him and was probably well...
[01:27:53.627 --> 01:27:57.610]  More well-known at the time, because they both, you know, had celebrity jobs.
[01:27:57.750 --> 01:28:01.433]  One's a country music singer, the other a champion rodeo guy.
[01:28:02.394 --> 01:28:11.200]  And this prosecutor, even when there were witnesses and everything, and, hey, it's not my brother, it's me, was still going to prosecute him.
[01:28:13.062 --> 01:28:14.983]  And didn't care, reportedly.
[01:28:16.900 --> 01:28:20.921]  Until they had all these witnesses and everybody that knows that this is the person.
[01:28:21.181 --> 01:28:24.242]  And then they had to drop that anyway because he hadn't even done anything.
[01:28:26.503 --> 01:28:32.425]  And the brother had to go before the Travis County Grand Jury and said, I want to speak to him.
[01:28:32.705 --> 01:28:35.186]  And went and said, this prosecutor is crazy.
[01:28:35.786 --> 01:28:36.667]  This is my brother.
[01:28:36.807 --> 01:28:37.447]  This is me.
[01:28:37.647 --> 01:28:38.487]  This is my house.
[01:28:38.547 --> 01:28:39.388]  This is my truck.
[01:28:40.528 --> 01:28:42.769]  My brother wasn't even in town when this happened.
[01:28:43.109 --> 01:28:44.169]  And they don't even care.
[01:28:44.349 --> 01:28:46.390]  And the Grand Jury, no build.
[01:28:48.823 --> 01:28:52.346]  And again, it's like the Michael Morton case up in Williamson County.
[01:28:52.686 --> 01:28:54.047]  It's world famous now.
[01:28:54.127 --> 01:28:55.789]  He stayed in jail 20-something years.
[01:28:56.469 --> 01:28:57.490]  His wife killed.
[01:28:58.551 --> 01:29:01.854]  Bloody bandana outside with an ex-con killer's blood on it.
[01:29:02.334 --> 01:29:05.517]  And the prosecutor asked the state police, you know, let's not do anything with that.
[01:29:05.877 --> 01:29:18.067]  And it kept the guy in jail because, you know, a decade or so into his sentence, they had all the DNA sample, had the DNA sample of the guy that had already killed later and been arrested and didn't want to test it.
[01:29:19.269 --> 01:29:22.510]  And then even when the DNA came out that it wasn't him, they wanted to keep him in jail.
[01:29:22.790 --> 01:29:24.310]  A father with no criminal record.
[01:29:24.350 --> 01:29:33.832]  It's like, the more innocent you are, the more under the jail, I guess like the devil gives them more lumps of sugar in their coffee when they burn innocent people.
[01:29:36.392 --> 01:29:42.613]  Alright, we'll be right back, but uh... Warren Buffett owns GEICO, yeah that's what I thought, and that's Rockefeller, yeah.
[01:29:42.953 --> 01:29:45.614]  So GEICO teaching you that your children being roped is a good thing.
[01:29:46.134 --> 01:29:47.054]  Everybody should boycott
[01:29:49.156 --> 01:29:50.037]  We're on the march.
[01:29:50.537 --> 01:29:52.438]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.058 --> 01:29:56.500]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:33:03.832 --> 01:33:17.326]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:24.079 --> 01:33:26.107]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:33:26.187 --> 01:33:27.010]  until 2 p.m.
[01:33:27.050 --> 01:33:27.974]  Central Standard Time.
[01:33:27.994 --> 01:33:28.375]  We're here.
[01:33:28.476 --> 01:33:28.656]  Back.
[01:33:29.798 --> 01:33:48.330]  Every weeknight, 7 o'clock central, with myself hosting the news, Jakari Jackson, of course, David Knight, Leigh-Anne McAdoo, Rob, Dude, did I mention John Bowne, so many others, Darren McBreen, Paul Watson, you name it.
[01:33:48.850 --> 01:33:54.173]  By the way, Paul Watson believes he's discovered the location of Bilderberg, 2013, outside London.
[01:33:54.193 --> 01:33:55.694]  He lives now in London.
[01:33:59.366 --> 01:34:06.011]  Or on the edge of London, and so he's going to be covering Bilderberg 2013 in June.
[01:34:06.731 --> 01:34:10.594]  And who knows if I will be parachuting into the confab.
[01:34:11.515 --> 01:34:13.957]  I mean that figuratively, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:34:14.735 --> 01:34:16.216]  All right, I said I'd go to your phone calls.
[01:34:17.216 --> 01:34:18.957]  Here's some of the news coming up after I do that.
[01:34:19.037 --> 01:34:20.798]  Big Sis coordinating gun confiscations.
[01:34:21.198 --> 01:34:22.479]  I think that's kind of important news.
[01:34:22.819 --> 01:34:27.101]  Illegal immigrant DUI killer ruled incompetent because of his unique cultural background.
[01:34:27.121 --> 01:34:29.442]  They're looking at just releasing him.
[01:34:29.662 --> 01:34:36.085]  They're reporting in the local news saying that everything wasn't in Spanish in Massachusetts and so it's that fault.
[01:34:36.465 --> 01:34:39.567]  He didn't know he could drink three times the legal limit and go kill some people.
[01:34:41.624 --> 01:34:46.269]  And when he drinks and drives, he gets off, and when the Travis County Prosecutor does, she gets off.
[01:34:46.709 --> 01:34:47.730]  She sounded so delusional.
[01:34:47.890 --> 01:34:49.192]  Can somebody find her on local news?
[01:34:49.532 --> 01:34:51.214]  I heard her on 590, our local affiliate.
[01:34:51.234 --> 01:34:54.837]  They were playing club stuff where she was going, I had an evening.
[01:34:56.124 --> 01:35:03.168]  I mean, let me tell you, folks, I don't drink a lot, but sometimes, you know, I'll go out to a party or an event or a wedding, and it's hard to not drink a couple glasses of wine.
[01:35:03.848 --> 01:35:07.390]  And then I will sit there and eat something, drink coffee, and wait.
[01:35:08.371 --> 01:35:16.135]  Or, you know, find somebody there and say, hey, take me home, just because they'll take you to jail, you know, for one beer in your body now.
[01:35:16.175 --> 01:35:20.378]  If you drink a beer and get pulled over right then, that's over 0.8 or whatever it is.
[01:35:20.958 --> 01:35:22.319]  I've talked to medical doctors about it.
[01:35:22.919 --> 01:35:27.343]  And the bars are right there, everybody knows, everybody's drinking, and it's all selectively enforced.
[01:35:27.543 --> 01:35:34.389]  I'm surprised this Travis Chowning, sheriff's deputy, did his job and arrested this lady.
[01:35:35.470 --> 01:35:40.114]  But he'll have a terrible future in his, you know, but I mean, they had to.
[01:35:40.154 --> 01:35:43.617]  She was driving on the wrong side, doing circles in a major highway.
[01:35:43.778 --> 01:35:47.100]  I mean, she's like, I had a little one.
[01:35:47.201 --> 01:35:48.362]  Oh, I bet you did, lady.
[01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:50.641]  I mean, I bet you did.
[01:35:50.661 --> 01:35:53.982]  I'd have to drink like four bottles of wine to be that drunk.
[01:35:55.883 --> 01:35:58.104]  Oh my God, in the interview, she sounds like she's had a lobotomy.
[01:35:58.604 --> 01:36:00.285]  I mean, I've heard it over and over on a local radio.
[01:36:00.305 --> 01:36:03.026]  She's like, I had a little evening, my son.
[01:36:03.666 --> 01:36:04.847]  You had a little evening.
[01:36:05.367 --> 01:36:07.148]  I mean, I'm just so sick of these people.
[01:36:07.428 --> 01:36:10.109]  That lady, by the way, lets illegal aliens go every day.
[01:36:10.129 --> 01:36:14.411]  But when she gets a good fat, let me tell you, that whole wealthy area by Steiner Ranch and
[01:36:15.464 --> 01:36:18.249]  Down in Lakeway, you know, with the $5 million houses.
[01:36:19.371 --> 01:36:21.855]  I go over there to see friends sometimes and I want to be out of there by 10.
[01:36:21.896 --> 01:36:24.340]  Because I've been pulled over, haven't been drinking.
[01:36:24.620 --> 01:36:25.983]  I mean, it's like piranhas.
[01:36:26.914 --> 01:36:28.975]  Look, you kind of passed that line back there.
[01:36:28.995 --> 01:36:29.836]  And I know I didn't.
[01:36:30.476 --> 01:36:31.617]  And I hadn't been drinking.
[01:36:32.137 --> 01:36:33.638]  Mind if I search the vehicle?
[01:36:33.658 --> 01:36:35.979]  Yeah, I do mind.
[01:36:36.019 --> 01:36:37.940]  You're not going to establish your fake probable cause.
[01:36:38.520 --> 01:36:39.561]  Okay, staring at my car.
[01:36:40.581 --> 01:36:41.542]  I mean, it's all good.
[01:36:41.642 --> 01:36:44.663]  Go arrest all your drunk bosses driving down the wrong side of the road.
[01:36:45.204 --> 01:36:46.164]  Leave me alone.
[01:36:46.184 --> 01:36:46.965]  Okay?
[01:36:47.065 --> 01:36:48.325]  Leave me alone.
[01:36:48.425 --> 01:36:49.366]  Leave me alone.
[01:36:50.387 --> 01:36:52.668]  I mean, I saw a well-known cop drinking tequila.
[01:36:53.522 --> 01:36:54.242]  In a restaurant.
[01:36:54.903 --> 01:36:55.563]  And I looked at him.
[01:36:55.583 --> 01:36:57.443]  The guy probably weighed 250 pounds.
[01:36:58.224 --> 01:36:59.684]  Waddle out, go to a movie.
[01:36:59.744 --> 01:37:01.125]  I went to the same theater.
[01:37:01.805 --> 01:37:04.666]  I watched him get out with his wife two hours later and drive off.
[01:37:04.726 --> 01:37:05.666]  I didn't call the cops on him.
[01:37:07.247 --> 01:37:08.747]  Because I'm not a sick freak.
[01:37:08.847 --> 01:37:11.188]  I'm like, he probably has a little alcohol in him.
[01:37:11.488 --> 01:37:14.189]  But I mean, that doesn't do anything to you when you weigh 250 pounds.
[01:37:14.730 --> 01:37:16.830]  I watched him drink a beer and two tequilas.
[01:37:17.691 --> 01:37:19.351]  Probably all out of his system in two hours.
[01:37:19.671 --> 01:37:21.512]  But let me tell you, most people would have called the cops on him.
[01:37:24.202 --> 01:37:26.143]  But my whole issue is, I am watching.
[01:37:26.203 --> 01:37:27.644]  Okay, I said I'd go to your phone calls.
[01:37:29.846 --> 01:37:32.648]  Man, I tell you, I want to get your take on everything.
[01:37:32.688 --> 01:37:34.009]  Guys, will you launch my phone system?
[01:37:34.029 --> 01:37:42.354]  I noticed at the start of the show it wasn't launched, and I forgot to launch that, so I'll probably actually need the phone system to take calls.
[01:37:42.394 --> 01:37:44.516]  But 800-259-9231, and we will get you up on air.
[01:37:49.059 --> 01:37:51.962]  We should have like a flight check, you know, like reboot computer, flight check.
[01:37:53.463 --> 01:37:54.424]  We actually do have one of those.
[01:37:55.225 --> 01:37:57.467]  Okay, call system is turned on.
[01:37:57.527 --> 01:37:58.368]  That's always important.
[01:37:58.388 --> 01:37:58.668]  Check.
[01:37:59.669 --> 01:38:00.570]  Lights are turned on.
[01:38:00.670 --> 01:38:00.990]  Check.
[01:38:02.151 --> 01:38:03.713]  Toilet paper is on toilet paper roll.
[01:38:03.733 --> 01:38:05.014]  David Rockefeller roll.
[01:38:05.034 --> 01:38:07.876]  I don't even know what that joke means at this point.
[01:38:08.937 --> 01:38:12.160]  So that is some of the news there.
[01:38:12.220 --> 01:38:14.583]  Okay, we're going to go to your phone calls right now.
[01:38:16.325 --> 01:38:18.707]  Let's talk to Stephen in Florida.
[01:38:18.787 --> 01:38:19.788]  You're on the air, Stephen.
[01:38:19.808 --> 01:38:20.128]  Welcome.
[01:38:21.229 --> 01:38:22.931]  Yeah, good afternoon, Alex.
[01:38:23.291 --> 01:38:27.274]  I wanted to comment on this video with Mark Dice that you're talking about.
[01:38:27.315 --> 01:38:28.796]  But first of all, I wanted to ask you,
[01:38:29.529 --> 01:38:44.263]  Uh, you've done, just done a bunch of interviews with Steve Pchenik, who is with Delta Force, and I just wondered if you have ever heard from him or know yourself of anything about John Lear, who was also with Delta Force, and his intel that he's put out on the internet.
[01:38:44.563 --> 01:38:47.726]  You're talking about the son of the inventor of the Learjet, if fortune?
[01:38:48.635 --> 01:38:49.055]  Yes, sir.
[01:38:49.735 --> 01:38:50.476]  Yeah, here's the deal.
[01:38:51.056 --> 01:38:54.517]  I'm not knocking Lear, who says, you know, space aliens and stuff.
[01:38:54.997 --> 01:38:57.958]  I can't prove all that, so I don't go there.
[01:38:58.419 --> 01:39:03.401]  Steve Puchinnik is even more than who he says he is.
[01:39:04.901 --> 01:39:10.223]  And, I mean, he's really an interesting person on so many fronts.
[01:39:14.355 --> 01:39:14.475]  So
[01:39:32.921 --> 01:39:35.302]  Reds in Italy to kill Prime Minister.
[01:39:35.322 --> 01:39:37.623]  I mean, just all sorts of stuff.
[01:39:37.643 --> 01:39:39.584]  Of course, Pucinich will never talk about any of that on air.
[01:39:40.325 --> 01:39:43.466]  But, I mean, Pucinich really is, you know, really did know Kim Jong-il.
[01:39:43.766 --> 01:39:44.967]  He really did know the father.
[01:39:45.027 --> 01:39:47.388]  He really did go into North Korea last week.
[01:39:48.829 --> 01:39:51.090]  I mean, the guy went into North Korea last week.
[01:39:51.510 --> 01:39:54.051]  I mean, he is a more than just, he's a spy.
[01:39:54.071 --> 01:39:56.792]  I mean, but he's the old-fashioned, you know, spy.
[01:39:58.980 --> 01:40:02.665]  And I'm not saying he doesn't even have other motives out there, but overall they don't like what he's doing.
[01:40:02.926 --> 01:40:04.988]  The CFR has been very threatening to him.
[01:40:06.410 --> 01:40:08.153]  He's saying a lot of stuff that's true on the air.
[01:40:09.414 --> 01:40:10.476]  So, there you go.
[01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:34.389]  The reason I ask is because Lear put forth something, and I agree with you, all this stuff about people living on the moon and other planets and stuff, I don't go for that, but he put something that I thought was very plausible, considering the technology that the globalists have, like blue beams, and he stated that he knew that the planes that hit the World Trade Center were actually holographic images
[01:40:35.109 --> 01:40:41.911]  And they were timed from the doomsday plane that was seen flying overhead at the same time when the explosions took place.
[01:40:42.371 --> 01:40:44.691]  I could believe that that actually occurred.
[01:40:45.591 --> 01:40:51.453]  When you look at the video of the planes, it actually kind of looks like they're being absorbed into the buildings rather than flying.
[01:40:51.473 --> 01:40:53.073]  Yeah, you know, here's the deal.
[01:40:53.093 --> 01:40:57.574]  The media always focuses, and I appreciate your call on that, because that's what they want to debate.
[01:40:58.194 --> 01:41:04.617]  They don't want to debate the Carlisle Group meeting with the Bushes on the morning of 9-11 with the head of the House of Bin Laden.
[01:41:05.197 --> 01:41:06.398]  That's London Guardian AP.
[01:41:06.838 --> 01:41:09.459]  They don't want to discuss the hijackers trained at U.S.
[01:41:09.499 --> 01:41:09.939]  bases.
[01:41:10.759 --> 01:41:17.702]  AP, Reuters, San Jose Mercury News, the head of the base went public and said, Colonel Butler, said, all I know is these guys are U.S.
[01:41:17.782 --> 01:41:18.063]  agents.
[01:41:18.883 --> 01:41:21.184]  And there's a cover-up, and this is a double-cross.
[01:41:21.444 --> 01:41:25.826]  Did they land an aircraft at a NASA base with different tail numbers?
[01:41:27.697 --> 01:41:31.039]  And then load the people off and then take back off that match the other jail numbers?
[01:41:31.059 --> 01:41:31.340]  Yes.
[01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:34.062]  Does Operation Northwoods talk about that?
[01:41:34.142 --> 01:41:34.442]  Yes.
[01:41:35.383 --> 01:41:42.408]  Is Blue Beam real to be able to project a 5,000-foot King Kong or Jesus or whatever they want in the hologram?
[01:41:42.428 --> 01:41:42.628]  Yes.
[01:41:42.928 --> 01:41:44.429]  But I don't think they're going to go operational.
[01:41:44.869 --> 01:41:48.312]  See, I don't think that kids didn't really die at New Haven.
[01:41:48.792 --> 01:41:50.053]  They like killing real kids.
[01:41:50.073 --> 01:41:52.496]  They clearly have some actors there to back up the story as well.
[01:41:52.856 --> 01:41:53.637]  It's a composite.
[01:41:53.937 --> 01:41:55.238]  Part of it's real, part of it isn't.
[01:41:55.258 --> 01:41:59.062]  That's very obvious, and that's what other declassified programs look like.
[01:41:59.622 --> 01:42:00.803]  They're gonna kill real kids.
[01:42:00.823 --> 01:42:01.964]  They're gonna kill real people.
[01:42:02.765 --> 01:42:07.249]  Now, was it confirmed the towers were more than half empty that day, what they regularly were?
[01:42:07.289 --> 01:42:07.510]  Yes.
[01:42:09.232 --> 01:42:13.534]  Was it confirmed that basically most people got the word not to go to work that day across the board?
[01:42:14.094 --> 01:42:14.394]  Yes.
[01:42:15.134 --> 01:42:20.857]  So the media turns it into no Jews died conspiracy theory when there were a bunch of Jews died.
[01:42:21.877 --> 01:42:22.737]  In the World Trade Centers.
[01:42:23.397 --> 01:42:35.821]  See, it comes out, the buildings were half-empty, there's all these warnings, it's in local news, yeah, we got warned not to go to work that day, the day before, Mayor Willie Brown comes out, San Francisco Chronicle, I got a call from Condoleezza Rice, told me don't fly to New York tomorrow.
[01:42:37.041 --> 01:42:41.502]  I mean, that came out September 12th.
[01:42:43.243 --> 01:42:45.103]  And then he got told to shut up and wouldn't talk about it.
[01:42:45.983 --> 01:42:48.064]  See, nobody wants to, it's said it's like, oh, Jews!
[01:42:49.329 --> 01:42:51.110]  And people go, oh, you're covering up for the Jews.
[01:42:51.170 --> 01:42:51.550]  No, no.
[01:42:51.590 --> 01:43:01.917]  The media, when all this came out about Willie Brown getting warned and all these other people, and Arabs got warned, that got confirmed, and some companies that did have Jews working at them, you know, some Jews got warned.
[01:43:02.737 --> 01:43:04.858]  When all that came out, it's like, oh, Jews!
[01:43:05.139 --> 01:43:08.901]  People say no Jews died to create a false conspiracy theory.
[01:43:10.745 --> 01:43:15.732]  And again, I don't know exactly what happened on 9-11, but the official story is a fraud.
[01:43:15.772 --> 01:43:20.539]  I mean, look at how our government runs Al-Qaeda in Libya and Syria now, and gave them 10,000 heat-seeking missiles.
[01:43:20.960 --> 01:43:21.381]  On record.
[01:43:22.677 --> 01:43:26.099]  And in a year or two years, when European and U.S.
[01:43:26.159 --> 01:43:45.152]  or English jet airliners get shot down by the heatseekers, it'll be buried in the back of the news that our government gave them the heatseekers, and I'll be pointing out all the reports we did, all the warnings, and it'll be, yeah, Fox News, yeah, Alex is that piece of garbage, or Glenn Beck will say, that says our government, our firefighters, did 9-11.
[01:43:46.373 --> 01:43:50.535]  That was the talking point a few years ago, was Alex says the fire department was in on it.
[01:43:50.555 --> 01:43:51.236]  I never said that.
[01:43:52.518 --> 01:43:53.678]  Alex says Jews did it.
[01:43:53.799 --> 01:43:54.499]  I never said that.
[01:43:55.539 --> 01:43:58.140]  See, I'm like, hey, they gave him 10,000 heatseekers.
[01:43:58.480 --> 01:43:59.601]  Here's the mainstream articles.
[01:43:59.941 --> 01:44:00.801]  This is terrible.
[01:44:01.081 --> 01:44:02.222]  Remember this when it comes out.
[01:44:02.282 --> 01:44:05.903]  And I'll be here with the mainstream articles when it happens, going, see, I told you it'll be.
[01:44:06.243 --> 01:44:07.784]  Shut up, you un-American piece of garbage.
[01:44:11.805 --> 01:44:13.426]  I mean, I called Colonel Butler up.
[01:44:14.537 --> 01:44:19.919]  Called information, the day the news hit, and I said, I'd like you to come on about how Muhammad Atta trained in your class.
[01:44:20.479 --> 01:44:23.700]  He was the dean of the school, and he goes, I can't talk to you, I'm getting threatened.
[01:44:23.960 --> 01:44:28.141]  And I heard a woman in the background going, I told you, and they told you, what are you doing?
[01:44:28.461 --> 01:44:28.761]  Click.
[01:44:30.242 --> 01:44:32.363]  Because they began the court martial of him the next day.
[01:44:32.383 --> 01:44:35.224]  They probably had men in suits in their house right then.
[01:44:35.944 --> 01:44:39.805]  Imagine the colonel, the head of the base is like, five of the hijackers trained.
[01:44:39.825 --> 01:44:42.686]  Atta was in my class, front row, for a year.
[01:44:44.170 --> 01:44:44.911]  Something's going on!
[01:44:44.931 --> 01:44:45.851]  The government's involved!
[01:44:46.031 --> 01:44:47.072]  We gotta warn people!
[01:44:48.253 --> 01:44:50.815]  And I'll bet you bottom dollar, we ought to go try to find Butler.
[01:44:50.955 --> 01:44:52.076]  That's the kind of stuff that gets you killed.
[01:44:53.076 --> 01:44:54.317]  Because of the credibility of that.
[01:44:55.458 --> 01:44:57.639]  And by the way, San Jose Mercury News wasn't controlled.
[01:44:57.900 --> 01:44:59.961]  They reported it right after it happened.
[01:44:59.981 --> 01:45:01.162]  It was like September 15th or something.
[01:45:01.302 --> 01:45:02.183]  They wrote a letter to the editor.
[01:45:05.005 --> 01:45:05.705]  The head of the U.S.
[01:45:05.785 --> 01:45:08.107]  Embassy in Visa Section, Springman,
[01:45:09.690 --> 01:45:17.555]  Tells the Toronto Star, he goes, all I know is we were told give them visas because the CIA was really controlling them and they weren't really Al Qaeda.
[01:45:18.655 --> 01:45:21.116]  See, you bring up these points and I said I'd go to your calls.
[01:45:21.216 --> 01:45:22.396]  It's so crazy.
[01:45:22.496 --> 01:45:24.876]  Ladies and gentlemen, crime syndicates.
[01:45:25.236 --> 01:45:27.217]  The New World Order is a global banking mafia.
[01:45:27.277 --> 01:45:28.057]  They are a mafia.
[01:45:28.277 --> 01:45:29.377]  They have private hitmen.
[01:45:30.057 --> 01:45:32.318]  These banks are bigger than most countries' GDP.
[01:45:32.558 --> 01:45:33.578]  They have their own armies.
[01:45:33.638 --> 01:45:35.459]  They run the private intelligence networks.
[01:45:35.779 --> 01:45:37.039]  They can listen to your phones.
[01:45:37.339 --> 01:45:43.000]  They've got 800,000 private contractors with subcontractor companies of the big banks that listen to your phones.
[01:45:43.040 --> 01:45:44.461]  They administer the welfare checks.
[01:45:44.701 --> 01:45:45.361]  They run it all.
[01:45:45.421 --> 01:45:46.121]  They're the government.
[01:45:47.129 --> 01:45:52.413]  They're dissolving the old government, having a new privatized government, not privatized for bids.
[01:45:52.453 --> 01:45:53.954]  These are no-bid privatized.
[01:45:56.616 --> 01:46:01.780]  And they are telling the police and military, prepare to arrest Christians en masse.
[01:46:03.662 --> 01:46:05.283]  That broke last week mainstream news.
[01:46:06.404 --> 01:46:11.848]  And finally, the normalcy bias of the state police and sheriffs in Colorado are like,
[01:46:13.364 --> 01:46:20.547]  You're teaching us that Christians are terrorists and we're going to have to arrest them en masse and there's going to be a Christian uprising?
[01:46:20.647 --> 01:46:22.928]  That sounds like Russia or something.
[01:46:23.388 --> 01:46:23.908]  What is it?
[01:46:23.948 --> 01:46:27.629]  We better... Yeah, you better get up off your butts, folks!
[01:46:32.051 --> 01:46:35.252]  The spirit of evil is moving across the country right now.
[01:46:37.104 --> 01:46:38.405]  Yeah, that's Fox News, guys.
[01:46:38.425 --> 01:46:42.568]  Pull up the one from Infowars that links to the newspapers in Colorado.
[01:46:42.588 --> 01:46:48.452]  The headline was State Police, you know, trained to confiscate guns from Christians.
[01:46:49.533 --> 01:46:53.936]  That's got the letters from the state police and others just freaking out going, what planet do we live on?
[01:46:54.276 --> 01:46:56.918]  Well, I'll tell you, you live in authoritarianism.
[01:46:58.659 --> 01:46:59.880]  And again, I'm freaking out.
[01:47:00.420 --> 01:47:02.342]  I'm not even having an anxiety attack right now.
[01:47:03.556 --> 01:47:05.917]  I just feel like I shouldn't even, in a weird way, even be on air.
[01:47:06.598 --> 01:47:08.499]  I mean, I just can't even believe this anymore.
[01:47:09.159 --> 01:47:16.483]  That illegal aliens are allowed to drink and drive and kill people, and there it is, DHS funded coarse-ass cops and they will confiscate guns from Christians.
[01:47:16.943 --> 01:47:20.225]  Colorado troopers trained to consider Christians as dangerous terrorists.
[01:47:20.505 --> 01:47:22.526]  I mean, now, that came out on April 10th last week.
[01:47:22.766 --> 01:47:23.526]  Print that for me, thanks.
[01:47:24.047 --> 01:47:25.648]  And it just comes out and it's like, oh yeah!
[01:47:26.288 --> 01:47:29.990]  And it's got the letters from the state police and people going, yeah, this is really creepy.
[01:47:35.060 --> 01:47:35.620]  God help me.
[01:47:37.882 --> 01:47:40.583]  And I'm telling you, the enemy's gonna come after us however they can.
[01:47:42.224 --> 01:47:44.885]  It's by the grace of God and your prayers we're even on the air right now.
[01:47:46.386 --> 01:47:53.890]  I mean, I just hope you know, folks, I am directly at the gate of the Dragon's Den with a sword, stabbing him in the belly right now, okay?
[01:47:53.910 --> 01:47:56.252]  And I'm little and I'm weak, but the idea is powerful.
[01:47:57.248 --> 01:48:00.429]  And I just, my, my flesh isn't even afraid.
[01:48:00.469 --> 01:48:04.349]  It's more like, uh, I mean, I can't even believe we're in this situation.
[01:48:04.629 --> 01:48:07.110]  I can't believe everybody else is just going around like it's normal.
[01:48:11.031 --> 01:48:15.271]  Every instinct I've got is just get my family and get the hell out of here right now.
[01:48:16.092 --> 01:48:18.452]  But I'm telling you folks, that way is destruction.
[01:48:18.732 --> 01:48:21.613]  We've gotten in this position by, oh, I'm not going to say anything.
[01:48:21.633 --> 01:48:22.573]  What will my neighbors think?
[01:48:22.693 --> 01:48:23.873]  Oh, I'm not going to get involved.
[01:48:26.756 --> 01:48:28.700]  Uh, let's talk to David in Pennsylvania.
[01:48:28.720 --> 01:48:29.522]  Thanks for holding, David.
[01:48:29.542 --> 01:48:31.285]  Then we'll go to Danny, Ramone, William, and others.
[01:48:31.625 --> 01:48:32.507]  You're on the air, David.
[01:48:32.527 --> 01:48:32.848]  Welcome.
[01:48:34.010 --> 01:48:34.431]  Hey, Alex.
[01:48:34.491 --> 01:48:34.952]  How are you?
[01:48:35.573 --> 01:48:37.557]  I just am watching the fall of America.
[01:48:37.597 --> 01:48:38.999]  It's like a Twilight Zone episode.
[01:48:40.072 --> 01:48:41.093]  I hear you, I hear you.
[01:48:41.193 --> 01:48:50.999]  I started listening to you three years ago, and when I started telling my neighbors and people about what you said, you know, they would think I was crazy, a lunatic.
[01:48:51.219 --> 01:48:57.883]  But what's strange is a lot of people agree now that nobody seems to want to do anything.
[01:48:57.903 --> 01:48:59.705]  I mean, I called my senator.
[01:49:00.955 --> 01:49:06.778]  And I even called Martinez down there when I saw that video on your website.
[01:49:07.599 --> 01:49:08.559]  But what do we do?
[01:49:17.324 --> 01:49:21.668]  You know, uh, you know, look like heroes, those pro-gun guys that were there.
[01:49:21.708 --> 01:49:35.020]  Just looking in the eyes, smart, look manly, just obviously good guys, got signs saying, you know, no to gun ban, and they assault them, and the cops act like they're bad, and then Martinez laughs at them and says, we're gonna register your guns and then we're gonna take them.
[01:49:35.440 --> 01:49:42.527]  Austin City Council Member, Mike Martinez.
[01:49:42.547 --> 01:49:43.087]  Thank you so much.
[01:49:44.895 --> 01:49:51.058]  I've got a proclamation on behalf of the Mayor and City Council that we want to present, but I want to say a couple of words, and I'll be brief.
[01:49:51.838 --> 01:49:58.121]  First of all, to the gentleman that's dying for attention, someone needs to inform him that there is no gun ban currently.
[01:49:58.441 --> 01:50:05.164]  But, because of the work that we're doing here today, we will make your side legitimate shortly.
[01:50:05.264 --> 01:50:07.105]  So you hang on to that.
[01:50:10.326 --> 01:50:14.108]  And again they cheer, and while this is happening, a woman comes up and hits him
[01:50:16.721 --> 01:50:25.390]  With her, not a complete fist, she had like, you know, her knuckles, it's almost like how a monkey hits people, a chimpanzee.
[01:50:25.710 --> 01:50:35.600]  She throws her hand out and hits him with the middle of her fingers, and you can tell he pops them, and she pops them pretty hard and he turns around, and then another guy runs in, they're like roaches.
[01:50:35.620 --> 01:50:38.763]  I mean, Martina says that, you want some attention, buddy?
[01:50:38.783 --> 01:50:40.204]  And they just run in like roaches.
[01:50:41.135 --> 01:50:42.055]  I'm going to come back to you, caller.
[01:50:42.075 --> 01:50:42.936]  I'm going to come back.
[01:50:43.036 --> 01:50:43.656]  Don't hang up, David.
[01:50:43.676 --> 01:50:44.636]  I want to hear what you have to say.
[01:50:45.357 --> 01:50:47.838]  And again, it's just there's such flaming authoritarians.
[01:50:47.918 --> 01:50:52.520]  And Martinez, if you don't see the video as a radio listener, it's on InfoWars.com.
[01:50:52.900 --> 01:50:54.240]  There's this craziness.
[01:50:55.501 --> 01:50:59.502]  We'll get your guns because he sees us as his food, as his property.
[01:51:02.930 --> 01:51:03.410]  For only $99!
[01:51:04.211 --> 01:51:12.857]  At 30dayfoodsupply.com, you can purchase Oregon Trail Foods' one-month supply of high-quality, nutritious, and healthy emergency meals for less than $100.
[01:51:13.077 --> 01:51:20.162]  These vegetarian meals are natural, high in carbs and protein, and are packed with oxygen absorbers and Mylar pouches.
[01:51:20.342 --> 01:51:20.943]  They take up to 70
[01:51:24.349 --> 01:51:24.950]  I think so.
[01:51:39.787 --> 01:51:40.667]  We're good to go!
[01:51:59.597 --> 01:52:00.357]  Breaking news!
[01:52:00.517 --> 01:52:07.999]  Harry Reid and the Democrats in the Senate are getting ready to pass a sweeping new gun control bill that will take away your constitutional right to keep and bear arms.
[01:52:08.240 --> 01:52:18.583]  Conservatives in the Senate, led by Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, and Marco Rubio, have promised to do everything they can to keep this dangerous bill from becoming law, even if they have to filibuster it day and night.
[01:52:18.783 --> 01:52:22.024]  These principled leaders refuse to compromise with President Obama.
[01:52:22.184 --> 01:52:26.765]  They have committed to fight the gun-grabbing liberals in the Senate, but they need your help to succeed.
[01:52:27.065 --> 01:52:28.726]  You can support them by calling today.
[01:52:28.926 --> 01:52:36.569]  Please call 1-800-996-4229 and sign the official Senate Conservatives petition to pledge your support for the Second Amendment.
[01:52:36.689 --> 01:52:37.930]  This could be your last chance.
[01:52:38.150 --> 01:52:46.654]  So please call 1-800-996-4229 to support Senators Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, and Marco Rubio in the fight for our freedoms.
[01:52:46.934 --> 01:52:50.496]  Please call 1-800-996-4229 today.
[01:52:50.696 --> 01:52:51.296]  That's 1-800-996-4229.

[01:53:00.200 --> 01:53:06.023]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our immunity and health.
[01:53:06.954 --> 01:53:12.841]  At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of silver-based products.

[01:53:24.640 --> 01:53:27.923]  Just released is our 100% natural silver gel.
[01:53:28.783 --> 01:53:35.008]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.
[01:53:35.709 --> 01:53:46.117]  But rather, we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera, to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin, while delivering the silver more effectively.

[01:54:07.080 --> 01:54:12.402]  Hi, Richard Belzer, who's got a new book out, just finished, that we also sell at infowarestore.com.
[01:54:12.422 --> 01:54:18.584]  Hit list, an in-depth investigation into the mysterious deaths of witnesses to the JFK assassination.
[01:54:18.624 --> 01:54:20.245]  This is the most compelling evidence.
[01:54:20.825 --> 01:54:26.527]  Because you can make up stuff about magic bullets and stuff, you know, with ignorant people, but what about all the people that were murdered?
[01:54:27.407 --> 01:54:28.288]  It's hundreds of them.
[01:54:29.169 --> 01:54:31.471]  More than 50 where it's just incredibly obvious.
[01:54:32.632 --> 01:54:38.738]  I mean, within weeks, murdered to keep the official story floating for a while.
[01:54:39.258 --> 01:54:43.222]  So that's going to be coming up in about the eight after.
[01:54:43.242 --> 01:54:44.463]  We're going to take calls right now.
[01:54:45.064 --> 01:54:45.965]  David, finish your point.
[01:54:45.985 --> 01:54:46.385]  I'm sorry.
[01:54:46.465 --> 01:54:46.966]  We went to that.
[01:54:47.666 --> 01:54:55.310]  Uh, clip of the gun grabber saying, after we're registered, you know, the work they're doing now, that you'll need your sign, don't ban the guns, so keep that sign, you're gonna need that.
[01:54:55.590 --> 01:54:56.231]  Ha ha ha!
[01:54:56.931 --> 01:54:59.953]  I mean, it's just incredible how disingenuous most of them are.
[01:54:59.973 --> 01:55:03.475]  At least he was honest about the fact that he'll have armed guards, but you won't.
[01:55:04.135 --> 01:55:06.076]  That's, that's how, that's how they roll.
[01:55:06.857 --> 01:55:09.018]  But go ahead, David, make your point from Pennsylvania.
[01:55:10.031 --> 01:55:16.359]  Well, the point I was trying to make is since they always turn it around on us, I mean, how do we ultimately win?
[01:55:16.380 --> 01:55:26.233]  I mean, we keep talking and talking, and I agree with you, the one who takes the first shot loses, but at the end, how do we turn this around?
[01:55:27.694 --> 01:55:30.676]  Well, number one, they're going to stage stuff and say we took the first shot.
[01:55:30.716 --> 01:55:33.398]  They'll find a federal building with a daycare again and blow it up.
[01:55:33.418 --> 01:55:35.740]  There's no doubt that was a federal operation.
[01:55:35.760 --> 01:55:38.822]  I'm in the film, and I endorse it.
[01:55:38.882 --> 01:55:39.643]  Very powerful.
[01:55:39.703 --> 01:55:46.968]  It's got police officers that were witnesses to the government operation who were death-threatened, living cops, not the cops they were able to kill, like Terrence Yakey.
[01:55:46.988 --> 01:55:49.130]  They got Mr. Browning, Don Browning, and others in there.
[01:55:50.310 --> 01:55:57.815]  I imagine the head of the K-9 unit, a Marine veteran of Vietnam, and he's told, we're going to kill you and your wife if you don't shut up about what you saw, boy.
[01:55:57.835 --> 01:55:59.475]  One of the first guys to show up.
[01:55:59.976 --> 01:56:00.536]  How's that sound?
[01:56:01.897 --> 01:56:03.738]  I mean, you're right, we blew that up, buddy.
[01:56:03.958 --> 01:56:05.459]  Now you keep your mouth shut or you're dead.
[01:56:05.779 --> 01:56:11.202]  And by the way, when I got him to talk about that first on radio and then in that film, he was gulping on air when he did it.
[01:56:11.742 --> 01:56:14.844]  Because, you know, even a combat veteran is like, okay.
[01:56:15.484 --> 01:56:17.886]  Because he cares about the truth and those kids they killed.
[01:56:18.547 --> 01:56:20.089]  You think it's fun doing this, folks?
[01:56:20.289 --> 01:56:21.130]  You think it's fun?
[01:56:21.511 --> 01:56:27.238]  All the egomaniacs and narcissists out there that think they're patriots, who all they do is infight and stuff all day?
[01:56:27.479 --> 01:56:30.042]  This is a life-and-death situation.
[01:56:30.422 --> 01:56:31.444]  This isn't a game.
[01:56:31.824 --> 01:56:35.008]  And they're gonna fire first by blowing stuff up and saying, we did it.
[01:56:35.469 --> 01:56:38.510]  That's why we've got to expose who really does the Fast and Furious.
[01:56:38.730 --> 01:56:39.931]  And of course they did Aurora.
[01:56:40.111 --> 01:56:41.591]  And of course they're up to their eyeballs.
[01:56:42.231 --> 01:56:53.415]  I mean, shooters in the same outfit from nearby hostage team, SWAT teams from nearby federal special unit, local police who were federal special event police, caught in the woods.
[01:56:53.635 --> 01:56:54.515]  It wasn't just one.
[01:56:54.755 --> 01:56:55.576]  It wasn't just two.
[01:56:55.776 --> 01:56:56.996]  There were three of them seen.
[01:56:57.276 --> 01:56:58.197]  One of them arrested!
[01:56:58.457 --> 01:57:04.679]  And then they tried to cover it up and say it didn't exist, even though it was confirmed in the police reports and we have chopper video.
[01:57:05.791 --> 01:57:06.212]  Okay?
[01:57:06.272 --> 01:57:07.754]  I mean, we're in trouble, folks!
[01:57:08.315 --> 01:57:09.556]  They grace little kids!
[01:57:09.797 --> 01:57:10.137]  Boom!
[01:57:10.197 --> 01:57:10.938]  Right in the head!
[01:57:11.399 --> 01:57:12.260]  To get our guns.
[01:57:12.320 --> 01:57:13.101]  Isn't it obvious?
[01:57:13.462 --> 01:57:14.042]  I'm sorry, sir.
[01:57:14.082 --> 01:57:14.543]  Go ahead.
[01:57:16.025 --> 01:57:16.486]  You're right.
[01:57:16.706 --> 01:57:18.008]  It's unbelievable.
[01:57:19.042 --> 01:57:20.803]  I'll stay in with you, too, and my friends.
[01:57:21.423 --> 01:57:21.723]  Yes, sir.
[01:57:21.803 --> 01:57:22.143]  Thank you.
[01:57:48.479 --> 01:57:55.745]  And you talk about how the FBI came to your office and said you and your wife would be killed if you didn't shut up.
[01:57:56.145 --> 01:57:58.968]  And he tells the story and I go, okay, go ahead and tell me the names.
[01:57:59.808 --> 01:58:00.169]  Listen!
[01:58:01.547 --> 01:58:03.790]  There is a God, and I'm in God's hands.
[01:58:03.830 --> 01:58:04.511]  You understand that?
[01:58:04.571 --> 01:58:06.573]  And that's why everyone marvels at this show.
[01:58:06.914 --> 01:58:08.396]  No one can believe we're on the air.
[01:58:08.716 --> 01:58:10.198]  No one can believe this is happening.
[01:58:10.398 --> 01:58:11.580]  How could Alex be real?
[01:58:11.800 --> 01:58:13.662]  Because, you know, it's impossible.
[01:58:14.243 --> 01:58:16.045]  Because people can't handle their own fear.
[01:58:17.147 --> 01:58:19.330]  Other media people can't handle their own fear.
[01:58:21.087 --> 01:58:21.467]  You understand?
[01:58:21.507 --> 01:58:22.468]  They can't imagine.
[01:58:22.508 --> 01:58:23.589]  There are good police.
[01:58:23.629 --> 01:58:24.590]  There are good military.
[01:58:24.791 --> 01:58:26.152]  There are good people in media.
[01:58:26.913 --> 01:58:32.017]  And it shows there's still good people in America that we're on over 150 AM and FM affiliates.
[01:58:32.998 --> 01:58:33.299]  Okay?
[01:58:33.359 --> 01:58:37.543]  We can turn the tide, folks, but this is the most hardcore tyranny the world's ever seen.
[01:58:37.563 --> 01:58:38.363]  We've got to fight it.
[01:58:40.345 --> 01:58:41.687]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:58:49.798 --> 01:58:56.783]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[01:58:57.023 --> 01:59:14.655]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[01:59:14.915 --> 01:59:19.018]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[01:59:19.498 --> 01:59:28.925]  The longevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[01:59:29.225 --> 01:59:35.489]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months, simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.

[02:00:16.663 --> 02:00:20.806]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:29.510 --> 02:00:33.653]  Alright, let's continue with your phone calls and also get to you with Richard Belzer coming up.
[02:00:35.384 --> 02:00:37.326]  If we give in to the bullies, they're going to take everything.
[02:00:37.346 --> 02:00:38.807]  The only chance is fighting back.
[02:00:38.827 --> 02:00:39.727]  Have you figured that out yet?
[02:00:41.569 --> 02:00:44.591]  That's why they're going after whistleblowers everywhere, because that can bring them down.
[02:00:46.193 --> 02:00:47.674]  Let's talk to Danny in Tennessee.
[02:00:47.694 --> 02:00:48.634]  You're on the air, Danny.
[02:00:48.655 --> 02:00:48.975]  Welcome.
[02:00:50.848 --> 02:00:51.868]  Can you hear me okay, Alex?
[02:00:51.908 --> 02:00:52.488]  Yes, Danny.
[02:00:53.329 --> 02:00:53.909]  Hey, brother man.
[02:00:54.609 --> 02:01:11.974]  Now, I was wanting to talk to you about what Billy Corgan had suggested to you, which you already have done it, but he was talking to you about that you need to get in touch with people that had ancestors that had been able to survive for the past few thousand years, about like the Native Americans.
[02:01:12.754 --> 02:01:17.595]  Well, my ancestors have survived pretty darn good in founded countries and Texas and you name it.
[02:01:17.695 --> 02:01:23.557]  And I do agree, I want to get other, you know, groups and people on with their perspective and that's the way to reach out.
[02:01:24.297 --> 02:01:26.858]  And that's what I'm trying to do with my message across the political spectrum.
[02:01:26.878 --> 02:01:27.218]  Yes, sir.
[02:01:28.259 --> 02:01:30.399]  Yes, some of my ancestors were from Scotland.
[02:01:30.419 --> 02:01:31.279]  They were Jacobites.
[02:01:31.339 --> 02:01:32.260]  I don't know if you know what that is.
[02:01:32.300 --> 02:01:32.660]  Yes, I do.
[02:01:33.726 --> 02:01:38.771]  Okay, well what I was going to say was, you had already done all this stuff with Russell Means.
[02:01:38.791 --> 02:01:45.377]  You had already had the documentary that you had with Welcome to the Reservation and all that.
[02:01:45.417 --> 02:01:48.020]  You had done, had John Trudell on before.
[02:01:48.040 --> 02:01:54.987]  But what I was going to suggest to you was Alex, was just like what you were saying right before break, where it was like kind of like a spiritual
[02:01:55.763 --> 02:01:59.406]  You're saying like spiritually, you know, it's like real heavy.
[02:01:59.446 --> 02:02:00.227]  I mean, that's it.
[02:02:00.387 --> 02:02:06.271]  I can feel, not just see it manifesting, evil, like rushing out and like possessing people almost.
[02:02:06.511 --> 02:02:13.857]  People are getting crazier, meaner, more backstabbing, more like delusional, where people make up whatever they want to believe.
[02:02:13.877 --> 02:02:16.599]  I mean, it's just, I mean, it freaks me out.
[02:02:16.639 --> 02:02:17.780]  I see it on the highways.
[02:02:18.140 --> 02:02:20.882]  I'm sure everybody I talk to is seeing it.
[02:02:20.922 --> 02:02:21.583]  Are you seeing that?
[02:02:23.329 --> 02:02:24.790]  Definitely Alex, definitely.
[02:02:24.830 --> 02:02:33.576]  But what I was going to say was when you were talking to Billy, you were talking about going up to that next mountaintop and how you're kind of like screaming into the side of the mountain right now with your broadcast.
[02:02:33.736 --> 02:02:36.538]  Not a lot of people are awake and can understand and hear.
[02:02:37.138 --> 02:02:38.059]  But if you recall,
[02:02:38.951 --> 02:02:45.517]  Back to that first interview with Russell Means, and anyone that's listening right now, you can go to Alex Jones' YouTube channel and listen to this.
[02:02:45.537 --> 02:02:47.078]  He has a playlist with Russell Means.
[02:02:47.459 --> 02:02:51.623]  Alex, do you remember, like, how awesome that first interview was with Russell Means?
[02:02:51.643 --> 02:02:52.904]  Like, how much y'all had in common?
[02:02:52.944 --> 02:02:53.744]  Yeah, no, no, no.
[02:02:53.785 --> 02:02:58.229]  How the whole left and right are controlled, how it's what Obama was going to do, it's like four years ago.
[02:02:59.249 --> 02:03:00.950]  Uh, and, uh, absolutely.
[02:03:00.970 --> 02:03:03.852]  People say, Russell Means, he's the big anti, you know, whatever.
[02:03:03.912 --> 02:03:08.635]  He's a guy that really grew a lot of courage with the big sieges at Wounded Knee, the rest of it.
[02:03:08.975 --> 02:03:14.919]  He was demonized by the Native American groups because they were COINTELPRO and jealous of him, basically.
[02:03:15.359 --> 02:03:18.961]  And, I mean, nobody's perfect, but, I mean, I talked a lot with Russell Means on and off the air.
[02:03:19.001 --> 02:03:22.023]  We went to the Dakotas to interview him, and he was the real deal.
[02:03:22.983 --> 02:03:25.404]  And he's dead now, but his information lives on.
[02:03:25.424 --> 02:03:35.387]  And he grew a lot, and became a constitutionalist and a libertarian, and really transcended, you know, kind of the fake leftist-ism.
[02:03:36.047 --> 02:03:39.148]  But that's why they tried to cover all that up and assassinate his name.
[02:03:39.868 --> 02:03:50.411]  And if they kill me, folks, that's the first thing they'll do, is either try to assassinate my character first, then kill me, or imprison me, or kill me and then assassinate my character.
[02:03:50.851 --> 02:03:53.273]  Because, you know, money, you can get people to say anything you want.
[02:03:53.793 --> 02:03:54.414]  And it doesn't matter.
[02:03:54.434 --> 02:03:55.395]  Just remember, you're good.
[02:03:55.635 --> 02:03:56.576]  You know what's good.
[02:03:56.996 --> 02:03:57.877]  You know the truth.
[02:03:58.497 --> 02:03:59.658]  You are a good person.
[02:03:59.738 --> 02:04:00.919]  Stand up and fight tyranny.
[02:04:01.280 --> 02:04:03.061]  Don't let them trick you into infighting.
[02:04:03.882 --> 02:04:05.563]  And also, and I just, God has hit me.
[02:04:05.824 --> 02:04:06.904]  Talk about being convicted.
[02:04:07.885 --> 02:04:10.387]  Because I've always, you know, taken the high road with stuff.
[02:04:10.848 --> 02:04:13.790]  But sometimes I get, you know, a little nasty, like with Glenn Beck and stuff and other things.
[02:04:14.451 --> 02:04:16.572]  I have just decided, and have totally been convicted.
[02:04:19.248 --> 02:04:39.524]  For people that don't know, that means by God, not convicted of a crime, that I need to just absolutely turn it all loose and also redouble my efforts, but also just completely trust in God and transcend all of the narcissism, all of the ego, all of it, because we need to all realize how real all this is.
[02:04:40.245 --> 02:04:46.050]  I mean, this is so real, folks, and we're, as bad as things are, we're on the edge of just a cauldron.
[02:04:46.910 --> 02:04:53.941]  of psychopaths and sociopaths and control freaks and weirdos that want to run rampant in society.
[02:04:54.362 --> 02:04:56.125]  We'll be right back with more calls and our guests.
[02:04:56.145 --> 02:04:56.606]  Stay with us.
[02:05:00.211 --> 02:05:08.474]  Devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, or the threat of martial law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies.
[02:05:08.755 --> 02:05:12.196]  As a result, millions are stockpiling food, gold, and weapons.

[02:06:03.880 --> 02:06:04.780]  Tyranny is here.
[02:06:05.120 --> 02:06:08.701]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:06:09.001 --> 02:06:11.282]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:06:11.302 --> 02:06:16.743]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:06:17.163 --> 02:06:23.444]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:06:23.824 --> 02:06:29.365]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:06:29.785 --> 02:06:33.486]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.

[02:06:44.209 --> 02:06:47.170]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:06:47.771 --> 02:06:49.191]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:06:49.731 --> 02:06:50.251]  It's here.

[02:08:12.188 --> 02:08:18.219]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[02:08:27.270 --> 02:08:30.651]  Well, he's been in scores of different TV shows and movies.
[02:08:31.191 --> 02:08:34.972]  Probably best known for Law & Order, Special Victims Unit, Richard Belzer.
[02:08:35.352 --> 02:08:37.053]  And I like getting him on because he's a funny guy.
[02:08:37.533 --> 02:08:42.315]  Plus, you know, who else shows up to the show with Christopher Walken before?
[02:08:42.335 --> 02:08:46.236]  It's like, here's Christopher Walken, and then he sits down right next to him off the chart.
[02:08:46.756 --> 02:08:49.757]  But Walken just wanted to talk about recipes, chicken recipes.
[02:08:51.702 --> 02:08:56.583]  And we're hearing his new book, which I think is one of the best JFK books out there.
[02:08:56.983 --> 02:08:57.703]  It just came out.
[02:08:57.923 --> 02:08:59.604]  It's available at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:09:00.204 --> 02:09:12.866]  But the reason I think it's important is I've told people if we make a JFK film, which I've been doing for eight years with footage, you kind of get obsessed with it when you work on it and then never put out the final product because there's just so many things to cover, so much proof.
[02:09:13.427 --> 02:09:15.467]  You know, debunking the debunkers, it's ridiculous.
[02:09:16.267 --> 02:09:19.868]  But the biggest smoking gun is the hundreds of people
[02:09:20.928 --> 02:09:26.389]  Murdered, tortured, killed, you name it, who were witnesses or were connected to the JFK assassination.
[02:09:26.429 --> 02:09:27.509]  That's the real proof.
[02:09:28.689 --> 02:09:30.510]  You see, it's like the gun control thing.
[02:09:30.930 --> 02:09:34.410]  You can hear the argument for background checks, the argument for mentally ill people.
[02:09:34.610 --> 02:09:36.691]  The problem is the government wants the guns to control us.
[02:09:36.911 --> 02:09:38.531]  They're buying millions of rounds of ammo.
[02:09:38.991 --> 02:09:40.251]  They're buying armored vehicles.
[02:09:40.611 --> 02:09:41.492]  That's the issue.
[02:09:42.092 --> 02:09:45.532]  You know, Dianne Feinstein laughs and says, yeah, of course I'm going to take the guns after we register them.
[02:09:45.972 --> 02:09:49.293]  You know, Mike Martinez in Austin, the city council says, yeah, we're going to register them and confiscate.
[02:09:49.963 --> 02:09:51.745]  You go out and talk to Californians on the street.
[02:09:51.805 --> 02:09:52.566]  We've got the video.
[02:09:52.586 --> 02:09:54.629]  It's up at Infowars.com right now.
[02:09:55.029 --> 02:09:57.292]  They say, yeah, we need to arrest gun owners.
[02:09:58.253 --> 02:10:01.697]  I mean, it's just this demonization like, we killed the kids at Sandy Hook.
[02:10:02.418 --> 02:10:07.524]  My whole point is, if you have a military industrial complex, the Second Amendment is the check and the balance on that.
[02:10:08.902 --> 02:10:12.970]  That's my point, and I get, you know, real liberals who are like anti-war.
[02:10:13.351 --> 02:10:14.894]  I get not wanting to kill things.
[02:10:15.014 --> 02:10:19.724]  I even used to be a big hunter, and I think if you butcher it and actually eat it, it's good, but I don't just like to kill things.
[02:10:20.740 --> 02:10:26.863]  But I also think it's more humane to go get a hamburger you just eat and then criticize somebody who actually goes out and butchers the cow themselves.
[02:10:26.883 --> 02:10:33.846]  They've tried to shut down Discovery Channel shows where it shows like Amish and people, you know, that actually raise their own cattle and butcher them and everything.
[02:10:33.866 --> 02:10:35.607]  It's like, that's so mean, they killed the cow.
[02:10:36.247 --> 02:10:39.449]  Well, it's ten times more humane than how they kill them at slaughterhouses.
[02:10:39.909 --> 02:10:40.990]  My point is, is that
[02:10:41.750 --> 02:10:43.994]  People say, oh, you're liberal, you're anti-GMO.
[02:10:44.134 --> 02:10:44.334]  No.
[02:10:44.835 --> 02:10:51.044]  All the major GMO crops that are cross-species and grow their own pesticide absolutely kill the rodents it's fed to.
[02:10:51.826 --> 02:10:52.927]  And you look at what's happening to us.
[02:10:53.107 --> 02:10:54.409]  I'm pro-common sense.
[02:10:56.189 --> 02:11:00.052]  I didn't get Belzer on about gun stuff because I know he's in the middle of the road on that.
[02:11:00.873 --> 02:11:04.936]  It's just all this stuff's happening up at PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com right now.
[02:11:05.297 --> 02:11:07.859]  Californians signed a petition to ban and confiscate firearms.
[02:11:08.179 --> 02:11:12.663]  I keep harping on that because people need to know they're going to take all the guns they have everywhere else.
[02:11:12.963 --> 02:11:13.884]  Let's be honest about it.
[02:11:14.344 --> 02:11:17.608]  Obama supporters sign petition to ban free speech.
[02:11:18.249 --> 02:11:21.153]  A new article out with video of that happening.
[02:11:21.193 --> 02:11:23.736]  Obama supporters sign petition to ban free speech.
[02:11:24.517 --> 02:11:29.783]  Illegal immigrant DUI killer ruled incompetent because his unique cultural background.
[02:11:30.524 --> 02:11:34.327]  Republicans support gun bill as Senator warns of loopholes.
[02:11:35.347 --> 02:11:39.250]  U.S.-backed FAS rebels decapitate and grill victim.
[02:11:39.390 --> 02:11:40.451]  I'm not kidding, the U.N.
[02:11:40.471 --> 02:11:41.251]  always does that, too.
[02:11:41.611 --> 02:11:42.372]  Type in U.N.
[02:11:42.412 --> 02:11:44.753]  grilling children, you'll get the photos in newspapers.
[02:11:44.793 --> 02:11:45.494]  I'm not joking.
[02:11:46.314 --> 02:11:48.736]  Hacked photos show Colin Powell at Bohemian Grove.
[02:11:49.657 --> 02:11:52.198]  Big sis coordinating gun confiscations.
[02:11:52.218 --> 02:11:52.939]  That's confirmed.
[02:11:53.579 --> 02:11:55.380]  She's the one ordering the persecution of the vets.
[02:11:55.460 --> 02:11:58.883]  I mean, like they're Jews in Nazi Germany, folks, when they go after a group,
[02:11:59.639 --> 02:12:00.419]  You know you're in danger.
[02:12:00.719 --> 02:12:10.162]  I'm going to get into all of that with Belzer and I promise William and Ramon and Chad and Nick and Brendan, all of you are holding, but he can talk about any subject.
[02:12:10.403 --> 02:12:12.403]  We're going to talk JFK for the first 20 minutes or so.
[02:12:12.863 --> 02:12:22.427]  Hit list, an in-depth investigation into the mysterious deaths of witnesses to the JFK assassination, available at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:12:22.467 --> 02:12:23.487]  It's just coming out.
[02:12:23.987 --> 02:12:26.308]  His last book on JFK became a New York Times bestseller.
[02:12:27.148 --> 02:12:29.150]  It isn't about even the money with this.
[02:12:29.210 --> 02:12:32.494]  I mean, obviously buying it from us funds our operation, but books are a very small part of it.
[02:12:32.814 --> 02:12:35.177]  It's about having a tool to wake people up.
[02:12:35.317 --> 02:12:38.420]  And again, this is my pet project.
[02:12:38.480 --> 02:12:39.821]  I didn't even tell Belzer this.
[02:12:41.904 --> 02:12:47.309]  I think, and I've told people privately and on air, that I believe the murders of the witnesses is the key.
[02:12:48.170 --> 02:12:56.792]  And, you know, a lot of JFK researchers also know that, but this book is extremely hard-hitting and extremely well-documented.
[02:12:56.832 --> 02:13:15.916]  It's my favorite type of read, with like factoid data pages every other page, neurotically demonizing, showing what the globalists are doing, how they demonized people that spoke out, how they killed them, just neurotically documenting everything, the people that were killed.
[02:13:16.977 --> 02:13:17.398]  All of it.
[02:13:17.438 --> 02:13:19.180]  So they also assassinated people's character.
[02:13:19.220 --> 02:13:20.762]  They didn't just kill people physically.
[02:13:21.202 --> 02:13:29.813]  And so joining us to talk about Richard Belzer with David Wayne, Hit List, an in-depth investigation into the mysterious deaths of witnesses to the JFK assassination.
[02:13:30.334 --> 02:13:32.116]  He joins us now via video Skype.
[02:13:32.637 --> 02:13:34.359]  And good to have you back on with us, Richard.
[02:13:34.964 --> 02:13:36.586]  Alex, I miss you.
[02:13:36.606 --> 02:13:38.387]  I haven't spoken to you in a long time.
[02:13:39.708 --> 02:13:51.699]  I must say that your programming, your documentaries, your news shows, those interviews have helped me in my research and I greatly appreciate it.
[02:13:51.839 --> 02:13:59.646]  And I want you to always take care of yourself and stay safe, my friend, because we're, as you say, we're trading in some dangerous waters now because
[02:14:00.507 --> 02:14:06.511]  Uh, I have a former FBI agent who I interviewed, I won't name him, but he said, I have no theories, I just have facts.
[02:14:07.091 --> 02:14:15.037]  And that's why, um, I'm so proud of the last two books I did, because I used to be a journalist, I've written novels, and, you know, I'm a comedian, I'm an actor.
[02:14:15.777 --> 02:14:21.602]  I'm obsessed with the recent history of our country, at least since World War I, and what has happened.
[02:14:21.982 --> 02:14:24.384]  And I just want to read one quick thing, if I may, Alex.
[02:14:24.844 --> 02:14:33.491]  History will not absolve us if we do not, once and for all, reveal all that is known about the greatest, most tragic murder mystery in American history.
[02:14:33.951 --> 02:14:38.454]  After all, 90% of the American people believe that there was a conspiracy to assassinate John F. Kennedy.
[02:14:38.915 --> 02:14:41.276]  The other 10% work for the government or the media.
[02:14:42.117 --> 02:14:43.799]  This book is dedicated to the 90%.
[02:14:44.980 --> 02:14:53.867]  May you forever question, hold accountable, and improve the great gift from our forebearers, what historians have called our experiment in democracy.
[02:14:54.168 --> 02:14:58.631]  Let us all join in this quest to preserve the very soul of our nation.
[02:14:59.132 --> 02:15:06.178]  And I think, Alex, you are in this small brigade, I hope it's getting bigger, of just, I know you don't make anything up.
[02:15:06.378 --> 02:15:07.099]  It's the truth.
[02:15:07.299 --> 02:15:09.341]  You know, that's why I don't write fiction anymore.
[02:15:10.643 --> 02:15:24.512]  Well Richard, it's great having you with us, and when I talk about the fact that this is dangerous, it's still dangerous for JFK investigators, and it's dangerous for journalists that talk to whistleblowers.
[02:15:24.532 --> 02:15:28.535]  They're now arresting journalists, as you know, at record levels.
[02:15:28.575 --> 02:15:30.797]  Government people that report crimes are being arrested.
[02:15:32.058 --> 02:15:44.073]  Yeah, there's a documentary coming out I think this week, Alex, about Obama and how he is going after whistleblowers in a really astounding way.
[02:15:44.314 --> 02:15:48.899]  And boy, you know, this administration is really getting to
[02:15:49.440 --> 02:15:50.361]  You know, scary.
[02:15:50.601 --> 02:15:53.263]  You know, I remember the unicorns and the rainbows when he came in.
[02:15:53.283 --> 02:15:57.546]  And I'm, you know, I'm glad that we, you know, elected a mixed race person.
[02:15:57.626 --> 02:16:00.488]  But, you know, he brought in all the bad bankers.
[02:16:00.508 --> 02:16:06.433]  You know, I wrote a piece in Huffington Post six years ago called It's the Banks, Stupid.
[02:16:07.293 --> 02:16:09.355]  And I talked about reverse bank robbery.
[02:16:09.375 --> 02:16:10.136]  They're robbing us.
[02:16:10.196 --> 02:16:11.036]  We're not robbing them.
[02:16:11.056 --> 02:16:13.759]  You know, in the old days, Dillinger, during the Depression, would rob a bank.
[02:16:13.799 --> 02:16:14.399]  He was a hero.
[02:16:14.940 --> 02:16:16.000]  Now they rob us.
[02:16:16.561 --> 02:16:19.043]  And you're right to keep going back to the banks, Alex.
[02:16:19.083 --> 02:16:21.145]  And I want to tell you something that was pretty chilling today.
[02:16:21.165 --> 02:16:30.473]  I was listening to your show online, and someone was talking about you're getting into the banks, and all of a sudden, beep, beep, beep, beep!
[02:16:30.953 --> 02:16:32.434]  This station is not available.
[02:16:32.454 --> 02:16:33.215]  Try again later.
[02:16:33.235 --> 02:16:34.296]  Now, you know,
[02:16:36.147 --> 02:16:44.529]  People call me paranoid, but... And then, for the last few days, my computer, the cursor, is going to places by itself.
[02:16:45.689 --> 02:16:47.950]  And... Oh yeah, your computer's been hijacked.
[02:16:48.270 --> 02:16:48.790]  Yeah, I'm hip.
[02:16:49.250 --> 02:16:56.152]  So, you know, that's why my friend Chris Walken, he doesn't have a computer, he doesn't have a phone, he's not on any Google Map.
[02:16:56.492 --> 02:16:59.333]  Now I'm realizing how smart he is.
[02:17:00.093 --> 02:17:04.514]  By the way, I'm seriously discussing with my wife getting computers completely out of the house.
[02:17:05.646 --> 02:17:08.147]  We're only coming into work to use them.
[02:17:08.988 --> 02:17:09.968]  Yeah, that's a good idea.
[02:17:10.028 --> 02:17:13.090]  At the very least, tape the camera on your computer.
[02:17:13.890 --> 02:17:15.051]  Always keep that taped.
[02:17:16.176 --> 02:17:18.997]  Oh yeah, they used to call us a conspiracy theorist ten years ago about that.
[02:17:19.057 --> 02:17:21.078]  Now they just admit it.
[02:17:21.098 --> 02:17:21.939]  You're absolutely right.
[02:17:22.439 --> 02:17:26.821]  Why do you think the corruption is just getting so out of control, even compared to what it was?
[02:17:27.181 --> 02:17:29.382]  Or is it that we just know about the corruption now?
[02:17:29.922 --> 02:17:34.204]  No, I think it's a sinking ship and the rats are panicking.
[02:17:34.644 --> 02:17:38.185]  They have had mass mind control on us.
[02:17:38.205 --> 02:17:41.627]  They lied us into World War I and every war thereafter.
[02:17:42.327 --> 02:17:46.269]  Germany didn't lose World War II, they just changed their headquarters from Brooklyn to Washington.
[02:17:46.549 --> 02:17:54.133]  The Dulles brothers helped the Harrimans, the Bushes, Jack Kennedy's father, every rich family.
[02:17:54.553 --> 02:17:59.076]  When Teddy Roosevelt had all this antitrust stuff going on, all the most
[02:17:59.776 --> 02:18:10.238]  Richest families in America all put their money in Germany in the 20s, in part causing our depression, because they thought, hey, you know, they're union crushing and, you know, you can have monopolies.
[02:18:10.558 --> 02:18:16.879]  Then Hitler came in and they still supported Hitler, but then he got a little out of hand, so they had to really go in.
[02:18:17.099 --> 02:18:18.820]  But, you know, we didn't declare war on Germany.
[02:18:19.040 --> 02:18:20.320]  He declared war on us.
[02:18:21.040 --> 02:18:23.361]  Hitler was standing in Paris in 1940.
[02:18:23.421 --> 02:18:24.841]  We still were not at war with them.
[02:18:25.561 --> 02:18:27.342]  It's very, you know... No, that's right.
[02:18:27.362 --> 02:18:31.544]  When Japan declared war on us, he had a treaty and he declared war on us.
[02:18:32.424 --> 02:18:41.469]  Yeah, and he didn't even... he wasn't even... that was really... it's chilling to think, if he didn't, how far he would have gotten.
[02:18:41.849 --> 02:18:45.411]  Because General Motors was building trucks for him throughout the war.
[02:18:45.811 --> 02:18:47.932]  Standard Oil was helping him throughout the
[02:18:48.072 --> 02:18:52.076]  No, that's why he's so arrogant, or was so arrogant, and that's what people don't know.
[02:18:52.857 --> 02:18:56.781]  In 1939, they had Time Magazine saying what a great man he was.
[02:18:57.122 --> 02:19:06.391]  My grandfather, growing up in Dallas, they used to translate on the major Dallas stations Hitler's speeches like the president was speaking when he grew up.
[02:19:06.571 --> 02:19:11.417]  Oh yeah, when he grew up in the mid-30s in Dallas, Hitler was like a celebrity.
[02:19:12.533 --> 02:19:13.775]  That is astounding.
[02:19:14.716 --> 02:19:15.076]  Wow.
[02:19:15.817 --> 02:19:17.418]  But I'm not surprised.
[02:19:17.439 --> 02:19:18.760]  I'm shocked, but I'm not surprised.
[02:19:19.220 --> 02:19:26.968]  No, Alan Dulles and his brother John Foster Dulles, they started their careers at the Treaty of Versailles.
[02:19:27.887 --> 02:19:38.092]  When they chopped up Germany into 18 different places and broke up, you know, regions that normally were together, just setting the stage for World War II.
[02:19:38.112 --> 02:19:40.474]  That treaty, I mean, I'm not a fan of the Nazis.
[02:19:40.514 --> 02:19:41.214]  None of us are.
[02:19:41.354 --> 02:19:42.094]  No, no, absolutely.
[02:19:42.134 --> 02:19:45.696]  But it shows there's a larger hand above it all playing us off against each other.
[02:19:45.736 --> 02:19:46.557]  Richard Belzer, stay there.
[02:19:46.797 --> 02:19:50.839]  I want to get into the book and some of the killings of witnesses.
[02:19:50.879 --> 02:19:54.301]  I mean, why are these people getting killed that were witnesses if there's nothing to cover up?
[02:19:54.861 --> 02:19:55.662]  I mean it's amazing.
[02:19:55.682 --> 02:19:57.124]  We'll be right back with Richard Belzer.
[02:19:57.145 --> 02:19:58.667]  Get the book at Infowarstore.com.
[02:19:59.949 --> 02:20:01.891]  Hey there, my name is Frank Bates.
[02:20:02.352 --> 02:20:05.056]  Do you know the number one most valuable item in a crisis?
[02:20:05.657 --> 02:20:07.419]  Some people think the answer is gold.
[02:20:07.840 --> 02:20:09.082]  Others think it's a gun.
[02:20:09.422 --> 02:20:11.225]  But the correct answer will shock you.
[02:20:11.787 --> 02:20:20.991]  I just created a free video at Crisis123.com that reveals a surprising item that is more valuable than gold in a crisis.
[02:20:21.391 --> 02:20:23.732]  97% of Americans don't have this one critical item.
[02:20:24.013 --> 02:20:25.833]  In fact, they haven't even given it a thought.
[02:20:26.174 --> 02:20:33.157]  And the sad truth is that you may not survive without it when a real crisis hits and a starving mob is right outside your door.
[02:20:33.657 --> 02:20:38.139]  What I have to tell you could literally make the difference between life and death for you and your family.
[02:20:38.641 --> 02:20:44.545]  Watch my video at Crisis123.com to discover the number one most valuable item in a crisis.
[02:20:44.866 --> 02:20:45.646]  You'll be shocked.
[02:20:46.206 --> 02:20:50.930]  See the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in the last three months.
[02:20:51.410 --> 02:20:56.474]  Go watch my video now at Crisis123.com before they force me to shut it down.
[02:20:56.494 --> 02:20:58.255]  Again, that's Crisis123.com.
[02:21:00.023 --> 02:21:07.088]  HempUSA.org has a revolutionary wonder food for detoxing the body and rebuilding the immune system.

[02:21:29.199 --> 02:21:30.260]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:21:30.440 --> 02:21:34.823]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stock workers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:21:35.003 --> 02:21:40.707]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:21:40.807 --> 02:21:44.209]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:21:44.449 --> 02:21:47.051]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:47.171 --> 02:21:52.094]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:21:52.234 --> 02:21:52.455]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:52.475 --> 02:21:53.876]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:21:59.459 --> 02:22:01.380]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[02:22:01.420 --> 02:22:03.321]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[02:22:03.561 --> 02:22:09.003]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[02:22:09.223 --> 02:22:12.984]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[02:22:13.245 --> 02:22:16.986]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[02:22:17.146 --> 02:22:18.327]  The fact is, you are.
[02:22:18.527 --> 02:22:19.307]  We all are.
[02:22:19.547 --> 02:22:21.868]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[02:22:22.168 --> 02:22:30.453]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoodsDirect.
[02:22:30.653 --> 02:22:31.874]  Be prepared before you need it.

[02:22:59.398 --> 02:23:07.664]  Devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, or the threat of martial law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies.
[02:23:07.944 --> 02:23:11.406]  As a result, millions are stockpiling food, gold, and weapons.
[02:23:11.626 --> 02:23:15.789]  But how will these items help if you or one of your loved ones becomes ill?
[02:23:16.089 --> 02:23:20.872]  Supernatural silver is the ultimate tool to prepare you for a medical emergency.
[02:23:21.133 --> 02:23:28.638]  Supernatural silver is a natural antibiotic that is uniquely effective against bacteria, viruses, moles, and fungus,
[02:23:29.278 --> 02:23:30.459]  We're good to go.
[02:24:18.601 --> 02:24:22.122]  This is from The Groove Tube, a movie that Richard Belzer starred in.
[02:24:22.142 --> 02:24:24.123]  I bet you recognize that music, Richard.
[02:24:25.703 --> 02:24:27.504]  It was actually, that was my first film.
[02:24:28.104 --> 02:24:29.705]  That's a very hippie-er program right there.
[02:24:30.045 --> 02:24:33.166]  Again, you've got the new book out.
[02:24:33.246 --> 02:24:35.106]  I want to get into a bunch of world issues with you.
[02:24:35.166 --> 02:24:36.967]  Attack on Iran may trigger World War III.
[02:24:37.427 --> 02:24:44.149]  Iranian envoy is saying that's up at Infowars.com directly from Press TV, the official Iranian news agency.
[02:24:44.169 --> 02:24:45.950]  The word I'm getting from high-level sources
[02:24:46.650 --> 02:24:52.655]  Is that now North Korea is the diversion for a strike on Iran, so things are heating up quickly.
[02:24:52.875 --> 02:24:59.161]  Let's get into the book, though, because you profile a bunch of the people that were murdered to cover up what they knew about JFK.
[02:24:59.201 --> 02:25:01.203]  Let's talk about Hit List, your new book.
[02:25:01.603 --> 02:25:02.123]  Sure.
[02:25:02.223 --> 02:25:03.545]  We got it down to 50.
[02:25:03.865 --> 02:25:05.746]  There are some researchers that go as high as 300.
[02:25:06.827 --> 02:25:10.871]  But, you know, you have to account some people are just going to die that were involved in the murder.
[02:25:11.191 --> 02:25:12.632]  So we try to narrow it down.
[02:25:13.753 --> 02:25:22.779]  And, as you know, I'm glad you like the style of our book because we tell you what the official verdict is, then we tell you the actual circumstances, then the inconsistencies.
[02:25:23.219 --> 02:25:24.320]  It's heavily footnoted.
[02:25:24.340 --> 02:25:27.042]  You show photos, documents, admissions.
[02:25:27.062 --> 02:25:29.083]  You're not just saying this is your opinion.
[02:25:29.323 --> 02:25:30.404]  It's almost like a court case.
[02:25:30.944 --> 02:25:34.306]  Yeah, this is in the history section, which I'm very proud of, as was my last book.
[02:25:35.027 --> 02:25:39.670]  It's not, you know, fiction or, you know, life could be taken lightly.
[02:25:40.631 --> 02:25:41.811]  The list has on it
[02:25:43.573 --> 02:25:52.825]  Officer Tippett, Oswald, Ruby, Zangretti, there's even one on here who was thought to be involved but wasn't, so we straighten that out.
[02:25:52.866 --> 02:25:55.389]  That was Karen Kapsina.
[02:25:58.973 --> 02:26:05.215]  If there's any particular one you want, some of them were, you know, people that predicted, you know, don't believe it if you hear I commit suicide.
[02:26:05.616 --> 02:26:11.318]  People, you know, had their right side of their head shot, you know, and the guns in their hand, they're left-handed.
[02:26:11.798 --> 02:26:15.519]  People die of karate chops, one-car accidents, electrocution.
[02:26:15.539 --> 02:26:21.861]  Yeah, no, it's like Gary Webb saying, they're breaking in my house, they're threatening to kill me, my new book's coming out, I'll never commit suicide.
[02:26:21.881 --> 02:26:26.023]  He shoots himself twice in the head, and the police instantly say it's suicide.
[02:26:27.515 --> 02:26:36.618]  I know, Gary Webb and Danny Casolaro, people that get really close, you know, it's frightening.
[02:26:36.658 --> 02:26:42.060]  But you know what's interesting is, because of the internet, 1984 goes both ways now.
[02:26:42.200 --> 02:26:43.941]  So they may be watching us.
[02:26:44.901 --> 02:26:46.842]  We're certainly, you know, watching them, too.
[02:26:46.902 --> 02:26:50.303]  You also cover what they did to Oswald, and that he was CIA.
[02:26:50.323 --> 02:26:55.525]  I mean, right there, they executed him on TV to cover it up.
[02:26:55.605 --> 02:26:56.185]  I mean, boom.
[02:26:56.625 --> 02:26:57.646]  That's mind control.
[02:26:58.346 --> 02:27:08.749]  You know, when you can explode the President's head in broad daylight, and then shoot the guy who supposedly shot him on live television, that affects the collective unconscious of the entire nation.
[02:27:09.050 --> 02:27:09.990]  That was a message.
[02:27:10.610 --> 02:27:11.891]  And boy, did they send it.
[02:27:11.951 --> 02:27:12.811]  They got away with it.
[02:27:13.171 --> 02:27:20.294]  Yeah, Oswald, you know it's interesting when Nixon, the reason Nixon was ousted was not what we've been told.
[02:27:20.615 --> 02:27:29.439]  Nixon threatened the CIA that he was going to have the FBI investigate the CIA about the Bay of Pigs thing, which Haldeman said is code for the Kennedy assassination.
[02:27:30.199 --> 02:27:30.980]  Because Hoover
[02:27:31.940 --> 02:27:33.961]  You know, Oswald was working for Hoover.
[02:27:34.161 --> 02:27:35.842]  Yeah, that's even come out on the tapes.
[02:27:35.882 --> 02:27:38.944]  He wanted to actually, he was a bad guy, but Nixon actually wanted to be president.
[02:27:39.244 --> 02:27:41.605]  And it's like, you know, the Bay of Pigs boys.
[02:27:42.165 --> 02:27:43.146]  You don't want to go there.
[02:27:43.186 --> 02:27:44.086]  That's Jack Kennedy.
[02:27:44.527 --> 02:27:46.708]  Threatening him with that and the establishment.
[02:27:46.748 --> 02:27:47.288]  Really, buddy?
[02:27:47.708 --> 02:27:47.969]  Really?
[02:27:48.809 --> 02:27:51.150]  Well, JFK threatened him and they exploded his head.
[02:27:51.170 --> 02:27:52.331]  So Nixon should have known better.
[02:27:54.542 --> 02:28:03.627]  They learned that the CIA had broken their charter and were getting into things like the Bay of Pigs and Vietnam, which weren't covert operations.
[02:28:04.107 --> 02:28:06.789]  We ran 2.6 million troops through Vietnam.
[02:28:06.829 --> 02:28:07.769]  That's not covert.
[02:28:08.329 --> 02:28:15.073]  So Kennedy knew that the generals and the CIA were just, you know, really out to get him.
[02:28:15.253 --> 02:28:15.593]  That's right.
[02:28:15.653 --> 02:28:21.919]  Prior to the staged Gulf of Tonkin in 64, millions of people were rotated in as advisors.
[02:28:22.439 --> 02:28:24.280]  And how many tens of thousands died?
[02:28:24.300 --> 02:28:27.203]  But they're not counted to the official war tally.
[02:28:27.903 --> 02:28:28.404]  That's right.
[02:28:28.964 --> 02:28:30.746]  They say 56,000 or something.
[02:28:31.086 --> 02:28:38.272]  But there were more than that because you don't count the years that we were going in and sabotaging and doing all that stuff.
[02:28:38.572 --> 02:28:39.993]  Plus the million plus
[02:28:40.814 --> 02:28:45.099]  Some people say 3 million women and children, Vietnamese non-combatants.
[02:28:45.800 --> 02:28:47.061]  Now this is dark stuff.
[02:28:47.081 --> 02:28:49.363]  That war was clearly a money-making war.
[02:28:50.004 --> 02:28:54.469]  When Kennedy was saying he wanted peace and détente, these guys just said, uh-oh.
[02:28:55.150 --> 02:28:58.513]  Oh yeah, they'd still have Vietnam War going if we stood for it, literally.
[02:28:58.533 --> 02:29:00.255]  Oh yeah, they made so much money there.
[02:29:01.056 --> 02:29:02.777]  And, you know, that was Eisenhower and Nixon.
[02:29:02.937 --> 02:29:03.457]  No one knew.
[02:29:03.477 --> 02:29:04.777]  It's like Truman.
[02:29:05.197 --> 02:29:07.958]  You know, everyone thought Dewey was going to win and then Truman comes in.
[02:29:08.439 --> 02:29:09.639]  Truman didn't want the CIA.
[02:29:09.839 --> 02:29:13.880]  I hate Truman, by the way, because he dropped bombs unnecessarily on Japan.
[02:29:14.241 --> 02:29:16.341]  But he did do a couple of things that were pretty lucid.
[02:29:16.741 --> 02:29:19.222]  He didn't he didn't know that there were two CIAs.
[02:29:19.702 --> 02:29:27.465]  Those brothers are running something out of the State Department and the regular CIA was trying to, you know, really catch or, you know, do their job.
[02:29:27.525 --> 02:29:29.826]  And when Truman found out about it, he just
[02:29:31.026 --> 02:29:31.886]  His hands were tied.
[02:29:32.307 --> 02:29:32.907]  Absolutely.
[02:29:32.927 --> 02:29:33.627]  In fact, that's true.
[02:29:33.647 --> 02:29:37.248]  That's why I've always said the real CIA is in the State Department.
[02:29:37.769 --> 02:29:41.270]  And then Pecheneg's like, no, Alex, no, no, it's not actually him now.
[02:29:41.730 --> 02:29:43.471]  We'll be right back with Richard Belzer.
[02:29:43.751 --> 02:29:44.211]  Stay with us.

[02:32:00.049 --> 02:32:01.049]  I had tried everything.
[02:32:01.109 --> 02:32:06.171]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating, I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[02:32:06.611 --> 02:32:11.072]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[02:32:11.432 --> 02:32:17.794]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[02:32:18.274 --> 02:32:28.766]  Now there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[02:32:29.507 --> 02:32:33.652]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Holland Burst, and Rebound.
[02:32:33.972 --> 02:32:36.996]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day,
[02:32:37.236 --> 02:32:38.477]  That's a need for a new world, right?
[02:33:05.515 --> 02:33:11.663]  But it has different characteristics in different parts of the world.
[02:33:13.045 --> 02:33:19.293]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:25.435 --> 02:33:27.656]  All right, we'll take some of your phone calls here with Richard Belzer.
[02:33:27.676 --> 02:33:29.137]  I want to get a little bit more into the book.
[02:33:29.778 --> 02:33:31.279]  Everybody really should read it.
[02:33:31.659 --> 02:33:37.343]  It's available at InfoWareStore.com or you can call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:33:37.963 --> 02:33:40.285]  And you may think you know a lot about JFK.
[02:33:40.425 --> 02:33:44.788]  This really shows you all the people they set up, they killed, they demonized.
[02:33:46.169 --> 02:33:47.950]  It's a very, very important book.
[02:33:48.010 --> 02:33:48.550]  Hit list.
[02:33:49.571 --> 02:33:53.073]  The new book just coming out by Richard Belzer with David Wayne.
[02:33:53.854 --> 02:33:55.115]  Now expanding
[02:33:56.576 --> 02:34:13.263]  On all this, the head of the Italian Supreme Court, their Chief Justice, their CIA head has also come out and said that the West, that NATO has a terror group that stages terror attacks and that they've used right-wing, communist terror, Muslim terror as a pretext to take everybody's rights.
[02:34:13.784 --> 02:34:17.445]  And that, quote, the Bilderberg group is calling the shots and that he has proof.
[02:34:17.886 --> 02:34:20.367]  This is in the biggest Italian newspapers now.
[02:34:21.487 --> 02:34:26.312]  So my point is, is that no wonder the media is not supposed to report on Bilderberg over these years.
[02:34:26.632 --> 02:34:28.193]  That shows how important it is.
[02:34:28.654 --> 02:34:33.218]  Now that it's been forced out, Glenn Beck's like, Alex Jones shouldn't talk about Bilderberg.
[02:34:33.258 --> 02:34:34.018]  That's kooky.
[02:34:34.298 --> 02:34:35.339]  They don't run anything.
[02:34:37.884 --> 02:34:40.565]  Well, yeah, I mean, I'm not even here to bash Glenn Beck.
[02:34:40.605 --> 02:34:41.566]  He does some good work.
[02:34:41.946 --> 02:34:43.007]  I want to unify everybody.
[02:34:43.047 --> 02:34:46.569]  My point is, he won't even talk about him and makes fun of people.
[02:34:46.829 --> 02:34:48.510]  That's because they're at the top of the pyramid.
[02:34:48.530 --> 02:34:52.352]  But, Richard, continuing, let's get into some of the most important... Can I just say one quick thing, Alex?
[02:34:52.692 --> 02:34:54.593]  The Muslim Brotherhood are Nazis.
[02:34:54.893 --> 02:34:56.153]  They're not neo-Nazis.
[02:34:56.534 --> 02:35:01.036]  Alan Dahl has convinced the Saudis to take them in after World War II.
[02:35:01.076 --> 02:35:01.416]  Sure.
[02:35:01.576 --> 02:35:03.197]  Because the Arabs were pro-Nazi.
[02:35:03.257 --> 02:35:04.638]  And the Grand Imam and all of it.
[02:35:05.138 --> 02:35:07.999]  And they all went to Saudi Arabia, and guess what they did?
[02:35:08.059 --> 02:35:10.080]  They started the madrasas.
[02:35:11.100 --> 02:35:27.185]  No, no, no, our government, you're absolutely right, I love it when somebody knows history, this is all, there was a scandal 15 years ago, the Washington Post reported, we were still paying hundreds of millions a year, all over the Muslim world, to pay for school books that said kill America.
[02:35:27.966 --> 02:35:28.646]  To this day!
[02:35:29.861 --> 02:35:31.683]  But, you know, they're real Nazis.
[02:35:31.743 --> 02:35:33.024]  It's not like Neo-Nazis.
[02:35:33.064 --> 02:35:34.965]  They're second-generation Nazis.
[02:35:35.406 --> 02:35:35.866]  Well, no, no.
[02:35:35.946 --> 02:35:37.868]  I mean, it's Raiders of the Lost Ark.
[02:35:38.188 --> 02:35:40.971]  They create the next group of opposition.
[02:35:41.271 --> 02:35:44.534]  That's why they're putting the Muslim Brotherhood in everywhere, and that's Obama.
[02:35:45.635 --> 02:35:47.917]  Well, it's just a formula that they always use.
[02:35:47.997 --> 02:35:50.259]  Obama's just... Presidents are part-time workers.
[02:35:50.319 --> 02:35:50.779]  Exactly.
[02:35:51.840 --> 02:35:52.541]  That's why it takes off.
[02:35:52.581 --> 02:35:53.922]  It's like four months out of the year now.
[02:35:54.362 --> 02:35:57.305]  Now, stopping right there, Richard, let's get into some more of the cases in the book.
[02:35:58.513 --> 02:36:02.154]  I think, you know, number one in the book is Tippett, who's very mysterious.
[02:36:02.654 --> 02:36:07.875]  You know, we found out that he worked for an intelligence unit in Dallas.
[02:36:08.315 --> 02:36:10.276]  He wasn't supposed to be where he was.
[02:36:10.736 --> 02:36:11.656]  It's very fishy.
[02:36:11.876 --> 02:36:14.596]  Oswald did not shoot Tippett.
[02:36:14.757 --> 02:36:18.417]  You know, the officer on the scene marked the shells at the scene.
[02:36:18.977 --> 02:36:20.798]  And, you know, then when he went to see the
[02:36:22.018 --> 02:36:24.300]  Exhibits, there are different shells there.
[02:36:24.380 --> 02:36:26.381]  So, you know, it was a different gun.
[02:36:27.061 --> 02:36:30.623]  And Tippett was seen having breakfast with Oswald.
[02:36:31.584 --> 02:36:33.105]  He's a very fishy character.
[02:36:33.125 --> 02:36:39.228]  And we trace all his movements, which are very suspicious.
[02:36:39.268 --> 02:36:41.430]  He had no business being where he was.
[02:36:41.870 --> 02:36:47.573]  He was also seen with Ruby and Oswald.
[02:36:48.174 --> 02:36:50.195]  And a lot of people don't know that a lot of
[02:36:50.636 --> 02:36:53.627]  Local police departments are infiltrated by military intelligence.
[02:36:53.727 --> 02:36:54.590]  Oh, massively!
[02:36:56.238 --> 02:37:02.161]  And so, and number two is Oswald, who, you know, had an FBI number.
[02:37:02.221 --> 02:37:04.462]  He was getting $200 a month from the FBI.
[02:37:04.922 --> 02:37:15.867]  Hoover was so interested in Oswald that in 1959, he wrote a memo saying, someone's using Lee Harvey Oswald's ID while he's, you know, overseas trying to buy trucks for Cubans.
[02:37:15.887 --> 02:37:17.848]  You know, like, it's just been there.
[02:37:18.369 --> 02:37:20.770]  Ruby Testa was a witness for Nixon in 1946.
[02:37:21.570 --> 02:37:24.693]  Well, you know, a lot of people say he was low-level, but I think that's a cover.
[02:37:24.713 --> 02:37:29.778]  If you look at what he really did, it's almost like he was an operational commander.
[02:37:29.798 --> 02:37:34.322]  And then, of course, that's who they burned to get Red to burn the whole thing down.
[02:37:34.362 --> 02:37:35.323]  They do that a lot.
[02:37:35.343 --> 02:37:36.904]  Yeah, that's a good point.
[02:37:36.984 --> 02:37:44.411]  They paint a picture of Oswald as a lone nod and kind of inarticulate, but they're at least two Oswalds.
[02:37:44.451 --> 02:37:45.292]  That goes without saying.
[02:37:45.852 --> 02:37:49.533]  And Oswald was recruited as a child, uh, or as a teenager.
[02:37:49.553 --> 02:37:51.374]  I mean, this guy was... Well, there's some theories about that.
[02:37:51.414 --> 02:37:53.155]  Well, yeah, he was a fake defector.
[02:37:53.995 --> 02:38:00.737]  Uh, when he was a young, you know, they sent, like, 18 or 19 Marines and Army over to Russia to pretend they were defecting.
[02:38:01.117 --> 02:38:03.778]  Russia knew about each and every one of them virtually.
[02:38:03.838 --> 02:38:09.000]  Sure, but his recruitment, even into the military, if you go back and look at it, had all these connections as well.
[02:38:09.040 --> 02:38:11.961]  I mean, they, they, he was... I'm not surprised, but, uh,
[02:38:12.681 --> 02:38:16.603]  Hoover, that's why Nixon went to Hoover, because he could blackmail the CIA.
[02:38:16.883 --> 02:38:24.185]  But the CIA was also using Oswald, so it got really, really sticky and messy for both agencies.
[02:38:24.786 --> 02:38:30.388]  And Oswald was supposed to be taken out in the movie theater, and he wasn't.
[02:38:30.408 --> 02:38:33.909]  You know, so they had to get rid of, well, you know, that story.
[02:38:34.809 --> 02:38:39.191]  Well, McVeigh got mad about them wanting him to blow up the Oklahoma City building, and he said, no kids.
[02:38:39.852 --> 02:38:41.533]  No women, no kids, like Tony Montana.
[02:38:41.553 --> 02:38:45.415]  He was special forces, and it's the same deal, so they set him up.
[02:38:47.596 --> 02:38:49.557]  And Ruby is just the dirtiest.
[02:38:50.197 --> 02:38:54.703]  He was an informant in 1947 for Nixon for a crime commission.
[02:38:55.264 --> 02:38:57.406]  He ran drugs and guns through Cuba.
[02:38:58.748 --> 02:39:00.851]  You know, he put in a ton of money just before he went.
[02:39:01.471 --> 02:39:04.035]  Not a ton, but you know, like 17 or 18 grand or something.
[02:39:04.415 --> 02:39:06.518]  You know, the timing of it was impeccable.
[02:39:07.098 --> 02:39:09.360]  He knew he was going to be murdered, you know.
[02:39:09.900 --> 02:39:12.322]  And then they gave him this fast-acting cancer.
[02:39:12.622 --> 02:39:16.885]  The CIA, as you know, Alex, can kill us in so many ways.
[02:39:16.965 --> 02:39:20.547]  So that's why you have to be really, really careful.
[02:39:20.567 --> 02:39:26.031]  I mean, they could walk by you and just spray some aerosol and it's over.
[02:39:26.411 --> 02:39:38.022]  So, you know, they have, they have an ice, they have a gun that shoots bullets that are made out of ice that look like a period so small that goes in and kills you and, you know, melts.
[02:39:38.583 --> 02:39:43.207]  And, you know, unless you're a genius forensics guy, you don't see that tiny, tiny hole.
[02:39:44.187 --> 02:40:02.719]  Anyway, you know, so Tippett... Speaking of Tippett, to use a pun, the tip-off they've killed somebody is when they immediately say no foul play, immediately say it's suicider, Breitbart's not even cold, and they're saying, oh no, heart attack, you know, 45 minutes after he's put into the hospital.
[02:40:03.480 --> 02:40:08.183]  I mean, that's when you really know is when they immediately come out with the official story.
[02:40:08.223 --> 02:40:08.483]  Go ahead.
[02:40:08.643 --> 02:40:09.864]  Yeah, exactly right.
[02:40:09.904 --> 02:40:11.484]  That's really fishy.
[02:40:13.185 --> 02:40:18.948]  They got Oswald, what, 70 minutes later and had descriptions of him in New Zealand.
[02:40:18.968 --> 02:40:21.509]  He wasn't on the watch list.
[02:40:21.810 --> 02:40:24.091]  He was, but they didn't tell Dallas police.
[02:40:24.611 --> 02:40:28.574]  You know, it's very interesting because people don't understand.
[02:40:28.594 --> 02:40:32.336]  There are elements within the Dallas police that had no knowledge of anything.
[02:40:32.356 --> 02:40:33.517]  There are elements that did.
[02:40:33.937 --> 02:40:35.418]  Elements within the CIA.
[02:40:35.498 --> 02:40:50.468]  And, you know, like Grant Stockwell, you know, a big former ambassador to Ireland, fell or was pushed from his office window on the 13th floor of the DuPont building in Midtown Miami.
[02:40:50.929 --> 02:40:52.029]  And I called it suicide.
[02:40:52.430 --> 02:40:53.871]  But, you know, it's like
[02:40:56.031 --> 02:41:14.215]  Two reporters, this is a good point, and I don't mean that in a light way, but Jim Coath and Bill Hunter were two reporters who were in a room where it was openly discussed prior to the murder of Kennedy about killing Kennedy at this Cuban woman's house.
[02:41:14.635 --> 02:41:15.595]  They happened to be there.
[02:41:16.116 --> 02:41:16.456]  Okay.
[02:41:17.056 --> 02:41:22.357]  Coath, victim, surprised a burglar and burglar killed him.
[02:41:23.655 --> 02:41:26.757]  Hunter, accidental shooting by a police officer.
[02:41:53.835 --> 02:41:56.657]  No, she got in a room with him alone.
[02:41:57.177 --> 02:42:04.322]  She told her agent, her best friend, and two other people, she has all this explosive information, she's gonna blow the lid off the Kennedy case.
[02:42:05.083 --> 02:42:16.711]  And word got out, so Hoover started demonizing her, and she said, the FBI would have their time better spent investigating who killed our president than harassing me.
[02:42:18.692 --> 02:42:21.174]  So anyway, that's the demonization I was talking about.
[02:42:21.214 --> 02:42:21.614]  Keep going.
[02:42:21.654 --> 02:42:22.234]  Exactly.
[02:42:22.735 --> 02:42:32.941]  And she dies in bed with all her makeup on, you know, her eyelashes, and a book on her that she already read.
[02:42:32.961 --> 02:42:35.123]  Her reading glasses were nowhere in sight.
[02:42:35.463 --> 02:42:38.125]  They said she, you know, OD'd on barbiturates.
[02:42:38.525 --> 02:42:40.566]  There were three different kinds of barbiturates in her.
[02:42:40.946 --> 02:42:42.948]  She didn't, you know, but they said she, you know,
[02:42:43.788 --> 02:42:47.770]  She committed suicide or accidentally ingested barbiturates.
[02:42:48.051 --> 02:42:48.971]  They murdered her.
[02:42:49.331 --> 02:42:54.814]  Her best friend, who she gave, you know, who knew all about it, she died like a day or two later.
[02:42:54.834 --> 02:42:58.656]  You know, it's like David Ferry and that doctor he was working with.
[02:42:58.896 --> 02:43:04.880]  They were whacked within 48 hours because Ferry was... And by the way, everybody that serves the New World Order should understand this.
[02:43:05.720 --> 02:43:09.204]  They always end up getting rid of the people that do the dirty work.
[02:43:09.244 --> 02:43:09.965]  You're fools.
[02:43:10.585 --> 02:43:11.606]  You're absolutely right.
[02:43:12.207 --> 02:43:18.394]  Virtually everyone, populists obviously included, is expendable to these people.
[02:43:18.614 --> 02:43:21.857]  Except E. Howard Heintz, and they probably wish they had killed him now.
[02:43:22.498 --> 02:43:24.159]  Well, you know, it's the irony of that.
[02:43:24.179 --> 02:43:25.060]  I'm sure you've had St.
[02:43:25.100 --> 02:43:25.840]  John on, right?
[02:43:25.880 --> 02:43:26.161]  Yes.
[02:43:26.281 --> 02:43:29.703]  The son who he confessed to, and then he rallied and didn't die.
[02:43:29.723 --> 02:43:35.687]  He literally made a deathbed confession, and then he somehow lived a little longer, and then he had to recant.
[02:43:36.407 --> 02:43:37.948]  That guy was tough.
[02:43:38.149 --> 02:43:44.433]  His whole story, most of it's classified, but what we know, really, really wild guy.
[02:43:44.473 --> 02:43:46.774]  I mean, a sniper in World War II, the whole nine yards.
[02:43:47.275 --> 02:43:49.176]  Psyops guy, really dark.
[02:43:49.596 --> 02:43:51.898]  You know, he had his ears operated on.
[02:43:53.297 --> 02:43:55.278]  Uh, because, you know, ears aren't identifying it.
[02:43:55.378 --> 02:43:57.219]  After, yeah, he got picked up at the railway station.
[02:43:57.239 --> 02:43:58.000]  Tell folks about that.
[02:43:58.380 --> 02:44:09.466]  Yeah, well, you know, there's a guy who looks remarkable, the so-called Tramps, who had, who were, for Tramps, had new shoes on, and were clean-shaven, and were strolling cows.
[02:44:09.586 --> 02:44:09.687]  St.
[02:44:09.727 --> 02:44:10.107]  John, St.
[02:44:10.447 --> 02:44:22.534]  John Hunt remembers seeing that when he was a kid, hanging up in a phone booth when it came out, and thinking, seeing, oh, dad, he didn't even read that it was like, here's the Tramps, it was a JFK seminar or something.
[02:44:22.794 --> 02:44:23.255]  That's right.
[02:44:39.594 --> 02:44:45.656]  The jury believed that Hunt was involved in a conspiracy by the government to assassinate the president.
[02:44:45.916 --> 02:44:47.136]  That's a jury trial.
[02:44:48.117 --> 02:44:56.619]  But he had his ears operated on by the time of the trial so that he could maybe disguise his appearance.
[02:44:57.460 --> 02:44:59.180]  That was pretty lame, actually.
[02:45:00.561 --> 02:45:04.002]  And again, this is important because they just go, aha, the crazy people!
[02:45:05.342 --> 02:45:08.303]  Let's think, Kennedy, you know, was killed by more than one shooter.
[02:45:08.684 --> 02:45:08.804]  Aha!
[02:45:08.824 --> 02:45:12.345]  How many years have you been saying there's a new world order?
[02:45:12.365 --> 02:45:13.686]  Like 17 years?
[02:45:13.786 --> 02:45:16.227]  You know, now people thought you were crazy.
[02:45:16.487 --> 02:45:19.268]  And I've been railing about Kennedy since, you know, the 70s.
[02:45:19.729 --> 02:45:20.989]  And people rolled their eyes at me.
[02:45:21.029 --> 02:45:26.992]  But now... Now 90% of the average Pole, as you source in your book, know that it was a conspiracy.
[02:45:27.032 --> 02:45:29.153]  So this is a victory for the truth.
[02:45:30.174 --> 02:45:36.604]  What do you think of Tom Hanks and all these people trying to resuscitate Humpty Dumpty?
[02:45:37.005 --> 02:45:38.347]  I'm going to tell you a story about this.
[02:45:38.587 --> 02:45:43.616]  I was at my friend Martin Short's house a couple of years ago, not to drop names.
[02:45:44.955 --> 02:45:49.136]  Every year he has a Christmas party, and every major celebrity is there.
[02:45:49.156 --> 02:45:56.558]  You know, it's a fun thing, and then Paul Schaeffer or someone will go over to the piano and will sing, and it's private, it's really cool.
[02:45:56.598 --> 02:45:57.559]  And Tom was there.
[02:45:57.579 --> 02:46:00.519]  This is about, I think, two or three New Year's ago.
[02:46:01.180 --> 02:46:05.141]  And I knew that he was going to... I read he's doing a ten-part series for HBO.
[02:46:06.141 --> 02:46:08.022]  About the Kennedy assassination.
[02:46:08.342 --> 02:46:11.762]  And then I read, he said, oh, the conspiracy theorists are going to be upset with me.
[02:46:12.083 --> 02:46:18.524]  So I went over to him at this party, and I don't usually do this, Alex, but I, I know Tom and I like Tom.
[02:46:19.124 --> 02:46:24.866]  I said, Tom, as a friend, I'm telling you, do not do this documentary.
[02:46:25.802 --> 02:46:28.084]  He said, well, I'm basing it on Vincent Bugliosi's book.
[02:46:28.704 --> 02:46:35.208]  I said, Tom, that was a prosecutor who did a steroid version of the Warren Commission.
[02:46:35.568 --> 02:46:36.949]  It's all false scholarship.
[02:46:37.430 --> 02:46:39.331]  And the narrative is going to be an embarrassment.
[02:46:39.651 --> 02:46:40.392]  And that money would be
[02:46:41.492 --> 02:46:47.355]  Much more well spent on other things, you know, like the vets or kids or, you know what I mean?
[02:46:47.375 --> 02:46:49.736]  Like millions of dollars to do 10 hours.
[02:46:49.916 --> 02:46:50.637]  Oswald did it.
[02:46:51.037 --> 02:46:54.258]  I just felt, you know, I'm paraphrasing, but that's essentially what I said to him.
[02:46:54.679 --> 02:46:59.381]  And then I explained to him why it was physically impossible for Oswald to even have fired a shot.
[02:46:59.901 --> 02:47:01.282]  You know, he's having lunch on the first floor.
[02:47:01.302 --> 02:47:02.303]  He went to the second floor.
[02:47:02.624 --> 02:47:11.552]  I mean, I don't want to get into the minutiae, but I really wanted Tom not to do this, not to embarrass himself, not to misinform the public because he's a beloved guy.
[02:47:12.192 --> 02:47:13.634]  So time passes.
[02:47:14.014 --> 02:47:17.397]  I bump into him at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame dinner backstage.
[02:47:17.437 --> 02:47:18.939]  He's got two security guys with him.
[02:47:19.679 --> 02:47:21.901]  And I just went over to say hello.
[02:47:22.822 --> 02:47:34.870]  And he sees me, and this is the first time since the New Year's Eve party, and he comes over and we embrace, and he goes, hey Bells, don't worry, I'm on the case, and he scurries off, which he has never done to me.
[02:47:34.910 --> 02:47:41.915]  We always talk and joke and, you know, and just so, because he thought I was going to ask him what's happening with the Kennedy thing.
[02:47:42.455 --> 02:47:45.596]  So I mean, I love Tom, but he's now he's doing a movie.
[02:47:46.136 --> 02:47:47.597]  He's learned part of his lesson.
[02:47:47.617 --> 02:47:49.357]  He's not doing a 10-hour documentary anymore.
[02:47:49.697 --> 02:47:55.039]  He's doing a feature film about that day in Dallas and how it affected people.
[02:47:55.079 --> 02:47:59.920]  But it's gonna, you know, it's gonna reinforce this myth that
[02:48:02.021 --> 02:48:06.803]  But the myth is showing, I mean, if half the public thought the government killed Kennedy, it might work.
[02:48:07.423 --> 02:48:09.583]  He's really going to hurt himself with this.
[02:48:10.124 --> 02:48:10.804]  Absolutely.
[02:48:11.064 --> 02:48:14.425]  Especially now, because Alex, it's the 50th anniversary.
[02:48:14.765 --> 02:48:20.307]  There's dozens and dozens of books, and I so appreciate you talking about my book, because we really try to...
[02:48:21.928 --> 02:48:23.789]  No, I agree with your strategy.
[02:48:23.829 --> 02:48:27.171]  I mean, the killing of all these people is just ridiculous.
[02:48:27.231 --> 02:48:28.211]  I mean, they're covering it up.
[02:48:28.492 --> 02:48:30.113]  That's the evidence of the crime right there.
[02:48:30.393 --> 02:48:37.777]  It's like if a cop pulls up and sees you look at them paranoidly running your house, that becomes almost probable cause.
[02:48:38.038 --> 02:48:44.622]  Well, when you've got piles of dead bodies and evidence of like someone shoving something in their pants, I mean, this is very suspicious.
[02:48:45.262 --> 02:48:47.782]  Yeah, it's terrifying, but you know what?
[02:48:48.443 --> 02:48:50.403]  A reasonable suspicion is the word, go ahead.
[02:48:50.703 --> 02:49:01.045]  Yeah, but you know, Thomas Jefferson and Adams, they were talking about if the electorate, if the people are not informed, then the country doesn't have any reason to exist.
[02:49:01.065 --> 02:49:12.467]  They said the great object is that the whole of the electorate be informed and educated about the way the world works, to paraphrase it, and then tyranny will vanish like phantoms at dawn.
[02:49:13.996 --> 02:49:14.776]  Exactly right.
[02:49:15.336 --> 02:49:22.218]  And you know, it's amazing that over 200 years ago, these guys predicted what could happen.
[02:49:22.878 --> 02:49:27.280]  Because you know, they designed it where the country's a pyramid, but it's inverted.
[02:49:27.300 --> 02:49:34.042]  In other words, the people are at the top and the elected officials are at the bottom because the people are supposed to now they flipped it.
[02:49:34.082 --> 02:49:38.863]  So the elite now that the you know, and it gets fewer and fewer, which is
[02:49:39.463 --> 02:49:47.646]  Really, I think we're making... Oh, you've seen how they're killing all these oligarchs and taking the money of the billionaires and... I mean, they are just looting the hell out of each other.
[02:49:47.866 --> 02:49:50.848]  And then it turns out the billionaires that robbed them aren't exempt.
[02:49:51.248 --> 02:49:53.069]  I mean, it's just good old-fashioned mafia.
[02:49:53.389 --> 02:49:57.210]  And when good people give in to corruption, it just invites more.
[02:49:57.751 --> 02:49:58.311]  I don't know...
[02:49:59.071 --> 02:49:59.552]  That's right.
[02:49:59.712 --> 02:50:11.941]  A lot of good people, though, are seduced into something thinking they're doing something, you know, for national security or, you know, but they're really fronting... Oh no, when I've been approached, you know, off record about big media jobs, they're like, Alex, globalism is real.
[02:50:11.961 --> 02:50:13.102]  We're lifting up the third world.
[02:50:13.162 --> 02:50:14.423]  And yeah, there is a new world order.
[02:50:14.663 --> 02:50:15.724]  We've got to lead the world.
[02:50:15.764 --> 02:50:17.726]  And Alex, the Federal Reserve cares.
[02:50:17.786 --> 02:50:21.108]  And how would you like to make 15 million, 20 million a year?
[02:50:21.148 --> 02:50:21.529]  How's that sound?
[02:50:21.929 --> 02:50:26.593]  You know, I mean, but that's how they come at you, is we're gonna, you're gonna be a good guy!
[02:50:27.013 --> 02:50:29.415]  But I'm sorry, I've looked at this tree's fruits, Richard.
[02:50:29.775 --> 02:50:31.316]  It is not putting out good fruit.
[02:50:31.857 --> 02:50:34.519]  You know, you and I both were inspired by this book.
[02:50:34.919 --> 02:50:36.040]  Not Dare Call a Conspiracy.
[02:50:36.320 --> 02:50:37.221]  Yeah, I read that.
[02:50:37.481 --> 02:50:38.622]  Look at how, look at my copy.
[02:50:38.822 --> 02:50:39.803]  It cost a dollar.
[02:50:39.943 --> 02:50:40.884]  That's how old I am.
[02:50:42.225 --> 02:50:46.170]  No, that really blew my... Hey, bro, let's take a couple segments of calls straight ahead.
[02:50:46.190 --> 02:50:50.855]  They're all over the map, but I promise I'm gonna get to Brendan and Richard and Nick and David.

[02:52:11.783 --> 02:52:18.725]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats, but we can't do that without your help.
[02:52:19.005 --> 02:52:29.548]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at InfoWars.com, you will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[02:52:29.568 --> 02:52:29.848]  I'm good.
[02:52:59.551 --> 02:53:03.675]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[02:53:04.336 --> 02:53:06.478]  I want you to know some very important information.
[02:53:07.379 --> 02:53:15.707]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[02:53:16.348 --> 02:53:21.253]  Now, 27 years later, carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[02:53:21.878 --> 02:53:32.849]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.
[02:53:33.250 --> 02:53:40.257]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[02:53:40.937 --> 02:53:45.201]  Call 1-866-VENUSFLY or order from carnivora.com.
[02:53:45.221 --> 02:53:48.403]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.
[02:53:48.824 --> 02:53:55.790]  That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VENUSFLY or visit carnivora.com.
[02:53:56.090 --> 02:53:57.091]  Protect your immune system.
[02:53:57.371 --> 02:53:58.392]  It's the only one you've got.
[02:54:08.527 --> 02:54:09.788]  Alright, these will be all over the map.
[02:54:09.808 --> 02:54:12.929]  Some of them have been holding patiently since before Belzer joined us.
[02:54:13.789 --> 02:54:15.890]  Uh, you know folks, I don't push something unless I believe in it.
[02:54:16.591 --> 02:54:19.472]  And I think you should get the book at Infowarsstore.com, hit list.
[02:54:20.372 --> 02:54:23.094]  Uh, this is, because you think I'm sick of JFK, I'm not.
[02:54:23.134 --> 02:54:25.395]  A book like this, I went through this in two nights.
[02:54:26.555 --> 02:54:28.377]  Reading and even learned some stuff I didn't know.
[02:54:28.437 --> 02:54:29.518]  Went and looked up some facts.
[02:54:30.719 --> 02:54:32.501]  It's very scholarly with David Wayne.
[02:54:32.842 --> 02:54:38.747]  Available at InfowarsStore.com when you buy books, videos, t-shirts, all that at the site you fund our operation.
[02:54:39.008 --> 02:54:40.389]  Don't forget Infowars Nightly News.
[02:54:40.409 --> 02:54:44.193]  You can get 11 memberships for $5.95 a month and give it to your friends and family.
[02:54:44.633 --> 02:54:45.614]  Big nightly news.
[02:54:46.635 --> 02:54:46.995]  You know what?
[02:54:47.035 --> 02:54:49.077]  I've got to go even into more overdrive.
[02:54:49.818 --> 02:54:56.825]  Because we've got a big ammo shortage rationing report a week in the making that David Knight finished.
[02:54:56.845 --> 02:54:57.165]  You know what?
[02:54:57.405 --> 02:55:00.228]  I'll premiere it on the Nightly News tonight and play it on the radio tomorrow.
[02:55:00.588 --> 02:55:01.329]  So I'll do that.
[02:55:01.369 --> 02:55:02.630]  That'll be tonight, 7 o'clock.
[02:55:03.591 --> 02:55:05.713]  Right now, let's talk to Brendan.
[02:55:05.733 --> 02:55:08.997]  I want to talk about guns, Mark Dyson, Bilderberg.
[02:55:09.037 --> 02:55:10.218]  Go ahead, Brendan, you're on the air.
[02:55:11.348 --> 02:55:12.088]  No, that's all right.
[02:55:12.128 --> 02:55:16.429]  That's what I was calling in about, but it's an honor to talk to Richard.
[02:55:16.529 --> 02:55:22.151]  I actually am holding in my hands a red... Yeah, I'm sorry.
[02:55:22.171 --> 02:55:25.132]  They forgot to turn him up to the guest or it's not turned up properly there.
[02:55:25.152 --> 02:55:29.133]  He said it's an honor to talk to you, Richard.
[02:55:29.173 --> 02:55:29.953]  Go ahead and call her.
[02:55:30.933 --> 02:55:42.801]  Yep, and actually I'm holding in my hands a red Freedom t-shirt from Infowars store that was signed by comedian Bill Burr, who was in my restaurant last week.
[02:55:43.541 --> 02:55:54.348]  And it just made me think that it's an honor to talk to Richard, and I wish more people would come out and talk about the things that they know in their hearts and are watching.
[02:55:54.408 --> 02:55:59.452]  So I talked to Bill Burr... By the way, there are subtle ways... Can I talk about it a little more, please?
[02:56:00.529 --> 02:56:00.830]  Sorry.
[02:56:01.691 --> 02:56:03.514]  No, it's alright.
[02:56:05.056 --> 02:56:09.404]  People a lot of times call in and they talk about small talk and stuff and that's great and I appreciate your support.
[02:56:09.664 --> 02:56:11.227]  Do you have a question for Richard Belzer?
[02:56:13.290 --> 02:56:15.511]  How do you think we can turn on more people?
[02:56:15.631 --> 02:56:17.391]  I mean, maybe not Christopher Walken.
[02:56:17.431 --> 02:56:28.454]  How do you think we can reach out to more celebrities who are willing to talk about being awake and the things that are actually happening and not the mainstream media?
[02:56:28.474 --> 02:56:29.754]  That's a great question, Brendan.
[02:56:29.794 --> 02:56:31.175]  Thank you so much and God bless you.
[02:56:31.775 --> 02:56:33.255]  They're from Wisconsin.
[02:56:33.295 --> 02:56:34.356]  Yeah, great question.
[02:56:34.396 --> 02:56:34.956]  Thanks, Brendan.
[02:56:36.076 --> 02:56:45.823]  Well, the problem is a lot of celebrities are terrified to take an extreme position unless it's like on the environment or something, and that's not a slam.
[02:56:46.663 --> 02:56:51.587]  But if we have extreme tyranny, there's got to be an extreme response, as Barry Goldwater said.
[02:56:54.164 --> 02:57:14.726]  Yes, and you know, I think that your show is growing actually daily, I would imagine, and weekly, and your brilliant idea of having people get access to information, then turn on 50 other people, and you know, it's like with my books, you know, people tell other people, it's like
[02:57:15.666 --> 02:57:17.547]  You know, it really is we the people.
[02:57:17.768 --> 02:57:28.634]  I mean, somehow the elites have kind of demonized the common man, which would make Jefferson puke.
[02:57:29.054 --> 02:57:33.096]  He admired the common man, the hard-working man.
[02:57:33.156 --> 02:57:35.898]  I'm not being patronizing on his... No, no, it's true!
[02:57:36.738 --> 02:57:39.019]  Fast warfare, it's, you know, who we are.
[02:57:39.039 --> 02:57:52.848]  This is an amazing, open-hearted, multi-ethnic country that was a great idea, and slowly but surely, you know, the international banking cartel, you know, we didn't see it coming, but until what?
[02:57:53.849 --> 02:57:58.412]  The 50s or 60s, we started waking up when they started killing everybody and getting away with it.
[02:57:58.592 --> 02:58:12.855]  Well, that's the thing, you know, America's always had problems, but as it got more and more corrupt, then the worst guy in the room becomes the boss, and then somebody worse replaces that group, and pretty soon you've got a bunch of people that want tyranny just because it's fun to exercise the power.
[02:58:13.235 --> 02:58:21.577]  Yeah, they're sociopaths, and, you know, it's about the money, but it's also about this power and this delight.
[02:58:22.437 --> 02:58:24.518]  And this is, I'm talking in psychological terms.
[02:58:24.578 --> 02:58:25.598]  I have studied this very deeply.
[02:58:27.639 --> 02:58:28.899]  Well, hold on, we've got to go to break.
[02:58:28.919 --> 02:58:33.340]  We're going to come right back with Richard Belzer to talk about The Delight on the other side.
[02:58:33.380 --> 02:58:38.182]  If your station doesn't carry it, audio streams and video at prisonplanet.tv and fullwars.com.

[02:58:50.484 --> 02:58:56.306]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our immunity and health.
[02:58:57.225 --> 02:59:03.128]  At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of silver-based products.

[02:59:19.076 --> 02:59:25.259]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.
[02:59:25.979 --> 02:59:36.421]  But rather we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the silver more effectively.

[02:59:54.166 --> 02:59:57.448]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[02:59:57.468 --> 02:59:58.109]  Big Brother.
[03:00:05.658 --> 03:00:06.679]  Mainstream media.
[03:00:07.420 --> 03:00:08.521]  Government cover-ups.
[03:00:09.182 --> 03:00:10.003]  You want answers?
[03:00:10.764 --> 03:00:11.645]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:12.306 --> 03:00:15.990]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:16.511 --> 03:00:20.556]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:23.217 --> 03:00:27.001]  Hey Richard, I want to get you on the nightly news in the next few weeks.
[03:00:27.041 --> 03:00:27.902]  Let's set this up.
[03:00:27.942 --> 03:00:28.963]  Richard Belzer is our guest.
[03:00:29.444 --> 03:00:33.708]  To go over all 50 people you put in the book that were mysteriously murdered.
[03:00:35.049 --> 03:00:36.251]  So we'll set that up after the show today.
[03:00:36.271 --> 03:00:40.395]  I want to apologize to your listeners because I do go on and I really want to, you know...
[03:00:40.575 --> 03:00:41.356]  You do not go on.
[03:00:41.376 --> 03:00:44.599]  In between me bringing up points and the callers, you're absolutely kicking butt.
[03:00:44.659 --> 03:00:55.448]  No, I want to get you on to really go over where you see society going on the TV shows so that we have, you know, like an hour between commercials and I can do an extensive in-depth interview with you.
[03:00:55.488 --> 03:01:04.216]  But finishing up before we take a few more final calls, you were making a point about the delight, the establishment takes a delight in, and then the break cuts you off.
[03:01:04.596 --> 03:01:07.319]  Yeah, what I'm studying now for my next book
[03:01:08.417 --> 03:01:13.942]  is to what extent are true sociopathic personalities dominating governments today?
[03:01:14.442 --> 03:01:16.044]  And why do people tolerate them?
[03:01:16.744 --> 03:01:17.285]  You know what I mean?
[03:01:17.345 --> 03:01:22.029]  It's like, there's a great book about the shaping of collective memory.
[03:01:22.389 --> 03:01:23.910]  It's like, who owns the story?
[03:01:24.411 --> 03:01:24.951]  You know what I mean?
[03:01:25.051 --> 03:01:30.796]  Tom Wicker, Dan Rather, George Will, like four or five reporters, you know, they covered the Kennedy murder in 63.
[03:01:31.216 --> 03:01:36.481]  They don't own the narrative anymore, so what they're trying to do is just scramble the narrative where there is no narrative.
[03:01:36.741 --> 03:01:37.681]  That's exactly right.
[03:01:38.362 --> 03:01:44.224]  But people are still holding on to this narrative, you know, out of institutional embarrassment.
[03:01:44.244 --> 03:01:51.247]  That's why I think the corporate press is not just saying, OK, come on, you know, more than one person was involved.
[03:01:51.767 --> 03:01:53.408]  OK, you know, they won't even say that.
[03:01:54.228 --> 03:01:56.429]  And it's out of ins... because they blew the story.
[03:01:57.089 --> 03:02:07.333]  And, you know, all these great reporters, you know, have not... Even Congress, as you know, in the investigation nobody talks about, found it was a conspiracy.
[03:02:08.053 --> 03:02:10.914]  And if they get caught on this, it's over for them.
[03:02:11.806 --> 03:02:15.828]  Well, you know, a lot of people that were involved are no longer with us.
[03:02:16.348 --> 03:02:19.190]  There's no danger to the national security.
[03:02:19.630 --> 03:02:28.594]  I think it's an insult to the American people and patronizing and contemptuous to just officially keep, you know, denying this reality.
[03:02:28.634 --> 03:02:32.216]  This, this is the one of the ghostliest parts of our history.
[03:02:32.536 --> 03:02:35.558]  The Kennedy assassination was not taught in schools.
[03:02:35.638 --> 03:02:37.339]  It's one sentence or one paragraph.
[03:02:37.699 --> 03:02:41.041]  You know, it's like very mysterious because it exposes
[03:02:41.741 --> 03:02:51.448]  Who we are, this national security state, that can kill a president, get away with it, brainwash a good deal of the public, and shame those that question it.
[03:02:51.848 --> 03:03:04.117]  You know, it's a classic German, and I hate to keep doing this, but it's classic propaganda where, you know, the big lie, you know, it's a cliche but it's true, you know, Goebbels said,
[03:03:04.557 --> 03:03:06.578]  You know, it's easy to control a country.
[03:03:06.678 --> 03:03:11.261]  All you have to do is invent a threat from the outside, and then demonize those who question it.
[03:03:11.281 --> 03:03:16.384]  I'm paraphrasing, but, you know, and that's what they do, and they're doing it now.
[03:03:16.584 --> 03:03:18.125]  It's like, it's scary.
[03:03:18.365 --> 03:03:28.591]  This thing about, you know, them busting the whistleblowers is really chilling stuff, because everyone thought, oh, well, Obama's not going to be, you know, like Bush or whoever.
[03:03:29.131 --> 03:03:30.052]  There's only one party.
[03:03:30.092 --> 03:03:31.853]  It's the, you know, it's the Republicans.
[03:03:32.673 --> 03:04:00.428]  I mean, Obama is going after the press like no president's ever done, and going after government people that expose, you know, stealing money, and then they go, no, we can steal the money, you're going to jail, or... Your analogy of that bank that got busted for laundering money, you know, and they paid a little fine, it was like if your eye went in and held up a bank and got five million and they said, alright, give us a hundred grand and we'll let you go.
[03:04:01.008 --> 03:04:03.209]  Exactly, but we did the math.
[03:04:04.050 --> 03:04:07.131]  It was something like the equivalent, I think, of $3,000 out of a million.
[03:04:07.531 --> 03:04:14.114]  If you stole a million, it was Wachovia and Wells Fargo, $378 billion in laundered money, and they paid a $101 million fine.
[03:04:14.475 --> 03:04:14.915]  That's a joke.
[03:04:14.975 --> 03:04:15.335]  It's a joke.
[03:04:24.344 --> 03:04:27.187]  And, um... It's like giving the cop a tip.
[03:04:27.467 --> 03:04:32.551]  Like, the cops help you bring the bags of money out to 15 vans, and then you give the cop a tip.
[03:04:33.172 --> 03:04:35.794]  It's like, thank you for helping me with that.
[03:04:36.195 --> 03:04:36.455]  Yeah.
[03:04:37.075 --> 03:04:37.996]  Can I do that in my act?
[03:04:39.057 --> 03:04:39.598]  Absolutely.
[03:04:39.638 --> 03:04:40.158]  Hey, stay there.
[03:04:40.178 --> 03:04:42.901]  I'm going to come back to one more segment with you, because I promise to go to Richard.
[03:04:42.921 --> 03:04:43.982]  We're going to talk about gun control.
[03:04:44.602 --> 03:04:50.031]  Alex in Louisiana, Restaurant Filming Police, Chad in Iowa, David in Colorado, and Nick in Connecticut.
[03:04:50.051 --> 03:04:56.861]  We're going to just take those five, six calls, and then that's it, because we're doing the nightly news tonight, 7 o'clock Central, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:04:56.881 --> 03:04:57.802]  Get the book, Hit List.
[03:05:00.089 --> 03:05:01.230]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:01.490 --> 03:05:11.917]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[03:05:12.157 --> 03:05:16.280]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.
[03:05:16.620 --> 03:05:19.102]  But we can't do that without your help.
[03:05:19.382 --> 03:05:30.009]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at InfoWars.com, you will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[03:05:30.629 --> 03:05:33.970]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[03:05:34.110 --> 03:05:39.952]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[03:05:40.252 --> 03:05:49.755]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[03:05:50.155 --> 03:05:51.315]  The war is here.
[03:05:51.656 --> 03:05:53.056]  It's an info war.
[03:05:53.556 --> 03:05:55.477]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[03:05:59.918 --> 03:06:04.021]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[03:06:04.682 --> 03:06:06.823]  I want you to know some very important information.
[03:06:07.724 --> 03:06:16.050]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[03:06:16.690 --> 03:06:21.594]  Now, 27 years later, carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[03:06:22.219 --> 03:06:33.182]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.
[03:06:33.582 --> 03:06:40.604]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[03:06:41.284 --> 03:06:45.549]  Call 1-866-VENUSFLY or order from carnivora.com.
[03:06:45.569 --> 03:06:48.752]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.

[03:06:56.439 --> 03:06:57.440]  Protect your immune system.
[03:06:57.721 --> 03:06:58.742]  It's the only one you've got.
[03:06:59.302 --> 03:07:01.405]  Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins.
[03:07:01.665 --> 03:07:07.932]  Amino acids have to be delivered to your body in the shape that nature gave them, if they are to be used to create new proteins in your body.
[03:07:08.272 --> 03:07:16.301]  Just like a bricklayer cannot use bent or twisted bricks to build a brick wall, so too your body cannot use bent or twisted amino acids to build new proteins.
[03:07:16.801 --> 03:07:20.905]  Giving your body an undamaged amino acid food can make a huge difference in your health.
[03:07:21.586 --> 03:07:25.429]  One World Way is an undamaged amino acid food unlike any other.
[03:07:25.710 --> 03:07:33.457]  You see, heating bends and twists amino acids and all whey protein powders we've investigated and most proteins you consume are heated.
[03:07:33.837 --> 03:07:37.399]  With our True Cool process, you now have a choice with One World Way.
[03:07:37.739 --> 03:07:38.639]  My name is Daniel.
[03:07:38.759 --> 03:07:39.940]  I'm 34 years old.
[03:07:39.980 --> 03:07:43.701]  When I started using One World Way, I weighed 228 pounds.
[03:07:43.961 --> 03:07:46.603]  Now, after two and a half months, I weigh 182 pounds.
[03:07:46.923 --> 03:07:48.764]  This is my ideal weight.
[03:07:48.944 --> 03:07:53.666]  I've noticed an increase in stamina, rate of recovery from workouts, and an increase in my potency.
[03:07:53.926 --> 03:07:55.467]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit oneworldway.com.
[03:08:00.285 --> 03:08:02.486]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:08:03.026 --> 03:08:05.888]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:06.868 --> 03:08:08.529]  Well, it's terrible news.
[03:08:09.249 --> 03:08:12.411]  But I hope it's a gas main or something not terror-related.
[03:08:12.911 --> 03:08:15.192]  Explosion at the Boston Marathon.
[03:08:15.592 --> 03:08:17.393]  We'll punch up some feeds of this.
[03:08:17.433 --> 03:08:18.354]  We're in overdrive.
[03:08:18.854 --> 03:08:19.394]  We're live.
[03:08:19.414 --> 03:08:21.975]  It's 2-0-8 Central.
[03:08:21.995 --> 03:08:24.176]  And two explosions at Boston Marathon.
[03:08:24.837 --> 03:08:26.757]  People hurt in large explosions.
[03:08:27.018 --> 03:08:27.538]  Oh, man.
[03:08:29.079 --> 03:08:29.820]  Oh my gosh.
[03:08:29.860 --> 03:08:32.863]  Are they going to blame it on Iran?
[03:08:32.903 --> 03:08:34.044]  Blame it on the Patriot group?
[03:08:35.064 --> 03:08:36.786]  Or is it going to be a veteran or something?
[03:08:36.846 --> 03:08:38.227]  I mean, this is just so horrible.
[03:08:39.709 --> 03:08:46.755]  And again, I hope nobody's really been hurt bad and I also hope it's a gas main or something like that.
[03:08:47.996 --> 03:08:51.980]  Because they will, again, they're going to turn all public events, first it's have checkpoints,
[03:08:52.660 --> 03:09:08.740]  At the airport, then it's the mall, then it's the sports stadium, then it's the hotel, then it's the highway, then it's the bus station, this is already in Austin, then it's Army at the Kite Festival, then it's, oh, any event has to have, you know, troops at it.
[03:09:09.676 --> 03:09:11.518]  Two explosions at Boston Marathon.
[03:09:11.538 --> 03:09:13.580]  CNN producer, people hurt in large explosions.
[03:09:14.000 --> 03:09:15.562]  Obviously, nightly news tonight.
[03:09:16.062 --> 03:09:17.023]  Nightly news tonight.
[03:09:17.924 --> 03:09:20.126]  We'll have more details on this 7 o'clock central.
[03:09:20.146 --> 03:09:21.107]  I'm so sick of this.
[03:09:21.848 --> 03:09:28.094]  You know, Richard Belzer, journalist, best-selling author, researcher, movie star, TV star.
[03:09:29.295 --> 03:09:30.296]  It's kind of a side job.
[03:09:30.316 --> 03:09:31.958]  He's got a new book out, Hit List.
[03:09:32.739 --> 03:09:44.111]  Knowing how much they use false flags, and of course I should give people the website, it's bellsorbook.com or ibellz.com, like ibellz.com, i-b-e-l-z.com.
[03:09:44.472 --> 03:09:47.775]  I'm Alex Jones with infowars.com, author of I'm Not a Cop.
[03:09:48.876 --> 03:09:57.102]  And any other co-authored how to be a stand-up comic and dead wrong his most recently hit list and He joins us right now.
[03:09:57.202 --> 03:09:58.843]  He's a talk show us as well.
[03:09:58.863 --> 03:10:04.648]  He's on everything So oh and he in the film he was wait a minute Belzer.
[03:10:05.228 --> 03:10:06.269]  I'm gonna show my ignorance
[03:10:07.269 --> 03:10:08.510]  You were in Scarface?
[03:10:08.990 --> 03:10:09.390]  Oh yeah.
[03:10:09.650 --> 03:10:12.391]  I was on stage at the Babylon Club when they... No, no, that's right!
[03:10:13.031 --> 03:10:16.652]  It's Hiding in Plain View when they try to kill Tony.
[03:10:16.672 --> 03:10:20.173]  And you're going, everybody, let's give it to... and they're making fun of Cubans.
[03:10:20.673 --> 03:10:20.933]  Right.
[03:10:21.213 --> 03:10:22.594]  Oh my gosh, you're even cooler.
[03:10:23.414 --> 03:10:25.015]  Oh my, now I'm really jealous.
[03:10:25.935 --> 03:10:27.335]  Oh man, it's one of my favorite movies.
[03:10:27.595 --> 03:10:28.776]  And of course you're in that.
[03:10:29.096 --> 03:10:30.116]  Of course you're in that.
[03:10:30.176 --> 03:10:30.936]  Yeah, that's you.
[03:10:31.457 --> 03:10:32.757]  That's me with my Reagan hair.
[03:10:34.252 --> 03:10:34.852]  Oh my gosh.
[03:10:34.912 --> 03:10:44.577]  Anyways, uh... You mentioned before about what we have to keep our eye on in this marathon story is the very first official reaction.
[03:10:44.737 --> 03:10:45.938]  Yeah, guys, save these recordings.
[03:10:45.978 --> 03:10:46.698]  Save all the recordings.
[03:10:46.738 --> 03:10:47.339]  Record everywhere.
[03:10:47.879 --> 03:10:48.079]  What?
[03:10:48.579 --> 03:10:49.840]  I'm telling the crew, record everywhere.
[03:10:51.089 --> 03:10:52.070]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:10:52.210 --> 03:10:54.031]  How are they going to paint this?
[03:10:54.731 --> 03:10:57.473]  I'm working with veterans now.
[03:10:57.973 --> 03:11:09.120]  I convinced the show I'm on, Law and Order, Special Victims Unit, to do an episode about a vet who had PTSD.
[03:11:09.781 --> 03:11:16.005]  And they tried to disparage him on the stand because he was having flashbacks and stuff.
[03:11:16.205 --> 03:11:19.507]  But he gathered himself and helped us convict someone.
[03:11:19.927 --> 03:11:22.569]  So, because I wanted to make the vet the hero.
[03:11:22.649 --> 03:11:35.899]  Because when these kids come home, and they are a lot of them kids, and their lives, their limbs, you know, they're shattered, you know, we robbed their money, they have tons of paperwork, you know, it's really obscene.
[03:11:35.979 --> 03:11:43.225]  And when there was a shooting, there was a vet with shots, they said, oh, he's got PTSD.
[03:11:43.705 --> 03:11:45.646]  Nobody with PTSD is shooting anybody.
[03:11:45.967 --> 03:11:48.709]  That disease does not make people shoot people.
[03:11:50.050 --> 03:11:55.135]  Well, they're training the police that vets will target every police department and prepare for this war.
[03:11:55.775 --> 03:12:01.221]  And you know, like I said, Nazi Germany targeted Jews, the Russians targeted other people, the Kulaks, the farmers.
[03:12:01.781 --> 03:12:06.606]  Have you seen all these reports where now Homeland Security says the new enemy is going to be mainline Christians?
[03:12:06.686 --> 03:12:08.728]  I mean, it's so absurd.
[03:12:08.768 --> 03:12:12.432]  It's Drudge now running the headline, explosions at Boston Marathon.
[03:12:13.192 --> 03:12:16.973]  And the Boston Globe, all they have is a Twitter out.
[03:12:17.413 --> 03:12:19.554]  Boston and New England's leading news source.
[03:12:20.574 --> 03:12:22.334]  Green line due to police activity.
[03:12:22.795 --> 03:12:24.115]  GL terminating.
[03:12:25.255 --> 03:12:30.096]  And it goes multiple people injured, at least a dozen injured after explosion.
[03:12:30.116 --> 03:12:34.017]  Man, I hope this isn't a false flag or a real terror attack, Richard.
[03:12:34.598 --> 03:12:36.378]  No, I hope not.
[03:12:36.618 --> 03:12:39.579]  But, you know, they're going to use it
[03:12:40.479 --> 03:12:45.503]  Even if it's innocent, they will use it because everyone's focused on it now.
[03:12:46.123 --> 03:12:52.587]  And people can be controlled when they're all on the same emotion at the same time.
[03:12:52.607 --> 03:12:56.930]  You know, the government's been studying this since, you know, World War I, how to manipulate us.
[03:12:57.010 --> 03:12:57.431]  Exactly.
[03:12:57.491 --> 03:13:01.333]  Nobody's supposed to be upset about all the murder and death going on with the globalists.
[03:13:01.694 --> 03:13:06.277]  They unfreeze our emotions, though, at certain times and tell us when we're supposed to get upset.
[03:13:06.997 --> 03:13:11.781]  That's so exactly classic, you know, mind control.
[03:13:11.821 --> 03:13:13.743]  And, you know, people used to call me crazy.
[03:13:13.803 --> 03:13:22.630]  But, you know, in 1954, they had the thing Operation Mockingbird, where they were figuring out how to see through your television.
[03:13:22.730 --> 03:13:23.511]  Okay, 1954.
[03:13:24.231 --> 03:13:25.793]  So what do you think they do now?
[03:13:25.993 --> 03:13:32.098]  I mean, they probably have, you know, cameras in our bathrooms to see what we excrete, and then arrest us.
[03:13:34.509 --> 03:13:39.093]  Let's just fade up the Communist News Channel, more like the Corporate News Channel.
[03:13:40.273 --> 03:13:41.193]  Let's fade this up.
[03:13:41.253 --> 03:13:55.039]  There's a whole process underway right now, but the reality of the situation is it is almost impossible to protect an event, especially one that is over a protracted space as a marathon is.
[03:13:55.279 --> 03:13:58.580]  And, you know, I hate to say it, but these are the times that we live in.
[03:13:59.260 --> 03:14:01.261]  Richard, that's what they're saying on CNN.
[03:14:01.901 --> 03:14:04.042]  So they're already basically saying it's a terror attack.
[03:14:04.182 --> 03:14:04.942]  Oh, my goodness.
[03:14:05.643 --> 03:14:06.943]  We're helpless is what he's saying.
[03:14:07.463 --> 03:14:08.864]  That's so they can control us more.
[03:14:09.224 --> 03:14:12.566]  Now, Alex, I think I mentioned this last time I was on, but it bears repeating.
[03:14:13.226 --> 03:14:27.974]  During the Iraq War, PSYOP officers from Fort Detrick, Maryland, were in CNN every day, writing copy, approving stories and shaping, you know, the vision of the war.
[03:14:28.254 --> 03:14:30.595]  So I'm sure, you know, they never went over.
[03:14:30.695 --> 03:14:31.856]  They say, well, that was just that.
[03:14:32.296 --> 03:14:33.096]  They're still there.
[03:14:33.336 --> 03:14:34.017]  You know, this is
[03:14:35.185 --> 03:14:37.369]  Well, you know what I'm talking about.
[03:14:43.404 --> 03:14:45.785]  World Net Daily and Washington Post broke it at the time.
[03:14:46.045 --> 03:14:47.946]  World Net Daily first forced Washington Post.
[03:14:48.767 --> 03:14:50.687]  And of course, Drudge carried it way back then.
[03:14:51.148 --> 03:14:57.131]  And of course, have you seen the White House Chief Advisor to Obama saying how horrible Drudge is because they can't control the narratives?
[03:14:57.391 --> 03:14:59.092]  I mean, they're worried about one website.
[03:14:59.392 --> 03:15:03.654]  I think that's the good news, is it shows that the Emperor is wearing no clothes.
[03:15:03.994 --> 03:15:11.418]  If they're worried about DrudgeReport.com, if they're worried about Richard Belzer, they're worried about Alex Jones, they're worried about all of us not following along.
[03:15:11.618 --> 03:15:20.321]  We just saw a video, by the way, for radio listeners at CNN showing cell phone footage already uploaded showing what looks like a pretty good size explosion and smoke.
[03:15:21.001 --> 03:15:22.782]  And so, and they're saying at least a dozen.
[03:15:22.882 --> 03:15:23.862]  Oh, this looks really bad.
[03:15:23.902 --> 03:15:25.303]  Looks like somebody blew up bleachers.
[03:15:25.563 --> 03:15:26.003]  Oh, no.
[03:15:26.986 --> 03:15:29.027]  Oh my God, I'm so sick of this.
[03:15:29.127 --> 03:15:31.869]  And there's no word on who's claiming responsibility?
[03:15:32.229 --> 03:15:36.271]  Who knows, but I know this, they got TSA ready to roll out nationwide.
[03:15:36.551 --> 03:15:42.534]  They're already doing it, but they've been, I've talked to insiders, they're going to be everywhere now, just federal checkpoints.
[03:15:43.094 --> 03:15:46.896]  I mean, can you believe this is, as if you're going to stop anybody that wants to bomb something.
[03:15:47.375 --> 03:15:53.824]  Well, I'm actually getting a little sick to my stomach because when he said, you know, unfortunately these are the times we live in.
[03:15:54.605 --> 03:16:02.576]  So then when we see soldiers at our kids' Little League game, we see soldiers, you know, everywhere.
[03:16:03.357 --> 03:16:04.818]  Well, we're supposed to feel safe?
[03:16:05.078 --> 03:16:05.519]  Exactly.
[03:16:05.579 --> 03:16:07.621]  Notice how they've been already acclimating.
[03:16:08.081 --> 03:16:10.883]  Notice how they've already been in the news going.
[03:16:11.003 --> 03:16:13.285]  And soldiers are now at the kite festivals.
[03:16:13.645 --> 03:16:15.046]  They're at barbecues.
[03:16:15.086 --> 03:16:17.128]  They're searching people.
[03:16:17.488 --> 03:16:21.672]  And I've been telling people, they're getting ready to hit soft targets all over the country.
[03:16:21.692 --> 03:16:23.013]  People say, well, who's the main...
[03:16:24.834 --> 03:16:26.514]  Well, who stands to gain?
[03:16:26.955 --> 03:16:35.117]  When the government and the shadow government has been gearing up to roll out and be our savior, and they stand to gain from it, it's obvious.
[03:16:35.197 --> 03:16:42.178]  I mean, who's the number one suspect in this, Richard Belzer, as a journalist, as a crime writer in the past?
[03:16:43.379 --> 03:16:49.260]  Whoever the suspect is, the government will appropriate it and create a narrative.
[03:16:50.329 --> 03:17:02.679]  And 90% of it probably, I'm just guessing, will be a fabrication to shape our thought of police and military and safety and they're licking their chops.
[03:17:02.759 --> 03:17:07.483]  Even if this was a gas main, they still got to study how we reacted.
[03:17:08.183 --> 03:17:13.167]  And that's what they're, you know, that's why even, you know, events that they don't do, they study.
[03:17:13.387 --> 03:17:15.809]  Yeah, I mean, it could have been a truck running over a gas main.
[03:17:15.869 --> 03:17:20.013]  I mean, all the time I see in the paper, a gas main blows up, kills 30 people.
[03:17:20.273 --> 03:17:21.314]  It's not even in the news.
[03:17:21.374 --> 03:17:23.896]  It's like back of the paper, you know, barely a blur.
[03:17:24.316 --> 03:17:29.820]  But I guarantee you, if five people die from this, all you'll hear is Pelmel Pavlovian.
[03:17:29.840 --> 03:17:31.762]  Be scared of the random man.
[03:17:31.802 --> 03:17:32.262]  Be scared.
[03:17:32.302 --> 03:17:33.403]  Only we can save you.
[03:17:33.663 --> 03:17:36.666]  I mean, just the response shows how fake all this is.
[03:17:36.966 --> 03:17:53.109]  Yeah, you know, I'm going to predict that the hook for them is going to be, these are the times we live in, you know, and everyone will just surrender and let them, you know, uh... How much do you want to bet if you tune into all five networks, they're going to be saying, these are the times we live in, these are the times, exactly, they've always got some way.
[03:17:53.309 --> 03:17:56.590]  We've got to give all our rights up now, this is the end of America as we knew it, 9-11.
[03:17:56.830 --> 03:17:57.110]  Why?
[03:17:57.490 --> 03:18:01.451]  Why give up all my rights because of another made-up narrative?
[03:18:02.338 --> 03:18:10.380]  Yeah, and you know, it's interesting because clearly there are bad people, but there aren't millions of them or even thousands.
[03:18:10.760 --> 03:18:11.300]  You know what I mean?
[03:18:11.340 --> 03:18:15.861]  There's probably a few hundred people that are really demonic and crazy and might hurt us.
[03:18:16.261 --> 03:18:22.243]  You don't imprison 310 million people because there's a few hundred, you know, people that are, you know,
[03:18:22.583 --> 03:18:23.364]  Whatever they are.
[03:18:23.684 --> 03:18:25.866]  Drug addicts or crazy or I mean I don't know.
[03:18:26.366 --> 03:18:34.654]  But it's like we still have to take our shoes off because some plant from our government had this device that wouldn't have taken down the plane anyway.
[03:18:34.674 --> 03:18:35.335]  That's another thing.
[03:18:35.855 --> 03:18:46.685]  Even the New York Times and even the Washington Globe of all places have done reports the last few years about the hundred plus fake FBI deals where they find 75 IQ mentally ill people
[03:18:47.185 --> 03:18:53.168]  And then have them build a bomb and say, now blow up the Christmas tree just to take over the Christmas coverage.
[03:18:53.768 --> 03:19:04.414]  And every, I mean, I could go out, I would never do it, I don't want them to edit that, and find a mentally ill person, Richard, and for $10,000 have them, you know, drive a bomb wherever I want it.
[03:19:04.454 --> 03:19:06.735]  I mean, the schizophrenic victims are everywhere.
[03:19:07.435 --> 03:19:13.278]  No, that's an excellent point because, you know, they know who to target and who to recruit.
[03:19:13.818 --> 03:19:29.706]  You know, like a lot of people, like you said before, Oswald was probably recruited much sooner than we ever suspected, but he was clearly chosen, you know, to be a fake defector and to have these false IDs and, you know, he was much, one of them anyway, was very intelligent.
[03:19:30.186 --> 03:19:31.207]  And the other one may have been
[03:19:31.767 --> 03:19:34.709]  No, not as... Well, the good news is... Let's do one more segment.
[03:19:34.749 --> 03:19:35.810]  Richard Bell's our guest.
[03:19:36.330 --> 03:19:40.553]  And sorry to callers, I've got breaking news here, but I'll try to get to you, David and Colorado and others.
[03:19:41.634 --> 03:19:51.401]  Man, I tell you, all I know is they're like building up, like, get ready for soft target attacks at, David said, marathons, sporting events, malls.
[03:19:51.682 --> 03:19:53.963]  We've got to search and body scan you at malls.
[03:19:54.344 --> 03:19:55.865]  You get ready, it's going to happen.
[03:19:57.126 --> 03:19:58.587]  Oh man, this is so out of control.
[03:19:59.628 --> 03:20:01.289]  Introducing Pro-1.

[03:20:48.260 --> 03:20:50.303]  And sodium hexafluorosilicate.

[03:21:05.134 --> 03:21:06.195]  We need assistance.
[03:21:06.575 --> 03:21:07.115]  Please!
[03:21:07.395 --> 03:21:10.697]  Those we should be able to depend on let us down.
[03:21:10.977 --> 03:21:17.100]  Federal and state and local officials saying help is on the way, while the folks here in Bell Harbor say show me.
[03:21:17.360 --> 03:21:19.721]  Don't depend on the government to save you.
[03:21:19.881 --> 03:21:23.463]  Take action now so that you're prepared for the next disaster.
[03:21:23.763 --> 03:21:26.945]  We are hurting down here and we need help.
[03:21:46.170 --> 03:21:46.992]  Immediately!
[03:21:47.052 --> 03:21:51.419]  Before it's time to survive, it's time to prepare.
[03:21:51.840 --> 03:21:56.227]  MyPatriotSupply.com MyPatriotSupply.com

[03:22:28.397 --> 03:22:29.478]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[03:22:29.638 --> 03:22:34.041]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[03:22:34.221 --> 03:22:39.905]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[03:22:40.025 --> 03:22:43.427]  Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[03:22:43.667 --> 03:22:46.269]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[03:22:46.489 --> 03:22:51.292]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[03:22:51.432 --> 03:22:51.673]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:22:51.733 --> 03:22:53.074]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[03:22:58.497 --> 03:23:00.518]  It's time for a home security quiz.
[03:23:00.878 --> 03:23:13.884]  What effective home security device is smaller than a coffee cup, fakes out burglars into thinking someone is home at your house while you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is recommended by many police departments, and sells for less than $30?
[03:23:14.964 --> 03:23:16.645]  Yes, it's fake TV.
[03:23:16.885 --> 03:23:19.046]  This year, about 1 in every 50 U.S.
[03:23:19.066 --> 03:23:25.168]  homes will have a break-in with burglars usually picking the easy target, a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[03:23:25.488 --> 03:23:33.511]  Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look like someone is home watching TV by simulating the light from a real TV.
[03:23:34.071 --> 03:23:39.555]  Fake TV could be the difference between coming home to a secure house or one that's been ransacked.
[03:23:39.775 --> 03:23:46.640]  To get your fake TV for only $29.95 with free shipping, go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.
[03:23:46.660 --> 03:23:46.920]  That's 877-532-5388.
[03:23:46.940 --> 03:23:47.620]  Or go to faketv.com.
[03:23:47.720 --> 03:23:49.882]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[03:24:11.598 --> 03:24:19.864]  And we're going to try to stop the wave of false flag terror that's going to be blamed on us before it happens, but it looks like that hasn't been the case.
[03:24:20.144 --> 03:24:21.505]  This may be blamed on Iran.
[03:24:22.586 --> 03:24:26.789]  If they try to blame it on Al-Qaeda, I'm not putting up with it when the government runs Al-Qaeda publicly.
[03:24:27.526 --> 03:24:36.430]  I mean, and just wait, like I said at the start of the show, until they start shooting down aircraft with the 10,000 heat-seeking missiles given to them by our government when they took over Libya.
[03:24:36.510 --> 03:24:39.031]  I mean, and ladies and gentlemen, I'm looking at Twitter photos.
[03:24:39.571 --> 03:24:41.812]  If you've got children in the room, don't watch our video stream.
[03:24:42.353 --> 03:24:43.993]  People's arms, legs blown off.
[03:24:44.834 --> 03:24:46.174]  In fact, take down the InfoWars logo.
[03:24:46.194 --> 03:24:49.636]  You can see that guy with his face blown off and his leg blown off at the hip.
[03:24:50.738 --> 03:24:51.538]  Oh my God.
[03:24:51.919 --> 03:24:52.779]  That's war, folks.
[03:24:52.799 --> 03:24:58.162]  When a predator drops a thousand pound bomb on a village, you'll have hundreds of people like soup.
[03:24:58.842 --> 03:25:01.483]  They did that to the Branch Davidians as well with a shape charge.
[03:25:02.183 --> 03:25:07.086]  So, remember when they kill innocent people, they dehumanize them and don't even talk about it.
[03:25:07.586 --> 03:25:12.708]  And CNN and stuff won't show, you know, gun pod helicopter footage of families getting shot.
[03:25:13.049 --> 03:25:15.010]  You put that on YouTube, they take down your account.
[03:25:15.350 --> 03:25:17.851]  But this, they'll be putting all this out.
[03:25:19.236 --> 03:25:21.677]  And you can see from helicopter the blood everywhere.
[03:25:22.537 --> 03:25:37.323]  So what it looks like is, across the street from the bleachers in another seating area, or where a group of hundreds of people were standing to watch, somebody detonated multiple bombs, turning people into what looks like giant troughs of sloppy Joes.
[03:25:37.824 --> 03:25:40.585]  And I'm sorry to have to give details here, look at that, oh my gosh.
[03:25:41.765 --> 03:25:43.206]  It actually knocked people over.
[03:25:44.026 --> 03:25:45.067]  50, 60 yards away.
[03:25:45.127 --> 03:25:47.008]  Looks like it had some shrapnel involved in it.
[03:25:47.408 --> 03:25:48.848]  You can see runners blown over.
[03:25:49.289 --> 03:25:52.550]  Ladies and gentlemen, you know, Richard, let's throw this out.
[03:25:53.831 --> 03:25:55.852]  You know, you have these prosecutors getting killed.
[03:25:55.932 --> 03:26:03.255]  I said Mexican mafia or white supremacists only because those are the groups that usually, who aren't staged, who have the will to kill people.
[03:26:05.016 --> 03:26:07.958]  But with this, Muslim extremists they're going to pin it on?
[03:26:08.298 --> 03:26:10.179]  Or will they pin it on the new enemy, the patriots?
[03:26:10.219 --> 03:26:10.499]  Go ahead.
[03:26:11.175 --> 03:26:15.420]  Well, they have a menu of what will best serve their needs.
[03:26:15.941 --> 03:26:16.682]  I'm with you.
[03:26:16.702 --> 03:26:20.667]  I pray that it's not like Al-Qaeda who we invented.
[03:26:21.468 --> 03:26:25.713]  You know, Osama bin Laden did not use the term Al-Qaeda until after 9-11.
[03:26:26.934 --> 03:26:33.296]  It was invented by us to use the Rico statue to ensnare him in some legal case.
[03:26:33.856 --> 03:26:36.377]  So he was never a mastermind.
[03:26:36.397 --> 03:26:37.117]  They just used him.
[03:26:37.137 --> 03:26:38.538]  He would fund different groups.
[03:26:39.058 --> 03:26:44.560]  Al Qaeda is a myth that we use, as is the Muslim Brotherhood is scarier because they're real Nazis.
[03:26:44.620 --> 03:26:47.861]  The British Foreign Minister said that and they killed him like a week later.
[03:26:47.901 --> 03:26:50.202]  He said it's the name of a code name in a CIA database.
[03:26:50.482 --> 03:26:51.622]  Bin Laden works for us.
[03:26:51.902 --> 03:26:53.283]  Boom, heart attack, week later.
[03:26:54.236 --> 03:26:54.916]  When was that?
[03:26:55.037 --> 03:26:55.957]  That was Robin Cook.
[03:26:55.997 --> 03:26:56.737]  I'm going from memory.
[03:26:56.777 --> 03:26:57.418]  Robin Cook.
[03:26:57.798 --> 03:26:58.558]  Yes, that's right.
[03:26:58.758 --> 03:26:59.239]  That's right.
[03:27:00.039 --> 03:27:10.605]  And so when you tell me that it seems like it was detonated from a different place, this is not an amateur, Alex.
[03:27:11.445 --> 03:27:13.026]  This was no amateur job.
[03:27:13.646 --> 03:27:21.150]  This was meant as an act of terror, either by our government or real terrorists or rogue elements within our government.
[03:27:21.210 --> 03:27:21.911]  You know, it's just
[03:27:22.791 --> 03:27:24.912]  Here we are, you know, speculating on what it is.
[03:27:25.372 --> 03:27:36.158]  We're suspending our natural, instinctive desires and lives and not thinking about sustenance or our families or anything, or anything spiritual.
[03:27:36.198 --> 03:27:39.400]  We're thinking about these limbs and people being exploded.
[03:27:39.500 --> 03:27:42.501]  And it makes us focus in now on all the fear.
[03:27:43.002 --> 03:27:45.323]  You know, they've got to go ahead and take our guns.
[03:27:45.723 --> 03:27:48.905]  What if a terrorist goes to the Boston Marathon with guns next?
[03:27:49.986 --> 03:27:53.170]  Uh, oh my goodness, this is just unbelievable.
[03:27:53.190 --> 03:27:57.275]  Uh, and I mean, have you seen the footage yet of people exploding?
[03:27:57.816 --> 03:28:00.719]  No, I'm afraid to, frankly.
[03:28:01.519 --> 03:28:02.660]  It's going to make me sick.
[03:28:03.220 --> 03:28:12.928]  Because I know that in addition to the human suffering, people, human beings, you know, and that's another thing about the Kennedy assassination, a man was killed that day.
[03:28:13.068 --> 03:28:14.909]  You know, sometimes we lose sight of the fact.
[03:28:15.329 --> 03:28:22.335]  But, you know, human beings have been mangled, and we're all human, so collectively we're going to react to it.
[03:28:22.815 --> 03:28:25.998]  And so for guys like us, it's doubly sickening.
[03:28:26.698 --> 03:28:32.781]  Yeah, I would actually be happy if it was a random person that actually came out, because that's not as scary as a big organized government.
[03:28:32.801 --> 03:28:36.443]  The media always says, Alex says the government did it, because that's not as scary as random people.
[03:28:50.009 --> 03:28:57.595]  No, what's scary is that a big powerful organization's doing it, and then posing as the savior, and getting caught doing it over and over again.
[03:28:57.615 --> 03:29:07.282]  I mean, you talk about Vietnam, in those years from 59 until 64, it's been declassified, hundreds of bombings in the country to be blamed on the communists.
[03:29:09.064 --> 03:29:16.329]  And again, I'm no fan of the communists, because they did stuff like that too, but it's just like, governments just do this, folks.
[03:29:17.338 --> 03:29:25.626]  Well, you know, the Hoover got rid of the FBI because there was a black FBI agent within it that helped bring it down.
[03:29:26.447 --> 03:29:30.530]  Hoover helped Eisenhower, the head of the American Communist Party.
[03:29:30.590 --> 03:29:33.773]  I'm not a fan of the communists either, but he was in the FBI.
[03:29:34.274 --> 03:29:37.096]  Every organization, that's why you have to be careful.
[03:29:37.897 --> 03:29:40.418]  Uh, a lot of organizations... I'll tell you what, finish your point on the other side.
[03:29:40.438 --> 03:29:42.859]  I'm going overdrive this whole hour, and I'll be live tonight.
[03:29:42.879 --> 03:29:46.280]  We're doing InfoWars Nightly News live, and then we'll have the packages after.
[03:29:46.300 --> 03:29:47.441]  7 o'clock Central.
[03:29:49.001 --> 03:29:49.902]  We're on the march.
[03:29:50.402 --> 03:29:52.002]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:52.923 --> 03:29:55.604]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:00.069 --> 03:30:01.210]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[03:30:01.470 --> 03:30:11.917]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.

[03:30:40.236 --> 03:30:49.763]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[03:30:50.143 --> 03:30:51.304]  The war is here.
[03:30:51.644 --> 03:30:53.185]  It's an info war.
[03:30:53.546 --> 03:30:56.208]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[03:31:01.929 --> 03:31:03.610]  Are you still a traditional smoker?

[03:31:59.408 --> 03:32:01.609]  What's safer and cheaper than prescription drugs?
[03:32:02.090 --> 03:32:02.890]  Glad you asked.
[03:32:03.330 --> 03:32:05.392]  The answer is renovation teas.
[03:32:05.712 --> 03:32:09.614]  Herbal remedies are much safer and much cheaper than prescription drugs.
[03:32:09.894 --> 03:32:13.957]  Taste great, and most importantly, herbal teas are effective and non-addictive.
[03:32:14.197 --> 03:32:17.119]  Renovation tea is especially unique, and here's why.
[03:32:17.419 --> 03:32:20.701]  We spent years researching herbs and their beneficial properties.
[03:32:21.181 --> 03:32:25.503]  Renovation Teas uses only 100% organic, fair trade herbs.
[03:32:25.844 --> 03:32:34.488]  Our teas are blended towards specific ailments and health conditions, such as diabetes, blood pressure, anxiety, libido, detox, and much more.

[03:32:50.117 --> 03:32:50.397]  That's 870-784-3121.
[03:32:50.497 --> 03:32:51.598]  Renovation Tees.

[03:33:31.573 --> 03:33:33.934]  Ladies and gentlemen, I said I'd go to your phone calls, and I am.
[03:33:33.994 --> 03:33:41.478]  But I feel like I should wipe these calls clean, even though they've been holding some of them for an hour, to open the phones up for people in Boston.
[03:33:42.138 --> 03:33:47.401]  So what I want John Harmon to do is get these callers' number right now.
[03:33:48.908 --> 03:33:51.652]  And we will call them back tomorrow or later.
[03:33:51.692 --> 03:34:01.444]  We're going to go ahead and go live for at least two more hours today with the video streams at PrisonPlanet.tv and the audio streams at InfoWars.com.
[03:34:02.546 --> 03:34:11.609]  We're going to go ahead and go live, and we're going to have Jakari Jackson and David Knight in here live to take your phone calls and more.
[03:34:11.930 --> 03:34:15.091]  We'll get a couple video reports ready at the start of the next hour.
[03:34:15.511 --> 03:34:16.711]  We're going to go commercial-free.
[03:34:16.731 --> 03:34:18.372]  We need a break while they get in here and get ready.
[03:34:19.252 --> 03:34:22.274]  And then they can also recap, and we'll be feeding them news as it breaks.
[03:34:22.314 --> 03:34:26.155]  And then I'll be able to tell you more at 7 o'clock Central tonight.
[03:34:26.195 --> 03:34:30.837]  I will host InfoWars Nightly News live, which we've done
[03:34:33.164 --> 03:34:34.364]  40, 50 times or so.
[03:34:34.424 --> 03:34:35.625]  So we've done it quite a bit.
[03:34:36.205 --> 03:34:37.926]  We had like a whole month where it was live every night.
[03:34:38.446 --> 03:34:41.367]  So because we're considering live show versus tape show, sometimes it's a mix.
[03:34:41.767 --> 03:34:43.527]  A bunch of special reports and stuff tonight.
[03:34:44.608 --> 03:34:49.769]  Again, I've been telling everybody this in the last few months and longtime listeners know this.
[03:34:50.309 --> 03:34:51.510]  You notice I've turned the heat up.
[03:34:51.630 --> 03:34:52.670]  I've gotten more aggressive.
[03:34:53.110 --> 03:34:54.070]  I've said I'm committed.
[03:34:54.711 --> 03:34:58.672]  And I've also told you, and I've told my wife and the whole crew this, I've never
[03:34:59.927 --> 03:35:00.267]  Never.
[03:35:01.147 --> 03:35:01.467]  Never.
[03:35:01.707 --> 03:35:02.748]  It's not even anxiety.
[03:35:03.028 --> 03:35:14.390]  It's just absolute... The feeling I had a few times in my life where somebody was about to walk around a corner out of the blue and mug me, and you're just like, why do I feel so bummed out?
[03:35:14.450 --> 03:35:15.890]  Why do I feel like there's danger?
[03:35:16.270 --> 03:35:17.250]  And then there it is.
[03:35:17.810 --> 03:35:20.491]  Or you wake up one day and you're driving to work and you go, man, why do I feel weird?
[03:35:20.511 --> 03:35:25.972]  And then you see cars run to each other and kids flying out, you know, on the Dallas Central Expressway.
[03:35:26.552 --> 03:35:27.852]  I've unfortunately probably seen
[03:35:29.113 --> 03:35:33.395]  Seven or eight, I start thinking about it more, fatality crashes in my life.
[03:35:33.895 --> 03:35:37.476]  I've pulled over when arms are chopped off and blood spring, you know, ten feet in the air.
[03:35:39.577 --> 03:35:39.997]  Oh, God.
[03:35:40.757 --> 03:35:42.678]  And I know that feeling right before it happens.
[03:35:42.918 --> 03:35:43.938]  There is a sixth sense.
[03:35:44.579 --> 03:35:48.640]  Ants, you know, birds, mammals even have more of it.
[03:35:48.660 --> 03:35:49.821]  We've just been taught it isn't there.
[03:35:49.841 --> 03:35:55.843]  And, again, the globalists are killing people all over the world, and I'm not feeling a disturbance in the force.
[03:35:56.463 --> 03:36:00.245]  You know, to be sarcastic, but that's really, you know, kind of what they're talking about there.
[03:36:00.265 --> 03:36:01.586]  We all have that, that sixth sense.
[03:36:02.427 --> 03:36:11.772]  I have been seeing a massive buildup, not like it's not obvious, billions of bullets, armored vehicles, prepared to arrest the Christians in mass, state police going public saying this is crazy.
[03:36:13.173 --> 03:36:19.197]  I drive around Austin now, we see TSA checkpoints and National Guard, you know, I can't go to like a
[03:36:20.274 --> 03:36:21.275]  Succulent event.
[03:36:21.655 --> 03:36:23.557]  The city of Austin's succulent event.
[03:36:24.638 --> 03:36:25.538]  In fact, I forgot about this.
[03:36:25.578 --> 03:36:28.521]  I drove by Zilker Park yesterday.
[03:36:28.541 --> 03:36:33.385]  They were having this succulent plant, type of plant event.
[03:36:33.405 --> 03:36:34.305]  We're going to our guest here.
[03:36:35.246 --> 03:36:37.428]  And I looked and I go, there's troops again.
[03:36:37.448 --> 03:36:40.230]  I mean, just troops everywhere!
[03:36:40.971 --> 03:36:44.774]  Okay, this is a rollout ahead of them taking everybody's bank account.
[03:36:45.154 --> 03:36:47.919]  Let me tell all the idiots out there that want to take other people's Second Amendment.
[03:36:48.360 --> 03:36:52.828]  They're going to take your money too and everything.
[03:36:53.429 --> 03:36:56.715]  And I guess it's for me the realization that I've been right about all this.
[03:36:58.092 --> 03:37:01.275]  Not that it was hard to be right, it's just, I get why people are in denial.
[03:37:01.695 --> 03:37:04.137]  Because what do you do when faced with evil?
[03:37:04.738 --> 03:37:10.843]  What do you do when it's just galloping and growing and oozing and threatening and killing?
[03:37:11.443 --> 03:37:18.049]  And again, I hope, now they're saying, they're reporting a bunch of stuff right now, but I mean, it's...
[03:37:20.022 --> 03:37:25.364]  It shows a bunch of piles of bloody people and again, there are, it's not like it's a unicorn.
[03:37:25.665 --> 03:37:26.605]  Unicorns don't exist.
[03:37:26.905 --> 03:37:29.946]  There are real organic terror attacks that happen.
[03:37:29.966 --> 03:37:30.907]  They're very, very rare.
[03:37:30.927 --> 03:37:35.609]  They mainly happen in Israel in places, you know, when a woman goes on a bus and stabs 14 people.
[03:37:35.649 --> 03:37:36.989]  I mean, that's a crime of passion.
[03:37:37.410 --> 03:37:37.970]  That's real.
[03:37:39.210 --> 03:37:41.191]  Uh, but even most of that stuff has come out.
[03:37:41.851 --> 03:37:46.672]  Israel, you know, created fake Al-Qaeda and stuff whenever they want to be able to take rights or something.
[03:37:46.772 --> 03:37:47.753]  All these governments do it.
[03:37:48.093 --> 03:37:56.875]  The Italian Supreme Court Justice I was just talking about, minutes before it happened, he came out last week and said, Bilderberg's staging terror attacks and here are the documents.
[03:37:57.536 --> 03:38:00.096]  We've got to keep an eye on him.
[03:38:00.156 --> 03:38:02.337]  And Richard, I'm ranting here and I want to go to these calls.
[03:38:02.457 --> 03:38:02.857]  No, you're not.
[03:38:02.877 --> 03:38:04.618]  No, you're not.
[03:38:04.638 --> 03:38:05.318]  You're on the money.
[03:38:05.734 --> 03:38:07.836]  No, I'm glad you mentioned the Italian.
[03:38:07.896 --> 03:38:10.018]  Let's see what happens to him in the next month or two.
[03:38:10.038 --> 03:38:12.620]  Oh, he's discredited and demonized.
[03:38:13.081 --> 03:38:21.648]  You know, Machiavelli, he said that what you do is you take a person's best quality and attack that.
[03:38:22.543 --> 03:38:24.585]  You know, not like make up something.
[03:38:25.105 --> 03:38:28.167]  You know, it's so it's like that's what I'm not.
[03:38:28.247 --> 03:38:31.610]  I wasn't a big fan of Kerry, but you know, he did get shot.
[03:38:31.650 --> 03:38:38.115]  He was, you know, he had a uniform on more than Bush did and was in combat, but they made him into a wimp.
[03:38:38.856 --> 03:38:42.659]  You know, it's like you can make people's brains do tricks.
[03:38:42.739 --> 03:38:45.901]  And this thing is exactly like, look at this bad person.
[03:38:46.161 --> 03:38:47.222]  They help children.
[03:38:48.023 --> 03:38:49.544]  That's because they want a grandstand.
[03:38:49.564 --> 03:38:51.525]  You know, they can take anything and spin it.
[03:38:51.565 --> 03:38:51.746]  Yeah.
[03:38:52.466 --> 03:38:54.068]  Yeah, and so we got to be real.
[03:38:54.388 --> 03:39:06.160]  I'm so glad you're staying on because in monitoring this, because as I learned with the assassination of John Kennedy, I studied what was said immediately after.
[03:39:07.110 --> 03:39:23.082]  You know the first 24, 36, 48 hours there was all kinds of stuff that just went away about multiple shooters and guys running away with guns and you know just like and they somehow just scrub all that but that's why I'm glad that you know you have the facility
[03:39:23.562 --> 03:39:32.586]  And the Bullhorn now to cover this event and give the alternative, which now is the real point of view, not the... Well listen, I'll be honest with you.
[03:39:32.627 --> 03:39:34.467]  We're gonna go to people in Massachusetts right now.
[03:39:34.487 --> 03:39:36.028]  We're gonna open the phones up.
[03:39:36.929 --> 03:39:39.370]  But I mean, my point is, I'm gonna be honest with you, Richard.
[03:39:40.763 --> 03:39:44.286]  We're going to go look at what our viewers pick up and what they email us.
[03:39:44.626 --> 03:39:50.410]  They will be the ones, our listeners, that are going to analyze kind of like that real collective resistance in brain.
[03:39:50.870 --> 03:40:02.439]  And by seven o'clock tonight, if there are any obvious signs or the system milking it or unification across all channels with talking points immediately, that'll be the telltale sign.
[03:40:02.979 --> 03:40:05.101]  If people can check their DVRs, folks,
[03:40:05.541 --> 03:40:06.361]  Yeah.
[03:40:06.441 --> 03:40:09.083]  And notice the exact same script in minute one.
[03:40:09.103 --> 03:40:11.544]  Key phrases.
[03:40:12.444 --> 03:40:17.066]  Because sometimes there's real events and different networks will go at different angles and it turns out it's a real event.
[03:40:17.487 --> 03:40:23.389]  If they're all minute one, the same script like 9-11 or JFK, you know the fix is in.
[03:40:24.030 --> 03:40:24.490]  Exactly.
[03:40:25.566 --> 03:40:33.493]  And I have, like you said, I hope it, let us take calls, but I hope it is just some random person and not, you know, a plot to blame.
[03:40:33.513 --> 03:40:38.899]  I'm sure you've heard that talking point where they go, they think the government was involved because they want to believe somebody's in control.
[03:40:39.299 --> 03:40:41.421]  And it's scarier that random people could do this.
[03:40:41.461 --> 03:40:41.861]  What do you mean?
[03:40:41.901 --> 03:40:44.544]  It's a hundred times scarier organized evil.
[03:40:45.204 --> 03:40:45.505]  Yeah.
[03:40:46.741 --> 03:40:49.282]  And random people don't do medical experiments on their own people.
[03:40:49.782 --> 03:40:50.322]  Exactly.
[03:40:50.482 --> 03:40:51.823]  And think how many times our government's done that.
[03:40:52.363 --> 03:41:00.825]  They're not having CNN reports about how scary it is, the thousands of lethal secret tests on little kids, troops, black people.
[03:41:00.845 --> 03:41:00.885]  800-259-9231.
[03:41:01.245 --> 03:41:05.207]  Then we go to the next tower, we'll give out our local number.
[03:41:05.667 --> 03:41:07.267]  It's toll free, but our number here.
[03:41:08.107 --> 03:41:10.768]  And again, our regular phone guy is actually sick today.
[03:41:10.808 --> 03:41:13.769]  We got a bunch of people sick today, so our crew is limited, but we're going to do this.
[03:41:13.809 --> 03:41:15.030]  Great job to the crew, by the way.
[03:41:15.050 --> 03:41:16.230]  You guys are all entering.
[03:41:17.697 --> 03:41:18.278]  Oh my gosh!
[03:41:18.438 --> 03:41:18.998]  Oh my gosh!
[03:41:19.158 --> 03:41:19.759]  Oh my gosh!
[03:41:19.939 --> 03:41:20.479]  Oh my gosh!
[03:41:20.980 --> 03:41:26.164]  I just realized it's Patriots Day in Massachusetts and April 19th is the national one.
[03:41:26.684 --> 03:41:27.685]  Oh my gosh!
[03:41:28.085 --> 03:41:31.448]  That bumps up the death con that they're going to blame it on a Patriot group.
[03:41:31.808 --> 03:41:32.529]  Anyways, I'm sorry.
[03:41:32.569 --> 03:41:33.350]  I'm just brainstorming.
[03:41:33.370 --> 03:41:33.510]  No, no.
[03:41:33.550 --> 03:41:35.191]  That's very astute.
[03:41:35.551 --> 03:41:36.172]  Well, no, no.
[03:41:36.192 --> 03:41:37.032]  John Bowne just said it.
[03:41:37.613 --> 03:41:40.175]  In fact, that's Patriots Day in Massachusetts where it all started.
[03:41:40.195 --> 03:41:43.157]  And then the 19th is a few days later when the big stuff happened.
[03:41:43.478 --> 03:41:44.278]  Folks, here is the
[03:41:45.390 --> 03:41:47.330]  Here is the toll-free number, 800-259-9231.
[03:41:47.990 --> 03:41:51.611]  What have you noticed watching the news?
[03:41:51.631 --> 03:41:56.192]  That's just as important as if you're even in MASH, but particularly if you're in Boston.
[03:41:56.212 --> 03:41:57.972]  I know we have listeners everywhere.
[03:41:57.992 --> 03:42:00.173]  800-259-9231.
[03:42:00.533 --> 03:42:06.514]  Please only call if you have a tidbit of key intel or if you were there or have family that was there.
[03:42:06.534 --> 03:42:07.354]  800-259-9231.
[03:42:07.394 --> 03:42:13.375]  And I pray that those bomb with their legs blown off and their faces blown off survive
[03:42:14.455 --> 03:42:17.777]  And I just pray for everybody, whoever your God is, folks, this is just horrible.
[03:42:18.638 --> 03:42:21.860]  And again, this could be the start of a whole bunch of this stuff, okay?
[03:42:21.880 --> 03:42:29.606]  Because they're saying, the libertarians will start bombing everything, and then if it starts happening and they blame it on us, if it comes out...
[03:42:30.046 --> 03:42:32.227]  And they say it's a libertarian group, folks.
[03:42:32.747 --> 03:42:34.168]  We are in deep crap.
[03:42:34.228 --> 03:42:35.308]  It means they're going ahead with it.
[03:42:35.608 --> 03:42:39.710]  If they say it's Iran, there is no way Iran would pull something like this.
[03:42:40.030 --> 03:42:40.530]  No, they wouldn't.
[03:42:40.910 --> 03:42:42.511]  Knowing that they're going to get clobbered.
[03:42:43.852 --> 03:42:47.373]  My goodness, let's go ahead and talk to Mel and Mass.
[03:42:47.673 --> 03:42:49.554]  You're on the air with Richard Belzer and Alex Jones.
[03:42:49.734 --> 03:42:50.794]  What a day to come on, Richard.
[03:42:51.635 --> 03:42:52.035]  I know.
[03:42:52.095 --> 03:42:54.556]  I mean, it's amazing.
[03:42:54.576 --> 03:42:55.136]  Go ahead, Mel.
[03:42:55.176 --> 03:42:56.176]  You're on the air from Mass.
[03:42:56.216 --> 03:42:57.237]  Where are you in Massachusetts?
[03:42:58.624 --> 03:43:00.286]  I'm in the Worcester area.
[03:43:01.467 --> 03:43:11.521]  I was actually out painting the house and I heard you talk about the marathon and the explosion and I remember I was listening to how you said right away
[03:43:13.223 --> 03:43:15.184]  They said it's the times we live in.
[03:43:15.504 --> 03:43:21.226]  So I came in, I flipped on the Channel 5, and they described, uh, it's organized chaos.
[03:43:21.246 --> 03:43:22.747]  I mean, where have we heard that before?
[03:43:23.367 --> 03:43:30.130]  And, uh, and then they're now, it's almost like they've been listening to your show, because they're like, well, it's too early to say what's going on here.
[03:43:30.370 --> 03:43:31.131]  No, no, it's already begun.
[03:43:31.151 --> 03:43:31.931]  I'm going to put you on hold.
[03:43:32.672 --> 03:43:34.073]  Guys, rewind CNN right now.
[03:43:34.113 --> 03:43:35.194]  Rewind it to that in a minute.
[03:43:35.375 --> 03:43:40.159]  They're now saying, they're now saying, were there right-winger patriot meetings in the area?
[03:43:40.179 --> 03:43:41.180]  Uh-oh.
[03:43:41.460 --> 03:43:41.841]  Uh-oh.
[03:43:42.121 --> 03:43:42.681]  Oh, man.
[03:43:42.781 --> 03:43:43.963]  And that's CNN doing that?
[03:43:45.224 --> 03:43:45.324]  Oh.
[03:43:46.225 --> 03:43:47.806]  Wolf Blitzer, we are in trouble.
[03:43:47.966 --> 03:43:48.507]  Oh, man.
[03:43:48.887 --> 03:43:50.989]  I bet they even dragged me into it with my 1776 line.
[03:43:51.069 --> 03:43:51.369]  And Boston.
[03:43:57.594 --> 03:43:59.096]  I'm sorry Richard, go ahead.
[03:43:59.176 --> 03:44:00.637]  You're right, it's all the symbolism.
[03:44:00.758 --> 03:44:03.681]  Boston, the Tea Party, Patriots Day.
[03:44:03.701 --> 03:44:10.949]  I was saying the whole earlier show that they're going to do a false flag and blame Patriots and I just feel it.
[03:44:11.490 --> 03:44:12.811]  Because a caller said...
[03:44:13.956 --> 03:44:16.418]  Who loses is who shoots first, like Boston.
[03:44:17.019 --> 03:44:18.480]  And I said, yeah, or Bunker Hill.
[03:44:18.900 --> 03:44:21.662]  But I said, yeah, but they'll shoot first and say we did it.
[03:44:21.983 --> 03:44:22.763]  You see what I'm saying?
[03:44:22.983 --> 03:44:24.565]  They'll shoot first for us, Richard.
[03:44:24.985 --> 03:44:31.350]  Yeah, it's like Hitler would kill Polish soldiers and put German uniforms on them and drag them across the border and then invade the country.
[03:44:32.091 --> 03:44:32.571]  Exactly!
[03:44:32.651 --> 03:44:35.914]  Operation Goliwitz, which was part of Operation Himmler.
[03:44:36.554 --> 03:44:37.035]  Exactly.
[03:44:38.044 --> 03:44:39.105]  Oh man, I'm sick of it.
[03:44:39.205 --> 03:44:45.187]  Boy, I tell you, let me ask you this, Richard, I don't know if you believe in this or not, but has your spidey sense been off the chart lately?
[03:44:45.207 --> 03:44:47.488]  Just like, your spidey sense.
[03:44:48.008 --> 03:44:53.971]  You noticed earlier in the day, Matt, any special Patriots Day events going on?
[03:44:54.531 --> 03:44:57.152]  Anything pointing to a special day in Massachusetts?
[03:44:58.174 --> 03:45:00.015]  Well, it's always a special day, Patriots Day.
[03:45:00.075 --> 03:45:04.358]  Everyone gets the day off from work for the most part, and it's two huge events in Boston.
[03:45:04.399 --> 03:45:11.964]  It's not only the Boston Marathon, where 25,000 plus people run, but I believe it's always opening day of Fenway, so you also have that going on.
[03:45:12.064 --> 03:45:17.828]  So it's a traffic nightmare in a way, but it's probably one of the busiest days in downtown Boston.
[03:45:18.449 --> 03:45:23.572]  So it is a holiday, and people, a lot of people don't go to work, and there's no, is there no school today either?
[03:45:23.592 --> 03:45:27.115]  Correct, there's no school on Patriots Day in Massachusetts.
[03:45:27.574 --> 03:45:28.455]  So the kids are home.
[03:45:28.655 --> 03:45:34.218]  They're watching either the marathon or they're watching the Boston Red Sox play over at Fenway Park.
[03:45:34.258 --> 03:45:35.479]  That game is now over.
[03:45:36.319 --> 03:45:41.822]  And notice the bombing happened right where they've got the United Nations display with a bunch of flags.
[03:45:42.463 --> 03:45:45.084]  I'm telling you, Richard, this is looking worse by the minute.
[03:45:45.304 --> 03:45:46.265]  Guys, keep Googling.
[03:45:46.505 --> 03:45:48.666]  Find out if anybody's taking responsibility for this yet.
[03:45:48.887 --> 03:45:49.867]  This is outreach.
[03:45:49.887 --> 03:45:53.249]  I'm sorry, Richard, I asked you if your Spidey sense was starting to tingle lately.
[03:45:53.389 --> 03:45:54.410]  Well, I'm glad you asked me.
[03:45:54.830 --> 03:46:13.004]  It's a good metaphor because I was in France for five weeks writing and I just turned off everything and I started getting depressed, not just for the Kennedy thing, but just for the way, what I've been learning about the degree to which the government
[03:46:13.684 --> 03:46:38.501]  It really controls even more than I thought and I I'm you know, I think I'm up to this Up to date on it, but it got darker and darker and I started sensing that something's gonna happen in this country I don't know what it is It just seems it was seemed inevitable and you know, I I was you know, usually when I go to France, you know It's beautiful and I'm relaxed and but I was depressed there which I never get depressed there.
[03:46:38.521 --> 03:46:41.623]  So you're right there I felt something portentous in the air.
[03:46:41.663 --> 03:46:42.744]  I didn't know what it was.
[03:46:42.804 --> 03:46:43.284]  I thought maybe
[03:46:43.905 --> 03:46:49.714]  Because I'm studying Kennedy so much but I knew it was broader and bigger and this thing is just
[03:46:51.644 --> 03:46:55.246]  You know, it's making me ill, because they're going to use it no matter who did it.
[03:46:55.807 --> 03:46:59.509]  Exactly, and they can blame it on Muslims, Libertarians, Liberals, who knows?
[03:46:59.549 --> 03:47:04.091]  But how dare Wolf Blitzer pose a question like that?
[03:47:04.651 --> 03:47:09.174]  That's directly from Fort Detrick, I guarantee you, to say, was there any Patriot groups there?
[03:47:09.214 --> 03:47:10.895]  Why couldn't he say, were there any Martians there?
[03:47:10.915 --> 03:47:12.355]  Were there any aliens there?
[03:47:12.696 --> 03:47:14.897]  That's a tell, though, that's a tell!
[03:47:16.197 --> 03:47:16.818]  Come on, man!
[03:47:17.890 --> 03:47:20.252]  I gotta get, oh my god, this is red alert.
[03:47:20.292 --> 03:47:21.453]  Let's see what Drudge is saying.
[03:47:21.473 --> 03:47:25.777]  I'm gonna go back to the caller here and then I'll report on what Drudge is saying with Richard Belzer.
[03:47:26.077 --> 03:47:29.020]  Two explosions developing, reportedly three dead.
[03:47:29.060 --> 03:47:29.941]  Okay, bad news.
[03:47:30.481 --> 03:47:32.583]  DrudgeReport.com is reporting three dead.
[03:47:32.923 --> 03:47:35.145]  People missing limbs, yeah, I've seen that video.
[03:47:35.185 --> 03:47:35.906]  We've been showing it.
[03:47:36.326 --> 03:47:38.488]  So be careful out there if you've got your children with you.
[03:47:38.849 --> 03:47:40.770]  Explosions at Boston Marathon.
[03:47:41.471 --> 03:47:44.212]  And then down here, Californians move to ban and seize guns.
[03:47:44.973 --> 03:47:48.735]  Meanwhile, with gold plunging, what could this signify?
[03:47:48.795 --> 03:47:49.415]  Dow skids 200.
[03:47:49.555 --> 03:47:52.016]  Oh my gosh, oh my.
[03:47:52.297 --> 03:47:54.778]  I'm telling you, I told my wife this morning.
[03:47:54.798 --> 03:47:57.979]  I told the listeners when I went on air today.
[03:47:57.999 --> 03:47:59.680]  I told the crew, I can barely do this show.
[03:48:00.321 --> 03:48:08.505]  I mean, I just, every time, they're about to roll out some PSYOP, and I'm not trying to get into mumbo jumbo here, I just can't help it, Richard.
[03:48:09.383 --> 03:48:17.226]  Well, no, your antenna, you're like me, I mean, my antenna's been buzzing for years, but it seems to be getting red hot.
[03:48:17.746 --> 03:48:22.448]  And a constellation of events is occurring all at the same time.
[03:48:22.488 --> 03:48:29.330]  Now, everything we feared, it used to be a little here, a little there, but now you got, you know, busting the whistleblowers, false flag events.
[03:48:29.950 --> 03:48:44.006]  Uh, the drones, uh, you know, putting troops in the street, uh, invading our privacy beyond our, you know, they do listen literally, this is not an exaggeration, they do listen literally to every single phone call in this country.
[03:48:44.046 --> 03:48:44.867]  And they admit it now!
[03:48:45.188 --> 03:48:50.374]  Just six years ago, Bush got caught lying about it, it was a scandal, now it's like, yeah, we're doing, we're watching everything!
[03:48:50.774 --> 03:48:53.378]  Yeah, he said, we have lawyers that, you know, said it was OK.
[03:48:53.458 --> 03:48:54.480]  Yeah, let's go back to Mel.
[03:48:54.500 --> 03:48:55.421]  Mel, I apologize.
[03:48:55.441 --> 03:48:56.643]  Just that breaking news happened.
[03:48:56.983 --> 03:48:59.547]  What do you think of Wolf Blitzer going, oh, it's Patriot Day.
[03:48:59.807 --> 03:49:02.151]  Was there any Patriot events in the area?
[03:49:02.591 --> 03:49:04.494]  I mean, Mel, I'm telling you, this is looking bad.
[03:49:04.755 --> 03:49:05.395]  Mel, go ahead.
[03:49:06.176 --> 03:49:07.417]  Yeah, I agree with you.
[03:49:08.077 --> 03:49:12.060]  You know, it's funny because I forgot today is Patriots Day.
[03:49:12.680 --> 03:49:15.162]  No, it's the income tax day.
[03:49:15.202 --> 03:49:17.584]  Oh, watch him blame an anti-income tax guy.
[03:49:17.824 --> 03:49:20.245]  And notice, they never actually bomb a real target.
[03:49:20.726 --> 03:49:27.190]  It's always the general public so they can scare us and then act like anti-government groups would actually just target the general public.
[03:49:27.210 --> 03:49:27.470]  Go ahead.
[03:49:28.658 --> 03:49:30.799]  Yeah, you know, I agree with you on that.
[03:49:30.939 --> 03:49:36.203]  And it's just fun, you know, like on 9-11 too, I mean, the planes came from Boston.
[03:49:36.483 --> 03:49:42.607]  This is where, you know, when we came across and left England, this is where we started settling, you know, Plymouth Rock and everything.
[03:49:42.647 --> 03:49:44.228]  It's just, I think it's very symbolic.
[03:49:46.742 --> 03:49:51.064]  That's interesting that you mention that, that the planes took off from Boston, how symbolic Boston is.
[03:49:51.744 --> 03:50:00.486]  Because the guys who dressed up like Native Americans and threw boxes of tea in the water just came out of a Mason meeting.
[03:50:02.967 --> 03:50:08.648]  Man, I tell you, the Green Dragon Inn or Green Dragon Bar, man, I tell you, this is just ridiculous.
[03:50:08.688 --> 03:50:10.049]  I'm almost speechless at this point.
[03:50:10.129 --> 03:50:10.709]  I'm going to have to
[03:50:11.434 --> 03:50:14.115]  Regroup, get the other crew in here after we take some more calls.
[03:50:14.236 --> 03:50:15.676]  Richard, we'll get you out of here in about 6-7 minutes.
[03:50:15.696 --> 03:50:16.437]  Whatever you need, Alex.
[03:50:16.457 --> 03:50:17.157]  Whatever you need.
[03:50:17.177 --> 03:50:20.119]  We're about to go to break and I've got to go probably just lay down.
[03:50:20.559 --> 03:50:20.879]  Please.
[03:50:21.079 --> 03:50:21.739]  I'm going to.
[03:50:21.900 --> 03:50:22.800]  Yeah, I know.
[03:50:22.820 --> 03:50:27.342]  I'm going to just lay down, reset, and just try to, you know, because here's the deal, guys.
[03:50:27.443 --> 03:50:28.663]  It's the darkness growing.
[03:50:28.723 --> 03:50:30.284]  I mean, you can feel it.
[03:50:32.611 --> 03:50:34.272]  Oh, I tell you, we got a bunch of other news.
[03:50:34.373 --> 03:50:37.075]  CNN, two blasted Boston Marathon have injured six people.
[03:50:37.515 --> 03:50:38.896]  Three dead, they're now reporting.
[03:50:40.258 --> 03:50:43.320]  One of the bombs came from a dumpster-type can by the restaurant.
[03:50:43.400 --> 03:50:44.341]  One was inside a building.
[03:50:44.441 --> 03:50:47.083]  Third possible at a Meridian Hotel.
[03:50:47.103 --> 03:50:50.106]  So, they're now talking about three bombs, at least three dead.
[03:50:50.506 --> 03:50:55.951]  Continual coverage with video feeds at InfoWars.com, PrisonBlinded.com, and DrugsReport.com.
[03:50:56.031 --> 03:50:58.213]  Of course, as usual, the best coverage.
[03:50:59.774 --> 03:51:01.416]  Introducing Pro-1.
[03:51:01.676 --> 03:51:05.179]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[03:51:05.319 --> 03:51:09.723]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[03:51:09.863 --> 03:51:15.848]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[03:51:15.968 --> 03:51:26.757]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.
[03:51:26.957 --> 03:51:33.263]  It is the only one that does it, and out of the gate, we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[03:51:33.443 --> 03:51:48.176]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands,
[03:51:48.356 --> 03:51:51.319]  Since disaster can strike at any time, you always need to be prepared.
[03:51:51.339 --> 03:51:52.901]  And not just with an insurance policy.
[03:51:52.921 --> 03:51:55.644]  Superstorm Sandy left thousands of people starving and stranded for weeks.
[03:52:13.376 --> 03:52:14.177]  April 30th.
[03:52:14.377 --> 03:52:16.919]  Save up to 25% on freeze-dried food.
[03:52:17.019 --> 03:52:20.402]  During the Freeze-Dry Guy makes and match number 10 can sale.

[03:52:30.151 --> 03:52:31.612]  Over 25 years.
[03:52:31.912 --> 03:52:34.755]  Choose from entrees, meats, vegetables, fruits, and desserts.
[03:52:35.135 --> 03:52:36.456]  All made in the USA.
[03:52:36.696 --> 03:52:38.038]  Just add hot water, wait 10 minutes,
[03:52:38.818 --> 03:52:45.563]  Imagine waking one morning only to find your family shivering in the dark because you couldn't afford to pay your electric bill.
[03:52:45.583 --> 03:52:46.824]  That's closer than you think.
[03:53:08.129 --> 03:53:13.956]  You probably haven't heard about this yet because the liberal media has been suppressing what is fast becoming the most shocking news story of 2012.
[03:53:15.858 --> 03:53:21.164]  Obama's secret war on coal that could increase your already high power bill as much as 400% in coming months.
[03:53:23.050 --> 03:53:28.636]  As shocking as it sounds, it may well be just a matter of time before the lights start going out across America.
[03:53:29.337 --> 03:53:30.338]  But here's some good news.
[03:53:30.718 --> 03:53:39.527]  There's an underground video at exposed123.com that thousands of smart patriots have used to end their slavery to the corrupt electricity monopoly.
[03:53:40.194 --> 03:53:44.037]  The video at exposed123.com has already been banned by Google.
[03:53:44.478 --> 03:53:49.001]  And the liberal media is doing everything in its power to take it down and keep America in the dark.
[03:53:49.462 --> 03:53:53.505]  So watch it now at exposed123.com before it's too late.
[03:53:53.665 --> 03:53:55.146]  Again, that's exposed123.com.
[03:54:10.626 --> 03:54:12.907]  Alright, I'm going to say bye to Richard Belzer here in a moment.
[03:54:12.927 --> 03:54:14.527]  We're going to take more calls from Massachusetts.
[03:54:14.587 --> 03:54:15.868]  I'm going to go into fourth hour.
[03:54:16.328 --> 03:54:23.290]  Fifth hour, this is the end of the fourth hour, completely commercial free, audio and video streams at InfoWars.com.
[03:54:23.690 --> 03:54:28.772]  Have the IT folks put a free video stream up for everyone, like we did during the election.
[03:54:29.092 --> 03:54:33.653]  We can fire up ThePrisonPlanet.tv streams for everybody, get Curt Nemo to add it.
[03:54:33.973 --> 03:54:35.694]  I'm going to ask Sha'Carri Jackson and...
[03:54:37.154 --> 03:54:41.195]  And Rob Dew and crew to host the next three hours with David Knight.
[03:54:41.495 --> 03:54:44.736]  And then I will go live tonight when we know more at seven o'clock.
[03:54:44.756 --> 03:54:46.836]  We'll go to about five or so with live coverage.
[03:54:47.756 --> 03:54:50.997]  And then we can gear up to go live at seven o'clock.
[03:54:51.337 --> 03:54:53.818]  And I want that stream given to the web guys free to everybody.
[03:54:53.858 --> 03:54:54.858]  PresidentMilano.tv.
[03:54:55.318 --> 03:54:59.299]  We have to pay for the band with folks, but we have enough members and stuff to be able to do that.
[03:54:59.699 --> 03:55:02.040]  I mean, when we get like 300,000 people to tune in, I will get a $20,000 bill.
[03:55:03.200 --> 03:55:06.021]  Doesn't matter, I've got to be able to respond to these people.
[03:55:06.601 --> 03:55:10.762]  So be sure and buy books, buy videos, support us, buy the bumper stickers, just all of it.
[03:55:11.082 --> 03:55:12.322]  This is an all-out info war.
[03:55:12.642 --> 03:55:15.483]  And I think people are beginning to understand, the crew's completely freaked out.
[03:55:15.503 --> 03:55:20.283]  Because I walked in here the day before Sandy Hook and I said, something bad's about to happen.
[03:55:20.924 --> 03:55:23.404]  And today I said, I'm physically sick.
[03:55:23.544 --> 03:55:26.345]  They're getting ready to, I said on air, they're getting ready to blow stuff up.
[03:55:26.645 --> 03:55:27.025]  And I said,
[03:55:28.143 --> 03:55:36.905]  They're going to do their own shot heard around the world to blame it on us, so like Lexington and Concord, and this is the day it happened, at that place!
[03:55:38.945 --> 03:55:47.087]  I mean, my God, I mean, because listen, I said Bin Laden, they'll say Bin Laden blew up the World Trade Center, and they're going to blame it on him, and he'll take the blame.
[03:55:47.327 --> 03:55:48.547]  And I said that July 25th.
[03:55:48.567 --> 03:55:49.768]  I don't know how I know this stuff.
[03:55:49.828 --> 03:55:53.408]  It's like, you know, look, I need my own 1-800 number to start reading horoscopes or something.
[03:55:53.448 --> 03:55:54.849]  No, I mean, it's not that, folks.
[03:55:54.889 --> 03:55:55.689]  I get their script.
[03:55:56.149 --> 03:55:57.750]  And they may blame it on Muslims anyways.
[03:55:57.770 --> 03:55:59.191]  I don't know what they're going to do.
[03:55:59.472 --> 03:56:01.273]  But right now, it's Patriots Day.
[03:56:01.793 --> 03:56:03.234]  It's April 19th.
[03:56:03.515 --> 03:56:05.896]  Now if you don't pay your money to the Federal Reserve, you're a terrorist.
[03:56:06.157 --> 03:56:12.661]  And Rob Dew talks about his brother-in-law constantly, who he has arguments with, who works for, what is it, the Defense Intelligence Agency?
[03:56:13.582 --> 03:56:14.483]  He's in the army.
[03:56:14.563 --> 03:56:15.043]  Yeah, I know.
[03:56:15.063 --> 03:56:16.505]  People are going to get mad you're talking about this.
[03:56:16.545 --> 03:56:22.269]  The point is, I'm just going to hold Richard Belzer over a little bit, too, because I want to have a final comment, but I want to break this now.
[03:56:22.790 --> 03:56:33.359]  Rob Dew, news director, your wife's brother, tell people what happened to him today.
[03:56:33.439 --> 03:56:34.660]  He was in command.
[03:56:35.731 --> 03:56:37.251]  Well, I would not get to see it.
[03:56:37.271 --> 03:56:38.672]  Well, he was in command of the military there.
[03:56:39.492 --> 03:56:41.052]  Tell me what you told me out there.
[03:56:41.132 --> 03:56:43.533]  I'll tell you what, he was running the race today.
[03:56:43.793 --> 03:56:45.713]  Yeah, running the race.
[03:56:45.753 --> 03:56:46.153]  Running it.
[03:56:46.173 --> 03:56:46.853]  Oh, running it.
[03:56:46.993 --> 03:56:48.734]  I misunderstood because I saw Army there.
[03:56:48.874 --> 03:56:50.474]  He was running in the race.
[03:56:50.694 --> 03:56:51.474]  Okay, got it.
[03:56:51.554 --> 03:56:52.374]  And they had Army there.
[03:56:52.514 --> 03:56:55.055]  He went with Army in a bus.
[03:56:55.515 --> 03:56:56.515]  And they were running.
[03:56:57.035 --> 03:56:59.496]  Well, yeah, I guess I can see how you misconstrued it.
[03:56:59.516 --> 03:57:00.836]  You just told me this during the break.
[03:57:01.576 --> 03:57:06.097]  Because I knew he ran stuff, I knew he was in intelligence domestically, so I just got it wrong.
[03:57:06.137 --> 03:57:06.437]  Go ahead.
[03:57:06.637 --> 03:57:12.159]  So he was running the race, and at some point they pulled him from the race and said, you're dehydrated, you need to go to the hospital.
[03:57:12.959 --> 03:57:17.500]  And so they sent him to the hospital, and what my wife told me... Wasn't that nice of them?
[03:57:17.560 --> 03:57:20.541]  She was getting... Just like Mayor Willie Brown got the call not to fly!
[03:57:20.561 --> 03:57:22.421]  Oh my God!
[03:57:22.621 --> 03:57:29.703]  And his wife told my wife that he's in the hospital now, but he would have been crossing... Just center that camera.
[03:57:29.983 --> 03:57:33.145]  That those, um, that the bombs did go off.
[03:57:33.326 --> 03:57:33.786]  Start over.
[03:57:33.806 --> 03:57:37.849]  I misread what you said and then we're going to get Belzer's take.
[03:57:37.869 --> 03:57:39.891]  We're going to go to break, go commercial break, go back to Belzer.
[03:57:40.411 --> 03:57:41.512]  Start over because that was interrupting.
[03:57:42.878 --> 03:57:46.721]  Because right before you went live and I drug you in here, you go, oh my gosh, I just got off the phone with my wife.
[03:57:46.761 --> 03:57:49.403]  Her brother, he was running the race.
[03:57:49.743 --> 03:57:51.524]  He's in domestic military operations.
[03:57:51.764 --> 03:57:53.045]  He's the guy that I argue with all the time.
[03:57:53.405 --> 03:57:54.826]  And he was going to be right there.
[03:57:55.567 --> 03:57:56.788]  And they made him go to the hospital.
[03:57:56.888 --> 03:57:57.969]  I said, what, they drug him?
[03:57:58.309 --> 03:57:59.530]  Like, oh, he's in command.
[03:57:59.770 --> 03:58:00.670]  Now I get it.
[03:58:00.831 --> 03:58:02.131]  They're like, you need to go.
[03:58:02.151 --> 03:58:06.835]  That's like Mayor Willie Brown told not to fly on 9-11 the day before.
[03:58:08.876 --> 03:58:09.657]  Stay there, stay there.
[03:58:09.717 --> 03:58:11.218]  Richard Belzer, what's your take on that?
[03:58:11.778 --> 03:58:20.602]  Well, I'm rarely speechless, but the fact that they pulled him out means now we know it is a domestic operation.
[03:58:21.422 --> 03:58:24.243]  Oh my God, if he wasn't really sick, did he say he was sick?
[03:58:24.483 --> 03:58:25.203]  That's what I don't know.
[03:58:25.223 --> 03:58:25.964]  They're gonna tell him to shut up.
[03:58:25.984 --> 03:58:26.564]  Call him right now.
[03:58:26.584 --> 03:58:27.084]  That's what I don't know.
[03:58:27.104 --> 03:58:27.744]  Call him right now.
[03:58:27.764 --> 03:58:27.965]  Alright.
[03:58:28.105 --> 03:58:28.825]  Call him right now.
[03:58:28.845 --> 03:58:29.345]  Alright.
[03:58:29.385 --> 03:58:32.206]  Before, I shouldn't even have... This is breaking right now.
[03:58:32.386 --> 03:58:34.067]  I am living in... They're saving their own people.
[03:58:34.087 --> 03:58:34.647]  Lots of people.
[03:58:35.087 --> 03:58:36.688]  Yeah, they save their own people every time.
[03:58:36.788 --> 03:58:37.388]  Oh my God.
[03:58:38.129 --> 03:58:38.649]  Unbelievable.
[03:58:40.250 --> 03:58:42.050]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:58:43.511 --> 03:58:45.771]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:58:49.873 --> 03:58:51.073]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[03:58:51.273 --> 03:59:01.756]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[03:59:01.956 --> 03:59:06.037]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.
[03:59:06.417 --> 03:59:08.838]  But we can't do that without your help.
[03:59:09.158 --> 03:59:20.023]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at InfoWars.com, you will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[03:59:20.423 --> 03:59:23.605]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[03:59:23.925 --> 03:59:29.569]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[03:59:30.050 --> 03:59:39.577]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[03:59:39.958 --> 03:59:41.139]  The war is here.
[03:59:41.459 --> 03:59:42.860]  It's an info war.
[03:59:43.360 --> 03:59:45.882]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[03:59:52.560 --> 03:59:57.424]  You're listening to GZN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[04:00:00.106 --> 04:00:00.667]  We've got it.
[04:00:07.260 --> 04:00:11.321]  Waging war on corruption.
[04:00:11.641 --> 04:00:17.303]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[04:00:19.964 --> 04:00:24.445]  Okay folks, I'll be back later throughout the next few hours.
[04:00:24.765 --> 04:00:26.665]  I need to go reset, get my mind around this.
[04:00:30.393 --> 04:00:35.777]  And we're going to have Rob Dewan here and Jacari Jackson and sitting right in this seat, we'll let David Knight traffic cop things.
[04:00:36.237 --> 04:00:38.259]  I'll be on the Nightly News 7 o'clock Central.
[04:00:38.279 --> 04:00:46.445]  If you go to InfoWars.com forward slash listen, we already had this planned to be able to have the daytime show free to everybody in the future.
[04:00:46.465 --> 04:00:51.749]  We were going to get some sponsors for it and hopefully it'll work so we can like, you know, have subscription for the Nightly News.
[04:00:51.789 --> 04:00:54.051]  But my goal is just reach more people, not make money.
[04:00:54.331 --> 04:00:55.472]  It's not bad to want to make money.
[04:00:56.112 --> 04:00:57.713]  It's just that we want to reach people.
[04:00:57.754 --> 04:00:59.355]  We want to be able to challenge the official
[04:00:59.955 --> 04:01:00.395]  Narrative.
[04:01:01.376 --> 04:01:11.002]  Rob Dew is out there calling his brother-in-law, who I always get to hear about the arguments they have, you know, about the New World Order and stuff.
[04:01:11.682 --> 04:01:14.584]  And he was running the marathon, I guess, as part of the Army team.
[04:01:16.345 --> 04:01:16.906]  He's a runner.
[04:01:16.966 --> 04:01:17.986]  He's a cross-country runner.
[04:01:18.006 --> 04:01:19.427]  He was brought in on Army, and they pulled him out.
[04:01:19.447 --> 04:01:21.949]  Listen, you've got to get a hold of him now when he doesn't understand.
[04:01:21.989 --> 04:01:22.849]  This could be his moment.
[04:01:22.989 --> 04:01:23.249]  Yeah.
[04:01:23.269 --> 04:01:24.790]  Or they could also go after him.
[04:01:24.810 --> 04:01:25.311]  But the point is,
[04:01:25.951 --> 04:01:27.072]  Were you dehydrated?
[04:01:27.312 --> 04:01:28.632]  Why did they make him go to the hospital?
[04:01:28.772 --> 04:01:29.793]  That's the key question.
[04:01:30.073 --> 04:01:35.996]  And this is what my wife got from his wife, that he was running the race, they pulled him out and said, you're dehydrated, and they sent him to the hospital.
[04:01:37.397 --> 04:01:38.737]  Just out of the blue, how would they know that?
[04:01:39.097 --> 04:01:39.598]  Exactly.
[04:01:39.618 --> 04:01:41.579]  I mean, I see people run races all the time.
[04:01:43.271 --> 04:01:47.775]  They're peeing themselves because their bodies are breaking down because they're doing this right and they let people continue.
[04:01:47.835 --> 04:01:50.117]  So I don't know why he's in great physical shape.
[04:01:50.477 --> 04:01:50.797]  So I don't.
[04:01:51.458 --> 04:01:52.299]  He knows his body.
[04:01:52.519 --> 04:01:56.282]  You know, I've I've seen the guy run, you know, 20 miles.
[04:01:56.902 --> 04:01:57.383]  No problem.
[04:01:57.423 --> 04:01:58.884]  Come back and eat breakfast, you know.
[04:02:00.145 --> 04:02:01.106]  So it's very odd.
[04:02:01.626 --> 04:02:03.228]  And I'm your wife's brother.
[04:02:03.508 --> 04:02:03.768]  Yeah.
[04:02:04.189 --> 04:02:05.650]  That I always hear you arguing with.
[04:02:06.656 --> 04:02:06.956]  Yeah.
[04:02:06.996 --> 04:02:08.558]  You guys even text message back and forth.
[04:02:08.738 --> 04:02:09.278]  Yeah, yeah.
[04:02:09.298 --> 04:02:10.319]  I mean, that's not every day.
[04:02:10.359 --> 04:02:10.740]  Call him!
[04:02:10.820 --> 04:02:11.200]  Call him!
[04:02:11.981 --> 04:02:12.461]  Did he answer?
[04:02:12.481 --> 04:02:17.006]  No, the first time he didn't answer, so... I shouldn't have talked about it early, but you know what?
[04:02:17.106 --> 04:02:17.786]  I'm not perfect.
[04:02:18.187 --> 04:02:20.169]  Because I get excited.
[04:02:21.410 --> 04:02:21.710]  Alex?
[04:02:21.990 --> 04:02:24.272]  Yeah, Richard, I want you to have closing comments.
[04:02:24.292 --> 04:02:25.594]  What do you think of this happening right now?
[04:02:25.614 --> 04:02:29.817]  I think that this gentleman you're talking about, this could be an epiphany moment for him.
[04:02:31.125 --> 04:02:43.936]  Now understanding what you've been arguing about, if he was pulled out for no other reason, then he'll put it together that they were protecting him from the event, and then that may be his moment.
[04:02:44.497 --> 04:02:45.197]  You know what I mean?
[04:02:45.297 --> 04:02:53.044]  To wake up and say, whoa, I hope he's okay, and I hope they're not using him, and I hope that he stays safe.
[04:02:54.105 --> 04:02:57.626]  Well, let me pull up the San Francisco Chronicle here for people.
[04:02:58.727 --> 04:03:01.488]  Willie Brown got low-key warning about air travel.
[04:03:01.828 --> 04:03:03.168]  They actually changed that headline.
[04:03:03.188 --> 04:03:04.189]  That's September 12th.
[04:03:04.789 --> 04:03:07.710]  He was told not to fly and called by Condoleezza Rice.
[04:03:08.130 --> 04:03:08.990]  That later came out.
[04:03:09.070 --> 04:03:10.011]  Don't fly to New York.
[04:03:10.351 --> 04:03:13.312]  The Defense Department had a bunch of generals going to New York on September 11th.
[04:03:13.552 --> 04:03:14.992]  They canceled it September 10th.
[04:03:15.373 --> 04:03:16.553]  This just keeps happening.
[04:03:17.413 --> 04:03:19.114]  Because I guess they warn their buddies.
[04:03:19.734 --> 04:03:21.835]  And of course, they'll spin it and say, well, we had intel.
[04:03:23.446 --> 04:03:24.446]  Uh, he's not answering now?
[04:03:24.466 --> 04:03:24.507]  No.
[04:03:26.367 --> 04:03:30.069]  Well, for his safety... I don't even know if he has his phone, honestly.
[04:03:30.109 --> 04:03:32.349]  Yeah, because your wife called you and told you the story.
[04:03:32.570 --> 04:03:41.153]  Right, and he got it from his wife, and apparently all of his belongings were on the bus, and that's what, you know, they're trying to get that wherever that is, because he's at the hospital right now.
[04:03:41.173 --> 04:03:46.635]  Now, you know, obviously all pandemonium is breaking loose over there with, uh... Look at the Mayor Willie Brown article.
[04:03:46.655 --> 04:03:47.715]  Let's put that on screen, guys.
[04:03:48.175 --> 04:03:49.516]  When was that published, Alex?
[04:03:50.376 --> 04:03:51.096]  Uh, that was September 12, 2001.
[04:03:53.715 --> 04:03:55.456]  Well, he had a vague warning.
[04:03:56.016 --> 04:03:57.037]  Well, they changed the headline.
[04:03:57.077 --> 04:04:02.960]  Later it was, Willie Brown told not to fly on evening of September 10th, I think was the original.
[04:04:03.180 --> 04:04:07.362]  We did a whole report showing the Wayback Machine, and then later they changed this.
[04:04:07.702 --> 04:04:11.504]  But no, he was, and then later it came out, Condoleezza Rice told him don't fly.
[04:04:11.764 --> 04:04:14.685]  Yeah, in fact, at the time, he didn't pay much mind to it.
[04:04:14.985 --> 04:04:16.826]  And, you know, oh, and then I got a call.
[04:04:16.846 --> 04:04:21.769]  Well, if I was going somewhere, and I'd say, well, you know, you're not paying much mind, then why didn't you fly to New York, buddy?
[04:04:23.444 --> 04:04:25.965]  Yeah, exactly.
[04:04:25.985 --> 04:04:38.111]  You know, on September, I think it was 10th or 9th, Rumsfeld had a press conference and said, there's $2.3 trillion missing from the Pentagon.
[04:04:38.171 --> 04:04:38.652]  That's right.
[04:04:39.332 --> 04:04:45.195]  And then he walked off, and then one of the planes hit the section of the Pentagon where the records are kept.
[04:04:46.345 --> 04:04:49.907]  And then see, that way they could just get the story out, then kill it with the next big story.
[04:04:50.467 --> 04:04:50.907]  That's right.
[04:04:51.367 --> 04:04:55.549]  Man, I tell you, see, working in the media, you learn how this stuff works, and you watch them.
[04:04:55.589 --> 04:04:56.690]  It's not like I'm even that smart.
[04:04:57.170 --> 04:05:00.251]  I'm engrossed in this 18 hours a day.
[04:05:00.331 --> 04:05:02.552]  So are you, Belzer, probably before I was even born.
[04:05:02.912 --> 04:05:04.813]  You've been talking about this stuff since I was a kid.
[04:05:06.814 --> 04:05:08.655]  But it's not fun to be famous fighting this.
[04:05:08.675 --> 04:05:09.535]  I hope people understand.
[04:05:09.855 --> 04:05:13.477]  It's like we're flying the trench in the Death Star, you know.
[04:05:13.577 --> 04:05:14.798]  This is going to be another setback.
[04:05:15.998 --> 04:05:17.640]  In the long fight.
[04:05:17.920 --> 04:05:20.162]  This could be the launch of them blowing crap up everywhere.
[04:05:20.962 --> 04:05:24.545]  They're teaching the state police, prepare to arrest the right-wing Christians.
[04:05:24.885 --> 04:05:27.608]  Who aren't really right-wingers, they're patriots who know what's going on.
[04:05:28.328 --> 04:05:31.871]  And they've got the left brainwashed about, you know, let's arrest all the gun owners.
[04:05:31.891 --> 04:05:32.912]  You know what?
[04:05:32.932 --> 04:05:39.317]  They're going to have, in these groups, they'll have government people pretending that they're in the group.
[04:05:39.921 --> 04:05:51.105]  And, you know, commit an act, and then it'll be blamed on the group, and if it goes to trial, they have a closed session, national security, you can't indict this person, and yet the event occurred.
[04:05:51.806 --> 04:05:52.886]  Yeah, absolutely.
[04:05:52.906 --> 04:05:57.288]  Richard, we're going to have to talk to you very soon in the aftermath of this, because you were part of this happening today.
[04:05:57.328 --> 04:06:03.130]  We'll stay in touch, stand by in the next, probably tomorrow even, get you to pop in for 20 minutes if you can do it or not.
[04:06:03.450 --> 04:06:04.391]  I'd love to, yes, I can.
[04:06:05.211 --> 04:06:06.052]  Whenever you need, Alex.
[04:06:06.132 --> 04:06:07.132]  And stay safe, buddy.
[04:06:35.291 --> 04:06:35.852]  Take care, Alex.
[04:06:35.892 --> 04:06:36.292]  Thank you.
[04:06:37.092 --> 04:06:45.219]  Ladies and gentlemen, the meter's running when I put up a free link, everybody, because we've had over 300,000 people tune in in a day.
[04:06:45.239 --> 04:06:52.224]  It was like 350 or something, I forget, in a day and a half to the election coverage, and it was a $20,000 bill, and that's cheap bandwidth.
[04:06:52.824 --> 04:06:53.185]  Okay?
[04:06:54.205 --> 04:06:55.186]  At least as cheap as we can get.
[04:07:01.067 --> 04:07:09.883]  You know, we had three and a half million people watch the great reports by Aaron Dykes and Paul Watson from Bilderberg two years ago.
[04:07:12.312 --> 04:07:13.313]  I mean, that's just an example.
[04:07:13.353 --> 04:07:14.794]  So everybody's tuning in.
[04:07:15.155 --> 04:07:17.517]  Go to Twitter.com forward slash RealAlexJones.
[04:07:18.018 --> 04:07:26.566]  We have the feeds right there for everybody so that you can go to InfoWars.com forward slash listen.
[04:07:27.006 --> 04:07:31.270]  Or again, we're going to send that link out to everybody.
[04:07:33.152 --> 04:07:34.093]  Two dead, 22 wounded.
[04:07:34.113 --> 04:07:36.235]  So it was three dead, a dozen wounded.
[04:07:37.594 --> 04:07:38.234]  Now it's two dead.
[04:07:38.274 --> 04:07:38.814]  That's good news.
[04:07:38.875 --> 04:07:39.615]  It's only two dead.
[04:07:39.635 --> 04:07:41.335]  But I mean, one man dies.
[04:07:41.355 --> 04:07:42.216]  This is tragedy.
[04:07:42.236 --> 04:07:42.776]  10,000 deaths.
[04:07:42.876 --> 04:07:43.596]  It's a statistic.
[04:07:44.056 --> 04:07:44.857]  Joseph Stalin.
[04:07:45.237 --> 04:07:53.100]  And that's why I've been telling everybody in my spirit, in my soul, I said to myself, you know, people are like, well, why are you having Mark Dice on?
[04:07:53.600 --> 04:07:56.021]  You know, when he came out and said all that stuff about you and all that.
[04:07:56.041 --> 04:07:57.962]  Well, I mean, you know, Mark, I talked to Mark.
[04:07:58.786 --> 04:07:59.667]  You know, I said, let me guess.
[04:07:59.687 --> 04:08:00.928]  You had a lot of personal stuff happen.
[04:08:00.949 --> 04:08:02.350]  You had a lot of setbacks and stuff.
[04:08:02.791 --> 04:08:03.832]  He goes, yeah, how do you know that?
[04:08:03.852 --> 04:08:05.253]  I'm not going to get all into the personal stuff.
[04:08:05.574 --> 04:08:11.040]  And I said, listen, it's normal when people go through things to get mad at somebody that's actually helped them and put them on the radar.
[04:08:11.360 --> 04:08:13.142]  But I said, you're a talented guy on your own.
[04:08:14.181 --> 04:08:19.325]  And I said, that's why I'm promoting you, and that's why he's been the top of Drudge since Friday, because Drudge understands it's an important video.
[04:08:19.545 --> 04:08:23.348]  With these authoritarians saying, let's go arrest all the gun owners, let's go door to door.
[04:08:23.608 --> 04:08:25.470]  I go, Mark, you are a smart guy.
[04:08:26.110 --> 04:08:32.635]  And that's why we need, I mean, listen, folks, we're not going to be on the air forever if we don't back these people off.
[04:08:33.536 --> 04:08:35.517]  They're committed to their plan to take our guns.
[04:08:35.757 --> 04:08:37.399]  They're committed to take your bank accounts.
[04:08:37.679 --> 04:08:38.279]  They're committed.
[04:08:38.319 --> 04:08:39.060]  We've got to have
[04:08:40.339 --> 04:08:45.702]  That's why Glenn Beck said a lot of nasty stuff about me, done stuff behind the scenes trying to hold me back and stuff because he's worldly and wrong.
[04:08:46.122 --> 04:08:49.324]  But I think overall he's probably not really a bad guy.
[04:08:49.364 --> 04:08:50.484]  I want to give him the benefit of the doubt.
[04:08:50.985 --> 04:08:54.466]  And I've said before I'm going to bury the hatchet if he won't attack me anymore then he always attacks me again.
[04:08:55.127 --> 04:08:57.008]  But I'm going to say this before God and my children.
[04:08:57.708 --> 04:09:05.930]  You're not, if I ever attack him back or just set the record straight, I'm gonna do it not even doing that evil laugh I do, because that's an evil thing I do.
[04:09:06.151 --> 04:09:08.911]  I'm a really sweet person, dude, you've been around me for years, you know I'm a real guy?
[04:09:09.091 --> 04:09:09.972]  Yeah, totally real.
[04:09:10.432 --> 04:09:12.953]  You're the best boss, I've told many people this, you're the best boss I've ever worked for.
[04:09:12.973 --> 04:09:17.114]  But what I've noticed out in the world is when you are super nice, a lot of people, it like flips them out.
[04:09:18.014 --> 04:09:27.520]  I just don't understand it, but my whole point is, is that that's why... I mean, who cares if Glenn Beck says bad things about me just because he's jealous of competition?
[04:09:27.540 --> 04:09:29.441]  You know, Alex Jones, you piece of garbage.
[04:09:29.641 --> 04:09:30.542]  Get him off, come on.
[04:09:30.602 --> 04:09:33.403]  I don't know what you're... But the point is, is it's none of it's going to matter.
[04:09:33.844 --> 04:09:35.184]  And I'll tell you where it is.
[04:09:35.244 --> 04:09:41.028]  Last week, I kind of out of the blue said, if this was my last broadcast and a few things I wanted to say, and it wasn't even thought out, it wasn't very powerful.
[04:09:42.025 --> 04:09:49.075]  And I think when I come back tonight at 7, I'm going to really write down the notes and say, if this was my last broadcast, because... I tell you what, that's come back to me already.
[04:09:49.215 --> 04:09:52.059]  Several people have sent that back to me, saying, this is amazing from Alex Jones.
[04:09:52.099 --> 04:09:53.522]  And you just did that off the cuff.
[04:09:53.562 --> 04:09:56.566]  That wasn't even... Well, I said, I said, I feel like it's all about to happen.
[04:09:56.586 --> 04:09:58.048]  I don't know how long we're going to be on the air.
[04:09:59.694 --> 04:10:00.815]  And I was there when you shot that.
[04:10:00.855 --> 04:10:04.998]  You were like, I gotta say one more thing, I wanna come back, I wanna say one more thing, and you just, you went off.
[04:10:05.559 --> 04:10:06.299]  And I thought it was great.
[04:10:06.319 --> 04:10:08.341]  People were sending that back to me, and they're like, this is amazing.
[04:10:08.381 --> 04:10:09.742]  When did Alex record this?
[04:10:10.042 --> 04:10:11.043]  And, you know, it was just awesome.
[04:10:11.063 --> 04:10:12.224]  Well, I'm telling you what's happening.
[04:10:12.464 --> 04:10:17.448]  We've asked God for providence, and we're gonna go to break and come back with the other host to come in here and take over for me.
[04:10:18.129 --> 04:10:19.610]  We've, I've asked for providence.
[04:10:19.670 --> 04:10:20.471]  I've really prayed.
[04:10:20.511 --> 04:10:21.852]  But you gotta be careful what you pray for.
[04:10:21.952 --> 04:10:27.316]  When you really, you know, when God knows your heart and knows that, you know, I mean, I've prayed for things and it happens.
[04:10:28.539 --> 04:10:34.783]  And I watched my five-year-old daughter go out to leave with my mother to go to a dance class, and she was so innocent.
[04:10:34.823 --> 04:10:35.844]  My mother was so innocent.
[04:10:35.864 --> 04:10:36.824]  I said, this is the start of the show.
[04:10:37.245 --> 04:10:38.906]  I said, the whole hammer's about to come down.
[04:10:39.406 --> 04:10:43.769]  All this bad stuff's about to happen, and I just feel guilty that I couldn't do enough for my children.
[04:10:44.709 --> 04:10:48.972]  And I just feel bad for the people out there that don't know we're real, don't know how real all this is.
[04:10:49.733 --> 04:10:53.635]  But when you put yourself on the line, God gives you providence, and real providence.
[04:10:55.779 --> 04:11:00.764]  When you commit, and God knows you're going to go all the way, that's when the doors open up.
[04:11:00.904 --> 04:11:06.709]  And I'm not saying it's a fun thing either, but it's what... And God gives you intelligence.
[04:11:07.170 --> 04:11:10.493]  That's what... See, the New World Order has their Google and their spy systems.
[04:11:10.933 --> 04:11:12.254]  We've got Providence.
[04:11:12.315 --> 04:11:13.315]  We've got God.
[04:11:14.236 --> 04:11:17.979]  Literally, as Martin Luther King says, the universe bends towards justice.
[04:11:18.500 --> 04:11:21.242]  We have that type of intel.
[04:11:21.282 --> 04:11:29.788]  They have human, they have digital information, they have their electronic spying, but still they have their evil brains.
[04:11:31.149 --> 04:11:32.849]  And they're getting their devil intelligence.
[04:11:32.889 --> 04:11:34.250]  The devil's empowering them.
[04:11:35.090 --> 04:11:37.350]  And everybody can feel it.
[04:11:37.510 --> 04:11:38.571]  Everybody can see it.
[04:11:38.711 --> 04:11:39.571]  Everybody can know it.
[04:11:39.591 --> 04:11:41.691]  I don't know if they're going to blame this on Muslims.
[04:11:41.711 --> 04:11:42.731]  There's a slight chance of that.
[04:11:43.091 --> 04:11:43.852]  It's Patriots Day.
[04:11:43.892 --> 04:11:44.392]  It's Boston.
[04:11:44.432 --> 04:11:45.592]  It's going to be blamed on the Tea Party.
[04:11:46.252 --> 04:11:47.092]  I mean, probably.
[04:11:47.392 --> 04:11:48.513]  Ninety percent, I'd say, right now.
[04:11:48.553 --> 04:11:52.493]  Unless they decide... They're due engaging right now to see how the public's going to respond.
[04:11:53.053 --> 04:11:55.414]  They've got computer algorithms, wargaming, all this.
[04:11:56.909 --> 04:12:05.017]  But, dude, I tell you, it's providence that your brother-in-law, who's in military intelligence, was running the race for the Army and got pulled out.
[04:12:05.037 --> 04:12:06.559]  And we need to find out, was he really?
[04:12:06.579 --> 04:12:08.120]  Was he dehydrated?
[04:12:08.140 --> 04:12:10.363]  Well, I'm sure they're really going to say, well, I'm sure they saw signs.
[04:12:10.623 --> 04:12:13.486]  If he felt good and was going, then something's going on, man.
[04:12:13.982 --> 04:12:16.964]  My gut is, you know, the guy's in shape.
[04:12:17.145 --> 04:12:18.025]  The guy's in great shape.
[04:12:18.245 --> 04:12:21.108]  You guys go visit him and stuff and he says we run 20 miles for breakfast.
[04:12:21.148 --> 04:12:23.209]  Yeah, I mean, he's a runner.
[04:12:23.249 --> 04:12:24.250]  He's in shape.
[04:12:24.490 --> 04:12:25.371]  He knows what he's doing.
[04:12:25.691 --> 04:12:30.155]  And I've seen people crawl across that finish line.
[04:12:30.195 --> 04:12:31.276]  So why would they pull him out?
[04:12:33.450 --> 04:12:33.750]  I don't know.
[04:12:34.270 --> 04:12:41.752]  Matt, I tell you, and again, I'm waxing philosophical here, in almost an early nostalgia, before the events have even happened.
[04:12:42.772 --> 04:12:46.413]  I have nostalgia, because I can look into the future, historically, where we're going.
[04:12:46.533 --> 04:12:48.233]  I have nostalgia for the present.
[04:12:49.013 --> 04:12:57.695]  I have nostalgia for what's coming, because let me tell you, they set off a couple dozen bombs around America, and let me tell you, the martial law, it's 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[04:12:59.015 --> 04:13:01.676]  They have got it all set up, they're totally ready,
[04:13:02.873 --> 04:13:04.134]  It's all going on.
[04:13:04.194 --> 04:13:07.195]  You can see the preparation that's designed for dumbed-down public.
[04:13:07.335 --> 04:13:11.877]  Those of us that are aware, it's like, they're teaching the state police it's time to arrest all the Christians?
[04:13:12.578 --> 04:13:14.018]  There's going to be a war with Christians?
[04:13:14.038 --> 04:13:18.560]  I mean, what, is Obama going to put a pentagram on his hat and like, you know, say, Beelzebub, get them?
[04:13:20.041 --> 04:13:21.002]  Did you hear me in the first hour?
[04:13:21.062 --> 04:13:21.342]  I said,
[04:13:22.219 --> 04:13:24.901]  Hey, are you supposed to be having that meeting with the studio crew that's in there building the studio?
[04:13:25.382 --> 04:13:25.822]  I already did.
[04:13:26.102 --> 04:13:26.423]  We're done.
[04:13:27.143 --> 04:13:28.184]  We didn't cut that short, did we?
[04:13:28.224 --> 04:13:28.745]  No, no.
[04:13:28.985 --> 04:13:38.893]  I mean, I knew, I had already known the breaking news was happening and we were recording it on our end and, uh... Uh... Uh... I'd always have, you know, figures it would be... No, no, I don't even care about the studio.
[04:13:39.354 --> 04:13:40.074]  I should get off here.
[04:13:40.135 --> 04:13:43.217]  I'm gonna, I'm gonna go lay down and just reset for about 30 minutes.
[04:13:43.477 --> 04:13:43.618]  Yeah.
[04:13:47.935 --> 04:13:49.696]  I tell you what, it's really disconcerting.
[04:13:49.916 --> 04:13:50.736]  It's disconcerting.
[04:13:50.776 --> 04:13:55.938]  I'm just sitting here going, you know, you selfish, you know, bastard.
[04:13:55.978 --> 04:13:57.379]  You want to act like a tough guy.
[04:13:57.419 --> 04:13:59.499]  And then my discernment says, no, you're doing the right thing.
[04:13:59.720 --> 04:14:00.460]  Put everything on the line.
[04:14:00.480 --> 04:14:01.180]  That's what God likes.
[04:14:01.540 --> 04:14:04.461]  But my son's out there today and I'm thinking about getting my family out of the country.
[04:14:04.681 --> 04:14:05.062]  But you know what?
[04:14:05.202 --> 04:14:06.542]  Running is what has done this.
[04:14:06.862 --> 04:14:08.583]  We've got to stand against these people, Rob.
[04:14:08.963 --> 04:14:09.284]  I agree.
[04:14:09.464 --> 04:14:10.365]  Your family's on the line.
[04:14:10.605 --> 04:14:13.568]  Oh yeah, and that's the only thing that's going to take it is standing up to these people.
[04:14:13.968 --> 04:14:19.573]  You told the story on Sunday, you know, of the little minder who wants to come out and tell you how to raise your kids.
[04:14:19.594 --> 04:14:25.179]  You said suddenly in your neighborhood all these women are coming over attacking you because they hate seeing a father with his kids in the front yard.
[04:14:25.419 --> 04:14:26.540]  They've got to dominate you.
[04:14:26.700 --> 04:14:30.164]  MSNBC is saying you're the mommy now, not that man.
[04:14:30.364 --> 04:14:31.305]  Right, yeah.
[04:14:31.325 --> 04:14:32.026]  Tell people what happened.
[04:14:33.313 --> 04:14:39.757]  You tried to go to McKinney Falls and they said don't let your kids swim in a creek when there's no law against it.
[04:14:39.777 --> 04:14:41.658]  The guy came over and minded you and then followed you around.
[04:14:42.219 --> 04:14:43.479]  These people are a cult.
[04:14:43.680 --> 04:14:45.521]  They're like energized by a demonic spirit.
[04:14:45.781 --> 04:14:47.162]  I'm telling you, I've watched this long enough.
[04:14:47.262 --> 04:14:47.902]  It is a spirit.
[04:14:48.262 --> 04:14:50.163]  It's like host or something.
[04:14:50.184 --> 04:14:54.186]  It's like what David Icke says, like some weird galactic amoeba is attached to their brain stem.
[04:14:54.406 --> 04:14:59.750]  Yeah, and they do it with a smile, and they're all concerned, and they're worried about your kids, and what are you doing?
[04:15:00.090 --> 04:15:01.511]  How could you let your kids out like this?
[04:15:01.671 --> 04:15:06.675]  So, my kids were out in the front yard, and they decided to take off with two other kids down the street.
[04:15:06.735 --> 04:15:09.217]  Well, my three-year-old, I don't let him leave the front yard.
[04:15:09.597 --> 04:15:14.302]  You know, just because he doesn't know, looking left and right, doesn't cross, you know, doesn't cross streets, not thinking about that.
[04:15:14.342 --> 04:15:16.084]  So anyway, I went down to get them.
[04:15:16.564 --> 04:15:19.868]  They'd probably been gone four or five minutes, just right down the street.
[04:15:20.769 --> 04:15:23.772]  And this, this older lady comes, she's pulling their groceries.
[04:15:23.792 --> 04:15:25.454]  She goes, are those your kids?
[04:15:26.195 --> 04:15:27.476]  I said, well, I don't, did you see them?
[04:15:27.496 --> 04:15:28.197]  Which way did they go?
[04:15:28.677 --> 04:15:29.958]  And then I saw him right after that.
[04:15:29.999 --> 04:15:32.081]  And she goes, she goes, those kids.
[04:15:33.544 --> 04:15:34.305]  Keep going, I'll read this.
[04:15:34.325 --> 04:15:36.907]  She said, uh, those kids were running all over in the street.
[04:15:36.947 --> 04:15:37.588]  I said, which ones?
[04:15:37.608 --> 04:15:38.669]  She goes, well, two of them over there.
[04:15:38.689 --> 04:15:39.810]  I said, well, were they my kids?
[04:15:39.870 --> 04:15:42.833]  She goes, I don't know, but you're not a good father letting your kids run around like that.
[04:15:42.853 --> 04:15:44.074]  Probably called CPS on you.
[04:15:44.114 --> 04:15:44.654]  Wait a minute.
[04:15:44.734 --> 04:15:46.176]  And so I let it, I led into her.
[04:15:46.216 --> 04:15:47.757]  I said, listen, you mind your own business.
[04:15:48.097 --> 04:15:52.722]  You are not in response, because since she's responsible for these kids out here, I said, you're not responsible for my kids.
[04:15:52.742 --> 04:15:53.582]  Don't you ever say that.
[04:15:53.823 --> 04:15:55.304]  You're never going to be responsible for my kids.
[04:15:55.324 --> 04:15:56.305]  You go back in your house and you
[04:15:56.525 --> 04:15:57.246]  But she didn't care.
[04:15:57.266 --> 04:15:58.206]  It was about one-upping you.
[04:15:58.246 --> 04:16:01.008]  If she cared about the kids, she'd have gone down there and said, oh, let me help you.
[04:16:01.048 --> 04:16:02.048]  Oh, kids, get away from you.
[04:16:02.268 --> 04:16:02.969]  Now let's expand.
[04:16:02.989 --> 04:16:04.069]  Then you had another one come up.
[04:16:04.329 --> 04:16:05.250]  Oh, yeah.
[04:16:05.270 --> 04:16:09.232]  There's a little retaining pond around our thing where they got ducks and they make it all nice.
[04:16:09.252 --> 04:16:12.114]  So my kids want to go down, hang out, look at the ducks and look at tadpoles and stuff.
[04:16:12.134 --> 04:16:12.534]  Sounds evil.
[04:16:12.654 --> 04:16:12.914]  I know.
[04:16:13.234 --> 04:16:14.895]  And then they wanted to run around the pond.
[04:16:14.955 --> 04:16:16.196]  They wanted to do a lap around the pond.
[04:16:16.356 --> 04:16:16.696]  Sure.
[04:16:16.716 --> 04:16:17.717]  Go knock yourself out.
[04:16:17.777 --> 04:16:18.457]  Waste some energy.
[04:16:18.497 --> 04:16:18.977]  That's great.
[04:16:19.057 --> 04:16:19.678]  It just rained.
[04:16:19.718 --> 04:16:20.478]  Is it all nice?
[04:16:20.538 --> 04:16:21.579]  As they're running around...
[04:16:22.159 --> 04:16:25.882]  From the porch, this lady who's got an earth flag on the porch.
[04:16:25.922 --> 04:16:27.644]  Which means kill everybody flag.
[04:16:27.664 --> 04:16:28.124]  Exactly.
[04:16:29.265 --> 04:16:35.630]  Who I found out is bitched about the vines growing on the fence, so she wants them torn down so she can see the wildlife.
[04:16:35.710 --> 04:16:37.712]  Anyway, she goes, there's snakes over there.
[04:16:37.732 --> 04:16:38.853]  I said, what?
[04:16:38.993 --> 04:16:39.433]  Excuse me?
[04:16:39.973 --> 04:16:41.515]  She goes, there's probably snakes in there.
[04:16:41.595 --> 04:16:42.455]  I said, that's okay.
[04:16:42.495 --> 04:16:43.977]  My kids know what to do if they see a snake.
[04:16:44.497 --> 04:16:44.757]  You know?
[04:16:44.777 --> 04:16:47.059]  And I'm walking down the road.
[04:16:47.079 --> 04:16:50.102]  I should have said, you know, it's a lot more dangerous to drive your car down the street.
[04:16:50.122 --> 04:16:51.583]  You be careful when you're driving, okay?
[04:16:52.423 --> 04:16:54.986]  No, no, it's all about their authority.
[04:16:55.666 --> 04:16:57.107]  Now listen, let me give you the breaking news.
[04:16:57.708 --> 04:17:05.855]  Breaking, small homicide, a small homemade bomb is primary cause of explosion at Boston Marathon, law enforcement officials tell NBC.
[04:17:06.335 --> 04:17:18.426]  See, right where Lexington and Concord all started today, 200 and something years ago, they are not about, we're about to go to break and bring in the other host, they are not about to let anybody
[04:17:20.037 --> 04:17:21.257]  That's what I said at the start of the show.
[04:17:21.297 --> 04:17:24.298]  I said, they're going to fire the first shot for us and say we did it.
[04:17:24.758 --> 04:17:26.598]  I mean, that's 1-on-1 in a PSYOP.
[04:17:27.258 --> 04:17:29.079]  If the Redcoats would have done that, they would have won.
[04:17:29.399 --> 04:17:37.680]  If the Redcoats would have committed massacres and said that the Americans did it, the colonists did it, they would have won the war.
[04:17:38.500 --> 04:17:39.880]  Well, they've learned since then what to do.
[04:17:40.580 --> 04:17:41.981]  And they actually did do some false flags.
[04:17:42.001 --> 04:17:43.301]  They would actually do a few massacres.
[04:17:43.341 --> 04:17:44.961]  But that has to be a loan ship, though.
[04:17:45.321 --> 04:17:46.561]  And then have a fake account.
[04:17:47.982 --> 04:17:49.202]  They used to only do that on the high seas.
[04:17:50.964 --> 04:17:52.405]  They're reporting three bombs now.
[04:17:52.425 --> 04:17:55.608]  DrudgeReport.com has excellent coverage.
[04:17:55.628 --> 04:17:57.530]  So does PrisonBlooded.com and Infowars.com.
[04:17:58.311 --> 04:18:00.753]  Folks, follow us at RealAlexJones on Twitter.
[04:18:02.014 --> 04:18:05.958]  And we have the free video feed up there going out to everybody.
[04:18:05.978 --> 04:18:10.642]  For the next hour and 40 minutes or so, Jakari Jackson, David Knight are going to be in here.
[04:18:11.123 --> 04:18:12.424]  Also, you should be going and getting news.
[04:18:12.444 --> 04:18:13.645]  You can be coming in and getting stuff.
[04:18:14.065 --> 04:18:16.768]  I'll just cover whatever the latest is when I go on at 7 o'clock tonight.
[04:18:17.548 --> 04:18:19.670]  We'll air all the packages they've already done.
[04:18:20.030 --> 04:18:22.152]  We're going to air a package right here.
[04:18:22.172 --> 04:18:32.880]  We're going to air a package right here, a news package, done where the crew went out and showed the ammo shortages and stuff, and some areas in Texas are saying they're giving them to police first.
[04:18:33.701 --> 04:18:34.681]  So, confirming that.
[04:18:34.702 --> 04:18:35.582]  This is an important report.
[04:18:35.602 --> 04:18:36.783]  It's about three and a half minutes long.
[04:18:37.163 --> 04:18:42.988]  And then it'll be David Knight sitting right here in my seat and Jakari Jackson, or vice versa, I don't care, whoever wants to.
[04:18:43.248 --> 04:18:48.572]  I think they have Acevedo on camera saying, Art Acevedo, who's our chief of police, saying he doesn't have a problem getting ammo.
[04:18:49.393 --> 04:18:50.133]  He doesn't have a problem.
[04:18:50.533 --> 04:18:54.917]  Oh, well, Art Acevedo is going to be more than happy to be in here Friday after he went on a special visit to the White House.
[04:18:55.417 --> 04:19:00.801]  I'm sure he can talk to me about how bad, you know, the American people are for whatever just happened in Boston.
[04:19:00.841 --> 04:19:02.182]  It's all so convenient, isn't it?
[04:19:02.362 --> 04:19:04.143]  Yeah.
[04:19:04.163 --> 04:19:06.865]  Ah, man, I tell you, I tell you, this is completely sick.
[04:19:10.543 --> 04:19:15.767]  You notice that they're now saying it was another prosecutor that reportedly is killing these cops and prosecutors in Texas?
[04:19:16.168 --> 04:19:17.229]  Yeah, they said it was their own guy.
[04:19:17.289 --> 04:19:18.790]  And now it's the back of the paper, though.
[04:19:18.870 --> 04:19:25.536]  If it was a patriot, it would be, you know, blowing trumpets, let me tell you, you know, it's a patriot.
[04:19:26.479 --> 04:19:28.040]  Well, and they thought it was a white Aryan group.
[04:19:28.060 --> 04:19:29.521]  That's all they were touting.
[04:19:29.561 --> 04:19:31.563]  Yeah, and I said it's that or a Mexican Mafia group.
[04:19:31.903 --> 04:19:32.083]  Yeah.
[04:19:32.103 --> 04:19:33.765]  Because the Mexican Mafia kills even more cops.
[04:19:33.985 --> 04:19:35.426]  Because I've studied the criminology.
[04:19:35.466 --> 04:19:37.027]  Anybody who studied it knows that.
[04:19:37.067 --> 04:19:38.088]  A disgruntled minder.
[04:19:38.348 --> 04:19:40.490]  Now, just to recap without me hyperventilating.
[04:19:40.890 --> 04:19:44.773]  Your brother-in-law, running the marathon for the Army, brought in on an Army truck.
[04:19:45.133 --> 04:19:47.295]  They pull him out and say, you're going to the hospital.
[04:19:47.455 --> 04:19:48.035]  You're dehydrated.
[04:19:48.055 --> 04:19:48.555]  You need to go.
[04:19:48.715 --> 04:19:49.455]  That's what you were told?
[04:19:49.575 --> 04:19:49.775]  Right.
[04:19:49.975 --> 04:19:50.656]  That's what I was told.
[04:19:50.956 --> 04:19:54.436]  And when I say running, physically running in the marathon as a racer.
[04:19:54.496 --> 04:19:55.196]  I misunderstood.
[04:19:55.597 --> 04:19:57.197]  As a racer, he was running the marathon.
[04:19:57.237 --> 04:19:57.937]  They pulled him out.
[04:19:58.757 --> 04:19:59.877]  Said he was dehydrated.
[04:20:00.017 --> 04:20:01.038]  Sent him to the hospital.
[04:20:01.918 --> 04:20:02.938]  Then the bombs go off.
[04:20:03.558 --> 04:20:04.678]  It's now 28 hertz.
[04:20:04.698 --> 04:20:05.018]  Look at that.
[04:20:05.058 --> 04:20:05.919]  Look at that all burnt out.
[04:20:06.299 --> 04:20:08.939]  It just showed the building all burnt out and black.
[04:20:09.079 --> 04:20:09.719]  Oh my gosh.
[04:20:10.199 --> 04:20:12.040]  It'll be America's domestic 9-11.
[04:20:13.820 --> 04:20:16.061]  Yes, it was Patriots Day, April 15, 2013.
[04:20:17.382 --> 04:20:23.505]  The right-wing extremists struck a blow against what they believed was the New World Order and the takeover.
[04:20:23.805 --> 04:20:32.609]  They did it in symbolic Boston, Massachusetts, where hundreds of years earlier the colonists had fought against brave British troops fighting for the crown.
[04:20:34.007 --> 04:20:35.469]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[04:20:35.509 --> 04:20:36.951]  The editorial writes itself at that point.
[04:20:37.011 --> 04:20:38.994]  Oh my gosh, it's like, yes.
[04:20:39.495 --> 04:20:41.698]  I mean, they're all lined up saying, get ready!
[04:20:41.718 --> 04:20:45.944]  The Tea Party people that don't want a world government are going to blow stuff up!
[04:20:46.104 --> 04:20:46.425]  Boom!
[04:20:46.745 --> 04:20:47.466]  See, they did it!
[04:20:48.957 --> 04:20:54.118]  Thank God we have all these fusion centers and all these cops and riot gear and these tanks and, you know, troops ready to go.
[04:20:54.438 --> 04:20:57.279]  Thank God we've had this all planned out for years and years.
[04:20:57.359 --> 04:20:59.519]  And would you know, right on time it happened!
[04:20:59.679 --> 04:20:59.899]  Yeah.
[04:20:59.999 --> 04:21:01.539]  Right as our approval rating is plunging.
[04:21:01.739 --> 04:21:11.661]  And remember, they kept telling Obama, the only way you're going to get your agenda in public news articles, Shapiro and others, is Oklahoma City's domestically... Yeah, and there it is.
[04:21:12.341 --> 04:21:14.542]  Oh, but Obama, you know he'll go to the funerals and...
[04:21:15.848 --> 04:21:17.269]  America came together today.
[04:21:17.289 --> 04:21:21.714]  I can't really do a good Obama imitation.
[04:21:21.734 --> 04:21:22.835]  It's just so sick.
[04:21:22.895 --> 04:21:23.636]  It's so scripted.
[04:21:23.656 --> 04:21:26.438]  And they'll be like, yeah, Alex Jones, you're the one that called for 1776.
[04:21:27.039 --> 04:21:28.640]  And look what happened!
[04:21:29.321 --> 04:21:30.943]  How do you like what you did, Jones?
[04:21:32.683 --> 04:21:41.831]  We all saw the clip when he was on Piers Morgan, when he said the answer to 1984 was 70-76, when he said if we came for the guns, that there'd be a new revolution in this country.
[04:21:42.111 --> 04:21:45.254]  We all saw what he did!
[04:21:45.514 --> 04:21:46.855]  Yeah, exactly.
[04:21:46.895 --> 04:21:51.299]  And all I said is, you come for the guns, it's gonna cause a new civil war, which is what they've got planned.
[04:21:52.119 --> 04:21:54.361]  And they're gonna come and try to arrest and persecute the gun owners?
[04:21:54.641 --> 04:21:57.324]  A lot are gonna get scared and go, oh, here they are!
[04:21:58.211 --> 04:22:03.101]  I wouldn't be surprised if they have a new gun bill already ready to go in and say, well it was guns that did this, you know?
[04:22:04.810 --> 04:22:06.971]  No, yeah, he bombed because of the guns.
[04:22:07.011 --> 04:22:07.752]  Because of the guns, yeah.
[04:22:08.112 --> 04:22:09.593]  So, we're gonna take them all now.
[04:22:09.613 --> 04:22:14.016]  I mean, it's, it's... Or, wait, wait, I just had an idea.
[04:22:14.276 --> 04:22:34.550]  You notice they've had all these bizarre West Point Army manuals going, you know, Army prepares to crush the Tea Party, Forbes and AP, and with straight face, yes, they're training for an uprising in Boston or in North Carolina, those two areas they mention in them, where the Tea Party joins with Al Qaeda to bomb and shoot.
[04:22:35.150 --> 04:22:37.451]  Yes, the Army believes this is what will happen.
[04:22:37.471 --> 04:22:45.353]  I mean, imagine, I mean, the Tea Party would, literally, if they told a Tea Party person that their child was with Bin Laden, they would throw him in a wood chipper.
[04:22:45.753 --> 04:22:46.393]  Yeah.
[04:22:46.433 --> 04:22:47.254]  But it doesn't matter.
[04:22:47.274 --> 04:22:50.455]  They'll come out and go, you Tea Partiers worked with Al-Qaeda!
[04:22:50.775 --> 04:22:52.975]  And guys will come turn their guns in and salute the government.
[04:22:53.455 --> 04:22:56.796]  I turned them in, I'm in, I'm Al-Qaeda!
[04:22:56.856 --> 04:22:57.617]  And they'll put maybe a...
[04:22:59.980 --> 04:23:01.702]  I'll cut a beard on George Washington.
[04:23:01.722 --> 04:23:02.422]  I'm not joking.
[04:23:02.983 --> 04:23:06.446]  And then people will just spit publicly on George Washington.
[04:23:08.107 --> 04:23:09.468]  I mean, it's that over the top.
[04:23:10.429 --> 04:23:14.793]  They'll have like, maybe Zilker Park, the Army can watch as the public defecates on George Washington.
[04:23:15.013 --> 04:23:16.094]  Public defecation.
[04:23:17.636 --> 04:23:19.157]  I'm being a little over the top here.
[04:23:19.838 --> 04:23:20.738]  Now I'm being absurdist.
[04:23:21.894 --> 04:23:24.696]  But it's already so absurd.
[04:23:24.716 --> 04:23:26.577]  Jerry, what do you have to say about that?
[04:23:26.977 --> 04:23:29.598]  You know, I was in Boston in 2009.
[04:23:29.678 --> 04:23:32.900]  I went there in April to cover the anniversary.
[04:23:32.920 --> 04:23:35.061]  I forget what year anniversary it was.
[04:23:35.242 --> 04:23:35.582]  Oh my gosh!
[04:23:35.622 --> 04:23:37.203]  Oath Keepers is up there right now!
[04:23:37.263 --> 04:23:38.083]  Wait a minute!
[04:23:38.123 --> 04:23:39.344]  Call Stuart Rhodes!
[04:23:39.804 --> 04:23:40.444]  What do we think?
[04:23:40.485 --> 04:23:42.045]  We got Stuart Rhodes on the ground there!
[04:23:42.386 --> 04:23:43.186]  Oh my God!
[04:23:43.446 --> 04:23:46.148]  Wolf Blitzer said, do we have any patriot groups meeting in the area?
[04:23:46.568 --> 04:23:47.328]  Oh my God!
[04:23:47.448 --> 04:23:48.149]  Oh my God!
[04:23:48.469 --> 04:23:48.989]  Oh my God!
[04:23:49.009 --> 04:23:50.090]  I think we may be breaking it.
[04:23:50.270 --> 04:23:52.053]  They may try to blame this on Oath Keepers.
[04:23:52.934 --> 04:23:53.455]  Go after him.
[04:23:53.475 --> 04:23:54.737]  Call his cell phone right now.
[04:23:55.117 --> 04:23:55.718]  Emergency.
[04:23:55.738 --> 04:23:56.600]  Alright, alright, alright.
[04:23:57.540 --> 04:23:59.101]  See how we're wargaming this right now, dude?
[04:23:59.121 --> 04:23:59.301]  Yeah.
[04:23:59.962 --> 04:24:03.504]  Wolf Blitzer goes, are there any of the Patriots Day events happening?
[04:24:03.544 --> 04:24:04.905]  I wonder if it's connected to that.
[04:24:05.666 --> 04:24:11.470]  And of course you know they'll have the Elf Keepers infiltrated, and then they've got Stuart Rhodes and the whole group there saying they did it.
[04:24:11.590 --> 04:24:14.612]  How convenient for the mainstream media.
[04:24:14.632 --> 04:24:15.593]  Oh my gosh.
[04:24:16.273 --> 04:24:19.295]  Stuart Rhodes is in Boston right now.
[04:24:19.616 --> 04:24:20.796]  He wanted to come on the show today.
[04:24:21.297 --> 04:24:23.919]  Last week I got emails from him and forgot to tell Chris Alanis.
[04:24:26.279 --> 04:24:28.180]  Did you just realize what just came together right there?
[04:24:29.781 --> 04:24:31.742]  That was putting the pieces together of how they're doing it.
[04:24:31.883 --> 04:24:39.248]  I mean, do you think that... Well, understand, understand, it's 3.24 Central, 4.24 Eastern, and 38 seconds.
[04:24:39.688 --> 04:24:41.750]  I just said all this before they come out with it.
[04:24:43.111 --> 04:24:45.632]  Now, people... Work that down, guys.
[04:24:45.873 --> 04:24:51.897]  And if I'm right about this, because it looks very bad, people will probably say I was involved because I predicted it.
[04:24:52.237 --> 04:24:52.918]  That's what they said about 9-11.
[04:24:56.192 --> 04:24:57.453]  He realized the magnitude.
[04:24:58.314 --> 04:24:59.695]  Let's pray this isn't the case.
[04:25:00.196 --> 04:25:02.558]  But imagine, Oath Keepers has their big event there every year.
[04:25:02.938 --> 04:25:04.279]  The 15th through the 19th.
[04:25:05.000 --> 04:25:07.202]  You got the Boston Marathon happening at the same time.
[04:25:07.242 --> 04:25:11.226]  Oh, the Army is there, of course, right on time, saving everyone.
[04:25:11.506 --> 04:25:12.166]  You couldn't...
[04:25:13.246 --> 04:25:18.327]  Script this, but I mean, sand people hitting a sand crawler, I've never heard of them hitting something that big.
[04:25:18.547 --> 04:25:21.148]  That's because they didn't, but we're meant to think they did.
[04:25:21.548 --> 04:25:26.069]  Look at these tracks, side by side, only Imperial Stormtroopers are so precise.
[04:25:26.390 --> 04:25:33.691]  We now have the footage of the Army troops fighting to save, which are probably good guys who didn't get pulled out like your brother-in-law.
[04:25:36.452 --> 04:25:37.893]  The scripting is incredible.
[04:25:38.933 --> 04:25:42.334]  Oh my gosh, and you can't go against the troops saving people.
[04:25:43.308 --> 04:25:45.268]  What are your final comments on this?
[04:25:47.229 --> 04:25:50.189]  I think you're going to see more and it's going to get crazier and crazier from here.
[04:25:51.030 --> 04:25:52.050]  That's definitely going to happen.
[04:25:52.210 --> 04:26:06.153]  But what I think we're going to see is they're going to find either a patsy, some guy who's mentally deficient that they've... Or it'll be a McVeigh deal where they set up a special forces guy that can infiltrate Oath Keepers.
[04:26:06.353 --> 04:26:06.453]  Yeah.
[04:26:07.458 --> 04:26:08.178]  And that's possible.
[04:26:08.438 --> 04:26:15.480]  I mean, there have been some, you know, members there and Oath Keepers that haven't, that aren't there anymore, but that have gone on to do different things.
[04:26:16.260 --> 04:26:20.881]  Oh, gee, you don't think the government tried to infiltrate a group trying to wake up the military?
[04:26:21.881 --> 04:26:24.542]  No, that puts billboards outside of bases saying, honor your oath?
[04:26:24.822 --> 04:26:28.723]  No, I don't think they're exposing the Pentagon training to fight the Tea Party?
[04:26:30.325 --> 04:26:33.326]  You don't think they would want to guard the reactor shaft?
[04:26:33.426 --> 04:26:41.107]  Well, it seems like the group of the people who put on that reenactment, they're very closed about who they invite in.
[04:26:41.147 --> 04:26:43.247]  They didn't really want Oath Keepers there a few years ago.
[04:26:43.467 --> 04:26:46.088]  But I think as the time has gone on, they were now like, OK, you know what?
[04:26:46.128 --> 04:26:47.188]  Now you guys can come in.
[04:26:47.208 --> 04:26:51.969]  Now you guys can have your event here, your gathering here.
[04:26:52.529 --> 04:26:53.429]  We're going to let you do it.
[04:26:54.029 --> 04:26:56.390]  And I wonder if that
[04:26:57.515 --> 04:26:59.975]  Is going to backfire now that, oh, you guys let them on.
[04:26:59.995 --> 04:27:01.576]  Yeah, Lexington on the green.
[04:27:02.416 --> 04:27:03.496]  Keep going.
[04:27:03.876 --> 04:27:04.776]  I've seen the statue.
[04:27:04.796 --> 04:27:06.497]  I mean, that's where... Keep going.
[04:27:06.517 --> 04:27:07.017]  Finish your point.
[04:27:07.037 --> 04:27:07.797]  I'll bring in the other guys.
[04:27:07.997 --> 04:27:08.237]  All right.
[04:27:08.777 --> 04:27:10.617]  Well, that's where they shot first.
[04:27:10.657 --> 04:27:13.338]  The British shot first at the colonists who were just there to stand up.
[04:27:13.518 --> 04:27:15.418]  I think they said it's a fight they want.
[04:27:15.618 --> 04:27:16.298]  We'll give it to them.
[04:27:17.719 --> 04:27:20.759]  And... That was on April 19th, but they had Patriots Day on the 15th.
[04:27:22.260 --> 04:27:24.580]  That's weird how Patriots Day is the tax day.
[04:27:25.393 --> 04:27:27.254]  Well, it's also when they like to blow stuff up.
[04:27:27.914 --> 04:27:28.134]  Yeah.
[04:27:28.234 --> 04:27:30.175]  Like they blow up Oklahoma City to blame the Patriots.
[04:27:30.195 --> 04:27:32.096]  Well, we're coming up on Waco and Oklahoma City.
[04:27:32.116 --> 04:27:34.157]  Oh my God, this could be the beginning of a string of bombings.
[04:27:34.377 --> 04:27:34.597]  Yeah.
[04:27:35.098 --> 04:27:36.958]  I got a feeling we're not going to get much rest, brother.
[04:27:37.419 --> 04:27:39.220]  All right, let's bring in Jakari Jackson and everybody else.
[04:27:39.240 --> 04:27:40.640]  You're welcome to stay in here if you want.
[04:27:41.561 --> 04:27:44.062]  I'll get their tag, but they're now saying small homemade bombs.
[04:27:45.595 --> 04:27:48.657]  And how many times has the government been caught staging stuff declassified?
[04:27:48.997 --> 04:27:50.378]  In April.
[04:27:50.938 --> 04:27:51.279]  In April.
[04:27:51.299 --> 04:27:54.621]  So the first thing you've got to do is remember they have a history of being caught.
[04:27:55.281 --> 04:27:58.743]  Ajax, Gulf of Tonkin, Operation Gladio.
[04:27:59.244 --> 04:28:04.687]  You've got the head of the Italian Supreme Court and the head of their CIA saying NATO stages bombings in Europe.
[04:28:05.448 --> 04:28:07.349]  They've been caught doing this over and over again.
[04:28:07.669 --> 04:28:09.830]  They are the prime suspects.
[04:28:10.691 --> 04:28:11.792]  Anything else to do before I bring them in?
[04:28:13.297 --> 04:28:19.962]  I think we're just going to wait and see, watch this unfold, and just watch all the inconsistencies with the reporting, because you're going to see that come out.
[04:28:20.082 --> 04:28:22.464]  Because it's probably not going to be homemade bombs after a while.
[04:28:22.824 --> 04:28:27.808]  It's going to be, these were sophisticated devices that could only have been done by somebody who really knew what they were doing.
[04:28:27.828 --> 04:28:30.349]  Well, remember, they've been teaching police for four years.
[04:28:30.830 --> 04:28:33.632]  Veterans will IED every department in America.
[04:28:34.172 --> 04:28:36.113]  And then the globalists just are mercenaries to IEDs.
[04:28:36.974 --> 04:28:45.522]  Two more devices found to IED police stations and then the police will actually believe all this.
[04:28:46.003 --> 04:28:48.485]  But cops, you know I told you this thousands of times.
[04:28:51.047 --> 04:28:54.791]  I mean, okay, let's... They found two extra bombs in Oklahoma City.
[04:28:55.712 --> 04:28:57.534]  Larger than the first that they kept saying.
[04:28:57.614 --> 04:28:59.115]  And then they disappeared those.
[04:28:59.135 --> 04:29:00.696]  And the cops that saw them, they killed them.
[04:29:02.469 --> 04:29:05.493]  Well, you know, my spider sense has been off the chart because what we are doing is dangerous.
[04:29:05.593 --> 04:29:08.016]  I keep trying to explain to everybody, and not everybody can handle it either.
[04:29:08.036 --> 04:29:10.379]  Not everybody's cut out to fight this, ladies and gentlemen.
[04:29:11.661 --> 04:29:12.902]  Press conference in four minutes.
[04:29:15.029 --> 04:29:16.389]  Oh, they're going to have a field day with this.
[04:29:17.090 --> 04:29:23.111]  Let's go to our video of David Knight's report and come out with a press conference and the guys can stay in here as long as they want.
[04:29:23.151 --> 04:29:30.873]  Let's go to the gun rationing, ammo rationing piece with David Knight and Jakari and the rest of the crew did a great job on this collaborative effort.
[04:29:31.113 --> 04:29:34.454]  Then we'll go to part of the press conference and then we'll bring them in.
[04:29:34.474 --> 04:29:34.774]  Here it is.
[04:29:39.139 --> 04:29:47.766]  I was in an academy about a month ago buying ammo, and you have to go to the front register to get one box of 223, 308, or 40, or 9, all the government stuff.
[04:29:48.046 --> 04:29:53.850]  And I was told by the guys behind the counter, well, trucks come in, there's guys waiting, sometimes it's the police, we try to help them out.
[04:29:54.151 --> 04:29:58.654]  You found one article out of East Texas where the gun shop said they give cops preferential treatment.
[04:29:58.894 --> 04:30:01.156]  The Tennessee Highway Patrol couldn't get ammunition.
[04:30:01.176 --> 04:30:07.120]  The lead story was some police department where they're putting off their qualification because they couldn't get sufficient ammunition.
[04:30:07.140 --> 04:30:07.561]  So I asked,
[04:30:08.061 --> 04:30:12.682]  Art Acevedo, if the Austin Police Department was having any trouble getting ammunition, here's what he said.
[04:30:13.082 --> 04:30:14.363]  One quick question.
[04:30:14.923 --> 04:30:16.943]  Are you having any trouble getting ammunition?
[04:30:16.963 --> 04:30:17.724]  No, actually, no.
[04:30:18.184 --> 04:30:24.165]  So when we heard that, we went out and we looked around Austin to see if we could buy any ammunition from sporting goods stores.
[04:30:25.126 --> 04:30:26.626]  We did some hidden camera stuff.
[04:30:26.826 --> 04:30:27.966]  I believe we all went out.
[04:30:28.066 --> 04:30:31.187]  I went to one of the academies here in Austin.
[04:30:31.507 --> 04:30:33.428]  How many boxes did you buy?
[04:30:34.308 --> 04:30:35.568]  And that's the last one.
[04:30:35.628 --> 04:30:36.629]  Probably.
[04:30:36.649 --> 04:30:36.889]  Yeah.
[04:30:36.909 --> 04:30:46.810]  Just because of what's been going on with the regulations, it's just been as, with the distribution channel, as soon as they can send it to us, it's been kind of a touch and go.
[04:30:46.910 --> 04:30:49.731]  I know we're not getting any ammunition on tonight's truck.
[04:31:00.618 --> 04:31:05.542]  And the guy behind the cashier girl, he said, well, you can buy two if you have somebody else buy one.
[04:31:05.882 --> 04:31:09.044]  But the cashier girl is telling me, no, this is our last box.
[04:31:09.244 --> 04:31:12.467]  And how many boxes do you have left?
[04:31:12.587 --> 04:31:13.487]  And that's the last one.
[04:31:13.607 --> 04:31:14.248]  Oh, really?
[04:31:14.288 --> 04:31:14.388]  Yeah.
[04:31:14.548 --> 04:31:16.009]  Definitely is bullet rationing.
[04:31:16.029 --> 04:31:17.370]  Do they line up outside?
[04:31:17.470 --> 04:31:18.791]  Every day since December.
[04:31:19.212 --> 04:31:21.453]  Wow, so people- There's probably 25 people.
[04:31:22.054 --> 04:31:24.055]  People start lining up at 4 or 5?
[04:31:24.375 --> 04:31:26.237]  They start at 4 for the AR-15.
[04:31:27.097 --> 04:31:29.918]  Is it worth coming back to get, or are you getting much?
[04:31:30.058 --> 04:31:33.019]  I mean, when we do, it has been like 8 or 10 cases.
[04:31:33.059 --> 04:31:35.240]  You're talking about boxes, right?
[04:31:35.320 --> 04:31:35.540]  Yeah.
[04:31:35.560 --> 04:31:38.481]  Like, yeah, sorry, just individual boxes.
[04:31:38.541 --> 04:31:41.082]  So it's very, very, uh, very little.
[04:31:41.142 --> 04:31:41.922]  Oh, okay.
[04:31:41.962 --> 04:31:49.965]  We have one guy that's here every morning, and he changes clothes, and thinks we don't recognize him.
[04:31:50.045 --> 04:31:51.365]  Oh, man, okay.
[04:31:51.645 --> 04:31:52.706]  And they get here at 4 a.m.
[04:31:53.786 --> 04:31:57.687]  You gotta get online, probably about 6-30.
[04:31:57.807 --> 04:31:59.728]  It's gotta be 3rd, 2nd, and 3rd online.
[04:31:59.788 --> 04:32:03.949]  Have you seen the police go in here and get that on?
[04:32:04.029 --> 04:32:07.710]  Yeah, just individually?
[04:32:07.750 --> 04:32:09.570]  Yeah, yeah.
[04:32:09.650 --> 04:32:14.071]  Are you having any trouble getting the ammunition?
[04:32:14.091 --> 04:32:15.572]  No, actually no.
[04:32:15.632 --> 04:32:15.772]  Okay.
[04:32:16.952 --> 04:32:19.174]  Tell me, how do I get 223 more than just one box?
[04:32:19.194 --> 04:32:22.536]  He goes, well, we were selling it right out of the truck to whoever got there first.
[04:32:22.556 --> 04:32:23.998]  We try to help the police out first.
[04:32:24.458 --> 04:32:27.861]  So I think Acevedo, maybe he's getting from the feds, Homeland Security.
[04:32:27.901 --> 04:32:29.382]  I mean, I certainly got connections.
[04:32:29.442 --> 04:32:33.985]  Tuesday, Chief Acevedo tweeted a picture of himself in the West Wing of the White House.
[04:32:34.346 --> 04:32:40.090]  He's meeting with Vice President Joe Biden, along with other law enforcement officials, to push for legislation.
[04:32:40.110 --> 04:32:42.312]  Are you having a cocaine addiction?
[04:32:42.352 --> 04:32:43.012]  No, actually, no.
[04:32:44.093 --> 04:32:46.356]  He's up all week with talking to Biden.
[04:32:46.396 --> 04:32:49.359]  And he's not just standing behind him, he's on the news with the Vice President.
[04:32:49.559 --> 04:32:50.460]  Yeah, and he's very confident.
[04:32:50.521 --> 04:32:52.403]  He said, I have no problems getting ammunition.
[04:32:52.483 --> 04:32:53.224]  El Diablo!
[04:32:53.364 --> 04:32:58.670]  We've seen the articles in other organizations, police organizations, where they're having trouble getting ammunitions.
[04:32:58.690 --> 04:33:03.555]  The public and even many law enforcement organizations are experiencing shortages and rationing.
[04:33:04.216 --> 04:33:11.700]  Homeland Security's orders for over 1.6 billion bullets is coming out of the same manufacturers that would supply the public and law enforcement.
[04:33:11.740 --> 04:33:14.161]  Is Homeland Security creating a shortage of ammunition?
[04:33:14.441 --> 04:33:19.344]  Is buying up the supply of ammo a way of doing gun control without having to pass laws?
[04:33:25.647 --> 04:33:33.311]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[04:33:38.789 --> 04:33:39.310]  Well we're back.
[04:33:39.670 --> 04:33:45.315]  I'm David Knight and I've got Jakari Jackson here in the studio with me while Alex takes a break because this is a big breaking news day.
[04:33:46.138 --> 04:33:49.180]  I think we're going to see this and look back in years to come.
[04:33:49.200 --> 04:33:51.461]  This is going to be another 9-11, don't you think, Jakari?
[04:33:51.521 --> 04:33:51.981]  Oh, yeah.
[04:33:52.401 --> 04:33:56.583]  It's definitely going to be taken very seriously, you know, the initial reports.
[04:33:56.743 --> 04:33:58.924]  The story keeps changing as more information comes about.
[04:33:58.964 --> 04:34:06.068]  I believe it was one dead and two dead, and now I believe it's three dead, or I think it's two dead and 21 injured was the last.
[04:34:06.088 --> 04:34:06.228]  Yeah, 28.
[04:34:06.268 --> 04:34:06.868]  28, yeah.
[04:34:06.928 --> 04:34:07.708]  I'm telling you, it's 28 now.
[04:34:09.249 --> 04:34:13.332]  Well, what's different about this is that this is a bombing like we've seen in the Middle East.
[04:34:13.873 --> 04:34:17.336]  This is something that they've been building for for quite some time.
[04:34:17.396 --> 04:34:26.403]  I mean, we go back and we look at all these efforts from DHS this last year, and we're going to be going to a news conference coming up in just a little bit, but we're going to talk about where this might be headed here.
[04:34:27.203 --> 04:34:37.452]  But just like we saw with the underwear bomber, I mean, they had the x-ray scanners ready to go into the airport, and that was clearly a staged event, and we had
[04:34:38.867 --> 04:34:42.288]  Haskell, who was eyewitness, we've had on the news here many times.
[04:34:43.288 --> 04:34:52.971]  And we see that for quite some time they've been building up here, Homeland Security, these bulletproof boxes to go and checkpoints everywhere.
[04:34:53.791 --> 04:34:54.871]  What do you think they're going to do with this?
[04:34:55.231 --> 04:35:01.573]  I think they have it all ready, regardless if this comes out to be staged or, you know, it's some real lone nut out there.
[04:35:02.273 --> 04:35:03.213]  I think they're ready to go.
[04:35:03.913 --> 04:35:06.474]  Either way, I think they're ready to go with the pillboxes, they're ready to go.
[04:35:07.715 --> 04:35:14.881]  With your domestic checkpoints, with your TSA, and your shopping malls, and your grocery stores, and wherever else they're at, they've just been waiting for something like this.
[04:35:14.901 --> 04:35:20.225]  For the longest time, the TSA, and it is the travel security agency, right?
[04:35:20.285 --> 04:35:21.946]  It is not airport, right?
[04:35:21.986 --> 04:35:23.768]  And for the longest time they've been building outside of that.
[04:35:23.808 --> 04:35:34.056]  Just a few years ago, you would try to tell people that they're going to leave the airports very soon, and now they're doing bus checks, they're doing the hyper teams, they're way beyond the reach of the airport.
[04:35:34.176 --> 04:35:34.657]  Absolutely.
[04:35:35.257 --> 04:35:36.317]  Absolutely, yeah.
[04:35:36.538 --> 04:35:46.761]  I think we're going to look back at this, and you know, however this comes, and we're seeing some early accusations already being leveled at Patriots and homemade bombs and that sort of thing.
[04:35:46.801 --> 04:35:59.325]  However they do this, I believe that they're going to use this as a justification, because everything that they do is set up to put security and safety as the ultimate thing, right, over liberty.
[04:35:59.665 --> 04:36:01.406]  You know, forget your liberty, you need to be safe.
[04:36:02.426 --> 04:36:04.407]  And it's just a fool's bargain.
[04:36:04.967 --> 04:36:11.653]  Exactly, because they do the TSA pat-downs at the football games, at the baseball games, at the basketball games now.
[04:36:12.074 --> 04:36:20.081]  And you think about it, people are getting so used and accustomed to these type of procedures, because you pay, I don't know how much it costs, $3,000 to go to the Super Bowl.
[04:36:20.442 --> 04:36:23.945]  When you get there and they're patting people down, you're not going to say, well, I'm not going to go in there because they're patting people down.
[04:36:23.965 --> 04:36:24.686]  You're going to go through it.
[04:36:25.566 --> 04:36:27.828]  Regardless of whether you like it or not, then you just get used to it.
[04:36:28.148 --> 04:36:34.253]  Okay, so it's at the Super Bowl today, next week it's at the grocery store, and now if I want to go see a movie, I gotta get padded down.
[04:36:34.533 --> 04:36:38.896]  It just gets the... And it's the conditioning, as Alex pointed out before the Dark Knight came out.
[04:36:38.936 --> 04:36:39.536]  You could see it.
[04:36:39.877 --> 04:36:43.299]  Everybody knew that it was going to have this big scene of a terrorist event in a football stadium.
[04:36:43.579 --> 04:36:44.600]  Because it was in the previews.
[04:36:45.260 --> 04:36:53.187]  And you see that, and even though something like that hadn't happened, and still hasn't happened, it has this visceral effect on you.
[04:36:53.567 --> 04:36:55.608]  It embeds itself into your memory.
[04:36:55.689 --> 04:36:57.970]  You know, just like you see, you know, Pulp Fiction.
[04:36:58.010 --> 04:37:01.613]  You know, you see the guy, you know, jamming a hypodermic needle in somebody's chest.
[04:37:01.633 --> 04:37:04.215]  I mean, those are the kind of images that stick with you.
[04:37:04.856 --> 04:37:11.241]  And so, when somebody goes to a football event, and they're getting harassed, and the resentment starts to build up.
[04:37:11.881 --> 04:37:15.324]  And speaking of movies, I saw recently the G.I.
[04:37:15.344 --> 04:37:17.745]  Joe movie, and in the movie Bruce Willis is this retired general.
[04:37:26.732 --> 04:37:32.174]  The thing that made me amazed this movie stick out is when he goes to his house he has all these guns in his house.
[04:37:32.194 --> 04:37:33.775]  You know it's almost cartoonish level.
[04:37:33.835 --> 04:37:38.137]  He has guns in his cabinet and in his trash can and wherever else.
[04:37:38.517 --> 04:37:41.318]  But the code to get into his big gun safe he types in 1776.
[04:37:41.698 --> 04:37:49.281]  That's the code to get into his big war chest to get all his ammunition and arms.
[04:37:50.142 --> 04:37:52.503]  So I definitely think that they're getting people ready trying to
[04:37:53.483 --> 04:37:58.147]  If not demonize, at least make it cartoonish to the fact it was in the movie of the notion of 1776.
[04:37:58.207 --> 04:37:58.667]  Yeah.
[04:37:58.687 --> 04:38:01.470]  Revolution standing up.
[04:38:02.210 --> 04:38:02.651]  Right.
[04:38:02.871 --> 04:38:03.811]  Whatever means necessary.
[04:38:03.871 --> 04:38:08.955]  Well, I tell you, you know, and we got to say... Not that we're advocating any kind of violence, let me throw that out there.
[04:38:08.996 --> 04:38:12.378]  We're looking downstream to see what the fallout from this is going to be.
[04:38:12.398 --> 04:38:14.320]  And we already know because we've seen what they did.
[04:38:14.440 --> 04:38:19.544]  We already knew, we knew when September 11th happened what was going to happen to the rest of us, what they're going to do domestically.
[04:38:20.224 --> 04:38:22.907]  And with the Patriot Act and that sort of thing that eventually came up.
[04:38:22.947 --> 04:38:24.829]  And so we're taking the long view now.
[04:38:24.869 --> 04:38:26.550]  We're looking down the road to see what's happening.
[04:38:26.590 --> 04:38:32.215]  But, you know, we got to say our hearts really go out to the people who have been killed and injured here and their families.
[04:38:33.096 --> 04:38:37.740]  I mean, you know, that's the saddest thing is in these events, so many people die.
[04:38:37.761 --> 04:38:43.306]  And in many cases, we believe the perpetrators are not caught.
[04:38:43.966 --> 04:38:54.499]  And that's one of the saddest things, but people tend to fall behind this and say, you know, and essentially embrace the official story just because they want a resolution.
[04:38:54.519 --> 04:38:56.842]  They want it tied up nice and neatly, you know.
[04:38:56.982 --> 04:38:59.425]  And we see that when you have a cop murdered, you know.
[04:38:59.445 --> 04:39:01.788]  There was a very good documentary, The Thin Blue Line.
[04:39:02.288 --> 04:39:05.932]  And they rushed to judgment to capture a guy because a cop had been killed.
[04:39:06.172 --> 04:39:07.534]  So they wanted to get somebody right away.
[04:39:07.554 --> 04:39:08.775]  And it was the wrong guy.
[04:39:08.835 --> 04:39:15.062]  And in the process of doing that documentary, Errol Morris found out, you know, proved that he was innocent and even got the killer to confess.
[04:39:15.462 --> 04:39:21.128]  So there's always this rush to try to do something for the victims and for the families.
[04:39:22.089 --> 04:39:23.110]  Often they do the wrong thing.
[04:39:23.130 --> 04:39:28.335]  That's a very true statement there because you can see the cases I've seen of murders.
[04:39:28.735 --> 04:39:38.244]  People have their family member murdered and the police and the DA or whoever tells them it was Joe and you know they go on believing that for years and then ten years later whatever the evidence comes out that it's not Joe.
[04:39:38.604 --> 04:39:46.952]  And just like I said, a guy could come forward and say okay my name is Bob and I killed him and the family just can't still get over the fact that you know they believed it was Joe for so long.
[04:39:46.972 --> 04:39:47.072]  Yeah.
[04:39:47.332 --> 04:39:47.652]  Yeah.
[04:39:47.672 --> 04:39:48.393]  Hard to break that.
[04:40:05.021 --> 04:40:13.006]  And there are other people involved, but they just wanted to focus in on these two guys just to, like you said, wrap it up in a neat little package so you can't have any loose strings.
[04:40:13.547 --> 04:40:18.470]  We just want the lone nut scenario to go on to this story.
[04:40:18.610 --> 04:40:19.931]  Yeah, I remember when that happened.
[04:40:20.271 --> 04:40:26.215]  And I remember thinking, crime, BS, when that happened because of the quick way that they caught Timothy McVeigh.
[04:40:26.235 --> 04:40:28.577]  In fact, no license plates or something like that.
[04:40:28.637 --> 04:40:32.079]  It was so immediately.
[04:40:32.099 --> 04:40:34.501]  And here he is, this big mastermind, and he does that.
[04:40:34.881 --> 04:40:42.589]  But above and beyond that, I remember the New American magazine at the time, because that was really before internet was out there.
[04:40:43.250 --> 04:40:45.852]  We had bulletin boards that we'd pass information back and forth on.
[04:40:45.892 --> 04:40:54.001]  But the New American ran a series of articles with a retired general, I can't remember the guy's name, who was a demolitions expert.
[04:40:54.461 --> 04:40:59.464]  And he said there was absolutely no way a single bomb was going to create that blast pattern.
[04:41:00.025 --> 04:41:01.886]  And he was absolutely certain of that.
[04:41:02.446 --> 04:41:06.028]  And, you know, the excellent documentary that we've got here, A Noble Lie.
[04:41:06.129 --> 04:41:07.049]  I mean, if people want to see that.
[04:41:10.451 --> 04:41:14.293]  The research that they did in that documentary, I mean, there's a lot more to that.
[04:41:14.653 --> 04:41:15.934]  But I mean, just those two things.
[04:41:16.234 --> 04:41:24.657]  And just, I mean, it's a pretty big deal when the blast pattern, when a retired general says the blast pattern could not have come from a single bomb like their narrative.
[04:41:24.878 --> 04:41:25.018]  Right.
[04:41:25.058 --> 04:41:31.640]  You know, that's enough right there to say, hold the horses, let's go back and look at the, but then you can look at all the rest of the stuff that happened, how they took that grand juror,
[04:41:33.262 --> 04:41:33.742]  What was his name?
[04:41:33.762 --> 04:41:34.423]  Huppie Heidelberg.
[04:41:34.463 --> 04:41:35.124]  Yeah.
[04:41:35.204 --> 04:41:37.306]  How they threw him off because he was asking questions.
[04:41:37.326 --> 04:41:38.368]  He was a mayor or a governor?
[04:41:38.508 --> 04:41:38.768]  Yeah, yeah.
[04:41:38.868 --> 04:41:48.680]  So he got involved politically and they never did shut him up but they did throw him off the grand jury because he was asking questions and that was his duty as a grand juror to ask those kind of questions in an investigation.
[04:41:49.361 --> 04:41:51.902]  They don't like that when you ask, when you ask questions.
[04:41:52.583 --> 04:41:53.904]  Let's talk about something like 9-11.
[04:41:54.084 --> 04:42:05.770]  You know, regardless, you know, people listening out there, regardless of what your view on 9-11 is, they have eyewitness testimony of people in the tower say, hey, before the building collapsed, I heard bombs in there.
[04:42:06.130 --> 04:42:17.597]  And then they try to spin it as saying that it was gas trapped in the elevator shaft or, you know, some other type of ridiculous account that was popping out windows and steel girders and all this stuff before the towers ever collapsed.
[04:42:17.677 --> 04:42:17.817]  Yeah.
[04:42:18.097 --> 04:42:18.297]  Yeah.
[04:42:18.317 --> 04:42:25.022]  And they just disregard, you know, there could be somebody come out today and like, yeah, it was a trash can fire or trash can bomb or whatever it was.
[04:42:25.042 --> 04:42:25.843]  No, no, no.
[04:42:25.883 --> 04:42:29.065]  That doesn't line up with our official story if we want what we want to be.
[04:42:29.345 --> 04:42:32.027]  Just a second ago, they were playing the clip on, I believe it was CNN.
[04:42:32.488 --> 04:42:36.911]  And Joe Biden comes out and says, yes, the bombing at the the Boston Marathon.
[04:42:36.971 --> 04:42:38.212]  And then the CNN person comes back.
[04:42:38.252 --> 04:42:39.953]  Well, we don't know exactly what it is.
[04:42:39.973 --> 04:42:41.274]  I'm like, that's the vice president.
[04:42:41.314 --> 04:42:45.197]  I think he's pretty, you know, pretty knowledgeable as far as what's going on.
[04:42:45.738 --> 04:42:47.339]  But maybe that doesn't fit into their
[04:42:47.659 --> 04:42:48.280]  We're good to go.
[04:43:09.287 --> 04:43:12.990]  I saw they detonated about 15 minutes apart and less than half a mile apart.
[04:43:13.110 --> 04:43:14.051]  They detonated.
[04:43:14.471 --> 04:43:25.080]  But then I saw all these reports of other bombs being found and I thought, well, that may or may not be true because in this type of situation, a lot of people are going to start calling people up and saying, I think this is a bomb out here.
[04:43:25.100 --> 04:43:26.081]  They're going to start panicking.
[04:43:26.121 --> 04:43:29.284]  But now it looks like they've found several more that are undetonated.
[04:43:30.124 --> 04:43:52.663]  Yes, and it's I have a breaking news story here and the two dead several dozen hurt an explosion So we have confirmed there are at least two dead and as many as 40 patients injured in the local hospital reports CBS Boston and We'll definitely try to keep you up to date as the information and some of these some of these injuries are going to be very significant because you can see from the
[04:43:53.726 --> 04:43:54.547]  Aerial photographs.
[04:43:55.087 --> 04:44:00.432]  There's a lot of blood that you can see even from the helicopters, people reporting people lost limbs, that sort of thing.
[04:44:00.552 --> 04:44:02.254]  It's a really horrific event.
[04:44:02.274 --> 04:44:03.175]  You can see it right there.
[04:44:03.275 --> 04:44:03.455]  Yeah.
[04:44:04.076 --> 04:44:04.776]  It's terrible.
[04:44:04.816 --> 04:44:07.479]  It looks like some type of cell phone photo, but... But you know...
[04:44:08.436 --> 04:44:09.698]  We need to keep this in perspective.
[04:44:09.718 --> 04:44:10.899]  We're talking about taking the long view.
[04:44:11.700 --> 04:44:16.926]  We need to keep this in perspective that, you know, a lot of people have died to keep our freedoms.
[04:44:17.246 --> 04:44:17.607]  Exactly.
[04:44:17.707 --> 04:44:21.992]  A lot of people in the military have taken that oath to support the Constitution.
[04:44:22.372 --> 04:44:24.795]  They fought wars to keep our freedoms.
[04:44:25.476 --> 04:44:29.080]  And it is not something that should be surrendered for safety.
[04:44:29.780 --> 04:44:39.265]  No, we have the founders, you know, we have Franklin saying that those who surrender their liberties for the promise of security don't deserve either.
[04:44:39.305 --> 04:44:42.286]  And, you know, we say it's just a promise because they will not deliver it.
[04:44:42.366 --> 04:44:42.927]  And the best
[04:44:43.644 --> 04:44:46.647]  Safeguard for your safety is to have a free society.
[04:44:47.028 --> 04:45:06.028]  If we surrender our freedoms, if we surrender our due process, if we surrender our dignity as people, and if we are going to say that, take some kind of an attitude that, well, that's fine, I'll let the TSA stop me whenever they want to, go into my pants whenever they want to, I'll let them x-ray me, scan me,
[04:45:06.608 --> 04:45:09.670]  You know, take me to the ground with police dogs anytime I go shopping.
[04:45:10.411 --> 04:45:10.951]  I'm sorry.
[04:45:11.371 --> 04:45:12.952]  There is no risk for me.
[04:45:13.292 --> 04:45:16.875]  There is no risk that is going to make that acceptable.
[04:45:17.215 --> 04:45:18.276]  How free are you?
[04:45:18.296 --> 04:45:19.837]  We've done the stories here in Austin.
[04:45:19.857 --> 04:45:22.378]  They do the no-refusal DUI weekends.
[04:45:22.458 --> 04:45:23.679]  In some places they do it year-round.
[04:45:23.719 --> 04:45:25.120]  I believe in San Antonio they do.
[04:45:25.560 --> 04:45:30.864]  The police can pull you over, you know, say you swerve a little bit in your car, they can pull you over, draw your blood without your consent.
[04:45:31.204 --> 04:45:36.107]  And Antonio Beeler, when he was talking to you on that interview, said he had a friend who had had his blood pulled.
[04:45:36.167 --> 04:45:37.768]  He wouldn't consent because he hadn't been drinking.
[04:45:37.989 --> 04:45:38.189]  Right.
[04:45:38.529 --> 04:45:39.830]  And they did it to him anyway.
[04:45:39.910 --> 04:45:41.971]  Stuck a needle in his arm, pulled blood out, and he had a 0.0.
[04:45:42.071 --> 04:45:43.432]  He had no alcohol.
[04:45:43.452 --> 04:45:48.095]  I mean, when they can take something from inside your body, I mean, how free are you?
[04:45:48.155 --> 04:45:48.796]  Yeah, yeah.
[04:45:48.956 --> 04:45:55.380]  I mean, can you imagine if they had done that sort of thing, if the British soldiers had done that sort of thing to the colonists at the time?
[04:45:55.400 --> 04:45:56.821]  You know, they would have never stood for that.
[04:45:56.861 --> 04:46:00.644]  I mean, there were some pretty severe violations of their civil liberties, but nothing
[04:46:01.184 --> 04:46:18.019]  Like, it's within the power of the state, and that's what people have to understand, that with a modern technocratic society, the way technology has leveraged their power, if we give them a monopoly on power, if we give them a monopoly on technology and on weapons and that sort of thing, we do not...
[04:46:18.639 --> 04:46:23.123]  Realize the depths of tyranny that we're going to subject ourselves to.
[04:46:23.163 --> 04:46:29.188]  There has never been that kind of potential for power abuse in the history of this planet as we have right now.
[04:46:34.632 --> 04:46:43.296]  That's what the check and balance is, because yeah, they can go build their new war machines, but meanwhile we have a guy who can make an AR-15 out of his printer at his house, you know?
[04:46:43.677 --> 04:46:46.078]  There's a check and balance to that, and people, they don't understand that.
[04:46:46.098 --> 04:46:50.460]  They just want the government to have a monopoly of whatever, and it's not necessarily arms.
[04:46:50.500 --> 04:46:54.962]  It could be different forms of technology, or different advances, and whatever else it may be.
[04:46:54.982 --> 04:46:55.602]  That's right.
[04:46:55.622 --> 04:46:57.383]  But that's what, you have to have that check and balance.
[04:46:57.423 --> 04:46:57.783]  That's right.
[04:46:58.724 --> 04:47:03.006]  But the really sad thing is, I don't know, I think this is even going to affect the gun control debate.
[04:47:03.590 --> 04:47:12.983]  Because the people who are panicked about this and who are willing to sell, not only enslave themselves and make themselves subjects to anybody in a uniform, but they're willing to enslave us.
[04:47:13.484 --> 04:47:15.246]  They're willing to enslave everybody else.
[04:47:15.827 --> 04:47:18.892]  Those kinds of people are going to be redoubled in their
[04:47:19.172 --> 04:47:20.813]  It's paranoia and fear.
[04:47:40.559 --> 04:47:47.605]  One's holding an AR-15 and the caption reads, uh, one of these items is banned in your public schools and they have a picture of a little girl.
[04:47:47.625 --> 04:47:52.449]  She's holding a little red riding hood and a little red riding that has a bottle of wine.
[04:47:52.929 --> 04:47:56.792]  And they're saying, well, they banned this little red riding hood book because she has a bottle of wine.
[04:47:56.812 --> 04:47:59.935]  But meanwhile, guns are welcome in our schools or something to that narrative.
[04:47:59.975 --> 04:48:02.697]  If they can find the image, I'd like to show that to our viewers.
[04:48:02.777 --> 04:48:04.939]  I don't think that they're any more likely to get.
[04:48:05.359 --> 04:48:10.020]  And they are 15 legally into a school and they are a bottle of wine, frankly.
[04:48:10.821 --> 04:48:12.961]  And that's the thing we keep hearing from them.
[04:48:12.981 --> 04:48:14.762]  It's like, oh yeah, we got to get the guns out of the school.
[04:48:14.802 --> 04:48:18.943]  It's like, well, if your laws could keep the guns out of the school, there wouldn't be any guns in the school.
[04:48:19.083 --> 04:48:22.504]  Because it's against the laws of federal law that you don't have any guns in the school.
[04:48:22.584 --> 04:48:24.944]  So the very fact that you've got all these school shootings.
[04:48:24.964 --> 04:48:25.845]  There's the image right there.
[04:48:25.865 --> 04:48:27.265]  I don't know if you guys can zoom in anymore.
[04:48:28.240 --> 04:48:37.512]  But for our radio listeners, there's an image you can go to, Moms Demand Action, and it's a picture of two little girls who are sitting in a library.
[04:48:37.532 --> 04:48:42.899]  One of the girls is holding an AR-15, and the other one is holding a copy of Little Red Riding Hood.
[04:48:44.321 --> 04:48:51.165]  They said the reason Little Red Riding Hood is banned is because Little Red Riding Hood has a bottle of wine in her basket.
[04:48:51.526 --> 04:48:54.407]  And I'm not sure why a child would have a bottle of wine anyway.
[04:48:55.008 --> 04:48:58.050]  But, uh, that's, uh... And, you know, you see that all the time.
[04:48:58.070 --> 04:48:59.811]  You're gonna have that group out there pushing
[04:49:00.271 --> 04:49:01.933]  You know, I don't know what they're going to push next.
[04:49:01.953 --> 04:49:08.700]  They already went out there and said that they want reasonable gun restrictions, but applauded when Mike Martinez said he wants to take all of our guns.
[04:49:08.880 --> 04:49:09.160]  Oh yeah.
[04:49:09.180 --> 04:49:10.502]  I'm wondering what the next step is.
[04:49:10.522 --> 04:49:13.204]  Yeah, he said he's going to make that gun ban sign legitimate.
[04:49:13.365 --> 04:49:13.505]  Oh yeah.
[04:49:13.525 --> 04:49:14.185]  He's going to make that.
[04:49:15.447 --> 04:49:18.790]  That's such a ridiculous picture, the one that they just pulled up that you're talking about.
[04:49:19.691 --> 04:49:23.694]  Who's ever seen a child sitting in a library with an AR-15 in her lap?
[04:49:23.874 --> 04:49:23.994]  No.
[04:49:24.054 --> 04:49:27.257]  Or a child sitting unattended anywhere with an AR-15 in their lap.
[04:49:27.297 --> 04:49:31.100]  I mean, that's really, you know, a strawman argument, really.
[04:49:34.382 --> 04:49:35.022]  New York Post.
[04:49:37.845 --> 04:49:38.865]  They've got a suspect now.
[04:49:40.887 --> 04:49:42.688]  The New York Post has already found a suspect.
[04:49:43.028 --> 04:49:44.970]  Guarded at the hospital, is that correct?
[04:49:45.939 --> 04:49:46.680]  Yes, I believe.
[04:49:47.000 --> 04:49:48.801]  Yeah, okay.
[04:49:48.941 --> 04:49:51.723]  So they've got a suspect in the hospital under guard.
[04:49:51.743 --> 04:49:55.866]  Okay, so do we know if it's multiple suspects or just preliminary?
[04:49:55.946 --> 04:49:57.247]  Okay, so we'll wait and see.
[04:49:57.287 --> 04:50:01.730]  They may have more than one, but as of right now, we do have confirmed one New York Post.
[04:50:02.951 --> 04:50:03.632]  We'll wait and see.
[04:50:03.872 --> 04:50:04.933]  Well, that didn't take them too long.
[04:50:04.953 --> 04:50:06.053]  It's 12 now?
[04:50:07.785 --> 04:50:08.445]  Yeah, we got another.
[04:50:08.465 --> 04:50:09.766]  Which one is this?
[04:50:10.066 --> 04:50:12.086]  12 dead and nearly 50 injured.
[04:50:12.667 --> 04:50:14.367]  Okay, this is a post as well.
[04:50:14.427 --> 04:50:15.407]  It says 12 dead.
[04:50:15.908 --> 04:50:17.368]  Perhaps some people died in the hospital.
[04:50:17.408 --> 04:50:18.869]  That's definitely a possibility.
[04:50:18.889 --> 04:50:20.929]  12 dead.
[04:50:21.189 --> 04:50:21.389]  Wow.
[04:50:21.749 --> 04:50:21.950]  Wow.
[04:50:22.410 --> 04:50:25.391]  And they don't say anything about who that suspect is?
[04:50:25.491 --> 04:50:26.431]  Or no information?
[04:50:26.471 --> 04:50:27.571]  Just a suspect, right?
[04:50:27.911 --> 04:50:28.612]  A suspect.
[04:50:29.232 --> 04:50:29.792]  Okay.
[04:50:29.812 --> 04:50:30.092]  Alright.
[04:50:30.392 --> 04:50:30.752]  We don't know.
[04:50:30.772 --> 04:50:31.192]  Let's see.
[04:50:31.813 --> 04:50:32.193]  Wow, that's...
[04:50:33.200 --> 04:50:36.201]  But again, you know, when we look at this and we say, you know, where is this going to head?
[04:50:36.901 --> 04:50:38.762]  You know, we've been warning people about this.
[04:50:38.802 --> 04:50:40.202]  I mean, we can see the Army documents.
[04:50:40.262 --> 04:50:53.267]  We can see, as Alex was saying earlier, you know, you've got a Colonel Rich, Lieutenant Colonel Rich, that just identified American Family Association and Family Research Council as hate groups.
[04:50:53.347 --> 04:50:57.168]  I mean, this is just going right down the talking points of the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[04:50:57.808 --> 04:50:59.429]  Putting them in the same category as Westboro.
[04:51:00.576 --> 04:51:02.097]  Now we've got a press conference coming up.
[04:51:03.678 --> 04:51:05.540]  Is this Biden or Obama?
[04:51:05.720 --> 04:51:08.942]  I don't know that there's any connection yet, and hopefully there won't be.
[04:51:09.482 --> 04:51:13.125]  But we're a long way from knowing whether this is homegrown or not.
[04:51:13.485 --> 04:51:14.706]  Just one other comment, Jake.
[04:51:15.683 --> 04:51:20.087]  I know this may be hard to hear, but one of the things we have to show in this country is resilience.
[04:51:20.988 --> 04:51:24.070]  These have been, so far, small bomb attacks.
[04:51:24.150 --> 04:51:29.915]  It is horrific that we have lost two or three lives and that dozens are injured.
[04:51:30.896 --> 04:51:35.158]  We can't stop our entire economy and dwell on this.
[04:51:35.258 --> 04:51:42.760]  What we have to do is, in a very targeted way, use our counterterrorism resources and our law enforcement resources and found out who did this.
[04:51:42.820 --> 04:51:45.542]  We have to move crowds safely out of harm's way.
[04:51:45.882 --> 04:51:48.182]  But it would be terrible to shut down our country.
[04:51:48.223 --> 04:51:51.644]  Then the bad guys, if they're out there, really do win.
[04:51:51.864 --> 04:51:54.805]  And we have to show we're not terrorized by these awful facts.
[04:51:54.825 --> 04:51:57.746]  I want to play some sound from some eyewitnesses right now.
[04:51:57.766 --> 04:51:59.807]  To go to this stupid press conference salon.
[04:52:00.807 --> 04:52:05.730]  This explosion is already going after me and expanding on this.
[04:52:06.210 --> 04:52:07.571]  You hear, we've got to be resilient.
[04:52:07.611 --> 04:52:12.014]  They're bringing in a military or like an Israeli idea, like Israel's under attack.
[04:52:12.074 --> 04:52:13.494]  It's like the government's going to protect you.
[04:52:13.735 --> 04:52:14.635]  This is a new way of life.
[04:52:14.855 --> 04:52:16.416]  We'll fight back against this unseen enemy.
[04:52:16.896 --> 04:52:17.617]  Here's how we do it.
[04:52:17.637 --> 04:52:18.617]  You turn your guns in.
[04:52:19.058 --> 04:52:20.218]  We have checkpoints everywhere.
[04:52:20.458 --> 04:52:23.360]  This is the conversion from the free country to total slavery.
[04:52:23.600 --> 04:52:24.441]  This is it right now.
[04:52:24.721 --> 04:52:25.581]  Gentlemen, continue.
[04:52:25.901 --> 04:52:26.702]  Here's the press conference.
[04:52:28.447 --> 04:52:30.728]  Threw them, ran as fast as we could down here to get blood.
[04:52:30.928 --> 04:52:32.148]  They were banged up bad.
[04:52:33.169 --> 04:52:34.209]  Severe lacerations.
[04:52:34.409 --> 04:52:38.531]  Okay, seems like we've got some eyewitness testimony going on in there for a second.
[04:52:38.911 --> 04:52:42.232]  So, the press conference I guess is not quite ready yet.
[04:52:42.693 --> 04:52:46.774]  Yeah, but we've already got calls, just as Alex was saying, we've already got calls for fundamental transformation.
[04:52:46.814 --> 04:52:48.315]  Okay, we have somebody coming up.
[04:52:48.775 --> 04:52:53.462]  The press conference with Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis is about to begin.
[04:52:53.522 --> 04:52:55.064]  Here's Governor Deval Patrick.
[04:52:56.266 --> 04:52:58.529]  Mindful that we don't have the whole picture yet.
[04:52:59.689 --> 04:53:02.810]  But we have gotten a good deal of information.
[04:53:02.850 --> 04:53:14.754]  Commissioner Davis will take all of us through the information that we have, and then I'll come back and talk about some of the things and ways in which we're going to ask people to help us help you this afternoon.
[04:53:14.794 --> 04:53:18.975]  So let me turn it over now to Ed Davis, Commissioner of Police here in Boston.
[04:53:21.164 --> 04:53:22.125]  Thank you Governor.
[04:53:22.445 --> 04:53:24.526]  At 2.50 p.m.
[04:53:25.367 --> 04:53:31.991]  today there were simultaneous explosions that occurred along the route of the Boston Marathon near the finish line.
[04:53:33.553 --> 04:53:41.838]  These explosions occurred 50 to 100 yards apart and each scene resulted in multiple casualties.
[04:53:43.679 --> 04:53:47.622]  At this point in time all of the victims have been removed from the scene.
[04:53:49.303 --> 04:53:49.684]  We have
[04:53:51.340 --> 04:53:57.063]  We sent officers to hospitals to be in touch with family members and possible witnesses.
[04:53:58.504 --> 04:54:08.269]  We immediately activated a system of response that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the federal government has in place for these type of incidents.
[04:54:09.730 --> 04:54:13.412]  My first two calls were to the special agent in charge of the FBI.
[04:54:15.033 --> 04:54:21.377]  To the Colonel of the State Police, both Rick Delorea and Tim Albans immediately sent resources.
[04:54:23.378 --> 04:54:29.863]  We have, at this point in time, determined that there has been a third incident that has occurred.
[04:54:31.244 --> 04:54:35.167]  There was an explosion that occurred at the JFK Library.
[04:54:36.087 --> 04:54:38.409]  So this is very much an ongoing event at this point in time.
[04:54:39.595 --> 04:54:43.478]  We are not certain that these incidents are related, but we are treating them as if they are.
[04:54:44.279 --> 04:54:54.225]  We're recommending to people that they stay home, that if they're in hotels in the area that they return to their rooms, and that they don't go anyplace and congregate in large crowds.
[04:54:55.266 --> 04:54:57.648]  We want to make sure we completely stabilize the situation.
[04:54:59.649 --> 04:55:03.712]  We are setting up two telephone numbers that are very important.
[04:55:04.312 --> 04:55:07.855]  The first one is for families of victims and people who are trying to locate people.
[04:55:08.576 --> 04:55:09.677]  That number is 617-635-4500.
[04:55:09.717 --> 04:55:14.942]  That is the mayor's hotline.
[04:55:15.382 --> 04:55:16.983]  Ladies and gentlemen, breaking news.
[04:55:17.824 --> 04:55:18.745]  We'll go to video.
[04:55:18.865 --> 04:55:19.926]  I'm going to come in here in a minute.
[04:55:20.667 --> 04:55:21.647]  Mike Adams is reporting.
[04:55:21.667 --> 04:55:22.969]  He has it linked to the Boston Globe.
[04:55:23.169 --> 04:55:27.092]  Bomb drill this morning, saying prepare for controlled explosions.
[04:55:27.492 --> 04:55:29.234]  That's in case other cops catch them.
[04:55:29.574 --> 04:55:30.675]  They say it's part of the drill.
[04:55:31.096 --> 04:55:34.999]  If this is true, and we're looking at it right now, if this is true, 100%,
[04:55:36.391 --> 04:55:38.132]  Yeah, that's a telltale.
[04:55:38.873 --> 04:55:44.737]  We saw that 9-11, you saw that 7-7 in Britain, and you also saw it in... Oklahoma City.
[04:55:44.998 --> 04:55:45.638]  Yeah, yeah.
[04:55:45.818 --> 04:55:49.961]  And also, even in the shooting that was in Scandinavian country.
[04:55:51.556 --> 04:55:52.577]  Yeah, let's go out to the conference.
[04:55:52.637 --> 04:55:52.697]  Go.
[04:55:52.757 --> 04:55:56.199]  Other agencies who are volunteering to assist us.
[04:55:58.100 --> 04:56:03.223]  After this incident occurred, there were certainly a lot of people who were running from the scene.
[04:56:03.824 --> 04:56:07.066]  Some of them deposited bags and parcels that they were carrying.
[04:56:07.706 --> 04:56:12.349]  Each one of those bags and parcels is being treated as a suspicious device at this point in time.
[04:56:12.789 --> 04:56:16.032]  We have multiple EOD teams that are checking each one of these bags.
[04:56:16.532 --> 04:56:19.374]  But at this point, we have not found another device.
[04:56:20.526 --> 04:56:29.110]  The three incidents that have occurred, two of them occurred simultaneously on Boylston Street, and the third one occurred at JFK about a half hour ago.
[04:56:31.370 --> 04:56:40.874]  People should be calm, but they should understand that this is an ongoing event, and they should understand that we need all the information that we can get available to us.
[04:56:41.955 --> 04:56:42.195]  Thank you.
[04:56:44.569 --> 04:56:45.270]  Thank you very much.
[04:56:45.350 --> 04:56:46.692]  I want to thank the Commissioner.
[04:56:47.253 --> 04:56:51.739]  I had a call from the President about a half an hour ago.
[04:56:51.779 --> 04:56:54.583]  He assured us that we would have a full...
[04:56:56.363 --> 04:57:01.366]  Okay, Mike Adams reporting that there was a bomb drill this morning scheduled in Boston.
[04:57:02.206 --> 04:57:04.187]  Tell us, Jakari, why do they do that every time?
[04:57:04.207 --> 04:57:12.671]  Well, you know, before we came on air, I tried to go to the City of Boston Police Department webpage, you know, to see if they had any kind of drills or anything going on.
[04:57:12.711 --> 04:57:17.614]  No surprise, the website was crashed, I'm sure, by concerned citizens there in the City of Boston.
[04:57:17.634 --> 04:57:19.435]  Same thing with the fire department there.
[04:57:19.895 --> 04:57:22.877]  But, like you said, we've seen it in Oklahoma City, we've seen it in several other
[04:57:24.037 --> 04:57:24.638]  We're good to go.
[04:57:41.136 --> 04:57:41.997]  That's part of it.
[04:57:42.317 --> 04:57:42.717]  Exactly.
[04:57:42.797 --> 04:57:47.520]  So you have people, they're confused as to whether or not it's going on, actually happening or not.
[04:57:48.000 --> 04:57:53.864]  And then, you know, we got guys who may, in normal situations, possibly ignore a...
[04:57:55.370 --> 04:57:57.071]  Do we have new breaking information, Alex?
[04:57:57.251 --> 04:58:04.415]  Mike Adams in T-minus 20 minutes, so continue to monitor globalist operations with photo ops of the troops saving people.
[04:58:04.776 --> 04:58:06.477]  Why are there troops on the streets of America?
[04:58:06.757 --> 04:58:08.378]  Well, now you know why, to save you from the bomb.
[04:58:08.538 --> 04:58:08.758]  Exactly.
[04:58:08.798 --> 04:58:09.658]  But it didn't protect you.
[04:58:09.879 --> 04:58:11.059]  They cannot protect you.
[04:58:11.379 --> 04:58:13.000]  This will make it a total police state.
[04:58:13.261 --> 04:58:15.382]  Go for 20 minutes, then I'm going to come in and give you a 20-minute break.
[04:58:15.402 --> 04:58:20.245]  I'm going to talk to Mike Adams, who found it in the Boston Globe as a cover story.
[04:58:20.645 --> 04:58:23.487]  We're going to be having a terror drill with controlled explosions today.
[04:58:24.267 --> 04:58:27.610]  I mean, this is just now going up at InfoWars.com.
[04:58:27.870 --> 04:58:28.851]  We're going to tweet it right now.
[04:58:29.631 --> 04:58:30.032]  Stand by.
[04:58:31.087 --> 04:58:31.647]  And that's just it.
[04:58:31.708 --> 04:58:40.175]  You know, I mean, as Alex said before, why is it that they want to blame anti-government terrorism on people when they're not hitting the government?
[04:58:40.195 --> 04:58:45.739]  You know, I mean, we've had situations where that tax protester here in Austin flew a plane into the IRS building.
[04:58:45.759 --> 04:58:54.687]  Yeah, on Natural News, the one by Mike Adams, Boston Marathon bombing happened on the same day as controlled explosion drill by Boston bomb squad.
[04:58:54.867 --> 04:58:55.347]  Oh, that's it.
[04:58:55.788 --> 04:58:57.009]  That's it.
[04:58:57.069 --> 04:59:05.456]  That is a definite red flag smoking gun for anybody who is a new viewer or just not familiar with false flag terrorism.
[04:59:05.856 --> 04:59:10.059]  Anytime they run a simulation, as in... They do it every time.
[04:59:10.179 --> 04:59:11.320]  Yeah, almost every time.
[04:59:11.681 --> 04:59:18.746]  They do one of these things, you know, whether it's this Boston thing or Oklahoma City or any number of events, mostly just a couple.
[04:59:19.027 --> 04:59:22.649]  They often run a drill the same day or around the same time.
[04:59:23.831 --> 04:59:27.213]  Well, they're going to use this to try to create a narrative to transform society.
[04:59:27.253 --> 04:59:28.293]  There's no question about that.
[04:59:29.414 --> 04:59:41.801]  But, you know, the other thing when they do these, when they run these drills simultaneously and of the same character, and we also heard this in Britain on the 7-7 bombings on the subway there, people were saying, isn't it amazing?
[04:59:42.081 --> 04:59:46.223]  You know, what a coincidence that we were actually doing a drill at the same time.
[04:59:46.523 --> 04:59:48.104]  Exactly the same scenario.
[04:59:48.144 --> 04:59:48.744]  How about that?
[04:59:48.824 --> 04:59:49.905]  Well, it happens over
[04:59:50.245 --> 04:59:52.406]  And over and over and over again.
[04:59:52.947 --> 04:59:54.788]  And the public just keeps falling for it.
[04:59:55.108 --> 04:59:57.450]  Because it provides cover for them too.
[04:59:57.490 --> 04:59:58.230]  It does two things.
[04:59:58.430 --> 05:00:02.693]  It makes sure that if they're caught, they can always say it was part of the drill.
[05:00:03.013 --> 05:00:03.353]  Right.
[05:00:03.373 --> 05:00:04.174]  So they can back out.
[05:00:04.214 --> 05:00:06.095]  That's, I think, probably the most important thing for them.
[05:00:06.135 --> 05:00:08.097]  It provides them cover so they don't get arrested.
[05:00:08.437 --> 05:00:11.359]  But then it also slows down response to that.
[05:00:11.659 --> 05:00:12.960]  Which also helps them to get away.
[05:00:13.900 --> 05:00:15.521]  But also maximizes the event.
[05:00:16.042 --> 05:00:17.182]  Sure, we can go back to the press conference.
[05:00:17.222 --> 05:00:17.903]  Let's see what they're saying.
[05:00:23.823 --> 05:00:29.911]  We're not being definitive on this right now, but you can you can reach your own conclusions.
[05:00:30.111 --> 05:00:31.493]  Do we know who we're listening to, guys?
[05:00:31.513 --> 05:00:33.235]  This is the police chief taking questions.
[05:00:37.340 --> 05:00:42.022]  Every asset of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the federal government is either here or coming here.
[05:00:43.163 --> 05:00:54.887]  As the governor said, the president has talked directly to the mayor as well as the governor, and I had a personal conversation with the director of the FBI who pledged any help that we needed.
[05:00:54.927 --> 05:00:58.949]  So we are stabilizing the situation at this point in time, but people should be cautious.
[05:00:59.409 --> 05:00:59.769]  That's all.
[05:00:59.809 --> 05:01:00.610]  Thank you all very much.
[05:01:01.810 --> 05:01:02.170]  Thank you.
[05:01:02.411 --> 05:01:02.731]  Thank you.
[05:01:03.311 --> 05:01:06.953]  We're going to try to do a next briefing at 7 o'clock, so it'll be two hours.
[05:01:06.973 --> 05:01:07.154]  Okay.
[05:01:07.194 --> 05:01:10.195]  So when Alex goes on live, they'll have their next briefing.
[05:01:10.215 --> 05:01:11.236]  Well, actually, maybe before that.
[05:01:11.256 --> 05:01:12.297]  They're on a different time zone.
[05:01:12.337 --> 05:01:12.937]  Yeah.
[05:01:12.977 --> 05:01:14.618]  Well, that would be 6 our time.
[05:01:14.658 --> 05:01:15.579]  He's going to be on before that.
[05:01:16.909 --> 05:01:17.949]  But I tell you, it's the same thing.
[05:01:17.989 --> 05:01:20.850]  You know, as I say, fool me once, fool me twice, shame on me.
[05:01:20.870 --> 05:01:30.752]  And I tell you what, it's been not twice that they have used this scenario of having a drill going on that is exactly the same thing as the attack.
[05:01:30.952 --> 05:01:31.272]  Exactly.
[05:01:31.292 --> 05:01:37.794]  And I definitely want to point out, when we say things that, you know, the bomb squad just happened to be in the area, we're not saying that necessarily you're
[05:01:38.514 --> 05:01:42.117]  Average cop, your good time guy is, you know, a bad guy.
[05:01:42.197 --> 05:01:43.158]  Oh, that's right, that's right.
[05:01:43.178 --> 05:01:51.184]  People always say, you guys blame the firefighters and you blame the police and I'm not saying that, you know, some guy on the SWAT team was planning to blow anything up.
[05:01:51.224 --> 05:01:53.546]  He was told to be there as assigned his orders.
[05:01:53.726 --> 05:01:58.710]  Actually, if you look at the noble law, you'll see that there were some honest cops who reported what they saw and they got killed.
[05:01:59.170 --> 05:01:59.970]  Yeah, Terrence Yankee.
[05:02:00.170 --> 05:02:14.235]  He was near the site of the Oklahoma City bombing and I believe he was filling out a traffic ticket at the time, dropped what he was doing to run out to the Murrah building and rescued a couple people and I guess he saw a few things that he wasn't supposed to see.
[05:02:14.255 --> 05:02:17.576]  Well, it's called compartmentalization and it's something that goes back, I mean...
[05:02:18.636 --> 05:02:19.637]  People doubt that happens.
[05:02:19.677 --> 05:02:24.421]  I mean, look at the Manhattan Project, which is probably the most obvious example of that, and the largest scale of that.
[05:02:24.702 --> 05:02:35.051]  Very few people knew what that was really about, and yet it involved thousands upon thousands of people who are actually supporting that, and they really had no idea what they were doing.
[05:02:35.511 --> 05:02:38.294]  And a lot of these first responders, I'm sure, don't know what they're doing.
[05:02:38.574 --> 05:02:43.619]  It only takes a few people who are pulling something off like this, but the telltale sign that's there
[05:02:44.239 --> 05:02:45.040]  We're good to go.
[05:03:03.797 --> 05:03:11.566]  And it makes me concerned because I believe we have a total of five bombs that we know of as of yet, and not everyone exploded.
[05:03:11.606 --> 05:03:17.072]  And you see this many times, just go back to the Oklahoma City bombing, there were bombs found inside the building that never detonated.
[05:03:17.513 --> 05:03:19.876]  So it does concern me, are there more bombs out there?
[05:03:20.436 --> 05:03:27.441]  You know, regardless of whether this was a planned deal or, you know, just some kind of lone nut or whatever the case may be.
[05:03:27.481 --> 05:03:27.882]  We'll wait.
[05:03:28.122 --> 05:03:30.484]  Definitely interested to see what Mike Adams has to say.
[05:03:30.544 --> 05:03:32.385]  But how many more bombs are out there?
[05:03:32.445 --> 05:03:33.686]  And I'm not doing that to fearmonger.
[05:03:33.706 --> 05:03:36.088]  It just, you know, really concerns me for the people in that area.
[05:03:36.188 --> 05:03:36.368]  Yeah.
[05:03:36.648 --> 05:03:36.809]  Yeah.
[05:03:36.909 --> 05:03:44.754]  And there were a lot of allegations in the Iraq War and Afghanistan that our military was doing stage bombs.
[05:03:44.835 --> 05:03:46.456]  Karzai made those accusations.
[05:03:46.476 --> 05:03:47.256]  So, I mean,
[05:03:48.237 --> 05:04:07.362]  The thing is, you know, terrorism can be state terrorism, it can be individual terrorism, and, uh, but, you know, even for the people who want to give them the benefit of the doubt and say, even though there was another staged drill that was exactly the same scenario, just like we saw in 9-11, just like we saw, uh, another, every one of these other transformational events,
[05:04:07.982 --> 05:04:09.462]  Okay, go with the official narrative.
[05:04:09.622 --> 05:04:16.804]  We still have to look at this and not allow them to transform society in the vain hope that they're going to somehow keep us free.
[05:04:17.084 --> 05:04:17.304]  Right.
[05:04:17.664 --> 05:04:18.745]  It has now begun.
[05:04:19.145 --> 05:04:23.026]  They're now saying on CNN, they're looking at right-wing extremist groups.
[05:04:23.506 --> 05:04:24.506]  Oh, they've been looking at them.
[05:04:24.546 --> 05:04:27.247]  And Salon is attacking me for saying they would do this.
[05:04:27.687 --> 05:04:27.827]  Exactly.
[05:04:27.847 --> 05:04:29.927]  And I'll be more wrong because I'm right.
[05:04:30.468 --> 05:04:31.268]  Yeah, yeah.
[05:04:32.308 --> 05:04:37.492]  Yeah, we've seen them target militia groups and patriots and people such as that.
[05:04:37.532 --> 05:04:48.460]  I did a report a few weeks ago, I don't know, maybe if we have time to dig it out, maybe Rob Duke can find it, where we talk about how the TV show The Following demonizes patriots and people in militia.
[05:04:48.480 --> 05:04:49.641]  Oh, I forgot about that!
[05:04:49.881 --> 05:04:50.922]  They're getting everybody primed!
[05:04:51.542 --> 05:05:00.150]  Yeah, and I did a report that they even had a Green Lantern fighting militiamen and people who were concerned about government overreach and all that.
[05:05:00.550 --> 05:05:03.252]  Well, going back, they had Captain America taking on the Tea Party.
[05:05:03.292 --> 05:05:03.933]  Yeah, Captain America.
[05:05:03.953 --> 05:05:06.355]  Remember that a few years ago when the Tea Party was coming up?
[05:05:06.515 --> 05:05:07.436]  And all kinds of things.
[05:05:07.496 --> 05:05:11.179]  So it's nothing new, and they've been getting you ready for it for some time.
[05:05:11.459 --> 05:05:14.602]  Well, I'll tell you what, that's really, really amazing that they were at all.
[05:05:15.503 --> 05:05:23.329]  And this is all speculation at this point, but we talk about your returning veterans, your tea partiers, your people just concerned about government overreach.
[05:05:23.389 --> 05:05:27.031]  I remember the recent Tom Cruise movie, Jack Reacher.
[05:05:27.471 --> 05:05:28.512]  It had a sniper.
[05:05:28.532 --> 05:05:30.754]  Now, this is, of course, a different situation.
[05:05:30.774 --> 05:05:31.995]  This is a sniper in the film.
[05:05:32.815 --> 05:05:44.059]  And, you know, they're framing this guy up, oh, he's, you know, this wicked returning veteran, and, oh, we can't trust the veterans, and anybody who, you know, is concerned about the Constitution is some extremist, some terrorist.
[05:05:44.539 --> 05:05:50.140]  You know, we seem to see this narrative rolled out over and over again, and it would not surprise me at all.
[05:05:50.961 --> 05:05:51.941]  Okay, we'll take a look at this.
[05:05:53.328 --> 05:05:59.430]  CNN analyst Peter Bergen bombing in Boston were likely right-wingers.
[05:05:59.850 --> 05:06:11.094]  Well, Peter Bergen had an editorial out for CNN not even two weeks ago where he was coming after the right-wingers and saying, you know, we don't need to worry about Islamists anymore.
[05:06:11.134 --> 05:06:13.095]  Now we need to worry about the right-wingers, you know.
[05:06:13.615 --> 05:06:15.256]  So he's been after that for a while.
[05:06:17.648 --> 05:06:21.913]  There we go, up on the screen we got a Captain America versus the Tea Party comic.
[05:06:22.414 --> 05:06:31.946]  Yes, if you are listening on the radio you can go to InfoWars.com forward slash listen and you can see all the things that we are putting up on the screen.
[05:06:32.326 --> 05:06:33.968]  So yeah, I mean it's comic books
[05:06:34.088 --> 05:06:36.990]  It's movies, it's TV shows, it's everything.
[05:06:51.901 --> 05:06:55.625]  Well, they blame the Boston bombings on right-wing extremists.
[05:06:56.426 --> 05:07:02.533]  I would not be surprised, because we've seen that returning veterans and quote, right-wingers are the new terrorist threat.
[05:07:02.813 --> 05:07:11.563]  It's no longer Al-Qaeda, you know, it's guys like Alex Siss and John Deere hats and guys who have tractors and got a few acres and like to shoot their machine guns out in the backyard.
[05:07:12.023 --> 05:07:17.348]  And we got Bill Maher just last couple of days coming out and saying, you know, we got to get rid of the Second Amendment.
[05:07:17.388 --> 05:07:28.619]  I don't get these guys, especially a guy like Bill Maher, since you brought him up, a guy who so adamantly wants his First Amendment, freedom of speech, but, you know, Second Amendment is, you know, BS as he called it.
[05:07:29.119 --> 05:07:35.504]  And just these guys, they don't understand that this whole Bill of Rights has protected them, not just the thing that they hold the most dear.
[05:07:35.544 --> 05:07:37.765]  Every single one of them was about individual rights.
[05:07:37.785 --> 05:07:42.348]  This is the problem with the gun debate, is that it's a constant center-right debate.
[05:07:42.388 --> 05:07:44.029]  There's no left in this debate.
[05:07:44.109 --> 05:07:50.974]  Everyone on the left is so afraid to say what should be said, which is the Second Amendment is bull... Why doesn't anyone go...
[05:07:52.435 --> 05:07:54.557]  I don't know Bill Maher, I don't know his situation.
[05:07:54.757 --> 05:07:59.342]  I'd be surprised if either one, he doesn't have armed bodyguards, he lives in some type of gated community.
[05:07:59.662 --> 05:08:02.925]  Well, it simply isn't true that the left is being silent in this debate.
[05:08:03.045 --> 05:08:04.907]  They are the ones who are driving this debate.
[05:08:04.987 --> 05:08:05.407]  No, definitely.
[05:08:05.427 --> 05:08:09.991]  If you're going to be reasonable, let's look at the situation that, you know what, this country had far
[05:08:10.732 --> 05:08:11.313]  I don't
[05:08:26.713 --> 05:08:27.473]  Okay, they've just gone up.
[05:08:28.714 --> 05:08:33.816]  Okay, it's now six people have died and 46... Critically, critically... Critically injured, okay.
[05:08:33.996 --> 05:08:34.916]  Six critically injured.
[05:08:34.956 --> 05:08:37.937]  Okay, so we're still trying to make sense out of all these numbers.
[05:08:37.977 --> 05:08:41.838]  We keep getting numbers from different sources, but that was our most recent tally.
[05:08:41.959 --> 05:08:42.919]  Yeah, yeah.
[05:08:43.553 --> 05:08:51.456]  But, going back in history, I mean, you can look at situations where, like I said before, when there were no gun regulations whatsoever, there was far less violence.
[05:08:51.916 --> 05:08:55.058]  The violence is not being driven by people having access to guns.
[05:08:55.138 --> 05:08:57.139]  Actually, the crime rate goes down, as we've shown.
[05:08:58.399 --> 05:09:00.420]  Things that are driving it are things like the war on drugs.
[05:09:00.820 --> 05:09:05.224]  And you used to be able to go in and buy, you know, soda pop that had cocaine in it.
[05:09:05.244 --> 05:09:07.226]  That's why they called it Coca-Cola, right?
[05:09:07.686 --> 05:09:11.109]  And we didn't have the gang violence that we've got now because they were on drugs.
[05:09:11.129 --> 05:09:15.833]  If you're watching at Infowars.com forward slash listen, you can see some FBI crime statistics.
[05:09:15.853 --> 05:09:17.835]  But please go ahead, David, you're talking about Coca-Cola.
[05:09:17.975 --> 05:09:18.575]  Yeah, absolutely.
[05:09:18.615 --> 05:09:24.801]  This, you know, as Alex has said before, you know, crime rates plummeting over the last 20 years and yet they don't want to talk about that.
[05:09:24.881 --> 05:09:25.781]  And they don't want to talk about that.
[05:09:25.801 --> 05:09:26.382]  That's why the left is silent.
[05:09:26.522 --> 05:09:34.585]  Because when we went out to this recent anti-gun rally or gun restriction rally, we talked to some people and they kept bringing up the topic.
[05:09:34.785 --> 05:09:39.386]  I believe Chief Acevedo himself brought it up, talking about the crime statistics in Chicago.
[05:09:39.686 --> 05:09:46.649]  And he comes out there and he says, everybody brings up the fact that gun violence is so high in Chicago and they have less guns.
[05:09:46.689 --> 05:09:48.589]  And we're like, yeah, that's true.
[05:09:48.930 --> 05:09:51.671]  And he says that's because they're getting their guns from other areas.
[05:09:51.971 --> 05:09:53.111]  Like his place.
[05:09:53.211 --> 05:09:53.971]  Yeah.
[05:09:54.431 --> 05:09:55.912]  So by that logic, and I believe we talked
[05:09:56.052 --> 05:09:58.674]  We touched on this last week when we were in here with Alex.
[05:09:59.514 --> 05:10:06.019]  Shouldn't the state of Texas, or at least a city in Texas, have similar numbers as far as gun violence as Chicago?
[05:10:06.219 --> 05:10:16.667]  If the cause of gun violence is easy access to guns, then the places like Texas where you have the easier access to guns ought to have the same crime rate as Chicago.
[05:10:16.707 --> 05:10:21.650]  But the thing that's driving it, as we also had when we were here with Alex, we had a former
[05:10:22.551 --> 05:10:33.615]  He's a prosecutor from Cook County, Chicago, and he was quoting the chief of police in Chicago saying that 80% of the gun violence in Chicago was because of the war on drugs.
[05:10:33.655 --> 05:10:42.458]  It's just like it was when Al Capone was riding up and down the streets of Chicago and shooting people with fully automatic machine guns out of the Model Ts and that sort of thing.
[05:10:43.239 --> 05:10:46.560]  It's driven by prohibition, and if you're going to prohibit guns,
[05:10:46.980 --> 05:10:58.464]  You're going to see that guns are going to go up in potency, just like alcohol did during Prohibition, just like illegal, like marijuana and cocaine and you have new drugs that are created like meth.
[05:10:58.824 --> 05:11:01.685]  You're going to see that happening with Prohibition too, but you're going to see it with guns.
[05:11:01.965 --> 05:11:02.125]  Right.
[05:11:02.925 --> 05:11:04.526]  We have now screenshotted it.
[05:11:05.566 --> 05:11:08.907]  There isn't just the drill Mike Adams talked about that was going on during and after.
[05:11:09.427 --> 05:11:14.589]  There was earlier drills and bomb sniffing dogs right before the explosion they were over there.
[05:11:16.022 --> 05:11:18.984]  And the bomb sniffing dogs didn't pick up the bombs in the air?
[05:11:19.444 --> 05:11:20.585]  They were there probably placing them.
[05:11:21.646 --> 05:11:22.606]  I know that's how it always is.
[05:11:22.747 --> 05:11:25.208]  In Madrid, remember the Madrid bombings?
[05:11:25.268 --> 05:11:26.249]  It even came out in their news.
[05:11:26.289 --> 05:11:27.470]  The government got removed.
[05:11:27.730 --> 05:11:29.291]  The Spanish got to know what they're doing.
[05:11:30.151 --> 05:11:32.153]  The government got caught doing the Madrid deal.
[05:11:33.454 --> 05:11:34.194]  That was back on 3-3-3.
[05:11:34.214 --> 05:11:37.056]  So everybody needs to intel that data.
[05:11:37.496 --> 05:11:39.738]  I mean, did they run a playbook, man?
[05:11:41.039 --> 05:11:44.661]  Well, we know Gladio, I mean the whole purpose of Gladio was to try to manipulate
[05:11:45.282 --> 05:11:45.542]  That's right.
[05:12:00.760 --> 05:12:01.560]  Very much real.
[05:12:01.900 --> 05:12:02.861]  Yeah.
[05:12:02.921 --> 05:12:07.743]  Because every time it's a bombing or a shooting, it's these right-wingers.
[05:12:07.783 --> 05:12:08.983]  You know, that's the new thing.
[05:12:09.023 --> 05:12:10.564]  And then a right-winger's not even a right-winger.
[05:12:10.584 --> 05:12:11.504]  It's somebody that loves liberty.
[05:12:11.884 --> 05:12:12.204]  That's right.
[05:12:12.284 --> 05:12:14.765]  I mean, how obvious is the demonization on TV?
[05:12:14.885 --> 05:12:15.606]  I'm getting out of here.
[05:12:15.846 --> 05:12:17.386]  We're going to get Mike Adams on in about 10 minutes.
[05:12:17.406 --> 05:12:18.227]  You guys keep going.
[05:12:20.247 --> 05:12:21.228]  I told you guys.
[05:12:21.268 --> 05:12:22.548]  Have I not been saying lately?
[05:12:22.568 --> 05:12:22.808]  Get ready.
[05:12:22.828 --> 05:12:23.409]  He's been saying it.
[05:12:23.469 --> 05:12:24.109]  Oh, yeah.
[05:12:24.129 --> 05:12:26.190]  He said the same thing around Sandy Hook.
[05:12:26.770 --> 05:12:26.990]  You know?
[05:12:27.947 --> 05:12:34.191]  Well, let's be clear, this is a long-term plan, and quite frankly, this has been going back... But it's sick to know they're doing it, didn't they?
[05:12:34.311 --> 05:12:35.132]  It's so sick!
[05:12:35.472 --> 05:12:35.992]  Right, right.
[05:12:36.352 --> 05:12:38.374]  But I mean, if you go back, even looking at the U.N.
[05:12:38.434 --> 05:12:39.655]  Arms Trade Treaty, right?
[05:12:39.755 --> 05:12:43.797]  That has been about... that went back... Fast and Furious is laying the groundwork for that.
[05:12:43.917 --> 05:12:48.240]  It's about... And by the way, Salon, again, said I was full of crap for saying they'd blame us.
[05:12:48.800 --> 05:12:50.742]  CNN, now MediaLite's got it.
[05:12:50.782 --> 05:12:51.702]  They're saying, you know, right?
[05:12:51.722 --> 05:12:53.984]  Can we pull up that article, that Salon article?
[05:12:54.264 --> 05:12:54.784]  Do we have that?
[05:12:55.685 --> 05:12:56.906]  Okay, they'll get it here in a second.
[05:12:57.912 --> 05:12:59.293]  Well, I didn't know we were right-wingers.
[05:12:59.814 --> 05:13:02.816]  Yeah, anybody who cares about liberty, just like Alex said.
[05:13:03.377 --> 05:13:07.620]  I mean, if you care about your liberty, if you want your Second Amendment, if you want your First Amendment, if you want any of it.
[05:13:08.000 --> 05:13:11.623]  Well, if you talk about the Constitution, then you're labeled a right-winger.
[05:13:11.704 --> 05:13:19.050]  I don't know when that became the exclusive concern of right-wingers, because there are a lot of people on the left that care about civil liberties and things like that.
[05:13:19.090 --> 05:13:20.271]  I guess, you know, if they
[05:13:21.171 --> 05:13:38.728]  A lot of people on the left, though, have a blind spot about guns because I think it's just a cultural thing, you know, just like there's a lot of people... I think it very much is a cultural thing because you have people, you know, maybe the higher crime cities such as Chicago, New York, or whatever, and they think about a gun as, you know, the thing that killed their friend last week.
[05:13:39.148 --> 05:13:42.974]  As opposed to here, you know, southern states, southwest, whatever you want to call it.
[05:13:43.194 --> 05:13:47.480]  You got people that grow up hunting and fishing and they go target shooting with their dad on weekends.
[05:13:47.820 --> 05:13:55.410]  Well, you know, Jakari, just before that IndyGun rally that was at the Austin Capitol last weekend, or weekend, two weekends ago actually now.
[05:13:56.206 --> 05:14:00.467]  There was, I got there a little bit early, and there was a marijuana legalization rally before that.
[05:14:00.707 --> 05:14:15.772]  And the thing that struck me was, when this lady, who was obviously coming from a leftist type of culture and everything, was talking to people, she said, understand that the people that you're talking to about legalizing marijuana, they think that they're protecting their kids when they make marijuana illegal.
[05:14:16.253 --> 05:14:17.553]  And of course, that doesn't
[05:14:18.354 --> 05:14:20.076]  Do anything to protect their kids, right?
[05:14:20.096 --> 05:14:20.136]  No.
[05:14:20.376 --> 05:14:24.119]  All it does is mean that people who have chronic health conditions can't get marijuana.
[05:14:24.980 --> 05:14:34.249]  It means that we've got prisons that are bursting at the seam and even people who don't engage in these drugs are paying for it with their tax money and with their freedoms.
[05:14:34.529 --> 05:14:34.789]  Exactly.
[05:14:34.809 --> 05:14:41.075]  Because it's being used, you know, the state of the art in terms of taking people's freedom before the war on terror was the war on drugs.
[05:14:41.235 --> 05:14:54.663]  And as somebody that doesn't use drugs, that's why I'm so anti-prohibition, is because I saw the war on drugs as a tool that was used to take my freedoms, take my money, and I didn't need to have a prohibition to keep me off of drugs.
[05:14:55.364 --> 05:15:07.371]  If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[05:15:08.223 --> 05:15:09.864]  Yeah, and that's what it is.
[05:15:09.924 --> 05:15:13.547]  I mean, because very few will admit that on camera on TV.
[05:15:14.207 --> 05:15:15.768]  But I mean, she did.
[05:15:16.028 --> 05:15:18.370]  Mark Martinez did here in Austin.
[05:15:18.490 --> 05:15:20.171]  And that's some people's ultimate goal.
[05:15:20.211 --> 05:15:29.437]  But going back to prohibition, like you said, people have this idea that if something becomes if they want to outlaw or make something legal and everybody's going to have it.
[05:15:29.457 --> 05:15:30.378]  Well, think about it right now.
[05:15:30.918 --> 05:15:31.779]  Talking about guns.
[05:15:31.879 --> 05:15:33.020]  I mean, guns are legal right now.
[05:15:33.040 --> 05:15:33.920]  Not everybody has them.
[05:15:34.280 --> 05:15:35.601]  Alcohol is legal right now.
[05:15:35.621 --> 05:15:36.542]  Not everybody drinks.
[05:15:37.122 --> 05:15:37.963]  And I'm not a
[05:15:38.483 --> 05:15:40.264]  Hey, how you doing guys?
[05:16:08.442 --> 05:16:11.003]  So Dan, how difficult was it for you to get there?
[05:16:11.023 --> 05:16:12.064]  How far did you have to travel?
[05:16:31.810 --> 05:16:33.151]  They say a lot of police everywhere?
[05:16:33.171 --> 05:16:34.132]  How about the military?
[05:16:34.172 --> 05:16:35.854]  Now do they keep you at a distance?
[05:16:35.894 --> 05:16:36.915]  How close were you able to get?
[05:16:52.399 --> 05:17:04.325]  I got into an area for all the press to go into and they questioned who I was and checked my credentials and apparently it's blocked off where the medical tents are and all the EMTs are in a lot over there.
[05:17:05.646 --> 05:17:05.886]  Okay.
[05:17:06.606 --> 05:17:07.867]  So you said you're getting footage.
[05:17:07.887 --> 05:17:10.048]  Have you had a chance to talk to any eyewitnesses yet?
[05:17:11.048 --> 05:17:11.689]  Not at the moment.
[05:17:11.709 --> 05:17:18.252]  I just wanted to race to the site first and get some footage and see what was going on and get an assessment of the situation and signs of human people.
[05:17:19.571 --> 05:17:20.111]  Good, good.
[05:17:21.212 --> 05:17:23.034]  Well, Dan, definitely be safe out there.
[05:17:23.714 --> 05:17:26.456]  Do you have any concerns that there may still be live bombs out there?
[05:17:26.476 --> 05:17:28.858]  Oh, absolutely, because I'm on the way out.
[05:17:28.878 --> 05:17:34.102]  We're listening to local talk show radios, radio talk show hosts, and they're saying there was two more bombs dropped.
[05:17:34.142 --> 05:17:37.124]  That's a total of three so far, and they don't know if there's more.
[05:17:37.464 --> 05:17:39.046]  Well, we heard there's a total of five.
[05:17:39.086 --> 05:17:40.927]  Maybe you got different information than we do.
[05:17:40.947 --> 05:17:43.689]  Well, that's counting three unexploded and two exploded.
[05:17:43.749 --> 05:17:43.989]  Yeah.
[05:17:44.009 --> 05:17:44.830]  Maybe that's what the five is.
[05:17:44.850 --> 05:17:48.172]  Yeah, three unexploded, two exploded, and there could be a lot more, too.
[05:17:49.679 --> 05:17:55.600]  Any word from the local people there about what these unexploded bombs are like?
[05:17:55.640 --> 05:17:56.900]  Are they saying they're homemade?
[05:17:56.920 --> 05:17:59.941]  Yes, they're saying they're homemade bombs.
[05:18:00.001 --> 05:18:05.462]  They're not accessing the territory yet, or from the United States or from another country.
[05:18:05.922 --> 05:18:09.363]  They're doing an investigation now, but they do confirm that they are homemade bombs.
[05:18:10.023 --> 05:18:15.604]  Do you, you may not be a whiz at this, but do you smell any particular chemical or agent used?
[05:18:16.943 --> 05:18:18.143]  Well, no, not so far.
[05:18:18.564 --> 05:18:21.925]  I mean, right now, I just smell a bunch of food over here from all these restaurants.
[05:18:22.285 --> 05:18:24.746]  Right now, it's pretty chaotic.
[05:18:24.926 --> 05:18:27.427]  I mean, I got at least 80 rescues.
[05:18:27.967 --> 05:18:29.368]  80 ambulances, I should say.
[05:18:29.388 --> 05:18:33.809]  They call them rescues around, but we got about 80 ambulances around here, at least.
[05:18:34.049 --> 05:18:36.170]  And now we got an internal area.
[05:18:36.210 --> 05:18:38.251]  Now we're moving here to Ground Zero.
[05:18:38.411 --> 05:18:40.852]  I mean, it looks like a massive epidemic just hit.
[05:18:41.778 --> 05:18:42.018]  Wow.
[05:18:42.459 --> 05:18:45.103]  So how congregated is the area?
[05:18:45.143 --> 05:18:47.166]  Have people cleared out or are they still hanging around?
[05:18:48.194 --> 05:18:54.859]  Um, there's a lot of people still hanging around, but, um, we're all trying to, uh, you know, the restricted areas, um, nobody's allowed.
[05:18:54.939 --> 05:18:57.641]  I mean, up near the city, there's a lot of people still here.
[05:18:57.661 --> 05:19:01.183]  You know, a lot of Marathon runners are still coming in, and all that stuff.
[05:19:01.263 --> 05:19:09.609]  I mean, like, right now, I'm in the, uh, restricted area for press only, and, uh, and, you know, it looks like a lot of people standing out there, you know, waiting for information, too.
[05:19:09.629 --> 05:19:10.230]  It's going on.
[05:19:10.250 --> 05:19:14.393]  A lot of, uh, you know, runners are still here, and their families gathering information.
[05:19:14.933 --> 05:19:17.434]  Yeah, see if you can talk to somebody that was eyewitness.
[05:19:35.111 --> 05:19:35.671]  And I definitely will.
[05:19:35.711 --> 05:19:39.833]  I'm going to get some interviews, some eyewitness interviews, hopefully from the officials here.
[05:19:39.853 --> 05:19:42.013]  There's supposed to be a press conference tonight.
[05:19:42.134 --> 05:19:42.714]  Where and when?
[05:19:42.774 --> 05:19:43.714]  I have no clue yet.
[05:19:43.774 --> 05:19:46.035]  And I'm going to try to make that an official press conference.
[05:19:46.615 --> 05:19:47.756]  We have until 7 p.m.
[05:19:47.776 --> 05:19:48.276]  your time.
[05:19:48.296 --> 05:19:50.176]  I'm not exactly sure.
[05:19:50.396 --> 05:19:51.397]  I'm not exactly sure where it is.
[05:19:52.446 --> 05:20:06.149]  I don't know, Dan, if you've heard, but Mike Adams has confirmed by looking in the Boston paper that they were running a bomb drill today, earlier, and they actually had bomb-sniffing dogs and bomb squad at that location earlier, before the bombs went off.
[05:20:06.469 --> 05:20:07.529]  Have you heard anything about that?
[05:20:08.189 --> 05:20:08.749]  Unbelievable.
[05:20:08.769 --> 05:20:12.130]  Do we know what newspaper that is so we can have Dan get one?
[05:20:12.490 --> 05:20:15.931]  Guys in the... Does anybody know which newspaper he found that in?
[05:20:20.089 --> 05:20:22.271]  We're trying to find out which newspaper that was in.
[05:20:22.992 --> 05:20:27.176]  We're going to be having Mike Adams on in just a few minutes, and he's going to go into detail on that, but I'm not sure.
[05:20:27.196 --> 05:20:29.578]  It was the Boston Globe.
[05:20:29.698 --> 05:20:33.222]  So, Darren, if you can pick up a copy of the Boston Globe, that'd be great.
[05:20:33.362 --> 05:20:34.143]  Grab a bunch of them.
[05:20:34.563 --> 05:20:34.723]  Yeah.
[05:20:35.965 --> 05:20:37.346]  Yeah, that's going to be a collector's item.
[05:20:38.107 --> 05:20:38.267]  Yeah.
[05:20:41.035 --> 05:20:43.896]  Well, see if you can get the Boston Globe.
[05:20:43.996 --> 05:20:50.619]  It may have just been on the online version of the Boston Globe, but see if you can find the printed paper as well.
[05:20:50.679 --> 05:20:52.680]  Alright, well stay safe out there, Dan.
[05:20:52.700 --> 05:20:54.981]  Alright, take care, Dan.
[05:20:55.001 --> 05:20:55.201]  Bye-bye.
[05:21:10.495 --> 05:21:12.978]  That's our own Dan Badondi on location in Boston.
[05:21:13.559 --> 05:21:14.480]  Yeah, guys, everywhere.
[05:21:14.620 --> 05:21:15.901]  Got there quickly from Rhode Island.
[05:21:16.182 --> 05:21:18.745]  I guess he said it took him about an hour, pretty heavy traffic or something.
[05:21:18.865 --> 05:21:19.726]  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
[05:21:20.286 --> 05:21:21.648]  But I had no doubt he was gonna get there.
[05:21:21.688 --> 05:21:25.533]  So in the meantime, I believe we have Mike Adams coming up in about 10 minutes or so.
[05:21:26.433 --> 05:21:29.195]  To discuss his discovery in the Boston Globe.
[05:21:29.255 --> 05:21:34.297]  And like I said, we're trying to get Dan Badandi, our correspondent, on scene to get a paper so we can actually confirm it.
[05:21:34.337 --> 05:21:36.639]  If it is in the paper, it may just be in the online edition.
[05:21:36.759 --> 05:21:39.500]  Yeah, I would think it'd only be in the online edition, you know, as I think about it.
[05:21:39.540 --> 05:21:44.363]  Because if that happened this morning, they wouldn't have printed a paper before then, probably.
[05:21:47.749 --> 05:21:50.630]  So, we got a few more minutes before we get to break.
[05:21:50.990 --> 05:21:54.992]  So, just my thought when I was talking to him, I should have asked him while he was out there.
[05:21:55.852 --> 05:21:58.433]  The reports are telling people to stay in their homes.
[05:21:58.733 --> 05:22:01.714]  I heard a report earlier on Fox Boston.
[05:22:01.734 --> 05:22:04.355]  They were telling college kids to stay at the dorm.
[05:22:05.075 --> 05:22:06.456]  So, let me ask you this, David.
[05:22:06.496 --> 05:22:11.098]  Let's say you have some kids in Boston and they're telling them to stay at the dorm or stay wherever.
[05:22:11.138 --> 05:22:12.158]  Do you feel safe with that?
[05:22:13.120 --> 05:22:13.540]  Yeah, I know.
[05:22:13.600 --> 05:22:17.163]  That's a different situation than it is if there's a shooter or something, isn't it?
[05:22:17.323 --> 05:22:19.365]  I mean, you know, I don't know.
[05:22:19.605 --> 05:22:20.386]  I don't know what I would do.
[05:22:20.886 --> 05:22:23.128]  Yeah, that's the thing I've been trying to wrap my head around.
[05:22:23.288 --> 05:22:24.089]  Do you try to run?
[05:22:24.109 --> 05:22:25.330]  Do you stay there?
[05:22:25.350 --> 05:22:29.433]  I mean, because you have the traffic and all kinds of other issues to go about.
[05:22:30.094 --> 05:22:31.655]  I guess it would depend on what kind of bomb.
[05:22:31.695 --> 05:22:37.420]  I mean, if they thought it was a nuclear bomb or some kind of a biological or chemical thing, yeah, I would try to get away.
[05:22:37.460 --> 05:22:40.142]  But if it was one of these type of bombs, I'd probably just stay where I was.
[05:22:40.802 --> 05:22:45.645]  Yeah, and so far it's saying it has the appearance of a homemade device.
[05:22:47.166 --> 05:23:02.756]  Even if this is, and all indications appear to be, a false flag, because as we said before, when the government does a drill in exactly the same place, using exactly the same techniques, at exactly the same day and time that the other thing is going off, it is a false flag.
[05:23:02.876 --> 05:23:03.056]  Right.
[05:23:05.618 --> 05:23:10.680]  You know, of course they're not going to do a bomb that looks like it came from the U.S.
[05:23:10.700 --> 05:23:11.500]  military or something.
[05:23:11.600 --> 05:23:13.660]  Right, it's not going to have Marines stamped on the side.
[05:23:13.681 --> 05:23:14.661]  They're not that incompetent.
[05:23:15.161 --> 05:23:17.002]  They will do the same M.O.
[05:23:17.182 --> 05:23:19.522]  over and over again because nobody pays any attention to that.
[05:23:20.082 --> 05:23:23.043]  You know, even though we yell and scream about it, nobody pays.
[05:23:23.063 --> 05:23:28.105]  You're not going to see Salon or CNN cover the fact that they had a bomb drill.
[05:23:28.425 --> 05:23:28.605]  No.
[05:23:28.665 --> 05:23:30.147]  They're not going to talk about that at all.
[05:23:30.487 --> 05:23:30.687]  No.
[05:23:30.767 --> 05:23:41.477]  Whenever that comes up, like it did in the 7-7 bombs in London, whenever that comes up on the air, it's always, oh wow, isn't that an amazing coincidence, type of thing, and change the subject.
[05:23:41.717 --> 05:23:43.439]  And then they never revisit it again.
[05:23:43.499 --> 05:23:54.869]  The last line in the article, and there it is, Salon on the screen, if you're listening on the radio, go to Infowars.com forward slash listen, but Alex Jones, Boston explosion, a government conspiracy.
[05:23:55.029 --> 05:24:00.593]  Well you can add our names to that because I think with this bomb drill information I think it's a government conspiracy.
[05:24:00.613 --> 05:24:02.414]  Can we zoom in a little bit so I can see the tagline on there?
[05:24:02.434 --> 05:24:05.537]  It says Alex Jones something.
[05:24:06.465 --> 05:24:11.989]  Okay, Alex Jones and the French see false flag that will be blamed on the Tea Party.
[05:24:12.029 --> 05:24:14.271]  Okay, let's see if it is blamed on the Tea Party.
[05:24:14.851 --> 05:24:17.033]  Yeah, and expand the TSA's reach.
[05:24:17.053 --> 05:24:19.534]  Let's see if it does expand TSA's reach.
[05:24:19.634 --> 05:24:21.736]  Let's see if it does either one of those things.
[05:24:21.996 --> 05:24:25.559]  And like Alex said, because he saw this coming and pointed it out, he's evil.
[05:24:25.599 --> 05:24:27.140]  But you know, it doesn't take
[05:24:28.470 --> 05:24:44.575]  Some kind of Cassandra Powers to see this kind of stuff coming when we're getting virtually a day every day we're getting another release from the War College at West Point or we're getting another Army Lieutenant Colonel coming out and saying you know the bad guys are people who talk about the Constitution.
[05:24:44.915 --> 05:24:57.499]  The bad guys who are the people who think the government needs to be limited in some way you know I mean the bad guys are Christians you know when when that is coming out from another you know one source after the other
[05:24:57.819 --> 05:24:58.059]  Right.
[05:24:58.659 --> 05:25:07.142]  On almost a daily basis in the last, you know, couple weeks, you know, you can pretty much see something like this coming, you know, and that's what Alex is doing.
[05:25:07.162 --> 05:25:15.304]  He's just looking at the news and saying, you know what, they're building a narrative, like Jesse Ventura said, first they assassinate your character, then they assassinate you.
[05:25:15.684 --> 05:25:21.026]  They want to move against people who want limited government because they want unlimited government.
[05:25:21.406 --> 05:25:26.648]  They want to demonize people who want the Constitution because they want to rule as dictators and so they're building that narrative up.
[05:25:26.889 --> 05:25:32.611]  Homeschoolers, because if you have your child at home, they can't indoctrinate your child eight plus hours a day.
[05:25:32.771 --> 05:25:33.612]  That's right, that's right.
[05:25:33.912 --> 05:25:34.672]  And that's the core.
[05:25:35.072 --> 05:25:35.592]  That's the core.
[05:25:35.913 --> 05:25:36.973]  That's where they get the public.
[05:25:37.233 --> 05:25:39.974]  You know, from the very beginning, I homeschooled my kids.
[05:25:39.994 --> 05:25:45.217]  One of the reasons we did it was because we knew from the very beginning that you go back to Horseman, you go back to John Dewey.
[05:25:45.557 --> 05:25:50.099]  These people, if you read their writings, they say why they wanted government schools.
[05:25:50.500 --> 05:25:53.067]  They say that they, you know, they wanted to indoctrinate the kids.
[05:25:53.127 --> 05:25:56.016]  They wanted to fundamentally transform society.
[05:25:56.937 --> 05:25:58.417]  Well, they're saying 100-plus hurt.
[05:25:58.957 --> 05:26:00.338]  Wow, this is CNN.
[05:26:00.378 --> 05:26:05.619]  They're saying 100-plus hurt in the tube blast near the Boston Marathon finish line.
[05:26:05.999 --> 05:26:06.219]  Wow.
[05:26:06.519 --> 05:26:09.300]  I'm sure many of those people are already in the hospital.
[05:26:09.320 --> 05:26:10.720]  Oh, that's terrible.
[05:26:11.200 --> 05:26:11.720]  That's terrible.
[05:26:12.580 --> 05:26:12.840]  Definitely.
[05:26:12.860 --> 05:26:14.901]  Really sorry to see that toll mounting.
[05:26:15.881 --> 05:26:20.062]  You know, we need to understand the thousands of people who died on September 11th.
[05:26:21.087 --> 05:26:31.892]  There were many more thousands that died because of wars that were started using that as a justification and we then find out later that there was no justification for the wars on those bases.
[05:26:31.992 --> 05:26:32.232]  Right.
[05:26:32.592 --> 05:26:37.154]  And freedoms are killed and die.
[05:26:38.155 --> 05:26:40.496]  Freedoms that people have given their lives to
[05:26:41.156 --> 05:26:41.938]  We're good to go.
[05:26:56.303 --> 05:27:00.984]  And I mean, it just makes me think about talking about CNN, when they had the Chris Dorner shooting.
[05:27:01.644 --> 05:27:14.306]  And they have, I can't remember her name, it's on CNN, and she has the expert on, and he's talking about, well, I hear the radio, but I don't think they're actually talking about burn the cabin down, when they say burn the mother effer down.
[05:27:14.346 --> 05:27:19.507]  I'm not sure how many ways you can interpret that, unless they are quoting, what's that, the roof is on fire.
[05:27:19.947 --> 05:27:22.427]  We don't need no water, then they just let it burn.
[05:27:22.988 --> 05:27:25.448]  And I mean, those are the news sources, and people will
[05:27:25.948 --> 05:27:28.989]  It doesn't matter how red-handed you catch them with something.
[05:27:29.269 --> 05:27:35.150]  You've got the tape, you've got the smoking gun, you've got the audio, the video of them saying it and doing it.
[05:27:35.170 --> 05:27:36.290]  They could be wearing a bloody shirt.
[05:27:36.310 --> 05:27:36.790]  It doesn't matter.
[05:27:36.811 --> 05:27:37.231]  It doesn't matter.
[05:27:37.251 --> 05:27:47.473]  They could be wearing a bloody shirt with a handwritten confession and a smoking shotgun on their back, you know, but if that doesn't match the official story, then it's not going to be told.
[05:27:48.533 --> 05:27:51.335]  And they're very selective about which deaths matter to them, too.
[05:27:51.355 --> 05:28:03.582]  You know, I mean, you look at the situation, we were just talking about this at the end of the week last week, how little coverage there was, and it really hadn't gotten any media coverage, this abortion trial that's going on in Philadelphia with Gosnell.
[05:28:04.222 --> 05:28:10.865]  It had gotten essentially no media coverage until Drudge talked about the fact that it had no media coverage, and then some media started picking it up.
[05:28:11.165 --> 05:28:18.667]  But a lot of them, like the Washington Post, a lot of the mainstream news organizations like that said, well, it's a local crime story.
[05:28:18.747 --> 05:28:19.548]  Well, you know...
[05:28:20.248 --> 05:28:23.169]  Sandy Hook, if you want to look at it, was a local crime story, right?
[05:28:23.489 --> 05:28:30.272]  And we have not had a moment that they haven't been hitting us with that since the middle of December.
[05:28:30.332 --> 05:28:34.534]  Here we are, four months later, and they're still hitting us with it.
[05:28:34.574 --> 05:28:38.276]  Now they're turning the families into essentially lobbyists for gun control.
[05:28:38.336 --> 05:28:41.477]  Well, they're on every show, they're at every press conference.
[05:28:41.497 --> 05:28:42.817]  I saw them on 60 Minutes.
[05:28:42.877 --> 05:28:45.098]  I'm sure they've been on many other things besides that.
[05:28:45.118 --> 05:28:46.878]  And I'm not, you know, trying to demonize a family.
[05:28:46.898 --> 05:28:51.179]  I'm just saying these people are definitely being used to push a specific agenda.
[05:28:51.440 --> 05:28:51.880]  Absolutely.
[05:28:52.240 --> 05:28:55.741]  And they are pushing an agenda because you look at how selective they are.
[05:28:55.901 --> 05:29:01.022]  If it's children being killed by drone strikes abroad, they're not interested in that.
[05:29:01.742 --> 05:29:05.663]  If the body count is many, many times what it is here, they don't care about that.
[05:29:05.683 --> 05:29:06.064]  That's not an issue.
[05:29:06.084 --> 05:29:07.424]  They don't care about Fast and Furious.
[05:29:07.944 --> 05:29:08.124]  No.
[05:29:08.304 --> 05:29:11.226]  You know, I mean, many people died.
[05:29:11.246 --> 05:29:12.928]  I'm sure some children have died.
[05:29:12.968 --> 05:29:17.391]  And, you know, the reason we can't calculate all those numbers is because we don't know exactly where the guns went.
[05:29:18.472 --> 05:29:19.652]  But many people have died.
[05:29:20.573 --> 05:29:24.216]  Brian Terry, the Border Patrol agent, police officers, and those are just the people we know of.
[05:29:24.776 --> 05:29:28.719]  And I believe it was Ted Nugent who said, you know, Brian Terry could have been his son.
[05:29:28.959 --> 05:29:29.139]  Yeah.
[05:29:29.159 --> 05:29:30.300]  But nobody cares about that.
[05:29:30.320 --> 05:29:30.700]  Yeah.
[05:29:30.740 --> 05:29:36.242]  You know, because it happened in some other country or because it wasn't hyped up on XYZ channel.
[05:29:36.622 --> 05:29:38.083]  You know, it's not anything they care about.
[05:29:38.103 --> 05:29:40.544]  They keep saying, it's for the children, it's for the children.
[05:29:40.904 --> 05:29:46.586]  Meanwhile, we're funding the Free Syrian Army who has little kids running around AK-47s and sticks of dynamite.
[05:29:47.066 --> 05:29:47.987]  And nobody cares about that.
[05:29:48.147 --> 05:29:50.168]  And then with the drone strikes, you've got...
[05:29:51.368 --> 05:29:53.830]  You've got Americans murdering children.
[05:29:54.410 --> 05:29:56.532]  You know, saying that they're going after some Al-Qaeda operatives.
[05:29:56.572 --> 05:30:06.399]  And you know, the interesting thing is, Leanne McAdoo is doing a story on it, and we were looking at the body counts, and the person who had the highest body count for drone deaths was Lindsey Graham.
[05:30:07.060 --> 05:30:07.860]  Bragging about it.
[05:30:08.001 --> 05:30:11.043]  I mean, even the people who were against the drone strikes.
[05:30:11.283 --> 05:30:13.967]  You know, we're not coming up with as large a body count as he was.
[05:30:14.027 --> 05:30:17.492]  And, you know, 4,700 or so people killed.
[05:30:17.632 --> 05:30:20.055]  That is not going after the leadership of Al-Qaeda.
[05:30:20.576 --> 05:30:22.338]  Okay, to say you've got 4,700.
[05:30:22.399 --> 05:30:24.602]  There are a lot of... And you can see the pictures.
[05:30:24.722 --> 05:30:25.443]  It's terrible.
[05:30:26.458 --> 05:30:32.000]  But, you know, they're very selective about what they want to cover and what they don't want to cover.
[05:30:32.041 --> 05:30:37.083]  They only cover the casualties that support their narrative, that support their agenda.
[05:30:37.343 --> 05:30:48.387]  You look at just at the end of this week, we're looking at the 20-year anniversary of when they burned the Branch Davidian compound down, and they cynically came in and said they started this whole raid, and the code word was Showtime.
[05:30:48.727 --> 05:30:52.189]  Okay, they had the news media on site as they made the initial raid.
[05:30:52.889 --> 05:31:01.113]  And of course, you know, if they knew anything about it, and perhaps they did, they would have known that, you know, these people that they're attacking were just expecting just that sort of thing.
[05:31:01.693 --> 05:31:09.437]  But as this narrative developed, they started painting Koresh as a child molester, and so they had to go in there for the kids, and then they wound up burning the kids to death.
[05:31:10.457 --> 05:31:12.780]  It's just it's just so it's really sick.
[05:31:12.820 --> 05:31:21.528]  We use that word a lot But it's really sick how they would do we have to go save the children from this wicked child molester And then they burn the kids alive in the building.
[05:31:21.648 --> 05:31:22.168]  Yeah.
[05:31:22.188 --> 05:31:30.917]  Oh, it's really sad It's really sad and you look at how many and yet again, you know in terms of the quantity and and ages and you know that community it was a very
[05:31:31.557 --> 05:31:32.018]  I don't know.
[05:31:51.417 --> 05:31:52.798]  But they have to do it to protect the kids.
[05:31:53.559 --> 05:31:57.322]  They had to kill the kids to protect the kids from David Koresh, right?
[05:31:57.862 --> 05:32:02.966]  As if the ATF's jurisdiction is child protection, okay?
[05:32:03.247 --> 05:32:06.309]  I mean, they spun that whole thing and everybody just fell for it.
[05:32:06.349 --> 05:32:08.291]  You know, they can spin the narrative any way they want to.
[05:32:09.111 --> 05:32:15.196]  We've got a possible suspect, they say, but we had somebody that was... Oh, a Saudi national, okay.
[05:32:15.377 --> 05:32:16.778]  Okay.
[05:32:16.818 --> 05:32:18.139]  And what source is this, guys?
[05:32:20.316 --> 05:32:21.416]  New York Post, okay.
[05:32:21.977 --> 05:32:24.477]  They were the ones in there earlier.
[05:32:24.757 --> 05:32:34.140]  So if you're listening on the radio, you can go to InfoWars.com forward slash listen and watch our broadcast and you can see the articles on the screen from there.
[05:32:34.220 --> 05:32:35.361]  So we have a suspect.
[05:32:36.501 --> 05:32:38.262]  We're going to be going to break in just a little while.
[05:32:38.282 --> 05:32:41.003]  We've got, is Mike Adams going to be joining us after the break?
[05:32:42.363 --> 05:32:42.683]  Okay.
[05:32:44.304 --> 05:32:44.604]  All right.
[05:32:45.124 --> 05:32:47.865]  So we'll be right back with Mike Adams in just a few minutes.
[05:32:47.885 --> 05:32:48.705]  We're going to take a quick break.
[05:32:52.293 --> 05:32:55.215]  I'm Leanne McAdoo and this is an InfoWars News Bulletin.
[05:32:55.836 --> 05:33:01.240]  Facebook will launch its latest data mining device with the release of Facebook Home on April 12th.
[05:33:01.820 --> 05:33:09.987]  The company's new move into the lucrative mobile advertising market comes on the heels of last year's pump and dump scandal which cost investors billions.
[05:33:10.967 --> 05:33:18.713]  The mobile app will first be available to Android users and according to the site, from the moment you wake your phone, you'll be immersed in cover feed.
[05:33:19.724 --> 05:33:28.911]  Before, if you wanted to be inundated with the vacuous status updates of your friends and pictures of their half-eaten breakfast, you had to manually launch the Facebook app.
[05:33:29.672 --> 05:33:30.372]  Well, no more.
[05:33:30.833 --> 05:33:32.454]  Behold, the future.
[05:33:33.255 --> 05:33:47.146]  By replacing the unlock and home screen of your phone, the company that's determined to creep into every area of your life can now flood your phone with pictures, chat requests, and suggestions without even needing to be unlocked.
[05:33:48.356 --> 05:33:52.978]  With Facebook Home, you're basically authorizing the complete surrender of your privacy.
[05:33:53.419 --> 05:34:11.668]  Much like its web-based counterpart that is no stranger to privacy encroachment, Home will collect information like your location, how you connect with friends, what sort of apps you interact with, and your internet searches in order to personalize the advertising that will besiege your handheld device while it's awake.
[05:34:12.913 --> 05:34:19.798]  As we've reported before, Facebook is regularly used by the IRS to scan your account and Twitter feed while conducting audits.
[05:34:20.399 --> 05:34:29.906]  Now, if you launch an app via Facebook Home, information about your purchases could be stored and subject to subpoena, much like all the other information Facebook collects on you.
[05:34:30.586 --> 05:34:43.294]  Law enforcement officials also scour social networks using facial recognition software and have arrested people like this 20-year-old for posting a picture of graffiti to her Facebook-owned Instagram account.
[05:34:44.314 --> 05:34:52.079]  Even something as innocent as liking a religious or political page or attending a rally is collected and can be used against you.
[05:34:53.393 --> 05:35:04.780]  Why then would anyone want to be smartphone shackled to a social network that's known for mining and collecting data and then providing that information to advertisers and other nefarious systems?
[05:35:05.501 --> 05:35:14.687]  Basically, the app signals Facebook's ideal, to have you chronically connected to the Facebook interface so it can be the sole data house of citizen intelligence.
[05:35:15.327 --> 05:35:26.532]  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg emphasized that home is built around people, not apps, which means that users can spend more time interacting with their friends and families on their smartphones.
[05:35:27.272 --> 05:35:35.836]  Well, if by family he means keeping you perpetually connected to Big Brother, Big Sis, and DARPA, well kudos to you, Zuckerberg.
[05:35:36.216 --> 05:35:38.357]  Maybe you were right about your Facebook users.
[05:35:41.124 --> 05:35:42.565]  Yeah, he calls them dumb effers.
[05:35:42.905 --> 05:35:44.406]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have Mike Adams.
[05:35:44.426 --> 05:35:46.567]  He's under the weather, but still battling hard today.
[05:35:47.008 --> 05:35:50.470]  We first posted an article he put out about 30 minutes ago on Infowars.com.
[05:35:50.490 --> 05:35:58.695]  It's also at NaturalNews.com, where they talked about a drill going on, a controlled detonation, and that was going on at the end and during this.
[05:35:59.155 --> 05:36:00.236]  People tried to spin it.
[05:36:01.096 --> 05:36:06.900]  No, ladies and gentlemen, we found a local 15 news.
[05:36:07.380 --> 05:36:09.342]  We have the video and the article right here.
[05:36:09.402 --> 05:36:10.362]  Document Cam, please.
[05:36:31.656 --> 05:36:31.997]  No, no, no.
[05:36:32.217 --> 05:36:37.600]  They kept making announcements on the loudspeaker that it was just a drill and there was nothing to worry about.
[05:36:38.600 --> 05:36:41.542]  Same thing was said on 9-11 over the loudspeakers.
[05:36:41.562 --> 05:36:42.983]  That's confirmed, Associated Press.
[05:36:43.443 --> 05:36:46.785]  Same thing at the Denver shootings, the Aurora shootings.
[05:36:47.325 --> 05:36:51.848]  Announcements about everything's fine and then now there's a shooting going on in the theater over speakers.
[05:36:53.923 --> 05:37:05.115]  Again, University of Mobile's cross-country coach, who was near the finish line of the Boston Marathon when a series of explosions went off, said he thought it was odd when there were bomb-sniffing dogs at the start and finish lines.
[05:37:05.455 --> 05:37:10.360]  They kept making announcements on the loudspeaker that it was just a drill and there was nothing to worry about.
[05:37:11.235 --> 05:37:14.797]  Same thing was the Madrid bombings on 333 that turned out was the government.
[05:37:14.837 --> 05:37:15.838]  That's in the Spanish news.
[05:37:17.018 --> 05:37:18.479]  The leader of the country had to step down over it.
[05:37:18.939 --> 05:37:25.023]  Coach Ollie Stevenson told News 15, it seems like there's some sort of threat, but they kept telling us it was just a drill.
[05:37:25.943 --> 05:37:26.723]  And it goes on.
[05:37:27.204 --> 05:37:28.765]  Stevenson had just finished the marathon.
[05:37:28.805 --> 05:37:36.609]  His wife had been sitting in one of the seating sections when an explosion went off, but thankfully she left her seat and was walking to meet up with him.
[05:37:38.208 --> 05:37:39.209]  They were just smoke.
[05:37:39.249 --> 05:37:40.230]  Another explosion went off.
[05:37:40.610 --> 05:37:42.912]  He goes on to say that he believes, obviously, it was a terror attack.
[05:37:42.952 --> 05:37:45.694]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to go to Mike Adams here.
[05:37:45.714 --> 05:37:46.774]  I want to explain something to you.
[05:37:46.815 --> 05:37:53.279]  When you study this, it's like if you own a French bulldog, you know what a French bulldog looks like.
[05:37:53.760 --> 05:37:54.520]  You know how they act.
[05:37:54.540 --> 05:37:55.401]  You know their mannerisms.
[05:37:57.162 --> 05:38:00.145]  But even if you don't own a French bulldog, you know what a French bulldog looks like.
[05:38:00.485 --> 05:38:01.105]  Most people do.
[05:38:01.165 --> 05:38:02.046]  Even idiots do.
[05:38:02.106 --> 05:38:02.927]  It's a popular dog.
[05:38:03.772 --> 05:38:15.657]  Now there's been enough Gulf of Tonkin, 7-7, all this stuff, where you need to know that in every case they run a drill of the exact same targets being hit at the exact same time.
[05:38:16.057 --> 05:38:16.978]  Why do they do that?
[05:38:17.418 --> 05:38:19.579]  Because most police and government are not involved.
[05:38:20.679 --> 05:38:29.743]  And they may catch the compartmentalized group of mercenaries or whoever that are posing as police or deep cover in the police, staging the event,
[05:38:31.348 --> 05:38:34.393]  And then what they do is they say, oh, we're part of the drill.
[05:38:34.774 --> 05:38:42.727]  Putin's people, back in 1999 when he was running for president and wasn't going to win, reportedly got caught staging bombings all over Russia.
[05:38:44.229 --> 05:38:57.132]  And then local Moscow police in a suburb caught his FSB, his Federal Security Bureau, his FBI, in a fourth building planting bombs with hexogen explosives, high-powered Russian plastique.
[05:38:57.813 --> 05:39:02.614]  And they spun it and the police were ordered to release them by the Feds in Russia, saying it was part of a drill.
[05:39:03.154 --> 05:39:04.494]  And it turned out there was a drill.
[05:39:07.235 --> 05:39:09.716]  And so this has been done over and over again.
[05:39:12.293 --> 05:39:12.953]  Infinitum.
[05:39:14.054 --> 05:39:20.196]  So the fact that on 7-7 the exact same trains, exact same bus, bombed at the exact same time in a drill.
[05:39:20.996 --> 05:39:23.717]  Madrid, police everywhere with bomb sniffing dogs.
[05:39:23.957 --> 05:39:29.439]  Then they went and killed the supposed Patsy's a month later in a safe house and it came out the government did the bombing.
[05:39:30.499 --> 05:39:33.480]  You can go to YouTube guys and pull up Madrid bombing and just show it.
[05:39:33.540 --> 05:39:34.480]  It's amazing footage.
[05:39:35.061 --> 05:39:37.321]  One bomb goes off, people are running, another one goes off.
[05:39:37.361 --> 05:39:38.522]  It's all in my film Terror Storm.
[05:39:39.597 --> 05:39:41.205]  British SAS were caught.
[05:39:41.265 --> 05:39:42.229]  Special Air Services.
[05:39:45.051 --> 05:39:53.495]  Assigned to MI6, dressed up like Wahhabis, Saudi Arabians, blowing stuff up all over Basra to get the Shiites and Sunnis killing each other.
[05:39:53.835 --> 05:39:59.358]  You go blow up a Shiite mosque, they're gonna go kill a bunch of Sunnis, and then that's your war simulant.
[05:39:59.938 --> 05:40:02.980]  That's your excuse to be there to get the oil and set up the police state.
[05:40:03.000 --> 05:40:04.101]  You understand?
[05:40:04.501 --> 05:40:10.764]  Just like Mohammed Karzai came out a month and a half ago and said, look, the West is staging these bombings, which the evidence showed, I don't disagree with him,
[05:40:11.889 --> 05:40:17.614]  The President of Afghanistan, he said you're staging this as a pretext to destabilize the country and stay here to control the opium.
[05:40:17.874 --> 05:40:18.434]  Which is true!
[05:40:18.514 --> 05:40:21.477]  He should know, his brother was the biggest opium dealer in modern history.
[05:40:22.598 --> 05:40:24.559]  All of this, they think you're dumb.
[05:40:24.579 --> 05:40:30.284]  They flew up to 50,000 Taliban Al-Qaeda out to safety at the end of the stage six-month war in Afghanistan.
[05:40:30.304 --> 05:40:31.845]  It really is a month long, but it's mopping up.
[05:40:32.486 --> 05:40:35.688]  They called it the airlift of evil to start the next destabilization of Pakistan.
[05:40:35.968 --> 05:40:37.490]  Just like the government runs Al-Qaeda out of
[05:40:38.621 --> 05:40:41.324]  Saudi Arabia and Libya and Syria now on record.
[05:40:41.984 --> 05:40:46.589]  And they're going to start shooting airliners out of the sky with these 10,000 heatseekers they've got.
[05:40:46.609 --> 05:40:51.454]  Those things can go up to 10,000, 20,000 feet in the air depending on the types.
[05:40:51.474 --> 05:40:52.555]  They've got several different types.
[05:40:53.115 --> 05:40:54.677]  Around 18,000 missiles total.
[05:40:55.097 --> 05:41:01.103]  10,000 are estimated to be pretty high-tech French and Russian heatseekers.
[05:41:02.034 --> 05:41:06.576]  Of course, Obama's doing lots of stage photo ops, how he's going to save everybody, and he's so concerned.
[05:41:06.616 --> 05:41:07.376]  He's our guardian.
[05:41:07.796 --> 05:41:15.539]  As Robert Shapiro said in the Financial Times of London a couple years ago, he said, we need a new Oklahoma City to get our political agenda through.
[05:41:17.119 --> 05:41:18.020]  We're going to Mike Adams.
[05:41:18.060 --> 05:41:21.761]  I just want to point out, I said this morning, I said this morning,
[05:41:22.813 --> 05:41:27.375]  In the first hour before this happened, I said, I feel terror attacks.
[05:41:27.415 --> 05:41:33.817]  And I said, whether it's Al Qaeda or blaming it on Patriot groups, they're all over the news saying, get ready for IEDs, get ready for bombings.
[05:41:33.897 --> 05:41:36.838]  When it happens, we're going to take all your rights and keep you safe.
[05:41:37.697 --> 05:41:42.919]  I mean, you see it in the dramas, the sitcoms, the ads, the news.
[05:41:43.099 --> 05:41:45.481]  It is full immersion at a level I've never seen.
[05:41:45.861 --> 05:41:46.601]  So it's not hard.
[05:41:46.981 --> 05:41:54.004]  It's like if the government went, if space aliens land in Central Park next month, the thing to do is to bow to them and do what they say.
[05:41:54.505 --> 05:41:57.026]  If the news started saying that, I'd go, have they made a deal with aliens?
[05:41:57.226 --> 05:41:58.326]  I mean, this is hypothetical.
[05:41:58.947 --> 05:42:00.387]  It's really satire, but I'm serious.
[05:42:00.627 --> 05:42:01.868]  I don't really believe aliens.
[05:42:01.888 --> 05:42:03.649]  I know Salon's watching.
[05:42:04.489 --> 05:42:06.571]  CNN's watching, everybody's watching us right now.
[05:42:06.991 --> 05:42:09.112]  I'm not really saying aliens, I'm saying the analogy.
[05:42:09.973 --> 05:42:15.097]  If aliens, you know, the Plutogorps may land next week and you must worship them when they land.
[05:42:15.837 --> 05:42:18.019]  Then if they landed, we'd know they made a deal with them.
[05:42:18.619 --> 05:42:20.501]  I mean, it's so obvious, the scripting.
[05:42:21.201 --> 05:42:23.983]  Where they're like, the right-wingers are merging with Al-Qaeda.
[05:42:24.223 --> 05:42:25.624]  They're going to attack America.
[05:42:25.964 --> 05:42:27.345]  Al-Qaeda is with the Tea Party.
[05:42:27.686 --> 05:42:29.587]  You know, show them some of the headlines.
[05:42:30.668 --> 05:42:31.108]  Here's one.
[05:42:31.128 --> 05:42:31.769]  I got some info, guys.
[05:42:32.911 --> 05:42:33.411]  Absolutely.
[05:42:33.431 --> 05:42:39.793]  Okay, so we've got Mike Adams there on air right now, so let's go ahead and go to him since he's potted up on air.
[05:42:40.113 --> 05:42:44.254]  Mike, I'm going to get into the fact, I'm going to finish this point, and then we're going to go to Mike right here, okay?
[05:42:44.754 --> 05:42:45.034]  Alright.
[05:42:45.354 --> 05:42:46.675]  I'm going to go to this point.
[05:42:46.755 --> 05:42:48.715]  Is he on the air or is he just in my ear?
[05:42:50.315 --> 05:42:52.536]  Okay, well we're going to go to him on air in just a moment.
[05:42:53.256 --> 05:42:55.677]  Okay, going over this here.
[05:42:56.926 --> 05:42:57.367]  Look at this.
[05:42:57.567 --> 05:42:59.329]  This is out of media eye.
[05:42:59.429 --> 05:43:07.299]  Look, Alex Jones declares Boston a false flag operation, FBI behind every domestic terror plotter.
[05:43:07.339 --> 05:43:09.042]  I'll just hold it up for you so you can see it that way.
[05:43:09.522 --> 05:43:12.746]  Okay, so there is that article right there.
[05:43:13.347 --> 05:43:14.248]  Here it is right here.
[05:43:15.282 --> 05:43:19.227]  Out of Salon, Alex Jones, Boston Explosion, is a government conspiracy.
[05:43:19.387 --> 05:43:31.320]  Well, if every other big one has been staged, and if they've been caught doing it hundreds of times with Gladio alone, Ajax, Tonkin, you name it, I would be crazy not to come out and say they're the prime suspect.
[05:43:31.400 --> 05:43:32.582]  And now there's a drill.
[05:43:32.922 --> 05:43:34.304]  Now Mike Adams has breaking
[05:43:34.844 --> 05:43:39.028]  News and we appreciate him of naturalnews.com coming on with us.
[05:43:39.568 --> 05:43:41.851]  But all the prescripting is the key here.
[05:43:41.891 --> 05:43:42.972]  Let's bring Mike Adams up.
[05:43:43.672 --> 05:43:49.638]  Mike, I wanted to get that out there before Jakari Jackson and David Knight come back in.
[05:43:49.678 --> 05:43:52.120]  Thank you so much for joining us here.
[05:43:52.700 --> 05:43:54.622]  I know you're tracking this as well.
[05:43:55.923 --> 05:44:01.888]  Over at naturalnews.com, at infowars.com, eyewitness authorities announced drill before Boston explosions.
[05:44:02.028 --> 05:44:03.429]  UM coach thought it was odd.
[05:44:03.469 --> 05:44:05.210]  Bomb-sniffing dogs were at the start and finish lines.
[05:44:05.490 --> 05:44:07.372]  The biggest issue was the announcements.
[05:44:07.452 --> 05:44:08.232]  The announcements.
[05:44:08.572 --> 05:44:09.533]  That is unprecedented.
[05:44:09.553 --> 05:44:11.274]  We need to add that to Paul Watson's article.
[05:44:12.115 --> 05:44:14.697]  Continuing terror bombing at Boston Marathon.
[05:44:14.977 --> 05:44:16.978]  California signs petition to ban guns.
[05:44:17.299 --> 05:44:18.419]  Let's go to you right now.
[05:44:18.500 --> 05:44:22.723]  Mike Adams, what is your information on this?
[05:44:22.763 --> 05:44:24.364]  What's your spidey sense on this right now?
[05:44:25.418 --> 05:44:40.768]  Well the first thing is we are screen capturing everything that we can find right now because they're already starting to change some of the tweets and some of the information that's gone out there so the big story is that yes the bomb sniffing dogs were at the start lines and the finish line for the drill
[05:44:41.548 --> 05:44:59.613]  And those people who are saying that no, no, no, this library explosion was just a controlled explosion to get rid of the bomb, they don't know what they're talking about because if you've ever worked with a bomb squad, and I have, not as an officer, but you know I trained, I served on a non-profit in Arizona, I worked with SWAT people, I trained
[05:45:00.613 --> 05:45:04.774]  I've been around some of the bomb guys.
[05:45:05.254 --> 05:45:11.216]  You do not analyze, rig, and detonate a suspicious package in less than one hour.
[05:45:11.736 --> 05:45:12.636]  It doesn't happen.
[05:45:13.016 --> 05:45:18.758]  It's a whole afternoon to get that done because you have to be cautious, you have to evacuate the area, all kinds of things.
[05:45:19.378 --> 05:45:33.263]  So this explanation that somehow this library explosion was just the bomb squad having miraculously found the bomb and then detonating it, and by the way they set the library on fire temporarily when they did that, that's ludicrous!
[05:45:33.563 --> 05:45:37.005]  So people need to understand what it takes to detonate a bomb.
[05:45:38.025 --> 05:45:40.426]  It's a very slow, meticulous process.
[05:45:40.646 --> 05:45:44.747]  Ask any bomb squad member in any police department anywhere across the country.
[05:45:46.587 --> 05:45:50.791]  The other thing that's fishy about this is that today is Patriots Day in Massachusetts.
[05:45:51.452 --> 05:45:52.393]  This is Patriots Day.
[05:45:52.493 --> 05:45:56.958]  April 15th is Patriots Day in Massachusetts.
[05:45:57.158 --> 05:45:57.478]  Alright?
[05:45:58.279 --> 05:46:02.063]  So, they can then call this the Patriot Day bombing.
[05:46:03.587 --> 05:46:06.489]  What a convenient blame game, right?
[05:46:06.930 --> 05:46:07.670]  So convenient.
[05:46:08.291 --> 05:46:17.758]  Now, on the other hand, there are some things about this explosion that, in my mind, sort of contraindicate it as a false flag.
[05:46:17.778 --> 05:46:28.786]  And I want to put this out there because it's very early, we're getting information on both sides, but I just want to at least discuss this because it's interesting and we need to understand why this is happening.
[05:46:30.287 --> 05:46:31.308]  Can you still hear me okay?
[05:46:32.208 --> 05:46:33.349]  Absolutely, Mike.
[05:46:33.369 --> 05:46:34.830]  We're just sitting back listening to you.
[05:46:34.890 --> 05:46:38.051]  And again, they're also saying Saudis may be involved.
[05:46:38.131 --> 05:46:46.036]  My whole point, and I'm being demonized by Salon and others, was the media would try to blame patriots, which they've now done on CNN.
[05:46:46.056 --> 05:46:49.598]  I'm uploading that video to our YouTube channel right now.
[05:46:49.878 --> 05:46:56.342]  They are on CNN blaming us, blaming the Liberty Movement, saying we could be involved, but separately
[05:46:57.264 --> 05:47:01.086]  They're then saying we're kooks for saying they might do that when we were correct.
[05:47:01.946 --> 05:47:07.988]  Well we know, even the New York Times has reported on the FBI running the terror plots year after year across the country.
[05:47:08.309 --> 05:47:23.755]  This could have been, I'm not saying it is, I'm not saying all FBI people are bad, but it could have been an FBI terror plot that got out of hand where they ended up delivering actual explosives rather than the typical duds that they use to rush in and arrest the patsies and then claim they stopped terrorism.
[05:47:24.315 --> 05:47:26.877]  But here's some other information I think is interesting.
[05:47:27.337 --> 05:47:29.859]  You and I talked about predictions of false flags.
[05:47:30.259 --> 05:47:32.140]  You know, you've been talking about it for many, many years.
[05:47:32.180 --> 05:47:38.545]  I think last week on your show, I predicted that it would be much, much larger than this, that I thought the government would be willing to kill a million people.
[05:47:39.005 --> 05:47:43.588]  So in terms of an explosion, this is relatively small.
[05:47:44.308 --> 05:47:46.870]  I'm not trying to make light of those who are injured or killed.
[05:47:47.350 --> 05:47:49.212]  Obviously, it's a horrifying event.
[05:47:49.592 --> 05:47:53.995]  But in terms of what could have been planned and carried out, it is relatively small.
[05:47:54.595 --> 05:47:57.396]  A second point is that this wasn't targeted at children.
[05:47:57.416 --> 05:48:08.481]  Now normally in false flags we see children targeted such as in Oklahoma City with the nursery in the building because children of course allow the government to have a more emotional plea like we see with Sandy Hook.
[05:48:09.161 --> 05:48:13.943]  So it is at least interesting that children don't appear to have been targeted in this.
[05:48:14.924 --> 05:48:19.306]  Another point is that there were no firearms used in the explosion, not to our knowledge anyway.
[05:48:20.126 --> 05:48:30.279]  So if they were really trying to use this to go after firearms, you would think that they would have had an AR-15 nearby or some handguns or something to try to blame firearms.
[05:48:31.120 --> 05:48:36.728]  Another thing is that this explosion was using a device that is already illegal.
[05:48:37.268 --> 05:48:38.310]  It's illegal to make a bomb.
[05:48:39.737 --> 05:48:42.279]  Just to make one, even at your own house.
[05:48:42.799 --> 05:48:43.240]  It's illegal.
[05:48:43.280 --> 05:48:44.421]  It's a violation of federal law.
[05:48:44.441 --> 05:48:56.009]  So, if they were trying to create a fear about something that they wanted to ban, they would have used a legal product such as Tannerite, perhaps.
[05:48:56.029 --> 05:48:57.190]  Well, look, here's the issue.
[05:48:57.510 --> 05:48:59.612]  I've got some other breaking news here, but I want to be clear.
[05:48:59.672 --> 05:49:06.377]  Here is the blaze, Glenn Beck's website, joining with Salon and joining with Mediaite
[05:49:08.003 --> 05:49:11.204]  And by the way, on Mediaite, is that how you say it?
[05:49:11.264 --> 05:49:11.865]  Mediaite?
[05:49:12.505 --> 05:49:21.468]  On Mediaite, basically one of these George Soros connected groups, last time I looked it up, Alex Jones declared Boston a false flag operation, FBI behind every domestic terror plot.
[05:49:21.988 --> 05:49:26.330]  Number one, Paul Watson, who's on my Twitter, he sent that out.
[05:49:26.370 --> 05:49:28.071]  But by the way, I stand by what he said.
[05:49:28.491 --> 05:49:33.833]  Paul Watson linked to the New York Times, guys type in their headline, New York Times,
[05:49:36.550 --> 05:49:37.031]  We're good to go.
[05:49:57.066 --> 05:50:00.308]  I mean, you know, the head of the Italian Supreme Court's come out saying Bilderberg's behind it.
[05:50:00.749 --> 05:50:05.292]  Obviously, we've got to look at this on Patriots Day with all this, but here's Mediaite.
[05:50:05.332 --> 05:50:13.638]  Guys, go to Mediaite because they have the article, a separate article from them, about CNN saying it could be right-wing extremist.
[05:50:14.158 --> 05:50:15.739]  That's the article I want to show.
[05:50:16.019 --> 05:50:17.721]  I've got the one about Alex Jones.
[05:50:17.741 --> 05:50:18.681]  I've got a bunch of these.
[05:50:19.342 --> 05:50:25.026]  Okay, what I'm saying here is that obviously they're going to try to blame us or somehow spin it that way.
[05:50:25.666 --> 05:50:25.966]  Clearly.
[05:50:26.507 --> 05:50:32.114]  I said they could even say Al-Qaeda's working with the Tea Party because that's what they've been reporting.
[05:50:32.134 --> 05:50:39.162]  You know, the Forbes headline, Washington Times headline, Army trains to crush Tea Party rebellion with Al-Qaeda involved.
[05:50:39.443 --> 05:50:40.164]  That's crazy!
[05:50:40.484 --> 05:50:41.746]  I'm not the one saying that.
[05:50:42.066 --> 05:50:43.107]  Of course it's ridiculous.
[05:50:43.368 --> 05:50:44.990]  Saw the Fox News headline last week.
[05:50:45.430 --> 05:50:49.051]  You know, military taught that Christians are terrorists.
[05:50:49.091 --> 05:50:50.572]  Christians are extremists.
[05:50:50.892 --> 05:50:55.194]  We all know about this, and they don't want us taking their narrative away.
[05:50:55.214 --> 05:51:03.097]  But notice, Glenn Beck, who calls me a fascist, and I even said today, before all this happened, I said, I'm going to try to be nice to Glenn Beck.
[05:51:03.437 --> 05:51:05.738]  There it is, terrorist plots hatched by the FBI.
[05:51:06.018 --> 05:51:10.760]  That's the article we linked to, and it goes on to say almost every event was hatched and created by the FBI.
[05:51:10.980 --> 05:51:11.600]  Print that for me.
[05:51:11.980 --> 05:51:13.622]  That's what we link to in the Twitter.
[05:51:13.802 --> 05:51:15.144]  In fact, I want to retweet that.
[05:51:15.164 --> 05:51:19.909]  If somebody's got my phone uploading that video I shot, I want to retweet that to Glenn Beck.
[05:51:20.550 --> 05:51:20.770]  Okay?
[05:51:20.790 --> 05:51:21.891]  And say, come on, man!
[05:51:22.352 --> 05:51:26.136]  You have no future, we have no future, if the globalists carry this out.
[05:51:26.396 --> 05:51:30.440]  I'll assure you, the socialists, when they take over, buddy, are going to come after you, okay?
[05:51:31.141 --> 05:51:34.624]  Alright, Alex, the bomb squad is the smoking gun here.
[05:51:35.064 --> 05:51:45.413]  Despite all the other things I mentioned, the fishiness of the bomb squad being able to detonate that third bomb and call it a drill, that right there means that they had prior knowledge of the event.
[05:51:45.834 --> 05:51:47.215]  And how many times have we seen that?
[05:51:47.315 --> 05:51:58.044]  Where the bomb squads actually carried out the events in order to scare the local populations and get more budget funding and more power for themselves, as well as sometimes at the federal level.
[05:51:59.505 --> 05:52:05.509]  I think there are arguments on both sides, but this is going to go probably very quickly.
[05:52:05.529 --> 05:52:08.051]  We're going to get more information and the picture is going to come together.
[05:52:10.942 --> 05:52:18.007]  Okay, so, the fact that it's Patriots Day, again, is important because they can blame Patriots for the holiday.
[05:52:18.027 --> 05:52:25.212]  They can say, even though they say they've arrested a Saudi national, like you said, Alex, they can claim that the Saudi nationals are working with the Tea Party.
[05:52:25.452 --> 05:52:27.714]  They've already laid the groundwork for that.
[05:52:28.154 --> 05:52:35.459]  But, I do say, it could have been a lot worse for us, who believe in the Republic, who believe in the Constitution.
[05:52:35.479 --> 05:52:36.480]  It could have been a lot worse.
[05:52:36.940 --> 05:52:37.461]  It could have been
[05:52:38.121 --> 05:52:41.504]  A bomb that was wrapped in shrapnel, for example.
[05:52:41.804 --> 05:52:45.107]  Now, I looked at the explosion video over and over again.
[05:52:45.608 --> 05:52:48.390]  It did not appear to use shrapnel.
[05:52:48.931 --> 05:52:55.056]  Now, if you look at, for example, one of the runners that was about, let's say, six meters away from the bomb.
[05:52:55.497 --> 05:52:58.819]  He was knocked to the ground by only a concussive blast.
[05:52:59.600 --> 05:53:10.851]  Now, a concussive blast can be dangerous, it can make you bleed, it can cause internal organ damage, but it's not nearly as deadly as a bomb that is surrounded by shrapnel, you know, nails and scrap metal and things like that.
[05:53:11.471 --> 05:53:20.920]  So, it's early, we can't tell for sure, but I believe this bomb did not use shrapnel, which is very interesting, because if you're trying to have a massive carnage,
[05:53:21.854 --> 05:53:22.775]  You would have used shrapnel.
[05:53:23.635 --> 05:53:28.580]  So, that's a question I have, and again, I have a question about... Sure, sure, but here's the timing.
[05:53:29.100 --> 05:53:35.786]  You've got them on a razor margin, looks like they can't get the guns banned in the House, they've gotten the restrictions in the Senate.
[05:53:36.106 --> 05:53:47.976]  This creates a love of government, approval ratings go up, Obama is going to go to a press conference, just like Robert Shapiro said, new Oklahoma City, or new terror attacks, new 9-11, that's the quote, you'll be more popular.
[05:53:48.536 --> 05:53:50.517]  And they don't say where these are supposed to come from.
[05:53:50.537 --> 05:53:53.438]  That's Financial Times of London and others.
[05:53:54.198 --> 05:53:56.859]  And so people need to understand, here is the Mediaite article.
[05:53:56.879 --> 05:53:59.420]  We can put it up on screen so I can tell everybody.
[05:53:59.580 --> 05:54:06.383]  CNN, that's it, good job, CNN National Security Analyst warns of right-wing extremists behind Boston bombings.
[05:54:06.483 --> 05:54:10.325]  Now, I said they would do that, but in the same Mediaite,
[05:54:10.945 --> 05:54:11.665]  Look at this, folks.
[05:54:11.985 --> 05:54:18.708]  In the same media-ite, Alex Jones declares Boston a false flag operation, FBI behind every domestic terror plot.
[05:54:19.028 --> 05:54:25.770]  No, I said our hearts go out to these people, our prayers go out, but this thing stinks to high heaven like a false flag.
[05:54:26.110 --> 05:54:29.952]  Like the New York Times said, almost all these plots are hatched by the government.
[05:54:30.992 --> 05:54:38.675]  Now, what does media-ite, Salon and Glenn Beck, all establishment, playing the part of liberals, playing the part of the new libertarian leader,
[05:54:39.437 --> 05:54:41.398]  And again, I'm not going to fight with Glenn Beck.
[05:54:41.799 --> 05:54:43.560]  You know, nobody else does this.
[05:54:43.700 --> 05:54:46.362]  I mean, Michael Savage will probably come out and say it could be Obama.
[05:54:46.502 --> 05:54:47.302]  That's common sense.
[05:54:47.663 --> 05:54:49.063]  I bet Limbaugh even does that.
[05:54:49.324 --> 05:54:56.849]  But instead, I'm just telling you, snake in the grass, man, even after I've said publicly, because I know Glenn gets a lot of stuff from our show,
[05:54:57.409 --> 05:54:58.390]  You know, just day after day.
[05:54:58.470 --> 05:55:00.833]  I want it to stop, because people say, well, why cover Glenn Beck?
[05:55:01.233 --> 05:55:08.462]  He is a key person, and if something happens to us, folks, he's all that's really going to be there, and I want people to carry on getting the truth out here.
[05:55:08.702 --> 05:55:09.142]  But here it is.
[05:55:09.243 --> 05:55:13.127]  CNN National Security Analyst warns of right-wing extremists behind Boston bombing.
[05:55:13.147 --> 05:55:14.448]  See, I know we're real.
[05:55:15.069 --> 05:55:16.350]  I know we're under surveillance.
[05:55:16.470 --> 05:55:17.550]  I know we're fighting hard.
[05:55:17.951 --> 05:55:27.336]  And it just hurts me to know, he's pretty much, this seals the deal, that number one, they spin and twist what I said and are listening and watching right now.
[05:55:27.456 --> 05:55:32.639]  And it just, it really hurts me because I want to defeat Agenda 21 that I covered 17 years ago.
[05:55:33.259 --> 05:55:36.281]  I want to defeat, you know, MSNBC saying your kids belong to the state.
[05:55:36.601 --> 05:55:38.222]  And I want to work with everybody.
[05:55:38.722 --> 05:55:41.084]  Even if they don't want to work with us, I want to just be nice.
[05:55:41.864 --> 05:56:11.310]  and and and this hurts my feelings that you know we're right of course and and listen here's the other news and we'll get your take on this Mike Adams this broke thirty minutes ago uh... authorities ID suspect is Saudi national in marathon bombings under guard at Boston Hospital uh... they're saying they got footage people with backpacks and stuff well everybody has backpacks uh... and uh... now they're saying twelve dead fifty injured after two explosions rock boston marathon it's getting worse and worse what's the latest numbers I'll be live at seven o'clock tonight I'm gonna bring back Jakari Jackson and
[05:56:12.928 --> 05:56:16.192]  Okay, well this one says 12 dead, 50 injured after two explosions rocked.
[05:56:16.613 --> 05:56:18.615]  So that's the New York Post.
[05:56:19.156 --> 05:56:22.320]  Actually, if you scroll down to that New York Post, what is Drudge saying?
[05:56:22.360 --> 05:56:24.122]  DrudgeReport.com.
[05:56:25.404 --> 05:56:26.685]  Man, thank God for Drudge.
[05:56:26.745 --> 05:56:28.327]  It's just good to know there's some good people out there.
[05:56:29.540 --> 05:56:33.082]  are egomaniac crazy people that are there to put down other patriots.
[05:56:33.462 --> 05:56:34.762]  I'm not going to get off in a diversion.
[05:56:34.802 --> 05:56:42.466]  I'm just sick of being here on the front lines and people right beside me shooting at me politically when all I'm trying to do is have a future for my children.
[05:56:42.746 --> 05:56:48.249]  Mike Adams, there is no doubt that almost all the other terror events have been staged or provocateured.
[05:56:48.509 --> 05:56:49.729]  Again, here's the New York Times.
[05:56:49.969 --> 05:56:51.470]  And of course, I don't just believe the New York Times.
[05:56:51.810 --> 05:56:54.932]  We've done countless reports on this Mike Adams
[05:56:56.147 --> 05:57:03.854]  Where they openly, I'm going to find the article in the New York Times, Sunday Review, show these people terrorist plots hatched by the FBI.
[05:57:03.894 --> 05:57:08.898]  The United States has been narrowly saved from lethal terrorist plots in recent years, or so it has seemed.
[05:57:09.539 --> 05:57:12.121]  A would-be suicide bomber was intercepted on his way to the Capitol.
[05:57:12.442 --> 05:57:17.286]  A scheme to bomb synagogues and shoot Stinger missiles at military aircraft was developed by a man in Newark, New York.
[05:57:18.467 --> 05:57:23.170]  He goes on, it's a fanciful idea to fly an explosive-laden model of planes in the Pentagon and the Capitol.
[05:57:23.190 --> 05:57:24.651]  It was hatched in Massachusetts.
[05:57:24.871 --> 05:57:27.472]  But all three dramas were facilitated by the FBI.
[05:57:27.632 --> 05:57:40.380]  Whole cloth, where undercover agents and informants pose as terrorists, officially, offering dummy missiles, fake C4 explosives, those are the real thing, and disarmed suicide vests and rudimentary training, like the first World Trade Center bombing.
[05:57:40.420 --> 05:57:43.581]  The government cooked a bomb, trained them all, found two mentally retarded guys.
[05:57:43.782 --> 05:57:45.202]  That's even in the New York Times back then.
[05:57:45.623 --> 05:57:47.624]  And it goes on to admit that it was all fake.
[05:57:48.165 --> 05:57:51.855]  I'm not bad for saying, hey, they've done this before.
[05:57:51.896 --> 05:57:54.543]  It could be provocateured or it could be purely staged.
[05:57:54.583 --> 05:57:55.125]  What do you say?
[05:57:56.274 --> 05:57:56.914]  There's no question.
[05:57:56.934 --> 05:57:59.997]  The FBI has been involved in numerous terror plots.
[05:58:00.097 --> 05:58:01.097]  That's on the record.
[05:58:01.177 --> 05:58:02.739]  Like you said, the New York Times wrote about that.
[05:58:03.219 --> 05:58:04.340]  And they always have patsies.
[05:58:04.380 --> 05:58:10.904]  Basically, they target mentally retarded individuals who are then held up as patsies.
[05:58:10.944 --> 05:58:18.850]  But when this explosion first happened, when I first got word of it today, the first thought that went through my mind is that they're going to put an InfoWars bumper sticker
[05:58:19.230 --> 05:58:20.191]  Somewhere near the bomb.
[05:58:20.872 --> 05:58:35.571]  And then, I thought, as soon as the Saudi National was arrested, that now they've got all the time in the world to go to his apartment and plant all the evidence that, oh, he's an Alex Jones fan, he's an InfoWars listener, he's got, you know, bumper stickers, whatever.
[05:58:35.811 --> 05:58:37.994]  They've got all the time in the world to do that right now.
[05:58:38.976 --> 05:58:48.561]  Now, finally, the big game in all of this may be that they want an excuse to allow the TSA to be on the streets at all sporting events.
[05:58:49.161 --> 05:58:53.683]  So this could be the justification to roll out the TSA and even give them guns.
[05:58:54.024 --> 05:59:07.230]  Now, give them the 2 billion rounds of hollow point .40 caliber ammo, arm those people up, put them on the streets in front of sports stadiums and sporting events and marathons and high school dances, you name it, and they'll say, what?
[05:59:07.770 --> 05:59:08.811]  And they've already beta tested
[05:59:08.951 --> 05:59:12.615]  We're suddenly seeing troops at kite festivals here in Austin, TSA, checkpoints.
[05:59:12.655 --> 05:59:18.941]  And here, I want to say this to the establishment neocons trying to, you know, they see the numbers, trying to quote, take over the libertarian movement.
[05:59:19.361 --> 05:59:25.147]  I'm all for you being a big part of it and being ten times bigger than I am, but don't be a Judas Iscariot.
[05:59:25.567 --> 05:59:26.708]  Don't try to sell us out.
[05:59:26.969 --> 05:59:31.993]  So in case you are just really stupid and not evil, I want to explain something to neocons like Glenn Beck, okay?
[05:59:32.013 --> 05:59:33.175]  I want to explain it very slowly to you.
[05:59:33.985 --> 05:59:45.336]  Every drama, every sitcom, every news show says right-winger gun owners are going to merge with Al-Qaeda and start doing IED, improvised explosive devices, out of the blue.
[05:59:45.857 --> 05:59:51.382]  I've watched for 20 years, 17, almost 18 on air, that they pre-program before something.
[05:59:51.442 --> 05:59:51.943]  It's like
[05:59:53.032 --> 05:59:54.633]  I mean, it's like reading the TV Guide.
[05:59:55.113 --> 06:00:01.815]  And so, that's why I went on air today and said, I think they're going to... I said at the end of the first hour... It was before all this happened.
[06:00:01.835 --> 06:00:03.015]  It's on record, folks.
[06:00:03.375 --> 06:00:04.156]  I'm not bragging.
[06:00:04.216 --> 06:00:08.957]  It shows, we're not saying Batman will be connected to the next shootings after it happens.
[06:00:09.297 --> 06:00:14.719]  I said months before, Batman is clearly a programming trigger and that it was implicated in both shootings.
[06:00:15.580 --> 06:00:17.940]  And the media's like, why do they obsess about Batman?
[06:00:18.641 --> 06:00:19.261]  I see them.
[06:00:19.821 --> 06:00:24.125]  I know I have a gut feeling that's thousands of data points coming in, okay?
[06:00:24.165 --> 06:00:25.126]  I know what I'm talking about.
[06:00:25.306 --> 06:00:26.347]  But a lot of this is simple.
[06:00:27.127 --> 06:00:29.910]  Before 9-11, they said, Bin Laden's about to attack you.
[06:00:30.370 --> 06:00:31.911]  Give up all your rights when he attacks.
[06:00:32.812 --> 06:00:33.072]  Okay?
[06:00:33.112 --> 06:00:34.754]  Then I read their own manuals that were public.
[06:00:34.974 --> 06:00:37.776]  They were always about going after right-wingers and gun owners and veterans.
[06:00:38.097 --> 06:00:40.439]  So I said, they're gonna demonize this one day and flip it.
[06:00:40.719 --> 06:00:41.439]  Now that happened.
[06:00:41.780 --> 06:00:43.161]  I mean, this is like 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[06:00:43.601 --> 06:00:43.881]  And so,
[06:00:44.986 --> 06:00:47.389]  I want to say to everybody out there, we're risking our lives.
[06:00:47.429 --> 06:00:48.169]  Mike Adams is.
[06:00:48.290 --> 06:00:48.550]  I am.
[06:00:48.890 --> 06:00:49.371]  My crew.
[06:00:49.591 --> 06:00:51.593]  This is not a frickin' game, okay?
[06:00:51.993 --> 06:00:53.996]  That's what I want to get out to the neocons and people.
[06:00:54.516 --> 06:00:54.856]  Okay?
[06:00:55.137 --> 06:00:57.099]  This isn't a stinkin' game, man!
[06:00:57.739 --> 06:01:02.765]  They've got their Democratic operatives calling for us to be put in FEMA camps and have our guns taken.
[06:01:03.265 --> 06:01:05.808]  Okay, you can go out and ask Democrats how you want to arrest everybody.
[06:01:06.128 --> 06:01:07.129]  They'll say, hell yeah.
[06:01:08.052 --> 06:01:10.174]  This is the type of stuff that I'm talking about.
[06:01:10.474 --> 06:01:12.196]  This is the type of stuff that I'm debating.
[06:01:12.476 --> 06:01:14.097]  This is the type of stuff that we're going over.
[06:01:14.157 --> 06:01:31.512]  So, when I get up here and say, this could be a false flag, don't you dare twist it and say that I'm 100% saying it's a false flag, and then saying, and then using a typo Watson sent out, you know, where it sounds like we're using bad English to say, don't FBI, you know, you know, you know, involved in every event.
[06:01:31.812 --> 06:01:37.376]  When we're looking at the New York Times having to admit, my God, there's over a hundred of these things.
[06:01:37.396 --> 06:01:38.817]  They use an example of three.
[06:01:39.317 --> 06:01:54.527]  So my point is, if someone has a history of this, if they have a motive to power grab from it, I mean, the first head of Homeland Security, Tom Ridge, four years ago, wrote a book admitting he was ordered to issue fake terror alerts to take people's rights and to distract.
[06:01:54.587 --> 06:01:55.768]  OK, we're right.
[06:01:55.848 --> 06:01:57.009]  You're wrong, Glenn Beck.
[06:01:57.229 --> 06:01:58.470]  Let me tell you something, Glenn Beck.
[06:01:58.690 --> 06:02:00.351]  They may tell you that you're their buddy.
[06:02:00.611 --> 06:02:01.492]  They're going to protect you.
[06:02:02.332 --> 06:02:05.775]  If you play ball and all this stuff, which I think is going on, let me explain something to you, bud.
[06:02:06.115 --> 06:02:12.540]  You even figured it out before you left Fox and said, look at these Democratic letters about how they're going to blame the Patriot movement for the next attack.
[06:02:13.221 --> 06:02:21.206]  Buddy, you've got the power along with others to turn this around, but you've got to not attack people that say we've got to look at this as a false flag.
[06:02:21.467 --> 06:02:22.808]  You'd have to have a lobotomy.
[06:02:23.368 --> 06:02:26.091]  To not know this is the season for this, okay?
[06:02:26.471 --> 06:02:29.114]  I said today, look for it to happen imminent.
[06:02:29.595 --> 06:02:29.915]  Okay?
[06:02:30.015 --> 06:02:30.676]  In my gut.
[06:02:30.776 --> 06:02:32.318]  Mike Adams, final five minutes.
[06:02:32.358 --> 06:02:33.179]  I know I'm ranting.
[06:02:33.199 --> 06:02:34.820]  Uh, and, uh...
[06:02:35.640 --> 06:02:40.021]  Well, look at the logic here of how they could pull this off in terms of blaming patriots.
[06:02:40.701 --> 06:02:49.083]  Using the Sandy Hook logic, every person who owns a firearm is guilty of the Sandy Hook crime, even if they weren't there and had nothing to do with it.
[06:02:49.464 --> 06:02:50.664]  Well, they could use the same thing here.
[06:02:50.704 --> 06:02:58.306]  Let's say they take this Saudi national and they start to label him a patriot or a Tea Party member, and then they plant enough evidence to make that convincing.
[06:02:58.346 --> 06:02:59.066]  It's not difficult.
[06:02:59.666 --> 06:03:02.367]  Then they can say, well, gee, well, all patriots
[06:03:02.967 --> 06:03:06.630]  All Tea Party members are guilty of the Boston bombing.
[06:03:06.670 --> 06:03:16.557]  I know it makes no sense, it's completely irrational, but this has been the logic, or the illogic, of the left, of the socialists, of the communist control system.
[06:03:16.978 --> 06:03:26.005]  So they could very easily do that, and then they could use this as a leverage point to pass more laws, to say, well, gee, you can't be trusted with backpacks.
[06:03:26.425 --> 06:03:27.606]  You know, we gotta have TSA on the streets.
[06:03:27.626 --> 06:03:29.707]  No, no, no, it's all about making us all prisoners.
[06:03:30.108 --> 06:03:32.069]  By the way, Dan Badani was just on Fox News.
[06:03:32.089 --> 06:03:34.271]  He's at the press conference on Fox News.
[06:03:34.291 --> 06:03:39.394]  Our auxiliary reporter, who again was missing his family.
[06:03:39.414 --> 06:03:40.575]  That happens to a lot of the reporters.
[06:03:40.635 --> 06:03:44.438]  It's like, you know, they actually come down here, but have to leave their wife and kids up in another state.
[06:03:45.298 --> 06:03:48.799]  But, you know, Dan still does auxiliary reporting for us, and he's up there.
[06:03:48.839 --> 06:03:49.859]  He's at the press conference.
[06:03:49.899 --> 06:03:53.680]  His question, asking the mayor about the drills, went out on Fox News.
[06:03:55.341 --> 06:03:58.181]  So devastatingly good job by Badandi.
[06:03:58.221 --> 06:04:04.503]  Tell Badandi if he's on our line, because he's going to come up next with Jakari and the guys, because they're coming in.
[06:04:05.723 --> 06:04:08.164]  Tell Badandi, keep asking his questions in the press conference.
[06:04:08.504 --> 06:04:10.244]  He can come on later, or just whatever.
[06:04:10.504 --> 06:04:13.365]  I don't want to pull him out of there if he's already there.
[06:04:14.790 --> 06:04:16.331]  Man, I tell you, I'm going to be exhausted.
[06:04:16.371 --> 06:04:18.033]  I'm on coast-to-coast AM tomorrow night.
[06:04:20.234 --> 06:04:27.140]  Obama is on in six minutes and we'll use that as a break to bring in Jakari Jackson and David Knight.
[06:04:27.200 --> 06:04:28.941]  And again, I just want to commend the entire crew.
[06:04:30.109 --> 06:04:31.330]  Mike Adams, I'm sorry I keep interrupting.
[06:04:31.350 --> 06:04:32.070]  This is just incredible.
[06:04:32.090 --> 06:04:33.451]  We've got Infowars.com forward slash listen.
[06:04:45.419 --> 06:04:47.961]  Has the live video feed of us right now.
[06:04:48.041 --> 06:04:52.284]  Please send that on your Twitter, Facebook, the power of the people to counter the establishment.
[06:04:52.564 --> 06:04:57.567]  And I'll be back live at 7 o'clock for InfoWars Nightly News with all the latest data.
[06:04:57.968 --> 06:05:00.009]  Mike Adams, go ahead and you have the floor.
[06:05:00.329 --> 06:05:09.796]  Take us up to the press conference of Obama, who opposes our savior, our daddy-in-chief, as Chris Rock has said, in T-minus five minutes.
[06:05:10.444 --> 06:05:24.067]  All right, some final thoughts, guys, and just break in when the press conference starts, but over the next few hours, what you're going to see is an attempt by the mainstream media to scrub all the reports that contradict their developing narrative.
[06:05:24.567 --> 06:05:33.469]  So right now, you can go to this story on, what is it, local15tv.com, where a University of Mobile
[06:05:35.609 --> 06:05:44.975]  A cross-country coach says that bomb-sniffing dogs were there at the start lines, at the finish line, and that when the explosions happened, the police there just said, don't worry about it, it's a drill.
[06:05:45.515 --> 06:05:46.856]  That story is up right now.
[06:05:47.296 --> 06:05:49.998]  It will be scrubbed within the next few hours.
[06:05:50.518 --> 06:05:54.801]  And this is going to happen across Twitter, across Facebook, across the web.
[06:05:54.821 --> 06:06:03.366]  So what's crucial right now is to make sure that you start screen capturing all of these things before they get scrubbed, so that we can piece together the real narrative
[06:06:04.026 --> 06:06:05.427]  By the way, I agree.
[06:06:05.467 --> 06:06:09.530]  They've now shut everyone's cell phones off, saying cell phones could detonate bombs.
[06:06:09.771 --> 06:06:15.115]  So now they have an excuse to shut down our cell phones citywide to control stories.
[06:06:15.175 --> 06:06:16.596]  I mean, I'm sorry, this is just incredible.
[06:06:16.616 --> 06:06:17.176]  It's absurd.
[06:06:17.396 --> 06:06:19.478]  You can't detonate a bomb with a cell phone.
[06:06:20.479 --> 06:06:22.641]  It's an absurd idea, and you're right.
[06:06:22.661 --> 06:06:24.423]  They're doing it so that people can't text out.
[06:06:24.463 --> 06:06:29.650]  No, I mean, you can call a number that then, and then use that phone that then sends an order to detonate.
[06:06:29.670 --> 06:06:31.171]  Yeah, if you set it up and you know the number, yeah.
[06:06:31.251 --> 06:06:35.737]  But just random people using cell phones is not gonna, you know, detonate a bomb.
[06:06:35.757 --> 06:06:37.979]  And besides, who's detonating the bomb?
[06:06:38.560 --> 06:06:39.942]  It's the Boston Bomb Squad.
[06:06:41.304 --> 06:06:42.424]  That's who's out there doing the detonation.
[06:06:42.444 --> 06:06:43.725]  But again, people are trying to spin it.
[06:06:43.785 --> 06:06:44.885]  Oh, there's always bomb dogs.
[06:06:45.125 --> 06:06:49.886]  They were announcing, everyone be calm, everything's fine, around the areas where the bombs went off.
[06:06:50.786 --> 06:07:03.869]  And the fact that they're not making this a bigger issue, if they didn't stage it, or are people involved with them, they would be going, oh, our great bomb squad was on it, trying to stop it, racing against the time.
[06:07:04.189 --> 06:07:05.629]  Instead, they don't want to discuss this.
[06:07:06.633 --> 06:07:13.482]  Yeah, and it makes you wonder, you know, the excuse they've used to not cover the abortion murderer trial to say, oh, it's just a local crime story.
[06:07:14.083 --> 06:07:15.685]  Well, they're not using that here.
[06:07:15.825 --> 06:07:18.969]  This is a local crime story, but they're covering it.
[06:07:19.369 --> 06:07:21.692]  So it just goes to show you, everything's selective, including
[06:07:22.333 --> 06:07:26.256]  As David Knight said in the previous segment, it's selective about who it's okay to kill.
[06:07:26.896 --> 06:07:43.469]  So, if you're a leftist, it's okay to kill babies, it's okay to kill, even up to the age of three, it's okay to kill them in post-birth abortions, but then suddenly it's not okay to kill them when they become cute children in elementary school, but then after that, it's okay to kill them again if they're patriots.
[06:07:43.949 --> 06:07:45.530]  Or senior citizens with the death panel.
[06:07:45.550 --> 06:07:51.114]  So we have all this selective, all these contradictions out there from the leftist philosophy.
[06:07:51.514 --> 06:07:52.575]  And it's very, very dangerous.
[06:07:52.615 --> 06:07:54.476]  We are headed into a super dangerous time.
[06:07:54.996 --> 06:07:59.980]  I believe that we all need to really watch carefully.
[06:08:00.040 --> 06:08:07.385]  I don't want to... And by the way, we're not up here on air saying this is all crazy, because it's... I mean, we're physically ill up here at the office.
[06:08:07.445 --> 06:08:09.506]  I mean, this is real.
[06:08:09.546 --> 06:08:11.467]  This is not our spin on this.
[06:08:12.788 --> 06:08:23.357]  It is freaking over the top when the state police of Colorado come out last week and go, we're in meetings where the feds are saying prepare to take all the guns from Christians and basically mass arrest us.
[06:08:23.437 --> 06:08:32.444]  I mean, this would be like if they said we're preparing to arrest all the Jews, we're preparing to arrest all the Muslims, we're preparing to... I mean, this is incredible.
[06:08:33.137 --> 06:08:34.157]  Yeah, absolutely.
[06:08:34.277 --> 06:08:36.178]  And here's the thing, this may be only the beginning.
[06:08:36.218 --> 06:08:38.699]  They may have more bombs in other cities, so think about that.
[06:08:38.719 --> 06:08:44.761]  By the way, they launched the first mass casualty tablet device during the marathon.
[06:08:44.781 --> 06:08:46.142]  Let me read that headline again to people.
[06:08:46.162 --> 06:08:47.482]  I am just devastated here.
[06:08:48.122 --> 06:08:51.263]  Boston deployed mass casualty tablet device during marathon.
[06:08:51.824 --> 06:08:53.724]  The EMS, they had it all ready.
[06:08:53.764 --> 06:08:55.525]  My God, they rolled this sucker out.
[06:08:55.985 --> 06:09:03.750]  And they used a drill to do it, and probably only had like two guys plant the bombs, and the cops and people don't even... Again, Mike, I know you've studied false flags.
[06:09:04.070 --> 06:09:07.052]  Explain to people why they do drills over the false flags.
[06:09:07.793 --> 06:09:13.717]  Well, that way people don't think that the explosion is real, and that way all the local police can stand down.
[06:09:14.177 --> 06:09:21.602]  So, they say it's going to be a drill, then if anybody knows in advance that it's going to happen, like a police officer,
[06:09:22.734 --> 06:09:26.617]  Then they just, the excuse is, oh well, I was just told it was going to be part of a drill.
[06:09:26.637 --> 06:09:27.818]  I didn't know there was going to be a real bomb.
[06:09:27.838 --> 06:09:29.099]  So it gives them a cover, basically.
[06:09:29.139 --> 06:09:41.930]  And notice how it's perfect scripting, where it happens during the day, builds up, then we get answers, then Obama, he comes out at 6 o'clock, 610 Eastern, 510, 515 Central, and he comes out and he's going to comfort everybody.
[06:09:42.410 --> 06:09:42.570]  Sure.
[06:10:00.017 --> 06:10:01.118]  What are they going to do about us?
[06:10:01.178 --> 06:10:03.540]  Because more people listen to us than ever.
[06:10:03.841 --> 06:10:12.229]  They listen to Matt Drudge at DrudgeReport.com, NaturalNews.com, WorldNetDaily, and then meanwhile Beck is always in the middle trying to shut us down.
[06:10:12.269 --> 06:10:13.049]  What do you make of him?
[06:10:13.790 --> 06:10:15.271]  I don't know what Beck's deal is.
[06:10:15.432 --> 06:10:18.494]  I've had no interaction with Beck whatsoever.
[06:10:18.514 --> 06:10:20.837]  Wouldn't it be satisfying to see him stop being a PUD?
[06:10:21.517 --> 06:10:22.658]  Yeah, sure.
[06:10:22.998 --> 06:10:33.625]  But, you know, the bottom line is, Alex, we can't really even be concerned with little people like Beck who, you know, they think they have an audience, but their audience is mostly asleep, so it hardly even counts.
[06:10:34.026 --> 06:10:37.628]  Your audience is awake, so they have consciousness, they have intelligence.
[06:10:37.668 --> 06:10:38.889]  Well, no, we're not just saying that!
[06:10:39.349 --> 06:10:40.430]  We drive the news.
[06:10:40.810 --> 06:10:41.851]  Okay, here's Obama.
[06:10:41.891 --> 06:10:43.713]  Mike, we're going to get more updates from you soon.
[06:10:43.733 --> 06:10:44.574]  I know you're very busy.
[06:10:44.614 --> 06:10:45.555]  Naturalnews.com.
[06:10:45.795 --> 06:10:47.676]  Here is our king, our master, our ruler.
[06:10:47.757 --> 06:10:48.197]  Our people.
[06:10:48.277 --> 06:10:48.998]  Kim Jong-un.
[06:10:49.038 --> 06:10:49.458]  Here he is.
[06:10:49.718 --> 06:10:53.422]  Security around the United States is necessary and investigate what happened.
[06:10:53.442 --> 06:10:54.002]  Oh, security.
[06:10:54.022 --> 06:10:54.603]  You mean police state.
[06:10:54.623 --> 06:10:56.765]  The American people will say a prayer for Boston tonight.
[06:10:57.665 --> 06:11:00.148]  And Michelle and I send our deepest thoughts and prayers.
[06:11:00.768 --> 06:11:01.889]  To the families of the victims.
[06:11:17.117 --> 06:11:25.440]  FBI Director Mueller and Secretary of Homeland Security Napolitano, and they're mobilizing people with resources to investigate and to respond.
[06:11:25.500 --> 06:11:31.982]  I've updated leaders of Congress in both parties, and we reaffirmed that on days like this, there are no Republicans or Democrats.
[06:11:32.202 --> 06:11:35.823]  We are Americans, united in concern for our fellow citizens.
[06:11:36.857 --> 06:11:47.121]  I've also spoken with Governor Patrick and Mayor Menino and made it clear that they have every single federal resource necessary to care for the victims and counsel the families.
[06:11:47.721 --> 06:11:52.122]  And above all, I made clear to them that all Americans stand with the people of Boston.
[06:11:53.483 --> 06:12:02.366]  Boston police, firefighters, and first responders, as well as the National Guard, responded heroically and continue to do so as we speak.
[06:12:03.348 --> 06:12:12.312]  It's a reminder that so many Americans serve and sacrifice on our behalf every single day, without regard to their own safety, in dangerous and difficult circumstances.
[06:12:12.632 --> 06:12:18.855]  And we salute all those who assisted in responding so quickly and professionally to this tragedy.
[06:12:20.136 --> 06:12:23.197]  We still do not know who did this or why.
[06:12:24.017 --> 06:12:27.039]  And people shouldn't jump to conclusions before we have all the facts.
[06:12:27.955 --> 06:12:31.176]  But, make no mistake, we will get to the bottom of this.
[06:12:31.857 --> 06:12:35.758]  And we will find out who did this, we'll find out why they did this.
[06:12:36.579 --> 06:12:44.022]  Any responsible individuals, any responsible groups, will feel the full weight of justice.
[06:12:45.472 --> 06:12:48.494]  Today is a holiday in Massachusetts, Patriots Day.
[06:12:49.355 --> 06:12:58.481]  It's a day that celebrates the free and fiercely independent spirit that this great American city of Boston has reflected from the earliest days of our nation.
[06:12:58.881 --> 06:13:04.064]  And it's a day that draws the world to Boston's streets in a spirit of friendly competition.
[06:13:05.045 --> 06:13:07.347]  Boston is a tough and resilient town.
[06:13:08.147 --> 06:13:08.868]  So are its people.
[06:13:09.890 --> 06:13:16.693]  I'm supremely confident that Bostonians will pull together, take care of each other, and move forward as one proud city.
[06:13:16.733 --> 06:13:21.735]  And as they do, the American people will be with them every single step of the way.
[06:13:22.655 --> 06:13:29.238]  You should anticipate that as we get more information, our teams will provide you briefings.
[06:13:30.338 --> 06:13:39.262]  We're still in the investigation stage at this point, but I just want to reiterate, we will find out who did this, and we will hold them accountable.
[06:13:40.256 --> 06:13:42.117]  Thank you very much.
[06:14:04.622 --> 06:14:09.124]  There's their fortunes and their sacred honor because they valued liberty above security.
[06:14:09.184 --> 06:14:13.366]  And history has shown us that only those types of people ever have any security.
[06:14:14.527 --> 06:14:18.248]  So I was very surprised when we just saw that statement by Obama.
[06:14:18.288 --> 06:14:23.611]  We heard Joe Biden earlier saying, you know, bombings, you know, we have bombings and bombs on the ground.
[06:14:23.651 --> 06:14:27.793]  And Obama gave that pretty bland, nondescript statement.
[06:14:28.809 --> 06:14:37.693]  So I'm trying to figure out why they would have, you know, something Joe Biden said off the cuff was a little more strong than what Obama had to say right there in his statement.
[06:14:37.753 --> 06:14:38.374]  Yeah, yeah.
[06:14:39.154 --> 06:14:39.874]  That's pretty amazing.
[06:14:39.894 --> 06:14:46.338]  I guess, too, I was kind of amazed to see Glenn Beck hop on this and start criticizing Alex right away.
[06:14:46.358 --> 06:14:53.301]  You know, we've got an article here and some of you may have seen our earlier piece here where Peter Bergen
[06:14:54.159 --> 06:14:59.868]  Uh, jumped on this today and he automatically started going after right-wingers, blaming this bombing on the right-wingers.
[06:14:59.928 --> 06:15:00.990]  But, you know, he had started on this.
[06:15:01.150 --> 06:15:03.033]  I've got an article right here, it's up on the document cam.
[06:15:03.413 --> 06:15:06.498]  It started this back in April the 4th, okay?
[06:15:06.638 --> 06:15:07.800]  About 10 days ago, 10-11 days ago.
[06:15:09.342 --> 06:15:13.683]  And basically talking about the growing threat of extreme right-wing violence.
[06:15:13.883 --> 06:15:19.764]  And what he tries to do is make a case that it's right-wing terrorism that we really got to be afraid of.
[06:15:20.284 --> 06:15:26.885]  And what he talks about, he says there's 15 right-wing terrorists indicted in 2012, six involved in one incident.
[06:15:27.185 --> 06:15:34.387]  And then he goes, by comparison in 2012, only six people who subscribe to al-Qaeda's ideology were indicted on terrorism-related charges in the U.S.
[06:15:35.373 --> 06:15:48.435]  I have to ask myself, if we've got that few people, both domestic, let's say, and in his terminology, right-wing, and Al-Qaeda, why do we have this gigantic monstrosity called the Homeland Security?
[06:15:48.475 --> 06:15:51.136]  I mean, how many billions or tens of billions?
[06:15:51.156 --> 06:15:58.597]  They're switching it over to your homegrown terrorists, as they like to call them, people who are concerned about liberty and have don't tread on me flags.
[06:15:58.617 --> 06:16:00.238]  Those are the new threats.
[06:16:00.318 --> 06:16:02.078]  Yeah, that's been the narrative for the last couple of months.
[06:16:02.938 --> 06:16:21.731]  But when you just go back and look at how few, I mean, even on his data, he's trying to make a big case out of, you know, oh, there's a dozen here and 10 here, and you've got that few, then you can very easily, if you've got that small a database, that small a number, it's very easy to say, look, you know, it jumped 25%, you know, when it goes from four to five, you know?
[06:16:22.051 --> 06:16:32.478]  So you can really get people, you've got such a small group there, such a small number, it really doesn't make any sense to talk about developing trends there because these are essentially isolated incidences.
[06:16:33.398 --> 06:16:39.340]  When you look at the TSA and how well it's been documented, how ineffective they are.
[06:16:39.740 --> 06:16:53.485]  When you have the congressman, the Republican congressman from Florida talking about how he regrets it and how he can't put out, he's not allowed to put out the figures as to how small they are because, you know, we all wouldn't believe it, the people that they're actually able, you know, their success rate.
[06:16:53.846 --> 06:17:00.288]  Because they run tests through where they actually have agents with bombs run through there and they virtually never catch these guys.
[06:17:00.748 --> 06:17:13.258]  So when you look at that, you have to say, well, if they're not catching the guys that are a test, and we're not having any incidences for the last 12 years, then essentially, you know, there's not any threat.
[06:17:13.778 --> 06:17:14.779]  And that's what he's saying here.
[06:17:15.399 --> 06:17:17.401]  We all know, yeah, there is no Al-Qaeda threat.
[06:17:17.981 --> 06:17:21.563]  So now what they're trying to do, though, is they're trying to manufacture a domestic threat.
[06:17:21.603 --> 06:17:24.245]  And Peter Bergen and CNN are part of that.
[06:17:24.505 --> 06:17:31.170]  Peter Bergen, another Brit, you know, he was actually born in the U.S., I think, to British parents, but he grew up in England and came back to the U.S.
[06:17:31.590 --> 06:17:36.393]  So here's another guy who is their CNN security analyst, I think is what they call him here.
[06:17:36.413 --> 06:17:42.577]  Yeah, CNN's national security analyst is Peter Bergen, and he is ready to jump...
[06:17:44.258 --> 06:17:48.259]  Glenn Beck is criticizing Alex Jones for saying, you know, we need to look at government here.
[06:17:48.279 --> 06:17:50.660]  I'm not surprised about that at all.
[06:17:50.700 --> 06:17:57.442]  Right, but we actually do have a reason to look at government because of this report of the drill this morning, okay?
[06:17:57.482 --> 06:17:59.563]  That is, like we've talked about, that's fingerprints all over it.
[06:18:00.223 --> 06:18:11.936]  Yeah, and that's the thing, they'll jump on Alex, not just people such as Beck, but other people have demonized Alex for being, I guess you could say, the first responder to call these things what they are.
[06:18:12.276 --> 06:18:19.223]  And nobody's saying we have definitive evidence at the moment, but you just look at the telltale signs, they just happened to be running a drill that day.
[06:18:19.283 --> 06:18:20.244]  I mean, what's that about?
[06:18:20.845 --> 06:18:21.866]  And it's not just that.
[06:18:21.906 --> 06:18:24.748]  It's not an isolated incident like we said in our last segment.
[06:18:25.129 --> 06:18:28.111]  Oklahoma City, the 7-7 bombings, and the list goes on from there.
[06:18:28.432 --> 06:18:33.216]  They just happened to be running a drill about the exact same scenario that they encountered on that day.
[06:18:33.236 --> 06:18:37.299]  So yeah, it's not a smoking gun evidence, but it's something that I think is worth pointing out.
[06:18:37.319 --> 06:18:39.121]  Oh yeah, especially because we've seen that over and over again.
[06:18:39.461 --> 06:18:42.524]  Let me just mention one more thing from this Peter Bergen thing before we move on.
[06:18:42.544 --> 06:18:48.209]  And that is, further down he says, talking about these different plots and jihad terrorism, he says,
[06:18:48.889 --> 06:18:51.710]  Seven of these are leftists or animal rights extremists.
[06:18:51.730 --> 06:19:03.075]  For instance, three are participating in Occupy Chicago, a leftist political movement, and were indicted on terrorism charges last June for plotting to throw Molotov cocktails at President Obama and other officials during a NATO summit in Chicago.
[06:19:03.635 --> 06:19:12.119]  Their lawyers, now here's what's interesting, their lawyers say an undercover government agent had urged them to plot the attacks and build firebombs.
[06:19:12.699 --> 06:19:21.868]  Now that's exactly what we're talking about, you know, and we say that that's what you see on both the quote-unquote left-wing terrorists, the al-Qaeda terrorists, as well as right-wing terrorists.
[06:19:22.409 --> 06:19:24.411]  And New York Times has reported this.
[06:19:24.671 --> 06:19:28.595]  CNN's Peter Bergen, their national security analyst, is reporting the fact.
[06:19:28.976 --> 06:19:32.419]  But, you know, if we talk about the fact that the government has over and over again
[06:19:33.180 --> 06:19:41.143]  Not only instigated these things, but in many cases they were the ones who carried it out, a lot of times with the help of one or two patsies.
[06:19:41.924 --> 06:19:52.028]  But it's usually the FBI, you hear the same pattern just like we talked about the drills, it's also the same pattern that you see the FBI coming into a group and saying, hey guys, you know what we need to do?
[06:19:52.068 --> 06:19:54.789]  We need to go attack these people and here's how we do it.
[06:19:54.809 --> 06:19:55.929]  But they don't know how to do it.
[06:19:59.311 --> 06:20:09.156]  We keep referencing the Oklahoma City bombing, but in the film The Noble Lie, there's a guy who says that, you know, whenever you have three people talking about blowing up the government, two of them work for the government.
[06:20:10.437 --> 06:20:10.837]  That's right.
[06:20:11.118 --> 06:20:12.779]  We see that over and over and over again.
[06:20:12.959 --> 06:20:20.203]  And we should keep talking about the Oklahoma City bombing, because it is a pattern that they continue to use the same method of operation.
[06:20:20.683 --> 06:20:30.870]  In terms of, you know, from the initial genesis of the threat, and carrying out the threat, as well as these drills that take place at exactly the same time, in exactly the same way.
[06:20:31.390 --> 06:20:42.178]  So, you know, Peter Bergen talks about this, he talks about the fact that the government has been involved in developing these things with Patsy's, and yet, when we point it out, we're bad guys.
[06:20:42.498 --> 06:20:42.618]  Yeah.
[06:20:42.718 --> 06:20:48.742]  If he jumps to the conclusion and says, you know, they're right-wing terrorists, he's not a bad guy.
[06:20:48.802 --> 06:20:54.125]  But if Alex Jones says, you know, we see a drill that's happening here, then we're bad guys.
[06:20:54.266 --> 06:20:54.746]  Exactly.
[06:20:55.646 --> 06:20:56.807]  You can't point out the obvious.
[06:20:56.847 --> 06:20:57.388]  Yeah, yeah.
[06:20:57.848 --> 06:21:02.511]  And of course, you know, criticized not just by, well, I guess Glenn Beck really is mainstream.
[06:21:02.551 --> 06:21:04.212]  I mean, he's kind of Fox News.
[06:21:04.252 --> 06:21:10.076]  But, you know, saying, you know, not just by the mainstream media, but by The Blaze, you know, criticizing us for doing that.
[06:21:11.232 --> 06:21:16.615]  Follow the story wherever it goes, and we're not really afraid to be labeled as such.
[06:21:16.715 --> 06:21:21.438]  I mean, if you run out there and you say, run down the street, hey, this is what it is, then you're the crazy guy.
[06:21:21.478 --> 06:21:25.340]  But, you know, a lot of these people will come around and say, OK, maybe there was something to that.
[06:21:25.380 --> 06:21:29.042]  So they can, you know, jump on the bandwagon at a later date and time.
[06:21:29.082 --> 06:21:36.427]  But meanwhile, I believe Dan Badondi was at a press conference up there in Boston, and I believe he had a chance.
[06:21:36.507 --> 06:21:38.308]  I believe it was the governor he asked a question to.
[06:21:38.968 --> 06:21:39.449]  Oh, the mayor.
[06:21:39.789 --> 06:21:43.272]  The mayor of Boston about why they were running a drill that day.
[06:21:43.312 --> 06:21:44.614]  Now, I'm not sure if we have that video.
[06:21:44.654 --> 06:21:45.855]  I'm pretty sure we don't have the video.
[06:21:46.396 --> 06:21:47.056]  We don't have the video.
[06:21:47.076 --> 06:21:47.857]  We're working on the video.
[06:21:47.877 --> 06:21:49.839]  They may have it ready for the nightly news.
[06:21:50.179 --> 06:21:51.721]  But do we know what the mayor's response was?
[06:21:51.761 --> 06:21:52.402]  Does anybody know?
[06:21:53.783 --> 06:21:54.083]  Okay.
[06:21:54.203 --> 06:21:55.465]  Well, we're still working on that, but...
[06:21:57.093 --> 06:22:01.094]  But it was on major news channels, he got to ask that question on national television.
[06:22:01.114 --> 06:22:05.035]  So, at the very least, congratulations Dan, you're getting the real story out there.
[06:22:05.215 --> 06:22:19.500]  Well, and along with that, and I think Alex just covered this, on April 12th, Firehouse.com reported that Boston, this is three days ago, that Boston was going to deploy mass casualty tablet device during the marathon.
[06:22:20.080 --> 06:22:28.166]  Says Boston EMS is deploying a new off-the-shelf, lightweight mobile device for the first time at the Boston Marathon on April 15th.
[06:22:28.626 --> 06:22:44.838]  The platform from SafetyPad is intended for use in mass casualty situations, and it gives EMS personnel the ability to carry into crowds and assess a patient upon arrival, document it in real time, transmit data to transport units before they arrive, and other features.
[06:22:44.898 --> 06:22:46.239]  That's interesting.
[06:22:46.259 --> 06:22:49.181]  That is very interesting.
[06:22:49.201 --> 06:22:52.503]  And they just deployed it.
[06:22:52.543 --> 06:22:54.384]  Maybe just a coincidence.
[06:22:54.584 --> 06:22:55.765]  They just deployed it today.
[06:22:55.985 --> 06:22:56.165]  Yeah.
[06:22:56.405 --> 06:22:57.846]  Just deployed today for the first time ever.
[06:22:58.386 --> 06:22:58.546]  Ever.
[06:22:58.846 --> 06:22:59.007]  Ever.
[06:22:59.347 --> 06:22:59.507]  Yeah.
[06:23:01.928 --> 06:23:02.229]  I don't know.
[06:23:02.269 --> 06:23:07.612]  Well, you know, one of the things we were talking about, these false flags and drills and stuff, I remember
[06:23:08.777 --> 06:23:18.585]  Gore Vidal saying that he knew, in his opinion, 9-11 was a false flag because his father had been involved with building out NORAD.
[06:23:18.866 --> 06:23:26.672]  His father was a pioneer in aviation and involved very high-level military and he said he had basically founded it and designed it.
[06:23:27.293 --> 06:23:30.495]  And his question the whole time that was happening was, where's NORAD?
[06:23:31.196 --> 06:23:32.457]  Why is NORAD standing down?
[06:23:33.323 --> 06:23:38.905]  And then when he found out they were having a drill and they were making people stand down and so forth and so on, that's when he called BS.
[06:23:39.225 --> 06:23:39.645]  Yeah.
[06:23:39.725 --> 06:23:40.645]  On the whole 9-11 thing.
[06:23:40.925 --> 06:23:57.690]  I mean it's just, any common sense argument, we have so many groups out there saying they want common sense this and common sense that, but when you look at these tragedies, we'll just talk about 9-11 since you brought it up, common sense question, why do we only have one, not even a video, one set of
[06:23:58.470 --> 06:24:01.212]  But one camera showing you the image of what struck the Pentagon.
[06:24:01.653 --> 06:24:11.481]  In a sense, I mean, are we to believe that the Pentagon, one of the most secure structures, above ground structures on the planet Earth, has one eyeable camera?
[06:24:11.541 --> 06:24:13.763]  Well, you could still see the parts of the wall that were still standing.
[06:24:13.783 --> 06:24:15.545]  You'd see the cameras all along.
[06:24:16.894 --> 06:24:18.957]  And speaking of common sense, I think we have a new clip.
[06:24:18.977 --> 06:24:20.840]  Do you think that we can pass those?
[06:24:20.960 --> 06:24:27.890]  And just very briefly, to your last question, what's the efficacy of banning these magazine clips?
[06:24:28.250 --> 06:24:32.156]  I will tell you, these are ammunition.
[06:24:32.316 --> 06:24:32.917]  They're bullets.
[06:24:33.297 --> 06:24:36.878]  So, the people who have those now, they're going to shoot them.
[06:24:37.278 --> 06:24:50.401]  And so, if you ban them in the future, the number of these high-capacity magazines is going to decrease dramatically over time because the bullets will have been shot and there won't be any more available.
[06:24:50.461 --> 06:24:53.682]  Like you said, so this lady is pretty much claiming, what's her name?
[06:24:53.742 --> 06:24:54.662]  I forget what her name was.
[06:24:54.742 --> 06:24:56.203]  These magazine clips, they're bullets.
[06:24:57.293 --> 06:25:02.616]  A Colorado Democrat who's, I guess she believes that you discharge your magazine.
[06:25:02.636 --> 06:25:05.357]  Well, she said at the beginning, these magazine clips, they're bullets.
[06:25:06.858 --> 06:25:10.199]  So I guess, you know, you shoot them off, you shoot off these magazine clips and that's it.
[06:25:10.219 --> 06:25:12.881]  Yeah, let's just shoot off all the magazine clips and we won't shoot any more.
[06:25:12.921 --> 06:25:16.262]  Who was that that said they had a hundred round, they had a hundred clip magazine?
[06:25:16.282 --> 06:25:17.643]  Okay, you can see.
[06:25:17.663 --> 06:25:18.523]  That was Biden, wasn't it?
[06:25:18.863 --> 06:25:20.224]  No, it wasn't Biden, it was somebody else.
[06:25:20.484 --> 06:25:21.405]  That was, who was that?
[06:25:22.785 --> 06:25:29.647]  Diana DeGette, if you're watching on Infowars.com forward slash listen, you can see her picture right there.
[06:25:29.987 --> 06:25:32.648]  But no, somebody came up, it was on Infowars the other day, maybe you guys can pull it up.
[06:25:32.988 --> 06:25:36.249]  Somebody said they had a hundred round, no, it had a hundred clip magazine.
[06:25:36.269 --> 06:25:36.669]  Yeah.
[06:25:36.909 --> 06:25:37.649]  I can't remember who it was.
[06:25:37.709 --> 06:25:40.890]  I think it was a Curt Nimmo article came out Thursday or Friday or so.
[06:25:41.610 --> 06:25:53.012]  And it just goes to show that these people, Harry Reid, these people have no idea of what they're actually, they don't even know, they've made themselves afraid of something, they don't even know what it is.
[06:25:53.792 --> 06:25:58.733]  You know, it's like they scare themselves, like, I don't know what's on this piece of paper, but I'm sure it's something that's going to shock me to death.
[06:25:59.613 --> 06:26:02.694]  And these are the people who are, you know, running policy.
[06:26:03.394 --> 06:26:07.174]  I mean, that's a segue to get back on the Boston issue.
[06:26:07.534 --> 06:26:10.375]  We see that the man is a Saudi, was he Saudi national?
[06:26:11.215 --> 06:26:11.975]  That's what they're reporting.
[06:26:12.355 --> 06:26:18.076]  So, I'm wondering, you know, if they're going to try to tie this guy into some type of right-wing extremist group?
[06:26:18.096 --> 06:26:19.056]  Well, yeah, and that was a thing.
[06:26:19.256 --> 06:26:20.277]  What was it?
[06:26:20.557 --> 06:26:29.358]  Was that a West Point narrative where he was talking about some kind of a war game scenario where they said that the Al-Qaeda joined up with a right-wing terrorist?
[06:26:29.418 --> 06:26:32.199]  Yeah, I mean, I was joking with the guys in the back.
[06:26:32.259 --> 06:26:33.339]  I said, watch this guy.
[06:26:33.379 --> 06:26:35.559]  This Saudi national is going to have a don't tread on me tattoo.
[06:26:36.399 --> 06:26:39.480]  You know, he's going to take a mug shot with a John Deere hat.
[06:26:40.121 --> 06:26:45.100]  And they're just going to say, oh yeah, we got Saudis working with the right-wingers.
[06:26:47.104 --> 06:26:53.089]  And it's not even that, it's just that if you have a Don't Tread On Me flag, tattoo or whatever, now you're some type of extremist.
[06:26:53.109 --> 06:26:57.133]  You're part of some type of hate group or some type of violent organization.
[06:26:57.733 --> 06:26:58.574]  Because they say so.
[06:26:59.014 --> 06:27:10.264]  Because they show all the people in the TV shows who are militiamen or have Don't Tread On Me tattoos as the terrorists and the child molesters and whatever else they want to push the agenda on.
[06:27:10.544 --> 06:27:11.005]  Absolutely.
[06:27:11.664 --> 06:27:15.966]  And that's what we've got to worry about, is how they're going to use this to go after guns.
[06:27:16.747 --> 06:27:21.449]  As Alex was just saying, you know, all of this is being driven by fear and paranoia.
[06:27:21.909 --> 06:27:26.812]  And all the people who are coming after this, now they're going to be clamoring for even more protection from the government.
[06:27:26.872 --> 06:27:29.213]  And that's what Obama is offering in his speech.
[06:27:29.253 --> 06:27:30.634]  We're going to keep you safe, you know.
[06:27:31.134 --> 06:27:33.015]  Yeah, he's doing a great job, isn't he?
[06:27:33.175 --> 06:27:35.957]  You know, giving guns to Mexican drug cartels, which
[06:27:36.557 --> 06:27:50.108]  And I wonder this, you know, and we didn't have a chance to speak to any of the people at the last rally about this topic, but I just wonder how many of these moms against X, Y, and Z know that their government is funding the exact same thing that they're fighting against.
[06:27:50.328 --> 06:27:50.768]  Absolutely.
[06:27:50.948 --> 06:27:58.875]  The man who, you know, you jump up and stand behind and rah, rah, rah, I'm with Barack Obama and Joe Biden because they're anti-gun.
[06:27:59.475 --> 06:28:02.438]  These people, these same people gave guns to Mexican drug cartels.
[06:28:02.458 --> 06:28:04.300]  They keep talking about background checks.
[06:28:04.360 --> 06:28:06.061]  I mean, they knew these guys were criminals.
[06:28:06.201 --> 06:28:08.403]  Well, the New York Times called that a false flag attack.
[06:28:08.423 --> 06:28:12.027]  The New York Times said that was set up to demonize the Second Amendment.
[06:28:12.747 --> 06:28:16.351]  But it was more than that, because the whole thrust of the U.N.
[06:28:16.391 --> 06:28:22.677]  Arms Trade Treaty, as well as the Fast and Furious, was about the flow of arms across borders.
[06:28:23.617 --> 06:28:27.319]  And why do you stop the flow of arms across borders according to the UN?
[06:28:27.739 --> 06:28:32.062]  Well, you register and identify the owners and the objects.
[06:28:32.602 --> 06:28:32.902]  Okay?
[06:28:33.262 --> 06:28:35.684]  And that's what this has all been about from the very beginning.
[06:28:36.284 --> 06:28:48.771]  And I believe that Fast and Furious, as the New York Times said, a false flag attack, it was set up not just in general to demonize the Second Amendment, but specifically to push for registration.
[06:28:49.131 --> 06:28:49.331]  Mm-hmm.
[06:29:01.980 --> 06:29:11.308]  In the, uh, at the U.N., and, uh, they could not, they didn't get any traction from the Aurora shooting that was, uh, a Friday that, and the following Friday they were going to have the vote.
[06:29:11.809 --> 06:29:17.914]  Well, they could tell by the middle of the week, uh, by Wednesday, before that Friday, they knew they weren't getting any traction from it.
[06:29:18.335 --> 06:29:23.159]  And they abruptly pulled out and said, we'll, we'll handle this later, okay, in the year after the election.
[06:29:23.719 --> 06:29:27.924]  And so they were set up to handle this in the lame duck session after the election.
[06:29:27.944 --> 06:29:29.726]  They actually, the U.N.
[06:29:29.806 --> 06:29:32.970]  met on the same day that we were having our domestic election here.
[06:29:33.911 --> 06:29:38.275]  And it was clear that the Democrats were going to gain seats in the Senate and that Obama was going to get reelected.
[06:29:38.516 --> 06:29:44.663]  And what they did was they announced, I think it was about eight hours after our election was over, they announced that they were going to
[06:29:45.363 --> 06:29:47.605]  Not do anything right away, not in the lame duck session.
[06:29:47.665 --> 06:29:49.267]  No, they were going to wait until March.
[06:29:49.647 --> 06:29:52.309]  That would give them some time to get these new senators in.
[06:29:52.730 --> 06:29:59.636]  And then in the meantime, you know, shortly after that, about six weeks after that, five or six weeks after that, they had the Sandy Hook shooting.
[06:30:00.116 --> 06:30:08.924]  Okay, so they've been using all of this and I believe that, you know, they're getting more and more open about the confiscation and outright gun ban, which is
[06:30:09.384 --> 06:30:12.946]  You know, what we caught Martina saying at that rally here in Austin.
[06:30:13.246 --> 06:30:18.909]  And there's more and more talk about that, like Bill Maher and everybody are openly talking about just gutting the Second Amendment.
[06:30:19.529 --> 06:30:23.531]  But right now, and I believe what they've been after all along, is registration.
[06:30:23.731 --> 06:30:32.915]  Expanding that database, getting more detailed information on gun owners, and creating more legal tripwires so they can arrest gun owners.
[06:30:34.396 --> 06:30:39.018]  Now, I do believe we have a couple clips from the President, so you guys can fire when ready there.
[06:30:41.954 --> 06:30:42.775]  Okay, here's a bridge.
[06:30:43.395 --> 06:30:47.738]  When y'all go home and you're talking to your buddies and they say, ah, he wants to take my gun away.
[06:30:49.659 --> 06:30:52.081]  You heard it here, I'm on television so everybody knows it.
[06:30:53.802 --> 06:30:55.023]  I believe in the Second Amendment.
[06:30:56.564 --> 06:30:59.646]  I believe in people's lawful right to bear arms.
[06:31:00.427 --> 06:31:02.428]  I will not take your shotgun away.
[06:31:02.949 --> 06:31:04.730]  I will not take your rifle away.
[06:31:04.750 --> 06:31:07.792]  I won't take your handgun away.
[06:31:08.877 --> 06:31:10.281]  Okay, we have another one coming up here.
[06:31:17.134 --> 06:31:22.198]  Less than $250,000 a year will see any form of tax increase.
[06:31:22.639 --> 06:31:29.304]  Not your income tax, not your payroll tax, not your capital gains taxes, not any of your taxes.
[06:31:29.945 --> 06:31:30.905]  Didn't all those go up?
[06:31:31.186 --> 06:31:32.447]  Yeah, every single one of them.
[06:31:32.467 --> 06:31:40.073]  Well, I want to talk about registration, and people will see events like this, and I mean, I've heard people say this even before the bombings today.
[06:31:40.113 --> 06:31:44.497]  We have what appears to be a homemade explosive device, and people would say that
[06:31:45.845 --> 06:31:52.249]  If you want to ban guns after Sandy Hook, you can still go to the store and buy stuff at your local grocery store to make a bomb.
[06:31:52.689 --> 06:31:57.151]  And people think it's such a ridiculous notion that you would ban something that you could buy at the store, but they already do.
[06:31:57.572 --> 06:32:01.754]  They ban things like pseudoephedrine that's used to make methamphetamines.
[06:32:02.294 --> 06:32:04.335]  People think that it's it's so far-fetched.
[06:32:04.355 --> 06:32:24.721]  I mean they're they're saying that you can't go buy XYZ medicine or you can't have we seen the the Bureau of Justice statistics if somebody comes in and they buys a certain amount of ammonia or certain amount of matches or whatever else and then you're supposed to report them and it's kind of that scenario that the guys did in the crew video where Alex was playing the the grocery store guy and
[06:32:24.981 --> 06:32:26.602]  He's out there following the guy.
[06:32:27.123 --> 06:32:27.904]  That's real.
[06:32:27.984 --> 06:32:31.106]  I mean, that's not something that's going to happen or could happen.
[06:32:31.126 --> 06:32:32.808]  That happens right now, today.
[06:32:33.208 --> 06:32:39.493]  So the notion that they may ban a certain amount of lighter fluid or whatever it may be is a very real notion.
[06:32:39.753 --> 06:32:40.034]  Oh yeah.
[06:32:40.274 --> 06:32:40.854]  Oh, absolutely.
[06:32:41.255 --> 06:32:42.676]  There's no telling what they're going to ban.
[06:32:44.297 --> 06:32:46.399]  Okay, we got something really frightening coming up here.
[06:32:46.439 --> 06:32:47.199]  Jon Bowne's telling us.
[06:32:47.239 --> 06:32:47.980]  What you got, Jon?
[06:32:54.833 --> 06:32:55.934]  This is a commercial here.
[06:32:57.656 --> 06:32:59.678]  Pillsbury Doughboy going through TSA.
[06:32:59.738 --> 06:33:00.619]  I'll get it together.
[06:33:01.019 --> 06:33:01.500]  I promise.
[06:33:06.064 --> 06:33:08.226]  Ronnie, how happy are folks who save hundreds of dollars?
[06:33:08.246 --> 06:33:10.329]  No, I won't hear that part.
[06:33:10.349 --> 06:33:11.069]  Isn't that nice?
[06:33:11.089 --> 06:33:13.692]  That's the Doughboy going through a TSA checkpoint.
[06:33:13.752 --> 06:33:17.536]  Yeah, and the friendly TSA man poking him there.
[06:33:20.667 --> 06:33:29.130]  Yeah, so if you're listening, we just saw a clip of the Pillsbury Doughboy, and you guys may have seen these GEICO commercials.
[06:33:29.150 --> 06:33:42.234]  They do the witch and the broom factory and the bodybuilder directing traffic, and the new one is the Pillsbury Doughboy going through a TSA checkpoint where he is repeatedly touched and prodded.
[06:33:42.314 --> 06:33:46.295]  And he giggles and likes it, because that's what the Pillsbury Doughboy is all about.
[06:33:46.335 --> 06:33:47.816]  But you know, we've got those friendly
[06:33:48.516 --> 06:33:52.600]  TSA agents and you know, nothing to be alarmed about here kiddies.
[06:33:52.620 --> 06:33:55.523]  Let's just remember the Pillsbury Doughboy.
[06:33:55.603 --> 06:33:58.305]  He gets poked and prodded by the TSA when he travels.
[06:33:58.345 --> 06:34:00.287]  So, you know, Junior, why shouldn't you?
[06:34:00.327 --> 06:34:01.128]  You know, don't cry.
[06:34:02.009 --> 06:34:02.970]  He's having a good time.
[06:34:03.010 --> 06:34:04.271]  He doesn't want to get out the line.
[06:34:04.411 --> 06:34:05.292]  You're not being molested.
[06:34:05.592 --> 06:34:08.555]  You know, this is the new normal and that really is scary.
[06:34:08.695 --> 06:34:12.178]  Okay, so when it goes from being the Doughboy to being your son, we'll see.
[06:34:13.240 --> 06:34:16.424]  I think I've had my last Pillsbury products there for a while.
[06:34:16.484 --> 06:34:16.785]  Yeah.
[06:34:16.805 --> 06:34:18.467]  I've been trying to lay off that stuff anyway.
[06:34:18.587 --> 06:34:22.453]  It's funny because we keep talking about, or at least I've made a stand since
[06:34:24.071 --> 06:34:29.213]  The man to plan videos with all the movie stars who go out and you know Jamie Foxx and so on.
[06:34:29.633 --> 06:34:32.975]  And I made a stand like I have not watched a movie from anybody in that video.
[06:34:33.015 --> 06:34:38.697]  Actually I was going to see a movie with Steve Carell, the identity thief I think it was.
[06:34:39.198 --> 06:34:44.000]  And then I was sitting in the movie theater and it clicked and oh Steve Carell and I was like I need to go watch something else.
[06:34:44.060 --> 06:34:45.621]  Go and watch something else.
[06:34:45.641 --> 06:34:49.342]  Well you know you're talking about that and that was Mayors Against Illegal Guns.
[06:34:49.902 --> 06:34:50.863]  Now think about that.
[06:34:51.463 --> 06:34:52.084]  Illegal guns.
[06:34:52.144 --> 06:35:06.019]  Now, you know, we talked, you and I talked for quite some time to Art Acevedo, the police chief here in Austin, who spoke at that rally in Austin a week ago last Saturday, and he kept saying over and over again, I don't want to take guns away.
[06:35:06.039 --> 06:35:09.463]  I only want to keep them out of the hands of bad people, okay?
[06:35:10.270 --> 06:35:16.314]  But, if you're going to talk about illegal guns, you're not talking about the character of the people having guns.
[06:35:16.515 --> 06:35:19.597]  You're now focused on the gun, not on somebody being a criminal.
[06:35:20.598 --> 06:35:31.045]  And so, at the same time we heard that clip from Obama saying, I support the Second Amendment, I am so sick and tired of being lied to by these people.
[06:35:31.145 --> 06:35:38.811]  They are so cynical at the same time they're trying to ban guns, and then they talk about guns being illegal, they say they support the Second Amendment.
[06:35:39.051 --> 06:35:39.451]  You can't.
[06:35:39.671 --> 06:35:43.274]  When you call something an illegal gun, you've just banned it.
[06:35:44.254 --> 06:35:45.995]  If it's an illegal drug, it's banned.
[06:35:46.055 --> 06:35:46.916]  It's a banned drug.
[06:35:46.956 --> 06:35:51.759]  Just like Martinez told the guy, there is no current gun ban in effect.
[06:35:51.799 --> 06:35:55.401]  Well, Feinstein has a list of over 100 she wants to ban.
[06:35:55.441 --> 06:36:03.105]  They're saying you can't have this type of gun because it has military characteristics or X, Y, and Z. I mean, there is a current gun ban.
[06:36:03.826 --> 06:36:05.947]  Here's Austin City Council Member Mike Martinez.
[06:36:08.373 --> 06:36:11.117]  Thank you so much.
[06:36:11.157 --> 06:36:17.145]  I've got a proclamation on behalf of the Mayor and City Council that we want to present, but I want to say a couple of words, and I'll be brief.
[06:36:17.926 --> 06:36:24.135]  First of all, to the gentleman that's dying for attention, someone needs to inform him that there is no gun ban currently.
[06:36:27.662 --> 06:36:32.345]  The work that we're doing here today, we will make your sign legitimate shortly.
[06:36:32.505 --> 06:36:34.186]  So you hang onto that.
[06:36:57.021 --> 06:36:57.522]  We're good to go.
[06:37:14.545 --> 06:37:27.097]  So many people at that rally, we don't have it in that shot, but you can see the lady behind him and there's a whole circle behind Martina as the guest speakers who kept saying, we don't want to take away guns, we just want reasonable restrictions.
[06:37:27.577 --> 06:37:35.405]  Yet, when he says, I'm going to make your sign legitimate that says stop the gun ban, meaning he's going to make the gun ban legitimate, people jump up and cheer.
[06:37:35.925 --> 06:37:45.511]  And the other thing too, Jakari, when we were there, and we've got a clip of it, I don't know if they've got it pulled up here, but as the gentleman is standing there with his sign, they're surrounding him.
[06:37:45.872 --> 06:37:51.435]  They got in front of him, they got in back of him, they put their signs up in front of his sign so nobody would be able to see his sign.
[06:37:51.475 --> 06:37:53.817]  He stepped over to the side, they stepped over to the side.
[06:37:53.857 --> 06:37:55.137]  He steps back, they step back.
[06:37:55.177 --> 06:37:58.580]  They're shadowing him back and forth, almost knocked over his grandson doing it.
[06:37:58.980 --> 06:38:03.623]  But these are people who have no respect for freedom of speech either.
[06:38:04.023 --> 06:38:05.304]  Yeah, play that Holder clip.
[06:38:05.724 --> 06:38:07.624]  Let's play that Holder clip.
[06:38:11.546 --> 06:38:24.371]  Speaking of that guy, when he was at the rally, he and his grandson and the other gentleman, I don't know if he was with him or not, there was an incident where somebody in the crowd started yelling obscenities at the guy because Martinez took
[06:38:25.771 --> 06:38:29.913]  Just change the way in which people think about guns, especially young people.
[06:38:30.053 --> 06:38:35.816]  One thing that I think is clear with young people and with adults as well is that we just have to be repetitive about this.
[06:38:35.876 --> 06:38:40.499]  It's not enough to simply have a catchy ad on a Monday and then only do it every Monday.
[06:38:40.559 --> 06:38:47.442]  We need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[06:38:47.822 --> 06:39:00.025]  Yeah, and I'll make this point and then we can get back to the to the matter at hand in Boston, but we saw in the Mike Martinez when he was at the rally speaking to the guy and he directly addresses them.
[06:39:00.065 --> 06:39:06.447]  Hey you guys down here you guy with the sign and the guy the taller gentleman addresses him back has some things to say.
[06:39:06.827 --> 06:39:12.853]  And then some guy, some younger guy, he's probably, you know, late 20s or so, starts yelling and screaming at the two guys.
[06:39:13.333 --> 06:39:20.099]  And then the police swarm in, Acevedo included, and they stand behind the guys with the sign as if they're causing the disturbance.
[06:39:20.439 --> 06:39:23.382]  These guys, yeah, you can see them right here on your screen.
[06:39:23.402 --> 06:39:27.646]  We'll let that video play for those watching on Infowars.com.
[06:39:28.026 --> 06:39:30.909]  We will make your sign legitimate shortly.
[06:39:31.009 --> 06:39:32.811]  So you hang on to that.
[06:39:35.109 --> 06:39:36.270]  Okay, yeah.
[06:39:36.390 --> 06:39:37.951]  It didn't go all the way to the clip, but that's okay.
[06:39:38.051 --> 06:39:38.831]  It's not in that video.
[06:39:39.011 --> 06:39:46.596]  You know, they had a couple of people, there were signs talking about the analogy of registering guns to the analogy of registering vehicles, that sort of thing.
[06:39:46.656 --> 06:39:47.977]  That is not the analogy.
[06:39:48.237 --> 06:39:55.581]  The analogy is that, you know, owning a car, whatever, we can argue that it should be protected, and I would argue that.
[06:39:55.601 --> 06:40:03.126]  I would say that we wouldn't have most of the activity that happens on the highways happening today if the founders had had cars.
[06:40:03.886 --> 06:40:14.393]  I don't think it ever occurred to them that anybody would try to regulate their travel in the way that we have our travel regulated today, but putting that aside, the real analogy is between the First Amendment and the Second Amendment.
[06:40:14.433 --> 06:40:19.536]  The First Amendment says they'll make no law abridging free speech or free exercise of religion.
[06:40:19.816 --> 06:40:21.678]  The second one says you shall not infringe.
[06:40:22.038 --> 06:40:24.339]  Those are essentially the same, okay?
[06:40:24.379 --> 06:40:27.902]  They're drawing absolute protections around those two rights.
[06:40:28.402 --> 06:40:37.333]  The only difference being that they realized that the Second Amendment would be attacked incrementally by a gradual process of infringement.
[06:40:37.393 --> 06:40:39.195]  And that's exactly what we've seen.
[06:40:39.235 --> 06:40:46.704]  We've seen what was once a fundamental right, we've seen that gradually being turned into a government-granted privilege.
[06:40:47.585 --> 06:40:49.086]  All this registration stuff is about.
[06:40:49.406 --> 06:40:59.912]  And so if you want to make an analogy, the way to make an analogy about this would be to say that we're going to take people, you're going to have to have government permission before you can say anything on the internet.
[06:41:00.132 --> 06:41:03.934]  Or you're going to have to have government permission before you can open up a radio program.
[06:41:03.954 --> 06:41:08.156]  Or you're going to have to be licensed by the government for a radio program, because after all,
[06:41:08.795 --> 06:41:17.622]  Broadcasting is a far more powerful means of communication than those primitive printing presses that they had back in the 18th century, right?
[06:41:17.642 --> 06:41:19.584]  I mean, that's the argument that they make against us.
[06:41:19.604 --> 06:41:21.085]  They say, oh, well, they only had muskets.
[06:41:21.105 --> 06:41:21.525]  Well, you know what?
[06:41:21.925 --> 06:41:30.252]  Muskets were the state-of-the-art military devices then, and when they came after the Patriots in Concord and Trenton, they came to take a cannon.
[06:41:30.652 --> 06:41:36.942]  Just like Santa Ana went to Gonzales to take a cannon.
[06:41:36.982 --> 06:41:37.883]  They said, come and take it.
[06:41:38.084 --> 06:41:38.745]  Give us your cannon.
[06:41:38.865 --> 06:41:39.526]  Give up your cannon.
[06:41:39.546 --> 06:41:40.908]  They said, come and take it if you can.
[06:41:44.534 --> 06:41:46.416]  It's the state-of-the-art military device.
[06:41:46.837 --> 06:41:57.531]  In ancient England, they would let the yeomanry have a longbow, but they wouldn't let them have a crossbow because that was going to go through armor, and that was really more of a state-of-the-art.
[06:41:57.571 --> 06:42:01.035]  And so today what you have is you've got retired General McChrystal
[06:42:01.716 --> 06:42:13.326]  Going around shopping his book and going on CNN and Fox and all the mainstream media talking about how, you know, military bullets and military rifles should not be in the hands of individuals.
[06:42:13.446 --> 06:42:14.907]  Well, by and large, they're not.
[06:42:15.047 --> 06:42:18.970]  The average thing that you can buy at the sporting goods store is not a military gravestone.
[06:42:19.010 --> 06:42:19.951]  It just looks like one.
[06:42:20.011 --> 06:42:20.371]  That's right.
[06:42:20.672 --> 06:42:27.958]  And yet, in Switzerland, people are not only trained on these things, but they keep the state-of-the-art military weapons in their home because
[06:42:28.698 --> 06:42:29.178]  They're set up.
[06:42:29.218 --> 06:42:31.240]  Well, we've got Dan Bodondi on the line.
[06:42:31.260 --> 06:42:31.860]  Let's talk to him.
[06:42:31.880 --> 06:42:33.722]  We want to find out what happened at that press conference.
[06:42:35.163 --> 06:42:39.726]  Hey guys, we just had a press conference with the mayor of Boston and also Patrick DeVos.
[06:42:41.948 --> 06:42:44.650]  They're basically not giving too much information.
[06:42:45.431 --> 06:42:48.173]  I asked them about that exercise they had this morning.
[06:42:48.513 --> 06:42:53.476]  They said it's normal routine, but we can't get into that right now.
[06:42:54.277 --> 06:42:55.138]  They said it's routine?
[06:42:56.860 --> 06:42:58.181]  Yeah, routine for an event.
[06:42:58.401 --> 06:43:00.203]  They said that's a routine thing for an event.
[06:43:00.243 --> 06:43:03.987]  They have bomb-stuffing dogs and all that, which sounds a little peculiar to me.
[06:43:09.232 --> 06:43:14.093]  And I'm talking to some athletes, participants in the Boston Marathon.
[06:43:14.133 --> 06:43:16.374]  Some heard the explosion.
[06:43:16.394 --> 06:43:18.275]  A lot of them just got pulled off their run.
[06:43:18.295 --> 06:43:20.535]  The next thing you know, there's cops over there pulling them off the track.
[06:43:21.276 --> 06:43:23.456]  And they're told they can't finish the race.
[06:43:23.576 --> 06:43:28.018]  And the ones I've given to you so far that witnessed, they said it was just like a wild boom.
[06:43:28.098 --> 06:43:32.739]  Everybody that witnessed it said the first one they thought it was just something, a firework or whatever.
[06:43:33.179 --> 06:43:35.900]  And when they heard the second one go off, they knew something was wrong.
[06:43:36.660 --> 06:43:41.302]  And now there's military and police and SWAT team all going around the city.
[06:43:41.343 --> 06:43:42.623]  I was following with the camera here.
[06:43:43.043 --> 06:43:52.428]  They're going through little alleyways, checking people's cars and RVs and vans and just seeing what a bunch of SWAT team members who have fully automatic weapons and they're searching the entire city.
[06:43:53.379 --> 06:43:55.340]  You said they're checking people's cars.
[06:43:55.400 --> 06:43:56.681]  Are they running checkpoints?
[06:43:56.721 --> 06:43:57.621]  Are they pulling people over?
[06:43:57.961 --> 06:43:58.482]  How's it happening?
[06:44:11.568 --> 06:44:13.650]  Wow, you're saying they can't leave their hotels.
[06:44:13.830 --> 06:44:14.090]  Curfew.
[06:44:40.037 --> 06:44:40.358]  Wow.
[06:44:40.999 --> 06:44:41.480]  Curfew.
[06:44:41.601 --> 06:44:42.423]  Curfew in Boston.
[06:44:42.443 --> 06:44:43.846]  Do you see a lot of military there?
[06:44:43.886 --> 06:44:45.830]  Or is it mainly just SWAT police?
[06:44:45.870 --> 06:44:47.233]  Or can't you even tell the difference anymore?
[06:44:49.104 --> 06:44:58.548]  There's the National Guard here, there's FEMA, which again is the Massachusetts region of FEMA, and you know, all the kind of, there's the U.N.C.E.A.P.F.
[06:44:58.568 --> 06:45:03.731]  here as well, FBI, I mean, some other federal agencies, I mean, there are women around here.
[06:45:04.391 --> 06:45:07.713]  And we're blocked off from the actual site where the bombs went off.
[06:45:07.753 --> 06:45:10.454]  They blocked off at least two blocks from me or anywhere near there.
[06:45:10.914 --> 06:45:16.657]  And when I went in, I got resistance from the police, so they were pretty hostile since I even went near the area.
[06:45:17.310 --> 06:45:17.610]  Mm-hmm.
[06:45:17.630 --> 06:45:21.753]  Okay, so are you aware of any other upcoming press conferences in the area?
[06:45:24.455 --> 06:45:25.916]  Do you know about any other press conference?
[06:45:25.956 --> 06:45:27.377]  Will there be any other press conferences?
[06:45:28.129 --> 06:45:28.289]  Right.
[06:45:28.309 --> 06:45:28.509]  If ever.
[06:45:50.600 --> 06:45:50.900]  Okay.
[06:45:51.721 --> 06:45:52.282]  Alright, Dan.
[06:45:53.924 --> 06:45:57.147]  Stay safe out there and yeah, any information you can get.
[06:45:57.607 --> 06:46:04.915]  And if you do have a chance to ask any of the athletes, maybe, you know, do they have bomb sniffing dogs at their other races that they go to?
[06:46:04.935 --> 06:46:06.757]  Absolutely.
[06:46:07.738 --> 06:46:07.878]  Yeah.
[06:46:08.533 --> 06:46:14.677]  Well you know, Dan, when we heard this reported, what we heard was that it was going to be a bomb drill.
[06:46:29.767 --> 06:46:34.508]  And that's different from taking dogs around and looking for bombs ahead of time, right?
[06:46:35.108 --> 06:46:35.528]  I would think.
[06:46:35.568 --> 06:46:36.609]  Wouldn't you think so, Jagrar?
[06:46:36.649 --> 06:46:37.089]  I think so.
[06:46:37.129 --> 06:46:40.010]  Like, when you have a... I mean, it's a drill, like a fire drill.
[06:46:40.030 --> 06:46:43.490]  You know, you have the kids right outside and, you know, whatever the situation may be.
[06:46:43.651 --> 06:46:43.851]  Right.
[06:46:43.891 --> 06:46:48.112]  In a drill, you're basically, essentially pretending that there's something there, right?
[06:46:48.212 --> 06:46:54.553]  As opposed to a routine inspection where you're going around with dogs looking for something, as I'm sure that they would do at an event.
[06:46:54.613 --> 06:46:55.533]  So, all right.
[06:46:55.554 --> 06:46:56.814]  We'll keep watching that.
[06:46:59.048 --> 06:46:59.648]  Uh huh, right, right.
[06:46:59.668 --> 06:46:59.888]  Okay.
[06:47:00.209 --> 06:47:01.189]  Well, great job, Dan.
[06:47:01.209 --> 06:47:02.109]  Okay, stay in touch, Dan.
[06:47:22.432 --> 06:47:22.853]  Appreciate it.
[06:47:22.953 --> 06:47:23.193]  Thanks.
[06:47:41.215 --> 06:47:41.715]  We're good to go.
[06:47:58.787 --> 06:48:01.568]  Some stuff about the 7-7 bombing.
[06:48:01.588 --> 06:48:03.668]  There's an online YouTube video about that.
[06:48:03.688 --> 06:48:04.628]  It's about a minute long.
[06:48:05.029 --> 06:48:15.371]  Also another one about NORAD that actually ABC News did that was about two and a half minutes long where they talk about the fact that they actually had these exact drills going on and what an amazing thing.
[06:48:15.431 --> 06:48:18.672]  What an amazing coincidence it was that just keeps happening over and over again.
[06:48:18.812 --> 06:48:21.032]  The article just was on the screen a second ago.
[06:48:21.092 --> 06:48:22.233]  It said a drill.
[06:48:22.593 --> 06:48:22.853]  So
[06:48:23.593 --> 06:48:24.754]  Yeah, I do agree with you.
[06:48:24.794 --> 06:48:33.884]  It probably is standard procedure for any big event, you know, to bring out the dogs and what have you, but like you said, there's standard procedure, then there's an actual drill.
[06:48:34.165 --> 06:48:34.365]  Right.
[06:48:34.745 --> 06:48:38.189]  So we'll definitely try to look more into that and, you know, find out what we can.
[06:48:38.409 --> 06:48:38.970]  Yeah, yeah.
[06:48:38.990 --> 06:48:41.032]  If you guys could find that YouTube video about
[06:48:42.153 --> 06:48:45.894]  The 7-7 bombings, it's only about a minute long, and the guy talks about that.
[06:48:45.954 --> 06:48:51.656]  They had that exact same scenario going on at the exact same time that those bombs went off.
[06:48:51.696 --> 06:48:54.036]  And the same thing happened again on 9-11.
[06:48:54.096 --> 06:49:00.838]  So, that was the thing that, to me, raised a really red flag, because we've seen that happen so many times before.
[06:49:02.739 --> 06:49:08.880]  Okay, there's a picture from the conference of the mayor fielding some questions there.
[06:49:08.900 --> 06:49:09.821]  Okay.
[06:49:13.078 --> 06:49:13.819]  What happens?
[06:49:13.939 --> 06:49:14.960]  Are we open for calls?
[06:49:15.200 --> 06:49:16.020]  Can we take any calls?
[06:49:18.643 --> 06:49:22.586]  Alright, we'll start taking calls in a few minutes if you guys want to start queuing up there.
[06:49:23.026 --> 06:49:23.206]  Yeah.
[06:49:24.027 --> 06:49:27.590]  So, in the meantime, David, especially if you've got anybody that's in the area.
[06:49:29.707 --> 06:49:31.669]  Yeah, that's what I was gonna say.
[06:49:31.689 --> 06:49:32.289]  Boston people.
[06:49:32.429 --> 06:49:40.075]  People in the Boston area, if you're on the scene, or if you're one of the people stuck in your hotel, or you're one of the kids, they said, hey, don't leave your dorm room.
[06:49:40.135 --> 06:49:48.442]  If you're in the area, if you're, you know, 50 miles away on the highway, maybe not so much, but if you're in the area, we definitely want to hear from you.
[06:49:50.003 --> 06:49:57.789]  So in the meantime, David, we talked about the TSA and how they could definitely have stricter sanctions on people's mobility.
[06:49:57.809 --> 06:49:59.591]  Do you think anything else could arise from this?
[06:50:00.311 --> 06:50:01.372]  I think we're definitely going to see that.
[06:50:01.632 --> 06:50:03.794]  I think we have Alex Jones on deck.
[06:50:04.334 --> 06:50:07.557]  Guys, I've ordered some pizzas and stuff for the crew.
[06:50:07.577 --> 06:50:16.624]  The larger issue here that I just want to throw in real quick is they are in there on Fox going this is America's new 9-11.
[06:50:18.012 --> 06:50:22.178]  And now people may get behind the president on his gun control and immigration.
[06:50:22.818 --> 06:50:25.902]  See, just like 9-11, they got Patriot Act, all this other stuff through.
[06:50:26.423 --> 06:50:27.444]  That was a government operation.
[06:50:27.825 --> 06:50:30.328]  I start thinking about this, the anthrax, all of it.
[06:50:30.869 --> 06:50:33.693]  We'd be crazy to not look at them as the number one culprits.
[06:50:34.942 --> 06:50:36.303]  But gentlemen, continue.
[06:50:37.103 --> 06:50:40.245]  Great job with Badandi, you know, getting it out on the news.
[06:50:41.025 --> 06:50:43.086]  And have we given the number out to take calls?
[06:50:43.607 --> 06:50:45.027]  We're about to get ready for calls.
[06:50:45.047 --> 06:50:46.808]  We're just trying to get set up for calls.
[06:50:46.968 --> 06:50:47.589]  Absolutely.
[06:50:48.229 --> 06:50:50.430]  Because that's a key during an event like this.
[06:50:50.870 --> 06:50:53.231]  I'm the worst at not taking calls because I can talk and talk and talk.
[06:50:53.612 --> 06:50:54.992]  The toll-free number is right down there.
[06:50:55.293 --> 06:50:56.233]  Have we opened it up yet?
[06:50:56.533 --> 06:50:57.474]  They're still trying to get the call.
[06:50:57.494 --> 06:50:57.854]  I guess we can
[06:50:58.942 --> 06:50:59.182]  Okay.
[06:50:59.482 --> 06:50:59.962]  What did he say?
[06:51:00.022 --> 06:51:01.183]  The Sunday number, is that right?
[06:51:01.243 --> 06:51:02.263]  Yes, it's the Sunday number.
[06:51:02.283 --> 06:51:03.023]  I'm going to give you the number.
[06:51:03.304 --> 06:51:06.285]  The network can only, because they're up in Minnesota, they go through at like 3 o'clock.
[06:51:07.145 --> 06:51:08.205]  So let me just give the number.
[06:51:08.845 --> 06:51:11.326]  It's this one right here, 877-789-ALEX.
[06:51:11.546 --> 06:51:11.766]  Right.
[06:51:11.886 --> 06:51:15.428]  I'm just throwing you guys in the deep end hosting the show here.
[06:51:15.968 --> 06:51:16.988]  Doing a great job, by the way.
[06:51:19.489 --> 06:51:22.574]  I would just ask people to call 877-789-ALEX.
[06:51:23.695 --> 06:51:25.618]  That's the number, and I take phone calls.
[06:51:26.099 --> 06:51:30.826]  And let's go until 7 o'clock, and then we'll start the nightly news.
[06:51:31.126 --> 06:51:35.753]  And then during the nightly news, if you guys have a 30-minute break, we can go back and forth between the studio feeds.
[06:51:35.973 --> 06:51:36.413]  Okay.
[06:51:36.493 --> 06:51:36.814]  Okay?
[06:51:37.174 --> 06:51:41.037]  So, so I can go for 30 minutes, go to you for 30, maybe another 30, take some calls.
[06:51:41.297 --> 06:51:42.638]  You guys will be the call studio.
[06:51:42.859 --> 06:51:43.099]  Okay.
[06:51:43.119 --> 06:51:44.840]  So let's take, let's take an hour of calls.
[06:51:45.060 --> 06:51:49.264]  People from Boston first or people that saw key media information.
[06:51:49.344 --> 06:51:50.565]  What does the population think?
[06:51:51.311 --> 06:51:56.293]  Okay, so if you guys got the message, we will be calling in on our Sunday call-in line.
[06:51:56.333 --> 06:51:56.753]  That is 877-789-ALEX.
[06:51:56.773 --> 06:51:57.213]  That is Alex's 2539.
[06:51:57.253 --> 06:51:57.553]  877-789-ALEX.
[06:51:57.573 --> 06:52:02.115]  So whenever the guys get ready for the calls, we will definitely start to fill them.
[06:52:10.506 --> 06:52:11.827]  So that's where we said they were going to go.
[06:52:11.847 --> 06:52:13.428]  They're going to treat this as another 9-11.
[06:52:13.768 --> 06:52:15.369]  They're going to step up the police state.
[06:52:15.429 --> 06:52:17.211]  They're going to stomp on our rights.
[06:52:17.291 --> 06:52:21.093]  That Salon article, they said it's for the TSA, and they say it's to take your rights.
[06:52:21.113 --> 06:52:22.274]  Well, they're already admitting that.
[06:52:22.334 --> 06:52:23.835]  I mean, it hasn't been a day.
[06:52:24.175 --> 06:52:28.518]  They're already saying we need more liberties, you know, to keep you safe.
[06:52:28.718 --> 06:52:29.279]  Yeah, yeah.
[06:52:29.819 --> 06:52:30.840]  You know, going back to H.L.
[06:52:31.300 --> 06:52:32.981]  Mencken back in the 1990s.
[06:52:34.202 --> 06:52:34.582]  We're good to go.
[06:52:49.987 --> 06:52:55.971]  That's something that you need their protection for safety and you've got to give up your freedoms and your rights in order to be safe.
[06:52:56.191 --> 06:52:59.133]  Exactly, even look at Hurricane Katrina.
[06:52:59.494 --> 06:53:12.883]  You have people in high and dry areas and you know people who are very safe, people who have firearms to protect themselves, they have plenty of food, but yet the government wants them depended so they go and strip them of their rights to defend themselves.
[06:53:13.043 --> 06:53:14.684]  Yeah, that was one of the most outrageous things.
[06:53:14.744 --> 06:53:16.085]  I mean the fact that they would go door-to-door
[06:53:16.545 --> 06:53:19.829]  Confiscating weapons and tying guys up on the sidewalk.
[06:53:19.869 --> 06:53:27.277]  And the thing about that is, when we hear so many of these people, they say, that will never happen in this country.
[06:53:27.297 --> 06:53:28.038]  It already has.
[06:53:28.118 --> 06:53:29.039]  It already has.
[06:53:29.099 --> 06:53:30.020]  Yeah, it already has.
[06:53:30.040 --> 06:53:30.561]  It already has.
[06:53:31.502 --> 06:53:31.662]  Yeah.
[06:53:32.002 --> 06:53:34.723]  And that's what the Oath Keepers grew out of, was that experience.
[06:53:34.763 --> 06:53:38.965]  Because, you know, a lot of people woke up and said, this is absolutely insane.
[06:53:39.065 --> 06:53:40.026]  And it's gone too far.
[06:53:40.086 --> 06:53:41.506]  And it really has gone too far.
[06:53:41.966 --> 06:53:49.210]  And the point of Stuart Rhodes and the Oath Keepers organization is to say that we need to get together as a group before this gets really dangerous.
[06:53:49.690 --> 06:53:52.211]  We need to get together and we need to say,
[06:53:52.871 --> 06:53:55.652]  That we're going to not comply with this.
[06:53:56.173 --> 06:53:58.934]  And that's the way it ended, tyranny ended, in Eastern Europe.
[06:53:59.174 --> 06:54:05.877]  You know, it ended, they stopped shooting people that were going over the Berlin Wall when the guards just said, that's enough.
[06:54:06.517 --> 06:54:11.019]  I'm not going to kill people on your orders that are doing nothing other than trying to go over a wall.
[06:54:12.040 --> 06:54:12.860]  And that's what it's going to take.
[06:54:12.900 --> 06:54:13.841]  People are going to have to stand up.
[06:54:13.921 --> 06:54:18.443]  And it's not just your everyday citizens, it's going to have to be your police and your military.
[06:54:20.060 --> 06:54:22.503]  Okay, we've got a caller, Robert from South Carolina.
[06:54:22.563 --> 06:54:23.324]  Robert, you're online.
[06:54:23.344 --> 06:54:24.245]  How you doing?
[06:54:24.265 --> 06:54:26.767]  Can you hear us?
[06:54:26.868 --> 06:54:27.969]  I just had a question.
[06:54:27.989 --> 06:54:39.381]  Basically, how come NBC and Fox, and I believe Alex touched on it just a second ago as I was on hold, how come the first thing that they report is, you know, this is America's new 9-11?
[06:54:41.832 --> 06:54:43.333]  I'm not surprised they would do that at all.
[06:54:43.373 --> 06:54:46.735]  Just like we've been talking about what type of liberties are they going to come after next.
[06:54:47.115 --> 06:54:48.116]  Just like this could easily be pushed.
[06:54:48.136 --> 06:54:49.597]  Yeah, I'm not surprised in the least.
[06:54:50.097 --> 06:54:50.858]  Excuse me, Chakari, sir.
[06:54:50.878 --> 06:54:51.258]  No, go ahead.
[06:54:51.278 --> 06:54:51.458]  Go ahead.
[06:54:52.210 --> 06:54:53.670]  But I'm not surprised in the least.
[06:54:53.750 --> 06:55:01.833]  I just think it's funny that, you know, the state-run media, as it's so called, that's the first thing that they go to is, you know, they want to get the people in a frenzy.
[06:55:01.853 --> 06:55:06.274]  It's like, okay, we've got to get them scared all over again just to see what we can get through.
[06:55:06.834 --> 06:55:08.434]  And it's just, it's complete bull.
[06:55:08.554 --> 06:55:11.475]  I mean, people just need to wake up and realize what's going on.
[06:55:11.755 --> 06:55:18.597]  And one more thing, how come the first star that they showed on TV, I believe it was Fox that showed this, Steven Spielberg, what's he doing there?
[06:55:18.939 --> 06:55:19.219]  Really?
[06:55:19.239 --> 06:55:19.859]  I didn't know that.
[06:55:19.879 --> 06:55:20.900]  I didn't see that.
[06:55:20.920 --> 06:55:28.203]  Yes, Peter Spielberg, I swear, he's on, it was about probably 15 minutes ago, he was on Fox News, they showed him, he's helping people off the street.
[06:55:28.904 --> 06:55:33.706]  And the guys are joking, they made me, what was that movie, Wag the Dog, where they had the Hollywood producer make the whole thing.
[06:55:34.146 --> 06:55:36.247]  Yeah, that's pretty much what I was thinking.
[06:55:36.307 --> 06:55:39.588]  Was he live on scene, or was he videoing in, or what was it?
[06:55:39.608 --> 06:55:42.750]  No, he was live on scene, he was helping carry people off the street.
[06:55:43.943 --> 06:55:45.464]  Oh, okay, so he was at the Boston Marathon.
[06:55:45.484 --> 06:55:46.485]  He was actually there, okay.
[06:55:46.765 --> 06:55:56.471]  But the thing is, I tell you, you know, we all know, that's why you mentioned the government media, I mean, they are always blowing the horn for more government involvement in our lives.
[06:55:56.491 --> 06:56:00.173]  And they basically, I mean, just look at the way that they've played Sandy Hook.
[06:56:00.633 --> 06:56:01.694]  Just incessantly.
[06:56:02.234 --> 06:56:03.155]  It is a tragedy.
[06:56:03.735 --> 06:56:11.182]  Okay, but they, as we talked about before, they're very selective about ignoring the tragedies of the children who were killed by predator drone strikes.
[06:56:11.202 --> 06:56:18.849]  They're very selective about ignoring the children who were killed by government action, either deliberate or incompetent at Waco.
[06:56:19.090 --> 06:56:19.390]  Exactly.
[06:56:19.410 --> 06:56:27.878]  Okay, I mean that is, you know, they're very, very selective about what they report and what they continue to talk about and what they immediately can and get silent about.
[06:56:28.358 --> 06:56:28.759]  Exactly.
[06:56:30.953 --> 06:56:31.213]  All right.
[06:56:31.253 --> 06:56:32.535]  Okay, we got another caller on the line.
[06:56:32.555 --> 06:56:33.216]  Appreciate your call.
[06:56:33.296 --> 06:56:33.756]  Who's next?
[06:56:36.339 --> 06:56:36.880]  Who's next, John?
[06:56:37.581 --> 06:56:39.523]  Got a call from California, and what's the first name?
[06:56:40.184 --> 06:56:40.544]  Keith.
[06:56:40.664 --> 06:56:42.146]  Go ahead, Keith.
[06:56:43.112 --> 06:56:44.072]  Hi, this is Keith.
[06:56:44.092 --> 06:56:49.653]  I just wanted to note I saw the leaked pictures of Colin Powell at the Bohemian Grove meeting.
[06:56:50.733 --> 06:56:51.714]  Do you know what date was that?
[06:56:51.754 --> 06:56:54.034]  Like two, three days ago they did the Bohemian Grove?
[06:56:54.174 --> 06:56:56.575]  Can you guys pull that up on InfoWars.com?
[06:56:56.595 --> 06:56:57.335]  We'll try to tell you.
[06:56:57.695 --> 06:57:00.335]  Yeah, that's on InfoWars.com right now.
[06:57:00.495 --> 06:57:03.996]  Leaked pictures of Colin Powell at Bohemian Grove.
[06:57:04.036 --> 06:57:08.297]  And for our viewers who may not know what that is, that's a group who gets together
[06:57:08.997 --> 06:57:10.619]  And they worship a giant owl.
[06:57:10.659 --> 06:57:11.539]  I'm not making this up.
[06:57:11.579 --> 06:57:15.102]  They have mock sacrifices and dress up like women and have a good time.
[06:57:15.122 --> 06:57:15.763]  40-foot owl.
[06:57:15.783 --> 06:57:19.086]  They call him Moloch and they do an imitation child sacrifice.
[06:57:19.306 --> 06:57:24.030]  So if you would go to Infowars.com, hacked photos, show Colin Powell at Bohemian Grove.
[06:57:24.050 --> 06:57:24.950]  Do we have a date on that?
[06:57:25.711 --> 06:57:27.092]  I believe the article came out today.
[06:57:27.112 --> 06:57:28.633]  We'll see if there's a date in that.
[06:57:29.334 --> 06:57:30.395]  So what'd you want to say about that caller?
[06:57:31.308 --> 06:57:48.349]  It's been released on April 13th, but I always noted that they've warned us that immediately following a Bilderberg group or a Bohemian Grove group, they say look for within two weeks of those meetings, rapid change, usually oil prices or invasions or conflicts, sometimes terrorist events or the May Day.
[06:57:48.969 --> 06:57:50.491]  I was waiting until May 1st.
[06:57:51.793 --> 06:57:55.316]  Or this year's Osama Bin Laden story or something like that.
[06:57:56.057 --> 06:57:58.258]  And it just happened so quickly after it.
[06:57:58.318 --> 06:58:01.261]  And it's funny, I mentioned Bohemian Grove to family and they go, what?
[06:58:01.921 --> 06:58:08.466]  And I'm glad the Colin Powell pictures are up because it's now harder to deny that the Bohemian Grove meetings go down at all.
[06:58:08.486 --> 06:58:10.368]  And I hope people ask questions about
[06:58:10.868 --> 06:58:22.522]  And it's funny that Malcolm McDowell from A Clockwork Orange and the Leeko technique and mind programming and behavior modification is with those pictures with Colin Powell.
[06:58:23.177 --> 06:58:32.848]  Just a note, and also no one quite has linked back Boston to the origin airport of Logan Airport from the 9-11 terrorist attacks yet.
[06:58:33.469 --> 06:58:43.620]  And so if I was looking at another country and noticed that not a major city like LA, New York, Chicago, etc., but Boston, which is also
[06:58:44.301 --> 06:58:48.605]  I'm following it very very closely looking to see the funniest and also the worst
[06:59:05.879 --> 06:59:10.540]  I mean, everyone, of course, our thoughts and prayers go out to the victims of Boston.
[06:59:10.600 --> 06:59:10.940]  Of course.
[06:59:11.781 --> 06:59:20.783]  But it is, you know, it's just tragic to think that we are losing the right to speak freely, the right to assemble.
[06:59:20.803 --> 06:59:27.325]  They're not going to take the right, they're going to make us so fearful of assembling publicly that we'll basically tacitly lose that
[06:59:28.105 --> 06:59:33.206]  I hate to cut you off, but we've got to move on to some other callers.
[06:59:33.266 --> 06:59:34.406]  I definitely appreciate your call.
[06:59:34.706 --> 06:59:36.287]  We have an update.
[06:59:36.587 --> 06:59:40.428]  CNN is saying two dead and at least 110 people injured.
[06:59:40.668 --> 06:59:42.548]  That injury list is growing quite a bit.
[06:59:42.568 --> 06:59:43.148]  Yeah, it is.
[06:59:43.308 --> 06:59:45.349]  It's getting up there.
[06:59:45.369 --> 06:59:55.671]  And if you're saying, hey, I'm not seeing any of these articles you guys are talking about, you can go to InfoWars.com forward slash listen and you can see everything that's going on the show right now.
[06:59:55.711 --> 06:59:57.331]  And I do believe we're ready for our next caller.
[06:59:59.966 --> 07:00:00.767]  Mike in Canada.
[07:00:00.787 --> 07:00:01.567]  Are you there?
[07:00:02.488 --> 07:00:03.048]  Yes, I am.
[07:00:03.109 --> 07:00:03.709]  Good day, gentlemen.
[07:00:03.729 --> 07:00:04.410]  Good day.
[07:00:04.870 --> 07:00:05.390]  Hi, what's up?
[07:00:06.451 --> 07:00:10.034]  Well, I'm just looking at the markets today and seeing what's going on.
[07:00:10.554 --> 07:00:12.756]  Silver's off about 10 percent.
[07:00:12.796 --> 07:00:13.417]  Gold's down.
[07:00:14.517 --> 07:00:18.300]  The market seems to be getting pretty pretty hammered.
[07:00:18.340 --> 07:00:19.962]  Lots of sell-off before this happened today.
[07:00:19.982 --> 07:00:22.344]  And I'm just wondering previously to what the
[07:00:23.453 --> 07:00:30.059]  The previous caller alluded to about possibly what the end game of this could be if it was an inside job.
[07:00:30.760 --> 07:00:31.801]  Yeah, I find it interesting.
[07:00:31.841 --> 07:00:37.546]  It could be something connected with the economy, that maybe they plan on having a national day of mourning, closing down banks, that sort of thing.
[07:00:37.606 --> 07:00:37.906]  Bank holiday.
[07:00:37.926 --> 07:00:38.867]  It could be connected.
[07:00:39.833 --> 07:00:44.656]  I think it's very interesting that we just saw the crash of Bitcoin last week.
[07:00:44.956 --> 07:00:45.156]  Right.
[07:00:45.296 --> 07:00:58.464]  And that was, I mean, here we are, we've got a digital currency that is coming up in competition to all these fiat currencies being put out by these central banks and getting a lot of press and all of a sudden it crashes.
[07:00:58.524 --> 07:01:04.167]  And we know that the Federal Reserve has a quote-unquote plunge protection team that's supposed to stabilize the stock market.
[07:01:05.187 --> 07:01:07.948]  Basically, what they do is they manipulate the stock market.
[07:01:08.308 --> 07:01:17.750]  We know we've seen massive movements of gold in the past by the central banks to basically affect the gold market.
[07:01:18.090 --> 07:01:30.593]  And so today, I find it very interesting that just last week we had the competitor to these central bank fiat currencies get crashed and then gold, another competitor to their currencies, has an attack on it.
[07:01:31.673 --> 07:01:37.016]  Maybe not an attack, but it's just, it's dropping precipitously and as the caller pointed out, silver as well.
[07:01:37.236 --> 07:01:38.257]  And then this thing happens.
[07:01:38.297 --> 07:01:46.501]  Well, it's always, it's always a smokescreen because what is it, right before 9-11, we just, money just disappears into a black hole and then you have those attacks.
[07:01:47.182 --> 07:01:49.343]  And I mean, I definitely don't disagree with the caller.
[07:01:49.583 --> 07:01:52.525]  I think he definitely has some validity to his argument.
[07:01:53.005 --> 07:01:55.306]  I just, I don't have any specific answer.
[07:01:55.326 --> 07:01:55.867]  That's right.
[07:01:55.967 --> 07:01:56.147]  Yeah.
[07:01:57.288 --> 07:01:58.048]  Yeah.
[07:01:58.748 --> 07:01:59.669]  Anything else you want to add, caller?
[07:02:00.973 --> 07:02:03.494]  Well, I think right now, just basically watch the market and see what happens.
[07:02:03.514 --> 07:02:22.563]  It just seems that if this is an actual act of terror, that if it is a Saudi national, then, you know, the other the other side of the coin, if it's not a false flag, then maybe this could be a precipitous to precipitation or some sort of validity to go into Iran.
[07:02:22.944 --> 07:02:23.604]  This could be it.
[07:02:25.245 --> 07:02:25.885]  Yeah, that's true.
[07:02:26.065 --> 07:02:26.245]  Yeah.
[07:02:26.485 --> 07:02:27.966]  And let me ask you right before you go.
[07:02:28.206 --> 07:02:29.947]  We're still talking to Mike.
[07:02:31.502 --> 07:02:34.144]  Okay, now Mike, let me ask you just your personal opinion.
[07:02:34.164 --> 07:02:38.647]  Would it make you feel better or worse if this was a legitimate act of terror by a Saudi national?
[07:02:38.747 --> 07:02:39.488]  Just your opinion.
[07:02:40.768 --> 07:02:42.109]  To me, it really doesn't matter.
[07:02:42.209 --> 07:02:49.454]  The act is an act of terror, whether it's from the government or from an individual or a group of individuals.
[07:02:49.494 --> 07:02:50.575]  That really doesn't change.
[07:02:51.156 --> 07:02:56.579]  But it's just, it doesn't change my opinion what happened either way.
[07:02:57.440 --> 07:02:57.960]  It's an act.
[07:02:59.784 --> 07:03:01.545]  The idea behind it, who knows?
[07:03:01.625 --> 07:03:05.366]  We'll know more in the coming days, weeks, months, years, I guess.
[07:03:05.806 --> 07:03:07.807]  And it's also what the government does with it.
[07:03:08.107 --> 07:03:22.753]  They're going to use this, they're already using it, to create a narrative to take away our rights, to make this country less free, to destroy rights that are basically enshrined in the Constitution, just as they've done with the TSA and Homeland Security and the Patriot Act.
[07:03:23.393 --> 07:03:24.854]  They're going to continue and extend that.
[07:03:24.874 --> 07:03:26.955]  They're going to use that to come after the Second Amendment.
[07:03:27.715 --> 07:03:32.378]  Uh, and that's, and that's the key thing is how they use this, regardless of where it came from.
[07:03:32.718 --> 07:03:33.278]  How they use it.
[07:03:33.318 --> 07:03:34.619]  Yeah, and we'll move on to our next caller.
[07:03:34.639 --> 07:03:35.859]  Definitely appreciate you calling, Mike.
[07:03:36.360 --> 07:03:37.720]  We have Scott in Chicago.
[07:03:37.740 --> 07:03:40.722]  Hello, Jakari.
[07:03:40.742 --> 07:03:41.282]  Hello, Darren.
[07:03:41.882 --> 07:03:42.323]  How you doing?
[07:03:43.063 --> 07:03:43.703]  I'm doing real good.
[07:03:43.723 --> 07:03:45.824]  They kind of stole some of my thunder there.
[07:03:47.719 --> 07:04:01.711]  Connections there between the Bitcoin crash gold going down 250 and Just how crazy it seems a build-up of bad things happening than the bombings this morning And then also on the sci-fi.
[07:04:01.731 --> 07:04:13.822]  I'm not trying to promote it I'm just saying it's wacky to me that there's got to be some connection for the connection tonight on the sci-fi channel premieres the the program called defiance and
[07:04:14.617 --> 07:04:17.381]  Yeah, that takes place in, you know, some post...
[07:04:19.838 --> 07:04:45.231]  Apocalyptic type programming that's going to be appearing and I'm just, you know, more fear mongering, more get the people all afraid and how this may even lead into somehow, we'll see down the road, how this is going to tie into how we have to have more drones, more drones, not just TSA out on the street, but how if we could have had drones in the area, this could have been avoided.
[07:04:45.331 --> 07:04:47.872]  And I'm not pro-drone, I'm just saying.
[07:04:48.193 --> 07:04:56.375]  I'm just saying I'm anti-drone but how this could be used for how we you know an excuse to deploy drones throughout the city to
[07:04:57.358 --> 07:04:57.998]  Oh absolutely.
[07:04:58.499 --> 07:05:14.667]  And you're exactly right because they have these new drones with the sensors that can predict, that can see if you have a gun, and they're going to say, well if we had more surveillance, if we could see more of what everybody was doing every second during the marathon or whatever the case may be, the Super Bowl, what have you, then these things wouldn't happen.
[07:05:14.907 --> 07:05:20.130]  And they'll keep pushing that promise of yes, we'll keep you safe if you just let us surveil you more, but they can't keep you safe.
[07:05:20.290 --> 07:05:20.490]  Yeah.
[07:05:21.230 --> 07:05:21.671]  Big brother.
[07:05:22.791 --> 07:05:23.932]  Kudos to Alex.
[07:05:24.112 --> 07:05:26.334]  He really picked you guys, or some of the two.
[07:05:27.214 --> 07:05:28.795]  You guys are my favorite All-Stars.
[07:05:28.855 --> 07:05:43.785]  Now, in addition to Alex, not taking away anything from him, but you guys have been on this, and I just really enjoy being able to draw from the information that you have, and just as a word of encouragement to everybody that is listening.
[07:05:44.346 --> 07:05:46.467]  And not that I'm an advocate of this.
[07:05:46.547 --> 07:05:47.208]  I mean, even if
[07:05:48.084 --> 07:05:58.874]  Something terrible happened, and all the wicked people, all the evil people that are in our government and related, if something terrible happened to them, that still would not solve this problem.
[07:05:58.954 --> 07:06:00.235]  We are at a plate.
[07:06:00.416 --> 07:06:07.542]  We are in our country because of a spiritual situation, and our government is not the last authority here.
[07:06:07.922 --> 07:06:12.627]  It is the group of believers, the body of Christ, and we are warring daily.
[07:06:13.266 --> 07:06:16.769]  With, against Satan and against his forces.
[07:06:16.829 --> 07:06:19.531]  And that's where this battle is going to be won.
[07:06:19.551 --> 07:06:22.092]  This is a battle in the demonic realm.
[07:06:22.653 --> 07:06:36.723]  This is an issue of wickedness and evil spirits that are driving people in politics to do just insane things and employ insane, absolutely insane policies.
[07:06:38.760 --> 07:06:42.543]  And just steal our liberty and our freedom from us.
[07:06:42.923 --> 07:06:47.306]  And we in the body of Christ have to stand up and address this issue.
[07:06:47.366 --> 07:06:48.967]  And that's all I'd like to say, gentlemen.
[07:06:48.987 --> 07:06:49.367]  Thank you very much.
[07:06:49.387 --> 07:06:49.647]  Appreciate it.
[07:06:49.667 --> 07:06:50.308]  Thank you very much.
[07:06:50.708 --> 07:06:55.251]  You know, what he's talking about goes back to our first caller, really, and that is the Bohemian Grove thing.
[07:06:55.311 --> 07:07:01.455]  I think we all owe Alex a great debt of gratitude for breaking in there and getting that video of showing what they're doing there.
[07:07:02.055 --> 07:07:07.998]  I mean, you know, here you've got this scene that looks like, and anybody who hasn't seen this really needs to go online and take a look at this.
[07:07:08.018 --> 07:07:09.339]  Can we find that video?
[07:07:09.419 --> 07:07:10.579]  It's in the article.
[07:07:10.599 --> 07:07:16.042]  It's like something out of some, you know, cheap Steven Spielberg movie called Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, right?
[07:07:16.122 --> 07:07:22.065]  I mean, this is the kind of stuff that, you know, you couldn't make up anything weirder and more strange than this.
[07:07:22.105 --> 07:07:27.428]  Here you've got people like George Shultz and Colin Powell and, you know,
[07:07:27.788 --> 07:07:31.269]  Richard Nixon or whatever, these guys are... The most famous quote of it.
[07:07:31.669 --> 07:07:35.170]  And actually, Ronald Reagan, there's a picture of Ronald Reagan there at Bohemian Grove.
[07:07:35.190 --> 07:07:51.633]  And these guys are dressing up, I mean it's kind of a homosexual orgy, and then to top it off they dress up in robes and they have this mock cremation of care ceremony where they cremate a small child-like thing on this giant altar of an owl that they call Moloch.
[07:07:51.733 --> 07:07:54.153]  And anybody that knows the Bible knows where that comes from.
[07:07:54.233 --> 07:07:56.374]  Moloch's in the Bible, and I definitely
[07:07:57.054 --> 07:07:58.655]  Child sacrifice on a fire.
[07:07:58.815 --> 07:08:05.419]  I mean, there are plenty of people who don't have any type of spirituality, that may have something that's not Christian or whatever, whatever your belief is.
[07:08:05.779 --> 07:08:13.984]  The caller says, you know, he believes that faith is the way, but regardless of what you feel, you can look at your screen right now if you're watching on Infowars.com forward slash listen.
[07:08:14.284 --> 07:08:15.125]  That's what they believe.
[07:08:15.745 --> 07:08:16.566]  That's what they believe.
[07:08:16.586 --> 07:08:18.588]  They go and worship a giant owl.
[07:08:18.708 --> 07:08:19.809]  We're not making this up.
[07:08:20.070 --> 07:08:22.912]  So regardless if you're faithful or spiritual or not, they are.
[07:08:22.932 --> 07:08:27.837]  They have what they worship, and that is death and demonic things.
[07:08:28.037 --> 07:08:28.417]  Exactly.
[07:08:28.477 --> 07:08:30.139]  And it's like the singularity, right?
[07:08:30.299 --> 07:08:31.280]  Kurzweil and these people.
[07:08:31.801 --> 07:08:35.864]  They actually believe that they're going to transfer their consciousness into robots.
[07:08:36.085 --> 07:08:36.845]  That they're going to
[07:08:37.606 --> 07:08:42.710]  They're going to transcend humans, and they don't need humans anymore, and they're going to go to the stars, and they're going to live forever, and all that kind of stuff.
[07:08:42.730 --> 07:08:45.292]  Well, you know, we think, you know, they're nuts.
[07:08:45.312 --> 07:08:46.052]  They're not going to get that.
[07:08:46.313 --> 07:08:49.014]  But they're definitely dangerous, mad scientists.
[07:08:49.055 --> 07:08:50.015]  Oh yeah, they'll do whatever they have to do.
[07:08:50.035 --> 07:08:55.639]  You know, telling what they're going to do to the rest of us in pursuit of their, you know, wild fantasies and everything.
[07:08:55.940 --> 07:09:02.685]  But going back to this story about Bohemian Grove that just broke, what broke about that was some guy who's a hacker named Guccifer.
[07:09:03.565 --> 07:09:08.549]  And what he did was he was able to go in and hack emails to and from Colin Powell.
[07:09:08.989 --> 07:09:15.193]  And what you have here is a guy by the name of Andrew Knight, who is very high up in the Fox News hierarchy.
[07:09:15.634 --> 07:09:30.264]  And he sends an email to Colin Powell telling him that Colin Powell needs to get a hold of Tony Blair, former Prime Minister of the UK, and tell Tony that he needs to be at Bohemian Grove for that key thing there because he needs to get his priorities in order.
[07:09:30.504 --> 07:09:32.125]  Hi guys, how are you doing?
[07:09:32.145 --> 07:09:33.986]  You're doing a great job with this overdrive.
[07:09:52.668 --> 07:09:57.509]  Look, I don't know what you guys thought, but when I first heard this, what runs through my mind was false flag immediately.
[07:09:57.529 --> 07:09:59.689]  And I think, what agenda are they pushing?
[07:10:00.130 --> 07:10:00.890]  What are they going to do?
[07:10:00.910 --> 07:10:02.690]  TSA scanners on the street, etc.?
[07:10:03.010 --> 07:10:07.411]  I have no idea what their plan was, but I start worrying about how many more rights they're going to take.
[07:10:07.871 --> 07:10:13.132]  I'm from the Sandy Hook possible false flag state, where they just jammed the gun laws down our throat.
[07:10:13.592 --> 07:10:14.973]  So, you know, what do you guys think?
[07:10:14.993 --> 07:10:16.973]  When you first heard this, what went through your minds?
[07:10:17.506 --> 07:10:25.548]  Well, the false flag is always a possibility, you know, because we get accused, like, you know, if a cow gets hit in the middle of the road, like, oh, they say it was a conspiracy.
[07:10:25.608 --> 07:10:28.329]  I'm like, I just want to make sure what it is.
[07:10:28.369 --> 07:10:33.290]  And if you look at something like this, you have a bombing, you know, very suspected.
[07:10:33.310 --> 07:10:34.590]  Then more information comes out.
[07:10:34.951 --> 07:10:39.232]  Like Mike Adams reported a little bit earlier, there were reports that there was a drill
[07:10:40.892 --> 07:10:43.294]  Uh, the timing of it, it's on Patriots Day.
[07:10:43.394 --> 07:10:46.155]  If they want to blame a Patriot group, it's very ripe for that.
[07:10:46.496 --> 07:10:51.378]  So, I mean, as far as I'm concerned, I don't have any definitive answers, but to me, it definitely is suspect.
[07:10:51.458 --> 07:10:53.700]  Well, they've been preparing for this for a long time.
[07:10:53.740 --> 07:11:01.745]  They've been wanting to move the TSA into the streets, and as we talked about earlier, they've been putting the TSA and VIPER programs out on the streets, in bus stations, in railroad stations.
[07:11:01.765 --> 07:11:02.025]  Super Bowl.
[07:11:02.265 --> 07:11:03.025]  Yeah, Super Bowl.
[07:11:03.325 --> 07:11:04.686]  So, they've been trying to expand.
[07:11:04.706 --> 07:11:07.848]  You know, every bureaucracy is always trying to expand.
[07:11:08.088 --> 07:11:09.189]  It's empire building.
[07:11:09.369 --> 07:11:09.569]  Right?
[07:11:09.730 --> 07:11:18.661]  You talk to anybody from government, the first thing they tell you, I remember I had a friend who was in government and I had a business and the first thing he asked me was not about what our gross revenues were.
[07:11:18.961 --> 07:11:20.563]  That's what we would think about the private sector.
[07:11:20.883 --> 07:11:22.726]  His thing was how many people do you have reporting to you?
[07:11:23.584 --> 07:11:37.131]  I mean, that's the way they think, because they don't generate, I mean, the revenue is just what they steal from people, but, you know, the bottom line is how many people you have reporting to you, that's how they grow, that's how their prestige, their salary grows, is by expanding that empire.
[07:11:37.391 --> 07:11:41.133]  So they're always looking for new ways to expand it, and they're always looking for an excuse.
[07:11:41.534 --> 07:11:45.876]  Now, whether they started this or not, they're going to use it as an excuse to expand in those areas.
[07:11:46.076 --> 07:11:47.177]  They're already talking about it.
[07:11:47.197 --> 07:11:49.518]  That's right, guys.
[07:11:50.609 --> 07:11:51.370]  Well, thanks for calling in.
[07:11:51.390 --> 07:11:51.930]  I appreciate it.
[07:11:51.950 --> 07:11:53.111]  Who's next, Dakar?
[07:11:53.131 --> 07:11:55.513]  OK, we have David in Canada again.
[07:11:55.533 --> 07:11:56.233]  Am I reading that right?
[07:11:58.575 --> 07:11:59.255]  Thunder Bay, Canada.
[07:11:59.355 --> 07:11:59.535]  OK.
[07:12:00.116 --> 07:12:01.837]  Is this a different David or the same David?
[07:12:02.698 --> 07:12:03.158]  Different David.
[07:12:03.378 --> 07:12:04.079]  OK, go ahead.
[07:12:05.640 --> 07:12:06.060]  No, I do.
[07:12:06.220 --> 07:12:09.422]  I know there's more than one in Canada.
[07:12:09.522 --> 07:12:10.103]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[07:12:10.123 --> 07:12:11.324]  There's more than one David in Canada.
[07:12:13.610 --> 07:12:32.132]  No, I was just wanting to, like, one thing I've noticed that not a lot of people are paying attention to is, if you guys have been seeing what Fox News has been saying, like, one of the accommodators was saying that, you know, there should be death to all Muslims because of this, you know, if this happens to be a Muslim act, and, you know, it's just kind of very surprising, like, how everybody's jumping on that bandwagon right away.
[07:12:32.916 --> 07:12:39.360]  I haven't seen that particular clip, but the fear-mongering and the hate-mongering is nothing new to the mainstream networks.
[07:12:39.920 --> 07:12:42.041]  I believe, not even just networks, but was it?
[07:12:42.601 --> 07:12:47.064]  The LA Times said if you're a white southern gun owner, you're a terrorist and you're worse than Al-Qaeda.
[07:12:47.424 --> 07:12:48.865]  But I'm sorry not to cut you off, go ahead.
[07:12:49.945 --> 07:13:01.612]  Yeah, so I'm just, I wouldn't be surprised if this is something, you know, like an Iranian official or Iranian person or something that could give them reason to go to Iran or go to any of the other countries that are there right now because
[07:13:02.256 --> 07:13:07.561]  It's just, it's too much out there, and I'm surprised I have so many friends saying, oh, but look how terrible it's happening.
[07:13:07.581 --> 07:13:09.623]  I go, well, look, they're doing bomb training today.
[07:13:09.643 --> 07:13:15.790]  They have bomb-sifting dogs that are supposedly only a few feet away from the bomb incident.
[07:13:16.250 --> 07:13:20.714]  And, you know, they were, they had these state-of-the-art life support systems already in play.
[07:13:20.955 --> 07:13:23.677]  It's just, it's got, it's got written all over it, FBI, CIA.
[07:13:25.876 --> 07:13:31.980]  You know, and when they were just saying on CNN about 15 minutes after the bomb and they said, oh, our top bomb experts are already on site.
[07:13:32.580 --> 07:13:34.061]  Well, you know, and that's another thing, too.
[07:13:34.101 --> 07:13:39.665]  If it wasn't a false flag drill and they were there looking for bombs and everything, what does it say about their competence?
[07:13:39.945 --> 07:13:42.306]  These are the people that are going to protect us from everything.
[07:13:42.326 --> 07:13:43.587]  So we shouldn't be armed or anything.
[07:13:43.967 --> 07:13:49.991]  Are they not competent enough that when they've got a bomb sniffing dogs and crew and everything going over this, they can't find something like that?
[07:13:50.171 --> 07:13:57.714]  Yeah, and just talking about the TSA, I'm not going to say his name, but we had a guest in studio the other day who was telling us about his experience with the TSA.
[07:13:57.754 --> 07:14:03.457]  He said he goes to a TSA scanner, drops a joint, a marijuana joint on the ground.
[07:14:03.477 --> 07:14:04.057]  I was like, oops.
[07:14:04.377 --> 07:14:06.438]  And the TSA guy didn't even care.
[07:14:06.839 --> 07:14:09.940]  You know, and I mean, it's just the kind of thing you have to do, just like David pointed out.
[07:14:12.910 --> 07:14:16.712]  If it was true, with lone gunmen or whatever, what does it say about their confidence?
[07:14:16.732 --> 07:14:18.293]  Just to reiterate what you said.
[07:14:18.433 --> 07:14:23.577]  Yeah, and as we know, the TSA has been proven by their own internal testing to be totally incompetent.
[07:14:23.957 --> 07:14:26.839]  And so the very fact that we haven't had a bombing says that there's not a threat there.
[07:14:28.439 --> 07:14:32.042]  Okay, I believe we have a caller, I mean, we have a video coming up.
[07:14:32.202 --> 07:14:32.902]  Thanks for your call.
[07:14:32.942 --> 07:14:34.623]  David, if you guys are ready with the video.
[07:14:37.485 --> 07:14:38.005]  Is he still on?
[07:14:38.946 --> 07:14:39.186]  David?
[07:14:41.607 --> 07:14:42.507]  Okay, I think he's gone.
[07:14:42.687 --> 07:14:43.108]  We're all set.
[07:14:43.128 --> 07:14:45.128]  All right, we can go to a new video here.
[07:14:46.409 --> 07:14:50.911]  But you know, it's just... And Peter, what are you waiting to hear about in these coming hours?
[07:14:51.631 --> 07:14:59.674]  I think the actual constituency inside the bomb is going to make a big difference about how we identify the person who did this or the persons who did this.
[07:14:59.854 --> 07:15:02.436]  Because if it's hydrogen peroxide, that points to al-Qaeda.
[07:15:02.476 --> 07:15:06.637]  If it's something else, it could be a different, it could be a right-wing extremist group or some other group.
[07:15:06.897 --> 07:15:08.218]  I now turn it over to Wolf Blitzer.
[07:15:11.374 --> 07:15:27.984]  Alright folks, I went on the radio today, hours before this happened, it's on record, the 15th of April, and I said I can see all the scripting with the TV shows, the movies, where it's the right wing patriots that are going to stage the terror, they're going to merge with Al Qaeda, Founding Fathers, The Following, all these shows.
[07:15:28.485 --> 07:15:30.626]  And I said I see them staging it very soon.
[07:15:31.667 --> 07:15:34.088]  Because I see a crescendo of the preparation going.
[07:15:34.368 --> 07:15:36.109]  When you know what's going on, this stuff's all scripted.
[07:15:37.070 --> 07:15:40.292]  And just about 30 minutes ago, it's like
[07:15:41.028 --> 07:15:43.510]  425, show people the atomic clock.
[07:15:43.790 --> 07:15:44.250]  425 Central.
[07:15:47.093 --> 07:15:52.176]  So at about 4, they come out and say that it could be right-wing groups.
[07:15:52.236 --> 07:16:03.404]  Now look, here is this establishment authoritarian site that poses as liberal, Alex Jones declares Boston a false flag operation, FBI behind every domestic terror plot.
[07:16:03.645 --> 07:16:05.346]  I'll put a link to the New York Times with that headline.
[07:16:06.058 --> 07:16:06.678]  from a year ago.
[07:16:07.139 --> 07:16:10.621]  Why don't you tell them in your article that it was a link to the New York Times.
[07:16:11.061 --> 07:16:12.342]  You know you're not going to do that.
[07:16:12.362 --> 07:16:15.904]  Even before them, Salon, Boston Explosion, a government conspiracy.
[07:16:17.044 --> 07:16:20.166]  We see a false flag of the violent Tea Party to expand the TSA.
[07:16:20.206 --> 07:16:21.067]  I said a lot more than that.
[07:16:22.247 --> 07:16:24.929]  They're telling the police there will be bombings everywhere by right wingers.
[07:16:25.349 --> 07:16:26.990]  They're saying get ready to arrest Christians.
[07:16:27.010 --> 07:16:28.091]  This is mainstream news.
[07:16:28.691 --> 07:16:29.992]  Now they're saying it could be Saudis.
[07:16:31.078 --> 07:16:38.721]  My point is, is that it's Patriots Day in Boston, and while Oath Keepers is there, I would be crazy to not be concerned.
[07:16:38.761 --> 07:16:39.521]  Now, look at this.
[07:16:40.641 --> 07:16:43.662]  UM coach, bomb-stiffing dogs were at start-finish lines.
[07:16:44.063 --> 07:16:47.904]  They had loudspeakers saying, it's just a drill, everything's fine, and then boom, it happens.
[07:16:48.669 --> 07:16:50.270]  That's done over and over again.
[07:16:50.290 --> 07:16:53.313]  7-7, the Madrid bombing, Gladia, they always have drills.
[07:16:53.693 --> 07:17:01.320]  So in case the compartmentalized group of mercenaries doing it with police uniforms or FBI, it varies, get caught, oh, it was part of the drill.
[07:17:01.940 --> 07:17:07.205]  Like when Putin's people got caught back in 99 planting bombs in a fourth building, they were going to blow up to blame on the opposition.
[07:17:07.805 --> 07:17:08.986]  They said, oh, it's part of a drill.
[07:17:09.707 --> 07:17:11.308]  And that's how they got on the local police station.
[07:17:11.328 --> 07:17:12.008]  Look all this up.
[07:17:12.548 --> 07:17:13.188]  It's a drill.
[07:17:13.308 --> 07:17:15.449]  Oh, we were just practicing robbing the bank.
[07:17:15.809 --> 07:17:16.810]  You know, if you get caught.
[07:17:17.350 --> 07:17:18.750]  So, that's what's going on.
[07:17:18.790 --> 07:17:19.911]  This article is key.
[07:17:20.071 --> 07:17:23.212]  UM Coach, Bomb Civic Dogs, we're at start and finish lines.
[07:17:23.552 --> 07:17:24.292]  And this is key.
[07:17:24.452 --> 07:17:29.134]  It proves that the drill was happening even before Deering and then after the marathon.
[07:17:30.077 --> 07:17:31.178]  Do you understand what that means?
[07:17:31.919 --> 07:17:33.481]  Do you understand what that means?
[07:17:33.541 --> 07:17:40.688]  Now, if you go to InfoWars.com forward slash listen or follow us at Twitter at RealAlexJones, we're doing live video coverage.
[07:17:40.949 --> 07:17:42.130]  I'll be live tonight at 7.
[07:17:43.872 --> 07:17:48.537]  You can also see our live feed right now with our reporters Jakari Jackson.
[07:17:50.197 --> 07:18:03.841]  Everybody, Rob Dew, David Knight, everybody, Adon Salazar, Kurt Nemo, they are all in here absolutely kicking butt on this in a warm room situation.
[07:18:03.901 --> 07:18:07.462]  But we have confirmed that there have been drills throughout the day continually.
[07:18:07.502 --> 07:18:08.543]  Now check this out right here.
[07:18:10.503 --> 07:18:12.064]  We've got our incredible team in here working.
[07:18:12.144 --> 07:18:14.064]  John Bowne behind the wheel.
[07:18:14.244 --> 07:18:15.105]  Look, you can look right in there.
[07:18:15.125 --> 07:18:15.765]  We've got our crew.
[07:18:16.992 --> 07:18:18.833]  Going right now, I'm about to go on there with Mike Adams.
[07:18:19.113 --> 07:18:24.614]  So, again, InfoWars.com forward slash listen to find the free video feed and audio feeds.
[07:18:25.054 --> 07:18:26.715]  Get this on your Twitter, Facebook, you name it.
[07:18:27.575 --> 07:18:36.558]  If we can put attention on the fact that they're running a drill, if it was a false flag, which the Globalists have done it over and over again, they've been caught over and over again, Gladio, you name it.
[07:18:37.598 --> 07:18:43.003]  Cars, I said a few months ago, the West is staging bombings as an excuse to be here and to destabilize the government.
[07:18:43.103 --> 07:18:47.287]  In Afghanistan, British MI6 has been caught staging bombings, even London Guardian.
[07:18:47.648 --> 07:18:48.969]  In Iraq, to keep the war going.
[07:18:49.009 --> 07:18:49.409]  Remember that?
[07:18:50.290 --> 07:18:52.832]  We'd be crazy to not look at them as the main suspects.
[07:18:52.852 --> 07:18:54.014]  They have the motor to get more power.
[07:18:54.614 --> 07:18:56.817]  This could be, you know, real organic terrorists.
[07:18:57.197 --> 07:18:58.980]  They're rare, but they're not like unicorns.
[07:18:59.000 --> 07:18:59.640]  They do exist.
[07:19:00.141 --> 07:19:02.564]  Okay, but almost like unicorns.
[07:19:02.584 --> 07:19:03.846]  It could be mentally ill patsies.
[07:19:04.026 --> 07:19:06.349]  We don't know, but they have a history of it.
[07:19:06.409 --> 07:19:08.552]  So Salon and the rest of you, I was right again.
[07:19:08.812 --> 07:19:10.995]  They are trying to imply it could be us, okay?
[07:19:12.452 --> 07:19:14.254]  Who stands to gain from all this, ladies and gentlemen?
[07:19:14.274 --> 07:19:15.055]  But I'll be in there.
[07:19:15.135 --> 07:19:15.955]  Continued coverage.
[07:19:16.356 --> 07:19:18.958]  And you'll be able to see PrisonPlanet.tv nightly news tonight.
[07:19:19.198 --> 07:19:22.521]  InfoWars.com forward slash listen or follow us at Twitter, RealAlexJones.
[07:19:22.541 --> 07:19:26.405]  We're going to keep tweeting out the live free link to watch the show.
[07:19:26.705 --> 07:19:28.287]  Alex Jones signing off for InfoWars.
[07:19:28.907 --> 07:19:33.108]  .com and the Death Star is orbiting the planet and is clear to fire in five minutes.
[07:19:33.168 --> 07:19:38.369]  I mean, they need to do this to turn the billions of bullets, the armored vehicles, the checkpoints loose on us.
[07:19:38.589 --> 07:19:39.910]  They need to make us the terrorists.
[07:19:40.090 --> 07:19:41.310]  They've been saying we're the terrorists.
[07:19:41.330 --> 07:19:44.351]  They're already scripting that so we know what comes next in the play.
[07:19:44.651 --> 07:19:47.791]  We've got to counter them on this so that people know where to look.
[07:19:48.192 --> 07:19:54.293]  And anybody with intel in Boston, anything you saw personally, or people that track things on the news, keep emailing us all your tips.
[07:19:54.773 --> 07:19:55.894]  Because they do not want it out.
[07:19:55.914 --> 07:19:56.674]  They were running drills.
[07:19:56.694 --> 07:19:58.755]  That is big news and it's not in the national news.
[07:19:59.176 --> 07:20:02.497]  It's only here and on local news right here.
[07:20:03.018 --> 07:20:04.218]  Local 15 TV.
[07:20:04.539 --> 07:20:05.359]  Get that out to everybody.
[07:20:05.399 --> 07:20:07.180]  It's also up on Infowars.com mirrored.
[07:20:07.440 --> 07:20:08.301]  Alex Jones signing off.
[07:20:08.321 --> 07:20:09.802]  I'm going to get in there and get live with Mike Adams.
[07:20:13.919 --> 07:20:14.499]  Good job.
[07:20:14.860 --> 07:20:20.644]  If you're watching on Infowars.com forward slash listen, we'd like to hear from you, especially if you're in the Boston area.
[07:20:20.984 --> 07:20:21.944]  We'll give out the phone number.
[07:20:22.585 --> 07:20:25.867]  Now this is going to be the Sunday phone number, not the regular phone number.
[07:20:25.887 --> 07:20:26.387]  877-789-ALEX.
[07:20:26.407 --> 07:20:26.728]  That's 877-789-2539.
[07:20:26.768 --> 07:20:27.928]  And we'll go to our next caller.
[07:20:37.294 --> 07:20:38.515]  Okay, so we'll just wait.
[07:20:38.935 --> 07:20:44.097]  If you're watching this, you just saw a real interesting behind-the-scenes tour there with Alex showing you what's going on.
[07:20:44.137 --> 07:20:49.400]  But again, if we got anybody there that's in Boston that has any first-hand knowledge of this, we want to hear that.
[07:20:49.440 --> 07:20:53.902]  If you've got any tips for us, please email us at showtips at InfoWars.
[07:20:53.922 --> 07:20:55.542]  You can look at the contact information there.
[07:20:55.943 --> 07:20:57.743]  Let us know if you've got any information.
[07:20:58.404 --> 07:21:00.305]  All right, and Greg in Rhode Island.
[07:21:00.385 --> 07:21:03.306]  Okay, Greg in Rhode Island, you are on the air.
[07:21:05.751 --> 07:21:06.211]  Hello, Greg.
[07:21:07.553 --> 07:21:07.933]  Hi, guys.
[07:21:07.953 --> 07:21:09.034]  How you doing?
[07:21:10.435 --> 07:21:10.996]  I'm pretty good.
[07:21:11.016 --> 07:21:13.098]  All right, so what you call about today?
[07:21:14.299 --> 07:21:16.120]  Hey, Jakari, it's Guccifer.
[07:21:17.221 --> 07:21:17.722]  Guccifer.
[07:21:19.103 --> 07:21:19.403]  Okay.
[07:21:19.684 --> 07:21:25.068]  And the other guy's name, I'm not sure your name, but I think we will emulate the brain.
[07:21:25.329 --> 07:21:30.794]  I think we'll enter the matrix and you'll probably still be under my control and won't even know the difference.
[07:21:33.999 --> 07:21:37.002]  I am enjoying the coverage of this.
[07:21:37.062 --> 07:21:41.546]  Hey listen, we're not against people smoking marijuana, that's your right.
[07:21:42.066 --> 07:21:44.148]  But don't get stoned off your ass and call in here.
[07:21:44.168 --> 07:21:46.970]  This is like X-Wings flying the trench here.
[07:21:46.991 --> 07:21:50.634]  This is not a joke.
[07:21:51.354 --> 07:21:52.755]  Relax and watch the show.
[07:21:53.096 --> 07:21:56.118]  Yeah, we're not screaming calls here obviously, but we're going to get our next call.
[07:21:56.198 --> 07:21:56.939]  Absolutely.
[07:21:56.959 --> 07:21:57.780]  Thanks for calling.
[07:21:58.261 --> 07:22:00.366]  Okay, thanks for your call.
[07:22:00.407 --> 07:22:02.553]  I'm going to Brad in Ohio.
[07:22:02.573 --> 07:22:05.521]  Hey, how you guys doing?
[07:22:05.541 --> 07:22:06.082]  Doing very well.
[07:22:06.243 --> 07:22:06.463]  Go ahead.
[07:22:06.963 --> 07:22:13.190]  I've been listening to your show since about 4 p.m.
[07:22:13.270 --> 07:22:28.446]  and I was watching Fox News at the same time and I heard they played a clip of Joe Biden saying something to the effect that he turned on the TV and he saw that there were two bombings that happened in Boston and this is prior to
[07:22:29.186 --> 07:22:33.348]  Yeah, I'm not sure if we have that clip ready to go, but I did see the clip that you're alluding to and that's
[07:22:46.173 --> 07:22:48.254]  I brought that up when we talked about Obama.
[07:22:48.314 --> 07:23:00.499]  Joe Biden made a very pointed statement with the information that he had at the time, but he had information of a bombing, and then Obama comes up and gives this very bland, vanilla statement with no real detail to it at all.
[07:23:00.519 --> 07:23:02.539]  So I definitely know what you're talking about there.
[07:23:02.599 --> 07:23:04.000]  Is this like the BBC in Building 7?
[07:23:04.140 --> 07:23:07.621]  It's going to come down 20 minutes before it does?
[07:23:07.721 --> 07:23:10.222]  Yeah, so I definitely think it's a suspicious caller.
[07:23:10.823 --> 07:23:11.563]  What are your thoughts on it?
[07:23:12.544 --> 07:23:18.407]  Well, I mean, anybody that would, you know, turn on the TV and see that wouldn't immediately think bombing, you know.
[07:23:18.547 --> 07:23:19.268]  Who knows what happened?
[07:23:19.288 --> 07:23:20.949]  Maybe it was a gas bomb, like they were saying at first.
[07:23:20.989 --> 07:23:22.569]  I mean, you wouldn't know.
[07:23:22.649 --> 07:23:24.490]  You would just think, oh, there was an explosion.
[07:23:24.690 --> 07:23:30.073]  So anybody turning on the TV seeing this would say, oh, you know, there was an explosion in Boston.
[07:23:30.393 --> 07:23:32.475]  You know, that's what an old person will conclude.
[07:23:32.495 --> 07:23:38.898]  For him to just come on and say right away, I noticed that there was two bombings in Boston just really surprised me.
[07:23:40.179 --> 07:23:44.501]  Biden always has to put his foot in his mouth.
[07:23:44.721 --> 07:23:46.542]  We definitely appreciate your call, but we're going to jump quick.
[07:23:46.802 --> 07:23:48.844]  We'll go now to Jay in California.
[07:23:48.864 --> 07:23:51.445]  Hello?
[07:23:51.685 --> 07:23:52.165]  Hello, Jay.
[07:23:53.266 --> 07:23:54.127]  Yeah, how you doing?
[07:23:54.407 --> 07:23:54.987]  Doing very well.
[07:23:55.007 --> 07:23:55.487]  You're on the air.
[07:23:55.507 --> 07:23:55.848]  Go ahead.
[07:23:57.809 --> 07:24:05.313]  Last week, the CBS local reported online in Boston that the police had thrown a bunch of chemical bottle bombs.
[07:24:05.333 --> 07:24:06.754]  I don't know if you guys picked that up.
[07:24:07.074 --> 07:24:07.214]  No.
[07:24:07.274 --> 07:24:08.495]  Do you have the headline?
[07:24:10.088 --> 07:24:11.530]  Um, I think so.
[07:24:11.550 --> 07:24:12.631]  Hold on, let me check the webpage.
[07:24:12.691 --> 07:24:14.652]  I gotta turn down my radio so we can get feedback.
[07:24:17.595 --> 07:24:19.356]  So you're saying that there's a report?
[07:24:19.817 --> 07:24:28.865]  Yes, boston.cbslocal.com, 2013, slash 4, slash 5, slash 50 gas bottle bombs.
[07:24:30.546 --> 07:24:31.507]  What's the headline?
[07:24:31.567 --> 07:24:32.448]  What's the headline on that?
[07:24:32.468 --> 07:24:36.251]  You'll have to read us the, uh... Bottle bombs discovered on the streets of Lawrence.
[07:24:36.271 --> 07:24:37.292]  Can you say that one more time?
[07:24:38.728 --> 07:24:41.589]  50 bottle bombs discovered on the streets of Lawrence.
[07:24:41.810 --> 07:24:43.190]  Okay, if we can try to pull that up, guys.
[07:24:43.210 --> 07:24:45.471]  50 bottle bombs found on the streets of Lawrence.
[07:24:45.971 --> 07:24:46.832]  Okay, go ahead, Collin.
[07:24:47.052 --> 07:24:49.573]  But it seems like this is totally pre-planned.
[07:24:49.873 --> 07:24:52.254]  A few other things I found, too.
[07:24:53.675 --> 07:24:56.496]  Boston PD is having bomb drills all month.
[07:24:56.936 --> 07:24:58.197]  I have friends that live there.
[07:25:00.418 --> 07:25:03.119]  And now, do you know how close Lawrence is to Boston?
[07:25:04.051 --> 07:25:04.911]  It's part of Boston.
[07:25:05.011 --> 07:25:05.932]  Oh, it is part of Boston.
[07:25:05.952 --> 07:25:06.312]  Okay.
[07:25:06.952 --> 07:25:13.054]  And if you're watching on Infowars.com forward slash, listen, can we scroll up to, uh, up?
[07:25:13.594 --> 07:25:14.834]  Yeah, let's see the headline there.
[07:25:15.074 --> 07:25:18.616]  It's the authorities seeking those responsible for Lawrence bottle bombs.
[07:25:19.036 --> 07:25:20.556]  And who, who's the source on this?
[07:25:21.877 --> 07:25:23.177]  And that's the Boston Herald.
[07:25:23.577 --> 07:25:23.877]  Okay.
[07:25:23.897 --> 07:25:28.779]  So we're looking at a different article than you are, but we see the same article and appears to have a video there.
[07:25:28.799 --> 07:25:30.579]  We're not going to show it right now for the sake of time.
[07:25:31.039 --> 07:25:33.000]  But what did you find in your article, Collar?
[07:25:34.327 --> 07:25:41.670]  Um, it was just, they found exploded bottles and unexploded bottles and trash cans and like, randomly just dropped along the street.
[07:25:41.710 --> 07:25:46.051]  So it seemed like they were testing, like, the public site if this was a setup, you know?
[07:25:46.471 --> 07:25:52.293]  Like, prior to if it was an inside job, they would obviously want to do a test run to see what people did.
[07:25:52.813 --> 07:25:55.694]  And the chemical bomb didn't cause any damage at all.
[07:25:55.955 --> 07:25:56.335]  Right.
[07:25:56.495 --> 07:26:02.837]  So it seems really suspicious, you know, because people that would do something like that would want to cause damage.
[07:26:03.373 --> 07:26:04.614]  Yeah, exactly, exactly.
[07:26:04.994 --> 07:26:07.815]  Okay, we definitely appreciate your call, but we have many more, so we're going to jump.
[07:26:08.795 --> 07:26:10.436]  We'll look at Paul in Georgia.
[07:26:10.456 --> 07:26:13.037]  Paul, you there?
[07:26:14.178 --> 07:26:14.798]  Paul in Georgia.
[07:26:16.078 --> 07:26:16.599]  Yes, hello?
[07:26:17.019 --> 07:26:17.719]  Oh, yes, go ahead.
[07:26:18.219 --> 07:26:19.060]  Hey, good afternoon.
[07:26:20.000 --> 07:26:31.785]  Yeah, pretty much everyone kind of covered the stuff I wanted to talk about, except for I was watching online through the Fox, you know, their national media, but they were patched in through their local Fox affiliate.
[07:26:32.606 --> 07:26:44.536]  And it just reminded me of what happened in Oklahoma City where the anchor started talking about how they found two to three devices and they were dismantled.
[07:26:45.597 --> 07:26:46.998]  They don't know what happened with it.
[07:26:48.159 --> 07:26:55.946]  It just angers me because the expert that they had on to me was laying the groundwork and the footwork to
[07:26:56.838 --> 07:27:22.519]  Makes American people believe that it's domestic, and then he starts talking about today's Patriots Day, and that it's, you know, with all the gun laws that have been changed recently, there's a lot of extremist groups, and, you know, they want us to believe that right-wing conservatives are a bunch of beer-bellied, wife-beaten, Bible-thumping, toothless, kill-billies.
[07:27:23.342 --> 07:27:34.128]  But then we're also supposed to be sophisticated enough to plant bombs right at the finish line where there's nothing but cameras, nothing but media everywhere.
[07:27:34.168 --> 07:27:34.848]  That's a good point.
[07:27:35.108 --> 07:27:37.230]  And it just seems like a false flag to me.
[07:27:37.550 --> 07:27:38.130]  That's a good point.
[07:27:38.170 --> 07:27:47.755]  You know, that point you just made, the finish line has got to be the most difficult place to put anything like that and get away with it.
[07:27:47.815 --> 07:27:51.878]  I mean, these guys, whoever they did it, they were absolutely masterminds or else they
[07:27:52.598 --> 07:27:58.783]  Yeah, I mean, because even the fact that you take into account, you know, they have the bomb-sniffing dogs, let's say it is a legitimate act, which it very well could be.
[07:27:59.203 --> 07:28:03.147]  I mean, not a legitimate act of terror, but you know, not a false flag.
[07:28:03.587 --> 07:28:12.494]  If it's just, you know, the lone nutter, you know, the lone group, and they go and put their bombs there after the bomb-sniffing dogs, I mean, it'd be very hard not to capture these guys on camera.
[07:28:12.774 --> 07:28:15.917]  Even if they couldn't immediately apprehend them, we should have an image
[07:28:16.497 --> 07:28:16.677]  Yeah.
[07:28:16.877 --> 07:28:17.817]  Of who these people are.
[07:28:17.937 --> 07:28:18.558]  Yeah, you would think so.
[07:28:18.578 --> 07:28:21.478]  They've got cameras everywhere, especially in big cities like Boston.
[07:28:21.998 --> 07:28:37.823]  And what you were just saying about the narrative, trying to pin it on constitutionalists or whatever, that is the mainstream media narrative in spite of the fact that it's been reported that the only suspect they've got is a Saudi national they're still going after quote-unquote right-wing terrorists.
[07:28:38.063 --> 07:28:38.303]  Right.
[07:28:39.103 --> 07:28:41.484]  And we'll start moving through some of our calls.
[07:28:42.124 --> 07:28:43.084]  Sean in Texas.
[07:28:44.807 --> 07:28:45.507]  Oh yeah, hello?
[07:28:45.808 --> 07:28:46.408]  Yes, go ahead.
[07:28:47.108 --> 07:29:02.238]  Oh, I wanted to, uh, my friend Jordan earlier this morning pointed out to me that last November, uh, Boston had a scheduled Urban Shield training, and you can go to the website bostonurbanshield.org.
[07:29:02.258 --> 07:29:03.679]  Can you give that one more time?
[07:29:04.499 --> 07:29:07.682]  bostonurbanshield.org.
[07:29:07.762 --> 07:29:09.062]  Can we pull that up, guys?
[07:29:09.703 --> 07:29:09.943]  Go ahead.
[07:29:11.383 --> 07:29:22.214]  Anyway, it just shows on here that last, well, the May in, yeah, May 2011, 20 to the 22nd, they had Boston Urban Shield.
[07:29:22.694 --> 07:29:27.699]  And then I went further in and found that at the cityofboston.gov,
[07:29:29.162 --> 07:29:30.063]  There's a link to it.
[07:29:30.083 --> 07:29:43.294]  I emailed it to you guys probably several times and it shows that Mayor Menino announces Urban Shield Boston simulated 24-hour public safety exercise in the city of Boston last November.
[07:29:43.314 --> 07:29:45.656]  And we saw one from 2011.
[07:29:46.177 --> 07:29:48.278]  Is that the one you're referring to?
[07:29:49.820 --> 07:29:56.725]  That's the only website I could find that shows a kind of graphical representation of what it is.
[07:29:57.806 --> 07:30:15.460]  And if you go to cityofboston.gov forward slash news forward slash default dot ASPX question mark ID.
[07:30:16.120 --> 07:30:18.122]  Okay, can you just tell us what's on that site?
[07:30:19.643 --> 07:30:20.063]  Which site?
[07:30:20.444 --> 07:30:21.124]  The site you just gave.
[07:30:21.144 --> 07:30:23.446]  Can you just give us a quick synopsis of what's on the site?
[07:30:24.130 --> 07:30:29.752]  Well, this just shows that Mayor Menino announced that Urban Shield Boston simulated 24-hour public safety.
[07:30:30.232 --> 07:30:42.337]  So what you saw on the 2011 website, the graphical description, the City of Boston and a few other news sources in the City of Boston showed that they did it last November as well.
[07:30:42.577 --> 07:30:45.738]  And it's a huge, structured simulation event.
[07:30:46.218 --> 07:30:46.358]  Yeah.
[07:30:46.538 --> 07:30:46.658]  Okay.
[07:30:46.678 --> 07:30:48.439]  Alright, we definitely appreciate your call.
[07:30:49.079 --> 07:30:50.300]  I believe we have some breaking news.
[07:30:50.340 --> 07:30:51.580]  Yeah, we got something that just came in.
[07:30:51.600 --> 07:30:54.281]  This is off of the Squamishchief.com.
[07:30:54.961 --> 07:30:57.422]  And what he says here, this is published today.
[07:30:57.882 --> 07:31:04.905]  He says, runners getting set to take part in the Boston Marathon were warned beforehand that they were going to die, said a Squamish resident who took part in the race.
[07:31:05.625 --> 07:31:14.389]  Mike Heiliger, 59, said a woman holding several bags was telling runners who were picking up their pre-race packages in downtown Boston on Saturday, that'd be April 13th.
[07:31:15.290 --> 07:31:17.872]  That they were going to die if they participated in the event.
[07:31:18.532 --> 07:31:22.515]  I was downtown on Saturday, and you know, you see these people on the street and think it's just some nut bar.
[07:31:22.535 --> 07:31:26.037]  He told the chief from his Boston that the chief would be the newspaper.
[07:31:26.918 --> 07:31:28.518]  From his Boston hotel on Monday.
[07:31:28.938 --> 07:31:36.060]  He said it was a little creepy because you can identify who the runners are and I heard her say to this runner two feet away from me that if you run tomorrow you're going to die.
[07:31:36.860 --> 07:31:39.981]  He said he thought about telling the woman that the race was Monday but decided not to correct her.
[07:31:40.001 --> 07:31:44.561]  Heiliger was in the process of calling the police after his conversation with the paper.
[07:31:44.941 --> 07:31:52.863]  He said I thought it was just a nut and maybe she was a nut but she was holding a couple of bags like she got off a plane and was just accosting runners on Saturday.
[07:31:54.025 --> 07:31:55.186]  So that's kind of interesting.
[07:31:55.426 --> 07:31:57.227]  That is definitely interesting.
[07:31:57.367 --> 07:32:03.992]  I think Squamish is perhaps a suburb of Boston and maybe the Chief is the name of a paper.
[07:32:04.913 --> 07:32:06.214]  The Chief is the headline here.
[07:32:06.714 --> 07:32:11.498]  Alright, once again we're taking calls at 877-789-ALEX.
[07:32:11.538 --> 07:32:14.700]  We'll go on to our next caller who is Curtis in Wisconsin.
[07:32:17.951 --> 07:32:18.952]  Thanks for taking my phone call.
[07:32:18.972 --> 07:32:20.253]  I just want to bring something.
[07:32:20.334 --> 07:32:34.006]  I'm actually a first-time caller, but you know these people don't do anything by accident, so I'm sure that these bombs were probably already planted in the stands like in the seats or in the poles and also
[07:32:35.730 --> 07:32:44.117]  One thing to consider is that, you know, like these flags, they were, you know, in anticipation of this explosion, that these flags were arranged in a certain order.
[07:32:44.678 --> 07:32:55.827]  So I would say is that maybe pay attention to which flags were in front of the bombing, which could signal maybe, you know, their next move or, you know, what's to come.
[07:32:56.447 --> 07:32:59.570]  So, you know, kind of like, you know, during the Olympics.
[07:33:00.394 --> 07:33:01.615]  Uh, when they're singing the anthem.
[07:33:02.075 --> 07:33:06.257]  And in, at the part when it says, uh, you know, the flag will fall, then the flag falls.
[07:33:06.657 --> 07:33:06.897]  Yeah.
[07:33:06.957 --> 07:33:08.738]  So everything's, like, assigned to these people.
[07:33:08.798 --> 07:33:13.620]  So, um, I don't know, I just wanted to bring up the part about the, you know, keep an eye on the flags.
[07:33:14.420 --> 07:33:16.801]  Which flags went down, you know, so.
[07:33:16.821 --> 07:33:18.822]  Okay, yeah, we'll have to, we'll have to check out that video.
[07:33:18.842 --> 07:33:19.983]  Definitely appreciate your call.
[07:33:20.343 --> 07:33:22.364]  We'll go on to Brian in Pennsylvania.
[07:33:24.625 --> 07:33:25.085]  Brian, you there?
[07:33:26.345 --> 07:33:26.525]  Hello?
[07:33:27.026 --> 07:33:27.826]  Yes, Brian, go ahead.
[07:33:28.926 --> 07:33:30.147]  Thank you very much for taking my call.
[07:33:30.667 --> 07:33:44.338]  I just wanted to speak to the possibilities of total gun registration, and unfortunately these recent events make it only more relevant.
[07:33:44.418 --> 07:33:52.223]  As a professional in the computer industry, I work primarily on databases, on websites, backends, stuff like that.
[07:33:52.243 --> 07:33:53.264]  You might be familiar with that.
[07:33:56.288 --> 07:34:09.593]  One of the most common things I hear is, you know, 300 million or however many million gun owners in America is too large a number for our government to keep track of who owns what, who's buying ammunition, who owns what guns.
[07:34:11.153 --> 07:34:15.255]  But I just want to clear up any misconceptions with anybody that's listening right now.
[07:34:16.055 --> 07:34:25.138]  All it takes is a zero or a one next to your name in a big government database to identify you.
[07:34:26.101 --> 07:34:27.821]  As a gun owner, that's all it takes.
[07:34:28.222 --> 07:34:41.105]  That's absolutely true, and that's why we're so concerned about this, because as we mentioned earlier, with the advent of modern technology, they can implement a tyranny the likes of which this world has never, ever seen before.
[07:34:41.805 --> 07:34:49.967]  Coming online later this year is the Utah Data Center, and that data center just has an unbelievable amount of capacity.
[07:34:50.187 --> 07:34:50.887]  Right.
[07:34:51.027 --> 07:34:53.488]  Yodabytes, some people have said it's even more than that.
[07:34:54.168 --> 07:35:03.259]  But the goal is to catalogue and store every single phone conversation, every kind of communication, every text, messages, email, everything.
[07:35:03.720 --> 07:35:11.990]  Everything that you do electronically, any kind of electronic communication worldwide, they want to store and catalogue and they have the capacity to do that.
[07:35:12.450 --> 07:35:15.333]  And they're working on the capacity to data mine that.
[07:35:15.633 --> 07:35:16.053]  Exactly.
[07:35:16.073 --> 07:35:17.774]  To basically analyze it.
[07:35:17.815 --> 07:35:27.662]  To validate our caller's point, myself and Melissa Melton went to the NSA Data Mining Center in San Antonio, Texas, which they, you know, strategically build across the street from a Walmart.
[07:35:28.223 --> 07:35:33.007]  And we go and we meet one of the security guards and he says, hey, how'd you find out about this place?
[07:35:33.047 --> 07:35:34.128]  I said, man, it's on Google Earth.
[07:35:35.037 --> 07:35:40.121]  I mean, even if I didn't know what the building was, if I was somebody at the Walmart, I could just walk across the street.
[07:35:40.401 --> 07:35:41.402]  Hey, what are you guys doing in there?
[07:35:41.422 --> 07:35:44.585]  And they, you know, they freak out and, you know, swarmed on us with cars.
[07:35:44.625 --> 07:35:46.106]  But we definitely appreciate your call.
[07:35:46.526 --> 07:35:47.827]  Caller, we'll move on to our next one.
[07:35:47.847 --> 07:35:49.929]  That is Diane in South Carolina.
[07:35:53.132 --> 07:35:53.692]  Is it Blaine?
[07:35:53.712 --> 07:35:55.514]  Oh, I'm sorry, Blaine.
[07:35:55.574 --> 07:35:56.354]  Blaine, I'm sorry.
[07:35:56.374 --> 07:35:57.815]  Go ahead.
[07:35:58.196 --> 07:36:00.217]  I just had a couple of quick comments.
[07:36:01.832 --> 07:36:22.246]  The footage I've seen on Fox and everything, it's just, and someone spoke on Steven Spielberg being there, the footage of the bombs exploding and those flags, you know, and the people in uniform running out there as soon as it happens, that's not a big giveaway to this?
[07:36:22.266 --> 07:36:26.529]  Can you go into more detail of what you're making?
[07:36:26.729 --> 07:36:27.349]  Yeah, go ahead.
[07:36:27.669 --> 07:36:28.370]  Why is that a giveaway?
[07:36:29.941 --> 07:36:35.813]  I mean, you see people in military uniforms at a race, you know?
[07:36:36.094 --> 07:36:37.798]  As soon as a bomb goes off, just...
[07:36:38.959 --> 07:36:39.760]  They just rush in.
[07:36:40.100 --> 07:36:41.281]  Yeah, I get what you're saying.
[07:36:41.421 --> 07:36:43.783]  They rush in without really assessing the situation.
[07:36:44.083 --> 07:36:47.926]  And I'm looking at the current counter, we have said 132 injured now.
[07:36:47.986 --> 07:36:48.646]  Wow.
[07:36:50.107 --> 07:36:51.969]  Yeah, I do agree with what you're saying, Collin.
[07:36:52.009 --> 07:37:00.415]  It's very suspicious to me, especially people who may not, I'm guessing these people are just normal police or medics or whoever who aren't trained in bomb disposal.
[07:37:00.836 --> 07:37:05.039]  And I thought it was very strange as well that people would just rush into the situation.
[07:37:05.399 --> 07:37:07.001]  But that may be part of their training.
[07:37:07.021 --> 07:37:12.146]  I guess the other part of it, though, is that, you know, we just see police and military everywhere.
[07:37:12.707 --> 07:37:17.292]  I mean, and that's what they're conditioning people to do that, and that's what we're going to be living under.
[07:37:17.632 --> 07:37:23.698]  We're going to wind up in a situation where, like in Eastern Germany, over half of the people we're informing were informants.
[07:37:23.739 --> 07:37:26.942]  We're going to wind up in a situation where over half of the people were informants.
[07:37:27.122 --> 07:37:27.362]  Yeah.
[07:37:57.282 --> 07:38:00.283]  Oh, I just, oh man, uh, thank you for taking my call.
[07:38:00.363 --> 07:38:01.684]  Long time fan, never called in.
[07:38:02.304 --> 07:38:11.907]  Anyway, I just wanted to say, I wanted to switch up the topic a little bit and say, what, if this is everything the government says it is and all everybody says it is, what is the point?
[07:38:12.447 --> 07:38:13.448]  What do they get out of it?
[07:38:13.808 --> 07:38:15.188]  What, I mean, what is the motive?
[07:38:15.668 --> 07:38:18.029]  When you do something, you're like, you're a terrorist.
[07:38:18.069 --> 07:38:23.231]  You have, you have, you know, you have things you need them, you know, you're asking for it.
[07:38:23.251 --> 07:38:23.851]  You see what I'm saying?
[07:38:24.231 --> 07:38:26.572]  Yeah, this is a crime without an apparent motive, right?
[07:38:27.529 --> 07:38:28.809]  I mean, like, what do they get out of it?
[07:38:28.829 --> 07:38:30.730]  They just bomb international places?
[07:38:30.790 --> 07:38:34.010]  I mean, even if it... I mean, anyway, I just thought that was really interesting.
[07:38:34.090 --> 07:38:35.971]  I'm, you know, getting a lot of local news.
[07:38:36.011 --> 07:38:37.731]  I was watching it, like, the second it happened.
[07:38:37.771 --> 07:38:41.732]  It came on, and it's just interesting how they give you little bits at a time.
[07:38:41.752 --> 07:38:47.773]  The information I heard... Definitely heard, on the news here, I heard, trigger gun control.
[07:38:47.793 --> 07:38:49.133]  That was one of the words that came up.
[07:38:49.173 --> 07:38:50.173]  That definitely was said.
[07:38:50.613 --> 07:38:52.814]  And then I also heard them say, the CIA is here.
[07:38:52.974 --> 07:38:54.354]  And this was within 15 minutes.
[07:38:55.354 --> 07:38:55.995]  Yeah, it was there.
[07:38:56.055 --> 07:39:00.960]  Now as far as what they get, I'll give you my take and then David you can elaborate if you wish.
[07:39:01.380 --> 07:39:15.174]  As far as what they get, I don't know if they have any plans to, let's say this guy is a Saudi, I'm not saying they're gonna go over there and you know mess around with those people, but domestically what they get is to roll out their TSA Viper teams, their checkpoints, their pat-downs and such.
[07:39:15.234 --> 07:39:17.676]  Is that, that's what I think they'd get domestically.
[07:39:17.736 --> 07:39:18.537]  David, do you have any thoughts?
[07:39:19.161 --> 07:39:27.566]  Well, I think what the caller is talking about is, you know, when you have a crime committed, a detective goes out and he looks at it and says, well, who benefits from this person's murder, right?
[07:39:27.906 --> 07:39:32.089]  Because so many times a murder is from somebody that knows them or their immediate family.
[07:39:32.529 --> 07:39:38.032]  And so we look at this and we say, you know, how does this benefit the so-called right-wing terrorists, the anti-government people?
[07:39:38.092 --> 07:39:42.675]  Why would they target, as Alex mentioned earlier, why would they target a crowd
[07:39:43.896 --> 07:39:49.041]  I mean, we had the guy who was angry at the IRS here in Austin.
[07:39:49.061 --> 07:39:51.564]  They flew a plane into the IRS building or whatever.
[07:39:51.964 --> 07:40:02.956]  But, you know, this doesn't seem to fit the narrative that they're trying to force on it within the media and the government of being a right-wing, because a right-wing terrorist doesn't have anything to gain from this.
[07:40:03.656 --> 07:40:05.056]  There's no motive there, I think.
[07:40:05.076 --> 07:40:06.277]  Was that what you were saying, Collin?
[07:40:06.297 --> 07:40:08.277]  Yeah, I think I misunderstood what he was saying.
[07:40:08.377 --> 07:40:09.717]  Okay, he's gone now.
[07:40:09.857 --> 07:40:11.058]  I think you answered it right.
[07:40:11.338 --> 07:40:12.298]  I misunderstood what he was saying.
[07:40:12.318 --> 07:40:13.418]  We've got John in Wisconsin.
[07:40:13.438 --> 07:40:13.998]  John, are you there?
[07:40:16.619 --> 07:40:17.099]  Go ahead, John.
[07:40:18.259 --> 07:40:19.719]  John from Wisconsin?
[07:40:20.059 --> 07:40:20.920]  John in Wisconsin?
[07:40:21.200 --> 07:40:21.360]  Yeah.
[07:40:21.800 --> 07:40:22.320]  Yeah, that's me.
[07:40:22.580 --> 07:40:23.260]  Hey, go ahead.
[07:40:23.280 --> 07:40:24.260]  Hey, listen.
[07:40:24.380 --> 07:40:32.462]  I've been watching Facebook and, you know, one eye on Facebook and one eye on the TV, and somebody had posted something on my Facebook page.
[07:40:33.496 --> 07:40:42.829]  It's kind of, you know, interesting in the fact that he mentions that DHS was doing this
[07:40:44.861 --> 07:40:52.808]  Okay, so when Sandy Hook's shooting happened, DHS just happened to be in Newtown participating in an active shooter drill.
[07:40:53.169 --> 07:40:53.429]  Right.
[07:40:53.609 --> 07:40:58.574]  Now, it turns out that DHS is in Boston participating in a controlled explosion drill.
[07:40:59.034 --> 07:41:01.456]  Yeah, well, I'm hearing about these drills.
[07:41:01.496 --> 07:41:06.601]  I believe the drill we heard about earlier was a police drill, but you're saying that DHS is having a drill or had a drill?
[07:41:07.502 --> 07:41:07.602]  Yeah.
[07:41:07.642 --> 07:41:09.324]  Do they have a source for that?
[07:41:10.738 --> 07:41:16.804]  No, I heard on Fox, I believe it was, or CNN, that New York City went on alert.
[07:41:16.844 --> 07:41:26.474]  They have some suspicious things going on and they're sending the terrorist control or the crowd control armored vehicles out in the streets.
[07:41:27.034 --> 07:41:31.879]  Now, in that article you saw on Facebook, did they have a source saying that it was DHS involved in a drill?
[07:41:32.975 --> 07:41:38.938]  No, that's just a comment from somebody on Facebook.
[07:41:38.958 --> 07:41:56.586]  That's what we're trying to ascertain at the moment, is we're trying to determine whether this was police sweeping the area, obviously ineffective, or was this some kind of a bomb drill, and then of course if it was a drill, that's different, and if it was a DHS drill, that's very different.
[07:41:56.907 --> 07:41:57.127]  Yeah.
[07:41:57.307 --> 07:41:58.668]  So yeah, we'll be looking at that.
[07:41:58.888 --> 07:42:01.489]  Okay, we'll move on to our next... I'm sorry, go ahead, finish your thought.
[07:42:02.737 --> 07:42:11.460]  They had bomb sniffing dogs in the area and they were saying that there's going to be a drill of some kind in the area.
[07:42:12.180 --> 07:42:13.961]  Since when did they start using real bombs?
[07:42:14.681 --> 07:42:14.901]  Right.
[07:42:15.501 --> 07:42:17.262]  Well, thank you for calling.
[07:42:17.742 --> 07:42:18.282]  We're going to jump.
[07:42:18.302 --> 07:42:19.983]  We're trying to get to all our callers here.
[07:42:20.083 --> 07:42:21.683]  Is that Kurt in Texas?
[07:42:21.743 --> 07:42:22.444]  Alright, come on.
[07:42:24.044 --> 07:42:24.965]  Hey, how's it going guys?
[07:42:25.225 --> 07:42:25.785]  Going very well.
[07:42:28.350 --> 07:42:29.951]  Just a quick quote.
[07:42:30.391 --> 07:42:32.071]  Never let a good crisis go to waste.
[07:42:32.611 --> 07:42:34.071]  Yeah, we know who said that.
[07:42:34.632 --> 07:42:36.232]  That's a position the government's going to take.
[07:42:36.292 --> 07:42:56.336]  But one thing I thought was kind of strange was how quickly, you know, if there's no legitimacy to, you know, it being a false flag, why was it that some of these big media outlets immediately tried to shoot down Alex's claim?
[07:42:57.592 --> 07:42:57.973]  Absolutely.
[07:42:58.353 --> 07:42:59.993]  Well, they've been building on this as well.
[07:43:00.033 --> 07:43:02.014]  They've been creating the narrative now for a couple of weeks.
[07:43:02.074 --> 07:43:12.519]  As we pointed out, Peter Bergen at CNN, back April the 5th, he made a lot of, you know, trying to redirect everybody from Islamic terrorists to domestic terrorists.
[07:43:12.639 --> 07:43:19.803]  And, of course, domestic terrorists for him are people who talk about the Constitution and liberty and that sort of thing.
[07:43:19.823 --> 07:43:22.524]  So this is something that it's been moving in that way for quite some time.
[07:43:23.124 --> 07:43:24.926]  And that's why Alex has been talking about it.
[07:43:25.206 --> 07:43:25.486]  Exactly.
[07:43:25.506 --> 07:43:28.669]  Because we see all this stuff building on a day-to-day basis.
[07:43:28.729 --> 07:43:39.358]  We see every few days another leaked document from someone in the military demonizing Christians and conservatives and people who talk about the Constitution-limited government.
[07:43:41.320 --> 07:43:45.243]  Yeah, and I think this is just one more example that shows that we are the majority.
[07:43:45.263 --> 07:43:46.284]  We're not the minority.
[07:43:46.304 --> 07:43:49.607]  If we were the extreme minority, they would just ignore us.
[07:43:50.407 --> 07:43:56.509]  Within minutes, you know, you got major news media coming out saying, oh that's crazy, and you know.
[07:43:57.149 --> 07:44:00.270]  So obviously they're trying to engage in some type of damage control.
[07:44:00.530 --> 07:44:01.531]  Absolutely, exactly.
[07:44:01.951 --> 07:44:03.631]  We got a caller from Paris, France.
[07:44:03.871 --> 07:44:05.572]  Yes, Rob in Paris, France.
[07:44:06.092 --> 07:44:08.213]  What's your comment and your thought about this?
[07:44:09.011 --> 07:44:16.534]  Hi guys, I wanted to tell you I really appreciate you, really enjoy your program and I'm a first-time caller.
[07:44:17.715 --> 07:44:33.842]  I had just went to the store and saw the television and the news on the television, came straight back to my house and of course went to InfoWars.com and one of the comments there, someone had said that
[07:44:34.842 --> 07:44:40.549]  You know, there they go, CNN's already talking, you know, right wing and all this kind of stuff.
[07:44:40.589 --> 07:44:41.990]  So I turned on CNN.
[07:44:42.431 --> 07:44:51.682]  One of the things that you guys might have missed in the disclosure of information interview that CNN was doing with the police commissioner and the mayor,
[07:44:53.343 --> 07:44:59.167]  I don't have the terminology exactly, but you guys, I'm sure somebody's got a copy of that tape somewhere.
[07:45:00.068 --> 07:45:11.576]  If you play that back, when someone asked him about, the commissioner, about the bombing drills, his response was that they had been drilling for this
[07:45:12.296 --> 07:45:13.617]  We're good to go.
[07:45:40.172 --> 07:45:45.654]  That comment, but definitely we'll look into that statement that he's been drilling for this situation all day.
[07:45:46.094 --> 07:45:51.955]  So we're gonna take a short break and we'll be back, but definitely remember Alex Jones at 7 p.m.
[07:45:52.435 --> 07:45:54.656]  Central Sharp, the InfoWars Nightly News.
[07:45:54.696 --> 07:46:01.238]  You can stay right here on InfoWars4slashListen or head over to PrisonPlanet.tv, but we'll be right back after a short break.
[07:46:04.073 --> 07:46:08.335]  Hey guys, Leanne McAdoo here at the Austin, Texas InfoWars News Center.
[07:46:08.716 --> 07:46:14.279]  Our East Coast reporter, Dan Badondi, is on the scene and he was able to get in this question at the news conference.
[07:46:14.899 --> 07:46:16.640]  We are looking at all of that right now.
[07:46:16.660 --> 07:46:18.601]  That's one of the investigative steps that we're taking.
[07:46:19.001 --> 07:46:21.443]  As I said earlier, there was no specific intelligence
[07:46:33.189 --> 07:46:38.072]  Now we've got that story on our InfoWars.com website and you can check it out, follow up with more.
[07:46:51.357 --> 07:47:08.405]  Absolutely folks, it's all breaking there and a live feed is at InfoWars.com forward slash listen, a live video feed is there for everyone with Jakari Jackson, David Knight, myself and the rest of the crew, Rob Dew, John Bowne,
[07:47:10.185 --> 07:47:20.752]  The entire crew here, Adon Salazar, Kurt Nemo, they're all there right now covering all of this and Leanne McAdoo is also on top of it as well.
[07:47:20.852 --> 07:47:26.276]  So this is a big deal ladies and gentlemen because so many of these past events have been false flags.
[07:47:26.296 --> 07:47:33.981]  We've got to study this and see if it is because they want to have this total rollout of the police state an excuse to carry that out.
[07:47:34.682 --> 07:47:36.063]  Leanne, what else are you working on?
[07:47:37.213 --> 07:47:40.656]  Well, I've got some stories coming up about the drone strikes.
[07:47:41.096 --> 07:47:45.099]  Obama had just flat out lied about how many people had been struck with the drones.
[07:47:45.179 --> 07:47:47.721]  Maybe that's why we got this, to distract people.
[07:47:49.116 --> 07:47:49.856]  Alright, great job.
[07:47:49.876 --> 07:47:50.976]  Dude, what else are you working on?
[07:47:51.317 --> 07:47:56.858]  Well, I'm going to try to follow up and see what happened with my brother-in-law, who was actually running in the marathon.
[07:47:57.038 --> 07:47:57.738]  For the Army?
[07:47:57.918 --> 07:47:58.438]  For the Army.
[07:47:58.478 --> 07:47:59.338]  He's in intelligence.
[07:47:59.378 --> 07:48:00.279]  Tell folks what happened with him.
[07:48:00.519 --> 07:48:00.779]  Right.
[07:48:01.019 --> 07:48:04.000]  And apparently he got pulled out early of the race.
[07:48:04.040 --> 07:48:05.140]  They said he was dehydrated.
[07:48:05.660 --> 07:48:07.520]  So, I'm trying to get a hold of him right now.
[07:48:07.600 --> 07:48:08.801]  I've been throwing text messages.
[07:48:08.821 --> 07:48:10.321]  You've got to go to the hospital.
[07:48:10.401 --> 07:48:11.041]  They came to him.
[07:48:11.141 --> 07:48:11.301]  Right.
[07:48:11.321 --> 07:48:14.082]  They pulled him out of the race, sent him to the hospital, said he was dehydrated.
[07:48:14.862 --> 07:48:15.723]  Wasn't that nice?
[07:48:15.823 --> 07:48:20.767]  In fact, Leeann, search engine real quick, Mayor Willie Brown got warning not to fly on 9-11.
[07:48:21.068 --> 07:48:21.308]  Right.
[07:48:21.508 --> 07:48:23.650]  It's the second link San Francisco Chronicle.
[07:48:23.690 --> 07:48:29.855]  Condoleezza Rice actually warned and gave him a phone call, personal phone call, which he said he didn't make much, didn't think much of it then.
[07:48:29.895 --> 07:48:37.842]  You know, when the Secretary of the National Security calls you and tells you not to fly, I guess it's not a big deal.
[07:48:38.082 --> 07:48:39.643]  You know, so there you go.
[07:48:39.683 --> 07:48:42.105]  And now we also have reports of the U of M coach,
[07:48:43.206 --> 07:48:45.807]  The cross-country coach said that... They had loudspeakers.
[07:48:45.827 --> 07:48:47.528]  Yeah, that's up on Infowars.com.
[07:48:47.628 --> 07:48:47.848]  Right.
[07:48:48.108 --> 07:48:55.450]  They had loudspeakers on there openly announcing, hey, it's just a drill, don't worry about the dogs.
[07:48:56.030 --> 07:49:00.632]  And then you can also go to, again, yeah, that's a saved version.
[07:49:00.672 --> 07:49:03.513]  Willie Brown got low-key warning not to travel.
[07:49:03.553 --> 07:49:07.514]  But if you actually go back, and good job finding that live here on the fly.
[07:49:07.534 --> 07:49:09.115]  We're basically taping this live.
[07:49:09.870 --> 07:49:11.391]  There it is, San Francisco Chronicle.
[07:49:11.851 --> 07:49:12.351]  Boom!
[07:49:12.992 --> 07:49:17.014]  Willie Brown got low-key early warning about air travel.
[07:49:17.054 --> 07:49:20.396]  And again, the Joint Chiefs of Staff are supposed to fly to New York, and we're told not to.
[07:49:20.796 --> 07:49:21.837]  I mean, this is incredible.
[07:49:21.897 --> 07:49:31.442]  And again, if your brother, or your brother-in-law, your wife's brother, again, you say he's a great marathon guy, runs 10 miles before breakfast, you name it.
[07:49:31.822 --> 07:49:32.102]  Boom!
[07:49:32.122 --> 07:49:32.723]  This happens.
[07:49:32.803 --> 07:49:33.623]  Very suspicious.
[07:49:33.643 --> 07:49:35.984]  We need to ask him, you know, were you really, quote, sick?
[07:49:36.044 --> 07:49:36.905]  Why'd they pull you out?
[07:49:37.065 --> 07:49:37.225]  Right.
[07:49:37.265 --> 07:49:39.567]  I know you're getting the second hand through your wife who talked to him.
[07:49:39.867 --> 07:49:42.069]  Alright, well that's it for this report.
[07:49:42.109 --> 07:49:48.133]  Great job to the entire crew, and great job doing the work you're doing, and great job to all the listeners getting us the tips.
[07:49:48.173 --> 07:49:51.696]  Follow us at Twitter at RealAlexJones, ladies and gentlemen.
[07:49:51.996 --> 07:49:57.000]  The investigation continues, because you better believe they're not going to let this crisis go to waste.
[07:50:00.563 --> 07:50:05.827]  Hi, I'm Janet Napolitano, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.
[07:50:06.792 --> 07:50:10.055]  Homeland security begins with hometown security.
[07:50:15.059 --> 07:50:24.988]  It seems apparent that our citizens are staying off the streets, which may make scoring particularly difficult, even with this year's rule changes.
[07:50:25.048 --> 07:50:28.471]  To recap those revisions, women
[07:50:29.773 --> 07:50:33.395]  ...are still worth 10 points more than men in all age brackets.
[07:50:34.096 --> 07:50:42.661]  But teenagers now rack up 40 points, and toddlers under 12 now rate a big 70 points.
[07:50:42.861 --> 07:50:51.647]  The big score, anyone, any sex, over 75 years old, has been upped to 100 points.
[07:50:52.787 --> 07:50:58.711]  As always, how fast you move determines how long you live.
[07:51:02.884 --> 07:51:06.414]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[07:51:07.015 --> 07:51:08.740]  It's Alex Jones!
[07:51:14.697 --> 07:51:27.160]  And of course, that was a promo that we had that goes back to those targets that DHS had ordered of pregnant women, elderly men, and children that they were using, that they especially ordered from that one company that we had.
[07:51:27.180 --> 07:51:30.061]  Yeah, and then the company said that they're sorry that you found them.
[07:51:30.301 --> 07:51:34.983]  That we're sorry this information went public, not sorry we make them, and we'll probably continue to make them.
[07:51:36.798 --> 07:51:42.961]  Just a reminder to our viewers, our listeners, we will be going to the Nightly News Show with Alex Jones at 7.05.
[07:51:44.342 --> 07:51:45.402]  That is Central Time.
[07:51:45.862 --> 07:51:49.024]  So definitely stay here for that upcoming information.
[07:51:49.044 --> 07:51:57.468]  You can find out on PrisonPlanet.tv as well as InfoWars.com forward slash listen and big... Right now we got Jay in New York.
[07:51:57.588 --> 07:52:00.570]  Yeah, I just wanted to give a little round of applause to the radio crew.
[07:52:00.610 --> 07:52:03.052]  These guys are working over overtime.
[07:52:03.313 --> 07:52:04.373]  Yeah, it's been a long day for them.
[07:52:04.473 --> 07:52:04.874]  Indeed.
[07:52:05.174 --> 07:52:05.574]  Indeed.
[07:52:05.774 --> 07:52:07.276]  Okay, so Jay in New York.
[07:52:07.456 --> 07:52:07.756]  Thank you.
[07:52:08.957 --> 07:52:09.397]  Jay, you there?
[07:52:10.138 --> 07:52:10.758]  Hi, hello?
[07:52:11.039 --> 07:52:11.179]  Yes.
[07:52:12.632 --> 07:52:17.056]  I think this is a distraction as far as what they're doing right now.
[07:52:17.677 --> 07:52:22.301]  A lot of times what's happening is that we actually always react to what's happening.
[07:52:22.801 --> 07:52:26.084]  Just like a news media, whenever something happens, everybody jumps on it.
[07:52:26.164 --> 07:52:32.590]  But two days ago, I actually watched a Korean TV and they were talking about the U.S.
[07:52:32.690 --> 07:52:35.812]  is actually going to introduce a new $100 bill.
[07:52:37.905 --> 07:52:40.806]  And I was looking through that, I was like, something is really going to happen.
[07:52:40.846 --> 07:52:44.468]  I had a sixth sense that something was going to happen.
[07:52:45.328 --> 07:52:51.290]  And I was looking at my silver charts and everything, and silver and gold has been dropping like crazy for the past two days.
[07:52:51.550 --> 07:52:52.751]  Yeah, that's what our callers say.
[07:52:53.291 --> 07:52:56.713]  So I was actually speculating, something's going to happen today.
[07:52:56.733 --> 07:52:58.913]  And this is exactly what happened.
[07:52:58.953 --> 07:53:02.695]  So instead of following through what's really happening right now,
[07:53:03.464 --> 07:53:10.908]  But we have to actually foresee it so that we could stop this kind of, you know, nonsensical, uh, fly app or false flag or whatever.
[07:53:11.489 --> 07:53:17.272]  I think they're actually creating this so that people are focused on today's event while they're going to do something other.
[07:53:17.933 --> 07:53:18.453]  Very good point.
[07:53:18.573 --> 07:53:18.733]  Yeah.
[07:53:18.893 --> 07:53:21.074]  We've, we've talked about what's happening right now.
[07:53:21.154 --> 07:53:28.239]  So I think there might be some kind of a, uh, maybe bank holiday, something that's going to be unfolding itself pretty soon or something.
[07:53:28.259 --> 07:53:28.299]  Uh,
[07:53:29.518 --> 07:53:30.119]  Absolutely.
[07:53:30.259 --> 07:53:30.579]  Absolutely.
[07:53:53.013 --> 07:54:05.165]  And as we've seen, as you mentioned, not only is it the gold and silver market, but it's also the Bitcoin market, which is all these different currencies which are competitors to these fiat central bank currencies.
[07:54:05.206 --> 07:54:09.110]  They've all been plunging all at once, and that is very suspicious.
[07:54:09.150 --> 07:54:12.914]  We talked about that earlier, and it's something bears watching.
[07:54:12.954 --> 07:54:14.215]  But just remember, you know, that
[07:54:15.316 --> 07:54:23.141]  When they talk about the price of gold, the real value of gold is being floated around like in a speculative marketplace.
[07:54:23.201 --> 07:54:25.463]  But, you know, gold has a fixed value.
[07:54:26.083 --> 07:54:30.286]  And they can play around with it by, you know, selling off masses amounts of it.
[07:54:30.586 --> 07:54:35.029]  But if you've got your gold, you've got something of real value that you can hang on to.
[07:54:35.069 --> 07:54:41.113]  And I definitely agree with the caller that these things are often used as a smokescreen to distract from other issues.
[07:54:41.153 --> 07:54:42.094]  You know, they may try to
[07:54:42.814 --> 07:54:43.695]  Hi, thanks for taking the call.
[07:55:08.300 --> 07:55:26.344]  Notice that a young man, well an older gentleman, a gentleman named Arradondo, who was quite an activist in the anti-war and Occupy movement, whose son died in Iraq, was on less than any CNN, New England cable network.
[07:55:27.063 --> 07:55:27.364]  I don't
[07:55:40.094 --> 07:55:45.216]  I think that they'll be able to connect Patriots, because why would a Patriot ever do something on Patriots Day?
[07:55:45.276 --> 07:55:47.016]  I mean, that's so pathetically stupid.
[07:55:47.657 --> 07:55:51.898]  Even the stupid ones, even the idiots won't register that as true.
[07:55:51.998 --> 07:55:53.579]  So, I mean, that's another story.
[07:55:53.599 --> 07:56:09.464]  But I think the important thing that we could do as InfoWars-type people, could we have seminars where you guys go around to different areas and orient us after we've taken kind of like a little training course and videos and answered some questions, and then you could come around and
[07:56:10.004 --> 07:56:10.805]  That's a good idea.
[07:56:25.188 --> 07:56:30.132]  Planet Info Wars, where people will organize locally around a particular issue, or just organize.
[07:56:30.712 --> 07:56:39.219]  Back in the area that I lived in, we didn't even have Alex on the radio, but we had Planet Info Wars people organized to fight fluoridation in the water, as well as other things.
[07:56:39.259 --> 07:56:41.961]  So that's a good starting place at the moment.
[07:56:42.742 --> 07:56:46.565]  But probably rather than traveling around, we would want to do something live on the internet.
[07:56:47.405 --> 07:56:53.910]  You know, the point that you made at the beginning about there really isn't any motivation for right-wing people, and that's clear.
[07:56:54.110 --> 07:56:54.490]  There isn't.
[07:56:55.051 --> 07:56:56.352]  Why would they do something like this?
[07:56:56.452 --> 07:57:06.319]  And yet, it makes it all the more interesting that the mainstream media would jump on right-wing people as being the suspects when there is no motivation to connect them to this whatsoever.
[07:57:06.459 --> 07:57:08.760]  I mean, immediately you heard Wolf Blitzer talking about it.
[07:57:09.180 --> 07:57:10.901]  But there's no motivation.
[07:57:11.522 --> 07:57:20.886]  This is not, I mean, if they're going to paint these people as being rabidly anti-government and hating government, how does blowing up people at a Boston Marathon, how does that get at the government?
[07:57:20.926 --> 07:57:22.847]  It doesn't do anything but strengthen the government.
[07:57:22.887 --> 07:57:25.989]  They're the only ones who would possibly benefit from a crisis such as this.
[07:57:26.263 --> 07:57:32.386]  Yeah, and I mean, to the callers, you know, why would a right-wing extremist go out and do something like that?
[07:57:32.626 --> 07:57:33.946]  I don't think that's necessarily the case.
[07:57:34.687 --> 07:57:50.093]  If it does turn out to be a, let's say, a false flag situation, which, you know, we're still not sure either way, but if it is a false flag situation, it doesn't matter what the, quote, motivation is for the person, for the Patsy, it's just that they went out there and did it.
[07:57:50.153 --> 07:57:50.313]  Right.
[07:57:51.994 --> 07:58:00.540]  As far as the information available, I don't have any reason to believe it was a right winger as of yet, but you know, only time will tell.
[07:58:01.121 --> 07:58:02.382]  That's right, only time will tell.
[07:58:02.862 --> 07:58:04.903]  And we'll move on to Steve from Ohio.
[07:58:07.145 --> 07:58:08.146]  Oh, that's Idaho, sir.
[07:58:08.366 --> 07:58:08.746]  I'm sorry.
[07:58:09.587 --> 07:58:12.549]  Oh, but yeah, I'm former Army.
[07:58:12.629 --> 07:58:16.612]  I went to EOD school down in Eglin Air Force Base, Florida.
[07:58:17.601 --> 07:58:35.529]  And while I was training there, and I also have another point too, we were trained and told that, you know, you will be at sporting events, you will be at, you know, inaugurations, you will be at these big events, you're just not going to be in uniform, you'll be in plain clothes, or, you know, you may be in uniform.
[07:58:35.589 --> 07:58:42.892]  So I honestly believe that there was an Army EOD team on site, which
[07:58:44.266 --> 07:58:49.169]  They're also trained to, you know, explode the bombs, but they're also trained to build them.
[07:58:49.290 --> 07:58:50.851]  So, you know, they could have done it on site.
[07:58:51.371 --> 07:59:01.578]  The other thing is, if you're going into, you know, all the ammo shortages and stuff, maybe they're trying to use this to, you know, regulate gunpowder so they can control it later on.
[07:59:02.039 --> 07:59:06.662]  So then, you know, the people that reload their own ammunition won't be able to, you know.
[07:59:08.126 --> 07:59:12.669]  Yeah, now I'm sorry, we had a little bit of audio difficulty at the beginning of your call.
[07:59:12.929 --> 07:59:17.332]  Did you say you were actually with the Explosive Ordnance Group, or you've trained to do that?
[07:59:18.373 --> 07:59:19.974]  I was in the EOD school.
[07:59:20.054 --> 07:59:28.620]  I didn't make it all the way through, but I did go to Army EOD school at Glenn Air Force Base, Florida.
[07:59:29.521 --> 07:59:35.545]  And as we've mentioned before, we know from the Oklahoma City bombing that a retired general who was in charge of demolition
[07:59:36.337 --> 07:59:41.360]  Said that there wasn't any way that a single bomb was going to create a bomb blast like that.
[07:59:41.380 --> 07:59:46.703]  That's one of the key things that came out of the research after the fact of that particular bombing.
[07:59:46.743 --> 07:59:48.564]  So it bears watching.
[07:59:48.904 --> 07:59:54.407]  Yeah, now since we have you on the line, and I know you said you didn't make it all the way through school, but maybe you learned a thing or two.
[07:59:55.328 --> 07:59:59.490]  What kind of household items could they use to make the type of explosions that we saw today?
[08:00:00.743 --> 08:00:05.164]  There was a quote, and this is a very famous quote for an EOD technician.
[08:00:05.224 --> 08:00:07.285]  Radio Shack is an EOD tech's worst friend.
[08:00:08.045 --> 08:00:08.565]  Worst enemy.
[08:00:10.105 --> 08:00:10.565]  Anything.
[08:00:11.026 --> 08:00:11.866]  I mean, ammonia.
[08:00:12.566 --> 08:00:13.246]  You name it.
[08:00:14.306 --> 08:00:26.149]  The other thing I wanted to say is when this happened, you know, regionally in some areas there may have been internet shortages because we lost our internet signals for 10 to 15 minutes here.
[08:00:26.969 --> 08:00:28.750]  So maybe like a regional kill switch also.
[08:00:29.631 --> 08:00:30.192]  That's interesting.
[08:00:30.312 --> 08:00:32.775]  I wouldn't have thought that it would affect... You're in Idaho, is that correct?
[08:00:33.536 --> 08:00:33.736]  Yes.
[08:00:34.176 --> 08:00:40.284]  Yeah, I wouldn't have thought that it... I mean, I would expect that somewhere in the Northeast, but I wouldn't expect it to affect it all the way in Idaho.
[08:00:40.424 --> 08:00:40.964]  That's interesting.
[08:00:41.265 --> 08:00:41.385]  Okay.
[08:00:41.405 --> 08:00:44.348]  Yeah, well, we didn't have any internet difficulties here, but we got kind of a...
[08:00:46.407 --> 08:00:47.908]  We've got a pretty good connection.
[08:00:47.948 --> 08:00:49.189]  Alex likes to spend money on that.
[08:00:49.449 --> 08:00:53.971]  And speaking of Alex, InfoWars Nightly News is now going to start at 7.10.
[08:00:54.671 --> 08:01:01.034]  So 7.10 central time, so you've got 10 minutes to get your pen and paper ready for the notes.
[08:01:01.094 --> 08:01:08.357]  I'm sure he's going to have a lot of details, new things that we may not even know because we're live on air, but he's got time to gather information.
[08:01:08.657 --> 08:01:10.778]  But in the meantime, you can give us a call at 877-789-ALEX.
[08:01:13.559 --> 08:01:20.349]  That's 877-789-ALEX or you can go to infowars.com forward slash listen if you just want to tune in.
[08:01:20.750 --> 08:01:23.354]  We'll go now to Tony in Kentucky.
[08:01:24.936 --> 08:01:25.276]  Hello.
[08:01:25.296 --> 08:01:26.638]  Hello, Tony.
[08:01:26.678 --> 08:01:26.899]  Go ahead.
[08:01:27.629 --> 08:01:43.673]  All right, I think you guys need to find, I actually got this through the grapevine, that while around the same time in Knoxville, Tennessee, the FBI locked down a pilot in Flying J headquarters this afternoon.
[08:01:43.693 --> 08:01:45.594]  They locked down a pilot where?
[08:01:46.997 --> 08:01:48.478]  It's in Knoxville, Tennessee.
[08:01:48.939 --> 08:01:54.322]  It's the headquarters for Pilot, the gas stations for truckers and Flying J. Yeah.
[08:01:54.482 --> 08:01:55.342]  They locked it down.
[08:01:55.382 --> 08:01:58.784]  They haven't given any news why it's been closed down.
[08:01:58.844 --> 08:02:02.366]  I just noticed I always think of a magic trick when you think about these types of things.
[08:02:02.767 --> 08:02:06.629]  You pay attention to the main hand and you got, you know, the Boston thing going on right now.
[08:02:07.049 --> 08:02:08.350]  And then on the other hand, you have this.
[08:02:09.050 --> 08:02:11.672]  However, pertaining to the Boston,
[08:02:12.563 --> 08:02:35.051]  uh... situation the boston situation they have pictures of people who are were at the initial blast and they see people on top of the building uh... that's in question yes i don't know who it is there's just been a lot of i don't know uh... fishy things going on within which we've heard from prior callers before this i just thought it should be known that uh... i have been trying to find a
[08:02:36.027 --> 08:02:40.370]  You know, credible news website for the Knoxville thing.
[08:02:40.390 --> 08:02:42.532]  The closest thing I could find was Knox News.
[08:02:43.873 --> 08:02:44.433]  Okay.
[08:02:44.733 --> 08:02:45.374]  Go ahead.
[08:02:45.894 --> 08:02:55.941]  Yeah, I'll just say, like, we had a caller, I believe one or two calls ago, who said that, you know, he wants to make a way for, you know, more people to get in touch and be able to coordinate these events.
[08:02:55.961 --> 08:03:00.825]  So my suggestion to you and anybody that's around the area, I believe you said Knoxville
[08:03:01.405 --> 08:03:10.908]  It's just to go out there, grab your camera, you know, whether you have a professional camera or you have a iPhone or whatever it is it may be, just go out there and film and, you know, put it up on YouTube.
[08:03:11.248 --> 08:03:21.032]  Because I definitely, like we've been saying all day today, you know, it's definitely a situation where there could be a slight of hand where they say, hey, focus over here, and meanwhile they have something else going on.
[08:03:21.052 --> 08:03:21.552]  That's right.
[08:03:23.096 --> 08:03:26.577]  It's really fishy to me that there's no information on what's going on.
[08:03:26.657 --> 08:03:36.981]  But then again, like I've said before, if everybody's paying attention to the Boston thing, which it should get the attention that it deserves because of the incident, the casualties that are at hand.
[08:03:37.061 --> 08:03:43.103]  But on the other hand, if something's going on there that we don't know about, we should also be hearing into that.
[08:03:43.743 --> 08:03:50.426]  I just thought I'd show some of that information or share some of that with you all because I know that information is power.
[08:03:50.886 --> 08:03:51.426]  Absolutely.
[08:03:52.040 --> 08:03:56.044]  And we all really need to be watching what's going on with the financial markets, as the previous caller said.
[08:03:56.064 --> 08:04:04.110]  And talking about fishy stuff, I mean, people on top of the building and everything, as one other caller pointed out, the very fact that this happened at the finish line.
[08:04:04.391 --> 08:04:04.631]  Right.
[08:04:04.731 --> 08:04:12.357]  I mean, of all places, you know, that would be the place where there is the most press and cameras.
[08:04:12.437 --> 08:04:14.679]  The place where you could be accidentally photographed.
[08:04:14.699 --> 08:04:17.682]  You know, they're trying to film the winner and they catch the guy behind them.
[08:04:17.762 --> 08:04:18.522]  Yeah, absolutely.
[08:04:18.562 --> 08:04:23.823]  But I mean, it would be the most difficult place for somebody to plant a bomb is right there at the finish line.
[08:04:23.943 --> 08:04:33.986]  And that we know that whether it was a drill or whether it was an active bomb scan or whatever, we know that there was a very heavy presence of the bomb squad there.
[08:04:34.126 --> 08:04:39.427]  And of course, for those people who want to go running to the government to protect them from every calamity, we need to remember that
[08:04:40.107 --> 08:04:42.968]  Uh, all these bomb squad guys didn't catch anything.
[08:04:43.268 --> 08:04:43.688]  Exactly.
[08:04:43.708 --> 08:04:44.648]  They did not.
[08:04:44.708 --> 08:04:45.689]  I mean, it's a concern.
[08:04:45.709 --> 08:04:49.030]  You know, not like, try not demonizing the police or whoever else is out there.
[08:04:49.050 --> 08:04:53.511]  No, but the point being is that the government cannot protect you from everything.
[08:04:53.531 --> 08:04:59.492]  I mean, they want to pretend as if they can eliminate all risks for us if we give up all of our freedoms.
[08:04:59.572 --> 08:05:01.113]  And the simple fact of the matter is, is that
[08:05:01.913 --> 08:05:02.373]  They can't.
[08:05:02.854 --> 08:05:22.205]  They can't find, even when they're looking for it, in the most obvious place, at the finish line, where they're going to be looking at it, and you've got the most press coverage still, supposedly, according to the official government narrative, somebody was able to sneak in there and hide it in the plain sight of everybody at the finish line, and all of their dogs and everything could not find it.
[08:05:22.425 --> 08:05:22.625]  Yeah.
[08:05:23.186 --> 08:05:25.207]  All their technology and resources.
[08:05:25.227 --> 08:05:28.149]  We'll go now to Tim in Texas.
[08:05:29.710 --> 08:05:29.890]  Hi.
[08:05:30.700 --> 08:05:31.420]  Oh, Tim, go ahead.
[08:05:31.561 --> 08:05:32.281]  How are you?
[08:05:32.301 --> 08:05:32.841]  Doing very well.
[08:05:33.001 --> 08:05:34.282]  Hi, how are you guys doing?
[08:05:34.302 --> 08:05:34.762]  Can you hear me?
[08:05:35.203 --> 08:05:35.583]  Yeah, great.
[08:05:35.703 --> 08:05:37.604]  Go ahead.
[08:05:37.644 --> 08:05:58.516]  I just wanted to key in on some of the key factors that have been spoken of just now about the fact of using these events to distract and also touching on the fact that those groups that are
[08:05:59.994 --> 08:06:11.512]  Perpetrating all these acts against the United States, I believe are trying to discredit the competence of the military who are there rushing in and of the police that were rushing in.
[08:06:12.659 --> 08:06:17.323]  So that's one of their points, I believe, in this specific act.
[08:06:17.783 --> 08:06:39.620]  But I want to get back to what is important is that I think the distractions and these things that the previous callers have mentioned about this being a distraction is to get shows like this one and other shows and other outlets to not fully engage in
[08:06:41.014 --> 08:06:47.696]  There's a term I want to throw out there that is commonly said, and it is that we defend the Constitution.
[08:06:48.917 --> 08:06:59.660]  And I think that they're scared stiff about someone getting on to the soundbite and to the reality of promoting the Constitution.
[08:07:00.720 --> 08:07:02.501]  And that is the action plan.
[08:07:02.681 --> 08:07:12.964]  And that can be spoken to in many different ways, just like these previous callers have just said about you go out your door and you do this or you do that to affect the situation.
[08:07:13.604 --> 08:07:22.687]  And I think that promoting the principles that we are saying that we're defending is the way we go on the offensive at all this.
[08:07:22.927 --> 08:07:25.868]  And I just want to get your take on that piece I just said.
[08:07:27.182 --> 08:07:27.823]  Well, absolutely.
[08:07:27.843 --> 08:07:32.027]  I think we need to promote it and defend the principles that are involved there.
[08:07:32.688 --> 08:07:34.110]  And part of that is education.
[08:07:34.290 --> 08:07:35.812]  I mean, that's what we're involved with.
[08:07:35.852 --> 08:07:38.475]  And part of it is understanding, even when we look at the gun issue,
[08:07:39.577 --> 08:07:41.617]  The Second Amendment is there to protect individual rights.
[08:07:41.677 --> 08:07:48.239]  I mean, look at the preface to the Bill of Rights, the ten amendments that came in, and it's clear from the wording of it that it's an individual right.
[08:07:48.319 --> 08:07:49.759]  But it even predates that.
[08:07:49.939 --> 08:07:54.240]  All the writings of the Federalists were about concerns about a standing army.
[08:07:54.420 --> 08:08:02.281]  And if you go to Article 1, Section 8, you'll see there that the military was not supposed to, the standing army was not supposed to be funded for more than two years at a time.
[08:08:02.301 --> 08:08:07.882]  There were provisions for Navy, and of course that would extend to the Air Force and space-based defense systems, that sort of thing.
[08:08:08.822 --> 08:08:30.869]  You know, that's the sort of thing that we just need to understand that, you know, this is, if we allow, if we allow people to have a, if we allow the government to set up a standing army, and we're getting a standing army not just with regular army now, but we're getting a domestic standing army in terms of homeland security, in terms of a federalized police force.
[08:08:31.570 --> 08:08:38.399]  These are things that we really need to understand the principles that are behind the Constitution, as well as actually read it.
[08:08:38.419 --> 08:08:41.223]  You know, read Article 1, Section 8, as well as the Second Amendment.
[08:08:41.583 --> 08:08:44.888]  Okay, Nightly News at 7.15 now, so we have time for one more.
[08:08:44.908 --> 08:08:46.330]  Sorry, you guys are talking in my ear.
[08:08:46.870 --> 08:09:11.993]  We have the nightly news now at 715 and actually I was live sir and I'll just give I'll give my quick comment to the to the caller I do agree that you know as far as the Constitution is we are often on the defense you know and if we could find some way to go on offense not a violent you know nothing to that sort but a way to go on the offense politically socially I think that would definitely be a
[08:09:12.233 --> 08:09:15.654]  You know, quite frankly, I think Ron Paul's new curriculum, I think he goes on the offense there.
[08:09:16.154 --> 08:09:25.578]  You know, he's got Tom Woods and other people who are basically going to be explaining things to students who are going to get a very different view of the Constitution than they did in school.
[08:09:25.638 --> 08:09:33.101]  I know I've had students tell me that they've been told by their teachers that the Second Amendment and the militia was essentially the National Guard.
[08:09:33.141 --> 08:09:35.422]  I mean, crazy stuff that they tell them.
[08:09:35.482 --> 08:09:37.863]  And they say that the Second Amendment is only for
[08:09:38.863 --> 08:09:41.425]  For the military and for the police and all that.
[08:09:42.006 --> 08:09:43.147]  Shotguns are luxury items.
[08:09:43.227 --> 08:09:44.268]  Alex Jones, back again.
[08:09:44.288 --> 08:09:46.089]  I'm getting ready to do the news here in a little while.
[08:09:46.710 --> 08:09:50.433]  I'm just scurrying around getting some more of my news articles together.
[08:09:50.453 --> 08:09:51.453]  So you guys go until about 7.20.
[08:09:52.875 --> 08:09:55.877]  I'll have the nightly news for everybody ready.
[08:09:55.897 --> 08:09:58.019]  You guys just kick some butt.
[08:09:58.479 --> 08:09:59.000]  Alright.
[08:10:00.341 --> 08:10:01.141]  Another call online?
[08:10:01.261 --> 08:10:03.904]  Yes, let's go now to Anne in Tennessee.
[08:10:05.305 --> 08:10:05.745]  Hello.
[08:10:06.225 --> 08:10:06.806]  Hello, Anne.
[08:10:08.027 --> 08:10:10.308]  Hi, I just wanted to mention two things.
[08:10:11.448 --> 08:10:25.312]  One, I was watching a little bit of the CNN coverage before I switched over to InfoWars, and the anchors on CNN were talking about who's in charge of this investigation, who's going to take point on it, and one of them said something interesting.
[08:10:25.352 --> 08:10:30.114]  They said, you know, it almost really doesn't matter who's in charge because we have a great fusion center here.
[08:10:31.034 --> 08:10:36.756]  And up until this point, I had really not heard them talk about that in the mainstream media, and it seemed like when Alex
[08:10:37.416 --> 08:10:38.598]  Yeah, it's not a bug, it's a feature now.
[08:10:52.879 --> 08:10:54.300]  Actually, literally a bug, right?
[08:10:55.261 --> 08:11:04.750]  So, to the caller's comment about the fusion centers and all these kind of data centers, you know, they let things slip out sometimes.
[08:11:04.830 --> 08:11:06.572]  I don't know if that was intentional or not.
[08:11:07.052 --> 08:11:11.256]  I mean, CNN, I'm very not, I wouldn't be very surprised if they were reading that off a teleprompter.
[08:11:12.277 --> 08:11:14.559]  Why they would let that slip out, I'm not exactly sure.
[08:11:14.579 --> 08:11:15.760]  You have any thoughts on that, David?
[08:11:16.321 --> 08:11:16.981]  Well, I don't know.
[08:11:17.102 --> 08:11:18.002]  I just think that, you know,
[08:11:19.062 --> 08:11:21.724]  Everything that they do, there comes a time at which they're going to make it public.
[08:11:22.505 --> 08:11:24.507]  They keep it secret for a while and then it rolls out.
[08:11:24.687 --> 08:11:37.618]  I mean, look at how rare and how guarded all of these internal positions on the military being used to put down domestic, you know, to be used for law enforcement throughout the US.
[08:11:38.533 --> 08:11:41.134]  When Alex was doing documentaries 10, 15 years ago.
[08:11:41.614 --> 08:11:43.395]  And look at how open they are about it now.
[08:11:43.835 --> 08:11:49.677]  You know, especially in the last couple of weeks, we've been seeing one article every other day coming out about somebody calling for this.
[08:11:49.717 --> 08:11:55.659]  So, there comes a time at which, you know, they prepare for this stuff and, you know, it goes through a stage.
[08:11:55.699 --> 08:11:57.740]  You know, some of these documents get leaked.
[08:11:57.840 --> 08:11:58.540]  We talk about it.
[08:11:58.720 --> 08:12:00.221]  We're crazy conspiracy theorists.
[08:12:00.281 --> 08:12:07.303]  And then, after a while, after they've prepared people or after they feel that they're confident enough in their position where they are, they make it public.
[08:12:07.423 --> 08:12:08.084]  They come out with it.
[08:12:08.104 --> 08:12:17.791]  So now may be the time that they're going to openly talk about these fusion centers because they are now going to use this attack to try to go to the next level.
[08:12:17.811 --> 08:12:24.697]  Okay, there is going to be something that is much deeper and broader than Homeland Security and the Patriot Act.
[08:12:24.757 --> 08:12:29.641]  I shudder to think what that's going to be, but they're going to come up with something and the fusion centers may be part of that.
[08:12:31.368 --> 08:12:32.909]  Any other comments?
[08:12:33.309 --> 08:12:37.910]  I'm sorry, the way those commentators mentioned it, I just said it like it was a very reassuring thing.
[08:12:38.351 --> 08:12:41.412]  Oh yeah, I have no doubt about that.
[08:12:41.472 --> 08:12:44.253]  They just rolled out there as something great.
[08:12:44.593 --> 08:12:48.454]  And you know, Alex always brings up the adage about the vampires.
[08:12:48.474 --> 08:12:50.895]  The vampires have to tell you what they're going to do before they do it.
[08:12:50.935 --> 08:12:53.956]  So, you know, they have a big news day and they'll just let something slip out.
[08:12:53.977 --> 08:12:54.917]  Yeah, we got fusion centers.
[08:12:54.937 --> 08:12:57.378]  But anyway, look at this bomb, it just blew up over here.
[08:12:58.178 --> 08:13:00.780]  So I definitely agree with that, and we have to jump fast.
[08:13:00.820 --> 08:13:04.303]  We appreciate your call, and we'll move to Dave in Chile.
[08:13:06.605 --> 08:13:07.125]  Hello there.
[08:13:07.145 --> 08:13:07.846]  Hi.
[08:13:09.507 --> 08:13:12.370]  Well, I'd like to say something about the Second Amendment.
[08:13:13.130 --> 08:13:15.692]  Nobody ever mentions this particular point.
[08:13:15.973 --> 08:13:18.975]  You know, everybody says it shall not be infringed.
[08:13:19.035 --> 08:13:22.678]  What part of it shall not be infringed do you not understand?
[08:13:22.998 --> 08:13:27.322]  But the thing is that the Second Amendment doesn't talk about guns.
[08:13:28.134 --> 08:13:29.154]  We talk about arms.
[08:13:29.534 --> 08:13:29.934]  That's right.
[08:13:30.274 --> 08:13:47.898]  So technically speaking, any American could have at his disposal a tank, he could have a knife, he could have a samurai sword, he could have a hatchet, he could be walking down the street and nobody should be able to say boo to him.
[08:13:48.838 --> 08:13:51.039]  So that's the point that I want to make.
[08:13:51.119 --> 08:13:57.160]  It's just that, it's the fact that there ain't nothing about guns in the Second Amendment.
[08:13:59.562 --> 08:14:14.399]  Exactly, and we always hear, that's a very good point, but you always hear the, my willingness to call it a counterpoint there, way to bat down that, you know, scenario, is they say, Dianne Feinstein would say, what about people, do you want people to have a bazooka?
[08:14:15.260 --> 08:14:18.043]  You know, do you want somebody to have, just like you said, do you want somebody to have a tank?
[08:14:18.063 --> 08:14:21.447]  Do you want somebody walking around down the street with a samurai sword?
[08:14:21.828 --> 08:14:23.389]  And just like you said, it's arms.
[08:14:23.650 --> 08:14:24.631]  And we talked about that earlier.
[08:14:24.671 --> 08:14:27.214]  We said, you know, at Lexington and Concord, they were coming for a cannon.
[08:14:28.215 --> 08:14:31.158]  Santa Ana wanted the cannon from the people at Gonzales.
[08:14:31.519 --> 08:14:32.019]  Right.
[08:14:32.059 --> 08:14:33.681]  You know, that is, it absolutely is.
[08:14:33.941 --> 08:14:35.123]  But here's the other part about that.
[08:14:35.623 --> 08:14:39.385]  Understand that it is not about just the guns, it is also about the ammunition.
[08:14:40.086 --> 08:14:44.989]  And they have been going after ammunition from the beginning of the Obama administration, and that's what we see.
[08:14:45.049 --> 08:14:55.095]  I believe that a lot of this 1.6 billion bullets and more that DHS has been getting options on and purchasing, I think part of that is to dry up the supply of ammunition.
[08:14:55.635 --> 08:15:00.937]  Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if they tried to outlaw making your own ammunition very soon.
[08:15:01.357 --> 08:15:03.978]  We're going to jump quick, we only have time for a couple more.
[08:15:04.279 --> 08:15:05.579]  Terry in Washington.
[08:15:05.599 --> 08:15:08.020]  Hey.
[08:15:08.380 --> 08:15:09.200]  Hey Terry.
[08:15:09.781 --> 08:15:11.962]  I'm doing fine, great show.
[08:15:12.462 --> 08:15:13.122]  Oh, thank you.
[08:15:14.102 --> 08:15:15.323]  I've got one question.
[08:15:16.763 --> 08:15:22.166]  At the finish line, it's a perfect place to have cameras, correct?
[08:15:24.022 --> 08:15:31.090]  If you look at that footage, you'll see a camera that's on a high rise.
[08:15:31.550 --> 08:15:34.493]  It's covered up and there's nothing there.
[08:15:35.140 --> 08:15:35.420]  Really?
[08:15:35.440 --> 08:15:44.348]  I noticed that and I was trying to see, I thought I could see almost like an outlined silhouette of something in the camera, in the box.
[08:15:44.828 --> 08:15:51.014]  I'm not sure if it was a person or if it was a camera or just bags or what it was, but I definitely noticed that as well.
[08:15:51.634 --> 08:15:58.280]  And from the angle that we keep seeing the footage, unless somebody releases a new angle, you can't exactly tell what's in there or not.
[08:15:59.229 --> 08:16:14.982]  It's going to be interesting to see what footage comes out of this because, you know, as Jakari mentioned earlier, when that plane supposedly hit the Pentagon or whatever it was that hit it,
[08:16:15.766 --> 08:16:19.769]  Uh, there are cameras all over the Pentagon, but of course, nothing.
[08:16:20.069 --> 08:16:27.093]  And, uh, you know, the footage from neighboring private security cameras was confiscated as well.
[08:16:27.153 --> 08:16:31.356]  So it'll be interesting to see what the footage is of.
[08:16:31.376 --> 08:16:32.937]  And it's not just for that reason.
[08:16:33.438 --> 08:16:35.059]  The caller has a very good point about that.
[08:16:35.339 --> 08:16:44.425]  But I mean, if all the footage you see on your major networks is from the same angle, and I'm not necessarily saying there's, you know, you know,
[08:16:45.490 --> 08:16:53.773]  Horrible evidence up in that cherry picker, but if it all the your angles are from the same angle I mean, how many times did you see the twin towers get hit from multiple angles?
[08:16:53.813 --> 08:17:00.056]  Yeah, if all the footage you see is from the one angle then you know There's definitely something up there and we appreciate your call.
[08:17:00.076 --> 08:17:04.858]  We'll move on to Joshua in California Hey, thanks for taking my call.
[08:17:04.918 --> 08:17:06.419]  I just thought it was interesting today.
[08:17:06.459 --> 08:17:14.362]  I uh I was wearing my errands at the grocery store, and they're only accepting cash and credit transactions under $75 I don't know if that's really big
[08:17:15.246 --> 08:17:17.630]  Point or not, but I just wanted to bring it up because I thought it was weird.
[08:17:17.670 --> 08:17:24.499]  And also, everyone needs to spread the word with all the information that you guys are giving, all the information that's been in other articles.
[08:17:24.540 --> 08:17:30.228]  And we need to tell everybody that we know, our friends, our family, and that everyone just really needs to get up off the bench and share this.
[08:17:30.268 --> 08:17:30.889]  Thanks for taking my call.
[08:17:31.311 --> 08:17:32.072]  Well, that's interesting.
[08:17:32.132 --> 08:17:33.052]  I wonder why they would do that.
[08:17:33.092 --> 08:17:34.954]  I can see why they would take cash.
[08:17:35.334 --> 08:17:41.899]  Maybe they put the $75 limit there because they don't have to check that and maybe there's some kind of a bottleneck in their electronic clearing.
[08:17:42.379 --> 08:17:45.302]  Yeah, where were you when you tried to make your purchase?
[08:17:46.613 --> 08:17:49.394]  I was at a Save Mart on Fulton in Sacramento.
[08:17:49.614 --> 08:17:50.414]  That's a grocery store?
[08:17:50.914 --> 08:17:51.614]  That's in California.
[08:17:51.634 --> 08:17:52.234]  Yeah, a grocery store.
[08:17:52.454 --> 08:17:52.854]  Okay.
[08:17:54.515 --> 08:18:04.277]  My main point, I just thought that was weird, my main point was that I just want to remind all the info warriors and everyone else that we need to tell our families and our friends of all the information that's coming out as soon as possible.
[08:18:04.837 --> 08:18:05.257]  Absolutely.
[08:18:05.977 --> 08:18:06.877]  Exactly, exactly.
[08:18:07.237 --> 08:18:08.118]  We appreciate your call.
[08:18:08.338 --> 08:18:08.838]  Thanks for calling.
[08:18:09.038 --> 08:18:12.018]  And I believe we have one more, Kevin in Rhode Island.
[08:18:13.339 --> 08:18:14.059]  Hey, how you doing guys?
[08:18:14.359 --> 08:18:14.619]  Doing good.
[08:18:16.867 --> 08:18:21.030]  First of all, prayers go out to the families of everybody that got affected by this.
[08:18:21.910 --> 08:18:25.953]  And second of all, you guys are doing an unbelievable job, everybody there at that organization.
[08:18:26.393 --> 08:18:30.375]  I did see a couple of local reports.
[08:18:30.795 --> 08:18:36.118]  One of the guys was from an organization in Rhode Island and I guess he was running the marathon.
[08:18:36.619 --> 08:18:44.003]  He actually finished probably a few minutes before the bombs went off and he got his family out of there and they went back a couple hours later.
[08:18:44.944 --> 08:18:48.767]  He said it was amazing how the national guy was all over the place.
[08:18:50.128 --> 08:18:51.750]  And was courting off the streets and everything.
[08:18:54.132 --> 08:18:56.293]  Obviously they were completely armed and everything.
[08:19:00.337 --> 08:19:07.523]  So he got across the finish line beforehand, so it didn't happen, it happened after some people had already finished, is that correct?
[08:19:09.324 --> 08:19:13.347]  And obviously he was concerned because he brought his children up there today, which obviously I'd be concerned too.
[08:19:14.808 --> 08:19:23.434]  Um, but I think it was just kind of interesting how he, like I said, the national guy was like, you know, the way he described it was like troops.
[08:19:25.195 --> 08:19:31.279]  It's maybe a two hour timeline from when he got back there, so they probably had enough time to get back there and set up some troops and get over there.
[08:19:32.740 --> 08:19:40.365]  They also had other media people reporting that resources were being brought in from other states, ATF, DHS of course.
[08:19:42.376 --> 08:19:47.140]  And, um, the one thing that I noticed that was really, uh, is actually, you know, it's the same thing happened with 9-11.
[08:19:47.840 --> 08:19:52.363]  As soon as something bad happens, it's always the civilians and the police working together, arm in arm.
[08:19:53.004 --> 08:19:54.045]  They're always helping each other.
[08:19:54.805 --> 08:19:58.828]  There's no, there's no, no difference between the badge and somebody just wearing a t-shirt.
[08:20:00.249 --> 08:20:08.495]  But then, you know, obviously as things go on, you know, the police force everybody out and then everything goes, you know, the routine as the way the police want it.
[08:20:09.236 --> 08:20:10.957]  My biggest thing is people shouldn't forget.
[08:20:11.860 --> 08:20:15.202]  That the police are here to help, and we need to wake them up as much as possible.
[08:20:15.502 --> 08:20:16.002]  Absolutely.
[08:20:16.423 --> 08:20:16.823]  Absolutely.
[08:20:16.903 --> 08:20:18.103]  And we need them to wake up.
[08:20:18.223 --> 08:20:20.705]  We absolutely have to have them awake.
[08:20:20.845 --> 08:20:24.427]  Thank you for reminding us of that, and we're going to be heading over to Alex now.
[08:20:24.727 --> 08:20:26.948]  Yes, Alex for the InfoWars Nightly News.
[08:20:28.029 --> 08:20:29.990]  InfoWars.com forward slash listen.
[08:20:43.348 --> 08:20:53.813]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.
[08:20:54.233 --> 08:20:59.576]  In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown Dallas.
[08:20:59.836 --> 08:21:05.339]  The first reports say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by the shooting.
[08:21:06.179 --> 08:21:07.440]  It is a big idea.
[08:21:07.520 --> 08:21:09.661]  A new world order.
[08:21:13.217 --> 08:21:15.860]  It was almost as if it were a planned implosion.
[08:21:15.880 --> 08:21:17.001]  It just pancaked.
[08:21:17.061 --> 08:21:24.089]  Either you were with us, or you were with the terrorists.
[08:21:37.543 --> 08:21:42.694]  I also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[08:21:47.364 --> 08:21:48.324]  Guns will be taken.
[08:21:48.364 --> 08:21:49.605]  No one will be able to be armed.
[08:21:49.725 --> 08:21:51.085]  We're going to take all of them.
[08:21:51.105 --> 08:21:55.887]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city.
[08:21:55.947 --> 08:21:57.207]  Global governance at last.
[08:21:57.307 --> 08:21:58.468]  Is it one world?
[08:21:58.488 --> 08:21:59.928]  The central bank is in charge.
[08:21:59.968 --> 08:22:03.649]  But aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[08:22:03.749 --> 08:22:07.530]  As for me, give me liberty or give me death!
[08:22:09.951 --> 08:22:11.111]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[08:22:22.830 --> 08:22:25.771]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[08:22:27.252 --> 08:22:34.714]  And I want to thank you for joining us this Patriots Day, 15th day of April, 2013.
[08:22:37.375 --> 08:22:47.299]  Obviously, when you have a global corporate occupational government run by foreign banks that has been caught staging terror attacks all over the world and that that's declassified,
[08:22:48.786 --> 08:23:04.089]  And when you read about Operation Gladio we're going to cover, where in Europe if a left-wing or right-wing group started getting control of a country through the electoral process, who was not popular with the Bilderberg Group, they would just stage terror attacks and blame it on them.
[08:23:05.989 --> 08:23:11.890]  So because we understand this history, we would be fools, we would be completely insane
[08:23:16.501 --> 08:23:20.204]  Not to investigate this as a false flag terror attack.
[08:23:20.664 --> 08:23:33.893]  So I want to cover some of the facts of what's currently happening with the Patriots Day Massacre, as they're now calling it, with the bombing of the Boston Marathon right there with the photo finish right at the end of the course.
[08:23:35.279 --> 08:23:36.381]  But you need to understand this.
[08:23:37.182 --> 08:23:48.839]  I have been warning you desperately, because it's all public in Globalist White Papers and different public publications, that the establishment
[08:23:50.089 --> 08:24:02.612]  Has been saying that there will be domestic terror attacks here in the United States, and that domestic groups are going to be carrying those out.
[08:24:03.212 --> 08:24:12.994]  And they put out the asinine headlines that the army plans to put down a Tea Party rebellion, that the Tea Party is going to work with Al Qaeda.
[08:24:13.014 --> 08:24:14.854]  Let me tell you who works with Al Qaeda.
[08:24:15.014 --> 08:24:18.098]  It's the Central Intelligence Agency and the offshore banks.
[08:24:18.138 --> 08:24:18.999]  They run Al-Qaeda.
[08:24:19.439 --> 08:24:20.561]  They created Al-Qaeda.
[08:24:20.901 --> 08:24:25.626]  They use Al-Qaeda to menace the West into submission.
[08:24:27.028 --> 08:24:49.058]  And when you look at the level and the magnitude of the dramas and the sitcoms and all of the other productions that are out there where the right-wingers are going to stage the terror attack, the right-wingers are going to carry out all these different events,
[08:24:50.158 --> 08:24:57.423]  For someone who is conscious and awake, it is as plain as the nose on your face.
[08:25:00.720 --> 08:25:13.004]  As a society, and guys, I'm getting a feed into my ear, a humming feed, so they got a channel open, probably from the other side into my ear, that's why I had to take the piece out, little hint on that, thank you.
[08:25:13.744 --> 08:25:20.206]  I also hope that you understand that when you watch so-called mainstream globalist media,
[08:25:22.358 --> 08:25:30.003]  That they have reporters for a couple minutes, reading off teleprompters, who've rehearsed it for hours, who come on to look compelling and real.
[08:25:30.644 --> 08:25:32.465]  Reading what someone else told them to say.
[08:25:33.146 --> 08:25:39.830]  When you see me up here, or my crew, this is teleprompter-free, real brain, real analysis, this is real.
[08:25:40.431 --> 08:25:47.216]  And I hope that all the viewers out there understand how special InfoWars.com is, because we're fighting to even keep it up and running.
[08:25:47.976 --> 08:25:56.998]  I hope you realize that there is no other alternative media doing real live news, real analysis, from a real historical perspective.
[08:25:57.558 --> 08:26:00.019]  It's all left-wing controlled or right-wing controlled.
[08:26:00.799 --> 08:26:02.820]  There is no real media out there.
[08:26:02.980 --> 08:26:11.482]  And I've got a skeleton crew out there that is probably into hour number 14 today, doing the regular radio show, the TV show, all of it.
[08:26:11.502 --> 08:26:13.882]  And I'm not up here complaining about that.
[08:26:14.422 --> 08:26:16.123]  I want you to realize that
[08:26:17.213 --> 08:26:18.335]  We are the resistance.
[08:26:19.176 --> 08:26:26.945]  And yes, in FallWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, everything we're doing is having more and more...
[08:26:29.187 --> 08:26:32.130]  of an effect on so many fronts.
[08:26:32.811 --> 08:26:45.903]  And so the good news is when the White House comes out and demonizes the Drudge Report, or comes out and has their surrogates attack Infowars.com and myself, their surrogates like Media Matters and others openly run by the White House, it shows that we're in the fight.
[08:26:46.103 --> 08:26:52.610]  They wouldn't be attacking us if we weren't on to what was really happening.
[08:26:54.335 --> 08:26:57.920]  Now, let me just get this out in the open for everybody.
[08:26:57.960 --> 08:27:04.029]  The New York Post is reporting 12 dead, nearly 50 injured after two explosions rock Boston Marathon.
[08:27:04.550 --> 08:27:06.833]  Suspect identified and being guarded at hospital.
[08:27:07.234 --> 08:27:09.116]  And they're saying a Saudi Arabian.
[08:27:10.353 --> 08:27:13.354]  But separately, we have clips we're going to play in a moment of CNN.
[08:27:13.374 --> 08:27:18.656]  I mean, it's ad nauseum and Fox and MSNBC saying, could it be right wingers?
[08:27:18.756 --> 08:27:19.776]  It's Patriot Day.
[08:27:20.757 --> 08:27:23.598]  You know, they had other Patriot events in the area.
[08:27:23.958 --> 08:27:25.919]  Could this be carried out by them?
[08:27:27.865 --> 08:27:34.168]  I went on the radio today, two hours, well really three hours before this happened, at 11 a.m.
[08:27:34.208 --> 08:27:45.313]  Central, 12 noon Eastern, and I said all the hype and media buildup I see clearly is pointing towards the establishment firing the first shot but blaming it on us.
[08:27:46.584 --> 08:27:52.029]  Because whoever fires the shot heard around the world first has a good chance of losing because they're in the wrong.
[08:27:52.510 --> 08:28:05.822]  So I said the establishment will fire the first shot, but blame it on us, just like Lexington and Concord, which actually happened again in and around Boston 200-something years ago today.
[08:28:06.222 --> 08:28:07.424]  Started today through the 19th.
[08:28:07.444 --> 08:28:09.966]  There were events and skirmishes.
[08:28:12.352 --> 08:28:21.077]  You have to understand, if the globalists can demonize liberals, conservatives, libertarians, whatever the case is, whoever's opposing them.
[08:28:22.202 --> 08:28:27.087]  By setting off a bombing, a mass shooting, and then collectively blaming a group, they will do it.
[08:28:27.467 --> 08:28:30.470]  So you have to understand, it's not gun owners' fault Sandy Hook happened.
[08:28:30.790 --> 08:28:32.612]  They collectively try to tell us that's our fault.
[08:28:33.332 --> 08:28:34.293]  That's a fraud on its face.
[08:28:35.514 --> 08:28:42.080]  The proliferation of gun ownership in the last 20 years, we've shown the FBI numbers at nauseam, 49% drop in violent crime.
[08:28:43.161 --> 08:28:51.563]  But they can take individual events and hype them up where you feel like it's just happened to you, using your basic human empathy.
[08:28:51.803 --> 08:28:53.143]  Because they know you're a good person.
[08:28:53.503 --> 08:29:00.904]  And they sit there like psychopathic, sociopathic technocrats, punching those buttons that make you a human.
[08:29:01.464 --> 08:29:02.665]  That make you a good person.
[08:29:04.725 --> 08:29:09.386]  And so first, before I get into all this news, I want to
[08:29:11.840 --> 08:29:22.874]  Play a clip off a YouTube video we shot about four hours ago, where CNN was already, within a few hours of this event happening, saying, could it be right-wing extremists?
[08:29:24.716 --> 08:29:34.346]  And even though the narrative has now come out that it could be a Saudi Arabian Al-Qaeda group, they're still on MSNBC as we speak, right before I went live, saying it's probably right-wingers.
[08:29:34.867 --> 08:29:42.515]  Now, I said first, the minute it happened with Richard Belzer, the actor and writer on, I said, watch, they'll try to blame it on libertarians, conservatives.
[08:29:42.815 --> 08:29:43.395]  And he agreed.
[08:29:44.690 --> 08:30:00.442]  Now, I had everybody from Glenn Beck to Salon, to Media Matters, to MediaLite, to BBC come out and attack us tonight and say how dare Alex Jones say the government could be involved.
[08:30:01.963 --> 08:30:03.224]  Now, Glenn Beck went further.
[08:30:03.284 --> 08:30:08.788]  He said, I said the government did it, when what I said was they have done it over and over again.
[08:30:09.169 --> 08:30:10.370]  It's been declassified.
[08:30:11.875 --> 08:30:14.436]  And so we have to look at them as the prime suspects.
[08:30:15.196 --> 08:30:26.019]  And my point is, they do not want us, as a culture, to even think that, hey, who really stands to gain?
[08:30:26.339 --> 08:30:27.539]  Who gets to sell a police state?
[08:30:27.559 --> 08:30:28.499]  Who gets to take liberties?
[08:30:28.759 --> 08:30:32.100]  Who gets billions every month in no-bid weapons contracts?
[08:30:32.460 --> 08:30:35.761]  Who's been caught doing this before?
[08:30:38.058 --> 08:30:49.812]  So let's go to that first clip from my little YouTube report I did, where a few hours after, and a few hours after I said they'll probably blame it on us, CNN was already trying to do it.
[08:30:49.933 --> 08:30:51.835]  So, am I a good guy for being right?
[08:30:51.895 --> 08:30:52.255]  No, no, no.
[08:30:52.916 --> 08:30:54.158]  According to Beck, I'm a bad guy.
[08:30:54.178 --> 08:30:54.839]  Let's go to that clip.
[08:30:56.673 --> 08:30:59.935]  And Peter, what are you waiting to hear about in these coming hours?
[08:31:00.636 --> 08:31:08.681]  I think the actual, the constituency inside the bomb is going to make a big difference about how we identify the person who did this, or the persons who did this.
[08:31:08.881 --> 08:31:11.583]  Because if it's hydrogen peroxide, that points to al-Qaeda.
[08:31:11.603 --> 08:31:15.646]  If it's something else, it could be a different, it could be a right-wing extremist group, or some other group.
[08:31:15.926 --> 08:31:18.908]  I now turn it over to Wolf Blitzer in the Situation Room for the latest on it.
[08:31:20.329 --> 08:31:21.090]  Alright, folks.
[08:31:22.654 --> 08:31:31.298]  I went on the radio today, hours before this happened, it's on record, the 15th of April, and I said I can see all the scripting with the TV shows, the movies, where it's the right way.
[08:31:34.339 --> 08:31:41.102]  And again, I'm just marveling here tonight, watching my crew, who have their families at home, and I'm not kissing their butt, because they're even asking for it.
[08:31:41.122 --> 08:31:42.423]  I just want to say I appreciate the crew.
[08:31:43.043 --> 08:31:45.324]  And I appreciate you, the listeners and viewers out there.
[08:31:45.884 --> 08:31:51.047]  Because, you know, my dad was here picking up my son tonight, because he was here with me all day, to take him home to my wife.
[08:31:51.807 --> 08:32:00.554]  I just looked at my dad and my son walking away, the generation before me, the generation after me, thinking about how they're just little souls like myself who just want a future.
[08:32:01.315 --> 08:32:09.482]  And, you know, it's a fact, it's declassified, that our government created al-Qaeda and is running them in Libya and Syria and gave them heat-seeking missiles.
[08:32:10.062 --> 08:32:19.130]  And how dare Salon, Media Matters, BBC, Mediaite, and Glenn Beck, and he was the worst,
[08:32:20.259 --> 08:32:21.380]  Even though I've done all the branch.
[08:32:22.341 --> 08:32:25.784]  To say how dare unpatriotic Alex Jones say the government did it.
[08:32:26.344 --> 08:32:32.730]  I said criminal global mafias are funding terrorists and mentally ill people.
[08:32:32.750 --> 08:32:34.672]  I'm going to show the documents and articles on that.
[08:32:35.312 --> 08:32:39.496]  And that who stands to gain if they call for taking our liberties because of this.
[08:32:40.316 --> 08:32:41.397]  You know it's staged.
[08:32:41.497 --> 08:32:43.719]  I've been saying soft target attacks are coming.
[08:32:44.940 --> 08:32:51.385]  Because they're teaching police, veterans will bomb every police department in America and public events with IEDs.
[08:32:52.005 --> 08:32:52.766]  With no proof!
[08:32:53.286 --> 08:32:56.849]  And training and saying Christians and gun owners are not the threat.
[08:32:56.869 --> 08:33:02.092]  You know, Al-Qaeda is not the threat, the Christians and gun owners are.
[08:33:02.112 --> 08:33:04.094]  I had a Freudian slip, we are not the threat.
[08:33:04.794 --> 08:33:06.596]  Al-Qaeda, the globalist control system is.
[08:33:07.651 --> 08:33:14.435]  And again, statistically, hundreds of thousands die from bad drug interactions and flesh-eating bacteria a year in the U.S.
[08:33:14.475 --> 08:33:14.755]  alone.
[08:33:14.855 --> 08:33:16.576]  Why is it so scary?
[08:33:16.596 --> 08:33:24.100]  Well, they emotionalize it, they show a guy with his leg blown off, and they create this fear, hey, we better have army at every...
[08:33:24.820 --> 08:33:25.361]  Stoplight.
[08:33:25.381 --> 08:33:29.884]  We better have checkpoints and body scanners to go to any store because the terrorist hit.
[08:33:30.304 --> 08:33:33.867]  This is how an oligarchy takes control of a society.
[08:33:34.467 --> 08:33:48.718]  This has been declassified that our government, NATO, staged more than 200 terror attacks from the 1960s to 1981 in Europe to blame their political enemies and they just hope you don't go look it up.
[08:33:48.778 --> 08:33:48.938]  Now,
[08:33:51.894 --> 08:33:55.516]  Let's go over first, before I get into the bombing itself.
[08:33:58.418 --> 08:34:09.364]  And again, there's maybe a 5% chance out of 100 that this could be real Muslim terrorists, or I guess there could be some domestic group freaked out that would go stage this.
[08:34:10.204 --> 08:34:14.927]  To be clear, I've never seen an Easter Bunny, but some say it's real.
[08:34:16.564 --> 08:34:18.265]  To be clear, I've never seen Santa Claus.
[08:34:18.366 --> 08:34:19.106]  Some say it's real.
[08:34:19.446 --> 08:34:20.527]  Never seen a unicorn.
[08:34:20.808 --> 08:34:21.508]  Some say it's real.
[08:34:22.269 --> 08:34:23.890]  Now, I don't think it exists, but it may.
[08:34:25.191 --> 08:34:26.593]  Same thing with domestic terror groups.
[08:34:26.633 --> 08:34:31.777]  I mean, I've interviewed the cops and the people that saw the feds plant the bombs on Oklahoma City.
[08:34:32.117 --> 08:34:33.699]  You saw them stage Fast and Furious.
[08:34:33.879 --> 08:34:35.260]  Folks, they staged Aurora.
[08:34:35.600 --> 08:34:36.701]  They staged Sandy Hook.
[08:34:36.721 --> 08:34:38.102]  The evidence is just overwhelming.
[08:34:38.443 --> 08:34:40.344]  And that's why I'm so desperate and freaked out.
[08:34:41.145 --> 08:34:41.906]  This is not fun.
[08:34:43.015 --> 08:34:46.926]  You know, getting up here telling you this, I, I, I... Somebody's gotta tell you the truth.
[08:34:47.046 --> 08:34:48.750]  Somebody's gotta stand against these people.
[08:34:49.332 --> 08:34:50.254]  Somebody's gotta do it.
[08:34:51.217 --> 08:34:51.337]  And...
[08:35:02.367 --> 08:35:11.834]  I just hope everybody that is watching out there that serves the system who thinks they're going to get away with all this, I hope you understand that you're not going to get away with this.
[08:35:12.454 --> 08:35:15.877]  You get rid of our checks and balances, our protections, you're going to lose yours as well.
[08:35:17.338 --> 08:35:22.962]  And you want to throw your children out in the cold, you think you're cold-blooded, you think you're a winner, doing stuff like this you're not.
[08:35:24.164 --> 08:35:25.965]  Now, that said, they were running drills.
[08:35:26.005 --> 08:35:27.125]  I haven't even gotten to that yet.
[08:35:27.505 --> 08:35:33.728]  They were running drills at the exact time it happened with loudspeakers saying, don't worry, never mind, it's only a drill.
[08:35:35.049 --> 08:35:41.091]  It's one thing to have bomb dogs out, you know, to add to the atmosphere of the police state and, hey, you need the government.
[08:35:41.611 --> 08:35:47.914]  But it's another thing to have them announcing, hey, this is just a drill, don't worry, and then right where the dogs are, ten minutes later, bombs go off.
[08:35:49.312 --> 08:35:54.934]  So we're going to get into all of that, but I think it's important to always start with history, because those that don't know history are doomed to repeat it.
[08:35:55.334 --> 08:36:00.955]  And again, we're live at 735 Central here on InfoWars Nightly News for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[08:36:01.756 --> 08:36:08.438]  And if you are watching, InfoWars.com forward slash listen has the free video streams right there for everybody.
[08:36:08.478 --> 08:36:12.619]  The articles are up on InfoWars.com, and they want to hour one
[08:36:13.579 --> 08:36:15.181]  Have their official story out.
[08:36:15.261 --> 08:36:17.383]  We know who the prime suspects are.
[08:36:17.744 --> 08:36:20.627]  We know the history of this type of stuff.
[08:36:21.387 --> 08:36:23.309]  And we understand what's happening.
[08:36:25.412 --> 08:36:27.013]  And so we're here risking our lives.
[08:36:27.174 --> 08:36:28.275]  Myself, number one.
[08:36:29.932 --> 08:36:39.759]  Because there is no future if we let a criminal oligarchy continue to fund terror attacks or allow terror attacks to take place so they can pose as saviors and take our rights.
[08:36:39.799 --> 08:36:49.085]  But document Cam, please, I want to, before I get into the latest news, I want to show you, you know, I just played that clip of them saying right-wing extremist.
[08:36:50.930 --> 08:36:53.031]  Then again, they may end up blaming it on Iran, too.
[08:36:53.051 --> 08:36:54.552]  They're getting ready to hit Iran, as you know.
[08:36:54.572 --> 08:36:56.113]  And I'm not defending Iran.
[08:36:56.133 --> 08:36:56.913]  I don't live in Iran.
[08:36:56.953 --> 08:36:58.754]  But, I mean, it's on record.
[08:36:58.794 --> 08:37:00.335]  False flags have been done against Iran.
[08:37:00.475 --> 08:37:07.678]  Our government overthrew the Iranian government by staging terror attacks in Operation Ajax in 1953 that they blamed on the government.
[08:37:07.718 --> 08:37:12.300]  They attacked Muslim Mosque and said that the kind of quasi-secular leader, Mohammad Mosaddegh, had done it.
[08:37:12.901 --> 08:37:14.802]  Kermit Roosevelt, CIA, MI6.
[08:37:15.202 --> 08:37:18.323]  See, this is all on record, but they just want to say conspiracy theory.
[08:37:18.583 --> 08:37:19.124]  Let's go to this.
[08:37:20.254 --> 08:37:23.677]  Alex Jones, Boston explosion of government conspiracy.
[08:37:24.799 --> 08:37:35.129]  The fringe see a false flag that can be blamed on the Tea Party and expand TSA's reach when they're already, they got troops out at kite festivals here in Austin now for Al Qaeda.
[08:37:36.104 --> 08:37:36.625]  Here's another one.
[08:37:37.566 --> 08:37:42.331]  Alex Jones declares Boston a false flag operation, FBI behind every domestic terror plot.
[08:37:42.651 --> 08:37:44.473]  I'm going to show you the New York Times saying that.
[08:37:45.494 --> 08:37:52.962]  The last hundred big plots they've had the last decade were all mentally ill people or purely made-up events, okay?
[08:37:54.486 --> 08:37:56.307]  Um, here's the blaze.
[08:37:56.847 --> 08:38:03.068]  With absolutely no evidence, even though we've got history, you know, like if somebody's robbed a bank ten times, and then the same M.O.
[08:38:03.088 --> 08:38:04.349]  matches, they're a prime suspect.
[08:38:04.609 --> 08:38:10.730]  With no evidence, Alex Jones calls Boston Marathon Explosions a false flag operation conducted by government.
[08:38:10.770 --> 08:38:10.970]  No.
[08:38:11.730 --> 08:38:17.612]  My tweet that Watson or whoever put it out with a typo in it said, don't that the FBI
[08:38:19.654 --> 08:38:23.335]  Don't doubt, I guess, has been behind virtually every domestic terror plot in U.S.
[08:38:23.776 --> 08:38:25.116]  history, the New York Times reported.
[08:38:25.496 --> 08:38:26.977]  And then a link to the New York Times.
[08:38:27.597 --> 08:38:29.018]  So there's all this implication.
[08:38:29.378 --> 08:38:32.339]  Army training manual lists evangelical Catholics as extremists.
[08:38:34.099 --> 08:38:35.840]  Big cis coordinating gun confiscations.
[08:38:37.281 --> 08:38:38.261]  Now look at this.
[08:38:38.281 --> 08:38:43.363]  CNN national security analyst warns of right-wing extremists behind Boston bombings.
[08:38:44.892 --> 08:38:47.833]  That's Peter Bergen, big insider globalist.
[08:38:47.953 --> 08:38:51.834]  So there they are, saying exactly what I said they would say.
[08:38:51.854 --> 08:38:54.095]  And am I good for being right?
[08:38:54.495 --> 08:38:56.936]  No, I'm a piece of crap, according to all these White House groups.
[08:38:57.656 --> 08:39:01.957]  And Glenn Beck, who the media promotes, the establishment White House-run media.
[08:39:02.277 --> 08:39:03.578]  They promote him by demonizing him.
[08:39:04.218 --> 08:39:07.020]  Growing threat of right-wing extremism and violence.
[08:39:07.040 --> 08:39:08.221]  I mean, just constant.
[08:39:08.241 --> 08:39:09.141]  They're going to attack.
[08:39:09.541 --> 08:39:10.542]  There's nothing you can do.
[08:39:11.002 --> 08:39:13.264]  On and on and on.
[08:39:13.324 --> 08:39:14.544]  Now, let me show you this.
[08:39:14.584 --> 08:39:18.647]  This is the New York Times, April 2012, a year ago.
[08:39:19.247 --> 08:39:21.309]  Terrorist plots hatched by the FBI.
[08:39:21.669 --> 08:39:27.392]  And it goes on to say they manufactured all the recent terror attacks with mentally ill patsies.
[08:39:27.472 --> 08:39:29.414]  Okay, that's what we were linking to.
[08:39:30.754 --> 08:39:31.975]  That's what we were covering.
[08:39:32.595 --> 08:39:33.955]  That's what we were talking about.
[08:39:36.496 --> 08:39:36.837]  Okay?
[08:39:37.337 --> 08:39:41.539]  Now, Glenn Beck acts like, with no evidence, I'm saying this.
[08:39:41.939 --> 08:39:42.619]  You want evidence?
[08:39:43.419 --> 08:39:52.023]  Again, they don't want you to ever think that Hitler could have staged terror attacks on his own military bases to launch World War II and Operation Goliwitz under Operation Himmler.
[08:39:52.243 --> 08:39:53.844]  That's declassified Nuremberg trials.
[08:39:54.804 --> 08:39:56.525]  They attacked their own bases and blamed it on the Poles.
[08:39:56.765 --> 08:40:02.849]  They don't want you to know Vietnam was launched with a staged Gulf of Tonkin, now declassified as staged by our government, attacks on our own ships.
[08:40:03.129 --> 08:40:06.331]  They don't want you to know about Ajax, Northwoods, Gladio.
[08:40:06.751 --> 08:40:06.931]  No.
[08:40:07.111 --> 08:40:12.294]  They just want to say, there's Alex Jones, there's the bad man, because I don't like a bunch of foreign banks
[08:40:12.634 --> 08:40:20.303]  Running our intelligence agencies, staging terror attacks so they can create a monopoly society and overthrow our free republic and our free market.
[08:40:20.643 --> 08:40:26.330]  I don't like it when they say the new threat is gun owning, returning veterans and conservatives and libertarians.
[08:40:26.610 --> 08:40:27.511]  Total creepville!
[08:40:28.112 --> 08:40:37.159]  And the state police come out last week in Oklahoma and in Colorado and say, first Colorado, and say, we've been told prepare to mass arrest Christians and take their guns.
[08:40:37.460 --> 08:40:39.521]  I mean, this is body snatcher level stuff.
[08:40:39.842 --> 08:40:46.767]  This is obviously the bad guys in control in a soft coup trying to roll out a purge of the American people.
[08:40:47.328 --> 08:40:48.248]  This isn't a game.
[08:40:48.849 --> 08:40:49.810]  Let's go to this article.
[08:40:52.592 --> 08:40:53.853]  Yeah, UM Coach bombs.
[08:40:53.873 --> 08:40:54.694]  Yeah, put that back up.
[08:40:56.021 --> 08:41:01.068]  Bomb-sniffing dogs were at start-finish lines at drill, and people spin that and go, well, there's always dogs.
[08:41:01.088 --> 08:41:01.488]  No, no, no, no.
[08:41:01.849 --> 08:41:05.153]  The local news article says they were on loudspeaker saying it's only a drill.
[08:41:05.414 --> 08:41:06.996]  We're going to get to that after we cover this.
[08:41:07.516 --> 08:41:08.538]  We're going to get to that in a moment.
[08:41:08.578 --> 08:41:10.020]  Let's go back to this article right here.
[08:41:11.161 --> 08:41:12.182]  This is just history of it.
[08:41:12.222 --> 08:41:13.163]  This is just last week.
[08:41:13.783 --> 08:41:16.726]  Italian Supreme Court President blames Bilderberg for terror attack.
[08:41:17.126 --> 08:41:20.389]  Document says secretive group was involved in strategy of tension.
[08:41:20.649 --> 08:41:36.822]  They had their former president, their former CIA director, their former prime minister come out and say, and they've released a lot of this in the news, that Bilderberg, this private mafia, this banker mafia, stages terror attacks in Italy and Europe every time we try to get our sovereignty back.
[08:41:38.035 --> 08:41:39.876]  They do it and blame their political enemies.
[08:41:40.697 --> 08:41:40.977]  Okay?
[08:41:41.638 --> 08:41:42.198]  Here's another one.
[08:41:42.518 --> 08:41:44.500]  President Armen Karzai thinks the U.S.
[08:41:44.540 --> 08:41:48.983]  could be behind the latest Taliban bombings as a pretext to stay in the country.
[08:41:49.303 --> 08:41:50.504]  He goes on to say the U.S.
[08:41:50.544 --> 08:41:51.325]  created Al-Qaeda.
[08:41:51.545 --> 08:41:52.686]  Well, that's just a known fact.
[08:41:53.246 --> 08:41:55.668]  There's Operation Gladio and the NATO option.
[08:41:55.708 --> 08:41:57.949]  Hundreds of staged bombings all over Europe.
[08:41:58.530 --> 08:41:58.850]  Okay?
[08:41:59.050 --> 08:42:00.771]  Look it up to blame their political enemies.
[08:42:01.231 --> 08:42:01.472]  U.S.
[08:42:01.552 --> 08:42:06.275]  accused of colluding with Taliban in Afghanistan as President Karzai hijacks Hegel visit.
[08:42:06.895 --> 08:42:08.856]  Afghanistan Karzai blasts U.S.
[08:42:09.297 --> 08:42:10.237]  barring Hegel visit.
[08:42:10.297 --> 08:42:10.658]  Reuters.
[08:42:10.978 --> 08:42:12.939]  And it goes on to say the U.S.
[08:42:12.979 --> 08:42:15.221]  staged the events with their Al Qaeda forces.
[08:42:15.861 --> 08:42:22.726]  The bombs set off yesterday in the name of the Taliban were in the service of Americans to keep foreigners longer in Afghanistan, of course.
[08:42:23.546 --> 08:42:24.867]  Trillions every few years.
[08:42:25.407 --> 08:42:31.369]  And it's not the US, it's global crime syndicates in control of our country.
[08:42:31.749 --> 08:42:34.090]  Now, let's go on to this next stack of news.
[08:42:34.550 --> 08:42:37.691]  Here's what Marcos was just showing you on screen.
[08:42:39.984 --> 08:42:40.264]  U.M.
[08:42:40.304 --> 08:42:42.825]  coach, bomb-sniffing dogs were at start and finish lines.
[08:42:42.845 --> 08:42:46.186]  People say, well that's what happens now in the security theater.
[08:42:46.666 --> 08:42:47.246]  No, no, no.
[08:42:47.826 --> 08:42:54.308]  They kept making announcements on the loudspeaker that it was just a drill, just like 9-11, just like Aurora.
[08:42:54.708 --> 08:42:56.949]  And there was nothing to worry about, he said.
[08:42:57.967 --> 08:43:02.432]  And then now, in fact, I gave this to David when they were on, I forgot to bring it back over here.
[08:43:02.452 --> 08:43:03.993]  I need to get it from him.
[08:43:04.113 --> 08:43:09.539]  Local news is reporting that there were people there the day before saying, don't be here, you're going to get bombed.
[08:43:09.759 --> 08:43:10.860]  Because this stuff gets leaked.
[08:43:11.281 --> 08:43:12.202]  Just like 9-11.
[08:43:12.522 --> 08:43:16.907]  Local news is reporting that people were going, don't sign up for this, they're going to bomb you.
[08:43:17.407 --> 08:43:18.608]  That's in local news.
[08:43:19.469 --> 08:43:19.850]  And again,
[08:43:21.343 --> 08:43:25.385]  If they were running a drill and they weren't staging it, they would normally say, oh, we were there.
[08:43:25.485 --> 08:43:26.685]  Stop trying to stop it.
[08:43:26.745 --> 08:43:27.306]  What heroes.
[08:43:27.666 --> 08:43:29.847]  They had troops there digging people out of the wreckage.
[08:43:30.407 --> 08:43:32.248]  You know, all of this is a giant photo op.
[08:43:33.288 --> 08:43:33.929]  And it gets worse.
[08:43:34.469 --> 08:43:49.275]  One of the biggest pieces of news is Rob Due has had public arguments in front of me on the phone and via text messages with his wife's brother, who is in domestic defense intelligence operations.
[08:43:49.315 --> 08:43:50.056]  We'll just leave it at that.
[08:43:51.056 --> 08:43:52.057]  And, I mean, it's such a huge thing.
[08:43:52.117 --> 08:43:54.138]  It's like having somebody that works at Walmart in your family.
[08:43:54.438 --> 08:43:57.000]  I mean, it's just millions of people involved in this spy network.
[08:43:57.860 --> 08:44:01.363]  And, you know, he sends him, like, here's the photo of Bin Laden.
[08:44:01.423 --> 08:44:02.103]  See, it's real.
[08:44:02.463 --> 08:44:04.505]  And it's the fake Bin Laden put out by the Daily Mail.
[08:44:05.065 --> 08:44:07.106]  And we send him back the message going, no, that's the fake one.
[08:44:07.126 --> 08:44:08.127]  No, I'm not going to look at it.
[08:44:08.467 --> 08:44:09.327]  I saw something else.
[08:44:09.528 --> 08:44:11.249]  Because they give them the fake ones as well.
[08:44:11.589 --> 08:44:14.551]  People in intelligence are even more brainwashed than those without it.
[08:44:15.876 --> 08:44:20.179]  He was running in the army team, the official army team, brought in by an army truck.
[08:44:20.459 --> 08:44:22.080]  He's a marathon champion.
[08:44:22.100 --> 08:44:25.442]  I mean, Dew's been with him on vacation when he runs.
[08:44:25.882 --> 08:44:27.223]  Gets up at, you know, 3 a.m.
[08:44:27.263 --> 08:44:28.924]  and runs 20 miles before breakfast.
[08:44:30.645 --> 08:44:35.949]  They come to the line a few minutes before the bombing and they say, get out of line, you're sick, you're going to the hospital.
[08:44:36.229 --> 08:44:36.569]  And he goes, what?
[08:44:36.629 --> 08:44:37.610]  And they go, that's an order.
[08:44:37.870 --> 08:44:39.071]  And they take him out of the line.
[08:44:40.307 --> 08:44:41.928]  I guess, I guess friends took care of him, huh?
[08:44:42.589 --> 08:44:45.431]  I mean, this is just off the chart, and Dew has already talked about it.
[08:44:45.912 --> 08:44:51.817]  And Dew, you were in a band with Joe Stack that flew his plane into the World Trade, I mean, into the IRS building.
[08:44:51.857 --> 08:44:52.497]  I mean, this is crazy.
[08:44:52.517 --> 08:44:53.418]  You want to come over here and talk?
[08:44:53.999 --> 08:44:57.161]  Hey, have you finally gotten more intel on what happened with your brother-in-law?
[08:44:57.262 --> 08:44:57.642]  I have not.
[08:44:57.662 --> 08:44:58.743]  They haven't heard from him yet.
[08:44:58.863 --> 08:45:03.887]  Apparently, he's at the hospital, and his wife is on his way to meet up with him.
[08:45:04.127 --> 08:45:05.649]  And that's the last that I've heard.
[08:45:07.836 --> 08:45:12.559]  So, well, with the Joe Stack thing, it was my neighbor's band and I would go sit in.
[08:45:13.420 --> 08:45:15.662]  But, yeah, I knew Joe Stack, which is pretty weird.
[08:45:15.742 --> 08:45:17.383]  Oh, we released the video, yeah, of you playing with him.
[08:45:17.503 --> 08:45:17.723]  Yeah.
[08:45:17.743 --> 08:45:22.847]  But, I mean, have I not every day been saying, and privately this morning I was freaking out, that they're going to do something.
[08:45:22.927 --> 08:45:23.227]  Oh, yeah.
[08:45:23.367 --> 08:45:24.228]  The crew's like, how the hell?
[08:45:24.588 --> 08:45:25.449]  I could see it all.
[08:45:25.489 --> 08:45:26.129]  I could feel it.
[08:45:26.289 --> 08:45:26.470]  Yeah.
[08:45:26.570 --> 08:45:27.931]  Because it's not just these dead people.
[08:45:27.951 --> 08:45:30.933]  I can tell you're stressed, too, because your voice is definitely, like, cracking more.
[08:45:31.073 --> 08:45:32.174]  I mean, you're definitely...
[08:45:32.754 --> 08:45:34.636]  This is definitely weighing on you right now.
[08:45:35.036 --> 08:45:35.377]  I can tell.
[08:45:35.397 --> 08:45:36.698]  Well, because they're going to do it all over.
[08:45:37.419 --> 08:45:41.263]  If this beta test works, they're going to go full bore, declare us all terrorists.
[08:45:41.363 --> 08:45:42.784]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[08:45:43.205 --> 08:45:45.427]  It's the authoritarian takeover of America, man.
[08:45:45.487 --> 08:45:45.747]  Oh, yeah.
[08:45:46.067 --> 08:45:46.228]  Yeah.
[08:45:46.548 --> 08:45:48.870]  Because they can't have us free when they bring in the world government.
[08:45:49.131 --> 08:45:49.311]  Right.
[08:45:50.352 --> 08:45:51.133]  I mean, what do you think?
[08:45:51.593 --> 08:45:52.214]  What are your points?
[08:45:52.234 --> 08:45:53.255]  I'm going to get into this other news.
[08:45:53.905 --> 08:46:04.014]  I think the biggest thing is, well this is interesting too, the Boston Runners were warned, that coach just getting on there and saying, this other article, bomb sniffing dogs were there.
[08:46:04.215 --> 08:46:05.256]  But that's not even the issue.
[08:46:06.141 --> 08:46:09.042]  They kept making announcements on the loudspeaker that it was just a drill.
[08:46:09.242 --> 08:46:10.283]  The Madrid bombing.
[08:46:10.303 --> 08:46:11.803]  7-7 in London.
[08:46:11.903 --> 08:46:12.824]  Every event, Rob.
[08:46:13.484 --> 08:46:13.864]  Every event.
[08:46:13.884 --> 08:46:15.024]  There's always a drill.
[08:46:15.425 --> 08:46:16.865]  Because people say, why does that matter?
[08:46:17.285 --> 08:46:20.526]  Because they cover the funding of the drill and it's compartmentalized.
[08:46:20.747 --> 08:46:22.567]  If people catch them, they say it's a drill.
[08:46:22.827 --> 08:46:23.828]  And then they get some guy...
[08:46:24.668 --> 08:46:28.651]  Drug him up, or they plant him like the FBI's been caught doing, and we showed that article too.
[08:46:28.671 --> 08:46:29.672]  Well, look at this coming out.
[08:46:29.752 --> 08:46:37.919]  Boston runners were warned, and this is being reported in the local news, that people are walking around the day before saying, you're gonna die if you're part of this.
[08:46:39.104 --> 08:46:40.024]  Because this stuff leaks.
[08:46:40.425 --> 08:46:44.086]  People always say, well, if something like this happened, it would come out, people would speak.
[08:46:44.406 --> 08:46:45.267]  They always do!
[08:46:45.287 --> 08:46:46.767]  Yeah, it just gets buried.
[08:46:47.247 --> 08:46:48.748]  It always gets buried in the back of the news.
[08:46:48.808 --> 08:46:51.649]  And again, we now have TSA checkpoints where we live.
[08:46:52.089 --> 08:46:54.030]  They now have Army at public events.
[08:46:54.050 --> 08:46:55.471]  Well, this is a big excuse to do this.
[08:46:55.751 --> 08:46:58.673]  I mean, that's the, oh, there's bombings at the Boston Marathon.
[08:46:58.713 --> 08:47:03.075]  They want to control travel because they're going to do such horrible stuff, taking the pension funds and stuff.
[08:47:03.476 --> 08:47:12.261]  They're going to want to keep people on watch lists out of the central city because they know people are going to be so mad when your neighbor disappears, your kid disappears, that you're going to go on a vendetta against government.
[08:47:12.481 --> 08:47:12.641]  Right.
[08:47:12.781 --> 08:47:15.563]  And they're already telling the bureaucrats, you're going to be alright, we're going to take care of you.
[08:47:15.823 --> 08:47:17.023]  I've talked to police all over the country.
[08:47:17.043 --> 08:47:18.684]  You know, where they have the tanks in East St.
[08:47:18.724 --> 08:47:19.785]  Louis protecting the city council?
[08:47:19.805 --> 08:47:20.005]  Oh yeah.
[08:47:20.405 --> 08:47:22.706]  They've told them, don't worry, during this time we'll protect you.
[08:47:22.726 --> 08:47:22.906]  Right.
[08:47:23.387 --> 08:47:25.488]  So, I mean, this is a takeover.
[08:47:25.528 --> 08:47:28.169]  This is Vichy France being taken over by the Nazis.
[08:47:28.189 --> 08:47:28.829]  And it's conditioning.
[08:47:28.849 --> 08:47:31.491]  Because the people that they interviewed in St.
[08:47:31.531 --> 08:47:33.712]  Louis were saying, I feel safer that they're around.
[08:47:33.752 --> 08:47:34.372]  I feel safer.
[08:47:34.392 --> 08:47:35.413]  I think crime's going to drop.
[08:47:35.993 --> 08:47:37.573]  You know what I want to air?
[08:47:37.814 --> 08:47:40.874]  I want to air your report tonight, or I told you this morning.
[08:47:41.054 --> 08:47:46.656]  On the nightly news we're going to talk about martial law, but I want to air your report about troops trained to kill gun owners.
[08:47:47.336 --> 08:47:50.177]  I want to play that before we go back to the guys to take phone calls.
[08:47:50.757 --> 08:47:51.197]  Thanks buddy.
[08:47:51.417 --> 08:47:51.797]  Good job.
[08:47:52.298 --> 08:47:54.158]  And I know you're, I appreciate you working so hard.
[08:47:54.958 --> 08:47:56.299]  Anyways, getting back to what I was saying.
[08:48:00.709 --> 08:48:03.151]  You know, I don't even need to sit here and convince people about this.
[08:48:03.531 --> 08:48:09.055]  You've seen every drama, every sitcom, every show, Pillsbury ads where the TSA grubs you.
[08:48:09.415 --> 08:48:12.257]  The bad guys are conservative libertarians, gun owners.
[08:48:12.578 --> 08:48:13.438]  They're going to attack.
[08:48:13.478 --> 08:48:14.499]  They work with Al Qaeda.
[08:48:14.859 --> 08:48:16.000]  Just asinine stuff.
[08:48:16.180 --> 08:48:17.521]  And now this happens.
[08:48:17.681 --> 08:48:20.083]  And it's photo finish, Boston Marathon.
[08:48:20.383 --> 08:48:28.829]  They either wound up some real extremist and let them do it, like the New York Times reports, where the feds cook the bomb, train the drivers, and the World Trade Center bombing back in the early 90s.
[08:48:30.050 --> 08:48:32.471]  Or they stage the whole deal and will burn a Patsy.
[08:48:33.012 --> 08:48:35.913]  No Tea Party person would work with Al Qaeda like they're trying to claim.
[08:48:36.573 --> 08:48:42.856]  And Saudi Arabia, this is the most important point, Saudi Arabia and the West are like this.
[08:48:43.056 --> 08:48:45.077]  I mean, they are peas in a pod.
[08:48:45.497 --> 08:48:48.579]  They are absolutely together on this thing.
[08:48:50.359 --> 08:48:53.722]  And our government is running Al-Qaeda in Libya and Syria.
[08:48:53.862 --> 08:48:57.024]  I declared Obama the head of Al-Qaeda worldwide last month.
[08:48:57.064 --> 08:48:57.765]  I mean, he is.
[08:48:58.445 --> 08:49:00.407]  I mean, our government, but it's so off the script.
[08:49:00.447 --> 08:49:05.851]  It's like, yeah, it's in the LA Times, our government runs Al-Qaeda and they're ethnically cleansing Christians in Syria.
[08:49:06.591 --> 08:49:26.233]  I mean, chopping their heads off, you name it, it's like, oh, well that's, they're nobody, yeah, chopping their heads off, but, oh, the Boston Marathon, let's personalize it, and then it's okay to get sad, and everybody's like, on our Patriots Day, they're on the news going, America got hit on Patriots Day, but we're getting behind the government now to do what it takes to keep America successful.
[08:49:27.074 --> 08:49:29.376]  I mean, this is nothing but the occupational government.
[08:49:29.896 --> 08:49:39.944]  Bottom line, you've seen all the scripting, you've seen the build-up, you've seen us tell you it's coming, and it's just thoroughly, thoroughly, thoroughly disgusting.
[08:49:40.244 --> 08:49:41.805]  Let's go back over some of these articles.
[08:49:42.426 --> 08:49:46.849]  UM Coach, bomb-sniffing dogs were at start-finish lines for drill.
[08:49:48.190 --> 08:49:49.672]  And people are like, well, they already got dogs.
[08:49:49.732 --> 08:49:53.675]  Again, making announcements on the loudspeaker that it was just a drill.
[08:49:54.844 --> 08:49:55.364]  There was nothing.
[08:49:55.444 --> 08:49:56.665]  Oh, we have the announcements on video?
[08:49:57.345 --> 08:49:59.186]  Oh my God, let's play those video clips right now.
[08:50:00.527 --> 08:50:01.067]  Unbelievable.
[08:50:05.829 --> 08:50:06.770]  We have the announcements.
[08:50:07.490 --> 08:50:10.732]  We're doing all this live, so we'll get those clips.
[08:50:10.772 --> 08:50:12.893]  I was told we had that, but you know, these stupid computers.
[08:50:13.936 --> 08:50:17.317]  But that's all up at M4Wars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[08:50:18.198 --> 08:50:20.599]  And again, folks, I don't want to risk my life for them to win.
[08:50:21.199 --> 08:50:23.640]  I wouldn't be risking my life if I didn't think we could get out of this.
[08:50:24.140 --> 08:50:37.286]  I mean, I am willing to be set up or destroyed just so our future isn't run by whoever will stage terror attacks, and whoever runs the media, and the military-industrial complex run by foreign banks stages an attack, and then all of the
[08:50:40.270 --> 08:50:44.035]  You know, prostitute media goes along with it, and it just goes on and on.
[08:50:44.096 --> 08:50:44.957]  Do we have that clip?
[08:50:47.100 --> 08:50:47.961]  Yeah, yeah, okay.
[08:50:48.502 --> 08:50:49.684]  Yeah, it's the coach talking about it.
[08:50:49.704 --> 08:50:50.385]  Let's go ahead and play it then.
[08:50:51.516 --> 08:51:09.545]  At the start line this morning, they had bomb spotters on the roof of the building, and they had bomb-sniffing dogs coming up and down at the start line, and Melanie said there was bomb-sniffing dogs at the finish line, but they kept making announcements saying to the participants, do not worry, this is just a training exercise.
[08:51:10.386 --> 08:51:16.969]  Well, evidently I don't believe they were just having a training exercise, I think they must have known, they must have had some kind of threat or suspicion called in.
[08:51:18.547 --> 08:51:19.788]  You know, I bet they had a threat.
[08:51:19.808 --> 08:51:21.629]  Well, they'll get to grandstand as our saviors.
[08:51:22.109 --> 08:51:31.414]  Again, the narrative that veterans will attack every police station in America that's been put out for four years is a fraud to frame the American people against this takeover.
[08:51:31.954 --> 08:51:36.097]  And they may be going back to the script because no one would buy that right-wingers are terrorists.
[08:51:36.697 --> 08:51:38.318]  They may be going back to the Al-Qaeda script.
[08:51:38.338 --> 08:51:39.619]  They're saying it could be Al-Qaeda.
[08:51:39.839 --> 08:51:41.460]  But again, our government runs Al-Qaeda.
[08:51:42.120 --> 08:51:42.600]  On record.
[08:51:43.220 --> 08:51:49.362]  And puts them in Libya and Syria and gives them 10,000 heat-seeking, shoulder-fired, surface-to-air missiles.
[08:51:49.782 --> 08:51:50.942]  So none of this holds water.
[08:51:51.222 --> 08:51:53.263]  Here's the other articles up at Infowars.com.
[08:51:55.123 --> 08:51:55.743]  Eyewitnesses.
[08:51:55.803 --> 08:51:58.104]  Authorities announced drill before Boston explosions.
[08:51:58.224 --> 08:51:59.544]  UM coach thought it was odd.
[08:51:59.984 --> 08:52:01.905]  Bomb sniffing dogs are at the start and finish lines.
[08:52:02.405 --> 08:52:03.265]  Great headline, Watson.
[08:52:03.285 --> 08:52:04.806]  We're working until midnight tonight, your time.
[08:52:04.826 --> 08:52:06.726]  But the big issue is the announcements.
[08:52:06.766 --> 08:52:07.806]  That's unprecedented.
[08:52:08.186 --> 08:52:10.467]  And they said it was a drill, not security.
[08:52:12.634 --> 08:52:13.895]  So that's just some of the news.
[08:52:14.335 --> 08:52:14.695]  Here it is.
[08:52:14.755 --> 08:52:16.176]  Authorities ID.
[08:52:16.456 --> 08:52:17.117]  Not servants.
[08:52:17.297 --> 08:52:18.037]  Authorities.
[08:52:18.497 --> 08:52:19.598]  They're an authority or not.
[08:52:20.158 --> 08:52:26.162]  ID suspect is Saudi National in marathon bombings under guard at Boston Hospital.
[08:52:27.677 --> 08:52:34.566]  Well, if it turns out to be Saudi Arabian Muslims that did it, Wahhabists, let's invade Iran, the Shiite country.
[08:52:34.886 --> 08:52:39.151]  We invaded Iraq, the quasi-secular Ba'athist party.
[08:52:39.552 --> 08:52:41.074]  In fact, why don't we invade Australia?
[08:52:41.554 --> 08:52:42.155]  You know what, I mean...
[08:52:43.447 --> 08:52:45.308]  Can you bring me the globe in from another office?
[08:52:45.448 --> 08:52:46.268]  We've got a bunch of guys.
[08:52:46.708 --> 08:52:48.109]  Maybe we just spin the globe.
[08:52:48.129 --> 08:52:51.650]  Because last time they blamed Iraq and planted WMDs on them.
[08:52:51.950 --> 08:52:55.192]  Maybe we just spin the globe, cover our eyes, and touch it.
[08:52:55.952 --> 08:53:00.434]  And if it's in the middle of the Indian Ocean, we go nuke the Indian Ocean.
[08:53:01.494 --> 08:53:03.635]  And show film going, flying fish did it.
[08:53:04.096 --> 08:53:06.437]  Because, or those whales did it.
[08:53:06.937 --> 08:53:10.139]  Because this is the type of crap that I'm talking about here.
[08:53:11.040 --> 08:53:16.123]  This is the type of unmitigated garbage that we're dealing with as a society.
[08:53:18.610 --> 08:53:20.291]  Oh yeah, spotters on the roofs, everything.
[08:53:20.511 --> 08:53:23.432]  Well, everything's a national security event.
[08:53:23.972 --> 08:53:29.153]  And just like Madrid, where it came out in Spain, the government did it, and had to step down on 333.
[08:53:29.433 --> 08:53:32.454]  By the way, that was the first time I ever went on Coast to Coast AM.
[08:53:33.034 --> 08:53:34.435]  It was the day of the Madrid bombing.
[08:53:34.455 --> 08:53:35.475]  It had been set up for weeks.
[08:53:35.855 --> 08:53:37.996]  I'm on Coast to Coast AM for three hours tomorrow night.
[08:53:39.336 --> 08:53:42.677]  And obviously we'll be talking about all this and a lot more, coasttocoastam.com.
[08:53:43.698 --> 08:53:44.158]  It's just...
[08:53:45.038 --> 08:53:49.201]  Unbelievable that stuff like this is going on.
[08:53:49.502 --> 08:54:01.631]  And again, you've got the former head of Italian intelligence, you've got all their Supreme Court coming out saying the West is staging these terror attacks.
[08:54:04.637 --> 08:54:05.597]  It is, piece of paper.
[08:54:06.418 --> 08:54:08.679]  It is off the charts.
[08:54:09.799 --> 08:54:19.503]  And we're going to play a report here by Rob Due from last year that's had two and a half million views, dealing with the Army manual saying they're trained to kill gun owners.
[08:54:19.924 --> 08:54:20.484]  I mean, folks,
[08:54:21.224 --> 08:54:34.188]  If you study military history, when the government's training the police and military that gun owners are terrorists, and the preachers need to tell them to go to the FEMA camp when it's time, and the military's training for gun confiscation, that is off-the-chart creep-ville.
[08:54:34.808 --> 08:54:46.092]  So, even if they try to blame this on Saudi Arabia, they're trying to gauge things right now, the media has already tried to lump right-wing extremism, gun owners, conservatives, in with
[08:54:47.435 --> 08:54:50.557]  Al-Qaeda by saying it'll be Al-Qaeda or it'll be right-wingers.
[08:54:50.917 --> 08:54:55.360]  What, it's not the Mexican mafia that's killed 60,000 people in Mexico, thousands in the U.S.?
[08:54:56.421 --> 08:54:58.642]  It's not even white supremacists that have killed people?
[08:54:59.342 --> 08:55:00.383]  It's not some other group?
[08:55:00.723 --> 08:55:08.668]  No, it's automatically right-wingers, which means anti-globalists, not fake right-wingers, but you know, more libertarian types they call right-wingers, or
[08:55:10.143 --> 08:55:10.743]  It's Al-Qaeda.
[08:55:10.763 --> 08:55:17.165]  Because there's only one thing worse than Al-Qaeda, and that's a returning veteran or gun owner or grandma that we haven't been able to kill yet.
[08:55:17.245 --> 08:55:22.286]  So, Saudi Arabia, 15 of the 19 hijackers, NORAD stands down.
[08:55:23.546 --> 08:55:32.809]  Saudi Arabia, right over here, Saudi Arabia doesn't get attacked on 9-11.
[08:55:33.989 --> 08:55:36.790]  Iraq, two years later, gets invaded and blamed for it.
[08:55:38.174 --> 08:55:43.857]  Now they're trying to see Iran's behind Al-Qaeda when they hate them more than they hate us, the Mullahs.
[08:55:44.177 --> 08:55:44.877]  They're Shiite.
[08:55:45.658 --> 08:55:47.619]  See, this is Wahhabist.
[08:55:48.139 --> 08:55:48.860]  This is Sunni.
[08:55:49.400 --> 08:55:50.801]  Not all Sunnis are bad, by the way.
[08:55:51.121 --> 08:55:52.381]  Just the ones the globalists fund.
[08:55:52.882 --> 08:55:58.765]  And they've sent out of Saudi Arabia into Syria, into Libya, all over the world.
[08:55:59.765 --> 08:56:13.872]  In Afghanistan, Pakistan, they send the British intelligence brigades, the British set up over a hundred years ago, Lawrence of Arabia, into all these places to destabilize, and then our government, the globalists, bomb and attack all these countries to go after their own people.
[08:56:15.793 --> 08:56:22.096]  They put them in, and then though we're so dumb, they attack Shiites and Ba'athists, saying it's to stop Al Qaeda.
[08:56:22.616 --> 08:56:25.217]  It's the opposite group that comes out of Saudi Arabia.
[08:56:26.318 --> 08:56:27.258]  So, 9-11 happened.
[08:56:29.571 --> 08:56:38.019]  And they didn't go after Saudi Arabia, who supplied the cutouts.
[08:56:38.419 --> 08:56:39.640]  The globalists actually ran it.
[08:56:39.660 --> 08:56:40.521]  The big banks ran it.
[08:56:41.281 --> 08:56:42.162]  They went after Iraq.
[08:56:43.467 --> 08:56:51.549]  And now they're putting Al-Qaeda from Saudi Arabia in charge of Libya and Syria and using Al-Qaeda to threaten the West.
[08:56:51.589 --> 08:56:59.031]  They can take our rights over here, bombings all over Europe, bombings in the U.S., blaming it on Al-Qaeda, so they can take our rights when they actually run Al-Qaeda.
[08:56:59.451 --> 08:57:04.052]  Now, if it ends up being Saudi Arabia, do you think they're going to attack Saudi Arabia?
[08:57:04.392 --> 08:57:04.892]  No, they're not.
[08:57:05.513 --> 08:57:06.453]  They're going to attack
[08:57:07.273 --> 08:57:08.534]  They're going to attack Iran.
[08:57:09.254 --> 08:57:17.219]  And ignore the fact that our government's funding Al-Qaeda and sponsoring them out of Saudi Arabia, into Syria, into other areas.
[08:57:17.600 --> 08:57:19.741]  So, now let's do this on air.
[08:57:19.761 --> 08:57:30.928]  I'm going to close my eyes, instead of attacking Iran, and they said they could start World War III, I'll just spin the wheel like they did blaming Iraq, and then we'll just attack whoever we randomly pick.
[08:57:31.248 --> 08:57:34.270]  Maybe this is how the Pentagon, maybe this is how the Pentagon chooses people.
[08:57:34.610 --> 08:57:35.311]  Three spins.
[08:57:37.811 --> 08:57:38.311]  Okay.
[08:57:39.012 --> 08:57:39.873]  Ethiopia.
[08:57:40.533 --> 08:57:42.915]  We will now nuke Ethiopia.
[08:57:42.975 --> 08:57:44.216]  That's where it came from.
[08:57:44.696 --> 08:57:46.057]  Does it matter it came from here?
[08:57:46.077 --> 08:57:48.159]  Isn't that funny?
[08:57:48.199 --> 08:57:49.840]  I spun it three times and it was still close to there?
[08:57:51.562 --> 08:57:52.402]  Hey, let's spin it again.
[08:57:53.003 --> 08:57:53.443]  You know what?
[08:57:53.583 --> 08:57:54.144]  Let's try it again.
[08:57:54.164 --> 08:57:55.925]  Let's see what happens now.
[08:57:57.486 --> 08:57:57.966]  Uh-oh!
[08:57:59.468 --> 08:57:59.768]  St.
[08:57:59.828 --> 08:58:04.712]  Vincent and the Grenada.
[08:58:04.792 --> 08:58:05.492]  Grenada did it.
[08:58:05.772 --> 08:58:06.173]  Attack them.
[08:58:07.546 --> 08:58:08.446]  Almost Venezuela!
[08:58:09.326 --> 08:58:09.886]  They did it!
[08:58:09.906 --> 08:58:10.307]  Attack!
[08:58:11.907 --> 08:58:14.587]  It's weird, I keep spinning this and picking globalist enemies.
[08:58:14.627 --> 08:58:15.267]  Let's try again.
[08:58:19.008 --> 08:58:19.508]  Okay.
[08:58:20.088 --> 08:58:21.008]  New Guinea.
[08:58:22.029 --> 08:58:23.289]  New Guinea is the enemy.
[08:58:23.349 --> 08:58:24.369]  They ran Al-Qaeda.
[08:58:24.949 --> 08:58:27.089]  No one but Saudi Arabia and the West.
[08:58:27.109 --> 08:58:27.890]  We'll attack no one.
[08:58:28.110 --> 08:58:29.030]  Here, let's spin it again.
[08:58:32.650 --> 08:58:32.910]  Oops.
[08:58:34.231 --> 08:58:35.451]  Here, let's try it again.
[08:58:38.680 --> 08:58:40.000]  We'll attack two places this time.
[08:58:40.661 --> 08:58:41.181]  Okay.
[08:58:42.281 --> 08:58:43.942]  New Hanover is an island.
[08:58:43.962 --> 08:58:44.722]  We'll attack it.
[08:58:45.922 --> 08:58:53.004]  And the Chargos Archipelagos oil islands.
[08:58:53.044 --> 08:58:53.825]  We'll nuke them.
[08:58:54.825 --> 08:58:55.265]  They did it!
[08:58:55.285 --> 08:58:57.426]  Here, let's spin it again.
[08:58:58.966 --> 08:59:01.587]  Anybody in the West has a history of staging terror?
[08:59:02.667 --> 08:59:03.748]  Saudi Arabia works with them.
[08:59:03.768 --> 08:59:04.508]  Let's not attack them.
[08:59:08.183 --> 08:59:09.423]  Uh-oh, Canada.
[08:59:11.044 --> 08:59:13.705]  Folks, time to nuke Canada.
[08:59:13.905 --> 08:59:14.525]  Blame Canada.
[08:59:14.585 --> 08:59:15.966]  Right there, nuke them.
[08:59:16.006 --> 08:59:17.006]  That's Northern Canada.
[08:59:17.527 --> 08:59:19.267]  Luckily not too big a population right there.
[08:59:19.307 --> 08:59:20.648]  We'll just blow that up right there.
[08:59:20.668 --> 08:59:22.348]  Because that's who did it.
[08:59:23.389 --> 08:59:24.869]  I mean, hell, CNN said so.
[08:59:24.889 --> 08:59:25.410]  There you go.
[08:59:26.410 --> 08:59:27.470]  You guys like my targeting?
[08:59:27.951 --> 08:59:28.651]  How I pick targets?
[08:59:33.833 --> 08:59:40.114]  Okay, I gotta say Badandi, you know, Badandi's awesome, but you know, his wife and child were up there in Rhode Island.
[08:59:40.134 --> 08:59:40.715]  I felt bad.
[08:59:40.735 --> 08:59:45.556]  A lot of these reporters that I ended up hiring came down here, and you know, it was family stuff.
[08:59:45.576 --> 08:59:49.377]  Families in Rhode Island, families in New Jersey, there's family stuff.
[08:59:49.397 --> 08:59:50.857]  I'm like, hey, I'm not gonna get in the way of families.
[08:59:51.197 --> 08:59:56.138]  But he still does reports every week for us as an auxiliary reporter, and he does a great job.
[08:59:56.158 --> 08:59:57.078]  Badandi's got a lot of heart.
[08:59:58.399 --> 08:59:59.719]  I haven't even gotten to Dan Badandi.
[09:00:01.377 --> 09:00:05.442]  Getting on Fox, asking the police commissioner about the drills.
[09:00:06.943 --> 09:00:12.650]  And then, I talked to Badandi before I went on air here, and I said, okay, there's another press conference, get in and ask him about false flag.
[09:00:12.910 --> 09:00:13.972]  Do we have that video coming in?
[09:00:20.755 --> 09:00:24.537]  Well, just whatever you get, just make sure they air it coming up in the next segment.
[09:00:24.857 --> 09:00:26.177]  And obviously I'm very exhausted.
[09:00:26.437 --> 09:00:27.898]  I'm not complaining.
[09:00:27.938 --> 09:00:29.199]  I went to bed at midnight last night.
[09:00:29.259 --> 09:00:31.379]  I woke up at 4 a.m., couldn't sleep.
[09:00:31.740 --> 09:00:32.580]  I never used to be like that.
[09:00:32.620 --> 09:00:34.301]  I just have been totally freaked out.
[09:00:35.321 --> 09:00:39.343]  And I'm not complaining, but I am pretty tired right now, pretty punch drunk.
[09:00:40.684 --> 09:00:41.544]  I should have had more coffee.
[09:00:41.564 --> 09:00:42.766]  The last coffee I had was at about 1.
[09:00:42.926 --> 09:00:51.414]  And I'm gonna go to sleep here in a couple hours and get up and deal with all this because when they lock my ass up, knock on wood, I hope they don't or kill me.
[09:00:51.574 --> 09:00:53.516]  I mean, I don't have any time to talk to you anymore.
[09:00:55.398 --> 09:00:56.879]  They say there's no rest for the wicked.
[09:00:57.259 --> 09:00:58.200]  I don't feel very wicked.
[09:00:58.260 --> 09:00:59.181]  I just want justice.
[09:00:59.241 --> 09:01:02.624]  I mean, I'm so sick of the obvious PR rollout for this stuff.
[09:01:02.664 --> 09:01:03.725]  I mean, it's so obvious.
[09:01:04.816 --> 09:01:07.300]  And I just want my country back.
[09:01:07.400 --> 09:01:12.868]  I mean, it's just the gullibility of this nation and the West is what has allowed all of this to unfold.
[09:01:13.168 --> 09:01:14.330]  Did Badani get his question in?
[09:01:19.943 --> 09:01:20.704]  You want to come in here?
[09:01:20.764 --> 09:01:21.244]  Come on in here.
[09:01:21.264 --> 09:01:22.125]  This is very powerful.
[09:01:24.206 --> 09:01:28.850]  You know, Badandi is kind of like a wild man like I am, but he's a real guy.
[09:01:28.890 --> 09:01:29.730]  That's what we like about him.
[09:01:30.071 --> 09:01:30.831]  Tell me about Badandi.
[09:01:30.891 --> 09:01:31.151]  Okay.
[09:01:31.632 --> 09:01:32.813]  I'm just getting this from John Bowne.
[09:01:32.853 --> 09:01:33.433]  He just called me.
[09:01:33.453 --> 09:01:37.897]  He said Badandi got his question in on the press conference to the governor.
[09:01:37.917 --> 09:01:39.278]  It's actually the governor of Massachusetts.
[09:01:39.998 --> 09:01:41.159]  Asked if it was a false flag.
[09:01:41.379 --> 09:01:42.980]  He said, no, next question.
[09:01:43.100 --> 09:01:43.980]  Real quick, cut him off.
[09:01:44.401 --> 09:01:46.722]  And then apparently he's still asking questions.
[09:01:46.762 --> 09:01:47.663]  He's not shutting up.
[09:01:47.803 --> 09:01:49.364]  You know, he's being Badandi.
[09:01:49.584 --> 09:01:50.744]  You know, basically that's it.
[09:01:50.884 --> 09:01:52.465]  And so we're grabbing that footage.
[09:01:52.966 --> 09:01:55.527]  It's on Fox is where we're grabbing it right now.
[09:01:55.627 --> 09:01:56.528]  We'll have it up.
[09:01:56.948 --> 09:02:00.470]  When we go back to the other guys over on the other side, we're going to connect with them.
[09:02:00.490 --> 09:02:01.211]  I think we're on that.
[09:02:01.231 --> 09:02:02.011]  Be honest with me.
[09:02:02.031 --> 09:02:03.472]  I want the listeners to realize what they're viewing.
[09:02:04.432 --> 09:02:05.073]  This is history.
[09:02:05.393 --> 09:02:06.153]  Oh yeah, this is it.
[09:02:06.194 --> 09:02:11.697]  I mean, this is, all the pieces apparently have come together, you know, Badandi going up northeast, you know.
[09:02:11.717 --> 09:02:17.420]  No, but I mean, not even that, just the fact that, I use the cheesy analogy of the trench run with X-Wings, I mean, this is it.
[09:02:17.440 --> 09:02:18.221]  Oh yeah, this is it.
[09:02:18.561 --> 09:02:20.422]  I hope people sitting at home realize, I mean...
[09:02:21.621 --> 09:02:22.662]  And we need your tips, too.
[09:02:22.722 --> 09:02:26.286]  You know, people out there scouring the internet, like when Sandy Hook happened.
[09:02:26.306 --> 09:02:31.551]  Like, all the great research that people were doing out there, putting it out on their own, not waiting for us to put it out.
[09:02:31.611 --> 09:02:33.193]  Hey, it's shaking the system up.
[09:02:33.213 --> 09:02:37.578]  Yeah, I mean... Because they're targeting totally dumbed-down people that buy anything.
[09:02:37.818 --> 09:02:39.580]  And more and more people just don't buy anything.
[09:02:40.051 --> 09:02:40.992]  Yeah, yeah.
[09:02:41.292 --> 09:02:43.655]  And this is just, I mean, I think it's amazing.
[09:02:43.675 --> 09:02:51.462]  Just the amount of research people have done on Colorado and Sandy Hook is just, you know... I'm just glad that when I died, I didn't die a coward.
[09:02:51.482 --> 09:02:52.664]  You two did a great job.
[09:02:52.804 --> 09:02:53.084]  Thank you.
[09:02:53.144 --> 09:02:54.245]  I mean, it's just...
[09:02:55.366 --> 09:02:57.027]  We don't even pat ourselves on the back, though.
[09:02:57.408 --> 09:03:01.590]  The build-up where every show... We got that clip.
[09:03:01.610 --> 09:03:03.091]  The Liberty People are terrorists.
[09:03:03.211 --> 09:03:07.974]  We got the Jacari piece where he shows just every single instance where... That's just locally, lately.
[09:03:08.234 --> 09:03:08.915]  Yeah, you want to play that?
[09:03:09.275 --> 09:03:15.259]  Yeah, well, this is the one that has that TV show, The Following, where the guy goes, heh heh, I'm a constitutional extremist.
[09:03:15.359 --> 09:03:18.441]  And the top psycho's like, whoa, that's the most evil thing, I like that.
[09:03:18.581 --> 09:03:20.362]  He did one with a bunch of clips.
[09:03:20.402 --> 09:03:21.643]  Is this the little one or the big one?
[09:03:21.683 --> 09:03:24.345]  This is the little one of that with a bunch of others.
[09:03:24.605 --> 09:03:30.370]  Because you and David Knight talked about it, and that one's up on YouTube.
[09:03:30.470 --> 09:03:32.412]  Yeah, Green Lantern fights the militia.
[09:03:32.432 --> 09:03:32.652]  Right, right.
[09:03:32.673 --> 09:03:33.233]  It's got Green Lantern.
[09:03:33.293 --> 09:03:36.876]  I mean, you know, it's like before World War II when they figured out they were going to have to fight the Germans.
[09:03:37.257 --> 09:03:39.519]  Suddenly, for the year before, we're going to have to fight the Germans again.
[09:03:39.539 --> 09:03:42.301]  I mean, now it's, we're going to fight the veterans and gun owners.
[09:03:42.361 --> 09:03:43.843]  You know, it's like, okay.
[09:03:44.003 --> 09:03:47.867]  All the cartoon guys were fighting guys with pointed helmets in the 1940s.
[09:03:47.907 --> 09:03:49.168]  That was part of that build-up to that.
[09:03:49.568 --> 09:03:52.329]  It's all on, like, right before 9-11, they had the Pearl Harbor movie.
[09:03:52.629 --> 09:03:54.149]  Hey, let's go ahead and go to that clip.
[09:03:54.169 --> 09:03:54.549]  Here it is.
[09:03:58.810 --> 09:04:02.251]  The cell tower linked to your wife is near a roadside motel on Highway 31.
[09:04:02.291 --> 09:04:07.992]  Typically, there's five to six agents per safe house in a designated area away from the other guests.
[09:04:08.272 --> 09:04:11.333]  I'm thinking an M-17 or my micro-Uzi with a silencer.
[09:04:13.959 --> 09:04:14.840]  You ex-military.
[09:04:15.400 --> 09:04:15.901]  Hell no.
[09:04:16.261 --> 09:04:17.042]  We're better than that.
[09:04:17.603 --> 09:04:19.004]  They were both raised by a militia.
[09:04:19.384 --> 09:04:20.846]  What constitutional extremists?
[09:04:22.546 --> 09:04:22.966]  To be accurate.
[09:04:23.407 --> 09:04:29.492]  The following, a Fox TV series starring Kevin Bacon, is the latest television program to demonize the militia.
[09:04:29.512 --> 09:04:32.634]  I'm Jakari Jackson with an InfoWars News Bulletin.
[09:04:33.134 --> 09:04:40.620]  Even though the Constitution guarantees the rights of a well-regulated militia, that has not stopped the mass media from portraying the militia in a negative light.
[09:04:41.121 --> 09:04:44.624]  Let's take a look at these clips where the hero fights militia antagonist.
[09:04:45.204 --> 09:04:48.827]  Next Thursday, to save a young boy's life, Michael Weston takes on a militia.
[09:04:48.847 --> 09:04:49.928]  They are locked down tight.
[09:04:50.228 --> 09:04:53.470]  An unknown number of heavily armed militiamen have taken over the mine.
[09:04:53.730 --> 09:04:59.714]  They plan to use the salt mine as their base during the Second American Revolution, which is, they claim, imminent.
[09:05:07.307 --> 09:05:12.272]  More shows still, such as the in-development We Hate Paul Revere and Founding Fathers.
[09:05:12.592 --> 09:05:19.938]  The real programming is happening with these shows like Founding Fathers, where the guy that's pro-gun in Texas and leading the militia, he's really Al-Qaeda.
[09:05:20.319 --> 09:05:25.363]  Which fits into the whole narrative that, oh, it's white Al-Qaeda, or gun owners are really Al-Qaeda.
[09:05:25.804 --> 09:05:31.489]  InfoWars has also documented subliminal propaganda in television shows such as AMC's Breaking Bad.
[09:05:32.369 --> 09:05:39.956]  One example is AMC's Breaking Bad television series as it depicts a meth villain as a Ron Paul supporter.
[09:05:40.296 --> 09:05:45.081]  And we'll end with a clip of Alex Jones warning of such propaganda in his film Road to Tyranny.
[09:05:45.541 --> 09:05:48.083]  I'm Jakari Jackson with an InfoWars News Bulletin.
[09:05:48.864 --> 09:05:51.146]  Who was the first terrorist organization in the United States?
[09:05:53.800 --> 09:05:54.040]  Who?
[09:05:54.240 --> 09:05:55.562]  Founding Fathers.
[09:05:55.622 --> 09:05:56.282]  Founding Fathers.
[09:05:56.382 --> 09:05:58.204]  You mean Thomas Jefferson?
[09:05:58.524 --> 09:05:59.105]  Look at this guy.
[09:05:59.745 --> 09:06:02.988]  He's talking about the Founding Fathers and people that are committed.
[09:06:03.008 --> 09:06:04.729]  He's talking about constitutional terrorists before that.
[09:06:05.090 --> 09:06:07.612]  The cops are so conditioned they say, who are the terrorists?
[09:06:07.892 --> 09:06:08.693]  Who are the first terrorists?
[09:06:08.713 --> 09:06:09.454]  The Founding Fathers.
[09:06:09.494 --> 09:06:09.994]  They all know.
[09:06:10.014 --> 09:06:10.895]  They all say Founding Fathers.
[09:06:16.602 --> 09:06:20.166]  Again, we're not trying to take credit for predicting all this.
[09:06:20.226 --> 09:06:20.846]  It's not hard.
[09:06:20.886 --> 09:06:24.590]  It's like I predict the sun comes up at 645 tomorrow morning.
[09:06:24.690 --> 09:06:28.474]  I mean, it's designed for the most dumbed-down population.
[09:06:28.554 --> 09:06:37.803]  I could go home tonight, turn on any drama, and it'll be, they won't take vaccines, they're child molesters, or they don't trust the government, they've murdered children, or
[09:06:38.504 --> 09:06:39.445]  They don't trust the government.
[09:06:39.465 --> 09:06:40.186]  They're racist.
[09:06:40.607 --> 09:06:41.448]  Or they're homeschooled.
[09:06:42.629 --> 09:06:44.852]  And it's like, or let's laugh at Charlton Heston.
[09:06:45.252 --> 09:06:45.993]  Ah, he's a murderer.
[09:06:46.434 --> 09:06:47.675]  You know, like Jim Carrey said.
[09:06:49.818 --> 09:06:52.020]  It's just ham-fisted propaganda.
[09:06:52.080 --> 09:06:53.682]  But see, I didn't get into comic books.
[09:06:55.264 --> 09:06:56.305]  I got into history books.
[09:06:57.808 --> 09:06:58.268]  And girls.
[09:06:58.869 --> 09:07:01.770]  Kind of a mixed deal.
[09:07:02.451 --> 09:07:09.734]  I know because I started reading history books and every page was like battles and wars and subterfuge and this guy did this to that guy and this secret society.
[09:07:09.754 --> 09:07:12.796]  I mean, Roman history, Nazis, Communists.
[09:07:12.856 --> 09:07:14.097]  I mean, I couldn't put it down.
[09:07:15.998 --> 09:07:20.020]  I mean, I was like 15 and read Good Old Archipelago because it was action-packed.
[09:07:20.080 --> 09:07:21.941]  I mean, this is a guy in a forced labor camp.
[09:07:23.191 --> 09:07:25.533]  And I just, by the grace of God, learned all this stuff.
[09:07:26.433 --> 09:07:28.955]  And now I sit here watching the exact playbook.
[09:07:28.995 --> 09:07:36.160]  I mean, I was reading where AP has hired North Korean propagandists to help them advise them on how to run AP.
[09:07:36.781 --> 09:07:38.982]  And I saw that the other day in mainstream news.
[09:07:39.022 --> 09:07:40.764]  I mean, I can't even believe that.
[09:07:41.244 --> 09:07:52.172]  Our government hired the former head of the Stasi, the worst police state in human history up until the time, the East German Stasi, Marcus Wolf, to set up Homeland Security.
[09:07:56.144 --> 09:08:01.646]  I mean, obviously the government's super bad when they teach state police nationwide, the Christians are terrorists.
[09:08:02.126 --> 09:08:03.887]  We're going to have to arrest them en masse.
[09:08:04.527 --> 09:08:07.288]  And here's the army manual for forced labor camps.
[09:08:07.688 --> 09:08:11.689]  I mean, obviously, whoa, they're going to stage something.
[09:08:11.709 --> 09:08:13.430]  They've done it before.
[09:08:13.890 --> 09:08:15.370]  We've got to do something.
[09:08:17.231 --> 09:08:18.511]  And it's just creepy.
[09:08:19.792 --> 09:08:20.212]  Creepy.
[09:08:22.253 --> 09:08:30.595]  To know now that it's not just White House-run groups like Media Matters and BBC Connected that are demonizing me right now, but Glenn Beck again.
[09:08:31.975 --> 09:08:34.815]  And it just is really despicable.
[09:08:38.956 --> 09:08:40.277]  I've covered a lot of this news.
[09:08:40.597 --> 09:08:47.258]  I want to throw it back for 30 minutes to Jakari Jackson and to
[09:08:49.315 --> 09:08:51.957]  David Knight and the rest of the great crew that's working so hard.
[09:08:51.977 --> 09:08:55.741]  We've got to shut this down in the next hour so everybody can get back, get some sleep.
[09:08:55.761 --> 09:08:56.601]  We have a limited crew.
[09:08:56.621 --> 09:09:03.868]  We're not CNN or Fox News or MSNBC funded by big corporate donors and tax money and stuff like MSNBC especially.
[09:09:04.228 --> 09:09:05.469]  We're funded by viewers like you.
[09:09:05.509 --> 09:09:08.071]  Please don't forget we're sending free streams out of all this.
[09:09:08.111 --> 09:09:09.232]  The video is very expensive.
[09:09:09.592 --> 09:09:11.434]  Be sure and support InfoWarsTore.com.
[09:09:11.774 --> 09:09:13.296]  Get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership.
[09:09:13.316 --> 09:09:14.277]  Buy the books, the videos.
[09:09:14.617 --> 09:09:16.739]  Support us so we can be strong and do more of this.
[09:09:17.439 --> 09:09:18.460]  That's always essential.
[09:09:18.520 --> 09:09:19.381]  Buy your war bonds.
[09:09:20.242 --> 09:09:22.064]  But in a few minutes we'll go to this.
[09:09:22.104 --> 09:09:29.712]  Then when I come back, we'll have the new clips of Dan Bodondi talking to the governor of Massachusetts about false flags, what happened in the aftermath of that.
[09:09:29.772 --> 09:09:30.532]  Great job, Dan.
[09:09:31.353 --> 09:09:34.636]  And I will get to the other newscast and things.
[09:09:35.537 --> 09:09:40.923]  But are they ready to make the switch to the other studio?
[09:09:51.690 --> 09:09:54.613]  Yeah, why don't you just play my video intro where they try to blame right-wingers?
[09:09:55.894 --> 09:09:56.474]  Remember that one?
[09:09:59.837 --> 09:10:00.578]  Or just pick something.
[09:10:00.618 --> 09:10:03.720]  The key to being live is, let's just pick something and go with it here.
[09:10:04.881 --> 09:10:06.343]  So, just whatever.
[09:10:06.543 --> 09:10:07.644]  We'll go ahead and go to the other...
[09:10:13.632 --> 09:10:24.635]  Yeah, this is the earlier Dan Bodondi footage where he got into the press conference and brought up the drills with myself and Leanne McAdoo and Rob Dew.
[09:10:24.895 --> 09:10:29.297]  And then we'll go to the other crew for 30 minutes and I'll come back with final points and final clips.
[09:10:29.317 --> 09:10:29.797]  Let's go to that.
[09:10:34.039 --> 09:10:38.283]  Hey guys, Leanne McAdoo here at the Austin, Texas, InfoWars News Center.
[09:10:38.663 --> 09:10:44.268]  Our East Coast reporter, Dan Bodondi, is on the scene and he was able to get in this question at the news conference.
[09:10:44.709 --> 09:10:46.610]  We are looking at all of that right now.
[09:10:46.630 --> 09:10:48.572]  That's one of the investigative steps that we're taking.
[09:10:48.872 --> 09:10:52.115]  We're very glad about all the content that you guys have staged out there.
[09:10:52.135 --> 09:10:56.739]  They said they were doing drills this morning and seeing exact things happen on a possible jump off.
[09:10:56.780 --> 09:11:00.423]  Now, were you guys given any warning ahead of time of this taking place?
[09:11:00.803 --> 09:11:03.004]  As I said earlier, there was no specific intelligence.
[09:11:03.484 --> 09:11:06.685]  We certainly increased posture around a big event like this.
[09:11:07.146 --> 09:11:13.828]  All of those things happened in preparation for this event, but there was no specific intelligence that anything was going to happen.
[09:11:14.749 --> 09:11:20.471]  Now we've got that story on our InfoWars.com website and you can check it out, follow up with more.
[09:11:21.323 --> 09:11:38.383]  Absolutely folks, it's all breaking there and a live feed is at InfoWars.com forward slash listen, a live video feed is there for everyone with Jakari Jackson, David Knight, myself and the rest of the crew, Rob Dew, John Bowne,
[09:11:40.154 --> 09:11:46.579]  The entire crew here, Adon Salazar, Kurt Nemo, they're all there right now covering all of this.
[09:11:46.679 --> 09:11:50.742]  And Leanne McAdoo is also on top of it as well.
[09:11:50.822 --> 09:11:56.246]  So this is a big deal, ladies and gentlemen, because so many of these past events have been false flags.
[09:11:56.286 --> 09:12:03.932]  We've got to study this and see if it is, because they want to have this total rollout of the police state an excuse to carry that out.
[09:12:04.653 --> 09:12:06.034]  Leanne, what else are you working on?
[09:12:07.179 --> 09:12:10.644]  Well, I've got some stories coming up about the drone strikes.
[09:12:11.065 --> 09:12:15.071]  Obama had just flat out lied about how many people have been struck with the drones.
[09:12:15.151 --> 09:12:17.695]  Maybe that's why we got this, to distract people.
[09:12:19.099 --> 09:12:19.840]  All right, great job.
[09:12:19.860 --> 09:12:20.941]  Dude, what else are you working on?
[09:12:21.281 --> 09:12:26.826]  Well, I'm going to try to follow up and see what happened with my brother-in-law, who was actually running in the marathon.
[09:12:26.986 --> 09:12:27.706]  For the Army?
[09:12:27.886 --> 09:12:28.347]  For the Army.
[09:12:28.367 --> 09:12:29.308]  And he's in intelligence.
[09:12:29.348 --> 09:12:30.489]  Tell folks what happened with him.
[09:12:30.509 --> 09:12:30.749]  Right.
[09:12:30.989 --> 09:12:33.971]  And apparently he got pulled out early of the race.
[09:12:34.011 --> 09:12:35.132]  They said he was dehydrated.
[09:12:35.633 --> 09:12:37.474]  So I'm trying to get a hold of him right now.
[09:12:37.494 --> 09:12:38.775]  I've been throwing text messages.
[09:12:38.795 --> 09:12:40.297]  You've got to go to the hospital.
[09:12:40.377 --> 09:12:41.057]  They came to him.
[09:12:41.117 --> 09:12:41.277]  Right.
[09:12:41.317 --> 09:12:44.060]  They pulled him out of the race, sent him to the hospital, said he was dehydrated.
[09:12:44.820 --> 09:12:45.700]  Wasn't that nice?
[09:12:45.780 --> 09:12:50.222]  In fact, Leeann, search engine real quick, Mayor Willie Brown got warning not to fly on 9-11.
[09:12:50.242 --> 09:12:50.362]  Right.
[09:12:50.522 --> 09:12:53.623]  It's the second link San Francisco Chronicle.
[09:12:53.663 --> 09:12:59.825]  Condoleezza Rice actually warned and gave him a phone call, personal phone call, which he said he didn't make much, didn't think much of it then.
[09:12:59.845 --> 09:13:07.787]  You know, when the Secretary of the National Security calls you and tells you not to fly, I guess it's not a big deal.
[09:13:07.807 --> 09:13:09.588]  You know, so there you go.
[09:13:09.628 --> 09:13:12.069]  And now we also have reports of the U of M coach,
[09:13:13.189 --> 09:13:15.691]  The cross-country coach said that... They have loudspeakers.
[09:13:15.711 --> 09:13:17.853]  Yeah, that's up on Infowars.com.
[09:13:18.073 --> 09:13:25.420]  They have loudspeakers on there openly announcing, hey, it's just a drill, don't worry about the dogs.
[09:13:26.000 --> 09:13:28.002]  And then you can also go to, again,
[09:13:28.871 --> 09:13:30.612]  Yeah, that's a saved version.
[09:13:30.632 --> 09:13:33.513]  Willie Brown got low-key warning not to travel.
[09:13:33.533 --> 09:13:36.855]  But if you actually go back, and good job finding that live.
[09:13:36.875 --> 09:13:37.475]  You're on the fly.
[09:13:37.495 --> 09:13:39.096]  We're basically taping this live.
[09:13:39.836 --> 09:13:41.356]  There it is, San Francisco Chronicle.
[09:13:41.837 --> 09:13:42.317]  Boom!
[09:13:42.957 --> 09:13:46.979]  Willie Brown got low-key early warning about air travel.
[09:13:47.019 --> 09:13:49.360]  And again, the Joint Chiefs of Staff are supposed to fly to New York.
[09:13:49.640 --> 09:13:50.340]  We're told not to.
[09:13:50.781 --> 09:13:51.801]  I mean, this is incredible.
[09:13:51.861 --> 09:13:53.302]  And again, if your brother
[09:13:54.276 --> 09:13:59.157]  Are your brother-in-law, your wife's brother, again, you say he's a great marathon guy?
[09:13:59.177 --> 09:13:59.977]  Yeah, he's a champ.
[09:13:59.997 --> 09:14:01.398]  Runs two miles for breakfast, you name it.
[09:14:01.778 --> 09:14:02.678]  Boom, this happens.
[09:14:02.758 --> 09:14:03.578]  Very suspicious.
[09:14:03.598 --> 09:14:05.938]  We need to ask him, you know, were you really, quote, sick?
[09:14:05.978 --> 09:14:06.859]  Why'd they pull you out?
[09:14:06.879 --> 09:14:07.159]  Right.
[09:14:07.199 --> 09:14:09.539]  I know you're getting the secondhand through your wife who talked to him.
[09:14:09.819 --> 09:14:12.040]  All right, well that's it for this report.
[09:14:12.080 --> 09:14:18.101]  Great job to the entire crew, and great job doing the work you're doing, and great job to all the listeners getting us the tips.
[09:14:18.141 --> 09:14:21.662]  Follow us at Twitter at RealAlexJones, ladies and gentlemen.
[09:14:21.942 --> 09:14:23.422]  The investigation continues.
[09:14:23.982 --> 09:14:30.108]  Alright, so we're back here live.
[09:14:30.148 --> 09:14:38.715]  This is David Knight here with Jakari Jackson and we're going to be taking some of your calls at 877-789-ALEX.
[09:14:39.075 --> 09:14:41.097]  That's 877-789-2593.
[09:14:41.717 --> 09:14:48.823]  Now you just saw a report from Dan Badondi from earlier today when he talked to the mayor and the police chief, but we've got an update to that.
[09:14:48.903 --> 09:14:50.665]  Dan was just able to talk to the governor.
[09:14:50.745 --> 09:14:51.825]  We've got Dan on the line right now.
[09:14:51.845 --> 09:14:52.266]  Dan, are you there?
[09:14:54.315 --> 09:14:54.736]  Doing good.
[09:14:54.856 --> 09:14:55.177]  What's up?
[09:14:55.557 --> 09:14:57.000]  I'm like trying to reach back to my car.
[09:14:57.060 --> 09:14:59.164]  I've got like a mile and a half to go here.
[09:15:00.406 --> 09:15:01.327]  So you're out of breath there.
[09:15:01.347 --> 09:15:02.990]  You're running your own marathon today, right?
[09:15:03.471 --> 09:15:04.132]  Oh yeah.
[09:15:04.533 --> 09:15:07.017]  It's called the Liberty Marathon and it's a one mile marathon of two.
[09:15:08.424 --> 09:15:08.624]  Yeah.
[09:15:09.104 --> 09:15:13.205]  Okay, so Dan, you got a chance to get a question to the Governor?
[09:15:13.966 --> 09:15:14.726]  Oh, absolutely.
[09:15:14.806 --> 09:15:18.867]  I mean, I asked him that question earlier, you know, about the drills.
[09:15:19.707 --> 09:15:20.608]  What they have to do with that.
[09:15:20.628 --> 09:15:22.228]  Of course, he said that's a routine.
[09:15:22.248 --> 09:15:25.569]  You know, it's kind of weird that they were doing the same kind of drills.
[09:15:26.049 --> 09:15:28.630]  Just like, you know, the other terror attacks, like 9-11.
[09:15:28.650 --> 09:15:31.971]  They have to be doing drills of the same thing.
[09:15:32.951 --> 09:15:34.793]  And the same thing happened today, as we've seen.
[09:15:35.113 --> 09:15:45.383]  And, um, today, at this time, I asked the Governor and the FBI, why were a lot of speakers telling the people that to stay calm lives before the bomb went off?
[09:15:45.943 --> 09:15:49.746]  And I asked them if this is another state's fourth flag to rob our civil liberties.
[09:15:49.806 --> 09:15:51.248]  And, of course, the Governor just says no.
[09:15:51.668 --> 09:15:53.410]  Then I asked the question again.
[09:15:53.430 --> 09:15:56.813]  I was like, why would people try to pry the bomb going off?
[09:15:57.512 --> 09:16:03.117]  A lot of people told Price that the bomb went off at State Cop, and they avoided the question, walked right off the stage.
[09:16:03.418 --> 09:16:05.700]  The spokeswoman said, that's enough questions, and off they went.
[09:16:07.582 --> 09:16:09.423]  So they shut you up, basically, right?
[09:16:10.144 --> 09:16:16.490]  They shut me up at the end of the press conference right there, and I got the look of death by several APS agents, FBI agents.
[09:16:16.570 --> 09:16:19.313]  I grabbed my camera equipment, and I jetted out of there.
[09:16:20.051 --> 09:16:20.311]  Wow.
[09:16:20.611 --> 09:16:23.232]  Okay, so Dan, about where were you in the question order?
[09:16:23.252 --> 09:16:25.853]  You said they ended the questions immediately after you asked one.
[09:16:25.893 --> 09:16:28.574]  About how far in line were you to get your question in?
[09:16:29.494 --> 09:16:30.835]  Um, there was no particular order.
[09:16:30.875 --> 09:16:32.475]  It's like, basically, you speak up or lose out.
[09:16:32.535 --> 09:16:35.056]  I mean, you use my big mouth, I have.
[09:16:36.877 --> 09:16:38.418]  But, like, I'd basically speak up.
[09:16:38.738 --> 09:16:41.039]  You know, it's a smooth, you lose, so to speak.
[09:16:41.479 --> 09:16:41.979]  That's right.
[09:16:42.719 --> 09:16:43.099]  That's right.
[09:16:43.599 --> 09:16:47.781]  So, uh, about how far had they been going in the press conference before you got a chance to speak?
[09:16:48.702 --> 09:16:51.285]  Um, right after, I think I was the first question, believe it or not.
[09:16:51.305 --> 09:16:51.525]  Really?
[09:16:51.585 --> 09:16:55.388]  Because I knew where, you know, the order of the speakers, as we were told.
[09:16:55.949 --> 09:16:58.731]  And right after that, damn, I had them with the question before anybody else could.
[09:16:59.612 --> 09:17:02.034]  And, you know, of course, you know, just a no.
[09:17:02.574 --> 09:17:06.738]  You know, then after, you know, the first part of the question again, and it was totally avoided.
[09:17:07.179 --> 09:17:08.720]  And I got the look of death by everybody.
[09:17:09.561 --> 09:17:11.042]  So, so let me get this clear.
[09:17:11.142 --> 09:17:15.366]  You were the first question, and then they basically cut it off and then ended the press conference?
[09:17:16.332 --> 09:17:21.177]  No, the first question I asked him was 10, and when the governor said no, he went on with more questions.
[09:17:21.777 --> 09:17:24.360]  That's how I answered my first part of my question.
[09:17:24.860 --> 09:17:29.225]  Why were people told to remain calm moments before the bombs exploded?
[09:17:29.605 --> 09:17:37.693]  Their spokeswoman got up on, they wouldn't say not one word, their spokeswoman got up on the podium or wherever she was, got up on the stage and said the press conference is over.
[09:17:41.266 --> 09:17:45.409]  Okay, so since we last talked to you, have you found out any new information?
[09:17:45.449 --> 09:17:48.932]  Have you found out anything from the runners or anybody else out on the scene?
[09:17:48.952 --> 09:17:52.595]  Yeah, I talked to a lot of the runners and it was probably the same story with everybody.
[09:17:52.715 --> 09:17:53.576]  They either seen it or heard it.
[09:17:53.596 --> 09:18:07.506]  You know, the first explosion, they thought it was like, you know, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big,
[09:18:09.515 --> 09:18:09.775]  Okay.
[09:18:10.115 --> 09:18:16.338]  So, as far as the restricted movement, we heard that the police and military have been blocking off the streets.
[09:18:16.398 --> 09:18:18.499]  Have you seen any increase in that?
[09:18:18.519 --> 09:18:20.320]  Um, yep.
[09:18:20.360 --> 09:18:24.401]  We'll take up the whole perimeter secure and heading out to my car now.
[09:18:24.421 --> 09:18:27.783]  So, probably waiting to see some checkpoints and whatnot.
[09:18:28.943 --> 09:18:35.689]  You know, it's like right now they've got the military police walking around checking little alleyways and cars in the city and everything.
[09:18:36.109 --> 09:18:39.832]  And the governor said that the FBI now has jurisdiction over this.
[09:18:39.972 --> 09:18:44.776]  And the FBI spokesman got on the podium to tell everybody we have jurisdiction.
[09:18:45.196 --> 09:18:47.678]  And for the next few days there's going to be constant surveillance.
[09:18:48.399 --> 09:18:50.681]  And tomorrow's business day is going to be canceled.
[09:18:51.161 --> 09:18:53.763]  So I look for a huge police state in Boston, Massachusetts.
[09:18:55.407 --> 09:19:00.651]  So did you get this recorded on your camera, or have you captured that, or are we depending on feeds?
[09:19:00.671 --> 09:19:02.593]  Yep, I got everything on video.
[09:19:02.633 --> 09:19:11.420]  Great, so we'll get some first-person camera views, because I believe it was Fox News they showed a second ago when you had a chance to ask your question to the police chief.
[09:19:11.440 --> 09:19:15.323]  So we're definitely looking forward to seeing your video of the encounter.
[09:19:15.343 --> 09:19:18.025]  Well, great job there, Dan.
[09:19:20.379 --> 09:19:20.981]  I think so.
[09:19:32.143 --> 09:19:32.743]  Absolutely.
[09:19:57.930 --> 09:20:05.232]  Absolutely, and we've been hearing for the last 12 years that the only way that we're going to be safe is if we give up all of our freedoms and liberties and we shred the Constitution.
[09:20:05.252 --> 09:20:08.353]  Because you know, it's kind of outdated anyway, that whole idea of being free.
[09:20:08.433 --> 09:20:10.014]  And it was like that right away.
[09:20:10.074 --> 09:20:18.196]  I mean, like, any store you went into, any hotel, you had police with assault weapons, you know, the ones that are trying to ban
[09:20:21.378 --> 09:20:22.019]  We're good to go.
[09:20:44.386 --> 09:20:47.850]  Well, here's something for you to ask them, Dan, next time you get a chance to get in the press conference.
[09:20:47.890 --> 09:20:58.981]  They had, whether it was a drill or whether it was a search or whatever they were doing, they had a massive amount of police with bomb-sniffing dogs and everything else there, but they didn't find anything.
[09:20:59.662 --> 09:21:01.644]  Yeah, you might ask them about that.
[09:21:01.764 --> 09:21:04.606]  Well, absolutely, yeah.
[09:21:04.846 --> 09:21:08.849]  If they were doing their job in that drill, they would have found something.
[09:21:08.929 --> 09:21:14.133]  It just shows that possibility could just be another false flag.
[09:21:14.613 --> 09:21:19.457]  And most of all, could you see TSA out the street corners of here in Boston, Massachusetts?
[09:21:20.018 --> 09:21:23.860]  You know, going to a hotel, going to a convenience store just to buy a gallon of milk.
[09:21:24.241 --> 09:21:28.324]  You know, you're getting glipped with Turk style because we're looking for bombs in our trash piles.
[09:21:30.845 --> 09:21:32.647]  Well, we've got a couple of callers here we want to go to.
[09:21:32.667 --> 09:21:33.727]  Thanks, Dan.
[09:21:33.748 --> 09:21:35.029]  You've done a great job up there.
[09:21:35.769 --> 09:21:36.530]  Keep searching around.
[09:21:36.570 --> 09:21:37.771]  We know you'll ferret out something.
[09:21:37.791 --> 09:21:39.252]  Thank you, guys.
[09:21:39.653 --> 09:21:40.193]  All right, take care.
[09:21:40.513 --> 09:21:40.774]  Bye-bye.
[09:21:40.794 --> 09:21:45.318]  All right, so if we're ready for our calls, we'll go to Otter in Mass.
[09:21:46.398 --> 09:21:47.940]  Oh, you cut out for a second there.
[09:21:48.740 --> 09:21:49.200]  How you doing?
[09:21:49.641 --> 09:21:50.101]  Oh, good.
[09:21:50.121 --> 09:21:50.462]  Yourself?
[09:21:50.842 --> 09:21:51.362]  Doing good.
[09:21:51.403 --> 09:21:51.663]  Go ahead.
[09:21:51.723 --> 09:21:51.923]  Alright.
[09:21:52.383 --> 09:21:54.545]  So, a bunch of points to make, real quick.
[09:21:55.727 --> 09:22:06.797]  Did you see the footage, pre-blast, where an elderly gentleman, it appears, at the distance, spasms and crumples to the ground?
[09:22:07.477 --> 09:22:09.339]  I saw somebody falling... Go ahead.
[09:22:10.220 --> 09:22:10.921]  No, go ahead.
[09:22:10.941 --> 09:22:12.682]  I was just saying, I saw somebody fall.
[09:22:12.702 --> 09:22:14.344]  I wasn't exactly sure who it was.
[09:22:15.609 --> 09:22:16.210]  Was he a runner?
[09:22:16.290 --> 09:22:21.096]  It looked like he was a runner and I wasn't sure if that was just before the blast or if it was part of the blast.
[09:22:21.816 --> 09:22:23.759]  You think it was just before the blast is what you're saying?
[09:22:27.290 --> 09:22:34.952]  Hey caller, I'm going to put you on hold real quick.
[09:22:35.553 --> 09:22:36.913]  I'm going to put the caller on hold.
[09:22:37.033 --> 09:22:45.075]  I ran over here from the other side because I've seen the Badandi press conference footage now and they thought it was already over here a while back ago.
[09:22:45.095 --> 09:22:46.296]  This happened like 30 minutes ago.
[09:22:46.316 --> 09:22:49.477]  I wanted to commend Dan Badandi and Full Wars.com reporter.
[09:22:50.197 --> 09:22:55.281]  He took over the press conference with false flag and why were they already running a drill?
[09:22:55.361 --> 09:22:58.963]  And the governor looked completely freaked out.
[09:22:58.983 --> 09:23:00.864]  And they shut the press conference down.
[09:23:00.884 --> 09:23:04.046]  Because I was ignorant about who Duval Patrick was.
[09:23:04.086 --> 09:23:09.030]  I've heard the name, but I was like, who's that black guy who looks totally freaked out and pissed off?
[09:23:09.370 --> 09:23:10.511]  They go, that's the governor.
[09:23:11.131 --> 09:23:15.693]  And he's like totally looking shifty-eyed, and so was everybody else up there.
[09:23:15.833 --> 09:23:20.516]  And he kind of, I noticed, he kind of directs, and then they shut it down.
[09:23:20.556 --> 09:23:25.338]  The governor ordered the press conference shut down over this.
[09:23:25.398 --> 09:23:27.679]  I'm embarrassed to say I didn't really know who the governor of Massachusetts was.
[09:23:27.699 --> 09:23:29.400]  I know who most governors are, but I hadn't kept track of it.
[09:23:29.420 --> 09:23:30.341]  I knew the name.
[09:23:32.402 --> 09:23:32.902]  Let me see that.
[09:23:34.326 --> 09:23:35.767]  Do we have that where we can punch up the video?
[09:23:36.088 --> 09:23:36.748]  Yeah, I'm sorry.
[09:23:37.109 --> 09:23:42.033]  They had the callers faded up in here so I could hear the callers talking, but I don't know if we have it.
[09:23:42.074 --> 09:23:45.357]  I mean, I was just watching it on DVR in the other office.
[09:23:47.964 --> 09:23:51.967]  Listen, online, it's kind of like a crazy game in here to get all the info.
[09:23:52.407 --> 09:23:58.251]  If you go online, I'll guarantee you, on the news channels, they have a recording of the last Governor's press conference.
[09:23:58.532 --> 09:23:59.172]  But it's not a big deal.
[09:23:59.192 --> 09:24:00.173]  You guys are overworked.
[09:24:00.233 --> 09:24:00.913]  It's late at night.
[09:24:00.933 --> 09:24:03.255]  I'm going to let you guys take about 10 more calls.
[09:24:03.675 --> 09:24:05.157]  I'm going to put some bookends on this.
[09:24:05.797 --> 09:24:08.959]  A dude's trying to capture the Badandi footage right now, but it was on CNN.
[09:24:10.140 --> 09:24:11.020]  Yeah, you name it.
[09:24:11.481 --> 09:24:14.962]  We had it on CNN and Fox back there on the monitors.
[09:24:15.662 --> 09:24:21.844]  And it was just the most amazing thing whenever it cuts to Piers Morgan going, well, now that's ending shortly.
[09:24:21.864 --> 09:24:27.706]  On false flag stage at the New York Liberties.
[09:24:27.826 --> 09:24:29.847]  And he didn't answer why that was a drill.
[09:24:30.307 --> 09:24:34.008]  And when this happens in other events, you just hear him going, going, going.
[09:24:34.429 --> 09:24:38.170]  And then they all look like they're on the hot seat and they want it to stop.
[09:24:39.191 --> 09:24:43.456]  He did a great job of planting the InfoWars flag up on the podium there.
[09:24:43.496 --> 09:24:46.480]  You can see it before the press conference.
[09:24:47.321 --> 09:24:49.984]  The point is, imagine if we have thousands of other InfoWarriors.
[09:24:50.305 --> 09:24:52.548]  Folks, just go to these events, just take over.
[09:24:53.228 --> 09:24:55.932]  The New World Order counts on a bunch of sheep, just believe whatever they say.
[09:24:55.952 --> 09:24:57.233]  And look, bottom line,
[09:24:57.714 --> 09:25:00.115]  There's no way Tea Parties would stage an event like this, ever.
[09:25:00.135 --> 09:25:01.915]  I mean, that's just not in their making.
[09:25:02.335 --> 09:25:04.296]  There's no way they could provocateur a domestic group.
[09:25:04.336 --> 09:25:05.016]  They stage other stuff.
[09:25:05.036 --> 09:25:07.837]  There's no way Al-Qaeda is working without U.S.
[09:25:07.897 --> 09:25:08.957]  or globalist authorization.
[09:25:08.998 --> 09:25:10.438]  Our government runs Al-Qaeda worldwide.
[09:25:10.938 --> 09:25:13.179]  This is a staged event, one way or another.
[09:25:13.199 --> 09:25:16.880]  They may have a mentally ill Patsy, as the New York Times reported.
[09:25:17.100 --> 09:25:19.041]  That's the only way it could be quasi-real.
[09:25:19.221 --> 09:25:22.162]  But regardless, keep your hands off my rights.
[09:25:22.482 --> 09:25:24.902]  Don't use this to scare me into submission.
[09:25:25.303 --> 09:25:26.543]  Stick your hands down my pants.
[09:25:26.903 --> 09:25:28.464]  All right, let's go back to you guys.
[09:25:29.164 --> 09:25:30.005]  All right, thanks.
[09:25:30.105 --> 09:25:33.567]  That was Alex Jones, and we'll be back in the other studio with him in a second.
[09:25:33.927 --> 09:25:35.048]  So you heard collars.
[09:25:35.108 --> 09:25:36.829]  Alex wants to get to these calls pretty quick.
[09:25:36.849 --> 09:25:38.650]  So Otter, make your final point, please.
[09:25:39.510 --> 09:25:40.611]  OK.
[09:25:41.812 --> 09:25:43.433]  OK, the dogs, come on.
[09:25:43.613 --> 09:25:45.134]  They're not going to be bomb sniffing dogs.
[09:25:46.408 --> 09:25:47.649]  Bomb sitting right there.
[09:25:48.050 --> 09:25:49.911]  I know people that work in Mass General.
[09:25:50.191 --> 09:25:53.775]  They had friends that were in the tents there at the finish line.
[09:25:54.175 --> 09:25:54.855]  They're okay.
[09:25:55.396 --> 09:25:58.118]  At least that three to six of them that we know of.
[09:25:58.699 --> 09:26:00.641]  And we've been able to talk with them.
[09:26:00.681 --> 09:26:01.621]  We've been able to get through.
[09:26:02.122 --> 09:26:04.003]  The blast was low.
[09:26:04.364 --> 09:26:05.885]  The blast was directional.
[09:26:06.085 --> 09:26:09.568]  It was perpendicular, going straight out across the street.
[09:26:10.209 --> 09:26:11.190]  A lot of smoke.
[09:26:12.871 --> 09:26:19.097]  There's all these keynotes that are specific to the type of blast and what the implement was.
[09:26:20.293 --> 09:26:26.076]  Kind of put money on the fact that it's a anti-personnel mine.
[09:26:26.757 --> 09:26:28.598]  It just goes BAM!
[09:26:28.958 --> 09:26:29.418]  Right out.
[09:26:29.598 --> 09:26:31.340]  And it stays at like waist level.
[09:26:31.360 --> 09:26:32.700]  A lot of people sitting there.
[09:26:33.161 --> 09:26:34.381]  You look at all the injuries.
[09:26:34.421 --> 09:26:35.862]  You look at people with legs blown off.
[09:26:35.882 --> 09:26:38.524]  You look at the people that were sitting and how they were injured.
[09:26:39.124 --> 09:26:40.805]  Three, four feet above the ground.
[09:26:41.005 --> 09:26:43.146]  Maybe as it got across the street it got a little higher.
[09:26:43.707 --> 09:26:45.448]  Not very many windows blown out.
[09:26:45.988 --> 09:27:02.760]  You know, Oklahoma City, of course we know what it really was, but supposedly if it was blown from outside, you're supposed to see some damage on the building behind it, or it's going to be a directional blast because there's a wall, a building behind it.
[09:27:04.161 --> 09:27:06.523]  When you blow something up, it goes all directions.
[09:27:07.564 --> 09:27:09.866]  You know, look at an A-bomb going off.
[09:27:10.066 --> 09:27:11.147]  You know, you've got a donut.
[09:27:12.026 --> 09:27:13.087]  This was not that.
[09:27:13.167 --> 09:27:13.667]  Look at that.
[09:27:13.847 --> 09:27:20.471]  It is the Boston Globe footage, and it is directional, and it is low, and it is specific.
[09:27:20.692 --> 09:27:23.133]  It is a device that you will be able to figure out.
[09:27:23.673 --> 09:27:24.214]  Good point.
[09:27:24.234 --> 09:27:24.934]  Good point.
[09:27:24.954 --> 09:27:26.015]  We'll let it go at that.
[09:27:26.855 --> 09:27:30.798]  We've heard that the mass general bomb was found in the parking garage.
[09:27:31.796 --> 09:27:36.379]  Um, had people there working, that I know, today, in there.
[09:27:37.179 --> 09:27:43.563]  And that they've now confirmed and said to us here that it was in the parking garage.
[09:27:44.223 --> 09:27:47.585]  And we have heard rumor of a third blast in Boston.
[09:27:47.946 --> 09:27:50.367]  Haven't heard anybody talking about that for the last couple hours.
[09:27:50.747 --> 09:27:51.728]  So I don't know about that.
[09:27:52.668 --> 09:27:57.291]  Okay, we'll definitely try to stay on top of that and look at the footage as it develops, but we have to move quick.
[09:27:57.331 --> 09:27:58.712]  Thank you for your call, Otter.
[09:27:59.152 --> 09:28:01.934]  Now we'll go to Harry in Kentucky.
[09:28:03.955 --> 09:28:04.915]  Well, Harry, you're there.
[09:28:06.236 --> 09:28:08.137]  Yeah, thanks David and Jakari.
[09:28:08.297 --> 09:28:09.618]  I've got a question and a concern.
[09:28:09.998 --> 09:28:21.105]  My question is, is the reason this terrorist attack happened is because DHS has made all the preparations and prepared for the next phase of their dark plans?
[09:28:21.906 --> 09:28:27.770]  Well, you always have a group that's going to capitalize on the event, regardless if they were prepared for it or not.
[09:28:28.891 --> 09:28:45.284]  I do believe, regardless if this was a lone attack or if it was something that's orchestrated as a false flag, I do believe that they are ready for it, regardless of whether they were planning for this to happen on this particular day or not, or they were just waiting for, you know, the quote, good crisis to come around.
[09:28:45.324 --> 09:28:49.627]  I definitely believe they're going to capitalize this to push the TSA agenda and such as that.
[09:28:49.807 --> 09:28:51.227]  Yeah, they won't let a crisis go to waste.
[09:28:51.247 --> 09:28:54.548]  I mean, look at what they did with Hurricane Katrina, right?
[09:28:54.768 --> 09:28:58.549]  That was not a government operation, but they used it.
[09:28:59.269 --> 09:29:00.449]  Oh, very well, very well.
[09:29:00.889 --> 09:29:08.810]  And they pushed the agenda of, you need your government to survive, even though they let the people in the Superdome almost dive thirst.
[09:29:09.010 --> 09:29:12.931]  They wouldn't let the water get in and wouldn't let people be self-sufficient.
[09:29:13.211 --> 09:29:14.011]  But we have to jump quick.
[09:29:14.031 --> 09:29:14.891]  Thank you for your call, sir.
[09:29:15.272 --> 09:29:17.652]  We'll move now to Michelle in Wyoming.
[09:29:19.414 --> 09:29:23.677]  I just had a question.
[09:29:23.738 --> 09:29:34.686]  I was wondering if while all our heads are turned focusing on this event, if there's any legislation on the table right now they might be pushing, trying to push through like CISPA or more gun control.
[09:29:34.706 --> 09:29:41.372]  I heard there's a gun control initiative that made it through like the House but needs to go through the Senate and if it does that, will that depend on Obama to veto it?
[09:29:43.280 --> 09:29:53.964]  Well, they need some help to get it through the House because there's a predominantly Republican and the Republicans have much more reliance on gun owners to get elected than the Democrats do.
[09:29:54.064 --> 09:29:57.786]  So certainly this is something that's going to help them because it's going to let them make the case that
[09:29:58.646 --> 09:30:11.173]  It's a scary world out there, and you've got to give up your freedoms, and you've got to let the government protect you, even though they had all these bomb-sniffing dogs there right at the finish line, and a gazillion cameras, and they couldn't see, and they couldn't find this bomb.
[09:30:11.213 --> 09:30:16.156]  They want us to believe that they're going to be able to protect us if we surrender our freedoms to them.
[09:30:16.776 --> 09:30:27.180]  Exactly, and as far as the cameras are concerned, I definitely keep my eye on YouTube and other blog type sites to get alternative views as far as footage is concerned.
[09:30:27.200 --> 09:30:37.263]  But your concern, I'm very much concerned with the same thing you said about them trying to push through some type of legislation, something we may not know about on the surface right now that may come out next week.
[09:30:37.563 --> 09:30:40.044]  Oh, well, you guys are worried about that bombing we did X, Y, and Z.
[09:30:40.484 --> 09:30:47.705]  And there's also all this turmoil in the financial markets on currencies that are set up as competition to the central bank's fiat currencies.
[09:30:48.166 --> 09:30:55.447]  Bitcoin first, then gold and silver in the last, you know, two days or whatever that's been really dropping precipitously.
[09:30:55.527 --> 09:30:58.287]  So both of those things crashing right at this time.
[09:30:58.347 --> 09:30:59.688]  So yeah, it bears watching.
[09:30:59.868 --> 09:31:02.568]  There might be some kind of financial event that's coming down the pike.
[09:31:03.268 --> 09:31:05.409]  We'll go next to Peter in Massachusetts.
[09:31:05.449 --> 09:31:05.929]  Peter, are you there?
[09:31:07.869 --> 09:31:14.751]  One question, why aren't you talking about the JFK library fire and the archives there that may have been damaged, destroyed or lost?
[09:31:15.391 --> 09:31:19.512]  Yes, there was a explosion at the JFK library.
[09:31:19.532 --> 09:31:21.172]  Can you fill us in on some of those details, sir?
[09:31:21.572 --> 09:31:26.053]  Well, I'm just looking at what I've seen on TV and I'm looking at RT's webpage here.
[09:31:26.394 --> 09:31:30.694]  No conclusive evidence linking Boston JFK library fire to Marathon Blast.
[09:31:31.295 --> 09:31:32.395]  But I wonder about that.
[09:31:33.135 --> 09:31:36.937]  And you guys are info warriors, so maybe you can check run this down.
[09:31:36.977 --> 09:31:38.658]  I can read, I can read off the website here.
[09:31:38.678 --> 09:31:45.802]  Please say there is no evidence yet linking the Boston Marathon explosions to a fire at the JFK Library shortly after.
[09:31:46.403 --> 09:31:47.383]  Like minutes after.
[09:31:48.124 --> 09:31:49.524]  Almost at the same time it appears.
[09:31:49.544 --> 09:31:53.006]  Earlier two devices exploded at the event's finish line.
[09:31:53.026 --> 09:31:53.767]  They go on about the
[09:31:54.648 --> 09:31:57.109]  Do you have an article or headline you can direct us to, sir?
[09:32:18.835 --> 09:32:26.640]  RT website, usart.com, usalibrary-blast-police-boston-914.
[09:32:27.301 --> 09:32:34.145]  No conclusive evidence linking Boston JFK Library fire to Marathon Blast.
[09:32:35.610 --> 09:32:55.218]  Well, that's something, you know, we just had, as this all broke, Alex was talking to Richard Belzer, and Richard just wrote a book about the JFK assassination and the aftermath of it, called Hit List, and how many people died, and the astronomical improbability of that many people connected with it dying in that period of time, and so, especially the way that they died.
[09:32:55.278 --> 09:32:59.579]  So, certainly that is something that is suspicious, and I'm sure we'll have Richard Belzer on.
[09:32:59.659 --> 09:33:03.221]  I'm wondering if the Marathon Blasts were a diversion.
[09:33:04.150 --> 09:33:13.895]  Yeah, that's a very interesting thought, and like I said, all this news is new to us today, and as the weeks and days develop, we'll have more time to get into it.
[09:33:13.915 --> 09:33:15.336]  Definitely appreciate your call, sir.
[09:33:15.716 --> 09:33:17.797]  We'll move now to Chris in Michigan.
[09:33:20.759 --> 09:33:21.679]  Or was that Chris in Michigan?
[09:33:22.480 --> 09:33:23.240]  Is this Chris?
[09:33:23.300 --> 09:33:24.421]  Yeah, this is.
[09:33:25.461 --> 09:33:26.182]  Okay, go ahead.
[09:33:28.472 --> 09:33:42.002]  Yeah, Brian Williams today, he was doing a report and asked the police chief, or someone involved in the investigation, why they were told to turn their cell phones off shortly before the blast that happened.
[09:33:42.522 --> 09:33:42.822]  Really?
[09:33:43.403 --> 09:33:46.645]  And yeah, I haven't heard you guys talk about that at all today.
[09:33:46.665 --> 09:33:47.746]  Do you have a source on that?
[09:33:48.867 --> 09:33:51.789]  It would be Brian Williams' news source.
[09:33:52.309 --> 09:33:52.910]  Brian Williams.
[09:33:52.990 --> 09:33:53.250]  Okay.
[09:33:55.620 --> 09:34:06.078]  And, uh, the other thing I had to say is, um, like, back in the 60s and when MLK was, you know, doing his speeches and stuff, everyone was, like, banned together, and I just think people need to do that now, you know?
[09:34:06.098 --> 09:34:08.882]  It doesn't matter if you're black or white or Arab or whatever, like,
[09:34:09.620 --> 09:34:28.431]  We all need to like get together and like I mean Alex Jones is doing the perfect job of making this happen but you know like we need to look at those people that were fighting for civil rights because this is all that this is what that is it's a civil rights movement really at the end of the day to absolutely for justice and for us to not you know have to be groped everywhere we go and
[09:34:29.151 --> 09:34:29.892]  That's right.
[09:34:29.972 --> 09:34:40.499]  I'm surprised during Black History Month no one, you know, combined InfoWars with that movement and like just started a new, you know, spring of action.
[09:34:41.659 --> 09:34:46.683]  Even if you believe the government's official narrative about all this, you accept it whatever it is,
[09:34:47.469 --> 09:34:52.910]  You know, can't people see that this is going to be used to take our civil liberties?
[09:34:53.090 --> 09:34:57.451]  And like you said, it is a civil liberties issue, and I just wish people could broaden this out.
[09:34:57.571 --> 09:35:12.414]  So many times we see people, it seems to me like the two issues on either side of this that are really kind of on the cutting edge of people taking back power at the state level are the gun issue, of course, and also the marijuana legalization issue.
[09:35:12.494 --> 09:35:17.115]  You know, both of those are asserting the division of power between the federal government and the states.
[09:35:17.595 --> 09:35:22.296]  And saying we have a legitimate right to make these determinations at our level.
[09:35:22.876 --> 09:35:25.657]  And they don't have constitutional authority to prohibit these things.
[09:35:25.797 --> 09:35:30.698]  It took a constitutional amendment to prohibit alcohol and they haven't passed one to prohibit marijuana or any of these other things.
[09:35:30.758 --> 09:35:38.820]  But these two groups are so disparate from each other and they cannot, because of their cultural differences, they can't come together and see the broader civil liberties issues.
[09:35:39.480 --> 09:35:55.115]  And occasionally you'll get like the ACLU to come in and they had some issues at the very beginning of this gun registration legislations coming out they had issues with it so but it's very rare that you see that kind of common cause you know both the left and the right
[09:35:55.515 --> 09:35:55.775]  Right.
[09:35:55.795 --> 09:35:56.275]  Absolutely.
[09:36:10.842 --> 09:36:20.106]  And to the caller's other point, we say it all the time, if there's an issue that you like to be, you think should be expressed, don't wait for us to cover it.
[09:36:20.246 --> 09:36:23.407]  If you think XYZ needs to be covered, then cover it yourself.
[09:36:23.427 --> 09:36:25.868]  You can send us an email, we may link to it.
[09:36:28.189 --> 09:36:29.590]  And organize on Prison Planet.
[09:36:29.750 --> 09:36:32.451]  Planet InfoWars, sorry.
[09:36:32.851 --> 09:36:33.671]  Organize there.
[09:36:33.691 --> 09:36:39.894]  People have gotten together groups to fight things at a local level, and it's a great place to start organizing.
[09:36:40.374 --> 09:36:41.614]  Okay, thank you for your call, sir.
[09:36:41.654 --> 09:36:43.435]  We'll move now to Jason in Florida.
[09:36:45.715 --> 09:36:46.055]  Hello.
[09:36:46.075 --> 09:36:46.996]  Hello, Jason.
[09:36:47.716 --> 09:36:49.696]  Hello, this is Jason from A Grave for Jason.
[09:36:49.736 --> 09:36:52.517]  How are you doing?
[09:36:52.537 --> 09:36:52.777]  Good.
[09:36:52.997 --> 09:36:54.698]  Long-time listener, first-time caller.
[09:36:54.958 --> 09:36:58.659]  I just wanted to get on here and say a few things about this Boston thing today.
[09:37:00.219 --> 09:37:04.120]  First of all, there's two words that keep coming up.
[09:37:04.947 --> 09:37:09.991]  And a lot of these reports that I see, uh, with regards to a box truck.
[09:37:11.112 --> 09:37:20.439]  Now, there was a sign that laid behind the head of the former CIA asset, Jim Jones, that said, those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it.
[09:37:21.704 --> 09:37:30.427]  I seem to remember a box truck being commonly used in the Oklahoma City bombing back nearly 20 years ago.
[09:37:30.467 --> 09:37:34.588]  I think we're approaching the 19th anniversary of that.
[09:37:35.068 --> 09:37:37.609]  Or no, sorry, we're approaching the 18th anniversary of that.
[09:37:37.649 --> 09:37:38.189]  That was 95.
[09:37:39.429 --> 09:37:43.931]  But if you want to see where the pendulum of blame is going to be swinging,
[09:37:45.803 --> 09:37:56.471]  I and the rest of the guys here at Agreeing4Chase all agree that this has definitely got false flag written all over it, and they are definitely going to blame constitutionalist libertarians, etc, etc.
[09:37:57.192 --> 09:38:07.980]  Now, earlier I was listening to another great talk show program, conservative talk show program, where a caller had gotten on and said, well, Eric Holder's already calling this a terrorist attack.
[09:38:10.442 --> 09:38:21.856]  I just thought it was surprising because it wasn't very long after the planes hit the buildings in an obvious terrorist attack by criminal elements within our government.
[09:38:23.164 --> 09:38:28.910]  Uh, to call it an act of terror by a foreign, or by an outside source, correct?
[09:38:29.311 --> 09:38:43.365]  Well... Why should this guy be surprised, you know, that Eric Holder, even after a few hours, even though he is very, very much a criminal and we know that they should all be brought up on war crimes,
[09:38:44.804 --> 09:38:49.251]  But I don't think it was that soon afterwards that they called it a terrorist attack.
[09:38:49.752 --> 09:38:57.523]  Like I said, I'm just seeing, I'm seeing, I'm a listener, I love the show, and I see box truck, I see all these other things.
[09:38:58.914 --> 09:38:59.835]  Well, thanks for calling.
[09:39:00.255 --> 09:39:00.875]  Yeah, you're right.
[09:39:01.175 --> 09:39:06.258]  They are going to blame it because they already are blaming it on so-called right-wing terrorists.
[09:39:06.299 --> 09:39:11.262]  We've already heard Peter Bergen, and he'd been working on this narrative we talked about earlier.
[09:39:11.702 --> 09:39:22.068]  On April the 4th, he published an article on CNN talking about how we don't need to worry about Islamists, we need to worry about right-wing domestic home terrorists.
[09:39:22.248 --> 09:39:28.152]  And he was talking about the number of incidents, and there was a minuscule number of incidents for both
[09:39:29.193 --> 09:39:30.054]  I don't know.
[09:39:47.034 --> 09:39:51.477]  What do those groups have to gain from bombing the Boston Marathon?
[09:39:51.557 --> 09:39:52.677]  Why would that be a target?
[09:39:52.717 --> 09:39:54.238]  How could that possibly be a target?
[09:40:07.788 --> 09:40:17.496]  Shea, I've been to Israel, I've taken their anti-terror courses, and the difference is they have the good of the whole, like Spock or something, and here, our liberties trump everything, and that's the problem.
[09:40:17.936 --> 09:40:18.117]  Right.
[09:40:18.217 --> 09:40:19.978]  I mean, this is like one minute ago.
[09:40:19.998 --> 09:40:22.880]  I mean, statistically,
[09:40:24.008 --> 09:40:25.870]  Three hundred, four hundred thousand die in car wrecks.
[09:40:25.890 --> 09:40:27.873]  Hundreds of thousands from flesh-eating bacteria.
[09:40:28.053 --> 09:40:28.814]  All this stuff.
[09:40:29.134 --> 09:40:32.919]  This is just, the total hyping of this is ridiculous.
[09:40:32.939 --> 09:40:37.304]  I mean, do they go show when a predator drone kills a hundred villagers to get one quote bad guy?
[09:40:37.324 --> 09:40:37.645]  No.
[09:40:37.685 --> 09:40:40.028]  They show little kids with their arms and legs blown off?
[09:40:40.108 --> 09:40:40.568]  No, they don't.
[09:40:41.289 --> 09:40:43.210]  They do everything they can to block that off the news.
[09:40:43.931 --> 09:40:45.512]  And this is just pure exploitation.
[09:40:45.712 --> 09:40:50.996]  Whether they staged it or not, and I think they did, they are just squeezing every drop of blood out of this thing.
[09:40:51.456 --> 09:40:52.237]  And it's disgusting.
[09:40:52.257 --> 09:40:53.978]  But go ahead and take seven or eight more calls.
[09:40:53.998 --> 09:40:54.439]  Great job.
[09:40:54.479 --> 09:40:55.099]  Make your points.
[09:40:55.640 --> 09:40:58.402]  And then, well, you know, we heard ten minutes.
[09:40:58.422 --> 09:41:02.865]  I'll go on for about ten minutes of final comments on this special live transmission.
[09:41:03.325 --> 09:41:06.387]  It's 8.41 and five seconds Central Standard Time.
[09:41:06.447 --> 09:41:08.349]  And David Knight, Jakari Jackson, please continue.
[09:41:08.817 --> 09:41:12.507]  We heard for the longest time that the Muslims hate us because of our freedoms.
[09:41:12.788 --> 09:41:13.129]  Yeah.
[09:41:13.209 --> 09:41:16.357]  And now we're being told that our freedoms are the cause of our danger.
[09:41:17.031 --> 09:41:17.811]  That's exactly right.
[09:41:17.871 --> 09:41:18.752]  It's always something.
[09:41:18.812 --> 09:41:20.493]  It's always the boogeyman.
[09:41:20.793 --> 09:41:22.514]  Like last year, it was Coney.
[09:41:23.214 --> 09:41:27.896]  Some guy who people speculate has been dead for six plus years is enslaving the children.
[09:41:27.937 --> 09:41:30.838]  When I was growing up, you used to always hear people say, oh, do what you want.
[09:41:30.858 --> 09:41:31.798]  It's a free country type thing.
[09:41:31.838 --> 09:41:33.219]  You don't hear people saying that anymore.
[09:41:33.379 --> 09:41:35.200]  No, it's like, do what you want and go to jail.
[09:41:35.360 --> 09:41:38.162]  Yeah, you hear people saying, there ought to be a law.
[09:41:38.682 --> 09:41:42.304]  And we used to live in a much, much freer country.
[09:41:42.904 --> 09:41:43.845]  And it was a much safer country.
[09:41:43.865 --> 09:41:45.787]  Why don't we just pass a law against heart attacks?
[09:41:46.328 --> 09:41:47.609]  Or lightning striking you?
[09:41:47.829 --> 09:41:48.950]  Well the answer is they are.
[09:41:48.990 --> 09:41:50.011]  We're going to tell you what to eat!
[09:41:50.802 --> 09:41:52.062]  I mean, it's just there's no end to this.
[09:41:52.122 --> 09:41:52.562]  I'm sorry.
[09:41:52.622 --> 09:41:53.623]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[09:41:53.983 --> 09:42:02.105]  And yet, we saw that even with all the King's horses and all the King's men and all the King's bomb-sniffing dogs, they couldn't find the bomb on the finish line.
[09:42:02.445 --> 09:42:06.106]  With all the photography there that was there and all the people that were at the finish line.
[09:42:06.126 --> 09:42:14.648]  I mean, there's nowhere else along the route where you're going to have the biggest concentration of press, of cameras, of police, of spectators than at the finish line.
[09:42:14.828 --> 09:42:15.208]  Exactly.
[09:42:15.248 --> 09:42:16.108]  Nobody saw anything.
[09:42:16.508 --> 09:42:19.549]  And they're not going to be able to protect you if you give up your freedoms.
[09:42:20.609 --> 09:42:21.269]  And we'll move on.
[09:42:21.309 --> 09:42:24.151]  Was that Ryan in California or is our next one Ryan in California?
[09:42:24.291 --> 09:42:25.171]  That was Ryan in California.
[09:42:25.191 --> 09:42:26.052]  I think our next one is Mark.
[09:42:26.072 --> 09:42:28.313]  We'll move on to who?
[09:42:30.174 --> 09:42:30.614]  Ryan, okay.
[09:42:30.634 --> 09:42:30.814]  Ryan.
[09:42:31.195 --> 09:42:31.335]  Okay.
[09:42:31.375 --> 09:42:33.996]  Can you hear me, Ryan?
[09:42:34.336 --> 09:42:34.836]  Yeah, go ahead.
[09:42:34.856 --> 09:42:37.258]  Yeah, long time listener.
[09:42:37.718 --> 09:42:46.763]  I just, like you just said, I found very interesting as well the, you know, concentration at the end of the race and
[09:42:48.387 --> 09:43:05.932]  Uh, you know, the hardest place to get into watching the whole marathon is the end, you know, and for this to take place there, you know, and to have the dogs there and, you know, it really strikes, you know, you guys, how can no one see this?
[09:43:06.232 --> 09:43:12.194]  And how could this go on, you know, without anybody seeing it, you know, and, uh, the
[09:43:13.866 --> 09:43:19.648]  400 troops that the news claimed national guard troops that were already there.
[09:43:20.068 --> 09:43:20.969]  You know what I mean?
[09:43:21.129 --> 09:43:30.252]  I don't think that the Boston Marathon constitutes 400 national guard troops to already be stationed in Boston.
[09:43:30.292 --> 09:43:32.472]  I mean, it has all the signs.
[09:43:33.273 --> 09:43:39.275]  And a friend of mine, who is also a longtime listener, had sent me some pictures a few days ago.
[09:43:39.295 --> 09:43:40.235]  I actually have them.
[09:43:40.915 --> 09:43:46.498]  If you, uh, I can email them after I get off the phone, of them performing drills five days ago.
[09:43:46.518 --> 09:43:47.939]  In Boston?
[09:43:48.819 --> 09:43:52.541]  In Boston, in the Esplanade and off of Sturro Drive.
[09:43:54.022 --> 09:43:57.823]  You know, performing some sort of search and destroy drill.
[09:43:59.084 --> 09:44:02.806]  It's, you know, so they were there five days ago, you know.
[09:44:03.226 --> 09:44:04.887]  They've probably been there the whole time.
[09:44:05.507 --> 09:44:21.474]  You know, and it just really has all the signs, and I think that out of all the things that we've seen in the past years that have this, you know, the false flag written all over it, it seems as though this is rather a sloppy job.
[09:44:21.574 --> 09:44:28.717]  I mean, it's really coming to light very, very quickly, and, you know, it's, you know,
[09:44:31.658 --> 09:44:33.779]  Tell you what, can you stay on the line?
[09:44:33.799 --> 09:44:35.460]  We need to go to another caller, but can you stay on the line?
[09:44:35.480 --> 09:44:37.041]  Because we'd like to get that information from you.
[09:44:37.822 --> 09:44:38.062]  Sure.
[09:44:38.382 --> 09:44:39.103]  Alright, great.
[09:44:39.943 --> 09:44:44.046]  Yeah, if it's not a false flag, what we've got here is amazing incompetence.
[09:44:44.486 --> 09:44:44.686]  Right.
[09:44:44.986 --> 09:44:45.567]  I gotta say that.
[09:44:46.067 --> 09:44:47.968]  Okay, the next caller is Garmin in Mississippi.
[09:44:47.988 --> 09:44:50.930]  Hey Garmin, are you there?
[09:44:50.950 --> 09:44:51.250]  Garmin.
[09:44:51.650 --> 09:44:52.271]  Garmin, sorry.
[09:44:53.188 --> 09:44:53.688]  That's fine.
[09:44:54.029 --> 09:44:55.710]  I can't believe I got through to you guys.
[09:44:55.730 --> 09:44:57.291]  It's great.
[09:44:57.591 --> 09:44:59.352]  Great job, by the way, on what y'all are doing.
[09:44:59.572 --> 09:45:00.112]  Thank you.
[09:45:00.152 --> 09:45:11.460]  A friend of mine sent me a Facebook email today, and there was a page that was created this past Saturday on Facebook.
[09:45:11.500 --> 09:45:21.166]  I don't know if you guys know about this or not, but the title of the Facebook page is, Thoughts Go Out to All Involved in the Boston Explosions.
[09:45:21.486 --> 09:45:22.487]  Can you say that one more time?
[09:45:23.598 --> 09:45:28.902]  Thoughts go out to all involved in the Boston explosion.
[09:45:29.002 --> 09:45:30.263]  Can you guys pull that up please?
[09:45:30.303 --> 09:45:36.587]  I've already tried to go to this page and it says that the Facebook page cannot be found.
[09:45:38.308 --> 09:45:47.194]  The person that sent this to me obviously got it from another person but they took a picture of the screen and I have it on my phone as well.
[09:45:47.454 --> 09:45:50.096]  There's only 18 likes and one photo.
[09:45:51.172 --> 09:45:58.076]  On the bottom left-hand side, there's a few names, and I'm not going to give these names out over the air because, obviously, they're personal.
[09:45:58.156 --> 09:46:02.398]  I don't want to put their personal information out over the air.
[09:46:03.839 --> 09:46:07.481]  But, like I say, it was created on Saturday, and to me, this is like Sandy Hook times 10.
[09:46:15.831 --> 09:46:18.574]  Oh, it's going to be, yeah, I think it's going to be much bigger than Sandy Hook.
[09:46:18.694 --> 09:46:20.216]  I mean, look at the nature of this.
[09:46:20.296 --> 09:46:28.244]  This is a different type of terrorist attack than we've seen in the past, and they're going to use it in a very different way to do some very different things than they've done in the past.
[09:46:28.264 --> 09:46:31.547]  Yeah, just like what David was saying, you think about Sandy Hook, you have, uh,
[09:46:32.769 --> 09:46:47.300]  You know, people think of it as a confined incident, but you have something in public that not only concerns children, but people of all ages, people from various countries, as Dan told us, he saw people from Australia, Mexico, you know, all over.
[09:46:47.760 --> 09:46:51.543]  So I do agree, this could definitely be more of an international story.
[09:46:52.444 --> 09:46:52.644]  Yeah.
[09:46:53.124 --> 09:46:59.089]  And if you would stay on the line, if you guys could get his information, producers, so we might be able to get that photo.
[09:47:02.779 --> 09:47:05.302]  Okay, we've got a video from Dan Vodati we're going to throw to you.
[09:47:05.322 --> 09:47:05.942]  Hang on, callers.
[09:47:20.495 --> 09:47:21.055]  Next question.
[09:47:22.556 --> 09:47:25.098]  The medical people are compiling that as we speak.
[09:47:25.318 --> 09:47:27.179]  Main point of focus right now.
[09:47:36.804 --> 09:47:39.767]  We're actually working very closely with the families right now.
[09:47:39.787 --> 09:47:41.589]  We're going through those right now.
[09:47:55.584 --> 09:47:58.486]  We're going to have somebody out there.
[09:47:59.106 --> 09:48:00.647]  Look out for this bald guy.
[09:48:00.747 --> 09:48:01.328]  Oh, there you go.
[09:48:01.348 --> 09:48:02.448]  Here's Morgan to the rescue.
[09:48:16.098 --> 09:48:16.538]  Okay.
[09:48:16.678 --> 09:48:17.399]  Great job, Dan.
[09:48:17.419 --> 09:48:18.059]  Great job, Dan.
[09:48:18.079 --> 09:48:19.340]  I tell you what, he's relentless, isn't he?
[09:48:19.600 --> 09:48:20.021]  He is.
[09:48:20.041 --> 09:48:24.864]  Okay, I think we're about ready to go to Alex, so let's take one or two more calls before we go there.
[09:48:24.884 --> 09:48:27.146]  Let's go to Bill in Indiana.
[09:48:28.086 --> 09:48:29.067]  Hey guys, how's it going?
[09:48:29.527 --> 09:48:30.468]  Very great, how are you doing?
[09:48:31.469 --> 09:48:32.210]  Oh, pretty good.
[09:48:32.710 --> 09:48:35.493]  I've been listening to the day.
[09:48:36.094 --> 09:48:39.537]  I'm really glad you guys stayed on for as long as you have.
[09:48:39.557 --> 09:48:40.218]  I know it's tough.
[09:48:41.319 --> 09:48:49.446]  My question is, has anybody thought about a connection between this stuff going on and the U.N.
[09:48:49.606 --> 09:48:50.487]  Small Arms Treaty?
[09:48:51.428 --> 09:48:56.053]  I know that we, I guess whoever it is, John Kerry,
[09:48:56.749 --> 09:49:08.858]  They decided to, you know, just say, well, I'll run it by the Senate, and I guess the Senate voted on it, and it was a very slim margin, but basically they voted no, 53-46.
[09:49:10.700 --> 09:49:24.070]  And it just seems, you know, when Alex was talking about, you know, somebody said something about liberties trumping, you know, everything, isn't that a UN complaint?
[09:49:24.710 --> 09:49:25.351]  Oh, yeah.
[09:49:26.187 --> 09:49:26.587]  Absolutely.
[09:49:27.568 --> 09:49:33.251]  I mean, I know that there's no way that I can discount an inside job from our own government.
[09:49:33.291 --> 09:49:36.313]  But if there's one thing that I fear more than our own government, it's the U.N.
[09:49:36.914 --> 09:49:51.323]  And I just, you know, that the whole idea is just something to take into consideration that this is, you know, not bullying from our own government, but perhaps bullying from whoever is in charge of all this orchestration from, you know, U.N.
[09:49:51.483 --> 09:49:51.743]  stuff.
[09:49:52.003 --> 09:49:55.965]  Well, and the thing to understand, too, Bill, is that a lot of what goes on in the U.N.
[09:49:56.005 --> 09:49:58.006]  is being directed by people that are in our government.
[09:49:58.066 --> 09:49:59.586]  And basically, they're using the U.N.
[09:49:59.606 --> 09:50:05.329]  to do an end around our Constitution and our guarantees, constitutionally protected guarantees and rights.
[09:50:05.389 --> 09:50:09.391]  So they don't, if they can get, they're going to use whatever means they can.
[09:50:09.411 --> 09:50:13.773]  And one of the things that they've been up to, I think, is a two-pronged, multi-pronged attack.
[09:50:14.093 --> 09:50:14.453]  I think so.
[09:50:33.031 --> 09:50:34.171]  They're going to use us to help them.
[09:50:34.212 --> 09:50:37.392]  They're going to use everything they can to scare people.
[09:50:37.412 --> 09:50:40.073]  You know, we've got people who are afraid and paranoid.
[09:50:40.213 --> 09:50:41.234]  They don't know what's going on.
[09:50:41.274 --> 09:50:42.594]  They want the government to protect them.
[09:50:42.894 --> 09:50:50.396]  And you're going to hear those people get even more shrill when somebody stands up to protect our Second Amendment rights, like Mike Lee or Senator Rand Paul.
[09:50:50.436 --> 09:50:54.058]  You're going to hear them just, you know, come after them with a...
[09:50:56.318 --> 09:50:57.739]  Shrillness that you've never heard before.
[09:50:57.959 --> 09:50:58.340]  Exactly.
[09:50:58.360 --> 09:51:05.304]  And I believe it was Kerry, you mentioned Kerry, I believe it was him who said that foreign exchange students don't want to come here because of our gun laws.
[09:51:06.185 --> 09:51:08.266]  Which I thought was pretty ridiculous.
[09:51:08.286 --> 09:51:19.673]  You know, I'm not sure exactly what students he was referring to, if there's any from any particular country, but I'm pretty sure... They probably realize that education in this country is not a very good value at the college level anymore.
[09:51:19.873 --> 09:51:21.474]  That's more of what I think it was.
[09:51:21.494 --> 09:51:21.955]  That's right.
[09:51:21.975 --> 09:51:23.196]  So we definitely appreciate your call.
[09:51:23.216 --> 09:51:24.597]  I think we're about ready to go to Alex.
[09:51:24.637 --> 09:51:26.018]  Let's take one last call.
[09:51:26.438 --> 09:51:27.239]  Alex in Canada.
[09:51:27.259 --> 09:51:30.662]  Can you hear me Alex?
[09:51:30.962 --> 09:51:31.162]  Yes.
[09:51:31.462 --> 09:51:31.683]  Hi.
[09:51:32.703 --> 09:51:34.825]  There's three things I wanted to talk about.
[09:51:34.905 --> 09:51:41.410]  One, did you guys see the tweet from the Boston Globe saying breaking news, police will have a controlled explosion?
[09:51:41.430 --> 09:51:43.592]  Can you repeat that?
[09:51:43.953 --> 09:51:44.373]  The headline?
[09:51:44.393 --> 09:51:45.574]  A little before the incident?
[09:51:46.454 --> 09:51:53.457]  There was a tweet from the Boston Globe saying police will have a controlled explosion on 600 block on Bolston Street.
[09:51:54.038 --> 09:51:55.778]  Really?
[09:51:55.918 --> 09:51:58.600]  It was about half an hour, hour before the incident.
[09:51:59.120 --> 09:52:03.462]  So I found that really interesting that they were saying there's going to be explosion and then...
[09:52:04.582 --> 09:52:05.383]  It's the explosion.
[09:52:05.763 --> 09:52:08.506]  I also have seen a lot of things come up on social media.
[09:52:08.526 --> 09:52:13.611]  I've been scouring for the last hour since this happened and since I found out about it happening.
[09:52:14.251 --> 09:52:20.057]  The last mile of the race, the finish line, was dedicated to Sandy Hook, the Sandy Hook incident.
[09:52:21.639 --> 09:52:24.922]  So I found it very interesting how they linked the two together.
[09:52:25.811 --> 09:52:30.593]  Also, I saw the Facebook group also as well that the caller earlier talked about.
[09:52:30.913 --> 09:52:35.775]  I tagged Alex Jones on Twitter for all three of these things.
[09:52:36.075 --> 09:52:38.556]  Okay, we'll try to dig those up.
[09:52:39.197 --> 09:52:41.058]  Now, I've got one thing to add to that.
[09:52:41.078 --> 09:52:47.040]  I got a tweet about 515 from my wife, who is as much of an information hound as I am on this stuff, and she's been honest.
[09:52:47.060 --> 09:52:48.921]  She said, the tweets about controlled explosion
[09:52:49.421 --> 09:52:54.002]  We're about a controlled explosion on the unexploded devices that were found, so I don't know if that's true or not.
[09:52:54.302 --> 09:52:57.723]  But it certainly bears some more investigation, see what we can find out about that.
[09:52:57.743 --> 09:53:09.627]  Yeah, and all these things, these tweets, these Facebook pages or whatever else it is, we definitely need our info warriors to screen capture these things and get it to us because these things may not always be there.
[09:53:09.927 --> 09:53:13.588]  Now I'm told we're ready to go to Alex in the other studio to finish out the show.
[09:53:16.309 --> 09:53:16.729]  Alex, you there?
[09:53:23.206 --> 09:53:24.967]  All right, we have Alex there on the screen.
[09:53:26.348 --> 09:53:28.129]  All right, folks, here we are.
[09:53:28.149 --> 09:53:41.037]  It is 8.53 Central Standard Time with InfoWars Nightly News extended live coverage here this evening.
[09:53:41.998 --> 09:53:45.760]  I'm going to wrap this up very, very soon so our limited crew can get some rest before tomorrow.
[09:53:46.801 --> 09:53:50.343]  But this has all the telltale signs of being a staged event.
[09:53:51.854 --> 09:53:58.096]  This has all the tell-tale signs of being a false flag, or at least a provocateur event, a crisis they won't let go to waste.
[09:53:59.837 --> 09:54:08.280]  But if you've seen how many times the military-industrial complex and its foreign owners have provocateur-ed or staged events to take our liberties, it would make your head spin.
[09:54:09.720 --> 09:54:19.504]  And that's why I'm glad that we have been here as real media challenging the official narrative tonight.
[09:54:21.715 --> 09:54:38.733]  That's why I'm glad that we have been here to point out, hey, we have a group that has staged hundreds of false flag terror attacks and thousands of medical experiments, many of them lethal, against foster kids, minorities, veterans, the general public.
[09:54:39.534 --> 09:54:43.076]  And so they have a motive and a history of acting like this.
[09:54:43.577 --> 09:54:45.758]  That's why they're in control, because they're ruthless.
[09:54:46.338 --> 09:54:53.583]  And they love the image of running, screaming, scared crowds, and papa government, mama government, there to protect everybody.
[09:54:53.603 --> 09:54:56.845]  Now, our East Coast reporter, Dan Badandi, who's a real...
[09:54:57.685 --> 09:54:58.025]  I think?
[09:55:15.860 --> 09:55:23.226]  They ended the press conference a few minutes into it, only like two minutes, when O'Reilly and Fox and CNN and MSNBC were all carrying it.
[09:55:23.587 --> 09:55:24.868]  We have TVs all over this office.
[09:55:24.888 --> 09:55:25.648]  It was all on there.
[09:55:26.089 --> 09:55:28.691]  And they ended it because the governor was like freaking out.
[09:55:29.091 --> 09:55:30.753]  They shut this press conference down.
[09:55:31.093 --> 09:55:34.896]  And of course, you notice the governor knows what a false flag is to take our liberties.
[09:55:35.396 --> 09:55:36.437]  He didn't say, what's that?
[09:55:36.858 --> 09:55:38.779]  He went, no, we're not doing this for that.
[09:55:39.740 --> 09:55:41.962]  I mean, this whole thing stinks to high heaven.
[09:55:42.002 --> 09:55:44.043]  And the cops everywhere have been caught.
[09:55:44.975 --> 09:55:48.098]  Attacking their own officers as a pretext to arrest protesters.
[09:55:48.398 --> 09:55:49.779]  This is one step up from that.
[09:55:50.160 --> 09:55:51.321]  Blow a few legs off.
[09:55:52.141 --> 09:55:53.362]  Everybody gets pay raises.
[09:55:53.402 --> 09:55:54.243]  Everybody's heroes.
[09:55:54.944 --> 09:55:57.666]  And it's the oldest trick in the book, and no one wants us to discuss that.
[09:55:58.407 --> 09:55:58.527]  Oh!
[09:55:59.027 --> 09:56:00.208]  It's so preposterous.
[09:56:00.248 --> 09:56:03.911]  Who would ever imagine that somebody would stage something to get power?
[09:56:04.212 --> 09:56:05.273]  Why, that never happens.
[09:56:05.513 --> 09:56:06.354]  Reichstag!
[09:56:07.529 --> 09:56:11.953]  Nero, uh, burning Rome, you know, uh, fiddling.
[09:56:11.973 --> 09:56:18.938]  I mean, there's so many examples of this, so they want us to not talk about something that's a known phenomenon, and who has the motive out there.
[09:56:18.958 --> 09:56:19.979]  So let's go to Dan Badonda.
[09:56:19.999 --> 09:56:20.400]  Here it is.
[09:56:20.840 --> 09:56:31.449]  If you take any questions... Well, sir, I'm wondering, when you speak in front of people in New York and stuff, he comes, when you speak in front of Donald Trump, is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and poor homeland security?
[09:56:31.489 --> 09:56:33.891]  I was thinking of him, Donald, he gets on the streets.
[09:56:33.911 --> 09:56:34.091]  Yeah.
[09:56:34.636 --> 09:56:36.697]  Next question.
[09:56:36.737 --> 09:56:39.739]  The medical people are compiling that as we speak.
[09:56:39.779 --> 09:56:42.941]  Main point of focus right now.
[09:56:42.981 --> 09:56:48.185]  The investigation is in the area that the governor mentioned.
[09:57:04.975 --> 09:57:07.877]  We're actually working very closely with the families right now.
[09:57:08.177 --> 09:57:10.579]  We're going through those right now.
[09:57:10.639 --> 09:57:13.901]  And then you've got the military creeping around.
[09:57:13.921 --> 09:57:15.322]  400 members of the military there.
[09:57:34.268 --> 09:57:36.209]  And of course, didn't keep you safe from it, did it?
[09:57:36.869 --> 09:57:43.591]  And then they're saying, could it be Saudi Arabia, the group our government runs, the group our government lets attack Libya and Syria?
[09:57:44.231 --> 09:58:02.896]  Well, I just want to say again, because they work really hard, and I want everybody to know how hard we're working to get you the truth, our entire group of staff, reporters, IT people, everybody, and you the listeners that spread the word about PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com, we couldn't do any of this.
[09:58:04.025 --> 09:58:06.610]  We couldn't do any of this if it wasn't.
[09:58:08.410 --> 09:58:10.530]  For the support of the viewers like you.
[09:58:11.371 --> 09:58:12.911]  And this is a real operation.
[09:58:12.951 --> 09:58:14.191]  This is teleprompter-free.
[09:58:14.251 --> 09:58:22.053]  We use history as our guide, justice as our north star, and liberty as our destination.
[09:58:22.813 --> 09:58:23.953]  And I have three children.
[09:58:23.973 --> 09:58:24.813]  I have a great wife.
[09:58:25.193 --> 09:58:26.093]  I have a great family.
[09:58:26.614 --> 09:58:31.354]  I'm quite frankly endangering them to do this because I realize there's no future.
[09:58:31.394 --> 09:58:33.635]  There's no shore to land on.
[09:58:34.255 --> 09:58:39.379]  There's no destination if we don't reverse this entire criminal tide in this course.
[09:58:40.220 --> 09:58:46.345]  We can't turn society and the whole world over to the very worst people in our culture and in our world.
[09:58:46.665 --> 09:58:56.212]  And if we act like cowards and grovel for tyranny every time there's an event, there will be people that will supply us with events so they can pose as the drama queens.
[09:58:56.613 --> 09:58:59.275]  We are not the United States of drama queening.
[09:58:59.695 --> 09:59:01.357]  We are the United States of America
[09:59:02.137 --> 09:59:05.139]  And we are the big imperial empire, so everybody wants to seize us.
[09:59:05.859 --> 09:59:09.602]  And the empire is murdering and bombing and slaughtering people en masse everywhere.
[09:59:10.122 --> 09:59:16.526]  It's going to stage a few stimuluses against itself as the pretext to go out against the world.
[09:59:17.627 --> 09:59:18.947]  And a lot of people say, well, so what?
[09:59:18.967 --> 09:59:19.608]  We're an empire.
[09:59:19.648 --> 09:59:20.508]  We get the money from it.
[09:59:20.769 --> 09:59:21.169]  No, we don't.
[09:59:21.529 --> 09:59:22.590]  We pay for the empire.
[09:59:23.050 --> 09:59:24.231]  We don't even get the spoils.
[09:59:24.911 --> 09:59:29.114]  So even if you are a wannabe globalist and a corrupt person, a thief,
[09:59:30.779 --> 09:59:33.041]  You're not part of the winning team if you join the New World Order.
[09:59:33.061 --> 09:59:33.662]  You're a schmuck.
[09:59:34.142 --> 09:59:34.863]  You're a sucker.
[09:59:35.243 --> 09:59:35.844]  You're a dupe.
[09:59:35.884 --> 09:59:38.447]  You're someone lying to themselves that they're part of the power structure.
[09:59:38.967 --> 09:59:40.729]  All right, that's it for this extended.
[09:59:40.769 --> 09:59:42.391]  We did five hours of radio today.
[09:59:42.411 --> 09:59:44.553]  And the other guys did three or four hours.
[09:59:45.013 --> 09:59:46.695]  And then we've done a couple hours here, so I don't know.
[09:59:46.735 --> 09:59:47.275]  How many hours?
[09:59:47.556 --> 09:59:48.216]  From 11 a.m.
[09:59:48.236 --> 09:59:49.538]  to now, how many hours is that?
[09:59:51.038 --> 09:59:55.579]  Ten hours of transmission here for a news crew that would normally run a small town station.
[09:59:56.279 --> 09:59:57.460]  And again, great job to everybody.
[09:59:57.480 --> 10:00:00.020]  We're reaching millions of people, and history's happening.
[10:00:00.040 --> 10:00:03.581]  We don't have to sit by while the globalists provocateur stage events and do this.
[10:00:04.202 --> 10:00:13.844]  And so tomorrow we'll continue with the free video feed, where there's always free audio feeds, for everybody at Infowars.com and PrisonBlooded.com and Infowars.com forward slash listen.
[10:00:14.304 --> 10:00:19.706]  You can also find the free links at TheRealAlexJones on Twitter, so be sure and
[10:00:20.106 --> 10:00:20.706]  Follow us there.
[10:00:21.027 --> 10:00:30.614]  I'm gonna go sleep for a few hours, get up, doing the daytime show tomorrow, then extra coverage, and then I'm doing three hours overnight, coast-to-coast AM, on this subject and others.
[10:00:31.014 --> 10:00:32.415]  So be sure and join us for that.
[10:00:32.875 --> 10:00:38.019]  And without further ado, it's 9 o'clock Central, 10 o'clock Eastern, 8 o'clock Mountain, 7 o'clock Pacific.
[10:00:38.379 --> 10:00:40.881]  We'll know a lot more tomorrow, so join me at 11 a.m.
[10:00:40.901 --> 10:00:45.044]  Central for the kickoff of the official InfoWars Alex Jones Radio Show.
[10:00:45.344 --> 10:00:47.205]  And until then, I'm Alex Jones signing off.
[10:00:47.726 --> 10:00:49.427]  Remember, if you're watching this transmission,
[10:00:49.747 --> 10:00:50.630]  You are the resistance.
[10:00:51.533 --> 10:01:00.716]  The other thing I think I'd say is that if this does turn out to be terrorism, don't immediately jump to conclusions about who's responsible.
[10:01:00.776 --> 10:01:20.943]  There's some... It's more than rumour, it's chatter from within the intelligence services that suggests that it might not be what one's mind perhaps leaps to of Islamic radicals, but that it could be homegrown extremists who, of course, have attacked it in the past within America.
[10:01:21.716 --> 10:01:27.560]  Indeed, one recalls the Oklahoma bomb, of course, which was attributed initially to Islamic terrorists and turned out to be homegrown.
[10:01:28.661 --> 10:01:29.462]  Yes, exactly.
[10:01:29.482 --> 10:01:42.151]  And there's reports that that happened on the... I'm saying reports because I just haven't had time to check it out, but that happened also on Patriot Day, which is today, the first Monday in April.
[10:01:42.491 --> 10:01:44.753]  So that might have a special significance.
[10:01:45.654 --> 10:01:48.376]  And we know that the Homeland Security have
[10:02:03.080 --> 10:02:05.461]  I said that was it for the show, but I hadn't seen that clip.
[10:02:05.521 --> 10:02:06.621]  I saw the article about it.
[10:02:07.421 --> 10:02:14.784]  And again, they're all saying this, and I'm going, they're going to blame us, and then Glenn Beck says I'm bad to say that, along with Media Matters and the White House.
[10:02:14.884 --> 10:02:15.824]  I mean, I just...
[10:02:17.361 --> 10:02:25.627]  I don't know who they're going to end up blaming for it, but I know who the prime suspect is, and who stands to gain, and who has a history of this, and who runs Al-Qaeda worldwide, who's putting Al-Qaeda in Libya and Syria.
[10:02:25.887 --> 10:02:28.829]  All right, that is officially the end of the transmission.
[10:02:29.189 --> 10:02:30.510]  See you back tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[10:02:30.550 --> 10:02:30.870]  Central.
[10:02:30.910 --> 10:02:33.652]  Please pray for us, and for America, and for those that were attacked.
[10:02:33.692 --> 10:02:34.293]  I'll pray for you.
[10:03:50.802 --> 10:03:53.963]  In an emergency situation, would you drink contaminated water?
[10:03:54.383 --> 10:03:58.565]  You could if you had the amazing LifeStraw from mypatriotsupply.com.

[10:04:55.612 --> 10:04:57.796]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[10:05:04.707 --> 10:05:08.830]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[10:05:09.470 --> 10:05:10.291]  You want answers?
[10:05:11.091 --> 10:05:11.952]  Well, so does he.
[10:05:12.632 --> 10:05:16.215]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[10:05:16.815 --> 10:05:20.918]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[10:05:31.089 --> 10:05:35.892]  Well, all Hades is breaking loose in world markets, including gold.
[10:05:35.912 --> 10:05:46.638]  The globalists are on record saying that they have been artificially suppressing the price of precious metals because it competes with their fiat currencies, which they're devaluing.
[10:05:47.419 --> 10:05:55.344]  But in the laws of finance and the laws of economics, gold and silver and other commodities will only go up over time.
[10:05:56.195 --> 10:06:06.785]  The insiders, of course, control the major stock markets and can go up and down and ride the rallies up and then, of course, trigger the declines downward.
[10:06:07.125 --> 10:06:13.371]  And that's all part of the record, from LIBOR and the fixing of interest rates to the Plunge Protection Team.
[10:06:14.400 --> 10:06:18.841]  But I have expected that they could massively drive down gold.
[10:06:19.941 --> 10:06:23.442]  But if you look at a 12-13 year graph, it will only go back up later.
[10:06:23.482 --> 10:06:26.283]  That's why I'm not going to sell any of the gold or silver I have.
[10:06:26.563 --> 10:06:38.126]  And again, I don't have the gold and silver I have as an investment, as something to try to make a bunch of money, even though most of the gold I bought was when it was below $500, silver when it was below $10.
[10:06:41.167 --> 10:06:46.449]  I've taken the capital, extra capital, that's been brought in really since and put it into the news operations.
[10:06:46.529 --> 10:06:51.931]  But I do have an emergency backup nest egg, a little bit of cash, a little bit of gold and silver, a little bit of property.
[10:06:53.812 --> 10:07:02.155]  But personally, if they drove gold down to $1,000 an ounce, or if they drove gold down to $600 an ounce, I'm not going to sell it.
[10:07:02.415 --> 10:07:08.678]  Because that just shows what a totally manipulated society we're in, where they use naked shorting to do this.
[10:07:08.738 --> 10:07:09.218]  And we're going to get
[10:07:09.818 --> 10:07:16.362]  Gerald Cilente, Max Keiser to pop in today or tomorrow with their take on what's happening with this.
[10:07:17.002 --> 10:07:18.203]  And we will continue to track it.
[10:07:18.223 --> 10:07:24.906]  If you go up to DrudgeReport.com, we can punch this up on screen for people who are watching on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[10:07:24.946 --> 10:07:32.590]  They've got a live feed of what's going on there via Bloomberg.
[10:07:33.551 --> 10:07:34.331]  Gold is down 6.91%.
[10:07:38.751 --> 10:07:42.233]  6.91% to $1,380 an ounce.
[10:07:42.693 --> 10:07:44.294]  They're calling this a collapse.
[10:07:44.355 --> 10:07:50.299]  A collapse would be losing half its value is generally what you call a collapse, not 6.91.
[10:07:50.979 --> 10:07:52.660]  But they're trying to create a collapse.
[10:07:53.101 --> 10:07:53.921]  Here's the headlines.
[10:07:53.961 --> 10:07:56.423]  Gold set for worst two-day loss since 1983.
[10:07:59.557 --> 10:08:02.780]  I've got other headlines here where they're calling it a collapse.
[10:08:03.801 --> 10:08:05.963]  So that's the type of stuff that's going on.
[10:08:06.283 --> 10:08:07.984]  Investors bail amid collapse.
[10:08:08.225 --> 10:08:08.845]  There's the headline.
[10:08:09.145 --> 10:08:10.326]  Panic is everywhere.
[10:08:10.687 --> 10:08:12.408]  Worst two-day loss since 1983.
[10:08:13.289 --> 10:08:15.751]  So that's how the media is pushing it, ABC News.
[10:08:16.151 --> 10:08:19.574]  Gold investors exit amid price collapse.
[10:08:20.495 --> 10:08:23.318]  Meanwhile, you'll see Soros badmouth gold.
[10:08:23.358 --> 10:08:24.639]  You'll see other globalists do it.
[10:08:25.339 --> 10:08:27.101]  They just want to be able to drive it down to buy it.
[10:08:28.407 --> 10:08:28.447]  No.
