[00:00:02.677 --> 00:00:07.488]  You're listening to GZN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:14.502 --> 00:00:18.686]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:19.326 --> 00:00:20.127]  You want answers?
[00:00:20.908 --> 00:00:21.808]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.469 --> 00:00:26.092]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.653 --> 00:00:30.716]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:45.137 --> 00:00:56.586]  I'm holding in my hands here articles out of the Washington Post, the New York Post, you name it, with headlines like, Why Reporters Fear Team Obama.
[00:00:58.088 --> 00:01:07.095]  Another headline, New York Reporter, New York Times Reporter, Obama Administration Most Closed Control Freak Administration I've Ever Covered.
[00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:16.675]  And I have another headline here out of the Daily Caller with a direct link to the Archdiocese that's over all chaplains and priests and military service.
[00:01:17.195 --> 00:01:23.259]  Shut down in packs chapel services and they go on to say they've been threatened with arrest.
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.222]  Catholics period if they ministered anyone on the basis.
[00:01:29.282 --> 00:01:34.185]  This is the ultra authoritarianism that we're dealing with.
[00:01:37.444 --> 00:01:41.467]  And I know I already covered this yesterday, or much of this yesterday.
[00:01:41.507 --> 00:01:42.808]  The New York Post article's new.
[00:01:44.008 --> 00:01:47.271]  But I was sitting here looking at this anoptagon.
[00:01:47.871 --> 00:01:49.012]  Look at all this news here.
[00:01:49.832 --> 00:01:51.974]  All of this is vitally important.
[00:01:52.554 --> 00:01:54.895]  There are more than 30 stacks here.
[00:01:55.416 --> 00:01:59.979]  Some stacks more than 20 articles thick of just bombshell info.
[00:02:01.308 --> 00:02:08.452]  Bombshell info, but out of it all, I was sitting here right before the show started and I thought, what is most important of all the stacks?
[00:02:08.492 --> 00:02:09.652]  It's this stack right here.
[00:02:10.233 --> 00:02:19.958]  Because they're calling total tyranny, absolute pure evil, absolute pure manifest, we're in deep trouble.
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:29.103]  Just like, oh yeah, they're arresting people for their speech, and yeah, they're real mean to everybody, and yeah, they're taking all our freedom, but it's liberals, so it's okay.
[00:02:29.823 --> 00:02:33.845]  If Obama is able to get away with what he's getting away with, he might actually try to stay in office.
[00:02:34.305 --> 00:02:36.025]  I don't think that's the case, because he's just a puppet.
[00:02:36.305 --> 00:02:37.386]  But the globalists want
[00:02:38.226 --> 00:02:42.068]  Dictatorial power imbued into the office itself.
[00:02:42.108 --> 00:02:45.730]  So I realized we've got to impeach Obama.
[00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.812]  We've got to bring the Obama administration down.
[00:02:49.112 --> 00:02:53.014]  We've got to prosecute Holder for Fast and Furious and the rest of it.
[00:02:53.275 --> 00:02:55.516]  And the Republican leadership has to be made to do it.
[00:02:55.536 --> 00:02:57.037]  Because they all blackmail each other.
[00:02:57.917 --> 00:03:00.259]  That's why they hate Ted Cruz and Rand Paul.
[00:03:00.279 --> 00:03:01.659]  There are no skeletons in the closet.
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.820]  That's why they hate me.
[00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:03.740]  There's nothing to make up.
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:04.621]  There's nothing to dig up.
[00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:05.622]  There's nothing there.
[00:03:05.682 --> 00:03:06.182]  They've tried.
[00:03:08.058 --> 00:03:15.665]  And that's why they hate Drudge Report and WorldNetDaily and folks like that, because they don't control it.
[00:03:16.426 --> 00:03:20.289]  But the people they do control, they absolutely abuse openly.
[00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:24.673]  And you can tell where they want to take us, not just from their own literature and their own statements.
[00:03:25.534 --> 00:03:29.077]  You can tell where the globalists want to take us from
[00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:37.552]  What they do to captive groups, foster children, poor Appalachian white people, poor southern black folks.
[00:03:38.392 --> 00:03:46.895]  In every case, the technocracy that's been in control of this country, really for a hundred years to a great extent, over the scientific corridors.
[00:03:48.075 --> 00:03:54.957]  And that's the technocratic elite, the technological elite that Eisenhower warned about, that he said controls the military-industrial complex.
[00:03:55.237 --> 00:03:56.577]  They always talk about that quote.
[00:03:56.837 --> 00:03:59.358]  He says the technological elite that run it,
[00:04:00.543 --> 00:04:01.264]  We're good to go.
[00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:23.410]  And I've reverse-engineered the whole thing.
[00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:24.171]  It's not hard.
[00:04:24.211 --> 00:04:25.031]  The whole thing's public.
[00:04:25.051 --> 00:04:26.331]  You just gotta read all their documents.
[00:04:27.171 --> 00:04:30.712]  And now they're pretty much going public with all of it, but dressing it up is trendy.
[00:04:31.632 --> 00:04:38.354]  When they've got a captive group, they torture the living daylights out of the person, and then finally kill them.
[00:04:39.994 --> 00:04:41.095]  Look at the foster kids.
[00:04:41.135 --> 00:04:46.816]  Look at the... I use the syphilis example in Tuskegee and black folks, because that's one of the only mass tests people know about.
[00:04:46.836 --> 00:04:49.617]  There's thousands, but that's one of the big ones that people know about.
[00:04:49.857 --> 00:04:50.717]  So I talk about that.
[00:04:51.667 --> 00:04:57.394]  You've got a new poll out where more people care about Miley Cyrus and the NFL and the government shutdown or a government default.
[00:04:57.674 --> 00:05:00.297]  And that's big news as world markets are rocked as well.
[00:05:00.317 --> 00:05:03.120]  We're going to give you all the financial news straight ahead.
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.862]  This is a very important broadcast.
[00:05:04.882 --> 00:05:07.806]  I mean, I can't believe how insane things are getting.
[00:05:09.673 --> 00:05:20.821]  Cal Bend Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soap that is triple concentrated and made from the highest quality vegetable and coconut oils.

[00:06:09.794 --> 00:06:13.797]  When an emergency happens, you'll be left to fend for yourself and your family.
[00:06:14.097 --> 00:06:19.681]  An outbreak of contagious disease can happen anywhere, and the threat of bioterrorism is always at hand.
[00:06:19.981 --> 00:06:25.385]  Because we're faced with more diseases than ever before, we need a better solution than ever before.
[00:06:25.785 --> 00:06:29.308]  Fortunately, there's a simple, effective way to protect yourself.

[00:07:10.961 --> 00:07:12.082]  We are winning.
[00:07:12.142 --> 00:07:19.367]  Alternative media is challenging and beating mainstream media, and it's imperative for the liberty movement to continue this momentum.
[00:07:19.848 --> 00:07:26.432]  However, independent media cannot win without the support of sponsors and advertisers like Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:07:26.873 --> 00:07:32.237]  For over 26 years, Diamond Gusset has been owned by patriots with products designed for patriots.
[00:07:32.737 --> 00:07:38.241]  When I put on a pair of Diamond Gusset jeans, I enjoy the quality, comfort, durability and style.
[00:07:38.762 --> 00:07:41.584]  Most importantly, my wife really likes them as well.
[00:07:42.084 --> 00:07:49.269]  From the cotton to the last stitch, Diamond Gusset bucks the industry standard by producing a 100% all-American product.
[00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:50.991]  Another reason for my endorsement.

[00:08:19.269 --> 00:08:19.449]  Really?
[00:08:19.489 --> 00:08:25.173]  I thought you wanted to be free and not injected with cancer viruses and the vaccines, little boy.
[00:08:26.714 --> 00:08:30.957]  Ah, but you're an American, so everything's all right.
[00:08:38.641 --> 00:08:44.745]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:08:45.126 --> 00:08:47.127]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:08:49.878 --> 00:08:52.546]  Waging war on corruption!
[00:08:53.629 --> 00:08:56.538]  Crashing to the lies and disinformation!
[00:08:57.762 --> 00:09:01.104]  We're here Monday through Friday, from 11 a.m.
[00:09:01.124 --> 00:09:01.824]  to 2 p.m.
[00:09:01.924 --> 00:09:02.645]  Central!
[00:09:03.465 --> 00:09:09.689]  And then we're back, weeknight, 7 o'clock Central, with InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:09:10.449 --> 00:09:19.534]  And yes, we come to you from deep in the heart of America, right here in Austin, Texas.
[00:09:20.134 --> 00:09:25.998]  And we are an American band, dedicated to liberty and freedom and justice.
[00:09:26.758 --> 00:09:34.483]  And number one, ladies and gentlemen, we are dedicated to the right of self-determination.
[00:09:35.764 --> 00:09:46.392]  We are dedicated to free will and 100% opposed to every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[00:09:48.379 --> 00:09:50.942]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[00:09:50.962 --> 00:09:54.586]  We were here, of course, last night, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:09:54.666 --> 00:09:56.808]  Central Standard Time with the Sunday transmission.
[00:09:57.128 --> 00:09:59.831]  And the battle against the globalists never really ends.
[00:10:00.392 --> 00:10:03.114]  But we are now live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:03.175 --> 00:10:07.859]  We have returned and just kicked off this worldwide transmission.
[00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:09.822]  It is the seventh day.
[00:10:10.442 --> 00:10:23.866]  Already of October 2013, as we hurdle towards 2014, and the open announcement of planetary corporate, anti-human, eugenics-based, neo-feudalistic crony capitalism.
[00:10:25.747 --> 00:10:27.608]  All right, where to begin, my friends?
[00:10:28.188 --> 00:10:28.828]  Where to start?
[00:10:28.848 --> 00:10:37.991]  We're going to get into the huge events happening in the global meltdown in the economy today, and what is happening on that front.
[00:10:39.363 --> 00:10:46.211]  We're going to look at Obama running around fear-mongering, saying that we're going to lose the U.S.
[00:10:46.291 --> 00:10:55.362]  credit rating if this whole Obamacare shutdown continues or if they don't raise the debt ceiling yet again.
[00:10:56.869 --> 00:11:09.993]  We're also going to look at the persecution of the free press in this country and now the persecution of religion or the right to practice spiritualism across the board.
[00:11:10.113 --> 00:11:14.634]  It's really getting to the point where I realize that I've been conditioned to accept all this.
[00:11:15.094 --> 00:11:24.557]  I've become comfortable with the tyranny, not that I accept it or like it, but I've now been living next to it so long that even though it's growing like some tumor,
[00:11:25.655 --> 00:11:26.416]  On my face!
[00:11:27.397 --> 00:11:31.100]  Now I think it's part of my body and don't want to cut it off.
[00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:37.526]  No, ladies and gentlemen, we need to cut it off and go through the pain and deal with it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:38.419 --> 00:11:46.427]  But world markets are tumbling right now and we're going to be going over all of that in great detail.
[00:11:46.467 --> 00:11:51.131]  Here is the Business Insider headline up on Infowars.com.
[00:11:51.532 --> 00:11:53.694]  Markets tumbling all around the world.
[00:11:54.214 --> 00:11:56.016]  Economy set to slow.
[00:11:56.437 --> 00:11:58.218]  Debt ceiling crisis grows.
[00:11:58.979 --> 00:12:18.784]  And how do they hold Brazil and all these other third world countries hostage over and over again since the 50s with IMF and World Bank loans and loan sharking fees and then the money that's loaned to them has to be given to globalist corporations that set up shop in the country as a direct banker payoff or looting to them.
[00:12:19.764 --> 00:12:22.645]  So we're going to be discussing all of that today.
[00:12:22.685 --> 00:12:28.266]  But first I want to get into something that I mentioned yesterday but that is not really getting any attention
[00:12:29.855 --> 00:12:48.411]  In the globalist controlled corporate press, and that is that people are walking across the barriers at national parks, at privately controlled and paid for World War II and Vietnam memorials, and the establishment doesn't really know what to do.
[00:12:48.932 --> 00:12:51.915]  Jokes were made a few days ago last week that they would
[00:12:52.515 --> 00:13:12.324]  I have helicopters hold a white sheet over Mount Rushmore so that you couldn't see the four presidents carved into the face of the mountain there, but now they're actually blocking the roads miles and miles away that they don't even own or control, the news is reporting, so that people can't even get within close distance to see it.
[00:13:13.004 --> 00:13:27.848]  So this just shows the total control freak nature of the government we've got, where they want to dominate you, they hate your freedom, they absolutely hate your individualism, and they want to totally run your life.
[00:13:28.408 --> 00:13:32.969]  That's what New York Times and Washington Post reporters are saying about the Obama administration.
[00:13:33.229 --> 00:13:36.430]  They are the most arrogant, the most hateful, the meanest.
[00:13:37.521 --> 00:13:38.782]  There aren't cameras around.
[00:13:39.142 --> 00:13:43.163]  They don't give even a quarter tip when Obama goes to eat somewhere.
[00:13:43.624 --> 00:13:45.864]  They are completely rude and hateful.
[00:13:46.285 --> 00:13:48.125]  And the entire gaggle of criminals.
[00:13:48.145 --> 00:13:53.988]  You know, when you read about Larry Summers and you read about Al Gore, it comes out they don't give tips.
[00:13:54.428 --> 00:13:55.609]  They're rude to everyone.
[00:13:56.269 --> 00:14:01.171]  They tell people at Bilderberg group meetings and at Davos, don't look at the people in the eyes.
[00:14:01.791 --> 00:14:03.952]  And if they do, they get the person fired.
[00:14:03.972 --> 00:14:05.413]  If a
[00:14:08.624 --> 00:14:12.127]  Janitor or someone bumps into one of these globalists.
[00:14:12.407 --> 00:14:13.428]  They have them fired.
[00:14:13.448 --> 00:14:16.791]  I mean, they are just there to hate on people.
[00:14:17.252 --> 00:14:18.373]  We have empathy.
[00:14:18.513 --> 00:14:19.754]  We care what people think.
[00:14:20.054 --> 00:14:21.696]  We want people to do well.
[00:14:22.336 --> 00:14:29.122]  The average good person enjoys having friends over to their house, barbecuing for them, feeding them, seeing people enjoy themselves.
[00:14:29.142 --> 00:14:32.605]  It's that feeling of community, of family, of kinsmanship.
[00:14:33.266 --> 00:14:34.146]  They're not into that.
[00:14:34.186 --> 00:14:40.469]  They're not like us, and that's why they rule over us, is because we're blind to them and believe their propaganda.
[00:14:41.209 --> 00:14:48.312]  When you study this particular Western elite that we've got, you don't get in the club.
[00:14:48.392 --> 00:14:55.795]  It's like Getty, the famous billionaire, on record had big mansions all over the world, and when family
[00:14:57.403 --> 00:15:08.409]  When family would come to one of his mansions to stay, he had pay phones, and if they wanted to come visit him, they had to pay for maid service or pay for food.
[00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:11.311]  And I've been doing more reading on the Globalist.
[00:15:11.651 --> 00:15:12.752]  They're like that today.
[00:15:13.232 --> 00:15:18.235]  They will try to stiff a restaurant and say, oh, your boss says it's taken care of.
[00:15:18.355 --> 00:15:18.855]  Talk to him.
[00:15:19.295 --> 00:15:22.737]  And then the boss doesn't want to make a rich person who's known in the community mad.
[00:15:23.518 --> 00:15:23.898]  Or they'll
[00:15:26.118 --> 00:15:31.143]  They'll make family, again, when they come to visit, pay for everything.
[00:15:31.163 --> 00:15:38.431]  In fact, I was talking to somebody I know who has a rich uncle that heads up a major top-ten bank.
[00:15:39.531 --> 00:15:40.612]  And he said it's the same thing.
[00:15:41.192 --> 00:15:46.336]  If you go to the house, even though you're invited there, he charges you to stay in the house.
[00:15:46.876 --> 00:15:50.919]  This is, because they can't stand you getting anything.
[00:15:50.999 --> 00:15:56.702]  It's like a hyper-competitiveness on PCP, mixed with steroids, with a rocket tied to it signed in.
[00:15:57.243 --> 00:15:58.584]  I mean, it's just, it's total evil.
[00:16:00.865 --> 00:16:02.567]  And they don't like you having swimming pools.
[00:16:02.767 --> 00:16:04.248]  They don't like you having air conditioning.
[00:16:04.268 --> 00:16:05.609]  They don't like your kids being healthy.
[00:16:06.069 --> 00:16:10.173]  Their pleasure is that they're putting GMO into the crops.
[00:16:10.533 --> 00:16:12.675]  Their pleasure is they're putting fluoride in the water.
[00:16:12.975 --> 00:16:15.778]  Their pleasure is that they're wrecking the society.
[00:16:15.798 --> 00:16:18.240]  Their pleasure is they're promoting ugly art.
[00:16:19.085 --> 00:16:20.387]  And devilish art and death.
[00:16:20.767 --> 00:16:23.731]  Their pleasure is that they're mutating society.
[00:16:23.771 --> 00:16:26.415]  Their pleasure is that they're cutting off their resources.
[00:16:26.675 --> 00:16:30.160]  Their pleasure is that they're indenturing you and your family through debt.
[00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:32.002]  It is their pleasure!
[00:16:33.226 --> 00:16:41.388]  It's Warren Buffett's pleasure, in the first round of bailouts, to get $48 billion of money directly into his company, of taxpayer money.
[00:16:41.808 --> 00:16:45.008]  The first round, he got $40 plus billion.
[00:16:45.188 --> 00:16:54.350]  Do you know how much it is in the last five years that Berkshire Hathaway and his allied companies, last time I saw it, I think it was in Bloomberg, over $400 billion directly to that pig.
[00:16:59.164 --> 00:16:59.304]  I don't
[00:17:19.412 --> 00:17:29.019]  Through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, it says at the end of it, last time I saw it, you can look it up, they financed the Guardian, they financed the New York Times, you know most of that news is paid for now.
[00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:35.824]  And of course it's paid for with your tax money given to that fat pig, that degenerate piece of garbage.
[00:17:36.064 --> 00:17:37.125]  I use him as an example.
[00:17:37.805 --> 00:17:45.991]  Who sits up there, and reportedly, again, stiffs people on tips, doesn't pay his bills, that's come out in the news, pushes people around,
[00:17:48.783 --> 00:17:54.088]  You know, leaves his mama in some disgusting nursing home, I've been told by high-level people.
[00:17:55.109 --> 00:17:57.571]  Won't even take care of his mama!
[00:18:00.753 --> 00:18:06.679]  And then he gets the taxes raised on poor people, telling the poor people, hey, we're gonna get the rich people.
[00:18:08.083 --> 00:18:09.904]  That's what that ABC this week always says.
[00:18:09.964 --> 00:18:14.428]  Every week the show that I've seen it is, oh, we've got to raise taxes on the rich.
[00:18:14.448 --> 00:18:15.969]  They're getting away with no taxes.
[00:18:16.429 --> 00:18:18.691]  Oh, my secretary pays a higher percentage than I do.
[00:18:18.971 --> 00:18:25.737]  Meanwhile, he helped write the laws in the 80s and 90s on record to exempt his degenerate slimeball self.
[00:18:26.573 --> 00:18:29.016]  I said I've got all this news and I haven't even gotten into any of it yet.
[00:18:29.577 --> 00:18:38.267]  It just makes me so upset that they are strangling this country with a spirit of pure evil and hatred and bad will towards man.
[00:18:38.808 --> 00:18:39.469]  I have good will.
[00:18:41.151 --> 00:18:43.514]  I want the life extensions for the general public.
[00:18:44.648 --> 00:18:47.430]  I want to have uplifting art and culture to uplift humanity.
[00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:50.092]  They have dumbed humanity down on record, on purpose.
[00:18:50.352 --> 00:18:57.798]  And now, yes, the general public are howling, stupid, demonic, moronic, evil, dangerous, vicious, pig-like creatures.
[00:18:58.579 --> 00:19:08.786]  Totally dumb, into being dumb, into being selfish, into being fake manly, or women, into being tardish, and self-centered, and not caring about anybody.
[00:19:09.106 --> 00:19:11.168]  But it doesn't matter, folks, because that's humanity.
[00:19:11.208 --> 00:19:12.089]  We've got to save them.
[00:19:13.959 --> 00:19:18.448]  They are light years better than the actual controllers that are trying to make them like they are.
[00:19:18.809 --> 00:19:20.271]  Because it makes them more easy to control.
[00:19:22.815 --> 00:19:38.889]  And just seeing the desolation of humanity and our psyche and our spirit, seeing humanity being drugged through every snake pit, every festering pit of degeneracy, and it makes me want to throw up.
[00:19:39.609 --> 00:19:46.094]  And the persecution of the children, and the system trying to defile them and wreck their minds and corrupt them.
[00:19:46.875 --> 00:20:01.429]  It's time for men of honor to stop being servile, limp-wristed cowards, and it's time for you to realize that good is actually strong, good is scary to the tyrants, and that you need to stand against these people and become very aggressive against them.
[00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:04.492]  Stop caring what the enemy thinks about us.
[00:20:04.512 --> 00:20:06.334]  They are buckets of slime.
[00:20:06.374 --> 00:20:08.176]  They are the lowest form of garbage.
[00:20:09.855 --> 00:20:10.896]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:20:10.976 --> 00:20:15.299]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:20:15.459 --> 00:20:21.064]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:20:21.184 --> 00:20:23.286]  Gold has outperformed paper investments yet.
[00:20:23.346 --> 00:20:24.527]  No word about IRAs.

[00:23:31.702 --> 00:23:32.903]  Things are so much better now.
[00:23:33.303 --> 00:23:35.564]  Everything kinda came back overnight.
[00:23:35.724 --> 00:23:38.146]  My girlfriend is very happy.

[00:24:20.097 --> 00:24:24.261]  Alright, we're back live folks.
[00:24:24.301 --> 00:24:25.542]  Let me get into the news here.
[00:24:25.562 --> 00:24:30.246]  I start ranting about the nature of the globalists.
[00:24:32.007 --> 00:24:38.573]  I start thinking about how nasty they are and how their religion is lying to the public.
[00:24:38.593 --> 00:24:46.759]  I saw a commercial on selling financial instruments on CNN just a minute ago and I was back in the kitchen.
[00:24:47.774 --> 00:24:51.397]  And the person was talking to everyone like they were two years old.
[00:24:52.698 --> 00:25:01.744]  Going, we are the number one company that are experts at doing this.
[00:25:03.585 --> 00:25:04.706]  And it's a feedback loop.
[00:25:04.726 --> 00:25:07.668]  You start dumbing people down like that and dumbing the culture down.
[00:25:08.929 --> 00:25:15.514]  Pretty soon, it actually creates a culture where people are mindless jellyfish.
[00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:19.581]  And that's the system the globalists are going to, but I've already talked about that.
[00:25:20.461 --> 00:25:30.944]  Historically, the press in this country would have covered the man who set himself on fire at the National Mall.
[00:25:31.664 --> 00:25:33.404]  Here's the headline from the Associated Press.
[00:25:33.904 --> 00:25:39.826]  It says he may have been protesting, but other than this AP article,
[00:25:40.868 --> 00:25:44.211]  That I saw carried in an Alabama newspaper.
[00:25:44.611 --> 00:25:46.052]  I'm seeing almost no coverage.
[00:25:47.333 --> 00:26:01.844]  Witnesses who saw as a still unidentified man set himself on fire report hearing him say something about voting rights and turning to salute the Capitol.
[00:26:03.097 --> 00:26:09.720]  The Washington Post reports the man gave a military-style salute before dousing himself in gasoline around 4.25 p.m.
[00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:10.641]  local time Friday.
[00:26:11.101 --> 00:26:12.382]  He died around 9 p.m.
[00:26:12.402 --> 00:26:14.843]  that night, according to the Metropolitan Police Department spokesman.
[00:26:16.621 --> 00:26:21.964]  Surprised they didn't call the police heroes or something for roasting weenies and marshmallows on him.
[00:26:22.645 --> 00:26:23.866]  I mean, I'm not even trying to joke.
[00:26:23.906 --> 00:26:27.668]  They call themselves heroes for killing that woman.
[00:26:27.988 --> 00:26:36.374]  And now the family, including a retired New York detective, police detective, are going public saying the official story isn't true.
[00:26:36.474 --> 00:26:38.155]  She didn't ram the White House barricade.
[00:26:38.635 --> 00:26:39.976]  It was the cops that rammed it.
[00:26:40.296 --> 00:26:41.777]  She didn't shoot at him with guns.
[00:26:41.797 --> 00:26:42.718]  We already know all that.
[00:26:43.766 --> 00:26:47.368]  We already know it was all a lie, and now the family is speaking out about that.
[00:26:47.788 --> 00:26:50.750]  She got scared, ran off from an Army Marine Corps checkpoint.
[00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:52.270]  They were having drills in the area.
[00:26:52.511 --> 00:26:55.432]  The news admitted it was a temporary checkpoint.
[00:26:56.733 --> 00:26:57.393]  Got scared.
[00:26:58.934 --> 00:27:00.215]  Had postpartum depression.
[00:27:00.235 --> 00:27:02.075]  They reportedly put her on a bunch of psychotropics.
[00:27:02.356 --> 00:27:04.397]  That causes fight or flight to be jacked up.
[00:27:05.277 --> 00:27:07.698]  And she ran off, and she got scared.
[00:27:07.718 --> 00:27:08.659]  People pointing guns at her.
[00:27:10.796 --> 00:27:22.782]  Of course, if you study criminology and just basic psychology, statistically, women will either grovel, attack you, or run.
[00:27:22.802 --> 00:27:25.624]  And of course, men will either grovel, attack you, or run.
[00:27:27.625 --> 00:27:32.547]  But statistically, women tend to run as their mechanism more than men.
[00:27:32.647 --> 00:27:33.468]  Men tend to just
[00:27:34.355 --> 00:27:34.755]  Lay there.
[00:27:35.396 --> 00:27:39.661]  In the modern society, the modern culture, men see a gun pointed at them, they shut down.
[00:27:39.981 --> 00:27:48.710]  And a lot of women do too, but statistically, if you can look this up, I've seen the studies over the years, women will run more than men, especially if they have a child with them.
[00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:49.571]  They'll just take off.
[00:27:50.392 --> 00:27:51.092]  They'll just bolt.
[00:27:51.393 --> 00:27:54.115]  Now when a deer sees you and gets scared and bolts, it's okay.
[00:27:54.876 --> 00:27:56.438]  But when a woman does it, you kill her.
[00:27:58.567 --> 00:28:04.890]  And the cops were so hysterical, I've already talked about this, they're just randomly driving around down the middle of the street ramming into barriers.
[00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:07.312]  It's not like they were going around a turn and ramming barriers.
[00:28:07.332 --> 00:28:12.034]  They were just driving straight into barriers, just like, I'm just gonna run my car into a barrier.
[00:28:12.054 --> 00:28:16.957]  And reportedly there were a bunch of crash-ups with police just driving like total psychopaths.
[00:28:18.137 --> 00:28:19.338]  They were endangering the public.
[00:28:20.178 --> 00:28:22.179]  Should the public have gone after them?
[00:28:22.239 --> 00:28:23.100]  No, obviously not.
[00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:26.682]  But it is some type of mental illness, mass mental illness.
[00:28:27.745 --> 00:28:32.186]  And you're going to see more and more craziness, but so many revolutions have started with self-immolation.
[00:28:33.766 --> 00:28:41.128]  More people will go to a high rooftop and jump off at a public event to make a point.
[00:28:42.108 --> 00:28:47.530]  And it is an exclamation point that we see a lot of times when revolutions start, but I thought that we would talk about it.
[00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:52.071]  A man who died after setting himself on fire at the National Mall may have been protesting.
[00:28:52.771 --> 00:28:54.331]  Really, you think he may have been protesting?
[00:28:55.832 --> 00:28:56.532]  And we still don't.
[00:28:59.212 --> 00:29:00.152]  Still don't know exactly what happened.
[00:29:00.172 --> 00:29:03.474]  There were five gentlemen hitting him with their t-shirts.
[00:29:03.554 --> 00:29:07.296]  Witnesses said when he fell over, his arms were all white.
[00:29:07.856 --> 00:29:09.317]  He was burned really bad.
[00:29:10.277 --> 00:29:17.220]  Yeah, it looks like, and I know you'd be charred from fire as well, but it looks like he was a black man.
[00:29:17.881 --> 00:29:18.741]  Not from the fire.
[00:29:19.261 --> 00:29:20.922]  In fact, I'm predicting he is a black guy.
[00:29:20.962 --> 00:29:21.822]  It's not from the fire.
[00:29:22.102 --> 00:29:23.623]  Because the area where he's burned is white.
[00:29:23.683 --> 00:29:27.405]  It's burned his top three layers of skin off, down to the meat.
[00:29:28.997 --> 00:29:32.198]  And he looks like a big guy.
[00:29:32.218 --> 00:29:33.118]  Probably.
[00:29:33.138 --> 00:29:34.599]  He looks like he's about 45 years old.
[00:29:34.619 --> 00:29:35.619]  Probably a military veteran.
[00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:39.761]  Just looking at his body structure and the way he looks.
[00:29:39.801 --> 00:29:41.381]  We'll see if I'm accurate when it comes out.
[00:29:41.942 --> 00:29:46.263]  I'm saying he's a 45-year-old Army veteran probably.
[00:29:48.484 --> 00:29:51.525]  Who set himself on fire because the military isn't allowed to vote.
[00:29:52.365 --> 00:29:53.706]  They're saying that's what some of what was said.
[00:29:53.746 --> 00:29:54.686]  It was about voting rights.
[00:29:54.706 --> 00:29:55.166]  But we'll see.
[00:29:55.486 --> 00:29:56.326]  We'll see what comes out.
[00:29:56.767 --> 00:29:57.507]  God rest his soul.
[00:29:59.093 --> 00:30:02.077]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.

[00:32:10.049 --> 00:32:13.733]  Research shows that the next Great Depression is inevitable and unstoppable.
[00:32:13.993 --> 00:32:15.795]  It is suicide to not be prepared.
[00:32:16.175 --> 00:32:21.080]  Some reviews are already saying that Locusts on the Horizon is one of the best prepper books ever written.
[00:32:21.601 --> 00:32:25.605]  It provides over 1,100 pages for the full spectrum of vital prepper knowledge.
[00:32:25.965 --> 00:32:32.052]  It is encyclopedic in scope and size on how to prepare for the next Great Depression or a whole host of other looming threats.

[00:32:55.249 --> 00:32:56.190]  Time is running out.
[00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:57.851]  The time to prepare is now.
[00:32:57.991 --> 00:33:01.694]  Your copy of Locusts on the Horizon is available immediately on Amazon.
[00:33:01.974 --> 00:33:04.616]  Or you can go to locustsonthehorizon.com.

[00:33:20.826 --> 00:33:28.551]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:38.601 --> 00:33:54.226]  Alright, I'm going to try to discipline myself and actually go through what's happening in the world financial markets, then the unprecedented attack on the press and the free society period that has really reached proportions that are staggering.
[00:33:54.866 --> 00:34:03.428]  And if the government gets away with this, the next level we'll be arresting people who criticize the government en masse and then a civil war is going to start.
[00:34:03.448 --> 00:34:05.689]  Because everybody's not just going to go to your FEMA camp.
[00:34:06.653 --> 00:34:09.996]  You're Bolshevik-run sinner just because you say our free speech is illegal.
[00:34:10.016 --> 00:34:23.307]  I mean, they're now telling Catholic priests, Methodist priests, it doesn't matter, across the board, they're now telling them you will be arrested and only the Catholic Diocese is complaining.
[00:34:24.888 --> 00:34:25.269]  If they
[00:34:26.752 --> 00:34:29.655]  Give communion, if they pray with someone, if they visit with someone.
[00:34:29.975 --> 00:34:33.418]  What do you think a priest or a preacher that does their job is really doing?
[00:34:33.578 --> 00:34:42.086]  They're going to people's houses when the father dies, or the mother dies, or the kid's in a car wreck, or when somebody's sick, or when somebody's in the hospital.
[00:34:44.847 --> 00:34:46.008]  I mean, it's amazing.
[00:34:46.348 --> 00:34:51.731]  And it goes on to say, if you volunteer your time, you're going to be arrested and court-martialed.
[00:34:52.291 --> 00:34:59.795]  I mean, this really shows just how evil the Obama people are.
[00:35:00.175 --> 00:35:01.556]  And it is the Obama people.
[00:35:01.576 --> 00:35:04.878]  The Republicans are sold out, dismantling the country.
[00:35:05.258 --> 00:35:06.939]  They've been going after our guns at the top.
[00:35:07.439 --> 00:35:10.260]  They're trying to shut down the good Tea Party Republicans and Libertarians.
[00:35:10.721 --> 00:35:13.162]  But compared to Obama, I'm even shocked
[00:35:14.363 --> 00:35:16.085]  Then I guess they're getting away with it.
[00:35:18.488 --> 00:35:27.638]  Going after pro-life groups, going after adoption groups, going after Christian groups, going after mainline Christian organizations.
[00:35:29.591 --> 00:35:33.613]  And telling them, you can't be 501c3 and be anti-abortion, that's political.
[00:35:34.313 --> 00:35:41.276]  When, folks, just so you know, Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religious abbreviation for exercise thereof.
[00:35:41.616 --> 00:35:46.458]  But even if you're a, quote, religious charity, you have the free speech to be against abortion.
[00:35:46.658 --> 00:35:47.999]  They're just telling you you don't.
[00:35:48.179 --> 00:35:51.701]  And the courts have ruled that, common sense says that, but they don't care.
[00:35:51.761 --> 00:35:57.203]  They're lawless crooks, shutting down churches with the IRS, and we just sit here and take it!
[00:35:59.793 --> 00:36:03.815]  And I'm sure the IRS people are listening, going, you're endangering us, calling us lawless crooks.
[00:36:04.095 --> 00:36:05.355]  You are lawless crooks!
[00:36:05.615 --> 00:36:06.876]  You are abusing people!
[00:36:07.116 --> 00:36:08.577]  You are persecuting people!
[00:36:08.817 --> 00:36:09.997]  You are hurting people!
[00:36:10.197 --> 00:36:11.998]  You are classical authoritarians!
[00:36:12.839 --> 00:36:21.942]  I can't believe you're getting away with it, and it's getting worse, and now they're telling Christians, you can't pray in your own private time.
[00:36:22.042 --> 00:36:24.423]  I have the Archdiocese press release.
[00:36:25.444 --> 00:36:27.945]  They have been told, you will be arrested.
[00:36:29.411 --> 00:36:34.033]  They told citizens, you walk on this memorial that the feds don't even own, we'll arrest you!
[00:36:34.714 --> 00:36:35.954]  They're going out of their way!
[00:36:36.214 --> 00:36:37.175]  And it's so low!
[00:36:37.495 --> 00:36:38.496]  And it's so corrupt!
[00:36:38.776 --> 00:36:40.717]  And for those of us, we're like, this makes them look bad!
[00:36:40.777 --> 00:36:41.437]  They don't care!
[00:36:41.657 --> 00:36:42.478]  They're in charge!
[00:36:42.698 --> 00:36:46.080]  They want you to know that they're dirty and nasty and bad!
[00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:48.281]  They've been training to kill us!
[00:36:50.002 --> 00:36:52.563]  The army has taught George Washington is bad!
[00:36:52.823 --> 00:36:53.844]  The founder of the U.S.
[00:36:53.944 --> 00:36:54.164]  Army!
[00:36:55.719 --> 00:36:57.160]  That's government documents!
[00:36:57.721 --> 00:36:58.241]  Public!
[00:36:58.481 --> 00:37:02.625]  They're proud of them saying the Founders are bad and wouldn't be welcome in today's military.
[00:37:04.426 --> 00:37:11.412]  I just cannot state to you enough that I sit here and I say all this and I realize it's worse than I'm even saying.
[00:37:11.432 --> 00:37:12.533]  There's not words to describe it.
[00:37:13.193 --> 00:37:15.375]  And it's really worse than I can even describe.
[00:37:15.455 --> 00:37:22.721]  I cannot believe how evil and consciously bad these people are.
[00:37:22.821 --> 00:37:23.561]  I said I'd get into this.
[00:37:23.581 --> 00:37:24.342]  I'm going to get into it.
[00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:30.574]  And we've got just, just, just, just so much to cover here.
[00:37:30.594 --> 00:37:38.483]  We're going to have Michael Bolden on from the Tenth Amendment Center to talk about how the states can fight back at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:37:39.653 --> 00:37:44.638]  And then we're going to have John McAfee on, of course, who's coming out with the system.
[00:37:44.678 --> 00:37:48.242]  He says we'll try to block the NSA from spying on you.
[00:37:49.083 --> 00:37:51.666]  So we'll pick his brain about that and see how things have been going for him.
[00:37:52.487 --> 00:37:53.628]  So that's coming up as well.
[00:37:53.668 --> 00:37:57.552]  And we'll take your phone calls for the first 30 minutes of the next hour.
[00:37:57.572 --> 00:38:01.557]  There's so much financial news, I'm just tempted to...
[00:38:04.417 --> 00:38:12.487]  Not even have a guest on in the next hour, but I want to get the 10th Amendment Center on because it's important to talk about how we can change things and how there are states for a reason.
[00:38:12.848 --> 00:38:15.311]  Even if the government says you don't have a right to pray, you do.
[00:38:15.651 --> 00:38:17.614]  Even if the government says the states don't have any rights.
[00:38:17.854 --> 00:38:18.715]  It's all a bluff.
[00:38:18.815 --> 00:38:22.140]  It's all a fraud by consciously criminal scum.
[00:38:24.335 --> 00:38:40.962]  By the way, let me just tell listeners about some of the well-researched, documented systems that I use to protect myself and my family's thyroid and overall system from the increased radiation that is in the northern hemisphere.
[00:38:40.982 --> 00:38:45.944]  It's over double what it was, and Fukushima reactor water pump has now shut down.
[00:38:46.424 --> 00:38:52.227]  The Japan Times is reporting, and that's the big crisis, is that if they
[00:38:53.007 --> 00:39:08.996]  If they can't get all the water pumped in to keep those damaged fuel rods that are stored by the tens of thousands there, they will set on fire and each little fuel rod area will be much bigger than Chernobyl that the UN estimates has killed a million people since 1986.
[00:39:09.296 --> 00:39:10.657]  I mean, that's how big this is.
[00:39:10.677 --> 00:39:16.000]  I mean, I'm actually looking at places in the Southern Hemisphere for my wife and my children.
[00:39:17.802 --> 00:39:18.022]  Okay.
[00:39:18.862 --> 00:39:21.223]  I mean, I've said I'll never evacuate the United States.
[00:39:21.263 --> 00:39:22.103]  I'm going down with a ship.
[00:39:22.123 --> 00:39:27.165]  But I am seriously having to look if that reactor blows up on leaving.
[00:39:27.685 --> 00:39:31.107]  And in the meantime, I'm taking the amazing nascent iodine.
[00:39:31.127 --> 00:39:39.349]  You can find out all the details and what it does at Infowarslife.com and also at Infowarslife.com and Infowarsstore.com.
[00:39:39.649 --> 00:39:41.890]  You can find the modifilin from the Southern Hemisphere.
[00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:46.912]  That's the brown special type of seaweed, the cleanest out there, and they've lab tested it.
[00:39:48.307 --> 00:39:51.660]  And know that the Southern Hemisphere is a lot cleaner obviously than the Northern Hemisphere.
[00:39:52.102 --> 00:39:52.925]  The point is...
[00:39:54.722 --> 00:40:03.924]  Is that the seaweed has the receptors in the ocean to pull in the iodine in the nascent form as well.
[00:40:04.284 --> 00:40:05.425]  So ModifyLon's great.
[00:40:05.805 --> 00:40:08.665]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:40:09.346 --> 00:40:13.887]  InfoWarsLife.com takes you directly to the Survival Shield nascent iodine.
[00:40:13.907 --> 00:40:15.647]  And Wednesday we're getting more of it in.
[00:40:15.667 --> 00:40:17.748]  So it's not really a back order, but it says it's a back order.
[00:40:18.048 --> 00:40:18.628]  But technically
[00:40:19.528 --> 00:40:20.830]  The problem is shipping it all out.
[00:40:20.850 --> 00:40:24.233]  We've shipped out the earlier orders but now we're trying to ship out the other orders.
[00:40:24.574 --> 00:40:29.399]  Very popular product and it's great to get this product and then also fund the broadcast and what we're doing here.
[00:40:29.419 --> 00:40:38.869]  We're not like NPR that has the IRS come with guns and take the old lady's property to then pay for them to sit up there and badmouth the founding fathers and promote abortion and infanticide.
[00:40:40.090 --> 00:40:45.552]  Uh, euthanasia and everything else that the, uh, scum, the authoritarians and their lisping voices push.
[00:40:45.972 --> 00:41:00.537]  We also have the HD car camera, uh, system that's a hidden HD camera that goes over your rearview mirror and is a rearview mirror with a TV screen in it and then a, uh, camera shooting forward or you can turn it and shoot it backward or to the side.
[00:41:01.038 --> 00:41:04.079]  This is the best system out there and we have it lower priced than anybody else.
[00:41:04.499 --> 00:41:06.340]  Infowarsstore.com or call toll free 888.
[00:41:08.046 --> 00:41:08.646]  2-5-3-3-1-3-9-8-8-8-2-5-3-3-1-3-9.
[00:41:09.887 --> 00:41:26.491]  Now, to be a little bit lighter here, I want to air this little two-minute video that John Bowne and Leanne McAdoo put together that promotes a great way to wake people up this Halloween that's coming up.
[00:41:26.531 --> 00:41:35.034]  And again, I don't celebrate Samhain, or the time that the Druids all over Europe burned children in pits at bonfires, now called bonfires.
[00:41:35.874 --> 00:41:43.140]  But a lot of people still go out during this, and you could actually wear the Obama skull mask that's the cover.
[00:41:43.901 --> 00:41:44.842]  It's a big, thick cover.
[00:41:44.942 --> 00:41:47.464]  So you put the little rubber band, cut the rubber band in two, use it.
[00:41:48.305 --> 00:41:53.989]  And then there's also Prozac the Killer Clown on the back, and it says Prozac the Killer Clown on the forehead to have a conversation piece.
[00:41:54.750 --> 00:41:57.833]  You could probably strike up a lot of conversations with these masks.
[00:41:57.873 --> 00:42:03.258]  In fact, I'm predicting, if you were already going out on Halloween, you think it's fun and stuff to go out and be a little goblin?
[00:42:03.818 --> 00:42:06.340]  This is the way to really meet a lot of people and talk to folks.
[00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:11.084]  I'll guarantee you, you're gonna have a lot of conversations with people about this.
[00:42:11.124 --> 00:42:13.627]  So, here's the little promo piece.
[00:42:14.407 --> 00:42:19.412]  We put together and of course it's heavily political and heavily anti the tyrant Obama.
[00:42:19.572 --> 00:42:22.235]  By the way, did you hear Obama wants to change the name of the Redskins?
[00:42:22.495 --> 00:42:23.336]  He says it's racist.
[00:42:23.556 --> 00:42:24.677]  He actually does say that.
[00:42:24.737 --> 00:42:25.798]  If he owned it, he'd change the name.
[00:42:26.679 --> 00:42:28.881]  But he wants to change the name.
[00:42:29.261 --> 00:42:30.922]  Well, he's debating.
[00:42:31.243 --> 00:42:32.244]  Will it be the Bolsheviks?
[00:42:33.205 --> 00:42:34.366]  Or will it be the tyrants?
[00:42:35.126 --> 00:42:36.568]  Or should it be the scumbags?
[00:42:37.308 --> 00:42:38.469]  Or maybe the criminals?
[00:42:39.481 --> 00:42:40.522]  Or maybe the fraudsters.
[00:42:40.542 --> 00:42:41.943]  I mean, you guys got any ideas for names?
[00:42:42.704 --> 00:42:44.805]  In fact, send me at RealAlexJones on Twitter.
[00:42:45.225 --> 00:42:46.126]  Send me links.
[00:42:47.607 --> 00:42:48.308]  Send me texts.
[00:42:48.548 --> 00:42:50.770]  What should we change the name of the Washington Redskins to?
[00:42:51.150 --> 00:42:52.391]  The Washington Serpents?
[00:42:53.672 --> 00:42:54.853]  The Washington Pirates?
[00:42:57.455 --> 00:42:58.475]  Pirates is a good name.
[00:42:59.216 --> 00:43:00.597]  The Washington Skulls?
[00:43:01.458 --> 00:43:02.138]  Skull and Bones.
[00:43:02.158 --> 00:43:03.359]  The Washington Skull and Bones.
[00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:05.561]  The Washington Satans?
[00:43:06.618 --> 00:43:09.360]  The Washington, uh, exterminators?
[00:43:10.060 --> 00:43:12.482]  The Washington, uh, warmongers?
[00:43:13.463 --> 00:43:18.386]  The Washington... How about the Washington death skins?
[00:43:19.206 --> 00:43:24.150]  It could just be like a rotten dead baby on the side of their helmet and a boarded, chopped up baby on the side.
[00:43:24.210 --> 00:43:24.970]  That would be trendy.
[00:43:24.990 --> 00:43:25.631]  That would be cool.
[00:43:27.752 --> 00:43:28.593]  I'm trying to be trendy here.
[00:43:29.707 --> 00:43:31.388]  I mean, it could just be Obama as the devil.
[00:43:31.428 --> 00:43:33.610]  I mean, that could be on the side of the helmet.
[00:43:34.451 --> 00:43:36.973]  The Washington Con Artist is probably the best name.
[00:43:37.313 --> 00:43:38.874]  So here's that video.
[00:43:38.894 --> 00:43:40.976]  If you're a radio listener, you can go to InfoWars.com.
[00:43:41.596 --> 00:43:44.959]  And I'm going to have the folks post the video up on the main site, but here it is.
[00:43:46.701 --> 00:43:50.965]  We take this business of waking people up very seriously here at InfoWars.
[00:43:51.285 --> 00:43:53.707]  That's why we have such a huge outreach operation.
[00:43:53.947 --> 00:43:57.610]  And it wouldn't be possible without the InfoWars magazine.
[00:43:57.950 --> 00:44:01.093]  And we have a very special October edition for you.
[00:44:01.473 --> 00:44:08.039]  We're going to make it super easy for you to get interactive with your friends and family by giving you these lovely cutout masks.
[00:44:08.179 --> 00:44:08.699]  Not one.
[00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:14.484]  But two very scary educational tools for you to hit the street.
[00:44:14.804 --> 00:44:16.865]  Join with the collective.
[00:44:16.965 --> 00:44:21.468]  Just go to sleep and when you awaken, there'll be no more free will.
[00:44:21.909 --> 00:44:23.030]  And whatever you do, don't resist.
[00:44:23.070 --> 00:44:24.871]  We thought we'd give Obama equal time.
[00:44:25.231 --> 00:44:28.093]  Specialinfo.com magazine.
[00:44:28.433 --> 00:44:30.315]  Whatever you do, don't resist.
[00:44:30.935 --> 00:44:31.776]  Give in.
[00:44:33.311 --> 00:44:41.818]  260,000 of you could be out there as Obamacare or Prozac, the killer clown.
[00:44:47.542 --> 00:44:55.749]  Just cut along the dotted lines, cut some holes for the eyes and attach a few rubber bands and you are ready to wake up America this Halloween.
[00:44:56.323 --> 00:45:01.384]  Remember kids, Obamacare is for you and your family, and so is Prozac and Ritalin.
[00:45:01.745 --> 00:45:09.227]  So whatever you do, don't secure your copy of InfoWars Magazine and resist, because death is good for you.
[00:45:13.108 --> 00:45:15.448]  And that's the battle cry of the Obamanoid right there.
[00:45:15.588 --> 00:45:16.849]  It's right on the body snatchers.
[00:45:16.929 --> 00:45:17.089]  Ah!
[00:45:25.011 --> 00:45:27.772]  You can pick up your copy today at the Infowars store.
[00:45:27.832 --> 00:45:33.635]  You can always buy these in bulk at cost, and for a limited time, the annual subscription is just $39.95.
[00:45:33.755 --> 00:45:38.437]  Call now if your operators are standing by.
[00:45:40.358 --> 00:45:44.139]  Because people need to know that Obamacare is bone-chillingly frightening.
[00:45:44.399 --> 00:45:48.581]  But it's bone-chillingly trendy, and that's all that matters.
[00:45:49.962 --> 00:45:52.643]  I don't think they use the best shot of Jake doing a body snatcher deal.
[00:45:53.387 --> 00:46:00.171]  Because me and Jake joke around back there, one of the great guys in shipping, and he likes to do that body snatcher stare where he goes, ahh, or like, uh.
[00:46:00.531 --> 00:46:01.392]  And so I got him to do it.
[00:46:01.412 --> 00:46:03.333]  I don't think that's the best clip we have, actually.
[00:46:03.533 --> 00:46:04.874]  We need to get the raw footage of that.
[00:46:06.175 --> 00:46:07.796]  And there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:46:08.776 --> 00:46:09.897]  Gotta have a little bit of fun with it.
[00:46:12.406 --> 00:46:17.568]  Meanwhile, Japan is now asking for international community to help solve the Fukushima crisis.
[00:46:18.109 --> 00:46:20.109]  As they say, it now threatens all of humanity.
[00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:21.790]  That's London Telegraph.
[00:46:21.830 --> 00:46:23.331]  I thought I'd just get to that second headline.
[00:46:23.351 --> 00:46:24.311]  I didn't finish up with that.
[00:46:25.532 --> 00:46:27.433]  Let me get into the economy right now.
[00:46:27.993 --> 00:46:30.774]  I'll just go over some of these headlines for radio listeners out there.
[00:46:31.615 --> 00:46:32.975]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[00:46:37.995 --> 00:46:38.575]  800-259-9231.
[00:46:39.256 --> 00:46:44.819]  It's not like the Obamacare line.
[00:46:44.839 --> 00:46:46.160]  It doesn't really spell anything out.
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:51.703]  You know, the Obamacare line says 1-800, literally, F-U.
[00:46:52.363 --> 00:46:53.163]  It's what it's spelled.
[00:46:53.424 --> 00:46:55.485]  And of course, it's all on purpose, I'm telling you.
[00:46:55.825 --> 00:47:00.828]  It's all such a sick joke, hurting those poor people as badly as they could.
[00:47:00.848 --> 00:47:02.689]  You know, last Thursday, I saw that headline on Drudge.
[00:47:03.959 --> 00:47:04.779]  And it didn't click.
[00:47:04.819 --> 00:47:08.401]  I thought it was like a joke or something saying it's 1-800-FU.
[00:47:09.482 --> 00:47:12.363]  And then plus, I tried to have a family show, so I didn't go there for whatever reason.
[00:47:12.863 --> 00:47:14.744]  And then after the show, I looked at it and went, wait a minute.
[00:47:17.445 --> 00:47:23.048]  It actually does spell that out.
[00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:32.564]  And Obama always does that thing that Geraldo Rivera did when I got arrested protesting him where he acts like he's scratching his eye but flips you off.
[00:47:33.404 --> 00:47:35.766]  He just does that to his constituents.
[00:47:37.247 --> 00:47:50.334]  The hotline set up for those waiting to learn more about insurance options made available under the Affordable Care Act, see that name's a joke, it's already doubled the prices, spells out an unfortunate insult on the telephone keypad.
[00:47:56.038 --> 00:47:58.961]  Man, I tell you, and they even spelled it out twice in code.
[00:47:58.981 --> 00:48:01.464]  All right, that's enough.
[00:48:02.425 --> 00:48:03.406]  I can't deal with it anymore.
[00:48:04.086 --> 00:48:10.713]  Let's get into the big hammering they're giving us.
[00:48:12.035 --> 00:48:14.658]  Markets tumbling all around the world.
[00:48:15.599 --> 00:48:16.900]  Economy set to slow.
[00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:18.261]  Debt ceiling crisis grows.
[00:48:18.281 --> 00:48:18.442]  Yes.
[00:48:19.548 --> 00:48:36.680]  And they're saying that if you don't up the debt ceiling and don't give them Obamacare, that that's why the world markets are set to tumble, even though everybody knew with the QE3, the markets have continued to really be degenerating, even though there's a sugar high of above 15,000 points that's now gone below on the Dow Jones.
[00:48:37.521 --> 00:48:38.221]  Industrial average.
[00:48:38.521 --> 00:48:46.163]  And remember, they're buying all of those stocks and bonds and things with devalued dollars.
[00:48:46.863 --> 00:48:51.064]  So the stock market really is at about 7,000 points, according to a lot of economists we've talked to.
[00:48:52.044 --> 00:48:55.845]  I mean, I took my children rock climbing, one of those indoor rock climbing places.
[00:48:56.646 --> 00:48:58.366]  Guess how much the bottled water was?
[00:49:00.767 --> 00:49:01.967]  In the vending machines, it was $3.
[00:49:02.007 --> 00:49:02.227]  $3, folks.
[00:49:02.247 --> 00:49:02.627]  A Gatorade was $4.
[00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:10.582]  $4.
[00:49:09.681 --> 00:49:10.582]  And I know why it's $4.
[00:49:11.863 --> 00:49:14.724]  It's because the dollar isn't worth what it used to be.
[00:49:14.764 --> 00:49:19.007]  It's lost 93% of its value from 1913 to 2008.
[00:49:20.388 --> 00:49:25.071]  Guess what the dollar, you can pull up the dollar graph from 1913, actually show it to viewers.
[00:49:26.292 --> 00:49:33.217]  Since they devalued the currency, you know, that last 3% of what people thought the dollar's value was,
[00:49:34.909 --> 00:49:40.670]  That's why you could go in the, you know, 50s and get a hamburger and fries and a bottomless Coca-Cola for 25 cents.
[00:49:41.591 --> 00:49:42.391]  Now, that'd be like $10.
[00:49:42.471 --> 00:49:46.532]  If you're lucky, at a nice hamburger place, $15.
[00:49:47.992 --> 00:49:48.732]  See, quarter, $15.
[00:49:50.473 --> 00:49:51.473]  Quarter, $10.
[00:49:52.533 --> 00:49:56.354]  Brand new Mustang, the 1950s was a couple thousand dollars, maybe?
[00:49:57.434 --> 00:49:59.355]  Now it's $40,000 if you want it loaded up.
[00:50:01.152 --> 00:50:04.094]  Yes, there is the devaluation of the dollar up till 2002.
[00:50:05.975 --> 00:50:11.858]  You can see there a 95% reduction, but by 2008 it was 97% reduction.
[00:50:12.318 --> 00:50:16.180]  And if you look at one of the new graphs, it is now 99%.
[00:50:16.220 --> 00:50:20.663]  And we're all just holding on to that last 1%.
[00:50:21.683 --> 00:50:28.067]  And the media is up there, the controlled globalist media is saying, there's no devaluation, the dollar's strong as ever.
[00:50:29.966 --> 00:50:30.667]  I shouldn't laugh.
[00:50:31.588 --> 00:50:34.151]  At least real estate's up again in many areas, yeah.
[00:50:34.651 --> 00:50:36.013]  Because of the inflation.
[00:50:37.294 --> 00:50:39.036]  And because of the inflation in property tax.
[00:50:39.437 --> 00:50:42.560]  Government wants to keep valuing it up and up and so do the other marketers.
[00:50:42.940 --> 00:50:47.706]  I'm telling you, when the economy goes belly up, it is going to be spectacular.
[00:50:49.022 --> 00:50:50.444]  It may even be the breakdown of society.
[00:50:50.764 --> 00:51:02.999]  The Swiss Army thinks that's going to happen, so they're bolstering their forces for Europe to collapse, and they have orders to mow the Germans and the French and the Italians and others down when they try to pour in.
[00:51:03.971 --> 00:51:06.893]  I'm telling you, Switzerland might be the place to go, folks.
[00:51:07.414 --> 00:51:08.034]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:08.094 --> 00:51:08.795]  Obama loves you.
[00:51:09.736 --> 00:51:11.837]  Turn your food waste into fertilizer.
[00:51:11.998 --> 00:51:12.538]  That's right.

[00:53:14.629 --> 00:53:23.114]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[00:53:23.535 --> 00:53:30.820]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow Patriots.

[00:54:01.756 --> 00:54:05.798]  It is essential to prepare with My Patriot Supply today.
[00:54:24.571 --> 00:54:28.196]  You know, I haven't even gotten to our top stories up on InfoWars.com.
[00:54:28.637 --> 00:54:30.820]  They're also up at the top of DrugsReport.com.
[00:54:32.382 --> 00:54:33.724]  Feel the pain.
[00:54:34.545 --> 00:54:37.850]  Feds throw Man 80 and Wife 77 out of home.
[00:54:37.870 --> 00:54:40.654]  Because they love you.
[00:54:41.355 --> 00:54:52.957]  Amber Alert website shut down, but Michelle Obama has five chefs working for her, and they continue to have the Osprey at the cost of millions of dollars a week, fly their dogs around.
[00:54:53.357 --> 00:54:56.518]  Park Rangers ordered to keep visitors out of privately run businesses.
[00:54:57.158 --> 00:55:00.418]  They're closing pull-offs to bar views of Mount Rushmore.
[00:55:00.438 --> 00:55:05.259]  They aren't even federal property, but it doesn't matter.
[00:55:06.039 --> 00:55:09.720]  Just wait until they've got full control over the economy, which they've almost got.
[00:55:11.423 --> 00:55:18.245]  And it continues, 83% of federal government still operating only the parts that the slaves get.
[00:55:18.505 --> 00:55:24.626]  And by the way, when you go to a national park, they literally henpeck you and treat you like trash to let you know you're scum.
[00:55:25.866 --> 00:55:26.246]  Openly!
[00:55:27.347 --> 00:55:33.568]  That's why the Park Service is calling for all the beaches to be shut down nationwide, that humans not be allowed to hurt the ocean.
[00:55:34.148 --> 00:55:38.269]  Oh, the proposal two years ago was to shut them all down to swimming.
[00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:46.866]  But they just said, no, no, we'll have, in one area, 80% of the beach will be off-limits to swimming to give the ocean a rest.
[00:55:48.707 --> 00:55:53.071]  No, it's all about dominating you and teaching you what scum you are.
[00:55:54.532 --> 00:56:02.459]  And so again, they blocked Mount Rushmore, and now they've actually blocked, miles away, the pull-offs.
[00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:04.600]  The pull-offs.
[00:56:05.601 --> 00:56:07.142]  So you can't pull off and see it.
[00:56:07.182 --> 00:56:08.684]  Do you understand scum?
[00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:13.331]  Because they have to have the illusion that something's being shut down.
[00:56:13.731 --> 00:56:14.731]  Nothing's being shut down.
[00:56:15.111 --> 00:56:17.711]  Trillions every few months are sucked out to foreign banks.
[00:56:18.092 --> 00:56:20.272]  I watch the banking hearings of the House and Senate.
[00:56:20.332 --> 00:56:21.952]  Every time they say, man, please know where the money went.
[00:56:22.212 --> 00:56:23.693]  And they get up there and they go, no!
[00:56:26.213 --> 00:56:29.734]  And the Congress people grovel because they're pathetic maggots.
[00:56:30.654 --> 00:56:34.215]  And then I'm supposed to not get upset about it, that's right.
[00:56:34.915 --> 00:56:36.515]  And then they hold us hostage.
[00:56:38.216 --> 00:56:39.956]  Isn't that just cutie cake?
[00:56:42.426 --> 00:56:44.147]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:44.187 --> 00:56:46.768]  This is what the vile scum are doing.
[00:56:47.548 --> 00:56:51.209]  You know, Ceaușescu in Romania, they had power to run the whole country.
[00:56:51.989 --> 00:56:52.770]  All the major cities.
[00:56:52.810 --> 00:56:55.030]  But he just said, no, people don't need power.
[00:56:55.310 --> 00:56:58.091]  Turn the power off except for factories I run and control.
[00:56:58.572 --> 00:56:59.932]  We need to make them more poor.
[00:57:00.692 --> 00:57:02.113]  And finally they turned against him.
[00:57:02.493 --> 00:57:03.293]  That's what they do.
[00:57:03.413 --> 00:57:04.914]  And they're shutting down our power plants.
[00:57:05.234 --> 00:57:08.435]  They're shutting down at least one every two days.
[00:57:10.296 --> 00:57:11.056]  Hundreds a year.
[00:57:12.466 --> 00:57:16.287]  Hundreds of you, and their power prices are going up and up and up and up and up.
[00:57:16.747 --> 00:57:17.927]  Because they love you.
[00:57:18.427 --> 00:57:19.187]  They love you.
[00:57:19.267 --> 00:57:20.308]  They want to fix things.
[00:57:20.568 --> 00:57:21.668]  Don't be an extremist.
[00:57:21.688 --> 00:57:22.668]  Don't be a racist.
[00:57:23.008 --> 00:57:24.428]  Do what they say or you're racist.
[00:57:24.728 --> 00:57:27.149]  Don't question the persecution of the press or you're racist.
[00:57:28.409 --> 00:57:29.869]  A lot of people are going, OK, I won't.
[00:57:29.909 --> 00:57:30.370]  That's right.
[00:57:30.390 --> 00:57:31.330]  The worst thing on earth.
[00:57:31.510 --> 00:57:32.710]  Your kids starving to death.
[00:57:32.950 --> 00:57:33.970]  America collapsing.
[00:57:33.990 --> 00:57:34.670]  That doesn't matter.
[00:57:35.151 --> 00:57:36.911]  You don't want to be called not trendy.
[00:57:37.677 --> 00:57:38.337]  Let's continue.
[00:57:38.377 --> 00:57:39.557]  Markets tumbling around the world.
[00:57:39.897 --> 00:57:40.878]  Obama to Wall Street.
[00:57:41.418 --> 00:57:42.718]  This time to be worried.
[00:57:43.978 --> 00:57:44.418]  That's right.
[00:57:44.678 --> 00:57:46.839]  He's now rattling the markets, trying to scare everybody.
[00:57:46.899 --> 00:57:52.480]  Rand Paul says it's irresponsible to have the Commander-in-Chief come out and badmouth the markets.
[00:57:52.500 --> 00:57:53.560]  Well, that's the whole plan!
[00:57:54.120 --> 00:58:00.282]  Just like Bush and others did in 2008, when the Democrats and Senator Obama led the charge for Goldman Sachs.
[00:58:00.342 --> 00:58:02.002]  He led the charge!
[00:58:03.035 --> 00:58:10.057]  He led the Senate vote to give unlimited money to foreign banks while he publicly afterwards said he was against it.
[00:58:10.917 --> 00:58:13.678]  And his moron constituents actually believe it.
[00:58:13.878 --> 00:58:16.438]  Well of course, they don't even know who they are, they don't even know what party he's in.
[00:58:16.818 --> 00:58:20.159]  These people can't, I tell you, most Obamas, well I'm not going to get into it.
[00:58:21.279 --> 00:58:22.980]  I've just noticed most Obama supporters smell.
[00:58:24.113 --> 00:58:25.794]  Because they don't even know how to wipe their butts, folks.
[00:58:25.854 --> 00:58:26.354]  I'm telling you.
[00:58:26.454 --> 00:58:27.074]  I'm not joking.
[00:58:27.735 --> 00:58:29.755]  These people are... Okay, I'm sorry.
[00:58:30.916 --> 00:58:32.737]  Fed will have to taper at some point.
[00:58:32.757 --> 00:58:37.859]  CNBC's reporting shutdown may idle non-federal workers next week.
[00:58:38.559 --> 00:58:38.819]  U.S.
[00:58:38.879 --> 00:58:41.681]  jobless claims show job market healing.
[00:58:42.321 --> 00:58:43.761]  Oh yes, everything's fine.
[00:58:44.722 --> 00:58:47.143]  We'll be right back with your phone calls and a lot more.
[00:58:52.287 --> 00:58:56.238]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.

[01:00:02.610 --> 01:00:04.510]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:04.990 --> 01:00:07.751]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:14.298 --> 01:00:18.480]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:19.121 --> 01:00:19.941]  You want answers?
[01:00:20.702 --> 01:00:21.622]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:22.263 --> 01:00:25.905]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:26.445 --> 01:00:30.547]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:31.728 --> 01:00:33.989]  Steve Watson's got an article that just broke.
[01:00:35.870 --> 01:00:39.993]  The headline is, Was Government Amber Alert Offline Notice a Fake?
[01:00:41.618 --> 01:00:45.561]  Website restored after possible re-routing scam exposed.
[01:00:47.842 --> 01:00:51.065]  No, they did shut the website down, and the article explains this.
[01:00:51.425 --> 01:00:55.988]  And then now they're just saying it was a mistake or something, because that's too big.
[01:00:56.388 --> 01:01:00.531]  Their whole Amber Alert system, it's really their federal media takeover system.
[01:01:00.951 --> 01:01:02.753]  The fact that they would claim that it was turned off.
[01:01:03.433 --> 01:01:05.135]  They're turning anything off they can.
[01:01:05.696 --> 01:01:06.457]  Because they hate us.
[01:01:06.717 --> 01:01:07.197]  I'm sorry.
[01:01:07.237 --> 01:01:08.459]  It's just absolutely true.
[01:01:08.919 --> 01:01:11.562]  Now they won't let you pull off on the side of the road at Mount Rushmore.
[01:01:11.943 --> 01:01:13.785]  They're blocking boat docks up the Mississippi.
[01:01:13.805 --> 01:01:15.607]  The feds don't even control.
[01:01:16.208 --> 01:01:17.269]  They're just out of control.
[01:01:18.110 --> 01:01:19.752]  Let's go to your phone calls right now.
[01:01:19.792 --> 01:01:21.073]  Then I'm going to get into Rand Paul.
[01:01:21.093 --> 01:01:22.695]  Says he's irresponsible.
[01:01:23.576 --> 01:01:28.280]  of Obozo to talk about default, and that is rattling markets worldwide.
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:29.361]  We're going to be getting into that.
[01:01:29.401 --> 01:01:31.964]  That is financial terrorism, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:01:32.324 --> 01:01:34.266]  But right now, let's go to your phone calls.
[01:01:34.286 --> 01:01:37.028]  Janae in California, you're on the air.
[01:01:37.068 --> 01:01:37.369]  Welcome.
[01:01:39.611 --> 01:01:40.011]  Jeannie.
[01:01:40.571 --> 01:01:40.972]  Jeannie.
[01:01:41.232 --> 01:01:42.013]  I dream of Jeannie.
[01:01:42.033 --> 01:01:42.854]  Is this Alex Jones?
[01:01:42.874 --> 01:01:43.234]  Yes, it is.
[01:01:43.274 --> 01:01:43.674]  Go ahead.
[01:01:44.135 --> 01:01:44.795]  Alex Jones.
[01:01:44.875 --> 01:01:47.598]  I'm a nurse in California.
[01:01:48.198 --> 01:01:49.840]  I live in Placerville.
[01:01:50.675 --> 01:01:56.039]  I commute 50 miles down to Sacramento every day, six days a week.
[01:01:56.519 --> 01:01:59.061]  I have on my car impeachment stickers.
[01:02:00.002 --> 01:02:01.863]  I have InfoWars, Prison Planet.
[01:02:03.404 --> 01:02:06.786]  I'm going to be making a bumper sticker that says, Got Truth?
[01:02:07.647 --> 01:02:09.768]  And then underneath it, InfoWars.com.
[01:02:11.329 --> 01:02:14.672]  So I'm basically an advertisement for InfoWars.
[01:02:14.692 --> 01:02:16.113]  Well, that sounds pretty racist.
[01:02:18.672 --> 01:02:21.934]  Yeah, and I just want to wake up my fellow nurses.
[01:02:22.414 --> 01:02:23.554]  It's pretty pathetic.
[01:02:23.895 --> 01:02:30.117]  I work for a major HMO, and most of the nurses just don't have a clue.
[01:02:30.137 --> 01:02:30.678]  They're clueless.
[01:02:31.298 --> 01:02:32.098]  Let me ask you this.
[01:02:32.138 --> 01:02:35.860]  What is your take as an expert who's living on Obamacare?
[01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:41.103]  I mean, we know the premiums are already doubling, but how is this affecting your patients?
[01:02:42.263 --> 01:02:47.886]  Well, I actually, I'm trained emergency room, but I work at a call center now because of an injury.
[01:02:48.795 --> 01:02:59.918]  And we have to give out advice that I just, it's pathetic because a lot of the advice is, you know, on vaccines and things that are really not healthy.
[01:03:01.018 --> 01:03:02.739]  And trying to wake up the nurses.
[01:03:02.819 --> 01:03:06.320]  I have stickers on my desk about fluoride, aspartame.
[01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:11.441]  I can't put anything on vaccines or I'd probably lose my job.
[01:03:12.181 --> 01:03:17.923]  But there will eventually be forced vaccines for the workers, for everybody that works
[01:03:18.516 --> 01:03:22.059]  Well, I'm doing the best I can trying to get the word out.
[01:03:37.303 --> 01:03:54.069]  What I would recommend nurses to do, or any students in any college, if they're giving research papers, presentations, I would highly recommend that they do research papers on things like chemtrails, fluoride, the phenol A, aspartame.
[01:03:54.369 --> 01:04:00.151]  Just try to get the word out that way so people can start to wake up and see that our government is corrupt.
[01:04:00.371 --> 01:04:03.572]  EPA and FDA are totally corrupt.
[01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:07.072]  And just try to get the word out that way.
[01:04:07.653 --> 01:04:08.293]  Absolutely.
[01:04:08.553 --> 01:04:09.214]  Absolutely.
[01:04:09.314 --> 01:04:10.995]  We'll just keep it up and God bless you.
[01:04:11.035 --> 01:04:11.615]  Good to hear from you.
[01:04:11.635 --> 01:04:12.316]  We're going to come back.
[01:04:12.976 --> 01:04:15.678]  Ladies and gentlemen, everything just clicked for me while she was talking.
[01:04:15.718 --> 01:04:20.241]  I wasn't ignoring her, but I was halfway listening just because it's so stunning.
[01:04:20.762 --> 01:04:24.865]  I saw this headline, Was Government Amber Alert Offline Notice of Fake?
[01:04:25.205 --> 01:04:26.766]  I'm not even going to try to call Steve Watson.
[01:04:26.786 --> 01:04:27.507]  He's a great writer.
[01:04:27.547 --> 01:04:29.008]  I'm the main editor around here.
[01:04:29.787 --> 01:04:31.889]  Will you call Don Salazar in here?
[01:04:31.909 --> 01:04:34.551]  Because Steve doesn't work here in our office.
[01:04:34.992 --> 01:04:42.278]  This headline should read, Justice Department caught in Amber Alert takedown hoax.
[01:04:43.319 --> 01:04:44.340]  But Steve's being careful.
[01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:45.861]  He says, was government Amber Alert.
[01:04:46.716 --> 01:04:47.937]  Offline notice of fake.
[01:04:47.957 --> 01:04:48.838]  This is what I noticed.
[01:04:49.658 --> 01:04:51.339]  I'm no IT guy, but I've learned a lot about it.
[01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:55.422]  About the National Park Service shutting down all their sites and saying it's shut down.
[01:04:55.722 --> 01:04:56.843]  The sites are all still there.
[01:04:57.063 --> 01:04:57.844]  They're still running.
[01:04:58.444 --> 01:05:00.286]  They just block access to it.
[01:05:00.546 --> 01:05:02.807]  And that's what the Justice Department got caught doing.
[01:05:03.948 --> 01:05:06.130]  They went and deliberately shut it down.
[01:05:06.170 --> 01:05:06.990]  They've been caught.
[01:05:07.090 --> 01:05:07.691]  Wow, this is big.

[01:05:15.707 --> 01:05:24.174]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[01:05:24.594 --> 01:05:31.881]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow Patriots.

[01:06:10.657 --> 01:06:11.778]  We are winning.
[01:06:11.838 --> 01:06:19.060]  Alternative media is challenging and beating mainstream media, and it's imperative for the liberty movement to continue this momentum.
[01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:26.121]  However, independent media cannot win without the support of sponsors and advertisers like Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:06:26.581 --> 01:06:31.923]  For over 26 years, Diamond Gusset has been owned by patriots with products designed for patriots.

[01:06:49.279 --> 01:06:50.701]  Another reason for my endorsement.

[01:07:13.442 --> 01:07:16.185]  An outbreak of contagious disease can happen anywhere.
[01:07:16.485 --> 01:07:19.006]  And the threat of bioterrorism is always at hand.
[01:07:19.307 --> 01:07:24.710]  Because we're faced with more diseases than ever before, we need a better solution than ever before.

[01:08:14.517 --> 01:08:18.718]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:08:19.338 --> 01:08:20.158]  You want answers?
[01:08:20.938 --> 01:08:21.899]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:22.479 --> 01:08:26.099]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:26.660 --> 01:08:30.780]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:36.682 --> 01:08:38.762]  Folks, I am stunned right now.
[01:08:38.802 --> 01:08:41.983]  This happens a lot as news breaks throughout the day.
[01:08:43.553 --> 01:08:49.517]  But about five minutes ago, an article went up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com by Steve Watson.
[01:08:50.418 --> 01:09:04.907]  And as the overall omnibus director or editor, chief cook and bottle washer, I didn't even try to contact Steve Watson in England, in Albion, in Britannia, a great writer and political scientist that he is.
[01:09:06.028 --> 01:09:12.172]  I just ran into Adon Salazar and had him change the headline because it's not hardcore enough
[01:09:13.524 --> 01:09:16.286]  All the data just clicked, and we've got to add this to the story.
[01:09:16.306 --> 01:09:17.868]  I've got a Don editing it right now.
[01:09:18.448 --> 01:09:20.330]  Or if Steve's listening, he can talk to a Don.
[01:09:20.350 --> 01:09:20.790]  He can do it.
[01:09:21.471 --> 01:09:22.792]  But I know there's six hours ahead.
[01:09:22.852 --> 01:09:23.993]  Steve probably just got off.
[01:09:25.994 --> 01:09:30.278]  His brother won't be getting off till midnight because wild horses can't drag old Paul Watson away.
[01:09:31.099 --> 01:09:32.580]  He is absolutely in it to win it.
[01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:33.721]  Steve's awesome as well.
[01:09:34.041 --> 01:09:35.062]  Just as smart as his brother.
[01:09:35.082 --> 01:09:36.943]  It's just he doesn't work 18 hours a day like Paul.
[01:09:37.744 --> 01:09:42.288]  My point is, and I'm digressing, this is so massive, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:09:44.031 --> 01:09:45.719]  You know it's come out that they're blocking.
[01:09:47.336 --> 01:09:47.616]  No.
[01:10:17.796 --> 01:10:18.797]  Carved into stone.
[01:10:19.597 --> 01:10:20.697]  Well, guess what's happened?
[01:10:21.297 --> 01:10:33.342]  They have gone on non-federal property, miles away, and are putting up barricades on mountain pull-offs so that families can't pull off and can't see it.
[01:10:34.382 --> 01:10:36.163]  And I'm telling you, that is the spirit now.
[01:10:37.223 --> 01:10:42.085]  At the Grand Canyon and at the Texas coast, the last two national parks
[01:10:43.214 --> 01:10:48.057]  I've been to Grand Canyon, Big Bend, the Texas coast, I guess that's three.
[01:10:49.558 --> 01:10:52.660]  They will come out of their way to treat you like garbage.
[01:10:52.740 --> 01:10:53.681]  I mean, they will come over.
[01:10:54.041 --> 01:10:56.583]  And I thought, well, it's just because I'm a man, one-time hiking.
[01:10:56.823 --> 01:11:01.766]  No, they go up to women, families, boss people around.
[01:11:01.786 --> 01:11:03.567]  I mean, it's like North Korea.
[01:11:05.208 --> 01:11:08.711]  In fact, I've never been anywhere in the world where they treat people this bad.
[01:11:10.390 --> 01:11:17.772]  First place I ever saw it was a decade ago in DC, where you'd be taking video of the Washington Monument in the middle of a field.
[01:11:18.252 --> 01:11:20.753]  And the cops would walk over and say, you can't film.
[01:11:20.953 --> 01:11:21.753]  Who are you filming for?
[01:11:21.773 --> 01:11:25.034]  And I'm like, well, I actually have a TV show.
[01:11:25.214 --> 01:11:26.094]  Oh, you need a permit.
[01:11:26.675 --> 01:11:28.855]  Well, no, they don't give permits in DC.
[01:11:29.195 --> 01:11:30.576]  Don't get smart with me, buddy.
[01:11:31.236 --> 01:11:32.076]  I'm like, but you know that.
[01:11:32.096 --> 01:11:33.056]  And he goes, I don't care.
[01:11:33.757 --> 01:11:34.577]  Get out of here.
[01:11:36.117 --> 01:11:38.718]  And you're like, wow, you really are a tyrant.
[01:11:39.551 --> 01:11:43.654]  They put their hand on their gun, they go, listen, you want to do this the easy way or the hard way?
[01:11:44.254 --> 01:11:46.035]  And then you see them do it to families with kids.
[01:11:46.075 --> 01:11:48.577]  I mean, this country is so pathetic.
[01:11:48.937 --> 01:11:51.659]  I mean, we are not the land of the free, home of the brave.
[01:11:51.699 --> 01:11:53.200]  We will put up with anything.
[01:11:53.820 --> 01:11:57.603]  And people think groveling to government gets the government to be nice to you.
[01:11:57.923 --> 01:11:59.044]  No, it's the opposite.
[01:12:00.205 --> 01:12:01.546]  I'll never forget being in New York.
[01:12:02.946 --> 01:12:04.227]  Again, 10 years ago.
[01:12:04.247 --> 01:12:06.129]  Maybe 11 years ago.
[01:12:07.065 --> 01:12:10.329]  And asking a cop, Sir, do you know where this is?
[01:12:11.951 --> 01:12:14.314]  And the guy yelling and saying, Do I look like a phone book?
[01:12:16.336 --> 01:12:18.639]  You don't talk to God!
[01:12:20.051 --> 01:12:25.052]  Moses had to do it through a burning bush, and only saw God's, you know, from an angle.
[01:12:25.752 --> 01:12:30.694]  Yeah, I mean, I believe now that we probably should be executed if we look at a government person.
[01:12:31.234 --> 01:12:31.834]  I'm serious.
[01:12:32.434 --> 01:12:33.174]  They are God.
[01:12:33.394 --> 01:12:34.075]  They are King.
[01:12:34.875 --> 01:12:36.055]  They made the sun come up.
[01:12:36.375 --> 01:12:37.135]  They had me.
[01:12:37.615 --> 01:12:38.576]  They built the planet.
[01:12:38.916 --> 01:12:39.676]  They did it all.
[01:12:39.776 --> 01:12:43.457]  George Washington, as the Army Training Manual will say, is a bad man.
[01:12:43.957 --> 01:12:44.577]  I agree with him.
[01:12:44.878 --> 01:12:45.778]  This isn't absurd.
[01:12:45.798 --> 01:12:47.519]  This isn't satire.
[01:12:47.759 --> 01:12:49.800]  The point is, this is not absurdist.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:50.781]  This is not satire.
[01:12:50.961 --> 01:12:53.162]  They're really doing all of this.
[01:12:53.222 --> 01:12:54.122]  I said I'd go to your calls.
[01:12:56.003 --> 01:13:10.311]  My brain exploded into a kaleidoscope, a cornucopia, a spectrum, a galaxy of points when I saw the headline up on InfoWars.com, Was Government Amber Alert Offline Notice a Fake?
[01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:18.542]  And the headline doesn't exactly make sense because it was a fake by the Justice Department, but it makes it sound like it was a fake total.
[01:13:18.902 --> 01:13:20.123]  So I've had it changed.
[01:13:20.163 --> 01:13:21.083]  It should be up by now.
[01:13:21.783 --> 01:13:24.024]  Tell them to go ahead and update it before the stuff I wrote.
[01:13:25.644 --> 01:13:28.385]  I had them record something I want to add to the article, but I don't want them to wait.
[01:13:28.405 --> 01:13:30.466]  I want to just change the headline now and then update it later.
[01:13:31.306 --> 01:13:37.048]  Because then I read it, and then I saw what the tech people were saying and went and looked at it, and indeed,
[01:13:38.334 --> 01:13:43.636]  It's just a fake screen up there with a whole Amber Alert site behind it.
[01:13:44.396 --> 01:13:48.598]  And any type of web person knows how to go find the root and actually find the site.
[01:13:49.739 --> 01:13:52.179]  So the site's up, the site's running, it's actually there.
[01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:56.621]  The Amber Alerts are still running, it's part of essential functions, 83% of the government.
[01:13:57.041 --> 01:14:01.763]  And they just put that up to create the hoax, the fraud.
[01:14:01.803 --> 01:14:06.105]  These are criminals that ship guns to Mexico to kill people so they could blame the Second Amendment.
[01:14:08.294 --> 01:14:20.188]  I mean, this is so incredible, and I just got a massive headache, basically, when I saw the article, because it made me so incredibly angry.
[01:14:20.488 --> 01:14:20.908]  There it is.
[01:14:20.928 --> 01:14:22.050]  The article's been changed.
[01:14:22.470 --> 01:14:25.894]  Justice Department caught in Amber Alert takedown hoax.
[01:14:26.295 --> 01:14:28.898]  Website restored after public discovered sites were up.
[01:14:30.233 --> 01:14:31.454]  But being rerouted.
[01:14:32.094 --> 01:14:33.775]  Unbelievable!
[01:14:34.315 --> 01:14:35.276]  Note from Alex Jones.
[01:14:35.296 --> 01:14:37.537]  Man, a Don wrote that fast off my recording.
[01:14:37.858 --> 01:14:41.180]  This is part of a criminal pattern of obstruction to taxpayer-funded services.
[01:14:42.140 --> 01:14:48.224]  As with Mount Rushmore, highway pull-offs and boat ramps on the Mississippi are being blocked.
[01:14:49.531 --> 01:15:04.548]  We probably want to say, as in Mount Rushmore Inn, the state it's in, and highway pull-offs and boat ramps in Mississippi being blocked, the system wants to make the shutdown as painful for the American people as possible as National Park Service Rangers have admitted.
[01:15:04.908 --> 01:15:08.352]  This is outright criminal because the Amber Alert site is still up.
[01:15:08.592 --> 01:15:09.654]  They're simply blocking it.
[01:15:10.114 --> 01:15:15.599]  And then we're going to add a link in there to the good Park Service person who I bet will get audited or killed.
[01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:16.380]  I'm not kidding.
[01:15:16.841 --> 01:15:19.423]  When you work for them and you go against them, they will kill you.
[01:15:19.743 --> 01:15:20.304]  I'm not kidding.
[01:15:20.724 --> 01:15:21.906]  It's like you belong to them now.
[01:15:21.926 --> 01:15:22.786]  They have these weird rules.
[01:15:23.227 --> 01:15:25.689]  And they've had senior park rangers say it's disgusting.
[01:15:25.909 --> 01:15:28.292]  We've been ordered to make things painful because they're not all criminals.
[01:15:29.281 --> 01:15:31.584]  And I've still run into park rangers that are, hi, how you doing?
[01:15:31.765 --> 01:15:33.347]  Oh, they'll give you directions that are nice.
[01:15:33.387 --> 01:15:38.675]  But compared to how they were just 10, 15 years ago when I would go, is night and day.
[01:15:39.316 --> 01:15:41.179]  When I was a kid, the park rangers were so cool.
[01:15:42.791 --> 01:15:45.535]  And would help you and tell you cool stories.
[01:15:45.595 --> 01:15:48.399]  And now, I mean, it's just disgusting.
[01:15:48.439 --> 01:15:48.759]  There it is.
[01:15:49.059 --> 01:15:52.224]  National Park Rangers ordered to keep visitors out of privately run businesses.
[01:15:52.764 --> 01:15:54.967]  And they go on to say it is disgusting.
[01:15:55.248 --> 01:15:59.774]  And that they've been, quote, ordered, the headline is, ordered to make it uncomfortable.
[01:16:01.229 --> 01:16:02.731]  I've got so much news, folks.
[01:16:02.852 --> 01:16:13.468]  Obama is holding the country hostage now, going out and giving a speech last Thursday, making statements yesterday that we're going to default if they don't raise the debt limit or they keep the government shut down.
[01:16:14.009 --> 01:16:15.551]  Which, of course, when the president
[01:16:16.408 --> 01:16:18.670]  Starts talking about defaults and bad markets.
[01:16:18.750 --> 01:16:20.791]  Of course the stock market went down today.
[01:16:21.071 --> 01:16:22.252]  Stock markets went down everywhere.
[01:16:22.572 --> 01:16:26.976]  And then he says, see I told you so, when he's the one signaling it.
[01:16:27.496 --> 01:16:28.877]  Outrageous!
[01:16:29.758 --> 01:16:32.720]  They are threatening to scuttle everything if we don't give them what they want.
[01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:33.440]  But here's the deal.
[01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:34.721]  They're gonna scuttle it anyways.
[01:16:34.881 --> 01:16:36.122]  They're gonna wreck us anyways.
[01:16:36.462 --> 01:16:39.184]  So all we gotta do is say, go ahead you little terrorist.
[01:16:39.625 --> 01:16:42.607]  Go ahead and shut down whatever you want, scum!
[01:16:45.765 --> 01:16:57.447]  You ever been in a relationship where somebody says who you thought was nice, and they get really nasty and they threaten you?
[01:16:58.787 --> 01:17:00.768]  And that's when the relationship's over for good with me.
[01:17:00.828 --> 01:17:01.068]  Bam.
[01:17:01.628 --> 01:17:01.908]  Boom.
[01:17:01.948 --> 01:17:02.308]  It's over.
[01:17:02.328 --> 01:17:09.730]  I mean, I had a couple girlfriends out of many people I dated.
[01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:11.770]  It was always when you were really serious with somebody.
[01:17:13.235 --> 01:17:17.676]  And repeatedly, it's like, if you leave me, I'm gonna call the police on you and say you're beating me.
[01:17:17.836 --> 01:17:18.716]  I had that happen twice.
[01:17:19.616 --> 01:17:25.277]  And I went, you're the person that punches me, and that's why I don't like this, and claws at me and stuff, and throws things at me.
[01:17:25.937 --> 01:17:30.938]  I'm, I am, you know, don't come over to my house anymore or my apartment anymore.
[01:17:33.079 --> 01:17:38.220]  And when someone tries to hold you hostage, it just absolutely makes you angry.
[01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:40.100]  So I'm like, good, call him, you liar!
[01:17:41.892 --> 01:17:46.454]  And the point is, is that this is what this is like, but I can't leave Obama.
[01:17:46.854 --> 01:17:48.335]  I can't get the government out of my life.
[01:17:48.395 --> 01:17:49.515]  I can't get them off my back.
[01:17:50.736 --> 01:17:53.237]  I mean, if some restaurant gives you bad service, you don't go back there.
[01:17:53.637 --> 01:17:58.599]  If some company cheats you, you don't do business again, and you speak out against them, give them bad word of mouth.
[01:18:01.740 --> 01:18:04.941]  But, I mean, the New World Order is, I can't get it out of my life.
[01:18:05.802 --> 01:18:07.022]  And I know you're sick of it, too.
[01:18:07.082 --> 01:18:08.243]  You can't get them out of your life.
[01:18:09.305 --> 01:18:16.849]  And that's the feeling of being trapped with this abusive relationship with these people that live off of us and then treat us like garbage.
[01:18:17.169 --> 01:18:22.792]  At the same time, we're going exactly through what our founders went through and so many other cultures went through.
[01:18:22.812 --> 01:18:24.012]  It's called slavery, folks.
[01:18:24.672 --> 01:18:28.894]  Just like black people being slaves in this country or Europeans being feudal serf slaves.
[01:18:29.755 --> 01:18:36.218]  Or in the Navy, the British, the French, all the major navies of Europe went and grabbed men and children off the street.
[01:18:37.284 --> 01:18:38.425]  And they called it impressment.
[01:18:38.725 --> 01:18:40.206]  Because it's illegal to have a white slave.
[01:18:40.426 --> 01:18:43.588]  You just chain them up and beat them if they don't do the work you want.
[01:18:43.888 --> 01:18:45.169]  Cat or Ninetales, same deal.
[01:18:46.510 --> 01:18:47.671]  I mean, they were doing impressment.
[01:18:47.971 --> 01:18:49.472]  When did England get rid of impressment?
[01:18:49.793 --> 01:18:51.754]  I think it was in 1812, I think.
[01:18:51.774 --> 01:18:55.497]  Because another war happened with England partially over that.
[01:18:55.517 --> 01:18:56.258]  The War of 1812.
[01:18:57.459 --> 01:18:59.160]  And I think England got rid of impressment in 1812.
[01:18:59.641 --> 01:19:00.301]  Let's look it up.
[01:19:00.582 --> 01:19:01.763]  But what do you think the draft is?
[01:19:02.083 --> 01:19:03.284]  That's another form of impressment.
[01:19:03.844 --> 01:19:06.086]  But we put up with it if a foreign enemy is attacking us.
[01:19:06.346 --> 01:19:07.267]  Well, we've got to do this.
[01:19:07.567 --> 01:19:08.648]  You shouldn't have to be drafted.
[01:19:08.668 --> 01:19:09.369]  You should go join.
[01:19:10.310 --> 01:19:10.650]  You see?
[01:19:11.991 --> 01:19:15.133]  But the elites never want to be part of the fighting once...
[01:19:16.311 --> 01:19:17.212]  You have a corrupt system.
[01:19:17.973 --> 01:19:23.458]  In the old days, people wouldn't go to war unless the king saddled up at the head of the troops, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:19:23.718 --> 01:19:26.241]  Plus, it was the form of entertainment to be in war.
[01:19:26.301 --> 01:19:27.482]  Those were real men back then.
[01:19:27.502 --> 01:19:28.703]  They wanted to go be in a fight.
[01:19:28.983 --> 01:19:31.886]  I mean, you wanted to go start wars just so they could go kill each other.
[01:19:33.307 --> 01:19:34.829]  But see, now we have fluoride in our water.
[01:19:34.869 --> 01:19:37.692]  Maybe that argument is that it's good for us that they've dumbed us down.
[01:19:38.936 --> 01:19:45.063]  There you go, the impressment of seamen from American ships caused serious tensions between Britain and the United States in the years leading up to the War of 1812.
[01:19:45.744 --> 01:19:50.669]  And after the defeat of Napoleon in 1814, Britain ended the practice and never resumed it.
[01:19:50.970 --> 01:19:52.932]  But they really officially ended it in 1814.
[01:19:53.352 --> 01:19:59.439]  But there were so many riots over impressment in London, and dads going crazy when their 10-year-old got grabbed up the front porch.
[01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:01.664]  My point is, it's the same deal.
[01:20:01.744 --> 01:20:02.687]  Get off our backs.
[01:20:02.947 --> 01:20:03.950]  You don't own us.
[01:20:04.351 --> 01:20:06.055]  We're awake and we're tired of it.
[01:20:06.296 --> 01:20:07.539]  I'm not your slave.
[01:20:07.559 --> 01:20:09.123]  Get it through your head.
[01:20:09.969 --> 01:20:15.071]  Alex Jones here, and I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show, My Patriot Supply.
[01:20:15.431 --> 01:20:23.893]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[01:20:24.313 --> 01:20:31.596]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow Patriots.
[01:20:32.136 --> 01:20:39.538]  My Patriot Supply brings us their exclusive Patriot Pantry brand, along with many other fine preparedness products.

[01:21:09.361 --> 01:21:14.385]  We travel so much, and having a fake TV, well, it gives added peace of mind.
[01:21:14.545 --> 01:21:17.668]  Burglars look for houses that appear to be easy targets.
[01:21:18.048 --> 01:21:24.073]  But fake TV can fool even professional burglars into thinking someone is home watching television.
[01:21:24.173 --> 01:21:36.123]  As a recent widow living alone, it gives me great peace of mind to set my fake TV near a window and know that passing motorists and pedestrians will think someone is home watching TV when I'm actually away from home.
[01:21:36.423 --> 01:21:40.806]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet just like a light on a timer.
[01:21:40.986 --> 01:21:42.567]  And they're so easy to use.
[01:21:42.787 --> 01:21:44.689]  You just plug them in and they're ready to go.
[01:21:44.709 --> 01:21:48.431]  Plus, they're so affordable that we have one upstairs and downstairs.
[01:21:48.711 --> 01:21:51.873]  Fake TV is only $29.95 with free shipping.

[01:23:08.579 --> 01:23:17.787]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit and carting to a private bank, having it lent back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[01:23:17.887 --> 01:23:18.608]  This capitalism?
[01:23:18.668 --> 01:23:24.773]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:23:24.833 --> 01:23:28.476]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[01:23:28.536 --> 01:23:29.457]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.

[01:23:31.179 --> 01:23:31.459]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:23:39.369 --> 01:23:46.994]  That's the sound of a .44 Magnum and TraumaMaxx, a high-tech hybrid Kevlar bulletproof vest from InfidelBodyArmor.com.

[01:24:17.985 --> 01:24:29.534]  Did a bad, bad thing.
[01:24:30.095 --> 01:24:35.840]  Yeah, it's called Obamacare.
[01:24:35.980 --> 01:24:37.281]  It's called putting fluoride in the water.
[01:24:38.362 --> 01:24:40.824]  It's called putting cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[01:24:45.083 --> 01:24:47.668]  Well, no, I don't love the New World Order, and I wish they were off my back.
[01:24:49.331 --> 01:24:52.737]  I don't want them to be here abusing me, I want them out of my life.
[01:24:52.957 --> 01:24:54.300]  Off the planet, preferably.
[01:24:55.983 --> 01:24:57.986]  On a deserted island with themselves.
[01:24:59.909 --> 01:25:02.331]  I'm trying to find my stack that I said I was going to mention.
[01:25:02.351 --> 01:25:03.532]  I'm going to your calls right now.
[01:25:04.292 --> 01:25:11.298]  I have a whole stack of persecution of the press and persecution of people for their religious beliefs.
[01:25:11.858 --> 01:25:12.539]  I'm going to get to that.
[01:25:12.579 --> 01:25:13.520]  I'm going to find that.
[01:25:14.060 --> 01:25:24.908]  But the reason I raise it is it has the new ATF book about Fast and Furious where they're threatening to not let the book come out and even talking about prosecuting people if they release that it was premeditated.
[01:25:25.589 --> 01:25:26.290]  Hey Alex, can you hear me?
[01:25:26.310 --> 01:25:27.130]  Alright, I have a couple questions.
[01:25:27.150 --> 01:25:29.212]  Did you see anything about the new republic?
[01:25:53.456 --> 01:26:02.306]  Obama talking about dissolving Congress here in the next couple weeks if they don't solve this debt ceiling thing.
[01:26:02.386 --> 01:26:05.809]  I'll ask you the other question if you want to...
[01:26:12.523 --> 01:26:15.204]  Yeah, there's two or three of them online there.
[01:26:15.244 --> 01:26:17.225]  I just found it to get myself.
[01:26:17.586 --> 01:26:20.527]  Well, I haven't seen that yet, but that sounds like something they do.
[01:26:20.567 --> 01:26:24.449]  I mean, they've said before, if Congress won't act on guns, we'll just do it.
[01:26:24.509 --> 01:26:27.411]  Or if Congress won't let us attack a country, we'll just do it.
[01:26:28.031 --> 01:26:30.352]  It's all part of the ongoing power grabbing that's happening.
[01:26:31.153 --> 01:26:41.158]  I guess that happened about 20 years ago in Russia, actually, where they actually even turned guns on the building because
[01:26:42.563 --> 01:26:46.065]  The Congress and everything were refusing to leave.
[01:26:46.385 --> 01:26:46.525]  Yeah.
[01:26:46.565 --> 01:26:48.046]  And Boris Yeltsin on top of the tanks.
[01:26:58.393 --> 01:27:05.776]  Kicking out the old Politburo Duma communists that were ignoring the election.
[01:27:06.076 --> 01:27:06.856]  It's the opposite.
[01:27:07.296 --> 01:27:08.577]  And I'm not calling for this.
[01:27:09.237 --> 01:27:11.097]  I mean, it's grand juries need to do it.
[01:27:11.117 --> 01:27:12.338]  Of course, they'll kill whoever tries it.
[01:27:13.258 --> 01:27:16.299]  You should have Obama and his cohorts should be arrested.
[01:27:16.799 --> 01:27:21.461]  The problem is that all the corruption comes down and the power structure doesn't want that.
[01:27:21.561 --> 01:27:24.102]  But they're going to have to do it at some point because
[01:27:25.461 --> 01:27:29.162]  Tyranny will wreck everything, even the good deal the criminals have going.
[01:27:30.282 --> 01:27:33.482]  Criminals always eat through the hull of the ship and then the whole thing sinks.
[01:27:34.683 --> 01:27:36.023]  And that's basically what's happening.
[01:27:36.043 --> 01:27:36.803]  But we'll check that.
[01:27:36.983 --> 01:27:37.903]  That's New Republic.
[01:27:37.963 --> 01:27:38.883]  And what was the headline?
[01:27:38.903 --> 01:27:40.904]  We're going to look it up.
[01:27:41.724 --> 01:27:43.744]  Obama should dissolve Congress.
[01:27:44.664 --> 01:27:47.845]  Obama should dissolve Congress.
[01:27:47.905 --> 01:27:48.805]  All right, I'll look that up.
[01:27:50.905 --> 01:27:54.226]  And I guess that'd be in the news function, folks, if you want to look for it that way.
[01:27:54.366 --> 01:27:54.646]  Go ahead.
[01:27:55.632 --> 01:28:11.421]  I ran into this a couple of times in the last two weeks, and before that I'd never even heard of it, but do you know anything about the, I'm going to say Cook Brothers, K-O-C-H, and how they relate to the Tea Party?
[01:28:13.282 --> 01:28:14.022]  Say that again, sir.
[01:28:14.062 --> 01:28:14.743]  I wasn't ignoring you.
[01:28:14.763 --> 01:28:17.284]  I was pulling up the article here, what you're talking about.
[01:28:17.584 --> 01:28:18.084]  Say that again.
[01:28:18.205 --> 01:28:18.425]  Yeah.
[01:28:18.965 --> 01:28:23.788]  I ran into this a couple of times in the last two weeks, and before that I'd never even heard of it.
[01:28:24.864 --> 01:28:25.704]  The Koch Brothers?
[01:28:25.905 --> 01:28:27.085]  K-O-C-H?
[01:28:27.906 --> 01:28:30.107]  And how they relate to the Tea Party?
[01:28:30.307 --> 01:28:32.048]  Oh, you're talking about the Koch Brothers.
[01:28:32.088 --> 01:28:38.031]  Yeah, the Koch Brothers have funded the Democrats as well as the Republicans.
[01:28:38.951 --> 01:28:40.912]  And they're just basically apolitical.
[01:28:41.692 --> 01:28:42.993]  But they're not complete communists.
[01:28:43.113 --> 01:28:47.936]  And they own their own big empire in oil and gas and plastic and paper and you name it.
[01:28:47.956 --> 01:28:50.257]  And there's other mafias trying to muscle them out.
[01:28:50.777 --> 01:28:55.102]  But they've had their pipeline down to Texas shut down, which I'd like to have a pipeline.
[01:28:55.122 --> 01:28:58.626]  I'd like to have more oil from Canada instead of Saudi Arabia.
[01:28:58.686 --> 01:29:08.036]  But regardless, it becomes a political boogeyman for the controlled left to act like they're actually running everything when they're just part of it and part of the power structure.
[01:29:08.076 --> 01:29:09.478]  But they actually supported Bill Clinton.
[01:29:10.441 --> 01:29:12.384]  They were big supporters of Bill Clinton.
[01:29:12.404 --> 01:29:14.867]  They rode that train to fame and power.
[01:29:14.988 --> 01:29:20.696]  I mean, any big combine is going to be working in government to protect their interests but also shut down their competition.
[01:29:21.036 --> 01:29:24.581]  But of all the virulent forms of centralized mega-rich,
[01:29:26.102 --> 01:29:29.646]  They're on a scale of 1 to 10 of being inside operators.
[01:29:29.686 --> 01:29:30.226]  I'd make them about a 4.
[01:29:30.346 --> 01:29:32.569]  Whereas Warren Buffett's a 10.
[01:29:33.109 --> 01:29:34.210]  David Rockefeller's a 10.
[01:29:35.151 --> 01:29:35.912]  Lord Rothschild's a 10.
[01:29:36.172 --> 01:29:38.314]  I mean, they're in there driving the agenda.
[01:29:39.796 --> 01:29:42.438]  The globalists hate the Koch brothers because they're not for carbon taxes.
[01:29:43.559 --> 01:29:44.700]  Because that would hurt their business.
[01:29:45.381 --> 01:29:46.482]  I mean, it really comes down to that.
[01:29:46.722 --> 01:29:48.423]  And it gets even more sophisticated than that.
[01:29:48.884 --> 01:29:50.025]  But I hope that answers your question.
[01:29:50.065 --> 01:29:50.865]  But yeah, here it is!
[01:29:50.885 --> 01:29:55.109]  New Republic calling for Obama to dissolve Congress.

[01:30:00.313 --> 01:30:01.914]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:02.855 --> 01:30:05.538]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:31:19.954 --> 01:31:26.324]  Listen, there is some real scum in the alarm business cashing in by locking you into long, punishing contracts.

[01:33:31.910 --> 01:33:33.732]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:33.932 --> 01:33:35.993]  Oh, my little girl.
[01:33:36.053 --> 01:33:39.735]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:57.731 --> 01:34:00.592]  Broadcasting from Austin, Texas.
[01:34:02.913 --> 01:34:04.494]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[01:34:04.514 --> 01:34:06.715]  We're here Monday through Friday from 12 noon to 3 p.m.
[01:34:06.775 --> 01:34:07.075]  Eastern.
[01:34:07.475 --> 01:34:08.115]  That's 9 a.m.
[01:34:08.135 --> 01:34:09.336]  to 12 noon Pacific.
[01:34:10.376 --> 01:34:10.896]  10 a.m.
[01:34:10.916 --> 01:34:11.596]  to 1 p.m.
[01:34:11.696 --> 01:34:12.417]  Mountain.
[01:34:12.437 --> 01:34:12.617]  11 a.m.
[01:34:12.637 --> 01:34:13.317]  to 2 p.m.
[01:34:13.877 --> 01:34:14.318]  Central.
[01:34:14.778 --> 01:34:19.400]  And then of course we have the weeknight InfoWars Nightly News at InfoWarsNews.com.
[01:34:20.700 --> 01:34:34.764]  With myself and the rest of my great research team and anchors, and of course the great writers here in Austin, Texas and over in the UK, as well as many other great contributors, the news sites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:34:35.044 --> 01:34:37.265]  By the way, InfoWars is an eight-year-old design.
[01:34:37.385 --> 01:34:39.946]  Kurt Nimmo did a great job redesigning it eight years ago.
[01:34:40.766 --> 01:34:42.967]  He's working about 20 feet away from me right through that wall.
[01:34:43.847 --> 01:34:49.389]  But we are redesigning InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com to the latest design with all the latest functions.
[01:34:50.289 --> 01:34:52.531]  We're just always so busy doing other stuff, we never get around to it.
[01:34:52.791 --> 01:35:00.717]  We'll first have Prison Planet in the next couple weeks, beta testing something, and then we're going to move it over to InfoWars.com.
[01:35:01.598 --> 01:35:08.843]  And it basically looks like Time Magazine meets The London Guardian, so folks should certainly like that.
[01:35:08.863 --> 01:35:10.345]  Of course, the content's different.
[01:35:11.414 --> 01:35:15.556]  We're not, you know, having stuff about how great it is to euthanize old people or anything.
[01:35:16.296 --> 01:35:16.936]  We're not trendy.
[01:35:17.137 --> 01:35:18.237]  We're not humanitarians.
[01:35:18.577 --> 01:35:25.900]  We're not for killing innocent people and forced testing on the population and eugenics, so we're kind of bad folks.
[01:35:26.601 --> 01:35:35.985]  Speaking of that, ladies and gentlemen, nascent iodine, from all the scientists and medical doctors and nutritionists that I've talked to and that you've heard on air,
[01:35:37.173 --> 01:35:39.355]  It just keeps coming up that this is the stuff.
[01:35:39.655 --> 01:35:41.197]  And you can't find this in stores.
[01:35:42.178 --> 01:35:44.720]  It's something that's only really been rediscovered since the mid-90s.
[01:35:44.881 --> 01:35:48.884]  We're actually talking to the guy that repopularized it back in the mid-1990s.
[01:35:48.924 --> 01:35:50.266]  We're going to have him on soon.
[01:35:50.806 --> 01:35:54.109]  Because this is the atomic form of iodine.
[01:35:55.163 --> 01:35:56.905]  By atomic, it's not radioactive.
[01:35:56.945 --> 01:36:03.310]  It is on the periodic table or on the breakdown of minerals and things the body needs.
[01:36:03.611 --> 01:36:04.211]  It is pure.
[01:36:05.012 --> 01:36:11.178]  It is the actual elemental form, not something made artificially in a laboratory.
[01:36:11.738 --> 01:36:12.038]  Okay.
[01:36:12.419 --> 01:36:15.901]  You know, I mean, regular iodine, you put it on something, it'll rust through metal, basically.
[01:36:15.921 --> 01:36:16.741]  This doesn't do that.
[01:36:16.762 --> 01:36:17.782]  This is real iodine.
[01:36:18.062 --> 01:36:19.683]  We have double strength at half the cost.
[01:36:20.124 --> 01:36:20.864]  Infowars.
[01:36:21.505 --> 01:36:25.027]  Store.com to find the modified seaweed that also has it naturally in it.
[01:36:25.748 --> 01:36:26.748]  But not as powerful as this.
[01:36:26.928 --> 01:36:28.009]  I've been taking it for over a month.
[01:36:28.369 --> 01:36:29.530]  Unbelievable.
[01:36:30.391 --> 01:36:32.252]  Unbelievable the amount of energy I've got.
[01:36:32.392 --> 01:36:34.393]  Unbelievable the amount of weight I'm losing.
[01:36:34.794 --> 01:36:36.475]  Unbelievable how crazed I am.
[01:36:37.608 --> 01:36:38.729]  Everyone can attest to it.
[01:36:39.390 --> 01:36:41.893]  And I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm like, oh, yeah, right.
[01:36:41.934 --> 01:36:43.195]  This is going to do something months ago.
[01:36:43.275 --> 01:36:46.539]  And Gucci Arty and others and Dr. Group told me how great it was.
[01:36:46.679 --> 01:36:48.141]  And it is awesome.
[01:36:48.902 --> 01:36:49.803]  For me, it's amazing.
[01:36:50.064 --> 01:36:52.166]  Go look at details, links to all the info.
[01:36:52.567 --> 01:36:54.730]  Infowarslife.com or infowarsstore.com.
[01:36:55.931 --> 01:37:00.214]  We also have some other great seaweed products at InfoWarsHealth.com.
[01:37:00.554 --> 01:37:05.398]  But to find this, InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:37:05.538 --> 01:37:08.760]  And there's also the amount of file in there as well.
[01:37:08.820 --> 01:37:11.061]  Now, he's going to be with us for the rest of the hour.
[01:37:12.282 --> 01:37:18.406]  And then we're going to have John McAfee on for about 30 minutes and then I'll go to your calls.
[01:37:18.446 --> 01:37:19.207]  I know people are holding.
[01:37:21.599 --> 01:37:23.500]  And Dylan, that's not a pun.
[01:37:23.560 --> 01:37:26.021]  I actually have Bob and Dylan is next in line after him.
[01:37:26.321 --> 01:37:27.261]  I wish it was Bob Dylan.
[01:37:28.682 --> 01:37:30.343]  But I'm happy to talk to Bob and Dylan.
[01:37:30.363 --> 01:37:36.165]  And then we'll talk to, what ridiculous puns I'm doing, Mark and Randall and Kerry.
[01:37:36.185 --> 01:37:37.105]  I'll get to all of you.
[01:37:37.126 --> 01:37:38.206]  So thank you for being patient.
[01:37:38.726 --> 01:37:40.187]  We're going to be getting to you here today.
[01:37:41.087 --> 01:37:42.568]  You know, it sounds like I'm in a good mood.
[01:37:44.855 --> 01:37:51.140]  I'm just committed to fighting tyranny, and I'm just happy I'm awake and know what's happening, and that I'm effective at trying to make things better.
[01:37:52.041 --> 01:37:53.242]  And I'm living a fulfilled life.
[01:37:54.503 --> 01:37:56.105]  I'm not going to let the globalists get me down.
[01:37:56.865 --> 01:37:57.486]  I'm going to beat them.
[01:37:57.966 --> 01:38:00.729]  And that's the attitude you need to have, and I know a lot of you do have that attitude.
[01:38:00.989 --> 01:38:04.752]  These people have jumped the collective shark, and they're out of control.
[01:38:04.972 --> 01:38:12.018]  In fact, I found the stack of news that I had that I'll get into with our guest about the persecution of the press and the government and the media.
[01:38:12.919 --> 01:38:16.760]  Most people in the federal government are actually awake and aren't that bad, actually, from the numbers I've seen.
[01:38:17.420 --> 01:38:19.340]  They are just absolutely under a reign of terror.
[01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:23.221]  And the globalists, I think, have miscalculated with all this abuse.
[01:38:23.961 --> 01:38:26.222]  The tighter they squeeze, the more people are going to wake up.
[01:38:26.762 --> 01:38:27.982]  We're going to get into all of that.
[01:38:28.082 --> 01:38:36.784]  I wanted to get Michael Bolden on, the founder and director of the Tenth Amendment Center, because they do a lot of great work, and we've interviewed his folks before.
[01:38:36.804 --> 01:38:37.884]  TenthAmendmentCenter.com.
[01:38:40.098 --> 01:38:42.579]  Because it really is about states' rights.
[01:38:43.399 --> 01:38:45.280]  Sure enough, a caller called in, Free Republic.
[01:38:46.480 --> 01:38:48.581]  Free Republic's a great online website.
[01:38:48.881 --> 01:38:52.662]  New Republic is the socialist establishment, New World Order, trendy crowd.
[01:38:52.682 --> 01:39:01.845]  And the magazine, they did actually come out with an article calling for Obama to basically attack Congress like Boris Yeltsin attacked the Russian Parliament.
[01:39:03.345 --> 01:39:04.746]  And I guess blow it up.
[01:39:06.799 --> 01:39:14.424]  It's two Russians walk into a parliamentary crisis, and then it's got a big image of Yeltsin, and they say that's the way to handle it.
[01:39:15.424 --> 01:39:17.846]  Just have Obama take over.
[01:39:19.187 --> 01:39:23.389]  So, and he keeps saying, you know, if Congress wasn't there, I could get this stuff done.
[01:39:23.409 --> 01:39:27.812]  And then Watchdog.org says, did the New Republic call for Obama to dissolve Congress?
[01:39:29.033 --> 01:39:30.854]  Apparently, that is what the New Republic
[01:39:31.869 --> 01:39:49.633]  She thinks about our old republic in a post-Wednesday afternoon, Julie Awful, Julie Eye-Off, I think they say it, but she is an awful person, made a not-so-subtle suggestion about how she thinks the chief executive should handle opposition from democratically elected legislatures.
[01:39:50.193 --> 01:39:53.354]  She goes in showing the parliament blown up.
[01:39:54.154 --> 01:39:54.755]  On fire!
[01:39:55.215 --> 01:39:55.696]  Wow!
[01:39:56.236 --> 01:39:57.498]  And it's a serious article.
[01:39:57.878 --> 01:40:00.220]  I mean, these people are authoritarian fruits.
[01:40:00.861 --> 01:40:04.564]  By the way, they already tell us that the states don't even exist.
[01:40:04.584 --> 01:40:05.525]  They're not even in the schedule.
[01:40:05.565 --> 01:40:06.286]  They never mattered.
[01:40:07.247 --> 01:40:11.992]  I mean, states have no rights but to be toilet paper for the executive run by foreign banks.
[01:40:12.212 --> 01:40:15.255]  Well, now they're saying the Congress shouldn't even be there.
[01:40:16.144 --> 01:40:23.008]  Mommy, is it true that once there was a three branches of government and not our Supreme Leader, Kim Jong-un, the 19th?
[01:40:23.548 --> 01:40:24.949]  Honey, that's a thought crime.
[01:40:25.349 --> 01:40:26.810]  The monitor systems picked it up.
[01:40:26.850 --> 01:40:28.190]  You'll be sent for re-education.
[01:40:31.452 --> 01:40:42.037]  By the way, I didn't know that... Grothjohn... You know, I'm gonna get to that later.
[01:40:42.057 --> 01:40:43.498]  I'm having one of those moments.
[01:40:43.938 --> 01:40:44.819]  Larry Grafwald...
[01:40:45.910 --> 01:40:47.814]  No, it's Larry Grafwald.
[01:40:48.535 --> 01:40:50.038]  Last night, Dew called me.
[01:40:51.541 --> 01:40:52.704]  At about 8 o'clock at night.
[01:40:54.016 --> 01:40:56.797]  And said, hey, you want to get Larry Graffald back on the show?
[01:40:56.817 --> 01:41:06.199]  He's the guy that, the special forces guy that blew the whistle on the weather underground, wanting to put 50 million Americans in forced labor and kill 25 million of us and it all came out in federal court and all their documents, their plans.
[01:41:06.419 --> 01:41:13.321]  I said, I want to get him on for Obama deception too, now that I'm extending it out and I'm going to release it early next year.
[01:41:13.341 --> 01:41:15.622]  I have a little bit more time and he's dead.
[01:41:18.544 --> 01:41:19.985]  And I was trying to, like, pull up the name.
[01:41:20.025 --> 01:41:21.305]  It's Larry Grafwald.
[01:41:21.505 --> 01:41:29.709]  You know, he's the guy that famously... He's the guy that famously... Yeah, blew the whistle on Bill Ayers and all the rest of it.
[01:41:30.109 --> 01:41:31.630]  And he reportedly died last summer.
[01:41:31.650 --> 01:41:32.450]  I don't even know about it.
[01:41:33.431 --> 01:41:34.811]  Again, folks, this is teleprompter free.
[01:41:34.851 --> 01:41:35.592]  I'm, like, here on air.
[01:41:35.612 --> 01:41:37.032]  I got a guest holding waiting to come on.
[01:41:37.052 --> 01:41:40.114]  And I've just got stuff popping into my head that I'd forgotten about.
[01:41:40.154 --> 01:41:42.835]  This is the opposite of calculated radio.
[01:41:42.855 --> 01:41:43.695]  You need to understand that.
[01:41:44.596 --> 01:41:46.456]  And then I feel the loss again, realizing he's dead.
[01:41:49.485 --> 01:41:51.354]  I think we interviewed him shortly before he died.
[01:41:51.394 --> 01:41:53.765]  We need to dig that up, re-air that on the nightly news.
[01:41:55.117 --> 01:42:00.758]  Because he talked about how their real plan is, all they ever talk about is how they want to kill everybody and take over and take our kids.
[01:42:00.818 --> 01:42:14.121]  And I've been with communists, high-level ones before, who I didn't know were communists, you know, well-known socialists and people, who off-record think I'm their buddy, because back during the Bush years, and go, you know, we're not going to kill you when we take over.
[01:42:14.141 --> 01:42:14.881]  And I'm like, you're joking.
[01:42:15.142 --> 01:42:17.282]  No, the plan is we're going to murder, apply, we want to kill people.
[01:42:17.322 --> 01:42:21.583]  And I'm like, and it's like every time I go have a beer with them, they start talking about killing everybody.
[01:42:22.622 --> 01:42:24.403]  And I'm like, ooh, I mean, it's really creepy.
[01:42:24.904 --> 01:42:26.365]  I'm like, well, I don't want to kill people.
[01:42:26.405 --> 01:42:29.066]  I'm not a... You're a libertarian communist, is what they'll tell me.
[01:42:29.107 --> 01:42:31.588]  I'm like, what the... It's just bizarre.
[01:42:31.768 --> 01:42:32.689]  Anyways, I'm gonna shut up.
[01:42:33.550 --> 01:42:36.131]  Michael Bolden, Tenth Amendment Center, dot com.
[01:42:36.332 --> 01:42:38.453]  Hey, forget what you're saying, states' rights.
[01:42:39.434 --> 01:42:41.815]  The New Republic just says blow up the Congress.
[01:42:41.835 --> 01:42:42.416]  How's that sound?
[01:42:42.918 --> 01:42:51.684]  Well, Congress has been a rubber stamp for a long time, Alex, whether it's been a Bush or a Clinton or an Obama in office, and they don't want us to know that we actually have power.
[01:42:52.025 --> 01:42:57.148]  We have powers as individuals in our communities and in our states to actually make something happen.
[01:42:57.449 --> 01:43:03.133]  That's why I was so excited to see Julie Wilson's report on your site last week talking about what happened here in California.
[01:43:03.553 --> 01:43:07.876]  VISA V, indefinite detention under the National Defense Authorization Act.
[01:43:07.916 --> 01:43:14.201]  That is the power the government claims to be able to snatch anybody off the street if they claim that you're an enemy.
[01:43:14.481 --> 01:43:17.263]  In other words, government-sanctioned kidnapping.
[01:43:17.624 --> 01:43:21.327]  You don't get access to a lawyer, no trial, no court, no nothing.
[01:43:21.387 --> 01:43:23.088]  If they don't like you, it's V for Vendetta.
[01:43:23.348 --> 01:43:24.388]  We're good to go.
[01:43:43.820 --> 01:43:51.868]  Break down what this country was founded on versus the authoritarians that say no, all power flows out of the Chief Executive.
[01:43:52.369 --> 01:43:53.790]  Well we can do an exact 180.
[01:43:54.911 --> 01:43:57.614]  What we have today is totally opposite.
[01:43:57.834 --> 01:44:05.662]  That whenever there's something wrong, we go to the Federal Imperial Congress or the Imperial Executive to tell us how to fix things.
[01:44:06.182 --> 01:44:08.623]  Every single thing, they want us to go to them.
[01:44:08.923 --> 01:44:16.707]  But the truth of the matter is, as James Madison wrote in Federalist 45, the powers delegated to the federal government are, quote, few and defiant.
[01:44:16.947 --> 01:44:19.688]  And those reserved to the states are numerous and indefinite.
[01:44:19.728 --> 01:44:24.471]  The people of the states are supposed to have the power to do whatever they want, basically.
[01:44:24.511 --> 01:44:26.692]  I mean, set up their society the way they want.
[01:44:26.772 --> 01:44:29.453]  This is the only system where you can have a huge number of
[01:44:29.873 --> 01:44:30.073]  I think?
[01:44:54.386 --> 01:44:57.249]  We need to learn how to live free whether they want us to or not.
[01:44:57.330 --> 01:45:00.213]  But you know what, Michael Bolton of the Tenth Amendment Center?
[01:45:00.553 --> 01:45:03.076]  I don't need to be intellectual to debate with you.
[01:45:03.116 --> 01:45:09.023]  I can be like those Obama supporters in the Mark Dice videos that don't even know what party he's in.
[01:45:09.463 --> 01:45:11.345]  All I've got to do is call you racist.
[01:45:12.006 --> 01:45:14.647]  And then that makes me intellectually superior to you.
[01:45:14.907 --> 01:45:22.189]  It doesn't matter if you've said nothing about race, and you're actually for liberty and freedom for all, and for individual empowerment.
[01:45:22.450 --> 01:45:22.990]  It doesn't matter.
[01:45:23.110 --> 01:45:25.911]  I'm going to call you a racist right now, and now I'm better than you.
[01:45:26.411 --> 01:45:32.953]  Well, and this is what they've been doing, the Southern Poverty Law Center, who I know you've documented for many years, these crooks and criminals and liars.
[01:45:33.273 --> 01:45:38.075]  They named me one of the 25 racist radical leaders of the right in the last couple of years ago.
[01:45:38.715 --> 01:45:40.096]  Racist, yes.
[01:45:40.597 --> 01:45:42.639]  I guess I've been told this is a badge of honor.
[01:45:42.719 --> 01:45:45.481]  If they call you out, you're obviously doing something good.
[01:45:45.501 --> 01:45:47.503]  But the whole point is we're the opposite of race.
[01:45:47.563 --> 01:45:48.464]  I follow your work.
[01:45:48.544 --> 01:45:51.146]  Everybody, they've said Ron Paul's a racist and all this stuff.
[01:45:51.626 --> 01:45:59.534]  But with him, at least there was some vague newsletter when he had like 14 brands out, you know, like two articles out of 5,000 that they could claim was something.
[01:46:00.214 --> 01:46:06.860]  I mean, this is getting insane where they'll use comments on my website as proof by some anonymous commenter.
[01:46:07.441 --> 01:46:12.125]  Or have MSNBC say I'm deeply racist and behind the Boston bombing with no proof!
[01:46:12.525 --> 01:46:14.207]  I mean, it really shows a desperateness.
[01:46:15.031 --> 01:46:19.193]  Well, here at the 10th Amendment Center, unlike you, we act like with a freight train mentality.
[01:46:19.473 --> 01:46:27.237]  No matter what they throw at us, we're not going to get distracted by their garbage because their goal is to distract us in this little petty debate over who's racist and who's not.
[01:46:27.297 --> 01:46:27.777]  Oh, no, no, no.
[01:46:27.917 --> 01:46:28.277]  I agree.
[01:46:28.377 --> 01:46:38.402]  I'm only bringing it up to show what amoral, lawless, bankrupt, intellectually really bad, nasty race pimps they are.
[01:46:38.462 --> 01:46:40.163]  I mean, they're what they're accusing us of.
[01:46:40.734 --> 01:46:57.029]  Sure, and it's harder and harder for them to do that as we talk about the success of a left-right coalition in California to pass Assembly Bill 351, rejecting the policy of indefinite... Yeah, that's why we got you back, because they want to divide us along left and right, instead of all Americans should be against secret arrest.
[01:46:57.569 --> 01:46:59.070]  Certainly, kidnapping is bad.
[01:46:59.190 --> 01:47:00.031]  Murder is bad.
[01:47:00.591 --> 01:47:02.833]  Unconstitutional, undeclared wars is bad.
[01:47:02.953 --> 01:47:06.535]  It's very hard for them to call us that the more we get this out.
[01:47:06.575 --> 01:47:22.747]  But certainly, as AB 351 was signed by Jerry Brown, I mean, you don't expect anything good to come out of California, but it did because of a massive left-right coalition between Tea Party and Occupy, ACLU, Tenth Amendment Center, Oath Keepers, all across the board.
[01:47:22.987 --> 01:47:24.188]  There's no way to resist that.
[01:47:24.228 --> 01:47:26.910]  When you get enough people standing up and saying, we want to say no,
[01:47:27.370 --> 01:47:28.090]  It's going to happen.
[01:47:30.832 --> 01:47:33.333]  Well, again, I'm not going to debate the federal takeover.
[01:47:33.353 --> 01:47:37.254]  I'm just going to say that you're probably a bad man and probably an extremist.
[01:47:38.863 --> 01:47:41.966]  And that I'm more intellectual than you because I'm an idiot.
[01:47:42.406 --> 01:47:43.807]  Well, that's the attitude they throw at us.
[01:47:43.847 --> 01:47:46.610]  And when Bush was in office, I'll tell you, our organization started in 2006.
[01:47:47.050 --> 01:47:53.656]  And when Bush was in office, we used to get called by neocons, hey, you communists, go back to Cuba, because we were opposing federal power.
[01:47:53.676 --> 01:47:54.096]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:47:54.156 --> 01:47:56.678]  Whoever's in power, the right always calls you a communist.
[01:47:56.698 --> 01:47:57.399]  That's what they call me.
[01:47:57.419 --> 01:48:00.502]  The establishment neocon right called me a hardcore commie.
[01:48:01.022 --> 01:48:04.225]  And then as soon as the Democrats come in, I'm now a racist, fascist.
[01:48:04.305 --> 01:48:04.725]  Exactly.
[01:48:05.686 --> 01:48:21.064]  I went to your event here in Los Angeles a number of years ago when you hosted that event and you know back then the neocons hated you now they're starting to learn and I think the goal in these type of situations is every time the the power changes hands from one side of the other we keep bringing a few more people from the
[01:48:21.164 --> 01:48:25.487]  I was about to say, this isn't working like it used to, except for the dumbest people on the left and right.
[01:48:25.747 --> 01:48:33.751]  You're talking about my big 9-11 event with a couple thousand people at it, all these top scientists, people like Dr. Bob Bowman, Charlie Sheen was there too.
[01:48:34.192 --> 01:48:39.315]  And the whole point is, is that yeah, that was called a hardcore communist event, when it was really a libertarian event.
[01:48:39.995 --> 01:48:40.155]  Right.
[01:48:40.275 --> 01:48:47.699]  I mean, and it brought so many different types of people together, and I think this is the message that you've been talking about when we talk about a Tenth Amendment Center, what Ron Paul has been talking about.
[01:48:47.819 --> 01:48:48.720]  Liberty is popular.
[01:48:48.780 --> 01:48:52.582]  You can reach people on single-issue coalitions like we did here in California.
[01:48:52.602 --> 01:49:00.126]  Human racism, black, hispanic, white, asian, old, young, jewish, german, palestinian, chinese, all together.
[01:49:00.166 --> 01:49:01.287]  This is hardcore racism.
[01:49:01.994 --> 01:49:04.956]  Well, James Madison wrote in Federalist Paper No.
[01:49:05.256 --> 01:49:10.218]  46 that we actually can succeed in pushing back against the federal government if we take four steps.
[01:49:10.539 --> 01:49:14.661]  Not in Congress, not in the federal courts, and not in the executive branch.
[01:49:14.961 --> 01:49:16.021]  Four steps in our state.
[01:49:16.061 --> 01:49:26.527]  We're supposed to repudiate, we're supposed to stand up and oppose federal actions, call on our governors to speak out against it, and then most importantly, the last two things, use state legislative devices to, quote,
[01:49:26.747 --> 01:49:29.768]  They refuse to cooperate with officers of the union.
[01:49:29.828 --> 01:49:31.288]  We need to start standing down.
[01:49:31.588 --> 01:49:35.129]  No longer allow our state and local officials to enforce federal gun control.
[01:49:35.169 --> 01:49:43.690]  And again, what the feds do, and I want to go over these solutions when we come back, what the feds themselves run by globalists do, so I just bypass that and say, look, they can have their federal argument all day.
[01:49:43.990 --> 01:49:45.910]  There is some jurisdiction in some issues.
[01:49:46.391 --> 01:49:49.791]  They're lying and claiming total jurisdiction when on record that's not the case.
[01:49:50.271 --> 01:49:53.272]  They're actually globalist foreign run by big banks that brag.
[01:49:54.292 --> 01:49:59.359]  They've pretty much conquered the federal government, so our redress is now in balance with the states.
[01:49:59.719 --> 01:50:01.822]  And if the states get out of control, then the feds come in.
[01:50:02.183 --> 01:50:04.366]  That's the give and take in the federalist system.
[01:50:04.846 --> 01:50:08.771]  But look at how the governor of Wisconsin, when they blocked
[01:50:09.710 --> 01:50:18.919]  Fishing docks and things that weren't even federally paid for or built, but are on federal land, boat launches, they've just removed the federal barricades and the feds had to back down.
[01:50:19.280 --> 01:50:20.781]  So that's why the states are there.
[01:50:21.121 --> 01:50:29.370]  Sure, if we just totally lay down, the feds will run over and become imperial, but they're trying this corporate board of, you will be assimilated, the opposite is happening.
[01:50:29.690 --> 01:50:30.831]  I'm seeing a huge awakening.
[01:50:30.851 --> 01:50:31.452]  Are you seeing that?
[01:50:32.052 --> 01:50:32.573]  Absolutely.
[01:50:32.673 --> 01:50:40.843]  This example in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and other places where people are just defying these federal orders to shut down parks, this is nullification in action.
[01:50:41.063 --> 01:50:46.790]  When enough people stand up and say no, they can't ram their laws, regulations, or mandates down our throats.
[01:50:47.090 --> 01:50:50.835]  But you know how I counter that, putting on the hat of a trendy intellectual authoritarian?
[01:50:51.551 --> 01:50:51.992]  RACIST!
[01:50:52.032 --> 01:50:52.452]  RACIST!
[01:50:52.492 --> 01:50:52.913]  RACIST!
[01:50:52.953 --> 01:50:53.353]  RACIST!
[01:50:53.393 --> 01:50:53.794]  RACIST!
[01:50:53.834 --> 01:50:54.214]  RACIST!
[01:50:54.254 --> 01:50:54.835]  Michael Bolton!
[01:50:55.195 --> 01:50:55.636]  RACIST!
[01:50:55.716 --> 01:50:55.956]  RACIST!
[01:50:55.976 --> 01:50:57.898]  I just want to show how intellectually bankrupt they are.
[01:50:58.118 --> 01:50:58.519]  RACIST!
[01:50:58.579 --> 01:50:58.959]  RACIST!
[01:50:59.640 --> 01:51:00.141]  RACIST!
[01:51:00.341 --> 01:51:00.681]  RACIST!
[01:51:00.721 --> 01:51:01.042]  RACIST!
[01:51:01.102 --> 01:51:01.422]  RACIST!
[01:51:01.442 --> 01:51:07.849]  We'll be right back, and we're going to get into the fact that they're calling him the new Abraham Lincoln, and again, saying he should blow up Congress.
[01:51:08.049 --> 01:51:09.010]  That's Obama, by the way.
[01:51:09.691 --> 01:51:14.635]  Wouldn't it be nice to have one product that replaces more than 10, saving you space, time, and money?

[01:53:10.245 --> 01:53:14.747]  And now, an important sponsored message for men only from GetEDSolutions.com.
[01:53:14.947 --> 01:53:22.950]  Men who were formerly taking ED medication are now reporting that a secret underground video has restored their male performance better than pills.
[01:53:23.271 --> 01:53:31.434]  These men say this secret underground video is bringing back the male performance and sensation they've been missing for years, and it's working better than pills.
[01:53:31.734 --> 01:53:32.935]  Things are so much better now.
[01:53:33.315 --> 01:53:35.576]  Everything kinda came back overnight.
[01:53:35.736 --> 01:53:38.197]  My girlfriend is very happy.
[01:53:38.317 --> 01:53:41.699]  I purchased your product yesterday, and it was fantastic.
[01:53:41.799 --> 01:53:45.441]  I have used your system for about three weeks, and I'm already seeing great results.
[01:53:45.701 --> 01:53:51.864]  The owner of this video has reported the overwhelming bandwidth costs may necessitate his taking this video down.

[01:54:22.318 --> 01:54:23.659]  John McAfee's coming up.
[01:54:24.879 --> 01:54:27.820]  Give us his take on the NSA and ways he says it can be frustrated.
[01:54:30.980 --> 01:54:36.162]  We're going back to Michael Bolden and I make the joke about the racist stuff because it's not a joke.
[01:54:36.682 --> 01:54:38.382]  It's very serious authoritarianism.
[01:54:39.882 --> 01:54:41.783]  The people doing it want to paralyze speech.
[01:54:42.894 --> 01:54:44.375]  And demonize the First Amendment.
[01:54:44.395 --> 01:54:46.296]  That's why they're banning the term brown bag.
[01:54:47.957 --> 01:54:50.878]  Folks, brown bag, I looked it up, has never had any connotation to race.
[01:54:50.898 --> 01:54:54.760]  It means cheap paper, the type of paper you use in groceries.
[01:54:55.901 --> 01:54:56.801]  That's what it means.
[01:54:57.122 --> 01:54:59.303]  It's very expensive to stain paper white.
[01:55:01.164 --> 01:55:03.585]  That's why people thought white bread a hundred years ago was fancy.
[01:55:06.223 --> 01:55:08.625]  Here is a white napkin I have, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:55:08.745 --> 01:55:11.327]  I will assure you this is not because I'm being racist.
[01:55:11.888 --> 01:55:14.930]  But again, this is the new mental illness they're trying to install.
[01:55:15.791 --> 01:55:20.735]  Shifting gears out of that, we've been hearing that Obama should just be the new Lincoln.
[01:55:20.775 --> 01:55:24.438]  They said this eight years ago when he was first running for office, two years out.
[01:55:24.458 --> 01:55:27.221]  When he was just exploratory.
[01:55:29.318 --> 01:55:36.385]  2006, 2007, that, oh, he'll be like the new Lincoln, and he'll crush the states, and he'll show anybody that tries to block him.
[01:55:36.866 --> 01:55:37.866]  They've really been...
[01:55:39.124 --> 01:55:43.267]  Spoiling for this fight, Michael Bolden, what are the solutions to counter this?
[01:55:43.347 --> 01:55:44.909]  What should we be doing at the state level?
[01:55:45.529 --> 01:55:49.132]  The solution is through following the Founding Fathers' advice.
[01:55:49.172 --> 01:55:57.999]  We've been talking a little bit about James Madison and his four steps, primarily using state or local legislative devices to refuse cooperation with officers of the Union.
[01:55:58.219 --> 01:55:59.000]  Check out this report.
[01:55:59.020 --> 01:56:01.542]  This is breaking news from Easton, Kansas.
[01:56:01.602 --> 01:56:02.923]  They just passed an ordinance
[01:56:03.383 --> 01:56:04.804]  Binding law in Eastern Kansas.
[01:56:05.144 --> 01:56:21.432]  No agency of the City of Eastern Kansas shall provide material support for or participate in any way in the enforcement of any act, law, treaty, order, rule, or regulation regarding personal firearms, firearm accessories, or ammunition within the boundary of the City of Eastern Kansas.
[01:56:21.692 --> 01:56:28.876]  You can take action on your county, your city, your town level to get an ordinance passed saying we're not going to abide by federal gun control measures.
[01:56:29.196 --> 01:56:32.658]  And Judge Andrew Napolitano was on, I think, Fox Business earlier this year.
[01:56:32.678 --> 01:56:43.064]  He said if a state would just stand down and not help the federal government carry this stuff out, it would make those laws, as Judge Knapp said, nearly impossible to enforce.
[01:56:43.105 --> 01:56:47.487]  And I'll sure take nearly impossible to enforce over what Obama and his gang want to do today.
[01:56:48.048 --> 01:56:48.208]  Well...
[01:56:49.468 --> 01:56:50.669]  Take the converse of that.
[01:56:51.369 --> 01:57:00.416]  They illegally violate the Constitution in 800 plus cities and 20-something states and will not arrest illegal aliens even when they're committing crimes.
[01:57:00.856 --> 01:57:03.919]  So that makes them above the law because no one will deport them.
[01:57:04.679 --> 01:57:07.021]  That's an example of nullification right there.
[01:57:07.827 --> 01:57:33.893]  Well, as long as we stop complying, stop helping them, and get our states to pass, like here in California, AB 351 to make the policy here of the state of California to not participate in indefinite detention under NDAA or any other law which purports to authorize indefinite detention of a person here in California, or against gun control measures, or you get a state to pass a law saying, hey, we're not going to implement these exchanges for Obamacare,
[01:57:34.393 --> 01:57:38.958]  Or the 21 states that have refused to comply with the federal government on marijuana laws.
[01:57:39.278 --> 01:57:40.880]  This is a very effective path.
[01:57:41.200 --> 01:57:47.146]  James Madison said when you get a bunch of states to refuse to cooperate with officers of the Union, it would create
[01:57:47.876 --> 01:57:53.020]  Basically roadblocks that he said would, the federal government would be hardly willing to encounter.
[01:57:53.140 --> 01:57:55.181]  And I think Madison was a pretty smart guy.
[01:57:55.201 --> 01:57:55.562]  Sure.
[01:57:55.582 --> 01:57:58.564]  If more and more people would follow him, we would have great effect.
[01:57:58.704 --> 01:57:59.825]  Sure, well here's the problem.
[01:57:59.865 --> 01:58:12.634]  They're using states' rights to try to get guns, to let illegals practice law, to let illegals have driver's license and vote in California, but then saying there's no states' rights if libertarians
[01:58:13.840 --> 01:58:21.274]  Want to nullify federal gun laws, or nullify federal spying, or nullify the federal currency and have your own state currency that's constitutional.
[01:58:21.875 --> 01:58:23.478]  They are there trying to block that.
[01:58:24.656 --> 01:58:26.616]  But there's an example of Governor Jerry Brown.
[01:58:27.117 --> 01:58:35.658]  Under real federalism, the federal government should not be allowing him to legalize all the illegals, because that is one of the three things where there's federal purview.
[01:58:36.179 --> 01:58:41.980]  So, they have a word for it, but it's slightly profane with children listening, but it's something backwards.
[01:58:42.540 --> 01:58:45.901]  Begins with an A, ends with an S. It's A-S-S backwards.
[01:58:46.261 --> 01:58:48.301]  This whole thing is A-S-S backwards.
[01:58:50.082 --> 01:58:51.782]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:59:00.930 --> 01:59:02.051]  We are winning.
[01:59:02.111 --> 01:59:09.334]  Alternative media is challenging and beating mainstream media, and it's imperative for the Liberty Movement to continue this momentum.
[01:59:09.834 --> 01:59:16.416]  However, independent media cannot win without the support of sponsors and advertisers like Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:59:16.857 --> 01:59:22.199]  For over 26 years, Diamond Gusset has been owned by Patriots with products designed for Patriots.
[01:59:22.699 --> 01:59:28.224]  When I put on a pair of Diamond Gusset jeans, I enjoy the quality, comfort, durability and style.
[01:59:28.725 --> 01:59:31.548]  Most importantly, my wife really likes them as well.
[01:59:32.048 --> 01:59:39.255]  From the cotton to the last stitch, Diamond Gusset bucks the industry standard by producing a 100% all-American product.
[01:59:39.555 --> 01:59:40.977]  Another reason for my endorsement.

[02:00:14.281 --> 02:00:18.442]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:19.102 --> 02:00:19.922]  You want answers?
[02:00:20.682 --> 02:00:21.582]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:22.242 --> 02:00:25.863]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:26.423 --> 02:00:30.524]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:36.005 --> 02:00:40.266]  Alright, it's the final segment with Michael Bolden on the 10th Amendment, Center.com.
[02:00:40.306 --> 02:00:40.726]  Then we've got
[02:00:41.829 --> 02:00:47.312]  McAvee is scheduled to be joining us to get into the NSA.
[02:00:48.852 --> 02:00:56.956]  But again, ladies and gentlemen, the federal government is completely run by the globalists who want to bankrupt this country, drive down the wages.
[02:00:58.217 --> 02:01:03.039]  I'm all for free market, but you can't have free trade with slave nations like China.
[02:01:04.554 --> 02:01:07.596]  You can't do that or you will become bankrupt.
[02:01:07.616 --> 02:01:08.697]  You will become impoverished.
[02:01:08.717 --> 02:01:09.738]  This is not free market.
[02:01:09.758 --> 02:01:12.100]  I don't want to get off into that digressing.
[02:01:12.120 --> 02:01:14.702]  It's a libertarian debate, but I think it's pretty much settled.
[02:01:15.883 --> 02:01:25.551]  The issue here is, and I don't think anybody ever makes this point, the Democrats are using nullification already to set up their own little empires.
[02:01:25.571 --> 02:01:26.732]  What's your take on that, Michael?
[02:01:27.509 --> 02:01:32.752]  Well, I think everybody uses constitutional tools when it advances them and they ignore it when it doesn't.
[02:01:32.832 --> 02:01:38.254]  So, these guys are going to do good things when, well, or bad things when it furthers their own interests.
[02:01:38.274 --> 02:01:43.057]  That's all we can expect from the Imperial Congress on both sides of the political spectrum.
[02:01:43.337 --> 02:01:48.158]  But we're really trying to implement basically what would be a reverse Clover Piven strategy.
[02:01:48.478 --> 02:02:01.321]  If Kansas says no we're not going to participate in federal gun control measures and California says we're not going to participate in federal unconstitutional federal drug law measures or the indefinite detention in another state does Obamacare in another state does this.
[02:02:01.641 --> 02:02:09.123]  It basically throws it all back on the federal government and they don't have the manpower to carry out all their stuff without us complying.
[02:02:09.483 --> 02:02:10.444]  They just can't do it.
[02:02:10.524 --> 02:02:22.430]  Even the National Governors Association just last week put out this scare thing about the so-called shutdown saying, hey, states help the federal government implement what they said most federal programs.
[02:02:22.711 --> 02:02:28.974]  They all know that they rely on us locally and in our states to participate in... That's right, that's right.
[02:02:29.034 --> 02:02:30.775]  Compliant people will be slaves.
[02:02:31.456 --> 02:02:34.037]  I mean, we comply and think that's a free society.
[02:02:34.417 --> 02:02:37.179]  No, the government's broken the social contract on purpose
[02:02:38.433 --> 02:02:41.315]  It's time to stop working with them whenever you can.
[02:02:41.936 --> 02:02:44.438]  And this is why Gucciardi should be a hero, really.
[02:02:44.518 --> 02:02:51.723]  Because he didn't, you know, just bow down and say, don't follow those signs as he drove into the NSA data center there in Utah last week.
[02:02:51.963 --> 02:02:53.024]  He said, I'm going to go do this.
[02:02:53.064 --> 02:02:55.246]  I'm going to try to exercise my rights to free speech.
[02:02:55.486 --> 02:02:58.028]  And he did it to the point where they were going to use violence on him.
[02:02:58.048 --> 02:03:01.751]  But this is the type of step that more and more people need to take.
[02:03:01.771 --> 02:03:05.594]  If it's just Anthony Gucciardi doing it on his own, we're not going to have freedom.
[02:03:05.814 --> 02:03:09.735]  We need to follow that type of courage and have more and more people take that type of action.
[02:03:09.775 --> 02:03:18.797]  So as regards to the NSA, the NSA data center in Utah requires 1.7 million gallons of water to operate every single day to keep those supercomputers cooled.
[02:03:19.057 --> 02:03:20.157]  Well, who's that provided by?
[02:03:20.477 --> 02:03:22.818]  A political subdivision of the state of Utah.
[02:03:23.058 --> 02:03:24.798]  Well, Utah doesn't have to give them the water.
[02:03:24.938 --> 02:03:28.399]  They can turn off the water and then there's no more NSA data center.
[02:03:29.443 --> 02:03:35.088]  And by the way, folks, we could take over Utah, politically, it's already happening, and shut the water off.
[02:03:35.689 --> 02:03:36.910]  Because that's not the U.S.
[02:03:36.930 --> 02:03:37.510]  government there.
[02:03:37.551 --> 02:03:42.275]  That is a globalist crime syndicate setting up a technocratic technocracy.
[02:03:42.875 --> 02:03:43.496]  We don't have to.
[02:03:43.516 --> 02:03:47.900]  There's nothing in the Constitution that requires us to help the Fed violate our rights.
[02:03:48.180 --> 02:03:50.983]  They're the NSA data center opening up in San Antonio.
[02:03:51.263 --> 02:03:55.207]  Well, the electricity is going to be provided by the city of San Antonio.
[02:03:55.487 --> 02:03:56.888]  Why does San Antonio have to do that?
[02:03:57.008 --> 02:03:57.909]  Turn off the switch.
[02:03:58.189 --> 02:04:00.031]  Make it as difficult as possible.
[02:04:00.191 --> 02:04:02.373]  Create as many impediments for them to violate our rights.
[02:04:02.393 --> 02:04:05.416]  And by the way, that's what they're doing to us under Cloward and Piven and Gen 21.
[02:04:05.716 --> 02:04:09.939]  They're making it difficult for us and saying they want to make us poor to control us.
[02:04:10.760 --> 02:04:12.921]  Absolutely, but their strategies are very effective.
[02:04:12.961 --> 02:04:15.801]  As we see year in and year out, they make it more and more difficult.
[02:04:15.942 --> 02:04:22.723]  So we learn from their evil strategies, flip it around on them, just like James Madison advised, and we're going to have a lot of success.
[02:04:22.743 --> 02:04:23.204]  Oh, I agree.
[02:04:23.344 --> 02:04:32.746]  Every way you can, without breaking laws or whatever, and of course, individually, do whatever you think is best, folks, sabotage the enemy by not complying, and just speak out.
[02:04:32.786 --> 02:04:35.807]  Like, whenever I see aspartame gum, I speak out at the checkout.
[02:04:35.827 --> 02:04:39.208]  Whenever I see people that are pregnant, I go over and tell them how deadly vaccines are.
[02:04:39.528 --> 02:04:44.152]  I just fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, and know you're winning every time you do it.
[02:04:44.752 --> 02:04:48.055]  All right, 10thAmendmentCenter.com, Michael Bolden, thank you so much for your time, buddy.
[02:04:48.515 --> 02:04:50.296]  Thank you so much for having me back on, Alex.
[02:04:50.336 --> 02:04:53.819]  You've done a good job helping to get AB351 signed by the governor out there.
[02:04:53.839 --> 02:04:54.920]  Thank you.
[02:04:55.140 --> 02:04:58.403]  At least, you know, they did something good out there.
[02:04:58.683 --> 02:04:59.363]  Mr. Moonbeam.
[02:04:59.664 --> 02:05:03.927]  Well, that's because they think they can just not implement it, but at least it's so they can act like they're still liberals.
[02:05:04.327 --> 02:05:07.029]  Well, we've got the policy, and now we're going to follow up with step two.
[02:05:07.049 --> 02:05:07.530]  That's right.
[02:05:10.276 --> 02:05:15.357]  Alex Jones here, and I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show, My Patriot Supply.
[02:05:15.737 --> 02:05:24.199]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.

[02:08:11.132 --> 02:08:14.935]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:29.952 --> 02:08:34.515]  Yeah, he did go to the highest level.
[02:08:34.835 --> 02:08:38.777]  And wow, look how everything he talked about has come true.
[02:08:39.017 --> 02:08:40.578]  I don't think he's a liar.
[02:08:57.728 --> 02:08:59.869]  You know, this song is really funny.
[02:09:00.009 --> 02:09:00.849]  I'm not attacking it.
[02:09:01.590 --> 02:09:02.570]  I'm just exposing it.
[02:09:03.310 --> 02:09:08.273]  They say that the Christians in this stole the God from the Jews and the Muslims.
[02:09:10.374 --> 02:09:13.015]  When Christ obviously came out of...
[02:09:14.600 --> 02:09:23.626]  Is Israelite, Jewish, Covenant, Old Testament, into the New Testament, but then is a new covenant for the Gentiles.
[02:09:24.086 --> 02:09:32.971]  So you could say, stole it from the Jews, which isn't really stealing, but to say the Muslims that came hundreds of years later, and it's also to say they follow the same God.
[02:09:33.572 --> 02:09:36.894]  Just amazing what these rock star people come up with.
[02:09:36.954 --> 02:09:39.375]  The ridiculous anti-Christian stuff.
[02:09:41.316 --> 02:09:42.137]  Even though it's a good song.
[02:09:44.753 --> 02:09:45.373]  All right, that's enough.
[02:09:46.954 --> 02:09:50.115]  We're getting McAvee on the line here, working on getting him on.
[02:09:50.495 --> 02:09:54.196]  John McAvee to give us his take on the NSA situation and dark web rising.
[02:09:54.636 --> 02:09:58.617]  McAvee founded to launch new NSA killer privacy device.
[02:09:58.637 --> 02:10:01.878]  So we'll see what's going on with him.
[02:10:02.619 --> 02:10:06.540]  He's been on the show before, but it's always a kettle of fish getting him on.
[02:10:08.618 --> 02:10:16.600]  Before I go any further, here are some of the news articles up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:10:16.720 --> 02:10:18.120]  SEAL Team 6 raids.
[02:10:18.620 --> 02:10:23.761]  More war on terror theatrics getting into all the fake propaganda SEAL Team 6 is ordered to be part of.
[02:10:24.741 --> 02:10:28.822]  And the argument is, well, you're in PSYOPS now, so we do lie to the public.
[02:10:29.782 --> 02:10:34.303]  Justice Department caught in Amber Alert takedown hoax.
[02:10:34.683 --> 02:10:35.704]  That is really big, folks.
[02:10:35.744 --> 02:10:37.624]  The Amber Alert is still up, still operating.
[02:10:39.209 --> 02:10:43.210]  For missing children, that they've now expanded to anti-gun stuff and things, as I told you they would.
[02:10:43.230 --> 02:10:45.451]  It was always set up for that 15 years ago.
[02:10:45.531 --> 02:10:48.933]  But the larger issue is, is that it's still operating.
[02:10:49.193 --> 02:10:51.633]  The Justice Department just blocked access to the website.
[02:10:52.054 --> 02:10:53.414]  The site's still up, everything.
[02:10:53.474 --> 02:10:54.475]  A total fraud.
[02:10:54.935 --> 02:10:57.396]  Very important article to show the scams they're involved in.
[02:10:58.216 --> 02:11:00.097]  Up on InfoWars.com.
[02:11:01.437 --> 02:11:04.138]  They shut it down, just like all the park service sites and others.
[02:11:04.438 --> 02:11:05.418]  The sites are still there.
[02:11:05.698 --> 02:11:09.259]  They just block access to the kids' games and everything else.
[02:11:09.299 --> 02:11:12.660]  But the shopping carts, they're still open for the feds to make money.
[02:11:12.680 --> 02:11:13.680]  Everything else is closed.
[02:11:14.660 --> 02:11:16.461]  Photos of the Grand Canyon, you name it.
[02:11:17.341 --> 02:11:21.542]  Also, leader of former Syrian Communist Party and member of CIA,
[02:11:23.082 --> 02:11:26.224]  Controlled by SNC arrested.
[02:11:26.684 --> 02:11:32.568]  And that's a story getting into all these terrorist leaders and reported terrorist leaders really working with the CIA.
[02:11:33.308 --> 02:11:35.570]  Also a very important article by Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:11:35.950 --> 02:11:44.675]  Americans more interested according to Google searches in Miley Cyrus football than Obamacare or government shutdown.
[02:11:45.676 --> 02:11:49.438]  And see, I'd say about half the public doesn't even know what planet they're on.
[02:11:50.965 --> 02:11:57.349]  And those are the people that are voting to take our guns, open the borders up, drive down their wages, get double-charged for Obamacare.
[02:11:57.850 --> 02:11:59.971]  These are the people that Obama's laughing at.
[02:12:01.212 --> 02:12:04.994]  And then you've got all the right-wingers who are awake now because they don't like Democrats.
[02:12:05.355 --> 02:12:08.157]  As soon as a Republican gets in, most of them are going to go back to sleep.
[02:12:08.757 --> 02:12:11.419]  And it's time that people not be this gullible and this stupid.
[02:12:11.659 --> 02:12:14.481]  Though I've got to say, folks, the average Democrat
[02:12:15.717 --> 02:12:22.985]  I always wonder why Democrats celebrate how smart they are and talk about how high their IQs are and talk about how everybody else is dumb.
[02:12:23.045 --> 02:12:25.087]  It's like a celebration of how smart they are.
[02:12:25.127 --> 02:12:31.433]  It's because they know they're dumbed down, cattle-like, domesticated followers.
[02:12:32.815 --> 02:12:33.516]  They know.
[02:12:35.891 --> 02:12:40.712]  That they have the most pathetic, domesticated, dumbed-down people following them.
[02:12:40.772 --> 02:12:57.557]  So yes, it's true that the intelligentsia of the Democratic Party may have two or three or four degrees and basically usually work for government or for higher education, and then they run around saying everyone else is dumb who doesn't accept what they believe.
[02:12:57.917 --> 02:12:59.517]  But it really is a religion!
[02:12:59.537 --> 02:13:01.818]  I mean, I was on the New Republic
[02:13:02.691 --> 02:13:13.539]  site that's calling for Obama to have a coup d'etat over Congress and blow up the Congress building like Yeltsin did the Duma or the Russian Parliament back in 1991.
[02:13:13.739 --> 02:13:16.581]  They even show photos of the burning building.
[02:13:17.401 --> 02:13:19.203]  And it doesn't say satire on the article.
[02:13:19.223 --> 02:13:20.684]  They say that's how Russians handled it.
[02:13:22.844 --> 02:13:27.286]  And of course that was a group that hadn't been elected, they'd been voted out, so then they were illegitimate.
[02:13:27.806 --> 02:13:28.786]  This is the opposite.
[02:13:29.267 --> 02:13:35.889]  This is Congress and more diversified, 500 plus people, and they're bucking what Obama's doing and doing a better job.
[02:13:35.909 --> 02:13:38.730]  They're still terrible, but overall they're the lesser of two evils.
[02:13:39.370 --> 02:13:40.091]  And he's saying
[02:13:41.209 --> 02:13:45.472]  Well, this writer is saying, this woman is saying, it's time to, you know, take the gloves off.
[02:13:45.512 --> 02:13:49.334]  Well, they want him to be like Lincoln and arrest 30-something members of Congress.
[02:13:49.674 --> 02:13:52.096]  They want them to shut down members of the news.
[02:13:52.436 --> 02:13:55.718]  They want them to arrest members of the press.
[02:13:55.738 --> 02:14:00.021]  I'm going to go to your phone calls while we're waiting to line up McAvee.
[02:14:01.242 --> 02:14:02.503]  But here's what I'm talking about.
[02:14:03.623 --> 02:14:07.186]  When I say they want him to do that, he is doing that.
[02:14:07.846 --> 02:14:08.867]  They're persecuting.
[02:14:10.339 --> 02:14:16.880]  The pastors and priests saying you'll be arrested if you volunteer off hours and minister to troops.
[02:14:19.061 --> 02:14:22.161]  The archdiocese that handles that has gone public with the memo.
[02:14:24.322 --> 02:14:27.983]  Do you understand that that is that is Soviet Union right there?
[02:14:28.763 --> 02:14:29.743]  That is Soviet Union.
[02:14:30.583 --> 02:14:32.583]  That is Soviet Union.
[02:14:34.124 --> 02:14:39.805]  These men are employed by the government to ensure that a priest is available when an active duty Catholic chaplain is not present.
[02:14:40.748 --> 02:14:45.933]  to Catholics or military bases worldwide are not permitted to work, not even to volunteer.
[02:14:45.973 --> 02:14:52.559]  During the shutdown, it is illegal for them to minister on base, and they risk being arrested if they attempt to do so.
[02:14:52.859 --> 02:14:54.580]  And this is what the federal government has told them.
[02:14:54.921 --> 02:15:07.092]  This is the magnitude of them persecuting thousands of churches, hundreds of pro-life groups, AP reporters, and then here it is in the news today,
[02:15:08.559 --> 02:15:10.560]  Why reporters fear Team Obama.
[02:15:11.441 --> 02:15:12.181]  New York Post.
[02:15:13.102 --> 02:15:13.682]  Here's another one.
[02:15:14.123 --> 02:15:15.103]  New York Times reporter.
[02:15:15.183 --> 02:15:18.886]  Obama administration most closed, controlled, freak administration we've ever covered.
[02:15:20.067 --> 02:15:22.989]  ATF tries to block whistleblower agents fast and furious book.
[02:15:23.429 --> 02:15:26.971]  They're threatening to not let it be published and threatening to arrest people.
[02:15:27.772 --> 02:15:29.973]  This is the type of stuff we're talking about here.
[02:15:32.275 --> 02:15:32.555]  Okay?
[02:15:34.316 --> 02:15:35.357]  Obama advisor.
[02:15:38.134 --> 02:15:40.599]  Demand overwhelmed Obamacare, they're lying and saying.
[02:15:40.619 --> 02:15:42.742]  I mean, this is the type of tyranny.
[02:15:43.784 --> 02:15:45.868]  But then here's the other one I wanted to get into.
[02:15:46.670 --> 02:15:47.471]  Looking at
[02:15:48.604 --> 02:15:52.166]  The New Republic saying basically attack Congress.
[02:15:52.446 --> 02:15:54.126]  They're already attacking Congress.
[02:15:54.146 --> 02:15:56.667]  They're already using NSA to blackmail people.
[02:15:56.868 --> 02:16:05.751]  They're already persecuting the press and persecuting the clergy and getting right in the middle of the First Amendment and telling Christian charities you're going to pay for abortions.
[02:16:06.332 --> 02:16:09.373]  I mean this is outrageous what we're already putting up with.
[02:16:09.693 --> 02:16:11.614]  He's already doing what Lincoln did.
[02:16:13.018 --> 02:16:14.819]  But Lincoln didn't go after the clergy.
[02:16:15.159 --> 02:16:16.901]  Lincoln didn't say what they could pray.
[02:16:16.921 --> 02:16:22.384]  I mean, this is, in many ways, worse than the tyranny that Lincoln was involved in.
[02:16:22.404 --> 02:16:25.807]  And I'm not debating whether Lincoln was good or bad.
[02:16:25.967 --> 02:16:27.608]  The British stirred the South up.
[02:16:28.008 --> 02:16:30.350]  The North was doing some bad trade tactics to them.
[02:16:30.630 --> 02:16:31.470]  Both sides were wrong.
[02:16:31.491 --> 02:16:32.711]  It was a plan to break the country up.
[02:16:33.252 --> 02:16:34.913]  That's full-spectrum analysis, folks.
[02:16:34.993 --> 02:16:35.773]  Both sides were wrong.
[02:16:36.734 --> 02:16:39.356]  It was Jackson that actually stopped a war the first time.
[02:16:41.741 --> 02:16:46.205]  A few decades before, when he was president, between the North and the South, fighting with each other.
[02:16:46.765 --> 02:16:53.411]  The point is, is that, it just hit me today, man, this is worse than I even thought, and he's getting away with it.
[02:16:53.611 --> 02:17:04.580]  Which means, even if Obama leaves office later, which he'll probably will, doesn't stage some terror attack, the precedent's set to go after whistleblowers and free speech in this country, and we do now have him on the line.
[02:17:04.620 --> 02:17:06.542]  After he leaves us, we'll go to your phone calls.
[02:17:06.882 --> 02:17:09.664]  John McAfee, of course, doesn't need any
[02:17:10.754 --> 02:17:16.537]  Introduction, the inventor of the multi-billion dollar antivirus software McAvee.
[02:17:18.478 --> 02:17:20.459]  The new article's out on Infowars.com.
[02:17:20.519 --> 02:17:26.302]  Dark web rising, McAvee founder to launch new NSA privacy device.
[02:17:26.362 --> 02:17:27.522]  And I want to get into that with him.
[02:17:27.542 --> 02:17:29.904]  We've got to go to break in a minute because we're late getting him on.
[02:17:30.284 --> 02:17:32.005]  First, I want to ask how he's been doing.
[02:17:33.638 --> 02:17:42.202]  Since he tried to be set up down there in famously piratical beliefs, and then what else has happened since we haven't talked to him in about four or five months.
[02:17:43.143 --> 02:17:44.984]  John, thank you so much for coming on with us, sir.
[02:17:45.704 --> 02:17:46.824]  Well, thank you for having me, Alex.
[02:17:46.924 --> 02:17:48.325]  I really enjoyed being on your program.
[02:17:49.266 --> 02:17:51.947]  Again, whoismackofv.com, is that the best website?
[02:17:54.107 --> 02:17:55.369]  Okay, we're going to break here in a few minutes.
[02:17:55.389 --> 02:18:00.576]  Just update us on how you've been doing since you got out of that terror operation down there.
[02:18:00.896 --> 02:18:07.746]  I would add months after you were on, riots and plots did come out in the news out of Belize, really boosting your credibility.
[02:18:08.806 --> 02:18:10.908]  Well, yes, actually a lot of things have come out.
[02:18:10.948 --> 02:18:17.853]  They just got rid of their Minister of Internal Security because he was selling passports to the Koreans and got caught by Interpol.
[02:18:17.873 --> 02:18:20.095]  So anyway, I've been doing fine.
[02:18:20.135 --> 02:18:21.916]  I've been working on my new project.
[02:18:22.777 --> 02:18:28.281]  I am very alarmed with what's happening in privacy in America and the invasive tactics of the NSA.
[02:18:29.241 --> 02:18:31.943]  I have been working on this device for a number of years.
[02:18:32.064 --> 02:18:36.327]  I've accelerated it in the past few months and will have a prototype working in six months.
[02:18:36.847 --> 02:18:37.648]  Very exciting!
[02:18:37.688 --> 02:18:40.130]  Can you give us any tidbits on how it works?
[02:18:54.993 --> 02:19:03.101]  And an application that runs on your iPhone or your Android or whatever device you're using, including laptops and iPads.
[02:19:04.262 --> 02:19:07.165]  And it basically turns your telephone into two devices.
[02:19:07.405 --> 02:19:10.809]  One, which connects to the internet normally for whatever.
[02:19:10.829 --> 02:19:18.036]  And the other, which creates a completely secure local web, which is relayed across the world.
[02:19:18.636 --> 02:19:28.138]  The local web, nothing can identify you as where you are, what your name is, nothing, no ID even to the hardware device.
[02:19:28.158 --> 02:19:29.598]  So it's a proxy device?
[02:19:30.158 --> 02:19:33.519]  It's a proxy device, but it's a completely secure proxy device.
[02:19:34.059 --> 02:19:38.980]  The encryption is something that I personally have developed, the NSA, nor any other agency is involved.
[02:19:39.340 --> 02:19:40.600]  And that's the problem now.
[02:19:40.960 --> 02:19:44.421]  The NSA helped, to use the word in quotes,
[02:19:45.321 --> 02:19:57.431]  Well yeah, in fact I've read about them pressuring people saying it's a disruptive technology if they don't let them put a back door in it.
[02:19:57.731 --> 02:19:58.972]  You're of course an expert on this.
[02:19:59.012 --> 02:20:03.996]  I couldn't think of a better guest to break down what's happening with the NSA than Mr. McAfee.
[02:20:04.436 --> 02:20:06.398]  Who is McAfee.com is the website.
[02:20:06.918 --> 02:20:08.539]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com.

[02:21:09.733 --> 02:21:11.093]  You are now in the crosshairs.
[02:21:11.373 --> 02:21:15.494]  The NSA and the FBI are treating you like a criminal and monitoring your every move.
[02:21:15.814 --> 02:21:22.556]  Ron Paul said recently, the evidence of the totalitarian nature of this government is on display undeniably every day.
[02:21:23.036 --> 02:21:26.877]  What's taking place right now is a coup and the destruction of the Constitution.
[02:21:27.297 --> 02:21:29.097]  Fortunately, there is something you can do about it.
[02:21:29.417 --> 02:21:33.538]  Learn how to be invisible, lock down your privacy, and even disappear forever.

[02:21:38.837 --> 02:21:39.857]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:21:39.937 --> 02:21:44.258]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:21:44.398 --> 02:21:50.039]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:21:50.139 --> 02:21:52.240]  Gold has outperformed paper investments yet.
[02:21:52.300 --> 02:21:53.480]  No word about IRAs.
[02:21:53.720 --> 02:21:58.381]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[02:22:08.243 --> 02:22:09.604]  Isn't Wi-Fi great?

[02:22:12.767 --> 02:22:15.049]  Coffee shops, airports, libraries.
[02:22:15.630 --> 02:22:19.553]  But using public Wi-Fi means that people can spy on you.
[02:22:19.873 --> 02:22:24.738]  And it's easy as... Yep, they can access your data at the touch of a button.
[02:22:25.318 --> 02:22:30.503]  Seriously, even your internet service provider can see every website you ever go to.
[02:22:31.243 --> 02:22:33.866]  Private internet access has got your back.
[02:22:34.426 --> 02:22:34.686]  How?
[02:22:35.327 --> 02:22:42.814]  Well, it's kinda nerdy, but to put it simply, spies and companies that track you don't like us one bit.
[02:22:43.534 --> 02:22:47.198]  We create an encrypted tunnel so that nobody can spy on you.

[02:24:18.800 --> 02:24:26.436]  Well, one of the pioneers of internet security worked for NASA, Xerox, and started McAfee.
[02:24:28.686 --> 02:24:30.388]  Who is McAvee.com?
[02:24:30.988 --> 02:24:39.396]  John agreed to come on our show first, and Joe Rogan second, because he was told by people he trusted that he could trust us.
[02:24:40.017 --> 02:24:49.706]  And I gotta be honest with you, I mean, I believe most of what he was saying, but it was so wild about the passports and about the certain Arab groups, he even named what groups by name
[02:24:50.347 --> 02:24:51.747]  And then it all came out in the press.
[02:24:51.767 --> 02:24:52.988]  He was being accurate later.
[02:24:53.488 --> 02:24:55.828]  And all I can say is he's really blessed to be alive.
[02:24:56.308 --> 02:24:57.569]  John, this is a short segment.
[02:24:57.589 --> 02:24:58.949]  I know you want to get into Obamacare.
[02:24:59.349 --> 02:25:02.230]  From what I've seen, it's the legalization of the NSA.
[02:25:02.750 --> 02:25:04.050]  It data mines everything.
[02:25:04.070 --> 02:25:05.431]  I know you've been writing about that.
[02:25:05.851 --> 02:25:07.371]  As an expert, tell us about that.
[02:25:07.431 --> 02:25:10.172]  And I can't wait till this device comes out as well.
[02:25:12.325 --> 02:25:21.292]  The problem with Obamacare, and this is just from a technological standpoint, Alex, is that there is absolutely no security at all.
[02:25:21.312 --> 02:25:35.825]  For example, I can create a website, claim to be an agent, and let you log on, and because it's a healthcare system, I can ask you the most intimate questions and you're going to answer them online.
[02:25:35.845 --> 02:25:39.308]  I will then get your social security number, your birth date.
[02:25:39.788 --> 02:25:44.170]  All the information I need to assume your identity and empty your bank account the following day.
[02:25:44.811 --> 02:25:50.974]  And yet, there's nothing in this central system that I can go to to verify that this is a legitimate website.
[02:25:51.294 --> 02:25:52.114]  It's insane.
[02:25:52.254 --> 02:25:53.595]  It is insane beyond belief.
[02:25:53.895 --> 02:25:56.896]  And I don't know who thought this thing up, but they have to be a complete idiot.
[02:25:57.637 --> 02:26:03.760]  Or they want to bring down the whole ID system and force everyone onto biometrics via brainwaves, which is what Toyota and others are going to.
[02:26:04.653 --> 02:26:09.935]  Well, you know, I don't have a clue about that, but I know that it is the most insecure thing for Americans.
[02:26:09.975 --> 02:26:14.217]  Now, if you're signing up for Obamacare, you have no idea if it's a legitimate website.
[02:26:14.637 --> 02:26:25.681]  And I can tell you now, the cost to the consumers, to the American public, in terms of identity theft and their bank accounts being wiped out is going to be many times the entire cost of the Obamacare program.
[02:26:26.042 --> 02:26:26.782]  This is insane.
[02:26:27.941 --> 02:26:33.824]  Sure, my point is they're coming out with cars that start via your brainwave fingerprint.
[02:26:34.204 --> 02:26:39.426]  Well now they're just going to steal the signature of your brainwave or cut your finger off to get into these iPhone 5s.
[02:26:39.806 --> 02:26:45.169]  You as a top security expert for decades, what is the best form of internet security?
[02:26:46.348 --> 02:26:48.850]  You know, common sense is number one, okay?
[02:26:48.970 --> 02:26:50.631]  For example, let's use Obamacare.
[02:26:50.651 --> 02:26:57.135]  If you're going to be signing up at all, make sure that it's a legitimate site.
[02:26:57.635 --> 02:27:05.220]  Number two, never ever give out information that's private to you, even if your own bank calls you and you're sure that it's the same bank.
[02:27:05.240 --> 02:27:07.622]  Because, wait a minute, that should be on file with you already.
[02:27:07.682 --> 02:27:08.282]  Why are you calling
[02:27:08.362 --> 02:27:15.068]  Look at how Academy Sporting Goods always asks for your number, your zip code.
[02:27:15.328 --> 02:27:20.232]  Somebody could be listening right there, steal your credit cards, and then use your credit cards with that zip code.
[02:27:20.873 --> 02:27:21.413]  Absolutely.
[02:27:21.674 --> 02:27:26.438]  So you just never speak it, you never write it, you never give it to anybody, and if someone's asking you for it,
[02:27:26.958 --> 02:27:28.119]  What the hell are they asking it for?
[02:27:28.199 --> 02:27:28.839]  Excuse my language.
[02:27:29.120 --> 02:27:30.020]  Why are they asking you?
[02:27:30.340 --> 02:27:31.201]  This is the problem.
[02:27:31.581 --> 02:27:35.844]  You know, we are so gullible, some of us, that we go, well, okay, it's the government, it must be safe.
[02:27:36.344 --> 02:27:38.666]  Or, you know, it's my bank calling me, it must be okay.
[02:27:38.686 --> 02:27:40.327]  Well, it's very seldom safe.
[02:27:40.727 --> 02:27:42.849]  Never give out anything about yourself.
[02:27:42.909 --> 02:27:43.809]  Not your home address.
[02:27:44.150 --> 02:27:45.150]  Not the name of your wife.
[02:27:45.490 --> 02:27:46.611]  Not the name of your parents.
[02:27:46.891 --> 02:27:47.752]  Not where you're going.
[02:27:48.272 --> 02:27:48.653]  Nothing.
[02:27:49.213 --> 02:27:51.254]  And if people ask for it, be suspicious.
[02:27:51.594 --> 02:27:52.415]  Be really suspicious.
[02:27:53.234 --> 02:28:04.552]  Well you know how much, obviously you know, but for listeners, thieves all over the world now sit with scanners picking up all the cordless phone traffic where you're on the bank giving them all your info.
[02:28:04.812 --> 02:28:06.575]  That's how they're stealing all the identities.
[02:28:07.575 --> 02:28:08.035]  Absolutely.
[02:28:08.075 --> 02:28:08.876]  It's one of the ways.
[02:28:08.916 --> 02:28:10.796]  They're stealing it in every sort of way.
[02:28:11.096 --> 02:28:14.437]  But now, the government is actually one of the hackers, in my mind.
[02:28:14.457 --> 02:28:17.739]  I mean, they're wanting inside your head.
[02:28:17.779 --> 02:28:19.099]  They're wanting to know your intentions.
[02:28:19.119 --> 02:28:22.980]  They want to know who you live, who your friends are, why you're friends with them.
[02:28:23.961 --> 02:28:25.281]  Something is seriously wrong here.
[02:28:25.321 --> 02:28:29.703]  Privacy, in my mind, is one of our unique and inalienable rights.
[02:28:29.963 --> 02:28:33.224]  The right to privacy we have lost as American citizens.
[02:28:35.410 --> 02:28:39.954]  We were all brought up to the Soviet Union, 1984, fiction, this nightmare.
[02:28:40.215 --> 02:28:42.277]  We're beyond 1984, aren't we, John?
[02:28:43.456 --> 02:28:44.357]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:29:08.669 --> 02:29:15.299]  But then if I try to go to the NSA or my reporters do, just to ask questions at the front gate, they flip out and act like we're terrorists.
[02:29:16.180 --> 02:29:17.722]  Well, also, you're probably going to get audited.
[02:29:17.942 --> 02:29:23.430]  Well, I mean, it just shows they want all their privacy from us, but we have no privacy.
[02:29:24.173 --> 02:29:24.674]  Absolutely.
[02:29:24.994 --> 02:29:27.938]  That's the government, what it's doing, and you become an enemy.
[02:29:28.419 --> 02:29:32.624]  Yet you try to keep the government from knowing what you do, then you become the enemy as well.
[02:29:32.644 --> 02:29:33.786]  It's like insane.
[02:29:34.026 --> 02:29:40.195]  There's no hope in this system until we regain some inalienable rights within our constitution.
[02:29:41.055 --> 02:29:43.496]  The founding father of internet security.
[02:29:44.117 --> 02:29:46.238]  The founding father of internet security, John McAfee.
[02:29:46.498 --> 02:29:47.258]  You can really say that.
[02:29:47.298 --> 02:29:49.039]  He's one of the founding fathers of internet security.
[02:29:49.600 --> 02:29:51.221]  And an incredible character to boot.
[02:29:51.261 --> 02:29:52.481]  Sir, final segment with you.
[02:29:52.922 --> 02:29:58.825]  I want to talk about whatever you're into, what you think is most important, when we come back in just three minutes with John.
[02:29:58.845 --> 02:29:59.665]  We're on the march.
[02:30:00.166 --> 02:30:01.767]  The empire's on the run.
[02:30:02.707 --> 02:30:05.369]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:09.929 --> 02:30:12.691]  Protecting your home with a security system is a must.
[02:30:12.911 --> 02:30:18.955]  But when it comes to protecting your family, your home, and belongings, there's no need to sign a long-term contract.
[02:30:19.295 --> 02:30:25.679]  Listen, there is some real scum in the alarm business cashing in by locking you into long, punishing contracts.
[02:30:26.079 --> 02:30:28.040]  Not with SimpliSafe Home Security.
[02:30:28.381 --> 02:30:29.421]  They're the good guys.

[02:30:32.804 --> 02:30:37.086]  SimpliSafe was created by a Harvard Business School engineer, and it's revolutionary.

[02:33:13.812 --> 02:33:20.094]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:20.994 --> 02:33:23.255]  You're not in the Twilight Zone!
[02:33:43.066 --> 02:33:46.908]  You're in the New World Order, where the inmates run the asylum.
[02:33:47.648 --> 02:33:49.649]  John McAfee is our guest.
[02:33:49.709 --> 02:33:51.931]  Whoismcafee.com.
[02:33:52.931 --> 02:33:54.712]  All right, there's so much going on in the world.
[02:33:54.752 --> 02:33:55.993]  Let's get into the NSA.
[02:33:56.013 --> 02:34:12.081]  Let's get into the power grab, the panoptagon, the technocracy they're trying to build, sir, and how you think culturally we can change this and stop this and what you think is also most positive about what's happening right now after you cover what's most negative.
[02:34:14.809 --> 02:34:19.731]  I think the first thing I'd like to say is what's needed, Alex, is we need to stop being afraid.
[02:34:21.212 --> 02:34:43.326]  For example, it's clear that this allowed us to let the government, at the end of 9-11, create the Homeland Security, all of the things that... Getting on an airplane now, you know, I travel a lot, so it's like I get halfway undressed five times a week just to travel somewhere so that they can make sure I'm not a threat to America.
[02:34:44.486 --> 02:34:45.847]  We're afraid, many of us.
[02:34:46.607 --> 02:34:47.947]  They're using that against us.
[02:34:47.967 --> 02:35:01.611]  My product, for example, Sony Enterprises has called my intended product a dangerous product because it will allow the crooks and hackers of the world to not be seen.
[02:35:01.631 --> 02:35:05.913]  People also use telephones, criminals use telephones.
[02:35:07.493 --> 02:35:13.337]  But the hackers already know all this stuff, so this is for the general public to protect themselves.
[02:35:13.617 --> 02:35:17.420]  It's the same argument against guns, saying you can't have a gun, you might hurt somebody.
[02:35:17.460 --> 02:35:19.501]  No, I need a gun to protect myself.
[02:35:25.185 --> 02:35:29.567]  Anything that we build which is positive is going to be used by the criminal elements of society.
[02:35:29.827 --> 02:35:30.628]  We can't stop it.
[02:35:30.948 --> 02:35:32.069]  They use telephones.
[02:35:32.089 --> 02:35:34.890]  They use cars to get away from bank robberies.
[02:35:34.930 --> 02:35:35.350]  What do we do?
[02:35:35.390 --> 02:35:36.691]  We take cars away from people?
[02:35:37.111 --> 02:35:38.052]  So this is insane.
[02:35:38.092 --> 02:35:44.155]  To use this rationale for, don't let McAfee build that product because it's dangerous.
[02:35:44.555 --> 02:35:46.236]  It's going to let crooks get away with things.
[02:35:46.676 --> 02:35:50.457]  Well, it's all going to let me be private, and you be private, and all of us be private.
[02:35:50.698 --> 02:35:51.338]  So what do we do?
[02:35:51.378 --> 02:35:54.839]  Do we sacrifice our privacy for the illusion of safety?
[02:35:55.199 --> 02:35:57.260]  There can't be safety without privacy, Alex.
[02:35:58.680 --> 02:36:02.962]  John, are we going to be able to turn this around?
[02:36:04.056 --> 02:36:06.740]  You know, I'm not sure it's going to depend on all of us, isn't it?
[02:36:07.281 --> 02:36:08.583]  I mean, this is still America.
[02:36:08.983 --> 02:36:10.205]  We still have the right to vote.
[02:36:10.766 --> 02:36:13.070]  And we still have the right to think for ourselves.
[02:36:13.490 --> 02:36:16.475]  If we stand up and go, I'm not going to be afraid anymore.
[02:36:17.319 --> 02:36:19.581]  And go to that booth and vote these people out.
[02:36:20.823 --> 02:36:22.905]  A hundred percent across the board.
[02:36:23.345 --> 02:36:28.590]  And bring in people who say, yes, we've become crazy as a society.
[02:36:28.870 --> 02:36:30.652]  We have got to return to sanity.
[02:36:31.012 --> 02:36:32.794]  It's up to us, Alex, we have to do something.
[02:36:33.074 --> 02:36:35.517]  We can't sit back and let somebody else do it for us.
[02:36:35.977 --> 02:36:36.978]  Are we willing to do that?
[02:36:37.038 --> 02:36:37.659]  That is the question.
[02:36:37.979 --> 02:36:42.901]  Well, as you know, most great empires and cultures end up committing suicide by madness.
[02:36:42.941 --> 02:36:46.483]  Those who the gods would destroy, they first make mad.
[02:36:46.503 --> 02:36:57.288]  And we really are collectively, I've talked to a lot of executives, a lot of people, and they say general craziness and self-destructiveness is increasing.
[02:36:57.348 --> 02:36:58.108]  Are you seeing that?
[02:36:59.308 --> 02:37:00.009]  Of course it is.
[02:37:00.269 --> 02:37:01.750]  I mean, absolutely, across the board.
[02:37:02.370 --> 02:37:04.751]  We're becoming a very insane society here.
[02:37:05.558 --> 02:37:07.479]  A self-destructive society, it's obvious.
[02:37:07.779 --> 02:37:09.380]  Open our eyes to look around you.
[02:37:10.200 --> 02:37:12.161]  You see it, I see it, everybody has to see it.
[02:37:12.661 --> 02:37:17.283]  We're closing our eyes to it sometimes because it requires courage to see the truth.
[02:37:18.184 --> 02:37:19.084]  Do we have the courage?
[02:37:19.619 --> 02:37:23.203]  Let me ask you this question, because this is what I dread at 3 a.m.
[02:37:23.223 --> 02:37:23.684]  in the morning.
[02:37:24.244 --> 02:37:34.275]  It's not the smart evil tyrants we face, because they've got to be dealt with, but the general morass and laziness and dumb downness, not of the whole public, but of a sizable 30-40% of people.
[02:37:36.952 --> 02:37:43.977]  Who don't even know what party Obama's in, in Malum Street interviews we've done and others have done, but support it.
[02:37:44.738 --> 02:37:50.022]  Or who don't even know their state capital, who don't even know one branch of government, much less three.
[02:37:50.642 --> 02:37:56.046]  But they have this arrogance to them where they don't care and they politically want to take our guns.
[02:37:56.367 --> 02:37:57.928]  They want the state to raise our kids.
[02:37:57.968 --> 02:38:00.330]  They are flaming authoritarians
[02:38:01.030 --> 02:38:05.272]  Posing as so-called liberals when Thomas Jefferson would literally spit on them.
[02:38:05.632 --> 02:38:08.453]  And then you've got the fake conservatives that are a bunch of tyrants as well.
[02:38:08.493 --> 02:38:10.955]  But I gotta say, I've never been a partisan guy.
[02:38:10.995 --> 02:38:13.336]  The Democrats, though, are really making their move right now.
[02:38:14.596 --> 02:38:21.799]  What do we do as producers when all these stupid parasites that literally can't tie their shoelaces want to run our lives?
[02:38:21.899 --> 02:38:22.780]  What do we do about that?
[02:38:23.567 --> 02:38:29.697]  Well, you know, first of all, the reason that many people are indifferent is because it's easy to be indifferent.
[02:38:30.218 --> 02:38:38.470]  It's easy not to know what's going on, not to know what party the president is in, because if you don't know, it can't scare you.
[02:38:39.304 --> 02:38:45.234]  If you don't know, then you can imagine anything that you want and pretend that that's true.
[02:38:45.855 --> 02:38:49.261]  That's what's happening here and that's what this world has become.
[02:38:49.601 --> 02:38:53.608]  We don't want to know many times because if we know, we have to do something.
[02:38:54.201 --> 02:38:56.743]  We don't want to do anything because doing something is scary.
[02:38:56.763 --> 02:38:58.725]  I think that's the fundamental problem.
[02:38:59.446 --> 02:39:05.170]  We have to bring a mirror in and people look at themselves and look at the truth of what's really happening here.
[02:39:05.591 --> 02:39:06.892]  I had dinner with my dad!
[02:39:06.932 --> 02:39:08.133]  I'm not a sociologist.
[02:39:08.433 --> 02:39:15.079]  I can build a product, which is what I'm doing, that you can drop in your pocket that's going into privacy, but I can't change the way people think of things.
[02:39:16.178 --> 02:39:16.558]  Sure, no.
[02:39:16.678 --> 02:39:19.820]  I mean, I had dinner with my dad last night and I said, why are they so dumb?
[02:39:19.880 --> 02:39:20.641]  Why don't they care?
[02:39:20.661 --> 02:39:22.602]  And he said, no, they don't want to know.
[02:39:22.922 --> 02:39:23.763]  They're scared.
[02:39:24.083 --> 02:39:25.123]  They're delusional.
[02:39:25.544 --> 02:39:27.505]  And they want to just be left alone.
[02:39:27.525 --> 02:39:30.687]  And I guess what you said is absolutely true.
[02:39:30.727 --> 02:39:31.167]  That's it.
[02:39:31.427 --> 02:39:37.291]  They think they're protected by not caring, but they're not caring is what's allowing the evil to take over.
[02:39:38.206 --> 02:39:40.066]  Absolutely, and that's the problem here.
[02:39:41.107 --> 02:39:57.811]  I will do anything to help people have the right to protect themselves, to have a gun, to their own privacy, but the world is full of some frighteningly indifferent people now.
[02:39:58.551 --> 02:40:00.852]  And quite frankly, I just don't know, Alex.
[02:40:00.912 --> 02:40:01.592]  I just don't know.
[02:40:02.987 --> 02:40:07.670]  Yeah, well, I'm here to tell you, to all these indifferent people that think they're going to run my life, it's over.
[02:40:08.090 --> 02:40:11.913]  We, the working, thinking people, are done with you and all your bureaucrats.
[02:40:12.253 --> 02:40:14.515]  What do you make of the persecution of reporters?
[02:40:14.875 --> 02:40:23.521]  And they've told priests, if they minister to people on the military base during the shutdown, even if somebody's had a family member die, they will be arrested.
[02:40:23.941 --> 02:40:31.886]  I mean, just to see what a tyrant Obama's turned into, he's a thousand times beyond Nixon and getting away with all of it.
[02:40:31.946 --> 02:40:32.247]  What's next?
[02:40:33.547 --> 02:40:37.670]  You know, I don't know, because what we have is, to me, the ultimate nightmare.
[02:40:37.730 --> 02:40:41.152]  I never dreamed in a thousand years that it would come to this.
[02:40:41.393 --> 02:40:42.133]  So what's next?
[02:40:42.413 --> 02:40:43.834]  My mind can't conceive it, sir.
[02:40:43.894 --> 02:40:46.316]  Wow.
[02:40:46.756 --> 02:40:47.036]  Wow.
[02:40:47.196 --> 02:40:48.537]  I don't even know what to say anymore.
[02:40:48.557 --> 02:40:54.501]  You know, after you leave us in five minutes, I know you'll think of something important you wish you would have said, so always ask this question.
[02:40:55.002 --> 02:40:58.184]  What else is on your mind, John, instead of me asking my feeble questions?
[02:40:59.428 --> 02:41:06.612]  Well, you know, what's on my mind now is how I can position my new product so that they'll actually let me build it here in America.
[02:41:06.632 --> 02:41:18.639]  You know, as it looks right now, I can assure you the music industry, the movie industry are going to be radically against it because it means that stealing their stuff is going to be easier.
[02:41:19.339 --> 02:41:20.600]  But, you know, get a clue.
[02:41:21.140 --> 02:41:24.802]  If you're building something, look at the way the world is moving and protect yourself.
[02:41:25.763 --> 02:41:28.304]  Don't make me stop producing something that gives us
[02:41:28.624 --> 02:41:30.245]  You can't have prior constraint.
[02:41:31.625 --> 02:41:36.967]  Yeah, you can't have prior constraint of everybody, like we can't have privacy because we might do something wrong.
[02:41:36.987 --> 02:41:40.908]  That's like saying your house has got to be glass because you might do something with your privacy.
[02:41:41.168 --> 02:41:42.669]  This is the essence of authoritarianism.
[02:41:42.909 --> 02:41:45.290]  That was my question I actually wanted to ask you and I'd forgotten to ask.
[02:41:45.710 --> 02:41:54.433]  They're going to try to stop you and call it disruptive technology, but there's no way, I mean, that they can stop you because people really want this unless they kill you.
[02:41:55.418 --> 02:41:57.158]  Well, that's another issue, sir.
[02:41:57.358 --> 02:41:58.999]  You know, people call me paranoid.
[02:41:59.879 --> 02:42:05.040]  Well, maybe, but, you know, I'm still breathing, and I think I have a good reason to be paranoid.
[02:42:05.380 --> 02:42:08.701]  I'm always out on the edge doing things that people don't want me to do.
[02:42:09.201 --> 02:42:14.202]  I'm sure the government does not want me to do something which is going to make the NSA powerless to get into your life.
[02:42:14.743 --> 02:42:20.804]  Well, you know, they're obviously going to try to stop me legally by saying, well, what you're producing is not good, we're not going to let you do it.
[02:42:21.671 --> 02:42:23.132]  Well, then I'm going to produce it somewhere else.
[02:42:23.192 --> 02:42:24.292]  I'm going to sell it somewhere else.
[02:42:25.052 --> 02:42:27.813]  But the technology is coming because people have to handle it.
[02:42:27.833 --> 02:42:30.354]  Without privacy, we have no individuality.
[02:42:30.714 --> 02:42:31.815]  We become a machine.
[02:42:32.455 --> 02:42:32.975]  I don't want that.
[02:42:33.035 --> 02:42:33.676]  You don't want that.
[02:42:34.596 --> 02:42:38.977]  And ultimately, the world will look at itself and say, wait a minute, we have gone crazier.
[02:42:39.338 --> 02:42:40.158]  And things will change.
[02:42:41.104 --> 02:42:50.087]  Yeah, for those that don't know, sociologists, anthropologists, psychologists, historians, all have found one element that is the most important for freedom and creativity, and that's privacy.
[02:42:50.487 --> 02:42:55.028]  Privacy, they don't even fully understand it, but if you don't have privacy, you're a slave.
[02:42:55.328 --> 02:42:56.528]  It's a very simple equation.
[02:42:58.449 --> 02:43:01.590]  Why is that, John McAfee?
[02:43:02.010 --> 02:43:04.511]  Why do we have to have privacy?
[02:43:04.551 --> 02:43:05.531]  Why is it so important?
[02:43:07.051 --> 02:43:08.872]  Because without privacy, sir,
[02:43:09.955 --> 02:43:14.878]  We have, because we're humans, and because we are imperfect, we get judged.
[02:43:14.898 --> 02:43:17.179]  Alright, why do we do certain things in privacy?
[02:43:17.239 --> 02:43:22.762]  Well, because, you know, we know that what we're doing here might offend somebody's sensibility somewhere else.
[02:43:23.943 --> 02:43:31.127]  What we're doing here, someone may not want us to do because of, who knows what, competition, greed, all of the things that humans have.
[02:43:31.447 --> 02:43:34.489]  Privacy is our protection against ourselves.
[02:43:35.390 --> 02:43:36.671]  All humans have the same thing.
[02:43:36.711 --> 02:43:38.333]  We are all, to some extent, greedy.
[02:43:38.353 --> 02:43:40.335]  We are all, to some extent, jealous.
[02:43:40.735 --> 02:43:43.679]  We are all, to some extent, lustful and all of the other things.
[02:43:44.219 --> 02:43:48.824]  And given that fact, privacy is our protection against ourselves.
[02:43:49.125 --> 02:43:51.908]  When we can go and do things which really are innocent,
[02:43:52.765 --> 02:43:55.848]  Without people becoming afraid of what we might be doing.
[02:43:56.428 --> 02:43:58.810]  And so, we all have to have it.
[02:43:59.170 --> 02:44:02.773]  It's a necessity of life if we are to be individuals.
[02:44:03.234 --> 02:44:08.578]  Now, if we're in some communist state where we all think alike and dress alike and there is no change, well, you don't need privacy.
[02:44:09.239 --> 02:44:10.640]  But then there are no people as well.
[02:44:11.080 --> 02:44:12.161]  We are robots.
[02:44:12.942 --> 02:44:16.885]  The question is, do we have the courage to remain human?
[02:44:16.905 --> 02:44:18.607]  I don't know.
[02:44:20.748 --> 02:44:22.770]  Well, I want to apologize to you, John.
[02:44:22.810 --> 02:44:23.890]  You probably don't even know why.
[02:44:23.970 --> 02:44:27.533]  The few times you came on our show first, I was respectful, I was nice to you.
[02:44:27.953 --> 02:44:37.780]  But the story was so wild, I was hedging my bets thinking, I know the guy's really smart, you know, he's really successful, I know it's the mainstream media demonizing him, so I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.
[02:44:38.121 --> 02:44:43.445]  But I was still, you know, a little sarcastic, a little hesitant, but now seeing everything you talked about,
[02:44:44.145 --> 02:44:45.006]  No need to apologize.
[02:44:45.026 --> 02:44:47.568]  You were actually the kindest of all people to me during that time.
[02:44:47.608 --> 02:44:48.088]  You really were.
[02:44:48.108 --> 02:44:49.069]  So I thank you again.
[02:45:07.219 --> 02:45:07.479]  Wow.
[02:45:07.559 --> 02:45:09.541]  Well, John, have you ever come through Austin?
[02:45:09.561 --> 02:45:10.782]  We'd like to get you in studio.
[02:45:10.822 --> 02:45:19.570]  In fact, I'd like to do a Skype interview for my Obama Deception 2 on privacy, so talk to your folks when you can get to video Skype and want to do a 10-minute interview.
[02:45:19.590 --> 02:45:31.461]  I have a few questions for the film, but as soon as you come out with this device, if we're able to sell it in the U.S., I would like to be a distributor through the InfoWars.com network of your products, sir.
[02:45:31.481 --> 02:45:33.343]  It's a done deal, sir.
[02:45:33.874 --> 02:45:34.074]  Wow.
[02:45:34.615 --> 02:45:35.155]  Very exciting.
[02:45:35.175 --> 02:45:36.136]  Okay, we'll stay in touch.
[02:45:36.777 --> 02:45:37.437]  I'll let you go.
[02:45:37.798 --> 02:45:46.466]  Anything else you'd like to add, please add it, but please look in your book and tell us the next time you can give us 10 minutes via Skype so I can put you in Obama Deception 2, the film, sir.
[02:45:47.187 --> 02:45:48.128]  All right, I will do that.
[02:45:48.168 --> 02:45:50.270]  As soon as I get off the phone, I'll call my people.
[02:45:50.290 --> 02:45:50.990]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[02:45:51.050 --> 02:45:52.031]  All right, thank you, John.
[02:45:52.051 --> 02:45:52.552]  We'll talk soon.
[02:45:54.175 --> 02:45:55.356]  Yeah, that guy's amazing.
[02:45:56.116 --> 02:45:57.256]  Again, I gotta be honest.
[02:45:57.276 --> 02:45:58.377]  I mean, I said this on air, too.
[02:45:58.397 --> 02:46:01.058]  I mean, it was so fantastic what he was saying.
[02:46:01.158 --> 02:46:03.059]  Riots in Chinese.
[02:46:03.699 --> 02:46:07.401]  He was even saying the names of the Muslim groups that were there getting all this.
[02:46:07.441 --> 02:46:09.081]  And that's why they came after him.
[02:46:09.221 --> 02:46:12.903]  And then it all came out later that, indeed, just what he said was going on.
[02:46:14.465 --> 02:46:19.446]  We even sat on a TV interview with him once for like a month just because I didn't even know if I could air it.
[02:46:19.506 --> 02:46:20.247]  It was so wild.
[02:46:20.907 --> 02:46:22.067]  And then it turned out it was true.
[02:46:22.687 --> 02:46:25.128]  But that guy's just super smart, folks.
[02:46:25.628 --> 02:46:26.208]  You can just hear him.
[02:46:26.228 --> 02:46:29.309]  He has that, you know, like a lot smarter than I am.
[02:46:29.349 --> 02:46:30.610]  Like, I kind of get like that manic.
[02:46:30.930 --> 02:46:32.270]  You can tell he's a really smart guy.
[02:46:32.850 --> 02:46:36.471]  And there's the way he boils down privacy and what it means and why it's so important.
[02:46:37.292 --> 02:46:41.273]  I'm really mad at myself because I get this attitude of I don't care if they know what I'm doing.
[02:46:43.052 --> 02:46:44.033]  Now, of course, that's their argument.
[02:46:44.053 --> 02:46:45.994]  Well, if you don't care, that's on the NSA website.
[02:46:46.334 --> 02:46:48.356]  If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear.
[02:46:49.016 --> 02:46:50.898]  If you're not doing anything wrong, don't worry.
[02:46:52.219 --> 02:46:53.059]  It actually says that.
[02:46:53.400 --> 02:46:54.620]  That is the essence of tyranny.
[02:46:54.861 --> 02:46:57.783]  But then I double down on it and go, I know you crooks are watching me.
[02:46:58.103 --> 02:46:59.324]  I know you're raping my privacy.
[02:46:59.584 --> 02:47:00.325]  All right, whatever.
[02:47:01.826 --> 02:47:04.388]  But still, being macho about it is wrong.
[02:47:05.008 --> 02:47:07.830]  I should be doing everything I can to protect my privacy.
[02:47:08.450 --> 02:47:10.012]  I should be protecting my security.
[02:47:10.672 --> 02:47:14.574]  Like, it's a macho that I just strut around in public with no bodyguards, not caring.
[02:47:14.914 --> 02:47:15.834]  But I don't even do it on purpose.
[02:47:15.854 --> 02:47:16.755]  I really am not afraid.
[02:47:17.395 --> 02:47:18.435]  It is wild.
[02:47:18.475 --> 02:47:26.139]  Like, I've had, like, police detectives here and FBI people and others going, man, you're crazy to go do the stuff you do, you know, by yourself with no security and all this stuff.
[02:47:26.179 --> 02:47:31.361]  And the more I think about it is I have a responsibility to protect my privacy.
[02:47:31.701 --> 02:47:33.662]  I have a responsibility to protect my safety.
[02:47:34.742 --> 02:47:37.844]  And I think that's the essence of why America has fallen so far.
[02:47:39.051 --> 02:47:43.514]  Is that we just think, ah, so what if you scum are doing that, or we'll muddle through it.
[02:47:43.934 --> 02:47:46.356]  We have to stop just muddling through it and putting up with it.
[02:47:46.616 --> 02:47:48.037]  We've got to really take it personal.
[02:47:49.578 --> 02:47:57.803]  And get off the grid as much as we can, and then when we go interface with the internet, because this is a great tool to fight the globalists, but they're going to try to shut this down.
[02:47:58.223 --> 02:47:59.664]  We've got to be creating alternatives.
[02:47:59.704 --> 02:48:02.285]  We've got to be trying to be privacy oriented.
[02:48:02.506 --> 02:48:04.367]  We've got to use cash as much as possible.
[02:48:05.259 --> 02:48:06.760]  It's not that we've done something wrong.
[02:48:06.780 --> 02:48:08.101]  We've got to keep cash alive.
[02:48:08.541 --> 02:48:13.765]  Once they get the cashless grid in, they can tax the daylights out of us, track us, control us, and they admit that's their plan.
[02:48:14.586 --> 02:48:19.710]  I mean, you can hear McAvee, you know, with bated breath, he's, I can't believe it's happening, I can't believe it's happening, because it's really happening.
[02:48:20.010 --> 02:48:21.611]  They're really arresting reporters.
[02:48:21.991 --> 02:48:26.615]  They're really telling Catholic priests, we'll arrest you if you pray with somebody on military bases.
[02:48:27.335 --> 02:48:32.319]  They're really telling volunteers you can't meet with troops off base when they have a family member die.
[02:48:33.717 --> 02:48:37.002]  You can't go give a funeral for somebody's family.
[02:48:37.022 --> 02:48:38.665]  You can't give military burials.
[02:48:40.348 --> 02:48:41.529]  Oh yeah, they're not telling people.
[02:48:42.010 --> 02:48:43.953]  My great uncle had a military burial two months ago.
[02:48:45.095 --> 02:48:47.118]  They had guys come out and do the 21 gun salute.
[02:48:48.052 --> 02:48:56.181]  You know, do the army style thing where they walk in with a coffin and fold up the... They're talking about restricting those.
[02:48:56.521 --> 02:49:00.926]  And if we catch you in uniform volunteering, it's already volunteered anyways.
[02:49:01.507 --> 02:49:07.534]  I mean, it's disgusting what these people get away with and how we've let them walk all over us.
[02:49:07.694 --> 02:49:08.375]  I feel dirty.
[02:49:08.635 --> 02:49:09.376]  I feel pathetic.
[02:49:10.640 --> 02:49:13.202]  That's why so many times people say, oh, you're so great, you're so wonderful.
[02:49:13.262 --> 02:49:17.226]  Folks, I am not... It's not that I don't like being complimented.
[02:49:17.266 --> 02:49:17.886]  That's okay.
[02:49:18.006 --> 02:49:26.014]  It's that I am so upset that I'm not doing enough and that I can't do enough that when people tell me how great I am all day, I don't want you to do that.
[02:49:27.575 --> 02:49:28.656]  I'm not great, folks.
[02:49:29.657 --> 02:49:32.679]  We as a people are great if we rediscover our greatness and liberty.
[02:49:32.759 --> 02:49:34.381]  We've got to go out and fight these people.
[02:49:35.082 --> 02:49:36.162]  I mean, I want to go out
[02:49:37.088 --> 02:49:39.489]  And stick up bumper stickers all over town to wake people up.
[02:49:39.669 --> 02:49:42.630]  I want to go out and confront police running checkpoints.
[02:49:42.870 --> 02:49:45.971]  I want to go out and protest at an abortion clinic.
[02:49:46.392 --> 02:49:58.056]  I want to go to Fort Hood and walk into a general's office and say, how dare you follow illegal orders to not let people have church, now during a government shutdown, and tell them it doesn't matter if the priest, in the case of the Catholics, if I'm public.
[02:49:58.696 --> 02:49:59.837]  Uh, you know, minister to people.
[02:50:00.057 --> 02:50:01.198]  This is outrageous!
[02:50:01.238 --> 02:50:08.024]  We should be saying, and you know, they'll probably put me on some list saying we should go get in the General's face because I'm a terrorist for speaking out.
[02:50:08.044 --> 02:50:09.405]  I mean, it's disgusting!
[02:50:09.585 --> 02:50:17.172]  Everything good has been listed as terrorism under this fake threat of Al-Qaeda when they run Al-Qaeda publicly!
[02:50:17.412 --> 02:50:18.893]  They run the drugs publicly!
[02:50:20.034 --> 02:50:22.877]  And again, 95% of the government's not involved in the corruption.
[02:50:23.723 --> 02:50:28.607]  But they sit there and stand down and ignore it and are compartmentalized, which makes you complicit.
[02:50:28.627 --> 02:50:30.669]  Because here's another big epiphany.
[02:50:31.589 --> 02:50:32.850]  This stuff's all out now.
[02:50:34.392 --> 02:50:39.396]  And so all of you that work with the system and go along with it, you're now complicit, on record.
[02:50:40.076 --> 02:50:44.080]  It's gone way past the point of you being able to deny this and have plausible deniability.
[02:50:44.820 --> 02:50:45.861]  And here's another big epiphany.
[02:50:46.462 --> 02:50:47.763]  This is the biggest secret yet.
[02:50:48.203 --> 02:50:50.285]  I know you already know this in your gut, but we haven't said it.
[02:50:51.335 --> 02:50:57.483]  If they get away with all this now, with it being so naked, next they really are going to come arrest everybody and build giant death camps.
[02:50:58.444 --> 02:51:00.026]  Now I really believe that.
[02:51:00.407 --> 02:51:01.628]  I've always known it's a possibility.
[02:51:01.668 --> 02:51:02.549]  Now I'm sure.
[02:51:03.270 --> 02:51:06.154]  We have got the nastiest case of tyranny I've ever seen.
[02:51:06.174 --> 02:51:07.435]  God help us.

[02:52:25.536 --> 02:52:26.196]  I'm a cyclist.
[02:52:26.456 --> 02:52:28.977]  Normally I'll ride two days on and take two days off.
[02:52:29.477 --> 02:52:39.239]  After being on One World Way, I rode 10 days in a row in over 100 degree heat and then I take another two servings of One World Way and then work out at the gym for another hour and a half.
[02:52:39.599 --> 02:52:41.300]  I just couldn't believe these results.
[02:52:41.800 --> 02:52:45.321]  My normal muscle tightness and soreness after working out are virtually gone.
[02:52:45.981 --> 02:52:47.101]  Don't take my word for it.
[02:52:47.481 --> 02:52:49.102]  One World Way comes in single servings.
[02:52:49.522 --> 02:52:50.402]  Just give it a try.

[02:53:18.105 --> 02:53:20.386]  We'll stop it and most pistol rounds.

[02:53:38.939 --> 02:53:48.205]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it lent back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[02:53:48.245 --> 02:53:48.985]  This capitalism?
[02:53:49.046 --> 02:53:55.169]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:53:55.209 --> 02:53:58.852]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[02:53:58.912 --> 02:53:59.812]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[02:53:59.832 --> 02:54:01.173]  It's time to understand the system.
[02:54:01.233 --> 02:54:01.513]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:54:01.554 --> 02:54:01.834]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:54:13.697 --> 02:54:16.879]  There's a man comin' round takin' names.
[02:54:20.200 --> 02:54:23.462]  There's a man goin' round takin' names.
[02:54:24.963 --> 02:54:28.205]  And he decides who to free and who to blame.
[02:54:30.566 --> 02:54:33.387]  Everybody will be treated all the same.
[02:54:35.228 --> 02:54:39.631]  There'll be a golden ladder reaching down when the man comes around.
[02:54:43.429 --> 02:54:51.955]  I'm a new overdrive so I can get to Dylan and Gary and Bob and Alan and Barry.
[02:54:51.995 --> 02:54:53.416]  I'll at least get to those five calls.
[02:54:53.896 --> 02:54:57.118]  Folks listening on channel 244 on XM, Gary and others.
[02:54:57.558 --> 02:54:58.078]  We're gonna get to you.
[02:54:58.098 --> 02:54:58.939]  I appreciate you holding.
[02:54:58.979 --> 02:55:02.982]  You get on hold and I start getting guests on and then it gets behind and I apologize.
[02:55:03.042 --> 02:55:09.426]  Briefly, it is sponsors that make this broadcast possible and one of them is simply just so fantastic.

[02:55:17.122 --> 02:55:18.305]  We know the Globalists are digging in.
[02:55:18.385 --> 02:55:21.811]  I've said repeatedly on the show that they are moving up their endgame.
[02:55:22.777 --> 02:55:27.038]  The day is coming when America as we know it and love it will be distant memory if they have their way.
[02:55:27.078 --> 02:55:27.998]  They want to make us dependent.
[02:55:28.578 --> 02:55:30.419]  So the answer is to get prepared.
[02:55:30.479 --> 02:55:32.800]  Patriots everywhere are using the best supplier out there.

[02:55:49.084 --> 02:55:50.144]  And speaking of
[02:55:52.796 --> 02:55:54.657]  Callers, let's go ahead and go to those right now.
[02:55:54.777 --> 02:55:56.058]  Dylan, in Italy.
[02:55:56.078 --> 02:55:57.519]  I didn't even know you've been holding forever from Italy.
[02:55:57.539 --> 02:55:58.839]  I didn't even look at the screen.
[02:55:59.260 --> 02:56:00.800]  Dylan, thank you for calling in.
[02:56:00.840 --> 02:56:01.741]  What's on your mind today?
[02:56:03.122 --> 02:56:03.702]  Hello, Alex.
[02:56:03.762 --> 02:56:07.064]  I'd like to talk to you about a H.R.
[02:56:07.084 --> 02:56:10.626]  3210 bill called Pay Our Military Act.
[02:56:10.646 --> 02:56:14.368]  It was signed on the 30th of September by President Obama.
[02:56:15.863 --> 02:56:26.151]  Um, stating, uh, you know, trying to get the military paid because, uh, as of right now, um, active duty military, uh, the Reserves and the National Guard are no longer going to be paid.
[02:56:27.092 --> 02:56:34.918]  Um, it says here that military members cannot be paid for duty performed after the expiration of the current CRA on September 30th.
[02:56:38.462 --> 02:56:39.543]  Yes, I'm familiar with that.
[02:56:39.904 --> 02:56:42.086]  And that basically just keeps Obamacare going.
[02:56:42.166 --> 02:56:47.112]  It's all deadlock with both sides trying to act like they're the ones that are trying to get the government going.
[02:56:47.192 --> 02:56:48.814]  It is Obama that is obstructing.
[02:56:49.555 --> 02:56:57.164]  It is the Republicans that are trying to strip out the really criminal stuff in the Obamacare.
[02:56:57.184 --> 02:56:58.866]  But what's your overall take on this?
[02:57:00.567 --> 02:57:03.532]  Um, overall, it's kind of unbelievable.
[02:57:04.033 --> 02:57:12.328]  It says here they're going to be paid up until September 30th, and after that, there is no money going to active duty, reserve, or National Guard members.
[02:57:13.049 --> 02:57:16.752]  Well, Obama says he's going to sign that bill, so that means it's passed.
[02:57:16.772 --> 02:57:17.733]  Here it is from Politico.
[02:57:18.153 --> 02:57:22.057]  President Obama plans to sign a last-minute bill authorizing paychecks for troops.
[02:57:22.617 --> 02:57:27.261]  The Republicans are sending a bunch of, like, tailored bills that they can all agree on.
[02:57:27.281 --> 02:57:30.043]  I mean, they're up there actually trying to get that stuff passed.
[02:57:30.504 --> 02:57:37.549]  The House passed the bill to ensure the military is paid, was approved without dissent in the Senate on Monday, a rare bipartisan agreement.
[02:57:37.850 --> 02:57:40.152]  What, are Democrats telling you that still hasn't gone through?
[02:57:41.998 --> 02:57:49.083]  I'm not sure who's telling me it exactly, but it says here that, however, there is no Treasury warrant to allow payments.
[02:57:50.284 --> 02:57:55.488]  Alright, well the issue is the bill was passed a week ago and signed by Obama, so there you go.
[02:57:55.508 --> 02:57:56.468]  I appreciate your call.
[02:57:56.969 --> 02:58:02.593]  Sounds like more Democratic disinfo to me being put out there, but we'll have to track it.
[02:58:03.173 --> 02:58:04.494]  Let's jam in one more before we go to break.
[02:58:04.674 --> 02:58:05.795]  Allen in Delaware, welcome.
[02:58:07.563 --> 02:58:09.444]  Hi Alex, it's good to talk to you again.
[02:58:09.464 --> 02:58:11.605]  I want to discuss something here.
[02:58:11.745 --> 02:58:12.965]  Are you familiar with UNESCO?
[02:58:14.106 --> 02:58:14.786]  Yes, yes.
[02:58:15.766 --> 02:58:20.488]  The United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization.
[02:58:20.508 --> 02:58:24.350]  That's the global agenda 21 for education, healthcare, eugenics.
[02:58:24.750 --> 02:58:28.532]  That's what Aldous Huxley's brother started as the Director General of UNESCO.
[02:58:28.832 --> 02:58:30.893]  That's what our national parks have been signed over to.
[02:58:31.333 --> 02:58:33.234]  Our kids have been signed over to it as collateral.
[02:58:33.274 --> 02:58:33.994]  Yes sir, what about it?
[02:58:34.727 --> 02:58:37.973]  And we are absolutely no longer the United States of America.
[02:58:38.313 --> 02:58:41.299]  Now, I just got done reading Steve Alton's The Shell Game.
[02:58:41.339 --> 02:58:42.841]  Talks about oil, the Saudis.
[02:58:43.262 --> 02:58:45.205]  What I want to get to is... Well, I'll tell you what, stay there.
[02:58:45.225 --> 02:58:45.826]  No, it's true.
[02:58:46.047 --> 02:58:47.289]  We're already in the world government.
[02:58:47.489 --> 02:58:47.589]  Yep.
[02:58:50.182 --> 02:58:51.284]  They say they actually own us.
[02:58:51.404 --> 02:58:52.746]  We're going into overdrive.
[02:58:52.766 --> 02:58:55.990]  I'm going to go back to Alan, then Gary, and others.
[02:58:56.071 --> 02:58:56.571]  Stay with us.

[02:59:03.802 --> 02:59:06.526]  An outbreak of contagious disease can happen anywhere.
[02:59:06.826 --> 02:59:09.367]  And the threat of bioterrorism is always at hand.
[02:59:09.668 --> 02:59:15.071]  Because we're faced with more diseases than ever before, we need a better solution than ever before.
[02:59:15.471 --> 02:59:19.013]  Fortunately, there's a simple, effective way to protect yourself.

[03:00:20.564 --> 03:00:21.464]  Well, so does he.

[03:00:26.306 --> 03:00:30.408]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:30.768 --> 03:00:32.048]  Alright, Allen in Delaware.
[03:00:32.369 --> 03:00:37.431]  Make your point about United Nations Cultural Educational Organization, UNESCO.
[03:00:37.471 --> 03:00:37.771]  Go ahead.
[03:00:38.527 --> 03:00:42.929]  Alright Alex, in my hands I have reinventing government, fast bullets and culture changes.
[03:00:43.329 --> 03:00:45.230]  I've read it cover to cover three times.
[03:00:45.610 --> 03:00:49.312]  I want people to know that this is a 75 plus year program.
[03:00:49.592 --> 03:00:52.074]  The CIA is involved, Bill Clinton is orchestrated.
[03:00:52.334 --> 03:01:02.839]  The Bushes are the biggest Nazis that ever entered our- By the way, I have a 1937 New York Times showing the 10 FEMA regions, even though FEMA wasn't set up until 1979.
[03:01:03.979 --> 03:01:05.340]  I have that New York Times article.
[03:01:05.360 --> 03:01:06.501]  I mean, it's all a total plan.
[03:01:06.521 --> 03:01:07.101]  You're absolutely right.
[03:01:07.816 --> 03:01:10.197]  It's absolutely a plan that's in its end games.
[03:01:10.237 --> 03:01:12.538]  We're at five minutes to midnight on the death clock.
[03:01:12.958 --> 03:01:28.184]  If you don't wake up and start protesting and get your children out of school, and the last thing I'm going to say right here, right now, and I'm not playing games here from everything I've read, is that when Dick Cheney discussed dirty bombs in this country in 2008, they are here.
[03:01:28.504 --> 03:01:36.187]  There are a dozen plus of them, and they're going to use them in the next 24 months, guaranteed.
[03:01:38.410 --> 03:01:43.573]  Yeah, they got a lot of nasty stuff playing for us, and we'll have to watch the people that did it pose as saviors on TV.
[03:01:44.513 --> 03:01:46.615]  That's why everybody's really getting upset deep down.
[03:01:46.655 --> 03:01:48.536]  People know we are five minutes to midnight.
[03:01:48.556 --> 03:01:49.216]  You're absolutely right.
[03:01:50.277 --> 03:01:52.238]  March 1st, 2014.
[03:01:52.318 --> 03:01:52.978]  March 1st.
[03:01:53.018 --> 03:01:53.738]  Talk later.
[03:01:54.079 --> 03:01:55.439]  I've been doing this for three years.
[03:01:55.459 --> 03:01:56.000]  No, I hear you, brother.
[03:01:56.020 --> 03:01:58.981]  I gotta jump and get to the people I promised to, but here's the deal.
[03:01:59.502 --> 03:02:00.922]  People are like, but that'll ruin things.
[03:02:00.962 --> 03:02:01.863]  That'll make things bad.
[03:02:02.043 --> 03:02:03.063]  We're being conquered.
[03:02:03.384 --> 03:02:05.545]  This is a military globalist operation.
[03:02:06.445 --> 03:02:08.806]  They don't care if they kill 200 million of us to take over.
[03:02:09.526 --> 03:02:10.406]  They're that bad!
[03:02:11.286 --> 03:02:12.627]  Okay, it's conscious evil.
[03:02:12.687 --> 03:02:14.247]  I cannot explain that to people enough.
[03:02:15.508 --> 03:02:17.268]  These are evil people running things.
[03:02:17.708 --> 03:02:20.369]  Let's talk to Gary in New York, listening on XM244.
[03:02:20.689 --> 03:02:21.430]  Go ahead.
[03:02:21.450 --> 03:02:24.070]  Hey Alex, this is Gary.
[03:02:25.051 --> 03:02:31.273]  I just had an idea that possibly could happen.
[03:02:31.413 --> 03:02:33.913]  I'm starting to learn a little bit more about Russian history.
[03:02:33.973 --> 03:02:35.514]  If I'm not mistaken, didn't they
[03:02:36.538 --> 03:02:41.020]  Let the prisoners out of, you know, out of jail and whatnot.
[03:02:41.060 --> 03:02:48.962]  Yeah, Lenin took the prisoners and then used them as frontline torture troops against the Russian Christians.
[03:02:49.383 --> 03:02:52.804]  But then Stalin took them in World War II and made them the commanders.
[03:02:54.184 --> 03:03:01.987]  Okay, so now if they were to do that same thing here, do the prisons, do they coincide with the FEMA camp regions?
[03:03:02.631 --> 03:03:07.993]  Well, I mean, back then it was like bank robbers, swindlers, people for key positions.
[03:03:08.033 --> 03:03:09.194]  Most prisoners stayed in jail.
[03:03:09.454 --> 03:03:12.235]  Most of our prisoners are there on victimless crimes or wimps.
[03:03:12.915 --> 03:03:13.275]  I mean, no.
[03:03:13.315 --> 03:03:17.677]  I mean, if you're a hardcore psychopathic killer that, you know, is a master criminal, they'll hire you.
[03:03:18.417 --> 03:03:20.418]  And then kill you after a few years of service.
[03:03:20.438 --> 03:03:21.699]  But yes, they will hire criminals.
[03:03:21.979 --> 03:03:22.599]  They already are.
[03:03:22.779 --> 03:03:23.459]  They are criminals.
[03:03:25.520 --> 03:03:26.961]  We are run by a criminal enterprise.
[03:03:28.069 --> 03:03:28.650]  I totally agree.
[03:03:28.810 --> 03:03:41.310]  I just think that the, you know, I've always wondered why there are a lot of people that are in jail are allowed to be in their lift and weights and, you know, they're in better condition than, you know, Americans outside.
[03:03:42.162 --> 03:03:44.723]  Well, they want them big and strong to be able to come out and abuse people.
[03:03:44.743 --> 03:03:49.765]  They have actuaries where they release the violent criminals to abuse people so they can call for more police.
[03:03:49.825 --> 03:03:52.786]  It's all been scientifically broken down, and that's all been published.
[03:03:52.826 --> 03:03:53.686]  Yes, you're good points.
[03:03:55.147 --> 03:03:59.208]  Actually, they have them with lights and stuff so they don't kill each other, but that is part of it.
[03:03:59.549 --> 03:04:01.149]  Clockwork Orange is about that, the book.
[03:04:01.809 --> 03:04:03.350]  Barry in Illinois, you're on the air.
[03:04:03.370 --> 03:04:03.730]  Go ahead.
[03:04:03.750 --> 03:04:07.131]  Mr. Jones, it's a pleasure to speak to you today.
[03:04:07.251 --> 03:04:07.492]  Yes, sir.
[03:04:07.512 --> 03:04:08.332]  We've got one minute, brother.
[03:04:09.364 --> 03:04:19.468]  Um, as a veteran called out of the military to be a pastor for God and fight for government in these times, one of our founding fathers said, give me liberty or give me death.
[03:04:20.168 --> 03:04:27.471]  Well, when I turn on the TV and I see they've shut down the Statue of Liberty, they don't allow you to get near the Liberty Bell.
[03:04:28.041 --> 03:04:39.086]  I don't understand why this is not our country's cry right now, and I fear that our country is on the wrong side of Bible prophecy, but I want to give the people hope, and let them to remember that the victory is not in our hands.
[03:04:39.126 --> 03:04:42.288]  The fight is among us, but the victory is going to be with Jesus.
[03:04:42.308 --> 03:04:49.291]  He's going to come back, and He's going to defeat this evil, because we battle not against flesh and bones, but against principalities and spirits.
[03:04:49.751 --> 03:04:50.772]  Well, I agree with you.
[03:04:50.832 --> 03:04:54.554]  Like Nineveh, we could be given a reprieve if our churches weren't run by the devil.
[03:04:55.316 --> 03:05:07.262]  And that's why it's important for lay pastors and people to go out and be the salt of the earth, because the churches are now eyes of Mordor, most of them, serving the New World Order and its agenda.
[03:05:09.604 --> 03:05:15.207]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[03:05:15.347 --> 03:05:16.247]  Radiation levels.
[03:05:16.568 --> 03:05:22.050]  Soap that is triple concentrated and made from the highest quality vegetable and coconut oils.
[03:05:22.671 --> 03:05:23.531]  See them on the web.
