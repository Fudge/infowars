[00:00:02.185 --> 00:00:06.687]  You're listening to GCN, the world leader in independent talk radio.
[00:00:13.888 --> 00:00:18.072]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:18.712 --> 00:00:19.533]  You want answers?
[00:00:20.314 --> 00:00:21.194]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:25.438]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.122]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:59.894]  There is no question that we have made many important strides in securing our country from terrorism since 9-11.
[00:01:08.116 --> 00:01:10.257]  But the threat continues to evolve.
[00:01:25.027 --> 00:01:31.198]  And in some ways, the threat today may be at its most heightened state since the attacks nearly 10 years ago.
[00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:39.574]  But I think if you just take those three pieces of evidence right there, and AI-2 plus 2 plus 2, you have the U.S.
[00:01:39.594 --> 00:01:43.397]  government letting Mutalab on the plane with an intentionally defective bomb.
[00:01:43.818 --> 00:01:51.224]  The war on terror is a fraud, and it's being used in a manner to take away your rights for whatever reason.
[00:01:51.664 --> 00:02:05.757]  In addition to the core Al-Qaeda group, which still represents a threat to the United States despite its diminished capabilities, we now face threats from a number of Al-Qaeda associates that share its violent extremist ideology.
[00:02:06.678 --> 00:02:13.745]  Among these groups, we are also seeing an increased emphasis on recruiting Americans and Westerners to carry out attacks.
[00:02:18.837 --> 00:02:30.624]  They are also encouraging individuals in the West to carry out their own small-scale attacks, which require less of the coordination and planning that could raise red flags and lead to an attack's disruption.
[00:02:37.717 --> 00:02:42.438]  In my 16 years of deep research, it has become clear.
[00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:47.360]  The number one threat to any sovereign free nation is its military.
[00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.381]  Look at Nazi Germany, look at Latin America, look at Asia, look at Africa, look at Eastern Europe.
[00:02:53.042 --> 00:03:01.224]  When you build up a giant paramilitary police force, it almost always tries to take over the society.
[00:03:02.485 --> 00:03:03.085]  In the last 12 years,
[00:03:04.704 --> 00:03:07.425]  We've watched an acceleration of militarization of police.
[00:03:07.465 --> 00:03:08.985]  We've watched threat fusion centers.
[00:03:09.385 --> 00:03:11.066]  The 10 FEMA regions expand.
[00:03:11.126 --> 00:03:12.606]  The Governor's Council.
[00:03:12.706 --> 00:03:19.508]  I've been to urban warfare drills where our own military is training to lock down and barricade and blockade U.S.
[00:03:19.528 --> 00:03:21.668]  cities and confiscate our firearms.
[00:03:22.628 --> 00:03:24.569]  This whole program accelerated.
[00:03:25.385 --> 00:03:37.335]  After 1999, when Congress got rid of the Glass-Steagall Act, it allowed private central banks to issue unlimited counterfeit financial insurance, known as derivatives.
[00:03:38.576 --> 00:03:43.881]  And we've heard that, oh, the military and the police state, the TSA, it's for Al-Qaeda.
[00:03:45.043 --> 00:03:50.508]  But now we see checkpoints in Tennessee run by the Army, shutting down highways, searching citizens.
[00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:53.852]  We see them in New York State with x-ray machines.
[00:03:53.892 --> 00:03:55.013]  We see it all over the nation.
[00:03:55.433 --> 00:03:59.597]  We see Marines running illegal checkpoints for DUI in California.
[00:04:00.178 --> 00:04:03.861]  And when the governors and others complain, they're told sit down and shut up.
[00:04:04.382 --> 00:04:06.184]  It's under Homeland Security.
[00:04:06.564 --> 00:04:08.386]  It's under continuity of government.
[00:04:09.628 --> 00:04:29.151]  And now, as the world implodes, as the derivatives dollar devaluation crisis expands, we're seeing the police and military being called out against the general population all over the world as people go under austerity, as their pension funds are cut, as their benefits are cut but their taxes go up.
[00:04:30.239 --> 00:04:38.206]  And here domestically in the U.S., this huge apparatus of oppression is openly being set up and deployed against the people.
[00:04:38.626 --> 00:04:49.656]  And I saw an amazing blurb from Business Insider that linked to an article and the audio of the governor of Wisconsin on NPR saying, hey, we're cutting all these state employees.
[00:04:50.848 --> 00:04:55.871]  And we're going to make you pay more of your paycheck into a pension fund, which they loot out the back door.
[00:04:56.331 --> 00:05:01.453]  And if you don't like it, we're going to use the National Guard on you.
[00:05:02.434 --> 00:05:05.996]  And on the heels of the governor's speech, and just in case... Folks, we're live.
[00:05:06.196 --> 00:05:06.876]  It's Friday.
[00:05:07.656 --> 00:05:08.337]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:09.554 --> 00:05:14.458]  The world is discovering the power of medicinal silver to fight against life-threatening pathogens.
[00:05:15.059 --> 00:05:18.322]  And as a result, dozens of silver solutions have emerged.
[00:05:18.882 --> 00:05:21.764]  You can even make your own colloidal silver at home in your garage.
[00:05:22.305 --> 00:05:25.127]  How do you know which solution is the safest and most effective?
[00:05:25.748 --> 00:05:31.773]  Supernatural Silver is a new patented technology that is made using 10,000 volts of AC current.
[00:05:32.374 --> 00:05:35.837]  This technology is so powerful, it must be made in a laboratory.
[00:05:36.437 --> 00:05:47.143]  Colloidal and ionic silvers use a charge of only 110 volts of DC current, making supernatural silver hundreds of times more effective against viruses, bacteria, and fungus.
[00:05:47.843 --> 00:05:52.806]  Supernatural silver liquid can be used internally, and our silver gel can be used topically.
[00:05:53.346 --> 00:06:01.190]  To find out more information on how Supernatural Silver can help you win the war against deadly pathogens, go to SupernaturalSilver.com.

[00:06:11.915 --> 00:06:19.459]  Why do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year, betting their lives that the disaster won't get them?
[00:06:21.684 --> 00:06:22.204]  We're good to go.

[00:07:12.263 --> 00:07:18.286]  But when it comes to protecting your family, your home, and belongings, there's no need to sign a long-term contract.
[00:07:18.646 --> 00:07:25.030]  Listen, there is some real scum in the alarm business cashing in by locking you into long, punishing contracts.

[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:32.485]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[00:08:32.825 --> 00:08:34.467]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:41.393 --> 00:08:54.244]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live!
[00:08:55.848 --> 00:09:01.313]  It is Friday, the 13th day of September 2013.
[00:09:01.874 --> 00:09:07.178]  We're going to be here for the next three hours.
[00:09:08.279 --> 00:09:13.144]  We have former CIA analyst and advisor Ronald Reagan and George Bush Sr.
[00:09:13.564 --> 00:09:18.909]  Ray McGovern coming on to talk about the global crises in Syria with his inside take on that and more.
[00:09:21.386 --> 00:09:26.051]  We have a lot of amazing news here, a lot of amazing mainstream admissions.
[00:09:26.251 --> 00:09:36.662]  CNET News of CBS News is reporting that NSA disguised itself as Google to spy, say declassified reports.
[00:09:37.083 --> 00:09:41.387]  Ladies and gentlemen, Google is the NSA, as I've been telling you for a decade.
[00:09:42.108 --> 00:09:54.151]  Google was founded by the CIA with In-Q-Tel money, their aircraft are based at NASA and military bases, and they get military fuel and military fuel prices.
[00:09:54.971 --> 00:10:04.554]  As this has been exposed and lawsuits have been filed by competitors that it is a monopoly and unfair trade practices, this is being revealed.
[00:10:05.074 --> 00:10:08.275]  But Google is the new world order.
[00:10:10.668 --> 00:10:26.958]  The people running it, the people in control of the situation, like to create private companies to then give the government contracts and technologies to that were paid for by the taxpayers via the military-industrial complex that controls 95% now.
[00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:32.102]  Used to be 90 back in Eisenhower's day.
[00:10:33.763 --> 00:10:37.886]  95% of R&D, research and development.
[00:10:37.926 --> 00:10:40.088]  So there's that type of news.
[00:10:40.148 --> 00:10:45.632]  Oh, speaking of DARPA, DARPA's plan to flood the sea with drones, carrying more drones.
[00:10:45.672 --> 00:10:47.753]  We're going to be getting into that today.
[00:10:48.594 --> 00:10:52.817]  Also, Paul Watson has a story up on InfoWars.com.
[00:10:56.084 --> 00:10:57.365]  That is very important.
[00:10:57.725 --> 00:11:01.487]  In fact, I want to link this in red right now and move it to the top.
[00:11:01.987 --> 00:11:08.711]  Leader of Syrian rebel group calls for attacks inside the United States.
[00:11:09.472 --> 00:11:09.572]  Oh!
[00:11:10.212 --> 00:11:13.694]  And he just also just happens to be the head of Al-Qaeda.
[00:11:14.154 --> 00:11:23.560]  Now, Paul Watson took the report out of the London Telegraph today reporting on how the head of Al-Qaeda is calling for attacks in the U.S.
[00:11:24.881 --> 00:11:31.383]  He's also the head of al-Nusra, that is the main jihadi force being given U.S.
[00:11:31.403 --> 00:11:35.984]  aid to attack the embattled Syrian government.
[00:11:37.184 --> 00:11:40.745]  Now think about how that's hidden in plain view.
[00:11:40.845 --> 00:11:42.726]  Think about the magnitude of that.
[00:11:42.766 --> 00:11:44.886]  We're going to be getting into that in great detail today.
[00:11:45.906 --> 00:11:51.768]  Also, California lawmakers approve measure to allow driver's license
[00:11:53.066 --> 00:11:54.347]  For illegal immigrants.
[00:11:54.387 --> 00:12:04.676]  Yes, the total legalization of illegals, allowing them to vote with no ID, and of course they then vote to take everybody's guns and to flood the country to drive down wages.
[00:12:04.716 --> 00:12:06.777]  It's all going quite nicely.
[00:12:07.118 --> 00:12:13.483]  Also, the Daily Mail is reporting on new reports put out by NASA and other major groups.
[00:12:13.803 --> 00:12:18.607]  It's now global cooling record return of Arctic ice caps as it grows by 60% in the last year.
[00:12:22.372 --> 00:12:23.873]  You can go see those satellite photos.
[00:12:23.933 --> 00:12:33.940]  Now, I just plagued you two weeks ago, CNN saying it's all basically melted, the polar bears can't swim and are drowning, and that we're all basically dead if we don't pay Al Gore money.
[00:12:34.841 --> 00:12:37.803]  There are five times the polar bears that there were in surveys in 1955.
[00:12:38.883 --> 00:12:39.324]  Look that up.
[00:12:39.604 --> 00:12:40.084]  Five times.
[00:12:40.745 --> 00:12:41.245]  Five times.
[00:12:41.845 --> 00:12:42.346]  Five times.
[00:12:42.926 --> 00:12:43.407]  Five times.
[00:12:44.366 --> 00:12:46.087]  They have the greatest land animal swimmer.
[00:12:46.467 --> 00:12:48.309]  Recorded swimming over 250 miles.
[00:12:48.989 --> 00:12:49.369]  On record.
[00:12:49.649 --> 00:12:49.950]  Boom!
[00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:50.910]  Numbers exploding.
[00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:51.491]  Boom!
[00:12:52.651 --> 00:12:54.613]  Ice caps getting bigger than ever.
[00:12:54.813 --> 00:12:55.113]  Boom!
[00:12:55.253 --> 00:12:55.673]  On record.
[00:12:56.033 --> 00:12:56.854]  It doesn't matter.
[00:12:57.234 --> 00:13:07.701]  CNN gets up there and says it's all melting and shows you a satellite shot of the spring and summer when it always contracts and then expands in the fall and the winter.
[00:13:09.501 --> 00:13:21.126]  All the major top scientists are now admitting right now that the ice cap in the north and the south are getting very large and they're worried about a new ice age.
[00:13:22.787 --> 00:13:27.068]  Oh, but don't worry, you pay Al Gore money, he will fix that as well.
[00:13:27.408 --> 00:13:32.650]  You can sell him your oceanfront property that he says is going to flood because he's been buying it up as fast as he can.
[00:13:35.069 --> 00:13:37.871]  This is the type of garbage that we deal with.
[00:13:38.012 --> 00:13:47.540]  And yesterday I went home a little bit early at about 5.30 to see my family and I almost stayed here because it was so incredible.
[00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:50.923]  They had Fox News on back there in the kitchen.
[00:13:52.406 --> 00:14:07.336]  And they had Samantha Powers, the spokeswoman for the State Department and the envoy to the UN, up there like she was a fashion model, slinging her red hair around, just thinking that she was on the runway or that she was about to pole dance.
[00:14:07.416 --> 00:14:10.478]  I mean, she had that, you know, trying to put the sex appeal on.
[00:14:10.658 --> 00:14:11.718]  I'm a movie star.
[00:14:12.259 --> 00:14:13.620]  Oh, I'm such a rock star.
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:16.982]  No, you're a war whore, is what you are, and a fraud.
[00:14:17.522 --> 00:14:18.403]  Oh, but she's a feminist.
[00:14:18.423 --> 00:14:18.943]  She's liberal.
[00:14:19.183 --> 00:14:21.585]  It's trendy when she launches wars.
[00:14:23.983 --> 00:14:31.708]  And I'm sitting there watching this with my mouth hanging open, and we're digging around for the clip, but I saw her say it.
[00:14:32.328 --> 00:14:34.549]  And she goes, this is not about chemical weapons.
[00:14:34.989 --> 00:14:37.251]  This is about a man hurting his people.
[00:14:37.271 --> 00:14:39.212]  This is about freedom.
[00:14:40.132 --> 00:14:45.956]  This is about never allowing something like Rwanda to happen again.
[00:14:47.645 --> 00:15:02.646]  So then I walked back into my office to get my jogging shoes and they had CNN on and I saw the very same talking point but by one of the pundits saying this is about Rwanda
[00:15:03.712 --> 00:15:06.293]  I mean, we didn't do anything in Rwanda.
[00:15:06.733 --> 00:15:08.194]  We've got to do something about Rwanda.
[00:15:08.454 --> 00:15:21.080]  And I walk in about an hour and a half ago, and they're looking at a clip of Christina Amanpour, you know, married to the former State Department head under Clinton, and this total black ops commander who lied about...
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:36.792]  Serbian atrocities who showed starving people trying to get into a UN food station and said that they were in a concentration camp shooting the video from inside the roped off UN facility with the food at a guy who had tuberculosis.
[00:15:36.812 --> 00:15:37.773]  So that's been confirmed.
[00:15:38.373 --> 00:15:39.754]  She's the one that put that out.
[00:15:41.195 --> 00:15:42.036]  She's the one.
[00:15:44.258 --> 00:15:45.419]  She's the one.
[00:15:47.483 --> 00:15:48.644]  Yeah, there's the new headline.
[00:15:48.704 --> 00:15:52.247]  Samantha Power doing nothing on Syria would haunt our conscience.
[00:15:52.287 --> 00:15:55.169]  So, it's going to haunt our conscience on Rwanda.
[00:15:55.229 --> 00:15:57.831]  And then, of course, if you're informed, you know about Rwanda on record.
[00:15:58.212 --> 00:16:10.442]  The UN went in and took one tribal group that was the animist majority and the minority Christian group, of course, because of the Christian virtue and values of working together,
[00:16:11.772 --> 00:16:14.600]  Most people, that's what destroys civilization, people won't work together.
[00:16:14.821 --> 00:16:15.403]  Like nowadays.
[00:16:15.764 --> 00:16:18.010]  Everybody's trying to stab somebody in the back, everybody acts like weasels.
[00:16:18.809 --> 00:16:19.049]  No, no.
[00:16:19.609 --> 00:16:21.990]  The Christians controlled about 10% of the country.
[00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:25.791]  They had most of the wealth, and most of the big farms, and the money, and the industry.
[00:16:25.811 --> 00:16:28.973]  And of course, now since they destroyed them, Rwanda's completely collapsed.
[00:16:29.353 --> 00:16:39.816]  And the animists and the Muslims and others, Muslims were a minority as well, they went out of the UN, they put the Christian minority in facilities, and the UN set up machine guns, and they tried to leave.
[00:16:40.317 --> 00:16:41.977]  And when they would try to leave, they'd machine gun them.
[00:16:42.337 --> 00:16:43.638]  So they sent the
[00:16:44.398 --> 00:16:56.046]  The majority group in, black on black, but they divided them up, to murder around, they debate the numbers, 800,000, one and a half million, let's just say a million people.
[00:16:56.466 --> 00:16:57.947]  And it came out in all the foreign press.
[00:16:58.428 --> 00:17:07.634]  The Belgian and other UN troops murdering, raping the children, machine gunning them, with heavy weapons if they tried to get out, and then sending in
[00:17:09.033 --> 00:17:14.968]  Sending in the majority groups to wipe out the minority group.
[00:17:15.429 --> 00:17:18.376]  Hutus and Tootsies, same people genetically.
[00:17:22.813 --> 00:17:34.656]  Wiped them out because the Christians owned property that had gold and diamonds and all sorts of other things that are needed in electronics, especially rare earth minerals.
[00:17:34.716 --> 00:17:36.077]  They had to be wiped out and they were.
[00:17:36.417 --> 00:17:40.238]  By the way, again, that's what Clinton did there.
[00:17:40.758 --> 00:17:48.080]  And then don't forget sending in the Muslims out of Albania, south of Serbia, and sending in
[00:17:49.464 --> 00:17:58.294]  Uh, the, uh, Croats and other groups, and again, I'm not a Muslim, I'm not a Croat, I'm not a Serb, I'm not taking sides in this, okay?
[00:17:58.734 --> 00:18:00.035]  The point is, facts are facts.
[00:18:00.076 --> 00:18:08.705]  The UN's own report, five years after the Serbia bombardments, admitted that the Croats and the Muslims started it and killed double.
[00:18:09.775 --> 00:18:10.515]  What the Serbs did.
[00:18:10.915 --> 00:18:13.316]  And the Serbs did atrocities as well, but they didn't start it.
[00:18:13.757 --> 00:18:15.097]  This is how the globalists operate.
[00:18:15.117 --> 00:18:16.377]  This is how Brzezinski operates.
[00:18:16.578 --> 00:18:18.318]  This is how the Democrats run their peace wars.
[00:18:18.678 --> 00:18:19.939]  They invade your country.
[00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:26.261]  They'll use any... Oh, you got a big group of black animists?
[00:18:27.021 --> 00:18:28.282]  Those are folks that worship animals.
[00:18:30.683 --> 00:18:35.225]  They outnumber, you know, eight to one, and then with the Muslims involved, nine to one, the Christians?
[00:18:35.565 --> 00:18:36.165]  Wipe them out!
[00:18:39.602 --> 00:18:43.470]  Oh, you don't like the Serbs running their own industry, running their own businesses, running their own operations?
[00:18:44.512 --> 00:18:47.839]  Just send in Al-Qaeda, that's on record.
[00:18:48.019 --> 00:18:50.384]  Cause for Liberation Army was Al-Qaeda, the hobbyist.
[00:18:52.051 --> 00:18:55.215]  Send them in, have them kill everybody, the Serbs fight back, call it an atrocity.
[00:18:55.675 --> 00:18:57.877]  Bomb the entire infrastructure of Serbia.
[00:18:57.897 --> 00:19:03.584]  Blow up their TV stations, their power stations, their water stations, their car factories, their aircraft factories.
[00:19:03.644 --> 00:19:04.324]  Peaceful stuff.
[00:19:04.785 --> 00:19:05.626]  With DU.
[00:19:05.946 --> 00:19:07.368]  Bomb Belgrade.
[00:19:08.249 --> 00:19:09.290]  They bombed Belgrade.
[00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:13.795]  Hundreds of targets with giant DU SABOs.
[00:19:16.698 --> 00:19:18.299]  Blowing them to kingdom come.
[00:19:18.939 --> 00:19:19.320]  Guess what?
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:22.842]  They do have, decades later, a more than triple level.
[00:19:22.882 --> 00:19:23.322]  Look it up.
[00:19:23.863 --> 00:19:25.984]  The number I saw was five times the cancer rate.
[00:19:26.544 --> 00:19:27.585]  And now in Belgrade?
[00:19:28.906 --> 00:19:30.086]  Talk about chemical weapons.
[00:19:30.127 --> 00:19:31.447]  Nerve gas just kills who it hits.
[00:19:31.487 --> 00:19:33.369]  It doesn't kill you a month later.
[00:19:33.389 --> 00:19:34.910]  DU's got a what?
[00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:37.551]  A half-life of four billion years, was it, last time I checked?
[00:19:38.972 --> 00:19:44.856]  Boy, that's a chemical, a chemical radiological weapon that kills biological life.
[00:19:47.068 --> 00:19:52.454]  And now they're pumping the jihadis in and the head of Al-Qaeda is praising it being armed by the U.S.
[00:19:52.875 --> 00:19:56.859]  while he says next he's going to attack America and they're going to let him attack America.
[00:19:56.879 --> 00:19:57.420]  You watch.
[00:19:59.582 --> 00:20:00.964]  And then the government can take our rights.
[00:20:02.125 --> 00:20:03.427]  See how that works so good?
[00:20:04.067 --> 00:20:05.429]  It works perfectly, doesn't it?
[00:20:05.689 --> 00:20:07.551]  Full spectrum dominance.
[00:20:09.255 --> 00:20:11.296]  It's time for a home security quiz.
[00:20:11.657 --> 00:20:24.645]  What effective home security device is smaller than a coffee cup, fakes out burglars into thinking someone is home at your house while you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is recommended by many police departments, and sells for less than $30?
[00:20:25.706 --> 00:20:27.407]  Yes, it's fake TV.
[00:20:27.627 --> 00:20:29.789]  This year, about 1 in every 50 U.S.
[00:20:29.829 --> 00:20:35.933]  homes will have a break-in with burglars usually picking the easy target, a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[00:20:36.253 --> 00:20:44.279]  Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look like someone is home watching TV by simulating the light from a real TV.
[00:20:44.839 --> 00:20:50.324]  Fake TV could be the difference between coming home to a secure house or one that's been ransacked.
[00:20:50.544 --> 00:20:57.490]  To get your fake TV for only $29.95 with free shipping, go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.

[00:21:09.119 --> 00:21:10.340]  Don't throw away leftovers.
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:16.482]  Instead, throw all your leftovers, vegetable peels, eggshells, coffee grounds, pizza crusts, and more into the Bokashi!

[00:22:08.325 --> 00:22:17.571]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it lent back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:22:17.631 --> 00:22:18.371]  This capitalism?
[00:22:18.431 --> 00:22:24.535]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:22:24.595 --> 00:22:28.237]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[00:23:08.266 --> 00:23:10.329]  It's hurricane and wildfire season again.
[00:23:10.349 --> 00:23:17.938]  Why do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year, betting their lives that the disaster won't get them?
[00:23:18.378 --> 00:23:18.959]  Hundreds of you
[00:23:20.282 --> 00:23:23.043]  We have 50,000 donated meals to the Oklahoma victims.
[00:23:23.303 --> 00:23:25.243]  The problem is we can't help everybody.
[00:23:25.483 --> 00:23:31.605]  If every one of us who can will take care of ourselves, we can all pitch in to take care of those who really can't.
[00:23:31.905 --> 00:23:39.706]  The new Just-In-Case Pack from eFoods Direct is the big brother to the 7-Day Emergency Pack designed for Oklahoma disaster donations.

[00:23:53.892 --> 00:23:56.893]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com slash alex.
[00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:38.844]  I really do try to manage my anger.
[00:24:40.825 --> 00:24:45.968]  And it's not like I'm some goody-two-shoes that just likes to get angry and flounce around.
[00:24:47.109 --> 00:24:48.270]  I work on this all the time.
[00:24:48.330 --> 00:24:49.611]  I mean, I know who these people are.
[00:24:50.051 --> 00:24:50.992]  I know what they've done.
[00:24:51.612 --> 00:24:59.157]  Bill Clinton and the UN ran the mass murder of the Christian minority in Rwanda to take their property on record.
[00:25:00.718 --> 00:25:04.601]  Their rare-earth mineral property that Africa's just brimming with like nowhere in the world.
[00:25:06.167 --> 00:25:06.607]  On record.
[00:25:06.727 --> 00:25:07.628]  And then the media spun it.
[00:25:07.788 --> 00:25:09.089]  Oh, they didn't do enough.
[00:25:09.129 --> 00:25:09.509]  The U.N.
[00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:10.050]  didn't do enough.
[00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:11.991]  They ran the operation.
[00:25:12.051 --> 00:25:12.812]  And now it's public.
[00:25:12.852 --> 00:25:17.035]  They run operations in Latin America, Asia, and Africa, killing villagers for their property.
[00:25:17.635 --> 00:25:20.457]  Now they just say, oh, they were, it was forced relocation.
[00:25:20.497 --> 00:25:22.819]  And yeah, they did burn down the village and shoot people.
[00:25:23.299 --> 00:25:24.801]  And it's in the back of the New York Times.
[00:25:24.861 --> 00:25:25.921]  It's a problem.
[00:25:26.902 --> 00:25:31.645]  See, they're even mainlining it now, where, oh, yeah, we just go burn down your village.
[00:25:32.526 --> 00:25:36.069]  And then I went and looked at the films shot by German film crews.
[00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:53.986]  I went and looked at the Danish magazine articles with them roasting kids over fires and raping them and setting up the UN checkpoints and seeing if you were a Christian with your ID and then handing you over to the majority animist pagan group to be killed.
[00:25:56.644 --> 00:25:58.765]  I know there's two million people that have exited.
[00:25:58.785 --> 00:26:00.105]  That's Reuters out of Syria.
[00:26:00.385 --> 00:26:01.225]  Most of them Christians.
[00:26:01.785 --> 00:26:04.826]  I know of the hundreds of thousands killed, a large portion of them are Christians.
[00:26:05.106 --> 00:26:05.726]  Put the sword.
[00:26:05.986 --> 00:26:10.747]  And then I've got to watch Samantha Powers and I've got to watch Christina Amanpour.
[00:26:11.188 --> 00:26:13.988]  These women are all obviously jacked up on hormones.
[00:26:14.328 --> 00:26:18.549]  They're all prancing around, totally jacked up sexually.
[00:26:18.589 --> 00:26:25.351]  You can look at them just like getting into themselves, like I'm at a topless bar and they're on, you know, swinging around a pole or something.
[00:26:25.851 --> 00:26:37.156]  I mean it's really sick when women are like rubbing on their hands and got their nails all done and are sassing back and forth saying it's for the children, we need a big war and they're all trying to be sexy about it and they're not good looking.
[00:26:37.756 --> 00:26:39.037]  It's really disgusting.
[00:26:39.877 --> 00:26:41.478]  It's demonic is what I'm saying.
[00:26:41.498 --> 00:26:46.160]  And I don't, it's just, it's one thing if it's an old hunchbacked evil man doing it, you hate him.
[00:26:47.301 --> 00:26:54.084]  Or even Albright, looks like a goblin, Madeleine Albright, you know saying 500,000 kids was a terrible price but a price we had to pay for Iraq.
[00:26:55.316 --> 00:26:56.778]  We've got that clip, we'll play it in a moment.
[00:26:57.739 --> 00:27:05.529]  And I know they're the authors of destroying Serbia and starting the civil war that killed massive amounts of people on record.
[00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:08.753]  I mean, that's even in the UN's own reports they don't deny that.
[00:27:09.721 --> 00:27:16.363]  That's what's crazy, and they ran the Rwanda thing, and now the talking point from Christina Amanpour, and we've got a clip of her.
[00:27:17.163 --> 00:27:29.046]  And the clip from Powers, and the clip from Clinton's out there, and Hillary going, we've got to do this for the children, when these people are the biggest murderers of children alive today.
[00:27:30.406 --> 00:27:31.346]  I've studied it, folks.
[00:27:32.506 --> 00:27:35.047]  Mousley Tongue's been dead a long time, Pol Pot's been dead.
[00:27:35.067 --> 00:27:38.608]  I really realized, oh my gosh, the Clintons.
[00:27:41.738 --> 00:27:48.584]  The Clintons and the things they oversaw with sanctions on Iraq and the rest of it are the biggest murderers of children in the world.
[00:27:49.185 --> 00:27:57.752]  And I, first I got mad because I saw it on one TV and then I walked and saw it on another channel and I almost started turning desk over.
[00:27:57.812 --> 00:27:58.773]  I'm going to be honest with you.
[00:27:59.895 --> 00:28:13.042]  And then I just said, no, I'm gonna go home to my family, and then I see my innocent children, and I start thinking about these vampire witches killing all these kids, and then they're up there grandstanding like they're good, and I just, it's flipping me out.
[00:28:13.743 --> 00:28:20.626]  And I know it's flipping you out as well, but it's like them saying the North Pole melted when it's the biggest it's ever been recorded, and that's NASA.
[00:28:21.247 --> 00:28:25.569]  I mean, they're on CNN saying the North Pole has basically melted down to nothing.
[00:28:25.589 --> 00:28:26.650]  We've played the news clip.
[00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:28.551]  Wow, it's the biggest ever!
[00:28:30.996 --> 00:28:34.817]  I mean, these people are a larcenous group of enemies!
[00:28:34.837 --> 00:28:35.557]  And it just hit me!
[00:28:35.757 --> 00:28:36.938]  They know they're enemies!
[00:28:37.198 --> 00:28:38.398]  They know they're criminal!
[00:28:38.838 --> 00:28:39.798]  They know they're evil!
[00:28:39.838 --> 00:28:41.399]  They want to kill more children!
[00:28:42.199 --> 00:28:44.319]  They are actual Satan!
[00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:50.101]  I... I just... I just... I just can't... How much more do we have to take?
[00:28:51.886 --> 00:28:53.548]  And then they say, oh, Putin.
[00:28:53.588 --> 00:28:54.729]  Notice how the media is masterful.
[00:28:54.969 --> 00:28:57.151]  Putin's really beaten America.
[00:28:57.491 --> 00:29:00.935]  Putin's really, you know, Putin has beaten the globalist vampires.
[00:29:01.595 --> 00:29:06.760]  He's just a worldly mob boss, you know, who's into, you know, being a champion fighter and stuff.
[00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:08.001]  But at least he's a man.
[00:29:08.021 --> 00:29:09.182]  At least he's not a puppet.
[00:29:09.483 --> 00:29:12.505]  Even though he's undoubtedly powerful and pretty wicked.
[00:29:13.286 --> 00:29:15.627]  You can see there's a strain of good in him and he's not a puppet.
[00:29:16.108 --> 00:29:24.052]  The people we have are literal Nosferatu demons directly out of some other dimension, I'm starting to think.
[00:29:24.912 --> 00:29:31.556]  And I mean that hypothetically as hyperbole, but the point is they might as well be, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:31.576 --> 00:29:32.757]  We come back, I'm going to play all these clips.
[00:29:32.777 --> 00:29:35.878]  I'm going to play Albright saying 500,000 kids is a good price to pay.
[00:29:36.599 --> 00:29:40.581]  And then I'm going to put a thing on the nightly news tonight juxtaposing
[00:29:42.188 --> 00:29:55.372]  Juxtaposing all these clips of them admittingly killing people with them saying they care about the kids in Syria, when if they end up taking over Syria, they'll be 50 times the death.
[00:29:55.532 --> 00:29:56.732]  They'll probably kill everybody.
[00:29:57.172 --> 00:29:58.073]  I mean, it's incredible.
[00:29:58.553 --> 00:29:59.453]  We're on the march.
[00:29:59.953 --> 00:30:01.554]  The empire's on the run.

[00:30:57.768 --> 00:30:59.810]  And sodium hexafluorosilicate.

[00:33:17.874 --> 00:33:24.219]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:44.133 --> 00:33:46.995]  Oh, have you heard the latest news, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:33:48.276 --> 00:34:03.127]  The Senate panel okays measure defining a journalist, and Dianne Feinstein has come out and said that it's only people making large salaries every year working for an established, old, dead media system.
[00:34:03.527 --> 00:34:04.548]  Any real media?
[00:34:04.668 --> 00:34:05.549]  Any new media?
[00:34:06.249 --> 00:34:09.651]  Any real journalism resurrected because they're not real media.
[00:34:09.831 --> 00:34:13.952]  They're Pentagon regurgitators putting out state-run propaganda on record.
[00:34:14.373 --> 00:34:18.915]  They've just finally gotten rid of the pretenses because it's known a month ago.
[00:34:19.535 --> 00:34:20.695]  They got rid of the law.
[00:34:21.016 --> 00:34:22.916]  They were already violating whole hog.
[00:34:24.417 --> 00:34:28.859]  And now they're war on real journalists to try to buy them off with covert Pentagon money.
[00:34:28.999 --> 00:34:30.600]  That was declassified a month ago.
[00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:32.881]  That's how big a deal this is.
[00:34:33.766 --> 00:34:35.847]  They're like, wait, I like the Pentagon, that's our boys.
[00:34:36.587 --> 00:34:42.689]  No, ladies and gentlemen, the globalists that run our Pentagon and run the psych war systems.
[00:34:44.410 --> 00:34:49.612]  And this is how they spin it in the Los Angeles Times, the dinosaur media.
[00:34:50.672 --> 00:34:53.113]  Build to protect journalists, clear Senate panel.
[00:34:54.670 --> 00:35:03.073]  The Senate Judiciary Committee approves a media shield bill to keep real reporters from having to testify on their work.
[00:35:03.673 --> 00:35:04.893]  They call it the Patriot Act.
[00:35:04.933 --> 00:35:07.794]  They call Homeland Security Homeland Security when it's the opposite.
[00:35:08.854 --> 00:35:11.815]  Oh, it's a bill to protect you.
[00:35:11.895 --> 00:35:13.236]  Oh, it's immigration reform.
[00:35:13.456 --> 00:35:16.617]  It legalizes all the illegals, including felons, and lets them vote.
[00:35:18.533 --> 00:35:20.494]  See, they always mislabel something.
[00:35:20.514 --> 00:35:29.576]  It's kind of like the old Tom and Jerry cartoons, when the cat would open his mouth up and have a sign saying it was a nightclub or restaurant, trying to lure the mouse in.
[00:35:29.596 --> 00:35:32.477]  I mean, oh, I'm going to give you free health care.
[00:35:32.897 --> 00:35:39.199]  I'm not going to raise your payroll tax, not your income tax, none of your taxes, if you make less than $250,000 a year.
[00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:41.340]  Oh, you're making even less than $30,000?
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:42.260]  I'm going to raise it.
[00:35:44.101 --> 00:35:44.981]  And then you read it.
[00:35:46.109 --> 00:35:47.590]  See, this is what real journalists do.
[00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:52.114]  They actually go to what the bill does, not what the name is.
[00:35:52.174 --> 00:35:54.936]  That's what Matt Drudge tweeted yesterday.
[00:35:54.996 --> 00:35:55.696]  He tweeted that...
[00:35:58.021 --> 00:36:04.907]  On his personal tweet, on his news feed tweet, Matt Drudge blasts Ian Feinstein for trying to define who is and who isn't a reporter.
[00:36:04.927 --> 00:36:07.970]  We'll see, that's exactly what Karl Rove said, he told the New York Times.
[00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:09.651]  I define reality now.
[00:36:10.272 --> 00:36:14.156]  Comments from Senator Feinstein yesterday on who's reporter were disgusting.
[00:36:14.176 --> 00:36:18.419]  17-year-old blogger is as important as Wolf Blitzer.
[00:36:19.921 --> 00:36:21.963]  Absolutely, if a 17-year-old blogger
[00:36:23.163 --> 00:36:30.047]  Is out blogging on NASCAR, or let's say on some other circuit.
[00:36:31.968 --> 00:36:33.869]  Le Mans series or something.
[00:36:35.250 --> 00:36:37.751]  One of my favorites, because there's a whole bunch of different cars at once out there.
[00:36:37.831 --> 00:36:39.032]  By the time, that's what I would be doing.
[00:36:41.693 --> 00:36:44.014]  And you look at that.
[00:36:48.017 --> 00:36:50.198]  And you see a wreck or something happen.
[00:36:51.567 --> 00:36:57.272]  And then you videotape it, or you write about it, and you end up being all over the news, and your perspective, you're a journalist!
[00:36:58.472 --> 00:36:59.874]  You're eyes and ears out there.
[00:37:00.394 --> 00:37:05.998]  You're not bought and paid for like the state-run media that gets taxpayer money, like NPR and MSNBC.
[00:37:06.919 --> 00:37:09.501]  Thank God for all the real bloggers and people.
[00:37:09.521 --> 00:37:10.582]  We love having them on.
[00:37:10.822 --> 00:37:15.246]  That's how we're able to, anything that happens now, we've got listeners that are out there as citizen journalists.
[00:37:15.996 --> 00:37:21.019]  Or people we can contact that are out there from their own blogs or on YouTube channels to come on and tell us what they saw.
[00:37:21.299 --> 00:37:23.340]  And it's bringing back real journalism.
[00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:25.201]  And the system is upset about that.
[00:37:25.381 --> 00:37:35.826]  The Pentagon said a month and a half ago they're freaked out by Drudge and what he represents in the new media and that no one believes them anymore and that the people have lost confidence.
[00:37:36.067 --> 00:37:40.229]  So their answer is a major offensive against the new real media.
[00:37:42.199 --> 00:37:46.040]  To come in and make contact and to do business deals with.
[00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:51.981]  They're now going to have the Pentagon that's in the business of fake news in foreign countries and buying off news reporters.
[00:37:52.421 --> 00:37:54.321]  They're now going to be hitting everybody.
[00:37:54.341 --> 00:37:56.682]  And by the way, folks, now there's the headline.
[00:37:56.902 --> 00:37:59.622]  Pentagon says they've lost control of independent media led by Drudge.
[00:38:01.543 --> 00:38:03.103]  Then there's my analysis of it up there.
[00:38:03.843 --> 00:38:07.984]  And I told you they're collapsing when they're all in an emergency meeting on the Pentagon channel.
[00:38:08.854 --> 00:38:17.521]  With hundreds of top brass and top flack in there, top PR flacks, looking totally freaked out going, our metrics show no one believes us anymore.
[00:38:18.062 --> 00:38:18.782]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:38:19.163 --> 00:38:20.123]  And we're in deep trouble.
[00:38:20.183 --> 00:38:21.745]  We've got to be truthful and stop lying.
[00:38:21.765 --> 00:38:23.606]  And they go, what do you mean, sir?
[00:38:23.646 --> 00:38:24.267]  Stop lying.
[00:38:24.307 --> 00:38:24.987]  That's our job.
[00:38:25.308 --> 00:38:26.188]  Well, you know what I mean.
[00:38:26.228 --> 00:38:27.990]  Don't just bald-faced deny things.
[00:38:28.290 --> 00:38:29.191]  Put spin on it.
[00:38:31.206 --> 00:38:34.687]  And they're all looking freaked out going, but they still aren't going to believe that.
[00:38:35.067 --> 00:38:35.527]  Doesn't matter.
[00:38:35.547 --> 00:38:37.548]  We're going to make contact with all the bloggers.
[00:38:37.708 --> 00:38:38.548]  We're going to bring them in.
[00:38:38.768 --> 00:38:39.888]  We're going to embed them with us.
[00:38:40.108 --> 00:38:41.689]  Because now we're going to be operating domestically.
[00:38:41.989 --> 00:38:43.629]  So it's all a PSYOP on them.
[00:38:44.469 --> 00:38:49.311]  They're being more PSYOP than anybody in that hour-long Pentagon briefing you ought to go watch and question and answer.
[00:38:49.331 --> 00:38:55.052]  And everybody's rolling their eyes and looking freaked out because they're announcing a major PSYOP attack on America.
[00:38:55.072 --> 00:38:55.132]  And
[00:38:59.011 --> 00:39:02.473]  Everybody there knows how illegal and criminal and un-American this is.
[00:39:02.493 --> 00:39:05.956]  And they already know it's been going on forever anyways.
[00:39:06.356 --> 00:39:11.099]  And so you can see them having their morale destroyed even more right in front of you.
[00:39:11.399 --> 00:39:18.964]  And the Undersecretary of Defense looks completely freaked out while he's doing it.
[00:39:21.126 --> 00:39:23.768]  I mean, they're finally been arrogant and hubris-filled.
[00:39:24.028 --> 00:39:26.950]  They're now in Titanic-level panic mode.
[00:39:29.301 --> 00:39:53.189]  They are now having a complete meltdown, and Dianne Feinstein, the witch, is coming out saying, we now will define, and they're now going to try to get it passed in the full Senate and the House, saying everybody else who isn't listed by the federal government as real media, meaning state-run, state-controlled, on a short leash,
[00:39:54.554 --> 00:39:57.635]  So they can call and threaten, you know, the bosses.
[00:39:57.655 --> 00:39:58.896]  There's many famous cases.
[00:39:59.276 --> 00:40:01.317]  Photography is not a crime out of Florida.
[00:40:02.017 --> 00:40:03.498]  He has the famous case a few years ago.
[00:40:03.518 --> 00:40:04.958]  In fact, I want to get that guy on this show.
[00:40:05.198 --> 00:40:06.079]  He's been on the nightly news.
[00:40:07.599 --> 00:40:11.781]  He was a famous, you know, blogger, video guy, national news every week.
[00:40:12.061 --> 00:40:15.222]  He shows up to cover a police event.
[00:40:16.443 --> 00:40:19.644]  And there's all these television cameras and news there on a public sidewalk.
[00:40:19.664 --> 00:40:21.665]  They walk over and they go, you're not allowed to be here.
[00:40:22.654 --> 00:40:25.056]  They are their real media, and they arrested him.
[00:40:25.336 --> 00:40:26.377]  Of course, now it's in court.
[00:40:27.257 --> 00:40:28.278]  But that's the idea.
[00:40:28.298 --> 00:40:34.442]  They want to be able to say, you do not have any protection, and we're going to arrest you for having a camera.
[00:40:34.462 --> 00:40:35.223]  And it gets worse than that.
[00:40:35.483 --> 00:40:39.345]  What the feds are saying is, you will have no source anonymity.
[00:40:41.527 --> 00:40:47.291]  Under the definition, Matt Drudge, with, I don't know, what is it, 50 million visitors a day, something like that?
[00:40:49.838 --> 00:40:51.239]  We get millions of visitors a day now?
[00:40:51.539 --> 00:40:54.221]  He gets 30, 40, 50 million last time I checked.
[00:40:54.742 --> 00:40:55.563]  It's in the 50s, yeah.
[00:40:56.403 --> 00:41:01.127]  You're not a journalist, even though you've broken hundreds of national news stories.
[00:41:01.667 --> 00:41:03.369]  Everybody in the world begs to be on your site.
[00:41:03.849 --> 00:41:13.877]  You're not Dianne Feinstein, a big ugly witch who wants to disarm everybody, an authoritarian bag of scrofulous beetle droppings.
[00:41:14.437 --> 00:41:15.879]  She is going to
[00:41:17.312 --> 00:41:22.918]  This anti-free speech tyrant, she is going to decide who is and who isn't.
[00:41:23.138 --> 00:41:24.380]  And that's the whole magic wand.
[00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:25.761]  They decide what reality is.
[00:41:25.801 --> 00:41:26.522]  They tell us, well guess what?
[00:41:26.742 --> 00:41:27.283]  It's too late.
[00:41:27.463 --> 00:41:28.764]  Go ahead and try to shut the blogs down.
[00:41:28.965 --> 00:41:31.387]  Go ahead and try to arrest reporters all over the country for videotaping.
[00:41:31.588 --> 00:41:32.789]  Go ahead and arrest my reporters.
[00:41:32.949 --> 00:41:33.810]  We'll sue you and win.
[00:41:33.850 --> 00:41:35.191]  We have G20.
[00:41:35.612 --> 00:41:36.072]  Pittsburgh.
[00:41:36.713 --> 00:41:37.253]  Go ahead!
[00:41:37.333 --> 00:41:38.113]  You want to fight?
[00:41:38.393 --> 00:41:40.934]  You tyrant, scum Americans!
[00:41:41.034 --> 00:41:43.094]  Real Americans have done it before and will do it again.
[00:41:43.295 --> 00:41:52.257]  And we're sick of the world blaming Americans and Americana for what you globalist scumbags that are the antithesis of what made this country so great.
[00:41:52.637 --> 00:41:53.917]  That's what Putin said at the end of his letter.
[00:41:54.137 --> 00:41:56.118]  He said, all men are created equal.
[00:41:57.018 --> 00:41:58.318]  America has been great.
[00:41:59.338 --> 00:42:02.219]  But now you're becoming very, very corrupt and dangerous.
[00:42:03.328 --> 00:42:11.254]  And the world doesn't like what you're doing, and your own people don't like what you're doing, and you're not exceptional to be above the law to commit war crimes and fund Al Qaeda.
[00:42:11.915 --> 00:42:15.758]  And all of these, and Senator Mendez with all his scandals has the nerve.
[00:42:16.899 --> 00:42:18.100]  You know about his scandals, folks?
[00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:20.282]  I'm not going to get into them on air, they're so amazing.
[00:42:21.229 --> 00:42:24.832]  That blob just looks like a... I would not want to hang out with him.
[00:42:25.172 --> 00:42:26.513]  I wouldn't want to have dinner with him.
[00:42:26.854 --> 00:42:28.135]  I wouldn't want him as my neighbor.
[00:42:28.435 --> 00:42:30.276]  I wouldn't want John McCain as my neighbor.
[00:42:30.296 --> 00:42:31.257]  These are creeps!
[00:42:31.737 --> 00:42:33.159]  Creepy weirdos!
[00:42:33.779 --> 00:42:40.104]  Creepy scumbags with a trail of evil, Keating 5, bid rigging, stock market fixing.
[00:42:40.144 --> 00:42:42.066]  Just... I mean, just look at these people!
[00:42:43.643 --> 00:42:46.544]  You know, they go to the Senate worth a million bucks, they're worth $300,000, $400,000.
[00:42:46.744 --> 00:42:50.006]  You go to the House worth $50,000, they're worth $20,000,000 in five years.
[00:42:50.066 --> 00:42:51.547]  I mean, they are just robbing us.
[00:42:52.247 --> 00:42:52.907]  Wholesale.
[00:42:54.968 --> 00:42:56.509]  And now Harry Reid's really freaking out.
[00:42:56.769 --> 00:42:58.390]  He's not up there like he said yesterday.
[00:42:58.430 --> 00:43:02.112]  In fact, if you guys don't have this... No, no, we do have it.
[00:43:02.652 --> 00:43:06.694]  He called them, the Tea Partiers are non-violent anarchists who don't believe in any form of government.
[00:43:06.874 --> 00:43:07.994]  We have the biggest government in the world.
[00:43:08.375 --> 00:43:09.155]  We're already bankrupt.
[00:43:09.195 --> 00:43:11.076]  It's growing exponentially, minute by minute.
[00:43:12.439 --> 00:43:28.002]  And they have the nerve to get up there and say that the Tea Party is running the country, which is true, and that we're Neanderthal, barbarian, scum, racist, obstructionist.
[00:43:28.562 --> 00:43:29.542]  That's the real Tea Party.
[00:43:29.562 --> 00:43:31.143]  Remember they said the Tea Party has no power?
[00:43:31.403 --> 00:43:32.303]  The Tea Party's a joke.
[00:43:32.323 --> 00:43:35.764]  The Republican bluebloods tried to co-opt it, didn't successfully do it.
[00:43:36.024 --> 00:43:38.384]  Karl Rove spends all his time trying to steer it or kill it.
[00:43:41.145 --> 00:43:41.845]  It's disgusting.
[00:43:44.229 --> 00:43:48.991]  And now Harry Reid has come out and said they're dangerous anarchists, and others have said they're barbarians, they're racist.
[00:43:49.411 --> 00:43:52.173]  But he says in there that we're running the agenda.
[00:43:52.453 --> 00:43:59.576]  The Ron Paul, Alex Jones, Drudge Report, Info Wars type libertarianism.
[00:43:59.596 --> 00:44:03.378]  That's why Beck suddenly has jumped fully into libertarian camp, anti-New World Order.
[00:44:03.858 --> 00:44:04.938]  Sounds like Alex Jones Show.
[00:44:04.978 --> 00:44:05.859]  Hallelujah, we've won.
[00:44:06.707 --> 00:44:07.428]  Rush Limbaugh.
[00:44:07.448 --> 00:44:08.448]  Looks like a false flag.
[00:44:08.649 --> 00:44:10.150]  You see, we're taking over, folks!
[00:44:10.810 --> 00:44:11.871]  That's Americana!
[00:44:12.191 --> 00:44:14.473]  Don't let the globalists speak for you.
[00:44:14.993 --> 00:44:18.616]  See, notice they're saying, Putin has defeated America.
[00:44:18.676 --> 00:44:20.037]  Putin has made America look bad.
[00:44:20.137 --> 00:44:21.318]  Putin has outmaneuvered America.
[00:44:21.478 --> 00:44:25.101]  They go, well, I don't like Obama, but I don't like Putin outmaneuvering America.
[00:44:25.381 --> 00:44:26.862]  Putin didn't outmaneuver America.
[00:44:27.182 --> 00:44:29.384]  He called that the emperor was wearing no clothes.
[00:44:30.025 --> 00:44:31.406]  He called shenanigans.
[00:44:31.786 --> 00:44:32.587]  He called fraud.
[00:44:32.627 --> 00:44:33.047]  And guess what?
[00:44:33.307 --> 00:44:33.988]  It isn't Putin.
[00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:39.133]  Stealing four or five trillion dollars of taxpayer money a year to give to foreign offshore megabanks.
[00:44:39.733 --> 00:44:43.976]  Putin kicked the oligarchs out of his country and arrested those he couldn't kick out.
[00:44:45.798 --> 00:44:48.119]  Oh, you work for the Rothschilds or Rockefellers?
[00:44:48.139 --> 00:44:49.480]  You own half the Russia?
[00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:52.162]  Oh, you did it through fraud back in the 1920s?
[00:44:52.402 --> 00:44:54.784]  How about we clap handcuffs on you?
[00:44:56.765 --> 00:44:57.866]  Same thing Iceland's doing.
[00:44:59.423 --> 00:45:00.864]  Again, I'm not moving to Iceland.
[00:45:01.284 --> 00:45:02.385]  I'm a fan of what they've done.
[00:45:02.405 --> 00:45:04.046]  I'm a fan of what the Russians have been doing.
[00:45:04.587 --> 00:45:06.668]  My goodness, we have globalists.
[00:45:06.848 --> 00:45:12.612]  The headlines should be, Putin stands up against America's occupiers.
[00:45:12.933 --> 00:45:16.075]  Putin stands up against banking cartel that's hijacked America.
[00:45:17.336 --> 00:45:20.278]  We ought to be allied with Russia under free market and liberty.
[00:45:20.438 --> 00:45:21.959]  They ought to be our biggest trading partner.
[00:45:24.522 --> 00:45:26.623]  Russia's relaxing their gun laws.
[00:45:26.943 --> 00:45:28.484]  Russia's paying people to have kids.
[00:45:28.844 --> 00:45:30.505]  Russia's trying to have family values.
[00:45:30.725 --> 00:45:33.727]  We're doing the opposite, because Russia's already been through hell.
[00:45:34.027 --> 00:45:35.768]  They've already been through the tyranny.
[00:45:35.788 --> 00:45:42.251]  You know, they say that's always the greatest areas of liberty are places that have been under the tyranny the longest.
[00:45:43.672 --> 00:45:46.353]  A smart man, you know, said that
[00:45:47.935 --> 00:45:54.323]  Cuba and China and places like that that have been under hellish tyranny, they're going to be the sanctums of liberty.
[00:45:54.824 --> 00:45:56.206]  Because that's how the cycle works.
[00:45:57.888 --> 00:45:58.108]  We...
[00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:10.015]  We are a big, giant, rotting, evil empire and we need to disavow it and say it's not us, it's not America, we don't want it on us, we rebuke it, we refuse it.
[00:46:10.055 --> 00:46:12.416]  You eat some bad food, you start feeling sick.
[00:46:13.097 --> 00:46:16.058]  I've gotten food poisoning with friends before, back in college at a restaurant.
[00:46:16.459 --> 00:46:20.501]  I felt sick, it tasted weird after like five bites, I felt weird, it tasted metal-y.
[00:46:23.622 --> 00:46:26.284]  I went, threw up, didn't get sick, they all got food poisoning.
[00:46:27.827 --> 00:46:30.869]  One of my friends had to go to the hospital over it at a Mexican food restaurant.
[00:46:32.689 --> 00:46:36.231]  Because the bacteria release toxins of those type that can give you the food poisoning.
[00:46:36.251 --> 00:46:37.712]  I was like, this doesn't taste right.
[00:46:38.572 --> 00:46:39.413]  Tastes bleh.
[00:46:40.593 --> 00:46:41.954]  I had like a psychosomatic response.
[00:46:44.175 --> 00:46:47.177]  I think I pulled over driving home and threw up on the side of the road.
[00:46:47.197 --> 00:46:47.857]  I don't remember the whole story.
[00:46:47.877 --> 00:46:50.278]  The point is, everybody else was deathly ill the next day.
[00:46:51.139 --> 00:46:51.919]  My college buddies.
[00:46:52.820 --> 00:46:53.320]  Deathly ill.
[00:46:54.443 --> 00:47:10.698]  And we need to vomit out Dianne Feinstein and Kerry and Obama and Karl Rove and the Bushes and all the kleptocrats and just, come on, we need to have dry heaves and just vomit and vomit and vomit until bile starts coming out.
[00:47:11.279 --> 00:47:20.187]  And then vomit some more and then vomit some more and then vomit and vomit and vomit and vomit and go through a fever and get this disease out of us, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47:22.489 --> 00:47:23.290]  That's what we need to do.
[00:47:23.330 --> 00:47:28.274]  We need to rebuke it and we need to put ourselves before God and repent immediately.
[00:47:28.474 --> 00:47:28.874]  All of us.
[00:47:29.114 --> 00:47:35.420]  Because we're going into darkness and God's giving us a chance as the whole world wakes up and we see the evil revealed to say no to it.
[00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:36.881]  To recognize it and say no.
[00:47:36.961 --> 00:47:38.342]  If not, we go over the edge of the cliff.
[00:47:38.582 --> 00:47:39.283]  They take over.
[00:47:39.363 --> 00:47:39.963]  Red Terror.
[00:47:40.284 --> 00:47:40.984]  Secret arrest.
[00:47:41.044 --> 00:47:41.685]  FEMA camps.
[00:47:42.786 --> 00:47:44.767]  America's getting a chance here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47:45.628 --> 00:47:46.449]  Just like when
[00:47:48.325 --> 00:47:53.347]  Jonah, you know, got to Nineveh and went around for ten days warning people, and you know what?
[00:47:53.367 --> 00:47:53.908]  They listened.
[00:47:54.928 --> 00:47:55.608]  They listened!
[00:47:55.628 --> 00:48:02.492]  And they were given a hundred year reprieve before they became a decadent again and were destroyed.
[00:48:02.892 --> 00:48:04.813]  Just like Jerusalem in 70 A.D.
[00:48:06.493 --> 00:48:10.895]  Christ said, before this generation has passed, not one of these stones will be left unturned.
[00:48:11.316 --> 00:48:14.197]  This whole place will be destroyed, he told the head Pharisee.
[00:48:17.264 --> 00:48:19.166]  And the arrogant Pharisee laughed at him.
[00:48:21.768 --> 00:48:27.232]  And in 70 A.D., Titus sacked and burned Jerusalem to the ground.
[00:48:27.893 --> 00:48:30.855]  And I'm telling you, ladies and gentlemen, we're done.
[00:48:31.596 --> 00:48:37.601]  We're done if we don't really realize we've been poisoned and get our stomachs pumped right now.
[00:48:39.443 --> 00:48:41.444]  Oh, Putin's putting down America.
[00:48:41.745 --> 00:48:43.366]  Putin's not saying you're exceptional.
[00:48:43.606 --> 00:48:45.148]  He says you've been exceptional
[00:48:46.161 --> 00:48:51.746]  We want to be friends with you, but you're being exceptionally evil right now, and you don't have a right to be above the law.
[00:48:52.086 --> 00:48:52.947]  Stop it right now.
[00:48:53.808 --> 00:48:57.351]  Folks, the West started the war on record against Syria.
[00:48:57.451 --> 00:48:58.311]  It's a war crime.
[00:48:58.532 --> 00:49:11.062]  And to watch the war criminals that are behind it all, grandstanding and prancing around, and Christina Amanpour doing horrible acting of how emotional she is, and we shouldn't have let Rwanda happen like that, and cement the powers.
[00:49:11.903 --> 00:49:17.344]  These are big, wicked, witch, queen bees, ladies and gentlemen, who are all about their power.
[00:49:17.565 --> 00:49:20.405]  I thought when the women ran the world, there wasn't going to be any war.
[00:49:20.685 --> 00:49:24.246]  It's three women running the whole show for this war, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:49:25.066 --> 00:49:30.248]  You look at Kerry, he can barely stand up, it's so evil, and he's shaking during the testimonies, and that's almost put his head down.
[00:49:30.268 --> 00:49:32.568]  I mean, the demonic load is so heavy.
[00:49:32.789 --> 00:49:38.270]  And you look at these women, they are just absolutely aroused by what they're doing.
[00:49:41.184 --> 00:49:44.767]  I mean, I look at these women, and they're animated by narcissistic sexual energy.
[00:49:45.027 --> 00:49:46.549]  And it makes me want to throw up.
[00:49:46.869 --> 00:49:49.251]  Mendez, you want to throw up reading Putin's letter?
[00:49:49.271 --> 00:49:51.773]  I think it's a beautiful, heartfelt, reaching out letter.
[00:49:52.293 --> 00:49:54.035]  Whether it's cynically done, doesn't matter.
[00:49:54.095 --> 00:49:55.596]  The words are very strong and true.
[00:49:56.117 --> 00:49:58.679]  You, on the other hand, are a coven.
[00:49:59.219 --> 00:50:01.480]  Of black magic witches, I call you out.
[00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:09.942]  Let's go to a real, a real murderer, Madeleine Albright, who helped intensify the sanctions on an industrialized country at that time to kill a half million kids.
[00:50:10.222 --> 00:50:12.463]  Some numbers are a million dead kids now.
[00:50:12.943 --> 00:50:14.043]  This was said a decade ago.
[00:50:14.083 --> 00:50:14.443]  Here it is.
[00:50:14.904 --> 00:50:17.844]  We have heard that a half a million children have died.
[00:50:18.205 --> 00:50:22.526]  I mean, that's more children than died in Hiroshima.
[00:50:23.346 --> 00:50:26.567]  And, you know, is the price worth it?
[00:50:27.631 --> 00:50:32.313]  I think this is a very hard choice, but the price, we think the price is worth it.
[00:50:33.473 --> 00:50:34.754]  And by the way, that's the short clip.
[00:50:34.774 --> 00:50:43.958]  If you find the long clip from 60 Minutes, as she also said on NBC, not just CBS, she goes on to say, for security in the Gulf region, and that we should keep the sanctions on.
[00:50:44.818 --> 00:50:45.598]  Try to find the full clip.
[00:50:45.618 --> 00:50:49.860]  I want to play the full, the full bouquet, the full palette of evil.
[00:50:51.411 --> 00:50:56.717]  Because ladies and gentlemen, then I watched Christina Amanpour, and you look at Albright with the power trip in her eyes.
[00:50:57.237 --> 00:50:59.320]  I've seen these people, when they talk about this stuff, they get animated.
[00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:05.046]  They know what they're doing, they like it, and they know every Christian in Syria is gonna have their head chopped off.
[00:51:05.466 --> 00:51:06.247]  Bye, Al Qaeda.
[00:51:07.168 --> 00:51:07.608]  They love it.
[00:51:08.008 --> 00:51:08.549]  They love it.

[00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:15.842]  Folks, we got Katy Perry's dad.
[00:54:37.017 --> 00:54:38.438]  Who is a huge listener.
[00:54:38.458 --> 00:54:44.104]  Dave Mustaine a couple years ago told me that Katy Perry's dad, one of the biggest pop stars out there, was a huge listener.
[00:54:44.124 --> 00:54:46.646]  So I thought, why not reach out to him a few weeks ago?
[00:54:46.686 --> 00:54:48.448]  And sure enough, he says he listens every day.
[00:54:48.468 --> 00:54:53.573]  We're not going to get him on to talk about Katy Perry, but he has a new book out dealing with what's happened to the youth.
[00:54:55.007 --> 00:54:59.349]  And, um, you know, how this culture has basically gotten to this point.
[00:54:59.729 --> 00:55:05.171]  He has been critical of some of the things his daughter's done, but has been misquoted when he talks about some of the quotes.
[00:55:05.191 --> 00:55:07.832]  So we'll probably briefly clear that up, but I'm not going to get into that.
[00:55:07.852 --> 00:55:09.292]  I want to get into it from his perspective.
[00:55:09.772 --> 00:55:10.652]  She wanted to get into music.
[00:55:10.693 --> 00:55:15.494]  He tried to get her into Christian music and things, but obviously she was talented and got picked up by the New World Order.
[00:55:16.074 --> 00:55:20.296]  But, you know, she does like those Pentagon videos that have hundreds of millions of videos getting girls to sign up for the military.
[00:55:21.181 --> 00:55:22.383]  I don't think she knows what she's doing.
[00:55:22.743 --> 00:55:24.786]  But that's not why Katy Perry's dad's going to be joining us.
[00:55:24.826 --> 00:55:25.867]  I really want to get his perspective.
[00:55:26.227 --> 00:55:30.252]  He's a very interesting preacher and motivational speaker and author.
[00:55:30.653 --> 00:55:31.253]  So he's coming on.
[00:55:31.294 --> 00:55:32.775]  Ray McGovern's going to be coming on as well.
[00:55:33.136 --> 00:55:36.540]  You know, again, I get on air and I try to not get mad.
[00:55:37.181 --> 00:55:39.243]  And when I say these women look sexually excited,
[00:55:40.250 --> 00:55:42.251]  What I mean is like, you know, Miss America.
[00:55:42.291 --> 00:55:44.091]  You know, how they'll jazz up, look excited.
[00:55:45.412 --> 00:55:51.034]  You know, how you'll see women on the street corner trying to look exciting or whatever to get picked up.
[00:55:51.074 --> 00:55:52.054]  It's that same energy.
[00:55:53.274 --> 00:55:54.335]  They just look excited.
[00:55:54.355 --> 00:55:55.955]  They look like they're enjoying it.
[00:55:56.015 --> 00:55:56.796]  It's fun.
[00:55:56.976 --> 00:55:58.596]  You know, they're shaking their hair around.
[00:55:58.836 --> 00:55:59.937]  We're not worried about Putin.
[00:56:00.317 --> 00:56:01.637]  We're going to deal with it.
[00:56:01.677 --> 00:56:02.598]  It's for the children.
[00:56:02.618 --> 00:56:04.658]  And they just are getting off on the power.
[00:56:04.678 --> 00:56:06.779]  It's the narcissism is what I'm talking about.
[00:56:08.186 --> 00:56:12.769]  You know, the sexy woman, I'm in charge, I'll show you.
[00:56:12.810 --> 00:56:15.412]  Obama's got a peace prize.
[00:56:15.712 --> 00:56:16.552]  That's what I'm saying.
[00:56:17.413 --> 00:56:19.395]  Kind of like Mika Brzezinski.
[00:56:22.117 --> 00:56:27.020]  Whenever I had Russell Brand on, he agreed that the women were getting excited on the show.
[00:56:27.341 --> 00:56:28.341]  And no one else pointed that out.
[00:56:28.441 --> 00:56:29.262]  I was pointing that out.
[00:56:29.722 --> 00:56:32.304]  That it's just like they're up there excited to be on TV.
[00:56:32.585 --> 00:56:36.868]  And I get being excited because you're on television, but how is it like a power trip is what I'm saying.
[00:56:37.423 --> 00:56:43.769]  And it's like, with women particularly, I've noticed, that have joined the dark side, it's like they're, it's like a sexual evil.
[00:56:43.789 --> 00:56:44.750]  I don't even know how to describe it.
[00:56:44.770 --> 00:56:46.812]  It's like it's the same vibe they put out.
[00:56:47.413 --> 00:56:50.496]  As they're doing evil things, they're getting off on it.
[00:56:50.536 --> 00:56:51.757]  It's like some wicked thrill.
[00:56:52.611 --> 00:56:53.772]  I'm psychoanalyzing it.
[00:56:53.792 --> 00:56:55.855]  And, you know, that's from my perspective.
[00:56:56.455 --> 00:57:03.102]  You know, no one knew what Only God Forgives meant, and I got the director on and he basically said, yeah, no one's gotten it, that's what the movie means.
[00:57:03.863 --> 00:57:04.604]  And he's blown away.
[00:57:04.644 --> 00:57:09.970]  I'm not tooting my horn, I just recognize things that other people don't seem to recognize for whatever reason.
[00:57:10.631 --> 00:57:12.092]  And it makes me very sick.
[00:57:13.053 --> 00:57:14.174]  Uh, when we see things like this.
[00:57:14.214 --> 00:57:22.823]  Now, now, I'm not going to play the whole exchange, but here is Christina Amanpour, who helped sell the attack on the Serbs that was all a fraud, to put the Muslim extremists in to take them down.
[00:57:23.724 --> 00:57:25.786]  Uh, let's, let's go to a short clip of her going out to break.
[00:57:25.806 --> 00:57:28.689]  I can barely contain myself at this point.
[00:57:31.678 --> 00:57:36.300]  How many more times do we have to say that weapons of mass destruction were used?
[00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:40.941]  And as bad as it is to decapitate somebody, it is by no means equal.
[00:57:40.981 --> 00:57:44.262]  We can't use this false moral equivalence about what's going on right now.
[00:57:44.562 --> 00:57:50.184]  They tried to do it in the Second World War, they tried to do it in Bosnia, they tried to do it in Rwanda, and they're trying to do it now.
[00:57:50.464 --> 00:57:52.545]  There is no moral influence.
[00:57:52.585 --> 00:57:57.327]  Wait just a second!
[00:57:57.447 --> 00:58:01.529]  She's the woman behind a lot of it, and then she's saying other people did it.
[00:58:01.569 --> 00:58:13.535]  And the most moral country in the world, based on the most moral principles in the world, at least that's the fundamental principle that the United States rests on, cannot allow this to go unchecked.
[00:58:13.875 --> 00:58:15.295]  Cannot allow this to go unchecked.
[00:58:15.596 --> 00:58:16.356]  And I'll tell you what.
[00:58:18.186 --> 00:58:23.888]  President Clinton, 15, 16 years later, is still apologizing for Rwanda.
[00:58:25.069 --> 00:58:28.690]  I just spoke to Lanny Davis, who was once his... She gets real excited here in a minute.
[00:58:32.552 --> 00:58:35.753]  Once his ally and his... She needs his blood.
[00:58:35.833 --> 00:58:38.274]  She needs the blood.
[00:58:38.354 --> 00:58:40.155]  And she needs Al-Qaeda.
[00:58:40.175 --> 00:58:42.856]  Meanwhile, Al-Qaeda has a chemical attack.
[00:58:42.876 --> 00:58:45.977]  She's blaming their forces for everything that happened.
[00:58:45.997 --> 00:58:46.818]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:51.735 --> 00:58:55.732]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:59.468 --> 00:59:04.372]  The world is discovering the power of medicinal silver to fight against life-threatening pathogens.
[00:59:04.993 --> 00:59:08.236]  And as a result, dozens of silver solutions have emerged.
[00:59:08.796 --> 00:59:11.678]  You can even make your own colloidal silver at home in your garage.
[00:59:12.219 --> 00:59:15.041]  How do you know which solution is the safest and most effective?
[00:59:15.662 --> 00:59:21.687]  Supernatural Silver is a new patented technology that is made using 10,000 volts of AC current.
[00:59:22.288 --> 00:59:25.711]  This technology is so powerful, it must be made in a laboratory.
[00:59:26.371 --> 00:59:37.055]  Colloidal and ionic silvers use a charge of only 110 volts of DC current, making supernatural silver hundreds of times more effective against viruses, bacteria, and fungus.
[00:59:37.755 --> 00:59:42.717]  Supernatural silver liquid can be used internally, and our silver gel can be used topically.
[00:59:43.257 --> 00:59:51.143]  To find out more information on how Supernatural Silver can help you win the war against deadly pathogens, go to SupernaturalSilver.com.

[01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:18.004]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:18.644 --> 01:00:19.465]  You want answers?
[01:00:20.245 --> 01:00:21.146]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:21.767 --> 01:00:25.350]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:25.970 --> 01:00:30.054]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:42.776 --> 01:00:45.977]  Man, I look at all the amazing news and it makes my head spin.
[01:00:46.517 --> 01:00:49.778]  Absolutely makes my head spin.
[01:00:51.339 --> 01:00:54.980]  They're going after the freedom of the press in this country, calling it a press protection bill.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.341]  We're going to be getting into that in this hour.
[01:00:58.501 --> 01:01:11.586]  We've got a full court press all over television again saying that Assad did launch the chemical attack and that we've got a moral imperative like Serbia and Rwanda to save everyone.
[01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:17.422]  When Serbia and Rwanda on record were engineered by the globalists in both cases.
[01:01:18.662 --> 01:01:23.344]  But they're just targeting the public like they're completely and absolutely totally ignorant.
[01:01:24.025 --> 01:01:27.086]  Meanwhile, it's all coming out, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:01:27.906 --> 01:01:36.930]  It's all coming out right now that the globalists have been caught lying on every single front.
[01:01:40.390 --> 01:01:44.651]  Here are some of the headlines that are up on InfoWars.com.
[01:01:47.272 --> 01:01:49.773]  Wife of man executed by FBI demands justice.
[01:01:49.813 --> 01:01:56.414]  That's big breaking news when we interviewed the wife of the man executed by the FBI at his house.
[01:01:56.434 --> 01:02:02.296]  They declared national security on the death squad operation.
[01:02:04.453 --> 01:02:11.221]  The top story, of course, is a leader of Syrian rebel group calls for attacks inside the US.
[01:02:12.662 --> 01:02:15.124]  Wife of man executed by FBI demands justice.
[01:02:15.184 --> 01:02:16.044]  I just mentioned that.
[01:02:16.625 --> 01:02:19.227]  Kill a family member to join the Illuminati.
[01:02:19.247 --> 01:02:26.712]  Paul Joseph Watson did a very interesting report on some of the amoral degeneracy coming out in the news.
[01:02:27.392 --> 01:02:27.993]  You heard me right.
[01:02:28.013 --> 01:02:29.554]  Kill a family member to join the Illuminati.
[01:02:30.114 --> 01:02:34.817]  CNN propagandist Amanpour demands moral intervention in Syria.
[01:02:35.058 --> 01:02:36.459]  And what I want our crew to do
[01:02:37.509 --> 01:02:40.442]  A story on is when she worked for the British press.
[01:02:40.482 --> 01:02:42.470]  She was involved putting out the fake story.
[01:02:43.868 --> 01:02:45.789]  That was originally generated, what, on ITN?
[01:02:46.330 --> 01:02:49.392]  With the guy behind the barbed wire trying to get into a UN food center?
[01:02:49.412 --> 01:02:50.613]  Who had tuberculosis?
[01:02:50.633 --> 01:02:52.994]  She's like, look at the man in the camp!
[01:02:53.054 --> 01:02:54.035]  It's the Nazis!
[01:02:54.115 --> 01:02:57.217]  I mean, she knows she's up there lying.
[01:02:57.518 --> 01:02:59.099]  She knows Al-Qaeda launched the attacks.
[01:02:59.479 --> 01:03:01.120]  She knows they're going to butcher all the Christians.
[01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:03.922]  They know they want to de-industrialize and implode Syria.
[01:03:04.222 --> 01:03:07.505]  They know they want to bring down and put the jihadis in control of Egypt.
[01:03:07.825 --> 01:03:08.285]  They know!
[01:03:08.345 --> 01:03:10.627]  And she's up there going, we must do it!
[01:03:10.847 --> 01:03:11.728]  I can hardly talk!
[01:03:11.748 --> 01:03:12.728]  I'm so upset!
[01:03:13.899 --> 01:03:17.360]  And then she's up there trying to be an actress, and it's just such a joke!
[01:03:17.801 --> 01:03:19.021]  Lying to their viewers!
[01:03:21.082 --> 01:03:21.622]  Unbelievable.
[01:03:21.702 --> 01:03:27.204]  Nigel Farage, this clip's coming up, confronts EU communist Barroso over global warming hoax.
[01:03:27.644 --> 01:03:29.185]  That's absolutely imploding right now.
[01:03:29.385 --> 01:03:30.526]  Very important report.
[01:03:31.166 --> 01:03:31.846]  War is coming.
[01:03:31.886 --> 01:03:35.728]  Ten reasons why a diplomatic solution in Syria crisis is extremely unlikely.
[01:03:36.673 --> 01:03:39.034]  Russia to expand the Mediterranean Fleet to 10 warships.
[01:03:39.555 --> 01:03:43.857]  We've already got, what, seven there with the carrier killer arriving a couple days ago.
[01:03:43.897 --> 01:03:45.258]  I mean, this is getting serious.
[01:03:45.999 --> 01:03:49.501]  California lawmakers approved a measure to allow driver's licenses for illegal immigrants.
[01:03:49.741 --> 01:03:50.801]  Let me give you a little newsflash.
[01:03:50.821 --> 01:03:51.482]  They already do that.
[01:03:51.962 --> 01:03:53.803]  DMV in Texas gives it to them, too.
[01:03:54.764 --> 01:03:56.545]  Look, and again, I have nothing against the illegals.
[01:03:56.585 --> 01:03:58.386]  A lot of them are actually hard-working, good people.
[01:04:00.126 --> 01:04:04.568]  A generation or two, after being here, just like everybody else's kids, black, white, I don't care.
[01:04:05.229 --> 01:04:09.971]  They are absolutely dependent, spoiled, rotten brats on average, just like white people and black kids.
[01:04:11.972 --> 01:04:14.894]  I mean, it is unbelievable what the culture and the media here does to people.
[01:04:16.315 --> 01:04:27.501]  And I wouldn't have a problem with 30 million illegals here if it was the kind of, you know, cowboy hat, gun-loving, freedom-loving, family-loving type hard-working people that come up here from Mexico.
[01:04:28.081 --> 01:04:40.971]  But, within a generation, it's absolute communist party, white people are all racist and bad, my guns are evil, El Norte is Mexico's, all Ford Foundation globalist garbage, and it's the kiss of death.
[01:04:41.032 --> 01:04:44.935]  It's how the globalists plan to finally bring in the voting bloc to bring this country down.
[01:04:46.436 --> 01:04:47.837]  Hey, can I go to Mexico and have a free baby?
[01:04:48.578 --> 01:04:51.980]  Can I go to Mexico and become a citizen or get a driver's license like that?
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:52.541]  No, I can't.
[01:04:53.567 --> 01:04:56.510]  I can imagine walking into a Mexican hospital saying, I'm here to have my baby paid for.
[01:04:56.550 --> 01:05:01.354]  They'd say, actually, we're going to arrest you and throw you in jail until the police took every dime out of your family.
[01:05:01.374 --> 01:05:04.537]  By the way, we're going to knock your teeth out, too, gringo.
[01:05:09.128 --> 01:05:12.770]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us?
[01:05:13.010 --> 01:05:18.294]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[01:05:18.534 --> 01:05:26.078]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[01:05:26.258 --> 01:05:35.364]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[01:05:35.564 --> 01:05:42.550]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[01:05:42.730 --> 01:05:45.592]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[01:05:45.612 --> 01:05:52.538]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse but demand a war.
[01:05:53.098 --> 01:05:54.019]  Oh, there's another one!
[01:05:54.079 --> 01:05:55.260]  Another plane just hit!
[01:06:08.855 --> 01:06:10.477]  Introducing Pro-1.
[01:06:10.737 --> 01:06:14.240]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[01:06:14.380 --> 01:06:18.784]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[01:06:18.944 --> 01:06:24.909]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[01:06:25.029 --> 01:06:35.819]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.
[01:06:36.019 --> 01:06:42.326]  It is the only one that does it, and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[01:06:42.506 --> 01:06:57.241]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands,
[01:06:57.661 --> 01:07:06.307]  Cal Bend Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soap that is triple concentrated and made from the highest quality vegetable and coconut oils.

[01:08:13.871 --> 01:08:18.076]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:08:18.696 --> 01:08:19.517]  You want answers?
[01:08:20.298 --> 01:08:21.279]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:21.820 --> 01:08:25.403]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:26.024 --> 01:08:30.129]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:42.281 --> 01:08:44.362]  We're now into hour number two.
[01:08:44.622 --> 01:09:02.089]  Ray McGovern, former top CIA analyst to Ronald Reagan, and of course George Bush Sr., their morning briefer, is going to be joining us to give us his expert inside intel on what's happened in Syria and where it's all going and how big a blow this is to the corporate empire that seized America.
[01:09:03.424 --> 01:09:05.605]  Because it's not that Putin's defeating America.
[01:09:05.985 --> 01:09:17.108]  Putin is outmaneuvering the globalists who've just been caught lying and committing crimes worldwide, to where even the dumbest people are waking up to exactly what's happening.
[01:09:17.608 --> 01:09:22.930]  Reuters is reporting that the head of Al-Qaeda chief is calling for attacks on USA.
[01:09:23.950 --> 01:09:26.831]  So is the London Telegraph, but that dovetails with our article.
[01:09:27.311 --> 01:09:29.892]  It's the top story, red-linked on InfoWars.com.
[01:09:31.454 --> 01:09:43.227]  Leader of Syrian rebel group calls for attacks inside the United States, and he just so also happens to be the head of al-Qaeda.
[01:09:44.148 --> 01:09:49.854]  And Ayman al-Zahiri, the leader of Jabhat al-Nusra.
[01:09:50.714 --> 01:10:02.485]  Which is the primary opposition force fighting in Syria has called for terror attacks inside the United States after the Jihad successfully takes over the next goal.
[01:10:02.505 --> 01:10:06.008]  Obama is backing them in the takeover of Egypt.
[01:10:07.031 --> 01:10:08.872]  He is backing them in the takeover of Libya.
[01:10:09.713 --> 01:10:12.495]  He is backing them in the takeover of Syria.
[01:10:13.175 --> 01:10:20.920]  And they have the nerve, after al-Nusra got caught videotaping themselves, they're very proud of it, firing the chemical weapons weeks ago, and back in March.
[01:10:21.540 --> 01:10:22.601]  They've done it over and over again.
[01:10:22.621 --> 01:10:24.722]  It's the only way they can defeat the Syrian forces.
[01:10:25.203 --> 01:10:26.804]  This is with Saudi Arabian chemical weapons.
[01:10:27.204 --> 01:10:34.529]  All this has come out, and they've got Christina Amanpour and Samantha Powers, and all the rest of these, these war whores,
[01:10:34.969 --> 01:10:35.451]  That's what they are.
[01:10:35.471 --> 01:10:37.218]  They're they're they're whoring America out for war.
[01:10:38.561 --> 01:10:42.083]  They're up there on TV saying, how dare us let him kill children!
[01:10:42.524 --> 01:10:50.689]  And it is not a moral equivalent when people get their heads chopped off or get executed to the nerve-gassing of children!
[01:10:51.510 --> 01:10:57.314]  Serbia was wrong, and what happened in Rwanda was wrong, and we've got to do something.
[01:10:57.534 --> 01:11:04.899]  And then meanwhile, they're the ones, with Christina Amanpour, literally running fake video of what they said was a concentration camp.
[01:11:04.939 --> 01:11:06.040]  That's on record.
[01:11:08.015 --> 01:11:14.938]  That she and others pushed video of a guy trying to get into a food station that had barbed wire around it, who had tuberculosis.
[01:11:14.958 --> 01:11:16.638]  There's a fat guy right next to him in the video.
[01:11:17.359 --> 01:11:20.820]  But they said, look at the man in the camp starving to death.
[01:11:21.180 --> 01:11:22.961]  He's in a Serb death camp.
[01:11:23.361 --> 01:11:27.623]  I am Christina Amanpour reporting for the British News.
[01:11:27.923 --> 01:11:30.043]  And then they said, you are such a piece of garbage.
[01:11:30.304 --> 01:11:31.664]  Can we hire you for CNN?
[01:11:32.144 --> 01:11:34.665]  You are our type of piece of trash liar.
[01:11:34.965 --> 01:11:36.406]  We love you, honey baby.
[01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:43.404]  And now she comes on television to lecture all of us, and it's just wall-to-wall.
[01:11:43.464 --> 01:11:45.445]  Kerry, he launched the chemical, a weapon.
[01:11:46.386 --> 01:11:46.986]  I'm on poor.
[01:11:47.046 --> 01:11:47.707]  They launched it.
[01:11:48.667 --> 01:11:49.288]  On and on and on.
[01:11:49.308 --> 01:11:57.253]  Last hour, I played the clip of her saying, hey, it is a, you know, moral imperative, because he's hurting the children, when the West almost three years ago started this.
[01:11:57.473 --> 01:11:58.654]  And I know I've said that over and over again.
[01:11:58.694 --> 01:11:59.635]  I try not to get upset.
[01:12:00.915 --> 01:12:04.338]  It's just at a certain point, this becomes Twilight Zone level.
[01:12:05.339 --> 01:12:08.600]  This is becoming Twilight Zone level by the minute.
[01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:17.143]  And meanwhile, Harry Reid is coming out in the Senate yesterday in a speech saying the Tea Party's been running this country.
[01:12:17.183 --> 01:12:18.783]  Wait a minute, I thought the Tea Party had no power.
[01:12:18.803 --> 01:12:19.923]  I thought they were all racist.
[01:12:20.604 --> 01:12:28.766]  I thought they were all scum, you know, that live in the South as the Democrats who live in the North and the West keep going, oh, Southerners, white racists, scum.
[01:12:29.046 --> 01:12:31.047]  Imagine if he said those Northerners, scum.
[01:12:33.370 --> 01:12:36.392]  The only group you're allowed to really be racist and hateful toward is white southerners.
[01:12:36.432 --> 01:12:43.715]  I mean, because everybody knows they can't talk, they can't tie their shoelaces, they're evil, they own guns, they're bitter clingers on the Bible.
[01:12:43.935 --> 01:12:44.996]  You know, we've heard it all before.
[01:12:45.936 --> 01:12:50.819]  Gene Simmons has come out and defended Thiebaud, saying that if he was wearing a
[01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:54.321]  Burka, they wouldn't dare say anything.
[01:12:54.421 --> 01:12:56.203]  It is because he's Christian and he's being attacked.
[01:12:57.184 --> 01:13:02.128]  Again, college drops ban on veils, ban after Muslim outcry.
[01:13:02.148 --> 01:13:06.131]  That's just all part of the divide and conquer going on, but it's only Christians.
[01:13:06.151 --> 01:13:08.413]  Can you imagine if Muslims were having their heads chopped off en masse?
[01:13:08.813 --> 01:13:10.815]  Al-Qaeda in Syria, then it would be a big issue.
[01:13:12.079 --> 01:13:16.541]  That is just some of the incredible news that is now breaking.
[01:13:16.961 --> 01:13:32.568]  And now it's come out that the Federal Consumer Protection Bureau is to monitor 80% of all credit card transactions, live time, to keep you safe, and they're to basically restrict citizen bloggers and private media groups who aren't working for the Fortune 100.
[01:13:34.383 --> 01:13:48.633]  The bill has passed the Senate committee saying openly that you don't have any anonymity, you don't have journalistic protection, protection under the First Amendment for your sources, if you're not certified by the federal government.
[01:13:48.973 --> 01:13:54.297]  So that's another way they're waging war, and the Drudge Report has properly called it fascism.
[01:13:54.737 --> 01:13:58.240]  And I have directed my reporters and my crew on the nightly news tonight
[01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:06.386]  To review the freedom of the press, the First Amendment, and the war on it by cybersecurity, by homeland security, and what's happening.
[01:14:06.406 --> 01:14:08.367]  Because this is the big issue.
[01:14:10.889 --> 01:14:16.614]  The Pentagon announcing they're going to engage in covert and overt propaganda against independent media, the real media.
[01:14:19.146 --> 01:14:22.930]  That was a declaration of war a month and a half ago, and now you see it happening.
[01:14:23.671 --> 01:14:27.014]  Cyber security saying they're going to target blogs that don't agree with U.S.
[01:14:27.054 --> 01:14:27.455]  policy.
[01:14:27.615 --> 01:14:29.336]  They mean globalist banker policy.
[01:14:30.427 --> 01:14:38.991]  See, propaganda is everywhere, but look at how they go, Putin's defeating America, Putin schools America, knowing it's going to make Americans get mad and go, well, I'm going to support Obama.
[01:14:39.251 --> 01:14:41.212]  I don't want that Russian schooling America.
[01:14:41.492 --> 01:14:42.732]  He's not schooling America.
[01:14:42.932 --> 01:14:46.294]  He's schooling the globalists that have hijacked and occupied the country.
[01:14:46.834 --> 01:14:48.715]  And that's the talking point, because it's the truth.
[01:14:48.955 --> 01:14:49.975]  What are my talking points?
[01:14:50.015 --> 01:14:50.495]  The truth.
[01:14:51.776 --> 01:14:56.138]  America has been hijacked by offshore, above-the-law megabanks.
[01:14:58.354 --> 01:15:03.040]  And it is the REAL Tea Party, not the one that Karl Rove tried to create to hijack.
[01:15:04.181 --> 01:15:04.942]  They've now given up.
[01:15:04.982 --> 01:15:06.143]  The Blue Bloods have just given up.
[01:15:06.183 --> 01:15:06.704]  They're panicking.
[01:15:07.245 --> 01:15:10.769]  Whenever Karl Rove's on Fox, he badmouths the Real Tea Party.
[01:15:11.930 --> 01:15:12.892]  And Ron Paul and Rand Paul.
[01:15:13.632 --> 01:15:14.614]  Whenever, um...
[01:15:16.621 --> 01:15:18.502]  Obama's in a private meeting and it gets leaked.
[01:15:18.562 --> 01:15:19.123]  Or Biden.
[01:15:19.483 --> 01:15:22.725]  And he's talking to their billionaire-type folks that give millions a year.
[01:15:23.125 --> 01:15:24.706]  They're saying, we gotta do something about this Tea Party.
[01:15:24.906 --> 01:15:25.586]  They're dangerous.
[01:15:26.047 --> 01:15:27.107]  They could really take us out.
[01:15:27.648 --> 01:15:28.248]  They're the enemy.
[01:15:28.268 --> 01:15:31.090]  And then Homeland Security says, we're the terrorists, because we're Americans.
[01:15:31.150 --> 01:15:36.493]  Pro-gun, pro-family, pro-free market, pro-Constitution, pro-rule of law.
[01:15:36.613 --> 01:15:37.514]  Man, we are...
[01:15:38.234 --> 01:15:46.457]  We are big, huge, wooden oak stakes and holy water and high noon to these people.
[01:15:47.417 --> 01:15:54.740]  We are high noon to Count Dracula and Nosferatu and all the rest of these New World Order scum, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:58.382]  We are the end of them.
[01:16:00.532 --> 01:16:03.294]  See, notice that you don't have any power.
[01:16:03.675 --> 01:16:04.135]  It's over.
[01:16:04.175 --> 01:16:05.256]  America's socialist.
[01:16:05.556 --> 01:16:06.657]  Obama got re-elected.
[01:16:06.677 --> 01:16:09.079]  Everybody has a mandate for communism now.
[01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:11.921]  Clearly election fraud.
[01:16:12.782 --> 01:16:14.403]  Clearly a ringer who ran against him.
[01:16:14.423 --> 01:16:16.025]  The guy that wrote with big industry.
[01:16:16.405 --> 01:16:22.190]  The Obamacare, you know, O-Rapacare, O-Scamacare written by the foreign banks.
[01:16:22.750 --> 01:16:28.435]  On record to absolutely just destroy our healthcare system and make you pay money to the big insurance companies owned by foreign banks.
[01:16:28.955 --> 01:16:29.896]  All of this came out.
[01:16:31.343 --> 01:16:36.545]  All of this came out and now they're red alerting on the Senate floor.
[01:16:37.845 --> 01:16:44.608]  They are red alerting going, these people are running the country and things aren't going to get better until we get rid of them.
[01:16:45.188 --> 01:16:47.328]  You globalists are running the country.
[01:16:48.029 --> 01:16:49.249]  No, no, no, we're not running it.
[01:16:49.289 --> 01:16:53.470]  We are running the agenda now because we're telling the truth and people resonate with it.
[01:16:55.711 --> 01:16:57.532]  I don't have teleprompters, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:16:58.795 --> 01:17:07.562]  I've got a heart of prompter, and a mind of prompter, and a historical research of prompter, and a guts of prompter, and a liberty prompter.
[01:17:08.283 --> 01:17:09.204]  You know what I'm looking for?
[01:17:09.244 --> 01:17:18.451]  I'm looking for them to be defeated and not get our guns, and to get the floor out of the water, and to get real vaccines out there that aren't filled with stuff on purpose to brain damage people, and to get the GMO out of our food.
[01:17:20.213 --> 01:17:22.395]  That's what I'm ready to die to get liberty, folks.
[01:17:22.415 --> 01:17:23.375]  That's all I care about.
[01:17:23.896 --> 01:17:24.977]  I take it personal.
[01:17:25.037 --> 01:17:27.319]  I mean, I'm all the way against these people, and I'm alive.
[01:17:29.312 --> 01:17:31.192]  And they can't deal with people like that, folks.
[01:17:32.013 --> 01:17:33.133]  They cannot deal with us.
[01:17:33.573 --> 01:17:34.733]  We are the Americans.
[01:17:35.013 --> 01:17:35.913]  They are the enemy.
[01:17:36.193 --> 01:17:42.555]  Let's go to this clip of Harry Reid, I don't know if I can play the whole thing, going into panic mode on the Senate floor about the Tea Party.
[01:17:42.575 --> 01:17:42.975]  Here it is.
[01:17:43.955 --> 01:17:47.756]  And I would also talk about my friend from Oklahoma.
[01:17:48.816 --> 01:17:50.236]  I know that he's smart.
[01:17:52.457 --> 01:17:54.277]  And he, and I understand that.
[01:17:55.117 --> 01:17:57.798]  But Madam President, just because you're smart doesn't mean you're always right.
[01:17:59.062 --> 01:18:06.370]  Madam President, we have a situation where this country has been driven by the Tea Party for the last number of years.
[01:18:07.951 --> 01:18:15.660]  When I was in school, I studied government and I learned about the anarchists.
[01:18:16.681 --> 01:18:20.865]  Now they were different than the Tea Party because they were violent.
[01:18:22.193 --> 01:18:26.877]  But they were anarchists because they did not believe in government at any level, and they acknowledged it.
[01:18:27.377 --> 01:18:29.579]  The PT Party kind of hides that.
[01:18:30.639 --> 01:18:33.161]  They don't say we're against government, that's what it all amounts to.
[01:18:33.361 --> 01:18:34.722]  We're against rogue government.
[01:18:35.043 --> 01:18:40.387]  They're not doing physically destructive things to buildings and people, directly.
[01:18:40.687 --> 01:18:50.574]  But they are doing everything they can to throw a monkey wrench into any form of government, whether it's local, whether it's state or federal government.
[01:18:50.694 --> 01:18:51.575]  That's what it's all about.
[01:18:52.452 --> 01:18:59.514]  And so, anything they can do to throw a monkey wrench in the wheels of government, they're happy doing that.
[01:19:00.214 --> 01:19:03.755]  And I'm sorry to say my friend from Oklahoma is helping them.
[01:19:03.855 --> 01:19:05.336]  Maybe not directly, but indirectly.
[01:19:05.376 --> 01:19:06.076]  And that's wrong.
[01:19:07.176 --> 01:19:10.297]  Government is not inherently bad.
[01:19:10.837 --> 01:19:12.278]  Government is inherently good.
[01:19:12.538 --> 01:19:13.958]  That's why we have a Constitution.
[01:19:22.134 --> 01:19:23.095]  Oh, what a tyrant.
[01:19:23.195 --> 01:19:25.397]  I mean, that is a flaming tyrant, folks.
[01:19:25.597 --> 01:19:29.380]  That's like Obama saying, don't listen to voices that say tyranny's always around the corner.
[01:19:29.941 --> 01:19:30.301]  No, you're right.
[01:19:30.321 --> 01:19:31.882]  It's always in our living rooms.
[01:19:31.902 --> 01:19:33.023]  It's always taking over our lives.
[01:19:33.063 --> 01:19:41.630]  I mean, these people, by every benchmark, secret arrests, torture, all these wars, funding Al Qaeda, NSA surveillance of everybody.
[01:19:42.871 --> 01:19:47.573]  Targeting the Tea Party, the head of the IRS got caught lying, now she was ordered to target.
[01:19:47.613 --> 01:19:50.874]  She said in the memos, these people are dangerous, we gotta shut them down.
[01:19:51.554 --> 01:19:57.676]  Well yeah, we're dangerous to authoritarians that, like Mao Zedong, I mean like half his czars promote Mao.
[01:19:58.836 --> 01:20:01.397]  I'm sorry we're freaked out that Mao killed 80 million people.
[01:20:01.637 --> 01:20:04.238]  I'm sorry we listen to George Washington about the danger of government.
[01:20:04.458 --> 01:20:07.219]  I'm sorry we're Americans, you little piece of trash.
[01:20:09.707 --> 01:20:12.468]  Protecting your home with a security system is a must.
[01:20:12.688 --> 01:20:18.730]  But when it comes to protecting your family, your home and belongings, there's no need to sign a long-term contract.
[01:20:19.070 --> 01:20:25.493]  Listen, there is some real scum in the alarm business cashing in by locking you into long, punishing contracts.
[01:20:25.873 --> 01:20:27.833]  Not with SimpliSafe Home Security.
[01:20:28.174 --> 01:20:29.214]  They're the good guys.

[01:22:09.613 --> 01:22:13.935]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:22:14.095 --> 01:22:19.716]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:22:19.816 --> 01:22:23.157]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[01:23:07.489 --> 01:23:08.250]  My name's Bruno.
[01:23:08.370 --> 01:23:09.472]  I'm 52 years old.
[01:23:09.752 --> 01:23:13.257]  I've tried different protein powders over the years and they've all tasted pretty bad.
[01:23:13.357 --> 01:23:15.420]  I tried One World Way and found it to be delicious.
[01:23:15.640 --> 01:23:21.207]  After 10 weeks on One World Way, my wife commented, you have more muscles and you're leaner than when you were 20 years old.
[01:23:21.608 --> 01:23:23.170]  My body has changed dramatically.
[01:23:23.710 --> 01:23:24.371]  I'm a cyclist.
[01:23:24.611 --> 01:23:27.152]  Normally I'll ride two days on and take two days off.
[01:23:27.652 --> 01:23:37.418]  After being on One World Way, I rode 10 days in a row in over 100 degree heat and then I take another two servings of One World Way and then work out at the gym for another hour and a half.
[01:23:37.778 --> 01:23:39.479]  I just couldn't believe these results.
[01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:43.502]  My normal muscle tightness and soreness after working out are virtually gone.
[01:23:44.162 --> 01:23:45.283]  Don't take my word for it.
[01:23:45.663 --> 01:23:47.284]  One World Way comes in single servings.
[01:23:47.684 --> 01:23:48.585]  Just give it a try.
[01:23:49.187 --> 01:23:52.230]  For a health and taste sensation you'll love, call 888-988-3325.
[01:23:52.270 --> 01:23:52.570]  That's 888-988-3325.
[01:23:52.611 --> 01:23:53.051]  That's 888-988-3325.
[01:23:53.151 --> 01:23:54.873]  Or visit OneWorldWay.com.
[01:23:54.913 --> 01:23:55.794]  That's OneWorld, W-H-E-Y.com.
[01:24:20.326 --> 01:24:35.276]  When Ray McGovern leaves us in about 20 minutes or so, I'm going to get into the attack on the press, not just the Fairness Doctrine to shut down free speech on talk radio with the Orwellian name Fairness Doctrine.
[01:24:35.616 --> 01:24:36.977]  No, it's passed the Senate committee.
[01:24:38.106 --> 01:24:49.491]  To have the government certify which journalistic operations will be allowed into events, will be allowed to basically have protection of their sources, you name it.
[01:24:49.611 --> 01:24:53.012]  It's extremely, extremely fascistic what's going on.
[01:24:53.913 --> 01:24:55.694]  Joining us is Ray McGovern.
[01:24:56.854 --> 01:25:02.797]  And he, of course, was one of the top national security briefers for Ronald Reagan and George Bush Sr.
[01:25:04.111 --> 01:25:10.916]  And he joins us in this segment and part of the next to break down exactly what we see happening.
[01:25:11.836 --> 01:25:13.738]  He's a native of New York and Washington.
[01:25:14.198 --> 01:25:16.539]  He was an army infantry officer during Vietnam.
[01:25:16.900 --> 01:25:20.842]  He served as a CIA analyst from the administration of John F. Kennedy to George H.W.
[01:25:20.882 --> 01:25:21.123]  Bush.
[01:25:22.302 --> 01:25:26.585]  And he was one of the most high-level national security advisors from 81 to 85.
[01:25:26.705 --> 01:25:30.248]  He's fluent from everything in Russian to German to Spanish.
[01:25:30.989 --> 01:25:34.251]  And I'm not going to get into all the rest of his degrees from Harvard and the rest of it.
[01:25:34.511 --> 01:25:35.572]  He's also a theologian.
[01:25:36.533 --> 01:25:37.454]  Good to have you with us.
[01:25:38.214 --> 01:25:40.697]  I want to get your take, sir, on the state of the world first.
[01:25:40.737 --> 01:25:41.918]  Give us a briefing on that.
[01:25:42.518 --> 01:25:43.780]  How historical this is.
[01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:47.524]  Could this be the beginning of the end of the Anglo-American Empire?
[01:25:47.544 --> 01:25:52.108]  And what do you make of the entire Syria situation?
[01:25:52.949 --> 01:26:00.116]  And the briefing you sent to the President last week, warning him of all the top analysts that you talked to, saying this was clearly a fraud by the rebels.
[01:26:00.857 --> 01:26:11.225]  And now it appears that they're diplomatically being defeated but they're still escalating the military force and what they plan to do once Al-Qaeda and Al-Nusra is in control of Syria.
[01:26:11.625 --> 01:26:13.127]  So, Ray McGovern, thank you for coming on, sir.
[01:26:13.947 --> 01:26:15.108]  You're most welcome, Alex.
[01:26:17.330 --> 01:26:20.252]  Well, let me just talk about Cui Bono.
[01:26:20.512 --> 01:26:22.794]  I think that's a good place to start.
[01:26:23.975 --> 01:26:27.438]  Cui Bono means, who profits from all this?
[01:26:28.775 --> 01:26:37.166]  What country expects to profit from continual violence, the kind of things that we've seen in Syria for over two years now?
[01:26:37.927 --> 01:26:39.910]  And the answer to that is very simple.
[01:26:39.970 --> 01:26:40.491]  It's Israel.
[01:26:41.494 --> 01:26:54.241]  As long as the Sunni and the Shia are at each other's throats—not only in Syria, by the way, but in the whole adjacent area—the better it is in terms of how the Israelis look at this.
[01:26:54.721 --> 01:27:04.307]  For their strategic planning, namely, they face a lot less threat from either Sunni or Shia, as long as they're at each other's throats.
[01:27:05.231 --> 01:27:13.389]  Now, so, is there incentive for the Israelis to camp down that struggle?
[01:27:14.110 --> 01:27:18.953]  Well, not only is there no incentive for that, there is incentive to keep it going.
[01:27:19.254 --> 01:27:40.288]  There was a really interesting report in the New York Times, of all places, Alex, on the 30th of August, and it talked about this young journalist in Jerusalem who had talked to senior Israeli officials, security and military officials, and she asked them, you know, what's the best outcome in Syria for Israel's interests?
[01:27:40.528 --> 01:27:41.809]  And they said, oh, that's easy.
[01:27:41.829 --> 01:27:42.750]  No outcome.
[01:27:43.695 --> 01:27:44.657]  And should I beg your pardon?
[01:27:44.677 --> 01:27:49.225]  No, just keep the pot boiling.
[01:27:49.605 --> 01:27:53.713]  We feel very secure as long as people are killing each other and they're not killing us.
[01:27:54.489 --> 01:28:12.616]  And she explored it a little further, and she found out, much to her amazement, that she might have listened to your program and been prepared for this, that Israel and its big patron, the United States of America, have this interest in not letting al-Qaeda win, of course, but to keep the pot boiling.
[01:28:13.176 --> 01:28:18.018]  Now, how best to prevent al-Qaeda and al-Nusra from winning?
[01:28:18.038 --> 01:28:19.939]  Well, that's pretty simple.
[01:28:20.459 --> 01:28:21.299]  You get the U.S.
[01:28:21.359 --> 01:28:21.799]  involved.
[01:28:22.820 --> 01:28:23.620]  Now, John Kerry,
[01:28:24.898 --> 01:28:28.121]  Who, I think, is one of those neoconservatives.
[01:28:28.462 --> 01:28:40.314]  The definition of a neoconservative is a person who has great difficulty distinguishing between what he or she perceives to be the strategic interests of Israel, on the one hand,
[01:28:41.533 --> 01:28:50.480]  I don't fault them for that.
[01:28:50.921 --> 01:29:03.230]  I mean, everybody seems to have the devout opinion, but they shouldn't be making policy for the United States of America if they think that everything Israel does or everything Israel wants is ipso facto.
[01:29:03.550 --> 01:29:05.051]  The best thing for us Americans.
[01:29:05.451 --> 01:29:06.012]  It is not.
[01:29:06.292 --> 01:29:07.713]  It is demonstrably not.
[01:29:08.153 --> 01:29:15.457]  And John Kerry spent as much time over there with Netanyahu and others over the last couple of months as anyone else.
[01:29:16.098 --> 01:29:32.208]  Ostensibly, he was looking for a way to get the peace talks started again between the Palestinians and the Israelis that came not only to North, it came to further settlements on the West Bank and other occupied territories, clearly illegal.
[01:29:32.928 --> 01:29:39.850]  And when the Europeans said, you know, that's illegal, we ought to grace the Israelis with it, John Kerry was the first.
[01:29:39.890 --> 01:29:42.390]  They said, no, no, no, no, don't criticize the Israelis.
[01:29:42.410 --> 01:29:45.151]  Hi, Ray McGovern, we've got to go to break.
[01:29:45.311 --> 01:29:46.251]  Ray, we've got to go to break.
[01:29:47.812 --> 01:29:50.952]  We're going to come right back and continue on that line.
[01:29:50.972 --> 01:29:52.213]  We looked at the Israeli angle.
[01:29:52.713 --> 01:29:56.934]  Then I want to look at, in general, how this is going for the establishment.
[01:29:56.974 --> 01:29:57.794]  I want to get your take on that.
[01:29:58.359 --> 01:30:01.367]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.

[01:31:09.081 --> 01:31:13.662]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[01:31:13.802 --> 01:31:16.763]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[01:31:16.923 --> 01:31:22.164]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[01:31:22.484 --> 01:31:24.064]  It all comes down to one thing.
[01:31:24.404 --> 01:31:25.705]  We are what we eat.
[01:31:26.046 --> 01:31:30.389]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[01:31:30.709 --> 01:31:34.713]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[01:31:34.933 --> 01:31:37.275]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[01:31:37.495 --> 01:31:39.877]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicists.
[01:31:40.137 --> 01:31:40.457]  We're good.

[01:33:26.598 --> 01:33:36.321]  Well, he served from the 60s under JFK right through until the early 1990s as the top briefer to the presidents for the CIA.
[01:33:36.361 --> 01:33:39.542]  And I've asked him to give us a briefing on what he believes is behind all this.
[01:33:39.602 --> 01:33:40.522]  Ray McGovern's our guest.
[01:33:40.542 --> 01:33:42.363]  We're going back to him here in just a moment.
[01:33:42.383 --> 01:33:46.624]  I want to get his big picture on the whole world now and how things are going for the West over there.
[01:33:47.584 --> 01:33:49.325]  And his analysis is sadly spot on.
[01:33:49.365 --> 01:33:51.786]  It's order out of chaos, break the country in multiple parts.
[01:33:52.606 --> 01:33:57.030]  That's just absolutely wicked, and very, very sad to see the West being part of this.
[01:33:57.050 --> 01:33:58.031]  We're going to go back to him in a moment.
[01:33:58.652 --> 01:34:03.877]  First off, InfoWarsStore.com, where we can link through via InfoWars.com.
[01:34:04.598 --> 01:34:07.400]  That's how we fund most of what we do here on air.
[01:34:08.141 --> 01:34:16.390]  We've got the high-quality water filtration systems like ProPure to cut out the glyphosates and the sodium fluoride and the poisons that get in our water supply.
[01:34:17.010 --> 01:34:20.374]  We have the lowest priced, best gravity-fed stainless steel systems out there.
[01:34:20.394 --> 01:34:23.317]  Side-by-side comparisons blows away the competition.

[01:34:27.843 --> 01:34:29.244]  Promo code WATER.

[01:34:33.107 --> 01:34:35.349]  We've got the LifeStraw, a lot of other great filtration systems.
[01:34:35.689 --> 01:34:36.570]  The best stuff out there.
[01:34:36.590 --> 01:34:37.451]  We've done the research.
[01:34:37.991 --> 01:34:41.014]  It's all available at InfowarsStore.com.

[01:35:26.277 --> 01:35:28.499]  It is not political correctness.
[01:35:28.519 --> 01:35:33.304]  You know, you can slaughter all the Christians in Syria and that's not sectarian or racist.
[01:35:35.205 --> 01:35:36.946]  Under, you know, this globalist operation.
[01:35:36.986 --> 01:35:42.347]  But if you have a brown bag in Seattle, well, you're going to get in trouble because that's code word for racism.
[01:35:42.387 --> 01:35:47.468]  I mean, this is, this is the mental illness they're trying to inject out there for balkanization.
[01:35:47.508 --> 01:35:49.889]  So, infowarestore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:35:53.610 --> 01:35:56.071]  And Ray McGovern joins us when he leaves us.
[01:35:56.091 --> 01:36:00.092]  We'll give you some of the great news sites that he's affiliated with as well.
[01:36:00.112 --> 01:36:02.173]  I know he's got his Ray McGovern site.
[01:36:02.213 --> 01:36:03.253]  There's News Consortium.
[01:36:03.293 --> 01:36:07.395]  We'll ask him which one is the best for folks to visit here in a moment.
[01:36:07.655 --> 01:36:10.136]  But Ray, I wanted to throw this out at you first here.
[01:36:10.176 --> 01:36:10.336]  Look.
[01:36:11.696 --> 01:36:12.437]  I've gone over this.
[01:36:12.457 --> 01:36:17.802]  You've got Turkey wanting to expand its empire and maybe grab a piece of Syria.
[01:36:17.902 --> 01:36:21.366]  You've got Israel wanting to play Shiite off against Sunni.
[01:36:21.987 --> 01:36:26.091]  And you've got the West wanting that in Egypt as well, and Obama supporting that.
[01:36:26.131 --> 01:36:26.571]  And you've got...
[01:36:27.546 --> 01:36:29.989]  The military-industrial complex.
[01:36:30.349 --> 01:36:36.216]  83% more money given to the senators that voted to vote the war resolution a few weeks ago out of the Senate.
[01:36:36.696 --> 01:36:37.317]  Or last week.
[01:36:37.417 --> 01:36:39.159]  You've got all that going on.
[01:36:39.980 --> 01:36:42.863]  You've got Obama with his seven scandals wanting a distraction.
[01:36:43.704 --> 01:36:46.387]  And clearly, Israel's tried to act like
[01:36:47.148 --> 01:36:49.650]  That they haven't been trying to play people off against each other.
[01:36:50.131 --> 01:36:52.433]  I've had Israelis call in and say, no, no, we know this.
[01:36:52.453 --> 01:36:54.635]  You know, we know this is what's really going on.
[01:36:54.655 --> 01:37:07.105]  And I believe, as the Russians said, and I said it before they said it, that there may be chemical weapons launched by al-Nusra or other al-Qaeda groups against Israel as a wink-wink deal to allow it to go on.
[01:37:07.125 --> 01:37:10.789]  And I know they do plan on having an American force when they, quote, implode it.
[01:37:11.249 --> 01:37:24.599]  The thing Kerry says he doesn't want is what they admit is the actual plan, as you know, in the Brzezinski-type documents, to go in and break it in at least two pieces, maybe three, and implode it, let al-Qaeda get in, and then say, oh, we gotta go in to stop al-Qaeda.
[01:37:24.959 --> 01:37:27.301]  So I agree with your analysis completely.
[01:37:27.842 --> 01:37:30.103]  My question for you is we know that's going on.
[01:37:30.163 --> 01:37:31.144]  My audience knows that.
[01:37:31.504 --> 01:37:33.326]  What I really want to pick your brain on
[01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:37.624]  He's the 91% in Reuters' poll against this.
[01:37:37.664 --> 01:37:41.149]  The 500-to-1 phone calls to Congress on record Republican and Democrat.
[01:37:41.410 --> 01:37:43.333]  Rush Limbaugh saying it may be a false flag.
[01:37:43.353 --> 01:37:44.054]  That's a big deal.
[01:37:45.316 --> 01:37:46.698]  Glenn Beck saying false flag.
[01:37:46.738 --> 01:37:47.919]  Ron Paul's Rand Paul.
[01:37:48.220 --> 01:37:48.901]  Pat Buchanan.
[01:37:50.129 --> 01:37:51.390]  The Drudge Report exposing it.
[01:37:52.191 --> 01:38:00.497]  The so-called libertarian right really actually acting like libertarians coming out against it, while the so-called left has been cheerleading it.
[01:38:00.677 --> 01:38:08.282]  I wanted your expertise on the sea change we're seeing, if you believe that's one, and many experts like Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, myself.
[01:38:10.344 --> 01:38:19.489]  Folks in the New York Sun saying they believe this signifies the beginning of the implosion of the Anglo-American Empire that, you know, Israel's part of.
[01:38:20.430 --> 01:38:23.792]  And then Saudi Arabia also wants a piece of this.
[01:38:23.832 --> 01:38:25.113]  So, how are they involved?
[01:38:25.313 --> 01:38:27.194]  I've given you a large question there.
[01:38:27.234 --> 01:38:28.935]  Try to give us your answer, please, sir.
[01:38:30.396 --> 01:38:38.961]  Well, this is a major defeat for those who want to promote Israel's objectives in Syria and elsewhere in that part of the world.
[01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:52.568]  The President has been made to look rather ridiculous by depending on, well, the tough guys and now the tough gals in the White House and the U.N.
[01:38:52.588 --> 01:38:55.751]  Yeah, they went behind the ears, Alex.
[01:38:56.091 --> 01:39:00.134]  They don't know which side is up and what really happened here.
[01:39:00.294 --> 01:39:02.636]  And this is of more than passing interest.
[01:39:03.216 --> 01:39:06.519]  You'll recall that barely two weeks ago, on August 30th,
[01:39:07.826 --> 01:39:13.489]  John Kerry got up and said we know about these chemical weapons and we know that Assad is a really bad guy.
[01:39:13.789 --> 01:39:17.691]  He said we know no less than 35 times, okay?
[01:39:17.751 --> 01:39:19.212]  And that was supposed to persuade him.
[01:39:19.232 --> 01:39:20.613]  Ray, we're having trouble hearing you.
[01:39:20.633 --> 01:39:22.154]  Can you put the cell phone close to your mouth?
[01:39:22.194 --> 01:39:22.554]  Thank you.
[01:39:22.754 --> 01:39:23.094]  Sure.
[01:39:24.555 --> 01:39:25.375]  Is this a little better?
[01:39:25.596 --> 01:39:26.436]  Oh, that's night and day.
[01:39:26.496 --> 01:39:26.796]  Thank you.
[01:39:26.836 --> 01:39:27.417]  Please go ahead.
[01:39:27.437 --> 01:39:27.757]  Okay.
[01:39:29.017 --> 01:39:31.018]  So he was asking us, you know, trust us.
[01:39:31.439 --> 01:39:31.839]  Trust us.
[01:39:32.569 --> 01:39:38.511]  Now, they released a four-page document that was bereft of any detail that anyone could check.
[01:39:39.171 --> 01:39:56.876]  And in that document itself, it said, well, while we have high confidence in our assessment—see, everything is an assessment, nothing in the way of evidence was at use—we have high confidence in our assessment, and this is the next best thing to having it confirmed.
[01:40:00.423 --> 01:40:03.846]  So we're going to go to war without confirmation that any of this is true.
[01:40:04.406 --> 01:40:28.685]  So what happened here is, on that Friday night, General Dempsey, the chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, or perhaps it was Saturday morning, he got to the President of the United States and he said, look, Mr. President, we know that you're very fond of those sophomores that you have around you there in the White House and those tough guys and gals, but, you know, they don't know as much about war.
[01:40:29.878 --> 01:40:30.258]  We do.
[01:40:30.819 --> 01:40:31.159]  Okay?
[01:40:31.760 --> 01:40:39.889]  And we're telling you that the notion we can do an extraordinarily clean strike and not expect retaliation, well, forget about it.
[01:40:39.909 --> 01:40:41.511]  That's not the way it's going to go down.
[01:40:41.531 --> 01:40:42.091]  Okay?
[01:40:44.921 --> 01:40:47.462]  Every one of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was against this thing.
[01:40:47.962 --> 01:40:48.282]  M.C.
[01:40:48.362 --> 01:41:01.364]  finally had the guts to stand up and say, now, Mr. President, not only do we think this is a fool's errand, but, you know, I don't want to have to answer the question that would inevitably be asked, and that is, why do you have to do this now?
[01:41:02.425 --> 01:41:03.565]  Why couldn't you wait for the U.N.
[01:41:03.605 --> 01:41:04.245]  inspectors?
[01:41:04.885 --> 01:41:05.825]  Shades of Iraq.
[01:41:06.025 --> 01:41:07.586]  Why couldn't you wait for the U.N.
[01:41:07.646 --> 01:41:09.086]  inspectors to come forward?
[01:41:09.659 --> 01:41:15.950]  Well, you know, we can do this, Mr. President, tomorrow, or next week, or next month.
[01:41:16.130 --> 01:41:17.513]  It doesn't make any difference.
[01:41:17.713 --> 01:41:20.178]  So, if they ask me that, I'm going to say,
[01:41:20.919 --> 01:41:25.260]  At least the hell out of me, why don't you go ask the President or one of his smart little sophomores?
[01:41:26.621 --> 01:41:31.662]  Now, to me, that's not a too-fed language, but that's what he told them, and how do I know that?
[01:41:32.242 --> 01:41:50.588]  Well, when the President got up and shocked everybody out of their mind, less than a day later, when he went into the Rose Garden and said precisely that, he said, uh, my Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff tells me that there's no urgency here, that we can do this today or tomorrow, or
[01:41:51.048 --> 01:41:52.511]  Next week or next month.
[01:41:52.951 --> 01:41:55.675]  And so we're going to go to Congress and get the authorization.
[01:41:56.236 --> 01:41:57.839]  Well, what happens the next day?
[01:41:58.660 --> 01:41:59.261]  John can't.
[01:41:59.361 --> 01:42:00.002]  John's a kid.
[01:42:00.766 --> 01:42:10.556]  And Lindsey Graham stormed into the White House, came out after half an hour, and before the cameras they said, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has gone soft on this thing.
[01:42:10.597 --> 01:42:11.878]  He screwed the whole thing up.
[01:42:12.358 --> 01:42:18.445]  He told the President that he doesn't have to do this, he does have to do it, he does have to do it, and they stamped their feet and he said he does have to do it.
[01:42:18.985 --> 01:42:22.289]  So, what happened here is the President finally got some sense into it.
[01:42:23.075 --> 01:42:40.422]  And with that support from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, dissuading him from going ahead without congressional approval, without international approval, with no approval except for Samantha Power and Susan Rice and a couple of the other sophomores there, he decided to do the right thing.
[01:42:40.982 --> 01:42:41.202]  No.
[01:42:41.642 --> 01:42:47.124]  As the week went on, each attempt by the sophomores was counterproductive.
[01:42:47.564 --> 01:42:52.165]  The opposition to a military strike on Syria grew instead of diminished.
[01:42:52.625 --> 01:42:59.407]  By the end of the week, it looked like you would not only lose in the House, which everyone kind of assumed, but in the Senate as well.
[01:42:59.427 --> 01:43:00.787]  So what happens then?
[01:43:01.460 --> 01:43:05.804]  Well, on Monday morning, just this past Monday, John Kerry is coming home, right?
[01:43:06.004 --> 01:43:10.328]  And he stops in London, and he does a little press thing, speaking from his speaking point.
[01:43:10.908 --> 01:43:13.750]  And Natalie asks him an unscripted question.
[01:43:13.770 --> 01:43:24.800]  She said, Secretary Kerry, could you tell me, you know, is there anything at all that the Syrian regime could do now to avoid being struck by the United States military forces?
[01:43:25.835 --> 01:43:28.218]  Yeah, of course they can.
[01:43:28.638 --> 01:43:37.567]  They can destroy all their chemical weapons or give them over to international control, give a full accounting of them, and yeah, boy, that's never going to happen.
[01:43:37.808 --> 01:43:39.930]  That'll never happen.
[01:43:40.310 --> 01:43:43.233]  It's about 10 o'clock in the morning London time, right?
[01:43:43.253 --> 01:43:44.134]  10.30 London time.
[01:43:47.097 --> 01:43:57.788]  The State Department says... Well, Secretary Kerry was just rhetorically saying that this might be great if, you know, but it was just... It was a rhetorical point he was making, okay?
[01:43:58.308 --> 01:43:59.089]  One hell of a later...
[01:44:00.020 --> 01:44:09.366]  The Soviet, the Russian foreign minister gets up, Lavrov, and he says, hey, how about, hey, Syria destroying all its nuclear weapons under U.N.
[01:44:09.386 --> 01:44:14.409]  supervision and signing the treaty, and we think these Syrians will agree to this.
[01:44:14.829 --> 01:44:25.055]  And sure enough, Syrians two hours later agree to it, and Obama is sent a lifeline out of this ridiculous situation that he got himself into.
[01:44:25.635 --> 01:44:28.457]  Now, why was it that Kerry was blindsided by this?
[01:44:29.560 --> 01:44:32.743]  Because the Russians know that Kerry doesn't want peace.
[01:44:33.744 --> 01:44:37.027]  He's acting in favor of Israel's interests.
[01:44:37.047 --> 01:44:39.870]  He's spent a lot of time with Netanyahu over the last few weeks.
[01:44:39.890 --> 01:44:41.571]  This is all very, very well planned.
[01:44:41.652 --> 01:44:48.698]  Okay, well I want to talk big picture here because it's on record that the rebels have been caught in Turkey with chemical weapons.
[01:44:48.718 --> 01:44:52.202]  They've been caught loading them and firing them several times before this.
[01:44:53.226 --> 01:45:01.150]  The propaganda in our media is pointed at the lowest common denominator, but it doesn't work because the military now knows we're arming Al-Qaeda.
[01:45:01.530 --> 01:45:03.071]  The military is freaking out.
[01:45:03.952 --> 01:45:06.713]  You've got members of Congress calling it is a false flag.
[01:45:07.373 --> 01:45:09.415]  So the whole agenda is falling.
[01:45:09.495 --> 01:45:19.660]  And listen, my only issue is in the camps out there, there are people that say Saudi Arabia is behind it, or Israel's behind it, or Obama wants a distraction.
[01:45:20.140 --> 01:45:20.961]  I see it as
[01:45:22.094 --> 01:45:33.409]  As not taking guilt away from any of the groups, but I see it as an alignment of interest, a bunch of groups that politically and militarily and economically like what's happening, but the world's waking up to how immoral it is.
[01:45:33.810 --> 01:45:37.715]  You keep going back to Israel, and I respect your view and your research and your sources.
[01:45:38.516 --> 01:45:41.357]  Are you saying that all of this is Israel?
[01:45:41.377 --> 01:45:44.338]  I mean, why is Saudi Arabia offering to pay for it then?
[01:45:48.239 --> 01:45:49.759]  We know Netanyahu wants this.
[01:45:50.479 --> 01:46:00.742]  My only issue here is, how is that going to help Israel if it turns into a regional war, Iran attacks them, Syria attacks them, World War III starts?
[01:46:01.262 --> 01:46:04.863]  Which many analysts, I want to get your take on that, say could happen.
[01:46:06.409 --> 01:46:17.498]  And then how could our leaders fumble and act so stupid and so inept and not even get their talking points straight?
[01:46:17.959 --> 01:46:21.261]  As a radio host, I could do a better job sitting here watching.
[01:46:22.583 --> 01:46:24.825]  It's like they're phoning it in or something.
[01:46:25.145 --> 01:46:31.171]  The women are all prancing around, swooping their hair around, like they're on a model runway.
[01:46:31.551 --> 01:46:38.838]  Kerry looks like he's mentally ill, about to collapse in the hearings, like he's dying or something.
[01:46:38.858 --> 01:46:45.104]  I mean, I look at the establishment and I've never seen a more mentally ill looking group.
[01:46:45.124 --> 01:46:46.225]  I've never talked like this.
[01:46:47.839 --> 01:46:52.241]  Those who the gods will destroy, they make, you know, insane first.
[01:46:52.781 --> 01:46:54.582]  Ray, I mean, the big picture here.
[01:46:56.043 --> 01:46:59.964]  You're right to mention Iran, Alex.
[01:47:00.484 --> 01:47:02.365]  This is an extension of the whole thing.
[01:47:02.385 --> 01:47:08.788]  Your listeners probably know that there's a mutual defense treaty between Syria and Iran.
[01:47:09.691 --> 01:47:14.442]  And part of the effort here is to bloody Syria and embarrass Iran.
[01:47:14.462 --> 01:47:20.355]  I hear strange noises from my phone here, so if we go off, I'll get onto a landline.
[01:47:20.996 --> 01:47:30.061]  But if we bloody Syria and Iran stands by idly, not able to really defend their ally, well, Iran will look kind of silly.
[01:47:30.582 --> 01:47:37.386]  But what they're hoping for is that Iran will somehow be implicated and the Israelis can head out, or the U.S.
[01:47:37.406 --> 01:47:39.527]  can head out after Iran as well.
[01:47:40.516 --> 01:47:44.040]  The Sunni-Shia thing, of course, is all important here.
[01:47:44.060 --> 01:47:58.938]  The Saudis are Sunni, the Iranians are Shia, and so if there's a marriage of convenience here with the Saudis and the Israelis having a common objective, well, my enemy is my friend, and so they are in cahoots on this.
[01:47:59.733 --> 01:48:16.857]  Now, what I will mention here, you mentioned the reports that actually it was not the Syrian government, but rather the rebels who were responsible for the chemical event there outside of Damascus on the 21st of August.
[01:48:17.457 --> 01:48:22.798]  There's more teeth in a report that was put out three days ago.
[01:48:23.558 --> 01:48:26.119]  It's written by F. Michael Maloof.
[01:48:27.109 --> 01:48:33.240]  And he's reporting from a classified document that he got access to.
[01:48:33.965 --> 01:48:38.689]  Which shows that Sarin, for example, was available to the Al-Nusra Front.
[01:48:39.349 --> 01:48:57.783]  And this secret, no foreign document gives chapter and verse about how Turkey, the Al-Nusra Front, and others, not only had the capability to use Sarin, but smuggled some into Syria, which is kind of well known to the Turkish police and everyone else.
[01:48:58.456 --> 01:49:19.406]  So there's this palpable reporting now that is check-outable, if I may use that adjective, unlike the administration, which depends on, we assess this, we assess that, we have confidence in this assessment that there's not a shred of detail.
[01:49:20.046 --> 01:49:27.530]  Now, the only other thing that really is interesting to know is that the Israelis apparently had a hand
[01:49:28.254 --> 01:49:39.899]  In this intercept that everyone has been saying shows that Assad knew about, planned, and all this kind of stuff, that chemical event outside of Damascus.
[01:49:40.160 --> 01:49:41.220]  Well, guess what?
[01:49:42.721 --> 01:49:50.764]  If that intercept is available, and if it says what the administration claims it says, what should they do?
[01:49:51.065 --> 01:49:52.505]  They should disclose it.
[01:49:52.565 --> 01:49:53.526]  They should release it.
[01:49:53.746 --> 01:49:56.247]  Now people say, oh no, no, then the Syrians
[01:49:56.687 --> 01:49:58.527]  We know that we're eavesdropping on them.
[01:50:00.928 --> 01:50:01.048]  Whoops.
[01:50:01.648 --> 01:50:02.268]  Are you still there?
[01:50:02.748 --> 01:50:04.289]  Yes, I did hear a click on your phone.
[01:50:04.609 --> 01:50:08.790]  I mean, look, bottom line, Ray McGovern, we know it's a fraud.
[01:50:08.830 --> 01:50:09.910]  The world's seeing it.
[01:50:10.210 --> 01:50:14.031]  So what do you expect to happen in the final equation?
[01:50:14.391 --> 01:50:15.951]  What do you expect their next move?
[01:50:16.491 --> 01:50:18.932]  What do you expect the Obama people to do next?
[01:50:20.538 --> 01:50:22.260]  I think Obama's learned a lot from this.
[01:50:22.980 --> 01:50:30.408]  He's come out smelling not like a rose, at least not smelling as bad as he would have had he authorized these attacks.
[01:50:31.252 --> 01:50:40.902]  There is a prospect that Russia and we can get together and actually cajole or force the various parties back to Geneva.
[01:50:41.623 --> 01:50:43.946]  People say, well Assad wouldn't go to Geneva.
[01:50:44.366 --> 01:50:45.107]  That's a lie.
[01:50:45.127 --> 01:50:50.392]  The Russians... And then we could end this out-of-control civil war, even give him an exit out of the country.
[01:50:50.833 --> 01:50:51.333]  But then...
[01:50:52.094 --> 01:50:56.476]  Turkey, Israel, and Saudi Arabia won't get to carve the nation up.
[01:50:56.897 --> 01:50:58.978]  Ray McGovern, thank you so much.
[01:50:58.998 --> 01:51:05.341]  We're gonna come back with one more quick comment from you on how you think we can end all this, and then we will go into the next hour.
[01:51:05.401 --> 01:51:06.922]  We got Katy Perry's dad joining us.
[01:51:09.704 --> 01:51:10.124]  Hi there.
[01:51:10.704 --> 01:51:11.784]  My name is Frank Bates.
[01:51:12.245 --> 01:51:15.465]  What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.
[01:51:16.065 --> 01:51:24.847]  I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity monopolies and government agencies for what they really are.
[01:51:25.207 --> 01:51:31.228]  Incompetent, lying crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.
[01:51:31.908 --> 01:51:33.509]  Some have called this a conspiracy.
[01:51:34.109 --> 01:51:39.190]  Others have called it a cover-up and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.
[01:51:39.930 --> 01:51:47.018]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them and how you can beat them too.
[01:51:47.859 --> 01:51:52.784]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patrons have already seen in the last three months.
[01:51:53.465 --> 01:51:59.311]  Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect your home.
[01:51:59.952 --> 01:52:05.258]  Go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down.
[01:52:05.658 --> 01:52:06.779]  Again, that's 123coverup.com.
[01:52:15.188 --> 01:52:25.053]  Now, imagine the most extensive survival and disaster preparedness library ever created, with information for every possible scenario, still available to you without online access.
[01:52:25.393 --> 01:52:26.654]  That's the survival key.
[01:52:26.854 --> 01:52:28.195]  Ben Franklin said it best.
[01:52:28.395 --> 01:52:30.716]  By failing to prepare, you're preparing to fail.
[01:52:30.936 --> 01:52:33.638]  Get your survival key at GetSurvivalKey.com.
[01:52:33.878 --> 01:52:36.039]  Quite literally, the key to your survival.

[01:52:38.280 --> 01:52:41.261]  Did you know there are 3 million edible food plants on Earth?
[01:52:41.401 --> 01:52:44.182]  And none have the nutritional value of the hemp plant.
[01:52:44.222 --> 01:52:47.123]  HempUSA.org offers you Hemp Protein Powder.

[01:53:18.215 --> 01:53:24.197]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[01:53:24.317 --> 01:53:35.082]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.

[01:54:32.734 --> 01:54:41.822]  Ladies and gentlemen, I was brought up like any Baptist living in Texas to be extremely pro-Israel.
[01:54:42.982 --> 01:54:45.304]  Watching the Arab countries pile up and attack the country.
[01:54:45.324 --> 01:54:49.007]  I know there's all this old enmity and all these sides just want to beat the other.
[01:54:49.027 --> 01:54:51.389]  The Shiites want to beat the Sunnis.
[01:54:51.429 --> 01:54:52.670]  The Sunnis want to beat the Shiites.
[01:54:53.992 --> 01:54:58.876]  There's different Israeli camps and assassinations and different government parties killing each other there.
[01:54:58.936 --> 01:55:00.237]  So Israel's not even unified.
[01:55:01.431 --> 01:55:06.255]  And I try to stay out of the whole, you're either in the Israel camp or you're in the Arab camp.
[01:55:06.915 --> 01:55:08.297]  It's all just a complete mess.
[01:55:08.437 --> 01:55:10.578]  And I don't think America should be involved in it.
[01:55:11.359 --> 01:55:12.340]  I agree with Rand Paul.
[01:55:13.401 --> 01:55:23.029]  And I separately don't like the Israel lobby, AIPAC, through the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center attacking me.
[01:55:24.332 --> 01:55:30.096]  When I don't agree with everything Israel's doing, because I'm not anti-Jewish, anti-Israel, and I shouldn't have to sit there and preface that.
[01:55:30.437 --> 01:55:36.441]  You can criticize anybody you want, but if you criticize Obama, they say you're racist because he's black, as Ed Asner said.
[01:55:36.461 --> 01:55:37.742]  He's coming on Monday.
[01:55:38.843 --> 01:55:41.785]  And if you criticize Israel, you're anti-Semitic.
[01:55:41.825 --> 01:55:46.328]  Well, I've seen polls in some cases of more than 60% of Israelis against new wars.
[01:55:46.749 --> 01:55:47.629]  Are they anti-Semitic?
[01:55:48.130 --> 01:55:49.451]  This is political correctness.
[01:55:50.583 --> 01:56:01.191]  meant to control people, and I think the the the Likudniks running Israel really are going too far.
[01:56:01.471 --> 01:56:16.662]  Like like many other powerful countries have done, they're biting off more than they can chew, and the military's told Obama this, but again if it was just Israel wanting this, and I'm here criticizing Israel, I think we get blinders on, or almost like tunnel vision, where we need to look at the other
[01:56:17.492 --> 01:56:18.392]  Groups here too.
[01:56:18.933 --> 01:56:22.674]  So Saudi Arabia can be criticized and the arms makers that are lobbying for it.
[01:56:23.135 --> 01:56:26.436]  Because they're not, the arms makers aren't going to have a future if we have World War III.
[01:56:26.816 --> 01:56:29.538]  Ray McGovern, how do you see this ending?
[01:56:30.158 --> 01:56:31.439]  Where do you see this going?
[01:56:32.959 --> 01:56:35.040]  Assad offered to give up his chemicals, now they have.
[01:56:35.100 --> 01:56:38.022]  Samantha Powers, others saying, doesn't matter, it's not about your chemicals.
[01:56:41.300 --> 01:56:49.242]  You know, Alex, it's a completely different situation right now than it was just barely two weeks ago.
[01:56:51.163 --> 01:56:56.625]  Israel has been dealt a very serious setback and so has the Israeli lobby in this country.
[01:56:58.065 --> 01:57:03.247]  Obama has been able to see through what they tried to do in terms of mousetrapping him.
[01:57:04.071 --> 01:57:15.008]  His military, for once, has stood up and said, look, we're interested in fulfilling our promise to the Constitution to defend and protect it against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:57:15.819 --> 01:57:19.402]  So what we have here now is a situation where Obama can move forward.
[01:57:19.882 --> 01:57:20.803]  It's going to take a while.
[01:57:20.823 --> 01:57:22.264]  It's going to be terribly difficult.
[01:57:22.705 --> 01:57:26.307]  But he has the support of the country now, and that's the new element.
[01:57:26.468 --> 01:57:27.588]  The people have spoken.
[01:57:27.949 --> 01:57:29.290]  For once, they've prevailed.
[01:57:30.831 --> 01:57:34.174]  Every now and then, Alex, it's possible to rejoice, okay?
[01:57:34.434 --> 01:57:41.059]  That sounds funny coming from an intelligence professional, but we dodged a big bullet, and so did the Syrians.
[01:57:41.399 --> 01:57:42.741]  We dodged another war.
[01:57:43.001 --> 01:57:44.282]  We should rejoice in that.
[01:57:44.863 --> 01:57:46.826]  Now, if I were Obama, what would I do?
[01:57:48.028 --> 01:57:50.193]  I would take the people that deceived me.
[01:57:50.493 --> 01:57:56.064]  I would take John Brennan and, you know, the admitted perjurer James Clapper.
[01:57:56.524 --> 01:57:57.226]  I would fire them.
[01:57:57.808 --> 01:58:03.191]  I would say, look, you know, whether you were trying to give me plausible denial or not, you lied to me.
[01:58:03.511 --> 01:58:05.832]  You put me up there and I looked really stupid.
[01:58:06.152 --> 01:58:12.696]  Because, you know, you wouldn't even... I couldn't even... You're thinking from the perspective of you were advising the President.
[01:58:13.176 --> 01:58:20.980]  But the question is, he's so compromised and is such a puppet, that's what's so scary, is we've got all these special interests who think they can do whatever they want.
[01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:21.701]  But I agree with you.
[01:58:22.141 --> 01:58:23.141]  We should rejoice.
[01:58:25.420 --> 01:58:32.246]  Yeah, the problem is that, you know, the president still needs a backbone implant.
[01:58:32.626 --> 01:58:38.190]  And the last time I checked at GW Hospital, they're five years away from perfecting that.
[01:58:38.471 --> 01:58:39.191]  Ray, we're out of time.
[01:58:39.231 --> 01:58:40.772]  What's the best website for folks to visit?
[01:58:41.673 --> 01:58:43.054]  RayMcGovern.com.
[01:58:43.555 --> 01:58:44.856]  All right, we've got it up on screen.
[01:58:45.296 --> 01:58:46.197]  Thank you so much, Ray.
[01:58:46.217 --> 01:58:47.097]  We'll talk to you again soon.

[01:58:59.580 --> 01:59:01.641]  It's hurricane and wildfire season again.
[01:59:01.661 --> 01:59:09.263]  Why do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year, betting their lives that the disaster won't get them?
[01:59:09.683 --> 01:59:14.365]  Hundreds of you helped eFoodsDirect ship 50,000 donated meals to the Oklahoma victims.
[01:59:14.625 --> 01:59:16.565]  The problem is we can't help everybody.
[01:59:16.806 --> 01:59:18.166]  If every one of us who can
[01:59:18.166 --> 01:59:18.746]  We're good to go.

[01:59:48.558 --> 01:59:49.798]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:49.818 --> 01:59:51.359]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:13.683 --> 02:00:17.864]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover Ups.
[02:00:18.505 --> 02:00:19.325]  You want answers?
[02:00:20.105 --> 02:00:21.045]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:21.646 --> 02:00:25.247]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:25.827 --> 02:00:29.948]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:35.210 --> 02:00:37.871]  Well, we just got Ray McGovern's perspective.
[02:00:41.704 --> 02:00:44.126]  What's happening in the Middle East with Syria?
[02:00:44.146 --> 02:00:47.669]  All I know is, I don't look at the world in a Machiavellian way.
[02:00:49.230 --> 02:00:51.112]  That's what ends up wrecking societies.
[02:00:51.472 --> 02:00:53.273]  It works for a while, but it's cheating.
[02:00:54.074 --> 02:00:58.578]  Of playing groups off against each other, and bringing somebody down so you're bigger.
[02:01:03.422 --> 02:01:08.286]  Sure, if somebody attacks you first, then you have a right to defend yourself.
[02:01:09.321 --> 02:01:14.745]  And if Syria really ever attacked Israel, well then Israel could take out that government, but they're not!
[02:01:15.646 --> 02:01:21.430]  That's a government modernizing and trying to work with people just like Qaddafi and just like Egypt?
[02:01:23.231 --> 02:01:24.752]  Egypt was best buddies with Israel!
[02:01:26.233 --> 02:01:33.699]  And then the federal government and the State Department went in there and tried to finance
[02:01:35.202 --> 02:01:37.303]  The takeover by the radical Muslims in that area.
[02:01:37.783 --> 02:01:39.864]  And I agree with Ray McGovern on a lot of what he was saying.
[02:01:39.884 --> 02:01:46.046]  You know, I'm out of time with him, but I just want to be able to point out that there's more to this than just Israel.
[02:01:46.846 --> 02:01:54.589]  And, you know, the numbskulls out there that just obsess over Israel all day and claim that I, you know, am like covering up for Israel.
[02:01:55.049 --> 02:01:56.990]  I had Ray McGovern on to say all that.
[02:01:58.812 --> 02:02:00.253]  I'm against the Syrian war.
[02:02:00.293 --> 02:02:03.036]  We're breaking the big news stories that have helped stop it.
[02:02:03.076 --> 02:02:04.077]  We're a big part of this.
[02:02:04.557 --> 02:02:05.158]  Recognized.
[02:02:07.039 --> 02:02:13.024]  But I think it's important to also look at all the other interests.
[02:02:13.084 --> 02:02:22.973]  It's like if there's nine guys that rob a bank, and everybody dislikes one particular bank robber more, are we going to not look at the other eight bank robbers?
[02:02:23.493 --> 02:02:25.295]  I mean, if Israel disappeared tomorrow,
[02:02:27.901 --> 02:02:31.062]  You're still going to have Saudi Arabia funding Al Qaeda to take over the Middle East.
[02:02:33.202 --> 02:02:38.724]  You're still going to have a federal government that is going to let Al Qaeda come in and attack us so they can grandstand and take our rights.
[02:02:38.744 --> 02:02:39.484]  Do you understand that?
[02:02:41.144 --> 02:02:44.145]  The communist Chinese are over there in China doing horrible stuff.
[02:02:44.165 --> 02:02:45.406]  They don't need any help from Israel.
[02:02:47.586 --> 02:02:50.507]  All these other groups, I mean, humans just do the same stuff.
[02:02:52.566 --> 02:02:56.847]  And I oppose tyranny, regardless of where it comes from, and I have the moral high ground.
[02:02:57.207 --> 02:03:03.929]  And the reason I harp on this is you see how they use political correctness, balkanization, division, as a way to control us all.
[02:03:04.589 --> 02:03:09.330]  So that we're, well I'm an Israeli, well I'm a Syrian, well I'm a German, I'm an American, I'm a whatever.
[02:03:10.510 --> 02:03:14.351]  Well I don't, you know, I'm a Sunni, so I'm going to support the takeover of Syria.
[02:03:17.861 --> 02:03:25.727]  Because it's a secular government, made up of a coalition of Sunnis, Shiites, Alawites, Jews, Christians, you name it.
[02:03:25.747 --> 02:03:43.940]  And so you're going to start a war, a civil war, bring troops in, wreck them, stage chemical attacks, try to give half the country to Al Qaeda, and the other half to a collection of other groups, wreck it, give Turkey a slice,
[02:03:44.997 --> 02:03:48.698]  Give Israel a slice and then break what's left up in a couple pieces.
[02:03:48.758 --> 02:03:52.419]  I mean, that's outrageously immoral and wrong.
[02:03:53.159 --> 02:03:55.859]  And if the ADL wants to say I'm anti-Semitic, go ahead.
[02:03:55.899 --> 02:03:58.120]  I mean, it's a crazy land.
[02:03:59.220 --> 02:04:02.721]  And I think that's what the American people have finally come to the point of.
[02:04:03.821 --> 02:04:09.162]  But at the same time, the frustration is that there's more parties to this.
[02:04:10.718 --> 02:04:16.463]  And if we just sit there and always blame Israel for everything, it becomes a cop-out, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:04:18.285 --> 02:04:24.911]  Just like black folks that don't want to go get a job blaming on white people, or white folks that don't want to go get a job blaming on Mexicans.
[02:04:24.971 --> 02:04:27.072]  I mean, you hear it all, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:04:30.546 --> 02:04:49.892]  The world is really a complex situation, and I'm trying to put out a nuanced thought process that I've studied from history that can really bring us together and unify us around private property, family, due process, and honoring science and technology and uplifting the human spirit and beauty and art.
[02:04:50.893 --> 02:04:52.793]  And that's really what I support.
[02:04:53.433 --> 02:04:54.494]  I'm a fan of humanity.
[02:04:55.618 --> 02:04:58.923]  I'm a fan of our potential, and I want to see everybody live in peace.
[02:04:59.024 --> 02:05:02.850]  Black, white, Jewish, German, Chinese, Latin American.
[02:05:04.352 --> 02:05:06.896]  I want to see real freedom.
[02:05:09.366 --> 02:05:14.270]  The world is discovering the power of medicinal silver to fight against life-threatening pathogens.
[02:05:14.871 --> 02:05:18.134]  And as a result, dozens of silver solutions have emerged.
[02:05:18.694 --> 02:05:21.576]  You can even make your own colloidal silver at home in your garage.
[02:05:22.117 --> 02:05:24.939]  How do you know which solution is the safest and most effective?
[02:05:25.580 --> 02:05:31.605]  Supernatural Silver is a new patented technology that is made using 10,000 volts of AC current.
[02:05:32.186 --> 02:05:35.629]  This technology is so powerful, it must be made in a laboratory.
[02:05:36.269 --> 02:05:46.955]  Colloidal and ionic silvers use a charge of only 110 volts of DC current, making supernatural silver hundreds of times more effective against viruses, bacteria, and fungus.
[02:05:47.675 --> 02:05:52.618]  Supernatural silver liquid can be used internally, and our silver gel can be used topically.
[02:05:53.158 --> 02:06:01.030]  To find out more information on how Supernatural Silver can help you win the war against deadly pathogens, go to SupernaturalSilver.com.

[02:08:23.525 --> 02:08:25.367]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:30.610 --> 02:08:32.251]  Breaking up on Infowars.com.
[02:08:32.351 --> 02:08:39.015]  DHS to test face scanning cameras at Tri-City Hockey Game.
[02:08:39.855 --> 02:08:42.517]  That's up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:08:43.037 --> 02:08:47.380]  Leader of Syrian rebel group calls for attacks inside the U.S.
[02:08:48.700 --> 02:08:51.802]  That's, by the way, in Reuters and London Telegraph.
[02:08:52.182 --> 02:09:01.327]  But we go forward to point out he just so also happens to be the head of Al-Qaeda being armed by NATO out of Jordan.
[02:09:02.147 --> 02:09:02.627]  On record.
[02:09:03.508 --> 02:09:05.049]  That's how dumb they think you are.
[02:09:05.851 --> 02:09:08.172]  They launch the attacks, they run Al Qaeda.
[02:09:08.732 --> 02:09:11.934]  They are the criminal, occupational government that runs this country.
[02:09:12.314 --> 02:09:20.537]  And they are a consortium of corporate boards, we really study it, that meet at the North American Union meetings that have been leaked and declassified.
[02:09:21.318 --> 02:09:30.342]  And you'll have all these different interests, the leaders of each country, a bunch of corporate heads, it's like Bilderberg or Davos, and they sit there and decide what they're going to do.
[02:09:32.045 --> 02:09:35.108]  The problem is, our own military said they won't follow the orders.
[02:09:35.688 --> 02:09:41.654]  Even General Dempsey, who I've been critical of, it's been confirmed, told Obama, this is insane.
[02:09:42.434 --> 02:09:44.336]  We have intel the Russians are going to fight us.
[02:09:44.456 --> 02:09:45.917]  You ready to start World War III, bud?
[02:09:45.937 --> 02:09:50.281]  Because the military all knows they're arming Al Qaeda.
[02:09:50.321 --> 02:09:51.202]  They followed those orders.
[02:09:52.063 --> 02:09:54.825]  They all know they're murdering the Christians en masse, and two million have fled.
[02:09:55.886 --> 02:09:56.306]  Look it up.
[02:09:56.387 --> 02:09:57.608]  Two million have fled Syria.
[02:09:57.928 --> 02:09:58.869]  That's Associated Press.
[02:10:00.290 --> 02:10:00.990]  Mainly Christians.
[02:10:01.130 --> 02:10:01.710]  And they're smart.
[02:10:02.010 --> 02:10:03.051]  They'll get their heads chopped off.
[02:10:03.951 --> 02:10:05.291]  Turkey's trying to not let them get out.
[02:10:05.351 --> 02:10:06.572]  Georgia's trying to not let them get out.
[02:10:06.692 --> 02:10:07.992]  Israel's trying to not let them get out.
[02:10:08.012 --> 02:10:09.392]  I mean, that is vicious.
[02:10:10.332 --> 02:10:13.253]  And Christian churches all across this country won't even criticize it.
[02:10:13.993 --> 02:10:20.355]  Because if Christians need to have their heads cut off by Al-Qaeda so we can have the Sunnis and Shiites kill each other, well, that's just the way it is.
[02:10:21.195 --> 02:10:23.536]  It is unbelievably immoral.
[02:10:26.416 --> 02:10:28.877]  But here's this article out of Live Science
[02:10:30.430 --> 02:10:42.217]  Drivers identities verified by brainwaves and auto companies are moving towards a brainwave biometric fingerprint to open and start your car.
[02:10:42.777 --> 02:10:48.581]  You think thumbprinting and the new iPhones where they're going to stop?
[02:10:48.661 --> 02:10:55.285]  In 2002 at five US airports, this was CBS News, they were testing passive MRI brain scanners.
[02:10:55.998 --> 02:10:57.661]  Do you have any idea how powerful that is?
[02:10:58.622 --> 02:11:02.148]  Passive MRI brain scanners were already in the airports.
[02:11:02.228 --> 02:11:04.652]  I mean, that's why the elite are on such power trips.
[02:11:05.012 --> 02:11:08.278]  They've already GMO'd all the food to manipulate our genetics on record.
[02:11:10.194 --> 02:11:11.615]  They've got to get control of the world.
[02:11:11.635 --> 02:11:13.136]  They can't have any country you can run to.
[02:11:13.216 --> 02:11:14.457]  Russia, Syria, any of it.
[02:11:14.677 --> 02:11:19.960]  Whether those countries are good or bad, because it's world government, folks, and you've got to be inoculated.
[02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:21.421]  You've got to be fluoridated.
[02:11:21.461 --> 02:11:26.725]  You've got to be soft-killed so you're weak and diseased and poisoned ahead of their master plan.
[02:11:28.586 --> 02:11:35.050]  Before I get to the attack on the press, I want to show TV viewers, radio listeners can just go to these headlines.
[02:11:36.491 --> 02:11:37.652]  This is from the Daily Mail.
[02:11:39.580 --> 02:11:44.181]  It is also in CNET News, that's CBS News, puts that out.
[02:11:45.421 --> 02:11:53.383]  And it's also in an article we did before all of them back in July on PrisonPlanet.com by Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:11:53.703 --> 02:11:56.004]  Professor, robots to patrol cities by 2040.
[02:11:56.464 --> 02:11:58.024]  What are these headlines that came out today?
[02:11:58.344 --> 02:12:00.985]  Killer robots and crippling cyber attacks.
[02:12:01.385 --> 02:12:05.946]  How the world is going to end according to super brains such as Stephen Hawking, the physicist
[02:12:07.717 --> 02:12:09.699]  An extremely accurate futurist.
[02:12:10.520 --> 02:12:13.843]  And then it goes into other top futurists saying the exact same thing.
[02:12:13.863 --> 02:12:14.944]  See, we've interviewed them.
[02:12:15.024 --> 02:12:16.305]  We've read their white papers.
[02:12:16.605 --> 02:12:17.746]  I concur with their analysis.
[02:12:18.827 --> 02:12:25.353]  We've probably interviewed, I don't know, let's not exaggerate, 30 or 40 of these futurist top ones over the years here on this show.
[02:12:25.373 --> 02:12:29.877]  In fact, we interviewed one of the top robotics experts that works with Kurzweil last night on the Nightly News.
[02:12:32.139 --> 02:12:33.059]  Roman Jompolski.
[02:12:34.167 --> 02:12:38.130]  Now, we cover this, and what does the White House do to us?
[02:12:38.610 --> 02:12:39.531]  White House responded.
[02:12:40.192 --> 02:12:41.032]  They're very upset.
[02:12:42.133 --> 02:13:01.688]  They've taken out of context what I said, sandwiches together, and again, media matters doesn't matter, except that when they put something out, then Raw Story, Salon, all the other big fascists, I'm not just saying they are fascists, I mean, I saw a salon on CNN last night promoting the war and how wonderful it was.
[02:13:01.748 --> 02:13:02.649]  I mean, it's just sick.
[02:13:04.986 --> 02:13:05.646]  One of their writers.
[02:13:07.728 --> 02:13:09.489]  But because they talk with a lisp, it's okay.
[02:13:09.549 --> 02:13:10.350]  I don't understand that.
[02:13:10.390 --> 02:13:14.213]  It's like, it says, here's a raw story following the White House directive.
[02:13:14.673 --> 02:13:20.078]  Syrian diplomacy, a plot to extinguish humans so Obama and elitists can be cyborgs.
[02:13:21.906 --> 02:13:25.447]  And it got picked up, again, by a bunch of other publications.
[02:13:25.487 --> 02:13:27.348]  First, it came out from the White House run.
[02:13:27.368 --> 02:13:31.089]  I mean, a notepad's not a big deal either, but it gets picked up.
[02:13:31.129 --> 02:13:33.309]  That's why it's important is to see the propaganda.
[02:13:33.889 --> 02:13:39.691]  Alex Jones links Syrian weapons proposal to human extinction plot.
[02:13:40.754 --> 02:13:47.200]  Jones, globalist theory connects weapons inspectors to plans for replacing humans with new species of human-machine hybrids.
[02:13:47.520 --> 02:13:49.723]  I was just going off what they openly say.
[02:13:49.763 --> 02:13:51.724]  Now, I just showed you Stephen Hawking.
[02:13:51.744 --> 02:13:55.528]  He gets into all that and says that will result in a giant robot war and kill everybody.
[02:13:56.329 --> 02:14:02.775]  Of course, I was quoting all those guys yesterday, too, in that full breakdown, but they can take that, try to make it sound weird.
[02:14:03.716 --> 02:14:05.478]  This is the same government-run media
[02:14:06.437 --> 02:14:11.004]  That tells you that the northern and southern ice caps are the smallest ever recorded.
[02:14:13.028 --> 02:14:19.338]  Ladies and gentlemen, NASA admits that it is the largest recorded since they had satellites in the 1950s.
[02:14:21.527 --> 02:14:23.568]  You can go to the Daily Mail, you can go to NASA.
[02:14:23.708 --> 02:14:24.689]  Here it is, right here.
[02:14:24.709 --> 02:14:30.953]  It shows the August 2012 ice cap, the August 2013 ice cap.
[02:14:31.814 --> 02:14:42.922]  This is the earliest closing in a very long time of the Northern Passage, where ships are normally able to go, even into October or so, through there.
[02:14:42.982 --> 02:14:44.963]  By August, it was already frozen shut.
[02:14:45.804 --> 02:14:48.045]  We're only the biggest icebreakers who go through the southern areas.
[02:14:49.585 --> 02:14:52.146]  Now again, folks, this is how they lie to you.
[02:14:52.166 --> 02:14:54.047]  Because I played it a few weeks ago.
[02:14:54.107 --> 02:14:54.648]  We have the clip.
[02:14:54.968 --> 02:14:57.049]  CNN said the ice caps are the smallest ever.
[02:14:57.249 --> 02:14:58.249]  The polar bears are all dying.
[02:14:58.970 --> 02:15:00.450]  Now, the polar bear numbers are up fivefold.
[02:15:00.470 --> 02:15:01.051]  Just look that up.
[02:15:01.531 --> 02:15:03.232]  Just type in polar bear numbers explode.
[02:15:03.252 --> 02:15:03.872]  It's all on record.
[02:15:05.213 --> 02:15:08.054]  They've exploded five times in Northern Europe where they checked them.
[02:15:08.695 --> 02:15:10.255]  I think they said four times in Russia.
[02:15:10.295 --> 02:15:14.998]  And they admit in some areas, as much as ten times in North America, they don't have an actual number.
[02:15:15.458 --> 02:15:16.939]  They're all over the place.
[02:15:20.563 --> 02:15:24.764]  That's because they restrict hunting of them a lot now, so they're running around like roaches, basically.
[02:15:24.804 --> 02:15:29.284]  I think it's a beautiful, cool animal, but, you know, now the new thing is, well, some are starving.
[02:15:29.304 --> 02:15:32.505]  Well, some have always starved, so the strongest survive.
[02:15:33.105 --> 02:15:33.905]  That's how this works.
[02:15:35.245 --> 02:15:39.066]  But see, they don't want us to be able to be on air and point all of this out.
[02:15:40.386 --> 02:15:45.767]  They don't want us on air pointing all the things that are being put into place here.
[02:15:48.488 --> 02:15:49.388]  They don't want
[02:15:50.484 --> 02:15:55.045]  The American people, the people of the world, ever get into reality.
[02:15:56.005 --> 02:15:57.326]  And by the way, the public's smart.
[02:15:57.366 --> 02:16:00.506]  People can learn all about every automobile and big collectors.
[02:16:00.546 --> 02:16:05.248]  They can learn about every conceivable thing that you can imagine.
[02:16:06.248 --> 02:16:08.748]  Baseball scores, you name it.
[02:16:09.789 --> 02:16:12.789]  But they can't learn about the ice sheets.
[02:16:13.389 --> 02:16:15.830]  They can't learn about forms of government.
[02:16:16.350 --> 02:16:17.650]  Because, oh, that's boring.
[02:16:18.371 --> 02:16:19.371]  They make it boring.
[02:16:20.455 --> 02:16:23.697]  I'm at the former head of the Department of Education on about this, the head of policy.
[02:16:24.117 --> 02:16:35.144]  They were there in the 80s saying, we're here to make this boring, we're here to dumb it down so that people never get the bug to learn and become creative.
[02:16:35.805 --> 02:16:36.345]  And they've done it.
[02:16:37.245 --> 02:16:39.207]  They've got a bunch of unimaginative people
[02:16:40.285 --> 02:16:46.411]  Who don't care about any of this, and so now they're demonizing anybody that points out what's really going on.
[02:16:46.811 --> 02:16:58.042]  You know, I say I'm glad that they're going to give up their WMDs so this war doesn't happen, but see that still is damned of you, damned of you don't, because it sets the precedent where
[02:16:59.298 --> 02:17:23.704]  Then the West says you've got to give your weapons up that are legal and then they can come in and take everybody else's weapons on earth until only the globalists have the weapons and then they can come in and take over your country anyways when you don't have the weapons like Iraq and that's part of the global government plan is to bring in the drones and bring in the automation so that then the military can't refuse the orders to attack
[02:17:24.804 --> 02:17:30.209]  And the elite are delusional and believe they're going to merge with machines and live forever, and then I can quote Ray Kurzweil in all of them.
[02:17:31.751 --> 02:17:40.880]  And then they come out and say, Alex Jones made this up, not Alex Jones showed you the megalomaniacal power-tripping delusion.
[02:17:41.120 --> 02:17:48.027]  You know, I told you they were going to try to bring a fairness doctrine to the internet, and that they were going to
[02:17:49.864 --> 02:17:52.665]  Uh, come in and try to restrict free speech.
[02:17:52.705 --> 02:17:57.627]  And I actually have a stack of news on that that I haven't even gotten to yet.
[02:17:58.808 --> 02:18:05.150]  Um, the announcement has been made, uh, that Verizon and others are saying the internet is going to be pay as you go.
[02:18:05.550 --> 02:18:06.411]  Well, that's agenda.
[02:18:07.503 --> 02:18:11.006]  For Internet 2 always is to phase out the old web and basically make it a toll road.
[02:18:11.086 --> 02:18:14.729]  You already paid for it over and over again with your connection and the rest of it.
[02:18:14.809 --> 02:18:18.172]  It's about the power structure grabbing it and making it a monopoly.
[02:18:18.432 --> 02:18:19.513]  That's what they always do.
[02:18:19.533 --> 02:18:36.688]  And that's Dianne Feinstein's gotten the bill passed out of the Senate committee to basically start going after and taxing and regulating and not letting you have journalistic sources, getting rid of the First Amendment for people that are not federally certified.
[02:18:38.373 --> 02:18:44.356]  And now they're announcing, oh, Federal Consumer Protection Bureau to monitor 80% of all credit card transactions.
[02:18:44.376 --> 02:18:46.458]  See, they're mainlining NSA spying.
[02:18:46.658 --> 02:18:47.578]  They're already doing that.
[02:18:47.798 --> 02:18:50.960]  But they're like, oh, now we're going to monitor all your credit card stuff for your safety.
[02:18:51.981 --> 02:18:53.842]  Now it's going to be the government contacting you.
[02:18:53.862 --> 02:19:02.507]  Now it's going to be the government contacting you, not the bank about every time I go out of town.
[02:19:04.366 --> 02:19:06.087]  And I bought dinner somewhere or a hotel.
[02:19:06.107 --> 02:19:08.830]  All of a sudden I go to buy and my credit card's turned off.
[02:19:08.890 --> 02:19:09.750]  They go, sir, sorry.
[02:19:10.111 --> 02:19:17.617]  So I take like three so that as the credit cards are turned off, I can go to the next one and then call the bank and give them 18 codes and all the rest of it.
[02:19:18.317 --> 02:19:20.159]  And then they're going to say, oh, biometrics is the answer.
[02:19:20.199 --> 02:19:24.322]  Oh, brain scanning's the answer to activate your... That's being announced, by the way.
[02:19:25.520 --> 02:19:27.301]  They'll probably have another White House written article.
[02:19:27.381 --> 02:19:30.742]  Jones claims they'll brain scan you to use your credit card.
[02:19:30.842 --> 02:19:34.183]  No, they'll just brain scan you and connect it to your bank account.
[02:19:34.663 --> 02:19:44.346]  And then once it's all tied to you, they can totally control everything you do, or you'll be blackballed from not being able to buy or sell, and that's the announcement they're making.
[02:19:44.686 --> 02:19:45.826]  Oh, haven't paid the IRS?
[02:19:46.086 --> 02:19:47.227]  You can't leave the U.S.
[02:19:47.287 --> 02:19:48.187]  They're trying to pass a bill.
[02:19:49.488 --> 02:19:50.389]  No judge, no jury.
[02:19:50.930 --> 02:19:55.214]  Now they're saying, by the way, we want the bill where you can't travel outside your state.
[02:19:55.795 --> 02:19:59.839]  And we're going to have checkpoints like the border to leave your state.
[02:19:59.859 --> 02:20:07.908]  And we could always find more guys that, you know, were security at concerts to be cops who will treat you and your family.
[02:20:09.360 --> 02:20:12.842]  For over five years, you've been hearing about the Berkey guy.
[02:20:13.162 --> 02:20:14.983]  So you may know a few things about him.
[02:20:15.264 --> 02:20:21.508]  For example, you are well aware of the superior quality and effectiveness of Berkey water filters and accessories.
[02:20:21.948 --> 02:20:27.211]  But did you know the Berkeys have had independent lab tests done to prove just how effective they are?
[02:20:27.551 --> 02:20:30.093]  It's true, and he can email you the test results.
[02:20:30.413 --> 02:20:32.334]  Just visit GoBerky.com.

[02:21:09.195 --> 02:21:10.036]  Gold isn't for you?
[02:21:10.216 --> 02:21:15.539]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[02:21:15.719 --> 02:21:16.160]  I get it.
[02:21:16.280 --> 02:21:25.586]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[02:21:25.866 --> 02:21:27.027]  That's not what's happening.
[02:21:27.267 --> 02:21:35.472]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[02:21:35.712 --> 02:21:38.974]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[02:21:39.094 --> 02:21:43.156]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[02:21:43.337 --> 02:21:44.337]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[02:21:44.937 --> 02:21:48.159]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[02:21:48.339 --> 02:21:52.482]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[02:21:52.662 --> 02:21:53.403]  You should, too.
[02:21:53.583 --> 02:21:54.544]  Find out what they know.

[02:23:07.725 --> 02:23:12.308]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[02:23:12.448 --> 02:23:15.390]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[02:23:15.550 --> 02:23:20.794]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[02:23:21.114 --> 02:23:22.715]  It all comes down to one thing.
[02:23:23.035 --> 02:23:24.355]  We are what we eat.
[02:23:24.675 --> 02:23:28.996]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[02:23:29.336 --> 02:23:33.317]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and Big Pharma runoff.
[02:23:33.557 --> 02:23:35.858]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[02:23:36.098 --> 02:23:42.019]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[02:24:24.349 --> 02:24:35.159]  Keith Hudson, father of Katy Perry, minister and author of the new book, Looking and Seeing, a book about teaching you to learn how to look beyond your present situation and keep your eye on the prize.
[02:24:35.659 --> 02:24:47.730]  God is ready to display his glory in your life as well as in these last days, but it is going to take boldness for you to take the mask off and look at the people and situations the way God sees them, not the way man looks at them.
[02:24:47.870 --> 02:24:51.012]  We're going to talk about the corruption of youth through media.
[02:24:51.934 --> 02:24:58.879]  And of course with all the corruption of Miley Cyrus and the rest of it, we're not going to talk a bunch about his daughter here today.
[02:24:58.999 --> 02:25:04.803]  I wanted to get him on because I heard he was a listener from, I think it was Dave Mustaine told me, but the point is we contacted him, he was a listener.
[02:25:05.363 --> 02:25:08.926]  And I've read the book now, it's a short little book, very interesting, very informative.
[02:25:09.486 --> 02:25:11.608]  I wanted to get him on, he's on the road via cell phone.
[02:25:12.964 --> 02:25:19.607]  From his perspective to talk about why the system he thinks is targeting the youth.
[02:25:21.308 --> 02:25:26.211]  But specifically, sir, we didn't get you on about your daughter, but that'll be a big point of interest if I don't get it out of the way.
[02:25:26.751 --> 02:25:33.635]  There's been a lot of stuff in the media, just to get it out of the way, that people brought up saying that you said about your daughter that you didn't say.
[02:25:33.675 --> 02:25:41.799]  So I'd like to give you a chance to clear that up, but then give your take in general about the youth and what we see happening in society, sir.
[02:25:43.188 --> 02:25:47.072]  Hey Alex, hey, thank you so much for allowing me to be on.
[02:25:47.112 --> 02:25:48.974]  I really count it a privilege, honor.
[02:25:49.194 --> 02:25:51.957]  Listen, I mean, I've been listening.
[02:25:52.017 --> 02:25:57.182]  Somebody told me about two years ago, they said, you gotta hear this guy, Alex Jones.
[02:25:58.064 --> 02:26:03.268]  And they said this to me, he says, he tells the truth about what's really happening.
[02:26:03.729 --> 02:26:11.335]  And the minute I heard that, the word truth, because I'm a Christian and I read the Bible, the Bible says you should know the truth and the truth will make you free.
[02:26:11.355 --> 02:26:12.716]  So I said, well, I better hook it up.
[02:26:13.296 --> 02:26:14.978]  And then after that, it was history.
[02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:19.884]  Listening to you, I listen to you almost every day.
[02:26:19.904 --> 02:26:26.952]  I just say to your listeners, if you're a Christian, you should listen to this program because you really do.
[02:26:26.972 --> 02:26:30.897]  I appreciate, you know, you're out there like we all are out there.
[02:26:30.917 --> 02:26:32.238]  Of course, you know, we're in the public.
[02:26:33.251 --> 02:26:42.653]  We get blasted for a lot of things that we say that we said that we'd never said or where they picked that up from.
[02:26:42.693 --> 02:26:55.776]  But I commend you, Alex, and I don't even feel I'm capable to do this program because you've had so many incredible, I mean, incredible people of magnitude.
[02:26:55.816 --> 02:26:58.077]  I feel like a hot dog in a steak factory.
[02:26:59.150 --> 02:27:00.071]  That's not true.
[02:27:00.531 --> 02:27:01.211]  Are you kidding?
[02:27:01.231 --> 02:27:02.512]  You know, I read your book.
[02:27:02.832 --> 02:27:04.894]  Well, we got it a few days ago, and it's a great read.
[02:27:04.934 --> 02:27:07.195]  I agree with so much of it.
[02:27:07.255 --> 02:27:09.556]  It's really spot on from my humble perspective.
[02:27:10.537 --> 02:27:18.021]  But I'm interested because I've got two daughters and a son, and they're great, but they're firecrackers of what they're going to do.
[02:27:18.041 --> 02:27:23.144]  You know, I think of the stuff I did when I was younger, and I'm a totally different person now than I was then.
[02:27:23.165 --> 02:27:23.965]  I was pretty bad.
[02:27:24.565 --> 02:27:28.087]  In fact, I was probably a lot worse than a lot of people you see in rock and roll and stuff on TV.
[02:27:29.428 --> 02:27:30.028]  Join the crowd.
[02:27:30.188 --> 02:27:38.991]  I think you're uniquely authorized to be in a perspective to be able to write a book about the youth today.
[02:27:40.192 --> 02:27:44.073]  Yeah, you know, too, because my daughter has given us a platform.
[02:27:44.153 --> 02:27:46.213]  I just let people know we don't use our daughter.
[02:27:46.253 --> 02:27:47.574]  I have great relationship.
[02:27:47.654 --> 02:27:49.494]  I believe family first.
[02:27:50.435 --> 02:27:57.237]  I've been in the ministry 41 years and family has always been first and we protect each other.
[02:27:57.997 --> 02:28:02.560]  And we take time off for each other, even if our schedules are really busy.
[02:28:03.461 --> 02:28:07.743]  We spend all our vacation, our Thanksgiving, Christmas, and all those.
[02:28:07.783 --> 02:28:15.488]  And we, because I really believe, you know, when the lights are off and the music is over and everybody's gone, the only thing you have is your family.
[02:28:16.306 --> 02:28:21.675]  And we need to really protect our family and you know, my daughter's out there.
[02:28:21.735 --> 02:28:29.548]  She's born it big and wide and I mean, you know, but I have been given a platform for the youth and I'm a little different.
[02:28:29.588 --> 02:28:30.148]  I'm not sure.
[02:28:31.354 --> 02:28:33.295]  She would say you're old school type preacher.
[02:28:33.315 --> 02:28:38.798]  You know, I'm, I, you know, I look at, I've seen things a lot different.
[02:28:38.838 --> 02:28:44.261]  This generation is not looking for the church Jesus or a religious Jesus.
[02:28:44.721 --> 02:28:46.182]  They just want the real Jesus.
[02:28:46.962 --> 02:28:50.304]  And I share that with people and I get the opportunity God's given us.
[02:28:51.556 --> 02:28:52.297]  We're good to go.
[02:29:11.270 --> 02:29:12.131]  I think so.
[02:29:30.471 --> 02:29:36.156]  This generation in such a great way, and they're listening.
[02:29:36.677 --> 02:29:37.557]  Well, they certainly are.
[02:29:37.618 --> 02:29:38.879]  Keith Hudson, stay there.
[02:29:38.959 --> 02:29:40.220]  KeithHudson.com.
[02:29:40.660 --> 02:29:42.262]  The book, Looking and Seeing.
[02:29:43.402 --> 02:29:48.387]  I want to talk about what God sees versus what people that are in the world see.
[02:29:48.447 --> 02:29:56.414]  I want to get the gist of that with you on the other side and how we try to turn the youth around in this country straight ahead.
[02:29:58.257 --> 02:30:01.241]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:30:02.183 --> 02:30:04.866]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:09.502 --> 02:30:12.283]  Protecting your home with a security system is a must.
[02:30:12.503 --> 02:30:18.525]  But when it comes to protecting your family, your home and belongings, there's no need to sign a long-term contract.
[02:30:18.865 --> 02:30:25.288]  Listen, there is some real scum in the alarm business cashing in by locking you into long, punishing contracts.
[02:30:25.668 --> 02:30:27.628]  Not with SimpliSafe Home Security.
[02:30:27.949 --> 02:30:29.009]  They're the good guys.

[02:31:13.283 --> 02:31:14.203]  Tyranny is here.
[02:31:14.543 --> 02:31:18.064]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:31:18.464 --> 02:31:20.684]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:31:20.864 --> 02:31:26.145]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:31:26.565 --> 02:31:32.826]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:31:33.226 --> 02:31:38.807]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:31:39.207 --> 02:31:42.888]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[02:31:43.388 --> 02:31:47.370]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:31:47.670 --> 02:31:53.172]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:31:53.612 --> 02:31:56.553]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:31:57.173 --> 02:31:58.534]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:31:59.154 --> 02:31:59.654]  It's here.

[02:32:09.511 --> 02:32:11.573]  It's hurricane and wildfire season again.
[02:32:11.594 --> 02:32:19.182]  Why do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year, betting their lives that the disaster won't get them?
[02:32:19.623 --> 02:32:24.288]  Hundreds of you helped eFoodsDirect ship 50,000 donated meals to the Oklahoma victims.
[02:32:24.568 --> 02:32:26.491]  The problem is we can't help everybody.
[02:32:26.751 --> 02:32:28.273]  If every one of us who can...
[02:32:28.613 --> 02:32:29.854]  We'll take care of ourselves.
[02:32:30.114 --> 02:32:32.856]  We can all pitch in to take care of those who really can't.
[02:32:33.136 --> 02:32:40.941]  The new Just-In-Case Pack from eFoods Direct is the big brother to the 7-Day Emergency Pack designed for Oklahoma disaster donations.

[02:33:13.450 --> 02:33:16.973]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:33:17.513 --> 02:33:19.355]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:22.937 --> 02:33:25.299]  Well, we've got Keith Hudson on with us.
[02:33:25.319 --> 02:33:28.562]  Looking and Seeing is the book, available at KeithHudson.com.
[02:33:29.182 --> 02:33:32.225]  Katy Perry's father calls her a devil child in sermon report.
[02:33:36.107 --> 02:33:40.468]  That was put out by the New York Daily News with no proof, no video.
[02:33:40.848 --> 02:33:58.533]  I want to give you the opportunity again here on air to explain that you didn't say that and then what your view overall just of rock and roll and where it's all going and Miley Cyrus and all the rest of it and then we're going to shift gears into overall where you think the state of the world is today, sir.
[02:33:59.881 --> 02:34:13.427]  Well, Alex, that statement that came out about a month and a half, two months ago, I guess, and they said that I made the statement I called my daughter a devil child, which is not true, and I would never do that.
[02:34:13.807 --> 02:34:18.289]  Like I said in the beginning of this talking there, that my family's first.
[02:34:18.369 --> 02:34:19.310]  It's always been first.
[02:34:19.430 --> 02:34:23.031]  Never ministry, never work, and I believe we have to really realize that.
[02:34:23.051 --> 02:34:24.712]  The only thing we do have is our family.
[02:34:25.462 --> 02:34:26.662]  And they're most important.
[02:34:27.042 --> 02:34:31.904]  And I know there's a lot of things that have been put out there on me.
[02:34:32.104 --> 02:34:36.625]  Not a lot, but like stuff on you that put out there that you said you didn't say.
[02:34:36.645 --> 02:34:40.846]  But I can tell you for a fact, I did not ever say there's no proof.
[02:34:41.126 --> 02:34:44.067]  There's nothing on video, nothing on the
[02:34:45.512 --> 02:34:47.893]  You know, on the tapes or anything?
[02:34:47.973 --> 02:34:55.017]  Sure, well MSNBC says that I'm a deeply racist and can't show one clip of me saying anything racist.
[02:34:55.057 --> 02:35:03.421]  My lawyer said I could definitely win in court but then I'd spend years probably beating them and tons of money and you know they're so discredited that's just the way it is.
[02:35:03.501 --> 02:35:06.343]  But specifically, obviously I think
[02:35:06.943 --> 02:35:15.031]  God is going to use some of the trials and tribulations that people's children have, you know, to help them learn more, but also you have the prodigal son.
[02:35:15.051 --> 02:35:23.459]  I mean, I think of all the rock and roll out there that's so popular, your daughter's pretty tame compared to some of the stuff that other people are involved in.
[02:35:23.499 --> 02:35:29.945]  But specifically, because I have daughters, and I want to understand this from you, who are a lot younger, you know, five and nine, you know,
[02:35:30.225 --> 02:35:44.497]  You raise somebody Christian, they're a very successful singer as a Christian, and then obviously, you know, the big, powerful, worldly stuff comes in, and who can refuse when they're 18 years old or whatever, and then she gets married to Russell Brand, who I think's waking up and is a good guy overall.
[02:35:44.537 --> 02:35:50.923]  You said some stuff off-air to me, you know, nice stuff, and again, we're not judging people is the point.
[02:35:51.803 --> 02:35:52.023]  Right.
[02:35:52.764 --> 02:35:57.548]  Yeah, we, you know, and I, you know, like I said, I support my daughter.
[02:35:57.648 --> 02:36:06.214]  I support, I've got a son and another daughter, and they're just as important to us, to me, as my, as Katie is.
[02:36:06.334 --> 02:36:14.621]  And, you know, I just think, you know, the generation that we're living in, they, you know, they really want to be loved and they want to worship.
[02:36:15.325 --> 02:36:17.987]  But they're running after all these musicians and everything.
[02:36:18.007 --> 02:36:22.990]  And unfortunately, you know, uh, it's the wrong thing to look at.
[02:36:23.650 --> 02:36:26.152]  But, um... That's what I want to get into.
[02:36:26.873 --> 02:36:27.333]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:36:27.353 --> 02:36:28.634]  Go ahead, go ahead.
[02:36:28.934 --> 02:36:29.214]  No, no.
[02:36:29.234 --> 02:36:30.655]  I'm just... Go ahead.
[02:36:31.035 --> 02:36:31.556]  No, you go ahead.
[02:36:33.007 --> 02:36:38.570]  Well, you know, it's very unique out there because, you know, we travel all over the world.
[02:36:38.630 --> 02:36:42.651]  This is our 41st year full-time in the ministry.
[02:36:43.072 --> 02:36:47.153]  We go to about eight countries, and then we travel all over the United States.
[02:36:47.173 --> 02:36:52.196]  We're somewhere different, in a different place, different city, a different nation, almost every week.
[02:36:53.462 --> 02:36:58.725]  I get a good perspective of what's taking place in this generation and it's different.
[02:36:59.265 --> 02:37:00.406]  And you know, we have to learn.
[02:37:00.426 --> 02:37:14.413]  In my book, Looking and Seeing, I share that, like you said, we have to start seeing this generation with our heart and not with our eyes and quit judging people because of their tattoos or their earrings or the color of their hair.
[02:37:15.073 --> 02:37:18.375]  I was in the Yippie Movement in the 60s, and you know, we were totally different.
[02:37:18.415 --> 02:37:23.258]  So everybody judges us by our hair, and everybody judges us because of our tie-dye t-shirts and stuff.
[02:37:23.298 --> 02:37:27.541]  But we have to approach people with love, and that's what changes people's lives.
[02:37:28.141 --> 02:37:29.142]  And that's the Gospel.
[02:37:29.242 --> 02:37:36.006]  I mean, I'm a minister, and you know, I get a lot of results because I don't come in with a lot of rules and regulations.
[02:37:36.506 --> 02:37:44.328]  And a lot of stipulations, and a lot of things you can't do, and you can't do this, you can't wear that, you can't go there, and you can't... And it's just, it's not God, period.
[02:37:44.408 --> 02:37:49.590]  Well, all that does is being a Pharisee runs everybody off instead of bringing them in.
[02:37:49.630 --> 02:37:50.570]  Look what Christ did.
[02:37:50.590 --> 02:38:00.493]  The Pharisees were always, you're hanging out with hookers, you're hanging out with tax collectors, you're hanging out with fishmongers, you need to come up here and be with the elite.
[02:38:00.513 --> 02:38:04.794]  And he said, look, you go pray up on the top of the hill and show off and tell us how good you are all day.
[02:38:05.254 --> 02:38:06.995]  All you're doing is running people off.
[02:38:08.015 --> 02:38:08.335]  Right.
[02:38:08.815 --> 02:38:10.996]  That's what I think we've done in the past.
[02:38:11.536 --> 02:38:13.157]  I think it's changing, though.
[02:38:13.197 --> 02:38:21.559]  There's the real change going on, and I think there is, for this generation, there's a hunger to know the real God.
[02:38:21.579 --> 02:38:22.720]  There really is.
[02:38:22.780 --> 02:38:23.160]  There is.
[02:38:23.260 --> 02:38:24.540]  I see that in the young people.
[02:38:25.301 --> 02:38:26.321]  And once they connect,
[02:38:26.923 --> 02:38:32.966]  Man, it's just incredible, the passion and the things that are taking place.
[02:38:32.986 --> 02:38:35.327]  And I'm seeing it all over the world.
[02:38:35.347 --> 02:38:36.788]  I mean, all over.
[02:38:37.728 --> 02:38:39.009]  It's just been incredible.
[02:38:39.861 --> 02:38:44.843]  I want to shift gears to your book, because I have never been obsessed with celebrity.
[02:38:45.163 --> 02:38:54.087]  It's interesting to meet somebody that you admire, someone's book you read that was powerful, or a musician whose music you love, then it's interesting.
[02:38:54.127 --> 02:38:59.749]  But if I don't like your music, if I don't like your films, if I don't like your book, then I could care less.
[02:39:02.347 --> 02:39:02.848]  About you.
[02:39:03.148 --> 02:39:14.421]  And I don't want to say mean things, I don't want to single out artists or filmmakers, but people that are popular but I think is crud, I mean I'd walk to the other side of the street not to meet you because you're probably an egomaniac and that's boring.
[02:39:15.001 --> 02:39:23.451]  And so getting past, kind of like Ashton Kutcher recently said, what's going to fulfill people is not caring about celebrity anymore and realizing that they're fulfilled.
[02:39:23.951 --> 02:39:40.022]  And realizing that there's limited slots out there to be a celebrity, and realizing there's a lot of baggage that comes with being that, and that Madison Avenue has sold the idea that these idols can fulfill you only so they can sell you a product when you're already basically fulfilled.
[02:39:40.042 --> 02:39:47.827]  And I think that's what your book basically says, and you know, you've had a bird's-eye view of it as well, and what it does to people.
[02:39:47.867 --> 02:39:51.930]  Because I know that there's a spirit, and as a pastor, I want to hear what you think this is, sir.
[02:39:52.390 --> 02:39:53.070]  I want to give you the floor.
[02:39:54.111 --> 02:40:01.538]  Well, can I say, too, you know, I've been around a lot of these celebrities, and some of them, I'll be honest with you, they're distasteful.
[02:40:01.558 --> 02:40:03.420]  Like you said, you don't want to be around.
[02:40:03.440 --> 02:40:04.461]  They've got an attitude.
[02:40:04.481 --> 02:40:06.602]  They're so much into themselves.
[02:40:07.243 --> 02:40:11.407]  I can say about my daughter, I believe the reason my daughter is loved
[02:40:12.763 --> 02:40:15.746]  And it's because she really loves people.
[02:40:16.386 --> 02:40:17.167]  She really does.
[02:40:17.227 --> 02:40:21.730]  And I've been still that, my wife and I have been still that in her life since she was a little girl.
[02:40:22.050 --> 02:40:23.592]  And she really cares about people.
[02:40:24.192 --> 02:40:26.394]  And I've always said, keep your feet on the ground.
[02:40:26.834 --> 02:40:33.299]  You know, because, you know... Certainly, I mean, she comes off as a very sweet and passionate person.
[02:40:33.319 --> 02:40:37.843]  I wasn't from the oblique or an obtuse way talking about her.
[02:40:38.063 --> 02:40:39.044]  I'm specifically...
[02:40:39.884 --> 02:40:54.593]  I'm specifically talking about, in the full question, my question for you, Pastor, because I want your insight on this, is there's a spirit, not in the celebrities, but in the general public, who's looking for something, when they can already find, you know, God in their heart.
[02:40:56.154 --> 02:41:00.077]  People are looking and looking and going crazy all around me.
[02:41:01.147 --> 02:41:15.112]  Believing they're going to become celebrities, or they're going to become movie stars, or they're going to become this and that, and there is this crazed spirit of narcissism sweeping the world right now that I really think is a spirit.
[02:41:15.152 --> 02:41:15.832]  What do you say to that?
[02:41:16.758 --> 02:41:25.763]  Well, yeah, I think it's, well, it's the Antichrist spirit, of course, has been released in the earth, and it comes in many different shapes and different forms.
[02:41:26.023 --> 02:41:43.093]  And, you know, the thing about this generation also, I notice, is they're all caught up in the tweeting and Facebook and everything, and to be honest with you, a lot of them, they don't know anything about what's really taking place in the real world.
[02:41:43.726 --> 02:41:55.230]  They just know about their friends, and who's the latest pop singer, the latest song, and they're all into that, but most of them wouldn't even know if Moses came back on the earth, you know what I mean?
[02:41:55.250 --> 02:42:09.835]  I mean, they're just so caught up in the social media of themselves, and the latest ad, and the latest color, and it's crazy, and they, I mean, you ask them, but they know nothing about what's going on in our government, what's behind.
[02:42:10.155 --> 02:42:12.356]  They like the President because he's cool.
[02:42:14.057 --> 02:42:18.241]  You just said it.
[02:42:18.361 --> 02:42:25.768]  It is a projection to cover up reality and get people obsessed with false reality so they can be enslaved.
[02:42:32.694 --> 02:42:38.618]  What do you make of the current state of the world where you've got, where all the sides are being corrupt?
[02:42:38.658 --> 02:42:49.304]  Like, it's wrong that Israel is helping Al-Qaeda attack Serbia, but it's wrong, or helping Al-Qaeda, they did that as well, helping Al-Qaeda attack Syria.
[02:42:49.664 --> 02:42:53.487]  It's wrong that Iran is trying to fund Hezbollah to attack Israel.
[02:42:54.187 --> 02:42:57.289]  It's wrong that NATO's trying to help Al-Qaeda.
[02:42:57.689 --> 02:42:59.590]  I mean, it's just all over the place.
[02:43:00.631 --> 02:43:01.812]  Where are the good guys?
[02:43:02.941 --> 02:43:05.862]  Well, I tell you, there is some good guys, but they're hard to find.
[02:43:05.882 --> 02:43:06.542]  You're one of them.
[02:43:06.562 --> 02:43:08.423]  There's some voices out there.
[02:43:08.463 --> 02:43:11.104]  Paul says in the Scriptures, there's many voices.
[02:43:12.205 --> 02:43:12.745]  But you know what?
[02:43:12.825 --> 02:43:15.166]  You have a voice, and you need to know that.
[02:43:15.246 --> 02:43:25.070]  And I know, you know, I'm coming from me, not very much of nothing, but I'm telling you, you're making an impact upon this nation.
[02:43:25.170 --> 02:43:28.051]  I believe this nation is like a spaceship, of course.
[02:43:29.253 --> 02:43:42.076]  And it's running, I mean, it's crazy, and it's, but too, we have to realize, you know, your listeners are some that maybe don't believe in God, and those are probably a lot of them to do, but it's Bible prophecy.
[02:43:42.136 --> 02:43:56.800]  Things are being set up for this end time, you know, and I can see it all taking place, and I think over the years I've seen it, you know, I've seen Bible prophecy come to pass in the front page of the newspaper.
[02:43:58.090 --> 02:44:04.017]  I agree, and they use preachers that always put a date on it and then give it attention to discredit it.
[02:44:04.077 --> 02:44:05.880]  But look at the cashless society.
[02:44:06.220 --> 02:44:07.482]  Look at the world government.
[02:44:07.782 --> 02:44:09.184]  Look at Gog and Magog.
[02:44:09.484 --> 02:44:12.468]  Look at everything that Revelations predicts.
[02:44:13.209 --> 02:44:17.394]  How could a science fiction book from 2,000 years ago be so accurate?
[02:44:19.122 --> 02:44:35.813]  I was in a movie just recently, and it was about the end, and I looked at my watch, and it wasn't a biblical movie, it was just a regular, I can't remember which one it was, but I said, you know what, some of these producers and things, they're forecasting what this could be like.
[02:44:36.033 --> 02:44:40.436]  I mean, they're seeing something, even in the movies, they're seeing something.
[02:44:41.076 --> 02:44:53.549]  And unfortunately, you know, that's why I think it's important for us, and I'm not preaching to your listeners, but, you know, we've got to evolve with God because I think things are going to get worse.
[02:44:53.649 --> 02:44:59.174]  I think, you know, I'm not a doom and gloom person, but you can just see it happening.
[02:45:00.175 --> 02:45:03.916]  We hear it when I listen to you and study other things and look around.
[02:45:03.976 --> 02:45:07.637]  I mean, it's just happening left and right and it's happening, you know, really quick.
[02:45:07.677 --> 02:45:15.360]  So I just tell people to get close to God and stay there because that's the only security when it comes down to everything that we have.
[02:45:17.705 --> 02:45:23.388]  I agree with you, and expanding on that, look at the flash floods that have killed at least three in Colorado.
[02:45:23.408 --> 02:45:25.829]  30-foot surge of water, mud, rocks.
[02:45:27.090 --> 02:45:29.731]  The National Weather Service warns of biblical rainfall.
[02:45:29.751 --> 02:45:30.331]  That's a quote.
[02:45:30.791 --> 02:45:32.512]  Smashes record set in 1940.
[02:45:32.912 --> 02:45:34.253]  National Guard called in.
[02:45:34.693 --> 02:45:36.274]  Towns set curfews.
[02:45:36.394 --> 02:45:37.695]  Mass evacuations.
[02:45:38.895 --> 02:45:45.340]  Meanwhile, there'll be a flood and people won't even leave their house when they're told to because they're busy watching MTV.
[02:45:45.380 --> 02:45:50.984]  And it really is like people that are dialed into pop culture do not even know that they're on a planet.
[02:45:51.704 --> 02:45:53.586]  They don't even know there's a world going on.
[02:45:53.626 --> 02:45:59.670]  They just think it's all the television and those people on the screen have a life and that they don't have a life.
[02:45:59.690 --> 02:46:01.912]  And what I'm saying is no, we all have a life.
[02:46:02.412 --> 02:46:04.713]  We're all on a big spaceship in deep space.
[02:46:04.773 --> 02:46:05.434]  It's beautiful.
[02:46:05.834 --> 02:46:07.395]  God's creations are all around us.
[02:46:08.015 --> 02:46:14.839]  And there's so many people to work with and help and be good and just be loving and stand against evil.
[02:46:15.836 --> 02:46:17.497]  Yeah, and that's what we have to do.
[02:46:17.557 --> 02:46:19.218]  I mean, I'm always reaching out.
[02:46:19.258 --> 02:46:27.623]  I mean, you know, there's a lot of people out there that want, you know, I believe people are looking for good now.
[02:46:27.683 --> 02:46:28.864]  I think people are tired.
[02:46:28.944 --> 02:46:38.150]  I think this generation are tired of all the stuff, some of the songs and some of the stuff that's been
[02:46:39.011 --> 02:46:39.791]  We're good to go.
[02:47:02.033 --> 02:47:03.555]  I was tired of the drugs.
[02:47:03.615 --> 02:47:05.076]  I was tired of the partying.
[02:47:05.136 --> 02:47:13.403]  I was tired of just, you know, I really wanted them, when I'd come across people that seemed like they had something good, had a light about them, you know what I mean?
[02:47:13.723 --> 02:47:26.193]  I would gravitate toward them, and I think that's what made me go somewhat towards the Lord, because I'd run into these people who'd just say a few little things like, hey, God loves you, or He's got something special for you.
[02:47:26.213 --> 02:47:27.234]  They wouldn't preach to me.
[02:47:28.439 --> 02:47:28.999]  Do anything.
[02:47:29.019 --> 02:47:30.400]  Take me to church.
[02:47:30.440 --> 02:47:32.402]  They just said that it would just get a hold of me.
[02:47:32.962 --> 02:47:36.124]  And I think this generation really wants good stuff.
[02:47:37.205 --> 02:47:38.325]  You know, good music.
[02:47:38.625 --> 02:47:39.566]  They want good music.
[02:47:39.786 --> 02:47:45.430]  I think, honestly, I think my daughter's song, this one just came out, is a very good song.
[02:47:45.490 --> 02:47:46.690]  And it's a clean.
[02:47:47.391 --> 02:47:51.613]  It's not got a bunch of bump and grind and sex and rock and roll.
[02:47:51.653 --> 02:47:52.214]  And I think
[02:47:52.754 --> 02:47:57.176]  I think it's just a time that people are just wanting to see some more light.
[02:47:57.416 --> 02:47:58.256]  You know, I agree with you.
[02:47:58.296 --> 02:47:59.857]  I've got Drudge Report up right now.
[02:47:59.897 --> 02:48:00.637]  We can punch it up.
[02:48:00.757 --> 02:48:01.397]  It's crazy.
[02:48:01.878 --> 02:48:06.299]  There's a Netflix ad for Katy Perry, part of me, that just popped up.
[02:48:06.319 --> 02:48:08.060]  So here I am talking to Katy Perry's dad.
[02:48:08.080 --> 02:48:11.221]  And, you know, there's your daughter popping up there.
[02:48:11.261 --> 02:48:13.562]  And I know the short leash they keep celebrities on.
[02:48:14.182 --> 02:48:20.725]  I've been inside Hollywood at the highest levels, inside music at the highest levels, just by happenstance over the years.
[02:48:21.425 --> 02:48:27.330]  And I always found it fascinating to watch how it's mafioso and how they're running these people.
[02:48:27.390 --> 02:48:40.162]  And they tell them, you criticize Obama, you criticize gun control, we don't care if you're selling 5 million downloads a year, you're not going to be on the tour, you're going to be off the radio.
[02:48:40.262 --> 02:48:42.584]  Hollywood people, I've been there when they're threatened.
[02:48:42.624 --> 02:48:45.366]  I was there when Mark Cuban was threatened by the White House.
[02:48:46.027 --> 02:48:47.728]  And it came out years later in the New York Times.
[02:48:48.469 --> 02:48:50.471]  And I talked about it before it came out in the New York Times.
[02:48:50.651 --> 02:48:54.614]  The White House said, we're going to put you in jail if you put out this 9-11 truth film.
[02:48:55.014 --> 02:49:01.299]  So I'm surprised your daughter's able to be as clean as she is with this devilish system running.
[02:49:01.339 --> 02:49:03.381]  And so again, we're not judging her.
[02:49:03.401 --> 02:49:06.824]  I've been critical of the military propaganda film she was in.
[02:49:06.844 --> 02:49:09.566]  But that's so sophisticated, I don't think she probably even understood that.
[02:49:09.806 --> 02:49:14.470]  But what I was going to say is, imagine if not just Katy Perry, but other big celebrities that are listening.
[02:49:14.770 --> 02:49:17.131]  Because they call me all the time, they're always scared to go public.
[02:49:17.631 --> 02:49:21.293]  Imagine if people just started going public and doing what they wanted.
[02:49:21.673 --> 02:49:23.274]  We could flip the system over.
[02:49:23.374 --> 02:49:31.577]  They try to keep celebrities in this worldly system on a short leash so they can control them to push their agenda.
[02:49:31.857 --> 02:49:42.682]  And I'm calling, as this global awakening happens, for celebrities across the board to start bucking the system however they can, because they can't shut everybody down.
[02:49:42.722 --> 02:49:43.482]  What do you say to that, sir?
[02:49:44.349 --> 02:49:52.074]  Well, yeah, I believe that's true, and I believe that voice needs to go out and people need to listen to it and hear it and do something about it.
[02:49:52.234 --> 02:49:54.676]  You know, you were talking about Dave Mustaine.
[02:49:55.236 --> 02:50:06.023]  We know him, too, and we've even had Bible studies in his house, and he's really a type of person, even though his music, you know, is a little bit different.
[02:50:06.423 --> 02:50:09.525]  He's really, you know, really loves God and
[02:50:10.866 --> 02:50:16.289]  He was so kind to us a while back here.
[02:50:16.349 --> 02:50:21.631]  We were moving and we were trying to find a house to buy.
[02:50:22.412 --> 02:50:27.774]  So he said, hey, I've got this beach cabin in Oceanside, California.
[02:50:27.794 --> 02:50:30.515]  He wants you and your wife to stay there until you make your mind up.
[02:50:31.176 --> 02:50:31.796]  So we went.
[02:50:32.616 --> 02:50:39.073]  And really, he was on your program the other month, I think it was, and he was speaking out.
[02:50:39.414 --> 02:50:41.138]  And, you know, he's got a voice.
[02:50:41.821 --> 02:50:46.144]  Yeah, and he certainly, they've certainly persecuted him over it, but I'm not going to say any more.
[02:50:46.164 --> 02:50:46.945]  No, no.
[02:50:47.865 --> 02:50:49.987]  I mean, that's the amazing thing about it.
[02:50:50.407 --> 02:50:54.830]  In fact, it was Dave that told me you were a listener about a year ago and said, oh, to contact you, you were a great guy.
[02:50:54.870 --> 02:50:57.472]  And then I heard about it and said, hey, I ought to get that book.
[02:50:57.492 --> 02:50:59.153]  And then I read it and I totally resonated with it.
[02:50:59.453 --> 02:51:00.314]  So now here you're here.
[02:51:00.334 --> 02:51:01.154]  So that's how that happened.
[02:51:01.174 --> 02:51:04.937]  But speaking of Dave, Dave was never what you call a devil worshiper.
[02:51:05.097 --> 02:51:06.578]  This is, he's saying his own words here.
[02:51:07.038 --> 02:51:10.080]  But if you listen to his songs, they're almost prophetic.
[02:51:10.120 --> 02:51:11.041]  I'm a big Megadeth fan.
[02:51:12.082 --> 02:51:28.380]  And they're about the New World Order and the end of the world, because he grew up a Christian, and he and his wife Pam are... People think of Dave Mustaine as the really mean guy that could beat up like, you know, ten people, really tough guy, really wild, all that stuff, just like I was very similar to that when I was growing up.
[02:51:28.980 --> 02:51:43.977]  And, but now to know him, he is all about controlling his worldliness, being so loving, so good to people, and I've watched the world, that know him really good, mess with him too, and he knows that, and he's being good, and now he's getting all these blessings.
[02:51:44.297 --> 02:51:46.319]  But yeah, just an example.
[02:51:47.040 --> 02:52:01.952]  Just an example of he is such a sweetheart, and his wife is such a sweetheart, and his kids are such sweethearts, and they stay at our house and stuff when they come to town, that it's just amazing to again think of what Dave has become.
[02:52:01.972 --> 02:52:03.474]  And he was always an amazing person.
[02:52:05.235 --> 02:52:11.721]  But it's almost like there's such energy in youth that that's why it's so easy for it to get out of control.
[02:52:12.768 --> 02:52:13.088]  Right.
[02:52:13.488 --> 02:52:32.220]  You know, I think, too, you know, always darkness tries to put out the light, you know, and you're always trying to do, you know, people like Dave, myself, you, when you're putting out the truth and you're trying to tell people, warn people, show people, make them aware of things, you know, we're going against the grain.
[02:52:32.880 --> 02:52:35.462]  I mean, if you're a Christian today, if Jesus is
[02:52:37.743 --> 02:52:38.103]  I don't know.
[02:52:54.416 --> 02:52:59.563]  To be, to have people, good people around you is better than a bunch of people that are no good.
[02:53:00.324 --> 02:53:05.670]  And it's just, when we're out there, you know, they don't like our opposition.
[02:53:06.031 --> 02:53:09.095]  And I'm like I said, I don't try to go preaching to these people.
[02:53:10.436 --> 02:53:12.157]  They see that I'm different and I am alive.
[02:53:12.317 --> 02:53:15.718]  Exactly, but don't short shrift yourself.
[02:53:15.918 --> 02:53:23.602]  For 40 years, as you said, you've been reaching out to millions of people very successfully and tried to do it through your daughter's music and then that went another direction.
[02:53:23.622 --> 02:53:33.286]  But I think it's going to end up coming back the other way and that she's going to end up being bigger than ever and as a mighty weapon against the New World Order and all these forces.
[02:53:33.666 --> 02:53:36.087]  And I think I already see that boomerang coming back around, sir.
[02:53:36.963 --> 02:53:38.544]  Yes, I've received that.
[02:53:39.084 --> 02:53:39.424]  I do.
[02:53:39.824 --> 02:54:03.355]  I tell you, we pray a lot, my wife and I do, for a lot of things, you know, not just for our family, but for a lot of things that's going on, and I think that you've got a lot of listeners that pray, too, really, about, for you and for what's going on in this world, and that's what really, you know, counts a lot, and it keeps us, and it helps us, so we've got to stay on that course.
[02:54:03.715 --> 02:54:06.997]  Well, Keith Hudson's written the amazing short book.
[02:54:07.037 --> 02:54:07.997]  I recommend everybody gets it.
[02:54:08.437 --> 02:54:09.378]  Looking and Seeing.
[02:54:09.458 --> 02:54:10.539]  Great for parents to read.
[02:54:10.599 --> 02:54:13.080]  Great for your children of any age, really, to read.
[02:54:13.100 --> 02:54:15.541]  I'd say about 14, 15, they'll understand it.
[02:54:15.581 --> 02:54:16.862]  It's very well written.
[02:54:17.242 --> 02:54:18.543]  KeithHudson.org.
[02:54:18.583 --> 02:54:19.343]  I said com earlier.
[02:54:19.383 --> 02:54:19.803]  It's org.
[02:54:23.465 --> 02:54:24.026]  Absolutely.
[02:54:24.046 --> 02:54:26.868]  I mean, what you're here talking about is everything.
[02:54:27.188 --> 02:54:36.135]  And the best people I've found have been the Prodigal Sons, like myself, yourself, Katie, obviously, Dave Mustaine.
[02:54:36.335 --> 02:54:37.676]  They've gone through the fire.
[02:54:37.716 --> 02:54:42.419]  They always had a good heart, but got caught a little bit, like we all do, by the devil's snares.
[02:54:42.920 --> 02:54:46.602]  But almost going through the fire makes our metal even better.
[02:54:46.903 --> 02:54:49.745]  And then when you get to know somebody now, I guess for like
[02:54:50.896 --> 02:54:52.417]  Six years or so, Dave Mustaine.
[02:55:10.724 --> 02:55:21.355]  Loving Christian people, not the fake plastic church, but the real church that's in our heart that can revolutionize this world and bring us back from the brink of thermonuclear war.
[02:55:21.395 --> 02:55:27.961]  And no matter what happens, what do you say about the churches that say, don't worry about all the bad stuff that's happening, God will take care of it?
[02:55:28.062 --> 02:55:33.167]  Isn't it during these bad times that we should be working even more so that people know about the choice they have?
[02:55:34.105 --> 02:55:36.506]  Oh yeah, we've got to let people know.
[02:55:36.546 --> 02:55:43.629]  You've got to tell people the truth and let people know because they're just going down that path and being led astray.
[02:55:43.709 --> 02:55:48.751]  And like you said a while back, we were all caught up into all kinds of things.
[02:55:49.311 --> 02:55:52.313]  But we've got to stay out there with our voice.
[02:55:53.053 --> 02:55:58.415]  And like I said, you have a voice and others, Dave and myself, and there's many, many more.
[02:55:58.435 --> 02:56:01.477]  A lot of the people you've had on your program have a voice.
[02:56:01.517 --> 02:56:02.317]  We just have to keep
[02:56:02.998 --> 02:56:08.145]  You know, speaking that voice into what's going on in this world, the truth.
[02:56:08.345 --> 02:56:09.727]  You know, people got into the truth.
[02:56:10.688 --> 02:56:13.733]  You were born to know the truth.
[02:56:14.491 --> 02:56:15.772]  Your spirit wants to know.
[02:56:15.792 --> 02:56:21.576]  They don't want to hear all this, but your spirit, because God created us, it wants to hear the truth.
[02:56:21.656 --> 02:56:27.720]  And when somebody does speak the truth, they go, oh yeah, that's what caught me listening to you.
[02:56:28.360 --> 02:56:30.782]  Somebody told me, he speaks the truth.
[02:56:30.822 --> 02:56:31.943]  You got to listen to this guy.
[02:56:31.983 --> 02:56:37.246]  So I turned you on, and what you were saying was, and it registered in my spirit, bam, it's over two years now.
[02:56:37.787 --> 02:56:39.268]  And you know, I never thought
[02:56:39.728 --> 02:56:43.831]  I would never think I would be on your program just talking to me.
[02:56:43.851 --> 02:56:51.056]  I'm going to have to, you know, sit down after this because I'm really, I'm really honored that you would even give me the time of day.
[02:56:52.042 --> 02:57:10.852]  Well, sir, what you've done is very important, and I've seen Russell Brand, who I've gotten a chance to talk to off-air, and he listens to the show, and he's been listening for a long time, and that's helped, I think, wake him up to a certain degree, and I think he's on a trajectory to really become a powerful voice for liberty, period.
[02:57:11.392 --> 02:57:19.517]  Same thing with your daughter, and the Mustangs just told me what a wonderful person you were, and then I read your book, and it was very touching to me, looking and seeing
[02:57:20.157 --> 02:57:23.881]  And so that's why you've been here, and I've seen your speeches, too, online.
[02:57:23.901 --> 02:57:24.842]  You're a powerful speaker.
[02:57:24.862 --> 02:57:27.344]  You're being very humble here today, sir.
[02:57:27.824 --> 02:57:32.769]  People can find your speeches and work and where you're going to be speaking at KeithHudson.org.
[02:57:33.009 --> 02:57:38.655]  And we just want to thank you for what you're doing, and also wanted you to be able to set the record straight.
[02:57:39.755 --> 02:57:43.078]  On where you stand on your daughter, because who are we to judge anybody?
[02:57:43.378 --> 02:57:51.663]  I think we can judge the people that are actively out there doing bad, but people that are just a little off the path, it's our job to help get them back on the path.
[02:57:51.723 --> 02:57:53.264]  Lord knows, I'm off the path.
[02:57:53.684 --> 02:57:57.327]  I mean, I've got a big heart and love God, but I've also got a very big dark side.
[02:57:57.827 --> 02:58:00.209]  And we all do, and so we've got to deal with that.
[02:58:01.089 --> 02:58:03.011]  Well, I appreciate you allowing me.
[02:58:03.131 --> 02:58:03.992]  We pray for you.
[02:58:04.032 --> 02:58:07.716]  We're going to continue, and I tell people all the time about your program.
[02:58:08.576 --> 02:58:10.518]  I'll get you some listeners.
[02:58:10.619 --> 02:58:17.926]  I even told a bunch today that I'm just going to do an interview with you, and so I'm getting them plugged in.
[02:58:17.946 --> 02:58:19.668]  That's what we've got to do, get people plugged in.
[02:58:19.688 --> 02:58:20.729]  The more people here, the more.
[02:58:24.392 --> 02:58:29.715]  I really appreciate you, and I'll definitely, my wife and I will pray for you, and thank you for allowing me to be on.
[02:58:29.755 --> 02:58:31.796]  Yes sir, well listen, I need the prayers right now.
[02:58:32.096 --> 02:58:33.657]  Got a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes.
[02:58:34.377 --> 02:58:37.639]  We're at a critical juncture, so there's a lot of stuff going on obviously with the enemy.
[02:58:37.979 --> 02:58:42.781]  Please pray for us, sir, and I'll pray for you, and when you're next in Texas, I'd like to have you in studio, sir.
[02:58:43.542 --> 02:58:44.382]  Yeah, I'd love to come.
[02:58:44.422 --> 02:58:45.222]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[02:58:45.723 --> 02:58:46.323]  Thank you, Keith.
[02:58:46.363 --> 02:58:46.643]  Amazing.
[02:58:46.683 --> 02:58:47.484]  Let me say bye to you here.
[02:58:50.425 --> 02:58:52.166]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:53.820 --> 02:58:56.036]  Visit GCNlive.com today!
[02:58:58.943 --> 02:59:02.585]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us?
[02:59:02.805 --> 02:59:08.088]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[02:59:08.328 --> 02:59:15.871]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[02:59:16.052 --> 02:59:25.176]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[02:59:25.356 --> 02:59:32.364]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[02:59:32.524 --> 02:59:35.407]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[02:59:35.427 --> 02:59:41.353]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse, but demand.
[02:59:41.934 --> 02:59:42.415]  A war.
[02:59:42.915 --> 02:59:43.816]  Oh, there's another one!
[02:59:43.876 --> 02:59:45.177]  Another plane just hit!
[02:59:45.217 --> 02:59:46.038]  State of Mind.
[02:59:46.298 --> 02:59:47.739]  Because there's a war on.
[02:59:47.860 --> 02:59:48.620]  For your mind.
[02:59:48.901 --> 02:59:52.924]  Get your copy of State of Mind the movie at InfoWars.com.
[02:59:53.084 --> 02:59:58.209]  And remember, every order at InfoWarsStore.com receives a free citizen rulebook.
[02:59:59.710 --> 03:00:00.892]  Coast to Coast.
[03:00:01.252 --> 03:00:02.653]  Direct from Austin.
[03:00:03.314 --> 03:00:06.517]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:13.564 --> 03:00:17.766]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:00:18.407 --> 03:00:19.207]  You want answers?
[03:00:19.987 --> 03:00:20.888]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:21.528 --> 03:00:25.190]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:25.731 --> 03:00:29.793]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:31.388 --> 03:00:36.251]  Yeah, I knew that if my friends told me that Pasteur was a really good guy, he would be, and his book's great.
[03:00:36.651 --> 03:00:39.593]  And, uh, I didn't even really get him on because he's Katy Perry's dad.
[03:00:40.433 --> 03:00:43.035]  I got him on because the Mustang said he was such an interesting guy, but it's weird.
[03:00:43.555 --> 03:00:47.478]  I've had now Russell Brandt on, Katy Perry's dad, now I didn't get Katy Perry on.
[03:00:48.038 --> 03:00:50.158]  Because, you know, I can say mean things, too, folks.
[03:00:50.659 --> 03:00:51.779]  I'm sure her dad's aware of that.
[03:00:51.799 --> 03:00:53.239]  Like, look at this war propaganda.
[03:00:53.619 --> 03:00:55.780]  Look at her putting this out to get young women to be part of it.
[03:00:56.280 --> 03:01:00.480]  And I do that just because I get upset about it, because now they're going to shoot the women up full of vaccines and all the rest of it.
[03:01:01.021 --> 03:01:06.622]  But by doing that, we can talk about Katy Perry now and then expose, you know, how they're going to try to propagandize her.
[03:01:07.322 --> 03:01:09.142]  And now she's going in a better direction.
[03:01:09.202 --> 03:01:11.903]  It's not my job to sit there and, you know, do that.
[03:01:13.467 --> 03:01:17.569]  Just if I keep running across people's paths, it means I'm supposed to get them on air.
[03:01:17.589 --> 03:01:23.192]  If you just joined us, we had Katy Perry's dad on for like 40 minutes, and we got all this other world news going on.
[03:01:23.212 --> 03:01:32.936]  We first had a top CIA briefer to the president's on Ray McGovern, and then we shifted gears into that for the Friday show.
[03:01:32.956 --> 03:01:34.177]  I didn't take any calls today.
[03:01:34.877 --> 03:01:37.358]  I'm going to take calls this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:01:37.378 --> 03:01:40.180]  Central, with the Sunday broadcast.
[03:01:41.460 --> 03:01:49.423]  And I'm really going to focus in on the latest developments in Syria, but mainly the attack on the press.
[03:01:51.124 --> 03:01:54.045]  Because that is the big kahuna.
[03:01:54.646 --> 03:02:02.169]  You don't just have the suppression of the Tea Party and the IRS being caught now in emails saying, go after Tea Party, destroy them.
[03:02:03.049 --> 03:02:04.490]  I mean, they should all be indicted.
[03:02:04.530 --> 03:02:05.770]  That's racketeering.
[03:02:06.290 --> 03:02:07.271]  That's organized crime.
[03:02:08.660 --> 03:02:09.220]  That's what that is.
[03:02:09.261 --> 03:02:12.824]  When groups get together and it goes, illegally suppress somebody's civil rights.
[03:02:13.584 --> 03:02:14.885]  That's civil right violation.
[03:02:14.905 --> 03:02:15.806]  It's mafia behavior.
[03:02:16.547 --> 03:02:18.408]  And they have racketeering laws for that.
[03:02:19.930 --> 03:02:23.172]  But of course, the mafia runs itself, so the problem is how do you stop that?
[03:02:23.192 --> 03:02:25.995]  Well, they've made some of them resign, but that's not enough.
[03:02:26.195 --> 03:02:33.882]  They're coming out with a thing to protect the press, but then it actually gets rid of the freedom of the press, or lets the government define who is press and who isn't.
[03:02:34.482 --> 03:02:36.264]  That's passed the Senate Committee.
[03:02:39.557 --> 03:02:42.059]  It's coming out that Google is NSA.
[03:02:42.499 --> 03:02:45.080]  NSA disguised itself as Google to spy.
[03:02:45.100 --> 03:02:49.984]  And, I mean, that's exactly what I've told you for years, and there it is, CNET News.
[03:02:52.305 --> 03:02:54.746]  And we've got all this other just incredible stuff.
[03:02:54.807 --> 03:02:57.528]  I'll be quite frank with you, I'm pretty exhausted right now.
[03:02:57.548 --> 03:03:01.251]  And I've got to go work on Obama deception.
[03:03:02.577 --> 03:03:05.280]  To late tonight, but I've got to do it or my children have no future.
[03:03:05.300 --> 03:03:07.262]  And I'm not whining like, oh, I got to work so hard.
[03:03:07.902 --> 03:03:13.888]  I tell you that because sometimes by the end of the show, I feel like a squeezed lemon.
[03:03:15.129 --> 03:03:19.053]  I mean, I feel like I've been put through the meat grinder right now.
[03:03:19.093 --> 03:03:20.474]  Some days I feel great after the show.
[03:03:21.455 --> 03:03:27.021]  But thinking of all the angles, trying to be accurate,
[03:03:29.525 --> 03:03:41.810]  I think focusing on all the stuff the Globalist is doing intensely for three hours, it's like going to a funeral for three hours and standing above the open casket of somebody you cared about.
[03:03:42.850 --> 03:03:44.031]  You know, it's very intense.
[03:03:45.171 --> 03:03:47.732]  I gotta go do that this Saturday for Raymond Teague.
[03:03:48.372 --> 03:03:52.874]  I wanna go honor him, you know, good friend of mine for, I don't know, like 14, 15 years.
[03:03:53.114 --> 03:03:53.874]  It's about that long.
[03:03:53.934 --> 03:03:54.254]  Wow!
[03:03:55.135 --> 03:03:58.076]  But at the same time, you know, it's like it's all heavy.
[03:03:59.332 --> 03:04:02.093]  Everything's just so heavy, and I know why people tune out of it all.
[03:04:02.614 --> 03:04:04.094]  I know why they don't care and just give up.
[03:04:05.675 --> 03:04:07.076]  Because it is just insane.
[03:04:07.136 --> 03:04:08.236]  It's just insane.
[03:04:08.256 --> 03:04:13.359]  And it's so hard to look at all these club lists and all the things they're doing.
[03:04:14.579 --> 03:04:16.140]  Ugh, it's so sickening.
[03:04:18.841 --> 03:04:24.284]  Samantha Powers, I mean, just up there, like she was all sexy, like she was Wonder Woman, shaking her hair around.
[03:04:25.100 --> 03:04:26.080]  Really getting off on it.
[03:04:26.100 --> 03:04:27.581]  We don't care about the chemical weapons.
[03:04:27.621 --> 03:04:28.401]  He's hurting the children.
[03:04:28.741 --> 03:04:29.461]  And we're going in.
[03:04:29.521 --> 03:04:30.341]  He started this.
[03:04:30.401 --> 03:04:32.402]  And to know they're the people that started it.
[03:04:32.762 --> 03:04:34.242]  They're the people that put Al-Qaeda in.
[03:04:34.262 --> 03:04:35.882]  I mean, it's just, it's like too much.
[03:04:36.462 --> 03:04:37.243]  It's too much.
[03:04:37.303 --> 03:04:43.344]  I mean, you know, when Kerry was at least shaking and looked like he was going to pass out unhappy, I was like, good, see, you're unhappy.
[03:04:43.744 --> 03:04:44.304]  You deserve it.
[03:04:44.944 --> 03:04:51.366]  But with them, it's just, they're all stomping around like they're a beautiful horse or something, getting off on stomping on the bodies of children.
[03:04:51.386 --> 03:04:51.986]  And I just like, argh!
[03:04:53.353 --> 03:04:54.134]  I mean, that's really it.
[03:04:54.174 --> 03:04:56.057]  It just makes me want to throw up!
[03:04:56.678 --> 03:05:01.585]  And then, see, then I get angry, and then I get exhausted, and I just, I'm just... Folks, let's put an end to these people.
[03:05:02.066 --> 03:05:05.672]  Let's recognize good from evil, let's speak out against them, and it's happening.
[03:05:05.972 --> 03:05:07.675]  We're turning the tide against these devils.
[03:05:09.082 --> 03:05:13.646]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[03:05:13.806 --> 03:05:16.769]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[03:05:16.929 --> 03:05:22.154]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[03:05:22.494 --> 03:05:24.136]  It all comes down to one thing.
[03:05:24.416 --> 03:05:25.497]  We are what we eat.
