[00:00:11.232 --> 00:00:13.394]  So the NSA is watching your every move.
[00:00:13.574 --> 00:00:14.314]  Who cares, right?
[00:00:14.334 --> 00:00:15.535]  You're not doing anything wrong.
[00:00:15.956 --> 00:00:20.699]  Well, as NSA whistleblower William Binney pointed out, you don't get to decide what's wrong.
[00:00:20.979 --> 00:00:22.220]  The central government does.
[00:00:22.921 --> 00:00:26.343]  In fact, you could be breaking a law right now that you're not even aware of.
[00:00:26.944 --> 00:00:33.029]  Take a look at some of these laws that, while they may be outdated and unenforced, most of them are still on the books.
[00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:37.972]  It's against the law to take a bite out of someone else's hamburger in Oklahoma.
[00:00:38.452 --> 00:00:40.213]  Sporting a goatee in Boston?
[00:00:40.593 --> 00:00:43.775]  Well, you better have a permit for that, you whiskery wrongdoer!
[00:00:44.676 --> 00:00:52.381]  In Iowa and Eureka, Nevada, it's illegal for a man with a mustache to, under any circumstances, kiss a woman in public.
[00:00:53.081 --> 00:00:54.803]  Sorry ladies and hipsters.
[00:00:55.443 --> 00:01:06.012]  A Chicago municipal code from 1911 banned people who were diseased, maimed, mutilated or deformed to the point of being an unsightly or disgusting object from going out in public.
[00:01:06.993 --> 00:01:11.476]  Did you know that it is illegal to fart in public in Florida after 6 p.m.?
[00:01:11.516 --> 00:01:12.917]  Yes, I've heard about that.
[00:01:13.238 --> 00:01:15.620]  They're very serious about their clean air there.
[00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:16.360]  Oh really?
[00:01:17.526 --> 00:01:21.669]  In Indiana, a bill was proposed to make law that the value of pi is three.
[00:01:21.989 --> 00:01:27.113]  Thankfully, a mathematics professor was present in the legislature that day, and the bill didn't pass.
[00:01:27.734 --> 00:01:35.980]  In New Hampshire, you may not tap your feet, nod your head, or in any way keep time with the music played in a tavern, restaurant, or cafe.
[00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.383]  Have you ever heard of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act?
[00:01:39.843 --> 00:01:41.644]  Well, you've probably violated it.
[00:01:42.165 --> 00:01:45.127]  Have you ever signed on to an unsecure Wi-Fi network?
[00:01:45.287 --> 00:01:46.668]  What does unsecure mean?
[00:01:46.708 --> 00:01:47.548]  Just like free?
[00:01:47.808 --> 00:01:52.951]  You're sitting in your apartment and someone doesn't have their thing locked down so you're like, oh I'm gonna go on the internet.
[00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:53.571]  Yes I have.
[00:01:54.331 --> 00:01:55.652]  Well that is a federal offense.
[00:01:55.832 --> 00:02:00.234]  Have you ever used a fake name when signing up for an internet account?
[00:02:00.674 --> 00:02:01.435]  Yeah, of course.
[00:02:01.846 --> 00:02:03.247]  Yeah, that's breaking the law too.
[00:02:03.448 --> 00:02:04.388]  Also a felony.
[00:02:04.769 --> 00:02:05.409]  Oh, okay.
[00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.011]  Okay, okay.
[00:02:07.071 --> 00:02:11.915]  So you did not mean to commit a federal crime of hacking when you logged on as Seymour Buns.
[00:02:12.376 --> 00:02:18.461]  But it just goes to show how easy it is to pass a law simply to control behavior that some people find offensive.
[00:02:18.942 --> 00:02:25.208]  In fact, you don't even have to break the law in order to get arrested for doing something others find disagreeable.
[00:02:25.768 --> 00:02:34.332]  Jeff Olson is facing a 13-year jail sentence for writing anti-bank messages in water-soluble chalk on the sidewalk.
[00:02:34.832 --> 00:02:44.776]  And a 14-year-old would never be facing a year of jail time just for refusing to change his shirt if Obama hadn't waged an all-out war against the Second Amendment.
[00:02:45.456 --> 00:02:53.618]  And don't even think about bong waterboarding, snarky caricatures of political pundits, or your entire YouTube account will be wiped out.
[00:02:54.398 --> 00:03:00.580]  What you're doing today could seem harmless, but a year from now it could be damaging just based on the whims of those in power.
[00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.181]  And the police already abuse the immense power that they have.
[00:03:04.641 --> 00:03:14.164]  So if the NSA is recording every move that you make, and somewhere along the line technically everyone is going to break the law, punishment becomes purely selective.
[00:03:14.884 --> 00:03:20.049]  Basically, those in power will have whatever they need to punish whoever they like, whenever they choose.
[00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.774]  So the question shouldn't be, I'm not doing anything wrong, so why should I care if I'm being spied on?
[00:03:26.494 --> 00:03:32.940]  The question is, if I am not doing anything wrong, then why the hell do you think you have the right to spy on me?
[00:03:33.901 --> 00:03:37.004]  I'm Leanne McAdoo, and this has been an InfoWars Nightly News Alert.
