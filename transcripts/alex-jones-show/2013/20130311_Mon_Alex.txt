[00:00:06.465 --> 00:00:10.647]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:11.288 --> 00:00:12.088]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:13.809]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.092]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.612 --> 00:00:22.674]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:44.382]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is the 11th day, the 11th day of March 2013.
[00:00:44.582 --> 00:00:48.565]  I am your host, Alex Jones, here back in the saddle.
[00:00:48.605 --> 00:00:53.889]  Got back on Saturday, did the Sunday broadcast, 4 to 6, and here we are live.
[00:00:54.669 --> 00:01:02.554]  Max Keiser has made his prediction that you'll see the bond market blow up by the end of April, and he has been saying the last week as I'm reading his tweets,
[00:01:03.935 --> 00:01:12.878]  When he retweets over to the real Alex Jones, that he's seen movement in different areas of the market that show that indeed his prediction is going to come true.
[00:01:13.258 --> 00:01:14.118]  I hope he's wrong.
[00:01:14.558 --> 00:01:28.342]  Even though I don't like this system, any collapse will be used to give the system even more power, because we haven't done our job yet of really getting the people aware of who is behind problem, reaction, solution.
[00:01:29.318 --> 00:01:34.102]  I'm also, because he's been promoting this, one of the first people I heard talk about this a couple of years ago, Bitcoin.
[00:01:34.783 --> 00:01:40.528]  And I know a little bit about it, but not enough to really be able to definitively say what I think about it.
[00:01:40.788 --> 00:01:42.309]  I think alternative currencies are great.
[00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:52.658]  I think the idea is wonderful, but the way it's being promoted feverishly everywhere, and no one knows who really created it,
[00:01:53.867 --> 00:02:03.348]  Could they destroy it down the road and sucker a bunch of people as a way to demonize private digital fiat currencies?
[00:02:05.543 --> 00:02:29.033]  And I think it's important to say that because when I see the wild-eyed, almost foaming at the mouth, when I was downtown for South by Southwest demonstrating against South by Southwest reportedly trying to get police and code enforcers and then even private goons to not let us, our street team, hand out free and full horse magazines to the media
[00:02:30.023 --> 00:02:35.006]  Intelligentsia and the wannabes that are down there trying to be given entrance into it.
[00:02:35.686 --> 00:02:40.568]  I thought that, I thought that we would send the crew down there and do that.
[00:02:40.588 --> 00:02:42.009]  It was actually Max Cabrera's idea.
[00:02:42.029 --> 00:02:46.911]  Head of PlanetInfoWorks.com over there with Christy and the rest of the great crew.
[00:02:47.492 --> 00:02:50.333]  And I was just shocked by the fact that they tried to do that.
[00:02:50.833 --> 00:02:51.794]  But that's a side issue.
[00:02:52.314 --> 00:02:57.076]  I had people coming over to me asking about
[00:02:59.181 --> 00:03:05.586]  Bitcoin over and over again, and then I just see it all over the place, so it's definitely hitting a cresting point.
[00:03:07.547 --> 00:03:10.349]  In fact, guys, will you print me some of the basic data on Bitcoin?
[00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:12.791]  I've read it before, but I meant to do it last night and this morning.
[00:03:12.811 --> 00:03:13.331]  I didn't have time.
[00:03:13.391 --> 00:03:15.733]  I just want it so when Kaiser comes on, I can ask him about that.
[00:03:15.933 --> 00:03:17.234]  That's not the main reason he's coming on.
[00:03:17.254 --> 00:03:18.195]  He's on about the collapse.
[00:03:20.156 --> 00:03:23.659]  It's ongoing, but he says it's going to accelerate into a new plateau.
[00:03:25.623 --> 00:03:29.964]  You know, down below, you know, the heights we've seen, kind of down in the valley.
[00:03:32.024 --> 00:03:37.305]  And so we'll get his take on that, a lot of other geopolitical issues, what's happening with the Euro, and a lot more.
[00:03:37.325 --> 00:03:45.126]  I want to get Webster Tarpley on this week to give us his take on what's happening in places like Italy against the Euro, where he sees that going.
[00:03:45.907 --> 00:03:53.968]  And we do have some other special guests lined up throughout the week that aren't 100% nailed down, so I won't mention, I won't mention that yet, but that is just some of what's coming up today.
[00:03:55.376 --> 00:03:58.258]  I do want to open the phones up in the second hour.
[00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:12.906]  At the bottom of the hour, after I cover a wide range of news, I mean, I've been gone for a week, and if we can do a document cam for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, this is probably the most stacks of news I've had in months.
[00:04:13.527 --> 00:04:16.469]  There's probably 400 news articles here in front of me.
[00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.070]  Every one of them I've scanned over or read.
[00:04:19.991 --> 00:04:22.072]  Every one of them I want to cover on air.
[00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:31.641]  The problem is each one is a rabbit trail off into other connected dots and information, but I've just somehow got to try to get into all this.
[00:04:33.062 --> 00:04:38.103]  So we're going to try to break all that down on the other side of this quick break.
[00:04:38.623 --> 00:04:39.924]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[00:04:39.964 --> 00:04:47.546]  The news websites are InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and of course the news site
[00:04:48.766 --> 00:04:51.330]  The Nightly News site, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:56.297]  Nightly News at 7 o'clock Central, 8 o'clock Eastern, every night with our great news team.
[00:04:56.818 --> 00:04:58.561]  So, PrisonPlanet.tv.

[00:05:00.704 --> 00:05:01.044]  Stay with us.
[00:05:02.185 --> 00:05:10.450]  Devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, or the threat of martial law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies.
[00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:14.172]  As a result, millions are stockpiling food, gold, and weapons.
[00:05:14.412 --> 00:05:18.574]  But how will these items help if you or one of your loved ones becomes ill?
[00:05:18.874 --> 00:05:23.637]  Supernatural silver is the ultimate tool to prepare you for a medical emergency.
[00:05:23.917 --> 00:05:31.421]  Supernatural silver is a natural antibiotic that is uniquely effective against bacteria, viruses, molds, and fungus.
[00:05:31.561 --> 00:05:31.801]  I think so.
[00:06:03.763 --> 00:06:11.450]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal Ben Soap Company.
[00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:15.514]  Alex and his staff have used these pure soap products for years.
[00:06:15.954 --> 00:06:22.780]  These all-natural soaps are made from the highest quality vegetable and coconut oils that are earth-friendly and safe.
[00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.743]  See them on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[00:06:26.283 --> 00:06:30.786]  Or call 800-340-7091 for a free catalog.

[00:06:37.049 --> 00:06:42.152]  Or save big with a 1 to 2 year supply of soaps for all your cleaning needs.
[00:06:42.472 --> 00:06:44.093]  This is an amazing deal.
[00:06:44.453 --> 00:06:49.076]  You can save thousands of dollars and you will love the way real soap makes you feel.
[00:06:49.676 --> 00:06:52.838]  See them on the web at 5starsoap.com or call
[00:06:53.238 --> 00:06:57.319]  800-340-7091 for a free catalog.
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.101]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[00:07:04.381 --> 00:07:09.202]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[00:07:09.402 --> 00:07:16.524]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[00:07:16.704 --> 00:07:22.129]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[00:07:22.349 --> 00:07:26.073]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[00:07:26.373 --> 00:07:30.897]  You've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[00:07:31.097 --> 00:07:36.322]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[00:07:36.562 --> 00:07:39.623]  Strategic Relocation 3rd Edition by Joel Skousen.
[00:07:39.783 --> 00:07:42.024]  When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.
[00:07:42.284 --> 00:07:46.885]  Therosafe used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[00:07:47.045 --> 00:07:49.506]  Hand-cranked shortwave AM FM radios.
[00:07:49.926 --> 00:07:56.968]  Everything that we've researched and found to be the best is available at InfoWarshop.com and your purchase makes our Info War possible.
[00:07:57.128 --> 00:07:58.168]  We're getting prepared.
[00:07:58.408 --> 00:07:58.828]  Are you?
[00:07:59.068 --> 00:07:59.869]  InfoWarshop.com
[00:08:03.643 --> 00:08:09.207]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[00:08:09.667 --> 00:08:12.329]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:18.634]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen, on this Monday, the 18th of March, 2013.
[00:08:19.494 --> 00:08:30.262]  Max Keiser on the global financial meltdown that has been going on for the last four or five years incrementally, that he believes is about to accelerate massively into a serious implosion.
[00:08:31.102 --> 00:08:34.065]  level event by late April.
[00:08:34.105 --> 00:08:40.691]  He now is doubling down saying he sees the signs confirming his prediction of about six months ago, seven months ago.
[00:08:41.151 --> 00:08:43.593]  He'll be joining us on that front and Bitcoin.
[00:08:43.653 --> 00:08:44.134]  What is it?
[00:08:44.514 --> 00:08:45.295]  Who's behind it?
[00:08:45.795 --> 00:08:48.217]  I know he's been a proponent of it, at least in the past.
[00:08:48.257 --> 00:08:53.662]  I want to get his take on Bitcoin today because people keep clamoring for me to cover Bitcoin more.
[00:08:54.163 --> 00:08:56.565]  I've done a lot of research on it and I, again,
[00:08:58.362 --> 00:09:04.605]  I reserve judgment because there's not a lot known about it, who created it, it's very shadowy, and people say, that's the good part.
[00:09:05.666 --> 00:09:13.170]  Well, yeah, it's good if you're anonymous, but then when something's been created and then you don't know about its roots, a little bit of an issue.
[00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:17.472]  I like to watch things for a while until I jump in bed with it.
[00:09:17.732 --> 00:09:27.498]  Not criticizing it, just saying there have been a lot of other financial things like this throughout history that when they have the same wild-eyed, wide-eyed excitement to them,
[00:09:28.717 --> 00:09:32.520]  You better hold on to your rear end and protect yourself.
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:33.360]  That's all I can say.
[00:09:34.021 --> 00:09:34.341]  Okay.
[00:09:34.762 --> 00:09:35.062]  Wow.
[00:09:35.682 --> 00:09:36.543]  Let me just try to do this.
[00:09:36.563 --> 00:09:38.444]  You know, I've tried this a million times, failed every time.
[00:09:39.585 --> 00:09:40.085]  Let's be serious.
[00:09:40.105 --> 00:09:42.127]  I've tried a thousand plus times and failed every time.
[00:09:42.147 --> 00:09:44.529]  I'm going to try to just read to you headlines.
[00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:47.331]  Maybe just 50 of them or so.
[00:09:47.771 --> 00:09:49.492]  Instead of the 300 plus I've got here.
[00:09:50.073 --> 00:09:52.675]  Because I've been really psychoanalyzing myself.
[00:09:54.702 --> 00:10:14.232]  At night, in the morning, when I get to work, I'll just pour over hundreds of articles and almost get into a fractured mindset where I've got so many things in my mind, it's hard to focus in on one big subject and really cover that topic in detail.
[00:10:14.572 --> 00:10:23.257]  And that's a good thing at certain levels because it shows how things are interconnected, but then when you don't get to even 10% of what you want to cover, it's a real frustration.
[00:10:24.244 --> 00:10:30.786]  I can't argue with success, the broadcast is very successful, but I'm trying to make it even more effective against the globalists.
[00:10:31.526 --> 00:10:34.967]  Success of the radio show is not the only goal here.
[00:10:36.068 --> 00:10:39.869]  Success getting the word out for liberty and resisting tyranny is the goal.
[00:10:40.589 --> 00:10:50.172]  A successful radio show is the byproduct and just, it's like a team of horses, it's a horse that runs right beside the main horse, the lead horse.
[00:10:51.012 --> 00:10:51.933]  Now, that said,
[00:10:53.027 --> 00:10:54.935]  I want you just to remember as a listener.
[00:10:56.670 --> 00:11:02.551]  That this is not a spectator sport, and that you are the solution, you are the answer, you are the resistance.
[00:11:02.991 --> 00:11:08.172]  When they tell you you've got to be in a free speech zone to protest, you need to let them arrest you and file suit.
[00:11:08.352 --> 00:11:10.772]  That's why it's been rolled back all over the country, free speech zones.
[00:11:11.092 --> 00:11:18.814]  When they tell you they're not going to organically label food, boycott the stores that won't do it until they capitulate, which is now happening with Whole Foods.
[00:11:19.114 --> 00:11:25.075]  When Mayor Bloomberg says he's going to tell you how many hours to work a day, what to eat, how much to sleep,
[00:11:25.775 --> 00:11:28.016]  What to do in your own home.
[00:11:28.357 --> 00:11:29.417]  It's time to say no to him.
[00:11:29.477 --> 00:11:30.278]  Like Starbucks.
[00:11:30.658 --> 00:11:31.979]  I'm saying Starbucks is perfect.
[00:11:32.299 --> 00:11:32.959]  Certainly not.
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:34.961]  Not a big fan of global chains.
[00:11:35.381 --> 00:11:39.063]  But Starbucks is saying we're going to continue to serve over 16 ounce drinks.
[00:11:39.323 --> 00:11:40.144]  We'll do what we want.
[00:11:40.204 --> 00:11:40.844]  Thank you very much.
[00:11:41.225 --> 00:11:46.087]  Because under Agenda 21, the UN bragged back 20 years ago in 1992.
[00:11:46.708 --> 00:11:47.628]  You can go read it.
[00:11:47.969 --> 00:11:52.992]  They said we're going to start with cigarettes worldwide and ban them as a model for world government.
[00:11:53.752 --> 00:11:57.999]  But world government by stealth, through local governments, through states, through national governments.
[00:11:59.101 --> 00:12:02.286]  Then we're going to move to low flush toilets, then to light bulbs.
[00:12:02.486 --> 00:12:05.491]  And once we get people to accept things that sound reasonable...
[00:12:06.846 --> 00:12:30.558]  It's going to be no plastic bags, then it's going to be no bags period, then it's going to be no plastic in your house, then it's going to be home inspections, then it's going to be carbon taxes on beef, on anything that has a carbon footprint, flatulence taxes, and it's all going in Europe, Australia, Canada, and now here, and shutting our economy down when China, India, Mexico, and 160 plus third world countries are exempt.
[00:12:30.979 --> 00:12:33.080]  If they're exempt from draconian laws,
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:37.205]  Then it will make the jobs move there immediately.
[00:12:37.546 --> 00:12:43.214]  And guess who owns the major industrial combines in those countries?
[00:12:43.354 --> 00:12:44.496]  You guessed it, the megabanks.
[00:12:45.438 --> 00:12:49.199]  Who have bought control of the planet, or almost have bought control.
[00:12:49.339 --> 00:12:50.380]  They're not in full control yet.
[00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:52.941]  If they get control, Katie, bar the door.
[00:12:53.461 --> 00:12:53.861]  Okay?
[00:12:53.881 --> 00:12:55.022]  They're not in full control yet.
[00:12:55.042 --> 00:13:00.163]  It'll get about, let me be conservative, ten times worse if they were in full control.
[00:13:00.944 --> 00:13:02.945]  They're in about 70%, 75% control right now.
[00:13:03.005 --> 00:13:06.806]  And let me tell you, they're breathing down our neck.
[00:13:06.866 --> 00:13:08.026]  That's why I get so angry.
[00:13:08.807 --> 00:13:10.047]  I mean, I know where this is going.
[00:13:11.648 --> 00:13:13.388]  Where was I going with all this though, overall?
[00:13:13.468 --> 00:13:14.589]  Oh, I was just getting into...
[00:13:16.448 --> 00:13:19.431]  Getting into the whole Agenda 21 police state takeover.
[00:13:19.851 --> 00:13:22.733]  You've got to say no to it because it's so incredibly hellish.
[00:13:22.953 --> 00:13:24.375]  Okay, it's great to be officially back.
[00:13:24.415 --> 00:13:27.878]  I mean, I was back yesterday for the Sunday show, but here we are on the big weekday show.
[00:13:29.018 --> 00:13:31.340]  Let me just try to go over the stacks.
[00:13:32.001 --> 00:13:32.621]  How's that sound?
[00:13:33.963 --> 00:13:37.385]  Let me just start, because I'm trying to figure out what the top story is to me.
[00:13:38.257 --> 00:13:41.180]  I don't just go with whatever the national news top story is.
[00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:44.462]  I go with what I believe the top story is.
[00:13:44.482 --> 00:13:46.584]  Of course, you can tell me what you think is most important.
[00:13:46.864 --> 00:13:51.148]  A lot of times callers call in or we get emails or see comments saying, hey, why didn't you cover this?
[00:13:51.228 --> 00:13:53.690]  And that becomes our top story because I agree with you.
[00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:54.491]  I think it's important.
[00:13:55.672 --> 00:14:01.277]  Homeless Houston veterans cited for dumpster diving in search for food.
[00:14:02.218 --> 00:14:03.779]  That's News 92 FM.
[00:14:03.799 --> 00:14:04.860]  They have a copy of the ticket.
[00:14:06.596 --> 00:14:10.678]  And they've banned feeding the homeless in Houston, so they just say, what do they do, die?
[00:14:10.698 --> 00:14:21.042]  And what a sign of an amazing tyranny when cops will give a homeless person, period.
[00:14:21.422 --> 00:14:28.085]  But I'm telling you, so many of the homeless I see now are not drunks, they're not drug addicts, they're not hobos.
[00:14:29.025 --> 00:14:30.046]  I'll ask them, I'll say,
[00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:34.601]  I mean, a lot of times these guys, you can tell, I mean, are the real deal.
[00:14:35.121 --> 00:14:36.461]  And I'll say, what's your story?
[00:14:36.541 --> 00:14:39.622]  And I don't know what they're going to say.
[00:14:40.202 --> 00:14:42.343]  I was special forces for, you know, 10 years.
[00:14:42.403 --> 00:14:43.563]  I was in the first Gulf War.
[00:14:43.603 --> 00:14:50.324]  I got hit with nerve gas during the nerve gas alert, and I got brain damage now, and I can't get a job.
[00:14:50.364 --> 00:14:53.445]  And you can tell they're all there, but they are damaged.
[00:14:54.585 --> 00:14:56.586]  And, you know, the guy rides off on their bike.
[00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:01.291]  Now I see the homeless and they are injured vets.
[00:15:01.451 --> 00:15:04.252]  I've seen homeless vets with arms and legs blown off.
[00:15:05.912 --> 00:15:11.034]  And I just can't imagine being a cop and coming over to a dumpster and there's a guy and they're eating.
[00:15:11.054 --> 00:15:12.554]  And you're going to give them a ticket.
[00:15:12.634 --> 00:15:13.494]  I mean, man!
[00:15:14.655 --> 00:15:15.295]  Ooh boy!
[00:15:15.315 --> 00:15:20.556]  Let me tell you, I can just, just thinking about that, I can literally pick up on God's anger.
[00:15:21.076 --> 00:15:23.137]  I mean, just inside it makes me shake.
[00:15:24.737 --> 00:15:27.078]  Shake to think to be one of those people.
[00:15:29.201 --> 00:15:30.021]  It makes me shake.
[00:15:32.382 --> 00:15:33.262]  It makes me shake.
[00:15:36.703 --> 00:15:40.104]  And again, this isn't even about, I'm a guy on a high horse, I'm a good guy.
[00:15:40.524 --> 00:15:44.745]  It makes me feel bad to even imagine that.
[00:15:44.945 --> 00:15:47.906]  And that's nothing on the scale of evil, it's just imagine that.
[00:15:47.986 --> 00:15:51.146]  Okay, see I said I'd try to, okay, that's one of the articles.
[00:15:51.826 --> 00:15:53.787]  They're all up at InfoWars.com, or most of them are.
[00:15:55.294 --> 00:15:59.696]  Former Newark Airport TSA screener says the job does little to keep flyers safe.
[00:15:59.736 --> 00:16:00.016]  Really?
[00:16:00.036 --> 00:16:00.936]  They're training you to be a slave?
[00:16:01.196 --> 00:16:04.798]  TSA allowed people with criminal records to get airport security badges.
[00:16:04.838 --> 00:16:05.818]  New American Magazine.
[00:16:06.298 --> 00:16:07.319]  Michael Tennant.
[00:16:07.339 --> 00:16:10.860]  Or is that Michelle Tennant?
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:11.720]  I'm reading from a distance.
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.141]  And the article breaks down all the admitted cases where they hired felons.
[00:16:15.602 --> 00:16:16.582]  Rapists, robbers.
[00:16:17.302 --> 00:16:19.923]  And the thing is, they're not letting them slip through.
[00:16:20.763 --> 00:16:22.004]  It's not an accident.
[00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:25.751]  They do it on purpose.
[00:16:26.431 --> 00:16:31.815]  Again, if you're really worried about real terrorists that are going to attack, why do they then let basically anybody work at an airport?
[00:16:32.056 --> 00:16:33.517]  Because that's who they want.
[00:16:33.777 --> 00:16:37.840]  In the ads they say, we want you to be imperious and dominating.
[00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:38.961]  Remember that ad out of Seattle?
[00:16:39.581 --> 00:16:40.822]  Put out by the TSA?
[00:16:41.363 --> 00:16:42.003]  Dominating.
[00:16:42.303 --> 00:16:42.884]  Imperious.
[00:16:42.964 --> 00:16:46.086]  Imperious means arrogantly imperial.
[00:16:49.028 --> 00:16:49.909]  That's what's going on.
[00:16:54.514 --> 00:16:55.394]  There's another article.
[00:16:55.514 --> 00:16:57.235]  Second drone spotted over New York.
[00:16:57.275 --> 00:17:01.396]  Speaking of New York, UAV reported within three miles of LaGuardia Airport.
[00:17:02.597 --> 00:17:03.777]  They've already had them crash.
[00:17:03.877 --> 00:17:05.898]  They've already had them almost run into airplanes over Denver.
[00:17:06.078 --> 00:17:09.039]  That's Top Drudge link left-hand side, DrudgeReport.com right now.
[00:17:10.179 --> 00:17:11.840]  So, we've now covered three articles now.
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:13.621]  Let's continue to try to get into more.
[00:17:15.201 --> 00:17:20.163]  This one, I'm going to cover this now at about 40 after or so, because I'm getting behind.
[00:17:22.034 --> 00:17:27.816]  I mentioned this yesterday just as a side issue and realized how wild it sounded, because 2013 is wild.
[00:17:27.836 --> 00:17:31.718]  1950 was wild too, I'm gonna tell you in a minute.
[00:17:32.498 --> 00:17:33.898]  Immortal cell line.
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:38.200]  And guess what's immortal?
[00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:40.061]  These are cells that do not die.
[00:17:40.621 --> 00:17:44.863]  They just sit there in a petri dish, replicating forever.
[00:17:45.863 --> 00:17:49.084]  And there's only one kind of cell, and it's very rare in cancer.
[00:17:50.225 --> 00:17:50.965]  It's cancer cells.
[00:17:52.722 --> 00:18:13.008]  And when I talk about this, people say, oh, you got this from the latest installment of the movie, I Am Legend, which was then turned into the film, The Last Man on Earth, with Vincent Price, which is an excellent, classic, high art, in my opinion.
[00:18:14.609 --> 00:18:18.030]  You're going to think that the movie that came out a few years ago, I Am Legend,
[00:18:19.616 --> 00:18:21.978]  You're going to think, wait, you got this from I Am Legend.
[00:18:22.038 --> 00:18:22.638]  No, I didn't.
[00:18:23.879 --> 00:18:24.500]  No, I didn't.
[00:18:28.123 --> 00:18:47.358]  Twenty years ago, they put out, more than twenty years ago, they put out white papers that are public, and I'm going to go over some of them, where they knew that the key to immortality in their belief, this is the establishment, if you control trillions, you're worth billions, you've had every sex
[00:18:48.803 --> 00:18:52.224]  You can imagine, you've got everything, you own mountaintops, jet copters.
[00:18:52.524 --> 00:18:53.185]  What do you want?
[00:18:53.545 --> 00:18:54.825]  What's the one thing you want?
[00:18:55.585 --> 00:18:56.166]  More life.
[00:18:57.106 --> 00:18:59.827]  What does Roy Batty tell the head of the Tyrell Corporation?
[00:19:00.667 --> 00:19:02.328]  I want more life.
[00:19:03.428 --> 00:19:04.469]  And then adds an expletive.
[00:19:06.169 --> 00:19:07.209]  Ah, the facts of life.
[00:19:10.291 --> 00:19:13.052]  What has been already made and cannot be unmade.
[00:19:15.412 --> 00:19:16.953]  Well, not if you're undead.
[00:19:19.175 --> 00:19:20.576]  But it's not even undead.
[00:19:20.677 --> 00:19:22.578]  You will be a living cancer.
[00:19:22.719 --> 00:19:35.992]  And, you know, I talked about this more than a decade ago, and then I went with some friends a while back and saw the latest Resident Evil, because I'd read about the plot, and it's a super cancer virus that makes you basically immortal.
[00:19:36.672 --> 00:19:38.014]  Unless you, you know, get burned up.
[00:19:40.337 --> 00:19:46.624]  And then I realized, I went back and did some research, because I remembered this, that this was all in the literature from the 50s.
[00:19:47.124 --> 00:19:54.031]  Now codified by the early 90s, where they're gonna, well, just wait till I get to this.
[00:19:54.992 --> 00:19:56.914]  Okay, just wait till I cover this.
[00:19:57.855 --> 00:19:59.697]  It's coming up in about 40 after, we'll be right back.
[00:20:01.738 --> 00:20:05.819]  Now there's an amazing new natural antibiotic every person must have!
[00:20:06.099 --> 00:20:12.721]  It's Cells Alive Silver Solution, and it destroys over 650 hard-to-kill viruses, fungus, bacteria, and much more.
[00:20:12.901 --> 00:20:20.343]  Cells Alive Silver Solution has no expiration date, is great for emergency kits and storage shelters, and comes in 8 or 16 ounce bottles.

[00:20:31.246 --> 00:20:40.512]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:20:40.572 --> 00:20:41.293]  This capitalism?
[00:20:41.353 --> 00:20:47.517]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:20:47.637 --> 00:20:48.397]  Hi, Ted Anderson.

[00:22:24.213 --> 00:22:25.654]  Remember last year's dry conditions?

[00:23:12.554 --> 00:23:18.642]  Federal and state and local officials saying help is on the way, while the folks here in Bell Harbor say show me.
[00:23:18.922 --> 00:23:21.243]  Don't depend on the government to save you.

[00:23:53.397 --> 00:23:55.758]  MyPatriotsApply.com.
[00:23:56.158 --> 00:23:57.798]  MyPatriotsApply.com.
[00:24:08.809 --> 00:24:11.091]  In 1814, we took a little trip.
[00:24:11.191 --> 00:24:14.613]  But nowadays, people think you can't stand up for anything.
[00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:37.601]  The establishment tells you you're going to lose.
[00:24:37.641 --> 00:24:38.842]  Resistance is futile.
[00:24:38.882 --> 00:24:39.742]  He must give in to us.
[00:24:45.788 --> 00:24:46.909]  We're going to open the borders.
[00:24:46.949 --> 00:24:48.150]  We're going to take your kids.
[00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:49.571]  We're going to socialize things.
[00:24:49.991 --> 00:24:51.833]  We're going to force inoculations on you.
[00:24:51.873 --> 00:24:53.314]  We're going to make you eat GMO.
[00:24:54.094 --> 00:24:56.196]  We're going to geo-engineer the skies.
[00:24:56.596 --> 00:24:59.078]  We're going to get rid of your national sovereignty.
[00:24:59.098 --> 00:25:01.140]  We're going to put your military under NATO control.
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:04.422]  We're going to tell you what kind of toilet and light bulbs you can have.
[00:25:04.462 --> 00:25:07.444]  We're going to tell you 60% taxes isn't enough.
[00:25:08.305 --> 00:25:09.626]  We're going to make the public dependent.
[00:25:09.806 --> 00:25:10.907]  No, you're not!
[00:25:11.267 --> 00:25:12.668]  We're going to ban your free speech.
[00:25:12.768 --> 00:25:13.449]  No, you're not!
[00:25:16.308 --> 00:25:19.450]  You've got to find the fight in you, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:19.571 --> 00:25:23.113]  And what's incredible is, most of the time when you stand up, you have victory.
[00:25:23.294 --> 00:25:33.642]  In fact, at the bottom of the next hour, David Knight and Jakari Jackson shot a piece at the Alamo reenactment, and then they were banning our free speech in Austin, or trying to order the police to do it.
[00:25:33.702 --> 00:25:36.003]  We learned there was a police revolt.
[00:25:37.064 --> 00:25:38.045]  I didn't hear this from the police.
[00:25:38.085 --> 00:25:38.685]  I learned it from CBS.
[00:25:38.705 --> 00:25:43.047]  I wonder if all the cops were smiling at me when I showed up to demonstrate against the South by Southwest.
[00:25:43.567 --> 00:25:46.669]  And then I later talked to CBS and they had all the big sheets from the interview.
[00:25:46.689 --> 00:25:54.613]  I don't think it even aired, though, where they talked to the cops and the cops said, well, we made the determination that the ordinance does not say that they can't hand stuff out.
[00:25:56.554 --> 00:26:02.557]  Big fracas, though, because they have the city of Austin come down with code enforcement and try to order the police to give people tickets.
[00:26:02.597 --> 00:26:05.258]  They did give warnings and then say, you know, we're not even doing that.
[00:26:06.389 --> 00:26:26.615]  By the time I got back to Austin, I drove back a day early because of this, I didn't know all this, and I showed up, about a hundred people showed up real quick just off an internet announcement, you know, for an impromptu flash demonstration, and News 8 Austin was out there, a bunch of others were out there, it may have aired, I don't really watch television, so I don't know, I haven't looked it up, but I haven't heard about it, so maybe, did News 8 Austin or CBS cover it?
[00:26:27.076 --> 00:26:27.756]  Let's check that.
[00:26:28.536 --> 00:26:30.937]  Then we can type Alex Jones South by Southwest and it'll pop up.
[00:26:31.897 --> 00:26:34.338]  But, I mean, when my crew called me and said,
[00:26:35.836 --> 00:26:42.261]  I'm gonna cover this and show video for TV viewers, audio for radio listeners in about an hour, about an hour and five minutes exactly, middle of the second hour.
[00:26:43.442 --> 00:26:47.285]  They said, the code enforcement's here saying you can't have bumper stickers on your car.
[00:26:47.705 --> 00:26:50.147]  And I said, let me talk to them next time they come up with the cops.
[00:26:50.507 --> 00:26:52.129]  Code enforcement backed up by police.
[00:26:53.309 --> 00:26:58.313]  And I got on the phone with the guy and he's like, my superiors say you can't have this car parked in this parking meter with stickers on it.
[00:26:59.514 --> 00:27:01.055]  And I said, you gotta be kidding me.
[00:27:01.336 --> 00:27:02.457]  This is a joke, right?
[00:27:03.345 --> 00:27:04.787]  And he's like, nope, that's what they're saying.
[00:27:04.927 --> 00:27:05.968]  So we called their bluff.
[00:27:06.008 --> 00:27:06.909]  They had to back off.
[00:27:07.810 --> 00:27:09.532]  And it's this whole thing of their being ordered.
[00:27:09.552 --> 00:27:11.414]  The guy on the phone said he knew it was wrong.
[00:27:11.794 --> 00:27:13.336]  The police said they knew it was wrong.
[00:27:13.576 --> 00:27:14.878]  And then they finally just said no.
[00:27:15.499 --> 00:27:19.843]  What's so wrong about saying no to unlawful orders?
[00:27:20.324 --> 00:27:21.926]  I mean, I just do not get it.
[00:27:22.446 --> 00:27:24.288]  And it's time for the citizens to say no.
[00:27:25.254 --> 00:27:26.135]  No, no, no.
[00:27:26.156 --> 00:27:27.077]  N-O.
[00:27:27.097 --> 00:27:27.137]  No.
[00:27:27.397 --> 00:27:29.420]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:32.364]  You need to learn that word.
[00:27:32.705 --> 00:27:33.546]  Three-year-olds know it.
[00:27:33.806 --> 00:27:34.447]  We need to learn it.
[00:27:34.808 --> 00:27:35.008]  No.
[00:27:36.178 --> 00:27:36.438]  No!
[00:27:37.239 --> 00:27:42.986]  Because everybody thinks if you just bend over to the government, lie down to the system, start licking their boots, they're going to be nice to you.
[00:27:43.386 --> 00:27:45.789]  They're going to put people in who want to have their boots licked.
[00:27:46.510 --> 00:27:49.593]  Most people in government now still don't want to have their boots licked low level.
[00:27:49.934 --> 00:27:55.039]  High level they do, so they're telling the enforcers to go out and turn us into slaves.
[00:27:56.158 --> 00:28:01.300]  And they're trying to create flowerly threats and scary reasons we should do this.
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:03.160]  In fact, I got to this some yesterday.
[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:04.801]  There's more out on it today.
[00:28:04.821 --> 00:28:08.462]  I'm going to be covering this after we get to more headlines in the next segment.
[00:28:08.642 --> 00:28:11.343]  Boy, big news on the economy, but Max Keiser is coming up on that.
[00:28:11.363 --> 00:28:12.143]  46,609,000 people
[00:28:17.057 --> 00:28:22.060]  on food stamps and now has just gone up the last couple months to $47,791,996.
[00:28:22.521 --> 00:28:28.565]  There's a lot of other supplementals.
[00:28:28.885 --> 00:28:35.550]  If you add in all the forms of county and city supplementals and things, it's more like $80 million or on some form of food assistance.
[00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:37.311]  Unbelievable!
[00:28:37.931 --> 00:28:41.938]  Out of 315 mil, 80-something mil have to have the government feed them.
[00:28:42.298 --> 00:28:44.642]  And God forbid, though, churches try to do it.
[00:28:44.662 --> 00:28:45.864]  That's banned all over the country.
[00:28:46.164 --> 00:28:49.209]  From Houston to Florida, cities, you see that in the news.
[00:28:49.669 --> 00:28:51.793]  And God forbid a veteran climb in a dumpster.
[00:28:53.854 --> 00:29:00.440]  Man, I tell you, in Europe right now, in Spain and in other areas, people are dumpster diving families.
[00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:02.742]  Because, you know, the rich are throwing stuff out.
[00:29:02.762 --> 00:29:04.483]  You know, a pear's got a rothole in it.
[00:29:04.804 --> 00:29:05.905]  The rich people throw that away.
[00:29:05.925 --> 00:29:08.207]  They don't know how to just slice off the rotten part.
[00:29:09.047 --> 00:29:14.012]  And over here, though, they give you tickets or arrest your butt.
[00:29:15.393 --> 00:29:16.654]  Oh, it was picked up by KI.
[00:29:16.714 --> 00:29:19.837]  Pamphlet ordinance not enforced during South by Southwest.
[00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:24.292]  And so they did cover it.
[00:29:26.814 --> 00:29:28.636]  Strangely enough, we're not even in this report.
[00:29:32.559 --> 00:29:35.181]  It's a side issue for national listeners.
[00:29:35.461 --> 00:29:37.543]  It's just it shows how crazy government's gotten.
[00:29:37.863 --> 00:29:38.664]  So they did cover it.
[00:29:39.665 --> 00:29:40.425]  But they went to the cops.
[00:29:40.466 --> 00:29:41.727]  The cops said, we're not enforcing that.
[00:29:42.047 --> 00:29:43.448]  Well, you'd already given out tickets.
[00:29:43.888 --> 00:29:46.510]  And I gave KI a copy of the warning ticket.
[00:29:46.751 --> 00:29:48.132]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:48.172 --> 00:29:50.274]  Stand up or be a slave.
[00:29:51.124 --> 00:29:54.106]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.047 --> 00:29:57.729]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.185 --> 00:30:05.228]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms.
[00:30:05.588 --> 00:30:11.053]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[00:30:11.633 --> 00:30:14.836]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?
[00:30:15.517 --> 00:30:16.798]  Check out SimpliSafe.

[00:31:11.913 --> 00:31:17.915]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:31:18.035 --> 00:31:28.819]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.

[00:32:05.754 --> 00:32:06.674]  Tyranny is here.
[00:32:07.014 --> 00:32:10.575]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:32:10.876 --> 00:32:13.156]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:32:13.176 --> 00:32:18.618]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:32:19.038 --> 00:32:25.320]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:31.262]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:32:31.682 --> 00:32:35.383]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:32:35.863 --> 00:32:39.847]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:32:40.147 --> 00:32:45.652]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:32:46.093 --> 00:32:49.096]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:32:49.656 --> 00:32:51.078]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:32:51.618 --> 00:32:52.139]  It's here.
[00:32:52.739 --> 00:32:59.566]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:33:02.250 --> 00:33:07.314]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:08.915 --> 00:33:29.229]  Last night I did the dancing, came dancing tonight.
[00:33:30.308 --> 00:33:31.742]  Last night a little dancer.
[00:33:33.075 --> 00:33:36.016]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:33:36.036 --> 00:33:36.896]  to 2 p.m.
[00:33:37.556 --> 00:33:38.976]  Central Standard Time.
[00:33:39.096 --> 00:33:44.217]  We are here, live, back weeknight, 7 o'clock, with InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:33:44.658 --> 00:33:48.038]  You can get 11 memberships for $5.95 a month.
[00:33:48.198 --> 00:33:50.819]  One master membership, create a username, passcode, you can share.
[00:33:50.839 --> 00:33:54.780]  11 people can simultaneously watch the nightly news.
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:56.200]  All that does is pay for the bandwidth.
[00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:57.100]  That's my goal.
[00:33:57.420 --> 00:34:00.301]  We would be 100% on our own platform, but we cannot pay for the bandwidth of
[00:34:01.121 --> 00:34:05.965]  You know, hundreds of millions of views just on YouTube, uh, conservatively every year.
[00:34:06.806 --> 00:34:27.302]  Okay, so, uh, it's members of PrisonPlanet.tv that help pay for the cameras, the infrastructure, the bandwidth, the reporters, the research, to then be able to produce the information, to air select news reports that we produce here on the radio, slash TV, and to transmit it all to you, the members of
[00:34:27.802 --> 00:34:32.487]  PrisonPlanet.tv or InfoWarsNews.com, now 10 years up and running.
[00:34:34.290 --> 00:34:46.844]  And it's all up there, the incredible special reports, the live coverage, the special events, the on-the-road live coverage, all of it, the rant section, the analysis section, it's all there, the e-books, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:34:49.764 --> 00:34:53.185]  Again, that's PrisonPlanet.tv and I want to thank all of you that are members.
[00:34:53.245 --> 00:34:54.666]  If you're not a member, now is the time.
[00:34:54.706 --> 00:34:58.708]  It's less than 55 cents a month per person under the 11 memberships.
[00:34:58.748 --> 00:35:01.509]  It says 10 in the ad, but it's your membership and 10 more.
[00:35:02.169 --> 00:35:03.630]  And that's simultaneous viewers.
[00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:06.831]  Chances are, most people you give it to aren't going to watch it every day.
[00:35:06.871 --> 00:35:08.051]  We wish they would and wake up.
[00:35:08.592 --> 00:35:10.012]  So, you can probably give it to 20 people.
[00:35:10.352 --> 00:35:11.593]  Hey, let's use it in a passcode.
[00:35:12.173 --> 00:35:14.334]  Just make a new one that's only for the site.
[00:35:14.554 --> 00:35:16.855]  Obviously it shouldn't be to your bank account.
[00:35:17.295 --> 00:35:18.475]  So, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:35:18.495 --> 00:35:29.379]  You know, we might try to set it up where it randomly generates some other codes too, but side issue, the establishment does not want you to hear and see this information.
[00:35:29.939 --> 00:35:32.800]  The establishment does not want you to know what's going on.
[00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:40.143]  The establishment has done everything they can to try to discredit what we're saying, what we're talking about, what we're covering here.
[00:35:41.127 --> 00:35:49.175]  In fact, one area in my stack of news, stack after stack after stack, is Forbes.
[00:35:49.255 --> 00:35:53.359]  And I'll cover that in the next hour, saying 1.6 billion bullets, that's today.
[00:35:53.379 --> 00:35:58.024]  We need to have a national discussion about this and the armored vehicles and everything.
[00:35:58.464 --> 00:36:00.426]  Wait a minute, Forbes, you didn't get the memo?
[00:36:01.507 --> 00:36:04.250]  It's over 2 billion now in the last 15-16 months.
[00:36:06.364 --> 00:36:08.025]  And it's all public.
[00:36:08.245 --> 00:36:23.369]  It's federal purchase orders at FedBiz.gov, but you didn't hear CNN, MSNBC, Politico, and Media Matters, the White House Public Operations Office, you know, with all the White House people running it.
[00:36:23.829 --> 00:36:28.190]  You didn't hear them say it doesn't exist and that it's racist.
[00:36:28.590 --> 00:36:29.990]  You're like, what does this have to do with race?
[00:36:30.110 --> 00:36:31.011]  It's racist, okay?
[00:36:31.031 --> 00:36:31.971]  It's racist.
[00:36:32.791 --> 00:36:33.212]  It's racist.
[00:36:33.792 --> 00:36:35.614]  And never mind the giant arms buildup.
[00:36:35.654 --> 00:36:37.736]  And you heard Gibbs, there's no drone program either.
[00:36:38.117 --> 00:36:39.758]  Even though it publicly exists, it doesn't exist.
[00:36:40.659 --> 00:36:41.660]  So they got a big problem.
[00:36:42.581 --> 00:36:47.026]  And this is what I did a video about last week when I was taken off of the family and what I called in about.
[00:36:47.046 --> 00:36:50.249]  There is a major tipping point.
[00:36:50.289 --> 00:36:51.110]  There's the headline.
[00:36:51.331 --> 00:36:53.433]  1.6 billion rounds of ammo for homeland security.
[00:36:53.493 --> 00:36:55.395]  It's time for a national conversation.
[00:37:00.370 --> 00:37:01.651]  Do me a favor and print me that article.
[00:37:01.691 --> 00:37:03.572]  I know I have it in the stack, but I can't find it for some reason.
[00:37:03.592 --> 00:37:05.313]  That's another problem with having so many news articles.
[00:37:05.333 --> 00:37:07.334]  I have like five stacks of gun news here.
[00:37:09.976 --> 00:37:10.997]  Yeah, more than five stacks.
[00:37:12.558 --> 00:37:17.541]  And last week when I got on and was so excited and I was ranting and raving about
[00:37:18.956 --> 00:37:26.858]  The fact that we're in the fight and the fact that we're having an effect and the White House is responding every day to what InfoWars.com is doing.
[00:37:27.499 --> 00:37:30.980]  They're responding every day to what DrudgeReport.com is doing.
[00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:32.820]  And I'm just giving credit where it's due.
[00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:35.401]  And then InfoWars is forcing
[00:37:36.661 --> 00:37:39.986]  All the big neocon hosts who wouldn't cover this are now covering it.
[00:37:40.446 --> 00:37:42.750]  We're taking over the discussion with the truth.
[00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:48.177]  Hey, why'd they buy 2,700 giant black wheeled tanks that say U.S.
[00:37:48.217 --> 00:37:51.222]  National Police FEMA on them that we photographed in Austin?
[00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:56.541]  Why are they running checkpoints?
[00:37:56.641 --> 00:38:00.565]  Why are they announcing Brigade Homeland, 300 plus thousand federal troops to be deployed?
[00:38:00.705 --> 00:38:01.486]  That's Army Times.
[00:38:02.106 --> 00:38:03.647]  And they're like, oh, that's not happening.
[00:38:03.668 --> 00:38:04.808]  Let's not have a national discussion.
[00:38:05.169 --> 00:38:08.352]  They are writing hit pieces every day.
[00:38:09.132 --> 00:38:16.058]  The AP's written articles trying to whitewash it that are in hundreds, less conservative, thousands of newspapers and TV stations pick up on AP.
[00:38:16.739 --> 00:38:17.860]  You can't even count them all.
[00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:33.788]  And they're saying it doesn't exist, it doesn't exist, or AP won't be as obvious as Politico or Slate or Media Matters saying it doesn't exist, it's a fake online rumor from an anonymous post.
[00:38:33.848 --> 00:38:34.488]  That's what they say.
[00:38:34.748 --> 00:38:36.809]  AP won't fully destroy themselves.
[00:38:37.049 --> 00:38:39.010]  They say, well, Jones is really wrong.
[00:38:39.511 --> 00:38:43.092]  He's kind of right about $1.6 billion, but $200,000 for this department is no big deal.
[00:38:47.267 --> 00:38:51.868]  And then other outfits are like, it's not 1.6 billion, it's a million bullets were bought by this outfit.
[00:38:52.108 --> 00:38:55.049]  So they'll take one line item and focus in on that.
[00:38:55.730 --> 00:39:08.673]  Ladies and gentlemen, you wouldn't have them running around like chickens with their heads cut off, doing the dangerous tactic of saying none of this exists, if it wasn't really dangerous for them.
[00:39:09.774 --> 00:39:11.194]  How do you know the enemy's weak spot?
[00:39:11.254 --> 00:39:13.435]  It's when they send their full force to that area.
[00:39:14.468 --> 00:39:25.111]  How do you know where, in the old days, they would have siege engines, even primitive explosives, Chinese had it thousands of years ago, trying to blow up castle defenses.
[00:39:25.591 --> 00:39:27.372]  And they'd have armies attacking from all sides.
[00:39:27.392 --> 00:39:28.412]  They didn't have radios.
[00:39:28.712 --> 00:39:31.133]  You couldn't see the flags over the other side of the castle.
[00:39:31.953 --> 00:39:33.734]  They'd use those to communicate up on hilltops.
[00:39:34.134 --> 00:39:35.755]  How would you know when there was a breach?
[00:39:36.175 --> 00:39:42.897]  When you saw everybody defending this area of the castle turn and start running down towards the other end of the castle, you would say, ah, breach!
[00:39:43.717 --> 00:39:48.559]  You understand, they're not going to tell us when we're hurting them badly, except by their actions.
[00:39:48.979 --> 00:40:01.483]  And when they're going, there are no bullet purchases, there are no armored vehicles, there are no checkpoints, there are no military drills, there are no black helicopters, and you're like, well, there was a big black helicopter drill in my town.
[00:40:01.843 --> 00:40:03.183]  They practiced taking over the Capitol.
[00:40:03.844 --> 00:40:06.264]  Yeah, they practiced stopping your local government.
[00:40:06.945 --> 00:40:10.966]  They're practicing a Civil War federal takeover, which is a global takeover.
[00:40:12.110 --> 00:40:16.735]  And they don't want to have a national debate about this before they nuke a major city and blame it on the patriots.
[00:40:17.035 --> 00:40:20.679]  They want to nuke the city or release a bioweapon or blow up a federal building.
[00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:21.500]  I hope it's something small.
[00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:22.201]  I hope it's nothing.
[00:40:22.722 --> 00:40:23.523]  And then blame us.
[00:40:25.144 --> 00:40:27.227]  And so this is so paramount.
[00:40:27.267 --> 00:40:28.768]  This is so off the chart.
[00:40:28.848 --> 00:40:30.110]  This is so important.
[00:40:32.978 --> 00:40:43.544]  That mainstream media, not all of them are bad, and those that still want credibility, and those that also want subscribers and readers, because you know, telling the truth also is successful.
[00:40:44.264 --> 00:40:46.085]  People are running from lies quickly.
[00:40:46.526 --> 00:40:51.348]  So you're basically killing yourselves, the mercenaries at CNN, the mercenaries at MSNBC.
[00:40:52.549 --> 00:41:02.856]  The mercenaries at Politico, the mercenaries at Media Matters, who's publicly run by the former White House transition chief and about, what, 30-something other top Obama people.
[00:41:03.096 --> 00:41:04.317]  I mean, it is the White House.
[00:41:04.757 --> 00:41:06.218]  And who are they attacking every week?
[00:41:06.658 --> 00:41:09.120]  Alex Jones, Matt Drudge, the list goes on and on.
[00:41:11.138 --> 00:41:17.004]  I mean, their memo came out in Politico two years ago, and Politico spun it and said, oh, it's no big deal.
[00:41:17.044 --> 00:41:21.308]  Yeah, they call for infiltrating and sabotaging media companies from within.
[00:41:21.328 --> 00:41:23.150]  I mean, that's racketeering, folks.
[00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:25.152]  That's spy operations.
[00:41:26.732 --> 00:41:33.455]  You know, it came out in the Daily Mail about the military's practicing infiltrating local governments and buying them off.
[00:41:33.695 --> 00:41:35.075]  They're not practicing that.
[00:41:35.615 --> 00:41:48.620]  I told you about that 14 years ago in Police Day 2000 with video with emergency managers and police chiefs of major cities in Texas on video with me saying special forces tried to buy them off.
[00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:50.321]  This is a long-term program.
[00:41:50.921 --> 00:41:51.662]  Not in drills.
[00:41:52.242 --> 00:41:53.562]  The cover is the drill.
[00:41:53.982 --> 00:41:55.183]  Just like with terror attacks.
[00:41:56.724 --> 00:41:58.347]  And again, it's not our military.
[00:41:58.407 --> 00:42:03.676]  It's criminal groups in control through the special forces level that's even above the generals.
[00:42:03.936 --> 00:42:06.341]  You always hear, yeah, Navy SEALs and Delta Force.
[00:42:07.358 --> 00:42:09.519]  And even Green Berets are above the generals.
[00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:19.805]  Well, yeah, because they now work for criminal offshore conduits that have been taken outside of the command structure because they just fired, what, 11 generals the last three or four months?
[00:42:20.245 --> 00:42:28.309]  The head of CENTCOM, you name it, because they wanted to give help to the ambassador for eight hours while Al-Qaeda, hired by Obama, was killing everybody.
[00:42:29.350 --> 00:42:31.071]  It was the local Benghazi security force.
[00:42:32.008 --> 00:42:33.109]  Anyways, I'm already digressing.
[00:42:33.129 --> 00:43:01.149]  The point is, is that if we have a discussion about this, and it's starting to come out in Forbes and Daily Mail and newspapers everywhere, I mean, the system is saying there are no army drills, there are no black helicopters, there are no federal checkpoints, there are no TSA checkpoints, there are no billion six, now two billion bullets, there are no 2,700 strikers, armored vehicles, there are no, there are no, there are no, there are no, there are no, there are no, there are no, there are no, there are no, there are no.
[00:43:02.611 --> 00:43:04.853]  That is basically self-immolation.
[00:43:04.893 --> 00:43:08.436]  They have set themselves on fire to light the way for other liars.
[00:43:09.077 --> 00:43:11.239]  In just desperate all-out hoaxes.
[00:43:11.459 --> 00:43:25.091]  This is like 12 hours into the Tet Offensive, there's a full-out attack by North Vietnam against the South, overrunning positions, killing people, burning cities everywhere, and the news is saying there is no Tet Offensive, there is no Tet Offensive, there is no Tet Offensive.
[00:43:25.552 --> 00:43:28.714]  And the psych warfare chiefs publicly talk about this,
[00:43:29.793 --> 00:43:35.395]  They say it doesn't matter if you know it's a lie, it's just meant to make you not take action, and then have a debate about the lie.
[00:43:38.656 --> 00:43:47.979]  You see, because it's targeting the general dumbed-down public that just goes, well Alex was saying they were planning this, but we don't know if it's true, because you won't go look it up on the Federal Purchase Order website that we linked to.
[00:43:49.397 --> 00:44:03.331]  But what I'm saying is, and Joseph Goebbels wrote about this, and then I read some declassified CIA stuff from the 60s where they said, in third world countries we can't be over the top, as Joseph Goebbels pointed out, but also Bernays, they talk about him, he was still advising them at that point.
[00:44:03.951 --> 00:44:07.435]  The problem is, is that when it's too over the top you lose everything.
[00:44:07.935 --> 00:44:12.200]  So, there was an internal fight about how ridiculous to be.
[00:44:13.737 --> 00:44:18.919]  And what's taken the floor in the last 20 years is what Karl Rove talked about eight years ago in the New York Times.
[00:44:18.959 --> 00:44:22.981]  He said, it doesn't matter if we get caught torturing and that we publicly ordered it.
[00:44:23.281 --> 00:44:28.343]  We'll just say that we didn't order it, even though we publicly ordered it, because we control reality.
[00:44:28.563 --> 00:44:32.124]  And he said this to the Washington Post, New York Times, and others at a cocktail party.
[00:44:32.504 --> 00:44:34.725]  They were so scared of him, it took them three years to admit it was him.
[00:44:34.785 --> 00:44:35.625]  They all wrote about it, though.
[00:44:35.645 --> 00:44:38.006]  Everybody knew who it was, senior White House advisor.
[00:44:39.447 --> 00:44:41.007]  And he said, you'll do what you're ordered.
[00:44:41.508 --> 00:44:42.448]  I control reality.
[00:44:44.423 --> 00:44:47.204]  And even the arrogant sellout mercenaries didn't like that.
[00:44:47.504 --> 00:44:51.145]  They want to feel important and like they're controlling reality and lying to people.
[00:44:51.365 --> 00:44:56.586]  They didn't like him saying, I will tell you what to say and you will repeat it.
[00:44:56.927 --> 00:44:57.907]  You understand that?
[00:45:00.348 --> 00:45:05.229]  And so they, and some of them got in trouble, by the way, because, you know, he's like, this is off record.
[00:45:06.049 --> 00:45:09.472]  But you can't have it off record when you're bragging at a cocktail party.
[00:45:09.492 --> 00:45:14.237]  I think they said six senior newspaper people are all around him and he goes, you people are nothing.
[00:45:14.858 --> 00:45:17.140]  I'll tell you the sun didn't come up tomorrow and you'll believe it.
[00:45:17.821 --> 00:45:18.582]  Go read the quotes.
[00:45:20.376 --> 00:45:21.577]  What did Robert Gibbs say?
[00:45:21.597 --> 00:45:23.378]  You know, I said I'd cover the virus news.
[00:45:23.418 --> 00:45:25.440]  I'll do that at the bottom of the next hour because it's so important.
[00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:26.401]  I don't do this on purpose.
[00:45:26.421 --> 00:45:29.263]  You know, I go, I'm just coming up and I don't, you know, I got so much here to cover.
[00:45:29.283 --> 00:45:35.628]  And I want to go to your calls first the next hour and then get to that and then get to the Alamo report and a lot of other big stuff ahead of Max Keiser.
[00:45:36.809 --> 00:45:38.830]  It's just that this is such a big deal.
[00:45:39.251 --> 00:45:41.072]  That's why I start hyperventilating over this.
[00:45:42.713 --> 00:45:46.176]  It is such a big deal, not in a personal power trip.
[00:45:46.216 --> 00:45:47.197]  It's actually pretty creepy.
[00:45:48.285 --> 00:45:53.247]  I don't want him to give me cancer, I don't want him to blow my head off, or kill me and throw me in a hotel room with a hooker.
[00:45:53.607 --> 00:45:54.888]  I mean, I know who these people are.
[00:45:55.908 --> 00:46:01.430]  My best shot is to be as public as I can, to put all the info out now, so there's no point in killing me and turning me into a martyr.
[00:46:01.751 --> 00:46:06.032]  I hope you guys agree with that logic out there listening, the establishment.
[00:46:06.693 --> 00:46:09.574]  I'm not looking forward to you killing me, but if that happens, that's the way it is.
[00:46:10.394 --> 00:46:11.915]  I'm into this, you know, I'm committed.
[00:46:12.776 --> 00:46:14.417]  Because I'm just into the human species.
[00:46:14.457 --> 00:46:20.879]  I'm into my children's future and it's just my male instinct to defend the truth is so over-driving I can't stop.
[00:46:21.379 --> 00:46:22.180]  But side issue.
[00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:25.661]  It's really living is what it is.
[00:46:26.181 --> 00:46:27.281]  The truth is what matters.
[00:46:27.381 --> 00:46:28.282]  I worship the truth.
[00:46:28.882 --> 00:46:30.143]  Because who is the author of truth?
[00:46:30.783 --> 00:46:31.423]  God is truth.
[00:46:32.924 --> 00:46:33.764]  The devil is lies.
[00:46:35.916 --> 00:46:37.982]  I want the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth.
[00:46:38.103 --> 00:46:43.297]  I would rather know the horrible truth and make preparation for it, to quote Patrick Henry, than to just be delusional.
[00:46:47.228 --> 00:46:48.849]  So understand what's happening now.
[00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:50.030]  They've gotten to the point.
[00:46:50.050 --> 00:46:50.951]  They're listening right now.
[00:46:50.991 --> 00:46:51.692]  They admittedly listen.
[00:46:51.712 --> 00:46:54.674]  The White House, through Media Matters, listens, records the show every day.
[00:46:55.535 --> 00:46:58.958]  They've talked about their national studies they've done of the show, where they have three people.
[00:46:59.438 --> 00:47:03.382]  You can go read this in their research reports they file, how they come up with it.
[00:47:03.602 --> 00:47:05.343]  How many times this website links to us.
[00:47:05.683 --> 00:47:06.904]  How many times I say this.
[00:47:07.799 --> 00:47:11.484]  They have three full-time paid people in DC.
[00:47:11.504 --> 00:47:12.626]  They also have a New York office.
[00:47:13.067 --> 00:47:20.698]  Three people listening right now to take stuff out of context and play clips on their website and tell people it's not true.
[00:47:21.926 --> 00:47:35.400]  And they're sitting there, destroying their own future, drinking sodium fluoride, laughing about it, frying their brains with cell phone radiation, eating GMO because they're delusional that they're at the White House, they're little agents.
[00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:38.983]  Oh yeah, how'd I get off into the CIA infiltration of local government?
[00:47:39.764 --> 00:47:45.090]  Whenever that Media Matters memo came out a few years ago about we're going to infiltrate alternative media and destroy it from within,
[00:47:46.752 --> 00:47:47.433]  I mean, that's criminal.
[00:47:48.274 --> 00:47:50.216]  But Politico was like, oh, isn't this cute?
[00:47:50.576 --> 00:47:51.317]  Isn't this fun?
[00:47:51.337 --> 00:47:53.159]  Because they want the White House access.
[00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:57.244]  And a few weeks ago, they said one thing about Obama, saying he was the puppet master.
[00:47:57.444 --> 00:48:01.108]  And so for a few weeks, they were shut off from information and press conferences.
[00:48:01.328 --> 00:48:04.412]  And so they groveled and came out and said, there are no bullets.
[00:48:04.993 --> 00:48:05.573]  They actually said,
[00:48:06.354 --> 00:48:07.855]  Paul Watson wrote about it in a link to their article.
[00:48:08.055 --> 00:48:08.875]  There are no bullets.
[00:48:09.755 --> 00:48:18.218]  Like the New York Times said four years ago, they said, I was in the Chantilly, Virginia Marriott Woods having a full-on hallucination.
[00:48:18.258 --> 00:48:18.658]  Go read it.
[00:48:18.978 --> 00:48:20.559]  There was no Bilderberg meeting.
[00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:24.360]  We force people to admit there's a Bilderberg group.
[00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:25.761]  The media starts to cover it.
[00:48:25.781 --> 00:48:26.681]  What's the New York Times do?
[00:48:26.941 --> 00:48:27.761]  There is no Bilderberg.
[00:48:28.061 --> 00:48:29.382]  Alex Jones is completely insane.
[00:48:30.982 --> 00:48:32.903]  And people read the New York Times and feel official.
[00:48:33.563 --> 00:48:34.804]  They're laughing at you.
[00:48:35.618 --> 00:48:36.299]  They're laughing.
[00:48:36.439 --> 00:48:37.220]  There are no drones.
[00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:38.060]  There is no Bilderberg.
[00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:38.741]  There are no bullets.
[00:48:38.941 --> 00:48:40.042]  There are no armored vehicles.
[00:48:40.082 --> 00:48:42.425]  The TSA... Remember the TSA three years ago?
[00:48:42.925 --> 00:48:48.391]  When we really pushed the big TSA story into the big national spotlight for about three, four months?
[00:48:49.984 --> 00:49:02.372]  And every day Drudge was linking to new articles we had, and they were saying, we do not grope children, we do not go in pants, we do not take you to a secondary room, we do not grope you, we do not strip search, and then they would get caught doing it and say, okay, we do.
[00:49:02.913 --> 00:49:04.274]  We do not save naked images.
[00:49:04.514 --> 00:49:05.855]  The scanners don't have radiation.
[00:49:06.035 --> 00:49:06.995]  They've been fully tested.
[00:49:07.256 --> 00:49:08.496]  Congress has been given the evidence.
[00:49:08.636 --> 00:49:09.317]  None of that was true.
[00:49:09.717 --> 00:49:10.117]  Lies!
[00:49:10.418 --> 00:49:10.818]  Lies!
[00:49:11.118 --> 00:49:11.538]  Lies!
[00:49:11.859 --> 00:49:12.279]  Lies!
[00:49:12.579 --> 00:49:12.999]  Lies!
[00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:13.960]  Lies!
[00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:16.462]  Let's come back in with ministry in the next segment if we can.
[00:49:17.555 --> 00:49:22.886]  Lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies.
[00:49:23.247 --> 00:49:26.393]  And the fact is, when they're attacking us...
[00:49:28.024 --> 00:49:34.846]  And when they are going after us, and when they are saying we're liars, folks, they're not attacking us.
[00:49:34.926 --> 00:49:37.347]  It's a big deal to attack and to give us attention.
[00:49:37.947 --> 00:49:47.671]  They're doing it out of total desperation, because if the public finds out they've built over 200 FEMA camps in the civilian inmate labor camp program, army.mil, look it up.
[00:49:47.971 --> 00:49:48.711]  I just gave you the name.
[00:49:49.712 --> 00:49:50.292]  Just type it in.
[00:49:50.372 --> 00:49:51.172]  Five seconds, you'll have it.
[00:49:51.792 --> 00:49:53.433]  Civilian inmate labor camp program.
[00:49:54.315 --> 00:49:56.117]  The Emergency Centers Establishment Act.
[00:49:56.698 --> 00:49:58.000]  The Clergy Response Team.
[00:49:58.440 --> 00:49:59.482]  The Insregard Teams.
[00:49:59.722 --> 00:50:00.883]  Read the public manuals.
[00:50:01.644 --> 00:50:03.307]  Training for total takeover.
[00:50:03.347 --> 00:50:04.508]  I'm giving you all the names here.
[00:50:05.289 --> 00:50:06.831]  Where you can read the whole takeover plan.
[00:50:07.772 --> 00:50:08.894]  How do I know what's going to happen next?
[00:50:08.954 --> 00:50:09.635]  It's all blueprinted.
[00:50:10.868 --> 00:50:18.673]  It's like if I had the blueprints for a house my neighbor's building, and I'm going to go, yes, next, honey, they're going to build the second floor balcony, and then they're going to put in the pool area.
[00:50:18.873 --> 00:50:20.834]  She's like, how do you know they're building the balcony today?
[00:50:21.134 --> 00:50:21.955]  Well, I had the blueprints.
[00:50:22.255 --> 00:50:23.796]  It said, next thing's that.
[00:50:24.636 --> 00:50:25.517]  It's a TV guide.
[00:50:25.537 --> 00:50:28.199]  How do you know the Super Bowl's coming on tonight?
[00:50:29.459 --> 00:50:30.320]  Well, I have a TV guide.
[00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:31.260]  It's online.
[00:50:31.300 --> 00:50:32.721]  It says it's coming on at 6 o'clock tonight.
[00:50:34.062 --> 00:50:34.843]  My gosh, you're so smart.
[00:50:37.329 --> 00:50:39.010]  I mean, that's what's so frustrating.
[00:50:39.070 --> 00:50:42.511]  So they're there telling you, you know, the Super Bowl isn't coming on, on the day it's coming on.
[00:50:42.551 --> 00:50:46.373]  I mean, it's happening, and they just want to stall you, stall you, stall you.
[00:50:46.593 --> 00:50:52.336]  But they wouldn't be attacking us saying this wasn't true on dozens of issues if it wasn't hurting them.
[00:50:52.656 --> 00:50:59.780]  And I want to go on hurting them, because they're hurting innocent people worldwide and wrecking our once great republic.
[00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:00.260]  Stay with us.
[00:51:02.412 --> 00:51:05.895]  If you're listening, you know your basic freedoms are being threatened every day.

[00:51:12.241 --> 00:51:14.183]  Now is the time to get prepared.
[00:51:14.383 --> 00:51:17.226]  For years we've told you about our friends at eFoods Direct.

[00:53:30.939 --> 00:53:40.205]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:53:40.265 --> 00:53:41.006]  This capitalism?
[00:53:41.066 --> 00:53:47.210]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:53:47.350 --> 00:53:48.110]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:53:48.151 --> 00:53:51.233]  I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[00:53:51.293 --> 00:53:52.193]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.

[00:53:53.614 --> 00:53:53.954]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:54:01.859 --> 00:54:06.040]  Gentlemen, we have called you together to inform you that we are going to overthrow the United States government.
[00:54:12.122 --> 00:54:14.642]  You still think that jet fuel brought down the World Trade Center?
[00:54:17.763 --> 00:54:19.204]  Does anybody else see a problem here?
[00:54:19.864 --> 00:54:25.045]  If the government has nothing to hide, why are they so afraid to answer a few questions?
[00:54:25.965 --> 00:54:27.946]  This story does not add up.
[00:54:45.567 --> 00:54:46.888]  Infowars.com.
[00:54:47.649 --> 00:54:49.350]  The resistance worldwide.
[00:55:03.842 --> 00:55:05.183]  Lies!
[00:55:06.584 --> 00:55:08.186]  Lies!
[00:55:08.206 --> 00:55:08.626]  Lies!
[00:55:10.567 --> 00:55:11.328]  Lies!
[00:55:11.648 --> 00:55:12.329]  Lies!
[00:55:17.734 --> 00:55:23.758]  I got a message last time I sang along to this that the head of ministry liked it.
[00:55:23.779 --> 00:55:24.599]  We need to get him back on.
[00:55:24.619 --> 00:55:25.280]  We need to try to do that.
[00:55:25.300 --> 00:55:27.401]  I know he was on tour last time, but we tried to get him on.
[00:55:27.421 --> 00:55:28.122]  Let's get him back on.
[00:55:29.343 --> 00:55:31.844]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:55:32.185 --> 00:55:36.448]  Plus, he promised to come back on when 2012 would not be the end of the world.
[00:55:38.970 --> 00:55:39.630]  And he's a good guy.
[00:55:39.650 --> 00:55:43.073]  He also ran down people that have been buying gold, and I said, what do you got all those gold teeth for?
[00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:47.753]  Anyways, we're going to get him back on the broadcast.
[00:55:48.213 --> 00:55:50.294]  Man, I tell you, truth is so much stranger than fiction.
[00:55:51.555 --> 00:55:54.417]  Speaking of, do you still think Jet Fuel brought down the towers?
[00:55:55.638 --> 00:55:57.039]  Look at these stacks of news.
[00:55:57.059 --> 00:55:58.821]  Now, I mentioned some of this yesterday.
[00:55:59.881 --> 00:56:06.006]  By the way, I haven't even gotten into the real top story yet today, because I'm so used to North Korea threatening things.
[00:56:06.646 --> 00:56:10.249]  But I started thinking about it last night and this morning on a metric.
[00:56:11.735 --> 00:56:24.658]  This is like, let's not exaggerate, five times the amount of threats and the seriousness of threats I've ever seen, and it's Kim Jong-un who looked more boyish
[00:56:25.731 --> 00:56:41.568]  Because, you know, his dad had kept him at Swiss boarding schools and things until just a few years ago, who looked all scared and boyish just six months ago, now has that same crazy, demonic, I'm in full power, I can order, you know, young girls strung up and killed like his dad would do.
[00:56:42.677 --> 00:56:47.500]  I mean, his dad did Hellraiser type stuff on record at the seven-story Pleasure Palace.
[00:56:48.420 --> 00:56:49.181]  You can look that up.
[00:56:49.301 --> 00:56:59.287]  He would have planes hijacked to kidnap South Korean and Japanese film stars that would disappear into the North Korean capital, the only place with a
[00:56:59.887 --> 00:57:01.608]  Electricity in the country, basically.
[00:57:02.429 --> 00:57:04.050]  Oh man, the Dennis Rodman thing.
[00:57:04.230 --> 00:57:14.517]  I mean, his evil to get money, and then the vampiric spider so happy to have something they thought was a celebrity to embrace and suck in.
[00:57:16.118 --> 00:57:17.219]  It was truly disgusting.
[00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:22.662]  Truly hard to watch, and I think is a window into the mindset of narcissism.
[00:57:23.023 --> 00:57:27.706]  And look, I was into celebrity a little bit until I was exposed to a bunch of it and found out it was no big deal.
[00:57:29.128 --> 00:57:31.090]  The establishment Hollywood-style celebrity.
[00:57:31.650 --> 00:57:40.478]  They're real people, I think, or celebrities in my own mind who are activists and intelligent people, artists, violinists, guitarists, guitar heroes.
[00:57:40.498 --> 00:57:44.922]  I mean, it's people I admire, but just the all-out worship of it, it's so disgusting.
[00:57:45.583 --> 00:57:49.406]  And North Korea threatens preemptive nuclear strike as U.S.
[00:57:49.846 --> 00:57:51.208]  South begin war games.
[00:57:51.628 --> 00:57:52.609]  They've ended the 1950s armatist
[00:57:55.694 --> 00:57:57.418]  I mean, that's off the chart.
[00:57:58.079 --> 00:58:03.571]  You see, that was a ceasefire in a war that was never ended.
[00:58:03.651 --> 00:58:04.513]  So the war...
[00:58:06.394 --> 00:58:12.999]  That so many of our family members fought in, like my late Uncle Leonard, it is now back on.
[00:58:13.079 --> 00:58:14.380]  So I'm going to be breaking that down.
[00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:16.662]  And we're going to take your phone calls at 800-259-9231.
[00:58:16.682 --> 00:58:17.562]  First time callers today, 800-259-9231.
[00:58:17.582 --> 00:58:19.504]  U.S., South Korea begin military exercises, North ends armistice.
[00:58:28.210 --> 00:58:31.772]  And, uh, threatens to preemptively nuke the United States.
[00:58:32.532 --> 00:58:40.235]  And thanks to Clinton and Donald Rumsfeld, they both work together, they were given missiles that can deliver the systems under Laura Allen Hughes.
[00:58:44.477 --> 00:58:48.239]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:52.225 --> 00:58:55.730]  If you're listening, you know your basic freedoms are being threatened every day.

[00:59:57.086 --> 00:59:59.927]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:06.363 --> 01:00:10.528]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:11.189 --> 01:00:11.990]  You want answers?

[01:00:18.518 --> 01:00:22.562]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.102 --> 01:00:30.107]  Alright folks, Max Keiser on what he believes is going to be a financial implosion by late April is going to be joining us.
[01:00:30.127 --> 01:00:32.769]  He's going to cover Bitcoin and a lot more in the next hour.
[01:00:32.869 --> 01:00:37.712]  I've got a ton of news, special reports this hour, but I promise to take some calls right up front.
[01:00:38.093 --> 01:00:40.294]  I'm going to rant because I've got more I want to say.
[01:00:41.115 --> 01:00:44.838]  A little bit in the next segment about Dennis Rodman, because I've been out of town for a week and haven't really talked about this.
[01:00:45.298 --> 01:00:47.419]  The incredibly disgusting spectacle.
[01:00:48.700 --> 01:00:52.343]  A little bit in the next segment and tie it into North Korea threatening to nuke the United States.
[01:00:52.403 --> 01:00:55.385]  Now the armistice, which was a ceasefire, has ended.
[01:00:55.625 --> 01:01:03.210]  So there's a state of war between the United States and South Korea versus North Korea.
[01:01:03.230 --> 01:01:04.150]  I mean, this is a big deal.
[01:01:04.911 --> 01:01:07.733]  You've got an insane little demon running North Korea.
[01:01:07.753 --> 01:01:10.295]  And as bad as the globalists are, and they are bad,
[01:01:11.643 --> 01:01:13.886]  Um, this guy's what they wish they were.
[01:01:13.966 --> 01:01:16.208]  I mean, these guys can't even get their cars to work.
[01:01:17.169 --> 01:01:19.010]  But they've got a big military to threaten people.
[01:01:19.031 --> 01:01:19.931]  I mean, what a joke.
[01:01:20.672 --> 01:01:22.314]  That's one of the few countries that, um...
[01:01:24.909 --> 01:01:28.111]  Did a total roll-in and carpet bombing of the government would really be a nice thing.
[01:01:28.131 --> 01:01:29.652]  I mean, nothing could be as bad.
[01:01:30.413 --> 01:01:31.273]  Nothing could be as bad.
[01:01:31.293 --> 01:01:42.822]  I mean, I can look in the eyes of their government officials, all crazed and weird sycophantic mental illness, and then some toddling little third-generation dictator moron hugging some burnout nobody.
[01:01:42.842 --> 01:01:45.063]  I was actually in Los Angeles one time.
[01:01:45.083 --> 01:01:47.305]  I'm not gonna even tell the story.
[01:01:47.345 --> 01:01:48.165]  It doesn't even matter.
[01:01:48.485 --> 01:01:50.527]  Dennis Rodman is a complete joke.
[01:01:50.687 --> 01:01:51.928]  No one even wants to be around him.
[01:01:53.325 --> 01:01:54.105]  Bankrupted?
[01:01:54.165 --> 01:01:55.466]  No, that's a bad thing in and of itself.
[01:01:55.506 --> 01:01:56.506]  He's just an idiot.
[01:01:57.506 --> 01:02:00.267]  And it just shows how disconnected North Korea is.
[01:02:01.247 --> 01:02:01.928]  Man, I tell you.
[01:02:03.048 --> 01:02:08.189]  They say Kim Jong-un is just obsessed with Hollywood, and that's all he does is read Hollywood magazines and watch TV all day.
[01:02:08.249 --> 01:02:09.930]  I mean, what an obscenity!
[01:02:11.015 --> 01:02:14.878]  I mean, I would just love, love to get in a room with that guy.
[01:02:14.918 --> 01:02:16.199]  I mean, I would just love it.
[01:02:16.299 --> 01:02:17.300]  Wouldn't you love?
[01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:23.444]  Because I'm not somebody that dreams about beating the hell out of people, but I would love, just let me punch him two or three times.
[01:02:23.525 --> 01:02:24.765]  I guarantee ya.
[01:02:25.606 --> 01:02:26.987]  I'm not going to fantasize here.
[01:02:27.027 --> 01:02:28.909]  Can you imagine an uppercut to that nose, full power?
[01:02:29.309 --> 01:02:32.711]  I mean, just give it absolute, you know, caveman swing.
[01:02:33.272 --> 01:02:34.853]  The nose would completely be off the nose.
[01:02:34.873 --> 01:02:37.155]  It'd be a big, gaping black hole of blood spraying out.
[01:02:37.435 --> 01:02:38.656]  And then right into those teeth.
[01:02:39.136 --> 01:02:39.557]  Bam!
[01:02:40.643 --> 01:02:40.823]  I'm sorry.
[01:03:04.325 --> 01:03:05.466]  Look at the other sycophant.
[01:03:05.747 --> 01:03:06.688]  Who's that weirdo?
[01:03:06.708 --> 01:03:08.389]  I've seen that some comedian or something.
[01:03:08.930 --> 01:03:11.412]  Who's the other guy up there in the middle?
[01:03:12.813 --> 01:03:16.817]  Who's that guy, the other black guy above the crazy psychopath below him?
[01:03:17.818 --> 01:03:18.619]  Who is that guy?
[01:03:19.079 --> 01:03:19.820]  I know that guy.
[01:03:20.581 --> 01:03:21.101]  I've seen him.
[01:03:21.141 --> 01:03:25.025]  I mean, just, just, it's, I've never, this is like hell or something.
[01:03:27.293 --> 01:03:29.395]  And just look at the smile on Kim Jong-un's face.
[01:03:29.435 --> 01:03:31.917]  I mean, let's wipe that off your face, you little ferret.
[01:03:32.377 --> 01:03:33.238]  You little gerbil.
[01:03:34.499 --> 01:03:35.699]  Oh, man, get it off stream.
[01:03:35.779 --> 01:03:36.240]  Get it off.
[01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:37.521]  I'm going to rant in the next segment.
[01:03:37.701 --> 01:03:38.862]  I said I'd take calls this segment.
[01:03:38.882 --> 01:03:39.162]  I didn't.
[01:03:39.402 --> 01:03:40.423]  I'll just come back and talk about it.
[01:03:40.443 --> 01:03:41.103]  I'll go to your calls.
[01:03:43.285 --> 01:03:46.848]  I have an instinct to want to put bad people down.
[01:03:48.872 --> 01:03:50.673]  And I don't do that to sound tough or whatever.
[01:03:50.773 --> 01:03:52.714]  I have a problem just being honest how I feel.
[01:03:53.334 --> 01:03:57.976]  And looking at that punches my buttons really, really bad.
[01:03:59.577 --> 01:04:02.138]  It punches my buttons really, really bad.
[01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:07.381]  And I love the fact Dennis Rodman was thrown out of a bar.
[01:04:07.841 --> 01:04:09.202]  I mean that guy...
[01:04:10.503 --> 01:04:11.183]  Let me tell you, man.
[01:04:11.604 --> 01:04:14.906]  It'd be one thing if he went and was very solemn and was actually an ambassador.
[01:04:14.926 --> 01:04:15.687]  It'd still be a joke.
[01:04:16.647 --> 01:04:18.148]  And said, what you're doing is wrong and everything.
[01:04:18.188 --> 01:04:20.310]  Then I would say, wow, the guy actually did something.
[01:04:20.650 --> 01:04:23.272]  Instead he went and groveled and said he was a great guy and all this.
[01:04:23.532 --> 01:04:26.875]  When the guys, him and his family have like 10 million people's blood on their hands.
[01:04:28.075 --> 01:04:40.044]  And I've read about the confirmed reports about how the lower half class are put in pens as animals and their kids are taken and sent to another camp so there's no family.
[01:04:41.625 --> 01:04:56.098]  And the things they do in the medical experiments and all of it, the dehumanization, I think of the millions of... And the fact that when you look at their officers, they all have the same demonic look in their eye of just craven death worship.
[01:04:56.198 --> 01:04:59.281]  And I just absolutely want to annihilate them.
[01:04:59.301 --> 01:04:59.741]  Don't you?
[01:05:02.404 --> 01:05:08.249]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our immunity and health.

[01:08:06.465 --> 01:08:10.568]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:08:11.289 --> 01:08:12.109]  You want answers?
[01:08:12.870 --> 01:08:13.730]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:14.431 --> 01:08:18.073]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:18.614 --> 01:08:22.677]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:25.185 --> 01:08:31.852]  There's a new article that just went up minutes ago at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:08:31.892 --> 01:08:36.396]  It's titled, The Police Will Protect You, So Turn In Your Guns.
[01:08:36.756 --> 01:08:49.248]  And the Veritas Project, folks that brought down Aker, and we're going to get them back on this week, they've gone around to police stations all over the country and gone in pro-tyranny areas, anti-gun areas.
[01:08:50.009 --> 01:08:55.352]  And they've actually gone in there and said, should I be able to have a gun?
[01:08:55.392 --> 01:08:56.953]  The police openly say no.
[01:08:56.973 --> 01:08:59.615]  No one should be allowed to have a gun except the police.
[01:08:59.955 --> 01:09:01.036]  You need to get a dog.
[01:09:01.476 --> 01:09:05.338]  The same thing that Michael Moore told Luke Radowski of We Are Change.
[01:09:05.378 --> 01:09:14.124]  In fact, we probably should tell Kurt in his article to add a link to that particular We Are Change video because this is a meme.
[01:09:15.831 --> 01:09:16.571]  Get a dog.
[01:09:17.752 --> 01:09:20.454]  Somebody intent on home invading is going to kill your dog.
[01:09:21.694 --> 01:09:30.719]  And the idea that we don't have a right to protect ourselves and that the police are going to do it when they have no statutory directive to do it.
[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:41.165]  I mean, there are some common law failure to render aid, but the cops have exempted themselves even from that to where they're saying they don't have a compulsion to protect you, but I can't protect myself.
[01:09:42.947 --> 01:09:47.369]  I mean, if I lived in Chicago or New York, you better believe I'd have a gun.
[01:09:47.389 --> 01:09:55.493]  I mean, I'm a pretty big guy, and I've had people try to shake me down on the New York subway just to see if I'd be scared and give them my watch.
[01:09:55.573 --> 01:09:57.374]  And I was like, are you really joking, guys?
[01:09:57.394 --> 01:09:58.895]  I was there with a couple other people.
[01:10:00.276 --> 01:10:02.398]  In fact, we actually got in a fight on the New York subway.
[01:10:02.438 --> 01:10:05.740]  I let the guy push me, because I didn't want to go to jail.
[01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:07.202]  It was like 3 in the morning when we were coming back.
[01:10:07.262 --> 01:10:07.702]  Big guy.
[01:10:08.042 --> 01:10:12.626]  And Rob Jacobson, who's not that big, ran up and like pushed the guy really hard and said, come on.
[01:10:12.646 --> 01:10:14.788]  I was just like, let's get out of here.
[01:10:14.848 --> 01:10:18.531]  But again, I'm starting to have flashbacks to stuff in New York.
[01:10:18.551 --> 01:10:21.013]  That was like during the RNC in 2004.
[01:10:22.314 --> 01:10:27.578]  Time certainly flies late at night after being out on the bay doing some video shooting.
[01:10:29.252 --> 01:10:39.581]  But before I go to your phone calls and the toll-free number to join us when the line is open, first-time callers 800-259-9231, let me run over some of the headlines here.
[01:10:40.001 --> 01:10:46.887]  First off, North Korea is constantly threatening to annihilate America and attack South Korea and the rest of it.
[01:10:47.007 --> 01:10:49.349]  It is the ultimate example of why big government's bad.
[01:10:49.989 --> 01:10:51.609]  And why state planning destroys things.
[01:10:52.149 --> 01:11:01.111]  More than 10 million estimated North Koreans have died since the armistice back in the 1950s, 1953.
[01:11:01.831 --> 01:11:02.952]  The war never ended.
[01:11:02.972 --> 01:11:07.173]  There was a ceasefire, or to use the European term, an armistice.
[01:11:07.993 --> 01:11:10.333]  And they have had a ceasefire there with the DMZ.
[01:11:10.733 --> 01:11:13.694]  They have abolished the armistice as of yesterday.
[01:11:14.690 --> 01:11:25.715]  They announced they'd do it Friday, and said we may preemptively launch an ICBM, which they have, thanks to Lore Allen Hughes and helping them get the reactors.
[01:11:26.155 --> 01:11:29.417]  The head of ABB at the time was Donald Rumsfeld, and Clinton authorized it.
[01:11:29.457 --> 01:11:30.657]  So, bipartisan.
[01:11:31.238 --> 01:11:33.298]  Rumsfeld's involved in getting Aspartame approved.
[01:11:33.979 --> 01:11:37.701]  Rumsfeld is involved in Monsanto and the Terminator gene.
[01:11:38.081 --> 01:11:39.681]  I mean, it's like he's the devil.
[01:11:39.721 --> 01:11:42.743]  There's a poof of white smoke, and there's Donald Rumsfeld there.
[01:11:44.588 --> 01:11:49.273]  The point is, is that that's why they now have this and have missiles that keep blowing up the launch pad.
[01:11:50.202 --> 01:11:52.043]  Let me tell you, folks, I've watched how they've blown up.
[01:11:52.623 --> 01:11:58.225]  They've clearly got space-based and aircraft-based lasers that can shoot from hundreds of miles away and blow those things up.
[01:11:58.245 --> 01:11:59.145]  They are blowing them up.
[01:12:00.506 --> 01:12:04.047]  And that's why the White House came out on Saturday and said, we can shoot down those missiles.
[01:12:04.327 --> 01:12:04.987]  Yeah, no kidding.
[01:12:05.628 --> 01:12:13.911]  I mean, they had 30 years ago DC-10s with giant chemical lasers the entire length of the jet aircraft that are like Star Wars.
[01:12:14.011 --> 01:12:17.332]  I mean, particle beam, you're gone.
[01:12:18.032 --> 01:12:19.777]  Shoot right through armor, you name it.
[01:12:19.958 --> 01:12:20.560]  Very powerful.
[01:12:20.821 --> 01:12:22.525]  Regular laser would just bounce off of it.
[01:12:22.606 --> 01:12:23.328]  It's particle beam.
[01:12:24.457 --> 01:12:33.363]  A chemical laser with a cyclotron in it, a small superconducting supercollider, and then they, it's like a rail gun, but it's small particles, and it heats up.
[01:12:33.383 --> 01:12:40.909]  The reason I know is, of all people, my dad got a grant in high school to build a primitive particle beam.
[01:12:40.929 --> 01:12:42.510]  They were handing out things like that then.
[01:12:42.890 --> 01:12:47.714]  He was top of his class, and he built a small particle laser and was blowing stuff up in the backyard.
[01:12:47.814 --> 01:12:48.835]  I can't believe I'm saying this.
[01:12:48.855 --> 01:12:49.595]  It sounds so crazy.
[01:12:49.635 --> 01:12:50.276]  It's actually true.
[01:12:50.996 --> 01:12:53.197]  And he didn't wear the proper safety glasses.
[01:12:53.217 --> 01:12:55.017]  He had welding glasses on, wasn't enough.
[01:12:55.377 --> 01:12:58.078]  Particles went in and his eyes got burned.
[01:12:58.118 --> 01:12:59.398]  He was blind for about three weeks.
[01:12:59.718 --> 01:13:00.559]  Had to wear bandages.
[01:13:00.819 --> 01:13:02.059]  Didn't know he had his eyesight back.
[01:13:02.099 --> 01:13:04.980]  And his eyes went from blue to green.
[01:13:05.780 --> 01:13:06.940]  But it's really burns.
[01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:09.601]  It burned the front of his eye.
[01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:17.202]  And he has like yellow burns on his eye, but I don't know why I'm telling that story now.
[01:13:17.543 --> 01:13:19.904]  Okay, anyways, I'm going to do a special on lasers very soon.
[01:13:19.964 --> 01:13:21.185]  Believe me, it's going to be a viral video.
[01:13:22.445 --> 01:13:23.506]  This has been done for months.
[01:13:23.526 --> 01:13:24.627]  I've got to finish it up.
[01:13:24.647 --> 01:13:26.068]  I mean, we shot the video of the lasers.
[01:13:26.588 --> 01:13:27.528]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[01:13:27.548 --> 01:13:29.970]  I like to have fun.
[01:13:32.011 --> 01:13:33.452]  But let me get back to North Korea.
[01:13:35.919 --> 01:13:43.985]  Here's Paul Craig Roberts' article dealing with trying to start war in the Middle East with people that aren't starting it and putting Al-Qaeda in Libya and Syria and all these areas.
[01:13:44.365 --> 01:13:50.749]  He's got starting Armageddon in the face but hiding it with official lies.
[01:13:50.789 --> 01:13:51.170]  That's right.
[01:13:51.210 --> 01:13:59.635]  It's all about doing it publicly but then openly denying it just to condition you to accept pure lies and then not even know what's true unless you spend time to actually ferret it out.
[01:13:59.896 --> 01:14:01.076]  And then you just try to talk to the
[01:14:02.068 --> 01:14:07.657]  cattle out there who think it's cool who wear their ignorance like an armor they don't want to know.
[01:14:09.542 --> 01:14:10.102]  And so here it is.
[01:14:10.142 --> 01:14:12.703]  North Korea threatens preemptive nuclear strike on U.S.
[01:14:13.483 --> 01:14:15.343]  South begin war games.
[01:14:15.943 --> 01:14:16.724]  South Korea and U.S.
[01:14:16.744 --> 01:14:19.184]  begin military drills as North Korea threatens war.
[01:14:19.644 --> 01:14:21.104]  That's today, AP.
[01:14:22.265 --> 01:14:26.666]  North Korea cuts hotline with South, threatens nuclear strike as war games begin.
[01:14:26.686 --> 01:14:29.906]  And let me tell you, Kim Jong-un is actually in command.
[01:14:29.926 --> 01:14:32.887]  And when you look at how mentally ill his generals are,
[01:14:33.607 --> 01:14:42.334]  Wearing stuff that looks like suits from a hundred years ago, and driving 57 Chevys around, and weirdos crying for two days straight when Kim Jong-il dies.
[01:14:43.095 --> 01:14:44.536]  I mean, this is megalomania.
[01:14:45.217 --> 01:14:52.362]  I mean, Hitler turned into Russia, who'd never been beaten, and went and fought numbers of 5-6-1, when he was already losing in the West.
[01:14:52.683 --> 01:14:53.543]  He got delusional.
[01:14:54.782 --> 01:15:04.848]  And the Germans were about a hundred times less delusional, historically, and thought they might be able to win, and lost millions of soldiers, by the way, and had a more high-tech military.
[01:15:05.288 --> 01:15:10.811]  North Korea's got a bunch of artillery, some old tanks, and a bunch of brainwashed people that'll do whatever they're told.
[01:15:11.432 --> 01:15:12.712]  But it's over, folks.
[01:15:13.153 --> 01:15:14.894]  North Korea actually starts something.
[01:15:16.615 --> 01:15:20.437]  And see, most groups, like Iran, may even be playing a double game with the globalists.
[01:15:21.197 --> 01:15:23.499]  We know in Iran-Contra they made deals with Reagan and others.
[01:15:24.758 --> 01:15:27.359]  And Chavez, there was some double gaming going on.
[01:15:27.759 --> 01:15:29.380]  But with North Korea, I've analyzed it.
[01:15:29.740 --> 01:15:32.462]  China keeps them on a leash, but not a very short one.
[01:15:33.362 --> 01:15:35.463]  And I mean, they're a real wild card.
[01:15:35.523 --> 01:15:42.066]  And it's always been said by analysts that I agree with, like Joel Skousen.
[01:15:42.086 --> 01:15:43.067]  Let's get Joel Skousen on.
[01:15:43.347 --> 01:15:46.448]  Let's get Joel Skousen on tomorrow if we can.
[01:15:47.409 --> 01:15:49.870]  That North Korea will be the trigger for the big one.
[01:15:50.952 --> 01:15:53.054]  And what was Lindsey Williams told three years ago?
[01:15:53.074 --> 01:15:54.234]  He goes, don't worry about the Middle East.
[01:15:54.514 --> 01:15:58.117]  They're going to start a big war, use riots and things to take that down.
[01:15:58.157 --> 01:15:58.777]  That came true.
[01:15:59.077 --> 01:16:00.578]  He has a Bilderberg level source.
[01:16:00.658 --> 01:16:01.539]  I don't even know who it is.
[01:16:01.559 --> 01:16:02.499]  Can't say the name, obviously.
[01:16:03.820 --> 01:16:05.141]  But look for North Korea.
[01:16:05.221 --> 01:16:05.982]  That's the big one.
[01:16:07.102 --> 01:16:19.330]  And right as the global financial collapse is about to accelerate, I mean, I'm not saying this is going to happen, but this is getting close, with them ending the armistice, ending the ceasefire.
[01:16:20.816 --> 01:16:29.357]  And now, briefly, before I go to your calls, I want to talk about the spectacle of Kim Jong-un, the third-generation dictator.
[01:16:30.345 --> 01:16:48.533]  Where there's only power and a few military bases around the country and the main city, and they've got high-tech cat scanners and the best equipment and Colby beef flown in from Japan, and high-priced hookers flown in constantly for them, and even B-movie stars flown in from Japan, South Korea, and the U.S.
[01:16:48.854 --> 01:16:53.516]  to service the every whim of Kim Jong-il, and now his son.
[01:16:54.136 --> 01:16:56.437]  Who showed up whenever he took over the throne.
[01:16:56.457 --> 01:16:56.898]  That's what it is.
[01:16:56.958 --> 01:16:57.478]  It's royalty.
[01:16:57.698 --> 01:16:58.919]  That's why royalty is so despicable.
[01:16:59.099 --> 01:17:01.000]  A couple more generations, they will be wearing crowns.
[01:17:02.901 --> 01:17:08.945]  They show up over there, and when he first got in there, six, seven months ago, or was it a year ago his dad died?
[01:17:09.305 --> 01:17:09.986]  Time flies.
[01:17:11.166 --> 01:17:19.071]  And he was all shell-shocked, looked like the little kid who'd been living in Switzerland, you know, who was fascinated with basketball, the NBA, and movies.
[01:17:19.531 --> 01:17:21.793]  He was like this wide-eyed, the new Supreme Commander.
[01:17:23.197 --> 01:17:41.960]  And now, he has that ha ha ha demonic look, and I watched the video you all saw a week ago, I was out of town, Dennis Rodman hugging him, and them hugging, and Kim Jong Un's a great guy, and it's so much fun, and the sycophantic-ness of a burnout nobody celebrity.
[01:17:43.294 --> 01:18:12.854]  Getting all this, you know, enjoyment and fame off of this, infamy, and Kim Jong Un hugging him, and all the sycophants around them, and the gibbering, and the evil, and people playing basketball, where if you don't do a good job, you're sent to a death camp, and Rodman defending that, and saying he's a wonderful person, and all the psychos, vampires that are starved on their own, defeated people, seeing a fake celebrity there to visit them in their kingdom of shame, is so disgusting, and it gets worse.
[01:18:14.075 --> 01:18:16.198]  Look at how Kim Jong-un operates.
[01:18:17.019 --> 01:18:18.261]  Threatening to nuke everyone.
[01:18:18.301 --> 01:18:19.263]  Threatening to kill everyone.
[01:18:19.423 --> 01:18:20.324]  Just like the globalists.
[01:18:20.645 --> 01:18:22.968]  Do what we say or Al-Qaeda will blow up America.
[01:18:23.973 --> 01:18:25.494]  Big sis ought to marry Kim Jong-un.
[01:18:25.534 --> 01:18:29.597]  She was just saying last week terrorists will attack if you don't give us unlimited homeland security funding.
[01:18:30.618 --> 01:18:32.679]  Holder, give us the guns or more kids will die.
[01:18:32.979 --> 01:18:35.241]  We know you got wind-up toys doing these shootings, buddy.
[01:18:35.261 --> 01:18:37.222]  They're all under government psychiatric care.
[01:18:37.662 --> 01:18:40.044]  One of them was Air Force Run in Colorado.
[01:18:40.064 --> 01:18:43.046]  I mean, we know you're using terror to keep us under control as well.
[01:18:43.526 --> 01:18:46.749]  You just had a richer, more powerful nation to suck off of.
[01:18:47.708 --> 01:18:51.350]  And you've taken our wealth and destroyed it, but you use the same system of control.
[01:18:52.030 --> 01:18:58.833]  And you will debase us down to North Korea level, because it's not just about you having all the power, it's about you watching us suffer.
[01:18:59.473 --> 01:19:06.556]  That's why you want us dependent and under your control, because you're the same diseased, rotting, ugly, demonic filth.
[01:19:06.836 --> 01:19:08.557]  Look at, look at Big Cish.
[01:19:08.877 --> 01:19:09.698]  Look at Obama.
[01:19:09.958 --> 01:19:10.839]  Look at all these people.
[01:19:10.859 --> 01:19:12.440]  And they're just mercenaries for the bankers.
[01:19:12.620 --> 01:19:13.621]  Look at the top bankers.
[01:19:13.981 --> 01:19:23.508]  They are ugly, unhappy, wicked, turned over to evil people who themselves go to celebrity banquets constantly to sit up there like peacocks and be worshipped.
[01:19:23.588 --> 01:19:32.635]  They are empty, soulless, fallen, cancerous people who took over because they're anti-human and don't follow the regular codes that we do.
[01:19:32.855 --> 01:19:34.217]  And that doesn't make them strong.
[01:19:34.457 --> 01:19:35.758]  It makes them degenerate.
[01:19:36.198 --> 01:19:39.500]  And I'm telling you, if I ever see Dennis Rodman, I'm getting in his face.
[01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:41.621]  And I just get nauseous.
[01:19:42.642 --> 01:19:44.123]  Nauseous seeing Kim Jong-il.
[01:19:44.323 --> 01:19:47.885]  But they're an expression of what all mega-tyrants become.
[01:19:48.125 --> 01:19:51.287]  Of what all big government and big corporations creates.
[01:19:52.568 --> 01:19:55.790]  The unaccountability, the thuggish mafia behavior.
[01:19:55.870 --> 01:19:59.392]  And I swear eternal resistance against all of these scum.
[01:19:59.572 --> 01:20:00.493]  We'll be back with your calls.
[01:20:01.952 --> 01:20:06.396]  Nothing is more American than diamond gusset jeans.
[01:20:06.416 --> 01:20:07.537]  100% American made since 1987.
[01:20:09.158 --> 01:20:14.422]  Soft and broken in from the start, yet more rugged and durable than any jean you've ever worn.
[01:20:15.103 --> 01:20:17.745]  Have you ever experienced missized jeans from China?
[01:20:18.105 --> 01:20:19.727]  Well, you won't with diamond gusset.
[01:20:20.307 --> 01:20:24.651]  Every pair is crafted to fit exactly the same and always feel like they were custom made.
[01:20:25.371 --> 01:20:27.271]  Need a 35, 37, or 39 waist?
[01:20:27.331 --> 01:20:29.532]  How about a 31 inseam?
[01:20:30.152 --> 01:20:32.572]  We keep all sizes in stock for the fit you need.
[01:20:33.153 --> 01:20:36.973]  Looking for a relaxed fit, slim fit, regular fit, boot cut, or straight leg?
[01:20:37.413 --> 01:20:38.414]  We got you covered.
[01:20:38.974 --> 01:20:44.215]  Buy the world's best fitting jeans at gusset.com or call 1-888-8GUSSET.

[01:21:02.014 --> 01:21:03.915]  We've lived in this neighborhood for years.
[01:21:04.395 --> 01:21:07.517]  We have an alarm system and all of our doors have deadbolts.
[01:21:07.937 --> 01:21:11.519]  They kicked in our door and were in and out of our house in about 5 minutes.
[01:21:11.899 --> 01:21:17.462]  The police arrived in about 20 minutes, but they were long gone with our TV, jewelry, and my guns.
[01:21:17.802 --> 01:21:20.344]  I kept thinking, what if my family had been home?
[01:21:20.704 --> 01:21:27.668]  The police officer said that more than 85% of break-ins are through a door, and that deadbolts alone don't stop intruders.
[01:21:28.248 --> 01:21:33.713]  The officer told me to go to EasyArmor.net if we wanted something that would actually stop an intruder.
[01:21:34.113 --> 01:21:39.938]  EasyArmor reinforces all of the weak points on your doors and is guaranteed to prevent kick-ins.
[01:21:40.238 --> 01:21:46.003]  I was surprised at how little EasyArmor costs and I installed EasyArmor in about 30 minutes.
[01:21:46.263 --> 01:21:47.724]  Visit EasyArmor.net.
[01:21:47.865 --> 01:21:50.887]  That's the letters E-Z-A-R-M-O-R.net.
[01:21:51.027 --> 01:21:51.908]  Or call 888-58-ARMOR.
[01:21:51.928 --> 01:21:52.449]  That's 888-582-7667.
[01:21:52.529 --> 01:21:53.109]  EasyArmor.net.
[01:21:53.169 --> 01:21:54.551]  Ultimate door security made easy.
[01:22:01.081 --> 01:22:04.223]  Nagging constipation, hemorrhoids, or painful bowel movements?
[01:22:04.483 --> 01:22:06.344]  Have you considered your toilet posture?
[01:22:06.585 --> 01:22:10.207]  The colon needs proper alignment for faster, more effective elimination.
[01:22:10.367 --> 01:22:12.889]  And that's exactly what you'll get with a Squatty Potty.
[01:22:13.129 --> 01:22:18.772]  Not a cleanse or a pill, the Squatty Potty is a healthy step in the right direction, is doctor recommended, and starts at just $34.95.
[01:22:19.793 --> 01:22:24.416]  Call 855-628-1099 or go to squattypotty.com.
[01:22:24.596 --> 01:22:27.718]  Spelled S-Q-U-A-T-T-Y potty dot com.
[01:22:27.918 --> 01:22:28.739]  Squatty Potty.
[01:22:28.859 --> 01:22:30.280]  Healthy colon, happy life.
[01:22:31.138 --> 01:22:32.178]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:32.358 --> 01:22:36.660]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:42.461]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:22:42.561 --> 01:22:45.902]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:22:46.142 --> 01:22:48.703]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:48.823 --> 01:22:53.644]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[01:22:53.784 --> 01:22:54.024]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:54.044 --> 01:22:55.405]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:23:00.646 --> 01:23:02.608]  Hey there, my name is Frank Bates.
[01:23:03.048 --> 01:23:05.750]  Do you know the number one most valuable item in a crisis?
[01:23:06.351 --> 01:23:11.955]  Some people think the answer is gold, others think it's a gun, but the correct answer will shock you.
[01:23:12.495 --> 01:23:20.322]  I just created a free video at Crisis123.com that reveals a surprising item that is more valuable than gold in a crisis.
[01:23:21.362 --> 01:23:24.425]  97% of Americans don't have this one critical item.
[01:23:24.705 --> 01:23:26.546]  In fact, they haven't even given it a thought.
[01:23:26.866 --> 01:23:33.851]  And the sad truth is that you may not survive without it when a real crisis hits and a starving mob is right outside your door.
[01:23:34.352 --> 01:23:38.835]  But I have to tell you, it could literally make the difference between life and death for you and your family.
[01:23:39.332 --> 01:23:45.256]  Watch my video at Crisis123.com to discover the number one most valuable item in a crisis.
[01:23:45.576 --> 01:23:46.357]  You'll be shocked.
[01:23:46.917 --> 01:23:51.641]  See the controversial video that thousands of other smart patrons have already seen in the last three months.
[01:23:52.121 --> 01:23:57.225]  Go watch my video now at Crisis123.com before they force me to shut it down.
[01:23:57.605 --> 01:23:58.966]  Again, that's Crisis123.com.
[01:24:11.345 --> 01:24:27.680]  By the way, they have different types of extreme tourism, shop tourism, where tens of thousands of Americans and Europeans go to North Korea every year, and they post the videos online, and it's to make fun of the starving people, and to get into all the evil, and to pose with the soldiers.
[01:24:29.690 --> 01:24:33.115]  Yeah, there's war terrorism, and it's a big thing with yuppies and trendies.
[01:24:33.195 --> 01:24:34.997]  Another thing is people with beards.
[01:24:35.017 --> 01:24:38.942]  You know, every guy's got a big beard, and they act goofy, and they make jokes.
[01:24:39.423 --> 01:24:45.752]  The archetype is like the guy in that new viral Oreo ad, where you're into the tyranny.
[01:24:45.792 --> 01:24:47.254]  You're into it being a joke.
[01:24:47.694 --> 01:24:49.075]  And that's what they're saying about Ennis Rodman.
[01:24:49.135 --> 01:24:49.695]  It's funny.
[01:24:49.775 --> 01:24:50.275]  It's cute.
[01:24:50.736 --> 01:24:51.836]  Oh, look at Kim Jong-un.
[01:24:51.896 --> 01:24:52.997]  He's a joke.
[01:24:53.477 --> 01:24:58.839]  You go to the comedy stores or costume stores and there's Kim Jong-il tongue cleaners.
[01:24:58.859 --> 01:25:01.401]  You know, it's all funny.
[01:25:01.721 --> 01:25:03.322]  Him chasing young girls on the beach.
[01:25:03.742 --> 01:25:06.723]  That'd be like making jokes out of Hitler, which they now do about it.
[01:25:06.743 --> 01:25:10.445]  It's funny and Holocaust jokes and communist jokes.
[01:25:10.465 --> 01:25:14.907]  They have Mao Zedong restaurants where the trendies go.
[01:25:15.067 --> 01:25:16.528]  He killed 80 plus million people.
[01:25:17.267 --> 01:25:19.728]  They debate 60-something million to 84 million.
[01:25:20.609 --> 01:25:22.870]  The State Department and CIA say 60-something million.
[01:25:22.890 --> 01:25:23.611]  They put him in.
[01:25:23.651 --> 01:25:24.211]  They should know.
[01:25:24.511 --> 01:25:25.812]  The Chinese say 80-something million.
[01:25:26.272 --> 01:25:26.632]  Look it up.
[01:25:27.233 --> 01:25:28.653]  And it's all a big joke.
[01:25:29.954 --> 01:25:31.095]  Yeah, there's a new one.
[01:25:31.115 --> 01:25:34.757]  42% of Austrians think Hitler rule wasn't all bad.
[01:25:35.938 --> 01:25:39.079]  How about your country getting bombed and invaded?
[01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:40.100]  How was that?
[01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:42.321]  20 million Germans died in that war.
[01:25:42.781 --> 01:25:43.942]  Only 2 million of them soldiers.
[01:25:44.222 --> 01:25:45.303]  Didn't go too good for them either.
[01:25:47.130 --> 01:25:49.652]  And again, things are so decadent now.
[01:25:50.353 --> 01:25:51.875]  Yesterday, I walked out of a restaurant.
[01:25:51.895 --> 01:25:54.457]  I went and had a meeting with one of my IT guys after the Sunday show.
[01:25:54.497 --> 01:26:00.903]  We had to have a meeting about some architecture purchases we're going to make, you know, here in the IT architecture.
[01:26:01.984 --> 01:26:02.845]  And I'm walking out.
[01:26:02.985 --> 01:26:05.888]  It's sunset at about 7.15.
[01:26:08.686 --> 01:26:11.868]  And there's a big giant cell tower right there at the restaurant.
[01:26:12.348 --> 01:26:14.289]  Behind it, next to some office buildings.
[01:26:14.790 --> 01:26:15.750]  Or actually on top of it.
[01:26:16.350 --> 01:26:18.872]  And there was signs about don't get close, it says radiation.
[01:26:19.172 --> 01:26:22.274]  So I was shooting a video going, notice they say that it's dangerous, but...
[01:26:24.138 --> 01:26:26.900]  Then if you tell people cell phones will give them cancer, they think you're a kook.
[01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:30.942]  And some woman is in a car parked about 10 feet away, and she starts laughing.
[01:26:31.483 --> 01:26:34.965]  So I turn the camera off, the iPhone off, turn around, and I go, hey, what's going on?
[01:26:34.985 --> 01:26:37.467]  And she's laughing, going, what are you talking about laughing at me?
[01:26:37.487 --> 01:26:38.988]  Because she heard me talking about cancer.
[01:26:39.308 --> 01:26:41.389]  And I went, nothing, it's all funny, isn't it?
[01:26:41.950 --> 01:26:43.951]  And she didn't like that, and her boyfriend didn't like it.
[01:26:44.511 --> 01:26:46.653]  And I could tell they were laughing at us aggressively.
[01:26:47.533 --> 01:26:49.454]  They were laughing to mess up the video shot.
[01:26:49.755 --> 01:26:51.295]  They were like, what are you talking about, huh?
[01:26:51.856 --> 01:26:52.356]  What?
[01:26:54.137 --> 01:26:58.360]  Because, you know, if she'd have been, you know, laughing just because, you know, she was uncomfortable, I would have explained it to her.
[01:26:58.660 --> 01:27:03.423]  She was like, what?
[01:27:04.103 --> 01:27:05.464]  And I was like, oh, no, everything's fine.
[01:27:05.544 --> 01:27:06.265]  Nothing, nothing.
[01:27:06.325 --> 01:27:06.945]  It's good for you.
[01:27:07.165 --> 01:27:07.906]  Government loves you.
[01:27:07.946 --> 01:27:09.086]  And she went, huh?
[01:27:09.947 --> 01:27:11.428]  And then started her car and drove off.
[01:27:12.406 --> 01:27:20.470]  So I shot another video that you can see that's up at InfoWars.com that has a nice title for everybody.
[01:27:21.530 --> 01:27:23.031]  Dial R for Radiation.
[01:27:23.591 --> 01:27:27.893]  Alex Jones discovers the wondrous new vitamin R for radiation.
[01:27:27.933 --> 01:27:30.614]  That's up at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[01:27:30.634 --> 01:27:31.755]  It's a little short video, but
[01:27:32.921 --> 01:27:35.862]  That's the spirit of it, because everything's been given to them.
[01:27:36.002 --> 01:27:44.864]  They're living on the carcass of the richest, greatest country ever, that hardcore, vicious, smart, aggressive, the most inventive, the most trailblazing.
[01:27:45.424 --> 01:27:47.424]  Everybody came here through incredible hardship.
[01:27:47.484 --> 01:27:51.285]  I don't care what color you were, whether you were Chinese, black, white, you name it.
[01:27:51.585 --> 01:27:52.726]  Super hard continent.
[01:27:53.106 --> 01:27:54.266]  Wars, you name it.
[01:27:55.188 --> 01:28:08.291]  Building a continent and a civilization out of nothing, the pinnacle of power, strength, ruggedness, piracy, criminality, Christ-likeness, everything, it was here.
[01:28:09.191 --> 01:28:10.752]  The good, the bad, and the ugly, this was it.
[01:28:13.752 --> 01:28:24.095]  And now there's these soft nothings who just think it's funny to laugh at death and destruction and Dennis Rodman hanging out with a mass-murdering scumbag.
[01:28:24.980 --> 01:28:33.168]  Who isn't even a mass-murdering scumbag like his grandfather, who actually took power, was in a big war, killed a bunch of people, and set up a cult for himself.
[01:28:34.569 --> 01:28:36.911]  That guy I don't like, but I can respect him.
[01:28:37.552 --> 01:28:41.555]  Then there's his pathetic son, and all the horrible things he did, and then this guy.
[01:28:41.575 --> 01:28:49.743]  You know, that's the cherry on top, is that it's a soft, weak, pudgy-hand person who's never been in a fistfight,
[01:28:51.138 --> 01:28:57.983]  Never had to get a paycheck, never gone hungry, and now gets to strut around with people worshipping him like God.
[01:28:58.263 --> 01:29:10.973]  They say the sun comes up because of him, and the birds sing, they actually say that, and that magic lights are seen around him by a horrible tyranny that has the people literally worshipping him.
[01:29:11.694 --> 01:29:16.918]  And then I have to see people making jokes about him, and now I've gone off into the Netherlands ranting about this.
[01:29:17.298 --> 01:29:18.399]  It fundamentally
[01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:24.208]  Freaks me out, and is the greatest poster child for everything I've ever talked about.
[01:29:24.769 --> 01:29:31.200]  With this cult of the state, and the people that want to become something through the state, and as the state gets bigger, they will ascend.
[01:29:31.501 --> 01:29:32.943]  No, you will wreck everything!
[01:29:33.717 --> 01:29:36.439]  And people would say the state created civilization.
[01:29:36.499 --> 01:29:44.406]  No, the state is the managers of civilization that end up being the farmers on us, the slaves on the plantation.
[01:29:44.606 --> 01:29:48.369]  And I want a worldwide revolt of humanity against the technocrats.
[01:29:48.549 --> 01:29:50.331]  I want true libertà.
[01:29:50.911 --> 01:29:51.812]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.312 --> 01:29:53.913]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.834 --> 01:29:57.516]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:33:08.639 --> 01:33:14.942]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:23.427 --> 01:33:24.387]  Hard to turn that off.
[01:33:28.750 --> 01:33:34.393]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen, trying to ignite the human spirit that refuses to submit to tyranny.
[01:33:35.560 --> 01:33:37.922]  Lighting the brush fires of freedom worldwide.
[01:33:38.002 --> 01:33:39.203]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[01:33:39.523 --> 01:33:42.285]  I want to go to some of your phone calls and I've got to get into this cancer news.
[01:33:43.226 --> 01:33:44.767]  What the globalists are striving for.
[01:33:44.847 --> 01:33:47.849]  Some pretty amazing information that I haven't covered probably in a decade.
[01:33:49.250 --> 01:33:55.214]  There's so many times that I'll mention something and I'll remember I haven't talked about it in ages because years go by so quickly.
[01:33:55.254 --> 01:33:56.115]  At least they do for me.
[01:33:56.495 --> 01:33:58.577]  But everybody I talk to says things are accelerating.
[01:34:00.318 --> 01:34:03.240]  But North Korea has cut its hotline for the first time in 50 years.
[01:34:04.747 --> 01:34:05.988]  Or more, since 53.
[01:34:07.389 --> 01:34:09.270]  Almost 60 years, or is 60 years.
[01:34:10.371 --> 01:34:12.473]  And is threatening nuclear attack on the U.S.
[01:34:12.553 --> 01:34:13.173]  or its neighbors.
[01:34:13.213 --> 01:34:14.755]  And they can hit Japan very easily.
[01:34:15.255 --> 01:34:16.476]  They can also hit California.
[01:34:17.036 --> 01:34:19.839]  It's a question of, would the missile actually go into orbit and come back down?
[01:34:19.859 --> 01:34:26.343]  You know, they're going to have to keep DC-10s in the area circling to shoot that sucker down.
[01:34:26.404 --> 01:34:27.945]  They use, again, particle beams to do it.
[01:34:28.885 --> 01:34:29.986]  Directed energy weapons.
[01:34:32.828 --> 01:34:33.469]  Man, I tell you.
[01:34:37.622 --> 01:34:39.363]  Just insane times to be alive.
[01:34:39.603 --> 01:34:40.744]  Just totally insane.
[01:34:41.585 --> 01:34:42.806]  And again, who's threatening this?
[01:34:43.126 --> 01:34:46.708]  One scumbag tyrant against another group of tyrants that have taken over our country.
[01:34:47.889 --> 01:34:50.131]  If you are worried about your safety, get a dog.
[01:34:52.232 --> 01:34:53.473]  Can we play that one more time?
[01:34:53.493 --> 01:34:55.674]  That took my breath away.
[01:34:56.835 --> 01:35:00.338]  That's the one, the only Jabba the Hutt on our show premiering here.
[01:35:00.758 --> 01:35:02.940]  If you are worried about your safety, get a dog.
[01:35:05.191 --> 01:35:07.813]  Yeah, and I asked the guys for that clip earlier if you just joined us.
[01:35:08.353 --> 01:35:11.195]  Infowars.com, PrisonBlooded.com, top story.
[01:35:11.496 --> 01:35:13.437]  The police will protect you, so turn in your gun.
[01:35:14.458 --> 01:35:26.446]  And he's got all these links to articles and videos of the police and other people saying that you don't need a gun, get a
[01:35:28.385 --> 01:35:30.987]  Dog, and that the police will protect you.
[01:35:31.668 --> 01:35:42.196]  You guys give that clip to Kurt, or show him where it is online, and also get him to add the Veritas video that we were playing on the Nightly News last week, where the cops in station after station are like, get a dog!
[01:35:42.677 --> 01:35:43.737]  No, you don't need a gun.
[01:35:45.339 --> 01:35:46.640]  Yes, I will come and take your guns.
[01:35:48.194 --> 01:35:51.036]  And it was all eastern cities fully controlled by the globalists.
[01:35:51.056 --> 01:36:04.305]  They're full of great people, but I mean, man, they're really hiring the next wave of police, because most cops are pro-gun, because they're around guns, they know guns make crime go down, they know criminals are going to have guns anyways, and they tend to be more libertarian or constitutionalist.
[01:36:04.646 --> 01:36:05.626]  You can call them conservative.
[01:36:05.987 --> 01:36:06.827]  Paleo-conservative.
[01:36:07.408 --> 01:36:11.450]  But not in Chicago, not in New York, and that's an oversimplification, obviously.
[01:36:12.371 --> 01:36:13.932]  Not in places they control.
[01:36:14.072 --> 01:36:14.973]  I mean, it's scary.
[01:36:16.260 --> 01:36:19.101]  To know they will come for our guns and they are the future.
[01:36:19.541 --> 01:36:27.063]  Under federalization of police, they are just taking departments over everywhere and putting a bunch of nanny state weirdos in.
[01:36:28.623 --> 01:36:32.544]  Who have that same control freak look in their eye that I see in the North Korean leadership's eye.
[01:36:32.904 --> 01:36:34.764]  You all know the look of a crazed nut.
[01:36:35.685 --> 01:36:38.705]  Of a control freak nobody who wouldn't have been anything in their life.
[01:36:39.546 --> 01:36:44.987]  And who's so insecure about their powerlessness that they overcompensate by acting like total jerks.
[01:36:46.673 --> 01:36:49.154]  And I, I just, it just punches my buttons around those people.
[01:36:49.234 --> 01:36:51.615]  I just, I just turned like a wild gorilla or something, man.
[01:36:51.655 --> 01:36:55.156]  I'm like, don't you try to dominate me.
[01:36:56.456 --> 01:36:57.517]  And see, that's the problem.
[01:36:57.557 --> 01:37:04.239]  Those of us that are strong, those of us that are dominant, we don't like to act dominant because we're naturally dominant.
[01:37:04.559 --> 01:37:07.820]  Dominant just wants to protect people, be strong, build things.
[01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:08.880]  We like cool people.
[01:37:09.121 --> 01:37:10.321]  We like successful people.
[01:37:10.361 --> 01:37:11.261]  We like success.
[01:37:11.621 --> 01:37:15.243]  And then there's always scum trying to gang up on us and feed off of us.
[01:37:15.263 --> 01:37:16.143]  And I've had enough of it.
[01:37:18.871 --> 01:37:23.433]  So North Korean leadership and Obama's people and all of you, just go back to hell where you came from.
[01:37:24.353 --> 01:37:33.117]  I see what you are, a bunch of ugly chicken neck scum, pathetic trash, who want to walk around on red carpets and land in big jet airplanes and have us all live in awe of you.
[01:37:33.557 --> 01:37:40.680]  The way to bring down the new old order is just to hate these people and to spit when you see them and to laugh at them and to know they're a bunch of North Korean trash.
[01:37:41.540 --> 01:37:41.840]  They are.
[01:37:41.880 --> 01:37:43.541]  They're a bunch of North Korean wannabes.
[01:37:43.561 --> 01:37:45.782]  Alright, I said I'd take your calls.
[01:37:45.842 --> 01:37:47.102]  I said I'd get into the cancer news.
[01:37:47.122 --> 01:37:48.503]  I got Max Keiser coming up.
[01:37:50.185 --> 01:37:51.626]  I've got all this other news as well.
[01:37:51.826 --> 01:37:53.868]  Man, the economy news we're going to cover in the next hour.
[01:37:53.888 --> 01:37:56.410]  We've got David Knight's piece.
[01:37:56.450 --> 01:37:57.091]  How long is that?
[01:37:57.131 --> 01:37:57.892]  I know it's excellent.
[01:37:57.912 --> 01:38:01.475]  All right, get it ready.
[01:38:01.915 --> 01:38:03.356]  I'm going to take calls quickly.
[01:38:03.396 --> 01:38:04.137]  Just have your point ready.
[01:38:04.157 --> 01:38:04.838]  I'll go to the next person.
[01:38:04.878 --> 01:38:05.798]  I appreciate you calling in.
[01:38:06.219 --> 01:38:08.220]  Jody in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[01:38:08.260 --> 01:38:08.601]  Welcome.
[01:38:09.161 --> 01:38:09.642]  Thank you.
[01:38:09.662 --> 01:38:15.787]  I'm having a call in on this North Korean wonderful piece of work.
[01:38:16.027 --> 01:38:16.848]  Isn't he handsome?
[01:38:17.805 --> 01:38:20.948]  Oh yes, I think I'm along with you there.
[01:38:21.468 --> 01:38:31.377]  I think we ought to take him and Dennis Rodman and put them in a room with no windows, lock the door, and both of us go in there with baseball bats and lay about freely.
[01:38:32.397 --> 01:38:40.524]  Well, we don't want to call for any violence against Dennis Rodman, a burnout, you know, reported drug addict, just pathetic ringwraith.
[01:38:40.564 --> 01:38:43.487]  But I mean, Kim Jong-un is a demon.
[01:38:47.850 --> 01:39:02.593]  Whatever demonic angel Satan has over North Korea, it's probably Satan himself, whatever principality the Bible says has a certain demon over each city, because the devil has his top angels, whatever one is there, infest the leader.
[01:39:02.613 --> 01:39:05.014]  Because I'm telling you, his son is now possessed.
[01:39:05.054 --> 01:39:10.015]  He has the same demonic look, jack-o-lantern look, that the other leaders have.
[01:39:10.055 --> 01:39:10.915]  I'm serious, look at it.
[01:39:11.415 --> 01:39:12.256]  He is possessed.
[01:39:14.988 --> 01:39:25.055]  I saw the report last week when they first announced that North Korea was planning a preemptive against the United States.
[01:39:25.975 --> 01:39:34.541]  And I just got to thinking about it because I just watched Strategic Relocation and Joel Skousen had said something about a nuclear attack.
[01:39:35.061 --> 01:39:38.964]  Now with this coming out in public news,
[01:39:39.605 --> 01:39:45.861]  Do you think it might be possible that we could be seeing that as a false flag and get hit?
[01:39:48.509 --> 01:39:57.355]  Absolutely, North Korea is the only, they call it the Herman Empire, and I've done deep analysis, North Korea is its own Looney Tune land.
[01:39:58.276 --> 01:40:06.741]  And it's not just Intel and years of study, it's I can look at those people, they are just in another world driving around in 57 Chevys, and they can't even tie their shoelaces.
[01:40:07.302 --> 01:40:13.806]  I mean they sell, this was even in Vanity Fair, confirmed, the only meat for sale for the small middle class is dead babies.
[01:40:15.514 --> 01:40:16.154]  And dead people.
[01:40:16.674 --> 01:40:18.895]  And that's what they serve as human flesh.
[01:40:19.595 --> 01:40:21.516]  I mean, it's just total cuckoo land.
[01:40:22.056 --> 01:40:24.136]  I mean, look at those generals I'm showing on TV right now.
[01:40:24.216 --> 01:40:28.397]  I mean, that is just... And I understand why the yuppies think it's funny, but it isn't funny.
[01:40:29.317 --> 01:40:32.698]  There's millions of people held captive by them that are being fed on by them right now.
[01:40:33.158 --> 01:40:37.799]  That's why I started talking about making sick jokes about it, because it makes me sick too.
[01:40:37.819 --> 01:40:38.720]  It makes me sick.
[01:40:39.140 --> 01:40:40.080]  Just get it off the screen.
[01:40:40.120 --> 01:40:40.500]  Get it off.
[01:40:40.580 --> 01:40:40.960]  Get it off.
[01:40:41.500 --> 01:40:42.680]  Seriously, I can't handle it anymore.
[01:40:43.041 --> 01:40:43.701]  God bless you, ma'am.
[01:40:43.741 --> 01:40:44.541]  I appreciate your call.
[01:40:46.141 --> 01:40:48.982]  I mean, just look at all those little soft toadies.
[01:40:50.143 --> 01:40:51.963]  I've seen it a million times in government.
[01:40:52.724 --> 01:40:59.206]  And notice all the police chiefs that are up there saying ban guns, and the Congress people, they all have that weird softness to them.
[01:40:59.747 --> 01:41:09.571]  All the police chiefs and sheriffs that are out there pro-gun and anti-terror, they all look really tough and mean and they've got light in their eyes because they have an instinct to want to actually help people.
[01:41:10.331 --> 01:41:12.973]  Evil always looks like little soft people.
[01:41:13.093 --> 01:41:15.894]  I'm so sick of them!
[01:41:16.255 --> 01:41:17.635]  I'm sick of them ruling over us!
[01:41:17.675 --> 01:41:19.056]  I'm tired of it!
[01:41:19.176 --> 01:41:20.257]  It's backwards!
[01:41:22.078 --> 01:41:27.001]  Going back thousands of years ago, scum started getting together to dominate the strong and make us their slaves.
[01:41:27.621 --> 01:41:29.162]  That's how this works, and I'm sick of it.
[01:41:29.422 --> 01:41:32.004]  And if you stop bending over, it won't ever get to this point.
[01:41:33.220 --> 01:41:34.361]  Let's go to another call here.
[01:41:34.401 --> 01:41:36.603]  Let's talk to Scott in California.
[01:41:37.823 --> 01:41:39.365]  Says, is a ammo manufacturer.
[01:41:39.385 --> 01:41:40.385]  Yeah, I have an article about that.
[01:41:40.806 --> 01:41:45.129]  Almost every ammo manufacturer, they're estimating over 90%, are now officially sold out.
[01:41:45.489 --> 01:41:56.417]  I talked to a major distributor, one of the biggest in the country, he's looking around for ammo two weeks ago, and he said by April, they're gonna be sold out nationwide and guns.
[01:41:56.457 --> 01:41:59.159]  And I talked to another gun dealer, was told the same thing.
[01:41:59.199 --> 01:41:59.760]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:42:01.380 --> 01:42:03.041]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:42:03.221 --> 01:42:03.521]  You bet.
[01:42:04.981 --> 01:42:08.482]  I have waited all last week because I wanted to bring this to you personally.
[01:42:09.502 --> 01:42:15.784]  And we're a small ammunition manufacturer, and we would like to make a pledge to the American people.
[01:42:16.665 --> 01:42:21.206]  And that pledge is that we will sell our ammo to civilians first.
[01:42:21.346 --> 01:42:24.507]  And I'm seeing this all over the place, is that one of the big reasons
[01:42:25.316 --> 01:42:26.497]  Yeah, let me tell you what's happening.
[01:42:26.517 --> 01:42:28.679]  I mean, I agree, this is a total victory here.
[01:42:28.759 --> 01:42:30.741]  This is the blueprint for total victory.
[01:42:42.512 --> 01:42:45.314]  All over the country, it was like five, then it was ten.
[01:42:46.175 --> 01:42:58.204]  I saw an article last night where it's over 50 major manufacturers, and that's most of them, are now saying they're not going to sell to the feds or any other municipality that's for victim disarmament for the citizens.
[01:42:58.464 --> 01:43:01.347]  And they're looking to see if that municipality's pro-gun.
[01:43:01.367 --> 01:43:01.907]  And I agree.
[01:43:02.408 --> 01:43:03.889]  They should only sell to citizens.
[01:43:04.489 --> 01:43:11.350]  And municipalities that are pro-gun and show our real muscle before they shut us down with a industry boycott.
[01:43:11.370 --> 01:43:14.651]  See, they're trying to bankrupt the gun industry with lawsuits and stuff.
[01:43:14.931 --> 01:43:17.572]  It's time for the gun industry to bankrupt them.
[01:43:18.372 --> 01:43:19.832]  You've got to fight fire with fire.
[01:43:19.872 --> 01:43:20.372]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:43:21.833 --> 01:43:25.453]  Yeah, so I want to throw down the gauntlet to all the other manufacturers.
[01:43:25.513 --> 01:43:32.775]  Now, I understand there's the policeloophole.com website with firearm manufacturers who are saying they won't sell
[01:43:33.991 --> 01:43:39.614]  Guns to municipalities or the like that they aren't allowed to sell to the people.
[01:43:39.814 --> 01:43:41.095]  And that's a good start.
[01:43:41.515 --> 01:43:43.376]  But what good are guns without ammunition?
[01:43:43.816 --> 01:43:51.080]  And what we have to have is all the ammunition manufacturers step up and say, we are going to fill civilian orders first, not last.
[01:43:51.140 --> 01:43:56.043]  And let me tell the listeners, you can confirm this and tell us about your company if you want, because I want to check it out.
[01:43:56.883 --> 01:43:58.504]  I believe you, but I want to verify it as well.
[01:43:58.865 --> 01:43:59.965]  And I'm also a capitalist.
[01:44:00.265 --> 01:44:01.186]  Maybe become a sponsor.
[01:44:01.206 --> 01:44:02.647]  Not that you need any sponsorship, I'm sure.
[01:44:03.567 --> 01:44:08.852]  They have, under EPA regulations, passed 20 years ago, but implemented last year.
[01:44:08.872 --> 01:44:09.952]  They always grandfather it.
[01:44:10.213 --> 01:44:14.957]  They're shutting down all the lead mines in the U.S., so they're having to go get it out of aircraft and stuff.
[01:44:15.257 --> 01:44:24.404]  The only place that has big lead mines we're allowed to get it from is China, and they're talking about an embargo now, because they've called for us to have our guns taken where we can't get the lead.
[01:44:24.504 --> 01:44:24.825]  Go ahead.
[01:44:26.081 --> 01:44:26.341]  Right.
[01:44:26.962 --> 01:44:27.842]  I believe it.
[01:44:28.483 --> 01:44:35.227]  The primary source for our bullets is we're using copper bullets, so hopefully that won't impact us too much.
[01:44:36.027 --> 01:44:37.688]  Am I allowed to mention my company's name?
[01:44:37.728 --> 01:44:38.389]  Yeah, yeah, mention it.
[01:44:38.669 --> 01:44:39.410]  I want some ammo, though.
[01:44:39.450 --> 01:44:39.830]  Alright.
[01:44:40.710 --> 01:44:42.491]  We're Monolithic Munitions.
[01:44:43.552 --> 01:44:49.396]  Our website is monolithicmunitions.com, and we're a very small manufacturer.
[01:44:49.436 --> 01:44:50.637]  How much do you produce a month?
[01:44:52.250 --> 01:44:54.891]  We're about 5,000 to 10,000 rounds a month at this point.
[01:44:55.131 --> 01:44:55.752]  I love it though.
[01:44:56.012 --> 01:44:56.712]  We need all sorts.
[01:44:56.752 --> 01:45:04.576]  You see, listen, them shutting it down and buying 2 billion rounds to dry it up and doing all this is only making all these small manufacturers open up.
[01:45:05.176 --> 01:45:08.618]  And then there's all these small gun manufacturers opening up.
[01:45:08.938 --> 01:45:09.578]  I just love it.
[01:45:09.598 --> 01:45:10.739]  I just love supply and demand.
[01:45:10.759 --> 01:45:12.299]  We're going to stomp their butt in the ground.
[01:45:12.639 --> 01:45:13.780]  Listen, I've got to jump, brother.
[01:45:13.820 --> 01:45:16.241]  Send an email to ShowTipsAtInfoWars.com.
[01:45:16.601 --> 01:45:17.522]  We'd like to talk to you more.
[01:45:17.562 --> 01:45:18.042]  God bless.
[01:45:18.622 --> 01:45:20.003]  Okay, I'm going to stop right there.
[01:45:21.274 --> 01:45:23.863]  This basically, this next report tells it all.
[01:45:23.883 --> 01:45:25.007]  I'm going to come back with your calls.
[01:45:26.397 --> 01:45:27.778]  This next report tells it all.
[01:45:27.878 --> 01:45:33.461]  CBS News went out and did a report, but they said Pamplin ordinance not enforced during South by Southwest.
[01:45:33.862 --> 01:45:36.523]  The city's claiming you can't hand out literature anywhere in the city.
[01:45:36.743 --> 01:45:37.684]  That's total fraud.
[01:45:37.944 --> 01:45:42.087]  When the police were put on the spot, they refused to enforce it after we made a big stink out of it.
[01:45:42.927 --> 01:45:46.249]  And this just shows the incredible tyranny that's going on.
[01:45:46.269 --> 01:45:48.731]  And then they said we couldn't have bumper stickers on our car.
[01:45:48.991 --> 01:45:51.732]  So that shows how far they want to take all this.
[01:45:52.053 --> 01:45:54.094]  Here is David Knight's report.
[01:45:54.374 --> 01:45:55.815]  What is your line in the sand?
[01:45:56.877 --> 01:45:58.858]  March 6th, 1836.
[01:45:58.958 --> 01:46:02.920]  The Battle for the Alamo.
[01:46:02.940 --> 01:46:04.140]  177 years ago.
[01:46:04.940 --> 01:46:06.941]  We still remember and celebrate their bravery.
[01:46:07.882 --> 01:46:08.942]  But what did they die for?
[01:46:09.462 --> 01:46:11.023]  It wasn't Anglo versus Mexican.
[01:46:11.703 --> 01:46:15.485]  It was people of every tongue, tribe, and race standing against tyranny.
[01:46:16.745 --> 01:46:17.866]  They could have gone along quietly.
[01:46:18.834 --> 01:46:22.817]  They could have surrendered, and surrendered their freedoms, but they didn't.
[01:46:23.978 --> 01:46:28.182]  They drew their line in the sand and said, we'll die before we give up our freedoms.
[01:46:28.762 --> 01:46:36.909]  Well, Colonel Travis drew a line in the sand at the Alamo, and 60 years before the Alamo, the founders of this country drew the line at a small tax on tea.
[01:46:38.290 --> 01:46:40.192]  Where do you draw the line on tyranny?
[01:46:42.096 --> 01:46:49.958]  As I returned to Austin, I found that like cities all over America, corporatists were trying to deny basic freedoms by intimidation.
[01:46:51.099 --> 01:46:53.879]  South by Southwest is big business here in Austin.
[01:46:54.579 --> 01:47:00.541]  It's a huge industry show for music, film, and interactive media, and they seem to think they own Austin for that week.
[01:47:01.681 --> 01:47:10.324]  As InfoWars was handing out our monthly magazine for free, South by Southwest got some Austin police officers to issue warnings, then tickets, and we wouldn't stop.
[01:47:11.343 --> 01:47:16.944]  But there is no ordinance against handing out free information on public streets, whether or not South by Southwest is in town.
[01:47:17.484 --> 01:47:22.205]  I had my car parked there with some banners on the side, and that was illegal.
[01:47:22.645 --> 01:47:27.846]  So they told me they were going to give me a ticket that I was going to get in trouble just because I had my banners there.
[01:47:27.866 --> 01:47:29.906]  I had some magazines in front of the car.
[01:47:30.526 --> 01:47:33.087]  So it is true, we had to hassle with that.
[01:47:33.107 --> 01:47:34.907]  They told you they couldn't hand them out.
[01:47:35.087 --> 01:47:35.867]  We gotta take it.
[01:47:35.887 --> 01:47:40.948]  Yeah, and then this cop, he was giving out warnings to everybody, even people that were giving away free logs.
[01:47:41.568 --> 01:47:45.850]  Yeah, they got tickets as well.
[01:47:45.950 --> 01:47:54.614]  Actually, this guy was harassing us and saying that we can't give away more magazines because we are not sponsors of South by Southwest.
[01:47:54.654 --> 01:47:55.314]  Did you hear that?
[01:47:55.354 --> 01:48:02.018]  Now South by Southwest people are saying that the cops are harassing us because the cops are now behaving like they should under the Constitution.
[01:48:02.498 --> 01:48:05.139]  They're now having people come up
[01:48:05.199 --> 01:48:11.283]  The harassers say you can't on city streets hand a magazine out because you're not shopped by Southwest.
[01:48:11.564 --> 01:48:14.346]  They now say they own Austin.
[01:48:15.266 --> 01:48:17.428]  Does the Chronicle own Austin?
[01:48:17.468 --> 01:48:21.711]  Because nothing stops people that aren't backing down!
[01:48:22.171 --> 01:48:24.873]  Nothing stops people that are willing to die!
[01:48:24.893 --> 01:48:27.315]  Nothing stops 1776!
[01:48:27.375 --> 01:48:28.916]  Nothing stops it!
[01:48:29.117 --> 01:48:30.898]  You got that, scum?
[01:48:38.917 --> 01:48:40.517]  The words for V for Vendetta.
[01:48:41.198 --> 01:48:42.818]  Flesh and blood, it dies.
[01:48:43.978 --> 01:48:46.459]  It's not bulletproof, but ideas.
[01:48:47.299 --> 01:48:50.180]  Ideas are bulletproof!
[01:48:50.220 --> 01:48:51.000]  You got that?
[01:48:51.060 --> 01:48:53.000]  I am bulletproof forever!
[01:48:53.280 --> 01:48:59.322]  We're all bulletproof when we stand in the light and stand for liberty.
[01:48:59.862 --> 01:49:03.083]  And only you tyrants can go straight to hell.
[01:49:07.585 --> 01:49:23.652]  To stand against these pirates, to stand against these straw men, to stand against these thugs, to stand against these control freaks that thought they'd come here with their trendy Hollywood mafia crap and tell us they run our waters!
[01:49:23.732 --> 01:49:25.553]  They don't run anything!
[01:49:25.613 --> 01:49:27.754]  Liberty or death!
[01:49:27.774 --> 01:49:29.615]  Liberty or death!
[01:49:29.875 --> 01:49:31.596]  Liberty or death!
[01:49:31.616 --> 01:49:33.476]  Liberty or death!
[01:49:33.856 --> 01:49:35.117]  Liberty or death!
[01:49:35.157 --> 01:49:36.217]  Liberty or death!
[01:49:36.277 --> 01:49:40.078]  Take all the listeners that came down here in a flash protest.
[01:49:40.098 --> 01:49:42.239]  You folks are awesome.
[01:49:42.299 --> 01:49:46.200]  And I know I keep saying that, but it is so humbling to sit here and talk to you.
[01:49:46.240 --> 01:49:47.260]  I want to say this.
[01:49:47.781 --> 01:49:48.441]  I salute you!
[01:49:48.521 --> 01:49:53.863]  Those that actually aren't in a trance and that are awake and understand what's happening.
[01:49:54.663 --> 01:49:58.064]  You are the founders of the new republic.
[01:49:58.744 --> 01:50:11.467]  The globalists have already taken over the old republic, and we will restore the great republic again, and as the pirates try to oppress the people, that will only make more of us awaken!
[01:50:14.148 --> 01:50:15.428]  The answer to 1984 is 1776!
[01:50:30.353 --> 01:50:32.553]  Alright, great job Ja'Kari Jackson and David Knight.
[01:50:32.793 --> 01:50:37.615]  David Knight put that together at his house on his own computer working over the weekend to get the information out.
[01:50:38.035 --> 01:50:39.576]  We're going to come back with more calls.
[01:50:40.731 --> 01:50:42.732]  And then I guess I'll have to go into overdrive or something.
[01:50:42.752 --> 01:50:43.053]  You know what?
[01:50:43.113 --> 01:50:45.294]  I promise to get to the cancer news.
[01:50:45.795 --> 01:50:47.836]  Let me cover a big secret next.
[01:50:47.876 --> 01:50:48.937]  Then I'll take some calls.
[01:50:49.297 --> 01:50:50.918]  Then we'll get Max Keiser's coming on.
[01:50:51.299 --> 01:50:53.280]  But Zachary and others, your calls are coming up.
[01:50:53.640 --> 01:50:54.761]  Again, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:50:54.861 --> 01:50:58.984]  You're listening to the InfoWars Worldwide Radio Transmission for Liberty.
[01:50:59.264 --> 01:50:59.945]  Please stand by.
[01:51:02.321 --> 01:51:05.826]  If you're listening, you know your basic freedoms are being threatened every day.
[01:51:06.106 --> 01:51:09.190]  If you're listening, you know the economy is not getting better.
[01:51:09.370 --> 01:51:11.794]  You know gas and food prices are skyrocketing.
[01:51:12.174 --> 01:51:14.097]  Now is the time to get prepared.
[01:51:14.317 --> 01:51:17.161]  For years we've told you about our friends at eFoods Direct.

[01:52:02.122 --> 01:52:03.703]  Hey everybody, Ty Bollinger here.
[01:52:03.883 --> 01:52:06.164]  Once again, real life, real stories.
[01:52:06.564 --> 01:52:07.945]  And he discovered Carnivora.
[01:52:08.465 --> 01:52:13.167]  Was so thrilled with the product that he shared it with his family and his friends and his patients.
[01:52:13.447 --> 01:52:15.868]  My dad was a family physician, he was a medical doctor.
[01:52:15.888 --> 01:52:18.729]  Almost all the symptoms were either diminished or gone.
[01:52:18.769 --> 01:52:20.830]  Amazing product, amazing result.
[01:52:21.050 --> 01:52:28.255]  It's like an amazing thing having such a profound change in how I feel and knowing that it was the carnivora that did it.
[01:52:28.575 --> 01:52:34.619]  And a lot of patients got better, ranging from immune dysfunction to allergies and infection.
[01:52:34.880 --> 01:52:41.885]  Here's the toll-free telephone number to call to access the Carnivora Telecast at carnivora.com on Tuesday, March 12th, 8 p.m.
[01:52:41.925 --> 01:52:42.365]  Eastern Time.
[01:52:42.685 --> 01:52:42.865]  Call 1-888-694-9666.
[01:52:42.885 --> 01:52:43.226]  That's 1-888-694-9666.
[01:52:43.286 --> 01:52:43.706]  Once again, 1-888-694-9666.
[01:52:43.726 --> 01:52:45.348]  Visit carnivora.com or call 1-866-VENUSFLY to order now.
[01:53:01.391 --> 01:53:06.393]  We travel so much and having a fake TV, well, it gives added peace of mind.
[01:53:06.553 --> 01:53:16.077]  Burglars look for houses that appear to be easy targets, but fake TV can fool even professional burglars into thinking someone is home watching television.
[01:53:16.438 --> 01:53:28.383]  As a recent widow living alone, it gives me great peace of mind to set my fake TV near a window and know that passing motorists and pedestrians will think someone is home watching TV when I'm actually away from home.
[01:53:28.840 --> 01:53:33.245]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet just like a light on a timer.
[01:53:33.525 --> 01:53:35.067]  And they're so easy to use.
[01:53:35.307 --> 01:53:37.189]  You just plug them in and they're ready to go.
[01:53:37.209 --> 01:53:40.953]  Plus, they're so affordable that we have one upstairs and downstairs.
[01:53:41.414 --> 01:53:42.635]  Fake TV is only $34.95.
[01:53:44.537 --> 01:53:48.062]  Order your fake TV by calling 877-5-FAKE-TV or go to FAKETV.com.
[01:53:48.142 --> 01:53:49.323]  That's 877-532-5388 or FAKETV.com.
[01:53:49.404 --> 01:53:51.666]  FAKETV, the burglar deterrent.
[01:54:26.986 --> 01:54:36.558]  Alright, if you're tuning in via radio, you can just type in to a search engine, immortalized cell line, to find out about this.
[01:54:37.299 --> 01:54:39.942]  And the reason this is so important is the globalist
[01:54:40.828 --> 01:54:54.993]  Since the 50s have been writing about this, but intensely the last 20 years, in their different eugenics publications, one line of immortality they believe they're going to achieve, whether that's real or not, that's what they're building this whole world government for.
[01:54:55.454 --> 01:54:59.355]  Build a world government to dumb us down, soft kill us, exterminate us.
[01:54:59.815 --> 01:55:05.898]  They publicly say 80 to 90 percent, but their more internal documents that we've published, when we dig them up, are 99 percent.
[01:55:06.798 --> 01:55:10.980]  You don't tell the general crew, hey, we're going to kill everybody because they can do the math.
[01:55:11.541 --> 01:55:12.581]  Well, then you're going to kill me.
[01:55:12.621 --> 01:55:13.902]  No, they said we're going to kill 80%.
[01:55:14.462 --> 01:55:16.963]  But then in the higher level meetings, it's we're going to kill everybody.
[01:55:17.484 --> 01:55:24.307]  And then the 1% that's allowed to live in the new magical kingdom they're going to build will merge with computers.
[01:55:24.648 --> 01:55:26.669]  And that's the dominant line.
[01:55:27.449 --> 01:55:35.896]  That Kurzweil and others run, and this is the religion that, you know, the TED cult, and that's a mid-level deal that people pay $8,000 to be part of.
[01:55:36.516 --> 01:55:39.359]  They're just the useful idiots actually funding the higher-level cult.
[01:55:39.999 --> 01:55:41.140]  That's what they're setting up.
[01:55:41.280 --> 01:55:42.481]  That's what the UN's about.
[01:55:43.062 --> 01:55:43.682]  All this stuff.
[01:55:44.903 --> 01:55:45.564]  And it's a race.
[01:55:45.604 --> 01:55:51.609]  So they've got the development line for the cybernetic interfaces for extended life.
[01:55:54.505 --> 01:55:59.106]  And then they've got the immortalized cell line area.
[01:55:59.126 --> 01:56:02.347]  And I want to show TV viewers, radio listeners, just search this.
[01:56:02.807 --> 01:56:03.867]  Henrietta Lacks.
[01:56:05.368 --> 01:56:09.009]  And she was born in 1920, died in 1951.
[01:56:10.089 --> 01:56:14.270]  And she died of a very fast-acting cancer that just killed her in about a month.
[01:56:15.786 --> 01:56:22.149]  And if you read the science legacy, they found that most cells will start dividing.
[01:56:23.049 --> 01:56:28.471]  They'll become cancerous when they try to repair their DNA and start mutating.
[01:56:28.951 --> 01:56:33.053]  Normal cells will start dividing slower and then you die because your cells don't replenish themselves.
[01:56:34.093 --> 01:56:38.915]  But generally before that happens, others learn how to fix themselves and start mutating and take over.
[01:56:40.916 --> 01:56:42.117]  And I'm oversimplifying this.
[01:56:42.137 --> 01:56:42.857]  This is so important.
[01:56:42.878 --> 01:56:44.299]  I'm going to do a whole report on it this week.
[01:56:44.379 --> 01:56:45.920]  I will do it this week with Aaron Dykes.
[01:56:47.021 --> 01:56:50.643]  But just to give you a forte of what's coming up, then we'll air the special report here, let's say by Friday.
[01:56:50.663 --> 01:56:51.844]  I'll probably shoot it today or tomorrow.
[01:56:52.044 --> 01:56:53.305]  Then he'll put it together for Friday.
[01:56:54.987 --> 01:57:02.092]  And it said the cells from her tumor were given to researcher George Galloway, who discovered that Henrietta's cells had something he'd never seen before.
[01:57:02.673 --> 01:57:04.094]  They could be kept alive and grown.
[01:57:05.798 --> 01:57:06.979]  And did not die.
[01:57:07.100 --> 01:57:09.282]  Generally they die within a few days, just cultured.
[01:57:09.902 --> 01:57:17.370]  But even with medium, or without the medium, these cells stay alive and continue to replicate and stabilized.
[01:57:18.191 --> 01:57:19.792]  So it is the Lazarus cell.
[01:57:20.353 --> 01:57:22.055]  They use that term in some literature.
[01:57:22.535 --> 01:57:27.180]  It's also been picked up by some of the video game manufacturers, you know, that put out zombie movies and things.
[01:57:28.692 --> 01:57:48.204]  But, when you see a movie, you know, the latest remake of I Am Legend, or The Last Man Alive on Earth, and you see the remake, and they have a cancer vaccine that kills most people, but turns other people down the road, doesn't happen right away, into undead, they can't die, unless you totally, you know, chop them up.
[01:57:49.585 --> 01:57:51.286]  They are one giant cancer.
[01:57:51.947 --> 01:57:53.608]  Their cells have been made immortal.
[01:57:55.578 --> 01:57:59.401]  And when you get into it, this has got the NSA right now going crazy.
[01:57:59.881 --> 01:58:01.522]  This is one of the biggest secrets.
[01:58:02.202 --> 01:58:05.685]  And by secrets, it's in the literature, but they don't want it in the popular culture.
[01:58:05.845 --> 01:58:18.113]  That's why their literature admits it all, but when a show seen as a pop show that actually reaches people on talk radio, TV, that reaches a wide audience, the unwashed audience as they see us, this is not supposed to be talked about.
[01:58:19.221 --> 01:58:26.883]  And so what it does is, you're not literally a zombie, your heart's still beating and everything else, but it turns all your cells into immortal cancer cells.
[01:58:27.704 --> 01:58:33.805]  Now, obviously there's going to be mutations, it's going to kill most people, so they're going to test it on us in the new cancer vaccines that are coming up.
[01:58:34.266 --> 01:58:36.366]  And I've studied the groups involved in that, the UN's involved.
[01:58:36.706 --> 01:58:39.807]  They're going to test their immortality mutation shot on us.
[01:58:42.188 --> 01:58:43.468]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:43.548 --> 01:58:47.230]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.693 --> 01:58:58.677]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, I was still starving.
[01:58:58.917 --> 01:59:16.547]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[01:59:16.807 --> 01:59:20.909]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[01:59:21.189 --> 01:59:22.770]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[01:59:22.950 --> 01:59:30.816]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.

[01:59:37.440 --> 01:59:38.481]  Check it out for yourself.
[01:59:38.721 --> 01:59:39.441]  It's incredible.

[01:59:54.494 --> 01:59:56.417]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.897 --> 01:59:59.681]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:06.243 --> 02:00:10.406]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:11.066 --> 02:00:11.886]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.667 --> 02:00:13.567]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.208 --> 02:00:17.830]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.410 --> 02:00:22.513]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:26.435 --> 02:00:31.758]  We're going to take some phone calls right now, then others will get to talk to Max Keiser.
[02:00:34.355 --> 02:00:36.076]  We've got so much news coming up in this hour.
[02:00:36.136 --> 02:00:37.836]  Right now, let's go to Zachary in Florida.
[02:00:37.856 --> 02:00:38.416]  You're on the air.
[02:00:38.436 --> 02:00:39.157]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:00:39.197 --> 02:00:39.557]  Welcome.
[02:00:40.537 --> 02:00:40.917]  Hi, Alex.
[02:00:40.937 --> 02:00:41.377]  How you doing?
[02:00:41.477 --> 02:00:42.038]  Pretty good, brother.
[02:00:44.018 --> 02:00:51.921]  I've been listening to your show for about two years, and I'm only 14, and I absolutely love your work.
[02:00:52.561 --> 02:00:53.721]  You do an excellent job.
[02:00:54.242 --> 02:00:59.523]  But the main reason why I wanted to call was that I have a YouTube channel, right?
[02:01:01.324 --> 02:01:01.424]  And
[02:01:03.004 --> 02:01:16.566]  Google's been trying to shut my YouTube video down by filing false copyright since I put out a video about how they want to ban most guns.
[02:01:18.195 --> 02:01:20.516]  And they're trying to shut my YouTube channel down?
[02:01:20.616 --> 02:01:23.617]  Yeah, just to be clear, they're not doing it with big people like myself.
[02:01:23.877 --> 02:01:24.938]  Well, actually, they have some.
[02:01:25.278 --> 02:01:31.700]  But we've confirmed thousands of Facebooks are suspended or killed if you promote the Second Amendment, even politely.
[02:01:32.300 --> 02:01:36.102]  Yeah, if you post a Washington Post link with some news about this pro-gun, they shut you down.
[02:01:36.802 --> 02:01:39.103]  And yeah, it's being done selectively to the little guys.
[02:01:39.123 --> 02:01:42.364]  And if they can get away with it with you, they'll get away with everybody.
[02:01:43.244 --> 02:01:43.964]  It's just amazing.
[02:01:44.665 --> 02:01:47.186]  People say, well just leave YouTube, you know, it's their private property.
[02:01:47.246 --> 02:01:47.426]  No.
[02:01:48.106 --> 02:01:55.050]  They operate as a public commons and you're following the rules and they're misappropriating those rules, engaging in false advertising.
[02:01:56.310 --> 02:01:57.131]  And that's what's going on.
[02:01:57.151 --> 02:01:59.112]  We should all invade YouTube.
[02:01:59.672 --> 02:02:02.373]  We're there because that's over half the video views in the world.
[02:02:04.634 --> 02:02:08.176]  It's so ridiculous because I put out a video about
[02:02:08.792 --> 02:02:09.592]  George H.W.
[02:02:09.632 --> 02:02:12.854]  Bush and about his New World Order crap, you know, the speech in 1991.
[02:02:14.174 --> 02:02:19.957]  And they filed a copyright claim by MTV.
[02:02:21.237 --> 02:02:25.619]  MTV filed a copyright claim on an 18-second clip of George H.W.
[02:02:25.659 --> 02:02:25.919]  Bush.
[02:02:26.279 --> 02:02:32.122]  So I told YouTube, I'm tired, I'm really sick and tired of... And was it even from...
[02:02:33.604 --> 02:02:38.526]  Number one, that's a pool camera from C-SPAN, which is paid for at that time by the government.
[02:02:38.566 --> 02:02:39.826]  So yeah, that's a false claim.
[02:02:40.267 --> 02:02:41.527]  Was it even from MTV?
[02:02:42.628 --> 02:02:42.828]  No.
[02:02:43.068 --> 02:02:47.990]  It was a news broadcast from MSNBC.
[02:02:48.090 --> 02:02:51.951]  No, no, and that's not owned by Viacom, last time I checked, which owns MTV.
[02:02:51.991 --> 02:02:55.572]  What you do is, you file a notice under fair use.
[02:02:55.592 --> 02:02:56.573]  That's clearly fair use.
[02:02:58.013 --> 02:02:58.954]  It's so ridiculous.
[02:03:00.366 --> 02:03:02.447]  I just don't understand why they want to shut my YouTube down.
[02:03:02.487 --> 02:03:04.487]  Sir, they want to shut you down because we're hurting them.
[02:03:05.328 --> 02:03:10.149]  They're involved in a criminal takeover, and now people are waking up, so they want to shut down.
[02:03:10.369 --> 02:03:12.109]  What they shut down is viral spread.
[02:03:12.430 --> 02:03:17.691]  If we have some meme on one of our Facebook shows, it's got millions of people total between our ten Facebooks or so.
[02:03:17.751 --> 02:03:21.412]  One's got 300-something thousand, our biggest one, that was a fan site they gave us.
[02:03:21.972 --> 02:03:23.633]  If something's going viral, they kill it.
[02:03:24.933 --> 02:03:26.174]  People say, well, why do you stay on there?
[02:03:26.194 --> 02:03:27.334]  Because that's where the people are.
[02:03:28.902 --> 02:03:32.291]  Like, hey, the city of Austin told you you can't hand out magazines in Austin.
[02:03:32.732 --> 02:03:35.479]  You know, the South by Southwest complained.
[02:03:35.720 --> 02:03:37.825]  Well, I went down there and protested it and they backed off.
[02:03:39.301 --> 02:03:40.522]  And the point is, they'll probably do it again.
[02:03:40.542 --> 02:03:41.543]  We'll have to go back on there again.
[02:03:41.563 --> 02:03:45.186]  I mean, they will overrun us if we keep kissing their butts.
[02:03:45.246 --> 02:03:47.047]  So, I say start more accounts.
[02:03:47.107 --> 02:03:47.928]  Keep uploading it.
[02:03:47.988 --> 02:03:49.089]  Upload it under different names.
[02:03:50.090 --> 02:03:51.851]  Say YouTube banned this video.
[02:03:52.772 --> 02:03:53.733]  Make a big deal out of it.
[02:03:53.773 --> 02:04:00.118]  And everybody realize, while we've still got YouTube and Facebook and the real Alex Jones Twitter, you better be using this stuff.
[02:04:00.498 --> 02:04:02.800]  They want to shut us down because we're effective.
[02:04:03.919 --> 02:04:07.782]  People better realize, folks, now is the time to be fighting like never before.
[02:04:07.822 --> 02:04:09.324]  They do not want you to hear this show.
[02:04:09.644 --> 02:04:20.594]  They do not like the fact that we have street fought up from no stations up to over 150 and huge news websites and are able to do this is unbelievable.
[02:04:20.994 --> 02:04:22.856]  But it's a testament to we're human too.
[02:04:23.116 --> 02:04:24.077]  The globalists are human.
[02:04:24.277 --> 02:04:25.258]  They've been very effective.
[02:04:25.338 --> 02:04:25.999]  We're effective.
[02:04:26.707 --> 02:04:28.408]  You gotta get in the fight, folks.
[02:04:28.428 --> 02:04:30.129]  You gotta get in the fight.
[02:04:30.629 --> 02:04:33.070]  And the first few times, politically, you'll probably get your butt kicked.
[02:04:33.130 --> 02:04:33.571]  So what?
[02:04:33.951 --> 02:04:34.571]  It's training.
[02:04:35.772 --> 02:04:36.852]  What do they say in the military?
[02:04:37.533 --> 02:04:39.173]  Pain is weakness leaving the body.
[02:04:40.414 --> 02:04:45.977]  Well, politically, the political pain is defeat leaving the political spectrum.
[02:04:47.467 --> 02:04:51.734]  And you just gotta go out there and stop caring what people think about you, eh?
[02:04:52.035 --> 02:04:53.337]  And start standing up for what's right.
[02:04:53.357 --> 02:04:55.741]  I mean, we're living in an incredibly historical time.
[02:04:55.781 --> 02:04:57.443]  We got pure evil coming down on us.
[02:05:01.505 --> 02:05:03.146]  Introducing Pro-1.
[02:05:03.406 --> 02:05:06.909]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[02:05:07.049 --> 02:05:11.452]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[02:05:11.572 --> 02:05:17.576]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[02:05:17.696 --> 02:05:28.463]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.
[02:05:28.703 --> 02:05:31.325]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gate.

[02:06:01.255 --> 02:06:03.996]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[02:06:04.276 --> 02:06:09.098]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[02:06:09.298 --> 02:06:16.461]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[02:06:16.601 --> 02:06:22.028]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[02:06:22.248 --> 02:06:25.972]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[02:06:26.273 --> 02:06:30.798]  You've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[02:06:30.999 --> 02:06:36.225]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[02:06:36.445 --> 02:06:39.527]  Strategic Relocation 3rd Edition by Joel Skousen.
[02:06:39.687 --> 02:06:41.929]  When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.

[02:06:46.932 --> 02:06:49.393]  Hand crank shortwave AM FM radios.

[02:06:58.319 --> 02:06:58.720]  Are you?
[02:06:58.980 --> 02:07:00.080]  InfoWarshop.com

[02:08:02.429 --> 02:08:07.513]  There is a signal broadcast every second of every day through our television sets.
[02:08:08.374 --> 02:08:12.597]  Even when the set is turned off, look around at the environment we live in.
[02:08:13.117 --> 02:08:17.261]  Carbon dioxide, fluorocarbons, and methane have increased since 1958.
[02:08:17.721 --> 02:08:21.464]  Earth is being acclimatized.
[02:08:21.544 --> 02:08:25.567]  They are turning our atmosphere into their atmosphere.
[02:08:26.248 --> 02:08:28.530]  We are like a natural resource to them.
[02:08:29.310 --> 02:08:32.552]  Deplete the planet, move on to another.
[02:08:32.612 --> 02:08:34.472]  They want benign indifference.
[02:08:34.973 --> 02:08:36.273]  They want us drugged.
[02:08:36.973 --> 02:08:37.914]  We could be pets.
[02:08:38.494 --> 02:08:39.415]  We could be food.
[02:08:40.035 --> 02:08:43.656]  But all we really are is livestock.
[02:08:43.796 --> 02:08:46.017]  Our impulses are being redirected.
[02:08:46.758 --> 02:08:51.440]  We are living in an artificially induced state of consciousness that resembles sleep.
[02:08:55.836 --> 02:09:01.861]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[02:09:04.930 --> 02:09:06.552]  All right, into hour number three here.
[02:09:06.592 --> 02:09:09.035]  We're here every weekday, 12 noon to 3 p.m.
[02:09:09.095 --> 02:09:09.475]  Eastern.
[02:09:10.216 --> 02:09:11.497]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[02:09:11.537 --> 02:09:21.008]  The news websites are InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and the nightly news site is InfoWarsNews.com or PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:09:21.068 --> 02:09:23.751]  Weeknights, 7 o'clock Central, 8 o'clock Eastern.
[02:09:23.791 --> 02:09:24.331]  Very important.
[02:09:27.014 --> 02:09:29.255]  Or book note or mark that down.
[02:09:29.935 --> 02:09:31.496]  Where to start here today?
[02:09:31.636 --> 02:09:38.898]  There's so much I want to talk about with Max Keiser, who's actually in the Big Apple, New York City right now.
[02:09:39.479 --> 02:09:44.100]  He lives in London where he does his RT show and also syndicated radio.
[02:09:44.160 --> 02:09:46.141]  And he's made the bold prediction.
[02:09:46.181 --> 02:09:53.984]  He's a former top stockbroker, inventor of the virtual trading specialist system used on many stock markets today.
[02:09:54.904 --> 02:09:58.065]  And he is now, of course, retired from that many years ago and is a journalist.
[02:09:58.725 --> 02:10:01.686]  And he's broken a lot of big stories, but he made his boldest prediction ever.
[02:10:02.486 --> 02:10:07.827]  He said he believes that by the end of April, we'll see the end of the bond bubble and that it's going to pop.
[02:10:07.887 --> 02:10:09.767]  And he said that in the middle of last year.
[02:10:10.367 --> 02:10:19.089]  And he's been reporting on signs that just doubly confirm his analysis that late April is the time for that.
[02:10:19.129 --> 02:10:21.090]  So I want to look at what's happening there.
[02:10:22.281 --> 02:10:26.304]  Then I want to segue into the Italians saying no to austerity.
[02:10:27.444 --> 02:10:30.306]  More and more now, the Greeks have seen that it wrecked their country.
[02:10:30.947 --> 02:10:32.388]  Higher taxes brought in less money.
[02:10:32.428 --> 02:10:33.969]  That was the plan, to wreck the country.
[02:10:34.269 --> 02:10:36.851]  They're pulling out of that nosedive, at least on the surface.
[02:10:37.491 --> 02:10:43.855]  And how that ties into the rest of the geopolitical things that we see happening, the stock market and more.
[02:10:43.935 --> 02:10:48.979]  And then, the first guy I ever heard talk about Bitcoin years ago, I forget when, he was the first guy.
[02:10:49.679 --> 02:10:51.420]  Probably secretly invented it for all I know.
[02:10:51.440 --> 02:10:52.181]  There's a rumor for you.
[02:10:52.781 --> 02:10:53.762]  He invented other stuff.
[02:10:53.842 --> 02:10:58.264]  Max Keiser was the first guy I ever heard talk about Bitcoin.
[02:10:58.344 --> 02:11:01.727]  And now, everywhere I go, it's definitely the big buzz.
[02:11:01.787 --> 02:11:02.987]  Bitcoin, Bitcoin, Bitcoin.
[02:11:03.247 --> 02:11:06.549]  So we're going to get to that that's growing exponentially.
[02:11:06.890 --> 02:11:08.571]  And my concern is we don't know who created it.
[02:11:08.951 --> 02:11:10.352]  Anonymity for the individual is fine.
[02:11:10.652 --> 02:11:14.755]  But if we don't know who created it, they could be creating an alternative fiat currency to destroy it.
[02:11:15.615 --> 02:11:19.178]  And then try to discredit the entire movement that I think is a great idea.
[02:11:19.459 --> 02:11:27.025]  I want competing currencies, but Max, I know you're chomping to talk about how you invented Bitcoin, because I got a stinging suspicion you might be involved.
[02:11:27.766 --> 02:11:30.969]  And I know some folks in Austria, too, might be involved, but I'm just going to leave it at that.
[02:11:30.989 --> 02:11:33.651]  I know there's a certain crowd that might be involved.
[02:11:33.911 --> 02:11:36.814]  OK, I think I've said too much, but Max, seriously here.
[02:11:38.215 --> 02:11:40.698]  I'm just concerned they could crash it and then come after everybody.
[02:11:40.718 --> 02:11:42.659]  But let's not go there first.
[02:11:43.160 --> 02:11:45.662]  What is happening with your big predictions, some developments?
[02:11:45.702 --> 02:11:51.928]  I saw you tweet over at Max Keiser, over to real Alex Jones, following us over there at Twitter.
[02:11:52.629 --> 02:12:00.116]  And I'm excited to hear your analysis on this implosion, because I hope you're wrong about it, because I think they'll just get more power out of it.
[02:12:00.216 --> 02:12:01.978]  Max Keiser of MaxKeiser.com.
[02:12:02.398 --> 02:12:04.240]  Yeah, hey Alex, great to be with you.
[02:12:04.781 --> 02:12:07.083]  No, I did not invent Bitcoin.
[02:12:07.143 --> 02:12:14.190]  I think the reason people say that is because I did invent the virtual currency and virtual trading back in 1996.
[02:12:14.230 --> 02:12:15.111]  I have four US patents.
[02:12:18.695 --> 02:12:19.576]  We're good to go.
[02:12:35.706 --> 02:12:45.370]  It's now a $500 million in circulation, and it is taking the globe by storm, and this is the Fed killer.
[02:12:45.630 --> 02:12:57.174]  When Rand Paul says we need to kill the Fed, when Ron Paul says we need to kill the Fed, when I say we need to kill the Fed, Bitcoin potentially is the Fed killer.
[02:12:57.194 --> 02:13:04.537]  Now getting to my prediction, I said on your show eight months ago that within nine months, we would have a major financial catastrophe.
[02:13:05.137 --> 02:13:08.980]  Could most likely be a bond bubble burst, and there could be a number of triggers.
[02:13:09.460 --> 02:13:26.533]  I'm going to claim victory right here, right now, because since I was on your show at that time, Bitcoin has made a move from the $5 to $6 per Bitcoin range to now it's at $46, heading a lot higher.
[02:13:26.553 --> 02:13:29.195]  It's up 200% this year.
[02:13:29.215 --> 02:13:33.699]  There are many Bitcoin millionaires now, myself included, that have become
[02:13:35.199 --> 02:13:45.222]  And in fact, I remember it was 09.
[02:13:46.503 --> 02:13:47.663]  09 you told me to get into Bitcoin.
[02:13:47.763 --> 02:13:48.603]  I probably should have.
[02:13:48.863 --> 02:13:50.344]  My problem is the speculative bubble.
[02:13:50.384 --> 02:13:51.244]  What about it as a bubble?
[02:13:53.172 --> 02:13:53.612]  It's volatile.
[02:13:53.732 --> 02:13:54.873]  It's going to be volatile.
[02:13:55.073 --> 02:13:57.034]  But it doesn't qualify as a bubble.
[02:13:57.054 --> 02:14:05.717]  A bubble would mean there would be oversaturation of people owning it across the spectrum, like NASDAQ stocks in 2000 were a bubble.
[02:14:05.937 --> 02:14:07.137]  The bonds are in a bubble.
[02:14:07.418 --> 02:14:09.218]  The stock market in 87 was a bubble.
[02:14:09.458 --> 02:14:15.381]  Bitcoin is not owned yet by nearly anywhere near the penetration it could get to, Alex.
[02:14:15.441 --> 02:14:17.161]  Let me explain the potential for Bitcoin.
[02:14:17.681 --> 02:14:21.263]  It could conceivably capture 1 to 10% of the global
[02:14:21.783 --> 02:14:22.424]  We're good to go.
[02:14:43.183 --> 02:14:45.285]  Did you just say Bitcoin is the cyber-christ?
[02:15:06.673 --> 02:15:12.014]  Satoshi Nakamoto is the name of the developer who released Bitcoin in 2009.
[02:15:12.434 --> 02:15:18.816]  I call him the Cyber Christ because he potentially is so much of a game changer at this point.
[02:15:18.836 --> 02:15:33.119]  This is such a quantum leap away from the Federal Reserve System that is killing economies around the world that we are going to have a massive global coming to understanding, a revelation.
[02:15:33.699 --> 02:15:38.540]  That finally, we are going to escape the nightmare that is a central bank system.
[02:15:38.761 --> 02:15:40.501]  This thing is a skyrocket.
[02:15:40.861 --> 02:15:44.222]  And the price, yes, is going to be very volatile, so keep that in mind.
[02:15:44.242 --> 02:15:53.205]  You're going to see a lot of price action, but the trajectory is up and has potential to go to $100,000 or a million for Bitcoin from the current price of $46,000.
[02:15:53.345 --> 02:15:57.106]  I suggest you get Rick Favigne from Stockholm on your show.
[02:15:57.706 --> 02:15:59.807]  He's part of the pilot party in Sweden.
[02:16:00.167 --> 02:16:01.408]  He's a great guy.
[02:16:01.568 --> 02:16:10.113]  He's been covering... He put his entire net worth into Bitcoin two years ago, and there was a lot of volatility, but he's got a very down-to-earth analysis of it.
[02:16:10.133 --> 02:16:10.813]  He's a very great guy.
[02:16:10.833 --> 02:16:11.634]  You should have him on your show.
[02:16:13.226 --> 02:16:19.568]  But again, I mean, I know about who supposedly released it, but then it's all very foggy who actually designed it.
[02:16:20.189 --> 02:16:26.611]  And talking to all the insiders, I mean, what you're saying is basically a group of, quote, hackers or IT developers.
[02:16:27.211 --> 02:16:28.212]  I mean, as best we know.
[02:16:29.012 --> 02:16:29.873]  These are activists.
[02:16:29.913 --> 02:16:32.875]  You know, we've been trying to... Look at the politics in America.
[02:16:32.915 --> 02:16:34.776]  Look at what Ron Paul's been saying now for years.
[02:16:34.816 --> 02:16:36.877]  You know, we gotta get rid of the Fed, gotta get rid of the Fed.
[02:16:36.897 --> 02:16:39.399]  And there hasn't been any traction in any movement whatsoever.
[02:16:39.859 --> 02:16:42.941]  And hackers understand that privacy is a big issue going forward.
[02:16:43.301 --> 02:16:49.565]  You know, the privacy is something that is at the heart of what Kim Dotcom in New Zealand is talking about with Mega.
[02:16:49.805 --> 02:16:51.926]  You know, Mega has now got over 50 million users.
[02:16:51.946 --> 02:16:53.407]  It's becoming a billion dollar company.
[02:16:53.447 --> 02:16:54.948]  He called himself a privacy company.
[02:16:54.988 --> 02:16:55.809]  Everything is encrypted.
[02:16:56.129 --> 02:16:57.790]  Just like Bitcoin is entirely encrypted.
[02:16:58.110 --> 02:17:02.112]  Privacy is the new scarcest resource in the world today.
[02:17:02.132 --> 02:17:04.294]  That's what backs Bitcoin, is privacy.
[02:17:04.554 --> 02:17:05.814]  It guarantees privacy.
[02:17:06.155 --> 02:17:14.539]  And in this day and age, that's a very scarce commodity, with every single one of our emails being spied on, with millions of CCTV cameras installed everywhere we go.
[02:17:14.819 --> 02:17:17.081]  Privacy is one of the rarest commodities in the world.
[02:17:17.321 --> 02:17:21.263]  That's what collateralizes, essentially, Bitcoin, and that's why it's such a valuable currency.
[02:17:21.303 --> 02:17:26.766]  And so the activists behind it, this creation, are making that statement against the
[02:17:26.846 --> 02:17:31.088]  Sure, I understand, but Nakamoto is admittedly a fake cutout.
[02:17:31.188 --> 02:17:31.908]  Are you, Nakamoto?
[02:17:31.928 --> 02:17:32.388]  Stop dodging!
[02:17:57.179 --> 02:17:58.800]  And this is your way of getting back at them?
[02:18:25.543 --> 02:18:27.565]  I'm just giving you what's going on in history.
[02:18:27.605 --> 02:18:29.547]  They took those patents out of the public domain.
[02:18:29.807 --> 02:18:36.332]  They in turn moved the company, Canterfish Shell, to the top floor of the World Trade Center, and then they had to deal with their own karmic reality.
[02:18:36.432 --> 02:18:37.373]  That's their gig.
[02:18:37.853 --> 02:18:38.934]  That's just their fate.
[02:18:39.334 --> 02:18:45.439]  But in the meantime, other people who looked at the virtual currency space have said, there is something here that can be done.
[02:18:45.459 --> 02:18:50.143]  The Bitcoin protocol, this encrypted currency that's now on the web,
[02:18:50.743 --> 02:18:52.223]  And it's becoming a huge industry.
[02:18:52.243 --> 02:18:55.004]  There are lots of companies now that support Bitcoin.
[02:18:55.024 --> 02:18:59.645]  For example, there's a company called BitPay that is becoming the PayPal of Bitcoin.
[02:18:59.685 --> 02:19:01.946]  So they guarantee transactions in Bitcoin.
[02:19:01.966 --> 02:19:08.547]  WordPress, which is the biggest, one of the biggest templates for running blogs on the internet now, accepts Bitcoin.
[02:19:09.147 --> 02:19:11.708]  You have stores opening up around the web.
[02:19:11.768 --> 02:19:13.948]  No, no, we're trying to figure out how to accept it as well.
[02:19:16.454 --> 02:19:17.454]  Encrypted currency.
[02:19:17.494 --> 02:19:23.357]  There's no way in the world anyone else could send $1,000 from Alex Jones to anyone in the world for virtually free.
[02:19:23.417 --> 02:19:24.577]  It doesn't cost anything.
[02:19:24.637 --> 02:19:25.738]  It's instantaneous.
[02:19:26.278 --> 02:19:28.859]  And you get 100 cents on the dollar.
[02:19:29.099 --> 02:19:31.780]  The banks hate this because it cuts into their profit margins.
[02:19:32.060 --> 02:19:39.883]  But this is what's needed to do battle against the banking terrorists like JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, Warren Buffett, Federal Reserve.
[02:19:40.203 --> 02:19:41.424]  These guys are going down.
[02:19:41.644 --> 02:19:44.165]  Bitcoin is the spear to take them down.
[02:19:45.265 --> 02:19:45.806]  Amazing.
[02:19:46.206 --> 02:19:48.848]  Now, I want to get into the larger geopolitical issues, but I agree.
[02:19:49.389 --> 02:19:57.116]  True fiat currencies that are open source are what we need to go to, because the globalists... Eight months ago, I predicted that there would be a huge crash.
[02:19:57.856 --> 02:19:58.197]  Stay there.
[02:19:58.217 --> 02:19:58.937]  We got to go to break.
[02:19:58.957 --> 02:19:59.738]  We got to go.
[02:19:59.758 --> 02:20:00.098]  Stay there.
[02:20:02.360 --> 02:20:08.206]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our immunity and health.
[02:20:09.102 --> 02:20:14.985]  At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of silver-based products.

[02:20:26.789 --> 02:20:30.111]  Just released is our 100% natural silver gel.
[02:20:30.931 --> 02:20:37.134]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.
[02:20:37.854 --> 02:20:48.278]  But rather, we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the silver more effectively.

[02:21:01.388 --> 02:21:02.609]  Don't throw away leftovers.
[02:21:02.949 --> 02:21:08.751]  Instead, throw all your leftovers, vegetable peels, eggshells, coffee grounds, pizza crusts, and more into the Bokashi.
[02:21:09.051 --> 02:21:16.973]  If you love to garden and compost, but don't like the hassle of turning a compost bin or the smell, then check out the EM Bokashi Food Waste Recycling System from Terragonics.

[02:21:25.416 --> 02:21:35.183]  Rather than decomposition, the Bokashi system uses fermentation to break down waste, so it takes less time to create nutrient-dense humus for crops or gardens, with no turning and no obnoxious odors.

[02:21:58.275 --> 02:21:58.896]  Terragonics.
[02:21:59.256 --> 02:21:59.956]  Life's getting better.
[02:22:01.156 --> 02:22:04.817]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[02:22:05.217 --> 02:22:10.638]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[02:22:11.119 --> 02:22:12.179]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[02:22:12.219 --> 02:22:16.260]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[02:22:16.920 --> 02:22:30.326]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[02:22:30.726 --> 02:22:36.029]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[02:22:36.329 --> 02:22:42.152]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.

[02:22:48.419 --> 02:22:48.479]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:23:00.620 --> 02:23:04.142]  It's an MRE smorgasbord at longlifefood.com.
[02:23:04.262 --> 02:23:11.507]  In 1983, Long Life Food Depot was one of the first to sell MRE pouches to the public, and we're still selling them almost 30 years later.
[02:23:11.787 --> 02:23:17.711]  Today, Long Life Food Depot has the world's most complete MRE online buffet, because MREs are all we do.

[02:23:27.797 --> 02:23:30.999]  We sell by the pouch or case, so the choices are endless.
[02:23:31.159 --> 02:23:33.341]  And so are the graduated quantity discounts.
[02:23:33.521 --> 02:23:35.502]  The more you buy, the more you save.

[02:23:46.428 --> 02:23:51.110]  Just call 800-601-2833 or visit longlifefood.com.
[02:23:51.390 --> 02:23:52.470]  Emergency preparedness.

[02:23:53.730 --> 02:23:56.211]  Longlifefood.com since 1983.
[02:23:56.511 --> 02:23:58.432]  Sending real food to your real future.
[02:24:07.020 --> 02:24:08.902]  Strange days are here, my friends.
[02:24:09.602 --> 02:24:16.349]  They're going to destroy us.
[02:24:19.660 --> 02:24:21.081]  Unless we make provision.
[02:24:21.122 --> 02:24:22.903]  All right, Max Cousins, our guest.
[02:24:23.564 --> 02:24:25.045]  Bitcoin, very fascinating.
[02:24:25.065 --> 02:24:27.167]  I want to get you back in the next few weeks when you can do it.
[02:24:27.727 --> 02:24:29.969]  Or you're here in the U.S., how about you come down here to Austin?
[02:24:29.989 --> 02:24:36.175]  We'll do a Bitcoin special in studio that can interview you for an upcoming, unannounced new film, folks.
[02:24:36.235 --> 02:24:38.977]  I'm finally going to do it after two years not making a new film.
[02:24:39.778 --> 02:24:42.700]  But Max, getting into your prediction, because you've never made something that bold.
[02:24:45.640 --> 02:24:49.521]  I'm claiming victory, and if anyone wants to debate me on this, they can call me up live.
[02:24:49.561 --> 02:24:52.882]  I'm doing a live radio show this Friday for two hours, starting at 5 p.m.
[02:24:52.902 --> 02:24:54.603]  on PRN in New York City.
[02:24:54.623 --> 02:24:58.064]  You can find it, you can call in, and you can debate me.
[02:24:58.224 --> 02:25:05.686]  But I'm declaring victory on this prediction that I made eight months ago, which makes me the top prognosticator in the world for 2013 so far.
[02:25:07.648 --> 02:25:14.294]  Okay, now break down what your prediction is, and then what's really happening in the economy that you're saying shows that what you said would happen is starting.
[02:25:14.614 --> 02:25:24.603]  Well, I said eight months ago that you'd have a major financial collapse, possibly a bond collapse, and during that time, Bitcoin has made a move from $4 to $46.
[02:25:25.323 --> 02:25:27.425]  It's up 200% this year.
[02:25:27.445 --> 02:25:30.668]  So again, the stock market's trading at a new all-time low against Bitcoin.
[02:25:31.108 --> 02:25:42.659]  I'm claiming Bitcoin to be a global world currency of major importance and everything has crashed against it and will continue to crash against it because all of the hatred of the central banking system is being channeled into Bitcoin right now.
[02:25:43.079 --> 02:25:48.704]  There are so many millions of people around the world who despise what central banks are doing to their economies.
[02:25:48.724 --> 02:25:57.092]  They are now going into Bitcoin and now there's a peripheral economy around Bitcoin with support companies like BitPay that I mentioned and others that are
[02:25:57.732 --> 02:26:00.094]  Making it easier for people to get into this economy.
[02:26:00.414 --> 02:26:02.816]  And as I said, WordPress now accepts Bitcoin.
[02:26:02.856 --> 02:26:04.878]  My side pirate, my film, accepts Bitcoin.
[02:26:04.898 --> 02:26:06.119]  Has been on for a number of months.
[02:26:06.619 --> 02:26:07.880]  And this thing is growing.
[02:26:07.940 --> 02:26:15.186]  I mean, I believe that your outfit should take a look at it and support this because this is the single greatest thing anyone can do to fight against central bankers.
[02:26:15.246 --> 02:26:16.647]  Rand Paul should be on it.
[02:26:16.928 --> 02:26:18.169]  The Libertarians should be on it.
[02:26:18.229 --> 02:26:23.193]  Tom Woods finally, after listening to me for six months, Tom Woods finally has seen the light.
[02:26:23.933 --> 02:26:30.220]  I haven't been balking for three years, but I want to get into some other geopolitical issues other than your invention of Bitcoin.
[02:26:30.580 --> 02:26:31.581]  I want to expand on all of this.
[02:26:44.055 --> 02:26:45.857]  We're seeing major rumblings in Europe.
[02:26:46.097 --> 02:26:49.019]  We're now seeing the prognosticators saying, get ready for collapse.
[02:26:49.419 --> 02:26:51.601]  We're now seeing, get ready for another round of bailouts.
[02:26:51.641 --> 02:26:55.284]  We're seeing people now refusing austerity out of the headlines.
[02:26:55.524 --> 02:26:58.426]  The banks have been saved in Europe, but Europe hasn't been saved.
[02:26:58.446 --> 02:27:01.468]  I'm going to show some of those headlines while you're talking to TV viewers.
[02:27:01.808 --> 02:27:04.290]  I mean, things are definitely rotting faster.
[02:27:04.630 --> 02:27:09.074]  How does that tie into your bond market implosion?
[02:27:10.674 --> 02:27:16.239]  Every point up in the Dow Jones, the federal government takes on $200 million new debt.
[02:27:17.780 --> 02:27:23.365]  They say that the jobless numbers are down and that more people, there's more jobs in the economy.
[02:27:23.485 --> 02:27:32.513]  That's because the number of people taking second and third jobs is now up by hundreds of thousands of people in America now take two and three jobs.
[02:27:32.794 --> 02:27:37.638]  And they count those people taking on second and third jobs as a growth in the jobs number.
[02:27:38.018 --> 02:27:38.359]  I don't know.
[02:27:54.361 --> 02:27:54.841]  We're good to go.
[02:28:24.136 --> 02:28:24.456]  That's good.
[02:28:39.333 --> 02:28:40.254]  We're good to go.
[02:29:03.473 --> 02:29:08.496]  The Bank of England was insisting that America accept money with interest attached to it.
[02:29:08.716 --> 02:29:09.737]  Franklin said no way.
[02:29:09.937 --> 02:29:20.143]  So they created the United States of America and the Constitution, which got rid of this albatross, this monstrosity, the Bank of England, and they brought in real money issued by the Treasury with no interest attached.
[02:29:20.343 --> 02:29:30.490]  Then in 1913, you had the Rothschilds and all those punks from the UK get their way finally, and they brought the Bank of England into America in the form of the Federal Reserve Bank.
[02:29:30.730 --> 02:29:32.671]  And we've seen the debts skyrocket.
[02:29:33.854 --> 02:29:35.916]  Yeah, we've seen the American system killed.
[02:29:35.936 --> 02:29:36.636]  Debt slaves.
[02:29:36.656 --> 02:29:37.777]  Gotta go to break.
[02:29:37.817 --> 02:29:38.437]  Max, stay there.
[02:29:38.498 --> 02:29:41.280]  We're gonna come right back with Max Keiser.
[02:29:41.300 --> 02:29:42.080]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:29:42.120 --> 02:29:42.901]  We're on the march.
[02:29:42.941 --> 02:29:44.662]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:44.702 --> 02:29:46.624]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.877 --> 02:30:04.940]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms.
[02:30:05.280 --> 02:30:10.745]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[02:30:11.326 --> 02:30:14.529]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?

[02:32:01.903 --> 02:32:02.904]  I had tried everything.
[02:32:02.964 --> 02:32:08.028]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating, I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[02:32:08.448 --> 02:32:12.932]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[02:32:13.272 --> 02:32:19.657]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[02:32:20.137 --> 02:32:30.624]  Now, there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[02:32:31.365 --> 02:32:35.488]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[02:32:35.828 --> 02:32:41.852]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[02:32:42.092 --> 02:32:43.233]  Now, that's results.
[02:32:43.653 --> 02:32:55.661]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to Infowarsteam.com and to order just three of their products and you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.
[02:32:56.142 --> 02:32:58.403]  Start your journey to health and wellness today.
[02:32:58.703 --> 02:33:00.424]  Infowarsteam.com.
[02:33:03.827 --> 02:33:11.572]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:35.836 --> 02:33:42.000]  We are back live and we are going to take some calls from Max Keiser here in a few minutes to get into some other financial news that I was just mentioning.
[02:33:42.380 --> 02:33:49.585]  The real currency of liberty in the future is diversity and true independence and liberty.
[02:33:50.526 --> 02:33:55.690]  And it is transmitted through the different conduits of information.
[02:33:56.370 --> 02:34:01.554]  And when the establishment zigs I zag, that's why we're in the seventh issue of InfoWars Magazine.
[02:34:01.654 --> 02:34:03.315]  Big, color, glossy,
[02:34:05.202 --> 02:34:10.344]  The old Rolling Stones style broadsheet full of key information.
[02:34:10.384 --> 02:34:15.986]  We break down the globalist master plan to try to stir up civil war and crises in this country.
[02:34:16.546 --> 02:34:23.208]  You now notice the Southern Poverty Law Center that is the Justice Department is saying I'm a terrorist and prepare for libertarian groups to blow up buildings.
[02:34:24.068 --> 02:34:24.348]  Yeah.
[02:34:24.828 --> 02:34:26.089]  How do you demonize your enemies?
[02:34:26.892 --> 02:34:28.313]  You stage stuff and blame it on them.
[02:34:28.393 --> 02:34:29.733]  I mean, it is so transparent.
[02:34:30.154 --> 02:34:33.995]  It's all broken down in the new issue and it's going to sell out this month.
[02:34:34.556 --> 02:34:36.597]  It's already, most of them have already sold.
[02:34:37.057 --> 02:34:41.859]  The $30,000 we keep back, we put $70,000 on the streets in Austin and San Antonio.
[02:34:41.979 --> 02:34:47.182]  Texas, the beta test, when it's a year old, will go into syndication in cities across the United States.
[02:34:47.742 --> 02:34:48.703]  We're gearing up for that.
[02:34:49.843 --> 02:34:53.585]  A lot of legwork to do, but thank you for supporting InfoWars Magazine.
[02:34:53.605 --> 02:34:54.886]  You can buy them at cost.
[02:34:55.831 --> 02:35:03.614]  At cost at InfoWarsStore.com or sign up for a 12 month subscription and the shipping is included in the cost of the subscription.
[02:35:04.554 --> 02:35:05.495]  So it's all there.
[02:35:05.515 --> 02:35:07.875]  You can also become a micro distributor.
[02:35:07.895 --> 02:35:09.156]  I haven't talked about this yet.
[02:35:09.196 --> 02:35:22.601]  You can get the InfoWars News Rack and buy them in groups of 50 up to 100 at cost and sign up and have 12 issues mailed to you to sell them at your business or office or gas station and make the money back
[02:35:23.261 --> 02:35:27.484]  Or just as a public service, let people take them for free.
[02:35:28.625 --> 02:35:30.826]  But regardless, you can become a micro-distributor.
[02:35:31.186 --> 02:35:43.354]  They have different deals on that one-time micro-distributor to buy the rack in one month to test it out or sign up for 12 months and get 50 to 100 or even more mailed to you each month to put in your store, business, church, whatever the case is.
[02:35:43.374 --> 02:35:48.858]  Because people really pay attention to a big color glossy magazine now because magazines are going the way of the Goonie Bird.
[02:35:49.318 --> 02:35:50.419]  Now there's a vacuum there.
[02:35:51.019 --> 02:35:53.081]  And of course, financially, that doesn't really support us.
[02:35:53.121 --> 02:35:59.125]  Be sure and buy the ProPure water filters, the books, the videos, the t-shirts, all of it at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:35:59.626 --> 02:36:06.831]  And be sure and follow us, because I got into the Twitter game late, but only now do I realize I can send photos, video links.
[02:36:07.512 --> 02:36:09.153]  It's such an important tool for us.
[02:36:09.173 --> 02:36:10.995]  We only have 170,000 followers.
[02:36:11.395 --> 02:36:13.396]  We have a couple other Twitters that were fan Twitters.
[02:36:13.416 --> 02:36:14.017]  We've got about 400,000 total.
[02:36:16.109 --> 02:36:17.470]  That needs to be at a million.
[02:36:18.410 --> 02:36:21.612]  But it's kind of a pop culture thing, so that's why we've not been super successful at it.
[02:36:21.632 --> 02:36:23.452]  I want to thank those that have helped promote it.
[02:36:23.532 --> 02:36:25.913]  Real Alex Jones there at Twitter.
[02:36:25.973 --> 02:36:26.854]  Go and follow us.
[02:36:26.914 --> 02:36:27.794]  It's very easy to do.
[02:36:28.214 --> 02:36:32.356]  We send a lot of key information out, like Report Mid-East War on Bilderberg 2013 Agenda.
[02:36:34.330 --> 02:36:46.799]  All the breaking news is tweeted out from InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and be sure and follow Max as well because his information is very important at Max Kaiser there on Twitter.
[02:36:46.819 --> 02:36:50.962]  But DHS to purchase more firearms as arms buildup intensifies.
[02:36:51.522 --> 02:36:52.683]  New Paul Watson article.
[02:36:53.183 --> 02:36:55.465]  The police will protect you so turn in your guns.
[02:36:56.586 --> 02:36:59.568]  And there's now been a group of sheriffs have come out
[02:37:00.228 --> 02:37:02.690]  And so they were ordered to have their pay cut in Colorado.
[02:37:02.710 --> 02:37:04.351]  I guess the state's in control of that.
[02:37:04.371 --> 02:37:05.152]  The county should be.
[02:37:05.792 --> 02:37:07.494]  And so they were ordered to be anti-gun.
[02:37:07.554 --> 02:37:08.875]  Man, you talk about crazy.
[02:37:09.936 --> 02:37:13.658]  So that article is up there as well.
[02:37:13.718 --> 02:37:17.922]  Max, I want to throw a few curveballs at you before we get back to the economy and take calls.
[02:37:19.378 --> 02:37:43.250]  What do you make of the stonewalling about the 2,700 giant armored vehicles, the tens of thousands of fully auto machine guns the government's buying, like 7,000 a month, the two billion bullets, and then the stonewalling saying it doesn't exist, but now even Forbes has come out and said, we looked at it, there are the billions of bullets, why are you stonewalling?
[02:37:43.650 --> 02:37:46.871]  We need to, quote, have a national discussion about this.
[02:37:46.911 --> 02:37:47.692]  That's the headline.
[02:37:48.552 --> 02:37:49.632]  And that's what I've been saying.
[02:37:49.773 --> 02:37:51.053]  There is an arms buildup.
[02:37:51.413 --> 02:37:52.333]  There are checkpoints.
[02:37:52.353 --> 02:37:56.955]  They're gearing up as if a foreign army is about to invade, but they're pointed at us.
[02:37:57.495 --> 02:37:59.755]  The manuals say it's for gun confiscation.
[02:38:00.015 --> 02:38:01.556]  That will cause a civil war.
[02:38:01.916 --> 02:38:11.659]  And I know, I don't believe, because it's in their internal memos that they've leaked, they want to start a civil war and label those of us that don't go along with having our pension funds taken, guns taken,
[02:38:12.239 --> 02:38:13.420]  They're gonna label us terrorists.
[02:38:13.860 --> 02:38:18.383]  Max Keiser, what do you make of the... The stonewalling undoubtedly has gotten more bizarre.
[02:38:18.403 --> 02:38:23.105]  It's like Gibbs saying there are no drone programs seven years after the program was public.
[02:38:23.425 --> 02:38:25.467]  And then admitting, aha, it's Wizard of Oz.
[02:38:25.787 --> 02:38:27.048]  What is the tactic there?
[02:38:27.108 --> 02:38:31.650]  And why is the lying, or do you disagree, becoming so over-the-top cartoon?
[02:38:31.930 --> 02:38:32.911]  Well, they're frightened.
[02:38:33.791 --> 02:38:34.272]  They're frightened.
[02:38:34.832 --> 02:38:36.453]  I mean, listen to what Eric Calder just said.
[02:38:37.242 --> 02:38:45.226]  He said, yes, it's true that HSBC got caught laundering billions of dollars for Mexican drug cartel terrorists.
[02:38:46.187 --> 02:38:56.192]  Yes, it's true that Wachovia was caught laundering $400 billion worth of Mexican drug money, which is Wachovia's now, was bought by Wells Fargo, biggest shareholder is now Warren Buffett.
[02:38:56.892 --> 02:38:59.734]  We can't prosecute because I fear them.
[02:39:01.010 --> 02:39:01.930]  That's the Attorney General.
[02:39:17.295 --> 02:39:20.897]  They went into the Holy Land and had to build fortresses inside the Holy Land.
[02:39:21.217 --> 02:39:27.120]  They're building themselves fortresses because they're afraid of their bankers, the monstrous bankers that they've created.
[02:39:27.521 --> 02:39:29.242]  They can't apply laws to them.
[02:39:29.562 --> 02:39:30.582]  They can't enter them.
[02:39:31.003 --> 02:39:35.685]  These guys, they'll know that they're in league with the Mexican drug cartel, the terrorists.
[02:39:36.045 --> 02:39:37.146]  They're trying to protect themselves.
[02:39:37.166 --> 02:39:37.866]  They're scared to death.
[02:39:38.126 --> 02:39:41.808]  Eric Holder is a scared little bunny, hopping around saying, oh my God, H.H.P.C.
[02:39:41.849 --> 02:39:42.689]  is on the line!
[02:39:42.729 --> 02:39:43.790]  Please save me!
[02:39:43.850 --> 02:39:45.591]  Obama, hide me!
[02:39:45.631 --> 02:39:46.331]  H.H.P.C., Stephen Hester!
[02:39:50.976 --> 02:39:54.697]  This guy is the most frightened little weenie hopper, bunny hopping loser.
[02:39:55.218 --> 02:40:03.181]  America, this is a sad day when you've got the Attorney General saying he's afraid of the banks, he can't prosecute even though they funded 9-11 terrorism.
[02:40:03.861 --> 02:40:06.602]  Why are we sending drones across the ocean?
[02:40:06.642 --> 02:40:06.982]  For what?
[02:40:07.002 --> 02:40:07.803]  To kill who?
[02:40:08.343 --> 02:40:09.943]  Little babies in their crib?
[02:40:10.263 --> 02:40:16.806]  Because Eric Holder has his little crotch all shrunken up and shriveling up like a peanut because he's not a man enough to admit that he funded 9-11?
[02:40:17.307 --> 02:40:19.932]  Control your hatred, Lord Vader!
[02:40:30.610 --> 02:40:33.933]  Now, let me just expand on this, because I have the articles right here for TV viewers.
[02:40:34.433 --> 02:40:37.095]  What do you make of Mohammed Karzai coming out?
[02:40:37.135 --> 02:40:39.356]  Because we know the West runs Al-Qaeda and Taliban.
[02:40:39.537 --> 02:40:41.118]  That's been admitted literally hundreds of times.
[02:40:41.158 --> 02:40:44.060]  Number two in Al-Qaeda and we're all locking, hanging out at the Pentagon.
[02:40:44.460 --> 02:40:47.803]  But now he's another cornered rat, so the rats are fighting with each other.
[02:40:48.123 --> 02:40:50.765]  He knows they killed his brother, the biggest opium dealer, to get his cut.
[02:40:51.685 --> 02:40:57.067]  He now comes out and says, you've been bombing your own bases, you've been bombing our hotels, as a reason to stay here.
[02:40:57.167 --> 02:41:03.469]  And I said that a year ago at the last big one, six months ago, a smaller one, because it clearly is that.
[02:41:04.449 --> 02:41:11.312]  Clearly, they are in league with HSBC, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds of London.
[02:41:11.792 --> 02:41:14.853]  No, but I mean, now it's coming out that the troops grow the drugs.
[02:41:18.973 --> 02:41:20.654]  That's why you invented it?
[02:41:20.674 --> 02:41:22.054]  But don't the elites get... Let me say something.
[02:41:46.752 --> 02:41:47.152]  I think so.
[02:41:59.116 --> 02:42:07.439]  Because people in the liberty movement, people who are following Rand Paul, Ron Paul, libertarians, Austrian school, they finally came around to my way of thinking.
[02:42:07.759 --> 02:42:12.001]  I had to school Tom Woods, I had to school Rand Paul, and say, look, this is the future.
[02:42:12.081 --> 02:42:25.326]  Now they're coming around, which is great, because now this thing is going to be adopted by millions more people, and these central bankers and commercial bankers and Wall Street bankers are going to be exterminated, disenfranchised, whittled out of existence.
[02:42:26.135 --> 02:42:30.599]  Alright, let me... Let's move slowly here for a few points because I want to get to this.
[02:42:30.619 --> 02:42:32.701]  Yes, it's a big deal.
[02:42:37.688 --> 02:42:44.330]  I don't know if you saw it, but if you go to intrade.com, intrade.com, that's been taken off.
[02:42:44.791 --> 02:42:45.791]  That's been taken offline.
[02:42:46.091 --> 02:42:47.031]  That's been shut down.
[02:42:47.051 --> 02:42:50.073]  Suddenly, at 3 o'clock in the morning, just a few hours ago.
[02:42:50.613 --> 02:43:01.637]  Because intrade.com was giving true price discovery on probability for events that were happening and for prices of things that were outside of the matrix of these corrupt bankers.
[02:43:02.037 --> 02:43:04.398]  The insiders are the only ones that are supposed to know that.
[02:43:06.465 --> 02:43:06.885]  Sure, I understand.
[02:43:06.925 --> 02:43:08.066]  Let me ask you this question.
[02:43:08.146 --> 02:43:08.767]  Yeah, I understand.
[02:43:08.807 --> 02:43:10.088]  You're pretty wound up today, Max.
[02:43:35.202 --> 02:43:36.645]  No, no, I understand that's breaking news.
[02:43:37.127 --> 02:43:39.813]  I want to go to some phone calls here in just a moment.
[02:43:39.833 --> 02:43:44.664]  People want to talk to you about Bitcoin and bonds and some other questions, but Max...
[02:43:45.717 --> 02:43:46.677]  Take North Korea.
[02:43:47.878 --> 02:43:52.420]  Obviously, you've got Dennis Rodman, a washed-up media whore, going over there.
[02:43:52.500 --> 02:44:01.285]  But the way people made a joke out of a murdering dictator meeting with an American like tyranny's funny, it also shows the decadence of some of the public.
[02:44:01.585 --> 02:44:14.071]  But then as a larger issue, as North Korea insanely threatens to nuke things and cuts off the telephone connection and ends the armistice, so the Korean War, out of deep freeze 59 years later, is back.
[02:44:14.911 --> 02:44:19.913]  What is your take on North Korea and how that feeds into things in the build-up towards the Middle East war?
[02:44:19.933 --> 02:44:20.713]  No, I know.
[02:44:20.733 --> 02:44:24.914]  So it was a ceasefire for the armistice, but it was an armistice meeting for a ceasefire.
[02:44:24.934 --> 02:44:25.154]  Go ahead.
[02:44:31.986 --> 02:44:34.347]  Well, Eric Schmidt's a lot more powerful than Kerry.
[02:44:59.688 --> 02:44:59.908]  I know.
[02:45:00.188 --> 02:45:01.869]  What do you think's happening in North Korea?
[02:45:01.929 --> 02:45:03.230]  How does North Korea feed into things?
[02:45:29.150 --> 02:45:30.612]  Sure, how does North Korea tie into this?
[02:45:32.073 --> 02:45:43.205]  But you notice that before a big collapse, wars always start, because that helps smokescreen the globalist takeover, and I see in the Middle East and North Korea, I mean it looks like things could be lining up for something really nasty.
[02:45:43.445 --> 02:45:44.967]  What do you expect to see, Max Keiser?
[02:45:47.236 --> 02:45:49.817]  You've got Japan and China are fighting a currency war.
[02:45:50.117 --> 02:45:52.858]  You've got North Korea is now starting to fight a hot war.
[02:45:53.119 --> 02:45:57.240]  You've got Europe involved in a massive social unrest in the periphery countries.
[02:45:57.581 --> 02:46:03.043]  America is dissolving into a new kleptocracy and anti-Bellum South slave state.
[02:46:03.643 --> 02:46:07.665]  And you've got Venezuela now in chaos with the passing of Chavez.
[02:46:08.165 --> 02:46:10.866]  And you know, you've got hot spots all over the world and no leadership.
[02:46:10.966 --> 02:46:11.627]  That's the problem.
[02:46:11.647 --> 02:46:14.228]  Because the leaders are buying their own bull.
[02:46:16.015 --> 02:46:17.456]  Because the leaders are buying their own bull.
[02:46:17.516 --> 02:46:23.919]  I think that's the big issue here, is that when the establishments start smoking their own dope, get ready for cuckoo land.
[02:46:23.939 --> 02:46:30.203]  I also predicted on your show six months ago to a year ago that the British Pound would make new lows against all major trading currencies.
[02:46:30.283 --> 02:46:30.663]  You did?
[02:46:30.683 --> 02:46:35.326]  I know today that it's just made a new low against all its major trading currencies.
[02:46:35.346 --> 02:46:38.587]  So that's another prediction for 2013 that I put in the win column.
[02:46:38.647 --> 02:46:39.548]  I'm batting 1,000.
[02:46:39.888 --> 02:46:41.149]  I am the prognosticator of 2013.
[02:46:44.025 --> 02:46:44.765]  We've got to go to calls.
[02:46:44.805 --> 02:46:45.886]  Let me ask you one last question.
[02:46:46.966 --> 02:46:48.667]  I agree things are degenerating quickly.
[02:46:48.927 --> 02:46:52.968]  They're talking about all sorts of economic unraveling, while saying everything's great to the general public.
[02:46:53.248 --> 02:46:56.069]  But the more internal memos are, oh, you know, danger Will Robinson.
[02:46:56.589 --> 02:47:00.831]  So, they're going to spin even an all-out depression as milk and honey.
[02:47:01.371 --> 02:47:02.771]  Like they've spun things in Greece.
[02:47:02.872 --> 02:47:06.153]  Children starving to death is a wonderful thing, and Greece is doing great.
[02:47:07.433 --> 02:47:09.594]  So, if you're right about the collapse accelerating,
[02:47:10.922 --> 02:47:24.677]  How will the public respond as the media announces the economy's great, there are no bullets, there are no checkpoints, there are no armored vehicles, the TSA doesn't grab your genitals, the Easter Bunny is real, Santa Claus is real, there are no drones.
[02:47:26.766 --> 02:47:28.927]  I think the public has missed their window of opportunity.
[02:47:28.947 --> 02:47:36.192]  The Constitution says under Second Amendment, if tyranny comes along, you have a constitutional obligation to pick up your firearm and take back your government.
[02:47:36.512 --> 02:47:40.915]  The threshold for that tyranny has passed already in the year 2000 with that election.
[02:47:41.235 --> 02:47:47.379]  We've had now 15 or 20 instances when tyranny threshold, as per the Constitution, has been passed.
[02:47:47.659 --> 02:47:50.321]  The NDAA, the Patriot Act, the list goes on and on.
[02:47:50.601 --> 02:47:51.902]  America did not act.
[02:47:52.202 --> 02:47:53.283]  I disagree with that.
[02:47:53.303 --> 02:47:54.183]  I disagree with that.
[02:47:54.203 --> 02:47:57.165]  There's more of an awakening now than ever.
[02:47:57.185 --> 02:48:00.246]  I totally disagree with that, Max, and I understand that... I know you disagree with it!
[02:48:00.266 --> 02:48:03.928]  Yeah, well, you're... Listen... What threshold of tyranny are you looking at?
[02:48:21.673 --> 02:48:22.334]  What does it take?
[02:48:22.374 --> 02:48:30.719]  Does John Kerry have to come into your home and physically, you know, perform an act, a disgraceful act, you know, in person?
[02:48:30.779 --> 02:48:33.000]  I mean, what is it going to take?
[02:48:33.060 --> 02:48:40.565]  What more degrading, degrading act by your government do you need before you... Hey, what's stopping you?
[02:48:40.845 --> 02:48:44.707]  Listen, the feds are going to blow stuff up and blame it on us.
[02:48:45.027 --> 02:48:47.169]  They want a confrontation.
[02:48:47.489 --> 02:48:50.891]  They want to get a physical fight going because we're winning the info war.
[02:48:59.830 --> 02:49:02.192]  No, it takes a lot of tyranny before it doesn't.
[02:49:02.212 --> 02:49:04.934]  Listen, people are waking up big time right now, Max.
[02:49:04.954 --> 02:49:05.634]  Let's go to a phone call.
[02:49:06.054 --> 02:49:11.778]  Scott in Colorado wants to ask a bond question, then we'll go to others that have Bitcoin questions and others.
[02:49:11.798 --> 02:49:12.439]  Go ahead, Scott.
[02:49:12.459 --> 02:49:15.661]  You're on the air with Max Keiser, who's had a lot of coffee.
[02:49:16.570 --> 02:49:19.691]  Hey Max, first time caller, Alex, love the show.
[02:49:20.251 --> 02:49:23.532]  Wanted to know, more importantly, when do you think the derivative markets are going to crash?
[02:49:23.592 --> 02:49:28.894]  I mean, I can't understand what America's looking at when they look over to Europe.
[02:49:29.094 --> 02:49:33.436]  I mean, you've got Ireland going broke, you've got Spain that can't control their debt, their GDP's out of control.
[02:49:33.456 --> 02:49:36.637]  Those countries don't exist, the bullets don't exist, everything's fine.
[02:49:37.768 --> 02:49:47.515]  I mean, I've even got guys that, you know, are VPs over at Wells Fargo that say, yeah, we see a 5 to 10 percent market correction, but other than that, we don't see the bond market or the derivatives market seeing a major correction.
[02:49:47.535 --> 02:50:02.785]  Right, well, the derivative market, otherwise known as the shadow banking system, is completely opaque, totally unregulated, and we never see or hear about it until things like the London Whale a few months ago blew up, and Jamie Dimon and Jacob Morgan launched what, six or seven or nine years ago?
[02:50:02.805 --> 02:50:03.145]  It's LIBOR!
[02:50:03.185 --> 02:50:03.886]  It's all reg!
[02:50:08.183 --> 02:50:09.184]  To the real world.
[02:50:09.224 --> 02:50:22.863]  So behind the scenes in the shadow system, there are all these catastrophes and losses being made up, but we don't really see it until it makes its way into a formal policy initiative which is called Austerity in Europe.
[02:50:23.563 --> 02:50:27.405]  Or Obamacare in America, which is a huge bailout of the corporation.
[02:50:27.545 --> 02:50:30.547]  And what, net-net, wages go down, quality of life goes down.
[02:50:30.567 --> 02:50:38.611]  America right now, on the League of Nations in the world, for standard of living, quality of life, is a whopping number 16!
[02:50:38.991 --> 02:50:39.411]  Number 16!
[02:50:40.512 --> 02:50:43.173]  Down from number 1, and heading to number 40.
[02:50:43.653 --> 02:50:45.154]  Okay, that's where it shows up.
[02:50:45.234 --> 02:50:47.215]  That's the crisis in the derivatives market.
[02:50:47.395 --> 02:50:48.296]  Alright, Scott, thanks.
[02:50:48.356 --> 02:50:49.336]  Gotta go to break, Max.
[02:50:49.376 --> 02:50:50.797]  Max needs Ritalin.
[02:50:53.980 --> 02:50:57.102]  Turning back up, let him take us out of the break.
[02:50:57.122 --> 02:50:59.283]  Okay, Max, we're going to come right back to you.
[02:51:00.104 --> 02:51:01.845]  George Braun Tate Ryan.
[02:51:02.205 --> 02:51:05.707]  If you're listening, you know your basic freedoms are being threatened every day.
[02:51:05.987 --> 02:51:09.069]  If you're listening, you know the economy is not getting better.
[02:51:09.249 --> 02:51:11.670]  You know gas and food prices are skyrocketing.
[02:51:12.050 --> 02:51:13.991]  Now is the time to get prepared.
[02:51:14.191 --> 02:51:17.033]  For years we've told you about our friends at eFoods Direct.

[02:52:04.208 --> 02:52:09.932]  Did you know that mercury from your dental fillings comes off your teeth both as a vapor and as metal particles into your body?
[02:52:10.052 --> 02:52:13.795]  Wherever mercury deposits in your body, it stops cells from functioning normally.
[02:52:14.055 --> 02:52:16.857]  Animal studies show that mercury causes kidney function to drop by 60%.
[02:52:17.978 --> 02:52:18.338]  I don't know.
[02:52:35.760 --> 02:52:47.963]  After investigating most high-end whey proteins on the market, only one is the most non-denatured, the most active, the most complete, and in our opinion, the most powerful, in what nature originally put into the fresh raw whey.

[02:54:45.926 --> 02:54:48.206]  Let's talk to a Bitcoin question.
[02:54:48.287 --> 02:54:49.287]  Kate in Michigan.
[02:54:49.607 --> 02:54:50.867]  You're on the air with Max Keiser.
[02:54:50.907 --> 02:54:51.267]  Go ahead.
[02:54:52.408 --> 02:54:57.089]  Hey Max, I wanted to tell you, you and Stacy at Rockstar are doing man, love what you're doing.
[02:54:57.229 --> 02:54:59.150]  I'm a member of your Silver Liberation Army.
[02:54:59.450 --> 02:55:00.750]  My question is this.
[02:55:01.450 --> 02:55:06.652]  Is Bitcoin a good alternative to dual citizenship for wealth protection?
[02:55:08.800 --> 02:55:22.071]  I guess the short answer is yes, because it's highly portable, so you could put $100,000 on a thumb drive, or even memorize the address, and you could go anywhere in the world and upload that information, and there'd be your $100,000.
[02:55:22.431 --> 02:55:29.077]  So it's a way to completely bypass the... No, it is a giant idea and revolutionary, and I'm all for it.
[02:55:29.457 --> 02:55:37.484]  I'm just saying the first big vehicle to be successful will probably be brought down by the system, or it will bring the system down, so it's a big deal.
[02:55:38.997 --> 02:55:40.338]  Well, I don't know what you just said.
[02:55:42.919 --> 02:55:43.259]  Pardon me?
[02:55:43.919 --> 02:55:45.000]  I don't know what you just said.
[02:55:45.040 --> 02:56:02.187]  I mean, you're just agreeing that it's a huge initiative, it's big, and I don't understand why there's not more... No, I'm just saying people... Listen, I'm just saying... You're the only guy banging the drum on Bitcoin in the alternative media space since it started in 2009.
[02:56:02.527 --> 02:56:05.709]  No, well, Max, I had you on about it today, and I've had you on before.
[02:56:09.093 --> 02:56:09.353]  I know.
[02:56:09.613 --> 02:56:13.034]  I'm just saying there's risk for people that don't have a lot of money.
[02:56:13.094 --> 02:56:18.855]  I think people that have a lot of money should all put a little bit into it politically just to try to make it successful.
[02:56:19.155 --> 02:56:25.577]  But I'm also up here saying anything experimental or exploratory has serious dangers.
[02:56:25.637 --> 02:56:28.177]  But the bigger system is the ultimate danger.
[02:56:28.237 --> 02:56:30.297]  So that's why I've supported you in the Silver Army.
[02:56:30.718 --> 02:56:32.018]  I supported you on the Bitcoin.
[02:56:32.338 --> 02:56:37.039]  I understand you're really excited about your invention doing so well today, but calm down right now.
[02:56:38.223 --> 02:56:40.084]  Okay, Tate, anything else?
[02:56:41.105 --> 02:56:42.046]  I know you guys keep it up.
[02:56:42.106 --> 02:56:43.306]  Love what you're doing.
[02:56:43.326 --> 02:56:44.027]  Thank you very much.
[02:56:44.047 --> 02:56:45.168]  I appreciate it, Tate.
[02:56:45.528 --> 02:56:47.449]  Let's talk to George in Connecticut.
[02:56:47.469 --> 02:56:49.130]  You're on the air with Max Keiser.
[02:56:49.931 --> 02:56:53.293]  Yeah, I'd like to talk to that financial terrorist, Mr. Max Keiser.
[02:56:53.333 --> 02:56:56.095]  I mean, the poor bankers are probably peeing their pants right now.
[02:56:56.175 --> 02:57:02.459]  Anyway, the question is, Ken, what's the best place to be if the market does blow up
[02:57:03.211 --> 02:57:06.273]  Because of this bubble that's going to happen in April.
[02:57:06.654 --> 02:57:07.715]  Should we be in gold?
[02:57:08.075 --> 02:57:09.196]  Is GLD okay?
[02:57:09.416 --> 02:57:10.677]  That's so leveraged, that's bad.
[02:57:11.117 --> 02:57:12.598]  Or should we be completely out?
[02:57:12.778 --> 02:57:14.160]  Et cetera, et cetera.
[02:57:14.180 --> 02:57:17.922]  And what are the indicators that might basically be leading?
[02:57:17.942 --> 02:57:18.623]  Sure, Max.
[02:57:18.643 --> 02:57:19.764]  Max, and then I'll tell you what I'd do.
[02:57:19.844 --> 02:57:23.727]  Gold, silver, real estate, friends, family, storable food, skills.
[02:57:23.767 --> 02:57:24.147]  Go ahead.
[02:57:25.108 --> 02:57:28.691]  Well, you know, the problem is that the Ponzi scheme and paper
[02:57:29.318 --> 02:57:33.901]  I think that's a pretty good suggestion, and I think you should be handing out pampers to those banksters.
[02:57:58.351 --> 02:57:58.691]  Yeah.
[02:57:59.171 --> 02:58:04.254]  No, I tell you, I mean, they have, they've done what so many corrupt groups have done.
[02:58:04.274 --> 02:58:05.334]  They've overreached.
[02:58:05.354 --> 02:58:08.536]  And they're even getting rid of the due process that protected them.
[02:58:09.296 --> 02:58:10.937]  They really are crazy, aren't they, Max?
[02:58:13.191 --> 02:58:15.172]  It's a suicide mission, you know.
[02:58:15.232 --> 02:58:19.574]  They are pathologically insane, and they're going to keep going.
[02:58:19.614 --> 02:58:20.394]  I mean, they're cancer.
[02:58:20.414 --> 02:58:23.496]  So cancer will keep going until the host is destroyed.
[02:58:23.816 --> 02:58:28.918]  So these banksters will not stop until the host, that is to say the United States and the global economy, is destroyed.
[02:58:28.938 --> 02:58:29.959]  That's their goal.
[02:58:31.279 --> 02:58:31.839]  Unbelievable.
[02:58:31.879 --> 02:58:32.560]  Max, don't hang up.
[02:58:32.580 --> 02:58:33.680]  We'll do a few more minutes with you.
[02:58:33.740 --> 02:58:34.961]  Some more callers have got questions.
[02:58:35.001 --> 02:58:35.421]  You can do that.

[03:00:18.175 --> 03:00:22.280]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:32.688 --> 03:00:34.009]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:00:34.910 --> 03:00:36.291]  We've got Max Keiser on with us.
[03:00:36.331 --> 03:00:36.972]  Thank you for joining us.
[03:00:37.092 --> 03:00:38.052]  Ryan in Texas.
[03:00:38.533 --> 03:00:39.694]  You're on the air with Max Keiser.
[03:00:39.714 --> 03:00:42.756]  Go ahead.
[03:00:42.856 --> 03:00:46.719]  Man, these phones are so bad, I can't understand a word you're saying, bud.
[03:00:47.620 --> 03:00:48.981]  Try to talk right into your phone, Ryan.
[03:00:50.402 --> 03:00:52.064]  Oh, hey, I had a question.
[03:00:52.204 --> 03:00:54.686]  One, Alex, we need to get you back on in Dallas.
[03:00:54.726 --> 03:00:59.269]  But two, Matt, are we still looking at
[03:01:00.962 --> 03:01:12.370]  April for the little stock market bubble crash and also, where do you see silver and gold going at that time because it's been down the last few months?
[03:01:13.291 --> 03:01:17.113]  Well, I'm claiming victory because everything against Bitcoin has crashed.
[03:01:17.674 --> 03:01:19.335]  So I'm claiming victory.
[03:01:19.695 --> 03:01:23.638]  As far as gold and silver, continue to see them as they have for the past 12 years.
[03:01:23.958 --> 03:01:25.980]  Every single one of the 12 years, they've gone up.
[03:01:26.200 --> 03:01:27.861]  So I'm looking for them to continue to go up.
[03:01:29.835 --> 03:01:31.557]  Okay, I hope that answers your question, sir.
[03:01:31.597 --> 03:01:32.237]  God bless you.
[03:01:32.277 --> 03:01:39.764]  Yeah, and our Dallas affiliate, after about two years carrying us with a huge listenership, changed formats to another format, and that happens.
[03:01:40.184 --> 03:01:45.008]  Some of these stations were on, we were number one in Orlando, sold it, they turned to ESPN Sports.
[03:01:45.989 --> 03:01:47.611]  So ratings don't matter anymore, folks.
[03:01:47.651 --> 03:01:49.392]  It's important to support the broadcast.
[03:01:49.893 --> 03:01:52.275]  But we're gaining more affiliates than we lose, so that's the good news.
[03:01:54.076 --> 03:01:54.697]  Yeah, it's incredible.
[03:01:54.717 --> 03:01:54.937]  I mean...
[03:02:06.852 --> 03:02:09.933]  I mean, I get number one ratings everywhere where I'm put on a decent station.
[03:02:09.953 --> 03:02:11.774]  Even in the little stations I can get the top ratings.
[03:02:11.794 --> 03:02:19.458]  I mean, I beat Rush Limbaugh in every demographic on a 10,000 watt station up against a 50,000 watt in Orlando.
[03:02:19.478 --> 03:02:25.260]  Yeah, but if you're Rush Limbaugh, you get a huge subsidy from the government to broadcast propaganda.
[03:02:25.540 --> 03:02:28.902]  He is the, basically, Tokyo Rose of America.
[03:02:28.922 --> 03:02:29.942]  He's a propagandist.
[03:02:29.962 --> 03:02:31.483]  He gets a huge government subsidy.
[03:02:31.923 --> 03:02:33.224]  He's a Nat Turner.
[03:02:34.704 --> 03:02:37.285]  How does he get a government subsidy?
[03:02:37.405 --> 03:02:56.794]  Well, he cuts a deal for $400 million, and the broadcaster that carries them, of course, is an entity that promises never to carry anything on its network that would anyone find offensive in any single way, so they give them huge licenses, and the government allows them to consolidate their media footprint.
[03:02:57.194 --> 03:03:00.315]  You know, there's very few broadcasters in America that that's a subsidy.
[03:03:00.415 --> 03:03:01.636]  That's welfare from the government.
[03:03:02.356 --> 03:03:04.417]  Yeah, MSNBC definitely is.
[03:03:04.457 --> 03:03:06.077]  Let's talk to Judy in Florida.
[03:03:06.097 --> 03:03:06.937]  Judy, you're on the air.
[03:03:07.157 --> 03:03:07.877]  Hi Alex, it's Judy.
[03:03:07.897 --> 03:03:08.938]  Can you hear me?
[03:03:08.958 --> 03:03:09.398]  I can.
[03:03:09.458 --> 03:03:11.198]  Throw your question out, please.
[03:03:27.762 --> 03:03:28.102]  Sure.
[03:03:29.142 --> 03:03:30.263]  This is a serious one, too.
[03:03:30.283 --> 03:03:32.183]  This is the second time I've gotten to speak to Max.
[03:03:32.303 --> 03:03:33.224]  This is great.
[03:03:33.884 --> 03:03:43.526]  What about the prospect of what they're trying to put in Congress, or through Congress, through LaRouche Political Action Committee, on Glass-Steagall?
[03:03:44.147 --> 03:03:49.108]  And if Glass-Steagall was... I mean, it's a great idea, but it never happens because the criminals run things, Max.
[03:03:49.268 --> 03:03:50.048]  Yep, I agree.
[03:03:50.128 --> 03:03:50.668]  It never happened.
[03:03:51.709 --> 03:03:52.909]  Great idea, but it never happened.
[03:03:54.040 --> 03:03:57.104]  There is work to have it, you know, put through.
[03:03:57.465 --> 03:03:59.187]  There absolutely is.
[03:03:59.267 --> 03:03:59.787]  No, I know.
[03:03:59.828 --> 03:04:05.855]  I mean, I know there's groups working for that, but I mean, my issue is the criminals are so consolidated, we've got to work at every level.
[03:04:05.895 --> 03:04:07.037]  That is the problem, though.
[03:04:07.317 --> 03:04:09.419]  The criminals basically can get away with anything.
[03:04:09.740 --> 03:04:10.981]  We're becoming North Korea.
[03:04:11.442 --> 03:04:13.904]  They're putting forward this guy who's extremely anti-banker.
[03:04:13.924 --> 03:04:18.707]  This, you know, comedian is now front-running to be the president of the country and he's taking on the banks.
[03:04:19.108 --> 03:04:27.234]  Now, I believe that if he does become any more successful in Italy, they're going to call up the John Perkins clone, Confessions of an Economic Hitman.
[03:04:27.554 --> 03:04:30.136]  They're going to go down there and they're going to give an ultimatum.
[03:04:30.256 --> 03:04:33.719]  Either you adopt the IMF or you're going to fall out of an airplane.
[03:04:35.097 --> 03:04:36.738]  That's right, absolutely.
[03:04:37.859 --> 03:04:39.821]  They're really scared of what's happening in Italy.
[03:04:39.861 --> 03:04:41.682]  Let me talk to you when we go to break here, Max.
[03:04:42.102 --> 03:04:43.623]  Max Keiser at MaxKeiser.com.

[03:05:03.058 --> 03:05:13.492]  Myself, my family, the Infowars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[03:05:13.732 --> 03:05:17.818]  Infowars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.
[03:05:18.158 --> 03:05:20.579]  But we can't do that without your help.

[03:05:35.685 --> 03:05:41.267]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[03:05:41.807 --> 03:05:51.245]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
