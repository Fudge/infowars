[00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:15.293]  Who controls the past, controls the future.
[00:00:15.754 --> 00:00:18.495]  Who controls the present, controls the past.
[00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:24.601]  Betha Bin Laden marks the most significant achievement to date in our nation's effort to defeat Al Qaeda.
[00:00:24.962 --> 00:00:27.002]  All you gotta do is start looking around.
[00:00:27.383 --> 00:00:28.983]  Start thinking for yourself.
[00:00:29.263 --> 00:00:30.684]  Start investigating things.
[00:00:31.244 --> 00:00:35.286]  And you will see it all right there.
[00:00:35.326 --> 00:00:36.747]  So you have the power.
[00:00:37.087 --> 00:00:38.627]  Humanity has the power.
[00:00:39.088 --> 00:00:40.188]  We have the power.
[00:00:40.208 --> 00:00:41.189]  Do you wanna fight?
[00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:43.570]  You better believe you got one!
[00:00:45.891 --> 00:00:48.814]  Let us never tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories.
[00:00:48.874 --> 00:01:00.344]  As for me, give me liberty or give me death!
[00:01:00.404 --> 00:01:01.425]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:01:08.959 --> 00:01:10.644]  Welcome to the Infovoice Nightly News.
[00:01:10.744 --> 00:01:12.008]  I'm your host, Jakari Jackson.
[00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:14.355]  This is what we have in store for you for this March 6, 2013 edition.
[00:01:18.695 --> 00:01:28.958]  Tonight, the establishment media goes into desperate damage control as they circle the wagons and attack Lou Dobbs for stating the obvious.
[00:01:29.238 --> 00:01:39.501]  What in the world is going on as the Homeland Department, Department of Homeland Security seems to be arming up and the administration is trying to disarm American citizens?
[00:01:39.801 --> 00:01:41.161]  Then, can the U.S.
[00:01:41.221 --> 00:01:43.342]  government kill citizens at home?
[00:01:43.702 --> 00:01:47.623]  Eric Holder won't rule out drone strikes on U.S.
[00:01:47.703 --> 00:01:48.123]  soil.
[00:01:48.443 --> 00:01:49.743]  Plus, it's official.
[00:01:50.184 --> 00:01:52.564]  Another communist strongman is dead.
[00:01:52.964 --> 00:01:56.345]  Alex Jones talks about the death of Hugo Chavez.
[00:01:56.865 --> 00:02:00.566]  And then gives us his take on the coming police state in America.
[00:02:00.826 --> 00:02:03.667]  That's up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:02:08.228 --> 00:02:08.929]  And welcome back.
[00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:12.091]  Top story headline, Hugo Chavez is dead.
[00:02:12.151 --> 00:02:13.652]  I'm sure many of you know by now.
[00:02:13.992 --> 00:02:20.938]  And Alex Jones, who was supposed to be on vacation, just couldn't help himself and decided to make a few videos about the death of Mr. Chavez.
[00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.499]  So let's take a look at some of those reports.
[00:02:25.325 --> 00:02:33.447]  Earlier today, I followed a report minutes after it was announced that the leader of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, lost his battle with cancer.
[00:02:33.467 --> 00:02:42.550]  And I pointed out that there are far worse communists and socialists in the world, but still, what he set up in Venezuela replaced one tyranny with another.
[00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:50.434]  Now his vice president, his aide-de-camp, has come out and accused the United States of the globalists that run it.
[00:02:50.914 --> 00:02:51.914]  Notice he never does that.
[00:02:51.974 --> 00:02:57.837]  They always accuse the United States of capitalism, not the crony, insider, globalist mafia.
[00:02:58.417 --> 00:03:03.480]  No, no, communists never accuse the real heart of tyranny because half the time they're being financed by the same group.
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.901]  In fact, more than half the time.
[00:03:05.281 --> 00:03:09.683]  But he came out and said the West killed Chavez with cancer.
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.381]  Now you cannot call him a conspiracy theorist over that.
[00:03:13.921 --> 00:03:30.668]  And in fact I'm going to file this video that I'm going to have Paul Watson in the morning write a blurb adding links under it at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com documenting the fact that there's been a weaponized cancer program by the Soviet Union in Russia back in the 70s, 80s and 90s.
[00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:39.331]  Early 90s and that there has been a long-term weaponized cancer program here in the United States and in Europe.
[00:03:39.711 --> 00:03:49.853]  And it's on record that the polio vaccine had SV40 cancer virus in it that infected hundreds of millions of Americans and gave tens of millions of them terminal cancer.
[00:03:49.893 --> 00:03:52.454]  Just look up SV40 polio vaccine.
[00:03:52.494 --> 00:03:54.154]  This is the government admitting it.
[00:03:54.614 --> 00:03:57.797]  They know that aspartame has increased type 2 diabetes.
[00:03:58.098 --> 00:03:58.998]  That's now being admitted.
[00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:02.282]  They know that bisphenol A feminizes men and lowers fertility.
[00:04:02.522 --> 00:04:05.465]  They know that tetanus shot with pregnant women kills their babies.
[00:04:05.785 --> 00:04:07.427]  They know all this and they're doing it.
[00:04:07.827 --> 00:04:10.490]  So, regardless of whether or not they killed Chavez,
[00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.933]  with a cancer virus, a fast-acting one or not, that he survived a few years.
[00:04:15.594 --> 00:04:28.304]  Regardless of whether that's true or not, you have to say it has to be looked at because this program exists and we know that the American people, the people of the world in general, are being targeted by these weapons systems.
[00:04:29.185 --> 00:04:51.153]  The sodium fluoride, the hydrofluorosilicic acid that's added to your water, Harvard study, lowered IQ, cancer, brain damage, off the charts, bisphenol A, aspartame, MSG, and hundreds of other chemicals, fire retardants they put in Gatorade, human fetal cells being used to grow the quote flavoring in Pepsi, and dozens of their other products.
[00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:54.027]  I'm just scratching the tip of the iceberg.
[00:04:54.067 --> 00:05:03.073]  The runoff of our sewage is so toxic with the Prozac drugs and things that the shrimp and frogs and fish are committing suicide.
[00:05:03.293 --> 00:05:03.774]  Look it up.
[00:05:04.234 --> 00:05:07.537]  Truth is a thousand times stranger than fiction.
[00:05:07.997 --> 00:05:13.962]  And so we're all being hit by eugenics-based cancer weapons to reduce population.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.001]  And I was on Howard Stern's show last week and he said, well there are too many of us.
[00:05:18.021 --> 00:05:19.841]  And I said, Howard, you're being targeted.
[00:05:20.061 --> 00:05:21.042]  Did you get a memo?
[00:05:21.282 --> 00:05:22.402]  Did the public get a memo?
[00:05:22.882 --> 00:05:24.683]  Are you going to commit suicide because there's so many people?
[00:05:24.703 --> 00:05:25.943]  And he goes, well, you've got a point.
[00:05:27.463 --> 00:05:29.224]  Folks, they're targeting all of us.
[00:05:29.264 --> 00:05:31.745]  Less than one-tenth of one percent is even in on this.
[00:05:32.625 --> 00:05:34.645]  But they've sold the public on there's too many of us.
[00:05:34.905 --> 00:05:36.346]  The point is they're killing us.
[00:05:37.657 --> 00:05:48.701]  They're using these binary weapons on us and so we need to take this information concerning Chavez and expand it out to the general public so people understand, hey, I don't know if they killed him.
[00:05:48.721 --> 00:05:58.645]  A whole bunch of those South American leaders that get cross eyes with the globalists are dying because they've taken over with their own form of tyranny and the globalists want a monopoly of control.
[00:05:59.705 --> 00:06:01.506]  But I do know we're being targeted.
[00:06:01.526 --> 00:06:02.987]  The whole world's being targeted.
[00:06:03.368 --> 00:06:05.609]  I mean, just look up Bill Gates in India last year.
[00:06:05.649 --> 00:06:09.692]  Forty-something thousand kids ended up getting polio from the polio vaccine.
[00:06:09.752 --> 00:06:10.373]  I mean, come on.
[00:06:10.553 --> 00:06:13.615]  They're doing this in plain view, but acting like it's no big deal.
[00:06:13.996 --> 00:06:16.157]  One man dies, it's a huge tragedy.
[00:06:16.197 --> 00:06:17.658]  Ten thousand die, it's a statistic.
[00:06:17.898 --> 00:06:18.919]  And the globalists know that.
[00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:22.021]  Alex Jones signing off for InfoWars.com.
[00:06:22.041 --> 00:06:22.942]  Do they kill Chavez?
[00:06:23.242 --> 00:06:23.643]  I don't know.
[00:06:23.923 --> 00:06:24.703]  Are they killing us?
[00:06:24.984 --> 00:06:25.484]  Hell yes.
[00:06:25.764 --> 00:06:26.745]  InfoWars.com.
[00:06:29.019 --> 00:06:33.764]  All right, so great report by Alex, but I definitely hope he actually has somewhat of a vacation.
[00:06:33.804 --> 00:06:35.066]  We'll move on to our next story.
[00:06:35.666 --> 00:06:39.611]  Email tells Feds to make sequester as painful as possible.
[00:06:39.651 --> 00:06:40.432]  Let's take a look at this.
[00:06:40.872 --> 00:06:48.961]  The White House announced Tuesday that it is canceling tours of the President's home for the foreseeable future because of sequestration.
[00:06:49.362 --> 00:06:50.363]  Now, I want to point out
[00:06:50.843 --> 00:06:57.791]  They're cutting people who actually work in the White House, but meanwhile, Barack Obama and his family can take $7 million vacations.
[00:06:57.831 --> 00:06:59.653]  I just wanted to throw that out there.
[00:06:59.974 --> 00:07:01.115]  But we'll get back into the article.
[00:07:01.595 --> 00:07:07.783]  In an internal email, Animal and Planet Health Inspection Services official Charles Brown said this.
[00:07:08.443 --> 00:07:18.469]  It is our opinion that however you manage that reduction, you need to make sure that you are not contradicting what we said the impact would be, Mr. Brown said in an email.
[00:07:18.789 --> 00:07:22.171]  And you can read the full email for yourself as well as the comments afterward.
[00:07:23.792 --> 00:07:32.317]  They're basically trying to hype it up to make it seem as bad as possible, just like Jan Napolitano saying, you know, there can be new terror attacks if we cut budget cuts.
[00:07:32.758 --> 00:07:34.719]  If we have budget cuts, we have sequestration.
[00:07:35.039 --> 00:07:40.323]  So people, they just don't want to give up anything, and $85 billion in the U.S.
[00:07:40.383 --> 00:07:41.663]  is not a whole lot of money.
[00:07:41.683 --> 00:07:48.508]  I know it sounds like a lot, but just think how much we spend each year on a war, and that's, you know, that's a big amount of money.
[00:07:48.888 --> 00:07:50.009]  So we'll move on to our next story.
[00:07:50.751 --> 00:07:54.413]  Yes, your government can use armed drones against you.
[00:07:55.054 --> 00:07:57.635]  At least now they admit it, because first they didn't even want to do that.
[00:07:58.236 --> 00:08:06.921]  So we have a letter here from Attorney General Eric Holder to Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, and Mr. Holder had this to say.
[00:08:07.882 --> 00:08:27.791]  It is possible, I suppose, to imagine an extraordinary circumstance in which it would be necessary, he says necessary, and appropriate under the Constitution and applicable laws of the United States for the President to authorize the military to use lethal force within the territory of the United States, and that's referring to a drone strike.
[00:08:28.391 --> 00:08:34.114]  So at least now they have to admit that they have drone strikes or they were thinking about it.
[00:08:34.434 --> 00:08:36.755]  And to anybody who would say, well what's the difference?
[00:08:36.835 --> 00:08:38.696]  The military has guns, police have guns.
[00:08:39.016 --> 00:08:45.859]  I believe it was last week I talked about how the police, even though they have guns, no human gun is above human error.
[00:08:46.219 --> 00:08:54.903]  Case in point, the Chris Dorner incident where the police were opening fire on people in vehicles who did not vaguely match the description of Chris Dorner.
[00:08:55.023 --> 00:08:55.283]  That's
[00:08:55.923 --> 00:08:57.064]  That's where the issue is.
[00:08:57.405 --> 00:08:58.646]  I think drones have a purpose.
[00:08:58.666 --> 00:08:59.887]  You know, it's advanced technology.
[00:08:59.947 --> 00:09:01.809]  I'm not, you know, anti-technology.
[00:09:01.849 --> 00:09:07.074]  They can be used for search and rescue missions and fighting forest fires, things such as that.
[00:09:07.195 --> 00:09:16.444]  I'm just not ready to arm these things because they can't even hit their targets in Pakistan, where the Pakistan Interior Minister said 80% of the targets of these drone strikes are non-combatants.
[00:09:16.504 --> 00:09:18.085]  That's my issue with it.
[00:09:18.826 --> 00:09:23.030]  Media portrays DHS ammo purchase as conspiracy theory.
[00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:25.572]  Now, we've well documented the bullet bias.
[00:09:25.632 --> 00:09:28.454]  I'm not going to go too in-depth on that, but I just wanted to point this out.
[00:09:28.894 --> 00:09:39.923]  The latest examples include Media Matters and Raw Story, both of which attacked Fox Business host Lou Dobbs for daring to raise the issue on his March 4th broadcast.
[00:09:40.544 --> 00:09:41.565]  And it goes on to say,
[00:09:42.145 --> 00:09:52.654]  Hijacking confusion about whether over 200, excuse me, over 2,000, don't want to exaggerate, over 2,000 armored vehicles were destined for DHS or the United States Marine Corps.
[00:09:52.994 --> 00:10:05.285]  Media Matters, which has been documented to be little more than an Obama administration mouthpiece, reported that, quote, the claim that DHS bought a 1.6 billion bullet stockpile is also misleading.
[00:10:05.905 --> 00:10:12.588]  End quote, while simultaneously admitting that DHS did buy 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition.
[00:10:13.008 --> 00:10:17.951]  So, it's misleading to say that they bought that many, but they actually did.
[00:10:18.411 --> 00:10:23.653]  But, in terms of the trucks, we actually have a video of these trucks, so you can see for themselves.
[00:10:23.933 --> 00:10:27.515]  I'm not saying Marines don't have these big armored trucks, which you see right there on your screen.
[00:10:28.035 --> 00:10:29.796]  Nowhere on that vehicle does it say U.S.
[00:10:29.816 --> 00:10:30.196]  Marines.
[00:10:30.656 --> 00:10:31.237]  We'll keep watching.
[00:10:31.297 --> 00:10:34.038]  Homeland Security, police and police rescue.
[00:10:34.748 --> 00:10:36.508]  Okay, Homeland Security, police, rescue.
[00:10:36.548 --> 00:10:40.369]  The guy has police written on his jacket there, police on his helmet.
[00:10:40.709 --> 00:10:43.490]  This guy is dressed up in Homeland Security outfits.
[00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:46.250]  You see police in the background, police on the truck.
[00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:51.291]  Homeland Security, Homeland Security, police, police, Homeland Security, and more police.
[00:10:51.571 --> 00:10:54.532]  And they say they need that for warrant enforcement.
[00:10:54.892 --> 00:11:03.334]  They need a bomb-proof, I mean a mine-proof truck for warrant enforcement because we know the Crips and Bloods have a stockpile of mines.
[00:11:04.034 --> 00:11:07.416]  So, yes, they do have those for DHS.
[00:11:07.696 --> 00:11:08.076]  There you go.
[00:11:08.336 --> 00:11:08.556]  Proof.
[00:11:09.357 --> 00:11:10.577]  And our last story of the night.
[00:11:10.977 --> 00:11:13.739]  City looks to make gun ownership mandatory.
[00:11:13.759 --> 00:11:16.480]  Okay, let's see what they have to say.
[00:11:17.791 --> 00:11:21.233]  One police officer patrols Nelson, Georgia for eight hours during the day.
[00:11:21.593 --> 00:11:26.757]  That leaves 16 hours overnight when the city is basically unguarded, a very reasonable concern.
[00:11:27.357 --> 00:11:32.300]  The Nelson ordinance is modeled closely after the 1982 law passed in Kennesaw.
[00:11:33.001 --> 00:11:36.263]  It requires gun ownership, but also allows several outs.
[00:11:37.256 --> 00:11:43.362]  Like if you're physically or mentally unable to handle a gun, or if you're a felon or have religious objections.
[00:11:44.023 --> 00:11:49.409]  Now, I know many of our critics out there would say, well, you don't want the government telling you what to do and this and that.
[00:11:49.429 --> 00:11:51.211]  You don't want the government forcing you to buy a product.
[00:11:51.751 --> 00:11:53.012]  Okay, I agree with you.
[00:11:53.032 --> 00:11:54.454]  I agree with that statement.
[00:11:54.794 --> 00:11:58.977]  I don't want anybody to own a gun who just flat-out does not want to have a gun.
[00:11:59.258 --> 00:12:00.258]  It doesn't have to be religious.
[00:12:00.278 --> 00:12:02.140]  You don't have to be a felon, ex-con.
[00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:05.482]  If you just say, hey, I don't want guns in my house, that is your business.
[00:12:05.923 --> 00:12:09.585]  So, good try to Nelson.
[00:12:09.605 --> 00:12:15.950]  The only thing I would say is I would suggest that you have an opt-out program where if you just don't want to have a gun, you don't have to have a gun.
[00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:17.291]  That's the only thing I would say about that.
[00:12:18.792 --> 00:12:22.114]  Before we end our broadcast, I do have this clip of Ron Paul.
[00:12:22.454 --> 00:12:25.376]  This is some classic Ron Paul standing up for your Second Amendment.
[00:12:25.436 --> 00:12:26.357]  It's nothing new to him.
[00:12:26.757 --> 00:12:27.477]  Ron Paul back in 1989.
[00:12:30.236 --> 00:12:37.120]  This gun sure looks deadly, but it's not the least bit deadly unless I point it at someone and pull the trigger.
[00:12:37.921 --> 00:12:42.904]  I think it's important that we look at the Second Amendment in context of the entire Bill of Rights.
[00:12:43.385 --> 00:12:49.428]  That means we have a right to own anything we want, including guns, as long as we harm no other person.
[00:12:50.209 --> 00:12:56.193]  If we sacrifice our liberty in the pursuit of safety, we'll lose our safety and our liberty.
[00:12:57.657 --> 00:12:59.359]  All right, great job, Ron Paul.
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:01.082]  He looked like Rand back there.
[00:13:01.102 --> 00:13:02.684]  Almost didn't recognize him.
[00:13:03.004 --> 00:13:04.947]  Anyway, we'll move on to our quote of the day.
[00:13:05.267 --> 00:13:06.709]  This is from Mr. Bill Gates.
[00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:10.134]  The world today has 6.8 billion people.
[00:13:10.534 --> 00:13:11.836]  That's headed up to about 9 billion.
[00:13:12.617 --> 00:13:21.864]  Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, healthcare, reproductive health services, we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent.
[00:13:22.344 --> 00:13:30.850]  Now, whenever people say the world is overpopulated, I'm just wondering why they're living, breathing, telling me this fact, because they're still on the world.
[00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:33.472]  If you cared so much about the globe, wouldn't you kill yourself?
[00:13:33.492 --> 00:13:41.218]  Now, I'm not advocating suicide, but saying the world's overpopulated, you got yourself, you got your wife, you got your kids, and all of them are still alive and happy, so I just don't understand.
[00:13:42.478 --> 00:13:47.160]  It's like complaining that people drive slow and you're driving 25 miles an hour in the fast lane.
[00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:48.380]  It just doesn't make sense to me.
[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:52.821]  But anyway, after this break we'll be right back with Lloyd Chapman, my interview with him.
[00:13:53.882 --> 00:13:55.382]  Very interesting, very in-depth.
[00:13:55.562 --> 00:14:02.744]  And after that, we will have another special report from Mr. Alex Jones, who is clearly not on vacation at all, it seems.
[00:14:03.064 --> 00:14:05.525]  And he's going to be talking about the, not just coming, but the current
[00:14:05.865 --> 00:14:06.446]  Police state.
[00:14:06.786 --> 00:14:11.290]  But before we get to all that, definitely want to encourage you to go to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:13.511]  Get yourself a 15-day free trial.
[00:14:13.812 --> 00:14:17.795]  You can see we have the Alex Jones Radio Show, the Nightly News, the Special Reports, the Rants.
[00:14:17.835 --> 00:14:20.157]  The Rants section is a whole lot better.
[00:14:20.177 --> 00:14:24.701]  It was still for a long time, but John Bowne and myself have been working on that personally to get that up to speed.
[00:14:24.961 --> 00:14:27.503]  So definitely go there and check out the Yosemite Sam Ramp.
[00:14:27.883 --> 00:14:34.929]  And also don't forget, I guess you have a little over a month left for Operation Paul Revere, a contest I very wish I could be in.
[00:14:35.269 --> 00:14:38.072]  I asked Alex if I could take some time off and make a movie and come back.
[00:14:38.112 --> 00:14:39.473]  He's like, no, that's not happening.
[00:14:39.874 --> 00:14:46.100]  But anyway, if you want a total of $115,000 in prizes, check that out.
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.381]  Operation Paul Revere.
[00:14:47.721 --> 00:14:49.503]  You have over a month left.
[00:14:49.823 --> 00:14:51.005]  So definitely, there you go.
[00:14:51.045 --> 00:14:51.825]  Your prize is right there.
[00:14:51.865 --> 00:14:52.466]  Grand Prize, $100,000.
[00:14:55.208 --> 00:14:55.808]  Who does that?
[00:14:55.848 --> 00:15:03.691]  You give your money to some of these other news organizations and they go buy themselves a yacht or go buy their wives new Gucci purses.
[00:15:03.731 --> 00:15:06.192]  We're giving it right back to you, our viewerships.
[00:15:06.532 --> 00:15:08.053]  So we do definitely appreciate you.
[00:15:08.073 --> 00:15:10.434]  So stay tuned right after this break for Lloyd Chapman.
[00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:17.773]  Jakari Jackson here, and I want to talk to you for a second about water.
[00:15:18.414 --> 00:15:25.802]  You know about Pro-Pure, our flagship water purification system, but check out some of our portable water filter products at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:15:26.382 --> 00:15:28.064]  The Clearly Filtered Water Pitcher.
[00:15:28.825 --> 00:15:32.889]  Also, for those of you on the go, we have the Athlete Edition Filtered Water Bottle.
[00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:34.911]  And the R.A.D.
[00:15:34.992 --> 00:15:38.235]  Eliminator Pro-Filtered Sports Bottle that removes radiation.
[00:15:38.715 --> 00:15:41.658]  And keep in mind we have replacement filters for all of these products.
[00:15:42.279 --> 00:15:45.302]  The ever-popular grab-and-go bag favorite, the LifeStraw.
[00:15:45.903 --> 00:15:47.965]  The Crystal Quest Shower Filter System.
[00:15:49.106 --> 00:15:52.009]  And the Aquapod Kit, great for mass storage of water.
[00:15:53.547 --> 00:15:58.432]  And while you're at the InfoWars shop, pick up a copy of our latest book, 31 Days to Survival.
[00:15:59.032 --> 00:16:04.717]  You can find all this and more at the InfoWarsStore.com, and don't forget it's your support that funds our operation.
[00:16:05.158 --> 00:16:09.262]  Sign up for our free newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[00:16:14.304 --> 00:16:22.771]  One of the best ways to promote the Liberty Message is not only by listening to Alex's show, but also by wearing shirts that promote the message.
[00:16:23.071 --> 00:16:26.855]  And as you can see right here on InfoWarshop.com, we have this shirt right here.
[00:16:27.175 --> 00:16:30.117]  It says, Tyrant, and it also has a message in the back.
[00:16:30.538 --> 00:16:31.579]  It says, Come and Take It.
[00:16:32.608 --> 00:16:33.909]  Here's another great t-shirt.
[00:16:34.389 --> 00:16:35.430]  Come and take it.
[00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:41.655]  We obviously know that the Second Amendment is under attack, and this is a great, subtle way to let the public know how you feel.
[00:16:42.215 --> 00:16:44.397]  We also have some great ladies' shirts.
[00:16:44.717 --> 00:16:45.858]  You can see them right now.
[00:16:46.178 --> 00:16:48.179]  This one says InfoWars.com.
[00:16:48.199 --> 00:16:49.981]  There's a lot of female fans of the show.
[00:16:50.401 --> 00:16:54.204]  And we also have a female shirt that promotes the Second Amendment.
[00:16:54.664 --> 00:16:59.508]  Contrary to what some people might think, there are many females that love themselves some guns.
[00:17:00.598 --> 00:17:02.840]  And this is another great shirt that you can get.
[00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:06.283]  It's a camouflage shirt with Infowars.com written across.
[00:17:07.244 --> 00:17:08.364]  And now you have a choice.
[00:17:08.645 --> 00:17:12.228]  Do you want to end the TSA or end the Fed?
[00:17:13.288 --> 00:17:20.376]  We also have this great army style t-shirt and this shirt as well as many others are available at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:17:20.976 --> 00:17:24.720]  And last but not least, may the truth be with you.
[00:17:25.441 --> 00:17:27.743]  Obviously a reference to the Star Wars film.
[00:17:28.384 --> 00:17:30.827]  All these shirts are available at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:17:32.308 --> 00:17:36.310]  InfoWars Magazine is more than just our answer to the internet kill switch.
[00:17:36.991 --> 00:17:50.878]  We're also going back to the roots of this country, when our founders, for a decade before 1776, known as the Pamploteers, with hundreds of little printing presses in every colony, got out the real news, the real information, and countered the system.
[00:17:51.198 --> 00:17:56.021]  This is tailored design, with the truth, to wake up your friends and family.
[00:17:56.281 --> 00:17:59.323]  This is the 21st century version of the Pamploteers.

[00:18:16.568 --> 00:18:21.550]  Whatever you do, be part of the fight and I want to salute and thank all of you.
[00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:22.310]  We're good to go.
[00:18:42.259 --> 00:18:42.920]  And welcome back.
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:44.801]  Our guest tonight is Lloyd Chapman.
[00:18:45.101 --> 00:18:47.223]  He's the president of the American Small Business League.
[00:18:47.503 --> 00:18:50.045]  He's with us to discuss sequestration and many other topics.
[00:18:50.285 --> 00:18:51.446]  He joins us now via Skype.
[00:18:51.746 --> 00:18:52.647]  Thanks for joining us, Lloyd.
[00:18:53.493 --> 00:18:54.213]  Thanks for having me.
[00:18:54.773 --> 00:18:57.654]  Alright, now I wanted to start with an article that you put out not too long ago.
[00:18:57.674 --> 00:19:02.816]  Headline, government sequestration cuts pale in comparison to rampant fiscal abuse.
[00:19:03.376 --> 00:19:05.197]  I'll just read a little bit of it for our viewers here.
[00:19:05.657 --> 00:19:14.140]  The President, Congress and the media are all trying to convince us that the 85 billion annual sequestration budget cuts will cripple our government.
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:24.764]  You go on to say, on the day before 9-11, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld announced that $2.3 trillion, with a T, in Pentagon spending cannot be accounted for.
[00:19:24.804 --> 00:19:28.525]  The amount of money that's unaccounted would make it possible for the U.S.
[00:19:28.565 --> 00:19:33.467]  to avoid the $85 billion in annual budget cuts for the next 27 years.
[00:19:33.907 --> 00:19:40.069]  Now, Mr. Chapman, if you could just go point by point, whatever you want to bring up in the article, tell us what the significance of this article is.
[00:19:41.055 --> 00:19:48.038]  Well, you know, in the last few days, the Obama administration has canceled tours of the White House.
[00:19:48.798 --> 00:19:49.999]  They've grounded the Blue Angels.
[00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:55.901]  They're laying off TSA workers and teachers at military bases around the country.
[00:19:56.882 --> 00:20:03.925]  They're letting people out of prison, home insecurity, because of budget considerations.
[00:20:04.365 --> 00:20:06.926]  And the truth is, you know, this $85 billion cut
[00:20:10.219 --> 00:20:10.939]  That's peanuts.
[00:20:10.959 --> 00:20:12.740]  The Pentagon loses that much money a month.
[00:20:14.241 --> 00:20:16.122]  And it's just absurd.
[00:20:16.802 --> 00:20:28.767]  In fact, with the sequestration cuts, the federal government will have the same amount of money they had last year to spend, even though the amount of money we spend in Iraq and Afghanistan has dropped dramatically as we wind down those wars.
[00:20:28.847 --> 00:20:32.969]  So it's just absurd to think about
[00:20:33.806 --> 00:20:38.889]  You know, President Obama basically, you know, trying to panic the American people, telling them all these horrible things can happen.
[00:20:38.909 --> 00:20:40.970]  We have to cut this $85 billion.
[00:20:41.371 --> 00:20:43.852]  In reality, trillions are missing.
[00:20:44.312 --> 00:20:44.793]  Trillions.
[00:20:45.487 --> 00:20:53.874]  Exactly, and we've heard people like, not to cut you off, but we've heard people like Janet Napolitano saying, an attack is going to happen, we have to be on alert if we cut this money.
[00:20:54.555 --> 00:21:01.180]  Just like you said, they've cut White House tours, even though the Obama family themselves are going to have a $7 million vacation.
[00:21:01.721 --> 00:21:07.966]  You know, if we want budget, if we have to cut one or the other, have tours, why don't we cut somebody's security detail?
[00:21:08.607 --> 00:21:09.188]  Absolutely.
[00:21:09.468 --> 00:21:18.656]  In fact, just today it was on television that John Kerry, the Obama administration, gave Egypt $250 million.
[00:21:18.936 --> 00:21:24.661]  And since Obama was elected, foreign aid has doubled.
[00:21:25.512 --> 00:21:31.798]  So from last year to this year, Obama pumped up the foreign aid budget by $9 billion.
[00:21:31.858 --> 00:21:35.822]  That's over 10% of what we need to cut for the since sequestration.
[00:21:36.303 --> 00:21:38.105]  So it just doesn't make any sense.
[00:21:38.145 --> 00:21:39.286]  There's no logic to it.
[00:21:39.346 --> 00:21:40.867]  And it's just not true.
[00:21:40.947 --> 00:21:41.488]  It's a lie.
[00:21:41.608 --> 00:21:42.969]  It's just simply not true.
[00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:46.433]  If your income or my income went down 2.4%, we wouldn't even notice it.
[00:21:49.796 --> 00:21:55.804]  It's not like you can sell your house and move in with one of your friends, or sell your car and ride the bus to work.
[00:21:55.824 --> 00:21:56.645]  You wouldn't even notice it.
[00:21:57.366 --> 00:22:04.696]  But the truth is that the federal government wastes and loses $85 billion a month
[00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:17.672]  Um, and there's just no, it's just absurd for, you know, to think about cutting, you know, government services with this, you know, sequestration thing.
[00:22:17.692 --> 00:22:19.492]  It's just, it's just baloney.
[00:22:19.612 --> 00:22:34.415]  It's just completely ridiculous, especially when you take into account they're buying billions of bullets, they have new armored tanks, they're buying AR-15s fully automatic, they're buying all these uniforms for the TSA, and David Knight brought up a good point.
[00:22:34.775 --> 00:22:35.155]  He said,
[00:22:35.615 --> 00:22:44.079]  I can't remember the exact figure it was for each employee, but he said they're either going to take that money and spend it for something else, or they're going to hire a whole bunch more TSA personnel.
[00:22:44.439 --> 00:22:44.979]  Absolutely.
[00:22:45.719 --> 00:22:47.200]  Yeah, it's just ridiculous.
[00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:53.163]  So, I'd like your viewers and listeners to go to YouTube.
[00:22:54.316 --> 00:22:56.718]  And take a look at the hearing.
[00:22:57.479 --> 00:23:01.943]  I think the title of the video is something like 9 trillion missing from the Federal Reserve.
[00:23:02.524 --> 00:23:06.407]  And watch Alan Grayson question the Inspector General for the Federal Reserve.
[00:23:07.088 --> 00:23:12.472]  And he asked her if she knows who received this 9 trillion.
[00:23:12.492 --> 00:23:13.373]  9 trillion!
[00:23:14.134 --> 00:23:14.895]  And she says no.
[00:23:15.695 --> 00:23:16.056]  I don't know.
[00:23:17.512 --> 00:23:18.113]  It's amazing.
[00:23:18.153 --> 00:23:18.873]  You've got to watch that.
[00:23:18.893 --> 00:23:22.736]  You've got to see that, because you can't believe it until you see it with your own eyes, right?
[00:23:23.196 --> 00:23:23.537]  Right.
[00:23:23.617 --> 00:23:42.891]  People should go to your computer and Google Federal Reserve Audit, you know, GAO Federal Reserve Audit, and read about the $16 trillion in near zero interest loans the Federal Reserve made without talking to the President or Congress or anybody, to banks and businesses and governments all around the world.
[00:23:43.051 --> 00:23:43.772]  It's insane.
[00:23:44.352 --> 00:23:46.754]  It really is, and our viewers can see it right there on the screen.
[00:23:47.846 --> 00:23:49.267]  Yeah, it's just insane.
[00:23:49.827 --> 00:23:51.528]  It's like this isn't a democracy anymore.
[00:23:52.608 --> 00:23:55.870]  And the government does whatever they want to do, the Federal Reserve does whatever they want to do.
[00:23:55.890 --> 00:23:58.811]  In fact, the Federal Reserve seems to act with complete impunity.
[00:23:59.212 --> 00:24:01.973]  They can do anything they want to do and there's nothing you can do about it.
[00:24:02.553 --> 00:24:14.759]  I mentioned there were large numbers, the only thing that was in the story, of uncirculated $100 bills that went missing in transit to the Federal Reserve.
[00:24:17.464 --> 00:24:18.665]  That story was unreported.
[00:24:19.206 --> 00:24:20.587]  When was that, Mr. Chapman?
[00:24:20.787 --> 00:24:21.408]  When did that happen?
[00:24:21.428 --> 00:24:23.089]  I think that was just a few months ago.
[00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:30.475]  And it's a large, large section, so we don't know how much it was, how many truckloads it could have been.
[00:24:30.535 --> 00:24:31.716]  It just up and disappeared.
[00:24:32.077 --> 00:24:32.317]  Yeah.
[00:24:32.657 --> 00:24:38.982]  In fact, the FBI just called it a large volume of uncirculated, you know, $100 bills.
[00:24:40.404 --> 00:24:41.665]  They don't know how much.
[00:24:42.125 --> 00:24:42.946]  That's what's amazing.
[00:24:43.573 --> 00:24:44.274]  It really is.
[00:24:44.334 --> 00:24:45.975]  I mean, they have... ...doesn't know how much.
[00:24:48.237 --> 00:25:05.592]  I remember looking on the internet about the Federal Reserve and I remember reading a line where the government investigators were looking up at the money that the Federal Reserve sent to Iraq and said the people at the Federal Reserve refused to cooperate.
[00:25:07.733 --> 00:25:09.235]  And then I remember during the
[00:25:10.211 --> 00:25:24.882]  What's the GOP debates and we have people like Herman Cain saying oh we don't we don't need to audit the Fed and you know Ron Paul's you know so we got we got out of the Fed and Herman Cain saying why would we need to audit the Fed if you want to audit the Fed just give them a call and they'll they'll give you whatever you want to know.
[00:25:25.302 --> 00:25:25.902]  Oh yeah.
[00:25:27.504 --> 00:25:27.804]  Oh yeah.
[00:25:27.884 --> 00:25:30.426]  Oh go ahead.
[00:25:30.946 --> 00:25:36.730]  That's absurd you know in my story I talk about
[00:25:38.376 --> 00:25:47.603]  You know, there's a documentary called We're Not Broke that I watched one night, and it talks about the fact that the nation's largest corporations are paying little or no income tax.
[00:25:48.809 --> 00:25:59.992]  So while, you know, people like you and I are paying our fair share of taxes, the largest, most successful corporations in America are paying no taxes, like ExxonMobil and, you know, big corporations.
[00:26:00.012 --> 00:26:02.512]  It's just obscene.
[00:26:02.552 --> 00:26:03.613]  It just drives me crazy.
[00:26:04.253 --> 00:26:08.534]  But people should make themselves aware of this, because you're not going to see this on the nightly news.
[00:26:08.674 --> 00:26:10.174]  I'm not sure why that is exactly.
[00:26:10.655 --> 00:26:14.195]  But it's interesting that these, you know, Sandy Hook is in the news.
[00:26:14.816 --> 00:26:15.896]  It's still in the news every day.
[00:26:17.096 --> 00:26:18.557]  It's on the news today, right?
[00:26:18.877 --> 00:26:19.097]  Right.
[00:26:19.297 --> 00:26:22.879]  So we hear about that, you know, and that was a horrible tragedy, but we hear about that every day.
[00:26:23.699 --> 00:26:28.001]  And yet, when they find 16 trillion in secret loans at the Federal Reserve, they don't mention that.
[00:26:28.502 --> 00:26:29.302]  No, no.
[00:26:30.282 --> 00:26:33.804]  Millions, if not billions of dollars in uncirculated hundred-dollar bills evaporate.
[00:26:34.044 --> 00:26:35.645]  They don't talk about that, you know.
[00:26:36.025 --> 00:26:37.486]  Trillions disappear from the Pentagon.
[00:26:37.526 --> 00:26:38.466]  They don't talk about that.
[00:26:38.546 --> 00:26:42.248]  It's interesting what the mainstream media chooses to talk about.
[00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:46.782]  But I don't think most people even realize the Federal Reserve is not a federal institution.
[00:26:46.882 --> 00:26:49.644]  It's, as you guys know, a privately owned banking cartel.
[00:26:50.304 --> 00:26:50.985]  Exactly right.
[00:26:52.426 --> 00:26:57.289]  The Inspector General for the Federal Reserve found blatant conflicts of interest.
[00:26:58.009 --> 00:27:00.311]  The Geo Investigation found the same thing.
[00:27:00.851 --> 00:27:02.372]  But it's just amazing to me.
[00:27:02.512 --> 00:27:06.955]  It's just incomprehensible that these stories aren't reported.
[00:27:09.423 --> 00:27:16.325]  I think the Obama administration is starting to tone down their rhetoric about this, you know, the sky is falling bologna with the cis-crustacean cuts.
[00:27:19.826 --> 00:27:23.628]  It's just, you know... Well, let me ask you this, Mr. Chapman.
[00:27:24.028 --> 00:27:26.629]  Is there any amount of money you think would actually make a difference?
[00:27:26.649 --> 00:27:28.549]  Could we see this $85 billion number?
[00:27:28.849 --> 00:27:33.631]  Is there any particular number or any area you think funds could be taken out of?
[00:27:35.194 --> 00:27:48.659]  Well, Josh, if you're legitimately trying to cut the federal budget, I imagine there's probably $850 billion you could cut, not $85 billion.
[00:27:48.679 --> 00:27:50.119]  $85 billion is nothing.
[00:27:50.539 --> 00:27:52.320]  They should be cutting probably about $200 billion.
[00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:53.160]  A year?
[00:27:53.741 --> 00:27:53.981]  Yeah.
[00:27:54.241 --> 00:27:55.561]  Okay.
[00:27:56.582 --> 00:28:00.143]  But the federal budget, by the way, has doubled, I think, in the last 10 years, something like that.
[00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:16.450]  But I think that if they just ended the fraud and if they look at the inspector generals for each federal agency and look at the amount of money that they're losing and just stop that.
[00:28:18.691 --> 00:28:21.653]  But there's certainly lots of places to cut the federal budget.
[00:28:21.673 --> 00:28:23.754]  I remember watching TV the other night and
[00:28:25.407 --> 00:28:32.749]  The Pentagon was spending millions of dollars studying fish to see if we could learn something about democracy by studying fish.
[00:28:33.649 --> 00:28:34.430]  What?
[00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:35.550]  Can you repeat that, Mr. Chairman?
[00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:38.291]  You said they're trying to learn democracy from fish.
[00:28:38.711 --> 00:28:43.092]  Yes, they were studying the behavior of fish to see what we can learn about democracy.
[00:28:43.392 --> 00:28:46.033]  They were studying babies' reactions to robots.
[00:28:46.773 --> 00:28:50.094]  I think that was on CNN the other night.
[00:28:50.114 --> 00:28:51.455]  Either Fox or CNN, you know?
[00:28:54.318 --> 00:28:55.799]  I have a friend that was in the Air Force.
[00:28:55.819 --> 00:29:02.442]  He said every room in an Air Force base has a 60-inch flat screen monitor, you know?
[00:29:02.702 --> 00:29:04.043]  Wow.
[00:29:04.063 --> 00:29:07.945]  I know that the government buys brand new computers every year from Dell, primarily.
[00:29:08.723 --> 00:29:15.565]  Well, we have an article on our screen right now that says the Pentagon is wasting their money on beef, jerky, balloons, bird studies.
[00:29:16.205 --> 00:29:17.665]  Beef, jerky, and balloons?
[00:29:18.106 --> 00:29:21.386]  Yeah.
[00:29:21.987 --> 00:29:27.568]  I think it was a barbecue specialist on the payroll, something like that, you know?
[00:29:27.708 --> 00:29:29.949]  Wow, that's too bizarre.
[00:29:29.989 --> 00:29:32.049]  Now, Mr. Chairman, I want to move on to some other topics.
[00:29:32.529 --> 00:29:37.851]  Speaking of the small businesses, how have you seen small businesses be affected by Obamacare?
[00:29:38.531 --> 00:29:40.253]  Or what do you think is going to happen in the near future?
[00:29:41.193 --> 00:29:43.075]  Well, I think it's going to be a negative.
[00:29:44.356 --> 00:29:46.358]  And I don't think Obama cares anything about small business.
[00:29:46.378 --> 00:29:47.358]  In fact, I know he doesn't.
[00:29:47.378 --> 00:29:50.020]  There's no question he doesn't care about small businesses.
[00:29:50.781 --> 00:30:00.229]  The American Small Business League is going to put out a list of the top 100 recipients of small business contracts in a few days, and about 72 are large businesses, including Lockheed Martin.
[00:30:01.345 --> 00:30:10.168]  So, you know, in February of 2008, Barack Obama released a press release that ended with the phrase, it's time to end the diversion of federal small business contracts to corporate giants.
[00:30:10.868 --> 00:30:20.132]  And the reality is that the volume of federal contracts, of federal small business contracts to large corporations has gone up during his administration.
[00:30:21.172 --> 00:30:26.954]  But yeah, small businesses are going to be hurt by Obamacare, and small businesses are struggling.
[00:30:26.974 --> 00:30:43.140]  In fact, there was an article, I think on the front page of LA Times today, about how small businesses are struggling, and the stock market's doing great, and Fortune 500s are doing great, but small businesses are still struggling, and people need to realize that small businesses create between 90% and 100% of all the net new jobs in America.
[00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:54.147]  So that's one reason why the stock market's doing great, but we still have really high unemployment because small businesses create the net new jobs in America, and they haven't gotten anything from Obama.
[00:30:54.167 --> 00:31:04.654]  They've gotten nothing from the stimulus, and even the programs that were in place, like the Small Business Act that requires 23% of all government contracts to go to small businesses, that's being diverted to large corporations.
[00:31:05.495 --> 00:31:10.881]  You know, Obama wants to close the SBA, the only agency in Washington to help the 28 million small businesses where most Americans work.
[00:31:11.662 --> 00:31:13.704]  I would characterize Obama as anti-small business.
[00:31:14.265 --> 00:31:14.685]  Exactly.
[00:31:14.946 --> 00:31:20.712]  Now, Mr. Chapman, we spent so much time ranting and raving about White House stories, we've come to the end of our interview.
[00:31:20.992 --> 00:31:23.876]  But any closing comments you'd like to make, Mr. Lloyd Chapman?
[00:31:24.436 --> 00:31:25.818]  I think people should go to the Internet.
[00:31:26.716 --> 00:31:28.618]  And look up the audit of the Federal Reserve.
[00:31:29.619 --> 00:31:33.162]  See Donald Rumsfeld talking about the 2.3 trade missing from the Pentagon.
[00:31:33.903 --> 00:31:39.428]  Watch the video of the Inspector General of the Federal Reserve saying she doesn't know where $9 trillion is missing.
[00:31:39.768 --> 00:31:44.912]  And then see what you think about these $85 billion budget cuts that are supposed to destroy the nation.
[00:31:46.093 --> 00:31:48.856]  Alright, Lloyd Chapman, ASBL.com.
[00:31:48.876 --> 00:31:49.777]  Thank you for your time, sir.
[00:31:50.097 --> 00:31:50.878]  Thank you for having me.
[00:31:52.142 --> 00:31:54.663]  All right, very insightful from Mr. Lloyd Chapman.
[00:31:55.043 --> 00:32:00.046]  Now, if you'd like to learn more about the Federal Reserve that Mr. Chapman talked about, you can stop by the Infowars store.
[00:32:00.366 --> 00:32:01.667]  We have some great products there.
[00:32:01.687 --> 00:32:04.488]  You can see right there, American Dream and Invisible Empire.
[00:32:04.868 --> 00:32:06.389]  I definitely recommend American Dream.
[00:32:06.429 --> 00:32:12.312]  It's not a children's movie, but if you have a teenager or so, it's a great movie for them to learn about the Federal Reserve.
[00:32:12.712 --> 00:32:14.773]  It's short, it's sweet, it's very entertaining.
[00:32:15.093 --> 00:32:16.734]  I definitely recommend that film.
[00:32:17.034 --> 00:32:18.335]  So stay tuned after this break.
[00:32:18.375 --> 00:32:20.556]  We'll be back with Alex Jones and his special report.
[00:32:24.827 --> 00:32:29.990]  Hi, this is Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, with some news about some new additions to the InfoWars store.
[00:32:30.530 --> 00:32:32.311]  You know good health is freedom.
[00:32:32.571 --> 00:32:35.012]  When you're healthy, you're not a slave to the medical system.
[00:32:35.473 --> 00:32:36.473]  Everything works well.
[00:32:36.533 --> 00:32:38.974]  Your brain, your body, even your spirit.
[00:32:39.275 --> 00:32:40.195]  You're a healthier person.
[00:32:40.415 --> 00:32:49.720]  And to help support that great health, Alex has asked me to source the cleanest, most potent superfoods and other similar products in the world and bring them to the InfoWars store.
[00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:50.761]  So we've done that.
[00:32:51.081 --> 00:32:53.202]  The brand name is Health Ranger Select.
[00:32:53.342 --> 00:32:55.485]  And we're starting out right now with these three products.
[00:32:55.785 --> 00:33:04.615]  We've got Himalayan salt from Pakistan, formed hundreds of thousands of years ago in an ancient seabed, long before modern pollution destroyed much of the oceans.
[00:33:04.935 --> 00:33:10.422]  This is loaded with trace minerals, and it's pristine, true, full-spectrum sea salt.
[00:33:10.882 --> 00:33:13.183]  We've also got Natural Attitude Turmeric.
[00:33:13.504 --> 00:33:17.586]  It's an extract of turmeric, very potent, tastes great, alcohol free.
[00:33:18.106 --> 00:33:20.928]  This is from organic turmeric out of India.
[00:33:21.348 --> 00:33:23.149]  And we've also got Clean Chlorella.
[00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:33.075]  We sourced and did research on all the chlorella sources around the world and we found the two cleanest sources that have the lowest levels of any kind of contaminants.
[00:33:33.376 --> 00:33:37.138]  In fact, this one is virtually free of all metals and all contaminants.
[00:33:37.438 --> 00:33:38.499]  It's called Clean Chlorella
[00:33:39.079 --> 00:33:44.282]  And it's about two-thirds protein and it's got chlorophyll and chlorella growth factor in it.
[00:33:44.762 --> 00:33:45.682]  Check it out online.
[00:33:45.923 --> 00:33:51.325]  It's an amazing superfood that athletes are using and people are using to help support healthy lifestyles.
[00:33:51.385 --> 00:33:52.086]  It's fantastic.
[00:33:52.946 --> 00:33:57.629]  This is all packaged in our certified organic facility here in Central Texas.
[00:33:58.049 --> 00:34:03.972]  There we follow USDA certified standards and we're audited every year by the USDA certifier
[00:34:04.272 --> 00:34:04.552]  I think so.
[00:34:55.034 --> 00:34:59.217]  And for our last segment of the night, we have Alex Jones' special report on the surveillance state.
[00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:04.761]  Well, you've all heard it before.
[00:35:04.921 --> 00:35:06.182]  It can't happen here.
[00:35:06.242 --> 00:35:07.603]  It can't happen in America.
[00:35:08.164 --> 00:35:18.532]  Government-run health care written by big insurance companies doubling premiums in 2013, hammering the poor with gigantic payroll tax increases.
[00:35:19.352 --> 00:35:23.514]  Hundreds of power plants being shut down, massively increasing our power prices.
[00:35:23.994 --> 00:35:31.137]  General Motors being given government bailout money to move its Volt and other Cadillac factories to China.
[00:35:31.637 --> 00:35:36.179]  The NDAA, the secret arrest of Americans, checkpoints on the highways.
[00:35:36.739 --> 00:35:42.301]  Driving to work today, in Austin, Texas, on Sunday, coming in here to fight tyranny.
[00:35:43.341 --> 00:35:45.242]  Because the times have gotten so desperate.
[00:35:45.582 --> 00:35:46.683]  Not once, but twice.
[00:35:47.566 --> 00:35:50.368]  I saw troops directing traffic on the street.
[00:35:51.768 --> 00:35:57.892]  Yesterday, I went to Texas Independence Day rally, an event in Washington, Nebraska.
[00:35:57.952 --> 00:36:01.514]  It's a little town, and they had National Guard there.
[00:36:02.934 --> 00:36:04.936]  It's all about acclimating the public.
[00:36:05.336 --> 00:36:12.580]  The TSA putting their hands on you, sticking their hands in your pants, saying it's for Al-Qaeda, when the government runs Al-Qaeda in Libya and Syria on record.
[00:36:13.504 --> 00:36:16.267]  Criminals took over America.
[00:36:17.068 --> 00:36:28.622]  Foreign corporate interests have captured us and now they want to really exercise their power and put their hands on us and spy on us without warrants and use weaponized drones domestically.
[00:36:29.523 --> 00:36:32.306]  I saw the CNET news article just a few days ago.
[00:36:33.117 --> 00:36:48.224]  Where they openly reported that Homeland Security has programmed the Predator and Reaper drones and others for domestic operations and to read American license plates and to track gun owners and even identify gun owners with guns under their clothing.
[00:36:49.286 --> 00:37:05.911]  We the people are paying for a military to be used against us and a technocratic robotic air force and now a ground force of robots where the power structure openly brags soon they won't need troops anymore because everything is going to be automated.
[00:37:06.903 --> 00:37:19.671]  They're taking our tax money and building a nightmare system of control, and it's all happening like a science fiction movie, because we are in the year 2013, and we have bad people directing our technological development.
[00:37:20.352 --> 00:37:23.454]  Bottom line, I want to say this to the anti-gun people.
[00:37:24.474 --> 00:37:31.379]  You are sold that being anti-gun is like your party winning, and that you get a score against the Republicans.
[00:37:32.367 --> 00:37:33.228]  You can take the guns.
[00:37:33.848 --> 00:37:39.412]  The Republican Party at the highest levels works for the very same globalist interest as Barack Obama.
[00:37:39.752 --> 00:37:44.735]  It's just that Barack Obama is more effective at getting the agenda done.
[00:37:44.755 --> 00:37:48.798]  He's not a lesser of two evils, he's a more effective of two evils.
[00:37:48.878 --> 00:37:55.062]  Mitt Romney supported the semi-auto assault weapons ban and actually got it passed in his state of Massachusetts.
[00:37:55.763 --> 00:38:00.026]  So what I'm trying to get across to you desperately here is this.
[00:38:00.806 --> 00:38:06.954]  It can happen here, it is happening here, and it's going to get worse here if you don't wake up and take action.
[00:38:07.235 --> 00:38:13.523]  When they get rid of the Second Amendment, which they're doing right now, by increment, they're going to get rid of everything else.
[00:38:13.543 --> 00:38:16.347]  And if you notice, Fourth Amendment, First Amendment,
[00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:21.623]  10th Amendment, states' rights, everything is being destroyed right now.
[00:38:21.683 --> 00:38:23.885]  Your medical records are being made public.
[00:38:24.585 --> 00:38:32.511]  It's come out that major grocery stores, the Wall Street Journal reported, what we always knew, sell your data to insurance companies, what you're eating.
[00:38:33.552 --> 00:38:38.355]  And they're now going, well, we're in a socialist system, so what you eat affects me because I've got to pay for you.
[00:38:39.236 --> 00:38:43.039]  Now it's made all your neighbors, like your wife or husband, where they're in your life.
[00:38:43.951 --> 00:38:48.292]  You think you had fights with your wife or husband over how much money you're spending or what you're eating or where you're going?
[00:38:48.512 --> 00:38:50.533]  How about everybody involved in your life now?
[00:38:52.073 --> 00:39:09.838]  Man, to watch them shamelessly take those 20 dead kids and wave the bloody shirt, problem, reaction, solution, when they killed a million Iraqis, most of them children, for so-called oil, and when they had collateral damage, oh Bush, Obama, they'll kill hundreds of people in a village to kill one, quote, bad guy.
[00:39:10.745 --> 00:39:11.746]  Who knows if that's even true?
[00:39:12.006 --> 00:39:13.508]  It's like, oh, collateral damage, no big deal.
[00:39:13.528 --> 00:39:14.349]  There's no crying.
[00:39:14.389 --> 00:39:16.551]  There's no... It's all bull.
[00:39:17.112 --> 00:39:23.599]  Sure, in a perfect world, you could argue that if there were biometrics on guns or something, it might cause less crime.
[00:39:24.139 --> 00:39:27.743]  But the people that want to take the guns are globalist conquerors.
[00:39:28.044 --> 00:39:28.905]  They're criminals.
[00:39:28.985 --> 00:39:30.406]  That's why they want to take the guns.
[00:39:31.027 --> 00:39:32.468]  Not all the reasons they give you.
[00:39:33.109 --> 00:39:34.630]  And that's what's so serious about this.
[00:39:34.690 --> 00:39:40.212]  So, here's my message to the anti-gunners who aren't actually authoritarians, who have been dupes of this.
[00:39:40.912 --> 00:39:42.173]  They're going to take all the rights.
[00:39:42.253 --> 00:39:43.353]  They are taking the rights.
[00:39:43.674 --> 00:39:44.454]  Systematically.
[00:39:45.094 --> 00:39:48.055]  Every other country's had their guns taken except Switzerland and Israel.
[00:39:49.596 --> 00:39:49.876]  Okay?
[00:39:49.996 --> 00:39:51.717]  And Switzerland has the lowest crime rate in Europe.
[00:39:51.897 --> 00:39:53.098]  They're trying to take their guns right now.
[00:39:53.758 --> 00:39:54.978]  Our crime rate's gone down 49% since 1991.
[00:39:55.018 --> 00:39:55.579]  The last 20 years,
[00:39:58.857 --> 00:40:01.299]  It's gone up 49% because gun ownerships exploded.
[00:40:01.619 --> 00:40:10.065]  The gun culture was the bedrock, the only thing left that was about being self-sufficient, taking care of yourself, protecting yourself.
[00:40:10.445 --> 00:40:11.626]  Women were getting into it.
[00:40:12.146 --> 00:40:14.868]  I mean, record sales of Hello Kitty M16s.
[00:40:15.669 --> 00:40:18.110]  Women were jogging now with fanny packs with guns.
[00:40:18.551 --> 00:40:19.852]  Rape was going way down.
[00:40:20.372 --> 00:40:21.853]  Home invasions, carjackings.
[00:40:21.873 --> 00:40:22.513]  I mean, look it up.
[00:40:23.014 --> 00:40:24.255]  We'll show you some of the statistics.
[00:40:24.975 --> 00:40:28.837]  The system is in trouble because the nanny state doesn't want that.
[00:40:28.877 --> 00:40:29.937]  It wants you passive.
[00:40:30.338 --> 00:40:37.401]  Not to build some kumbaya, let's all, you know, get together, let's all, you know, like John Lennon said, love each other.
[00:40:37.901 --> 00:40:41.963]  This is the globalist saying, stand down, turn in your guns, so they can dominate us.
[00:40:43.226 --> 00:40:44.547]  And so you're getting what you want.
[00:40:44.588 --> 00:40:47.991]  Those of you that feel like you're winning, just like you thought you won with Obamacare.
[00:40:48.352 --> 00:40:52.596]  Now they're doubling the premiums, bankrupting everybody, and not covering pre-existing conditions.
[00:40:52.836 --> 00:40:54.979]  The insurance companies owned by big banks wrote it.
[00:40:55.499 --> 00:40:57.161]  It's a total corporate tax.
[00:40:57.722 --> 00:41:00.244]  The Supreme Court ruled it's a tax to corporations.
[00:41:01.326 --> 00:41:03.547]  I mean, but still, you feel like a winner.
[00:41:04.167 --> 00:41:19.194]  And now you're going to feel like a winner as 16 different states are on the verge or have already passed laws banning all semi-autos, making you turn them in, and also arresting people caught with over 7 round or 10 round mags, depending on the state.
[00:41:19.754 --> 00:41:21.495]  And they know gun owners aren't going to turn them in.
[00:41:21.635 --> 00:41:24.636]  It's a new way to persecute gun owners and call us terrorists.
[00:41:24.696 --> 00:41:28.257]  And they've now announced Homeland Security's main job is going after gun owners.
[00:41:28.538 --> 00:41:29.318]  It isn't Al-Qaeda.
[00:41:31.013 --> 00:41:33.855]  Oh, the NSA, the drones, all of it's for gun owners!
[00:41:34.596 --> 00:41:40.721]  Because the foreign powers that have taken over America, the foreign mega-banks that brag that they've conquered this country.
[00:41:41.001 --> 00:41:44.104]  Our article, banks brag they've conquered the US and Europe.
[00:41:44.404 --> 00:41:47.967]  They brag they've conquered us, and they're bringing in a new world order.
[00:41:48.308 --> 00:41:56.955]  Not to give you guys socialism to empower you, but to give you socialism at one level to emasculate you, to make you dependent.
[00:41:58.038 --> 00:41:59.199]  And it is horrible.
[00:41:59.499 --> 00:42:01.480]  And all the gravy train's going to end, folks.
[00:42:01.801 --> 00:42:04.202]  We had incredible prosperity because we had liberty.
[00:42:04.382 --> 00:42:08.725]  We weren't perfect, but we had more economic liberty than any other country the world's ever seen.
[00:42:09.225 --> 00:42:12.607]  And we had half the world's wealth, 5% of the population.
[00:42:12.647 --> 00:42:14.469]  People say, oh, it's because you were militaristic.
[00:42:15.049 --> 00:42:16.750]  All those other countries were militaristic, too.
[00:42:16.770 --> 00:42:18.911]  A lot of them had bigger land mass than we did.
[00:42:19.312 --> 00:42:22.454]  But because we had more liberty, we excelled.
[00:42:22.954 --> 00:42:26.256]  Everybody wanted to come here because we were wide open.
[00:42:28.376 --> 00:42:36.902]  Now, I've addressed the useful idiots out there that are conned by all this and really think that movies are accurate and that you shoot guns and, you know, buildings blow up.
[00:42:38.237 --> 00:42:41.079]  For those of you that don't know that it's just a tool, I feel sorry for you.
[00:42:41.099 --> 00:42:45.063]  I hope you'll go out and take some shooting lessons and demystify it and join the Republic.
[00:42:45.423 --> 00:42:45.823]  I love you.
[00:42:45.863 --> 00:42:46.544]  I care about you.
[00:42:46.784 --> 00:42:47.905]  I want you to have a great future.
[00:42:48.505 --> 00:42:50.127]  Guns are the canary in the coal mine, folks.
[00:42:50.167 --> 00:42:54.250]  They go for those and every society look out and look at what's happening.
[00:42:54.711 --> 00:43:02.297]  Now I have a final message for those that are tyrants like Dianne Feinstein and the Globalists, George Soros and others, Bill Clinton.
[00:43:03.602 --> 00:43:04.843]  You know exactly what you're doing.
[00:43:04.883 --> 00:43:05.844]  You have bodyguards.
[00:43:05.864 --> 00:43:07.024]  You have your own firearms.
[00:43:07.064 --> 00:43:07.705]  You're on record.
[00:43:08.285 --> 00:43:13.909]  And Dianne Feinstein has said many times, if she could get all the guns taken, she'd say, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them in.
[00:43:16.271 --> 00:43:22.295]  Well, she came out last week, and she talked about how, I know it's an uphill battle to get the guns.
[00:43:22.875 --> 00:43:23.756]  That's at the federal level.
[00:43:23.776 --> 00:43:25.257]  They're banning them state by state right now.
[00:43:25.777 --> 00:43:27.598]  But she said, there will be more incidents.
[00:43:27.678 --> 00:43:31.121]  And she went, and did this, but there will be more incidents.
[00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:35.562]  You see, that's their game plan.
[00:43:35.582 --> 00:43:36.622]  We're going to play a clip of that.
[00:43:36.702 --> 00:43:37.903]  There will be more incidents.
[00:43:38.724 --> 00:43:40.685]  These events are going to continue.
[00:43:41.946 --> 00:43:44.247]  Because she knows they can set themselves up.
[00:43:44.547 --> 00:43:46.589]  Here's the gun confiscation plan in a nutshell.
[00:43:47.089 --> 00:43:49.891]  They're setting themselves up as the saviors.
[00:43:50.331 --> 00:43:54.053]  Obama says over and over again, we can't allow this to happen one more time.
[00:43:54.434 --> 00:43:56.475]  We can't have one more kid shot.
[00:43:58.806 --> 00:44:03.287]  And so then when more kids get shot out of 315 million people, it's going to happen.
[00:44:03.627 --> 00:44:05.868]  Statistically, it's way down the line of causes of death.
[00:44:07.468 --> 00:44:09.709]  Even the Justice Department's own memo came out last week.
[00:44:09.729 --> 00:44:15.270]  They said, we might as well just ban all guns, because actual mass shootings are only 35 people a year that are real mass shootings.
[00:44:15.970 --> 00:44:19.651]  Let's just ban everything if you want to cause, you know, violence to, quote, go down.
[00:44:20.529 --> 00:44:21.049]  With guns.
[00:44:41.867 --> 00:44:42.768]  Our right did it.
[00:44:43.328 --> 00:44:45.751]  And it's also free speech is causing problems.
[00:44:45.811 --> 00:44:48.893]  So all of you for free speech, you're causing the problems.
[00:44:48.933 --> 00:44:55.319]  And all of you that are for states' rights or privacy rights, every time there's a problem, it's your fault collectively.
[00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:57.621]  The opposite of a free society.
[00:44:57.941 --> 00:45:00.584]  When someone commits a crime with a car, you're guilty.
[00:45:00.904 --> 00:45:01.605]  All drivers.
[00:45:01.925 --> 00:45:04.147]  When someone commits a crime with a knife, you're guilty.
[00:45:04.547 --> 00:45:05.528]  Anyone who has a knife.
[00:45:06.089 --> 00:45:06.809]  When someone
[00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:09.552]  Some parent abuses their child.
[00:45:09.572 --> 00:45:11.815]  You hear about how bad parents are.
[00:45:12.215 --> 00:45:13.877]  See, you're guilty.
[00:45:14.237 --> 00:45:14.958]  You're bad.
[00:45:15.298 --> 00:45:18.222]  That's pure authoritarianism.
[00:45:18.242 --> 00:45:22.747]  That's the heart of communism, socialism, fascism, oligarchy.
[00:45:22.847 --> 00:45:23.608]  Study history.
[00:45:24.625 --> 00:45:35.751]  And so their plan is to every time there's a shooting, play it up, blame us, oh my god the gun owners, they're the terrorists, they're the criminals, as they flip the entire homeland security apparatus.
[00:45:36.311 --> 00:45:44.956]  And the troops on the streets and the TSA checkpoints, they're now having gun checkpoints in Texas they call anti-gang on major highways where they search your car without warrants.
[00:45:45.296 --> 00:45:49.639]  This is the essence of authoritarianism and it's all done not to fight Al Qaeda now.
[00:45:50.239 --> 00:46:03.654]  But to fight gun owners, returning veterans, those that believe in a second coming of Christ, libertarians, in the fetters, people that like Patriot documentary films, like Aaron Russo's documentary, America, Freedom to Fascism.
[00:46:03.954 --> 00:46:05.156]  This is what they list.
[00:46:05.456 --> 00:46:06.657]  This is what they train for.
[00:46:08.779 --> 00:46:27.467]  95% of the training manuals that we've shown you on air, that we've published, that Washington's blog did a great job showing, 18 pages of their manuals, 18 pages of links on public manuals that they give out to ice cream shops and barbers and tattoo parlors saying, if somebody gets an American flag, call the police.
[00:46:27.847 --> 00:46:29.908]  If somebody gets a tattoo of a gun, call the police.
[00:46:30.169 --> 00:46:32.850]  To get everybody to be Stasi tattletales.
[00:46:33.450 --> 00:46:50.584]  We are converting to an authoritarian system and the reason it's happening, the reason it's happening is because the tyrants and their agents, their front people like Dianne Feinstein have created over a thousand trillion in derivatives that they have signed us onto.
[00:46:50.644 --> 00:46:51.424]  It's not our debt.
[00:46:52.025 --> 00:46:59.330]  And they are planning on fully imploding the society and using poverty as a tool of control where they come back in with government
[00:47:00.171 --> 00:47:00.331]  Well,
[00:47:15.089 --> 00:47:15.209]  Yes.
[00:47:34.365 --> 00:47:48.654]  Exempt from all the national laws, combining the money and the funds into their coffers, shutting down industry in Europe and America, shipping the jobs to China where the globalists own the factories, shutting down our power plants while opening their power plants.
[00:47:48.914 --> 00:47:51.676]  It's a monopoly game where they have everything rigged.
[00:47:52.489 --> 00:47:57.331]  And now they're entering the endgame of trying to make you debt slaves under Agenda 21.
[00:47:57.791 --> 00:47:59.431]  Telling you there won't be streetlights anymore.
[00:47:59.991 --> 00:48:01.512]  Oh, there isn't an American dream.
[00:48:01.552 --> 00:48:02.692]  It's an American nightmare.
[00:48:02.712 --> 00:48:03.712]  It's good for the environment.
[00:48:04.193 --> 00:48:08.694]  This is such an authoritarian, technocratic system we're facing.
[00:48:08.934 --> 00:48:14.676]  So if you love your children, I mean not just my children, every time I see other people's children, every time I'm out in crowds of people, I almost start crying.
[00:48:15.376 --> 00:48:19.599]  I had to come in here on Sunday morning and I called Rob Dewey and I said, do you care about this?
[00:48:19.619 --> 00:48:20.140]  Are you upset?
[00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:24.163]  He said, yeah, I'll come in and help you on a Sunday and left his children and his wife to come down here.
[00:48:24.904 --> 00:48:26.665]  You see, I'm working seven days a week.
[00:48:26.745 --> 00:48:29.507]  I'm dreaming about this stuff because I've studied it.
[00:48:30.048 --> 00:48:32.209]  All I think about is this because it's normal.
[00:48:33.070 --> 00:48:34.632]  We are under authoritarian threat.
[00:48:34.652 --> 00:48:36.253]  We're under predator threat here.
[00:48:36.834 --> 00:48:38.336]  And you should have chills right now.
[00:48:38.616 --> 00:48:41.179]  You should be upset about how diabolical this is.
[00:48:41.539 --> 00:48:46.104]  And all you've got to do to defeat it is to speak out against it, is to see it.
[00:48:46.664 --> 00:48:49.247]  But what it's got going for it is how horrible it is.
[00:48:49.647 --> 00:48:51.770]  That's what Dianne Feinstein's got going for her.
[00:48:52.310 --> 00:49:01.338]  That's what all these globalist slime bags have going for them, is the system is so horrible and so evil, it's so over the top, the average person just can't imagine it.
[00:49:01.638 --> 00:49:04.561]  So I'm begging you, get out of the learned helplessness.
[00:49:04.621 --> 00:49:06.383]  Get out of the mass Stockholm Syndrome.
[00:49:07.475 --> 00:49:08.915]  Get out of your normalcy bias.
[00:49:09.656 --> 00:49:17.218]  Jews and others in the concentration camps just got used to watching people work to death and then shot every day, whoever couldn't work anymore.
[00:49:17.578 --> 00:49:21.319]  And they just got to where it was normal and wouldn't even fight back when it came to be their time.
[00:49:21.679 --> 00:49:23.219]  Same thing happened in the Soviet gulags.
[00:49:23.559 --> 00:49:25.060]  Alexander Solzhenitsyn talked about it.
[00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:28.661]  Same thing's been written by people that survived the Maoist camps.
[00:49:29.361 --> 00:49:31.603]  I mean, folks, I've seen this so many times through history.
[00:49:31.923 --> 00:49:32.483]  I've studied it.
[00:49:32.543 --> 00:49:34.105]  I've interviewed the survivors of it.
[00:49:34.665 --> 00:49:36.506]  This is really bad, okay?
[00:49:37.167 --> 00:49:38.648]  It's not about liberals and conservatives.
[00:49:38.668 --> 00:49:41.910]  That's all just the fake window dressing to make you think there's a choice.
[00:49:42.271 --> 00:49:44.653]  We're in deep, deep trouble.
[00:49:45.673 --> 00:49:50.297]  In the last two days, three times, I've seen regular army and others on the streets.
[00:49:50.617 --> 00:49:54.740]  There's now TSA checkpoints downtown Austin on the news.
[00:49:55.761 --> 00:49:57.402]  See, I told you years ago it was coming to your town.
[00:49:57.462 --> 00:49:58.383]  Now it's where I live.
[00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:06.184]  It's going to get worse and worse, and it's always reasonable reasons to acclimate the troops, the police, and you.
[00:50:06.424 --> 00:50:11.869]  We're all being conditioned for a larger plan, and that's why they're moving so quick.
[00:50:11.889 --> 00:50:13.090]  They're getting ready to implode things.
[00:50:13.350 --> 00:50:23.177]  But if we're aware of the fact that they're behind it, they won't implode things, or they may back off partially, or even if they do implode things, we have a better chance of beating them long term.
[00:50:23.638 --> 00:50:29.142]  But bottom line, laying down to these people, acting like sheep, only encourages them.
[00:50:30.330 --> 00:50:32.391]  A nation of sheep will be ruled by wolves.
[00:50:32.531 --> 00:50:34.212]  Stop being so compliant.
[00:50:34.612 --> 00:50:35.812]  Stop going along.
[00:50:36.132 --> 00:50:37.233]  Start speaking out.
[00:50:37.533 --> 00:50:40.794]  Start spreading the word about real media that tells the truth.
[00:50:41.474 --> 00:50:45.036]  Warn everybody you know, because we're all in grave danger.
[00:50:45.156 --> 00:50:47.877]  If you love your children, get out of your coma.
[00:50:48.177 --> 00:50:49.678]  Get out of your learned helplessness.
[00:50:49.698 --> 00:50:51.078]  Get out of your normalcy bias.
[00:50:51.398 --> 00:50:56.560]  Get out of the mindset and the attitude that, oh, it's not your job, or there's nothing you can do about it.
[00:50:57.240 --> 00:50:58.041]  Or there's no future.
[00:50:58.860 --> 00:51:04.703]  I'd tell people 10 years ago, 15 years ago, NSA, Project Echelon, was spying on everything you did illegally.
[00:51:04.963 --> 00:51:07.284]  You're like, you're a kook, that's illegal, that never happened.
[00:51:07.584 --> 00:51:11.647]  Now it comes out that everything I said was accurate, it was public then, too.
[00:51:12.027 --> 00:51:14.268]  And people are like, okay, so what, big deal, nothing you can do about it.
[00:51:15.148 --> 00:51:17.710]  I mean, folks, they're putting cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[00:51:18.010 --> 00:51:21.131]  They know the aspartame gives you type 2 diabetes, that's why it's up by 3000%.
[00:51:23.539 --> 00:51:25.040]  I mean, it's in the news now!
[00:51:25.381 --> 00:51:29.524]  They're putting plastic in the products, in the milk and stuff, to give you kidney failure.
[00:51:29.984 --> 00:51:30.985]  They're killing us!
[00:51:31.245 --> 00:51:32.926]  They know the flu shot gives you the flu.
[00:51:33.227 --> 00:51:34.668]  Folks, it's so horrible!
[00:51:35.248 --> 00:51:40.012]  Everywhere I go, there's like kids with neurological disorders and people, they're murdering us!
[00:51:40.092 --> 00:51:40.832]  It's upsetting!
[00:51:40.852 --> 00:51:42.514]  I don't want to just sit here and take it!
[00:51:43.234 --> 00:51:47.720]  And fighting with the stupid brainwashed minions, the cops and people, doesn't do anything either.
[00:51:47.980 --> 00:51:49.242]  They're being targeted as well.
[00:51:49.522 --> 00:51:50.644]  It's an info war.
[00:51:50.964 --> 00:51:52.646]  We've got to wake people up.
[00:51:53.006 --> 00:51:54.148]  They're launching the drones.
[00:51:54.168 --> 00:51:55.169]  They're launching it all.
[00:51:55.349 --> 00:51:59.094]  They're coming on us because they're coming against us now.
[00:51:59.815 --> 00:52:01.916]  Because they know their time is short.
[00:52:02.136 --> 00:52:04.757]  This is an incredible time in history to be alive.
[00:52:04.997 --> 00:52:08.179]  For God's sakes, folks, don't just support InfoWars.com.
[00:52:08.439 --> 00:52:09.580]  Don't just spread the word about us.
[00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:11.160]  Get the word out at your church.
[00:52:11.220 --> 00:52:12.201]  Get the word out at work.
[00:52:12.561 --> 00:52:13.582]  Speak out everywhere.
[00:52:13.782 --> 00:52:15.582]  And if your church won't talk about it, leave.
[00:52:15.843 --> 00:52:16.663]  Take people with you.
[00:52:16.683 --> 00:52:17.643]  Start your own church.
[00:52:18.444 --> 00:52:20.265]  I mean, this is an emergency, folks.
[00:52:20.705 --> 00:52:22.586]  And remember, a lot of you won't listen now.
[00:52:22.606 --> 00:52:24.987]  You'll make jokes out of this, your defense mechanism.
[00:52:27.585 --> 00:52:48.755]  But down the road, as more and more of this happens, and as you see everything being shut down, and as you see the depression rolled out in increments, and those that engineered it always posing as the saviors, as you see all this unfold, you've already seen everything else we talked about unfold, and people trying to rationalize that and make excuses, and desperately find something we were wrong about, so you could discredit what we're saying.
[00:52:49.115 --> 00:52:50.716]  What we're telling you is in plain view.
[00:52:51.596 --> 00:52:53.659]  We don't deserve a pat on the back for telling you this.
[00:52:53.980 --> 00:52:54.821]  I'm not a hero.
[00:52:55.061 --> 00:52:55.963]  I want to survive.
[00:52:56.163 --> 00:52:57.505]  I want my children to have a future.
[00:52:57.826 --> 00:53:02.072]  This is an exterminist, ultra-Hitlerian, eugenicist-based system.
[00:53:02.452 --> 00:53:03.494]  And if you don't know what a...
[00:53:04.682 --> 00:53:08.765]  Eugenicist, ultra-Hitlerian based system is, you better look up eugenics.
[00:53:09.165 --> 00:53:11.347]  You better look up Malthusianism.
[00:53:11.767 --> 00:53:13.628]  You better look up the New World Order.
[00:53:13.888 --> 00:53:15.709]  You better look up Agenda 21.
[00:53:15.990 --> 00:53:24.775]  You better look up smart meters, that are literally a robot attached to the side of your house, bathing you in high powered RF waves, and stealing all your data.
[00:53:24.996 --> 00:53:28.958]  Just like the Google cars, I told you a decade ago, were stealing your data.
[00:53:29.178 --> 00:53:34.222]  Came out last year, they're driving around with government codes, breaking into everything, stealing your photos.
[00:53:35.344 --> 00:53:38.813]  Your passcodes, your mail, because it's the NSA!
[00:53:39.074 --> 00:53:40.738]  And the NSA is an American!
[00:53:40.939 --> 00:53:42.563]  It's a foreign banking cartel!
[00:53:43.638 --> 00:53:45.179]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, it's up to you.
[00:53:45.379 --> 00:53:54.885]  I'm just here, a watchman on the wall, 21st century Paul Revere, just like you are, trying to get you out of your coma, trying to get you out of your trance, trying to get you to think for yourselves.
[00:53:55.446 --> 00:53:59.408]  I'm Alex Jones, signing off from the front lines of the InfoWars, for InfoWars.com.
[00:53:59.688 --> 00:54:01.750]  The gun confiscation has begun.
[00:54:02.130 --> 00:54:05.072]  The persecution, the purge of gun owners is beginning.
[00:54:05.532 --> 00:54:11.155]  And it's only going to get worse unless we really get aggressive and call out the tyrants for what they are.
[00:54:11.595 --> 00:54:15.297]  A bunch of sick freaks trying to protect their criminal takeover.
[00:54:18.319 --> 00:54:21.040]  Ask yourselves, what are you doing in this time of great challenge?
[00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:24.542]  What are you doing to unlock mine?
[00:54:25.442 --> 00:54:32.346]  Go to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv for the latest headlines and cutting-edge information.
[00:54:36.272 --> 00:54:37.673]  So great job, Alex.
[00:54:37.773 --> 00:54:38.534]  Definitely exciting.
[00:54:39.074 --> 00:54:41.716]  Even on vacation, he seems to get those things out.
[00:54:42.076 --> 00:54:44.098]  So very exciting, very in-depth.
[00:54:44.859 --> 00:54:48.141]  A longer piece than we're used to, but not used to from Alex.
[00:54:48.421 --> 00:54:50.443]  But anyway, that's it for the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:54:50.803 --> 00:54:52.004]  I'm your host, Jakari Jackson.
