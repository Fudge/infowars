[00:00:07.878 --> 00:00:21.912]  Since 2010, Walmart has spearheaded a see something, say something campaign by broadcasting 1984-esque messages from Homeland Security head Janet Napolitano that encourages Walmart shoppers to spy on each other.
[00:00:21.932 --> 00:00:27.757]  Hi, I'm Janet Napolitano, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.
[00:00:28.658 --> 00:00:31.861]  Homeland security begins with hometown security.
[00:00:32.964 --> 00:00:38.088]  That's why I'm pleased that Walmart is helping to make our communities more safe and secure.
[00:00:38.929 --> 00:00:44.513]  If you see something suspicious in the parking lot or in the store, say something immediately.
[00:00:44.913 --> 00:00:51.859]  So it should be no surprise that police visited a father of three this weekend after he went to Walmart with his children to cash a check.
[00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:56.803]  Walmart security alerted authorities to a possible kidnapping of three young girls.
[00:00:57.443 --> 00:01:03.766]  All because the security guard thought it was strange that the girls weren't the same race as their white father.
[00:01:04.106 --> 00:01:09.929]  Police who were at his home when he arrived made the oldest child confirm that the man with them was their father.
[00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.390]  But this is not new.
[00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:20.495]  In 2009, a couple lost custody of their children when Walmart photo center employees alerted police to pictures they thought were akin to child porn.
[00:01:21.235 --> 00:01:25.518]  The photos were of the couple's children taking baths and being wrapped in towels.
[00:01:25.879 --> 00:01:28.721]  That couple is now in the midst of a lawsuit with Walmart.
[00:01:29.261 --> 00:01:40.590]  Back in 2010, when Big Sis became the head of the Walmartian Snoop Society, Alex Jones had plenty to say about the DHS's invasion into our lives under the threat of a terrorist attack.
[00:01:41.718 --> 00:01:43.679]  Well, it's here.
[00:01:43.699 --> 00:01:44.440]  1984 in America.
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.902]  This is the straw that breaks the camel's back.
[00:01:46.942 --> 00:01:50.464]  There is no doubt that we're in deep trouble as a society.
[00:01:50.984 --> 00:02:08.216]  The head of Homeland Security, Big Sis, Janet Napolitano, has now come out and announced that over 800 Walmarts in the next month are going to install telescreens at the checkout scanner with different federal orders to spy on the other people shopping.
[00:02:09.502 --> 00:02:24.666]  But don't worry, as we reported in 2011, if you're one of the many good citizens that are reporting suspicious activity, Homeland Security wants to shield you from facing the consequences of misidentifying innocent behavior as extremism or terrorism.
[00:02:25.066 --> 00:02:32.627]  Of course, this will only encourage an army of ill-equipped citizen spies to report any behavior whatsoever, no matter how benign.
[00:02:33.308 --> 00:02:35.008]  See something, say something.
[00:02:35.688 --> 00:02:38.789]  Unless, of course, you're blowing the whistle on government corruption, and then, you know,
[00:02:39.617 --> 00:02:40.298]  Mom's the word!
[00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:44.942]  I'm Leanne McAdoo and this has been an InfoWars Nightly News Alert.
