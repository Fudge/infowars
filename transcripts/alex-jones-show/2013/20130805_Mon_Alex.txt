[00:00:06.465 --> 00:00:10.668]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:12.110]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:13.771]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.432 --> 00:00:18.035]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.635 --> 00:00:22.718]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.996 --> 00:00:45.187]  When it comes to the general police state and world government being openly rolled out, this broadcast is basically becoming passÃ©.
[00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:57.940]  So much of what I have specifically analyzed and warned people about, just learning how the globalists operate worldwide, is now right out in the open.
[00:00:59.801 --> 00:01:22.639]  But on their master plan, and what they're doing to our genetics, and what they're doing to the Earth's species, uh, flora, on that subject, my friends, the public has really no clue just how serious the situation has gotten.
[00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.221]  So I am going to attempt
[00:01:31.281 --> 00:01:45.786]  in the broadcast today to look at some of these different facets that we face as a civilization and as a society.
[00:01:46.907 --> 00:01:53.329]  Kathryn Albrecht, security researcher, Dr. Kathryn Albrecht will be joining us to talk about the waterfront
[00:01:54.642 --> 00:02:04.431]  of NSA spying issues, you name it, and the whole transhumanist movement coming up in the third hour today and popping in for about 15-20 minutes.
[00:02:05.011 --> 00:02:14.820]  Brandon Toye, whose resignation letter as a defense contractor has gone viral, he's going to be popping in as well, but we will also have open phones.
[00:02:20.387 --> 00:02:31.635]  Obviously we're going to get into the new expanding global terror alert and the controlled state-run media is saying obviously we've got to get rid of all freedom now.
[00:02:32.674 --> 00:02:40.477]  After this devastating, credible threat, no one has seen anything so frightening and so scary.
[00:02:40.537 --> 00:02:42.358]  Aren't you scared, General Aydin?
[00:02:42.738 --> 00:02:43.638]  Yes, I'm scared.
[00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:45.599]  Aren't you scared, General Alexander?
[00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:48.040]  Oh, I'm very scared.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.661]  You watch this.
[00:02:49.741 --> 00:02:51.701]  It's like a Monty Python skit.
[00:02:55.743 --> 00:03:00.365]  I'm convinced that if Hitler would have said, give up your rights, America, our Muslim extremist will get you.
[00:03:01.465 --> 00:03:07.890]  That America would have run up, you know, swastikas or something and bowed to Hitler or Stalin or any other authoritarian.
[00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.574]  I mean, this is just cuckoo-level transparent.
[00:03:13.214 --> 00:03:18.378]  And they're saying, we got the same chatter pre-9-11, RACE FORWARD!
[00:03:18.398 --> 00:03:23.122]  And I've got videos pouring in all over the country, an orgy of grandstanding.
[00:03:24.773 --> 00:03:30.596]  With police just everywhere, just setting up random checkpoints and running up people in grocery store parking lots.
[00:03:30.696 --> 00:03:33.577]  I'm going to search you with no warrant, I do what I want!
[00:03:34.678 --> 00:03:42.062]  A homeless guy, you know, a cop gets in his face and a homeless guy says, what are you going to do, bleepers, as he pulls a gun out and shoots him in the chest.
[00:03:42.102 --> 00:03:45.444]  And the police are going, well, we may allow that, actually.
[00:03:45.464 --> 00:03:49.245]  I mean, it is all just going into hyper-warp insanity.
[00:03:49.886 --> 00:03:51.667]  And it's not just the government.
[00:03:52.438 --> 00:03:53.399]  That's going crazy.
[00:03:53.759 --> 00:04:06.108]  They believe they're above the law, so you're seeing some of the most wild manifestations where TSA people will just jump on top women now at the TSA or take their clothes off and run around naked screaming, I'm God.
[00:04:06.488 --> 00:04:07.789]  That's happened quite a few times.
[00:04:10.371 --> 00:04:20.678]  Or SWAT teams arrive at an animal sanctuary where they have a baby deer with armored vehicles and machine guns and kill the deer and then write tickets and fines running around crazy.
[00:04:23.004 --> 00:04:28.507]  The general public, and I know you're seeing this, is losing touch with reality.
[00:04:28.587 --> 00:04:32.309]  And it's because of television and the smartphones and all of it.
[00:04:32.369 --> 00:04:37.912]  I mean, we are going to see, we are going to see societal meltdown.
[00:04:38.893 --> 00:04:42.375]  And the culture's going to go crazy.
[00:04:42.395 --> 00:04:46.317]  I'm afraid there's going to be large regional wars very soon.
[00:04:47.566 --> 00:04:50.548]  And they don't even care if nuclear reactors meltdown now.
[00:04:50.568 --> 00:04:51.589]  They just say that's healthy.
[00:04:52.309 --> 00:04:54.010]  90 plus percent of reactors are leaking.
[00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.192]  I think you're going to see reactors blowing up.
[00:04:56.372 --> 00:05:00.595]  I mean, I just think you're going to see judgment, judgment on this world.
[00:05:01.807 --> 00:05:05.449]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us?
[00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:10.952]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[00:05:11.192 --> 00:05:18.735]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[00:05:18.936 --> 00:05:28.040]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:35.247]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[00:05:35.408 --> 00:05:38.271]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[00:05:38.291 --> 00:05:45.218]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse, but demand a war.
[00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:48.130]  Another plane just hit!
[00:06:02.631 --> 00:06:15.781]  With over 3,000 years of historic use, Pure Silver continues to be one of nature's most reliable and effective agents against fighting viruses, mold, fungus, bacteria, pathogens and parasites.

[00:08:13.468 --> 00:08:21.213]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:31.397 --> 00:08:48.994]  I'm going to be honest with you, ladies and gentlemen, and talk about just personal reflections that I'm having in personal quiet time, when you are able to just briefly glimpse the secret place
[00:08:49.975 --> 00:08:52.496]  Of the Most High, as the Bible says.
[00:08:52.556 --> 00:08:56.358]  In fact, I wasn't intending to do this on air now, but I was going to do it later.
[00:08:56.378 --> 00:09:00.479]  But will you guys pull me up the verse of dwelling in the secret place of the Most High?
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.440]  I want to be able to read that full verse to people.
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:11.023]  And even if you don't believe in God, believe in spirituality, believe in an afterlife, believe in things outside of our five senses, which we know are there.
[00:09:12.044 --> 00:09:14.365]  In fact, most of the universe is outside of our five senses.
[00:09:14.705 --> 00:09:17.706]  And the sixth sense has been documented
[00:09:19.771 --> 00:09:22.772]  But I had a real moment of clarity this morning.
[00:09:23.132 --> 00:09:26.954]  Well, more than a moment, it was about an hour of clarity.
[00:09:28.615 --> 00:09:44.841]  And I want to try to, feebly as I may, transmit that information, at least from my perspective, and hopefully it can help you, and then you can obviously comment on InfoWars.com.
[00:09:46.544 --> 00:09:51.007]  Just call into the show and give me your take on it as well, and together we can become stronger.
[00:09:52.228 --> 00:09:54.089]  It's the 91st Psalm.
[00:09:54.369 --> 00:10:03.575]  He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High shall remain stable and fixed under the shadow of the Almighty, whose power no foe can withstand.
[00:10:05.276 --> 00:10:08.559]  I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress, my God.
[00:10:09.219 --> 00:10:14.683]  On Him I lean and rely, and in Him I confidently trust.
[00:10:15.779 --> 00:10:26.946]  That's right, you've got to have a North Star, and all the psychological studies show this, that the most free and prosperous cultures the world has ever seen have been truly Christian.
[00:10:28.147 --> 00:10:33.951]  The problem is, is that the wealth that those societies create then creates decadence and the fall.
[00:10:34.471 --> 00:10:43.077]  And we saw this with Israel in its thousands of pre-Christian years, when they would follow
[00:10:44.286 --> 00:10:56.057]  God's commandments and become incredibly successful and powerful and then become decadent and leave the commandments and then be overrun with the corrupt and then finally collapse and go into bondage.
[00:10:57.979 --> 00:11:01.423]  But I want to say that verse again to everybody out there before I get into the news.
[00:11:04.025 --> 00:11:04.726]  May we dwell
[00:11:06.277 --> 00:11:08.159]  In the secret place of the Most High.
[00:11:08.939 --> 00:11:18.868]  He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High shall remain stable and fixed under the shadow of the Almighty, whose power no foe can withstand.
[00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:26.674]  Just saying that verse, I can feel the secret place of the Most High.
[00:11:27.715 --> 00:11:28.656]  And I feel ashamed.
[00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:39.195]  I feel ashamed of who I am and of all of my imperfections when I glimpse from afar the secret place of the Most High.
[00:11:39.776 --> 00:11:42.437]  I do not dwell in the secret place of the Most High.
[00:11:43.718 --> 00:11:49.421]  But just like the silver lining of a cloud, I am able to see just the edge of it.
[00:11:50.502 --> 00:11:53.364]  And there is great peace and great majesty therein.
[00:11:56.065 --> 00:11:58.527]  And I think about what's happened in our culture.
[00:11:59.651 --> 00:12:09.938]  I think about everything that I see, and all the psychology, and all the psychological warfare I've studied, and all the public relations and PR that I've studied, that I use none of.
[00:12:11.079 --> 00:12:14.981]  I've gone and studied what the deceivers do, and they themselves are deceived.
[00:12:15.221 --> 00:12:16.042]  The most deceived.
[00:12:19.644 --> 00:12:23.947]  They're now rolling out the fact that they have been deceiving us, but claiming that it was for our own good.
[00:12:24.207 --> 00:12:27.670]  That itself, another deception within a deception, within a deception.
[00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:29.191]  But it really hit me.
[00:12:34.341 --> 00:12:38.845]  An image of astronauts spacewalking.
[00:12:39.605 --> 00:12:43.709]  This is my allegory, or my analogy, or my parable.
[00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:59.162]  I've seen interviews with astronauts that have done the big extended spacewalks, going out and working on the International Space Station, working on their module, working on their capsule, working on the space shuttle when there's a problem.
[00:13:01.161 --> 00:13:02.322]  Going out to do repairs.
[00:13:03.103 --> 00:13:22.581]  And they describe the first time you do it, even though you've been trained, when you come out and you're looking into the deepness of eternity and space, and then looking down hundreds of miles towards the earth, that it is a frightening but also exhilarating and gripping feeling.
[00:13:23.803 --> 00:13:31.169]  And that you feel almost a zen timelessness of all that was, is, and will be.
[00:13:31.189 --> 00:13:51.366]  And it's a thousand times that exhilarating but also frightening feeling to stand on the edge of a cliff looking down thousands of feet into a gorge and a river below and to feel a gust of wind blow from behind you and almost have you topple down to your death.
[00:13:52.361 --> 00:14:20.864]  You see eternity laying there before you, and whether you consciously admit it or not, your spirit, your gut, your soul, your genetics, your cells that grew out of this creation, whether you believe or God or not, you are part of this creation and connected to all of it, you sense something a thousand times being on the edge of the cliff, a thousand times spacewalking,
[00:14:23.106 --> 00:14:27.369]  And experiencing something that humans in their entire development never experienced.
[00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:51.188]  It is beyond that that you are in eternity and that we are all on an incredible spacewalk right now on this planet with all of this mystery and majesty and the relationships and the men, the women, the children, your ancestors, the people you currently know, and those that will come in the future.
[00:14:51.308 --> 00:14:52.609]  It is an epic
[00:14:55.183 --> 00:14:56.064]  Epic adventure!
[00:14:57.625 --> 00:15:24.486]  And then I see the general public, and all the studies show this, becoming more narcissistic, more megalomania is popping up, more people are going insane, believing that they're movie stars, that they're rock stars, more people are becoming arrogant and spiteful, and cheating their friends and family, and thinking that because they have knowledge of evil and are engaged in it, that somehow they've got power.
[00:15:26.311 --> 00:15:29.232]  That's because they have no North Star.
[00:15:29.292 --> 00:15:32.714]  They have no secret place of the Most High.
[00:15:34.475 --> 00:15:36.416]  They don't even have a connection to that.
[00:15:36.576 --> 00:15:41.398]  They can't even imagine that in their heart of hearts.
[00:15:41.839 --> 00:15:44.420]  And so they're just running wild.
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:54.627]  Completely freaked out, completely scared, thinking, oh, Madison Avenue in Hollywood says that if I looked like a supermodel, I'd be happy.
[00:15:55.208 --> 00:15:56.248]  And then you grow old.
[00:16:00.812 --> 00:16:06.616]  And it's not about your grandchildren or your husband or your children or about helping orphans.
[00:16:07.297 --> 00:16:13.602]  It's about how you're not beautiful anymore, in quotes, and so you degenerate and become a wicked old witch.
[00:16:18.337 --> 00:16:33.466]  Or you struggle your whole life and have a wife and children, but you want to be a rap star, or you want to be a rock star, or you want to be a top basketball player, or you want to be a movie star, and because you were never able to do that, you're totally unhappy and have a nervous breakdown.
[00:16:33.787 --> 00:16:45.494]  I can't tell you how many people I have known throughout my life, friends, family, neighbors, you name it, that don't become as successful as they wanted to be and then have a nervous breakdown and go insane.
[00:16:46.983 --> 00:16:48.644]  All of you right now know people that have done that.
[00:16:49.244 --> 00:16:51.605]  That's the most common thing that makes people go insane.
[00:16:52.346 --> 00:16:56.768]  Or they get incredible success and then go on a power trip and go crazy.
[00:16:57.509 --> 00:17:01.211]  When everything that you could ever want was right there.
[00:17:01.511 --> 00:17:10.115]  Friends, family, being honorable, being loving, being strong, being heroic, being true.
[00:17:10.896 --> 00:17:13.517]  But the world tells you those things are a joke.
[00:17:13.797 --> 00:17:15.178]  Those things make you fail.
[00:17:19.397 --> 00:17:20.878]  And the truth is, that's a lie.
[00:17:22.859 --> 00:17:24.239]  And it just hit me this morning.
[00:17:24.279 --> 00:17:29.321]  I went for a jog for a couple miles and then walked back early in the morning.
[00:17:29.822 --> 00:17:30.802]  And it was so beautiful.
[00:17:31.882 --> 00:17:36.765]  The trees and the flowers and the rabbit I saw run across the path and a babbling brook.
[00:17:40.566 --> 00:17:42.987]  Staring into the blue sky that went on for eternity.
[00:17:47.769 --> 00:17:48.890]  That I was gripped
[00:17:52.079 --> 00:17:57.662]  With the understanding of the cycles that humanity has gone through.
[00:17:59.343 --> 00:18:09.608]  And it was so sad to realize how shuttered, how closed in, how dumbed down, how unaware of the average person is.
[00:18:09.768 --> 00:18:11.569]  And it's been done artificially.
[00:18:14.821 --> 00:18:19.204]  It's been done artificially by this sick, modern culture.
[00:18:19.264 --> 00:18:22.085]  And it's not technology itself that's evil.
[00:18:22.726 --> 00:18:26.227]  It is the architecture of the way it's been deployed.
[00:18:28.689 --> 00:18:33.892]  For full-spectrum dominance is just a blasphemous crime against our species.
[00:18:35.874 --> 00:18:42.199]  And I think about third world villages I've been in with poor children, with cane poles, with electricity in their eyes.
[00:18:42.759 --> 00:18:46.582]  So happy to be staring into a beautiful stream, catching fish.
[00:18:47.202 --> 00:18:58.030]  And then I think about rich, wealthy, decadent children, totally confused, totally upset, running to and fro to playdates and events and, and, and...
[00:18:59.191 --> 00:19:14.588]  Different activities desperately looking for fulfillment with their mothers and their fathers desperately looking for fulfillment when fulfillment was already there in the secret place of the most time.
[00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:18.392]  And that the whole world has now been built
[00:19:19.429 --> 00:19:20.109]  Even of old!
[00:19:20.529 --> 00:19:46.560]  The old temples, the old systems, the old art of the secret priesthoods, to suppress the fact that majesty and wonder and creation is all around us, and that we are fulfilled by simply breathing air into our lungs, and that we are now being put into a fully artificial cage, an artificial habitat, a giant electromagnetic gulag,
[00:19:48.567 --> 00:19:53.230]  In the preparation for world mass extermination.
[00:19:54.631 --> 00:19:55.472]  And it's all public.
[00:19:56.072 --> 00:19:56.713]  It's all admitted.
[00:19:57.593 --> 00:20:00.716]  The NSA is on record spying on the general public.
[00:20:00.756 --> 00:20:01.937]  We're going to get to that when we come back.
[00:20:01.997 --> 00:20:06.100]  Now there's an amazing new natural antibiotic every person must have.
[00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:08.181]  It's Cells Alive Silver Solution.
[00:20:08.281 --> 00:20:13.004]  And it destroys over 650 hard to kill viruses, fungus, bacteria, and much more.
[00:20:13.185 --> 00:20:16.647]  Cells Alive Silver Solution has no expiration date, is great for
[00:20:16.647 --> 00:20:16.927]  I don't know.
[00:20:31.664 --> 00:20:32.744]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:20:32.824 --> 00:20:37.145]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:20:37.325 --> 00:20:42.947]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:20:43.027 --> 00:20:46.367]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:20:46.608 --> 00:20:49.168]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[00:21:01.411 --> 00:21:06.272]  There are those curious about bitcoins and those using and making money with bitcoins.
[00:21:06.752 --> 00:21:07.953]  What are bitcoins?
[00:21:08.393 --> 00:21:14.474]  A bitcoin is the first decentralized currency that can be easily transferred from person to person over the internet.
[00:21:14.875 --> 00:21:16.315]  No bank needed.
[00:21:16.695 --> 00:21:21.996]  This means lower fees and accounts can never be frozen, limited or closed.
[00:21:22.376 --> 00:21:24.157]  You are in control of your money.
[00:21:24.637 --> 00:21:25.438]  And the best part?
[00:21:25.819 --> 00:21:29.043]  You can start earning and making money with bitcoins right away.
[00:21:29.443 --> 00:21:36.852]  No computer or expertise is required to earn money with bitcoins and a growing number of merchants now accept bitcoins.
[00:21:37.312 --> 00:21:40.977]  Plus, they're easily exchanged for dollars, euros and more.

[00:22:00.925 --> 00:22:02.105]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:22:02.366 --> 00:22:12.809]  Myself, my family, the Infowars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[00:22:13.029 --> 00:22:19.931]  Infowars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats, but we can't do that without your help.
[00:22:20.231 --> 00:22:22.972]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts,
[00:22:23.012 --> 00:22:24.613]  It's at Infowars.com.

[00:22:31.496 --> 00:22:34.758]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[00:22:34.998 --> 00:22:40.581]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[00:22:41.121 --> 00:22:50.631]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[00:22:51.012 --> 00:22:52.193]  The war is here.
[00:22:52.513 --> 00:22:53.915]  It's an info war.
[00:22:54.415 --> 00:22:56.157]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[00:23:00.962 --> 00:23:04.507]  Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins.
[00:23:04.847 --> 00:23:05.568]  That bears repeating.
[00:23:05.868 --> 00:23:09.373]  Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins.
[00:23:09.733 --> 00:23:13.998]  And Pro-EM1 Daily Probiotic Cleanse is the key to digestive health.
[00:23:14.299 --> 00:23:19.786]  Pro-EM1 is a powerful liquid probiotic, strong enough to cleanse, gentle enough to use every day.
[00:23:20.146 --> 00:23:22.347]  Pro-EM1 is dairy, wheat, and soy free.

[00:23:25.108 --> 00:23:27.009]  Contains no preservatives or animal products.
[00:23:27.269 --> 00:23:29.210]  Supports a healthy digestive and immune system.
[00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:30.090]  Supports weight loss.
[00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:31.871]  Improves absorption of food nutrients.
[00:23:32.211 --> 00:23:33.572]  Aids in controlling yeast infections.
[00:23:33.832 --> 00:23:35.072]  Is never freeze-dried.
[00:23:35.412 --> 00:23:39.274]  And uses three groups of live, viable, beneficial microbes to cleanse and remove toxins.
[00:23:39.634 --> 00:23:43.055]  Order Pro-EM1 Daily Probiotic Cleanse at Terragonics.com.

[00:23:49.678 --> 00:23:50.118]  That's 866-369-3678.
[00:23:50.138 --> 00:23:51.219]  Pro-EM1, the raw probiotic.
[00:24:08.638 --> 00:24:13.763]  I'm going to get into the giant new developments on the NSA front actually at the start of the next segment.
[00:24:15.424 --> 00:24:19.108]  I want to finish up with just the desperation of our decadent society.
[00:24:20.569 --> 00:24:21.370]  And we know where it's going 100%.
[00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:25.833]  It's historically a cycle and we know exactly what's going to happen.
[00:24:25.853 --> 00:24:29.675]  And I want to break down just in generality what we're facing.
[00:24:29.995 --> 00:24:33.518]  And then coming up, exclusive Reuters reports, U.S.
[00:24:34.378 --> 00:24:39.302]  directs agents to cover a program used to investigate Americans for common crimes.
[00:24:40.903 --> 00:24:46.507]  And it goes on to say that marijuana, you name it,
[00:24:48.743 --> 00:24:52.546]  Watering your lawn on the wrong day, the NSA gets all that and gives it to local government.
[00:24:53.046 --> 00:24:55.168]  Yeah, that's what the threat fusion centers are for.
[00:24:56.048 --> 00:25:02.513]  But then they play games and go, we don't spy, we just gather the data, and the computer makes the decisions, so that makes it okay.
[00:25:02.533 --> 00:25:06.616]  Kind of like the family that Googled last week, the Italian family in Florida.
[00:25:07.616 --> 00:25:09.137]  No criminal record, it's a nice family.
[00:25:09.178 --> 00:25:13.601]  Googled, uh... Googled, uh, pressure cooker.
[00:25:14.650 --> 00:25:17.533]  You know, to order one, I've got a couple pressure cookers to cook things.
[00:25:17.553 --> 00:25:18.313]  I guess I'm a terrorist.
[00:25:18.794 --> 00:25:22.637]  And then separately, their kids were getting ready to go to school, so the next day they looked up backpacks.
[00:25:23.278 --> 00:25:24.559]  And so they got a SWAT team right.
[00:25:27.482 --> 00:25:29.724]  And remember, the government runs al-Qaeda on record.
[00:25:29.744 --> 00:25:32.786]  We're going to get to the whole fake terror alerts, all of it in the next segment.
[00:25:33.527 --> 00:25:35.289]  So some big news breaking right now.
[00:25:36.809 --> 00:25:55.953]  While the globalists, under international treaty, wire all the electronics so they can surveil and take control of them, and then go, oh my gosh, we need bigger government agencies to counter the hackers, because now they can hack your smartphone, hack your washing machine, hack your smart meter, hack your toilet.
[00:25:56.013 --> 00:25:58.753]  That's luxury toilet users warned of hardware flaw.
[00:25:59.154 --> 00:26:01.114]  The hackers may flood your house with them.
[00:26:05.011 --> 00:26:06.933]  This is such a sick joke, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:06.973 --> 00:26:09.837]  We are building the pit for our own destruction.
[00:26:10.257 --> 00:26:13.941]  By the way, I have an article out of Reuters again.
[00:26:14.482 --> 00:26:20.429]  They said there's an emergency with radioactivity spewing out of the five reactors that blew up in Japan.
[00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:22.552]  How many years are we into this now?
[00:26:24.468 --> 00:26:29.852]  Three months into it, they caught yellowfin tuna and bluefin in the Pacific off the coast of California.
[00:26:29.892 --> 00:26:36.096]  So radioactive that just eating it is guaranteed to take many years off your life, the government decided to not tell you.
[00:26:36.717 --> 00:26:39.839]  But it came out a year after they'd... I mean, boy, let me tell you.
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:43.282]  Alarms go off in Southern California on the reactors now?
[00:26:43.642 --> 00:26:44.362]  What's their answer?
[00:26:44.683 --> 00:26:45.883]  They turn the alarms off.
[00:26:45.903 --> 00:26:50.086]  91% of global reactors, the 425 or whatever it is, are leaking.
[00:26:54.801 --> 00:26:59.343]  Uranium, plutonium, everything else, ladies and gentlemen, to the point now, they're just like, you know what?
[00:26:59.723 --> 00:27:00.884]  We're gonna let them leak.
[00:27:01.504 --> 00:27:02.484]  Don't worry about it.
[00:27:05.786 --> 00:27:10.988]  It's like a science fiction movie, like they're space aliens that live in a radioactive environment and want to radiate us.
[00:27:11.048 --> 00:27:13.509]  I mean, it's like you gotta think of some reason they do that.
[00:27:13.689 --> 00:27:15.070]  But no, they just have a death wish.
[00:27:17.099 --> 00:27:19.220]  It's what psychopaths always do in history.
[00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:21.081]  They just want to get caught.
[00:27:21.141 --> 00:27:22.242]  They want to hurt themselves.
[00:27:22.282 --> 00:27:28.985]  Their own hardwiring, even though they're consciously and spiritually a psychopath, still the humanity in them wants to destroy them.
[00:27:30.426 --> 00:27:32.347]  And so they manifest it.
[00:27:32.367 --> 00:27:35.529]  So they want to destroy themselves with us, of course, along with them.
[00:27:37.149 --> 00:27:38.310]  And that's what I wanted to get to.
[00:27:39.471 --> 00:27:42.192]  People are freaked out by the fact that they're only alive once.
[00:27:42.652 --> 00:27:43.593]  They're totally
[00:27:45.054 --> 00:27:57.187]  Freaked out by the fact that they were born and they're living and then they'll die and they're on a planet where they, you know, dig up all these bones of woolly mammoths and saber-toothed tigers and mastodons and 20-foot sloths.
[00:27:58.479 --> 00:28:00.520]  That was just 10,000 years ago, you know, they think.
[00:28:00.561 --> 00:28:16.752]  And then you go back before that, there's all these dinosaurs and plesiosaurs and 50-foot-long great white megalodon sharks and there's a big moon orbiting and rainstorms come by and lightning and just there's insects everywhere and bacteria.
[00:28:16.772 --> 00:28:20.615]  I mean, we are living just... I just walk around marveling.
[00:28:21.468 --> 00:28:31.172]  At an ant bed, or at birds, or at the sky, or at my children, or at just literature, classical music.
[00:28:31.192 --> 00:28:39.835]  It's just every day is a blessing, every day is a banquet, every day is just an over-the-top hallucination of reality.
[00:28:45.257 --> 00:28:47.558]  Reality is a hallucination of consciousness.
[00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:51.981]  What do you call a hallucination?
[00:28:52.742 --> 00:28:57.286]  You know, that's when your mind, when you have a fever, whatever the case is, distorts what it's seeing.
[00:28:57.306 --> 00:28:58.607]  But I mean, what do you call reality?
[00:28:58.808 --> 00:29:06.495]  When you think about reality, when you think about the nature of it, when you think about what you could build and do, they call that a hallucination.
[00:29:06.535 --> 00:29:07.516]  No, they call that thought.
[00:29:09.417 --> 00:29:15.363]  And so, deep down, everybody knows that they are in the middle of just an incredibly heavy event.
[00:29:17.506 --> 00:29:35.584]  And they sense that the establishment's gone insane and does not have their best interest at heart, and now they know the system's lying to them, so it's like a giant spacewalk, or standing at the edge of a cliff, and then people are running towards all the baubles and all the fame and all the ego stuff, thinking that is something they can cling to.
[00:29:37.435 --> 00:29:38.035]  Well, it's not.
[00:29:38.115 --> 00:29:44.898]  You've got to just turn loose in the sea of reality, and then you will dwell in the secret place of the most high.
[00:29:45.258 --> 00:29:48.160]  Then you will suddenly realize there's something else there.
[00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:49.580]  It's God.
[00:29:51.041 --> 00:29:51.941]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.441 --> 00:29:54.042]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.983 --> 00:29:57.644]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:30:11.993 --> 00:30:18.355]  Listen, there is some real scum in the alarm business cashing in by locking you into long, punishing contracts.

[00:31:02.093 --> 00:31:06.674]  There's a false sense of security that the greatest economic crash since the Great Depression is over.
[00:31:06.754 --> 00:31:12.616]  But unemployment is still at a 20-year high, and until Americans are working again, the economy has not recovered.
[00:31:12.716 --> 00:31:14.477]  What is the smartest investment you can make?

[00:33:12.426 --> 00:33:15.929]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:33:16.509 --> 00:33:18.371]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:19.352 --> 00:33:30.581]  Coming to you live from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin, broadcasting worldwide, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:33:31.081 --> 00:33:32.663]  Why do we have the name Prison Planet?
[00:33:33.496 --> 00:33:34.897]  Well, that's what's being constructed.
[00:33:35.257 --> 00:33:36.298]  That's not my opinion.
[00:33:37.039 --> 00:33:49.368]  When I get up here and I talk about world government being established for forced population reduction of 80 to 99 percent, depending on which globalist policy report you read, that is not my opinion.
[00:33:49.408 --> 00:33:50.128]  That is on record.
[00:33:51.429 --> 00:33:56.673]  When I say the establishment plans to basically end the family, that is on record as well.
[00:33:57.114 --> 00:33:59.575]  And I've made films, we've had countless guests on.
[00:34:00.196 --> 00:34:02.558]  When you hear the radical things we talk about here,
[00:34:04.378 --> 00:34:11.953]  On the broadcast, you need to understand that almost in every case over 90% of the time it's something that's already admitted on record.
[00:34:12.930 --> 00:34:14.971]  I know it freaked out one of my reporters last week.
[00:34:15.051 --> 00:34:34.704]  I said, go look up these notes, pull these articles, since you've already done a report on this, and pull up DynCorp Halliburton, child kidnapping rings, DynCorp running the CPS in most states, CPS having pedophile, convicted pedophiles as their directors in states like Florida and other states in the past.
[00:34:35.585 --> 00:34:37.967]  Look up snuff films connected to it.
[00:34:38.869 --> 00:34:43.613]  And then, about a day later, she was real freaked out by it and said, oh my God, there's thousands of articles about this.
[00:34:44.174 --> 00:34:47.437]  The UN's involved, they're all, it's horrible, the government's evil!
[00:34:47.457 --> 00:34:49.339]  And I'm like, yes, they're evil.
[00:34:50.059 --> 00:34:50.440]  I know.
[00:34:53.222 --> 00:35:05.033]  And I think about all the people crying out in the darkness, crying out in bondage, all the women, all the children, all the innocents, crying out to God, or just crying out saying, somebody help me!
[00:35:07.386 --> 00:35:15.510]  And all these big churches just say, you come here, you pray, you give us money, you do what the government says, you don't make waves, that's how you help the innocent.
[00:35:16.171 --> 00:35:28.577]  And the abortion continues, and now the infanticide and the euthanasia of old people, and the television has taken over our culture, and society's breaking down, and decadence is just skyrocketing.
[00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:36.762]  And I prayed to God to protect me from the evil this morning.
[00:35:37.822 --> 00:35:42.506]  And from the insanity that's going to be poured out on the people.
[00:35:44.868 --> 00:35:54.256]  I mean, I can intellectually look at everything that's happening and historically where it goes, and the cycles of humans, the cycles of decadence that are as accurate as an atomic clock.
[00:35:55.196 --> 00:35:59.800]  Or as the sun coming up in the east and setting in the west.
[00:36:02.903 --> 00:36:05.385]  It is absolute fact
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:29.393]  That we are going to enter into something that looks like a high-tech blending of every tyranny, every oppression, every nightmare system the world's ever seen, with every psychopathic control freak demon, with whatever their flavor of enjoyment is, turned loose on the face of this earth.
[00:36:31.642 --> 00:36:33.804]  And I'm just desperately trying to get people ready.
[00:36:34.304 --> 00:36:38.827]  I've been trying to hold it back, but I really have come to the realization it is not going to be held back.
[00:36:40.709 --> 00:36:47.734]  All we can do is individually try to get ready for it and try to warn others so that if they have eyes to see, ears to hear, they can be warned.
[00:36:52.477 --> 00:36:53.958]  And I'm very sad for people.
[00:36:57.441 --> 00:36:58.502]  I'm very, very sad.
[00:37:00.128 --> 00:37:06.572]  For all the tough guy wannabes and all the crazy brave and all the trendies and everybody else.
[00:37:11.535 --> 00:37:15.437]  I've just come to the realization that I'm not going to be able to help most people.
[00:37:15.457 --> 00:37:17.219]  They're going to put cancer viruses in your children.
[00:37:17.239 --> 00:37:18.920]  They're going to kill them early.
[00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:20.521]  They're going to poison the water.
[00:37:20.561 --> 00:37:21.781]  We're probably not going to get that out.
[00:37:22.302 --> 00:37:25.964]  They're going to spray our atmosphere and get rid of the ozone layer for whatever reason they're doing it.
[00:37:26.324 --> 00:37:27.085]  They already detonated.
[00:37:29.326 --> 00:37:32.268]  Over a hundred hydrogen bombs in the upper atmosphere trying to ignite it.
[00:37:32.788 --> 00:37:33.808]  Our own government did that.
[00:37:34.789 --> 00:37:38.071]  They even have Discovery Channel shows about it with William Shatner.
[00:37:40.112 --> 00:37:53.179]  And they'll probably just go ahead and have more reactors melt down and they'll plant GMO everywhere and it'll go from a 3,000% increase in cancer to a 10,000% increase like it is already in children.
[00:37:54.839 --> 00:37:57.141]  Everybody will just start dying and that's what everybody wants.
[00:37:58.237 --> 00:37:59.238]  That's what everybody's gonna get!
[00:37:59.418 --> 00:38:13.173]  So, uh, I'm more concerned about the soul of people as I realize that the flesh being attacked is only a symptom of the larger disease.
[00:38:18.519 --> 00:38:21.640]  And at a certain point, you just gotta put the information out and turn loose.
[00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:28.521]  Because I realize, fighting with people, and desperately trying to wake them up, they've been pre-programmed to withdraw from that.
[00:38:31.322 --> 00:38:34.362]  So it's best to just tell people that, well, you've made your decision.
[00:38:35.323 --> 00:38:37.283]  Because deep down, they all know the truth.
[00:38:40.624 --> 00:38:46.105]  Last night, I went by myself after work at about 7 o'clock to see a movie called, uh...
[00:38:47.515 --> 00:38:54.519]  The two guns, or two guns, with Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg, because I like both actors.
[00:38:55.239 --> 00:38:57.860]  And I knew it would be a mindless shoot-em-up movie.
[00:38:59.001 --> 00:39:08.926]  And it wasn't as good as Shooter, where it's really accurate false flag, it isn't over-the-top, the stuff he can do, it's pretty realistic, and one of the best films out there to understand what runs our government.
[00:39:10.177 --> 00:39:17.540]  I don't know Mark Wahlberg, and I haven't tried to get in touch with him, but definitely that guy's picking scripts that, you know, are dealing with what's really going on.
[00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:30.426]  This new movie has the CIA dealing the drugs, and has the Navy and the Marines dealing drugs and stealing money at the top, and has the police involved in it.
[00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:38.095]  And the entire government's corrupt and evil and dealing the drugs.
[00:39:38.595 --> 00:39:40.298]  And then they go, that's just the way it is.
[00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:46.148]  And I guarantee you, Wahlberg in Washington probably thought, oh, this is good to expose how the world really works.
[00:39:46.448 --> 00:39:48.371]  But really, it's just a coming out of the evil.
[00:39:49.349 --> 00:39:50.630]  Yeah, the government deals the drugs.
[00:39:50.970 --> 00:39:52.110]  Yeah, the government runs everything.
[00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:56.072]  And we're still going to put you in a private prison when we catch you using them.
[00:39:56.772 --> 00:39:59.894]  And it was shot in Texas, and I haven't recognized some of the towns.
[00:39:59.914 --> 00:40:01.254]  They have the state police in it.
[00:40:03.155 --> 00:40:05.376]  It was pretty ridiculous overall.
[00:40:05.416 --> 00:40:06.296]  Not a very good movie.
[00:40:07.177 --> 00:40:12.379]  But it's got the actor that plays Chet in Weird Science.
[00:40:12.399 --> 00:40:12.919]  What's his name?
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:15.060]  What do you mean they got the power?
[00:40:16.321 --> 00:40:17.261]  Yeah, Phil Paxton.
[00:40:18.202 --> 00:40:18.802]  Bill Paxton.
[00:40:22.987 --> 00:40:24.468]  But that wasn't the issue.
[00:40:24.548 --> 00:40:30.330]  When I go see these movies like Olympus Fallen and stuff, I watch who comes into the movie.
[00:40:32.711 --> 00:40:35.712]  And these two special forces guys, but very young.
[00:40:36.233 --> 00:40:42.835]  I can even tell if they're special forces, if they're cops, if they're FBI, if they're federal marshals.
[00:40:42.855 --> 00:40:44.136]  I mean, I can just profile now.
[00:40:44.916 --> 00:40:45.436]  I tested.
[00:40:45.536 --> 00:40:46.577]  I asked them.
[00:40:48.214 --> 00:40:51.735]  I watch these guys come in and sit down next to me and order their drinks and foods.
[00:40:51.755 --> 00:40:54.136]  You can get, you know, food and drinks at this theater.
[00:40:54.577 --> 00:40:55.497]  It's Alamo Draft House.
[00:40:57.078 --> 00:40:57.958]  It's now going nationwide.
[00:40:57.978 --> 00:40:58.658]  It's a great model.
[00:41:01.419 --> 00:41:11.924]  And I'm sitting there and I'm looking in the audience and I'm watching the police because I'm actually about a third of the audience was military police.
[00:41:12.144 --> 00:41:13.444]  This is the movies that are targeting them.
[00:41:15.465 --> 00:41:17.566]  And there were these
[00:41:19.139 --> 00:41:20.701]  Army Rangers sitting next to me.
[00:41:24.826 --> 00:41:28.150]  As you can tell, they're trying to go for special forces above that.
[00:41:29.778 --> 00:41:40.646]  And I watch them glued to the movie, and glued to the programming, and glued to the military officers, and them getting all chastened like, you know, like my dogs when I come in and get the dinner food out, you know, Pavlovian-ly, just right there.
[00:41:41.166 --> 00:41:43.068]  And I sat there and realized what little boys they were.
[00:41:43.088 --> 00:41:46.590]  And at the end, I left a few minutes early because I could tell it was about to end.
[00:41:46.610 --> 00:41:47.331]  You know, I walked out.
[00:41:47.351 --> 00:41:48.272]  I didn't want to miss the crowd.
[00:41:48.912 --> 00:41:51.054]  And I stood there and watched the very end, and then walked out.
[00:41:51.414 --> 00:41:52.595]  And I said, hey, are you in the Army?
[00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:59.231]  And that guy looks at me, and of course these guys even had a little bit longer hair, because I could tell they were involved in domestic operations.
[00:41:59.511 --> 00:42:02.552]  They went to see this movie because, see this is the main lining of it all.
[00:42:03.512 --> 00:42:05.692]  And I think I was like, yeah, how do you know that?
[00:42:06.533 --> 00:42:09.233]  And I'm sitting there looking, and I was like, I said, oh, I just, you know, I could tell.
[00:42:09.433 --> 00:42:10.053]  And I got up and left.
[00:42:10.433 --> 00:42:18.395]  But I was, I was, I went and saw Olympus Has Fallen a few months ago, and I saw the cop
[00:42:19.855 --> 00:42:21.916]  Who had threatened to arrest me at the Austin airport.
[00:42:22.557 --> 00:42:26.920]  This was in far west Austin where I went and saw it just to go analyze it.
[00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:38.907]  And I see him walk in with his wife and he goes and sits down and he watches the movie and he's getting tears in his eyes during a fantasy of the White House being attacked and how this is real.
[00:42:38.927 --> 00:42:44.331]  Then he goes and works at the airport and imagines the fantasy of real terrorists and North Koreans attacking.
[00:42:44.551 --> 00:42:49.094]  And I could pick out the other cops and the other milit- I mean it's just fantasy land folks.
[00:42:50.563 --> 00:42:51.343]  It's fantasy land.
[00:42:51.383 --> 00:42:54.464]  One time they had Navy SEALS guarding Bush during the disputed election.
[00:42:54.764 --> 00:42:59.765]  And I saw these Navy SEALS walking along, surveilling myself, already dealt with Secret Service, you name it, covering it down there.
[00:43:00.105 --> 00:43:01.605]  And I said, what are Navy SEALS doing here?
[00:43:02.265 --> 00:43:04.266]  And they went, Jones, Mike Hanzel, Santa Mesa.
[00:43:04.306 --> 00:43:06.206]  And they go, we don't know how you know that.
[00:43:07.026 --> 00:43:07.966]  And we're blown away.
[00:43:08.326 --> 00:43:12.047]  They turned red-faced like I was, like I was Zeus or something.
[00:43:12.127 --> 00:43:15.588]  I mean, I know, I know what a monarch butterfly looks like.
[00:43:15.888 --> 00:43:17.308]  I know what a raccoon looks like.
[00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:19.930]  I mean, I know what things look like.
[00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:21.431]  I see it a couple times, I know.
[00:43:21.571 --> 00:43:23.091]  Because you guys are all programmed.
[00:43:25.192 --> 00:43:26.712]  You follow a program.
[00:43:26.752 --> 00:43:28.112]  You follow a download.
[00:43:28.352 --> 00:43:29.953]  You follow a body language.
[00:43:30.213 --> 00:43:33.113]  So I know you, because you're not real!
[00:43:33.874 --> 00:43:35.674]  You are a biological android.
[00:43:35.694 --> 00:43:37.334]  You've not chosen consciousness.
[00:43:37.815 --> 00:43:39.415]  You were programmed by television.
[00:43:39.615 --> 00:43:41.515]  You're there at the movie to be programmed.
[00:43:42.916 --> 00:43:45.496]  Reprogrammed, upgraded with your newest baloney.
[00:43:45.956 --> 00:43:47.817]  And you were all in there watching a movie.
[00:43:50.407 --> 00:43:55.391]  Where all the government agencies are dealing drugs, and at the end, they basically keep the money.
[00:43:56.472 --> 00:43:57.552]  Or it's left nebulous.
[00:44:01.215 --> 00:44:04.778]  And the message is, everybody deals drugs, everybody... I mean, it's just so ridiculous.
[00:44:05.058 --> 00:44:11.563]  And it was all meant to target archetypes of the Mexican drug dealers, and the... It's just so disgusting, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:44:13.064 --> 00:44:14.625]  Let me tell you, the drugs aren't sexy.
[00:44:14.645 --> 00:44:15.025]  You know what it is?
[00:44:15.085 --> 00:44:17.547]  It's a baby starving to death in a crib with flies all over it.
[00:44:18.328 --> 00:44:19.789]  That's your manly drug dealing.
[00:44:21.645 --> 00:44:29.988]  And just the ridiculous posing of the guys with their guns and the way that, and I see the cops and the SWAT teams and the TSA on the streets, all like they've arrived.
[00:44:30.008 --> 00:44:30.908]  It's like dress up.
[00:44:31.328 --> 00:44:35.349]  Why not just wear a crown like the Queen of England and show up and say you've saved the earth?
[00:44:38.931 --> 00:44:46.153]  But I mean, it shakes me up that now I'm accurate about
[00:44:47.452 --> 00:44:54.555]  Well, I mean, over the last few months, I'll say, so you're a software engineer, which you manage about 50 people, and they're like, how do you know that?
[00:44:54.595 --> 00:44:57.896]  Well, Lawson has a lot of them, and I can see your bearing, and, you know, see the way you're acting.
[00:44:57.916 --> 00:45:07.280]  And I've just seen so many software engineers, and the way you're acting, but also you have a knowing look, like you've dealt with a lot of people, and you know what torture that is, managing people.
[00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:10.721]  I mean, I just, I just, I can profile people like that now.
[00:45:11.542 --> 00:45:13.022]  Especially government people.
[00:45:13.342 --> 00:45:14.443]  I can tell a school teacher.
[00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:20.314]  Most of them are nice, but you can tell the one at the park bossing their kids around, acting real weird, looking at you.
[00:45:20.974 --> 00:45:23.556]  They'll start a conversation with you just to boss you around.
[00:45:23.917 --> 00:45:25.098]  I can tell bureaucrats.
[00:45:25.958 --> 00:45:29.861]  I can tell cops when they're off duty, out somewhere because they feel uncomfortable.
[00:45:29.881 --> 00:45:32.203]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[00:45:32.283 --> 00:45:33.764]  And I can see all the programming.
[00:45:34.064 --> 00:45:45.053]  And the reason it's so easy to tell who you are and what you are and what you've done is because, again, you follow from birth what you've been programmed with.
[00:45:46.257 --> 00:45:47.358]  Well, let me tell you what I'm following.
[00:45:47.498 --> 00:45:50.400]  I'm following my instinctive programming God gave me.
[00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:53.141]  I'm following what my ancestors did.
[00:45:53.602 --> 00:45:55.663]  I'm following real survival instincts.
[00:45:56.043 --> 00:46:00.186]  And I've accessed a weapons platform that all of us actually have.
[00:46:02.247 --> 00:46:05.369]  All of you are intelligent, ladies and gentlemen, if you ever taught how to use it.
[00:46:06.991 --> 00:46:08.912]  And we are weapon systems.
[00:46:10.131 --> 00:46:12.032]  To adapt and overcome all those terms.
[00:46:12.793 --> 00:46:18.857]  But it all becomes a bunch of meaningless chimpanzee behavior where they all bow down to the head gorilla.
[00:46:19.197 --> 00:46:25.521]  That's what the police are, the military, all these fake hierarchies are for people that are followers.
[00:46:25.641 --> 00:46:34.046]  And most people are followers at one level or another, but these are hyper followers where you don't have any of your own consciousness.
[00:46:35.888 --> 00:46:37.589]  And you are totally in bondage.
[00:46:38.888 --> 00:46:48.795]  And the public is sold that somebody who's in the Navy SEALs or Special Forces is like a Superman and another person.
[00:46:49.896 --> 00:46:53.279]  Let me tell you, their discs go out in their back, they can't get out of bed just like you.
[00:46:54.139 --> 00:47:04.887]  And most of them are little boys who physically can train and do a bunch of stuff and have been told they're Superman so that they believe they can do more when nobody else is told they can do more.
[00:47:04.947 --> 00:47:05.107]  See?
[00:47:06.178 --> 00:47:12.502]  And they're actually, they're totally expendable to be used and then basically discarded.
[00:47:15.204 --> 00:47:26.951]  And that's why they target former special forces, number one, the most surveilled group in this country, because when they become men and become older, then they understand the propaganda.
[00:47:27.811 --> 00:47:30.373]  And then they're truly dangerous, because now they're conscious.
[00:47:30.793 --> 00:47:33.715]  Now they're tying in
[00:47:35.029 --> 00:47:40.912]  To their instincts, their ancestors, everything that is a real man or is a real woman.
[00:47:41.212 --> 00:47:48.435]  And that's what the globalists fear, is that you'll simply go back to being a human and it's magnificent.
[00:47:48.655 --> 00:47:50.196]  We're made in the image of the Creator.
[00:47:50.456 --> 00:47:52.797]  And I'm sorry to do 47 minutes of preaching here today.
[00:47:53.237 --> 00:47:55.038]  I've got all this incredibly important news.
[00:47:56.759 --> 00:47:59.740]  It's just important to realize that
[00:48:03.809 --> 00:48:09.254]  When you serve the New World Order, consciously, all of us make compromises.
[00:48:09.314 --> 00:48:10.035]  Nobody's perfect.
[00:48:10.075 --> 00:48:12.357]  I'm not some Pharisee up here judging people.
[00:48:12.577 --> 00:48:15.239]  If your heart's in the right place, that's what God judges.
[00:48:20.164 --> 00:48:28.932]  But when you start to move to make the attempt to change things, there are also good forces in this universe, and providence will come to your aid.
[00:48:31.121 --> 00:48:34.222]  But you need to know you're not your own man, you're not your own woman.
[00:48:34.642 --> 00:48:48.648]  If you believe the hype of Hollywood and the devilish music that targets little girls, they already targeted the men with soft Satanism in the 80s and 90s.
[00:48:48.988 --> 00:48:54.890]  They're now targeting 8-year-old girls with sexualized Satanism in every major rap and
[00:48:56.397 --> 00:49:03.018]  Rock and roll and pop music out there, and the people go public and say, I've been told to do this, or I won't be on television.
[00:49:03.118 --> 00:49:03.879]  Why is that?
[00:49:04.479 --> 00:49:06.879]  Because the devil is real, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:15.381]  Call it a space alien, whatever you want to call it, there is a dark energy in this universe that wants to destroy humanity.
[00:49:16.441 --> 00:49:20.042]  And God has given us free will to decide what we choose.
[00:49:20.342 --> 00:49:23.763]  And again, even if you don't believe in spiritual things, there is evil.
[00:49:23.863 --> 00:49:25.263]  The atheist will tell you there isn't evil.
[00:49:25.981 --> 00:49:27.781]  They're all just biological androids.
[00:49:27.821 --> 00:49:28.602]  They're programmable.
[00:49:28.922 --> 00:49:30.922]  Okay, well then why do the globalists want to program us?
[00:49:31.402 --> 00:49:32.963]  Because, see, they believe they have free will.
[00:49:33.183 --> 00:49:34.383]  They want to take my free will.
[00:49:34.683 --> 00:49:35.544]  I do have free will.
[00:49:39.525 --> 00:49:41.965]  The great mystery is, do all of us have free will?
[00:49:43.826 --> 00:49:48.047]  There is undoubtedly free will that runs stronger in certain bloodlines.
[00:49:48.814 --> 00:49:50.295]  The establishment knows that as well.
[00:49:50.836 --> 00:50:02.725]  I have found the controllers themselves, actually the most evil, are not even operating at any level as what you'd call a human possession, whatever you want to call it.
[00:50:02.985 --> 00:50:04.066]  They do not have free will.
[00:50:06.188 --> 00:50:07.549]  Some of their top generals
[00:50:08.737 --> 00:50:17.764]  Some of their top enforcers have free will, because they need the speciality of free will and the depth it brings to be able to defeat those of us that have free will.
[00:50:18.524 --> 00:50:25.169]  But if anyone asks what my mission is, it is to try to get you to unlock your mind to ask God into your heart.
[00:50:25.650 --> 00:50:31.634]  You're not going to find in these churches, but you will find when you ask God to come to your aid, because God is waiting to come to your aid.
[00:50:32.174 --> 00:50:34.476]  And that's what this society and this world needs.
[00:50:34.796 --> 00:50:35.517]  I'm done preaching.
[00:50:35.977 --> 00:50:37.698]  When we come back... Oh!
[00:50:39.219 --> 00:50:39.339]  Oh!
[00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:41.341]  Exclusive Reuters!
[00:50:42.983 --> 00:50:51.370]  The FBI is with the NSA tracking everything you do, including petty crime, with the NSA system.
[00:50:51.470 --> 00:50:52.230]  Of course they are.
[00:50:52.891 --> 00:50:54.392]  See, it's all the coming out here.
[00:50:54.713 --> 00:50:56.214]  Of course, they don't stop the petty crime.
[00:50:58.156 --> 00:51:00.698]  They only have a few snacks for public consumption.

[00:52:01.087 --> 00:52:05.671]  There's a false sense of security that the greatest economic crash since the Great Depression is over.
[00:52:05.751 --> 00:52:11.597]  But unemployment is still at a 20-year high, and until Americans are working again, the economy has not recovered.
[00:52:11.717 --> 00:52:13.479]  What is the smartest investment you can make?
[00:52:13.639 --> 00:52:14.139]  It's food.

[00:54:19.289 --> 00:54:23.711]  Before we ever pass this way again.
[00:54:36.530 --> 00:54:37.250]  We're gonna ride.
[00:54:37.370 --> 00:54:40.352]  Ride like the one-eyed Jack of Diamonds.

[00:55:08.465 --> 00:55:09.186]  Make no mistake.
[00:55:12.629 --> 00:55:21.237]  Ladies and gentlemen, let me get to the big breaking news and we're going to have a guest coming on who's stood up and done the right thing and got a lot of attention.
[00:55:22.077 --> 00:55:23.178]  But look at these headlines.
[00:55:23.258 --> 00:55:24.580]  Exclusive, they tell you!
[00:55:25.879 --> 00:55:26.881]  It's really not exclusive.
[00:55:27.321 --> 00:55:33.131]  Now it's safe for the controlled press that they've been authorized to report on this to put out what's actually been going on for at least 20 years.
[00:55:33.812 --> 00:55:36.015]  Everything you do on the phone, cell phone...
[00:55:37.250 --> 00:55:39.791]  Uh, faxes, then emails, is all tracked.
[00:55:40.391 --> 00:55:45.112]  And it's then handed out to local police at the threat fusion centers.
[00:55:45.953 --> 00:55:46.333]  U.S.
[00:55:46.353 --> 00:55:50.034]  directs agents to cover up program used to investigate Americans.
[00:55:50.914 --> 00:55:51.894]  A secretive U.S.
[00:55:51.934 --> 00:55:53.415]  Drug Enforcement Administration.
[00:55:53.435 --> 00:55:56.716]  Yeah, it's so secret they've got a substation a half mile from my house.
[00:55:57.748 --> 00:55:58.748]  They all think they're movie stars.
[00:55:58.788 --> 00:56:04.551]  I drive by, they got all these new Corvettes and stuff they use to set people up and all these women, these good-looking women they've got as operatives.
[00:56:04.591 --> 00:56:09.013]  You drive by them and they've always got their sunglasses standing around the parking lot talking to each other.
[00:56:09.033 --> 00:56:10.153]  They're all movie stars.
[00:56:10.433 --> 00:56:11.654]  You're all walking dead.
[00:56:11.674 --> 00:56:14.335]  You've already been injected with cancer viruses by your masters.
[00:56:15.436 --> 00:56:16.696]  A bunch of government drug dealers.
[00:56:17.176 --> 00:56:18.917]  Anyways, excuse me, let's continue here.
[00:56:19.497 --> 00:56:25.260]  They use this, the NSA I told you is to control the drug trade and take down anybody that doesn't pay their cut.
[00:56:26.809 --> 00:56:32.771]  But it doesn't matter, you're agents with the government, and you drive Corvettes, so it's okay.
[00:56:34.032 --> 00:56:35.052]  A secretive U.S.
[00:56:35.112 --> 00:56:44.696]  Drug Enforcement Administration unit is funneling information from intelligence intercepts, wiretaps informants.
[00:56:45.277 --> 00:56:51.719]  Hey, I read some article where in 5,000 plus crimes were allowed to be committed just in one area by the FBI, by their informants.
[00:56:52.039 --> 00:56:53.540]  Oh yeah, their informants can kill whoever they want.
[00:56:55.057 --> 00:57:04.795]  Informants and a massive database of telephone records to authorities, not servants, they're authorities, across the nation to help them launch criminal investigations of Americans!
[00:57:06.345 --> 00:57:10.748]  And it goes on to admit that it's non-terror related.
[00:57:11.469 --> 00:57:29.702]  Although these cases were rarely involved in national security issues, documents reviewed by Reuters show that law enforcement agents have been directed to conceal how such investigations truly began, not only from defense lawyers, which is totally illegal, but also sometimes from prosecutors and judges.
[00:57:29.722 --> 00:57:31.883]  Yeah, because they haven't been let in on everything yet.
[00:57:32.604 --> 00:57:33.485]  As I told you folks,
[00:57:34.165 --> 00:57:37.266]  I told you most police aren't let in on this, even at the Threat Fusion Centers.
[00:57:37.626 --> 00:57:38.446]  Let me explain.
[00:57:38.806 --> 00:57:45.568]  It goes on to say that once they've already got the data without warrants, they go and create, or recreate, a fake investigation.
[00:57:46.029 --> 00:57:48.889]  What did I tell you about the millions of wiretaps where they do a rubber stamp?
[00:57:49.169 --> 00:57:50.710]  That's only done phase two.
[00:57:51.210 --> 00:57:54.751]  After they've already got the data, they then go recreate the fake investigation.
[00:57:55.291 --> 00:57:57.132]  Now they're just getting rid of that entirely.
[00:57:58.472 --> 00:58:01.233]  And of course, this is all designed to also plant stuff on your computer.
[00:58:02.981 --> 00:58:10.646]  They've planted on over 20,000 Defense Department employees, last time I checked, child porn, and they come in and tell them they planted it, and they better do what they're told now.
[00:58:11.847 --> 00:58:16.550]  Instead of all those people just standing up saying you planted it, they're all going to do what they're told and it's the end of the country.
[00:58:17.511 --> 00:58:19.993]  The updated documents show, how many times have you heard me say this?
[00:58:20.293 --> 00:58:20.613]  Hundreds?
[00:58:22.927 --> 00:58:29.553]  Undated documents show the federal agents are trained to recreate the investigation trail to effectively cover up where the information originated.
[00:58:29.573 --> 00:58:33.657]  A practice that some experts say violates the defendant's constitutional right to a fair trial.
[00:58:34.097 --> 00:58:34.758]  It's not that!
[00:58:34.818 --> 00:58:40.082]  They got the info illegally to begin with and created a fraudulent new investigation!
[00:58:40.102 --> 00:58:48.310]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.

[01:00:38.527 --> 01:00:41.569]  Folks, here's some of the headlines up on InfoWars.com.
[01:00:41.769 --> 01:00:48.314]  Al-Nusra mercenaries in Syria slaughter Kurdish women and children in mass.
[01:00:50.235 --> 01:00:54.758]  That's mainstream news in Europe, but you'll never hear about it here, and that's our government funding that.
[01:00:56.860 --> 01:00:58.881]  And of course, those are groups that aren't even with Assad.
[01:01:00.062 --> 01:01:03.544]  The Al-Qaeda forces are allowed to kill whoever they want, whenever they want.
[01:01:04.245 --> 01:01:05.906]  Back to the days of Lawrence of Arabia.
[01:01:07.526 --> 01:01:10.328]  Fourth Amendment dead in Los Angeles.
[01:01:10.429 --> 01:01:16.214]  Very powerful article by Kurt Nemo that shows this cop just comes over and says, I want to search your car because I feel like it.
[01:01:16.974 --> 01:01:18.556]  And I mean, talk about a power trip.
[01:01:20.958 --> 01:01:22.759]  And then I see this video of this homeless guy.
[01:01:22.779 --> 01:01:23.620]  I'm gonna get to that later.
[01:01:26.803 --> 01:01:30.346]  Where the female cop gets in his face and he calls her the B word reportedly.
[01:01:32.389 --> 01:01:35.571]  And you can see, she just pulls the gun out, sticks it to his chest, and shoots him.
[01:01:36.071 --> 01:01:46.736]  I mean, it's just getting... I mean, like, I saw another one over the weekend, a couple of them, where the guy had a warrant out, and they said his truck didn't stop, so they shot him and his girlfriend.
[01:01:47.748 --> 01:01:57.537]  And it's just now, you know, it's like, it's Rambo tough, because y'all play video games that were designed by the Pentagon, the shoot-em-up games, to where you would kill and, you know, not hesitate up close.
[01:01:58.417 --> 01:02:02.341]  And now more and more it's like really manly, like, ooh, you haven't killed anybody yet on the department?
[01:02:03.882 --> 01:02:07.145]  You better get out there and get your job done, you know, get out there and kill somebody immediately.
[01:02:07.165 --> 01:02:12.630]  And of course those tapes have been released about, you know, the police saying, let's go out and hunt some people, let's kill some people tonight.
[01:02:14.454 --> 01:02:20.276]  And it's like, you know, it's not like you're going out in the forest with another guy that's got a gun and saying, you start here, I start there, let's kill each other.
[01:02:20.296 --> 01:02:23.958]  I mean, if you're into that kind of stuff, why don't you go find somebody like you?
[01:02:24.298 --> 01:02:25.458]  You guys can go kill each other.
[01:02:25.538 --> 01:02:28.499]  Or why don't you go take jujitsu and then start competing?
[01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:34.362]  I mean, just, you know, I mean, if you want to do all that, go do it, but don't do it just on, on the average people.
[01:02:34.902 --> 01:02:36.543]  That is not, that is not tough.
[01:02:36.583 --> 01:02:37.283]  That is pathetic.
[01:02:46.232 --> 01:02:49.033]  And I know a lot of you like to kill people just because it's a game.
[01:02:49.053 --> 01:02:50.794]  You don't necessarily even enjoy killing them.
[01:02:52.034 --> 01:02:55.075]  You like the feeling you get after it of being sad that you killed somebody.
[01:02:57.016 --> 01:02:58.656]  You like to cross that line, don't you?
[01:03:00.657 --> 01:03:14.282]  But see, you've been given the power, authoritarians worldwide, to hurt the innocent and kill people because your masters are killing softly, gently, in a torturous way.
[01:03:15.555 --> 01:03:17.696]  In a slow, grueling, false hope way.
[01:03:18.657 --> 01:03:22.018]  Through the anthropogenic cancer weapons.
[01:03:22.839 --> 01:03:27.782]  The binary chemical systems that have been introduced into the food chain.
[01:03:30.543 --> 01:03:33.265]  And they sit back and they write statistical analysis books.
[01:03:33.885 --> 01:03:36.106]  The White House Science Czar, John B. Holdren and others.
[01:03:37.307 --> 01:03:38.648]  Tracking their progress.
[01:03:39.508 --> 01:03:44.791]  And they have taken very beautiful people across the world, wherever they get control,
[01:03:45.998 --> 01:03:49.880]  And they have made us very, very ugly and stunted and dumb and diseased.
[01:03:50.901 --> 01:03:53.122]  And the truly beautiful are truly rare now.
[01:03:55.244 --> 01:04:01.748]  Beauty in spirit, beauty in looks, beauty in works is the enemy.
[01:04:03.649 --> 01:04:04.590]  It is the feast.
[01:04:06.671 --> 01:04:07.572]  It is the target.
[01:04:09.373 --> 01:04:11.154]  It is the main dish of the night.
[01:04:15.063 --> 01:04:16.344]  They dine on our youth.
[01:04:17.985 --> 01:04:19.546]  They dine on our virtue.
[01:04:19.827 --> 01:04:29.414]  They desecrate and vandalize all that is sacred, all that is holy, all that is wholesome, all that is good.
[01:04:30.334 --> 01:04:31.395]  They trot us underfoot.
[01:04:32.536 --> 01:04:33.757]  They are the priest of power.
[01:04:34.918 --> 01:04:36.559]  Always pressing on the nerve of power.
[01:04:37.319 --> 01:04:39.361]  A society more wicked, more destructive.
[01:04:40.061 --> 01:04:41.302]  That's their progress.
[01:04:41.863 --> 01:04:43.264]  Trampling and being trampled.
[01:04:46.627 --> 01:04:49.874]  I ask you, do you like the fruits of the New World Order?
[01:04:51.778 --> 01:04:54.904]  Because if you do, it's going to get a lot worse.
[01:05:01.727 --> 01:05:06.292]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[01:05:06.452 --> 01:05:09.415]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[01:05:09.575 --> 01:05:14.801]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[01:05:15.121 --> 01:05:16.743]  It all comes down to one thing.
[01:05:17.063 --> 01:05:18.384]  We are what we eat.
[01:05:18.705 --> 01:05:23.029]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[01:05:23.369 --> 01:05:27.353]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[01:05:27.593 --> 01:05:29.915]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[01:05:30.155 --> 01:05:36.081]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[01:08:12.987 --> 01:08:13.988]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:14.548 --> 01:08:18.150]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:18.730 --> 01:08:22.852]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:30.196 --> 01:08:33.798]  China is ending its one-child policy on the surface.
[01:08:33.818 --> 01:08:35.319]  We're gonna look at the implications of that.
[01:08:36.226 --> 01:08:45.008]  They found what the British Empire found, that if you just simply say that you're no longer an empire but continue operating as a corporate entity, people will not resist.
[01:08:45.928 --> 01:08:52.069]  Or if you say an assault is not an assault, they'll lay down while you knock their political and socio-economic teeth out.
[01:08:53.369 --> 01:09:03.871]  Really, through bureaucracy and regulation, they're expanding the social engineering that has a fully 50-plus million boys in China than there are girls.
[01:09:04.744 --> 01:09:06.925]  And that has caused a huge societal crisis.
[01:09:07.405 --> 01:09:11.507]  They're now trying to move forward with similar systems here in the Western world.
[01:09:11.547 --> 01:09:16.030]  So that's coming up after our guest, who's going to pop in, leaves us.
[01:09:17.731 --> 01:09:24.494]  Also, if you just joined us recapping our top story, it really is big news because it's in Reuters and now people can admit it.
[01:09:24.954 --> 01:09:29.256]  But you could go back 15 years ago, I'm not bragging, I'm just pointing out this was public.
[01:09:29.697 --> 01:09:31.458]  This was in the Telecommunications Act of 96, so I guess
[01:09:34.327 --> 01:09:35.368]  How many years ago was 1996?
[01:09:39.069 --> 01:09:39.989]  No, 1996.
[01:09:42.590 --> 01:09:39.989]  1996.
[01:09:42.610 --> 01:09:47.191]  1996.
[01:09:42.670 --> 01:09:47.191]  We're talking 17 years.
[01:09:48.552 --> 01:09:49.552]  Yeah, 17 years.
[01:09:49.572 --> 01:09:55.314]  I always tend to say 15 years because time just keeps flying by.
[01:09:55.354 --> 01:09:57.194]  Hard to believe I've been on air more than 18 years.
[01:09:57.594 --> 01:09:59.315]  They got the Telecommunications Act come out.
[01:10:00.379 --> 01:10:09.687]  And it paid $9 billion to put all these hubs in, and to put the threat fusion centers in, and to wire all of this.
[01:10:09.847 --> 01:10:17.433]  And then all these major companies put out in their stock holding announcements and valuations what's going on.
[01:10:17.813 --> 01:10:22.337]  I mean, Google in 2005 said, we're using cameras and microphones to listen to you in your house.
[01:10:22.717 --> 01:10:28.642]  We have AI computers, store up all the data, and then we run it through an algorithm, and then we decide what ads to pop up.
[01:10:29.653 --> 01:10:33.136]  And of course, CNN last week had the headline, your TV is watching you.
[01:10:34.076 --> 01:10:35.718]  See, now it's time to tell you.
[01:10:36.418 --> 01:10:38.039]  Well, here's another one out of Reuters.
[01:10:38.460 --> 01:10:39.520]  Exclusive U.S.
[01:10:40.161 --> 01:10:48.287]  directs agents to cover up program used to investigate Americans for marijuana, for spanking their kids, just everything.
[01:10:50.166 --> 01:10:53.688]  And it's all in these terminals at the Threat Fusion Centers.
[01:10:53.948 --> 01:10:58.110]  Everything about you, where you're at, they can dial in and find where your phone's at without a warrant.
[01:10:58.510 --> 01:11:01.452]  They can dial in and turn your phone on to listen to you, even when it's off.
[01:11:01.852 --> 01:11:05.714]  They can hard-code messages to your phone, video, text, and audio.
[01:11:06.054 --> 01:11:08.375]  Even when it's off, it reboots it and turns it on.
[01:11:09.936 --> 01:11:14.358]  Most phones even have a capacitor in them, where even if the battery's removed, they can do this.
[01:11:15.313 --> 01:11:16.714]  They can briefly power it up.
[01:11:16.814 --> 01:11:20.856]  I mean, they're hardwiring a technocratic takeover program.
[01:11:21.257 --> 01:11:30.162]  And here's Reuters saying that once they get data for a prosecution without warrants, they go recreate the investigation, open up and get the warrant, and it's totally illegal.
[01:11:30.882 --> 01:11:31.202]  Boom.
[01:11:31.342 --> 01:11:31.722]  Reuters.
[01:11:32.243 --> 01:11:35.184]  FBI pressures internet providers to install surveillance software.
[01:11:35.444 --> 01:11:37.804]  Yeah, that's the Cyber Security Act they can't pass.
[01:11:38.665 --> 01:11:50.129]  So now they're just going even into small IT companies with a hundred or more customers and threatening them to pay themselves to put the snooping systems in and the fiber optic back to FBI.
[01:11:54.932 --> 01:11:55.873]  I mean beyond 1984.
[01:11:56.313 --> 01:11:56.913]  Here it is.
[01:11:57.293 --> 01:12:00.574]  NSA secretly feeding spy intel to police for petty crimes.
[01:12:00.675 --> 01:12:01.055]  Boom!
[01:12:01.595 --> 01:12:08.478]  Feds are suspects in new malware that attacks Tor anonymity.
[01:12:09.578 --> 01:12:12.679]  And they're loading it onto the servers of the companies.
[01:12:12.879 --> 01:12:14.100]  This is Wired Magazine.
[01:12:14.540 --> 01:12:16.901]  When you want to try to have your legal, lawful privacy,
[01:12:18.871 --> 01:12:22.214]  They are going, and with their cyber command, hacking in and loading and on.
[01:12:22.514 --> 01:12:34.703]  Google, on record, that's why they didn't get in trouble here, uses their wireless cars to go around with government codes given to them by Microsoft, Apple, and everybody else to break into your computer and download everything, including your codes.
[01:12:36.175 --> 01:12:37.336]  I told you that a decade ago.
[01:12:37.396 --> 01:12:38.157]  It's on record now.
[01:12:38.858 --> 01:12:40.380]  Because I have NSA sources.
[01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:41.922]  I have FBI sources.
[01:12:42.643 --> 01:12:43.984]  People say the sources have dried up.
[01:12:44.525 --> 01:12:55.278]  We just broke with our sources through defense contractors and the Intel Hub and others that don't want to be named, more of the urban warfare centers they've got where they are trading to take on the American people yesterday.
[01:12:57.369 --> 01:13:01.431]  The answer to this tyranny is more whistle-blowing, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:13:01.971 --> 01:13:04.212]  If something's illegal, you have a duty to do it.
[01:13:04.592 --> 01:13:08.034]  Now, we're going to our guest here, who I appreciate joining us today.
[01:13:08.094 --> 01:13:09.114]  He's Brandon Toye.
[01:13:10.695 --> 01:13:14.697]  And a few weeks ago, his resignation letter went viral.
[01:13:14.797 --> 01:13:15.797]  Millions read it.
[01:13:16.358 --> 01:13:20.640]  Military veteran himself, former U.S.
[01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:25.342]  soldier who served in Baghdad and Sadr City neighborhoods as a military policeman,
[01:13:26.659 --> 01:13:32.064]  He was a Humvee machine gunner who trained and supported Iraqi personnel and Iraqi policemen.
[01:13:32.565 --> 01:13:37.589]  He later joined General Dynamics as an engineer project manager for developmental engineering projects.
[01:13:37.629 --> 01:13:40.392]  General Dynamics, one of the largest defense contractors in the country.
[01:13:40.832 --> 01:13:44.956]  He recently resigned in protest of America's dirty wars, close quote.
[01:13:45.677 --> 01:13:48.859]  We've crossed the line and done things that I thought our enemies did.
[01:13:50.171 --> 01:13:56.654]  And further states, I have always believed in every foot soldier threw down his rifle, war would end.
[01:13:57.074 --> 01:13:58.455]  I hereby throw mine down.
[01:13:58.795 --> 01:14:01.636]  Here's what I wanted to get Brandon a toy on.
[01:14:01.656 --> 01:14:04.777]  We have his resignation letter just went up on Infowars.com.
[01:14:05.057 --> 01:14:10.360]  I'm going to have it put back in the features so everybody can go read that.
[01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:12.761]  But the issue here
[01:14:14.281 --> 01:14:23.133]  Is that that's why they want to go to the drones and autonomous ground robots and basically looks like a tank that's autonomous and operates on its own, a hunter seeker.
[01:14:24.054 --> 01:14:26.017]  I was a Marine Corps Colonel.
[01:14:28.468 --> 01:14:45.820]  In 1999, contacted me, well, I met him out in California at some urban events they were having, and, well, I met a contact who got me in touch with him, and then I met him, and he said, look, I can't tell you all the classified stuff, but the plan is by 2020 to be 100% human free.
[01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:50.963]  He goes, I don't know if they're gonna reach that goal, but he goes, it's basically Skynet.
[01:14:51.223 --> 01:14:53.124]  Well, and I've been telling you that since 1998, 1999, I guess it was 99.
[01:14:55.703 --> 01:14:56.644]  Operation Urban Warrior.
[01:14:57.204 --> 01:14:58.946]  And now you see all that being announced.
[01:14:58.966 --> 01:15:02.709]  So understand that they know humans aren't going to go along with this.
[01:15:02.749 --> 01:15:05.312]  That's why the Foxconn factories are going to robots.
[01:15:06.232 --> 01:15:08.214]  They've ordered, was it 15 million of them?
[01:15:08.895 --> 01:15:09.836]  5 million already got delivered.
[01:15:09.856 --> 01:15:11.898]  They're just telling the folks, go out and die in the street.
[01:15:12.478 --> 01:15:14.820]  They chain their kids up to go to work in the morning to the power poles.
[01:15:15.781 --> 01:15:17.743]  How are we going to compete with Obamacare against that?
[01:15:18.747 --> 01:15:22.252]  And again, it's not computers as part of a normal evolution of technology.
[01:15:22.312 --> 01:15:31.123]  It's being done to make us obsolete, as Bill Joy, the head of Sun Microsystems, wrote in Why the Future Doesn't Need Us, April issue 2000 of Wired Magazine.
[01:15:34.013 --> 01:15:53.437]  So I want to explain, it's now time for the whistleblowing, it's now time to not go along with these illegal wars, it's now time to say no, because if we get much further down this road, another 6, 7, 8 years, they're a little bit behind, maybe 10 years, it's going to get harder and harder folks, where it's not going to, that's why they're already ruining the military with women in front line combat and all that.
[01:15:54.448 --> 01:15:57.109]  Because it's time to ruin it anyways and make it dysfunctional.
[01:15:57.529 --> 01:15:58.950]  Humans have free will.
[01:15:59.070 --> 01:15:59.830]  They don't want that.
[01:16:00.651 --> 01:16:02.672]  Thank you, sir, Brandon Toye, for joining us.
[01:16:03.612 --> 01:16:05.613]  Tell us about your experience in Iraq.
[01:16:06.033 --> 01:16:06.774]  I don't have it in your bio.
[01:16:06.814 --> 01:16:07.914]  Are you Army or Marines?
[01:16:07.974 --> 01:16:08.214]  Yes.
[01:16:08.774 --> 01:16:11.496]  And just a little bit about your awakening and your letter.
[01:16:12.636 --> 01:16:14.197]  I really appreciate your courage in coming on.
[01:16:15.098 --> 01:16:16.439]  Thanks Alex, thanks for having me on.
[01:16:17.199 --> 01:16:20.061]  Yeah, I spent 2005 in Baghdad on the east side.
[01:16:20.081 --> 01:16:35.029]  I was stationed at Camp Rastamaya and I was a machine gunner, as you said, and our mission was to train combat troops, Iraqi policemen and Iraqi National Guard to basically take over was the plan.
[01:16:36.930 --> 01:16:41.253]  I spent the entire year there, came back, went to school, started to work for General Dynamics.
[01:16:41.273 --> 01:16:45.317]  It was an easy transition, of course, going from the military to a defense contractor.
[01:16:45.517 --> 01:16:50.861]  And even in Iraq, I started to realize that this wasn't exactly what I signed up for.
[01:16:51.741 --> 01:17:03.790]  And when I got home, you know, there's a lot of journalists, whistleblowers, activists who have come out with evidence of criminal actions by the United States military that I became aware of.
[01:17:04.931 --> 01:17:08.333]  And I just, I couldn't be a part of it anymore, Alex.
[01:17:08.353 --> 01:17:17.518]  The last straw for me was when The Guardian and BBC Arabic came out with the expose on Colonel Steele's Dirty Wars in Iraq.
[01:17:17.558 --> 01:17:26.924]  And I realized that when I was training Iraqi soldiers and Iraqi military policemen, that I was actually training death squads and torture units.
[01:17:28.484 --> 01:17:32.348]  Now, I've got a partial bio in here, and I read your letter last week.
[01:17:32.368 --> 01:17:33.669]  Were you in the Army or the Marines?
[01:17:34.189 --> 01:17:34.309]  Army.
[01:17:34.349 --> 01:17:35.250]  You were in the Army?
[01:17:35.811 --> 01:17:45.139]  And for those that don't know, there's been admitted death squads at least since Vietnam, and I even remember they used some Latin American former death squads in Iraq.
[01:17:45.179 --> 01:17:46.700]  That came out in the news a few years ago.
[01:17:47.801 --> 01:17:52.985]  And now they've announced under NDAA that they're establishing paramilitary secret death squad groups.
[01:17:53.485 --> 01:17:55.486]  I happen to know those were already in the U.S.
[01:17:55.546 --> 01:18:03.752]  previously with sheep-dipped arming officers because I had a family member, a great-uncle, who was actually involved in that even back in the 70s and 80s.
[01:18:04.312 --> 01:18:08.235]  Tell us about these death squads and what you saw being established.
[01:18:09.349 --> 01:18:13.233]  Well, when I was on the ground, I didn't really know that we were training death squads.
[01:18:13.293 --> 01:18:24.365]  I knew that the forces had been infiltrated by the Shia militias, but I didn't know any torture or murdering was going on, aside from what I saw in the streets.
[01:18:25.185 --> 01:18:27.308]  It wasn't until I came back that I became aware of it.
[01:18:28.729 --> 01:18:40.620]  I saw my time overseas as my shining moment in my life and to come to the realization that I was participating in war crimes, that big of war crimes, was devastating.
[01:18:43.522 --> 01:18:46.025]  Talk about what constitutes a war crime.
[01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:51.063]  Um, I think torture is a war crime.
[01:18:51.444 --> 01:18:56.489]  Murder, invasion, a war of aggression is a war crime.
[01:18:56.509 --> 01:19:00.613]  I think, you know, there's lots of war crimes.
[01:19:00.633 --> 01:19:01.975]  You can find lots of examples.
[01:19:04.071 --> 01:19:07.693]  Absolutely, and it's a crime against humanity what's been done to Iraq.
[01:19:07.733 --> 01:19:19.839]  The Lancet Medical Journal estimated just a few years ago there was over a million dead Iraqis because of the consequences of the war, and around a half million before that from the sanctions alone.
[01:19:20.740 --> 01:19:29.785]  Unbelievable, and I tell you, the way the universe works, in my gut, I know, just for Americans allowing ourselves to be part of this, this is going to come back on all of us.
[01:19:30.876 --> 01:19:31.677]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:19:31.717 --> 01:19:34.540]  You can't take these kind of actions and not expect retribution.
[01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:40.986]  The things that our government is doing in our name right now are criminal, and there will be retribution down the road.
[01:19:41.847 --> 01:19:47.412]  Well, I agree there'll be some real organic asymmetrical resistance, but I'm talking about just the way the world seems to work.
[01:19:48.534 --> 01:19:52.538]  The retribution will be this evil will be done to us by our government here as well.
[01:19:53.527 --> 01:19:59.536]  Yeah, that thought terrifies me, but it seems to be heading in that direction, Alex, and that's very scary.
[01:19:59.837 --> 01:20:04.584]  Why did you decide to resign from the defense contractor you were working for?
[01:20:04.624 --> 01:20:05.826]  I mean, I guess to make your stand.
[01:20:05.886 --> 01:20:06.708]  Tell us about your letter.
[01:20:07.972 --> 01:20:08.472]  Yeah, sure.
[01:20:08.913 --> 01:20:12.696]  After that expose came out that I spoke about earlier, I sat down and I wrote that letter.
[01:20:12.716 --> 01:20:14.577]  I was just irate for about five days.
[01:20:14.637 --> 01:20:15.238]  I didn't sleep.
[01:20:15.958 --> 01:20:17.380]  My wife thought I was going crazy.
[01:20:18.060 --> 01:20:20.042]  And I wrote the letter and I said, this is it.
[01:20:20.182 --> 01:20:20.922]  I'm getting out of here.
[01:20:21.903 --> 01:20:27.868]  I no longer saw a line between being on the front lines, holding a rifle over theater, and working for the same people back home.
[01:20:27.908 --> 01:20:32.992]  Whether I was typing a benign report, managing a project, whatever.
[01:20:33.032 --> 01:20:35.414]  I was still working in the same power structure.
[01:20:36.014 --> 01:20:37.175]  I didn't want to do it anymore.
[01:20:37.395 --> 01:20:45.019]  I thought and I felt one thing, but my actions completely betrayed me and, in my opinion, my own country.
[01:20:45.399 --> 01:20:47.840]  So I finally just, I had enough.
[01:20:47.900 --> 01:20:50.481]  I said, listen, I want to have my voice heard.
[01:20:50.982 --> 01:20:51.862]  I want to make a statement.
[01:20:51.882 --> 01:20:53.643]  I've been working 10 years for these guys.
[01:20:54.083 --> 01:20:55.304]  I don't believe in it anymore.
[01:20:55.504 --> 01:21:00.847]  In fact, I believe that these actions are criminal and the things that we're doing are illegal.
[01:21:02.307 --> 01:21:08.252]  I want to come out very publicly and say that I'm not a part of it anymore and that's why I wrote the letter.
[01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:20.327]  Just recently we've seen a lot of public suicide letters where they say, different Army and Marines say, I've committed so many murderous crimes that there's no way for me to even apologize and try to reverse it.
[01:21:20.347 --> 01:21:21.307]  I'm just going to kill myself.
[01:21:21.648 --> 01:21:27.051]  I wish they would do what you've done and just speak out and then try to reverse it that way and not kill themselves.
[01:21:27.311 --> 01:21:30.313]  That only adds one more casualty to this madness.
[01:21:30.353 --> 01:21:33.154]  God can always reprieve us even if we don't believe in God.
[01:21:33.194 --> 01:21:37.217]  It's always possible in the works you do in this world to try to reverse some of what
[01:21:37.817 --> 01:21:57.227]  People been part of plus people get lied to and sucked in it's easy to look in hindsight You know and say oh these people are evil, but it's incremental It's peer pressure, but when I read about these suicide letters, and then I see somebody like private Gruckheimer who back in 2003 was in the Ithaca Journal and then on Fox News
[01:21:58.067 --> 01:22:01.408]  He said, oh, we go in and kill entire villages because they're bad people.
[01:22:02.168 --> 01:22:03.989]  We kill the men, women, and children.
[01:22:04.329 --> 01:22:07.350]  And then the Pentagon clarified, well, only certain villages.
[01:22:07.730 --> 01:22:12.472]  And for those that don't know, why don't you describe the type of things that go on?
[01:22:12.512 --> 01:22:23.115]  Because it's been confirmed by General Togumbo's own report of the army, of what went on at Abu Ghraib and other facilities, including the rape of children sanctioned in front of their parents.
[01:22:23.175 --> 01:22:25.396]  I mean, that is hell-raiser type stuff.
[01:22:26.147 --> 01:22:27.108]  That's despicable.
[01:22:27.168 --> 01:22:30.990]  That is right up there on the level of Nazism.
[01:22:32.751 --> 01:22:34.172]  All kinds of bad things happen.
[01:22:34.192 --> 01:22:36.453]  It's unfortunate that the American people don't see more of it.
[01:22:36.493 --> 01:22:40.975]  The mainstream media basically ignores the entire affair.
[01:22:41.256 --> 01:22:45.658]  If you didn't pay attention to alternate news, would you even know the Afghanistan war was going on anymore?
[01:22:45.718 --> 01:22:50.661]  I've asked certain people, talked to certain people about Afghanistan, and they said, I don't even know we were at war there anymore.
[01:22:51.802 --> 01:22:54.043]  The one thing that really bothers me is drone warfare.
[01:22:54.704 --> 01:23:06.374]  In particular, the December 17, 2009 attack in Yemen that killed around 40-plus people, a dozen or so children, at least a dozen pregnant women.
[01:23:07.934 --> 01:23:10.055]  These things happen on a daily basis.
[01:23:10.395 --> 01:23:11.436]  They're substantiated.
[01:23:11.496 --> 01:23:15.657]  There's scientific reports from independent third parties out.
[01:23:15.697 --> 01:23:16.677]  You can go read about them.
[01:23:17.137 --> 01:23:18.358]  That information's out there.
[01:23:18.398 --> 01:23:19.938]  These things are documented.
[01:23:19.958 --> 01:23:20.339]  Sure.
[01:23:20.499 --> 01:23:21.299]  They're taking place.
[01:23:21.799 --> 01:23:22.859]  Well, I mean, here's my issue.
[01:23:22.879 --> 01:23:24.400]  There's going to be problems in war.
[01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:25.600]  There's going to be casualties.
[01:23:25.940 --> 01:23:32.363]  But when you get to the attitude of none of it matters and then reward kind of a psychopathic behavior, you know you're in trouble.
[01:23:32.383 --> 01:23:34.263]  And that's being consciously done.
[01:23:34.303 --> 01:23:36.064]  We've been led to these wars via lies.
[01:23:36.924 --> 01:23:40.029]  And now I see this being brought back domestically.
[01:23:40.791 --> 01:23:44.577]  That's my point about this will come back on us one way or the other.
[01:23:44.857 --> 01:23:47.982]  Every day I see police now who are generally war vets.
[01:23:48.957 --> 01:23:52.058]  Shooting people that just mildly talk back to them.
[01:23:52.618 --> 01:23:58.760]  And of course I know from the vets I've talked to, that was part and parcel of behavior in Afghanistan and Iraq.
[01:23:59.060 --> 01:24:00.421]  What is the Pentagon thinking?
[01:24:00.801 --> 01:24:04.922]  That alone, acting like that, will make you lose the hearts and minds.
[01:24:05.182 --> 01:24:10.224]  So it's clearly a madness that I see going on from the top down.
[01:24:10.264 --> 01:24:11.124]  Can you speak to that?
[01:24:12.011 --> 01:24:29.087]  Yeah, I think that the actions that we allow our government and military to take overseas, if we allow them to dehumanize people overseas, treat them as less than human, commit war crimes against them, it's only a matter of time before they, as you say, bring that back home and start using those tactics back home.
[01:24:29.327 --> 01:24:31.309]  I think we're already seeing it with the mass surveillance.
[01:24:32.470 --> 01:24:34.772]  Which is totally illegal, but they're just doing it.
[01:24:37.034 --> 01:24:45.541]  What does your wife and family say when you are about to give up an extremely lucrative long-term career working for one of the biggest defense contractors in the world?
[01:24:45.561 --> 01:24:49.324]  Are they supporting your stance?
[01:24:50.835 --> 01:24:52.236]  They've been very supportive.
[01:24:52.296 --> 01:24:54.338]  Everybody has been overwhelmingly supportive.
[01:24:54.458 --> 01:24:56.699]  My family's obviously worried about how I'm going to make a living.
[01:24:56.779 --> 01:24:57.620]  I have four kids.
[01:24:57.640 --> 01:24:58.200]  I'm married.
[01:24:59.902 --> 01:25:01.203]  I'm concerned about that too.
[01:25:01.583 --> 01:25:06.246]  However, I wanted to get my voice out there.
[01:25:06.346 --> 01:25:07.767]  I wanted to make this stand.
[01:25:07.787 --> 01:25:18.375]  It was more important to me to make the stand than to have that security and those financial benefits that came along with going along and giving consent to their actions.
[01:25:18.755 --> 01:25:23.000]  Was it a process or was it watching the persecution of Snowden or Bradley Manning?
[01:25:23.281 --> 01:25:29.588]  I mean, what finally made you go into the thought process of getting out of your main career field?
[01:25:30.498 --> 01:25:32.079]  No, it was absolutely a process.
[01:25:32.899 --> 01:25:35.680]  I started to become more and more aware of the things that were happening.
[01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:40.401]  Back when I enlisted, I was completely brainwashed, you could say.
[01:25:40.421 --> 01:25:42.262]  I went along with it.
[01:25:42.342 --> 01:25:45.463]  I thought the military was the greatest thing in the world.
[01:25:46.083 --> 01:25:47.703]  I went along with the invasion of Iraq.
[01:25:47.763 --> 01:25:49.404]  I was a cheerleader for it, basically.
[01:25:50.204 --> 01:25:54.766]  And over time I started to see things that didn't sit quite right with me.
[01:25:54.786 --> 01:26:10.132]  And when I looked into it more, and maybe it was just a process of maturing, but when hard evidence came out, especially the stuff that Bradley Manning made known to the world, and then Edward Snowden, and the writing of Glenn Greenwald, and many other people,
[01:26:10.912 --> 01:26:20.121]  Uh, the more and more aware of it, I became, the more and more divided I became inside between who I really was and what I was doing, what my actions were.
[01:26:20.201 --> 01:26:25.066]  So there was that classic battle of the devil on one shoulder, the angel on the other, and the angel won out.
[01:26:25.927 --> 01:26:27.629]  The angel did win out, thankfully.
[01:26:28.867 --> 01:26:31.688]  Let me ask you this question, because I've gone through this myself on other issues.
[01:26:31.728 --> 01:26:37.230]  When I turn down a big contract to sell out, or I go through something that's really when I'm being threatened.
[01:26:38.530 --> 01:26:51.614]  It's almost like once you go through the fear of the other side, did it feel like a giant weight was lifted off of you when you fired that letter out and then saw the validation of people resonating with it and you becoming an example for others?
[01:26:52.234 --> 01:26:56.796]  Clearly, I would imagine the scheme of things reversing massively some of the bad you've done.
[01:26:57.860 --> 01:26:58.660]  It felt wonderful.
[01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:04.482]  I'll tell you, the place I worked, General Dynamics, main headquarters is located on Mound Road.
[01:27:04.522 --> 01:27:05.583]  It's a six-lane highway.
[01:27:06.083 --> 01:27:15.526]  I went out to lunch that Monday before I shot off my letter and I drove back and forth and I was listening to music, just dreading going back because I dreaded going there all the time.
[01:27:16.126 --> 01:27:17.687]  And I just made this decision.
[01:27:17.747 --> 01:27:18.387]  This is right.
[01:27:18.427 --> 01:27:20.088]  It felt 100% right.
[01:27:20.448 --> 01:27:23.329]  The only reason I wasn't doing it was exactly what you said.
[01:27:23.789 --> 01:27:27.351]  Fear of the unknown, the uncertainty, you know, how am I going to make a living?
[01:27:27.391 --> 01:27:28.672]  How am I going to support my family?
[01:27:28.712 --> 01:27:32.955]  But once I made that decision, I just, I felt very right inside.
[01:27:33.035 --> 01:27:34.956]  I felt it was completely the right thing to do.
[01:27:35.416 --> 01:27:37.357]  Now, you asked me about when I hit the send button.
[01:27:37.377 --> 01:27:43.101]  I'll tell you, that was a moment that was very similar to when I signed my enlistment papers, which is interesting.
[01:27:43.121 --> 01:27:44.642]  You know, I signed my enlistment papers.
[01:27:44.682 --> 01:27:46.303]  I said, there's no coming back from this.
[01:27:46.363 --> 01:27:47.023]  You're doing this.
[01:27:47.063 --> 01:27:48.004]  You signed this paper.
[01:27:48.044 --> 01:27:48.984]  There's no turning back.
[01:27:49.044 --> 01:27:51.546]  When I hit that send button, I had the same feeling.
[01:27:52.523 --> 01:27:58.669]  But this time he really did join the human family and the Republic for the fight for the heart and soul of humanity that's happening right now.
[01:27:58.749 --> 01:27:59.810]  And that's what's happening.
[01:27:59.830 --> 01:28:08.178]  I don't know if you're a spiritual person, but at a spiritual level, and I've never really had a spiritual show, but more and more I see people are making their decision right now.
[01:28:08.558 --> 01:28:11.081]  People are getting on which side they're on.
[01:28:11.681 --> 01:28:17.186]  And I just feel sorry for people that are choosing the wrong side or via peer pressure, but this empire we've become,
[01:28:18.227 --> 01:28:19.248]  It needs to stop.
[01:28:19.268 --> 01:28:24.652]  And then they're funding Al-Qaeda, so they have a threat to then have the NSA spy on us?
[01:28:25.133 --> 01:28:27.955]  I mean, it's just, the whole narrative is falling apart.
[01:28:28.896 --> 01:28:34.140]  It's absolutely disgusting the things they do to justify their illegal and criminal actions.
[01:28:35.401 --> 01:28:44.308]  The Patriot Act, the name alone should tell you that that's something that we need to be absolutely infuriated by and afraid of.
[01:28:44.848 --> 01:28:45.189]  Exactly.
[01:28:59.702 --> 01:29:07.750]  Well, this republic, it is criminal, was founded on ideas, even though we never implemented them all, about don't have spying, have a small government, individual liberty.
[01:29:08.150 --> 01:29:16.037]  Now, all these senators like Graham and others get up there and say, we've got to spy on you without warrants for your own good, you know, to defend freedom.
[01:29:16.718 --> 01:29:21.161]  When they're butchering what America stands for in front of us, they are the traitors.
[01:29:21.201 --> 01:29:23.763]  I want to come back and talk about how you're taking action.
[01:29:23.783 --> 01:29:30.047]  You're not just going to resign and not, you know, help build the Skynet system that's going to replace humanity, basically.
[01:29:30.367 --> 01:29:31.428]  That's the globalist plan.
[01:29:31.888 --> 01:29:34.350]  You are also going to get on the offense
[01:29:34.730 --> 01:29:42.752]  For our Bill of Rights and Constitution and what Brandon Toy, Army Police Veteran of Iraq, is doing is the answer.
[01:29:42.792 --> 01:29:47.613]  Do not commit suicide because of guilt you have because you have a conscience.
[01:29:47.973 --> 01:29:48.993]  That means you're human.
[01:29:49.053 --> 01:29:51.053]  We need you to fight for humanity.
[01:29:51.093 --> 01:29:51.934]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.434 --> 01:29:54.034]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.954 --> 01:29:57.635]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:31:02.128 --> 01:31:04.890]  Protecting your home with a security system is a must.
[01:31:05.130 --> 01:31:11.155]  But when it comes to protecting your family, your home, and belongings, there's no need to sign a long-term contract.
[01:31:11.515 --> 01:31:17.900]  Listen, there is some real scum in the alarm business cashing in by locking you into long, punishing contracts.
[01:31:18.300 --> 01:31:20.261]  Not with SimpliSafe Home Security.
[01:31:20.602 --> 01:31:21.642]  They're the good guys.

[01:32:01.547 --> 01:32:06.128]  There is a false sense of security that the greatest economic crash since the Great Depression is over.
[01:32:06.208 --> 01:32:12.069]  But unemployment is still at a 20-year high, and until Americans are working again, the economy has not recovered.
[01:32:12.169 --> 01:32:13.929]  What is the smartest investment you can make?
[01:32:14.089 --> 01:32:14.570]  It's food.
[01:32:14.730 --> 01:32:21.551]  Having a supply of eFoodsDirect 25-year shelf life food is your best investment for the troubled times today and the future.

[01:32:41.889 --> 01:32:42.149]  I think so.
[01:33:18.118 --> 01:33:22.020]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:23.401 --> 01:33:26.023]  That's right, from the InfoWars.com studios.
[01:33:27.103 --> 01:33:39.511]  I'm going to spend a few more minutes with Brandon Toy, and then we're going to get into some of the other news, and open the phones up, and Catherine Albrecht's going to be joining us on all the huge coming out of the NSA surveillance grid news that's coming out.
[01:33:39.611 --> 01:33:42.573]  Google, you name it, she's going to be joining us.
[01:33:43.533 --> 01:33:45.275]  You know, Catherine, I've heard her on the air.
[01:33:45.655 --> 01:33:46.957]  She's here on the Genesis Network.
[01:33:46.997 --> 01:33:50.861]  I've heard her talk about getting up to stage 3, almost stage 4 cancer.
[01:33:50.881 --> 01:33:52.083]  They were debating which it was.
[01:33:52.844 --> 01:33:55.767]  And thanks to the good Lord above beating it.
[01:33:56.288 --> 01:33:57.749]  And it's in total remission right now.
[01:33:59.591 --> 01:34:01.412]  That made her not be worldly anymore.
[01:34:01.452 --> 01:34:02.952]  That made her not be vain anymore.
[01:34:03.012 --> 01:34:08.895]  Not that she ever was that much, but it really focused her to realize what's real and what isn't.
[01:34:08.955 --> 01:34:11.217]  What matters versus what doesn't.
[01:34:11.237 --> 01:34:12.637]  What matters is being good.
[01:34:13.158 --> 01:34:20.701]  What matters is being informed and not being a slave and not buying into the sick hype that is American culture today.
[01:34:20.742 --> 01:34:23.043]  This is the opposite of what this country was founded on.
[01:34:24.191 --> 01:34:29.375]  And it is going to be good men and women taking action and speaking out against corruption everywhere.
[01:34:30.676 --> 01:34:38.482]  Not the diversions of MSNBC that is going to save this society or the diversions of CNN or Fox for that matter.
[01:34:39.923 --> 01:34:46.188]  It is going to be about really historically looking where we are right now compared to other nations that have done similar things.
[01:34:46.969 --> 01:34:50.752]  Every other country in history that did what we're doing we called evil.
[01:34:53.248 --> 01:34:57.931]  All our history books, our textbooks, our common sense, this is what the bad guys do.
[01:34:58.131 --> 01:35:02.713]  You read the Bible, everything in the Old Testament, New Testament, the corrupt empires did, we do it now.
[01:35:04.394 --> 01:35:08.836]  And of course the chickens are coming home to roost, of course they're taking the private and public pension funds now.
[01:35:09.477 --> 01:35:13.639]  There's not going to be anything left soon, just like Ross Perot warned about NAFTA and GATT.
[01:35:14.667 --> 01:35:16.709]  These are all selectively written for insiders.
[01:35:17.429 --> 01:35:21.052]  There's not going to be a defense contractor job in just 10 years or so.
[01:35:21.112 --> 01:35:28.057]  It's going to be a handful of what there was because it's going to be robots, building robots, building robots, servicing robots.
[01:35:28.518 --> 01:35:32.141]  Most engineers I talk to now say no one even knows how all this stuff works.
[01:35:32.761 --> 01:35:34.482]  Not one person, not 20 people.
[01:35:34.743 --> 01:35:36.624]  The computers, the programs do.
[01:35:36.944 --> 01:35:39.867]  It's already in the algorithms surpassed us.
[01:35:42.223 --> 01:35:46.284]  And people like Ray Kurzweil are toddling forward going, I'm gonna live forever!
[01:35:46.304 --> 01:35:47.544]  I don't believe in God yet!
[01:35:47.904 --> 01:35:48.784]  I will be God!
[01:35:48.804 --> 01:35:50.665]  I will merge with the machines!
[01:35:52.205 --> 01:35:54.166]  We'll squash the rest of you like a bug!
[01:35:54.186 --> 01:35:55.046]  You won't even count!
[01:35:55.286 --> 01:35:56.546]  We won't even think about you!
[01:35:56.586 --> 01:35:57.206]  That's a quote.
[01:35:57.986 --> 01:35:58.967]  Will we get rid of you?
[01:35:59.787 --> 01:36:01.867]  Just like I step on a bug and don't notice it.
[01:36:03.388 --> 01:36:05.428]  As if we're just gonna let them decide our future.
[01:36:05.768 --> 01:36:08.169]  As if they're even right about what's gonna come out of this.
[01:36:08.449 --> 01:36:09.449]  That's a question right there.
[01:36:11.567 --> 01:36:15.088]  The best-laid plans of mice and men often go astray.
[01:36:16.849 --> 01:36:19.250]  We have a Brandon Toye on with us.
[01:36:19.370 --> 01:36:26.153]  He's served in Iraq and some of the most out-of-control areas as a military policeman in the Army.
[01:36:27.153 --> 01:36:39.558]  And he, I guess a few years after being there, working in the private sector as a defense contractor, just couldn't handle it and resigned a few weeks ago in his resignation letter that's up on Infowars.com.
[01:36:41.033 --> 01:36:42.614]  That's been added to the featured area, right?
[01:36:42.634 --> 01:36:43.375]  We tell them to do that?
[01:36:44.435 --> 01:36:45.036]  Roger, Roger.
[01:36:46.096 --> 01:36:46.717]  Fantastic.
[01:36:47.898 --> 01:36:52.161]  And so everybody needs to get that and send that back out to everyone so you can see what the real soldiers are saying.
[01:36:52.821 --> 01:36:55.343]  And of course Pat Tillman started saying stuff like this and they killed him.
[01:36:56.684 --> 01:36:59.666]  And even gave you a nice story about how he charged a machine gun nest of Al Qaeda.
[01:36:59.906 --> 01:37:01.607]  Turned out it was friendly fire on purpose.
[01:37:02.067 --> 01:37:08.992]  And the Air Force coroner who they had do the Army autopsy there at the base said this was homicide.
[01:37:11.909 --> 01:37:19.953]  It was another Air Force coroner, it was also an Army coroner who was involved, secondarily said the same thing, who said that Ron Brown, the Commerce Secretary, was shot in the head.
[01:37:20.673 --> 01:37:23.895]  There's a lot of good people that won't lie for the system.
[01:37:23.915 --> 01:37:31.879]  And let me tell you something folks, it's those men and women that are in government, corporations, private life, that are holding back the total evil coming in.
[01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:34.600]  That's how history works.
[01:37:34.680 --> 01:37:45.525]  Good men do nothing, good men stand down, good men serve evil because of lies, and all hell breaks loose because then every secret demon in the bad people is now in control.
[01:37:46.145 --> 01:37:47.286]  No one's there to block them.
[01:37:47.546 --> 01:37:48.966]  No one's there to say no.
[01:37:51.727 --> 01:37:54.308]  Because you're beating over the head with 21st century propaganda.
[01:37:54.628 --> 01:37:57.270]  But Brandon Toye understands the info war.
[01:37:58.110 --> 01:38:00.231]  And that's why he is going to become a filmmaker
[01:38:01.072 --> 01:38:04.135]  And it's doing a Kickstarter program, and I'm not involved in this, but I think it's a great idea.
[01:38:04.155 --> 01:38:05.096]  That's why we're having him on.
[01:38:05.456 --> 01:38:06.978]  It's like we had the Paul Revere contest.
[01:38:08.601 --> 01:38:15.123]  Because it's about getting you to become filmmakers, you to become radio bloggers, you to become writers, you to report on what's happening in your area.
[01:38:15.543 --> 01:38:24.666]  Doesn't mean you're perfect, doesn't mean you have all the answers, but you have a good heart, you want to do good, you've got to take action, and together we will beat this technocratic takeover.
[01:38:25.086 --> 01:38:26.987]  So Brandon, tell us about your Kickstarter program.
[01:38:27.007 --> 01:38:29.448]  I love the name of the film you want to produce.
[01:38:30.288 --> 01:38:36.090]  It's More Human Than Human, and then we'll put it back up on screen, I'll give them the full headline, Less Than Human.
[01:38:36.770 --> 01:38:40.652]  Again, more human than human slash less than human.
[01:38:40.972 --> 01:38:43.813]  Brandon Toye, tell us about the film idea you've got.
[01:38:44.773 --> 01:38:45.293]  Sure, Alex.
[01:38:45.393 --> 01:38:47.494]  Actually, it's more than human less than human.
[01:38:48.174 --> 01:38:52.636]  And you can check out more information at morelesshuman.com.
[01:38:52.656 --> 01:38:54.837]  That'll redirect you to the Kickstarter project.
[01:38:54.857 --> 01:38:59.238]  Yeah, let's put that back on screen for folks, if they're TV viewers, and I'll give it out again for folks.
[01:38:59.278 --> 01:39:04.540]  I was reading from the bottom of the screen, more than human forward slash less than human.
[01:39:04.580 --> 01:39:05.201]  What does that mean?
[01:39:06.181 --> 01:39:17.769]  That means, basically, I want to look at the causes and consequences of viewing certain populations, certain people as less than human and other populations as more than human.
[01:39:18.130 --> 01:39:29.578]  Why do we violate the natural rights, the human rights, the civil rights of some people and view it as all right and other people we would never do that same thing to?
[01:39:29.938 --> 01:39:34.119]  For example, consider the reverse of a drone strike in Yemen.
[01:39:35.119 --> 01:39:39.040]  Imagine that we committed a drone strike in Manhattan.
[01:39:39.340 --> 01:39:41.040]  We take an extreme example.
[01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:51.182]  The new Al-Qaeda head was hiding out in Manhattan and the CIA decided that it was easier to drop a drone in there and they killed a bunch of civilians.
[01:39:51.222 --> 01:39:53.043]  We would never accept something like that.
[01:39:53.643 --> 01:39:59.584]  But we'll accept it if it happens in Yemen or Pakistan or another Middle Eastern country that we're not even at war with.
[01:39:59.918 --> 01:40:04.379]  And it's not even because they're, quote, brown, because they're bombing areas that have, quote, white people in them.
[01:40:04.639 --> 01:40:08.540]  It's because the media has said it's okay because they're all terrorists.
[01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:09.861]  Exactly.
[01:40:09.921 --> 01:40:21.023]  If you remember, we had this so-called national discussion about drones not too long ago, and it focused on, well, does the government have the power to kill a U.S.
[01:40:21.063 --> 01:40:21.423]  citizen?
[01:40:23.664 --> 01:40:25.005]  Should that really be the question?
[01:40:26.205 --> 01:40:27.265]  Does it matter if they're a U.S.
[01:40:27.305 --> 01:40:27.745]  citizen?
[01:40:28.346 --> 01:40:34.308]  Should we be killing anybody that we're not at war with by dropping a bomb from a drone on them?
[01:40:35.088 --> 01:40:38.909]  And a lot of civilians are dying because of the criminal actions of the United States.
[01:40:38.929 --> 01:40:42.670]  Well, then I've heard talk show hosts say, hey, war is terror.
[01:40:42.690 --> 01:40:50.293]  You know, we need to bomb more cities like in World War II, which again, Hitler was terrible, but if you actually really study the real history,
[01:40:51.013 --> 01:41:08.882]  He was only bombing military bases in England and they did nighttime raids on Berlin on civilian areas to trick the Nazis to bomb civilian stuff so the infrastructure wouldn't get destroyed and to get the people behind the war and Hitler played right into it and then that introduced the idea of unrestricted
[01:41:09.862 --> 01:41:14.987]  Submarine warfare on civilian ships, unrestricted bombing of whole cities.
[01:41:15.507 --> 01:41:18.670]  I mean, and then that led to bombing Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
[01:41:19.071 --> 01:41:27.879]  Even though the Japanese had already tried to give up days before, they wanted to set the precedent that the atomic age had begun.
[01:41:28.891 --> 01:41:30.332]  Yeah, this is not a new tactic.
[01:41:30.372 --> 01:41:38.978]  The United States military has used this tactic, as you alluded to, during World War II, in the fire bombings in Germany, in Japan, in Vietnam.
[01:41:39.638 --> 01:41:42.920]  And the drone program is just another example.
[01:41:43.501 --> 01:41:47.644]  I don't really think that it's intended to take out Al-Qaeda targets.
[01:41:47.664 --> 01:41:58.571]  I think its main purpose is psychological warfare to say, hey, you speak out against us, you act against us, we classify you as a terrorist, we will kill you and anybody around you.
[01:41:59.371 --> 01:42:00.332]  Well, it's more than that.
[01:42:00.392 --> 01:42:02.372]  That's what they tell the troops on the surface.
[01:42:02.852 --> 01:42:08.755]  In Pakistan, the globalists actually brought in 30,000 Taliban al-Qaeda leaders in the airlift of evil 2001-2002.
[01:42:09.195 --> 01:42:14.657]  That's BBC News, AP Reuters, and actually used them to destabilize.
[01:42:14.677 --> 01:42:19.839]  I've had Hamid Gul, their former top general on, and I don't just trust him, Mohammed Karzai has gone public.
[01:42:20.419 --> 01:42:23.221]  Now, it isn't that some of them aren't real terrorists, real jihadis.
[01:42:23.521 --> 01:42:30.865]  The issue is, is that they create an environment to where then they can use them to destabilize the country.
[01:42:31.146 --> 01:42:36.629]  And so it's just pure destabilization, just like they're using Al-Qaeda in Libya and Syria right now.
[01:42:39.179 --> 01:42:42.860]  And it's really the American people that give their consent to this program.
[01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:46.762]  That's another reason that I resigned was I wanted to withdraw my consent.
[01:42:47.262 --> 01:42:53.384]  Not only the American people, but the mainstream media are absolutely complicit in this because nobody talks about it.
[01:42:53.624 --> 01:42:54.845]  It's not on the evening news.
[01:42:54.905 --> 01:42:57.266]  It's not on the mainstream media news networks.
[01:42:58.186 --> 01:43:00.087]  We just kind of ignore it and accept it.
[01:43:00.127 --> 01:43:03.708]  We have consented to committing war crimes overseas.
[01:43:04.068 --> 01:43:09.671]  How do people find your Kickstarter campaign and donate to it or pledge to donate so that you can get this film made?
[01:43:10.712 --> 01:43:15.255]  Yeah, go to morelesshuman.com and it'll redirect you to the Kickstarter page.
[01:43:15.275 --> 01:43:17.977]  You can also search for my name at kickstarter.com.
[01:43:19.437 --> 01:43:21.499]  And you've already gotten 55,000 pledged to the 27,000 goal.
[01:43:24.724 --> 01:43:24.964]  Really?
[01:43:24.984 --> 01:43:25.024]  Oh, $55.
[01:43:25.966 --> 01:43:27.568]  I'm having a... Yeah, $55.
[01:43:28.109 --> 01:43:29.892]  We just kicked it off yesterday afternoon.
[01:43:29.932 --> 01:43:31.454]  You're the first one to get the word out.
[01:43:31.514 --> 01:43:31.794]  Oh, no, no.
[01:43:31.814 --> 01:43:35.760]  I mean, I was having a Freudian moment there because I'm so used to the success of these.
[01:43:36.060 --> 01:43:38.184]  I bet you've got $100,000 by tomorrow.
[01:43:39.065 --> 01:43:40.907]  That would be absolutely amazing.
[01:43:42.891 --> 01:43:45.875]  I'm very passionate about this subject, passionate about filmmaking.
[01:43:45.935 --> 01:43:49.759]  I want to draw as many people into this, helping make this picture as possible.
[01:43:49.799 --> 01:43:54.225]  So any ideas, any offers of help are more than welcome, not just financial support.
[01:43:54.465 --> 01:43:58.090]  Well that's fantastic, and I'm interested in what you're doing.
[01:43:58.830 --> 01:44:11.373]  Just because of the idea of people not committing suicide over, you know, having guilt and knowing they've done things that were wrong in the final equation, but now going and, you know, reproving what you've done.
[01:44:11.393 --> 01:44:13.093]  A reprieve for society.
[01:44:13.193 --> 01:44:14.193]  That's the answer.
[01:44:14.673 --> 01:44:15.934]  Let's talk about suicide.
[01:44:16.394 --> 01:44:20.955]  They talk about it being, what, seven-fold previous records from any war.
[01:44:21.015 --> 01:44:23.695]  More people dying from suicide than in combat.
[01:44:25.115 --> 01:44:27.936]  What has that been like for you, if you know anybody that's committed suicide?
[01:44:28.635 --> 01:44:32.740]  I haven't known anybody personally, but I can absolutely understand how someone can get to that point.
[01:44:33.141 --> 01:44:46.657]  When your whole world is built up around this idea that you're an American soldier or you're part of the establishment and everybody supports that, that's how you make your living, you're viewed as a hero because you went overseas.
[01:44:48.519 --> 01:44:55.503]  That creates your identity, and to go against your identity is a very scary thing, especially when you have no support system to do so.
[01:44:56.564 --> 01:45:03.027]  People get very scared, they feel trapped, and they think the only way out is to end their life, which is very sad.
[01:45:03.047 --> 01:45:06.609]  I would say to anybody out there who is thinking about taking that course, don't do it.
[01:45:06.709 --> 01:45:08.670]  You do not have to stay in the system.
[01:45:09.071 --> 01:45:14.634]  You do not have to continue to give your consent for anything that you find illegal, criminal, or otherwise.
[01:45:15.254 --> 01:45:21.661]  Now, I know that General Dynamics, where you just resigned from a few weeks ago, they actually make some of the latest drones that are out there.
[01:45:21.681 --> 01:45:22.822]  What were you working on there?
[01:45:23.543 --> 01:45:25.525]  I was working on the Stryker Combat Vehicle.
[01:45:26.066 --> 01:45:29.470]  It's an eight-wheeled vehicle platform.
[01:45:31.064 --> 01:45:33.746]  What do you make of the deployment now?
[01:45:33.786 --> 01:45:36.648]  It was 2,000 this year, but about 5,000 the last four years.
[01:45:37.368 --> 01:45:52.898]  More than 7,000 of the big war wagons that they've given to Homeland Security, the open training for, quote, combat with the American people, saying now that gun owners returning veterans, that they are the number one threat, not Al-Qaeda.
[01:45:52.918 --> 01:46:00.143]  I mean, they're clearly trying to flip the script now off of Muslim extremists that they've helped finance, in many cases, onto the American people.
[01:46:00.950 --> 01:46:03.872]  Yeah, I hadn't heard about that, Alex, but I'm not surprised.
[01:46:04.632 --> 01:46:12.498]  Like I said, when you start taking and using these tactics overseas, it's only a matter of time before they start seeing the people at home as enemies, too.
[01:46:12.578 --> 01:46:16.340]  And they always want to squash anyone who speaks out against them.
[01:46:16.360 --> 01:46:20.523]  If they're a whistleblower, an activist, otherwise.
[01:46:20.623 --> 01:46:25.286]  If you speak out against the power elite, you will feel their wrath.
[01:46:27.022 --> 01:46:33.623]  You know, you look at the former head of Google, but he still advises it, Eric Schmidt, who says you have no privacy.
[01:46:33.663 --> 01:46:39.764]  You look at the head of things like Facebook, Zuckerberg, saying his users are dumb effers for trusting him.
[01:46:40.084 --> 01:46:47.566]  But then they're obsessed with their privacy and have their girlfriends, in the case of Schmidt, wear hoods over their heads like Michael Jackson's kids.
[01:46:48.006 --> 01:46:53.227]  I mean, how do they think they're going to build this technocracy and then they're going to get away with it?
[01:46:53.767 --> 01:46:57.892]  I mean, the elite never get away with stuff when they build a tyranny.
[01:46:58.272 --> 01:47:06.362]  Smart elites, even if they're not moral, historically, and I've had a lot of top historians on who agree with me, they want to build something that has some checks and balances.
[01:47:06.802 --> 01:47:09.185]  I mean, this is madness what they're setting in motion.
[01:47:10.450 --> 01:47:11.331]  It's absolute madness.
[01:47:11.371 --> 01:47:32.144]  You can draw parallels back to totalitarian states of the past, and when you kind of wake up and realize that this is our government, the United States government, that's doing this, the baseball and apple pie and all that that you grew up with, the flag waving, and kind of try to reconcile that with the actions that you're seeing, it's hard to believe.
[01:47:32.224 --> 01:47:33.485]  But these things are taking place.
[01:47:33.505 --> 01:47:34.225]  They're documented.
[01:47:34.265 --> 01:47:39.769]  You can go out there and find lots of good information, solid information on this stuff, and it's happening.
[01:47:41.522 --> 01:48:00.126]  Sir, it's been very informative and uplifting to have you on, just to know that we can have folks that have been through terrible things like you've been through, because you're a victim of this as well, of the American people buying into mass delusion, just like the Nazis and the Soviets did, and it's great to see you, you know, helping turn the tide.
[01:48:00.146 --> 01:48:07.107]  I think we're starting to turn the tide, and that's why they're kind of coming out with everything now, in an attempt to hide it in plain view.
[01:48:07.727 --> 01:48:10.348]  What's your take on where we stand as a civilization?
[01:48:11.118 --> 01:48:11.658]  I hope so.
[01:48:11.739 --> 01:48:23.207]  I think more and more people are coming to realize that these actions are taking place because of brave whistleblowers like Bradley Manning and Edward Snowden who are coming out with evidence that they can't deny.
[01:48:23.887 --> 01:48:33.134]  More people are starting to wake up and I also agree with you that they're getting more and more overt in their illegal and criminal actions, which is terrifying.
[01:48:34.194 --> 01:48:41.117]  I'm worried about the country, but I think there are a lot of people here who will stand up, speak out, act when it's time to act.
[01:48:41.497 --> 01:48:43.098]  Well, they're trying to demoralize us.
[01:48:43.138 --> 01:48:44.499]  They're trying to break our will.
[01:48:44.539 --> 01:48:46.139]  They're using military tactics on us.
[01:48:46.479 --> 01:48:54.363]  But I found it's our military men and women that are the easiest to wake up because you guys are aware of these tactics and go, wait a minute, this is being used on all of us.
[01:48:55.003 --> 01:48:58.104]  And so you guys should not be as naive as the public.
[01:48:58.385 --> 01:49:09.729]  So as much as we can criticize the military for being involved in a lot of bad things, there's a reason Homeland Security says you're the number one enemy once you're out, because you are one of our biggest hopes, and you're showing that right now.
[01:49:10.050 --> 01:49:11.130]  Brandon, we salute you.
[01:49:11.190 --> 01:49:11.950]  God bless you, sir.
[01:49:12.571 --> 01:49:13.251]  Thank you so much.
[01:49:13.291 --> 01:49:15.152]  Thanks for having me on, Alex.
[01:49:15.192 --> 01:49:15.532]  You bet.
[01:49:15.552 --> 01:49:16.492]  And we want to help you.
[01:49:16.532 --> 01:49:19.214]  Give out that website one more time so we can get you the money you need.
[01:49:19.714 --> 01:49:19.914]  Sure.
[01:49:19.974 --> 01:49:21.595]  It's morelesshuman.com.
[01:49:22.415 --> 01:49:24.117]  MoreLessHuman.com.
[01:49:24.217 --> 01:49:24.737]  God bless you.
[01:49:24.757 --> 01:49:25.358]  Great idea.
[01:49:25.678 --> 01:49:27.860]  People can see your breakdown there on the site.
[01:49:27.880 --> 01:49:28.320]  Thank you, sir.
[01:49:28.801 --> 01:49:29.241]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:49:29.802 --> 01:49:30.262]  All right, folks.
[01:49:30.282 --> 01:49:35.106]  We're going to come back and get to the latest NSA news that I've just mentioned, and then Katherine Albrecht's going to come in.
[01:49:35.126 --> 01:49:41.952]  We're going to go through all of it with her, and I've got a bunch of other news as well on the economy and on the fake terror alerts.
[01:49:41.972 --> 01:49:44.414]  I think I'll cover that when we come back in the next short segment.
[01:49:45.115 --> 01:49:48.038]  Briefly, I want to tell you about an amazing sponsor.
[01:49:48.598 --> 01:49:49.618]  That we've had for a long time.
[01:49:49.638 --> 01:49:55.641]  They have some of the best colloidal silver and souped-up colloidal silver type systems out there.
[01:49:55.701 --> 01:49:57.041]  It's supernatural silver.
[01:49:58.142 --> 01:50:05.245]  Pathogens are becoming increasingly dangerous, causing deadly outbreaks in hospitals, nursing homes, schools, and restaurants.
[01:50:05.645 --> 01:50:08.146]  Antibiotics are ineffective because they are overused.
[01:50:08.906 --> 01:50:16.129]  New supernatural silver offers a safe and effective means of killing pathogens where antibiotics and other drugs fail.

[01:50:34.021 --> 01:50:34.662]  I've noticed that...
[01:50:35.663 --> 01:50:40.706]  When I use normal allergy stuff and my size doesn't work, when I use this sprayed into my nose, it knocks it out.
[01:50:41.086 --> 01:50:48.169]  SupernaturalSilver.com or follow their banners on InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.

[01:52:01.237 --> 01:52:05.318]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[01:52:05.998 --> 01:52:08.099]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:52:09.029 --> 01:52:17.352]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[01:52:17.992 --> 01:52:22.894]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

[01:53:06.051 --> 01:53:10.475]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[01:53:10.635 --> 01:53:16.600]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[01:53:16.720 --> 01:53:27.488]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.
[01:53:27.708 --> 01:53:33.993]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[01:53:34.193 --> 01:53:49.206]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands, and
[01:53:49.366 --> 01:53:51.168]  Sodium hexafluorosilicate.

[01:54:28.115 --> 01:54:30.777]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, Catherine Albrecht.
[01:54:31.417 --> 01:54:38.141]  Dr. Catherine Albrecht has got a degree in analyzing all this police state surveillance grid garbage from Harvard.
[01:54:38.682 --> 01:54:48.428]  She's going to be joining us to talk about the prison planet and the big developments, not just with the government spying on you, but private corporations and what they're up to.
[01:54:49.454 --> 01:54:54.617]  In the next hour we'll open the phones up for Catherine Albrecht as well.
[01:54:55.618 --> 01:55:03.383]  But whenever I get into this NSA news, you have to understand, and I'm going to play these clips as well, when Clapper, the head of national security,
[01:55:05.643 --> 01:55:14.827]  Our National Intelligence, and then when the head of the NSA and the head of Cyber Command, General Alexander, come out and say, we're not spying on any of you.
[01:55:15.387 --> 01:55:16.148]  We promise.
[01:55:16.188 --> 01:55:17.128]  I'm going to play those clips.
[01:55:17.848 --> 01:55:19.649]  And then it comes out they're recording everything.
[01:55:19.729 --> 01:55:21.170]  They don't call that spying.
[01:55:21.570 --> 01:55:22.911]  They call that intelligence.
[01:55:23.551 --> 01:55:25.452]  They're playing all these little games with people.
[01:55:26.232 --> 01:55:27.573]  And now it's in Reuters today.
[01:55:27.693 --> 01:55:30.414]  Oh, they hand off criminal info.
[01:55:31.935 --> 01:55:32.355]  Criminal.
[01:55:33.376 --> 01:55:35.518]  Which is like, oh, you built a barn in your backyard.
[01:55:35.558 --> 01:55:42.145]  That came out years ago, that the NSA was giving satellite info to local environmental ordinances, to the local police.
[01:55:42.185 --> 01:55:44.407]  I mean, see, that's how I already knew all this.
[01:55:44.907 --> 01:55:49.612]  That's what's so frustrating, is that they didn't want you knowing about this 15 years ago, so they denied it.
[01:55:50.353 --> 01:55:54.216]  Now, they're going to use it against everybody and really roll out the tyranny.
[01:55:54.537 --> 01:55:55.738]  They can't hide it anymore.
[01:55:57.173 --> 01:56:08.418]  I told you a few times last month that they don't like having to go get a warrant after they've already used illegal intelligence, spying, to go bust people for petty crimes.
[01:56:08.478 --> 01:56:11.319]  So now they're just going to say, you know what, we're not doing any of that anymore.
[01:56:12.179 --> 01:56:13.980]  No more due process, no more nothing.
[01:56:14.360 --> 01:56:17.681]  This is their revolution against the Republic.
[01:56:17.781 --> 01:56:23.924]  Their revolution against law and possession is nine-tenths of the law, and they're just doing it openly right now.
[01:56:25.746 --> 01:56:26.907]  Everything else will go.
[01:56:27.007 --> 01:56:29.008]  Your guns, your speech, it's all going.
[01:56:29.689 --> 01:56:34.172]  The borders, the sovereignty, your pension funds, your security, your due process.
[01:56:34.672 --> 01:56:36.813]  It's like blowing a hole in a spaceship.
[01:56:37.134 --> 01:56:38.935]  The atmosphere of the spaceship goes where?
[01:56:39.415 --> 01:56:40.116]  Into space.
[01:56:40.916 --> 01:56:42.337]  You need an atmosphere, folks.
[01:56:42.637 --> 01:56:53.902]  The Bill of Rights Constitution, due process, is the atmosphere of a free, healthy country, where you can have companies, where you can contract with people, where you've got a rule of law.
[01:56:54.363 --> 01:57:03.227]  Collectivism and a ruling government that's not accountable is called tyranny, and the fruit that comes out of it is worse than what comes out of the end of a horse.
[01:57:04.047 --> 01:57:05.548]  At least you can use that for fertilizer.
[01:57:06.892 --> 01:57:11.594]  It's not right to call the globalists, you know, Brava Sierra, because that's calling them something nice.
[01:57:11.694 --> 01:57:16.277]  It's like airborne Ebola to our liberty.
[01:57:17.877 --> 01:57:18.718]  And I mean, look at this.
[01:57:18.738 --> 01:57:21.039]  I'm going to get into this with Albrecht.
[01:57:21.059 --> 01:57:21.419]  19 U.S.
[01:57:21.479 --> 01:57:26.882]  posts remain closed this week as lawmakers say terror threats, specific and serious, the worst since 9-11.
[01:57:26.902 --> 01:57:28.663]  And they said, get ready.
[01:57:28.883 --> 01:57:30.103]  And they use terms on the news.
[01:57:30.163 --> 01:57:31.424]  I played this yesterday on the Sunday Show.
[01:57:32.486 --> 01:57:33.647]  They go, it's scary, isn't it?
[01:57:33.867 --> 01:57:34.627]  Oh, it's scary.
[01:57:35.367 --> 01:57:38.148]  General Clapper, or General Alexander, it's scary.
[01:57:38.208 --> 01:57:38.489]  Oh, yes.
[01:57:38.929 --> 01:57:39.869]  General Hayden, it's scary.
[01:57:39.929 --> 01:57:40.209]  Oh, yes.
[01:57:40.289 --> 01:57:42.650]  It's very, I'm very scared.
[01:57:43.010 --> 01:57:46.052]  I mean, they're actually on TV going, ooga booga.
[01:57:49.333 --> 01:57:51.094]  Like you're trying to scare a five-year-old or something.
[01:57:54.346 --> 01:58:01.511]  I remember having babysitters and stuff when I was like 3, 4, 5 years old, and sometimes we'd be in the backyard at night, going back in the house, and they'd go, ooooh.
[01:58:01.571 --> 01:58:04.513]  They'd get behind a bush and shake it like they were a ghost and I'd get scared.
[01:58:04.813 --> 01:58:09.757]  I mean, they're literally on the news going, let us spy on you and take your rights and have tens of billions of no bid.
[01:58:10.237 --> 01:58:14.020]  Spying contracts are here, Al-Qaeda, we'll get you!
[01:58:14.600 --> 01:58:17.182]  And then meanwhile, they run Al-Qaeda in these countries.
[01:58:17.563 --> 01:58:21.926]  They've got a murdering Christians, Kurds, you name it, mass, on record.
[01:58:22.566 --> 01:58:25.688]  And they're just clouding the water like an octopus squirts out ink.
[01:58:26.208 --> 01:58:27.809]  Or I guess a squid squirts out ink.
[01:58:28.230 --> 01:58:30.311]  Just going, oh, al-Qaeda!
[01:58:30.351 --> 01:58:32.152]  Did I show you how scary al-Qaeda was?
[01:58:32.532 --> 01:58:35.354]  If that doesn't scare you, this mask will really scare you.
[01:58:35.974 --> 01:58:39.316]  Meanwhile, the whole grid is admittedly built for the American people.
[01:58:42.158 --> 01:58:45.780]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.820 --> 01:58:47.882]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.522 --> 01:58:56.085]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[01:58:56.245 --> 01:59:04.590]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet, the highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease?
[01:59:04.910 --> 01:59:06.572]  It all comes down to one thing.
[01:59:06.592 --> 01:59:06.952]  We are
[01:59:08.492 --> 01:59:12.814]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[01:59:13.154 --> 01:59:17.135]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and Big Pharma runoff.
[01:59:17.375 --> 01:59:19.696]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[01:59:19.936 --> 01:59:25.858]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[01:59:56.929 --> 01:59:59.690]  Alex Jones, on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:06.308 --> 02:00:10.512]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:11.153 --> 02:00:11.973]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.734 --> 02:00:13.715]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.296 --> 02:00:17.899]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.480 --> 02:00:22.544]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:28.228 --> 02:00:37.438]  Catherine Albrecht is going to be joining us to look at the full emergence of the illegal spy grid that we've documented for myself 18 years, her for about 13 or 14.
[02:00:40.168 --> 02:00:43.150]  By the way, I know why I wanted her on last week, and now I'm gonna do NSA.
[02:00:43.170 --> 02:01:03.564]  Will you guys print me those stories about stores can tell wealthy patrons via face scanning cameras, but also now stores have databases, like people that have expensive web surfing habits get charged more, online retailers charging people more according to their search history.
[02:01:03.884 --> 02:01:08.147]  I mean, this just shows how the AI system is meant to game everything.
[02:01:10.421 --> 02:01:13.322]  Just like Walmart gamed the small towns and shut them down.
[02:01:13.382 --> 02:01:18.464]  Just like Amazon gamed all the bookstores and shut them down.
[02:01:20.265 --> 02:01:23.786]  You know, what happens when all the little bookstores are gone and then Amazon can do whatever it wants?
[02:01:25.087 --> 02:01:26.887]  They'll be exempt from taxes, but you won't.
[02:01:27.408 --> 02:01:29.969]  They get special consideration, then your online bookstore isn't.
[02:01:31.749 --> 02:01:33.410]  Makes it very hard to run an online bookstore.
[02:01:33.430 --> 02:01:34.690]  I'll tell you, I have one.
[02:01:34.750 --> 02:01:35.831]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:01:36.732 --> 02:01:37.232]  Yeah, there it is.
[02:01:37.292 --> 02:01:39.493]  Websites vary prices.
[02:01:39.533 --> 02:01:41.194]  Deals based on users' information.
[02:01:41.474 --> 02:01:42.174]  Wall Street Journal.
[02:01:42.214 --> 02:01:42.854]  Print that for me.
[02:01:42.874 --> 02:01:47.396]  I want to just... Because this is everything she exposed on the customer loyalty cards.
[02:01:47.996 --> 02:01:55.899]  And, you know, you go to a box store and even smaller regional ones pump you for info and won't shut up.
[02:01:56.780 --> 02:01:59.361]  And then you go, hey, listen, I know that's a corporate pitch you're supposed to give.
[02:01:59.501 --> 02:02:00.281]  I'm just here to buy it.
[02:02:01.361 --> 02:02:03.982]  You know, I'm just here buying some children's books for my kids.
[02:02:04.803 --> 02:02:05.343]  I'm just, you know...
[02:02:06.257 --> 02:02:07.517]  Well, you'll get a discount if you do.
[02:02:07.557 --> 02:02:08.257]  And I go, okay.
[02:02:09.558 --> 02:02:12.098]  After they won't stop and roll their eyes, I go, you're getting a speech now.
[02:02:12.678 --> 02:02:15.459]  These loyalty cards are meant to figure out consumer behavior.
[02:02:15.919 --> 02:02:19.420]  I signed an agreement to waive my rights so what I'm reading can be given to people.
[02:02:19.640 --> 02:02:20.200]  Well, so what?
[02:02:20.220 --> 02:02:20.840]  They already know.
[02:02:20.860 --> 02:02:22.261]  That's usually what a slave says.
[02:02:24.181 --> 02:02:27.002]  And see, I mean, I see people all the time going, well, I don't care.
[02:02:28.277 --> 02:02:35.442]  If these companies go bankrupt, I don't own any stock in them, or I don't care, I don't work at General Motors, so what if they move to China?
[02:02:36.022 --> 02:02:38.844]  You don't understand, folks, it all affects you anyways.
[02:02:39.605 --> 02:02:46.450]  And I wouldn't be against General Motors going to China if they paid people $20 an hour, because then they'd make so much money they could buy American goods.
[02:02:47.190 --> 02:02:52.712]  They're just, they pay them 18 hours a day, working till blood comes out of their fingers.
[02:02:52.972 --> 02:02:54.132]  They got suicide nets.
[02:02:54.152 --> 02:02:54.752]  They drug them.
[02:02:54.992 --> 02:03:01.714]  They have forced abortions because Al Gore demands top, you know, highest levels of abuse out of his factories.
[02:03:01.754 --> 02:03:02.894]  He runs Apple.
[02:03:03.494 --> 02:03:04.615]  Because he's liberal, it's okay.
[02:03:04.635 --> 02:03:05.815]  I mean, Obama bombs people.
[02:03:05.855 --> 02:03:06.915]  He's black, so it's alright.
[02:03:07.696 --> 02:03:13.977]  And they've now ordered the 15 million robots, last time I checked, and millions have been delivered.
[02:03:14.537 --> 02:03:16.178]  And they just say, go out and die!
[02:03:17.233 --> 02:03:21.015]  And they have thousands of riots a month in China as people starve to death.
[02:03:21.756 --> 02:03:25.538]  And the police are just mowing people down, murdering whoever they want.
[02:03:26.118 --> 02:03:28.479]  Looks like a scene out of Elysium or something, the trailer.
[02:03:29.940 --> 02:03:32.382]  Or out of District 9, same director.
[02:03:32.822 --> 02:03:34.383]  I mean, this stuff's already going on.
[02:03:34.403 --> 02:03:39.165]  There's already life extension technologies we're not going to be given access to under Obamacare.
[02:03:40.246 --> 02:03:43.008]  I mean, you want front row seats to hell, folks, you're going to get it.
[02:03:43.808 --> 02:03:46.630]  And people say, well, there are too many people.
[02:03:47.677 --> 02:03:54.863]  And I agree there are unsustainable too large a number of people in some areas of the world because of other technologies being suppressed.
[02:03:54.963 --> 02:03:58.106]  Once you industrialize people, they quit having more than two kids.
[02:03:58.766 --> 02:04:05.211]  Doesn't matter whether they're Japanese or Italian or a Hispanic American family or a white American or black family.
[02:04:05.612 --> 02:04:11.617]  It's these third world populations that have a bunch of kids because they haven't been conditioned yet not to have them.
[02:04:12.498 --> 02:04:13.139]  Artificially.
[02:04:13.339 --> 02:04:20.487]  But you don't even have to do that, because once people become wealthy, they stop having as many children.
[02:04:21.908 --> 02:04:26.313]  But it won't matter with new technological development, and if they would stop blocking the development,
[02:04:27.182 --> 02:04:29.825]  You're going to absolutely be able to launch space colonies.
[02:04:30.845 --> 02:04:33.188]  They've had the designs for that for at least 50 years.
[02:04:33.248 --> 02:04:35.290]  Werner Von Braun had some of the designs for that.
[02:04:35.890 --> 02:04:39.233]  For the type of model, the artificial gravity with the big spinning wheel.
[02:04:39.253 --> 02:04:45.720]  I mean, we need giant projects like that that humanity gets behind before we expend
[02:04:46.320 --> 02:04:58.761]  The resources that we're based on right now, while the globalists block the development, because they want to use the artificial scarcity of the old resource paradigm to consolidate total control over everyone.
[02:04:58.781 --> 02:04:59.702]  Well, there I book.
[02:05:01.741 --> 02:05:05.383]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us?
[02:05:05.604 --> 02:05:10.887]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[02:05:11.127 --> 02:05:18.632]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[02:05:18.852 --> 02:05:28.038]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[02:05:28.158 --> 02:05:35.142]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[02:05:35.343 --> 02:05:38.244]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[02:05:38.384 --> 02:05:45.149]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse but demand a war.
[02:05:46.263 --> 02:05:46.743]  Another one!
[02:05:46.803 --> 02:05:47.964]  Another plane just hit!

[02:08:31.135 --> 02:08:36.737]  Folks, here are some of the breaking InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com headlines.
[02:08:37.958 --> 02:08:43.980]  Conscientious objection by a former soldier and defense contractor, Brandon Toy, who we just had on in the last hour.
[02:08:44.400 --> 02:08:47.142]  That article's been reposted to the top of InfoWars.com.
[02:08:47.722 --> 02:08:49.763]  A very sad story to watch the video.
[02:08:49.803 --> 02:08:54.625]  Toddler dies in CPS captivity after being taken away from marijuana-smoking parents.
[02:08:54.665 --> 02:08:54.865]  Yeah.
[02:08:55.445 --> 02:09:01.148]  Now the cops are taking tissue swabs out of your cheek, because those cells just peel right off.
[02:09:01.168 --> 02:09:02.049]  They just swab you.
[02:09:02.469 --> 02:09:05.571]  And if they find any marijuana, your children are taken by CPS.
[02:09:06.071 --> 02:09:09.713]  So the persecution of people is only intensifying.
[02:09:10.093 --> 02:09:16.657]  And then they take your child and, well, a lot of times, you're seven times more likely to die in CPS custody than any other group.
[02:09:17.137 --> 02:09:18.378]  Just the department's own numbers.
[02:09:18.478 --> 02:09:20.239]  I mean, it's just full of scum of the earth.
[02:09:21.540 --> 02:09:24.722]  Boston bomber linked with right-wing conspiracy theorist.
[02:09:25.362 --> 02:09:26.603]  We knew that was going to be coming out.
[02:09:26.803 --> 02:09:31.146]  They're absolutely trying to demonize yours truly, as usual, claiming he did it because of me.
[02:09:32.067 --> 02:09:36.850]  Al-Nasra mercenaries in Syria slaughtered Kurdish women and children.
[02:09:36.890 --> 02:09:40.653]  That's the group that they actually used to attack and kill Ambassador Stevens.
[02:09:40.673 --> 02:09:43.235]  They were hired to run security in Benghazi.
[02:09:43.275 --> 02:09:44.276]  That's the big cover up there.
[02:09:44.736 --> 02:09:46.237]  Fourth Amendment dead in Los Angeles.
[02:09:46.257 --> 02:09:52.382]  The police go around just randomly searching vehicles and parking lots now and saying they can do whatever they effing want, close quote.
[02:09:53.383 --> 02:10:00.008]  And that is Pat Cadell, one of the big national pollsters, says John Boehner is aiding Obama in cover-up of Benghazi.
[02:10:00.128 --> 02:10:00.708]  Absolutely.
[02:10:01.489 --> 02:10:02.830]  Eyewitness to Hastings crash.
[02:10:02.850 --> 02:10:04.711]  They've now been forced to release the police reports.
[02:10:05.132 --> 02:10:08.715]  Giant explosion as it drove down the road before going over to the tree.
[02:10:09.435 --> 02:10:11.477]  And the surveillance footage that came out last week shows that.
[02:10:11.917 --> 02:10:15.600]  It blows up, like the witnesses all said, driving down the road, boom!
[02:10:15.700 --> 02:10:18.602]  Blows up like a car bomb, and then goes off the road into a tree.
[02:10:20.944 --> 02:10:22.325]  Exactly as we told you day one.
[02:10:23.106 --> 02:10:28.210]  So, that, and there's another article, is the government exaggerating the threat of terror for political reasons?
[02:10:29.411 --> 02:10:32.454]  Again, do grizzly bears live in the woods?
[02:10:33.795 --> 02:10:36.437]  Do bears eat honey in the woods?
[02:10:37.691 --> 02:10:40.893]  Do bears fish for salmon in the woods?
[02:10:42.114 --> 02:10:43.495]  Do bears crap in the woods?
[02:10:43.595 --> 02:10:46.957]  I'm sorry, it's just I read this headline.
[02:10:47.257 --> 02:10:49.758]  Washington's blog is awesome, but it's like a rhetorical question.
[02:10:50.139 --> 02:10:52.160]  Does the sun come up in the east in the morning?
[02:10:53.280 --> 02:10:55.101]  Does the Easter Bunny have pink ears?
[02:10:55.741 --> 02:11:00.124]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, it just, I shouldn't be laughing about it, I just smell false flag.
[02:11:00.144 --> 02:11:03.826]  They're like, this is as scary as a new 9-11, this is what happened last time.
[02:11:04.246 --> 02:11:10.830]  Get ready, we're gonna get hit, we need the NSA, we need Obama, we need Al-Qaeda, Al-Qaeda!
[02:11:11.150 --> 02:11:12.971]  And we're going, you've been funding Al-Qaeda.
[02:11:13.832 --> 02:11:15.313]  You've been giving them heat-seeking missiles.
[02:11:15.693 --> 02:11:21.396]  Let's look at DrudgeReport.com, the genius of why all marvel at DrudgeReport.com.
[02:11:21.416 --> 02:11:22.237]  Can we punch that up?
[02:11:23.430 --> 02:11:26.271]  Just this weekend, I'm working on Obama Deception 2.
[02:11:27.152 --> 02:11:31.294]  And I said, we've got to update this with these new fake terror alerts early on in the film.
[02:11:31.694 --> 02:11:38.037]  And I want to show people, you know, them saying, Bryce Ferrell kind of attacks closing embassies, and then cut to duck and cover.
[02:11:38.278 --> 02:11:42.240]  And the kids being told, you know, there's a hydrogen bomb being dropped on you, jump out of the desk.
[02:11:42.280 --> 02:11:42.760]  There's nothing.
[02:11:43.300 --> 02:11:44.381]  It was all about fear.
[02:11:44.401 --> 02:11:50.864]  They later admitted it was to create a climate of total fear, while our government gave reactors and nukes to the Russians.
[02:11:51.484 --> 02:11:55.806]  Because our government's defense contractors want to keep more sales going, you understand.
[02:11:57.040 --> 02:12:07.343]  And Drudge gets it, because, I mean, I'm thinking this here yesterday, putting it in the film, that this is duck and cover bull, and I haven't talked to Drudge, I haven't talked to any of his crew, but let's put it up there.
[02:12:07.623 --> 02:12:09.584]  And they get the exact same thing.
[02:12:09.964 --> 02:12:14.425]  Not because we happen to have similar brains, we happen to have brains that get reality.
[02:12:16.586 --> 02:12:18.367]  Exactly what I've been talking about.
[02:12:18.487 --> 02:12:23.008]  Exactly what I said in a Saturday night, in a Sunday meeting, with the crew up here.
[02:12:24.574 --> 02:12:28.638]  I've been in seven day work week mode right now, big time.
[02:12:30.340 --> 02:12:31.701]  So that's just some of what we have.
[02:12:31.781 --> 02:12:39.929]  Oh, and by the way, Reuters has the exclusive, the Threat Fusion Centers and local police are given petty crime info.
[02:12:39.949 --> 02:12:49.458]  Marijuana, building a barn you're not supposed to, the NSA satellite video, photos, audio, everything is given to local police.
[02:12:51.687 --> 02:12:55.108]  And then the local police that are part of this become federally deputized.
[02:12:55.408 --> 02:12:56.749]  So that violates local control.
[02:12:56.809 --> 02:12:57.629]  I mean, it violates everything.
[02:12:57.889 --> 02:13:06.472]  And now they're going, let's just get rid of it all together because we don't want to have to go open a fake investigation to act like we got the info for the indictment or whatever some other way.
[02:13:07.233 --> 02:13:16.696]  And it also came out in USA Today that, well, in the case of Boston alone, they allowed informants to commit 5,000 plus crimes.
[02:13:19.830 --> 02:13:21.292]  Murder, you name it.
[02:13:22.193 --> 02:13:23.776]  Well, of course, they work for them.
[02:13:23.836 --> 02:13:25.478]  They go out and kill people that don't pay their cut.
[02:13:26.519 --> 02:13:32.007]  The organized crime in this country is, let's say the names, FBI, CIA, Defense Intelligence.
[02:13:32.347 --> 02:13:36.153]  I mean, folks, I have family, a lot of family that was in the Army.
[02:13:37.523 --> 02:13:50.569]  And I've been to family reunions and things where, I mean, it's like, I guess that's the only jobs or something in East Texas, where this person was in the CIA, and this person was in Air Force Intelligence, and this person was Sheep Dip Special Forces, and this person was that.
[02:13:50.989 --> 02:13:55.511]  I mean, I knew about all this stuff before I was out of high school.
[02:13:59.042 --> 02:14:00.843]  People would read the newspaper and laugh about it.
[02:14:30.483 --> 02:14:35.907]  Chris, and in this case we didn't get in trouble with his wife and stuff, you don't want to tell the story but he said he will if I want him to.
[02:14:36.728 --> 02:14:45.735]  During the last segment I said when I'm at Barnes & Noble or a grocery store or anywhere and they keep going, hey take a customer loyalty card, take it, take it, like three times I'll go, okay, you're getting a speech.
[02:14:47.771 --> 02:14:51.874]  If I see a woman who's pregnant, I walk over and say, don't take vaccines, check into the, read the insert.
[02:14:52.354 --> 02:14:54.615]  I see people with, you know, the fluoride water for babies.
[02:14:54.675 --> 02:14:57.877]  I go, look up Harvard study on fluoride and children brain damage.
[02:14:58.337 --> 02:15:00.619]  I mean, I do it not because I'm a busybody.
[02:15:00.719 --> 02:15:01.900]  I'm fighting the new world order.
[02:15:02.400 --> 02:15:05.622]  I fight them on air, off air, in my sleep, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:15:07.111 --> 02:15:13.059]  And so I was telling the story of every time I go into Barnes & Noble, they'll sit there and go, come on, you know you want the loyalty card.
[02:15:13.099 --> 02:15:13.980]  Come on, it'll save you money.
[02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:17.264]  And I go, no, that lets them use my data and sell it.
[02:15:17.284 --> 02:15:17.764]  Well, so what?
[02:15:17.784 --> 02:15:18.886]  They already know what you're doing.
[02:15:19.306 --> 02:15:20.267]  The point is it's wrong.
[02:15:21.326 --> 02:15:23.809]  And the point is they use this data to game the prices.
[02:15:24.450 --> 02:15:27.553]  I go, I'm actually a national expert on this, when they start disagreeing with me.
[02:15:27.814 --> 02:15:29.416]  And I go, have you heard of Dr. Katherine Albrecht?
[02:15:29.696 --> 02:15:31.178]  I say, have you heard of Infowars.com?
[02:15:31.558 --> 02:15:33.120]  And sometimes they'll go, yeah, I know who you are.
[02:15:33.961 --> 02:15:36.965]  Well, he's laughing out there during the break going, you don't understand.
[02:15:37.265 --> 02:15:38.626]  This weekend I went to a party.
[02:15:40.176 --> 02:15:43.238]  And one of my wife's friends, we basically had to end up leaving the party.
[02:15:43.438 --> 02:15:48.941]  When she found out I worked for you, she brought me up trying to warn people nicely about it.
[02:15:49.802 --> 02:15:52.223]  Okay, so I mean, I don't just tell these stories, folks.
[02:15:52.784 --> 02:15:55.125]  And again, I'm the bad one for being informed.
[02:15:55.465 --> 02:15:57.126]  So I don't want to get in a fight with your wife's friend.
[02:15:57.146 --> 02:15:58.147]  I'm sure she's a nice lady.
[02:15:58.487 --> 02:15:59.548]  Oh, she's a fantastic lady.
[02:15:59.568 --> 02:16:00.788]  Yeah, she's a fantastic lady.
[02:16:00.808 --> 02:16:02.970]  We've prefaced it with that, but you heard me telling the story.
[02:16:03.630 --> 02:16:05.795]  And then you're saying, she said a month ago this happened.
[02:16:05.815 --> 02:16:07.178]  Yeah, that was the last time.
[02:16:07.298 --> 02:16:08.300]  I'll let him three times.
[02:16:08.621 --> 02:16:14.934]  It was just a little while ago, she said, and you came in, purchased a whole bunch of books, and she said, you know, would you...
[02:16:17.947 --> 02:16:19.848]  Would you would you like to save some money?
[02:16:20.388 --> 02:16:37.298]  And uh... you said no no thank you and well of course she gave it the second shot and after that that's when you that's when you started in with the the Alex speech about you know not not signing up for customer loyalty cards or giving anybody your personal information about things.
[02:16:38.699 --> 02:16:41.380]  And then uh... tell the rest the story you had to leave the party.
[02:16:41.680 --> 02:16:45.703]  Yeah yeah it got a little heated after a little while and uh... I was
[02:16:46.581 --> 02:16:47.041]  Well say it!
[02:16:47.082 --> 02:16:48.943]  She said I'm, I mean she said I'm bad, right?
[02:16:48.983 --> 02:16:50.124]  Yeah, yeah, she did.
[02:16:50.185 --> 02:16:51.185]  She said that I'm evil.
[02:16:51.446 --> 02:16:52.747]  Yeah, she said that you were evil.
[02:16:52.767 --> 02:17:07.261]  She said that you were an evil person and that you do nothing but try to spread fear to people and not tell the truth but obscure everything and it was pretty out there.
[02:17:07.932 --> 02:17:12.816]  Yeah, just like I told everybody that the sheriff and police were dealing drugs and they later got caught where I grew up in Rockwall.
[02:17:13.337 --> 02:17:14.658]  See, this is incredible.
[02:17:14.858 --> 02:17:17.000]  And again, I'm not trying to be mean to your friend.
[02:17:17.020 --> 02:17:18.561]  I mean, we're not even going to say her name or anything.
[02:17:19.101 --> 02:17:20.983]  The whole point is, this just all blurs for me.
[02:17:21.483 --> 02:17:27.608]  I see a pregnant woman, I'll walk over and go, hey, please look into vaccines hurting babies because I've got three children and I really care.
[02:17:27.628 --> 02:17:28.929]  And usually they're like, oh, more info.
[02:17:28.989 --> 02:17:30.451]  I'll say, yeah, just read the insert.
[02:17:30.931 --> 02:17:33.533]  It'll say I can give them neurological disorders or even kill them.
[02:17:33.833 --> 02:17:37.997]  You didn't use to vaccinate pregnant women or newborn babies until just a few years ago.
[02:17:38.337 --> 02:17:39.318]  Just please look into it.
[02:17:39.338 --> 02:17:42.120]  And sometimes somebody will go, hey what are you doing talking to my wife?
[02:17:42.140 --> 02:17:44.382]  And I'll go, well sir people used to talk to each other.
[02:17:44.862 --> 02:17:49.906]  And you know I do this regardless because I have broken with the New World Order.
[02:17:50.907 --> 02:17:55.671]  I am 100% at war with these murderers and I'm going to try to protect as many people as I can.
[02:17:56.051 --> 02:17:57.792]  I would be immoral if I didn't do that.
[02:17:58.173 --> 02:17:59.333]  And I give these clerks
[02:18:00.182 --> 02:18:02.805]  You know, I mean, because they're already tracking you when you go to Amazon or whatever.
[02:18:03.185 --> 02:18:05.107]  I give them, you know, I give them two or three chumps.
[02:18:05.228 --> 02:18:11.795]  And man, when they start laying into me, laughing at me, I'll go, hey, don't use peer pressure just because your managers are watching you to make me get into this thing.
[02:18:11.835 --> 02:18:13.937]  You may not know what it's about, but you need to look into it.
[02:18:14.338 --> 02:18:16.921]  Thank you so much, Chris, for telling that story.
[02:18:17.822 --> 02:18:19.143]  Catherine, we're going to break here in a moment.
[02:18:19.163 --> 02:18:21.206]  She's got a show right here on the GCN Radio Network as well.
[02:18:21.546 --> 02:18:25.712]  Dr. Catherine Albrecht, technology expert on the whole spy grid.
[02:18:25.732 --> 02:18:27.914]  You heard me just tell the story briefly.
[02:18:29.216 --> 02:18:33.662]  I've heard you talk about, I mean, you try to educate them as well, and so I guess that means you're evil as well?
[02:18:34.906 --> 02:18:37.787]  You know, we're a little less evil nowadays, don't you think, Alex?
[02:18:37.847 --> 02:18:41.588]  Because I think Edward Snowden did a lot to wake people up.
[02:18:42.089 --> 02:18:46.770]  I think now, what I've heard from a lot of people, I didn't believe you ten years ago.
[02:18:46.850 --> 02:18:50.332]  I mean, I've had random people that I can't even remember looking me up.
[02:18:51.292 --> 02:19:10.795]  emailing me out of the blue telling me I'm so sorry I didn't believe you now now that it's all coming true and now that you know NPR is talking about it now I believe you and you know so so yeah I think I think people would wish that we would shut up not because they want us to shut up necessarily but because they want the things that we're saying not to be true
[02:19:11.536 --> 02:19:22.889]  And I think you hit a certain point where Edward Snowden's saying it, NPR is saying it, CNN is saying it, everybody's saying it, and really the only difference is we've been saying it longer and better and louder and we give you more details.
[02:19:25.003 --> 02:19:25.583]  Well said.
[02:19:25.623 --> 02:19:30.307]  I'm going to come back and get into the Snowden situation, the NSA bombshells, and a lot more.
[02:19:30.347 --> 02:19:34.490]  I know you've got a lot that's front and center on your radar screen as well.
[02:19:34.530 --> 02:19:36.151]  Dr. Kathryn Albrecht is our guest.
[02:19:36.231 --> 02:19:37.852]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[02:19:37.872 --> 02:19:45.678]  But Jordan said even more out there during the break about what was being said about me, and that's fine.
[02:19:46.616 --> 02:19:47.037]  That's fine.
[02:19:47.077 --> 02:19:59.935]  I mean, I'm there, you know, buying books with somebody trying to bully me into doing, filling out some form to waive my rights, and I just told her, hey, this is being used to spy and game the people that are buying stuff here.
[02:20:02.119 --> 02:20:15.249]  With over 3,000 years of historic use, Pure Silver continues to be one of nature's most reliable and effective agents against fighting viruses, mold, fungus, bacteria, pathogens and parasites.

[02:21:01.431 --> 02:21:05.533]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[02:21:06.194 --> 02:21:09.135]  I want you to know some very important information.
[02:21:09.235 --> 02:21:17.539]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[02:21:18.189 --> 02:21:23.112]  Now, 27 years later, carnivore capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

[02:21:57.962 --> 02:21:58.943]  Protect your immune system.

[02:22:00.945 --> 02:22:02.146]  You know about RVs.
[02:22:02.346 --> 02:22:03.587]  You've heard about bunkers.
[02:22:03.827 --> 02:22:06.369]  But surviving is not recreation.
[02:22:06.569 --> 02:22:09.091]  And man wasn't made to live underground.
[02:22:09.331 --> 02:22:11.353]  Introducing Survivalist Camps.

[02:22:30.678 --> 02:22:31.719]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:31.799 --> 02:22:36.122]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:22:36.282 --> 02:22:41.905]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold before your retirement.
[02:22:42.005 --> 02:22:45.348]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:22:45.588 --> 02:22:48.129]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:48.249 --> 02:22:53.073]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:22:53.213 --> 02:22:53.493]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:53.513 --> 02:22:54.834]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:23:00.057 --> 02:23:06.282]  After 22 years of nutritional counseling, I've witnessed that a lot of illness can be linked to toxins and deficiencies combined.
[02:23:06.743 --> 02:23:12.788]  Improving your liver function and restoring your cells' ability to detoxify is essential to achieving radiant health.
[02:23:13.248 --> 02:23:17.151]  Listen to the real-world results of Doug and his wife after taking One World Way.
[02:23:17.431 --> 02:23:18.632]  My name is Doug Diderot.
[02:23:18.792 --> 02:23:21.635]  For years, I had an ongoing rash with itching around my eyes.
[02:23:21.875 --> 02:23:25.278]  This was due to metal dust particles landing on my face in the workplace.
[02:23:25.758 --> 02:23:31.980]  After being on One World Way for two weeks, I began to have a severe rash and itching sensation around my eyes.
[02:23:32.440 --> 02:23:37.422]  This rash and itching lasted for five weeks and is now 100% gone.
[02:23:37.862 --> 02:23:44.845]  Additionally, without extra exercise, I've also increased my muscle size and my wife has lost weight and gained a more attractive figure.
[02:23:45.365 --> 02:23:45.866]  Call 888-988-3325.
[02:23:45.966 --> 02:23:46.747]  That's 888-988-3325.
[02:23:46.767 --> 02:23:46.927]  888-988-3325.
[02:23:47.007 --> 02:23:47.908]  Or visit OneWorldWay.com.
[02:23:47.949 --> 02:23:48.890]  That's OneWorld, W-H-E-Y.com.
[02:24:23.172 --> 02:24:25.693]  Hi, this is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[02:24:26.133 --> 02:24:31.375]  Thanks to the good Lord, Catherine Albrecht has so far beaten cancer.
[02:24:31.395 --> 02:24:33.635]  And it's in remission, or total remission.
[02:24:33.655 --> 02:24:35.116]  We'll get details from her in the next segment.
[02:24:36.016 --> 02:24:40.718]  And I wanted to get her take on, because I know she's been talking about this, some of the scams out there.
[02:24:41.258 --> 02:24:42.718]  People claiming they can cure cancer.
[02:24:43.939 --> 02:24:45.859]  There are certainly things you can do that prevent it.
[02:24:45.899 --> 02:24:48.720]  There are certainly treatments that have shown they're promising, that are alternative.
[02:24:49.020 --> 02:24:50.481]  But when people say they can fix it,
[02:24:51.516 --> 02:24:53.397]  Well, I tell you, that is a lie.
[02:24:53.417 --> 02:24:56.900]  We're going to be talking to her coming up in the next segment about that.
[02:24:56.960 --> 02:25:08.449]  But getting into the whole NSA thing, Catherine, as you know, Reuters came out today and admitted, okay, they're actually giving it to local police for petty crimes.
[02:25:08.489 --> 02:25:09.750]  They're spying on farmers.
[02:25:10.411 --> 02:25:11.852]  Everybody is being watched.
[02:25:12.612 --> 02:25:20.819]  And then we've got Clapper and we've got Alexander and all these national security frauds saying, oh, we don't spy on you, even though it's admitted they're doing it.
[02:25:21.260 --> 02:25:22.621]  What do you make of all this?
[02:25:24.958 --> 02:25:26.299]  It's shocking, isn't it?
[02:25:26.419 --> 02:25:30.462]  And I think even now, Alex, we are just seeing the tip of the iceberg.
[02:25:30.602 --> 02:25:36.767]  This, just the little bits that are leaking out, the little bits that we're being told, the little bits and pieces here and there.
[02:25:36.787 --> 02:25:44.053]  I mean, Edward Snowden told us he kind of took the lid off, but now we're starting to see each little slimy thing crawl out.
[02:25:44.753 --> 02:25:48.476]  And I think it goes far beyond what we're even being told now.
[02:25:49.357 --> 02:25:51.419]  The amount of information that's being kept on us
[02:25:52.199 --> 02:25:57.061]  Even the information that's being kept on us in the private sector is mind-blowing.
[02:25:57.381 --> 02:26:02.983]  You know, I know you've been talking a lot about the show and on your website about some of the stuff I've been talking about for 15 years.
[02:26:03.003 --> 02:26:04.243]  You've been talking about it too.
[02:26:04.663 --> 02:26:10.506]  The fact that even in retail environments, the mannequins have cameras in their eyeballs that are watching us.
[02:26:10.926 --> 02:26:11.566]  The stores.
[02:26:12.146 --> 02:26:12.367]  I think so.
[02:26:30.189 --> 02:26:40.038]  Um, television screens, where they would have a screen up and it would say, here's how you prepare quinoa, or whatever, and then while you were watching it, the screen would be watching you back and determining your demographics.
[02:26:40.438 --> 02:26:54.911]  This stuff is, because it's invisible in a way, it's being built into the world all around us, and there's nothing more invisible than someone else's ability to grab a stream of bits of zeros and ones and capture your personal information going through the internet.
[02:26:55.311 --> 02:26:59.075]  So I think we are just beginning to see the tiniest little crack of it.
[02:26:59.115 --> 02:27:05.101]  I think if people really understood the immensity of it, it's like an iceberg is the analogy I often use.
[02:27:05.562 --> 02:27:07.964]  You see the little tiny bit on the top and you're overwhelmed.
[02:27:08.024 --> 02:27:09.466]  Oh my gosh, look at all that awfulness.
[02:27:09.806 --> 02:27:14.271]  If you could see the huge thing floating underneath there, capturing everything about you,
[02:27:14.831 --> 02:27:20.580]  You know, I'd like to finish that sentence by saying, if you could see it, you would do something about it.
[02:27:21.081 --> 02:27:30.175]  And that's really, I think, where you come in, where I come in, where Startpage comes in, where Startmail comes in, where hopefully every technology company out there that wants to
[02:27:30.595 --> 02:27:34.600]  Stay afloat during this time comes in and begins to offer things we can do about it.
[02:27:34.941 --> 02:27:38.065]  We need to work on this politically, socially, culturally.
[02:27:38.105 --> 02:27:38.946]  We've got to educate.
[02:27:38.966 --> 02:27:39.667]  We've got to inform.
[02:27:39.687 --> 02:27:41.469]  We have to train our children differently.
[02:27:41.990 --> 02:27:44.533]  We've got to take advantage of these alternatives out there.
[02:27:44.573 --> 02:27:47.056]  We've got to change or it's just going to be more of the same.
[02:27:47.779 --> 02:27:48.860]  Catherine Albrecht is our guest.
[02:27:48.920 --> 02:27:56.086]  Let's shift gears back into loyalty cards, what you first started exposing a long time ago, 14, 15 years ago.
[02:27:56.927 --> 02:28:03.893]  And now they come out in the Wall Street Journal, NPR, high-end stores use facial recognition tools to spot VIPs, charge you more.
[02:28:04.253 --> 02:28:08.196]  Websites vary prices, deals based on users' information.
[02:28:08.536 --> 02:28:10.798]  They charge people they think have more money, more money.
[02:28:11.139 --> 02:28:14.822]  Or if you visit, say, a yacht website, then when you go visit something else, they charge you more.
[02:28:15.322 --> 02:28:25.446]  I mean, this is what we're talking about, and then I am called evil for nicely trying to educate a Barnes & Noble person who tried to pressure me into taking one of their cards.
[02:28:26.046 --> 02:28:27.166]  That's evil to them.
[02:28:28.027 --> 02:28:41.271]  Well, they don't want to know that it's happening, really, because, you know, and what happens is if we don't educate people, then it's going to become the status quo, because when I first started working on shopper cards in 1999, nobody knew that the shopper card was collecting your data.
[02:28:41.771 --> 02:28:43.312]  And then I remember about,
[02:28:44.132 --> 02:28:52.580]  Well, maybe 2005, 2006, that I was talking to a 15-year-old girl, and she said, Catherine, I think it's really great you're doing protests and you're opposing these Shopper Cards.
[02:28:52.620 --> 02:28:54.761]  I really hope you win, but I just have one question.
[02:28:55.122 --> 02:28:58.284]  If you get rid of the Shopper Cards, how is this store going to know what you bought?
[02:28:59.125 --> 02:29:02.408]  And I went, oh my gosh, you are completely missing the whole point.
[02:29:02.448 --> 02:29:03.689]  But of course you're 15.
[02:29:03.789 --> 02:29:06.251]  You can't remember a time when they didn't have these cards.
[02:29:06.912 --> 02:29:12.216]  So the time to fight it, you only have about a 5 to 10 year window on any of this stuff.
[02:29:12.617 --> 02:29:22.065]  Because by the time it infiltrates society for 5 or 10 years, you've got 15 year olds who are going to look at you like you're out of your mind when you say that it's not a great deal.
[02:29:22.165 --> 02:29:31.210]  Absolutely, and they don't get that when everything's digital and everything's smart, as they call it, the globalists can hack it, control it, turn it off, control your thermostat, which they're now saying.
[02:29:31.610 --> 02:29:36.352]  I mean, this will make the nanny state literally go to the power of 10.
[02:29:36.552 --> 02:29:38.833]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, Dr. Kathryn Albrechts, our guest.
[02:29:39.254 --> 02:29:40.634]  We're going to take phone calls with her.
[02:29:40.654 --> 02:29:43.075]  Will you guys fire up my phone system for me, thanks, so I can see those?
[02:29:43.095 --> 02:29:45.076]  800-259-9231, and we'll get you up and on the air.
[02:29:50.882 --> 02:29:53.883]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.804 --> 02:30:02.207]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.768 --> 02:30:05.549]  Protecting your home with a security system is a must.
[02:30:05.769 --> 02:30:11.792]  But when it comes to protecting your family, your home, and belongings, there's no need to sign a long-term contract.
[02:30:12.152 --> 02:30:18.535]  Listen, there is some real scum in the alarm business cashing in by locking you into long, punishing contracts.
[02:30:18.935 --> 02:30:20.896]  Not with SimpliSafe Home Security.
[02:30:21.217 --> 02:30:22.257]  They're the good guys.
[02:30:22.558 --> 02:30:25.279]  You can trust SimpliSafe to protect your family.
[02:30:25.640 --> 02:30:29.942]  SimpliSafe was created by a Harvard Business School engineer, and it's revolutionary.

[02:31:02.435 --> 02:31:06.999]  There's a false sense of security that the greatest economic crash since the Great Depression is over.
[02:31:07.099 --> 02:31:12.965]  But unemployment is still at a 20-year high, and until Americans are working again, the economy has not recovered.
[02:31:13.065 --> 02:31:14.827]  What is the smartest investment you can make?
[02:31:14.987 --> 02:31:15.467]  It's food.

[02:33:03.769 --> 02:33:16.018]  You can complain about Big Brother and how this is a potential program run amok.
[02:33:17.062 --> 02:33:21.104]  But when you actually look at the details, then I think we've struck the right balance.
[02:33:21.124 --> 02:33:36.632]  And if people can't trust not only the executive branch, but also don't trust Congress, and don't trust federal judges, to make sure that we're abiding by the Constitution, due process, and rule of law, then we're going to have some problems.
[02:33:37.993 --> 02:33:39.734]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:40.134 --> 02:33:42.976]  Because there is a war on, for your mind.
[02:33:53.345 --> 02:34:03.991]  By the way, just north of Austin, a toddler was taken from her parents up in Round Rock, up in the satanic lair of Williamson County.
[02:34:05.558 --> 02:34:11.264]  Probably one of the most corrupt counties in the country, because it's got a bunch of well-meaning conservatives that think government is God.
[02:34:12.585 --> 02:34:19.211]  Another little girl got taken from her pot-smoking parents for pot-smoke, and then got her brains beaten out.
[02:34:19.732 --> 02:34:23.956]  You can go see the video of the little blonde-haired little girl, got her brains beaten out.
[02:34:23.996 --> 02:34:26.218]  Of course, nothing's going to be done to the people that did it.
[02:34:26.618 --> 02:34:28.060]  They'll probably get awards or something.
[02:34:28.080 --> 02:34:29.982]  They might as well have firing squads for kids now.
[02:34:31.049 --> 02:34:33.211]  Might as well oil police boots with baby blood.
[02:34:33.451 --> 02:34:36.674]  But don't worry, you're all gonna have your life ruined too.
[02:34:37.855 --> 02:34:40.298]  You're not being given all this satanic power for nothing.
[02:34:40.698 --> 02:34:43.421]  You're gonna be destroyed as well by your own system.
[02:34:44.101 --> 02:34:46.263]  So, enjoy.
[02:34:46.303 --> 02:34:47.645]  Here, let's scroll down to the little girl.
[02:34:48.846 --> 02:34:50.968]  There she is, but they got her.
[02:34:52.421 --> 02:34:54.182]  They're going to get more, don't you worry.
[02:34:54.202 --> 02:35:00.707]  60 plus percent of foster children nationwide are on an average of seven psychotropic drugs.
[02:35:01.728 --> 02:35:03.249]  When they cry for mommy, they drug them.
[02:35:04.970 --> 02:35:15.777]  And if they catch you with marijuana in your car, or you go in to get your blood taken for something, you go in to have a baby and they catch any marijuana in your blood, even if it's a false positive, you're never seeing your kids again.
[02:35:15.797 --> 02:35:20.981]  Because child kidnapping is worth a lot of money in this country.
[02:35:21.792 --> 02:35:29.217]  Just the federal funds they get to string your kid out on drugs and all the sicko pot-bellied pedos they pass your kid around to.
[02:35:30.238 --> 02:35:31.799]  Nobody's coming to help him either.
[02:35:31.819 --> 02:35:36.503]  No, only God's coming to burn this world up because it's what you want.
[02:35:37.529 --> 02:35:54.298]  All of you lovers of evil that won't do anything, all those kids in darkness all over the world begging for help right now, while the new world order tortures the daylights out of them, while you sit there and preen yourselves and all feel fancy and powerful and cool and all your sick narcissism and watch your sports center.
[02:35:55.999 --> 02:35:57.820]  Yeah, you're real manly out there, aren't you?
[02:35:59.944 --> 02:36:01.325]  Stories like that make me just sick.
[02:36:01.365 --> 02:36:02.786]  I can't even play the newscast.
[02:36:03.607 --> 02:36:04.528]  I can't even look at it.
[02:36:04.628 --> 02:36:07.130]  And I see them every day where they're killing foster kids.
[02:36:08.151 --> 02:36:09.231]  Especially little babies.
[02:36:10.412 --> 02:36:12.474]  They beat their brains out and never get in trouble.
[02:36:14.496 --> 02:36:15.817]  They lock them up in cages.
[02:36:16.077 --> 02:36:16.777]  They drown them.
[02:36:17.398 --> 02:36:18.058]  They rape them.
[02:36:18.078 --> 02:36:18.719]  They kill them.
[02:36:19.740 --> 02:36:20.760]  They malnourish them.
[02:36:23.490 --> 02:36:25.231]  Well, they'll be problems in the state custody.
[02:36:25.532 --> 02:36:28.234]  The most dangerous place in the world is in state custody hands.
[02:36:28.814 --> 02:36:31.236]  Catherine, I'm sorry to go off into darkness here.
[02:36:31.256 --> 02:36:32.858]  I get really depressed by this sometimes.
[02:36:34.359 --> 02:36:37.461]  I just hope all the evil people realize their party's not going to go on forever.
[02:36:37.762 --> 02:36:40.244]  What do you think about the increase in evil that's going on?
[02:36:40.264 --> 02:36:41.245]  I mean, it's definitely there.
[02:36:41.685 --> 02:36:42.586]  We're a cursed nation.
[02:36:42.606 --> 02:36:43.506]  We're a cursed world.
[02:36:43.967 --> 02:36:45.668]  Diabetes up several thousand percent.
[02:36:45.708 --> 02:36:47.190]  Cancer up several thousand percent.
[02:36:48.355 --> 02:36:51.977]  Everything that's going on, the test score is dropping, the IQ is dropping.
[02:36:52.277 --> 02:36:53.398]  What's happening, Catherine?
[02:36:53.778 --> 02:36:55.039]  You know, it's horrifying, isn't it?
[02:36:55.379 --> 02:37:00.982]  And you'd think that with all of this surveillance, that that kind of stuff would stop.
[02:37:01.682 --> 02:37:03.743]  But the reality is it's the other way around.
[02:37:04.023 --> 02:37:06.585]  The more of that stuff we get, the more surveillance they give us.
[02:37:06.645 --> 02:37:09.606]  And then the more of that stuff we get, and then the more surveillance they give us.
[02:37:09.746 --> 02:37:11.267]  And it's an escalation.
[02:37:11.928 --> 02:37:15.830]  So you're not going to find a situation where the more
[02:37:16.810 --> 02:37:19.792]  Surveillance we get, the better of a society we're going to wind up with.
[02:37:19.852 --> 02:37:21.212]  It's never worked that way in the past.
[02:37:21.292 --> 02:37:22.713]  It's certainly not going to work that way now.
[02:37:23.334 --> 02:37:29.757]  The people who are doing these kinds of things oftentimes are the very first to get on board with the nasty technologies.
[02:37:29.857 --> 02:37:39.022]  One of the things I did, and you know this because I was down in Austin visiting you guys there at the Infowars studios, but also I headed down to San Antonio and I interviewed
[02:37:39.662 --> 02:37:45.349]  A man who has worked with over 20,000 sex offenders within the state of Texas alone.
[02:37:45.369 --> 02:37:50.095]  There's a horrifying website where you can go online and you can see where they release these people out into the streets.
[02:37:50.556 --> 02:37:52.158]  And they're supposedly surveilled.
[02:37:52.338 --> 02:37:53.099]  You know, they're not really.
[02:37:53.139 --> 02:37:55.903]  They just give you a map so you can see where they are.
[02:37:56.743 --> 02:38:02.567]  And I interviewed this man who's worked with these people who've done time for their crimes against children.
[02:38:03.227 --> 02:38:05.428]  And what he told me chilled my blood, Alex.
[02:38:05.468 --> 02:38:18.976]  He said, you know that RFID tracking program that they had with the chips around the Kids Next down in San Antonio that you couldn't turn off, that was on day and night, that could read, that sent a signal outside their homes even at night when they were sleeping?
[02:38:19.716 --> 02:38:42.874]  He said that the people that he counsels, that they fantasize about technologies like that, that would enable them to select particular victims, and then drive down the street and see when they're home, drive down the street and see when they're at school, figure out if they're in their gym class... And that's right, and predators just like them built this to do that, and to be able to use the artificial intelligence to beat the good people.
[02:38:43.842 --> 02:39:03.946]  It's a mindset, and it's an evil mindset, and it's a mindset that says if I can get enough information about my victim, whether my victim is the taxpayers who I want to continue to fund my lifestyle, whatever that is, or if my victim is some poor innocent child who these depraved people fantasize about harming,
[02:39:04.506 --> 02:39:05.968]  Well, I think it's a good question.
[02:39:05.988 --> 02:39:06.829]  I think it's a good question.
[02:39:24.269 --> 02:39:25.849]  political groups that they opposed.
[02:39:25.909 --> 02:39:26.990]  You know, Tea Party groups.
[02:39:27.050 --> 02:39:30.310]  Groups that held different views than the prevailing power structure.
[02:39:30.730 --> 02:39:33.151]  And they said, okay, well, let's find out who they are.
[02:39:33.311 --> 02:39:34.891]  And how do you think they find out who they are?
[02:39:34.931 --> 02:39:36.512]  Well, they go on all these websites.
[02:39:36.572 --> 02:39:39.813]  They use all of this infrastructure that's being built silently.
[02:39:40.393 --> 02:39:41.413]  And that's how they figure it out.
[02:39:41.773 --> 02:39:45.454]  So, for example, you know, I can't tell you, Alex, the part that makes me crazy.
[02:39:45.834 --> 02:39:49.295]  How many people who ought to know better continue to participate?
[02:39:49.415 --> 02:39:50.115]  How many people
[02:39:50.675 --> 02:39:57.799]  Who, you know, I give speeches all over the country and I'll fly out and the person picking me up, you know, typically is the person who arranged the whole speech.
[02:39:57.879 --> 02:40:02.761]  Oh, Catherine, you've got to tell everybody in my group about, you know, this terrible stuff and privacy invasion.
[02:40:03.221 --> 02:40:20.070]  And then they're driving me back to either my hotel or to the conference center and they have a toll transponder on the windshield of their car and they just zip right through the toll booth and I have to stop and say, you know, that that toll transponder on your car is turning your car into a constant tracking device.
[02:40:20.450 --> 02:40:21.351]  Are you aware of that?
[02:40:21.491 --> 02:40:23.132]  Oh, yeah, well, I don't really want to go there.
[02:40:23.613 --> 02:40:25.514]  You know, it's stupid stuff like that.
[02:40:25.574 --> 02:40:26.695]  The people ought to know better.
[02:40:27.135 --> 02:40:32.900]  You know, if we were living in the Soviet Union, they would make you have that thing, and if you took it off your car, you'd be going to jail or to the gulag.
[02:40:33.220 --> 02:40:36.102]  We don't have to have this stuff, so why do we participate?
[02:40:36.443 --> 02:40:39.405]  It's the same thing, using Yahoo for your email.
[02:40:39.505 --> 02:40:46.731]  You know, as of June, we told everybody, we even did a press release through Startpage, we told everybody, your Yahoo account
[02:40:47.171 --> 02:40:47.952]  is going to be read.
[02:40:47.972 --> 02:40:50.913]  They're reading everything for, quote, abuse prevention.
[02:40:51.493 --> 02:41:00.838]  I've heard from people, and I'm sure you have too, I had one guy write me and say that his Yahoo account was suspended for 24 hours on, quote, suspicion that they didn't like what he was writing.
[02:41:01.559 --> 02:41:02.659]  You know, this is going on.
[02:41:02.719 --> 02:41:03.860]  Why are we putting up with it?
[02:41:03.900 --> 02:41:07.562]  And by the way, no amount of surveillance does anything because the evil people run it.
[02:41:07.602 --> 02:41:14.746]  This little girl, Alexandra Hill, and I'm showing a photo of her that makes me want to cry because I have two daughters,
[02:41:15.866 --> 02:41:22.069]  Uh, she would come to, they took the daughter because they found out one of the parents smoked marijuana.
[02:41:22.450 --> 02:41:30.654]  She would come beat up, bruised, starving to visitations, mildew all over, uh, and then they bashed her brains out.
[02:41:31.574 --> 02:41:37.636]  And the Texas Youth Commission is probably one of the most demonic in the country.
[02:41:38.116 --> 02:41:40.176]  And Williamson County is a feeder for it.
[02:41:40.716 --> 02:41:43.317]  Williamson County is a satanic group of people.
[02:41:43.697 --> 02:41:46.578]  And I want to just warn everybody, folks, do not go to Williamson County.
[02:41:46.938 --> 02:41:47.778]  Do not enter it.
[02:41:48.338 --> 02:41:50.259]  Do not take your children through it.
[02:41:50.739 --> 02:41:51.059]  Okay?
[02:41:51.539 --> 02:41:53.440]  And I just... I don't mean to digress.
[02:41:53.520 --> 02:41:55.420]  I just look at this story and this photo.
[02:41:55.520 --> 02:41:58.261]  They knew she was being abused in the government camp.
[02:41:58.821 --> 02:42:02.643]  They knew she was being abused by the devil worshippers that run this country.
[02:42:03.043 --> 02:42:05.305]  They knew she was being hurt and wouldn't help her.
[02:42:05.605 --> 02:42:10.107]  So the surveillance is there to make sure good people can't ever bring them to justice.
[02:42:10.407 --> 02:42:10.807]  Catherine?
[02:42:11.488 --> 02:42:21.173]  Well, I think you're right, because take a look at what happened when somebody found out that there was illegal activities occurring within the government, and I'm of course referring to Edward Snowden.
[02:42:21.906 --> 02:42:23.788]  You know, what did they immediately do?
[02:42:23.808 --> 02:42:30.975]  Did they immediately say, oh, thank you for pointing out the criminal wrongdoing so we can go address the problem and make it stop?
[02:42:31.075 --> 02:42:31.315]  No!
[02:42:31.495 --> 02:42:33.317]  They turned around and said, what?
[02:42:33.817 --> 02:42:39.323]  Revealing criminal activity is itself a crime and therefore now we're going to hunt you down.
[02:42:40.003 --> 02:42:41.945]  And, you know, that's the message across the board.
[02:42:42.085 --> 02:42:46.830]  If you had discovered that this little girl was in trouble prior to anything actually happening,
[02:42:47.310 --> 02:43:03.345]  You know it would have been a toss-up had you gone to the authorities whether they would have listened to you or worse yet if they would have gone on a rampage against you and now your records would all be under surveillance and under the microscope so they could figure out how to shut you up and shut you down and make you look like the criminal.
[02:43:03.865 --> 02:43:12.133]  So it's really it's a brilliant psychological and technological merger here where they make the whistleblowers into the criminals and you
[02:43:12.193 --> 02:43:25.242]  You know, there's not a person listening, and you know, every single person here, that you couldn't find something that you Googled, that you emailed, that you did, that you purchased, that you something, that if you slanted it and twisted it, couldn't be used to make you look bad.
[02:43:25.662 --> 02:43:26.923]  That's why they want all this data.
[02:43:27.423 --> 02:43:32.646]  That's one of the many reasons why they want the data, because it enables them to twist your arm.
[02:43:32.826 --> 02:43:48.014]  And if you think you're the only victim of it, every single member of Congress, I am guessing, has had their phones tapped, their email surveilled, everything that they do is under the microscope, so that if they ever step out of line, or if they try to vote in a way that would
[02:43:48.414 --> 02:43:53.077]  Not further the powers that be, then they can use that information against them and blackmail them.
[02:43:53.218 --> 02:44:01.103]  And you know, when you hear the stories, politician X was having an affair, you know, I especially am going to go back to the head of the CIA, right?
[02:44:01.183 --> 02:44:08.388]  So, you know, I mean, if there's ever a guy who knew how to keep his information out of the hands of the spy agencies, you'd think it would be him, and even he.
[02:44:10.070 --> 02:44:17.616]  I don't know who he crossed, I don't know what he did to make them mad at him, but I'm sure they said, listen, you play ball with us or we're going to take you down because we've got information.
[02:44:18.056 --> 02:44:21.278]  And they say that to every person within the highest levels of government.
[02:44:21.679 --> 02:44:29.205]  You play ball with us or we're going to take you down because we've got all your email and your passwords and surveillance video and footage and everything else of all your crimes.
[02:44:30.438 --> 02:44:35.059]  Well listen, here's an example of this family, father of a foster child who died, speaks to KVUE.
[02:44:35.399 --> 02:44:37.339]  We have the article up on InfoWars.com.
[02:44:38.079 --> 02:44:47.361]  Neighbors, they're not sure, somebody smelled pot late at night, their daughter's asleep, they smoked some pot, uh, watching a movie, you know, good hard working parents.
[02:44:47.941 --> 02:44:51.162]  And they came and took her, the kid, and a month later she was dead.
[02:44:51.182 --> 02:44:57.023]  And he describes going to see her once a week at McDonald's for an hour where they was allowed to see her, bruised up, beat up.
[02:44:57.983 --> 02:45:03.806]  Uh, you know, uh, mildew all over and they just laughed at him and then they, you know, then they beat her brains out.
[02:45:03.826 --> 02:45:04.747]  You know, that's what they do.
[02:45:04.927 --> 02:45:08.409]  And I mean, they're, and they're not gonna, I mean, it's just, it's so demonic.
[02:45:08.469 --> 02:45:16.313]  The government is so filthy and degenerate and all the police who were part of this and all the CPS workers, you're all got it.
[02:45:16.593 --> 02:45:17.753]  You're all going to hell.
[02:45:17.833 --> 02:45:19.234]  I'm telling you, there is a God.
[02:45:19.474 --> 02:45:20.314]  God hates you.
[02:45:20.594 --> 02:45:21.575]  I certainly hate you.
[02:45:21.955 --> 02:45:23.295]  And you will be brought to justice.
[02:45:23.315 --> 02:45:26.056]  This is a sick, filthy, degenerate system.
[02:45:26.396 --> 02:45:27.696]  And it's the spy system.
[02:45:28.157 --> 02:45:29.637]  It's the tattletale, Chris.
[02:45:29.677 --> 02:45:36.519]  What type of people would say they smelled pot, so then the CPS comes, and then why do you even let them in, folks?
[02:45:36.559 --> 02:45:38.000]  The government's not your friend!
[02:45:38.280 --> 02:45:39.560]  That's what I'm telling everybody!
[02:45:39.800 --> 02:45:40.520]  It's evil!
[02:45:40.860 --> 02:45:41.561]  It's evil!
[02:45:41.601 --> 02:45:42.481]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:45:43.467 --> 02:45:44.047]  Well, no.
[02:45:45.467 --> 02:45:57.170]  You know, the Bible tells us this, too, Alex, that as we get further and further into these crazy times that we're not only going into, but we're fully in, that people are going to turn.
[02:45:57.230 --> 02:45:58.570]  People are going to turn against the truth.
[02:45:58.590 --> 02:45:59.930]  They're going to turn against the Bible.
[02:45:59.950 --> 02:46:01.911]  They're going to turn against church.
[02:46:02.291 --> 02:46:03.831]  Parents are going to turn against children.
[02:46:03.931 --> 02:46:05.031]  Children against parents.
[02:46:05.511 --> 02:46:07.532]  We're going to see an increase in depravity.
[02:46:07.652 --> 02:46:08.652]  You walk down the street,
[02:46:09.292 --> 02:46:17.715]  And you see people wearing openly horrific blood dripping fangs on their shirts and tattooing it onto their bodies.
[02:46:18.275 --> 02:46:23.397]  People are really conveying this attitude of absolute horror.
[02:46:24.098 --> 02:46:26.018]  And we're going to see more of it.
[02:46:27.279 --> 02:46:29.560]  As things heat up, this is going to be the tip of the iceberg.
[02:46:30.080 --> 02:46:33.041]  And you had talked about bringing me on to discuss cancer.
[02:46:33.621 --> 02:46:41.405]  We're seeing this not only played out, this sort of increasing sickness of society is going to start manifesting itself physically, mentally, emotionally.
[02:46:41.826 --> 02:46:46.308]  People are going to start, you know, we're going to see that suicide rate, which is at record levels, going even higher.
[02:46:46.328 --> 02:46:50.591]  We're going to see the levels of illness hitting people younger and younger.
[02:46:50.711 --> 02:46:54.433]  Cancer patients being hit in their 30s and even their 20s now with breast cancer.
[02:46:54.953 --> 02:47:02.098]  You know, it's permeating our society because we're not only destroying the physical world, we're destroying the emotional and the social world.
[02:47:02.158 --> 02:47:03.499]  We're destroying the political world.
[02:47:03.519 --> 02:47:05.541]  Well, also, the natural order has ended.
[02:47:05.601 --> 02:47:08.583]  In the past, if somebody killed your kid, you'd go after them.
[02:47:08.603 --> 02:47:12.386]  And I'm telling you, there's this idea now, well, the state just kills our kids.
[02:47:13.066 --> 02:47:16.929]  And you've got them in the news saying, let's kill babies after they're born.
[02:47:16.989 --> 02:47:19.751]  I mean, we are just a demonic nation.
[02:47:20.188 --> 02:47:21.910]  Well, who's going to stand up for this little girl?
[02:47:21.970 --> 02:47:35.482]  Because you're right, a hundred years ago, had somebody bashed in the head of a little girl, her brothers, her uncles, her grandfather, her dad, somebody would have taken a shotgun and gone and taken care of business.
[02:47:35.522 --> 02:47:37.484]  I mean, I hate to say it, it's just, what would have happened?
[02:47:38.044 --> 02:47:40.966]  And at that point, whoever did that would never do it again.
[02:47:41.607 --> 02:47:47.771]  Nowadays, you know, we sit back and we hope that the proper channels take care of these things.
[02:47:47.791 --> 02:47:49.853]  No, they just bureaucratically cover it all up.
[02:47:49.913 --> 02:47:50.593]  It's what they do.
[02:47:50.954 --> 02:48:01.701]  Well, where you get into trouble is when the proper channels are the cause of the problem, or when the proper channels are turning a blind eye to the problem, because if you revealed the problem, then you'd probably lose your job.
[02:48:01.741 --> 02:48:02.462]  I mean, think about
[02:48:03.683 --> 02:48:17.194]  The immense sums of money that are being spent on social services, and if they actually came out and admitted that those social services were not working, then society is going to have to either dismantle them or kick them all out and start over.
[02:48:17.214 --> 02:48:18.214]  Well, Catherine, I'm going to say this.
[02:48:18.314 --> 02:48:23.358]  I see it in my mind's eye, my gut, but intellectually, stuff is already starting to collapse.
[02:48:23.519 --> 02:48:28.903]  I can officially tell people that society is starting to collapse, especially in America.
[02:48:30.905 --> 02:48:33.007]  I mean, do you agree with that analysis?
[02:48:33.547 --> 02:48:36.409]  I definitely feel something is shifting, and I think it's shifting.
[02:48:36.489 --> 02:48:44.656]  You know, I do a lot of travel, and the last couple of times I've flown this summer, I can't tell you how many kids have been alone flying on planes, like, across the country.
[02:48:44.696 --> 02:48:52.983]  I flew from Manchester, New Hampshire, down to Tampa, Florida, which is 1,600 miles, and there were kids on that plane, and, you know, the stewardess was like, where are you going?
[02:48:53.063 --> 02:48:54.484]  Oh, I'm going to go see my daddy.
[02:48:54.944 --> 02:48:58.367]  You know, a big part of this is that kids don't have families anymore.
[02:48:58.687 --> 02:48:59.288]  It's all over.
[02:48:59.328 --> 02:49:02.670]  I've been reading the Bible cover to cover, and I think it was in Ezekiel.
[02:49:02.690 --> 02:49:03.991]  I'm trying to remember exactly where it was.
[02:49:04.031 --> 02:49:04.811]  No, it was in Ezekiel.
[02:49:04.852 --> 02:49:16.100]  Anyway, one of the curses that God visited in the Old Testament on societies that turned their back on him, he actually says, your children will be fatherless.
[02:49:16.920 --> 02:49:20.022]  And I thought, oh my gosh, talk about the terms.
[02:49:20.042 --> 02:49:21.442]  Well, turn on any show.
[02:49:21.482 --> 02:49:24.084]  The message of the New World Order is dads are bad.
[02:49:24.404 --> 02:49:25.404]  Who needs a dad?
[02:49:25.424 --> 02:49:27.205]  Yeah, just go raise the kids yourself.
[02:49:27.265 --> 02:49:30.347]  You and your lesbian partner, you can form a household of your own.
[02:49:30.427 --> 02:49:41.472]  No, no, actually, you know, on the shows like The Fosters, it's the cop woman and the CPS worker, and they go harvest everyone's children, and the bad guys on the show are the biological families.
[02:49:41.929 --> 02:49:52.480]  Yeah, well, you know, more than half the time when they say missing child on the milk carton, it's a dad just wanting to get access, you know, to be a father.
[02:49:52.500 --> 02:50:00.789]  Well, it's families that have gone and gotten their kids back in a run and then they're on the news as terrorists because they don't want fat pedophiles raping and bashing their children's brains out.
[02:50:01.260 --> 02:50:06.623]  Well, and you've got to be careful when we hear about these, you know, Amber Alert or crazy whatever.
[02:50:07.364 --> 02:50:12.887]  Take a look, because it's very rarely an abduction where some random creep off the street just grabbed a kid.
[02:50:13.067 --> 02:50:21.012]  And more likely, you know, even the breathless headlines, when I click through and I look further and I actually dig down deep, what I find out is it's a parent.
[02:50:21.172 --> 02:50:21.512]  That's right.
[02:50:21.552 --> 02:50:27.234]  It's time to stop going along with the system, to remove our consent, to research cases.
[02:50:27.274 --> 02:50:30.795]  And we know it's innocent people running from the pedophile army.
[02:50:31.195 --> 02:50:32.235]  We have to protect them.
[02:50:32.395 --> 02:50:35.736]  I mean, it's just... Well, and part of it, you know, do your best to stay married.
[02:50:36.036 --> 02:50:36.316]  You know?
[02:50:36.456 --> 02:50:42.598]  We need to get our own acts together and be better people and be a little more patient, a little more kind and long-suffering for our kids' sake.
[02:50:43.766 --> 02:50:44.667]  Absolutely, Catherine.
[02:50:44.687 --> 02:50:45.028]  Stay there.
[02:50:45.048 --> 02:50:46.329]  We're going to give out your website as well.
[02:50:46.690 --> 02:50:47.891]  What's the best website for people?
[02:50:48.552 --> 02:50:51.475]  KMAShow.com is my radio website.
[02:50:51.555 --> 02:50:55.740]  And of course, we're big into StartPage.com around here, the private search engine.
[02:50:56.121 --> 02:50:57.983]  And StartMail.com is coming out.
[02:50:58.043 --> 02:50:59.525]  It's in beta, and I've got my copy of that.
[02:50:59.545 --> 02:50:59.925]  Very exciting.
[02:50:59.945 --> 02:51:00.906]  We're going to take a call.
[02:51:00.926 --> 02:51:01.307]  Stay with us.
[02:51:01.727 --> 02:51:06.309]  There's a false sense of security that the greatest economic crash since the Great Depression is over.
[02:51:06.409 --> 02:51:12.252]  But unemployment is still at a 20-year high, and until Americans are working again, the economy has not recovered.
[02:51:12.352 --> 02:51:14.133]  What is the smartest investment you can make?
[02:51:14.293 --> 02:51:14.773]  It's food.

[02:52:01.885 --> 02:52:05.348]  For over five years, you've been hearing about the Berkey guy.
[02:52:05.688 --> 02:52:07.509]  So you may know a few things about him.
[02:52:07.789 --> 02:52:14.034]  For example, you are well aware of the superior quality and effectiveness of Berkey water filters and accessories.
[02:52:14.475 --> 02:52:19.739]  But did you know the Berkeys have had independent lab tests done to prove just how effective they are?
[02:52:20.079 --> 02:52:20.559]  It's true!
[02:52:20.799 --> 02:52:22.621]  And he can email you the test results.
[02:52:22.941 --> 02:52:24.843]  Just visit GoBerky.com.

[02:52:50.083 --> 02:52:51.324]  GoBerkey.com, home of the Berkey Guy.
[02:53:01.786 --> 02:53:05.008]  Do you know what is the number one item to stockpile?
[02:53:05.868 --> 02:53:06.909]  Here's why I ask.
[02:53:07.569 --> 02:53:17.435]  We're in the middle of a global food crisis because of extreme drought, deadly disasters, and stupid decisions by those boneheads in the government.
[02:53:18.433 --> 02:53:27.921]  I found four warning signs that show that a major food crisis is on our doorstep, and we're just one more trigger away from a devastating disaster.
[02:53:28.582 --> 02:53:37.789]  And when that happens, or God forbid you have to deal with another natural disaster, do you really want to rely on FEMA to feed you and your family?
[02:53:38.290 --> 02:53:42.694]  That's why SmartPatriots have secured their own stockpile of survival food.
[02:53:43.354 --> 02:53:52.864]  Log on to stockpileone.com to see a little-known secret that instantly saves you and your family from natural disasters and the coming food crisis.
[02:53:53.505 --> 02:53:56.268]  Go watch my video at stockpileone.com.
[02:53:56.708 --> 02:53:59.171]  Again, that's stockpileone.com.
[02:54:07.984 --> 02:54:13.489]  Yeah, and most of the time when they kill these kids in foster care or in the state actual homes, they cover it up.
[02:54:13.549 --> 02:54:20.215]  In this case, because the little girl's brains were bashed out, they have arrested the so-called foster mother.
[02:54:21.056 --> 02:54:27.582]  But it's Williamson County that took the tip that people were smoking pot when they had a kid that came and did that.
[02:54:27.902 --> 02:54:29.544]  You murdered the little girl!
[02:54:30.285 --> 02:54:32.827]  And I don't care how many excuses you got, you did it!
[02:54:33.207 --> 02:54:33.748]  You did it!
[02:54:35.140 --> 02:54:40.843]  All these victimless crimes, all these excuses to break up families by you so-called fake conservatives up there.
[02:54:41.124 --> 02:54:44.105]  I know Williamson County, it's on record, is a bunch of drug dealers.
[02:54:45.646 --> 02:54:49.409]  You are a mafia that feeds on people and puts innocent people in jail.
[02:54:49.429 --> 02:54:50.449]  You're famous for it.
[02:54:50.850 --> 02:54:52.571]  Excuse me, look at this photo of this dead kid.
[02:54:53.131 --> 02:54:54.232]  This puts me into a rage.
[02:54:55.052 --> 02:54:56.013]  I can't look at it, man.
[02:54:56.413 --> 02:54:57.514]  I'm so sick of it.
[02:54:57.754 --> 02:55:00.635]  All the photos of the dead kids Al-Qaeda's killing in Syria.
[02:55:01.136 --> 02:55:02.857]  Huge piles of dead little kids.
[02:55:04.716 --> 02:55:11.821]  Our government's so sick they gave nerve gas to Saddam and told him how to use it, and then later said, oh, he's horrible, he used nerve gas.
[02:55:12.421 --> 02:55:14.083]  Yeah, working for you!
[02:55:14.563 --> 02:55:15.704]  You're not my government!
[02:55:16.164 --> 02:55:17.165]  And I'm sick of you!
[02:55:17.185 --> 02:55:19.787]  Bunch of murdering scum!
[02:55:20.467 --> 02:55:22.849]  And I know everybody isn't bad in the government, but it doesn't matter.
[02:55:22.889 --> 02:55:29.713]  When you see this stuff going on, you either say no and break with it, like that army MP we had on earlier, or you're part of it.
[02:55:29.733 --> 02:55:32.615]  We're going to do overdrive with Catherine Albrecht into the fourth hour.
[02:55:33.396 --> 02:55:34.476]  A lot of stations carry it.
[02:55:34.776 --> 02:55:35.217]  Some don't.
[02:55:35.237 --> 02:55:42.299]  You can find the audio and video streams at InfoWars.com forward slash show for the free video stream, audio streams, podcast, all of it.
[02:55:42.319 --> 02:55:47.561]  And I'm going to go to your phone calls, uh, Chad and Alex and John and Joshua and a few others.
[02:55:47.941 --> 02:55:49.741]  I want to talk to Dr. Catherine Albrecht.
[02:55:49.801 --> 02:55:50.722]  I originally got her on.
[02:55:51.602 --> 02:55:51.782]  About
[02:56:14.195 --> 02:56:28.360]  Beyond Tangy Tangerine 2.0, totally organic, non-GMO, they have a Clemson major study on how it is a preventative, doesn't mean you won't ever get cancer, but having all these trace elements and minerals is a preventative nutrition.
[02:56:29.232 --> 02:56:34.373]  Okay, so it's like, don't drink a bunch of Jack Daniels, chances are you won't have liver failure as often.
[02:56:34.393 --> 02:56:36.294]  Don't smoke cigarettes, don't get lung cancer.
[02:56:36.634 --> 02:56:38.094]  Also, get the right nutrients.
[02:56:38.474 --> 02:56:48.717]  Beyond Tangy Tangerine 2.0, available at InfoWarsStore.com, you can link through, or InfoWarsHealth.com, or InfoWarsTeam.com.

[02:57:11.129 --> 02:57:12.970]  Available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:57:13.371 --> 02:57:18.975]  The ProPure water filter so you can reduce or cut out, depending on what it is, all the garbage that's out there.
[02:57:19.275 --> 02:57:21.237]  The best gravity-fed filters anywhere.

[02:57:24.699 --> 02:57:29.940]  Promo code water at InfoWarsStore, one word, InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:57:30.481 --> 02:57:35.642]  And when you shop with patriots, when you shop with the good guys, it makes what we do here possible.
[02:57:36.242 --> 02:57:38.863]  And I'm putting in over 100% of our capital.
[02:57:38.903 --> 02:57:42.144]  I'm even spending backup money to try to expand in the face of the globalists.
[02:57:43.124 --> 02:57:46.105]  It's all I can do without going completely ballistic, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:57:46.825 --> 02:57:49.486]  And I'm going ballistic in the InfoWars best I can.
[02:57:49.526 --> 02:57:49.946]  I know it's a...
[02:57:50.586 --> 02:57:52.810]  Train wrecks sometimes, but it's real, and you know what?
[02:57:52.910 --> 02:57:55.373]  I ask God for guidance, and I'm doing the best I can.
[02:57:56.667 --> 02:58:02.049]  And the point is, is we need your financial support now more than ever to continue, not just to expand.
[02:58:02.650 --> 02:58:11.493]  And I'm trying to figure out how to do that, and I want to thank everybody that does spread our links, and does tell folks about the show, and that does support our sponsors, also our local sponsors.
[02:58:11.573 --> 02:58:13.174]  Support those on the local AM and FM dial.
[02:58:13.594 --> 02:58:22.378]  Spread the word about the broadcast, no matter how you're listening, whether it's in Las Vegas or Chicago, whether it's Austin or Los Angeles, whether it's New York or whether it's Tampa, Florida.
[02:58:22.858 --> 02:58:24.699]  Please spread the word about this transmission.
[02:58:25.592 --> 02:58:27.334]  Because I'm dedicated to a future.
[02:58:27.694 --> 02:58:30.597]  Humanity will never be perfect, but we're letting evil run wild right now.
[02:58:30.897 --> 02:58:33.499]  And government is the problem, not the solution.
[02:58:33.779 --> 02:58:39.224]  And if you built a business, you built that, not that stinking anti-human piece of trash president.
[02:58:43.768 --> 02:58:45.470]  Back in one minute with Katherine Albrecht.
[02:58:45.910 --> 02:58:47.972]  Take phone calls and we'll get into the cancer issue.
[02:58:51.568 --> 02:58:55.211]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us?
[02:58:55.431 --> 02:59:00.715]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[02:59:00.955 --> 02:59:08.500]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[02:59:08.680 --> 02:59:17.767]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[02:59:17.987 --> 02:59:24.975]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[02:59:25.155 --> 02:59:28.018]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[02:59:28.038 --> 02:59:34.985]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse but demand a war.
[02:59:37.841 --> 02:59:38.662]  State of Mind.
[02:59:38.922 --> 02:59:40.343]  Because there's a war on.
[02:59:40.483 --> 02:59:41.243]  For your mind.
[02:59:41.523 --> 02:59:45.526]  Get your copy of State of Mind the movie at InfoWars.com.
[02:59:45.706 --> 02:59:50.809]  And remember, every order at InfoWarsStore.com receives a free citizen rulebook.
[02:59:52.390 --> 02:59:53.550]  Coast to Coast.
[02:59:53.931 --> 02:59:55.311]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.972 --> 02:59:59.174]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:06.235 --> 03:00:08.477]  I refuse to go quietly into the night.
[03:00:08.497 --> 03:00:11.539]  I refuse to not have indignation and evil.
[03:00:31.067 --> 03:00:37.490]  I look at this case up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com where neighbors said they smelled marijuana, so the cops come, bust in.
[03:00:38.250 --> 03:00:40.891]  Good, hard-working parents take their little two-year-old daughter.
[03:00:41.592 --> 03:00:45.694]  She gets beat up, torn up, evidence of torture, abuse.
[03:00:46.994 --> 03:00:50.056]  They were trying to keep her up in the demonic Williamson County, but they do this everywhere.
[03:00:50.876 --> 03:01:02.422]  For marijuana, for recreational use of marijuana, and the judge that took that child and did it is just as guilty, just as guilty as the woman that they've now arrested and they're charging with beating the girl's brains out.
[03:01:04.263 --> 03:01:06.244]  Go ahead and make your excuses, you people make me sick.
[03:01:06.284 --> 03:01:08.104]  Katherine Albrecht, I'm sorry I went off on a jag.
[03:01:08.485 --> 03:01:12.907]  I saw this article, I read about it, I watched the newscast during a break, and it physically
[03:01:13.965 --> 03:01:36.138]  physically made me beyond angry and uh... but i guess that's a good thing is now i can probably work till midnight tonight without a break i mean it we need to work where is the instinct and i saw a commenter there in the comments saying of the founding fathers would've burned down all these facilities and hung all these people and i'm not calling for that but they're burning down our liberties how much of this are we gonna take?
[03:01:36.418 --> 03:01:38.079]  Katherine are you seeing all the cases now where the
[03:01:38.499 --> 03:01:40.681]  Where the cops will just shoot somebody for no reason?
[03:01:41.022 --> 03:01:42.003]  Just because they feel like it?
[03:01:42.023 --> 03:01:43.424]  And then they're being defended?
[03:01:43.704 --> 03:01:44.785]  I mean, this is demonic!
[03:01:45.386 --> 03:01:48.889]  No, we're getting to a place where human life is not worth much.
[03:01:49.550 --> 03:01:54.014]  And I think a lot of that is, I hate to say it, I think it's video games, I think it's media.
[03:01:54.435 --> 03:02:01.742]  I think it's the fact that the average person, by the time they hit 18, has seen hundreds of thousands of murders in cold blood right in front of them.
[03:02:02.462 --> 03:02:04.464]  And we're absorbing poison.
[03:02:04.484 --> 03:02:05.945]  You know, garbage in, garbage out.
[03:02:05.985 --> 03:02:07.006]  We're absorbing poison.
[03:02:07.046 --> 03:02:12.510]  One of the things I decided to do, I don't know, ten, more than ten years ago, was get rid of my TV.
[03:02:12.530 --> 03:02:13.190]  You know?
[03:02:13.330 --> 03:02:14.611]  Stop absorbing it.
[03:02:14.811 --> 03:02:22.677]  And it was amazing because not only did it stop all of those creepy feelings, you know, when you're home alone at night and you hear a noise or you're lying in your bed.
[03:02:22.817 --> 03:02:23.758]  I don't have that anymore.
[03:02:23.778 --> 03:02:25.499]  I don't have those awful nightmares I used to have.
[03:02:25.539 --> 03:02:26.360]  I don't have any of that.
[03:02:27.140 --> 03:02:32.382]  And the other thing, it also makes you not believe the lies, that there's a terrorist under every rock.
[03:02:33.142 --> 03:02:39.924]  When I travel and I'm in an airport and I look up and there's this CNN camera, it's always trying to scare you with something.
[03:02:39.944 --> 03:02:42.145]  And I look at that and I'm like, this is such nonsense.
[03:02:42.225 --> 03:02:43.085]  People believe this?
[03:02:43.545 --> 03:02:50.107]  But if you live on a steady diet of consuming that all day long, oh, there's terrorists, oh, you need the government to protect you.
[03:02:50.367 --> 03:02:52.407]  Well, you get into the fantasy land.
[03:02:52.567 --> 03:02:55.288]  It's like a three-year-old believing My Little Pony's real.
[03:02:55.708 --> 03:02:57.508]  But the adults really buy into this.
[03:02:58.388 --> 03:03:01.729]  Well, they do, because I think it's, in a way, it's reassuring.
[03:03:01.909 --> 03:03:05.210]  You know, that my own life is crazy.
[03:03:05.310 --> 03:03:06.410]  I've lost my home.
[03:03:06.430 --> 03:03:14.351]  You know, people are going through tough stuff, so as they think how terrible their own lives are, they want to think that there's some big, strong parent in charge.
[03:03:14.931 --> 03:03:18.932]  And I think that's one of the reasons they buy into all of this, because this argument that
[03:03:20.012 --> 03:03:22.333]  Homeland Security is going to keep you safe.
[03:03:22.453 --> 03:03:25.014]  Well, things may be going to hell around me.
[03:03:25.074 --> 03:03:34.436]  I may have lost my marriage, my home, my job, and my everything else, but at least I've got, you know, Big Mommy, Big Sister, Big Brother, Daddy out there looking out for me.
[03:03:34.456 --> 03:03:36.717]  And man, cake and bread overseas.
[03:03:36.797 --> 03:03:43.159]  Oh man, and liberals that believe in government are the ones that really get fed on by these CPSN people because they don't know how deadly it is.
[03:03:43.638 --> 03:03:45.479]  Yeah, well, exactly.
[03:03:45.499 --> 03:03:50.063]  And they're the ones who tend to want to go into that line of work and actually want to be part of it.
[03:03:50.083 --> 03:03:52.805]  And then once they get in there, they discover how corrupt it is.
[03:03:52.845 --> 03:03:56.548]  And the system either spits them out or they just conform to it.
[03:03:56.968 --> 03:03:57.909]  It's just like politics.
[03:03:57.929 --> 03:04:00.811]  You know, you get yourself elected on the local level, you can make some change.
[03:04:01.351 --> 03:04:09.213]  But getting elected on any kind of large scale, you know, federal level, you're either going to conform or you're going to get spit out.
[03:04:09.293 --> 03:04:10.634]  Unless, of course, you're Ron Paul.
[03:04:10.674 --> 03:04:16.576]  I think he's got some special kind of spiritual dispensation to be able to swim with the sharks and not become one and not get eaten.
[03:04:16.916 --> 03:04:24.278]  But everybody else, it seems like even with the best of intentions, they get out there and then they just become a part of the system.
[03:04:25.541 --> 03:04:30.484]  I agree, we're going to come back and take a few calls and get into the cancer issue, but we have to make a break with it.
[03:04:30.564 --> 03:04:34.507]  We have to decide we're against it and decide that's what we value.
[03:04:35.167 --> 03:04:44.914]  And stop going along with peer pressure when the peer pressure is not conformity to common law and a good culture, but conformity to a culture of synthetic death.
[03:04:45.434 --> 03:04:48.756]  A culture designed to rewrite humanity.
[03:04:49.176 --> 03:04:52.779]  A culture designed in the mind of Satan.
[03:04:53.519 --> 03:04:54.400]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:04:54.440 --> 03:04:55.862]  Dr. Katherine Albrooks, our guest.
[03:04:56.242 --> 03:04:58.725]  Your phone calls and more, straight ahead.
[03:05:01.633 --> 03:05:02.794]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:03.054 --> 03:05:13.500]  Myself, my family, the Infowars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[03:05:13.720 --> 03:05:20.623]  Infowars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats, but we can't do that without your help.

[03:05:32.187 --> 03:05:35.408]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[03:05:35.688 --> 03:05:41.329]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[03:05:41.829 --> 03:05:51.290]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[03:05:51.730 --> 03:05:52.891]  The war is here.
[03:05:53.211 --> 03:05:54.511]  It's an info war.
[03:05:55.111 --> 03:06:00.153]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[03:06:00.313 --> 03:06:03.495]  Great news, pure water lovers!

[03:08:18.490 --> 03:08:22.591]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:08:22.791 --> 03:08:29.214]  All right, we're going to your phone calls with Dr. Katherine Albrecht.
[03:08:29.274 --> 03:08:30.414]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[03:08:30.974 --> 03:08:32.835]  Let's talk to Chad in Florida.
[03:08:32.855 --> 03:08:33.495]  You're on the air.
[03:08:33.535 --> 03:08:35.496]  What's your question or comment for our guest, sir?
[03:08:36.838 --> 03:08:39.579]  Um, I have a question about biometric scanners.
[03:08:40.060 --> 03:08:46.363]  We just, uh, got one installed in work, and they want to take my fingerprint, and if they don't get my fingerprint, then I can't work.
[03:08:47.543 --> 03:08:48.564]  And I haven't done it yet.
[03:08:49.024 --> 03:08:56.027]  Fortunately, well, unfortunately, I've been off work for a, uh, injury, and I'm just wondering, how do I fight this?
[03:08:56.108 --> 03:08:56.948]  How do I stop this?
[03:08:57.250 --> 03:09:10.224]  I think you go to the top people in the company and you explain why it's dehumanizing, how the biometrics can be stolen later, how it's part of a plan to make you do that to get on the internet for internet ID worldwide, and as a tool of control.
[03:09:10.284 --> 03:09:11.525]  That's been the official plan.
[03:09:11.845 --> 03:09:12.226]  Catherine?
[03:09:13.277 --> 03:09:17.580]  Yeah, you know, it's hard once they've already picked a vendor and they've already invested in the technology.
[03:09:17.840 --> 03:09:24.644]  I have talked to literally scores of people who have contacted me and said, my company is doing something like this.
[03:09:24.684 --> 03:09:28.886]  Some companies have been doing, like, vein scannings or full hand scans.
[03:09:29.447 --> 03:09:32.429]  Now they're even talking about doing iris scanning in some of these companies.
[03:09:32.449 --> 03:09:34.370]  Oh, no, no, that's going in colleges and high schools now.
[03:09:34.850 --> 03:09:35.310]  You got it.
[03:09:35.370 --> 03:09:40.512]  Well, of course, because if you can get the kids ready to accept it, then once they become employees, they don't even blink.
[03:09:40.952 --> 03:09:41.932]  Then it's easy to scan them.
[03:09:42.433 --> 03:09:50.355]  So, this generation, I think, is the resistant generation, while they work on our kids and get them, you know, showing fingerprints to get food.
[03:09:50.415 --> 03:09:51.176]  Talk about Pavlovian.
[03:09:51.196 --> 03:10:00.399]  By the way, the Violence Policy Center about 12 years ago in the paper said, it doesn't matter what Mr. Jones does, when I caught bribery going on, they said in the paper, we've got your kids.
[03:10:01.429 --> 03:10:02.850]  That sounds just like Hitler, doesn't it?
[03:10:02.870 --> 03:10:08.153]  Yeah, but imagine exactly the arrogance of, we've got your kids.
[03:10:08.253 --> 03:10:09.734]  Well, that was Hitler's whole thing.
[03:10:09.754 --> 03:10:18.399]  You know, I don't care about you grown-up Germans, because I've got the Hitler youth, and we're Nazi-izing your kids, and that's all that matters, because that's the future.
[03:10:18.419 --> 03:10:19.639]  You'll grow old and die.
[03:10:19.679 --> 03:10:20.540]  Who cares about you?
[03:10:22.441 --> 03:10:24.022]  I wish I had a better answer for this.
[03:10:24.162 --> 03:10:30.827]  I have not seen too many people successfully go up against their company's policies on things like this and actually succeed.
[03:10:31.487 --> 03:10:41.714]  One of the things that I would recommend for really anybody out there, see if there's a way that you can work for a small, independent, privately owned, family owned company, or better yet, start your own private
[03:10:42.054 --> 03:10:55.270]  Yeah, we've got to try to only shop with small or medium-sized or family, regional stuff and then communicate with those companies and say, I want you to hire locally, I want you to be anti-Big Brother, I want to work with you.
[03:10:55.911 --> 03:10:56.371]  Exactly.
[03:10:56.852 --> 03:11:00.373]  Well, I think we need to be supporting those kinds of businesses that do the right thing.
[03:11:00.393 --> 03:11:07.595]  We need to be boycotting the kinds of businesses that treat their employees in this particular way and help to further this ugly thing that's coming.
[03:11:08.275 --> 03:11:18.418]  And, you know, I have to say, I've worked for myself or I've worked for private schools, I've worked for small, independent, you know, I've always kind of done my own thing and I've never been asked to do anything like that.
[03:11:18.778 --> 03:11:23.259]  I realize it's a lot to ask for people to think about completely changing, you know, their entire lives.
[03:11:23.439 --> 03:11:25.139]  Again, some will say, what's wrong with this?
[03:11:25.179 --> 03:11:25.860]  We're not bad.
[03:11:25.960 --> 03:11:30.661]  It's that the people designing the major architecture do have a bad aim.
[03:11:31.001 --> 03:11:32.962]  A total cashless society, folks.
[03:11:33.402 --> 03:11:35.862]  And ask why your churches aren't speaking out against it.
[03:11:36.143 --> 03:11:37.683]  Because they're on the globalist payroll.
[03:11:37.983 --> 03:11:39.143]  Thank you so much for the call.
[03:11:39.183 --> 03:11:39.844]  Great question.
[03:11:40.384 --> 03:11:42.404]  Okay, who's up next here, guys?
[03:11:43.204 --> 03:11:44.725]  Who should we go to next?
[03:11:46.345 --> 03:11:48.366]  Joshua in California, you're on the air.
[03:11:50.307 --> 03:11:51.428]  Hi, I have a couple things.
[03:11:51.968 --> 03:11:54.549]  One, I wanted to ask Catherine about Smart Mail.
[03:11:54.569 --> 03:12:03.213]  I remember a couple times ago when you were on, you mentioned that you were starting that up, and then you kind of just briefly touched on it, that it was in beta stages.
[03:12:03.774 --> 03:12:08.276]  I was wondering, when are we going to look at seeing that going into effect so that anybody can use it?
[03:12:08.877 --> 03:12:09.378]  I can't wait.
[03:12:09.418 --> 03:12:10.078]  I'm so excited.
[03:12:10.098 --> 03:12:11.760]  I just got my StartMail account this week.
[03:12:12.280 --> 03:12:19.988]  So we are currently in beta, meaning that 100 people internally actually have StartMail accounts, and we're emailing each other on them right now as we speak.
[03:12:20.548 --> 03:12:29.417]  Our next phase is going to be to roll it out to people who do QA analysis, quality control kinds of things, and then we're going to roll it out to all the beta testers who have signed up.
[03:12:30.337 --> 03:12:35.560]  I am noticing, I'm actually on the website, and they're probably going to kill me for mentioning this, Alex, but I probably should say it.
[03:12:36.500 --> 03:12:43.543]  We decided at an executive meeting last Thursday to shut down the beta because we have more people than we really, you know, I mean, we've got enough.
[03:12:43.603 --> 03:12:47.305]  We have 45,000 people signed up to be beta testers for Startmail.
[03:12:48.426 --> 03:12:52.669]  Once we close that, and we decided at the meeting last week we're closing it, it's going to go away.
[03:12:52.789 --> 03:12:56.332]  So I just now clicked up and realized that they haven't actually done it yet.
[03:12:56.392 --> 03:12:58.173]  So there's still time to slip in under the wire.
[03:12:58.594 --> 03:13:06.300]  If people go to Startmail.com and sign up and click the box that says beta, then you will be the first to actually get a three-month trial of Startmail.
[03:13:07.060 --> 03:13:10.745]  And kick the tires and get it before anybody else gets it.
[03:13:10.786 --> 03:13:12.007]  That's fantastic.
[03:13:12.067 --> 03:13:13.229]  I'm sorry, Alex?
[03:13:13.389 --> 03:13:14.711]  No, no, I was saying that's fantastic.
[03:13:14.751 --> 03:13:16.634]  Thank you, caller, for the question.
[03:13:16.654 --> 03:13:18.937]  In fact, I wanted to raise this since you mentioned it.
[03:13:19.057 --> 03:13:23.603]  Feds are suspects in new malware that attacks anonymity.
[03:13:24.204 --> 03:13:44.537]  And then it goes into basically, in this Wired Magazine, the Feds are believed to be loading on services, it doesn't mention Startpage, but it mentions some of the other groups out there on the company Freedom Hosting, hacking in and loading this to try to track people that are trying to surf with anonymity.
[03:13:44.937 --> 03:13:49.820]  And again, this shows this stuff works to do this, that they would be trying something like that.
[03:13:50.211 --> 03:13:54.573]  What's so cool about StartMail, Alex, is that it's fully PGP encrypted.
[03:13:54.633 --> 03:14:02.576]  So even if they were able to load something and capture the stream, it would take them multiple supercomputers, multiple years to decrypt even just one message.
[03:14:03.056 --> 03:14:11.479]  So this means that if you have StartMail, when you have your StartMail account and I have mine and I want to email you, I just check a little box that says encrypt this.
[03:14:12.219 --> 03:14:16.443]  And behind the scenes, it's some of the most powerful encryption ever created.
[03:14:16.724 --> 03:14:28.054]  And in fact, we're totally cutting edge because we have this new thing called Perfect Forward Secrecy, which means that if they actually devoted the time to get your PGP code decrypted,
[03:14:28.695 --> 03:14:32.419]  That they would only be able to read that one message, not all the other messages that you've sent.
[03:14:32.499 --> 03:14:35.282]  And we're the only company that's offering that right now on the Internet.
[03:14:35.302 --> 03:14:36.424]  So it's pretty amazing.
[03:14:37.265 --> 03:14:44.873]  But what it means is that if you have Verizon or Comcast or AT&T, we know for a fact that the government is scarfing up all of the data flowing through there.
[03:14:45.233 --> 03:14:50.099]  But if they scarf up an encrypted start mail message, all they will get is a bunch of encrypted gobbledygook.
[03:14:50.479 --> 03:14:59.122]  Even if they put a van outside your house and captured it as it flowed onto the internet from your residence or your office, they would still have to decrypt it.
[03:14:59.563 --> 03:15:11.647]  So it's extraordinarily powerful encryption and we've designed it specifically, one of the reasons that we got slowed down by six months is because of, well not six months, about three months, was because of the Ed Snowden revelations.
[03:15:12.528 --> 03:15:15.149]  No, no, I understand, you guys are really trying to create
[03:15:15.649 --> 03:15:18.490]  And I'm going to have you on about that, a full interview just about it.
[03:15:19.851 --> 03:15:20.851]  Something that really works.
[03:15:21.531 --> 03:15:23.172]  Let's go to some more phone calls here.
[03:15:23.592 --> 03:15:25.673]  Alex in Wisconsin, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:15:27.393 --> 03:15:29.694]  Hey buddy, great work today.
[03:15:29.834 --> 03:15:42.499]  I have three inquiries, but first, if all this is true, what you are saying, the big brothers, surveillance, spy ops, super computers with predictive algorithms and
[03:15:43.544 --> 03:15:44.985]  All the way down the rabbit hole.
[03:15:45.025 --> 03:15:46.206]  Well, sir, I mean, it is true.
[03:15:46.326 --> 03:15:47.427]  I mean, it's on record.
[03:15:48.027 --> 03:15:54.591]  Who have been strategically coded as part of their hack, and the best thing to do is curveball non-stop.
[03:15:56.812 --> 03:15:57.933]  Well, I'm not a hacker.
[03:15:58.033 --> 03:16:04.697]  I just know what the globalists and what top people say about the systems from, you know, just a general knowledge, so I don't know what a curveball is.
[03:16:05.978 --> 03:16:11.822]  Well, just like, um, make your lifestyle and your plans more erratic to kind of trick the computers.
[03:16:14.108 --> 03:16:17.552]  Absolutely, but again, they track mass movements of that.
[03:16:17.992 --> 03:16:22.457]  They put out this info saying, mess up the machine saying Al-Qaeda and bomb.
[03:16:22.957 --> 03:16:25.760]  Can I say something to this?
[03:16:25.840 --> 03:16:27.762]  Because here's the thing that makes me crazy, Alex.
[03:16:27.782 --> 03:16:29.384]  I've been doing this, as you pointed out, for 14 years.
[03:16:30.325 --> 03:16:51.726]  What makes me crazy is that people want to come up with really complicated ways to fight back and then they're the very people, and I'm not referring to this particular caller, but often times the people who are trying to find these far out ways to fight back are doing stupid stuff like having toll transponders on their cars, not paying for their groceries and their food and their basic necessities with cash, using credit cards,
[03:16:52.327 --> 03:16:52.607]  Thank you.
[03:17:22.367 --> 03:17:25.748]  But I feel like people are trying to make it harder than it has to be.
[03:17:25.768 --> 03:17:27.448]  You've got the answers right in front of you.
[03:17:27.488 --> 03:17:28.008]  Sure, sure.
[03:17:28.048 --> 03:17:35.350]  Just to finish my point, that's all a government disinfo op to say, say bombs, say Al-Qaeda.
[03:17:35.610 --> 03:17:42.351]  They put out this pressure cooker raid over people googling pressure cookers to make people think they're actually trying to stop terror.
[03:17:42.791 --> 03:17:49.713]  It's on record to make sure their money laundering operations don't get stopped, to make sure their criminal operations don't get stopped.
[03:17:50.526 --> 03:17:55.894]  to get corporate intel to feed to select groups to corner the market and that's all come out.
[03:17:56.274 --> 03:17:57.897]  So that's what the NSA does.
[03:17:58.137 --> 03:17:59.419]  They don't deal with Al Qaeda.
[03:17:59.639 --> 03:18:00.621]  They run Al Qaeda.
[03:18:01.021 --> 03:18:01.843]  That's on record.
[03:18:02.243 --> 03:18:03.986]  So, sir, I appreciate your call.
[03:18:04.547 --> 03:18:05.408]  But I do think
[03:18:07.014 --> 03:18:11.155]  That it's important to vary your life anyways and not be so stagnant.
[03:18:11.715 --> 03:18:12.335]  But I agree.
[03:18:12.415 --> 03:18:22.998]  Why do we then try to put superglue on our thumb so when we go thumb scan at the DPS they don't have our right thumbprint?
[03:18:23.578 --> 03:18:24.498]  Yeah, do that!
[03:18:24.958 --> 03:18:30.220]  But also fight to have it removed, pointing out it's being used for a global database.
[03:18:30.540 --> 03:18:30.880]  Catherine?
[03:18:31.553 --> 03:18:33.134]  Yeah, no, I'm totally with you.
[03:18:33.275 --> 03:18:41.322]  There are technical solutions, practical solutions, political solutions, and we've hit a point in our society, we've got to be on top of all of them.
[03:18:41.782 --> 03:18:47.567]  You know, even in my own community, I just read in the paper that they're going to start having roadside check, you know, stopping us.
[03:18:48.539 --> 03:18:52.504]  Which, yeah, I guess the Supreme Court said that they can do that.
[03:18:52.544 --> 03:18:54.086]  These are the sobriety checkpoints.
[03:18:54.667 --> 03:19:04.739]  But, you know, I'm already thinking, I turned to my husband, I said, I'm not going to roll down my window, I'm going to print out a little thing, and I'm going to have it in my car, and I'm going to hold it up to my sealed window and say, am I free to go?
[03:19:05.740 --> 03:19:07.681]  I'm not going to roll down my window, I'm not going to speak to them.
[03:19:08.261 --> 03:19:11.643]  And, you know, this is, it's resistance, it's legal resistance.
[03:19:11.823 --> 03:19:14.145]  I'm not required to roll down my window and speak to these people.
[03:19:14.185 --> 03:19:18.967]  But I asked my husband, I said, if I wind up in jail, are you going to bail me out, are you going to support me?
[03:19:19.007 --> 03:19:20.528]  He said, absolutely, I'll join you.
[03:19:20.988 --> 03:19:24.730]  Absolutely, and now they're doing stuff just like killing you as a punishment.
[03:19:25.411 --> 03:19:30.754]  I mean, this tyranny is very, because in Iraq they'll just spray a whole family on record if they look at them wrong.
[03:19:32.074 --> 03:19:37.578]  And the contractors will get naked and run to the streets shooting up people's cars for fun.
[03:19:37.618 --> 03:19:38.178]  That's come out.
[03:19:38.218 --> 03:19:39.419]  I mean, this is madness.
[03:19:39.839 --> 03:19:41.520]  Not saying no to government.
[03:19:41.540 --> 03:19:51.667]  We have the First Amendment and we have the right to free assembly and free speech and we can stand in a corner and hold a sign or we can talk back to the cops in a way that is, you know, legal and appropriate.
[03:19:51.847 --> 03:19:57.310]  And, you know, I'm not a big believer in being rude, so I'm going to be very polite as I hold my little sign up.
[03:19:57.551 --> 03:19:59.472]  But if I get stopped in a sobriety checkpoint,
[03:20:00.312 --> 03:20:13.241]  I don't want sobriety checkpoints in my town, so I'm going to resist on the individual level and then I'm writing letters to our local paper and I'm going to show up at the next city council meeting and I'm going to say I don't believe that this is appropriate in our community.
[03:20:13.681 --> 03:20:17.364]  So, you know, you've got to do things to respond to this.
[03:20:17.404 --> 03:20:17.684]  Sure.
[03:20:18.004 --> 03:20:19.205]  You know, there's another piece too.
[03:20:19.386 --> 03:20:22.109]  Figure out what streets they're on and don't drive on those streets.
[03:20:22.169 --> 03:20:23.971]  There's practical things that you can do.
[03:20:32.961 --> 03:20:33.481]  We're good to go.
[03:20:52.493 --> 03:20:59.857]  And Halliburton, and then XE, and before that Blackwater, and all the crazy things they get caught doing.
[03:21:00.257 --> 03:21:01.658]  No one will say no to them.
[03:21:02.018 --> 03:21:08.962]  There's no resistance to their tyranny, so they go crazy and do outrageous, insane stuff.
[03:21:09.002 --> 03:21:09.742]  That's my point.
[03:21:10.183 --> 03:21:13.384]  And so my question is, where are the people saying no to all this?
[03:21:13.504 --> 03:21:15.886]  Tom in Maryland, you're on the air.
[03:21:15.946 --> 03:21:16.326]  Go ahead.
[03:21:17.703 --> 03:21:22.927]  Hi, I just wanted to thank you for having the former soldier on your show today.
[03:21:23.027 --> 03:21:31.594]  You had a policeman a couple weeks ago who had won an award from a Sheriff's Association that respects the Constitution.
[03:21:33.176 --> 03:21:35.958]  I can't tell you how important I think that is.
[03:21:37.239 --> 03:21:47.067]  Also, as a retired police officer, I want you to know that my former colleagues and I, and many others, some that are still active,
[03:21:48.202 --> 03:21:55.327]  We took our oath to accept our duty to uphold the Constitution as a sacred obligation.
[03:21:55.827 --> 03:21:57.148]  That's written in Maryland law.
[03:21:58.109 --> 03:22:11.778]  And further in our oath was to accept that to defend the Constitution was the greatest honor to be bestowed upon any man.
[03:22:12.998 --> 03:22:15.400]  And I know there are those out there
[03:22:16.443 --> 03:22:18.427]  And believe me, we share your concerns.
[03:22:18.467 --> 03:22:18.928]  We see it.
[03:22:20.170 --> 03:22:21.693]  We recognize it when we see it.
[03:22:21.913 --> 03:22:24.959]  I don't know where some of these new recruits are coming from.
[03:22:25.598 --> 03:22:31.123]  But there's still plenty of us who do believe in that oath that we swore to uphold.
[03:22:31.163 --> 03:22:32.164]  No, no, sir, I hear you.
[03:22:32.244 --> 03:22:34.566]  And good police are just some of the best people out there.
[03:22:34.947 --> 03:22:35.807]  I know what's happening.
[03:22:35.988 --> 03:22:38.890]  The general population is going insane.
[03:22:39.451 --> 03:22:44.275]  And so you're going to have police that the public think are above the law that go even more insane.
[03:22:44.636 --> 03:22:46.617]  That's the historical paradigm.
[03:22:46.657 --> 03:22:48.039]  Catherine, any comments to what he said?
[03:22:48.621 --> 03:22:51.263]  No, I'm right there with you.
[03:22:51.483 --> 03:22:53.224]  I really believe in the rule of law.
[03:22:53.344 --> 03:22:57.166]  I just wish that we had more upholding of the law, to be honest.
[03:22:57.186 --> 03:23:04.250]  I mean, you take a look at Edward Snowden and the people he outed as being in direct violation of the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution.
[03:23:04.290 --> 03:23:05.351]  That's where I'd like to see
[03:23:05.911 --> 03:23:12.579]  You know, the people who've sworn their sacred honor to uphold the Constitution to step in and say, yeah, that's not legal.
[03:23:12.759 --> 03:23:13.780]  That's not right.
[03:23:14.361 --> 03:23:19.066]  So, yeah, I'm a big believer in the laws, and I'm a big believer in following the laws.
[03:23:19.106 --> 03:23:20.608]  I just wish we'd see a little bit more of that.
[03:23:20.848 --> 03:23:21.669]  Thank you, sir, for the call.
[03:23:21.869 --> 03:23:26.952]  I don't know if I can get to other callers like Ashley and John and Jason and Jan, because I skipped this network break.
[03:23:26.972 --> 03:23:29.894]  I've got about eight minutes left with Katherine Albrecht.
[03:23:30.555 --> 03:23:43.784]  Get into your experience with breast cancer, and I guess the term you use is full remission now, or correct me if I'm wrong, and then your concern, because all we ever hear is, you know, there are no good establishment treatments.
[03:23:43.844 --> 03:23:45.765]  And I think, you know, the
[03:23:47.381 --> 03:23:53.505]  I mean, statistically, they still are dangerous and don't work a lot of the time, but they do work some of the time.
[03:23:53.545 --> 03:24:00.430]  And clearly, the people out there that I hear saying, we've got a pill with some vitamins that will knock out your cancer.
[03:24:01.050 --> 03:24:03.271]  I mean, in some rare cases, it might be a good treatment.
[03:24:03.311 --> 03:24:04.252]  It might actually help.
[03:24:04.752 --> 03:24:05.673]  Undoubtedly, it helps.
[03:24:05.753 --> 03:24:11.297]  But we're going to end up killing people if we claim that there's some magic, you know,
[03:24:12.498 --> 03:24:16.260]  I mean, I've refused that advertising forever, or whatever.
[03:24:16.601 --> 03:24:21.765]  You know, these quack groups claiming they've got magic lightbulb machines and things that are going to heal people.
[03:24:22.338 --> 03:24:31.464]  Yeah, you know, I spent, first you know my background, I don't know if the listeners do, but I've got a doctorate from Harvard University, so I'm a pretty good researcher.
[03:24:31.484 --> 03:24:33.125]  That's the one thing that they train you how to do.
[03:24:33.806 --> 03:24:48.456]  And when you get breast cancer, and you get the kind of breast cancer that I had, which put me so close to the edge of becoming stage four that it was terrifying, then all of those research skills, I brought all of them to bear, my husband as well.
[03:24:49.236 --> 03:24:51.136]  He's also a Harvard-trained researcher.
[03:24:51.176 --> 03:24:56.997]  So the two of us really devoted ourselves full-time for about a year and a half to doing nothing but researching cancer.
[03:24:57.618 --> 03:25:07.819]  And we have every book, every tape, every video, every promise, every, you know, snake oil, everything out there as well as everything that the conventional world can do.
[03:25:08.600 --> 03:25:16.361]  And I asked him before I was going to come on the air today, I said, you know, honey, if there's one thing you could tell people who are going to be listening to this broadcast today
[03:25:16.781 --> 03:25:17.422]  We're good to go.
[03:25:37.856 --> 03:25:46.240]  But at least find out what they have to say, because to do otherwise is truly to bury your head in the sand and not to have all the answers.
[03:25:46.781 --> 03:25:51.023]  So I'm a big believer in marrying the two, which is what I did.
[03:25:51.503 --> 03:25:53.364]  I'm such total Ms.
[03:25:53.444 --> 03:26:00.968]  Natural, and I have a show on GCN as well, and I know about all the alternatives, and I never thought I would do, quote, conventional cancer treatment.
[03:26:01.388 --> 03:26:20.619]  But when I was diagnosed with cancer, I did the research and I discovered that I would be taking my chances of survival from about 3%, which are horrific, up to higher than 50%, and I believe now I'm up to 80, 90% chance of long-term survival of actually having this cancer not be the thing that finally kills me when I do go.
[03:26:21.199 --> 03:26:27.762]  So, that's all because I didn't just go to my local cancer center and say, hi, I have cancer, what should I do?
[03:26:28.522 --> 03:26:32.744]  I have sought out every possible alternative out there at every turn.
[03:26:33.705 --> 03:26:40.007]  One piece of advice I would give women, if you find a lump in your breast, first of all, run, don't walk, to get yourself a mammogram.
[03:26:40.508 --> 03:26:49.932]  If you do not have insurance, get yourself a mammogram under the, and you're going to kick me for saying this, Alex, but it's the one time I'm going to mention a federal program, is the Federal
[03:26:51.573 --> 03:26:55.338]  I'm going to get it wrong.
[03:26:55.478 --> 03:26:57.841]  Ovarian and Breast Cancer Screening Program.
[03:26:58.542 --> 03:27:08.675]  And what this is, is it's a program where if you don't have insurance and if you're diagnosed with cancer under the program, then the federal government will actually pay for your treatment.
[03:27:09.161 --> 03:27:10.922]  Now, I'm not a believer in any of that.
[03:27:11.142 --> 03:27:15.945]  I didn't, you know, didn't even have insurance when I got... No, but it's a loophole.
[03:27:15.985 --> 03:27:16.925]  People don't know about it.
[03:27:17.025 --> 03:27:18.846]  And, of course, I mean, you've gone over this.
[03:27:18.866 --> 03:27:19.687]  We'll have you on sometime.
[03:27:19.707 --> 03:27:21.468]  We'll do a whole hour just on it.
[03:27:21.668 --> 03:27:24.549]  But, I mean, you did all the alternative, you know, good stuff, the super nutrients.
[03:27:24.910 --> 03:27:30.052]  And what I found was... So, first of all, you've got to get diagnosed and figure out what you're dealing with.
[03:27:30.172 --> 03:27:33.514]  And then you can start doing the research on your own and figure out, is what they're telling me true?
[03:27:33.554 --> 03:27:34.315]  What are my chances?
[03:27:35.095 --> 03:27:43.600]  And if you do go conventional, which vastly increases your rates of survival, I mean, the evidence is iron clad, rock solid, indisputable.
[03:27:44.261 --> 03:27:48.363]  The only problem with doing the conventional chemo and radiation is it's really hard on your body.
[03:27:48.723 --> 03:27:50.884]  And so you can have long-term consequences from that.
[03:27:51.385 --> 03:27:54.827]  And that's really where I brought in all the alternative and complementary stuff.
[03:27:55.067 --> 03:27:59.770]  And the two, if I can just name the two things that have been the cornerstone of my survival program,
[03:28:00.290 --> 03:28:01.871]  They have been number one, curcumin.
[03:28:02.032 --> 03:28:03.993]  I know you've talked about it before on your radio show.
[03:28:04.434 --> 03:28:11.600]  Curcumin is the turmeric extract that has such a powerful anti-cancer capability.
[03:28:11.680 --> 03:28:16.283]  It's really cheap, you can buy it online, you can buy it from pretty much any health food store.
[03:28:16.303 --> 03:28:19.006]  Now that's what the health ranger says too, and we take it.
[03:28:20.286 --> 03:28:21.006]  You should take it.
[03:28:21.186 --> 03:28:24.407]  Anybody with a history of cancer or with cancer in their family should take it.
[03:28:24.727 --> 03:28:25.907]  You know what I do for my mom?
[03:28:25.988 --> 03:28:38.210]  I just have a crystal candy dish on the dining table and I just buy a jar or just a bottle of these things and I put them in the candy dish and I say, anytime you're sitting there and you're having a meal and you think about it, just take one or two of these things.
[03:28:38.250 --> 03:28:39.591]  They're powerful.
[03:28:39.831 --> 03:28:40.511]  And then what else?
[03:28:41.411 --> 03:28:46.736]  When they give curcumin to rats that have been bred to develop prostate cancer, they can't even induce it in them.
[03:28:47.036 --> 03:28:48.317]  It's that powerful, so it really works.
[03:28:48.337 --> 03:28:50.018]  It's amazing, absolutely.
[03:28:50.038 --> 03:28:57.124]  I mean, the big danger is going to kooks that have some lightbulb machine, and then you believe that's going to fix it, and then it kills you.
[03:28:57.404 --> 03:29:01.748]  You also go to some country hospital, they don't know what they're doing, they fry you, bad chemo.
[03:29:02.128 --> 03:29:07.073]  Certainly, it's got a bad prognosis, but at least it's got some history of knocking stuff out.
[03:29:07.153 --> 03:29:08.334]  Then it tends to give you cancer.
[03:29:09.054 --> 03:29:11.355]  Statistically, from what I've seen down the road as well.
[03:29:12.375 --> 03:29:14.276]  But only if you don't clean up your lifestyle.
[03:29:14.336 --> 03:29:17.497]  See, and this is, I just need to write a book because there's so many pieces to this.
[03:29:18.277 --> 03:29:20.018]  You've got to get the cancer out of your body.
[03:29:20.038 --> 03:29:22.178]  That's the surgery, chemo, radiation part.
[03:29:22.599 --> 03:29:24.339]  And then you've got to change the way you're living.
[03:29:24.419 --> 03:29:27.940]  And that's where all the alternative and holistic and natural and all that stuff comes in.
[03:29:27.980 --> 03:29:31.241]  Get more sunlight and more exercise and less stress and all the things we know to do.
[03:29:31.822 --> 03:29:35.183]  And I take 30, probably 40 pills a day.
[03:29:35.203 --> 03:29:36.003]  I'll have to count them.
[03:29:36.543 --> 03:29:37.804]  Yeah, you said two things.
[03:29:37.844 --> 03:29:39.304]  There's the curcumin and then what else?
[03:29:39.825 --> 03:29:43.506]  Um, the second one to get through cancer treatment is Coriolis mushroom.
[03:29:43.867 --> 03:29:46.188]  And it is such a powerful immune system booster.
[03:29:46.208 --> 03:29:46.588]  It's incredible.
[03:29:46.608 --> 03:29:48.509]  Catherine, we'll have to do a whole show on this soon.
[03:29:48.529 --> 03:29:49.329]  Thank you so much.
[03:29:49.349 --> 03:29:49.989]  That's in my whip.
[03:29:50.290 --> 03:29:50.590]  You bet.
[03:29:50.610 --> 03:29:51.450]  We're on the march.
[03:29:51.950 --> 03:29:53.531]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:53.551 --> 03:29:57.173]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.624 --> 03:30:02.806]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[03:30:03.066 --> 03:30:13.520]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[03:30:13.740 --> 03:30:16.384]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight
[03:30:16.544 --> 03:30:17.004]  We're good to go.
[03:30:32.193 --> 03:30:35.438]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[03:30:35.679 --> 03:30:41.307]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[03:30:41.828 --> 03:30:46.876]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of...
