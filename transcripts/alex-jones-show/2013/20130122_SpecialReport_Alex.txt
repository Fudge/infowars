[00:00:09.955 --> 00:00:21.163]  On January 19, 2013, citizens across the United States joined together at their respective Capitol buildings to protest the Obama Administration's 23 executive gun control actions.
[00:00:21.883 --> 00:00:23.324]  Texas was no exception.
[00:00:23.865 --> 00:00:28.208]  Now Sheriff, people don't seem to understand the significance of Sheriffs speaking up in their communities.
[00:00:28.728 --> 00:00:29.629]  Why should Sheriffs speak up?
[00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:32.571]  Well, because they're the last line of defense in their counties.
[00:00:33.197 --> 00:00:36.400]  And they work directly for the people, and they are the last line of defense.
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.662]  They are the ultimate protector of the people.
[00:00:39.122 --> 00:00:43.526]  They promised, when they took their oath and when they took their job, to protect the people's rights.
[00:00:44.047 --> 00:00:48.971]  And now we have sheriffs all over the country doing that, and that's exactly what every one of them promised to do.
[00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:52.755]  Now, did you get the turnout and the response you were expecting today?
[00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:54.169]  Oh, man.
[00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:55.690]  This was fantastic.
[00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.752]  I have to tell you, we really missed Alex here today.
[00:00:57.992 --> 00:00:59.052]  It was a great crowd.
[00:00:59.873 --> 00:01:01.814]  Maybe two to 2,500 people.
[00:01:02.875 --> 00:01:09.839]  It was just jam-packed with people who are dedicated to the holy cause of liberty, as Patrick Henry called it.
[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.921]  And my voice is already going.
[00:01:11.961 --> 00:01:13.361]  I've been talking all afternoon.
[00:01:14.022 --> 00:01:17.464]  And I really believe that we can turn this around.
[00:01:17.524 --> 00:01:18.945]  But back to your sheriff comment.
[00:01:19.383 --> 00:01:26.311]  We're going to need local officials, especially sheriffs, to tell the federal government there's just a few things you're not going to do in our county.
[00:01:26.771 --> 00:01:28.813]  And one of them is gun control.
[00:01:29.374 --> 00:01:30.235]  It's against the law.
[00:01:30.655 --> 00:01:35.440]  And so as a lawman, the sheriff has to oppose such lawlessness.
[00:01:35.841 --> 00:01:36.822]  He promised he would.
[00:01:37.563 --> 00:01:38.964]  And so I think it's wonderful.
[00:01:38.984 --> 00:01:41.006]  We're seeing sheriffs from California to Georgia.
[00:01:41.847 --> 00:01:47.489]  And Texas to Montana standing against what Barack Obama is trying to do to take our guns.
[00:01:48.269 --> 00:01:49.389]  And you know what?
[00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.130]  This is the spirit of 1776.
[00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.430]  And Alex got it right when he said that.
[00:01:54.891 --> 00:01:57.851]  This is still here and freedom is just as important today.
[00:01:58.432 --> 00:02:02.613]  And right now, I have to tell you, they were kind of hinting at it at the rally today.
[00:02:03.333 --> 00:02:07.514]  But this is the most critical time in American history since the Civil War.
[00:02:08.117 --> 00:02:15.279]  Now that's my quote, but if you take what everybody was saying today and what the people here were feeling, this is it.
[00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:18.620]  And we've got to take a stand now so that we can avoid the fight later.
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.121]  Now Sheriff, you're going to get a lot of comments saying, oh, he's just saying you don't need an assault weapon.
[00:02:24.161 --> 00:02:26.641]  He's just saying you don't need more than 10 rounds in your magazine.
[00:02:26.681 --> 00:02:27.862]  So what's your retort to that?
[00:02:29.485 --> 00:02:39.071]  Barack Obama, let me tell you right now, you have no authority to tell me what kind of gun I can own, how big of a clip I can own, or even if I have to go through your stupid background checks.
[00:02:39.691 --> 00:02:41.992]  All those, sir, are infringements!
[00:02:42.553 --> 00:02:46.695]  And I'll own whatever kind of gun I want, and it's none of your damn business!
[00:02:47.095 --> 00:02:51.318]  Stay in Washington, or go back to Kenya where you're from, and leave us the hell alone!
[00:02:51.786 --> 00:02:58.749]  Well, Sheriff, we just heard a little bit ago that in Massachusetts the government wants you to store your gun in a safe, government-approved location.
[00:02:58.909 --> 00:02:59.569]  What do you say to that?
[00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:06.692]  That is so absurd that if I ever needed it as a cop, so I can't take my gun home when I'm a cop?
[00:03:07.312 --> 00:03:08.052]  How about cops?
[00:03:08.833 --> 00:03:11.694]  Who bestows all power in America?
[00:03:12.394 --> 00:03:14.415]  Don't they teach that in schools in Massachusetts?
[00:03:14.455 --> 00:03:15.075]  What's the problem?
[00:03:15.676 --> 00:03:18.757]  In America, gun control is against the law.
[00:03:19.765 --> 00:03:22.846]  And, in America, we the people bestow all power.
[00:03:23.447 --> 00:03:28.269]  How is it that that congressman tells us now how we have to keep and bear arms?
[00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:29.629]  Are you crazy?
[00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:31.790]  No, we don't do that.
[00:03:32.511 --> 00:03:40.714]  In New York, police are not exempt, or at least not yet, from this ridiculous seven rounds in your magazine, Magazine Law.
[00:03:41.094 --> 00:03:46.877]  Now, they're trying to push, and I'm sure they will get that changed for active duty police, but even retired police officers are saying that they need
[00:03:54.637 --> 00:04:01.123]  They don't, but they keep trying to make this elitism go nationwide.
[00:04:01.684 --> 00:04:04.186]  And who loves elitism more than Washington D.C.
[00:04:04.246 --> 00:04:04.827]  politicians?
[00:04:04.847 --> 00:04:09.371]  So, they're trying to spread it around the country and try to get cops involved with it, some of it.
[00:04:09.911 --> 00:04:12.414]  But I really love the New York cops who know and understand
[00:04:12.814 --> 00:04:15.856]  Then an armed citizen is better protected than one who is not.
[00:04:16.517 --> 00:04:33.488]  And there's a lot of cops, and we're hearing from even at least one sheriff and some of the cops in the state of New York, and even in New York City, where they believe the gun control promoted by Cuomo and Bloomberg are not what they want.
[00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:37.211]  And so it's time to have this grassroots swell of
[00:04:39.306 --> 00:04:40.846]  A revolution, if you will.
[00:04:41.506 --> 00:04:42.167]  And peacefully.
[00:04:42.527 --> 00:04:43.307]  And peacefully so.
[00:04:43.747 --> 00:04:51.829]  It's time to tell these public officials and these poly-magicians, as the name I call them, tell them to get out of the way, get out of our lives.
[00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:53.429]  We'll run our own families.
[00:04:53.829 --> 00:04:55.749]  We'll run our own lives.
[00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.190]  And we'll own whatever gun we want.
[00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.911]  And unless we commit a crime, you, sir, have to leave us alone.
[00:05:04.731 --> 00:05:05.772]  One last question, Sheriff.
[00:05:05.972 --> 00:05:07.852]  How do you feel about gun-free zones in schools?
[00:05:08.857 --> 00:05:09.638]  Gun-free zones.
[00:05:09.818 --> 00:05:13.220]  That's probably the stupidest thing that we ever came up with.
[00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:21.285]  As a law enforcement professional, you really think that because we put a sign in front of your school that it's a gun-free zone, that that is going to make it so?
[00:05:22.225 --> 00:05:28.169]  And that we tell every lunatic and pedophile and drug dealer that all our schools are gun-free zones.
[00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:29.389]  Come in and do whatever you want.
[00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.811]  How lunatic can we be?
