[00:00:05.782 --> 00:00:09.944]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.605 --> 00:00:11.405]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.185 --> 00:00:13.146]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.746 --> 00:00:17.368]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.928 --> 00:00:21.991]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.568 --> 00:00:36.529]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us.
[00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:41.153]  It is Thursday, the 25th day of July 2013.
[00:00:41.353 --> 00:00:46.236]  With little argument, the House of Representatives has limited U.S.
[00:00:46.776 --> 00:00:52.920]  military involvement in Syria and Egypt, but at the same time actually authorized it.
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.544]  It's like we're limiting torture to authorize it in certain cases.
[00:00:58.604 --> 00:01:02.587]  We're limiting NSA snooping to authorize NSA snooping.
[00:01:04.022 --> 00:01:05.402]  So we're going to be breaking some of that down.
[00:01:05.442 --> 00:01:09.164]  The House rejects bid to curb spy agency data collection.
[00:01:09.184 --> 00:01:16.706]  So that's Congress who tried to turn a blind eye to this for a while, didn't want to be told about it even though they'd already authorized it decades ago.
[00:01:18.206 --> 00:01:21.907]  They knew it was unconstitutional so they didn't want to have a public debate about it.
[00:01:22.187 --> 00:01:24.148]  Well now that's been forced and they have voted
[00:01:25.954 --> 00:01:42.282]  In the House, we've got a list of the bipartisan traders to allow the private-controlled NSA, that literally works for foreign offshore banks, to use this data in economic sabotage against America as part of a corporate takeover via Agenda 21.
[00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.991]  So we're going to be going over all of that.
[00:01:47.032 --> 00:01:53.039]  And also a Bloomberg Businessweek article, Homeland Security Future Home, a former mental hospital.
[00:01:53.379 --> 00:02:05.812]  And as soon as I saw the name of this this morning, I went and searched its name and MKUltra and its name and major abuses and dungeons and huge mind control facilities.
[00:02:05.852 --> 00:02:06.313]  That's right.
[00:02:07.998 --> 00:02:08.418]  The St.
[00:02:08.478 --> 00:02:19.683]  Elizabeth Hospital, they're building a gigantic $4.5 billion headquarters onto the back of it.
[00:02:19.703 --> 00:02:23.445]  $4.5 billion for the new Ministry of Truth.
[00:02:23.865 --> 00:02:26.206]  Why not have it be a giant white pyramid?
[00:02:27.065 --> 00:02:28.926]  Like the Ministry of Love.
[00:02:29.466 --> 00:02:33.909]  Why not just call it, I mean they already call it Homeland Security, Reich Security, Land Security.
[00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:35.850]  Russia called it Fatherland.
[00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.252]  Nazi Germany called it Fatherland.
[00:02:38.792 --> 00:02:44.815]  Every fascist or authoritarian system calls it The Land, The Homeland, Und Homeland.
[00:02:46.476 --> 00:02:49.518]  Why not just go all the way and call it the Ministry of Love?
[00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:52.300]  A big pyramidal torture facility.
[00:02:53.632 --> 00:02:56.895]  Where they've done forced electroshock, torture, you name it.
[00:02:57.615 --> 00:02:58.796]  This is the facility.
[00:02:58.816 --> 00:03:01.438]  And you notice who the globalists hire to be their torturers?
[00:03:01.538 --> 00:03:05.402]  It's sicko federal jail guards that have histories of rape and torture.
[00:03:06.302 --> 00:03:06.763]  Look it up.
[00:03:07.383 --> 00:03:08.924]  They hired for Abu Ghraib to run things.
[00:03:09.665 --> 00:03:11.547]  And sicko psychiatrists.
[00:03:12.707 --> 00:03:18.152]  Sicko control freaks that got into psychiatry so they could manipulate people.
[00:03:18.232 --> 00:03:20.334]  So they are taking a famous
[00:03:22.182 --> 00:03:27.566]  Government Hospital for the Insane that has been around since before the Civil War.
[00:03:27.626 --> 00:03:29.408]  I mean, you talk about secrets within secrets.
[00:03:30.308 --> 00:03:36.173]  And it also held animals in it.
[00:03:36.213 --> 00:03:39.956]  It was a zoological research facility.
[00:03:40.256 --> 00:03:48.422]  This is a New World Order command base of ultimate wickedness that makes Dr. Mingala literally look like a piker.
[00:03:53.303 --> 00:03:59.945]  Absolutely insane, ladies and gentlemen, that an MKUltra facility is now where you're going to have.
[00:04:00.526 --> 00:04:04.567]  And by the way, that's something for my writers to look into, because I know about this facility.
[00:04:04.587 --> 00:04:05.167]  It's very famous.
[00:04:05.627 --> 00:04:07.108]  MKUltra doctors were there.
[00:04:07.528 --> 00:04:18.992]  Search Jolly and West's name, Dr. Ewing Cameron's name, and other MKUltra, MKNaomi, MKXRay, and other programs that got declassified in the 70s.
[00:04:19.412 --> 00:04:21.013]  Search it along the name of
[00:04:22.421 --> 00:04:22.641]  St.
[00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:26.162]  Elizabeth Hospital to get the rest of the story.
[00:04:26.542 --> 00:04:30.623]  Search involuntary commitment and electroconvulsive therapy.
[00:04:33.164 --> 00:04:33.924]  Very loving.
[00:04:34.724 --> 00:04:37.385]  And torture, rape, you name it.
[00:04:37.425 --> 00:04:42.006]  Let's have an article about them picking this particularly happy abode.
[00:04:43.607 --> 00:04:47.768]  Like in all the fairy tales where the wicked witch lives in some deep dark torture dungeon.
[00:04:50.268 --> 00:04:56.099]  Ah, but Big Sis, now wearing a muzzle, is being sent to be a toilet attendant out in California.
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.603]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, stay with us.
[00:05:02.725 --> 00:05:04.386]  And you're subject to other police action.
[00:05:05.207 --> 00:05:06.107]  Tyranny is here.
[00:05:06.468 --> 00:05:10.150]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:12.612]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:05:12.632 --> 00:05:18.095]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:05:18.496 --> 00:05:24.740]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:30.704]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:05:31.145 --> 00:05:34.807]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:05:35.328 --> 00:05:39.311]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:05:39.611 --> 00:05:45.115]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:05:45.555 --> 00:05:48.537]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:05:49.118 --> 00:05:50.539]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:05:51.079 --> 00:05:51.520]  It's here.
[00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:59.013]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:06:01.104 --> 00:06:02.285]  What does freedom mean to you?
[00:06:02.345 --> 00:06:05.247]  How about the freedom to take control of your own future?
[00:06:05.508 --> 00:06:09.010]  At eFoods Direct, we're again celebrating Food Freedom Month.
[00:06:09.331 --> 00:06:18.458]  In July, for every $329 you spend on our highly nutritious, great-tasting food, you will receive a $190 Patriot Pack free.
[00:06:18.718 --> 00:06:23.302]  For example, purchase a six-month supply and get three Patriot Packs free.
[00:06:23.542 --> 00:06:29.727]  The Patriot Pack is a 24-day supply of eFoods Quick Fix Easy-to-Store Food plus Stove,
[00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:33.119]  I think so.
[00:07:01.085 --> 00:07:04.728]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us?
[00:07:04.968 --> 00:07:10.233]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[00:07:10.473 --> 00:07:18.019]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[00:07:18.219 --> 00:07:27.306]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[00:07:27.506 --> 00:07:34.528]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[00:07:34.688 --> 00:07:37.549]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[00:07:37.569 --> 00:07:44.491]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse, but demand a war.
[00:07:45.111 --> 00:07:46.091]  Oh, there's another one!
[00:07:46.112 --> 00:07:47.072]  Another plane just hit!
[00:08:11.075 --> 00:08:16.136]  The Alex Jones Show, because there is a war on for your mind.
[00:08:23.599 --> 00:08:27.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, again thank you so much for joining us on
[00:08:28.649 --> 00:08:31.230]  This Thursday edition, the 25th day of July, 2013.
[00:08:34.592 --> 00:08:38.833]  I already had Eric Mankow Muller, who's got a hit.
[00:08:38.974 --> 00:08:46.217]  I mean, it's got like four or five million viewers per premiere on History Channel with his show.
[00:08:47.642 --> 00:08:49.083]  That is extremely popular.
[00:08:50.464 --> 00:08:52.305]  God, guns and automobiles.
[00:08:53.126 --> 00:09:05.695]  We're going to have him popping in at the bottom of the hour to talk about how Media Matters and other White House run groups tried to not let that show go on the air because the word God in the name.
[00:09:06.539 --> 00:09:15.142]  And then, yesterday, the Toronto Health Department came out and said, ABC News, please don't... In fact, guys, will you reprint me the article?
[00:09:15.162 --> 00:09:16.422]  I know it came out yesterday afternoon.
[00:09:16.442 --> 00:09:17.362]  I don't have it here on the stack.
[00:09:17.402 --> 00:09:17.742]  Thank you.
[00:09:18.783 --> 00:09:33.747]  The Toronto Health Department came out and said, the Canadian Health Authorities came out and asked ABC to reconsider Jenny McCarthy and said that she will cause undue deaths by her vaccine misinformation.
[00:09:35.316 --> 00:09:39.379]  Of course, they gave no proof of that, but they just demonized her.
[00:09:39.399 --> 00:09:45.884]  You've got other big pharma groups here in the United States trying to keep her off the air, even though she's not going to be talking about stuff like that on air, obviously.
[00:09:46.885 --> 00:09:47.906]  Her son was damaged.
[00:09:48.566 --> 00:09:49.767]  She went and investigated it.
[00:09:49.827 --> 00:09:54.150]  There's massive evidence linking vaccines to autism, autoimmune diseases, you name it.
[00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:56.792]  It's a cocktail of other contributing factors as well.
[00:09:57.112 --> 00:09:58.954]  Dangerous pesticides, GMO.
[00:09:59.674 --> 00:10:00.255]  It's Legion.
[00:10:01.533 --> 00:10:02.193]  What's going on?
[00:10:02.233 --> 00:10:07.154]  They put out hoaxes trying to discredit people like Dr. Wakefield saying he hoaxed.
[00:10:07.494 --> 00:10:08.595]  He sued the doctor.
[00:10:09.035 --> 00:10:10.375]  It's moving forward in court.
[00:10:10.415 --> 00:10:12.836]  He sued the so-called journalist that put it out.
[00:10:13.836 --> 00:10:19.017]  And it's come out in court now that there was a previous British study that got no attention that showed his very findings.
[00:10:20.097 --> 00:10:25.999]  They found the antibodies in the intestines of children for the measles with autism.
[00:10:27.334 --> 00:10:30.876]  Japan has said you can't have Gardasil anymore, a month ago.
[00:10:32.257 --> 00:10:35.179]  You've got all of this going on.
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:37.901]  You've got examples.
[00:10:40.062 --> 00:10:42.984]  In India, they banned, a couple years ago, the Gardasil shot.
[00:10:43.004 --> 00:10:45.045]  They said, okay, we'll take the lobbyist's money.
[00:10:45.485 --> 00:10:47.186]  Okay, we'll say girls should take this.
[00:10:47.627 --> 00:10:49.188]  Oh my goodness, it's killing a bunch of people.
[00:10:49.228 --> 00:10:51.289]  It's making people have autoimmune disorders.
[00:10:51.369 --> 00:10:52.570]  It's making people get lupus.
[00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:55.652]  It's making people have blood come out of every pore in their body.
[00:10:56.553 --> 00:11:00.654]  You've seen all the cheerleaders on the news who died with their mothers talking about it.
[00:11:00.674 --> 00:11:02.035]  I mean, just type in Gardasil deaths.
[00:11:03.735 --> 00:11:05.396]  They had a bunch of deaths during the trials.
[00:11:05.476 --> 00:11:09.617]  And then Rick Perry came out and lied and said that it was the law.
[00:11:12.478 --> 00:11:15.979]  You've got to take the shot in Texas, like he was Emperor, King of Earth.
[00:11:16.199 --> 00:11:22.001]  And people went out by the hundreds of thousands and gave their girls shots.
[00:11:23.874 --> 00:11:27.062]  And then a bunch of them died, a bunch of them got paralyzed, a bunch of them had health problems.
[00:11:27.663 --> 00:11:30.890]  And so the story here is, what is a foreign government?
[00:11:31.572 --> 00:11:33.697]  I forgot to get a water, I need one real bad, thanks.
[00:11:37.833 --> 00:11:58.190]  It's so obvious what's going on here and it's just a gang of government bullies and others and media bullies trying to persecute as heretics and and blacklist in a type of Soviet corporatist
[00:11:59.864 --> 00:12:08.690]  Authoritarian intimidation, anybody that speaks out about anything outside of the establishment norm.
[00:12:11.231 --> 00:12:20.477]  And the establishment norm itself is just wall-to-wall anti-sovereignty, anti-family, anti-private property,
[00:12:23.686 --> 00:12:32.313]  Medical liberty, anti-privacy, I mean just pure authoritarianism, thank you, called liberalism.
[00:12:34.755 --> 00:12:50.427]  And you've got to establish an authoritarianism from the right wing as well, because the same special interest will buy off any group or politician they can, and then have them try to package it for conservatives, package it for liberals, package it for libertarians, the co-opt movements, I mean you know how this works.
[00:12:51.067 --> 00:13:01.276]  If you can control the government, if you've got a big government, you can control the market, you can control the corporate welfare, you can control the implementation of regulations, this is the real discrimination in our world.
[00:13:01.676 --> 00:13:10.064]  And they want us so obsessed on race, and religion, and sex, and all this other diversions, as political footballs, while they steal the whole world.
[00:13:11.246 --> 00:13:14.489]  Again, I monitor MSNBC in the coffee room, CNN, Fox.
[00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:17.953]  We have different areas of the office because television's on, monitoring it.
[00:13:18.313 --> 00:13:19.675]  C-SPAN, another office.
[00:13:20.756 --> 00:13:21.897]  We flip through the channels.
[00:13:21.977 --> 00:13:23.118]  I monitor it on XM.
[00:13:23.599 --> 00:13:25.701]  And all they do is one message.
[00:13:26.342 --> 00:13:28.324]  Branding, branding, branding.
[00:13:28.864 --> 00:13:32.328]  Any type of owning guns, property, family is racist.
[00:13:33.934 --> 00:13:42.542]  Anybody that wants to have any free market is evil and backwards and hates everyone.
[00:13:43.222 --> 00:13:44.704]  Branding, branding, branding.
[00:13:44.764 --> 00:13:45.865]  Go after the Tea Party.
[00:13:46.205 --> 00:13:52.550]  Go after real grassroots libertarians that, by the way, are getting major seats in the House.
[00:13:53.462 --> 00:13:55.204]  And that's what Joe Biden's freaking about.
[00:13:55.884 --> 00:13:57.726]  Freaking out about when he talks to millionaire donors.
[00:13:58.767 --> 00:14:00.669]  And the audio gets leaked a few months ago.
[00:14:00.729 --> 00:14:02.550]  That's what Obama talks about to big donors.
[00:14:02.911 --> 00:14:05.513]  And that's what Karl Rove talks about to the Republican leadership.
[00:14:06.114 --> 00:14:07.955]  Because they're all part of the same establishment.
[00:14:08.235 --> 00:14:14.441]  And if they can't suppress the Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Libertarian type, they're gonna lose.
[00:14:16.002 --> 00:14:19.305]  And so every time I walk by MSNBC, I mean every time,
[00:14:20.168 --> 00:14:23.069]  This just happened 20 minutes ago, right before the show started.
[00:14:23.629 --> 00:14:34.771]  I was hearing, well, it's just the racist Ted Cruz, and you know they hate Hispanics, and they're very racist, and the racist Rand Paul, with no proof, no nothing.
[00:14:34.791 --> 00:14:39.852]  And for someone who's informed, you watch it, you go, this is cartoonish.
[00:14:40.512 --> 00:14:46.133]  But for people that are just purely politically correct, they go, well, I better not be pro-gun, that's racist.
[00:14:47.239 --> 00:14:49.700]  I better not be pro-sovereignty.
[00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:50.421]  That's racist.
[00:14:50.441 --> 00:15:01.847]  I better be for the expansion of NAFTA and GATT and all these other trade deals into Asia, the Caribbean, Europe, thousands of pages long, sometimes tens of thousands.
[00:15:02.567 --> 00:15:06.570]  I saw some number the other day where the new trade agreements, 50-something thousand pages long.
[00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:14.118]  It's just every special interest writing in what they want, and sometimes they get a whole area of law written for $10,000.
[00:15:14.318 --> 00:15:26.232]  I was reading where lobbyists come in and will give $100,000 in one day to a candidate, and it's like $10,000 here, $10,000 there, and they're getting billions sometimes for $10,000 donation.
[00:15:30.273 --> 00:15:39.514]  You can give $100,000 and meet with the president privately for 15 minutes, and if they can do it, then he tells his aide, okay, get that done, and they do it!
[00:15:40.692 --> 00:15:47.176]  Oh, you gave the President, you know, with your dealership group in Indiana, Minnesota, and a couple of the states up there.
[00:15:47.196 --> 00:15:48.437]  Remember this came out in the news?
[00:15:48.798 --> 00:15:50.499]  Oh, you gave $2 million to the Democrats?
[00:15:51.199 --> 00:15:56.002]  Oh, you want the dealerships taken from other people and given to you that they have contractually?
[00:15:56.143 --> 00:15:57.023]  Well, the government runs it now.
[00:15:57.043 --> 00:16:02.547]  We'll just take 100-plus dealerships worth millions apiece and give it to you because you gave a couple mil.
[00:16:03.147 --> 00:16:06.870]  I mean, folks, this is just pure gangsterism.
[00:16:08.527 --> 00:16:12.249]  These people are pure gangsters, and they're making their move.
[00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:14.971]  The dam broke on the Democratic watch, okay?
[00:16:15.311 --> 00:16:19.514]  You know, folks, I say vote Constitutionalist.
[00:16:19.814 --> 00:16:23.957]  Just so happens you get more Republicans that tend to be Constitutionalists, and less of them get co-opted.
[00:16:24.137 --> 00:16:31.622]  The Republican leadership is pure New World Order eugenics evil in this country since the days of the Rockefeller Republicans in the 70s.
[00:16:32.803 --> 00:16:33.624]  There's no doubt.
[00:16:34.502 --> 00:16:35.382]  That they're bad news.
[00:16:35.462 --> 00:16:41.204]  But there is a real rebellion within the Republicans by the Libertarians that has a shot.
[00:16:42.284 --> 00:16:42.844]  A shot.
[00:16:43.705 --> 00:16:44.405]  A good shot.
[00:16:44.425 --> 00:16:46.025]  50-50, I'd say.
[00:16:46.825 --> 00:16:50.847]  And you gotta get behind Libertarian constitutional Republicans.
[00:16:51.727 --> 00:16:53.247]  And some of them will end up betraying us.
[00:16:53.867 --> 00:16:56.808]  But, you know, you know John McCain's the enemy.
[00:16:57.548 --> 00:17:02.250]  John McCain is now out in the news saying there's no doubt the concealed carry is being used.
[00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:03.030]  It's racist.
[00:17:05.015 --> 00:17:08.478]  And we need to have a federal law restricting concealed carry.
[00:17:10.479 --> 00:17:10.679]  See?
[00:17:10.839 --> 00:17:11.740]  There they go, folks.
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:13.001]  They do not want you armed.
[00:17:13.681 --> 00:17:17.264]  They want you to live like folks in Chicago, New York, or D.C., disarmed.
[00:17:18.185 --> 00:17:19.285]  Because they're mafia, folks.
[00:17:19.305 --> 00:17:20.566]  They are mafia.
[00:17:21.067 --> 00:17:29.333]  I have been in meetings over the years, by circumstance or by dumb luck, with
[00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:47.178]  High-level Hollywood people, high-level corporate people, and all they do is sit around talking about killing people, and ruining their competition, and chomping on cigars, and slapping, you know, supermodels on the hind end saying, get me a drink.
[00:17:47.539 --> 00:17:49.160]  I mean, folks, that's who runs this country.
[00:17:49.801 --> 00:17:51.182]  The senators and people are nothing.
[00:17:51.382 --> 00:17:54.725]  They fawn after the corporate and Hollywood chiefs.
[00:17:55.526 --> 00:18:02.071]  Vice presidents and presidents on jets, I've been told, by multiple top-level A-list stars just fawn after them.
[00:18:03.072 --> 00:18:06.415]  They are disconnected completely from reality.
[00:18:09.577 --> 00:18:17.444]  In their own la-la land, Let Them Eat Cake, Marie Antoinette, where 2,000-plus companies got waivers from Obamacare,
[00:18:18.655 --> 00:18:22.643]  In direct competition with their competition, bankrupting their competition.
[00:18:22.663 --> 00:18:28.954]  I mean, do you know what it means if, say, you're Whataburger, and you don't get a waiver on Obamacare, but McDonald's does?
[00:18:31.698 --> 00:18:32.559]  What do you think that does?
[00:18:33.319 --> 00:18:34.320]  Let's say you're Walmart.
[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:39.265]  You get a waiver, but the local dollar store chain doesn't.
[00:18:39.345 --> 00:18:39.905]  What does that do?
[00:18:39.945 --> 00:18:41.006]  I mean, folks, this is 101.
[00:18:42.208 --> 00:18:51.936]  Instead of building an economy and having a real economy not based on corruption, we're going, we're Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Chile, Brazil.
[00:18:53.317 --> 00:18:54.038]  Argentina.
[00:18:54.058 --> 00:19:04.011]  Argentina, 50 years ago, anthropologists, sociologists would tell you, was probably more wealthy than the US on average, one of the wealthiest countries in the world, because they didn't allow corruption.
[00:19:04.451 --> 00:19:05.693]  They fell to it, folks.
[00:19:05.933 --> 00:19:06.895]  They're now incredibly poor.
[00:19:07.615 --> 00:19:08.437]  In 50-something years.
[00:19:09.594 --> 00:19:10.834]  Okay, it's the same deal here.
[00:19:11.194 --> 00:19:18.096]  You let crooks in, they'll run scams all day and shut everything down but them, and then why not even shut that down?
[00:19:18.376 --> 00:19:19.856]  They will ruin everything.
[00:19:20.056 --> 00:19:25.617]  They will turn our country into cardboard slums and fly over us in jet copters to their armored redoubts.
[00:19:26.617 --> 00:19:31.458]  And our daughters will sell themselves to them for pennies on the dollar, because it's the only future they have.
[00:19:31.719 --> 00:19:33.419]  They want you poor as a weapon.
[00:19:34.315 --> 00:19:38.757]  We will end up like Africa, like Latin America, like Eastern Europe if we allow this to happen.
[00:19:38.977 --> 00:19:41.939]  We must reinvent the Renaissance, the Enlightenment.
[00:19:42.179 --> 00:19:44.600]  We must restore the Republic now.
[00:19:45.921 --> 00:19:48.722]  They are shutting everything down right now that they don't own.
[00:19:50.523 --> 00:19:57.046]  As a political domination, but also as a way to transfer all wealth to themselves.
[00:19:57.066 --> 00:19:58.246]  We'll come back with all the big news.
[00:19:58.526 --> 00:19:59.327]  Mancow's coming up.
[00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:02.561]  What does freedom mean to you?
[00:20:02.621 --> 00:20:05.502]  How about the freedom to take control of your own future?
[00:20:05.782 --> 00:20:09.264]  At eFoods Direct, we're again celebrating Food Freedom Month.
[00:20:09.584 --> 00:20:18.709]  In July, for every $329 you spend on our highly nutritious, great-tasting food, you will receive a $190 Patriot Pack free.
[00:20:18.989 --> 00:20:23.571]  For example, purchase a six-month supply and get three Patriot Packs free.
[00:20:23.791 --> 00:20:31.015]  The Patriot Pack is a 24-day supply of eFoods Quick Fix, easy-to-store food, plus stove, fuel, and cookware.
[00:20:31.015 --> 00:20:31.635]  I think so.
[00:21:02.355 --> 00:21:05.216]  Ceramic Body Armor is rated to stop six hits.
[00:21:05.496 --> 00:21:06.657]  But what about the seventh?
[00:21:06.877 --> 00:21:10.918]  Unlike ceramic or Kevlar, Infidel Body Armor is proven to take hit after hit.
[00:21:11.138 --> 00:21:12.459]  And it just won't quit.
[00:21:12.699 --> 00:21:19.182]  Reasonably priced and designed for the smart civilian prepper, Infidel stops hundreds of hits from small arms to high-powered rifles.
[00:21:19.402 --> 00:21:21.362]  That means safety and peace of mind.
[00:21:21.543 --> 00:21:24.324]  Buy yours at InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[00:21:24.624 --> 00:21:28.025]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:21:30.666 --> 00:21:31.687]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:31.787 --> 00:21:36.092]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:21:36.253 --> 00:21:41.899]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold before your retirement.
[00:21:41.999 --> 00:21:45.303]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:21:45.563 --> 00:21:48.384]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:50.344 --> 00:21:53.045]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.

[00:22:05.708 --> 00:22:06.888]  What are bitcoins?
[00:22:07.348 --> 00:22:13.350]  A bitcoin is the first decentralized currency that can be easily transferred from person to person over the internet.
[00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:15.250]  No bank needed.
[00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:20.912]  This means lower fees and accounts can never be frozen, limited or closed.
[00:22:21.332 --> 00:22:23.132]  You are in control of your money.
[00:22:23.592 --> 00:22:24.392]  And the best part?
[00:22:24.752 --> 00:22:27.993]  You can start earning and making money with Bitcoins right away.
[00:22:28.373 --> 00:22:35.775]  No computer or expertise is required to earn money with Bitcoins and a growing number of merchants now accept Bitcoins.
[00:22:36.215 --> 00:22:39.958]  Plus, they're easily exchanged for dollars, euros, and more.

[00:23:57.030 --> 00:23:58.773]  MyPatriotsSupply.com
[00:24:05.486 --> 00:24:07.727]  Alright folks, Alex Jones back live.
[00:24:08.367 --> 00:24:22.134]  You know, I would think regardless of what your political bent is on a planetary scale, no matter where you are in the world, you would want to support a mother who has an autistic child's right to investigate vaccines as one of the main causal effects.
[00:24:22.734 --> 00:24:32.779]  When so many parents, thousands on record, I've talked to hundreds myself, go in as the third round of shots at 18 months, take the shots, the kid has a convulsion, never talks again.
[00:24:33.578 --> 00:24:35.779]  And then they have an autoimmune response, blood on the brain.
[00:24:35.799 --> 00:24:39.481]  And then the inserts say it can do that to you.
[00:24:40.402 --> 00:24:45.184]  And then there's all these countless studies, and they go, oh, kooks say mercury hurts your brain.
[00:24:45.484 --> 00:24:47.045]  Kooks say fluoride hurts your brain.
[00:24:47.325 --> 00:24:52.428]  You're like, well, I have a Harvard study right here saying it causes massive IQ reduction.
[00:24:53.149 --> 00:24:54.869]  And they go, oh, sure you do, dummy.
[00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:56.110]  Look, he can talk.
[00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:57.371]  He thinks he's smart.
[00:24:59.858 --> 00:25:10.451]  This is the type of arrogance that we're talking about, and I'm going to play a clip of this coming up with Man Cow, where they're on Fox, CNN, you name it, saying, she doesn't need a show, she shouldn't be on the air.
[00:25:11.352 --> 00:25:17.760]  Bipartisan hordes of people whose shows are probably a third or more financed by big pharma ads.
[00:25:18.985 --> 00:25:20.866]  Where they say, having to urinate too much?
[00:25:20.887 --> 00:25:21.667]  Well, take this drug!
[00:25:21.687 --> 00:25:29.834]  And then it lists, like, 30 seconds of may kill you, brain damage, liver failure, death, uh, make you commit suicide.
[00:25:29.854 --> 00:25:38.160]  Every time I watch TV, it's like, half the drug ads are like, it may make you commit suicide, or cause mass murder, blood clots, death, psychopathic activities.
[00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:39.021]  And it's like...
[00:25:40.233 --> 00:25:42.134]  But the person's smiling, and they're always smiling.
[00:25:42.174 --> 00:25:45.555]  The woman's got an umbrella, where it's going, may cause you to commit suicide.
[00:25:45.575 --> 00:25:48.796]  And she's like, walking out the front doors of the building, smiling.
[00:25:48.856 --> 00:25:50.176]  I saw that on TV this weekend.
[00:25:50.196 --> 00:25:51.136]  I forget which ad it was.
[00:25:51.376 --> 00:25:58.179]  You've all seen it, like, may cause heart attack, may cause autoimmune disease, may cause liver failure, may cause suicidal thoughts or suicidal actions.
[00:25:58.439 --> 00:26:00.239]  And look, the person's walking, waving.
[00:26:00.259 --> 00:26:01.940]  You know, at first, they're sad.
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:05.401]  Oh, the wonderful drug will help you be all happy.
[00:26:06.445 --> 00:26:07.685]  And then it goes, but it may kill you.
[00:26:07.825 --> 00:26:10.506]  I mean, the inserts say this on the vaccines.
[00:26:11.807 --> 00:26:19.189]  But then it's like, this crazy Jenny McCarthy, she says it may have caused her son to be autistic.
[00:26:19.229 --> 00:26:21.270]  It happened after he got his second round of shots.
[00:26:21.570 --> 00:26:22.130]  She's nuts!
[00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:22.870]  She's dangerous!
[00:26:23.071 --> 00:26:23.911]  Don't give her a show!
[00:26:24.813 --> 00:26:32.541]  This is the reason I haven't taken a show on Discovery Channel, History Channel, A&E, Court TV, then it became True TV.
[00:26:32.581 --> 00:26:36.104]  I mean, I'll be on people's shows occasionally with today's work.
[00:26:36.725 --> 00:26:42.350]  But, you know, Man Cow over and over again has said, hey, come be part of this, you know, this TV show I'm developing.
[00:26:42.931 --> 00:26:44.212]  And I've told him, no, no, no.
[00:26:45.553 --> 00:26:48.355]  I could probably be on the Discovery Channel show with him right now.
[00:26:48.375 --> 00:26:50.076]  Because Mankiewicz is a great guy.
[00:26:50.096 --> 00:26:51.477]  He's had a lot of different hit TV shows.
[00:26:52.838 --> 00:27:01.683]  And I just don't mess with it because if I'm in the show and sign a contract, I've got to then let them do whatever they want with the reality TV show.
[00:27:03.264 --> 00:27:05.906]  And I almost wish I would have been involved in God.
[00:27:09.096 --> 00:27:12.061]  Guns and automobiles, because it's turned out to be a pretty good show.
[00:27:13.063 --> 00:27:18.712]  Mildly libertarian, mildly pro-family, mildly pro-strong male figure.
[00:27:19.113 --> 00:27:19.593]  Mildly.
[00:27:22.267 --> 00:27:24.309]  The White House run Media Matters wants it shut down.
[00:27:24.589 --> 00:27:29.194]  I mean, that's a big deal, folks, that the Canadian government says, don't give Jenny McCarthy a show.
[00:27:29.635 --> 00:27:31.116]  Oh, get Mancow Show off.
[00:27:32.538 --> 00:27:36.902]  Media Matters and MSNBC tell congressmen, don't go on Alex Jones' show.
[00:27:37.222 --> 00:27:38.584]  We're going to dictate to you.
[00:27:38.844 --> 00:27:40.226]  DrudgeReport.com.
[00:27:40.526 --> 00:27:41.547]  You don't link to him.
[00:27:41.727 --> 00:27:43.369]  It's all about how they're the bosses.
[00:27:43.609 --> 00:27:46.190]  When they have tiny audiences, but it still works!
[00:27:46.730 --> 00:27:57.855]  When they bully Fox News about Napolitano coming on, Napolitano was told, well, Media Matters doesn't like you doing this, and the White House is putting pressure on us, so you can't go on his show or any other Libertarian shows.
[00:27:58.616 --> 00:27:59.356]  And there, I've said it.
[00:28:00.216 --> 00:28:01.457]  Two years ago, I was told that.
[00:28:01.717 --> 00:28:04.338]  You notice he hasn't been on, because of Media Matters!
[00:28:04.358 --> 00:28:06.779]  And you're like, well, how does Media Matters do that?
[00:28:06.939 --> 00:28:10.201]  Because the Justice Department will go arrest Rupert Murdoch.
[00:28:10.481 --> 00:28:12.262]  And I was told that by Fox executives.
[00:28:13.211 --> 00:28:13.471]  Okay?
[00:28:13.832 --> 00:28:19.438]  Fox executives repeatedly tried to get me up there for their Fox syndication development.
[00:28:19.938 --> 00:28:20.719]  And I said, no.
[00:28:20.759 --> 00:28:25.404]  They said, well, just do satellite feeds for us with focus groups.
[00:28:25.644 --> 00:28:27.206]  And they said, oh my God, this show will be a hit.
[00:28:27.246 --> 00:28:28.787]  We want this show, Fox News.
[00:28:29.148 --> 00:28:29.828]  I said, okay.
[00:28:30.949 --> 00:28:33.370]  Go ahead and pass it up and see if it gets authorized.
[00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:34.711]  And of course it got killed.
[00:28:35.031 --> 00:28:42.895]  And that's why they had articles in New York Magazine going, Alex Jones wants to be on Fox, but he'll never be.
[00:28:43.235 --> 00:28:53.699]  And that was a Fox executive saying that because they knew full well Fox came and begged me probably seven, eight times to do shows, pilot shows.
[00:28:53.899 --> 00:28:57.161]  And I said, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:28:57.501 --> 00:28:59.122]  No, no, no, because I'm not stupid.
[00:28:59.342 --> 00:29:00.842]  It's going to get killed higher up.
[00:29:01.223 --> 00:29:05.404]  I met with executives 10 years ago and said gun shows will be top rated if you do it.
[00:29:06.024 --> 00:29:08.926]  Court TV, True TV, A&E.
[00:29:09.586 --> 00:29:18.229]  I don't fly out to LA now and they go, first class will fly out for this meeting with the president of this network or the vice president of that network or the head of programming.
[00:29:18.629 --> 00:29:22.071]  And I go, look, you're just going to pick my brain for more shows.
[00:29:23.172 --> 00:29:25.354]  And even if the show gets picked up, it's gonna get killed.
[00:29:25.815 --> 00:29:26.415]  So, no.
[00:29:27.036 --> 00:29:30.499]  I mean, I had development from Discovery Channel calling me two days ago.
[00:29:30.559 --> 00:29:31.480]  I haven't even called them back.
[00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:33.042]  And I'm not bragging here.
[00:29:33.642 --> 00:29:37.186]  It's because I know they won't let me get on air, or they'll twist it.
[00:29:38.246 --> 00:29:43.088]  And so, they want Jenny McCarthy off, they want Mankow off, they wanted to show the Bible off!
[00:29:43.488 --> 00:29:47.630]  These are a bunch of gatekeeping, authoritarian, gangster scumbags!
[00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:48.310]  Well, guess what?
[00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:50.131]  I got my own show, scum!
[00:29:50.311 --> 00:29:51.211]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.711 --> 00:29:53.312]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.232 --> 00:29:57.094]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:33:18.157 --> 00:33:24.279]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:33:24.659 --> 00:33:26.219]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:32.701 --> 00:33:38.102]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, few things get me hotter under the collar.
[00:33:39.222 --> 00:33:46.004]  Few things get me more angry than scum trying to censor me.
[00:33:46.963 --> 00:33:52.567]  And they've got media matters and White House campaigns on record that make phone calls to sponsor stations.
[00:33:52.947 --> 00:33:55.329]  They openly try to get talk show hosts off the air.
[00:33:55.749 --> 00:34:04.375]  That's why even though I compete directly with Rush Limbaugh, I have gone, and Clear Channel knows this, and bought advertising not once but twice during boycotts of Rush Limbaugh.
[00:34:05.275 --> 00:34:06.676]  A, I'm supporting the First Amendment.
[00:34:07.237 --> 00:34:11.079]  B, I get about third price advertising when that's happening.
[00:34:11.419 --> 00:34:12.540]  So it's also free market.
[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:13.921]  So it's a win-win.
[00:34:14.021 --> 00:34:15.782]  I'm all about win-wins, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:15.802 --> 00:34:16.743]  I'm all about synergy.
[00:34:17.924 --> 00:34:23.370]  Uh, and when they try to take him down, and all of talk radio with it, I then rush in to defend.
[00:34:23.691 --> 00:34:25.593]  It's a basic instinct of winners.
[00:34:26.193 --> 00:34:26.854]  You understand that?
[00:34:27.635 --> 00:34:32.260]  And another man who for 20 plus years on talk radio syndicated all over the nation
[00:34:33.121 --> 00:34:34.442]  Famous feuds with Howard Stern.
[00:34:34.482 --> 00:34:35.062]  You name it.
[00:34:35.162 --> 00:34:36.202]  Fox TV host.
[00:34:36.503 --> 00:34:37.903]  His own TV shows on Fox.
[00:34:38.203 --> 00:34:39.964]  Part of Fox and Friends for over a decade.
[00:34:40.584 --> 00:34:41.705]  Multiple hit TV shows.
[00:34:41.745 --> 00:34:45.246]  He's now got one of the top three shows on History Channel.
[00:34:45.727 --> 00:34:46.807]  And just exploding.
[00:34:46.827 --> 00:34:49.328]  And it's a good show I can watch with my family.
[00:34:49.768 --> 00:34:51.089]  And so I tune in every Monday.
[00:34:51.109 --> 00:34:52.169]  And this is not product placement.
[00:34:52.189 --> 00:34:54.250]  I'm not being paid by History Channel.
[00:34:54.290 --> 00:34:54.951]  Though I should be.
[00:34:55.711 --> 00:34:56.952]  To talk about God.
[00:34:58.032 --> 00:34:59.294]  Guns and automobiles.
[00:34:59.354 --> 00:35:11.570]  Now, the name had Media Matters, we'll put that on screen in a moment, or I'll pull it up, had Media Matters come out before they'd even seen it months ago and say, this show shouldn't be on, it's another horrible gun show.
[00:35:11.970 --> 00:35:16.035]  There it is, meet Mankal Muller, the conspiracy theorist star of History Channel's new gun show.
[00:35:17.014 --> 00:35:18.455]  And that was one of the latest ones.
[00:35:18.595 --> 00:35:23.939]  They had another one demonizing the fact that he appears on this show and that he's an acolyte and trying to drive a wedge.
[00:35:23.979 --> 00:35:24.579]  It's what they do.
[00:35:24.919 --> 00:35:26.620]  That's the authoritarian left's deal.
[00:35:26.901 --> 00:35:28.542]  They tell you who you can have on air.
[00:35:28.882 --> 00:35:36.267]  They tell you that if you don't support turning your guns in, you are a racist.
[00:35:36.827 --> 00:35:49.317]  Again, Media Matters has almost no visitors, but they are the direct talking points for MSNBC on record, and they're run by the former White House transition chief and about, what, 15 other White House people, and they have weekly meetings with the White House.
[00:35:49.737 --> 00:35:51.699]  This is their go-between.
[00:35:51.919 --> 00:35:58.885]  They use the IRS to shut down Tea Party, to shut down Pro-Life, to shut down businesses they don't like, NSA spying on the press.
[00:35:59.145 --> 00:36:02.407]  These are flaming authoritarian scumbags!
[00:36:03.268 --> 00:36:09.594]  And what came out three years ago in Politico, they said, we will even get hired at companies and we will infiltrate them and bring them down.
[00:36:10.495 --> 00:36:14.179]  So we have to run background checks on people to make sure they don't even work with these.
[00:36:14.279 --> 00:36:16.261]  I mean, and I think we may have been hit by some before.
[00:36:16.641 --> 00:36:17.522]  We're dealing with that right now.
[00:36:18.083 --> 00:36:21.766]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, this is an intelligence operation we're facing.
[00:36:22.767 --> 00:36:27.212]  And they want to bring Drudge down and they want to bring anybody who isn't a complete communist, basically.
[00:36:28.294 --> 00:36:37.497]  Or isn't a corporate fascist that supports only the insiders like Google and Apple and Al Gore on the board, and the Foxcom, uh, Death Nets, and all the rest of it.
[00:36:37.797 --> 00:36:41.218]  If you're not part of their monopoly and their crew, you ain't part of the club.
[00:36:41.678 --> 00:36:41.978]  Okay?
[00:36:43.379 --> 00:36:50.981]  And so, now they are really going after his show, just like they tried to shut down the Bible, but see, something's happening in Hollywood and TV.
[00:36:52.219 --> 00:36:55.321]  The ratings are only for pro-gun, pro-God, liberty stuff.
[00:36:55.461 --> 00:36:59.503]  Instead of getting a half million views, you get 4 million views, 10 million views, 14 million views.
[00:37:00.183 --> 00:37:02.544]  And so the show has been picked up for a second season.
[00:37:02.585 --> 00:37:03.625]  It's already exploding.
[00:37:04.285 --> 00:37:06.126]  And just congratulations to Man Calcas.
[00:37:06.146 --> 00:37:08.248]  I know he's been in a lot of TV shows and development.
[00:37:08.288 --> 00:37:09.668]  He's offered me to be part of that.
[00:37:09.688 --> 00:37:10.609]  I've been too busy.
[00:37:11.049 --> 00:37:11.109]  Yes.
[00:37:31.431 --> 00:37:33.491]  I'm going to tell you a story that I've never told anyone.
[00:37:33.812 --> 00:37:36.092]  And you're not going to believe where I'm going with this.
[00:38:00.089 --> 00:38:05.790]  I was sitting with actor William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy, Captain Kirk, and Mr. Spock.
[00:38:06.491 --> 00:38:07.831]  Listen, Alex, you won't believe this story.
[00:38:08.491 --> 00:38:15.653]  They are fighting over Leonard Nimoy double-dipping in the avocado in the guacamole.
[00:38:16.533 --> 00:38:18.674]  This is at Shatner's house outside of Studio City.
[00:38:19.894 --> 00:38:22.174]  And we're watching the Super Bowl, as we do every year at Shatner's house.
[00:38:23.095 --> 00:38:25.355]  And they're fighting over Mr. Spock double-dipping.
[00:38:25.395 --> 00:38:25.975]  I just saw it.
[00:38:26.015 --> 00:38:26.455]  Wait, wait, wait!
[00:38:26.475 --> 00:38:26.916]  Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[00:38:27.916 --> 00:38:28.656]  Hey, what just happened?
[00:38:29.619 --> 00:38:30.720]  Something happened on the Super Bowl.
[00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:31.360]  We didn't know what.
[00:38:33.221 --> 00:38:34.822]  Janet Jackson's top had been pulled off.
[00:38:34.882 --> 00:38:36.002]  Nobody saw it at this party.
[00:38:36.042 --> 00:38:41.065]  Ben Stiller was there, and Greg Abigain from DJ and the Bear, and Adam West, TV's Batman.
[00:38:41.205 --> 00:38:43.166]  Anyway, we didn't really pay much attention to it.
[00:38:44.147 --> 00:38:53.412]  When I came into work the next day, the government was against me, and Adam Carolla, and Howard Stern, and Opie and Anthony.
[00:38:54.703 --> 00:39:02.150]  And any other show, your show, any other show that had a fairly educated audience, left or right, that moved voters.
[00:39:03.291 --> 00:39:04.292]  The government went after us.
[00:39:04.392 --> 00:39:07.735]  Now, not the urban shows, because they weren't worried about those shows.
[00:39:07.775 --> 00:39:10.978]  They're not moving people to vote.
[00:39:11.318 --> 00:39:16.363]  They weren't worried about... They staged stuff like that on purpose to then go after Libertarian speech.
[00:39:16.923 --> 00:39:20.807]  So, it was bizarre to me, because Janet Jackson's top got ripped off.
[00:39:22.125 --> 00:39:23.186]  So I contacted Stearns.
[00:39:23.206 --> 00:39:25.408]  This is what I'm going to tell you that nobody's ever heard.
[00:39:25.428 --> 00:39:29.451]  I contacted Corolla's representative and Opie and Anthony's representative.
[00:39:29.471 --> 00:39:31.092]  And I remember them being on the phone and others.
[00:39:31.833 --> 00:39:34.535]  And I said, guys, we've got to fight for free speech.
[00:39:35.696 --> 00:39:36.877]  We've got to all get together.
[00:39:36.897 --> 00:39:38.078]  This is bigger than my show.
[00:39:38.118 --> 00:39:39.359]  And I'm willing to fall on the sword.
[00:39:39.379 --> 00:39:40.660]  This is bigger than all of our shows.
[00:39:41.841 --> 00:39:43.002]  Why are we being attacked?
[00:39:43.282 --> 00:39:44.923]  We need to fight for free speech right now.
[00:39:50.636 --> 00:40:00.502]  Uh, Opie and Anthony said something that was just... They asked me about the size of my manhood or something and they... Everybody giggled on the phone and I went... Oh dear God, these morons.
[00:40:01.543 --> 00:40:05.486]  They don't realize what's coming for them and of course they've been... They've been pushed off the satellite.
[00:40:05.686 --> 00:40:06.746]  They've been marginalized.
[00:40:07.727 --> 00:40:13.251]  And, uh, you know, big corporations have picked up all of these shows, as you know, you see in our business.
[00:40:13.791 --> 00:40:14.531]  For nothing!
[00:40:14.611 --> 00:40:15.672]  And it's politically motivated.
[00:40:15.732 --> 00:40:16.873]  Imagine Rush Limbaugh.
[00:40:18.109 --> 00:40:19.629]  The biggest talk show host on the planet.
[00:40:20.129 --> 00:40:20.429]  Ever.
[00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:22.750]  Now controlled by people that absolutely hate him.
[00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:24.670]  Kennedy.
[00:40:24.690 --> 00:40:29.151]  Controlled by people that absolutely are on a mission to destroy these shows.
[00:40:29.251 --> 00:40:32.032]  Imagine working for... And now you're getting into inside baseball.
[00:40:32.052 --> 00:40:34.412]  And this is what I've been told by top executives across the board.
[00:40:34.632 --> 00:40:37.653]  There is a move to gut talk radio by design right now.
[00:40:37.853 --> 00:40:41.193]  Oh no, that's absolutely... Look, it's... Alex, let me tell you something.
[00:40:41.253 --> 00:40:41.673]  It's over.
[00:40:42.434 --> 00:40:43.194]  It's not.
[00:40:43.454 --> 00:40:44.274]  It's already over.
[00:40:45.610 --> 00:40:53.075]  And, uh, I mean, you know, you and I keep fighting and we keep, but, uh, look, it's, it, uh, Alec Baldwin, uh, yelling out homophobic remarks.
[00:40:53.395 --> 00:40:55.637]  Ray Dong Chong calling Oprah the N-word.
[00:40:55.997 --> 00:40:57.398]  This is fine because they're on the left.
[00:40:57.438 --> 00:41:00.300]  Oh, no, he's allowed to say, go to somebody's house and kill their children.
[00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:06.544]  That is a call to murderous action, and if he says that about my family, I'm coming after you, Baldwin!
[00:41:06.784 --> 00:41:09.086]  Yeah, yesterday, uh, the government took a vote.
[00:41:10.027 --> 00:41:13.793]  And they decided it was okay for the government to listen in on all of our phone calls.
[00:41:14.313 --> 00:41:15.235]  Oh yeah!
[00:41:15.455 --> 00:41:18.840]  And someone today said to me, well man, how did that happen?
[00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:25.489]  I said, when I was a child I went backstage and I saw Hulk Hogan and the Iron Sheik hanging out and it blew my mind.
[00:41:26.246 --> 00:41:33.511]  The Republicans and the Democrats, and I've hung out with all of them, presidents and all these politicians, and they do the fake fight on TV.
[00:41:33.571 --> 00:41:36.833]  You really do get into all the A-list parties, Mancow, so you get to see it all.
[00:41:36.853 --> 00:41:42.176]  What I'm trying to tell you is, well, do you think the government's going to vote to curtail their own behavior?
[00:41:42.257 --> 00:41:42.877]  Of course not.
[00:41:43.037 --> 00:41:43.717]  It's a pageant.
[00:41:44.238 --> 00:41:44.858]  It's fake.
[00:41:45.679 --> 00:41:48.841]  And people need to get out of this matrix and realize
[00:41:49.713 --> 00:41:51.053]  That, you know, they voted.
[00:41:51.474 --> 00:41:55.975]  Oh, and you trust Obama to end Bush and all of the rest?
[00:41:56.515 --> 00:41:58.436]  To police themselves?
[00:42:00.237 --> 00:42:01.197]  Well, that's a great lie.
[00:42:01.737 --> 00:42:03.238]  And I'm done with it.
[00:42:03.518 --> 00:42:05.018]  So, look, we have this little show.
[00:42:05.598 --> 00:42:06.619]  It had the word guns in it.
[00:42:07.379 --> 00:42:08.779]  It had the word guts in it.
[00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:10.320]  It had automobiles in it.
[00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:14.161]  And, you know, God and guns and guts and automobiles.
[00:42:14.721 --> 00:42:16.222]  And so everybody went out.
[00:42:17.125 --> 00:42:21.066]  The CNBCs, the MSNBCs, the ABCs, CBS, NBCs, name them.
[00:42:21.346 --> 00:42:22.007]  The BSes.
[00:42:22.947 --> 00:42:24.447]  The Government Propaganda Machines.
[00:42:25.147 --> 00:42:29.549]  Well, this show is promoting, um, it's going to shove God down your throat.
[00:42:30.209 --> 00:42:31.429]  It's going to be about guns.
[00:42:31.830 --> 00:42:35.050]  It's going to be about big cars when the environment is being destroyed.
[00:42:36.491 --> 00:42:38.652]  Uh, everything the show isn't about.
[00:42:39.152 --> 00:42:39.912]  But it didn't matter.
[00:42:40.092 --> 00:42:41.813]  Lie after lie after lie.
[00:42:42.613 --> 00:42:43.173]  And guess what?
[00:42:43.934 --> 00:42:47.537]  The ratings have been stellar, and America's responded to it, like you justifiably said.
[00:42:48.177 --> 00:42:49.678]  Like the Bible, they wanted that show.
[00:42:50.118 --> 00:42:55.202]  Look, I was in Hollywood after it, and everybody's walking around going, well, why did people watch that?
[00:42:56.282 --> 00:42:56.883]  Man, Cal, what?
[00:42:57.223 --> 00:42:58.364]  I mean, they were baffled by it.
[00:42:58.564 --> 00:43:02.647]  The fact is, these stories are the human stories.
[00:43:02.687 --> 00:43:03.527]  These are our stories.
[00:43:03.547 --> 00:43:04.388]  They resonate with us.
[00:43:04.908 --> 00:43:07.790]  The story of Noah and Moses, and these guys don't get it.
[00:43:08.451 --> 00:43:11.853]  They'd rather give us another Superman retread with 30 minutes of CGI.
[00:43:14.427 --> 00:43:19.652]  These are incredible stories, and look, my family prays together.
[00:43:20.353 --> 00:43:24.696]  A family that prays together laughs.
[00:43:24.836 --> 00:43:26.778]  You become undefeatable when you put on the armor.
[00:43:27.939 --> 00:43:31.142]  We believe that we should be able to protect our family, with a gun if necessary.
[00:43:32.183 --> 00:43:35.045]  We believe in big old American cars and American trucks.
[00:43:35.986 --> 00:43:37.888]  And I gotta tell you, we're a little bit racist.
[00:43:38.709 --> 00:43:40.010]  We believe in black cattle.
[00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:44.392]  And I'll tell you, we also, we shouldn't pick a color.
[00:43:44.432 --> 00:43:45.853]  We believe in green tractors.
[00:43:47.294 --> 00:43:49.095]  And this is very offensive to some people.
[00:43:50.256 --> 00:43:52.037]  We don't believe in buying our tractors from China.
[00:43:53.598 --> 00:43:58.001]  So anyway, it's just, it's, look, I'm just, I want to tell people, new levels, new devils.
[00:43:58.982 --> 00:44:02.264]  And if nobody is upset at you, well then you're not making a difference in the world.
[00:44:03.224 --> 00:44:06.506]  If nobody cares about you or your opinion, that's because you're safe.
[00:44:07.147 --> 00:44:07.927]  You're going along.
[00:44:08.408 --> 00:44:10.349]  You're marching off the cliff with the rest of the Lemmings.
[00:44:12.248 --> 00:44:18.272]  They really got mad because the ad for the show shows you and your brother putting on wedding rings and loving your wives.
[00:44:19.092 --> 00:44:26.357]  You're supposed to be running around, cheating on them, having some baby mamas, smoking dope.
[00:44:26.597 --> 00:44:28.139]  Kanye West and Kim Kardashian.
[00:44:29.259 --> 00:44:30.200]  He just beat up somebody.
[00:44:31.381 --> 00:44:32.642]  And they said it was jet lag.
[00:44:32.662 --> 00:44:33.222]  He was tired.
[00:44:33.702 --> 00:44:35.143]  Imagine if you beat up somebody, Alex.
[00:44:35.644 --> 00:44:38.486]  Imagine if you beat up one of these pedophiles or creeps at the airport.
[00:44:38.526 --> 00:44:39.907]  One of these TSA thugs.
[00:44:42.191 --> 00:44:44.592]  You know, you talk about how these guys are all getting cancer.
[00:44:44.632 --> 00:44:45.192]  Well, you know what?
[00:44:45.352 --> 00:44:46.232]  They should be in jail.
[00:44:46.352 --> 00:44:47.872]  They've all violated the Fourth Amendment.
[00:44:48.692 --> 00:44:51.773]  But anyway, I don't know if you have this story yet today.
[00:44:51.813 --> 00:44:56.394]  They just spent $767,000 on a gold toilet.
[00:44:57.954 --> 00:44:58.975]  These people are rewarded.
[00:45:00.155 --> 00:45:04.036]  And of course, if you're out there saying, God, our taxes are too high.
[00:45:04.516 --> 00:45:05.576]  Businesses are being hurt.
[00:45:07.094 --> 00:45:09.074]  Our economy is being destroyed by design.
[00:45:09.254 --> 00:45:09.895]  You're a racist.
[00:45:10.355 --> 00:45:12.995]  Well, no, what happens is then, you know, you get the IRS on you.
[00:45:13.355 --> 00:45:15.335]  I've been audited year after year illegally.
[00:45:16.736 --> 00:45:19.036]  And it's now all on record that they're persecuting us.
[00:45:19.056 --> 00:45:21.637]  I want to play a short clip about Jenny McCarthy.
[00:45:21.657 --> 00:45:27.698]  I mean, there's no doubt on so many studies, the inserts of the vaccines say they can kill you or cause an autoimmune disease.
[00:45:28.158 --> 00:45:32.058]  But then they go, oh, this crazy woman thinks vaccines should be looked into.
[00:45:32.338 --> 00:45:34.159]  And now they want her kicked off the view.
[00:45:35.299 --> 00:45:38.180]  Well, even if you don't agree with that, everyone should go.
[00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:39.961]  My God, this is authoritarianism.
[00:45:40.601 --> 00:45:46.683]  What the left said about McCarthy, they've gone light years past that, telling pro-life groups what they can pray.
[00:45:46.923 --> 00:45:48.804]  Let's go to this clip and get Mancow's take on it.
[00:45:49.304 --> 00:45:53.645]  If you're a media consumer or a media analyst like yourself, controversial figures are nothing new.
[00:45:54.105 --> 00:45:54.906]  I mean, we know that.
[00:45:55.746 --> 00:46:02.328]  But there's something different about Jenny McCarthy that's come up in the last 48 hours that really has received a lot of attention.
[00:46:02.348 --> 00:46:02.868]  Why?
[00:46:02.948 --> 00:46:04.729]  Why are people so concerned about this move?
[00:46:05.509 --> 00:46:06.830]  Well, Jenny McCarthy is funny.
[00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:17.895]  She's a former Playboy Playmate of the Year, but she's been getting pummeled in the media, Jenna, because she is a leading crusader for this utterly discredited theory that childhood vaccinations cause autism.
[00:46:17.955 --> 00:46:19.836]  Now, I'm sure she is sincere in that.
[00:46:19.856 --> 00:46:29.061]  She has a son who developed autism, but medical study after medical study has said this is junk science, including a recent one of nearly a thousand children in the Journal of Pediatrics.
[00:46:29.721 --> 00:46:30.041]  I don't know.
[00:46:44.978 --> 00:46:50.563]  I mean, there are studies everywhere that vaccines are causing autoimmune problems and doing all sorts of stuff.
[00:46:50.583 --> 00:46:54.265]  We've gone from 1 in 25,000 with autism to 1 in 50-something.
[00:46:54.686 --> 00:46:55.446]  It's an epidemic.
[00:46:55.466 --> 00:46:56.667]  But what about this idea?
[00:46:56.927 --> 00:47:03.052]  Because in her own private life, she's made statements about vaccines being dangerous that she can't have a show.
[00:47:03.112 --> 00:47:04.533]  This is wild.
[00:47:04.874 --> 00:47:05.174]  Alex.
[00:47:06.075 --> 00:47:06.235]  Alex.
[00:47:07.284 --> 00:47:08.626]  I'm going to take a left turn on you, okay?
[00:47:09.006 --> 00:47:09.226]  Yes.
[00:47:09.767 --> 00:47:11.809]  And you talk about how you want free speech.
[00:47:11.829 --> 00:47:12.731]  Can I have free speech?
[00:47:12.791 --> 00:47:13.011]  Yes.
[00:47:13.812 --> 00:47:14.913]  You're not going to like what I'm going to say.
[00:47:17.416 --> 00:47:20.039]  The fact is, folks, I know the truth about Alex Jones.
[00:47:21.281 --> 00:47:22.542]  And that is that he's a softy.
[00:47:23.604 --> 00:47:25.406]  And a lot of what you hear on the show is bluster.
[00:47:26.536 --> 00:47:30.417]  Kicking around town, kicking around Austin, Texas with him was one of the great joys of my life.
[00:47:30.437 --> 00:47:31.357]  He is a kook.
[00:47:32.057 --> 00:47:32.637]  In a good way.
[00:47:34.058 --> 00:47:35.298]  You would want him at your party.
[00:47:35.738 --> 00:47:36.818]  He's not a very serious guy.
[00:47:36.838 --> 00:47:38.059]  He's a very fun guy.
[00:47:38.859 --> 00:47:40.839]  And around his children, he's silly.
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:43.620]  He acts like he's about five years old.
[00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:45.360]  As I do with my kids.
[00:47:46.741 --> 00:47:52.462]  And I want to tell you, and it's going to be hard for me to fight back the emotion, because of
[00:47:54.074 --> 00:48:00.258]  My blessings and the role that I've had and the ability to facilitate so much communication.
[00:48:01.359 --> 00:48:02.259]  What am I even talking about?
[00:48:02.279 --> 00:48:03.240]  Let me get to it.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:16.568]  I've come out of my studio and seen people with 13-year-old girls in baby strollers, 15-year-old kids on gurneys, and they said, man, Cal, I had a healthy, beautiful child.
[00:48:17.789 --> 00:48:22.632]  They got the vaccine and their eyes rolled back in their head and they've never talked since.
[00:48:25.191 --> 00:48:27.952]  Their faces went blank, and that was it.
[00:48:30.153 --> 00:48:31.614]  Are all these people lying, Alex?
[00:48:32.674 --> 00:48:33.594]  They're trying to get the truth out.
[00:48:33.634 --> 00:48:35.675]  Look, and the fact is, I don't know the science.
[00:48:36.476 --> 00:48:42.238]  And I tend to think of Jenny McCarthy as a, you know, a playmate that was very annoying when she dated Jim Carrey.
[00:48:42.978 --> 00:48:45.399]  She's been in my studio, she's a, you know, she's a bubblehead.
[00:48:46.180 --> 00:48:49.021]  But I think her stance against the pharmaceutical companies is very brave.
[00:48:49.761 --> 00:48:51.902]  We used to get one shot at a time, now they bundle them.
[00:48:52.739 --> 00:48:58.262]  And I think for some young bodies, some young systems, immune systems, and again, I don't know.
[00:48:58.282 --> 00:48:58.982]  This I don't know.
[00:48:59.062 --> 00:49:01.323]  My uncle almost died from a tetanus shot.
[00:49:01.363 --> 00:49:02.944]  The doctors admitted it was the tetanus shot.
[00:49:03.164 --> 00:49:04.345]  He swole up for two weeks.
[00:49:04.765 --> 00:49:05.425]  Almost died.
[00:49:05.626 --> 00:49:08.567]  It's just too much for, you know, 20 shots at once in a single dose.
[00:49:09.347 --> 00:49:13.129]  And I just think it's too much for some of these young, uh, you know, systems.
[00:49:13.169 --> 00:49:16.011]  Japan just banned the Gardasil shot, man cow.
[00:49:18.021 --> 00:49:18.362]  Yeah.
[00:49:18.442 --> 00:49:20.723]  And look, who's crazy now?
[00:49:21.603 --> 00:49:23.724]  Elizabeth Hasselbeck is crazy.
[00:49:24.204 --> 00:49:28.246]  Jenny McCarthy, who questions all of these drugs we're putting into it.
[00:49:28.306 --> 00:49:29.107]  I don't know.
[00:49:29.407 --> 00:49:32.348]  This is some kind of bizarro Orwellian world we're living in.
[00:49:33.869 --> 00:49:35.850]  Well, they mentioned the Journal of Pediatrics.
[00:49:35.870 --> 00:49:40.673]  The Journal of Pediatrics, funded by the government, came out and said mercury is good for children's brains.
[00:49:40.693 --> 00:49:41.293]  Do we have that clip?
[00:49:44.096 --> 00:49:49.179]  We're going to cue it up and play it after the break, but I mean, how crazy has all this gotten?
[00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:54.463]  Alex, if you, if you, if you, if you took your, I mean, I'm just, I want to relate this back to you.
[00:49:54.563 --> 00:49:55.484]  I've seen you with your children.
[00:49:55.904 --> 00:50:00.987]  If you took your kid to the doctor, the kid got a shot and it never spoke again, wouldn't you be smart enough to go, there's a connection?
[00:50:01.808 --> 00:50:04.530]  And how insulting is it for all these people to say there's no connection?
[00:50:04.630 --> 00:50:05.991]  Something's happened to these children.
[00:50:07.125 --> 00:50:08.546]  Well, man, Cal, I read the insert.
[00:50:08.626 --> 00:50:10.687]  It says it can do it on the insert.
[00:50:10.747 --> 00:50:16.891]  That's what's so crazy, is that they admit all this, and then they go, crazy people think it can hurt you!
[00:50:17.171 --> 00:50:30.660]  And, brother, maybe, God, this is awful to say, maybe it's like anything else, you know, with the polio vaccine or any other vaccine, you know, there are kids that are going to react negatively to it.
[00:50:30.700 --> 00:50:34.082]  Maybe for the greater good it has to happen, but I do think it's happening.
[00:50:34.543 --> 00:50:36.044]  Well, I know you're playing devil's advocate, but
[00:50:36.974 --> 00:50:41.616]  Mancow, it's causing greater problems.
[00:50:41.776 --> 00:50:47.899]  I believe in immunization technology, if it's properly researched and applied.
[00:50:47.919 --> 00:50:51.161]  The problem is they're putting stuff in there on purpose, and I have the documents.
[00:50:51.621 --> 00:50:57.483]  I want to come back and talk about the NSA, everything we've talked about now coming true, but are we getting awards for it?
[00:50:57.543 --> 00:50:57.784]  No!
[00:50:58.064 --> 00:51:00.305]  We're even worse and need to be taken off the air.

[00:54:09.818 --> 00:54:13.426]  I was sitting in traffic, listening to the radio.
[00:54:14.804 --> 00:54:16.705]  All right, Eric Mancow Muller is our guest.
[00:54:16.825 --> 00:54:17.545]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:54:17.585 --> 00:54:23.267]  You can find his website at mancow.com and on affiliates all over the United States.
[00:54:23.407 --> 00:54:26.848]  And he has one of the top new hit shows on the History Channel.
[00:54:26.888 --> 00:54:28.269]  Very wholesome, but also funny.
[00:54:28.669 --> 00:54:31.030]  Man, his brother could be like in western movies.
[00:54:31.350 --> 00:54:33.591]  He's got, I call it in TV, high Q scores.
[00:54:34.111 --> 00:54:35.392]  Very watchable.
[00:54:36.352 --> 00:54:39.793]  And sounds just like his little brother, Eric Mancow Muller, who's with us.
[00:54:40.033 --> 00:54:41.514]  You know, I don't want to just say on air,
[00:54:42.114 --> 00:54:44.840]  The Journal of Pediatrics says that mercury is good for your child's brain.
[00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:47.986]  Of course, they've got over a thousand mainline studies you can look up.
[00:54:48.026 --> 00:54:49.489]  I say a thousand, it's more like ten thousand.
[00:54:49.950 --> 00:54:51.593]  Mercury is one of the most studied things out there.
[00:54:52.034 --> 00:54:53.216]  You can just type in electrode...
[00:54:54.446 --> 00:55:19.026]  uh... microscope and and you can see what mercury does it compared to all their heavy metals it causes electro uh... convulsive explosions in the electrochemical brain cells it's the most destructive metal in the brain you can find all the different university uh... you know microscope uh... footage of that uh... and we've done this before but here is KI this aired nationwide uh... because they have news packages that air locally this was a nationally written piece
[00:55:19.406 --> 00:55:22.628]  But this aired in Austin, and they say this still.
[00:55:22.688 --> 00:55:26.511]  I think the Harvard says right here, mercury is good for your child's brain.
[00:55:27.191 --> 00:55:28.672]  Let's go ahead and go to that clip.
[00:55:50.147 --> 00:56:06.362]  By the way, boys IQs, you can pull this up, Harvard study by the way, over 20 point reduction, girls about 17, and this is going on, it's a fact, they're killing us, and next they're going to say cyanide is good for your child, and if Jenny McCarthy doesn't agree, she should be fired from The View, man-cow.
[00:56:07.142 --> 00:56:09.104]  Oh my God.
[00:56:11.767 --> 00:56:12.888]  It's a bizarre world, isn't it?
[00:56:15.219 --> 00:56:15.899]  What do you think about it?
[00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:22.343]  Literally, I used to go on your show 10-12 years ago and you even thought I was a kook, but you're more conspiracy than most people.
[00:56:22.603 --> 00:56:24.484]  I mean, come on Mancow, it's all come true so far.
[00:56:24.804 --> 00:56:25.225]  Wait a minute.
[00:56:25.725 --> 00:56:26.925]  Let me say something, okay?
[00:56:27.666 --> 00:56:43.855]  I... I want to tell you there's a... I had a moment where I opened up my window, I was on the 35th floor on Wacker Street in Chicago, and I opened up my window and there was a... And there was a...
[00:56:44.893 --> 00:56:47.215]  A helicopter on silent mode looking at me, unmarked.
[00:56:48.276 --> 00:56:50.258]  And I got on and talked about it, and I was insane.
[00:56:50.659 --> 00:56:51.700]  I absolutely, I saw it.
[00:56:51.860 --> 00:56:52.280]  It happened.
[00:56:52.340 --> 00:56:53.741]  And everybody, oh, he's insane!
[00:56:54.202 --> 00:56:55.823]  And now, of course, we take it for granted.
[00:56:56.444 --> 00:57:00.908]  You came on my show and talked about drones on American soil, and I thought you were crazy.
[00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:02.470]  Um...
[00:57:05.416 --> 00:57:08.578]  NSA, chemicals in the water, now it's all mainstream.
[00:57:08.838 --> 00:57:14.100]  Last, uh, excuse me, two nights ago they did the military exercises again where they did the crackdown of the city of Chicago where I'm at.
[00:57:14.460 --> 00:57:17.181]  Why is the military practicing attacking American cities?
[00:57:17.982 --> 00:57:20.343]  Because they know that the economy is teetering on the brink.
[00:57:21.549 --> 00:57:22.690]  I loved CBS last night.
[00:57:22.710 --> 00:57:26.932]  They can't figure out why nobody's buying into this economy being fantastic.
[00:57:27.312 --> 00:57:28.033]  Because it's not.
[00:57:28.413 --> 00:57:32.835]  All you have to do is drive down the street and see another storefront boarded up every day, you see another one.
[00:57:33.355 --> 00:57:37.878]  All you have to do is talk to anyone you know about how the economy is affecting their family.
[00:57:38.438 --> 00:57:42.780]  All you have to do is talk to any business owner about what Obamacare is going to do to communist healthcare.
[00:57:43.340 --> 00:57:47.943]  Then you question, well why would John Roberts and others turn their back on their foundation?
[00:57:48.523 --> 00:57:50.064]  Why would a Supreme Court justice
[00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:54.002]  Go against everything he stands for, for communist health care.
[00:57:54.322 --> 00:57:56.704]  It's clearly illegal, clearly unconstitutional.
[00:57:57.224 --> 00:58:05.669]  And then this guy sitting over in Russia who got a book deal yesterday, Snowden, the leaker, you know, tells us, oh, they listen to all those Supreme Court conversations.
[00:58:07.310 --> 00:58:10.733]  So I believe that these guys are being blackmailed and controlled by our government.
[00:58:11.573 --> 00:58:17.637]  I want to tell you, I want to tell you about, you know, this special class, the government and judges that nobody can say anything to.
[00:58:18.538 --> 00:58:19.138]  There was a preacher
[00:58:20.046 --> 00:58:20.466]  Stay there.
[00:58:20.506 --> 00:58:21.927]  We're back in 60 seconds, Mancow.
[00:58:21.947 --> 00:58:22.247]  Stay there.
[00:58:22.267 --> 00:58:22.847]  We're live.
[00:58:22.907 --> 00:58:24.988]  Do a little bit more with me here.
[00:58:25.008 --> 00:58:33.352]  We're going to open the phones up, folks, for the next hour and cover all the Supreme Court rulings, what's happening with the House rejects bid to curb spy agency collection.
[00:58:33.372 --> 00:58:36.493]  We're going to get into all of it coming up, but Mancow's our guest.
[00:58:36.993 --> 00:58:38.074]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:43.636 --> 00:58:47.598]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:51.107 --> 00:58:52.347]  What does freedom mean to you?
[00:58:52.367 --> 00:58:55.248]  How about the freedom to take control of your own future?
[00:58:55.508 --> 00:58:59.009]  At eFoods Direct, we're again celebrating Food Freedom Month.
[00:58:59.330 --> 00:59:08.452]  In July, for every $329 you spend on our highly nutritious, great-tasting food, you will receive a $190 Patriot Pack free.
[00:59:08.712 --> 00:59:13.294]  For example, purchase a six-month supply and get three Patriot Packs free.

[00:59:20.196 --> 00:59:21.377]  We're good to go.
[00:59:53.881 --> 00:59:55.783]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.264 --> 00:59:59.027]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.595 --> 01:00:09.780]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.441 --> 01:00:11.242]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.023 --> 01:00:12.904]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.565 --> 01:00:17.229]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.770 --> 01:00:21.834]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.042 --> 01:00:29.684]  Alright folks, we're into hour number two, and we've got Eric Mancow Muller, syndicated radio host, hit show.
[01:00:30.404 --> 01:00:32.024]  God, guns, and automobiles.
[01:00:32.544 --> 01:00:34.465]  The White House has openly wanted to shut down.
[01:00:34.485 --> 01:00:36.926]  It's like they want Jenny McCarthy kicked off The View.
[01:00:37.086 --> 01:00:37.626]  Incredible.
[01:00:38.406 --> 01:00:41.267]  Finishing up with him before we come back with news and take your phone calls.
[01:00:41.747 --> 01:00:45.048]  Now, you were telling a story about a preacher in Chicago.
[01:00:46.088 --> 01:00:50.950]  He basically said, look, if he's in court, he said, if the judge doesn't judge me, then God will judge her.
[01:00:51.010 --> 01:00:52.010]  God judges all of us.
[01:00:52.882 --> 01:00:55.264]  And of course that's a threat, and they want to put the pastor in jail.
[01:00:55.724 --> 01:00:58.527]  This is what's happened in Canada, where they make Christian preachers.
[01:00:59.568 --> 01:01:01.429]  Everything that a Christian says is hate speech.
[01:01:01.549 --> 01:01:02.510]  Oh yeah, I saw that!
[01:01:02.930 --> 01:01:07.534]  In fact, they want to put him in jail for saying, fine, God will jizzle.
[01:01:07.574 --> 01:01:08.215]  They hate that!
[01:01:08.455 --> 01:01:12.398]  Yeah, and quickly, the number two book in America is called Zealot.
[01:01:13.839 --> 01:01:20.605]  Everybody's interviewed this writer, who is an Islamo-fascist, anti-Christian Muslim.
[01:01:21.514 --> 01:01:22.835]  Nobody mentions that in their interviews.
[01:01:23.055 --> 01:01:25.676]  And people are reading this book thinking that Christianity was made up.
[01:01:26.436 --> 01:01:29.297]  And he's basically using the line that a lot of Islamofascists use.
[01:01:29.818 --> 01:01:32.599]  Two other quick things, Alex, two other quick things you asked me what I want to talk about.
[01:01:32.619 --> 01:01:32.999]  Here we go.
[01:01:33.019 --> 01:01:36.200]  93-year-old woman raped and beaten almost to death by an illegal?
[01:01:36.881 --> 01:01:38.441]  I thought it was only scientists.
[01:01:39.102 --> 01:01:43.423]  And the next person was going to cure cancer that was coming here illegally.
[01:01:43.964 --> 01:01:46.905]  What about all these great people that are breaking into our country we keep hearing about?
[01:01:47.561 --> 01:01:48.081]  One other thing.
[01:01:49.022 --> 01:01:53.025]  I was in Kansas City filming the TV show for the History Channel, and I've been all over America.
[01:01:53.445 --> 01:01:56.987]  I was in New York when the riots were supposed to break out.
[01:01:57.287 --> 01:02:01.470]  I think it's really a great time right now in America.
[01:02:01.790 --> 01:02:02.671]  We talk about the negatives.
[01:02:02.691 --> 01:02:03.591]  Let me say something great.
[01:02:04.392 --> 01:02:06.393]  Al Sharpton, my friend, he's a friend of mine.
[01:02:06.413 --> 01:02:07.774]  We don't agree on anything politically.
[01:02:08.354 --> 01:02:13.297]  But Jesse Jackson and others have tried to stir up the race hate.
[01:02:13.557 --> 01:02:14.438]  That's how they make their money.
[01:02:15.111 --> 01:02:16.612]  We talked on your show today.
[01:02:16.632 --> 01:02:17.692]  You think it's backfiring.
[01:02:18.232 --> 01:02:20.353]  Brother, I want to tell you, you and I have talked about this.
[01:02:20.473 --> 01:02:25.335]  I think it's wonderful that African Americans have woken up and said, you know what, we're not buying into it.
[01:02:25.516 --> 01:02:26.776]  We're not going to burn our neighborhoods.
[01:02:26.796 --> 01:02:27.416]  We've done that.
[01:02:27.917 --> 01:02:28.897]  It's stupid.
[01:02:30.418 --> 01:02:33.379]  Not a single white person thinks Zimmerman is white.
[01:02:36.781 --> 01:02:39.822]  Trayvon's record is that he had burglary tools in his
[01:02:40.789 --> 01:02:42.430]  In his locker and stolen items.
[01:02:42.550 --> 01:02:45.732]  And the suppressed photos on his phone was a gun and loot, reportedly.
[01:02:46.032 --> 01:02:47.273]  The guy, look, the guy was violent.
[01:02:47.313 --> 01:02:48.593]  This rap music is violent.
[01:02:49.033 --> 01:02:50.454]  This is what the culture is producing.
[01:02:51.295 --> 01:02:56.257]  Anyway, look, the kid was probably doing Robitussin, Watermelon Soda, and Skittles.
[01:02:56.758 --> 01:02:58.398]  It's a hot drug here now in Chicago.
[01:02:58.418 --> 01:02:58.799]  Skittles.
[01:02:58.819 --> 01:03:00.860]  I mean, look at the gangster photos he was putting out.
[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:05.002]  Sporting the full grill and the gangster, you know, Flavor Flay look.
[01:03:05.452 --> 01:03:09.654]  Look, I've interviewed some of the jurors, and let me tell you what I've come to believe, Alex, and I want to share this quickly with your audience.
[01:03:10.234 --> 01:03:11.895]  Zimmerman would have gotten two or three years.
[01:03:12.195 --> 01:03:13.976]  He probably should have spent a year or two in jail.
[01:03:14.016 --> 01:03:15.536]  Sorry, I know that offends some people.
[01:03:16.157 --> 01:03:17.017]  A kid was killed.
[01:03:17.057 --> 01:03:18.438]  I wish Trayvon had not been killed.
[01:03:19.078 --> 01:03:30.363]  But the judge was so repulsive, and I believe so pressured by Obama to put Zimmerman in jail for 25 years, that when the jury said, you know what, if we give it over to this judge, she's going to put him away for 25 years.
[01:03:30.983 --> 01:03:32.544]  She's going to put Zimmerman away forever.
[01:03:33.326 --> 01:03:34.167]  And we can't do that.
[01:03:34.247 --> 01:03:39.049]  Had this judge been reasonable and not so obviously biased... That's what Jimmy Carter said.
[01:03:39.090 --> 01:03:40.050]  Yeah, they overcharged him.
[01:03:40.190 --> 01:03:40.931]  They overcharged him.
[01:03:40.951 --> 01:03:43.992]  Wasn't that judge just a giant pile of Bravo Sierra?
[01:03:45.053 --> 01:03:45.373]  What's that?
[01:03:46.074 --> 01:03:48.895]  That judge looked like a giant steaming pile of Bravo Sierra.
[01:03:49.095 --> 01:03:52.718]  He looked like something that Jabba would poop out.
[01:03:54.799 --> 01:03:55.239]  That's good.
[01:03:55.279 --> 01:03:56.520]  I'm gonna steal that Jabba poop.
[01:03:58.822 --> 01:03:59.943]  So, all right.
[01:04:00.103 --> 01:04:05.067]  Well, brother, listen, I appreciate your props on the show, and you're a tough critic, so I appreciate it.
[01:04:05.107 --> 01:04:12.493]  And look, it is about family, and I think, you know, crazy people in Austin, just like in Chicago, we believe in family.
[01:04:12.613 --> 01:04:13.034]  Exactly.
[01:04:13.114 --> 01:04:15.736]  Listen, you've offered me and these TV pitches to be part of it.
[01:04:16.076 --> 01:04:18.338]  I'm always just too busy, and I don't believe they're going to give me a show.
[01:04:18.378 --> 01:04:22.081]  I've been offered a bunch of others in the contracts, but it's too controlling.
[01:04:22.101 --> 01:04:23.742]  But I love appearing in shows.
[01:04:23.862 --> 01:04:24.823]  What happened with Jesse?
[01:04:25.879 --> 01:04:27.759]  I don't know how you do a daily radio show and do these shows.
[01:04:48.925 --> 01:04:50.206]  Well, the episodes are getting better.
[01:04:50.226 --> 01:04:51.347]  The first one was pretty good.
[01:04:51.948 --> 01:04:52.809]  The third one I've seen.
[01:04:52.869 --> 01:04:53.850]  It's just, it's awesome.
[01:04:54.110 --> 01:04:55.411]  Mancow, we'll talk to you soon.
[01:04:55.431 --> 01:04:58.074]  Mancow, let me say bye to you during the break.

[01:07:13.832 --> 01:07:15.473]  It all comes down to one thing.
[01:07:15.774 --> 01:07:17.055]  We are what we eat.
[01:07:17.415 --> 01:07:21.717]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[01:07:22.057 --> 01:07:26.039]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[01:07:26.279 --> 01:07:28.600]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:34.783]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[01:08:13.786 --> 01:08:17.410]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.971 --> 01:08:22.056]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:36.866 --> 01:08:42.391]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, we are now into our number two, and I want to open the phones up here.
[01:08:42.411 --> 01:08:47.496]  On any issue we should discuss, we're going to do first-time calls again today.
[01:08:47.516 --> 01:08:50.078]  I like to alternate first-time calls.
[01:08:50.439 --> 01:08:54.262]  It's always nice to do wide open phones, but then folks wanting to plug things.
[01:08:55.203 --> 01:08:57.645]  Or bring up idiosyncratic issues.
[01:08:58.725 --> 01:08:59.746]  Basically dominate the show.
[01:08:59.766 --> 01:09:01.627]  So that's why I do first-time calls about half the time.
[01:09:01.947 --> 01:09:04.609]  We don't screen your calls, just first-time calls.
[01:09:04.629 --> 01:09:09.772]  800-259-9231 on all the news we just covered in the last hour.
[01:09:10.232 --> 01:09:16.596]  Or I love the wild card grab bag wheel of fortune for whatever you want to bring up here on the transmission.
[01:09:16.856 --> 01:09:18.437]  Any questions, any comments, you name it.
[01:09:18.457 --> 01:09:18.497]  800-259-9231.
[01:09:24.591 --> 01:09:25.132]  800-259-9231.
[01:09:25.152 --> 01:09:40.666]  If you just heard the last hour, we talked about Jenny McCarthy, CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, Big Pharma, the Canadian government, all coming out saying, don't let her have a show on The View.
[01:09:42.025 --> 01:09:44.045]  Not because she's a communist, because she's not a communist.
[01:09:44.085 --> 01:09:46.146]  It's like the old Red Scare, but worse.
[01:09:46.166 --> 01:09:48.366]  Because there really were communists, but it went too far.
[01:09:48.687 --> 01:09:50.987]  This is, you think vaccines might be dangerous.
[01:09:51.227 --> 01:09:53.568]  Everyone knows, there's no problems, no side effects.
[01:09:54.128 --> 01:09:57.569]  I show you articles every year when the vaccine season comes around the start of school.
[01:09:57.889 --> 01:10:00.089]  There's zero side effects, they're conspiracy.
[01:10:00.509 --> 01:10:03.130]  And then I read the actual CDC side effect.
[01:10:03.650 --> 01:10:05.471]  You know, hundreds of pages on air.
[01:10:06.671 --> 01:10:07.691]  Hundreds of pages of it.
[01:10:07.991 --> 01:10:11.392]  Death, brain damage, autoimmune, retardation.
[01:10:12.994 --> 01:10:15.795]  Narcolepsy, epilepsy, on, on.
[01:10:15.815 --> 01:10:18.876]  I mean, go to CDC vaccine adverse reaction page.
[01:10:18.896 --> 01:10:19.577]  Don't believe me.
[01:10:21.377 --> 01:10:22.858]  Jenny McCarthy's crazy.
[01:10:22.898 --> 01:10:24.799]  She says vaccines might hurt people.
[01:10:25.639 --> 01:10:27.460]  She says fish might be in the ocean.
[01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:28.720]  The sun might come up in the morning.
[01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:30.521]  Bears might live in the woods.
[01:10:31.001 --> 01:10:32.902]  Birdies might live in trees and nests.
[01:10:34.102 --> 01:10:36.703]  Women might like to paint their nails.
[01:10:37.843 --> 01:10:39.464]  And Papa likes to drink beer.
[01:10:39.804 --> 01:10:41.725]  You never heard something that crazy, did you?
[01:10:45.595 --> 01:10:47.455]  Absolutely off the chart.
[01:10:47.816 --> 01:10:53.117]  Cuckoo, Cocoa Puff, crazy.
[01:10:53.137 --> 01:10:53.857]  800-259-9231.
[01:10:53.877 --> 01:11:02.439]  Okay, where to start here with some of the news we've not yet plowed through today.
[01:11:02.959 --> 01:11:04.100]  I'm gonna get this cop on.
[01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:05.520]  Look at this article out of Reason.
[01:11:05.820 --> 01:11:09.341]  Cop fired for speaking out against ticket and arrest quotas.
[01:11:10.923 --> 01:11:22.131]  Quotas have been known for decades and the police have been told to lie and say that there is no quota system.
[01:11:22.171 --> 01:11:26.615]  Folks, the DWI police in Austin make over $100,000 a year while the other cops make $40,000, $50,000.
[01:11:31.906 --> 01:11:33.229]  And that's why they pull you over.
[01:11:33.510 --> 01:11:34.031]  Been drinking?
[01:11:34.071 --> 01:11:35.094]  Well, just get out here and walk.
[01:11:35.154 --> 01:11:35.936]  No probable cause.
[01:11:36.177 --> 01:11:37.480]  Get out here and walk around for me.
[01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:38.903]  If you had one beer, they'd take you to jail.
[01:11:39.244 --> 01:11:40.928]  It's because it's a big cash machine.
[01:11:42.674 --> 01:11:43.735]  Nothing to do with your safety.
[01:11:43.795 --> 01:11:46.157]  Texting while driving is five times more dangerous.
[01:11:46.337 --> 01:11:47.498]  You don't need drunk driving laws.
[01:11:47.698 --> 01:11:49.880]  If someone's recklessly driving, it's a felony.
[01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:51.781]  You're crossing the lines repeatedly?
[01:11:52.001 --> 01:11:53.282]  They got a dash cam video?
[01:11:53.502 --> 01:11:54.463]  Are they testified of that?
[01:11:54.683 --> 01:11:55.424]  Then you've been drinking?
[01:11:55.624 --> 01:11:56.405]  Probable cause?
[01:11:56.625 --> 01:11:58.166]  We're talking five years in jail.
[01:11:58.466 --> 01:12:00.628]  That'll cut out drunk driving.
[01:12:01.188 --> 01:12:05.752]  Not having two beers when you weigh 250 pounds and come driving home.
[01:12:07.772 --> 01:12:10.034]  Now they're doing cheek swabs all over the country.
[01:12:10.174 --> 01:12:15.057]  Arkansas, California, with no warrant, and doing instant marijuana tests.
[01:12:15.938 --> 01:12:18.280]  I've seen studies where marijuana drivers actually drive safer.
[01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:20.942]  Yeah, the slow lane, 10 miles under the speed limit.
[01:12:22.142 --> 01:12:23.463]  Marijuana heads.
[01:12:23.583 --> 01:12:26.005]  Yeah, let's arrest them in charge.
[01:12:26.045 --> 01:12:27.066]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[01:12:27.406 --> 01:12:31.749]  What about all the pill heads out there on all these psychotropics and pain pills?
[01:12:31.849 --> 01:12:34.171]  Oh, well, if it's a prescription, then that's okay.
[01:12:34.371 --> 01:12:35.592]  But wait, the system's hungry.
[01:12:35.612 --> 01:12:36.773]  They're going after them now, too.
[01:12:38.908 --> 01:12:39.989]  So I want to get this guy on.
[01:12:40.009 --> 01:12:41.510]  This is Auburn, Alabama.
[01:12:41.550 --> 01:12:45.812]  It's home to sprawling plains, Auburn University, and a troubling police force.
[01:12:46.853 --> 01:12:51.956]  After the arrival of the new police chief, the department entered an era of ticket quotas and worse.
[01:12:52.217 --> 01:12:54.218]  Yeah, you know why I like the Travis County Sheriff's Department?
[01:12:54.638 --> 01:12:56.119]  From what I've seen in it, they don't have a quota.
[01:12:56.980 --> 01:13:01.362]  I mean, you've got to really be driving recklessly for them to give you, you know, to mess with you.
[01:13:02.083 --> 01:13:03.384]  Austin just gets worse and worse.
[01:13:03.444 --> 01:13:06.446]  And man, the state police, I mean, that is a cash machine.
[01:13:07.540 --> 01:13:09.662]  And now, these state police aren't like they used to be.
[01:13:11.384 --> 01:13:15.788]  I mean, they pull you over, and they'll even know who I am, but I've learned to do this to everybody.
[01:13:15.808 --> 01:13:19.091]  They're not singling me out and... You do any drugs?
[01:13:19.131 --> 01:13:19.972]  You got any alcohol?
[01:13:20.012 --> 01:13:22.134]  You on any kind of... mind if I search the vehicle?
[01:13:22.967 --> 01:13:25.050]  And I just like, just flip out on them.
[01:13:25.110 --> 01:13:30.758]  I mean like, I flip out like, you know the government deals the drugs, stop bugging your eyes out at me like I've done something wrong!
[01:13:30.778 --> 01:13:35.203]  I mean it's just, it's a, the government, it's a narcotics trafficking murder gang!
[01:13:35.444 --> 01:13:37.026]  Stop acting like I did something!
[01:13:37.467 --> 01:13:39.169]  I'm sorry, I need to settle down right there at that point.
[01:13:42.466 --> 01:13:44.688]  The country is completely overrun by the New World Order.
[01:13:45.128 --> 01:13:47.451]  And let me explain something to the police.
[01:13:47.851 --> 01:13:50.754]  No amount of tickets are going to keep the cities and counties and states going.
[01:13:50.954 --> 01:13:52.976]  They're run by city managers in almost every case.
[01:13:52.996 --> 01:13:55.298]  I've had city managers of major cities on to admit this.
[01:13:55.318 --> 01:13:58.861]  75% of the money or more goes into offshore banks.
[01:13:58.941 --> 01:14:01.103]  It's called the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report.
[01:14:01.323 --> 01:14:03.725]  The budget is less than a third of the real money.
[01:14:04.542 --> 01:14:05.542]  Everything's about the budget.
[01:14:05.582 --> 01:14:07.323]  They never tell you about the other set of books.
[01:14:07.623 --> 01:14:08.383]  It's sleight of hands.
[01:14:09.363 --> 01:14:10.883]  The money's all gone, folks.
[01:14:11.124 --> 01:14:12.584]  It's all actuaried.
[01:14:12.944 --> 01:14:13.644]  Look up that term.
[01:14:13.664 --> 01:14:14.264]  Don't know what it is.
[01:14:14.504 --> 01:14:15.365]  To bankrupt us.
[01:14:15.645 --> 01:14:18.685]  We will all go the way of Detroit.
[01:14:20.166 --> 01:14:20.966]  If they have their way.
[01:14:21.066 --> 01:14:22.786]  I don't know how else to explain it to you.
[01:14:23.266 --> 01:14:25.247]  Except for Lower Manhattan.
[01:14:26.192 --> 01:14:32.998]  Austin, Texas, San Francisco, Whitefish, you know, Montana, and a few other places.
[01:14:33.219 --> 01:14:37.703]  Elite listed, Agenda 21, Technocratic Command Zones.
[01:14:38.023 --> 01:14:40.345]  You're like, that sounds like Hunger Games!
[01:14:40.685 --> 01:14:45.230]  Yeah, that's science fiction product placement, propaganda placement.
[01:14:45.250 --> 01:14:46.491]  They call it behavior placement.
[01:14:46.911 --> 01:14:51.776]  Years after I coined the term propaganda placement, the feds call it behavior placement.
[01:14:53.177 --> 01:14:55.238]  That's basically what they'd like to build.
[01:14:55.318 --> 01:14:58.358]  That's the plutocratic New World Order, Club of Rome vision.
[01:14:58.618 --> 01:15:00.339]  The technocrat vision is even worse.
[01:15:00.639 --> 01:15:01.739]  Just get rid of everybody.
[01:15:02.199 --> 01:15:05.880]  The minute China has robots in for everything, they hit the virus button.
[01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:07.360]  It's released.
[01:15:12.562 --> 01:15:17.303]  They're not building a technocratic system, though, to just have dominance.
[01:15:18.363 --> 01:15:21.124]  They're doing it to replace humans, then they're going to turn the robots off.
[01:15:22.006 --> 01:15:23.707]  And folks, this is not my opinion.
[01:15:24.247 --> 01:15:26.488]  I just cannot warn you strongly enough.
[01:15:26.528 --> 01:15:31.891]  You better go read what all the top futurists and globalists, from Ray Kurzweil to Bill Joy, write down the line.
[01:15:31.911 --> 01:15:34.952]  You better find out that what they're saying is actual policy.
[01:15:35.532 --> 01:15:36.993]  It isn't some pipe dream.
[01:15:37.433 --> 01:15:46.878]  And the technocrats have now merged with the plutocrats, and they have merged the program into a neo-feudalistic surf system, not to create a plutocratic
[01:15:47.438 --> 01:15:57.461]  Endless surf system, a Hunger Games scenario, to bring in the robots, to implode the economies, to get full control over humans, and an artificial scarcity system.
[01:15:57.681 --> 01:16:15.707]  See, the robots and automation mean, according to all the physicists and researchers and academics that I've interviewed, and I agree with their analysis, it's accurate, we should be working two days a week, coming up with ideas to empower humanity, having giant corporate and public buy-in kind of
[01:16:17.521 --> 01:16:18.645]  Massive scale!
[01:16:20.225 --> 01:16:21.846]  Crowdsourcing programs.
[01:16:22.326 --> 01:16:25.907]  There should be a global crowdsourcing program for space stations.
[01:16:26.367 --> 01:16:29.489]  There should be a global crowdsourcing program for moon bases.
[01:16:29.729 --> 01:16:32.090]  There should be a global... And they've all discussed this.
[01:16:32.110 --> 01:16:32.790]  They could do this.
[01:16:33.050 --> 01:16:34.210]  You'd work two days a week.
[01:16:34.411 --> 01:16:38.512]  We'd be wearing fricking aluminum outfits with jetpacks, folks.
[01:16:38.792 --> 01:16:39.453]  I'm telling you.
[01:16:39.593 --> 01:16:41.833]  And that's already what the globalists have, okay?
[01:16:42.454 --> 01:16:44.434]  They're just not giving you that.
[01:16:45.235 --> 01:16:46.835]  We're 2013, baby.
[01:16:47.076 --> 01:16:48.036]  We're in the future.
[01:16:49.465 --> 01:16:50.606]  Makes me so upset.
[01:16:52.288 --> 01:16:55.072]  Instead, the public wants their culture of bling.
[01:16:55.092 --> 01:16:58.957]  I don't care if you're a gangster type or one of these yuppies with their bling.
[01:16:59.658 --> 01:17:00.899]  You know, that's the perfect $50,000 bike.
[01:17:01.039 --> 01:17:06.846]  I'm talking about bicycle and the outfit and the country club and you're part of the elite.
[01:17:06.866 --> 01:17:07.908]  You're not part of anything.
[01:17:08.248 --> 01:17:11.290]  You're not part of the elite until you're an elite thinker for humanity.
[01:17:11.791 --> 01:17:13.752]  Nobody's elite joining the dark side.
[01:17:14.292 --> 01:17:17.615]  Lie into yourself thinking you're part of a winning operation.
[01:17:17.635 --> 01:17:22.478]  This is the most selfish, disgusting New World Order situation I've ever seen.
[01:17:22.538 --> 01:17:25.380]  See, one article just makes me go crazy, because that's how I think.
[01:17:26.881 --> 01:17:31.985]  I know the cops are told that, oh, if you don't write tickets, we're going to go bankrupt.
[01:17:33.006 --> 01:17:34.287]  Oh, you know there's a shortfall.
[01:17:34.307 --> 01:17:36.108]  They're like, all right, I'll go out and, you know,
[01:17:39.915 --> 01:17:42.157]  Cops don't go after bad guys anymore, folks.
[01:17:42.757 --> 01:17:49.242]  Because too much of the bad guy operations are run by higher-level government groups being funded by corporations to turn a blind eye.
[01:17:49.282 --> 01:17:49.962]  That's on record.
[01:17:50.543 --> 01:17:57.908]  And that's why Chicago crime bosses and New York crime bosses and all these guys hate the fact that citizens have got guns.
[01:17:58.128 --> 01:18:02.371]  Because how are they ever going to fully take over and plow things and socially engineer us if we've got guns?
[01:18:02.611 --> 01:18:08.536]  How are they going to have race wars and collapsing societies when all of the evil blue states
[01:18:10.188 --> 01:18:15.613]  And all of the evil red states, I'm being sarcastic, have to be played off against each other when it won't work if everybody's armed.
[01:18:17.635 --> 01:18:19.336]  The gangsters want our guns.
[01:18:19.356 --> 01:18:20.838]  800-259-9231.
[01:18:20.858 --> 01:18:27.344]  And if you don't write tickets, you get written up and then removed off the force.
[01:18:28.382 --> 01:18:32.484]  And now if you don't go and help the CPS take kids, you get thrown off the force.
[01:18:32.904 --> 01:18:39.666]  And now if you... on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on.
[01:18:39.766 --> 01:18:44.988]  And you get told, go out and violate people's rights, you know, we're doing it for their own good, blah blah blah.
[01:18:46.169 --> 01:18:49.290]  But you know that wealthy areas
[01:18:50.834 --> 01:18:56.678]  They pull over a black guy driving a $100,000 Mercedes in a suit, the cops aren't going to violate his rights.
[01:18:56.918 --> 01:19:05.223]  They pull over a $100,000 Mercedes with a white guy wearing an Armani suit, they're not going to violate his rights statistically, because they know this guy's got lawyers, this guy knows what he's doing.
[01:19:05.584 --> 01:19:11.868]  Of course they're going to violate poor blacks' rights and poor whites' rights and Hispanics' rights, because they're being told, do this,
[01:19:12.228 --> 01:19:17.132]  That's the fake, macho, thug culture the globalists are trying to social engineer into police.
[01:19:17.192 --> 01:19:23.637]  And they know these people can't stand up for themselves and have no history of liberty, no history of freedom, no community.
[01:19:23.957 --> 01:19:25.238]  The government's the community.
[01:19:25.458 --> 01:19:32.263]  The government got rid of Daddy in the House 50 years ago, and folks, there's not even a family, there's not even a culture.
[01:19:32.524 --> 01:19:33.925]  Daddy's MTV now.
[01:19:34.245 --> 01:19:37.567]  Flavor Flay is a young, black, 10-year-old's daddy.
[01:19:38.408 --> 01:19:40.289]  That's how you get in the million dollar house.
[01:19:40.309 --> 01:19:42.591]  The ten million dollar house is acting like an idiot.
[01:19:42.851 --> 01:19:45.753]  But in the real world, you don't go anywhere acting like Flavor Flay.
[01:19:46.453 --> 01:19:49.715]  Or acting like Kid Rock or all these other people.
[01:19:50.176 --> 01:19:53.898]  They create fake role models for you to destroy you.
[01:19:54.218 --> 01:19:54.999]  Destrotto.
[01:19:55.099 --> 01:19:56.280]  Is that how you say it in Italian?
[01:19:56.840 --> 01:20:00.983]  We'll be right back with your phone calls, the NSA, and all the rest.
[01:20:01.343 --> 01:20:02.564]  Don't throw away leftovers.
[01:20:02.905 --> 01:20:08.710]  Instead, throw all your leftovers, vegetable peels, eggshells, coffee grounds, pizza crusts, and more into the Bokashi!
[01:20:09.010 --> 01:20:16.937]  If you love to garden and compost, but don't like the hassle of turning a compost bin or the smell, then check out the E-M Bokashi Food Waste Recycling System from Terragonics.
[01:20:17.198 --> 01:20:22.663]  Finally, a way to recycle all your food and plant waste safely and effectively and stop using fertilizers.

[01:21:00.629 --> 01:21:02.029]  Bill Carroll here for Blue Tax.
[01:21:02.250 --> 01:21:05.370]  Just because the IRS says you owe them a lot of money, are you just going to do what?
[01:21:05.390 --> 01:21:07.311]  Throw your hands up in the air and write a check?
[01:21:07.411 --> 01:21:08.031]  What are you doing?
[01:21:08.051 --> 01:21:09.712]  You've got to fight this stuff.

[01:21:30.230 --> 01:21:30.991]  Call Blue Tax now at 1-800-501-7730.
[01:22:00.430 --> 01:22:09.674]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it lent back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[01:22:09.734 --> 01:22:10.454]  This capitalism?
[01:22:10.514 --> 01:22:16.637]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:22:16.677 --> 01:22:20.319]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[01:22:20.379 --> 01:22:21.279]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[01:22:21.299 --> 01:22:22.360]  It's time to understand the system.

[01:22:22.700 --> 01:22:23.040]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:22:30.191 --> 01:22:32.733]  There may be a hidden danger lurking in our homes.
[01:22:32.793 --> 01:22:35.215]  And without the right equipment, you'll never know it's there.
[01:22:35.395 --> 01:22:41.100]  Maser Instruments detect all forms of nuclear radiation, including alpha, beta, gamma, and x-rays.
[01:22:41.180 --> 01:22:42.281]  And are always on.
[01:22:42.381 --> 01:22:43.542]  Just like your smoke alarm.
[01:22:43.602 --> 01:22:46.364]  Detecting, measuring, and monitoring nuclear radiation.
[01:22:46.504 --> 01:22:47.345]  Made in America.
[01:22:47.505 --> 01:22:48.446]  Laboratory grade.
[01:22:48.526 --> 01:22:49.727]  And EMP resistant.
[01:22:49.807 --> 01:22:53.750]  If you can't reliably measure nuclear radiation, you're not fully prepared.
[01:22:53.830 --> 01:22:55.111]  But now you can be.
[01:22:55.191 --> 01:22:56.913]  At Maser Instruments dot com.
[01:22:56.953 --> 01:22:59.435]  Spelled M-A-Z-U-R Instruments dot com.
[01:23:00.523 --> 01:23:01.704]  What does freedom mean to you?
[01:23:01.764 --> 01:23:04.646]  How about the freedom to take control of your own future?
[01:23:04.926 --> 01:23:08.408]  At eFoods Direct, we're again celebrating Food Freedom Month.

[01:24:06.235 --> 01:24:14.919]  Alright, I'm gonna go to your phone calls and then I'm gonna break down the traitorous House of Representatives rejects bid to curb spy agency data collection.
[01:24:15.579 --> 01:24:29.566]  It's admittedly illegal, they're recording everything, have computers listening to everything, they're using it against Congress, they've tapped the phones and have microphones in the cloakroom, the Supreme Court, it's all come out
[01:24:30.475 --> 01:24:33.217]  And they're like, we're not gonna pass a law to restrict that.
[01:24:33.237 --> 01:24:34.238]  There's already laws.
[01:24:34.998 --> 01:24:40.982]  And let me tell you, this is the moment in corruption where the society either wakes up or totally collapses.
[01:24:42.023 --> 01:24:44.545]  Because now it's all out in the open.
[01:24:45.905 --> 01:24:46.206]  I mean, it's...
[01:24:47.358 --> 01:24:56.386]  It's been in the Chicago Tribune and Associated Press that major defense contractors run child kidnapping rings and connected to snuff film groups.
[01:24:56.446 --> 01:24:58.748]  And it's like, well, they're a big defense contractor.
[01:24:59.089 --> 01:25:01.271]  That's what, that's what killers do.
[01:25:01.811 --> 01:25:04.313]  It's a business, grabbing your kid out of the backyard.
[01:25:06.075 --> 01:25:09.616]  I mean, I'm looking at all this going, we gotta do something.
[01:25:09.636 --> 01:25:10.776]  They're putting poison in the water.
[01:25:10.816 --> 01:25:14.277]  They're trying to knock people off the air.
[01:25:14.297 --> 01:25:16.037]  I mean, these are crazy people!
[01:25:16.597 --> 01:25:19.938]  And the worst of the worst, because we let them run things, get into power.
[01:25:20.358 --> 01:25:25.379]  They shove the others out of the way, and you end up with the most demonic people in control.
[01:25:25.819 --> 01:25:28.600]  And now the House is, we have to spy on every American.
[01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:34.201]  Remember, it's not about Al Qaeda anymore, it's about the returning veterans and the gun owners.
[01:25:35.916 --> 01:25:37.217]  This is Twilight Zone, folks.
[01:25:37.298 --> 01:25:40.121]  And then I have a lot of other news we're going to be getting into as well.
[01:25:40.601 --> 01:25:45.947]  But before I go any further, if you're a TV viewer, anybody can watch the daytime radio show.
[01:25:45.967 --> 01:25:49.711]  It's free at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:25:49.731 --> 01:25:55.698]  Find the free podcast, the free iPhone, Droid apps, Flash players.
[01:25:57.284 --> 01:25:57.724]  You name it.
[01:25:57.764 --> 01:25:59.506]  I mean, it's got every player you can imagine on there.
[01:25:59.766 --> 01:26:02.409]  For the show, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:26:02.909 --> 01:26:04.151]  If you're a radio listener, you can go see this.
[01:26:04.231 --> 01:26:12.158]  Or just type in Bradley Manning Court and look at the photos of him when he's brought in and out of court through hallways.
[01:26:13.479 --> 01:26:18.844]  They will have Army soldiers in full combat gear with M4s
[01:26:23.027 --> 01:26:31.818]  And sidearms strapped to their legs with other people, private army security walking around, acting like the hundred-pound man is going to kill everybody.
[01:26:32.879 --> 01:26:34.621]  And see, this is the new style.
[01:26:35.241 --> 01:26:40.528]  They told Chinese princesses 3,000 plus years ago, bind your feet where you can't walk, it's sexy.
[01:26:41.872 --> 01:26:43.594]  And by the way, wear diapers.
[01:26:43.935 --> 01:26:44.556]  You can't get up.
[01:26:44.576 --> 01:26:45.597]  We're going to change your diaper.
[01:26:45.677 --> 01:26:46.198]  It's sexy.
[01:26:47.780 --> 01:26:49.062]  And you know what?
[01:26:49.122 --> 01:26:50.243]  Don't even learn how to talk.
[01:26:50.363 --> 01:26:50.964]  It's sexy.
[01:26:51.205 --> 01:26:53.548]  Really, it was the inter-priest class becoming the real emperors.
[01:26:55.086 --> 01:26:56.948]  And in every ancient culture, women got out of hand.
[01:26:56.988 --> 01:26:57.548]  They said, you know what?
[01:26:57.808 --> 01:27:00.410]  It's really sexy if you bind your feet up where you can't walk.
[01:27:00.811 --> 01:27:01.791]  Just sit there and shut up.
[01:27:02.472 --> 01:27:03.533]  They're like, oh, it's trendy.
[01:27:03.773 --> 01:27:06.155]  See, women are really controlled by style more than anybody.
[01:27:06.735 --> 01:27:09.197]  And the high priests in every culture figured this out.
[01:27:09.438 --> 01:27:14.422]  Whether it was ancient Europe, China, Japan, Mesoamerica, wealthy women got out of hand.
[01:27:14.782 --> 01:27:20.126]  So you just learned to go, it's very sexy to not leave this house and wear a hood over your head and be chained up against the wall.
[01:27:22.208 --> 01:27:24.370]  It's very sexy to have your feet bound up where you can't walk.
[01:27:25.384 --> 01:27:26.265]  Well, that's how it is now.
[01:27:26.806 --> 01:27:32.112]  The police have all got to have machine guns, and it's really sexy to have machine guns everywhere and checkpoints.
[01:27:32.273 --> 01:27:36.758]  And if you're having a party at the country club, have some cops with full combat gear out front.
[01:27:36.798 --> 01:27:38.681]  It's like, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
[01:27:38.721 --> 01:27:40.323]  It's like Jack Bauer's going to be there.
[01:27:40.823 --> 01:27:43.947]  See, they're using the same thing where, gee, I wish we had a checkpoint.
[01:27:44.690 --> 01:27:46.372]  Gee, I wish we had a drone over our house.
[01:27:46.672 --> 01:27:48.354]  Gee, I wish we had some forced inoculation.
[01:27:48.614 --> 01:27:50.557]  It's like real manly now to not have rights.
[01:27:51.217 --> 01:27:53.440]  And then you're not allowed to have a gun, but there's just troops everywhere.
[01:27:53.460 --> 01:27:55.703]  Remember in New York?
[01:27:55.803 --> 01:28:01.249]  You go to New York, you just see cops in battle helmets, literally making the most ridiculous faces you can imagine.
[01:28:01.289 --> 01:28:03.571]  You're like, how you doing, officer?
[01:28:05.894 --> 01:28:10.036]  That's the new manliness, not being informed, not knowing anything, not being involved.
[01:28:10.396 --> 01:28:22.983]  Just drink your fluoride, take your GMO, roll over and die, hand your kids over to the state, but just lift weights all day, and then just wear combat outfits and just stand there going... And everybody just worships you.
[01:28:23.263 --> 01:28:26.085]  Oh my god, oh the state's so powerful!
[01:28:28.396 --> 01:28:37.080]  And if you go to Mexico or Guatemala or Nicaragua or if you go to Romania or you go to North Korea, you're going to see the same thing.
[01:28:37.720 --> 01:28:41.422]  People stand around with machine guns looking at everyone for just nine hours a day.
[01:28:41.482 --> 01:28:45.784]  The troops are on power trips because they're getting the power trip of the dress-up.
[01:28:46.064 --> 01:28:47.324]  They dress up in the outfit.
[01:28:47.484 --> 01:28:48.745]  They're not fighting real armies.
[01:28:48.905 --> 01:28:50.045]  They're not fighting al-Qaeda.
[01:28:50.065 --> 01:28:51.266]  Their boss runs al-Qaeda.
[01:28:51.466 --> 01:28:52.947]  It's all simulated to take over.
[01:28:53.607 --> 01:28:54.647]  They're all under attack.
[01:28:54.687 --> 01:28:55.307]  They're losers.
[01:28:55.347 --> 01:28:56.428]  They work for the New World Order.
[01:28:56.608 --> 01:29:00.649]  They're being chemically warfare and biologically warfare targeted by the eugenicist program.
[01:29:00.789 --> 01:29:01.609]  They're going to die young.
[01:29:01.629 --> 01:29:02.649]  Their kids are going to die young.
[01:29:02.809 --> 01:29:04.110]  Their whole birthright's been taken.
[01:29:04.290 --> 01:29:04.810]  But you know what?
[01:29:04.850 --> 01:29:13.272]  They got uniforms and guns strapped to their leg and they're standing around going, yeah, command team delta, banker banker, yeah, yeah.
[01:29:13.512 --> 01:29:16.292]  We're going to run checkpoints and stop the drug running.
[01:29:16.873 --> 01:29:18.333]  The globalists fly the drugs in.
[01:29:19.468 --> 01:29:23.211]  Then any competition that doesn't pay their cut properly, you get told to go raid.
[01:29:23.452 --> 01:29:24.553]  You're just schmucks.
[01:29:24.853 --> 01:29:25.634]  You're jokes.
[01:29:25.934 --> 01:29:27.575]  The whole thing's a game.
[01:29:28.156 --> 01:29:31.319]  The whole thing is just a complete police state fraud.
[01:29:31.879 --> 01:29:35.302]  The old days, if cops were going in against thugs, they didn't even need bulletproof vests.
[01:29:35.543 --> 01:29:36.784]  They just ran in and kicked down the door.
[01:29:37.044 --> 01:29:40.627]  Nowadays, if there was a UT sniper, he'd be up there for nine days.
[01:29:40.888 --> 01:29:41.848]  The police would be down.
[01:29:42.609 --> 01:29:44.632]  Urinating on themselves in puddles on the ground.
[01:29:44.913 --> 01:29:48.378]  If citizens tried to fire up at them, the police would machine gun the citizens.
[01:29:48.799 --> 01:29:50.201]  I mean, citizens are dogs!
[01:29:50.221 --> 01:29:51.022]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.523 --> 01:29:53.126]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.067 --> 01:29:56.731]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.805 --> 01:30:02.446]  Introducing Pro-1.

[01:30:06.348 --> 01:30:10.751]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.

[01:30:49.420 --> 01:30:51.442]  And sodium hexafluorosilicate.

[01:31:00.836 --> 01:31:02.177]  Isn't Wi-Fi great?
[01:31:02.738 --> 01:31:04.759]  You can browse the web anywhere.
[01:31:05.340 --> 01:31:07.622]  Coffee shops, airports, libraries.
[01:31:08.202 --> 01:31:12.145]  But, using public Wi-Fi means that people can spy on you.
[01:31:12.446 --> 01:31:17.310]  And it's easy as... Yep, they can access your data at the touch of a button.
[01:31:17.910 --> 01:31:22.994]  Seriously, even your internet service provider can see every website you ever go to.
[01:31:23.795 --> 01:31:26.476]  Private Internet access has got your back.
[01:31:26.996 --> 01:31:27.256]  How?
[01:31:27.896 --> 01:31:35.398]  Well, it's kinda nerdy, but to put it simply, spies and companies that track you don't like us one bit.
[01:31:36.098 --> 01:31:39.779]  We create an encrypted tunnel so that nobody can spy on you.
[01:31:40.179 --> 01:31:45.220]  We also provide IP cloaking, which frees you from geographic restrictions when you're traveling.
[01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:50.001]  Register today and disappear online the way it was supposed to be.

[01:32:50.594 --> 01:32:55.455]  See them on the web www.5starsoap.com or call 1-800-340-7091 for a catalog.
[01:33:12.003 --> 01:33:19.809]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:23.632 --> 01:33:36.902]  By the way, the Wall Street Journal has recently come out, two days ago, and admitted we're turning into a total police state, and that militarized police wage war against an enemy, which makes us the enemy.
[01:33:37.262 --> 01:33:39.083]  Well, yeah, no, they now call us insurgents.
[01:33:39.972 --> 01:33:42.334]  It's now all insurgent control training.
[01:33:42.835 --> 01:33:44.156]  It's all, we live in Fallujah.
[01:33:44.777 --> 01:33:46.598]  We're all the enemy, for our safety of course.
[01:33:47.399 --> 01:33:51.443]  And it is a fetish thing to again be a slave and be under the control of it.
[01:33:51.683 --> 01:33:53.925]  Your kids are trained to put their hands up, march out of the school.
[01:33:54.245 --> 01:33:56.568]  And again, I get the fact the average cop isn't a bad person.
[01:33:57.108 --> 01:33:59.389]  The average cop in North Korea might not be a bad person.
[01:33:59.669 --> 01:34:01.209]  It's just that we're going that direction.
[01:34:01.509 --> 01:34:05.450]  We know police in other countries, in most cases, it's out of control and they're thugs.
[01:34:05.810 --> 01:34:07.171]  Well then why can't that happen here?
[01:34:07.491 --> 01:34:08.231]  It is happening here.
[01:34:08.471 --> 01:34:12.993]  And we've got Norm Stamper, the former police chief, has been speaking out about this and other issues.
[01:34:14.873 --> 01:34:16.714]  From, of all places, Seattle.
[01:34:17.394 --> 01:34:21.695]  And he's going to be joining us, Norm Stamper, coming up in the next hour.
[01:34:21.915 --> 01:34:24.016]  We'll talk about the drug war, all of it, with him.
[01:34:24.056 --> 01:34:25.016]  I'm going to your calls in a moment.
[01:34:25.316 --> 01:34:27.437]  First off, I've told you about Modiphylon.
[01:34:28.297 --> 01:34:37.721]  It is the best clean brown seaweed that comes from the Southern Hemisphere, where it's massively cleaner than Northern Hemisphere seaweed.
[01:34:37.741 --> 01:34:38.561]  The natives call it
[01:34:39.420 --> 01:34:39.860]  Kumba.
[01:34:40.381 --> 01:34:45.404]  And we have the lowest prices on Modifylun available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:34:45.425 --> 01:34:49.628]  So you win, win, win, get a great product, help your body, and support our transmission.
[01:34:49.648 --> 01:35:02.497]  So here on air, I'm taking my second dose, took one this morning, I'll take one now and then tonight, of the rich in so many key nutrients and minerals, but mainly the naturally occurring healthy iodine.
[01:35:05.558 --> 01:35:19.751]  IQ Booster, major new study out, Business Insider reported on, and then now, the totally non-GMO, pesticide-free, whole food, certified organic, Beyond Tangy Tangerine 2.0, available at InfoWarsHealth.com.
[01:35:19.771 --> 01:35:21.332]  I like the old Beyond Tangy Tangerine, too.
[01:35:21.653 --> 01:35:24.095]  This is an 8,000 ORAC organic...
[01:35:25.456 --> 01:35:25.516]  I'm
[01:35:48.482 --> 01:35:54.527]  The absolute lowest prices at Infowarshealth.com and sign up and get free shipping there on the site.
[01:35:54.847 --> 01:36:00.511]  You can also call the toll-free number at Infowarshealth.com to ask any questions or need any help signing up.
[01:36:00.832 --> 01:36:06.136]  Or if you want to be a distributor, one-time $10 fee to get your membership and get discounts, 888-789-9277.
[01:36:06.156 --> 01:36:06.196]  888-789-9277.
[01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:15.989]  Infowarshealth.com or 888-789-9277.
[01:36:16.029 --> 01:36:17.312]  You owe it to yourself and your family.
[01:36:17.593 --> 01:36:19.597]  Again, here is the new Peach Citrus Fusion.
[01:36:22.634 --> 01:36:27.979]  Even better than the original Beyond Tangy Tangerine, ladies and gentlemen, at InfoWarsHealth.com.
[01:36:28.240 --> 01:36:37.669]  And also, my favorite energy drink that's natural and healthy and doesn't give you a speed hangover later, filled with all the vitamins and minerals and turbocharging you with some stuff from green tea.
[01:36:38.289 --> 01:36:45.536]  It, of course, is the Polymers Plus, with yours truly on the cover of it, InfoWarsHealth.com, or call the toll-free number right there.
[01:36:45.576 --> 01:36:46.397]  Don't forget the new film.
[01:36:47.618 --> 01:36:52.160]  Uh, is out as well that we're distributing, and that's available at InfoWareStore.com to wake people up.
[01:36:52.621 --> 01:36:56.242]  It is state of mind, the history of mind control, the present and the future.
[01:36:56.703 --> 01:36:58.764]  So important to see, and I'm in it, many others.
[01:36:59.164 --> 01:37:00.104]  Very important film.
[01:37:00.124 --> 01:37:06.728]  Uh, and you've got Homeland Security, Future Home, a former massive mental hospital used in MKUltra Control.
[01:37:07.008 --> 01:37:11.330]  They're adding on $4.5 billion mega-torture complex.
[01:37:11.710 --> 01:37:12.931]  So that's where you'll be disappeared.
[01:37:12.971 --> 01:37:16.633]  It's got dungeons and everything for you and your family.
[01:37:17.403 --> 01:37:22.685]  Because criminals that want to run dungeons and torture people work for the psychiatric system and Homeland Security.
[01:37:22.725 --> 01:37:23.125]  Why not?
[01:37:23.585 --> 01:37:36.150]  Or else can you run child porn and snuff films and every crime under the sun and run narcotics into the country and Pat Tillman speaks out against the narcotics trafficking and you just murder him and make up a story, I was fighting Al-Qaeda and it comes out, you don't get in trouble, you know?
[01:37:36.710 --> 01:37:41.472]  So again, we've just got to admit how evil the globalists are.
[01:37:41.492 --> 01:37:44.513]  They have infested all the major posts in the federal government.
[01:37:45.247 --> 01:37:49.036]  To the point of her like, we're gonna just have Congress vote to not restrict illegal spying.
[01:37:49.056 --> 01:37:53.265]  And they're like, yeah, we're having hearings about taking your private pension funds.
[01:37:53.546 --> 01:37:54.047]  And public.
[01:37:54.228 --> 01:37:55.009]  And they will take it!
[01:37:56.820 --> 01:37:59.841]  Hell, the average person would give up their birthright and throw their kid into a blender.
[01:38:00.141 --> 01:38:04.222]  They could wear a military outfit and stand around with a machine gun scaring people.
[01:38:04.282 --> 01:38:05.783]  I mean, that's, that's being a man!
[01:38:05.803 --> 01:38:11.364]  You know, not building something, not doing something, not raising your kids up, not being honorable.
[01:38:11.784 --> 01:38:12.044]  No!
[01:38:12.064 --> 01:38:13.685]  I mean, look at Mexico, man!
[01:38:13.705 --> 01:38:18.146]  They got thousands being killed every few months, checkpoints everywhere, black ski masks.
[01:38:18.346 --> 01:38:19.026]  That's manly!
[01:38:19.406 --> 01:38:21.247]  We're gonna be just like Mexico, but better!
[01:38:23.527 --> 01:38:24.208]  Yeah, baby.
[01:38:24.668 --> 01:38:26.850]  Let's go to Carl in Washington.
[01:38:27.230 --> 01:38:28.231]  You're on the air, Carl.
[01:38:28.251 --> 01:38:28.831]  Thanks for holding.
[01:38:33.856 --> 01:38:34.536]  Yep, okay.
[01:38:34.556 --> 01:38:36.258]  Well, sounds like you don't want to talk too much, Carl.
[01:38:36.558 --> 01:38:37.539]  Oh, I'm here.
[01:38:37.559 --> 01:38:38.299]  Hey, bud.
[01:38:39.220 --> 01:38:39.581]  I'm here.
[01:38:39.601 --> 01:38:40.701]  Fuck, you're here?
[01:38:41.862 --> 01:38:42.143]  Yeah.
[01:38:43.504 --> 01:38:44.044]  Can you hear me?
[01:38:44.985 --> 01:38:46.066]  Yeah, I can hear you, bro.
[01:38:46.987 --> 01:38:47.988]  Oh, okay.
[01:38:48.088 --> 01:38:49.049]  Hey, Alex.
[01:38:49.089 --> 01:38:51.190]  I wanted to make a couple comments.
[01:38:52.222 --> 01:38:59.027]  First of all, the Paul Revere films, I haven't found a bad one yet.
[01:38:59.127 --> 01:39:02.129]  They're awesome.
[01:39:04.170 --> 01:39:04.851]  Are you still there?
[01:39:10.629 --> 01:39:12.391]  Alright, caller, I appreciate your call.
[01:39:12.571 --> 01:39:14.032]  I just couldn't understand any of that.
[01:39:14.072 --> 01:39:15.013]  We don't screen the calls.
[01:39:15.093 --> 01:39:16.614]  I might have had bad audio.
[01:39:17.615 --> 01:39:20.077]  But I really appreciate you calling.
[01:39:20.397 --> 01:39:21.438]  Dave in Colorado.
[01:39:21.478 --> 01:39:22.239]  Dave, you're on the air.
[01:39:22.259 --> 01:39:23.600]  Hi, Alex.
[01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:26.482]  I've got about three or four topics here.
[01:39:27.563 --> 01:39:28.984]  Freedomburg Convention.
[01:39:29.705 --> 01:39:30.826]  Why don't we have a Freedomburg?
[01:39:30.846 --> 01:39:32.067]  I like that guy's idea.
[01:39:32.087 --> 01:39:37.792]  Maybe we can organize enough people to where we have one subject at a time and really focus and concentrate on.
[01:39:38.442 --> 01:39:44.026]  Another one is, I don't know if you have a document database, so I can download some documents and get them out to people.
[01:39:45.307 --> 01:39:46.547]  I talk to people all the time.
[01:39:46.768 --> 01:39:50.570]  I mean, people are definitely waking up, ready to be awakened.
[01:39:51.171 --> 01:39:52.572]  I've gotten the feedback from it.
[01:39:53.512 --> 01:39:54.633]  Positive note on that end.
[01:39:55.954 --> 01:39:58.415]  Globalist Amnesty Program.
[01:39:58.515 --> 01:40:03.599]  Let's get these globalists in fighting amongst each other for a piece of life.
[01:40:03.719 --> 01:40:08.082]  Of course, we won't let them get very far or have any power, but they can live.
[01:40:09.444 --> 01:40:14.071]  Another one is the Catholic Catechism.
[01:40:14.211 --> 01:40:20.461]  I would like your comments on that, what it has to say, because I see a lot of freedom, a lot of humanity there.
[01:40:22.512 --> 01:40:25.253]  And I'm not giving up, never filed taxes, never will.
[01:40:25.313 --> 01:40:26.693]  I'm with CoCash on that one.
[01:40:27.093 --> 01:40:28.514]  Disfund this organization.
[01:40:29.174 --> 01:40:29.674]  Your comment?
[01:40:29.994 --> 01:40:31.815]  Well, I don't know what we do at this point.
[01:40:31.915 --> 01:40:36.216]  I mean, this has happened in history over and over again everywhere.
[01:40:36.516 --> 01:40:37.597]  We know where it goes.
[01:40:38.017 --> 01:40:46.079]  You get rid of checks and balances, rule of law, you become an immoral people, the very worst will take over because they want to exercise mass death.
[01:40:46.359 --> 01:40:48.900]  They want burning cities, piles of dead children,
[01:40:49.760 --> 01:40:51.721]  And normal people go, but I don't want that.
[01:40:52.101 --> 01:40:53.022]  That's not going to happen.
[01:40:53.122 --> 01:40:58.564]  They don't understand psychopaths, sadists, control freaks, demons, hell force.
[01:40:59.325 --> 01:41:00.885]  And so it gets released.
[01:41:01.045 --> 01:41:03.646]  And now the whole bottom's falling out.
[01:41:03.967 --> 01:41:05.187]  It's like, yeah, we're corrupt.
[01:41:05.607 --> 01:41:06.788]  Yeah, we bring the drugs in.
[01:41:06.808 --> 01:41:08.289]  Yeah, we're putting poison in your water.
[01:41:09.369 --> 01:41:12.431]  And the general public is so poisoned, they don't even know what's happening.
[01:41:12.471 --> 01:41:13.012]  God bless you.
[01:41:13.092 --> 01:41:13.933]  I appreciate your call.
[01:41:14.433 --> 01:41:24.200]  Yeah, I mean, you see attacks on all basic Christian religion, because it talks about family and not having abortion, and because God is above the state.
[01:41:24.781 --> 01:41:28.043]  And the state wants to be God, so it wants to get rid of its competition.
[01:41:28.284 --> 01:41:32.066]  Whether you believe in God or not, the atheists are like, we don't have God-given rights.
[01:41:32.126 --> 01:41:34.869]  The state gives us our rights, so the state can take it away.
[01:41:35.802 --> 01:41:40.005]  Even if you're an atheist, you should say, I believe I don't get my rights from the state.
[01:41:40.145 --> 01:41:41.566]  I have an individual right.
[01:41:41.586 --> 01:41:43.067]  Well, they go, you're just an animal, actually.
[01:41:43.087 --> 01:41:43.887]  You don't have free will.
[01:41:44.087 --> 01:41:46.949]  So let us decide what you're going to do, because free will doesn't matter.
[01:41:46.969 --> 01:41:48.010]  We just want to make the decisions.
[01:41:48.430 --> 01:41:49.530]  You don't need to make decisions.
[01:41:49.891 --> 01:41:52.272]  You can't make decisions, but we're going to make them for you.
[01:41:52.452 --> 01:41:53.513]  It's all mind games.
[01:41:54.133 --> 01:41:54.874]  Good to hear from you.
[01:41:55.574 --> 01:41:57.656]  JB in Hawaii, you're on the air.
[01:41:57.696 --> 01:41:58.036]  Go ahead.
[01:41:59.619 --> 01:42:00.479]  Hey, good morning, Alex.
[01:42:00.639 --> 01:42:07.321]  I'm calling about something interesting with the NSA Google connection there that you've been documenting for years.
[01:42:07.341 --> 01:42:15.884]  So I had signed up for the Google Voice, which they, as you know, give free phone calls through integrated in their Gmail service.
[01:42:17.009 --> 01:42:42.263]  And for the longest time I would get voicemail you know an email sent to my account saying you've got a voicemail from a random number that you don't know and the voicemail might be one minute it might be 15 minutes of people going about their daily business and you're being recorded and it's being transmitted by their cell phone and then it's
[01:42:43.217 --> 01:42:44.858]  Yeah, let me explain what's going on.
[01:42:44.878 --> 01:42:49.141]  When you build back doors into the dishwashers, the computers, the smartphones, all of it, it puts added cost on everybody.
[01:43:09.452 --> 01:43:15.974]  And then it causes a lot of compatibility problems because everything is really built to spy and control you.
[01:43:16.654 --> 01:43:20.555]  And then it allows other third party groups to break in and use the data.
[01:43:20.875 --> 01:43:23.175]  Then the government uses that as an excuse to get more power.
[01:43:24.136 --> 01:43:33.258]  And then they're using face scanning technology to tell if you're wealthy or not to then charge you extra or to tell what you'll buy even if it costs too much if you're poor.
[01:43:33.918 --> 01:43:37.919]  That's what the customer loyalty cards have always been about is to track your behavior so they can rip you off.
[01:43:38.539 --> 01:43:41.520]  I mean, it's all just a giant gaming system.
[01:43:41.781 --> 01:43:43.521]  People say, well, why should I be private?
[01:43:43.822 --> 01:43:44.862]  You know, I have nothing to hide.
[01:43:45.422 --> 01:43:47.383]  Well, then why don't you leave your house open at night?
[01:43:47.443 --> 01:43:48.864]  Because there's bad people out there.
[01:43:49.364 --> 01:43:50.305]  Well, it's the same thing.
[01:43:51.325 --> 01:43:59.129]  They are using all this to have an advantage, economically, to dominate and control you, and to figure out how to game you.
[01:43:59.369 --> 01:44:07.713]  The smart meters, 20 years ago, when they were coming out with them, said, we're going to control what's in your house, we're going to charge you at peak times, and we're going to use this to increase prices.
[01:44:08.433 --> 01:44:09.314]  And they're now doing it!
[01:44:09.934 --> 01:44:13.497]  And so, we're just saying, oh, we trust you!
[01:44:13.517 --> 01:44:16.099]  Because it's bad to not trust people you don't know.
[01:44:16.660 --> 01:44:22.584]  See, you're supposed to trust people you don't know, trust the government, that's virtue, but don't trust your family.
[01:44:22.965 --> 01:44:30.491]  All the sitcoms, all the dramas, fight with your family, fight with your husband, fight with your wife, trust the government.
[01:44:31.031 --> 01:44:32.993]  It's the opposite of how things should work.
[01:44:34.028 --> 01:44:53.135]  And so, yeah, I mean, you get calls on your cell phone where people are breathing, you get other people's voicemails, because it's all run through these big hubs now, and a lot of the compatibility problems, it just compounds technological problems that everything is having snooping hubs put in front of it.
[01:44:54.776 --> 01:44:55.116]  I see.
[01:44:56.056 --> 01:45:00.718]  Yes, I just wanted to put that out there, you know, that, or is it them, you know, right in our face with it?
[01:45:01.038 --> 01:45:02.759]  If I could, just one thing I wanted to say,
[01:45:03.849 --> 01:45:08.052]  I agree with you that resistance is victory, and you gotta resist them every time you can.
[01:45:08.072 --> 01:45:09.392]  I always opt out.
[01:45:09.713 --> 01:45:14.075]  I always make a point to tell them, you guys put the underpants bomber on the plane.
[01:45:15.496 --> 01:45:16.036]  They admit it.
[01:45:16.096 --> 01:45:18.318]  I pull up the documentation.
[01:45:18.718 --> 01:45:31.746]  I've got, you know, I've been there, where the GSA come around, and then I have to, you know, they hassle you, they give you the pat-down, and then I'm forced to stand there, right at the line, and record, you know, the rest of the time there.
[01:45:33.352 --> 01:45:48.421]  No that's it, they're teaching you that you're a suspect when of course the people running the country stage the terror so they can get trillions in no-bid contracts and take over society and spy on everyone and get away with bloody murder and invade whatever countries they want.
[01:45:48.681 --> 01:45:49.922]  Of course they did it!
[01:45:50.182 --> 01:45:51.804]  Of course they financed terrorists.
[01:45:51.844 --> 01:45:52.644]  I appreciate your call.
[01:45:52.925 --> 01:45:55.166]  Then they say, oh, you're saying there's no terrorists.
[01:45:55.527 --> 01:45:57.008]  No, there's real Muslim extremists.
[01:45:57.268 --> 01:45:59.250]  The point is the Globalist funds them publicly.
[01:45:59.530 --> 01:46:02.272]  And do I get apologized to when all that gets admitted?
[01:46:02.633 --> 01:46:04.354]  No, I'm that much worse.
[01:46:04.874 --> 01:46:05.835]  Oh, I'm so horrible.
[01:46:06.135 --> 01:46:08.878]  Look, people have a decision to make.
[01:46:10.419 --> 01:46:16.324]  We're going to lose everything because we're letting corruption grow, or we can wake up and admit we're in trouble and try to turn the tide.
[01:46:17.403 --> 01:46:29.976]  But if the general public, not our listeners, but new listeners, people that are in denial... Last night at about 9 o'clock I was still working and I said, let's go get some food up at this local restaurant slash bar.
[01:46:30.536 --> 01:46:34.540]  So we're in there eating and people are coming over shaking my hand.
[01:46:35.602 --> 01:46:36.803]  People are taking pictures with us.
[01:46:37.083 --> 01:46:39.546]  We were having a meeting about a film we're making.
[01:46:40.640 --> 01:46:45.322]  It was about 10 o'clock at night and this guy sits down at a table and he's just bugging his eyes out at me.
[01:46:45.982 --> 01:46:54.805]  You could tell he was like a trendy government type who thought he was the boss and I just looked at him and said, oh you're with the government, you're the boss, you're looking at me in a sardonic way and I'm supposed to feel small?
[01:46:56.185 --> 01:47:01.727]  And then he didn't like that and got up and went and sat down at the bar and then I saw him turn and look as
[01:47:02.998 --> 01:47:10.805]  Two guys with their beautiful girlfriends came over and were shaking my hand and saying hi and stuff and it just made him really mad because he was seeing Liberty was popular.
[01:47:11.265 --> 01:47:17.430]  See, they want to sell the idea of Jenny McCarthy's a kook, don't give her a show, ban Mound Cow Show, get Alex Jones off the air.
[01:47:17.651 --> 01:47:18.771]  It's all peer pressure.
[01:47:19.432 --> 01:47:23.335]  And because these are collectivists and they want to make you feel uncomfortable.
[01:47:23.596 --> 01:47:28.260]  Hey, I'm not uncomfortable when some cowardly piece of crap like you, excuse my French,
[01:47:29.101 --> 01:47:32.727]  Uh, he's sitting there trying to glower at me, like that's gonna shake me up.
[01:47:33.008 --> 01:47:34.611]  That just makes me work that much harder.
[01:47:36.213 --> 01:47:38.457]  And I worked till 10.30 last night and went home.
[01:47:39.199 --> 01:47:39.980]  I slept good.
[01:47:41.257 --> 01:47:42.058]  We're going to beat you.
[01:47:42.078 --> 01:47:43.339]  You people are going to beat yourselves.
[01:47:43.359 --> 01:47:44.420]  Because here's the secret.
[01:47:44.600 --> 01:47:46.722]  You have a hard coating inside of you.
[01:47:46.782 --> 01:47:47.723]  You're evil on top.
[01:47:48.303 --> 01:47:50.425]  But deep down you've still got human instinct.
[01:47:50.966 --> 01:47:53.628]  You people will sabotage yourselves in the end.
[01:47:53.928 --> 01:47:56.190]  We've just got to resist so the collapse isn't too bad.
[01:47:56.450 --> 01:47:58.112]  So we're in place to pick up the pieces.
[01:47:58.472 --> 01:48:00.274]  You people are born to lose.
[01:48:00.794 --> 01:48:06.357]  You are a bunch of cowardly filth, and that's why you try to go get in groups to come dominate individuals.
[01:48:06.737 --> 01:48:12.040]  You hate winners, you hate beautiful people, you hate smart people, and you can go straight to hell.
[01:48:12.240 --> 01:48:12.540]  Okay?
[01:48:12.881 --> 01:48:14.481]  I mean, you know, that's what it comes down to.
[01:48:15.022 --> 01:48:16.322]  You people have failed.
[01:48:17.103 --> 01:48:17.403]  Okay?
[01:48:17.623 --> 01:48:22.266]  You will fail, you know you're a joke, that's why you hate everybody, because you're so ugly inside.
[01:48:23.106 --> 01:48:24.187]  I know who you are!
[01:48:24.207 --> 01:48:26.168]  I know who you are!
[01:48:26.188 --> 01:48:27.849]  I can assess you.
[01:48:28.951 --> 01:48:32.852]  Because I've got all my human instincts right there that the system works to turn off.
[01:48:33.332 --> 01:48:34.532]  I've got all my discernment.
[01:48:35.753 --> 01:48:36.933]  I've got all my intuition.
[01:48:36.973 --> 01:48:37.933]  I've got all my intellect.
[01:48:38.173 --> 01:48:39.134]  I've got all my history.
[01:48:39.174 --> 01:48:40.174]  I've got all my understanding.
[01:48:40.514 --> 01:48:42.054]  My only problem is I overheat.
[01:48:42.494 --> 01:48:44.255]  I get so angry, so frustrated.
[01:48:45.115 --> 01:48:50.216]  The caller goes, yeah, I heard you say that the underwear bomber was put on the plane by the government.
[01:48:50.576 --> 01:48:51.277]  I went and looked it up.
[01:48:51.337 --> 01:48:51.777]  It was true.
[01:48:51.817 --> 01:48:53.997]  Yeah, C-SPAN, Detroit Free Press.
[01:48:54.637 --> 01:48:56.958]  I knew a month and a half before because eyewitnesses we had on air.
[01:48:59.505 --> 01:49:06.029]  And I already knew when the eyewitnesses were credible just from what they were saying, their history, who they were, and how they were talking, and the M.O.
[01:49:06.810 --> 01:49:07.490]  of the Globalist.
[01:49:09.491 --> 01:49:22.920]  I knew that the guest we had on that were witnesses to that bombing, that firecracker bombing, you have a firecracker bombing and some drugged up Mutalib's pants, and you get to roll in $5 billion in naked scanners the last three years.
[01:49:23.500 --> 01:49:24.401]  That's pretty good business.
[01:49:26.138 --> 01:49:30.800]  Boston Bomber's brother, CIA, on record, back of the newspaper.
[01:49:32.881 --> 01:49:36.183]  They put him on the cover of the Rolling Stones saying he's guilty.
[01:49:36.844 --> 01:49:38.805]  The media spins it saying they're glorifying him.
[01:49:39.045 --> 01:49:40.205]  No they're not, they're framing him.
[01:49:40.686 --> 01:49:42.126]  The guy already said, I'm not guilty.
[01:49:42.767 --> 01:49:44.147]  They're probably torturing him right now.
[01:49:44.528 --> 01:49:45.868]  He'll end up saying he's guilty later.
[01:49:45.888 --> 01:49:51.071]  If they have to drug him up or electroshock him until he thinks he's the Hamburglar.
[01:49:54.462 --> 01:49:56.083]  This is a government that tortures on record.
[01:49:57.044 --> 01:50:02.428]  And they've put an NDA into law so they can tell special forces, you go kill that talk show host.
[01:50:02.688 --> 01:50:04.730]  You go kill Michael Hastings.
[01:50:05.210 --> 01:50:05.911]  You go kill him.
[01:50:06.211 --> 01:50:08.212]  And you got the president's authorization right here.
[01:50:08.673 --> 01:50:09.153]  Yes, sir.
[01:50:09.814 --> 01:50:11.735]  What they don't tell you is they're going to kill you next.
[01:50:13.056 --> 01:50:16.158]  They'll kill you down the road in the big purge that's coming.
[01:50:16.178 --> 01:50:20.121]  And you all just think you're going to sell out to it and you're going to have some future.
[01:50:20.402 --> 01:50:22.043]  You're not going to have a future doing this.
[01:50:24.815 --> 01:50:25.896]  So I'm beyond you.
[01:50:25.916 --> 01:50:30.138]  I mean, I mean, that's really the best part about this is I don't care what you scum think about me.
[01:50:30.518 --> 01:50:31.739]  I don't care what you do to me.
[01:50:32.439 --> 01:50:34.840]  I'm committed, and I know who you are, and I see you are.
[01:50:34.860 --> 01:50:35.921]  And by the way, I can smell you.
[01:50:36.881 --> 01:50:39.162]  I can smell your spirit, and boy, it doesn't smell good.
[01:50:39.463 --> 01:50:41.504]  They say angels smell like milk and cookies.
[01:50:42.084 --> 01:50:45.786]  You smell like a dead rat stuck in the ventilation system.
[01:50:46.626 --> 01:50:47.567]  You look even worse.
[01:50:49.929 --> 01:50:50.770]  Look at you people!
[01:50:51.570 --> 01:50:52.171]  Pathetic!
[01:50:52.211 --> 01:50:53.372]  I'm so glad I'm not you!
[01:50:53.392 --> 01:50:54.873]  I'm so glad!
[01:50:54.953 --> 01:50:56.174]  Thank God I'm not you!
[01:50:56.734 --> 01:50:57.415]  Thank God!
[01:50:57.455 --> 01:50:58.075]  Hallelujah!
[01:50:58.516 --> 01:50:59.116]  Be right back!

[01:54:01.348 --> 01:54:04.630]  I always fought the globalists because I have love, and that's my main engine.
[01:54:06.271 --> 01:54:07.511]  You can feel it, can't you?
[01:54:08.172 --> 01:54:10.233]  Boom!

[01:54:33.178 --> 01:54:34.940]  Love it, love it, love it, love it.
[01:54:36.822 --> 01:54:37.743]  Alex Jones.
[01:54:38.063 --> 01:54:40.246]  I mean, I do this because I care.
[01:54:40.446 --> 01:54:42.548]  Overnights on the Talk Superstation.
[01:54:46.480 --> 01:54:52.381]  I tell you, we got some great audio editors around here, but the folks that did that at that affiliate are just amazing.
[01:54:53.202 --> 01:54:53.902]  You guys like that?
[01:54:53.962 --> 01:54:54.402]  I like it.
[01:54:54.442 --> 01:54:55.422]  I am a love machine.
[01:54:56.402 --> 01:54:57.203]  You know, that's what happens.
[01:54:57.263 --> 01:54:58.363]  I do do this too much.
[01:54:58.403 --> 01:55:00.123]  Three hours a day, running this whole thing.
[01:55:00.543 --> 01:55:04.764]  I just start flipping out, because I mean, I know they killed Pat Tillman.
[01:55:04.804 --> 01:55:05.425]  It's on record.
[01:55:06.085 --> 01:55:07.845]  I know they did the underwear bombing.
[01:55:08.645 --> 01:55:10.666]  We know the federal agency that got him on the plane.
[01:55:11.912 --> 01:55:14.113]  We know they run Al Qaeda now.
[01:55:14.173 --> 01:55:15.934]  We know they're putting poison in the water.
[01:55:16.234 --> 01:55:18.054]  We know they're trying to break down the family.
[01:55:18.294 --> 01:55:19.415]  I mean, turn on the news.
[01:55:19.455 --> 01:55:21.075]  That's globalist propaganda.
[01:55:21.335 --> 01:55:22.376]  Turn on a sitcom.
[01:55:22.796 --> 01:55:24.157]  All that anti-family stuff.
[01:55:24.177 --> 01:55:25.217]  I mean, this is sick!
[01:55:27.158 --> 01:55:31.619]  And it's just, I can't believe they're running all over us and we're putting up with it.
[01:55:32.019 --> 01:55:34.100]  I can't believe Media Matters run by the White House.
[01:55:34.580 --> 01:55:36.241]  I've seen their own internal videos they've put out.
[01:55:36.281 --> 01:55:38.442]  A bunch of college kids under White House people.
[01:55:38.782 --> 01:55:41.363]  You guys really have signed on to basically like Adolf Hitler?
[01:55:42.625 --> 01:55:44.847]  And you're like, oh no, we're fighting the right-wingers.
[01:55:44.908 --> 01:55:45.528]  Yeah, right.
[01:55:45.768 --> 01:55:46.689]  Sure.
[01:55:46.750 --> 01:55:47.550]  Yeah, right.
[01:55:48.552 --> 01:55:51.074]  I mean, just such flaming authoritarians.
[01:55:51.835 --> 01:55:55.019]  And I just hope you enjoy what happens to you and your family at the hands of this.
[01:55:55.419 --> 01:55:55.960]  Remember.
[01:55:56.980 --> 01:56:07.053]  Remember, you know, when your mom's 45 and gets diagnosed with cancer, or you have a kid and they get the second round of shots and never talk again, you'll become a listener then.
[01:56:07.113 --> 01:56:14.502]  I can't tell you how many radio hosts, TV hosts, government people, FBI agents, billionaires, you name it, hear the show, laugh at it.
[01:56:15.512 --> 01:56:22.634]  And then get set up, or their kid gets brain damage from a shot, or they notice both their neighbor's kids have cancer, and then their wife gets it.
[01:56:22.694 --> 01:56:25.534]  I mean, look, look, nobody's getting out of this, okay?
[01:56:26.014 --> 01:56:26.975]  Unless we turn around.
[01:56:27.695 --> 01:56:28.675]  That's what I'm telling you.
[01:56:28.835 --> 01:56:30.275]  There is no giving in to this.
[01:56:30.455 --> 01:56:31.716]  There is no selling out.
[01:56:33.536 --> 01:56:38.757]  It's like jumping into a pit of rattlesnakes and going, I'm gonna make a deal with them.
[01:56:40.417 --> 01:56:42.478]  There's no making a deal with this, folks.
[01:56:43.854 --> 01:56:48.956]  And I've said that a trillion times, but it just comes back to me that I have gone kind of crazy, though.
[01:56:49.857 --> 01:56:53.618]  I mean, the stuff I talk about is real and true, but yeah, it's gotten to me.
[01:56:54.658 --> 01:57:00.361]  It's gotten to me, too, to just watch most people just go on by in a trance, like it's no big deal.
[01:57:00.381 --> 01:57:01.201]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[01:57:01.521 --> 01:57:02.702]  James in Kentucky.
[01:57:03.402 --> 01:57:04.463]  James, you're on the air.
[01:57:04.523 --> 01:57:05.043]  Welcome, sir.
[01:57:06.118 --> 01:57:06.939]  Oh, thank you, Alex.
[01:57:07.299 --> 01:57:08.199]  First-time caller.
[01:57:08.539 --> 01:57:09.680]  I really appreciate it.
[01:57:10.060 --> 01:57:10.681]  Just a few things.
[01:57:10.861 --> 01:57:14.043]  I'd like to go ahead and comment and then ask you a question after this.
[01:57:14.243 --> 01:57:17.224]  I'd like to see you do more mainstream TV.
[01:57:17.284 --> 01:57:21.227]  You know, I think that'd really help out, you know, to get the word out there.
[01:57:21.267 --> 01:57:25.429]  I know I learned about you on History Channel when you did that show with Brad Meltzer.
[01:57:25.469 --> 01:57:29.612]  So, I think that would just be huge to really opening things up and getting people to know things.
[01:57:30.032 --> 01:57:30.852]  Here's the deal.
[01:57:30.952 --> 01:57:31.673]  If I do a Brad...
[01:57:32.253 --> 01:57:32.473]  I mean,
[01:58:02.918 --> 01:58:03.478]  Yes, sir.
[01:58:03.518 --> 01:58:06.639]  I would take whatever opportunity you could possibly in the future.
[01:58:06.659 --> 01:58:09.640]  I just think that's huge, you know, towards getting the word out there.
[01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:14.821]  And then also, I'd like to let people know that cannabis truly does cure cancer.
[01:58:14.881 --> 01:58:22.923]  And if they go on YouTube to Run From the Cure with Rick Simpson, they can learn about hemp oil and how it truly does cure cancer.
[01:58:22.943 --> 01:58:23.183]  We need to
[01:58:23.763 --> 01:58:26.686]  Well, there's a lot of people that say they have cures to things.
[01:58:27.026 --> 01:58:36.395]  There are major studies showing hemp oil has amazing effects on not getting cancer as quickly and can help mitigate it.
[01:58:36.715 --> 01:58:39.398]  But I think saying things are cures, hmm.
[01:58:41.420 --> 01:58:42.961]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:43.001 --> 01:58:46.524]  And I don't want people to end up getting cancer, think something's going to cure them, and they blame me.
[01:58:46.544 --> 01:58:47.505]  You know what I mean?
[01:58:47.545 --> 01:58:47.786]  Come on.
[01:58:51.226 --> 01:58:53.987]  Protecting your home with a security system is a must.
[01:58:54.227 --> 01:59:00.230]  But when it comes to protecting your family, your home, and belongings, there's no need to sign a long-term contract.
[01:59:00.590 --> 01:59:06.973]  Listen, there is some real scum in the alarm business cashing in by locking you into long, punishing contracts.
[01:59:07.393 --> 01:59:09.354]  Not with SimpliSafe Home Security.
[01:59:09.675 --> 01:59:10.735]  They're the good guys.
[01:59:11.016 --> 01:59:13.717]  You can trust SimpliSafe to protect your family.
[01:59:14.098 --> 01:59:18.400]  SimpliSafe was created by a Harvard Business School engineer, and it's revolutionary.

[01:59:53.798 --> 01:59:55.719]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.179 --> 01:59:59.000]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.489 --> 02:00:09.673]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.333 --> 02:00:11.134]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.935 --> 02:00:12.836]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.476 --> 02:00:17.100]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.660 --> 02:00:21.744]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:29.858 --> 02:00:32.360]  Alright, into hour number three, ton of news coming up.
[02:00:32.400 --> 02:00:36.043]  Got the former Seattle Police Chief, Norm Stamper, on.
[02:00:36.824 --> 02:00:38.525]  We all watched during the WTO riots.
[02:00:38.545 --> 02:00:40.427]  How about the drug war and a lot more coming up.
[02:00:40.527 --> 02:00:41.608]  Let's go to your calls here.
[02:00:42.809 --> 02:00:46.071]  Let's talk to Kyle in South Carolina.
[02:00:46.111 --> 02:00:46.932]  Kyle, you're on the air.
[02:00:46.972 --> 02:00:47.312]  Go ahead.
[02:00:48.653 --> 02:00:49.334]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:00:50.195 --> 02:00:50.735]  Two things.
[02:00:51.095 --> 02:00:54.738]  I just want to say what's up to all the Columinati down there on Facebook.
[02:00:55.179 --> 02:00:56.199]  Columinati Network.
[02:00:56.219 --> 02:00:56.780]  Check us out.
[02:00:57.572 --> 02:01:11.792]  And I want to apologize for my home state's representative, Mr. Lindsey Graham, and there is an independent, there's nothing to do about it because there's no Democratic Party really to speak of in the state.
[02:01:12.301 --> 02:01:14.703]  Yeah, but I'd rather put a communist in than Lindsey Graham.
[02:01:14.723 --> 02:01:18.845]  You can take one look at that guy and tell that he's a homicidal degenerate.
[02:01:19.286 --> 02:01:23.668]  I mean, and I don't mean physically, he just looks like a raving demon.
[02:01:23.909 --> 02:01:29.492]  And the stuff he does, and well, he said things about torturing people and we will get you and we will torture you.
[02:01:29.752 --> 02:01:33.675]  I mean, that is a creepy guy that I imagine dresses up like a clown in basements.
[02:01:33.735 --> 02:01:36.437]  I mean, I'm sorry, psychically, I'm serious.
[02:01:37.157 --> 02:01:38.517]  I got the sense, folks.
[02:01:38.597 --> 02:01:43.638]  I mean, I hate to admit this on air, but all I see is him in a clown outfit doing horrible things.
[02:01:43.678 --> 02:01:44.078]  I'm sorry.
[02:01:44.918 --> 02:01:46.219]  Guys, do you see that same thing?
[02:01:46.239 --> 02:01:48.179]  I mean, put that image of him back up.
[02:01:48.219 --> 02:01:48.819]  He screams.
[02:01:49.259 --> 02:01:50.700]  I dress up like a clown in basements.
[02:01:50.740 --> 02:01:51.320]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[02:01:51.340 --> 02:01:52.340]  Go ahead.
[02:01:53.360 --> 02:01:55.880]  Well, what is he beating the war drum again for?
[02:01:55.920 --> 02:01:58.221]  We ain't heard nothing from Iran, you know, about Iran.
[02:01:58.241 --> 02:01:59.121]  Because that's demonic.
[02:01:59.161 --> 02:02:00.301]  The demons that run his life.
[02:02:01.401 --> 02:02:02.662]  The clown demon, you know.
[02:02:02.762 --> 02:02:03.222]  Oh, Lindsey.
[02:02:04.884 --> 02:02:07.665]  The clown demon, the clown demon demands more dead children.
[02:02:07.685 --> 02:02:10.066]  The only way he can legally get it done is a big war.
[02:02:10.086 --> 02:02:11.806]  When he talks about wars, he gets all excited.
[02:02:11.826 --> 02:02:13.006]  That's going, huh, huh.
[02:02:13.026 --> 02:02:14.107]  I mean, have you seen it?
[02:02:14.147 --> 02:02:15.287]  We ought to do a video on him.
[02:02:15.347 --> 02:02:16.087]  I'm not joking.
[02:02:16.567 --> 02:02:19.108]  I mean, that's definitely a demonic piece of trash right there.
[02:02:20.068 --> 02:02:23.389]  Well, he'll be here a hundred years like Thurman if he lives that long.
[02:02:24.570 --> 02:02:26.570]  Lindsey Graham, that is a disgusting person.
[02:02:26.890 --> 02:02:28.551]  I'm sorry, I shouldn't talk bad about people.
[02:02:29.326 --> 02:02:30.126]  You can do it for him.
[02:02:30.487 --> 02:02:32.067]  I'm telling you, I appreciate your call, sir.
[02:02:32.107 --> 02:02:32.928]  He is our friend.
[02:02:33.548 --> 02:02:34.608]  Actually, I like Lindsey Graham.
[02:02:34.628 --> 02:02:35.689]  He's a wonderful person.
[02:02:36.049 --> 02:02:37.750]  Wants our guns, wants open borders.
[02:02:38.330 --> 02:02:43.032]  He's about like John McCain, and just is a total war... I've seen videos where he talks about torching us.
[02:02:43.252 --> 02:02:45.473]  We will get you, and we will do whatever we want.
[02:02:46.794 --> 02:02:54.357]  And I'm like... I mean, there's few people like when I just run jumping, you know, like, out of my own skin, away from him.
[02:02:55.437 --> 02:02:56.278]  Can you imagine?
[02:02:58.200 --> 02:02:59.201]  What's his wife thinking?
[02:02:59.281 --> 02:03:00.402]  Oh, he doesn't have a wife, does he?
[02:03:01.442 --> 02:03:03.364]  Maybe he's married to a demonic clown, actually.
[02:03:03.444 --> 02:03:06.206]  That's a little secret there.
[02:03:06.606 --> 02:03:07.507]  Let's talk to Keith.
[02:03:07.547 --> 02:03:09.028]  I'm sorry, former police officer.
[02:03:09.268 --> 02:03:11.050]  Let's talk about gun laws, he says in the comment.
[02:03:11.310 --> 02:03:12.191]  Keith, you're on the air, sir.
[02:03:13.547 --> 02:03:14.307]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:03:14.848 --> 02:03:16.188]  I just want to thank you real quick.
[02:03:16.208 --> 02:03:22.891]  You're the one who woke me up so much so that I went ahead and on the 4th of July opened my own website and that's where my problems started.
[02:03:23.491 --> 02:03:29.713]  I start now feeling and experiencing a small amount of what you must majorly experience.
[02:03:30.614 --> 02:03:32.454]  I've had the cops come to my door.
[02:03:33.255 --> 02:03:41.538]  I've had them take pictures of my trash cans, what's inside my trash, but the biggest slap in the face was when I had to go through DC recently
[02:03:42.478 --> 02:03:45.039]  I can't carry my gun anymore legally in D.C.
[02:03:45.059 --> 02:03:46.920]  because I'm no longer a cop there.
[02:03:48.521 --> 02:03:56.744]  I pulled up to an intersection, stopped at the light, then I was recognized by someone on the side of the street as a cop.
[02:03:57.605 --> 02:03:59.245]  His friend started running over to the car.
[02:03:59.765 --> 02:04:10.250]  I went through the red light, got pictured through, or got caught on camera doing it, and after an appeal process of trying to, you know, explain why I went through the red light and everything,
[02:04:10.871 --> 02:04:15.742]  The DMV has decided that it doesn't matter if I was trying to save my own life.
[02:04:16.238 --> 02:04:19.080]  I still went through the light, and I have to pay them a $150 fine.
[02:04:19.160 --> 02:04:20.401]  Well, let me break down what happens.
[02:04:20.421 --> 02:04:23.542]  They really target former military and police, as they admit.
[02:04:24.003 --> 02:04:24.983]  Any purge does that.
[02:04:25.023 --> 02:04:26.704]  Hitler, Stalin, Mao, they all do that.
[02:04:27.605 --> 02:04:31.407]  And, you know, I would sue them over getting in your trash.
[02:04:31.507 --> 02:04:32.808]  I would go follow them around.
[02:04:33.268 --> 02:04:38.331]  Because, you see, it's actually when you're small at first is when they try to scare you off.
[02:04:38.732 --> 02:04:41.934]  So you don't grow into, you fit a profile of a leader.
[02:04:42.674 --> 02:04:43.835]  And so that's why they do that.
[02:04:43.975 --> 02:04:46.778]  And the answer is, intensify what you do ten times.
[02:04:47.859 --> 02:04:51.803]  And, you know, just basically seethe with resistance.
[02:04:52.564 --> 02:04:55.727]  And just wake people up and stand up for freedom and liberty.
[02:04:56.127 --> 02:04:56.728]  God bless you.
[02:04:56.748 --> 02:04:58.289]  More calls coming up and more news.
[02:04:58.309 --> 02:04:58.750]  Stay with us.
[02:05:01.838 --> 02:05:03.079]  What does freedom mean to you?
[02:05:03.099 --> 02:05:05.981]  How about the freedom to take control of your own future?
[02:05:06.241 --> 02:05:09.743]  At eFoods Direct, we're again celebrating Food Freedom Month.
[02:05:10.063 --> 02:05:19.188]  In July, for every $329 you spend on our highly nutritious, great-tasting food, you will receive a $190 Patriot Pack free.
[02:05:19.448 --> 02:05:24.051]  For example, purchase a six-month supply and get three Patriot Packs free.
[02:05:24.271 --> 02:05:30.955]  The Patriot Pack is a 24-day supply of eFoods Quick Fix, easy-to-store food, plus stove, fuel,
[02:05:31.175 --> 02:05:32.116]  We're good to go.
[02:06:01.335 --> 02:06:05.922]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[02:06:06.062 --> 02:06:09.026]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[02:06:09.186 --> 02:06:14.413]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[02:06:14.754 --> 02:06:16.356]  It all comes down to one thing.
[02:06:16.656 --> 02:06:17.977]  We are what we eat.
[02:06:18.297 --> 02:06:22.639]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[02:06:22.979 --> 02:06:26.941]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and Big Pharma runoff.
[02:06:27.181 --> 02:06:29.522]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[02:06:29.762 --> 02:06:35.685]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[02:07:05.214 --> 02:07:10.495]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[02:07:10.715 --> 02:07:12.615]  Billions of dollars have been spent
[02:07:12.995 --> 02:07:18.257]  Privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[02:07:18.437 --> 02:07:27.660]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[02:07:27.760 --> 02:07:34.743]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[02:07:34.963 --> 02:07:37.764]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[02:07:37.984 --> 02:07:44.787]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse, but demand a war.
[02:07:45.047 --> 02:07:46.348]  Oh, there's another one!
[02:07:46.368 --> 02:07:47.608]  Another plane just hit!
[02:07:47.628 --> 02:07:48.429]  State of Mind.
[02:07:48.709 --> 02:07:50.109]  Because there's a war on.

[02:08:06.889 --> 02:08:12.472]  Hello, this is Hank Hill, and I'm telling you what, you need to listen to Alex Jones.
[02:08:12.992 --> 02:08:13.512]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:08:14.313 --> 02:08:21.216]  Infowars.com.
[02:08:21.497 --> 02:08:27.740]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:42.961 --> 02:08:52.801]  Norm Stamper is known for his roles as the Chief of Police, the department responsible for Seattle's response to the protests at WTO Conference 99.
[02:08:54.602 --> 02:08:59.246]  And of course, he's also written the best-selling book, Breaking Rank, that I've read great reviews of.
[02:08:59.266 --> 02:09:02.730]  In fact, I meant to get him on years ago, but was unable to, so I'm glad he's here with us.
[02:09:03.550 --> 02:09:12.839]  He's a top cop's expose of the dark side of American policing, and has starred in the marijuana documentary, The Union, the business behind getting high.
[02:09:13.379 --> 02:09:16.002]  Copssaylegalizeddrugs.com.
[02:09:16.662 --> 02:09:20.045]  And my whole issue is, lots of areas of Europe have decriminalized
[02:09:20.747 --> 02:09:23.460]  And crime rates in some areas, 50%, they drop everywhere.
[02:09:23.560 --> 02:09:24.786]  It takes the money out of it.
[02:09:26.710 --> 02:09:29.811]  And he joins us now to talk about that.
[02:09:30.151 --> 02:09:40.614]  But I gotta tell you, before we go there, just looking at the whole landscape of policing, I know you've spoken out since you resigned, and I appreciate that fact.
[02:09:40.654 --> 02:09:42.975]  I've agreed with a lot of what I've seen you say on the news, sir.
[02:09:43.355 --> 02:09:45.116]  Did you see the Wall Street Journal two days ago?
[02:09:45.416 --> 02:09:47.096]  The rise of the warrior cop.
[02:09:47.637 --> 02:09:50.978]  It's time to reconsider the militarization of American policing.
[02:09:51.018 --> 02:09:54.679]  I mean, military kills people and breaks things and occupies.
[02:09:55.672 --> 02:10:04.918]  And more and more, if I go to the Kite Festival, they have the National Guard out with police searching everyone, when if I was a bomber, I'd just bomb the checkpoint.
[02:10:05.198 --> 02:10:18.307]  I mean, it does nothing but, I guess, set the precedent that we're all prisoners and defense contractors are selling, you know, $2 million robots to every city, and we've got surveillance drones and blimps.
[02:10:18.367 --> 02:10:21.649]  I mean, this is like something out of a Kurt Vonnegut novel.
[02:10:21.689 --> 02:10:24.972]  So, Chief, it's good to have you on with us via video Skype.
[02:10:25.732 --> 02:10:26.755]  Thank you, very good to be with you.
[02:10:26.775 --> 02:10:28.199]  Well, I need to tell you...
[02:10:43.447 --> 02:10:46.150]  Yeah, we've got a Skype problem with the police chief.
[02:10:46.511 --> 02:10:51.336]  We've had a Skype problem with the last few guests, and we're going to get him connected via phone line right now.
[02:10:51.957 --> 02:10:58.304]  But we've got a routing issue with our system, and we've established that now, that that's going on.
[02:10:59.225 --> 02:11:02.990]  So we are going to connect with him via telephone and do that.
[02:11:03.852 --> 02:11:09.154]  Or he'll be the last Skype guest we ever have again with this new precedent-setting system we have.
[02:11:09.295 --> 02:11:12.316]  The reason I'm a little frustrated on air is I know it's our system.
[02:11:12.376 --> 02:11:20.660]  It does that with every guest now, and I just was waiting for that to prove I was right to happen on air with a giant galactic-sized train wreck.
[02:11:21.200 --> 02:11:22.641]  Let's go directly to telephone, guys.
[02:11:22.661 --> 02:11:27.843]  This is going to now be the thing of trying to get it to work, and we won't have the police chief on.
[02:11:28.143 --> 02:11:29.844]  But another day we will have him on.
[02:11:30.585 --> 02:11:33.047]  Let's go to Ryan in Michigan.
[02:11:33.127 --> 02:11:34.367]  Ryan, you're on the air.
[02:11:34.728 --> 02:11:37.590]  Thank you for holding today to be on the broadcast with us, Ryan.
[02:11:38.690 --> 02:11:40.312]  No problem, sir.
[02:11:41.032 --> 02:11:45.675]  I just want to warn everybody out there about that Gardasil vaccine.
[02:11:46.656 --> 02:11:49.518]  I had got it before I went to college.
[02:11:50.038 --> 02:11:57.804]  And then once I got to college, I started getting real sick a lot, like probably two or three times a month.
[02:11:58.786 --> 02:12:01.288]  Just like stomach bugs and everything.
[02:12:02.288 --> 02:12:09.634]  Then I find out I have a cardiomyopathy and now it's going to be, it's, it's just crazy.
[02:12:10.274 --> 02:12:15.758]  So I'm in the process of seeing doctors and, uh, right now.
[02:12:15.878 --> 02:12:18.880]  So I just wanted to warn everybody out there about that.
[02:12:19.200 --> 02:12:26.125]  You know, just don't put things in your body that you don't know what it is or what the hell they put in there.
[02:12:27.086 --> 02:12:27.246]  So,
[02:12:28.387 --> 02:12:32.029]  It's caused me a lot of heartache, a lot of money, a lot of time.
[02:12:32.049 --> 02:12:37.791]  So... Yeah, they come out with guilt.
[02:12:37.831 --> 02:12:40.012]  They say, turn your guns in or you cause Sandy Hook.
[02:12:40.962 --> 02:12:43.983]  They come out and they say, support government-run healthcare, you're a racist.
[02:12:44.523 --> 02:12:45.743]  And people go, okay, I support it.
[02:12:46.244 --> 02:12:51.965]  And they've come out in the last two years and said, men need to take this, you're giving women this virus.
[02:12:52.065 --> 02:12:56.046]  And then the vaccine says it doesn't even protect you from the virus on the insert.
[02:12:56.386 --> 02:13:03.748]  And it killed people in the trial, and it's been banned all over the world.
[02:13:04.389 --> 02:13:06.949]  But it's still here because we believe.
[02:13:07.149 --> 02:13:08.770]  I mean, why did you get the Gardasil shot?
[02:13:10.337 --> 02:13:24.613]  Um because the doctor told me that it would uh protect me against uh STDs and uh I never got all three of the shots I only got two of them and then I left for college so and then it's like
[02:13:25.465 --> 02:13:27.787]  My mom works for GE Capital.
[02:13:27.807 --> 02:13:29.489]  You know, my brother was a veteran.
[02:13:29.689 --> 02:13:31.511]  I'm a typical American.
[02:13:32.111 --> 02:13:33.332]  Middle class, you know.
[02:13:33.633 --> 02:13:35.274]  Yeah, well you need to sue Gardasil.
[02:13:35.634 --> 02:13:36.775]  Thousands of others are.
[02:13:36.795 --> 02:13:39.218]  And, I mean, they knew full well what they were doing.
[02:13:39.238 --> 02:13:41.079]  They knew they couldn't put it on the market because of all the deaths.
[02:13:41.460 --> 02:13:42.881]  So they just had the government mandate it.
[02:13:43.341 --> 02:13:44.542]  And it's just terrible.
[02:13:44.582 --> 02:13:45.243]  God bless you, sir.
[02:13:45.283 --> 02:13:47.085]  And I'm sorry to hear that happen to you.
[02:13:47.105 --> 02:13:48.246]  Please warn everybody you can.
[02:13:49.311 --> 02:13:50.111]  Wow, okay.
[02:13:50.311 --> 02:14:04.714]  I've really wanted him on for a long time as he knows so much about what's going on and he is the best-selling author of Breaking Rank, a top cop's expose of the dark side of American policing and he was the police chief during the WTO conference and all of that that happened.
[02:14:04.734 --> 02:14:08.015]  He's with Copsay, LegalizedDrugs.com and also Normal.
[02:14:08.415 --> 02:14:11.595]  And again, Norm Stamper, Chief, good to have you on with us.
[02:14:11.635 --> 02:14:14.836]  What do you think of the way policing's changed overall in this country?
[02:14:16.086 --> 02:14:19.127]  I'm troubled by it, deeply troubled by it, as a matter of fact.
[02:14:19.207 --> 02:14:30.751]  I think in the wake of 9-11 and also because of the impetus or the thrust of the drug war, we have police officers becoming less and less attuned to their own neighborhoods and communities.
[02:14:30.771 --> 02:14:45.295]  And quite frankly, I think what we've seen is vastly increased militarization of American police forces, which puts civil liberties at risk, which puts community health and safety at risk as well.
[02:14:48.542 --> 02:14:50.383]  Is there any way to reverse this?
[02:14:50.423 --> 02:14:53.584]  It seems like even establishment folks are starting to get concerned.
[02:14:53.904 --> 02:14:55.685]  Or will we just be like a third world country now?
[02:14:56.185 --> 02:14:58.146]  You know, I hope there's a way to reverse it.
[02:14:58.366 --> 02:15:01.267]  I always believe that there's a way to reverse it.
[02:15:01.527 --> 02:15:06.709]  This is a function, I think, of the people deciding what kind of policing they want.
[02:15:07.229 --> 02:15:09.970]  Because that's pretty much the kind of policing they're going to get.
[02:15:10.952 --> 02:15:39.933]  And I really do believe that with the aftermath of 9-11, the Department of Defense, Homeland Security, DEA, throwing money and equipment at local law enforcement, we find even tiny rural police departments with large SWAT contingencies, or contingents I should say, and we're finding no reluctance on the part of Homeland Security to provide
[02:15:40.934 --> 02:15:47.018]  Military-grade equipment to the tiniest of departments.
[02:15:47.078 --> 02:15:53.143]  An AP reporter called me a couple weeks ago, one of my reactions to a couple of examples.
[02:15:53.163 --> 02:15:55.965]  One in Georgia, the other in Texas.
[02:15:56.785 --> 02:16:01.689]  And one was a three-person police department, the other was a one-person police department.
[02:16:02.173 --> 02:16:06.575]  Meaning that one person was supposed to be the cop, the detective, and the police chief.
[02:16:07.375 --> 02:16:17.978]  And in the former case, $4 million in recent years granted to that Georgia department, $3 million to the tiny Texas department.
[02:16:17.998 --> 02:16:19.459]  There's something wrong with that picture.
[02:16:21.288 --> 02:16:22.409]  Well, there certainly is.
[02:16:22.429 --> 02:16:28.956]  I want to get into the whole situation with decriminalization and why you support that, Chief.
[02:16:29.957 --> 02:16:32.880]  But first off, obviously, I've got to bring this up.
[02:16:32.960 --> 02:16:35.242]  What happened at the WTO?
[02:16:35.302 --> 02:16:37.764]  Was that taken away from you by the Delta Force?
[02:16:38.405 --> 02:16:40.348]  And obviously there were provocateurs in the crowd.
[02:16:40.368 --> 02:16:43.231]  A lot of police complained that they weren't allowed to go after them.
[02:16:43.592 --> 02:16:47.917]  Some of them got housed at that building after, but then the peaceful protesters got attacked.
[02:16:48.257 --> 02:16:49.118]  What happened there?
[02:16:49.178 --> 02:16:51.902]  What was going on now in hindsight with that, sir?
[02:16:52.442 --> 02:16:56.648]  Well, the long and the short of it is that we thought we were prepared and we weren't.
[02:16:57.788 --> 02:17:08.633]  We thought we were ready, we thought we were smarter than the anarchists, and it turns out, at least in terms of the tactics employed, we simply were not up to it.
[02:17:09.413 --> 02:17:20.358]  It's a small city, comparatively speaking, about 530,000 at that time, with a small police force in a small state, a small county for that matter.
[02:17:21.159 --> 02:17:29.682]  And the mayor disagreed with me, but I don't think that that conference, the World Trade Organization, should have been held in Seattle at all.
[02:17:30.262 --> 02:17:31.383]  But that's another issue.
[02:17:31.403 --> 02:17:33.704]  That's a much larger political issue.
[02:17:34.284 --> 02:17:36.785]  But I will tell you that
[02:17:38.445 --> 02:17:47.047]  Looking back on it, I made the biggest mistake of my career during that week, and it now constitutes my legacy in the minds of many people.
[02:17:48.747 --> 02:18:07.892]  We were accused on day one of underreacting, on day two of overreacting, and I think the point is that if you've got a very small police force, you've got to make sure that these kinds of events
[02:18:09.018 --> 02:18:21.087]  Anything that's got world, international, trade, finance, monetary in its title should be held in much larger areas with much larger police forces.
[02:18:21.387 --> 02:18:21.828]  Sure, sure.
[02:18:21.868 --> 02:18:25.270]  Let me tell you a brief story and then I can play a clip and then move on to why you're really here today.
[02:18:25.710 --> 02:18:31.775]  My reporter, Rob Dew, won a lawsuit, I'm not gonna, we can't get into details about it, with Pittsburgh.
[02:18:32.796 --> 02:18:34.097]  He wasn't part of the protest.
[02:18:34.137 --> 02:18:35.138]  I sent a three-man team.
[02:18:35.439 --> 02:18:36.219]  He's on a hill.
[02:18:36.339 --> 02:18:37.340]  The conference is over.
[02:18:37.761 --> 02:18:39.162]  There's college kids out in the park.
[02:18:39.222 --> 02:18:40.003]  The police come.
[02:18:40.463 --> 02:18:42.125]  Multi-jurisdictions all over the country.
[02:18:42.685 --> 02:18:43.726]  Attack everybody.
[02:18:44.267 --> 02:18:48.871]  Under command of the security of the WTO or the G20 in that case.
[02:18:49.612 --> 02:18:50.372]  They were running it.
[02:18:51.499 --> 02:18:53.541]  He's up on a hill with mainstream media filming it.
[02:18:53.982 --> 02:18:56.145]  They come, they check mainstream media, they go, you're free to go.
[02:18:56.165 --> 02:19:00.950]  They arrest him and then brutalize him and don't even care it's on tape.
[02:19:01.671 --> 02:19:02.933]  And then he wins a lawsuit.
[02:19:04.154 --> 02:19:06.256]  What type of, where does that come from?
[02:19:06.317 --> 02:19:11.262]  We have video of girls on bikes at the university, not even part of anything.
[02:19:11.883 --> 02:19:18.990]  Being hit and knocked off their bike and then the cop hits her in the head, assault with a deadly weapon for no reason.
[02:19:19.330 --> 02:19:25.736]  What is going on when we see these images of what's happening to the culture?
[02:19:26.657 --> 02:19:36.566]  I think what's happening is that the police, in becoming increasingly militarized over the years, have seen the people as their enemy.
[02:19:38.179 --> 02:19:46.961]  Have, in fact, in the name of public safety, violated civil liberties and constitutional rights of their fellow Americans.
[02:19:47.541 --> 02:19:51.302]  In short, they have abused the people they've been hired to protect and serve.
[02:19:52.222 --> 02:20:00.924]  This is certainly not all cops, it's not all police departments at all times, but it's been a very disturbing trend and it needs to get reversed.
[02:20:03.171 --> 02:20:11.942]  I want to play you a clip from Seattle and then get your final points on that and then shift gears in the drug war, which obviously this all, in my view, the militarization began with.
[02:20:11.982 --> 02:20:13.524]  We'll see if you agree with that in a moment.
[02:20:13.544 --> 02:20:21.054]  But here is a clip from my film, Police State 2, the takeover from Seattle, just to remind people of what happened.
[02:20:21.094 --> 02:20:21.395]  Here it is.
[02:20:24.083 --> 02:20:31.605]  Not only could you not say what's on your mind, you couldn't wear it.
[02:20:31.645 --> 02:20:33.806]  This man had an anti-WTO sticker on his backpack.
[02:20:51.232 --> 02:20:52.953]  You saw what happened yesterday to your city.
[02:20:52.973 --> 02:20:54.494]  We're not going to let it happen again, okay?
[02:20:54.854 --> 02:20:56.195]  You're not allowed to have a sticker.
[02:20:56.235 --> 02:20:56.896]  Not here.
[02:20:57.196 --> 02:20:58.417]  It's a no-protest note, sir.
[02:20:58.717 --> 02:20:59.498]  He came loot.
[02:20:59.738 --> 02:21:01.439]  You just took his button, am I right?
[02:21:01.759 --> 02:21:02.119]  He did.
[02:21:02.179 --> 02:21:04.161]  He re-stunned his body and pulled it right out.
[02:21:04.241 --> 02:21:10.605]  I asked if I could go through, he said, I couldn't if I had a button, and I wasn't going through the line, and then he ripped it off my jacket.
[02:21:10.925 --> 02:21:14.689]  Now, if I say I'm protesting WTO, I can't go in.
[02:21:15.090 --> 02:21:18.374]  If my t-shirt said I supported the WTO, should I go in?
[02:21:18.394 --> 02:21:21.377]  That's not a protest.
[02:21:22.719 --> 02:21:27.004]  Backpacks and bags were also searched for banners or gas masks.
[02:21:32.089 --> 02:21:33.952]  How can you guys mandate something like that?
[02:21:34.012 --> 02:21:34.452]  What's that?
[02:21:34.532 --> 02:21:36.975]  I'm curious, how can you mandate something like that?
[02:21:37.055 --> 02:21:38.798]  It's a state of emergency.
[02:21:38.858 --> 02:21:40.600]  But you don't know what thoughts are in my head, right?
[02:21:40.620 --> 02:21:41.321]  I have no idea.
[02:21:41.401 --> 02:21:41.941]  Are you protesting?
[02:21:41.961 --> 02:21:42.702]  Are you protesting?
[02:21:42.722 --> 02:21:44.084]  There's no protest zone down there.
[02:21:44.104 --> 02:21:46.667]  You go down there and protest, you risk arrest.
[02:21:47.168 --> 02:21:47.428]  Okay?
[02:21:47.568 --> 02:21:48.309]  I'm just telling you that.
[02:21:48.489 --> 02:21:49.130]  You understand that?
[02:21:49.210 --> 02:21:49.530]  Understood.
[02:21:49.591 --> 02:21:49.811]  Okay.
[02:21:51.997 --> 02:21:53.499]  What country is this?
[02:21:53.519 --> 02:22:00.026]  It's a situation that is clearly uncomfortable for those who want to get through to protest and those who block their way.
[02:22:00.046 --> 02:22:04.371]  What we're trying to do is keep protesters out and the business people and citizens go in, okay?
[02:22:04.792 --> 02:22:09.077]  City leaders believe the free speech of yesterday came at too high a cost.
[02:22:09.617 --> 02:22:12.520]  That's why, at least for today, the First Amendment
[02:22:13.882 --> 02:22:17.905]  And now with Facebook, they can look and see, oh you believe this or that.
[02:22:18.025 --> 02:22:22.269]  You can't go into the city center or all this giant area.
[02:22:22.569 --> 02:22:23.370]  It's thought crime.
[02:22:23.690 --> 02:22:24.851]  That's where this is all going.
[02:22:25.191 --> 02:22:29.314]  Norm, I want to ask you, was that the federal people that told you to do that?
[02:22:30.115 --> 02:22:32.157]  And what was your liaisoning with Delta Force?
[02:22:34.233 --> 02:22:36.395]  The answer to your question, Alex, is no.
[02:22:37.296 --> 02:22:41.439]  The City of Seattle was responsible for this.
[02:22:41.779 --> 02:22:45.082]  We had spent 11 months in planning and preparation.
[02:22:45.582 --> 02:22:51.247]  We, of course, had liaisons with the Secret Service because Clinton was coming to town.
[02:22:52.172 --> 02:23:01.259]  Uh, to address the WTO, uh, as was, uh, Madeleine Albright, Secretary of State, and the, and the, and the country's chief, uh, trade negotiator.
[02:23:01.279 --> 02:23:12.567]  Uh, and, and so we, we had a lot of federal dignitaries coming to town, uh, but I will tell you that this was, was a city and state operation.
[02:23:14.120 --> 02:23:17.501]  And it was not our finest hour, to say the least.
[02:23:18.802 --> 02:23:23.043]  I only bring it up because what we see there now is the norm all over the place.
[02:23:23.143 --> 02:23:30.646]  And I just read, and I talked to some police officers off record, they said Delta Force was basically in charge.
[02:23:30.666 --> 02:23:32.847]  Were you told not to talk about Delta Force?
[02:23:33.587 --> 02:23:34.508]  Absolutely not.
[02:23:35.709 --> 02:23:46.059]  You know, I can appreciate people speculating about what went wrong, how it went wrong, who was responsible for it, but you are talking to the guy who is responsible for it.
[02:23:46.379 --> 02:23:48.681]  Sure, but I mean, so what was Delta Force doing?
[02:23:48.982 --> 02:23:55.247]  And I have not, until this moment, heard about Delta Force in conjunction with the WTO.
[02:23:57.712 --> 02:24:05.258]  That means you can either paint me as naive or as somebody who's giving you honest answers to who was responsible for what went on that week.
[02:24:05.478 --> 02:24:06.239]  Sure, sure, I understand.
[02:24:06.259 --> 02:24:08.661]  But the Feds would tell you what they wanted and then you would try to work with them?
[02:24:09.041 --> 02:24:17.148]  Well, the Feds basically said, we want to make sure that from the moment wheels are down at SeaTac, the President is safe.
[02:24:18.509 --> 02:24:25.596]  And so we obviously did everything in our power to make sure that we didn't have any kind of compromise with the press.
[02:24:25.616 --> 02:24:26.577]  Sure, sure, sure.
[02:24:26.758 --> 02:24:30.061]  Well listen, I really got Sean about the drug decriminalization.
[02:24:30.081 --> 02:24:31.503]  I just had to ask those questions.
[02:24:31.523 --> 02:24:32.804]  We really appreciate you, sir.
[02:24:32.924 --> 02:24:38.610]  Excellent questions, and it's very painful to listen to what you just played for me.
[02:24:38.630 --> 02:24:40.172]  It just, it brings it all back.
[02:24:40.819 --> 02:24:41.641]  I'm sorry to do that.
[02:24:41.681 --> 02:24:45.748]  It's good that you did it.
[02:24:45.788 --> 02:24:52.360]  It's good that we all really talk about what's happening in this country and it is, to me, very disturbing.
[02:24:52.941 --> 02:24:59.785]  So if you had it all over to do again, you don't think we should ban people for having buttons inside their bags?
[02:25:00.185 --> 02:25:04.067]  You know, that's about as un-American as anything I can imagine.
[02:25:05.027 --> 02:25:12.451]  We created what the protesters and everyone else under the sun called a no-protest zone.
[02:25:12.871 --> 02:25:19.280]  We just called it a curfew area and, you know, it is shades of Kurt Vonnegut.
[02:25:19.761 --> 02:25:21.503]  It's shades of George Orwell.
[02:25:21.563 --> 02:25:26.730]  I mean, the language that we were using, we embraced.
[02:25:26.930 --> 02:25:28.753]  We thought, well, we need a curfew.
[02:25:29.681 --> 02:25:42.708]  We need a zone in which, because of the violence that had erupted, principally the result of the anarchists, but also some of our own actions, we needed to do this.
[02:25:43.328 --> 02:25:49.732]  And on reflection, we did not need to do it, and I'll live with that mistake for the rest of my life.
[02:25:50.012 --> 02:25:57.856]  Well, wow, we really appreciate your work for trying to keep this a free country, and especially hearing it from your
[02:25:59.195 --> 02:26:01.536]  Well-experienced, educated perspective.
[02:26:01.556 --> 02:26:05.479]  Again, we have the former police chief of Seattle joining us right now.
[02:26:05.759 --> 02:26:07.080]  We're also going to talk about his book.
[02:26:07.740 --> 02:26:11.102]  Norm, let's get into, though, the drug war.
[02:26:11.202 --> 02:26:14.684]  I mean, more drugs than ever, more police state than ever.
[02:26:14.724 --> 02:26:15.805]  What do we do about the drug war?
[02:26:16.485 --> 02:26:17.185]  Well, we ended it.
[02:26:17.386 --> 02:26:18.526]  We ended it yesterday.
[02:26:18.606 --> 02:26:19.907]  We never should have started it.
[02:26:20.787 --> 02:26:23.309]  It was destined to fail.
[02:26:24.069 --> 02:26:28.412]  And it has, in fact, over the past 40 years, been a colossal failure.
[02:26:29.022 --> 02:26:32.504]  It has been an obscenely expensive war.
[02:26:32.524 --> 02:26:41.470]  1.3 trillion dollars spent since Richard Nixon famously declared drugs public enemy number one and declared all out war on them.
[02:26:42.136 --> 02:26:43.598]  What do we have to show for it?
[02:26:43.758 --> 02:27:01.938]  Well, in addition to the literally tens of millions of Americans who have been incarcerated for non-violent drug offenses over the last 40 years, drugs are more readily available today at lower prices and higher levels of potency than when Nixon declared this war.
[02:27:03.099 --> 02:27:05.761]  Every president since him has signed on to the war.
[02:27:05.982 --> 02:27:12.869]  Every one of them has, you know, statements of the present administration notwithstanding.
[02:27:13.049 --> 02:27:19.675]  Every one of them has just as vigorously as the previous president prosecuted this war.
[02:27:19.695 --> 02:27:23.159]  And it has been terribly damaged.
[02:27:24.048 --> 02:27:24.669]  We're good to go.
[02:27:44.920 --> 02:27:50.442]  It is time for us to acknowledge the huge mistake we made and end it.
[02:27:50.623 --> 02:27:54.444]  Replace prohibition, which is a corrupt and bankrupt model.
[02:27:54.484 --> 02:27:56.645]  It can never work, never has, never will.
[02:27:57.265 --> 02:28:00.447]  Replace that prohibition with a regulatory model.
[02:28:01.927 --> 02:28:11.211]  You know, a wide variety of ways to approach regulation, but something akin to what we did with alcohol seems to me to make the most sense.
[02:28:11.565 --> 02:28:12.125]  Absolutely.
[02:28:12.165 --> 02:28:16.627]  I mean, alcohol kills far more people than even the scourge of drug abuse.
[02:28:17.067 --> 02:28:21.349]  And these people really are victims that have a disease.
[02:28:21.689 --> 02:28:23.230]  Why are we throwing them in jail?
[02:28:23.650 --> 02:28:25.811]  Or just casual users of marijuana.
[02:28:26.311 --> 02:28:28.572]  Obama promised he was going to leave everybody alone.
[02:28:29.092 --> 02:28:33.414]  From what I've read, he's done triple the rage on the dispensaries that Bush did.
[02:28:33.834 --> 02:28:35.335]  But I guess he has left cover.
[02:28:35.395 --> 02:28:36.235]  I think it's disgusting.
[02:28:37.176 --> 02:28:38.696]  I think it's disgusting, too.
[02:28:39.196 --> 02:28:40.477]  You're probably aware that
[02:28:41.401 --> 02:28:48.509]  My successor in Seattle was Gil Kerlikowske, who is now the Obama administration's drug czar.
[02:28:49.410 --> 02:28:56.498]  And that's two ex-chiefs out of Seattle who could not be further apart on their views about the drug war.
[02:28:57.056 --> 02:28:57.576]  You know what's funny?
[02:28:57.616 --> 02:28:59.978]  I read about how they keep non-violent people longer than violent.
[02:29:00.298 --> 02:29:02.219]  I guess non-violent do make good prisoners.
[02:29:02.259 --> 02:29:03.419]  The private prisons make money.
[02:29:04.560 --> 02:29:08.242]  I see where these private prisons are getting laws passed to guarantee occupancy.
[02:29:08.702 --> 02:29:10.283]  This is a really dangerous scenario.
[02:29:10.843 --> 02:29:12.104]  I think it's unconscionable.
[02:29:12.184 --> 02:29:16.846]  I think it's immoral and arguably unconstitutional and illegal.
[02:29:17.367 --> 02:29:23.930]  If you think about it, every time a private corporation builds a prison, builds a cell, they need to fill that cell.
[02:29:24.130 --> 02:29:26.530]  You know, Norm, I know you only had 20 minutes with us.
[02:29:26.770 --> 02:29:29.351]  Can you do 5, 10 more to finish your point on the side of the break?
[02:29:29.711 --> 02:29:29.951]  Sure.
[02:29:30.251 --> 02:29:32.091]  Because we got you a little bit late on a technical problem.
[02:29:32.471 --> 02:29:33.132]  Thank you so much.
[02:29:33.152 --> 02:29:35.852]  We'll see if we can get him back up on Skype as well.
[02:29:36.492 --> 02:29:37.572]  Norm Stamper on with us.
[02:29:37.892 --> 02:29:42.673]  I couldn't agree with this guy more on the whole police state and drug prohibition.
[02:29:42.693 --> 02:29:44.974]  We'll be right back to get his comments on that and then your phone calls.
[02:29:50.114 --> 02:29:51.015]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.495 --> 02:29:53.015]  The Empire's on the run.

[02:33:11.619 --> 02:33:17.943]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:26.148 --> 02:33:29.750]  The drug war has been a great success for the defense contractors.
[02:33:31.371 --> 02:33:34.193]  It's been a great success for the federal government expanding its power.
[02:33:35.652 --> 02:33:40.194]  It's been a great success for bureaucracy, but it has been an absolute nightmare for this country.
[02:33:40.855 --> 02:33:44.016]  We consume more drugs than any other nation on earth.
[02:33:44.036 --> 02:33:47.979]  If you look at the statistics, it is just dumbfounding.
[02:33:48.799 --> 02:33:51.500]  And if you look at free market, it's because we have drugs illegal.
[02:33:52.301 --> 02:33:53.982]  I'm going to go back to the former police chief.
[02:33:55.208 --> 02:33:55.748]  I don't know.
[02:34:10.300 --> 02:34:15.344]  And so then that created a huge black market and the British first few decades took over the port towns.
[02:34:15.784 --> 02:34:17.666]  Bought off the police because there's incredible money.
[02:34:18.106 --> 02:34:19.327]  Bought off the local stabularies.
[02:34:19.747 --> 02:34:35.479]  Within less than a hundred years they had the whole country broke it in 10 and then 12 parts and the different Western powers ran China for hundreds of years and ran it into the ground and is the big reason it's the mess it is today in many respects.
[02:34:35.539 --> 02:34:36.240]  I've studied the history.
[02:34:36.740 --> 02:34:37.701]  Fascinating history.
[02:34:39.151 --> 02:34:45.517]  And Nixon and the rest of the black ops commanders knew full well what the drug war was going to do.
[02:34:45.798 --> 02:34:46.538]  That's my piece.
[02:34:46.939 --> 02:34:49.201]  In the seven, eight minutes we've got left with Norm Stamper.
[02:34:49.581 --> 02:34:50.622]  Norm, you've got the floor.
[02:34:50.662 --> 02:35:03.895]  I'm going to try to shut up here and let you get into why you, as a former police chief, that has witnessed this, and the statistics, the numbers, the presence, what's really behind this drug war, what do we do about it, finish your point about the presence.
[02:35:04.605 --> 02:35:08.228]  Well, you know, in a word, fear is behind the drug war.
[02:35:08.609 --> 02:35:17.277]  And I speak specifically of the fear of elected officials, of our politicians, to really confront this issue the way it deserves to be confronted.
[02:35:19.178 --> 02:35:21.741]  Politicians don't want to be seen as weak on crime.
[02:35:21.761 --> 02:35:24.003]  They don't want to be seen as weak on drugs.
[02:35:24.443 --> 02:35:27.106]  They certainly don't want to be seen as condoning drug use.
[02:35:27.666 --> 02:35:40.690]  None of us in Law Enforcement Against Prohibition, I want to get that plug in, is of the opinion that anyone should be taking any particular kinds of drugs, including alcohol and tobacco and the like.
[02:35:41.171 --> 02:35:48.133]  But we all know that people are in fact going to use drugs of a wide variety of forms.
[02:35:48.706 --> 02:35:59.806]  So the question that we face, I think, as a society is do we want these private prisons, for example, just to cite one segment of the population invested in continuing the drug war?
[02:36:01.474 --> 02:36:23.112]  To build these prisons, to fill these cells, and to, in the process, make enormous profits housing non-violent offenders who are far better off treated in those instances where they've got an addiction problem, for that addiction, and allowed to stay in their homes, in their neighborhoods, in their communities.
[02:36:23.992 --> 02:36:27.134]  We talk about the breakup of the nuclear family.
[02:36:27.174 --> 02:36:30.777]  We've done this for decades in the African-American community.
[02:36:30.857 --> 02:36:36.961]  Well, for God's sakes, it's a drug war that has produced the lion's share of that particular problem.
[02:36:37.401 --> 02:36:48.008]  So we have a public policy that doesn't work, and we have people who have a responsibility for dealing with that who are just altogether too timid to do the right thing.
[02:36:50.063 --> 02:36:56.451]  Getting back to Obama's role, I mean, he didn't keep any of his promises, but that was one thing five, six years ago.
[02:36:56.471 --> 02:37:00.956]  I thought, well, at least there's no way he's going to lie about decriminalizing marijuana.
[02:37:02.478 --> 02:37:03.519]  He must be telling the truth.
[02:37:03.580 --> 02:37:04.601]  That's a good thing.
[02:37:05.402 --> 02:37:09.086]  And he's been, as the New York Times reported, tripled
[02:37:10.120 --> 02:37:10.581]  Well, you know,
[02:37:31.481 --> 02:37:42.356]  I come back to this notion that politicians can tie themselves up and not can become paralyzed by unfounded fears.
[02:37:42.556 --> 02:37:45.500]  Their constituents are way out ahead of them.
[02:37:46.881 --> 02:37:54.385]  The polling shows that the vast majority of the American people have concluded that the drug war has been a failure.
[02:37:54.785 --> 02:37:59.907]  The majority of the American people believe that marijuana should be legalized today.
[02:38:00.547 --> 02:38:08.911]  Two states, Washington and Colorado, have in fact legalized adult use of small quantities of marijuana.
[02:38:09.691 --> 02:38:17.637]  You can't push it to a kid, you can't drive under its influence, you can't rob a bank and try to excuse yourself because you're under its influence.
[02:38:18.078 --> 02:38:31.188]  You've still got to behave responsibly, but making a choice about what you elect to put into your own body that harms no one else really should be reserved for the individual and not the government.
[02:38:32.844 --> 02:38:40.950]  What about the state's rights issue with Washington and Colorado being raided by the feds on a weekly basis when the states have decriminalized the marijuana?
[02:38:41.470 --> 02:38:44.252]  You know, we've gone beyond decriminalization.
[02:38:44.312 --> 02:38:46.894]  We have legalized Colorado and Washington.
[02:38:46.914 --> 02:38:47.715]  That's right, yeah.
[02:38:47.815 --> 02:38:54.440]  We have legalized, but the federal government trumps state law on marijuana.
[02:38:55.400 --> 02:39:01.341]  Years ago, Congress classified it as a Schedule I drug, which is an absurdity.
[02:39:02.162 --> 02:39:08.223]  But in so doing, they basically gave the federal government jurisdiction over marijuana enforcement.
[02:39:09.003 --> 02:39:21.466]  Now, so far, we have not seen the federal government move into either of these states to, you know, to do what they theoretically legally could do, and that is upend our laws altogether.
[02:39:23.231 --> 02:39:26.534]  They'd be making a huge political and strategic mistake.
[02:39:27.775 --> 02:39:44.508]  But in the end, I think we need to send a message to Congress that marijuana needs to be rescheduled and the states, apropos of your comments, the states need to be given the freedom to make their own laws along these lines.
[02:39:44.688 --> 02:39:49.095]  Sure, why do we even have states if they can't do things like decriminalize or legalize marijuana?
[02:39:49.535 --> 02:39:56.105]  And I understand they call it legalization, but there's still regulations, there's still laws, there's taxes, there's control.
[02:39:56.505 --> 02:39:58.128]  I just call that decriminalization.
[02:39:58.168 --> 02:39:59.550]  You can call it legalization, but...
[02:39:59.750 --> 02:40:10.578]  Well, and in fact, Alex, the distinction is important because, you see, if you don't legalize it, if you merely decriminalize it, it makes it an infraction.
[02:40:10.618 --> 02:40:18.643]  You're not going to go to jail behind a marijuana charge, a simple possession charge, but you are still considered a violator.
[02:40:19.024 --> 02:40:22.286]  So the product itself continues to be illicit.
[02:40:22.806 --> 02:40:28.811]  And as long as it's illicit, obscene profits will be made as a result of that classification.
[02:40:29.611 --> 02:40:30.112]  Exactly.
[02:40:30.172 --> 02:40:32.333]  I mean, look at what the drug war's done to Mexico.
[02:40:32.473 --> 02:40:33.935]  It's a completely failed state.
[02:40:34.155 --> 02:40:35.756]  Can you give us your expert opinion on that?
[02:40:36.297 --> 02:40:37.117]  I certainly can.
[02:40:37.598 --> 02:40:39.900]  I grew up in San Diego, a border town.
[02:40:39.980 --> 02:40:47.426]  I spent a lot of my earlier years in Mexico, and it's just heartbreaking what has happened in that country.
[02:40:47.506 --> 02:40:51.389]  The levels of violence, upwards of 70,000 homicides since 2006.
[02:40:51.689 --> 02:40:51.929]  Wow.
[02:40:51.989 --> 02:40:53.491]  All attributable to U.S.
[02:40:53.571 --> 02:40:53.831]  demand.
[02:40:57.973 --> 02:41:06.999]  A big portion of those deaths and of the profits of the cartels is traceable to marijuana trafficking.
[02:41:07.459 --> 02:41:10.381]  Yeah, when I was a child, we went to Mexico like three times a year.
[02:41:10.401 --> 02:41:11.562]  It's just a jewel.
[02:41:11.982 --> 02:41:18.546]  And we'd go into the mountains in the north, we'd go down to Chichen Itza in the south, Yucatan, all over.
[02:41:18.586 --> 02:41:20.207]  We didn't go to Mexico City, it was bad then.
[02:41:20.527 --> 02:41:26.331]  But now, you can't go anywhere in Mexico now, even the controlled areas where it hasn't
[02:41:26.411 --> 02:41:27.774]  Collapse to a certain extent.
[02:41:28.135 --> 02:41:28.837]  Very sad.
[02:41:28.857 --> 02:41:34.189]  It's tragic and we are the proximate cause.
[02:41:35.594 --> 02:41:41.679]  I want to get a little bit into your book and any other points you think are important to make, and I hope we can have you back again, because I think this is just an amazing interview.
[02:41:41.799 --> 02:41:47.123]  I hope that everybody will get involved and go to copssaylegalizedrugs.com, but I wanted to raise this point to you.
[02:41:47.963 --> 02:41:55.909]  I'm seeing the sanity movement really gain ground with libertarians, conservatives, you know, of course liberals, but really grow.
[02:41:56.390 --> 02:42:00.833]  Where even ten years ago, most of the police I talked to in Texas were like, you can't legalize that.
[02:42:01.233 --> 02:42:02.974]  Now all the cops I talk to
[02:42:04.015 --> 02:42:06.198]  No, that this is a total failure.
[02:42:06.398 --> 02:42:08.060]  No, it's destroying the society.
[02:42:08.460 --> 02:42:10.542]  No, it's been an excuse to militarize police.
[02:42:11.363 --> 02:42:18.892]  And I mean, I know very few police that aren't corrupt and aren't making money off of it, and who aren't part of the narcotics teams.
[02:42:19.912 --> 02:42:22.914]  Who aren't for decriminalization or legalization.
[02:42:23.535 --> 02:42:25.296]  And as you said, the polls show that.
[02:42:25.516 --> 02:42:26.276]  So here's my question.
[02:42:26.597 --> 02:42:40.505]  What's going to happen if they keep fighting this for another decade, where every cop on the force at one time or another has smoked marijuana, or everybody knows it's nothing compared to alcohol, and I'm not a pot guy, I mean, I like alcohol more and I think it's actually pretty destructive.
[02:42:41.246 --> 02:42:46.129]  I mean, what's going to happen in this hypocrisy where we all know
[02:42:46.849 --> 02:42:51.174]  That it's just a way to have the government run our lives, and for corrupt drug dealers to make money.
[02:42:51.194 --> 02:42:54.478]  I mean, how long can this fraud go on, Police Chief?
[02:42:54.999 --> 02:43:01.386]  Well, you know, we could... I guess getting into another vice, we could take bets on how long it's gonna go on.
[02:43:02.848 --> 02:43:08.531]  My theory is hypocrisy crashes of its own weight eventually.
[02:43:08.951 --> 02:43:18.936]  The way to speed up that eventuality is for people to become organized, mobilized, agitated, educated, and to make their views known.
[02:43:19.357 --> 02:43:31.463]  One of the most encouraging trends that I'm, maybe it's wishful thinking, but I am detecting, is liberals, conservatives, libertarians coming together to appreciate
[02:43:32.183 --> 02:43:39.976]  That there is nothing socially worthy of a continuation of our drug war.
[02:43:40.116 --> 02:43:45.424]  That it's done altogether too much damage and it's time for us to unite to end that war.
[02:43:46.974 --> 02:43:47.675]  Absolutely.
[02:43:47.695 --> 02:43:54.981]  If you had to take bets on it, I think it's going to be, I think in the next five to seven years, I think it'll totally collapse.
[02:43:55.041 --> 02:44:00.725]  But then, what are the big banks going to do that are busy laundering the proceeds across the board?
[02:44:01.466 --> 02:44:07.611]  Well, you've got money laundering, you've got the private prisons, you've got the drug enforcement industry.
[02:44:07.711 --> 02:44:15.818]  These are all influences and forces in our society and the structure of our economy who are tied to these profits.
[02:44:16.358 --> 02:44:18.159]  They're going to have to use their imagination.
[02:44:18.199 --> 02:44:26.923]  They're going to have to buck up and recognize the value that will come from ending the drug war.
[02:44:27.363 --> 02:44:35.267]  And I personally believe that is going to happen, whether they're forced to come to that conclusion or they simply
[02:44:36.347 --> 02:44:41.032]  Muster the spine and the honesty to say, I've known for a long time that this is foolish.
[02:44:41.612 --> 02:44:42.273]  Absolutely.
[02:44:42.834 --> 02:44:43.935]  A few minutes then we'll let you go.
[02:44:43.955 --> 02:44:44.796]  I know you're a busy man.
[02:44:45.196 --> 02:44:49.820]  Former Seattle Police Chief Norm Stamper, one of the most famous police chiefs really in America.
[02:44:49.861 --> 02:44:51.462]  You can't normally know the names of any of the others.
[02:44:51.482 --> 02:44:52.904]  You know, Daryl Gates, you know.
[02:44:53.484 --> 02:44:59.626]  Norm Stamper, you don't know really many others, and we have the Austin Police Chief on routinely, Artie Cerveda.
[02:45:00.406 --> 02:45:11.770]  But expanding on this, Norm, your book, I was mailed two or three, four years ago, whenever it came out, I was mailed a magazine that had an excerpt of it and thought, wow, and read part of it on air.
[02:45:11.850 --> 02:45:13.111]  I meant to get the book and read it.
[02:45:13.131 --> 02:45:17.872]  I don't normally put plugs out for books I haven't read, but it seems like it had a lot of really good knowledge.
[02:45:17.892 --> 02:45:19.153]  I know it sent shockwaves.
[02:45:19.733 --> 02:45:29.098]  Through law enforcement and a lot of police chiefs responded for or con, but breaking rank atop cops expose the dark side of American policing.
[02:45:29.298 --> 02:45:36.623]  Spend a few minutes plugging your book and crystallizing, crystallizing what the dark side is.
[02:45:37.663 --> 02:45:45.046]  Well, the dark side for me is all those isms that we hear about that can be reduced to arrogance or to bigotry.
[02:45:46.146 --> 02:45:51.868]  And the tendency to continue doing things that we know are failed policies.
[02:45:53.248 --> 02:45:55.590]  And that runs a pretty good gamut.
[02:45:56.390 --> 02:45:59.352]  Our approach, for example, to domestic violence.
[02:45:59.532 --> 02:46:05.296]  I personally believe that violence in the home is a precursor to pretty much all other forms of violence.
[02:46:06.517 --> 02:46:09.979]  The drug war I've mentioned, we've talked about at some length.
[02:46:10.500 --> 02:46:18.525]  I think we also need to take a look at the increased militarization, irrespective of the drug war,
[02:46:19.746 --> 02:46:23.488]  Uh, that finds its way into the policies and the procedures and the practices.
[02:46:23.568 --> 02:46:31.493]  The police response, for example, to the Occupy movement, uh, produced a number of very disturbing images.
[02:46:31.533 --> 02:46:35.316]  And I'm thinking, you have to police these, uh, events.
[02:46:35.436 --> 02:46:39.979]  You certainly have to ensure for the public safety of everyone.
[02:46:40.499 --> 02:46:48.565]  But when we, when we overreact to these situations, we essentially render ourselves, I think, un-American.
[02:46:49.925 --> 02:47:15.876]  I also believe very strongly that we need to look at other so-called victimless crimes and consensual behavior between adults that harms no one and that winds up being subject to American criminal justice laws and the criminal justice system.
[02:47:16.816 --> 02:47:26.861]  So, it's a book with 30 different chapters and 30 different topics, each one at least marginally different from the previous and the following.
[02:47:27.481 --> 02:47:28.161]  Well, I want to read it.
[02:47:28.522 --> 02:47:29.482]  And, of course, you have your own site.
[02:47:29.502 --> 02:47:30.062]  You haven't plugged.
[02:47:30.082 --> 02:47:31.283]  It's normstamper.com.
[02:47:32.020 --> 02:47:32.980]  I do, I do.
[02:47:54.687 --> 02:48:03.321]  And I appreciate your courage to say that the Seattle thing was wrong and in hindsight you don't hear that from a lot of folks but that's that's the mark of a real real humanitarian.
[02:48:03.441 --> 02:48:08.188]  Any other tidbits of police chief you'd like the former police chief of a Seattle you'd like to add for folks?
[02:48:08.786 --> 02:48:10.408]  Yeah, community policing.
[02:48:10.868 --> 02:48:26.423]  I think that there was a chance back in the 90s that we would actually see some small number of police departments embrace what I consider to be authentic community policing, and that is the community policing itself with help.
[02:48:27.163 --> 02:48:31.086]  A lot of help from the police, naturally, but other organizations as well.
[02:48:32.027 --> 02:48:39.013]  We used to say, popularly, you, the community, you need to be our eyes and ears.
[02:48:39.533 --> 02:48:53.364]  Well, I think it's time for us to turn that on its head and say, with one voice, or as many voices as we can pool together, to our local law enforcement, you are our eyes and ears.
[02:48:54.866 --> 02:49:02.271]  I was on another program yesterday with a woman who had a man who was stalking her and perhaps even some of her neighbors.
[02:49:02.752 --> 02:49:07.315]  She went around to every single one of the neighbors with a photograph of this guy and said, do you know him?
[02:49:07.755 --> 02:49:09.317]  Does he cause you discomfort?
[02:49:09.357 --> 02:49:10.297]  So on and so forth.
[02:49:11.498 --> 02:49:13.740]  And they did talk to their police, their local police.
[02:49:13.780 --> 02:49:14.981]  This happened to be in L.A.
[02:49:15.701 --> 02:49:16.622]  and they got advice.
[02:49:16.742 --> 02:49:20.204]  They got counsel from the police about what to do and what not to do.
[02:49:20.224 --> 02:49:36.934]  You know, ways to avoid a George Zimmerman, Trayvon Martin incident by the community becoming organized and mobilized and making decisions about how they want to achieve public safety in their own neighborhoods.
[02:49:36.954 --> 02:49:40.635]  Well exactly, because when you have the police militarized, it turns into an occupying army.
[02:49:41.016 --> 02:49:43.837]  They then have an attitude that they don't like you, you don't like them.
[02:49:44.197 --> 02:49:48.239]  That creates the division the authoritarian forces want in this country.
[02:49:48.259 --> 02:50:00.123]  And then I see fake community policing that just becomes secret police stuff versus police really assigned to an area where there's humanity and you know them and so everybody treats each other like humans.
[02:50:00.524 --> 02:50:02.084]  That's exactly it.
[02:50:02.184 --> 02:50:03.585]  That's my dream for policing.
[02:50:04.125 --> 02:50:06.569]  Well, that sounds almost like the old-fashioned thing.
[02:50:06.990 --> 02:50:15.102]  Yeah, sometimes, myself included, we get romantic about the old B-Cob days, but there was so much to recommend it.
[02:50:15.712 --> 02:50:22.676]  You knew the B-Cop, the B-Cop knew you, would know if there was anything suspicious in the neighborhood.
[02:50:22.696 --> 02:50:31.140]  You know, I think the community needs to take a much more active role in its own health and safety and well-being.
[02:50:31.200 --> 02:50:31.380]  Wow.
[02:50:31.821 --> 02:50:34.562]  But the police are a part of that partnership.
[02:50:34.622 --> 02:50:37.423]  And, you know, an authentic partnership is 50-50, right?
[02:50:38.624 --> 02:50:39.265]  Absolutely.
[02:50:39.365 --> 02:50:40.266]  Norm Stamper.
[02:50:40.287 --> 02:50:41.148]  He's a senior partner.
[02:50:41.188 --> 02:50:41.949]  It's the community.
[02:50:42.409 --> 02:50:43.431]  Normstamper.com.
[02:50:43.471 --> 02:50:44.632]  Norm, hope you'll come back.
[02:50:44.672 --> 02:50:45.293]  Thank you so much.
[02:50:45.654 --> 02:50:46.194]  I would love to.
[02:50:46.235 --> 02:50:46.895]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:50:46.915 --> 02:50:47.196]  All right.
[02:50:47.216 --> 02:50:47.656]  There he goes.
[02:50:47.997 --> 02:50:48.478]  All right, folks.
[02:50:48.518 --> 02:50:49.439]  Final segment coming up.

[02:50:53.905 --> 02:50:55.146]  Great job with the crew as well.

[02:52:40.469 --> 02:52:46.592]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?

[02:54:17.708 --> 02:54:19.189]  You know what I like getting guests on?
[02:54:20.991 --> 02:54:22.352]  They bring different perspectives.
[02:54:23.773 --> 02:54:28.137]  And for me, it's important to settle down because I don't get into maniac mode when I got a former police chief on.
[02:54:29.919 --> 02:54:34.983]  I mean, I do just sometimes just rant for hours on air, and I've got so much news I wanted to get to.
[02:54:35.043 --> 02:54:35.804]  I covered a lot of it.
[02:54:36.504 --> 02:54:39.187]  I may just go to a segment of the nightly news tonight to get to the rest of this.
[02:54:39.287 --> 02:54:41.148]  I just can't believe the House rejected a bid.
[02:54:42.588 --> 02:54:47.130]  And even the bill they had was just a whitewash of illegal spying.
[02:54:47.410 --> 02:54:48.590]  They won't even do that.
[02:54:49.830 --> 02:54:51.531]  And it's just going to get worse, folks!
[02:54:54.032 --> 02:54:57.013]  If you drink lard every day by the gallon, you're going to have a heart attack.
[02:54:57.793 --> 02:54:59.134]  It may take a while, but it's going to happen.
[02:54:59.394 --> 02:55:00.974]  I mean, we know where this goes.
[02:55:01.514 --> 02:55:03.795]  No checks and balances, criminals will take over.
[02:55:05.476 --> 02:55:06.976]  And it's just getting worse and worse.
[02:55:07.376 --> 02:55:09.697]  And I just want to have a future for my children.
[02:55:10.990 --> 02:55:13.732]  And I tell you, you know, I don't use illegal drugs, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:55:14.513 --> 02:55:15.774]  I don't even use prescription drugs.
[02:55:19.096 --> 02:55:22.459]  And I just, I know we've got to decriminalize.
[02:55:23.460 --> 02:55:26.021]  And it just creates this big excuse to get in our lives.
[02:55:26.682 --> 02:55:29.204]  And the government and criminal interests bring the drugs in.
[02:55:29.224 --> 02:55:30.365]  I mean, that's on record, too.
[02:55:30.385 --> 02:55:33.687]  I mean, it's just all a big joke being gamed.
[02:55:34.268 --> 02:55:35.649]  Let's go to Eric in Canada.
[02:55:35.669 --> 02:55:36.810]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:55:38.479 --> 02:55:44.205]  Hey, I heard today that Adam Kokesh's bail was paid, so he should be out soon, and hopefully you can talk to him?
[02:55:44.786 --> 02:55:50.012]  Yeah, no, I've talked to Adam a bunch of times out of jail, but they're hanging up on him.
[02:55:50.432 --> 02:55:54.557]  He calls me, and then it hangs up, and then his people call and go, well, are you hanging up?
[02:55:55.098 --> 02:55:57.760]  And then I talk to them, they three-way, then it hangs up on them.
[02:55:58.021 --> 02:55:59.603]  They're definitely hanging up on his phone calls.
[02:56:01.011 --> 02:56:04.456]  And I've had them for hours trying to interview him and do it all, but yes, we'll get him on.
[02:56:05.458 --> 02:56:08.162]  The guy, again, arrested folks for loading a shotgun in D.C.
[02:56:08.582 --> 02:56:11.507]  in defiance of the unconstitutional law that was overturned five years ago.
[02:56:11.947 --> 02:56:12.268]  D.C.
[02:56:12.308 --> 02:56:13.009]  versus Heller.
[02:56:14.792 --> 02:56:15.953]  You heard he was bailed out today?
[02:56:16.909 --> 02:56:18.651]  Yeah, Darryl Tate is down.
[02:56:18.671 --> 02:56:19.191]  He's out today.
[02:56:19.551 --> 02:56:21.994]  Also... No, let me stop you then.
[02:56:22.294 --> 02:56:23.215]  Guys, they've been calling us.
[02:56:23.255 --> 02:56:24.716]  We've tried to get him on, do his recording.
[02:56:25.177 --> 02:56:26.418]  He said he'd give us the first interview.
[02:56:26.438 --> 02:56:27.599]  Let's get him on The Nightly News tonight.
[02:56:28.099 --> 02:56:29.280]  If they want, I'll do the interview.
[02:56:29.701 --> 02:56:30.641]  Let's call all their people.
[02:56:30.661 --> 02:56:31.002]  Good job.
[02:56:31.302 --> 02:56:31.702]  Sorry, sir.
[02:56:31.722 --> 02:56:32.003]  Go ahead.
[02:56:33.075 --> 02:56:34.997]  Also, I hope you get on the JRE soon.
[02:56:35.017 --> 02:56:39.941]  I also want to know, do you think Joe Rogan is not letting everyone know that he knows more than he knows?
[02:56:39.961 --> 02:56:41.342]  Because I think he holds back.
[02:56:41.402 --> 02:56:45.445]  I think he knows a lot more and he's just playing it right so he can get on TV and get paid well.
[02:56:45.465 --> 02:56:45.645]  Yeah.
[02:56:51.698 --> 02:56:52.679]  Because every time I'm in L.A.
[02:56:52.739 --> 02:57:01.068]  I'm there for like a day and a half and I've got something else I've got to do and his podcast is huge and he kind of gets irritated when I ask him to come on and he goes, why haven't you been on my podcast?
[02:57:01.969 --> 02:57:03.390]  And I go, why don't you do Skype?
[02:57:03.410 --> 02:57:04.571]  And I think he's starting to do that.
[02:57:05.412 --> 02:57:06.633]  But I want to go out and see Joe.
[02:57:07.174 --> 02:57:10.417]  I mean, I want to go out and be on his show and I don't think Joe...
[02:57:11.550 --> 02:57:12.771]  He's holding back on anything.
[02:57:13.252 --> 02:57:14.933]  Joe used to be a lot more high-strung.
[02:57:14.973 --> 02:57:16.134]  He's a lot more laid-back now.
[02:57:16.875 --> 02:57:18.817]  And he tries to see all sides of things.
[02:57:19.478 --> 02:57:21.079]  He's more like a Zen master now.
[02:57:21.099 --> 02:57:23.642]  I've known him since, like, 1998.
[02:57:23.782 --> 02:57:27.165]  I mean, he does know a lot.
[02:57:27.505 --> 02:57:28.987]  The guy's super smart, obviously.
[02:57:30.488 --> 02:57:32.871]  I don't know what else you can say about him.
[02:57:32.891 --> 02:57:33.711]  He's a good friend of mine.
[02:57:35.433 --> 02:57:36.114]  What can I say?
[02:57:39.462 --> 02:57:41.363]  Do you have any comments on that?
[02:57:41.443 --> 02:57:45.386]  I mean, I don't think Joe's holding back.
[02:57:45.406 --> 02:57:47.988]  I don't think he would be penalized.
[02:57:48.028 --> 02:57:50.730]  I mean, Dana White lets him say and do whatever he wants.
[02:57:52.772 --> 02:57:53.632]  I don't know.
[02:57:54.033 --> 02:57:55.494]  I just think Joe's laid back.
[02:57:55.554 --> 02:58:00.377]  He takes that view that what's going to happen to humanity is going to happen.
[02:58:02.079 --> 02:58:02.779]  What else can I say?
[02:58:02.799 --> 02:58:03.520]  What do you have to say to that?
[02:58:04.691 --> 02:58:08.256]  Well, he also has a new show coming on called Joe Rogan Questions Everything, I think.
[02:58:08.316 --> 02:58:09.337]  It's on the Syfy network.
[02:58:09.678 --> 02:58:12.621]  He just went to that big conference with Ray Kurzweil.
[02:58:13.422 --> 02:58:14.304]  He likes Ray Kurzweil.
[02:58:15.427 --> 02:58:20.211]  Well, yeah, he's into life extension technology and all that stuff.
[02:58:20.471 --> 02:58:23.654]  And I mean, if Ray Kurzweil invites me to something, I'll go to it and I'll tell him I disagree with him.
[02:58:24.174 --> 02:58:27.617]  But yeah, no, I know I was offered a show on SyFy Network.
[02:58:27.637 --> 02:58:29.879]  Well, they wanted to look at doing it here every day and all this stuff.
[02:58:29.919 --> 02:58:30.780]  I just have time to mess with it.
[02:58:31.160 --> 02:58:32.821]  So I'm glad Joe's doing that as well.
[02:58:33.582 --> 02:58:35.023]  Joe's a very talented, funny guy.
[02:58:35.043 --> 02:58:37.305]  I'm going to do a little bit of overdrive, take a few of your calls.
[02:58:37.325 --> 02:58:40.087]  Stay with us, InfoWars.com, four-slash-show for the free video feed.

[02:58:55.302 --> 02:58:58.804]  At eFoods Direct, we're again celebrating Food Freedom Month.

[03:01:15.406 --> 03:01:17.747]  Let's talk to Jared in Alabama.
[03:01:17.767 --> 03:01:18.667]  Jared, you're on the air.
[03:01:18.707 --> 03:01:19.027]  Welcome.
[03:01:20.287 --> 03:01:20.928]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:01:20.968 --> 03:01:21.628]  Good to talk to you.
[03:01:21.808 --> 03:01:23.308]  Hey, bro.
[03:01:23.348 --> 03:01:29.250]  Real quick, I just wanted to, you know, well, I know you hate to hear it, but thank you for what you do, first off.
[03:01:29.490 --> 03:01:32.051]  And second off, I just want to get the word out.
[03:01:32.091 --> 03:01:33.932]  You know, I'm a first-time caller.
[03:01:33.952 --> 03:01:35.212]  I've listened to you about three years.
[03:01:36.212 --> 03:01:39.375]  Um, everybody that's listening right now can make a difference.
[03:01:39.795 --> 03:01:42.077]  I mean, you gotta take advantage of what's out there.
[03:01:42.697 --> 03:01:43.558]  Step up and do it.
[03:01:43.758 --> 03:01:45.920]  You know, small groups can make a difference.
[03:01:46.120 --> 03:01:53.626]  You can, you know, it's like the old, uh, environmentalists used to say, you know, the, uh, think globally, act locally.
[03:01:53.826 --> 03:01:55.187]  And that applies in all aspects.
[03:01:55.247 --> 03:01:55.767]  That's right.
[03:01:56.828 --> 03:01:57.949]  Exactly.
[03:01:58.049 --> 03:02:01.312]  Resist globally and resist locally.
[03:02:01.532 --> 03:02:05.155]  Because resisting locally is defeating the globalists globally.
[03:02:06.178 --> 03:02:07.958]  And we've done a good job of it in Alabama.
[03:02:08.018 --> 03:02:10.459]  You may have heard that we've strengthened gun laws.
[03:02:10.979 --> 03:02:11.499]  That's right.
[03:02:11.539 --> 03:02:12.999]  We've expanded gun laws.
[03:02:13.199 --> 03:02:15.500]  And you've passed laws against carbon taxes.
[03:02:15.900 --> 03:02:17.740]  You've passed laws against Agenda 21.
[03:02:18.541 --> 03:02:20.721]  It's absolutely freaking the kleptocrats out.
[03:02:21.601 --> 03:02:23.462]  And you've got to take advantage of it now.
[03:02:23.502 --> 03:02:26.002]  I've started a Facebook page.
[03:02:26.022 --> 03:02:29.223]  I know I said it was Second Amendment and I don't care to plug it because I'm doing fine.
[03:02:29.283 --> 03:02:32.324]  But my message is everybody can do it.
[03:02:33.464 --> 03:02:34.444]  There's power in numbers.
[03:02:35.333 --> 03:02:38.514]  And that's the key of what I wanted to say today.
[03:02:39.795 --> 03:02:43.576]  You know, that's pretty much it for me.
[03:02:44.377 --> 03:02:45.197]  God bless you, sir.
[03:02:45.237 --> 03:02:45.757]  Keep it up.
[03:02:45.817 --> 03:02:46.938]  Yeah.
[03:02:47.218 --> 03:02:52.780]  Hollywood imprints this image from birth that one strong man defeats the entire enemy.
[03:02:53.821 --> 03:02:56.262]  There's targets of opportunity to wake people up everywhere.
[03:02:57.862 --> 03:03:01.364]  Defeating the globalists isn't just about fighting them, it's about empowering good people.
[03:03:02.355 --> 03:03:05.296]  And most people that are fighting for the New World Order don't even know it.
[03:03:07.216 --> 03:03:09.917]  Let's go ahead and talk to Cory in Mass.
[03:03:09.937 --> 03:03:10.977]  Thanks for holding, you're on the air.
[03:03:11.998 --> 03:03:12.738]  How you doing, Alex?
[03:03:13.058 --> 03:03:13.458]  Good, brother.
[03:03:13.498 --> 03:03:13.998]  Thanks for holding.
[03:03:15.679 --> 03:03:18.639]  Well, I'm a local truck driver based out of Pennsylvania.
[03:03:18.659 --> 03:03:20.180]  I'm actually up here in Massachusetts today.
[03:03:20.560 --> 03:03:27.122]  But the reason I call up is I have a local customer that I deliver to in Long Island, outside of the U.S.
[03:03:27.162 --> 03:03:28.082]  National Cemetery.
[03:03:29.680 --> 03:03:37.064]  Um, on the northwest side of the cemetery, there are, um, a bunch of those plastic coffins you did a story about a couple years ago?
[03:03:37.084 --> 03:03:38.464]  You remember what I'm talking about?
[03:03:39.045 --> 03:03:39.345]  Yes.
[03:03:40.565 --> 03:03:41.966]  Uh, they had caught my attention.
[03:03:42.006 --> 03:03:43.367]  I've never seen them in person.
[03:03:44.067 --> 03:03:50.750]  And I would, I used, I would be what you used to, or what you would consider a skeptic of things, which is good by nature.
[03:03:50.830 --> 03:03:53.531]  We want to investigate things and believe things with our own eyes.
[03:03:53.571 --> 03:03:54.652]  Well, after I saw that,
[03:03:56.405 --> 03:04:00.007]  I put two and two together, and now I'm starting to really see the big picture.
[03:04:00.047 --> 03:04:01.348]  What is the name of the cemetery?
[03:04:01.388 --> 03:04:02.329]  We'll go to Google Earth.
[03:04:03.329 --> 03:04:06.331]  It's, um, Long Island National Cemetery.
[03:04:08.092 --> 03:04:12.234]  It is, um, off Pine Lawn Road, in Long Island there.
[03:04:13.155 --> 03:04:16.097]  Good landmark to use is the 495, the Long Island Expressway.
[03:04:16.137 --> 03:04:21.280]  Well, some of those are real coffin liners, but they admit they can also be used during emergencies.
[03:04:21.940 --> 03:04:22.861]  But there are real
[03:04:24.085 --> 03:04:30.169]  Mass casualty plans with the different state cemetery boards all over the country for millions of dead.
[03:04:30.229 --> 03:04:32.891]  We've confirmed that with the documents.
[03:04:33.091 --> 03:04:39.815]  And those coffins are part of that, but they're also dual-use for just regular burial liners.
[03:04:40.476 --> 03:04:44.138]  So then they can strawman and say we're making it up.
[03:04:44.218 --> 03:04:47.540]  But did you get any photos of that?
[03:04:48.341 --> 03:04:49.762]  Yeah, actually I did take a picture.
[03:04:50.342 --> 03:04:52.424]  Can you send it to showtipsatinfowars.com?
[03:04:53.519 --> 03:04:55.040]  Show tips at Infowars.com.
[03:04:55.080 --> 03:04:56.261]  Yeah, I'll do that right now.
[03:04:56.821 --> 03:04:57.702]  Anything else, sir?
[03:04:58.622 --> 03:04:59.343]  No, that was it.
[03:04:59.363 --> 03:05:02.205]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:02.445 --> 03:05:12.912]  Myself, my family, the Infowars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[03:05:13.112 --> 03:05:17.215]  Infowars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.
[03:05:17.555 --> 03:05:19.997]  But we can't do that without your help.
[03:05:20.318 --> 03:05:31.148]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at InfoWars.com, you will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[03:05:31.588 --> 03:05:34.731]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[03:05:35.051 --> 03:05:40.694]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[03:05:41.174 --> 03:05:47.977]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization.
