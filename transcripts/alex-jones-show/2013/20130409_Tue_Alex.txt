[00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.126]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:00:05.467 --> 00:00:07.152]  Great Talk Radio starts here.
[00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:19.113]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:19.774 --> 00:00:20.574]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.355 --> 00:00:22.276]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.917 --> 00:00:26.540]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.101 --> 00:00:31.165]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:53.445]  Regular listeners will note, but new listeners can simply go into the archives of our podcast up at InfoWars.com or go to YouTube or PrisonPlanet.tv that I've been telling you in the last few years that things are just going to accelerate.
[00:00:53.465 --> 00:01:03.728]  They're going to get crazier and crazier with technological development, with economic crises, but also with amazing opportunities for liberty.
[00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.411]  And that we're going to see wars and rumors of wars.
[00:01:09.171 --> 00:01:12.332]  And now think about the amount of crazy news a day.
[00:01:12.492 --> 00:01:16.213]  It's more than we would see in a year a decade ago.
[00:01:17.654 --> 00:01:32.759]  And if you study history and project in with future trends, moving towards what the establishment calls the singularity, you will see more change in a week and say a decade from now than we've already seen in the last 10 years.
[00:01:34.218 --> 00:01:38.323]  And so it's all just going to get more and more insane.
[00:01:39.084 --> 00:01:43.629]  North Korea to launch missile tomorrow after warning foreigners to evacuate the South.
[00:01:45.631 --> 00:01:49.275]  Unprecedented to say we're going to attack you.
[00:01:49.295 --> 00:01:54.220]  There's going to be explosions in South Korea, Japan and the West Coast and Austin.
[00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:56.912]  He has atomic weapons.
[00:01:57.032 --> 00:02:02.099]  Our government helped give it to his father in the mid-90s with ABB and Donald Rumsfeld.
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.061]  And it's just unprecedented.
[00:02:05.984 --> 00:02:09.689]  Absolutely unprecedented, the things that are going on in our world.
[00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:18.343]  Meanwhile, up on Infowars.com, Big Sis testing drones that can detect guns in America.
[00:02:18.743 --> 00:02:22.005]  We showed some of their training videos a month ago and people said, oh, it can't be true.
[00:02:22.445 --> 00:02:31.449]  Now they officially are preparing with Homeland Security drones to fly around and detect American gun owners.
[00:02:32.483 --> 00:02:36.706]  And they've got a local Oklahoma news channel telling you, don't worry, we come in peace.
[00:02:37.327 --> 00:02:39.008]  Don't run, we are your friends.
[00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:42.971]  You know how that ends in Mars attacks or at wake up.
[00:02:43.031 --> 00:02:47.915]  Continuing, Obama demands vote on Second Amendment during Hartford speech.
[00:02:49.096 --> 00:02:53.840]  And I've got Nemo doing another article right now, Obama has been caught in a gigantic
[00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:00.902]  Humongous lie saying that 90% of people support more gun control when there is no poll showing that.
[00:03:01.322 --> 00:03:07.124]  Even the fake CBS polls and Gallup polls and public policy polls and stuff show 50% or less.
[00:03:07.204 --> 00:03:09.625]  In fact, here's some of the headlines.
[00:03:10.025 --> 00:03:12.826]  NPR, The Hill, you name it.
[00:03:14.047 --> 00:03:17.888]  Polls support for new gun control drops by double digit margins.
[00:03:19.455 --> 00:03:22.336]  Here's another one, NRA winning the influence battle over gun control.
[00:03:22.416 --> 00:03:28.839]  Forbes, with the actual data mining, it shows it's backfired on them, the opposite of actually getting people on board.
[00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:37.682]  What a spectacle, Obama using those dead kids and rolling out the parents, saying, America, it's your fault this happened.
[00:03:38.783 --> 00:03:40.003]  Restrict your guns.
[00:03:41.084 --> 00:03:47.106]  No parents, you took your children to a government training center, advertised as a mass shooting facility,
[00:03:49.232 --> 00:03:55.375]  And you're the ones, globalists and supporters of it, that are supporting all the mentally ill people on the psychotropics.
[00:03:56.296 --> 00:03:57.636]  In almost every case they're on them.
[00:03:59.157 --> 00:04:12.624]  And then you want to point at me, in my life, with no criminal record, in areas with crime rates incredibly low compared to areas where they've restricted guns, and lecture me with a bunch of guilt
[00:04:15.455 --> 00:04:18.097]  That I better get on with your agenda or I'm a bad person.
[00:04:18.117 --> 00:04:20.518]  It's like, go along with Socialist Healthcare or you're a racist.
[00:04:20.778 --> 00:04:21.719]  Well, I'm a racist then.
[00:04:22.059 --> 00:04:24.381]  You gotta call the bluff of the politically correct people.
[00:04:24.541 --> 00:04:25.962]  Because they're not really politically correct.
[00:04:25.982 --> 00:04:26.862]  They're not really liberals.
[00:04:27.182 --> 00:04:31.105]  They're cold-bloodedly using these tragedies and using these poor parents.
[00:04:32.677 --> 00:04:35.600]  So, obviously, it should be back on the government.
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.982]  Why have you made schools gun-free zones?
[00:04:38.202 --> 00:04:40.484]  Because bad guys are going to bring guns wherever they want anyways.
[00:04:40.845 --> 00:04:42.246]  Why haven't you armed the teachers?
[00:04:42.867 --> 00:04:43.407]  Why haven't you?
[00:04:43.467 --> 00:04:43.667]  No, no.
[00:04:43.707 --> 00:04:52.696]  Instead, you want all of us disarmed to make the whole country a gun-free zone so the criminal government and the mercenaries and your criminal friends can rape and pillage and rob us.
[00:04:52.716 --> 00:04:53.657]  Well, I got news for you.
[00:04:53.857 --> 00:04:55.037]  You collectivist dirtbags.
[00:04:55.378 --> 00:04:56.438]  Our kids belong to us.
[00:04:56.558 --> 00:04:57.618]  Our guns belong to us.
[00:04:57.858 --> 00:04:59.499]  We see who you are, you tyrants.
[00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:01.920]  Go ahead and stage your terror attacks and try to blame it on us.
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.000]  We know you're the terrorist scumbags.
[00:05:04.361 --> 00:05:04.701]  Okay?
[00:05:05.061 --> 00:05:05.761]  We see you.
[00:05:06.021 --> 00:05:06.901]  We know who you are.
[00:05:07.022 --> 00:05:07.842]  Criminal mafia.
[00:05:10.157 --> 00:05:12.058]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[00:05:12.098 --> 00:05:14.359]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[00:05:14.499 --> 00:05:19.741]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[00:05:19.961 --> 00:05:23.743]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[00:05:24.003 --> 00:05:27.785]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[00:05:27.945 --> 00:05:29.145]  The fact is, you are.
[00:05:29.345 --> 00:05:30.106]  We all are.
[00:05:30.346 --> 00:05:32.687]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[00:05:32.987 --> 00:05:41.355]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoods Direct.
[00:05:41.555 --> 00:05:42.776]  Be prepared before you need it.

[00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:48.681]  You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed you.
[00:05:48.801 --> 00:05:53.225]  Do what I've done and get your own supply of the best storable foods out there from eFoods Direct.

[00:06:07.679 --> 00:06:09.561]  You can bet your life on eFoodsDirect.
[00:06:10.734 --> 00:06:13.797]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms.
[00:06:14.138 --> 00:06:19.603]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[00:06:20.184 --> 00:06:23.387]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?
[00:06:24.068 --> 00:06:25.349]  Check out SimpliSafe.
[00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:29.534]  It's a new do-it-yourself home security system that is completely wireless.
[00:06:30.114 --> 00:06:32.156]  Go to GetSimpliSafe.com.
[00:06:32.817 --> 00:06:35.218]  SimpliSafe is independent and off the grid.
[00:06:35.559 --> 00:06:39.341]  It runs on battery power, so even if the grid goes down, you're protected.
[00:06:39.921 --> 00:06:46.065]  It's completely customizable, so you can use it in your home, business, boat, trailer, storage unit, or shed.
[00:06:46.565 --> 00:06:48.086]  Get SimpliSafe.com

[00:06:56.289 --> 00:06:59.870]  If you move or need to relocate, you can take the system with you wherever you go.
[00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:06.813]  You aren't always at home, but SimplySafe will stand guard, protecting your property 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
[00:07:07.373 --> 00:07:09.534]  Again, that's GetSimplySafe.com.
[00:07:10.154 --> 00:07:11.795]  Introducing Pro-1.
[00:07:12.055 --> 00:07:15.558]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[00:07:15.698 --> 00:07:20.101]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[00:07:20.221 --> 00:07:26.225]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:07:26.345 --> 00:07:37.133]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.
[00:07:37.333 --> 00:07:43.640]  It is the only one that does it, and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:58.555]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands,
[00:07:58.795 --> 00:08:01.497]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones!
[00:08:28.536 --> 00:08:32.477]  You know where you've got to go now if you want to escape the incredible tyranny of the United States?
[00:08:32.497 --> 00:08:33.517]  You've got to flee to Cuba.
[00:08:35.138 --> 00:08:46.320]  They've got surveillance footage from the dock in Tampa, Florida, where they believe Michael Haken and his wife with their two children that they kidnapped.
[00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:50.601]  Why, he's supposedly the Air Force veteran engineer, his wife an engineer.
[00:08:50.981 --> 00:08:51.861]  No criminal record.
[00:08:51.901 --> 00:08:54.022]  Got caught with a bowl of marijuana.
[00:08:54.622 --> 00:09:02.466]  In Louisiana, so they took his kids, and a year later he was tired of it, so he went and got them back, and I was just watching CNN.
[00:09:02.667 --> 00:09:03.487]  They're all breathless.
[00:09:04.187 --> 00:09:07.489]  He ran to Cuba with the kidnapped children, and they're all got real serious faces.
[00:09:07.769 --> 00:09:09.330]  There's nothing worse than a family.
[00:09:09.791 --> 00:09:12.872]  Now, if you drone strike a whole village to kill one guy, that's peace prize.
[00:09:13.353 --> 00:09:20.697]  But I'm telling you, a dad and a mother standing up to the state with their kids, I mean, there is nothing worse.
[00:09:21.517 --> 00:09:28.263]  And the reporters just all looked extremely freaked out on CNN during the break right before we went live here.
[00:09:28.303 --> 00:09:29.804]  They were, this is just terrible!
[00:09:29.844 --> 00:09:32.547]  These anti-government people are despicable!
[00:09:33.902 --> 00:09:47.450]  Why, they don't believe the state owns the children, and they don't believe we should be able to put hundreds of vaccines in them, and they don't like America being run by a foreign New World Order, and worst of all, they had an InfoWars.com bumper sticker on their house.
[00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:49.851]  It is just absolutely horrible.
[00:09:50.191 --> 00:09:54.654]  In fact, I think they have a clip of it here in a moment for TV viewers that are watching us on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:09:55.234 --> 00:10:02.879]  When it cuts to reporters, they just have this look on their face like it is just the end of the world.
[00:10:03.599 --> 00:10:06.743]  All right, moving along here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:07.765 --> 00:10:09.867]  Again, Kibbs abducted in Florida.
[00:10:10.348 --> 00:10:12.330]  Custody case taken to Cuba.
[00:10:14.378 --> 00:10:16.160]  So there you go.
[00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:25.088]  A Florida couple suspected of kidnapping their two sons from the woman's parents in Tampa have fled by boat to Cuba, according to Florida authorities, not servants.
[00:10:25.388 --> 00:10:30.593]  The boys have been living since last year with their maternal grandparents, who were granted permanent custody a week ago.
[00:10:30.934 --> 00:10:35.098]  The Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office alleges that Michael Hagen
[00:10:35.678 --> 00:10:50.324]  And it goes on from there, oh my gosh, can you imagine that they've gone to Cuba, who has no extradition, and he reportedly bought a boat, planned the whole thing, nothing more despicable than a family and a father.
[00:10:51.164 --> 00:10:53.226]  Only thing, the state is your father.
[00:10:53.806 --> 00:10:56.529]  The state, when it was Stalin or Hitler, it's your father.
[00:10:56.789 --> 00:10:58.570]  And I agree with MSNBC.
[00:10:59.231 --> 00:11:08.979]  There is no private children, they belong to the state, and we've got a FEMA Corps, and we've got clergy response teams, state-run churches, that's a great sign of a free country.
[00:11:09.339 --> 00:11:11.301]  That doesn't violate the First Amendment, of course it does.
[00:11:12.441 --> 00:11:13.522]  Just incredible.
[00:11:14.503 --> 00:11:17.344]  Just incredible to have that type of stuff going on.
[00:11:18.044 --> 00:11:30.188]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to get into Obama pimping out the dead children of Connecticut, saying, hey, do this for the families, restrict your guns.
[00:11:30.348 --> 00:11:34.909]  And this is what 90% of Americans want, a total and complete lie.
[00:11:34.929 --> 00:11:38.370]  We're going to break that down here in just a moment.
[00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:40.951]  And I was driving home last night at about 8 o'clock.
[00:11:42.148 --> 00:11:42.408]  I don't
[00:11:57.219 --> 00:12:03.046]  Newtown, Connecticut, and then flying the families back for a rally in D.C.
[00:12:03.827 --> 00:12:07.652]  But what did the pro-gun people do?
[00:12:07.812 --> 00:12:09.754]  They snubbed the parents.
[00:12:10.315 --> 00:12:13.859]  And the commentator goes, oh, come on, you didn't do that.
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:15.701]  And then they cut to Obama.
[00:12:16.241 --> 00:12:18.023]  I mean, just unbelievable.
[00:12:18.383 --> 00:12:22.026]  Foreign banks have captured the federal government, most the states.
[00:12:22.426 --> 00:12:30.813]  They're taking $85 billion a month of your taxpayer money and giving it to foreign banks and telling Congress who gets it specifically a secret.
[00:12:31.373 --> 00:12:39.480]  They are erecting all sorts of police state systems, FEMA camps, the Emergency Centers Establishment Act, the Civilian Inmate Labor Camp Program.
[00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:40.621]  These are all declassified.
[00:12:41.141 --> 00:12:42.282]  They are training.
[00:12:43.303 --> 00:12:45.024]  Fox News headline.
[00:12:45.724 --> 00:12:48.506]  Christians listed as extremists next to Al Qaeda.
[00:12:49.227 --> 00:12:49.827]  Catholics.
[00:12:50.528 --> 00:12:51.328]  Evangelicals.
[00:12:51.528 --> 00:12:52.529]  What's wrong with evangelicals?
[00:12:52.549 --> 00:12:57.833]  They've called for turning our guns in and they were in the news today saying total amnesty, total open borders.
[00:12:58.073 --> 00:12:59.054]  Well that isn't enough.
[00:12:59.454 --> 00:13:00.555]  You are a terrorist.
[00:13:01.371 --> 00:13:04.034]  I mean, this is the over-the-top stuff.
[00:13:04.895 --> 00:13:23.994]  Imagine if people had gotten a time machine from the 1950s and teleported here and turned on MSNBC, where they're saying, fathers are bad, the state runs your children, five-year-olds need to be taught how to masturbate in school, the borders need to be opened, it's your fault somebody went to a gun-free zone and killed people.
[00:13:25.535 --> 00:13:26.977]  We're bringing in world government.
[00:13:26.997 --> 00:13:29.040]  There are no drones, but we're launching drones.
[00:13:29.822 --> 00:13:31.825]  I mean, this is the type of craziness.
[00:13:31.845 --> 00:13:34.609]  We have an article up at Infowars.com right now.
[00:13:34.649 --> 00:13:35.450]  Look at these headlines.
[00:13:36.612 --> 00:13:41.098]  Big Sis testing drones that can detect guns.
[00:13:44.312 --> 00:14:01.005]  Big sis testing drones that can detect guns and this is officially Homeland Security with a training center in Oklahoma with the Department of Defense training to detect guns and it's part of the Governor's Council there in the state to launch these vehicles.
[00:14:01.505 --> 00:14:04.868]  Obama demands a vote on Second Amendment during Hartford speech.
[00:14:06.129 --> 00:14:11.173]  Police confiscate man's guns over son's water pistol.
[00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:13.330]  Threat.
[00:14:14.111 --> 00:14:20.578]  Reportedly, bullies were beating up the kids so they joked around and said we ought to get our water guns and squirt them.
[00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:24.662]  Show that dad had his guns taken because his 10-year-old allegedly said that.
[00:14:24.942 --> 00:14:26.404]  No judge, no jury, no nothing.
[00:14:26.744 --> 00:14:28.145]  The guns are locked up in a safe.
[00:14:28.346 --> 00:14:29.947]  It's up there in Long Island.
[00:14:31.055 --> 00:14:35.177]  But that wasn't enough, and the police, the father said, when do I get my guns back?
[00:14:35.197 --> 00:14:35.818]  He goes, well, your son's 10.
[00:14:36.138 --> 00:14:43.562]  When he's 18, if we come to a home inspection and prove he's moved out, but he's not allowed in your house either, then you can have your guns back.
[00:14:44.386 --> 00:14:48.408]  No judge, no jury, no warrant, no nothing, just martial law.
[00:14:48.788 --> 00:14:52.170]  And that's what knock-and-talk's been under federal grants for 15 years.
[00:14:52.591 --> 00:14:59.995]  From Dallas, Texas to Boston, Massachusetts, the police come to your house and say, knock-knock, in nice neighborhoods, by the way, because they can do it there, they can do it anywhere.
[00:15:00.215 --> 00:15:01.836]  We'd like to come in and inspect your firearms.
[00:15:02.816 --> 00:15:09.320]  And I've played newscast here in Boston, where they actually force their way in without warrants.
[00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:10.921]  Just door-to-door.
[00:15:11.977 --> 00:15:13.538]  And that's what gun buybacks are for.
[00:15:13.578 --> 00:15:16.279]  The image on the news of people handing guns in.
[00:15:16.319 --> 00:15:23.622]  It's all part of the conditioning and all the Hollywood movies where they show, oh my gosh, this guy's got a gun in his house.
[00:15:23.642 --> 00:15:27.764]  You know, the cops break into the house without a warrant because they've got to save the kids.
[00:15:28.104 --> 00:15:30.365]  They find little kids, you know, dead in the basement.
[00:15:30.645 --> 00:15:32.225]  Look at this guy, he's an NRA member.
[00:15:32.306 --> 00:15:33.706]  There's nothing worse than those scum.
[00:15:33.906 --> 00:15:35.567]  They'll show an NRA sticker on the wall.
[00:15:35.747 --> 00:15:37.568]  That's an actual TV show I covered years ago.
[00:15:38.905 --> 00:15:41.266]  And they'll go, yeah, it's just despicable.
[00:15:41.326 --> 00:15:42.586]  He's got illegal guns.
[00:15:42.906 --> 00:15:48.768]  And he'll show a shotgun, which isn't even legal, except in New York or Chicago, in the cities.
[00:15:49.408 --> 00:15:52.969]  But again, it's just put out there, guns are illegal, guns are illegal.
[00:15:53.469 --> 00:15:55.870]  It's like guns are the new N-word or something.
[00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:58.171]  This is all part of the political
[00:15:58.891 --> 00:15:59.431]  Correctness.
[00:15:59.671 --> 00:16:00.111]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:16:01.492 --> 00:16:05.453]  Washington gun bill includes police searches without warrants.
[00:16:05.653 --> 00:16:06.053]  Boom!
[00:16:06.553 --> 00:16:10.574]  Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported on that a few weeks ago.
[00:16:10.914 --> 00:16:13.275]  They're not playing games.
[00:16:13.655 --> 00:16:15.756]  They're not playing games.
[00:16:17.696 --> 00:16:20.757]  And then, of course, the big news of the day, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:20.797 --> 00:16:24.698]  North Korea to launch missile tomorrow after warning foreigners to evacuate the South.
[00:16:25.198 --> 00:16:27.259]  I want to comment on this at the bottom of the hour.
[00:16:28.328 --> 00:16:37.061]  But right now, let's start analyzing the incredible lies of Obama flying the Newtown families around.
[00:16:37.221 --> 00:16:39.945]  And on every news channel, you've heard it, you've seen it.
[00:16:40.876 --> 00:16:48.398]  If you care about the families, let's have sensible, reasonable gun registration, confiscation, and make most gun owners felons.
[00:16:48.418 --> 00:16:49.318]  I mean, that's what it really does.
[00:16:49.338 --> 00:16:52.279]  But this is something 90% of people support.
[00:16:52.619 --> 00:16:54.319]  Just give us a vote.
[00:16:55.059 --> 00:16:56.400]  Just do the right thing.
[00:16:56.440 --> 00:17:03.421]  And then Obama tears up, and the BBC headline is, it gets personal for president because he cares about the kids.
[00:17:04.061 --> 00:17:10.163]  Yeah, he signs drone death orders where they'll kill hundreds of innocent people to, quote, get one bad guy.
[00:17:11.072 --> 00:17:14.915]  Or they'll put Al-Qaeda in Libya or Syria to murder the Christians in mass.
[00:17:15.535 --> 00:17:16.115]  Our government.
[00:17:17.076 --> 00:17:19.638]  And then, but oh, he, the Newtown kids, oh!
[00:17:20.278 --> 00:17:24.101]  They take them, put them in our face, tell us their names, who they were.
[00:17:24.121 --> 00:17:32.867]  I heard an ad this morning on the radio, Bloomberg paid for it locally, going, I dropped Billy off and watched him go around the corner.
[00:17:33.621 --> 00:17:36.064]  And he never came back, all because of the guns.
[00:17:36.644 --> 00:17:39.367]  Won't you just turn your guns in for my son?
[00:17:39.848 --> 00:17:41.950]  Why'd you do it to him, gun owners?
[00:17:44.393 --> 00:17:46.515]  Listen, I didn't kill your kids.
[00:17:47.416 --> 00:17:50.680]  The federal government made the schools gun-free zones.
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:53.623]  You advertised them as the place for every crazy to go.
[00:17:53.864 --> 00:17:54.845]  And I'll tell you right now.
[00:17:55.925 --> 00:17:57.365]  It's open and shut.
[00:17:57.445 --> 00:17:59.306]  It's a government operation at the movie theater.
[00:17:59.866 --> 00:18:00.286]  No doubt.
[00:18:00.687 --> 00:18:02.047]  DARPA involved all of it.
[00:18:02.447 --> 00:18:04.348]  Guy was on seven drugs, total patsy.
[00:18:04.688 --> 00:18:07.389]  Witnesses saying he was under mind control when he came off the drugs.
[00:18:07.609 --> 00:18:10.610]  Now they've drugged him for court to make him tell the truth that he did it.
[00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:13.110]  Truth serum just makes you say what they want you to say.
[00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:21.213]  They can put me on it and roll me out and say I'm Puff the Magic Dragon that lived by the sea and frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Bumblebee.
[00:18:22.376 --> 00:18:24.717]  I mean, this is the type of stuff they're doing.
[00:18:25.057 --> 00:18:32.459]  And I'm going to tell you, New Haven, Sandy Hook, it's got Inside Job written all over it.
[00:18:33.619 --> 00:18:36.880]  You look at Harris and Kleibold and all of these events.
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:39.381]  I mean, you know, the parents are always working for DARPA.
[00:18:41.977 --> 00:18:43.620]  The kids are always on psychotropics.
[00:18:43.641 --> 00:18:47.128]  The kids are always making films for the school how they're gonna kill everybody.
[00:18:47.649 --> 00:18:52.579]  So you can arrest people or kick them out of school with bubble guns or paintballs.
[00:18:54.195 --> 00:19:02.557]  And every day I see articles where people drive by and see kids with orange and green Nerf guns out front their houses having a Nerf war, and the SWAT team's called.
[00:19:02.917 --> 00:19:08.819]  And they do it on purpose to create the image to literally brainwash the public that guns are dirty, guns are bad.
[00:19:09.379 --> 00:19:11.099]  This is pure authoritarianism.
[00:19:11.119 --> 00:19:12.620]  And by the way, it's bipartisan.
[00:19:13.362 --> 00:19:14.644]  They're moving on gutting the borders.
[00:19:15.204 --> 00:19:19.870]  They're bringing in the government-run health care and my insurance companies to bankrupt health care and double prices.
[00:19:20.531 --> 00:19:21.892]  They are bankrupting the country.
[00:19:21.912 --> 00:19:24.155]  They've got tens of millions more going on food stamps.
[00:19:24.595 --> 00:19:27.238]  Over 101 million people are out of the workforce now.
[00:19:27.639 --> 00:19:29.962]  America is imploding into a depression.
[00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:45.564]  But because of industrialization, the government's going to have enough baubles to hand out to get the dependent people on the dole to then go vote to take our guns and take our property and take our free speech and take our children.
[00:19:45.724 --> 00:19:49.808]  Just have an attention span out there if the globalists are able to take over.
[00:19:50.048 --> 00:19:56.014]  Those of you that support this and feel like you're part of the system, useful idiot fools, remember why your life falls apart.
[00:19:57.697 --> 00:20:00.918]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is part of a globalist offensive.
[00:20:01.118 --> 00:20:02.538]  They're moving on all fronts.
[00:20:02.939 --> 00:20:06.680]  That's why they've got the Catholic Church, the Protestant Church is saying, turn your guns in.
[00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:08.700]  Everything's happening now.
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:10.321]  They're moving on all fronts.
[00:20:10.461 --> 00:20:12.381]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[00:20:12.401 --> 00:20:14.322]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[00:20:14.542 --> 00:20:20.004]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[00:20:20.224 --> 00:20:23.485]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[00:20:24.225 --> 00:20:27.967]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[00:20:28.127 --> 00:20:29.307]  The fact is, you are.
[00:20:29.507 --> 00:20:30.308]  We all are.
[00:20:30.548 --> 00:20:32.869]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[00:20:33.169 --> 00:20:41.452]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoods Direct.

[00:22:12.314 --> 00:22:14.955]  Hey, that's a sweet AK-47 chest rig.
[00:22:14.995 --> 00:22:16.055]  Is that multi-cam?
[00:22:16.075 --> 00:22:16.295]  Yep!
[00:22:16.475 --> 00:22:18.596]  Got it from StrikeHardGear.com.
[00:22:18.776 --> 00:22:19.456]  Strike what?

[00:22:39.321 --> 00:22:48.587]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:22:48.647 --> 00:22:49.388]  This capitalism?
[00:22:49.448 --> 00:22:55.592]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:22:55.712 --> 00:22:56.493]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:22:56.533 --> 00:22:59.615]  I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[00:22:59.675 --> 00:23:00.575]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.

[00:23:09.901 --> 00:23:12.762]  Is this the year you finally get serious about your family's drinking water?
[00:23:13.082 --> 00:23:16.363]  If so, keep listening for a special offer from Big Berkey Water Filters.

[00:23:30.368 --> 00:23:31.368]  Then there's affordability.

[00:24:34.346 --> 00:24:46.604]  Alright, so Obama quotes some university poll, government-funded poll, that no other polls show that 90% of people support quote background checks that are really registration for confiscation.
[00:24:46.984 --> 00:24:49.007]  Criminals go out and get their guns regardless.
[00:24:49.668 --> 00:24:54.671]  Mentally ill people are just gonna steal them like Adam Lanza did if you even believe he's not a total patsy.
[00:24:55.252 --> 00:25:01.275]  And so this argument of, oh we just want sensible control, you mean a total ban like New York or Chicago?
[00:25:01.836 --> 00:25:06.519]  Unless you're inside the mafia and then you get one of those special permits that hardly anybody can get?
[00:25:07.639 --> 00:25:09.262]  This is about a monopoly of power.
[00:25:09.502 --> 00:25:11.445]  What's the first thing a criminal does when they come in a bank?
[00:25:11.745 --> 00:25:15.531]  They say, put your hands up and put any weapons you've got on the floor.
[00:25:15.852 --> 00:25:17.093]  I'm not playing around.
[00:25:17.494 --> 00:25:18.616]  I'll blow your head off.
[00:25:19.137 --> 00:25:19.757]  What do they say?
[00:25:20.058 --> 00:25:22.321]  Turn your guns in or killers will blow your head off!
[00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:24.491]  There's killers everywhere!
[00:25:24.511 --> 00:25:26.573]  They're gonna come kill everybody at your schools!
[00:25:26.854 --> 00:25:28.195]  That we made gun-free zones!
[00:25:28.515 --> 00:25:30.638]  Nobody points out the elephant in the room.
[00:25:31.358 --> 00:25:32.780]  The government did this.
[00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:35.122]  They put people on the psychotropics.
[00:25:35.463 --> 00:25:37.305]  They created the zombie society.
[00:25:37.625 --> 00:25:44.953]  They pushed it, and they advertise... In fact, I can't believe there haven't been more real school shootings after them hyping this like it's the end of the world.
[00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:48.823]  They're using terrorism to hold us hostage.
[00:25:49.123 --> 00:25:51.988]  And so Obama gets up and says, hey, give us a vote.
[00:25:52.008 --> 00:25:55.494]  90% want this, implying gun control.
[00:25:56.414 --> 00:26:08.401]  When the poll they did of university, you know, minions, it's like all the climate gate garbage, was like, do you think we should keep guns out of the hands of criminals and have a universal background check?
[00:26:08.781 --> 00:26:09.862]  Oh yes I do!
[00:26:09.882 --> 00:26:16.806]  You know, polling people like the Democratic state rep who says we've got to ban clips because after you use them, you throw them away.
[00:26:17.046 --> 00:26:18.507]  They're only good to use once.
[00:26:19.087 --> 00:26:21.509]  You see, you've got the globalists that know they've got a public.
[00:26:21.969 --> 00:26:23.110]  You've got two different publics.
[00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:36.415]  You've got a public that's awake and aware, and then you've got the public that literally are as dumb as the day is long, the most gullible, soft, stupid, pathetic, on the government dole.
[00:26:36.455 --> 00:26:37.815]  And I don't just mean welfare people.
[00:26:38.036 --> 00:26:39.436]  I mean all the government types.
[00:26:39.816 --> 00:26:41.117]  You know them, you've run into them.
[00:26:41.397 --> 00:26:43.778]  These people couldn't find their butts with both hands.
[00:26:44.298 --> 00:26:47.821]  And they are so pathetic, the code enforcers and all of them.
[00:26:48.061 --> 00:26:51.443]  They love to come and get in your face and dominate you.
[00:26:51.483 --> 00:27:00.309]  I've been around these people where they're getting off on getting in your space and getting off on trying to freak you out because they're pathetic, nobody, weak cowards!
[00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:04.032]  And it's pathetic that we let scum like this run our lives!
[00:27:07.372 --> 00:27:12.116]  And then meanwhile they say we've got to take your rights because of Al-Qaeda when NATO runs Al-Qaeda in Libya and Syria.
[00:27:12.416 --> 00:27:14.457]  It's all a giant hoax.
[00:27:14.517 --> 00:27:34.713]  And coming up, remember all the articles last year saying, oh, Infowars is lying, DrudgeReport.com is lying, there's no domestic drones, when we had all the local articles, and now they're back doing it again, but they just tell their followers, there's no death panels, there's no two billion bullets, there's no drone sweetie pie.
[00:27:35.833 --> 00:27:38.275]  The clips, you throw those away after you use them.
[00:27:40.216 --> 00:27:46.058]  And the children were kidnapped by bad men and a bad woman, their parents, and taken to Cuba, run to Cuba.
[00:27:46.078 --> 00:27:47.159]  You gotta run to Cuba.
[00:27:47.479 --> 00:27:48.820]  Gotta run to another tyranny now.
[00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:50.481]  I don't think they...
[00:27:51.667 --> 00:27:55.750]  I guess they've already re-educated everybody in Cuba so there's no need to take people from their parents.
[00:27:56.010 --> 00:27:58.092]  Or I guess Latin Americans won't put up with that.
[00:27:58.112 --> 00:28:08.660]  You know, that's why communism has never flown, it's been able to take over, but it never can kill millions of people, it can never totally set up the Chinese or Soviet-style tyranny.
[00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:12.963]  Because the Latin Americans love their kids too much and just won't let the state take them.
[00:28:14.019 --> 00:28:26.823]  I mean, they've got Stalinistic, you know, youth brigades in North Korea in places, but, and they've got some youth brigades in Cuba, they've got some youth brigades under Chavez, but it never really gets super nasty where they're just taking good families' kids en masse.
[00:28:27.824 --> 00:28:29.284]  I guess that's kind of the Latin America thing.
[00:28:29.884 --> 00:28:32.285]  Tony Montana, no women, no kids.
[00:28:32.965 --> 00:28:34.326]  But see, not Obama.
[00:28:34.366 --> 00:28:37.447]  He'll kill women and kids all day long using Al-Qaeda.
[00:28:38.267 --> 00:28:40.988]  And then it's cute, and it's funny, and it's for the children.
[00:28:42.847 --> 00:28:59.440]  And to see this lying opportunist that works for foreign banks, who's bankrupting the country, $85 billion a month to foreign banks, butchering everything, shutting down our power plants, shutting down our factories, paying to ship General Motors to China, just shutting our country down.
[00:29:00.381 --> 00:29:09.749]  Hardcore agent of the globalists, and then up there with families going, it's for these families, 90% of us want it, let us have a vote in the Senate.
[00:29:11.786 --> 00:29:15.848]  And let me tell you, they keep saying, we can't let this happen one more time.
[00:29:16.528 --> 00:29:20.329]  We can't let this happen one more time.
[00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:24.491]  We can't let this happen one more time.
[00:29:25.171 --> 00:29:28.332]  Every time there's a shoot-in, they'll go, see what you did not turning your guns in.
[00:29:28.613 --> 00:29:34.375]  And there's no logic of, oh, Chicago has the highest crime rate in the world and have taken the people's guns.
[00:29:34.935 --> 00:29:36.716]  There's never, why'd you make it a gun-free zone?
[00:29:36.756 --> 00:29:39.098]  It's always, you did it, you killed the kids.
[00:29:39.158 --> 00:29:43.380]  Bloomberg says, I got the billions of dollars out of the fraudulent derivatives market.
[00:29:44.601 --> 00:29:58.249]  It's just a total globalist New World Order up there saying what you're going to drink, what you're going to eat, what you're going to do, while the CPS of New York under him takes mainly black kids and tests drugs and pesticides on them until they die.
[00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:00.210]  We're on the march.
[00:30:00.711 --> 00:30:02.212]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:05.886]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:10.174 --> 00:31:17.158]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[00:31:17.398 --> 00:31:35.028]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[00:31:35.289 --> 00:31:39.411]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[00:31:39.671 --> 00:31:41.252]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[00:31:41.452 --> 00:31:49.298]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.

[00:32:18.875 --> 00:32:22.316]  As a result, millions are stockpiling food, gold, and weapons.
[00:32:22.556 --> 00:32:26.718]  But how will these items help if you or one of your loved ones becomes ill?
[00:32:27.018 --> 00:32:31.720]  Supernatural silver is the ultimate tool to prepare you for a medical emergency.

[00:33:13.698 --> 00:33:15.199]  We are on the march.
[00:33:15.559 --> 00:33:18.000]  The Empire is on the run.
[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:22.542]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:28.885 --> 00:33:39.210]  This is pure authoritarianism where a father in Long Island, his 10-year-old reportedly was beat up by some older kids so they joked
[00:33:40.293 --> 00:33:42.714]  About, hey, we ought to get water guns and squirt them.
[00:33:43.475 --> 00:33:47.937]  So the police came and interrogated everybody and they said, yeah, we talked about having a water gun fight.
[00:33:48.798 --> 00:33:51.519]  And so they, I mean, they admit it's over a water gun.
[00:33:51.539 --> 00:33:58.503]  So they go back to the guy's house, the father, and they confiscate his firearms.
[00:33:58.563 --> 00:34:01.004]  No judge, no jury, no order, no nothing.
[00:34:02.285 --> 00:34:06.367]  Just like they're now announcing they're already raiding federal pension funds.
[00:34:09.867 --> 00:34:16.591]  And they're going to raid all the local funds and all these fools out there who work for the system.
[00:34:16.631 --> 00:34:23.316]  We're going to lose everything because you went along with this and the general public as well.
[00:34:23.356 --> 00:34:28.099]  The main reason this is all happening is the general public is on party time.
[00:34:28.399 --> 00:34:29.760]  People want to work at their job.
[00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:35.644]  They want to go home and watch television and get drunk or take drugs or play video games all day.
[00:34:37.039 --> 00:34:44.603]  There's a mass narcissism upon the general population as well, where people are just very, very shallow and very, very scared.
[00:34:44.643 --> 00:34:57.191]  Now, there is a large portion of people across the political spectrum who are aware, who are upset, who are informed, and if you read a Homeland Security manual, none of it has to do, and they're all public, there's new ones out this week,
[00:34:58.366 --> 00:34:59.887]  None of it is about Al Qaeda.
[00:35:00.487 --> 00:35:04.649]  None of it is about Muslim extremists, which they set all this up on the auspices of.
[00:35:04.969 --> 00:35:08.211]  And I told you, I said, this is going to be for constitutionalists.
[00:35:08.531 --> 00:35:11.893]  This is going to be for anti-globalists, because this is a globalist takeover.
[00:35:12.573 --> 00:35:14.394]  I know who the globalists have always targeted.
[00:35:14.854 --> 00:35:16.315]  I know who stands in their way.
[00:35:17.175 --> 00:35:18.616]  They've ratified the UN Treaty.
[00:35:20.583 --> 00:35:21.263]  At the UN.
[00:35:21.323 --> 00:35:22.724]  Now they want the Senate to ratify it.
[00:35:23.204 --> 00:35:26.945]  And they're setting it up where, all right, there's one more school shooting, it's your fault.
[00:35:27.645 --> 00:35:29.346]  Oh, there was another school shooting.
[00:35:29.726 --> 00:35:31.946]  See, America wins enough enough.
[00:35:32.887 --> 00:35:39.749]  And that's why Bloomberg and Feinstein and Michael Moore have all said, there'll be more shootings and we're going to get your guns.
[00:35:40.029 --> 00:35:44.450]  And they've also bragged, the head of the Violence Policy Center, hey, we've got your kids.
[00:35:47.213 --> 00:35:51.314]  They said this to me in the news, you know, in a response to the local paper 13 years ago.
[00:35:52.195 --> 00:35:57.096]  They said, it doesn't matter what Mr. Jones does coming to all our rallies and bullhorning us.
[00:35:57.356 --> 00:35:59.897]  It doesn't matter what bribery he catches at the Capitol.
[00:36:00.257 --> 00:36:01.838]  It doesn't matter what he does.
[00:36:01.958 --> 00:36:05.239]  We've got your kids, was the quote.
[00:36:05.859 --> 00:36:07.559]  We've got your kids.
[00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:09.620]  We've got your kids.
[00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:12.141]  I mean, it's just creepy off the chart.
[00:36:14.807 --> 00:36:19.951]  They want to destroy and break the human cycle forever, and then make us literally slaves.
[00:36:22.192 --> 00:36:24.194]  That's what slavery is, is to break up the family.
[00:36:24.234 --> 00:36:27.296]  That's the heart of it, because they want your allegiance to them.
[00:36:27.756 --> 00:36:30.839]  They want to be in full control, because they crave it.
[00:36:31.279 --> 00:36:34.201]  And they are using the poor, dead children.
[00:36:36.122 --> 00:36:43.528]  Here is Obama's speech yesterday, an excerpt of it, saying 90% support this legislation.
[00:36:44.642 --> 00:36:46.563]  And they use, no other poll shows it.
[00:36:48.524 --> 00:36:48.864]  Polls.
[00:36:48.925 --> 00:36:52.186]  Support for new gun control drops by double-digit margins at Sandy Hook.
[00:36:53.367 --> 00:36:54.568]  A CBS poll.
[00:36:58.770 --> 00:37:00.951]  Only 47% believe they should be stricter.
[00:37:00.972 --> 00:37:02.072]  And you know those are push polls.
[00:37:02.492 --> 00:37:04.454]  More like 25% is the numbers I've got.
[00:37:06.375 --> 00:37:08.376]  NPR ran a poll, showed the same numbers.
[00:37:10.217 --> 00:37:11.277]  But see, they don't care.
[00:37:13.119 --> 00:37:13.719]  They don't care.
[00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:24.142]  They sit there and they say, 90% want this, and we're a democracy, and so it's time to turn in the guns.
[00:37:24.482 --> 00:37:25.702]  Well, we're not a democracy.
[00:37:25.722 --> 00:37:27.583]  And I get people that say, well, it's about the people.
[00:37:27.783 --> 00:37:32.704]  When we have foreign oligarchs, foreign megabanks running us, you can argue, well, let's be a democracy, let's run things.
[00:37:33.024 --> 00:37:33.564]  No, no, no, no.
[00:37:33.824 --> 00:37:37.285]  You've got a dumbed-down mass of people that in emotional moments
[00:37:38.325 --> 00:37:47.412]  They can say, hey, let's take all the guns and the 51% vote for it, or the electronic voting machines say so, then all of the other 49% have got to turn their guns in.
[00:37:49.653 --> 00:37:59.620]  Under a democracy, you could say, 51% say, make all Native Americans report to be executed.
[00:38:00.001 --> 00:38:02.883]  And then they'd have to report to be executed because the majority said so.
[00:38:04.758 --> 00:38:08.218]  And even though we were a republic, we followed the democracy idea.
[00:38:09.534 --> 00:38:15.077]  Because you already had indentured servants and white slaves by another name, so why not have black slaves?
[00:38:15.657 --> 00:38:17.198]  So I was like, well, they're two-thirds human.
[00:38:17.938 --> 00:38:20.339]  And, you know, so they don't get their rights of a republic.
[00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:22.160]  And plus, it's a democracy.
[00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:35.447]  Now, under the republic, and people reading the rules of the republic, Bill of Rights, Constitution, Declaration of Independence, the idea of the republic was then more and more fully expressed and used as a template of liberty worldwide.
[00:38:35.807 --> 00:38:37.088]  That's why it's run down.
[00:38:37.788 --> 00:38:39.809]  The Constitution and Bill of Rights haven't failed.
[00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:42.191]  We have failed to enforce it.
[00:38:42.551 --> 00:38:45.794]  We have failed to breathe life into it.
[00:38:46.714 --> 00:38:49.716]  And so Obama says, hey, we're a democracy.
[00:38:50.097 --> 00:39:05.047]  The majority of people want these measures passed, which he calls reasonable, which are arresting people with over 10 round mags, banning most semi-autos, registering all the other guns, and not letting you transfer guns to friends and family.
[00:39:07.728 --> 00:39:10.350]  I mean, they've taken the guns everywhere else they're in control.
[00:39:10.431 --> 00:39:11.391]  That needs to be the message.
[00:39:11.552 --> 00:39:18.978]  Everywhere you're in control, you use these arguments to register and then confiscate, and everywhere you're in control in America, you've totally taken the guns.
[00:39:19.399 --> 00:39:20.440]  Shut up, liars!
[00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:21.901]  And stop lying to me!
[00:39:22.121 --> 00:39:31.190]  And stop pinning those dead kids on me when you made it to gun-free zone, and you advertised it for the place for your Prozac heads to go kill people!
[00:39:32.930 --> 00:39:33.470]  You shouldn't be.
[00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:34.311]  Hey, be reasonable.
[00:39:34.351 --> 00:39:35.251]  Don't blame me for that.
[00:39:35.812 --> 00:39:38.573]  Crimes dropped 49% because of gun ownership going up.
[00:39:38.613 --> 00:39:39.474]  Why are you blaming us?
[00:39:39.834 --> 00:39:40.695]  Man, you're stupid.
[00:39:41.575 --> 00:39:42.536]  They're not stupid.
[00:39:42.816 --> 00:39:53.802]  They're the most mechanized, organized, formed foreign banking cartel that's completely above the law and pays zero taxes and is shutting everything down in the West and transferring it to Europe.
[00:39:54.583 --> 00:39:59.626]  And then from Europe, they're transferring it over to Asia and the people aren't even getting the benefits there.
[00:40:00.729 --> 00:40:10.578]  Mass suicides, forced abortions, suicide nets, mobile execution vans, hell on earth, race to the bottom that Ross Perot warned us about.
[00:40:10.598 --> 00:40:12.520]  There's going to be a giant second sound.
[00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:16.203]  The average American industrial worker is making about $30 an hour, Larry.
[00:40:18.342 --> 00:40:21.744]  Now, we've got lower wages than Canada, and we've lowered them.
[00:40:22.104 --> 00:40:25.066]  Mexico, the average industrial worker, is about a dollar an hour, Larry.
[00:40:25.807 --> 00:40:30.790]  You're going to see our wages within just a year after this is implemented go down to about $15, Larry.
[00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:32.591]  That's a cut of half, Larry.
[00:40:33.252 --> 00:40:38.755]  You can go watch the Ross Perot-Al Gore debates from CNN on YouTube.
[00:40:38.855 --> 00:40:40.076]  Last time I checked, they're up there.
[00:40:40.276 --> 00:40:40.937]  Both debates.
[00:40:41.717 --> 00:40:45.700]  And he's getting so mad, he's going, listen, listen, this isn't about competitiveness.
[00:40:46.624 --> 00:40:50.248]  You cannot compete with no environmental standards and no regulations that are put on us.
[00:40:50.689 --> 00:40:52.771]  You will see the de-industrialization.
[00:40:52.992 --> 00:40:58.258]  And once studies show, Larry, be quiet, Gore, I'm trying to talk, this is my time.
[00:40:58.979 --> 00:41:02.363]  The studies show that once you lose an industrial base, it does not come back.
[00:41:02.983 --> 00:41:05.386]  And it's not going to raise up China and Mexico, Larry.
[00:41:05.426 --> 00:41:06.668]  It's going to lower them down as well.
[00:41:09.468 --> 00:41:14.313]  And Al Gore would go, this is a good deal, Larry.
[00:41:14.333 --> 00:41:17.917]  And the media would laugh at Ross Perot.
[00:41:20.461 --> 00:41:24.403]  See, because they're going for the sheeple, where they'll put a laugh track, you know, on the comedy shows.
[00:41:24.683 --> 00:41:26.063]  Let's laugh at Ross Perot.
[00:41:26.303 --> 00:41:27.504]  You're laughing now, aren't you?
[00:41:27.924 --> 00:41:35.647]  Let's laugh at people that warned you about government-run healthcare, how it would butcher the economy, shut down everything, double the rates, written by insurance companies.
[00:41:35.967 --> 00:41:38.448]  If you make people buy something, what's going to happen?
[00:41:38.488 --> 00:41:42.289]  They can raise the price stratospherically while debasing the quality of the product.
[00:41:44.010 --> 00:41:46.071]  That's why North Korea can't produce an automobile.
[00:41:47.028 --> 00:41:49.050]  I mean, this is 101 fact.
[00:41:49.130 --> 00:42:03.863]  I mean, this is like going into the doctor and they go, you've got lung cancer and if we remove the polyp, you've got a 90% operability you're going to live, but that cancer within six months kills 99% of people that get it.
[00:42:03.923 --> 00:42:04.704]  Here's the name of it.
[00:42:04.964 --> 00:42:06.506]  You got to cut it out right now.
[00:42:08.376 --> 00:42:10.776]  And I'm here going, folks, we've got to cut this out right now!
[00:42:11.277 --> 00:42:11.977]  Right now!
[00:42:12.777 --> 00:42:14.017]  Right now!
[00:42:14.277 --> 00:42:15.097]  Right now!
[00:42:15.637 --> 00:42:17.798]  This isn't just socialists taking over.
[00:42:18.538 --> 00:42:28.660]  France has got a 75% tax rate across the board on anybody working, and now they've got a 75% tax rate on top of whatever you keep after that.
[00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:31.460]  So you've got 25% left, and then 75% of 25, what, you keep 5%.
[00:42:37.637 --> 00:42:38.558]  There's even less than that.
[00:42:39.038 --> 00:42:40.219]  What's the math?
[00:42:40.399 --> 00:42:41.060]  75% tax.
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:51.369]  And then it comes out that all the ruling class and the Rothschilds and all the elite aren't paying the taxes and are exempt just like EU bureaucrats and have Swiss bank accounts.
[00:42:52.176 --> 00:42:52.816]  Here's the headline.
[00:42:52.836 --> 00:42:54.777]  French politicians rush to reveal their assets.
[00:42:55.538 --> 00:42:57.499]  French president struggles in tax crisis.
[00:42:57.879 --> 00:43:02.642]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a mafia system that started in France.
[00:43:02.742 --> 00:43:06.284]  It's called the Jacobins, who were the Illuminati.
[00:43:06.584 --> 00:43:09.145]  If you want to know their goals, research the French Revolution.
[00:43:11.206 --> 00:43:12.947]  The overthrow of the family.
[00:43:13.087 --> 00:43:14.648]  Have you heard of this before?
[00:43:14.668 --> 00:43:18.730]  A nine-day work week, changing the seasons.
[00:43:18.830 --> 00:43:19.811]  They want to play God.
[00:43:21.991 --> 00:43:23.852]  They talk about trampling and being trampled.
[00:43:24.112 --> 00:43:25.413]  Being the priest of power.
[00:43:25.853 --> 00:43:27.874]  Ripping people's teeth out with pliers.
[00:43:28.635 --> 00:43:29.055]  Blood.
[00:43:29.155 --> 00:43:29.455]  Death.
[00:43:29.595 --> 00:43:29.935]  Murder.
[00:43:30.035 --> 00:43:30.676]  Red Terror.
[00:43:31.056 --> 00:43:31.696]  Red Terror.
[00:43:32.056 --> 00:43:32.737]  Red Terror.
[00:43:33.057 --> 00:43:33.717]  Red Terror.
[00:43:34.057 --> 00:43:34.638]  Red Terror.
[00:43:35.098 --> 00:43:34.638]  1800.
[00:43:35.318 --> 00:43:36.178]  Red Terror.
[00:43:36.379 --> 00:43:37.479]  It didn't start with Lenin.
[00:43:37.799 --> 00:43:38.580]  Another Jacobin.
[00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:39.700]  Red Terror.
[00:43:40.381 --> 00:43:41.141]  Red Terror.
[00:43:41.321 --> 00:43:42.482]  Red Rum.
[00:43:42.882 --> 00:43:44.143]  Red Rum.
[00:43:44.463 --> 00:43:45.683]  Here's Johnny.
[00:43:46.844 --> 00:43:49.286]  You turn these people loose, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:43:49.506 --> 00:43:50.667]  This is not socialism.
[00:43:50.887 --> 00:43:51.967]  This is not communism.
[00:43:51.987 --> 00:43:52.808]  Those are all just names.
[00:43:53.008 --> 00:43:55.249]  This is authoritarian power trip-ism.
[00:43:56.010 --> 00:43:57.991]  This is mad dogs turned loose.
[00:43:58.251 --> 00:44:00.413]  Let's go to Obama, pimping the dead kids.
[00:44:00.873 --> 00:44:07.617]  Pimping the... and there's some parents involved at Sandy Hook who are saying they're pro-gun, but you'll never see them on the local news.
[00:44:07.838 --> 00:44:09.779]  They're on the local city council testifying.
[00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:15.963]  You'll see them up there with President Obama saying, you're to blame for what happened.
[00:44:16.775 --> 00:44:17.956]  Isn't that the collectivist model?
[00:44:18.176 --> 00:44:20.758]  Your kid talked about a water gun, your gun's turned in.
[00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:25.802]  That story's up on DrugsReport.com on the left-hand side right now.
[00:44:27.323 --> 00:44:28.844]  Let's go ahead and go to the Club of Obama.
[00:44:28.884 --> 00:44:29.845]  Here he is last night.
[00:44:30.706 --> 00:44:38.011]  There's only one thing that can stand in the way of change that just about everybody agrees on, and that's politics in Washington.
[00:44:38.051 --> 00:44:42.975]  You would think that with those numbers, Congress would rush to make this happen.
[00:44:44.696 --> 00:44:45.497]  That's what you would think.
[00:44:48.706 --> 00:44:50.846]  Total treason, trying to overthrow a republic.
[00:44:52.627 --> 00:44:54.907]  If our democracy is working the way it's supposed to.
[00:44:54.927 --> 00:44:55.588]  We're a republic.
[00:44:56.288 --> 00:44:59.128]  And 90% of the American people agree on something.
[00:45:01.029 --> 00:45:07.330]  In the wake of a tragedy, you'd think this would not be a heavy lift.
[00:45:07.810 --> 00:45:09.891]  He spends a million dollars a night in hotels.
[00:45:09.911 --> 00:45:15.672]  And yet some folks back in Washington are already floating the idea that they may use
[00:45:16.548 --> 00:45:19.910]  These people are openly criminal.
[00:45:19.930 --> 00:45:21.791]  You have to understand, they know they're criminal.
[00:45:21.811 --> 00:45:24.552]  Remember, Gibbs said he was supposed to lie about drones?
[00:45:25.193 --> 00:45:29.255]  They're not just saying they'll vote no on ideas that almost all Americans support.
[00:45:30.135 --> 00:45:36.278]  They're saying they'll do everything they can to even prevent any votes on these provisions.
[00:45:36.538 --> 00:45:38.540]  They're saying your opinion doesn't matter.
[00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:39.360]  That's not right.
[00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:40.220]  That is not right.
[00:45:43.988 --> 00:45:44.648]  That is not right?
[00:45:45.189 --> 00:45:47.070]  The fact that you're a Peace Prize winner is not right.
[00:45:48.611 --> 00:45:51.033]  The fact that you signed the NDAA to secretly arrest us.
[00:45:51.053 --> 00:45:53.054]  The fact that you're buying two billion bullets.
[00:45:53.074 --> 00:45:55.035]  Look at him, he looks like Hitler or Mao Zedong up there.
[00:45:57.016 --> 00:45:59.478]  Let me tell you, he's got enough idiots, folks, he'll take over.
[00:45:59.798 --> 00:46:01.099]  Look at them all smiling.
[00:46:01.139 --> 00:46:02.080]  They hate gun owners.
[00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:03.641]  This isn't about dead kids.
[00:46:04.001 --> 00:46:06.042]  It's about their takeover, their collectivism.
[00:46:07.163 --> 00:46:09.925]  All those bureaucrats, all those federal workers.
[00:46:11.986 --> 00:46:12.927]  The federal family.
[00:46:13.809 --> 00:46:29.925]  I've also heard some in the Washington press suggest that what happens to gun violence legislation in Congress this week will either be a political victory or defeat for me.
[00:46:32.924 --> 00:46:33.825]  Oh, he's so hurt.
[00:46:34.145 --> 00:46:36.086]  Connecticut, this is not about me.
[00:46:36.367 --> 00:46:37.588]  This is about overthrowing America.
[00:46:37.628 --> 00:46:38.989]  This is not about politics.
[00:46:39.009 --> 00:46:39.789]  This is about the U.N.
[00:46:39.809 --> 00:46:39.989]  treaty.
[00:46:40.009 --> 00:46:45.633]  This is about doing the right thing for all the families who are here that have been torn apart by gun violence.
[00:46:45.653 --> 00:46:46.594]  This is about eugenics.
[00:46:47.075 --> 00:46:49.496]  It's about them and all the families going forward.
[00:46:49.596 --> 00:46:50.637]  That's right.
[00:46:50.717 --> 00:46:53.199]  If you don't do whatever he says, you're against the families.
[00:46:53.279 --> 00:46:54.260]  That's what it's about.
[00:46:55.682 --> 00:46:59.906]  It's about the law enforcement officials putting their lives at risk!
[00:46:59.926 --> 00:47:01.787]  That's what this is about!
[00:47:01.867 --> 00:47:14.498]  It's about the families and it's about the armed police and the collaborator police from all over the country traveling up there like ghouls to say you turn your guns in or you're with the criminals.
[00:47:14.558 --> 00:47:16.299]  That's the quote of our local police chief.
[00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:19.242]  You go along with this initiative or you're with the criminals.
[00:47:20.987 --> 00:47:21.528]  You're with?
[00:47:21.568 --> 00:47:21.908]  You know what?
[00:47:22.228 --> 00:47:23.329]  I'm not with the criminals.
[00:47:23.569 --> 00:47:26.312]  Barack Obama's with the foreign banks that hijacked this country.
[00:47:26.552 --> 00:47:27.293]  And you're with them.
[00:47:27.513 --> 00:47:28.634]  And we see you.
[00:47:29.034 --> 00:47:30.536]  And we know who you are.
[00:47:30.856 --> 00:47:32.257]  And we know what you're doing.
[00:47:32.498 --> 00:47:36.501]  And we've already voted with hundreds of millions of guns bought the last four years.
[00:47:37.182 --> 00:47:40.104]  Seventy million background checks the last two years.
[00:47:41.566 --> 00:47:42.926]  70 million plus.
[00:47:43.447 --> 00:47:44.347]  We've already voted.
[00:47:44.527 --> 00:47:45.888]  You see the ammo all bought up.
[00:47:46.088 --> 00:47:46.929]  We've already voted.
[00:47:47.269 --> 00:47:47.569]  We know.
[00:47:47.909 --> 00:47:48.690]  We've already voted.
[00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:49.590]  We're speaking out.
[00:47:49.851 --> 00:47:51.131]  We're not just bunkered down.
[00:47:51.552 --> 00:47:54.213]  We've prepared a defense, but we're on the offense.
[00:47:54.273 --> 00:47:57.095]  And we know you're on the offense with your world government.
[00:47:59.361 --> 00:48:02.842]  You could have the Southern Poverty Law Center and the ADL come out and say none of this exists.
[00:48:03.842 --> 00:48:04.422]  But you know what?
[00:48:04.842 --> 00:48:10.384]  The newest army training manual of how to take on Christians, all Catholics are listed as terrorists.
[00:48:11.384 --> 00:48:14.725]  And evangelicals are listed as terrorists.
[00:48:14.745 --> 00:48:15.905]  They list them with Al Qaeda.
[00:48:16.145 --> 00:48:16.526]  Period.
[00:48:16.846 --> 00:48:21.667]  You people are the flaming weirdo authoritarians saying, openly,
[00:48:22.549 --> 00:48:23.870]  Your kids belong to the state.
[00:48:24.551 --> 00:48:27.113]  We're gonna give your kids shots and abortions without asking you.
[00:48:27.333 --> 00:48:37.520]  Jocelyn Elders, up there like a weirdo in those hearings where she starts shuffling back and forth going, it's good to do it, to teach the kindergartners how to do it.
[00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:39.842]  You help them reach down!
[00:48:40.423 --> 00:48:41.804]  Reach down!
[00:48:41.884 --> 00:48:45.366]  I mean, it's all about reaching down at the TSA.
[00:48:45.887 --> 00:48:48.128]  Let me tell you, you wanna know how dangerous government is?
[00:48:48.529 --> 00:48:50.050]  The state police of Texas,
[00:48:52.685 --> 00:49:09.927]  The commandant, the head of the state police, backed his regional boss when they defended in Dallas, pulling two women over with the same glove and going inside both of their orifices
[00:49:10.868 --> 00:49:15.633]  Four orifices of the two sisters with a filthy glove, cramming their hand into them.
[00:49:15.853 --> 00:49:17.274]  I'm sorry to talk like this in America.
[00:49:17.835 --> 00:49:19.736]  And the police came out and said, we do this all the time.
[00:49:19.776 --> 00:49:20.557]  This is what we do now.
[00:49:21.178 --> 00:49:22.619]  And the public flipped out.
[00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:25.161]  And people said, well, I'm going to have to resist that.
[00:49:25.422 --> 00:49:27.664]  And so they backed off and the grand juries indicted them.
[00:49:29.312 --> 00:49:31.052]  You see, that's how tyranny works.
[00:49:31.352 --> 00:49:32.813]  You just start saying, yes, yes, yes.
[00:49:33.113 --> 00:49:33.693]  Yes, yes, yes.
[00:49:34.093 --> 00:49:35.253]  Oh, they're the authorities.
[00:49:35.493 --> 00:49:38.114]  Let's respect the authorities, like Obama just said.
[00:49:38.374 --> 00:49:42.455]  And the law enforcement professionals that have got their lives on the line every day.
[00:49:42.475 --> 00:49:46.176]  49% drop in crime everywhere there's proliferation of guns.
[00:49:46.756 --> 00:49:52.117]  The most dangerous place in America for police is in Chicago, where you and your mafia run things.
[00:49:52.157 --> 00:49:53.578]  You mafia dirtbag.
[00:49:53.778 --> 00:49:54.598]  Go back to Obama.
[00:49:55.253 --> 00:49:59.077]  ...families going forward so we can prevent this from happening again.
[00:49:59.097 --> 00:50:00.298]  That's what it's about.
[00:50:00.358 --> 00:50:04.342]  It's about the law enforcement officials putting their lives at risk.
[00:50:04.562 --> 00:50:05.863]  That's what this is about.
[00:50:05.923 --> 00:50:08.486]  It's not about politics.
[00:50:16.625 --> 00:50:17.726]  This is not about politics.
[00:50:18.167 --> 00:50:18.587]  Oh, no.
[00:50:18.607 --> 00:50:19.688]  It's not about politics.
[00:50:19.748 --> 00:50:24.593]  It's about what a weird, twisted CIA freak Rockefeller front you've been since birth.
[00:50:25.034 --> 00:50:29.318]  This is about these families and families all across the country.
[00:50:29.338 --> 00:50:29.659]  Uh-huh.
[00:50:31.961 --> 00:50:33.883]  Who think clips are disposable.
[00:50:35.705 --> 00:50:36.986]  For our kids to get gunned down.
[00:50:37.727 --> 00:50:38.768]  Our kids to get gunned down.
[00:50:40.996 --> 00:50:50.283]  When I said in my State of the Union address that these proposals deserve a vote, that families of Newtown and Aurora... They had to get the guns now because they know we're rising.
[00:50:50.423 --> 00:50:52.425]  And so they're putting everything they've got.
[00:50:52.465 --> 00:50:55.587]  Folks, this is the full enemy... This is the Battle of the Bulge.
[00:50:55.848 --> 00:50:59.410]  They're launching their Nazi counteroffensive because we're kicking their butt.
[00:50:59.571 --> 00:51:00.071]  That's enough!
[00:51:00.111 --> 00:51:01.312]  Get that traitor off there!
[00:51:01.592 --> 00:51:02.653]  Get him off there!
[00:51:03.013 --> 00:51:04.014]  That's not our president.
[00:51:04.574 --> 00:51:08.718]  That's a foreign New World Order collaborator, Vichy French agent.
[00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:18.963]  Devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, or the threat of martial law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies.
[00:51:19.264 --> 00:51:22.705]  As a result, millions are stockpiling food, gold, and weapons.

[00:54:34.926 --> 00:54:46.460]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're back live, and I know that I am ranting and raving about the unprecedented mega-tyranny that our society is.
[00:54:48.208 --> 00:54:48.769]  Go ahead.
[00:55:01.755 --> 00:55:03.096]  Whose propaganda is everywhere.
[00:55:03.116 --> 00:55:05.098]  I saw a Costco magazine last night.
[00:55:05.699 --> 00:55:14.607]  It's like 80 pages thick for Costco customers and it was Bill and Melinda Gates chairman on the front and all how much he loves people and I looked him up.
[00:55:14.668 --> 00:55:24.157]  He's on the board of Costco bringing everything in from China and the whole magazine was like anti-human eugenics, but how much they love the kids and how they want to give them the shots.
[00:55:26.570 --> 00:55:30.872]  And then you look at the whole background of that, everything they're doing is the opposite of what they say they're doing.
[00:55:30.892 --> 00:55:36.174]  And I just thought about the gullible public reading this and believing it, how childlike they are.
[00:55:38.174 --> 00:55:45.457]  How they have absolutely no idea what's coming down on them.
[00:55:46.889 --> 00:55:48.230]  We've got a family coming on.
[00:55:48.270 --> 00:55:53.373]  The former founding lead singer of Anthrax and he and his wife are very well known.
[00:55:53.413 --> 00:55:57.036]  I've been speaking out against what autism is, what the shots have done with autism.
[00:55:57.436 --> 00:55:58.997]  That's going to be coming up later in the next hour.
[00:55:59.017 --> 00:56:02.359]  We're going to get into a whole other area of news as well.
[00:56:02.439 --> 00:56:05.221]  Big sis testing drones that can detect guns.
[00:56:05.241 --> 00:56:06.062]  We're going to get into that.
[00:56:06.382 --> 00:56:13.547]  They're running new ads with the new town people saying that, hey, we need to restrict the Second Amendment for our children.
[00:56:13.567 --> 00:56:16.689]  We're going to be getting into all of that information.
[00:56:18.691 --> 00:56:22.235]  And we're also going to be breaking down the incredible North Korea developments.
[00:56:22.275 --> 00:56:28.522]  North Korea to launch missile tomorrow after warning foreigners to evacuate the South.
[00:56:30.114 --> 00:56:33.556]  That is just unprecedented, and saying prepare for big explosions.
[00:56:33.576 --> 00:56:37.478]  You know, we're aiming missiles at you, prepare for explosions, that's an open threat.
[00:56:37.838 --> 00:56:49.124]  And again, it's some whacked out, crazy government on a power trip that's angry that a country south of it had more freedom, and so is the fastest growing country in the world, and has seen the biggest increase in wealth.
[00:56:49.665 --> 00:56:51.526]  But see, we're not going in the direction of South Korea.
[00:56:51.546 --> 00:56:55.768]  We're going in the direction of North Korea, all because we let a bunch of freaks boss us around.
[00:56:55.788 --> 00:56:57.149]  I'm so sick of it!
[00:56:58.638 --> 00:57:13.113]  By the way, ladies and gentlemen, everything we promote at Infowarsstore.com has been well-researched and has the best prices, whether it's ProPure water filtration systems with promo code WATER, you can get 10% off on the Gravity Fed stainless steel systems that annihilate the competition.

[00:57:42.355 --> 00:57:47.139]  I'm not playing it safe here, because there's no future if we don't double and triple down.
[00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:51.784]  Again, this is a hardcore, virulent government cancer we've got.
[00:57:52.566 --> 00:57:57.047]  Okay, and they're sickening degenerate liars that brag how they lie to us.
[00:57:57.968 --> 00:57:59.188]  Obama is not a liberal.
[00:57:59.568 --> 00:58:02.389]  I'm not for the establishment Republicans if you're a new listener.
[00:58:02.829 --> 00:58:05.410]  For heaven's sake, realize how much danger we're in.
[00:58:05.990 --> 00:58:10.711]  Obama raised taxes in many different ways, payroll, you name it, on the poorest Americans.
[00:58:11.231 --> 00:58:14.032]  He's a front man because he's liberal on the surface.
[00:58:14.452 --> 00:58:16.413]  They know they can sell a bunch of their garbage.
[00:58:17.193 --> 00:58:24.659]  So Americans have to use their energy, their word of mouth, their money to support the real alternative news today.
[00:58:24.719 --> 00:58:27.501]  And that's where InfoWars.com, the nightly news.

[00:58:41.433 --> 00:58:42.334]  Garden in a can.
[00:58:42.594 --> 00:58:43.675]  The lowest price out there.

[00:59:04.309 --> 00:59:05.230]  Tyranny is here.
[00:59:05.570 --> 00:59:09.113]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:59:09.433 --> 00:59:11.735]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:59:11.895 --> 00:59:17.199]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:59:17.599 --> 00:59:23.884]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:59:24.284 --> 00:59:29.829]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:59:30.249 --> 00:59:33.952]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.

[00:59:38.715 --> 00:59:44.218]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:59:44.658 --> 00:59:47.620]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:49.621]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:59:50.181 --> 00:59:50.661]  It's here.

[01:00:21.249 --> 01:00:22.150]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:22.790 --> 01:00:26.391]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:26.972 --> 01:00:31.093]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:35.735 --> 01:00:40.977]  Man, I was out there during the break looking at official FEMA photos of their FEMA Corps youth in
[01:00:42.648 --> 01:00:44.931]  Black uniforms and camo uniforms.
[01:00:45.732 --> 01:00:48.296]  Just totally being brainwashed with hardcore Marxism.
[01:00:48.677 --> 01:00:50.840]  But again, it's megabanks that use Marxism.
[01:00:51.701 --> 01:00:53.163]  They're above it, globally.
[01:00:53.604 --> 01:00:54.525]  It's just incredible.
[01:00:54.545 --> 01:00:55.647]  It makes me physically ill.
[01:00:57.642 --> 01:01:04.044]  And to know that we can't ever beat this because the Republicans are controlled by the same people until we fully take the states, the counties, the cities back.
[01:01:04.324 --> 01:01:06.825]  And that's why Homeland Security is set up to go after the states.
[01:01:07.785 --> 01:01:11.306]  Again, Homeland Security is a foreign occupation arm.
[01:01:11.607 --> 01:01:12.707]  There's no debating that.
[01:01:15.134 --> 01:01:22.180]  And then here is Obama pimping out the dead children and using the parents to collectively say, you know, restrict your guns.
[01:01:22.561 --> 01:01:27.225]  There can't be another one of these shootings like it's our fault when the government made it the victim disarmament zone.
[01:01:27.265 --> 01:01:27.905]  Here's that clip.
[01:01:29.227 --> 01:01:32.269]  We dropped Jesse off in the morning, December 14th.
[01:01:32.509 --> 01:01:33.791]  Gave me a hug and a kiss.
[01:01:33.951 --> 01:01:35.052]  Said I love you dad.
[01:01:35.392 --> 01:01:36.253]  I love mom too.
[01:01:36.781 --> 01:01:38.841]  Our daughter, Grace, was 7 years old.
[01:01:39.082 --> 01:01:40.662]  She couldn't wait to go to school.
[01:01:40.942 --> 01:01:42.982]  She would skip down the driveway.
[01:01:43.382 --> 01:01:45.723]  My sister loved teaching at Sandy Hook.
[01:01:46.123 --> 01:01:49.224]  Every student would say, I hope I get Miss Soto next year.
[01:01:49.264 --> 01:01:51.064]  But America had a second amendment.
[01:01:51.384 --> 01:01:52.644]  Bad America!
[01:01:52.964 --> 01:01:57.885]  I got a 911 call that there was a shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School.
[01:01:58.085 --> 01:02:01.726]  I need to remember the 26 victims who lost their lives.
[01:02:03.027 --> 01:02:04.967]  She just wanted to teach little kids.
[01:02:06.686 --> 01:02:12.968]  See how they personalize these kids, but not the hundreds they kill every week with drones?
[01:02:13.268 --> 01:02:22.391]  So cold-blooded, so over-the-top, so incredible, while the government arms itself to the teeth against the American people.
[01:02:22.411 --> 01:02:29.713]  Man, I gotta tell you, the way the people talk, they've been totally coached.
[01:02:33.991 --> 01:02:38.754]  Remember Peter Parker, where he's sitting there and he's going, haha, yeah, haha, yeah, I'll do a great job there!
[01:02:39.174 --> 01:02:39.774]  Oh, camera's on!
[01:02:44.497 --> 01:02:45.298]  I'm sorry, sir.
[01:02:45.758 --> 01:02:47.919]  I didn't send my kid to a victim disarmament zone.
[01:02:48.319 --> 01:02:54.083]  Stop blaming me for what the federal government did making it a gun-free zone.
[01:02:57.008 --> 01:03:01.892]  I mean, you're not going to see Bloomberg ads about, you know, please, the bomb dropped on our village.
[01:03:02.592 --> 01:03:05.234]  It killed over 100 people and blew the legs off my children.
[01:03:05.654 --> 01:03:06.415]  Here's my daughter.
[01:03:06.835 --> 01:03:11.239]  Oh no, it's all just like, don't let Newtown happen without you turning in your guns.
[01:03:11.599 --> 01:03:13.080]  Because you did it, America!
[01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:18.424]  You need to be like Chicago, highest crime rate in the world, where these mobsters run everything.
[01:03:18.444 --> 01:03:19.825]  We're on the radio there at 1530.
[01:03:20.005 --> 01:03:21.606]  A lot of great people in Chicago.
[01:03:22.046 --> 01:03:25.229]  Let me tell you, the criminals in the government, they know to go after the people.
[01:03:27.045 --> 01:03:39.117]  Meanwhile, we've gone from 1 in 25,000 having autism 30 years ago to 1 in 50-something, and it says on the insert it can kill your kid, and when your kid has a convulsion and dies, they're going to put you in jail.
[01:03:40.578 --> 01:03:42.180]  But there's not going to be Bloomberg with ads going,
[01:03:43.365 --> 01:03:45.187]  I took my son in for his second round of shots.
[01:03:45.207 --> 01:03:45.908]  He took the shots.
[01:03:46.529 --> 01:03:50.675]  He had convulsions in the car on the way home and then died that night at the hospital.
[01:03:51.435 --> 01:03:53.518]  Please warn everybody about what's in the vaccines.
[01:03:53.939 --> 01:03:54.920]  Something's going on.
[01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:56.242]  We've got to warn people.
[01:03:56.522 --> 01:03:58.224]  Millions of American children are damaged.
[01:03:58.545 --> 01:03:59.746]  Thousands die every year.
[01:04:00.407 --> 01:04:02.808]  There's the Vaccine Damage Fund where they cover all this up.
[01:04:03.188 --> 01:04:04.108]  Something's going on.
[01:04:04.368 --> 01:04:05.408]  We've got to warn people.
[01:04:05.889 --> 01:04:08.109]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:04:08.469 --> 01:04:13.291]  They want our guns so they can take our children, as they've said, the state.
[01:04:13.651 --> 01:04:17.872]  Our children belong to the state so they can pincushion them for all their eugenic shots.
[01:04:18.732 --> 01:04:22.954]  Again, Bloomberg's been mayor while they keep doing chemical and medical testing on kids in New York.
[01:04:22.974 --> 01:04:23.894]  Not going to hear a word about that.
[01:04:24.878 --> 01:04:28.541]  No, Bloomberg says you should have to take shots, mandatorily, without being able to.
[01:04:28.922 --> 01:04:31.564]  And they lie to everybody and say it's the law to take shots.
[01:04:31.965 --> 01:04:32.906]  Stop being ignorant.
[01:04:33.486 --> 01:04:36.929]  And you watch the newscast, when they talk about liberty, they make frowny faces.
[01:04:36.949 --> 01:04:38.711]  But when they talk about tyranny, they smile.
[01:04:39.011 --> 01:04:40.853]  Yeah, the government's running checkpoints this week!
[01:04:42.443 --> 01:04:44.664]  Next up, parents have been saying no to shots.
[01:04:44.704 --> 01:04:45.784]  Oh, look at that filth.
[01:04:46.304 --> 01:04:48.085]  Yeah, and gun owners won't turn their guns in.
[01:04:48.105 --> 01:04:48.985]  They want their kids to die.
[01:04:49.005 --> 01:04:50.586]  Yeah, nothing that filth won't do.
[01:04:51.306 --> 01:04:54.047]  Coming up next, there's a new shot out, a meningitis shot.
[01:04:54.067 --> 01:04:55.327]  Of course, we're not going to tell you.
[01:04:55.347 --> 01:04:56.248]  It kills a lot of people.
[01:04:57.068 --> 01:04:57.988]  Never mind that insert.
[01:04:58.228 --> 01:04:59.769]  There's absolutely no side effects.
[01:04:59.789 --> 01:05:00.869]  Of course, we're lying to you.
[01:05:01.410 --> 01:05:02.350]  Everything's fine, though.
[01:05:02.370 --> 01:05:03.370]  Don't get angry about it.
[01:05:03.570 --> 01:05:04.411]  Don't struggle.
[01:05:04.671 --> 01:05:06.351]  Don't get upset like Alex Jones.
[01:05:07.091 --> 01:05:08.352]  Just love your world government.
[01:05:10.037 --> 01:05:11.658]  Introducing Pro-1.
[01:05:11.918 --> 01:05:15.421]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[01:05:15.581 --> 01:05:19.984]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[01:05:20.104 --> 01:05:26.108]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[01:05:26.228 --> 01:05:37.016]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.

[01:07:13.333 --> 01:07:18.795]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[01:07:19.375 --> 01:07:22.577]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?

[01:08:14.875 --> 01:08:19.096]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:08:19.717 --> 01:08:20.537]  You want answers?
[01:08:21.297 --> 01:08:22.177]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:22.858 --> 01:08:26.459]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:27.039 --> 01:08:31.120]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:44.368 --> 01:08:45.969]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us.
[01:08:46.009 --> 01:08:47.990]  We're now into our number two.
[01:08:48.070 --> 01:09:03.437]  We have seen incredibly unprecedented fear-mongering using the crisis of 20 dead children at Sandy Hook to openly say, you turn in your guns to us or the next shooting is your fault.
[01:09:04.258 --> 01:09:12.062]  When gun proliferation has made crime drop by 49% in violent crime, FBI statistics, public information,
[01:09:13.328 --> 01:09:16.219]  Countless articles written about it, and then they're lecturing us.
[01:09:16.420 --> 01:09:17.344]  These are collectivists.
[01:09:17.364 --> 01:09:19.432]  See, collectivism should be called slavery.
[01:09:20.367 --> 01:09:22.688]  Because then, oh, your kid talks about a water gun at school?
[01:09:22.808 --> 01:09:24.109]  Your dad loses his guns.
[01:09:24.529 --> 01:09:26.950]  That story's up at DrudgeReport.com on the left-hand side.
[01:09:26.970 --> 01:09:28.851]  It's an Infowars.com story.
[01:09:29.572 --> 01:09:30.792]  PrisonPlanet.com story.
[01:09:31.933 --> 01:09:34.754]  Oh, you've got to have national compulsory service.
[01:09:34.814 --> 01:09:36.935]  Paying taxes isn't enough.
[01:09:37.416 --> 01:09:41.598]  You've got to go work every weekend so the lazy government people can lay around.
[01:09:41.878 --> 01:09:43.439]  That's all being promoted by the White House.
[01:09:43.919 --> 01:09:47.401]  And again, it's because it's what the offshore social engineer megabanks want.
[01:09:47.821 --> 01:09:49.722]  They want authoritarianism.
[01:09:50.586 --> 01:09:57.474]  That's their goal, so they can get $85 billion a month of your taxpayer money paid to offshore banks by the Federal Reserve.
[01:09:58.135 --> 01:10:04.682]  So that Biden can spend $555,000 a night in a hotel when he goes on a trip, taxpayer paid for.
[01:10:04.722 --> 01:10:06.444]  With Obama, it's over a million a night.
[01:10:06.965 --> 01:10:11.130]  So Prince Charles can have over 100 palaces, 20-something aircraft.
[01:10:12.321 --> 01:10:18.044]  And then lecture pensioners in England on not taking a hot bath or shower for their carbon footprint.
[01:10:18.344 --> 01:10:24.388]  It is the ultimate in hypocrisy while they have bodyguards saying we can't protect ourselves.
[01:10:24.408 --> 01:10:28.210]  And meanwhile, another dirtbag, another dirtbag government.
[01:10:29.628 --> 01:10:34.231]  North Korea to launch missiles tomorrow after warning foreigners to evacuate south.
[01:10:34.311 --> 01:10:37.053]  You know, the Founding Fathers said, keep government small or it will enslave you.
[01:10:37.753 --> 01:10:40.215]  Government's a dangerous servant, fearful master, like fire.
[01:10:40.855 --> 01:10:41.496]  Yeah, look at this.
[01:10:41.996 --> 01:10:49.301]  They can't even build an automobile, but they've got over 10,000 artillery pieces aimed at Seoul 30 miles away, threatening to blow it up tomorrow.
[01:10:49.521 --> 01:10:54.524]  They're loading A-bombs on top missiles, saying they'll nuke South Korea, Japan.
[01:10:54.564 --> 01:10:55.504]  They've got to actually worry.
[01:10:56.805 --> 01:10:57.726]  Over the West Coast.
[01:10:58.146 --> 01:10:58.907]  Again, what's the threat?
[01:10:59.047 --> 01:10:59.867]  Government.
[01:11:00.128 --> 01:11:04.010]  What killed 262 million people, non-military related, 20th century?
[01:11:04.090 --> 01:11:04.771]  Government.
[01:11:05.191 --> 01:11:06.072]  What do I worry about?
[01:11:06.112 --> 01:11:07.292]  What do the founders worry about?
[01:11:07.613 --> 01:11:08.393]  Government.
[01:11:08.513 --> 01:11:09.094]  Government.
[01:11:09.274 --> 01:11:14.137]  Who wants to make vaccinations mandatory and has already given them to kids without parental consent in multiple states?
[01:11:14.437 --> 01:11:14.938]  Government.
[01:11:15.678 --> 01:11:16.298]  Government!
[01:11:16.679 --> 01:11:17.199]  Government!
[01:11:17.419 --> 01:11:22.141]  Who takes 70 plus percent of the French people's money and now wants more, but is exempt from it.
[01:11:22.301 --> 01:11:26.424]  And the whole ruling class government, it turns out, don't pay taxes and have Swiss bank accounts.
[01:11:26.824 --> 01:11:27.504]  Government!
[01:11:29.325 --> 01:11:36.469]  Because government is the tool that big financial mafia interests come to to shut down their competition and get corporate welfare.
[01:11:38.350 --> 01:11:43.292]  That's why Bloomberg and all these foreign bankers want your guns and want unlimited funding.
[01:11:43.332 --> 01:11:44.833]  I want to say we're a democracy.
[01:11:45.947 --> 01:11:55.753]  Because they can say, hey, we'll give you a one-time $1,000 check if you get behind voting to get rid of the middle class and take all their money that's only a couple trillion dollars and give it to the government.
[01:11:56.153 --> 01:11:57.314]  Okay, give me $1,000.
[01:11:58.755 --> 01:12:02.917]  Sell your birthright for $1,000, and then you give the $2 trillion to foreign banks, which is nothing.
[01:12:02.937 --> 01:12:11.142]  They could have made the $2 trillion up out of thin air with fractional reserve banking and EXIM, Export-Import Bank.
[01:12:14.111 --> 01:12:21.156]  SDRs, but they want to get rid of the middle class once and for all because the middle class is informed enough to have their own business.
[01:12:21.316 --> 01:12:23.118]  They're informed enough to know how the world works.
[01:12:23.298 --> 01:12:26.240]  They're informed enough to plant the crops and bring the crops in.
[01:12:26.260 --> 01:12:27.160]  They're real people.
[01:12:27.381 --> 01:12:38.789]  They're not slovenly little spoiled brat punk kids sent to college to get a globalist corporate job or some government job to then lecture to us how dumb we are all day!
[01:12:41.544 --> 01:12:51.738]  Let me tell you, I talk to the average so-called liberal out there, and they think gun magazines, they think gun magazines are disposable.
[01:12:53.617 --> 01:12:56.639]  They don't know that gun crime is way down because of gun ownership going up.
[01:12:56.880 --> 01:12:58.361]  They don't know any of that.
[01:12:58.921 --> 01:12:59.662]  They're not liberals.
[01:12:59.862 --> 01:13:01.284]  They're authoritarian dupes.
[01:13:01.524 --> 01:13:05.167]  And the problem is the Republicans work for the very same people at the top.
[01:13:05.607 --> 01:13:07.329]  Because this is a global government.
[01:13:07.509 --> 01:13:09.271]  This is a global system of control.
[01:13:09.651 --> 01:13:13.514]  I want to play this newscast because they've been denying that this exists.
[01:13:14.449 --> 01:13:20.131]  Even though it's in Wired Magazine, AP Reuters, FAA funding a year ago to launch 30,000 drones.
[01:13:20.151 --> 01:13:28.013]  They're arresting people for environmental infractions, building a shed on their property they can't, with drones for years, manned aircraft as well.
[01:13:28.314 --> 01:13:30.094]  And remember, they say Alex Jones is a liar.
[01:13:30.334 --> 01:13:31.135]  There are no drones.
[01:13:31.475 --> 01:13:32.755]  There are no weaponized drones.
[01:13:32.775 --> 01:13:33.895]  There are no police drones.
[01:13:34.095 --> 01:13:36.616]  Because they don't want you to get politically involved to say no.
[01:13:37.136 --> 01:13:38.297]  They just, there are no bullets.
[01:13:38.797 --> 01:13:39.738]  There are no checkpoints.
[01:13:39.758 --> 01:13:42.641]  The TSA isn't sticking their hands down your pants, even though they are.
[01:13:43.161 --> 01:13:44.863]  Why do they lie, even when they get caught?
[01:13:44.903 --> 01:13:46.424]  The White House Press Secretary told us why.
[01:13:47.646 --> 01:13:55.373]  Because then, they could just put you in an Alice in Wonderland level, where even though you know they're lying, you can't ever get anywhere, because they just keep denying it.
[01:13:56.154 --> 01:13:57.075]  Because they're in control!
[01:13:57.095 --> 01:13:58.456]  Because they stole everything!
[01:14:00.078 --> 01:14:02.280]  They're not going to have a debate with you, because they can't!
[01:14:05.444 --> 01:14:08.205]  Oh, USA Today says disavow drone program, Gibbs.
[01:14:08.225 --> 01:14:12.986]  No, he was told to lie about something that was on record to exist.
[01:14:13.386 --> 01:14:14.686]  That's how dumb they think you are.
[01:14:14.946 --> 01:14:33.531]  So here is a Oklahoma newscast, short newscast, where Homeland Security and the governor's office are running drones that target people that have guns, and then we have the Homeland Security training video where it shows people selling someone a gun, American, you know, redneck guys with camo hats, out in the field.
[01:14:34.801 --> 01:14:36.502]  This is what Homeland Security's for.
[01:14:36.782 --> 01:14:38.203]  An authoritarian takeover.
[01:14:39.524 --> 01:14:40.464]  They've got it in place.
[01:14:40.885 --> 01:14:42.105]  They think they can take over.
[01:14:42.706 --> 01:14:44.807]  They'll probably stage some false flags to blame it on us.
[01:14:45.087 --> 01:14:46.308]  We're in a red-level crisis.
[01:14:46.628 --> 01:14:47.628]  Here's that newscast.
[01:14:48.289 --> 01:14:48.809]  How about this?
[01:14:48.909 --> 01:14:52.931]  A leaked government report reveals testing in Oklahoma of drones.
[01:14:53.472 --> 01:14:57.394]  Drones that have sensors that can find people and even tell if they're carrying a weapon.
[01:14:57.654 --> 01:15:01.675]  This is happening at a remote site now near the Lawton area at Fort Sill.
[01:15:01.695 --> 01:15:03.935]  News 9's Dana Hertnicki has the details here at 6.
[01:15:04.976 --> 01:15:13.418]  According to the report, the testing is taking place here at the Oklahoma Training Center for Unmanned Systems, operated by Oklahoma State University.
[01:15:13.938 --> 01:15:18.259]  The group doing the work is a, quote, trusted agent of the federal government.
[01:15:19.019 --> 01:15:31.910]  Located directly across from a cattle pasture in an unassuming house in the middle of Oklahoma, researchers are conducting some of the most cutting-edge and controversial testing of drone technology.
[01:15:32.530 --> 01:15:34.171]  It's advanced technology for sure.
[01:15:34.492 --> 01:15:39.436]  It's technology that we don't want any of our enemies to have.
[01:15:39.716 --> 01:15:42.158]  Tony Strickland does not work for the center, but
[01:15:43.473 --> 01:15:44.794]  That's psych warfare.
[01:15:44.834 --> 01:15:45.974]  We don't want our enemies to have.
[01:15:46.054 --> 01:15:47.535]  Our enemies took America over.
[01:15:47.855 --> 01:15:50.357]  They've got all our money building robot armies against us.
[01:15:53.318 --> 01:15:56.280]  And then they go, I'm going to play the rest of it the next hour after our guests leave.
[01:15:56.941 --> 01:16:00.102]  And then I'm going to get into just a bunch of other insane news.
[01:16:01.003 --> 01:16:05.765]  I've already played this to that Colorado Democrat, Diane Getty, saying
[01:16:07.008 --> 01:16:08.969]  You know, the clips are disposable.
[01:16:08.989 --> 01:16:09.969]  You can only use them once.
[01:16:10.229 --> 01:16:11.209]  That's why we've got to ban them.
[01:16:11.229 --> 01:16:13.490]  I mean, these people are just so out of control.
[01:16:14.970 --> 01:16:18.772]  And again, the kleptocrat criminals, they hate good people.
[01:16:19.032 --> 01:16:19.892]  They hate fathers.
[01:16:19.952 --> 01:16:20.732]  They hate families.
[01:16:20.772 --> 01:16:21.472]  They hate children.
[01:16:21.872 --> 01:16:24.213]  And that's why I have the White House Science Czar.
[01:16:24.793 --> 01:16:32.095]  I'll show it to you during the next segment if you're a TV viewer, radio listener, eco-science, where they said, we're going to use diet injections and junctions to dumb you down.
[01:16:32.115 --> 01:16:33.516]  We're going to put stuff in your water.
[01:16:34.710 --> 01:16:36.995]  Now they've got hundreds of shots they want to give kids.
[01:16:37.877 --> 01:16:44.710]  And if your kid has a convulsion after the shot, which the insurance says it can do, and has blood on the brain and dies, they're going to take you to jail.
[01:16:46.704 --> 01:16:51.507]  Now, joining us, ladies and gentlemen, are some very interesting people.
[01:16:51.727 --> 01:16:53.909]  Dan and Candy Spitz.
[01:16:54.569 --> 01:16:57.411]  And of course, I've been listening to Dan since I was about 11 years old.
[01:16:58.011 --> 01:17:07.117]  He's a three-time Grammy-nominated, multi-platinum recording artist, best known for his work with heavy metal band Anthrax, one of the founding members, and recently performing with Dave Mustaine in a group called Red Lamb.
[01:17:07.637 --> 01:17:14.045]  He is the first heavy metal artist to have his guitar played on Mars by NASA Mars Curiosity Rover.
[01:17:14.406 --> 01:17:19.932]  He is a Swiss certified master watchmaker, a mechanical complication specialist.
[01:17:19.953 --> 01:17:22.115]  Dan is the father of two identical boys.
[01:17:22.856 --> 01:17:27.740]  ...with autism and works with his wife, Candy, to speak out and to create awareness for the important issues.
[01:17:27.860 --> 01:17:30.602]  AutismSpeaks.org, DanSpitz.com.
[01:17:31.202 --> 01:17:32.903]  And this is a real warning.
[01:17:32.963 --> 01:17:37.487]  Obama wants to talk about 20 dead kids and try to collectively say it's our guilt, because it's the government.
[01:17:37.967 --> 01:17:40.888]  The victimization zone advertises a place for mass shooters.
[01:17:41.408 --> 01:17:52.852]  No, we have no guilt, but we do have guilt in letting them push deadly vaccines that they know are causing autoimmune responses on the brain and massive brain damage and also attacking the intestines with autoimmune disorders.
[01:17:52.892 --> 01:17:55.273]  And I've had top scientists, brain surgeons, you name it on.
[01:17:56.317 --> 01:18:02.002]  And we're going to break here in a few minutes, but Dan, thank you for coming on with Kandee today via video Skype.
[01:18:02.663 --> 01:18:06.966]  Just in a nutshell, your boys were already, you know, TV stars.
[01:18:06.986 --> 01:18:08.147]  They were already all over the place.
[01:18:08.167 --> 01:18:11.690]  They were already amazing, and then they got hit with the bioweapon.
[01:18:13.152 --> 01:18:14.012]  Dan, good to have you with us.
[01:18:14.898 --> 01:18:21.804]  Yeah, our children, Brendan and Jayden, who are now five, they're identical mirror image twins, which is the closest to conjoined.
[01:18:21.864 --> 01:18:23.305]  So they are from the same egg.
[01:18:24.025 --> 01:18:26.547]  And, you know, no fertility drugs or anything like that.
[01:18:26.627 --> 01:18:29.049]  Real old schools, you know, old school twins.
[01:18:29.149 --> 01:18:31.111]  And they were hitting every milestone.
[01:18:31.171 --> 01:18:33.973]  They were walking, talking, normal kids.
[01:18:34.053 --> 01:18:38.597]  And, you know, we're the parents who don't have to say, well, we have video
[01:18:38.677 --> 01:18:39.277]  We're good to go.
[01:18:55.023 --> 01:18:58.786]  So we have video proof from outsiders that, you know, they made eye contact.
[01:18:58.826 --> 01:19:01.368]  They took direction at very young ages.
[01:19:01.989 --> 01:19:06.533]  They could be touched by people other than us or just be touched in general and so on and so forth.
[01:19:06.553 --> 01:19:14.920]  So right down the line, you know, as normal as normal can be for identical twins and ahead of what normal identical twins would be.
[01:19:16.201 --> 01:19:20.704]  And then, of course, you know, we had the normal 12-month vaccines.
[01:19:21.525 --> 01:19:25.928]  Which I actually posted something on my personal Facebook just this week.
[01:19:26.589 --> 01:19:35.055]  If you take a look, in my era, they had, we got eight vaccines and now there's 38.
[01:19:35.315 --> 01:19:42.341]  So one of our children, Jaden, had a bad reaction to the shot and he was the one with the face and one with all the head that could speak.
[01:19:43.061 --> 01:19:43.881]  All right, stay there.
[01:19:43.901 --> 01:19:46.122]  We're going to come right back and start over.
[01:19:46.162 --> 01:19:47.542]  This is really important info.
[01:19:47.582 --> 01:19:48.003]  Get into that.
[01:19:48.023 --> 01:19:51.484]  And a lot of those shots have three or four or five or six things in them.
[01:19:51.964 --> 01:19:54.404]  Some numbers are over a hundred shots they're trying to give.
[01:19:54.424 --> 01:19:57.245]  And they've got new ones coming on every year they're trying to force.
[01:19:57.966 --> 01:19:59.126]  It's total engineering.
[01:19:59.146 --> 01:20:01.066]  We're the government, Bill and Melinda Gates.
[01:20:01.247 --> 01:20:02.547]  We're going to put this in your kid.
[01:20:03.127 --> 01:20:06.208]  And then, formally, they're the head of Planned Parenthood and the eugenics board.
[01:20:06.648 --> 01:20:08.829]  Yeah, it's not about keeping your kids safe, folks.
[01:20:10.345 --> 01:20:12.246]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[01:20:12.266 --> 01:20:14.187]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[01:20:14.427 --> 01:20:20.651]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[01:20:20.671 --> 01:20:23.873]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[01:20:24.133 --> 01:20:27.855]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[01:20:28.015 --> 01:20:29.196]  The fact is, you are.
[01:20:29.396 --> 01:20:30.176]  We all are.
[01:20:30.417 --> 01:20:32.738]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.

[01:21:26.619 --> 01:21:31.564]  Now, 27 years later, carnivore capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

[01:22:40.026 --> 01:22:44.408]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:22:44.588 --> 01:22:50.310]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold before your retirement.
[01:22:50.390 --> 01:22:53.771]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[01:24:22.137 --> 01:24:23.338]  Alright, this is a short segment.
[01:24:23.378 --> 01:24:24.478]  Alex Jones here back live.
[01:24:24.518 --> 01:24:25.539]  Long segment coming up.
[01:24:26.059 --> 01:24:29.620]  Dan and Candy Spitz are our guest right now.
[01:24:29.640 --> 01:24:33.862]  He's one of the founding members of Anthrax and a bunch of other big rock bands.
[01:24:33.882 --> 01:24:38.724]  I mean, I've been to concerts and actually watched him up on stage when I was a teenager.
[01:24:39.364 --> 01:24:43.126]  And one of our crew members' wife went into labor today having twins.
[01:24:44.687 --> 01:24:46.548]  In fact, I didn't ask if they're identical or fraternal.
[01:24:46.568 --> 01:24:48.128]  I don't think they know, or they didn't tell me.
[01:24:48.968 --> 01:25:05.534]  But, I mean, imagine, anybody that has children, the magic of your children, they're up, they're walking, they're talking, they get shots, the second round, the third round, and they're gone, and the insert says it can cause neurological disorders, but then they have a hoax, oh no, there's no connection, everything's fine.
[01:25:06.474 --> 01:25:16.623]  But, Dan and Kandi, Kandi there with you, I don't know how you can, I mean, I guess you fight back by speaking out, but I mean, what was it like for you when this happened?
[01:25:17.664 --> 01:25:23.949]  Well, let me, let me add, Kandi, who is the national spokesperson for Autism Speaks, kind of, kind of take it from here.
[01:25:24.009 --> 01:25:24.850]  Absolutely, go ahead.
[01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:28.741]  I said, we have two different viewpoints on the vaccines.
[01:25:29.081 --> 01:25:34.343]  And just like you're saying, when it first happened, we really attributed autism to the vaccines.
[01:25:34.883 --> 01:25:38.524]  Like Dan said, Jaden was jumping off the couch at eight months old.
[01:25:39.005 --> 01:25:40.465]  He had the vaccines at 12 months.
[01:25:40.505 --> 01:25:41.165]  It's the cocktail.
[01:25:41.205 --> 01:25:41.786]  It's the MMR.
[01:25:41.826 --> 01:25:44.607]  You're getting 37 shots in total, like four.
[01:25:46.826 --> 01:25:49.468]  We watched him, you know, resort to nothing.
[01:25:49.588 --> 01:25:51.869]  He was laying on a couch for five days straight.
[01:25:51.949 --> 01:25:52.470]  He didn't eat.
[01:25:52.570 --> 01:25:53.250]  He didn't sleep.
[01:25:53.350 --> 01:25:54.331]  He wouldn't go into his crib.
[01:25:54.351 --> 01:25:55.091]  He wouldn't do anything.
[01:25:55.671 --> 01:25:59.554]  But at the end of those five days, they did seem to come back to normal.
[01:26:00.414 --> 01:26:01.955]  So we were playing both sides of the field here.
[01:26:01.975 --> 01:26:04.457]  At one point, we're going, okay, we just gave them the autism shot.
[01:26:04.517 --> 01:26:05.357]  The word was out there.
[01:26:05.377 --> 01:26:06.518]  You know, there was no denying it.
[01:26:06.678 --> 01:26:06.978]  That was 2009.
[01:26:07.038 --> 01:26:10.521]  You know, there's no denying it was the autism shot.
[01:26:11.661 --> 01:26:15.704]  But after five days, they seemed to come back to normal and we kind of got our kids back.
[01:26:16.621 --> 01:26:18.722]  So for a while there, we didn't know anything else was wrong.
[01:26:18.862 --> 01:26:32.651]  We went through a period from age, say, 12 months to 17 months, where our kids were right back to working, playing, and doing all the things that they were doing, but they really weren't making the progress that they once did, where we did everything early.
[01:26:33.717 --> 01:26:37.458]  And then over a two-week window, we lost every skill that they have.
[01:26:37.898 --> 01:26:42.299]  They stopped walking, talking, playing, eating, eye contact.
[01:26:42.519 --> 01:26:44.420]  They would shriek if we touched them.
[01:26:46.100 --> 01:26:48.301]  They would, by the end of the two weeks, they would just rock.
[01:26:48.481 --> 01:26:52.902]  They would press this ball popper toy, like an air motor, and they would rock back and forth.
[01:26:53.182 --> 01:26:54.462]  You could wave your hands in front of them.
[01:26:54.482 --> 01:26:55.882]  You know, they were gone.
[01:26:56.402 --> 01:26:57.323]  There was nothing we can do.
[01:26:58.303 --> 01:27:02.224]  And that's when, you know, for both of us, you know, we realized something was wrong.
[01:27:03.237 --> 01:27:05.078]  But we didn't know it was autism at the time.
[01:27:05.439 --> 01:27:10.242]  You know, this is just four years ago, four and a half years ago, and the word still wasn't out there.
[01:27:10.262 --> 01:27:16.246]  There was a couple, you know, people, you know, in the press who are, you know, speaking of vaccines and autism, but the word wasn't there.
[01:27:17.187 --> 01:27:18.848]  So we're going, what happened to our perfect kids?
[01:27:19.889 --> 01:27:22.311]  And we reacted differently.
[01:27:22.964 --> 01:27:26.988]  You know, we took them right into the pediatrician, you know, right at 18 months and said, something's wrong.
[01:27:27.028 --> 01:27:31.252]  But your doctors are telling you, you know, Candy, you know, I've had them since birth.
[01:27:31.532 --> 01:27:32.694]  I've given them every shot.
[01:27:33.054 --> 01:27:38.559]  You know, there, you know, you know, factually, there's nothing that can be caused by the vaccines.
[01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:42.023]  And true, you know, the facts say no.
[01:27:42.861 --> 01:27:46.963]  But, as a mom, in your gut, you're saying, you know, something's wrong here.
[01:27:47.163 --> 01:27:52.345]  You know, I'm only 38 years old, and I did not get the same cocktail 38 years ago that my children are getting now.
[01:27:52.745 --> 01:27:54.665]  And every state's vaccines are different.
[01:27:55.226 --> 01:28:00.808]  So, in New York, where we were at the time, they were getting a lot more aggressive shots than, say, here in Florida, where we live now.
[01:28:01.881 --> 01:28:06.903]  And the more you start looking at this, our friends who are all doctors weren't giving their kids the shots.
[01:28:07.203 --> 01:28:09.003]  Or they would, but they would spread them out.
[01:28:09.023 --> 01:28:10.824]  For the 12 month shot, they would get one at 15 months.
[01:28:11.024 --> 01:28:17.386]  I was about to say, most of the doctors and nurses I know, their kids have had no shots now, but they're like, oh, you need to take it.
[01:28:17.626 --> 01:28:19.866]  So now they're trying to make medical staff take it as well.
[01:28:20.187 --> 01:28:21.267]  This is a real tyranny.
[01:28:21.673 --> 01:28:32.341]  Yeah, you know, we do all the studies now because it is in the public eye and I'm trying to be, you know, the first one speaking out in true metal form and the truth, you know, through music of all the studies that we are doing.
[01:28:32.361 --> 01:28:39.566]  You know, someone should really do a study and see how many doctors, how many of their cousins and their cousins' children are really getting the shots on time.
[01:28:41.530 --> 01:28:57.459]  But a big factor with autism and something we both try to draw attention to, and I don't know how much you're familiar with this, is a lot of what our children have gone through has been environmental, which goes along the same lines as the vaccines, but what's in our plastics, our foods, our pesticides, chemtrails in the air.
[01:28:58.936 --> 01:29:02.098]  That's where we saw the link for, you know, us as a family.
[01:29:02.118 --> 01:29:04.119]  We really think the vaccines might have been a trigger.
[01:29:04.339 --> 01:29:05.779]  Well, that's exactly where I was going.
[01:29:05.819 --> 01:29:08.601]  It's a binary weapons system from the documents we've got.
[01:29:09.161 --> 01:29:11.122]  And while you guys have really done your research, that's it.
[01:29:11.142 --> 01:29:14.363]  We were in a little bit with our kids with plastics.
[01:29:14.504 --> 01:29:16.184]  The BPA was not recalled until 2009.
[01:29:16.244 --> 01:29:18.225]  So, six months after the boys were diagnosed,
[01:29:21.767 --> 01:29:22.867]  They're, you know, they're bottles.
[01:29:22.887 --> 01:29:23.668]  They're pacifiers.
[01:29:23.748 --> 01:29:28.770]  Everything that they always used, and as children with autism do, they only use one certain set of tools.
[01:29:29.410 --> 01:29:30.890]  And they were all disappearing from the shelves.
[01:29:31.270 --> 01:29:32.711]  And I couldn't find why.
[01:29:32.731 --> 01:29:36.873]  And it was one of those, middle of the night, Danny and The Stain were out in California writing the album.
[01:29:36.893 --> 01:29:40.214]  You know, I'm up all night searching, like, where can I buy their bottles?
[01:29:40.794 --> 01:29:43.095]  And I see something about BPA.
[01:29:44.590 --> 01:29:48.452]  Hold on, I gotta hear this because, again, I'm familiar with your group.
[01:29:48.572 --> 01:29:49.592]  There's so much going on.
[01:29:49.752 --> 01:29:50.853]  I've separately learned this.
[01:29:50.893 --> 01:29:51.853]  You've separately learned it.
[01:29:52.193 --> 01:29:54.414]  It's an example of how the truth's hiding in plain view.
[01:29:54.834 --> 01:29:57.235]  The vaccines are the binary weapon trigger.
[01:29:57.475 --> 01:29:58.156]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:59.336 --> 01:30:00.236]  We're on the march.
[01:30:00.737 --> 01:30:02.337]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:03.258 --> 01:30:05.959]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:10.490 --> 01:30:11.511]  I had tried everything.
[01:30:11.551 --> 01:30:16.633]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating, I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[01:30:17.053 --> 01:30:21.535]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[01:30:21.875 --> 01:30:28.238]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[01:30:28.738 --> 01:30:39.225]  Now there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:30:39.945 --> 01:30:44.088]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[01:30:44.428 --> 01:30:50.472]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:30:50.692 --> 01:30:51.833]  Now that's results.
[01:30:52.233 --> 01:31:04.242]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to Infowarsteam.com and to order just three of their products and you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.

[01:31:10.686 --> 01:31:16.531]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our immunity and health.
[01:31:17.429 --> 01:31:23.313]  At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of silver-based products.
[01:31:24.174 --> 01:31:34.261]  Our most popular silver-based products are the 32-ounce Nano-Silver Solutions, our 2-ounce Nano-Silver Nasal Applicators, as well as our all-natural silver soaps.
[01:31:35.142 --> 01:31:38.445]  Just released is our 100% natural silver gel.
[01:31:39.265 --> 01:31:45.470]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.
[01:31:46.190 --> 01:31:56.619]  But rather, we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the silver more effectively.

[01:32:09.875 --> 01:32:11.797]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[01:32:11.837 --> 01:32:13.758]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[01:32:13.999 --> 01:32:19.483]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[01:32:19.703 --> 01:32:23.486]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[01:32:23.747 --> 01:32:27.530]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[01:32:27.690 --> 01:32:28.891]  The fact is, you are.
[01:32:29.071 --> 01:32:29.852]  We all are.
[01:32:30.092 --> 01:32:32.434]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[01:32:32.714 --> 01:32:41.082]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoods Direct.
[01:32:41.302 --> 01:32:42.503]  Be prepared before you need it.

[01:32:46.146 --> 01:32:48.408]  You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed you.

[01:33:00.878 --> 01:33:07.160]  Again, that number is 800-409-5633 or on the web at efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:33:07.400 --> 01:33:09.341]  You can bet your life on eFoods Direct.
[01:33:12.121 --> 01:33:17.663]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[01:33:18.123 --> 01:33:20.664]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:24.740 --> 01:33:32.087]  Dan and Candy Spitz join us, and they head up austinspeaks.org, danspitz.com.
[01:33:32.948 --> 01:33:36.191]  Of course, most people that listen to any type of music know who Dan is.
[01:33:37.112 --> 01:33:38.593]  And this freaks me out.
[01:33:38.613 --> 01:33:48.202]  I mean, this isn't like I'm coming to do my radio show, and I'm up here going, hey, let's talk about the weather, let's talk about, you know, how the local football team's doing.
[01:33:48.322 --> 01:33:49.823]  It totally freaks me out.
[01:33:50.748 --> 01:34:00.394]  That I've had countless medical doctors on, like Dr. Russell Blaylock, brain surgeon, who's in all the mainline medical literature discovering excitotoxins.
[01:34:01.735 --> 01:34:09.440]  They know aspartame in most candy, and now going into food unlabeled, is what alcohol and brain damage is due and is highly addictive.
[01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:16.684]  They know that for 50 plus years they've been putting silicone in the frying agents at most of the fast food places.
[01:34:16.784 --> 01:34:18.025]  I mean, just total kidney failure.
[01:34:19.086 --> 01:34:20.509]  And cancer rates are up over 3,000%.
[01:34:20.909 --> 01:34:22.131]  Pediatric over 10,000%.
[01:34:22.451 --> 01:34:24.975]  Autism was 1 in 30,000.
[01:34:25.075 --> 01:34:26.717]  It's 1 in 50-something.
[01:34:27.859 --> 01:34:30.122]  And I've done the research.
[01:34:30.182 --> 01:34:33.187]  It's all eugenicists that came up with the bisphenol A.
[01:34:35.697 --> 01:34:46.608]  In fact, if you want to go after right-wing groups that are controlled, the Koch brothers are heavily involved in distillates and bisphenol A. And they had all these other plastics they could have used, but they used the estrogen mimicker.
[01:34:47.068 --> 01:34:55.897]  And then you look at the pesticide, and you look at the sodium fluoride sprayed on the crops as a pesticide, and the fluoride in the water, and the Harvard studies on lowered IQ.
[01:34:57.198 --> 01:34:59.040]  And bone problems, increased cancer.
[01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:03.823]  I'll put some of this on screen for TV viewers, but radio listeners can just search everything I'm saying.
[01:35:04.423 --> 01:35:05.444]  And it's desperate!
[01:35:05.544 --> 01:35:18.893]  I mean, that's why I yell and scream, is because I look at my children, innocent, good, never had a shot, hardly any GMO, and I go watch other kids at sporting events and stuff, and I sit in restaurants.
[01:35:19.234 --> 01:35:20.655]  Kids look like zombies, man!
[01:35:21.295 --> 01:35:24.157]  And the physical IQ is dropped about 15 points
[01:35:25.718 --> 01:35:26.619]  The last 30 years.
[01:35:26.659 --> 01:35:27.379]  You can look that up.
[01:35:28.119 --> 01:35:29.180]  The kids are unhealthy.
[01:35:29.580 --> 01:35:30.620]  The parents are unhealthy.
[01:35:30.640 --> 01:35:31.561]  The fertility's down.
[01:35:31.621 --> 01:35:32.621]  The sperm count's down 87%.
[01:35:33.221 --> 01:35:36.383]  They are attacking us.
[01:35:36.443 --> 01:35:42.826]  And I'm going to shut up and go to our guest here, Dan Spitz and his wife, who does this full-time fighting.
[01:35:43.226 --> 01:35:47.348]  And you can go to AutismSpeaks.org and just see all the amazing work they're doing.
[01:35:48.008 --> 01:35:49.429]  And they're not mincing words.
[01:35:49.449 --> 01:35:50.449]  They're not playing games.
[01:35:50.489 --> 01:35:52.470]  But this is all a soft kill test.
[01:35:53.732 --> 01:36:04.959]  To just see, you know, can we give 100 million Americans conservatively with the polio vaccine the SV40 cancer virus that made rare cancers common?
[01:36:05.940 --> 01:36:09.583]  I mean, you know, we're not on the 20 dead kids at Sandy Hook that they're trying to hypoprotect our guns.
[01:36:09.863 --> 01:36:12.725]  We're talking about millions of people dying of cancer.
[01:36:12.745 --> 01:36:17.808]  100 plus million exposed and they're still giving the same vaccine today with the live virus in it.
[01:36:18.248 --> 01:36:22.271]  The UN's been caught sterilizing women with tetanus shots with a female hormone added.
[01:36:22.291 --> 01:36:23.332]  This isn't my opinion.
[01:36:24.292 --> 01:36:27.855]  And it didn't matter though, Costco Magazine says Bill and Melinda Gates love the children.
[01:36:28.336 --> 01:36:34.500]  So going back to Dan Spitz and also his wife Candy Spitz, you guys have got the floor.
[01:36:34.821 --> 01:36:39.624]  Tell us what you've learned, the cocktail, what happened with your boys, what you've learned since then.
[01:36:39.645 --> 01:36:44.168]  And now they're wanting to just push dozens and dozens of new vaccines a year on us.
[01:36:44.448 --> 01:36:46.070]  You got to take shots to go to college.
[01:36:47.451 --> 01:36:50.233]  The flu shot doesn't even protect you, doubles your chances of getting it.
[01:36:50.453 --> 01:36:51.394]  This is all facts.
[01:36:51.474 --> 01:36:52.274]  It's such a hoax.
[01:36:53.335 --> 01:36:54.476]  How bad does it have to get?
[01:36:55.457 --> 01:37:08.105]  Well, you know, I'll give it to Candy again because when she found out about the BPA, and I remember this was just years ago when no one knew, you know, she's like freaking out on me, telling me, you know, our children have really regressed.
[01:37:08.125 --> 01:37:10.027]  So she'll tell you what happened from there.
[01:37:10.572 --> 01:37:18.476]  Well, like you were saying, the scary part is you can go out of your way as a parent, as a mom, you're carrying this child for nine months to make sure that you did everything right.
[01:37:19.077 --> 01:37:21.358]  I knew all I did was eat, sleep, and work out.
[01:37:21.718 --> 01:37:24.740]  I ate all organic, bottled water and spinach all day.
[01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:30.263]  But then to learn that I really had no control because in those plastic bottles of water was BPA.
[01:37:30.823 --> 01:37:34.325]  There was pesticide on my spinach that I ate five meals a day.
[01:37:35.686 --> 01:37:41.508]  And it was right in my face when I said in 2009, my kids were 6 months diagnosed with autism.
[01:37:42.228 --> 01:37:47.029]  And BPA is now a voluntary recall, which means they didn't have to announce it to anybody.
[01:37:47.510 --> 01:37:49.250]  Baby bottles just came off the shelves.
[01:37:49.590 --> 01:37:51.751]  Bowls, pacifiers, everything just came off the shelves.
[01:37:53.194 --> 01:37:53.775]  I panicked.
[01:37:53.935 --> 01:37:57.900]  You know, I went through the pantry and everything had code 7 on it, which was a BPA.
[01:37:58.040 --> 01:37:58.501]  She freaked.
[01:37:58.521 --> 01:37:59.161]  Yeah, I freaked.
[01:37:59.222 --> 01:38:00.703]  I called Danny and Miss Stain in California.
[01:38:00.763 --> 01:38:05.810]  I'm like, if I heat this bottle up in the microwave, we've been doing this whole time, you know, this is going to slow down.
[01:38:06.190 --> 01:38:08.313]  This is why they're not talking, and so on and so forth.
[01:38:08.749 --> 01:38:09.449]  And that's what happened.
[01:38:09.629 --> 01:38:11.450]  I, you know, I said I threw out everything in the pantry.
[01:38:11.470 --> 01:38:22.216]  I called one of the boys' therapists, whose husband was a physician, and said, Oh my God, not only did I give them the vaccines that cause autism, now I've been poisoning my children, you know, for two years with plastic.
[01:38:22.816 --> 01:38:25.978]  And threw out everything in the house, went a little berserk as a mom.
[01:38:26.598 --> 01:38:32.061]  And within two days of removing all plastics from the house, they made sounds for the first time.
[01:38:32.081 --> 01:38:35.263]  They hadn't talked since they regressed at 18 months.
[01:38:35.583 --> 01:38:35.803]  I think so.
[01:38:54.305 --> 01:38:56.006]  It opened up that barrier again in the brain.
[01:38:56.286 --> 01:39:00.147]  But you don't know what damage has been caused by two years worth of plastic.
[01:39:00.287 --> 01:39:04.948]  And if plastic was causing it, you don't know what household cleaners were doing and pesticides in the grass.
[01:39:05.028 --> 01:39:11.670]  The cumulative effect, as you said earlier, of all of these factors above that past generations didn't have.
[01:39:12.944 --> 01:39:13.845]  But it's all out of our hands.
[01:39:14.145 --> 01:39:15.526]  There's nothing you can do at that point.
[01:39:15.626 --> 01:39:19.449]  And for us, that's when I became this big advocate for Autism Speaks.
[01:39:19.529 --> 01:39:25.073]  And my role really changed because there's nothing I can do to stop the fact that my children have autism.
[01:39:25.473 --> 01:39:26.234]  There is no cure.
[01:39:26.314 --> 01:39:28.676]  I don't care what anyone wants to hype out there.
[01:39:28.876 --> 01:39:30.357]  There is no cure for autism.
[01:39:30.457 --> 01:39:32.118]  You can correct behaviors.
[01:39:32.198 --> 01:39:33.659]  You can work around this.
[01:39:33.880 --> 01:39:35.321]  And your children really can flourish.
[01:39:35.401 --> 01:39:36.582]  Our kids are doing amazing.
[01:39:37.242 --> 01:39:38.243]  But you can't cure it.
[01:39:38.903 --> 01:39:42.746]  And, you know, I leave it up to my incredible team at Autism Speaks.
[01:39:43.046 --> 01:39:43.686]  That's what they're for.
[01:39:43.886 --> 01:39:46.488]  They're there to find out the hows, the why this happens.
[01:39:46.508 --> 01:39:49.130]  You know, what we can do to prevent it for future generations.
[01:39:49.450 --> 01:39:52.352]  But for right now, the whole face of society has changed.
[01:39:52.592 --> 01:39:55.834]  In 20 years, everybody you know will have something.
[01:39:55.954 --> 01:39:58.996]  You know, ADD, ADHD, OCD, autism.
[01:39:59.036 --> 01:40:01.098]  There's going to be some kind of neurological effect.
[01:40:01.778 --> 01:40:03.519]  And something is causing it.
[01:40:03.699 --> 01:40:05.139]  This was not naturally happening.
[01:40:05.579 --> 01:40:07.600]  You know, a new government report now shows 1 in 50.
[01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:09.801]  It's not the true number for autism yet.
[01:40:10.201 --> 01:40:11.261]  It's just a government study.
[01:40:11.521 --> 01:40:14.422]  But 1 in 50 school children now has autism.
[01:40:14.722 --> 01:40:17.003]  A million school children just in the United States.
[01:40:17.830 --> 01:40:21.694]  And that's scary, because what are we going to be, you know, in 20 years?
[01:40:21.974 --> 01:40:22.975]  This is your government leader.
[01:40:23.015 --> 01:40:30.002]  What are we going to do with everybody is the reason that I've returned to music full time and helping to spread the truth and the awareness.
[01:40:30.542 --> 01:40:34.806]  The only way I know how, and that's through what I do, and that's, you know, heavy metal, and that's telling the truth.
[01:40:34.946 --> 01:40:36.227]  And that's what Candy does.
[01:40:36.247 --> 01:40:41.693]  We're just here to let people into our lives and really hear the truth of what's going on.
[01:40:43.641 --> 01:40:45.862]  I want to talk about John P. Holdren's book.
[01:40:45.882 --> 01:40:47.622]  You know, he's the White House science czar.
[01:40:47.722 --> 01:40:53.383]  In this book, they talk about putting chemicals in the food and water to lower the IQ, to make us more easily managed.
[01:40:53.804 --> 01:40:56.364]  They talk about sterilizing us through stuff in the water.
[01:40:56.384 --> 01:41:00.785]  And then, of course, we have State Department Miranda 200, where they actually did all of this.
[01:41:00.845 --> 01:41:03.526]  I just want you to know, this was all done on purpose.
[01:41:03.966 --> 01:41:07.447]  And I want to warn everybody out there, the people running things are very, very wicked.
[01:41:08.618 --> 01:41:09.599]  I've actually heard that.
[01:41:09.619 --> 01:41:10.719]  I haven't read the book.
[01:41:10.999 --> 01:41:11.620]  I have heard that.
[01:41:12.780 --> 01:41:20.044]  The problem where it conflicts with autism is most children or anyone on the spectrum itself actually has very high IQs.
[01:41:20.084 --> 01:41:21.645]  We have higher than normal IQs.
[01:41:22.065 --> 01:41:24.907]  And so they can do things that regular children cannot do.
[01:41:25.327 --> 01:41:28.729]  So unfortunately that theory does not play into autism.
[01:41:29.309 --> 01:41:31.270]  It does into a lot of the other neurological disorders.
[01:41:31.450 --> 01:41:31.910]  Well, sure.
[01:41:31.930 --> 01:41:48.716]  I mean, it's meant to dumb the general public down, and then some people, it can create almost an idiot savant effect, and of course, you know, sometimes when the brain is attacked early on, it can regenerate or start new pathways, and might actually create, you know, supermen in some case, because that's how life works.
[01:41:48.736 --> 01:41:53.818]  You start poisoning bugs, and within a couple generations, they become immune and become even more powerful.
[01:41:55.423 --> 01:41:58.304]  Extreme highs and extreme lows in our own children.
[01:41:58.324 --> 01:42:01.667]  They can run multiple iPads at the same time doing things.
[01:42:02.647 --> 01:42:04.789]  At two years old, they said they wouldn't talk.
[01:42:05.049 --> 01:42:11.893]  We had a speech pathologist with us in our home who had been doing it for 21 years, dealing with children on the spectrum.
[01:42:12.554 --> 01:42:14.315]  And she almost basically gave up.
[01:42:14.435 --> 01:42:20.459]  And we turned around and one of our children reached in her handbag, grabbed her iPhone, cracked her code, and started moving all her apps around.
[01:42:21.493 --> 01:42:23.914]  But they were reading at two years old, but they couldn't speak.
[01:42:24.134 --> 01:42:27.136]  You know, now they're almost six years old and they can't feed themselves.
[01:42:27.576 --> 01:42:28.756]  You know, they're still in diapers.
[01:42:29.217 --> 01:42:30.337]  So you get highs and lows.
[01:42:30.537 --> 01:42:32.118]  They are brilliant.
[01:42:32.338 --> 01:42:34.059]  They can play piano by ear.
[01:42:34.799 --> 01:42:35.540]  Never had a lesson.
[01:42:35.740 --> 01:42:36.980]  You know, they're standing with guitar.
[01:42:37.040 --> 01:42:38.281]  They picked up most instruments.
[01:42:39.421 --> 01:42:43.903]  They can sing any song through repetition, but yet they can't have a conversation with you.
[01:42:43.944 --> 01:42:46.165]  And they speak on the level of, say, a 16 to 18 month old.
[01:42:47.325 --> 01:42:52.427]  So there's extreme highs and extreme lows, and every child with autism is different.
[01:42:52.987 --> 01:42:56.648]  Even though our kids are mirror image twins, they're actually one child split in two.
[01:42:57.028 --> 01:43:01.489]  Their autism is the farthest from, you know, from the same.
[01:43:01.569 --> 01:43:02.810]  It's two different kids.
[01:43:02.890 --> 01:43:05.351]  That's what was baffling a lot early on.
[01:43:05.531 --> 01:43:11.112]  The therapists that would visit our house, they were almost like a study case because they realized, wait a minute, it is the same egg.
[01:43:11.172 --> 01:43:13.193]  How come it didn't affect them exactly the same?
[01:43:15.134 --> 01:43:16.615]  Well, it's very, very frustrating.
[01:43:16.655 --> 01:43:41.456]  What we know is this, and that's a great point that Candy was starting to allude to, is that when the public found out about bisphenol A, and oh, there were all these studies proving that it was an estrogen mammacher, there was no debate, and of course they'd done it on purpose worldwide, I even have stuff where they bragged about it in the 70s, how they would do it, and causes all these neurological problems, they quietly withdrew it.
[01:43:42.356 --> 01:43:44.918]  But it's kind of like, okay, aspartame causes brain damage.
[01:43:45.218 --> 01:43:49.722]  Their answer is to get regulations passed where they don't call it aspartame and they put it in everything.
[01:43:50.182 --> 01:43:58.228]  I mean, this is, the globalists say the world is overpopulated, and whether it is or isn't, people should know, because a lot of yuppies go, well there are too many people.
[01:43:58.628 --> 01:44:00.830]  Alright, so the UN got caught sterilizing people.
[01:44:01.230 --> 01:44:09.016]  The point is they're doing it to us, and it's also very inhumane if you're going to sterilize people or try to brain damage them,
[01:44:09.696 --> 01:44:12.640]  To like just soft kill the public.
[01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:15.485]  It'd be nicer to just, you know, nerve gas everybody.
[01:44:15.505 --> 01:44:18.849]  I mean, the way they do it is just so cold-blooded.
[01:44:19.050 --> 01:44:21.934]  And then they want to sit here and play games like they're not doing it.
[01:44:21.994 --> 01:44:23.877]  Like Bill and Melinda Gates weren't on...
[01:44:24.818 --> 01:44:27.519]  With his dad, the board of Planned Parenthood, that they're not eugenicists.
[01:44:27.779 --> 01:44:28.660]  I have it all on record.
[01:44:28.900 --> 01:44:32.021]  That IBM wasn't started by a eugenicist who made the machines for the Nazis.
[01:44:32.101 --> 01:44:33.522]  You know, the Hollerith machines.
[01:44:33.542 --> 01:44:34.702]  I mean, I know the whole history.
[01:44:35.062 --> 01:44:35.823]  I know who they are.
[01:44:35.903 --> 01:44:36.743]  I know their plan.
[01:44:37.163 --> 01:44:38.924]  I know they're jacking the daylights out of us.
[01:44:39.725 --> 01:44:42.406]  Monsanto will not have any of the food.
[01:44:43.326 --> 01:44:44.926]  At their facilities that's GMO.
[01:44:45.167 --> 01:44:47.127]  Their scientists demand non-GMO.
[01:44:47.167 --> 01:44:48.608]  That's ten-year-old news.
[01:44:48.868 --> 01:44:52.869]  The communist Chinese, same deal, have secret greenhouses for their food.
[01:44:52.909 --> 01:44:59.951]  The elite is all obsessed with this, while they're giving it all to us, and it's like a psycho thriller movie, but we're living in it.
[01:45:00.411 --> 01:45:07.633]  And literally, I've got over a hundred books at this office, where they all just admit what they're doing to us, and that's what's so frustrating.
[01:45:08.713 --> 01:45:15.177]  But bottom line, they took the bisphenol A off the shelves in most places, but they're not taking the shots off.
[01:45:15.418 --> 01:45:16.999]  They're doubling and tripling down.
[01:45:17.439 --> 01:45:19.901]  Have you seen the newscast where they say mercury is good for your brain?
[01:45:20.777 --> 01:45:21.798]  No, no, no.
[01:45:23.479 --> 01:45:24.800]  We'll cue that up.
[01:45:24.820 --> 01:45:33.526]  What's the rush at 12 months to, you know, you have to do this, you have to do that, and that's what they're being told, and we're all being told, and it's almost like we're brainwashed.
[01:45:33.567 --> 01:45:34.747]  No, you can't, you can't do this.
[01:45:34.787 --> 01:45:36.509]  You can't get into kindergarten if you don't get that.
[01:45:36.909 --> 01:45:37.369]  You know what?
[01:45:37.409 --> 01:45:38.810]  Spread it out a little bit more.
[01:45:38.991 --> 01:45:41.412]  And, you know, that's what the doctors are doing to their children.
[01:45:41.432 --> 01:45:41.893]  They're waiting.
[01:45:41.953 --> 01:45:48.978]  If they see their child is a boy or it's a nervous system is developing a little slower, spread it out a little bit more.
[01:45:49.338 --> 01:45:53.200]  If they're gonna push 38 vaccines into you, spread it out.
[01:45:53.580 --> 01:45:57.021]  But they also don't tell you that you don't necessarily say, you know, our kids have the MMR.
[01:45:57.061 --> 01:45:58.262]  Everybody does it in 12 months.
[01:45:58.302 --> 01:46:05.044]  You get this big cocktail at 12 months old and you have to have it again at 5 for the school district and you have to have it again and say like 12 years old or something.
[01:46:05.545 --> 01:46:08.926]  You really don't physically need to have that shot again.
[01:46:09.466 --> 01:46:11.247]  You can be tested, which our kids were this year.
[01:46:11.267 --> 01:46:13.169]  Thank goodness they have an incredible pediatrician.
[01:46:13.189 --> 01:46:14.030]  We couldn't believe it.
[01:46:14.090 --> 01:46:25.678]  Where, you know, the schools are telling us, even though our kids do go to a special charter school just for autism, and we do get away with a lot of things that we don't necessarily would get away with in the public school system, but they were still telling us, you know, it's time for your five-year-old shots.
[01:46:26.059 --> 01:46:28.060]  And we went in, the pediatrician said, absolutely not.
[01:46:28.160 --> 01:46:34.005]  She goes, let me test their blood, because if they're still immune to all of these things, why on earth do we need to give them the shots again?
[01:46:34.145 --> 01:46:37.948]  There's no reason just because the schedule says, I have to pump you full of more medicine.
[01:46:38.208 --> 01:46:42.973]  Well, we went the first time that the shot wasn't there and it wasn't enough for them.
[01:46:43.113 --> 01:46:43.574]  Yeah, it was.
[01:46:43.754 --> 01:46:47.117]  There was a lot of things leading up to it, but clearly we were not supposed to get that shot.
[01:46:47.137 --> 01:46:48.499]  We were shaken to get this shot.
[01:46:48.519 --> 01:46:50.461]  I mean, as you could well imagine.
[01:46:50.721 --> 01:46:57.588]  And she did say, hey, wait a minute, you know, we can test, you know, Brendan and Jayden and they might have a natural immunity to these vaccines.
[01:46:57.709 --> 01:46:58.269]  And guess what?
[01:46:58.429 --> 01:46:58.730]  They did.
[01:47:00.029 --> 01:47:01.210]  Well you know what else is amazing?
[01:47:01.270 --> 01:47:04.071]  They lie and say it's the law to take shots when it's not.
[01:47:04.111 --> 01:47:12.796]  It's a state health department policy and then they tell you to get a waiver and act like it's the law but they won't tell most parents that there's even a waiver.
[01:47:13.216 --> 01:47:16.038]  This is so cold-blooded and I had a state attorney on.
[01:47:17.199 --> 01:47:20.080]  From Maryland, when they were making kids take shots a few years ago.
[01:47:20.400 --> 01:47:22.180]  And he admitted, oh I don't give my kids shots.
[01:47:23.421 --> 01:47:26.242]  But he told them it was the law to take the shots.
[01:47:26.302 --> 01:47:27.402]  I mean, it's just like, man.
[01:47:27.542 --> 01:47:28.002]  Yeah.
[01:47:29.202 --> 01:47:34.344]  That's why I said, you know, do the study on the doctors and their cousins and see when they're getting their kids shots.
[01:47:35.009 --> 01:47:42.372]  But that's what those organizations are now, like Autism Speaks, that are out there giving you... They're not going to give you one viewpoint and say, yes, it's vaccines, yes, it's genetic, yes, it's this.
[01:47:42.452 --> 01:47:46.053]  They're kind of showing you everything that's out there and not guiding you.
[01:47:46.073 --> 01:47:51.876]  This way, you as a parent, or you as an educator, you as society, have the chance to look into this for yourselves.
[01:47:52.176 --> 01:47:53.896]  You know, do I want my child to have shots?
[01:47:53.956 --> 01:47:55.077]  I don't want my child to have shots.
[01:47:55.117 --> 01:47:56.357]  Do I want to do a special diet?
[01:47:56.377 --> 01:47:57.258]  Does it have any effect?
[01:47:58.038 --> 01:48:01.802]  You as the parent really need to be looking into this for your own child.
[01:48:02.202 --> 01:48:05.405]  I'm not going to trust any government official, you know, any teacher there.
[01:48:05.485 --> 01:48:09.148]  I'm not going to trust anybody with making the best decisions for my children.
[01:48:09.709 --> 01:48:11.611]  So the information needs to be out there.
[01:48:11.811 --> 01:48:16.595]  And it really wasn't out there four and a half years ago when we started this, but it's all out there now.
[01:48:16.875 --> 01:48:19.738]  And that's what we try to guide everybody to Autism Speaks website.
[01:48:20.179 --> 01:48:21.542]  Because you can have just a question.
[01:48:21.562 --> 01:48:24.388]  You know, it's not saying you have to go donate to this organization.
[01:48:24.469 --> 01:48:26.373]  I don't even care if you believe in this organization.
[01:48:26.674 --> 01:48:29.179]  Even though I'm the spokesperson, I get both sides of the coin.
[01:48:29.987 --> 01:48:32.148]  Well, I have parents call me all the time.
[01:48:32.188 --> 01:48:37.249]  I mean, if I opened the phones up, we'd have countless parents where their children were fine, got the shot, had a convulsion.
[01:48:37.549 --> 01:48:42.811]  Parents will call and have had their kids taken after the shot makes them have a convulsion because you must have beaten your child.
[01:48:43.031 --> 01:48:46.652]  There's blood on the brain when the insert, you know, admitted that it caused that.
[01:48:47.032 --> 01:48:48.533]  They know full well what they're doing.
[01:48:49.193 --> 01:48:49.733]  It's a cult.
[01:48:50.173 --> 01:48:51.934]  It's human sacrifice of our children.
[01:48:52.934 --> 01:48:56.956]  But here's a video, MSNBC host, Your Kids Belong to the Collective.
[01:48:56.976 --> 01:49:12.023]  This is an ad they're running where Melissa Harris Perry says that now we've got to get past the private idea that your kids belong to you, but they don't mean help kids in the community, they mean the community's coming like California where they give shots to kids without parental consent.
[01:49:12.363 --> 01:49:13.464]  These people are very creepy.
[01:49:13.504 --> 01:49:13.984]  Here's the clip.
[01:49:15.345 --> 01:49:21.810]  We have never invested as much in public education as we should have because we've always had kind of a private notion of children.
[01:49:21.950 --> 01:49:25.192]  Your kid is yours and totally your responsibility.
[01:49:25.512 --> 01:49:28.755]  We haven't had a very collective notion of these are our children.
[01:49:29.015 --> 01:49:36.921]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[01:49:37.321 --> 01:49:42.325]  Once it's everybody's responsibility and not just the households, then we start making better investments.
[01:49:44.076 --> 01:49:49.689]  Yeah, now that we're collective eyes, we've all got to have our decisions taken over by the top brain bugs because they know best.
[01:49:50.050 --> 01:49:52.736]  Guys, what's your take on that statement you just heard?
[01:49:54.156 --> 01:50:07.641]  Uh, you know, what I'm trying to do is Candy does what she does and I do what I do with my new band Red Lamb, which is the collaborative with me and Davis, just to bring that awareness that we are in a new generation, we need to move forward.
[01:50:07.781 --> 01:50:19.726]  If you do see signs, you know, after your child has his shots or so on and so forth, that something's wrong or if you have twins, that we can't listen to our past generations, our grandmothers or our great-grandmothers who are still around going,
[01:50:20.126 --> 01:50:22.587]  You know, wait a little while, you know, he might be alright.
[01:50:22.767 --> 01:50:25.508]  You know, you didn't talk till you were three and so on and so forth.
[01:50:25.989 --> 01:50:33.272]  We have to think for ourselves and act fast to get to the problem swiftly and when the mind is pliable at a very young age.
[01:50:33.472 --> 01:50:39.375]  As we did and we were blessed with when Candy stumbled on the Autism Speak site and we were able to get our information.
[01:50:39.775 --> 01:50:46.318]  So that's what I'm doing in music and it's about time somebody did it in music because it's pretty much everywhere else in all the other arts fields.
[01:50:46.658 --> 01:50:48.639]  Yeah, well I just want people to know, this is personal.
[01:50:48.719 --> 01:50:50.040]  They're doing this on purpose.
[01:50:50.760 --> 01:50:51.741]  So just remember that.
[01:50:52.121 --> 01:50:55.363]  And the collaborator doctors, nurses, most of them don't take the shots.
[01:50:55.883 --> 01:50:57.043]  They all know what's going on.
[01:50:57.083 --> 01:50:58.524]  It's all, it's a joke to them.
[01:50:59.485 --> 01:51:03.107]  And I know that's hard to believe, but look at Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia.
[01:51:03.407 --> 01:51:04.587]  This is what collectivists do.
[01:51:05.128 --> 01:51:06.568]  They are a bunch of scum.
[01:51:07.429 --> 01:51:09.310]  And by the way, I have the clip of them saying Mercury's good.
[01:51:10.612 --> 01:51:13.634]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms.
[01:51:13.994 --> 01:51:19.418]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[01:51:20.018 --> 01:51:23.200]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?
[01:51:23.881 --> 01:51:25.121]  Check out SimpliSafe.

[01:52:10.836 --> 01:52:16.238]  Imagine waking one morning only to find your family shivering in the dark because you couldn't afford to pay your electric bill.
[01:52:16.838 --> 01:52:17.939]  That's closer than you think.
[01:52:18.659 --> 01:52:24.481]  You probably haven't heard about this yet because the liberal media has been suppressing what has fast become the most shocking news story of 2012.
[01:52:24.841 --> 01:52:32.784]  Obama's secret war on coal that could increase your already high power bill as much as 400% in coming months.
[01:52:33.585 --> 01:52:39.127]  As shocking as it sounds, it may well be just a matter of time before the lights start going out across America.
[01:52:39.867 --> 01:52:40.888]  But here's some good news.
[01:52:41.248 --> 01:52:50.095]  There's an underground video at exposed123.com that thousands of smart patriots have used to end their slavery to the corrupt electricity monopoly.
[01:52:50.736 --> 01:52:59.543]  The video at exposed123.com has already been banned by Google, and the liberal media is doing everything in its power to take it down and keep America in the dark.
[01:53:00.003 --> 01:53:04.046]  So watch it now at exposed123.com before it's too late.
[01:53:04.206 --> 01:53:05.708]  Again, that's exposed123.com.
[01:53:08.766 --> 01:53:13.767]  We travel so much, and having a fake TV, well, it gives added peace of mind.
[01:53:13.927 --> 01:53:17.048]  Burglars look for houses that appear to be easy targets.
[01:53:17.428 --> 01:53:23.429]  But fake TV can fool even professional burglars into thinking someone is home watching television.
[01:53:23.549 --> 01:53:35.491]  As a recent widow living alone, it gives me great peace of mind to set my fake TV near a window and know that passing motorists and pedestrians will think someone is home watching TV when I'm actually away from home.
[01:53:35.811 --> 01:53:40.173]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet just like a light on a timer.
[01:53:40.373 --> 01:53:41.934]  And they're so easy to use.
[01:53:42.174 --> 01:53:44.075]  You just plug them in and they're ready to go.
[01:53:44.375 --> 01:53:47.817]  Plus, they're so affordable that we have one upstairs and downstairs.
[01:53:48.077 --> 01:53:49.938]  Fake TV is only $29.95 with free shipping.
[01:53:51.619 --> 01:53:56.000]  Order your fake TV by calling 877-5-FAKE-TV.
[01:53:56.300 --> 01:53:58.321]  Or go to FAKETV.com.
[01:53:58.581 --> 01:54:00.801]  That's 877-532-5388.
[01:54:02.862 --> 01:54:04.762]  Or FAKETV.com.
[01:54:05.102 --> 01:54:06.023]  FAKETV.
[01:54:06.303 --> 01:54:07.623]  The Burglar Deterrent.
[01:54:11.424 --> 01:54:16.585]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:17.245 --> 01:54:19.526]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:54:21.221 --> 01:54:27.426]  There are thousands of studies out there with vaccines damaging people, but they never get media attention.
[01:54:28.687 --> 01:54:37.114]  But then they'll have Journal of Pediatrics government-funded studies saying, hey, first they said there's not mercury, even though there was, and they said, okay, we took it out when they didn't.
[01:54:38.715 --> 01:54:39.676]  Then they changed their story.
[01:54:39.696 --> 01:54:40.917]  This is eight years ago.
[01:54:41.738 --> 01:54:44.140]  This was on CBS News all over the country.
[01:54:44.160 --> 01:54:45.521]  This was the Austin version of it.
[01:54:46.001 --> 01:54:49.704]  But CBS Nightly News came out, and just last year they said this again.
[01:54:50.225 --> 01:54:56.570]  Actually, mercury-containing vaccines increase your child's performance and behavior.
[01:54:57.210 --> 01:54:58.031]  See, that's Orwellian.
[01:54:58.051 --> 01:54:59.733]  They mean a vegetable to do whatever they're told.
[01:55:00.633 --> 01:55:02.975]  You know, just like they won't hire cops with over 100 IQ now.
[01:55:02.996 --> 01:55:10.563]  I mean, this is a hive system where the big brain bugs are up on top, we're down here on the bottom.
[01:55:11.744 --> 01:55:16.789]  And, you know, if they can't, I mean, you know, they didn't let slaves learn how to read and write in any culture.
[01:55:17.309 --> 01:55:18.790]  Roman slaves, black slaves.
[01:55:19.291 --> 01:55:21.013]  I mean, well, here, we're just going to brain damage you.
[01:55:21.755 --> 01:55:22.295]  How's that sound?
[01:55:22.836 --> 01:55:25.318]  Here they are saying mercury is good for your brain.
[01:55:25.538 --> 01:55:30.962]  Not only do you not, your children belong to the state, and parents are bad, but mercury is good for your brain.
[01:55:31.243 --> 01:55:32.504]  Here is Austin Kayi.
[01:55:33.524 --> 01:55:35.966]  Mercury-containing vaccines may have on kids.
[01:55:36.206 --> 01:55:39.509]  A life-saving device wins over-the-counter approval by the FDA.
[01:55:39.829 --> 01:55:41.871]  And sick of your glasses and contact lenses?
[01:55:41.951 --> 01:55:44.613]  A new corrective eye surgery is approved today.
[01:55:44.633 --> 01:55:48.096]  Here's tonight's medical headlines with medical watch reporter Seema Mathur.
[01:55:50.672 --> 01:55:56.835]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[01:55:57.155 --> 01:56:03.558]  There have been widespread concerns that mercury-based preservatives and vaccines might impair the neurological development of children.
[01:56:03.578 --> 01:56:10.942]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[01:56:11.242 --> 01:56:18.065]  All right, let me, because I know that sounded crazy, Dan, and candy spits when I said that, but so I thought you might want to hear that.
[01:56:18.685 --> 01:56:19.186]  Pretty amazing.
[01:56:19.206 --> 01:56:19.786]  What do you think of that?
[01:56:20.186 --> 01:56:31.915]  It's not as crazy as what I just heard a few weeks ago being I am the co-founder of the band Anthrax that they have a vaccine now being tested or slightly or approved or whatever it is that they're putting Anthrax in your buddies.
[01:56:32.796 --> 01:56:35.558]  By the way, which as you know, they want to give it to little kids now.
[01:56:36.379 --> 01:56:39.482]  They had to suspend three times giving it to troops that killed so many people.
[01:56:39.922 --> 01:56:40.963]  Sure, why not, right?
[01:56:41.974 --> 01:56:49.678]  Well, hell, I mean, if your child has a convulsion, they'll just... I'm sure you know that the shaken baby thing, they did studies in Australia, it was really the shots.
[01:56:49.718 --> 01:56:52.739]  They put monitors on them, but they never want that info out here.
[01:56:52.980 --> 01:56:56.882]  Not only do they kill your kid, or hurt him, then they get to put you in jail.
[01:56:56.962 --> 01:56:57.742]  It's even better!
[01:56:59.503 --> 01:57:08.568]  Yeah, well, you know, because it costs, what, $3 to $5.4 million per child who's on the autism spectrum to raise them, just to an early age.
[01:57:08.608 --> 01:57:09.008]  We have two.
[01:57:10.698 --> 01:57:12.359]  Oh yeah, that's some cashola!
[01:57:13.459 --> 01:57:13.719]  Uh-huh.
[01:57:14.059 --> 01:57:15.599]  Well, that's the reason no one's ever going to.
[01:57:15.659 --> 01:57:24.522]  I said, no matter what you think causes autism, even if it's vaccines, environmental, anything that's government-related, it's never going to come out.
[01:57:24.722 --> 01:57:25.482]  It's a gravy drain.
[01:57:25.502 --> 01:57:34.145]  Everybody's fighting it because, as I said, the actual funding they save to raise a child from birth to 18 alone is three to five million dollars for one child with autism.
[01:57:35.628 --> 01:57:39.110]  Well it's also meant to collapse families, like collapsing health care.
[01:57:39.370 --> 01:57:42.951]  You've got children with, I mean, tell folks what you go through with autistic children.
[01:57:44.292 --> 01:57:45.433]  It's even worse.
[01:57:45.473 --> 01:57:53.776]  Let me say this, you know, the worst part of all of this is there's a 90% almost divorce rate of families with a special needs child.
[01:57:54.316 --> 01:58:00.179]  Because not only is there this financial burden, usually one parent cannot work, they have to be a full-time caretaker.
[01:58:00.199 --> 01:58:01.960]  No, no, it's a torpedo to destroy the family.
[01:58:02.745 --> 01:58:07.269]  There's, you know, there's financial problems, there's stressors that, I mean, we can't even begin.
[01:58:07.289 --> 01:58:14.736]  You know, I actually have my own show now on the Autism Speaks Network that is real life, like, this is what I live every day, so people can see the real world.
[01:58:14.776 --> 01:58:18.699]  We went on our first date to a movie since the children were born just recently.
[01:58:18.739 --> 01:58:27.888]  We're literally almost, you could say, prisoners in our own home most of the time because they can't transition, we can't take them quickly to the supermarket.
[01:58:28.288 --> 01:58:30.269]  Obama says give kids anthrax shots.
[01:58:30.549 --> 01:58:31.370]  You want to thank him?
[01:58:31.410 --> 01:58:32.030]  He loves kids.
[01:58:32.050 --> 01:58:33.231]  He's got a Nobel Peace Prize.
[01:58:33.952 --> 01:58:35.873]  That's a no comment.
[01:58:35.893 --> 01:58:41.696]  You know, not for nothing, but when I grew up, there wasn't autism schools being built everywhere such as we have here, and they're not small.
[01:58:41.716 --> 01:58:42.377]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:58:42.657 --> 01:58:43.037]  Exactly.
[01:58:43.057 --> 01:58:44.778]  In the old days, the Nazis mowed you down.
[01:58:44.798 --> 01:58:46.299]  Now they just soft kill you.
[01:58:46.319 --> 01:58:46.800]  We'll be back.
[01:58:46.820 --> 01:58:47.220]  Stay there.
[01:58:47.260 --> 01:58:47.800]  Back in 60 seconds.

[01:59:00.359 --> 01:59:08.626]  Devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, or the threat of martial law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies.
[01:59:08.906 --> 01:59:12.349]  As a result, millions are stockpiling food, gold, and weapons.

[02:00:26.841 --> 02:00:30.924]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:40.475 --> 02:00:42.496]  Dan and Candy Spitz are guests.
[02:00:42.556 --> 02:00:43.837]  He's the founder of Anthrax.
[02:00:43.897 --> 02:00:44.958]  DanSpitz.com.
[02:00:45.018 --> 02:00:46.219]  AutismSpeaks.org.
[02:00:48.100 --> 02:00:50.882]  Candy heads up the Autism Speaks organization.
[02:00:50.922 --> 02:00:51.883]  It's an excellent site.
[02:00:52.863 --> 02:00:53.784]  Here's the deal, folks.
[02:00:53.804 --> 02:00:54.704]  They're already killing you.
[02:00:54.865 --> 02:00:59.207]  They're already... Look, the authoritarians know they can't just come up and shoot you in the head until they've got your guns.
[02:00:59.227 --> 02:00:59.968]  They'll do that later.
[02:00:59.988 --> 02:01:03.430]  That's what the two billion bullets are for and the life-size targets of children.
[02:01:06.632 --> 02:01:07.373]  They're training
[02:01:08.732 --> 02:01:10.232]  For the total implosion of society.
[02:01:10.252 --> 02:01:12.433]  They want to reduce the world population down to nothing.
[02:01:12.933 --> 02:01:14.953]  Dan, how do we get really aggressive?
[02:01:14.973 --> 02:01:16.694]  Candy, how do we get really aggressive?
[02:01:16.714 --> 02:01:17.974]  Because you can't sue them.
[02:01:17.994 --> 02:01:20.755]  They've been given liability protection, just like they're giving Monsanto now.
[02:01:21.715 --> 02:01:26.216]  So their crops can grow their own pesticides that kill the bugs, but it's safe for us to eat, they say.
[02:01:26.236 --> 02:01:30.197]  I mean, is there any doubt that this is a holocaust going on?
[02:01:31.240 --> 02:01:36.044]  You know, all I can do on my end is the same thing I did in my first round in Anthrax.
[02:01:36.224 --> 02:01:36.905]  What am I going to do?
[02:01:37.365 --> 02:01:39.006]  Start a new band, but it's not normal.
[02:01:39.186 --> 02:01:41.208]  It's educate the public through the truth.
[02:01:41.508 --> 02:01:43.230]  And in heavy metal, that's what we do.
[02:01:43.670 --> 02:01:46.032]  Let the public take it in their own hands.
[02:01:46.052 --> 02:01:47.413]  I'm not here to sell anything.
[02:01:47.874 --> 02:01:50.736]  I'm here to just, you know, play my guitar, take it around the world.
[02:01:51.176 --> 02:01:57.081]  You know, there's a song called Puzzle Box that Dave Mustaine and I wrote the lyrics for that is our daily struggle with our children.
[02:01:57.481 --> 02:02:02.486]  Welcome, you know, in our music, it's welcome in our family because you are part of our family.
[02:02:02.766 --> 02:02:07.870]  And we're the only kind of music that can speak that truth and put it in the hands of three generations of heavy metal people.
[02:02:07.990 --> 02:02:08.911]  They'll know what to do with it.
[02:02:10.012 --> 02:02:11.313]  Believe me, they'll know what to do with it.
[02:02:11.773 --> 02:02:13.335]  And then Candy has her end, you know.
[02:02:13.355 --> 02:02:15.677]  I want to talk about that briefly in the next segment.
[02:02:15.837 --> 02:02:16.698]  This is a short one.
[02:02:17.708 --> 02:02:21.032]  You know, isn't Dave Mustaine a great guy and his wife Pam and everybody?
[02:02:21.272 --> 02:02:26.218]  The media demonizes anybody that they know is real and anybody that has a voice.
[02:02:26.918 --> 02:02:30.382]  And, you know, it's good to see Dave standing up as well against what's happening.
[02:02:30.703 --> 02:02:34.247]  And as more and more people stand up together, we will bring these criminals to justice.
[02:02:35.097 --> 02:02:36.638]  Yeah, well, you know, Dave's lived at our house.
[02:02:36.678 --> 02:02:37.579]  He's held our children.
[02:02:37.599 --> 02:02:39.020]  He knows my daily struggle.
[02:02:39.080 --> 02:02:41.241]  We've been close friends for forever and ever and ever.
[02:02:41.601 --> 02:02:44.283]  You know, hold each other up when we're having a bad day kind of friends.
[02:02:44.343 --> 02:02:46.765]  So, you know, he knows what the truth is.
[02:02:47.165 --> 02:03:00.354]  He knows when my phone rings a hundred times a day or Candy's text messaging me that the police are at Target because she tried to take the kids to the store and someone called the police because they think that, you know, she's actually beating her kid.
[02:03:00.394 --> 02:03:03.236]  But meanwhile, one of them is just having a meltdown in the parking lot.
[02:03:03.276 --> 02:03:05.077]  He can't transition in or out of the house.
[02:03:05.157 --> 02:03:07.839]  But again, this is the total takeover of the secret police.
[02:03:07.879 --> 02:03:09.640]  Your kid is all over the place.
[02:03:09.900 --> 02:03:13.223]  You're having to restrain him, call the cops who would just taser him.
[02:03:13.603 --> 02:03:15.965]  This country is so screwed up under psych warfare.
[02:03:16.145 --> 02:03:20.087]  Oh no, they'll call child services and candies, you know, since I can't believe what's going on.
[02:03:20.127 --> 02:03:24.370]  Now they have to be visited by child services or whatever it may be because people don't understand.
[02:03:24.410 --> 02:03:25.291]  And that's what we're trying to do.
[02:03:25.451 --> 02:03:31.035]  Educate the public that it's 1 in 50, you know, if you're on a floor in the hospital having a baby, now there's 50 rooms, you know.
[02:03:31.135 --> 02:03:32.077]  Let's do the math.
[02:03:32.298 --> 02:03:35.406]  It was 1 in 25,000 30 years ago, and now it's 1 in 50.
[02:03:36.650 --> 02:03:38.695]  They're estimating, what, in a decade it's going to be 1 in 10?
[02:03:40.469 --> 02:03:41.530]  The study's already old.
[02:03:41.550 --> 02:03:45.471]  You know, the studies you're getting now are years old, so I don't even want to estimate anything.
[02:03:45.491 --> 02:03:47.232]  And then they say, oh, it's overestimated.
[02:03:47.252 --> 02:03:47.712]  I know this.
[02:03:48.192 --> 02:03:54.915]  I try to take my children to a movie now, and a third of the kids in there will be autistic, you know, the whole time, yelling and screaming.
[02:03:54.935 --> 02:03:58.056]  And I feel sorry for them, but I mean, they're building whole schools, whole wings.
[02:03:58.116 --> 02:04:05.299]  I go to the park, sometimes they'll be like half the kids are hardcore autistic, and it makes me angry at the New World Order.
[02:04:05.979 --> 02:04:09.821]  Well, I mean, Candy was just at the, at the, uh, with Ernie Els, the, the golfer.
[02:04:09.841 --> 02:04:13.223]  Tell him he's building one of the largest schools anywhere, period.
[02:04:13.743 --> 02:04:14.684]  It's right down here.
[02:04:14.764 --> 02:04:19.467]  It's, he had to raise $40 million to build a school, to have sport, sports education and everything.
[02:04:19.487 --> 02:04:23.389]  I mean, we didn't have this, you know, we didn't have this in our generation.
[02:04:23.409 --> 02:04:26.110]  Well, soon everybody, soon it'll be every other baby.
[02:04:26.150 --> 02:04:30.513]  Then, then one out of 10 babies will be normal and it'll just be collapsed society.
[02:04:30.553 --> 02:04:33.735]  That's, you want, do you guys know about the eugenics extermination plan?
[02:04:34.375 --> 02:04:35.716]  Yeah, well where's everyone going to work?
[02:04:35.896 --> 02:04:36.777]  You know what I'm trying to say?
[02:04:36.797 --> 02:04:37.878]  No, it's going to be robots.
[02:04:37.898 --> 02:04:38.678]  Then we're gone.
[02:04:38.999 --> 02:04:39.639]  Ray Kurzweil.
[02:04:39.699 --> 02:04:40.560]  It's all been decided.
[02:04:40.860 --> 02:04:43.542]  Bill Joy wrote about it in Wired Magazine.
[02:04:43.562 --> 02:04:44.523]  You know, he's a billionaire.
[02:04:44.783 --> 02:04:45.423]  He went to the meeting.
[02:04:46.004 --> 02:04:46.985]  He wrote about it 12 years ago.
[02:04:47.025 --> 02:04:48.546]  The decision's been made to kill everybody.
[02:04:51.195 --> 02:04:55.539]  So, but first they've got to wipe everybody out, blow out our... I'm sorry folks, it's real, okay?
[02:04:56.039 --> 02:04:58.701]  I mean, it's all in eco-science, it's all in their own books.
[02:04:59.182 --> 02:05:00.083]  They're doing it to us.
[02:05:00.123 --> 02:05:01.504]  I've been warning you for 17 years.
[02:05:01.524 --> 02:05:06.208]  We're going to come back with our guests and talk about solutions on the other side.
[02:05:06.268 --> 02:05:07.089]  It just blows me away.
[02:05:12.057 --> 02:05:19.744]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal Ben Soap Company.

[02:06:12.724 --> 02:06:17.547]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[02:06:17.727 --> 02:06:24.891]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.

[02:07:59.610 --> 02:08:06.081]  You aren't always at home, but SimpliSafe will stand guard, protecting your property 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
[02:08:06.642 --> 02:08:08.805]  Again, that's GetSimpliSafe.com
[02:08:27.310 --> 02:08:35.056]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:37.958 --> 02:08:41.621]  You know, people ask me why I get so aggressive.
[02:08:41.641 --> 02:08:42.942]  They ask me, is that for real?
[02:08:43.383 --> 02:08:44.464]  Howard Stern asked me that.
[02:08:44.584 --> 02:08:45.965]  I mean, you're really getting mad.
[02:08:45.985 --> 02:08:46.946]  He goes, because it looks real.
[02:08:48.564 --> 02:08:50.046]  And you better believe I get mad.
[02:08:50.186 --> 02:08:58.395]  I am the sweetest guy with kitty cats and puppy dogs and butterflies and I like to paint, you know, French impressionistic scenes.
[02:08:59.056 --> 02:08:59.716]  I love my wife.
[02:08:59.757 --> 02:09:00.557]  I love my children.
[02:09:01.525 --> 02:09:02.426]  And let me tell you something.
[02:09:02.546 --> 02:09:08.729]  I've got a lot of friends and family, on average, who have 18-month-old boys, mainly, because they don't have as strong a blood-brain barrier as women.
[02:09:09.149 --> 02:09:10.650]  This is just mainline medical science.
[02:09:11.431 --> 02:09:14.092]  Who go in for the third round of shots, and their kids have convulsions.
[02:09:14.112 --> 02:09:16.493]  They lay there on the couch for two, three days, four days.
[02:09:17.114 --> 02:09:18.054]  They go to the hospital.
[02:09:18.094 --> 02:09:18.895]  CPS comes.
[02:09:18.935 --> 02:09:19.815]  What'd you do to your kid?
[02:09:20.736 --> 02:09:21.916]  And meanwhile, they see this.
[02:09:21.956 --> 02:09:23.077]  I've talked to ER doctors.
[02:09:23.117 --> 02:09:24.037]  They see it all the time.
[02:09:24.598 --> 02:09:26.039]  They'll ask, have they had any shots?
[02:09:26.059 --> 02:09:30.021]  And they're like, they knew until four years ago, never give a pregnant woman shots.
[02:09:31.075 --> 02:09:31.395]  Okay.
[02:09:32.776 --> 02:09:36.718]  I've got a lot of family that are oral surgeons, dentists, doctors, veterinarians.
[02:09:37.339 --> 02:09:41.261]  I mean, you know, you don't give shots to baby cows until they're a few months old.
[02:09:41.961 --> 02:09:43.162]  Everybody knows this.
[02:09:44.202 --> 02:09:46.784]  And they try to sit there and act like they don't know what's going on.
[02:09:47.044 --> 02:09:49.625]  But you've heard the ER doctors call in, and we've had them on as guests.
[02:09:50.386 --> 02:09:53.848]  I mean, they see the vaccine damage every day at the bigger hospitals.
[02:09:54.868 --> 02:09:57.430]  And they've always said, don't give pregnant women shots.
[02:09:57.490 --> 02:09:59.031]  Now the CDC says, do it.
[02:09:59.775 --> 02:10:00.115]  Do it.
[02:10:00.395 --> 02:10:03.837]  And it causes all sorts of autoimmune problems, miscarriages.
[02:10:03.857 --> 02:10:08.739]  So what they're doing is they're just trying to normalize incredible stuff off the chart.
[02:10:10.260 --> 02:10:12.160]  And I'm here to break people out of their trance.
[02:10:12.841 --> 02:10:22.065]  I yell and scream and I get angry and I call these people names because, folks, I feel like a coward for not organizing mass aggressive rallies.
[02:10:22.205 --> 02:10:24.386]  I've done big rallies.
[02:10:24.426 --> 02:10:26.687]  I've stormed the Capitol over the TSA.
[02:10:27.935 --> 02:10:32.999]  I mean, I know authoritarianism and I'm desperate because I have empathy, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:10:34.019 --> 02:10:50.952]  When I know people and see their children hurt and then I know it's all on purpose and I've got all the UN documents and we've made films and all the quotes and Bertrand Russell, how they'd use vaccines to dumb down the public and they're just killing us and maiming us.
[02:10:51.272 --> 02:10:52.413]  Thousands of kids die.
[02:10:53.447 --> 02:10:55.308]  You're about, I mean, it's just incredible.
[02:10:56.269 --> 02:11:04.233]  And that it's all a lie, it's all a hoax, and there even is real science for autoimmune stuff where you actually could have some vaccines.
[02:11:04.533 --> 02:11:05.573]  It's a real science.
[02:11:06.014 --> 02:11:11.877]  Doesn't mean it might not be linked to other problems or stunting your immune system or doing other things, but you know, it's a real science.
[02:11:11.917 --> 02:11:13.638]  If there was something out there killing people en masse,
[02:11:14.338 --> 02:11:18.160]  But, you know, but polio had a cancer virus in it, the vaccine.
[02:11:18.340 --> 02:11:19.101]  So I'm ranting.
[02:11:19.121 --> 02:11:20.101]  We've got our guest here.
[02:11:20.542 --> 02:11:25.985]  The reason I get so upset is the magnitude of the evil is so great.
[02:11:28.264 --> 02:11:30.086]  That the average person can't even believe it.
[02:11:30.106 --> 02:11:32.288]  I mean, just type in Harvard study fluoride.
[02:11:32.668 --> 02:11:36.912]  They knew a hundred years ago sodium fluoride and the dosages that are in the water causes brain damage.
[02:11:37.393 --> 02:11:42.377]  They know mercury is one of the most tested things ever because it's been used industrially for thousands of years.
[02:11:42.718 --> 02:11:49.404]  They know in electrochemical reactions from electron microscopes that it is the most destructive heavy metal in the brain.
[02:11:49.944 --> 02:11:51.566]  In fact, guys, go to YouTube and type in
[02:11:53.507 --> 02:11:55.850]  Electron microscope, mercury and brain tissue.
[02:11:56.711 --> 02:11:58.753]  It's the University of Calgary, it's one of the better shots.
[02:11:59.273 --> 02:12:08.243]  And it's the only heavy metal that actually makes a chain reaction happen and causes chain reactions of the cells to actually blow out.
[02:12:08.783 --> 02:12:09.784]  This is electrochemical.
[02:12:10.325 --> 02:12:13.869]  Lead, mercury, arsenic, even cyanide doesn't do that.
[02:12:15.237 --> 02:12:16.598]  And yeah, here it is.
[02:12:17.938 --> 02:12:22.820]  This is Faculty of Medicine and they actually show what mercury does.
[02:12:22.840 --> 02:12:23.600]  We're going to show that.
[02:12:24.080 --> 02:12:25.481]  This is what they say is good for your brain.
[02:12:25.521 --> 02:12:26.441]  I played that last hour.
[02:12:26.481 --> 02:12:28.682]  They say mercury is good for your child's brain.
[02:12:29.042 --> 02:12:30.643]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is hyper...
[02:12:31.303 --> 02:12:31.883]  Destructive.
[02:12:31.923 --> 02:12:40.668]  So going back to the founder of Anthrax, Dan Spitz, and Candy, his wife, who heads up AutismSpeaks.org, what else do you want to impart to people?
[02:12:40.708 --> 02:12:41.388]  Solutions?
[02:12:41.929 --> 02:12:42.549]  Ideas?
[02:12:43.109 --> 02:12:44.570]  There's no law to take shots.
[02:12:44.690 --> 02:12:46.311]  Fight them trying to make it the law.
[02:12:47.052 --> 02:12:50.353]  Learn that the flu shot actually doubles your chances of getting flu.
[02:12:50.413 --> 02:12:51.294]  That's major studies.
[02:12:51.974 --> 02:12:53.295]  What else do you want to impart to people?
[02:12:54.301 --> 02:12:56.282]  Right now, all you can really do is educate yourself.
[02:12:56.462 --> 02:13:00.064]  There's nothing that we can do as a people to stop this.
[02:13:00.485 --> 02:13:02.886]  And that's why I said, you know, I'm the spokesperson for Autism Speaks.
[02:13:02.906 --> 02:13:05.627]  And the reason I dedicate my time, this is not a paying job.
[02:13:05.707 --> 02:13:08.189]  They don't, you know, this is not something I'm being forced to do.
[02:13:08.849 --> 02:13:15.913]  I dedicated my life to this organization because Bob and Suzanne Wright, who founded Autism Speaks, are out there actually doing exactly what you're saying.
[02:13:15.993 --> 02:13:22.677]  They're searching for every possible connection, whether it be government related, vaccine related, environmental, whatever this is.
[02:13:23.257 --> 02:13:24.098]  They're out there doing it.
[02:13:24.558 --> 02:13:34.665]  So let them do their job, and they do a very good job of this, and you know, I said I'm personally involved on that level, but you as a parent, you as a society, you as a teacher, educator, educate yourself.
[02:13:35.065 --> 02:13:35.926]  Learn your options.
[02:13:36.166 --> 02:13:44.792]  Know if you do need to vaccinate, if you don't need to vaccinate, if you suspect something, what you can do right now while the kids are still young to fix this problem.
[02:13:45.052 --> 02:13:47.454]  A lot of our problems are correctable.
[02:13:47.654 --> 02:13:49.876]  It is not a cure, but they are correctable.
[02:13:50.536 --> 02:13:53.918]  And you as a parent need to take responsibility for your own child.
[02:13:54.478 --> 02:13:55.398]  Every child is different.
[02:13:55.538 --> 02:13:59.320]  There's not going to be, you know, you've seen one child with autism, you've seen one child with autism.
[02:13:59.980 --> 02:14:04.302]  You need to learn how to make your family work, how to work into their world.
[02:14:04.823 --> 02:14:07.604]  They are never going to fit into our society.
[02:14:08.331 --> 02:14:08.992]  All of our children.
[02:14:09.252 --> 02:14:11.533]  They are very highly intelligent in their own way.
[02:14:11.553 --> 02:14:15.556]  And you need to find a way to adapt you into their world.
[02:14:16.257 --> 02:14:17.678]  So all I can say is educate yourself.
[02:14:18.198 --> 02:14:18.838]  Learn the steps.
[02:14:18.878 --> 02:14:20.219]  You know, there's a lot of organizations.
[02:14:20.299 --> 02:14:22.361]  Autism Speaks is not the only one out there.
[02:14:22.801 --> 02:14:24.062]  But we put the facts out there.
[02:14:24.422 --> 02:14:26.163]  Everything good and bad is on the website.
[02:14:26.183 --> 02:14:26.844]  There's toolkits.
[02:14:26.884 --> 02:14:27.785]  They're going to help you.
[02:14:28.125 --> 02:14:30.947]  And if they can't help you, they're going to guide you to who can help you.
[02:14:31.307 --> 02:14:32.348]  So just educate yourself.
[02:14:33.120 --> 02:14:49.271]  And that's what I'm trying to do with Red Lamb, which is the project that Dean and Dave Mustaine have together, and I took that on the road, and we had sponsors wrap our bus to bring awareness into the heavy metal community, where we all do take things into our hand.
[02:14:49.451 --> 02:14:55.675]  That's right, big things have small beginnings, because a lot of heavy metal guys will probably ignore you because they're young and they're not worried about it.
[02:14:55.935 --> 02:15:02.880]  They're going to get married, they're going to have a kid, their kid's going to go into a convulsion, and then they're going to go completely haywire and they're going to save millions of other kids.
[02:15:03.080 --> 02:15:13.525]  Yeah, but what they're gonna do is go, hey, wait a minute, hey, wait a minute, there's that spitz kid from Anthrax, Red Lamb, whatever that was, his kids have autism, and I remember something about that kid, you know, look him up, and you know what?
[02:15:13.625 --> 02:15:14.465]  That's what I'm trying to do.
[02:15:14.485 --> 02:15:20.949]  No, no, I agree, you're trying to save them, but I'm saying there's still even more that aren't gonna listen right now.
[02:15:21.249 --> 02:15:23.350]  They trust the government, they're listening right now.
[02:15:24.284 --> 02:15:26.689]  And they're gonna go out and get the shot and they're gonna see it happen.
[02:15:27.571 --> 02:15:33.222]  You gotta kinda try to untrain the monkey a little bit if you know what I'm trying to say and that's what I'm trying to do.
[02:15:33.510 --> 02:15:40.353]  Well, there's nothing you can really do right now to stop this from happening because there are so many different possible causes.
[02:15:40.373 --> 02:15:41.754]  You know, there's no way.
[02:15:41.814 --> 02:15:45.675]  You can't avoid, you know, food, water, you know, shots.
[02:15:45.756 --> 02:15:47.196]  You can't avoid everything out there.
[02:15:47.216 --> 02:15:48.277]  And some of this is genetic.
[02:15:48.317 --> 02:15:51.718]  There's a small portion of people with autism who are born genetically with autism.
[02:15:51.738 --> 02:15:53.819]  There's Fragile X. There's other forms.
[02:15:54.419 --> 02:15:56.200]  So there's nothing you can do to stop it.
[02:15:56.780 --> 02:15:59.842]  So you just need to know what to do once it's in your face.
[02:16:00.407 --> 02:16:07.670]  Because even if you don't have a child... Well sure, but we have the causal effect in all the studies that the vaccines are the big kahuna.
[02:16:08.170 --> 02:16:12.332]  Obviously pesticide, bisphenol A, additives, aspartame.
[02:16:12.832 --> 02:16:14.853]  Aspartame, you know, in the drinks for the babies.
[02:16:14.913 --> 02:16:16.894]  I mean, just insane stuff.
[02:16:16.914 --> 02:16:18.975]  But I mean, I've had all the top scientists on.
[02:16:19.015 --> 02:16:20.636]  I know you've interviewed them, you've talked to them.
[02:16:22.336 --> 02:16:31.219]  All doctors know, and also vets in animal husbandry, that female mammals are stronger than male mammals.
[02:16:31.239 --> 02:16:39.902]  I don't mean physically, obviously, but women can be shot more times, women can be starved longer, because women are designed to have babies.
[02:16:40.242 --> 02:16:42.163]  Women have a much stronger immune system.
[02:16:42.463 --> 02:16:45.544]  Boys can't handle the mercury right in the bloodstream.
[02:16:45.564 --> 02:16:46.665]  That's why it's hitting the boys.
[02:16:46.925 --> 02:16:50.266]  And so, yes, genetically they're predisposed to be hurt by it.
[02:16:50.779 --> 02:17:01.525]  Well, that's why I say when I do meet people or we talk to people who are in that realm of thinking about having a child or under the 12-month level and they have a boy, you know, be aware.
[02:17:01.585 --> 02:17:03.246]  Is he developing slower than normal?
[02:17:03.286 --> 02:17:04.647]  Just in general, immune system.
[02:17:04.687 --> 02:17:07.648]  Did he have a colic or whatever it may be?
[02:17:07.708 --> 02:17:08.128]  You know what?
[02:17:08.509 --> 02:17:10.270]  You know, find a way to deter those shots.
[02:17:10.330 --> 02:17:16.073]  Go somewhere where they can be spread out over a longer period of time and take that simple precaution, at least in that one area.
[02:17:17.045 --> 02:17:18.606]  Yeah, but see, I got three children.
[02:17:18.626 --> 02:17:19.707]  They've never had a vaccine.
[02:17:19.727 --> 02:17:20.427]  Sorry, go ahead, Candy.
[02:17:20.787 --> 02:17:22.648]  No, see, more importantly, just trust your instincts.
[02:17:22.709 --> 02:17:27.872]  Do not rely on, you know, medical professionals, teachers, doctors, anybody out there.
[02:17:28.232 --> 02:17:29.493]  Trust your instinct as a parent.
[02:17:29.553 --> 02:17:34.096]  You know what's best, whether it's food, you know, water, vaccine, whatever it happens to be.
[02:17:34.376 --> 02:17:36.337]  You know what's best, so just trust your own instincts.
[02:17:36.377 --> 02:17:46.183]  Sure, what about Bill Gates coming out with clothes and fruit and other produce where it's in there and you don't have a choice because we don't know best.
[02:17:46.203 --> 02:17:48.605]  They're going to force all these high-tech vaccines.
[02:17:48.625 --> 02:17:55.169]  Have you heard about the anti-drug vaccines that actually eat parts of the brain so you can never upload alcohol or cocaine?
[02:17:58.491 --> 02:17:59.932]  What's the heavy metal people going to do?
[02:18:02.057 --> 02:18:02.477]  Oh boy.
[02:18:02.537 --> 02:18:06.801]  Well, it actually gives you a type of lobotomy because those same receptors take on endorphins.
[02:18:07.982 --> 02:18:10.404]  Look up my video, Brain Eating Vaccines.
[02:18:10.424 --> 02:18:12.365]  I mean, I gave it a Hollywood name so people would watch it.
[02:18:12.726 --> 02:18:14.027]  Brain Eating Vaccines.
[02:18:14.407 --> 02:18:15.968]  And it actually shows all the documents.
[02:18:16.188 --> 02:18:20.812]  They're saying, soon you won't ever worry again because you're going to have no emotion.
[02:18:21.092 --> 02:18:22.633]  Sounds like body snatchers, doesn't it?
[02:18:22.654 --> 02:18:23.554]  Wow.
[02:18:23.574 --> 02:18:24.175]  That's scary.
[02:18:24.835 --> 02:18:25.456]  That's crazy.
[02:18:26.121 --> 02:18:26.561]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:18:26.581 --> 02:18:29.002]  There's nothing you can do to avoid some of what's going on right now.
[02:18:29.282 --> 02:18:33.383]  So that's why the two of us, our main mission is not to, you know, fund research.
[02:18:33.403 --> 02:18:35.404]  We're not out there fundraising for anything.
[02:18:35.424 --> 02:18:36.764]  Not even for the band.
[02:18:36.784 --> 02:18:37.844]  You're just warning people.
[02:18:38.204 --> 02:18:39.905]  It's more, no, it's just awareness and advocacy.
[02:18:39.925 --> 02:18:42.165]  Because the face of society is about to change.
[02:18:42.486 --> 02:18:45.186]  In the next 20 years, everybody will have something.
[02:18:45.226 --> 02:18:47.387]  ADD, ADHD, OCD, autism.
[02:18:48.027 --> 02:18:49.048]  Everything is changing.
[02:18:49.128 --> 02:18:50.569]  Yeah, because they're poisoning us.
[02:18:50.769 --> 02:18:54.191]  You need to learn how to function as a whole now.
[02:18:54.331 --> 02:19:01.496]  There's a whole new way of thinking and the old ways of, you know, tantrums and meltdowns and what people thought before, it just doesn't exist.
[02:19:01.736 --> 02:19:02.577]  The world has changed.
[02:19:03.017 --> 02:19:05.178]  Yeah, the new world order is here.
[02:19:05.278 --> 02:19:13.684]  If you think it doesn't, then in about 25 minutes when Kandi picks up our children, you're all welcome to come here and see the transition from the car to the house.
[02:19:15.677 --> 02:19:19.540]  Well, listen, I want to get you guys back on next time you've got a big initiative going.
[02:19:19.560 --> 02:19:20.881]  I know the bus is wrapped right now.
[02:19:20.921 --> 02:19:22.002]  You're traveling around.
[02:19:22.062 --> 02:19:23.083]  Great job on that front.
[02:19:23.103 --> 02:19:28.668]  I want to give the website out, danspitz.com, and then, of course, autismspeaks.org.
[02:19:29.188 --> 02:19:34.332]  And check out the project you've got with Dave Mustaine of Megadeth, Red Lamb.
[02:19:34.352 --> 02:19:40.417]  I want to thank Dave Mustaine when he was staying at my house last week for putting me in touch with you to help get the word out on this.
[02:19:40.557 --> 02:19:42.779]  And guys, we'll talk again very, very soon.
[02:19:42.839 --> 02:19:43.440]  Thank you so much.
[02:19:43.900 --> 02:19:44.681]  We got you guys.
[02:19:44.741 --> 02:19:45.641]  Thank you very much.
[02:19:45.922 --> 02:19:47.983]  Alright, amazing people, Dan and Candy Spitz.
[02:19:48.343 --> 02:19:49.184]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:19:49.284 --> 02:19:54.988]  Coming up, Korea threatening to nuke South Korea, Japan, and the U.S., and to launch the missiles tomorrow.
[02:19:55.568 --> 02:20:00.192]  I'm not into war, but they should be struck right there, but then that starts World War III.
[02:20:01.092 --> 02:20:03.434]  And it's government causing that problem, not individuals.
[02:20:04.715 --> 02:20:06.596]  Kim Jong-il, I think he needs a couple shots.
[02:20:07.477 --> 02:20:08.197]  We'll be right back.
[02:20:08.217 --> 02:20:08.678]  Stay with us.
[02:20:10.191 --> 02:20:12.092]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[02:20:12.132 --> 02:20:14.374]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[02:20:14.514 --> 02:20:20.497]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[02:20:20.517 --> 02:20:23.719]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[02:20:23.980 --> 02:20:27.702]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[02:20:27.862 --> 02:20:29.043]  The fact is, you are.
[02:20:29.243 --> 02:20:30.023]  We all are.
[02:20:30.283 --> 02:20:32.605]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[02:20:32.905 --> 02:20:41.190]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoodsDirect.
[02:20:41.390 --> 02:20:42.591]  Be prepared before you need it.

[02:20:46.233 --> 02:20:48.455]  You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed you.

[02:21:10.143 --> 02:21:18.389]  Devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, or the threat of martial law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies.
[02:21:18.689 --> 02:21:22.131]  As a result, millions are stockpiling food, gold, and weapons.
[02:21:22.371 --> 02:21:26.534]  But how will these items help if you or one of your loved ones becomes ill?
[02:21:26.834 --> 02:21:31.597]  Supernatural silver is the ultimate tool to prepare you for a medical emergency.
[02:21:31.878 --> 02:21:39.383]  Supernatural silver is a natural antibiotic that is uniquely effective against bacteria, viruses, moles, and fungus,
[02:21:40.043 --> 02:21:41.183]  We're good to go.
[02:22:11.010 --> 02:22:13.852]  Ceramic Body Armor is rated to stop six hits.
[02:22:14.132 --> 02:22:15.292]  But what about the seventh?
[02:22:15.512 --> 02:22:19.555]  Unlike Ceramic or Kevlar, Infidel Body Armor is proven to take hit after hit.
[02:22:19.775 --> 02:22:21.095]  And it just won't quit.
[02:22:21.336 --> 02:22:27.819]  Reasonably priced and designed for the smart civilian prepper, Infidel stops hundreds of hits from small arms to high-powered rifles.
[02:22:28.039 --> 02:22:30.000]  That means safety and peace of mind.

[02:22:32.622 --> 02:22:36.484]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[02:22:36.624 --> 02:22:38.905]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[02:22:39.065 --> 02:22:48.331]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[02:22:48.391 --> 02:22:49.132]  This capitalism?
[02:22:49.192 --> 02:22:55.336]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:22:55.476 --> 02:22:56.237]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[02:22:56.277 --> 02:22:59.359]  I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[02:24:18.404 --> 02:24:21.666]  If you're just joining us, Dan Spitz, the founder of Anthrax, was on with us.
[02:24:21.706 --> 02:24:25.648]  Both of his totally healthy twin boys that were already acting in movies.
[02:24:27.249 --> 02:24:27.969]  At a year old.
[02:24:29.570 --> 02:24:31.691]  Got vaccines and phew, gone.
[02:24:31.711 --> 02:24:35.773]  Lay on the couch for five days and... This is everybody I've talked to.
[02:24:35.893 --> 02:24:38.174]  I mean, and a lot of people, the kids don't end up being autistic.
[02:24:38.194 --> 02:24:38.835]  They get the shot.
[02:24:39.591 --> 02:24:43.673]  You know, they go to sleep for two days, they don't talk for a while, then they come out of it.
[02:24:44.173 --> 02:24:46.954]  And that's just God, you know, fighting through and helping the kids.
[02:24:46.994 --> 02:24:52.896]  But, you know, I like candy spits, but what the establishment does is they say, don't be too radical.
[02:24:53.356 --> 02:24:54.677]  This happened with Jenny McCarthy.
[02:24:55.337 --> 02:24:57.038]  Don't be too radical, it scares people.
[02:24:58.378 --> 02:25:03.460]  Well, the globalists are radical, and only admitting how radical the attack is will defeat the attack.
[02:25:04.700 --> 02:25:05.681]  Okay, this is an attack.
[02:25:06.983 --> 02:25:09.485]  And, you know, she's like, we'll space out the shots.
[02:25:09.585 --> 02:25:11.307]  Listen, I got three children.
[02:25:11.567 --> 02:25:13.228]  They've never had a needle in them.
[02:25:14.769 --> 02:25:18.132]  And we had our first child, you know, you fill out, you know, the orders you want.
[02:25:18.152 --> 02:25:21.015]  And they were like trying to not even give us those, you know.
[02:25:22.035 --> 02:25:23.416]  And then they're like, you don't want vaccines?
[02:25:23.456 --> 02:25:25.538]  And I said, look, don't try to tell me it's the law.
[02:25:25.878 --> 02:25:26.859]  Don't engage in fraud.
[02:25:27.540 --> 02:25:28.240]  They left me alone.
[02:25:28.641 --> 02:25:32.844]  Now, a family that looks scared, they eye you like criminals, like a mark.
[02:25:33.385 --> 02:25:33.725]  They're like,
[02:25:35.216 --> 02:25:36.937]  This is neglect and abuse.
[02:25:36.977 --> 02:25:38.078]  And then they call it that.
[02:25:38.098 --> 02:25:39.759]  There's not even a law and they take your kids.
[02:25:40.139 --> 02:25:42.080]  This is a PSYOP of evil!
[02:25:42.540 --> 02:25:44.402]  And I declare absolute resistance.
[02:25:44.822 --> 02:25:46.063]  God, just heal this land.
[02:25:46.743 --> 02:25:49.044]  I know as adults we deserve a lot of bad for what we've done.
[02:25:49.084 --> 02:25:50.165]  The abortion, everything else.
[02:25:50.285 --> 02:25:50.946]  I've been decadent.
[02:25:51.006 --> 02:25:52.166]  I've been bad in my life as well.
[02:25:53.667 --> 02:25:55.688]  But our Heavenly Father, not the children.
[02:25:59.671 --> 02:26:03.073]  I get physically angry up here when I'm covering these type stories, okay?
[02:26:04.798 --> 02:26:05.499]  I have nightmares.
[02:26:05.519 --> 02:26:06.380]  I'm going to be honest with you.
[02:26:06.440 --> 02:26:09.424]  One time, Mike Hanson, we were, this family was about to have a baby.
[02:26:09.444 --> 02:26:10.886]  They had no criminal record.
[02:26:10.906 --> 02:26:11.887]  He was an auto mechanic.
[02:26:11.967 --> 02:26:15.832]  They lived in a, they were living in a hotel while they moved to another apartment.
[02:26:16.673 --> 02:26:18.635]  And they came and she was blonde-haired, blue-eyed.
[02:26:18.675 --> 02:26:19.056]  So was he.
[02:26:19.096 --> 02:26:20.357]  Those babies can get a half million.
[02:26:22.199 --> 02:26:23.321]  And I'll never forget.
[02:26:25.421 --> 02:26:26.201]  I'll never forget.
[02:26:26.221 --> 02:26:28.082]  We were talking to the family.
[02:26:28.102 --> 02:26:28.802]  They were listeners.
[02:26:28.842 --> 02:26:29.562]  They called in the show.
[02:26:29.602 --> 02:26:32.383]  They said CPS is saying they're going to take the baby when it's born or might.
[02:26:32.903 --> 02:26:33.684]  They called the show.
[02:26:33.704 --> 02:26:37.005]  They gave Mike Hanson's cell phone number when he was running the AXS TV show.
[02:26:37.525 --> 02:26:39.765]  This is like 15 years ago, 16 years ago.
[02:26:41.226 --> 02:26:42.586]  And they called Mike one day.
[02:26:44.827 --> 02:26:54.230]  And when we went down there, we opened the door.
[02:26:56.084 --> 02:27:01.226]  Because the police had got there and the cop was choking the woman, literally like a movie.
[02:27:01.726 --> 02:27:04.808]  Red-handed with his hands on her neck going, sign it, sign it.
[02:27:06.448 --> 02:27:11.351]  And the dad was kept outside and the cop looked up at me and he looked like a bad guy out of a movie.
[02:27:12.771 --> 02:27:15.992]  You know, like a guy you see creeping around parks or something and it hit me.
[02:27:17.652 --> 02:27:24.319]  And my whole instinct was defend that woman, but I knew, he knew, America's mine!
[02:27:24.339 --> 02:27:27.162]  I got this kid, boom, I'm on it.
[02:27:27.442 --> 02:27:28.143]  Like a wolf.
[02:27:28.643 --> 02:27:35.630]  And I knew, and then I famously went and called into a local talk show and broke down and people thought it was my children being taken.
[02:27:35.650 --> 02:27:38.813]  They were like, well he said it was somebody else's kid, why is he so upset?
[02:27:39.554 --> 02:27:43.879]  I was like howling, crying, and it's because I realized they're gonna kill everybody.
[02:27:44.200 --> 02:27:50.207]  They're gonna, listen, listen, what they didn't get is, you notice she was saying, well it's a change of life now.
[02:27:50.587 --> 02:27:58.317]  It's now 1 in 50 from 1 in 25,000 and it's gonna be 1 in 10 and then 1 in 2 and this is just the way we are and you can't stop it.
[02:28:00.103 --> 02:28:01.003]  Did you hear?
[02:28:01.344 --> 02:28:02.184]  You can't stop it.
[02:28:02.204 --> 02:28:03.084]  It's coming to you.
[02:28:03.705 --> 02:28:05.506]  And see, that's the PR being put out.
[02:28:06.186 --> 02:28:07.446]  This is just a way of life.
[02:28:07.487 --> 02:28:08.487]  Like, she's been through it.
[02:28:08.527 --> 02:28:11.588]  She's saying at a subconscious level, you will now drink of this cup.
[02:28:11.648 --> 02:28:12.289]  No, I won't.
[02:28:14.830 --> 02:28:17.831]  But listen, to the cops and everybody, you're all gonna die young too.
[02:28:17.871 --> 02:28:19.592]  You're all gonna get neurological disorders.
[02:28:19.612 --> 02:28:21.293]  People are getting Alzheimer's at 45 now.
[02:28:21.313 --> 02:28:22.213]  They just call it dementia.
[02:28:22.434 --> 02:28:23.094]  You're gonna die.
[02:28:23.134 --> 02:28:24.194]  Your family's gonna die.
[02:28:24.454 --> 02:28:25.315]  You're all gonna die.
[02:28:27.059 --> 02:28:28.220]  This isn't dramatics.
[02:28:28.980 --> 02:28:29.841]  I see clearly.
[02:28:30.401 --> 02:28:31.562]  I know the enemy.
[02:28:31.582 --> 02:28:33.504]  Okay?
[02:28:34.885 --> 02:28:36.286]  People say, why aren't you scared then?
[02:28:36.546 --> 02:28:37.907]  Because they're killing everybody.
[02:28:37.967 --> 02:28:38.847]  What is the point?
[02:28:40.188 --> 02:28:42.670]  I'm trying to find the avenue of attack on these people.
[02:28:42.890 --> 02:28:47.734]  I'm trying to find the life force lever to flip in you where you get some simple
[02:28:51.454 --> 02:28:52.354]  Survival instinct.
[02:28:52.394 --> 02:28:57.637]  I mean, they have Lone Star College down in Houston, the same place two gangbangers shot each other, and they said, take the guns.
[02:28:57.937 --> 02:29:06.721]  Now somebody stabbed twelve people with a one-inch X-Acto knife, and they're talking about banning X-Acto knives, because society's a bunch of idiots stabbing each other.
[02:29:09.123 --> 02:29:09.903]  And it's big news!
[02:29:09.983 --> 02:29:10.803]  Oh my gosh!
[02:29:10.843 --> 02:29:13.425]  And there's police and armed guards at that inner-city college.
[02:29:15.086 --> 02:29:19.688]  I mean, that college is in the middle of the ghetto, in one of the roughest cities in America.
[02:29:20.529 --> 02:29:26.116]  And thank God the citizens of Houston have guns to protect themselves or it'd be like Chicago where killers are just killing everybody.
[02:29:27.738 --> 02:29:33.685]  I mean they are sitting there with the X-Acto knife on TV with this doctor salivating over discussing the X-Acto knife.
[02:29:34.986 --> 02:29:42.491]  And getting people to basically freak out in fear over a citizen with a one-inch knife.
[02:29:42.531 --> 02:29:44.612]  Oh, they fall in fear because they're such cowards.
[02:29:44.892 --> 02:29:47.574]  People now, when a coyote comes out in a park, they fall down and it kills them.
[02:29:47.774 --> 02:29:48.855]  Coyotes never attack humans.
[02:29:49.275 --> 02:29:52.197]  People pull a knife, people now fall over like a movie to be stabbed.
[02:29:52.677 --> 02:29:59.402]  That's America, the ultimate jellyfish, coward-filled, pathetic country captured by pot-bellied pedophiles.
[02:29:59.422 --> 02:30:00.162]  We're on the march.
[02:30:00.663 --> 02:30:02.164]  The empire's on the run.
[02:30:03.187 --> 02:30:05.881]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:09.833 --> 02:30:11.474]  Introducing Pro-1.
[02:30:11.734 --> 02:30:15.236]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[02:30:15.376 --> 02:30:19.778]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[02:30:19.918 --> 02:30:25.901]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[02:30:26.021 --> 02:30:36.806]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.
[02:30:37.006 --> 02:30:43.313]  It is the only one that does it, and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[02:30:43.513 --> 02:30:58.250]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands,
[02:30:58.450 --> 02:31:00.474]  And sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[02:31:00.795 --> 02:31:06.124]  Get your Pro-Pure with the new Pro-1 filters today at Infowarsstore.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:31:13.812 --> 02:31:14.733]  Tyranny is here.
[02:31:15.073 --> 02:31:18.595]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:31:18.615 --> 02:31:21.256]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:31:21.396 --> 02:31:26.679]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:31:27.100 --> 02:31:33.403]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:31:33.783 --> 02:31:39.347]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:31:39.747 --> 02:31:43.449]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[02:31:43.929 --> 02:31:47.911]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:31:48.211 --> 02:31:53.694]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:31:54.154 --> 02:31:57.135]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:31:57.715 --> 02:31:59.136]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:31:59.696 --> 02:32:00.196]  It's here.

[02:32:09.693 --> 02:32:11.614]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[02:32:11.634 --> 02:32:13.554]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[02:32:13.794 --> 02:32:19.296]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[02:32:19.516 --> 02:32:23.278]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[02:32:23.558 --> 02:32:27.319]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[02:32:27.479 --> 02:32:28.680]  The fact is, you are.
[02:32:28.880 --> 02:32:29.660]  We all are.
[02:32:29.900 --> 02:32:32.221]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[02:32:32.541 --> 02:32:40.904]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoodsDirect.
[02:32:41.104 --> 02:32:42.305]  Be prepared before you need it.

[02:32:45.966 --> 02:32:48.207]  You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed you.

[02:32:59.051 --> 02:32:59.692]  A new world order.
[02:32:59.712 --> 02:33:00.472]  A new world order.
[02:33:00.693 --> 02:33:03.515]  Joe Biden says there's a new world order, but it doesn't exist.
[02:33:29.881 --> 02:33:30.602]  Oh yeah!
[02:33:35.025 --> 02:33:35.645]  I'm alive!
[02:33:35.665 --> 02:33:40.208]  On the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:41.609 --> 02:33:48.294]  What we are looking at is good and evil, right and wrong.
[02:33:48.314 --> 02:33:49.234]  Time to wake up!
[02:33:49.254 --> 02:33:51.056]  Realize the enemy's running over all of us.
[02:33:52.779 --> 02:33:53.700]  Time to truly live.
[02:33:53.740 --> 02:33:54.821]  Number one, hate the enemy.
[02:33:55.121 --> 02:33:55.902]  Love your family.
[02:33:56.322 --> 02:33:57.683]  Stand up against the scum.
[02:33:57.703 --> 02:33:59.965]  I mean, you're under hardcore attack.
[02:34:00.005 --> 02:34:01.887]  The depopulation program is going on.
[02:34:02.247 --> 02:34:03.528]  Pell-Mell right now.
[02:34:04.109 --> 02:34:06.451]  Liability protection for vaccines, GMO.
[02:34:06.871 --> 02:34:09.654]  Aspartame to be added to basically every product under the sun, not tell you.
[02:34:10.534 --> 02:34:11.976]  Death to the left, death to the right.
[02:34:12.076 --> 02:34:12.956]  Seizures to the left.
[02:34:12.976 --> 02:34:14.418]  Neurological disorders to the right.
[02:34:15.218 --> 02:34:16.500]  I, for one, see through it.
[02:34:16.540 --> 02:34:17.480]  Mike Adams sees through it.
[02:34:17.500 --> 02:34:20.043]  He's got some breaking news here in a moment on Bitcoin.
[02:34:21.414 --> 02:34:32.103]  I haven't even gotten to this article, it's up at DrudgeReport.com, where the child had the water gun, well talked about a water gun at school, and so they took the dad's guns at home out of his gun safe.
[02:34:32.183 --> 02:34:33.845]  I mean, it's just total Sovietization.
[02:34:34.145 --> 02:34:34.845]  Totally illegal!
[02:34:35.406 --> 02:34:36.667]  But they don't care, they do it!
[02:34:36.707 --> 02:34:40.010]  It's about them taking over to keep you safe from Al-Qaeda they run!
[02:34:40.610 --> 02:34:43.533]  And from the mass shootings they stage and set up by making them
[02:34:45.182 --> 02:34:54.749]  Gun-free zones, victim disarmament, mass killer zones, teach the kids to crouch over in a good ball so the killer can get the maximum number of dead so they can hopefully get our guns next time.
[02:34:55.210 --> 02:34:55.910]  Well, guess what?
[02:34:55.950 --> 02:34:56.691]  We're on to you.
[02:34:57.031 --> 02:34:58.472]  This is Boomerang back on you.
[02:34:59.013 --> 02:35:05.278]  By the way, I want to announce the InfoWars.com, InfoWarsHealth.com health challenge.

[02:36:36.321 --> 02:36:39.463]  And hey, did you hear?
[02:36:39.623 --> 02:36:41.885]  Kids abducted by their own parents.
[02:36:41.905 --> 02:36:45.307]  They don't say that here in the USA Today article.
[02:36:45.327 --> 02:36:47.589]  Look at this article for folks watching on TV.
[02:36:47.869 --> 02:36:49.270]  Kids abducted in Florida.
[02:36:50.130 --> 02:36:52.132]  Custody case taken to Cuba.
[02:36:53.544 --> 02:36:54.325]  Kids abducted.
[02:36:54.345 --> 02:36:57.652]  Yeah, you gotta go to another tyranny to escape the ultimate tyranny.
[02:36:57.672 --> 02:36:59.695]  But see, America kinda has a parallel running.
[02:37:00.336 --> 02:37:03.502]  Like the old Liberty's being destroyed while the new tyranny's expanding.
[02:37:03.703 --> 02:37:05.285]  There's like two railroad tracks here.
[02:37:06.980 --> 02:37:09.222]  So we're going to be breaking all of that down.
[02:37:09.282 --> 02:37:19.028]  Now, shifting gears here, ladies and gentlemen, is a NaturalNews.com story that you can also find up at InfoWars.com.
[02:37:19.368 --> 02:37:22.090]  And I want to be clear here with Mike Adams, and I know he's being clear as well.
[02:37:22.411 --> 02:37:36.000]  We support digital fiat currencies, gold currencies, silver currencies, open source currencies, free currencies, diverse currencies, not just the private Federal Reserve note that masquerades as the dollar.
[02:37:37.236 --> 02:37:41.342]  I want to be 110% clear, right now, about that.
[02:37:42.483 --> 02:37:48.492]  My issue is, my spidey sense, months ago, or a year ago, when this first started getting hype, when everybody's talking about it,
[02:37:49.739 --> 02:37:57.945]  You know, when did Kennedy's dad, Joe Kennedy, say he got out of the stock market when a shoeshine boy the day before it crashed told him, you know, told him, you know, what stock to buy.
[02:37:58.005 --> 02:38:00.787]  Actually, he was an insider in Warren, but that was kind of his story.
[02:38:01.447 --> 02:38:05.510]  Everybody's getting into Bitcoin, and it's foggy where it came from.
[02:38:05.570 --> 02:38:12.375]  I'm sure some good libertarians are involved, but this can be used just like they used a fake test to discredit
[02:38:13.175 --> 02:38:19.918]  Uh, alternative energy back in the 80s to try to discredit and then outlaw digital open source currencies.
[02:38:20.678 --> 02:38:23.119]  And I'm very, very worried about this up front.
[02:38:23.179 --> 02:38:24.080]  I've not bought any.
[02:38:25.040 --> 02:38:28.782]  I could tell it was gonna go up the way it was just being hyped and pushed in ways I didn't understand.
[02:38:29.742 --> 02:38:31.984]  And I'm very, very suspicious of the whole thing.
[02:38:32.544 --> 02:38:36.187]  And again, they've gone completely parabolic.
[02:38:36.227 --> 02:38:37.829]  It's going straight up right now.
[02:38:38.729 --> 02:38:45.595]  There's new documents out that the central banks are artificially depressing gold and silver to keep the bond market up and to cover up inflation.
[02:38:46.175 --> 02:38:52.521]  So, this is going straight up, while gold and silver is being driven down a bit right now, which I see as a buying opportunity.
[02:38:52.721 --> 02:38:58.827]  And again, I'm not against fiat currencies, if they're private, public, transparent, and have somewhat of a history.
[02:38:58.847 --> 02:39:01.330]  And I get, well, it has to have a history by being born.
[02:39:01.690 --> 02:39:02.151]  Exactly.
[02:39:02.191 --> 02:39:05.133]  And the globalists will want to strangle these little babies.
[02:39:05.914 --> 02:39:11.258]  Uh, in the crib, or at least give them an injection to dumb them down, uh, so they won't be troubled.
[02:39:11.278 --> 02:39:16.803]  It's kind of like a lion killing baby male lions, or a grizzly killing baby, uh, male grizzlies.
[02:39:16.823 --> 02:39:18.604]  You know, the globalists do this to you now.
[02:39:18.644 --> 02:39:24.869]  They make sure the boys are brain damaged, so you won't give them any trouble before the big robot rollout and soft kill operation.
[02:39:25.209 --> 02:39:29.292]  So Mike Adams of Natural News pops in to get, he's a smart business guy, uh,
[02:39:30.553 --> 02:39:33.176]  On many fronts, I tend to respect his opinion.
[02:39:33.196 --> 02:39:33.957]  Well, I don't tend to.
[02:39:34.057 --> 02:39:36.159]  I haven't found anything I disagree with Mike Adams on.
[02:39:36.580 --> 02:39:37.421]  That's rare to say.
[02:39:37.441 --> 02:39:40.644]  I disagree with myself more half the time listening to rebroadcasts than I do with him.
[02:39:40.964 --> 02:39:49.653]  Mike, what is your take on this and why are you saying the Bitcoin bubble by speculative Bitcoin buy-ins now point to a disastrous Bitcoin crash?
[02:39:49.974 --> 02:39:51.596]  Mike Adams of NaturalNews.com.
[02:39:52.176 --> 02:40:00.838]  Hi Alex, thanks for having me on, and I'm glad you pointed out that we both are supporters of a decentralized peer-to-peer cryptocurrency in theory.
[02:40:01.198 --> 02:40:02.218]  The idea is wonderful.
[02:40:02.258 --> 02:40:04.418]  We need competition for the central banks.
[02:40:04.839 --> 02:40:07.899]  So I'm not anti-Bitcoin, and I want to be very, very clear about that.
[02:40:07.919 --> 02:40:09.139]  In fact, we promoted it.
[02:40:09.760 --> 02:40:11.640]  I mean, our store even accepts Bitcoins.
[02:40:11.680 --> 02:40:17.441]  You know, we want people in Bitcoins overall, but what's happening now is it has converted.
[02:40:17.761 --> 02:40:20.102]  It's become too popular too quickly.
[02:40:20.222 --> 02:40:21.742]  It has become a mania.
[02:40:22.082 --> 02:40:24.143]  By the way, you know I privately predicted that to you.
[02:40:24.683 --> 02:40:25.043]  You did.
[02:40:25.263 --> 02:40:25.883]  Yes, you did.
[02:40:26.224 --> 02:40:27.344]  You're exactly right on.
[02:40:27.364 --> 02:40:28.845]  But I smell something here.
[02:40:29.725 --> 02:40:34.727]  Well, it could be that it's just people jumping on board.
[02:40:34.747 --> 02:40:35.367]  I mean, we're seeing this.
[02:40:35.387 --> 02:40:41.009]  You know, we have an office in Asia, and we've been getting inside reports that in China now, this is the new casino.
[02:40:41.409 --> 02:40:44.691]  Buy bitcoins, ride it, you know, buy it low and sell it high.
[02:40:45.051 --> 02:40:47.532]  This is a speculative bubble in the making.
[02:40:48.032 --> 02:40:50.173]  It doesn't mean it's going to crash tomorrow.
[02:40:50.633 --> 02:40:52.473]  It may still go much, much higher.
[02:40:52.533 --> 02:40:56.434]  It could reach 500, it could reach 1,000, even $10,000 a Bitcoin.
[02:40:56.834 --> 02:41:00.195]  But eventually, it's going to crash hard.
[02:41:00.715 --> 02:41:03.056]  And I bet my reputation on that, Alex.
[02:41:03.216 --> 02:41:12.558]  I am 100% sure we're going to see a massive Bitcoin crash at some point with an ultra-accelerated velocity of the crash.
[02:41:12.998 --> 02:41:16.799]  It will be the fastest crash of any currency in the history of human civilization.
[02:41:17.239 --> 02:41:21.381]  And there are mathematical reasons for that that I've tried to lay out in the story that I just published.
[02:41:21.621 --> 02:41:22.821]  I think it's up on InfoWars.
[02:41:23.441 --> 02:41:25.102]  But it will be a high-velocity crash.
[02:41:25.562 --> 02:41:31.704]  The reason is because people are buying bitcoins who don't know what bitcoins are and who have no use for them.
[02:41:32.486 --> 02:41:33.527]  These are speculators.
[02:41:33.787 --> 02:41:40.970]  They're buying bitcoins in the same way that people bought tulip bulbs in the tulip bulb mania of, I think, 1637.
[02:41:41.731 --> 02:41:51.916]  It's going to be the same thing, it's just a new vehicle, and it's going to crash bitcoins eventually, at which point they will become a good value to buy once the crash has happened, Alex.
[02:41:53.817 --> 02:41:55.738]  Go over some more of the mathematics for people.
[02:41:56.946 --> 02:42:07.149]  Alright, well, everybody who's holding bitcoins right now believes that their bitcoins are worth $200, $210, because that's the latest market price for the bitcoins.
[02:42:07.669 --> 02:42:15.452]  So there has been literally hundreds of millions of dollars in valuation that has been artificially created by the ramp-up in bitcoin prices.
[02:42:15.932 --> 02:42:22.654]  So everyone who holds bitcoins thinks all their bitcoins are worth that, and in a grand total, it's well over a billion dollars.
[02:42:23.374 --> 02:42:31.078]  In truth, though, once a sell-off begins, the greed that is currently pushing the market upwards will transition into fear.
[02:42:31.679 --> 02:42:33.159]  The price support will falter.
[02:42:33.780 --> 02:42:35.280]  The fear will start a sell-off.
[02:42:35.781 --> 02:42:40.443]  The sell-off will start to devalue the holdings that current people have in bitcoins.
[02:42:41.064 --> 02:42:43.665]  Once they see their money dropping down, they're going to start selling.
[02:42:43.865 --> 02:42:44.185]  That's right.
[02:42:44.225 --> 02:42:45.726]  Slow growth is always the healthiest.
[02:42:45.766 --> 02:42:48.948]  When something goes straight up like an Atlas rocket, it's going to go
[02:42:49.588 --> 02:43:11.655]  It's going to go straight down, and you already see them putting money laundering rules onto it, just preparing to try to then outlaw any competing digital currency, because the globalists are actually going to go themselves on record to a global SDR, backed up by carbon taxes, wellhead taxes, and money transfer Tobin taxes, so they will try to strangle this in the crib.
[02:43:11.956 --> 02:43:15.957]  They may even be pumping money into it, so that they can then dump it later.
[02:43:15.977 --> 02:43:19.118]  I mean, if they didn't, look, I think like the enemy.
[02:43:19.338 --> 02:43:20.559]  If I was the enemy, I'd do that.
[02:43:21.419 --> 02:43:21.740]  Exactly.
[02:43:21.780 --> 02:43:44.776]  The central banks would be very smart right now to be buying bitcoins, pushing it up, making it very, very popular, getting as many people on board as possible, and then, when the timing is right, do a mass sell-off of bitcoins, flood the marketplace with massive supply of bitcoins, causing a crash, causing bitcoins to be discredited so that no one ever trusts a decentralized, non-government-run currency again.
[02:43:45.296 --> 02:43:46.617]  That's the brilliant
[02:43:46.997 --> 02:43:53.180]  Evil tactic of the central bankers who we know are deeply engaged in psychological warfare and market manipulations.
[02:43:53.520 --> 02:43:55.081]  So I think they are involved right now.
[02:43:56.662 --> 02:43:57.882]  I'm going to get to some other news with you.
[02:43:57.902 --> 02:43:58.903]  I want to get your take on here.
[02:43:58.983 --> 02:44:03.805]  North Korea, Obama bugging the phones through Mother Jones.
[02:44:03.825 --> 02:44:07.407]  That's basically a White House front of Congress.
[02:44:07.447 --> 02:44:08.347]  I mean, of course they are.
[02:44:08.387 --> 02:44:09.548]  That's what the NSA is for.
[02:44:10.248 --> 02:44:11.629]  I want to talk about that with you in a moment.
[02:44:12.269 --> 02:44:14.350]  But first off, any other points you want to make about Bitcoin?
[02:44:15.353 --> 02:44:18.755]  Well, just remember that right now what's driving the Bitcoin market is greed.
[02:44:19.095 --> 02:44:21.376]  The idea that you can buy low and sell high.
[02:44:21.776 --> 02:44:34.782]  Greed will turn to fear, as it has always done, Alex, in the tulip bulb bubble, in the dot-com bubble, that I also publicly predicted that it was going to crash two years before it did, and I know you did as well, and in the housing bubble.
[02:44:35.162 --> 02:44:37.984]  Every bubble in history has the same psychological profile.
[02:44:38.524 --> 02:44:40.306]  Eventually, greed will turn to fear.
[02:44:40.666 --> 02:44:41.787]  Fear will turn to panic.
[02:44:42.228 --> 02:44:50.216]  And remember that the Wall Street stock markets, they have limits of how quickly a stock can drop in a day.
[02:44:50.536 --> 02:44:53.279]  They will close the market if it limits down too much.
[02:44:53.339 --> 02:44:56.202]  So you have a limit down and a cooling off period overnight.
[02:44:56.683 --> 02:44:58.324]  Bitcoin has no limits.
[02:44:58.885 --> 02:45:00.065]  There's no cooling period.
[02:45:00.385 --> 02:45:06.848]  That's why when the crash begins, it will be the most rapid, high-velocity crash of any currency in history.
[02:45:07.188 --> 02:45:08.028]  That's going to happen.
[02:45:08.268 --> 02:45:09.288]  It's just a matter of when.
[02:45:10.009 --> 02:45:11.749]  Oh, and one more important point, Alex.
[02:45:12.289 --> 02:45:22.233]  There are some very, very smart people who are going to get very rich off of this, who have built in algorithms to sell Bitcoin when it drops below a certain fixed market value.
[02:45:22.773 --> 02:45:25.594]  It's an automated, you know, computerized selling system.
[02:45:26.394 --> 02:45:28.316]  They're going to make money because they'll be able to get out.
[02:45:28.657 --> 02:45:35.745]  But the result of that system is that it will accelerate the downward spiral of prices faster than most humans can respond.
[02:45:36.246 --> 02:45:43.194]  You're going to see the Bitcoin exchanges overloaded during the crash and people won't be able to get out until the value is... What's your gut tell you?
[02:45:44.155 --> 02:45:52.248]  Because they've been having some minor glitches, I think, to train people to stay in when it finally mega plunges, to deliver the maximum profit to the insiders.
[02:45:52.268 --> 02:45:57.836]  I mean, is it possible that Bitcoin could have been created by the system itself?
[02:45:59.073 --> 02:46:00.673]  My gut tells me that it wasn't.
[02:46:00.754 --> 02:46:10.056]  I think it was probably created by some libertarian-minded mathematicians who, by the way, right now are billionaires, for sure.
[02:46:10.816 --> 02:46:15.558]  But it can be manipulated by the central banks and the system, and I think it is being manipulated.
[02:46:15.858 --> 02:46:23.140]  And my gut tells me that this may go considerably higher still, but the higher it goes, the worse the crash is going to be.
[02:46:23.900 --> 02:46:27.602]  And the ultimate goal is to discredit Bitcoin, which I am against.
[02:46:27.742 --> 02:46:29.764]  I'm a proponent of this crypto currency.
[02:46:29.784 --> 02:46:32.105]  Absolutely, but the operatives will spin it that we're against it.
[02:46:32.465 --> 02:46:33.906]  Okay, I want to shift gears with you.
[02:46:34.166 --> 02:46:35.887]  You've got a lot of contacts in Asia, I know.
[02:46:36.588 --> 02:46:38.289]  I've never seen rhetoric like this.
[02:46:38.349 --> 02:46:39.790]  Korea saying they're going to blow up Japan.
[02:46:40.390 --> 02:46:47.293]  South Korea and the U.S., obviously can't hit the U.S., may be able to hit Japan or South Korea, obviously, with their artillery, 10,000 plus pieces, no doubt.
[02:46:48.074 --> 02:46:55.337]  I mean, the perfect example of a collapsing psychopath with a bunch of weapons who can't even tie their shoelaces but have weapons, because that's all they need.
[02:46:55.377 --> 02:46:56.738]  They want the guns, the people don't.
[02:46:56.758 --> 02:46:58.218]  You know, that's why Obama wants the guns.
[02:46:58.659 --> 02:47:01.080]  Threatening South Korea, that's just an exploding
[02:47:01.940 --> 02:47:04.503]  Fastest growing economy in the world undoubtedly.
[02:47:04.523 --> 02:47:10.190]  I mean this is unprecedented saying we're loading the missiles tomorrow and you know saying things like and you will be destroyed.
[02:47:10.211 --> 02:47:11.853]  I mean this is unprecedented.
[02:47:13.066 --> 02:47:25.254]  Well, as we talked about when I was, I guess, there in studio last week with you, I believe that America has the right at this point, the moral justification, to go ahead and strike North Korea's leadership.
[02:47:25.354 --> 02:47:30.738]  And we're always anti-war, because we're not for invading Iraq that's done nothing, or putting Al-Qaeda and Libyan Sharia.
[02:47:30.898 --> 02:47:34.600]  When somebody says, I have nukes, they're aimed, I'm going to launch them on you, boom!
[02:47:34.800 --> 02:47:35.461]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:47:36.101 --> 02:47:38.222]  But we have to make sure if that happens.
[02:47:38.282 --> 02:47:46.804]  And this is the one case in which I absolutely agree with the Pentagon to go in and do, you might call it a preemptive strike, but it's really a self-defense strike.
[02:47:47.164 --> 02:47:48.644]  I believe in the right to self-defense.
[02:47:48.984 --> 02:47:57.586]  I believe in that right for school teachers at schools, for individuals carrying handguns, and for nations to defend themselves against tyrants who are threatening to strike them with nuclear weapons.
[02:47:57.967 --> 02:47:59.787]  It's the same philosophy just at a larger scale.
[02:47:59.787 --> 02:48:02.229]  And China has backed off North Korea and told them to stop it.
[02:48:02.489 --> 02:48:09.954]  I mean, I think they should tell them one more threat to nuke Japan or South Korea or us, and I mean, just to decapitate his government.
[02:48:10.254 --> 02:48:12.816]  I mean, they've got all the weapons, but they don't want to show those.
[02:48:13.496 --> 02:48:16.479]  I mean, but they can decapitate them with the meteor guns right now.
[02:48:17.563 --> 02:48:27.426]  And what we need to do is go in there, wipe out the corrupt criminal North Korean leadership, and deliver something resembling democracy to that country.
[02:48:27.466 --> 02:48:35.188]  I know it's kind of hypocrisy since America seems to be abandoning democracy, but at least don't the people of North Korea deserve something resembling freedom?
[02:48:35.208 --> 02:48:36.729]  It's such an example of pure evil.
[02:48:37.029 --> 02:48:42.811]  That's why our government gave them the reactors in the mid-90s to make the A-bombs, because our government's just as bad.
[02:48:42.831 --> 02:48:46.432]  It's just they had richer people to build an empire off of.
[02:48:47.494 --> 02:48:48.155]  Well, exactly.
[02:48:48.435 --> 02:48:54.547]  But if there were ever a case, a moral case, for freeing people from enslavement through the use of military force, this is it.
[02:48:54.767 --> 02:48:55.769]  And that's why they won't do it.
[02:48:55.809 --> 02:48:56.630]  And that's why they won't do it.
[02:48:57.705 --> 02:48:59.266]  Obama loves Mao Zedong.
[02:48:59.986 --> 02:49:01.207]  This is a Maoist state.
[02:49:01.247 --> 02:49:03.748]  I mean, absolutely, he would love to set things up like this.
[02:49:03.768 --> 02:49:08.630]  Yeah, they're probably getting ideas from Kim Jong-un of how to run Washington next.
[02:49:09.510 --> 02:49:12.651]  Let me raise another issue here with you.
[02:49:13.472 --> 02:49:17.854]  What do you think of the family having to flee to Cuba with their kids away from America?
[02:49:18.334 --> 02:49:20.275]  The evil parents that kidnapped their own kids.
[02:49:21.115 --> 02:49:22.955]  Yeah, well, we're seeing many examples of this.
[02:49:22.995 --> 02:49:26.996]  There's a homeschooling family from Germany that's also facing deportation.
[02:49:27.416 --> 02:49:30.037]  Look, parental rights are completely under assault.
[02:49:30.077 --> 02:49:40.099]  In fact, Paul Watson ran a story there on InfoWars, I think yesterday, about the collectivist mindset that MSNBC hosts, saying your kids are not your kids.
[02:49:40.599 --> 02:49:41.760]  The parent is the state.
[02:49:42.220 --> 02:49:43.160]  It is a collective
[02:49:43.920 --> 02:49:46.882]  A mommy and daddy now that's raising and owning your children.
[02:49:47.303 --> 02:49:49.604]  This is getting very, very dangerous, Alex.
[02:49:49.624 --> 02:49:51.366]  It's not just the assault on the Second Amendment.
[02:49:51.806 --> 02:49:54.027]  It's the assault on individualism.
[02:49:54.087 --> 02:49:55.969]  It's the assault on parenting.
[02:49:55.989 --> 02:49:56.789]  It is.
[02:49:57.650 --> 02:49:58.571]  What is moonshine?
[02:49:58.591 --> 02:49:58.891]  200 proof?
[02:49:58.951 --> 02:49:59.752]  It's pure alcohol.
[02:50:00.072 --> 02:50:02.434]  This is 200 proof tyranny.
[02:50:02.494 --> 02:50:07.737]  I mean, what they're trying to do, what they're hiding in plain view, it'd be like your neighbor walking in
[02:50:08.778 --> 02:50:12.582]  Shooting you in the leg and then raping your wife in front of him and the police show up and give him a medal.
[02:50:13.182 --> 02:50:16.185]  I mean, it's such evil ideas, so proven to be evil.
[02:50:16.545 --> 02:50:20.949]  Verified authoritarianism just stomping around in front of us.
[02:50:21.229 --> 02:50:23.511]  What do you think of pimping out the dead kids, Obama?
[02:50:23.832 --> 02:50:24.853]  I mean, these people are sick.
[02:50:25.595 --> 02:50:33.900]  Well, look at the traitors in Connecticut, the members of the State Senate and the State House who voted for all of those infringements on the Second Amendment.
[02:50:34.241 --> 02:50:37.303]  Those people, Alex, swore to defend the oath.
[02:50:37.543 --> 02:50:47.429]  They swore an oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic, and they themselves have proven that they are the enemies of America, the domestic enemies.
[02:50:48.250 --> 02:50:49.050]  There's no doubt.
[02:50:49.110 --> 02:50:49.771]  I mean, listen, listen.
[02:50:50.511 --> 02:50:53.914]  If they were really Americans in doing this, they'd be occupiers, revolutionaries.
[02:50:54.634 --> 02:50:55.354]  Bring in tyranny.
[02:50:55.835 --> 02:50:57.815]  But they work for foreign mega banks.
[02:50:57.855 --> 02:51:00.016]  They're open foreign mercenaries.
[02:51:00.316 --> 02:51:02.017]  I mean, I'm not just saying that for rhetoric.
[02:51:02.297 --> 02:51:03.517]  That's the new world order.
[02:51:03.978 --> 02:51:05.078]  Naturalnews.com.
[02:51:05.218 --> 02:51:06.158]  Mike Adams, thank you so much.
[02:51:06.179 --> 02:51:06.999]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[02:51:07.339 --> 02:51:07.759]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:51:07.899 --> 02:51:08.719]  Final News Blitz.
[02:51:08.739 --> 02:51:09.260]  Straight ahead.
[02:51:09.300 --> 02:51:09.720]  Stay with us.
[02:51:10.160 --> 02:51:11.320]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:51:11.580 --> 02:51:22.024]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[02:51:22.264 --> 02:51:29.166]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats, but we can't do that without your help.
[02:51:29.466 --> 02:51:36.968]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at InfoWars.com, you will wake up people in your area and support
[02:51:37.328 --> 02:51:40.289]  Our operation as we move to the next level.
[02:51:40.729 --> 02:51:44.010]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[02:51:44.210 --> 02:51:49.851]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[02:51:50.351 --> 02:51:59.854]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[02:52:00.254 --> 02:52:01.434]  The war is here.
[02:52:01.754 --> 02:52:03.075]  It's an info war.
[02:52:03.695 --> 02:52:09.419]  The Spirit of 1776 versus the Mindset of 1984.
[02:52:09.920 --> 02:52:12.642]  Do you suffer from low-functioning adrenal or thyroid gland?
[02:52:12.842 --> 02:52:18.587]  Did you know that mercury from your dental fillings comes off your teeth both as a vapor and as metal particles into your body?
[02:52:18.687 --> 02:52:22.450]  Wherever mercury deposits in your body, it stops cells from functioning normally.
[02:52:22.690 --> 02:52:25.512]  Animal studies show that mercury causes kidney function to drop by 60%.
[02:52:26.613 --> 02:52:26.993]  I don't know.

[02:53:14.651 --> 02:53:16.773]  I want you to know some very important information.
[02:53:17.673 --> 02:53:26.019]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[02:53:26.639 --> 02:53:31.543]  Now, 27 years later, carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

[02:54:06.390 --> 02:54:07.390]  Protect your immune system.
[02:54:07.670 --> 02:54:08.711]  It's the only one you've got.
[02:54:16.107 --> 02:54:18.688]  Let's take a look at Drugs Report right now, then we'll go over to InfoWars.com.
[02:54:18.708 --> 02:54:21.990]  There's a lot of new news up on both sites, also on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:54:22.290 --> 02:54:22.750]  Look at this.
[02:54:23.470 --> 02:54:25.431]  Nixon tactics declared.
[02:54:25.451 --> 02:54:29.613]  FBI asked to investigate.
[02:54:31.514 --> 02:54:38.097]  And Mitch McConnell's wondering how Mother Jones has recordings of them inside their private office buildings.
[02:54:38.497 --> 02:54:44.960]  Because Mother Jones and Media Matters and MSNBC are all Democratic Party White House run.
[02:54:45.922 --> 02:54:48.043]  And as bad as Mitch McConnell is, he's not.
[02:54:48.584 --> 02:54:56.628]  Total New World Order, butcher everything, kill babies up to age three, the states, the mommy and daddy, you know, total tyranny, bankrupt everything.
[02:54:57.589 --> 02:55:01.891]  And there's a whole Tea Party wing trying to take the Republicans over right now, so the globalists just want them out of there.
[02:55:02.172 --> 02:55:03.973]  And of course they're bugging everything.
[02:55:05.073 --> 02:55:08.936]  The Media Matters talks about how they'll get into media organizations and quote, bring them down.
[02:55:09.356 --> 02:55:11.597]  These are spy organizations of foreign banks.
[02:55:11.637 --> 02:55:12.398]  These aren't liberals.
[02:55:15.885 --> 02:55:17.367]  Nixon tactics declared?
[02:55:17.407 --> 02:55:21.993]  I mean, Nixon had some FBI files, had some files, IRS files.
[02:55:22.353 --> 02:55:25.958]  They now digitize all your files and give them to every agency out there.
[02:55:28.181 --> 02:55:29.583]  Nixonian tactics.
[02:55:29.643 --> 02:55:31.566]  I mean, Nixon was nothing compared to these people.
[02:55:32.918 --> 02:55:37.021]  And again, I'm sure if we get a Republican in down the road who's a globalist, it'll be worse than Obama.
[02:55:37.361 --> 02:55:38.822]  It's just that this is how tyranny works.
[02:55:38.882 --> 02:55:41.163]  It gets worse and worse and worse.
[02:55:41.183 --> 02:55:41.563]  Look at this.
[02:55:42.304 --> 02:55:45.486]  Quake hits near Iran's nuclear Bashar facility.
[02:55:45.566 --> 02:55:48.147]  Ahmadinejad orders launch of five new reactors.

[02:55:48.728 --> 02:55:52.450]  Navy deploying laser weapon near Iran.
[02:55:52.470 --> 02:55:54.491]  We've got video of that up on Infowars.com.
[02:55:54.831 --> 02:55:55.552]  Report U.S.
[02:55:55.592 --> 02:55:57.293]  held secret meetings with North Korea in March.
[02:55:58.647 --> 02:56:00.868]  Well, that's, you know, our government gave them the reactors.
[02:56:01.448 --> 02:56:02.729]  South Korea and China don't like this.
[02:56:02.749 --> 02:56:05.230]  You know, have you ever thought Kim Jong-un may be working for the globalists?
[02:56:05.950 --> 02:56:07.151]  I don't think that's far-fetched.
[02:56:07.171 --> 02:56:07.971]  They gave them reactors.
[02:56:08.031 --> 02:56:09.892]  I bet that's why he's acting so crazy.
[02:56:11.393 --> 02:56:14.854]  That's what Pachenek was hinting at, that this was all a psy-op.
[02:56:15.574 --> 02:56:18.676]  North Korea to launch, our government put the Mulas in, in Iran, did you know that?
[02:56:19.116 --> 02:56:20.837]  North Korea to launch a missile tomorrow.
[02:56:21.737 --> 02:56:23.898]  Warns foreigners to leave South Korea.
[02:56:25.618 --> 02:56:28.300]  Another White House party paid for by taxpayers.
[02:56:31.322 --> 02:56:32.343]  It just goes on and on.
[02:56:32.363 --> 02:56:35.625]  Yeah, we just showed video of a laser.
[02:56:35.665 --> 02:56:36.266]  Show that again.
[02:56:36.286 --> 02:56:38.607]  A laser shooting down a drone.
[02:56:40.649 --> 02:56:42.470]  Star Wars, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:56:43.231 --> 02:56:45.212]  I'm going to release a laser video here very, very soon.
[02:56:45.272 --> 02:56:45.793]  It'll blow you away.
[02:56:45.813 --> 02:56:46.433]  Look at that laser.
[02:56:46.893 --> 02:56:47.614]  That's a little one.
[02:56:48.174 --> 02:56:50.336]  They've got them that are like five times that size in DC-10s.
[02:56:50.476 --> 02:56:54.299]  And that's all they need to actually
[02:56:57.150 --> 02:57:00.613]  Be able to... Somebody's out there banging on the door.
[02:57:02.315 --> 02:57:04.257]  By the way... Oh, they're building a studio.
[02:57:04.577 --> 02:57:05.258]  That's so funny.
[02:57:07.260 --> 02:57:08.100]  Oh, it doesn't even matter.
[02:57:08.140 --> 02:57:08.841]  It doesn't even matter.
[02:57:09.261 --> 02:57:10.423]  There's just so much other news.
[02:57:10.443 --> 02:57:13.806]  Let's look at... Let's look at InfoWars.com here.
[02:57:13.846 --> 02:57:18.810]  Some of the stories that just broke over at InfoWars.com for everybody.
[02:57:20.252 --> 02:57:21.113]  Here on the main page.
[02:57:23.120 --> 02:57:27.204]  Gosnell Worker heard babies screaming during live birth abortion.
[02:57:27.224 --> 02:57:27.684]  Well, why not?
[02:57:27.724 --> 02:57:28.605]  Kill them up to age three.
[02:57:28.665 --> 02:57:29.446]  The state owns the kids.
[02:57:29.466 --> 02:57:30.107]  They say kill them.
[02:57:30.427 --> 02:57:30.987]  That's liberal.
[02:57:31.708 --> 02:57:32.309]  Peace Prize.
[02:57:32.889 --> 02:57:34.110]  Give a Peace Prize to the abortionists.
[02:57:34.531 --> 02:57:39.916]  MSNBC host turns to Jesus in response to criticism of her collectivization rant.
[02:57:40.737 --> 02:57:42.278]  Promises to love her enemies.
[02:57:42.318 --> 02:57:43.840]  Yeah, well, you buy two billion bullets.
[02:57:45.014 --> 02:57:45.935]  This is not an attack.
[02:57:45.955 --> 02:57:46.715]  This is not an assault.
[02:57:46.755 --> 02:57:47.196]  Don't run.
[02:57:47.236 --> 02:57:47.976]  We are your friends.
[02:57:48.897 --> 02:57:53.100]  Time columnists warning others about government oppression is anti-American crap.
[02:57:53.500 --> 02:57:55.461]  See, they're scared of us talking about their oppression.
[02:57:55.681 --> 02:57:57.623]  They're scared of us talking about their secret police.
[02:57:57.863 --> 02:58:00.004]  They don't want us to have a debate that they're arming against us.
[02:58:00.305 --> 02:58:01.986]  They're scared of what we cover here.
[02:58:03.635 --> 02:58:06.157]  Big CIS test drones that can detect guns.
[02:58:06.197 --> 02:58:07.078]  There it is confirmed.
[02:58:07.098 --> 02:58:08.459]  That is a big story that deserves.
[02:58:08.479 --> 02:58:13.842]  In fact, I'm going to have that red link, because first off, they showed a Homeland Security training video that showed, you know, them targeting gun owners.
[02:58:13.862 --> 02:58:15.303]  They're like, oh no, we don't plan that.
[02:58:15.584 --> 02:58:19.607]  This is domestic drones on local Oklahoma City news admitted for gun owners.
[02:58:21.308 --> 02:58:24.870]  And of course, the big one that was up on Drudge Report, now at Infowars.com.

[02:58:39.821 --> 02:58:43.602]  Yeah, when they did those payoffs at the Capitol, they rolled out black folks playing the race card.
[02:58:43.902 --> 02:58:45.483]  Look, scary black people, turn your guns in.
[02:58:45.723 --> 02:58:47.484]  They're the real racists, the race pimps.
[02:58:47.684 --> 02:58:50.766]  They're out-of-control eugenicists scum who want to murder you and your family.
[02:58:50.786 --> 02:58:51.526]  And I'm not joking.
[02:58:51.726 --> 02:58:53.467]  They say kill babies up to age three.
[02:58:53.687 --> 02:58:54.167]  Wake up.
[02:58:54.507 --> 02:58:56.368]  They hope your normalcy bias blocks you.
[02:58:56.629 --> 02:58:57.889]  Most of the nightly news tonight.
[02:58:58.089 --> 02:58:59.050]  It's big, too.
