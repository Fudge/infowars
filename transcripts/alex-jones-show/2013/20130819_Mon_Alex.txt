[00:00:06.462 --> 00:00:10.646]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:11.306 --> 00:00:12.107]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.888 --> 00:00:13.808]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:18.032]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.633 --> 00:00:22.696]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:46.709]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, the Muslim Brotherhood, or Al-Qaeda's granddaddy, is parading nuns that they've captured from burnout Catholic churches in the streets of Cairo.
[00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:57.017]  And our controlled media here in the United States is the only media in the world that is actually siding with the Muslim Brotherhood.
[00:00:57.718 --> 00:01:02.742]  Absolutely incredible, because they will destabilize that region, and that is the game plan.
[00:01:03.669 --> 00:01:13.675]  Islamist mob parades nuns in Cairo as prisoners of war after six hours looting church school and replacing cross with banner resembling Al Qaeda flag.
[00:01:15.015 --> 00:01:16.656]  Absolutely, that's out of the Daily Mail.
[00:01:16.716 --> 00:01:19.358]  It's up on DrudgeReport.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:01:19.978 --> 00:01:26.482]  Speaking of what's up on InfoWars.com, I'll tell you about that coming up in the next segment and I'm going to just open the phones up today.
[00:01:27.022 --> 00:01:32.245]  Not that I don't have literally over a hundred news articles here that all need to be covered and we will get into all of that.
[00:01:33.527 --> 00:01:47.219]  We've got Dr. Russell Blaylock joining us to get into now the fact that Obamacare is being implemented, everything he warned people about is unfolding, and you've got masses of doctors retiring to get away from this nightmare.
[00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:51.162]  We'll also get his take on Coca-Cola running ads saying aspartame
[00:01:51.903 --> 00:01:52.343]  I don't think so.
[00:02:12.093 --> 00:02:14.055]  We also have another article here on London Independent.
[00:02:14.095 --> 00:02:19.120]  Rupert Murdoch buys into alternative media with a $70 million slice of Vice.
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.282]  I remember five years ago when Vice started.
[00:02:21.322 --> 00:02:22.423]  They first came and interviewed us.
[00:02:22.963 --> 00:02:23.504]  Two guys.
[00:02:24.224 --> 00:02:29.910]  And because they cover trendy news, along with conspiracies, they're now one of the hottest things out there.
[00:02:31.033 --> 00:02:37.336]  And I've never really gone this path, though when I have done it occasionally, it's been quite successful.
[00:02:38.137 --> 00:02:44.239]  And I think that, I mean, I told the guys like five years ago this was the case, but we just haven't really done it.
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:51.783]  We need to hijack popular culture more, but then infuse liberty information into it.
[00:02:52.564 --> 00:02:54.124]  And I'm saying this to the whole liberty movement.
[00:02:55.685 --> 00:02:59.027]  Instead of just, hey, let's go show people drilling holes in their heads for fun, or
[00:02:59.758 --> 00:03:06.204]  You know, people taking an amnesic drug to, uh, uh, or giving people amnesic drugs to rob them.
[00:03:06.224 --> 00:03:10.067]  I mean, that's old news, but people like Vice take it and make it new news.
[00:03:10.567 --> 00:03:11.948]  What's old news is new news.
[00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.090]  What's interesting news is important.
[00:03:14.431 --> 00:03:15.472]  But then inject...
[00:03:17.048 --> 00:03:26.637]  I would take an article about scopolamine and say, but what about other giving scopolamine to the troops after they carried out operations to not remember what they did in massacres?
[00:03:27.158 --> 00:03:28.118]  A form of mind control.
[00:03:28.158 --> 00:03:31.321]  Or what about how they're giving them halcyon, another amnesia.
[00:03:31.362 --> 00:03:37.748]  See, that's how my brain works, is take something popular that's admitted and then tie it to
[00:03:39.611 --> 00:03:43.913]  Not just A, B, C, D, E, F, G, but right down to Z to get people thinking.
[00:03:44.373 --> 00:03:46.654]  And doing stuff like Adon Salazar did today.
[00:03:47.194 --> 00:03:49.896]  Glenn Danzig, popular icon of heavy metal.
[00:03:50.776 --> 00:03:53.317]  Kind of the Dark Elvis character.
[00:03:55.518 --> 00:03:57.139]  Very poetic, also very dark.
[00:03:57.479 --> 00:04:01.681]  Glenn Danzig, Democrats are fascists disguised as liberals.
[00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:06.573]  And he goes on to say how creepy it is that Obama kills whoever he wants and is really just a fascist.
[00:04:06.993 --> 00:04:08.775]  See, that's an important article.
[00:04:09.055 --> 00:04:13.980]  Now Adon Salazar has written an article, Glenn Danzig condemns Obama's drone policies.
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:15.361]  Shubheadline!
[00:04:16.702 --> 00:04:17.523]  Shubheadline!
[00:04:20.346 --> 00:04:24.370]  Right there in the article says the Democrats are
[00:04:25.609 --> 00:04:28.190]  Fascists posing as liberals, because that's exactly what they are.
[00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.132]  And when Republicans act like fascists, we should point that out.
[00:04:31.172 --> 00:04:38.615]  But just because you've got... I mean, when guys wearing upside-down crosses are telling you Obama's bad, you know you're in trouble.
[00:04:39.416 --> 00:04:44.198]  When we've got... We've got... When the devil's telling you Obama's bad, look out.
[00:04:44.799 --> 00:04:46.399]  Even the devil thinks he's bad.
[00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:53.503]  I mean, even... Even Oliver Stone's come out and said the man's a snake, you gotta turn on him.
[00:04:54.943 --> 00:04:55.809]  It's getting crazy.
[00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.674]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:56.735 --> 00:04:57.138]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.761 --> 00:05:03.382]  Introducing Pro-1.

[00:07:01.815 --> 00:07:05.096]  Every three seconds, someone becomes a victim of identity theft.
[00:07:05.396 --> 00:07:09.477]  We also hear news stories every day about the NSA spying on U.S.

[00:08:10.277 --> 00:08:15.441]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:16.622 --> 00:08:17.543]  Mother!
[00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:26.185]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live on this Monday edition of the 19th day of August.
[00:08:43.606 --> 00:08:47.128]  2013.
[00:08:44.406 --> 00:08:47.128]  Blasting out across the United States and worldwide.
[00:08:47.568 --> 00:08:58.736]  You are tuned in to the number one pro-liberty, anti-New World Order transmission on the face of the planet terra firma.
[00:08:59.156 --> 00:09:00.998]  And I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:09:01.298 --> 00:09:03.139]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:09:03.319 --> 00:09:08.383]  Dr. Russell Blaylock on the nightmare that is Obamacare and on Coca-Cola.
[00:09:09.639 --> 00:09:14.041]  Coming out with nationwide print ads saying that Aspartame isn't bad for you.
[00:09:14.081 --> 00:09:24.124]  He's going to be popping in, Max Keiser, on the huge developments in the world economy and what an increase in global interest rates are going to mean on a whole host of issues.
[00:09:24.244 --> 00:09:25.985]  That is coming up today.
[00:09:27.449 --> 00:09:42.852]  We're also seeing a lot of bizarre behavior going on out there, where you've got Time Magazine reporters coming out and saying he can't wait to see Julian Assange killed by a drone strike.
[00:09:43.593 --> 00:09:47.594]  That report's up on DrudgeReport.com on the left-hand side at the bottom.
[00:09:47.614 --> 00:09:50.595]  You can also find it at InfoWars.com.
[00:09:51.435 --> 00:10:01.478]  And we're going to be getting into today, after I take some phone calls, and I covered this a lot yesterday on the Sunday Show, but there's been new developments since then.
[00:10:02.678 --> 00:10:05.041]  Egyptian unrest threatens oil routes.
[00:10:05.061 --> 00:10:06.543]  The Suez Canal ambush.
[00:10:06.583 --> 00:10:09.826]  Militants kill 25 Egyptian policemen in Sinai.
[00:10:09.866 --> 00:10:11.368]  CNN calls them protesters.
[00:10:11.828 --> 00:10:13.470]  Yeah, when they kill people, it's called protesting.
[00:10:14.211 --> 00:10:16.534]  Officials said to order release of Mubarak.
[00:10:18.286 --> 00:10:22.249]  Saudi King backs Egyptian military against their own jihadis.
[00:10:22.749 --> 00:10:25.051]  Report dozens killed in attempt to escape custody.
[00:10:25.391 --> 00:10:28.873]  Christian homes and shops marked with red graffiti before attack.
[00:10:29.253 --> 00:10:31.415]  More than 45 churches burned this weekend.
[00:10:31.695 --> 00:10:33.256]  They've burned 60 in the last month.
[00:10:33.576 --> 00:10:35.838]  Islamist mob parades a nun in Cairo.
[00:10:36.438 --> 00:10:38.780]  Nuns as prisoners of war.
[00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:41.341]  McCain, US has no credibility in Arab world.
[00:10:41.462 --> 00:10:42.022]  I love that!
[00:10:42.402 --> 00:10:47.826]  When McCain has been a cheerleader for getting rid of Hazem Mubarak and putting in the Muslim Brotherhood.
[00:10:48.727 --> 00:10:50.709]  I love how these guys help engineer the crisis.
[00:10:51.249 --> 00:11:03.902]  Our media, the globalist, kleptocrat, prostitute media, Decepticon media, parent media, state-run media, it's no longer MSM, mainstream media, it's state-run media, SRM.
[00:11:05.424 --> 00:11:05.804]  That's it.
[00:11:06.485 --> 00:11:09.268]  It is state-run media, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:10.325 --> 00:11:20.470]  And everybody's saying that, from Julian Assange, to Greenwald, to Ron Paul, to Rand Paul, to Alex Jones, to Matt Drudge, to anybody that's got a brain.
[00:11:21.571 --> 00:11:22.711]  But it's not just state-run.
[00:11:22.931 --> 00:11:24.372]  Who's captured our government?
[00:11:24.872 --> 00:11:27.794]  Who has seized control of our government?
[00:11:28.854 --> 00:11:34.557]  Foreign corporate anti-free market interest, who do not want us to be able to be individuals.
[00:11:34.617 --> 00:11:37.799]  They want control over us on record.
[00:11:38.795 --> 00:11:44.897]  Now Greenwald's partner has been detained yesterday at Heathrow Airport for nine hours.
[00:11:45.418 --> 00:11:55.982]  Everything he had basically downloaded and stolen all because he works with the reporter Greenwald trying to see what WikiLeaks info or Snowden info he had harassing him.
[00:11:56.302 --> 00:11:58.623]  Held under UK terrorism law.
[00:11:59.443 --> 00:12:13.677]  It's like the UK declared all Icelanders terrorists because, two years ago, because they wouldn't pay the four plus billion dollars of money that wasn't their debt to the private British Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan banks.
[00:12:14.017 --> 00:12:14.458]  By the way,
[00:12:16.224 --> 00:12:19.165]  Chris Jordan came in today and said this was hanging up in his apartment complex.
[00:12:19.566 --> 00:12:23.247]  And he sees Infowars.com stickers everywhere here in Austin in his complex.
[00:12:23.547 --> 00:12:25.808]  And what does it say if you're not a TV viewer?
[00:12:26.228 --> 00:12:29.390]  Iceland's president kicks out FBI agents investigating WikiLeaks.
[00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:32.831]  We arrest banksters, not activists.
[00:12:32.991 --> 00:12:34.632]  The opposite of what America does.
[00:12:34.672 --> 00:12:36.753]  Yeah, that was their president's quote.
[00:12:37.898 --> 00:12:39.999]  And they arrested the finance minister last year.
[00:12:40.459 --> 00:12:54.145]  My point is, is that we are not the terrorists for pointing out how we have been completely and absolutely overrun on every single level of society by these gangsters.
[00:12:56.426 --> 00:12:59.587]  We've got more Fukushima news on the ongoing meltdowns there.
[00:12:59.687 --> 00:13:00.948]  That's getting really big.
[00:13:04.616 --> 00:13:14.322]  We've got reports up on InfoWars.com where Glenn Danzig condemns Obama's drone policies, says the Democrats are really fascists posing as liberals.
[00:13:14.703 --> 00:13:16.163]  Gee, I wonder who he listens to.
[00:13:16.183 --> 00:13:20.366]  He might not even listen to the show, but you can tell he's figured out what's going on.
[00:13:20.386 --> 00:13:24.629]  I mean, boy, I tell you, they're in trouble when Danzig says they're bad.
[00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:30.513]  Continuing with the news here,
[00:13:33.171 --> 00:13:38.696]  Those that are not preparing for the economic depression are going to bitterly regret it.
[00:13:39.736 --> 00:13:42.979]  Supporting whistleblowers, now terrorist activity.
[00:13:43.019 --> 00:13:44.721]  Another article on that.
[00:13:46.042 --> 00:13:50.405]  Leslie Gelb on Egypt, hold your nose and back the junta.
[00:13:53.328 --> 00:13:54.128]  Isn't that interesting?
[00:13:54.649 --> 00:13:59.393]  We saw Paul Krugman of the New York Times come out and admit that Keynesian economics yesterday
[00:14:00.845 --> 00:14:05.066]  is really about centralizing power with the state, but says that's a good thing.
[00:14:06.627 --> 00:14:12.488]  Yeah, but with the select corporate interests that are in control of the state.
[00:14:12.548 --> 00:14:13.829]  In fact, here's the article.
[00:14:13.889 --> 00:14:17.230]  Krugman admits Keynesian economics is about empowering the state.
[00:14:18.055 --> 00:14:24.239]  In a recent screed posted on the blog, Paul Krugman let the cat out of the bag.
[00:14:48.135 --> 00:14:51.376]  Notice he spins that like they're trying to give the power to the people.
[00:14:51.416 --> 00:15:05.801]  The truth is they're trying to give the power to the economic businessman through the government, but not the average businessman or woman who's actually out there hiring people, but select inside cronies.
[00:15:06.502 --> 00:15:13.084]  So they'll tell the truth with one hand out of one side of their mouth, but then lie with the other side of their mouth.
[00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:22.839]  So that is just some of what we're going to be breaking down today, but I really want to shake the broadcast up, and I've been getting closer to doing that in the last few weeks.
[00:15:22.919 --> 00:15:26.502]  Yesterday I took 12 calls on the Sunday show.
[00:15:26.522 --> 00:15:27.483]  Usually I take about six.
[00:15:28.144 --> 00:15:28.985]  So today...
[00:15:30.086 --> 00:15:36.792]  I want to take 12 calls before this hour ends on any subject you want to call in about.
[00:15:37.112 --> 00:15:40.234]  But if it's a diatribe, you want to make a point, make it in about a minute.
[00:15:40.855 --> 00:15:41.155]  Okay?
[00:15:41.816 --> 00:15:45.158]  Or if you have a question for me, I'll try to answer it in a minute so we can get to the next person.
[00:15:45.599 --> 00:15:47.120]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:47.180]  800-259-9231.
[00:15:55.322 --> 00:16:00.407]  And I love all the great ideas callers call in with, but about a third of the callers were telling me what I needed to do.
[00:16:00.507 --> 00:16:07.113]  I should have a national music festival, or I should have a national film festival, or I should do a show about this or that.
[00:16:07.733 --> 00:16:12.598]  And a lot of the ideas you send to us about guests end up being on the show, so email that to Show Tips.
[00:16:13.378 --> 00:16:19.464]  And you're welcome to call in and say who you want to be on the show, but at a certain point, folks, I'm maxed out.
[00:16:20.465 --> 00:16:21.105]  I was up here
[00:16:22.452 --> 00:16:23.653]  At 9 o'clock last night.
[00:16:24.314 --> 00:16:25.695]  And I'm not complaining about that.
[00:16:26.435 --> 00:16:28.777]  It's just I'm up here 7 days a week now.
[00:16:30.158 --> 00:16:30.518]  Okay?
[00:16:31.239 --> 00:16:33.400]  And I'm trying to be a better manager.
[00:16:34.101 --> 00:16:35.402]  I'm trying to get things organized.
[00:16:35.442 --> 00:16:37.123]  I'm trying to redesign and upgrade the sites.
[00:16:37.423 --> 00:16:40.226]  I'm trying to get the new studios and equipment and satellite uplinks done.
[00:16:40.506 --> 00:16:44.849]  I'm trying to get the sales in line to make the money to be able to get the word out.
[00:16:44.889 --> 00:16:46.110]  That's our main mission.
[00:16:47.371 --> 00:16:49.693]  And so I'm doing the best I can here.
[00:16:49.753 --> 00:16:50.353]  Understand that.
[00:16:52.171 --> 00:16:59.934]  I will say on air, my pet peeve, like an ice pick being jabbed in my head, is for people to call up and say, will you please do this or will you please do that.
[00:17:00.815 --> 00:17:18.623]  I try to have other people on air that are launching new media operations or that are out there doing national campaigns to have people go out and protest on the overpasses and call for Obama's impeachment over his attack on the Second Amendment, his funding of Al Qaeda, his funding of the Muslim Brotherhood, his shutting down of the power plants.
[00:17:19.503 --> 00:17:20.904]  Listen, we're all in this together.
[00:17:21.184 --> 00:17:33.650]  I think the message I'm trying to get across to all of you out there, and to my crew and everybody else, is that this is not a spectator sport being free.
[00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:37.732]  I need all of you to get really aggressive in the fight for liberty.
[00:17:39.119 --> 00:17:51.208]  I need all of you to decide to go out and go speak at your city council and then videotape it and put it on YouTube on whatever subject, whether it's water fluoridation or police state behavior, open borders, whatever the case is.
[00:17:51.589 --> 00:17:53.710]  I need you to go do an AXS TV show.
[00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:55.832]  I need you to go do a local radio show.
[00:17:56.172 --> 00:18:03.256]  I need you to call the talk radio every day, other people's shows, and plug this show if you think we're the most hardcore out there.
[00:18:03.556 --> 00:18:09.019]  I need you to subscribe to InfoWars Magazine and give it to friends and family or give gift subscriptions to wake people up.
[00:18:09.319 --> 00:18:15.283]  I need you to buy the films like American Drug War 2 to expose the drug war as a police state vehicle.
[00:18:15.623 --> 00:18:22.167]  I need you to get the film about the CIA and the brainwashing in America that
[00:18:23.392 --> 00:18:28.114]  I am distributing that is so well done and so important that I'm also in state of mind.
[00:18:28.554 --> 00:18:35.376]  I need you to tell people about the free podcast and the free video streams at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:18:35.756 --> 00:18:40.277]  I need you to take action but also realize it isn't work.
[00:18:40.998 --> 00:18:43.198]  It is the animating contest of liberty.
[00:18:44.979 --> 00:18:49.560]  I need you to go into your church and demand the preacher stop being a government minion.
[00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:51.941]  I heard a local talk show this morning
[00:18:53.366 --> 00:18:54.667]  That has some good hosts on it.
[00:18:55.927 --> 00:18:58.208]  Mark Caesar and Sergeant Sam on it.
[00:18:58.228 --> 00:19:00.950]  And there's the other talk show host who kind of plays the part of the liberal on the show.
[00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:04.631]  And they were saying, you know, we should allow churches to be politically involved.
[00:19:05.171 --> 00:19:06.192]  That's the First Amendment.
[00:19:07.052 --> 00:19:09.533]  And the other host was saying, the other two, no it's not.
[00:19:09.613 --> 00:19:10.134]  I called in.
[00:19:11.482 --> 00:19:13.163]  And the host just said, that's just not true.
[00:19:13.183 --> 00:19:14.605]  I said the First Amendment on there.
[00:19:14.645 --> 00:19:19.809]  I said, Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[00:19:20.669 --> 00:19:25.974]  And then when I was gone, the guy that plays the part of the liberal, I think, I don't think he really is a liberal as they call them.
[00:19:26.114 --> 00:19:27.195]  Really, it's authoritarianism.
[00:19:27.955 --> 00:19:30.938]  He says, well, Alex is just wrong.
[00:19:31.178 --> 00:19:32.259]  That isn't true what he said.
[00:19:33.194 --> 00:19:34.315]  All it was, quote, the First Amendment.
[00:19:34.635 --> 00:19:38.817]  Because we've been living under the government running churches for 60 years in this country.
[00:19:39.057 --> 00:19:41.419]  People just accept now that it's the custom, it's okay.
[00:19:41.759 --> 00:19:49.944]  And they were bringing it up because there's a movement with churches nationwide that was small just a few years ago and is now more than 20,000, to be political.
[00:19:51.325 --> 00:19:53.967]  And I'm going to talk about that and then go to your phone calls when we come back.
[00:19:54.027 --> 00:20:01.272]  But that's another example of the churches are just defying the criminal collection agency of the Federal Reserve, the IRS.
[00:20:01.793 --> 00:20:02.894]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:20:02.974 --> 00:20:07.297]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:20:07.477 --> 00:20:13.101]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:20:13.201 --> 00:20:16.464]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:20:16.764 --> 00:20:19.305]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:19.425 --> 00:20:24.246]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[00:20:24.386 --> 00:20:25.126]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:26.626 --> 00:20:28.647]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:20:28.707 --> 00:20:34.928]  You are the target of those who assemble the liberties of free men.
[00:20:35.228 --> 00:20:36.688]  The enemy may have changed.
[00:20:36.968 --> 00:20:38.048]  A cold war.
[00:20:38.249 --> 00:20:40.169]  But the threat to our freedom is not.
[00:20:40.749 --> 00:20:44.492]  Atlas Survival Shelters are light years beyond those of the past.
[00:20:44.812 --> 00:20:46.513]  The fallout shelter is the best defense.
[00:20:46.973 --> 00:20:48.674]  Large, comfortable, secure.
[00:20:48.694 --> 00:20:50.776]  The strongest shelters money can buy.
[00:20:50.956 --> 00:20:56.559]  It's time you see them at iwantthatbunker.com or call 1-855-4BUCKERS.
[00:20:56.839 --> 00:20:58.280]  Atlas Survival Shelters.
[00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:00.522]  Better prepared than scared.
[00:21:01.576 --> 00:21:03.658]  It's hurricane and wildfire season again.
[00:21:03.678 --> 00:21:11.286]  Why do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year, betting their lives that the disaster won't get them?
[00:21:11.707 --> 00:21:16.352]  Hundreds of you helped eFoodsDirect ship 50,000 donated meals to the Oklahoma victims.
[00:21:16.632 --> 00:21:18.534]  The problem is we can't help everybody.
[00:21:19.275 --> 00:21:24.916]  If there's one of us who can, will take care of ourselves, we can all pitch in to take care of those who really can't.
[00:21:25.216 --> 00:21:33.018]  The new Just-In-Case Pack from eFoodsDirect is the big brother to the 7-Day Emergency Pack designed for Oklahoma disaster donations.
[00:21:33.418 --> 00:21:39.740]  It contains a 2-month supply for 1 person, or a 1-month supply for 2 adults, or a 2-week supply for a family of 4.
[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:40.800]  The $320 price is $50 less than retail.
[00:21:44.361 --> 00:21:45.422]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com slash alex.
[00:21:45.442 --> 00:21:47.183]  Order two or more, get 10% off, free shipping applies.
[00:21:47.203 --> 00:21:50.204]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com slash alex.
[00:22:00.802 --> 00:22:04.347]  Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins.
[00:22:04.687 --> 00:22:05.408]  That bears repeating.
[00:22:05.708 --> 00:22:09.233]  Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins.
[00:22:09.593 --> 00:22:13.858]  And Pro-EM1 Daily Probiotic Cleanse is the key to digestive health.

[00:22:29.211 --> 00:22:29.952]  Supports weight loss.
[00:22:30.232 --> 00:22:31.733]  Improves absorption of food nutrients.
[00:22:32.033 --> 00:22:33.434]  Aids in controlling yeast infections.
[00:22:33.694 --> 00:22:34.934]  Is never freeze-dried.
[00:22:35.255 --> 00:22:39.137]  And uses three groups of live, viable, beneficial microbes to cleanse and remove toxins.

[00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:05.294]  There are those curious about bitcoins and those using and making money with bitcoins.
[00:23:05.754 --> 00:23:06.935]  What are bitcoins?
[00:23:07.395 --> 00:23:13.480]  A bitcoin is the first decentralized currency that can be easily transferred from person to person over the internet.
[00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:15.321]  No bank needed.
[00:23:15.701 --> 00:23:21.005]  This means lower fees and accounts can never be frozen, limited or closed.
[00:23:21.386 --> 00:23:23.167]  You are in control of your money.
[00:23:23.647 --> 00:23:24.427]  And the best part?

[00:23:57.908 --> 00:23:59.430]  We mine your business.
[00:24:20.796 --> 00:24:31.360]  Yeah, I've got several articles here in my stack that I'm going to get to later in the next hour after Dr. Blaylock leaves us.
[00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:38.062]  Where, oh my goodness, there's a nationwide movement of now 20,000 churches.
[00:24:38.102 --> 00:24:40.723]  It was like 8,000 last time I checked a few months ago.
[00:24:41.823 --> 00:24:47.745]  And I remember that movement starting on the GCN radio network about
[00:24:49.393 --> 00:24:51.015]  I don't know, more than a decade ago.
[00:24:51.215 --> 00:24:52.476]  Some of the preachers here on air.
[00:24:52.496 --> 00:24:53.598]  I'm not bragging about our network.
[00:24:54.178 --> 00:25:02.989]  I remember, though, different pastors that we had on as guests, different pastors that have radio shows, Pastor Greg Dixon and others in the Indianapolis Baptist Temple.
[00:25:03.329 --> 00:25:04.771]  I guess that was about 12 years ago.
[00:25:06.344 --> 00:25:13.450]  calling for this nationwide movement, but just the last few years it's really picked up steam to go, you know, churches are under the First Amendment.
[00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:19.776]  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[00:25:20.396 --> 00:25:24.100]  Churches are outside the jurisdiction of the federal government and state government.
[00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:28.884]  Separation of church and state means you can't have a state-run religion.
[00:25:29.524 --> 00:25:33.608]  Can't be Baptist, can't be Catholic, can't be Zola Lester, can't be Muslim.
[00:25:34.502 --> 00:25:43.328]  Can't be Islamic law, can't be whatever sect of Christian law you want to make it.
[00:25:44.929 --> 00:25:46.831]  That's what separation of church and state means.
[00:25:47.091 --> 00:25:52.415]  But since the 50s phasing into the 60s, they slowly had the denominations sit there.
[00:25:53.573 --> 00:25:58.939]  And tell their sub-churches you are not allowed now to endorse a candidate.
[00:25:58.959 --> 00:26:01.462]  You're not allowed to have a candidate come and speak at the church.
[00:26:01.843 --> 00:26:09.512]  Then, I've had friends that go to major Baptist churches in Austin and Catholic churches, because I've showed the letters on air, where they say you're not allowed.
[00:26:10.919 --> 00:26:17.283]  To even, as a parishioner, as a member, as a member of the flock, to speak about your views on politics.
[00:26:17.863 --> 00:26:19.764]  Don't do it at a church barbecue.
[00:26:20.065 --> 00:26:21.686]  Don't do it at a church volleyball game.
[00:26:21.966 --> 00:26:23.387]  Don't do it at a church retreat.
[00:26:23.707 --> 00:26:24.807]  You keep that to yourself.
[00:26:25.148 --> 00:26:26.488]  What authoritarianism!
[00:26:26.989 --> 00:26:38.035]  And finally, we had a wake-up call a few months ago, when the audio tapes got released, and we played them here, of the IRS telling pro-life groups, you're not allowed to pray,
[00:26:39.062 --> 00:26:43.045]  And you're not allowed, if you're tax-exempt, to go out and protest for babies.
[00:26:45.167 --> 00:26:46.988]  And then telling them, tell us what you pray.
[00:26:47.308 --> 00:26:51.011]  And churches have audits where they're told, show us your prayers.
[00:26:51.371 --> 00:26:53.473]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's the Soviet Union.
[00:26:53.933 --> 00:26:55.094]  That's Nazi Germany.
[00:26:55.274 --> 00:26:56.595]  The Soviet Union had churches.
[00:26:56.995 --> 00:26:58.216]  Nazi Germany had churches.
[00:26:58.556 --> 00:26:59.817]  Maoist China had churches.
[00:27:00.258 --> 00:27:01.439]  China today has churches.
[00:27:01.759 --> 00:27:05.362]  But you better toe the Communist Party line.
[00:27:05.722 --> 00:27:06.983]  And that's what we've got here.
[00:27:08.206 --> 00:27:20.517]  And I hear two talk show hosts this morning, that's why I've gone off on this jag, before I go to your calls and all the news, explaining, hey, it's the First Amendment, and the other one going, no it isn't, it's fascism to have churches involved in religion.
[00:27:21.357 --> 00:27:22.958]  And really believing that.
[00:27:23.698 --> 00:27:26.959]  You know the story of Patrick Henry, the give me liberty or give me death?
[00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:29.361]  Guys, will you pull this because I forget the preacher's name.
[00:27:29.801 --> 00:27:36.424]  There was a preacher a week before who was beaten to death by British soldiers with a horse whip.
[00:27:36.884 --> 00:27:41.666]  He was beaten to death by a horse whip.
[00:27:43.507 --> 00:27:44.507]  Beaten, and that's hard to do.
[00:27:44.667 --> 00:27:48.389]  Beaten to death over an hour with a horse whip until he went into shock and bled to death.
[00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:54.792]  Because he would not preach the official pro-government issued sermon.
[00:27:56.476 --> 00:27:59.323]  And so they came and watched the sermon, they took him out and they beat him to death.
[00:28:00.094 --> 00:28:06.057]  And then Patrick Henry came out and said, they're already killing us, they're already attacking us, the war has already begun.
[00:28:06.077 --> 00:28:07.658]  I don't know what course you're going to take.
[00:28:07.698 --> 00:28:11.720]  If you want to crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you, may your chains set lightly upon you.
[00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:13.321]  Forget that you are our brethren.
[00:28:13.661 --> 00:28:19.584]  But as for me, I want to know the whole truth, nothing but the truth, and make preparation for it.
[00:28:19.864 --> 00:28:22.085]  And as for me, give me liberty or give me death.
[00:28:23.226 --> 00:28:25.527]  There are a lot of things that the war started over in 1775.
[00:28:27.645 --> 00:28:29.768]  And officially 1776, July 4th.
[00:28:31.431 --> 00:28:39.322]  Taxes, regulations, people being pressed to serve as slaves, white slaves on ships, under the press gangs, the naval ships.
[00:28:40.498 --> 00:28:41.838]  They came for the firearms.
[00:28:41.878 --> 00:28:45.440]  That was when it finally was the spark and the shot heard around the world.
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:51.041]  But what really got everybody in gear was the preachers being told what to do and to have state-run religion.
[00:28:51.481 --> 00:28:58.904]  And that's why it didn't matter whether it was a Catholic colony or a Protestant colony, a Quaker colony, a Puritan colony.
[00:28:59.844 --> 00:29:01.225]  It didn't matter what it was.
[00:29:01.545 --> 00:29:06.408]  They all got together and they said, it's time to get the guns and it's time for a war.
[00:29:06.728 --> 00:29:07.689]  You want a war?
[00:29:07.989 --> 00:29:08.809]  You got one.
[00:29:09.009 --> 00:29:12.291]  You're not coming in to our churches and telling us what to do.
[00:29:13.052 --> 00:29:14.713]  They were called the Black Brigades.
[00:29:16.004 --> 00:29:22.909]  The black regiments, because back then all the preachers, not just the Catholics, wore black with a white thing around their neck.
[00:29:22.949 --> 00:29:23.710]  That was the uniform.
[00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:30.134]  And they said, we are not going to be the slaves of King George III, no king but King Jesus.
[00:29:30.574 --> 00:29:35.718]  And America came together and kicked an empire that was undefeated out of this country.
[00:29:35.778 --> 00:29:38.120]  An empire a few years later that beat Napoleon Bonaparte.
[00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:41.402]  We kicked their butt right back to England.
[00:29:41.442 --> 00:29:42.183]  You understand that?
[00:29:43.902 --> 00:29:44.603]  You understand that?
[00:29:45.344 --> 00:29:48.508]  And the British over there finally got their government back as well.
[00:29:49.109 --> 00:29:49.549]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.031 --> 00:29:51.932]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.433 --> 00:29:54.015]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.956 --> 00:29:57.639]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.058 --> 00:30:10.380]  Dozens of diseases ranging from the common cold and flu to MRSA and pneumonia are all caused by infectious pathogens.
[00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:14.621]  Fortunately, a simple, safe and effective alternative exists.
[00:30:15.061 --> 00:30:28.605]  Supernatural Silver is a new and vastly improved type of silver solution that is safe and extremely effective against 143 types of bacteria, both forms of viruses, mold and yeast, and a limited number of parasites.
[00:30:29.165 --> 00:30:31.146]  It can even purify water!
[00:30:31.646 --> 00:30:36.328]  Supernatural Silver comes in both liquid and gel for internal or external use.
[00:30:36.768 --> 00:30:48.213]  With over 180 scientific studies by independent universities, hospitals, research institutions and nursing homes, Supernatural Silver is a powerful weapon in the fight against disease.

[00:31:02.503 --> 00:31:06.126]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us?
[00:31:06.366 --> 00:31:11.651]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[00:31:11.891 --> 00:31:19.438]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[00:31:19.618 --> 00:31:28.726]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[00:31:28.926 --> 00:31:35.934]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[00:31:36.074 --> 00:31:38.957]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[00:31:38.977 --> 00:31:45.905]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse but demand a war.
[00:31:46.465 --> 00:31:47.386]  Oh, there's another one!
[00:31:47.426 --> 00:31:48.467]  Another plane just hit!
[00:32:02.262 --> 00:32:03.902]  Introducing Pro-1.
[00:32:04.163 --> 00:32:07.683]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[00:32:07.803 --> 00:32:12.205]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[00:32:12.345 --> 00:32:18.346]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:32:18.466 --> 00:32:29.229]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.
[00:32:29.449 --> 00:32:35.755]  It is the only one that does it, and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[00:32:35.955 --> 00:32:50.668]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands,
[00:32:53.233 --> 00:32:58.564]  Get your Pro-Pure with the new Pro-1 filters today at Infowarsstore.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:33:19.662 --> 00:33:25.785]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:33:26.165 --> 00:33:27.706]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:35.349 --> 00:33:38.150]  Alright, I'm going to go to your phone calls here momentarily.
[00:33:40.211 --> 00:33:46.114]  And then we have a host of other news we have not gotten to yet.
[00:33:49.773 --> 00:33:54.077]  We have Congressman Eleanor Holmes Norton voicemail saying, where's my bribe?
[00:33:55.037 --> 00:34:02.023]  We have the new Common Core Obama math standard, 3 times 4 equals 11, not 12.
[00:34:02.984 --> 00:34:06.407]  This is the purposeful destruction of the human mind, on record.
[00:34:06.427 --> 00:34:09.029]  I mean, I've had the former head of policy, Department of Education on about that.
[00:34:10.595 --> 00:34:16.917]  We're going to continue getting into the latest NS Shane is and as I said Max Keiser is coming up along with Dr. Russell Blaylock.
[00:34:17.397 --> 00:34:22.839]  We have something really special that we're offering today and it will undoubtedly probably sell out today or tomorrow.
[00:34:23.539 --> 00:34:34.023]  Weldon had the idea a year ago when we started InfoWars magazine, which most issues of have sold out in the past, to hold back 100 copies of each magazine.
[00:34:35.222 --> 00:34:37.469]  And now we've had our 12th issue come out.
[00:34:38.371 --> 00:34:42.022]  And so it is the first 12 issues and I signed the first one.
[00:34:43.168 --> 00:34:48.791]  For $79.95, and the small profit we make out of this helps fund the operation.
[00:34:48.891 --> 00:34:51.872]  Obviously, shopping with the good guys, so we thank all of you out there.
[00:34:51.912 --> 00:34:57.695]  But we have 100 of these, and we've gotten rid of the signed stuff the last year or so.
[00:34:58.015 --> 00:35:03.758]  We're gonna bring it all back this month for a limited time, obviously, to put more fuel in the tank in the InfoWar.
[00:35:04.579 --> 00:35:11.622]  But InfoWarStore.com, the first 12 issues, 100 are available, period.
[00:35:12.123 --> 00:35:12.723]  And then that's it.
[00:35:14.097 --> 00:35:22.061]  Also, if you go to infowarstore.com, we have the powerful brown seaweed from the Southern Hemisphere, so it's not all polluted like in our Northern Hemisphere.
[00:35:22.461 --> 00:35:27.303]  Amazing detoxer, so good for the thyroid, and that's all on record in major studies.
[00:35:27.844 --> 00:35:30.765]  That's Modiphylon, discounted at infowarstore.com.
[00:35:31.105 --> 00:35:37.868]  You can get ProPure water filtration systems with 10% off with promo code WATER if you're not filtering your water.
[00:35:38.509 --> 00:35:42.751]  That's the number one basic thing you can do, and this is the best stainless steel gravity system out there.
[00:35:43.271 --> 00:35:46.856]  And it has the lowest price, then you add 10% off, you cannot beat this.
[00:35:46.916 --> 00:35:55.347]  Look at the side-by-side comparisons of ProPure systems and the ProOne filters that cut out the fluoride, everything, in side-by-side comparisons to the leading competitors.
[00:35:55.728 --> 00:35:57.450]  Hands down, annihilates them all.
[00:35:58.424 --> 00:35:59.204]  That's why we carry it.
[00:35:59.384 --> 00:36:03.046]  Infowarsstore.com or Infowarshop.com will take you there.
[00:36:03.066 --> 00:36:07.448]  And again, we couldn't do any of this without all of you out there.
[00:36:07.468 --> 00:36:10.690]  It cuts out the glyphosates as well that most filters don't.
[00:36:10.730 --> 00:36:13.651]  That's the roundup that's in almost all of the water tables.
[00:36:14.032 --> 00:36:18.694]  Guys, type in a headline, 97% of water table has glyphosate in it.
[00:36:18.714 --> 00:36:19.794]  I want people to see that headline.
[00:36:19.814 --> 00:36:21.695]  I think it was Washington Post last year.
[00:36:22.055 --> 00:36:22.936]  The point is, is that
[00:36:23.456 --> 00:36:25.537]  It doesn't matter if it's rainwater collection.
[00:36:25.597 --> 00:36:34.140]  It doesn't matter if some of it's on your roof from birds or whatever running in, or if it's in the well water or the tap water.
[00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:37.001]  You've got to filter your water, so it's a win-win-win.
[00:36:37.241 --> 00:36:44.163]  Get a high-quality water filter system that's portable and that does over 10,000 gallons per filter system and support the transmission.
[00:36:44.923 --> 00:36:49.665]  The Pro1 systems with the ProPureInfo or store.com or call toll-free today.
[00:36:51.405 --> 00:36:51.845]  888-253-3139.
[00:36:51.865 --> 00:36:55.486]  888-253-3139.
[00:36:55.506 --> 00:37:03.588]  And you can also write to us at PO Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760.
[00:37:04.669 --> 00:37:10.150]  Okay, without further ado, I'm going to suspend news and news analysis, and I got a lot I'm going to get to.
[00:37:10.530 --> 00:37:12.591]  For now, let's go to your phone calls.
[00:37:13.491 --> 00:37:16.252]  As promised, let's talk to Nate in Florida.
[00:37:16.512 --> 00:37:17.612]  You're on the air worldwide.
[00:37:18.891 --> 00:37:20.613]  Hey Alex, thank you for taking my call.
[00:37:21.233 --> 00:37:22.354]  I love your operation.
[00:37:23.015 --> 00:37:32.143]  Big shout out to your wonderful crew and all the InfoWarriors out there on Prison Planet, not Prison Planet, planetinfowars.com.
[00:37:32.784 --> 00:37:35.246]  I love all of you brothers and sisters in the InfoWar.
[00:37:37.273 --> 00:37:41.054]  I wanted to just bring forth an idea that I had.
[00:37:41.094 --> 00:37:48.436]  It's a simple idea, and I wanted to bounce it off of you and see if it's maybe something that you would consider beneficial.
[00:37:49.436 --> 00:37:52.457]  It's based on the Google Bomb technology.
[00:37:52.477 --> 00:37:55.098]  A couple years ago, you had a great caller.
[00:37:55.718 --> 00:38:23.331]  Who had a Google bomb idea where you would mention search terms on your show every day and we'd Google and create a trend and and really Made an impact on on the web and then Google started censoring Infowars.com and it kind of lost its effect, but this idea is kind of based on that technology Basically what it is is just a
[00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:45.386]  It's just a link that we can all focus on every day, so Planet Info Wars, we'll click on this link or links that you deem important, beneficial, so we can go and leave comments and really create like a social media phenomenon.
[00:38:45.406 --> 00:38:49.708]  No, no, sir, that's absolute genius and we should have a time of day
[00:38:51.115 --> 00:38:58.142]  Where we do it and we focus on Twitter, Facebook, and other systems with a story from Infowars.com.
[00:38:58.642 --> 00:39:00.964]  Now let me explain what happened with the Google bombs.
[00:39:01.545 --> 00:39:09.432]  We probably did a hundred of those or so in a two year period and we could do it every, I should have done it more often, but I didn't want to burn the audience out.
[00:39:11.574 --> 00:39:22.057]  We would put out a term that was connected to some news story we'd put out that was really important and we could get the number one search term almost every time and then get hundreds of news articles out of it.
[00:39:22.578 --> 00:39:29.140]  And so it was artificially doing what only DrudgeReport.com is still able to do just because of the...
[00:39:30.131 --> 00:39:32.352]  I don't know, what is it, 40, 50 million a day or something that visited?
[00:39:32.632 --> 00:39:34.533]  Just some off-the-chart ridiculous number.
[00:39:34.873 --> 00:39:36.014]  Visit DrudgeReport.com.
[00:39:37.235 --> 00:39:46.939]  We were able to do that, but they went and changed the algorithm and announced they changed the algorithm on a bunch of different topics, and suddenly we couldn't do it anymore.
[00:39:50.121 --> 00:39:51.301]  And now they're gaming that.
[00:39:51.462 --> 00:39:52.402]  But here's an example.
[00:39:52.642 --> 00:39:53.803]  It's not doing it today.
[00:39:54.619 --> 00:39:57.464]  But it's been doing it every day the last two months, so it's strange.
[00:39:58.305 --> 00:40:02.271]  I would type in Alex Jones to check what was in Google News every day if you punch up my computer, guys.
[00:40:03.413 --> 00:40:08.261]  And the top link would be the January 9th show that I was on, uh, Piers Morgan.
[00:40:09.761 --> 00:40:17.245]  CNN somehow was gaming it to where they could always on Google News have their old story back up there first.
[00:40:17.626 --> 00:40:19.607]  And I've seen a few times the last two months it wasn't.
[00:40:19.627 --> 00:40:21.648]  Today must be one of those, one of those days.
[00:40:21.708 --> 00:40:23.969]  But we went looked at their code.
[00:40:24.009 --> 00:40:28.892]  They're resubmitting the article every day like it's new.
[00:40:29.532 --> 00:40:32.033]  And I've been told if you do that Google can delist you.
[00:40:32.053 --> 00:40:32.714]  That's fraud.
[00:40:33.621 --> 00:40:36.183]  We don't do that, and we're still delisted from Google News.
[00:40:36.684 --> 00:40:44.870]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com articles cannot show up now on Google News, which is very important.
[00:40:45.391 --> 00:40:49.054]  You know, Google went down for five minutes this weekend, and 40% of web traffic died.
[00:40:49.474 --> 00:40:50.255]  They are the Internet.
[00:40:50.295 --> 00:40:51.256]  They are the NSA.
[00:40:51.616 --> 00:40:52.437]  They're trying to take it over.
[00:40:52.477 --> 00:40:59.285]  So, the good news is people doppelgang our articles to all of their news sites, and so it still gets out on Google News.
[00:41:00.086 --> 00:41:01.187]  So it's a great idea.
[00:41:01.247 --> 00:41:02.008]  We should do it every day.
[00:41:02.048 --> 00:41:04.190]  In fact, let's beta test it.
[00:41:05.952 --> 00:41:09.596]  Let's beta test it right now and go to InfoWars.com.
[00:41:13.257 --> 00:41:16.278]  I got so many computers up in here, I can't even hardly do it on this computer.
[00:41:16.879 --> 00:41:17.759]  And let's pick an article.
[00:41:17.799 --> 00:41:18.319]  Thank you, caller.
[00:41:18.339 --> 00:41:19.200]  I appreciate your call.
[00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:21.000]  Let's go with this.
[00:41:21.941 --> 00:41:23.441]  And I wrote this with Watson this morning.
[00:41:24.342 --> 00:41:26.763]  I called up and left a transcript, and he put it into article form.
[00:41:27.963 --> 00:41:31.325]  And Watson didn't exactly put in there what I wanted in there.
[00:41:31.345 --> 00:41:32.305]  He must have not come across it.
[00:41:32.325 --> 00:41:40.069]  But the point is, they're using troops that are on pharmaceuticals as an excuse to take their rights, and they prime the pump by putting U.S.
[00:41:40.129 --> 00:41:40.669]  military
[00:41:42.319 --> 00:41:48.555]  Ordering them, on record, to take growth hormone, anabolic steroids,
[00:41:50.987 --> 00:42:08.014]  To take basically hillbilly heroin, drugs like Percocet, drugs like Oxycontin before it got taken off the market, so that they then can control them later, and when they get out of the military, we'll put you back on this, even though you're not shot or in pain.
[00:42:08.434 --> 00:42:09.414]  They order them.
[00:42:09.674 --> 00:42:16.617]  And I'd already seen this in the back of the newspaper a few times, and in Pentagon reports, but to have Staff Sergeant Biggs tell us about it really hit home.
[00:42:18.223 --> 00:42:20.123]  And so we have an article dealing with that.
[00:42:20.723 --> 00:42:21.844]  A mass drugging of U.S.
[00:42:21.884 --> 00:42:23.524]  troops, an unreported scandal.
[00:42:24.204 --> 00:42:26.144]  It's the forced mass drugging.
[00:42:26.824 --> 00:42:28.465]  So send me Colin Watson.
[00:42:28.485 --> 00:42:34.546]  Will you run in there and have a Don or somebody or Kurt or Julie or Kit just add the word forced mass drugging?
[00:42:35.286 --> 00:42:35.966]  It's forced.
[00:42:36.926 --> 00:42:38.146]  Because I know how the public works.
[00:42:38.166 --> 00:42:39.987]  They'll think, oh, that's somebody having trouble.
[00:42:40.027 --> 00:42:42.527]  They ordered them on Blue Vox or something.
[00:42:42.567 --> 00:42:43.647]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:42:43.887 --> 00:42:44.127]  Yeah.
[00:42:44.147 --> 00:42:47.128]  20 percent of them are on that, according to the Justice Department's own
[00:42:48.345 --> 00:42:49.686]  That's Pentagon's numbers on that.
[00:42:51.268 --> 00:42:52.910]  And we have those statistics in the article.
[00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:54.331]  The 20% are on psychotropics.
[00:42:54.471 --> 00:42:55.312]  I'm not talking about that.
[00:42:55.732 --> 00:42:57.234]  I mean ordering them on speed.
[00:42:57.955 --> 00:43:00.317]  And I don't mean because they've got to stay up for two days in an emergency.
[00:43:01.118 --> 00:43:01.758]  That's one thing.
[00:43:02.119 --> 00:43:06.783]  If you're pinned down in foxholes for three days and, yeah, you've got speed in your pocket.
[00:43:07.184 --> 00:43:08.045]  There is a time for that.
[00:43:08.385 --> 00:43:12.189]  No, no, this is drugging, ordering them, you will take Percocet.
[00:43:13.889 --> 00:43:15.530]  You will take the speed to come off of it.
[00:43:15.550 --> 00:43:17.931]  You will take Percocet just to get them addicted.
[00:43:18.171 --> 00:43:19.512]  This is a big scandal.
[00:43:21.753 --> 00:43:23.714]  And the officer class is exempt from it.
[00:43:23.754 --> 00:43:29.356]  So let's make that the big number one story of the day.
[00:43:30.377 --> 00:43:34.579]  Let's make that mass drugging of US troops an unreported scandal.
[00:43:35.481 --> 00:43:37.463]  Let's take that and put it out on Twitter.
[00:43:37.863 --> 00:43:39.565]  I'm going to retweet it at RealAlexJones.
[00:43:39.825 --> 00:43:41.146]  Let's put it out on our Facebook.
[00:43:41.607 --> 00:43:43.448]  Let's send it to your email.
[00:43:43.588 --> 00:43:44.209]  I'll send it out.
[00:43:44.549 --> 00:43:49.454]  Everybody signed up for the free newsletter, InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[00:43:49.474 --> 00:43:52.296]  Sign up there, you get the free digital magazine and updates.
[00:43:52.596 --> 00:43:53.557]  Everybody should sign up there.
[00:43:53.577 --> 00:43:59.363]  We'll send that out as the mass email today, this article, and then you send it forward to everybody you know.
[00:43:59.443 --> 00:44:00.684]  Let's do this together.
[00:44:01.977 --> 00:44:03.358]  And let's test the Google algorithm.
[00:44:03.378 --> 00:44:05.879]  I haven't done a Google bomb in about two years since they shut us out.
[00:44:05.919 --> 00:44:11.302]  Let's take that and let's make the Google bomb drugging troops.
[00:44:12.042 --> 00:44:13.743]  Two words, drugging troops.
[00:44:14.083 --> 00:44:19.626]  You go to Google and you put in drugging troops and you enter it over and over and over again.
[00:44:19.666 --> 00:44:24.248]  You re-enter it, put the cursor, make it a new search, enter, enter, enter, enter.
[00:44:24.508 --> 00:44:25.029]  You go up
[00:44:25.629 --> 00:44:26.170]  You type it in.
[00:44:26.190 --> 00:44:26.670]  You hit enter.
[00:44:27.090 --> 00:44:28.372]  Then you put the cursor back in it.
[00:44:28.952 --> 00:44:29.933]  So it's a new search.
[00:44:30.093 --> 00:44:30.614]  Hit it again.
[00:44:30.634 --> 00:44:32.255]  Email it out.
[00:44:32.716 --> 00:44:33.096]  Tweet it.
[00:44:33.236 --> 00:44:33.817]  Let's do it.
[00:44:33.877 --> 00:44:34.638]  Let's do it together.
[00:44:34.838 --> 00:44:36.139]  Let's see what the people can do.
[00:44:36.179 --> 00:44:37.040]  Let's fight back.
[00:44:37.781 --> 00:44:38.442]  Absolutely.
[00:44:38.502 --> 00:44:39.342]  Great job, caller.
[00:44:39.362 --> 00:44:40.664]  See, I said I take 12 calls an hour.
[00:44:40.924 --> 00:44:41.545]  I've taken one.
[00:44:41.565 --> 00:44:42.846]  All right.
[00:44:42.866 --> 00:44:44.127]  Let's go to John in Texas.
[00:44:44.147 --> 00:44:44.808]  You're on the air.
[00:44:44.848 --> 00:44:45.168]  Welcome.
[00:44:45.208 --> 00:44:45.789]  Thanks for holding.
[00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:47.630]  Hi, Alex.
[00:44:48.131 --> 00:44:48.371]  Good.
[00:44:48.431 --> 00:44:49.612]  Good to talk to you.
[00:44:49.632 --> 00:44:49.893]  Go ahead.
[00:44:51.274 --> 00:45:00.038]  Why do you think that our political leadership is ignoring Fukushima, something that could be one of the worst disasters to hit this planet, yet you don't hear nothing about it and they're not warning anybody or anything?
[00:45:02.859 --> 00:45:03.679]  Say that again, sir?
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:15.684]  Why is our political leadership not telling anybody about Fukushima, something that could be one of the worst disasters to hit this planet, yet there's no warnings or nothing about it?
[00:45:16.144 --> 00:45:31.751]  And by the way, it wasn't that you weren't clear, they were popping in my ear, which they're told to do, and so I was missing some of what you said there, because I was noticing that when we put that search in, drugging troops, that it is the top internet YouTube search under that term.
[00:45:32.392 --> 00:45:37.234]  That's what a godsend treasure Infowars.com is, that we're able
[00:45:37.794 --> 00:45:40.798]  To so many cases dominate even the NSA search results.
[00:45:42.279 --> 00:45:49.788]  And I feel like I'm falling down every day, not doing a better job with the incredible platform we've got.
[00:45:49.828 --> 00:45:51.730]  In fact, I'm going to put you on hold and say something right now.
[00:45:52.190 --> 00:45:54.393]  I came in this morning and I begged my crew.
[00:45:55.785 --> 00:45:55.945]  On the
[00:46:16.644 --> 00:46:23.870]  You know, a caller like this calls in, John in Texas, and it hits me like a ton of bricks that I have not articulated properly how big this is.
[00:46:24.310 --> 00:46:31.316]  Because I've psychoanalyzed, historically, comparing them to other elites, other ruling classes, the establishment.
[00:46:33.318 --> 00:46:36.720]  And what he just asked is the big trillion dollar question.
[00:46:38.942 --> 00:46:42.505]  We had corrupt, ruthless, authoritarian elites before 1990.
[00:46:44.585 --> 00:46:45.806]  But they would never let U.S.
[00:46:45.826 --> 00:46:46.947]  military use DU.
[00:46:48.908 --> 00:46:52.311]  Israel had DU and wouldn't use it until recently.
[00:46:52.811 --> 00:46:56.794]  That, by the way, kills their troops long-term, not just who they're shooting.
[00:46:59.536 --> 00:47:02.038]  So it's only Israel, the U.S., and England that are now using it.
[00:47:02.458 --> 00:47:02.979]  That's crazy.
[00:47:04.321 --> 00:47:14.672]  Every time you fire it, it ignites in the barrel and you get a debilitating dose, a soft kill dose, just in what comes out of the front of the barrel and that you breathe.
[00:47:19.713 --> 00:47:29.358]  If you look at things like Fukushima, conservatively, and Dr. Busby's on, nuclear physicist on Friday, conservatively, according to him and others, about a hundred times worse than Chernobyl in 1986.
[00:47:30.338 --> 00:47:37.361]  And you realize that the UN's own numbers say it's killed around a million people in the last few decades since Chernobyl.
[00:47:37.721 --> 00:47:38.642]  I guess 17 years.
[00:47:40.463 --> 00:47:44.445]  When you realize, or how long has it been since 1986?
[00:47:44.505 --> 00:47:45.545]  I can't even do math anymore.
[00:47:46.065 --> 00:47:47.166]  I guess it's 20 something years.
[00:47:48.271 --> 00:47:48.811]  How long is that?
[00:47:49.632 --> 00:47:50.773]  Yeah, 20-something years.
[00:47:50.813 --> 00:47:51.874]  My brain's gone, folks.
[00:47:52.314 --> 00:47:53.035]  I'm doing too much.
[00:47:53.695 --> 00:48:07.585]  And the point is, is that now 91% according to the International Atomic Energy Agency of reactors are leaking, so they had to change the standards last year and say that's okay.
[00:48:08.106 --> 00:48:14.290]  Now they've taken the alarms off the reactors all over North America, Canada, you name it, so that it doesn't scare the public.
[00:48:14.310 --> 00:48:16.392]  When the alarms go off, loudspeakers,
[00:48:17.813 --> 00:48:21.596]  You know, in Southern California last year they kept having alarms.
[00:48:21.896 --> 00:48:23.558]  They said, we're just going to turn the alarms off now.
[00:48:24.699 --> 00:48:26.300]  And the elite live in those areas.
[00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:28.602]  It's like they don't care anymore either.
[00:48:28.962 --> 00:48:35.668]  They put out propaganda and use normal human laziness to kind of politically neutralize the general public.
[00:48:36.169 --> 00:48:37.570]  So we would submit to them.
[00:48:38.210 --> 00:48:41.053]  But there's blowback from their own propaganda.
[00:48:42.136 --> 00:48:45.217]  The mindset, the spirit of the world.
[00:48:45.957 --> 00:48:46.357]  What is that?
[00:48:46.397 --> 00:48:53.260]  That's really kind of the sixth sense broadcast that they've scientifically proven is in all plants and animals, not just humans.
[00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:56.481]  You know, you go into a room, you feel the electric energy.
[00:48:56.501 --> 00:48:57.861]  You go in the room, you feel the depression.
[00:48:58.161 --> 00:48:59.462]  It's like a broadcast.
[00:49:00.042 --> 00:49:01.822]  You can call it spiritual, whatever you want.
[00:49:02.143 --> 00:49:06.404]  It's been over and over again, thousands of times, scientifically quantified.
[00:49:08.214 --> 00:49:11.496]  You walk in a room, you can tell if somebody's not even talking, they're putting off bad vibes.
[00:49:11.796 --> 00:49:15.057]  Or you can tell when somebody's looking at you in a restaurant, you turn around, they're looking at you.
[00:49:16.638 --> 00:49:20.620]  There's a spirit in the elite of not caring and just wanting to die themselves.
[00:49:21.541 --> 00:49:30.485]  And they've kind of passed it on to us, to where Fukushima happens and all this other stuff happens now, and open-air GMO crops, you name it, and they just don't care anymore.
[00:49:32.830 --> 00:49:35.691]  And they think somehow they're going to get around it or get by it, and they're not.
[00:49:36.311 --> 00:49:42.272]  And so you ask why they don't care and why they cover it up, they're not even trying to fix it so it doesn't happen more.
[00:49:44.272 --> 00:49:45.632]  They just don't care anymore.
[00:49:45.672 --> 00:49:48.393]  They're like Nero fiddling while Rome burned.
[00:49:48.873 --> 00:49:53.614]  Finally he was so decadent, he said, I'm so decadent, I'll just commit suicide because I can.
[00:49:53.874 --> 00:49:55.994]  Does that answer your question, John in Texas?
[00:49:57.014 --> 00:50:00.195]  Well, what I think is, you know they got all these underground cities.
[00:50:01.215 --> 00:50:10.399]  I think they figured that while the rest of us are dying from radiation, they can run to their underground cities and basically become the Morlocks that H.G.U.L.s roll about in the future, you know?
[00:50:11.139 --> 00:50:14.460]  And I don't know if that's what the deal is or not, but they've been building these underground cities.
[00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:19.262]  I think they figured they're gonna just run in there and hide while the rest of us die from the radiation poisoning, you know?
[00:50:19.568 --> 00:50:20.248]  Well, that is true.
[00:50:20.288 --> 00:50:23.811]  The United States has spent more than all governments combined on underground bases on record.
[00:50:24.271 --> 00:50:25.632]  The details are classified.
[00:50:26.472 --> 00:50:27.573]  More on COG.
[00:50:28.013 --> 00:50:30.815]  And now Homeland Security is the coming out of COG.
[00:50:31.375 --> 00:50:36.519]  The absorption, like in the movie The Thing, of the old republic.
[00:50:37.379 --> 00:50:38.580]  And it's going to absorb everything.
[00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:40.461]  Nothing's going to be left standing.
[00:50:41.161 --> 00:50:42.302]  It is satanic.
[00:50:42.342 --> 00:50:44.143]  It is a diabolical total takeover plan.
[00:50:44.483 --> 00:50:45.044]  Thank you, John.
[00:50:45.564 --> 00:50:46.305]  Okay, coal.

[00:52:58.449 --> 00:52:59.770]  survivalistcamps.com
[00:53:00.971 --> 00:53:02.591]  Introducing Pro-1.
[00:53:02.872 --> 00:53:06.352]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[00:53:06.492 --> 00:53:10.914]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[00:53:11.034 --> 00:53:17.035]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:53:17.155 --> 00:53:27.918]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.
[00:53:28.138 --> 00:53:34.442]  It is the only one that does it, and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[00:53:34.622 --> 00:53:49.370]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands,
[00:53:49.810 --> 00:53:52.793]  Well, you were sleeping They came and took it all away
[00:54:22.618 --> 00:54:38.326]  You know, I figured out why I get up here and talk a hundred miles an hour.
[00:54:38.707 --> 00:54:40.568]  I don't do that in person.
[00:54:42.228 --> 00:54:48.892]  I just get in this mindset of focusing on what's happening and it hits me how real all this is.
[00:54:50.950 --> 00:54:52.072]  This is not a game.
[00:54:52.412 --> 00:54:55.796]  The things we talk about here, if you're a new listener, are really happening.
[00:54:56.237 --> 00:54:58.440]  Our government really runs Al Qaeda worldwide.
[00:54:58.760 --> 00:55:03.987]  Our government really backs the Muslim Brotherhood to burn up and blow up 60 plus churches in the last week.
[00:55:04.958 --> 00:55:12.604]  Our government really supports every wicked evil thing you can imagine to destabilize the world because they make money off of it coming and going.
[00:55:13.065 --> 00:55:14.526]  Our government is illegitimate.
[00:55:15.026 --> 00:55:22.872]  Our government is a fraud, openly abolishing the Bill of Rights and Constitution and all the protections that go along with it right now.
[00:55:24.854 --> 00:55:29.318]  That's what every analyst across the board points out, is that it's all happening right now.
[00:55:30.066 --> 00:55:30.827]  This is big.
[00:55:31.147 --> 00:55:31.928]  This is real.
[00:55:32.228 --> 00:55:33.149]  This is serious.
[00:55:33.489 --> 00:55:34.370]  This is pertinent.
[00:55:34.670 --> 00:55:35.951]  This is going to affect everyone.
[00:55:36.192 --> 00:55:50.425]  And to all the yuppies and trendies that think it protects them, that they act like they don't care about anything, you are living in the last days of our free republic and the last shadow under the wings of the republic.
[00:55:52.438 --> 00:55:56.742]  But it's now already fading away, and all the prosperity is going out the door with it.
[00:55:57.082 --> 00:56:05.389]  We are becoming, like everybody else, slaves run by the corrupt El Jefes, the corrupt New World Order king rats.
[00:56:06.369 --> 00:56:10.593]  And now is the time to decide what you're going to do about it.
[00:56:12.134 --> 00:56:13.975]  And it doesn't mean you've got to save the world by yourself.
[00:56:14.867 --> 00:56:26.011]  It means you gotta do a little something, say no to things, stand up to being treated like a slave, learn your rights, learn your freedoms, and become aggressive in the prosecution of liberty against tyranny.
[00:56:27.271 --> 00:56:28.752]  A free people will not be slaves.
[00:56:29.012 --> 00:56:31.693]  You have to decide you're free and then act like you're free.
[00:56:32.513 --> 00:56:34.414]  If you act like you're a slave, you'll be a slave.
[00:56:34.474 --> 00:56:35.394]  It's very simple.
[00:56:36.135 --> 00:56:38.835]  Let's go to Cole in Georgia.
[00:56:38.875 --> 00:56:40.296]  You're on the air, sir.
[00:56:40.316 --> 00:56:40.696]  Go ahead.
[00:56:42.137 --> 00:56:42.377]  Alex.
[00:56:42.777 --> 00:56:43.097]  Hey, brother.
[00:56:44.753 --> 00:56:46.254]  It's nice to finally get to talk to you.
[00:56:48.176 --> 00:56:53.259]  I want to know how everything is going on in Egypt now.
[00:56:55.241 --> 00:57:00.004]  About the military giving aid to the people in Egypt.
[00:57:00.845 --> 00:57:03.046]  I'm just kind of curious about what's going on.
[00:57:03.126 --> 00:57:08.971]  Well our military, it's not our military, our captured military has been giving aid to
[00:57:10.418 --> 00:57:26.120]  If you go back three and a half, well really four years ago, Google on record created the Arab Spring, the West ordered the military to run a coup basically against the dictator of Egypt.
[00:57:27.882 --> 00:57:37.971]  Haji Mubarak, to then have the whole fake election and have Google test social networking to put Morrissey in, who's basically an Al-Qaeda type person.
[00:57:38.651 --> 00:57:47.039]  And then they've had just over a year and a half just murdering Christians, crucifying Christians and others in the presidential palace grounds.
[00:57:47.499 --> 00:57:49.100]  I mean, just it's been hell on earth.
[00:57:49.581 --> 00:57:53.985]  Because everywhere the globalists go, they want to kill Christians, just to give you an idea of who they really are.
[00:57:55.166 --> 00:57:56.267]  I don't know.
[00:58:08.601 --> 00:58:09.782]  To those groups.
[00:58:10.182 --> 00:58:17.305]  And now you notice our media for the last couple weeks keeps calling them protesters as they machine gun people, burn people, throw people off roofs.
[00:58:17.565 --> 00:58:19.325]  And the military shoots them to stop them.
[00:58:20.026 --> 00:58:23.707]  And then they're called, oh my gosh, on CNN, the military's killing people.
[00:58:24.027 --> 00:58:25.908]  CNN loved them killing people at Waco.
[00:58:26.548 --> 00:58:28.849]  CNN loves it when the police beat your head in here.
[00:58:29.850 --> 00:58:32.051]  And I'm not saying that the Egyptian military is perfect.
[00:58:32.591 --> 00:58:35.152]  The truth is, they've broken with the globalists.
[00:58:36.172 --> 00:58:37.914]  Because they're trying to bring their country down.
[00:58:38.094 --> 00:58:40.057]  I'm gonna come back to you before we go to Blaylock.
[00:58:44.322 --> 00:58:48.307]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.

[00:59:54.608 --> 00:59:56.532]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:57.013 --> 00:59:59.778]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:06.311 --> 01:00:10.494]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:11.134 --> 01:00:11.935]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.735 --> 01:00:13.636]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:14.276 --> 01:00:17.898]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.459 --> 01:00:22.541]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:27.972 --> 01:00:37.414]  Alright, if you just joined us, we got to Dr. Russell Blaylock coming up on big Obamacare news, big news on Coca-Cola putting out these ads saying aspartame's not bad for you.
[01:00:37.954 --> 01:00:41.354]  That's all coming up, but we're taking calls right now and then more calls later in the hour.
[01:00:42.395 --> 01:00:46.915]  Cole was asking about how is our government funding the Muslim Brotherhood?
[01:00:46.955 --> 01:00:55.097]  Well, on record, they've been backing them with billions of dollars of extra money and saying that if the military government
[01:00:55.814 --> 01:00:57.195]  Because what else is there in the government?
[01:00:57.215 --> 01:01:14.107]  You know, if they kick out the old government and put the Muslim Brotherhood in, and then 30 million people go out and protest, which is, you know, 10 times what the Muslim Brotherhood could put on the streets, they could put a couple, you know, two, three million now, and then basically the secularists, the Christians, the Muslims that aren't extremists,
[01:01:15.010 --> 01:01:18.971]  The Shiite Muslims, others, they go out 30 million, the military didn't have a choice.
[01:01:19.691 --> 01:01:25.792]  So they said, okay, we've got to remove Morrissey, who was engaged in all sorts of war crimes that our media wouldn't cover.
[01:01:27.572 --> 01:01:33.693]  The whole Middle East is being given to radical Muslims right now, from Libya, to Syria, to Iraq, to you name it.
[01:01:35.454 --> 01:01:40.834]  Our government's funding four different Al-Qaeda groups on record to blow stuff up inside Iran.
[01:01:41.475 --> 01:01:43.695]  And Iran is publicly suing the U.S.
[01:01:43.735 --> 01:01:44.015]  about it.
[01:01:44.835 --> 01:01:47.837]  But again, the average American cannot even find Iran on a map, folks.
[01:01:48.538 --> 01:01:51.039]  I mean, they've done national studies where 80-plus percent can't.
[01:01:51.059 --> 01:01:52.901]  I just saw one a few months ago.
[01:01:53.701 --> 01:01:56.903]  You see those things on TV where people don't know even what planet they're on.
[01:01:57.824 --> 01:02:13.415]  And so, it's like, Al-Qaeda is the skeleton key, and radical Wahhabism and radical Islam is a real threat, but the globalists, the big banks, are funding it to take over countries, but then also take over here, building a system up to oppose it.
[01:02:14.372 --> 01:02:19.634]  It's basic funding both sides that the Rothschilds were so good at 200 plus years ago in Europe.
[01:02:20.554 --> 01:02:24.575]  That system the British Empire adopted is the system of the globalists.
[01:02:25.075 --> 01:02:25.996]  They want trouble.
[01:02:26.036 --> 01:02:27.036]  They want crises.
[01:02:27.076 --> 01:02:28.096]  They want monopolies.
[01:02:28.396 --> 01:02:29.337]  They want wars.
[01:02:29.837 --> 01:02:41.560]  They want Al-Qaeda with 10,000 heat-seeking missiles given to them by the Pentagon in Libya so they can shut down all of society in the name of stopping them once they start blowing up aircraft.
[01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:43.181]  And by the way, I've been telling you that for two years.
[01:02:44.468 --> 01:02:45.208]  It was in the news.
[01:02:46.669 --> 01:02:55.955]  Last week we covered it with mainstream media going, Al-Qaeda is predicted to start shooting down European and US and Canadian airliners.
[01:02:55.975 --> 01:03:01.778]  And they admitted in the articles, the BBC also had one, oh yeah, they got them in Libya, the US and NATO let them get them.
[01:03:01.979 --> 01:03:04.160]  They didn't let them give them, they gave them to them.
[01:03:07.312 --> 01:03:10.053]  Because they're going to blow stuff up, and then we're going to lose our rights.
[01:03:10.113 --> 01:03:12.014]  I mean, can you figure that out?
[01:03:12.254 --> 01:03:14.155]  Until we say, no more holding us hostage.
[01:03:14.175 --> 01:03:17.676]  You know, the globalists hold us hostage and go, give up your rights or Al-Qaeda will kill you.
[01:03:17.916 --> 01:03:28.820]  Okay, then let Al-Qaeda blow up airplanes, and we're going to arrest everybody in the Pentagon and the Obama administration who was involved in this, and no amount of pardons are going to protect you.
[01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:34.382]  And that's why we're putting the narrative out now, so when it happens, everybody knows who to blame.
[01:03:34.682 --> 01:03:36.223]  Stop holding us hostage!
[01:03:37.023 --> 01:03:38.364]  I want to live in a free country!
[01:03:40.886 --> 01:03:48.531]  I don't want to sit here and be held hostage by a military-industrial complex that's anti-American and anti-freedom, and it's funded a bunch of jihadis!
[01:03:48.971 --> 01:03:50.132]  Does that answer your question, Cole?
[01:03:50.152 --> 01:03:50.973]  Excuse my ranting.
[01:03:52.254 --> 01:03:52.814]  Uh, no problem.
[01:03:52.854 --> 01:03:53.574]  That's fine.
[01:03:53.594 --> 01:03:55.596]  I'm sorry that I was dirty like I was before.
[01:03:55.616 --> 01:03:56.256]  I was kind of nervous.
[01:03:56.436 --> 01:03:57.337]  Buddy, you're kicking butt.
[01:03:57.377 --> 01:03:58.498]  You brought up a really good question.
[01:03:59.538 --> 01:04:01.560]  Yeah, I was, uh, kind of curious about it, but...
[01:04:02.412 --> 01:04:04.694]  So yeah, I guess that's basically what they're doing.
[01:04:04.714 --> 01:04:06.315]  They're trying to set the New World Order up.
[01:04:06.675 --> 01:04:09.317]  Getting all their, get their own men in and their own players.
[01:04:09.678 --> 01:04:09.958]  You know?
[01:04:11.579 --> 01:04:15.162]  Well, I mean our filthy government that's, it's not our government.
[01:04:15.182 --> 01:04:16.823]  I keep saying we're over in Iraq.
[01:04:16.863 --> 01:04:17.824]  We're over in Afghanistan.
[01:04:18.084 --> 01:04:18.584]  No, we're not.
[01:04:18.885 --> 01:04:22.107]  Our kidnapped men and women are over there being abused.
[01:04:22.147 --> 01:04:28.272]  We have an article up on InfoWars.com with mainstream links and eyewitnesses to the troops, all of them.
[01:04:29.229 --> 01:04:37.492]  The enlisted and non-commissioned officers being ordered to take speed, to take opium drugs, to take all sorts of stuff, to then later compromise them.
[01:04:38.172 --> 01:04:46.095]  Then they come in and drug test them and say, oh, we're going to court-martial you unless you agree that you have post-traumatic stress disorder because you're on these drugs.
[01:04:46.515 --> 01:04:48.596]  And they say, you ordered me to take them.
[01:04:48.896 --> 01:04:53.878]  And they go, you shut your mouth, Staff Sergeant, or I'll have you standing tall before the man.
[01:04:55.458 --> 01:04:59.479]  This is disgusting what we've got going on here, and I've had enough of it.
[01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:04.880]  Protecting your home with a security system is a must.
[01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:11.142]  But when it comes to protecting your family, your home, and belongings, there's no need to sign a long-term contract.
[01:05:11.482 --> 01:05:17.863]  Listen, there is some real scum in the alarm business cashing in by locking you into long, punishing contracts.

[01:06:01.485 --> 01:06:06.068]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[01:06:06.208 --> 01:06:09.170]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[01:06:09.330 --> 01:06:14.554]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[01:06:14.894 --> 01:06:16.555]  It all comes down to one thing.
[01:06:16.835 --> 01:06:18.156]  We are what we eat.
[01:06:18.456 --> 01:06:22.799]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[01:06:23.140 --> 01:06:27.122]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[01:06:27.362 --> 01:06:29.624]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[01:06:29.904 --> 01:06:35.831]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[01:08:12.856 --> 01:08:13.837]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:14.397 --> 01:08:18.040]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:18.581 --> 01:08:22.664]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:39.466 --> 01:08:42.567]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide.
[01:08:42.607 --> 01:08:45.549]  Thank you for joining us here in the second hour.
[01:08:46.369 --> 01:09:00.375]  Coming up over the first 30 minutes of the third hour, Max Keiser is going to be joining us to cover the waterfront of news and really focus in on the creeping up of interest rates worldwide that he predicted, the bond market in trouble that he successfully predicted.
[01:09:01.295 --> 01:09:04.201]  He's going to be joining us for about 30 minutes.
[01:09:04.221 --> 01:09:08.811]  For the next 45 minutes or so, then I'll go back to the callers that are holding on news issues.
[01:09:09.272 --> 01:09:11.216]  We're joined by Dr. Russell Blaylock.
[01:09:12.136 --> 01:09:13.596]  Retired medical doctor.
[01:09:13.616 --> 01:09:17.998]  He is a best-selling author, board-certified neurosurgeon.
[01:09:18.038 --> 01:09:18.818]  That's brain surgeon.
[01:09:19.558 --> 01:09:24.379]  He's a former clinical professor of neurology at the University of Mississippi Medical Center.
[01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:27.580]  And I'm not going to go over his whole bio, but he's extremely famous.
[01:09:28.140 --> 01:09:36.623]  And it came up decades ago with terms like excitotoxins and things like that that are now mainline accepted in the medical literature.
[01:09:38.023 --> 01:09:43.747]  And of course he also developed many of the now most commonly used forms of brain surgery.
[01:09:43.767 --> 01:09:50.973]  I'm not going to get into all that, but he's a brain surgeon's brain surgeon and he's got a bunch of great websites.
[01:09:51.193 --> 01:09:58.638]  We'll give you some of those coming up today so you can visit his sites and learn more about what he's doing.
[01:09:58.718 --> 01:09:59.539]  And the good news is
[01:10:00.239 --> 01:10:04.020]  He travels the world speaking to, in some cases, thousands of physicians.
[01:10:04.580 --> 01:10:12.763]  I know because we went and interviewed him in Las Vegas when he was speaking to, it looked like a thousand top physicians, laying all the info you're about to hear out to them.
[01:10:13.863 --> 01:10:18.644]  So, I'm not sitting here, you know, just blowing smoke at the audience.
[01:10:18.684 --> 01:10:27.967]  I want you to know how effective he's been because we need to understand that we're on the march and this tyranny is on the run.
[01:10:29.247 --> 01:10:42.502]  And that there are a lot of good people, lawyers, doctors, scientists, military men and women, prominent leaders that are telling the truth and that's why we're seeing the alternative media explode while the mainstream media dies, you know?
[01:10:43.615 --> 01:10:55.505]  Four years ago, Dr. Blaylock came on and said this wine flu, H1N1, is a hoax, it's very dangerous, and it's going to increase the instances of the flu.
[01:10:56.025 --> 01:10:57.066]  And he gave a bunch of examples.
[01:10:57.166 --> 01:11:07.955]  A year later, they came out in the official Canadian government journals and admitted it doubled your chances of getting regular flu, gave people Guillain-Barré, epilepsy, everything he said.
[01:11:08.888 --> 01:11:10.609]  Because he, for decades, witnessed it.
[01:11:11.409 --> 01:11:14.131]  But he first got demonized all over the media for it.
[01:11:14.471 --> 01:11:15.131]  But so what?
[01:11:15.231 --> 01:11:16.232]  That's a badge of honor.
[01:11:17.212 --> 01:11:20.454]  He laid out for us four years ago what Obamacare would do.
[01:11:20.914 --> 01:11:21.935]  Now it's being implemented.
[01:11:22.395 --> 01:11:23.635]  You're seeing that all happen.
[01:11:24.616 --> 01:11:30.299]  So, the reason I like to introduce some of our long-term guests who only come on a few times a year like this is to understand
[01:11:31.877 --> 01:11:34.238]  The truth is out there, and the system knows the truth.
[01:11:34.298 --> 01:11:37.700]  This year, they're running ads, school's about to start, that it's the law.
[01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:39.220]  You've got to take vaccines.
[01:11:39.981 --> 01:11:40.841]  There is no law.
[01:11:40.941 --> 01:11:42.021]  You've got to take vaccines.
[01:11:42.502 --> 01:11:44.803]  They also lie in the news and say there's no side effects.
[01:11:45.123 --> 01:11:46.083]  Read the insert, folks.
[01:11:46.123 --> 01:11:46.964]  Go to the CDC.
[01:11:47.344 --> 01:11:51.806]  Read the vaccine you're taking and see the, in some cases, hundreds of pages per shot.
[01:11:52.466 --> 01:11:53.067]  of what they are.
[01:11:53.687 --> 01:12:00.674]  It's a choice of do you listen to people that are truthful and give you sources, or do you listen to liars?
[01:12:01.134 --> 01:12:03.276]  And that's why Dr. Blaylock joins us.
[01:12:03.316 --> 01:12:11.924]  Now I first wanted to get him on last week about Coca-Cola running print ads and internet ads, but also TV ads are coming.
[01:12:12.825 --> 01:12:22.137]  Defending aspartame that Dr. Blaylock has been extremely, extremely prominent in exposing.
[01:12:22.378 --> 01:12:28.986]  They're also saying it doesn't make you gain weight, even though big studies came out in, what was it, Harvard Medical Journal this year.
[01:12:29.867 --> 01:12:47.574]  Saying it's linked to obesity so he's the trailblazer the first really prominent person 20 plus years ago to expose all this so I thought I would just we don't do this with most guests give you all the things they've done I've only told you a fraction of it and we're gonna get to that with him, but I wanted to first
[01:12:48.374 --> 01:12:56.996]  Throw a curveball at him and say, Dr. Blaylock, you laid out as a physician what Obamacare would do by reading it.
[01:12:57.036 --> 01:12:58.857]  Now we're seeing the train wreck.
[01:13:00.057 --> 01:13:02.058]  A, what is Obamacare really designed to do?
[01:13:02.518 --> 01:13:05.579]  B, how do you think its implementation is going?
[01:13:05.879 --> 01:13:07.199]  And what can we do to reverse this?
[01:13:07.219 --> 01:13:07.919]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:09.580]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:13:11.545 --> 01:13:23.247]  Well, the Obamacare thing, when I was interviewed by you, what I told you is that the interesting thing about the bill, all 2,000 pages of it, it's a gigantic blank check.
[01:13:25.048 --> 01:13:35.109]  What it actually says in writing, that you can come back and hold their feet to the fire like you do the Constitution or other laws, there's nothing specific in it.
[01:13:35.169 --> 01:13:38.250]  What it does, it says these decisions will be made later.
[01:13:38.951 --> 01:13:41.313]  By the Secretary of Health and Human Services.
[01:13:42.153 --> 01:13:43.714]  That's all through the document.
[01:13:44.375 --> 01:13:57.664]  Well, who would enact a bill that's a blank check that says all these things, the design, the effects, the punishment, the cost, it's all going to be determined later.
[01:13:57.744 --> 01:14:00.265]  Well, you know, only a fool would do such a thing.
[01:14:00.326 --> 01:14:03.748]  And of course, Congress acts like a gigantic fool.
[01:14:05.417 --> 01:14:12.262]  So, they designed this thing so that you can manipulate it continuously once it's enacted.
[01:14:12.983 --> 01:14:18.307]  Now, you hear a lot, and there's a lot of books published on what Obamacare means, what you need to know.
[01:14:18.967 --> 01:14:22.931]  Most of these things really don't get into the meat of this bill.
[01:14:23.631 --> 01:14:27.935]  This bill is going to change the face of America drastically.
[01:14:29.156 --> 01:14:32.118]  And what I mean by that, and the physicians aren't even aware of this,
[01:14:33.041 --> 01:14:51.034]  In this, if you go by the people who design these things, their ultimate plan is to, number one, make most people to be seen by physicians assistants, nurse practitioners, and not physicians.
[01:14:52.295 --> 01:14:54.757]  They've been wanting to do this for 50 years.
[01:14:56.593 --> 01:15:03.818]  They write about it extensively and their model has been Cuba and other communist countries where this is done extensively.
[01:15:03.878 --> 01:15:08.301]  That is, you're taken care of by someone that's not a trained physician.
[01:15:09.742 --> 01:15:16.946]  Number two is that the physicians themselves are going to be encouraged to become general physicians, not specialists.
[01:15:17.927 --> 01:15:25.292]  What they know is that the cost of specialty care is enormously expensive compared to general care.
[01:15:26.407 --> 01:15:38.174]  Uh, when you look at the analysis of every socialist healthcare system in the world, uh, Britain being a good example, and Canada, uh, what they quickly discovered was two things about specialty care.
[01:15:38.234 --> 01:15:43.357]  Number one is enormous expense, and number two is that they're very independent doctors.
[01:15:43.617 --> 01:15:45.198]  They don't like to be told what to do.
[01:15:46.178 --> 01:15:52.242]  In England, they had to compromise and let the, uh, independent doctors collect private fees.
[01:15:52.882 --> 01:15:54.263]  The only way they could keep them working.
[01:15:55.544 --> 01:16:10.038]  Uh, so they've learned that lesson now, and so what they've done in this bill is designed it so the punishments to the physician, uh, include, uh, imprisonment, loss of license, uh, public vilification.
[01:16:10.058 --> 01:16:13.121]  Uh, there's a number of things that's going to be done.
[01:16:13.622 --> 01:16:15.964]  Uh, for instance, uh, it clearly says that if
[01:16:16.650 --> 01:16:24.914]  You treat a patient in a hospital and that patient goes home and then ends up having to come back to the emergency room within a certain length of time.
[01:16:25.574 --> 01:16:28.575]  The doctor and the hospital are both going to be punished.
[01:16:29.015 --> 01:16:30.136]  Well, let me stop you right there.
[01:16:30.216 --> 01:16:42.821]  My dad, who's very successful as an oral surgeon and dentist in medical management, he has made the decision to phase out in the next year and not do it anymore because they all get called in by the state boards.
[01:16:42.861 --> 01:16:44.902]  He goes down to the Capitol and is even in the meetings.
[01:16:45.302 --> 01:16:50.065]  And the feds are there and say, you work with us, you can make money, do whatever you want.
[01:16:50.446 --> 01:16:52.647]  If not, we're going to set you up and send you to prison.
[01:16:53.148 --> 01:16:56.350]  And if you dot an I wrong, you're going to go to jail.
[01:16:56.710 --> 01:16:58.151]  And my dad's just like, you know what?
[01:16:58.231 --> 01:16:58.892]  I'm out of here.
[01:16:59.152 --> 01:17:01.774]  And he says almost everybody he knows is leaving.
[01:17:02.034 --> 01:17:08.639]  And he knows, Dr. Blaylock, as you said, that the plan is to make everybody quit so they can just fully take it over.
[01:17:09.673 --> 01:17:12.175]  Well, and you see, this is the alternative.
[01:17:12.215 --> 01:17:15.837]  What they want to do is replace American physicians with foreign physicians.
[01:17:17.038 --> 01:17:27.505]  For instance, the Cuban government had offered during Hurricane Katrina and several times to the state of Mississippi to send in Cuban physicians to help treat the poor.
[01:17:27.525 --> 01:17:29.306]  You know, they always have to use the hook.
[01:17:31.068 --> 01:17:34.590]  And the state of Mississippi refused, but they keep trying.
[01:17:34.630 --> 01:17:38.733]  Well, this is part of the plan and the model used by these think tanks.
[01:17:39.524 --> 01:17:44.887]  Uh, is to use foreign, uh, physicians, uh, from Pakistan, for instance.
[01:17:44.987 --> 01:17:46.188]  That's what the VA does!
[01:17:46.628 --> 01:17:56.033]  Right, and so they bring more and more of these people in, so, uh, eventually, the, the Native, uh, American physician is no longer gonna be around.
[01:17:56.874 --> 01:18:02.877]  And, of course, uh, you know, the ones who persist and stay around, they're gonna risk imprisonment, and which has already happened.
[01:18:03.477 --> 01:18:07.860]  You know, most of the public's not aware how many physicians have been railroaded and sent to prison.
[01:18:08.702 --> 01:18:16.064]  Uh, over, uh, uh, eras and trying to interpret this uninterpretable coding nonsense they have to do.
[01:18:16.084 --> 01:18:18.645]  Uh, you know, no one knows the codes.
[01:18:18.685 --> 01:18:22.666]  They even went to the people who designed the codes and said, well, they don't know what it means.
[01:18:23.727 --> 01:18:29.348]  Uh, so, here's a poor physician trying to figure out how to code his patient for medical reimbursement.
[01:18:29.929 --> 01:18:32.029]  He has no idea how to do some of them.
[01:18:32.789 --> 01:18:34.550]  Uh, and they tell him, well, just pick something.
[01:18:34.610 --> 01:18:37.951]  And so he tries to get as close as he can, and then they come back years later.
[01:18:44.430 --> 01:18:56.956]  Absolutely and my father says exactly what you've been saying on the show four or five years ago exposing this and he says it's written to where there's no way to follow their rules and that's why he says so many
[01:18:58.357 --> 01:19:00.259]  You can't follow the law.
[01:19:00.279 --> 01:19:04.722]  Because as you say, if you do one thing, you're in violation of certain statutes.
[01:19:04.742 --> 01:19:08.025]  You do the opposite, you're in violation of other statutes.
[01:19:08.045 --> 01:19:11.087]  So they have you coming and going.
[01:19:22.150 --> 01:19:31.534]  So no matter how careful you try to be, no matter how well you practice your art, you're subject to arrest and imprisonment.
[01:19:32.194 --> 01:19:41.458]  And of course you've got the media on the side of the government who's going to tell the government that you were a crook and you were cheating the patients and you were arming them and you deserve your prison term.
[01:19:42.490 --> 01:19:44.611]  I've seen this happen numerous times.
[01:20:01.860 --> 01:20:03.040]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:13.744]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[01:20:13.944 --> 01:20:18.045]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.
[01:20:18.405 --> 01:20:20.827]  But we can't do that without your help.
[01:20:21.148 --> 01:20:31.998]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at InfoWars.com, you will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[01:20:32.439 --> 01:20:35.602]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[01:20:35.922 --> 01:20:41.565]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[01:20:42.065 --> 01:20:51.551]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[01:20:51.951 --> 01:20:53.111]  The war is here.
[01:20:53.452 --> 01:20:54.852]  It's an info war.
[01:20:55.353 --> 01:20:58.214]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[01:21:01.676 --> 01:21:03.477]  You've thought about it for years.
[01:21:03.677 --> 01:21:05.198]  Well, the time is now.
[01:21:05.398 --> 01:21:08.640]  You need a secret bunker, and you need it deep and strong.

[01:21:31.363 --> 01:21:40.609]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[01:21:40.669 --> 01:21:41.409]  This capitalism?
[01:21:41.449 --> 01:21:47.573]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:21:47.633 --> 01:21:51.255]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[01:23:05.599 --> 01:23:07.721]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:23:08.621 --> 01:23:16.928]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[01:23:17.558 --> 01:23:22.501]  Now, 27 years later, carnivore capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[01:23:23.102 --> 01:23:34.089]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.
[01:23:34.489 --> 01:23:41.494]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.

[01:23:46.466 --> 01:23:49.627]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.
[01:23:50.067 --> 01:23:52.988]  That's 1-866-836-8735.
[01:23:53.008 --> 01:23:57.010]  1-866-VENUSFLY or visit carnivora.com.
[01:23:57.310 --> 01:23:58.330]  Protect your immune system.
[01:23:58.590 --> 01:23:59.650]  It's the only one you've got.
[01:23:59.670 --> 01:24:03.531]  I was a highway man.
[01:24:03.611 --> 01:24:05.072]  Along the coach roads I did ride.
[01:24:13.869 --> 01:24:25.252]  Folks, if I sound upset here on air, it's because since I was five years old, my dad's been a dentist.
[01:24:26.038 --> 01:24:27.058]  And then an oral surgeon.
[01:24:27.918 --> 01:24:33.100]  And he wants to keep working, but he just says he can't be part of this.
[01:24:33.140 --> 01:24:35.160]  They make it impossible not to break the law.
[01:24:35.540 --> 01:24:36.881]  And that's why I saw a statistic.
[01:24:36.901 --> 01:24:37.741]  Can you guys pull it up?
[01:24:37.761 --> 01:24:39.981]  I think it was in the Associated Press two weeks ago.
[01:24:40.461 --> 01:24:45.863]  They had a national Gallup poll of doctors, and they said 61% plan to retire early.
[01:24:48.733 --> 01:24:55.239]  And everything gets blamed on the doctors, the corrupt HMOs, the big insurance companies, who now tell them what to do.
[01:24:55.620 --> 01:25:04.468]  You know, we're going to come back and get into the excitotoxins and pushing aspartame with Dr. Blaylock, but right now, Dr. Blaylock joining us here today.
[01:25:04.848 --> 01:25:07.631]  Get into what the legislation does
[01:25:08.311 --> 01:25:12.832]  Itself, because now, it's not you saying this five years ago because you'd read the bill and nobody else would.
[01:25:13.292 --> 01:25:14.113]  It's now mainstream.
[01:25:14.413 --> 01:25:15.633]  Oh, your premium's up 53% in 2013.
[01:25:15.673 --> 01:25:18.874]  Oh, it's going to double by 2015.
[01:25:19.974 --> 01:25:21.614]  Oh, it is going to make everybody quit.
[01:25:21.934 --> 01:25:23.875]  Oh, it doesn't cover pre-existing conditions.
[01:25:24.355 --> 01:25:26.376]  Oh, it was written by big insurance companies.
[01:25:26.916 --> 01:25:31.357]  Oh, select corporations in Congress are exempt.
[01:25:32.649 --> 01:25:35.831]  On, and on, and on, and on.
[01:25:35.851 --> 01:25:37.832]  Dr. Russell Blaylock.
[01:25:38.492 --> 01:25:42.214]  Well, this is the modus operandi of virtually every socialist government in the world.
[01:25:42.274 --> 01:25:51.999]  I mean, you review the history of how the United Kingdom adopted its socialist healthcare system, it's the exact same thing.
[01:25:52.579 --> 01:25:59.143]  What they do in the beginning, they paint this beautiful picture, I call it a mural, a socialist mural.
[01:25:59.904 --> 01:26:02.993]  And they tell everybody, look, this is what it is going to be like.
[01:26:03.755 --> 01:26:07.686]  And they tell everybody, just keep looking at the mural of where this is going to be.
[01:26:08.682 --> 01:26:13.307]  Disease is going to decrease because of all this intensive health care.
[01:26:13.947 --> 01:26:18.531]  The number of diseases is going to fall dramatically and therefore cost will fall and pay for itself.
[01:26:19.032 --> 01:26:20.413]  All of this was said in the beginning.
[01:26:20.453 --> 01:26:23.195]  The doctors were told, look, doctor, we want your advice.
[01:26:23.676 --> 01:26:25.357]  We want you on panels and boards.
[01:26:25.397 --> 01:26:26.659]  Here, we're going to set up a room.
[01:26:26.679 --> 01:26:31.243]  You write what you think the system ought to have, etc., etc.
[01:26:31.703 --> 01:26:33.385]  So they build all this beautiful picture.
[01:26:33.605 --> 01:26:34.726]  Then it's approved.
[01:26:35.473 --> 01:26:38.817]  Once it's approved, they tell the doctors that they were right.
[01:26:38.897 --> 01:26:41.060]  We're not going to need any of your material.
[01:26:41.710 --> 01:26:42.791]  But you can stop writing.
[01:26:43.531 --> 01:26:49.154]  They tell the people, just keep looking at the mural, and then there's disaster piles in front of disaster.
[01:26:49.955 --> 01:26:54.378]  Patients start being harmed, and tons of thousands of cases.
[01:26:55.178 --> 01:27:00.181]  They tell them, well, you know, this is because there's doctors are resisting, doctors are sabotaging this.
[01:27:00.921 --> 01:27:03.823]  We just need to have more laws to control the doctors.
[01:27:03.903 --> 01:27:05.484]  Everything's blamed on the doctors.
[01:27:06.805 --> 01:27:09.927]  And so this motorcycle rally repeated over and over,
[01:27:10.829 --> 01:27:20.458]  And the historians who have analyzed the system carefully have stated that the characteristics of the socialists is that every time the system fails, they just redouble their efforts.
[01:27:21.098 --> 01:27:23.120]  They never admit, well, it just doesn't work.
[01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:24.281]  Well, it's a disaster.
[01:27:24.861 --> 01:27:26.363]  They always redouble their efforts.
[01:27:26.383 --> 01:27:28.064]  They make it more oppressive.
[01:27:28.124 --> 01:27:29.986]  They add more laws, more punishment.
[01:27:30.887 --> 01:27:32.488]  They try to seek out more enemies.
[01:27:33.249 --> 01:27:36.712]  You know, in the Soviet Union, they labeled them enemies of the people.
[01:27:37.949 --> 01:27:39.411]  And, of course, that's the image they want.
[01:27:39.451 --> 01:27:43.494]  Well, this is not working because we've got enemies of the people sabotaging it.
[01:27:43.954 --> 01:27:45.115]  The doctors are too greedy.
[01:27:45.155 --> 01:27:46.196]  The doctors are doing this.
[01:27:47.096 --> 01:27:51.339]  And the public comes to believe it because it's all paw-parroted by the media that they control.
[01:27:51.359 --> 01:27:54.161]  The doctors have no voice.
[01:27:54.242 --> 01:27:56.243]  You rarely hear from doctors what's going on.
[01:27:56.303 --> 01:28:06.851]  And as I've watched this slowly evolve over my lifetime, none of the stories of what was happening ever reached the media, ever.
[01:28:08.022 --> 01:28:09.403]  So the public is totally unaware.
[01:28:09.463 --> 01:28:10.784]  They don't know any of this is happening.
[01:28:10.844 --> 01:28:20.891]  I talked to people and I said, do you know that doctors are sent to jail for 10 years because the operator on an elderly man corrected his cataract and he went from blind to being able to play golf?
[01:28:21.572 --> 01:28:22.853]  They said, that's unbelievable.
[01:28:22.873 --> 01:28:26.836]  I said, of course it's unbelievable, but I know the case personally.
[01:28:27.436 --> 01:28:29.297]  I've talked to his family.
[01:28:29.357 --> 01:28:33.280]  He has a family of something like six or seven children.
[01:28:34.601 --> 01:28:35.642]  And now he's in prison.
[01:28:36.545 --> 01:28:38.325]  Uh, because he helped a man see.
[01:28:38.465 --> 01:28:40.646]  Well, that's what socialist systems do.
[01:28:41.586 --> 01:28:48.168]  Uh, if you're a doctor and you're costing the state too much money by taking care of people, you're punished.
[01:28:48.868 --> 01:28:55.729]  Because the idea is, uh, in a socialist system you have progressive, uh, denial of services.
[01:28:55.749 --> 01:28:57.430]  That's how they save money.
[01:28:57.490 --> 01:29:03.731]  The bureaucracy grows, and that's where the money goes, and the healthcare itself begins to shrink.
[01:29:04.795 --> 01:29:06.156]  Well, who costs the most money?
[01:29:06.396 --> 01:29:07.017]  The elderly.
[01:29:08.017 --> 01:29:09.398]  The people with chronic illnesses.
[01:29:09.898 --> 01:29:11.800]  So those are the people they concentrate on.
[01:29:11.860 --> 01:29:19.024]  Now, if you don't believe this, go to the Tax-Free Foundation that deal with health issues for the last 50 years.
[01:29:19.224 --> 01:29:26.789]  They've written about it over and over and over, saying we need to find a way to discourage people from using health services.
[01:29:26.849 --> 01:29:28.210]  Particularly the elderly.
[01:29:28.250 --> 01:29:29.851]  We need to deny operation.
[01:29:30.895 --> 01:29:45.000]  They created this system of life here, saying, well, if you have someone that's 65, 68 years old and they develop a bad hip, we calculate how long could they possibly live and we tell them, well, you're not... I tell you what, Dr. Blaylock, stay there.
[01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:46.601]  RussellBlaylockMD.com.
[01:29:46.641 --> 01:29:49.082]  Let's come back and continue along that line.
[01:29:50.962 --> 01:29:51.863]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.363 --> 01:29:53.963]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.884 --> 01:29:57.585]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:02.307 --> 01:30:04.389]  It's hurricane and wildfire season again.
[01:30:04.409 --> 01:30:12.016]  Why do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year, betting their lives that the disaster won't get them?
[01:30:12.436 --> 01:30:17.100]  Hundreds of you helped eFoodsDirect ship 50,000 donated meals to the Oklahoma victims.
[01:30:17.380 --> 01:30:19.282]  The problem is we can't help everybody.
[01:30:19.542 --> 01:30:25.665]  If every one of us who can, will take care of ourselves, we can all pitch in to take care of those who really can't.
[01:30:25.945 --> 01:30:33.749]  The new Just-In-Case Pack from E-Foods Direct is the big brother to the 7-Day Emergency Pack designed for Oklahoma disaster donations.
[01:30:34.169 --> 01:30:40.472]  It contains a 2-month supply for 1 person, or a 1-month supply for 2 adults, or a 2-week supply for a family of 4.
[01:30:41.132 --> 01:30:42.393]  The $320 price is $50 less than retail.

[01:33:07.585 --> 01:33:12.567]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:33:12.887 --> 01:33:15.188]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:33:23.409 --> 01:33:36.177]  If you look at communist art in the Soviet Union, Cuba, China, Eastern Europe, it's basically like the zeitgeist cult movement.
[01:33:37.658 --> 01:33:47.365]  Where they go, look at these wondrous beautiful cities and free energy and all the science you're gonna have and you're gonna work two hours a week and we're gonna get all the rich people.
[01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:56.885]  It's like Grapes of Wrath shows some real stories where small towns didn't want, you know, 20,000 refugees in them, and so the cops would beat people up, which was wrong.
[01:33:57.505 --> 01:33:59.006]  But the answer is communism.
[01:33:59.567 --> 01:34:00.948]  That'll stop work camps.
[01:34:01.768 --> 01:34:07.231]  And then communism killed over 150 million people the last century alone, on record.
[01:34:07.792 --> 01:34:09.993]  Upwards of 80 million in China alone.
[01:34:11.694 --> 01:34:13.055]  In actual work camps.
[01:34:13.135 --> 01:34:17.458]  So, they show you all these newsreels of spaceships and science and
[01:34:18.305 --> 01:34:21.989]  But they're anti-family, they're anti-male, they're anti-freedom.
[01:34:22.930 --> 01:34:25.373]  What it is, is a system of criminals.
[01:34:26.134 --> 01:34:31.440]  And you've got big, multinational, offshore, above-the-law corporations
[01:34:34.086 --> 01:34:36.048]  That on record funds socialism.
[01:34:36.448 --> 01:34:45.095]  And I think that's my question for Dr. Russell Blaylock, MD, retired brain surgeon, and probably one of the leading voices exposing this.
[01:34:45.996 --> 01:34:58.406]  Everything you wrote for BlaylockWellnessCenter.com, Newsmax.com, everything that you put out has now unfortunately come out to be extremely, extremely accurate.
[01:34:59.287 --> 01:35:00.328]  And that's what my dad has said.
[01:35:00.348 --> 01:35:02.030]  He goes, they want to ruin all the health care.
[01:35:02.050 --> 01:35:03.311]  They want to make everybody quit.
[01:35:03.331 --> 01:35:04.312]  And that's what you've been saying.
[01:35:04.633 --> 01:35:07.496]  Now they're announcing they're going to bring in the foreign doctors.
[01:35:07.536 --> 01:35:10.619]  Now the cover of Newsweek says, yeah, the case to kill Granny.
[01:35:11.159 --> 01:35:15.524]  Bill Gates, now that it's lost, says, yeah, we are going to kill an old lady and hire 10 teachers.
[01:35:15.784 --> 01:35:16.925]  And the teachers clap.
[01:35:17.867 --> 01:35:21.130]  Because they really believe that if somebody loses, they win.
[01:35:21.770 --> 01:35:31.478]  Now the communist wavelength, the communist phenomenon has now begun, but with ultra-rich like Warren Buffett sitting on top of it.
[01:35:32.979 --> 01:35:37.282]  Why do we see pressure from above, pressure from below, Dr. Blaylock?
[01:35:37.322 --> 01:35:40.685]  And then other points about how this is going to be implemented and ways to fight it.
[01:35:41.846 --> 01:35:46.990]  Well, you know, the genius of the revitalized communism was Antonio Gramsci.
[01:35:48.053 --> 01:35:57.896]  And he told them, he said, you know, your Marxism-Leninism, particularly your Leninist policy of terror and war and mass killing is no longer going to work.
[01:35:58.376 --> 01:36:13.421]  He said you need to use, as you said, pressure from above, pressure from below, and just gradually evolve the society into a collectivist, socialist country, and it'll happen before they know it.
[01:36:13.441 --> 01:36:15.102]  They won't recognize it until it's done.
[01:36:16.036 --> 01:36:26.666]  Well, if you follow this as long as many of us, like Dennis Cuddy, and I have, and Miguel Ferreira, what you find out is you've watched this.
[01:36:27.427 --> 01:36:31.831]  You've seen this evolution, this slow, gradual collectivism.
[01:36:31.991 --> 01:36:33.072]  Well, we're at the end point.
[01:36:33.812 --> 01:36:40.759]  And that's why this president, who is just a puppet, he's not the generator of these things, he's a puppet.
[01:36:41.703 --> 01:36:45.105]  But we're seeing all of the pieces fall in place now.
[01:36:45.125 --> 01:36:49.027]  They said, well, you know, we've built the structure from below and from above.
[01:36:50.068 --> 01:36:54.671]  Now we're ready to implement the final product, which is collectivism.
[01:36:55.491 --> 01:36:57.752]  And collectivism does not recognize individuals.
[01:36:58.553 --> 01:37:02.976]  So when you as an individual say, well, you know, my hips are hurting every night.
[01:37:03.056 --> 01:37:04.036]  I can't hardly walk.
[01:37:04.797 --> 01:37:08.018]  I'm 70 years old and I need hip replacement.
[01:37:08.038 --> 01:37:08.839]  The doctor agrees.
[01:37:09.557 --> 01:37:16.542]  But the state says, well, our actuarial table says that you may not live more than two to five years, and it's not worth it.
[01:37:16.582 --> 01:37:21.545]  So here's a stick you can walk around on, and here's some pain pills.
[01:37:21.685 --> 01:37:22.726]  That's the new medicine.
[01:37:23.847 --> 01:37:25.168]  People don't understand that.
[01:37:25.968 --> 01:37:31.312]  They're looking at the shiny light that says, your health care will be free.
[01:37:32.112 --> 01:37:35.895]  Well, what's free is the stick, not the surgery.
[01:37:36.415 --> 01:37:38.657]  In their mind, they're saying, oh, I get free hips.
[01:37:39.361 --> 01:37:41.062]  No, you get a stick to walk around on.
[01:37:41.322 --> 01:37:48.527]  The man with the advanced cataracts is told, in his mind, he thinks, oh, under Obamacare, I get free cataract surgery.
[01:37:48.647 --> 01:37:56.232]  No, you get a white cane with a red tip on it, and you can sit in your house and listen to the music on the radio.
[01:37:56.552 --> 01:37:58.474]  That's what you do for your health care.
[01:37:59.935 --> 01:38:04.358]  They don't understand that, and it's what I say, is that socialists paint a beautiful mural.
[01:38:04.878 --> 01:38:08.080]  If you look at the propaganda art of China, it's very instructive.
[01:38:09.277 --> 01:38:16.542]  All the pictures of smiling children, everybody clothed, everybody happy, everybody enthusiastic about their work, but it's all baloney.
[01:38:16.582 --> 01:38:18.543]  It's just a fake reality.
[01:38:19.684 --> 01:38:24.687]  Unfortunately, most Americans are looking at this mural and they're not looking at the true reality.
[01:38:25.287 --> 01:38:29.770]  They don't read, they don't look at the writings of these people that are the leaders of this.
[01:38:30.570 --> 01:38:32.952]  Because they clearly stated it.
[01:38:33.012 --> 01:38:37.614]  Brzezinski, the big new Brzezinski, who played the number one
[01:38:39.192 --> 01:38:40.853]  We're good to go.
[01:39:02.917 --> 01:39:06.998]  And he said, well, yes, we had some totalitarianism, but we've learned from that.
[01:39:07.858 --> 01:39:13.339]  And the greatest thing we could do is continue this Marxist revolution.
[01:39:13.999 --> 01:39:26.722]  So here is a guy that's one of the co-founders and heads of one of the most powerful organizations in the entire world in terms of foreign policy, economics, you name it, education.
[01:39:27.622 --> 01:39:31.183]  And the people he's collected within this organization
[01:39:31.934 --> 01:39:35.997]  And he's saying the most qualified candidate is a Marxist.
[01:39:37.117 --> 01:39:39.499]  Someone who's going to fulfill the Marxist vision.
[01:39:40.119 --> 01:39:41.380]  And we'll tell him how to do that.
[01:39:41.480 --> 01:39:45.863]  So you don't look at Obama and say, oh, this is Obamacare, this is Obama that, Obama this.
[01:39:46.383 --> 01:39:48.645]  And if we could just get rid of Obama, everything would be fine.
[01:39:48.665 --> 01:40:00.452]  No, it's the spring pullers and the shadows, the Rockefellers, the Brzezinskis, the Kissingers, the people that are members of Bilderbergers and the Council on Foreign Relations.
[01:40:02.846 --> 01:40:09.751]  You know, one of their chief protections is they tell the public, well, you know, people who think that are conspiracy theorists.
[01:40:09.851 --> 01:40:10.571]  They're dangerous.
[01:40:10.611 --> 01:40:11.912]  You shouldn't even listen to that.
[01:40:11.932 --> 01:40:13.834]  You know, it's all ridiculous.
[01:40:13.854 --> 01:40:16.175]  There's no evidence whatsoever, so don't even look at it.
[01:40:16.856 --> 01:40:21.859]  Well, Dennis Cuddy has spent his whole life as a historian studying this in great detail.
[01:40:22.620 --> 01:40:24.081]  All of his books document it.
[01:40:24.161 --> 01:40:25.502]  It's all highly referenced.
[01:40:26.522 --> 01:40:28.104]  He's a meticulous historian.
[01:40:28.184 --> 01:40:29.004]  I know him personally.
[01:40:30.618 --> 01:40:32.439]  You read his books, you'll find the truth.
[01:40:32.639 --> 01:40:34.180]  But they're terrified of the truth.
[01:40:35.260 --> 01:40:38.542]  I recently wrote an article for a friend of mine's website.
[01:40:39.742 --> 01:40:43.824]  And the title of the article is, When Rejecting Orthodoxy Becomes a Mental Illness.
[01:40:44.785 --> 01:40:51.908]  And what spurred me to write this article was a magazine article in Scientific American Mind.
[01:40:53.229 --> 01:40:59.672]  In this, the article states that people who do not believe in global warming
[01:41:00.510 --> 01:41:05.254]  Uh, are not only a danger to society, but they're mentally ill.
[01:41:05.434 --> 01:41:07.115]  They have a form of schizophrenia.
[01:41:07.256 --> 01:41:21.367]  Oh, they had psychology today, two years ago, with a former Clinton administration official come out and say, I am insane because I believe there's a plan to set up a corporate world government, which I can watch Davos and see him on C-SPAN saying.
[01:41:22.067 --> 01:41:23.769]  And, and they know full well what they're doing.
[01:41:23.829 --> 01:41:27.191]  Last week, MSNBC said libertarians
[01:41:28.092 --> 01:41:28.973]  Well, it's very successful.
[01:41:28.993 --> 01:41:30.914]  And the reason it's so successful is because
[01:41:59.329 --> 01:42:07.333]  This intrusion into the American Republic has been occurring at least since 1902 in a very progressive way.
[01:42:08.994 --> 01:42:23.302]  They made sure that they infiltrated the education system through the creation of the NEA, the National Education Association, which was a creation and funded by Rockefeller Foundation and Ford and Carnegie.
[01:42:24.565 --> 01:42:26.566]  They set the curriculum.
[01:42:27.226 --> 01:42:31.708]  They made sure the textbooks were rewritten to give the globalist perspective.
[01:42:32.348 --> 01:42:33.869]  All of this is a matter of record.
[01:42:33.929 --> 01:42:34.929]  It can be checked.
[01:42:35.110 --> 01:42:36.730]  It's historically accurate.
[01:42:37.731 --> 01:42:40.832]  But what they tell the public is, don't listen to those people.
[01:42:40.852 --> 01:42:42.032]  Don't look at their evidence.
[01:42:42.713 --> 01:42:44.653]  You know, and I used an example in my article.
[01:42:44.693 --> 01:42:50.656]  I said during the fluoride debate, a professor and head of dental
[01:42:51.337 --> 01:43:06.160]  School told their students that when they debate people about fluoride, or are going to talk about fluoride, said never debate the anti-fluoridationists, because they'll always win, you know, because they have all the facts on their side.
[01:43:06.700 --> 01:43:08.580]  They present it only when you're unopposed.
[01:43:09.440 --> 01:43:17.462]  Well, that's the way they're trying to create this situation now, is that anyone who points this out and says, well, here's the evidence, look at it.
[01:43:17.882 --> 01:43:20.202]  They want to make sure no one looks at the evidence.
[01:43:20.791 --> 01:43:28.417]  So they just discount you as a loony, and not only a loony, but now, according to this article, you're mentally ill.
[01:43:28.517 --> 01:43:30.619]  Well, that's what happened in the Soviet Union.
[01:43:30.659 --> 01:43:32.521]  You know, they used to put people in gulags.
[01:43:32.841 --> 01:43:39.206]  Well, when you look at the Obama campaign posters, they are famous Soviet-era style done...
[01:43:40.507 --> 01:43:47.589]  I mean, it's open, but Americans almost don't have an immune system to tyranny because it's been so long since we were under it.
[01:43:47.849 --> 01:43:50.210]  We're almost like Native Americans exposed to smallpox.
[01:43:50.950 --> 01:43:52.191]  We don't even know what hit us.
[01:43:52.231 --> 01:43:58.373]  But expanding on this, they have articles every year, right at the start of school, happening right now.
[01:43:59.013 --> 01:44:01.836]  That we cover that say there are no side effects.
[01:44:02.297 --> 01:44:04.259]  Anyone saying it is a liar.
[01:44:04.780 --> 01:44:06.482]  Anyone saying it is a fraud.
[01:44:06.522 --> 01:44:08.905]  Well, anybody could read the insert and see that.
[01:44:09.325 --> 01:44:13.230]  And I just think about the writers who were know they're lying.
[01:44:14.111 --> 01:44:18.737]  But who go along with this feeling like they're part of the winning team.
[01:44:19.118 --> 01:44:21.280]  I want to tell the middle class something.
[01:44:21.721 --> 01:44:25.105]  You're always the main target of the authoritarians once they take over.
[01:44:25.486 --> 01:44:27.148]  Especially collectivist communists.
[01:44:27.709 --> 01:44:29.971]  And I want to warn the police and military and everybody else.
[01:44:30.732 --> 01:44:35.853]  You're not going to be allowed to continue on in your way of life once this fully comes in.
[01:44:36.273 --> 01:44:37.934]  You are the number one targets.
[01:44:38.274 --> 01:44:42.515]  Dr. Blaylock, you're a historian in your own right and studied all this with a doctor's focus.
[01:44:43.075 --> 01:44:50.816]  Am I wrong in saying that the fools that open the drawbridge to let the enemy come in and do this are going to be the first on the chopping block?
[01:44:51.336 --> 01:44:53.277]  Well, Robert Conquest wrote a little book.
[01:44:53.477 --> 01:44:57.798]  You know, he's a world expert on Soviet Communism and Chinese Communism.
[01:44:57.838 --> 01:44:58.418]  He wrote a book.
[01:44:59.639 --> 01:45:01.060]  What to do when the communists come?
[01:45:02.420 --> 01:45:04.961]  What would happen if there was a communist takeover of America?
[01:45:05.461 --> 01:45:14.904]  And he lists all the groups, and he said most people think the number one target of the new communist rulers would be the John Birch Society or some conservative group.
[01:45:14.964 --> 01:45:15.604]  He said it won't.
[01:45:15.684 --> 01:45:17.164]  It's going to be the most left-wing group.
[01:45:17.764 --> 01:45:20.185]  It's going to be the left fascists.
[01:45:21.265 --> 01:45:26.587]  It's going to be the extremists who help bring them to power, because they can't trust them.
[01:45:27.952 --> 01:45:34.757]  So all the people out here, going along with the program and helping them out and helping them lie, you're going to be the first victim.
[01:45:35.338 --> 01:45:36.238]  They can't trust you.
[01:45:36.258 --> 01:45:38.300]  And Lenin even talked about it.
[01:45:38.340 --> 01:45:40.701]  He said, someone who betrayed their own country can't be trusted.
[01:45:41.302 --> 01:45:47.446]  So even though we like them, and because they helped us win, once we win, they're the first ones to eliminate.
[01:45:47.466 --> 01:45:53.090]  You know, there's a picture of Lenin with six or seven members of the original revolution.
[01:45:53.651 --> 01:45:55.912]  They said in the picture, Lenin is the only survivor.
[01:45:55.952 --> 01:45:56.933]  All the rest were killed.
[01:45:58.142 --> 01:46:06.364]  And that's true, you know, they went through these programs where they just killed all the original revolutionaries except for a handful.
[01:46:07.184 --> 01:46:23.347]  That's right, anybody can search the term Lenin and photoshopped revolutionaries and they'll see the original leaders that brought them to power, all of them executed, all of them tortured to death, all of them killed, and then later they just put new faces in, and then they did that each purge.
[01:46:23.408 --> 01:46:24.348]  I mean, we're bringing in
[01:46:25.948 --> 01:46:31.272]  A nightmare system, folks, that tramples and you are trampled upon.
[01:46:32.293 --> 01:46:45.202]  George Orwell worked with the Communists, and then worked in MI6 and found out they wanted to bring in Ingsoc, and he wrote in 1984 against Stalinistic Communism, describing exactly what would happen under a system like this.
[01:46:45.402 --> 01:46:52.648]  And folks, that's why I get so upset, is that I love this country, I love my family.
[01:46:53.508 --> 01:47:03.218]  And we know the path we're on, and it's so painful to... I mean, Dr. Blaylock, I know as things unfold and you're proven right, you're not happy about it.
[01:47:03.458 --> 01:47:04.879]  You're upset that you were right.
[01:47:04.919 --> 01:47:06.661]  You're upset that we didn't stop this.
[01:47:07.101 --> 01:47:11.105]  It's not like we're up here saying, oh, we're grandstanding, we know everything, you don't.
[01:47:11.426 --> 01:47:12.667]  We just want to have a future.
[01:47:12.707 --> 01:47:13.528]  Am I right in saying that?
[01:47:14.349 --> 01:47:15.270]  I wish I was wrong.
[01:47:15.290 --> 01:47:18.392]  Nothing would please me more than that I'm wrong.
[01:47:18.452 --> 01:47:23.436]  And of course, that's sort of what's happened throughout my life as I watch this all taking shape.
[01:47:23.576 --> 01:47:25.117]  I kept hoping, well, maybe I'm wrong.
[01:47:25.157 --> 01:47:25.858]  Maybe I'm wrong.
[01:47:25.918 --> 01:47:28.119]  Maybe people are going to wake up.
[01:47:28.139 --> 01:47:29.821]  Maybe they're going to vote these scoundrels out.
[01:47:29.861 --> 01:47:34.844]  Maybe the people will pass laws to protect themselves against this tyranny, but it's just not happening.
[01:47:35.905 --> 01:47:37.426]  So I don't want it to be true.
[01:47:37.466 --> 01:47:38.207]  That's for sure.
[01:47:38.846 --> 01:47:39.866]  You know, I have family.
[01:47:40.006 --> 01:47:50.550]  I don't want them to suffer under this system, and I've read every account just about of the life under these systems, and I can tell you, you have no idea how horrifying it is.
[01:47:51.050 --> 01:47:53.250]  You know, read the book, Man is Wolf to Man.
[01:47:54.271 --> 01:47:57.252]  Every control freak scumbag is given power.
[01:47:58.232 --> 01:47:59.012]  It's horrifying.
[01:47:59.172 --> 01:48:04.974]  You know, all of these people have come forward from every communist system in the world, have written books about their experiences.
[01:48:06.378 --> 01:48:09.080]  And you can't even imagine the horror of it.
[01:48:09.480 --> 01:48:11.561]  Well, sir, I really appreciate your time.
[01:48:11.581 --> 01:48:13.001]  We've only got about two, three minutes left.
[01:48:13.061 --> 01:48:15.722]  And again, thank you for spending time with us.
[01:48:15.803 --> 01:48:29.008]  In closing, the original reason I got you on, what do you make of Coca-Cola coming out saying aspartame doesn't make you gain weight and isn't bad for you, as all the mainline studies pile on, confirming your original research on excitotoxins?
[01:48:29.028 --> 01:48:33.350]  I mean, is this just them desperately trying to stem their sales imploding?
[01:48:33.410 --> 01:48:34.651]  I mean, is this a sign of our victory?
[01:48:35.546 --> 01:48:38.868]  Yeah, they're losing a lot of money on their diet cola drink.
[01:48:39.429 --> 01:48:42.491]  And it's snowballing because people are starting to wake up.
[01:48:43.331 --> 01:48:47.374]  And so they want to protect that $35.1 billion revenue they have.
[01:48:48.334 --> 01:48:50.436]  So this is protection.
[01:48:50.496 --> 01:48:59.502]  But again, where's your regulatory agencies that have looked at this research, which is extensive, and shows this aspartame is very damaging to human health?
[01:48:59.562 --> 01:49:01.183]  I thought they were supposed to protect it.
[01:49:01.223 --> 01:49:01.683]  Where are they?
[01:49:02.530 --> 01:49:09.416]  Well, they're in league with the Coca-Cola company and the Pesco and all the companies that make these products.
[01:49:09.436 --> 01:49:10.397]  They're protecting them.
[01:49:10.437 --> 01:49:11.297]  They're shielding them.
[01:49:12.058 --> 01:49:15.100]  And that's what you see with these so-called protected regulatory agencies.
[01:49:15.141 --> 01:49:19.204]  They've become the shield for the multinational globalist corporation.
[01:49:21.466 --> 01:49:22.406]  You're absolutely right.
[01:49:22.446 --> 01:49:25.169]  Briefly, in the minute we've got left, break down what Aspartame does, sir.
[01:49:26.101 --> 01:49:32.424]  Well, aspartame in your stomach combines to form a nitrosamine carcinogenic compound.
[01:49:33.004 --> 01:49:40.348]  When it's absorbed from the GI tract, it goes to the liver and the methanol is converted to formaldehyde, which is highly carcinogenic.
[01:49:40.908 --> 01:49:51.593]  And it's been shown to produce breast cancers, lymphomas, leukemias, brain tumors, and of course the fastest growing malignancy in people under age 30 is lymphoma leukemia.
[01:49:51.793 --> 01:49:52.954]  I've never seen so much.
[01:49:53.812 --> 01:50:07.896]  So, you have to also keep in mind that the combined toxicity, when you combine aspartame with pesticides, herbicides, mercury, you just magnify the toxicity to the brain as well as carcinogenicity.
[01:50:07.976 --> 01:50:15.039]  So, the more of these things you allow in the food supply, the worse this problem is going to be.
[01:50:15.059 --> 01:50:19.200]  But I've been shocked at the number of leukemias and lymphomas I've seen.
[01:50:21.621 --> 01:50:21.841]  What?
[01:50:23.844 --> 01:50:32.390]  And the cancer rates are just exploding across the board, and now they're putting it in thousands of products, and it just shows the sheer madness that we're under.
[01:50:32.450 --> 01:50:39.816]  Well, Dr. Blaylock, BlaylockWellnessCenter.com, thank you so much for spending time with us, sir.
[01:50:40.076 --> 01:50:40.836]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[01:50:40.976 --> 01:50:41.757]  Keep up the good work.
[01:50:42.028 --> 01:50:42.568]  I'll trust her.
[01:50:42.749 --> 01:50:44.010]  There he goes, the national treasure.
[01:50:45.211 --> 01:50:49.794]  We're going to come back, as I said, take some phone calls for the next two segments for those that are holding.
[01:50:50.055 --> 01:50:51.516]  Then Max Keiser is on.
[01:50:52.156 --> 01:50:58.001]  And then I forgot, because I wasn't told about it, we've got another special guest in studio, too.
[01:50:58.141 --> 01:51:00.203]  So that's coming up.
[01:51:00.263 --> 01:51:01.164]  It's like a surprise.
[01:51:02.304 --> 01:51:04.945]  Can you pluck a chicken in about 90 seconds?
[01:51:05.306 --> 01:51:06.706]  You can with Power Plucker!
[01:51:07.467 --> 01:51:11.089]  Plucking by hand is a chore, but the Power Plucker makes it fast and easy.

[01:51:33.118 --> 01:51:35.779]  To be invisible to the NSA and Obama spying thugs?
[01:51:36.019 --> 01:51:39.881]  Fortunately, there are still a handful of people carrying the torch for freedom and privacy.
[01:51:40.101 --> 01:51:45.564]  My friend Chris Peterson is one of them, and he made a video at PrivacyRadio.com that you need to see right now.

[01:53:50.688 --> 01:53:51.248]  We are armed!
[01:54:05.310 --> 01:54:09.093]  Folks, I'm not trying to spew negative news here.
[01:54:22.663 --> 01:54:28.247]  But communism is nothing but a system used by criminals to enslave people and turn them into farm animals.
[01:54:29.027 --> 01:54:40.335]  Offshore mega-banks, ultra-elite, are above the law, they have diplomatic immunity, and they're trying to put socialism in, and communism in America, which they're exempt from but get the profits from.
[01:54:41.856 --> 01:54:42.817]  And that's the bottom line here.
[01:54:42.837 --> 01:54:47.720]  I'm going to your calls here in a moment, and more of the top stories, and Max Keiser's coming on, the latest on the economy.
[01:54:48.200 --> 01:54:51.062]  TSA to purchase 3.5 million rounds of ammunition.
[01:54:52.291 --> 01:54:52.912]  That's nine.
[01:54:56.094 --> 01:54:57.835]  That's a huge amount, my goodness.
[01:54:57.855 --> 01:54:59.736]  That's tens of thousands of bullets per person.
[01:55:00.877 --> 01:55:02.858]  Enough for its agents to fire.
[01:55:02.878 --> 01:55:06.341]  Wow, that's incredible.
[01:55:06.901 --> 01:55:08.082]  Just wait to see those numbers.
[01:55:08.142 --> 01:55:12.004]  CIA confirms role in 1953 Iran coup.
[01:55:12.505 --> 01:55:15.947]  That's been declassified since the 80s, but now they're announcing it's fully declassified.
[01:55:16.548 --> 01:55:17.868]  Forced mass drugging of U.S.
[01:55:17.908 --> 01:55:18.189]  troops.
[01:55:19.591 --> 01:55:20.792]  An unreported scandal.
[01:55:21.272 --> 01:55:22.633]  That's a very important article.
[01:55:23.393 --> 01:55:25.734]  That's just some of the stories up on InfoWars.com.
[01:55:26.154 --> 01:55:30.897]  Time reporter who advocated drone strike on Assange loves Big Brother.
[01:55:32.438 --> 01:55:34.259]  We've got a video I need to get to in the next hour.
[01:55:34.339 --> 01:55:36.760]  The new common core Obama math.
[01:55:36.780 --> 01:55:37.500]  3 times 4 equals 11, not 12.
[01:55:41.445 --> 01:55:44.947]  That is so absurdist that I say that on air and it sounds like a lie.
[01:55:45.508 --> 01:55:47.709]  Even though I have the video and even though that's on record.
[01:55:48.009 --> 01:55:50.150]  And Charlotte Isserby said that was the plan in the 80s.
[01:55:51.731 --> 01:55:56.374]  Reagan kind of halfway blocked it for a while but, you know, they just shot him and got him out of the way.
[01:55:57.595 --> 01:56:00.297]  I mean, you know, we're going to teach your kids to not be able to add.
[01:56:00.337 --> 01:56:00.637]  How's this?
[01:56:00.817 --> 01:56:01.858]  Oh, you're good government!
[01:56:02.258 --> 01:56:05.920]  I mean, look, they are at war with common sense.
[01:56:06.621 --> 01:56:07.921]  The truth is a menace.
[01:56:07.941 --> 01:56:09.983]  What's the line from The Obsolete Man?
[01:56:11.124 --> 01:56:15.245]  The truth is a menace, and freedom's illegal, something like that?
[01:56:15.325 --> 01:56:17.065]  I mean, it's just so crazy.
[01:56:17.285 --> 01:56:19.886]  And then they grandstand and go, we're the authority!
[01:56:20.186 --> 01:56:20.986]  We're the liberal!
[01:56:21.226 --> 01:56:22.146]  We care about you!
[01:56:22.166 --> 01:56:23.046]  You're not liberals!
[01:56:23.247 --> 01:56:30.148]  You're a bunch of sick criminal control freaks that want to run people's lives, and you've got a bunch of well-meaning idiots following you around that mean well.
[01:56:30.448 --> 01:56:32.368]  The average liberal on the street really means well.
[01:56:33.069 --> 01:56:35.629]  But they're the dumbest people on the earth.
[01:56:35.829 --> 01:56:38.110]  We've proven that with Man on the Street nationwide.
[01:56:38.330 --> 01:56:39.770]  They cannot tie their shoelaces.
[01:56:40.939 --> 01:56:47.824]  And conservatives are just as bad at many levels following mainline Republicans, but at least they think the family's good.
[01:56:48.164 --> 01:56:50.006]  At least they think private property's good.
[01:56:50.286 --> 01:56:54.149]  At least they, on average, will think, yeah, I should be able to defend myself.
[01:56:54.589 --> 01:56:56.330]  Why should government be the only one with guns?
[01:56:58.071 --> 01:57:05.317]  And that's why they're the enemy of this thing, and none of you are going to be able to compromise enough to go along and be part of the future under this authoritarianism.
[01:57:06.616 --> 01:57:10.600]  You're either with the Bill of Rights and Constitution, or you're with the commies.

[02:00:06.208 --> 02:00:06.869]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.529 --> 02:00:08.570]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:09.290 --> 02:00:10.531]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:11.052 --> 02:00:11.872]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.633 --> 02:00:13.573]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.174 --> 02:00:17.836]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.377 --> 02:00:22.440]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:31.556 --> 02:00:36.617]  You know, I put a tweet out this weekend that CJ was bringing up during the break that I can't really mention on air.
[02:00:38.858 --> 02:00:42.279]  But it illustrates that Fukushima is really a serious situation.
[02:00:43.759 --> 02:00:51.361]  And I just said that, hey, anybody that says that Fukushima is a serious situation is a conspiracy theorist and a racist.
[02:00:53.370 --> 02:00:54.670]  Because that's the answer now.
[02:00:56.151 --> 02:01:02.393]  I've had people in public that watch MSNBC now walk up and go, well, but isn't the racist?
[02:01:02.433 --> 02:01:09.936]  And they're all like feeling good because their God has said I'm bad and they associate their personal power with the system.
[02:01:11.277 --> 02:01:13.758]  And you know, when Obama does something, you know, they're part of it.
[02:01:13.778 --> 02:01:15.858]  I mean, these are real idiots, real chumps.
[02:01:17.739 --> 02:01:19.760]  And I don't even respond to them anymore.
[02:01:20.740 --> 02:01:22.581]  It doesn't happen very often that I get the racist thing, but
[02:01:25.524 --> 02:01:27.426]  I'll be in public now and a family will go, that's him, yeah.
[02:01:27.987 --> 02:01:28.528]  Racist.
[02:01:28.548 --> 02:01:30.009]  It's usually white people.
[02:01:30.049 --> 02:01:36.036]  And I'm just like, so now you're valuable and you're good because you're a good liberal and I'm a Ku Klux Klan member.
[02:01:36.096 --> 02:01:36.677]  Is that how it is?
[02:01:36.697 --> 02:01:38.980]  I mean, that's basically what it comes down to.
[02:01:40.376 --> 02:01:42.077]  And, uh, that's fine.
[02:01:42.617 --> 02:01:47.119]  I mean, the truth is, you people are the ones pushing all the race stuff, and are really the race pimps.
[02:01:47.919 --> 02:01:53.281]  Because at least an ignorant racist who just hates people because of what color they are, at least they're just an ignorant idiot.
[02:01:53.561 --> 02:02:02.545]  You people are, like, in a cult of, like, you're in the country club and everybody else is dirty and has cooties, and then you go around, like, with a magic wand, going, racist, racist, racist!
[02:02:02.825 --> 02:02:04.246]  I'm jealous of you, racist!
[02:02:04.546 --> 02:02:05.866]  No, I'm not, I'm better than you!
[02:02:06.146 --> 02:02:07.607]  I mean, it is delusional
[02:02:10.964 --> 02:02:13.394]  Let's go ahead and take a phone call here.
[02:02:13.474 --> 02:02:14.678]  Chad in Maine, thanks for holding.
[02:02:15.281 --> 02:02:15.803]  You're on the air.
[02:02:15.843 --> 02:02:16.104]  Welcome.
[02:02:16.960 --> 02:02:17.680]  Hey, how you doing?
[02:02:18.101 --> 02:02:20.022]  I'm racist, obviously, but I don't know.
[02:02:20.082 --> 02:02:20.902]  Yeah, how you doing, Isis?
[02:02:20.982 --> 02:02:23.383]  You've heard a lot of racist stuff the last two hours, haven't you?
[02:02:24.004 --> 02:02:26.165]  I've heard quite a bit of racism in the last two hours.
[02:02:26.185 --> 02:02:30.047]  Yeah, I just, I had a couple things I wanted to go over.
[02:02:30.787 --> 02:02:40.012]  I've noticed, I started listening to you like eight months ago, the beginning of the, well it was less than, yeah, about eight months, and I've learned a lot, and I really do want to thank you about that.
[02:02:40.452 --> 02:02:44.134]  I also want to thank you for being part of the reason I come back to Christianity.
[02:02:44.615 --> 02:02:45.075]  You've really
[02:02:46.306 --> 02:02:57.395]  Broke down the walls of... You know how society is, they want to put up the walls so nobody can link anything, so nobody has any knowledge, and you've really helped break down the walls so I can piece it together myself.
[02:02:57.435 --> 02:03:05.261]  Well, I know this, even if you don't believe in God, and I do, and you obviously do as well, the universe is a complex place.
[02:03:05.321 --> 02:03:11.887]  The point is, is that we're saying we believe in this, and what Christ said, not what Mao Tse Tung or Lenin said.
[02:03:12.728 --> 02:03:15.509]  Because the state is going to become God if we don't have another God.
[02:03:16.069 --> 02:03:18.510]  So I just tell the atheists and everybody, shut up!
[02:03:18.910 --> 02:03:24.572]  And not all atheists, but most of them, their God is the state, or their God is power, or their God is S&M.
[02:03:24.932 --> 02:03:34.756]  I mean, I've just noticed most atheists are always also, don't like the family, or don't like, and then think we're all idiots because we believe in something else in the universe.
[02:03:35.356 --> 02:03:38.137]  And I'm just tired of being, you know, they're not really tolerant.
[02:03:39.170 --> 02:03:41.193]  They want us to adopt their mindset.
[02:03:41.473 --> 02:03:51.127]  They're on a crusade or a jihad, always telling me that, you know, not that I need to be tolerant, because I am extremely tolerant, but that I need tolerance, one thing.
[02:03:51.167 --> 02:03:53.090]  No, no, I need to not have any views.
[02:03:53.230 --> 02:03:55.433]  I need to let them pour into my mind
[02:03:56.471 --> 02:03:59.354]  Whatever they want me to believe, that's not tolerance.
[02:03:59.394 --> 02:04:00.335]  That's fascism.
[02:04:00.795 --> 02:04:02.377]  And they are a bunch of fascist scum.
[02:04:03.017 --> 02:04:07.422]  And under the Democrats, we're seeing the greatest move of tyranny America has ever seen.
[02:04:07.842 --> 02:04:13.367]  Undoubtedly, it is a full court press to wreck the country, to shut it down, to deindustrialize it.
[02:04:13.568 --> 02:04:14.669]  Closing comments, my friend.
[02:04:15.831 --> 02:04:27.029]  Uh, well, I just wanted to, uh, point out, I guess, uh, well, one thing, I just want to say, you're, yeah, you're a racist, you empower one of my, one of my favorite reporters now, Jakari Jackson, and yeah, you're such a great... Nah, people are on to that, that's my cover story!
[02:04:28.645 --> 02:04:32.248]  It's a cover.
[02:04:32.288 --> 02:04:35.171]  It's like the Dave Chappelle deal where they have the black Klan member.
[02:04:35.771 --> 02:04:37.432]  You seen that Dave Chappelle piece?
[02:04:37.472 --> 02:04:38.173]  That's so funny.
[02:04:38.974 --> 02:04:39.954]  Alright, God bless you sir.
[02:04:39.974 --> 02:04:40.855]  I appreciate your call.
[02:04:41.155 --> 02:04:43.097]  But again, it's meant to just change the subject.
[02:04:43.357 --> 02:04:45.319]  You got a bunch of fascistic control freaks.
[02:04:45.859 --> 02:04:50.807]  Technocrats robbing everything blind, and they just want to just say, hey, stop stealing for foreign banks.
[02:04:50.907 --> 02:04:51.528]  Shut up, racist.
[02:04:51.869 --> 02:04:52.971]  Hey, fluoride's poisonous.
[02:04:53.171 --> 02:04:53.812]  Shut up, racist.
[02:04:54.333 --> 02:04:55.755]  Hey, you know, our country's going bankrupt.
[02:04:55.795 --> 02:04:56.456]  Shut up, racist.
[02:04:56.917 --> 02:04:58.600]  Hey, I think we ought to reinstate the Bill of Rights.
[02:04:59.001 --> 02:05:00.182]  Spoken like a true racist.
[02:05:01.974 --> 02:05:04.736]  Protecting your home with a security system is a must.
[02:05:04.976 --> 02:05:11.000]  But when it comes to protecting your family, your home, and belongings, there's no need to sign a long-term contract.
[02:05:11.360 --> 02:05:17.744]  Listen, there is some real scum in the alarm business cashing in by locking you into long, punishing contracts.
[02:05:18.144 --> 02:05:20.105]  Not with SimpliSafe Home Security.
[02:05:20.446 --> 02:05:21.486]  They're the good guys.

[02:05:24.849 --> 02:05:29.151]  SimpliSafe was created by a Harvard Business School engineer, and it's revolutionary.

[02:06:05.558 --> 02:06:06.498]  Tyranny is here.
[02:06:06.818 --> 02:06:10.359]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:06:10.699 --> 02:06:12.980]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:06:13.160 --> 02:06:18.441]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:06:18.841 --> 02:06:25.122]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:06:25.522 --> 02:06:31.083]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:06:31.483 --> 02:06:35.144]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[02:06:35.684 --> 02:06:39.645]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:06:39.965 --> 02:06:45.887]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:06:45.907 --> 02:06:48.868]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:06:49.469 --> 02:06:50.889]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:06:51.429 --> 02:06:51.949]  It's here.

[02:07:03.928 --> 02:07:11.537]  Why do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year, betting their lives that the disaster won't get them?
[02:07:11.977 --> 02:07:16.642]  Hundreds of you helped eFoodsDirect ship 50,000 donated meals to the Oklahoma victims.
[02:07:16.923 --> 02:07:18.805]  The problem is we can't help everybody.
[02:07:19.065 --> 02:07:25.209]  If every one of us who can will take care of ourselves, we can all pitch in to take care of those who really can't.
[02:07:25.489 --> 02:07:33.293]  The new Just in Case Pack from eFoodsDirect is the big brother to the 7-Day Emergency Pack designed for Oklahoma disaster donations.
[02:07:33.694 --> 02:07:40.017]  It contains a 2-month supply for 1 person, or a 1-month supply for 2 adults, or a 2-week supply for a family of 4.

[02:08:17.671 --> 02:08:21.565]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:25.726 --> 02:08:29.008]  Live from the Infowars.com studios.
[02:08:29.028 --> 02:08:31.609]  Follow us on Twitter at RealAlexJones.
[02:08:32.109 --> 02:08:38.733]  We had a listener who said, let's try to bring back the Google bomb, but make it an internet bomb, and pick one article a day off Infowars.com.
[02:08:39.093 --> 02:08:40.113]  I made it like once a week.
[02:08:40.814 --> 02:08:46.737]  And tweet it, retweet it, Facebook it, email it out to everybody you know, and enter it into Google about a hundred times.
[02:08:47.417 --> 02:08:49.158]  It's forced mass drugging of U.S.
[02:08:49.198 --> 02:08:49.538]  troops.
[02:08:50.939 --> 02:08:52.360]  An unreported scandal.
[02:08:52.460 --> 02:08:53.340]  We're doing the term.
[02:08:55.552 --> 02:08:57.193]  Drugging troops.
[02:08:58.233 --> 02:09:00.615]  And our story is already the top search term.
[02:09:00.655 --> 02:09:08.138]  If you go to the Google web, you'll see that drug troops or drugging troops, and it's our article is number one.
[02:09:08.178 --> 02:09:22.345]  But we need to get that out to everybody to expose how the military are basically being being compromised, being ordered to take drugs, not when they're hurt, being ordered to take drugs and then given drug tests.
[02:09:22.466 --> 02:09:24.867]  It's on record, by the way, to have their rights taken away.
[02:09:25.546 --> 02:09:27.066]  I mean, this is the frame-up of the U.S.
[02:09:27.106 --> 02:09:30.227]  military, and we have eyewitness accounts and mainstream news articles right there.
[02:09:30.647 --> 02:09:33.207]  Now, I want to get Max Keiser on to cover the waterfront.
[02:09:33.227 --> 02:09:37.128]  We have another guest coming in to break down the latest on the mortgage scandals.
[02:09:37.148 --> 02:09:43.989]  There's been big rulings and admissions that they're taking tens of thousands of houses that were already paid for fraudulently, and the courts are letting them do it.
[02:09:44.509 --> 02:09:53.631]  But I wanted to get Max Keiser of MaxKeiser.com, syndicated radio host, columnist, and, of course, TV host for RT, retired stockbroker,
[02:09:54.691 --> 02:09:59.634]  On, because he was two months late, but he predicted what would happen with the bond market, the interest rates would go up.
[02:09:59.994 --> 02:10:01.715]  That's now happened like he said it would.
[02:10:02.256 --> 02:10:03.216]  The beginning of it has.
[02:10:04.057 --> 02:10:10.741]  And I wanted to get his take on Egypt that he's been multiple times during all these different revolutions with the West trying to hijack them.
[02:10:11.481 --> 02:10:18.686]  I want to get his take on everybody from Glenn Danzig to Oliver Stone coming out and saying Obama is a snake, don't trust him.
[02:10:19.826 --> 02:10:22.609]  Uh, and I wanted to get his take on other things that are developing.
[02:10:22.629 --> 02:10:29.396]  The war on the press with Greenwald, having his partner stopped and all his data stolen, flying into the UK.
[02:10:29.416 --> 02:10:30.397]  We're going to talk about all that.
[02:10:30.777 --> 02:10:32.599]  So, Max Keiser, thank you for coming on.
[02:10:32.859 --> 02:10:35.262]  I've thrown out a lot of pieces of info there.
[02:10:36.838 --> 02:10:38.819]  Uh, what do you want to tackle first?
[02:10:39.679 --> 02:10:41.319]  I just want to pump up the energy.
[02:10:41.439 --> 02:10:42.320]  I want to pump it up.
[02:10:42.420 --> 02:10:45.220]  I feel I've been listening to the show and we need to pump it up.
[02:10:45.400 --> 02:10:47.901]  Let's get, let's get, let's get that energy going.
[02:10:47.961 --> 02:10:52.202]  Now you, you, your people contacted me and they said, Oh, let's talk about the Hindenburg Omen.
[02:10:52.242 --> 02:10:53.403]  Of course, it's very exciting.
[02:10:53.443 --> 02:10:57.864]  But the bond market is, as I said a year ago on your show and around
[02:10:58.804 --> 02:11:04.792]  April of 2012, I said at around April 15th of 2013 that the bond market would peak.
[02:11:04.992 --> 02:11:11.701]  It peaked about two weeks later, not two months, two weeks later, and it's been going down ever since, Alex.
[02:11:11.741 --> 02:11:13.844]  So, the bond market is now
[02:11:14.324 --> 02:11:22.726]  Reversing a 30-year trend and this is the beginning of the bond apocalypse and this is the beginning of the massive unwinding.
[02:11:23.086 --> 02:11:30.627]  This is the beginning now of the Ponzi scheme known as the American and UK economies now heading into the toilet.
[02:11:31.007 --> 02:11:31.568]  This is it.
[02:11:31.668 --> 02:11:38.849]  This is what we've been talking about and it's happening now and it's getting quite serious because interest rates are now starting to raise.
[02:11:38.929 --> 02:11:42.930]  Everyone's mortgage rates, everyone's cost of capital and it's causing
[02:11:43.570 --> 02:11:52.972]  Corporations, like you talked about Coca-Cola earlier, Coca-Cola, their sales are collapsing because baby boomers don't want to be poisoned by Coca-Cola anymore.
[02:11:53.012 --> 02:12:03.914]  So Coca-Cola is becoming quite desperate and they can't get the cheap money anymore because for years these big companies funded themselves with interest rates near zero percent or a rising bond market.
[02:12:04.254 --> 02:12:05.254]  Now that's all reversed.
[02:12:05.614 --> 02:12:09.595]  They're getting more desperate and they're engaging in more desperate acts.
[02:12:10.095 --> 02:12:13.776]  And this is why you've seen the corruption in the medical establishment in America.
[02:12:14.156 --> 02:12:15.697]  Wall Street, of course, is highly corrupted.
[02:12:15.737 --> 02:12:28.860]  The corruption now is spreading to every facet of American life, and that's going to only increase because you can't get access to cheap money anymore because the 30-year bond bull market ended, just as I predicted.
[02:12:28.880 --> 02:12:29.640]  Sure, sure, sure.
[02:12:29.960 --> 02:12:31.321]  But I mean, don't look a gift horse in the mouth.
[02:12:31.381 --> 02:12:32.241]  I mean, to be technical,
[02:12:33.401 --> 02:12:39.568]  Uh, the middle of last year, you said by the end of April, you believed that the bond market would implode.
[02:12:40.228 --> 02:12:43.211]  And then about two months after that, it did begin to implode.
[02:12:43.592 --> 02:12:45.093]  And I know you... It started two weeks later!
[02:12:45.133 --> 02:12:47.395]  It started, interest rates started to move up.
[02:12:47.776 --> 02:12:51.319]  So that, you know, that is, you know, that is what I said to watch out for.
[02:12:51.339 --> 02:12:52.360]  Six one way, half a dozen the other.
[02:12:52.380 --> 02:12:53.261]  The point is you were right.
[02:12:53.522 --> 02:12:54.663]  So tell us what's coming next.
[02:12:55.677 --> 02:12:58.899]  Well, let me put this into context.
[02:12:58.979 --> 02:13:07.305]  Had you made a bet against bonds at the appropriate time, you would be up a substantial percentage point, okay?
[02:13:07.545 --> 02:13:11.448]  So that's the key metric always is, what have I done for you lately?
[02:13:11.468 --> 02:13:13.509]  And I want to say, was that Bilderberg?
[02:13:13.549 --> 02:13:19.373]  And I met some of your followers at Bilderberg and somebody came up to me and they said, what would be the single investment you would make right now?
[02:13:19.393 --> 02:13:24.856]  And I said, sell short TLT, which is a listed exchange traded... No, I saw you do that.
[02:13:24.896 --> 02:13:25.577]  I saw you do that.
[02:13:27.058 --> 02:13:30.321]  And that investment is now up substantially in just a few months.
[02:13:30.341 --> 02:13:44.733]  So that's the kind of trend analysis that... So going forward, Alex, the bond market, as I've said, is heading into this secular bear market, which means interest rates are going to keep going up.
[02:13:45.153 --> 02:13:52.980]  And this means that the cost of funds for these corporations and for the military and for all these contractors, it keeps rising.
[02:13:53.440 --> 02:13:56.861]  And so to keep themselves making money, they're going to get more desperate.
[02:13:56.881 --> 02:14:02.643]  They're going to be more stealing of money out of bank accounts like we saw in Cyprus or as we saw in MF Global.
[02:14:03.063 --> 02:14:04.684]  So you're going to see more of that going on.
[02:14:04.744 --> 02:14:06.884]  People just, what they call it, bailing in.
[02:14:07.184 --> 02:14:09.285]  But it's just a confiscation of wealth.
[02:14:09.305 --> 02:14:12.006]  You're going to see more capital controls like you see in India.
[02:14:12.246 --> 02:14:17.408]  They're trying to prevent the passage of gold into India.
[02:14:17.448 --> 02:14:18.548]  So that's a capital control.
[02:14:19.308 --> 02:14:34.377]  You're going to see all the invasiveness and the NSA scandal and the PRISM scandal is all about bankers and industrialists wanting to get together to stop anyone's attempt to come up with anything that would compete with this very corrupt banking system.
[02:14:34.417 --> 02:14:39.520]  That's why they hate Bitcoin, because Bitcoin competes with the corrupt banking system.
[02:14:39.540 --> 02:14:40.401]  That's why they hate it.
[02:14:41.381 --> 02:14:53.164]  So the desperation level is only going to increase and we saw this in the UK with this detainment of David Miranda who is the partner of Glenn Greenwald.
[02:14:53.304 --> 02:14:57.906]  He was detained for nine hours under the Anti-Terrorism Act at Heathrow Airport right here in London.
[02:14:58.246 --> 02:15:02.027]  So they're equating journalism or somebody who knows a journalist with a terrorist.
[02:15:02.207 --> 02:15:03.547]  That's an act of desperation.
[02:15:04.107 --> 02:15:09.269]  In my opinion, the point I try to make is I tie things to economics and
[02:15:09.989 --> 02:15:18.253]  For 30 years, the cost of money has gotten progressively cheaper because the bond market has gotten, was going through this bull market.
[02:15:18.494 --> 02:15:21.875]  But that bull market in bonds has been shown to be a Ponzi scheme.
[02:15:21.935 --> 02:15:22.876]  It's unsustainable.
[02:15:23.296 --> 02:15:24.537]  Now interest rates are rising.
[02:15:24.877 --> 02:15:28.739]  So this level of desperation will just increase exponentially, I believe.
[02:15:28.759 --> 02:15:31.661]  So now we're at the really the end game, I think, Alex.
[02:15:32.389 --> 02:15:43.953]  Now, expanding on this, the UK, as you know a few years ago, said that everybody in Iceland was a terrorist, that they couldn't have their bank accounts, they couldn't fly out, because they were balking at paying foreign banks' debts off.
[02:15:44.454 --> 02:15:56.498]  But instead, the government responded, you were obviously over there reporting on it, by arresting the different ministers, and it turned out 90 plus percent of the debt was not theirs, and they were happy to pay the debt that was actually theirs.
[02:15:57.398 --> 02:16:01.400]  So, now that's been, unfortunately, not really duplicated anywhere else in the world.
[02:16:02.220 --> 02:16:04.621]  To any extent, maybe a little bit in Italy.
[02:16:05.681 --> 02:16:07.302]  So now we see the same paradigm.
[02:16:07.962 --> 02:16:09.423]  Reporters are now terrorists.
[02:16:09.723 --> 02:16:11.183]  Their friends are now terrorists.
[02:16:11.844 --> 02:16:13.524]  Their associates are now terrorists.
[02:16:14.044 --> 02:16:21.907]  And we have a Time reporter, who literally is the spinning image of a tool bag, coming out saying, let's kill Assange.
[02:16:22.748 --> 02:16:25.049]  I mean, even if you're going to kill somebody, you don't brag about it in public.
[02:16:25.329 --> 02:16:26.389]  Michael Grunewald.
[02:16:26.689 --> 02:16:28.470]  I mean, where are they coming up with these
[02:16:29.871 --> 02:16:35.376]  These wannabe tough guys who think it's real manly to talk about killing journalists and whistleblowers.
[02:16:35.777 --> 02:16:40.462]  I mean just a parade of just sycophantic fops begging for tyranny.
[02:16:41.909 --> 02:16:57.579]  Well, it's been now exposed because for years, again, whether it's the rising house prices in the UK or rising stock prices in America, people overlook a lot of corruption if they think they're making money or they think that they're going to benefit in some way.
[02:16:57.819 --> 02:17:06.044]  And then once the tide goes out and people start losing money, then these people are revealed for what they really are, just stool pigeons for very corrupt
[02:17:06.824 --> 02:17:10.968]  Neofascist regime as you have now in America and in the UK.
[02:17:11.228 --> 02:17:31.565]  Now I just want to touch on a very important trend here which we've been talking about for years is in the gold market you know the price of gold has been really kept down over the years by central banks like the Bank of England and others selling their sovereign gold or leasing it to the various banks around the world who in turn sell the gold
[02:17:32.265 --> 02:17:34.828]  And what we just found out, this is really a hot story.
[02:17:34.848 --> 02:17:39.112]  Alistair McLeod of GoldMoney.com broke this story on my show a couple of weeks ago.
[02:17:39.172 --> 02:17:51.885]  The Bank of England was caught having leased out 1,500 tons of gold that now, it turns out, has been sold, that is now in the possession of people in Asia, China and India.
[02:17:52.265 --> 02:17:55.267]  So now the Bank of England is exposed to this enormous liability.
[02:17:55.607 --> 02:17:58.990]  And they just got this new central banker Mark Carney in from Canada.
[02:17:59.210 --> 02:18:00.571]  He has yet to make a comment on it.
[02:18:00.931 --> 02:18:13.539]  But now the Bank of England, after having sold 60% of their gold about 12 years ago to bail Goldman Sachs out, they've now been caught leasing out and then selling 1,500 tons of gold that's not their gold.
[02:18:13.920 --> 02:18:16.161]  They are the custodian for other countries' gold.
[02:18:16.821 --> 02:18:19.703]  Germany, as you know, wanted 300 tons of gold delivered to them from New York.
[02:18:19.743 --> 02:18:21.184]  They've been told they can't have their gold.
[02:18:21.204 --> 02:18:22.125]  Venezuela took their gold.
[02:18:22.705 --> 02:18:36.390]  So all of the gold Ponzi scheme, all of the shenanigans in the gold market where the central banks, to make a quick buck, have been coordinating and colluding in sales and leases that end up flooding the system with paper money.
[02:18:36.430 --> 02:18:39.871]  And the London Bullion Market Association, by the way, has leveraged 100 to 1.
[02:18:40.452 --> 02:18:43.193]  There is now, this is my point, there is now a run
[02:18:44.233 --> 02:18:56.107]  In the gold market, just like you have a bank run, like we saw with Northern Rock here in the UK, there's now a run on the bullion banks, a run on the central bank's gold supply here in the UK and around the world.
[02:18:56.147 --> 02:19:00.952]  The fractional gold system, fractional reserve gold system, is now under attack.
[02:19:00.992 --> 02:19:02.954]  You see two major indications of this.
[02:19:04.375 --> 02:19:05.896]  By the way, you're not the only person saying that.
[02:19:05.916 --> 02:19:06.716]  We've got to go to break, Max.
[02:19:06.736 --> 02:19:17.179]  When we come back, finish up with the world markets, gold, and what's going to happen to some of the different currency trades if the dollar dies, where you think that's going, and then briefly your take on Egypt.
[02:19:17.199 --> 02:19:20.540]  We'll come back with Max Keiser up on Infowars.com right now.
[02:19:20.560 --> 02:19:24.982]  A story that's breaking, that's exclusive to Infowars.com.
[02:19:25.362 --> 02:19:30.563]  TSA to purchase 3.5 million rounds of ammunition, enough for its agents to fire 9,000
[02:19:32.924 --> 02:19:34.905]  400 bullets a day, every day of the year.
[02:19:34.925 --> 02:19:37.825]  365 days a year.
[02:19:38.666 --> 02:19:39.886]  How are they going to spend that?
[02:19:40.266 --> 02:19:42.747]  They'll have MSNBC come out and say it doesn't exist.
[02:19:43.167 --> 02:19:44.687]  Oh, and I want to ask Max Keiser.
[02:19:45.287 --> 02:19:47.048]  Is he even allowed to come on my show anymore?
[02:19:47.128 --> 02:19:50.328]  I know he holds his own strings, or at least Stacey does.
[02:19:50.388 --> 02:19:53.289]  I mean, this is now, they've declared I'm deeply racist.
[02:19:54.650 --> 02:20:00.231]  Killing 40,000 black Libyans at Obama Help Fund, that's not racist though, but I am deeply racist.
[02:20:02.056 --> 02:20:05.538]  For over five years, you've been hearing about the Berkey guy.

[02:20:14.644 --> 02:20:19.907]  But did you know the Berkeys have had independent lab tests done to prove just how effective they are?
[02:20:20.247 --> 02:20:20.728]  It's true!
[02:20:20.968 --> 02:20:22.769]  And he can email you the test results.

[02:22:01.465 --> 02:22:08.434]  There's a huge and hushed up conspiracy going on that's about to turn your lives upside down in the coming few months.
[02:22:08.975 --> 02:22:12.059]  Unbelievably, the media are keeping quiet about this.
[02:22:12.680 --> 02:22:18.487]  I'm sure they know it, but they probably know that revealing it on TV will generate mass hysteria and chaos.
[02:22:19.346 --> 02:22:29.898]  But I believe you should be informed about it, because when the sinister agenda is finally accomplished and everything unravels, only those who know this secret info will survive and thrive.
[02:22:30.579 --> 02:22:34.743]  Go to 123conspiracy.com right now to see the truth.

[02:22:44.152 --> 02:22:47.575]  And it's not just in response to mass murders or preparing for war.
[02:22:47.996 --> 02:22:49.978]  It's something much darker.
[02:22:50.438 --> 02:22:55.743]  Go watch the video now at 123conspiracy.com before they shut it down.
[02:22:56.144 --> 02:22:57.465]  Again, that's 123conspiracy.com.
[02:23:00.546 --> 02:23:06.770]  After 22 years of nutritional counseling, I've witnessed that a lot of illness can be linked to toxins and deficiencies combined.

[02:23:17.918 --> 02:23:19.139]  My name is Doug Diderot.
[02:23:19.299 --> 02:23:22.121]  For years, I had an ongoing rash with itching around my eyes.
[02:23:22.361 --> 02:23:25.784]  This was due to metal dust particles landing on my face in the workplace.
[02:23:26.264 --> 02:23:32.469]  After being on One World Way for two weeks, I began to have a severe rash and itching sensation around my eyes.
[02:23:32.489 --> 02:23:37.933]  This rash and itching lasted for five weeks and is now 100% gone.
[02:23:38.353 --> 02:23:45.359]  Additionally, without extra exercise, I've also increased my muscle size and my wife has lost weight and gained a more attractive figure.
[02:23:45.859 --> 02:23:46.240]  Call 888-988-3325.
[02:23:46.340 --> 02:23:46.680]  That's 888-988-3325.
[02:23:46.701 --> 02:23:46.921]  888-988-3325.
[02:23:47.001 --> 02:23:47.642]  Or visit oneworldway.com.
[02:23:47.662 --> 02:23:48.884]  That's oneworld, W-H-E-Y dot com.
[02:24:23.843 --> 02:24:24.344]  Yeah.
[02:24:26.775 --> 02:24:28.996]  Alright, Max Keiser here in the final segment with him.
[02:24:29.036 --> 02:24:47.763]  Finish up your point on the economy, and what you expect the power structure to do, and then I want to get your take on Egypt, and then also the comical nature of MSNBC now, where they say Ron Paul's racist, Rand Paul's racist, with no evidence, but at least there they have somebody else's newsletter and some quasi-thing.
[02:24:48.123 --> 02:24:49.443]  With me, they don't even give a source.
[02:24:49.483 --> 02:24:50.444]  In fact, let me ask you that now.
[02:24:51.084 --> 02:24:54.266]  I don't know if you've been following this, but they're doing it in a bunch of newspapers, too.
[02:24:55.166 --> 02:24:57.787]  It's a new form of propaganda that's so ham-fisted.
[02:24:58.168 --> 02:24:59.808]  What do you think that is, Max Keiser?
[02:25:00.729 --> 02:25:02.770]  To tell you the truth, I don't know what you're talking about.
[02:25:02.790 --> 02:25:05.051]  The last race incident in the U.S.
[02:25:05.071 --> 02:25:09.613]  that I followed was the race-related incident with the Trayvon Martin situation.
[02:25:09.653 --> 02:25:10.874]  No, no, there is no incident.
[02:25:10.914 --> 02:25:12.055]  There is no incident.
[02:25:12.295 --> 02:25:16.437]  They just say Alex Jones is profoundly racist and is behind the Boston bombing.
[02:25:17.297 --> 02:25:20.340]  Oh, right, yeah, the Boston bombing thing.
[02:25:20.781 --> 02:25:37.976]  Well, the mainstream media has decided that they need to try to explain to their audience why America is turning into a hellhole, and so they need to scapegoat somebody, and they decided to try to scapegoat your listeners.
[02:25:38.016 --> 02:25:41.839]  Fortunately, your listeners are smart enough to not fall for this.
[02:25:42.500 --> 02:25:44.141]  I agree with you, but you're a smart guy.
[02:25:44.221 --> 02:25:45.682]  I mean, you've got your ear to the ground.
[02:25:45.702 --> 02:25:48.163]  I mean, you told us about Grace Ford happened, you name it.
[02:25:49.104 --> 02:25:54.727]  I'm saying it kind of freaks me out, though, that it's so fruitcake-y and so discrediting for them.
[02:25:55.187 --> 02:26:04.412]  Like, that's even scarier that they're that crazy to say, I'm behind the Boston bombing, no proof, and I'm deeply racist, and not even say what I said.
[02:26:04.472 --> 02:26:09.955]  I mean, it's like, that's like, if I wanted to discredit my show, I would do things like that
[02:26:10.675 --> 02:26:11.196]  Two people.
[02:26:11.936 --> 02:26:13.938]  I just don't, I don't usually bring myself up.
[02:26:14.258 --> 02:26:16.561]  It's just I'm trying to get your take on why they're doing that.
[02:26:17.782 --> 02:26:23.767]  Yeah, but you have to compare yourself to, you know, this is why Bradley Manning is going to spend the rest of his life in jail.
[02:26:23.787 --> 02:26:27.671]  Julian Assange lives in an embassy here in London.
[02:26:28.091 --> 02:26:30.994]  Edward Snowden had to seek asylum overseas.
[02:26:31.054 --> 02:26:35.959]  I mean, they're at the burning point of the spear in terms of rebelling against
[02:26:36.539 --> 02:26:36.719]  I don't
[02:26:54.804 --> 02:26:56.126]  No, no, I agree with you.
[02:26:56.286 --> 02:27:03.355]  I agree with you, but I think Coke admitting their profits are plunging and begging everyone to drink their poison and these guys saying I'm a racist is no proof.
[02:27:03.736 --> 02:27:06.520]  I think it is chicken with a head cut off desperation.
[02:27:08.362 --> 02:27:09.163]  Well, they can.
[02:27:09.543 --> 02:27:13.146]  See, let me repeat something here because I think it's a very important point.
[02:27:13.486 --> 02:27:25.416]  For 30 years, every time a company made a mistake, they could just write off the mistake and still be able to finance themselves because the bond market was in a 30-year bond market.
[02:27:26.176 --> 02:27:33.940]  As of six months ago or a year ago, the bond market, which is where companies and governments go to get money, has now turned into a bear market.
[02:27:34.200 --> 02:27:37.902]  So Coke, they can't finance themselves as easily as they were able to.
[02:27:37.983 --> 02:27:39.703]  The government can't finance itself.
[02:27:39.743 --> 02:27:41.184]  That's why the government buys 70-80% of its own debt.
[02:27:42.765 --> 02:27:43.126]  Yes, we are.
[02:27:59.048 --> 02:28:07.295]  Deflect attention, and they want to put Bradley Manning in jail, they want to put Julian Assange in an embassy, they want to put Edward Snowden into asylum, and they want to put Alex Jones on the back foot.
[02:28:07.515 --> 02:28:19.505]  Because they need scapegoats, because they are now in a position where they are no longer able to finance their op... Even Rush Limbaugh, his audience is deserting him.
[02:28:19.585 --> 02:28:21.307]  He's finding it difficult to go forward.
[02:28:22.508 --> 02:28:28.953]  Even those kind of mega, coast-to-coast radio behemoths, you know, it's all coming unwound now.
[02:28:29.354 --> 02:28:38.161]  So, there's more people like yourself... Rush Limbaugh is falling, he's miles above the rest of the mainstream media, from the old Helter Skelter line, coming down fast, but I'm miles above you.
[02:28:38.402 --> 02:28:40.563]  But I get what you're saying, things are in deep trouble.
[02:28:41.344 --> 02:28:44.227]  But finally, you've been to Egypt, you know the lay of the land.
[02:28:44.867 --> 02:28:51.952]  I don't support military mowing people down, and I know that Mubarak was bad too, but they're trying to put the Muslim Brotherhood in that's even worse.
[02:28:52.012 --> 02:28:54.534]  What's your take on all this craziness?
[02:28:55.055 --> 02:28:59.558]  Well, I just saw a headline that Mubarak is now cleared of some charges and he may be back.
[02:28:59.838 --> 02:29:00.319]  Did you see that?
[02:29:01.178 --> 02:29:01.718]  Yes, I did.
[02:29:02.359 --> 02:29:07.501]  Okay, so it looks like Egypt's come 360, it's come full circle.
[02:29:08.181 --> 02:29:09.402]  And it's a tragedy.
[02:29:09.942 --> 02:29:15.825]  And I know when I was in Cairo, and I reported on your show from Cairo, I was very excited by the Arab Spring.
[02:29:16.525 --> 02:29:22.228]  And I really am heartbroken by the fact that nobody came to support the Egyptians.
[02:29:22.308 --> 02:29:25.949]  The Americans left them to die, just like they left the Vietnamese to die.
[02:29:26.330 --> 02:29:29.351]  Nobody came for their help, and now the bad guys are back in control.
[02:29:29.531 --> 02:29:34.974]  It's another American turn, you know, they talk a good game, but when you have to deliver, they're not your friend.
[02:29:35.154 --> 02:29:35.935]  They don't deliver.
[02:29:35.955 --> 02:29:37.615]  They leave you in the American shock.
[02:29:37.696 --> 02:29:40.397]  It's not an American government, it's a globalist government, you know that.
[02:29:40.737 --> 02:29:42.998]  Max Keiser, thank you so much for your insight.
[02:29:43.659 --> 02:29:45.100]  Now, get some sleep, brother.
[02:29:45.140 --> 02:29:46.260]  Thank you so much for spending time with us.
[02:29:46.961 --> 02:29:47.221]  Bye!
[02:29:47.721 --> 02:29:49.442]  I joke because he always says he's past his bedtime.
[02:29:49.462 --> 02:29:50.022]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:50.863 --> 02:29:51.743]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.244 --> 02:29:53.824]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.844 --> 02:29:57.487]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.605 --> 02:30:05.247]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us?
[02:30:05.467 --> 02:30:10.751]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[02:30:10.991 --> 02:30:18.535]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[02:30:18.715 --> 02:30:27.801]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[02:30:28.021 --> 02:30:35.027]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[02:30:35.207 --> 02:30:38.070]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[02:30:38.250 --> 02:30:44.996]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse, but demand a war.
[02:30:45.556 --> 02:30:46.477]  Oh, there's another one!
[02:30:46.537 --> 02:30:47.578]  Another plane just hit!
[02:31:01.778 --> 02:31:14.925]  With over 3,000 years of historic use, Pure Silver continues to be one of nature's most reliable and effective agents against fighting viruses, mold, fungus, bacteria, pathogens and parasites.

[02:32:01.932 --> 02:32:09.257]  Dozens of diseases ranging from the common cold and flu to MRSA and pneumonia are all caused by infectious pathogens.
[02:32:09.698 --> 02:32:13.501]  Fortunately, a simple, safe and effective alternative exists.
[02:32:13.941 --> 02:32:27.511]  Supernatural Silver is a new and vastly improved type of silver solution that is safe and extremely effective against 143 types of bacteria, both forms of viruses, mold and yeast, and a limited number of parasites.
[02:32:28.071 --> 02:32:29.993]  It can even purify water!
[02:32:30.533 --> 02:32:35.215]  Supernatural Silver comes in both liquid and gel for internal or external use.
[02:32:35.655 --> 02:32:47.140]  With over 180 scientific studies by independent universities, hospitals, research institutions and nursing homes, Supernatural Silver is a powerful weapon in the fight against disease.

[02:33:12.990 --> 02:33:15.995]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:33:16.576 --> 02:33:20.743]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:28.308 --> 02:33:35.599]  Folks, we're going to be going into overdrive, maybe even a whole hour today, to take your phone calls on the mortgage crisis in this country.
[02:33:36.300 --> 02:33:40.386]  Because all they've had the state attorney generals do is come out and say,
[02:33:42.054 --> 02:33:43.655]  You can take anybody's houses you want.
[02:33:43.935 --> 02:33:44.895]  No deed, no nothing.
[02:33:44.915 --> 02:33:47.156]  You don't even ever have to own any of the house.
[02:33:47.196 --> 02:33:48.156]  The house can be paid for.
[02:33:48.836 --> 02:33:49.536]  We're going to take it.
[02:33:50.196 --> 02:33:53.918]  And governments are now taking people's houses and giving it to other government bureaucrats.
[02:33:54.418 --> 02:33:57.399]  I mean, it's going back to the dark ages, Road Warrior.
[02:33:58.079 --> 02:34:00.820]  I expect the police to start riding around wearing hockey masks or something.
[02:34:00.840 --> 02:34:01.740]  I don't want to give them ideas.
[02:34:02.380 --> 02:34:04.401]  Actually, they do that in Miami on the SWAT raids.
[02:34:04.461 --> 02:34:07.402]  But the point is, they claim it's bulletproof, bullet resistant.
[02:34:07.882 --> 02:34:10.683]  I mean, it's just, they're going to steal everything.
[02:34:10.723 --> 02:34:11.303]  Just get ready.
[02:34:11.983 --> 02:34:14.444]  But we're going to get to that in a moment.
[02:34:14.484 --> 02:34:24.789]  First off, I want to tell you that tomorrow we've got the Esquire writer whose dad was CIA Section Chief in Southeast Asia during the key time in Vietnam.
[02:34:25.409 --> 02:34:26.569]  He wrote My Father the Spy.
[02:34:26.589 --> 02:34:27.350]  I'm not selling the book.
[02:34:27.370 --> 02:34:27.750]  We should.
[02:34:27.790 --> 02:34:28.730]  I read the book years ago.
[02:34:29.171 --> 02:34:30.151]  They couldn't get the guy on.
[02:34:30.191 --> 02:34:32.212]  Well, he does big profiles for Esquire.
[02:34:32.512 --> 02:34:35.213]  He did a big profile on me in the September issue.
[02:34:36.374 --> 02:34:39.495]  It's like Father Knows Best updated for the apocalypse is the article.
[02:34:39.835 --> 02:34:41.376]  That's the angle that came out.
[02:34:42.237 --> 02:34:49.246]  But the point is that he's going to be joining us, but not about me tomorrow.
[02:34:50.017 --> 02:34:51.577]  Beck, he wants to talk about the peace tomorrow.
[02:34:51.637 --> 02:34:52.178]  I don't want to do that.
[02:34:52.218 --> 02:34:52.978]  I want to talk about his book.
[02:34:53.518 --> 02:34:54.258]  This is very interesting.
[02:34:54.298 --> 02:34:55.658]  Of course, you were in Southeast Asia, too.
[02:34:55.678 --> 02:34:59.439]  We had to get you to talk about some of the Secret Army stuff when we go to Dave Krieger in a minute, but he won't.
[02:34:59.779 --> 02:35:14.183]  The point is, is we're going to get into that with him tomorrow, and then separately, I had to twist his arm to do this, but you've seen the news articles where Homeland Security's trying to buy up all the storable food now, not just, what is it now, two plus billion rounds of ammo.
[02:35:15.483 --> 02:35:16.964]  They're now trying to buy up all the food.
[02:35:17.604 --> 02:35:21.026]  And Steve Schenck, I saw with another company, I called him, he said, no, it's going on.
[02:35:21.046 --> 02:35:22.867]  Let me see if I can talk about it.
[02:35:23.207 --> 02:35:24.508]  He's going to give you the inside scoop.
[02:35:24.748 --> 02:35:25.428]  When is he on?
[02:35:25.448 --> 02:35:25.988]  1.30 tomorrow?
[02:35:26.949 --> 02:35:29.530]  Steve Schenck is on the show tomorrow from eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:35:29.730 --> 02:35:32.712]  This is not a plug ad here, but he'll be on.
[02:35:33.532 --> 02:35:39.215]  Join us and also find the best horrible foods on the planet at eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex to find the specials.
[02:35:39.935 --> 02:35:42.717]  Now, talking about sponsors, Simply Safe.
[02:35:43.831 --> 02:35:45.833]  There's some real scum in the alarm industry.
[02:35:46.113 --> 02:35:48.095]  You need to protect your home and do it right.
[02:35:48.576 --> 02:35:52.480]  You don't ever have to sign a contract for a freebie alarm deal again.
[02:35:52.780 --> 02:35:55.703]  Get the best home security in America and save thousands.
[02:35:56.003 --> 02:35:57.585]  With my friends, it's simply safe.

[02:36:04.552 --> 02:36:05.392]  We have it as a backup.
[02:36:05.993 --> 02:36:07.554]  I don't want to give all our security stuff out.

[02:36:21.781 --> 02:36:25.443]  All one word, getsimplysafe.com.
[02:36:25.783 --> 02:36:26.923]  Check it out today.
[02:36:26.943 --> 02:36:30.325]  And it is our great sponsors that also make the broadcast possible.
[02:36:30.605 --> 02:36:31.866]  And we don't just have sponsors.
[02:36:32.944 --> 02:36:40.727]  I only carry the books, the films, the materials at InfoWarsTore.com that I've already read and I've already found to be extremely accurate.
[02:36:40.947 --> 02:36:49.731]  That's why we don't, well over the years we carry like 500 things now, but it took a lot of time to get those things in there because I've got to go read it or I've got to go use the product.
[02:36:50.431 --> 02:36:53.452]  This book isn't the mumbo jumbo, it's the reality.
[02:36:53.812 --> 02:36:57.294]  Clouded Titles by Dave Krieger, available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:36:59.008 --> 02:37:03.712]  And everybody needs to read this, because you can have a 100% paid-for house that you paid cash for.
[02:37:04.072 --> 02:37:13.741]  You can go to CNN pieces about, you know, where Bank of America foreclosed on the house that had been paid for for 10 years, that was paid for with cash in, you know, in 2000.
[02:37:14.461 --> 02:37:16.403]  And, I mean, that's a real case I just mentioned.
[02:37:16.443 --> 02:37:17.844]  And the judge goes, yeah, you can keep it.
[02:37:18.124 --> 02:37:21.487]  Now, another judge had him foreclosed on Bank of America, so they actually gave him the house back.
[02:37:21.828 --> 02:37:24.089]  But that's when the people were middle class,
[02:37:25.239 --> 02:37:27.280]  And we're lawyers that knew what to do, basically.
[02:37:27.761 --> 02:37:29.802]  The general public doesn't know what to do.
[02:37:30.462 --> 02:37:34.585]  And now, I mean, I remember 10 years ago breaking all this down with experts on it, and people couldn't believe it.
[02:37:35.065 --> 02:37:36.006]  You mean with mirrors?
[02:37:36.046 --> 02:37:39.608]  You mean they've sold my house 10 times in derivatives, or 20 times, or 30 times?
[02:37:40.029 --> 02:37:41.429]  You mean nobody knows who has the deed?
[02:37:41.449 --> 02:37:44.932]  You mean it could be paid for, but somebody else has a deed saying they own it?
[02:37:45.979 --> 02:37:52.204]  In China, mainly, the Communist Chinese are one of the biggest owners, or the biggest one group, and then your house is gone.
[02:37:52.664 --> 02:38:07.376]  Well, we've got updates for you on this today, because I saw a story last week that unsealed federal court documents, we covered this, show that yes, trillions were stolen by banks in houses they never even had a deed to.
[02:38:08.297 --> 02:38:14.481]  So now, it's not just the deed was sold 10 times, now there it is, unsealed court settlement records reveal banks stole trillions worth of houses.
[02:38:14.501 --> 02:38:19.864]  And then you scroll down, it's actually got the source, that's from Boing Boing, but it was actually, I think, put out in the Associated Press.
[02:38:20.264 --> 02:38:29.729]  The point is, it's worse than that, talking to Dave Krieger, so it's perfect time that he's here with us today, but this is what you've got to understand.
[02:38:29.929 --> 02:38:32.771]  Everyone I know, it's not just banking, but this is the big one with the mortgages.
[02:38:34.016 --> 02:38:47.710]  Every family member, my wife who does the bills, God bless her because I hate doing it, my parents, everyone I know, Paul Watson in England, his wife, Eon, has her own bank accounts and stuff, her own job and degree, but it's happened to her.
[02:38:48.170 --> 02:38:53.456]  Everyone gets cell phone bills that are 10, 20, 30, but if you pay it then it's 100 times more the next month.
[02:38:54.096 --> 02:38:55.737]  Everyone gets mortgages that are wrong.
[02:38:55.797 --> 02:38:57.679]  Everyone has their... It happened to me.
[02:38:58.179 --> 02:38:59.120]  Escrow was already paid.
[02:38:59.200 --> 02:38:59.740]  Escrow was over.
[02:38:59.780 --> 02:39:00.401]  They stole the money.
[02:39:00.801 --> 02:39:01.842]  Started foreclosing.
[02:39:02.502 --> 02:39:05.584]  Trying to foreclose, saying that I hadn't paid escrow.
[02:39:05.624 --> 02:39:11.689]  And I had to then start the lawsuit to make Bank of America, who'd bought my mortgage, four down the line.
[02:39:11.789 --> 02:39:12.829]  I'd bank with a little bank.
[02:39:13.270 --> 02:39:13.710]  Didn't matter.
[02:39:13.750 --> 02:39:14.711]  Bank of America still did it.
[02:39:15.071 --> 02:39:16.252]  And this was a decade ago.
[02:39:16.972 --> 02:39:20.255]  Okay, so... Everyone thinks it's just happening to you.
[02:39:20.375 --> 02:39:20.975]  My crew.
[02:39:21.636 --> 02:39:22.516]  All on their lunch breaks.
[02:39:22.536 --> 02:39:23.437]  What do you think they do every day?
[02:39:24.892 --> 02:39:31.657]  They either go pick their kid up from school who's sick or something like that, or go pay a bill, or they fight on the phone going, I have the contract, what are you doing?
[02:39:32.477 --> 02:39:37.540]  Folks, it is a kleptocratic global corporate structure working with the collectivist governments.
[02:39:38.181 --> 02:39:44.345]  And this happens when they bloom throughout history, like a viral bloom, a red tide bloom, an algae bloom.
[02:39:44.805 --> 02:39:49.749]  You have blooms of corruption where they get control of the regulators, and no one's going to stop them!
[02:39:50.845 --> 02:39:52.527]  So they're going to take everything.
[02:39:52.547 --> 02:39:59.056]  You need to understand that unless we unify against them and realize... That's one thing I would commend Clark Howard about.
[02:39:59.076 --> 02:40:00.557]  He would talk about this even five, six years ago.
[02:40:00.577 --> 02:40:01.719]  I listened to him on Local Station.
[02:40:01.759 --> 02:40:02.460]  I'm on 590.
[02:40:02.860 --> 02:40:05.163]  He would talk about, no, no, that's standard they do this.
[02:40:05.744 --> 02:40:08.407]  So it's all about seeing how can they cheat you.
[02:40:09.286 --> 02:40:09.606]  Okay?
[02:40:09.906 --> 02:40:13.287]  And if a little guy double-bills somebody by accident, the feds will come arrest him.
[02:40:14.008 --> 02:40:19.070]  But when it's done on purpose, because their lobbyists give millions of dollars a year, they're above the law.
[02:40:19.650 --> 02:40:24.412]  And Dave Krieger, you know, you've got a long bio, but why don't you tell people in a nutshell about yourself.
[02:40:24.432 --> 02:40:27.653]  We're going to go into the next hour, breaking down all this breaking news today.
[02:40:27.673 --> 02:40:30.674]  You came to Austin to be here with us today, and I appreciate it.
[02:40:31.795 --> 02:40:36.998]  And since you were on with us, I don't know, six, eight months ago, the big developments that have been unfolding.
[02:40:37.398 --> 02:40:39.780]  Well, they have been, and thank you for having me back on, Alex.
[02:40:39.860 --> 02:40:45.163]  The bigger picture, you know, when I started out doing title consulting was basically as a result of the book.
[02:40:45.904 --> 02:40:51.767]  And once we started to do the title consulting, then we found out that there became a need to assess chains of title.
[02:40:52.327 --> 02:40:57.290]  And a chain of title is basically from the, when the owner acquires the house, he gets a deed.
[02:40:57.330 --> 02:41:01.173]  It could be a warranty deed, a security deed, a grant deed, depending if he's in California.
[02:41:01.813 --> 02:41:05.636]  Just depends on the circumstances, but the deed is a representation of your ownership of the property.
[02:41:06.196 --> 02:41:17.064]  And so what happens is when you sign the deed of trust or mortgage, and I know you've been talking about MERS on a constant basis, well one of the things that I do as part of my service is we audit county land records.
[02:41:17.545 --> 02:41:23.289]  And way back when I told you that we were auditing Williamson County, but I was kind of tight-lipped because we were in the process of
[02:41:24.529 --> 02:41:26.350]  That's the crime syndicate north of Austin.
[02:41:26.810 --> 02:41:35.034]  We actually have a county clerk there, Nancy Reister, who cared enough to bring us in and let us do the audit.
[02:41:35.394 --> 02:41:36.194]  Oh, so she's good?
[02:41:36.274 --> 02:41:36.994]  Yes, she's so good.
[02:41:37.134 --> 02:41:40.216]  We actually went through 5,278 MERS-related assignments from October 2010 to October 2012.
[02:41:48.699 --> 02:41:50.921]  And, basically, we were looking for violations.
[02:41:51.321 --> 02:41:56.366]  What we found, we managed to get through almost 1,600, which is 30% of all those files.
[02:41:56.966 --> 02:42:14.121]  We found suspect robo-signing, surrogate signing, notary fraud, forgery, all suspect issues, document manufacturing, where the law firms would appoint themselves, which, of course, drew out two particular law firms, one of which was Bryce Vander Linden Wernick, who, two or three weeks after the audit came out,
[02:42:14.781 --> 02:42:16.082]  February 19th, 2013.
[02:42:16.683 --> 02:42:18.324]  This came out January 29th.
[02:42:18.484 --> 02:42:20.025]  February 19th, January 29th.
[02:42:20.265 --> 02:42:24.489]  They changed their name and their key players have reportedly jumped ship and ran.
[02:42:24.909 --> 02:42:27.611]  We've got proof from the Secretary of State's office from Texas.
[02:42:28.151 --> 02:42:29.973]  Now here's the next- Well let me ask you this question.
[02:42:30.073 --> 02:42:30.573]  It gets better.
[02:42:30.633 --> 02:42:33.936]  Out of thousands of counties nationwide, why Williamson County?
[02:42:34.116 --> 02:42:40.320]  Well, one of the things is because of my relationship with the clerks in Texas, Williamson County said, look, we've got to do something.
[02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:42.581]  Our county coffers are being depleted.
[02:42:43.162 --> 02:42:44.923]  Wow, I want to give them credit for something.
[02:42:44.963 --> 02:42:45.383]  Exactly.
[02:42:45.443 --> 02:42:46.604]  Because they usually do bad stuff.
[02:42:46.644 --> 02:42:47.605]  Yeah, guess what they've done now?
[02:42:47.845 --> 02:42:49.346]  Here's two more contracts for you.
[02:42:49.946 --> 02:42:53.789]  These are contracts that were just signed today by the county judge in Williamson County.
[02:42:54.169 --> 02:42:56.831]  Williamson County is now going to file suit.
[02:42:57.731 --> 02:43:09.884]  In Nueces County, they're joining the Nueces County lawsuit in federal court against MERS Corp and Bank of America for unpaid fees in the land records in Williamson County, which has cost them tens of, you know... Oh, Williamson County's bad.
[02:43:09.904 --> 02:43:11.265]  They're not getting money now, I understand.
[02:43:11.285 --> 02:43:12.847]  Williamson County is now joining the fight.
[02:43:12.887 --> 02:43:13.768]  That's how mean they are.
[02:43:13.808 --> 02:43:14.809]  They'll even take on the banksters.
[02:43:15.910 --> 02:43:19.313]  They won't just kill your two-year-old up there, but go ahead.
[02:43:19.333 --> 02:43:20.955]  It does always seem like it's Texas fighting.
[02:43:32.987 --> 02:43:33.788]  I just can't help it.
[02:43:33.848 --> 02:43:34.448]  It's addicting.
[02:43:35.229 --> 02:43:36.610]  So tell us about all this.
[02:43:36.970 --> 02:43:41.894]  Well, you know, basically when we did the audit, we had to make a presentation.
[02:43:41.934 --> 02:43:43.435]  It's on cloudedtitles.com.
[02:43:43.455 --> 02:43:44.276]  That's the website.
[02:43:44.956 --> 02:43:46.397]  And it's a video presentation.
[02:43:46.437 --> 02:43:50.521]  And basically we made the presentation January 29th before the Commissioner's Court.
[02:43:51.201 --> 02:43:55.947]  And Nancy Reister felt like, you know, it was a situation where we, sure, we're going to fall on deaf ears.
[02:43:56.368 --> 02:43:58.651]  If we go to the Commissioner's Court, it's going to fall on deaf ears.
[02:43:58.711 --> 02:44:00.052]  I said, well, tell you what we'll do.
[02:44:00.373 --> 02:44:03.937]  We'll audit every single Williamson County elected official, judge, and we did.
[02:44:04.037 --> 02:44:04.738]  It's all in the book.
[02:44:05.731 --> 02:44:06.532]  Copy for you, sir.
[02:44:06.952 --> 02:44:07.373]  Oh, wow.
[02:44:07.673 --> 02:44:12.297]  So we've audited all the county judges, the precinct judges, anybody that had MERS involvement in there.
[02:44:12.798 --> 02:44:20.004]  We actually found one of those elected officials that represents Williamson County had four mortgage loans running in tandem at the same time.
[02:44:20.324 --> 02:44:26.210]  And I put a flow chart in the book to show them that, and they couldn't wait to flip open to the section to read about themselves.
[02:44:26.750 --> 02:44:27.771]  But, you know, it's funny.
[02:44:27.791 --> 02:44:29.032]  Explain this in layman's terms.
[02:44:30.093 --> 02:44:30.994]  What's happening here?
[02:44:31.254 --> 02:44:36.878]  I mean, you've gotten the government up there to understand how they've been screwed over, so they're now helping you investigate.
[02:44:37.018 --> 02:44:37.438]  Exactly.
[02:44:37.518 --> 02:44:44.763]  What we basically have here is we have all these banks, way back in 95, started what we call mortgage electronic registration systems.
[02:44:45.564 --> 02:44:51.027]  The banks, the Mortgage Bankers Association, the Fannie and Freddie, they're all involved in it.
[02:44:51.388 --> 02:44:57.031]  And basically what they did was they created one MERS, it didn't work, created another MERS, it didn't work.
[02:44:57.592 --> 02:44:58.072]  In January 1st, 1999,
[02:45:00.013 --> 02:45:01.494]  They came up with MERS Corp.
[02:45:01.874 --> 02:45:02.034]  Inc.
[02:45:02.374 --> 02:45:03.034]  and MERS.
[02:45:03.254 --> 02:45:04.474]  MERS is nothing but a shell.
[02:45:04.755 --> 02:45:05.975]  There's a new release out now.
[02:45:06.255 --> 02:45:08.576]  Explain it in layman's terms, though.
[02:45:08.916 --> 02:45:12.477]  This was done because they didn't want to go actually filing the land records.
[02:45:12.837 --> 02:45:15.438]  They wanted to create a digital system so they could sell it a hundred times.
[02:45:15.518 --> 02:45:15.978]  Exactly.
[02:45:15.998 --> 02:45:17.258]  A counterfeiting operation.
[02:45:17.318 --> 02:45:18.279]  Here, you're gonna love this.
[02:45:18.599 --> 02:45:23.440]  At the same time that Graham Leach Bliley repealed the Glass-Steagall Act, here comes MERS.
[02:45:23.740 --> 02:45:25.361]  At the same, in the same... Counterfeiting.
[02:45:25.381 --> 02:45:25.361]  1999.
[02:45:25.401 --> 02:45:25.481]  Boom.
[02:45:26.841 --> 02:45:36.625]  Out they go, and we have all of these basically... So instead of counterfeiting dollars, you counterfeit deeds, and one house is now 50.
[02:45:37.366 --> 02:45:39.006]  On average, how many times do they sell these?
[02:45:39.046 --> 02:45:40.587]  I see like 10 times is the average?
[02:45:40.607 --> 02:45:40.987]  At least.
[02:45:41.467 --> 02:45:41.988]  At least 10 times.
[02:45:42.028 --> 02:45:43.008]  So what's the real average?
[02:45:43.048 --> 02:45:54.253]  Well, I mean, you know, it could be, you know, I've told people in my classes that I teach, one's coming up in Chicago next month, we tell them, you know, look, they could literally, it says in your paragraph, in your deed of trust, that
[02:45:54.833 --> 02:45:56.755]  They could sell the note or a partial interest thereof.
[02:45:56.795 --> 02:46:05.263]  They could literally split your note into 35 different pieces and sell 1 35th to 35 different trusts on Wall Street, who then take it and convert it into derivatives.
[02:46:05.284 --> 02:46:06.224]  And then they sell it again.
[02:46:06.365 --> 02:46:09.247]  And then they bet against it because they know it's going to fail.
[02:46:09.288 --> 02:46:13.712]  But how do they take people's houses that never even had a deed and paid cash 10 years later?
[02:46:13.752 --> 02:46:14.653]  It's worse than that.
[02:46:14.973 --> 02:46:18.697]  If they can get away with taking a house that they've already paid for, why not just take one they never even had?
[02:46:19.037 --> 02:46:23.998]  Exactly, and the thing is, is the reason that that happens is because the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing.
[02:46:24.298 --> 02:46:25.899]  Which we found a lot of slander in title.
[02:46:25.919 --> 02:46:30.480]  We found one example in Williamson County, for example, where a homeowner had two houses.
[02:46:30.820 --> 02:46:42.303]  He sold one, and the title company and the trustee appeared to have screwed it up to the point to where instead of the house that he sold to this woman, they used his legal description from his own property on hers.
[02:46:43.444 --> 02:46:47.385]  When they did all the documents and everything in the system had his house on it.
[02:46:47.885 --> 02:46:54.367]  I was about to say, I've seen that with CPS in Austin, where they'll use a kid from five years ago taking your kid.
[02:46:54.648 --> 02:46:56.788]  They don't even bring in a new file to the judge.
[02:46:57.108 --> 02:47:01.090]  They just bring in an old one and swear it in.
[02:47:01.130 --> 02:47:04.671]  I mean, that makes like North Korea look not corrupt.
[02:47:04.711 --> 02:47:05.651]  I mean, what do you make of that?
[02:47:05.891 --> 02:47:09.914]  Well, you know, we knew that it was going to come back eventually to bite them, you know, where it counts.
[02:47:10.014 --> 02:47:13.296]  But the only thing that these people understand is when we attack their pocketbook.
[02:47:13.816 --> 02:47:21.001]  There's a brand new case out of California now that's just come out of the 5th District, Appellate District, called Glaske v. Bank of America.
[02:47:21.542 --> 02:47:24.844]  And everything that we've been saying in the book, this case lends perfect credence to.
[02:47:24.864 --> 02:47:27.586]  By the way, you're like five times more excited than the last time you were here.
[02:47:27.726 --> 02:47:28.046]  I am.
[02:47:28.146 --> 02:47:30.348]  You said this just broke the last...
[02:47:30.888 --> 02:47:36.093]  Yeah, this particular news here with Williamson County, it hasn't even made the national wires.
[02:47:36.453 --> 02:47:39.136]  We are exclusive on Infowars.com with this information.
[02:47:39.156 --> 02:47:44.421]  Well thank you, and I should add, you've been in the news a lot with some lawyers that are winning, so you're really on the vanguard of this.
[02:47:44.461 --> 02:47:45.542]  Let's go through some of this.
[02:47:45.742 --> 02:47:47.884]  I mean, keep breaking down what's happening here for people.
[02:47:47.964 --> 02:47:53.147]  Well, you know, in essence what we're seeing is we've got foreclosure mills that are also members of MERS Corp.
[02:47:53.587 --> 02:48:04.894]  And this new piece called Shell Gay MERS Contrived Confusion by Robert M. Jaynes, who's an attorney out of New Mexico, in 125 pages he drills down into the real McCoy about MERS and MERS Corp.
[02:48:05.294 --> 02:48:06.274]  MERS has no money.
[02:48:06.594 --> 02:48:08.596]  This entity is called the MERS System.
[02:48:08.636 --> 02:48:11.797]  And the way I explained it to the... It's a front company like the Federal Reserve.
[02:48:11.937 --> 02:48:12.738]  It's a storefront.
[02:48:13.018 --> 02:48:22.864]  So what they do is they've got this big umbrella, and basically all the members are members of MERS Corp, which has now changed its name to MERS Corp Holdings, Inc.
[02:48:23.285 --> 02:48:29.549]  And if you use the 2009, and every attorney needs to get this, that's fighting foreclosure defense, they need to get this piece.
[02:48:30.029 --> 02:48:44.477]  And it's off of eSprouts.com, but they need to get this and read it because it unveils where James got in there and drilled down even more to find out that the entire issues with where it says MERS on your document actually means MERS Corp.
[02:48:44.977 --> 02:48:52.001]  So that means MERS Corp., which is really pulling the strings, is not represented on your contract, which means the entire contract- Is a fraud.
[02:48:52.081 --> 02:48:53.382]  Yes, is subject to challenge.
[02:48:53.422 --> 02:48:55.963]  So it shows you, oh my gosh, that's why you're so excited.
[02:48:55.983 --> 02:48:57.204]  Yeah, that's why I'm excited.
[02:48:57.444 --> 02:48:59.205]  So, you know, we're going to be teaching you.
[02:48:59.225 --> 02:49:01.887]  But their answer will just be nuke Chicago and bring in martial law.
[02:49:02.427 --> 02:49:04.248]  You know this mafia is not going to go without a fight.
[02:49:04.308 --> 02:49:07.530]  Well, I hope they don't do that while I'm teaching my chain of title assessment workshop.
[02:49:07.690 --> 02:49:14.153]  I didn't just say Chicago because we're on a great station up there, but I've always seen that as one of their targets for my own research.
[02:49:14.714 --> 02:49:17.395]  Well, the CFR likes to tell us what they're going to do, but it'll be a small nuke.
[02:49:17.895 --> 02:49:19.376]  It'll probably only kill like 10,000 people.
[02:49:19.656 --> 02:49:22.638]  They're just going to use the nuke they're going to detonate as a reason to bring in martial law.
[02:49:22.898 --> 02:49:27.724]  Let me ask you this, and I don't mean to get off on a side issue here, Dave Krieger, but let's talk about this.
[02:49:27.984 --> 02:49:33.611]  What would you do if you were this global banking mafia that's done this, not just here, but worldwide, if the people were onto you?
[02:49:33.631 --> 02:49:35.614]  That's why I say they're going to stage something big.
[02:49:35.634 --> 02:49:36.755]  They're going to launch a new war.
[02:49:37.116 --> 02:49:37.997]  They're going to do something.
[02:49:38.017 --> 02:49:39.879]  I mean, because everybody's onto them now.
[02:49:39.959 --> 02:49:40.600]  What are they going to do?
[02:49:40.700 --> 02:49:41.481]  Well, you know what I did?
[02:49:41.561 --> 02:49:45.265]  The day that we did the presentation to the Commissioner's Court, I brought an armed bodyguard.
[02:49:45.645 --> 02:49:53.253]  And when the clerk found out that I was bringing an armed bodyguard, she had the entire room sealed off with sheriff's deputies to make sure we could get through the entire presentation.
[02:49:53.654 --> 02:49:54.675]  We can't trust these people.
[02:49:54.715 --> 02:49:55.596]  We don't know what they're going to do.
[02:49:55.996 --> 02:50:03.358]  We have a dead notary in Las Vegas that testified against London Processing Services, which is an obvious third-party document manufacturer.
[02:50:03.638 --> 02:50:04.479]  She ends up dead.
[02:50:04.539 --> 02:50:05.759]  You know, Marilyn Monroe-style.
[02:50:05.799 --> 02:50:06.919]  Sleeping pills by her head.
[02:50:07.220 --> 02:50:08.020]  She's laying on the floor.
[02:50:08.240 --> 02:50:09.460]  Doesn't make her sentencing hearing.
[02:50:09.720 --> 02:50:13.722]  She's admitted before grand jury to signing 150,000 documents.
[02:50:14.042 --> 02:50:15.102]  She signs the guy's name.
[02:50:15.162 --> 02:50:15.802]  He's in California.
[02:50:15.822 --> 02:50:18.543]  By the way, when you were in Army Intelligence, did you ever think anything like this?
[02:50:18.623 --> 02:50:21.524]  No, I just... You were in Army Security, even worse.
[02:50:21.564 --> 02:50:24.245]  Yeah, it would be... You guys couldn't cook up something like this, could you?
[02:50:24.565 --> 02:50:25.065]  No, we wouldn't.
[02:50:25.105 --> 02:50:26.205]  It's all disinformation.
[02:50:26.225 --> 02:50:27.265]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:50:28.146 --> 02:50:29.206]  Anyways, this is crazy.
[02:50:29.406 --> 02:50:39.748]  Yeah, so it gets nutty because she admits to the grand jury to have 150,000 signed documents within a five-year period that she signed that fraudulently were executed.
[02:50:39.788 --> 02:50:45.249]  She signs the guy in California's name and then notarizes it and then it gets filed and she admits to it.
[02:50:45.549 --> 02:50:47.369]  She gets one count of notary fraud.
[02:50:47.629 --> 02:50:49.369]  She's got a plea to, day of sentencing.
[02:50:49.609 --> 02:50:50.510]  She doesn't show up.
[02:50:50.910 --> 02:50:52.470]  They find her dead in her apartment.
[02:50:52.930 --> 02:50:56.314]  So, you know, and I'm telling you, most of the clerks... I tell you what, stay there.
[02:50:56.354 --> 02:50:57.175]  This is important.
[02:50:57.476 --> 02:50:58.577]  We'll be right back, folks.
[02:50:58.597 --> 02:51:01.140]  This is big breaking news on the Loving Bankers.
[02:51:02.182 --> 02:51:03.022]  Gold isn't for you?
[02:51:03.182 --> 02:51:08.503]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[02:51:08.703 --> 02:51:09.144]  I get it.
[02:51:09.264 --> 02:51:18.606]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[02:51:18.846 --> 02:51:20.026]  That's not what's happening.
[02:51:20.246 --> 02:51:28.468]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[02:51:28.688 --> 02:51:29.928]  If all looks rosy to you,
[02:51:30.168 --> 02:51:31.969]  Then now is not the time to buy gold.
[02:51:32.069 --> 02:51:36.150]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[02:51:36.310 --> 02:51:37.890]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[02:51:37.910 --> 02:51:41.131]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[02:51:41.872 --> 02:51:45.473]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[02:51:45.653 --> 02:51:46.373]  You should, too.
[02:51:46.573 --> 02:51:47.533]  Find out what they know.
[02:51:47.713 --> 02:51:50.614]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[02:51:50.634 --> 02:51:50.674]  800-686-2237.
[02:51:50.694 --> 02:51:50.734]  800-686-2237.
[02:51:50.754 --> 02:51:51.114]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:52:01.798 --> 02:52:02.419]  It's hurricane
[02:52:19.480 --> 02:52:22.143]  Every one of us who can, will take care of ourselves.
[02:52:22.423 --> 02:52:25.145]  We can all pitch in to take care of those who really can't.
[02:52:25.426 --> 02:52:33.233]  The new Just In Case Pack from eFoods Direct is the big brother to the 7 day emergency pack designed for Oklahoma disaster donations.
[02:52:33.653 --> 02:52:39.959]  It contains a 2 month supply for 1 person, or a 1 month supply for 2 adults, or a 2 week supply for a family of 4.
[02:52:40.760 --> 02:52:44.341]  The $320 price is $50 less than retail.

[02:52:54.023 --> 02:52:59.945]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[02:53:00.825 --> 02:53:04.926]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[02:53:05.606 --> 02:53:07.707]  I want you to know some very important information.
[02:53:08.619 --> 02:53:16.963]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[02:53:17.583 --> 02:53:22.505]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[02:53:23.138 --> 02:53:34.109]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.
[02:53:34.510 --> 02:53:41.517]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[02:53:42.197 --> 02:53:46.460]  Call 1-866-VENUSFLY or order from carnivora.com.
[02:53:46.480 --> 02:53:49.662]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.
[02:53:50.082 --> 02:53:57.027]  That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VENUSFLY or visit carnivora.com.
[02:53:57.347 --> 02:53:58.348]  Protect your immune system.
[02:53:58.628 --> 02:53:59.669]  It's the only one you've got.
[02:54:13.953 --> 02:54:15.493]  Don't want no shackles.
[02:54:17.474 --> 02:54:19.574]  Don't want no shackles on me.
[02:54:23.255 --> 02:54:25.295]  Don't want no shackles.
[02:54:25.715 --> 02:54:28.756]  Don't want no shackles on me.
[02:54:32.576 --> 02:54:35.357]  I sit down with Big Brother.
[02:54:35.817 --> 02:54:40.618]  Don't like those horrified... Well, fellow extremist Jimmy Vaughn bringing us in live there, folks.
[02:54:42.490 --> 02:54:44.171]  Dave Krieger, a really interesting guy.
[02:54:44.191 --> 02:54:46.612]  You've got to read his book, Clouded Titles.
[02:54:46.672 --> 02:54:50.314]  It breaks it all down so you can understand that your house can be paid off 20 years ago.
[02:54:51.114 --> 02:54:52.075]  They may try to take it.
[02:54:52.575 --> 02:54:56.097]  And the ways to defend yourself up front, you think the courts are going to protect you.
[02:54:56.557 --> 02:55:00.599]  Many courts will just hand your house over to whoever, because this is a kleptocracy.
[02:55:01.215 --> 02:55:04.097]  A kleptocratic system that's being established.
[02:55:04.117 --> 02:55:06.238]  We're going to do overdrive in the next hour.
[02:55:06.338 --> 02:55:10.061]  I know these callers have been holding for a long time on a host of other issues.
[02:55:10.761 --> 02:55:14.284]  So what I'll do is I'll run through some of those calls to wipe them off there.
[02:55:15.224 --> 02:55:17.266]  Alex and John and Steve and Ed and Robert.
[02:55:17.706 --> 02:55:24.530]  And then we'll open the phones up, specifically all calls after that, for Dave Krieger to talk about this big breaking news.
[02:55:24.550 --> 02:55:29.093]  But the book, Clouded Titles, available at InfoWarsTore.com or by calling toll free 888.
[02:55:29.974 --> 02:55:30.574]  2-5-3-3-1-3-9.
[02:55:30.594 --> 02:55:32.975]  All right, Dave, you've got the floor.
[02:55:33.015 --> 02:55:33.835]  Continue here.
[02:55:34.356 --> 02:55:37.397]  Breaking down for people how big this is.
[02:55:37.937 --> 02:55:42.358]  And there's also other lawyers and other researchers having victories as well.
[02:55:42.959 --> 02:55:47.940]  But I've also seen where attorney generals are trying to get laws changed to let the banks do this.
[02:55:47.980 --> 02:55:51.602]  Well, if they do that, the confidence in the free market economy is done.
[02:55:51.982 --> 02:55:54.803]  That'll even ruin things worse than their scam.
[02:55:54.823 --> 02:55:57.624]  So it looks like they're in a rock and a hard place here.
[02:55:58.024 --> 02:56:04.711]  Well, the bigger picture, Alex, is that when you've got, again, you remember the attacks they did on Lanny Breuer, the assistant AG, AUSA?
[02:56:05.051 --> 02:56:05.292]  Yeah.
[02:56:05.772 --> 02:56:15.102]  He basically, you know, dismissed them and then went back to work for the company that represents MERS Corp, the bunch that made the electronic database.
[02:56:15.182 --> 02:56:19.646]  Lanny Breuer and Eric Holder, the current AG of the United States, worked for
[02:56:20.751 --> 02:56:22.213]  Cummington & Burling in D.C.
[02:56:22.253 --> 02:56:22.813]  It's a D.C.
[02:56:22.853 --> 02:56:39.431]  law firm that represents MERS Corp Holdings, which is basically the large... And I've read that as long as you hire them, but it's like by invitation, then you're allowed to not pay taxes, you're allowed to be offshore, but it's got to be certified by them, and then that's like a made firm.
[02:56:39.511 --> 02:56:39.852]  Boom.
[02:56:40.112 --> 02:56:41.614]  When they do it, you're now in the gang.
[02:56:41.934 --> 02:56:47.581]  Well, you know, you wonder why the banks aren't being prosecuted, and it's because the AG has ties to the banks, and that's how.
[02:56:47.882 --> 02:56:48.963]  Through Covington and Burling.
[02:56:49.304 --> 02:56:51.546]  That's the assessed situation.
[02:56:51.567 --> 02:56:53.289]  It's like the Pelican Brief, literally.
[02:56:54.030 --> 02:56:56.253]  It almost is, except nobody's car's blown up yet.
[02:56:57.284 --> 02:56:58.024]  Well, keep going.
[02:56:58.405 --> 02:56:58.685]  All right.
[02:56:58.745 --> 02:57:07.429]  Well, anyway, so the bigger picture, and you were alluding to the fact that you could have a house at any time and all of a sudden you get a notice on the door and somebody's foreclosing on you.
[02:57:07.689 --> 02:57:13.431]  This is not an uncommon thing and it's not going to be an uncommon thing because the left hand didn't know what the right hand was doing.
[02:57:13.872 --> 02:57:20.835]  You have all these intervening assignees in the chain of title because they jumped and they left the land records when the first mortgage or deed of trust was recorded.
[02:57:21.415 --> 02:57:23.556]  Which was the security instrument that you signed.
[02:57:23.976 --> 02:57:25.637]  You signed a note and a deed of trust.
[02:57:25.997 --> 02:57:30.179]  Well, they take the deed of trust, they leave it in the land records, and the note goes out into Wall Street.
[02:57:30.199 --> 02:57:32.180]  And they literally could split it up into 35 different pieces.
[02:57:33.712 --> 02:57:37.455]  So it's the original transaction that's the real law.
[02:57:37.795 --> 02:57:38.936]  Everything else is fraud.
[02:57:39.376 --> 02:57:43.899]  Everything else passed out is not recorded in the land records and therefore we don't know who actually owns your house.
[02:57:44.299 --> 02:57:55.707]  And then the MERS system, which disclaims itself for accuracy on the website, where homeowners are supposed to be able to go look this stuff up, well what actually happens is the MERS court members are putting on there what they want you to see.
[02:57:56.227 --> 02:57:57.108]  It may not be the truth.
[02:57:57.648 --> 02:58:00.389]  So it's basically a big obfuscation and smokescreen.
[02:58:00.509 --> 02:58:06.630]  Why would the establishment endanger the entire world political and financial system with a fraud this big?
[02:58:06.670 --> 02:58:14.052]  The only thing I can think of that comes to mind, and you know, God forbid it would be happening here, but the massive, the biggest massive land grab in American history.
[02:58:14.572 --> 02:58:22.334]  And they all did it starting with the derivatives markets back in, you know, 2001, 2002, and it just spiked in 2008 and then it collapsed.
[02:58:22.754 --> 02:58:25.335]  Let's explain that because I have a news article here today
[02:58:26.175 --> 02:58:28.617]  Out of the Association of Corporate Council.
[02:58:29.157 --> 02:58:32.080]  City attempting to seize underwater mortgages via eminent domain.
[02:58:32.600 --> 02:58:33.841]  Constitutional objections.
[02:58:33.901 --> 02:58:35.122]  Potential investor losses.
[02:58:35.162 --> 02:58:35.362]  Yeah.
[02:58:35.642 --> 02:58:38.865]  Bankrupt the national housing system and then nationalize it.
[02:58:39.125 --> 02:58:39.846]  We'll be right back.
[02:58:39.886 --> 02:58:40.426]  That's the plan.
[02:58:51.872 --> 02:58:54.635]  Protecting your home with a security system is a must.
[02:58:54.875 --> 02:59:00.901]  But when it comes to protecting your family, your home, and belongings, there's no need to sign a long-term contract.
[02:59:01.261 --> 02:59:07.647]  Listen, there is some real scum in the alarm business cashing in by locking you into long, punishing contracts.
[02:59:08.047 --> 02:59:09.988]  Not with SimpliSafe Home Security.
[02:59:10.329 --> 02:59:11.369]  They're the good guys.

[02:59:53.891 --> 02:59:55.312]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.932 --> 02:59:59.153]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:06.107 --> 03:00:10.311]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:00:10.951 --> 03:00:11.752]  You want answers?
[03:00:12.533 --> 03:00:13.434]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:14.074 --> 03:00:17.697]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:18.278 --> 03:00:22.382]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:28.467 --> 03:00:30.889]  Clowning Channels by David Kringer is the book.
[03:00:31.860 --> 03:00:33.061]  He's here with us in studio.
[03:00:33.121 --> 03:00:34.663]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:00:35.063 --> 03:00:36.585]  I know we've had folks holding for like an hour.
[03:00:36.605 --> 03:00:44.793]  We're going to get through these calls real quick on a host of issues, then take calls specifically on the mortgage fraud and where it's all going.
[03:00:44.813 --> 03:00:47.335]  And it's not just in this country, though we're the epicenter.
[03:00:47.355 --> 03:00:51.059]  And we'll talk about how do they think they'd get away with it, because these big corporate swindlers...
[03:00:52.415 --> 03:00:55.237]  And the law firms that work for him, they always have a long-term plan.
[03:00:55.617 --> 03:00:58.959]  And they've got something that they're going to make money out of the crisis later on.
[03:00:59.419 --> 03:01:01.420]  So we'll ask Dave Krieger about that coming up.
[03:01:01.801 --> 03:01:05.463]  Right now, Alex in Chile, thank you for holding down there in South America.
[03:01:06.083 --> 03:01:06.844]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[03:01:08.101 --> 03:01:09.102]  Hey, how's it going?
[03:01:11.063 --> 03:01:27.693]  Your website is just a great clearinghouse for a lot of information, and now that you have the reach through Drudge Report, you're reaching millions and millions of people, and I've heard you complain yourself that you have so much news going on, and you try to red-link so much, but just as every single new news point comes out, it keeps getting knocked down further and further in the list.
[03:01:28.594 --> 03:01:33.517]  And what I was thinking is, and this would be a great opportunity to crowdsource a lot of your dedicated listeners,
[03:01:34.723 --> 03:01:39.464]  Uh, and that is to add a link, uh, to the top of your webpage called, Don't Believe Me?
[03:01:39.664 --> 03:01:53.488]  And on that page, you can have crowdsourced, uh, listeners, uh, put together the different issues that people think that they should just dismiss out of hand as, uh, conspiracy theory, but have links, uh, you know, quick description of what the issue is, and then have links to the, uh,
[03:01:54.148 --> 03:01:56.929]  No, I mean, that's all great, but I mean, I've made films.
[03:01:57.090 --> 03:02:00.671]  Anybody can type in, you know, Soviets and then Nazis using fluoride to control crowds.
[03:02:00.771 --> 03:02:03.573]  That's like a Pulitzer Prize winning book has all that info from Nuremberg.
[03:02:03.593 --> 03:02:04.173]  You can type in
[03:02:20.435 --> 03:02:21.697]  Uh, I don't know, FEMA training manual?
[03:02:36.411 --> 03:02:37.972]  But, I mean, which FEMA training manual?
[03:02:37.992 --> 03:02:41.874]  You've got the FEMA camp re-education camp center stuff.
[03:02:42.294 --> 03:02:44.235]  You've got the Emergency Centers Establishment Act.
[03:02:44.275 --> 03:02:46.476]  You've got the Civilian Inmate Labor Camp Program.
[03:02:47.477 --> 03:02:51.259]  You've got the Army manual for re-education camps.
[03:02:51.279 --> 03:02:52.760]  You just type that in, you'll be at army.mil.
[03:02:53.800 --> 03:03:05.751]  That's what's so frustrating for me, and I appreciate your call, is that this stuff is so unbelievable, but everybody always says, I heard on Alex Jones, even though we give them the source.
[03:03:05.771 --> 03:03:07.792]  I bet you run into this a lot.
[03:03:07.893 --> 03:03:09.134]  I still hear people saying, really?
[03:03:09.614 --> 03:03:11.635]  They're taking people's houses that have been paid for?
[03:03:11.655 --> 03:03:14.837]  I mean, people just don't get that this type of corruption is going on.
[03:03:15.137 --> 03:03:17.998]  Well, it's because the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing.
[03:03:18.018 --> 03:03:27.523]  And after you have all of these people that have, you know, literally pledged their property into the system, and the system has taken these notes and converted them into derivatives.
[03:03:27.863 --> 03:03:35.647]  I mean, the banks from 2003 to 2008 reportedly made $53 trillion making side bets called credit default swaps.
[03:03:36.027 --> 03:03:53.113]  And literally they, you know, the sad thing about it is they structured the loans, it appears, to fail and then they turn around and I mean that's where videos like Inside Job, which I know you carry and I know you've seen, came about, you know, that Ferguson created and directed because of the fact that, you know, you start to see the bigger picture.
[03:03:53.673 --> 03:04:03.559]  But then when you see the fact that you have all these intervening assignees, what's to stop them from coming in down the road and saying, hey, didn't we have a piece of this guy's house at one time?
[03:04:04.019 --> 03:04:05.500]  I don't think we've ever collected on it.
[03:04:05.740 --> 03:04:06.360]  Let's go get it.
[03:04:06.380 --> 03:04:17.247]  And then they hire a law firm and boom, we've got... And what they're going to do is create a big national office that taxes all homeowners to then pay homeowners back or to pay the assignees
[03:04:17.907 --> 03:04:22.872]  That's they bankrupt healthcare to socialize it, but with corporate groups profiting from it.
[03:04:23.193 --> 03:04:23.894]  It's fascism.
[03:04:24.394 --> 03:04:31.322]  And that's what I've gotten from all our sources is they plan on bankrupting the free market private property system in this country.
[03:04:31.362 --> 03:04:34.265]  Well, what really, really bothers me is this new PATH Act.
[03:04:34.505 --> 03:04:35.405]  That's going on right now.
[03:04:35.425 --> 03:04:36.766]  Let's explain that when we come back.
[03:04:37.186 --> 03:04:39.346]  And look, I apologize to all the callers.
[03:04:39.366 --> 03:04:42.747]  I'm going to have to wipe the board because it's not going to make sense going off into all this.
[03:04:42.787 --> 03:04:44.127]  So you guys can call back tomorrow.
[03:04:44.467 --> 03:04:48.328]  I'm going to open the phones up right now for people that have specific questions for David Krieger.
[03:04:48.368 --> 03:04:49.128]  Straight ahead at 800-259-9231.
[03:04:49.148 --> 03:04:49.208]  800-259-9231.
[03:04:49.248 --> 03:04:50.449]  We're in overdrive.
[03:04:50.469 --> 03:04:51.349]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[03:04:51.369 --> 03:04:52.269]  InfoWars.com while it's still there.
[03:05:01.661 --> 03:05:02.841]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:03.101 --> 03:05:13.523]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[03:05:13.763 --> 03:05:20.705]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats, but we can't do that without your help.
[03:05:20.965 --> 03:05:28.486]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at InfoWars.com, you will wake up people in your area and support
[03:05:28.826 --> 03:05:31.787]  Our operation as we move to the next level.
[03:05:32.227 --> 03:05:35.508]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[03:05:35.728 --> 03:05:41.330]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[03:05:41.870 --> 03:05:51.273]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[03:05:51.753 --> 03:05:52.954]  The war is here.
[03:05:53.254 --> 03:05:54.755]  It's an info war.
[03:05:55.136 --> 03:06:00.940]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[03:06:01.841 --> 03:06:06.705]  There are those curious about bitcoins and those using and making money with bitcoins.
[03:06:07.185 --> 03:06:08.386]  What are bitcoins?
[03:06:08.826 --> 03:06:14.831]  A bitcoin is the first decentralized currency that can be easily transferred from person to person over the internet.
[03:06:15.291 --> 03:06:16.732]  No bank needed.
[03:06:17.112 --> 03:06:22.396]  This means lower fees and accounts can never be frozen, limited or closed.
[03:06:22.796 --> 03:06:24.617]  You are in control of your money.
[03:06:25.077 --> 03:06:25.858]  And the best part?
[03:06:26.238 --> 03:06:29.460]  You can start earning and making money with bitcoins right away.
[03:06:29.860 --> 03:06:37.245]  No computer or expertise is required to earn money with bitcoins and a growing number of merchants now accept bitcoins.
[03:06:37.685 --> 03:06:41.427]  Plus, they're easily exchanged for dollars, euros, and more.

[03:07:54.715 --> 03:07:57.337]  Spelled L-E-C-I-G.com.
[03:07:57.577 --> 03:08:00.559]  Lecig e-cigarettes for today's modern smoker.
[03:08:02.921 --> 03:08:08.946]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:09.566 --> 03:08:12.549]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:14.983 --> 03:08:18.608]  That's right, Dave Krieger's laughing in our Central Texas Command Center line.
[03:08:18.648 --> 03:08:19.569]  But it's true.
[03:08:20.190 --> 03:08:25.457]  We're here trying to run the media operation against the globalists from little old Austin, Texas.
[03:08:25.537 --> 03:08:31.045]  And we are about the best there is, which is pretty darn scary in the final equation.
[03:08:32.526 --> 03:08:37.488]  They say a lie goes around the world before the truth puts on its shoes, but in the end, the truth will out.
[03:08:37.949 --> 03:08:41.630]  Man, during the breaks, you just want a case against these guys.
[03:08:41.650 --> 03:08:43.431]  There's a lot of other cases getting won.
[03:08:44.071 --> 03:08:49.994]  So there is some still basic law out there, but now they're trying to come in and create something other than mirrors.
[03:08:51.134 --> 03:08:53.915]  Before we go to these calls, give people a lay of the land.
[03:08:53.935 --> 03:08:55.936]  And some people say, well, I rent.
[03:08:55.956 --> 03:08:56.877]  I don't care about a mortgage.
[03:08:57.797 --> 03:09:00.299]  This is the entire underpinning of the economic system.
[03:09:00.779 --> 03:09:03.861]  So I don't see how they're going to unwind it, how they're going to stop it.
[03:09:04.221 --> 03:09:06.122]  But if they don't stop it, it'll destroy everybody.
[03:09:06.603 --> 03:09:08.304]  If they do stop it, it'll destroy everybody.
[03:09:08.344 --> 03:09:09.525]  I mean, where does this end?
[03:09:10.550 --> 03:09:13.713]  There is no end until they actually shut the entire system down.
[03:09:13.773 --> 03:09:20.818]  Elizabeth Warren right now is spearheading an effort to reinstate Glass-Steagall to get the banks out of the securities business completely.
[03:09:20.978 --> 03:09:31.426]  So it's just, you know, it's one of those things that when we look at the bigger picture and you see everything that's going on in Congress right now, and you know about all these laws they pass.
[03:09:31.486 --> 03:09:32.066]  Oh, here we go.
[03:09:32.407 --> 03:09:32.707]  All right.
[03:09:34.868 --> 03:09:37.010]  For TV viewers, I decided to have
[03:09:38.691 --> 03:09:42.732]  Equal time today, so President Obama will be part of the show with us here.
[03:09:43.333 --> 03:09:45.813]  For those who don't know, I am Barack Obama.
[03:09:46.174 --> 03:09:51.035]  You can believe me, I will not raise your payroll tax, not your income tax, not one dime.
[03:09:51.915 --> 03:09:54.176]  And the health care plan does not have death panels.
[03:09:55.276 --> 03:09:55.837]  I love you.
[03:09:55.857 --> 03:09:57.237]  I love you.
[03:09:57.477 --> 03:09:58.157]  Go ahead Dave.
[03:09:58.177 --> 03:10:05.860]  Mr. President, I'd like to ask you, Mr. Mock President, whether or not you're going to sign this PATH Act into law if it comes on your desk.
[03:10:07.028 --> 03:10:09.209]  Well, my friend Bill Clinton's going to help me out.
[03:10:09.649 --> 03:10:10.890]  Tell folks about the PATH Act.
[03:10:11.130 --> 03:10:22.174]  Well, the PATH Act basically, it goes to the, what it claims to be the very core of the issue, but if you read in the back pages, and already Professor Adam Levinson, who I know you know,
[03:10:22.774 --> 03:10:23.014]  I don't
[03:10:40.788 --> 03:10:49.950]  That the biggest part of the problem is, is the creation of a national mortgage registry, which all of my people that are writing in and that have read the book seem to think that they're going to codify MERS.
[03:10:49.970 --> 03:10:52.951]  Well, the problem is, MERS is a privately held corporation.
[03:10:53.231 --> 03:10:57.852]  This is a national database maintained by a non-profit organization.
[03:10:59.172 --> 03:11:01.213]  Who's going to control that non-profit organization?
[03:11:01.253 --> 03:11:02.333]  Guess who gets to set it up?
[03:11:02.653 --> 03:11:03.673]  The FHFA.
[03:11:04.794 --> 03:11:06.314]  You know, Fannie and Freddie's conservator?
[03:11:07.113 --> 03:11:07.694]  Just what I need.
[03:11:07.734 --> 03:11:09.555]  I feel so safe with a conservator like that.
[03:11:09.575 --> 03:11:13.099]  You know, criticizing Banks sounds like racist talk to me.
[03:11:13.119 --> 03:11:17.043]  I think we need to get Dave Krueger, MSNBC, racist, racist.
[03:11:20.762 --> 03:11:23.043]  You're not behind the Boston bombing, are you?
[03:11:23.063 --> 03:11:23.103]  No.
[03:11:23.523 --> 03:11:24.364]  Can't say that I am.
[03:11:25.244 --> 03:11:26.525]  I don't know a very good Obama.
[03:11:27.025 --> 03:11:27.325]  No, no.
[03:11:27.345 --> 03:11:29.066]  They're getting so desperate now, being serious.
[03:11:29.426 --> 03:11:33.408]  They're coming out and saying it's racist to criticize anything the government does.
[03:11:33.428 --> 03:11:34.188]  Have you heard that new thing?
[03:11:34.448 --> 03:11:36.009]  I have, as a matter of fact.
[03:11:36.349 --> 03:11:37.810]  It's up on your screen, too, behind you.
[03:11:37.930 --> 03:11:43.032]  But the bigger picture is, if this thing passes, people are confused.
[03:11:43.052 --> 03:11:45.933]  You know, when you look at a mortgage, people need to understand what mortgages are.
[03:11:46.433 --> 03:11:49.455]  Mortgages are something that represents a security interest in their property.
[03:11:49.975 --> 03:12:02.246]  Now, the scary part about it is if you recognize that a national mortgage registry managed by a non-profit group, non-profits can be manipulated and their administrative fees altered, they can literally do anything they want.
[03:12:02.466 --> 03:12:14.117]  But if you've got a complete database that the federal government has access to of every single mortgage in deed of trust, every single security instrument in America, they know where the property is, they know who owns it at any given moment, at least they think they do.
[03:12:14.657 --> 03:12:27.342]  Because the bigger problem with the mortgage electronic registration systems is because of the fact that they jump from the land records into their own database, they've skipped all the intervening assignees out there, all these owners that bought and sold these derivatives on Wall Street.
[03:12:27.702 --> 03:12:33.224]  And so, you know, how is the federal government going to keep up with something like that that's been occurring for 13 years running?
[03:12:33.324 --> 03:12:36.705]  So basically the mismanagement that brings down third world countries is now here.
[03:12:37.325 --> 03:12:38.606]  It looks pretty doggone close.
[03:12:39.526 --> 03:12:44.509]  So is that why they're buying billions of rounds of ammo and setting up secret military bases?
[03:12:44.909 --> 03:12:46.390]  It's hard to say why they're doing that.
[03:12:46.750 --> 03:12:50.713]  You know, I mean, we're hearing that either Homeland Security's got it, TSA's got it.
[03:12:51.013 --> 03:13:03.040]  We have absolutely no idea what they're going to do with this stuff, whether they're going to take it out and use it on target practice, you know, to perfect their... Well, the TSA just bought enough for each agent to shoot 9,000 plus rounds a day for a year straight.
[03:13:03.401 --> 03:13:05.542]  And why would the TSA need that much ammunition?
[03:13:06.206 --> 03:13:09.757]  Well, they actually admit they're trying to drop a supply for us.
[03:13:11.040 --> 03:13:11.722]  That makes sense.
[03:13:12.779 --> 03:13:13.399]  That makes sense.
[03:13:13.439 --> 03:13:17.140]  I wonder what they've got planned that they actually don't want citizens having guns and ammo.
[03:13:17.420 --> 03:13:18.280]  Plus, you failed.
[03:13:18.520 --> 03:13:19.320]  We knew this before.
[03:13:19.340 --> 03:13:21.141]  We already got plenty of guns and ammo, you idiots.
[03:13:21.581 --> 03:13:23.441]  I mean, one day they're just going to come round us up.
[03:13:23.461 --> 03:13:29.002]  It's going to be like jolly old Stalin again, and you're all just going to be able to rob everything and have your way and kick our teeth in.
[03:13:29.363 --> 03:13:33.343]  Ain't going to be that way, you dirty foreign banks, your little commie buddies.
[03:13:33.763 --> 03:13:34.964]  Not going to be a cakewalk.
[03:13:35.264 --> 03:13:39.305]  And when we finally win the war, you know, you've heard of Nazi hunters?
[03:13:39.325 --> 03:13:40.485]  We're going to have globalist hunters.
[03:13:41.710 --> 03:13:57.153]  As long as Americans still have hope, and we still fight, and we fight the good fight, and remember now, the way the court system is right now, you literally have to be prepared to appeal these things because the district court judges were finding a lot of them have derivatives backing their retirement plans.
[03:13:57.573 --> 03:14:04.715]  These are the very things that were securitized using the MERS system, and so there's a little... But they should know they're never going to get it anyways if they don't fix things now.
[03:14:04.895 --> 03:14:09.738]  This is one of the reasons why we audited the judges in Williamson County, to bring it to their attention.
[03:14:09.778 --> 03:14:12.299]  Look, you need to realize what's going on here.
[03:14:12.559 --> 03:14:13.359]  Your own titles.
[03:14:13.399 --> 03:14:14.320]  Good luck selling this.
[03:14:14.580 --> 03:14:20.583]  What happens if years down the road you sell it to a buyer, and all of a sudden a bank from your past comes back and forecloses on them?
[03:14:20.603 --> 03:14:20.983]  Guess what?
[03:14:21.224 --> 03:14:27.667]  When you sign a warranty deed to a new buyer on your house, and it comes before them, and these people come from the back... You're on the hook.
[03:14:27.947 --> 03:14:32.728]  You're on the hook because it says you warranty to defend the title that you sold to the new buyer.
[03:14:33.068 --> 03:14:36.789]  And if there's anything wrong and they get foreclosed on, they're coming back after you.
[03:14:37.030 --> 03:14:39.550]  We have cases going on in America just like that right now.
[03:14:39.870 --> 03:14:40.991]  In fact, you just won a case.
[03:14:41.471 --> 03:14:44.912]  Well, we have a case right now where the bank actually settled with the homeowner.
[03:14:45.192 --> 03:14:48.633]  The homeowner had to give the house back, but the bank had to give the homeowner money.
[03:14:49.313 --> 03:14:56.135]  And the reason that happened was, is that the mortgage got recorded before the warranty deed, so the borrower was not lawfully possessed of ownership.
[03:14:57.068 --> 03:14:57.889]  In the land records.
[03:14:57.949 --> 03:15:00.330]  The land records represent constructive notice to the world.
[03:15:00.690 --> 03:15:12.358]  We have people right here in Austin, as a matter of fact, that I've done chain of title assessments for, that literally, there's no legal description, there's no legal description in the land records that says what they bought.
[03:15:12.458 --> 03:15:14.960]  We have sellers conveying to buyers zero.
[03:15:15.820 --> 03:15:33.281]  No legal description, no CITUS address, no commonly known as with their street address anywhere in the warranty deed and then we've got Fidelity National Financial coming back in six years later when Wells Fargo is trying to foreclose and they're trying to insert a corrective warranty deed into the land records and I've had title attorneys tell me they can't do that.
[03:15:33.962 --> 03:15:34.583]  But they're trying.
[03:15:34.603 --> 03:15:39.887]  They're going to do everything they can to get away with it, and they're counting on the court system, which I implore the court system.
[03:15:39.907 --> 03:15:43.530]  There are some judges now that are actually coming around and starting to look at this.
[03:15:43.570 --> 03:15:47.173]  If you live in the five boroughs in New York, they're at least going to give you the time of day.
[03:15:47.653 --> 03:15:53.398]  Up there in the five boroughs in the metro, especially in Kings County, with Judge Schack, who I talk about in the book, he's my hero.
[03:15:53.899 --> 03:15:58.983]  He literally has defended homeowners when they didn't even show up in court and told the bank, sorry, you haven't proven it up enough.
[03:15:59.443 --> 03:16:11.158]  But on the other hand, we've got a majority of the judges, especially if you live in states like Colorado, which right now they're looking at two major law firms for price fixing, and the Attorney General's office is actually investigating them.
[03:16:11.458 --> 03:16:14.121]  This is the kind of corruption that, you know, we're trying to root out.
[03:16:14.161 --> 03:16:17.205]  This is the kind of corruption, folks, that if we don't turn this around...
[03:16:18.486 --> 03:16:20.667]  Historically, will bring everything down.
[03:16:21.267 --> 03:16:29.108]  I mean, all you people that want to go along with this and think you're part of the establishment, this is country-ending type garbage, okay?
[03:16:29.468 --> 03:16:31.889]  Because that's what the rope-a-dope scammers do.
[03:16:32.249 --> 03:16:33.629]  Like with Too Big to Fail, all this.
[03:16:33.669 --> 03:16:38.510]  They keep you going, but they never even try to fix it during the Too Big to Fail agreement.
[03:16:38.750 --> 03:16:40.511]  They just start scamming even faster.
[03:16:40.771 --> 03:16:43.872]  Like, you know, derivatives are up from what they were just five years ago.
[03:16:44.312 --> 03:16:45.852]  They've only intensified all this.
[03:16:46.032 --> 03:16:48.874]  That's correct, but you know, I want to allude to something you said earlier, Alex.
[03:16:49.094 --> 03:16:50.294]  You were talking about renters.
[03:16:50.554 --> 03:16:52.435]  Renters sit by and say, well, that doesn't affect us.
[03:16:52.696 --> 03:16:55.237]  Well, excuse me, but they securitize commercial paper, too.
[03:16:55.917 --> 03:17:09.345]  The commercial paper has been securitized on Wall Street, and literally the same thing could happen to your apartment complex, and the bank could come in and kick everyone out and put everyone on the street because all the money that you paid the landlord went in the landlord's pocket.
[03:17:09.405 --> 03:17:11.426]  It did not go to the mortgage payment.
[03:17:11.866 --> 03:17:21.928]  And all they have to do is get in a jam where they have a medical emergency or something where they need that money and they take that money and they don't pay the mortgage payment and that whole apartment complex is going to get vacated.
[03:17:22.008 --> 03:17:29.410]  But I can't believe how the public always thinks about themselves like, well I don't, I don't have stock in coal plants and so what if they shut them down?
[03:17:29.430 --> 03:17:30.470]  You're getting the power from it.
[03:17:30.971 --> 03:17:34.351]  When they shut things down and get rid of due process it affects everything.
[03:17:34.671 --> 03:17:36.312]  I mean if this continues
[03:17:36.952 --> 03:17:39.274]  And they continue taking houses that aren't theirs and doing this.
[03:17:39.694 --> 03:17:41.035]  I mean, what's it going to do to the economy?
[03:17:41.235 --> 03:17:41.555]  Oh, I know.
[03:17:41.575 --> 03:17:48.520]  And in Florida, they just passed HB 87, which basically was, you know, something concocted by a realtor who's a state rep.
[03:17:48.960 --> 03:17:56.985]  And what they basically are alluding to here is all the foreclosure defense attorneys are rallying in the state saying, hey, this is denial of due process.
[03:17:57.306 --> 03:18:06.592]  You are going to allow a non-judge, an unelected state judge, an attorney who is a non-judge to get on the stand and sit there and help clear the docket?
[03:18:07.212 --> 03:18:12.996]  In the next three years, Florida is going to have one million, over a million foreclosures backlogged into the system, which is $300,000.
[03:18:13.196 --> 03:18:15.317]  So they're creating a kangaroo court?
[03:18:15.777 --> 03:18:16.137]  Literally.
[03:18:16.157 --> 03:18:19.860]  They're creating a court that basically says, well, I think, you know, the bank owns it.
[03:18:19.900 --> 03:18:23.342]  We got judges that say, well, if the bank didn't own it, they wouldn't have filed a foreclosure suit.
[03:18:23.362 --> 03:18:24.502]  So we're giving it to the bank.
[03:18:24.562 --> 03:18:25.163]  Thank you very much.
[03:18:26.567 --> 03:18:27.908]  That is so crazy.
[03:18:27.928 --> 03:18:28.809]  Why would the bank lie?
[03:18:28.869 --> 03:18:32.872]  Well, you know, read Glaske versus Bank of America, folks.
[03:18:33.172 --> 03:18:33.672]  Dial it up.
[03:18:33.733 --> 03:18:34.793]  G-L-A-S-K-I.
[03:18:35.194 --> 03:18:37.535]  This is what we've been saying in clouded titles.
[03:18:38.056 --> 03:18:44.401]  Came out in Glaske versus Bank of America where all of these derivatives that were securitized on Wall Street in these trusts
[03:18:44.941 --> 03:18:57.091]  Well, the trust came after, you know, Bank of America's representing the trust, and the judge ruled, you know, against the homeowner, went to appellate court, which is why I said you have to be prepared to appeal your case.
[03:18:57.691 --> 03:19:08.360]  You know, you can't just sit there idly by and think just because you got beat in the state courts or in the federal court doesn't mean that you're not going to win an appeal, because this is how Glaske actually occurred in the state court.
[03:19:08.800 --> 03:19:17.985]  What actually ends up happening with Glaske is they're saying that the trust, the way the note was conveyed into the trust pool, who claims to own your loan, it never made it there.
[03:19:18.425 --> 03:19:23.748]  Because the assignment, finally filed in the land records, is six years too late.
[03:19:24.228 --> 03:19:28.711]  Each one of these trusts has what we call a pooling and servicing agreement, and it has to cut off on a closing date.
[03:19:29.111 --> 03:19:34.114]  And if the note's not conveyed into the pool by the closing date, which was generally 90 days after you signed the papers,
[03:19:35.822 --> 03:19:36.922]  It never made the trust pool.
[03:19:37.162 --> 03:19:37.743]  End of story.
[03:19:37.843 --> 03:19:38.923]  It's a void transaction.
[03:19:39.243 --> 03:19:39.903]  Unbelievable.
[03:19:40.263 --> 03:19:41.664]  Yeah, and this is even what you're talking about.
[03:19:41.684 --> 03:19:42.984]  It's even in the mainstream news now.
[03:19:43.404 --> 03:19:44.704]  But it's kind of like, oh, big deal.
[03:19:44.744 --> 03:19:45.705]  We'll figure it all out.
[03:19:46.125 --> 03:19:47.125]  Figure it all out?
[03:19:47.685 --> 03:19:53.447]  I'm seeing it in the news all the time and getting calls where people have paid four houses still, and they're coming and saying, get out.
[03:19:53.987 --> 03:19:56.208]  And the courts, if you don't know what you're doing, will take your house, folks.
[03:19:56.228 --> 03:19:57.528]  That's why you've got to read clouded titles.
[03:19:57.908 --> 03:19:59.268]  Available at infowarestore.com.
[03:19:59.288 --> 03:20:00.109]  Your calls are coming up.

[03:20:07.051 --> 03:20:11.452]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[03:20:11.612 --> 03:20:17.574]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[03:20:17.694 --> 03:20:28.478]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.
[03:20:28.698 --> 03:20:31.361]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gates!

[03:20:35.185 --> 03:20:49.920]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands,
[03:20:50.520 --> 03:20:53.881]  Time and time again.
[03:20:53.981 --> 03:21:00.603]  You need to come here and help us.
[03:21:02.683 --> 03:21:05.664]  We need assistance.
[03:21:06.244 --> 03:21:08.905]  Please!
[03:21:09.185 --> 03:21:12.505]  Those we should be able to depend on let us down.
[03:21:12.765 --> 03:21:18.867]  Federal and state and local officials saying help is on the way, while the folks here in Bell Harbor say show me.
[03:21:19.167 --> 03:21:21.508]  Don't depend on the government to save you.

[03:22:01.328 --> 03:22:04.150]  Friends, this is Alex Jones for MidasResources.com.

[03:22:18.340 --> 03:22:24.184]  This Federal Reserve fiat currency could go the way of the Deutsche Mark and the Weimar Republic any time.
[03:22:24.684 --> 03:22:29.207]  In these historically dangerous times, it makes sense to physically hold gold and silver.
[03:22:29.547 --> 03:22:32.189]  Midas already has some of the best deals in the industry.
[03:22:32.429 --> 03:22:37.532]  But if you give them a call and mention the radio special, they will give you a list of the day's super specials.

[03:23:13.025 --> 03:23:18.289]  But did you know the Berkeys have had independent lab tests done to prove just how effective they are?
[03:23:18.629 --> 03:23:19.109]  It's true!
[03:23:19.349 --> 03:23:21.171]  And he can email you the test results.
[03:23:21.491 --> 03:23:23.392]  Just visit GoBerky.com.

[03:23:48.665 --> 03:23:49.865]  GoBerkey.com, home of the Berkey Guy.
[03:24:16.498 --> 03:24:20.081]  We're continuing through the hour with live overdrive here.
[03:24:20.141 --> 03:24:21.422]  Some stations carry it, a lot don't.
[03:24:21.863 --> 03:24:25.126]  Everybody can find the free video feeds at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[03:24:25.706 --> 03:24:28.649]  And the subscribers, of course, can see the nightly news seven o'clock every night.
[03:24:28.689 --> 03:24:30.790]  I want to thank all the listeners for their support.
[03:24:30.830 --> 03:24:32.011]  We're just looking for justice here.
[03:24:32.352 --> 03:24:37.036]  He's got more news he hadn't gotten to on the latest stuff going on with Bank of America and others.
[03:24:37.496 --> 03:24:39.998]  But right now, we're going to go to your phone calls.
[03:24:40.038 --> 03:24:43.781]  Let me just ask you briefly, who is the worst of all these big six megabanks?
[03:24:44.742 --> 03:24:51.846]  We see more of Wells Fargo, they hold more mortgages in America than any other lender, followed by Bank of America than Chase.
[03:24:52.486 --> 03:25:02.471]  There's a huge issue with Whamu and Chase because we're finding out now from depositions from Lawrence Nardi that Chase never actually got the loans.
[03:25:03.464 --> 03:25:13.593]  And the FDIC was controlling this whole thing, so, you know, we're still trying to drill down into that, and every time we try to get close, they move for protective orders, which means they're trying to cut off our discovery.
[03:25:14.233 --> 03:25:19.338]  Obviously, it's a procedural move, and we still need to keep that... I mean, this is the whole government and the big banksters.
[03:25:19.358 --> 03:25:20.459]  This is a premeditated deal.
[03:25:21.164 --> 03:25:34.374]  You know, it's hard to say it's premeditated, but when you look at the cause and effect, somebody's being influenced here because I can go to judicialwatch.org forward slash judge and hopefully I'm going to find, when I do a background on a federal judge, I'm going to find his financials.
[03:25:34.755 --> 03:25:41.460]  Sam Sparks here in Austin has 15 Ginnie Mae securitized portfolios in his financial statement.
[03:25:41.780 --> 03:25:45.003]  That's recorded on judicialwatch.org forward slash judge.
[03:25:46.264 --> 03:25:50.027]  And he was appointed by legislative act from George H.W.
[03:25:51.544 --> 03:25:52.305]  It's unbelievable.
[03:25:52.365 --> 03:25:54.227]  And he doesn't want MERS cases in his court.
[03:25:54.267 --> 03:25:55.869]  He bullies these attorneys out of here.
[03:25:55.889 --> 03:25:57.250]  I mean, this is what he does.
[03:25:57.310 --> 03:26:01.715]  Every attorney I've talked to complains that he yells at them and says, get that MERS case out of my face.
[03:26:03.818 --> 03:26:04.378]  Unbelievable.
[03:26:04.418 --> 03:26:05.620]  Just let them do whatever they want.
[03:26:06.100 --> 03:26:07.902]  Lisa in New Hampshire, you're on the air.
[03:26:07.942 --> 03:26:08.343]  Go ahead.
[03:26:09.192 --> 03:26:11.593]  Hello, thank you for taking my call.
[03:26:12.114 --> 03:26:14.515]  I have a similar issue that you're discussing today.
[03:26:14.715 --> 03:26:17.176]  Bank of America had a system error.
[03:26:17.776 --> 03:26:22.259]  They threw my house into full closure in their system and they started sending my payments back.
[03:26:22.579 --> 03:26:24.860]  Yeah, yeah, they call that a systems error.
[03:26:25.340 --> 03:26:28.202]  Yeah, and then it took a month to fix.
[03:26:28.982 --> 03:26:34.048]  And then, um, the system showed there was no payments there, so it threw my home back into foreclosure.
[03:26:34.409 --> 03:26:42.278]  Yeah, no, they want to be able to show, from my research, that repeatedly you were in foreclosure and they made a deal with you, but you didn't keep it, Judge.
[03:26:42.899 --> 03:26:44.621]  She's been back and forth three times.
[03:26:45.061 --> 03:26:46.783]  We move you, hand it over immediately.
[03:26:47.884 --> 03:26:49.025]  Am I correct if that's what's done?
[03:26:49.065 --> 03:26:51.986]  Some of the times I've seen that where, oh, we give you a chance now.
[03:26:52.366 --> 03:26:53.147]  It's worse than that.
[03:26:53.367 --> 03:27:05.172]  We have a case in Massachusetts right now where all these Bank of America contract workers and employees, whistleblowers, have come forward with sworn statements saying that we were told to not
[03:27:06.673 --> 03:27:07.454]  Two loan mods.
[03:27:07.735 --> 03:27:08.095]  At all.
[03:27:08.276 --> 03:27:12.042]  We were told the more loan mods you can deny, the better.
[03:27:12.522 --> 03:27:20.455]  In fact, the more loan mods you deny and get into foreclosure, the better chance you have to win a Target or Bed Bath & Beyond gift card.
[03:27:20.535 --> 03:27:21.577]  Yeah!
[03:27:21.897 --> 03:27:22.617]  Gotta love that, right?
[03:27:22.637 --> 03:27:25.218]  Ruining old ladies lives for 50 bucks, baby!
[03:27:25.518 --> 03:27:28.778]  Judas did it for 30 pieces of silver, you do it for nothing.
[03:27:29.079 --> 03:27:29.659]  It's out there.
[03:27:29.899 --> 03:27:35.500]  They literally are saying we were told to just go ahead and continue to do what they call dual track.
[03:27:35.980 --> 03:27:41.741]  In California, they've now passed SB 900, which prohibits dual tracking if they grant a loan mod.
[03:27:41.781 --> 03:27:42.561]  Well, what do you think?
[03:27:42.701 --> 03:27:44.522]  I mean, I'm not a big fan of loan mods.
[03:27:45.302 --> 03:27:48.283]  Because of the fact I know that dual tracking is going on at the same time.
[03:27:48.663 --> 03:27:57.526]  Dual track basically means they're taking money from you, even if it's reduced payments, and then they turn around and they're foreclosing on you and moving to foreclose at the same time they're taking your money.
[03:27:58.066 --> 03:28:02.287]  SB 900 says they can't do that anymore, so that's a bit of a reprieve for California homeowners.
[03:28:02.787 --> 03:28:03.347]  Unbelievable.
[03:28:04.068 --> 03:28:05.668]  Let's talk to Larry in Michigan.
[03:28:05.688 --> 03:28:06.769]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[03:28:06.789 --> 03:28:10.530]  Yeah, this is really interesting.
[03:28:10.930 --> 03:28:11.330]  You know,
[03:28:12.299 --> 03:28:16.983]  It used to be you'd get a deed and then you'd get like title insurance.
[03:28:17.083 --> 03:28:18.584]  Now it's just mirror stuff.
[03:28:19.004 --> 03:28:22.447]  What is the best vehicle or whatever you want?
[03:28:22.487 --> 03:28:23.387]  That's a good question.
[03:28:23.447 --> 03:28:24.869]  How do I buy a house?
[03:28:25.429 --> 03:28:26.210]  How do I do that?
[03:28:26.510 --> 03:28:30.913]  It's amazing about title companies because the title companies, guess what, are the next target.
[03:28:31.654 --> 03:28:35.536]  What's happening here is the title companies, because a lot of them are MERS members,
[03:28:36.297 --> 03:28:37.758]  You know, members of MERS Corp.
[03:28:37.798 --> 03:28:39.900]  We should, you know, there's a new language out now.
[03:28:40.520 --> 03:28:42.141]  MERS is just a shell game.
[03:28:42.662 --> 03:28:43.282]  MERS Corp.
[03:28:43.402 --> 03:28:46.785]  is the real entity and this is who everyone is suing now is MERS Corp.
[03:28:47.085 --> 03:28:52.929]  This is who Williamson County is getting ready to jump into the game down in Nueces County and file suit against MERS Corp.
[03:28:52.949 --> 03:28:54.030]  I want you to talk to my riders.
[03:28:54.050 --> 03:28:57.472]  They should do a report that Williamson County set to sue MERS Corp.
[03:28:58.573 --> 03:28:59.494]  Yeah, they are doing that.
[03:28:59.654 --> 03:29:10.446]  And, you know, the bigger picture, when you look at what the title companies are doing, if you look at, sir, your Schedule B on your owner's title policy, there's more than one kind of title policy.
[03:29:10.466 --> 03:29:14.190]  When you go to closing, you're actually paying for a lender's title policy.
[03:29:14.590 --> 03:29:17.213]  You're insuring the lender against all the misdeeds.
[03:29:17.253 --> 03:29:19.876]  Well, the lender already, if you ever notice these lawsuits,
[03:29:20.396 --> 03:29:24.679]  The lender claiming to own the property is listed MERS as a defendant.
[03:29:24.799 --> 03:29:25.360]  Why is that?
[03:29:25.640 --> 03:29:34.066]  Because they're coming after and it appears they're suing all the unknown assignees in the MERS system to keep them from coming back later on after they take the house.
[03:29:35.367 --> 03:29:38.370]  So like a king rat, it's in there running the others off as well.
[03:29:38.850 --> 03:29:41.152]  Like a hyena over the baby gazelle it's eating.
[03:29:41.832 --> 03:29:42.833]  I tell you what sir, stay there.
[03:29:42.853 --> 03:29:44.714]  I want you to have a comeback to that Larry in Michigan.
[03:29:44.734 --> 03:29:45.275]  I'll be right back.
[03:29:50.563 --> 03:29:53.547]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:54.488 --> 03:29:57.152]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.678 --> 03:30:02.839]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[03:30:03.099 --> 03:30:13.546]  Myself, my family, the Infowars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[03:30:13.766 --> 03:30:17.889]  Infowars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.
[03:30:18.229 --> 03:30:20.711]  But we can't do that without your help.
[03:30:20.971 --> 03:30:31.578]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at Infowars.com, you will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[03:30:32.218 --> 03:30:35.501]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[03:30:35.721 --> 03:30:41.345]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[03:30:41.866 --> 03:30:51.353]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[03:30:51.753 --> 03:30:52.934]  The war is here.
[03:30:53.254 --> 03:30:54.695]  It's an info war.
[03:30:55.155 --> 03:30:56.897]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[03:31:02.054 --> 03:31:04.135]  It's hurricane and wildfire season again.
[03:31:04.155 --> 03:31:11.758]  Why do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year, betting their lives that the disaster won't get them?
[03:31:12.178 --> 03:31:16.840]  Hundreds of you helped eFoodsDirect ship 50,000 donated meals to the Oklahoma victims.
[03:31:17.100 --> 03:31:19.021]  The problem is we can't help everybody.
[03:31:19.281 --> 03:31:25.404]  If every one of us who can will take care of ourselves, we can all pitch in to take care of those who really can't.
[03:31:25.684 --> 03:31:33.508]  The new Just-In-Case Pack from eFoods Direct is the big brother to the 7-Day Emergency Pack designed for Oklahoma disaster donations.
[03:31:33.908 --> 03:31:40.231]  It contains a 2-month supply for 1 person, or a 1-month supply for 2 adults, or a 2-week supply for a family of 4.
[03:31:40.291 --> 03:31:41.311]  The $320 price is $50 less than retail.
[03:31:44.833 --> 03:31:45.894]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[03:31:45.914 --> 03:31:47.654]  Order two or more, get 10% off, free shipping applies.
[03:31:47.674 --> 03:31:50.696]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[03:32:01.015 --> 03:32:03.218]  What's safer and cheaper than prescription drugs?
[03:32:03.698 --> 03:32:04.479]  Glad you asked.
[03:32:04.940 --> 03:32:07.002]  The answer is renovation teas.
[03:32:07.302 --> 03:32:11.227]  Herbal remedies are much safer and much cheaper than prescription drugs.
[03:32:11.507 --> 03:32:15.572]  Tastes great and most importantly herbal teas are effective and non-addictive.
[03:32:15.792 --> 03:32:18.656]  Renovation tea is especially unique and here's why.
[03:32:19.016 --> 03:32:22.297]  We spent years researching herbs and their beneficial properties.
[03:32:22.798 --> 03:32:27.119]  Renovation Teas uses only 100% organic, fair trade herbs.
[03:32:27.459 --> 03:32:36.043]  Our teas are blended towards specific ailments and health conditions, such as diabetes, blood pressure, anxiety, libido, detox, and much more.
[03:32:36.483 --> 03:32:40.145]  All Renovation Tees are formulated and hand-filled in Arkansas.
[03:32:40.365 --> 03:32:43.567]  Take care of yourself naturally, the way Mother Nature intended.
[03:32:43.907 --> 03:32:48.289]  Order Renovation Tees at RenovationTee.com or call 870-784-3121.
[03:32:48.349 --> 03:32:48.649]  That's 870-784-3121.
[03:32:48.669 --> 03:32:49.570]  Renovation Tees.
[03:32:49.590 --> 03:32:51.351]  Renovate your health, one bag at a time.
[03:33:14.620 --> 03:33:16.221]  Every move the globalists make.
[03:33:18.842 --> 03:33:21.022]  Every criminal action they engage in.
[03:33:23.003 --> 03:33:24.003]  We'll be watching you.
[03:33:25.224 --> 03:33:29.605]  By the way, this song is about 1984.
[03:33:29.745 --> 03:33:31.586]  A lot of people think it's a love song.
[03:33:31.646 --> 03:33:32.066]  It's not.
[03:33:35.327 --> 03:33:36.668]  In every word you say.
[03:33:39.008 --> 03:33:47.553]  The system wants to surveil us like we've done something wrong, while it has been caught engaging in every form of crime, abuse of the public you can imagine.
[03:33:47.593 --> 03:33:49.835]  And it just goes on and on.
[03:33:49.975 --> 03:33:58.200]  And then the tyranny, the black uniforms, the helicopters, the surveillance, is about protecting the corrupt ruling class that's taken over.
[03:33:58.560 --> 03:34:00.721]  And it's not like their corruption is making us wealthy.
[03:34:01.342 --> 03:34:06.725]  The British Empire, if you actually served it aggressively, you could actually get wealthy off of it in a lot of cases.
[03:34:08.010 --> 03:34:09.591]  And I would still say that was immoral.
[03:34:10.112 --> 03:34:12.813]  But this is an empire we pay for and then go bankrupt.
[03:34:13.814 --> 03:34:16.576]  And then they're all offshore on private jets going, ah-ha!
[03:34:17.317 --> 03:34:17.457]  Ah-ha!
[03:34:17.877 --> 03:34:19.938]  It's so hilarious to the New World Order.
[03:34:19.958 --> 03:34:21.600]  David Krieger is our guest.
[03:34:21.840 --> 03:34:24.782]  And what an exciting document you have here.
[03:34:24.822 --> 03:34:30.266]  I want to get through the next four or five calls and then have you make some final comments here and tell us about some of the other big news out there.
[03:34:30.306 --> 03:34:33.408]  But I wish this just wasn't true, because it's creepy.
[03:34:33.988 --> 03:34:51.896]  Knowing this much institutional corruption goes on, but hey, if we let the private Federal Reserve since 1913 issue tens of trillions of their own fiat currency and get interest off of it, why aren't they going to start more elaborate forms of usury and counterfeiting?
[03:34:52.196 --> 03:34:54.298]  I mean, where's the Secret Service when you need them?
[03:34:54.519 --> 03:34:56.421]  Because I'm no lawyer, but I do a lot of studying.
[03:34:56.741 --> 03:35:01.507]  This sounds like something the Secret Service would get involved in, because this debases the whole currency in the whole country.
[03:35:01.787 --> 03:35:07.693]  Well, and then when you try to introduce competing currencies like Bitcoin and other things like that, they shut it off.
[03:35:08.578 --> 03:35:11.340]  You know, and this is something that's been ongoing.
[03:35:12.741 --> 03:35:16.284]  You know, we have people trying to insert their own brand of justice.
[03:35:16.584 --> 03:35:24.310]  This is a real problem because the system, and I teach these in my workshops, the system actually has tools to fight the system.
[03:35:24.771 --> 03:35:26.892]  You use the system's own tools against it.
[03:35:27.393 --> 03:35:34.638]  We have so many people out there trying to put what I describe as a giant square peg into a very small round hole, which is our justice system.
[03:35:35.319 --> 03:35:37.261]  And the problem is it doesn't fit.
[03:35:37.981 --> 03:35:40.304]  And so, you know, and they wonder why they're getting beat up.
[03:35:40.724 --> 03:35:44.369]  And the one thing that, you know, I have to clarify this and disagree with me if you want.
[03:35:44.629 --> 03:35:45.831]  That's what the phone line is for.
[03:35:46.391 --> 03:35:53.380]  But the thing is, is when you move and this I teach this in the seminar, when you are in this constitutional mindset.
[03:35:53.860 --> 03:35:56.982]  You know, 110.1 says, obligation of a contract shall not be impaired.
[03:35:57.002 --> 03:35:57.542]  Well, guess what?
[03:35:58.023 --> 03:35:59.804]  They have mortgages, they have deeds of trust.
[03:36:00.024 --> 03:36:00.864]  Those are contracts.
[03:36:01.305 --> 03:36:13.372]  When you sign the contracts at closing, if you want to help the system out, and you go into closing, and you see your deed of trust or mortgage, and it has an 18-digit number underneath it that says MERS, Mortgage Identification.
[03:36:13.392 --> 03:36:14.613]  Don't be a party to the fraud!
[03:36:14.733 --> 03:36:15.513]  Walk away from it!
[03:36:15.833 --> 03:36:17.174]  Stop getting MERS mortgages!
[03:36:17.234 --> 03:36:18.355]  That's what they want you to do.
[03:36:18.395 --> 03:36:21.377]  These refis, especially, are loaded with MERS.
[03:36:21.717 --> 03:36:23.338]  HELOCs, loaded with MERS.
[03:36:23.698 --> 03:36:25.579]  And by the way, the only saving... Well, that's a good point.
[03:36:25.639 --> 03:36:30.341]  If the American people know all this now and go along with it, they become a party to the fraud.
[03:36:30.601 --> 03:36:31.061]  Exactly.
[03:36:31.081 --> 03:36:39.405]  Yeah, the house I just bought, I told the bank, I said, no, MERS, you don't sell it, you don't securitize it, you don't do anything with it, you hold it... And that brings us back to the last guy.
[03:36:39.605 --> 03:36:44.668]  A lot of people I know that have been getting houses since all this came out the last, really, four or five years, but in the decade before,
[03:36:45.368 --> 03:36:46.629]  You can work with title companies.
[03:36:46.670 --> 03:36:47.610]  You can go get it clean.
[03:36:48.011 --> 03:36:49.352]  You can demand all that, can't you?
[03:36:49.472 --> 03:36:51.895]  Well, no, actually, the title company can't clean your file.
[03:36:51.955 --> 03:36:55.698]  You have to go to court and do what's known as a... But I mean, I'm not talking about after the fact.
[03:36:55.999 --> 03:36:59.382]  People are able, if you do it right, to go get a clean sale or cleaner, right?
[03:36:59.783 --> 03:37:08.872]  Well, a lot of that depends on what the title company is willing to insure, because once it gets into the MERS system, understand that you have somebody who owns the property, and then they're going to convey it to you.
[03:37:09.412 --> 03:37:12.554]  But listen, you don't agree that they're allowed to sell it over and over again.
[03:37:12.614 --> 03:37:22.301]  No, I think that there's a real problem because of the fact that, you know, the note itself has been sold multiple times and you have all of these people... Oh, so it's bad because you're buying a note that's already bad.
[03:37:22.941 --> 03:37:29.505]  Well, no, you're actually buying a property that may have been corrupted by multiple owners who recorded their interests.
[03:37:29.686 --> 03:37:29.906]  Yeah.
[03:37:30.506 --> 03:37:31.407]  That's the problem.
[03:37:31.967 --> 03:37:37.531]  And you don't know whether those interests, like you said earlier, are going to come back down the road and bite you in the... So wait, I mean, what do you do?
[03:37:37.551 --> 03:37:37.651]  Buy a...
[03:37:39.592 --> 03:37:41.793]  I mean, even if it's raw land, it's going to have some history.
[03:37:42.153 --> 03:37:44.614]  Well, not as much as, you know, with a house.
[03:37:44.634 --> 03:37:46.394]  So you buy raw land and build on it.
[03:37:46.474 --> 03:37:47.415]  That's my best bet.
[03:37:47.435 --> 03:37:50.556]  And then don't go to the bank and don't get a loan unless you happen to be one of the bankers.
[03:37:50.576 --> 03:37:52.036]  That sounds like the way the old-timers did it.
[03:37:52.076 --> 03:37:52.597]  Well, you know what?
[03:37:52.657 --> 03:37:55.197]  That's exactly what... There's a new video out.
[03:37:55.598 --> 03:37:59.319]  It's not new, but it was by John Campbell, and he explained the way the old system works.
[03:37:59.699 --> 03:38:00.460]  You went to the bank.
[03:38:00.700 --> 03:38:01.801]  You knew who the banker was.
[03:38:02.041 --> 03:38:03.062]  The bank knew who you were.
[03:38:03.082 --> 03:38:04.223]  He knew where you worked.
[03:38:04.303 --> 03:38:05.224]  Everything was local.
[03:38:05.525 --> 03:38:08.487]  You didn't have to worry about him taking it and securitizing it on Wall Street.
[03:38:08.788 --> 03:38:11.490]  You knew that he was going to record his interest in the land records.
[03:38:11.750 --> 03:38:14.053]  And when you went down there, you knew who owned your loan.
[03:38:14.553 --> 03:38:15.794]  You knew who had a security interest.
[03:38:15.814 --> 03:38:17.256]  And by the way, that's how towns work.
[03:38:17.376 --> 03:38:18.497]  Everybody knew your granddaddy.
[03:38:18.517 --> 03:38:19.418]  They knew you were a farmer.
[03:38:19.678 --> 03:38:21.660]  They knew you were going to build this house and pay on it.
[03:38:22.040 --> 03:38:23.421]  And that was the end of it.
[03:38:23.462 --> 03:38:24.843]  You got the loan because they knew who you were.
[03:38:25.123 --> 03:38:25.523]  Exactly.
[03:38:25.583 --> 03:38:27.525]  And they wanted you to make the payments.
[03:38:27.625 --> 03:38:29.426]  Banks really don't want to own your house.
[03:38:29.887 --> 03:38:38.313]  You know, but the way the system is now, the banks said, look, we can make so much money taking all this stuff and structuring these adjustable rate mortgages.
[03:38:38.573 --> 03:38:45.358]  They're going to reset themselves years down the road that we already know the homeowner has a breaking point because we know he makes this much.
[03:38:45.758 --> 03:38:48.900]  But if we can get him to get into a house this much when it doubles.
[03:38:49.921 --> 03:38:53.925]  And that's what Clinton did on record, going, we're going to give poor people loans.
[03:38:54.205 --> 03:38:55.386]  It was a giant swindle.
[03:38:55.726 --> 03:38:57.588]  Well, they were called liar loans or ninja loans.
[03:38:57.628 --> 03:39:00.291]  But it's OK, because he's the first black president.
[03:39:00.951 --> 03:39:04.334]  And if you're against ripping off black people and minorities, you're a racist.
[03:39:04.534 --> 03:39:05.535]  Well, sorry about that.
[03:39:05.575 --> 03:39:06.456]  But, you know, it happened.
[03:39:06.476 --> 03:39:08.658]  It cut across the complete... No, I know, I know.
[03:39:08.678 --> 03:39:09.399]  But that's what they said.
[03:39:09.419 --> 03:39:10.400]  They go, hey, don't talk about...
[03:39:10.740 --> 03:39:12.160]  It's racist to talk bad about Obama.
[03:39:12.180 --> 03:39:12.981]  It affects everybody.
[03:39:13.081 --> 03:39:13.601]  Or Clinton.
[03:39:13.741 --> 03:39:15.741]  You know, Frank in Michigan, or is it Larry?
[03:39:15.781 --> 03:39:16.542]  Is it Larry in Michigan?
[03:39:16.562 --> 03:39:19.842]  Yeah, he just hung up and I was going to go back to him, but what does he do then?
[03:39:19.882 --> 03:39:20.683]  How does he get a house?
[03:39:20.763 --> 03:39:27.865]  Well, the thing is, is that, you know, when I looked for my house, I basically went through and I used the MERS system and I looked up all the addresses to see if MERS was involved.
[03:39:27.905 --> 03:39:28.945]  If it was, I moved on.
[03:39:29.665 --> 03:39:33.828]  Unfortunately, MERS is affecting over 70 million pieces of property in America.
[03:39:34.108 --> 03:39:35.629]  That's 60% of all... So that's it?
[03:39:35.649 --> 03:39:37.470]  You don't go with a MERS piece of property?
[03:39:37.530 --> 03:39:38.971]  Yeah, you really try to find something?
[03:39:39.031 --> 03:39:45.356]  I mean, I really encourage, like I did the last time, before I bought a house, I actually bought three-quarter acre, put a house on it.
[03:39:45.376 --> 03:39:46.436]  Take cash.
[03:39:46.937 --> 03:39:47.177]  Done.
[03:39:48.510 --> 03:39:50.052]  No, no, it was clean title.
[03:39:50.072 --> 03:40:00.866]  If somebody was going to foreclose on me, there would have to be some sort of history there, unless somebody, like what happened in Williamson County, that poor fella who had two houses and sold one, and they used the wrong legal description.
[03:40:01.046 --> 03:40:01.987]  That's on the trustee.
[03:40:02.247 --> 03:40:05.131]  They have errors and omissions insurance, so do the title companies.
[03:40:05.391 --> 03:40:07.013]  Guess who writes underwrites most of the E&O?
[03:40:07.694 --> 03:40:09.155]  GE Capital Corporation.
[03:40:09.255 --> 03:40:12.197]  So we have megacorporations insuring megacorporations.
[03:40:12.657 --> 03:40:25.246]  And so in order to get around this, when you go to closing, look at where it says on your title policy, under Schedule B of your owner's policy, we cannot insure property or insure a claim if it's not recorded in the land records.
[03:40:25.466 --> 03:40:30.049]  Well, if it's not in the land records, we don't have to insure it, which means you get to pay the legal fees.
[03:40:30.069 --> 03:40:35.513]  All right, let's go to JT Coyote out in Colorado.
[03:40:35.533 --> 03:40:36.053]  You're on the air.
[03:40:36.093 --> 03:40:36.454]  Go ahead.
[03:40:37.520 --> 03:40:38.980]  Hey guys.
[03:40:39.781 --> 03:40:43.422]  I've been fighting the banks now for about five years.
[03:40:44.722 --> 03:40:55.485]  It seems like every time we get them to back down, then a new mortgage or mortgage company will come in and they start the proceeding over again.
[03:40:55.505 --> 03:41:02.606]  I pulled up a title search on the property from the county clerk.
[03:41:05.726 --> 03:41:10.548]  And it's loaded with murrs clear back to the first, the very first loan we got.
[03:41:11.428 --> 03:41:23.412]  So, uh, we've, we've been holding them off, uh, by asking them basically to hold, uh, show us some, show us a note, show us that you own it and then we'll pay you.
[03:41:23.432 --> 03:41:23.512]  Yeah.
[03:41:24.272 --> 03:41:27.093]  Well, that's another angle is use their fraud.
[03:41:27.113 --> 03:41:31.275]  A lot of people do this to stay in the house without paying to get some of your money back.
[03:41:31.315 --> 03:41:31.975]  Is that what you're doing?
[03:41:32.705 --> 03:41:46.385]  Well, that's what we're attempting to do because as the loan matured, you know, as each payment, it would get higher and higher and higher until there was a point where, you know, there was no way we could make enough money.
[03:41:47.381 --> 03:41:49.042]  To pay the monthly payment.
[03:41:49.843 --> 03:41:55.326]  And then one of us lost our job and boom we were in foreclosure.
[03:41:55.446 --> 03:42:00.029]  And I remember you write for InfoWars.com sometimes and you're a well-known pro-gun guy.
[03:42:00.049 --> 03:42:08.095]  You even got SWAT teamed when you were showing the house, was it four or five years ago, that realtors saw the reloading equipment in the basement.
[03:42:09.045 --> 03:42:15.730]  And now the Seattle Mayor is saying, if you see a gun, call the police, even if it's in somebody's house.
[03:42:16.170 --> 03:42:21.754]  Seattle Mayor to launch gun-free zone program for private businesses and other areas as well.
[03:42:22.655 --> 03:42:25.497]  So, I mean, I'm just a side issue, what a police state this country is.
[03:42:25.537 --> 03:42:29.980]  But what's your question specifically for our guest, Dave Krieger?
[03:42:30.860 --> 03:42:37.425]  What I would like for David to address is how one can clear
[03:42:38.300 --> 03:42:39.661]  The MERS from the title.
[03:42:39.961 --> 03:42:47.643]  Is there any way, including litigation, to clearly...
[03:42:57.407 --> 03:42:58.368]  And you see MERS in there.
[03:42:58.408 --> 03:43:05.077]  That means each time you took out a MERS loan, multiple intervening assignees bought and sold your loan on Wall Street over and over and over again.
[03:43:05.417 --> 03:43:14.168]  So when that happened, now you have all these specific chances for unknown people, unknown parties down the road to come back and foreclose even after the fact.
[03:43:14.528 --> 03:43:16.149]  Let's say that you decide to sell your house.
[03:43:16.469 --> 03:43:30.698]  You couldn't sell it with all those mortgages there because, one, if you know you can't convey clear title, and there's even conditions in your title policy that say if you know something to be in error and you don't tell the title company about it, they don't have to cover you.
[03:43:30.778 --> 03:43:35.081]  So it's fraud all the time when most mortgages have this in it and people are selling houses.
[03:43:35.401 --> 03:43:40.326]  Makes you wonder why we even have title policies in the first place if the title companies aren't going to insure.
[03:43:40.646 --> 03:43:45.732]  Now it's turning out to be one of these games where the title company is looking for every reason why not to pay.
[03:43:45.752 --> 03:43:50.396]  But yet you cough up $700 for an owner's policy at closing.
[03:43:50.697 --> 03:43:54.501]  But to answer your question, JT, you're looking at basically quieting title.
[03:43:54.541 --> 03:43:55.462]  There's your litigation.
[03:43:55.942 --> 03:44:00.284]  But the problem with Quiet Title is, you know, even at Convey, here's an argument for you.
[03:44:00.644 --> 03:44:04.065]  If I go into court and I'm standing in front of a judge and I say, Your Honor, look at it this way.
[03:44:04.545 --> 03:44:11.628]  I've got a situation here where I've got MERS all over my mortgage and I think, I believe that there are unknown intervening assignees that might claim an interest.
[03:44:12.188 --> 03:44:16.770]  If I sell this property in order to help the lender mitigate his damage,
[03:44:18.323 --> 03:44:19.664]  I'm fine and I can't do that.
[03:44:19.884 --> 03:44:34.031]  I can't even sell my house because the title's clouded, but yet you're going to give this to the bank, Judge, and they're going to turn around and sell it to some other sucker, investor, or homeowner that's going to come in and literally inherit all your problems when you convey it.
[03:44:34.051 --> 03:44:36.432]  And that's their master plan with Too Big to Fail.
[03:44:36.912 --> 03:44:42.275]  With everything, they get you to invest in the fraud, and now you don't want to end it because everything's connected to it.
[03:44:42.515 --> 03:44:42.715]  Right.
[03:44:42.815 --> 03:44:48.837]  And then they have a crisis where that collapses, and they get more power promising to fix it, and then that collapses.
[03:44:49.617 --> 03:44:50.858]  This is how, this is their plan.
[03:44:50.918 --> 03:44:55.819]  Well, and the problem is, here, the judiciary, the court system we've got in America, hasn't seen anything yet.
[03:44:56.119 --> 03:44:58.060]  It's about to get jammed up and jelly tight.
[03:45:00.200 --> 03:45:05.502]  Well, all I can say is, folks, do what they say and hand over your house to the foreign banks, or you're racist.
[03:45:05.602 --> 03:45:06.903]  I agree with MSNBC.
[03:45:07.503 --> 03:45:08.923]  You're like, what does this have to do with racism?
[03:45:09.143 --> 03:45:11.244]  I don't know, but we're all racist.
[03:45:12.288 --> 03:45:15.813]  Uh, let's talk to, uh, Vincent in Washington.
[03:45:15.853 --> 03:45:16.474]  You're on the air.
[03:45:16.534 --> 03:45:16.995]  Go ahead.
[03:45:18.477 --> 03:45:19.278]  How's it going, Alex?
[03:45:19.458 --> 03:45:19.999]  Good, sir.
[03:45:20.059 --> 03:45:20.760]  Welcome.
[03:45:21.320 --> 03:45:22.342]  First-time caller.
[03:45:22.802 --> 03:45:24.424]  Official one-year listener.
[03:45:25.406 --> 03:45:26.587]  Uh, being proud of you woke me up.
[03:45:26.687 --> 03:45:28.169]  Well, good to have you on board, my friend.
[03:45:28.410 --> 03:45:29.070]  Let's, yeah, go ahead.
[03:45:30.188 --> 03:45:47.246]  My question is, back in the mid late 90s when housing started going crazy and people were getting these zero interest loans and zero job loans and I was scratching my head back then and then we had this big housing bubble.
[03:45:47.546 --> 03:45:55.255]  Now what you're seeing on TV is all these reverse mortgages, and I think they're trying to attack the older people that actually paid off on them.
[03:45:55.715 --> 03:45:59.479]  I want to know what was your guys' thoughts on reverse mortgages.
[03:45:59.580 --> 03:45:59.980]  Thank you.
[03:46:00.020 --> 03:46:00.320]  Sure, sure.
[03:46:00.340 --> 03:46:00.781]  Thank you, sir.
[03:46:00.801 --> 03:46:01.462]  That's a good question.
[03:46:01.502 --> 03:46:04.245]  Dave Krieger here, our clouded titles expert.
[03:46:04.485 --> 03:46:11.610]  You know, it's amazing if you ever study the Harry Dent and the Dent Method, he can gauge over a 36-year period how the economy shapes itself.
[03:46:11.670 --> 03:46:17.634]  Well, this thing kind of threw a monkey wrench, this whole mortgage debacle, threw a monkey wrench in the thing.
[03:46:18.154 --> 03:46:19.555]  So you see all the middle class...
[03:46:19.995 --> 03:46:27.462]  Right now, the baby boomers at average age of 42 buying homes and getting into the situation now with what Vincent's talking about.
[03:46:27.863 --> 03:46:33.628]  And they're getting these loans that are ninja loans, no income, no job, no assets, liar loans where it's stated income.
[03:46:33.869 --> 03:46:34.749]  Just tell us how much you make.
[03:46:34.769 --> 03:46:36.791]  Well, I'll tell you what, you only make $10,000 a year?
[03:46:37.072 --> 03:46:38.293]  Let's add a zero to the back end.
[03:46:38.333 --> 03:46:38.673]  Now you make $100,000.
[03:46:38.713 --> 03:46:39.474]  We can get you a loan.
[03:46:40.535 --> 03:46:45.378]  Countrywide, you know, bank officials rumored to say, hey, if you can fog up a mirror, we'll give you a loan.
[03:46:45.739 --> 03:46:47.460]  So here they're attacking the middle class.
[03:46:47.520 --> 03:46:56.566]  By the time they get to the baby boomer, see, they've got to have another way to take care of the third of the population now that's over 65 that's taxing the health industry.
[03:46:57.086 --> 03:46:59.208]  And so what they've got to do is bring death panels in.
[03:46:59.228 --> 03:46:59.388]  Yeah.
[03:46:59.428 --> 03:47:06.172]  And that's and that's what now we have to have reverse mortgages because now they want to attack the state and take all the equity, whatever equity you have.
[03:47:06.532 --> 03:47:08.474]  And they'll bleed that out using reverse mortgage.
[03:47:08.694 --> 03:47:09.254]  I don't like them.
[03:47:09.434 --> 03:47:10.295]  I wouldn't recommend them.
[03:47:11.295 --> 03:47:16.297]  What about these balloon mortgages, these adjustable rates, and all the rest of it?
[03:47:16.357 --> 03:47:17.858]  Those are insane, Alex.
[03:47:17.958 --> 03:47:19.698]  I don't know why anybody would take one of those.
[03:47:19.818 --> 03:47:28.902]  I have clients calling me, or wannabe clients calling me, and they said, well we found out in 2009 that we've signed an interest-only mortgage.
[03:47:29.042 --> 03:47:33.043]  And I went, wait a minute, you're in Wisconsin, that's a deficiency state, oh my god.
[03:47:33.383 --> 03:47:34.484]  You have that OMG moment?
[03:47:34.564 --> 03:47:37.265]  Well, realize that what they've signed basically is rent,
[03:47:38.493 --> 03:47:39.654]  With a penalty at the end.
[03:47:39.674 --> 03:47:46.741]  A penalty that they will go to court and take everything you own until it's all fully collected once they've sold your house.
[03:47:47.181 --> 03:47:49.043]  Because, I mean, you literally have no equity.
[03:47:49.283 --> 03:47:56.630]  This couple took all their 401k, threw it all into their late payments to bring it up to speed, and still got behind because he was on unemployment.
[03:47:57.210 --> 03:47:59.131]  So this family is making, literally, they got $2,000.
[03:47:59.171 --> 03:48:01.852]  Yeah, I mean, at a certain point... It's a sad story.
[03:48:01.893 --> 03:48:04.714]  No, no, I mean, these globalists all declare bankruptcy and walk away.
[03:48:04.814 --> 03:48:06.995]  And they always say that's immoral to declare bankruptcy.
[03:48:07.315 --> 03:48:12.338]  But when the whole system's rigged against you, I'm not going to give people individual advice, but just walk away.
[03:48:12.398 --> 03:48:13.218]  Declare bankruptcy.
[03:48:13.439 --> 03:48:14.139]  Don't pay any of it.
[03:48:14.159 --> 03:48:15.079]  It's all a fraud anyways.
[03:48:15.099 --> 03:48:21.163]  Well, that's why I put Section 3 Strategic Default in the book, because you've got to know what your options are, and that's where you'll find them, in Section 3 of the book.
[03:48:21.343 --> 03:48:24.784]  Absolutely, because they're just going to skin you up one side and down the other.
[03:48:24.844 --> 03:48:25.425]  I mean, it's like...
[03:48:26.391 --> 03:48:27.672]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[03:48:28.032 --> 03:48:29.833]  Because they just use us like schmucks.
[03:48:30.773 --> 03:48:33.134]  If we sit there and quote, do the right thing, and they're fraud.
[03:48:33.455 --> 03:48:35.135]  I mean, we're hard-working, honest Americans.
[03:48:35.176 --> 03:48:36.276]  We want to do the right thing.
[03:48:37.016 --> 03:48:37.897]  But it doesn't matter.
[03:48:37.937 --> 03:48:39.658]  You can pay them everything you got, and they still cheat you.
[03:48:39.878 --> 03:48:40.338]  Exactly.
[03:48:40.398 --> 03:48:47.382]  And that's the problem, especially when you're dealing in issues like dual track, and you've got the megabanks who played in more of these derivatives than the little guys did.
[03:48:48.002 --> 03:48:50.083]  Man, I sure wish we could just arrest all these bankers.
[03:48:50.563 --> 03:48:53.505]  I wish we could too, but I think we're going to have to change presidents to get that done.
[03:48:54.693 --> 03:48:56.615]  Yeah, what's your take on Obama and all this?
[03:48:56.635 --> 03:49:01.740]  This guy has done relatively little, if anything, to fix this program.
[03:49:01.780 --> 03:49:02.541]  Hampa's a joke.
[03:49:03.604 --> 03:49:04.925]  A total joke in my book.
[03:49:05.045 --> 03:49:06.285]  In fact, I put it in the book.
[03:49:06.625 --> 03:49:07.546]  I don't rely on HAMP.
[03:49:07.986 --> 03:49:08.806]  Very few people rely on HAMP.
[03:49:08.826 --> 03:49:10.487]  It was just a stalling, stalling technique.
[03:49:10.567 --> 03:49:11.527]  Well, I mean, this is it.
[03:49:11.787 --> 03:49:16.229]  When you go to get a loan mod and you think you're eligible for HAMP, I mean, you need to run the numbers first.
[03:49:16.269 --> 03:49:16.709]  So it's worse.
[03:49:16.789 --> 03:49:17.690]  It's more false hope.
[03:49:18.250 --> 03:49:18.970]  That's exactly it.
[03:49:19.110 --> 03:49:20.011]  They want to give you hope.
[03:49:20.031 --> 03:49:21.171]  They want to keep you hanging on.
[03:49:21.491 --> 03:49:26.633]  But what really is bothering me is one of my clients from a week ago said, we got a letter.
[03:49:26.674 --> 03:49:27.734]  And I actually saw the letter.
[03:49:28.054 --> 03:49:32.516]  And the bank actually told him, you haven't been late enough on your payments for us to do a loan mod.
[03:49:34.062 --> 03:49:35.843]  I'm going, gee, how late do you need to be?
[03:49:35.863 --> 03:49:36.123]  90 days?
[03:49:36.143 --> 03:49:37.083]  They want to jack it up.
[03:49:37.163 --> 03:49:38.184]  No, it's 90 days.
[03:49:38.244 --> 03:49:45.927]  What happens if there's default insurance, 90 days elapses, the bank goes to the insurance carrier and says, hey, they're in default, it's been over 90 days, pay up.
[03:49:46.148 --> 03:49:48.929]  The bank has been made whole and they're still coming after your property.
[03:49:50.433 --> 03:49:50.954]  Unbelievable.
[03:49:51.014 --> 03:49:56.541]  And then they go cash in, they've got all these derivatives and... Fraud on fraud on fraud on fraud.
[03:49:56.561 --> 03:49:57.342]  You know what the CDS is?
[03:49:57.863 --> 03:49:58.924]  It's an insurance policy.
[03:49:59.165 --> 03:49:59.906]  It's a side bet.
[03:50:00.206 --> 03:50:00.907]  Guess what happens?
[03:50:01.207 --> 03:50:02.849]  You know, like Detroit, they're in Chapter 9.
[03:50:03.370 --> 03:50:04.311]  Why are they in Chapter 9?
[03:50:04.492 --> 03:50:05.793]  Because they bought these bonds.
[03:50:06.454 --> 03:50:09.816]  A lot of these municipalities, there's at least 20 that were listed just on Yahoo alone.
[03:50:09.836 --> 03:50:10.657]  David, stop right there.
[03:50:10.697 --> 03:50:14.019]  Folks can go to your website and sign up for your different events that you put on.

[03:50:21.863 --> 03:50:22.424]  Everyone!
[03:50:23.104 --> 03:50:24.005]  Should read this.

[03:50:26.787 --> 03:50:28.789]  Not any patriot mythology stuff.
[03:50:29.409 --> 03:50:30.290]  This is the real deal.

[03:50:37.395 --> 03:50:40.018]  I got to a lot of callers, but I'm out of time.
[03:50:40.078 --> 03:50:41.879]  Joe, Rita, Bill, Jason, I apologize.
[03:50:42.219 --> 03:50:44.341]  Love to get you back up soon on the phone to take their phone calls.
[03:50:44.781 --> 03:50:46.323]  We're going to rebroadcast after this break.
[03:50:47.223 --> 03:50:48.023]  I got a lot of work to do.
[03:50:48.044 --> 03:50:49.384]  I'm gonna get exhausted if I keep going.
[03:50:49.584 --> 03:50:51.505]  I'm gonna interview you for Obama Deception 2.
[03:50:52.045 --> 03:50:53.126]  Everybody and their uncle's in it.
[03:50:53.146 --> 03:50:53.966]  You're gonna do a great job.
[03:50:54.386 --> 03:50:56.647]  I got the nightly news coming up tonight, 7 o'clock central.
[03:50:57.027 --> 03:50:59.749]  This is a fight, folks, and bending over is only gonna make it worse.
[03:50:59.869 --> 03:51:00.729]  We gotta stand up.
[03:51:01.469 --> 03:51:03.110]  Introducing Pro1.
[03:51:03.370 --> 03:51:06.892]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on the go.
[03:51:07.012 --> 03:51:11.434]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[03:51:11.594 --> 03:51:13.895]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride
