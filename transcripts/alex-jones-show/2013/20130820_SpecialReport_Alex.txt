[00:00:11.067 --> 00:00:13.249]  All right, sir, how would you rate President Obama's job performance?
[00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:15.491]  Overall, very well.
[00:00:16.232 --> 00:00:17.133]  On a scale of 1 to 10?
[00:00:17.233 --> 00:00:17.433]  Yes.
[00:00:17.534 --> 00:00:17.854]  Right now?
[00:00:19.656 --> 00:00:20.436]  I'd give him a 7.5.
[00:00:21.237 --> 00:00:22.198]  I'll give him a 6.
[00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:24.220]  Any particular area that you're impressed with?
[00:00:26.523 --> 00:00:27.884]  He speaks in complete sentences.
[00:00:27.904 --> 00:00:29.686]  How do you feel about Obamacare?
[00:00:30.777 --> 00:00:39.860]  Well, I think sometimes it doesn't benefit me personally in terms of the changes that are made, but I think it benefits people on the whole.
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.321]  I don't have health insurance.
[00:00:41.561 --> 00:00:59.587]  I don't look forward to paying premiums that I don't pay now, but hopefully the fact that we all have to sign up, those of us uninsured, will make those premiums a lot more affordable and I'm going to join just because I think all the wrong people want me to sit on the sidelines and not join.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:08.802]  Having Obamacare will probably make the healthcare that they do give not as high of standards.
[00:01:08.962 --> 00:01:15.404]  There's some strict premiums and guidelines with Obamacare and we actually see employers actually cutting the hours of their employees so they can't benefit.
[00:01:15.744 --> 00:01:23.266]  Well, at least in some fields where workers are short, let's hope that it becomes one of those carrots.
[00:01:24.045 --> 00:01:27.147]  And what do you ladies think about married couples having increased premiums?
[00:01:27.167 --> 00:01:29.930]  So if you get married, your premiums are going to increase.
[00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.972]  Yeah, I don't understand what his intentions are with that.
[00:01:33.132 --> 00:01:39.157]  We see about 60% of doctors say they'd rather retire early than go through all the hoops of implementing Obamacare.
[00:01:39.177 --> 00:01:40.058]  How does that make you feel?
[00:01:40.298 --> 00:01:46.683]  I think it's just going to take a cycle or two to really be able to prepare for this.
[00:01:46.983 --> 00:01:54.326]  I think it's kind of scary looking into the future and realizing all these people who have worked their way up into these positions.
[00:01:54.446 --> 00:01:59.388]  And if you see them backing out, you kind of wonder, like, yeah, I don't know that much about the situation myself.
[00:02:00.108 --> 00:02:05.930]  And if these people who are knowledgeable of the information and know what's going on, if they're backing out themselves, it kind of makes me worried.
[00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.471]  Where there is a gap, the market will fill it.
[00:02:10.212 --> 00:02:15.934]  So if those doctors retire, then we'll have more strip malls having Doc in a Box.
[00:02:16.397 --> 00:02:22.882]  And some people are against Obamacare just because the fact that the government is now allowed to make you buy a product or service.
[00:02:23.022 --> 00:02:24.423]  We just want you to go ahead and get this health care.
[00:02:24.443 --> 00:02:25.384]  Would you be for that?
[00:02:25.784 --> 00:02:29.507]  If everyone had some basic coverage, I think it benefits the society.
[00:02:29.948 --> 00:02:38.755]  And on that buying a product or service, we see a small town in Georgia now has a city ordinance forcing their residents to purchase firearms, to own firearms in their home.
[00:02:39.155 --> 00:02:39.896]  How do you feel about that?
[00:02:41.877 --> 00:02:45.320]  There's a lot of people shouldn't have access to firearms, so I think that's absurd.
[00:02:45.834 --> 00:02:50.279]  Now does this cross any lines as far as the government making you own a product or service?
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.883]  To me that's a totally different situation.
[00:02:54.103 --> 00:03:00.471]  Stop by the Info Wars shop and pick up Doctored, the film the American Medical Association doesn't want you to see.
