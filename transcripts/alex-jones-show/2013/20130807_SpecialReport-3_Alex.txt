[00:00:08.715 --> 00:00:18.884]  The FBI raid that rescued 105 sexually exploited children from a sex trafficking ring last weekend only helped to highlight the vulnerability of foster children.
[00:00:18.904 --> 00:00:25.110]  60% of runaways who are victims of sex trafficking have been in the custody of Child Protective Services.
[00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:30.933]  Many times when these children are rescued from sex traffickers, they are put right back into the foster care system.
[00:00:31.353 --> 00:00:42.940]  And now with these so-called child protectors snatching up even more kids into the system so they can collect more money from the feds, there has become a surplus of children and not enough foster homes to take care of them.
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.683]  Which means the bar has been set really low for those who can qualify to foster.
[00:00:48.664 --> 00:00:58.659]  A 2011 audit of Sacramento foster care facilities found the addresses of more than 1,000 registered sex offenders matched the address of licensed foster care facilities and homes.
[00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:02.285]  Almost 600 of those offenders were considered high risk.
[00:01:03.206 --> 00:01:03.466]  Thank you.
[00:01:19.648 --> 00:01:21.850]  The consumers are not who you would expect either.
[00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.435]  They are doctors, lawyers, business executives, teachers, coaches, and everyone in between.
[00:01:27.875 --> 00:01:29.817]  In other words, they don't look evil.
[00:01:30.438 --> 00:01:40.627]  Press TV reports rogue elements of police and intelligence services employ child prostitution rings to obtain blackmail material on politicians and other key power brokers.
[00:01:41.027 --> 00:01:49.998]  Former CIA Director William Colby told Nebraska State Legislator John DeCamp that a rogue element of the CIA was heavily involved in ritual child abuse.
[00:01:50.339 --> 00:01:59.530]  He informed DeCamp that not only were the abused children being used in blackmail projects, but the CIA was also using them to conduct mind control experiments.
[00:02:00.191 --> 00:02:10.582]  What became known as the Franklin Scandal was a nationwide pedophile ring that implicated businessmen, senators, major media corporations, the CIA, and the Boys Town organization.
[00:02:11.123 --> 00:02:15.007]  The Finders was another notorious CIA-linked child pimping ring.
[00:02:15.447 --> 00:02:21.454]  Two men were arrested in 1987 for brutally abusing six children between the ages of three and six.
[00:02:22.074 --> 00:02:24.695]  An investigation led police to Washington, D.C.
[00:02:24.735 --> 00:02:33.878]  warehouses where evidence of a global child trafficking network was found, including proof that the children were used in blood rituals and sexual orgies.
[00:02:34.438 --> 00:02:39.980]  The investigation was promptly called off when the CIA deemed the Finders case an internal matter.
[00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.463]  The world is no doubt a better place after the takedown of these 150 low-level sex traffickers.
[00:02:46.923 --> 00:02:57.129]  But now the FBI must take their investigation all the way to the top and bring down these elite pedophile organizations that continue to be too powerful for prosecution.
