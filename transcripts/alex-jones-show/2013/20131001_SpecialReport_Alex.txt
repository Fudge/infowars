[00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:13.964]  Obamacare not only opens up Americans to the obvious cyber threat nationally, but also globally.
[00:00:15.005 --> 00:00:28.156]  Cyber vulnerabilities originate from the required Obamacare Federal Data Services Hub, which involves the NSA, DHS, DOJ, HHS, Social Security Administration, and let's not forget the IRS.
[00:00:28.576 --> 00:00:35.982]  At first glance, it may seem like a simple case of everyone knowing your personal health information, which is bad enough, but the damage is far-reaching.
[00:00:36.242 --> 00:00:43.547]  The first part of it starts with the High Tech Act, a mandate that requires physicians to transfer to computerized versions of patient paper charts by 2015.
[00:00:45.028 --> 00:00:51.053]  Once the doctors have figured out the new computer systems, and bear in mind they have less time than their staff to spend on training,
[00:00:51.633 --> 00:00:55.115]  Then they have to deal with normal computer glitches like missing information.
[00:00:55.335 --> 00:00:59.257]  Things like that have caused complications, and a few have even tragically led to deaths.
[00:00:59.718 --> 00:01:05.541]  Doctors are no match for cyber hackers like Hidden Links, who's believed to be a China-based cyber hacking group.
[00:01:06.181 --> 00:01:08.362]  Symantec estimates the group has 100 employees,
[00:01:09.483 --> 00:01:11.865]  And says it's been operating for four years.
[00:01:12.245 --> 00:01:16.749]  They are bleeding-edge computer scientists making serious amounts of money.
[00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:23.234]  Cyber criminals target health insurance information because they can take the records and commit various frauds and identity theft.
[00:01:23.955 --> 00:01:33.743]  And not only that, but they'll have access now to birthdates, social security numbers, diagnosis, treatments, and thanks to the IRS, now they'll have access to financials.
[00:01:34.864 --> 00:01:38.227]  And Obamacare invites Big Pharma into your privates.
[00:01:38.669 --> 00:01:45.553]  It's where they access the patient's chart, prescribe, and bill, said Ed Fotch, MD, executive chairman of the PDR Network.
[00:01:46.113 --> 00:01:52.877]  Fotch's firm is not an electronic health records or EHR vendor, but its drug information is delivered to prescribers via EHRs.
[00:01:53.437 --> 00:01:56.178]  So the wolves are waiting at your door to devour you.
[00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:08.085]  And it's not just the ones in our administration, like the NSA, but also the Chinese cyber hackers who look at you as fair game, because the United States has now made the EHR a requirement.
