[00:00:03.339 --> 00:00:05.261]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:00:05.581 --> 00:00:07.302]  Great Talk Radio starts here.
[00:00:15.168 --> 00:00:15.829]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.469 --> 00:00:17.510]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:18.251 --> 00:00:19.552]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.992 --> 00:00:20.813]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.594 --> 00:00:22.574]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:23.135 --> 00:00:26.978]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.318 --> 00:00:31.421]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.513 --> 00:00:54.681]  We are getting conflicting reports on whether or not President Barack Obama is going to launch a bombing raid or raids on Syria.
[00:00:55.561 --> 00:01:00.203]  Now, officially in all the polls, the whole narrative that
[00:01:02.631 --> 00:01:06.692]  Assad launched the chemical attack, has officially imploded.
[00:01:09.873 --> 00:01:25.597]  And we have the Associated Press writer, who we've confirmed is an Associated Press writer, writing for a separate syndicator, interviewing multiple rebels who have admitted responsibility
[00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:28.160]  For the chemical weapons attack.
[00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:38.503]  You've got World Daily with video on official jihadi websites showing them loading mortars up on artillery to fire chemicals.
[00:01:40.103 --> 00:01:45.185]  You have the Saudi Arabian ambassador, and that's not even the one in Telegraph, by the way.
[00:01:45.865 --> 00:01:46.886]  We reported on it days ago.
[00:01:46.946 --> 00:01:47.786]  It's not on the Telegraph.
[00:01:50.191 --> 00:01:57.972]  Threatening Russia to activate Al Qaeda they control in Chechnya and other areas and to attack the Olympics that are coming up in Russia if they don't play ball.
[00:01:59.373 --> 00:02:07.774]  And we posted this video last night and literally no one has given this any attention.
[00:02:09.935 --> 00:02:16.456]  But there's now an article out today from StoryLink.com and we have it mirrored up on InfoWars.com
[00:02:19.048 --> 00:02:22.991]  Ron Paul, Syria chemical attack, a false flag.
[00:02:23.031 --> 00:02:25.673]  And we're going to play that clip coming up in the next segment.
[00:02:26.334 --> 00:02:29.636]  He said this a couple days ago on Neil Cavuto.
[00:02:31.138 --> 00:02:33.479]  And the headline is, why are we on the side of Al-Qaeda?
[00:02:33.499 --> 00:02:37.062]  We have a separate article this morning with that headline about the same video.
[00:02:38.223 --> 00:02:44.828]  By the way, Ron Paul was on this a few weeks ago and said, the former congressman, said that he was worried.
[00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:47.651]  That he was worried.
[00:02:49.046 --> 00:02:49.747]  I don't know.
[00:03:11.283 --> 00:03:15.706]  Everybody I talk to on the street is like, Alex, I used to think you were a kook.
[00:03:15.766 --> 00:03:18.368]  I mean, this happened to me this morning on the hiking bike trail.
[00:03:18.788 --> 00:03:20.590]  Hey, man, I used to think you were nuts.
[00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:27.955]  You know, I'm a retired Army officer, and I gotta tell you, our government really does run Al Qaeda, and they really are staging all this stuff.
[00:03:27.995 --> 00:03:29.556]  And why would Assad do that?
[00:03:29.576 --> 00:03:32.618]  Why would he attack with chemicals knowing he'll get bombarded?
[00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:35.140]  I tell you, Obama wants to distract us with what's going on.
[00:03:35.581 --> 00:03:37.342]  People are really getting it.
[00:03:38.803 --> 00:03:46.607]  And this shows we have hope on so many fronts that fool me once, shame on me.
[00:03:46.627 --> 00:03:50.488]  No, not really.
[00:03:50.528 --> 00:03:53.330]  The old saying is fool me once, shame on you.
[00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.291]  Fool me twice, shame on me.
[00:03:58.492 --> 00:04:03.895]  Well, we've been fooled over and over and over and over and over again and people now are on to the tricks.
[00:04:04.675 --> 00:04:05.956]  They're on to the tricks and
[00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:22.153]  Whether it's global warming, and we've got to all pay Al Gore money, or the Statue of Liberty is going to be underwater, or whether it is political correctness that's really radical authoritarianism masquerading as justice, people are really getting it.
[00:04:24.475 --> 00:04:27.538]  Just like the poll three days ago, the Washington Post reported on
[00:04:28.885 --> 00:04:35.289]  The Reuters poll, only 9% of respondents back the Obama administration and their plan to intervene.
[00:04:35.609 --> 00:04:36.470]  Here's the problem.
[00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:37.771]  This has imploded.
[00:04:37.791 --> 00:04:38.951]  It kind of hit me this morning.
[00:04:39.852 --> 00:04:41.613]  This has imploded so bad.
[00:04:44.455 --> 00:04:46.476]  And it's such an embarrassment for the system.
[00:04:46.836 --> 00:04:50.618]  They may go ahead for bravado and false hubris.
[00:04:51.738 --> 00:04:56.780]  They may go ahead with this attack just to say, we did the right thing, it doesn't matter what you say.
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.442]  And maybe even stage some terror attacks, blaming it on Assad.
[00:05:01.282 --> 00:05:04.443]  Because if they lose credibility on this, it could implode on every level.
[00:05:06.844 --> 00:05:08.585]  So, that's what my gut tells me.
[00:05:10.765 --> 00:05:13.526]  Protecting your home with a security system is a must.
[00:05:13.746 --> 00:05:19.789]  But when it comes to protecting your family, your home and belongings, there's no need to sign a long-term contract.
[00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:26.553]  Listen, there is some real scum in the alarm business cashing in by locking you into long, punishing contracts.
[00:05:26.933 --> 00:05:28.894]  Not with SimpliSafe Home Security.
[00:05:29.234 --> 00:05:30.254]  They're the good guys.
[00:05:30.575 --> 00:05:33.216]  You can trust SimpliSafe to protect your family.
[00:05:33.616 --> 00:05:37.939]  SimpliSafe was created by a Harvard Business School engineer and it's revolutionary.

[00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:08.858]  Visit GetSimplySafe.com GetSimplySafe.com GetSimplySafe.com
[00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:15.480]  Tyranny is here.
[00:06:15.821 --> 00:06:19.742]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:06:19.762 --> 00:06:21.964]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:06:21.984 --> 00:06:27.446]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:06:27.866 --> 00:06:34.149]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:06:34.529 --> 00:06:40.072]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:06:40.492 --> 00:06:44.194]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:06:44.674 --> 00:06:48.655]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:06:48.955 --> 00:06:54.897]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:06:54.917 --> 00:06:57.838]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:06:58.459 --> 00:06:59.859]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:07:00.439 --> 00:07:00.939]  It's here.

[00:07:10.825 --> 00:07:12.907]  It's hurricane and wildfire season again.
[00:07:12.927 --> 00:07:20.515]  Why do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year, betting their lives that the disaster won't get them?
[00:07:20.955 --> 00:07:25.620]  Hundreds of you helped eFoodsDirect ship 50,000 donated meals to the Oklahoma victims.
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:27.822]  The problem is we can't help everybody.
[00:07:28.062 --> 00:07:29.604]  If every one of us who can,
[00:07:29.944 --> 00:07:31.184]  We'll take care of ourselves.
[00:07:31.444 --> 00:07:34.165]  We can all pitch in to take care of those who really can't.
[00:07:34.465 --> 00:07:42.267]  The new Just-In-Case Pack from eFoods Direct is the big brother to the 7-Day Emergency Pack designed for Oklahoma disaster donations.
[00:07:42.667 --> 00:07:48.989]  It contains a 2-month supply for 1 person, or a 1-month supply for 2 adults, or a 2-week supply for a family of 4.
[00:07:49.049 --> 00:07:50.049]  The $320 price is $50 less than retail.
[00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:59.533]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[00:07:59.853 --> 00:08:02.735]  Order two or more, get 10% off, free shipping applies.
[00:08:03.075 --> 00:08:08.978]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[00:08:11.439 --> 00:08:21.044]  There's an old saying in Tennessee, I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee, that says, fool me once, shame on me.
[00:08:21.085 --> 00:08:21.645]  Shame on you.
[00:08:22.992 --> 00:08:24.333]  The fool man can't get fooled again.
[00:08:25.114 --> 00:08:27.256]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[00:08:27.517 --> 00:08:30.240]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:33.102]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:08:43.777 --> 00:08:46.998]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:08:47.038 --> 00:08:47.978]  until 2 p.m.
[00:08:48.118 --> 00:08:49.719]  Central Standard Time.
[00:08:50.359 --> 00:08:52.720]  We are here live ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.521]  And then of course we come back Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:08:56.561 --> 00:08:58.322]  Central with a live Sunday broadcast.
[00:08:59.082 --> 00:09:04.303]  Now, I was intending to take this Sunday off and put together a partially original broadcast.
[00:09:04.783 --> 00:09:06.723]  I was going to tape some of it today.
[00:09:06.744 --> 00:09:08.784]  I was going to add in some nightly news interviews.
[00:09:09.484 --> 00:09:14.385]  We're going to have that show waiting in the wings for the Sunday broadcast, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:09:14.505 --> 00:09:24.147]  But if there are missile strikes or fighter-bomber strikes, cruise missile strikes on Syria today, tomorrow, or Sunday, I will be live.
[00:09:25.047 --> 00:09:28.431]  And by the way, volunteers to come in on Monday.
[00:09:28.832 --> 00:09:30.754]  David Knight wants to come in on Monday.
[00:09:30.814 --> 00:09:32.537]  He always does a great job sitting in.
[00:09:32.577 --> 00:09:37.162]  One of the InfoWars Nightly News reporters does a great job sitting in on the syndicated broadcast.
[00:09:37.483 --> 00:09:39.125]  David Knight will be live Monday.
[00:09:40.472 --> 00:09:44.794]  But if there's been a strike, I will be here live on Monday.
[00:09:45.154 --> 00:09:54.699]  I will already be here on Monday, but I need to take that day off from radio to work on Obama Deception 2, that undoubtedly will be the most powerful film ever made.
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:00.962]  And I said earlier in the week I would announce the specific days of when it's coming out.
[00:10:02.243 --> 00:10:03.384]  I will do it today at 1230.
[00:10:05.478 --> 00:10:11.423]  I will announce, and I'm not doing that to push it off, I need to meet with the guys actually and just double-check the dates.
[00:10:11.463 --> 00:10:16.186]  I've got them in my mind, but I want to double-check them on the calendar, double-check with the manufacturers.
[00:10:16.206 --> 00:10:17.447]  We'll be printing them up and everything.
[00:10:18.128 --> 00:10:19.349]  We're still making the film right now.
[00:10:19.409 --> 00:10:24.333]  We'll be doing it until, up until the end of October.
[00:10:26.215 --> 00:10:27.496]  There's just so much we're putting into it.
[00:10:27.896 --> 00:10:29.097]  There's never been a film like this.
[00:10:29.157 --> 00:10:30.718]  I mean, it is unbelievable.
[00:10:31.179 --> 00:10:45.850]  I almost don't even want to hype it up, because last time they had the FBI show up here asking about the Obama deception, five days before it was going to come out, contacting our servers, contacting companies that we have servers with, and calling my crew members, and they were really freaked out about it.
[00:10:46.591 --> 00:10:52.455]  And I guess they had some metric, because it later got watched tens of millions of times, knowing there was a big buildup or something.
[00:10:53.356 --> 00:10:54.697]  And so I just launched it early.
[00:10:56.274 --> 00:11:03.639]  I just released it for free early, so this one's really, really devastating.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:13.565]  And the graphics, the material, the information, the angles we go with, because there's such a big ocean of corruption, you've got to go with an angle.
[00:11:14.345 --> 00:11:19.088]  And we're not spinning it to make Obama and the globalists look bad, they're so bad,
[00:11:20.365 --> 00:11:40.475]  It's like, how do you take thousands of horrible things they've done, and hundreds and hundreds of confirmed lies, and over a hundred impeachable offenses on record, and try to show all that, and not just make it a film where you're reading out the sins of the New World Order for eternity, as they commit more, even faster, than you can do it?
[00:11:41.036 --> 00:11:43.337]  I mean, it is unbelievable.
[00:11:43.977 --> 00:11:47.885]  The stuff we've got is just unbelievable.
[00:11:48.486 --> 00:11:50.910]  I've been up here till like 10 o'clock at night almost every night.
[00:11:52.026 --> 00:11:55.568]  And I wouldn't be doing this and not seeing my children.
[00:11:55.908 --> 00:11:57.789]  I love taking my kids to play putt-putt golf.
[00:11:58.169 --> 00:11:59.910]  I love taking them to play laser tag.
[00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:01.330]  I love taking them for hikes.
[00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:02.451]  I love taking them fishing.
[00:12:02.791 --> 00:12:03.971]  I love taking them to visit friends.
[00:12:03.991 --> 00:12:05.592]  You know, they got boats and jet skis and stuff.
[00:12:06.112 --> 00:12:08.613]  I love taking them to visit family and go camping.
[00:12:09.254 --> 00:12:13.976]  I absolutely love sitting in the backyard, jumping on the trampoline, shooting BB guns.
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:22.782]  I absolutely love sitting on the couch and watching an old, you know, 50s Doris Day, you know, movie with Jack Lemmon.
[00:12:24.242 --> 00:12:33.244]  I literally see my kids about 10 hours a week now, about an hour in the morning and a couple hours on the weekend.
[00:12:33.824 --> 00:12:41.546]  And the reason I'm talking about myself here is I realize they have no future if I don't fully commit and do everything I can.
[00:12:43.103 --> 00:12:50.968]  But then there is the catch-22 of, you get so overwrought and so hyped up, I turn into like a gibbering chimpanzee half the time on the air.
[00:12:51.288 --> 00:12:52.668]  But I know people can put up with that.
[00:12:52.708 --> 00:12:54.449]  Now, enough talking about myself.
[00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:58.712]  These are the times that do try men and women's souls.
[00:12:59.773 --> 00:13:03.815]  And it is the best of times, it is the worst of times on so many fronts.
[00:13:04.675 --> 00:13:05.416]  Obviously,
[00:13:06.584 --> 00:13:10.268]  We're going to get into the serious situation front and center.
[00:13:10.589 --> 00:13:14.333]  Paul Watson's joining us with bombshell info in the next segment.
[00:13:14.714 --> 00:13:16.996]  Then Joel Scowls and World Affairs Brief Editor.
[00:13:17.297 --> 00:13:18.718]  Incredible geopolitical mind.
[00:13:19.099 --> 00:13:20.661]  He's going to be popping in from an airport.
[00:13:21.642 --> 00:13:23.164]  He's going through TSA I think right now.
[00:13:24.817 --> 00:13:25.938]  He's a pilot.
[00:13:25.959 --> 00:13:26.839]  He may be flying himself.
[00:13:26.879 --> 00:13:27.200]  I don't know.
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.522]  He just said he's got to get to the airport and then he can call us.
[00:13:29.903 --> 00:13:30.803]  So that's coming up.
[00:13:31.905 --> 00:13:35.829]  And we're going to then have open phones in the second and third hour today.
[00:13:35.849 --> 00:13:40.914]  I'll do my best to actually go to your calls and not get sidetracked off into rabbit trails here.
[00:13:41.935 --> 00:13:47.260]  But folks know that when negative news is going on and we've got bad news,
[00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:49.382]  I will tell you the bad news.
[00:13:49.462 --> 00:13:55.150]  I don't get up here and cheerlead something that's a devastating victory for liberty if it isn't a devastating victory for liberty.
[00:13:56.992 --> 00:14:04.623]  But everything together shows me a ultra-massive sea change.
[00:14:06.984 --> 00:14:12.446]  A turning of the lake, a turning of the political ocean, of the political tides.
[00:14:13.046 --> 00:14:15.927]  And there is a tide in the affairs of men when taken at the flood.
[00:14:16.287 --> 00:14:27.190]  Leads on to fortune, as Shakespeare wrote in his piece on the Roman times of Julius Caesar.
[00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:33.692]  And our fortune is liberty in our time, justice in our time, to turn the criminal tide.
[00:14:34.406 --> 00:14:39.132]  And let me tell you, there is a tide in the affairs of men when taking it to flood leads on to fortune.
[00:14:39.573 --> 00:14:44.559]  We are on that wave, we've caught the wave, we are surfing the apocalypse.
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:47.443]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the real deal.
[00:14:48.284 --> 00:14:52.590]  So get your game face on, get in the zone, and
[00:14:55.976 --> 00:14:57.437]  We can turn things around.
[00:14:57.917 --> 00:15:07.284]  If you believe the self-fulfilling prophecy put out by the globalist-run churches of the last 150 years, that it's always the end of the world, and there's no reason to fight evil, we're doomed.
[00:15:08.805 --> 00:15:13.628]  Whether it's the end of the world down the road or not, and the Antichrist and all that, it doesn't matter.
[00:15:14.008 --> 00:15:15.629]  Justice be done, may the heavens fall.
[00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:18.751]  Duty is ours, consequences belong to God.
[00:15:19.512 --> 00:15:22.954]  Duty is like a mountain, death is like wings.
[00:15:23.895 --> 00:15:24.415]  It comes.
[00:15:24.955 --> 00:15:25.676]  You can't stop it.
[00:15:28.755 --> 00:15:38.537]  And so, we have, like, Atlas duty on our shoulders.
[00:15:40.497 --> 00:15:43.498]  But it is empowering to do the right thing.
[00:15:46.018 --> 00:15:47.478]  And that is when you will be fulfilled.
[00:15:47.578 --> 00:15:57.060]  And I just hate to keep going back to that, but the whole Madison Avenue, whole world system is about you're going to be fulfilled when you do what we say.
[00:15:58.052 --> 00:16:03.414]  You're going to be fulfilled when you sign on to our agenda and that will fulfill you.
[00:16:03.454 --> 00:16:04.975]  Well, it doesn't fulfill you.
[00:16:05.035 --> 00:16:05.876]  It's the opposite.
[00:16:06.116 --> 00:16:08.537]  Because if you're fulfilled, you don't need them.
[00:16:09.057 --> 00:16:19.942]  If you're confident and know that your morals and who you are and what you stand for and your integrity is your greatest possession, then all the rest of the stuff cannot affect you and you cannot be bought.
[00:16:21.844 --> 00:16:25.146]  That's why the globalists want us impoverished in a permanent peasant class.
[00:16:25.306 --> 00:16:26.607]  That's why they want us dependent.
[00:16:26.667 --> 00:16:30.969]  Because they want us to be absolutely undeveloped.
[00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:34.190]  They want an arrested development.
[00:16:34.551 --> 00:16:36.131]  They want to destroy our free will.
[00:16:36.411 --> 00:16:37.832]  They are afraid of your potential.
[00:16:38.012 --> 00:16:39.473]  They know how beautiful humans are.
[00:16:39.693 --> 00:16:40.994]  They know how powerful we are.
[00:16:41.474 --> 00:16:48.858]  And so they've wrecked us in the last 70, 80 years under the psych warfare systems of Edward Bernays and Joseph Goebbels and all the others.
[00:16:49.861 --> 00:16:51.843]  Who all wrote books bragging about their sciences.
[00:16:52.223 --> 00:16:53.445]  This is all there for you to learn.
[00:16:53.925 --> 00:16:55.607]  I'm here telling you all their tricks.
[00:16:55.767 --> 00:16:56.488]  I've read their books.
[00:16:57.028 --> 00:16:58.590]  I study their latest operations.
[00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:00.932]  I'm here saying I don't have all the answers.
[00:17:01.773 --> 00:17:05.357]  They act like we're all idiots and are operating in plain view.
[00:17:06.138 --> 00:17:08.260]  I've simply got the glasses on like they live.
[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:09.281]  I can see it.
[00:17:10.042 --> 00:17:12.925]  I can see formaldehyde face looking at me and I don't like it.
[00:17:14.773 --> 00:17:19.895]  And all I gotta do is get you to put the glasses on and you're not going to be following what I say.
[00:17:20.135 --> 00:17:22.016]  You're not going to be an Alex Jones cult member.
[00:17:22.256 --> 00:17:23.996]  You're going to have glasses on, folks.
[00:17:24.177 --> 00:17:25.197]  Just look around you.
[00:17:25.497 --> 00:17:27.798]  Stop thinking it's work to be informed.
[00:17:28.338 --> 00:17:31.599]  Stop thinking it's bad to know what's going on in the world.
[00:17:31.879 --> 00:17:33.200]  It's work to be ignorant.
[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.001]  It's work to not be informed.
[00:17:35.521 --> 00:17:37.622]  It's work to not get stuff organized.
[00:17:39.102 --> 00:17:40.943]  It's work to lay down.
[00:17:43.143 --> 00:17:51.136]  If you were walking through northern Canada and a bunch of wolves came along, if you act scared, they're going to chase you down and they're going to eat you.
[00:17:51.837 --> 00:17:58.147]  But if you start charging them and fuming at the mouth, they're going to run crying in fear, even if they're starving in most cases.
[00:18:00.959 --> 00:18:05.222]  It is the spirit of liberty that will dispel the spirit of tyranny.
[00:18:05.242 --> 00:18:05.722]  Do you understand?
[00:18:05.742 --> 00:18:06.663]  It is a spirit.
[00:18:07.103 --> 00:18:08.364]  I know I said this earlier in the week.
[00:18:08.604 --> 00:18:14.849]  It's just more and more I realize we've got to have the spirit of people that are free and then that will animate us.
[00:18:15.749 --> 00:18:18.491]  But God is not like the New World Order.
[00:18:19.352 --> 00:18:23.415]  The power of the universe that flows out of God, that flows out of justice,
[00:18:25.734 --> 00:18:26.635]  Respects free will.
[00:18:27.215 --> 00:18:29.916]  You've got to want to be empowered.
[00:18:30.136 --> 00:18:32.017]  You've got to want to get past your fear.
[00:18:32.257 --> 00:18:34.199]  You've got to want to stand against tyrants.
[00:18:34.239 --> 00:18:35.579]  Now, what's coming up today?
[00:18:35.619 --> 00:18:41.162]  Because it is bombshell on top of bombshell on top of bombshell.
[00:18:43.543 --> 00:18:46.345]  Ron Paul has gone on Fox News and it's getting no attention.
[00:18:47.285 --> 00:18:48.626]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[00:18:48.666 --> 00:18:49.947]  It's up on StoryLeak.com.
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:54.421]  Ron Paul, Syria chemical attack, a false flag.
[00:18:54.461 --> 00:18:55.561]  That is an exact quote.
[00:18:55.821 --> 00:18:56.981]  We're going to play that coming up.
[00:18:57.601 --> 00:19:00.562]  That video is up on Infowars.com right now.
[00:19:02.642 --> 00:19:07.123]  Now, expanding on that bombshell, Paul Watson has an AP writer.
[00:19:10.044 --> 00:19:14.825]  Rebels admit responsibility for chemical weapons attack since Saudi Arabia gave it to them.
[00:19:15.865 --> 00:19:19.606]  And the story fits exactly with the type of mortars, but this is only one of the events.
[00:19:20.007 --> 00:19:26.169]  We know there's been other chemical attacks and the rebels filming themselves with the mortar shells at least three other times.
[00:19:26.489 --> 00:19:31.091]  That's why this is so frustrating is this is hiding in plain view like
[00:19:32.293 --> 00:19:34.174]  The Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco.
[00:19:34.294 --> 00:19:37.196]  I mean, I mean, this is in your face.
[00:19:37.936 --> 00:19:38.497]  Bombshell.
[00:19:38.737 --> 00:19:41.659]  That's up on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:19:42.239 --> 00:19:45.701]  So important to get that article out to everybody you know.
[00:19:46.101 --> 00:19:50.664]  We've tweeted it out at Real Alex Jones on Twitter and our other Twitter sites.
[00:19:50.704 --> 00:19:51.725]  Send that forward to people.
[00:19:54.861 --> 00:19:56.663]  And then there's even more coming out.
[00:19:56.703 --> 00:19:57.483]  Now here's the issue.
[00:19:58.304 --> 00:20:00.146]  The British Parliament voted not to attack.
[00:20:00.166 --> 00:20:02.188]  The British government's separate from that.
[00:20:02.448 --> 00:20:03.429]  Says they may go ahead.
[00:20:03.449 --> 00:20:06.471]  We're not sure what's going to happen here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:20:06.491 --> 00:20:07.272]  But we're going to cover it.
[00:20:07.652 --> 00:20:08.033]  Coming up.
[00:20:10.871 --> 00:20:15.755]  There are those curious about bitcoins and those using and making money with bitcoins.
[00:20:16.235 --> 00:20:17.416]  What are bitcoins?
[00:20:17.876 --> 00:20:23.941]  A bitcoin is the first decentralized currency that can be easily transferred from person to person over the internet.
[00:20:24.361 --> 00:20:25.782]  No bank needed.
[00:20:26.182 --> 00:20:31.486]  This means lower fees and accounts can never be frozen, limited or closed.
[00:20:31.867 --> 00:20:33.648]  You are in control of your money.

[00:20:38.913 --> 00:20:46.321]  No computer or expertise is required to earn money with bitcoins and a growing number of merchants now accept bitcoins.
[00:20:46.801 --> 00:20:50.445]  Plus, they're easily exchanged for dollars, euros and more.

[00:24:18.404 --> 00:24:19.864]  You're the pretender.
[00:24:19.884 --> 00:24:22.605]  What if I say I will never surrender?
[00:24:23.286 --> 00:24:25.907]  We are back live on this Friday Worldwide Edition.
[00:24:26.407 --> 00:24:28.087]  Headlines at Infowars.com.
[00:24:28.167 --> 00:24:31.049]  Rebels admit responsibility for chemical weapons attack.
[00:24:31.509 --> 00:24:33.710]  And during the break, we're backing it up on the...
[00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:42.177]  On the recording system, CNN was reporting another chemical attack in Syria.
[00:24:42.537 --> 00:24:43.919]  What did I say at the start of the show?
[00:24:44.099 --> 00:24:51.446]  I think Obama will launch another false flag, or his controllers will, to get the new bombing operation going because
[00:24:52.006 --> 00:24:57.648]  As everybody turns against him, and as people say it's fake, and as Mainline News asks, why are we with Al-Qaeda?
[00:24:57.988 --> 00:25:01.489]  And Ron Paul goes on Fox News and says it's a false flag staged attack.
[00:25:01.549 --> 00:25:06.330]  As all this comes out, they'll have to have a new event to change the subject about the old event.
[00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:07.951]  That's how their psychology works.
[00:25:08.511 --> 00:25:09.971]  And it just broke on CNN.
[00:25:09.991 --> 00:25:14.333]  In fact, if you can back that up on the tape back there, on the DVR.
[00:25:14.353 --> 00:25:15.893]  I want to show where they had it on the screen.
[00:25:16.253 --> 00:25:16.693]  There it is.
[00:25:17.233 --> 00:25:19.134]  Reports of another chemical attack.
[00:25:20.723 --> 00:25:25.028]  Syrian opposition group claims it happened Monday now.
[00:25:25.609 --> 00:25:29.174]  And the truth is the rebels are uploading videos constantly of themselves.
[00:25:29.674 --> 00:25:31.537]  They got caught three separate times before this.
[00:25:32.257 --> 00:25:33.539]  Launching chemical attacks.
[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:35.341]  They got caught by the foreign press.
[00:25:35.401 --> 00:25:36.443]  It's never in the news here.
[00:25:37.742 --> 00:25:43.303]  Joining us briefly is Paul Watson from London, who broke the story in the international media.
[00:25:43.624 --> 00:25:49.345]  It already came out with this AP writer who couldn't get it, I guess, published in AP, so he wrote it for another wire.
[00:25:49.365 --> 00:25:59.528]  A respected reporter who's over there talked to multiple rebels by name who admitted in one case they were given it by Saudi Arabia and it blew up on them.
[00:26:00.328 --> 00:26:02.710]  So, joining us is Paul Watson.
[00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:07.253]  Paul, this whole thing is unraveling fast, but I think they're going to stage something.
[00:26:07.293 --> 00:26:11.835]  In fact, it may have already happened, to try to change the subject onto the new event.
[00:26:11.875 --> 00:26:12.416]  Paul Watson.
[00:26:13.502 --> 00:26:16.083]  Well, I mean, they've been completely discredited, Alex.
[00:26:16.123 --> 00:26:20.423]  You had the so-called intelligence that Assad was behind the attack.
[00:26:20.483 --> 00:26:30.826]  It consisted of the Syrian Defense Ministry making panicked phone calls to the Chemical Weapons Department demanding answers as to what happened in the attack last week.
[00:26:31.186 --> 00:26:38.667]  If they were behind the attack, if they had ordered it, why would they be calling up panicked saying what the hell's going on to their own Chemical Weapons Department?
[00:26:39.307 --> 00:26:41.428]  Then you have this bombshell story today which
[00:26:42.208 --> 00:26:50.172]  You know, imagine if a member of the Syrian government had admitted to an AP reporter that Assad was behind the chemical weapons attack.
[00:26:50.553 --> 00:26:53.234]  It would be all over the news instantly.
[00:26:53.554 --> 00:26:58.917]  You know, instead today they're obsessing about a Facebook post by Assad's 11-year-old son.
[00:26:58.997 --> 00:26:59.737]  If it's even true!
[00:27:00.598 --> 00:27:02.959]  Yeah, and this story is being completely ignored.
[00:27:03.339 --> 00:27:03.980]  And basically...
[00:27:04.978 --> 00:27:19.137]  A reporter who reports for the AP has done work with BBC News, NPR, Salon.com called Dale Gavlak, visited the area in Ghouta that was hit by the chemical weapons incident last week in Syria.
[00:27:19.838 --> 00:27:21.479]  Talked to the rebels there.
[00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:23.441]  They told her directly.
[00:27:23.842 --> 00:27:27.305]  They were given the chemical weapons by Saudi intelligence.
[00:27:27.845 --> 00:27:30.587]  Prince Bandar bin Sultan arranged it all.
[00:27:31.028 --> 00:27:38.634]  He, of course, is the guy who threatened Putin with terrorist attacks on the Olympics next year if he didn't abandon support for Syria.
[00:27:39.355 --> 00:27:43.239]  The rebels told this AP reporter they were given the chemical weapons.
[00:27:43.739 --> 00:27:46.222]  They weren't given training on how to handle them.
[00:27:46.522 --> 00:27:54.169]  Apparently the plan was initially to give them to Jabhat al-Nusra, which of course is the al-Qaeda terrorist group that we're supporting over there.
[00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:58.391]  But they got given to the rebels instead, who mishandled them.
[00:27:58.771 --> 00:28:00.072]  There was an explosion.
[00:28:00.532 --> 00:28:02.372]  Twelve rebels were killed instantly.
[00:28:02.732 --> 00:28:09.314]  And then we had this chemical weapons incident, which led to all the horrific injuries that we saw, the hundreds injured and dead.
[00:28:09.794 --> 00:28:11.315]  So, one of them told a quote.
[00:28:11.815 --> 00:28:21.718]  We were very curious about these arms and unfortunately some of the fighters handled the weapons improperly and set off the explosions, one militant told this Associated Press reporter.
[00:28:22.058 --> 00:28:24.419]  Then she quotes numerous others who say the same thing.
[00:28:24.819 --> 00:28:29.521]  She quotes by name Abdel Monim, the father of one of the rebels, who confirms that
[00:28:30.101 --> 00:28:42.591]  The chemical weapons exploded in a tunnel, killed 12 rebels and led to this chemical weapons incident which has been blamed on Assad and used as the pretext for, you know, Tomahawk cruise missile attacks.
[00:28:43.432 --> 00:28:44.913]  So it's a bombshell story!
[00:28:45.814 --> 00:28:50.458]  The organisation behind it is called Mint News, I believe.
[00:28:50.498 --> 00:28:51.679]  It's Mint Press News.
[00:28:52.179 --> 00:28:55.242]  And it's a legitimate organisation based in Minnesota.
[00:28:55.342 --> 00:28:57.864]  Minnesota posted a profile on them last year.
[00:28:58.284 --> 00:29:00.806]  They've got numerous credible journalists working for them.
[00:29:01.147 --> 00:29:04.930]  The one who wrote this story has done work for BBC, Associated Press.
[00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:06.251]  I'll link to it in the article.
[00:29:06.391 --> 00:29:07.691]  I want him on, absolutely.
[00:29:07.731 --> 00:29:08.311]  I want to get him on.
[00:29:08.331 --> 00:29:09.732]  But it's not just this report.
[00:29:10.012 --> 00:29:15.913]  This fits in with the rebels who are so unprofessional that they brag when they do this.
[00:29:15.933 --> 00:29:17.793]  I mean, they really think they're good guys.
[00:29:17.813 --> 00:29:19.334]  They're very gullible.
[00:29:19.534 --> 00:29:27.075]  They're being given this and they, you know, they, in other attacks, they load it up and fire it and cheer Bin Laden while they do it.
[00:29:27.095 --> 00:29:28.135]  Let me ask you this.
[00:29:28.735 --> 00:29:32.516]  Your parliament just voted down, but still they're saying Cameron can block it.
[00:29:32.556 --> 00:29:35.657]  I want to come back and do three or four minutes more with you about Cameron.
[00:29:36.617 --> 00:29:37.898]  We're on the march.
[00:29:37.918 --> 00:29:38.739]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.685 --> 00:30:06.358]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.462 --> 00:30:14.084]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us?
[00:30:14.324 --> 00:30:19.607]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[00:30:19.847 --> 00:30:27.370]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[00:30:27.571 --> 00:30:36.675]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[00:30:36.875 --> 00:30:43.862]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[00:30:44.062 --> 00:30:46.925]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[00:30:47.105 --> 00:30:53.872]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse but demand a war.
[00:30:54.392 --> 00:30:55.333]  Oh, there's another one!
[00:30:55.393 --> 00:30:56.435]  Another plane just hit!
[00:31:10.856 --> 00:31:24.006]  With over 3,000 years of historic use, PureSilver continues to be one of nature's most reliable and effective agents against fighting viruses, mold, fungus, bacteria, pathogens, and parasites.

[00:32:18.535 --> 00:32:22.337]  Fortunately, a simple, safe and effective alternative exists.

[00:33:25.874 --> 00:33:26.634]  Big Brother.
[00:33:27.034 --> 00:33:28.274]  Mainstream media.
[00:33:28.915 --> 00:33:30.055]  Government cover-ups.
[00:33:30.515 --> 00:33:31.515]  You want answers?
[00:33:32.075 --> 00:33:33.236]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:33.696 --> 00:33:37.396]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:38.797 --> 00:33:39.597]  We're back live!
[00:33:43.052 --> 00:33:43.575]  By the way...
[00:33:45.106 --> 00:33:51.148]  If you go to the State Department's online website, they're getting ready to have Kerry or someone come out and make a statement.
[00:33:51.909 --> 00:33:54.490]  Let's punch that up on screen, that State Department shot for folks.
[00:33:54.510 --> 00:33:54.950]  There it is.
[00:33:56.010 --> 00:33:58.431]  And they've got a live video feed up there.
[00:33:59.031 --> 00:34:09.135]  As you can see, preparing for a statement, CNN just started announcing about 12 minutes ago that there have been new chemical attacks.
[00:34:10.116 --> 00:34:12.617]  Now they're saying five days ago in Monday.
[00:34:13.562 --> 00:34:14.103]  On Monday.
[00:34:15.303 --> 00:34:28.552]  And I've been saying yesterday and today, just because I know how these people operate, if they've been caught in other false flags, they'll launch a new one, maybe even bigger, and say Assad did that, and say that's it.
[00:34:28.612 --> 00:34:30.814]  And that's the talking point on all the controlled press.
[00:34:31.614 --> 00:34:34.096]  CNN, MSNBC, you name it is.
[00:34:34.416 --> 00:34:35.877]  We've got hundreds of thousands dead.
[00:34:35.977 --> 00:34:37.418]  100, 200, no one knows.
[00:34:37.819 --> 00:34:42.382]  And we've got to do something, it's terrible this is happening, when the West started this two and a half years ago.
[00:34:43.851 --> 00:34:45.972]  You got more Russian ships massing, more U.S.
[00:34:46.012 --> 00:34:47.553]  ships massing.
[00:34:47.573 --> 00:34:52.896]  I have seen the public support for this totally implode worldwide.
[00:34:53.237 --> 00:34:55.158]  Nine percent approval rating in Reuters polls.
[00:34:55.778 --> 00:34:57.579]  Germany, England voting it down.
[00:34:57.759 --> 00:34:59.680]  France, warmongering.
[00:35:00.461 --> 00:35:01.421]  That's how weird this is.
[00:35:01.561 --> 00:35:05.504]  France is like foaming at the mouth to take over Libya and Egypt and Syria.
[00:35:05.564 --> 00:35:08.325]  I'm going to ask Joel Skousen when we get him on from World Affairs Brief.
[00:35:08.566 --> 00:35:10.207]  The editor, what's happening with that?
[00:35:11.087 --> 00:35:15.972]  But this is also about being a political distraction domestically, but it's more than that.
[00:35:16.012 --> 00:35:18.795]  It's about taking over the entire Middle East to encircle Russia.
[00:35:19.475 --> 00:35:22.758]  And again, our government's been hijacked by globalists.
[00:35:23.079 --> 00:35:25.241]  Our media's like, were you for America or for Russia?
[00:35:25.681 --> 00:35:28.844]  I'm for not going and starting preemptive wars and being the bad guy.
[00:35:29.707 --> 00:35:31.128]  For globalists, especially.
[00:35:32.069 --> 00:35:42.439]  So, Paul Watson, finishing up, your parliament voted this down by, what, 16 votes, but now they're saying that they may still strike because England won't surrender or retreat.
[00:35:42.859 --> 00:35:45.722]  Surrender from something started by the West?
[00:35:46.102 --> 00:35:50.607]  Surrender from, you know, a 15-year-old sitting on top of a 5-year-old beating him up?
[00:35:50.667 --> 00:35:52.549]  I mean, this is all these countries
[00:35:53.329 --> 00:36:00.597]  Dozens of countries, and NATO, and Saudi Arabia, and Qatar, and all ganged up on Syria to take it out.
[00:36:00.958 --> 00:36:01.999]  Syria's winning.
[00:36:02.379 --> 00:36:04.422]  The world's starting to root for the underdog.
[00:36:05.283 --> 00:36:08.186]  Even if Assad's not a great guy compared to Al-Qaeda, he's wonderful.
[00:36:09.407 --> 00:36:12.210]  In a nutshell, where do you see this going, and what's your gut tell you?
[00:36:12.511 --> 00:36:14.313]  Do you think there's going to be an attack?
[00:36:16.044 --> 00:36:22.653]  Yeah, there's going to be some kind of limited attack just so Obama can save face on his ridiculous red line comment.
[00:36:23.193 --> 00:36:28.921]  And the places they're going to attack in Damascus are amidst the civilian population.
[00:36:28.961 --> 00:36:32.165]  All the military targets are right next to the civilian population.
[00:36:32.225 --> 00:36:34.268]  So when they say it's going to be surgical,
[00:36:34.628 --> 00:36:37.049]  No it's not, it's going to kill innocent people, you know it is.
[00:36:37.569 --> 00:36:46.252]  But the thing about the vote in the UK was, it was the first time since 1782 that a British Prime Minister has lost a vote on war.
[00:36:46.612 --> 00:36:48.312]  So it was completely unprecedented.
[00:36:48.712 --> 00:36:56.775]  Now David Cameron's accusing the people who voted against it as siding with Russia, so it's back to the old Reds under the bed rhetoric I guess.
[00:36:57.535 --> 00:37:03.418]  And then, the damning thing is, the mainstream media won't report on a story like this that we just talked about.
[00:37:03.859 --> 00:37:07.501]  And the only people to report on it, apart from us, is the voice of Russia.
[00:37:07.881 --> 00:37:13.824]  So we have to rely on Russian state media just to try and get a little bit of truth from the opposite side of the equation.
[00:37:13.844 --> 00:37:14.705]  So it's pathetic.
[00:37:14.765 --> 00:37:17.687]  It's another damning indictment of the mainstream media.
[00:37:18.726 --> 00:37:21.307]  And again, our North Star is the truth.
[00:37:21.827 --> 00:37:22.607]  Our job's easy.
[00:37:23.047 --> 00:37:24.387]  We don't have special interest.
[00:37:24.927 --> 00:37:31.469]  We simply think what is justice, what is right, what is good for freedom worldwide, what is common organic law.
[00:37:32.309 --> 00:37:36.930]  And we follow that as our North Star, as our rudder, as our guide.
[00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:43.532]  And it is so sad to see this unfolding, but I've got a stack of news here
[00:37:44.812 --> 00:37:58.038]  Where despite 150 members of Congress demanding a vote on Syria, and that's being picked up by the Associated Press and others, despite that, Paul, Obama's saying, I don't even need anybody's approval.
[00:37:58.618 --> 00:38:03.780]  I'm just going to go ahead with all of this because it's the right thing to do.
[00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:07.982]  And what do you think Kerry's going to say whenever he toddles out on the stage?
[00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:19.247]  From what I've read, he's going to outline the intelligence that they've found to blame the attack on Assad, even as it comes out that the rebels admit responsibility for it.
[00:38:19.947 --> 00:38:25.992]  And it's amazing the fact that they argue this is not about regime change.
[00:38:26.472 --> 00:38:37.180]  Wesley Clarke was told in the weeks after 9-11 by Wolfowitz, by other Pentagon officials, these seven countries are on the list, you know, Libya, Iraq, Syria, they were all on there.
[00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:43.064]  Brookings Institute last year said we need some humanitarian crisis to go in and topple Assad in Syria.
[00:38:43.364 --> 00:38:45.125]  Of course it's about regime change.
[00:38:45.185 --> 00:38:49.528]  It's been about regime change for the best part of 15 years.
[00:38:49.768 --> 00:38:55.112]  So to claim it's not, again, they're lying out their backsides and people are going to die because of it.
[00:38:58.305 --> 00:39:01.066]  Paul, so many other facets to this.
[00:39:01.946 --> 00:39:09.849]  If this attack does take place, Iran has said they're going to probably block the Strait of Hormuz, blocking about a third of the world's oil supply or more.
[00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:11.450]  Some estimates are as high as 40%.
[00:39:14.383 --> 00:39:20.589]  There'll obviously be huge riots and things happening that may even block the Suez Canal, blocking another 10%.
[00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:24.553]  Iran's also saying they're going to fire medium-range missiles at Israel.
[00:39:24.993 --> 00:39:28.716]  Israel has said if they're hit with medium-range missiles, they're going to nuke Iran.
[00:39:30.046 --> 00:39:37.092]  Obviously when that happens, as all the nuclear experts have said, then there will probably be a larger nuclear war.
[00:39:37.652 --> 00:39:48.781]  And that's why most analysts that we've had on here, but even members of the British Defense Establishment, that's General Dempsey, the Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts,
[00:39:50.642 --> 00:39:58.068]  So many others have, Dr. Corsi, they all say this is probably the most dangerous time since the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[00:39:58.608 --> 00:40:08.736]  And the yuppies out there partying and acting silly, and also the dumb Obama supporters and neocons that want war, I don't think they have any idea how much danger we're in.
[00:40:08.756 --> 00:40:11.498]  Because the Iranians have shown they'll do what they say.
[00:40:11.998 --> 00:40:13.740]  The Russians have shown they'll do what they say.
[00:40:14.933 --> 00:40:25.828]  And I think the world realizes if they don't stand up, the Goldman Sachs-run governments, globalist-run governments, are going to continue bringing rebels into their countries and trying to overthrow the governments.
[00:40:26.850 --> 00:40:29.714]  And so it's just nightmarish what we're facing.
[00:40:31.328 --> 00:40:42.995]  Well, I think that Assad's reluctance to actually defend his own country... Don't forget that Israel already attacked Syria with two airstrikes within the past six months and they did nothing about it.
[00:40:43.596 --> 00:40:45.837]  This time, I don't think they're going to do nothing about it.
[00:40:45.917 --> 00:40:50.200]  If there is an attack, then Assad has indicated that he will attack Israel.
[00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:55.463]  In response to that, Israel has said, we're going to go into Damascus, it's going to be regime change.
[00:40:55.523 --> 00:40:58.545]  So, you know, then all the fun of the fair begins.
[00:40:58.605 --> 00:41:00.707]  It's an absolutely ludicrous suggestion.
[00:41:01.207 --> 00:41:07.972]  That to save face for Obama, in their justification, they're going to carry out limited surgical airstrikes.
[00:41:08.032 --> 00:41:09.473]  It's complete insanity.
[00:41:09.973 --> 00:41:12.775]  Rand Paul yesterday said it could start a war with Russia.
[00:41:13.176 --> 00:41:16.238]  Numerous experts have said it could be the start of World War III.
[00:41:16.758 --> 00:41:21.762]  And it's... Everybody else is abandoning it, but Obama's saying, I'm the dictator, I'm going to go ahead anyway.
[00:41:21.802 --> 00:41:24.964]  Ignore Congress, ignore the UN, ignore all the other countries in the world.
[00:41:25.405 --> 00:41:26.946]  Because, you know, he's the dictator.
[00:41:28.490 --> 00:41:29.751]  Amazing, Paul.
[00:41:29.831 --> 00:41:32.712]  We'll be here covering it live Sunday and live Monday.
[00:41:33.672 --> 00:41:36.654]  Live Sunday, if it happens, Monday, regardless, we're going to be live here.
[00:41:36.674 --> 00:41:45.998]  I'm going to be at the office working on Obama Deception 2, probably pop into the show, but David Knight's going to be sitting in here at the Infowars.com studios in Austin, Texas.
[00:41:46.018 --> 00:41:51.320]  You know, it's not just North Korea that's targeting Austin, where I live, it's the Russians and everybody else.
[00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:57.783]  But regardless, if you live in a big city or near a military base in Europe, in the UK, in the United States,
[00:41:58.343 --> 00:42:02.424]  In Australia, you're going to be hit with nuclear weapons when all this goes down.
[00:42:02.744 --> 00:42:10.347]  The Russians have 12,000 high-tech new weapons, thousands of medium-range and tactical weapons, so it's over 14,000.
[00:42:10.567 --> 00:42:13.968]  The United States has conservatively 10,000, probably more like 50,000.
[00:42:14.088 --> 00:42:16.709]  I mean, what they tell the public is not what's going on.
[00:42:17.909 --> 00:42:23.594]  And all sorts of space-based DU, SABO platforms, and a lot of other really nasty stuff.
[00:42:24.354 --> 00:42:26.656]  And the banksters never lose.
[00:42:26.696 --> 00:42:27.957]  They always just get more and more.
[00:42:27.977 --> 00:42:29.598]  They can get away with anything.
[00:42:29.638 --> 00:42:34.421]  And I think this is the classic disaster when these people think they're unstoppable.
[00:42:35.042 --> 00:42:36.883]  And again, I'm not anti-Israel.
[00:42:37.363 --> 00:42:41.767]  It's always the flavor du jour, the cause du jour, the cause celeb.
[00:42:43.289 --> 00:42:44.309]  Nothing's more trendy.
[00:42:44.329 --> 00:42:51.931]  I mean, I even hear pro-Israel people that I've known over the years on radio now bad-mouthing Israel and making little attacks on Israel.
[00:42:52.351 --> 00:43:02.154]  I know Israel's run by corrupt globalists that are the same as every other major nation, is used as a set piece for the globalists to create destabilization everywhere and play different groups off against each other.
[00:43:02.614 --> 00:43:07.158]  It's just like, I'm not against the Saudi Arabian people, but their government is incredibly evil involved in all this.
[00:43:07.238 --> 00:43:11.942]  Or the German people, or the French people have a horrible socialist leadership, but I'm not against them.
[00:43:12.022 --> 00:43:22.271]  Or the people of the UK, I can't stand your monarchy and your corrupt elites and the labor on top of it that acts like they're anti-monarchy to play the part of, you know, left cover for that.
[00:43:22.932 --> 00:43:25.234]  But the people of the UK are wonderful folks.
[00:43:25.294 --> 00:43:26.274]  Same thing for Canadians.
[00:43:27.375 --> 00:43:30.058]  We the people need to come together for truth and justice.
[00:43:31.437 --> 00:43:46.665]  And say no to this because the UN, run by the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers and others on record, that's who paid to set it up, who also helped set up Israel, are creating this dialectic again where they fund all the different sides.
[00:43:47.405 --> 00:43:48.786]  And I know I say this probably about
[00:43:49.654 --> 00:43:51.976]  Three or four times a day because it's so important, folks.
[00:43:52.277 --> 00:44:00.705]  Full spectrum dominance is where the globalists try to fund all the sides and then, out of the crisis, consolidate more power.
[00:44:01.425 --> 00:44:08.292]  And it's so obvious what's happening here and people in Israel should be asking the same question Americans are asking and people in the UK are asking.
[00:44:08.592 --> 00:44:10.274]  And the good news is that's now happening.
[00:44:11.084 --> 00:44:16.290]  You can pull up the articles, you know, does Obama know he's funding Al-Qaeda in Syria?
[00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:22.997]  And Rand Paul and Ron Paul are bringing it up and we're bringing it up at InfoWars.com and DrudgeReport.com is bringing it up.
[00:44:23.057 --> 00:44:27.181]  So, we're forcing an across-the-board major debate
[00:44:28.597 --> 00:44:30.218]  about this, folks.
[00:44:31.439 --> 00:44:37.943]  And so we need to continue, but I really want to see a bigger debate in Israel on this.
[00:44:37.983 --> 00:44:48.450]  In fact, maybe next hour I should open the phones up for people that are in Syria or who are in Israel or who are in Jordan or in Iraq or in Egypt to give us your take on this paradox.
[00:44:49.130 --> 00:44:59.339]  Because it's not really a paradox once you understand the arms makers, the big banks, the security complex that's consolidating the world economy right now needs big wars to bring in world government.
[00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:00.761]  Closing comments, Paul Watson.
[00:45:02.318 --> 00:45:09.685]  Well, I mean, we've got to remember that the people who are going to be dying as a result of these wars, however limited, are going to be civilians.
[00:45:09.725 --> 00:45:10.906]  They're also going to be troops.
[00:45:10.926 --> 00:45:12.468]  They're going to be Syrian troops.
[00:45:12.508 --> 00:45:15.231]  But they've got brothers, sisters, mothers and fathers.
[00:45:15.271 --> 00:45:16.131]  They've got children.
[00:45:16.592 --> 00:45:19.675]  So it's not just about, you know, toppling Assad.
[00:45:19.715 --> 00:45:21.817]  It's about the fact that more people are going to die.
[00:45:22.157 --> 00:45:25.781]  In fact, there was an academic study that came out a couple of days ago that showed
[00:45:26.241 --> 00:45:32.911]  Military interventions on behalf of rebel factions increase civilian deaths by 40%.
[00:45:33.211 --> 00:45:37.798]  And then you've only got to look at what happened in Libya two years ago.
[00:45:37.838 --> 00:45:38.659]  Again, same thing.
[00:45:38.719 --> 00:45:40.121]  Send in the al-Qaeda terrorists.
[00:45:40.141 --> 00:45:40.942]  Topple Gaddafi.
[00:45:41.443 --> 00:45:43.185]  Libya now, their economy has collapsed.
[00:45:43.225 --> 00:45:50.414]  It was a complete hellhole run by jihadist gangs, putting black people in concentration camps, torturing them to death.
[00:45:50.874 --> 00:45:51.895]  This doesn't work.
[00:45:51.975 --> 00:45:54.118]  It's never worked and it's not going to work now.
[00:45:54.158 --> 00:45:55.399]  Because it's not meant to work.
[00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:57.101]  It's meant to wreck things and take them over.
[00:45:57.402 --> 00:45:58.523]  Paul Watson, great job.
[00:45:58.563 --> 00:45:59.885]  We will talk to you soon, my friend.
[00:46:00.401 --> 00:46:00.941]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:46:01.421 --> 00:46:03.001]  Alright, there goes Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:46:03.021 --> 00:46:07.882]  He heads up PrisonPlanet.com and of course we have PrisonPlanet.tv for all the nightly news subscribers.
[00:46:07.902 --> 00:46:08.683]  I want to thank all of you.
[00:46:09.083 --> 00:46:10.523]  Be sure and share your memberships there.
[00:46:11.163 --> 00:46:19.945]  We're going to play a Ron Paul clip here in just a moment where he talks about Syria being a false flag.
[00:46:20.645 --> 00:46:22.285]  Again, we commend Ron Paul for his courage.
[00:46:22.305 --> 00:46:23.985]  I'm going to tell you, the polls are real, folks.
[00:46:24.686 --> 00:46:26.086]  They go with truth and justice.
[00:46:27.145 --> 00:46:29.526]  And that's why I just hope Rand Paul ends up being president.
[00:46:30.207 --> 00:46:35.689]  Because I know him personally, known him for, I said 14 years ago, I thought about it, time flies.
[00:46:35.729 --> 00:46:39.231]  Actually, I've known Rand Paul for 17 years.
[00:46:41.132 --> 00:46:45.274]  Since his father was running for Congress in 1996.
[00:46:47.631 --> 00:46:53.833]  All right, that said, speaking of PrisonPlanet.tv or InfoWarsNews.com, it will also take you there.
[00:46:54.233 --> 00:46:56.594]  It has 18 years of my material up on it.
[00:46:56.614 --> 00:46:58.095]  It's been around almost 11 years.
[00:46:59.595 --> 00:47:02.296]  It has the nightly news live on it.
[00:47:02.316 --> 00:47:03.416]  It has all the archives.
[00:47:03.436 --> 00:47:04.957]  It has the archives of the live show.
[00:47:05.397 --> 00:47:11.619]  It has the higher quality bit rate of the daytime show that we give out for free to everybody at InfoWars.com for its last show.
[00:47:12.619 --> 00:47:15.360]  It has a whole bunch of other documentaries from documentary filmmakers.
[00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:16.541]  We've been authorized to post there.
[00:47:17.739 --> 00:47:22.183]  It has so many other special reports and things that are not on YouTube and everywhere else.
[00:47:22.483 --> 00:47:30.730]  And it's the source, it's the fount, the fountainhead of the hundreds of millions of people a year that do see our stuff on YouTube and other video platforms.
[00:47:30.770 --> 00:47:33.152]  So supporting it is literally
[00:47:34.488 --> 00:47:45.861]  Donating to the very front lines of hardcore resistance and a platform that we have that can't be censored and controlled as easy as the third-party platforms like YouTube and others.
[00:47:46.282 --> 00:47:51.728]  So please, if you're not a PrisonPlanet.tv member, now is the time to go subscribe.
[00:47:52.389 --> 00:47:53.149]  And for $5.95 a month,
[00:47:54.764 --> 00:47:57.605]  You get 11 memberships, the same username and passcode.
[00:47:57.805 --> 00:48:00.847]  Use a username and passcode that's unique to the site when you set it up.
[00:48:01.167 --> 00:48:02.767]  If you don't have that, it's easy to change it.
[00:48:02.787 --> 00:48:03.688]  Go to the site and learn how.
[00:48:04.288 --> 00:48:06.249]  So it's not a passcode to something else, obviously.
[00:48:07.349 --> 00:48:21.755]  And then share the username and passcode with your friends and family so that 11 people can simultaneously log on to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:48:25.129 --> 00:48:31.131]  And it is the subscribers of PrisonPlanet.tv that have let us build the bigger studios, hire the reporters, more writers, all of it.
[00:48:31.211 --> 00:48:32.672]  We're maxed out, so it's important.
[00:48:32.712 --> 00:48:43.036]  If you've not been a member, or you were a member and let it lapse, we absolutely need you to stand side-by-side with us in this fight, and buy your war bonds, support the good guys, support the White Hats.
[00:48:44.332 --> 00:48:45.852]  Go to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:48:45.932 --> 00:48:46.833]  Get a membership today.
[00:48:47.073 --> 00:48:48.213]  And we've upgraded the site.
[00:48:48.253 --> 00:48:49.353]  It works really good now.
[00:48:49.654 --> 00:48:52.014]  It's had some bugs over the years that people stuck with us.
[00:48:52.234 --> 00:48:53.755]  It's always been a force to be reckoned with.
[00:48:54.115 --> 00:48:55.515]  It's getting better and better and better.
[00:48:55.535 --> 00:48:57.036]  We're adding more and more features.
[00:48:57.076 --> 00:49:04.338]  PrisonPlanet.tv and be part of Operation Awaking the Sleeping Giant where you then
[00:49:06.443 --> 00:49:11.044]  On an e-card, share your username, passcode, your membership with friends and family.
[00:49:11.844 --> 00:49:17.205]  And you can probably share it with 30 or 40 people because most folks aren't going to tune in every night when the show's on at 7 o'clock or go in there.
[00:49:17.485 --> 00:49:23.726]  But if you ever go and there's 11 people logged on simultaneously and you're logged out or you can't get on, well, thank God!
[00:49:24.026 --> 00:49:28.367]  That means 11 people are simultaneously watching on your membership.
[00:49:28.667 --> 00:49:29.227]  Go get another $5.95.
[00:49:29.267 --> 00:49:30.708]  Go get another $5.95 a month.
[00:49:32.668 --> 00:49:33.048]  ...membership.
[00:49:33.068 --> 00:49:36.771]  You can also get a year membership and it comes out to a little more than three months free when you do that.
[00:49:36.791 --> 00:49:38.372]  You can also share that membership.
[00:49:38.412 --> 00:49:43.516]  But regardless, go get PrisonPlanet.tv memberships and share them with friends and family.
[00:49:44.451 --> 00:49:46.212]  With your co-workers, with people at church.
[00:49:46.592 --> 00:49:49.975]  Put it on a little card and say, PrisonPlanet.tv, username, passcode.
[00:49:50.415 --> 00:49:51.596]  Hey, this is my membership.
[00:49:51.676 --> 00:49:52.616]  I'm sharing it with you.
[00:49:53.037 --> 00:49:54.157]  Or here's your gift membership.
[00:49:54.598 --> 00:49:55.198]  Try it out.
[00:49:55.278 --> 00:49:56.479]  Go watch these films.
[00:49:56.839 --> 00:49:57.940]  Go see this material.
[00:49:57.960 --> 00:50:03.224]  Because there's so much censorship heating up, folks, on the internet now and shutting stuff down on YouTube and things.
[00:50:03.844 --> 00:50:07.646]  PrisonPlanet.tv becomes more and more important by the day.
[00:50:08.067 --> 00:50:13.971]  It's also important to go to InfoWarsStore.com and to get the hard copy DVDs.
[00:50:14.551 --> 00:50:14.791]  We're good.
[00:50:35.831 --> 00:50:37.732]  Gravity-fed system that I and my family use.
[00:50:37.772 --> 00:50:39.853]  It cuts out the fluoride, the glyphosates, all of it.
[00:50:39.873 --> 00:50:42.814]  We have the Pro-1, one filtration system, all of it.
[00:50:43.315 --> 00:50:49.117]  Infowarstore.com or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[00:50:49.137 --> 00:50:52.619]  And most importantly, pray for our provision in Providence.
[00:50:53.379 --> 00:50:55.342]  Pray for our country and the world and for justice.
[00:50:56.103 --> 00:50:57.625]  And pray for liberty worldwide.
[00:50:58.386 --> 00:51:02.832]  And please spread the word about this broadcast because that's how we really reach more people.
[00:51:02.872 --> 00:51:04.153]  That's the most important mission.
[00:51:04.414 --> 00:51:09.600]  And support our local AM and FM affiliates by becoming sponsors or supporting the sponsors.
[00:51:09.621 --> 00:51:10.422]  Joel Sausen coming up.
[00:51:10.742 --> 00:51:12.243]  I thought about it for years.
[00:51:12.443 --> 00:51:13.964]  Well, the time is now.
[00:51:14.144 --> 00:51:17.385]  You need a secret bunker, and you need it deep and strong.
[00:51:17.606 --> 00:51:21.047]  Atlas Survival Shelters should be your first and only choice.
[00:51:21.287 --> 00:51:28.411]  The experts at Atlas can help you choose a shelter that has all the comforts of your home and is 11 times stronger than square box shelters.
[00:51:28.671 --> 00:51:31.213]  Call Atlas at 1-855-4BUNKERS.
[00:51:31.233 --> 00:51:33.314]  1-855-4BUNKERS.
[00:51:33.634 --> 00:51:35.695]  Or visit IWantThatBunker.com.
[00:51:35.955 --> 00:51:37.336]  Atlas Survival Shelters.
[00:51:37.716 --> 00:51:39.677]  Better prepared than scared.
[00:51:40.234 --> 00:51:41.274]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:51:41.354 --> 00:51:45.676]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:51:45.836 --> 00:51:51.457]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:51:51.557 --> 00:51:53.658]  Gold has outperformed paper investments yet.

[00:53:11.950 --> 00:53:19.561]  Why do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year betting their lives that the disaster won't get them?
[00:53:20.001 --> 00:53:24.668]  Hundreds of you helped eFoodsDirect ship 50,000 donated meals to the Oklahoma victims.
[00:53:24.948 --> 00:53:26.851]  The problem is we can't help everybody.
[00:53:27.091 --> 00:53:33.213]  If every one of us who can will take care of ourselves, we can all pitch in to take care of those who really can't.

[00:54:15.374 --> 00:54:17.316]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:54:17.796 --> 00:54:20.518]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:47.036]  Well, I think getting to the truth of it, and that's what we're not getting to, because when Saddam Hussein used the gases, some of the products were bought from us, and he was still our ally.
[00:54:47.236 --> 00:54:48.458]  So you can't ignore that.
[00:54:48.698 --> 00:54:49.139]  No, I don't.
[00:54:49.339 --> 00:54:50.000]  I think it's a
[00:54:50.060 --> 00:54:50.620]  False flag.
[00:54:50.661 --> 00:54:51.942]  I think really, indeed.
[00:54:52.282 --> 00:54:58.327]  And nobody knows if indeed he was slaughtering people by the thousands, you know, with poison gas.
[00:54:58.367 --> 00:54:59.808]  You know, that's a different story.
[00:54:59.828 --> 00:55:01.030]  But that isn't the case.
[00:55:01.370 --> 00:55:03.912]  Matter of fact, 100,000 deaths are the case.
[00:55:04.152 --> 00:55:09.637]  And it's not, you know, the implication is that Assad committed 100,000 killings.
[00:55:09.977 --> 00:55:11.539]  There are a lot of facts out there.
[00:55:11.579 --> 00:55:14.141]  Why don't we ask, you know, about the Al-Qaeda?
[00:55:14.281 --> 00:55:16.582]  Why are we on the side of the Al-Qaeda right now?
[00:55:16.942 --> 00:55:18.822]  So I think they want the weapons.
[00:55:18.902 --> 00:55:21.203]  The rebels want the weapons.
[00:55:21.243 --> 00:55:23.904]  There's a bunch of people and the Al-Qaeda is part of it.
[00:55:24.264 --> 00:55:25.685]  And this is the test for us.
[00:55:25.705 --> 00:55:27.885]  We're going to play that full clip coming up the next hour.
[00:55:28.345 --> 00:55:29.966]  But there you go.
[00:55:30.286 --> 00:55:36.048]  There is Ron Paul talking about a false flag.
[00:55:37.611 --> 00:55:46.354]  And we're joined for this segment and a little bit of the next as he's about to get on an airplane by the editor of World Affairs Brief, great geopolitical mind, Joel Skousen.
[00:55:46.675 --> 00:55:49.916]  Joel, what is your breakdown on what's really happening?
[00:55:50.216 --> 00:55:52.197]  Do you think there's going to be a limited strike attack?
[00:55:52.217 --> 00:55:52.937]  Will it be bigger?
[00:55:53.217 --> 00:55:54.498]  And what do you think will come out of it?
[00:55:54.558 --> 00:55:55.678]  Or will there not be a strike?
[00:55:56.018 --> 00:55:57.959]  And do you think this is a false flag with the rebels?
[00:55:59.309 --> 00:56:01.675]  Well, it's definitely a false flag with the rebels, Alex.
[00:56:01.735 --> 00:56:04.883]  There is no way that Assad, knowing that the U.S.
[00:56:04.983 --> 00:56:08.452]  is just itching for an excuse to invade or to attack...
[00:56:09.122 --> 00:56:16.184]  Would use a chemical weapon, a homebrew, one single weapon to kill a few people within his own neighborhood.
[00:56:16.765 --> 00:56:22.387]  It's just impossible to think that an intelligent, rational being would just hand the U.S.
[00:56:22.447 --> 00:56:23.067]  an excuse.
[00:56:23.507 --> 00:56:29.909]  This was clearly a homebrew rocket created by the rebels or fed to them by black operations.
[00:56:29.989 --> 00:56:32.730]  You know, there's lots of sources of nerve gas that the U.S.
[00:56:32.770 --> 00:56:33.330]  has around.
[00:56:33.850 --> 00:56:38.412]  They can manufacture, they can make it look like a mixture of many others.
[00:56:39.433 --> 00:56:42.980]  This is a dramatic false flag operation to justify this.
[00:56:43.020 --> 00:56:48.972]  Now, that said, I think it's important to realize that the situation is changing dramatically against
[00:56:49.733 --> 00:57:01.876]  The United States intent, I'm completely convinced they were intending to launch two to three hundred cruise missiles and do a massive strike against this, but public support is waning fast.
[00:57:01.976 --> 00:57:03.216]  Congress is getting upset.
[00:57:03.776 --> 00:57:08.518]  It's great news that the British Parliament just said no to David Cameron, leaving the U.S.
[00:57:08.578 --> 00:57:10.998]  hanging out there alone without U.N.
[00:57:11.038 --> 00:57:11.478]  support.
[00:57:11.518 --> 00:57:13.539]  You know, they're really big as globalists on
[00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:14.861]  Getting U.N.
[00:57:14.901 --> 00:57:15.322]  backing.
[00:57:15.443 --> 00:57:18.210]  All they've got is yes-men and NATO and the U.S.
[00:57:18.410 --> 00:57:18.951]  and the U.S.
[00:57:19.012 --> 00:57:20.515]  people simply aren't buying it.
[00:57:21.807 --> 00:57:31.029]  I have said this whole week, and I want to see if you agree with me, that this shows one of the biggest collapses in the New World Order, Anglo-American establishments, propaganda fronts.
[00:57:31.349 --> 00:57:39.310]  It's been over 150 years, almost 200, since the British Parliament ever voted down a war.
[00:57:39.850 --> 00:57:42.231]  They're calling it absolutely unprecedented.
[00:57:42.251 --> 00:57:50.252]  And I see this really as a route, but it's when the globalists are cornered, as you know, that they tend to then stage something even bigger.
[00:57:51.678 --> 00:57:55.300]  Yeah, this is something they won't take no to.
[00:57:55.560 --> 00:58:02.223]  The only thing that is up in the air right now is whether or not they'll do a limited strike this weekend before the G20 Summit.
[00:58:02.283 --> 00:58:10.847]  They don't want to be in a full war with Vladimir Putin having the bully pulpit there at the GM Summit in Moscow and being able to criticize the U.S.
[00:58:11.447 --> 00:58:17.851]  So they've been downplaying this to look for just maybe a couple of dozen surgical strikes
[00:58:19.051 --> 00:58:23.498]  This weekend, then they would quit for the G2 summit, and then they'd hit it full on later on.
[00:58:23.558 --> 00:58:34.613]  Because you see, if they hit it too hard, Assad thinks that he's being back to the wall, then he's tempted to start to launch his missiles at, you know, in a use-them-or-lose-them type thing with Israel.
[00:58:35.194 --> 00:58:45.216]  I think the propaganda, the diplomatic statement that Kerry put out today, or yesterday, that we're not attempting to overthrow Assad, big lie.
[00:58:46.077 --> 00:58:47.637]  Stay there, stay there.
[00:58:47.697 --> 00:58:48.657]  Kerry's speaking now.
[00:58:48.737 --> 00:58:49.117]  We'll be back.
[00:58:52.898 --> 00:58:56.879]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.

[00:59:10.111 --> 00:59:16.535]  Listen, there is some real scum in the alarm business cashing in by locking you into long, punishing contracts.
[00:59:16.915 --> 00:59:18.876]  Not with SimpliSafe Home Security.

[01:00:05.669 --> 01:00:08.451]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:14.963 --> 01:00:19.145]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:19.785 --> 01:00:20.605]  You want answers?
[01:00:21.386 --> 01:00:23.287]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:23.307 --> 01:00:26.608]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:27.128 --> 01:00:31.170]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:33.516 --> 01:00:41.461]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're watching the State Department's website, and it has Kerry speaking live, they're saying, but CNN says they have a live feed minutes after.
[01:00:41.481 --> 01:00:42.141]  There's no Kerry.
[01:00:42.821 --> 01:00:47.724]  Show the State Department site, and then let's flip over to CNN to show people what we're talking about.
[01:00:47.744 --> 01:00:49.245]  Oh, he finally came out.
[01:00:50.085 --> 01:00:52.587]  That's the State Department site.
[01:00:53.067 --> 01:00:56.409]  Then you flip over to CNN, and it's not there.
[01:00:56.549 --> 01:01:01.452]  So they say Kerry's about to speak, but he just came out like three minutes ago and started speaking.
[01:01:02.614 --> 01:01:04.355]  And then that just shows how delayed it is.
[01:01:04.395 --> 01:01:06.776]  That is bizarre.
[01:01:06.796 --> 01:01:08.576]  Man, I tell you, CNN is so jacked.
[01:01:08.636 --> 01:01:09.957]  I mean, they are so manipulative.
[01:01:10.777 --> 01:01:11.077]  Wow.
[01:01:11.577 --> 01:01:15.159]  We're going to continue here to try to figure out exactly what's happening.
[01:01:15.179 --> 01:01:21.401]  Joel Skousen from World Affairs Brief, the editor over there, military man, a great political mind in my view.
[01:01:21.441 --> 01:01:22.762]  That's why we have him joining us.
[01:01:23.142 --> 01:01:23.702]  I agree with you.
[01:01:23.762 --> 01:01:28.564]  I think they'll probably do some really small thing to save face as they see we did something
[01:01:29.444 --> 01:01:33.745]  And then ramp it up, because that's the drumbeat, we've got to do something, we've got to do something.
[01:01:34.125 --> 01:01:37.346]  Hundreds of thousands are dying, never pointing out the globalists started this.
[01:01:38.246 --> 01:01:47.909]  But the collapse of confidence in them, Brzezinski's back out again this week saying, he said the alternative media is the cause of this and that they're losing control.
[01:01:48.249 --> 01:01:50.530]  He's hitting the panic button to the CFR.
[01:01:50.830 --> 01:01:51.770]  What does that signify?
[01:01:53.345 --> 01:01:58.630]  Well, they're going to have to manage this because the wave of opposition is growing.
[01:01:59.931 --> 01:02:06.397]  That's why they're going to have to come out with some manufactured false information to justify this, to get the people back on board.
[01:02:06.417 --> 01:02:08.519]  The longer they delay, the worse it's going to be.
[01:02:09.239 --> 01:02:12.323]  Before I get on this plane, let me just get in this very important point, though.
[01:02:12.423 --> 01:02:13.725]  I think Glenn Beck is wrong.
[01:02:13.745 --> 01:02:16.228]  This is not going to run into World War III.
[01:02:16.668 --> 01:02:18.230]  Russia's giving every sign.
[01:02:18.610 --> 01:02:21.794]  Lavrov said, we are not going to attack anyone.
[01:02:21.934 --> 01:02:23.096]  Meaning, we're not going to war.
[01:02:23.156 --> 01:02:24.417]  Green light to the U.S.
[01:02:24.437 --> 01:02:25.479]  to kick Assad out.
[01:02:26.139 --> 01:02:33.723]  They're posturing, appearing to, you know, make a play, but if they wanted to stop the U.S.
[01:02:33.743 --> 01:02:40.207]  from going in or Israel, they'd just have to simply put two fighter squadrons into the Syrian air bases and they wouldn't touch them.
[01:02:41.022 --> 01:02:45.425]  And they're not doing that, shows Russia's not serious about defending Syria.
[01:02:46.785 --> 01:02:48.626]  Russia and China are not ready to go to war.
[01:02:48.646 --> 01:02:54.590]  This may well, and very probably will turn into the big Middle East war that I've been predicting.
[01:02:55.030 --> 01:02:59.593]  Because if Assad is forced to retaliate with everything he's got, Iran will join him.
[01:03:00.053 --> 01:03:01.874]  Then Israel gets, and the U.S.
[01:03:01.894 --> 01:03:07.577]  gets to attack Iran without having to provoke it with a first strike, as Israel was planning to do.
[01:03:07.697 --> 01:03:10.582]  But you said they've always been trying to sucker them into this.
[01:03:10.923 --> 01:03:15.510]  But how can they morally attack countries and then they defend themselves and sell water wars?
[01:03:15.931 --> 01:03:21.100]  I guess this is just a total position where America becomes the bad guy.
[01:03:22.110 --> 01:03:24.091]  This is a total propaganda blitz.
[01:03:24.311 --> 01:03:27.273]  I was cringing when I listened to NPR yesterday.
[01:03:27.353 --> 01:03:29.514]  Mara Weissman just lied through her teeth.
[01:03:29.934 --> 01:03:32.095]  Said Obama's got himself into a box.
[01:03:33.276 --> 01:03:34.957]  He's put a red line down.
[01:03:34.977 --> 01:03:41.320]  He let Syria attack with chemical weapons earlier this year, and he did it again.
[01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:43.141]  I mean, she lied both times.
[01:03:43.181 --> 01:03:47.183]  The UN has cleared Syria on the first attack and said it was the rebels.
[01:03:47.263 --> 01:03:50.685]  I mean, to do a bald-faced lie like that is just incredible.
[01:03:52.259 --> 01:03:52.839]  Amazing.
[01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:55.381]  We've only got a minute left, Joe, I'll let you get on that plane.
[01:03:55.401 --> 01:03:59.144]  If there is a limited strike, when do you expect it to take place?
[01:03:59.244 --> 01:04:00.725]  Saturday or Sunday after the U.N.?
[01:04:01.145 --> 01:04:02.106]  Inspectors are pulled?
[01:04:02.987 --> 01:04:10.812]  Well, you know, even that is a little bit chancy now because of the fact that everybody's demanding in Congress that you wait for the U.N.
[01:04:10.832 --> 01:04:12.914]  Obama may be forced to wait.
[01:04:13.747 --> 01:04:21.093]  And so I would give it only a 50-50 chance, but if it's going to happen, it's going to happen probably Sunday or Monday.
[01:04:21.514 --> 01:04:22.414]  Try to clear out.
[01:04:22.535 --> 01:04:27.098]  Could go into Tuesday if they want it over with for the Wednesday summit start.
[01:04:28.379 --> 01:04:30.121]  Joel Scowls in World Affairs Brief.
[01:04:30.161 --> 01:04:32.463]  Thank you so much for spending time with us.
[01:04:32.643 --> 01:04:40.510]  In closing, does this signal a major reversal, though, of the globalist element of the New World Order?
[01:04:41.562 --> 01:04:43.323]  No, just something that they've got to manage.
[01:04:43.643 --> 01:04:44.444]  Not a reversal.
[01:04:44.544 --> 01:04:45.605]  They're really powerful.
[01:04:46.865 --> 01:04:48.486]  OK, so it's something they've got to manage.
[01:04:48.566 --> 01:04:50.648]  All right, we'll talk to you very soon.
[01:04:50.688 --> 01:04:51.248]  Thank you, Joel.
[01:04:51.728 --> 01:04:52.509]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:04:52.969 --> 01:04:55.651]  All right, we'll be back, ladies and gentlemen, with a ton of news.
[01:04:55.731 --> 01:04:56.592]  Your phone calls.
[01:04:56.772 --> 01:05:03.516]  Ron Paul has come out and says he thinks the Syrian attack with the nerve gas is a false flag and more.
[01:05:03.836 --> 01:05:07.959]  Straight ahead, we are the true free press broadcasting worldwide.
[01:05:10.856 --> 01:05:12.919]  It's hurricane and wildfire season again.
[01:05:12.939 --> 01:05:20.569]  Why do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year, betting their lives that the disaster won't get them?
[01:05:20.989 --> 01:05:25.655]  Hundreds of you helped eFoodsDirect ship 50,000 donated meals to the Oklahoma victims.
[01:05:25.915 --> 01:05:27.818]  The problem is we can't help everybody.
[01:05:28.078 --> 01:05:34.200]  If every one of us who can will take care of ourselves, we can all pitch in to take care of those who really can't.
[01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:42.303]  The new Just In Case Pack from eFoods Direct is the big brother to the 7-Day Emergency Pack designed for Oklahoma disaster donations.
[01:05:42.703 --> 01:05:49.025]  It contains a 2-month supply for 1 person, or a 1-month supply for 2 adults, or a 2-week supply for a family of 4.
[01:05:49.665 --> 01:05:50.926]  The $320 price is $50 less than retail.

[01:07:10.310 --> 01:07:17.633]  Dozens of diseases ranging from the common cold and flu to MRSA and pneumonia are all caused by infectious pathogens.
[01:07:18.074 --> 01:07:21.875]  Fortunately, a simple, safe and effective alternative exists.

[01:08:15.063 --> 01:08:28.850]  Ladies and gentlemen, one big sign that you're living in an authoritarian country is if you have government involved in domestic propaganda, government involved funding, private media,
[01:08:46.089 --> 01:08:49.151]  And private media basically becomes covert state-run media.
[01:08:50.251 --> 01:08:59.497]  Just having state-run media is a really bad sign, but when it's covert state-run media, where there's supposedly groups that are independent but they're not, you know you're in trouble.
[01:09:00.137 --> 01:09:12.744]  And CNN, because I've been there multiple times over the years, in different parts of the country, but mainly in New York, and other cable networks, are moving towards having nothing live, basically.
[01:09:15.592 --> 01:09:31.239]  More than 10 minutes before Kerry went out on CNN, and we have both the feeds, more than 10 minutes before they were saying live, they had live on the screen, showing the reporter sitting there, waiting for him to come out and speak at the State Department.
[01:09:31.519 --> 01:09:35.240]  He was on the State Department website streaming live.
[01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:37.541]  It said live, and I said, this must be a mistake.
[01:09:38.142 --> 01:09:41.103]  Same blue tie, same speech, we have it.
[01:09:41.363 --> 01:09:43.604]  Let's go to the feed of him 10 minutes
[01:09:44.699 --> 01:09:45.079]  Separate.
[01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:58.432]  So if you're watching on TV right now, we have Kerry up in the left-hand top corner at the State Department feed, and then you have him on CNN ten minutes separate.
[01:09:58.452 --> 01:10:01.876]  Can we fade them both up with both feeds so they can hear him talking over himself?
[01:10:02.136 --> 01:10:02.877]  Not a scratch.
[01:10:03.812 --> 01:10:08.536]  Not a shrapnel wound, not a cut, not a gunshot wound.
[01:10:08.776 --> 01:10:13.440]  We saw rows of dead lined up in burial shrouds.
[01:10:13.540 --> 01:10:17.383]  The white linen unstained by a single drop of blood.
[01:10:17.583 --> 01:10:18.403]  This is State Department.
[01:10:18.423 --> 01:10:25.049]  Instead of being tucked safely in their beds at home, we are the United States of America.
[01:10:26.072 --> 01:10:37.896]  We are the country that has tried, not always successfully, but always successfully to massage gas and surrounded by parents and grandparents who had suffered the same fate.
[01:10:38.837 --> 01:10:46.960]  The United States government now knows that at least 1,429 Syrians were killed in this attack, including at least 426 children.
[01:10:54.227 --> 01:10:58.650]  Even the first responders, the doctors, nurses and medics have tried to save them.
[01:10:58.670 --> 01:11:02.493]  Alright, fade that down for a minute.
[01:11:02.713 --> 01:11:04.855]  So, John Kerry is 10 minutes separated.
[01:11:05.396 --> 01:11:07.297]  Not 30 seconds or a minute or whatever.
[01:11:08.038 --> 01:11:09.218]  Not the internet lagging.
[01:11:09.238 --> 01:11:11.020]  You would think the internet would be behind.
[01:11:12.648 --> 01:11:13.548]  Okay, no.
[01:11:13.608 --> 01:11:15.089]  This is 10 minute separation.
[01:11:15.209 --> 01:11:20.051]  That's what they're doing now to make sure nothing goes out that they don't want out.
[01:11:20.652 --> 01:11:30.736]  Showing that there's actually concern in the power structure that Kerry may say something they don't want put out there and that there's different competing factions.
[01:11:31.156 --> 01:11:35.038]  And I was told that by insiders earlier in the week.
[01:11:37.729 --> 01:11:44.275]  And it was Dr. Corsi that also on the show talked about seeing his speech and that it appeared he'd had his wings clipped.
[01:11:44.655 --> 01:11:57.546]  And Corsi has amazing sources, so I'm telling you, when they delay the Secretary of State, because in media you want to have the feed live, the first feed, they always carry cabinet head speeches live, the president's speech is live.
[01:11:57.886 --> 01:12:01.369]  To have him delayed ten minutes on CNN is un-believable.
[01:12:02.090 --> 01:12:03.050]  Unbelievable!
[01:12:03.430 --> 01:12:04.771]  And something is going on here.
[01:12:05.031 --> 01:12:15.275]  And by the way, I have seen myself, live, multiple times, but I've seen the tapes of it on YouTube many times, where on C-SPAN, if someone goes, I'm bringing up classified info!
[01:12:15.575 --> 01:12:29.620]  The FEMA camp's... Well, you know there's three trillion missing from the Pentagon, and we've been told not to... It'll literally... They will cut the feed, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:12:31.161 --> 01:12:36.745]  That's why they have the EAS alert system, which they now admit controls all radio, all TV, all internet.
[01:12:37.025 --> 01:12:42.628]  They're forcing Obama text onto my dad's cell phone, onto my cell phone, into my dad's email.
[01:12:43.029 --> 01:12:44.009]  He didn't sign up for it.
[01:12:46.411 --> 01:12:50.013]  Local governments doing it, scaring people, turning their phones on at 3 a.m.
[01:12:50.033 --> 01:12:50.473]  in L.A.
[01:12:50.493 --> 01:12:51.234]  to give them alerts.
[01:12:51.834 --> 01:12:54.336]  This is the Big Brother control system.
[01:12:55.811 --> 01:12:58.992]  And I've got my reporters over there writing notes on what he's saying.
[01:12:59.032 --> 01:13:00.293]  A transcript will be out soon.
[01:13:00.313 --> 01:13:03.675]  But basically, they're getting ready to bring out another fake dossier.
[01:13:03.995 --> 01:13:04.935]  That's what they're publishing.
[01:13:05.175 --> 01:13:09.877]  With the exact number of dead, all their cooked up witnesses to say what happened.
[01:13:09.917 --> 01:13:13.699]  And it looks like they may go ahead with a limited bombardment.
[01:13:13.919 --> 01:13:41.998]  That's what it's leaning towards, with cruise missiles of Assad, as a political diversion from NSA gate, IRS gate, persecution of the Tea Party gate, persecution of the pro-life group gate, telling them what to pray and they can't protest for babies, that's mainstream news, Fast and Furious, Benghazi, all the Solyndra energy scams, all the incredible corruption, the White House trying to start race wars, all these scandals, his imploding approval ratings,
[01:13:42.398 --> 01:13:46.320]  The fact that Obama shipped the jobs to China using taxpayer money to pay for it.
[01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:48.241]  The fact they're shutting down our power plants.
[01:13:48.501 --> 01:13:51.763]  The fact that Obamacare raises taxes on people.
[01:13:52.283 --> 01:13:54.924]  It was $30,000 or more, now it's $20,000 or more.
[01:13:54.964 --> 01:13:59.887]  And increases the prices, doubling, and on and on and on.
[01:14:00.947 --> 01:14:02.608]  They need this political diversion.
[01:14:04.169 --> 01:14:06.070]  And we've got the Secretary
[01:14:07.173 --> 01:14:07.834]  of state here.
[01:14:07.874 --> 01:14:11.016]  You know, fade him up and I'll talk over him with his baloney pieces.
[01:14:11.616 --> 01:14:17.861]  Let's go to the State Department piece where he's... Just longing for peace does not necessarily bring it about.
[01:14:18.882 --> 01:14:34.032]  And history would judge us all extraordinarily harshly if we turned a blind eye to a dictator's wanton use of weapons of mass destruction against all warnings, against all common understanding of decency.
[01:14:34.986 --> 01:14:36.888]  These things we do know.
[01:14:38.250 --> 01:14:43.316]  We also know that we have a president who does what he says that he will do.
[01:14:44.157 --> 01:14:44.577]  Oh, really?
[01:14:44.658 --> 01:14:47.961]  And he has said very clearly that whatever decision he makes in Syria...
[01:14:48.894 --> 01:14:53.958]  It will bear no resemblance to Afghanistan, Iraq, or even Libya.
[01:14:54.378 --> 01:14:54.978]  That means it will.
[01:14:54.998 --> 01:14:57.500]  It will not involve any boots on the ground.
[01:14:57.520 --> 01:14:58.341]  All he does is lie.
[01:14:58.501 --> 01:15:06.266]  It will not be open-ended, and it will not assume responsibility for a civil war that is already well underway.
[01:15:06.286 --> 01:15:08.047]  There's already commandos in the country for two years.
[01:15:08.067 --> 01:15:09.488]  The President has been clear.
[01:15:10.269 --> 01:15:14.272]  Any action that he might decide to take will be limited in tailored response
[01:15:15.272 --> 01:15:16.173]  Turn it down for a minute.
[01:15:16.713 --> 01:15:22.795]  The reason they faded it up is right before he said that, he said, you know, the UN can't galvanize action.
[01:15:23.116 --> 01:15:24.216]  Obama will have to.
[01:15:25.036 --> 01:15:33.420]  So, again, when the UN won't do what they want because of the Russia-China vetoes, then they flip back and say, well, we'll do it.
[01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:35.601]  And then Congress says, no, you've got to come to us to do it.
[01:15:35.921 --> 01:15:37.162]  And they say, well, we don't need you either.
[01:15:37.927 --> 01:15:40.109]  I mean, why do we need anything then if we have Obama?
[01:15:40.129 --> 01:15:42.231]  I mean, he can just, he can just make all the decisions.
[01:15:42.251 --> 01:15:42.991]  That's what I'm telling you.
[01:15:43.372 --> 01:15:48.676]  This transformation is about the executive, not even Obama, but the executive becoming a dictatorship.
[01:15:49.016 --> 01:15:50.378]  Becoming dictatorial.
[01:15:50.678 --> 01:15:51.799]  That's what dictatorship means.
[01:15:51.939 --> 01:15:54.701]  They do what they want without checks and balances.
[01:15:55.462 --> 01:15:57.063]  Now, let's go back to ten minutes earlier.
[01:15:57.103 --> 01:16:00.726]  Let's go back to CNN, where they're ten minutes earlier because they're delaying it.
[01:16:00.746 --> 01:16:01.087]  Here it is.
[01:16:01.627 --> 01:16:08.671]  We're a thug and a murderer, like Bashar al-Assad, can gas thousands of his own people with impunity.
[01:16:10.212 --> 01:16:25.601]  Even after the United States and our allies said no, and then the world does nothing about it, there will be no end to the test of our resolve and the dangers that will flow from those others who believe that they can do as they will.
[01:16:27.165 --> 01:16:29.548]  This matter is also beyond the limits of serious borders.
[01:16:39.673 --> 01:16:42.955]  Look, the State Department video just closed, and now let's time it.
[01:16:42.995 --> 01:16:50.579]  Let's time it from 12, from 12-16, it's 35 now, but it was about 12-16-20 when the doors closed.
[01:16:50.599 --> 01:16:56.022]  12-16-20, let's go back to CNN now and see how long they had it delayed.
[01:16:56.442 --> 01:16:57.423]  Let's go back to CNN.
[01:16:58.183 --> 01:17:02.366]  Was stopped from those weapons current or future use?
[01:17:03.366 --> 01:17:08.189]  Or will they remember that the world stood aside and created impunity?
[01:17:09.540 --> 01:17:14.101]  So our concern is not just about some far off land.
[01:17:14.141 --> 01:17:14.501]  Hitler?
[01:17:15.521 --> 01:17:16.221]  Oceans away.
[01:17:16.241 --> 01:17:17.262]  This is Hitler type stuff.
[01:17:17.282 --> 01:17:18.402]  That's not what this is about.
[01:17:19.722 --> 01:17:26.603]  Our concern with the cause of the defenseless people of Syria is about choices that will directly affect our world and our interests in the world.
[01:17:26.623 --> 01:17:27.884]  In Danzig, in Poland, about who we are.
[01:17:36.158 --> 01:17:38.220]  We are the United States of America.
[01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:40.582]  No we're not, we're globalists running the world order command base.
[01:17:40.622 --> 01:17:52.533]  We are the country that has tried, not only successfully, but always tried, to honor a set of universal values around which we have organized our lives and our aspirations.
[01:17:52.573 --> 01:17:54.855]  This crime against conscience, this crime against humanity,
[01:17:59.383 --> 01:18:03.085]  This crime against the most fundamental principles of international community.
[01:18:03.185 --> 01:18:05.886]  You're committing a crime against the moral reality.
[01:18:06.646 --> 01:18:07.987]  This matters to us.
[01:18:08.967 --> 01:18:10.208]  And it matters to who we are.
[01:18:10.228 --> 01:18:10.568]  It matters to you.
[01:18:10.588 --> 01:18:11.708]  You've got the moral high ground.
[01:18:11.728 --> 01:18:13.609]  It matters to who we are.
[01:18:13.689 --> 01:18:14.310]  We've got to do this.
[01:18:14.330 --> 01:18:15.190]  And to our credibility in the world.
[01:18:15.210 --> 01:18:17.331]  We had to put Al Qaeda in there two and a half years ago.
[01:18:17.811 --> 01:18:18.631]  We had to do this.
[01:18:18.671 --> 01:18:19.352]  We're the good guys.
[01:18:19.372 --> 01:18:21.613]  My friends, it matters here if nothing is done.
[01:18:22.668 --> 01:18:25.010]  It matters if the world... Oh, that's enough fading down.
[01:18:25.610 --> 01:18:26.051]  Well, wait a minute.
[01:18:26.071 --> 01:18:27.132]  He has done something.
[01:18:27.172 --> 01:18:45.166]  Two and a half years, they've injected Al-Qaeda, they've killed hundreds of thousands of people, they've funded Al-Qaeda and the Muslim Brotherhood to attack in Libya, and now in Egypt, to blow up all the churches, and we're fundamentally letting you get away with this, and we're sick of it, New World Order, and we know you're the prime suspect, Kerry.
[01:18:45.706 --> 01:18:47.728]  The State Department's running the rebels, that's come out.
[01:18:48.328 --> 01:18:51.170]  Just like they ran Benghazi because the Congress hasn't approved it.
[01:18:51.470 --> 01:18:52.270]  That's who's running it.
[01:18:52.670 --> 01:18:52.971]  Okay?
[01:18:53.211 --> 01:18:54.351]  And so he's the prime suspect.
[01:18:54.391 --> 01:18:57.033]  Let me show you a couple articles that are up on InfoWars.com.
[01:18:57.473 --> 01:19:00.615]  Rebels admit responsibility for chemical weapons attack.
[01:19:00.675 --> 01:19:04.217]  Associated Press award-winning journalist says on record.
[01:19:05.322 --> 01:19:09.564]  Militants tell AP reporter they mishandled Saudi-supplied chemical weapons causing accident.
[01:19:09.844 --> 01:19:10.164]  Boom!
[01:19:10.945 --> 01:19:19.349]  WorldNet Daily reports that they have the video of the Al-Qaeda, shang their Al-Qaeda, loading the mortars, and they uploaded it the day it happened.
[01:19:19.369 --> 01:19:21.230]  They're very proud of themselves.
[01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:26.592]  And we've got Ron Paul up on InfoWars.com right now.
[01:19:27.392 --> 01:19:30.654]  Ron Paul up on InfoWars.com via StoryLink.com.
[01:19:30.674 --> 01:19:31.394]  That's a great site.
[01:19:31.414 --> 01:19:32.195]  Check that out, folks.
[01:19:33.015 --> 01:19:37.178]  Ron Paul's Syria chemical attack, a false flag.
[01:19:38.359 --> 01:19:38.880]  Boom!
[01:19:38.900 --> 01:19:41.522]  And when we come back, Kerry will still be speaking.
[01:19:42.302 --> 01:19:43.643]  CNN says live, by the way.
[01:19:43.884 --> 01:19:45.465]  CNN says live to their people!
[01:19:46.486 --> 01:19:49.148]  And we estimate it's ten minutes behind, but we'll see.
[01:19:49.728 --> 01:19:50.188]  We'll see.
[01:19:50.208 --> 01:19:54.712]  I mean, talk about the man behind the curtain.
[01:19:55.593 --> 01:20:00.957]  And that's our intel, is that there's a big fight going on in the government, and the Pentagon doesn't want to do this.
[01:20:02.125 --> 01:20:04.727]  And the State Department's gone rogue, so CNN's all freaked out.
[01:20:04.747 --> 01:20:06.188]  They're mainly kind of Pentagon-run.
[01:20:06.568 --> 01:20:09.210]  And they don't want something to go out that it isn't supposed to.
[01:20:09.230 --> 01:20:09.951]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:10.471 --> 01:20:14.594]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[01:20:15.255 --> 01:20:18.197]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:20:18.277 --> 01:20:26.603]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.

[01:21:19.720 --> 01:21:26.103]  Listen, there is some real scum in the alarm business cashing in by locking you into long, punishing contracts.
[01:21:26.523 --> 01:21:28.465]  Not with SimpliSafe Home Security.
[01:21:28.805 --> 01:21:29.846]  They're the good guys.

[01:22:10.942 --> 01:22:13.804]  Ceramic Body Armor is rated to stop six hits.
[01:22:14.085 --> 01:22:15.225]  But what about the seventh?
[01:22:15.466 --> 01:22:19.509]  Unlike Ceramic or Kevlar, Infidel Body Armor is proven to take hit after hit.
[01:22:19.729 --> 01:22:21.050]  And it just won't quit.
[01:22:21.270 --> 01:22:23.932]  Reasonably priced and designed for the smart civilian prefer.
[01:22:24.112 --> 01:22:27.775]  Infidel stops hundreds of hits from small arms to high-powered rifles.

[01:22:36.562 --> 01:22:38.864]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[01:22:39.212 --> 01:22:48.459]  We the people grow cotton, wheat fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[01:22:48.519 --> 01:22:49.260]  This capitalism?
[01:22:49.300 --> 01:22:55.424]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:22:55.485 --> 01:22:59.107]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[01:22:59.167 --> 01:23:00.108]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[01:23:00.128 --> 01:23:01.449]  It's time to understand the system.

[01:23:01.829 --> 01:23:02.110]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:23:09.335 --> 01:23:12.816]  For over five years, you've been hearing about the Berkey guy.
[01:23:13.136 --> 01:23:14.957]  So you may know a few things about him.
[01:23:15.237 --> 01:23:21.479]  For example, you are well aware of the superior quality and effectiveness of Berkey water filters and accessories.
[01:23:21.919 --> 01:23:27.161]  But did you know the Berkeys have had independent lab tests done to prove just how effective they are?
[01:23:27.501 --> 01:23:30.042]  It's true, and he can email you the test results.
[01:23:30.382 --> 01:23:32.304]  Just visit GoBerky.com.
[01:23:32.544 --> 01:23:37.450]  You may also know that the Berky Guy has helped tens of thousands of people get better prepared.
[01:23:37.690 --> 01:23:39.232]  Now here's something you may not know.

[01:23:57.022 --> 01:23:57.743]  Again, that's 877-886-3653.
[01:23:57.763 --> 01:23:59.483]  GoBerkey.com, home of the Berkey Guy.
[01:24:14.537 --> 01:24:16.500]  You know, I thought I was living in the twilight zone.
[01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:22.968]  One of the guys had rewound the DVR like 10 minutes to show a clip where they were saying there had been new chemical attacks and that's why it was super delayed.
[01:24:23.309 --> 01:24:25.412]  It was still delayed a couple minutes, which is weird.
[01:24:25.872 --> 01:24:27.955]  So it wasn't completely live, but it wasn't 10 minutes.
[01:24:28.396 --> 01:24:29.076]  Shepard from it.
[01:24:29.537 --> 01:24:34.359]  But Chris Jordan was writing down notes, as my other reporters were, while I was talking over Kerry.
[01:24:35.220 --> 01:24:38.141]  And I've got my reporters in there with a transcript now doing stories on it.
[01:24:38.181 --> 01:24:40.142]  But there's all sorts of contradictions.
[01:24:40.582 --> 01:24:43.803]  Doctors Without Borders on their site is saying 300-something dead.
[01:24:44.344 --> 01:24:46.885]  Kerry is saying 1,400, close to 1,400.
[01:24:46.945 --> 01:24:49.326]  So we're going to get a story out on that.
[01:24:49.386 --> 01:24:52.447]  But Chris, you had some interesting points.
[01:24:52.988 --> 01:24:54.888]  You wrote down some of the things he said.
[01:24:54.928 --> 01:24:55.769]  Tell folks about that.
[01:24:56.149 --> 01:24:57.610]  Well, a couple of the things that he said.
[01:24:57.650 --> 01:24:59.772]  The main one was that the U.N.
[01:24:59.852 --> 01:25:08.639]  cannot bring the world to act as it should in a situation like this, so we need to act regardless of what the U.N.
[01:25:08.679 --> 01:25:08.979]  says.
[01:25:09.199 --> 01:25:12.922]  It also said, rather, Kerry also said... No, it said!
[01:25:12.942 --> 01:25:14.143]  You're right, that's proper English.
[01:25:14.484 --> 01:25:17.766]  It said, like you're speaking of Rachel Maddow.
[01:25:18.207 --> 01:25:19.748]  It said that the U.N.
[01:25:19.848 --> 01:25:23.311]  cannot give us any information that we do not already know.
[01:25:23.971 --> 01:25:31.814]  Even though he, again, verified the fact that we still don't know who used the chemical weapons, that we have no positive... What else did it say?
[01:25:32.375 --> 01:25:33.555]  Uh, that the U.S.
[01:25:33.675 --> 01:25:37.557]  makes its own decisions on its own time, regardless of what the U.N.
[01:25:37.617 --> 01:25:37.857]  says.
[01:25:39.773 --> 01:25:41.194]  Well, simply amazing.
[01:25:41.375 --> 01:25:46.019]  And what do you guys make of Ron Paul coming out and saying he thinks this is a false flag over there?
[01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:50.504]  And then an AP reporter saying, I talked to a bunch of the rebels, they admit they're the ones doing it.
[01:25:50.724 --> 01:25:58.292]  World Net Daily three days ago, video of the rebels, Allah, Allah, Allah, you know, bin Laden, we love you, firing at death to Assad.
[01:25:58.632 --> 01:25:59.613]  I mean, this is insane.
[01:25:59.654 --> 01:26:01.576]  And now Kerry in two different speeches this week.
[01:26:02.572 --> 01:26:04.253]  Says, well, we don't know who did it.
[01:26:04.733 --> 01:26:08.856]  But then today, just in the parts I saw, he goes, we know Assad did it, he's bad.
[01:26:09.116 --> 01:26:11.818]  But then later he says, we don't know who did it.
[01:26:12.318 --> 01:26:13.679]  And that it's inconsequential.
[01:26:14.199 --> 01:26:15.260]  And it's inconsequential.
[01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:16.060]  Well, thank you for that.
[01:26:16.841 --> 01:26:21.243]  It's like Rumsfeld with all of his doublespeak, but even worse.
[01:26:24.025 --> 01:26:28.188]  We know there are known unknowns knowns, but we do not know those unknowns.
[01:26:28.728 --> 01:26:31.730]  However, he would tongue twister the whole deal.
[01:26:33.206 --> 01:26:35.068]  Let's go ahead and go to this Ron Paul clip.
[01:26:35.088 --> 01:26:37.430]  This is up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:26:37.790 --> 01:26:40.272]  Ron Paul, spherical chemical attack, a false flag.
[01:26:40.292 --> 01:26:42.153]  This is a very important story.
[01:26:42.474 --> 01:26:47.558]  Please retweet this, put it on your Facebook, get it out to people, because the world is waking up to this.
[01:26:47.578 --> 01:26:50.620]  The British Parliament, it's been over 200 years.
[01:26:50.680 --> 01:27:01.730]  It was 1787, I think, is what Watson said on air, since the last time the British Parliament voted down a Prime Minister's request for war authorization.
[01:27:02.725 --> 01:27:05.366]  But now he's saying, well I don't need that then, we may still strike.
[01:27:05.606 --> 01:27:13.350]  And the French, I meant to ask Skousen this when he was on, Joel Skousen, why are the French warmongering like this?
[01:27:15.210 --> 01:27:15.691]  Why?
[01:27:16.751 --> 01:27:26.515]  I guess their communist leader who's been caught with, you know, Swiss bank accounts and stuff, with 100% taxes on the middle class, 100% those are the socialists.
[01:27:26.615 --> 01:27:27.516]  Because they're all exempt.
[01:27:27.776 --> 01:27:31.818]  They're all a bunch of bureaucratic pigs, and now they want
[01:27:32.728 --> 01:27:35.711]  To launch a war of humanitarian action.
[01:27:35.911 --> 01:27:37.372]  Why don't we give them all peace prizes?
[01:27:37.592 --> 01:27:40.735]  Let's give the Al-Qaeda forces peace prizes that are burning down churches.
[01:27:41.215 --> 01:27:42.356]  I shouldn't joke about it.
[01:27:42.396 --> 01:27:43.217]  They probably will.
[01:27:44.438 --> 01:27:48.962]  Why don't they put the Nobel Peace Prize symbol on the bombs, on the cruise missiles?
[01:27:49.742 --> 01:27:51.204]  Because this is, you know, war is peace.
[01:27:51.464 --> 01:27:52.184]  Kerry even said that.
[01:27:52.204 --> 01:27:54.847]  He said, you know, sometimes we just can't hope for peace.
[01:27:55.167 --> 01:27:56.448]  We've got to do this for peace.
[01:27:57.249 --> 01:27:58.470]  That is war is peace. 1984.
[01:28:01.238 --> 01:28:01.799]  Unbelievable.
[01:28:01.839 --> 01:28:04.741]  Let's go to Ron Paul talking about false flags.
[01:28:06.242 --> 01:28:18.112]  Well, I think getting to the truth of it, and that's what we're not getting to, because when Saddam Hussein used the gases, some of the products were bought from us and he was still our ally.
[01:28:18.313 --> 01:28:19.514]  So you can't ignore that.
[01:28:19.774 --> 01:28:20.214]  No, I don't.
[01:28:20.434 --> 01:28:21.075]  I think it's a
[01:28:21.135 --> 01:28:21.695]  False flag.
[01:28:21.755 --> 01:28:23.016]  I think really indeed.
[01:28:23.357 --> 01:28:29.401]  And nobody knows if indeed he was slaughtering people by the thousands, you know, with poison gas.
[01:28:29.441 --> 01:28:30.882]  You know, that's a different story.
[01:28:30.922 --> 01:28:32.103]  But that isn't the case.
[01:28:32.443 --> 01:28:34.965]  Matter of fact, 100,000 deaths are the case.
[01:28:35.225 --> 01:28:40.709]  And it's not, you know, the implication is that Assad committed 100,000 killings.
[01:28:41.030 --> 01:28:42.611]  There are a lot of facts out there.
[01:28:42.651 --> 01:28:45.273]  Why don't we ask, you know, about the Al-Qaeda?
[01:28:45.373 --> 01:28:47.554]  Why are we on the side of the Al-Qaeda right now?
[01:28:47.594 --> 01:28:48.135]  God, I love that man.
[01:28:48.735 --> 01:28:50.477]  God, I love that man.
[01:28:50.817 --> 01:28:52.279]  The rebels want the weapons.
[01:28:52.319 --> 01:28:53.880]  There's a bunch of people in there.
[01:28:53.900 --> 01:28:54.961]  Al Qaeda is part of it.
[01:28:56.043 --> 01:28:57.284]  Al Qaeda is 60% of it.
[01:28:57.664 --> 01:29:00.988]  And by the way, conservatively, in fact, they're even more now.
[01:29:02.941 --> 01:29:04.582]  Ron Paul is always conservative.
[01:29:04.902 --> 01:29:09.104]  The 100,000 number is over a year old, last time I checked.
[01:29:10.024 --> 01:29:12.385]  I think some estimates are approaching 200,000 dead.
[01:29:12.986 --> 01:29:19.429]  And most estimates, they've got studies, we had some of them on the air a few days ago, that are being put out by independent groups.
[01:29:20.389 --> 01:29:23.010]  That most of it is the Al-Qaeda forces doing it.
[01:29:23.030 --> 01:29:26.592]  I mean, the army is fighting jihadis pouring in from all sides.
[01:29:26.932 --> 01:29:28.073]  They've been backing them off.
[01:29:28.773 --> 01:29:31.234]  And then Obama goes, if there's nerve gas, I'll attack.
[01:29:31.635 --> 01:29:33.375]  And then all these nerve gas attacks start.
[01:29:33.876 --> 01:29:37.077]  And then the jihadis are so arrogant, they shoot the video of themselves doing it.
[01:29:37.457 --> 01:29:40.019]  I want to get your take on this if you're in the Middle East.
[01:29:40.619 --> 01:29:42.700]  So I'm going to get the general phone number.
[01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:44.161]  I should have it in here, but...
[01:29:45.541 --> 01:29:50.543]  I'm going to give you the Genesis General phone number to call from overseas, because sometimes you can't call a toll-free number from overseas.
[01:29:50.583 --> 01:29:52.224]  And I'll give out the toll-free number as well.
[01:29:52.524 --> 01:29:59.246]  If you live in Israel, if you live in Egypt, if you live especially in Syria, surrounding areas, what's your take on it?
[01:29:59.566 --> 01:30:00.447]  We're on the march.
[01:30:00.947 --> 01:30:02.547]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:03.488 --> 01:30:06.149]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:10.307 --> 01:30:14.914]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[01:30:15.034 --> 01:30:17.998]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[01:30:18.158 --> 01:30:23.386]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[01:30:23.726 --> 01:30:25.388]  It all comes down to one thing.
[01:30:25.669 --> 01:30:26.470]  We are what we are.
[01:30:26.510 --> 01:30:27.311]  We're good.

[01:33:24.622 --> 01:33:26.224]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:26.665 --> 01:33:30.349]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[01:33:50.993 --> 01:34:05.943]  Well, for folks that like World War III and like wars, I suggest that we give Adolf Hitler a posthumous peace prize, as well as Joseph Stalin, Genghis Khan, Mao Zedong.
[01:34:07.263 --> 01:34:14.508]  And we can start going to our Christian churches and playing this as the children's hymns in Sunday school.
[01:34:14.908 --> 01:34:15.388]  Crank it up!
[01:34:21.081 --> 01:34:28.868]  As you go insane.
[01:34:28.888 --> 01:34:35.353]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:34:36.274 --> 01:34:37.896]  Seasons of the Abyss.
[01:34:47.580 --> 01:34:52.881]  And if I went insane and supported death, murder, and torture, I would then be a trendy.
[01:34:54.601 --> 01:34:56.142]  I could then be invited to the White House.
[01:34:58.422 --> 01:35:00.663]  And be around all the other plastic fake people.
[01:35:01.603 --> 01:35:03.723]  And sit there and shake their hands.
[01:35:04.823 --> 01:35:06.044]  And I would feel powerful.
[01:35:06.724 --> 01:35:12.145]  Man, that would be, I would really be somebody then if I could just, if I could just be part of the dark side.
[01:35:13.134 --> 01:35:14.235]  But you know what, I don't want to do that.
[01:35:15.096 --> 01:35:16.718]  Here's the deal, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:35:16.798 --> 01:35:23.625]  We have an international line that folks can call up to the GCN radio network.
[01:35:23.645 --> 01:35:23.945]  It is 1-651-695-7755.
[01:35:23.965 --> 01:35:24.205]  That's 1-651-695-7755.
[01:35:36.818 --> 01:35:41.779]  And I hardly ever give that number out, but for the network, that is phone lines that go into you for international.
[01:35:42.179 --> 01:35:43.399]  We got some new folks up there today.
[01:35:43.419 --> 01:35:50.120]  So, you can go to 651-695-55 and just enter the country code to call the United States, or you can call us toll-free, 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231, for folks that have IP phones or phone via their Skype.
[01:36:06.724 --> 01:36:07.204]  So again, 800-259-9231.
[01:36:08.104 --> 01:36:15.067]  And hey, why don't we just open our phone systems up here?
[01:36:16.167 --> 01:36:20.768]  We could do that, because this phone system says it's turned off up here on my screen.
[01:36:21.389 --> 01:36:23.169]  So we'll go with our phone system.
[01:36:23.669 --> 01:36:24.510]  Let's turn it on.
[01:36:24.530 --> 01:36:28.771]  Because again, how do I reboot that?
[01:36:28.971 --> 01:36:30.191]  Just so I can understand.
[01:36:30.211 --> 01:36:32.732]  Do I get up and reboot that phone system right there?
[01:36:34.013 --> 01:36:34.833]  Guys, the Comrex?
[01:36:36.288 --> 01:36:36.848]  What do I do?
[01:36:38.108 --> 01:36:39.449]  No, it's turned off.
[01:36:39.489 --> 01:36:40.249]  See, it says idle.
[01:36:41.289 --> 01:36:43.449]  If it says that, you better believe it's turned off.
[01:36:44.849 --> 01:36:46.890]  Don't mean to do this stuff here on air, folks.
[01:36:47.730 --> 01:36:49.930]  We got new folks up there running things in Genesis.
[01:36:49.950 --> 01:36:50.770]  They're doing a great job.
[01:36:50.790 --> 01:36:52.051]  We'll figure all this out in a minute.
[01:36:52.931 --> 01:37:00.892]  But I want to hear from everybody out there, so you can call in to the broadcast 800-259-9231.
[01:37:00.932 --> 01:37:01.352]  Yeah, it's on now.
[01:37:06.193 --> 01:37:09.576]  Because we always have every phone line ringing, even when it's off.
[01:37:09.957 --> 01:37:11.358]  People are ringing non-stop.
[01:37:11.378 --> 01:37:13.960]  So I know if it says idle, the phone system's turned off.
[01:37:14.461 --> 01:37:15.122]  So there you go.
[01:37:15.142 --> 01:37:18.024]  The toll-free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[01:37:22.288 --> 01:37:27.370]  If you're in the Middle East, I would like to hear from you.
[01:37:27.390 --> 01:37:28.390]  800-259-9231.
[01:37:29.351 --> 01:37:36.394]  Or you can call the international line with your country code and 651-695-7755.
[01:37:37.154 --> 01:37:39.015]  And we will try to get you up and on the air.
[01:37:39.295 --> 01:37:41.956]  We'll take some calls if they come in from the Middle East.
[01:37:42.296 --> 01:37:44.417]  Normally I can give out any number anywhere in the world.
[01:37:45.197 --> 01:37:54.343]  And people will call in from Germany, Japan, China, South Korea, South Africa, Nigeria, I can give the number out they call.
[01:37:54.664 --> 01:38:08.293]  So I want to hear from folks in the Middle East, specifically places like Israel, specifically places going into more of Asia, Central Asia like Persia, Iran, but the big one is Israel or Syria.
[01:38:08.473 --> 01:38:14.117]  I would like to hear from you here on the broadcast today.
[01:38:15.339 --> 01:38:30.803]  Now as those calls are coming in for calls only in the Middle East, ladies and gentlemen, I am going to go over a few of the other headlines that are up on InfoWars.com.
[01:38:31.624 --> 01:38:35.585]  Again, red-linked at the top, Ron Paul's Syrian chemical attack, a false flag.
[01:38:36.826 --> 01:38:41.991]  Also, another report, Paul Watson put out a shocking story that could derail attack on Syria.
[01:38:42.371 --> 01:38:47.097]  Will the mainstream media ignore a story that could derail the march to war?
[01:38:47.637 --> 01:38:53.603]  And that is the story put out by AP Reporter, talking to people on the ground that the chemical attack was launched by the rebels.
[01:38:54.184 --> 01:38:56.925]  Well, WorldNetDaily got the videos of it four days ago, folks.
[01:38:57.545 --> 01:39:00.766]  Child taken because dad read a gun magazine.
[01:39:00.906 --> 01:39:01.546]  I'm not kidding.
[01:39:01.586 --> 01:39:03.086]  That's actually confirmed in court documents.
[01:39:03.106 --> 01:39:04.346]  You can read that article.
[01:39:04.386 --> 01:39:08.547]  The persecution and purge of gun owners accelerates.
[01:39:08.607 --> 01:39:12.408]  Individual morality is the last firewall against psychopathic takeover.
[01:39:12.848 --> 01:39:16.349]  Daniel Taylor wrote a great article that basically mirrors what I was saying here yesterday.
[01:39:17.229 --> 01:39:19.030]  So, liberty minds think alike.
[01:39:19.590 --> 01:39:20.810]  Again, there's the article I mentioned.
[01:39:20.890 --> 01:39:23.471]  Rebels admit responsibility for chemical weapons attack.
[01:39:24.841 --> 01:39:28.184]  Twenty-five quotes about the coming war with Syria that every American should see.
[01:39:28.204 --> 01:39:36.372]  Also, we have reports, Ron Paul, why are we on the side of Al-Qaeda in Syria?
[01:39:36.392 --> 01:39:37.373]  We already played that clip.
[01:39:38.113 --> 01:39:42.677]  So that is just some of the news and information.
[01:39:42.697 --> 01:39:45.140]  And again, we have loaded, flooded phone lines.
[01:39:45.160 --> 01:39:47.001]  Just keep calling till we get to you.
[01:39:47.662 --> 01:39:50.803]  Because other people are calling who aren't calling from the Middle East, so it's hard to get to you.
[01:39:50.823 --> 01:39:56.806]  We have to go through 10 callers calling in from America before we can get through to people calling from the Middle East.
[01:39:56.866 --> 01:40:00.067]  Please, folks, don't call if you're not in the Middle East, okay?
[01:40:00.527 --> 01:40:04.889]  I know we don't screen calls normally, so everybody just calls, but we're taking calls from the Middle East.
[01:40:04.949 --> 01:40:06.210]  And by the way,
[01:40:08.883 --> 01:40:12.684]  I hope that there isn't a strike this weekend, and I hope things don't get out of hand.
[01:40:13.565 --> 01:40:15.825]  But this is definitely a dangerous road we're going down.
[01:40:16.286 --> 01:40:21.087]  It's a miracle we haven't had a nuclear war, a bio war, a chemical war on a wide scale yet.
[01:40:22.268 --> 01:40:24.789]  And people think because it hasn't happened yet it isn't going to happen.
[01:40:25.069 --> 01:40:30.290]  Let me tell you, tyranny has happened in places in China where some estimates Mao killed over 80 million people.
[01:40:31.191 --> 01:40:32.691]  The CIA estimates 64 million.
[01:40:35.172 --> 01:40:42.915]  You know, Hitler killed tens of millions, Stalin tens of millions, Lenin tens of millions, Castro hundreds of thousands, Pol Pot millions.
[01:40:42.935 --> 01:40:45.576]  I mean, this is, government's dangerous, folks.
[01:40:45.877 --> 01:40:52.039]  And we got a bunch of crazy people all over the world running governments because they hunger for it in command of these major systems.
[01:40:52.059 --> 01:40:57.121]  We're going to go to John and others that are now getting up there on the board, coming up here in a few minutes.
[01:40:57.181 --> 01:41:00.403]  First off, drumroll, document cam, please.
[01:41:01.603 --> 01:41:02.524]  We just got in
[01:41:03.999 --> 01:41:30.973]  The September issue, so this is now the 13th issue, because the first one was September last year, the 13th Lucky Patriot issue of InfoWars Magazine, and let me just say that it is absolutely stunning, and I, last night I was up here at 10, 1030 at night, and an 18-wheeler pulled in to drop off the magazines.
[01:41:32.305 --> 01:41:33.946]  The 100,000 magazines plus.
[01:41:35.006 --> 01:41:35.427]  A.T.
[01:41:35.447 --> 01:41:42.210]  Wheeler loaded with glossy, big, juicy, color, print 2.0 magazines.
[01:41:43.671 --> 01:41:45.572]  And so I had a chance to see it.
[01:41:46.112 --> 01:41:48.873]  And now it's up on the shopping cart at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:41:48.893 --> 01:41:53.456]  You can subscribe and get this and the next 12 issues at cost because it's a goal to wake people up.
[01:41:53.656 --> 01:41:55.937]  It's basically a big, glossy, colored book is what it is.
[01:41:57.595 --> 01:42:03.961]  Filled with fact toys, globalist quotes, patriot quotes, anti-New World Order information, pro-Second Amendment, you name it.
[01:42:04.441 --> 01:42:07.064]  You can buy these in groups of 10 up to 100 at cost.
[01:42:07.544 --> 01:42:09.626]  Or you can subscribe and give gift subscriptions.
[01:42:09.646 --> 01:42:10.046]  It's even better.
[01:42:10.287 --> 01:42:14.590]  Imagine your police department, your local library donating it, or your local school.
[01:42:14.891 --> 01:42:16.092]  If you have the funds, do it.
[01:42:18.013 --> 01:42:21.096]  People really pay attention now.
[01:42:22.236 --> 01:42:25.038]  To print, because it's all going out.
[01:42:25.518 --> 01:42:26.319]  So we've got into print.
[01:42:26.339 --> 01:42:28.000]  It's been very successful getting the word out.
[01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:32.063]  The new magazine is, Thou Shalt Not Have Any Gods Above The State.
[01:42:32.543 --> 01:42:33.724]  And it has Obama.
[01:42:34.424 --> 01:42:37.006]  It has Obama on the cover as Christ.
[01:42:37.046 --> 01:42:38.747]  And he's actually been photographed like that.
[01:42:38.767 --> 01:42:48.214]  We took one of the photos of that, of him giving a speech where they implied he was Christ with his halo over him, and posterized it, turning it into a Byzantine-type Christian painting.
[01:42:49.321 --> 01:42:51.022]  So, you need to get it.
[01:42:51.082 --> 01:42:53.082]  And it is 60 color pages.
[01:42:53.682 --> 01:42:54.963]  Jam-packed.
[01:42:56.043 --> 01:43:01.264]  Absolutely jam-packed with the authoritarianism that is political correctness.
[01:43:01.804 --> 01:43:04.245]  And it just goes over all of it.
[01:43:04.285 --> 01:43:08.306]  It covers a lot of other issues as well, like the economy, the police state, the war.
[01:43:09.427 --> 01:43:12.247]  But we break down the persecution of the rodeo clown.
[01:43:13.508 --> 01:43:17.909]  It gets into just how authoritarian the whole PC
[01:43:19.361 --> 01:43:20.382]  I mean it is just really...
[01:43:35.032 --> 01:43:36.032]  Really a great magazine.
[01:43:36.052 --> 01:43:39.113]  It's got a big poster inside of it said, in government we trust.
[01:43:39.693 --> 01:43:42.034]  Infowars.com with a stained glass window.
[01:43:42.454 --> 01:43:45.115]  I mean just a great way to wake people up.
[01:43:45.655 --> 01:43:48.796]  So I just want to add, oh and it's got a great story about Drudge Report.
[01:43:49.917 --> 01:43:50.737]  General George
[01:43:51.757 --> 01:43:55.320]  And it's talking about the Pentagon admitting that because of the Drudge Report, they can't lie anymore.
[01:43:55.340 --> 01:43:56.000]  Remember that story?
[01:43:56.200 --> 01:44:05.367]  Well, we added more to it and then did some fun photoshopping as Matt Drudge, as General Drudge, and it talks about the alternative media and the power of it.
[01:44:06.167 --> 01:44:08.909]  We have a story here that the government is now God.
[01:44:08.929 --> 01:44:11.091]  It just goes into all of it.
[01:44:11.131 --> 01:44:11.911]  I'm very, very proud of it.
[01:44:11.931 --> 01:44:17.535]  We're going to go to your calls now in Israel and Iran and many, many
[01:44:18.840 --> 01:44:22.924]  Many other places over there in the middle in the Middle East.
[01:44:23.625 --> 01:44:30.352]  So again, we've got calls just flooding in now and we're going to be taking those here in just a moment.
[01:44:30.993 --> 01:44:34.877]  Finally, when you're on Infowarsstore.com, it supports the broadcast.
[01:44:34.917 --> 01:44:35.718]  That's secondary.
[01:44:36.238 --> 01:44:37.439]  We have the best gravity
[01:44:38.140 --> 01:44:38.661]  Thank you.
[01:44:57.517 --> 01:44:59.618]  Because it does lower the price of it across the market.
[01:44:59.638 --> 01:45:00.899]  We are the biggest distributor.
[01:45:00.939 --> 01:45:03.300]  We sell over 70% of all ProPures on the planet.
[01:45:03.580 --> 01:45:05.422]  And the reason that is because we sell them so cheap.
[01:45:05.902 --> 01:45:08.623]  InfoWareStore.com, InfoWareShop.com.
[01:45:08.964 --> 01:45:12.726]  Side-by-side comparisons devastates the competition.
[01:45:13.737 --> 01:45:21.159]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, that's InfoWarsTore.com or 888-253-3139 to call and order or ask any other questions.
[01:45:21.179 --> 01:45:21.499]  888-253-3139.
[01:45:21.559 --> 01:45:30.001]  A lot of other great filtration systems as well, like the LifeStraw and other systems at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:45:30.561 --> 01:45:37.123]  Now, as I said, I want to have open phones down for the balance of the broadcast interspersed with some other economic and geopolitical and
[01:45:39.943 --> 01:45:44.627]  Globalist news we're going to be breaking down and also the whole immigration reform situation.
[01:45:44.647 --> 01:45:48.611]  But first, let's take calls to at least the bottom of the hour to get to a lot of these folks.
[01:45:49.031 --> 01:45:59.301]  We're going to go to John in Israel, on Syria, then we'll go to Amir in Iran, and then we'll go to Stephen in North Dakota, just was on an airbase.
[01:46:00.745 --> 01:46:03.206]  I want to talk about B1s that tie into all this.
[01:46:03.226 --> 01:46:04.266]  Yeah, that's my word.
[01:46:04.286 --> 01:46:05.707]  The B1s have been going over the Middle East.
[01:46:06.427 --> 01:46:10.088]  But John in Israel, what is your take on this whole situation?
[01:46:11.949 --> 01:46:12.709]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:46:12.829 --> 01:46:13.489]  Good question.
[01:46:14.650 --> 01:46:19.511]  Well, I can tell you that about 60% of us don't have gas masks.
[01:46:21.012 --> 01:46:23.612]  I can tell you there's about a five hour wait to get a gas mask.
[01:46:23.692 --> 01:46:24.973]  I personally don't have a gas mask.
[01:46:26.750 --> 01:46:27.671]  I don't think I can hear you now.
[01:46:29.433 --> 01:46:31.515]  I'm from the U.S.
[01:46:32.235 --> 01:46:36.680]  actually, and I came here about 15 years ago on vacation, and I ended up staying.
[01:46:37.601 --> 01:46:40.423]  Great place, great beaches, great women, great food, great everything.
[01:46:42.245 --> 01:46:45.969]  But the people, I don't know.
[01:46:46.289 --> 01:46:47.510]  They're not so nervous, I would say.
[01:46:47.630 --> 01:46:48.992]  Not too nervous, not overly nervous.
[01:46:49.753 --> 01:46:57.497]  Well, I guess that's because Israel has been in a continual state of some form of war since it was founded, so I guess, I mean, is that why people are calm?
[01:46:58.818 --> 01:46:59.338]  People are calm.
[01:46:59.358 --> 01:47:02.500]  Also, the newer generation, they're born just like in the States with everything.
[01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:05.641]  They have the malls, they have the food, they have the brand names.
[01:47:05.682 --> 01:47:06.782]  They're just spoiled.
[01:47:07.382 --> 01:47:08.723]  So they feel like they're in a bubble.
[01:47:09.624 --> 01:47:10.624]  They feel like they're in a bubble.
[01:47:10.764 --> 01:47:11.445]  You got that right.
[01:47:12.245 --> 01:47:15.167]  Some say because, you know, his buzz on the side of Assad that
[01:47:16.272 --> 01:47:21.504]  In a way it's good because Hezbollah is against Israel, but obviously we know that the rebels obviously hate us.
[01:47:22.608 --> 01:47:23.849]  Just as much, if not more.
[01:47:24.009 --> 01:47:24.510]  So, you know.
[01:47:24.730 --> 01:47:32.196]  Well, yeah, I mean, Saudi Arabia is the big dog and they've got 80% of Islam behind them, being, you know, the place of Mecca and being Sunnis.
[01:47:32.936 --> 01:47:37.880]  And so, yeah, Saudi Arabia wants to take out Iran, so they want to work Israel into that position.
[01:47:38.300 --> 01:47:44.205]  But, let me tell you, if there's a nuclear war down the road, it doesn't matter how many nukes Israel's got or how many Iran has.
[01:47:44.485 --> 01:47:45.846]  This is not a good idea.
[01:47:46.206 --> 01:47:47.888]  That's why I'm personally against it.
[01:47:48.877 --> 01:47:53.563]  And thank goodness for your show, and I spread the word because of you to as many people as I can.
[01:47:53.583 --> 01:47:56.026]  I have a Prison Planet TV membership.
[01:47:56.106 --> 01:47:59.911]  I drink via Young Jeopardy product, Joel Wallach, all because of you.
[01:47:59.931 --> 01:48:04.237]  And we love you here, and I must say, you are number one, and thank you for everything you do.
[01:48:04.616 --> 01:48:05.396]  Well, thank you, sir.
[01:48:05.757 --> 01:48:08.018]  I mean, one last thing, sir.
[01:48:08.098 --> 01:48:13.421]  I mean, is the media over there saying... Because some Israeli papers say the strike's Saturday.
[01:48:13.781 --> 01:48:15.502]  They are pulling out the peacekeepers Saturday.
[01:48:15.522 --> 01:48:18.063]  I mean, what's the word there?
[01:48:18.103 --> 01:48:19.504]  Are people expecting a strike?
[01:48:19.824 --> 01:48:21.185]  A limited strike or no strike?
[01:48:23.286 --> 01:48:25.067]  People don't really know, to tell you the truth.
[01:48:25.487 --> 01:48:28.328]  I think the media here must be obviously state-run.
[01:48:28.408 --> 01:48:32.991]  I think the Israelis and the Americans must be pretty in cahoots in just about everything, you know?
[01:48:34.161 --> 01:48:34.901]  I don't know what to tell you.
[01:48:34.941 --> 01:48:35.461]  People don't know.
[01:48:35.481 --> 01:48:36.922]  They don't know who's going to win.
[01:48:36.982 --> 01:48:41.003]  It's going to be the weapons salesmen and folks and the politicians everywhere.
[01:48:41.023 --> 01:48:41.883]  That's real complex.
[01:48:41.963 --> 01:48:43.003]  You got that right, my friend.
[01:48:43.443 --> 01:48:44.603]  All right, I appreciate you calling in.
[01:48:44.623 --> 01:48:45.163]  Thank you very much.
[01:48:45.223 --> 01:48:45.464]  You bet.
[01:48:45.484 --> 01:48:45.864]  Thank you.
[01:48:45.884 --> 01:48:48.964]  All right, let's talk to Amir in Iran.
[01:48:48.984 --> 01:48:50.625]  He wants to talk about Syria.
[01:48:50.645 --> 01:48:51.505]  Amir, thanks for calling.
[01:48:52.965 --> 01:48:54.025]  No problem, Alex.
[01:48:54.606 --> 01:48:56.066]  It's an honor to talk to you.
[01:48:56.266 --> 01:49:00.667]  I just want to let you know, like, nobody really can call
[01:49:01.400 --> 01:49:02.740]  From Iran directly.
[01:49:02.760 --> 01:49:28.527]  Actually, I live in Austin, but I'm from Iran, and I've been there a few years ago, and I'm just... I just want to let you know, I recently watched a video from YouTube, and if you have a pen to write down this and look up in YouTube and find this video, it has really good information.
[01:49:28.547 --> 01:49:30.548]  You already might watch that, but
[01:49:31.275 --> 01:49:37.819]  It's called The Truth About The Middle East.
[01:49:38.660 --> 01:49:39.660]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:49:39.680 --> 01:49:40.441]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:49:41.601 --> 01:49:45.564]  I have been invited many times on press TV out of England, also in Iran.
[01:49:45.604 --> 01:49:50.046]  I've gone a few times, but they always call up like 30 minutes before they want me on, and that's why I can't ever do it.
[01:49:50.727 --> 01:49:52.908]  But I'll go on any big TV network and put out the truth.
[01:49:52.928 --> 01:49:58.532]  You know, I've been on Japanese, British, Russian, you name it, Canadian, you know, Chilean, Brazilian.
[01:49:59.392 --> 01:50:05.676]  And I've been criticized for going on Iran television, but I mean, you're saying people can't call to the U.S.
[01:50:05.696 --> 01:50:07.938]  from Iran, even on IP phones?
[01:50:08.918 --> 01:50:15.523]  They do call, they do call, but all the call is monitored, and especially if it goes to U.S.
[01:50:16.083 --> 01:50:26.210]  And I'm just saying, if you think somebody can call directly from them, basically most people would call you if they live in the U.S.
[01:50:26.390 --> 01:50:26.430]  or
[01:50:27.080 --> 01:50:28.161]  Sure, sure, sure.
[01:50:28.201 --> 01:50:30.864]  Let me ask you real quick.
[01:50:30.884 --> 01:50:31.944]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:50:31.965 --> 01:50:33.766]  So an Iranian living in Austin, Texas.
[01:50:33.786 --> 01:50:37.289]  What do you think of this whole situation?
[01:50:37.770 --> 01:50:40.052]  I mean, do you think it's going to be bad?
[01:50:52.233 --> 01:51:00.463]  I recently followed the news and in Iran one of the military guys, he's saying, the one
[01:51:06.563 --> 01:51:10.806]  Yeah, they're going to support them like they already support them.
[01:51:10.826 --> 01:51:11.786]  Absolutely.
[01:51:11.806 --> 01:51:17.409]  They're sending a lot of... AccuVoterFilters.com has a special discount offer for all GCN listeners.

[01:53:25.908 --> 01:53:30.232]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[01:53:30.572 --> 01:53:34.555]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[01:53:34.776 --> 01:53:37.118]  All of this has been engineered by design.

[01:54:19.096 --> 01:54:31.858]  Regardless of what you think about Assad and Hezbollah and Iran,
[01:54:46.744 --> 01:54:55.471]  It's not right to put Al-Qaeda in their country and destabilize the whole place and then have our media cover up the slaughter of Christians en masse.
[01:54:55.571 --> 01:54:57.773]  It is going to turn out bad one way or another.
[01:54:59.554 --> 01:55:06.580]  And what this is really all about is global domination by financial and corporate interests that want to control the entire planet.
[01:55:08.601 --> 01:55:15.567]  And they're not going to let any number of dead civilians stand in the way because after all there's too many people anyway according to their worldview.
[01:55:16.704 --> 01:55:20.929]  And I run into trendies and yuppies who'll even say, well there are too many people.
[01:55:21.170 --> 01:55:22.792]  Well how about you get killed then?
[01:55:23.252 --> 01:55:24.534]  How about your kids die?
[01:55:25.395 --> 01:55:25.875]  Oh no!
[01:55:26.196 --> 01:55:26.816]  Is that a threat?
[01:55:26.856 --> 01:55:27.758]  I'll call the police!
[01:55:28.058 --> 01:55:28.298]  No!
[01:55:30.051 --> 01:55:32.932]  I'm saying, how can you be so immoral?
[01:55:33.372 --> 01:55:34.212]  And I'll tell you why.
[01:55:34.552 --> 01:55:37.293]  They're not even so much immoral, they have never lived.
[01:55:37.993 --> 01:55:50.437]  If someone hasn't been abused, if someone hasn't been robbed, if someone hasn't had bad things happen to them, and I'm not saying it's good to have bad things happen to you, but it's like what Nietzsche said, that which does not kill you only makes you stronger.
[01:55:50.977 --> 01:55:56.019]  I have noticed that sheltered, coddled people become incredibly self-centered,
[01:55:57.017 --> 01:56:00.260]  Incredibly arrogant and incredibly bloodthirsty.
[01:56:02.701 --> 01:56:06.024]  And they start thinking of themselves as the establishment when you're not.
[01:56:07.065 --> 01:56:08.065]  But look at the establishment.
[01:56:08.125 --> 01:56:08.806]  They're coddled.
[01:56:09.106 --> 01:56:09.947]  They're insulated.
[01:56:10.207 --> 01:56:11.608]  They're separated from the people.
[01:56:13.490 --> 01:56:15.751]  I mean, oh my goodness, their security is paramount.
[01:56:16.031 --> 01:56:17.933]  Everybody else can just roll over and die.
[01:56:18.213 --> 01:56:18.774]  Well, you know what?
[01:56:18.974 --> 01:56:21.796]  When you build a world like that, everybody's security gets lost.
[01:56:23.171 --> 01:56:27.133]  Tyrants throughout history always set up systems that end up destroying them or their children.
[01:56:28.473 --> 01:56:31.495]  So the globalists are their own worst enemy, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:56:33.035 --> 01:56:34.196]  I want to go to your phone calls.
[01:56:34.216 --> 01:56:35.516]  We've got a bunch of callers calling in.
[01:56:35.797 --> 01:56:36.677]  It's open phones now.
[01:56:37.777 --> 01:56:39.638]  We took some foreign calls.
[01:56:39.658 --> 01:56:40.358]  800-259-9231.
[01:56:40.379 --> 01:56:43.460]  And we'll go to your calls.
[01:56:43.560 --> 01:56:47.802]  James, we have other callers saying this, wants to talk about B-2 bombers left Missouri
[01:56:48.894 --> 01:56:52.875]  Yesterday one was leaving Montana last week and crashed as well.
[01:56:52.955 --> 01:57:03.518]  I have that story here So yeah, they're moving those around which that's the type of thing you'd use against the Russians What is your take on this sir and tell folks about those bombers leaving?
[01:57:06.979 --> 01:57:12.020]  Yeah, I live in town Belton probably about 30 miles from Whiteman Air Force Base.
[01:57:12.120 --> 01:57:12.881]  I'm a physician.
[01:57:12.961 --> 01:57:14.181]  I have a practice near there and
[01:57:14.941 --> 01:57:16.302]  In about 6 p.m.
[01:57:16.462 --> 01:57:24.185]  Central Time yesterday, I don't know how many planes would be in a squadron, but we see them flying around all the time practicing.
[01:57:24.285 --> 01:57:31.508]  Usually there's two bombers at the most when they're practicing, but at least five bombers left yesterday heading east.
[01:57:32.308 --> 01:57:38.130]  And then my wife called me this morning when I was doing rounds and said that she—it's an unmistakable engine sound that they have.
[01:57:39.031 --> 01:57:42.272]  And it appeared that there was several more that left early this morning.
[01:57:43.449 --> 01:57:48.674]  There hasn't been any reports of anything on the news that I've heard as of yet, but there was at least five.
[01:57:48.914 --> 01:57:57.941]  I was called by a family friend I've known in West Texas where summer stations he said they left last week in the early morning about 5 a.m.
[01:57:58.001 --> 01:57:59.262]  and woke him up.
[01:58:00.243 --> 01:58:05.847]  Some others stationed out west left last week, and one crashed, because these things are falling apart.
[01:58:06.168 --> 01:58:08.409]  They were crashing back in the 80s when they first came out.
[01:58:08.710 --> 01:58:18.817]  They're a great weapons system when they actually work, but they're... I don't want to get into the whole history of the B-1 bomber, but it's very interesting, the large batwing fighter, medium-range bomber.
[01:58:19.858 --> 01:58:22.240]  And it's made for delivering nuclear payloads, obviously.
[01:58:23.301 --> 01:58:26.463]  And the fact that they're all going east, this is pretty serious.
[01:58:26.503 --> 01:58:27.444]  What do you think's going on?
[01:58:27.764 --> 01:58:28.625]  Total mobilization?
[01:58:31.399 --> 01:58:36.943]  Since he's going in alone, he's more likely moving the bombers out there since we're not having help from the UK.
[01:58:37.063 --> 01:58:41.347]  It makes more sense that they would be moving his bombers into position to do whatever they need to do.
[01:58:41.367 --> 01:58:43.869]  Do you have anything else you'd like to add?
[01:58:44.769 --> 01:58:47.872]  Something's not right about this.
[01:58:47.892 --> 01:58:48.652]  Stay there, stay there.

[02:00:03.140 --> 02:00:05.066]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:05.547 --> 02:00:08.296]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:14.841 --> 02:00:28.231]  By the way, I do this all the time because I'm taking calls, I've got so much going on, and then later I hear it and realize I said the opposite.
[02:00:28.291 --> 02:00:28.852]  Sometimes I
[02:00:45.126 --> 02:00:46.086]  Flip things around.
[02:00:46.106 --> 02:00:49.388]  I'm no weapons expert, but I've seen Discovery Channel shows about it.
[02:00:49.408 --> 02:00:52.569]  When I was a kid, I'd watch it on the news when they would crash and things.
[02:00:53.390 --> 02:00:56.571]  The B-1 bomber is swept wing, not bat wing.
[02:00:58.052 --> 02:01:03.674]  And I'm always calling it bat wing instead of swept wing when I know the complete difference.
[02:01:03.694 --> 02:01:09.717]  The point is, as it goes faster, the wings can be brought in to the sides of the aircraft.
[02:01:11.698 --> 02:01:13.639]  And when those things get deployed overseas,
[02:01:15.913 --> 02:01:18.095]  I mean, you know it's a serious situation.
[02:01:22.120 --> 02:01:30.790]  And they definitely have been crashing, crash-landing, exploding, you name it, in the last week.
[02:01:31.731 --> 02:01:34.674]  In fact, B-1 bomber crashes in southeast Montana.
[02:01:35.215 --> 02:01:36.116]  CBS News.
[02:01:37.585 --> 02:01:39.806]  Perhaps we can pull that article up for folks.
[02:01:40.926 --> 02:01:46.709]  But they're keeping it very, very quiet while they've been having emergency landings of them, crashes, you name it.
[02:01:46.749 --> 02:01:48.770]  It's because they've got the whole fleet.
[02:01:50.771 --> 02:01:53.454]  Moving to the East Coast, they probably left the United States.
[02:01:53.514 --> 02:01:56.177]  We don't know that, because that's all secretive and classified.
[02:01:56.797 --> 02:02:02.883]  And that would be something they would use for a high-altitude strike on Syria.
[02:02:02.903 --> 02:02:04.345]  And again, I'm no weapons expert.
[02:02:04.665 --> 02:02:06.848]  Air Force folks can call in if they can get in on air.
[02:02:07.428 --> 02:02:13.895]  But generally, if they're just taking out low- and medium-level-type military targets, they would use cruise missiles.
[02:02:15.336 --> 02:02:23.622]  But when they really want to drop big bunker-busting bombs, say on the top military brass or Assad, it would be something like a B-1 bomber.
[02:02:24.403 --> 02:02:26.685]  Or they would use a B-1 bomber.
[02:02:29.801 --> 02:02:35.645]  If they were wanting to drop nukes, because that's what it was originally designed for, was to race over into Europe under the radar.
[02:02:35.665 --> 02:02:41.449]  It was meant to fly low with ground following radar and nuke the Russians.
[02:02:42.370 --> 02:02:43.590]  So, I don't know.
[02:02:43.771 --> 02:02:44.971]  It's just, it's really bad.
[02:02:45.111 --> 02:02:53.917]  I mean, believe me, they wouldn't be moving those over there if they weren't thinking about using them from all the military people I've talked to and the research I've done with this swept wing fighter.
[02:02:54.338 --> 02:02:58.661]  And if they're being moved over there, you can bet the B-2s, the stealth bombers,
[02:02:59.281 --> 02:02:59.761]  I don't think so.
[02:03:21.370 --> 02:03:24.074]  Yesterday afternoon, it got there early morning hours.
[02:03:24.094 --> 02:03:29.723]  I was possibly expecting a strike with them early this morning, but maybe they're just moving them over there to position them.
[02:03:32.943 --> 02:03:33.444]  Absolutely.
[02:03:33.464 --> 02:03:34.925]  So this is B-2 bombers.
[02:03:35.245 --> 02:03:36.706]  This is the B-2, but not the B-1.
[02:03:36.806 --> 02:03:40.228]  It is the B-2 stealth bomber that's based at Whiteman.
[02:03:40.268 --> 02:03:48.954]  Yeah, because I've had B-1s on the mind since I heard about them taking off from a base they're at in West Texas, and then one crashing last week in Montana.
[02:03:49.315 --> 02:03:57.240]  So you have seen the B-2s leaving and in numbers larger than they normally do with training, and you didn't see them come back?
[02:03:58.061 --> 02:03:58.721]  That is correct.
[02:04:00.589 --> 02:04:02.571]  I mean, they make a very distinctive sound.
[02:04:02.591 --> 02:04:07.437]  I've seen them in air shows and I'm a private pilot, so I've seen them around and I know the sound that they make.
[02:04:07.457 --> 02:04:10.320]  This is much, much louder noise.
[02:04:10.340 --> 02:04:20.131]  That's why I'm shocked that nobody has talked about this on the news, but I saw at least five of them leave and I stayed outside watching because we would have heard them come back, that many.
[02:04:20.532 --> 02:04:21.413]  They never came back.
[02:04:22.171 --> 02:04:23.711]  And maybe they're just doing training missions.
[02:04:24.132 --> 02:04:27.132]  I don't know, but it's awfully suspicious.
[02:04:27.313 --> 02:04:30.053]  And then it happened again this morning where they were leaving.
[02:04:30.433 --> 02:04:32.374]  My wife said that they were definitely leaving.
[02:04:32.874 --> 02:04:35.475]  They weren't returning from their flight.
[02:04:36.995 --> 02:04:41.337]  And they can fly them nonstop from Missouri to wherever they need to go.
[02:04:42.577 --> 02:04:42.997]  Wow.
[02:04:44.097 --> 02:04:45.278]  Well, what do you think's going on?
[02:04:45.318 --> 02:04:46.258]  What's your gut tell you?
[02:04:47.113 --> 02:04:48.735]  I think they're moving them over in position.
[02:04:48.775 --> 02:04:54.760]  Either they're expecting a war with Russia or possibly, as you said, to bomb the heck out of Syria.
[02:04:55.261 --> 02:04:59.665]  Because they can do it from high altitude and with precision without anybody even knowing.
[02:04:59.865 --> 02:05:00.126]  Sure.
[02:05:00.186 --> 02:05:00.486]  Wow.
[02:05:00.526 --> 02:05:01.707]  Thank you so much for that call.
[02:05:02.348 --> 02:05:05.251]  We're getting a lot of calls about B-1s and B-2s leaving.
[02:05:05.551 --> 02:05:06.612]  Can we do some searches?
[02:05:06.632 --> 02:05:07.233]  I know you are.
[02:05:07.613 --> 02:05:08.814]  See if any of that's in the news.
[02:05:09.054 --> 02:05:09.455]  We'll be back.
[02:05:10.540 --> 02:05:13.322]  Protecting your home with a security system is a must.

[02:05:19.926 --> 02:05:26.310]  Listen, there is some real scum in the alarm business cashing in by locking you into long, punishing contracts.
[02:05:26.710 --> 02:05:28.651]  Not with SimpliSafe Home Security.
[02:05:29.012 --> 02:05:30.052]  They're the good guys.

[02:05:59.552 --> 02:06:07.278]  Why do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year betting their lives that the disaster won't get them?
[02:06:07.358 --> 02:06:08.659]  Hundreds of
[02:06:23.022 --> 02:06:25.603]  We have 50,000 donated meals to the Oklahoma victims.
[02:06:25.883 --> 02:06:27.804]  The problem is we can't help everybody.
[02:06:28.044 --> 02:06:34.166]  If every one of us who can, will take care of ourselves, we can all pitch in to take care of those who really can't.
[02:06:34.466 --> 02:06:42.269]  The new Just In Case Pack from eFoods Direct is the big brother to the 7-Day Emergency Pack designed for Oklahoma disaster donations.

[02:07:09.867 --> 02:07:14.452]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[02:07:14.592 --> 02:07:17.556]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[02:07:17.716 --> 02:07:22.942]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[02:07:23.282 --> 02:07:24.944]  It all comes down to one thing.
[02:07:25.225 --> 02:07:26.546]  We are what we eat.
[02:07:26.846 --> 02:07:28.268]  Our food is devoid of nutrition.
[02:07:28.288 --> 02:07:28.989]  We're good to go.
[02:07:54.548 --> 02:08:00.350]  The fight against the New World Order starts with you, and you can't stand against the machine of your sick, tired, and obese.

[02:08:10.614 --> 02:08:10.914]  We've got it.
[02:08:10.934 --> 02:08:14.875]  The Christmas is coming to you.
[02:08:17.492 --> 02:08:19.893]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:08:21.874 --> 02:08:27.297]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:08:27.337 --> 02:08:36.462]  Now, about an hour and a half ago, if you just joined us, the Communist News Network
[02:08:46.295 --> 02:08:53.873]  CNN came out and reported that Assad had launched another chemical attack on Monday that they hadn't told us about.
[02:08:54.294 --> 02:08:56.158]  We reported on that baloney on Wednesday.
[02:08:58.613 --> 02:09:04.776]  Now they're saying there's been new chemical attacks today, and that's on a bunch of channels.
[02:09:05.136 --> 02:09:08.398]  I just saw it on CNN out here, MSNBC in there.
[02:09:08.458 --> 02:09:11.200]  They were telling me in the back office it's on Fox News.
[02:09:12.060 --> 02:09:12.800]  More U.S.
[02:09:12.820 --> 02:09:14.681]  warships arrive in the region.
[02:09:15.362 --> 02:09:17.383]  Another one showed up today.
[02:09:18.443 --> 02:09:23.246]  Obama is set to speak on Syria in minutes, so he's probably
[02:09:26.462 --> 02:09:28.143]  He's probably going to announce they're going to attack him.
[02:09:28.963 --> 02:09:46.591]  He'll probably give Assad, because it makes him look like he's wired up or something, he'll probably give Assad two days or something to give up and leave, if I had to guess, or there's going to be more action.
[02:09:48.092 --> 02:09:52.174]  So as soon as El Presidente, the dear leader,
[02:09:55.211 --> 02:09:59.775]  As soon as he comes on, we will go to it.
[02:09:59.855 --> 02:10:06.241]  So Kerry was there to come out and say, we know Assad did it, then add the proviso, I have the transcript right here, that we don't know who did it.
[02:10:08.423 --> 02:10:09.564]  That's that new thing they do.
[02:10:12.186 --> 02:10:15.929]  It's so bizarre, where they'll have it both ways.
[02:10:16.009 --> 02:10:17.711]  Like, we know he did it, but we don't know who did it.
[02:10:17.891 --> 02:10:21.734]  But we gotta attack him regardless, because the war is terrible and people are dying.
[02:10:22.711 --> 02:10:35.786]  Acting like Assad killed everybody when it's about the people of that nation that had the West come in with foreign rebels to blow the daylights out of every police station, every military base, every mosque that's not Sunni.
[02:10:36.727 --> 02:10:40.732]  Imagine the Shiite mosque, the Wahhabis are going after them.
[02:10:42.196 --> 02:10:47.600]  The Al Qaeda Wahhabists are going after the minority Zoroastrians, the Jews, the Christians.
[02:10:48.101 --> 02:10:50.022]  It is unprecedented.
[02:10:50.422 --> 02:10:53.044]  And then they get up there and talk about moral authority.
[02:10:54.506 --> 02:10:59.149]  You know, I was intending to do a rebroadcast Sunday, and everybody's getting it edited and put together.
[02:10:59.169 --> 02:11:00.310]  I was going to tape some stuff for it.
[02:11:00.370 --> 02:11:02.071]  I don't think that's going to be happening.
[02:11:02.091 --> 02:11:04.693]  I think we're going to be live this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:11:04.733 --> 02:11:06.255]  In fact, we just need to go ahead and decide that.
[02:11:07.816 --> 02:11:12.699]  And I'll be live in here on Monday, regardless, with David Knight riding shotgun with me.
[02:11:13.439 --> 02:11:18.362]  If there's not an attack, I just don't even know anymore.
[02:11:19.422 --> 02:11:22.264]  I've got so much going on in my head, I can hardly even think, if you know what I mean.
[02:11:22.324 --> 02:11:27.367]  I mean, this is outrageous, to see them, where they can inject rebels into a country,
[02:11:28.442 --> 02:11:42.066]  Two and a half years later, talk about the disaster as if somebody else did it, and then get caught, as Ron Paul said on Fox News, staging false flags, video of the jihadis loading the chemicals, AP reporters saying, oh, the rebels admit they did it.
[02:11:43.902 --> 02:11:45.963]  Because the rebels are just a bunch of riffraff.
[02:11:46.523 --> 02:11:50.786]  People say, well, I mean, Al-Qaeda, like, loves America and works for the CIA.
[02:11:51.066 --> 02:11:54.768]  The CIA opens the door for them to come in and gives them the weapons.
[02:11:55.168 --> 02:11:55.989]  Israel does that.
[02:11:56.109 --> 02:11:56.969]  NATO does that.
[02:11:57.029 --> 02:12:00.131]  Saudi Arabia is really honchoing it more than anybody else.
[02:12:00.651 --> 02:12:01.592]  They're running the show.
[02:12:03.913 --> 02:12:06.595]  And it's so frustrating to see this happening, and then...
[02:12:07.754 --> 02:12:22.538]  I have one of my friends call me from out in West Texas where they have the B-1 station, the old swept wing, I was calling it bat wing earlier, the swept wing fighters, the nuclear strike fighters, or medium sized bombers, aren't really fighters.
[02:12:24.399 --> 02:12:32.201]  And then now we've got reports coming in of up in Missouri and areas of the B-2 bombers taking off.
[02:12:33.021 --> 02:12:34.322]  I'd like to check that.
[02:12:34.362 --> 02:12:36.003]  I know we're looking at the chemical weapons news.
[02:12:36.343 --> 02:12:38.204]  Is there any news about what's being deployed?
[02:12:38.224 --> 02:12:49.371]  I mean, the British News is reporting fighters and things are being deployed to Cyprus, which is about 95 miles away from the coast of Syria, and most of the targets.
[02:12:49.711 --> 02:12:50.772]  You got four U.S.
[02:12:50.832 --> 02:12:52.933]  missile cruisers now there.
[02:12:52.953 --> 02:12:54.154]  Well, four were there yesterday.
[02:12:54.474 --> 02:12:55.515]  One more arrived today.
[02:12:57.932 --> 02:12:59.874]  You've got massive buildup of U.S.
[02:12:59.914 --> 02:13:02.017]  troops in Jordan going back months ago.
[02:13:02.618 --> 02:13:04.280]  That's a big controversy why they won't leave.
[02:13:04.440 --> 02:13:06.022]  The Jordanians are asking why are they here.
[02:13:06.522 --> 02:13:07.484]  They came in for a drill.
[02:13:08.445 --> 02:13:08.905]  There's U.S.
[02:13:08.925 --> 02:13:10.707]  troops deployed into the Gaza area.
[02:13:11.028 --> 02:13:12.470]  I mean, they're getting ready for something big.
[02:13:13.925 --> 02:13:15.506]  And I hope this doesn't happen.
[02:13:16.167 --> 02:13:18.569]  Alright, I said I'd go to your phone calls, the toll-free number to join us.
[02:13:19.029 --> 02:13:27.855]  If you have seen B-2 bombers taking off, B-1 bombers, if you have family that's deployed over there, if you have a breakdown of what you think is going to happen.
[02:13:29.697 --> 02:13:38.944]  The good news is, for the first time in over 200 years, the British Parliament voted down a request to authorize war by the Prime Minister.
[02:13:41.007 --> 02:13:46.829]  France is running around, of course being contrary, begging for an attack, saying they absolutely must have one.
[02:13:46.869 --> 02:13:47.769]  That's in the news today.
[02:13:49.049 --> 02:13:50.830]  Just bizarre behavior out of the frogs.
[02:13:52.050 --> 02:13:58.052]  And then you've got Kerry caught lying over and over again.
[02:13:59.308 --> 02:14:20.701]  You've got 9% approval ratings for this to happen, and I guess they've got to launch a war in a way, as I feared at the start of the show today, because they need to cover up the fact that all of the confidence in them is imploding, and that the dollar's on the verge of collapsing because of overprinting and derivatives, and this war will actually make the dollar go up.
[02:14:22.915 --> 02:14:28.777]  Because everybody will rush in trying to prop it up and do it out of fear, but long-term, even short-term, this is a disaster.
[02:14:29.757 --> 02:14:40.780]  And at the start of the show, I saw the whole world turn against this attack, and Americans wake up and be against it, and 150 plus members of Congress, Republican and Democrat, say, you can't do this, this is unconstitutional, you've got to come to us.
[02:14:41.680 --> 02:14:45.041]  And so I'm thinking, man, this looks like we may not have this nightmare happen.
[02:14:46.441 --> 02:14:48.122]  But it doesn't seem to matter.
[02:14:51.038 --> 02:14:54.060]  Because the New World Order wants to do what they want to do.
[02:14:54.420 --> 02:14:56.501]  And Obama is set to speak in minutes.
[02:14:57.822 --> 02:15:00.183]  Now, sometimes it takes longer, but we'll see what happens.
[02:15:00.203 --> 02:15:01.004]  We're going to follow this.
[02:15:01.404 --> 02:15:03.565]  Animal Nightly News tonight, 7 o'clock Central.
[02:15:04.285 --> 02:15:07.367]  But many analysts believe this could trigger World War III.
[02:15:11.109 --> 02:15:12.470]  Absolutely incredible.
[02:15:12.950 --> 02:15:19.654]  And we'll also, after we take calls, go over the transcript of the remarks by Kerry on Syria.
[02:15:21.068 --> 02:15:22.229]  And again, here's the Guardian.
[02:15:22.449 --> 02:15:25.051]  Warplanes massing in Cyprus as tensions rise.
[02:15:25.091 --> 02:15:26.753]  I mean, this is a serious situation.
[02:15:27.193 --> 02:15:32.638]  And I believe our callers, because I have a friend that called me about it in West Texas, with the B-1s.
[02:15:32.658 --> 02:15:35.980]  That's why I kept conflating it with the B-2s.
[02:15:37.001 --> 02:15:40.684]  And now we're getting calls saying the same thing.
[02:15:42.286 --> 02:15:44.087]  So, we haven't confirmed that yet, though.
[02:15:44.107 --> 02:15:48.170]  Let's go to Kyle in Omaha, then we'll go to Pauline, Zach, and others.
[02:15:49.447 --> 02:15:50.647]  Go ahead, you're on the air, Kyle.
[02:15:50.667 --> 02:15:52.068]  What's your take on this situation?
[02:15:53.428 --> 02:15:57.869]  God bless you and your broadcast, and I pray for your family and everybody involved in telling the truth.
[02:15:57.889 --> 02:15:58.529]  It's a big deal.
[02:15:58.549 --> 02:16:10.953]  I believe, just like a few years back, we did that first missile defense in Israel to see how we would protect against a missile launched anywhere towards any of our troops or allies.
[02:16:12.441 --> 02:16:24.075]  When we move the Asian Pacific Fleet and we move all these people over there, do we have several of those missile defense set up like that where basically we're trying to flex on Russia and see if they're going to try to go all out war against us?
[02:16:24.599 --> 02:16:25.520]  Well, that's a good point.
[02:16:25.740 --> 02:16:28.321]  Not just the Patriot that's been around for decades over there.
[02:16:28.642 --> 02:16:30.082]  They've brought in the Iron Dome.
[02:16:30.683 --> 02:16:40.509]  They've used some of the Hezbollah and Hamas rocket attacks to try to test it, but those are so low level, it's, it's, it's, it's had mixed results according to what I've read.
[02:16:40.529 --> 02:16:45.332]  I'm certainly not a missile technician, so I'd have to talk to military experts about that.
[02:16:45.352 --> 02:16:51.356]  But yeah, look, they need a world war or a larger regional war at least to get us out of debt.
[02:16:52.383 --> 02:16:55.205]  Well, to get everybody to go along with the tyranny.
[02:16:55.986 --> 02:16:59.129]  And then they may not even have to stage terror attacks if they attack Iran.
[02:16:59.469 --> 02:17:01.871]  Iran's definitely probably got some sleeper cells.
[02:17:02.592 --> 02:17:03.672]  And then that'll just be great.
[02:17:03.793 --> 02:17:04.653]  The globalists don't care.
[02:17:04.693 --> 02:17:06.215]  They're all in armored fortresses anyways.
[02:17:06.515 --> 02:17:07.456]  So what if we get killed?
[02:17:07.736 --> 02:17:09.217]  They get to grandstand as heroes.
[02:17:09.557 --> 02:17:19.285]  And once we get in a war, they know most Americans and Europeans, even if our government starts it, will get behind it, because that's the primitive programming in a human, that if your chief starts a war,
[02:17:20.347 --> 02:17:24.188]  It doesn't matter if you agree with it, you've got to get your spear and get ready to fight because the enemy's coming.
[02:17:24.928 --> 02:17:27.009]  But the enemy is the people running our government.
[02:17:27.449 --> 02:17:31.010]  And they use some outside enemy as the pretext to get us to go along with it.
[02:17:31.490 --> 02:17:32.890]  So that's the full spectrum dominance.
[02:17:32.910 --> 02:17:33.751]  Good to hear from you, Kyle.
[02:17:34.071 --> 02:17:36.191]  Pauline in Colorado, you're on the air.
[02:17:36.231 --> 02:17:36.631]  Go ahead.
[02:17:37.652 --> 02:17:38.892]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[02:17:39.052 --> 02:17:39.832]  Pretty good.
[02:17:40.292 --> 02:17:46.194]  I just wanted to let you know, I drove two hours yesterday to go speak to my congressman, Congressman Polis.
[02:17:47.360 --> 02:17:50.760]  Ask him specifically because I'm in the overpass of Colorado here.
[02:17:51.417 --> 02:18:00.479]  And ask him specifically why it was Congress wasn't, you know, consulted before Obama is going to strike Syria.
[02:18:00.619 --> 02:18:05.500]  And he had no, he had no reasonable explanation.
[02:18:05.520 --> 02:18:11.722]  He basically said, oh, well, the past few wars, Congress wasn't consulted.
[02:18:12.102 --> 02:18:17.603]  Yeah, so that's like saying if the cops busted a serial killer and he said, look, I killed 20 people.
[02:18:18.447 --> 02:18:19.587]  And now you caught me on the 21st?
[02:18:19.728 --> 02:18:21.188]  It's okay, because I did it before.
[02:18:21.528 --> 02:18:23.189]  They're saying precedent, exactly.
[02:18:24.970 --> 02:18:29.691]  Now we get our orders from NATO, not from the Bill of Rights and the Congress.
[02:18:30.692 --> 02:18:37.314]  Well, and the hypocrisy was handing out pocket constitutions at the front door.
[02:18:37.775 --> 02:18:39.295]  You know, it's just ridiculous.
[02:18:40.196 --> 02:18:40.656]  Well, that's...
[02:18:42.332 --> 02:18:43.813]  Packaging over reality.
[02:18:43.833 --> 02:18:45.093]  That's form over function.
[02:18:45.133 --> 02:18:46.474]  That's what they do.
[02:18:47.354 --> 02:18:51.715]  And a large portion of the public does not even know what planet they're on.
[02:18:52.256 --> 02:18:54.096]  And that's why the globalists are going ahead with this.
[02:18:54.156 --> 02:18:58.078]  But at a certain point, they just can't get away with everything.
[02:18:58.960 --> 02:18:59.801]  And I hear you.
[02:19:01.023 --> 02:19:07.951]  I wonder, you know, I'm confused because they're acting so erratically and now three days now Putin hasn't said a word.
[02:19:08.371 --> 02:19:10.394]  What do you think is going to happen?
[02:19:10.694 --> 02:19:12.917]  He's backing down and not saying anything now.
[02:19:14.155 --> 02:19:15.496]  Well, I'd like to know, what do you think?
[02:19:15.696 --> 02:19:16.757]  Well, I mean, here's the deal.
[02:19:17.018 --> 02:19:21.121]  Again, there is no Russia, there is no America, there is no England, there is no Japan.
[02:19:21.141 --> 02:19:26.807]  They're all run by less than 500 corporations that are bigger than governments and that are anti-free market.
[02:19:27.307 --> 02:19:30.410]  And they are sitting back, playing the countries off against each other.
[02:19:31.010 --> 02:19:34.033]  Russia is full of globalist corporations and other factions.
[02:19:34.574 --> 02:19:39.999]  And they may have even made a deal, and I'm not saying this has happened, but this is how it works, where they're going to let them have Syria.
[02:19:41.874 --> 02:19:45.055]  I mean, Russia could flip and totally join the New World Order completely tomorrow.
[02:19:46.535 --> 02:19:55.317]  That's like the globalists go in, as Dr. Roberts talked about a few days ago, and they hire all the communist officials in China to be corporate officials on their boards.
[02:19:56.378 --> 02:20:04.640]  See, it's a corporate infiltration, a corporate espionage, a corporate takeover, a financial world government.
[02:20:05.360 --> 02:20:08.721]  We'll be right back with more calls, and we're waiting for Obama's speech.
[02:20:10.967 --> 02:20:17.931]  There's a huge and hushed up conspiracy going on that's about to turn your lives upside down in the coming few months.
[02:20:18.491 --> 02:20:21.552]  Unbelievably, the media are keeping quiet about this.
[02:20:22.173 --> 02:20:27.996]  I'm sure they know it, but they probably know that revealing it on TV will generate mass hysteria and chaos.
[02:20:28.871 --> 02:20:39.397]  But I believe you should be informed about it, because when the sinister agenda is finally accomplished and everything unravels, only those who know this secret info will survive and thrive.
[02:20:40.097 --> 02:20:44.240]  Go to 123conspiracy.com right now to see the truth.
[02:20:44.980 --> 02:20:53.144]  The video at 123conspiracy.com reveals the real, secret reason why Obama is after your guns and ammo.
[02:20:53.664 --> 02:20:57.085]  And it's not just in response to mass murders or preparing for war.
[02:20:57.506 --> 02:20:59.466]  It's something much darker.

[02:22:39.164 --> 02:22:48.432]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[02:22:48.472 --> 02:22:49.212]  This capitalism?
[02:22:49.272 --> 02:22:55.397]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:22:55.437 --> 02:22:59.080]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[02:22:59.140 --> 02:23:00.061]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[02:23:00.081 --> 02:23:01.122]  It's time to understand the system.
[02:23:01.142 --> 02:23:01.402]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:23:01.462 --> 02:23:01.802]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:23:08.948 --> 02:23:13.072]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[02:23:13.732 --> 02:23:15.874]  I want you to know some very important information.
[02:23:16.755 --> 02:23:25.103]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[02:23:25.743 --> 02:23:30.648]  Now, 27 years later, carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[02:23:31.278 --> 02:23:42.251]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.
[02:23:42.651 --> 02:23:49.660]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[02:23:50.320 --> 02:23:54.602]  Call 1-866-VENUSFLY or order from carnivora.com.
[02:23:54.622 --> 02:23:57.784]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.
[02:23:58.224 --> 02:24:05.168]  That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VENUSFLY or visit carnivora.com.
[02:24:05.488 --> 02:24:06.468]  Protect your immune system.
[02:24:06.748 --> 02:24:07.789]  It's the only one you've got.
[02:24:10.182 --> 02:24:22.891]  Before you slip into unconsciousness, I'd like to have another chance.
[02:24:23.071 --> 02:24:25.653]  Obama is set to come on in a couple of minutes.
[02:24:25.813 --> 02:24:27.234]  That's what CNN says.
[02:24:27.274 --> 02:24:28.175]  Who knows what's true.
[02:24:29.076 --> 02:24:32.498]  And we will go to that as soon as that happens and get his announcement.
[02:24:32.798 --> 02:24:38.322]  It may just be more of a buildup or he may say, you know, you've got to leave us on or I'm going to hit you in 48 hours.
[02:24:38.382 --> 02:24:38.923]  I mean, who knows?
[02:24:40.029 --> 02:24:43.792]  We'll certainly find out soon, but you know Obama didn't make those decisions.
[02:24:43.832 --> 02:24:46.193]  The foreign banks that run this country did.
[02:24:47.374 --> 02:24:51.477]  Kurt Nimmo just put up an article, Kerry misrepresents Syria chemical war dead.
[02:24:51.497 --> 02:24:57.922]  I just walked into Kurt and I said, Kurt, that's a great article you wrote, but why don't we change the headline to what he originally was talking about having it.
[02:24:58.382 --> 02:25:04.827]  Kerry lies about the number of chemical war dead.
[02:25:05.748 --> 02:25:13.753]  And then have the sub-headline from the Doctors Without Borders that Doctors Without Borders said 300 to 400 children died, the number they say is 426, versus the 1,429.
[02:25:13.793 --> 02:25:14.153]  I mean, there it is.
[02:25:14.393 --> 02:25:16.394]  Their report, their new report that he's citing, says 426, not 1,429.
[02:25:16.434 --> 02:25:18.675]  In fact, he just basically put a 1...
[02:25:33.191 --> 02:25:34.913]  Another digit, a one in front of that.
[02:25:35.453 --> 02:25:37.636]  And again, that's all a lie too to begin with.
[02:25:37.716 --> 02:25:39.638]  I mean, it's just, it's incredible.
[02:25:40.619 --> 02:25:43.642]  It's incredible to be watching this, this happen.
[02:25:44.403 --> 02:25:45.324]  Kerry's out here.
[02:25:47.646 --> 02:25:49.789]  Oh, so now Kerry is correcting himself.
[02:25:54.873 --> 02:25:58.177]  So, we're going to be going over all of that.
[02:25:58.518 --> 02:26:01.602]  But the way he spun it was, he said 426 were children.
[02:26:05.370 --> 02:26:07.071]  Out of 1,429.
[02:26:07.131 --> 02:26:10.812]  But the report says that it's 400 and something.
[02:26:11.012 --> 02:26:14.153]  And that is even arguing about things that don't matter.
[02:26:14.373 --> 02:26:15.593]  The West started this.
[02:26:16.073 --> 02:26:19.434]  They've clearly been behind the false flags like Ron Paul said.
[02:26:19.734 --> 02:26:21.315]  It's not just Alex Jones saying this.
[02:26:21.375 --> 02:26:27.196]  I mean, I've got major newspapers like the Independent saying, does Obama know he's giving arms to Al Qaeda?
[02:26:27.537 --> 02:26:28.677]  Of course they know!
[02:26:30.537 --> 02:26:31.498]  It's like asking
[02:26:33.356 --> 02:26:38.864]  You know, John Wayne, when he was 70 years old, John Wayne, did you know you've starred in Westerns?
[02:26:39.004 --> 02:26:44.993]  I mean, it just beggars the mind of what they get away with.
[02:26:47.335 --> 02:26:51.757]  I mean, with Bush and the WMDs that came out, that was a certified premeditated fraud.
[02:26:52.397 --> 02:26:56.319]  But at least he went to Congress and the UN and they had some fake dossiers or something.
[02:26:56.919 --> 02:27:02.801]  Still, that set the precedent to invade anybody that has powerful weapons, saying only the globalists can have them.
[02:27:02.821 --> 02:27:04.882]  I mean, what a dangerous precedent that is.
[02:27:04.922 --> 02:27:07.203]  We know what the globalists want for this country.
[02:27:07.243 --> 02:27:08.184]  Is Obama coming out yet?
[02:27:08.204 --> 02:27:11.105]  Because they keep saying, a few minutes, a few minutes.
[02:27:11.585 --> 02:27:13.866]  And see how these narcissist imperial globalists
[02:27:15.134 --> 02:27:19.055]  Control our lives where we have to... Everything's about what are they going to do with interest rates?
[02:27:19.095 --> 02:27:20.676]  What are they going to do with the economy?
[02:27:20.716 --> 02:27:21.676]  What are they going to do with the war?
[02:27:21.976 --> 02:27:29.519]  In a free nation, in a free world, you're not supposed to be living moment to moment, heartbeat to heartbeat, breath to breath about what they're doing.
[02:27:31.080 --> 02:27:32.520]  They want to be the center of the universe.
[02:27:32.620 --> 02:27:34.021]  They want to control everything.
[02:27:34.801 --> 02:27:38.682]  Let's go to Zach in California and then we'll go to everybody else that's patiently holding.
[02:27:38.882 --> 02:27:40.343]  What's your take on this stuff, Zach?
[02:27:41.380 --> 02:27:43.782]  Hey, it's nice to talk to you Alex, first time caller.
[02:27:45.464 --> 02:27:59.936]  I think that all the double talk that Gary's doing coming back, he has to correct his previous statement, the way CNN had delayed the feed from the State Department to make sure that nothing's going on.
[02:28:00.697 --> 02:28:08.244]  It all shows that internally, the New World Order, these elitist bankers, they are fighting amongst each other.
[02:28:08.991 --> 02:28:19.815]  And I think that they're scrambling for scraps on the table right now, and they don't realize in their own arrogance that they are going to slit their own throats.
[02:28:23.077 --> 02:28:23.997]  What's your take on that?
[02:28:25.137 --> 02:28:27.618]  Look, I just think the whole thing is one giant mess.
[02:28:32.984 --> 02:28:35.465]  I think they don't know exactly what they're going to do.
[02:28:35.485 --> 02:28:36.965]  I mean, they may have just made the decision.
[02:28:37.225 --> 02:28:41.547]  They thought they could just sell this and play the part of heroes and launch their operation.
[02:28:41.907 --> 02:28:43.527]  What do you think about what you just said?
[02:28:44.308 --> 02:28:57.252]  Well, there was a comment a caller or guest made recently that said there is no real policy that every action that's taken outside of the state is a reaction to some kind of internal turmoil.
[02:28:58.072 --> 02:29:06.159]  And, um, I think that the fighting, that they're constantly, the way they push constantly in every corner, they're getting shut down.
[02:29:06.980 --> 02:29:11.563]  They cannot win for losing right now, and the approval rate of the U.S.
[02:29:11.644 --> 02:29:22.032]  people, um, and how sad that is, and, uh, the British government and how Parliament has been, you know, and the U.N.'
[02:29:22.012 --> 02:29:26.216]  's not allowing it, look at vetoes from Russia and China, but, um,
[02:29:27.063 --> 02:29:31.166]  I think these people have built an empire on sand and it's crumbling in front of them.
[02:29:31.566 --> 02:29:37.810]  And this is their most dangerous time because they're willing to do anything to make their...
[02:29:47.461 --> 02:29:51.125]  geopolitically see that the danger is there.
[02:29:51.145 --> 02:29:56.691]  I can close my eyes, you know, if I wasn't politically aware, and you can just feel the danger.
[02:29:56.711 --> 02:29:59.113]  We'll be back with more calls straight ahead.
[02:29:59.494 --> 02:30:02.477]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:30:03.418 --> 02:30:06.080]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:10.311 --> 02:30:13.932]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us?
[02:30:14.173 --> 02:30:19.455]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[02:30:19.695 --> 02:30:27.237]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[02:30:27.418 --> 02:30:36.521]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[02:30:36.721 --> 02:30:43.731]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[02:30:43.911 --> 02:30:46.755]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[02:30:46.775 --> 02:30:53.704]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse but demand a war.
[02:30:54.585 --> 02:30:55.205]  There's another one!
[02:30:55.245 --> 02:30:56.526]  Another plane just hit!
[02:31:10.566 --> 02:31:17.891]  Dozens of diseases ranging from the common cold and flu to MRSA and pneumonia are all caused by infectious pathogens.
[02:31:18.331 --> 02:31:22.134]  Fortunately, a simple, safe and effective alternative exists.
[02:31:22.574 --> 02:31:36.143]  Supernatural Silver is a new and vastly improved type of silver solution that is safe and extremely effective against 143 types of bacteria, both forms of viruses, mold and yeast, and a limited number of parasites.
[02:31:36.703 --> 02:31:38.625]  It can even purify water!

[02:33:17.782 --> 02:33:26.325]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:27.505 --> 02:33:40.649]  When our gracious, dear, wondrous leader decides to give his speech that they keep saying for 20 minutes is imminent any second, I will cut to that so we can play it live here for you.
[02:33:43.308 --> 02:33:57.877]  And I better call him the dear Excellency Supreme Leader because, well, if you're a rodeo clown and wear a mask and get chased by a bull, they say that's a threat to Obama and he's been fired and banned from the rodeo association in Missouri.
[02:33:59.678 --> 02:34:08.863]  And everybody else has to go take sensitivity training that works at the rodeo as a clown in a good authoritarian model because they're all guilty because he did something that wasn't illegal.
[02:34:10.544 --> 02:34:11.585]  Because you're in a free country.
[02:34:12.506 --> 02:34:13.687]  And they have truth squads there.
[02:34:15.268 --> 02:34:19.671]  Get the new issue of the magazine in bulk at cost to give to friends and family.
[02:34:20.651 --> 02:34:22.633]  It is the September edition.

[02:34:34.580 --> 02:34:37.462]  Great way to wake people up.
[02:34:37.562 --> 02:34:39.523]  InfoWarsTore.com
[02:34:42.273 --> 02:34:47.537]  All right, let's go ahead now and go back to your calls.
[02:34:47.597 --> 02:34:52.481]  Let's talk to, if this is spelled right, Mootica?
[02:34:53.222 --> 02:34:54.403]  Am I pronouncing that right?
[02:34:54.723 --> 02:34:55.724]  From Texas, go ahead.
[02:34:55.744 --> 02:34:58.146]  Mootica.
[02:34:58.566 --> 02:34:59.747]  Mootica Base Jigga.
[02:34:59.767 --> 02:35:00.528]  You know I dig ya.
[02:35:01.248 --> 02:35:04.711]  Anyway, I had a few things.
[02:35:05.472 --> 02:35:09.395]  It's the first time I've ever called you, but a few things.
[02:35:09.415 --> 02:35:11.557]  I'm a local Austin musician, but
[02:35:12.439 --> 02:35:24.289]  I heard this morning on the Power Hour, first of all, the only way to conquer this darkness is with the light and not to hide underneath a table.
[02:35:24.609 --> 02:35:34.177]  And tomorrow there's going to be an anti-war in Syria rally downtown, starting at 10 o'clock at the Capitol's grounds.
[02:35:34.858 --> 02:35:40.983]  So I encourage everyone to go down and rally against this.
[02:35:41.772 --> 02:35:42.392]  For one thing.
[02:35:42.752 --> 02:35:57.998]  For another thing, you know, there's several prophecies in the Bible that speak of this time very specifically, and it just all is them preparing for their false messiah and the greatest deception of peace that ever will come.
[02:35:58.078 --> 02:36:05.081]  So we need to wake up, America, and repent and get on our knees and stand for the truth.
[02:36:06.681 --> 02:36:07.461]  I agree with you.
[02:36:07.581 --> 02:36:15.245]  I agree this is shadows and the foretaste of biblical things in the future, but a lot of people are using that as a cop-out.
[02:36:15.545 --> 02:36:23.349]  They're saying Jesus is about to come back before it all happens, so when the Antichrist shows up, they're going to think he is the Christ, which is the great delusion they're given.
[02:36:24.450 --> 02:36:28.732]  But even if you don't believe in all that, this is dangerous for everybody.
[02:36:28.772 --> 02:36:29.552]  Good to hear from you.
[02:36:29.952 --> 02:36:31.073]  I appreciate you calling.
[02:36:31.713 --> 02:36:32.494]  You want to say something else?
[02:36:32.514 --> 02:36:32.794]  Go ahead.
[02:36:33.891 --> 02:36:49.282]  Yeah, just on a funny, or take it for what it's worth, weird kind of note, this morning on the Power Hour, this lady called in and she was talking about the numbers of the days of the year, and August 31st is the 243rd day, and if you divide that by 365 point whatever, 24356 whatever,
[02:36:57.114 --> 02:37:03.640]  It allegedly comes out to 666, so she thinks that on tomorrow there's going to be some kind of attack.
[02:37:03.861 --> 02:37:14.931]  But I would say, like, if that is at all true, that maybe it would be more like on their calendar, which the Sabbath and tomorrow would start today at 6, so maybe tonight at midnight.
[02:37:15.491 --> 02:37:16.432]  Well, I'll say this.
[02:37:16.512 --> 02:37:16.993]  I'll say this.
[02:37:17.073 --> 02:37:21.017]  I don't follow all the numerology, and I appreciate your call, but the globalists are into it.
[02:37:23.308 --> 02:37:24.689]  And they're always doing things.
[02:37:24.749 --> 02:37:25.829]  Yes, good to talk to you.
[02:37:25.849 --> 02:37:28.170]  We're going to move along now to Logan.
[02:37:28.570 --> 02:37:29.991]  Logan, you're on the air.
[02:37:30.171 --> 02:37:34.992]  You say you're a B-1B bomber technician.
[02:37:35.552 --> 02:37:40.814]  And I was hearing those are going to be retired, but then they've been flying them out east in one crash last week.
[02:37:41.254 --> 02:37:46.856]  What word do you have on B-1 bombers or B-2 bombers being moved into the European theater?
[02:37:48.476 --> 02:37:49.877]  Well, Alex, I can tell you that
[02:37:50.512 --> 02:37:54.034]  They've been saying for a long time they were going to get rid of the B-1.
[02:37:54.375 --> 02:37:58.417]  But time and time again, it proves to be one of the best bombers we actually have.
[02:37:58.738 --> 02:38:02.240]  It almost even outperforms the B-2, which is a much newer plane.
[02:38:02.922 --> 02:38:07.564]  I mean, the radar cross-sections are insanely small for such a huge plane.
[02:38:07.584 --> 02:38:09.685]  It goes ridiculously fast.
[02:38:09.725 --> 02:38:11.126]  I mean, it is faster than I tell you.
[02:38:11.166 --> 02:38:13.948]  You look up, it'll say it goes just above Mach 1.
[02:38:14.008 --> 02:38:15.088]  I can tell you that that's false.
[02:38:15.248 --> 02:38:16.549]  It goes much faster than that.
[02:38:16.789 --> 02:38:18.730]  Sure, real speeds are always classified.
[02:38:18.750 --> 02:38:23.833]  Like they say, aircraft carriers go 40 knots, and the word is some of them go 100, if you can believe it.
[02:38:24.153 --> 02:38:24.653]  But go ahead.
[02:38:24.673 --> 02:38:24.893]  Right.
[02:38:25.553 --> 02:38:26.294]  But I will tell you,
[02:38:26.974 --> 02:38:31.396]  They were going to close down the base I was working at a few years ago, and it comes up every so often.
[02:38:31.676 --> 02:38:34.897]  But they used us for Operation Odyssey Dawn, if you remember that one in Libya.
[02:38:35.797 --> 02:38:40.799]  Now, they flew directly from the continental United States over to Libya.
[02:38:41.219 --> 02:38:43.060]  Bomb came right back without landing.
[02:38:43.240 --> 02:38:44.020]  Unprecedented.
[02:38:44.280 --> 02:38:45.440]  I mean, that's a long flight.
[02:38:46.201 --> 02:38:47.381]  Outperformed everything.
[02:38:47.441 --> 02:38:48.621]  I mean, it was ridiculous.
[02:38:48.661 --> 02:38:53.003]  And after that, they realized, the brass said, this is a plane we need to use.
[02:38:53.959 --> 02:38:58.483]  The radar, you can't, you don't pick this thing up on radar unless they want you to see it.
[02:38:58.903 --> 02:38:59.944]  So that's what it comes down to.
[02:39:00.465 --> 02:39:02.226]  You cannot, I've worked the radar systems.
[02:39:02.306 --> 02:39:08.692]  They're, even for being seven, you know, from the 1970s, radar today has a lot of problems.
[02:39:09.012 --> 02:39:10.253]  They're still here in the 22s.
[02:39:10.653 --> 02:39:14.476]  Now is that because it doesn't really have a lot of stealth attributes like the B-2, right?
[02:39:14.537 --> 02:39:15.858]  It's because it flies low?
[02:39:15.878 --> 02:39:19.561]  Or are you saying it has stealth capabilities when it's flying high?
[02:39:23.852 --> 02:39:24.792]  It's all about radar.
[02:39:24.833 --> 02:39:28.454]  Just scrambling signals, you know, giving erroneous signals.
[02:39:28.474 --> 02:39:28.854]  Oh, I get it.
[02:39:28.874 --> 02:39:31.854]  You're saying it's got radar jammers on it and false signals.
[02:39:31.934 --> 02:39:32.815]  Okay, I get that, yeah.
[02:39:33.375 --> 02:39:36.696]  That's baby stuff compared to what this thing has.
[02:39:37.016 --> 02:39:38.776]  This thing can fry radar systems.
[02:39:40.677 --> 02:39:46.358]  Just flying around, it can fry other planes' radar systems, as long as it's close enough.
[02:39:47.139 --> 02:39:51.780]  And this thing is a power plant of just military ability.
[02:39:52.817 --> 02:39:56.038]  And if you have any other questions, I'd be happy to answer them.
[02:39:56.619 --> 02:39:57.999]  No, no, no, that's very interesting.
[02:39:58.059 --> 02:40:06.423]  I mean, what do you think about the word that they're all being moved to the, we don't know if they left the U.S., I'm sure they did, that they're being moved out to the East Coast, B-1s and B-2s?
[02:40:08.064 --> 02:40:11.425]  Well, they would move them down to the gang, the Georgia Air National Guard.
[02:40:11.465 --> 02:40:12.926]  That's where they run out of on the East Coast.
[02:40:12.986 --> 02:40:15.067]  I was in the middle of the continent.
[02:40:15.667 --> 02:40:16.728]  They would fly them out there.
[02:40:16.748 --> 02:40:21.970]  They'll fly them into one of the bases out there in the Middle East, probably in Iraq or Afghanistan.
[02:40:22.526 --> 02:40:34.774]  Do some quick maintenance on them, you know, tighten some bolts, some screws, and then fly them right out there, run them ops, run them right back before anyone could even button their pants up.
[02:40:35.054 --> 02:40:40.978]  They're quick, they're quiet, their payloads are very large compared to any other plane its size.
[02:40:40.998 --> 02:40:47.362]  Yeah, would they be using that to take out the military command in bunkers in Assad?
[02:40:47.382 --> 02:40:49.344]  I mean, it's either that or nukes, right?
[02:40:50.393 --> 02:40:52.795]  Oh yeah, this plane is nuclear capable.
[02:40:53.115 --> 02:41:00.281]  I mean, that's one, but yes, they could easily take out entire city, probably entire city blocks.
[02:41:00.341 --> 02:41:05.906]  If you had four or five of them, you could take out half a city with just one, maybe two passes.
[02:41:06.686 --> 02:41:10.930]  This thing is a very intense piece of equipment that people really don't know about.
[02:41:11.070 --> 02:41:13.352]  And I just heard you talking about it.
[02:41:13.372 --> 02:41:14.433]  I figured I'd give my input.
[02:41:15.441 --> 02:41:18.103]  Sure, I was just bumbling around with what I've seen on Discovery Channel and stuff.
[02:41:18.143 --> 02:41:27.150]  They had 4th of July before had one fly over with its wings out and then it turned over the city and started sweeping them back and turned on its afterburners and blasted off.
[02:41:27.590 --> 02:41:31.653]  It is a really neat looking plane, but it's in the hands of the New World Order.
[02:41:31.933 --> 02:41:33.014]  So I appreciate your call.
[02:41:33.034 --> 02:41:34.335]  We're still waiting for Obama.
[02:41:34.575 --> 02:41:35.296]  Is this Lordship?
[02:41:35.936 --> 02:41:38.118]  CNN's like Obama does speak in minutes.
[02:41:38.759 --> 02:41:41.561]  It's like Kerry this week spoke like 30 minutes after they said he was.
[02:41:42.001 --> 02:41:44.323]  We'll continue to track it all here live on the radio, folks.
[02:41:45.064 --> 02:41:47.366]  Mike in Canada, what's your take on the situation, sir?
[02:41:49.628 --> 02:41:50.829]  Yeah, Alex, how you doing?
[02:41:51.029 --> 02:41:51.389]  Pretty good.
[02:41:53.251 --> 02:41:56.594]  It's my first time calling.
[02:41:56.614 --> 02:41:58.215]  Well, thank you for calling.
[02:41:58.255 --> 02:41:59.556]  Talk right into your telephone for me.
[02:42:00.697 --> 02:42:01.018]  I am.
[02:42:01.658 --> 02:42:02.719]  Okay, can you hear me better now?
[02:42:02.899 --> 02:42:03.480]  Yes, sir, go ahead.
[02:42:04.560 --> 02:42:16.308]  Okay, my question is, is there any way the military can actually, like, stand down on their own without, you know, just going out there and killing people just like that?
[02:42:16.328 --> 02:42:20.050]  Like, I used to think that people should have morals.
[02:42:20.891 --> 02:42:29.216]  You know, like, when they say, go do something and you see that it's not right, you should be able to say, okay, you know what, at least ask questions or something.
[02:42:29.236 --> 02:42:33.859]  Because all indication is saying that this is a false flag.
[02:42:34.804 --> 02:42:36.305]  Ron Paul came out and said it.
[02:42:36.345 --> 02:42:40.888]  There's a bunch of videos on YouTube pointing out that it is not right to go into Syria.
[02:42:41.728 --> 02:42:43.469]  And still they're pushing forward for that.
[02:42:44.390 --> 02:42:51.414]  And it's because they need a political diversion and they want to take over every sovereign nation, whether that country be good, bad, or indifferent.
[02:42:51.855 --> 02:42:53.015]  And I appreciate your calls, sir.
[02:42:53.095 --> 02:42:53.896]  Great question.
[02:42:56.457 --> 02:42:59.319]  Morally, the soldiers... I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:43:00.540 --> 02:43:00.840]  Okay.
[02:43:01.461 --> 02:43:03.742]  And... I'm just thinking.
[02:43:04.514 --> 02:43:10.320]  Because really, I think the Congress has to give the authority for them to go into war.
[02:43:11.001 --> 02:43:12.883]  And if they don't get that authority...
[02:43:13.536 --> 02:43:13.977]  I don't think so.
[02:43:36.079 --> 02:43:40.500]  When you hear like 10 people died, it's like you get this cold chills down your spine.
[02:43:40.540 --> 02:43:42.441]  Like 10 people just lost their lives.
[02:43:42.761 --> 02:43:45.521]  Now you can hear like a thousand people just died yesterday.
[02:43:45.621 --> 02:43:46.102]  That's right.
[02:43:46.362 --> 02:43:46.782]  Nothing.
[02:43:46.902 --> 02:43:48.622]  Folks have been desensitized.
[02:43:49.182 --> 02:43:51.183]  They've been desensitized.
[02:43:51.423 --> 02:43:53.043]  It's normal now.
[02:43:53.703 --> 02:43:59.345]  And that is why the military, these are individuals, like these are young kids, like 21, 22.
[02:43:59.765 --> 02:44:02.946]  And they are going in there to hurt people.
[02:44:05.705 --> 02:44:14.750]  I have a family member in the Marines stationed in Afghanistan right now, and I usually ask him, what do you think, I mean, when you go out there, how do you feel?
[02:44:14.770 --> 02:44:20.114]  And he's basically like, everybody just have the same feeling, like,
[02:44:21.054 --> 02:44:23.315]  Mike, I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[02:44:23.335 --> 02:44:23.955]  Thank you so much.
[02:44:23.975 --> 02:44:26.995]  Again, the point you make is central to everything.
[02:44:50.663 --> 02:44:57.345]  The military is compartmentalized and they're given these manuals to follow the Constitution, the Bill of Rights that explain their duties.
[02:44:58.765 --> 02:45:02.246]  And up until really even the 80s it said don't follow illegal orders.
[02:45:02.666 --> 02:45:03.506]  Here are examples.
[02:45:03.966 --> 02:45:05.507]  They don't really have those anymore.
[02:45:06.047 --> 02:45:07.987]  Or they have more like a synopsis.
[02:45:08.067 --> 02:45:11.648]  Instead the manuals are all about how George Washington's bad.
[02:45:11.708 --> 02:45:13.368]  I'm not joking if you're a new listener.
[02:45:14.149 --> 02:45:15.269]  This came out last weekend.
[02:45:16.727 --> 02:45:21.430]  If you're a gun owner, if you believe in small government, or want to make the world a better place.
[02:45:21.490 --> 02:45:22.050]  That's a quote.
[02:45:22.551 --> 02:45:23.131]  That's a quote.
[02:45:23.471 --> 02:45:24.152]  I'm not joking.
[02:45:24.192 --> 02:45:26.313]  This sounds, this sounds absurdist.
[02:45:26.393 --> 02:45:28.434]  It sounds like I'm being satirical.
[02:45:28.554 --> 02:45:28.935]  I'm not.
[02:45:30.976 --> 02:45:32.117]  That you're a bad person.
[02:45:33.055 --> 02:45:35.957]  And they do that to find out if you're a good person so they can drum you out.
[02:45:35.977 --> 02:45:37.258]  So they can get rid of you.
[02:45:37.458 --> 02:45:43.182]  They want either really stupid people or psychopathic people or mercenary types that'll do whatever they're told.
[02:45:43.462 --> 02:45:51.447]  They want that across the board and they feel like they're part of the winning team and love the status and the glitz, they believe, and the sexiness of being an enforcer.
[02:45:51.827 --> 02:45:52.148]  Okay?
[02:45:53.388 --> 02:46:00.053]  Whether you're a corporate enforcer or a police enforcer, whatever the case is, that's what they're converting over to in a propaganda state.
[02:46:01.795 --> 02:46:04.557]  An absolute, total propaganda state.
[02:46:22.208 --> 02:46:25.969]  All the major doctors said, this is killing people and giving them epilepsy.
[02:46:26.509 --> 02:46:27.429]  This is really dangerous.
[02:46:27.469 --> 02:46:31.151]  Whatever's in this Porton Down anthrax shot, we're not giving it.
[02:46:31.631 --> 02:46:33.691]  And they started court-martialing a bunch of them.
[02:46:33.891 --> 02:46:35.192]  They said, good, court-martial me.
[02:46:35.932 --> 02:46:36.652]  It all came out.
[02:46:36.692 --> 02:46:37.512]  They had to back off.
[02:46:38.012 --> 02:46:38.973]  Then they tried it again.
[02:46:39.153 --> 02:46:40.133]  More people stood up.
[02:46:40.573 --> 02:46:41.513]  They had to back off again.
[02:46:41.533 --> 02:46:45.775]  This happened a couple times since about 2000.
[02:46:46.255 --> 02:46:48.495]  So I guess 13 years or so.
[02:46:48.555 --> 02:46:49.616]  And it happened previous to that, too.
[02:46:49.636 --> 02:46:50.436]  So I guess it's three times.
[02:46:51.767 --> 02:47:02.817]  So they had to say no, they had to, the court-martial got started, and then the doctors in the army in that case, there was also some Air Force doctors, they then got still kicked out but with an honorable discharge.
[02:47:03.998 --> 02:47:05.419]  But they saved a lot of people.
[02:47:06.380 --> 02:47:17.851]  That's because they were the experts, they medically saw what it was doing, they didn't like hurting their fellow members of the military and fellow Americans, they said no, they said fine, go ahead and court-martial us, the system had to back off.
[02:47:19.085 --> 02:47:35.350]  Same thing happened in 2002 with the smallpox shot that was causing an autoimmune response and people would have like an asthmatic event who never had it and would turn blue and pass out and you'd have to be, you know, basically traked to be able to live.
[02:47:36.272 --> 02:47:40.653]  Also, others would have a heart attack, would cause an autoimmune response in the heart, in the ventricles.
[02:47:40.773 --> 02:47:44.374]  Remember, a couple reporters took it and had heart attacks and died.
[02:47:44.694 --> 02:47:45.215]  Young people.
[02:47:45.775 --> 02:47:47.275]  I mean, this is a big deal, folks.
[02:47:48.516 --> 02:47:51.977]  And it wasn't just a regular smallpox batch from the 70s.
[02:47:52.017 --> 02:47:53.317]  It was something really weird.
[02:47:55.066 --> 02:47:57.728]  And you're saying, what does this have to do with following orders on a war?
[02:47:58.528 --> 02:48:01.310]  You've got to just say no, but people have been taught.
[02:48:01.330 --> 02:48:07.875]  I heard the Austin Police Chief, Arte Severo, who I want to get back on here, this morning on 590 AM, our local affiliate.
[02:48:09.296 --> 02:48:14.399]  I heard him say, word for word, the Austin Police 100% of the time do nothing wrong.
[02:48:15.460 --> 02:48:23.025]  This is a quote, they're all good, and you better do what they say, even if the order's wrong, or you may be killed.
[02:48:24.414 --> 02:48:37.720]  Now under common law, Bill of Rights, Constitution, all the court rulings, it's on record that if a cop comes to your house to try to beat your brains out for no reason or rape you or pull over your daughter and make her have sex with you, there's all these famous cases.
[02:48:38.560 --> 02:48:42.622]  Sitting outside a topless bar, pulling over women, saying I'm taking you to jail for drunk driving if you don't have sex with me.
[02:48:42.882 --> 02:48:46.224]  Those cases are all famous, including in Austin, where I live.
[02:48:46.724 --> 02:48:48.945]  And here's the police chief who comes off real slick
[02:48:50.086 --> 02:48:52.267]  He had to be trained in propaganda to say this.
[02:48:52.848 --> 02:48:56.251]  Our police officers 100% of the time are good.
[02:48:56.271 --> 02:49:01.735]  100% of the time if they shoot someone with deadly force, it's because they didn't follow an order.
[02:49:02.336 --> 02:49:05.338]  And whether that order is right or wrong, you better follow it.
[02:49:05.358 --> 02:49:07.600]  It was like a death threat on air to everybody.
[02:49:08.020 --> 02:49:08.941]  It was chilling.
[02:49:10.382 --> 02:49:10.983]  It was like...
[02:49:14.865 --> 02:49:17.286]  8-10 this morning, him and Sergeant Sam were on there.
[02:49:17.566 --> 02:49:19.047]  In fact, we need to call them and get that.
[02:49:19.067 --> 02:49:19.628]  They're nice folks.
[02:49:19.648 --> 02:49:20.208]  They'll give it to us.
[02:49:20.568 --> 02:49:23.950]  And I'm not trying to go after the police chief here.
[02:49:24.470 --> 02:49:25.771]  I don't think he's an evil person.
[02:49:25.791 --> 02:49:28.493]  His dad was a famous anti-communist, gun runner.
[02:49:29.433 --> 02:49:31.034]  We know who he worked for then.
[02:49:31.855 --> 02:49:33.496]  Clearly, probably an intelligence agency.
[02:49:33.736 --> 02:49:34.376]  I don't know this.
[02:49:34.396 --> 02:49:35.597]  Next time I have him in, I'm going to ask him.
[02:49:35.797 --> 02:49:37.258]  But I've looked more into Ace Veda.
[02:49:38.192 --> 02:49:42.135]  And the guy's come from nowhere to be the police chief over the 10th largest city in the US.
[02:49:42.395 --> 02:49:44.157]  It was 11th, it's set to be number 10.
[02:49:44.757 --> 02:49:47.259]  And I mean, and I'm listening to this, I'm like, man, this is psyops!
[02:49:47.840 --> 02:49:52.263]  There's no doubt, all that slick talk and that charm stuff, I'm calling him out.
[02:49:52.964 --> 02:49:54.065]  I don't think he's a communist.
[02:49:54.085 --> 02:49:56.066]  He got mad when I said that earlier, he got to move back to Cuba.
[02:49:57.107 --> 02:49:59.329]  He is some type of psyop guy.
[02:49:59.349 --> 02:50:06.034]  Because I'm listening to this, and the way he's delivering it was really slick, but really creepy.
[02:50:07.449 --> 02:50:09.330]  Because, again, I don't want to just hate the Austin police.
[02:50:09.450 --> 02:50:13.773]  On average, they have been a better police force, statistically, than what I've seen in many other forces.
[02:50:15.734 --> 02:50:22.658]  But as the city gets bigger, and as pressures get bigger, and as federal training comes in, man, they're killing people all the time.
[02:50:22.698 --> 02:50:23.778]  They're acting like crazy people.
[02:50:24.098 --> 02:50:27.981]  Some of the special units they've got are thugs, are creepy.
[02:50:29.482 --> 02:50:37.086]  And to say 100% of our officers are good people, and they always use lethal force properly, I mean, anybody knows that's bull.
[02:50:38.328 --> 02:50:47.111]  I mean, I'll guarantee if I was a cop, and I've got a lot of restraint myself in my life, I'll guarantee I'd probably go, you know, I don't want that job.
[02:50:47.372 --> 02:50:48.212]  I shouldn't be a cop.
[02:50:49.252 --> 02:50:55.915]  I'll tell you right now, I don't want to deal with some drunk lady and, you know, domestic dispute and people fighting with each other and stuff.
[02:50:55.935 --> 02:51:00.897]  I'd probably get, I mean, you know, the whole point is don't sit there and say that
[02:51:02.088 --> 02:51:05.650]  That the Austin Police Department is 100% perfect.
[02:51:05.990 --> 02:51:08.391]  I mean, that is literal baloney.
[02:51:08.631 --> 02:51:09.111]  We'll be back.
[02:51:10.232 --> 02:51:12.332]  Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins.
[02:51:12.593 --> 02:51:18.855]  Amino acids have to be delivered to your body in the shape that nature gave them, if they are to be used to create new proteins in your body.
[02:51:19.215 --> 02:51:27.219]  Just like a bricklayer cannot use bent or twisted bricks to build a brick wall, so too your body cannot use bent or twisted amino acids to build new proteins.
[02:51:27.719 --> 02:51:31.840]  Giving your body an undamaged amino acid food can make a huge difference in your health.
[02:51:32.500 --> 02:51:36.361]  One World Way is an undamaged amino acid food unlike any other.
[02:51:36.641 --> 02:51:38.942]  You see, heating bends and twists amino acids.
[02:51:39.202 --> 02:51:44.403]  And all whey protein powders we've investigated, and most proteins you consume, are heated.
[02:51:44.763 --> 02:51:48.264]  With our TrueCool process, you now have a choice with One World Way.
[02:51:48.664 --> 02:51:49.565]  My name is Daniel.
[02:51:49.705 --> 02:51:50.865]  I'm 34 years old.
[02:51:50.905 --> 02:51:54.627]  When I started using One World Way, I weighed 228 pounds.
[02:51:54.867 --> 02:51:58.429]  Now, after two and a half months, I weigh 182 pounds.
[02:51:58.569 --> 02:51:59.710]  This is my ideal weight.
[02:51:59.870 --> 02:52:04.612]  I've noticed an increase in stamina, rate of recovery from workouts, and an increase in my potency.
[02:52:04.852 --> 02:52:06.393]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit oneworldway.com
[02:52:10.055 --> 02:52:11.696]  Introducing Pro-1.

[02:52:15.598 --> 02:52:20.001]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[02:52:20.141 --> 02:52:26.124]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[02:52:26.244 --> 02:52:37.030]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.
[02:52:37.230 --> 02:52:43.537]  It is the only one that does it, and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[02:52:43.717 --> 02:52:58.452]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands.
[02:52:58.672 --> 02:53:00.694]  And sodium hexafluorosilicate.

[02:53:10.854 --> 02:53:12.914]  Mike Stenerson from Midas Resources.
[02:53:13.134 --> 02:53:16.275]  At no time in history have precious metals been more important.
[02:53:16.455 --> 02:53:18.936]  Certainly not in my 22 years in the industry.
[02:53:19.196 --> 02:53:22.856]  The dollar has lost over 90% of its value in the last 60 years.
[02:53:23.157 --> 02:53:26.617]  No fiat currency has ever survived the government printing presses.
[02:53:26.897 --> 02:53:27.978]  Ours is not immune.
[02:53:28.318 --> 02:53:29.938]  The time is now to be proactive.
[02:53:29.958 --> 02:53:30.518]  1-800-686-2237 extension 116.
[02:53:35.279 --> 02:53:37.621]  Anything tied to the dollar is at risk.
[02:53:38.001 --> 02:53:43.364]  CDs, annuities, 401Ks, IRAs, stocks, bonds, you name it, so decide.
[02:53:43.605 --> 02:53:46.707]  Do you want to leave a legacy of wealth or debt for your family?
[02:53:46.927 --> 02:53:47.907]  The choice is yours.
[02:53:48.228 --> 02:53:49.348]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237 extension 116.
[02:53:49.388 --> 02:53:50.349]  That's 1-800-686-2237 extension 116.
[02:53:50.469 --> 02:53:51.450]  Be proactive, not reactive.
[02:53:51.470 --> 02:53:51.650]  Call 1-800-686-2237
[02:54:05.522 --> 02:54:06.046]  Extension 116.
[02:54:20.714 --> 02:54:22.977]  Well, CNN did just delay it again.
[02:54:23.077 --> 02:54:28.505]  They taped it, as it says, moments ago, and then just aired it minutes ago.
[02:54:28.985 --> 02:54:35.554]  So here is Obama's bumbling statement from a roundtable meeting with some foreign leaders.
[02:54:35.614 --> 02:54:36.035]  Here it is.
[02:54:36.055 --> 02:54:38.017]  Obviously, I'm very grateful to have
[02:54:38.638 --> 02:54:40.639]  I have high confidence you did it, scumbag.
[02:54:40.659 --> 02:54:41.739]  So does Ron Paul.
[02:55:08.942 --> 02:55:11.494]  This kind of attack is a challenge to the world.
[02:55:12.828 --> 02:55:20.510]  We cannot accept a world where women and children and innocent civilians are gassed on a terrible scale.
[02:55:20.530 --> 02:55:25.571]  They cannot accept a world... This kind of attack threatens our national security interests.
[02:55:26.131 --> 02:55:28.012]  Because you started the war, you probably did it.
[02:55:28.132 --> 02:55:29.952]  Man, I'm sick of these people!
[02:55:30.333 --> 02:55:32.693]  They're such old BSers.
[02:55:32.973 --> 02:55:39.315]  By further threatening our friends and allies of ours in the region like Israel and Turkey and Jordan.
[02:55:40.435 --> 02:55:47.820]  And it increases the risk that chemical weapons will be used in the future and fall into the hands of terrorists who might use them against us.
[02:55:47.840 --> 02:55:49.561]  Is that noise in there?
[02:55:49.621 --> 02:56:03.789]  So, I have said before, and I meant what I said, that the world has an obligation to make sure that we maintain the norm against the use of chemical weapons.
[02:56:05.090 --> 02:56:13.896]  I have not made a final decision about various actions that might be taken to help enforce that norm.
[02:56:14.416 --> 02:56:16.498]  I have had my military
[02:56:19.920 --> 02:56:23.423]  My military.
[02:56:23.543 --> 02:56:24.423]  My military.
[02:56:24.784 --> 02:56:31.268]  An anti-gun, anti-God, anti-American, anti-free speech, piece of trash.
[02:56:31.789 --> 02:56:32.849]  It's his military.
[02:56:32.969 --> 02:56:36.452]  Yeah, because Congress didn't consult it, I guess it is.
[02:56:36.612 --> 02:56:37.372]  I guess it is!
[02:56:37.392 --> 02:56:40.154]  And MSNBC says your kids belong to them too.
[02:56:50.021 --> 02:57:03.952]  Okay, so they're looking to do an aspirin factory bombing, like Obama would do when Drugs Report exposed what he was doing with his cigars.
[02:57:04.733 --> 02:57:12.179]  So, you know, Clinton gets caught doing stuff with cigars, you gotta kill a bunch of people in a factory making aspirin.
[02:57:13.160 --> 02:57:16.702]  Or blow up some Iraqis, he did that too in Operation Fox, whatever it was.
[02:57:17.603 --> 02:57:18.264]  Commitment.
[02:57:18.644 --> 02:57:21.066]  We're not considering any boots on the ground approach.
[02:57:21.086 --> 02:57:22.707]  Chicago mobster runs America.
[02:57:22.727 --> 02:57:27.991]  What we need to do is consider options that meet the narrow concern around chemical weapons.
[02:57:28.051 --> 02:57:29.472]  Oh, the narrow concern.
[02:57:29.492 --> 02:57:30.473]  This is small.
[02:57:30.553 --> 02:57:31.294]  It's no big deal.
[02:57:31.554 --> 02:57:37.058]  A solely military solution to the underlying conflict and tragedy that's taking place in Syria.
[02:57:37.078 --> 02:57:38.319]  That you started with Brzezinski?
[02:57:38.339 --> 02:57:42.743]  This is the guy who's the front man for the people that started this civil war.
[02:57:45.544 --> 02:57:51.005]  And he sits up there, after he and his team did this, grandstanding!
[02:57:51.425 --> 02:57:59.246]  I mean, how much more bull do I have to take?
[02:57:59.306 --> 02:58:01.107]  Why do they always delay everything they do now?
[02:58:01.127 --> 02:58:03.327]  In case he, like, turns into a vampire or something?
[02:58:03.507 --> 02:58:09.988]  Because, you know, I already said WASP live underneath the UN building, according to MSNBC.
[02:58:10.208 --> 02:58:12.289]  I never said that, but might as well.
[02:58:14.189 --> 02:58:15.310]  I mean, look at these idiots.
[02:58:15.410 --> 02:58:17.232]  Look at this moron next to us.
[02:58:17.352 --> 02:58:22.236]  All a bunch of narcissistic control freak scum who'd love to destroy the planet if they could.
[02:58:22.316 --> 02:58:24.138]  I mean, look at the war criminal.
[02:58:24.238 --> 02:58:25.879]  Alright, that's enough of that idiot.
[02:58:25.899 --> 02:58:26.400]  Oh my goodness.
[02:58:32.594 --> 02:58:33.855]  I got loaded phone lines here.
[02:58:34.256 --> 02:58:35.777]  But look, I gotta stop the show.
[02:58:35.817 --> 02:58:36.758]  I can't go into overdrive.
[02:58:37.158 --> 02:58:38.860]  Call me back Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:58:38.880 --> 02:58:39.781]  We'll have the Monday show.
[02:58:40.061 --> 02:58:41.502]  Whatever happens, we'll be covering it.
[02:58:42.143 --> 02:58:45.786]  Oh, we got a special interview I'm taping today with a pretty interesting person.
[02:58:45.806 --> 02:58:46.587]  I'll just leave it at that.
[02:58:46.947 --> 02:58:47.608]  Look for that.
[02:58:47.788 --> 02:58:49.049]  Look for that next time we're live.
[02:58:49.069 --> 02:58:53.433]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:55.135 --> 02:58:57.237]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:59:00.475 --> 02:59:03.239]  Protecting your home with a security system is a must.
[02:59:03.459 --> 02:59:09.508]  But when it comes to protecting your family, your home, and belongings, there's no need to sign a long-term contract.
[02:59:09.848 --> 02:59:16.237]  Listen, there is some real scum in the alarm business cashing in by locking you into long, punishing contracts.
