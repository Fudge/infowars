[00:00:03.442 --> 00:00:08.281]  You're listening to GZN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:15.322 --> 00:00:19.524]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:20.165 --> 00:00:20.985]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.746 --> 00:00:22.666]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:23.287 --> 00:00:26.909]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:31.551]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:47.768 --> 00:00:54.993]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on another live, worldwide edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:55.013 --> 00:00:56.834]  And it is Friday.
[00:00:56.954 --> 00:00:58.875]  I mean, weeks now go by like minutes.
[00:00:59.536 --> 00:01:14.325]  And we're going to have open phones on Obamacare, on the state of the world, the state of the awakening that's taking place, but also there's not just those that are waking up, there's those that are buying into anything and everything.
[00:01:14.465 --> 00:01:16.847]  And psychologically, what we're seeing happen here
[00:01:18.516 --> 00:01:22.940]  Is the social engineers are really rolling out their paradigm of control.
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.783]  Of authoritarianism masquerading as political correctness.
[00:01:28.184 --> 00:01:30.066]  And so we have a lot of examples of that today.
[00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:32.528]  Huge NSA developments and news.
[00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:36.491]  We'll give you the story behind the story, the news behind the news on that.
[00:01:36.992 --> 00:01:42.717]  A bunch of key economic numbers and Obamacare facts coming out and some really good news.
[00:01:43.888 --> 00:01:46.349]  Why we fight, why we stand up, why we get involved.
[00:01:47.610 --> 00:02:04.637]  The psych warfare folks out there have some memes that they put out as talking points in the corporate state-run media that have been picked up by the general public that, oh, you're always saying we're in a police state, or you're always saying, you know, there's great tyrannies around the corner.
[00:02:04.877 --> 00:02:05.837]  Why don't you shut up?
[00:02:06.337 --> 00:02:07.078]  It isn't that bad.
[00:02:07.818 --> 00:02:09.779]  Whereas we hold back a lot of it.
[00:02:10.908 --> 00:02:19.894]  And so then they say, oh, it's not as bad as you say, or all these horrible things didn't happen because we're fighting them off at every front.
[00:02:21.636 --> 00:02:39.969]  When you stand up against the authoritarianism of saying your child can't come on the last day of school before Halloween dressed like a cowboy or as an Indian, and when you point out that's political correctness and mind control, you are stopping their cultural tyranny.
[00:02:40.885 --> 00:02:48.988]  When you don't roll over to Agenda 21, taking over your local town with international regulations and money, you are fighting on the front lines of human liberty.
[00:02:49.348 --> 00:02:51.689]  When you defend the Second Amendment, you're having a victory.
[00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:53.749]  And it's an eternal fight.
[00:02:53.809 --> 00:03:02.192]  You've got to do it over and over and over and over again.
[00:03:04.107 --> 00:03:05.247]  So that's what it comes down to.
[00:03:05.307 --> 00:03:08.848]  And here's another example of a victory against tyranny.
[00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:12.729]  It's up on Infowars.com right now.
[00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.811]  Army halts program that labeled Christians radical extremists.
[00:03:20.252 --> 00:03:21.592]  Briefings characterized
[00:03:25.322 --> 00:03:27.143]  Conservatives as a terror threat.
[00:03:27.163 --> 00:03:33.048]  Well, again, you cannot come up with a headline as bad as these manuals actually are.
[00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:40.434]  It says you'll be arrested and court-martialed if you give money to any Tea Party group, all legal and lawful.
[00:03:42.051 --> 00:03:48.816]  And it says you'll be arrested if you're part of a Tea Party or an Evangelical Christian group.
[00:03:49.556 --> 00:03:52.638]  Evangelicals are the second or third largest group.
[00:03:52.678 --> 00:03:53.479]  You can debate that.
[00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:54.299]  I looked up the numbers.
[00:03:54.779 --> 00:03:56.921]  They're the second or third largest Christian group.
[00:03:57.301 --> 00:03:59.923]  Eighty percent of Americans characterize themselves as Christians.
[00:04:00.743 --> 00:04:02.865]  You're talking about 40 to 60 to 70.
[00:04:03.345 --> 00:04:04.446]  No one knows the actual numbers.
[00:04:05.006 --> 00:04:08.809]  Over 40 million people who are the most law-abiding, loving,
[00:04:10.051 --> 00:04:11.131]  Good people on average.
[00:04:11.171 --> 00:04:12.032]  No one denies that.
[00:04:14.953 --> 00:04:18.394]  And they're saying they're bad people and you'll be arrested.
[00:04:19.495 --> 00:04:21.735]  This is 200 proof tyranny.
[00:04:22.576 --> 00:04:25.177]  This is the essence over the top.
[00:04:25.637 --> 00:04:28.538]  I mean all they can do after this is start arresting Christians.
[00:04:29.798 --> 00:04:33.880]  That's all they can do is go back to Rome throwing us to the lions.
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.241]  It is maximum evil.
[00:04:37.563 --> 00:04:39.024]  And it's totally naked.
[00:04:39.484 --> 00:04:42.345]  But the good news is, they tried this nationwide.
[00:04:42.485 --> 00:04:43.626]  Now they're gonna have to back off.
[00:04:43.846 --> 00:04:44.667]  But we're not gonna stop.
[00:04:44.707 --> 00:04:45.727]  We want investigations.
[00:04:45.947 --> 00:04:47.188]  We want congressional hearings.
[00:04:48.424 --> 00:04:58.050]  We're going to use their offensive to try to sneak in and get ready for a purge of Christians, and we're going to shoot it right back in their face like judo, and throw them right through the political wall.
[00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:59.351]  They came to attack us?
[00:04:59.751 --> 00:05:06.616]  We're going to step aside, stick our foot out, and trip them, and watch them go right down the stairs to break their political necks.
[00:05:06.996 --> 00:05:08.237]  That's info war!
[00:05:11.078 --> 00:05:16.160]  Alex Jones here, and I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show, My Patriot Supply.
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:25.002]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[00:05:25.422 --> 00:05:32.725]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow Patriots.
[00:05:33.245 --> 00:05:40.647]  My Patriot Supply brings us their exclusive Patriot Pantry brand, along with many other fine preparedness products.
[00:05:41.147 --> 00:05:44.548]  I personally store and use their high-quality products.
[00:05:45.108 --> 00:05:48.728]  It tastes great, and it's easy to store for up to 25 years.
[00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:55.870]  For a limited time, you can save $50 instantly on a four-week supply of food, along with other special offers.
[00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:03.151]  Visit mypatriotsupply.com forward slash Alex today, with the New World Order making rapid advances on every front.
[00:06:03.631 --> 00:06:07.672]  It is essential to prepare with My Patriot Supply today.
[00:06:10.592 --> 00:06:16.037]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:06:17.258 --> 00:06:22.022]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:06:22.402 --> 00:06:29.188]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:33.311]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:06:35.193 --> 00:06:37.475]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:06:39.622 --> 00:06:43.485]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[00:06:44.206 --> 00:06:47.308]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[00:06:48.049 --> 00:06:48.890]  Others don't.
[00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:51.171]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:06:51.432 --> 00:06:52.933]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[00:06:53.213 --> 00:06:55.775]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:06:56.095 --> 00:07:02.340]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:07:02.721 --> 00:07:04.923]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:07:05.423 --> 00:07:07.465]  Diamond gusset jeans got it.
[00:07:07.805 --> 00:07:08.666]  Others don't.
[00:07:09.761 --> 00:07:18.384]  Financial experts are certain that within 12 to 36 months, the American economy will collapse, pushing most Americans into terrifying poverty, like third-world slums.
[00:07:18.544 --> 00:07:30.768]  Facing this unstoppable horror and knowing so many are unprepared, a group of military vets, engineers, survival experts, and a former FDIC bank inspector pooled their knowledge and experience to create LocustsontheHorizon.com.
[00:07:30.968 --> 00:07:33.209]  Locusts on the Horizon is a book over 1,100 pages in length.
[00:07:34.369 --> 00:07:36.611]  Which many are now calling one of the best of its kind.
[00:07:36.871 --> 00:07:40.454]  And this book can save families from the worst an economic collapse can bring.
[00:07:40.694 --> 00:07:42.476]  The lives of your family are priceless.
[00:07:42.636 --> 00:07:44.898]  And you can start your plan to save them today for only $4.99.
[00:07:45.198 --> 00:07:48.681]  Not many preppers can actually afford a survival retreat.
[00:07:48.741 --> 00:07:52.544]  But virtually anyone can afford to implement the plan of Locusts on the Horizon.
[00:07:52.824 --> 00:07:55.587]  Locusts on the Horizon is available now for only $4.99 on Amazon.com.
[00:07:57.208 --> 00:08:00.791]  And it's readable with free software on any computer, tablet, or smartphone.
[00:08:00.991 --> 00:08:02.152]  Your time is running out.
[00:08:02.232 --> 00:08:04.033]  To not prepare would be suicide.
[00:08:04.273 --> 00:08:06.815]  Prepare now at locustsonthehorizon.com.
[00:08:06.915 --> 00:08:09.077]  That's locustsonthehorizon.com.
[00:08:27.478 --> 00:08:33.541]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[00:08:33.981 --> 00:08:35.502]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:37.362 --> 00:08:43.665]  I am sworn, as Thomas Jefferson did, to defend basic liberty.
[00:08:44.086 --> 00:08:51.529]  I have sworn on the altar of God, eternal resistance against every form of tyranny, over the mind of man.
[00:08:52.984 --> 00:08:57.427]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this Friday Worldwide Transmission.
[00:08:57.587 --> 00:09:06.234]  Any subject you want to talk about, any issue you want to cover, any question, any comment, you agree with me, you disagree with me, it doesn't matter.
[00:09:06.734 --> 00:09:10.957]  We want to hear from you on this Friday edition.
[00:09:11.037 --> 00:09:13.719]  Wide open phones the entire three hours, 800-259-9231.
[00:09:13.739 --> 00:09:13.779]  800-259-9231.
[00:09:24.091 --> 00:09:30.957]  I am a testimony to what you can do fighting against tyranny incrementally over time.
[00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:33.690]  Like the water torture example.
[00:09:34.591 --> 00:09:35.531]  The globalists know this.
[00:09:35.571 --> 00:09:38.772]  They do things over time, always pushing, never giving up.
[00:09:38.832 --> 00:09:41.032]  When they're defeated, regrouping, coming back.
[00:09:41.412 --> 00:09:46.014]  That's why you have to have a spirit of victory, a spirit of resistance, a spirit of honor.
[00:09:46.694 --> 00:09:48.134]  And it doesn't mean any of us are perfect.
[00:09:48.734 --> 00:09:51.615]  We're all flesh and blood, imperfect vessels.
[00:09:52.035 --> 00:09:54.076]  But we've got to ask God to lead God and direct us
[00:09:55.253 --> 00:09:59.656]  To go up against the globalists and we will prevail in the end, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:00.057 --> 00:10:06.281]  And it is the great animating contest of liberty versus tyranny that is what we were born to do.
[00:10:07.022 --> 00:10:13.306]  It is the animating contest of liberty that fulfills, that energizes, that expands horizons.
[00:10:14.968 --> 00:10:20.752]  The raw search for hedonistic enjoyments leads towards rack and ruin.
[00:10:22.182 --> 00:10:25.424]  And I'm not up here as some, you know, hypocrite lecturing people.
[00:10:25.524 --> 00:10:26.725]  Believe me, I know.
[00:10:26.745 --> 00:10:28.185]  I know.
[00:10:29.306 --> 00:10:30.667]  And there's balance in everything.
[00:10:31.147 --> 00:10:41.473]  But we are an incredibly unbalanced society, hurtling towards corruption, believing that more corruption, more decadence will fulfill us when it will not.
[00:10:42.033 --> 00:10:48.417]  It is purity and honesty and strength in the final equation that is fulfilling.
[00:10:50.455 --> 00:10:52.877]  Call the free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[00:10:53.077 --> 00:10:55.919]  Just throw the numbers out there on any issue you want to cover.
[00:10:55.959 --> 00:11:03.244]  I've got news I want to talk about on Obamacare, huge issues with the economy, huge issues on the NSA.
[00:11:03.644 --> 00:11:09.829]  I'm going to cover it all in this segment, and then I'm going to go to your phone calls.
[00:11:09.849 --> 00:11:10.009]  800-259-9231.
[00:11:10.309 --> 00:11:16.534]  But I want to direct radio listeners to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:11:19.639 --> 00:11:25.220]  To an article on the site, Army Halts Program, that labeled Christians radical extremists.
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:32.021]  Now, this is extremely, extremely, extremely good news.
[00:11:34.202 --> 00:11:45.784]  Because remember, just last year, when this was coming out in the Manuals Republic, the corporate controlled Decepticon press would say it didn't exist.
[00:11:46.894 --> 00:11:56.078]  Then, earlier this year, they said, okay, it does exist and we will arrest you and court-martial you if you proselytize even when you're not on duty.
[00:11:56.878 --> 00:11:57.799]  Well, that's your free speech.
[00:11:57.819 --> 00:12:02.460]  They don't care if you go get drunk or they don't care if you want to organize an occult ceremony, they do on the basis.
[00:12:02.761 --> 00:12:03.181]  No, no, no.
[00:12:03.241 --> 00:12:06.022]  It's Christianity solely they're going after.
[00:12:07.102 --> 00:12:10.704]  It's always the enemy of authoritarians because it makes a god above the state.
[00:12:11.601 --> 00:12:16.067]  And it doesn't fit in with the whole state-run system historically.
[00:12:16.328 --> 00:12:19.352]  That's why from Hitler to the Romans they attack Christians.
[00:12:20.353 --> 00:12:22.716]  Army halts program that labeled Christians
[00:12:24.364 --> 00:12:25.785]  Radical extremists.
[00:12:25.825 --> 00:12:29.327]  Look at how the Communists and the Soviets went after Christians.
[00:12:29.387 --> 00:12:30.368]  And this is how it all begins.
[00:12:30.408 --> 00:12:31.108]  Political correctness.
[00:12:31.468 --> 00:12:32.669]  First, don't be racist.
[00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:35.091]  Then, don't use words like this.
[00:12:35.131 --> 00:12:36.472]  Then, don't criticize the government.
[00:12:36.792 --> 00:12:39.373]  Then, don't talk about your religion on the street.
[00:12:40.474 --> 00:12:41.735]  Proselytizing is illegal.
[00:12:41.835 --> 00:12:43.556]  Then, don't do it in your own church.
[00:12:43.616 --> 00:12:45.037]  Then, you can't have your church.
[00:12:45.257 --> 00:12:47.378]  Then, we're going to arrest you if you don't renounce it.
[00:12:47.598 --> 00:12:49.860]  Then, we're going to arrest you even if you do renounce it.
[00:12:51.221 --> 00:12:52.722]  They have found families this year
[00:12:53.874 --> 00:13:02.600]  And a few decades ago as well, they found another wave, living in Siberia for more than 50 years, multi-generational, who can't even hardly talk anymore.
[00:13:03.941 --> 00:13:10.345]  Living hundreds of miles from humans, who were the children of Christians that fled Lenin and Stalin.
[00:13:10.365 --> 00:13:13.327]  In fact, you can just search.
[00:13:13.347 --> 00:13:14.948]  The Smithsonian reported on it a few months ago.
[00:13:15.268 --> 00:13:16.329]  Just incredible article.
[00:13:17.329 --> 00:13:21.352]  Because anthropologists and archaeologists have gone back to where they lived.
[00:13:22.455 --> 00:13:29.740]  And they survived off of a bag of seeds they ran away with, to be able to plant small crops, hidden.
[00:13:31.801 --> 00:13:33.022]  This is what it's like, folks.
[00:13:33.062 --> 00:13:37.124]  They killed, of the 80 plus million in China, most of them were Christians.
[00:13:37.164 --> 00:13:43.008]  They exterminated, with pleasure, under CIA directives, almost every Christian in China.
[00:13:44.898 --> 00:13:53.025]  Again, the globalists have been in control for a long time, and in compartmentalized operations, they could double-cross, put Mao in, and then give him his marching orders.
[00:13:53.645 --> 00:14:00.571]  Just like they did with the Khmer Rouge, and went after Christians and others in Cambodia, in the name of anti-communist.
[00:14:00.931 --> 00:14:07.237]  Just like they fund anti-Christian groups everywhere, Libya, Egypt, Syria.
[00:14:08.226 --> 00:14:16.649]  The globalists want to exterminate Christians, and they don't care if you're Protestant, they don't care if you are Catholic, they don't care if you are Orthodox.
[00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:19.570]  For some reason, if you're Orthodox, they really want you dead.
[00:14:21.231 --> 00:14:23.712]  And they will hunt you down, and they will kill you.
[00:14:24.172 --> 00:14:29.114]  And the average CIA clerk working in Langley, Virginia thinks they're fighting for Christianity and fighting for liberty.
[00:14:29.394 --> 00:14:33.696]  Meanwhile, the globalists get a Christian community alone, they will fund a group to murder them.
[00:14:34.696 --> 00:14:35.517]  It's not even the CIA.
[00:14:36.983 --> 00:14:43.368]  It is criminal groups within these agencies using the secrecy of the agencies to do whatever they want.
[00:14:43.729 --> 00:14:45.750]  And if they are not of the devil, they might as well be.
[00:14:45.771 --> 00:14:49.233]  I mean, they're certainly following that archetype to hunt down Christians.
[00:14:50.655 --> 00:14:56.520]  Now, if you're some Glitterbug, Tinkerbell, fake preacher saying, worship government, you can have a big mega church, they love you.
[00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:00.283]  You'll be InfraGard, you'll be Clergy Response Team, you'll have an FBI card in your wallet.
[00:15:03.979 --> 00:15:07.602]  But if you're a real Christian, they want to end your life.
[00:15:08.743 --> 00:15:11.906]  Conversion isn't enough to the New World Order religion.
[00:15:13.928 --> 00:15:15.349]  And they'll use anybody to kill you.
[00:15:15.469 --> 00:15:18.973]  Animists, Muslims, mercenaries, they don't care.
[00:15:19.153 --> 00:15:21.215]  Everywhere they kill the Christians.
[00:15:21.555 --> 00:15:23.056]  They go after the Christians.
[00:15:23.296 --> 00:15:24.177]  It's undoubtable.
[00:15:25.318 --> 00:15:26.459]  It's incontrovertible.
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:29.242]  It is a fact worldwide.
[00:15:31.459 --> 00:15:35.782]  That the spirit of this world does not like the idea of Jesus Christ.
[00:15:36.583 --> 00:15:41.286]  And you can ask yourself as an agnostic or an atheist, you know, why that is if you don't believe in God.
[00:15:41.727 --> 00:15:50.153]  My point is that regardless, the ideas in the Bible, in the New Testament particularly, scare tyrants to death.
[00:15:50.253 --> 00:15:58.019]  So, in America, our top story today is that the Secretary of the Army came out and released the memo.
[00:15:58.099 --> 00:16:00.501]  It's linked on Fox News and on Reuters.
[00:16:01.837 --> 00:16:08.121]  They officially came out and released, and the Secretary of the Army said this is outrageous and will no longer be done.
[00:16:09.542 --> 00:16:10.222]  So there you go.
[00:16:10.982 --> 00:16:13.004]  It is confirmed this is going on.
[00:16:13.404 --> 00:16:14.564]  Now, we already know what's going on.
[00:16:14.604 --> 00:16:15.505]  We have the training manuals.
[00:16:17.006 --> 00:16:19.307]  We've had... Well, they haven't hidden it.
[00:16:19.427 --> 00:16:22.049]  PSYOPS at Fort Hood gave us the information last year.
[00:16:27.301 --> 00:16:31.703]  You know why it seems to always be PSYOPs that keeps resisting inside the Pentagon?
[00:16:31.723 --> 00:16:37.566]  Because PSYOPs knows propaganda and knows manipulation and they recognize what's being used on them.
[00:16:40.247 --> 00:16:43.008]  Number one group awake, probably 90% PSYOPs.
[00:16:43.409 --> 00:16:44.389]  Special Warfare, 80%.
[00:16:45.029 --> 00:16:48.751]  Non-commissioned officers, 70% or more awake.
[00:16:49.051 --> 00:16:49.812]  Enlisted, around 50%.
[00:16:51.805 --> 00:16:53.126]  And it's exponentially growing.
[00:16:53.406 --> 00:17:02.829]  The best news I can give you here, ladies and gentlemen, is that the military that the globalists want to use against us is the most awake group in triplicate.
[00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:09.652]  Overwhelmingly, undoubtedly, just absolutely, it is a blessing that this is the case.
[00:17:09.672 --> 00:17:11.833]  And that's why the globalists knew this five years ago.
[00:17:12.213 --> 00:17:13.733]  They knew it was their only main threat.
[00:17:14.094 --> 00:17:15.014]  One of the dominant threats.
[00:17:15.854 --> 00:17:17.595]  The prime threat to their takeover.
[00:17:19.329 --> 00:17:25.248]  That's why they said returning veterans, Christian veterans, Christian soldiers are our enemy.
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:30.181]  Because they know you're not going to take part in evil, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:30.661 --> 00:17:37.044]  They know that when the rubber hits the road, you're going to resist the New World Order takeover of the Republic.
[00:17:37.484 --> 00:17:40.305]  And so you're their enemy, whether you like it or not, folks.
[00:17:40.345 --> 00:17:42.386]  They know what's written on your heart.
[00:17:42.666 --> 00:17:50.209]  They can see your soul, the devil, that the spirit of this world has come to attack you and wage war on you.
[00:17:51.693 --> 00:17:53.895]  And probably in the final equation, overcome you.
[00:17:54.416 --> 00:17:55.717]  But only for a season.
[00:17:56.178 --> 00:18:00.102]  Out of that will become the greatest revival the world has ever seen.
[00:18:00.122 --> 00:18:07.650]  And we're here to stand watchman and to warn what's coming in, the cashless society, the world government, the beast system.
[00:18:08.091 --> 00:18:10.073]  Undoubtedly, it's all being set up.
[00:18:10.373 --> 00:18:19.799]  The problem is these controlled globalist preachers come out on purpose and say, Christ is coming back next week, next month, next year, set these dates, to discredit things by design.
[00:18:20.039 --> 00:18:22.180]  These are globalist operatives, whether they know it or not.
[00:18:24.502 --> 00:18:34.348]  But you don't just go to the church and hide your head in the sand and say, oh good, you know, the mark of the beast is coming down the road, so I'll just go have fun and enjoy myself.
[00:18:34.588 --> 00:18:39.171]  You should be out there warning everyone about the megabanks, about the ten global regions.
[00:18:40.473 --> 00:18:42.596]  You know the Bible says ten regions, ten kings.
[00:18:42.816 --> 00:18:44.858]  They give their power to the world king that comes.
[00:18:45.118 --> 00:18:47.020]  The globalists set it up under ten kingdoms.
[00:18:47.281 --> 00:18:49.003]  The UN calls it ten kingdoms.
[00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:54.993]  The people at the UN believe Lucifer is Christ, and they're trying to bring him in.
[00:18:55.153 --> 00:18:56.334]  That's what atheists don't get.
[00:18:57.114 --> 00:18:58.355]  I've snuck into Bohemian Grove.
[00:18:58.435 --> 00:18:59.656]  I've covered Skull and Bones.
[00:19:00.137 --> 00:19:00.957]  I've researched it.
[00:19:01.037 --> 00:19:03.879]  I've met top globalists, and they say, yes, you're right.
[00:19:04.339 --> 00:19:05.821]  My family are Luciferians.
[00:19:06.221 --> 00:19:07.962]  We believe Lucifer is Christ, and he's coming.
[00:19:08.242 --> 00:19:09.823]  But I don't believe he's Christ.
[00:19:09.963 --> 00:19:10.884]  I believe he's the devil.
[00:19:11.344 --> 00:19:13.446]  And that's why I want to say we're not all bad, Alex.
[00:19:13.806 --> 00:19:15.207]  We are slaves of the system.
[00:19:15.267 --> 00:19:16.008]  What do we do?
[00:19:18.089 --> 00:19:41.414]  So whether God and the devil are real or not, this human archetype, and I just say that so there's no debate, whether God and the devil are real or not, you know wickedness and evil exist in the world, you know goodness exists, you know ugliness and beauty exist, you know freedom and slavery exist, and the God of this world, the people running things, are not atheists and agnostics.
[00:19:41.854 --> 00:19:42.674]  They worship
[00:19:43.803 --> 00:19:44.843]  The Spirit of Light.
[00:19:45.484 --> 00:19:48.085]  Tony Blair on record says, I worship the Angel of Light.
[00:19:48.345 --> 00:19:49.705]  Folks, that is a direct quote.
[00:19:49.905 --> 00:19:52.046]  The Angel of Light is Lucifer.
[00:19:52.086 --> 00:19:52.866]  That's what it means.
[00:19:53.326 --> 00:19:54.027]  Luminescence.
[00:19:54.267 --> 00:19:54.567]  Light.
[00:19:55.547 --> 00:19:57.308]  The false light of Lucifer.
[00:19:59.113 --> 00:20:04.276]  I didn't mean to get off into that, but the good news when we come back is that we forced this out in the open.
[00:20:04.976 --> 00:20:10.219]  The Pentagon had to admit it was going on and says they're stopping it, but we've got to keep pushing it when we come back.
[00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:14.562]  Are you prepared for disasters, job loss, and uncertain times?

[00:22:15.296 --> 00:22:22.520]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:25.862]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supplies.
[00:22:26.002 --> 00:22:27.784]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[00:22:28.024 --> 00:22:32.609]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.

[00:23:15.205 --> 00:23:16.406]  What are bitcoins?
[00:23:16.847 --> 00:23:22.932]  A bitcoin is the first decentralized currency that can be easily transferred from person to person over the internet.
[00:23:23.332 --> 00:23:24.774]  No bank needed.
[00:23:25.154 --> 00:23:30.439]  This means lower fees and accounts can never be frozen, limited or closed.

[00:24:25.853 --> 00:24:31.879]  Later I'll get more into this and the latest on the economy, the latest on health care and what a giant fraud it is.
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:42.629]  It is confirmed, it is a CIA, NSA run database to find out who doesn't have insurance to give you a fee, a fine, to take your bank account, to garnish your wages.
[00:24:43.871 --> 00:24:46.313]  They are just really arrogant.
[00:24:48.201 --> 00:24:50.724]  To keep your refund check.
[00:24:51.585 --> 00:24:53.847]  And that's why, from the leadership, it's bipartisan.
[00:24:54.527 --> 00:25:01.094]  Our country's run by foreign banks that are literally just squeezing, squeezing the country dry right now.
[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:04.561]  And folks have to come to grips with that.
[00:25:04.581 --> 00:25:08.362]  Now they're like, oh, we're going to delay the mandate to get the insurance.
[00:25:08.662 --> 00:25:13.124]  But they're not delaying the insurance companies being able to kick you off now and double your rates.
[00:25:13.564 --> 00:25:16.245]  See, that was the part that they wanted all along.
[00:25:16.465 --> 00:25:17.525]  They're not delaying it.
[00:25:18.186 --> 00:25:20.426]  They're kicking millions of people off their insurance.
[00:25:20.466 --> 00:25:23.107]  It's in the millions of millions now, just two weeks into this.
[00:25:23.708 --> 00:25:25.288]  They're doubling the rates on average.
[00:25:25.788 --> 00:25:26.669]  Affordable Care Act.
[00:25:26.689 --> 00:25:27.529]  See what a joke that is?
[00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:30.850]  And now the Democrats go, we accept this.
[00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:31.591]  This is good.
[00:25:31.651 --> 00:25:32.411]  We need to pay more.
[00:25:33.254 --> 00:25:34.115]  Because it's a cult.
[00:25:35.297 --> 00:25:37.659]  Yes, we accept parents can't pack their kids' lunches.
[00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:40.223]  Yes, we accept you can't have tag or dodgeball.
[00:25:42.247 --> 00:25:44.608]  You know, I went and saw Gravity last night.
[00:25:44.628 --> 00:25:51.091]  It's a very well done movie with Clooney and Sandra Bullock, but her child died from playing tag and running.
[00:25:51.772 --> 00:25:55.954]  And so they talk about how running needs to be banned, basically.
[00:25:56.894 --> 00:26:03.598]  Again, this is the prisoner level we're going into, folks, where we're shaved heads, walking around with football helmets on.
[00:26:04.238 --> 00:26:09.420]  In the nanny state while men with automatic weapons stand above us with robot drones, you know, aiming weapons at us.
[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:13.341]  I mean, this is... Don't be a cowboy at Halloween.
[00:26:13.381 --> 00:26:14.821]  It's racist towards cowboys.
[00:26:15.021 --> 00:26:15.261]  What?
[00:26:17.022 --> 00:26:19.243]  That's being announced by universities and high schools everywhere.
[00:26:19.283 --> 00:26:20.363]  And don't be an Indian.
[00:26:20.403 --> 00:26:21.063]  That's racist.
[00:26:21.103 --> 00:26:22.424]  See, you have no free speech.
[00:26:22.464 --> 00:26:23.164]  Everything's racist.
[00:26:23.384 --> 00:26:24.164]  You're a racist.
[00:26:24.244 --> 00:26:25.004]  Government's God.
[00:26:27.545 --> 00:26:29.366]  We're gonna go to break and come back to this short segment.
[00:26:29.426 --> 00:26:30.726]  I promise I'm going right to your calls.
[00:26:30.746 --> 00:26:32.847]  But let me just get into the big victory we've had.
[00:26:33.703 --> 00:26:35.503]  And it's a model of victory everywhere.
[00:26:36.143 --> 00:26:42.705]  We are at the gates trying to keep the gates up as the enemy has a big battering ram trying to fully knock it down.
[00:26:43.405 --> 00:26:45.205]  They've already infiltrated us from behind.
[00:26:45.225 --> 00:26:53.987]  They're shutting down our culture, shutting down our industry, attacking our morals, going over their entire program of control and manipulation.
[00:26:54.087 --> 00:26:56.927]  Do me a favor, give me the communist goals that came out in Congress.
[00:26:57.487 --> 00:27:01.028]  That KGB report from Cleon Skousen, I want to cover that later.
[00:27:02.731 --> 00:27:05.273]  Read this from the fifties and ask me if it hasn't come true.
[00:27:06.574 --> 00:27:18.523]  And the point is, is that still we're trying to hold up the main walls from the main assault and the enemies walking around inside going, there's nothing behind those walls but liberty and freedom.
[00:27:18.983 --> 00:27:20.704]  Don't listen to people, there's nothing bad.
[00:27:22.006 --> 00:27:37.943]  As a giant rock flies over from a catapult and crushes people, as we see the jobs lost, the families imploding, our health being lost, as we see the tyranny increasing, as we see the NSA spying, the secret arrests, the war on the press, the war on the family,
[00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:41.932]  It's all intensifying and they're saying there's nothing going on.
[00:27:42.092 --> 00:27:48.095]  Hey, look at this army manual saying Christianity will basically be banned and returning veterans of the number one terror threat.
[00:27:48.295 --> 00:27:49.376]  That doesn't exist.
[00:27:49.576 --> 00:27:50.316]  That's not real.
[00:27:50.856 --> 00:27:52.737]  And we force it out in the mainstream.
[00:27:53.178 --> 00:27:54.418]  Then they have to respond.
[00:27:54.879 --> 00:27:56.379]  Then there's a debate about it.
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:58.661]  And people go, wow, you're authoritarians.
[00:27:59.361 --> 00:28:03.484]  That sounds like Russia saying you can't be part of a Christian group.
[00:28:03.865 --> 00:28:20.298]  That sounds like Russia saying you can't be part of a mainline tea party with one of the lowest crime rates out there, totally legal lawful groups trying to make illegal by fiat totally mainline organizations, even radical organizations should be protected as long as they don't do anything illegal under the First Amendment.
[00:28:20.578 --> 00:28:20.958]  Wow!
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:25.322]  You're really, really, really, really dangerous!
[00:28:27.281 --> 00:28:34.264]  You see, we're now taking their attacks and trying to get us just to accept, okay, we can't pack lunches for our kids anymore.
[00:28:34.284 --> 00:28:39.046]  Okay, calling yourself father or mother is racist against gay people.
[00:28:39.747 --> 00:28:41.888]  See, now it's not tolerance towards gay people.
[00:28:41.948 --> 00:28:46.950]  Now, you being a father or mother, you being straight, that hurts them.
[00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:50.372]  See, it's not about tolerance, it's about adoption.
[00:28:51.311 --> 00:28:53.712]  And the globalists don't even care about gay stuff and all that.
[00:28:54.172 --> 00:28:58.874]  It's about attacking the dominant culture and getting you to accept anything they want.
[00:28:59.374 --> 00:29:04.056]  And that the state is the mommy and the daddy, which is officially taught in public schools nationwide.
[00:29:04.296 --> 00:29:06.176]  But here's the article, InfoWars.com.
[00:29:06.657 --> 00:29:10.238]  Army halts program that labeled Christians radical extremists.
[00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:23.586]  The Secretary of the Army has halted training programs that characterize conservatives as radical extremists in light of numerous media reports which highlighted how recruits were being taught that Christians were to be considered domestic hate groups.
[00:29:23.606 --> 00:29:24.086]  That's a quote.
[00:29:25.325 --> 00:29:26.767]  And then they train them for war with us.
[00:29:27.427 --> 00:29:48.369]  On several occasions over the past few months, media accounts have highlighted instances of Army instructors supplementing programs of instruction, Southern Provincial Law Center, and including information or material that is inaccurate, objectionable, and otherwise inconsistent with current Army policy, Army Secretary John McHugh wrote to the military leaders in a memorandum obtained by Fox News.
[00:29:49.875 --> 00:29:51.717]  We're gonna come back, folks, and go to your calls.
[00:29:51.737 --> 00:29:53.099]  I'm gonna get more into this in the next hour.
[00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:59.688]  But the point here is, we need to call now for investigations and arrest.
[00:29:59.908 --> 00:30:00.789]  We're on the march.
[00:30:01.290 --> 00:30:02.892]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.833 --> 00:30:06.497]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:11.328 --> 00:30:15.331]  When an emergency happens, you'll be left to fend for yourself and your family.

[00:32:20.727 --> 00:32:27.129]  Listen, there is some real scum in the alarm business cashing in by locking you into long, punishing contracts.

[00:33:11.899 --> 00:33:15.862]  I always fought the globalists because I have love, and that's my main engine.
[00:33:16.822 --> 00:33:18.083]  You can feel it, can't you?
[00:33:18.723 --> 00:33:19.204]  Boom!
[00:33:21.345 --> 00:33:22.066]  Alex Jones.

[00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:35.190]  You rat bastards!
[00:33:35.290 --> 00:33:38.931]  I'm a bleeding heart lover of humanity.
[00:33:39.011 --> 00:33:40.151]  Lover of goodness.
[00:33:40.291 --> 00:33:41.232]  Lover of courage.
[00:33:41.492 --> 00:33:42.372]  Lover of beauty.

[00:33:48.594 --> 00:33:50.754]  I mean, I do this because I care.
[00:33:50.994 --> 00:33:53.075]  Overnights on the Talk Superstation.
[00:33:57.403 --> 00:33:59.184]  Folks, we are back live.
[00:33:59.224 --> 00:34:00.205]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:34:00.245 --> 00:34:01.726]  I'm going directly to your phone calls.
[00:34:02.246 --> 00:34:03.647]  But this is a big deal.
[00:34:04.067 --> 00:34:06.128]  And this is the model.
[00:34:06.649 --> 00:34:07.289]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:34:07.349 --> 00:34:10.331]  Alex Jones back live here on this Friday edition.
[00:34:11.532 --> 00:34:13.973]  This is the model of defeating them.
[00:34:14.073 --> 00:34:15.674]  First they deny there's FEMA camps.
[00:34:17.353 --> 00:34:19.335]  Deny that they're training to take our guns.
[00:34:19.395 --> 00:34:26.440]  Then they deny that they're training to run checkpoints all over the country and round us up and put us in forced labor camps.
[00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:40.030]  But we go get all the Emergency Centers Establishment Act documents, the Civilian Inmate Labor Camp documents, all these other program documents, Freedom from War documents, 7277, State Department Miranda document.
[00:34:40.471 --> 00:34:41.972]  We get all those documents.
[00:34:42.012 --> 00:34:43.053]  We show them to people.
[00:34:44.238 --> 00:34:50.628]  And then the alternative media forces the story out there, and then it causes a debate in the military.
[00:34:51.449 --> 00:34:54.514]  Why do you think it's the military that's the most awake?
[00:34:54.534 --> 00:34:55.555]  I mean, there's a lot of reasons.
[00:34:56.710 --> 00:35:01.732]  But it's because they're actually in there, compartmentalized, being prepared for this.
[00:35:02.292 --> 00:35:14.857]  And now they're getting ready to go so operational for a staged civil war in America that they're down to, in many units, in many areas, to the privates, preparing them for war with the American people.
[00:35:17.625 --> 00:35:26.267]  I've been to these urban warfare drills many times, and they'll have the press there going, yes, we're training to be in Iraq, or we're training to be in Macedonia, or we're training for other countries.
[00:35:26.848 --> 00:35:31.469]  And then you'll go see the drill, and the soldiers will even be asking, I thought this was for overseas.
[00:35:32.069 --> 00:35:36.310]  Why are these people saying they're from San Francisco, we're fighting, and that they're in a militia?
[00:35:37.471 --> 00:35:40.591]  And I've actually seen, you know, the captain go, don't worry about that soldier.
[00:35:41.572 --> 00:35:45.573]  So, they'll have a cover story, but it's so flimsy
[00:35:47.668 --> 00:35:50.791]  It's designed to never even be challenged.
[00:35:52.352 --> 00:35:55.255]  And so we just ignore their lies, ignore their propaganda.
[00:35:55.535 --> 00:35:59.819]  We bring a flamethrower of truth to these people and burn them alive.
[00:35:59.839 --> 00:36:03.582]  I mean, the truth is like dragons fire to these worms.
[00:36:05.111 --> 00:36:18.859]  I mean, that's why they're so scared of us, is that we're honorable, we have the truth, and good men and women throughout the entire system worldwide care about their kids, and don't like criminals, and don't like scams, and deep down want prosperity.
[00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:31.947]  And so the military now heard us for decades, and many others, warning them about the takeover plan, and now it's here, and they think Obama's their closer, and they want to hurry up and try to do it.
[00:36:33.561 --> 00:36:36.422]  But now they're not doing it in a vacuum where no one's resisting them.
[00:36:37.042 --> 00:36:43.844]  Everyone's pointing out in media outlets as big or bigger than state-run media that it's the total takeover of society.
[00:36:44.064 --> 00:36:48.825]  When they say your kids don't belong to you, we're there challenging them, pointing out it's authoritarianism.
[00:36:49.425 --> 00:36:58.128]  When they say Christians are terrorists and need to be arrested and rounded up and if you are part of their group, we're going to arrest you, we're there challenging it.
[00:36:58.788 --> 00:37:01.749]  So if you challenge the over-the-top bad behavior,
[00:37:02.648 --> 00:37:05.489]  Then, it destroys those that are pushing it.
[00:37:06.049 --> 00:37:08.449]  This is all designed for us just to lay down and accept it.
[00:37:08.769 --> 00:37:09.490]  And it's not going to happen.
[00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:13.050]  Now, Paul Watson's written some good articles on this.
[00:37:13.570 --> 00:37:14.631]  Fox News has covered it.
[00:37:14.711 --> 00:37:15.351]  Others have covered it.
[00:37:15.711 --> 00:37:19.452]  But even Fox News and Infowars.com kind of whitewash it.
[00:37:20.472 --> 00:37:24.113]  Because the reality of this is so hardcore, it should be ten times worse.
[00:37:24.929 --> 00:37:28.690]  The headline is, Army halts program that labeled Christians radical extremists.
[00:37:28.770 --> 00:37:28.970]  No.
[00:37:29.610 --> 00:37:35.232]  Army halts program threatening to arrest Christian members of the military.
[00:37:36.493 --> 00:37:41.014]  That's what the training manuals that Fox News got said.
[00:37:44.045 --> 00:37:51.532]  Oh, it said evangelicals or radicals don't be part of them or you'll be court-martialed and don't be part of any Tea Party group or give money to any of these groups.
[00:37:51.572 --> 00:37:56.336]  Don't give money to an evangelical church or we will arrest you!
[00:37:56.936 --> 00:37:58.838]  Do I need to say how big that is again?
[00:37:58.858 --> 00:38:06.905]  I know I keep marveling here because if we just accept the social engineering and have a new normalcy bias to just accept in America
[00:38:07.185 --> 00:38:09.027]  They tell us what our kids can eat at school.
[00:38:09.307 --> 00:38:10.468]  We can't pack lunches.
[00:38:10.648 --> 00:38:12.630]  They're going to give them inoculations without asking.
[00:38:12.850 --> 00:38:15.693]  They're going to take 10-year-olds to have abortions without asking the parents.
[00:38:16.774 --> 00:38:19.396]  But you've got to have a thing to go to the planetarium or the zoo.
[00:38:20.646 --> 00:38:23.148]  Look how far down the rat hole we already are.
[00:38:23.348 --> 00:38:37.719]  But if we realize we're under attack, if we realize how out of control it is, and how bad-mouthing the Founding Fathers and gun owners and veterans is pure treason, and we point out that, wait a minute, we've got groups that admittedly worship Mao, seven of the fifteen or so czars.
[00:38:37.999 --> 00:38:40.341]  Wait, they say they want to put us in labor camps.
[00:38:40.621 --> 00:38:42.403]  They talk about martial law.
[00:38:42.903 --> 00:38:43.924]  Sheila Jackson Lee.
[00:38:44.344 --> 00:38:46.085]  Wait a minute, these aren't Americans.
[00:38:46.105 --> 00:38:47.206]  This is a takeover group.
[00:38:47.927 --> 00:38:48.788]  They want to arrest us?
[00:38:50.236 --> 00:38:52.038]  For being liberty lovers?
[00:38:52.679 --> 00:38:54.921]  You want to arrest Audie Murphy for fighting the Nazis?
[00:38:55.002 --> 00:38:55.262]  No.
[00:38:55.983 --> 00:38:57.945]  We're going to find out exactly who funds you.
[00:38:57.985 --> 00:38:58.786]  We know who funds you.
[00:38:58.946 --> 00:39:00.268]  The big foreign bank's on record.
[00:39:01.849 --> 00:39:05.554]  And we are going to keep exposing you and call for congressional investigations.
[00:39:05.634 --> 00:39:07.736]  And we're going to take the Congress over and the states over.
[00:39:07.756 --> 00:39:08.998]  And let me explain what's going to happen to you.
[00:39:10.074 --> 00:39:20.762]  Your leaders are going to end up going to prison for this, for a plan, I'm going to say this again, to arrest mainline Christians and put them in military brigs.
[00:39:21.763 --> 00:39:26.447]  I mean, again, words do not describe the mega magnitude of this.
[00:39:26.747 --> 00:39:39.129]  And this is what they're trying now because they're getting ready to go operational and start the civil war and have gun owners, veterans, and Christians listed as the enemy and have some type of red terror purge.
[00:39:39.409 --> 00:39:42.630]  They really believe in their ivory towers up there in D.C.
[00:39:42.930 --> 00:39:55.272]  They're going to get away with this and have it wipe out the military and police and a fight with us and then they roll in with the CHICOM and UN, world government, military in the final equation.
[00:39:57.028 --> 00:39:58.770]  That's how crazy these people are.
[00:39:59.631 --> 00:40:01.533]  And they're crazy enough to do it, historically.
[00:40:02.554 --> 00:40:11.665]  The globalists have done this in Russia, in China, in Cuba, in Africa all over the place, in Latin America, in Eastern Europe, in the Middle East.
[00:40:11.745 --> 00:40:15.209]  They will sit back while we have a decade-long civil war.
[00:40:16.144 --> 00:40:17.404]  Because they want to destroy America.
[00:40:17.985 --> 00:40:20.005]  Let me tell you, you think they won't get away with this?
[00:40:20.606 --> 00:40:23.026]  The plan is to destroy all of us.
[00:40:23.346 --> 00:40:25.467]  We are with the police and the military.
[00:40:25.707 --> 00:40:29.328]  And I hope they're listening, and I know those that disagree with me are listening.
[00:40:30.469 --> 00:40:32.209]  I know those that are awake are listening.
[00:40:32.850 --> 00:40:36.171]  Listen, you don't want to go down this road, Mr. Tough Guy.
[00:40:36.671 --> 00:40:39.572]  You are going to literally get run over.
[00:40:40.751 --> 00:40:43.713]  And in the process, a lot of good people are going to get smashed as well.
[00:40:43.813 --> 00:40:45.334]  We don't want this.
[00:40:46.014 --> 00:40:58.722]  The globalists and the collectivists and the communists that are financed by the foreign banks to do this to us, plan a major reorganization, collectivization, sovietization here in America.
[00:40:58.742 --> 00:41:00.463]  I said I'd go to your phone calls.
[00:41:00.524 --> 00:41:01.104]  I'm going to them.
[00:41:01.484 --> 00:41:03.545]  But we don't just stop.
[00:41:03.625 --> 00:41:08.889]  See, just a few days ago, they had the White House mouthpieces, Media Matters and others saying this wasn't real.
[00:41:11.155 --> 00:41:22.623]  They want to creep around behind the scenes with captured groups like the military and foster kids and public school children and college students, people under their control, under their big re-education camp.
[00:41:23.044 --> 00:41:32.370]  We can turn the military into a reverse re-education camp and turn it into a liberty camp of waking up and getting out of the camp and returning America.
[00:41:32.590 --> 00:41:34.332]  We can go into the cancer centers
[00:41:34.992 --> 00:41:39.375]  And reprogram with the truth and liberty and common sense that the troops are ready to take in.
[00:41:39.955 --> 00:41:41.876]  Like mother's milk instead of poison.
[00:41:42.337 --> 00:41:44.658]  They're ready to upload our information.
[00:41:44.798 --> 00:41:45.739]  They were built for it.
[00:41:45.899 --> 00:41:47.740]  They were made to be free men and women.
[00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:50.282]  They're ready for us to come and aid them.
[00:41:51.022 --> 00:41:56.483]  We will go into their attack programs, and we will seize it just like Operation Valkyrie.
[00:41:56.783 --> 00:41:58.984]  And that failed in 1944.
[00:41:59.044 --> 00:42:04.405]  But our program is non-aggressive, non-military.
[00:42:04.685 --> 00:42:09.947]  But we use the military as the growth area for this, and it's already been achieved.
[00:42:10.407 --> 00:42:14.848]  That was always my goal, but I didn't have the sophistication to understand all the different facets.
[00:42:14.888 --> 00:42:15.668]  I just knew it was key.
[00:42:16.408 --> 00:42:19.249]  To wake up the military and the police because they're the enforcement arm.
[00:42:19.449 --> 00:42:32.695]  But because they're the group prepared for war with us, while they watch the establishment media say they weren't being prepared for it, they know they're being lied to, and the mission is evil, and foreign, and corrupt, and traitorous, and evil.
[00:42:32.935 --> 00:42:34.396]  Now what is Operation Valkyrie?
[00:42:36.272 --> 00:42:47.116]  It is a martial law takeover system that Hitler set up, which then members of the General Staff were able to reverse Jack and try to turn against Hitler.
[00:42:47.216 --> 00:42:47.716]  It failed.
[00:42:48.777 --> 00:42:57.600]  But the point is, what I'm telling you is, we can use the entire system they've already set up not to go take out the illegitimate government,
[00:42:58.399 --> 00:43:12.225]  We will use the fact that they've set up a Valkyrie program against us, but that that traitorous Valkyrie program against the Republic is the proof and the confession of the treason by the globalists.
[00:43:12.245 --> 00:43:13.046]  Do you understand this?
[00:43:13.706 --> 00:43:20.668]  That they would come out and openly say all evangelicals are terrorists and the enemy, and you'll be arrested if you're one.
[00:43:20.909 --> 00:43:29.752]  They went to total Soviet-level evil in front of the entire military, 100% convicted that they are enemy infiltrators.
[00:43:31.372 --> 00:43:33.153]  Do you understand that, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:43:34.724 --> 00:43:51.076]  And again, Napolitano, four years ago, Thursday, April 16, 2009, stood by her report in the Associated Press, in the Washington Times, and said, Christians and returning vets are the terror enemy, not Al Qaeda.
[00:43:51.917 --> 00:43:54.179]  The troops, though, are busy.
[00:43:54.239 --> 00:43:55.460]  They didn't go look this up.
[00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:56.741]  They just heard me saying it.
[00:43:57.662 --> 00:43:59.843]  And thought, they'll never say Christians are our enemy.
[00:44:00.183 --> 00:44:05.484]  Now they're being taught that, and now they were already told by us, the enemy's gonna come in and do this, get ready.
[00:44:05.744 --> 00:44:10.366]  And then here comes the enemy around the corner, like a stampede of traitorous goblins.
[00:44:11.086 --> 00:44:20.069]  And we are ready for them, not flat-footed, geared up, surging forward worldwide, the transmission's out, the emergency beacon is blasting.
[00:44:20.329 --> 00:44:22.249]  Some people say my show's a broken record sometimes.
[00:44:22.529 --> 00:44:24.210]  You bet I'm a broken record to the military.
[00:44:24.790 --> 00:44:26.651]  You bet I'm hearing emergency transmission.
[00:44:26.991 --> 00:44:30.272]  Blasting out the carrier wave to everybody going, Republic!
[00:44:30.292 --> 00:44:31.352]  Republic under attack!
[00:44:31.812 --> 00:44:32.352]  SOS!
[00:44:32.392 --> 00:44:32.812]  Mayday!
[00:44:32.872 --> 00:44:33.273]  Mayday!
[00:44:33.333 --> 00:44:33.753]  Mayday!
[00:44:33.833 --> 00:44:34.213]  Mayday!
[00:44:34.273 --> 00:44:34.673]  Mayday!
[00:44:34.953 --> 00:44:36.474]  Cancer viruses in the vaccines!
[00:44:37.074 --> 00:44:38.794]  Soft kill chemical weapons in the water!
[00:44:38.874 --> 00:44:39.294]  Mayday!
[00:44:39.354 --> 00:44:39.714]  Mayday!
[00:44:39.935 --> 00:44:41.155]  Here's where they say they're doing it!
[00:44:41.355 --> 00:44:42.355]  Here's who the enemy is!
[00:44:42.575 --> 00:44:43.336]  Here's their goal!
[00:44:43.556 --> 00:44:45.456]  Here's who created them 160 years ago!
[00:44:45.476 --> 00:44:47.117]  A Galton!
[00:44:47.197 --> 00:44:47.617]  Eugenics!
[00:44:48.457 --> 00:44:51.259]  And I'm just giving you the data points so you can go see it for yourself.
[00:44:51.539 --> 00:44:52.059]  Emergency!
[00:44:52.079 --> 00:44:52.559]  Emergency!
[00:44:52.599 --> 00:44:53.280]  Here's who hit us!
[00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:54.400]  Here's who they are!
[00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:55.361]  They've taken over!
[00:44:55.421 --> 00:44:56.121]  Red alert!
[00:44:56.361 --> 00:44:57.302]  They're with Al-Qaeda!
[00:44:57.362 --> 00:44:57.882]  Watch out!
[00:44:57.922 --> 00:44:58.422]  Watch out!
[00:44:58.482 --> 00:44:58.983]  Watch out!
[00:44:59.963 --> 00:45:02.064]  And people hear this, they go, our government's running Al-Qaeda?
[00:45:02.084 --> 00:45:02.464]  Yeah, right!
[00:45:02.665 --> 00:45:04.125]  Now they publicly run them, see?
[00:45:04.806 --> 00:45:06.026]  And they go, Al-Qaeda isn't a threat!
[00:45:06.066 --> 00:45:07.787]  Your granddaddy, who's a Christian, is a threat!
[00:45:08.167 --> 00:45:10.389]  That veteran, that Vietnam veteran, he's a threat!
[00:45:10.649 --> 00:45:13.410]  Well, you bet they're the threat to a foreign takeover!
[00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:16.032]  Of course they're a threat to foreign enemies!
[00:45:16.952 --> 00:45:22.416]  They swore an oath to defend the Republic against all enemies, foreign and domestic, and they need to stand by it.
[00:45:22.556 --> 00:45:24.938]  But the American people need to stand by it as well.
[00:45:25.659 --> 00:45:26.720]  Oh, I said I'd go to your calls.
[00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:30.182]  We need congressional investigations on this.
[00:45:30.222 --> 00:45:31.323]  They are caught red-handed.
[00:45:31.603 --> 00:45:42.692]  We need the ADL, the Southern Poverty Law Center, that are running all this, hauled up before Congress, who are in our police departments and everything else, teaching the police this crap.
[00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:49.374]  So that anybody that stands in the way of the country being usurped can be arrested!
[00:45:49.655 --> 00:45:51.376]  These are authoritarians!
[00:45:51.796 --> 00:45:57.962]  If you want, I'm telling you, the blueprint is a high-tech version of the 1917 takeover in Russia, folks.
[00:45:57.982 --> 00:45:58.882]  You better go study that.
[00:45:59.183 --> 00:46:00.644]  I'm telling you, that's their plan.
[00:46:01.044 --> 00:46:02.826]  That's what they admit they're following.
[00:46:03.646 --> 00:46:05.468]  We are all in grave danger, okay?
[00:46:06.229 --> 00:46:07.129]  That's all I have to say.
[00:46:07.390 --> 00:46:12.334]  And if you think cowering to these people is going to protect you, you're insane.
[00:46:14.059 --> 00:46:15.000]  You are insane.
[00:46:16.061 --> 00:46:18.644]  And by the way, the globalists pushing this are destroying themselves as well.
[00:46:19.004 --> 00:46:21.707]  Only a moron would bring something in this evil.
[00:46:22.027 --> 00:46:23.789]  Look at the folks that brought the Soviet thing in.
[00:46:24.009 --> 00:46:26.732]  They had purge after purge of each other for 50 years.
[00:46:27.573 --> 00:46:30.736]  What a nightmare situation you're creating.
[00:46:30.876 --> 00:46:35.761]  This is the most self-destructive action by the elite I could even imagine.
[00:46:37.861 --> 00:46:38.121]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[00:46:38.141 --> 00:46:38.501]  Yeah, I'm on a roof.
[00:46:38.521 --> 00:46:39.222]  Gotta stop the hammering here.
[00:46:39.242 --> 00:46:39.882]  Two little things if I could.
[00:46:39.902 --> 00:46:41.883]  If you could get Noam Chomsky on the show.
[00:46:59.116 --> 00:47:00.537]  I've tried to get Noam Chomsky on.
[00:47:00.557 --> 00:47:06.519]  I got him on like 12, 14 years ago, I forget, and he was against the Second Amendment and I couldn't help blowing up at him.
[00:47:06.599 --> 00:47:10.081]  I politically agree with him on a lot of his analysis, just not on his solutions.
[00:47:10.541 --> 00:47:20.465]  He is a very smart person, but he said that, you know, using a British model, two different cultures, that more guns means more crime, when statistically in our culture it means lower crime.
[00:47:20.686 --> 00:47:23.787]  That's incontrovertible now, so I blew up at Chomsky.
[00:47:25.390 --> 00:47:26.353]  Well, I can see that.
[00:47:26.493 --> 00:47:33.592]  But, Milos, the reason why is because he's kind of an icon for the left, and it could bring a lot of the left into your show.
[00:47:34.059 --> 00:47:44.185]  I've already sent an email probably five years ago apologizing to Chomsky saying I want to do a more professional interview on things we agree with and it'd be a good platform for him to come on.
[00:47:44.245 --> 00:47:46.426]  So I've already, I could have done the interview better.
[00:47:46.446 --> 00:47:50.788]  I apologize for blowing up at him and calling him stupid.
[00:47:52.549 --> 00:47:55.571]  But I knew that he was smart enough to know that's two different cultural models.
[00:47:56.652 --> 00:47:58.473]  And so cultures are different and vary.
[00:47:59.053 --> 00:48:00.374]  And so it's a side issue.
[00:48:00.414 --> 00:48:02.115]  Just the Second Amendment's a real hot button for me.
[00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:12.843]  I'd be good, I think, if you dwelt upon the Irish experience a little more, like, you know, the Troubles in the 80s and the IRA and all.
[00:48:12.983 --> 00:48:24.847]  I mean, even though you said higher echelons of the IRA were in cahoots with the British Secret Service, as far as rebellion, I mean, it's an incredible model of heroism.
[00:48:24.987 --> 00:48:28.008]  Oh, no, no, I'm not saying that all the Irish rebels were bad people.
[00:48:28.028 --> 00:48:30.469]  They were incredible people and I admire what they did and their courage.
[00:48:31.549 --> 00:48:33.030]  The leadership didn't even really have a choice.
[00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:38.612]  You know, MI5 and the Commandos and MI6 were killing them if they didn't become double agents.
[00:48:39.012 --> 00:48:45.294]  So that's what I'm saying, is that that's the problem with any covert operation, is it can be threatened or taken over.
[00:48:45.654 --> 00:48:50.595]  Even if your leader's, you know, messianic and doesn't mind being killed, they can still try to decapitate it.
[00:48:50.815 --> 00:48:54.916]  That's why it has to be leaderless and just an idea that's unstoppable.
[00:48:55.256 --> 00:48:56.597]  Because ideas are bulletproof.
[00:48:57.739 --> 00:49:02.466]  A friend of mine who I think was, you know, may have been involved in that stuff, but those guys never really talk about it.
[00:49:03.167 --> 00:49:09.677]  He said that a mere 200 IRA snipers closed down the operations of a 35,000 man British Army.
[00:49:11.747 --> 00:49:31.941]  Oh yeah, I mean, if folks think the IRA that could barely get weapons, I mean, one of the most disarmed places in the world for hundreds of years, if they thought the IRA gave the British regulars trouble, can you imagine what a civil war is going to look like with the patriots against the snot-nosed folks that'll engage in treasonous activities?
[00:49:33.322 --> 00:49:36.384]  Yeah, and so, real quick, make us your lead-in song.
[00:49:38.174 --> 00:49:43.377]  The wolf tones, the men behind the wire, or men behind the wire, you know, after next break.
[00:49:43.958 --> 00:49:44.318]  Great.
[00:49:44.598 --> 00:49:45.679]  Great inspirational song.
[00:49:46.624 --> 00:49:49.865]  You know, about the IRA going to get their men out of the British jail.
[00:49:49.925 --> 00:49:50.965]  Yes, sir, we'll look it up.
[00:49:51.045 --> 00:49:51.705]  God bless you.
[00:49:52.305 --> 00:49:53.145]  No, no, I agree.
[00:49:53.385 --> 00:49:55.406]  The model of total resistance is the way to go.
[00:49:55.426 --> 00:50:00.526]  They start trying to arrest us and round us up, which they're openly saying, we're going to put Christians in jail.
[00:50:01.207 --> 00:50:04.207]  We're not going to just audit and harass the Tea Party.
[00:50:04.247 --> 00:50:05.387]  We're going to put you in jail.
[00:50:05.787 --> 00:50:08.808]  I mean, these are flaming criminals.
[00:50:08.928 --> 00:50:11.588]  I mean, they are outrageously evil.
[00:50:12.649 --> 00:50:14.329]  People ask why I get upset and start yelling.
[00:50:15.765 --> 00:50:27.189]  When the government starts saying we're going to arrest mainline Christians, we're going to arrest soldiers that are part of Christian organizations, or part of the Tea Party, I mean, Obama should be impeached and arrested right now.
[00:50:27.749 --> 00:50:45.315]  I mean, if our country had any sense, there would be an emergency in Congress, they would be dragging him in, he would at least resign, we would find out who's doing this, people would be indicted, because you have free speech, but you don't have speech to... I mean, if I went and organized and tried to take over,
[00:50:46.084 --> 00:50:50.987]  And try to say get with my neighbors to go tell my other neighbors we'll beat you up or put you in jail if you're a Christian.
[00:50:51.388 --> 00:50:52.428]  That would be racketeering.
[00:50:52.929 --> 00:50:54.129]  But the government does it.
[00:50:54.570 --> 00:51:02.095]  I mean it is tyranny with a gigantic flaming capital satanic T the size of the earth.

[00:53:09.654 --> 00:53:15.262]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[00:53:15.403 --> 00:53:22.653]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[00:53:22.793 --> 00:53:25.958]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[00:53:26.098 --> 00:53:27.879]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[00:53:28.139 --> 00:53:32.701]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[00:53:32.781 --> 00:53:35.542]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[00:53:35.702 --> 00:53:41.484]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[00:53:41.644 --> 00:53:45.126]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[00:53:45.326 --> 00:53:50.388]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine.
[00:53:50.568 --> 00:53:53.229]  Exclusively available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:53:53.749 --> 00:53:59.613]  Nascent Iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.
[00:53:59.733 --> 00:54:01.734]  Survival Shield Nascent Iodine.

[00:54:19.645 --> 00:54:21.867]  My friends, you should be upset.
[00:54:22.288 --> 00:54:23.469]  You should be concerned.
[00:54:23.489 --> 00:54:25.792]  You should be calling Congress and never stop.
[00:54:26.092 --> 00:54:33.159]  Because if they can come out and say, we're going to arrest members of the military who are evangelicals, one of the biggest Christian groups in the country.
[00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:36.683]  We're going to arrest you if you give money to the Tea Party.
[00:54:37.103 --> 00:54:38.645]  I mean, that is racketeering.
[00:54:38.685 --> 00:54:39.886]  That is organized crime.
[00:54:40.547 --> 00:54:42.049]  Violating somebody's civil rights.
[00:54:44.042 --> 00:54:48.263]  That's even beyond saying, you know, black folks aren't allowed to vote, or white folks, or whatever.
[00:54:49.223 --> 00:54:51.544]  I mean, that's saying you can't even be part of your religion.
[00:54:53.244 --> 00:54:54.785]  That is just so criminal!
[00:54:55.125 --> 00:54:56.605]  And again, they're not liberals.
[00:54:56.645 --> 00:54:58.845]  These are authoritarian crooks.
[00:55:00.086 --> 00:55:01.586]  And they love any captured audience.
[00:55:01.646 --> 00:55:04.907]  School kids, military, any group they can control.
[00:55:06.567 --> 00:55:09.228]  Any group they can mess with and do social engineering on.
[00:55:10.239 --> 00:55:10.719]  It's amazing.
[00:55:10.739 --> 00:55:12.460]  I'm going to go right back to your phone calls.
[00:55:13.541 --> 00:55:15.842]  Let's go ahead and talk to Omar.
[00:55:16.503 --> 00:55:17.103]  You're on the air.
[00:55:17.143 --> 00:55:17.503]  Go ahead.
[00:55:17.523 --> 00:55:19.705]  How you doing, Alex?
[00:55:19.825 --> 00:55:24.728]  I just want to run through a few quick points and then you can have your response.
[00:55:24.868 --> 00:55:39.797]  First of all, I would like to say that how have we gone to a country with a hyper communist leader whose campaign slogan is a new dawn and who repeatedly
[00:55:41.005 --> 00:55:45.308]  Discusses socialist ideals like it's no type of big deal.
[00:56:11.445 --> 00:56:11.945]  Definitely.
[00:56:12.646 --> 00:56:19.691]  My second point is the sovereignty of our nation is being destroyed through the North American Union for many purposes.
[00:56:20.352 --> 00:56:30.580]  One main purpose that I would like to bring upon to the audience is that in Canada right now they are eliminating money transfer, physical money.
[00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:37.945]  They are starting to use biometric systems to use for financial transactions.
[00:56:38.606 --> 00:56:40.247]  So my thing is I feel like
[00:56:41.276 --> 00:56:43.370]  Once they set the president, that's when...
[00:56:44.292 --> 00:56:47.814]  Obama and his cronies, they're going to try to do the same thing.
[00:56:47.834 --> 00:56:50.615]  They're already trying to implement biometrics in the schools.
[00:56:51.015 --> 00:56:51.855]  Well, they're already doing it.
[00:56:51.895 --> 00:56:53.776]  Listen, sir, I totally agree with your points.
[00:56:54.416 --> 00:56:56.737]  Everything is on a timetable to implode the world economy.
[00:56:56.757 --> 00:57:00.979]  They admit this at Davos every year and bring in the global SDR as the solution.
[00:57:01.279 --> 00:57:02.640]  They're in the news now doing it.
[00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:06.001]  They're going to maneuver us into a global currency.
[00:57:06.241 --> 00:57:10.423]  You'll still have a regional currency, but it's going to be denominated in SDRs.
[00:57:10.723 --> 00:57:11.644]  In fact, the dollar
[00:57:12.777 --> 00:57:13.157]  I agree.
[00:57:13.177 --> 00:57:14.198]  I have two more points.
[00:57:14.278 --> 00:57:16.198]  One is about the Boston Marathon.
[00:57:41.434 --> 00:58:02.408]  These people in the media are so sloppy that they actually took the picture from the principal of Sandy Hook, who they said got killed, who they said Adam Lanza shot, and then when the Boston Marathon happened, they put her picture up, changed her name a little bit, and said that she was a victim of the Boston Marathon.
[00:58:03.373 --> 00:58:06.095]  Well, I know this, and God bless you, I appreciate your call.
[00:58:06.856 --> 00:58:11.039]  Obviously the White House is watching, they're listening, they have their front groups write about us daily.
[00:58:11.740 --> 00:58:15.503]  All I can tell you is Sandy Hook is very mysterious, there is a cover-up.
[00:58:15.783 --> 00:58:18.125]  The state admits there's a cover-up of what drugs he was on.
[00:58:18.145 --> 00:58:19.646]  It was clearly another shooter.
[00:58:20.147 --> 00:58:21.268]  The whole story's a fraud.
[00:58:21.288 --> 00:58:24.710]  The Boston bombing, they had multiple drills going on, we confirmed that.
[00:58:25.071 --> 00:58:26.172]  They ordered a stand-down.
[00:58:27.555 --> 00:58:36.721]  Even those taking part in the drills thought that there was a bombing during the drill while the National Archives, a key National Archive area, burned down at the same time.
[00:58:37.001 --> 00:58:38.362]  So they always do other weird stuff.
[00:58:38.723 --> 00:58:39.883]  Definitely a black-off.
[00:58:40.604 --> 00:58:42.785]  Definitely double agents of the CIA.
[00:58:43.166 --> 00:58:44.526]  The Czarnev brothers, they set up.
[00:58:44.586 --> 00:58:45.547]  That came out, by the way.
[00:58:45.947 --> 00:58:47.649]  So, definitely a stage deal.
[00:58:47.669 --> 00:58:48.129]  Stay with us.
[00:58:53.152 --> 00:58:57.115]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.

[00:59:48.962 --> 00:59:50.984]  And sodium hexafluorosilicate.

[01:00:05.858 --> 01:00:08.621]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:15.182 --> 01:00:19.364]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:20.024 --> 01:00:20.824]  You want answers?
[01:00:21.604 --> 01:00:22.505]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:23.145 --> 01:00:26.746]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:27.347 --> 01:00:31.428]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:39.246 --> 01:00:41.867]  I've got a ton of news I'm going to cover after we continue taking your calls.
[01:00:41.927 --> 01:00:43.347]  Mark Dice is going to be popping in.
[01:00:43.367 --> 01:00:48.168]  He had that video last week where liberals were calling for Nazi Germany for Obama.
[01:00:48.188 --> 01:00:49.309]  He actually said that.
[01:00:50.509 --> 01:00:53.090]  I want to show you a video that's up on Infowars.com.
[01:00:53.130 --> 01:00:55.650]  Fort Hood soldiers told Christians are radical terrorists.
[01:00:56.350 --> 01:00:59.371]  Leanne McAdoo did a report on that last night on the Nightly News.
[01:01:00.091 --> 01:01:01.892]  And then I see a comment down here
[01:01:03.683 --> 01:01:30.198]  by heroes comments saying Alex Jones why don't you talk about the new network shows showing all these new cop shows coming out where they're all in military gear knocking on people's doors as if they are trying to give us the perception this is all normal the network TV is doing a number on us with their new programming Obama propaganda everyone says yes please illegally search my car when I know I have an old roach in the ashtray these people are idiots
[01:01:31.590 --> 01:01:40.214]  All I've ever talked about is for 20 years at least, any gun owner, anybody who's against tyranny is arrested on these shows.
[01:01:40.254 --> 01:01:42.695]  Anybody who's a homeschooler is a criminal.
[01:01:43.255 --> 01:01:45.096]  Any parents that are Christian are criminals.
[01:01:46.857 --> 01:01:54.320]  We do reports every few months on the Nightly News where the cartoons, the dramas, the cop shows, every movie I go see that's a drama or cop show,
[01:01:55.140 --> 01:02:01.464]  Cop movie is illegal checkpoints and, you know, random stuff going on to condition you that it's normal.
[01:02:01.524 --> 01:02:01.884]  Yes.
[01:02:02.485 --> 01:02:03.305]  Yes, I know.
[01:02:03.405 --> 01:02:07.548]  It's part of the total acclimation of the police and military as well.
[01:02:08.868 --> 01:02:13.371]  And now they're segwaying into Christians are the enemy and gun owners are the enemy.
[01:02:13.771 --> 01:02:15.212]  Yes, yes, we're in trouble.
[01:02:16.693 --> 01:02:21.216]  And so I do talk about it, but people think because I don't talk about something in one video,
[01:02:24.946 --> 01:02:27.729]  That doesn't mean then in every other video I haven't covered it.
[01:02:28.349 --> 01:02:41.321]  There's like this thing where if a video is about one thing, then there must not be any other videos in the known universe that I've done that covered it.
[01:02:41.381 --> 01:02:42.862]  It's just a really weird criticism.
[01:02:43.483 --> 01:02:44.564]  I see a lot out there.
[01:02:44.584 --> 01:02:46.145]  I mean, this wasn't even so much a criticism.
[01:02:46.165 --> 01:02:48.808]  It just becomes a pet peeve that, why didn't you cover this?
[01:02:48.848 --> 01:02:49.448]  Why didn't you cover that?
[01:02:49.748 --> 01:02:50.849]  I try to cover as much as I can.
[01:02:52.415 --> 01:02:53.375]  We're going to go back to your calls.
[01:02:53.435 --> 01:02:54.476]  Come back to them in the next segment.
[01:02:54.496 --> 01:02:56.256]  I've got to get to news before Mark Dice joins us.
[01:02:56.496 --> 01:02:57.597]  Then we'll go back into your calls.
[01:02:57.777 --> 01:02:59.197]  There's a lot of key news coming up.
[01:03:00.418 --> 01:03:03.379]  Right now, let's go to Catherine in Canada.
[01:03:03.439 --> 01:03:04.159]  You're on the air.
[01:03:04.179 --> 01:03:04.519]  Go ahead.
[01:03:04.539 --> 01:03:06.560]  Hi, Alex.
[01:03:07.782 --> 01:03:13.506]  I just have a theory that I want to bounce off you and see what you think.
[01:03:13.966 --> 01:03:18.909]  It's about Obamacare and the healthcare.gov website and all the security issues around it.
[01:03:19.449 --> 01:03:28.335]  I honestly think they're going to use the security issues with the healthcare website and scrap it and then implement the medical RFID chips stating to the American people
[01:03:28.895 --> 01:03:33.376]  That this is the new secure way to get healthcare, and that's how they're going to get people to get the chip.
[01:03:33.756 --> 01:03:40.858]  And I think that's why they're persecuting Christians, because we all know that's technically the mark of the beast, and I think that's why they're persecuting Christians now.
[01:03:41.058 --> 01:03:41.578]  Well, that's right.
[01:03:41.718 --> 01:03:42.218]  No, no, no.
[01:03:42.519 --> 01:03:43.039]  That's right.
[01:03:43.559 --> 01:03:48.940]  And they actually admit, the government releases the social security numbers, they foster the fraud.
[01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:51.621]  They foster the fraud.
[01:03:52.831 --> 01:03:59.033]  So that then when there's identity theft crises, they can bring in the biometrics, bring in the chips, bring in the control.
[01:03:59.353 --> 01:04:04.495]  The head of Google said two weeks ago, we are going to put chips in your brain, not just in your body.
[01:04:04.815 --> 01:04:06.736]  And if it's trendy, I mean, people will do it.
[01:04:08.351 --> 01:04:13.094]  I totally believe that's how, because I've seen a commercial for this medical chip, but that's how they want to keep the information.
[01:04:13.114 --> 01:04:25.240]  And I think that's what they're doing, is they're going to make the website so corrupt to make people beg for a new secure system, and that's how they're going to tell people this is the best way to do it, the secure way, get this medical chip and everybody, their health care will be fine.
[01:04:25.741 --> 01:04:27.582]  And I just wonder if you agree or disagree on that.
[01:04:30.323 --> 01:04:31.964]  Ma'am, you're absolutely on target.
[01:04:32.765 --> 01:04:35.126]  I totally and completely agree with you.
[01:04:37.368 --> 01:04:40.670]  And the average church will not warn anybody because their government run.
[01:04:41.190 --> 01:04:44.052]  Their 501c3 and their clergy response team.
[01:04:44.452 --> 01:04:45.233]  Thank you so much.

[01:07:16.998 --> 01:07:21.742]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:07:22.142 --> 01:07:24.003]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[01:07:26.195 --> 01:07:28.917]  Well, they make blue diamond gusset jeans.

[01:08:07.507 --> 01:08:08.388]  Others don't.
[01:08:15.305 --> 01:08:19.509]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:08:20.150 --> 01:08:20.951]  You want answers?
[01:08:21.731 --> 01:08:22.572]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:23.273 --> 01:08:26.896]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:27.477 --> 01:08:31.541]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:44.209 --> 01:09:00.798]  There is still a lot of good in the world, but there are criminal interests engaged in scientifically developed high-tech forms of cultural warfare to break down our society and turn humanity into human resources.
[01:09:02.519 --> 01:09:05.080]  The social engineers are our enemy.
[01:09:05.460 --> 01:09:07.101]  They're not trying to build a better world.
[01:09:08.022 --> 01:09:10.223]  That's always creating disasters as well.
[01:09:12.281 --> 01:09:21.145]  They are consciously building an anti-human, transhumanist eugenicist world in their attempt to play God.
[01:09:21.585 --> 01:09:24.046]  I want to cover a few news stories and go right back to your phone calls.
[01:09:24.827 --> 01:09:26.748]  Here is a story out of CNS News.
[01:09:27.228 --> 01:09:36.412]  Census Bureau means-tested government benefit recipients outnumber full-time year-round workers.
[01:09:40.473 --> 01:09:43.936]  108 million people are on the welfare dole one way or another.
[01:09:43.956 --> 01:09:46.379]  That's more than all full-time workers.
[01:09:46.859 --> 01:09:48.221]  And now officially...
[01:09:51.052 --> 01:10:01.776]  The federal government is encouraging companies under Obamacare to lay people off to part-time, and then tell them to go get welfare assistance as a supplement.
[01:10:02.457 --> 01:10:11.421]  And that's what they've done with the illegal aliens, is they bring them in, they work at wages you can't live on, and then they're given government supplement, even though they're here illegally, those agencies give it to them.
[01:10:12.881 --> 01:10:14.562]  And that's been admitted for a long time.
[01:10:14.642 --> 01:10:17.383]  This is to get everybody dependent, clouded, and piven.
[01:10:18.884 --> 01:10:19.484]  And they've done it.
[01:10:21.203 --> 01:10:21.884]  We're now there.
[01:10:22.404 --> 01:10:23.665]  That's why they're making their move.
[01:10:24.346 --> 01:10:26.768]  And they're going to make those of us that produce their slaves.
[01:10:27.708 --> 01:10:31.571]  And the people living on welfare don't know they'd have a better life in a true free market.
[01:10:32.132 --> 01:10:33.633]  They don't know the standard of living's dropped.
[01:10:33.953 --> 01:10:40.579]  They don't know they're being put on welfare to get control of them so they can be medical guinea pigs and be forced to take vaccines and the rest of it.
[01:10:41.159 --> 01:10:42.661]  They don't know what eugenics is.
[01:10:42.721 --> 01:10:45.363]  They have no idea they're going into slavery.
[01:10:48.100 --> 01:10:50.440]  We're now crossing the Rubicon into the new dawn.
[01:10:50.621 --> 01:10:53.501]  Forward, as the communists say, under Obama's slogans.
[01:10:56.022 --> 01:10:56.962]  So, there you go.
[01:10:57.042 --> 01:11:00.963]  Most Americans accumulating debt faster than they're saving for retirement.
[01:11:01.383 --> 01:11:09.724]  We're going into debt bondage, where the taxes and the regulations have been set, where the mass of the people will be bankrupted.
[01:11:09.904 --> 01:11:14.025]  And then they'll turn the heat up again and bankrupt the nouveau riche, and then the wealthy.
[01:11:14.685 --> 01:11:17.206]  Only the ultra-rich offshore will be left with money.
[01:11:18.831 --> 01:11:22.274]  And they'll be no ladder up for the poor, the permanent poor.
[01:11:22.314 --> 01:11:25.016]  And then they're going to cut the welfare off, which is already beginning.
[01:11:25.056 --> 01:11:27.438]  Notice right that they crossed the 50% mark.
[01:11:28.539 --> 01:11:30.201]  Now they're up to like 50 plus percent.
[01:11:31.002 --> 01:11:32.082]  Just a year ago it was 47%.
[01:11:32.122 --> 01:11:32.703]  Now it's 49, about to be 51, 52.
[01:11:36.570 --> 01:11:37.831]  You count all the illegals, it's like 60%.
[01:11:39.052 --> 01:11:42.974]  And then now they're going to start cutting the benefits back, and then means testing.
[01:11:43.674 --> 01:11:45.135]  Do you sterilize yourself?
[01:11:45.195 --> 01:11:46.436]  Do you take the vaccines?
[01:11:46.776 --> 01:11:51.379]  Do you volunteer, compulsory volunteer work for the different youth brigades?
[01:11:53.380 --> 01:11:54.021]  So there you go.
[01:11:54.101 --> 01:12:02.886]  Americans are the recipients of means-tested government benefits, have now outnumbered the total population of the Philippines.
[01:12:05.131 --> 01:12:12.159]  And I have more reports here where they are now telling workers, go get on welfare.
[01:12:12.339 --> 01:12:14.662]  This is the new American way.
[01:12:14.682 --> 01:12:16.104]  And then, oh!
[01:12:17.145 --> 01:12:21.470]  The Pentagon Secretary of the Army came out, as we reported last hour, Fox News, your name is reporting it.
[01:12:22.011 --> 01:12:23.713]  Infowars.com has the document.
[01:12:24.858 --> 01:12:27.259]  And they've come out and they've said, you know what?
[01:12:27.299 --> 01:12:32.941]  We are teaching that Christians are illegal and that praying and being an evangelical is illegal and we're going to arrest you.
[01:12:33.361 --> 01:12:35.942]  And we are teaching you can't be part of the Tea Party and we'll arrest you.
[01:12:37.262 --> 01:12:39.523]  And we're suspending that for now.
[01:12:43.344 --> 01:12:45.505]  This government is pure evil.
[01:12:46.650 --> 01:12:49.211]  But, oh, you woke up to it, so they're backing off.
[01:12:49.551 --> 01:12:50.391]  Oh, you're getting upset?
[01:12:50.411 --> 01:12:51.431]  Okay, don't worry.
[01:12:51.451 --> 01:12:52.151]  Keep the training going.
[01:12:52.171 --> 01:12:52.871]  Keep the training going.
[01:12:52.911 --> 01:12:53.852]  Find out who'll go with it.
[01:12:54.052 --> 01:12:56.512]  Kick out the others that don't, or send them into heavy combat.
[01:12:56.712 --> 01:12:57.792]  Double vaccines for them.
[01:12:58.113 --> 01:12:58.493]  Literally.
[01:12:58.973 --> 01:13:00.273]  You say you won't fire on Americans?
[01:13:00.453 --> 01:13:03.954]  You're sent to the worst hellhole, giving you hundreds of shots a year until you die.
[01:13:04.894 --> 01:13:08.355]  They've got it all actuaried out, and the guys giving you the shots don't even know it.
[01:13:08.395 --> 01:13:09.455]  Okay, I said I'd go to your calls.
[01:13:10.935 --> 01:13:13.576]  Let's go to this other little stack here on the healthcare news.
[01:13:15.273 --> 01:13:18.495]  Sebelius, I don't work for people who want me to resign.
[01:13:18.535 --> 01:13:23.739]  There's a video clip of this in the article up on InfoWars.com.
[01:13:23.799 --> 01:13:25.520]  National Review is reporting on it.
[01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:28.962]  She says, I don't work for people who want me to resign.
[01:13:31.184 --> 01:13:31.764]  No, she doesn't.
[01:13:31.844 --> 01:13:40.030]  She works for the 50 plus percent that are on welfare now who want to be euthanized and want to have the actual charity care gotten rid of.
[01:13:40.050 --> 01:13:44.412]  They just want something free, even if it's a bullet in the head, and they'll get it.
[01:13:44.473 --> 01:13:44.893]  Don't worry.
[01:13:46.138 --> 01:13:52.481]  Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius just responded moments ago.
[01:13:52.581 --> 01:14:03.805]  It reports in testimony that her goal is to actually see the website up and running, but that she doesn't work for people who want her to resign.
[01:14:04.186 --> 01:14:04.526]  Here you go.
[01:14:04.586 --> 01:14:05.246]  There's the arrogance.
[01:14:05.506 --> 01:14:06.086]  Here's another one.
[01:14:06.727 --> 01:14:09.848]  Democrats beginning to support Obamacare delays.
[01:14:10.248 --> 01:14:11.969]  Oh, like acting like that's a concession.
[01:14:12.249 --> 01:14:14.510]  You're never going to get the health care, stupid.
[01:14:16.351 --> 01:14:18.753]  If you're middle class, you're going to get your rates more than doubled.
[01:14:18.793 --> 01:14:21.936]  If you're poor, you're going to have to get insurance that's way overpriced.
[01:14:22.216 --> 01:14:23.697]  They're going to restrict the quality of care.
[01:14:23.717 --> 01:14:25.319]  I've been telling you this for six years.
[01:14:25.339 --> 01:14:28.542]  I've been telling you since they passed it three years ago.
[01:14:28.822 --> 01:14:30.503]  And of course, but you know what isn't delayed?
[01:14:33.186 --> 01:14:39.932]  What isn't delayed is they're going to garnish your wages, grab your bank account, and take your tax return refund, and it's now all been announced.
[01:14:40.811 --> 01:14:42.512]  It's all been announced now, I told you.
[01:14:43.012 --> 01:14:44.333]  And that part isn't being delayed.
[01:14:44.813 --> 01:14:48.455]  The part that's delayed is you getting health coverage, because you're never going to get that.
[01:14:48.935 --> 01:14:50.957]  I mean, if they had your way, you'd be dead.
[01:14:51.117 --> 01:14:51.597]  You understand?
[01:14:51.797 --> 01:14:59.821]  The elite thinks there's too many of us, and they're openly setting up a false system where there's scarce resources to socially engineer people.
[01:15:00.142 --> 01:15:01.963]  I'm going to try to explain it to folks again, okay?
[01:15:02.183 --> 01:15:05.905]  We have pure evil running things, and it's bigger than Obozo.
[01:15:07.691 --> 01:15:08.391]  Doesn't matter though.
[01:15:08.451 --> 01:15:09.792]  You'll know later.
[01:15:09.812 --> 01:15:12.152]  You'll remember this later.
[01:15:12.212 --> 01:15:13.113]  That's why we're going to win.
[01:15:13.133 --> 01:15:17.034]  Because even the most snot-nosed person out there later will remember.
[01:15:17.694 --> 01:15:19.794]  Remember you were warned.
[01:15:20.335 --> 01:15:23.035]  Others have heard me warn them and seen it come true, so they're listening now.
[01:15:23.515 --> 01:15:28.177]  You are particularly dumbed down, particularly arrogant, cognitive...
[01:15:28.897 --> 01:15:33.642]  Dissidence, learned helplessness, normalcy bias, mass Stockholm Syndrome.
[01:15:34.223 --> 01:15:40.169]  You will remember later though, submitting only increases the pain, fools.
[01:15:41.671 --> 01:15:42.632]  Let's continue here.
[01:15:42.892 --> 01:15:46.956]  Beware insurance pitches disguised as Obamacare.
[01:15:48.092 --> 01:15:54.438]  That's CBS News because all Obamacare is, is the insurance companies changing the law to totally rip you off.
[01:15:54.698 --> 01:15:58.262]  You think they ripped you off the last 50 years because they got government involved?
[01:15:58.522 --> 01:16:00.564]  Now the real gang raping is going to begin.
[01:16:01.567 --> 01:16:06.251]  Health insurance cancellation notices soar above Obamacare enrollment rates.
[01:16:06.812 --> 01:16:07.512]  Daily Caller.
[01:16:08.113 --> 01:16:12.577]  Another 76,000 customers will lose current coverage to Obamacare under Care First.
[01:16:12.897 --> 01:16:17.161]  They're making just dozens of announcements a day of just hundreds of thousands losing their health care.
[01:16:17.821 --> 01:16:19.603]  And it's increasing the price because it's affordable.
[01:16:20.043 --> 01:16:22.105]  And the Patriot Act is patriotic.
[01:16:23.366 --> 01:16:24.087]  Let's continue.
[01:16:24.727 --> 01:16:26.269]  Again, it's Orwellian speak, folks.
[01:16:26.309 --> 01:16:26.869]  War is peace.
[01:16:26.909 --> 01:16:27.610]  Slavery is freedom.
[01:16:28.806 --> 01:16:29.547]  Ignorance is strength.
[01:16:30.247 --> 01:16:32.970]  Majority of Americans want healthcare mandate delayed.
[01:16:33.190 --> 01:16:37.153]  They don't get, they're just gonna delay you having to go out and get the insurance.
[01:16:37.574 --> 01:16:39.135]  The increased rates are already there.
[01:16:39.175 --> 01:16:40.116]  That was always the plan.
[01:16:40.136 --> 01:16:42.198]  That's why the insurance companies wrote this and lobbied.
[01:16:42.498 --> 01:16:44.240]  It wasn't a deal with Obama.
[01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:46.542]  He was put in there by these people.
[01:16:48.644 --> 01:16:51.666]  It's like snot-nosed Romney was gonna do it or Obama was gonna do it.
[01:16:52.987 --> 01:16:54.288]  Ten Senate Democrats
[01:16:55.572 --> 01:16:59.434]  Signed she hand letter pushing for open enrollment extension.
[01:17:00.794 --> 01:17:03.176]  Healthcare.gov problems are target of ill hearing.
[01:17:03.536 --> 01:17:05.617]  Yeah, they'll now discuss their whole engineered program.
[01:17:06.337 --> 01:17:10.559]  Dummy data file on healthcare.gov offers Star Wars Transformers characters.
[01:17:10.579 --> 01:17:12.300]  It's all total a joke.
[01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:18.142]  CIA funded software company manages private data for healthcare.gov.
[01:17:18.623 --> 01:17:23.685]  In-Q-Tel run and funded by the CIA is the group that set it all up.
[01:17:24.775 --> 01:17:27.718]  Told you that a while back, but now that's mainstream news.
[01:17:29.260 --> 01:17:30.802]  InfoWars.com is reporting on it.
[01:17:31.203 --> 01:17:32.144]  And it's in a press release.
[01:17:32.164 --> 01:17:32.864]  They're very proud of it.
[01:17:33.886 --> 01:17:36.168]  The CIA run to...
[01:17:38.183 --> 01:17:43.245]  I mean, they can't kill you like they did with Mao, who worked for them right away, so they'll... I mean, this is the next best thing.
[01:17:43.825 --> 01:17:46.286]  To kill the country, kill our industry, kill our jobs.
[01:17:46.626 --> 01:17:52.248]  Healthcare.gov now deliberately displaying false pricing information to trick the public.
[01:17:52.588 --> 01:17:52.908]  J.D.
[01:17:52.948 --> 01:17:57.270]  Hayes at Natural News reports, and it just goes over the whole situation.
[01:17:57.290 --> 01:17:58.751]  Now they've got false data.
[01:17:58.771 --> 01:17:59.491]  Yeah, it's a total...
[01:18:00.231 --> 01:18:00.972]  It's a scam system.
[01:18:01.012 --> 01:18:01.793]  It's not broken.
[01:18:02.253 --> 01:18:10.320]  It's meant so all these idiots go enter their data and then get put in a CIA, NSA database to have your bank account taken and to have your tax refund taken.
[01:18:11.321 --> 01:18:11.722]  And why not?
[01:18:11.762 --> 01:18:12.602]  You'll be all alone.
[01:18:13.363 --> 01:18:15.365]  And by the time you figure it out, Obama will leave.
[01:18:15.405 --> 01:18:18.968]  The next puppet will come in and you'll be angry and the cops know you're going to be angry.
[01:18:19.188 --> 01:18:22.732]  They've got Homeland Security, riot police ready in every city.
[01:18:24.107 --> 01:18:26.929]  They've got the armored vehicles ready, the surveillance grids ready, everything.
[01:18:27.089 --> 01:18:28.150]  They're going to cut everything off.
[01:18:28.170 --> 01:18:32.633]  And they're going to start cutting your welfare now, because they've got it all set up where there aren't jobs anyways.
[01:18:32.913 --> 01:18:35.755]  They use the welfare takeover to burn down the economy.
[01:18:36.035 --> 01:18:37.376]  Now they're going to cut the chicken feed.
[01:18:37.616 --> 01:18:38.577]  Then you're going to riot.
[01:18:38.757 --> 01:18:40.278]  Then they're going to bring in martial law.
[01:18:40.438 --> 01:18:43.340]  It's called the IMF 112-point plan.
[01:18:44.581 --> 01:18:44.981]  Look it up.
[01:18:46.162 --> 01:18:47.123]  It's all planned.
[01:18:47.323 --> 01:18:49.705]  It's all been done lovingly to other cheap
[01:18:50.558 --> 01:18:51.541]  You're gonna be butchered.
[01:18:51.621 --> 01:18:52.523]  You know you want it.
[01:18:52.583 --> 01:18:53.486]  You know you love it.
[01:18:53.787 --> 01:18:54.890]  You know you enjoy it.
[01:18:55.110 --> 01:18:58.058]  You're going to get what you want, Trendy's.
[01:18:59.909 --> 01:19:02.370]  So go enroll for college for something you'll never get a job with.
[01:19:02.631 --> 01:19:03.451]  Go into debt.
[01:19:04.071 --> 01:19:06.073]  Go get adjustable arm rate mortgages.
[01:19:06.113 --> 01:19:06.913]  Get ripped off.
[01:19:07.213 --> 01:19:08.534]  Give your kids all the shots.
[01:19:09.234 --> 01:19:10.155]  Put them in coffins.
[01:19:10.235 --> 01:19:10.795]  Bury them.
[01:19:11.035 --> 01:19:11.856]  Drink fluoride.
[01:19:11.916 --> 01:19:12.576]  Get cancer.
[01:19:12.636 --> 01:19:13.017]  Die.
[01:19:13.297 --> 01:19:14.237]  Worship government.
[01:19:14.517 --> 01:19:15.878]  Worship your loving government.
[01:19:16.178 --> 01:19:19.100]  Don't wear a cowboy or Indian outfit.
[01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:20.701]  They're saying it's racist.
[01:19:20.721 --> 01:19:21.782]  They're trying to pass laws.
[01:19:23.062 --> 01:19:24.583]  Don't pack your kid a school lunch.
[01:19:24.943 --> 01:19:25.564]  It's racist.
[01:19:26.124 --> 01:19:27.465]  The school says you're not allowed to do it.
[01:19:29.571 --> 01:19:37.435]  And whatever you do, whatever you do, remember the state is God and the state will run your life.
[01:19:37.455 --> 01:19:48.900]  We're going to come back with Mark Dice for a couple of segments, then I'm going to go to Eric in Canada who's been holding, and I'm going to go to Sam and Ben and Alan and many others that are patiently holding.
[01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:50.801]  I want to get Mark to pop in as a media analyst to
[01:19:59.366 --> 01:20:08.187]  Talk about a piece he did last week out talking to the Californians when he said we're gonna bring in Nazi fascism for Obama and they almost all of them signed it.
[01:20:08.828 --> 01:20:09.348]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:10.488 --> 01:20:16.089]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[01:20:16.229 --> 01:20:23.470]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[01:20:23.610 --> 01:20:26.891]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[01:20:26.951 --> 01:20:28.711]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[01:20:28.971 --> 01:20:33.533]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.

[01:22:23.925 --> 01:22:34.013]  Genetically modified crops, processed foods, and toxic chemicals can compromise your health and are silently destroying your digestive system, which accounts for 80% of your immune system.

[01:24:14.895 --> 01:24:31.046]  We're petitioning to just keep the police state and implement some more Orwellian measures to keep the community safe.
[01:24:32.046 --> 01:24:36.089]  And signature, too, for the Nazi-style police state.
[01:24:36.129 --> 01:24:39.952]  The budget cuts are just causing all kinds of problems, so thanks for supporting that.
[01:24:43.435 --> 01:24:56.788]  They're closing parks, they're closing campgrounds and now they're trying to cut back on the police state and so we want to just increase the Orwellian system and a signature to support that.
[01:24:57.068 --> 01:24:59.631]  Thank you for the support on the police state.
[01:25:04.229 --> 01:25:07.371]  This is to support the Orwellian police state.
[01:25:07.491 --> 01:25:14.437]  We just want to model it after the Nazi Germany system to keep people safe and secure.
[01:25:14.557 --> 01:25:18.560]  So, thank you for signing the petition to support the police state.
[01:25:18.580 --> 01:25:19.840]  These are Californians.
[01:25:21.342 --> 01:25:22.643]  They are the model of zombie.
[01:25:24.384 --> 01:25:24.724]  Wow.
[01:25:25.505 --> 01:25:27.006]  Am I not making myself clear?
[01:25:28.109 --> 01:25:40.472]  Because of the budget restraints, the police state's having some problems, so we're just going to petition City Council to increase the signature there to support the Orwellian Police State.
[01:25:40.512 --> 01:25:42.653]  We want to just implement it a little bit more.
[01:25:42.913 --> 01:25:44.173]  Yeah, if you find the money, though.
[01:25:44.773 --> 01:25:45.654]  We'll find it somewhere.
[01:25:46.294 --> 01:25:46.654]  Thank you.
[01:25:48.789 --> 01:25:53.492]  We're petitioning the City Council to increase the police state.
[01:25:54.312 --> 01:25:57.494]  Just a print there and a birthday too.
[01:25:58.014 --> 01:26:04.017]  We want to model it after the Nazi Germany style police state.
[01:26:04.077 --> 01:26:08.700]  Now, DrudgeReport.com last week ran with our InfoWars.com article about this.
[01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:14.543]  And I think it's important for you to understand, if you go to Democrat areas in your city,
[01:26:16.363 --> 01:26:17.644]  And I'm not even a Republican, folks.
[01:26:17.664 --> 01:26:18.225]  You know that.
[01:26:18.545 --> 01:26:22.609]  I'm just saying the Democrats are the model of dumbed-down, submissive slave.
[01:26:23.409 --> 01:26:36.261]  If we go to Democratic areas of Austin, they sign the same thing to make Austin Nazi Germany for Obama, to put gun owners in camps for Obama, to ban water for Obama, to make people wear helmets on their heads for safety.
[01:26:36.721 --> 01:26:39.384]  If you say, for safety, for the children, for Obama,
[01:26:40.299 --> 01:26:49.821]  I want to send my crew out and literally say, we want to, well we already said kill babies up to age three for Obama, but how about throw babies in wood chippers live for Obama.
[01:26:50.641 --> 01:26:51.542]  Or something like that.
[01:26:52.262 --> 01:26:55.302]  Or throw babies to pit bulls to be eaten for Obama.
[01:26:55.803 --> 01:26:56.483]  They will sign it.
[01:26:57.403 --> 01:26:58.063]  I'm not joking.
[01:26:58.343 --> 01:27:06.005]  If you say for Obama, that might be a good pick up line if you're, you know, walk up to a woman who's an Obama supporter and say, come home with me immediately for Obama.
[01:27:06.900 --> 01:27:08.960]  And I mean, maybe that's what this is all about.
[01:27:09.001 --> 01:27:10.241]  I mean, it's like programming.
[01:27:10.841 --> 01:27:11.421]  And they do it.
[01:27:11.441 --> 01:27:16.842]  And you have to understand, when we show these, and when Mark does it, he'll go out for 15 minutes.
[01:27:18.063 --> 01:27:21.483]  And we're not cherry-picking folks.
[01:27:22.484 --> 01:27:23.744]  This is really what happened.
[01:27:24.344 --> 01:27:31.646]  So Mark, we're going to break in a minute, and also we'll talk about a TV show that aired last night nationally that you were on that I'm surprised actually covered Bohemian Grove and Skull & Bones.
[01:27:31.986 --> 01:27:32.566]  So good job.
[01:27:33.746 --> 01:27:38.294]  On that front, but Mark, I mean, is there nothing they won't sign?
[01:27:39.665 --> 01:27:45.347]  These crazy petitions, I've been doing them for about nine months now, and it's sort of just repealing the Second Amendment.
[01:27:45.507 --> 01:27:52.310]  During the gun debate, I thought, let's see if we could get people to just repeal the Second Amendment and do gun confiscations.
[01:27:52.350 --> 01:27:55.791]  And it was no problem, door-to-door gun confiscations.
[01:27:56.131 --> 01:27:58.572]  And I just kept doing it, more and more outrageous.
[01:27:58.852 --> 01:28:04.274]  Let's ban pressure cookers from, let's ban Muslims from buying pressure cookers to keep people safe.
[01:28:04.634 --> 01:28:09.778]  Let's ban black backpacks because the Boston Bombers used black backpacks.
[01:28:10.438 --> 01:28:14.281]  Statistics show that the terrorists used black backpacks.
[01:28:14.681 --> 01:28:18.744]  Let's ban butcher knives and show people an article of someone killed by one.
[01:28:18.904 --> 01:28:20.245]  They're actually trying that in England.
[01:28:21.004 --> 01:28:25.869]  There's one video that I haven't posted yet that is the only concept that didn't really work.
[01:28:25.929 --> 01:28:31.895]  I mean, it would have worked, it just would have taken maybe three times the amount of opportunities to show.
[01:28:32.375 --> 01:28:37.380]  The videos, I only show half the people in the videos because three, four, five minutes, you get the point.
[01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:42.645]  An eight, nine, ten minute video of the same thing over and over again, it's gonna be a little redundant.
[01:28:42.685 --> 01:28:45.488]  Yeah, let's be clear, you could show a lot more of these people.
[01:28:46.195 --> 01:28:48.396]  Oh, I could show probably two or three times as many.
[01:28:48.737 --> 01:28:53.820]  Sometimes there's some audio problems, a little bit of static with people's cell phones, with the wireless mic and everything.
[01:28:54.180 --> 01:28:57.182]  But for the most part, I'm showing probably half of the people.
[01:28:57.702 --> 01:29:01.564]  And like you said, if you just mention those key words, will you support Obama?
[01:29:01.724 --> 01:29:09.529]  I mean, as some of your audience knows, as you know, I've got them to sign petitions to repeal the First Amendment, the second, the fourth,
[01:29:11.049 --> 01:29:16.932]  And by the way, my crew has been out with you multiple times and witnessed it themselves, and we've done it in Austin.
[01:29:17.292 --> 01:29:18.453]  This is on record.
[01:29:19.693 --> 01:29:21.234]  Of course, now, Mark, we're going to break.
[01:29:21.254 --> 01:29:22.975]  We're going to get your take on this when we come back.
[01:29:23.915 --> 01:29:30.218]  They're saying they're going to arrest people that are evangelical or give money to the Tea Party who are in the military.
[01:29:30.938 --> 01:29:32.899]  I mean, that shows these are authoritarians.
[01:29:34.272 --> 01:29:41.015]  And the population's willing to do literally anything, sign their name, birthdate, and signature to the policy, no matter how crazy it sounds.
[01:29:41.416 --> 01:29:43.036]  This is the zombie plague.
[01:29:43.197 --> 01:29:44.077]  It's spreading.
[01:29:44.477 --> 01:29:47.759]  We can stop it, but it's going to be a tough, tough uphill battle.
[01:29:47.779 --> 01:29:51.421]  Well, the thing is, I've also noticed if you try to wake the zombies up, they then just call you racist.
[01:29:51.761 --> 01:29:54.802]  You could be talking about the weather, and their response is racist.
[01:29:55.183 --> 01:29:57.304]  So that's what the zombie chirps, it's called.
[01:29:57.704 --> 01:29:59.685]  It's like, racist, racist, racist.
[01:29:59.705 --> 01:30:00.225]  We're on the march.
[01:30:00.245 --> 01:30:03.287]  Instead of like a sheep baaing, it's like, racist, racist.
[01:30:10.468 --> 01:30:14.449]  When an emergency happens, you'll be left to fend for yourself and your family.
[01:30:14.769 --> 01:30:20.351]  An outbreak of contagious disease can happen anywhere, and the threat of bioterrorism is always at hand.
[01:30:20.651 --> 01:30:26.052]  Because we're faced with more diseases than ever before, we need a better solution than ever before.
[01:30:26.452 --> 01:30:29.973]  Fortunately, there's a simple, effective way to protect yourself.

[01:32:10.225 --> 01:32:15.812]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[01:32:16.013 --> 01:32:23.242]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[01:32:23.402 --> 01:32:26.646]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[01:32:26.766 --> 01:32:28.529]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[01:32:28.769 --> 01:32:33.333]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[01:32:33.433 --> 01:32:36.195]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[01:32:36.355 --> 01:32:42.139]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[01:32:42.300 --> 01:32:45.782]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[01:32:45.982 --> 01:32:51.046]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine.
[01:32:51.227 --> 01:32:54.209]  Exclusively available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:32:54.449 --> 01:33:00.313]  Nascent Iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.
[01:33:00.433 --> 01:33:02.414]  Survival Shield Nascent Iodine.
[01:33:02.594 --> 01:33:08.018]  Secure your super high quality Nascent Iodine today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:33:08.098 --> 01:33:09.478]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:33:22.603 --> 01:33:27.344]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:27.564 --> 01:33:28.825]  All the hip young things!
[01:33:51.016 --> 01:33:53.277]  Know that Obama is their king.
[01:33:55.938 --> 01:34:01.041]  And the number one rule of the modern age is don't think, just feel trendy.
[01:34:02.262 --> 01:34:06.504]  And sign on to anything as long as it's for big government and the loving state.
[01:34:08.685 --> 01:34:12.607]  And of course they got a rude awakening coming once the globalists fully take over.
[01:34:13.007 --> 01:34:15.088]  Just like they do in every other collectivist country.
[01:34:15.488 --> 01:34:16.669]  There's not going to be any welfare.
[01:34:17.529 --> 01:34:30.137]  It's going to be Foxconn slave factories with suicide nets, forced abortions, and mobile execution vans until they've got the robots in place, which is only about 10 to 15 years out for pretty much total conversion to robots.
[01:34:30.518 --> 01:34:32.279]  The French want to have it done in six years.
[01:34:34.232 --> 01:34:36.093]  Then the bioweapons gonna get released.
[01:34:36.453 --> 01:34:42.254]  The minute the robots are in and working, they're only there to take our jobs, get us dependent on government.
[01:34:42.555 --> 01:34:43.755]  They're gonna be scrapped as well.
[01:34:45.075 --> 01:34:47.136]  This is a high-tech form of warfare.
[01:34:47.516 --> 01:34:50.897]  I cover it in my film, Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[01:34:51.297 --> 01:34:53.118]  And the reason I laugh is it's so painful.
[01:34:53.498 --> 01:34:56.579]  And I just think of how naive the general public is and has no idea.
[01:34:57.279 --> 01:35:00.521]  Uh, the technocracy they're facing and that it's all public.
[01:35:00.741 --> 01:35:02.622]  It's all in white papers, the total plan.
[01:35:03.182 --> 01:35:04.162]  I've made films about it.
[01:35:04.202 --> 01:35:05.743]  We've broken down the plannedopolis.
[01:35:06.143 --> 01:35:13.087]  Every word I tell you, by the way, you can go look up and then find just volumes in their own words on their battle plan for you and your family.
[01:35:14.275 --> 01:35:25.425]  So, you can either roll over and die and laugh at me or you can stand up and research this and find out I'm telling you the truth and then call me up hyperventilating and saying, it's worse, worse, worse, worse, worse than you said.
[01:35:25.765 --> 01:35:27.426]  Yes, I know it's worse than I said.
[01:35:27.887 --> 01:35:29.228]  I can't believe I'm still alive.
[01:35:29.288 --> 01:35:32.351]  I can't believe we're at this level having this big of an effect.
[01:35:34.252 --> 01:35:39.197]  But it shows there's still forces of good in the universe and evil hasn't fully converted over yet.
[01:35:39.297 --> 01:35:40.257]  But it's getting close.
[01:35:40.778 --> 01:35:41.699]  We're in grave danger.
[01:35:43.166 --> 01:35:46.910]  We're going to go back to Mark Dice in a moment and get into some other issues with him as well on your phone calls.
[01:35:47.570 --> 01:36:02.124]  Remember, we're listener-supported, and what I do is I go out and I find the very best products out there that I use and that I have a great effect from, like the best clean seaweed, pure brown seaweed extract, Modifilin,
[01:36:02.885 --> 01:36:04.486]  Uh, from the Southern Hemisphere.
[01:36:04.907 --> 01:36:06.268]  Uh, we've had this, uh, tested.
[01:36:06.328 --> 01:36:08.170]  The group that we've got it from has it tested.
[01:36:08.190 --> 01:36:10.612]  Uh, this is about the cleanest seaweed you can find out there.
[01:36:10.632 --> 01:36:13.994]  I say about the cleanest, because we don't know if there's cleaner out there that somebody hadn't found.
[01:36:14.355 --> 01:36:15.115]  This is what I take.
[01:36:15.135 --> 01:36:16.176]  It's what my family takes.
[01:36:16.336 --> 01:36:16.977]  It's incredible.
[01:36:17.277 --> 01:36:29.788]  And then I began to research the nascent iodine that's naturally in it, and found the ultimate, from our research, InfoWars Survival Shield, proprietary, patented form of nascent iodine.
[01:36:31.089 --> 01:36:33.551]  And I've finally been allowed to know how it's actually made.
[01:36:33.571 --> 01:36:34.452]  That's a secret.
[01:36:34.792 --> 01:36:35.773]  It's incredible.
[01:36:35.833 --> 01:36:37.494]  Russian scientists, the whole nine yards.
[01:36:37.754 --> 01:36:38.635]  It's made in Utah.
[01:36:39.195 --> 01:36:41.117]  And it is Tesla-type stuff.
[01:36:41.137 --> 01:36:41.918]  That's all I'm going to tell you.
[01:36:42.478 --> 01:36:43.499]  I'm not allowed to say any more.
[01:36:44.199 --> 01:36:45.400]  The point is, this is it.
[01:36:45.961 --> 01:36:46.861]  And it's sold out.
[01:36:47.002 --> 01:36:48.683]  They are making more for me right now.
[01:36:48.723 --> 01:36:50.284]  They can't believe how much of it we sold.
[01:36:50.845 --> 01:36:53.367]  Not even that much, really, in the aggregate for a company like this.
[01:36:53.467 --> 01:36:54.608]  It's more like a laboratory.
[01:36:55.448 --> 01:36:56.828]  Uh, so you can pre-order it.
[01:36:57.089 --> 01:37:00.389]  It'll be in in a couple weeks, really probably a week or so, but I don't want to say that.
[01:37:00.409 --> 01:37:01.510]  I need time to ship it out.
[01:37:02.350 --> 01:37:12.693]  Uh, so if you want to get in line and the pre-order, we're saying two to three weeks, uh, InfoWarsLife.com takes you right to the sub page of InfoWarsStore.com where you can find the modify one.
[01:37:13.673 --> 01:37:17.914]  And the Survival Shield and so much more at Infowarslife.com.
[01:37:17.934 --> 01:37:19.915]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[01:37:20.475 --> 01:37:25.036]  And we fund our operation with Pro Pure Water Filters discounted with promo code WATER.
[01:37:25.996 --> 01:37:28.076]  With 10% off, the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[01:37:28.096 --> 01:37:29.337]  We did the research, looked into it.
[01:37:29.697 --> 01:37:30.517]  That's what we carry.
[01:37:30.757 --> 01:37:34.618]  I didn't sell a water filter for a year because I couldn't find one that was high enough quality.
[01:37:34.918 --> 01:37:37.799]  Now we sell four different brands, but this is the top one.
[01:37:38.119 --> 01:37:40.539]  Promo code WATER to get the biggest discount anywhere.
[01:37:40.879 --> 01:37:41.720]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:37:43.340 --> 01:37:44.802]  Or the nascent iodine.
[01:37:45.122 --> 01:37:49.407]  Infowarstore.com for the books, the films, the t-shirts, the magazine, everything else.
[01:37:50.128 --> 01:37:50.889]  Right there on the site.
[01:37:55.922 --> 01:37:59.384]  All right, folks, we're going to go back to Mark Dice now.
[01:37:59.404 --> 01:38:00.765]  That was a short segment.
[01:38:01.085 --> 01:38:06.309]  Mark, getting back into the zombiosis, this is quite frightening, and everybody should be concerned.
[01:38:06.329 --> 01:38:10.892]  It should be not just National News and Infowars.com or DrugsReport.com.
[01:38:11.412 --> 01:38:15.575]  This should be discussed on ABC News, NBC News, but they don't want to do that.
[01:38:15.895 --> 01:38:17.156]  This is their target audience.
[01:38:18.260 --> 01:38:20.841]  This is why they teach Common Core 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[01:38:21.441 --> 01:38:22.882]  I feel like a liar when I say that.
[01:38:22.902 --> 01:38:23.562]  It's on record.
[01:38:23.922 --> 01:38:25.502]  They teach 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[01:38:26.203 --> 01:38:30.084]  Now you can't pack lunches under Obamacare and under Michelle's control.
[01:38:30.464 --> 01:38:36.206]  Nationwide, the announcement's being made from Virginia to California that you can't pack lunch, period, for your children.
[01:38:36.446 --> 01:38:37.866]  They will eat deadly GMO.
[01:38:38.127 --> 01:38:39.307]  They will eat aspartame.
[01:38:39.687 --> 01:38:42.248]  I mean, they're now taking the velvet glove off
[01:38:43.208 --> 01:38:46.529]  And taking the cloaking device off and really telling us you're a prisoner.
[01:38:46.849 --> 01:38:52.010]  What do you make of the military saying you will not be evangelical or we will arrest you?
[01:38:52.290 --> 01:38:53.611]  And the Army now admits that.
[01:38:54.131 --> 01:38:58.872]  The Secretary of the Army has come out and said well that is being taught and it shouldn't be.
[01:38:58.892 --> 01:39:01.973]  I mean the magnitude of this.
[01:39:02.113 --> 01:39:03.233]  How evil these people are.
[01:39:04.409 --> 01:39:16.443]  The New World Order obviously is aiming to destroy our culture, to keep everybody out of the way so that they can do whatever they want to do in the government and evolve into their Luciferian god and prepare the planet really for their Illuminati messiah.
[01:39:16.463 --> 01:39:19.847]  So dumbing down the culture is obviously working.
[01:39:19.887 --> 01:39:22.510]  It is a zombie apocalypse and we've been using that.
[01:39:22.830 --> 01:39:25.232]  I don't know if that's the right terminology for years, but it's virtually true.
[01:39:25.673 --> 01:39:38.324]  And these petitions that I've been doing over the last year show that people will approve and stamp their name on the most ridiculous things or simply just not pay any attention, just believe the line that they're told about what it is.
[01:39:38.965 --> 01:39:40.206]  Not critically thinking for itself.
[01:39:40.246 --> 01:39:53.841]  So if I can get these people to sign petitions to repeal the Bill of Rights, to support a Nazi-style Orwellian police state, to ban black backpacks, to just do these ridiculous things that nobody in their right mind should even consider.
[01:39:54.181 --> 01:39:59.407]  Occasionally you can see people cracking a smile and busting out laughing and realizing what I'm doing, and I show them in the videos.
[01:39:59.827 --> 01:40:01.489]  But the vast majority of the people
[01:40:01.949 --> 01:40:08.995]  Are virtually walking, mindless, mentally enslaved, mainstream media watching and music listening morons.
[01:40:09.455 --> 01:40:11.917]  And that's why these people will do whatever it takes.
[01:40:12.177 --> 01:40:21.204]  That's why they'll round up the Christians at some point and point the finger at us because we're trying to preserve the culture and prevent it from getting sucked down this Hollywood vortex.
[01:40:21.604 --> 01:40:24.767]  This do what thou wilt, social Darwinistic
[01:40:25.427 --> 01:40:43.297]  Sin is in culture, and so that's why Christians are seen as the problem, because we are the last stitches holding this society, the fabric of society together, before the Orwellian Illuminati plan is able to just unroll without any opposition.
[01:40:43.317 --> 01:40:48.920]  That's right, and they're going to come to our farms, they're going to come to our apartments and our homes, and they've said they're going to take our children
[01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:54.861]  And Jocelyn Elder said this, they're going to take our three-year-olds and take them into a public area and grab their genitals.
[01:40:55.541 --> 01:40:57.661]  Jocelyn Elder said, reach down and show them how to do it.
[01:40:57.681 --> 01:40:58.522]  I mean, play that clip.
[01:40:59.142 --> 01:41:01.282]  And people say, well, why are they into that?
[01:41:01.562 --> 01:41:09.464]  Because if you read the Bible or any other history, the Bible it's been confirmed, especially the New Testament, is history by the Roman historians and others.
[01:41:10.024 --> 01:41:11.784]  Very accurate about what went on in those times.
[01:41:12.164 --> 01:41:15.245]  Every corrupt culture didn't just say, we want to rape your kids.
[01:41:15.605 --> 01:41:17.145]  We want to burn them to an idol.
[01:41:17.805 --> 01:41:23.190]  The Druids, the Aztecs, societies follow a decadence arc.
[01:41:23.910 --> 01:41:33.338]  That's why we see Hollywood putting out movies like Hostel and all these horror movies where the worse, the more graphic, the more violent, the more disgusting, these Saw films, the more the audience likes it.
[01:41:33.738 --> 01:41:34.139]  Purge.
[01:41:34.759 --> 01:41:44.646]  Oh yeah, it's just everybody likes to go and watch, the majority of the brain-dead American public loves to go and watch these movies and lives vicariously through the audience or through the characters murdering these people.
[01:41:44.686 --> 01:41:47.348]  That's how disgusting and decadent our culture is.
[01:41:47.368 --> 01:41:54.393]  That's right, the murderers are now the good guys, but then if you say something to these people, they're offended and call the police on you.
[01:41:54.553 --> 01:42:00.578]  So they grovel in fear of any type of goodness or freedom, but then they fantasize that they're raping children.
[01:42:01.178 --> 01:42:11.732]  We have Illuminati icons like Miley Cyrus, who I call Miley Virus, an Illuminati icon of evil, literally teaching the children how to pop ecstasy.
[01:42:11.812 --> 01:42:14.575]  I mean, she's literally singing about popping ecstasy and partying.
[01:42:14.655 --> 01:42:18.861]  And this was all planned to make her a child star, bait the hook, get everyone in, yes.
[01:42:19.281 --> 01:42:21.464]  And she's on all the family-friendly shows.
[01:42:21.964 --> 01:42:32.456]  In a perfect world, in a sane world, Good Morning America, Ellen, all of these seemingly family-friendly talk shows would shun such a satanic skank and would have nothing to do with her.
[01:42:32.736 --> 01:42:36.680]  But instead, the mainstream media monopoly, this Illuminati-controlled
[01:42:37.381 --> 01:42:42.847]  Mind-controlling machine promotes these people, puts them on all the magazines, puts them on all the shows.
[01:42:43.128 --> 01:42:51.557]  I can't even go to the gym without listening to this pop culture port-a-potty, just these gargoyles pumping their...
[01:42:52.638 --> 01:42:53.539]  Urine stream.
[01:42:53.699 --> 01:42:55.300]  The mainstream media is a urine stream.
[01:43:23.238 --> 01:43:33.462]  Well, the ultimate endgame is to have a massive lower class of people that suck off of what's left of the middle class, the producing class, in order to create a bigger bureaucracy.
[01:43:33.482 --> 01:43:34.963]  I'm sorry, a bureaucracy.
[01:43:34.983 --> 01:43:36.644]  It is a bureaucracy at this point.
[01:43:37.404 --> 01:43:49.609]  To create an entitlement class, an ineptocracy, where you have a small percentage of people that are working and trying to work hard and get ahead and raise their family and maintain some sort of a positive image in the culture.
[01:43:50.509 --> 01:44:14.187]  To suck their wealth, to give it to those who don't work, who don't care, to then enslave those people so that you can't get ahead, you can't retire, you can't take that vacation, you can't go to take a couple days off to go and protest, so that you are enslaved to your own job while the lower class, the mentally enslaved welfare class, is then leeching off of those producers.
[01:44:14.387 --> 01:44:18.330]  And it's ultimately to produce a literal satanic society.
[01:44:18.350 --> 01:44:19.431]  That's why we have these Illuminati
[01:44:19.991 --> 01:44:20.892]  I don't
[01:44:35.486 --> 01:44:38.309]  It's just real old-fashioned classic rock or heavy metal.
[01:44:38.470 --> 01:44:41.053]  When you really listen to it, a lot of it's actually anti-Satan.
[01:44:41.313 --> 01:44:42.674]  It's just really heavy and male.
[01:44:43.115 --> 01:44:47.180]  This stuff is satanic, is Illuminati, has all the proper symbols.
[01:44:47.240 --> 01:44:49.262]  It's not even, you know, old-fashioned bathymet stuff.
[01:44:49.743 --> 01:44:52.046]  It is targeting directly at little girls.
[01:44:52.657 --> 01:44:54.818]  You got Rihanna, one of the biggest pop stars in the world.
[01:44:54.859 --> 01:44:59.902]  I mean, she has a music video out called S&M, sadomasochism, and she's dressed up in bondage.
[01:45:00.242 --> 01:45:06.086]  Looks like she's about to get gang-banged by a bunch of dudes on a dirty mattress with a bunch of Big Brother Orwellian cameras.
[01:45:06.406 --> 01:45:12.891]  In another video, she's dancing around on the floor in what looks to be a satanic pentagram painted on the floor in satanic Baphomet devil horns.
[01:45:13.311 --> 01:45:17.634]  This is what your kids are being taught to idolize and mimic, and we have Ken
[01:45:17.674 --> 01:45:27.741]  And the issue is, it's not even an issue now, but expanding on this, it's not because they're going to give us some heavenly world where, you know, the guys all have fun with the devil cheerleaders.
[01:45:28.222 --> 01:45:29.463]  That's just bait on the hook.
[01:45:29.943 --> 01:45:31.904]  It's in the communist goals.
[01:45:31.964 --> 01:45:32.685]  In fact, I have them right here.
[01:45:32.705 --> 01:45:33.786]  I'm going to go over some of those with you.
[01:45:34.366 --> 01:45:42.769]  It is in the goals openly that were put in the congressional record to destroy us morally so we will stand down and be enslaved.
[01:45:43.069 --> 01:45:45.710]  And this isn't just communist enslavement to be physical slaves.
[01:45:46.030 --> 01:45:48.511]  This is for the World Population Reduction Program.
[01:45:49.667 --> 01:45:52.769]  Well, ultimately, it's a hedonistic, do-what-thou-wilt society.
[01:45:52.809 --> 01:46:02.754]  I mean, at some point when this Luciferian, Illuminati, Antichrist, their supposed Messiah appears, the reason Christians are going to be demonized is because we're going to be the ones that are saying, wait a minute, that is wrong.
[01:46:02.914 --> 01:46:03.855]  You shouldn't be doing that.
[01:46:04.075 --> 01:46:05.315]  We want to preserve a family.
[01:46:05.355 --> 01:46:06.656]  We have family values.
[01:46:06.676 --> 01:46:08.817]  So we are seen as the enemy.
[01:46:08.837 --> 01:46:15.040]  And so that's why they're poisoning the culture through these pop stars, through the mentally enslaving mainstream media.
[01:46:15.061 --> 01:46:15.621]  And that's right.
[01:46:16.221 --> 01:46:26.552]  And now they've got giant, drooling, satanic welfare hordes, who openly, people call it all the time, I see it in the news, principals will tell fathers, your kids belong to us, now get out of here!
[01:46:27.212 --> 01:46:28.834]  And the cops are just sitting there with their weapons.
[01:46:29.915 --> 01:46:33.398]  I mean, it is pure evil, and they know it's their time.
[01:46:35.260 --> 01:46:43.268]  If you don't have a family structure, you don't have a father, a mother, aunts and uncles, grandparents to show you support, to teach you, then you see the government as God.
[01:46:43.288 --> 01:46:55.601]  You see the government as your big brother and that's of course their plan to destroy the family, to create people a welfare state, an entitlement class, a cradle-to-grave nanny state, where the government is your God.
[01:46:55.621 --> 01:46:57.943]  The government provides everything that you need.
[01:46:58.163 --> 01:46:58.883]  Not your family.
[01:46:59.183 --> 01:47:00.644]  You don't need to work for it yourself.
[01:47:00.924 --> 01:47:03.544]  The government will give it to you if you follow in line.
[01:47:03.804 --> 01:47:08.365]  Which is extremely surprising about the pop star, the mainstream media machine.
[01:47:08.845 --> 01:47:12.126]  It's completely surprising that I was able to appear on the E!
[01:47:12.146 --> 01:47:15.187]  Channel, the entertainment channel, last night in Secret Societies of Hollywood.
[01:47:15.827 --> 01:47:24.228]  A kind of a salacious, a scandalous look at Hollywood sex clubs and the drug dealing and the private parties, the bondage things.
[01:47:24.248 --> 01:47:26.929]  But they did at the very end of this two-hour special
[01:47:27.529 --> 01:47:33.454]  Actually include me talking about the Bilderberg Group and the Bohemian Grove in a pretty fair way.
[01:47:33.834 --> 01:47:35.516]  And people are wondering, hey, how can this happen?
[01:47:35.576 --> 01:47:36.657]  How could you get on the TV?
[01:47:37.437 --> 01:47:42.181]  Because entertainment shows like this don't have the gatekeepers that hard news do.
[01:47:42.421 --> 01:47:44.123]  You see, the Illuminati is not all powerful.
[01:47:44.163 --> 01:47:45.864]  People think that they have all power.
[01:47:45.904 --> 01:47:46.945]  No, they're very powerful.
[01:47:47.185 --> 01:47:48.606]  But they don't have their tentacles wrapped around.
[01:47:48.646 --> 01:47:59.189]  Well, I want to be clear because I've been watching this as well from the inside, being able to be in a lot of mainstream media stuff to the point of not really wanting to do it and refusing 90% of it now.
[01:47:59.929 --> 01:48:01.590]  More than that, hard news.
[01:48:01.630 --> 01:48:05.931]  They're worried about a hard news audience who's at a higher level of awakening.
[01:48:05.971 --> 01:48:07.192]  So it's different propaganda.
[01:48:07.552 --> 01:48:09.013]  This is aimed at slugs.
[01:48:09.473 --> 01:48:15.615]  They think the slugs are going to want to be in the Illuminati now and are going to think this is really sexy and cool.
[01:48:16.355 --> 01:48:18.516]  And you're right, sometimes stuff slips through.
[01:48:18.776 --> 01:48:23.719]  But here it is, premiering tonight, Secret Hollywood Societies and Unsolved Mysteries.
[01:48:24.419 --> 01:48:24.700]  Go ahead.
[01:48:25.760 --> 01:48:31.023]  Yeah, and that's part of the reason why these pop stars are doing this, because they're teaching the people to appeal to it.
[01:48:31.403 --> 01:48:38.287]  Most of the mentally enslaved population, instead of seeing the Illuminati as bad, they're appealing, the power is very appealing.
[01:48:38.327 --> 01:48:39.667]  They want that wealth, they want that access.
[01:48:39.687 --> 01:48:40.708]  Well, that's one of the most successful
[01:48:40.708 --> 01:49:01.274]  People come on our lines now, it's been in the news that you tell young girls, I'm with the Illuminati, do bad things, have sex with me, I'll let you in, and it's just con artists, including pedophiles, over-aged, you know, guys with girls that are like 15, 16, and they just fall right in line because, you know, for everybody from Madonna down to Keshet, everybody else, you know, this is how you get the power.
[01:49:01.834 --> 01:49:04.455]  But really, you just get enslaved and end up being a crack whore.
[01:49:05.387 --> 01:49:07.608]  Yeah, people think that celebrity is a good thing.
[01:49:07.628 --> 01:49:08.468]  People appeal.
[01:49:08.648 --> 01:49:10.068]  They want to be that celebrity.
[01:49:10.088 --> 01:49:12.529]  That's why they idolize these really false idols.
[01:49:12.569 --> 01:49:14.950]  But the celebrities can't tell you that fame is a curse.
[01:49:15.290 --> 01:49:18.590]  They're some of the most empty, shallow, fearful people.
[01:49:18.991 --> 01:49:19.691]  Paranoid.
[01:49:20.491 --> 01:49:25.312]  Most people can't even understand what goes along with being somebody like a celebrity like these people we see on the TV.
[01:49:25.892 --> 01:49:27.673]  And it's a curse.
[01:49:28.453 --> 01:49:44.762]  And it's such a curse that the celebrities themselves can't even tell the audience to stay away and that's part of the system is to keep sucking more and more people in to make it seem like that's the ultimate goal in life is to go to these red carpet events and just look pretty and have paparazzi chasing you around and that's what
[01:49:45.362 --> 01:49:55.746]  These zombie, Generation Z, these Generation Zombies... And the problem is 99.99% of people will never even be on the edge of celebrity, so they don't know how hollow it is.
[01:49:56.186 --> 01:50:04.509]  I have gained quite a bit of quote celebrity, and have absolutely hated every minute of it, except for being able to do good with it, as kind of an anti-celebrity.
[01:50:04.889 --> 01:50:07.250]  You, I know, have now been able to traffic in that.
[01:50:07.790 --> 01:50:13.372]  Has it not demysticized it for you, Mark Dice, now that you've had a chance to be known?
[01:50:15.106 --> 01:50:16.628]  Yeah, it's pretty interesting.
[01:50:16.648 --> 01:50:18.390]  I mean, there's a lot of downside that goes with it.
[01:50:18.410 --> 01:50:25.137]  Much of the audience has no idea the kind of baggage that comes along with being a public figure, especially being a public figure in this arena.
[01:50:25.838 --> 01:50:29.061]  And it's, you know, the more popular I get, almost the more regretful it is.
[01:50:29.141 --> 01:50:32.445]  But you have to do this to reach the people.
[01:50:32.485 --> 01:50:37.090]  This is what I was made to do, is to infiltrate this system, to culture jam their mainstream
[01:50:37.170 --> 01:50:39.812]  Sure, that's what we're all meant to do, exactly, is fight this.
[01:50:39.832 --> 01:50:45.476]  My point is, for those that feel inadequate, because they sit there and watch TV all day, it's literally a weapons system.
[01:50:45.796 --> 01:50:55.223]  You're all adequate, you're all made in the image of the Creator, you're all amazing, and you're meant to fight these evil creatures, not feel bad because you're not up on a stage
[01:50:55.703 --> 01:51:02.735]  With Miley Cyrus and her big, gross, white tongue dripping with plaque and bacteria and drugs and diseases.
[01:51:03.036 --> 01:51:05.139]  Mark Dice, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[01:51:05.380 --> 01:51:06.401]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[01:51:06.441 --> 01:51:08.124]  Great job out there with Zombie on the Street.

[01:51:10.458 --> 01:51:12.219]  Are you someone who forges your own trail?

[01:51:16.202 --> 01:51:19.064]  If so, RF Bunker has a franchise opportunity for you.

[01:51:49.428 --> 01:51:50.168]  This capitalism?
[01:51:50.228 --> 01:51:56.353]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:51:56.393 --> 01:52:00.036]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[01:52:00.096 --> 01:52:01.017]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.

[01:52:15.511 --> 01:52:22.740]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[01:52:22.900 --> 01:52:26.064]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[01:52:26.204 --> 01:52:28.006]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[01:52:28.226 --> 01:52:32.811]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[01:52:32.891 --> 01:52:35.653]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[01:52:35.813 --> 01:52:41.599]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[01:52:41.759 --> 01:52:45.243]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[01:52:45.443 --> 01:52:50.488]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine.

[01:53:10.123 --> 01:53:13.607]  For over five years, you've been hearing about the Berkey guy.
[01:53:13.927 --> 01:53:15.749]  So you may know a few things about him.
[01:53:16.029 --> 01:53:22.295]  For example, you are well aware of the superior quality and effectiveness of Berkey water filters and accessories.

[01:53:28.321 --> 01:53:28.802]  It's true!

[01:54:20.250 --> 01:54:22.291]  Folks, this is breaking right now.
[01:54:22.391 --> 01:54:24.151]  This is breaking right now.
[01:54:25.132 --> 01:54:28.192]  It's going up on InfoWars.com from Reuters.
[01:54:28.813 --> 01:54:35.355]  Ladies and gentlemen, Reuters reporting a 7.3 magnitude earthquake right off Fukushima.
[01:54:36.435 --> 01:54:37.355]  That's the headline.
[01:54:37.655 --> 01:54:39.856]  We'll put it on screen for everybody right now.
[01:54:40.536 --> 01:54:41.137]  Japan hit
[01:54:43.223 --> 01:54:43.443]  By 7.3.
[01:54:43.763 --> 01:54:48.347]  We actually have the article in there on the computer, too, that has an update.
[01:54:48.367 --> 01:54:50.328]  Let's punch it up from the computer, please.
[01:54:50.888 --> 01:54:54.631]  Japan hit by 7.3 magnitude earthquake off Fukushima.
[01:54:56.252 --> 01:55:00.035]  The prefecture coast, that's the state of Fukushima.
[01:55:01.420 --> 01:55:03.441]  Tsunami advisory issued.
[01:55:03.461 --> 01:55:05.743]  Tsunami advisory issued.
[01:55:06.123 --> 01:55:13.047]  And now it's been upgraded in the last few seconds by Reuters to a 7.6 magnitude earthquake.
[01:55:15.589 --> 01:55:16.369]  A 7.62 magnitude.
[01:55:16.389 --> 01:55:20.292]  How big was the one that destroyed Fukushima to begin with?
[01:55:22.031 --> 01:55:22.811]  A solid eight.
[01:55:23.291 --> 01:55:26.392]  But if you remember at first, it was like a six and then a seven and then an eight.
[01:55:27.032 --> 01:55:27.752]  I can't believe it.
[01:55:28.172 --> 01:55:30.373]  Talk about bad luck or God not liking us.
[01:55:31.033 --> 01:55:33.393]  Why did they build it right on the fault line?
[01:55:33.793 --> 01:55:35.154]  Right on the tsunami zone?
[01:55:36.654 --> 01:55:39.975]  Man, I tell you, pray for the folks out there in Japan.
[01:55:41.035 --> 01:55:44.456]  And all I know is I'm going to be taking my iodine and my seaweed, folks.
[01:55:44.836 --> 01:55:46.196]  I mean, this is getting out of control.
[01:55:49.420 --> 01:55:51.521]  And it freaks me out, you know my gallows humor.
[01:55:52.241 --> 01:55:56.063]  I mean, this is just getting too biblical, what's going on.
[01:55:56.123 --> 01:56:06.767]  Now it is hit, and of course the answer by all these people will be, the Japanese should be thankful for all the radiation, as George Monbiot said, and also Ann Coulter.
[01:56:08.048 --> 01:56:14.491]  So, if you want to go vacation, you can vacation in the reactor and die like the emergency workers that heroically tried to stop it.
[01:56:14.831 --> 01:56:17.572]  And Fukushima's in worse shape now than it was a couple years ago.
[01:56:19.753 --> 01:56:21.534]  My head is just spinning right now.
[01:56:21.835 --> 01:56:25.098]  We're continuing to get the latest news.
[01:56:25.559 --> 01:56:30.344]  There's also massive fraud coming out as the states warn against Obamacare fraud.
[01:56:31.905 --> 01:56:33.707]  Senators are now losing their doctors.
[01:56:34.288 --> 01:56:36.810]  School districts hit with six million in new cost.
[01:56:37.351 --> 01:56:39.573]  Ten Senate Dems demand delay.
[01:56:39.974 --> 01:56:41.055]  Poll most Americans
[01:56:42.634 --> 01:56:43.555]  Support the delay.
[01:56:43.575 --> 01:56:44.416]  They're not going to delay.
[01:56:44.436 --> 01:56:46.478]  They're not going to delay your premiums going up.
[01:56:47.018 --> 01:56:47.739]  Proposed law.
[01:56:47.759 --> 01:56:49.500]  If you like your health plan, you can keep it.
[01:56:50.361 --> 01:56:50.541]  Act.
[01:56:51.082 --> 01:56:52.083]  Yeah, that'd be a good law.
[01:56:52.143 --> 01:56:54.585]  But see, you can't now, because the other one lets them jack it up.
[01:56:55.306 --> 01:56:55.826]  Comedian.
[01:56:55.886 --> 01:56:56.227]  Senator.
[01:56:56.267 --> 01:56:57.948]  Website improving every day.
[01:56:57.968 --> 01:57:00.470]  Obama says it's outperforming.
[01:57:01.191 --> 01:57:02.913]  Disaster set in motion before 2012.
[01:57:03.513 --> 01:57:06.216]  It's meant to destroy the economy.
[01:57:07.824 --> 01:57:12.846]  We've got SWAT teams raiding investigative journalists' homes, seizing confidential files on government corruption.
[01:57:12.866 --> 01:57:17.187]  A woman's trip search tossed in jail for overdue traffic ticket.
[01:57:17.647 --> 01:57:22.069]  They now do proctology exams routinely in Texas without even probable cause.
[01:57:24.110 --> 01:57:30.795]  This is just some of the insanity up on DrudgeReport.com and InfoWars.com.
[01:57:30.875 --> 01:57:34.678]  I'm going to go to your phone calls here in just a moment.
[01:57:35.199 --> 01:57:36.360]  I appreciate everyone holding.
[01:57:36.380 --> 01:57:38.421]  In fact, let's jam one in right now before we go to break here.
[01:57:39.162 --> 01:57:40.363]  Let's talk to Eric in Canada.
[01:57:40.383 --> 01:57:41.003]  Thanks for holding.
[01:57:41.384 --> 01:57:42.585]  We'll come back and talk to Sam.
[01:57:42.625 --> 01:57:43.185]  Go ahead, Eric.
[01:57:43.545 --> 01:57:44.266]  What's on your mind?
[01:57:45.107 --> 01:57:46.688]  How's your health?
[01:57:46.728 --> 01:57:47.749]  My health's pretty good, brother.
[01:57:47.789 --> 01:57:48.469]  Better than it used to be.
[01:57:48.489 --> 01:57:51.151]  Okay, we've got to keep you alive for a long time.
[01:57:51.672 --> 01:57:53.173]  I just wanted to let you know about
[01:57:54.285 --> 01:58:01.409]  Uh, uh, recently in Alberta they've been hyping up, uh, sovereign citizens and, uh, they call them the label of free men on the land.
[01:58:02.190 --> 01:58:06.612]  And, uh, the RCMP established a, uh, division called INSTEDD last year.
[01:58:07.633 --> 01:58:10.755]  And, uh, they keep, uh, like, demonizing them in the media.
[01:58:11.315 --> 01:58:16.418]  They're actually... Oh, I know, anybody that wants to be left alone doesn't trust the evil government and is afraid.
[01:58:16.458 --> 01:58:17.078]  They're bad.
[01:58:17.098 --> 01:58:19.500]  I mean, we have evil governments worldwide.
[01:58:19.520 --> 01:58:20.400]  The globalists run them.
[01:58:20.801 --> 01:58:22.842]  Of course you should be heading to the hills if you can.
[01:58:24.488 --> 01:58:26.089]  Yeah, so these people are pretty moral people.
[01:58:26.129 --> 01:58:27.250]  They're not racist at all.
[01:58:27.490 --> 01:58:28.131]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:58:28.171 --> 01:58:30.172]  It's being moral that is bad, sir.
[01:58:30.913 --> 01:58:34.555]  Listen, they say being a Christian, period, will get you arrested in the military now.
[01:58:35.556 --> 01:58:37.698]  I mean, you realize the magnitude of these people, brother.
[01:58:38.954 --> 01:58:46.763]  Yeah, so, uh, I was playing Grand Theft Auto last night, uh, the new one, and it had a Canadian, like, terrorist working with the civil, uh... Tell you what, stay there.
[01:58:46.823 --> 01:58:49.065]  Yeah, all globalist media demonizes us.
[01:58:49.686 --> 01:58:50.507]  This is military.
[01:58:51.027 --> 01:58:51.948]  These are talking points.
[01:58:51.968 --> 01:58:59.717]  Just like Hollywood was against the Nazis in World War II or whatever, now they've been giving the orders, demonize the founding fathers, Christians, children, everything.
[01:59:00.836 --> 01:59:05.938]  Alex Jones here, and I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show, My Patriot Supply.
[01:59:06.298 --> 01:59:14.780]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[01:59:15.200 --> 01:59:22.503]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow Patriots.
[01:59:23.023 --> 01:59:30.405]  My Patriot Supply brings us their exclusive Patriot Pantry brand, along with many other fine preparedness products.
[01:59:30.925 --> 01:59:34.326]  I personally store and use their high-quality products.
[01:59:34.866 --> 01:59:38.506]  It tastes great, and it's easy to store for up to 25 years.
[01:59:39.067 --> 01:59:45.648]  For a limited time, you can save $50 instantly on a four-week supply of food, along with other special offers.
[01:59:46.208 --> 01:59:52.929]  Visit mypatriotsupply.com forward slash Alex today, with the New World Order making rapid advances on every front.
[01:59:53.409 --> 01:59:57.450]  It is essential to prepare with My Patriot Supply today.
[02:00:03.260 --> 02:00:05.185]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:05.666 --> 02:00:08.432]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:15.049 --> 02:00:19.251]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:19.871 --> 02:00:20.692]  You want answers?
[02:00:21.472 --> 02:00:22.413]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:23.013 --> 02:00:26.595]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:27.195 --> 02:00:31.277]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:37.020 --> 02:00:40.082]  I tell you, I don't know whether to cry or just start laughing insanely.
[02:00:40.122 --> 02:00:41.983]  I really feel sorry for the Japanese folks.
[02:00:42.003 --> 02:00:42.783]  I want to pray for them.
[02:00:43.304 --> 02:00:47.686]  But a 7.6 magnitude quake rocks Japan.
[02:00:47.746 --> 02:00:49.047]  They were saying 7.3.
[02:00:49.707 --> 02:00:51.788]  And they're set for a big tsunami to hit the coast.
[02:00:52.409 --> 02:00:53.669]  Oh man, pray for those folks.
[02:00:54.350 --> 02:00:56.031]  But this is really getting biblical.
[02:00:56.491 --> 02:01:02.474]  I mean, this is just... We were just weeks ago talking about another earthquake hitting Fukushima.
[02:01:02.574 --> 02:01:05.596]  And top scientists saying if that happens, look out.
[02:01:06.789 --> 02:01:08.590]  Because of the deteriorating situation.
[02:01:08.630 --> 02:01:10.151]  Let's go back to Eric in Canada.
[02:01:10.571 --> 02:01:12.412]  Eric, so you're playing Grand Theft Auto.
[02:01:12.772 --> 02:01:21.976]  Every video game, and I'm not a big gamer, but every video game I read about or I see in the news, it demonizes gun owners, patriots, Christians, they're always the terrorists, they're child molesters.
[02:01:22.617 --> 02:01:24.237]  It's all over every show.
[02:01:24.898 --> 02:01:33.622]  The murdering, you know, killer is the good guy, the Christian's the terrorist, and this is what's going on, not just here, but in shows in England.
[02:01:35.798 --> 02:01:37.219]  And in Europe, it's the same thing.
[02:01:37.280 --> 02:01:40.943]  So yes, this is a propaganda operation, clearly.
[02:01:40.963 --> 02:01:41.963]  Go ahead and finish up.
[02:01:42.264 --> 02:01:43.645]  What did you see on Grand Theft Auto?
[02:01:45.006 --> 02:02:04.822]  Uh, so, when I was playing it, uh, the one character is a crazy, like, Canadian, uh, like, he's basically a terrorist because he's running around doing all these crimes, but he's working with a militia called Civil Border Patrol, and they do all sorts of, like, together as a unit, they do all sorts of, uh, like, crimes and blow up things and stuff like that, and they're demonized throughout the game, too.
[02:02:05.442 --> 02:02:09.345]  It's pretty, uh, it's pretty weird that, like, that happens in that game.
[02:02:10.446 --> 02:02:12.348]  Sir, it's all my... I'd say...
[02:02:14.696 --> 02:02:27.425]  It's about 90 plus percent of every video game, every cop show, every popular book, everything out there is cartoons.
[02:02:27.445 --> 02:02:29.386]  You know, Green Lantern fights the militia.
[02:02:29.886 --> 02:02:30.967]  That's the bad guy.
[02:02:31.968 --> 02:02:33.929]  Like Captain America fought the Nazis?
[02:02:33.969 --> 02:02:35.630]  Well, Captain America fights patriots now.
[02:02:37.231 --> 02:02:38.432]  This is social engineering.
[02:02:38.452 --> 02:02:40.614]  This is an all-out culture war.
[02:02:40.634 --> 02:02:43.616]  I mean, do you understand that
[02:02:44.761 --> 02:02:50.728]  The army officially admits that they were teaching that being an evangelical Christian is a arrestable offense.
[02:02:52.472 --> 02:02:55.353]  I mean, that is Soviet Union, sir.
[02:02:56.034 --> 02:03:01.576]  I mean, the government is run by absolute red terror criminals.
[02:03:01.616 --> 02:03:02.216]  God bless you.
[02:03:02.796 --> 02:03:14.221]  And what everybody should do is, because I can't cover all this, you should tape a clip of that, or show a clip of it on your computer, put it on YouTube, say Grand Theft Auto 4 or whatever it is demonizes patriots.
[02:03:14.541 --> 02:03:17.122]  It'll get seen by a bunch of people, then we can do a report.
[02:03:17.442 --> 02:03:17.903]  You get the
[02:03:19.699 --> 02:03:22.541]  Off the state-run media, and then respond to it.
[02:03:22.561 --> 02:03:23.582]  You have to battle it.
[02:03:24.083 --> 02:03:25.804]  And then battle it, and then we'll talk about it.
[02:03:26.044 --> 02:03:39.995]  When you see the programming, you have to A, respond to it, B, boycott it, C, speak out against it publicly, not just on cyberspace, and then do something against the enemy.
[02:03:40.756 --> 02:03:43.057]  Alright, let's go to Sam in California.
[02:03:43.418 --> 02:03:44.298]  Welcome, you're on the air.
[02:03:45.479 --> 02:03:47.201]  Hey Alex, how you doing man?
[02:03:47.501 --> 02:03:48.602]  I'm good, thanks for holding, go ahead.
[02:03:49.502 --> 02:03:50.383]  Hey, God bless you.
[02:03:50.463 --> 02:03:55.868]  So, uh, I wanted to first start off by saying, wow, I can't believe Japan just got hit again.
[02:03:56.129 --> 02:03:57.530]  That's, that's ridiculous.
[02:03:57.610 --> 02:03:59.652]  This is stranger than fiction.
[02:04:00.193 --> 02:04:00.633]  Literally.
[02:04:01.474 --> 02:04:02.795]  You couldn't make this stuff up.
[02:04:04.597 --> 02:04:12.465]  So, uh, anyways, um, I was trying to make a point about what the next step would be knowing what's coming.
[02:04:13.505 --> 02:04:15.446]  Uh, for all of us Americans and patriots.
[02:04:16.287 --> 02:04:29.034]  Um, the only thing I can really see other than, you know, as far as peaceful means go, you know, people gotta really, really double down on the family and people have to stand around.
[02:04:29.074 --> 02:04:32.036]  If you're gonna have a kid, you gotta stand around to raise that kid.
[02:04:32.756 --> 02:04:34.077]  Men gotta be men again.
[02:04:34.917 --> 02:04:36.358]  Women have to be ladies again.
[02:04:36.899 --> 02:04:40.361]  You gotta reverse this whole, this, this,
[02:04:42.070 --> 02:04:44.892]  Rapid descent into the darkness, man.
[02:04:44.952 --> 02:04:45.753]  It's terrible.
[02:04:45.773 --> 02:04:47.975]  There's no coming out of that, man.
[02:04:48.115 --> 02:04:49.176]  So we gotta reverse it.
[02:04:49.816 --> 02:04:51.778]  We can't proceed going forward.
[02:04:52.959 --> 02:04:53.540]  Can't be done.
[02:04:53.660 --> 02:04:55.421]  You're like a Paul Revere, you know?

[02:08:07.891 --> 02:08:08.752]  Others don't.
[02:08:16.168 --> 02:08:25.296]  You are listening to an Infowars.com Frontline Report.
[02:08:26.137 --> 02:08:30.021]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[02:08:33.439 --> 02:08:37.021]  Army halts program that labeled Christians radical extremists.
[02:08:37.061 --> 02:08:41.262]  Said that if they gave money to evangelical groups of the Tea Party, they would be court-martialed.
[02:08:42.023 --> 02:08:43.123]  Violating their First Amendment.
[02:08:43.583 --> 02:08:46.224]  No, that's not the old Soviet Union or Nazi Germany.
[02:08:46.264 --> 02:08:47.265]  That's America.
[02:08:48.709 --> 02:08:56.813]  And we're going to a special guest who's heading up a group with Oliver Stone and others to try to draw bipartisan attention to the illegal NSA spying.
[02:08:57.333 --> 02:08:58.814]  Then your phone calls are coming up.
[02:08:59.715 --> 02:09:02.696]  But right now we need to go to Brian in Arizona.
[02:09:03.477 --> 02:09:09.560]  He's saying he's a military police and he says we've been sent footage before by military police and others so I want this footage.
[02:09:10.320 --> 02:09:13.463]  Of them in briefings openly talking about gun confiscations.
[02:09:13.803 --> 02:09:19.367]  Now that's now in the manuals that they're training to quarantine cities and towns and confiscate guns.
[02:09:19.387 --> 02:09:21.048]  We've had Navy SEALs on confirming it.
[02:09:21.509 --> 02:09:22.309]  We have the documents.
[02:09:22.349 --> 02:09:22.830]  We know that.
[02:09:22.910 --> 02:09:34.379]  But footage, not just in some Army manual, but footage could really, really hurt the folks that are trying to covertly prepare the military for basically civil war.
[02:09:34.959 --> 02:09:38.382]  Brian, obviously you've got to go back in right now.
[02:09:38.982 --> 02:09:42.485]  Tell us as much as you can and how we get this footage, but describe it for us.
[02:09:43.345 --> 02:09:45.927]  Okay, so I was in a briefing with FEMA.
[02:09:45.967 --> 02:09:47.388]  FEMA runs my old unit.
[02:09:47.448 --> 02:09:48.189]  I'm actually out now.
[02:09:48.209 --> 02:09:50.190]  I got out in September of this year.
[02:09:51.011 --> 02:09:58.156]  They were talking about suspension of the Constitution, Second and Fourth Amendment rights being taken away, and I openly ask them, are we going to take guns?
[02:09:58.196 --> 02:10:00.338]  He says no, but he says they will.
[02:10:00.378 --> 02:10:01.519]  It's clearly on the video.
[02:10:01.559 --> 02:10:01.999]  They will.
[02:10:02.039 --> 02:10:03.420]  Talking about the FEMA guys with us.
[02:10:06.209 --> 02:10:07.730]  So that's the gist of the video.
[02:10:08.291 --> 02:10:15.836]  I'm filming the floor because it kind of startled me when they said that they're going to suspend the Constitution under martial law, which is pretty scary to me.
[02:10:16.817 --> 02:10:18.298]  Well, sir, you have a right.
[02:10:18.318 --> 02:10:21.361]  When something is illegal like this, you should go public.
[02:10:21.981 --> 02:10:22.822]  Give us your full name.
[02:10:22.862 --> 02:10:28.066]  We'll try to stand behind you and everything and come on the show and talk about it.
[02:10:29.367 --> 02:10:32.029]  Do you have any establishing video before you aim to the floor?
[02:10:33.464 --> 02:10:39.566]  Now, you can see the soldiers' ACUs, and I mean, I have training regarding FEMA camps.
[02:10:39.586 --> 02:10:42.506]  I probably have three or four soldiers who would come forward and talk about that, too.
[02:10:42.546 --> 02:10:46.047]  All right, well, I'm ready to fly you all here right now, because here's the deal.
[02:10:46.147 --> 02:10:52.129]  I have all this in the civilian inmate labor camp programs, the Emergency Centers Establishment Act.
[02:10:52.229 --> 02:10:58.971]  I have footage I've shot of them training to do it and saying it's for Americans, but then saying, you know, later in the news it was for overseas.
[02:10:58.991 --> 02:11:00.111]  Of course, it's joint use.
[02:11:00.831 --> 02:11:10.857]  So, it's on record, it's just that we need the soldiers themselves and the internal videos, because for whatever reason, the whole world is a stage, each of us players upon it.
[02:11:11.217 --> 02:11:15.439]  As Shakespeare said, it's the seeing it that makes people believe it.
[02:11:15.819 --> 02:11:19.681]  Can you just upload it to YouTube, or how can you get us that video?
[02:11:19.842 --> 02:11:22.923]  If you guys can give me like an address, I can mail you like a little thumb drive.
[02:11:23.023 --> 02:11:25.004]  I'll upload it to YouTube too, but I'm a little nervous.
[02:11:25.044 --> 02:11:27.466]  I don't know if I can get in trouble for it, it's why I didn't already do it.
[02:11:27.726 --> 02:11:29.407]  Did they tell you it was a classified briefing?
[02:11:30.285 --> 02:11:35.590]  No, the FEMA agents in there, or I don't know what you want to call them, the FEMA people, they don't have security clearances.
[02:11:35.631 --> 02:11:39.014]  Well, no, I mean, I already knew that, exactly, because I've aired FEMA training videos here.
[02:11:39.034 --> 02:11:42.497]  It's got to be 20 times over the years saying the Founding Fathers are bad.
[02:11:42.517 --> 02:11:45.340]  All of that stuff, we're going to, you know, go after them.
[02:11:46.301 --> 02:11:55.030]  So, the issue is, if they're talking about just emergencies, and it's in plain view, you morally can do whatever you want.
[02:11:55.070 --> 02:11:57.993]  I mean, they may down the road try to say you can't.
[02:11:58.033 --> 02:11:59.494]  I mean, they're saying you can't be a Christian.
[02:12:00.035 --> 02:12:02.957]  But we have to call them on it to back them off.
[02:12:03.878 --> 02:12:32.586]  Uh, so, uh, I mean, I can't give you myself legal advice, because I wasn't there and don't know what they said, but no, they would say, as you know, this is a classified briefing under subsection such and such, remember you've signed agreements, you know, do not release this information, this is need to know, the folder you were given would say secret, top secret, or it would say restricted, uh, so no, I mean, I put out restricted stuff constantly, uh, and I look at it and make a determination, uh, but I don't think this was even restricted from what you're saying, so I would simply
[02:12:34.153 --> 02:12:37.374]  I would simply go to another site.
[02:12:38.855 --> 02:12:46.738]  I mean, if I was you personally, I would just upload it to a YouTube account, and I would use something like a proxy server when you go and sign up and do it.
[02:12:46.758 --> 02:12:50.479]  The problem is Google wants, that owns YouTube, wants that.
[02:12:50.880 --> 02:12:53.220]  But I mean, I'm not going to tell you what you should do.
[02:12:54.861 --> 02:12:56.202]  Because I already know what's in the manuals.
[02:12:56.222 --> 02:12:57.323]  People seem to see the video.
[02:12:57.683 --> 02:13:01.527]  I would just upload it and say who I was and be up front saying I'm a good guy.
[02:13:01.547 --> 02:13:02.267]  I have nothing to hide.
[02:13:02.688 --> 02:13:03.828]  See, because they've got us in this.
[02:13:04.249 --> 02:13:08.973]  The troops that told me they were threatening to arrest Christians last year were scared to go public.
[02:13:09.533 --> 02:13:15.718]  Well, they finally went public and now the Secretary of the Army has had to back off and say we're not going to do this anymore.
[02:13:16.279 --> 02:13:22.544]  So people need to know that FEMA is training to suspend the Constitution and confiscate firearms.
[02:13:24.591 --> 02:13:28.998]  What I can do, sir, is that we have sub YouTube accounts.
[02:13:29.058 --> 02:13:32.664]  If you know how to do it, uh, cause I could just listening to you, I trust you.
[02:13:32.684 --> 02:13:33.786]  And plus we have sub accounts.
[02:13:34.327 --> 02:13:38.474]  I can have one of my guys, Rob Dew, walk you through uploading it to our account.
[02:13:38.494 --> 02:13:38.995]  How's that sound?
[02:13:39.912 --> 02:13:40.673]  That sounds good.
[02:13:40.693 --> 02:13:51.340]  I want to get the word out there because I talk to people about it, like I've seen it, I understand it, and they're like, oh, that's crazy talk, but I want them to hear them say the Constitution will be suspended and they will take guns.
[02:13:51.600 --> 02:13:53.201]  They would be FEMA in our meeting.
[02:13:53.681 --> 02:13:57.404]  Well, as you know, it was FBI, ATF, and Auxiliary Police.
[02:13:58.525 --> 02:14:04.729]  The Army would run security in Katrina, and it was units under FEMA that did the gun grabbing.
[02:14:06.693 --> 02:14:07.153]  I know.
[02:14:07.293 --> 02:14:08.214]  I asked him about that.
[02:14:08.374 --> 02:14:09.354]  They said, we won't take him.
[02:14:09.374 --> 02:14:10.695]  I said, but what about Katrina?
[02:14:10.735 --> 02:14:12.336]  He said, well, that was a different story.
[02:14:13.376 --> 02:14:15.597]  Well, I would upload, plus they'll say it's out of context.
[02:14:15.697 --> 02:14:19.339]  I would upload a large chunk of it a couple minutes before, a few minutes after.
[02:14:19.359 --> 02:14:24.142]  And I mean, if I was you, I'd just come out and say, this is your choice.
[02:14:25.022 --> 02:14:28.664]  But I mean, we'll arrest you if you're a Christian, a mainline Christian.
[02:14:29.642 --> 02:14:31.963]  I mean, if you were a weirdo group, you shouldn't arrest people.
[02:14:32.223 --> 02:14:36.785]  I mean, this is just, we've got to stand and say, we're not bad, you're bad.
[02:14:36.805 --> 02:14:38.946]  I'm going to put you on hold, give us your name and number.
[02:14:39.247 --> 02:14:43.368]  We'll keep that secret unless you, uh, you know, don't want it to be secret.
[02:14:43.809 --> 02:14:48.951]  And then I will have Rob Due call you, uh, as soon as you're ready, we're ready to do the upload.
[02:14:49.111 --> 02:14:50.752]  Uh, so let's set that appointment, okay?
[02:14:51.581 --> 02:14:52.362]  Alright, sounds good.
[02:14:52.382 --> 02:14:52.982]  Thank you very much.
[02:15:08.493 --> 02:15:10.354]  All right, let's move on to the next issue.
[02:15:10.374 --> 02:15:26.259]  The NSA, I've got a bunch of breaking news on that, but since he's been holding with that breaking news, Ben Dornberg, you've probably heard, there is a national movement, Variety's reporting on it, Oliver Stone, John Cusack, warned against NSA surveillance, and I really like Oliver Stone.
[02:15:27.259 --> 02:15:34.443]  For his courage on JFK but also saying Obama is a snake worse than Bush because he's able to get stuff over on people.
[02:15:34.503 --> 02:15:42.267]  Cynthia McKinney says a more effective of evils and he joins us to talk about this big demonstration that's coming up.
[02:15:42.487 --> 02:15:47.610]  Ben Dornberg of rally.stopwatchingus.us.
[02:15:47.930 --> 02:15:48.691]  Thank you for coming on.
[02:15:48.711 --> 02:15:50.732]  Thank you so much for having me Alex.
[02:15:51.560 --> 02:15:52.881]  Well, you've got the floor, sir.
[02:15:53.081 --> 02:15:58.184]  Tell us about what's coming up and why your group has coalesced around the Fourth Amendment.
[02:15:58.944 --> 02:15:59.465]  Absolutely.
[02:15:59.605 --> 02:16:05.968]  So the rally against mass surveillance, which is rally.stopwatching.us, is going to be the largest rally in U.S.
[02:16:05.988 --> 02:16:09.450]  history against surveillance and for our right to privacy.
[02:16:09.590 --> 02:16:12.132]  And so it's literally hundreds of groups.
[02:16:12.172 --> 02:16:14.093]  So we've got everyone from the ACLU,
[02:16:14.753 --> 02:16:18.837]  To Reddit, to Young Americans for Liberty, and the Libertarian Party.
[02:16:19.677 --> 02:16:21.159]  So the rally is going to be in D.C.
[02:16:21.379 --> 02:16:23.220]  at noon tomorrow at Union Station.
[02:16:23.681 --> 02:16:25.823]  And we've got NSA whistleblowers speaking.
[02:16:25.943 --> 02:16:30.447]  Someone's going to be reading a new statement from Edward Snowden, who endorsed the rally.
[02:16:30.467 --> 02:16:42.217]  We're going to have Thomas Drake, Representative Justin Amash, who was the Libertarian congressman who introduced the bill that almost cut funding for the NSA's phone record program.
[02:16:42.837 --> 02:16:44.398]  And as well as a whole lot of other speakers.
[02:16:44.478 --> 02:16:53.765]  So it's, you know, if you're going to take a few hours out of your life to do anything on the NSA issue and try and get them to stop surveilling every American, this is the time to do it.
[02:16:55.026 --> 02:16:55.526]  Certainly.
[02:16:55.626 --> 02:17:00.189]  And now we learn that it's public figures all over the world for blackmailing purposes.
[02:17:00.610 --> 02:17:03.952]  We learn this is something that makes the Stasi blush.
[02:17:05.633 --> 02:17:07.455]  What do you personally think of
[02:17:08.638 --> 02:17:16.805]  From just a year ago you were a kook if you said we're being spot on, to now we know Edward Snowden has exposed, everything is basically recorded.
[02:17:17.426 --> 02:17:35.502]  Yeah, well that's why this rally is so important because, you know, before it was a thing where, yeah, some of us knew that things like this were going on, and it was, yeah, people were called kooks, and now it's at the point where now everyone knows it's going on, and if we don't take a stand now, then I think the takeaway is going to be that, oh, the American people must be okay with this.
[02:17:35.982 --> 02:17:45.530]  And, you know, we can't live in a free country if every action, every website we visit, every email we send, every phone call we make is being surveilled.
[02:17:45.590 --> 02:17:50.974]  It's not compatible with the Constitution and it's not compatible with the kind of life that we want to live.
[02:17:51.380 --> 02:17:53.721]  Well, as you said, silence is consent.
[02:17:54.181 --> 02:17:56.602]  They will set the precedent for this.
[02:17:57.022 --> 02:17:58.583]  We've got to have people prosecuted.
[02:17:58.623 --> 02:18:02.985]  You've got bipartisan folks coming out like Marco Rubio.
[02:18:03.045 --> 02:18:04.646]  Today it's up on Infowars.com.
[02:18:04.986 --> 02:18:08.768]  Dianne Feinstein last week saying, it's no big deal.
[02:18:08.828 --> 02:18:09.968]  Everything gets spied on.
[02:18:10.028 --> 02:18:10.989]  Big deal.
[02:18:11.629 --> 02:18:13.710]  It's like, oh, you know, it's big deal.
[02:18:13.730 --> 02:18:16.211]  You know, everybody knows the Nazis spy on you.
[02:18:16.651 --> 02:18:20.513]  I mean, it's so unprecedented how they're trying to hide all this in plain view.
[02:18:21.093 --> 02:18:24.714]  Yeah, well, Dianne Feinstein said that this wasn't surveillance, what they're doing.
[02:18:24.734 --> 02:18:29.336]  And Edward Snowden actually came straight out and just said, you know, what are you talking about?
[02:18:29.836 --> 02:18:35.158]  But that's so that this coalition, Stop Watching Us coalition, that's we have three things that we're asking for.
[02:18:35.798 --> 02:18:41.440]  One is to make it explicitly illegal for these sort of blanket surveillance programs.
[02:18:42.120 --> 02:18:43.981]  And then step two, what you're talking about is
[02:18:44.341 --> 02:18:48.604]  Accountability for public officials who've lied to Congress or to the American people.
[02:18:48.664 --> 02:18:59.491]  So when you look at, you know, for me personally, I think one of the most upsetting things is just watching that video of General Clapper straight lying to the Senate and with no consequences.
[02:18:59.511 --> 02:19:03.894]  You know, he didn't even lose his job, let alone, you know, it's a crime to lie to Congress.
[02:19:03.934 --> 02:19:06.416]  So I think, you know, people are outraged.
[02:19:06.476 --> 02:19:11.759]  And so it's just a question of, as you mentioned a few minutes ago, it's, you know, you can't just stay on cyberspace.
[02:19:11.779 --> 02:19:13.481]  You got to, you know, get up and
[02:19:14.721 --> 02:19:16.622]  Take to the streets and do something about it.
[02:19:16.682 --> 02:19:20.624]  So, you know, I hope everyone on the East Coast is able to make it to DC.
[02:19:20.644 --> 02:19:28.869]  You know, like I said, it's rally.stopwatching.us and this is going to be the biggest rally against surveillance in the history of the United States.
[02:19:29.557 --> 02:19:33.360]  And after you leave us, we've got one more segment where we're going to play that video clip.
[02:19:33.400 --> 02:19:36.242]  A very, very powerful little three-minute report.
[02:19:36.262 --> 02:19:40.665]  But again, tell folks the date who aren't in cyberspace by choice.
[02:19:41.025 --> 02:19:42.867]  Tell folks the date of the rally again.
[02:19:42.887 --> 02:19:43.107]  Yes.
[02:19:43.447 --> 02:19:48.251]  So it is tomorrow, Saturday at noon at Union Station in D.C.
[02:19:48.331 --> 02:19:50.652]  And for more information, rally.stopwatching.us.
[02:19:51.573 --> 02:19:52.554]  Thanks so much for having me, Alex.
[02:19:53.074 --> 02:19:53.454]  You bet.
[02:19:53.474 --> 02:19:53.855]  You bet.
[02:19:53.875 --> 02:19:54.515]  Thank you so much.
[02:19:54.535 --> 02:19:54.875]  Well, hold on.
[02:19:54.895 --> 02:19:56.777]  I want to come right back to you and have a few other questions.
[02:19:56.797 --> 02:20:01.300]  Then we're going to play that clip because I want to talk about people that aren't on the East Coast.
[02:20:01.320 --> 02:20:03.502]  If you can't go tomorrow, call the media.
[02:20:03.762 --> 02:20:04.723]  Make them be there.
[02:20:05.183 --> 02:20:06.524]  That's what's really important.
[02:20:07.184 --> 02:20:08.625]  I want to come back and ask a few more questions.
[02:20:08.666 --> 02:20:09.046]  Stay with us.

[02:21:10.177 --> 02:21:13.338]  In times of disaster, internet and mobile networks will go dark.
[02:21:13.559 --> 02:21:16.460]  A wealth of online information will be completely inaccessible.

[02:21:39.893 --> 02:21:40.913]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:21:41.013 --> 02:21:45.335]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:21:45.495 --> 02:21:51.117]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:21:51.217 --> 02:21:53.318]  Gold has outperformed paper investments yet.
[02:21:53.378 --> 02:21:54.559]  No word about IRAs.
[02:21:54.799 --> 02:21:57.360]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:57.460 --> 02:22:02.281]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:22:02.421 --> 02:22:02.662]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:02.722 --> 02:22:04.042]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:09.184 --> 02:22:14.771]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[02:22:14.931 --> 02:22:22.159]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[02:22:22.319 --> 02:22:25.503]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supplies.
[02:22:25.623 --> 02:22:27.404]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[02:22:27.644 --> 02:22:32.205]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[02:22:32.305 --> 02:22:35.066]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[02:22:35.226 --> 02:22:40.987]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[02:22:41.168 --> 02:22:44.649]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[02:22:44.849 --> 02:22:49.910]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine.
[02:22:50.090 --> 02:22:53.071]  Exclusively available at Infowarslife.com.
[02:22:53.271 --> 02:22:59.139]  Nascent Iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.
[02:22:59.259 --> 02:23:01.241]  Survival Shield Nascent Iodine.
[02:23:01.421 --> 02:23:06.228]  Secure your super high quality Nascent Iodine today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:23:06.948 --> 02:23:08.310]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:23:09.131 --> 02:23:14.134]  We travel so much, and having a fake TV, well, it gives added peace of mind.
[02:23:14.275 --> 02:23:23.781]  Burglars look for houses that appear to be easy targets, but fake TV can fool even professional burglars into thinking someone is home watching television.
[02:23:23.921 --> 02:23:35.849]  As a recent widow living alone, it gives me great peace of mind to set my fake TV near a window and know that passing motorists and pedestrians will think someone is home watching TV when I'm actually away from home.
[02:23:36.169 --> 02:23:40.531]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet just like a light on a timer.
[02:23:40.731 --> 02:23:42.292]  And they're so easy to use.
[02:23:42.532 --> 02:23:44.453]  You just plug them in and they're ready to go.
[02:23:44.733 --> 02:23:48.174]  Plus, they're so affordable that we have one upstairs and downstairs.
[02:23:48.435 --> 02:23:51.616]  Fake TV is only $29.95 with free shipping.
[02:23:51.996 --> 02:23:54.477]  Order your Fake TV by calling 877-5-FAKE-TV.
[02:23:54.497 --> 02:23:56.798]  Or go to faketv.com.
[02:23:56.858 --> 02:23:57.058]  That's 877-532-5388.
[02:23:57.098 --> 02:23:58.579]  Or faketv.com.
[02:24:05.482 --> 02:24:07.983]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[02:24:13.807 --> 02:24:17.148]  Alright, we're back live.
[02:24:17.228 --> 02:24:18.349]  Final segment with our guests.
[02:24:18.369 --> 02:24:20.890]  Your phone calls are coming up directly at the start of the next segment.
[02:24:21.491 --> 02:24:23.112]  And the other news I haven't gotten to yet.
[02:24:24.387 --> 02:24:36.954]  New news, Fox News is finally reporting an hour later on the tsunami news, or 45 minutes later, a 7.3, some are saying 7.6, that hit off the coast of Fukushima.
[02:24:38.478 --> 02:24:43.821]  Prefect or state and we'll know I guess in the next hour or so if a big tsunami hits.
[02:24:44.202 --> 02:24:48.944]  They're telling people in coastal areas to evacuate and there's really no news in the U.S.
[02:24:49.044 --> 02:24:49.845]  on this right now.
[02:24:50.605 --> 02:25:02.292]  On Fox TV they just mentioned it for five seconds out there and of course you know this all blows over directly on us and it's still melting down and worse than ever and many experts just a few weeks ago were saying if it gets another earthquake
[02:25:03.052 --> 02:25:04.372]  Of the same magnitude or near it?
[02:25:04.452 --> 02:25:07.573]  I mean, we're talking total meltdown of all those fuel rods.
[02:25:07.633 --> 02:25:10.134]  It'll make Chernobyl look like a gift.
[02:25:11.294 --> 02:25:15.715]  And Chernobyl, the UN estimates, killed a million people since 1986 from radiation.
[02:25:15.775 --> 02:25:17.616]  I mean, this is incredible.
[02:25:18.876 --> 02:25:22.737]  And at a certain point, I mean, just protecting your thyroid isn't enough, folks.
[02:25:23.657 --> 02:25:26.298]  If this continues, I'm going to have to move my kids to the Southern Hemisphere.
[02:25:26.338 --> 02:25:26.898]  I'm not kidding.
[02:25:27.824 --> 02:25:29.366]  Everybody's just bathing in radiation.
[02:25:29.426 --> 02:25:30.747]  Ann Coulter says it's good for you.
[02:25:31.388 --> 02:25:32.889]  George Monbiot says it's okay.
[02:25:32.929 --> 02:25:36.173]  Why don't they go live in Fukushima with all the dying kids and people?
[02:25:36.853 --> 02:25:37.574]  This is incredible.
[02:25:37.594 --> 02:25:45.282]  Ben Dornberg, National Chair, Restore the Fourth, Grassroots National Movement, and NSA Mass Surveillance.
[02:25:45.723 --> 02:25:48.926]  There's a video we're going to play later after he leaves us called Stop Spying on Us.
[02:25:49.587 --> 02:25:50.528]  What's the exact name of it, guys?
[02:25:52.321 --> 02:25:53.361]  Stop watching us.
[02:25:54.262 --> 02:25:55.582]  And, you know, he even corrected me.
[02:25:55.602 --> 02:25:59.664]  It was worse than what I said when I paraphrased her saying the spying's no big deal.
[02:26:00.044 --> 02:26:03.685]  She said something even more Orwellian, Dianne Feinstein, a couple days ago.
[02:26:03.725 --> 02:26:05.646]  She said, this is not surveillance.
[02:26:05.686 --> 02:26:10.248]  This is the very essence of the purest surveillance without a warrant.
[02:26:10.468 --> 02:26:11.288]  That's surveillance.
[02:26:11.348 --> 02:26:11.948]  It's just warrant.
[02:26:12.268 --> 02:26:13.429]  It's warranted surveillance.
[02:26:13.689 --> 02:26:16.570]  This is unwarranted mass dragnet.
[02:26:17.230 --> 02:26:20.391]  And it is incredible living in 1984, my friend.
[02:26:23.516 --> 02:26:33.530]  It's just, you know, we didn't think this was, you know, I didn't think people would with a straight face, you know, claim that this isn't surveillance.
[02:26:33.550 --> 02:26:34.851]  I mean, it is crazy.
[02:26:34.911 --> 02:26:39.057]  But, you know, I think what we're really seeing is with this coalition, you know,
[02:26:39.898 --> 02:26:44.540]  There are a lot of groups in the United States that are influential and just aren't going to stand for it.
[02:26:44.600 --> 02:27:04.090]  And so I think you're seeing a really interesting alliance between traditional civil liberties groups like the ACLU, internet freedom groups like the EFF, Mozilla, as well as libertarian groups like Young Americans for Liberty and Students for Liberty and Libertarian Party and, you know, I think as well as my group Restore the Fourth.
[02:27:04.630 --> 02:27:08.932]  I think what you're going to see is that there is this coalition forming of people who aren't going to stand for this.
[02:27:09.372 --> 02:27:10.233]  Well, I agree.
[02:27:10.493 --> 02:27:17.738]  And as you mentioned, there's going to be free market solutions as huge inventions get rolled out and fortunes are made countering this.
[02:27:18.119 --> 02:27:23.403]  Mozilla's light beam tool will expose who is looking over your shoulder on the web.
[02:27:24.243 --> 02:27:26.265]  So many other exciting things being developed.
[02:27:27.186 --> 02:27:34.531]  So, you know, the fact that this has been exposed and that now they have to admit this is happening, I think this is the beginning of the end.
[02:27:34.832 --> 02:27:36.313]  Plus, their spying is so great.
[02:27:36.753 --> 02:27:38.815]  The new data center keeps catching on fire.
[02:27:39.535 --> 02:27:42.136]  I mean, literally, the lines are burning up.
[02:27:42.156 --> 02:27:43.416]  They're stealing so much data.
[02:27:43.837 --> 02:27:45.397]  Yeah, well, you'll love this, Alex.
[02:27:45.437 --> 02:27:50.299]  So, the Restore the Fourth Utah chapter, actually, you know how you can do Adopt a Highway?
[02:27:50.319 --> 02:27:51.219]  Yes.
[02:27:51.259 --> 02:27:54.080]  They adopted the highway right outside the NSA's data center.
[02:27:54.800 --> 02:27:55.401]  I saw that.
[02:27:55.461 --> 02:28:01.245]  Yeah, there's a sign that says Restore the Fourth and they get to go out there in their t-shirts and hold signs while they pick up trash.
[02:28:01.305 --> 02:28:05.347]  So, yeah, I mean, you know, that's the thing is there's so many problems.
[02:28:05.367 --> 02:28:06.768]  You know, it's immoral what they're doing.
[02:28:06.808 --> 02:28:08.049]  It's unconstitutional.
[02:28:08.369 --> 02:28:11.972]  It doesn't even fit the laws that they're claiming it fits under and it also doesn't work.
[02:28:12.632 --> 02:28:21.194]  I mean, we've seen, you know, time and time again that when you try and throw this kind of, this amount of data in one place, you can't, you can't figure anything out from it.
[02:28:21.234 --> 02:28:23.794]  You're just, you know, you're just avalanched in data.
[02:28:23.874 --> 02:28:26.715]  And apparently, you know, the hardware can't even handle it.
[02:28:26.755 --> 02:28:28.495]  So, so, you know, it doesn't work.
[02:28:28.575 --> 02:28:29.156]  It's illegal.
[02:28:29.236 --> 02:28:29.776]  It's immoral.
[02:28:29.816 --> 02:28:30.956]  It's unconstitutional.
[02:28:31.136 --> 02:28:35.437]  And so I think, you know, this is going to be the first step in really
[02:28:35.857 --> 02:28:38.959]  Meanwhile, big banks are laundering drug money, not getting in trouble.
[02:28:39.399 --> 02:28:42.281]  All this corruption is hiding in plain view, and they won't do anything about that.
[02:28:42.561 --> 02:28:44.922]  They're using it to try to control markets.
[02:28:44.942 --> 02:28:46.483]  They're giving it to select corporations.
[02:28:47.003 --> 02:28:53.867]  It's the industrial sabotage and the unfair trade advantage of the Fortune 100 being able to get this data, and that's on record.
[02:28:54.187 --> 02:28:55.848]  That's the real lawsuits right there.
[02:28:56.968 --> 02:29:07.212]  We've seen that we're spying on other countries, not just their military leaders, not just their presidents, but also on their businesses, you know, for economic advantage.
[02:29:07.332 --> 02:29:17.155]  And so, you know, I think many times when these programs get defended as being against terrorism, you know, they're also being used for economic advantages and for political advantages.
[02:29:17.175 --> 02:29:17.755]  I totally agree.
[02:29:17.815 --> 02:29:23.277]  Plus, the globalists around our country aren't even giving us, the American people, the fruits of the stolen data.
[02:29:23.937 --> 02:29:27.019]  They're offshoring the stuff they steal from the Europeans to China.
[02:29:27.679 --> 02:29:28.359]  It's amazing.
[02:29:28.399 --> 02:29:35.523]  Well, we want to cover, obviously Sunday when I'm back on, what you do tomorrow, and folks can find out about the demonstration in D.C.
[02:29:35.983 --> 02:29:49.889]  Yeah, so can I just real quickly, folks can watch the live stream of the rally tomorrow on the rally website, and if people want a t-shirt or they want to chip in a few bucks, on rally.stopwatching.us there's an Indiegogo campaign that people can contribute to and get a t-shirt.
[02:29:49.949 --> 02:29:51.090]  Alright, Godspeed Ben!

[02:32:10.373 --> 02:32:18.957]  Financial experts are certain that within 12 to 36 months, the American economy will collapse, pushing most Americans into terrifying poverty, like third-world slums.
[02:32:19.157 --> 02:32:31.382]  Facing this unstoppable horror and knowing so many are unprepared, a group of military vets, engineers, survival experts, and a former FDIC bank inspector pooled their knowledge and experience to create LocustsontheHorizon.com.

[02:33:31.002 --> 02:33:42.195]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:42.255 --> 02:33:46.439]  Revolution in their hearts, the children start to march.
[02:33:49.548 --> 02:33:56.953]  A revolution against the globalist revolutionaries who wish to overthrow reality and set themselves on the throne of God.
[02:33:57.774 --> 02:34:03.818]  Blaspheming defilers who were destined to fail from the foundation of the earth.
[02:34:04.558 --> 02:34:11.443]  Their attempt to enslave humanity is only the fire to test our mettle in God's great forge.
[02:34:14.076 --> 02:34:15.576]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[02:34:16.036 --> 02:34:18.577]  We're going right back to your phone calls now.
[02:34:19.017 --> 02:34:22.317]  And then I'm going to get to other news, like 9-1-1 calls.
[02:34:22.717 --> 02:34:24.318]  Woman killed by Capitol Police.
[02:34:25.018 --> 02:34:26.778]  Thought the feds were tracking her.
[02:34:27.298 --> 02:34:29.539]  Well, yes, she ran into a checkpoint, as we now know.
[02:34:30.099 --> 02:34:30.879]  Barely bumped it.
[02:34:31.339 --> 02:34:32.519]  Ran away from them.
[02:34:34.039 --> 02:34:36.140]  And was scared in a panic, so they killed her.
[02:34:36.600 --> 02:34:37.920]  And how dare her be scared?
[02:34:39.500 --> 02:34:43.141]  I mean, if she would have got a parking ticket, they'd have taken her in for a proctology exam, as they now do.
[02:34:44.298 --> 02:34:46.499]  Land of the free, home of the brave.
[02:34:46.519 --> 02:34:47.439]  Hoorah!
[02:34:48.139 --> 02:34:51.160]  Let's go ahead now and go back to the phone calls.
[02:34:51.801 --> 02:34:53.901]  Let us talk to Ben in Missouri.
[02:34:54.661 --> 02:34:56.382]  Ben, you're on the air worldwide, sir.
[02:34:56.422 --> 02:34:56.762]  Go ahead.
[02:34:56.782 --> 02:34:59.143]  Hey Alex, how's it going today?
[02:34:59.443 --> 02:35:00.403]  Going pretty good, my friend.
[02:35:00.423 --> 02:35:10.887]  As am I, as am I. I just wanted to say I received my nascent iodine and my stack of Infowars magazines.
[02:35:11.994 --> 02:35:15.819]  First of all, I wanted to share with the listeners that the iodine, it tastes great.
[02:35:15.839 --> 02:35:16.640]  It tastes like honey.
[02:35:17.701 --> 02:35:20.144]  By the way, sir, we've not been screening calls.
[02:35:20.205 --> 02:35:20.805]  I want to be sure.
[02:35:22.047 --> 02:35:23.629]  Did we screen your call when you called in?
[02:35:25.131 --> 02:35:25.631]  No, no.
[02:35:25.651 --> 02:35:26.973]  He just asked me what the topic was.
[02:35:28.257 --> 02:35:29.218]  Here I am, on the air.
[02:35:29.418 --> 02:35:34.220]  And that's just so they can, if you want to volunteer it, I can just get an idea of what you want to talk about.
[02:35:34.240 --> 02:35:47.007]  But we go to everybody here on air, unless sometimes I say it's on a particular topic and then they've got to say, yeah, I'm a military person, or I'm a firefighter, or I'm a school teacher, or I'm a doctor, you know, giving their take on Obamacare or something.
[02:35:47.307 --> 02:35:55.291]  But nine times out of ten, it's totally unscreened, because we're getting huge listener feedback loving the iodine.
[02:35:56.031 --> 02:35:57.793]  And listen, I didn't mean to do a plug right now.
[02:35:57.813 --> 02:35:59.054]  I don't want you to be able to talk about it.
[02:35:59.874 --> 02:36:02.436]  I don't know if it's going to be positive or negative, but go ahead and give us your review.
[02:36:05.899 --> 02:36:06.359]  Go ahead, Ben.
[02:36:06.399 --> 02:36:06.960]  Give us your review.
[02:36:06.980 --> 02:36:08.020]  You want to talk about the iodine.
[02:36:09.381 --> 02:36:11.663]  Well, I just got it to taste great.
[02:36:11.703 --> 02:36:22.251]  Like I said, actually, the main thing that I wanted to talk about was one of the reoccurring themes that I always hear people call up and say, what can I do, Alex?
[02:36:22.271 --> 02:36:22.652]  What can I do?
[02:36:23.448 --> 02:36:31.473]  And this is totally, it's kind of ironic that I'm actually almost plugging another product, but I had this experience the other day.
[02:36:31.513 --> 02:36:36.495]  It's the first time that I've gotten a stack of magazines from you guys.
[02:36:36.536 --> 02:36:51.344]  It's not like I've got a bunch of extra money, but one of the things that I always go back to is the one thing that everybody can do is obviously live the best, the cleanest, and work to be a force of good in all facets of your life.
[02:36:51.800 --> 02:36:52.241]  I don't think so.
[02:37:05.151 --> 02:37:15.957]  So I went to Starbucks, because I know that that would be a good place to sit them around, and hopefully there are some open-minded people there who would be able to, you know, read the magazine, enjoy it.
[02:37:16.397 --> 02:37:20.560]  Some will take it for what it is, and maybe I'll unlock their minds.
[02:37:20.680 --> 02:37:23.141]  Some people might just throw it in the trash.
[02:37:23.681 --> 02:37:29.865]  So I go into Starbucks with five copies of the magazine, because I want to spread them out all over town, right?
[02:37:30.005 --> 02:37:33.927]  So I go into Starbucks, I set one down on a couple of the tables,
[02:37:34.502 --> 02:37:38.772]  And then I set three down on the like the community book.
[02:37:42.256 --> 02:37:46.699]  And by the way, we sell them at cost, and they're big and colorful and flashy.
[02:38:11.596 --> 02:38:22.665]  I put them down and I kind of just watched them out of the corner of my eye, went up to the counter, ordered my coffee, and I saw two people pick up the magazines almost instantly.
[02:38:22.865 --> 02:38:26.028]  And they hadn't seen me put them down there, so nobody really knew who had put them down.
[02:38:26.188 --> 02:38:30.671]  So, the first person was this older lady.
[02:38:31.032 --> 02:38:37.317]  She took it, she looked at the cover, kind of confused look on her face, looked at the back cover of Prozac the Killer Clown.
[02:38:38.135 --> 02:38:42.077]  Uh, and then she took it over the table, sat down, and started reading it.
[02:38:42.617 --> 02:38:52.442]  And, uh, I tell you what, thinking about it now, and even then, it gave me goosebumps, because, you know, maybe it was because of what I did that I unlocked this woman's mind.
[02:38:53.263 --> 02:39:02.788]  Now, then we had the polar opposite happen, and I'm hopefully, hopefully I'm going to be able to channel your, uh, NPR, uh, liberal, phony liberal voice.
[02:39:03.228 --> 02:39:03.628]  Ooooh!
[02:39:07.892 --> 02:39:08.613]  Candy!
[02:39:08.653 --> 02:39:09.274]  Candy!
[02:39:09.334 --> 02:39:09.554]  Puppy!
[02:39:09.594 --> 02:39:10.495]  Get in the car!
[02:39:10.595 --> 02:39:11.356]  Oh, here we are!
[02:39:11.476 --> 02:39:11.996]  Trendy!
[02:39:12.457 --> 02:39:18.462]  So she comes, she takes one look and, you know, in typical liberal fashion, she judges the book by its cover.
[02:39:18.522 --> 02:39:22.386]  She sees what's on the outside and she goes, Oh my God!
[02:39:22.746 --> 02:39:24.287]  Look at what somebody left here!
[02:39:24.427 --> 02:39:25.028]  Oh my God!
[02:39:25.088 --> 02:39:25.388]  What is this?
[02:39:26.677 --> 02:39:28.838]  Oh, she takes it up to the counter of the Starbucks.
[02:39:28.898 --> 02:39:29.678]  Burn this!
[02:39:29.818 --> 02:39:30.618]  Burn this!
[02:39:32.059 --> 02:39:32.099]  Oh!
[02:39:33.159 --> 02:39:33.199]  Oh!
[02:39:33.559 --> 02:39:34.960]  Arrest whoever did it!
[02:39:35.360 --> 02:39:37.360]  If troops love Jesus, arrest them!
[02:39:37.620 --> 02:39:38.501]  That's liberal!
[02:39:38.801 --> 02:39:39.721]  So what did she do?
[02:39:40.621 --> 02:39:43.022]  She gave it to the manager behind the counter.
[02:39:43.142 --> 02:39:44.202]  Oh, look what it says!
[02:39:44.282 --> 02:39:45.083]  Oh my God!
[02:39:45.223 --> 02:39:46.003]  Oh, Jesus!
[02:39:46.043 --> 02:39:47.483]  I can't believe this!
[02:39:47.944 --> 02:39:51.505]  The manager takes a look at it and pulls it in half and throws it in the trash.
[02:39:51.825 --> 02:39:52.485]  Now, luckily,
[02:39:53.894 --> 02:40:03.778]  They didn't notice the rest of the copies that I had left around the place, and the woman who was reading the magazine actually saw the entire thing happen, and she kept reading it.
[02:40:03.938 --> 02:40:10.841]  And she read that magazine from the time that I was... from the time that I ordered my coffee, to the time they made it, to the time that I walked out the door.
[02:40:10.861 --> 02:40:13.423]  And by the way, we can show people the cover of the magazine.
[02:40:13.743 --> 02:40:16.404]  It's a skull, and it says Obamacare.
[02:40:17.583 --> 02:40:20.864]  And I mean, Time Magazine and stuff has stuff way more provocative than that.
[02:40:21.204 --> 02:40:25.285]  But the fact that it criticized the Lord and Savior, that's not allowed.
[02:40:25.845 --> 02:40:30.887]  Because these are people, are authoritarians, simply amazing.
[02:40:31.427 --> 02:40:36.388]  And so, but I'll bet you money after you left, they dug that out of the trash.
[02:40:37.188 --> 02:40:39.429]  And probably got passed around and read five times more.
[02:40:41.162 --> 02:40:47.987]  I know all the people at Starbucks and I talk to them because they have the stack of the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, and the local St.
[02:40:48.027 --> 02:41:00.195]  Louis rag, the Post-Dispatch, and I always like take one of the covers and I show it to them and I kind of snicker and say, you know, this is actually, you know, not the way it is and, you know, it's this way.
[02:41:00.275 --> 02:41:05.199]  And so the people at Starbucks know who I am and what I'm all about.
[02:41:06.127 --> 02:41:29.531]  You know, usually you do kind of see a lot of people who are slightly more intelligent, I think, than your normal average American in there, so... Well, brother, if people can't afford, you know, buying magazines a dollar a piece, 64 page, big color, glossy, to give them to friends and family, and I appreciate your call, great story, that's why you can do a two-sided print at a print shop for like a cent a piece or less, isn't it?
[02:41:30.151 --> 02:41:32.372]  And you can go get a hundred copies of a flyer
[02:41:33.240 --> 02:41:41.403]  With warning, this is happening, and then some websites, and leave those out, and it's even more devastating for your bang for your buck.
[02:41:41.463 --> 02:41:50.006]  The magazine is made after you've read it to leave it at a dental office, leave it at a haircutting place, because magazines send them free there because they get read a bunch of times.
[02:41:51.267 --> 02:41:52.547]  So you go to the dental office, leave one.
[02:41:52.567 --> 02:41:53.748]  When you go to church, leave one.
[02:41:54.448 --> 02:41:55.969]  When you go to a restaurant, leave one.
[02:41:55.989 --> 02:41:58.470]  That's why we've got 10 packs up to 100 packs at cost.
[02:41:59.284 --> 02:42:01.545]  But even if you can't even afford that, it doesn't matter.
[02:42:01.585 --> 02:42:02.885]  Just speak out to people.
[02:42:03.606 --> 02:42:07.707]  Or when you're at the counter, you know, talk about, hey, all this sugar gum actually has aspartame.
[02:42:07.727 --> 02:42:09.448]  Did you know that makes you go blind?
[02:42:11.068 --> 02:42:13.249]  They count on us just getting in line.
[02:42:13.289 --> 02:42:15.870]  If we all just start speaking out, it's over.
[02:42:16.670 --> 02:42:17.130]  It's over.
[02:42:19.309 --> 02:42:19.830]  Same thing.
[02:42:20.291 --> 02:42:24.997]  Oh, you're teaching that if you're in the Tea Party, or if you give money to the Tea Party, you're going to be court-martialed.
[02:42:25.478 --> 02:42:26.720]  We're going to make a big deal out of that.
[02:42:26.780 --> 02:42:28.643]  And the Army goes, OK, we're reversing that.
[02:42:29.003 --> 02:42:29.924]  Well, that's not enough.
[02:42:29.964 --> 02:42:32.108]  There needs to be congressional investigations.
[02:42:32.388 --> 02:42:35.653]  Who said arrest people if they're an evangelical Christian?
[02:42:37.216 --> 02:42:40.038]  I mean, Cuba wasn't that bad.
[02:42:40.658 --> 02:42:44.500]  If you were a Christian in Cuba, they would kind of let you be one half.
[02:42:44.640 --> 02:42:48.943]  I mean, this is just, I mean, this is unbelievable.
[02:42:49.083 --> 02:42:50.023]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[02:42:50.824 --> 02:42:52.745]  Let's talk to Alan in Delaware.
[02:42:53.225 --> 02:42:54.166]  Alan, you're on the air.
[02:42:54.206 --> 02:42:54.546]  Welcome.
[02:42:55.748 --> 02:42:57.589]  Hey Alex, so good to be back with you.
[02:42:57.609 --> 02:43:00.952]  I just want to tell you, man, I don't have to ask you how you're doing.
[02:43:01.252 --> 02:43:04.494]  You're doing a fantastic bang-up job.
[02:43:04.754 --> 02:43:18.064]  You know, I want to just tell you as a testimonial to this nascent iodine, I turned 56 two days ago, I got this stuff two weeks ago, my REM sleep, and I'm not lying, because I don't lie.
[02:43:18.084 --> 02:43:19.765]  I don't have time for that BS.
[02:43:20.505 --> 02:43:35.709]  I was about to say, Dr. Group doesn't like to say too much about this special atomic iodine, you know, that's made with all the gas and the electricity and the secret, you know, patented way they do it.
[02:43:35.969 --> 02:43:36.850]  There's nothing else like it.
[02:43:36.870 --> 02:43:38.630]  Other iodine tastes like rocket fuel, folks.
[02:43:38.910 --> 02:43:40.931]  And it's quite frankly poisonous, the stuff you get from the store.
[02:43:41.451 --> 02:43:44.892]  This stuff that's National Academy of Sciences listed as one-of-a-kind.
[02:43:45.292 --> 02:43:46.032]  I did my research.
[02:43:46.052 --> 02:43:46.993]  I brought you the best product.
[02:43:47.013 --> 02:43:47.813]  That's why it's sold out.
[02:43:48.393 --> 02:43:49.294]  People can pre-order it.
[02:43:49.554 --> 02:43:50.836]  It'll be back in a few weeks.
[02:43:50.876 --> 02:43:52.218]  I'm not trying to get people calling about it.
[02:43:52.258 --> 02:43:53.840]  I mean, we just really promote good stuff.
[02:43:54.140 --> 02:43:59.767]  Gucciardi today goes, my God, I took two of the droppers of this, which you're not supposed to do, folks.
[02:43:59.807 --> 02:44:03.471]  Follow the indications and also talk to a physician before you take it, okay?
[02:44:04.412 --> 02:44:09.033]  He goes, man, I just went to basically, he said, the wildest dreams.
[02:44:09.694 --> 02:44:10.954]  And that's what Group says.
[02:44:11.134 --> 02:44:12.734]  I'm not going to get into all the stuff Group says.
[02:44:12.935 --> 02:44:14.695]  Look, the point is, try it.
[02:44:14.975 --> 02:44:16.235]  We haven't gotten any complaints.
[02:44:16.696 --> 02:44:23.398]  The only complaint is if you take a lot of it like I am, you'll start detoxing, stuff starts coming out of your skin, starts coming out other places.
[02:44:23.958 --> 02:44:29.359]  And then, you know, if I take a lot of it, sometimes it can give me a little bit of a stomachache because it's detoxing.
[02:44:29.959 --> 02:44:31.400]  And Dr. Group warned that would happen.
[02:44:31.900 --> 02:44:36.622]  But as bad as I treat myself, and I still look like a toad, but people can really see the difference.
[02:44:37.102 --> 02:44:38.523]  I mean, it's amazing.
[02:44:38.763 --> 02:44:48.767]  But that's why the elite puts the stuff on the same periodic table, the borine, the chlorine, the fluoride in there, because it literally blocks all your key glands.
[02:44:49.127 --> 02:44:51.268]  That's why we call it survival shield.
[02:44:52.108 --> 02:44:57.412]  Because it doesn't just detox you, it blocks all this other crud because it's electrical.
[02:44:57.712 --> 02:45:00.154]  And it goes around grabbing all that stuff.
[02:45:00.374 --> 02:45:01.054]  But I'm ranting.
[02:45:01.094 --> 02:45:01.975]  Tell me what it's doing to you.
[02:45:03.029 --> 02:45:07.292]  Well Alex, what it's done at 56 years old, my sight has gotten clearer.
[02:45:07.752 --> 02:45:09.653]  I'm just stating a fact here.
[02:45:10.073 --> 02:45:15.457]  No joke, no BS, no aspartame, diet coke, no crap for the last two and a half months.
[02:45:15.737 --> 02:45:17.078]  I've dropped 30 pounds.
[02:45:17.158 --> 02:45:19.800]  As an ex-bodybuilder, I'm starting to define.
[02:45:20.060 --> 02:45:23.162]  But let's get back to what we were talking about earlier with Fukushima.
[02:45:23.842 --> 02:45:27.663]  I've been looking at this for the last two days, brother, and I will tell you something.
[02:45:27.703 --> 02:45:33.906]  It's so weird that I get on the phone with you and half an hour ago they report a 7.4 magnitude.
[02:45:34.246 --> 02:45:49.751]  What do you think about GE in China with the EMP systems and being on the front lines of the earth, the ring of fire, and wanting to take out Japan as a staunch American ally?
[02:45:50.540 --> 02:45:52.541]  Well, sir, God bless you and I appreciate your call.
[02:45:53.181 --> 02:46:00.624]  The last time they had Fukushima, the national media attacked me and said that I said it was a tsunami bomb.
[02:46:01.565 --> 02:46:02.805]  That is not what I said.
[02:46:02.945 --> 02:46:09.068]  I said it was in the London Telegraph and in the Australian, it's called the Australian newspaper,
[02:46:10.760 --> 02:46:20.412]  About 10 years ago, they declassified a plan to have tsunami bombs to attack the Eastern Soviet Union or Japan after World War II.
[02:46:21.153 --> 02:46:26.419]  And they actually tested a tsunami bomb off the coast of some island chain in the South Pacific.
[02:46:26.479 --> 02:46:26.940]  I forget.
[02:46:26.960 --> 02:46:27.420]  The point is...
[02:46:27.961 --> 02:46:31.842]  Is that anybody can type in Pentagon develops tsunami bombs.
[02:46:32.262 --> 02:46:33.443]  You'll get London Telegraph.
[02:46:34.123 --> 02:46:36.703]  That was the latest article that I was covering then.
[02:46:37.044 --> 02:46:40.885]  And then the White House-run media groups came out and said that I said it was that.
[02:46:40.965 --> 02:46:46.126]  I'm not saying, I am not saying, Rachel Maddow, not that you even hurt me, but you're just such liars.
[02:46:46.146 --> 02:46:46.966]  You'll take it out of context.
[02:46:47.286 --> 02:46:49.227]  I am not saying the new tsunami today.
[02:46:50.067 --> 02:46:54.730]  And the new 7.6 or 7.3, it varies, earthquake was man-made.
[02:46:55.231 --> 02:46:58.613]  I'm saying these technologies exist and it's suspicious.
[02:46:58.673 --> 02:46:59.794]  And actually, I'll search it.
[02:47:00.414 --> 02:47:01.195]  I'll just go over here.
[02:47:01.535 --> 02:47:07.339]  If you type in man-made tsunami, our Pentagon plans man-made tsunami for Japan.
[02:47:07.899 --> 02:47:09.140]  That was after World War II.
[02:47:09.180 --> 02:47:09.780]  You can pull it up.
[02:47:09.800 --> 02:47:10.120]  Let me see.
[02:47:11.141 --> 02:47:12.841]  Or while I go to a collar, I'll pull that up.
[02:47:13.561 --> 02:47:15.322]  You know, just like I said, there are weather weapons.
[02:47:15.762 --> 02:47:19.623]  Probably wasn't a weather weapon that hit Oklahoma City, but they do have weather weapons.
[02:47:19.643 --> 02:47:21.463]  That's mainline news.
[02:47:22.103 --> 02:47:23.743]  And then they said that I said it was a weather weapon.
[02:47:24.103 --> 02:47:30.165]  So it's just, but, but, but yeah, it is a little suspicious that it's the same spot over and over again, but it is Japan.
[02:47:30.185 --> 02:47:32.425]  They build their houses out of paper and balsa wood for a reason.
[02:47:32.765 --> 02:47:34.205]  I mean, they built it on a fault line.
[02:47:34.545 --> 02:47:36.826]  One of the biggest, most, I think they say it's,
[02:47:37.666 --> 02:47:43.149]  Arguably the most active volcano area in the world, in Japan, where they built this sucker.
[02:47:43.169 --> 02:47:43.890]  But I'm going to find it.
[02:47:45.130 --> 02:47:47.732]  Let's go ahead and go to Big Ben.
[02:47:47.772 --> 02:47:48.612]  Big Ben, you're on the air.
[02:47:48.632 --> 02:47:52.774]  Am I on?
[02:47:52.854 --> 02:47:53.915]  Yeah, you are.
[02:47:54.015 --> 02:47:54.775]  Yep, you sure are.
[02:47:57.077 --> 02:48:02.720]  First of all, I just want to say, you saved my life.
[02:48:03.300 --> 02:48:04.061]  You really did.
[02:48:06.081 --> 02:48:10.864]  And I am really grateful that I found your show.
[02:48:11.624 --> 02:48:14.366]  You realize more people need to see your damn show?
[02:48:14.486 --> 02:48:17.507]  I'm still trying to get my family to see your show.
[02:48:17.908 --> 02:48:27.053]  Sir, it's on record that they put fluoride in the water that's highly electrical to block the pineal and the thyroid and to attack the pancreas.
[02:48:27.233 --> 02:48:27.693]  On record.
[02:48:28.113 --> 02:48:29.214]  They say they do it.
[02:48:29.494 --> 02:48:32.356]  White House science czar says they do it to hurt you.
[02:48:34.193 --> 02:48:35.776]  I mean, of course everybody's zombies.
[02:48:36.297 --> 02:48:38.000]  Of course your family can't listen to you.
[02:48:38.160 --> 02:48:40.184]  They're 60 years under chemical warfare.
[02:48:41.106 --> 02:48:42.869]  They're blessed they can even tie their shoelaces.
[02:48:44.175 --> 02:48:45.216]  I'm not being mean.
[02:48:45.676 --> 02:48:47.697]  I mean, look, the globalists wanted to take us.
[02:48:47.717 --> 02:48:48.817]  They first had to poison us.
[02:48:49.057 --> 02:48:50.078]  By the way, I found the article.
[02:48:50.378 --> 02:48:51.538]  Just type in Tsunami Bomb.
[02:48:51.718 --> 02:48:53.059]  Don't click News, because it's old.
[02:48:53.119 --> 02:48:55.200]  Click Web, and you'll get it.
[02:48:55.220 --> 02:48:57.621]  Tsunami Bomb Tested Off New Zealand Coast.
[02:48:58.041 --> 02:49:07.085]  United States and New Zealand Conducted Secret Tests of Tsunami Bombs Designed to Destroy Coastal Cities by Using Underwater Blasts to Trigger Massive Tidal Waves Using Hydrogen Boom-Booms.
[02:49:07.705 --> 02:49:11.027]  And it goes on, the tests were conducted, and then it breaks it all down.
[02:49:11.067 --> 02:49:11.607]  So there you go.
[02:49:11.647 --> 02:49:17.269]  Now they will take that out of context and say that I made it up and said that a bomb did this today.
[02:49:17.809 --> 02:49:20.791]  Because they are hitting an audience they know.
[02:49:22.199 --> 02:49:25.240]  I used to be an Obamacare supporter and the reason I was an Obamacare supporter was
[02:49:52.298 --> 02:49:54.219]  First of all, I thought it was a big joke.
[02:49:54.619 --> 02:49:57.380]  And I thought, oh, okay, everyone, this is just one big joke.
[02:49:57.520 --> 02:49:59.181]  Everyone's joking around about it.
[02:49:59.701 --> 02:50:01.282]  But then it started getting really serious.
[02:50:01.322 --> 02:50:03.683]  I'm like, wait, they're actually serious.
[02:50:04.123 --> 02:50:05.064]  Are they smoking crack?
[02:50:07.445 --> 02:50:10.986]  And then it was like, this, this is insane.
[02:50:11.006 --> 02:50:13.187]  It didn't make any sense whatsoever.
[02:50:13.207 --> 02:50:14.428]  And I
[02:50:17.492 --> 02:50:27.104]  Then started supporting it just for the sake of maybe I should just die.
[02:50:27.725 --> 02:50:31.670]  Since everyone else around me is supporting it, then obviously
[02:50:33.883 --> 02:50:34.604]  It's not for me.
[02:50:34.864 --> 02:50:36.065]  No, no, no.
[02:50:36.105 --> 02:50:37.285]  That's group psychology.
[02:50:37.305 --> 02:50:40.208]  Just because everybody else is jumping off the cliff, you don't have to.
[02:50:40.508 --> 02:50:43.110]  Go out and help others and help those that don't want to die.
[02:50:43.550 --> 02:50:45.631]  Move on from those that want to crawl in their hole.
[02:50:45.952 --> 02:50:46.932]  Feel sorry for them.
[02:50:47.252 --> 02:50:47.733]  Warn them.
[02:50:48.734 --> 02:50:49.494]  Try to move on.
[02:50:50.054 --> 02:50:51.415]  So don't ever do that.
[02:50:51.676 --> 02:50:53.377]  You're not thinking about hurting yourself, are you?
[02:50:55.286 --> 02:50:57.847]  I listen to you while I'm going to sleep, you know.
[02:50:58.167 --> 02:50:59.328]  Tell you what, stay there.
[02:50:59.368 --> 02:51:01.768]  I'm going to come back to you and figure out exactly what you're saying.
[02:51:02.189 --> 02:51:03.369]  Don't hang up, Big Ben.
[02:51:04.049 --> 02:51:09.011]  And Shawana, and Kentucky, and others, we're going to get to everybody coming up.
[02:51:09.591 --> 02:51:10.091]  Stay with us.
[02:51:11.071 --> 02:51:12.932]  Not all protein powders are created equal.

[02:52:58.128 --> 02:53:15.235]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[02:53:15.395 --> 02:53:22.618]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[02:53:22.778 --> 02:53:26.019]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[02:53:26.099 --> 02:53:27.500]  There's only two ways to avoid
[02:53:27.500 --> 02:53:27.820]  I don't know.
[02:53:50.566 --> 02:53:53.590]  Exclusively available at Infowarslife.com.
[02:53:53.730 --> 02:53:59.597]  Nascent Iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.
[02:53:59.717 --> 02:54:01.699]  Survival Shield Nascent Iodine.

[02:54:18.311 --> 02:54:20.732]  All they want to do is see us killing one another.
[02:54:20.752 --> 02:54:27.777]  I'll be hosting the Nightly News tonight, 7 o'clock central, on Friday night.
[02:54:28.357 --> 02:54:30.479]  We'll have a lot of breaking news on the tsunami.
[02:54:30.599 --> 02:54:34.381]  I'm going to go back to Big Ben here in a minute, because I sound like he said, I don't know if I should go on living.
[02:54:35.082 --> 02:54:38.584]  This is the great challenge, this is when you want to be alive, facing all this evil.
[02:54:39.125 --> 02:54:40.185]  This is what it's all about.
[02:54:40.205 --> 02:54:43.627]  Anthony Gucciardi, in the last few weeks,
[02:54:44.554 --> 02:54:46.716]  Has been talking about the record number of typhoons.
[02:54:46.976 --> 02:54:48.817]  They call them hurricanes in our side of the world.
[02:54:49.057 --> 02:54:50.479]  They're typhoons on the other side.
[02:54:51.740 --> 02:54:56.463]  And they get up to over 200 miles an hour and are much more devastating as the Pacific's obviously bigger.
[02:54:57.224 --> 02:55:04.970]  So a Pacific megastorm is a typhoon and Atlantic is a hurricane.
[02:55:05.748 --> 02:55:06.829]  They've got a huge one.
[02:55:06.869 --> 02:55:07.749]  Here's the RT story.
[02:55:07.789 --> 02:55:13.673]  Fukushima moves radioactive water as it braces for Typhoon Francisco.
[02:55:13.993 --> 02:55:21.358]  And on top of it, a 7.6 or 7.3, there's different reports, just went off off the coast about an hour and 10 minutes ago.
[02:55:21.998 --> 02:55:23.699]  And they're evacuating for that.
[02:55:25.643 --> 02:55:26.764]  I hope nothing's going to hit him.
[02:55:26.804 --> 02:55:28.526]  I guess we'll find out in the next 30 minutes or so.
[02:55:29.928 --> 02:55:32.110]  But my point is, is that what a horrible place.
[02:55:32.170 --> 02:55:36.775]  And you were saying during the break, before I drug you in here, you're saying this is either divine or it's devilish.
[02:55:36.815 --> 02:55:40.059]  And my whole point is, there's the article Tsunami Bomb Tested Off New Zealand Coast.
[02:55:40.399 --> 02:55:41.881]  All I'm saying is this stuff does exist.
[02:55:42.221 --> 02:55:46.887]  And so MSNBC has no right to attack me, even though they're deceptive, about what is admitted to be going on.
[02:55:47.347 --> 02:55:49.350]  Well, the thing is, this is such a perfect storm.
[02:55:49.410 --> 02:55:55.980]  I mean, not is it just the typhoon, this typhoon Francisco coming in and they're already bracing for it saying, yeah, the radio activity is insane.
[02:55:56.020 --> 02:55:56.821]  It's going to go in the ocean.
[02:55:56.862 --> 02:55:58.424]  It's going to go everywhere with this typhoon.
[02:55:58.925 --> 02:56:03.131]  But then the typhoon is mixing with this weird cold weather streak that's up there.
[02:56:03.331 --> 02:56:05.532]  So it's gaining mass, it's gaining power.
[02:56:05.932 --> 02:56:09.114]  That's going to come in anyway and attack Fukushima.
[02:56:09.374 --> 02:56:12.116]  But then we have this weird earthquake that continues to be upgraded.
[02:56:12.196 --> 02:56:14.657]  It was 6.8, then it was 7.3, now they're saying 7.6.
[02:56:15.337 --> 02:56:16.198]  Who knows what it actually is.
[02:56:16.558 --> 02:56:20.880]  That hits, and now they're saying a tidal wave is going to hit along Fukushima.
[02:56:21.320 --> 02:56:24.462]  So we already have the typhoon, and now we have an earthquake and a tidal wave.
[02:56:24.782 --> 02:56:25.562]  I mean, what's next?
[02:56:25.823 --> 02:56:27.784]  Is a star going to fall on Fukushima?
[02:56:27.804 --> 02:56:32.406]  I mean, this is the perfect storm of events that are converging on Fukushima right now.
[02:56:32.566 --> 02:56:33.306]  Oh, Wormwood.
[02:56:33.706 --> 02:56:34.066]  All right.
[02:56:34.086 --> 02:56:35.067]  Talking about stars falling.
[02:56:35.087 --> 02:56:35.647]  Thank you, Anthony.
[02:56:35.667 --> 02:56:37.227]  We'll get more tonight on the nightly news.
[02:56:37.247 --> 02:56:37.867]  Thank you so much.
[02:56:38.588 --> 02:56:51.591]  Folks, all I know is that that is why we have been warning people over and over again with what's happening in the northern hemisphere with the radiation levels more than double to protect your thyroid.
[02:56:51.611 --> 02:56:54.552]  That's what got me into the modified one that we sell on Infowarsstore.com.
[02:56:54.952 --> 02:57:00.974]  That's what got me into trying to find the best nascent iodine, talking to all the top scientists and doctors and folks, and then
[02:57:01.960 --> 02:57:06.525]  Rediscovering Dr. Group is right here in Texas and finding this patented iodine that's sold out.
[02:57:07.746 --> 02:57:11.370]  And it is just everybody trying to take care of themselves.
[02:57:11.390 --> 02:57:14.233]  I sell water filters because they're the water filters I use.
[02:57:14.373 --> 02:57:18.658]  I sell modafilin and nascent iodine because it's the products I use and I believe in.
[02:57:18.678 --> 02:57:22.161]  You just heard those testimonials of spontaneous people calling in.
[02:57:22.742 --> 02:57:26.263]  Maybe I should screen calls if we don't have all those testimonials, because we've got news to cover.
[02:57:26.283 --> 02:57:29.464]  It sounds ridiculous, but that's really how good all this stuff is.
[02:57:30.065 --> 02:57:31.685]  And it's not a silver bullet, though.
[02:57:31.725 --> 02:57:34.946]  It's just something to mitigate it, other than moving to the Southern Hemisphere.
[02:57:35.366 --> 02:57:37.467]  It just shows the insanity of what we're dealing with.
[02:57:37.507 --> 02:57:44.069]  So, InfoWarsStore.com to find the amount of filin that we do have in stock that has the natural nascent iodine in it.
[02:57:44.549 --> 02:57:46.030]  So, that's InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:57:46.510 --> 02:57:48.531]  And regardless, the radiation levels are up with reactors.
[02:57:49.051 --> 02:57:49.591]  We're good to go.
[02:58:05.422 --> 02:58:09.603]  You're not saying you're going to hurt yourself and feel like there's nothing, you know, in life left, are you?
[02:58:09.863 --> 02:58:14.084]  Because you have a job to wake up others and protect innocents.
[02:58:14.825 --> 02:58:18.826]  Okay, so you're not saying you're feeling like ending it all, are you?
[02:58:19.966 --> 02:58:20.766]  No, no, no.
[02:58:21.187 --> 02:58:23.587]  For the longest time I was feeling really depressed.
[02:58:23.687 --> 02:58:25.148]  I really just wanted to die.
[02:58:25.268 --> 02:58:27.068]  And then I came across your show.
[02:58:27.148 --> 02:58:33.130]  I found out that, hey, there are other people that, you know, see the truth and, you know,
[02:58:34.529 --> 02:58:44.972]  I had trouble sleeping at night, and now I turn on your show, you know, and go to sleep tonight, you know, listening to you, and I'm able to, you know, go to sleep.
[02:58:45.152 --> 02:58:50.033]  Good, good, because our show's about getting a fight back in you and taking action against the globalists.
[02:58:50.053 --> 02:58:54.394]  I'll do the Nightly News tonight, 7, back live on the radio, Lord willing, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:58:54.674 --> 02:58:56.994]  for the Sunday Transmission Central.
[02:58:57.174 --> 02:58:59.335]  We're coming back straight ahead with your calls.
[02:59:00.635 --> 02:59:13.766]  With over 3,000 years of historic use, Pure Silver continues to be one of nature's most reliable and effective agents against fighting viruses, mold, fungus, bacteria, pathogens and parasites.
[02:59:14.387 --> 02:59:24.696]  At Silver Lungs, we have developed a reliable and easy-to-use full production system for creating endless Pure Nano Silver solutions right from the convenience and comfort of your home.
[02:59:25.336 --> 02:59:29.579]  Your self-produced nano-silver solutions can be applied topically to the skin.
[02:59:29.979 --> 02:59:39.947]  For many who are new to silver that wish to try silver for the first time, we offer a full line of consumables and cosmetics, such as our 2-ounce nano-silver nasal sprays.
[02:59:40.307 --> 02:59:40.827]  We're good to go.
[03:00:14.946 --> 03:00:15.587]  Big Brother.
[03:00:16.247 --> 03:00:17.269]  Mainstream media.
[03:00:18.009 --> 03:00:19.111]  Government cover-ups.
[03:00:19.771 --> 03:00:20.592]  You want answers?
[03:00:21.353 --> 03:00:22.254]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:22.915 --> 03:00:26.539]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:27.099 --> 03:00:31.204]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:31.504 --> 03:00:34.247]  Well, colleges are saying don't bring brown bags either.
[03:00:34.287 --> 03:00:34.727]  That's racist.
[03:00:36.309 --> 03:00:37.750]  They know it's totally random and not true.
[03:00:37.770 --> 03:00:38.250]  They just do it.
[03:00:38.631 --> 03:00:39.731]  And don't come as a cowboy.
[03:00:39.751 --> 03:00:41.052]  That's racist against cowboys.
[03:00:41.712 --> 03:00:42.873]  No stereotypes allowed.
[03:00:42.913 --> 03:00:43.954]  I guess don't come as a soldier.
[03:00:43.974 --> 03:00:45.355]  It's all about mind control.
[03:00:45.615 --> 03:00:47.616]  They're gonna change the Washington Redskins name now.
[03:00:47.636 --> 03:00:49.037]  It looks like maybe to Bravehearts.
[03:00:49.477 --> 03:00:50.618]  Don't call the Natives brave.
[03:00:50.638 --> 03:00:51.819]  That's what it's meant to be anyways.
[03:00:51.839 --> 03:00:53.420]  It's saying they're icons of strength.
[03:00:55.049 --> 03:00:58.131]  Turn that into the big issue to set the stage for political correctness.
[03:00:58.571 --> 03:01:01.973]  You heard about teapots that look nothing like Hitler being banned by JCPenney.
[03:01:02.293 --> 03:01:03.454]  Well, I brought Hitler Dog.
[03:01:03.494 --> 03:01:04.554]  His name's actually Captain.
[03:01:05.215 --> 03:01:08.897]  And, you know, I assure you, folks, he likes everybody, no matter what color they are.
[03:01:09.517 --> 03:01:15.981]  And he can't help it that I guess he does look a little bit like Hitler, but he's got to be destroyed for racist reasons.
[03:01:16.581 --> 03:01:18.042]  Just look at this creature.
[03:01:18.882 --> 03:01:21.083]  Just, I mean, he's a little embarrassed for the camera.
[03:01:21.524 --> 03:01:22.844]  But he loves Daddy, don't you?
[03:01:22.884 --> 03:01:23.485]  Don't be shocked.
[03:01:27.376 --> 03:01:28.658]  Oh, good boy.
[03:01:28.678 --> 03:01:30.620]  This is so good.
[03:01:30.780 --> 03:01:32.642]  Look at the creature.
[03:01:32.662 --> 03:01:33.443]  You just cannot see.
[03:01:33.563 --> 03:01:35.465]  Look at those spotted pink lips.
[03:01:36.166 --> 03:01:39.090]  This is the most beautiful creature right here.
[03:01:41.786 --> 03:01:43.586]  But he's acting very distr- Oh, I know why!
[03:01:44.206 --> 03:01:47.007]  My barbecue's in the trash can over there, no wonder!
[03:01:47.027 --> 03:01:48.887]  No wonder he keeps looking over there.
[03:01:49.267 --> 03:01:50.088]  He's a little dirty today.
[03:01:50.128 --> 03:01:52.708]  I brought him on the green belt jogger with me, so he's got mud on his face.
[03:01:53.108 --> 03:01:54.168]  We bring his soccer ball.
[03:01:55.249 --> 03:02:00.770]  And, uh... Then he grabs it and bites it, and then I throw it to him, so... He smells barbecue.
[03:02:00.790 --> 03:02:02.270]  Do you need it?
[03:02:02.870 --> 03:02:05.050]  He needs his barbecue.
[03:02:05.070 --> 03:02:07.791]  Because he's racist and hateful.
[03:02:08.884 --> 03:02:10.466]  Look at that handsome.
[03:02:11.226 --> 03:02:12.207]  Alright, I'm sorry folks.
[03:02:12.247 --> 03:02:13.108]  I just love this dog.
[03:02:13.608 --> 03:02:14.789]  Here, you guys want to see him up on the table?
[03:02:14.809 --> 03:02:16.351]  He might try to jump off, but he's an athlete here.
[03:02:16.411 --> 03:02:17.952]  Show people how handsome you are.
[03:02:17.972 --> 03:02:18.312]  Here you go.
[03:02:18.713 --> 03:02:19.914]  There you go, document cam on him.
[03:02:19.934 --> 03:02:20.414]  There you go.
[03:02:20.915 --> 03:02:22.636]  He's like, oh my goodness.
[03:02:22.656 --> 03:02:23.297]  So there he goes.
[03:02:23.837 --> 03:02:25.038]  Hold on, I'll take you down.
[03:02:25.078 --> 03:02:25.579]  Come here, sweetie.
[03:02:25.619 --> 03:02:25.859]  Come here.
[03:02:26.199 --> 03:02:26.660]  No, no, no, no.
[03:02:26.680 --> 03:02:26.880]  Come here.
[03:02:26.900 --> 03:02:27.600]  I know you smell the barbecue.
[03:02:27.620 --> 03:02:27.821]  Come here.
[03:02:27.841 --> 03:02:29.562]  You're being very bad because of the barbecue.
[03:02:29.602 --> 03:02:29.802]  Come on.
[03:02:30.623 --> 03:02:31.984]  There you go.
[03:02:32.084 --> 03:02:34.226]  Alright, thank you.
[03:02:34.246 --> 03:02:35.147]  I didn't plan on doing that.
[03:02:36.721 --> 03:02:37.662]  Richard brought him in here.
[03:02:37.842 --> 03:02:42.266]  Richard loves when I bring him to work because he dotes on him all day and feeds him barbeque.
[03:02:42.947 --> 03:02:45.109]  Anyways, in fact, he's going to get in the trash over there.
[03:02:45.129 --> 03:02:46.110]  That's exactly what he's been on.
[03:02:46.130 --> 03:02:49.473]  I was wondering why he kept looking over there, like, smelling brisket.
[03:02:49.493 --> 03:02:51.855]  I smelled it earlier and it drove me crazy.
[03:02:52.916 --> 03:02:54.258]  Let's go ahead and go to a phone call.
[03:02:54.898 --> 03:02:55.499]  Shawana.
[03:02:55.519 --> 03:02:56.940]  Yeah, take Hitler dog out.
[03:02:56.960 --> 03:02:58.642]  He's racist.
[03:02:58.882 --> 03:02:59.563]  You're on the air.
[03:02:59.623 --> 03:03:00.624]  Welcome from Kentucky.
[03:03:02.825 --> 03:03:03.966]  Alex, how are you?
[03:03:04.006 --> 03:03:04.907]  Shawna, Shawna.
[03:03:04.927 --> 03:03:05.747]  Sorry, I got your name wrong.
[03:03:05.787 --> 03:03:06.988]  I was busy looking at Hitler Dog.
[03:03:07.248 --> 03:03:07.548]  I'm good.
[03:03:07.568 --> 03:03:10.871]  I'm a little bit racist right now, but go ahead.
[03:03:10.931 --> 03:03:16.134]  Hey, I'm actually listening to you on the computer and I can't wait to watch the video so I can see your sweet dog.
[03:03:16.194 --> 03:03:16.795]  I love dogs.
[03:03:16.955 --> 03:03:17.375]  Thank you.
[03:03:17.455 --> 03:03:29.083]  But, I just wanted to tell you because you've influenced my life so much and I've been watching since January and I have found something that I'm going to do and I'm going to raise some hell in Kentucky come 2014, Alex.
[03:03:29.103 --> 03:03:29.624]  Sounds racist.
[03:03:32.853 --> 03:03:35.095]  Yeah, I've officially got my website up.
[03:03:35.115 --> 03:03:36.116]  Can I get the name of it?
[03:03:36.156 --> 03:03:36.536]  Sure.
[03:03:37.617 --> 03:03:44.363]  Alright, it's Shawna4FreedomAnn.com and I am running for the 2014 US Embassy.
[03:03:46.559 --> 03:03:47.720]  Oh great, awesome.
[03:03:48.000 --> 03:04:02.551]  So I just want to let people know and also just thank you so much because what I've listened to on the show and your influence has had a lot of help in helping me reach this decision.
[03:04:03.692 --> 03:04:06.995]  So are you going to run for Mitch McConnell's seat or who are you going to run for in Kentucky?
[03:04:07.822 --> 03:04:08.743]  Oh yeah, man.
[03:04:08.963 --> 03:04:15.869]  I, you know, nobody's going to get a run up against in the Democratic for the primary because they're not going to let anybody else run against Ms.
[03:04:16.010 --> 03:04:16.430]  Allison.
[03:04:16.810 --> 03:04:25.058]  So I'm definitely, people, if you're, if you're a Democrat, I need you to switch over to Republican because in Kentucky, you got to be Republican to vote for me in the primary.
[03:04:25.218 --> 03:04:26.579]  And it's going to be Shawna Sterling.
[03:04:26.619 --> 03:04:29.102]  I'm going to be on the ballot and I'm going to kick some butt.
[03:04:29.906 --> 03:04:31.888]  And I see you have a gun there on your side.
[03:04:31.928 --> 03:04:32.388]  I like that.
[03:04:32.428 --> 03:04:34.530]  And photos of your farm animals.
[03:04:34.550 --> 03:04:35.170]  That's awesome.
[03:04:35.731 --> 03:04:36.931]  And a racist dog.
[03:04:36.992 --> 03:04:38.373]  That dog kind of looks like Hitler.
[03:04:39.554 --> 03:04:40.094]  Oh, man.
[03:04:40.114 --> 03:04:41.615]  I'll tell you.
[03:04:41.915 --> 03:04:44.858]  All right.
[03:04:44.898 --> 03:04:45.758]  Well, thank you so much.
[03:04:45.798 --> 03:04:46.359]  Very exciting.
[03:04:46.399 --> 03:04:47.019]  I'm out of time.
[03:04:47.059 --> 03:04:47.760]  Sorry to George.
[03:04:49.021 --> 03:04:50.982]  Sorry to Marcus and David.
[03:04:51.042 --> 03:04:55.026]  But I will be back, Lord willing, Sunday at 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:04:55.566 --> 03:04:57.508]  Pray for folks in Japan on a serious note.
[03:04:58.824 --> 03:05:02.267]  And more, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, Nightly News Tonight.
[03:05:02.747 --> 03:05:07.671]  I'll be hosting it with some breaking news we haven't gotten to yet, and whatever else breaks in the meantime.
[03:05:10.464 --> 03:05:16.066]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[03:05:16.206 --> 03:05:26.110]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents ready to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[03:05:26.530 --> 03:05:33.832]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow patriots.
[03:05:34.373 --> 03:05:38.194]  My Patriot Supply brings us their exclusive Patriot Pantry
