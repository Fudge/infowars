[00:00:10.572 --> 00:00:19.418]  We're here at the settlement home in Austin, Texas, where a 13-year-old girl allegedly escaped this facility, was offered a ride by some men that she did not know, who took her to an apartment complex.
[00:00:19.718 --> 00:00:32.227]  And according to KENS San Antonio, it happened right here at the Avalon Palms apartment complex, where a 13-year-old girl was abducted, brought to this apartment complex, and allegedly raped multiple times by multiple attackers.
[00:00:32.287 --> 00:00:38.511]  As many as 10 men could have been involved in the incident, many of which are said to have filmed the incident on their cell phones.
[00:00:38.951 --> 00:00:44.217]  Now after the alleged attack, the young girl was let go, was able to use one of the attacker's cell phones to phone a friend.
[00:00:44.517 --> 00:00:50.144]  That didn't work out and the young lady actually ended up at the house of another woman who let her smoke crack in her residence.
[00:00:51.345 --> 00:00:54.448]  Now at least some of the men alleged in the attack were illegal immigrants.
[00:00:54.548 --> 00:01:00.193]  I bring this up because we've seen before illegal immigrants being let off of crimes because of their unique cultural heritage.
[00:01:00.994 --> 00:01:07.159]  So with the settlement home under investigation and three suspects already in custody, hopefully we can find justice for this little girl.
