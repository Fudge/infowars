[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:05.810]  First, direct from Austin, you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:00:12.489 --> 00:00:16.652]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:17.332 --> 00:00:18.133]  You want answers?
[00:00:18.913 --> 00:00:19.814]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:20.454 --> 00:00:24.076]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:24.637 --> 00:00:28.699]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.581]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back.
[00:00:48.761 --> 00:00:49.561]  We are live.
[00:00:49.601 --> 00:00:51.762]  We are broadcasting worldwide.
[00:00:52.562 --> 00:01:08.606]  And we have a special guest, a highly decorated military veteran who's also an artist and a Second Amendment activist joining us, coming up in studio in the third hour to get the perspective of a veteran on the world today.
[00:01:08.726 --> 00:01:13.808]  Met Mario Lopez down in San Antonio at the Open Carry Rally at the Alamo.
[00:01:14.818 --> 00:01:19.819]  And he lost an arm, mostly flesh off his face, and an eye, and an IED.
[00:01:19.839 --> 00:01:21.059]  That's not all we're having him on.
[00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:30.182]  He's an amazing artist, and just his story of adversity and fighting through it is buoying to my heart, and I think it will be to yours as well.
[00:01:30.722 --> 00:01:37.783]  So that is coming up, and he will be in studio with us today in the third hour.
[00:01:38.163 --> 00:01:40.504]  But the balance of the transmission, the first two hours,
[00:01:41.184 --> 00:01:45.287]  We will be taking your phone calls, covering the news.
[00:01:45.387 --> 00:01:46.989]  Mancow said his phone died.
[00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:49.150]  The battery died when we went to break.
[00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.731]  And so he'll finish his story.
[00:01:50.771 --> 00:01:57.677]  The real reason I got him on was not the $9.5 million buy-off plan to go to a pro-Obama radio show.
[00:01:59.227 --> 00:02:08.233]  The real reason I wanted to have him on was talking to a major Hollywood star who personally knew Obama and actually lived with him for years, he was saying.
[00:02:09.514 --> 00:02:20.342]  And so that's some real intel there, and we want to get him back on to talk about that a little bit for about 5-10 minutes at the bottom of the hour to finish the rest of the story.
[00:02:20.962 --> 00:02:23.164]  Obviously, it's just an overload of news.
[00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:32.814]  We declared a semi-victory yesterday when the Seattle Police Department that put in NSA spy boxes hooked into the federal government via the Threat Fusion Centers.
[00:02:33.694 --> 00:02:42.539]  We declared a semi-victory that they had at least said, okay, we're going to turn off these devices while the City Council looks at it, because the Council never even authorized them to be turned on.
[00:02:43.179 --> 00:02:43.899]  It was a grant.
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.681]  Last year, the system's being put in right now.
[00:02:46.741 --> 00:02:50.203]  The city wanted to review it to find out what it's doing, if it's violating privacy.
[00:02:50.523 --> 00:02:52.504]  The police, of course, under Homeland, had it on.
[00:02:54.261 --> 00:02:54.962]  That's what it's all about.
[00:02:55.002 --> 00:02:58.248]  It's about the bureaucracy doing whatever it wants totally illegally.
[00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:04.961]  Just like the DEA is in all the NSA data systems spying on Americans without warrants and then using it in court.
[00:03:05.562 --> 00:03:06.844]  It's all completely illegal.
[00:03:08.072 --> 00:03:09.934]  It's all completely selectively enforced.
[00:03:10.374 --> 00:03:15.498]  It is the people that run this country that ship in the vast majority of the narcotics.
[00:03:15.518 --> 00:03:23.424]  They're the same big banks that own the military-industrial complex, that own the big insurance complex, that own the big pharma complex.
[00:03:23.825 --> 00:03:25.966]  They push the legal and the illegal drugs on you.
[00:03:26.467 --> 00:03:31.010]  And I would just advise young people, never get on any of it, including coffee.
[00:03:31.931 --> 00:03:34.273]  Because once you get addicted to something, it's not fun.
[00:03:34.353 --> 00:03:35.314]  I'm addicted to coffee.
[00:03:36.297 --> 00:03:43.304]  I've battled tobacco my whole life, haven't had any tobacco other than I think a couple cigars the last three and a half years.
[00:03:44.225 --> 00:03:47.648]  I'm always on and off pipes, cigarettes, chewing tobacco.
[00:03:48.168 --> 00:03:51.051]  If it grows on a tobacco plant, I want to put it in my body.
[00:03:53.153 --> 00:03:58.218]  But the issue is that imagine this is the modern slavery.
[00:03:58.678 --> 00:04:01.141]  They put out these chemicals, they put out these plants,
[00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:07.032]  That have always been there, that people have been using forever, that in the twenties and thirties you could buy at any drugstore.
[00:04:07.392 --> 00:04:13.016]  You could send a five-year-old in to buy a box of cocaine, or a box of opium, a bottle of opium.
[00:04:13.437 --> 00:04:19.421]  Then they make it illegal, it puts all this money into it, it creates a huge crime culture, corrupts the police.
[00:04:20.061 --> 00:04:24.164]  Well yeah, when did they get rid of prohibition?
[00:04:24.184 --> 00:04:24.204]  1930s.
[00:04:24.224 --> 00:04:25.005]  Early 1930s.
[00:04:29.454 --> 00:04:31.696]  When did they make all the other drugs illegal?
[00:04:32.136 --> 00:04:33.978]  Right then, they needed a new business.
[00:04:34.578 --> 00:04:40.403]  The only reason I'm concerned about getting rid of the drug war is that you've got such a criminal culture now.
[00:04:41.912 --> 00:04:43.633]  That the criminals will go to other things.
[00:04:44.393 --> 00:04:46.455]  We know this from countries that have decriminalized.
[00:04:47.015 --> 00:04:49.616]  It's made crime drop massively except for a few things.
[00:04:50.457 --> 00:04:51.597]  Kidnapping and stuff.
[00:04:52.278 --> 00:04:52.878]  It doesn't matter.
[00:04:53.038 --> 00:04:54.419]  Justice be done, may the heavens fall.
[00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:59.122]  Big Obamacare news, big military news, big NSA news.
[00:04:59.822 --> 00:05:04.545]  It's all coming up and I'll finish up with the fact that the police did not turn the Wi-Fi system off.
[00:05:04.605 --> 00:05:06.566]  Of course not.
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:13.381]  Alex Jones here, and I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show, My Patriot Supply.
[00:05:13.741 --> 00:05:22.224]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[00:05:22.624 --> 00:05:29.926]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow Patriots.
[00:05:30.466 --> 00:05:37.848]  My Patriot Supply brings us their exclusive Patriot Pantry brand, along with many other fine preparedness products.
[00:05:38.348 --> 00:05:41.751]  I personally store and use their high-quality products.
[00:05:42.311 --> 00:05:45.953]  It tastes great, and it's easy to store for up to 25 years.
[00:05:46.494 --> 00:05:53.098]  For a limited time, you can save $50 instantly on a four-week supply of food, along with other special offers.
[00:05:53.659 --> 00:06:00.384]  Visit mypatriotsupply.com forward slash Alex today, with the New World Order making rapid advances on every front.
[00:06:00.864 --> 00:06:04.907]  It is essential to prepare with My Patriot Supply today.
[00:06:07.495 --> 00:06:12.077]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[00:06:12.218 --> 00:06:15.199]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[00:06:15.339 --> 00:06:20.582]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[00:06:20.902 --> 00:06:22.563]  It all comes down to one thing.
[00:06:22.843 --> 00:06:24.124]  We are what we eat.
[00:06:24.464 --> 00:06:28.808]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[00:06:29.128 --> 00:06:33.131]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:35.693]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[00:06:35.913 --> 00:06:41.838]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[00:07:07.873 --> 00:07:14.096]  Strategic relocation is a systematic way to think strategically in the future about how do I safeguard.
[00:07:14.497 --> 00:07:16.878]  Renowned author and expert, Joel Skousen.
[00:07:16.978 --> 00:07:17.258]  The U.S.
[00:07:17.338 --> 00:07:21.460]  isn't building huge underground bases and bunkers because of some terrorist threat.
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.142]  They know that a massive nuclear attack is coming.
[00:07:24.522 --> 00:07:25.782]  They want that attack to come.
[00:07:26.003 --> 00:07:32.186]  Joel Skousen is renowned as one of the world's foremost experts in strategic relocation and the securing of your home.
[00:07:32.586 --> 00:07:35.047]  What I tell people is that you do have time.
[00:07:35.267 --> 00:07:40.029]  We talk about natural disasters, the health environment, we talk about pollution, the water quality.
[00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:47.653]  My personal experience about being in every one of these states, most people won't even be ready, won't be able to get out of town, because there'll be absolute panic.
[00:07:47.973 --> 00:07:50.515]  There is no preparedness without strategy.
[00:07:50.715 --> 00:07:53.378]  This Christmas, give the gift of preparedness.
[00:07:53.838 --> 00:07:58.081]  Strategic Relocation Film with Joel Skousen and Alex Jones.
[00:07:58.402 --> 00:08:02.985]  Available only at InfoWarsShop.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:08:18.587 --> 00:08:21.591]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:08:22.172 --> 00:08:26.338]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:37.665]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's already Thursday, the 14th day of November, 2013.
[00:08:39.047 --> 00:08:42.210]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:45.073]  We're going to be here live for the next three hours.
[00:08:45.694 --> 00:08:52.902]  President Obama is giving a press conference slash speech yet again.
[00:08:53.923 --> 00:08:58.344]  Selling the propaganda that is the Obama Nation care.
[00:08:59.445 --> 00:09:00.645]  The scam care.
[00:09:01.706 --> 00:09:06.547]  Now going over the latest on Obamacare here today.
[00:09:07.687 --> 00:09:11.829]  Businesses cut full-time workers to meet Obamacare mandate.
[00:09:12.309 --> 00:09:15.990]  Study finds Christian Science Monitor.
[00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:17.571]  Oh really?
[00:09:17.651 --> 00:09:18.431]  It was written
[00:09:19.676 --> 00:09:28.182]  To lower wages and incentivize part-time, because the globalists want a poor population.
[00:09:28.462 --> 00:09:36.407]  That's a set, Agenda 21, UN official policy is to make you poor and a renter.
[00:09:37.648 --> 00:09:38.369]  Let's continue.
[00:09:38.469 --> 00:09:42.331]  I know you've heard this a thousand times here, but now it's happening en masse.
[00:09:42.511 --> 00:09:47.695]  Public college cites high cost of Obamacare in canceling students' health plans.
[00:09:50.023 --> 00:09:54.752]  It goes on and on, and now Obama is out giving a speech.
[00:09:54.792 --> 00:09:59.942]  Here, let's hear some of the latest lies that he's reading off of a teleprompter.
[00:10:01.015 --> 00:10:01.055]  Oh!
[00:10:01.075 --> 00:10:01.875]  As smoothly as it should be.
[00:10:02.136 --> 00:10:03.556]  Unintentional comedy.
[00:10:03.716 --> 00:10:04.857]  Oh, it's working just fine.
[00:10:04.877 --> 00:10:05.617]  Go to one of our navigators.
[00:10:05.637 --> 00:10:07.859]  We'll enroll you in the Democratic Party and anti-gun groups.
[00:10:26.745 --> 00:10:30.348]  Doing more will require work with Congress.
[00:10:30.768 --> 00:10:35.892]  And I've said from the beginning, I'm willing to work with Democrats and Republicans to fix problems as they arise.
[00:10:36.392 --> 00:10:38.214]  This is an example of what I was talking about.
[00:10:38.854 --> 00:10:40.856]  We can always make this law work better.
[00:10:42.017 --> 00:10:50.203]  It is important to understand, though, that the old individual market was not working well.
[00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:56.041]  And it's important that we don't pretend that somehow that's a place worth going back to.
[00:10:57.201 --> 00:10:59.981]  Too often it works fine, as long as you stay healthy.
[00:11:00.822 --> 00:11:02.062]  It doesn't work well when you're sick.
[00:11:02.562 --> 00:11:04.142]  Alright, let's stop right there.
[00:11:04.162 --> 00:11:05.162]  We'll go back to it in a minute.
[00:11:05.422 --> 00:11:13.824]  Ladies and gentlemen, we had the lowest cost, on record, highest quality health care in the world 50 years ago, on record.
[00:11:14.124 --> 00:11:14.944]  That's on record.
[00:11:15.484 --> 00:11:20.305]  All the royalty of the planet, Saudi Arabian, British, Dutch, Japanese, they all came here.
[00:11:21.095 --> 00:11:23.457]  Lowest cost, highest quality.
[00:11:23.477 --> 00:11:24.078]  Let me say that again.
[00:11:24.218 --> 00:11:27.841]  Lowest cost, highest quality, quickest delivery.
[00:11:29.462 --> 00:11:33.026]  Lowest cost, highest quality, quickest delivery.
[00:11:34.147 --> 00:11:34.547]  On record!
[00:11:37.518 --> 00:11:57.900]  Government got involved with select megacorporations and big banks that got into the insurance business and wrote regulations and set things into the markets to control and monopolize the markets and to then introduce government money into the markets, Medicare, Medicaid and other systems, that now drove up the price, just like education.
[00:11:59.107 --> 00:12:13.368]  We had the highest quality education in the world on average, one of the highest college graduation rates, the highest physical IQs, the most inventions, until the 70s.
[00:12:15.478 --> 00:12:15.778]  Okay?
[00:12:16.298 --> 00:12:19.660]  America was the longest-lived, on average.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.401]  America was the biggest savers, on average.
[00:12:22.642 --> 00:12:24.182]  We were the most wealthy, on average.
[00:12:24.202 --> 00:12:29.225]  We were 4% out of 100 of the world population, and we had half the wealth.
[00:12:29.565 --> 00:12:31.506]  We've lost almost all of that now.
[00:12:32.246 --> 00:12:34.187]  Globalism is a curse.
[00:12:34.687 --> 00:12:37.749]  Globalism is insider groups robbing everyone.
[00:12:38.009 --> 00:12:42.451]  So they wreck the old system, and then give you something 10 times worse.
[00:12:42.591 --> 00:12:43.712]  It's probably 20 times worse.
[00:12:44.744 --> 00:12:50.890]  And then they're going to, as I told you, write new laws to make it even worse, and worse, and worse, and worse, and worse, and worse.
[00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:58.678]  And by then, Obama the puppet will be long gone, and you'll be under globalist, fascist death care.
[00:13:00.579 --> 00:13:05.104]  Let's go back here with this literal foreign agent.
[00:13:07.096 --> 00:13:09.738]  Here to sell the trendy TV-watching public.
[00:13:10.438 --> 00:13:11.479]  Hey, he's got a neat suit.
[00:13:11.519 --> 00:13:12.439]  He's a Harvard lawyer.
[00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:14.561]  You know, he's half-black.
[00:13:14.881 --> 00:13:16.282]  This must mean there's a difference.
[00:13:16.342 --> 00:13:16.542]  No!
[00:13:16.802 --> 00:13:26.108]  The same mega-banks, the same old evil white men are the ones running things who've got everybody black and white at the ground level fighting with each other!
[00:13:27.426 --> 00:13:32.550]  And it's the ultimate joke to them to put up Obama, and it's been a devastating victory.
[00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:34.732]  He has been incredibly successful.
[00:13:35.413 --> 00:13:39.716]  He has been the most successful tyrant of the 20th century, the 21st century.
[00:13:39.896 --> 00:13:43.759]  There were other tyrants that were very successful in the 20th.
[00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:54.808]  He is, undoubtedly, Obama, I'm giving him this title now, is the most successful tyrant, liar, con artist, fraudster, fake idea.
[00:13:55.822 --> 00:14:05.746]  Madison Avenue manufactured propaganda coup d'etat that has been around in the 13, almost 14 years that is the 21st century.
[00:14:06.026 --> 00:14:14.630]  Let's go back to the pure manifestation of an actor reading off a teleprompter selling you total betrayal.
[00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:16.690]  Here is the Con Arnest in chief.
[00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:25.114]  You know, regardless of what Congress does, ultimately I'm the President of the United States, and they expect me to do something about it.
[00:14:25.874 --> 00:14:36.461]  So, in terms of how I intend to approach it, I'm just going to keep on working as hard as I can around the priorities that the American people care about.
[00:14:37.022 --> 00:14:48.089]  And I think it's legitimate for them to expect me to have to win back some credibility on this health care law in particular, and on a whole range of these issues in general.
[00:14:50.465 --> 00:14:53.748]  And, you know, that's on me.
[00:14:54.209 --> 00:14:58.052]  I mean, we fumbled the rollout on this healthcare.
[00:14:58.092 --> 00:14:58.793]  Told you, folks.
[00:14:59.574 --> 00:15:02.036]  There are a whole bunch of things about it that are working really well.
[00:15:02.276 --> 00:15:02.917]  Oh, mm-hmm.
[00:15:03.617 --> 00:15:04.458]  Which people didn't notice.
[00:15:05.119 --> 00:15:07.140]  Like saying brain cancer is working really well.
[00:15:08.021 --> 00:15:14.423]  They weren't controversial, so making sure kids could stay on their parents' plans until they were up through the age of 25.
[00:15:14.463 --> 00:15:18.184]  But the parents get thrown off the plan, you lying sack of crap.
[00:15:18.204 --> 00:15:28.047]  There were a whole bunch of stuff that we did well over the first three years, but we always knew that these marketplaces creating a place where people can shop.
[00:15:28.067 --> 00:15:28.647]  Alright, that's enough.
[00:15:29.847 --> 00:15:37.910]  They always knew that it basically increased the price the last three years by around 50% before it even kicked in.
[00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:42.132]  It got rid of the laws blocking insurance companies from stopping competition.
[00:15:44.614 --> 00:15:47.217]  And now it's ended a bunch of competition.
[00:15:47.417 --> 00:15:51.362]  It's made 50 million people, not 35 million, go out and get insurance.
[00:15:51.402 --> 00:15:53.544]  It's going to kick another 52 million off of it.
[00:15:54.165 --> 00:16:01.674]  And it is the greatest criminal transfer of wealth I've ever seen, not even to a government, but to these big banks.
[00:16:05.552 --> 00:16:09.773]  And you have to understand, folks, we've got to get out of the system to not have things collapse.
[00:16:10.213 --> 00:16:13.454]  It's designed to collapse in a stepping fashion.
[00:16:13.474 --> 00:16:16.815]  And I told you, first Sebelius would fall on her sword when this came out.
[00:16:17.995 --> 00:16:22.636]  Then Obama would fall on his sword and say, it's my fault.
[00:16:23.056 --> 00:16:26.717]  The buck stops with me because it came out even in the Associated Press two weeks ago.
[00:16:27.037 --> 00:16:27.758]  That guy searched this.
[00:16:27.778 --> 00:16:28.798]  I want to show TV viewers.
[00:16:30.023 --> 00:16:35.349]  Insurance companies warn Obama not to scale back Obamacare was the headline.
[00:16:35.829 --> 00:16:42.496]  And they were actually in their big consortium lobbying group issuing a public statement saying, listen buddy,
[00:16:43.737 --> 00:16:50.599]  Fall on that sword, take the blame, claim it's the computer not working, because they need to blame the computer not working.
[00:16:50.979 --> 00:16:52.060]  It's working, folks.
[00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:54.561]  It's designed to kick you off your plan.
[00:16:55.081 --> 00:17:02.943]  It's designed to create a pool of people who they have your ID to then make you get insurance at double, triple, quadruple, or even above that.
[00:17:03.023 --> 00:17:04.204]  Some people are paying 700% more.
[00:17:04.244 --> 00:17:04.964]  On average, it's 200% more.
[00:17:07.705 --> 00:17:16.933]  Humana in Texas, 539% increase on families with no pre-existing conditions, doesn't cover pre-existing conditions.
[00:17:17.213 --> 00:17:23.739]  This is a wish list of the most bloodthirsty, vicious insurance companies the world has ever seen.
[00:17:23.939 --> 00:17:27.042]  The ones that took over our healthcare and screwed it over.
[00:17:27.402 --> 00:17:29.964]  And the poor average Democrat goes, man, healthcare
[00:17:30.845 --> 00:17:53.716]  He's like, half my paycheck, or I can't get health care, or this is a scam, this is screwed up, and the government's like, we got a plan, just go along with this, you're really gonna love it, and now it hits you like a freight train, and they're gonna, this is how they do it, folks, because they've learned in psych warfare that if you create a process and just stall things, people then become accepting of it.
[00:17:54.377 --> 00:17:58.539]  This is their main philosophy, their main system,
[00:17:59.918 --> 00:18:00.619]  Of doing this.
[00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:10.767]  And I'm like a football coach that's been watching these people for 20-something years and knows all their plays and moves, and the general public doesn't even know the game.
[00:18:12.068 --> 00:18:13.890]  They don't even know it's a game.
[00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:19.695]  And that's why we're here, folks, is to tell you how the scams work.
[00:18:20.015 --> 00:18:25.420]  Because, listen, once you're aware of this stuff, you would cry at how obvious it is if you're a new listener.
[00:18:26.383 --> 00:18:29.764]  I know there's a thousand flavors of media and all this disinfo out there and the rest of it.
[00:18:30.085 --> 00:18:31.745]  Folks, there's a real globalist system.
[00:18:31.925 --> 00:18:34.226]  They've carried it out in hundreds of other countries.
[00:18:34.626 --> 00:18:35.747]  We know their plan.
[00:18:37.207 --> 00:18:38.248]  We know their moves.
[00:18:39.295 --> 00:18:40.395]  We know their plays.
[00:18:40.896 --> 00:18:42.176]  We know their mindset.
[00:18:42.496 --> 00:18:43.896]  We know their criminology.
[00:18:44.157 --> 00:18:45.757]  We know their modus operandi.
[00:18:46.057 --> 00:18:47.378]  We know who their daddy is.
[00:18:47.678 --> 00:18:49.298]  We know who the great-granddaddy is.
[00:18:49.598 --> 00:18:51.859]  We know who the great-great-granddaddy is, literally.
[00:18:52.299 --> 00:18:53.299]  We know the families.
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:54.640]  We know the banks.
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:56.020]  We know the players.
[00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:57.121]  We know it all.
[00:18:57.161 --> 00:19:07.544]  See, you're an expert on football, or soap operas, or you're an expert on rock and roll, or hip-hop, or Catholic saints, or whatever it is you're into, or baseball scores.
[00:19:08.124 --> 00:19:29.241]  I'm an expert on world government combines and their public plan to set up a world government, to incrementally turn off your resources until you're fully dependent, to put soft kill, slow kill poisons in the food and water where you're so brain damaged, and I am too, that you're unable to fight back and you roll over and die.
[00:19:29.946 --> 00:19:42.423]  You're in an incremental, super-technocracy, hyper-eugenics warfare plan adopted by Hitler from the British that he planned to carry out as part of Lebensstrahl, or living space, when he took over the world.
[00:19:43.064 --> 00:19:45.488]  You are under a soft-kill, weaponized program.
[00:19:46.533 --> 00:19:50.197]  Total warfare, total siege, no holds barred.
[00:19:50.858 --> 00:19:54.902]  There it is, insurers warn of overhaul-induced sticker shock.
[00:19:55.463 --> 00:20:00.428]  That's AP, and they go and warn Obama, you better not back off on this.
[00:20:01.169 --> 00:20:04.513]  You're gonna let us tax every American offshore.
[00:20:05.454 --> 00:20:06.776]  Fall on your sword, Obama.
[00:20:07.987 --> 00:20:13.089]  Alex Jones here, and I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show, My Patriot Supply.
[00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:21.934]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[00:20:22.354 --> 00:20:29.657]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow Patriots.
[00:20:30.177 --> 00:20:37.581]  My Patriot Supply brings us their exclusive Patriot Pantry brand, along with many other fine preparedness products.
[00:20:38.081 --> 00:20:41.462]  I personally store and use their high-quality products.
[00:20:42.022 --> 00:20:45.663]  It tastes great, and it's easy to store for up to 25 years.

[00:21:07.515 --> 00:21:11.940]  Every day it becomes more clear our nation is headed towards an uncertain future.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.544]  Nothing can ensure your family's security like an Atlas Survival Shelter.
[00:21:15.565 --> 00:21:19.429]  The strongest money can buy and designed to be buried up to 42 feet deep.
[00:21:19.649 --> 00:21:22.573]  With all the comforts of home and all the protection you need.
[00:21:22.633 --> 00:21:23.494]  Bulletproof Hatches.
[00:21:23.974 --> 00:21:29.158]  I'm David Hall, founder of Diamond Gusset, where we are proud of our 100% grown and sewn American-made jeans.

[00:22:07.196 --> 00:22:09.237]  It's time for a home security quiz.
[00:22:09.597 --> 00:22:22.584]  What effective home security device is smaller than a coffee cup, fakes out burglars into thinking someone is home at your house while you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is recommended by many police departments, and sells for less than $30?
[00:22:23.644 --> 00:22:25.345]  Yes, it's fake TV.
[00:22:25.585 --> 00:22:27.746]  This year, about 1 in every 50 U.S.
[00:22:27.786 --> 00:22:33.868]  homes will have a break-in with burglars usually picking the easy target, a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[00:22:34.188 --> 00:22:42.211]  Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look like someone is home watching TV by simulating the light from a real TV.
[00:22:42.771 --> 00:22:48.256]  Fake TV could be the difference between coming home to a secure house or one that's been ransacked.
[00:22:48.497 --> 00:22:55.443]  To get your fake TV for only $29.95 with free shipping, go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.
[00:22:55.463 --> 00:22:55.723]  That's 877-532-5388.
[00:22:55.824 --> 00:22:56.804]  Or go to faketv.com.
[00:22:56.925 --> 00:22:58.686]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[00:23:07.214 --> 00:23:12.098]  There are those curious about bitcoins and those using and making money with bitcoins.
[00:23:12.578 --> 00:23:13.759]  What are bitcoins?
[00:23:14.219 --> 00:23:20.283]  A bitcoin is the first decentralized currency that can be easily transferred from person to person over the internet.
[00:23:20.683 --> 00:23:22.144]  No bank needed.
[00:23:22.525 --> 00:23:27.808]  This means lower fees and accounts can never be frozen, limited or closed.
[00:23:28.189 --> 00:23:29.990]  You are in control of your money.
[00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:31.251]  And the best part?
[00:23:31.632 --> 00:23:34.856]  You can start earning and making money with bitcoins right away.
[00:23:35.257 --> 00:23:42.687]  No computer or expertise is required to earn money with bitcoins and a growing number of merchants now accept bitcoins.
[00:23:43.108 --> 00:23:46.793]  Plus, they're easily exchanged for dollars, euros and more.
[00:23:47.153 --> 00:23:58.645]  Learn more about the easiest, cheapest, most profitable way to enter the Bitcoin market and get paid every two weeks by one of the fastest growing Bitcoin miners in the world at CloudHashing.com.
[00:23:59.145 --> 00:24:01.968]  Just like it sounds, CloudHashing.com.
[00:24:02.389 --> 00:24:04.291]  That's CloudHashing.com.
[00:24:04.711 --> 00:24:06.253]  We mine your business.
[00:24:15.967 --> 00:24:21.871]  Obama is saying that he wasn't informed that the website wouldn't work until days into the crisis.
[00:24:22.952 --> 00:24:24.573]  But they say someday it's gonna work.
[00:24:26.634 --> 00:24:32.718]  And of course the website being broken is a distraction from the rates doubling, tripling, quadrupling or more.
[00:24:34.299 --> 00:24:36.941]  And people being kicked off their plans by the tens of millions.
[00:24:37.541 --> 00:24:40.083]  Set to be 50 plus million according to McClatchy.
[00:24:41.784 --> 00:24:42.985]  All of this is unfolding.
[00:24:43.845 --> 00:24:44.846]  All of this is happening.
[00:24:45.998 --> 00:24:58.423]  And then you look at it, businesses cut full-time workers, Christian Science Monitor, Wired Magazine, public colleges cite high cost of Obamacare and cancelling student health plans.
[00:25:01.805 --> 00:25:04.426]  We've got all these reports, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:06.907 --> 00:25:11.189]  Vulnerable Dems scramble to keep distance from Obamacare.
[00:25:11.229 --> 00:25:11.909]  That's out of the hill.
[00:25:13.302 --> 00:25:15.763]  What do you mean, scrambling to get your distance from it?
[00:25:15.823 --> 00:25:16.843]  I mean, you should all be proud of it.
[00:25:17.163 --> 00:25:22.665]  The Republican rhinos, John McCain and Boehner and all of them should be very proud.
[00:25:22.705 --> 00:25:24.225]  I mean, they work for the same foreign banks.
[00:25:26.286 --> 00:25:27.546]  Republicans helped write this.
[00:25:28.467 --> 00:25:31.207]  Democrats would snicker at me and say, shut up, right-winger.
[00:25:31.768 --> 00:25:33.128]  We're getting our free health care.
[00:25:33.508 --> 00:25:35.049]  You're just mad because your time's over.
[00:25:35.329 --> 00:25:36.849]  Socialism, our time has come.
[00:25:36.869 --> 00:25:42.351]  I was like, oh yeah, I'm sure the ultra-rich really want to give you something for free because they care about you, dummy.
[00:25:44.073 --> 00:25:44.674]  Here's another one.
[00:25:45.875 --> 00:25:48.898]  Ten Senate Dems who should apologize for Obamacare.
[00:25:48.918 --> 00:25:49.779]  They shouldn't apologize.
[00:25:49.819 --> 00:25:51.261]  They should be recalled.
[00:25:51.301 --> 00:25:52.262]  They should be impeached.
[00:25:52.763 --> 00:25:57.007]  Mary Landrieu, Kay Hagan, Mark Begich.
[00:25:57.067 --> 00:25:58.089]  Oh yeah, he's a piece of work.
[00:25:58.169 --> 00:25:58.990]  You know, I know his brother.
[00:26:00.631 --> 00:26:01.372]  Michael Bennett.
[00:26:02.335 --> 00:26:10.161]  Patty Murray, Tom Harkin, Chuck Schumer, Dick Durbin, Harry Reid, Max Baucus.
[00:26:10.221 --> 00:26:10.781]  No, no, no, no.
[00:26:11.742 --> 00:26:18.727]  Their people will double down even more support because they love... Losers love being gamed.
[00:26:19.428 --> 00:26:21.770]  Losers love being treated like trash.
[00:26:23.254 --> 00:26:25.015]  They don't like being treated good.
[00:26:25.035 --> 00:26:26.657]  They don't like being given a fair shake.
[00:26:27.297 --> 00:26:29.739]  They don't like being treated lovingly and honorably.
[00:26:29.999 --> 00:26:31.401]  They want to be abused.
[00:26:31.721 --> 00:26:32.902]  They don't want to be free.
[00:26:33.402 --> 00:26:40.828]  They want to be slovenly and domesticated and imagine that they're part of a power structure by supporting it.
[00:26:41.088 --> 00:26:47.654]  They are the ultimate useful idiots, the ultimate chumps, schmucks, fools, marks,
[00:26:48.991 --> 00:26:50.971]  Just, just absolutely pathetic.
[00:26:51.591 --> 00:26:57.433]  And all of you mainline Republicans that keep supporting this as well, you are helping destroy this country as well.
[00:26:57.773 --> 00:27:03.754]  Good job being naive, denying how criminal the system is, ignoring what the founders said.
[00:27:04.054 --> 00:27:07.614]  You're going to lose everything because you think you're part of the establishment.
[00:27:10.195 --> 00:27:12.055]  White House is trying to salvage Obamacare.
[00:27:12.095 --> 00:27:13.676]  Democrats are in distress.
[00:27:13.696 --> 00:27:14.256]  Well, it doesn't matter.
[00:27:14.516 --> 00:27:15.156]  They'll just put in
[00:27:16.087 --> 00:27:22.249]  Chris Christie's, they'll just put in that anti-gun, open border promoting piece of trash that the Republican leadership promotes.
[00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:24.870]  Might as well have Obama for a third term.
[00:27:24.890 --> 00:27:26.511]  At least we all know he's a liar.
[00:27:26.531 --> 00:27:31.753]  It'll take a few years to figure out that self-propelled creature, that self-propelled blob.
[00:27:33.013 --> 00:27:33.413]  Christie.
[00:27:34.394 --> 00:27:34.774]  Christie's.
[00:27:36.587 --> 00:27:40.489]  Oh look, Nancy Pelosi says Obama to propose health fix.
[00:27:40.529 --> 00:27:41.889]  He's giving the speech right now.
[00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:44.391]  He's going to fix it.
[00:27:44.431 --> 00:27:51.754]  You notice he said in his speech over and over again, he said, over and over again, he said, it stops with me.
[00:27:51.914 --> 00:27:52.674]  I take the blame.
[00:27:52.974 --> 00:27:58.477]  Because he's been told, listen, we'll prop you up, but we're going to politically destroy you for now.
[00:27:58.517 --> 00:27:59.477]  We'll rebuild you later.
[00:28:00.158 --> 00:28:05.300]  You can be just like Bill Clinton and get 100 million bucks of money, saying it's for Haitian kids and keep all of it.
[00:28:06.149 --> 00:28:09.370]  Or, you know, your $5 million trips with private jets.
[00:28:09.910 --> 00:28:12.691]  But let me explain how this works.
[00:28:13.231 --> 00:28:15.332]  You say it's your fault.
[00:28:15.732 --> 00:28:16.292]  Period.
[00:28:18.133 --> 00:28:19.554]  And you don't get rid of it.
[00:28:19.574 --> 00:28:20.794]  That's what the Republican leadership's like.
[00:28:21.494 --> 00:28:23.255]  Looks like we can't change Obamacare.
[00:28:23.275 --> 00:28:24.215]  You notice you're hearing that.
[00:28:24.515 --> 00:28:25.496]  People are like, why not?
[00:28:26.056 --> 00:28:27.456]  Why aren't there bigger hearings?
[00:28:27.516 --> 00:28:28.737]  Why aren't people getting in trouble?
[00:28:28.997 --> 00:28:29.897]  Where's the impeachment?
[00:28:30.277 --> 00:28:32.738]  Because they're all part of the same club.
[00:28:32.758 --> 00:28:35.459]  And they want to just blame Obozo.
[00:28:42.614 --> 00:28:46.297]  It goes on and on, ladies and gentlemen, the Obamacare fairy tale.
[00:28:46.938 --> 00:28:48.639]  But people like fairy tales.
[00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:51.562]  You're not supposed to tell little kids.
[00:28:52.022 --> 00:28:54.244]  I've had people tell me that I shouldn't tell my kids.
[00:28:54.945 --> 00:28:56.866]  I've been walking by an open-air Santa Claus.
[00:28:58.908 --> 00:29:04.212]  It's happened several times, and the whole, whole, whole come over, kids, and my kids go, Santa isn't real!
[00:29:04.232 --> 00:29:05.874]  When they were like three years old.
[00:29:05.894 --> 00:29:07.815]  It happened with my son, Rex.
[00:29:08.908 --> 00:29:11.829]  And people are like, you shouldn't have told him that!
[00:29:12.169 --> 00:29:15.191]  I'm just like, what am I, lying to see some guy in a red suit comes down the chimney?
[00:29:15.211 --> 00:29:23.875]  You know, they've had cases of kids that climb up on the roof by a ladder and go down the chimney and die, really thinking they're going to go down the chimney.
[00:29:24.075 --> 00:29:26.576]  Sometimes when there's a fire going in it, they've had cases of that.
[00:29:27.336 --> 00:29:28.537]  And you know, it's the same thing.
[00:29:28.617 --> 00:29:33.139]  I mean, look, listen, big government is meant to abuse you.
[00:29:34.432 --> 00:29:38.914]  Big government is meant by predatory groups to destroy you.
[00:29:39.674 --> 00:29:43.176]  And historically, it delivers nothing but poverty and patheticness.
[00:29:43.996 --> 00:29:48.338]  But all of you out there think that you succeed in life by the government getting bigger.
[00:29:48.698 --> 00:29:51.019]  I'm talking to government people, government minions.
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:54.681]  You're going to find out, just like North Korea, that it leads to hell.
[00:29:54.701 --> 00:29:56.542]  We'll be right back with intel on Obama.
[00:29:57.062 --> 00:29:57.962]  We're on the march.
[00:29:58.443 --> 00:30:00.043]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:00.984 --> 00:30:03.665]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:07.665 --> 00:30:13.253]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[00:30:13.473 --> 00:30:20.702]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[00:30:20.863 --> 00:30:24.047]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[00:30:24.187 --> 00:30:25.988]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[00:30:26.228 --> 00:30:30.812]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[00:30:30.892 --> 00:30:33.634]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[00:30:33.814 --> 00:30:39.598]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[00:30:39.758 --> 00:30:43.240]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:48.504]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine.
[00:30:48.684 --> 00:30:51.646]  Exclusively available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:30:51.906 --> 00:30:57.770]  Nascent Iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.
[00:30:57.891 --> 00:30:59.892]  Survival Shield Nascent Iodine.

[00:31:08.502 --> 00:31:13.604]  Alex Jones here, and I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show, My Patriot Supply.
[00:31:13.964 --> 00:31:22.427]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[00:31:22.847 --> 00:31:30.170]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow Patriots.
[00:31:30.670 --> 00:31:38.073]  My Patriot Supply brings us their exclusive Patriot Pantry brand, along with many other fine preparedness products.
[00:31:38.573 --> 00:31:41.974]  I personally store and use their high-quality products.
[00:31:42.535 --> 00:31:46.176]  It tastes great, and it's easy to store for up to 25 years.

[00:32:07.677 --> 00:32:10.758]  Alex Jones here with a very important announcement for truth seekers.
[00:32:11.158 --> 00:32:16.859]  We've carried a lot of amazing films and books over the years on the online video bookstore at Infowars.com.
[00:32:17.099 --> 00:32:23.481]  And out of all the titles we've carried, one stands out because it is just so chillingly convincing.
[00:32:23.681 --> 00:32:29.082]  And that's Dreams from My Real Father by Joel Gilbert, available at Infowars.com.
[00:32:29.362 --> 00:32:33.003]  This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen.
[00:32:33.203 --> 00:32:36.767]  If you want to know who Obama's real daddy is, this is the film for you.
[00:32:37.007 --> 00:32:41.391]  Don't forget, your purchase supports our broadcast and our growing media network.
[00:32:41.611 --> 00:32:43.934]  You'll also find it at infowarshop.com.
[00:32:44.114 --> 00:32:47.657]  None Dare Call a Conspiracy by Gary Allen, the book that woke me up.
[00:32:47.958 --> 00:32:52.242]  We're also carrying Behind the Green Mask, UN Agenda 21, by Rosa Corey.
[00:32:52.402 --> 00:32:55.045]  This book is coffin nails to the globalist takeover.
[00:32:55.345 --> 00:33:01.849]  The Greater Good, the most professional and up-to-date film I've ever seen exposing the scourge that is vaccines.
[00:33:02.170 --> 00:33:06.412]  These titles and a lot more are all available at InfoWarshot.com
[00:33:18.943 --> 00:33:25.195]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:40.245 --> 00:33:50.691]  Well, Obama has come out and pushed a whole other bucket of lies in a 30-minute speech in supposed press conference to the state-run media lapdogs.
[00:33:51.632 --> 00:33:52.812]  We're going to be breaking that down.
[00:33:52.953 --> 00:33:57.475]  Also, huge developments on the NSA front on Infowars.com.
[00:33:57.495 --> 00:34:01.838]  The police illegally turned on a homeland security system that grabs everybody's data.
[00:34:01.878 --> 00:34:03.239]  It's really going in nationwide.
[00:34:04.079 --> 00:34:11.022]  It is illegal, and we sourced in articles three days ago on Monday, three and a half days ago, how it was illegal.
[00:34:11.582 --> 00:34:19.165]  And so the next day the police announced, because of the city council freaking out in Seattle, that they were going to be ordering that turned off.
[00:34:19.205 --> 00:34:20.386]  It wasn't supposed to be turned on.
[00:34:20.406 --> 00:34:22.267]  And the police said, okay, we've turned it off.
[00:34:22.647 --> 00:34:24.788]  Well, the news has gone out and checked it.
[00:34:25.228 --> 00:34:26.929]  It has not been turned off.
[00:34:27.549 --> 00:34:35.950]  So, again, just a wall of government deception, and they all lie now, basically, and deceive at the mid and high levels.
[00:34:36.937 --> 00:34:52.412]  There's some good people in government, but the captainship, the commandership, the masters and commanders of the ship of state and major corporations lie as a matter of course militarily against us.
[00:34:52.432 --> 00:34:53.513]  That's a military tactic.
[00:34:53.533 --> 00:35:00.820]  We're going to be breaking that down, getting into huge amnesty news, huge news on so many fronts, but I wanted
[00:35:02.259 --> 00:35:16.133]  To get Eric Mankell-Muller, syndicated radio host, Fox host, a hit show on History Channel with his brother, Mark Muller, God, Guns and Automobiles, has other big TV shows in development.
[00:35:16.988 --> 00:35:18.149]  You know, we had him on yesterday.
[00:35:18.169 --> 00:35:29.596]  I noticed on Infowars.com and on the YouTube video that went up this morning, a minority of commenters were like, this guy didn't get offered nine and a half million dollars for a three-year contract for another radio show.
[00:35:29.616 --> 00:35:32.619]  That's not even that much for a three-year contract, folks, for those that don't know.
[00:35:33.399 --> 00:35:35.821]  And, you know, they're the media.
[00:35:35.901 --> 00:35:38.202]  Obama's not trying to buy people off.
[00:35:38.262 --> 00:35:41.464]  He didn't get an offer to go not bash the political system.
[00:35:41.645 --> 00:35:43.186]  Folks, I've gotten those offers.
[00:35:43.826 --> 00:35:47.212]  It's all over the news they're buying off the media through corporate conduits.
[00:35:47.813 --> 00:35:55.745]  And Mancow has made that type of money, I happen to know, he didn't like to brag, in a year in the past when talk radio wasn't collapsing.
[00:35:56.533 --> 00:36:00.557]  You know, back in years like 1998, years like that during the tech boom.
[00:36:00.917 --> 00:36:02.859]  I know what went on in radio back then, folks.
[00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:13.029]  I know all about it because I've been in it for 18 years, and I work with a small network that doesn't censor me, so I'm paid basically nothing by the GCN radio network.
[00:36:13.069 --> 00:36:15.332]  I want to point this out here, give you some inside baseball.
[00:36:15.752 --> 00:36:20.317]  That's why I have my own advertisement, my own product, that's how I funded this whole media operation.
[00:36:21.365 --> 00:36:22.908]  Nobody else does it the way I do it.
[00:36:23.068 --> 00:36:28.216]  I invented this to be able to get the word out by trial and error, but that's a side issue.
[00:36:28.556 --> 00:36:31.801]  I want to point out that it took a lot for him to come on air and talk about that yesterday.
[00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:35.170]  And that he had a lot of courage.
[00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:36.211]  That's why we got him on.
[00:36:36.231 --> 00:36:39.371]  Because he told me about it and I said, do you have the will to tell that on air?
[00:36:39.691 --> 00:36:40.812]  And he did tell that on air.
[00:36:40.832 --> 00:36:45.192]  And then you've got fools out there that don't know that Rush Limbaugh makes $45 million a year.
[00:36:45.713 --> 00:36:48.533]  That Glenn Beck profits and keeps over $100 million a year.
[00:36:49.493 --> 00:36:51.854]  That people like Michael Savage make incredible amounts of money.
[00:36:52.034 --> 00:36:52.854]  They just don't know.
[00:36:53.414 --> 00:36:57.415]  So instead of saying, wow, what a hero, for saying no to all that money,
[00:36:59.195 --> 00:37:00.920]  People say, oh, Mankow's making that up.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.370]  Well, I'll tell you what he's not making up, because this will all go on record right now.
[00:37:04.410 --> 00:37:07.298]  And I know he's telling the truth, because I've had those exact same offers.
[00:37:08.373 --> 00:37:09.294]  Harry Lennox!
[00:37:09.514 --> 00:37:10.755]  And that's why I got him back on the show.
[00:37:10.795 --> 00:37:12.316]  He's got to go, so it's a brief interview.
[00:37:12.716 --> 00:37:13.577]  mancow.com.
[00:37:13.597 --> 00:37:15.178]  You can follow him on Twitter.
[00:37:15.198 --> 00:37:18.481]  We'll put that up on screen for TV viewers, and I'll give it out to radio listeners.
[00:37:18.601 --> 00:37:21.643]  I'm a fan of Harry Lennox just when I've seen him in movies and stuff.
[00:37:21.663 --> 00:37:22.424]  He's a very good actor.
[00:37:23.245 --> 00:37:31.111]  And it turns out he's basically the same age as Obama, and had been friends with Obama, and basically lived with Obama, is how he put it.
[00:37:31.711 --> 00:37:34.073]  Might as well have lived with him, was the words he said to Mancow.
[00:37:34.453 --> 00:37:37.075]  He came on Mancow's show, but he got a chance to talk to him off-air.
[00:37:37.936 --> 00:37:42.658]  And, of course, he's now the hit actor on Blacklist.
[00:37:43.638 --> 00:37:51.701]  But he joins us to break down this inside intel on what he said behind the scenes about Obama.
[00:37:52.201 --> 00:37:55.382]  So, Mankal, thank you so much for coming on with us today.
[00:37:55.822 --> 00:38:01.004]  And repeat what you said on your radio show to me about Harry Lennox.
[00:38:01.024 --> 00:38:04.245]  We'll put Harry Lennox up on screen for folks that may not recognize the name.
[00:38:04.745 --> 00:38:05.085]  Go ahead.
[00:38:05.285 --> 00:38:10.706]  Alex, Alex, look, I do want to say MSNBC and all of these people are dying.
[00:38:10.986 --> 00:38:13.827]  Your model is a brilliant model for the future.
[00:38:15.327 --> 00:38:17.667]  Someday I want to come on and tell you the truth about Glenn Beck.
[00:38:17.767 --> 00:38:19.588]  I actually know the truth that nobody else knows.
[00:38:20.608 --> 00:38:29.430]  It is somewhat heartbreaking when you reveal these things, and of course you're dealing with morons that don't know, and they go, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:38:29.490 --> 00:38:31.770]  They want to believe the Matrix.
[00:38:32.694 --> 00:38:33.395]  And I understand it.
[00:38:33.415 --> 00:38:34.936]  They still want to believe the open change.
[00:38:34.956 --> 00:38:36.197]  They want to believe Obamacare.
[00:38:37.318 --> 00:38:43.703]  Look, I sold my condo and a politician today said in Chicago I just couldn't handle the taxes, the hassle.
[00:38:44.384 --> 00:38:47.066]  It's such a hassle to live in Obama's town of Chicago.
[00:38:47.086 --> 00:38:51.350]  Yeah, they're doubling the property taxes even though property value is down in Chicagoland.
[00:38:52.008 --> 00:38:52.688]  Yeah.
[00:38:52.848 --> 00:39:07.511]  But somebody said to me today, a politician, Jack Franks, you can look up who he is, I think he's one of the good ones, but he said to me, he goes, May I count, thank God you sold your condo, because now every house and condo that sells, 5% of every sale in America has to go to Obamacare.
[00:39:08.251 --> 00:39:09.211]  And I said, oh, that's a joke.
[00:39:09.231 --> 00:39:10.071]  He goes, no, no, it's true.
[00:39:10.271 --> 00:39:11.092]  Is that true, Alex?
[00:39:11.252 --> 00:39:12.352]  No, no, that is in the bill.
[00:39:12.372 --> 00:39:13.932]  In fact, I actually have an article about it right here.
[00:39:13.952 --> 00:39:14.952]  I'm glad you mentioned that.
[00:39:14.992 --> 00:39:15.272]  Go ahead.
[00:39:15.432 --> 00:39:16.473]  But can you believe that?
[00:39:16.513 --> 00:39:18.273]  And I want to say something else to the people.
[00:39:19.031 --> 00:39:24.714]  Look, I would put Alex on, and I don't give a hairy rat's ass anymore that the asses are masses.
[00:39:25.094 --> 00:39:27.975]  The masses are asses, and look, they voted for Obama twice, so.
[00:39:27.995 --> 00:39:30.917]  You know, I don't care what people think of me, I just don't care.
[00:39:31.137 --> 00:39:37.220]  But, you know, Alex, I made fun of you, we laughed at you, we had a good laugh at your expense.
[00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:39.641]  I thought you were insane.
[00:39:40.861 --> 00:39:42.422]  Drones in American skies?
[00:39:42.682 --> 00:39:42.982]  Never.
[00:39:44.583 --> 00:39:45.984]  Light posts that would listen to us?
[00:39:46.144 --> 00:39:46.424]  Never.
[00:39:47.222 --> 00:39:51.545]  The white boxes that are all over in England that are listening and gathering data.
[00:39:52.606 --> 00:39:53.306]  Ridiculous.
[00:39:54.027 --> 00:39:55.248]  Glimpse in the sky.
[00:39:55.268 --> 00:39:58.670]  I really thought you were a jackass.
[00:39:59.531 --> 00:40:02.093]  And boy, brother, you were the canary in the coal mine.
[00:40:04.414 --> 00:40:05.595]  So, there you go.
[00:40:06.075 --> 00:40:10.198]  It's funny how none of us, when you're right, nobody ever says it, do they?
[00:40:10.639 --> 00:40:14.862]  It's all knee-slapping hilarious when you're saying some of these things, but
[00:40:15.908 --> 00:40:16.648]  My God, man.
[00:40:16.668 --> 00:40:17.669]  I wish you were wrong.
[00:40:17.889 --> 00:40:18.449]  I really do.
[00:40:18.749 --> 00:40:20.169]  Believe me, I wish that too, brother.
[00:40:20.209 --> 00:40:22.390]  Every day I've got... And I do too.
[00:40:22.410 --> 00:40:23.110]  You know what, Alex?
[00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:24.011]  I really do.
[00:40:24.051 --> 00:40:24.811]  I wish I was wrong.
[00:40:24.871 --> 00:40:25.771]  I wish I didn't see it.
[00:40:26.271 --> 00:40:27.112]  Ignorance is bliss.
[00:40:27.172 --> 00:40:28.852]  I really wish I was hope and change.
[00:40:28.932 --> 00:40:33.173]  And isn't it great that Acorn's making millions to bamboozle people?
[00:40:33.193 --> 00:40:34.594]  I wish I was one of these fools.
[00:40:35.454 --> 00:40:45.438]  I often wonder, seriously, instead of toiling and worrying about my children, if I wouldn't just be better with my fat, diabetic foot being cut off by Obamacare with my Obama phone and everything taken care of.
[00:40:46.099 --> 00:40:47.439]  Actor Harry Lennox came in.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.341]  This is earth-shattering, earth-shaking.
[00:40:52.515 --> 00:40:53.936]  And I want to tell you, I get discouraged.
[00:40:54.357 --> 00:40:55.197]  I don't have to work.
[00:40:55.477 --> 00:40:56.658]  I sometimes want to walk away.
[00:40:56.678 --> 00:40:58.960]  I met a man named Jay Pharoah.
[00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:00.922]  Very cutting-edge comedian from SNL.
[00:41:01.402 --> 00:41:03.364]  Brilliant, beautiful human being.
[00:41:03.924 --> 00:41:05.726]  It renews me.
[00:41:07.307 --> 00:41:08.008]  You get cynical.
[00:41:08.048 --> 00:41:09.869]  You meet these jag-offs, these jerks.
[00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:12.571]  Harry Lennox comes in at a low point.
[00:41:13.412 --> 00:41:14.453]  I was ready to pull the plug.
[00:41:15.737 --> 00:41:20.838]  This guy is the star of the blacklist, the number one hottest new show on TV with James Spader.
[00:41:21.218 --> 00:41:25.759]  He was, many will remember, he was the general in Superman.
[00:41:26.779 --> 00:41:32.380]  He's a top, maybe the top African-American Shakespearean actor.
[00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:34.460]  He's got a version of Henry V coming out.
[00:41:35.801 --> 00:41:38.881]  So he's leaving my studio and he sees a cutout we have of Obama.
[00:41:39.541 --> 00:41:41.442]  And he says, well he's a rat bastard.
[00:41:43.082 --> 00:41:43.722]  And I said, what?
[00:41:44.474 --> 00:41:46.955]  He goes, oh, because I'm black, I have to like Obama.
[00:41:47.895 --> 00:41:48.496]  And we're laughing.
[00:41:48.536 --> 00:41:51.917]  I mean, he's, he's, the guy's a wonderful human being.
[00:41:51.957 --> 00:41:52.697]  He starts laughing.
[00:41:53.658 --> 00:41:54.598]  And we're kind of kidding a little.
[00:41:55.658 --> 00:41:59.100]  And he says, Mancow, do I remind you of him?
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:01.461]  And I said, well, I don't want to say anything.
[00:42:01.481 --> 00:42:03.421]  He goes, oh, yeah, because all black people are the same.
[00:42:04.142 --> 00:42:05.162]  And he's laughing some more.
[00:42:06.042 --> 00:42:09.784]  He goes, Mancow, Barack Obama is me.
[00:42:09.804 --> 00:42:12.345]  He goes, you've seen me on TV.
[00:42:13.311 --> 00:42:14.352]  You've seen me in movies.
[00:42:14.912 --> 00:42:15.653]  He is me.
[00:42:15.673 --> 00:42:18.355]  And I said, what are you talking about?
[00:42:19.856 --> 00:42:20.716]  What are you saying?
[00:42:21.197 --> 00:42:22.878]  He goes, do I remind you of Obama?
[00:42:23.979 --> 00:42:25.180]  And I said, well yeah, you do.
[00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:33.165]  He goes, he mimicked me, he followed me for years, and they wanted me to train him and teach him how to act.
[00:42:33.766 --> 00:42:35.027]  This is Harry Lennox's words.
[00:42:35.763 --> 00:42:36.864]  I've got some of my crew here.
[00:42:37.144 --> 00:42:38.224]  Please correct me if I'm wrong.
[00:42:38.545 --> 00:42:39.085]  And what was the word?
[00:42:39.125 --> 00:42:40.546]  Like an educated ship.
[00:42:40.986 --> 00:42:42.727]  Southside educated African-American.
[00:42:42.747 --> 00:42:44.228]  Put your crew member as a witness on.
[00:42:44.248 --> 00:42:45.288]  This is national news.
[00:42:45.709 --> 00:42:46.189]  Put him on.
[00:42:47.149 --> 00:42:47.430]  Okay.
[00:42:48.030 --> 00:42:48.910]  Which crew member is it?
[00:42:49.451 --> 00:42:50.531]  It's a guy named Nathan.
[00:42:50.551 --> 00:42:51.232]  He's one of my producers.
[00:42:51.272 --> 00:42:51.672]  Here you go.
[00:42:53.353 --> 00:42:53.733]  Oh, sir.
[00:42:54.453 --> 00:42:55.654]  Nathan, this was during a break.
[00:42:55.694 --> 00:42:57.155]  Tell us what Lennox said.
[00:42:57.901 --> 00:42:59.903]  Yes, exactly what Mankow said.
[00:42:59.963 --> 00:43:03.586]  He called Barack Obama, he said, I got to rap faster.
[00:43:03.686 --> 00:43:05.328]  He goes, he nimmed me for years.
[00:43:06.208 --> 00:43:13.455]  I trained him to be a South Side educated African American black man from Chicago.
[00:43:14.436 --> 00:43:16.137]  Exactly what Mankow said.
[00:43:17.198 --> 00:43:19.180]  And he was taught to act like Barack Obama.
[00:43:21.402 --> 00:43:23.423]  Our Harry Lennox was taught by Barack Obama.
[00:43:23.483 --> 00:43:28.664]  And it's on record, I looked this up when Mancow told me this yesterday, that they are friends and knew each other for years.
[00:43:29.644 --> 00:43:38.006]  That's right, he says he's known him since 1992, spent many hours with him at his house, talking for hours.
[00:43:38.746 --> 00:43:43.087]  He says the only person that knows him better than him would be Michelle Obama.
[00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:50.061]  Unbelievable, and he went on to say that he's a rat bastard and amazing.
[00:43:50.581 --> 00:43:54.162]  Tell folks, thanks for talking to us, please put Mankal back on.
[00:43:54.422 --> 00:43:54.722]  Thank you.
[00:43:56.122 --> 00:43:59.083]  Show Mankal, this is at the end of the interview, he's leaving during a break.
[00:43:59.143 --> 00:44:02.823]  Alex, Alex, I hate you bringing this guy into it because now he's going to get audited.
[00:44:03.343 --> 00:44:08.124]  You and I get attacked every year, I get audited illegally every year, they've never gotten one dime.
[00:44:08.804 --> 00:44:12.365]  And also, you have to understand something, Harry Lennox has to work in Hollywood.
[00:44:13.178 --> 00:44:16.580]  And I really love the guy and I hope I don't get him in trouble by revealing this.
[00:44:17.161 --> 00:44:20.383]  But he did say, I know him, probably only Michelle knows him better than I do.
[00:44:20.723 --> 00:44:22.144]  And he said he's very stupid.
[00:44:22.684 --> 00:44:24.065]  He's been taught to act like this.
[00:44:24.225 --> 00:44:31.510]  And I said, here's the thing that I want to... To me, this is the bomb.
[00:44:31.530 --> 00:44:33.111]  Bring up the CIA stuff.
[00:44:33.131 --> 00:44:34.012]  Yeah, yeah, bring that up.
[00:44:34.628 --> 00:44:36.910]  Well, C.I.A., brother, I don't know C.I.A.
[00:44:36.970 --> 00:44:37.410]  No, no, no.
[00:44:37.490 --> 00:44:38.431]  Tell me what you told me.
[00:44:38.591 --> 00:44:41.874]  But, I mean, get into the fact that you're saying he knew he would be president forever.
[00:44:42.114 --> 00:44:43.555]  I mean, repeat what you told me off-air.
[00:44:44.215 --> 00:44:45.396]  Well, you just stole my thunder.
[00:44:45.536 --> 00:44:46.057]  Well, go ahead.
[00:44:46.097 --> 00:44:46.337]  Say it.
[00:44:48.178 --> 00:44:48.739]  Now, look.
[00:44:48.879 --> 00:44:53.582]  Look, I said, I said, how long did he know he was going to be president?
[00:44:53.802 --> 00:44:55.284]  He said, well, he knew from 1998.
[00:44:55.404 --> 00:44:58.026]  And I said, from childhood?
[00:44:58.046 --> 00:44:58.866]  He goes, I don't know.
[00:44:58.886 --> 00:45:01.008]  I said, but definitely 1998.
[00:45:01.048 --> 00:45:02.249]  He goes, and maybe earlier.
[00:45:03.604 --> 00:45:05.706]  Now this is a man that hasn't done anything.
[00:45:07.528 --> 00:45:09.590]  And Alex, you and I talk about this.
[00:45:10.210 --> 00:45:11.852]  Do I have time or are you going to cut me off?
[00:45:11.892 --> 00:45:12.432]  Yes, you've got time.
[00:45:12.873 --> 00:45:13.013]  Do it.
[00:45:13.033 --> 00:45:13.233]  Okay.
[00:45:14.034 --> 00:45:27.707]  Folks, you know, I understand people, you know, you hate George W. Bush, but then the people that love Obama and he does all the same stuff, I don't care if people hate Obama or hate Bush or hate, as long as they're intellectually honest.
[00:45:28.812 --> 00:45:35.298]  This party-first Nazi attitude, you know, well, yeah, they're rounding up my neighbors I love, but I'm, hey, I'm part of the party.
[00:45:36.219 --> 00:45:37.800]  This party-first attitude frightens me.
[00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:43.205]  I just want people, you can hate me, you can hate Alex, you can love Obama, you can hate the Bush, you can hate whatever.
[00:45:43.626 --> 00:45:45.627]  But I just want you to be honest with yourself.
[00:45:47.009 --> 00:45:52.093]  Have you known anyone, I think of my friend Rusty Humphreys whose dad was killed in Vietnam.
[00:45:52.373 --> 00:45:54.996]  Here's a couple of little, you know, blurry pictures.
[00:45:55.868 --> 00:46:01.272]  Anyone in your family, anybody you've ever known that went to Vietnam, they had a couple... I mean, think of what the technology was.
[00:46:01.752 --> 00:46:04.074]  And yet John Kerry had film crews.
[00:46:04.654 --> 00:46:05.655]  John Kerry was a nobody.
[00:46:06.255 --> 00:46:08.917]  John Kerry has color footage of him fighting in Vietnam.
[00:46:10.278 --> 00:46:11.739]  The boy from Hope, Arkansas.
[00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:13.360]  From a divorced family.
[00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:14.721]  A nobody.
[00:46:16.283 --> 00:46:20.125]  Bill Clinton has pictures as a child of him hanging out with JFK.
[00:46:22.607 --> 00:46:25.129]  Dwight D. Eisenhower's granddaughter told me
[00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:28.963]  That these people know from birth.
[00:46:29.003 --> 00:46:30.184]  I think of the boys from Brazil.
[00:46:30.785 --> 00:46:31.726]  That old movie.
[00:46:31.766 --> 00:46:32.227]  But whatever.
[00:46:33.128 --> 00:46:39.075]  I just wonder, I mean it really... Obama knew in 98 he was going to be president.
[00:46:39.716 --> 00:46:41.718]  Who are... Alex, you claim to know.
[00:46:42.859 --> 00:46:43.941]  You've been right on so much.
[00:46:44.835 --> 00:46:45.215]  I don't know.
[00:46:45.235 --> 00:46:47.296]  I don't have any clue.
[00:46:47.316 --> 00:46:50.097]  100% Bill Clinton was a CIA project.
[00:46:50.497 --> 00:46:54.859]  He is the son of the former governor, the Rockefeller governor.
[00:46:54.959 --> 00:46:56.679]  His mother was a lady of the night.
[00:46:57.200 --> 00:46:58.500]  They decided to have the baby.
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:03.542]  That's why he's broken down and cried on TV and said there were only two people that thought he could be president.
[00:47:04.262 --> 00:47:15.934]  In 1962 when he met Kennedy and that was his mama and David Rockefeller, thank you David Rockefeller, and he broke down and cried because the Rockefellers took care of him because he was an illegitimate child of the family.
[00:47:16.295 --> 00:47:18.557]  He was then put into a CIA program in high school.
[00:47:18.938 --> 00:47:22.461]  He then became one of the head CIA people by the late 60s.
[00:47:23.522 --> 00:47:31.786]  Under the CIA section chief, we have the names with Hillary, in England, and then he was sent to Russia as a deep cover spy.
[00:47:32.467 --> 00:47:35.028]  He's been CIA since high school at least.
[00:47:35.448 --> 00:47:40.230]  Same thing with Obama, his mother, his grandfather, his mother, that's all been partially declassified.
[00:47:40.250 --> 00:47:45.873]  It is amazing that Bill Clinton was hanging out in Russia when he was.
[00:47:47.174 --> 00:47:49.475]  But anyway, look, Alex, I don't know who is
[00:47:52.409 --> 00:47:53.510]  Who's picking these people?
[00:47:54.110 --> 00:48:08.401]  But it does seem scripted, it does seem like, I mean look, everything that Bush did, and you can play all the audio, everything that Bush did, Obama's doing, so no matter how we vote, we get more of them, and I mean the government, I mean the Republicans that are selling out.
[00:48:08.421 --> 00:48:16.408]  And look at Bush Senior, head of the CIA, look at Bush Junior, clearly was in the CIA earlier, and all of this,
[00:48:17.168 --> 00:48:23.410]  Is how they put in, just like foreign governments used to try to bring people into a country, get them to run for president or prime minister later to infiltrate.
[00:48:23.691 --> 00:48:27.132]  That's why we have rules against foreign-born being president here like Schwarzenegger.
[00:48:27.592 --> 00:48:32.374]  It's the same thing, but this is a corporate long-term strategic takeover plan.
[00:48:34.446 --> 00:48:40.031]  Brother, look, like everything else you say, I hope it's not true.
[00:48:40.411 --> 00:48:45.215]  I'd like to think that any child can be born an American, and if he does it right, he can be President.
[00:48:45.295 --> 00:48:45.775]  I don't know.
[00:48:45.815 --> 00:48:47.576]  Sure, but let me ask you this.
[00:48:49.238 --> 00:48:54.462]  Lennox, rising actor, top actor on TV, movies, great actor.
[00:48:55.543 --> 00:49:02.348]  Why do you think he started off-air talking so much trash about Obama?
[00:49:03.268 --> 00:49:04.849]  Well, you know what, Alex?
[00:49:05.109 --> 00:49:05.990]  The show is over.
[00:49:07.311 --> 00:49:09.513]  I don't know that... I didn't know the man.
[00:49:10.433 --> 00:49:14.917]  And I want to tell you, he's one of the finest human beings I've ever met in my life.
[00:49:14.937 --> 00:49:19.941]  I... I... I don't know that he wouldn't have talked about it on air.
[00:49:20.041 --> 00:49:22.222]  And I hope I'm not violating your confidence.
[00:49:23.103 --> 00:49:25.665]  But look, this guy walked out and said it in front of my whole staff.
[00:49:25.845 --> 00:49:26.766]  Hey, hey, hey, hey!
[00:49:26.786 --> 00:49:28.307]  I would have said this is off record.
[00:49:28.447 --> 00:49:28.927]  Exactly.
[00:49:29.348 --> 00:49:30.929]  He should have said that so it's on record.
[00:49:31.553 --> 00:49:36.295]  Well, and look, I have, you know, my shows broadcast on TV in Chicago.
[00:49:36.415 --> 00:49:37.895]  They're TV cameras in the studio, yeah.
[00:49:38.555 --> 00:49:41.816]  I had, you know, we're at the Fox Studios in Chicago, right on Michigan Avenue.
[00:49:41.836 --> 00:49:47.258]  I mean, I had camera people, producers, four or five people.
[00:49:47.298 --> 00:49:49.299]  We stood around and we listened to them.
[00:49:49.319 --> 00:49:50.999]  I don't think I'm violating the confidence.
[00:49:51.039 --> 00:49:52.099]  I hope I don't hurt the man.
[00:49:52.139 --> 00:49:53.560]  I think the blacklist is great.
[00:49:53.900 --> 00:49:56.901]  I don't like, like you, I don't like any of this mainstream TV.
[00:49:57.361 --> 00:49:59.102]  I happen to like the blacklist a great deal.
[00:49:59.142 --> 00:49:59.922]  I don't want to hurt the man.
[00:50:00.842 --> 00:50:01.963]  But he did say it.
[00:50:02.023 --> 00:50:02.364]  He did.
[00:50:02.684 --> 00:50:04.906]  And if you watch the guy, it's funny.
[00:50:04.927 --> 00:50:07.029]  I mean, he is Obama.
[00:50:07.549 --> 00:50:08.911]  And he says Obama's a nothing.
[00:50:09.051 --> 00:50:11.133]  Alex, I've spent time with Obama.
[00:50:11.774 --> 00:50:13.696]  I spent time with Obama before he was anybody.
[00:50:14.437 --> 00:50:15.578]  And there's nothing there.
[00:50:15.658 --> 00:50:18.701]  Look, I could explain to everybody who Obama is.
[00:50:18.741 --> 00:50:20.563]  If you give me 30 seconds, I'll explain it.
[00:50:21.745 --> 00:50:21.965]  Do it.
[00:50:22.668 --> 00:50:22.988]  Okay.
[00:50:23.528 --> 00:50:26.889]  I dated a girl that was severely abused by several stepdads.
[00:50:27.409 --> 00:50:31.731]  She was molested, she was abandoned, and she was whatever you wanted her to be.
[00:50:31.751 --> 00:50:33.691]  Okay?
[00:50:34.571 --> 00:50:37.412]  And what I mean by that is, it's a defense mechanism.
[00:50:37.712 --> 00:50:41.493]  I think Obama probably had a miserable childhood, and he's a nothing.
[00:50:42.273 --> 00:50:43.314]  There was no father.
[00:50:43.794 --> 00:50:45.434]  There was the mother that abandoned him.
[00:50:45.794 --> 00:50:51.056]  She was chasin' after... You know, so much has been hidden about her, but she was...
[00:50:52.071 --> 00:50:53.692]  It wouldn't have been too hard to sleep with her.
[00:50:53.712 --> 00:50:54.512]  No, no, no.
[00:50:54.552 --> 00:50:55.673]  His mother was in porn.
[00:50:56.733 --> 00:51:00.235]  So, you know, he was dumped off in Kansas.
[00:51:00.455 --> 00:51:01.516]  Tell you what, final segment.

[00:54:28.612 --> 00:54:32.393]  Alright, final segment with Mancow.
[00:54:32.433 --> 00:54:38.055]  You can follow him on Twitter, we'll put that up on screen for TV viewers here in a moment.
[00:54:38.415 --> 00:54:41.796]  But he was getting into Harry Lennox, who's a big actor.
[00:54:41.996 --> 00:54:46.898]  We looked it up on record, been friends with Obama for 15 years or so, or longer.
[00:54:47.718 --> 00:54:54.420]  And he told Mancow, and Mancow on your words, folks can follow you at Mancow Muller on Twitter,
[00:54:55.140 --> 00:54:55.400]  Yeah.
[00:55:14.318 --> 00:55:21.645]  To literally try to train him up, I guess, for the Senate seat at the state level and then the federal level.
[00:55:21.846 --> 00:55:23.027]  And he did just come out of nowhere.
[00:55:23.347 --> 00:55:29.734]  This is bombshell news, but I don't expect them to even pick this up because the establishment obviously doesn't want this info out.
[00:55:30.134 --> 00:55:33.017]  But recap anything else that Lennox said and finish your point.
[00:55:33.735 --> 00:55:37.258]  Well, look, I don't know where to begin, Alex.
[00:55:38.079 --> 00:55:40.481]  He said that Obama shadowed him, that he couldn't shake him.
[00:55:41.081 --> 00:55:45.045]  It was kind of like a booger on your finger, is kind of the feeling I got, that he couldn't shake him.
[00:55:45.965 --> 00:55:52.871]  And that there's nothing there, and that's the point I wanted to make about abused children, that, you know, in order to protect themselves, they want to make everybody happy.
[00:55:53.872 --> 00:56:00.818]  So as I sat talking to Obama, you know, he was Christian with me, he was Muslim with the next person that came over and talked to him.
[00:56:01.938 --> 00:56:04.481]  And he's whatever you want him to be, but there's nothing there.
[00:56:05.401 --> 00:56:06.863]  And that's basically what Lennox was saying.
[00:56:06.883 --> 00:56:08.024]  There's nothing there.
[00:56:08.064 --> 00:56:09.966]  He's just a... He's an empty vessel.
[00:56:10.026 --> 00:56:11.287]  He's whatever you want him to be.
[00:56:12.528 --> 00:56:14.150]  And perfect to be manipulated.
[00:56:14.210 --> 00:56:15.191]  A perfect puppet.
[00:56:16.031 --> 00:56:18.013]  You know, I thought about...
[00:56:19.474 --> 00:56:29.159]  When Brian Henson was in my studio and Kermit was sitting there and it was just a green, a green glob, but it came to life once his hand was there, you know, once the hand, uh, was manipulating.
[00:56:29.179 --> 00:56:30.079]  And that's kind of Obama.
[00:56:30.139 --> 00:56:31.840]  He's, he's just kind of, there's nothing there.
[00:56:31.900 --> 00:56:32.420]  It's dead.
[00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:40.044]  Uh, until, uh, his backers, his controllers, uh, put the, put, you know, put what he needs to say on the teleprompter.
[00:56:40.444 --> 00:56:41.305]  Uh, there's nothing there.
[00:56:41.465 --> 00:56:42.505]  I mean, he's very stupid.
[00:56:42.945 --> 00:56:44.026]  I, I talked with him, Alex.
[00:56:44.106 --> 00:56:44.546]  You know that.
[00:56:45.207 --> 00:56:46.707]  I spent time with him before he was anybody.
[00:56:46.747 --> 00:56:47.828]  I knew more about the church.
[00:56:48.624 --> 00:56:51.006]  That abomination of a courage before I knew about Obama.
[00:56:51.046 --> 00:56:59.073]  But Lennox is a brilliant actor, and if you watch him, that's what Obama's supposed to act like.
[00:57:00.354 --> 00:57:01.656]  The take-charge leader.
[00:57:02.887 --> 00:57:09.090]  And it's weird, because when you watch Lennox, I thought he was copying Obama in Superman and in TV shows and stuff.
[00:57:09.350 --> 00:57:17.435]  And I guess that's why Lennox is irritated, because he's seeing he trained Obama, and now he sees him up there destroying the country, playing the part of Harry Lennox.
[00:57:17.815 --> 00:57:18.275]  This is huge.
[00:57:18.595 --> 00:57:20.516]  Mancow, thank you so much for the time and your courage.
[00:57:20.576 --> 00:57:21.677]  Hey, hey, hey, Alex?
[00:57:21.997 --> 00:57:22.297]  Yes, sir?
[00:57:23.218 --> 00:57:24.018]  I want to say this.
[00:57:24.178 --> 00:57:26.780]  I really believe that Lennox is one of the finest people I've ever met.
[00:57:27.500 --> 00:57:31.222]  I think that he probably wasn't aware of how this would go with Obama.
[00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:37.416]  He did know back in 98 that Obama was telling him he was going to be president.
[00:57:37.656 --> 00:57:38.920]  I don't think Harry believed that.
[00:57:39.961 --> 00:57:44.205]  And I do think that Harry Lennox loves this country, so I really do believe that.
[00:57:44.225 --> 00:57:47.028]  Yeah, and I think for Harry's own safety, it's good this is out now.
[00:57:47.088 --> 00:57:47.809]  Contact Lennox.
[00:57:48.069 --> 00:57:49.210]  Hey, help us get him on, Mankow.
[00:57:49.230 --> 00:57:50.031]  We'll have him on with you.
[00:57:50.051 --> 00:57:51.592]  So I think we should flesh this out now.
[00:57:51.612 --> 00:57:52.313]  This is a big deal.
[00:57:52.533 --> 00:57:53.534]  Thank you very much, Mankow.
[00:57:54.014 --> 00:57:54.255]  See ya.
[00:57:54.635 --> 00:57:56.817]  Alright, there goes Eric Mankow Muller.

[00:58:58.110 --> 00:58:59.110]  I had tried everything.
[00:58:59.170 --> 00:59:01.311]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[00:59:01.531 --> 00:59:04.232]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[00:59:04.652 --> 00:59:09.133]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements, as well as key vitamins.
[00:59:09.493 --> 00:59:15.855]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.

[01:00:40.006 --> 01:00:41.408]  I'm gonna crystallize for you.
[01:00:41.488 --> 01:00:42.870]  In fact, guys, I meant to ask you in the break.
[01:00:43.191 --> 01:00:45.374]  Will you print me a transcript of that abomination?
[01:00:47.245 --> 01:00:52.309]  That Obama just put out his whole 30-minute regurgitation of old lies.
[01:00:52.629 --> 01:00:59.675]  Because for the nightly news tonight, but also on the radio show today, we have all the clips of him saying, you can keep your plan under this legislation, Obamacare, period.
[01:01:00.195 --> 01:01:01.536]  And then he said, I never said that.
[01:01:01.897 --> 01:01:03.038]  And then he said, OK, I did say it.
[01:01:03.058 --> 01:01:03.578]  I'm sorry.
[01:01:04.239 --> 01:01:08.102]  And then today, he's like, well, it's not working as well as it should, but it's working pretty darn great.
[01:01:08.962 --> 01:01:11.965]  But by the way, I'm going to let you have your old plans now.
[01:01:12.325 --> 01:01:13.106]  This is exactly
[01:01:14.147 --> 01:01:31.371]  Look, what they did with the whole banker bailout bill in 2008, and the subsequent bank regulations, and all the housing market changes were, okay, we'll let you keep your house now if you sign this new agreement, which even waived more of your rights.
[01:01:32.852 --> 01:01:33.792]  And then they take your house.
[01:01:33.812 --> 01:01:42.454]  Look, we're going to let you, as soon as Obama got in in 2009, I'm going to let you keep that house now, and then you just pay six months more, and then they screw you out of that money.
[01:01:43.933 --> 01:01:48.535]  They just came in with a deal to let you get deeper into the mortgage, and that's exactly what this was.
[01:01:49.455 --> 01:02:00.058]  I was just watching CNN, and they were saying, Obama's going to get a big boost out of this, turning defeat into victory, snatching victory from the jaws of defeat.
[01:02:01.179 --> 01:02:04.580]  This is a great plan, he's going to let you keep your plan, he's going to fix it.
[01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:09.021]  And all they're doing is stalling it.
[01:02:09.121 --> 01:02:10.942]  And of course, Larry Summers said this yesterday.
[01:02:11.789 --> 01:02:15.292]  The architect of the derivative scam, the chief scam artist, living.
[01:02:16.212 --> 01:02:19.054]  I mean, if you want to say somebody's captaining the ship of scam, it's him.
[01:02:19.494 --> 01:02:20.035]  Here's Summers.
[01:02:20.315 --> 01:02:25.699]  But if you look at the medium run and the long run, the important thing that's happened for growth
[01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:31.863]  Is that in the last three years since Obamacare was passed, we have bent the curve on healthcare costs.
[01:02:32.523 --> 01:02:47.291]  For the first time since the Second World War, healthcare as a share of GDP has stopped going up, and that offers huge promise with respect to the future of the federal deficit, which looks much less serious than it did
[01:02:47.791 --> 01:02:54.854]  Even a couple of years ago, it means much less burdens on businesses, which means more competitive American producers.
[01:02:55.214 --> 01:03:00.336]  It means the ability to pass on higher wages to American workers.
[01:03:00.716 --> 01:03:03.177]  So let's keep some perspective here.
[01:03:03.638 --> 01:03:15.402]  We have had an outcome with respect to health care costs that is well beyond what anything... The average health care cost has doubled and that's on record, you lying piece of trash.
[01:03:15.502 --> 01:03:16.383]  I mean, I just...
[01:03:16.943 --> 01:03:22.765]  But you gotta understand, people watch CNN and MSNBC when that snaggletooth lizard gets up there.
[01:03:22.785 --> 01:03:33.189]  And he could literally sit there in the backyard with Labrador Retriever droppings and put it in white bread and tell people it was a chocolate sandwich.
[01:03:34.049 --> 01:03:36.330]  And I'm telling you, his supporters would shove it in their mouth and eat it.
[01:03:38.311 --> 01:03:42.393]  I mean, I hate to talk like that, but these people literally are telling us to eat.
[01:03:42.453 --> 01:03:42.933]  You know why?
[01:03:44.091 --> 01:03:45.252]  Oh, I just can't handle it anymore.
[01:03:45.292 --> 01:03:46.773]  This job, man, I need a vacation.
[01:03:46.933 --> 01:03:47.373]  I tell ya.
[01:03:47.773 --> 01:03:50.815]  The fact that I have to focus on these scumbags all day.
[01:03:50.835 --> 01:03:52.476]  I got to do it, though.
[01:03:52.496 --> 01:03:53.257]  We've got to stop them.
[01:03:53.357 --> 01:03:54.418]  I know why people are in denial.
[01:03:54.498 --> 01:03:56.939]  It's like you're sick of looking at these people, and I get it.
[01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:04.384]  It's funner to go learn about male soap operas like football and, you know, have all your guys you got crushes on and everything.
[01:04:04.404 --> 01:04:07.346]  In a giant, latent, homosexual country.
[01:04:07.406 --> 01:04:11.128]  But, you know, the whole issue here, nothing against that, guys.
[01:04:11.168 --> 01:04:12.069]  You like it, I understand.
[01:04:13.151 --> 01:04:17.852]  Watch the quarterback get down there by the center and everything and rub on his rumpus and everything.
[01:04:18.492 --> 01:04:19.852]  I'm going to stop right there.
[01:04:20.052 --> 01:04:20.553]  I'm sorry.
[01:04:20.633 --> 01:04:22.113]  Just a little bit of humor.
[01:04:22.173 --> 01:04:23.013]  I apologize.
[01:04:23.853 --> 01:04:24.753]  I apologize.
[01:04:24.833 --> 01:04:25.814]  I'm going to stop right there.
[01:04:27.734 --> 01:04:28.654]  It's gallows humor.
[01:04:28.734 --> 01:04:32.315]  It's sarcasm, ladies and gentlemen, to a point.
[01:04:32.355 --> 01:04:36.276]  But you know, all real funny humor has a large kernel of truth at the heart of it.
[01:04:37.006 --> 01:04:40.368]  Uh, but, uh, we're gonna go to break and I'm gonna reset and try to get focused.
[01:04:40.988 --> 01:04:47.151]  Just looking at Larry Summers and his total BS mobile, uh, is something hard for me to deal with.
[01:04:48.432 --> 01:04:53.734]  And, uh, Obozo, uh, again is now promising that he's gonna fix the plan, which I told you.
[01:04:54.134 --> 01:04:59.597]  And now all his idiot supporters will just be rope-a-doped again until the country totally implodes.
[01:05:00.478 --> 01:05:05.300]  All the big insurance companies isolate everyone and strip-mine everyone, as Dylan Rattigan said.
[01:05:07.478 --> 01:05:13.080]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[01:05:13.281 --> 01:05:20.504]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[01:05:20.684 --> 01:05:23.845]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[01:05:24.005 --> 01:05:25.806]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[01:05:26.046 --> 01:05:30.608]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[01:05:30.688 --> 01:05:33.449]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[01:05:33.609 --> 01:05:39.391]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[01:05:39.571 --> 01:05:43.033]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[01:05:43.233 --> 01:05:48.295]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine.
[01:05:48.495 --> 01:05:51.476]  Exclusively available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:05:51.716 --> 01:05:57.582]  Nascent Iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.
[01:05:57.702 --> 01:05:59.704]  Survival Shield Nascent Iodine.

[01:06:08.212 --> 01:06:13.296]  Alex Jones here, and I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show, My Patriot Supply.
[01:06:13.676 --> 01:06:22.141]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[01:06:22.562 --> 01:06:29.867]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow Patriots.
[01:06:30.387 --> 01:06:37.792]  My Patriot Supply brings us their exclusive Patriot Pantry brand, along with many other fine preparedness products.
[01:06:38.292 --> 01:06:41.695]  I personally store and use their high-quality products.
[01:06:42.236 --> 01:06:45.879]  It tastes great, and it's easy to store for up to 25 years.
[01:06:46.419 --> 01:06:53.025]  For a limited time, you can save $50 instantly on a four-week supply of food, along with other special offers.

[01:07:00.792 --> 01:07:04.836]  It is essential to prepare with My Patriot Supply today.

[01:07:12.751 --> 01:07:17.153]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[01:07:17.333 --> 01:07:23.276]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[01:07:23.396 --> 01:07:34.181]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.
[01:07:34.381 --> 01:07:40.705]  It is the only one that does it, and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[01:07:40.885 --> 01:07:57.874]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands, and sodium hexafluorosilicate.

[01:08:12.524 --> 01:08:13.165]  Big Brother.
[01:08:13.825 --> 01:08:14.866]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:15.607 --> 01:08:16.748]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:17.348 --> 01:08:18.169]  You want answers?
[01:08:18.949 --> 01:08:19.810]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:20.290 --> 01:08:24.133]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:24.673 --> 01:08:28.756]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:34.848 --> 01:08:36.389]  Folks, we're in hour number two.
[01:08:36.589 --> 01:08:37.370]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:08:37.390 --> 01:08:40.713]  We're going to have wide open phones in this hour.
[01:08:40.853 --> 01:08:48.719]  We have a special guest, a heavily wounded combat veteran who's an amazing artist and a pro-Second Amendment activist.
[01:08:48.739 --> 01:08:51.982]  He's going to be joining us coming up in studio.
[01:08:53.143 --> 01:08:57.947]  And he is another remarkable example of human resilience.
[01:08:58.922 --> 01:09:02.144]  Because I would describe his wounds as Darth Vader level.
[01:09:02.645 --> 01:09:27.642]  Mario Lopez is going to be in Studio Paintings by MarioLopez.com and he is an established artist in his own right and he's going to be coming on and also talk about his journey, a religious journey and how he's made it through his adversities and he'll obviously give us some combat perspectives as a veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan in
[01:09:28.749 --> 01:09:39.054]  A lot of heavy combat, so that's coming up at the start of the next hour.
[01:09:40.454 --> 01:09:45.937]  And so we're going to talk about a host of issues with him coming up.
[01:09:46.977 --> 01:09:49.118]  But we're going to have open phones right now and cover the news.
[01:09:49.178 --> 01:10:00.084]  What's your response to the front man-in-chief, the fraudster-in-chief up there for 30 minutes, saying, OK, now they're going to let you keep your existing plan that 10-plus million people have been kicked off of.
[01:10:00.124 --> 01:10:03.466]  McClatchy says it'll be 52 million that are kicked off total.
[01:10:03.886 --> 01:10:05.207]  And then there's no move to do that.
[01:10:05.227 --> 01:10:08.489]  They're just going to call it your existing plan, but then increase the plan.
[01:10:09.617 --> 01:10:13.760]  So, this is the scam of scams going on.
[01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:21.805]  And meanwhile, the bigger scam is that they're kicking off more than 40 million people are being cut to part-time wages.
[01:10:22.625 --> 01:10:28.189]  Because Obamacare was written by big business to lower wages of the average American.
[01:10:30.130 --> 01:10:37.295]  That's why they're going to raise the minimum wage again, but you're going to only get half as much work, and then they're going to tell you, supplementally, go on welfare.
[01:10:38.317 --> 01:10:42.138]  So that is the basic, basic plan on that front.
[01:10:42.538 --> 01:10:48.840]  And if you go over the transcript of his speech, I know I've watched clips of it, it's basically reissuing the same lie now.
[01:10:49.140 --> 01:10:51.881]  He's already gone through, you can keep your plan under this bill, period.
[01:10:51.901 --> 01:10:53.602]  Then he said, I never said that.
[01:10:53.622 --> 01:10:57.143]  Then he said, okay, I'm sorry that the plan isn't perfect, but it's working pretty good.
[01:10:57.623 --> 01:11:02.805]  Now he said that again, but said, now we're going to work on letting you keep your old plan.
[01:11:03.592 --> 01:11:07.877]  But you've already been kicked off of it and they're just going to kick you off and you're going to say, that's not true.
[01:11:07.897 --> 01:11:09.318]  And see, how do I know this?
[01:11:09.378 --> 01:11:11.501]  Well, I've watched it so many times in other countries and here.
[01:11:11.521 --> 01:11:21.372]  2009, they had these assistance acts passed and stimulus acts and a bunch of other stuff passed to have homeowners not kicked out of their houses.
[01:11:22.588 --> 01:11:29.872]  But all it would do was basically increase your mortgage and then if you ever missed one payment, you waive all your rights and instantly lose your house.
[01:11:29.932 --> 01:11:34.155]  So it let the banks get a little more money out of you and then take the house cleaner later.
[01:11:35.016 --> 01:11:39.618]  And waive your rights because they had you in fraudulent mortgages and it sold them.
[01:11:39.939 --> 01:11:41.539]  So, so, oh I got a deal for you.
[01:11:42.220 --> 01:11:43.481]  You're going to be able to keep your house.
[01:11:43.541 --> 01:11:45.882]  The deal is I waive my rights and you're allowed to screw me.
[01:11:46.302 --> 01:11:47.103]  And then I lose my house.
[01:11:48.582 --> 01:11:53.284]  But by the millions, people toddled in and signed the agreements and then lost their houses anyways and more money.
[01:11:55.385 --> 01:11:56.905]  It's the art of betrayal.
[01:11:57.386 --> 01:11:58.886]  This is how con artists operate.
[01:11:58.906 --> 01:12:02.628]  This is how... I've been saying this for several months, how the Nigerian emails work.
[01:12:03.248 --> 01:12:04.128]  They get 5,000 promising 15 million.
[01:12:06.684 --> 01:12:11.867]  Then, oh my gosh, Prince Abubi needs another $10,000 and then he will call you and you will get the $15,000,000.
[01:12:12.988 --> 01:12:15.610]  We're sorry, Prince Abubi has been detained and arrested.
[01:12:15.970 --> 01:12:18.212]  He needs $20,000 to get out of jail and he will give you $50,000,000.
[01:12:19.613 --> 01:12:21.794]  Then you never hear from Prince Abubi again.
[01:12:23.375 --> 01:12:27.018]  Now, Ted Cruz and Ann Coulter have now picked up my exact analogy.
[01:12:27.278 --> 01:12:28.479]  Which is great, that's what everybody does.
[01:12:29.341 --> 01:12:29.641]  All of them.
[01:12:29.681 --> 01:12:30.422]  Glenn Beck, you name it.
[01:12:30.642 --> 01:12:31.102]  I like that.
[01:12:31.463 --> 01:12:33.004]  That's the real power of this show.
[01:12:33.444 --> 01:12:38.048]  It's not even the 15 million we reach a week, or the millions a day with InfoWars.com.
[01:12:39.649 --> 01:12:47.135]  It is that we speak common sense, and now we're actually creating a common sense talking point for folks to understand.
[01:12:48.536 --> 01:12:52.978]  So the toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:12:53.018 --> 01:12:55.960]  First-time callers, your take on Obama's speech.
[01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:57.581]  Do you believe him this time?
[01:12:58.141 --> 01:13:01.563]  If you do, I've got some oceanfront property in Arizona.
[01:13:02.003 --> 01:13:04.424]  And from my front porch, you can see the sea.
[01:13:06.925 --> 01:13:09.787]  And of course, if you'll buy that, I'll throw the Golden Gate in free.
[01:13:11.348 --> 01:13:14.029]  And if you buy that, I wrote that song, not George Strait.
[01:13:15.250 --> 01:13:15.971]  I'm being sarcastic.
[01:13:15.991 --> 01:13:18.753]  He, George Strait, at least knows how to sing it.
[01:13:19.073 --> 01:13:22.035]  The point is, I think it was in, like, high school when that song came out?
[01:13:22.255 --> 01:13:22.916]  That's a joke, folks.
[01:13:22.956 --> 01:13:23.796]  I'm not saying I wrote that.
[01:13:23.836 --> 01:13:29.821]  I'm acting like, you know, the absurdity of, I've got some oceanfront property in Arizona and from my front porch you can see the sea.
[01:13:29.841 --> 01:13:33.263]  And if you'll buy that, I'll throw the Golden Gate in free.
[01:13:34.564 --> 01:13:37.606]  Cause I don't love you, now if you'll buy that.
[01:13:37.626 --> 01:13:40.689]  This is the entire art
[01:13:42.481 --> 01:13:48.602]  of betrayal over and over and over again as everybody's isolated.
[01:13:48.903 --> 01:13:50.043]  That's why they don't want families.
[01:13:50.383 --> 01:13:51.843]  They don't want men and women together.
[01:13:53.204 --> 01:13:55.704]  Listen, women are just as smart as men are smarter.
[01:13:55.744 --> 01:13:58.665]  They have triple the connections between left and right hemisphere.
[01:13:58.685 --> 01:14:02.526]  Hitler said first you get the women and you've got the children so follow the men.
[01:14:02.546 --> 01:14:07.447]  83% last time I checked of purchases are decided on by women.
[01:14:08.618 --> 01:14:12.840]  And so most of the propaganda targets women, and women on average are more emotional.
[01:14:15.201 --> 01:14:17.642]  And so the whole system says, women, you're in charge now.
[01:14:17.942 --> 01:14:19.003]  Your man's the problem.
[01:14:19.283 --> 01:14:21.844]  You get him in line, we'll run society safe.
[01:14:22.324 --> 01:14:26.186]  That's what house slaves were in Rome, and then in other civilizations, were the women.
[01:14:26.546 --> 01:14:31.768]  Because you could, they found slave masters going back thousands of years in Babylon, Egypt, you name it.
[01:14:32.048 --> 01:14:37.311]  And in Rome, women made better administrators under a government over men.
[01:14:39.873 --> 01:14:40.995]  And that's what all this is.
[01:14:41.015 --> 01:14:49.465]  You get women in, you say, we're doing this to be reasonable, we're doing this to be friendly, and they will try to be compliant and try to work within the system.
[01:14:49.945 --> 01:14:51.888]  And that works great in a village of a hundred people.
[01:14:55.097 --> 01:15:04.123]  The men all come in from battle or whatever, bleeding, the women take care of them, cook, feed them, send them back out as machines to go get the food and go kill the enemy for us.
[01:15:04.684 --> 01:15:09.547]  But in a modern system, we come back and we're with a programmed creature.
[01:15:10.167 --> 01:15:19.974]  Programmed with all these false ideas where the man's always weak, the man's always bad, the man gets home, he's working two jobs, you're working one job, but still he needs to clean, Gloria Steinem said.
[01:15:20.815 --> 01:15:22.516]  The kids don't even need to clean, he needs to clean.
[01:15:24.366 --> 01:15:26.107]  And if you make him dinner, that's a lowly thing.
[01:15:26.367 --> 01:15:34.131]  That way your family's broke up, the state's your man, he's your pimp, and then you create kids that'll be warriors and workers for the state.
[01:15:34.451 --> 01:15:35.432]  You're now a drone.
[01:15:36.012 --> 01:15:37.833]  The woman's a drone, the man's a drone.
[01:15:38.513 --> 01:15:39.614]  That's modern feminism.
[01:15:39.874 --> 01:15:42.756]  Which they sell as, it's for the women, cigarettes!
[01:15:42.856 --> 01:15:43.856]  Oh, I better smoke those.
[01:15:44.557 --> 01:15:46.538]  It's for the women, don't ever have kids.
[01:15:47.838 --> 01:15:48.719]  It's for the women,
[01:15:50.609 --> 01:15:53.813]  And they sell the idea, and then look how disempowered women are.
[01:15:54.114 --> 01:15:55.295]  Making less money than ever.
[01:15:55.616 --> 01:15:56.777]  Total objects.
[01:15:58.279 --> 01:16:00.221]  The society degenerating around us.
[01:16:01.451 --> 01:16:08.538]  So that we're all isolated and now, and of course the men are taught, go look at guys four hours a day while your wife's upstairs.
[01:16:09.259 --> 01:16:23.935]  Go look at other men all day in spandex, grabbing each other with other men all day, imagining looking at so-called warriors in simulated combat and then bragging to each other the strategy and how male you are.
[01:16:25.376 --> 01:16:29.798]  Because you figured out all the moves and all the plays and you know what the coach is going to do.
[01:16:30.058 --> 01:16:32.519]  You're supposed to be combat measuring the government.
[01:16:32.759 --> 01:16:35.520]  You're supposed to be affecting the future battlescape.
[01:16:35.540 --> 01:16:37.281]  You're supposed to be in combat in business.
[01:16:37.561 --> 01:16:42.323]  You're supposed to be in combat raising your sons and daughters to be strong and honorable and not
[01:16:42.663 --> 01:16:47.987]  Trusting corrupt people and learning how to only work with those that are honorable and good.
[01:16:48.007 --> 01:16:57.473]  You're supposed to be building a family name, building a family empire, aggressively defending each other, aggressively having fealty towards one another, as a combat unit.
[01:16:57.973 --> 01:17:00.035]  This planet has been total war!
[01:17:00.475 --> 01:17:13.838]  Total death against big cats, big bears, lions, tigers, cobras, rattlesnakes, the elements, starvation, other tribes attacking, and your tribe didn't get it together as a cohesive group, you were gone.
[01:17:14.538 --> 01:17:20.240]  And they've come in and just ruined everybody so that we're all just easy to roll over to the point of now
[01:17:22.847 --> 01:17:34.794]  They've taken the most aggressive, freedom-oriented, wildcatting, free-booting country the world's ever seen, and turned us into the most dumbed-down, slovenly, lazy, welfare-junkie fools.
[01:17:35.194 --> 01:17:49.842]  With those of us still working, holding the whole thing up, with total warfare, black against white, hispanic against white, old against young, man against woman, children with all the cartoons, taught to be bad, rebel against their parents, don't discipline your kids so they're out of control.
[01:17:51.462 --> 01:17:54.545]  This is what the Bible talked about in every civilization that was collapsing.
[01:17:55.526 --> 01:17:56.346]  It talked about that.
[01:17:57.307 --> 01:17:57.888]  And we know.
[01:17:58.648 --> 01:18:00.990]  First you get the women, then you've got the children, so follow the men.
[01:18:01.291 --> 01:18:03.653]  The words of Adolf Hitler, look them up.
[01:18:04.413 --> 01:18:06.535]  And Joseph Goebbels also paraphrased that.
[01:18:08.077 --> 01:18:16.304]  It was the women in Nazi Germany that demanded, in a kind of mutated Spartan idea, come home with your shields or on them.
[01:18:18.789 --> 01:18:25.951]  And again, that's normal for the woman to be demanding, go out there and kill the enemy, go out there and bring me a bunch of meat, go out there.
[01:18:25.971 --> 01:18:29.773]  I'm with these kids in the cave, okay?
[01:18:30.953 --> 01:18:32.374]  Defending when you're away.
[01:18:32.774 --> 01:18:35.955]  Women aren't wimps under this empowered natural human system.
[01:18:36.395 --> 01:18:37.235]  They're empowered.
[01:18:38.055 --> 01:18:45.698]  And see, now we're isolated, we're broken, the globalist corporate system is rolling in, moving in, taking over.
[01:18:47.554 --> 01:19:01.239]  The total destruction of the human family, by design, and now they're going to get rid of the health care, they're going to get rid of the jobs, everything is destroyed, the male role model, because once they've taken down the individual man, there's no one to stand at the village.
[01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:07.101]  And the women believe they're having victory against the men with the state.
[01:19:09.522 --> 01:19:12.003]  They believe they're having a victory when they have an abortion.
[01:19:12.796 --> 01:19:25.145]  They believe they're having a victory because they've imprinted on the state and then men have imprinted in an arrested development on going and staring at men's rear ends all day watching the NFL.
[01:19:27.407 --> 01:19:36.534]  And then fantasizing that that's what men do and that that's what men are on growth hormone and steroids and run around running into each other on a field all day.
[01:19:39.762 --> 01:19:44.725]  So it just totally takes all male instincts for three-dimensional chess and survival.
[01:19:44.925 --> 01:19:45.686]  Where to go hunt?
[01:19:45.886 --> 01:19:46.386]  Where to go?
[01:19:46.666 --> 01:19:47.347]  How to prepare?
[01:19:47.587 --> 01:19:48.267]  Where to travel?
[01:19:48.307 --> 01:19:49.248]  That army's too big.
[01:19:49.288 --> 01:19:50.068]  We've got to flee.
[01:19:50.749 --> 01:19:52.150]  We've got to move as nomads.
[01:19:53.010 --> 01:19:54.191]  There's no understanding.
[01:19:54.271 --> 01:19:54.651]  None of it.
[01:19:55.372 --> 01:20:05.758]  All of our development on this planet, out the door, destroyed for the administrative convenience of the ruling class technocrats, who all live traditional lives, by the way, at the very top.
[01:20:06.379 --> 01:20:06.939]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:08.187 --> 01:20:09.769]  Great news, pure water lovers!

[01:21:12.477 --> 01:21:14.878]  If there was no way to get medical help, what would you do?
[01:21:15.118 --> 01:21:21.762]  How are you going to protect the safety of your family during a crisis when there are no doctors, hospitals, emergency services, or supplies?
[01:21:22.182 --> 01:21:24.203]  Supernatural Silver is the answer.

[01:23:06.613 --> 01:23:12.217]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[01:23:12.377 --> 01:23:19.602]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[01:23:19.762 --> 01:23:22.924]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supplies.
[01:23:23.064 --> 01:23:24.845]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[01:23:25.086 --> 01:23:29.669]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[01:23:29.749 --> 01:23:32.491]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[01:23:32.672 --> 01:23:38.456]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[01:23:38.616 --> 01:23:42.099]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[01:23:42.299 --> 01:23:47.323]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine.

[01:23:50.705 --> 01:23:56.588]  Nascent Iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.
[01:23:56.688 --> 01:23:58.709]  Survival Shield Nascent Iodine.

[01:24:21.255 --> 01:24:30.280]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:24:43.268 --> 01:24:44.869]  It's hard to turn this song off right here.
[01:24:44.889 --> 01:24:48.953]  I thought we were playing it on YouTube right now.
[01:24:49.033 --> 01:24:51.035]  Doesn't give old George Strait any justice.
[01:24:52.236 --> 01:24:54.197]  Sounds better in high def in my house.
[01:24:54.337 --> 01:24:57.840]  This is a good music to listen to cooking your kids breakfast.
[01:24:57.861 --> 01:25:03.205]  Here's a good part right here, turn it up.
[01:25:03.225 --> 01:25:06.308]  I don't worship the ground you walk on.
[01:25:06.408 --> 01:25:08.289]  I never have.
[01:25:08.750 --> 01:25:09.771]  And that's a fact.
[01:25:13.496 --> 01:25:16.358]  Get that terrorist off the radio.
[01:25:16.598 --> 01:25:19.600]  Lying about Obamacare.
[01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:21.561]  Alright, let's go ahead.
[01:25:21.621 --> 01:25:24.784]  George Straits from right around here.
[01:25:39.528 --> 01:25:42.330]  From just north of San Antonio, got his start, pretty much the broken spoke.
[01:25:43.431 --> 01:25:47.475]  He won't play Austin anymore, I heard, at least for a while, because they're so smug and trendy.
[01:25:48.336 --> 01:25:51.538]  Anyways, let's go ahead and talk to Matt in Canada.
[01:25:52.019 --> 01:25:52.940]  Matt, you're on the air.
[01:25:52.980 --> 01:25:54.901]  Then Adam, Paul, Dean and Justin.
[01:25:55.682 --> 01:26:04.770]  So, what do you think of Lord, gracious, dear leader Obama saying that he will give you lower health care prices and that Obamacare is a great success?
[01:26:04.790 --> 01:26:05.891]  What do you think about that new speech?
[01:26:07.233 --> 01:26:09.153]  Well, I was just thinking about that.
[01:26:10.094 --> 01:26:21.416]  Not about football and Obama, actually, but if nobody has healthcare and there's a wave of radiation sickness coming from Fukushima, I was just wondering if you thought there was any kind of correlation between those two things.
[01:26:22.356 --> 01:26:29.577]  You know, the globalists don't care that 91% of the 420 plus reactors are leaking now.
[01:26:29.618 --> 01:26:31.138]  They just blow up and leak all the time.
[01:26:31.158 --> 01:26:32.378]  It's not even an issue now.
[01:26:32.398 --> 01:26:36.239]  They just turn the alarms off when they melt down or have partial meltdowns in the U.S.
[01:26:36.279 --> 01:26:36.379]  now.
[01:26:37.515 --> 01:26:38.556]  Just a minor footnote.
[01:26:39.016 --> 01:26:41.237]  So they've waved a magic wand and say radiation is good.
[01:26:41.577 --> 01:26:46.860]  And unless our leaders are really blood-drinking lizards that like radiation, they're crazy.
[01:26:46.900 --> 01:26:52.663]  And of course, I don't think they're blood-drinking lizards that like radiation, so I just think it shows the nihilistic disconnect.
[01:26:52.683 --> 01:26:59.726]  But yes, Obamacare is meant so you can't get real health care, and so you can water down the quality of care, and then deny people health care.
[01:26:59.746 --> 01:27:01.007]  It's all in the legislation.
[01:27:02.077 --> 01:27:15.832]  It's a torpedo to the broad side of the country to lower the wages, make us a part-time nation, force us on welfare, let the insurance companies lower the quality of care, and force 50 million people to buy it, and kick everybody off of it, and make them double down.
[01:27:16.413 --> 01:27:20.718]  And it's a private tax ruled by the Supreme Court to foreign banks.
[01:27:21.298 --> 01:27:22.399]  That own the insurance companies.
[01:27:22.439 --> 01:27:23.940]  I mean, could you think of a better screwjob?
[01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:24.820]  Well, yes.
[01:27:24.901 --> 01:27:32.986]  Now they're moving towards, in North America, taking money out of your account yearly to give it directly to private banks in baylands like Cyprus.
[01:27:33.346 --> 01:27:37.909]  So, if you don't like that, we can throw in guillotines for free.
[01:27:37.949 --> 01:27:41.772]  Maybe they'll start chopping our heads off and telling us it's eternal life.
[01:27:42.332 --> 01:27:50.257]  And Obama can have a press conference about that and tell us that down is up and up is down and black is white and left is right and cabler elves are real.
[01:27:50.297 --> 01:27:50.778]  How's that sound?
[01:27:51.118 --> 01:27:51.205]  Yeah.
[01:27:52.421 --> 01:27:53.201]  Oh, it sounds great.
[01:27:53.261 --> 01:28:01.585]  I mean, also with not a lot of Canadians being awake, they don't even know what a bail-in is, let alone that they're planning to do this to us with the... Well, you're right.
[01:28:01.625 --> 01:28:04.786]  Your new budget does announce they're planning to take your bank account money.
[01:28:05.646 --> 01:28:07.007]  And, I mean, why not have a yearly deal?
[01:28:07.027 --> 01:28:08.167]  I mean, it worked in Cyprus.
[01:28:08.587 --> 01:28:11.868]  America puts up with OSCAMA care, abomination care.
[01:28:12.329 --> 01:28:14.069]  Why not take Canadians' bank accounts?
[01:28:14.509 --> 01:28:15.270]  You don't like that?
[01:28:15.650 --> 01:28:17.190]  We'll throw in a SWAT team for free!
[01:28:17.210 --> 01:28:20.832]  You don't like it?
[01:28:22.779 --> 01:28:24.360]  Matt, I appreciate your terrorist call.
[01:28:25.260 --> 01:28:27.161]  I say give everything you've got to the government.
[01:28:28.781 --> 01:28:29.281]  Terrorist.
[01:28:30.002 --> 01:28:31.442]  Let's talk to Justin in Georgia.
[01:28:31.462 --> 01:28:32.062]  You're on the air.
[01:28:32.102 --> 01:28:32.482]  Go ahead.
[01:28:32.503 --> 01:28:36.084]  Go ahead, terrorist.
[01:28:37.964 --> 01:28:50.309]  Yes, I know this is a little bit off topic with the healthcare issue and everything, and probably not that important in the grand scheme of things, but my question was about talk show hosts, and I've noticed there's been a change in
[01:28:51.637 --> 01:28:54.360]  Sean Hannity, he's sounding a little bit more like Alex Jones.
[01:28:56.822 --> 01:29:01.526]  I've also listened occasionally to Michael Medved, and you know who he is.
[01:29:03.128 --> 01:29:05.630]  Yeah, he's a movie review guy, has a tiny audience, yeah I know who he is.
[01:29:06.171 --> 01:29:16.801]  Yeah, but do you think this guy, he was so against Ron Paul, he's trashed your show a lot, and he just seems like he might be working for
[01:29:18.115 --> 01:29:21.378]  Oh, there's no doubt Medved's like a Southern Property Law Center type guy.
[01:29:21.698 --> 01:29:26.243]  Listen, I was at the RNC in 2004 covering it.
[01:29:26.644 --> 01:29:28.485]  Had the passes, you know, all the way down to the floor.
[01:29:29.206 --> 01:29:32.289]  And he saw me and began yelling something like...
[01:29:33.411 --> 01:29:34.612]  Are you saying they blew it up?
[01:29:34.952 --> 01:29:40.157]  Are you saying they- like, like, and then, like, to police, to, like, act like I was saying blow something up.
[01:29:40.697 --> 01:29:42.278]  Are you saying the government blew up the towers?
[01:29:42.298 --> 01:29:49.644]  Are you saying- I mean, he's a smart guy, and I, I kind of jetted out of there, uh, whenever I saw that, I realized that's a really dangerous guy.
[01:29:49.664 --> 01:29:51.926]  Uh, Michael Nedved.
[01:29:52.647 --> 01:29:54.408]  Um, but, I mean, he's not even worth talking about.
[01:29:54.448 --> 01:29:56.010]  His audience is so pathetic and tiny.
[01:29:56.903 --> 01:29:59.887]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:30:00.828 --> 01:30:03.511]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:07.748 --> 01:30:10.829]  Alex Jones here with a very important announcement for truth seekers.
[01:30:11.229 --> 01:30:16.930]  We've carried a lot of amazing films and books over the years on the online video bookstore at Infowars.com.
[01:30:17.170 --> 01:30:23.572]  And out of all the titles we've carried, one stands out because it is just so chillingly convincing.
[01:30:23.752 --> 01:30:29.173]  And that's Dreams from My Real Father by Joel Gilbert, available at Infowars.com.
[01:30:29.453 --> 01:30:33.094]  This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen.
[01:30:33.274 --> 01:30:36.837]  If you want to know who Obama's real daddy is, this is the film for you.
[01:30:37.077 --> 01:30:41.461]  Don't forget, your purchase supports our broadcast and our growing media network.
[01:30:41.681 --> 01:30:44.003]  You'll also find it at infowarshop.com.
[01:30:44.183 --> 01:30:47.727]  None Dare Call a Conspiracy by Gary Allen, the book that woke me up.
[01:30:48.027 --> 01:30:52.310]  We're also carrying Behind the Green Mask, UN Agenda 21, by Rosa Corey.
[01:30:52.471 --> 01:30:55.113]  This book is coffin nails to the globalist takeover.
[01:30:55.413 --> 01:31:01.960]  The Greater Good, the most professional and up-to-date film I've ever seen, exposing the scourge that is vaccines.
[01:31:02.240 --> 01:31:06.965]  These titles and a lot more are all available at InfoWarshop.com.
[01:31:07.585 --> 01:31:12.090]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[01:31:12.270 --> 01:31:20.634]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet, the highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease?
[01:31:20.954 --> 01:31:22.615]  It all comes down to one thing.
[01:31:22.895 --> 01:31:24.196]  We are what we eat.
[01:31:24.536 --> 01:31:28.858]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[01:31:29.199 --> 01:31:33.181]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[01:31:33.421 --> 01:31:35.762]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[01:31:35.982 --> 01:31:41.885]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[01:32:07.955 --> 01:32:14.198]  Strategic relocation is a systematic way to think strategically in the future about how do I safeguard.
[01:32:14.599 --> 01:32:17.000]  Renowned author and expert, Joel Skousen.
[01:32:17.020 --> 01:32:17.380]  The U.S.
[01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:21.562]  isn't building huge underground bases and bunkers because of some terrorist threat.
[01:32:21.662 --> 01:32:24.244]  They know that a massive nuclear attack is coming.
[01:32:24.644 --> 01:32:25.884]  They want that attack to come.
[01:32:26.125 --> 01:32:32.328]  Joel Skousen is renowned as one of the world's foremost experts in strategic relocation and the securing of your home.
[01:32:32.708 --> 01:32:35.172]  What I tell people is that you do have time.
[01:32:35.372 --> 01:32:40.140]  We talk about natural disasters, the health environment, we talk about pollution, the water quality.
[01:32:40.340 --> 01:32:47.772]  My personal experience about being in every one of these states, most people won't even be ready, won't be able to get out of town, because there'll be absolute panic.
[01:32:48.072 --> 01:32:50.635]  There is no preparedness without strategy.
[01:32:50.836 --> 01:32:53.479]  This Christmas, give the gift of preparedness.
[01:32:53.939 --> 01:32:58.184]  Strategic Relocation the Film with Joel Skousen and Alex Jones.

[01:33:23.826 --> 01:33:27.768]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:38.373 --> 01:33:46.337]  I am going to go right back to your phone calls here in just a moment and then back in the huge NSA domestic spy grid breaking news.
[01:33:47.457 --> 01:33:51.179]  Huge news on the open borders front and a lot more today.
[01:33:54.462 --> 01:33:57.965]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 800-259-9231.
[01:33:58.005 --> 01:34:07.053]  But first off, there's a lot of reasons that I created Infowarslife.com and came out with the first of many products.
[01:34:07.073 --> 01:34:09.315]  But you notice we could have already rushed out a lot of products.
[01:34:09.335 --> 01:34:09.996]  We haven't done that.
[01:34:10.796 --> 01:34:17.562]  Because, quite frankly, we go to laboratories that are the most established, the most elite, and where products can cost $10, $15.
[01:34:20.024 --> 01:34:27.868]  A piece, in some cases $20, stuff we're developing, that I could buy for a dollar and a half from the big factory leading competitors.
[01:34:28.309 --> 01:34:28.769]  Bottled.
[01:34:30.470 --> 01:34:34.672]  Like I could buy vitamin D for a dollar and a half bottled, I'm buying it for $10.
[01:34:34.772 --> 01:34:39.395]  The most organic, unbelievable, off-the-chart types.
[01:34:39.815 --> 01:34:44.838]  Whatever I'm going to start taking, whatever we've done research on, neurotically,
[01:34:45.615 --> 01:34:50.017]  For years, and since launching this the last two months, we only have one product out.
[01:34:51.417 --> 01:34:55.078]  That's because that was years of research and months of development and finding the very best.
[01:34:55.478 --> 01:34:57.759]  And we've got five or six other products in the chain.
[01:34:58.319 --> 01:34:59.340]  One is about to be produced.
[01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:05.002]  It took us months to just get this particular ingredient from Tibet.
[01:35:07.703 --> 01:35:09.883]  And normal products like this would sell for $100.
[01:35:11.184 --> 01:35:13.025]  This product that's coming out is going to sell for $35.
[01:35:15.575 --> 01:35:20.456]  Just to give you an idea of how much these ingredients are costing us, in many cases, it's half the cost.
[01:35:20.856 --> 01:35:23.317]  Most supplements, folks, have four or five times the markup.
[01:35:23.657 --> 01:35:25.097]  And I'm not saying that's bad in a free market.
[01:35:25.337 --> 01:35:35.760]  The point is, is that it blows me away that a lot of the people that talk the most about how, you know, they've got such clean, pure, great stuff, it's like literally $2 a bottle, $3 a bottle.
[01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:37.060]  Not us, folks.
[01:35:37.700 --> 01:35:39.541]  We are neurotically researching.
[01:35:39.761 --> 01:35:41.401]  Like, I've got a brand of coffee coming out.
[01:35:43.779 --> 01:35:45.463]  I use coffee, obviously.
[01:35:46.605 --> 01:35:47.327]  Love coffee.
[01:35:47.588 --> 01:35:50.274]  Found a type of coffee that I enjoyed the best that I've been drinking for 15 years.
[01:35:51.598 --> 01:35:53.159]  We had the deal, the contract.
[01:35:53.299 --> 01:35:55.321]  They got scared because they're nationally distributed.
[01:35:55.962 --> 01:36:01.946]  It comes from Chiapas, which is basically like Guatemala, but even better, in South Central Mexico.
[01:36:02.687 --> 01:36:04.648]  It's my favorite coffee, Arabica.
[01:36:05.029 --> 01:36:05.629]  They backed out.
[01:36:06.310 --> 01:36:12.094]  It took me a year to find a connection to the exact same supply that only comes in once a year.
[01:36:12.355 --> 01:36:15.737]  That's the type of coffee I'm putting out when it comes out in a couple weeks.
[01:36:16.798 --> 01:36:20.520]  Multi-years in the works and when it's sold, it's sold.
[01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:21.780]  That's all we could get.
[01:36:23.321 --> 01:36:24.221]  Talk about fair trade.
[01:36:24.261 --> 01:36:27.203]  This is directly from the Chiapas rebels.
[01:36:28.943 --> 01:36:30.064]  You're like, well, they're like commies.
[01:36:30.084 --> 01:36:30.544]  Why would you do that?
[01:36:30.564 --> 01:36:31.664]  They're not even really commies, folks.
[01:36:31.865 --> 01:36:32.645]  Just the only thing they know.
[01:36:32.665 --> 01:36:34.025]  They're fighting the corrupt Mexican government.
[01:36:34.045 --> 01:36:34.386]  Whatever.
[01:36:34.786 --> 01:36:36.547]  The point is, they're actually free market.
[01:36:36.927 --> 01:36:39.848]  The point is, is that that's the type of stuff I bring you.
[01:36:40.448 --> 01:36:41.609]  I'm like, what is this coffee?
[01:36:41.669 --> 01:36:43.429]  Like 15 years ago, my wife was drinking it.
[01:36:43.449 --> 01:36:44.370]  She's my girlfriend.
[01:36:45.575 --> 01:36:47.556]  He started drinking that coffee, tried everything, it's the best.
[01:36:48.377 --> 01:36:50.558]  From my view, we'll see if you like this coffee like I do.
[01:36:50.578 --> 01:36:51.118]  It's not out yet.
[01:36:51.519 --> 01:37:02.925]  The point is, Survival Shield Atomic Nascent Iodine, I mean, I was told by all the medical doctors, scientists, nutritionists, you need iodine, the best is nascent.
[01:37:03.446 --> 01:37:07.188]  I did research, most of the other brands are not really nascent, just iodine stuck in alcohol.
[01:37:07.408 --> 01:37:09.789]  There's some real nascent in alcohol, but it tends to break down.
[01:37:10.970 --> 01:37:11.811]  We have it in the
[01:37:12.941 --> 01:37:23.227]  Organic, glycerin-based, that literally nobody else has, and it is done with a proprietary system of sound waves and electricity that is just unbelievable.
[01:37:23.987 --> 01:37:25.828]  And, ladies and gentlemen, I want to just show you one thing.
[01:37:25.868 --> 01:37:29.330]  It's not just protective thyroid, increased radiation levels, all the rest of the stuff.
[01:37:31.251 --> 01:37:32.552]  Look at this Harvard study.
[01:37:32.572 --> 01:37:34.613]  I want to show folks on document cam with our TV viewers.
[01:37:35.033 --> 01:37:37.535]  Harvard study confirms fluoride reduces children's IQ.
[01:37:39.161 --> 01:37:43.864]  And then it goes into its compounded lesions on the brain if you don't have iodine.
[01:37:44.384 --> 01:37:51.209]  Now, even the garbage iodine the government put in the salt back in the 20s and 30s and 40s increased.
[01:37:52.450 --> 01:37:53.870]  And here's a Business Insider article.
[01:37:54.131 --> 01:37:57.453]  IQs, 15 points a major study shows.
[01:37:57.493 --> 01:37:58.533]  That's Business Insider.
[01:38:00.034 --> 01:38:08.440]  But now they've removed it in the last 30 years and put halogens in the water, like hydrofluorosilic acid, fluoride, other forms of fluoride.
[01:38:09.881 --> 01:38:11.422]  All the rest of the garbage.
[01:38:11.923 --> 01:38:15.586]  That's why, that's the biggest reason people are zombies from my research.
[01:38:16.086 --> 01:38:16.867]  So what do we do?
[01:38:16.967 --> 01:38:25.515]  We bring something to fund our media operation that I believe in, that I've done the research on, that I use, that I've had dramatic brain effects with.
[01:38:25.695 --> 01:38:28.297]  I mean, there's no doubt this is not placebo, plus the studies show it.
[01:38:28.517 --> 01:38:36.304]  The only problem is I'm so crazed already that it's really, it's hard being this sober and this awake.
[01:38:36.364 --> 01:38:37.265]  It's like being on a drug.
[01:38:38.362 --> 01:38:39.402]  Just being awake and alive.
[01:38:39.422 --> 01:38:42.284]  If I take a vacation, it's like I'm on a drug after getting a break.
[01:38:42.304 --> 01:38:42.724]  You know what I mean?
[01:38:42.744 --> 01:38:44.685]  It's like, people take drugs and dumb themselves down.
[01:38:44.785 --> 01:38:45.265]  I know why.
[01:38:45.585 --> 01:38:46.946]  It's hard to be this conscious.
[01:38:47.546 --> 01:38:49.947]  The point is, we've got a bunch of it in now.
[01:38:50.067 --> 01:38:51.467]  It probably won't sell out for a few weeks.
[01:38:51.487 --> 01:38:52.688]  We're trying to get more right now.
[01:38:53.028 --> 01:38:58.931]  But it's so proprietary, they've got one calibrated machine that can make it in the country.
[01:38:59.591 --> 01:39:03.252]  It's Survival Shield Nascent Iodine from Infowarslife.com.
[01:39:03.312 --> 01:39:04.253]  We have it right now.
[01:39:05.148 --> 01:39:05.728]  You can order it.
[01:39:06.269 --> 01:39:07.409]  We've caught up now on shipping.
[01:39:07.429 --> 01:39:07.949]  You can order it.
[01:39:07.969 --> 01:39:09.250]  It ships out in a matter of days.
[01:39:09.830 --> 01:39:17.234]  Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[01:39:17.614 --> 01:39:26.478]  And we've got two different types of Arabica Mexican coffee, high mountain, shade-grown coffee coming out.
[01:39:26.638 --> 01:39:30.360]  One's got the mushrooms infused in it for immune support.
[01:39:30.380 --> 01:39:30.840]  We've got the other.
[01:39:30.860 --> 01:39:32.261]  And it's not going to be here for a few weeks.
[01:39:32.621 --> 01:39:33.722]  It's been hand-roasted.
[01:39:34.733 --> 01:39:41.077]  In Colorado, it's on its way, I think, Friday in the truck to Austin, Texas.
[01:39:41.117 --> 01:39:50.604]  So, you're supporting the people of Mexico with real jobs, not being at the slave factories in Mexico City or up here, and you're getting high-quality roasted in America.
[01:39:50.924 --> 01:39:51.704]  You cannot beat it.
[01:39:51.764 --> 01:39:53.666]  And again, it's not being sold yet.
[01:39:53.686 --> 01:39:54.226]  You know that's coming.
[01:39:54.426 --> 01:39:55.006]  Give you an example.
[01:39:55.267 --> 01:39:56.748]  Two years working on this coffee.
[01:39:57.228 --> 01:39:58.169]  Could have bagged anything.
[01:39:58.209 --> 01:39:58.869]  Could have sold anything.
[01:39:59.149 --> 01:39:59.690]  Two years!
[01:40:00.430 --> 01:40:04.994]  We will sell no wine until it's time as, uh, I guarantee if I sold wine, it's not going to be crud.
[01:40:05.815 --> 01:40:06.836]  And that's what I'm trying to tell you.
[01:40:07.316 --> 01:40:08.457]  But it'll also be a value.
[01:40:08.477 --> 01:40:09.618]  Maybe we should come out with wine.
[01:40:09.919 --> 01:40:10.659]  Jesus did.
[01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:16.925]  The point is, of course, I can't do it like he did, you know, but the point is, Jesus, Jesus, excuse me.
[01:40:17.345 --> 01:40:19.868]  The point is, that's what Michael Jackson called the wine, folks.
[01:40:20.788 --> 01:40:21.729]  I'm being sarcastic.
[01:40:21.789 --> 01:40:26.293]  The point is, Survival Shield, nascent iodine, one-of-a-kind proprietary, Infowarslife.com.
[01:40:27.699 --> 01:40:30.262]  And I'm sorry a lot of the competition is really mad and upset.
[01:40:31.643 --> 01:40:34.045]  Hey, any type of iodine is better than nothing, folks.
[01:40:34.646 --> 01:40:37.429]  Iodine and salt, gourmet salts, Himalayan salt.
[01:40:37.449 --> 01:40:38.630]  If you can't afford this, get that.
[01:40:38.670 --> 01:40:42.013]  It's better than the birth defects, all the stuff, the retardation it's connected to.
[01:40:42.254 --> 01:40:42.774]  Just look it up.
[01:40:43.074 --> 01:40:44.296]  Just get your iodine.
[01:40:44.316 --> 01:40:46.117]  I mean, the government's own studies have meant that.
[01:40:47.198 --> 01:40:51.383]  I believe, from my research, we have the best, and it supports the broadcast in ForrestLife.com.
[01:40:52.469 --> 01:40:52.949]  We're good to go.
[01:41:17.036 --> 01:41:40.341]  The way these are selling it we might have to stop this in two weeks So get your order in now the whole selection discounted the King the Nomad all of it the traveler Info or store.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139 And I had it explained to me our profit is so small on the on the pitchers that have the filters and it was there only like forty fifty four dollars and
[01:41:40.675 --> 01:41:43.837]  The filter ought to cost that much that we actually don't make money on that, but I don't care.
[01:41:43.857 --> 01:41:49.860]  I mean, it's just so free market and so aggressive about absolutely, you know, just, just absolutely giving the lowest price.
[01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:52.441]  Uh, I'm told I think we make $2 on the pitcher.
[01:41:54.402 --> 01:41:57.223]  So anyways, uh, just annihilating the competition.
[01:41:57.243 --> 01:42:00.965]  We've got dash cam systems in lower than all the competition.
[01:42:00.985 --> 01:42:05.007]  Look it up yourself with a free eight gig, uh, memory stick.
[01:42:06.429 --> 01:42:09.992]  The leading competitor is about $130 without the stick, just to give you an idea.
[01:42:10.392 --> 01:42:12.814]  That's the type of super aggressive stuff we're engaged in here.
[01:42:12.834 --> 01:42:13.494]  Okay?
[01:42:14.014 --> 01:42:16.256]  So, InfoWareStore.com.
[01:42:16.296 --> 01:42:20.579]  That's a long plug, mid-air refueling, that's how we fund the whole media operation.
[01:42:21.720 --> 01:42:24.021]  I don't get paid by the radio network, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:42:25.202 --> 01:42:30.066]  I get paid what I originally under contract got paid from Genesis in 1997.
[01:42:33.294 --> 01:42:34.975]  I get paid $2,000 a month.
[01:42:35.516 --> 01:42:36.517]  Never change the deal.
[01:42:37.578 --> 01:42:40.240]  And because I have an advertising deal to have half the advertising.
[01:42:41.081 --> 01:42:42.162]  And so that's what I get paid.
[01:42:42.182 --> 01:42:43.282]  So technically I do get paid.
[01:42:43.302 --> 01:42:46.685]  But I fund an operation that costs $8 million a year now to run.
[01:42:46.906 --> 01:42:47.426]  $8 million a year.
[01:42:48.527 --> 01:42:50.428]  That has the effect of operations that have billions.
[01:42:51.429 --> 01:42:54.953]  Thanks to the grace of God, with your support, selling high quality products.
[01:42:55.713 --> 01:42:57.175]  And so that's the bottom line.
[01:42:57.555 --> 01:42:58.776]  So there's my plug for the day.
[01:42:58.816 --> 01:42:59.877]  Please support our local A.M.
[01:42:59.917 --> 01:43:00.177]  and F.M.
[01:43:00.217 --> 01:43:00.678]  affiliates.
[01:43:01.238 --> 01:43:08.585]  If you're a local business, it is your duty to support the local sponsors or to be a sponsor of the show if you believe in the First Amendment, which is under attack.
[01:43:08.845 --> 01:43:10.426]  You see the IRS persecuting
[01:43:11.147 --> 01:43:14.629]  The Tea Party, gun owners, veterans groups, pro-life groups.
[01:43:15.410 --> 01:43:17.111]  That's because we can beat them.
[01:43:17.471 --> 01:43:18.412]  They're trying to shut us up.
[01:43:19.072 --> 01:43:20.393]  Support alternative media.
[01:43:20.433 --> 01:43:21.513]  Spread the word about it.
[01:43:21.934 --> 01:43:23.515]  Spread the word about our local stations.
[01:43:25.336 --> 01:43:26.957]  Like 1530 in Chicago.
[01:43:27.297 --> 01:43:28.057]  Stations like that.
[01:43:28.097 --> 01:43:30.879]  That is so essential, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:32.760]  We have a chance to turn this around.
[01:43:32.800 --> 01:43:33.721]  Okay, let's go to your calls.
[01:43:33.821 --> 01:43:34.501]  Go to them right now.
[01:43:35.462 --> 01:43:38.724]  Let's go to Adam in North Carolina.
[01:43:38.784 --> 01:43:39.505]  You're on the air, sir.
[01:43:39.525 --> 01:43:40.045]  Thanks for holding.
[01:43:40.731 --> 01:43:44.972]  Hey Alex, this is the first time call for me by the show and what you do.
[01:43:45.853 --> 01:43:56.456]  My first question before I just give you my take on Obamacare was my next door neighbor, he is actually a truck driver and he told me he's also a gun owner and he had mentioned something to me about
[01:43:56.929 --> 01:44:09.633]  Two types of bullets coming out, which one was aluminum and they could go through everything and then these plastic bullets that have microchips in them that they could track when you fired it, where you fired it, where, you know, it's like has all this information.
[01:44:09.673 --> 01:44:14.615]  So if someone stole it from you, you know, if you had this, you could get blamed for something you didn't even do.
[01:44:14.635 --> 01:44:15.775]  Have you ever heard of that?
[01:44:17.563 --> 01:44:43.525]  Yes, they call them safety slugs, the air marshals use them, because it won't shoot to the aircraft, but into somebody's body it absolutely, like I've seen demonstrations, I've done it myself, you should shoot wet phone books that simulate human flesh, they've been soaked for a day in water, and a normal bullet won't even shoot through it, say from a .357 Magnum, but you shoot these, I think the name's Shure, safety slugs,
[01:44:44.266 --> 01:44:47.668]  You shoot it with a shearer's safety slug, it just balloons it out.
[01:44:48.409 --> 01:44:51.711]  And just puts all its energy in, in the first few inches.
[01:44:52.151 --> 01:44:54.993]  And just, just splatters everything.
[01:44:55.013 --> 01:44:57.335]  And they've got a lot of different versions.
[01:44:57.355 --> 01:45:06.401]  They've got sabos, or sabos, depending on how you want to pronounce it, that can have a, uh, different types of composite cores.
[01:45:06.441 --> 01:45:08.762]  Don't have to be metal, or it can be steel or lead.
[01:45:08.782 --> 01:45:13.906]  Uh, and then, uh, you've got a plastic jacket that accelerates it down the barrel of the gun.
[01:45:15.896 --> 01:45:17.637]  Do they have chips in them or RFID chips?
[01:45:19.579 --> 01:45:33.788]  I don't know anything about putting chips in guns to track people but they do chip a lot of weapon systems to track them and they do put a lot of secret chips on weapon systems internally so they can track them by satellite RFID.
[01:45:34.909 --> 01:45:45.176]  Okay my take on the Obamacare thing I mean fortunately I don't have to have that right now I got another year left on my alternative medical care which is basically the lesser of two evils but
[01:45:45.757 --> 01:45:53.642]  I'm hoping that this whole thing implodes with it because even though I try to warn people that I know, like, wait, don't go on to this thing because it's not meant to work.
[01:45:53.682 --> 01:45:57.024]  They're like, oh, well, you know, I'm just going to take my chances.
[01:45:57.465 --> 01:45:58.846]  And, you know, if I'm wrong, I'm wrong.
[01:45:58.926 --> 01:46:02.348]  But they don't understand when you're wrong with something like this, it's going to cost you.
[01:46:02.688 --> 01:46:03.128]  Exactly.
[01:46:03.288 --> 01:46:04.209]  This is how it works.
[01:46:04.629 --> 01:46:05.649]  Obamacare in 60 seconds.
[01:46:05.970 --> 01:46:07.370]  They put the myth out, it's free.
[01:46:07.850 --> 01:46:09.011]  You go here, you sign up.
[01:46:09.291 --> 01:46:12.312]  You go there, all it does is grab your data, give it to the CIA and NSA.
[01:46:12.512 --> 01:46:13.573]  That's now mainstream-ish.
[01:46:14.193 --> 01:46:15.534]  And then it's conduited off.
[01:46:15.934 --> 01:46:20.896]  And then you get into a process now, standing in line going, well, I've already been here so long, what do I do?
[01:46:20.916 --> 01:46:24.758]  Well, you vote for us again, and you'll get your free health care someday.
[01:46:25.498 --> 01:46:28.840]  And then meanwhile, you just get your tax refund confiscated.
[01:46:30.941 --> 01:46:31.221]  Go ahead.
[01:46:32.105 --> 01:46:48.375]  Yeah, well that's why I'm not too anxious to get on that myself and it's like I'm just thinking that why would anybody be stupid enough to actually take this when you clearly see even the mainstream media is starting to cover this now that they're saying don't go on it it's fake you know I mean all the problems that they're having
[01:46:48.775 --> 01:46:58.319]  I mean, with this supposed to be such a high-tech world, that we're supposed to have all of this technology, they try to get us to believe that, oh, it's a computer glitch that's causing all this problem?
[01:46:58.679 --> 01:47:04.361]  I mean, let's wake up... No, they have to make it about the site being broken, because the bill never gave anybody free healthcare.
[01:47:04.662 --> 01:47:07.623]  It doubled, tripled, and quadrupled, and beyond.
[01:47:08.303 --> 01:47:10.344]  So again, we knew this would happen.
[01:47:10.364 --> 01:47:12.366]  We know how their scams run.
[01:47:12.406 --> 01:47:12.946]  God bless you.
[01:47:12.986 --> 01:47:13.546]  Great points.
[01:47:13.806 --> 01:47:16.368]  Let's talk to Dean in California.
[01:47:16.388 --> 01:47:18.830]  I hope you're not an extremist racist.
[01:47:19.410 --> 01:47:21.651]  You better support Obamacare or you're a racist.
[01:47:21.691 --> 01:47:22.392]  Go ahead, racist.
[01:47:23.553 --> 01:47:26.694]  Oh, I'm a trendy and I just support it so much.
[01:47:27.235 --> 01:47:28.115]  That's more like it.
[01:47:28.155 --> 01:47:28.756]  Talk like that.
[01:47:28.816 --> 01:47:29.196]  Go ahead.
[01:47:30.297 --> 01:47:34.579]  I just can't believe you just don't accept Obamacare as just your savior too.
[01:47:36.294 --> 01:47:37.895]  You know, Obama cares about me.
[01:47:37.935 --> 01:47:42.317]  That's why he wants me to take shots and wants 11-year-olds to have abortions without mommy knowing.
[01:47:42.777 --> 01:47:43.758]  I think that's reasonable.
[01:47:44.118 --> 01:47:46.519]  I like MSNBC saying our children belong to the state.
[01:47:47.360 --> 01:47:51.162]  I like 7 of the czars supporting Mao Zedong who killed 85 million people.
[01:47:51.582 --> 01:47:56.204]  I think all the new Head Start programs teaching kids that the state is God and 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[01:47:56.485 --> 01:47:57.785]  I think that's normal.
[01:47:58.085 --> 01:47:59.026]  I think everything's fine.
[01:48:00.069 --> 01:48:01.210]  Oh, that's awesome.
[01:48:01.250 --> 01:48:02.350]  I think that's perfect, too.
[01:48:02.410 --> 01:48:05.232]  Hollywood's all in on it, and I'm behind them all.
[01:48:05.372 --> 01:48:07.813]  I love all the anti-family messages on television.
[01:48:08.313 --> 01:48:09.574]  I think it's for my own good.
[01:48:09.594 --> 01:48:12.196]  They put the fluoride in the water because they care about me.
[01:48:13.416 --> 01:48:14.457]  Oh, yeah.
[01:48:14.497 --> 01:48:16.838]  You know, Alex, I tell everybody about you.
[01:48:16.858 --> 01:48:25.042]  I even have a little sticker on my name badge that says Infowars.com, so people can ask me about, you know, what's that?
[01:48:25.203 --> 01:48:27.664]  I'm like, that's where I get all my information, folks.
[01:48:28.283 --> 01:48:29.945]  I drink Beyond Tangy Tangerine.
[01:48:29.985 --> 01:48:30.986]  Share that with everybody.
[01:48:31.386 --> 01:48:33.208]  I have Survival Shield iodine.
[01:48:33.228 --> 01:48:34.749]  Just been on that for the last three weeks.
[01:48:34.769 --> 01:48:35.530]  It's awesome.
[01:48:36.070 --> 01:48:37.752]  I have a Pro-Pure water filter.
[01:48:37.872 --> 01:48:38.172]  Love it.
[01:48:38.272 --> 01:48:39.133]  I'm a subscriber.
[01:48:39.934 --> 01:48:41.755]  I just think that we're just being undermined.
[01:48:41.796 --> 01:48:46.340]  We've been undermined since at least Woodrow Wilson, the dope, signed us into this whole system.
[01:48:46.420 --> 01:48:49.623]  And then he signed a letter admitting it was a globalist takeover and then they poisoned him.
[01:48:51.736 --> 01:48:53.838]  At least, you know, I admire Woodrow Wilson.
[01:48:53.898 --> 01:48:55.260]  He was an academic, they conned.
[01:48:55.740 --> 01:48:57.182]  He believed in globalism for freedom.
[01:48:57.462 --> 01:49:03.289]  He found out it was a bad deal, and he wrote a letter saying he was going to go public, and they poisoned him that night on the train.
[01:49:03.849 --> 01:49:06.232]  Edward Mandel House was involved.
[01:49:07.293 --> 01:49:07.854]  Unbelievable.
[01:49:08.806 --> 01:49:18.169]  Oh, that guy, Edward Mandelhouse, that Rothschild operative, was the beginning of the undoing of everything that we loved in our country and they pulled it from the water.
[01:49:18.189 --> 01:49:19.069]  Oh my gosh, this is scary!
[01:49:19.109 --> 01:49:20.189]  You know history!
[01:49:20.749 --> 01:49:22.170]  Oh my, that's scary!
[01:49:22.850 --> 01:49:26.091]  A lot of people say that they think you're showing off when you give them history.
[01:49:26.331 --> 01:49:27.511]  No, you're trying to inform them.
[01:49:27.711 --> 01:49:36.354]  But the average trendy, though, they just want to just blissfully hop around with a big handlebar mustache and socks that don't match and tattoos all over them.
[01:49:36.714 --> 01:49:47.298]  And again, I'm not against handlebar mustaches, tattoos all over them, but you'll see like some supermodel with some loser who doesn't even have a job because she thinks she's going to win because the TV said this is what's cool.
[01:49:48.058 --> 01:49:49.200]  It's just like these new shows out nowadays.
[01:50:06.297 --> 01:50:09.879]  The one with all the scientists on it that everybody watches.
[01:50:09.959 --> 01:50:10.479]  I can't remember.
[01:50:10.499 --> 01:50:11.420]  The Big Bang Theory?
[01:50:12.681 --> 01:50:18.244]  I always say that if they ever wrote a real man into that show, he'd steal every one of the girls on there.
[01:50:20.046 --> 01:50:25.870]  Well, I mean, number one, listen, you can see people, trendies, literally trying to live out television.
[01:50:26.370 --> 01:50:27.151]  Like, it's real.
[01:50:27.351 --> 01:50:28.492]  Because, again, like dogs.
[01:50:28.792 --> 01:50:29.913]  Humans are very similar to dogs.
[01:50:29.953 --> 01:50:30.994]  We are social creatures.
[01:50:31.294 --> 01:50:32.395]  We learn off social stuff.
[01:50:32.595 --> 01:50:36.097]  But in a real pack, you would emulate the real alpha that knows how to win.
[01:50:36.558 --> 01:50:43.002]  But they create false alphas on television, and then the males and the females all follow it, and then wonder why they're such losers.
[01:50:43.442 --> 01:50:48.446]  It's designed as a virus, a psychological warfare virus, to make you malfunction.
[01:50:50.720 --> 01:50:54.348]  Along with the vaccines, you know, and all that force trapped that's going to be forced on us.
[01:50:54.388 --> 01:50:57.294]  It's going to just help implode us even that much faster.
[01:50:57.875 --> 01:50:58.456]  Absolutely.
[01:50:58.496 --> 01:51:01.322]  Listen, folks, if you want to be successful, seethe with power.
[01:51:02.409 --> 01:51:02.909]  That's what you do.
[01:51:02.969 --> 01:51:04.629]  Run around the woods at night with your tongue hanging out.
[01:51:04.649 --> 01:51:06.290]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:51:07.130 --> 01:51:07.790]  I did that last night.
[01:51:07.810 --> 01:51:08.730]  Alex Jones here.
[01:51:09.190 --> 01:51:13.031]  And I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show, My Patriot Supply.
[01:51:13.391 --> 01:51:21.873]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[01:51:22.293 --> 01:51:29.554]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow patriots.
[01:51:30.114 --> 01:51:37.518]  My Patriot Supply brings us their exclusive Patriot Pantry brand, along with many other fine preparedness products.
[01:51:38.018 --> 01:51:41.440]  I personally store and use their high-quality products.
[01:51:41.980 --> 01:51:45.602]  It tastes great, and it's easy to store for up to 25 years.
[01:51:46.162 --> 01:51:52.726]  For a limited time, you can save $50 instantly on a four-week supply of food, along with other special offers.
[01:51:53.306 --> 01:52:00.038]  Visit MyPatriotsSupply.com forward slash Alex today with the new world order making rapid advances on every front.
[01:52:00.519 --> 01:52:04.565]  It is essential to prepare with My Patriots Supply today.
[01:52:07.765 --> 01:52:20.889]  With over 3,000 years of historic use, PureSilver continues to be one of nature's most reliable and effective agents against fighting viruses, mold, fungus, bacteria, pathogens and parasites.
[01:52:21.529 --> 01:52:31.812]  At Silverlungs, we have developed a reliable and easy-to-use full production system for creating endless PureNanoSilver solutions right from the convenience and comfort of your home.
[01:52:32.472 --> 01:52:36.715]  Your self-produced nano-silver solutions can be applied topically to the skin.
[01:52:37.116 --> 01:52:47.083]  For many who are new to silver, that wish to try silver for the first time, we offer a full line of consumables and cosmetics, such as our 2-ounce nano-silver nasal sprays.
[01:52:47.523 --> 01:52:48.164]  I think so.
[01:53:06.852 --> 01:53:10.935]  When you need it the most, will your generator, power equipment, or vehicle be ready?
[01:53:11.095 --> 01:53:18.340]  Gas and diesel fuels go bad quickly when stored, and more than half of generator failures during disasters occur as a result of expired fuel.
[01:53:18.500 --> 01:53:22.483]  PRI Fuel Stabilizers keep your fuel fresh for when you need it most.
[01:53:22.603 --> 01:53:28.527]  Nuclear power stations, emergency service providers, and ships at sea rely on PRI Fuel Stabilizers.
[01:53:28.667 --> 01:53:29.407]  And you can too!
[01:53:29.427 --> 01:53:31.308]  Call 888-776-9373 or visit priproducts.com to find the dealer nearest you.
[01:53:37.913 --> 01:53:45.519]  That's the sound of a .44 Magnum and TraumaMaxx, a high-tech hybrid Kevlar bulletproof vest from InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[01:53:45.639 --> 01:53:47.940]  We'll stop it and most pistol rounds.
[01:53:48.140 --> 01:53:54.745]  TraumaMaxx is a major breakthrough in pistol-rated body armor and prices start at just $170 per insert.
[01:53:54.966 --> 01:53:59.969]  More protection, more stopping power, more mobility, and it weighs less than 5 pounds.
[01:54:00.209 --> 01:54:02.671]  Get details at InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[01:54:02.851 --> 01:54:06.014]  That's I-N-F-I-D-E-L-BodyArmor.com.
[01:54:19.943 --> 01:54:35.251]  I remember about 14 years ago seeing a Pentagon paper that was on the MIT website where they were going to have drones that fly around and face scan you and then kill you if you're on the kill list in America.
[01:54:36.872 --> 01:54:39.214]  But they also have them with tear gas and knockout gas.
[01:54:39.234 --> 01:54:40.955]  This is CBS Pittsburgh.
[01:54:41.415 --> 01:54:45.617]  CMU facial recognition technology could be future of catching criminals.
[01:54:45.918 --> 01:54:46.198]  How about
[01:54:47.168 --> 01:54:52.096]  We send these drones to the White House, and it goes on to say it's mounted in drones to fly around the city.
[01:54:52.967 --> 01:54:57.229]  Yeah, and there in Pittsburgh, actually, we won a lawsuit against him from one of our reporters.
[01:54:57.830 --> 01:54:58.910]  Stuart Rhodes was our lawyer.
[01:54:59.550 --> 01:55:00.491]  He's a constitutional lawyer.
[01:55:00.511 --> 01:55:02.252]  They arrested Du with the mainstream media.
[01:55:02.512 --> 01:55:05.774]  They go, oh, you're not mainstream, but you're up on the hill videotaping us beat people?
[01:55:06.014 --> 01:55:06.854]  We're going to arrest you.
[01:55:07.254 --> 01:55:19.181]  And they took him to a torture center where they strapped everyone out in the rain for about eight hours and then screamed and yelled at him and did other things I won't mention on air because people don't want these humiliating things heard on air.
[01:55:21.468 --> 01:55:23.289]  Oh yeah, sometimes you get abused and didn't have to do it.
[01:55:23.329 --> 01:55:24.830]  Happened to others we know.
[01:55:25.310 --> 01:55:26.330]  You don't want it talked about.
[01:55:29.532 --> 01:55:30.212]  That's America.
[01:55:32.093 --> 01:55:33.774]  So, you need to understand what really goes on.
[01:55:33.794 --> 01:55:34.734]  They had the army in there.
[01:55:35.574 --> 01:55:37.835]  Bunch of guys that probably run places like Abu Ghraib.
[01:55:38.176 --> 01:55:39.136]  They had them at an army base.
[01:55:39.856 --> 01:55:40.937]  That's what goes on in America.
[01:55:41.097 --> 01:55:41.877]  They train 24-7 to take us on.
[01:55:43.792 --> 01:55:46.254]  While naming the veterans as the new terrorist.
[01:55:46.774 --> 01:55:47.855]  By the way, here it is.
[01:55:47.975 --> 01:55:56.722]  Obama claims enforcement discretion in his latest speech, if you can call it that, in the latest spillage of lies, to make Obamacare changes.
[01:55:56.882 --> 01:55:57.763]  That's the Washington Times.
[01:55:58.243 --> 01:56:03.528]  And then the Weekly Standard has Howard Dean saying, quote, I wonder if Obama has the legal authority to do this.
[01:56:04.491 --> 01:56:07.652]  No, he doesn't, but it's all a giant scam.
[01:56:07.692 --> 01:56:11.574]  They'll let a few people have their plan with the insurance company.
[01:56:11.974 --> 01:56:13.755]  It's the lottery ticket phenomenon.
[01:56:14.875 --> 01:56:17.617]  So folks believe that, oh, you can get your old plan back.
[01:56:17.657 --> 01:56:19.157]  You understand how that works?
[01:56:19.217 --> 01:56:19.738]  Okay, good.
[01:56:20.438 --> 01:56:22.099]  Remember, we told you what would happen before it happened.
[01:56:23.159 --> 01:56:25.200]  I'm trying to explain to people, we're not winging this.
[01:56:26.340 --> 01:56:29.002]  We know exactly the enemy attack profile, okay?
[01:56:30.362 --> 01:56:31.983]  It's very, very simple what's going on.
[01:56:33.035 --> 01:56:35.758]  It'd be like a bunch of wasps were swarming around your front door.
[01:56:35.778 --> 01:56:38.802]  And we said, hey, you might not want to go under those.
[01:56:38.842 --> 01:56:39.723]  You want to kill those.
[01:56:40.064 --> 01:56:41.105]  They might sting you.
[01:56:41.786 --> 01:56:43.488]  And my mother was actually hornets once.
[01:56:44.069 --> 01:56:44.670]  I'd already moved out.
[01:56:44.690 --> 01:56:44.970]  I was like 19.
[01:56:45.110 --> 01:56:46.191]  I went over to their house.
[01:56:46.211 --> 01:56:50.016]  There were these big, green, yellow hornets right above the door, and a hole above the door.
[01:56:50.717 --> 01:56:54.800]  They'd gotten into the bricks, and I said, Mom, you gotta kill those.
[01:56:55.361 --> 01:56:56.622]  They're going to sting you.
[01:56:56.742 --> 01:56:58.444]  Hornets are really mean when you're slamming the door.
[01:56:58.724 --> 01:57:00.926]  Those things just chased me the other day when I came over to visit.
[01:57:01.606 --> 01:57:04.028]  She said, I don't like to kill things, Alex.
[01:57:04.569 --> 01:57:07.031]  They're mine, and you're not going to kill them.
[01:57:07.051 --> 01:57:07.991]  This is an exact quote.
[01:57:08.717 --> 01:57:10.218]  My dad has a beehive he won't let me kill.
[01:57:10.478 --> 01:57:11.498]  And I like bees, man.
[01:57:11.518 --> 01:57:13.019]  This is another house they have now.
[01:57:13.279 --> 01:57:15.159]  And these stinking bees are out by their hot tub.
[01:57:15.179 --> 01:57:17.160]  I won't even bring my kids over there half the time with those bees.
[01:57:17.540 --> 01:57:18.481]  Because they're aggressive.
[01:57:19.381 --> 01:57:23.002]  They even had a bee scientist out from UT when I was demanding they be killed a few years ago.
[01:57:23.022 --> 01:57:27.504]  And he's like, well these are actually an ancient Middle Eastern variety that someone brought over here and very rare.
[01:57:27.824 --> 01:57:29.485]  They are aggressive but not Africanized.
[01:57:29.525 --> 01:57:31.806]  You can't kill them and we'll remove them if you want.
[01:57:32.566 --> 01:57:34.607]  My parents are out of town, I ought to go over there and kill those things right now.
[01:57:34.987 --> 01:57:37.188]  They just stung me a few months ago, twice in one day.
[01:57:37.669 --> 01:57:38.929]  Rob Doo got stung by them!
[01:57:40.230 --> 01:57:45.332]  He came over after we took the kids whitewater rafting, we went over there to get the hot tub, stinking bees attacked him!
[01:57:46.113 --> 01:57:54.237]  Anyways, my mother, my mother, got stung right between the eyes by the hornet and couldn't see for a couple days when her eyes were all shut.
[01:57:54.577 --> 01:57:58.919]  Needless to say, my dad went and got that wasp spray that shoots 12 feet and they were dead.
[01:57:59.519 --> 01:58:00.900]  He went to the store that day.
[01:58:02.708 --> 01:58:04.528]  Of course, they don't sting my dad and my mother.
[01:58:04.608 --> 01:58:06.269]  It's like the bees know who they are.
[01:58:07.789 --> 01:58:08.309]  And you know what?
[01:58:08.649 --> 01:58:09.609]  I told him when he left town.
[01:58:09.649 --> 01:58:10.109]  They're out of town.
[01:58:10.129 --> 01:58:11.170]  I think I'm going to go over there today.
[01:58:11.710 --> 01:58:15.110]  Run over to the hive with like a can of flea bomb or something.
[01:58:15.390 --> 01:58:17.031]  Hit the button and cram it in the hole.
[01:58:18.171 --> 01:58:19.951]  I don't like killing bugs either, man.
[01:58:20.251 --> 01:58:24.432]  But I have been attacked by these things for 15 years they've lived in that house.
[01:58:24.832 --> 01:58:26.432]  I've probably been stung eight, nine times.
[01:58:27.032 --> 01:58:27.952]  Rob Doo was attacked.
[01:58:27.972 --> 01:58:28.813]  They were in his hair.
[01:58:29.253 --> 01:58:30.673]  Like in a cartoon, they chased him.
[01:58:32.182 --> 01:58:35.065]  And we're like, and they live on four acres in the middle of town.
[01:58:35.085 --> 01:58:35.866]  It's a great place.
[01:58:36.466 --> 01:58:40.810]  But I mean, you know, there's also a lamp post with a microphone in it.
[01:58:40.830 --> 01:58:41.531]  The government just put it in.
[01:58:41.551 --> 01:58:42.131]  I need to go over there.
[01:58:42.512 --> 01:58:47.497]  There's a lot of work to do at my parents' house while they're out of town.
[01:58:48.177 --> 01:58:49.238]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:49.338 --> 01:58:52.541]  Take a few calls when we come back.

[01:58:57.375 --> 01:59:02.982]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[01:59:03.183 --> 01:59:10.412]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[01:59:10.572 --> 01:59:13.796]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[01:59:13.836 --> 01:59:15.699]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[01:59:15.939 --> 01:59:20.502]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[01:59:20.602 --> 01:59:23.364]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[01:59:23.524 --> 01:59:29.288]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[01:59:29.468 --> 01:59:32.950]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[01:59:33.150 --> 01:59:38.194]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine.
[01:59:38.394 --> 01:59:41.376]  Exclusively available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:59:41.616 --> 01:59:47.500]  Nascent Iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.
[01:59:47.600 --> 01:59:49.621]  Survival Shield Nascent Iodine.

[01:59:56.746 --> 02:00:02.450]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:02.870 --> 02:00:05.672]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:12.233 --> 02:00:16.395]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:17.076 --> 02:00:17.876]  You want answers?
[02:00:18.657 --> 02:00:19.537]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:20.197 --> 02:00:23.839]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:24.400 --> 02:00:28.462]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:39.318 --> 02:00:42.499]  Well, there's the pro-gun sheriff we've had on the broadcast before.
[02:00:42.519 --> 02:00:44.440]  Forget his name, we're pulling it up right now.
[02:00:44.460 --> 02:00:46.281]  Chikari's interviewing him, I'm interviewing him.
[02:00:46.301 --> 02:00:48.861]  Children's Hospital on lockdown after reports of shooting.
[02:00:49.982 --> 02:00:50.982]  Uh, let's hear what he has to say.
[02:00:51.002 --> 02:00:52.803]  Let's fade that up real quick, then go back to calls.
[02:00:54.008 --> 02:00:56.889]  And then we will come back in studio with our guest.
[02:00:56.909 --> 02:01:00.171]  Police officers were here conducting a warrant.
[02:01:00.191 --> 02:01:01.371]  David Clark's his name.
[02:01:01.411 --> 02:01:08.134]  They got information the guy was wanted on a warrant, a felon in possession of a firearm, that he was here at the hospital.
[02:01:09.054 --> 02:01:14.957]  They proceeded to the neonatal progressive care unit on the seventh floor of Children's Hospital.
[02:01:15.037 --> 02:01:16.938]  It's where children who
[02:01:18.538 --> 02:01:22.280]  Sick and infants that need extreme care are taken care of.
[02:01:23.300 --> 02:01:29.103]  The officers identified the individual who was holding his baby or holding a baby at the time.
[02:01:30.023 --> 02:01:30.964]  A baby at the time.
[02:01:32.064 --> 02:01:35.005]  They informed him after identifying he was under arrest.
[02:01:35.045 --> 02:01:40.067]  He put the baby down and appeared to want to cooperate in being taken into custody.
[02:01:40.308 --> 02:01:44.589]  He then fled down the hallway and while fleeing produced a handgun and
[02:01:46.150 --> 02:01:47.490]  The officers were in pursuit.
[02:01:47.910 --> 02:01:51.071]  He turned around several times with that handgun in his hand.
[02:01:51.991 --> 02:01:58.992]  And the officers fired several shots, striking the suspect.
[02:01:59.572 --> 02:02:03.753]  The suspect is being treated at Freighter right now as we speak.
[02:02:03.853 --> 02:02:04.353]  Okay, good.
[02:02:04.393 --> 02:02:05.713]  Nobody hurt but the suspect.
[02:02:05.834 --> 02:02:06.294]  Alright, good.
[02:02:06.314 --> 02:02:06.574]  There you go.
[02:02:06.594 --> 02:02:07.234]  That's enough of that.
[02:02:07.414 --> 02:02:12.015]  Notice they can just immediately come out and tell you what's going on instead of hiding everything that's going on for 10 days.
[02:02:12.715 --> 02:02:13.875]  Like if it was a staged event.
[02:02:14.697 --> 02:02:15.858]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[02:02:15.898 --> 02:02:17.100]  Let's talk to Paul.
[02:02:17.940 --> 02:02:18.941]  Paul in Florida.
[02:02:18.961 --> 02:02:19.542]  You're on the air.
[02:02:19.582 --> 02:02:19.882]  Welcome.
[02:02:21.364 --> 02:02:21.944]  Hey Alex.
[02:02:22.024 --> 02:02:22.705]  How are you today?
[02:02:22.845 --> 02:02:23.626]  I'm doing all right, brother.
[02:02:23.646 --> 02:02:24.446]  What's on your mind today?
[02:02:25.648 --> 02:02:26.248]  Great show.
[02:02:27.629 --> 02:02:33.435]  Really wanted to commend you for being the canary in the coal mine, as Mad Cow put it today.
[02:02:34.153 --> 02:02:40.897]  Are you feeling better or exonerated knowing that everything you said has come to fruition?
[02:02:41.097 --> 02:02:43.839]  No, not really, because I wish I would have been proven wrong.
[02:02:44.099 --> 02:02:47.041]  And now it's even worse than I thought it could be, quite frankly.
[02:02:47.061 --> 02:02:49.622]  And it just gets more crazy by the minute.
[02:02:49.682 --> 02:02:53.285]  But I do feel good that people are finally understanding we're in trouble.
[02:02:54.773 --> 02:03:03.337]  And so, people need to realize though, it's not just up to Alex Jones or whoever else is out there, it's up to all of us to resist tyranny wherever we see it.
[02:03:03.377 --> 02:03:07.359]  But thank you for your kind words, brother, but I'm just trying to survive here, so please don't commend me.
[02:03:11.220 --> 02:03:13.501]  I wanted to ask you another question if you have the time.
[02:03:13.521 --> 02:03:16.903]  What do you think is going to come down this hole?
[02:03:16.983 --> 02:03:19.524]  What do you think is going to happen maybe before 2016?
[02:03:25.553 --> 02:03:27.435]  Well, that depends on what we do to stop this.
[02:03:27.455 --> 02:03:36.983]  We either totally discredit the system and stop complying with everything we can and just point out that it's an alien criminal globalist operation.
[02:03:38.260 --> 02:03:44.462]  Or they're going to be able to carry out their plans to shut off the economy, to enslave us and collapse us under government and corporate control.
[02:03:44.982 --> 02:03:46.062]  So we're under attack.
[02:03:46.162 --> 02:03:46.843]  It is a war.
[02:03:47.843 --> 02:03:49.904]  Words cannot describe how big a war it is.
[02:03:49.924 --> 02:03:53.165]  It's a silent, sneaking, cold war against freedom.
[02:03:54.425 --> 02:03:57.146]  And it uses all our institutions against us.
[02:03:57.166 --> 02:03:59.026]  The institutions themselves aren't even bad.
[02:03:59.046 --> 02:04:00.647]  They're just commandeered.
[02:04:01.693 --> 02:04:03.494]  Like an army tank by itself is not bad.
[02:04:03.514 --> 02:04:04.875]  It can be used by good people or bad people.
[02:04:05.255 --> 02:04:10.057]  Our government has been seized and then grown into a giant behemoth.
[02:04:11.698 --> 02:04:13.959]  And we deserve it though.
[02:04:14.019 --> 02:04:16.680]  Not my listeners or myself so much, but none of us are perfect.
[02:04:17.141 --> 02:04:24.544]  But the culture got very decadent off what our forebearers and the greatest generation and folks built for us.
[02:04:27.079 --> 02:04:28.082]  They were a great generation.
[02:04:28.102 --> 02:04:33.277]  I don't think they were as great as the 1776ers and some of the other folks, but you know, they came back and demanded civil rights.
[02:04:34.249 --> 02:04:38.890]  Mainly, mainly veterans, white combat veterans came back particularly and said, we're not going to be part of this.
[02:04:39.690 --> 02:04:43.651]  There were stage brush rebellions all over the country and people said we're going to have freedom.
[02:04:44.671 --> 02:04:46.972]  And Kennedy said we're going to have freedom and they blew his head off.
[02:04:47.672 --> 02:04:52.313]  So that's what it comes down to, is there's corrupt elements that want to continue all this.
[02:04:52.373 --> 02:04:56.914]  But if we don't stop them, they're going to stage false flags and bring in total tyranny.
[02:04:57.234 --> 02:04:59.855]  We have a very interesting guest in studio coming up.
[02:05:00.615 --> 02:05:05.389]  Combat veteran gives his take on 9-11, the Second Amendment, and so much more.
[02:05:07.466 --> 02:05:09.107]  Introducing Pro-1.
[02:05:09.367 --> 02:05:12.869]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[02:05:13.009 --> 02:05:17.411]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[02:05:17.571 --> 02:05:23.534]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[02:05:23.654 --> 02:05:34.440]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.
[02:05:34.640 --> 02:05:40.943]  It is the only one that does it, and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[02:05:41.144 --> 02:05:58.132]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands, and sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[02:05:58.453 --> 02:06:02.835]  Get your Pro-Pure with the new Pro-1 filter today at infowarestore.com.
[02:06:03.035 --> 02:06:03.275]  We're good.
[02:06:22.546 --> 02:06:32.190]  ...are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[02:06:32.450 --> 02:06:38.432]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there, and discovered Longevity.
[02:06:38.632 --> 02:06:46.476]  The Longevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[02:06:46.776 --> 02:06:49.877]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months.
[02:06:50.297 --> 02:06:53.039]  Simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[02:06:53.079 --> 02:06:54.140]  Check it out for yourself.
[02:06:54.380 --> 02:06:55.101]  It's incredible.

[02:07:04.448 --> 02:07:06.289]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[02:07:07.665 --> 02:07:12.767]  Alex Jones here, and I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show, My Patriot Supply.
[02:07:13.147 --> 02:07:21.609]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[02:07:22.029 --> 02:07:29.332]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow Patriots.
[02:07:29.852 --> 02:07:37.254]  My Patriot Supply brings us their exclusive Patriot Pantry brand, along with many other fine preparedness products.
[02:07:37.754 --> 02:07:41.156]  I personally store and use their high-quality products.
[02:07:41.716 --> 02:07:45.339]  It tastes great, and it's easy to store for up to 25 years.
[02:07:45.899 --> 02:07:52.483]  For a limited time, you can save $50 instantly on a four-week supply of food, along with other special offers.
[02:07:53.043 --> 02:07:59.787]  Visit mypatriotsupply.com forward slash Alex today, with the New World Order making rapid advances on every front.
[02:08:00.247 --> 02:08:04.310]  It is essential to prepare with My Patriot Supply today.
[02:08:08.860 --> 02:08:10.320]  We are on the march.
[02:08:10.660 --> 02:08:13.181]  The Empire is on the run.
[02:08:13.801 --> 02:08:17.982]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:18.522 --> 02:08:37.305]  I'm waiting in my cold cell When the bell begins to chime Reflecting on my past life Ladies and gentlemen
[02:08:39.236 --> 02:08:41.477]  Out Out Brief Candle is what William Shakespeare wrote.
[02:08:41.517 --> 02:08:42.578]  That's what life is like.
[02:08:45.199 --> 02:08:47.221]  It goes by like dusk till dawn.
[02:08:48.561 --> 02:08:53.904]  What matters is doing the right thing while you're alive on this planet and building a better world for future generations.
[02:08:54.424 --> 02:08:56.806]  That is not even service, that is fulfillment.
[02:08:58.127 --> 02:09:00.228]  And it is in service to humanity.
[02:09:01.431 --> 02:09:02.573]  No service is perfect.
[02:09:02.653 --> 02:09:04.015]  No cause is perfect.
[02:09:04.515 --> 02:09:13.548]  But in the final equation, it's having a heart that tries to do the right thing, that stands for justice, is what in the final equation will be judged by the creator of the universe.
[02:09:15.669 --> 02:09:18.131]  And your calls will come up at the bottom of the hour for those that are holding.
[02:09:18.151 --> 02:09:22.413]  I've got some other news on the NSA surveillance grid, you name it.
[02:09:22.814 --> 02:09:25.175]  Our guest will be riding shotgun with us throughout the hour.
[02:09:25.195 --> 02:09:39.344]  We're going to talk about his story exclusively until the bottom of the hour, but then he'll be with us for the rest of the hour and hopefully do an interview for expanded coverage on the InfoWars Nightly News coming up at 7 o'clock central tonight.
[02:09:41.036 --> 02:09:57.758]  But I, a few weeks ago, two and a half weeks ago, was down in San Antonio for the open carry rally, which under state law you can have rifles openly anywhere in public spaces in Texas, but the police chief said I'll arrest you if you do that.
[02:09:59.155 --> 02:10:03.137]  So this is the real cutting edge of the civil rights, human rights, God-given rights movement.
[02:10:03.817 --> 02:10:12.321]  And so we went down there, over a thousand people showed up with the Open Carry Texas and other groups, and I gave a speech with an M4 strapped on my back.
[02:10:13.902 --> 02:10:17.563]  And we weren't sure even when we went there whether they were going to arrest us or not, but they backed off.
[02:10:18.724 --> 02:10:23.126]  The next day they started arresting people that legally had guns, but now lawsuits have already been filed.
[02:10:23.266 --> 02:10:27.208]  So that's what all of this is really about.
[02:10:28.268 --> 02:10:35.713]  And it was the first rally since the Alamo happened in 1836, because it was a warehouse until the 50s when they made it a historical site.
[02:10:36.153 --> 02:10:42.137]  And there's never been a rally allowed there, and it's fitting it was a Second Amendment rally, because the Alamo was about people coming to take the guns.
[02:10:42.177 --> 02:10:43.537]  That's what started the Texas Revolution.
[02:10:43.798 --> 02:10:47.840]  Just like the revolution against King George, the third started when they came to take the guns.
[02:10:48.681 --> 02:10:50.882]  Hollywood tries to make it a racial issue or all this other stuff.
[02:10:50.922 --> 02:10:51.803]  No, it was about guns.
[02:10:52.143 --> 02:10:52.903]  That was the heart of it.
[02:10:53.043 --> 02:10:53.444]  Period.
[02:10:53.764 --> 02:10:55.225]  Ed Gonzalez, they came to take the guns.
[02:10:55.545 --> 02:10:56.325]  That's how it all started.
[02:10:56.505 --> 02:10:56.786]  Period.
[02:10:57.665 --> 02:11:01.006]  That's the main, that's like 80% of it, and I've studied the history big time.
[02:11:01.487 --> 02:11:08.029]  I had family involved on both sides of my family, my mother and father's sides, involved in that historical situation.
[02:11:08.329 --> 02:11:09.030]  So I'm there.
[02:11:10.211 --> 02:11:38.227]  And I talked to hundreds of people while I was there, but I was really touched by speaking with and hearing the things that Army veteran Mario Lopez had to say to me, and he was a combat, Army combat engineering unit in Iraq and then Afghanistan, and his second term was in an IED explosion, and then he gave me his card and I went and looked at his paintings online, and
[02:11:41.259 --> 02:11:58.747]  Really an amazing artist, and the work he's done is very touching and very poignant, and also very archetypal and powerful at the same time, especially the combat art, the art that gets into what soldiers go through, soldiers that are wounded, soldiers that are missing a piece of the puzzle as he basically paints it.
[02:11:59.187 --> 02:12:01.268]  And then I talked about it, and I said, hey, did you sell out when I talked about it?
[02:12:01.288 --> 02:12:04.529]  He said, well, I sell out all the time anyways, because it's such good art.
[02:12:05.110 --> 02:12:08.111]  And I think it's really a testament to all that he's gone through.
[02:12:08.491 --> 02:12:09.792]  So many people, my dad,
[02:12:10.512 --> 02:12:12.015]  You know, would complain about stuff when he was a kid.
[02:12:12.035 --> 02:12:16.645]  Because they were upper middle class, but they would send him to work on local farmer's fields.
[02:12:16.685 --> 02:12:19.050]  They would send him to go help carpenters when he was 10 years old.
[02:12:19.931 --> 02:12:20.753]  So he wouldn't be lazy.
[02:12:21.664 --> 02:12:26.529]  When he complained about it and he'd say, hey, I complained I had no shoes until I saw a man who had no feet.
[02:12:27.790 --> 02:12:42.566]  And that's really what it's all about, is that I see people that have gone through adversity and gone through great trials and tribulations many times that it turns out have even discovered more of their humanity and are more thankful about life now that they've lost so much.
[02:12:42.666 --> 02:12:44.088]  And I think it really is a decadent
[02:12:46.203 --> 02:12:51.025]  It's a slob-like entitlement in this country that is allowing this nation to collapse.
[02:12:52.246 --> 02:12:57.648]  And so, Army veteran Mario Lopez joins us here in studio.
[02:12:57.708 --> 02:13:00.129]  His website is paintingsbymariolopez.com.
[02:13:00.629 --> 02:13:05.151]  He also has his Christian ministry website howiknow.org.
[02:13:05.831 --> 02:13:09.173]  And I want to invite him back at least once a year on the show to see what he's doing with his art.
[02:13:10.393 --> 02:13:13.234]  And it's good to have him here with us.
[02:13:13.254 --> 02:13:18.595]  We can click on that image of him before his injuries and then we'll talk to him here in studio.
[02:13:18.615 --> 02:13:27.537]  If you're a radio listener, you can go to Infowars.com forward slash show and actually see the interview here with us right now.
[02:13:28.077 --> 02:13:33.138]  But Mario, it's so great to have you in studio and thank you for traveling up here from San Antonio with your lovely wife.
[02:13:33.298 --> 02:13:33.938]  Yes sir, thank you.
[02:13:33.998 --> 02:13:34.518]  It's nice to be here.
[02:13:34.798 --> 02:13:35.238]  Thank you.
[02:13:36.099 --> 02:13:36.799]  You've got the floor.
[02:13:36.819 --> 02:13:48.585]  You said you wanted to talk about your experience in Afghanistan and Iraq first, then get into your art, and then talk about your ministry and obviously what you've been through, how it's changed you mentally, not just physically.
[02:13:49.666 --> 02:13:52.407]  Yeah, Iraq was a good experience.
[02:13:53.548 --> 02:14:03.854]  Actually in Iraq I learned about some of the things, the inconsistencies as far as 9-11 goes and whatnot.
[02:14:05.037 --> 02:14:12.640]  So it helped me to open my mind a little bit and came home for a year and a half, went to Afghanistan.
[02:14:13.761 --> 02:14:17.922]  And we were scheduled to be there for 18 months, but I was just there for four months.
[02:14:18.943 --> 02:14:22.424]  And got hit with an IED, got pinned underneath, got burned.
[02:14:25.171 --> 02:14:27.112]  I had a lot of miracles during that time.
[02:14:29.053 --> 02:14:33.877]  After my injury, I just set God aside and I said, you know what?
[02:14:34.397 --> 02:14:38.079]  These doctors and psychologists, they'll fix me.
[02:14:38.159 --> 02:14:41.421]  So I put God aside and it didn't work out too well for me.
[02:14:44.143 --> 02:14:52.448]  I had experienced some stuff in the supernatural and then I was told it was just PTSD.
[02:14:53.979 --> 02:14:54.059]  It's
[02:15:13.795 --> 02:15:15.156]  You can die or have brain damage.
[02:15:15.716 --> 02:15:29.301]  I had 108 and I crossed over again to the other side and then had an angel help me and then after that I woke up and I said, alright mom, my mom's a minister in San Diego, Texas.
[02:15:31.542 --> 02:15:33.343]  And I told her, alright mom, you're right.
[02:15:33.403 --> 02:15:35.964]  Everything you've been telling my whole life is true.
[02:15:36.884 --> 02:15:38.745]  And so I started
[02:15:39.665 --> 02:16:00.213]  During research of creation science and then I just did a lot of research and then later on I met my wife which is a which was an ex-biology high school teacher and she went to Stanford University and we met and we just debate for three months straight and
[02:16:01.448 --> 02:16:03.972]  And then I finally won the debate.
[02:16:04.112 --> 02:16:10.823]  We're going to talk about that but I want to get back into your experience because I've talked to so many people and I've had my own personal experiences.
[02:16:10.843 --> 02:16:13.627]  I'm not going to talk about those because the media would make a big issue out of it.
[02:16:15.478 --> 02:16:15.979]  There is.
[02:16:16.239 --> 02:16:18.622]  We see such a small spectrum of the universe.
[02:16:19.003 --> 02:16:19.784]  Science has proven that.
[02:16:19.804 --> 02:16:20.084]  Right.
[02:16:20.104 --> 02:16:22.628]  There's all these dimensions, all this other dark matter, you name it.
[02:16:23.068 --> 02:16:29.217]  But in every culture, people that only believe in angels and God, atheists, you name it, for thousands of years they have the same experience.
[02:16:29.577 --> 02:16:30.158]  Right.
[02:16:30.178 --> 02:16:32.621]  And I've talked to so many people like Colonel
[02:16:33.942 --> 02:16:37.665]  Craig Roberts and others who died for ten minutes, totally dead for five.
[02:16:38.146 --> 02:16:39.106]  You know, just brain dead.
[02:16:39.707 --> 02:16:42.929]  And literally went up the angels, guardian angels, whole life, the portal.
[02:16:43.209 --> 02:16:44.090]  You're being sent back.
[02:16:44.190 --> 02:16:45.031]  Doctors couldn't believe it.
[02:16:45.451 --> 02:16:48.573]  He's alive 16, 17 years later after that cancer.
[02:16:48.634 --> 02:16:49.454]  It's about 20 years.
[02:16:50.315 --> 02:16:57.000]  And he was a Marine, then Army, and then police officer, SWAT team commander, helicopter pilot, survived all this stuff.
[02:16:57.500 --> 02:17:00.583]  But so many other people, they talk about that experience.
[02:17:01.503 --> 02:17:04.085]  And for folks that have never had these experiences, I feel sorry for them.
[02:17:04.105 --> 02:17:13.691]  You know, they say that people that have died before or gotten very close, that's actually almost a gift because you get a lot of enlightenment when that's happened.
[02:17:14.171 --> 02:17:16.013]  Yeah, there's no atheist in a foxhole.
[02:17:17.414 --> 02:17:18.574]  No.
[02:17:18.594 --> 02:17:22.637]  Well, tell us about, just people that don't know the face of real war, tell us about the IED.
[02:17:22.677 --> 02:17:24.018]  We're going to skip this network break.
[02:17:25.237 --> 02:17:26.058]  I don't know.
[02:17:46.659 --> 02:17:48.740]  I just saw gray everywhere.
[02:17:48.760 --> 02:17:53.784]  I knocked out for a couple seconds and then I woke up and I saw and smelled flames.
[02:17:54.784 --> 02:18:01.489]  And I just looked up and I was like, all right, Lord, I'm coming to meet you.
[02:18:01.649 --> 02:18:04.971]  And I had nine, two or three rounds strapped to my chest.
[02:18:05.491 --> 02:18:15.798]  And two or three rounds for people that don't know what that is, it's like a golf ball sized shotgun shell, but it has a grenade on the end of it instead of a slug.
[02:18:16.605 --> 02:18:17.505]  And I had nine of them.
[02:18:17.525 --> 02:18:18.106]  They didn't go off.
[02:18:18.446 --> 02:18:20.067]  And my weapon was completely destroyed.
[02:18:20.647 --> 02:18:21.927]  Non-functioning, you know.
[02:18:22.227 --> 02:18:23.968]  As you can tell, I was burned pretty bad.
[02:18:24.768 --> 02:18:26.889]  And so, that was one of my first miracles.
[02:18:26.909 --> 02:18:27.870]  And you lost your arm?
[02:18:27.910 --> 02:18:29.010]  I lost my arm.
[02:18:29.030 --> 02:18:34.212]  They had to pull me out of the flames to save my life.
[02:18:34.232 --> 02:18:36.033]  So they had to cut your arm off to get you out?
[02:18:36.413 --> 02:18:39.715]  Well, they pulled me out and it was just...
[02:18:41.508 --> 02:18:41.869]  Mangled.
[02:18:41.909 --> 02:18:53.086]  Mangled up pretty bad and uh... and uh... I'd look down and I was like, oh my beautiful arm, you know, because uh... I've heard those descriptions of the guys have to go back in there while it's burning too.
[02:18:53.447 --> 02:18:54.588]  They a lot of times get burned.
[02:18:55.625 --> 02:18:58.586]  Yeah, luckily the guys that pulled me out didn't.
[02:18:58.706 --> 02:19:01.027]  Thank God, in fact the other guys didn't get hurt as bad as you.
[02:19:01.887 --> 02:19:10.709]  No, some of my battle buddies, they have back problems and PTSD and stuff like that.
[02:19:12.610 --> 02:19:15.371]  But no, I was the worst one out because I was pinned down.
[02:19:15.391 --> 02:19:20.072]  Wow, I mean how long were you pinned inside that armored vehicle?
[02:19:22.030 --> 02:19:31.059]  I have no idea because I got knocked out, but I could imagine it was maybe five minutes or so that I can remember.
[02:19:31.079 --> 02:19:32.560]  It was a while.
[02:19:33.401 --> 02:19:33.921]  In the flames?
[02:19:34.042 --> 02:19:34.882]  In the flames, yeah.
[02:19:35.002 --> 02:19:39.006]  So you literally were in, I mean, like in a barbecue pit for five minutes?
[02:19:39.026 --> 02:19:45.232]  Yes, barbecue pit, heard the cracking of the flames and it was just surreal.
[02:19:46.601 --> 02:19:47.362]  It's a real experience.
[02:19:47.542 --> 02:19:52.985]  What's it like for you now when you see, like, yuppies and trendies that are lazy and stupid and people who don't even care about their kids?
[02:19:53.005 --> 02:19:53.686]  They have everything.
[02:19:53.706 --> 02:19:55.387]  They got their arms, their eyes, everything.
[02:19:55.407 --> 02:19:58.909]  And then they just could care less about anybody but themselves.
[02:20:00.826 --> 02:20:07.111]  I think they need to really wake up and see what's happening out there because it's going to affect them too.
[02:20:07.611 --> 02:20:11.093]  They'll be the ones in the trenches.
[02:20:11.754 --> 02:20:13.075]  They'll be the ones hiding.
[02:20:13.095 --> 02:20:18.439]  They'll be like, oh, I can't believe this is happening to us.
[02:20:18.899 --> 02:20:23.962]  Then they'll remember people like you and me telling people the realities.
[02:20:24.123 --> 02:20:25.183]  Let's talk about the angel.
[02:20:25.203 --> 02:20:26.664]  Talk about that near-death experience.
[02:20:32.202 --> 02:20:32.682]  What happened?
[02:20:33.602 --> 02:20:38.464]  Well, uh, I had, um, started bleeding internally after the surgery.
[02:20:38.484 --> 02:20:43.665]  And they were gonna put, uh, uh, this, uh, medical device underneath my skin, underneath my back.
[02:20:45.005 --> 02:20:49.206]  And, um, I started, um, uh, bleeding internally.
[02:20:49.746 --> 02:20:52.447]  And they gave me pints, four pints of blood.
[02:20:53.187 --> 02:20:56.708]  Each pint, uh, they were hoping the bleeding would stop internally.
[02:20:57.608 --> 02:20:59.789]  And, um, it didn't.
[02:21:00.089 --> 02:21:00.869]  I just, uh,
[02:21:02.460 --> 02:21:24.013]  I just kept bleeding and the last pint was a bad batch of blood and so I got a 108 fever and they had to remove the device and when they removed the device and when they moved the bad batch of blood they couldn't use that same needle because it was obviously tainted.
[02:21:24.934 --> 02:21:29.537]  So while I started getting the 108 fever I couldn't get another IV.
[02:21:30.993 --> 02:21:33.635]  So I was just out there on my own, no IV.
[02:21:33.655 --> 02:21:38.179]  You know, they had to put me in ice packs and stuff.
[02:21:38.920 --> 02:21:43.404]  And then about that time I started crossing over to the other side.
[02:21:44.304 --> 02:21:47.307]  And I saw a couple demons.
[02:21:48.648 --> 02:21:52.191]  One was a demon of lust.
[02:21:52.251 --> 02:21:54.013]  She looked like Angelina Jolie.
[02:21:54.033 --> 02:21:56.915]  You know, she was really gorgeous, but she had green skin.
[02:21:58.116 --> 02:22:08.925]  And, uh, she was wearing a black sticky garment and, uh, and, uh, I mean, she didn't say I'm the demon of lust or anything, but I could just put two and two together, you know, that's what she was there for.
[02:22:08.986 --> 02:22:14.891]  And, and, uh, that sticky garment, I associate that with lust is because it's hard to get away from, you know?
[02:22:14.911 --> 02:22:17.333]  So it was like flypaper trying to get you to choose to go to hell.
[02:22:18.285 --> 02:22:19.526]  It was almost a battle right there?
[02:22:19.646 --> 02:22:23.029]  Yeah, yeah, it definitely, uh... Yeah, that happens a lot with people that are right on the edge.
[02:22:23.089 --> 02:22:27.373]  Yeah, uh, there was this, uh, other little... It's like in the Bible, and they fought over Moses' body.
[02:22:27.533 --> 02:22:27.894]  Go ahead.
[02:22:28.214 --> 02:22:29.936]  There's this, uh, classic-looking demon.
[02:22:29.976 --> 02:22:31.037]  He was actually on my bed.
[02:22:31.777 --> 02:22:35.501]  And he had a big nose, he was red, he had just, like, maybe two feet tall, long, uh...
[02:22:37.382 --> 02:22:45.043]  Uh, fingernails and he was just scratching at my, uh, at my spirit trying to separate my, my body from my, my soul from my body.
[02:22:45.063 --> 02:22:46.344]  By the way, I never even heard this story.
[02:22:46.364 --> 02:22:46.564]  Yeah.
[02:22:46.764 --> 02:22:46.884]  Yeah.
[02:22:47.044 --> 02:22:47.504]  Go ahead.
[02:22:47.984 --> 02:22:49.904]  And he was trying to, uh, separate it.
[02:22:50.584 --> 02:22:57.466]  Uh, and, um, and there was this also this, uh, um, like a rock looking demon.
[02:22:57.506 --> 02:23:00.946]  He, uh, I associate him with like a demon of pride cause I had a lot of pride in my life.
[02:23:01.966 --> 02:23:05.327]  And, uh, uh, he looked like the, uh, Fantastic Four.
[02:23:06.650 --> 02:23:06.710]  The
[02:23:22.872 --> 02:23:26.115]  I just was like, oh man, this is happening again.
[02:23:26.135 --> 02:23:28.917]  And I was like, man, I didn't learn my lesson.
[02:23:28.957 --> 02:23:31.239]  They just started laughing at me.
[02:23:31.860 --> 02:23:34.201]  Not with their mouth, but in their mind, they started laughing at me.
[02:23:34.241 --> 02:23:35.302]  Like, you didn't learn anything.
[02:23:35.322 --> 02:23:37.704]  You're going with us to hell tonight.
[02:23:40.326 --> 02:23:50.736]  And this angel, as my mom was there praying beside my bed, and I couldn't move, and I just see her there praying, this angel just came out of the ceiling like a whirlwind.
[02:23:51.536 --> 02:23:57.001]  And as he was coming down, he struck the biggest guy in the room, that rock demon.
[02:23:57.722 --> 02:24:01.425]  And then that's all I remember.
[02:24:01.445 --> 02:24:03.347]  I just remember what he looked like.
[02:24:03.447 --> 02:24:04.808]  He looked like,
[02:24:06.483 --> 02:24:12.007]  Uh, he had blonde hair, blue eyes, and, uh, he was, like, ten feet tall.
[02:24:12.027 --> 02:24:15.549]  And he looked like the biggest, uh, wrestler that I'd ever seen in my whole life.
[02:24:16.349 --> 02:24:18.531]  And, uh, he had, uh, armor on.
[02:24:19.031 --> 02:24:26.176]  And, uh, his armor was silver, uh, glistening silver with- outlined with gold, and he had this sword.
[02:24:26.196 --> 02:24:27.336]  Wow.
[02:24:27.596 --> 02:24:32.039]  And, uh, this- this sword, uh, was pretty- was pretty big.
[02:24:32.139 --> 02:24:32.780]  It had, um,
[02:24:33.959 --> 02:24:34.880]  It had holes in it.
[02:24:35.100 --> 02:24:37.901]  And I don't know anything about swords or that I like guns.
[02:24:37.942 --> 02:24:38.662]  I'm a soldier, you know?
[02:24:39.382 --> 02:24:49.128]  And while I was doing research on swords, I come to find out that swords and knives and stuff like that with holes is to make them lighter.
[02:24:49.148 --> 02:24:51.070]  They're just as strong to make them lighter.
[02:24:51.890 --> 02:24:59.422]  And I was like, wow, you know, like stuff I didn't even know that I, that I learned while I was, you know, dying, you know?
[02:24:59.482 --> 02:25:03.047]  Well, sure, you can get knowledge in these type of things and then actually comes true later.
[02:25:03.308 --> 02:25:03.588]  Yeah.
[02:25:03.708 --> 02:25:05.010]  I mean, it's like interdimensional.
[02:25:05.691 --> 02:25:05.772]  Yeah.
[02:25:07.369 --> 02:25:08.630]  Makes me cry just hearing about it.
[02:25:08.650 --> 02:25:11.953]  It's so amazing that the average person doesn't know what's really going on out there.
[02:25:12.273 --> 02:25:18.558]  Yeah, yeah, they definitely don't see it in the music industry and even in their schools being taught Darwinism.
[02:25:18.578 --> 02:25:26.364]  You know, they just don't see what's really happening and people just need to really wake up and open their eyes and be open-minded.
[02:25:26.404 --> 02:25:27.905]  Well, everything says you're an animal.
[02:25:28.585 --> 02:25:29.946]  You're not made in the image of the Creator.
[02:25:30.167 --> 02:25:30.407]  Right.
[02:25:30.427 --> 02:25:32.688]  Well, that's what they say.
[02:25:32.709 --> 02:25:33.529]  That's not the truth.
[02:25:34.050 --> 02:25:34.490]  Exactly.
[02:25:35.697 --> 02:25:37.679]  Yeah, that's what me and my wife go over.
[02:25:37.699 --> 02:25:51.709]  We go over creation science and just to prove that we are made in the image of God and that, yeah, I don't know.
[02:25:51.949 --> 02:25:53.831]  There's so much information.
[02:25:54.611 --> 02:26:01.337]  What do you make if you've seen all the news where they tell Christians that they can't even be Christians or they give money to a Christian group, they'll be court-martialed?
[02:26:01.357 --> 02:26:02.918]  I mean, that's religious freedom in America.
[02:26:02.938 --> 02:26:04.299]  It's like Soviet Russia.
[02:26:04.815 --> 02:26:10.196]  Yeah, that's just completely taken away from our Constitution.
[02:26:11.777 --> 02:26:12.717]  What are we fighting for?
[02:26:12.737 --> 02:26:14.377]  We're fighting completely for them.
[02:26:14.617 --> 02:26:16.858]  We're supposed to be fighting for this nation.
[02:26:17.438 --> 02:26:28.921]  We held up our right hand and we swore to defend and protect it and it just seems like they're just completely overriding it and I just don't understand.
[02:26:28.941 --> 02:26:30.401]  Why don't we just
[02:26:34.210 --> 02:26:38.433]  I feel sorry for all the people that don't know there's a spiritual battle going on.
[02:26:38.933 --> 02:26:40.134]  I snuck into Bohemian Grove.
[02:26:40.174 --> 02:26:41.515]  I've covered skull and bones.
[02:26:41.615 --> 02:26:44.377]  I grew up in Dallas, Texas and saw amazing stuff going on.
[02:26:45.798 --> 02:26:51.282]  And the elite know there's the occult, and they have been given power over this world because they serve the God of this world.
[02:26:51.882 --> 02:26:55.745]  And it's totally real for them, and they've convinced everyone that none of this is even going on.
[02:26:55.785 --> 02:26:56.646]  It's funny to them.
[02:26:57.106 --> 02:26:58.247]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:26:59.509 --> 02:27:12.803]  On my website, I have a couple of quotes that just come out of my mind sometimes on HowIKnow.com and one of them, I don't know, you can check out Food for Thoughts.
[02:27:15.572 --> 02:27:19.414]  And uh, the very last one, um, I don't know if I can read it.
[02:27:20.234 --> 02:27:32.099]  Uh, tyrannical governments, authoritarian false religions, aliens from outer space, the theory of evolution, immoral living, music, and movies are all different books written by the same author, Satan.
[02:27:33.220 --> 02:27:34.520]  You know, so just.
[02:27:36.533 --> 02:27:40.735]  I'll tell you, out of all the folks I met at the rally, they were all great, but I really just wanted to get you on the show.
[02:27:41.376 --> 02:27:42.977]  And then I saw your art, it was amazing.
[02:27:43.277 --> 02:27:45.938]  Tell us some about your art, because it is very diverse.
[02:27:47.379 --> 02:27:49.780]  Yeah, well, I talked to a...
[02:27:53.117 --> 02:27:53.357]  Yeah.
[02:28:13.753 --> 02:28:16.855]  Um, hanging some stuff up in my house and I didn't want to pay for it.
[02:28:17.655 --> 02:28:24.599]  And, uh, and so I had people come over and they're just like, wow, that's really some really nice stuff.
[02:28:24.719 --> 02:28:29.562]  And, and I was like, well, um, uh, you want to buy it?
[02:28:29.602 --> 02:28:29.822]  You know?
[02:28:30.823 --> 02:28:33.024]  And it just, it's just snowballed into that.
[02:28:33.084 --> 02:28:36.966]  That's not what we're showing is good, but the stuff we had up last time, I guess you've already sold all that.
[02:28:37.226 --> 02:28:38.647]  It was like all the trees and stuff.
[02:28:39.187 --> 02:28:39.528]  Yeah.
[02:28:40.248 --> 02:28:40.888]  Oh, I like that.
[02:28:40.948 --> 02:28:43.730]  But it was like trees, like blue trees with a red background.
[02:28:43.750 --> 02:28:45.851]  Yeah, that's Copper Forest.
[02:28:46.472 --> 02:28:49.253]  That's right there to the left.
[02:28:49.333 --> 02:28:50.134]  No, the other way.
[02:28:50.174 --> 02:28:50.994]  Yeah, not that one.
[02:28:51.794 --> 02:28:53.015]  That one's Fire Forest.
[02:28:53.235 --> 02:28:53.716]  I like that.
[02:28:54.616 --> 02:28:56.497]  That one, if you go to the right.
[02:28:57.918 --> 02:28:59.419]  Keep on going, keep on going, keep on going.
[02:28:59.639 --> 02:29:01.320]  Right there, that's the Copper Forest.
[02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:08.043]  I sold, I think, one big one and one small one of those.
[02:29:08.304 --> 02:29:08.884]  I like that one.
[02:29:10.800 --> 02:29:14.182]  Maybe I should commission one of those for the office.
[02:29:14.802 --> 02:29:16.063]  I like how it's in three panels, too.
[02:29:16.303 --> 02:29:16.743]  Definitely.
[02:29:17.764 --> 02:29:20.586]  So were you a painter before you were injured?
[02:29:20.986 --> 02:29:29.651]  Yeah, my mom had a book and it had so many different things I've done all my whole life.
[02:29:31.011 --> 02:29:38.576]  And it seems, I guess, after the IED, I kind of lost some of those memories, but it seems like I've been doing it my whole life.
[02:29:40.655 --> 02:29:41.155]  Amazing.
[02:29:41.735 --> 02:29:45.936]  Well, Army veteran Mario Lopez is here in studio with us.
[02:29:46.477 --> 02:29:50.037]  Paintings by MarioLopez.com, but he doesn't even really want to talk about that.
[02:29:50.077 --> 02:29:53.298]  He's really talking about his site, HowIKnow.org.
[02:29:53.338 --> 02:29:56.419]  I'll give folks my take on creationism when we come back.
[02:29:56.599 --> 02:29:57.499]  We're on the march.
[02:29:58.000 --> 02:29:59.580]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:00.520 --> 02:30:03.201]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:07.595 --> 02:30:10.696]  Alex Jones here with a very important announcement for truth seekers.
[02:30:11.076 --> 02:30:16.797]  We've carried a lot of amazing films and books over the years on the online video bookstore at Infowars.com.
[02:30:17.017 --> 02:30:23.418]  And out of all the titles we've carried, one stands out because it is just so chillingly convincing.
[02:30:23.598 --> 02:30:29.019]  And that's Dreams from My Real Father by Joel Gilbert, available at Infowars.com.
[02:30:29.299 --> 02:30:32.920]  This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen.
[02:30:33.120 --> 02:30:36.682]  If you want to know who Obama's real daddy is, this is the film for you.

[02:30:44.027 --> 02:30:47.569]  None Dare Call a Conspiracy by Gary Allen, the book that woke me up.
[02:30:47.889 --> 02:30:52.172]  We're also carrying Behind the Green Mask, UN Agenda 21, by Rosa Corey.
[02:30:52.312 --> 02:30:54.954]  This book is coffin nails to the globalist takeover.
[02:30:55.254 --> 02:31:01.818]  The Greater Good, the most professional and up-to-date film I've ever seen, exposing the scourge that is vaccines.
[02:31:02.078 --> 02:31:06.801]  These titles and a lot more are all available at InfoWarshot.com.
[02:31:07.541 --> 02:31:13.145]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[02:31:13.345 --> 02:31:20.569]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[02:31:20.729 --> 02:31:23.891]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[02:31:24.071 --> 02:31:25.852]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[02:31:26.092 --> 02:31:30.676]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[02:31:30.756 --> 02:31:33.518]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[02:31:33.678 --> 02:31:39.442]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[02:31:39.642 --> 02:31:43.104]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[02:31:43.304 --> 02:31:48.368]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine.
[02:31:48.568 --> 02:31:51.530]  Exclusively available at Infowarslife.com.
[02:31:51.770 --> 02:31:57.636]  Nascent Iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.
[02:31:57.756 --> 02:31:59.758]  Survival Shield Nascent Iodine.

[02:32:05.444 --> 02:32:06.805]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:32:07.306 --> 02:32:10.469]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[02:32:10.749 --> 02:32:15.592]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[02:32:15.772 --> 02:32:22.976]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[02:32:22.996 --> 02:32:28.500]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[02:32:28.720 --> 02:32:30.901]  These are items that I did research on.
[02:32:31.001 --> 02:32:32.342]  That I personally use.
[02:32:32.742 --> 02:32:37.264]  You've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[02:32:37.464 --> 02:32:42.706]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[02:32:42.946 --> 02:32:45.988]  Strategic Relocation 3rd Edition by Joel Skousen.
[02:32:46.188 --> 02:32:48.409]  When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.
[02:32:48.689 --> 02:32:53.251]  Therosafe, used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[02:32:53.411 --> 02:32:55.852]  Hand Crank Shortwave AM FM Radios.
[02:32:56.312 --> 02:33:03.356]  Everything that we've researched and found to be the best is available at InfoWarsShop.com and your purchase makes our InfoWars possible.
[02:33:03.516 --> 02:33:04.577]  We're getting prepared.
[02:33:04.797 --> 02:33:05.217]  Are you?
[02:33:05.458 --> 02:33:21.607]  InfoWarsShop.com Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:33:22.267 --> 02:33:24.088]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:26.374 --> 02:33:27.795]  Alright, I'm going to go to your phone calls.
[02:33:27.815 --> 02:33:28.896]  They're all over the map.
[02:33:28.936 --> 02:33:32.878]  You can also address any questions to Mario Lopez, a veteran of the U.S.
[02:33:32.958 --> 02:33:34.680]  Army in Iraq and then Afghanistan.
[02:33:34.700 --> 02:33:51.711]  He was in a combat engineering unit and was pinned after a 300-pound improvised explosive device for at least five minutes while he was conscious under it and burned and lost his arm and eye and other parts of his body.
[02:33:51.771 --> 02:33:54.133]  But his human spirit shines through.
[02:33:54.913 --> 02:34:11.386]  And he's here with us today, and he has had an experience that other cultures that aren't even Christian, and now they've been able to translate the Sanskrit and all the other different hieroglyphs, that this is the experience people have.
[02:34:11.406 --> 02:34:15.309]  This is what goes on when you die.
[02:34:15.329 --> 02:34:17.271]  There have been so many atheists and people that have died.
[02:34:17.951 --> 02:34:20.433]  And then resuscitated to become Christians.
[02:34:20.453 --> 02:34:22.514]  And I don't mean establishment Christian.
[02:34:22.574 --> 02:34:23.655]  That's totally taken over.
[02:34:24.215 --> 02:34:26.156]  It's like the system putting itself in front of that.
[02:34:26.176 --> 02:34:28.938]  But there are things we don't know about in this universe.
[02:34:28.978 --> 02:34:29.619]  I'll tell you right now.
[02:34:29.779 --> 02:34:34.822]  And the people running things know it, and are obsessed with it, and are programming us with symbols.
[02:34:36.127 --> 02:34:46.976]  And whether you believe what David Icke believes, or you believe what people like myself believe, there is something out there that there's a lot of unseen out on this planet and space.
[02:34:47.557 --> 02:34:51.860]  We only see a very small spectrum of what's going on.
[02:34:51.880 --> 02:34:54.722]  I want to go to your phone calls, but I want to be able to give us his view on creationism.
[02:34:54.742 --> 02:34:58.405]  You know, people always ask me, what is my view on this?
[02:34:59.426 --> 02:35:00.107]  Here's the issue.
[02:35:02.462 --> 02:35:11.248]  If you go back about 180 years ago, the establishment wanted to discredit Christianity and bring in their occult systems that were even older.
[02:35:12.729 --> 02:35:15.271]  And so they made it, oh, you're not scientific.
[02:35:15.291 --> 02:35:23.176]  And then in the last hundred years, they would do fake built-down man and fake cavemen, proving the missing link over and over again with fraud, just like global warming, all the rest of it.
[02:35:23.196 --> 02:35:24.997]  A lot of fraud and establishment science.
[02:35:26.438 --> 02:35:27.659]  To say we're just animals,
[02:35:28.700 --> 02:35:30.601]  To say there's no soul, to say there's no spirit.
[02:35:30.862 --> 02:35:38.787]  Because if you don't know there's a war going on for your decision in this universe, which side, even if you're like, I want to call it New Age, you believe in light or darkness.
[02:35:39.107 --> 02:35:40.749]  I'm trying to just quantify this now.
[02:35:40.769 --> 02:35:48.094]  Because the preachers want to beat people over the head with it and make it about whatever religious group you're in, only their Christian group's the one that's the good one.
[02:35:48.414 --> 02:35:50.155]  That's meant to keep everybody divided.
[02:35:50.395 --> 02:35:52.197]  It's another tool of the devil, in my view.
[02:35:53.444 --> 02:36:01.032]  But the Bible talks about, you know, other creations and things destroyed before, you know, Adam and Eve and all of that.
[02:36:01.092 --> 02:36:03.675]  So I don't debate the real age of this planet.
[02:36:04.096 --> 02:36:06.839]  I don't debate all these other things that are going on.
[02:36:06.859 --> 02:36:09.942]  A day was as a year, a year was as a day, it says in Genesis.
[02:36:10.743 --> 02:36:13.505]  You know, how God chooses to describe how the planet was built.
[02:36:13.565 --> 02:36:14.206]  It's darkness.
[02:36:14.706 --> 02:36:19.049]  And then God creates, you know, out of the void, new things.
[02:36:19.109 --> 02:36:19.790]  And then the light.
[02:36:20.130 --> 02:36:24.593]  And then you go to the science that's basically, you know, just stalled how it was done.
[02:36:24.633 --> 02:36:28.276]  And so much of what was science fact 20 years ago, now they admit isn't true.
[02:36:28.616 --> 02:36:34.381]  So many genetic engineers now become religious because they can go and see the design in it.
[02:36:35.425 --> 02:36:43.329]  And the claim that out of a bunch of sand or water, cells were thrown together that are a billion times more complex than a fine Swiss wristwatch.
[02:36:44.009 --> 02:36:47.231]  Are you going to find a fine watch in the Sahara that wasn't made by someone?
[02:36:47.411 --> 02:36:49.712]  Because over enough time, sand blew together to make it?
[02:36:50.192 --> 02:36:58.576]  Look at Prometheus, the elite actually, and I did a video on this on the review of Secrets of Prometheus Revealed, where they believe
[02:37:00.029 --> 02:37:01.612]  I forget the exact scientific name of it.
[02:37:01.632 --> 02:37:03.557]  I think it's Transpermia or whatever.
[02:37:03.577 --> 02:37:07.766]  But the point is that we were seeded by Master... Say it again?
[02:37:08.786 --> 02:37:09.546]  Panspermia.
[02:37:10.226 --> 02:37:12.467]  That we were seeded by aliens.
[02:37:13.187 --> 02:37:16.568]  Well, see, I mean, even the scientists now are going, it's aliens!
[02:37:17.649 --> 02:37:19.449]  Evolution is impossible the way we say.
[02:37:19.929 --> 02:37:27.672]  I'm not saying things don't breed, things don't change, cars don't evolve, people don't change, people don't, you know, develop certain traits.
[02:37:27.712 --> 02:37:28.772]  That's certainly there.
[02:37:29.352 --> 02:37:31.693]  But the lie of Darwin, who was an occultist,
[02:37:32.930 --> 02:37:36.071]  Who said he was given his knowledge by dark angels?
[02:37:36.271 --> 02:37:37.432]  See, that's an interesting thing.
[02:37:37.572 --> 02:37:40.833]  The theory of Darwinism is like he saw an angel in a near-death experience.
[02:37:40.913 --> 02:37:44.655]  Darwin actually said that entities gave him his knowledge.
[02:37:46.942 --> 02:37:48.603]  And it's totally wild.
[02:37:48.923 --> 02:37:51.965]  His whole family set up eugenics that Hitler came out of.
[02:37:52.265 --> 02:37:54.147]  So see, people don't really know where Darwin comes from.
[02:37:54.387 --> 02:37:58.369]  He's like this icon god when he's really just a Malthusian.
[02:37:58.890 --> 02:38:00.591]  If you don't know who Malthus was, look it up.
[02:38:00.991 --> 02:38:02.712]  So I've given you some background where I stand.
[02:38:02.993 --> 02:38:04.654]  I believe it's all a false debate.
[02:38:05.334 --> 02:38:11.519]  Clearly the official stories were told about how old the earth is and about how things work have been proven wrong.
[02:38:12.319 --> 02:38:21.365]  Even top scientists admit, no, things just show up on the developmental line suddenly during times of incredible mutation, but they can't ever find the mutation.
[02:38:22.425 --> 02:38:23.786]  So, that's what's going on.
[02:38:23.826 --> 02:38:25.067]  Clearly, this was designed.
[02:38:25.407 --> 02:38:26.408]  Clearly, this was built.
[02:38:27.368 --> 02:38:31.231]  And clearly, it didn't grow even out of space rocks that had microbes in them.
[02:38:31.891 --> 02:38:33.372]  Okay, folks, this was engineered.
[02:38:35.273 --> 02:38:35.994]  This was engineered.
[02:38:37.426 --> 02:38:40.207]  And now all of the atheist people are now saying it's aliens.
[02:38:40.227 --> 02:38:41.547]  Well, then you're not even atheist, are you?
[02:38:42.147 --> 02:38:50.069]  You just are people that say, we're not allowed to have a debate about this, when all the agents in every culture said, angels came here, that's where humans basically come from.
[02:38:50.089 --> 02:38:51.590]  Well, that's what the Bible says.
[02:38:51.630 --> 02:38:56.471]  And it says that there were angels coming down and basically having sex with women, the Nephilim.
[02:38:57.411 --> 02:39:01.773]  And that there were genetic abominations created, and then a cleansing.
[02:39:02.233 --> 02:39:03.873]  And then now look at the genetic engineering today.
[02:39:03.893 --> 02:39:06.514]  Look at what the elite do, trying to destroy all the creation.
[02:39:07.622 --> 02:39:10.843]  And that Noah was the only one who had perfect in his generation.
[02:39:10.863 --> 02:39:12.383]  It's not in his behavior.
[02:39:12.703 --> 02:39:15.824]  He got drunk and stuff and ran around naked and got made fun of by his kids.
[02:39:16.224 --> 02:39:18.204]  The point is he was perfect in his genetics.
[02:39:19.024 --> 02:39:20.565]  So it's archetypes to explain this to us.
[02:39:20.585 --> 02:39:21.505]  Now, I've given my view.
[02:39:21.525 --> 02:39:29.086]  I'm going to give you the floor now for about five minutes to give your view on creationism and also point out you go and speak for free at churches and give your testimony that I think is very important.
[02:39:29.126 --> 02:39:35.288]  If folks want to contact you at HowIKnow.org and paintingsbyMarioLopez.com but
[02:39:36.648 --> 02:39:39.909]  Give us your take on creationism.
[02:39:40.589 --> 02:39:48.450]  Because I disagree with how some of the preachers, they describe what creationism is, and then we're supposed to listen to them or the Darwinists.
[02:39:48.490 --> 02:39:51.531]  How about I go read the Bible, I decide what I'm really seeing there.
[02:39:51.551 --> 02:39:51.851]  Go ahead.
[02:39:52.671 --> 02:39:54.332]  I believe in the six-day creation.
[02:39:55.312 --> 02:39:57.212]  It's very explainable in the Bible.
[02:39:58.132 --> 02:40:00.593]  And, you know, six-day creation.
[02:40:01.912 --> 02:40:03.112]  What about my position?
[02:40:03.153 --> 02:40:04.374]  Because I'm saying I don't know.
[02:40:04.514 --> 02:40:13.721]  I believe the Bible and I'm saying they've created a fake debate by men, the preachers, with the scientists in a fight making it about them.
[02:40:14.121 --> 02:40:16.784]  When the eye has not seen, the ear has not heard the things of God.
[02:40:16.804 --> 02:40:23.209]  Yeah, I think you're talking about whenever they believe in the Gap Theory.
[02:40:23.989 --> 02:40:25.090]  I think that's what you're talking about.
[02:40:25.851 --> 02:40:27.893]  The Gap Theory doesn't really
[02:40:29.423 --> 02:40:34.669]  It doesn't really mesh well with the Bible, because then you can leave in room for evolution.
[02:40:36.190 --> 02:40:40.575]  But I think the way to attack their evolution theory is to point out they admit it's all crud now.
[02:40:40.595 --> 02:40:48.804]  I mean, they still teach school kids it's a fact, but if you look at it, it isn't the way they've said.
[02:40:48.824 --> 02:40:50.186]  I mean, their theory is wrong.
[02:40:50.848 --> 02:40:53.889]  Yeah, there's Heckler's drawings.
[02:40:54.209 --> 02:40:54.910]  I think it's Heckler.
[02:40:55.710 --> 02:41:06.114]  They have these primordial... They have these... I don't really... My wife is the one that... She's a biologist, yeah.
[02:41:06.134 --> 02:41:15.858]  She's a biologist, you know, I just... But they have these drawings that they tried to explain how we all come from
[02:41:18.119 --> 02:41:43.890]  single-cell organism and we take the same steps like a human take the same steps as a as a duck or whatever well they've been they've proved that since wrong since the 1850s and they're still in textbooks in some form today no that's the thing at actual science level they admit the whole thing's a fraud and they believe space aliens did it that's what most biologists and scientists now believe I mean they'll say somebody brought this here it's a master engineer it's but but still they teach as you said 150 year old crud to school kids
[02:41:45.731 --> 02:41:49.595]  Yeah, well, this whole deal with aliens, they're demons.
[02:41:50.036 --> 02:41:50.736]  Well, exactly.
[02:41:50.817 --> 02:41:52.018]  I'm not saying I agree with that.
[02:41:52.138 --> 02:41:56.042]  I'm saying, in real academia, they've had to admit it's all pure bull.
[02:41:56.463 --> 02:42:06.494]  Yeah, they turn it into, well, it's not fact, it's a philosophy, and it's just a way of looking at things, and then their whole theory breaks down.
[02:42:08.149 --> 02:42:17.798]  I'm saying the Bible manifestly proves that it's accurate and is revelation, but then people have ancient interpretations of it that are interpretations of men.
[02:42:18.198 --> 02:42:22.321]  We then take those on as the real spiritual interpretation.
[02:42:22.642 --> 02:42:24.784]  When I look at it, take revelation.
[02:42:25.164 --> 02:42:30.088]  There's no way somebody 2,000 years ago on an island came up with that without divine inspiration.
[02:42:30.288 --> 02:42:30.449]  Right.
[02:42:30.669 --> 02:42:32.330]  You read it, it's what's actually happening.
[02:42:32.530 --> 02:42:32.731]  Right.
[02:42:33.311 --> 02:42:37.212]  But then they'll argue, well, that's self-fulfilling prophecy that the elite have taken this plan.
[02:42:37.652 --> 02:42:39.133]  Well, regardless, it's being manifest.
[02:42:40.193 --> 02:42:42.894]  Yeah, it's nothing that you can't change.
[02:42:42.914 --> 02:42:44.074]  It's going to happen, you know.
[02:42:45.095 --> 02:42:51.197]  So, all we can really do is just warn people and try to point them to Christ, you know.
[02:42:52.097 --> 02:42:53.237]  That's all we can really do.
[02:42:53.618 --> 02:42:57.379]  Well, it's amazing hearing your story about the near-death experience.
[02:43:02.076 --> 02:43:07.378]  Craig Roberts, well there's Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, the economist, and there's Colonel Craig Roberts, my friend.
[02:43:08.078 --> 02:43:09.799]  But, you know, he talks about dead for 10 minutes.
[02:43:10.700 --> 02:43:14.521]  Bled out on the table, you know, in a stomach surgery for cancer.
[02:43:14.921 --> 02:43:15.161]  Dead.
[02:43:15.181 --> 02:43:16.242]  They'd gone, they'd walked off.
[02:43:17.062 --> 02:43:18.923]  It was like, zip him up, he's dead.
[02:43:19.563 --> 02:43:20.083]  Declared dead.
[02:43:20.103 --> 02:43:20.904]  10 minutes.
[02:43:22.384 --> 02:43:23.927]  Stop resuscitating before 4 or 5.
[02:43:24.549 --> 02:43:25.451]  Try and resuscitate.
[02:43:25.611 --> 02:43:27.295]  And just the whole 9 yards.
[02:43:27.315 --> 02:43:31.544]  I think they call that medical phenomenon the Lazarus Effect.
[02:43:31.705 --> 02:43:31.885]  Yeah.
[02:43:33.561 --> 02:43:34.862]  But, I mean, atheists have it.
[02:43:35.282 --> 02:43:37.102]  And they go, what's your brain trying to sort things out?
[02:43:37.162 --> 02:43:58.671]  No, it's you're taken to a portal, there's hell right there, heaven right there, he's brought right up to, like, the decision point of the portal, and literally, he was given, and this happens to a lot of people, here's all this data, when he came back he was so much smarter, he understood things, he was given discernment, and literally, just like in the TV shows and stuff, you know, because they archetype that, literally sent back with a mission.
[02:44:00.312 --> 02:44:00.912]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:44:04.028 --> 02:44:09.852]  Just imagine we're on this planet in space and there's this whole interdimensional war going on all around us.
[02:44:09.892 --> 02:44:11.313]  Of course we're an incredible creation.
[02:44:12.454 --> 02:44:14.615]  And there's incredible missions we have in the future.
[02:44:14.635 --> 02:44:20.419]  And literally God is deciding, you know, is literally getting his people in this test.
[02:44:21.340 --> 02:44:23.001]  This is a real free will test.
[02:44:23.481 --> 02:44:25.062]  Because God's got to give free creatures.
[02:44:25.102 --> 02:44:28.785]  See, the angels only have, I guess you'd call it, semi-free will.
[02:44:31.345 --> 02:44:34.066]  It's very complex, but then we have free will.
[02:44:34.106 --> 02:44:35.506]  We are made in the image of God.
[02:44:35.726 --> 02:44:35.926]  Right.
[02:44:36.166 --> 02:44:37.907]  And so we have to be given the free will.
[02:44:37.947 --> 02:44:39.847]  That's why God puts us through all of this.
[02:44:39.867 --> 02:44:44.688]  Yeah, it's like if you want someone to love you, you can't make them love you.
[02:44:44.708 --> 02:44:47.048]  And that's what this whole thing is about.
[02:44:47.488 --> 02:44:49.189]  It's about, are we going to love God?
[02:44:49.249 --> 02:44:54.429]  And then whenever I visited hell, I accepted it.
[02:44:54.570 --> 02:44:55.830]  I knew I deserved to be there.
[02:44:57.591 --> 02:44:57.731]  What's
[02:45:15.913 --> 02:45:17.494]  I think I overdosed one night.
[02:45:18.255 --> 02:45:23.318]  I remember taking a lot of pills and as I could feel my heart beat slowing.
[02:45:23.338 --> 02:45:24.699]  This is after you've been injured?
[02:45:24.719 --> 02:45:25.720]  This is after I've been injured.
[02:45:26.080 --> 02:45:33.965]  I could feel my heart beat slowing and my breath not being as strong and just thinking, wow, you could die tonight.
[02:45:34.245 --> 02:45:35.626]  And I was like, you took a lot of pills.
[02:45:36.747 --> 02:45:42.852]  Well, I told myself, well, you deserve to go to heaven after everything you've been through, after everything you've done for your country.
[02:45:42.872 --> 02:45:50.878]  You know, I had this false thinking that my good works could have got me into heaven, you know?
[02:45:51.658 --> 02:45:52.119]  And so...
[02:45:53.317 --> 02:45:53.938]  I fell asleep.
[02:45:54.558 --> 02:45:58.683]  When I fell asleep, it was like I saw myself in my spirit.
[02:45:58.923 --> 02:46:05.550]  And it was like if you blow out a candle, you know how the smoke rises and when you blow out a candle, the smoke rises like that?
[02:46:05.951 --> 02:46:06.892]  That's what my spirit looked like.
[02:46:07.552 --> 02:46:12.337]  And my spirit started traveling down instead of up, and I was like, uh-oh, this ain't good.
[02:46:13.198 --> 02:46:17.122]  And, uh, I traveled through Earth and I saw this, uh, orange pinhole of light.
[02:46:17.242 --> 02:46:19.764]  And I got closer and closer and closer to it.
[02:46:19.945 --> 02:46:20.745]  Dimensional gate.
[02:46:21.146 --> 02:46:24.068]  Yeah, and, uh, as I got closer, I could feel the heat.
[02:46:24.248 --> 02:46:29.233]  And, and then, uh, next thing you know, I, I smacked down the, to the middle of hell.
[02:46:30.214 --> 02:46:33.277]  And I fall into, I fall inside a house with no roof.
[02:46:33.837 --> 02:46:38.602]  And there's a hurricane of fire going on the outside when the house is tumbling like tumbleweeds in the hurricane of fire.
[02:46:39.757 --> 02:46:48.683]  And then I saw some creatures in there, and I saw a woman levitating on an altar.
[02:46:49.063 --> 02:46:52.226]  And she looked what you would think a witch looks like.
[02:46:53.206 --> 02:46:59.551]  She had black sackcloth as a garment, and she had missing pieces of white hair.
[02:47:00.612 --> 02:47:01.814]  And she was very veiny.
[02:47:01.834 --> 02:47:03.276]  She looked like she was 150 years old.
[02:47:03.296 --> 02:47:04.738]  And she was just levitating.
[02:47:05.138 --> 02:47:07.762]  And these creatures, this one, he looked like a gargoyle.
[02:47:08.342 --> 02:47:11.026]  He just pulled me without even touching me to this lady.
[02:47:11.787 --> 02:47:12.408]  And then I woke up.
[02:47:13.223 --> 02:47:19.447]  But while I was there, the same exact time while this happened so quickly, I felt three things.
[02:47:19.667 --> 02:47:23.270]  Those were the only three things I was allowed to feel, because I'd probably be dead right now.
[02:47:24.110 --> 02:47:24.971]  I felt hate.
[02:47:25.611 --> 02:47:27.593]  The hate was like a tangible thing.
[02:47:27.613 --> 02:47:30.495]  It was like, you could bottle it if you wanted to.
[02:47:30.535 --> 02:47:30.995]  You could cut it.
[02:47:31.435 --> 02:47:32.156]  The hate with a knife.
[02:47:32.176 --> 02:47:33.537]  And that's the thing about the New World Order.
[02:47:33.597 --> 02:47:34.497]  They hate us.
[02:47:34.597 --> 02:47:35.898]  They come to kill, steal, and destroy.
[02:47:35.918 --> 02:47:37.059]  People go, why do they do all this?
[02:47:37.359 --> 02:47:39.681]  They hate people, especially children.
[02:47:40.041 --> 02:47:41.282]  Innocent, sweet little children.
[02:47:41.322 --> 02:47:43.043]  They want to torture the hell out of them.
[02:47:43.543 --> 02:47:43.863]  Go ahead.
[02:47:44.003 --> 02:47:45.164]  They're the image of God, that's why.
[02:47:45.184 --> 02:47:46.324]  That's right, yeah, that's exactly right.
[02:47:46.384 --> 02:47:48.364]  And, uh, I felt the hate.
[02:47:48.544 --> 02:47:52.986]  And, I mean, people can feel hate when you walk into a room if there's a bunch of people that don't like you.
[02:47:53.026 --> 02:47:54.146]  You can feel the hate sometimes.
[02:47:54.506 --> 02:47:56.026]  Well, this is like a million times over.
[02:47:58.487 --> 02:48:00.768]  And, like I said, you could bottle it if you wanted to.
[02:48:00.788 --> 02:48:01.948]  It's like a tangible thing.
[02:48:03.028 --> 02:48:04.508]  And then I felt the heat.
[02:48:05.048 --> 02:48:07.249]  And I know what being on fire feels like.
[02:48:07.369 --> 02:48:08.689]  I know what heat feels like on Earth.
[02:48:09.209 --> 02:48:11.950]  And I was underneath, you know, the debris for five minutes.
[02:48:13.250 --> 02:48:15.830]  The heat was like an acid in hell.
[02:48:16.651 --> 02:48:20.371]  On Earth, it's like, it looks the way it feels.
[02:48:20.591 --> 02:48:22.612]  It hurts here, it hurts here, it hurts here.
[02:48:23.152 --> 02:48:29.913]  You know, different, you know, as the flames, you know, the little flames, you know, go up and that's how it feels.
[02:48:31.001 --> 02:48:31.701]  But on earth.
[02:48:31.841 --> 02:48:33.182]  But in hell, it feels like acid.
[02:48:33.202 --> 02:48:35.403]  It's like all over my body all at the same time.
[02:48:35.803 --> 02:48:38.964]  And then, um... And then I felt the hopelessness.
[02:48:39.704 --> 02:48:43.205]  The hopelessness, I... That's why they like to torture children for long periods.
[02:48:43.485 --> 02:48:44.966]  They like to create hell on earth.
[02:48:45.626 --> 02:48:46.806]  The baby being helpless.
[02:48:46.967 --> 02:48:48.487]  The 3, 4, 5 year olds, their favorite.
[02:48:48.907 --> 02:48:50.308]  Begging for mommy, that's what they like.
[02:48:51.108 --> 02:48:53.749]  Yeah, and the hopelessness was like, um...
[02:48:55.489 --> 02:48:59.232]  I can attribute it to drinking chlorine or something.
[02:49:01.294 --> 02:49:04.636]  If you were to drink a gallon of chlorine, you know this is over.
[02:49:04.696 --> 02:49:05.216]  This is it.
[02:49:05.557 --> 02:49:06.177]  You're going to die.
[02:49:06.878 --> 02:49:18.326]  Or I could attribute it to if you were to get stopped by a police officer and you got a pound of marijuana and something like that.
[02:49:18.646 --> 02:49:19.867]  You see the headlights.
[02:49:19.967 --> 02:49:20.327]  That's how
[02:49:22.588 --> 02:49:24.590]  That's what the hopelessness feels like.
[02:49:24.610 --> 02:49:27.053]  You know that there's no way out.
[02:49:27.794 --> 02:49:28.334]  Incredible.
[02:49:28.514 --> 02:49:28.975]  Incredible.
[02:49:28.995 --> 02:49:30.516]  We're going to go to break and do a little bit of overdrive.
[02:49:30.556 --> 02:49:30.937]  I promise.
[02:49:30.957 --> 02:49:32.278]  We're going to go to Savage in Finland.
[02:49:33.019 --> 02:49:34.440]  And then next up will be Sgt.
[02:49:34.620 --> 02:49:37.363]  X. We're going to get to Dan, Carolyn, and Travis before the show ends.
[02:49:39.885 --> 02:49:41.067]  Any other points you want to make on that?
[02:49:41.621 --> 02:49:56.619]  No, I just want to encourage, if you're a pastor at a church, or if you're in a leadership position, for the listeners out there to give us a call, check out our website, and find out what we're about.
[02:49:57.139 --> 02:49:59.420]  This is what people need to be hearing in churches all day.
[02:49:59.500 --> 02:50:02.081]  Not about how to do what the church says and give them more money.
[02:50:02.161 --> 02:50:04.742]  And these guys all, it's just so fake.
[02:50:04.762 --> 02:50:07.923]  And then they give like homeland security messages that I know the government gave them.
[02:50:09.003 --> 02:50:14.265]  Those preachers, I'm telling you, are not going to want, they're going to go, God I served you, and they're going to go right into hell.
[02:50:15.466 --> 02:50:17.847]  And I hope they're all listening and watching out there right now.
[02:50:17.867 --> 02:50:20.988]  Because I can tell you right now, these preachers betraying people,
[02:50:22.321 --> 02:50:30.983]  And making these churches where it's all just to feel good and everything, and they're not out there fighting the evil of the world, they're not out there pointing out the devil's real, this is real, you need to make the right decision.
[02:50:31.323 --> 02:50:36.065]  If you're not hearing that, folks, hell and damnation speeches, then you know you're not in the right church.
[02:50:36.105 --> 02:50:41.446]  Yeah, Jesus spoke more about hell than anything really, you know, than heaven, you know.
[02:50:42.945 --> 02:50:45.947]  Well, I'm not up here on some high horse here judging people either.
[02:50:46.707 --> 02:50:51.510]  I've got a wicked streak a trillion miles wide, but my love of justice and God is unlimited.
[02:50:52.130 --> 02:50:56.573]  And I know good and evil folks, and I know it's real, and people better get that through their head.
[02:50:57.493 --> 02:50:58.934]  People better understand that.
[02:51:00.215 --> 02:51:01.776]  We're gonna be right back with your phone calls.
[02:51:01.816 --> 02:51:02.896]  I appreciate folks holding.
[02:51:02.916 --> 02:51:04.917]  Savage from Finland, you're up next.
[02:51:04.997 --> 02:51:05.698]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:51:07.663 --> 02:51:11.104]  It's been said, those who control the food, control the people.
[02:51:11.324 --> 02:51:15.045]  Are you concerned about GMO foods making you sick and affecting your mind?
[02:51:15.145 --> 02:51:21.067]  Many people suffer from lack of energy, insomnia, loss of stamina, weight gain, and the inability to think clearly.
[02:51:21.347 --> 02:51:31.411]  Genetically modified crops, processed foods, and toxic chemicals can compromise your health and are silently destroying your digestive system, which accounts for 80% of your immune system.
[02:51:31.551 --> 02:51:35.952]  Take back control of your health with Pro-EM1 Probiotic from Terragenic.
[02:51:36.212 --> 02:51:46.243]  Pro-EM1 probiotic helps protect your body against irritable bowel syndrome, constipation, Crohn's disease, celiac disease, diabetes, the common cold, and much more.
[02:51:46.363 --> 02:51:57.875]  And including a powerful probiotic like Pro-EM1 as part of your daily routine puts you back in control and prevents you from becoming a mindless zombie manipulated by the pharmaceutical and GMO agendas.

[02:52:20.278 --> 02:52:25.539]  But did you know the Berkeys have had independent lab tests done to prove just how effective they are?

[02:52:55.854 --> 02:52:56.895]  GoBerkey.com, home of the Berkey Guy.
[02:53:06.818 --> 02:53:07.558]  My name's Bruno.
[02:53:07.699 --> 02:53:08.779]  I'm 52 years old.
[02:53:09.059 --> 02:53:12.581]  I've tried different protein powders over the years, and they've all tasted pretty bad.
[02:53:12.681 --> 02:53:14.742]  I tried One World Way and found it to be delicious.
[02:53:14.963 --> 02:53:20.506]  After 10 weeks on One World Way, my wife commented, you have more muscles and you're leaner than when you were 20 years old.
[02:53:20.926 --> 02:53:22.487]  My body has changed dramatically.
[02:53:23.027 --> 02:53:23.708]  I'm a cyclist.
[02:53:23.948 --> 02:53:26.470]  Normally I'll ride two days on and take two days off.
[02:53:26.970 --> 02:53:36.757]  After being on One World Way, I rode 10 days in a row in over 100 degree heat and then I take another two servings of One World Way and then work out at the gym for another hour and a half.
[02:53:37.097 --> 02:53:38.798]  I just couldn't believe these results.
[02:53:39.299 --> 02:53:42.821]  My normal muscle tightness and soreness after working out are virtually gone.
[02:53:43.482 --> 02:53:44.602]  Don't take my word for it.
[02:53:44.983 --> 02:53:46.604]  One World Way comes in single servings.
[02:53:47.004 --> 02:53:47.905]  Just give it a try.
[02:53:48.499 --> 02:53:51.602]  For a health and taste sensation you'll love, call 888-988-3325.
[02:53:51.642 --> 02:53:52.022]  That's 888-988-3325.
[02:53:52.542 --> 02:53:52.923]  That's 888-988-3325.
[02:53:53.063 --> 02:53:54.204]  Or visit OneWorldWay.com.
[02:53:54.224 --> 02:53:55.124]  That's OneWorld, W-H-E-Y.com.
[02:54:21.753 --> 02:54:33.638]  We're going to do a little bit of overdrive, obviously, to take your phone calls here.
[02:54:33.758 --> 02:54:40.681]  And look, even if you don't believe in God or the devil or good and evil, there are good forces and bad forces in this universe.
[02:54:40.701 --> 02:54:42.142]  There's energy, whatever you want to call it.
[02:54:43.042 --> 02:54:44.783]  And I'm not trying to be New Agey here.
[02:54:44.803 --> 02:54:47.404]  I'm just trying to get people to understand there's a lot going on.
[02:54:48.618 --> 02:54:49.899]  And the state is not God.
[02:54:49.979 --> 02:54:51.200]  Hollywood is not God.
[02:54:51.720 --> 02:54:53.241]  It is a facsimile.
[02:54:53.261 --> 02:54:56.963]  It is something wanting to control our perceptions and take our free will.
[02:54:57.883 --> 02:55:00.065]  And it is evil by every stretch of the imagination.
[02:55:00.085 --> 02:55:01.425]  They tell you, oh, there's no good or evil.
[02:55:01.826 --> 02:55:04.407]  That's so you don't have any gauge of what's going on.
[02:55:06.068 --> 02:55:07.109]  Let's take some phone calls.
[02:55:07.229 --> 02:55:08.389]  Savage in Finland.
[02:55:08.670 --> 02:55:10.731]  You're on The Year with Army veteran Mario Lopez.
[02:55:10.751 --> 02:55:11.131]  Go ahead.
[02:55:13.212 --> 02:55:13.893]  Good evening, sir.
[02:55:14.273 --> 02:55:14.593]  Hey, buddy.
[02:55:16.476 --> 02:55:17.036]  How are you, Alex?
[02:55:17.457 --> 02:55:17.877]  I'm fine.
[02:55:17.897 --> 02:55:20.059]  Thanks for calling in and holding while we had our guest on.
[02:55:20.079 --> 02:55:21.220]  You want to talk about Obamacare?
[02:55:23.002 --> 02:55:23.602]  Well, yeah.
[02:55:23.662 --> 02:55:26.985]  Well, actually, I have a few points before going into that, if you don't mind.
[02:55:27.005 --> 02:55:27.506]  Sure, go ahead.
[02:55:29.648 --> 02:55:38.736]  Well, first of all, I heard, like, a few weeks ago, you talked about, like, people who wanted to affect this system and wake people up at the same time.
[02:55:39.608 --> 02:55:48.251]  And I've actually thought of this myself, and I'm actually thinking of getting involved in Finnish politics and going for the Congress in Finland.
[02:55:49.712 --> 02:55:50.612]  Well, that's the answer.
[02:55:50.652 --> 02:55:52.273]  Good people need to run for office.
[02:55:53.133 --> 02:55:55.754]  Maybe mayor first, or water district head, or something.
[02:55:56.594 --> 02:56:04.257]  But it's also good to aim high, but everyone should run for office who loves liberty, and then we would overpower the system if we just got up off our butts.
[02:56:04.337 --> 02:56:05.137]  I agree, that's a good idea.
[02:56:07.198 --> 02:56:07.378]  Yeah.
[02:56:08.297 --> 02:56:13.979]  And also, Alex, like, a few times I've heard you saying that you're a weak person.
[02:56:14.119 --> 02:56:19.081]  Do not ever say that, because you're one of the strongest persons I know of.
[02:56:19.502 --> 02:56:29.326]  You're, like, the courage that you have of taking upon these comebacks, these overwhelmments, and these globalists.
[02:56:29.766 --> 02:56:33.147]  You have a, like, you're not weak at all.
[02:56:33.227 --> 02:56:34.788]  You shouldn't say that at all, ever.
[02:56:35.404 --> 02:56:35.564]  Well,
[02:57:01.883 --> 02:57:29.322]  I think that it's amazing what he's talking about because the thing is that I myself completely believe in extraterrestrials and that like human life evolved with their help and like whenever you look like wherever you look I mean in the historical sites you can see paintings of aliens and stuff like for example I'm Persian so I know Persian history
[02:57:29.983 --> 02:57:48.773]  For example, the Zoroastrian history, it's a religion where they keep fire as holy and the symbol of Zoroastrian, it's like a bird thingy with a man inside it.
[02:57:49.273 --> 02:57:50.854]  Sure, you're talking about the Zoroastrians?
[02:57:52.991 --> 02:57:54.653]  I have no idea how it's pronounced.
[02:57:54.673 --> 02:57:55.053]  Sure, sure.
[02:57:55.093 --> 02:57:56.694]  I got to jump, because that's the end of this hour.
[02:57:56.714 --> 02:57:58.056]  But see, there's the issue.
[02:57:58.136 --> 02:57:59.417]  I see that, and God bless you, sir.
[02:57:59.457 --> 02:58:00.398]  I see that as the first step.
[02:58:00.838 --> 02:58:06.503]  See, the atheists, and of course we know they're cult leaders, they don't want people even thinking that there's something outside.
[02:58:06.523 --> 02:58:07.363]  It's all just boring.
[02:58:07.704 --> 02:58:08.484]  The planet's nothing.
[02:58:08.504 --> 02:58:09.705]  You know, there's nothing spiritual.
[02:58:09.725 --> 02:58:10.566]  There's nothing we don't know.
[02:58:10.966 --> 02:58:18.433]  It's at least one step for a lot of the atheists now to admit that evolution is a fraud and something built this.
[02:58:18.453 --> 02:58:20.534]  See, I see that as positive, what he was just saying.
[02:58:21.275 --> 02:58:21.876]  Yeah.
[02:58:21.936 --> 02:58:26.059]  Even though you would say and I would say those are, obviously those are fallen angels, those are manipulators.
[02:58:26.139 --> 02:58:26.399]  Yeah.
[02:58:27.080 --> 02:58:27.300]  Yeah.
[02:58:27.580 --> 02:58:28.401]  That's, I agree with that.
[02:58:28.741 --> 02:58:30.822]  They're completely, they're demons and, you know.
[02:58:31.143 --> 02:58:32.604]  Why do you think they want to destroy us?
[02:58:33.224 --> 02:58:34.005]  Because they hate us.
[02:58:34.485 --> 02:58:34.906]  They hate us.
[02:58:35.706 --> 02:58:36.847]  Like, that's, that's the bottom.
[02:58:36.867 --> 02:58:39.669]  Because we're made in the image of what cast them down.
[02:58:39.970 --> 02:58:40.210]  Right.
[02:58:40.910 --> 02:58:41.130]  Yeah.
[02:58:41.210 --> 02:58:41.791]  That's pretty heavy.
[02:58:42.912 --> 02:58:44.333]  We'll be right back.
[02:58:44.353 --> 02:58:44.833]  Stay with us.
[02:58:45.174 --> 02:58:49.997]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:58:57.362 --> 02:59:01.923]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[02:59:02.063 --> 02:59:05.044]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[02:59:05.204 --> 02:59:10.425]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[02:59:10.766 --> 02:59:12.326]  It all comes down to one thing.
[02:59:12.686 --> 02:59:14.026]  We are what we eat.
[02:59:14.327 --> 02:59:18.668]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[02:59:18.988 --> 02:59:22.969]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[02:59:23.209 --> 02:59:25.550]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[02:59:25.770 --> 02:59:31.632]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[03:00:12.202 --> 03:00:12.822]  Big Brother.
[03:00:13.503 --> 03:00:14.523]  Mainstream media.
[03:00:15.264 --> 03:00:16.364]  Government cover-ups.
[03:00:17.025 --> 03:00:17.825]  You want answers?
[03:00:18.606 --> 03:00:19.546]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:20.147 --> 03:00:23.769]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:24.349 --> 03:00:28.411]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:33.945 --> 03:00:36.607]  Army veteran Mario Lopez joins us.
[03:00:36.828 --> 03:00:38.389]  Paintings by MarioLopez.com.
[03:00:38.729 --> 03:00:39.270]  NowIKnow.org.
[03:00:39.370 --> 03:00:40.451]  Retain your phone calls.
[03:00:40.991 --> 03:00:45.495]  You were making some points about Project Blue Beam, the government's admission of... Blue Book.
[03:00:46.055 --> 03:00:47.657]  Well, there was Blue Book and then Blue Beam.
[03:00:47.737 --> 03:00:48.177]  Oh, okay.
[03:00:48.197 --> 03:00:49.118]  But no, you're right.
[03:00:49.158 --> 03:00:51.580]  Blue Book on the whole UFO phenomenon.
[03:00:51.740 --> 03:00:54.242]  And repeat what you said, because that reminded me of that.
[03:00:54.423 --> 03:01:01.208]  The Air Force General said that they were... that the spacecrafts were mesospherical, which I believe the...
[03:01:01.949 --> 03:01:03.630]  The definition is spiritual.
[03:01:04.411 --> 03:01:13.379]  That these entities that were driving these vehicles could not withstand those G-forces and would be completely smashed.
[03:01:13.399 --> 03:01:20.264]  Yeah, in our gravitational field, one one-millionth of it would smash them up against the wall like a pancake, the gravitation.
[03:01:20.565 --> 03:01:20.765]  Right.
[03:01:21.225 --> 03:01:27.510]  And I mean, these things are, you know, going 50,000 miles an hour, making right-hand, right-angle turns.
[03:01:27.851 --> 03:01:28.051]  Right.
[03:01:31.468 --> 03:01:34.249]  And so that's the whole point, is that it's not of this dimension.
[03:01:35.130 --> 03:01:53.017]  Right, they're interdimensional crafts, and they somehow get some sort of energy, and they are able to come into our dimension and have us see them, just so they can deceive us.
[03:01:53.077 --> 03:01:55.158]  They're the great deceivers of this world.
[03:01:57.443 --> 03:02:05.045]  Is it like, it's almost like a science fiction, but it's like a military, interdimensional force that wants our soul that's in this earth suit.
[03:02:05.845 --> 03:02:07.005]  It wants to suck that out.
[03:02:07.845 --> 03:02:15.267]  Yeah, I've heard someone, I don't believe this, but I've heard someone say that they use our energy as fuel and as food.
[03:02:15.967 --> 03:02:16.287]  I don't know.
[03:02:17.147 --> 03:02:18.968]  But, uh, yeah.
[03:02:20.848 --> 03:02:22.109]  Maybe that's why it's like being burned.
[03:02:22.129 --> 03:02:23.969]  They're like sucking you dry, is that what they're saying?
[03:02:25.168 --> 03:02:26.289]  I never get into all this stuff.
[03:02:26.329 --> 03:02:27.970]  The point is the elite are obsessed with it.
[03:02:28.570 --> 03:02:33.713]  And it's very interesting to just see how similar the Bible is to all the science fiction.
[03:02:34.614 --> 03:02:36.955]  But then they're like saying, oh, but the Bible has nothing to do with it.
[03:02:37.476 --> 03:02:39.217]  It's all discredited and everything.
[03:02:39.297 --> 03:02:41.258]  But then it just fits into the whole cosmology.
[03:02:41.698 --> 03:02:43.339]  And the establishment is obsessed with it.
[03:02:44.860 --> 03:02:50.004]  I mean, if you look at Skull and Bones, they believe they're worshipping fallen angels.
[03:02:50.884 --> 03:02:51.765]  That's Skull and Bones.
[03:02:52.759 --> 03:02:56.462]  Yeah, they believe that they're worshipping the real God.
[03:02:56.722 --> 03:02:58.303]  Because they've been deceived.
[03:02:58.343 --> 03:03:01.225]  It's like Luciferianism.
[03:03:01.405 --> 03:03:05.828]  They've been deceived in thinking that their God is really the right God.
[03:03:05.848 --> 03:03:08.950]  And then they got all the symbolism.
[03:03:09.050 --> 03:03:11.152]  But look at the fruits of these people.
[03:03:11.632 --> 03:03:12.933]  Right, yeah, what are the fruits of it?
[03:03:13.453 --> 03:03:14.874]  And I have a quote on my...
[03:03:16.824 --> 03:03:24.203]  On my website, the How I Know, and on Food for Thought, it talks about
[03:03:26.738 --> 03:03:31.942]  Figuring out the attributes of God, like if you see a butterfly, a butterfly is beautiful for no reason.
[03:03:32.923 --> 03:03:35.025]  Or snowflakes, every single snowflake.
[03:03:35.045 --> 03:03:36.706]  You recognize God's goodness.
[03:03:36.926 --> 03:03:37.206]  Right.
[03:03:37.667 --> 03:03:38.207]  He's love.
[03:03:38.888 --> 03:03:45.333]  And all these other religions and all these other takes on and views, they don't match up with what we see in nature.
[03:03:45.353 --> 03:03:51.197]  And then everything the New World Order produces is horrible, painful, you know, just horrible.
[03:03:51.497 --> 03:03:53.179]  The fruits of the New World Order are death.
[03:03:54.419 --> 03:04:03.947]  What I think is if there was a Creator out there, which there is, you know, Jesus, He would make a way for Him to speak to us.
[03:04:05.208 --> 03:04:11.673]  He would make a way for us to have communication with Him.
[03:04:12.834 --> 03:04:18.658]  And then He would explain the stuff that we're not supposed to do.
[03:04:21.522 --> 03:04:28.474]  And then these people are just sitting there just believing the stuff we're not supposed to do, which is, you know, believing in Lucifer and Satan and stuff.
[03:04:29.095 --> 03:04:29.335]  Wow.
[03:04:30.577 --> 03:04:31.499]  The god of this world.
[03:04:32.120 --> 03:04:32.781]  We're gonna go to break.
[03:04:32.841 --> 03:04:33.241]  I promise.
[03:04:33.281 --> 03:04:34.263]  Go quickly to Sargent.
[03:04:35.285 --> 03:04:39.828]  Then we'll go to Carolyn, Dan, Travis, and Alex.
[03:04:39.868 --> 03:04:42.770]  That'll be it for this original transmission.
[03:04:42.890 --> 03:04:44.071]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[03:04:44.532 --> 03:04:45.913]  Websites are InfoWars.com.

[03:06:47.512 --> 03:06:48.133]  I think so.
[03:07:06.923 --> 03:07:13.104]  Uncover a simple privacy loophole that can stop the NSA spying thugs in their tracks at PrivacyLockdown.com.
[03:07:13.265 --> 03:07:18.846]  The NSA has already shut down hundreds of sites, and to truth be told, they could shut down this operation at any time.
[03:07:19.126 --> 03:07:25.247]  See, the privacy loophole I'm about to show you allows you to make all your sensitive information disappear in the next 30 days or less.
[03:07:25.467 --> 03:07:34.149]  Go to PrivacyLockdown.com now to take your life off the grid and see the loophole in the NSA and FBI spying machine before they close the loophole forever.
[03:07:34.329 --> 03:07:35.550]  Go to PrivacyLockdown.com.
[03:07:36.810 --> 03:07:41.214]  Every day it becomes more clear our nation is headed towards an uncertain future.
[03:07:41.294 --> 03:07:44.877]  Nothing can ensure your family's security like an Atlas Survival Shelter.

[03:08:02.491 --> 03:08:03.912]  Atlas Survival Shelters.
[03:08:04.112 --> 03:08:05.894]  Better prepared than scared.
[03:08:07.540 --> 03:08:12.585]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:12.945 --> 03:08:15.248]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:08:20.647 --> 03:08:25.692]  He's here to tell about it and give his testimony to warn others.
[03:08:44.685 --> 03:08:47.646]  And again, I'm not judging anybody out there.
[03:08:47.666 --> 03:08:51.587]  If you've had abortions or whatever and now you admit it's wrong or whatever, you can go out and warn others.
[03:08:51.607 --> 03:08:57.968]  It's just this is a culture of death that wants to hurt people and the system is deceptive and wicked.
[03:08:59.008 --> 03:09:02.509]  And the fruits of the New World Order are death, regardless of what you think's behind it.
[03:09:02.789 --> 03:09:03.930]  We've got to say no to this.
[03:09:04.030 --> 03:09:04.790]  It's not good.
[03:09:05.210 --> 03:09:06.750]  It isn't taking us to a good place.
[03:09:07.430 --> 03:09:07.891]  Sgt.
[03:09:08.191 --> 03:09:11.371]  X wants to talk about possible false flag in Atlanta.
[03:09:11.872 --> 03:09:12.952]  And I actually have articles
[03:09:13.939 --> 03:09:17.842]  What I forgot to get to that I've just broken on Infowars.com the last 20 minutes or so.
[03:09:18.482 --> 03:09:21.724]  Dealing with people panicking over these drills.
[03:09:22.425 --> 03:09:25.627]  Panicked Iowans fear losing power during blackout drill.
[03:09:26.187 --> 03:09:28.669]  Obama cared down, blamed the hackers.
[03:09:29.009 --> 03:09:31.291]  Nemo's got an article out, they're now blaming imaginary hackers.
[03:09:31.751 --> 03:09:34.553]  Seattle Wi-Fi spy network has not been deactivated.
[03:09:34.593 --> 03:09:36.814]  That's big news that they lie to the public again.
[03:09:37.315 --> 03:09:38.876]  NSA snooping takes down U.S.
[03:09:38.896 --> 03:09:40.237]  computer network businesses.
[03:09:41.952 --> 03:09:45.514]  And the $1,000,000 TSA chat down program, a complete failure.
[03:09:45.894 --> 03:09:47.495]  That's up on DrugsReport.com.
[03:09:48.355 --> 03:09:51.197]  Trans-Pacific Partnership ready for Christmas delivery.
[03:09:51.857 --> 03:09:53.978]  World Government, I mean it's all happening.
[03:09:55.059 --> 03:09:57.080]  And let's go back to phone calls here.
[03:09:57.140 --> 03:09:58.360]  Sergeant X, you're on the air.
[03:09:58.380 --> 03:09:58.981]  Thanks for holding.
[03:09:59.021 --> 03:09:59.381]  Go ahead.
[03:10:00.501 --> 03:10:01.182]  Hey, Alex.
[03:10:01.522 --> 03:10:01.822]  Hey, buddy.
[03:10:01.842 --> 03:10:02.202]  Yes, sir.
[03:10:03.163 --> 03:10:03.563]  All right.
[03:10:03.583 --> 03:10:04.243]  Good to talk to you.
[03:10:04.283 --> 03:10:07.505]  First time caller, four-year listener.
[03:10:08.451 --> 03:10:11.693]  I want to give a shout out to my brother there, Mr. Lopez.
[03:10:11.933 --> 03:10:14.154]  I understand what you do.
[03:10:14.315 --> 03:10:15.655]  I appreciate what you're doing.
[03:10:15.735 --> 03:10:16.536]  Keep it going, brother.
[03:10:16.556 --> 03:10:17.136]  Alright, thank you.
[03:10:17.196 --> 03:10:19.378]  I want to talk to you real quick, man.
[03:10:20.558 --> 03:10:22.279]  I've been in for quite a while.
[03:10:22.339 --> 03:10:23.380]  I just recently got out.
[03:10:23.400 --> 03:10:25.261]  I've been in spec ops pretty much the whole time.
[03:10:25.281 --> 03:10:28.043]  Just a few things.
[03:10:28.063 --> 03:10:31.425]  That's why I've not identified my name, but never the less.
[03:10:32.992 --> 03:10:39.077]  When we went to, I don't hear this mentioned a lot, we went to clean up Hurricane Andrew in 92.
[03:10:39.857 --> 03:10:42.479]  In the 82nd, we were told to remove our patches.
[03:10:43.059 --> 03:10:43.780]  Beware of that.
[03:10:43.800 --> 03:10:46.922]  You don't want to identify it as a regular army.
[03:10:47.283 --> 03:10:51.165]  That's something that's pretty standard, I guess, nowadays.
[03:10:51.245 --> 03:10:53.187]  I didn't go to Katrina.
[03:10:53.287 --> 03:11:01.473]  Second thing, what these guys are doing in the military, mainly the brass, are telling the younger soldiers that
[03:11:02.162 --> 03:11:06.444]  You know, you took an oath against any enemy foreign domestic.
[03:11:07.064 --> 03:11:16.989]  What they're making the younger guys believe is that the terrorists, which are myself, Mr. Lopez, and yourself, Mr. Jones, are the
[03:11:17.898 --> 03:11:18.778]  They're domestic terrorists.
[03:11:18.798 --> 03:11:19.339]  That's what they're saying.
[03:11:19.359 --> 03:11:19.719]  Exactly.
[03:11:19.759 --> 03:11:26.202]  They spin it and they go enemies foreign and domestic and then they say patriots who are just pro-liberty that we're the terrorists.
[03:11:26.542 --> 03:11:33.805]  When enemies foreign and domestic means people like Obama who is overthrowing the country, that's clearly the domestic usurper.
[03:11:34.465 --> 03:11:36.466]  So enemies foreign and domestic, they're flipping.
[03:11:36.486 --> 03:11:37.566]  In fact, that's what I've been told.
[03:11:37.887 --> 03:11:45.630]  So they're, from what you know, they're teaching them, oh, enemies foreign and domestic, teaching them they're supposed to operate domestically against the American people.
[03:11:46.553 --> 03:11:47.514]  Exactly.
[03:11:47.614 --> 03:11:51.697]  They're saying, you know, these guys are going to stand up their militia, and this, that, and the other.
[03:11:51.757 --> 03:11:52.958]  They're the domestic ones.
[03:11:53.138 --> 03:12:00.503]  When, you know, it's just a brainwashing technique, and I'm sure Mr. Lopez there knows exactly what I'm talking about.
[03:12:00.684 --> 03:12:02.705]  The next thing was the main reason why I called.
[03:12:02.745 --> 03:12:10.651]  I have a brother that's a fellow Ranger, and he's recently got out looking for jobs, so and so forth, as we all do.
[03:12:11.600 --> 03:12:13.081]  He's pretty good-looking fella.
[03:12:13.141 --> 03:12:16.144]  He's been doing some stand-ins for acting.
[03:12:16.304 --> 03:12:21.207]  Just not a real good actor, but he's been doing a lot of stand-ins because of his disease.
[03:12:21.227 --> 03:12:26.151]  A lot of soldiers I know are getting hired to do acting, but yeah, go ahead.
[03:12:26.291 --> 03:12:27.992]  I sent you a link.
[03:12:28.553 --> 03:12:32.215]  There's a bunch of different sites calling in Atlanta area.
[03:12:32.235 --> 03:12:38.020]  This is the disturbing part, and the buzz is going around with all the actors in Atlanta.
[03:12:38.180 --> 03:12:39.601]  They're really getting scared because
[03:12:40.134 --> 03:12:44.837]  He and I both are listeners and he and I are waking as many people up as we can.
[03:12:46.158 --> 03:12:51.662]  But the buzz going around this is that I actually read it for myself because you know I verify everything even things that you say.
[03:12:53.943 --> 03:13:05.991]  They're looking for paramedics, they're looking for army personnel, active or out, firemen with their own attire, like I said paramedics, they're looking for
[03:13:06.750 --> 03:13:14.975]  Military, in or out, they're looking, this is the disturbing one, they're looking for amputees for something coming up in Atlanta.
[03:13:15.495 --> 03:13:17.156]  They're not announcing what it is.
[03:13:17.236 --> 03:13:20.498]  And for those who don't know, they'll have a real bomb go off.
[03:13:21.368 --> 03:13:30.639]  Blow up a couple people, but then have amputees and people for a drill, splatter fake blood on them, and then they get confused and they go, well, it was a drill.
[03:13:30.659 --> 03:13:32.281]  It just so happened to happen.
[03:13:32.341 --> 03:13:34.063]  In fact, we know this was going on at Boston.
[03:13:34.343 --> 03:13:40.170]  Then they cover up the drill in the news, but we were able to get it documented and found news where they admitted weeks before they were having a drill that day.
[03:13:41.291 --> 03:13:41.431]  Exactly.
[03:13:41.451 --> 03:13:46.994]  And he knows not to participate in any of it, but he's warning all the others, don't participate in it, especially if you're in uniform.
[03:14:02.105 --> 03:14:07.887]  You work for a paramedic, so... And listen, they could tell you show up with your own stuff, blow something up and say you did it.
[03:14:08.448 --> 03:14:09.788]  See, that's how this works, folks.
[03:14:10.188 --> 03:14:15.450]  We know the 7-7 bombers were like pretty much secular Muslims who were trying to get better jobs.
[03:14:15.470 --> 03:14:16.751]  They said, we'll be part of this drill.
[03:14:16.811 --> 03:14:17.771]  We know there was a drill.
[03:14:18.331 --> 03:14:19.692]  And some of them figured it out and ran.
[03:14:19.712 --> 03:14:22.893]  They gunned them down the street, covered that up, but it did come out in the news.
[03:14:23.713 --> 03:14:24.393]  Just incredible.
[03:14:24.433 --> 03:14:27.875]  I'm not saying there aren't some real terrorists out there, but the whole issue is
[03:14:28.874 --> 03:14:36.040]  They script these events, and it doesn't mean that just because they're trying to hire thousands of people for some drill, that it couldn't be a real drill.
[03:14:36.180 --> 03:14:37.101]  Most of the drills are real.
[03:14:37.501 --> 03:14:41.345]  But then some days they have a drill, and that's when the staged event happens.
[03:14:42.466 --> 03:14:54.876]  Send us at ShowTipsAtInfoWars.com, Sargent X, or whoever else is out there, these links to them trying to hire people for this drill, because we've found a bunch of other stuff they're doing, very similar things that look very suspicious.
[03:14:55.237 --> 03:14:56.438]  Thank you so much, and God bless you.
[03:14:58.666 --> 03:15:04.748]  Sounds like, Mario, you're saying you've been a little bit involved in research of false flags.
[03:15:05.188 --> 03:15:07.228]  Did you connect anything he was just saying?
[03:15:08.009 --> 03:15:23.993]  Oh yeah, like I was looking up the stuff with the Boston bombing and I was actually, me and my wife traveled down to Missouri for my father-in-law's birthday and where the World Series was going on and there was a
[03:15:29.181 --> 03:15:31.983]  DHS drill that they announced on the local news.
[03:15:32.844 --> 03:15:36.087]  And so I actually emailed y'all to let y'all know, but I don't know what happened.
[03:15:36.127 --> 03:15:41.171]  And again, they might have 400 drills that are normal, but also to demonize whoever the target is.
[03:15:41.231 --> 03:15:44.034]  It's always like a domestic group that's the bad guy, so it's brainwashing.
[03:15:44.514 --> 03:15:45.855]  But then they'll have the real event.
[03:15:45.875 --> 03:15:52.679]  We've just seen they always run a drill as their cover, so if their operatives that are 1% of the drill, a small team, get caught, I'm part of the drill.
[03:15:53.339 --> 03:15:54.380]  Russians do the same deal.
[03:15:55.440 --> 03:15:57.862]  And you also fund the terror attack through the drill as well.
[03:15:58.262 --> 03:16:02.345]  That then launders it so that the intelligence agency spying don't know what's happening.
[03:16:03.005 --> 03:16:05.687]  Let's go ahead, or it cloaks it, I should say, instead of launders it.
[03:16:06.667 --> 03:16:08.668]  Carolyn in Idaho, you're on the air.
[03:16:08.688 --> 03:16:09.269]  Thanks for holding.
[03:16:09.309 --> 03:16:09.569]  Welcome.
[03:16:10.282 --> 03:16:11.923]  Good morning, Alex.
[03:16:12.043 --> 03:16:14.324]  I want to tell you how much I appreciate you.
[03:16:14.344 --> 03:16:22.767]  And Mario, I want to thank you for taking the oath and everything you've done to help keep me and my family free.
[03:16:22.787 --> 03:16:33.252]  I want to bring up the point about the Seattle City Council saying that they didn't know about the surveillance being on.
[03:16:33.272 --> 03:16:38.614]  And there's an article from when the police chief
[03:16:39.915 --> 03:17:08.262]  He resigned last May about how he was happy to have innovation in place and how a city councilman, Tim Burgess, who was running for mayor and I don't know if he was elected, said Diaz was too slow to adopt the strategies for preventing crime by the DOJ.
[03:17:09.397 --> 03:17:19.247]  That's right, they're putting federal pre-crime systems in that grab all your data illegally, and then they turn it on when they're not supposed to, and then they say they're turning it off and don't.
[03:17:19.848 --> 03:17:23.332]  Again, it's a culture of pure deception against us.
[03:17:23.352 --> 03:17:26.415]  I mean, you would be less deceptive to a foreign enemy.
[03:17:26.495 --> 03:17:31.981]  I mean, this is just, they just, as a rule, they're changing the culture towards total fraud.
[03:17:34.059 --> 03:17:39.524]  So, that brings up the point that the city council already knew about this being in place.
[03:17:40.084 --> 03:17:41.165]  Oh, of course.
[03:17:41.205 --> 03:17:43.026]  The cops, the council, they're all going to play dumb.
[03:17:43.827 --> 03:17:44.688]  Until it blows over.
[03:17:44.708 --> 03:17:45.468]  I mean, that's what I'm saying.
[03:17:45.488 --> 03:17:49.412]  They're all just a bunch of federal minions and the feds themselves are run by globalists.
[03:17:49.752 --> 03:17:51.233]  Send us that article at Showtips.
[03:17:51.273 --> 03:17:51.814]  God bless you.
[03:17:51.834 --> 03:17:52.554]  Thank you very much.
[03:17:53.855 --> 03:17:55.957]  Let's talk to Dan in Texas real quick.
[03:17:55.977 --> 03:17:56.718]  Let's skip this network break.
[03:17:56.738 --> 03:17:57.739]  We're going to go to the bottom of the hour.
[03:17:58.899 --> 03:18:00.380]  If you can hang, you've been in there for over an hour.
[03:18:00.440 --> 03:18:00.960]  Can you do it?
[03:18:01.000 --> 03:18:01.161]  Yeah.
[03:18:01.181 --> 03:18:02.701]  Okay, we'll skip this network break at the bottom of the hour.
[03:18:03.002 --> 03:18:04.422]  Dan in Texas, go ahead, you're on the air.
[03:18:05.463 --> 03:18:05.963]  Alex Jones?
[03:18:06.223 --> 03:18:06.584]  Yes, sir.
[03:18:07.304 --> 03:18:09.065]  Hey, unbelievable that I got through.
[03:18:10.065 --> 03:18:17.990]  My question is, or actually a comment, I serve as the vice president on a board of directors of a case, or excuse me, of a credit union.
[03:18:18.430 --> 03:18:18.650]  Yes, sir.
[03:18:18.670 --> 03:18:19.731]  That's a medium size.
[03:18:20.620 --> 03:18:25.583]  And my wife is a bank manager of a little, you know, we got, we're only in about five counties of her bank.
[03:18:25.643 --> 03:18:28.565]  But the point is, you know how they hide things in plain sight?
[03:18:28.905 --> 03:18:29.225]  Yes.
[03:18:29.326 --> 03:18:31.807]  National Geographic put on that American blackout.
[03:18:31.827 --> 03:18:32.528]  We've got this drill.
[03:18:33.348 --> 03:18:33.568]  All right.
[03:18:33.588 --> 03:18:40.933]  The issue is all these NSF, these weird posts, my wife and I were having last year, man, I'm having all these weird posts on people's accounts.
[03:18:41.373 --> 03:18:43.394]  In other words, money's disappearing.
[03:18:43.434 --> 03:18:45.296]  Money's like, uh, it's just weird.
[03:18:45.336 --> 03:18:49.118]  So I called the manager of the credit union that I happen to be, you know, on the board of directors.
[03:18:49.728 --> 03:18:52.469]  And I just ran it by, hey, you got anything weird going on with your post?
[03:18:52.529 --> 03:18:54.289]  Anything going on with the customers?
[03:18:54.429 --> 03:18:55.829]  And she verified it too.
[03:18:55.969 --> 03:18:57.550]  So, I don't know.
[03:18:57.630 --> 03:19:04.671]  By way of heads up, you know, you know, when one hand shows, look over here, but really, this is what we're really doing.
[03:19:04.731 --> 03:19:08.072]  I don't know if they just shut some things down to put something in and fire it back.
[03:19:08.152 --> 03:19:08.772]  You know what I'm saying?
[03:19:09.472 --> 03:19:10.512]  How does this happen?
[03:19:11.393 --> 03:19:13.353]  Like Cypress and other things, like you warned us.
[03:19:14.076 --> 03:19:19.560]  And now I was putting my wife out of the blue, saying, man, we got all these weird posts, this NSF charges, and people have their money.
[03:19:19.580 --> 03:19:21.502]  So, you know.
[03:19:21.762 --> 03:19:22.603]  Yeah, that's what's happening.
[03:19:22.623 --> 03:19:24.204]  And here's an example, like flash trading.
[03:19:24.224 --> 03:19:30.389]  They hook computers in right there at the stock exchange that just steal money by doing these flash trades that they control.
[03:19:30.770 --> 03:19:31.430]  Total fraud.
[03:19:31.870 --> 03:19:33.352]  And then, yes, that's the new move.
[03:19:33.372 --> 03:19:35.654]  They're getting all the laws changed, or regulations.
[03:19:36.414 --> 03:19:37.094]  Totally illegal.
[03:19:37.854 --> 03:19:40.175]  Quietly, to just start taking your money.
[03:19:40.215 --> 03:19:54.037]  But the word is, and I've been told this for several years it's been happening, they will grab money out of your account only for a few hours, but they'll do this to hundreds of millions of accounts worldwide, pool it, make deals with that money, and then put it back in your account.
[03:19:54.557 --> 03:20:03.159]  So, again, it's all digital, it's all fraud, and, I mean, what type of weird, there's just weird fees, weird, seeing stuff she's never seen before?
[03:20:04.051 --> 03:20:08.517]  Right, like we had money in there, but we had an NSF posting on our account.
[03:20:09.018 --> 03:20:10.240]  She goes, what in the world is that?
[03:20:10.300 --> 03:20:14.305]  So I'm just asking, or perhaps... Explain what an NSF posting is.
[03:20:14.446 --> 03:20:16.208]  Non-sufficient funds.
[03:20:16.909 --> 03:20:19.653]  Something tried to go through, but no money was there at the time.
[03:20:20.532 --> 03:20:23.794]  And so there's a charge, automatic, that nobody can do nothing about it.
[03:20:23.814 --> 03:20:26.935]  You have to manually go in there and fix it if it was a big problem.
[03:20:26.955 --> 03:20:27.776]  Yeah, well, this is happening.
[03:20:27.796 --> 03:20:33.019]  Everybody I know, especially old people, because they've done actuaries, tests, and know that they're not as savvy.
[03:20:33.499 --> 03:20:41.103]  Every old person I know, on phone bills, cable bills, gas bills, credit cards, are being given fines and fees that aren't true.
[03:20:41.723 --> 03:20:43.484]  And they found most people just pay it.
[03:20:44.184 --> 03:20:47.046]  So it's just, it's like, look, it's a culture of evil.
[03:20:48.880 --> 03:20:50.001]  Send us intel on that.
[03:20:50.081 --> 03:20:51.862]  Send us show tips for other folks in banking.
[03:20:52.182 --> 03:20:53.423]  We'll try to get a story out on it.
[03:20:54.123 --> 03:20:56.784]  But again, thank you so much.
[03:20:57.104 --> 03:21:02.267]  This is what it's like, Mario Lopez here in studio with us, to live in a culture of evil.
[03:21:02.547 --> 03:21:04.148]  That's why third world countries can't operate.
[03:21:04.468 --> 03:21:06.329]  Because it's just the systems corrupt.
[03:21:06.349 --> 03:21:07.129]  Everything collapses.
[03:21:07.830 --> 03:21:11.972]  Yeah, it's like back on that bill thing, I've had a
[03:21:13.021 --> 03:21:18.225]  Uh, AT&T, uh, multiple times, I call them up and I'm like, hey, what's, what's up with this bill?
[03:21:18.245 --> 03:21:19.987]  You know, I'm like, oh, it's, it's nothing.
[03:21:20.967 --> 03:21:23.870]  Uh, uh, uh, uh, sorry about that.
[03:21:23.890 --> 03:21:25.671]  We'll give you a month free, you know?
[03:21:25.951 --> 03:21:30.075]  And, and I'm like, well, if, uh, if I didn't call, I would have paid that.
[03:21:30.635 --> 03:21:34.738]  And you just swept it on the rug and nothing, didn't say anything about it.
[03:21:34.758 --> 03:21:40.443]  So yeah, they- Almost everyone I know now pays tickets and then they still put a warrant out and come and arrest you.
[03:21:41.224 --> 03:21:41.404]  Oh, wow.
[03:21:42.879 --> 03:21:44.840]  I mean, it's just totally collapsing.
[03:21:45.040 --> 03:21:45.660]  They just don't care.
[03:21:45.680 --> 03:21:46.240]  It's all funny.
[03:21:47.781 --> 03:21:49.582]  I'm telling you, society is just going to start unraveling.
[03:21:50.122 --> 03:21:51.283]  It's never been this complex.
[03:21:51.343 --> 03:21:52.203]  It's going to unravel.
[03:21:52.783 --> 03:21:53.764]  They're going to make it unravel.
[03:21:54.064 --> 03:21:55.644]  Travis in Washington, you're on the air.
[03:21:55.724 --> 03:21:56.125]  Go ahead.
[03:21:56.945 --> 03:21:58.385]  Hey, I got a couple things.
[03:21:58.746 --> 03:22:06.629]  Mr. Lopez, your aliens you're talking about were the ones that left their first estate that were supposed to report back to God and watch over the people on this earth.
[03:22:07.617 --> 03:22:11.040]  They were also the gods of Olympus, the mythical gods.
[03:22:11.380 --> 03:22:13.142]  And that's all I got to say about that subject.
[03:22:13.202 --> 03:22:17.565]  I called in about the new cell phone spy network.
[03:22:18.026 --> 03:22:18.686]  Are you guys still there?
[03:22:19.026 --> 03:22:19.267]  Yes.
[03:22:20.588 --> 03:22:23.530]  Okay, it's not just for surveillance, Alex.
[03:22:24.291 --> 03:22:28.814]  You've seen the conspiracy theory with Jesse Ventura when he was up talking to Nick Begich.
[03:22:29.055 --> 03:22:30.736]  He put the suction cup on his forehead.
[03:22:32.152 --> 03:22:39.897]  Sure enough, they're putting in soft drink machines all over the world that beam audio directly into your brain, yeah.
[03:22:53.151 --> 03:22:54.031]  You know, that is the thing.
[03:22:54.051 --> 03:23:00.493]  This whole system, DARPA admits they've been developing systems to manipulate us and make us submit smart meters, all of it.
[03:23:00.833 --> 03:23:03.034]  I mean, we're living in a science fiction movie, Mario.
[03:23:05.275 --> 03:23:05.415]  Yep.
[03:23:06.855 --> 03:23:09.036]  No flesh would be spared if God didn't intervene.
[03:23:12.837 --> 03:23:14.918]  Let's take a call from Alex in Missouri.
[03:23:14.938 --> 03:23:15.398]  You're on the air.
[03:23:15.478 --> 03:23:15.998]  Thanks for holding.
[03:23:17.058 --> 03:23:18.839]  Gentlemen, thank you both for your time.
[03:23:18.899 --> 03:23:19.599]  Mario, thank you.
[03:23:23.919 --> 03:23:25.240]  We're good to go.
[03:23:54.047 --> 03:24:01.673]  She's now in the fight of her life with chronic headaches, nausea, gymnastics.
[03:24:02.373 --> 03:24:07.136]  They're saying fibromyalgia.
[03:24:07.557 --> 03:24:13.841]  On record, it sterilizes a lot of people, reduces fertility by a minimum, causes autoimmune disorder, and it is a bioweapon.
[03:24:13.901 --> 03:24:22.527]  And they're testing, can we give somebody something that killed a bunch of people in the trials, and then test and see, because the government gives them immunity where they can't be sued.
[03:24:23.047 --> 03:24:23.347]  I don't
[03:24:41.331 --> 03:24:42.252]  I don't
[03:25:02.483 --> 03:25:04.223]  And it's usually the second or third shot.
[03:25:04.623 --> 03:25:07.604]  And some people go in again and give them the third shot, and their daughter dies.
[03:25:07.644 --> 03:25:11.005]  They are so committed to those doctors, they actually kill their daughter.
[03:25:11.565 --> 03:25:17.906]  Now, in the old times, in Tyre, on the Mediterranean, they would throw a child into a burning pit.
[03:25:18.266 --> 03:25:22.087]  That was a loving way to sacrifice them to Satan, compared to this.
[03:25:22.707 --> 03:25:23.967]  This is slow death.
[03:25:25.467 --> 03:25:27.247]  Your comments on talking about Gardasil.
[03:25:27.488 --> 03:25:29.788]  It doesn't even protect you from cancer or the warts, by the way.
[03:25:31.351 --> 03:25:33.432]  I don't know, I don't really know too much about that.
[03:25:35.453 --> 03:25:41.557]  My kids were vaccinated, you know, normally, and they're fine, thank God.
[03:25:42.397 --> 03:25:45.699]  But it's just, yeah, they're just getting away with it.
[03:25:46.179 --> 03:25:47.540]  They haven't taken Gardasil, have they?
[03:25:48.060 --> 03:25:48.761]  I don't have no idea.
[03:25:48.781 --> 03:25:49.861]  Well, they're going to push that on you.
[03:25:49.901 --> 03:25:50.602]  Just look into it.
[03:25:50.902 --> 03:25:51.122]  Okay.
[03:25:51.402 --> 03:25:53.123]  Believe me, if it wasn't true, they'd be suing me.
[03:25:53.163 --> 03:25:53.804]  I mean, look it up.
[03:25:54.844 --> 03:25:57.546]  Remember Rick Perry said it's the law and it wasn't the law, another hoax?
[03:25:58.763 --> 03:26:02.044]  Well, if you Google Tyler's story of vaccine injury, you can read everything that's going on with her.
[03:26:02.064 --> 03:26:04.085]  Chronic headaches, nausea, fatigue.
[03:26:04.105 --> 03:26:07.867]  Again, she was a gymnast and she can't even practice gymnastics anymore.
[03:26:27.534 --> 03:26:30.255]  I have a view, Alex, for us info warriors out there.
[03:26:30.835 --> 03:26:43.118]  You know, when we try to spread the word and let people know about vaccines, about FEMA camps, about the things that you are putting out into the world, we have to go do that research and look for those things ourselves.
[03:26:43.198 --> 03:26:46.599]  And maybe on your website you have a page, Info Warriors for Dummies.
[03:26:47.339 --> 03:26:50.020]  I've said this a million times and we're going to try to do it soon.
[03:26:50.040 --> 03:26:53.860]  We have data pages with all the facts, with all the stuff in one spot.
[03:26:53.900 --> 03:26:54.381]  God bless you.
[03:26:54.401 --> 03:26:55.421]  I appreciate you calling.
[03:26:56.341 --> 03:26:57.281]  And we're just out of time.
[03:26:57.301 --> 03:26:58.562]  We've got all these callers.
[03:26:58.702 --> 03:27:02.123]  We've got Max, and Zach, and Christy, and Alex, and everybody else.
[03:27:02.143 --> 03:27:04.183]  But I'm going to have to stop right there because we're out of time.
[03:27:04.603 --> 03:27:13.365]  And I wanted to plug one more time HowIKnow.org, paintingsbyMarioLopez.com, Army veteran Mario Lopez, fought in Afghanistan in 2008.
[03:27:13.785 --> 03:27:19.667]  He witnessed the dark side of the military before his engineering unit ran over an IED in Afghanistan, which left him badly injured.
[03:27:20.187 --> 03:27:24.208]  Anything else that you'd like to add for folks out there in the minute or two we have left?
[03:27:24.741 --> 03:27:47.279]  No, just again encourage pastors if you have a congregation and you have some young people in it to let them hear the other side of it before they end up just totally falling into the New World Order system and just the lies that they're being fed every day.
[03:27:48.360 --> 03:27:51.323]  These kids are going into battle at

[03:27:54.221 --> 03:27:58.383]  They're going into a battle that should be fought with people that know.
[03:27:58.403 --> 03:28:12.409]  They're just a sponge just soaking up everything and we just need to just stop laying down and letting other people, letting Satan educate our children.

[03:28:38.630 --> 03:28:46.314]  Folks, every tweenie singer now is into Satanism on television, targeting girls under the age of 10.
[03:28:49.330 --> 03:28:55.444]  There is no doubt that we have just turned our children over to this, and I'm not on some high horse, but my goodness, protect their innocence.
[03:28:56.542 --> 03:29:00.483]  Realize that the globalists hate you, they hate your family, they hate us all.

[03:29:11.325 --> 03:29:17.206]  They know in the major studies, Harvard studies about lesions in the brain from not having iodine and having fluoride instead.
[03:29:17.246 --> 03:29:17.866]  They know this.
[03:29:18.386 --> 03:29:20.706]  They don't tell pregnant women about quality iodine.
[03:29:21.667 --> 03:29:22.947]  They took the iodine out of the salt.
[03:29:24.008 --> 03:29:25.409]  They don't want you to know about this stuff.
[03:29:25.449 --> 03:29:27.071]  The people perish for lack of knowledge.
