[00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:07.046]  You're listening to GCN, the world leader in independent talk radio.
[00:00:14.195 --> 00:00:18.379]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:19.840]  You want answers?
[00:00:20.621 --> 00:00:21.522]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.163 --> 00:00:25.806]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:30.430]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:43.991 --> 00:00:48.095]  Vladimir Putin yesterday warned of a civil war in Egypt.
[00:00:48.975 --> 00:00:51.618]  I think you're already seeing a civil war in Egypt.
[00:00:52.358 --> 00:00:59.144]  All part of the globalist on-record strategy of tension, balkanization, destabilization global program.
[00:01:00.705 --> 00:01:04.649]  That's what they have in store for the United States many years down the road.
[00:01:04.669 --> 00:01:09.873]  But places like Egypt are a little bit further along in the New World Order plan.
[00:01:10.796 --> 00:01:17.098]  We're going to be looking at that on this Monday, the 8th day of July 2013, Global Transmission.
[00:01:17.138 --> 00:01:38.144]  Larry Pratt will be joining us at the start of the next hour for 30 minutes, the head of Gun Owners of America, to look at some of the new fast and furious type scandals that have broke in the back of the newspaper, but have not gotten a lot of attention, and the state of the anti-gunners, extrajudicial, outside of the law, UN treaty operations.
[00:01:39.926 --> 00:01:42.788]  Because Obama says he doesn't care if the Senate doesn't ratify it.
[00:01:43.428 --> 00:01:44.529]  He's going to implement it.
[00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:48.772]  So we'll be looking at that coming up in the second hour.
[00:01:49.312 --> 00:01:51.994]  Adam Kokesh is going to pop in for about 10-15 minutes.
[00:01:52.994 --> 00:01:53.995]  I haven't talked to him yet.
[00:01:54.555 --> 00:01:55.856]  He said he's been off the radar.
[00:01:57.808 --> 00:01:58.329]  I think so.
[00:02:16.284 --> 00:02:18.886]  follower of terrorists like George Washington.
[00:02:19.346 --> 00:02:21.849]  Very extreme, very evil, very bad.
[00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:31.738]  He also thinks that you have a Fourth Amendment, a Tenth Amendment, and should not have police all over the country now doing proctology exams on people on the side of the road.
[00:02:32.138 --> 00:02:38.044]  A new video emerged over the weekend that I watched this morning of Texas women again with
[00:02:41.277 --> 00:02:50.462]  Police, male police on top of it, doing cavity searches and just just unprecedented and it shows how whacked out government's gotten.
[00:02:51.263 --> 00:03:00.468]  By the way, the government is on record, as I've said 50 trillion times and as you know, shipping the drugs into the country.
[00:03:00.488 --> 00:03:07.853]  These women were coming back from the beach to Houston in their bikinis, two friends, actually two cousins, and well,
[00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.991]  Some will say, well, it's because they're black this happened.
[00:03:11.071 --> 00:03:11.391]  I don't know.
[00:03:11.431 --> 00:03:15.354]  I've seen footage of blondes, brunettes, white, Hispanic, black.
[00:03:15.894 --> 00:03:19.216]  Seems to be women, though, and they just tell them, get a bend over the hood!
[00:03:20.537 --> 00:03:24.779]  And you can have multiple women, same glove, just a total assault in my view.
[00:03:26.641 --> 00:03:28.202]  But it's the officer's order!
[00:03:28.222 --> 00:03:31.203]  I'll order you out of your house!
[00:03:31.564 --> 00:03:33.925]  We're going to use your house to surveil your neighbors!
[00:03:34.886 --> 00:03:36.206]  I order you!
[00:03:36.487 --> 00:03:36.887]  I order!
[00:03:38.882 --> 00:03:42.263]  Who needs to get to the pearly gates to become an angelic being?
[00:03:42.283 --> 00:03:45.744]  You become God the moment you put on the uniform under the New World Order.
[00:03:46.004 --> 00:03:49.525]  They're God in North Korea, the police are God in Mexico.
[00:03:49.545 --> 00:03:54.267]  Of course, the countries rot into the ground once there's no due process, but so what?
[00:03:54.927 --> 00:03:55.307]  So what?
[00:03:55.407 --> 00:03:57.728]  Every metric shows America rotting into the ground.
[00:03:57.748 --> 00:04:03.109]  It's all part of the same orgy we've seen thousands of times in different nations in history.
[00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:04.830]  When the tyrants take over,
[00:04:06.138 --> 00:04:08.100]  The decadent population submits.
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:15.745]  I mean, this is happening because we do have a slovenly, arrogant, self-centered, thuggish population as well.
[00:04:16.026 --> 00:04:22.190]  Not everybody, but in general, it's a rotting society with no self-respect.
[00:04:23.131 --> 00:04:26.093]  In fact, a San Francisco Flight 77 crash.
[00:04:27.294 --> 00:04:30.257]  Why did so many passengers evacuate with their bags, Forbes asks.
[00:04:30.637 --> 00:04:32.758]  Well, they should be asking what's buried in the article.
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.841]  Why did they not help the children?
[00:04:37.383 --> 00:04:44.506]  People left kids on board and went for their bags.
[00:04:44.526 --> 00:04:47.247]  Let me tell you, I'm in an airplane and it's blowing up on fire?
[00:04:48.207 --> 00:04:49.628]  Forget my clothes.
[00:04:51.448 --> 00:04:54.189]  You know, your dirty underwear or whatever.
[00:04:54.269 --> 00:04:59.872]  I mean, it's just the minion-ness of the whole world's population.
[00:05:00.332 --> 00:05:03.053]  Just trundling along and the cop says, bend over!
[00:05:04.441 --> 00:05:08.904]  I'm telling you, the new American flag should be somebody bent over with a cop doing a proctology exam.
[00:05:09.844 --> 00:05:12.966]  Oklahoma reminds us there are many kinds of storms in our lives.
[00:05:13.306 --> 00:05:15.948]  Nature regularly sends us destructive storms.
[00:05:15.968 --> 00:05:18.910]  24 hours before a storm strikes, people panic.
[00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.392]  It would be wise to prepare ahead of the panic curve.
[00:05:22.632 --> 00:05:28.876]  The food price storm, from drought and livestock problems, is forecast to hit ridiculous heights by the end of the summer.
[00:05:29.156 --> 00:05:30.818]  Wonder if there'll really be a problem?

[00:08:30.386 --> 00:08:34.536]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:36.889 --> 00:08:42.571]  You have found it, my friends, the tip of the spear, the front lines in the fight to awaken humanity.
[00:08:43.251 --> 00:08:46.872]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and we'll be here for the next three hours today.
[00:08:47.372 --> 00:08:49.773]  Larry Pratt with huge updates on the U.N.
[00:08:49.793 --> 00:08:55.815]  gun treaty, new Fast and Furious-type scandals, you name it, coming up for about half of the next hour.
[00:08:55.855 --> 00:09:00.637]  Then we'll have open phones until Adam Kokesh joins us for the last 20 minutes of the broadcast or so.
[00:09:00.697 --> 00:09:02.737]  He locked and loaded in D.C.
[00:09:02.777 --> 00:09:04.238]  in defiance of their tyranny.
[00:09:04.878 --> 00:09:23.090]  And regardless of what you think of his activities in other arenas, you've got to admire the courage of this modern Rosa Parks, I'm-not-sitting-at-the-back-of-the-bus type activity against these control freak, miscreant criminals that have hijacked our nation.
[00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:27.913]  Speaking of that, there's a new Gallup poll out, and I think it's much higher than this.
[00:09:27.933 --> 00:09:34.598]  71% agree founding fathers would be ashamed of country today, and they're right.
[00:09:35.499 --> 00:09:46.029]  Well, the police are trained, and we show this video in my film Road to Tyranny, and we've shown countless training manuals, they're actually told the Founding Fathers were bad people.
[00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:57.781]  Then they swear an oath to a Constitution, because that's law, and to uphold it, and then they are told anyone that makes frequent references to the Constitution
[00:09:58.986 --> 00:10:00.407]  Go ahead and put them in a terrorist file.
[00:10:00.828 --> 00:10:02.269]  That's in the FBI training manuals.
[00:10:02.329 --> 00:10:10.696]  Just type in constitutional terrorist and you'll see, let's not exaggerate, over a hundred manuals of the FBI put out in the last 15 years that are public.
[00:10:10.936 --> 00:10:11.937]  These are on their website.
[00:10:12.578 --> 00:10:16.181]  They've got over a hundred current ones for every business there is.
[00:10:17.602 --> 00:10:22.146]  Tattoo parlors, barber shops, bars, car washes.
[00:10:22.867 --> 00:10:25.149]  Is somebody talking about the founding fathers and freedom?
[00:10:26.104 --> 00:10:27.545]  Give the police a call!
[00:10:28.566 --> 00:10:31.448]  Imagine, you know, red dawn if the Soviets had taken over in the 80s.
[00:10:31.869 --> 00:10:36.833]  If you hear American pigs speaking of founding fathers of freedom, report them immediately!
[00:10:36.853 --> 00:10:40.556]  I mean, this is how bizarro it's gotten.
[00:10:42.498 --> 00:10:44.759]  So we're going to be breaking all of that down.
[00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:47.061]  Also, some good news.
[00:10:47.322 --> 00:10:50.284]  A train wreck of Obamacare begins to unravel.
[00:10:50.804 --> 00:10:54.107]  Massive government boondoggles set to self-destruct by 2015.
[00:10:56.032 --> 00:10:58.315]  Well, it's all written to be selectively enforced.
[00:10:59.095 --> 00:11:03.861]  But if you resist it, it's so nakedly unconstitutional, it will be defeated.
[00:11:04.441 --> 00:11:15.334]  It is a tax, as the Supreme Court ruled, to private offshore banks that own the big insurance companies, to make you purchase insurance.
[00:11:16.738 --> 00:11:19.639]  Now what happens when you've got to buy something?
[00:11:20.439 --> 00:11:22.880]  You've got to buy textbooks to go to college.
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.201]  That's why the average textbook cost over $200.
[00:11:25.301 --> 00:11:30.683]  When a similar book at Barnes & Noble would cost $20.
[00:11:32.466 --> 00:11:41.189]  They've got all sorts of military textbooks and big, thick publications that are even better than the Soviet-style bilge that you pay for.
[00:11:41.209 --> 00:11:46.090]  I see some textbooks that are $500 now that you've got to have.
[00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:50.872]  A $500 outdated, crud-filled piece of garbage.
[00:11:51.312 --> 00:11:52.192]  Well, it's the same thing.
[00:11:52.512 --> 00:11:53.973]  You've got to buy
[00:11:54.733 --> 00:11:56.575]  Car insurance, so it goes up and up and up.
[00:11:56.815 --> 00:12:05.524]  And after that unconstitutional president said, well, you've got to buy health insurance, and now you've got to buy in California gun insurance if the governor signs it.
[00:12:05.984 --> 00:12:08.066]  Oh, and insurance to buy ammo.
[00:12:08.247 --> 00:12:13.572]  And oh, lo and behold, once they turn a right into a privilege, they can outlaw it.
[00:12:16.912 --> 00:12:40.118]  So we're going to be going over all of that news, and this is, well, Mother tells how she was strapped down while prison doctors persuaded her to be sterilized, and they put it in persuaded, that's in quotes, they strapped her down and forced her, as nearly 250 Californian inmates were pressured into surgery.
[00:12:40.719 --> 00:12:41.799]  That's just who they know about.
[00:12:43.582 --> 00:12:47.925]  Rising the specter of California's dark eugenics history.
[00:12:49.286 --> 00:12:55.071]  And then people argue, well, we shouldn't have these prison inmates being able to have kids again.
[00:12:55.091 --> 00:12:58.854]  Oh, they're going to end up sterilizing you when you go on welfare.
[00:12:59.628 --> 00:13:02.631]  Which, and then people say, well that's a good idea, there's too many poor people having kids.
[00:13:02.971 --> 00:13:13.060]  That's the plan, is to totally break down society and then bring in Orwellian control that is not going to even be targeted on the giant masses of poor people.
[00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:13.721]  It never is.
[00:13:14.121 --> 00:13:16.904]  It's going to be targeted on middle class.
[00:13:17.044 --> 00:13:17.865]  We're the enemy.
[00:13:18.145 --> 00:13:19.546]  I don't care what color you are.
[00:13:20.447 --> 00:13:23.930]  If you want to be self-sufficient and outside of their cult, they're coming after you.
[00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:27.053]  And speaking of that, here's a CNS News story.
[00:13:27.113 --> 00:13:29.034]  It's up on Drudge and on InfoWars.
[00:13:29.354 --> 00:13:32.177]  InfoWars.com and up on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:13:36.952 --> 00:13:44.576]  101 million Americans get food aid from federal government more than the number of private sector workers.
[00:13:44.836 --> 00:13:50.319]  Here, I'll move over the box so we can actually show TV viewers this.
[00:13:50.819 --> 00:13:55.302]  Or you guys can just go and punch it up on your computer and show people.
[00:13:55.982 --> 00:14:03.927]  Since we put new computers in here, it's very hard for me to put stuff on screen without it being cut off, and I want to rectify, and I bet we can figure out a plan to do that.
[00:14:03.947 --> 00:14:13.493]  101 million Americans get food aid from federal government more than the number of private sector workers.
[00:14:16.675 --> 00:14:18.396]  That's why it's going to be game over soon.
[00:14:19.167 --> 00:14:22.290]  Unless we just start non-complying with everything.
[00:14:22.691 --> 00:14:37.866]  Because they've got a giant mass of drooling fluoride heads who have been chemically lobotomized, who are living off the dole and don't even know what country they're in, what state, what the three branches of governments are in some cases.
[00:14:38.286 --> 00:14:40.809]  They don't know their head from a hole in the ground.
[00:14:42.605 --> 00:14:51.350]  That's why all over the country cops are pulling people over, mainly women, for speeding or for a burnout taillight and saying, alright, get up against the car.
[00:14:52.071 --> 00:14:59.555]  And we're such animals to the government now, they don't even change gloves when, according to jurisprudence and common law, it is a rape.
[00:15:00.646 --> 00:15:07.176]  To stick your hands in someone's pants and put your body, put your hand into their body.
[00:15:07.737 --> 00:15:12.143]  Two women, you've seen that famous video, a blonde and a brunette, both white.
[00:15:12.724 --> 00:15:15.648]  Two women, outside Dallas, state police.
[00:15:17.213 --> 00:15:18.593]  And now more videos are coming out.
[00:15:18.633 --> 00:15:19.654]  It's, by the way, continuing.
[00:15:19.674 --> 00:15:20.394]  They're not stopping.
[00:15:21.094 --> 00:15:23.575]  And they just pull you over and say, all right, I'm gonna go ahead and search your car.
[00:15:23.755 --> 00:15:28.576]  They don't even ask permission, like the old days, to trick you into letting them violate your Fourth Amendment.
[00:15:29.016 --> 00:15:31.017]  The sheep don't know what planet they're on.
[00:15:31.257 --> 00:15:31.957]  They get out.
[00:15:32.337 --> 00:15:33.618]  They comply with everything.
[00:15:34.398 --> 00:15:35.418]  Unconstitutionally.
[00:15:35.799 --> 00:15:39.980]  And so of course it's, all right, now I'm going to wear the same glove.
[00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.341]  It'd be illegal if they change gloves.
[00:15:42.381 --> 00:15:49.103]  But it's serious assault when it's the same glove and the female officer, but now they're using male officers.
[00:15:49.143 --> 00:15:49.503]  Why not?
[00:15:49.543 --> 00:15:50.544]  The slaves will put up with it.
[00:15:52.544 --> 00:16:02.388]  Going inside one woman's, well it's one, it's one glove, four orifices.
[00:16:04.978 --> 00:16:06.060]  One glove, two women.
[00:16:06.982 --> 00:16:08.164]  Two girls, one glove.
[00:16:09.106 --> 00:16:10.348]  And this is how it works.
[00:16:10.448 --> 00:16:13.654]  And listen, next it's going to be your kids like TSA.
[00:16:13.855 --> 00:16:15.097]  We're going down the pants of kids.
[00:16:15.438 --> 00:16:16.960]  Thousands of photos and videos.
[00:16:19.209 --> 00:16:22.612]  There was a big backlash, they pulled back for a little while, now they're back doing it again.
[00:16:22.932 --> 00:16:27.416]  And they're gonna pull you over, and they're gonna get your three-year-old out, and they're gonna ram their hand into them!
[00:16:27.636 --> 00:16:34.381]  And if you don't like it, they're gonna line you up and taser you, and if you resist that, they're gonna shove a gun right in your head and splatter your brains all over the ground!
[00:16:34.562 --> 00:16:38.004]  Because that's how America, the cursed nation, is!
[00:16:39.045 --> 00:16:43.889]  If you'll kill 53 million babies and say they're not humans, well, why are you a human?
[00:16:46.992 --> 00:16:48.073]  And I love how
[00:16:51.431 --> 00:16:59.076]  They're always pushing this like it's for our own good.
[00:17:00.878 --> 00:17:02.959]  And how it's to stop drugs.
[00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:12.686]  Ladies and gentlemen, in case you didn't know, it's not a rumor that our ships were never attacked to get us into Vietnam and the Gulf of Tonkin.
[00:17:12.966 --> 00:17:13.687]  That came out in 64.
[00:17:14.787 --> 00:17:18.150]  The average person just heard the rumor, so it became a conspiracy theory.
[00:17:19.335 --> 00:17:20.856]  Now been completely declassified, 2004.
[00:17:24.178 --> 00:17:26.179]  It's a fact, all over the U.S.
[00:17:26.559 --> 00:17:29.260]  they sterilize foster children.
[00:17:29.561 --> 00:17:30.901]  They sterilize them here in Austin.
[00:17:32.022 --> 00:17:34.763]  And the doctors that have told me about it are like, but you don't tell anybody.
[00:17:35.324 --> 00:17:37.025]  Okay, you're a journalist, this is off record.
[00:17:37.785 --> 00:17:40.206]  They give the children in Austin cancer virus.
[00:17:41.607 --> 00:17:41.947]  Orally.
[00:17:42.588 --> 00:17:43.088]  Illegally.
[00:17:44.628 --> 00:17:47.451]  At these big public clinics at the sports stadiums in Zilker Park.
[00:17:48.011 --> 00:17:51.434]  And I've had a top doctor tell me this, but say, you go investigate it.
[00:17:51.674 --> 00:17:52.975]  You know, I don't want to be on the news.
[00:17:55.458 --> 00:17:57.319]  And we went and investigated it, and surely enough, it's true.
[00:17:57.339 --> 00:17:59.621]  And the health department said, we're not going to discuss that with you.
[00:17:59.861 --> 00:18:06.587]  They don't just take foster kids and tie their tubes or give the males vasectomies.
[00:18:07.308 --> 00:18:09.190]  They give them cancer.
[00:18:10.413 --> 00:18:17.118]  It may take them 30 years to get it, but they're giving them the cancer virus that implants in all of their major cell groups.
[00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:20.481]  And so that's what I'm talking about here.
[00:18:20.801 --> 00:18:24.184]  There's no making deals with the New World Order.
[00:18:24.364 --> 00:18:25.305]  There's no playing games.
[00:18:25.785 --> 00:18:28.768]  And the cops are just brainwashed zombies, just like the public.
[00:18:29.008 --> 00:18:34.813]  They believe they have the authority, just like Nazis believe they have the authority to put people in sand pits and shoot them in the head.
[00:18:35.814 --> 00:18:40.097]  They believe they have the authority to pull you over and ram their hand into your body.
[00:18:41.779 --> 00:18:42.519]  And they're going to do it!
[00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:46.683]  And they're going to lose lawsuits and keep doing it, because the bankers want to bankrupt America.
[00:18:46.823 --> 00:18:48.104]  They hope they lose more lawsuits.
[00:18:48.124 --> 00:18:48.724]  They don't care.
[00:18:49.445 --> 00:18:51.567]  That's why they've been told, lose all the lawsuits you want.
[00:18:51.847 --> 00:18:52.888]  Drive them into submission.
[00:18:55.083 --> 00:18:58.664]  By the way, the Daily Mail says, oh, you know, not really.
[00:18:59.084 --> 00:18:59.904]  They were pressured.
[00:19:00.124 --> 00:19:08.287]  Actually, the News 10, ABC, out of California, female inmates sterilized in California prisons without approval.
[00:19:09.207 --> 00:19:11.287]  So, you know, the Daily Mail's kind of whitewashing it.
[00:19:11.567 --> 00:19:14.888]  Actually, they forced these women to do it, and they took them and tied them down.
[00:19:17.209 --> 00:19:18.209]  They've always done that.
[00:19:18.869 --> 00:19:21.250]  And again, the argument here is, well, there's too many people.
[00:19:22.745 --> 00:19:33.197]  The point is, ladies and gentlemen, they've picked a plastic system out of thousands of formulas that has estrogen in it to feminize men and hyper-feminize women.
[00:19:33.637 --> 00:19:35.019]  Women are like, good, I'll be hyper-feminine.
[00:19:35.059 --> 00:19:38.103]  Yeah, all of your sexual tissues will hyper-age.
[00:19:39.424 --> 00:19:40.005]  You will die.
[00:19:42.742 --> 00:19:48.226]  But again, 101 million Americans get food aid from federal government, more than the number of private sector workers.
[00:19:48.546 --> 00:19:49.347]  And it's growing.
[00:19:49.607 --> 00:19:51.148]  That's why they're de-industrializing.
[00:19:51.389 --> 00:20:03.698]  That's why they're putting regulations on independent businesses that could give people jobs, to make it too hard, so that everybody just goes and watches Oprah, and Obama, and just drinks their fluoride, and goes quietly into the night.
[00:20:04.158 --> 00:20:07.721]  Now we're gonna look at Egypt, and a lot of other key news straight ahead, stay with us.

[00:21:14.639 --> 00:21:20.321]  Maser Instruments detect all forms of nuclear radiation, including alpha, beta, gamma, and x-rays.
[00:21:20.401 --> 00:21:21.541]  And there always are.

[00:21:22.842 --> 00:21:25.622]  Detecting, measuring, and monitoring nuclear radiation.
[00:21:25.743 --> 00:21:26.603]  Made in America.

[00:21:39.602 --> 00:21:40.623]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:40.703 --> 00:21:45.026]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:21:45.186 --> 00:21:50.811]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:21:50.911 --> 00:21:54.254]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:21:54.494 --> 00:21:57.056]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:57.156 --> 00:22:01.980]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.

[00:24:48.662 --> 00:24:56.747]  Coming up in the next segment, I will not just take your calls, I will elaborate on the Egypt situation.
[00:24:56.767 --> 00:24:58.048]  I'm going to get to some of that in a moment.
[00:24:58.388 --> 00:25:03.872]  But I want to finish up talking about our society, talking about the cultural trends
[00:25:05.506 --> 00:25:07.107]  These are not just my observations.
[00:25:07.627 --> 00:25:25.319]  I go off of the sociological numbers that you hear us here breaking down every day, and my own experiences in life, where I will see more and more people act like selfish, stupid, evil, greedy demons.
[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:29.041]  And that's why the police are getting worse and worse.
[00:25:29.861 --> 00:25:32.043]  It's because they are a reflection of the public as well.
[00:25:33.689 --> 00:25:37.330]  Our government is a reflection of what we've become.
[00:25:38.451 --> 00:25:40.692]  Now, there are giant groups of good people.
[00:25:40.792 --> 00:25:56.418]  I would say more than half the population, generally, are hard-working, good, decent people who are criminally naive and simple-minded, and at their base, cowardly.
[00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:03.143]  And I would call the cowardice more of an excuse of, oh, I don't want to be out front.
[00:26:03.223 --> 00:26:04.284]  I don't want to be arrogant.
[00:26:04.684 --> 00:26:07.446]  I don't want to force myself into public view.
[00:26:08.107 --> 00:26:09.808]  I'm just going to put my head down.
[00:26:10.869 --> 00:26:12.670]  And, you know, that's a manly thing to do.
[00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:17.854]  No, what that is, is insanely cowardly and is the road to absolute enslavement.
[00:26:19.135 --> 00:26:19.755]  That's what it's called.
[00:26:24.784 --> 00:26:26.165]  I get being a quiet person.
[00:26:26.185 --> 00:26:28.926]  I get leaving people alone, minding your business.
[00:26:28.986 --> 00:26:29.967]  I do that with individuals.
[00:26:30.947 --> 00:26:40.472]  But when it comes to organized corporations, or organized government, or gangs of people, I instinctively get very angry and very aggressive.
[00:26:42.093 --> 00:26:43.414]  One time I had drag rats.
[00:26:44.514 --> 00:26:45.575]  Tommy Pallotta was with me.
[00:26:46.547 --> 00:26:52.488]  We were downtown having a business meeting, filmmaker, and we walk out and these drag rats aren't like your normal homeless people.
[00:26:52.508 --> 00:26:58.269]  They're not all bad, but large groups of them have raped people, beat people up, all sorts of stuff.
[00:26:58.729 --> 00:26:59.930]  There's been a lot of cases of it.
[00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:00.950]  There's even been deaths.
[00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:06.991]  And I walked out and eight or nine of them said, you know, basically, hey, you know, give me some money.
[00:27:08.892 --> 00:27:10.832]  And I turned around to them and I said, oh, really?
[00:27:10.872 --> 00:27:11.532]  Give you some money?
[00:27:12.472 --> 00:27:12.852]  What do you mean?
[00:27:12.892 --> 00:27:15.513]  They said, well, it'd be good for you to give us money, if you know what I mean.
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:17.841]  And I said, no, what do you mean?
[00:27:17.881 --> 00:27:19.022]  Well, if you know what's good for you.
[00:27:19.363 --> 00:27:23.347]  And I said, why don't you all get up and I'm going to stomp your heads into the ground right now.
[00:27:24.388 --> 00:27:25.469]  And I couldn't help it, folks.
[00:27:25.609 --> 00:27:28.151]  I mean, I was ready to stomp them into the ground.
[00:27:29.025 --> 00:27:32.067]  And again, I grew up in Dallas getting in a lot of fights.
[00:27:32.128 --> 00:27:36.191]  The few times I wasn't in the right in a fight, I'd get my butt kicked because I couldn't get up.
[00:27:36.911 --> 00:27:40.174]  If the fight was 50-50, I couldn't even swing a punch.
[00:27:40.214 --> 00:27:41.235]  I couldn't even get upset.
[00:27:41.295 --> 00:27:42.036]  I had no energy.
[00:27:42.356 --> 00:27:50.923]  It was only when somebody was in the wrong, somebody trying to mug me in a parking lot, a group of people trying to assault me that I would turn into absolute King Kong on PCP.
[00:27:55.345 --> 00:28:00.203]  Because instinctively, I get completely angry, and of course they backed off at that point.
[00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:13.603]  And it wasn't that I'm Mr. Tough Guy, it's that eight or nine people who I know have a history of abusing and raping and grabbing women off their bicycles and robbing them, I wanted to stomp their guts into the ground.
[00:28:13.884 --> 00:28:29.909]  And the reason they didn't take the fight was they figured out, even though they might have won in the end, because I've had my leg broken and stuff like that, fighting a big group of people, five guys, the whole issue is that they knew to back off because they knew they weren't going to get the money out of my wallet easy.
[00:28:30.765 --> 00:28:32.126]  There was going to be a price to pay.
[00:28:32.666 --> 00:28:37.188]  And that is the difference between a free society and a slave society.
[00:28:37.488 --> 00:28:41.489]  Bending over, literally on the side of the highway now, all over the country.
[00:28:41.710 --> 00:28:48.552]  But sadly, my own state is so whacked out that all over the country, cops are taking money out of old ladies' wallets.
[00:28:48.713 --> 00:28:49.613]  How much money you got in there?
[00:28:50.033 --> 00:28:51.714]  Well, I've got $2,000, sonny.
[00:28:51.774 --> 00:28:52.554]  I carry it with me.
[00:28:52.894 --> 00:28:53.234]  Boom!
[00:28:53.294 --> 00:28:53.775]  They take it.
[00:28:54.375 --> 00:28:55.795]  There's no law saying they can do that.
[00:28:56.196 --> 00:28:59.177]  They claim it's a forfeiture on site with no proof of drugs.
[00:29:01.346 --> 00:29:03.668]  And a lot of these cops aren't even conscious criminals.
[00:29:03.688 --> 00:29:13.255]  They're so whacked out, the local judge has told them to do it, and then it turns out the local judge is the one getting the money and living in some million-dollar house.
[00:29:13.295 --> 00:29:16.658]  I mean, it is un... And I'm talking about real cases I just mentioned there.
[00:29:16.898 --> 00:29:17.879]  A composite of several.
[00:29:18.119 --> 00:29:19.400]  A Tennessee and Texas case.
[00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:20.461]  Indiana does it.
[00:29:20.741 --> 00:29:21.862]  Louisiana is horrible.
[00:29:23.932 --> 00:29:25.574]  On record, shaking people down.
[00:29:26.455 --> 00:29:29.318]  And when you put up with it, it's what allows it to get worse.
[00:29:29.418 --> 00:29:32.761]  Standing up to it is what puts it back in the box.
[00:29:32.901 --> 00:29:36.164]  And when I come back, I want to talk about the thug culture.
[00:29:38.767 --> 00:29:41.850]  The oppressor culture versus the jellyfish culture.
[00:29:42.170 --> 00:29:43.612]  And tie it into San Francisco 7-7-7 crash.
[00:29:46.434 --> 00:29:50.577]  The passengers left even their own children, it's being reported, and didn't help them.
[00:29:50.937 --> 00:29:52.418]  They would go to get their bags.
[00:29:53.238 --> 00:29:54.639]  I mean, give me a break!
[00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:56.640]  Give me a break!
[00:29:58.902 --> 00:29:59.782]  We're on the march.
[00:30:00.282 --> 00:30:01.883]  The Empire's on the run.

[00:32:13.484 --> 00:32:14.425]  Tyranny is here.
[00:32:14.745 --> 00:32:18.287]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:32:18.687 --> 00:32:20.889]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:32:21.089 --> 00:32:26.372]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:32:26.772 --> 00:32:33.056]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:32:33.456 --> 00:32:39.019]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:43.102]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:32:43.602 --> 00:32:47.563]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:32:47.883 --> 00:32:53.385]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:32:53.825 --> 00:32:56.806]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:32:57.387 --> 00:32:58.787]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:32:59.347 --> 00:32:59.867]  It's here.
[00:33:00.488 --> 00:33:07.270]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:27.641]  A new world order.
[00:33:31.064 --> 00:33:34.447]  I say give Obama 20 peace prizes and Bush 100!
[00:33:34.587 --> 00:33:39.831]  On the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:41.212 --> 00:33:45.075]  What we are looking at is good and evil, right and wrong.
[00:33:45.195 --> 00:33:47.117]  A new world order.
[00:33:52.864 --> 00:33:56.806]  By the way, I didn't mean to flash back and start talking about getting in fights with homeless people.
[00:33:58.287 --> 00:34:10.614]  But all over the country there's the phenomenon of runaways, of young people who then are usually led by like a 25, 30 year old, and they're involved in a lot of crime, and Austin is infested with these people.
[00:34:11.255 --> 00:34:14.017]  Some of them are actually nice and are like nomadic groups.
[00:34:14.377 --> 00:34:16.238]  They then get fed on by the criminal groups.
[00:34:16.798 --> 00:34:19.380]  And my point is, is that the instinct of good people
[00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:21.781]  should be to stand up to groups like that.
[00:34:22.101 --> 00:34:38.128]  And so when I see government as a giant gang and the IRS running around robbing people without due process in an unconstitutional tax, but even within the confines of people that have paid being robbed and having their homes and wedding rings stolen.
[00:34:38.948 --> 00:34:43.310]  The horror stories are literally legion upon legion upon legion.
[00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:47.792]  That's being run by the Congress, by the President, by the central government.
[00:34:48.953 --> 00:34:52.937]  We act like the TSA is some bad agency, or the IRS, or the NSA.
[00:34:53.217 --> 00:34:54.878]  This is all part of a plan.
[00:34:54.898 --> 00:35:01.464]  There's a reason the street lights are laid out in a certain way, and the street cameras are laid out in a certain way, and the street signs.
[00:35:01.565 --> 00:35:02.946]  It's an organized program.
[00:35:06.129 --> 00:35:07.190]  And most of it's secret.
[00:35:08.511 --> 00:35:11.734]  What we know about it is, is they're trying to change the genetic environment of the planet.
[00:35:12.759 --> 00:35:16.821]  Where it's artificial and you've got to go to them to even be able to have kids or have crops.
[00:35:17.541 --> 00:35:21.383]  And they're busy spraying aluminum dioxide, barium salts and other chemicals.
[00:35:21.403 --> 00:35:32.508]  I've got a story out today that are on record thousands of times in the metric worse than the old CFCs that were in spray bottles.
[00:35:33.629 --> 00:35:41.573]  Why is the government trying to destroy the ozone layer in a giant secret program that it's declassified they're doing the program
[00:35:42.443 --> 00:35:50.287]  And what they're spraying, last time I checked, $5 billion a year, Department of Energy alone, just to pay for the program in North America.
[00:35:51.647 --> 00:35:57.570]  These people operate like they're aliens from a trillion miles away, come here to destroy us.
[00:35:58.171 --> 00:36:00.712]  I'm not saying that's what they are, they might as well be that!
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:10.048]  Do you understand when I got up here and told you about our family pediatrician who had one of the biggest pediatrician outfits here in Austin?
[00:36:10.688 --> 00:36:12.591]  He recently sold it and retired.
[00:36:12.611 --> 00:36:13.712]  I'm not going to say anymore.
[00:36:14.212 --> 00:36:18.858]  Grabbed me by the arm seven, eight years ago and saying, listen, you know these big free clinics they have?
[00:36:21.365 --> 00:36:22.626]  I listen to your show and it's true.
[00:36:22.967 --> 00:36:29.693]  He goes, guess what we were given, because doctors are supposed to volunteer, it's like compulsory volunteerism and they've got to go back to schooling and stuff.
[00:36:29.913 --> 00:36:31.114]  You're supposed to do so much volunteer time.
[00:36:31.354 --> 00:36:38.701]  So the doctors go to the big Zilker Park and sports stadiums, I don't know where I live, it happens in your area, and you might have 3,000 people come to get their shots.
[00:36:40.003 --> 00:36:46.529]  And he said, he looked at the dose vials, they were giving liquid, 1960s batch, totally illegal,
[00:36:49.264 --> 00:36:52.245]  Polio, live polio that had SV40 in it.
[00:36:52.926 --> 00:36:55.207]  A highly contagious cancer virus.
[00:36:56.347 --> 00:37:06.472]  That, you can pull up the government's own numbers, they believe contributed to over 100 million cancers just from the 50s through the 70s when it was made illegal.
[00:37:07.212 --> 00:37:12.495]  By the way, I see in the news all the time, they're still using those original batches to replicate it.
[00:37:13.638 --> 00:37:19.182]  And then they grow it on fetal tissue, they grow it on eggs, you name it, and they're shipping it to Africa, Asia, you name it.
[00:37:19.362 --> 00:37:24.026]  That's why all over the world they go, we don't want that in Pakistan and in Nigeria.
[00:37:24.806 --> 00:37:27.748]  They run from the white witch doctors and the UN witch doctors.
[00:37:28.149 --> 00:37:35.434]  Because folks, they used to run to the medicine man, now they run from the European or the EU or the UN medicine man.
[00:37:37.155 --> 00:37:40.598]  Simeon virus 40, SV40 polio vaccine fact sheet.
[00:37:41.621 --> 00:37:48.723]  It was discovered in 1960, that's the CDC's website, soon after the virus was found in the polio vaccine.
[00:37:49.183 --> 00:37:52.543]  And it says more than 98 million Americans received one or more dosages of it.
[00:37:52.683 --> 00:37:54.404]  Oh, isn't that sweet?
[00:37:54.424 --> 00:37:55.544]  By the way, they're still giving it.
[00:37:55.784 --> 00:37:59.145]  And they're still sterilizing people in every town and every city.
[00:37:59.405 --> 00:38:08.227]  And they're still putting poison in the water, hydrofluorosilicic acid, on record that wrecks your mind and wrecks your fertility.
[00:38:11.192 --> 00:38:13.833]  And people hear all this and you can go look it up and find out it's true.
[00:38:13.853 --> 00:38:18.156]  I mean, the crew's sitting in there just typing in whatever I say and pulling it up on the government's own websites.
[00:38:19.276 --> 00:38:20.577]  I'm not making any of this up.
[00:38:22.798 --> 00:38:30.902]  And that doctor had the courage to tell me, but he also had the courage to grab me hard by the arm and say, and I told you, you don't tell anybody my name.
[00:38:31.163 --> 00:38:32.063]  You can tell the story.
[00:38:32.083 --> 00:38:35.245]  And he said, I went and complained about it and was told to shut up.
[00:38:36.089 --> 00:38:41.153]  They know full well, here, bring your kid down to Zilker Park.
[00:38:41.674 --> 00:38:49.481]  We're gonna give them liquid monkey virus that is a death sentence.
[00:38:51.122 --> 00:38:52.964]  A death sentence.
[00:38:52.984 --> 00:38:54.565]  And there'll be no police investigation.
[00:38:54.825 --> 00:38:56.247]  There'll be no discussion on the news.
[00:38:56.447 --> 00:39:03.173]  Just like when I get up on air and say, all over the country, in the hydrofluorosilicic acid, they're adding radioactive isotopes.
[00:39:04.881 --> 00:39:12.147]  Local media goes out, checks it, at the wastewater plant, the treatment plant, and then the Geiger counter's off the chart, and they say, what is this?
[00:39:12.507 --> 00:39:15.409]  And the locals go, we don't know what it is.
[00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:16.991]  Forget about it.
[00:39:17.351 --> 00:39:19.012]  Must be in the aquifer.
[00:39:19.413 --> 00:39:22.795]  Must be naturally radioactive.
[00:39:23.276 --> 00:39:27.839]  And again, I just keep going back to this over and over again, instead of all the news, because they're killing us!
[00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:32.842]  It's back in the LA News that they forcibly are sterilizing people.
[00:39:33.102 --> 00:39:34.083]  Of course they are!
[00:39:34.103 --> 00:39:35.003]  Illegally!
[00:39:35.224 --> 00:39:36.764]  And no one's gonna get in trouble!
[00:39:37.004 --> 00:39:38.245]  Because it's a plan!
[00:39:41.827 --> 00:39:46.430]  You know how the SV40 and other cocktail of those specific viruses that, by the way, didn't come from monkeys?
[00:39:46.890 --> 00:39:48.651]  Dr. Salk and others bragged about it.
[00:39:49.791 --> 00:39:52.313]  Those were cooked up specially for you and your family.
[00:39:52.593 --> 00:39:54.194]  Sure, they grew them on monkey kidneys.
[00:39:54.734 --> 00:39:56.115]  But they didn't come from monkeys.
[00:39:56.335 --> 00:39:57.996]  That's a weaponized virus program.
[00:39:59.403 --> 00:40:00.183]  Guess what they do?
[00:40:00.243 --> 00:40:01.784]  They go plug into your DNA.
[00:40:01.824 --> 00:40:04.684]  They go into viral plaques, is what they're called.
[00:40:05.225 --> 00:40:09.986]  They engineered this whole family perfectly to wait until your hormone level lowers.
[00:40:10.886 --> 00:40:21.949]  And when your hormone level lowers, it then triggers the viral plaques, similar to shingles, which is really just in the whole family of herpes.
[00:40:23.735 --> 00:40:24.636]  When does it trigger?
[00:40:24.676 --> 00:40:25.677]  When you get older.
[00:40:26.197 --> 00:40:27.898]  When does it get to where it kills people?
[00:40:27.938 --> 00:40:28.779]  When you're old.
[00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:34.243]  When you're young, when you're under stress or have a lot of problems, that's when it breaks out.
[00:40:34.564 --> 00:40:37.286]  Folks, there's stuff a lot worse than herpes.
[00:40:37.626 --> 00:40:40.909]  It's called deadly... You know what SV40 can do in the sinus?
[00:40:42.110 --> 00:40:48.394]  The particular cancer, you can look it up, I forget its Latin name, but it looks like blue yogurt.
[00:40:49.355 --> 00:40:50.156]  Purple yogurt.
[00:40:52.332 --> 00:40:53.713]  How's that growing into your brain?
[00:40:53.913 --> 00:40:57.234]  Just a little, a little gift for you and your family.
[00:40:57.614 --> 00:41:00.735]  They're murdering you with pleasure.
[00:41:00.935 --> 00:41:17.561]  And if I walk up to Austin cops and start saying, hey, the government's murdering people, the DynCorp building right there in town, here's the Washington posters, the Chicago Tribune, how they got caught running child kidnapping rings, the cops, I've done this before, go, I know, I work for them, part-time.
[00:41:17.621 --> 00:41:18.582]  Get out of here, Alex.
[00:41:20.302 --> 00:41:21.242]  That happened in front of P.F.
[00:41:21.262 --> 00:41:21.602]  Chang's.
[00:41:22.302 --> 00:41:24.923]  And then another time the cops are like, yeah, we know, what do we do about it?
[00:41:25.683 --> 00:41:26.644]  What are we supposed to do about it?
[00:41:27.904 --> 00:41:29.324]  We're told who we can investigate.
[00:41:29.564 --> 00:41:32.305]  I mean, okay, I said I'd go to your phone calls and I'm going to go to them.
[00:41:32.925 --> 00:41:35.326]  But I talk about the culture of thugs.
[00:41:38.006 --> 00:41:41.667]  People that have figured this out decide to act like predators and thugs.
[00:41:43.028 --> 00:41:48.409]  So whether you're a street criminal, a corporate criminal, a corrupt cop, there's that whole culture.
[00:41:51.480 --> 00:42:04.081]  Or then you've got the culture of the slaves, who just get real self-serving though, and put their head down to everything, but then do the minimum amount of work, suck off things, don't care about anybody but themselves, and think that's an attribute.
[00:42:07.919 --> 00:42:26.192]  Then you've got the nanny-staters who go around persecuting people in the name of the government, whether they work for the government or not, who don't really care about the major studies that are out, like the environmentalists, who don't, the fake environmentalists, they don't care, they had a big Canadian study last year, they don't actually care about real issues, they just want the power from it that they are the moral authority.
[00:42:27.713 --> 00:42:36.099]  I think the Canadian study was a major government study, that the environmentalists were six times more likely to be thieves, and to be dishonest.
[00:42:37.793 --> 00:42:40.335]  The groups that answered that they were the biggest environmentalist.
[00:42:40.835 --> 00:42:45.358]  Because it's just a way to say, I'm a Pharisee, I'm good, all the rest of you are bad.
[00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:51.602]  Meanwhile, real conservationists, real environmentalists, people that are really concerned?
[00:42:51.622 --> 00:42:57.046]  Oh, Alex, they're not growing corn in Texas that has live HIV virus in it.
[00:43:01.629 --> 00:43:02.830]  And no one will even look that up.
[00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:03.911]  It's Associated Press.
[00:43:06.292 --> 00:43:06.793]  Protogen.
[00:43:07.952 --> 00:43:08.552]  Is the company.
[00:43:12.956 --> 00:43:19.641]  And that's why if a cop pulls me over because I'm driving late at night or something and I know I'm not speeding and they go, mind if I search and got any drugs?
[00:43:19.701 --> 00:43:20.841]  I'm like, do you have any drugs?
[00:43:21.642 --> 00:43:26.526]  Because you know the government ships most of them in and they're like, oh, oh, what's your problem?
[00:43:26.746 --> 00:43:27.807]  What's my problem?
[00:43:28.467 --> 00:43:37.550]  They're lining kids up nationwide and giving them oral cancer viruses, live cancer viruses that's communicable, and you're just going to laugh at me.
[00:43:37.570 --> 00:43:40.131]  Because, see, it's too big of an issue.
[00:43:40.411 --> 00:43:41.951]  It's too big for you to deal with.
[00:43:42.292 --> 00:43:52.295]  So you're just going to pick on me and act like you're holding society together and the thin blue line, blah, blah, blah, when we've got psycho-eugenicists running the whole show.
[00:43:54.195 --> 00:43:55.016]  But look at this article.
[00:43:56.095 --> 00:43:56.996]  from Forbes.
[00:43:57.076 --> 00:43:58.637]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[00:43:58.757 --> 00:44:01.038]  San Francisco 777 crash.
[00:44:01.538 --> 00:44:04.120]  Why did so many passengers evacuate with bags?
[00:44:05.721 --> 00:44:20.009]  And again, I've seen it in our local news that when the drag rats will catch, you know, two young yuppie women coming out of a restaurant down on South Congress or down on the old drag or whatever, they'll grab their, they'll order them to give them their purse, and the women usually out of fear will just give it to them.
[00:44:20.329 --> 00:44:22.771]  And if not, they'll punch them in the nose, rape them, whatever.
[00:44:24.824 --> 00:44:27.145]  And then I was thinking how that's just like the police.
[00:44:27.865 --> 00:44:29.346]  When they're like, I'm gonna search your car.
[00:44:29.366 --> 00:44:30.767]  It's not, mind if I search.
[00:44:30.987 --> 00:44:36.569]  It's like people on the New York subway will sit on both sides of you and go, mind if I look at your watch?
[00:44:36.609 --> 00:44:37.189]  Can I have it?
[00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:42.852]  So they're not legally actually robbing you.
[00:44:42.932 --> 00:44:45.253]  They're with the inference of it.
[00:44:45.873 --> 00:44:49.154]  And now the police are like, I'm gonna search the car.
[00:44:50.015 --> 00:44:52.296]  Give me authorization or I will taser you.
[00:44:55.908 --> 00:44:58.129]  Or answer my question or I will taser you!
[00:44:58.409 --> 00:45:03.411]  Failure to follow my order is a threat to the force continuum as an absolute error!
[00:45:03.451 --> 00:45:08.313]  You're all now private pile in the Marine Corps drill sergeant situation.
[00:45:09.733 --> 00:45:11.414]  I'm going to do a cavity search!
[00:45:13.215 --> 00:45:14.135]  The women are in the bikini.
[00:45:14.155 --> 00:45:15.715]  The video's up on Infowars.com right now.
[00:45:16.636 --> 00:45:17.396]  In Texas again.
[00:45:18.216 --> 00:45:19.177]  You're joking, right?
[00:45:19.677 --> 00:45:20.437]  I'm not joking!
[00:45:20.637 --> 00:45:21.398]  Up against the car!
[00:45:23.854 --> 00:45:26.455]  And then the police were like, well, they complied with it.
[00:45:26.975 --> 00:45:35.299]  Yeah, they complied like when somebody comes into a park and says, hey, a three-year-old, while your mom's in the bathroom at the park, get in the car, I said.
[00:45:36.179 --> 00:45:37.920]  The little kid reaches their hand up, does what they say.
[00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:39.200]  It's the authority figure.
[00:45:39.821 --> 00:45:42.202]  And that's what the drag rats do, robbing people.
[00:45:42.402 --> 00:45:45.903]  That's what the police do with their knock and talks, wanting to come in people's houses.
[00:45:45.963 --> 00:45:49.865]  It's all criminal psychology right out of Criminology 101.
[00:45:51.584 --> 00:45:53.425]  And that's all eugenics and all this is.
[00:45:53.645 --> 00:45:59.907]  It's just a bunch of predators who want to do mean things to people, setting the precedent that they can get away with bloody murder.
[00:46:00.107 --> 00:46:03.789]  And then they've got useful idiots down low who actually believe in the whole system.
[00:46:05.529 --> 00:46:16.514]  And so I'm not surprised that trendies flying into San Francisco on 777 out of South Korea, because this is how it is all over the world now.
[00:46:16.994 --> 00:46:19.035]  Anywhere that's industrialized, humans are the same.
[00:46:19.966 --> 00:46:47.408]  People are so into themselves, they won't risk their life to help somebody who's choking or whatever, or to go into a house to save people, but they will risk their lives if their iPad is in a burning house, or if their... I mean, imagine, the plane crashes, the tail falls off, it bursts into flame, jet fuel everywhere, and people are going in the overheads to get their bags out,
[00:46:49.537 --> 00:46:51.319]  To then try to get out of the aircraft.
[00:46:51.399 --> 00:46:54.162]  I mean, the minute it's crashing, there's flames.
[00:46:54.643 --> 00:47:06.256]  The first thing I'm doing, and with, you know, the strength that comes with caring about your kids, is grabbing my children, throwing them on my shoulder, and I'd probably get incredibly hurt just jumping out of the hole.
[00:47:08.258 --> 00:47:09.780]  That's just a normal behavior.
[00:47:12.947 --> 00:47:21.391]  But no, it's reported watching the videos and witnesses that it appears from the reports that people weren't even leaving their own kids but they wanted their bags.
[00:47:22.772 --> 00:47:39.260]  Now that's a programmed group of people that only care about themselves to such a point that one man even was interviewed by the New York Times said that he grabbed his bags and then his kids.
[00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:40.221]  They're even proud of it!
[00:47:43.473 --> 00:47:47.974]  I mean, I can't believe parents will let the CPS take their kids clearly when there's no reason to do it.
[00:47:48.214 --> 00:47:51.375]  And then when a family runs with their kids, they're called terrorists on the news.
[00:47:51.736 --> 00:47:55.937]  They've taken your basic, normal, human instinct and flushed it down the commode.
[00:48:08.208 --> 00:48:16.771]  This is the difference between having a civilization and not having a civilization is that good men do nothing and you have a tyranny.
[00:48:17.252 --> 00:48:20.833]  All that evil men and tyrants need to flourish is that good men and women do nothing.
[00:48:21.073 --> 00:48:25.115]  You know, I've started lifting weights again with light weights trying to lose weight.
[00:48:26.975 --> 00:48:35.479]  And so maybe once a week I have time to go down to a local YMCA and I'll watch cops come in wearing their local cop shirts
[00:48:37.102 --> 00:48:40.554]  And I'll watch him kind of strut around and bug their eyes out at people.
[00:48:40.574 --> 00:48:43.062]  They're not too bad, but I've seen groups shove them in there.
[00:48:45.646 --> 00:48:49.087]  It's a totally different group of people when the fire department is always there.
[00:48:49.127 --> 00:48:53.688]  No matter when I go, somebody from the Hays County Fire Department is always in there.
[00:48:53.968 --> 00:49:02.770]  I was watching these guys do like 60 pull-ups and then go back and do it again and doing these things we were doing, pull-ups and swinging their body all the way over, basically in a gymnast move.
[00:49:03.130 --> 00:49:09.651]  They're so nice and friendly because they're fire department people who actually have a real job and who actually serve the community.
[00:49:09.851 --> 00:49:12.592]  And I'll never forget watching the Austin Police with their cadets
[00:49:13.925 --> 00:49:17.030]  in a swim test and about a third of them could barely swim.
[00:49:17.471 --> 00:49:18.733]  Three of them had to be pulled out.
[00:49:18.753 --> 00:49:22.500]  I even shot video of this and life jackets put on because they couldn't swim.
[00:49:24.023 --> 00:49:26.807]  And the head police that were teaching them weren't that good of swimmers.
[00:49:28.459 --> 00:49:31.260]  I mean, you ought to be able to swim two miles to be a cop.
[00:49:31.761 --> 00:49:34.242]  You ought to be able to do 40 pull-ups to be a cop.
[00:49:34.702 --> 00:49:36.423]  And I'm not sitting here claiming I'm Mr. Tough Guy.
[00:49:36.723 --> 00:49:38.004]  I used to do 45 pull-ups.
[00:49:38.024 --> 00:49:39.124]  I can barely do three of them now.
[00:49:39.464 --> 00:49:44.407]  But the point is, as I watch these fire department guys, they are the polar opposite of the police now.
[00:49:44.767 --> 00:49:53.471]  Not saying all police are like this, but nice guys, friendly, not putting off a power trip, and just savagely lifting weights and just, you know, in incredible shape.
[00:49:53.951 --> 00:49:55.271]  You can tell they're drug-free, too.
[00:49:55.331 --> 00:49:56.252]  You can just look at their muscles.
[00:49:56.632 --> 00:49:59.873]  Just savagely strong, because they need to be able to pick people up and stuff.
[00:50:00.073 --> 00:50:02.334]  They need to be able to, you know, climb out of a window.
[00:50:02.915 --> 00:50:05.256]  And you just see the difference in the culture.
[00:50:05.436 --> 00:50:08.497]  And now they're trying to corrupt the fire departments and make them secret police.
[00:50:10.188 --> 00:50:12.009]  It's so disgusting to see that happen.
[00:50:12.250 --> 00:50:15.112]  And I've talked to a lot of retired people, read a lot of criminology.
[00:50:15.772 --> 00:50:20.496]  30, 40 years ago, all they cared about being a cop was that you were somewhat honest and really tough.
[00:50:21.277 --> 00:50:27.121]  Nowadays, it's about hiring little social worker bureaucrats who are on power trips and want to dominate you.
[00:50:27.281 --> 00:50:30.704]  Because a really tough guy is not going to want to dominate people that haven't done anything.
[00:50:31.744 --> 00:50:38.185]  A warrior is going to want to go after bad guys and defend innocent people, not, oh, I think you might have marijuana.
[00:50:38.305 --> 00:50:41.846]  I'm going to stick my hand in your rectum and then your vagina.
[00:50:42.606 --> 00:50:43.887]  I mean, that's totally illegal.
[00:50:44.887 --> 00:50:47.067]  But their supervisors have told them they're allowed to.
[00:50:47.407 --> 00:50:52.028]  It's a disgusting power trip by people that can't even swim.
[00:50:53.028 --> 00:50:56.689]  They're hiring people with under 100 IQs, and it's a joke.
[00:50:58.009 --> 00:51:00.470]  I do not want to be ruled over by a bunch of power tripping
[00:51:01.781 --> 00:51:07.312]  Semi-lobotomized morons that can't even do pull-ups.
[00:51:07.352 --> 00:51:07.953]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:09.602 --> 00:51:11.003]  Bill Carroll here for BluTax.
[00:51:11.223 --> 00:51:14.324]  Just because the IRS says you owe them a lot of money, are you just going to do what?

[00:51:16.405 --> 00:51:17.005]  What are you doing?
[00:51:17.025 --> 00:51:18.646]  You've got to fight this stuff.
[00:51:18.766 --> 00:51:19.486]  Here's what you need to do.

[00:51:42.837 --> 00:51:44.858]  Or how they helped set up installment agreements.

[00:52:09.753 --> 00:52:12.876]  Oklahoma reminds us there are many kinds of storms in our lives.
[00:52:13.236 --> 00:52:15.839]  Nature regularly sends us destructive storms.
[00:52:16.519 --> 00:52:18.842]  24 hours before a storm strikes, people panic.
[00:52:19.122 --> 00:52:22.365]  It would be wise to prepare ahead of the panic curve.
[00:52:22.565 --> 00:52:28.831]  The food price storm from drought and livestock problems is forecast to hit ridiculous heights by the end of the summer.
[00:52:29.111 --> 00:52:30.713]  Wonder if there will really be a problem?

[00:53:43.411 --> 00:53:43.671]  Why?

[00:53:46.453 --> 00:53:48.194]  We do not sell to government agencies.
[00:53:48.434 --> 00:53:52.577]  We manufacture our own bullets and load our own ammunition so it's in stock and ready to ship.
[00:53:52.737 --> 00:53:53.598]  Got empty cartridges?
[00:53:53.778 --> 00:53:58.041]  We can reload your brass, reducing your cost and eliminating the hidden federal excise tax.

[00:54:47.286 --> 00:54:48.667]  We have it on DVD and Blu-ray.
[00:54:49.107 --> 00:54:51.768]  InfoWarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:54:51.788 --> 00:54:51.848]  888-253-3139.
[00:54:51.868 --> 00:54:53.469]  And again, I remember growing up
[00:55:01.969 --> 00:55:07.035]  In Dallas and my dad had friends that were police would come over and stuff and play cards and things like that.
[00:55:07.315 --> 00:55:09.918]  They were all just really nice friendly Boy Scout type guys.
[00:55:10.639 --> 00:55:12.401]  And now more and more they want thugs.
[00:55:12.461 --> 00:55:14.162]  I'm not saying all departments are like this.
[00:55:14.463 --> 00:55:16.225]  If you've got a Boy Scout department that's good.
[00:55:16.865 --> 00:55:18.968]  But people think it's tough now to be a thug.
[00:55:19.588 --> 00:55:21.591]  I saw two different spy thrillers last week.
[00:55:22.691 --> 00:55:24.312]  One of them was called Numbers, I think.
[00:55:24.913 --> 00:55:27.135]  It's like where they're working at the CIA base in England.
[00:55:27.355 --> 00:55:29.977]  But the point is, and I was watching another one, Half Asleep.
[00:55:30.377 --> 00:55:31.218]  I don't remember the name of it.
[00:55:31.258 --> 00:55:32.819]  My wife was watching another one another night.
[00:55:32.839 --> 00:55:39.604]  And it's like the CIA goes in a house and kills, you know, the former CIA guy and goes ahead and just shoots their daughter while they're at it.
[00:55:39.785 --> 00:55:41.026]  And that's okay.
[00:55:41.506 --> 00:55:42.467]  That's a good thing to do.
[00:55:42.507 --> 00:55:43.508]  We got to kill their family.
[00:55:43.548 --> 00:55:44.468]  It's collateral damage.
[00:55:44.809 --> 00:55:48.752]  They're warping everybody's brains with these shows.
[00:55:50.515 --> 00:55:57.378]  And that's why the cops all the time, you see it in the news, go in a house, even the wrong house, and say, get in a fetal position to the naked guy out of his bed.
[00:55:57.678 --> 00:55:58.698]  Now crawl to us.
[00:55:58.718 --> 00:56:01.839]  And then they taser him and rubber bullet him for fun.
[00:56:02.620 --> 00:56:04.840]  And I've seen the videos of police laughing about it.
[00:56:05.341 --> 00:56:08.382]  Did you see how I shot that lady with the sign in the face with rubber bullets?
[00:56:09.582 --> 00:56:13.764]  Yes, she had blood pouring out her nose.
[00:56:14.104 --> 00:56:16.505]  You're going to have your bank accounts taken too, dum-dum.
[00:56:17.205 --> 00:56:19.807]  You're gonna be injected with cancer viruses, dumb-dumb.
[00:56:20.167 --> 00:56:23.409]  You're not being given this power to abuse people for no reason.
[00:56:23.849 --> 00:56:25.130]  Evil is coming in!
[00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:28.471]  And we need to wake up to it and say no.
[00:56:28.511 --> 00:56:30.352]  And I don't mean to obsess on the police all day.
[00:56:30.813 --> 00:56:33.014]  The point is, that's where the rubber meets the road.
[00:56:34.515 --> 00:56:36.796]  And I wish the police would try to be more like firefighters.
[00:56:37.757 --> 00:56:38.797]  And act like that.
[00:56:40.098 --> 00:56:45.021]  I mean, I guarantee you, folks, if I went and saw a group of firefighters being trained at the local pool,
[00:56:46.625 --> 00:56:48.727]  Deep Eddie, that I bet they could all swim.
[00:56:50.168 --> 00:56:59.955]  You don't know how bizarre it is to see the police and most of them were horrible swimmers and some of them had to be fished out and couldn't swim, couldn't tread water for five minutes.
[00:57:02.217 --> 00:57:03.838]  Like children gulping and drowning.
[00:57:03.898 --> 00:57:05.159]  I mean it's just mindless.
[00:57:05.199 --> 00:57:06.540]  I don't mean to go off into a jag.
[00:57:06.900 --> 00:57:08.402]  It's just so pathetic.
[00:57:09.471 --> 00:57:15.632]  Coming up after I take some phone calls, analyst, George Zimmerman probably won't be convicted of murder of manslaughter.
[00:57:15.672 --> 00:57:16.212]  Here's why.
[00:57:16.452 --> 00:57:17.893]  And I agree, they have a very bad case.
[00:57:19.033 --> 00:57:22.294]  And there's reasonable doubt that he's guilty.
[00:57:22.314 --> 00:57:24.694]  I think he was stupid to go following somebody around with a gun.
[00:57:26.075 --> 00:57:28.395]  Unless he saw him committing a crime, and that's a different subject.
[00:57:30.716 --> 00:57:36.917]  George Zimmerman is probably an out-of-control cop wannabe type.
[00:57:37.779 --> 00:57:39.581]  Turns out most of his family and friends are cops.
[00:57:39.601 --> 00:57:42.244]  I don't know why he didn't try to go get on their department.
[00:57:42.684 --> 00:57:52.394]  But the point is, is that he was clearly jumped on top of and beat up, and now threats to riot, loot, if Zimmerman found innocent, intensify.
[00:57:52.495 --> 00:57:59.041]  It is thousands of tweets without even looking that people, where they're going to attack, what they're going to burn down.
[00:58:00.670 --> 00:58:03.011]  All racially organized, basically.
[00:58:03.632 --> 00:58:05.153]  And it is really, really sad.
[00:58:05.913 --> 00:58:11.556]  You know, why don't we all get together and get angry and march against cancer viruses and vaccines?
[00:58:12.117 --> 00:58:12.897]  Oh no, no, no.
[00:58:12.977 --> 00:58:14.218]  Jesse Jackson doesn't support that.
[00:58:14.538 --> 00:58:17.820]  Why don't we all march by the millions for the unborn children getting chopped up?
[00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:19.601]  Where we know they're innocent and it's wrong.
[00:58:20.161 --> 00:58:23.723]  Oh no, it's too much fun to... Notice how the Justice Department kept calling Zimmerman white?
[00:58:24.243 --> 00:58:26.124]  The guy looks like Kim Jong-un to me.
[00:58:26.685 --> 00:58:28.946]  Nothing against Asians or anything, but I mean, you know.
[00:58:32.278 --> 00:58:33.919]  I mean, what is this whole deal?
[00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:37.982]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to be right back, take a few phone calls.
[00:58:38.462 --> 00:58:41.724]  Liberal Bill is the first caller coming up.
[00:58:42.385 --> 00:58:45.227]  Then we'll talk to Kent, Jason, Ryan, John, and many others.
[00:58:45.287 --> 00:58:47.368]  Then, Larry Pratt on the U.N.

[00:58:52.111 --> 00:58:56.074]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:59.705 --> 00:59:02.826]  Oklahoma reminds us there are many kinds of storms in our lives.
[00:59:03.186 --> 00:59:06.268]  Nature regularly sends us destructive storms.
[00:59:06.468 --> 00:59:08.789]  24 hours before a storm strikes, people panic.
[00:59:09.069 --> 00:59:12.290]  It would be wise to prepare ahead of the panic curve.
[00:59:12.530 --> 00:59:18.753]  The food price storm, from drought and livestock problems, is forecast to hit ridiculous heights by the end of the summer.
[00:59:19.053 --> 00:59:20.694]  Wonder if there'll really be a problem?

[01:00:02.392 --> 01:00:04.297]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:04.778 --> 01:00:07.545]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:14.144 --> 01:00:18.346]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:18.987 --> 01:00:19.787]  You want answers?
[01:00:20.568 --> 01:00:21.468]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:22.108 --> 01:00:25.730]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:26.311 --> 01:00:30.393]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:41.342]  Larry Pratt's coming up on the U.N.
[01:00:41.382 --> 01:00:44.845]  gun treaty, a new Fast and Furious scandal that's getting basically no attention.
[01:00:45.865 --> 01:00:47.807]  It is all coming up, but thanks for holding.
[01:00:48.187 --> 01:00:52.431]  Liberal Bill says he disagrees, so he goes to the head of the line.
[01:00:53.052 --> 01:00:54.533]  And how you doing, Liberal Bill?
[01:00:55.734 --> 01:01:02.860]  Well, Alex, first of all, I gotta say, I just, just come on, Alex.
[01:01:03.020 --> 01:01:03.981]  I mean, really?
[01:01:06.066 --> 01:01:08.488]  Come on, I can do a better imitation of a fake NPR person.
[01:01:08.928 --> 01:01:13.232]  What you're spewing is conspiratorial hatred.
[01:01:13.792 --> 01:01:15.093]  It's racist!
[01:01:15.173 --> 01:01:16.274]  Racist!
[01:01:16.694 --> 01:01:17.655]  Racists go home!
[01:01:18.035 --> 01:01:19.036]  Racists go home!
[01:01:19.536 --> 01:01:20.817]  You know, I'd like to have liberty and freedom.
[01:01:21.037 --> 01:01:22.018]  Shut up racists!
[01:01:22.278 --> 01:01:23.139]  Shut up racists!
[01:01:23.159 --> 01:01:26.601]  You're not very convincing as a real authoritarian calling himself a liberal.
[01:01:27.782 --> 01:01:31.865]  But Alex, honestly, what is wrong with a little bit of
[01:01:32.469 --> 01:01:34.030]  Of the men in black, you know?
[01:01:34.090 --> 01:01:37.572]  I mean, we like our cops to be scaring us, don't we?
[01:01:37.592 --> 01:01:43.296]  I don't get scared when I see black ski masks and black helicopters and checkpoints.
[01:01:43.516 --> 01:01:45.097]  That's our darling government.
[01:01:45.377 --> 01:01:48.359]  I like a proctology exam by the SWAT team commander.
[01:01:48.379 --> 01:01:49.120]  USA!
[01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:50.561]  USA!
[01:01:50.821 --> 01:01:53.302]  What I don't like is other citizens with guns.
[01:01:53.582 --> 01:01:54.543]  That's scary!
[01:01:54.563 --> 01:01:58.966]  Welcome like a true racist, Alex.
[01:01:59.605 --> 01:02:01.466]  I am alright.
[01:02:01.686 --> 01:02:03.368]  Like a true racist.
[01:02:03.848 --> 01:02:04.748]  Well, no, a fascist.
[01:02:04.828 --> 01:02:06.169]  You are a fascist.
[01:02:06.630 --> 01:02:07.750]  A racist.
[01:02:08.071 --> 01:02:10.232]  Hey, you know, the insurance companies wrote the health care bill.
[01:02:10.252 --> 01:02:10.872]  It's a giant scam.
[01:02:10.912 --> 01:02:11.333]  Rip us off.
[01:02:11.613 --> 01:02:12.734]  Shut up, racist.
[01:02:12.994 --> 01:02:14.154]  Shut up, racist.
[01:02:14.415 --> 01:02:15.355]  Shut up, racist.
[01:02:15.375 --> 01:02:16.196]  Have you learned how this works?
[01:02:16.816 --> 01:02:17.777]  I'm intellectual.
[01:02:18.237 --> 01:02:19.878]  Libertarians are stupid.
[01:02:20.599 --> 01:02:22.180]  We're the smartest people in the world.
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:23.380]  Rachel Maddow.
[01:02:24.321 --> 01:02:25.122]  I'm sorry.
[01:02:27.987 --> 01:02:29.648]  You stole my thunder, Alex.
[01:02:29.768 --> 01:02:35.050]  Obamacare is good for everybody, and you are a racist for not wanting it.
[01:02:35.531 --> 01:02:36.091]  Okay?
[01:02:36.171 --> 01:02:38.432]  That's my final point, Alex.
[01:02:38.552 --> 01:02:39.713]  Eugenics is a good thing.
[01:02:39.753 --> 01:02:41.073]  No, but tell me how smart you are.
[01:02:41.093 --> 01:02:45.536]  Because if you're a liberal authoritarian, you've got to just constantly talk about, I'm so smart!
[01:02:45.776 --> 01:02:46.956]  I'm so smart!
[01:02:47.216 --> 01:02:48.117]  I'm so smart!
[01:02:48.337 --> 01:02:48.997]  I want you to do that.
[01:02:49.498 --> 01:02:50.818]  Say, I'm so smart five times.
[01:02:51.819 --> 01:02:54.540]  Well, clearly, I'm so smart.
[01:02:54.580 --> 01:02:56.121]  I went to Berkeley, you know?
[01:02:58.325 --> 01:03:02.727]  I got my doctorate from Berkeley, Southern California, you know?
[01:03:02.867 --> 01:03:04.428]  So smart!
[01:03:04.448 --> 01:03:07.329]  I bet that's actually gonna tell me fluoride's bad.
[01:03:07.550 --> 01:03:09.490]  Yeah, here's 24 Harvard Studies.
[01:03:09.510 --> 01:03:10.871]  Uh-huh!
[01:03:11.131 --> 01:03:12.012]  Racist!
[01:03:12.372 --> 01:03:13.292]  Racist!
[01:03:13.592 --> 01:03:14.533]  Racist!
[01:03:14.893 --> 01:03:15.853]  I appreciate your call.
[01:03:16.134 --> 01:03:17.334]  That's too much fun, actually.
[01:03:17.574 --> 01:03:18.975]  I'll do a whole three-hour show like that.
[01:03:19.355 --> 01:03:20.355]  Sniveling someday.
[01:03:20.596 --> 01:03:22.076]  Let's talk to Kenton, Mississippi.
[01:03:22.216 --> 01:03:22.897]  You're on the air.
[01:03:22.957 --> 01:03:23.357]  Go ahead.
[01:03:24.864 --> 01:03:26.405]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:03:26.786 --> 01:03:30.769]  Shut up racist!
[01:03:31.809 --> 01:03:32.470]  That's better.
[01:03:32.510 --> 01:03:34.331]  You conservatives learn to do what I tell you.
[01:03:34.351 --> 01:03:35.672]  Go ahead.
[01:03:36.253 --> 01:03:37.354]  Your name's Kent.
[01:03:37.614 --> 01:03:39.715]  Being a man fundamentally is racist.
[01:03:41.136 --> 01:03:46.821]  I didn't mean to change my point, but I was watching you on PrisonPlanet.tv and you got me sidetracked.
[01:03:47.321 --> 01:03:49.222]  You got me kind of aggravated.
[01:03:49.283 --> 01:03:52.005]  Not you, but bringing up the fluoride and all that.
[01:03:52.859 --> 01:04:03.415]  I go every day to work preaching and showing people that you can pull up all these articles, the fluoride, then the water, you know, the matrix that you're putting in, and they laugh.
[01:04:03.715 --> 01:04:06.399]  That's because I know you're a racist!
[01:04:08.078 --> 01:04:11.299]  I work with a police officer that doesn't even know half the law.
[01:04:11.820 --> 01:04:14.341]  And he thinks that we've got to be, you know, surveilled.
[01:04:14.401 --> 01:04:15.281]  Like, we're the criminals.
[01:04:15.401 --> 01:04:16.362]  Listen, I agree.
[01:04:16.422 --> 01:04:17.782]  The NSA was just granted new powers.
[01:04:18.122 --> 01:04:29.347]  I believe everyone should have to wear a microphone down their throat and up their rear end so you can have a colon cam so the police don't even have to pull you over now and proctology your family.
[01:04:29.567 --> 01:04:31.248]  They can just flip on the live cam.
[01:04:31.448 --> 01:04:35.350]  They have the new pills you take to tell your doctor when you took them wirelessly.
[01:04:35.690 --> 01:04:36.190]  I agree.
[01:04:36.571 --> 01:04:37.371]  We all need to have
[01:04:37.672 --> 01:04:40.785]  From birth, cameras mounted inside our bodies.
[01:04:41.529 --> 01:04:42.774]  Actually, I shouldn't give them ideas, but...
[01:04:44.540 --> 01:04:46.762]  And if you're not for it, you're a racist!
[01:04:47.342 --> 01:04:48.784]  Anything else for Mississippi?
[01:04:49.124 --> 01:04:49.965]  He hung up.
[01:04:50.765 --> 01:04:53.027]  Obviously, for Mississippi, he must be stupid.
[01:04:53.948 --> 01:04:56.470]  Only people from Berkeley are smart.
[01:04:56.490 --> 01:04:58.472]  Or the village in Manhattan.
[01:04:58.492 --> 01:05:00.753]  Or a few other places as well.
[01:05:01.354 --> 01:05:02.555]  What a splendid idea.
[01:05:02.575 --> 01:05:04.176]  The colon cam.
[01:05:04.657 --> 01:05:06.318]  That will be the new American flag.
[01:05:06.638 --> 01:05:08.440]  But make sure Bin Laden isn't hiding in there.
[01:05:09.665 --> 01:05:13.286]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us?
[01:05:13.526 --> 01:05:18.807]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[01:05:19.027 --> 01:05:26.588]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[01:05:26.768 --> 01:05:35.890]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[01:05:36.090 --> 01:05:43.078]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[01:05:43.238 --> 01:05:46.122]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[01:05:46.142 --> 01:05:53.070]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse, but demand a war.
[01:05:53.630 --> 01:05:54.651]  Oh, there's another one!
[01:05:54.671 --> 01:05:55.913]  Another plane just hit!
[01:05:55.933 --> 01:05:56.773]  State of Mind.
[01:05:57.014 --> 01:05:58.415]  Because there's a war on.
[01:05:58.676 --> 01:05:59.336]  Or your mind.
[01:05:59.617 --> 01:06:03.641]  Get your copy of State of Mind the movie at InfoWars.com.

[01:08:20.722 --> 01:08:21.702]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:22.243 --> 01:08:25.865]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:26.445 --> 01:08:30.508]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:36.151 --> 01:08:37.813]  Alright, we're now into hour number two.
[01:08:37.873 --> 01:08:39.154]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:08:39.554 --> 01:08:44.678]  The news websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:08:44.698 --> 01:08:48.601]  We're streaming video and have all the films posted at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:08:48.981 --> 01:08:58.869]  We're joined until the bottom of the hour by Larry Pratt, the head of Gun Owners of America, the No Compromise Second Amendment Group, as Ron Paul has said, that is really
[01:09:00.100 --> 01:09:10.275]  Forced the NRA, and I've even had one of their big board members on, Ted Nugent, to agree to become more hardcore to where I can actually say some good things about the NRA today.
[01:09:11.144 --> 01:09:14.486]  Thank God for Gun Owners of America and Larry Pratt.
[01:09:15.426 --> 01:09:22.511]  That's the group we need to have six, seven million members like the NRA, not its however many members it is.
[01:09:22.531 --> 01:09:25.592]  I know it's the second biggest gun group in the country, so thank God for them.
[01:09:25.812 --> 01:09:28.714]  We're going to get a big update on a host of issues with him in just a moment.
[01:09:29.094 --> 01:09:31.496]  Then at the bottom of the hour, I promise to go to Jason
[01:09:32.236 --> 01:09:36.600]  And Ryan, and John, and George, and Bill, and everybody else that's holding, we'll go to your calls.
[01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:38.321]  Then I'm going to get into the Egypt.
[01:09:38.662 --> 01:09:39.542]  I haven't gotten to that yet.
[01:09:39.562 --> 01:09:51.753]  The latest on that, the latest on the IRS scandal, the latest on quantitative easing and what's happening in the bond market, and just a bunch of other news that we're going to be discussing here today.
[01:09:51.813 --> 01:09:55.496]  But I wanted to play this for Larry Pratt and everybody else out there watching or listening.
[01:09:56.197 --> 01:09:57.838]  Radio listeners can go to InfoWars.com.
[01:09:58.959 --> 01:10:04.462]  And the title of the video is, New Gun Show Exposes Joe Biden as a Fraud.
[01:10:04.482 --> 01:10:09.224]  And I'm going to tweak that out on Real Alex Jones while Larry Pratt is talking here in a moment.
[01:10:09.484 --> 01:10:12.366]  If you want to find the link that way, follow us there at Twitter.
[01:10:12.386 --> 01:10:15.847]  This is just a few minutes from the 15-minute shooting show we did.
[01:10:15.867 --> 01:10:22.931]  And what we do is we do shooting shows, we do entertainment reviews, you name it, to get mainstream people into the liberty movement.
[01:10:24.012 --> 01:10:27.114]  The YouTube stuff is kind of our outreach.
[01:10:27.634 --> 01:10:29.816]  PrisonPlanet.tv is for our hardcore supporters.
[01:10:30.496 --> 01:10:38.921]  And here's just a short clip I wanted to get Larry's take on first, because this video went viral a few months ago, so we incorporated it in, where Biden says, don't get a shotgun.
[01:10:42.008 --> 01:10:42.948]  I just had a Freudian slip.
[01:10:56.577 --> 01:10:59.880]  And women, children, men, you name it, it's a great firearm.
[01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:01.721]  Well Biden says don't get that.
[01:11:01.762 --> 01:11:06.566]  He says get a shotgun, go out and commit a felony, just fire it off your front porch at somebody.
[01:11:06.906 --> 01:11:15.253]  So let's go to that clip showing a nine-year-old, first time he'd shot an AR-15 at about a hundred yards, hitting bullseye every time.
[01:11:15.293 --> 01:11:15.713]  Here it is.
[01:11:16.154 --> 01:11:22.018]  Nephew, my brother's son, Rocker, and he's been dying to do some shooting and
[01:11:23.956 --> 01:11:31.485]  We thought it'd be like a little much for him to climb behind the 50 cal, but we had a 223 and we let him loose on that.
[01:11:32.746 --> 01:11:34.589]  He had a pretty good shot.
[01:11:40.933 --> 01:11:44.295]  Vice President Biden told women not to get a .223 rifle.
[01:11:44.955 --> 01:11:46.196]  That it was too much for them to handle.
[01:11:46.756 --> 01:11:48.818]  He said instead to get a 12-gauge shotgun.
[01:11:49.338 --> 01:11:52.120]  If you want to protect yourself, get a double-barrel shotgun.
[01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:55.462]  As you can see here, it's not the best gun for beginners.
[01:11:55.622 --> 01:11:59.684]  Put that double-barrel shotgun and fire two blasts.
[01:12:01.385 --> 01:12:03.967]  Here you see how .223 is perfect for children and women.
[01:12:04.367 --> 01:12:05.628]  You don't need an AR-15.
[01:12:05.828 --> 01:12:07.028]  It's harder to aim.
[01:12:12.608 --> 01:12:13.719]  It's harder to use.
[01:12:16.135 --> 01:12:18.836]  A nine-year-old rocker was hitting bull's-eyes from the start with the .223 AR-15.
[01:12:18.856 --> 01:12:24.898]  One of the things that I was shocked about... Ah, that's good.
[01:12:25.719 --> 01:12:29.280]  That full 15-minute video premiered over the weekend on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:33.462]  It's now up on InfoWars.com for the full radio audience, if you want to go see it.
[01:12:33.482 --> 01:12:43.486]  But it shows women where people, as a joke, give them a 12-gauge the first time they shoot it, and they don't know to pull it into their shoulder, so they leave some space and it knocks them over.
[01:12:44.386 --> 01:12:47.449]  Imagine telling beginners, go buy a 12-gauge, go fire it out your front door.
[01:12:47.509 --> 01:12:49.070]  That's what you do when there's a problem.
[01:12:49.110 --> 01:12:50.712]  The exact opposite of what you do.
[01:12:51.092 --> 01:12:52.953]  The exact type of gun a beginner wants.
[01:12:54.375 --> 01:12:58.498]  I would get something like a, you know, .223 single shot or something for a beginner, or a .22.
[01:12:58.778 --> 01:13:00.480]  Then after that, graduate on.
[01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:01.841]  But I'm gonna shut up and go to Larry Pratt.
[01:13:02.121 --> 01:13:06.385]  Larry, you know, you've seen that viral video, so we've put it out in context with a child.
[01:13:06.685 --> 01:13:10.689]  I think it's important to get this video and continue to show what a fraud Joe Biden is.
[01:13:12.759 --> 01:13:14.060]  Larry, what's your take on that?
[01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:15.001]  Yes, sir.
[01:13:15.221 --> 01:13:15.781]  I can hear you.
[01:13:15.841 --> 01:13:16.402]  You hearing me?
[01:13:16.442 --> 01:13:16.822]  Yes, sir.
[01:13:16.862 --> 01:13:17.242]  You hear me?
[01:13:17.483 --> 01:13:17.803]  Oh, good.
[01:13:17.883 --> 01:13:18.183]  Okay.
[01:13:18.443 --> 01:13:18.904]  We're cooking.
[01:13:19.264 --> 01:13:29.752]  Yeah, that is just a fabulous video, and it shows just how impervious to new information a liberal ideologue is.
[01:13:30.612 --> 01:13:42.321]  I've talked to people who tried to explain to the Vice President, sir, it's not exactly the way you were saying that actually, you know, just like your video showed,
[01:13:42.822 --> 01:13:48.744]  If you want to get yourself flat on your back, just pick up a shotgun and use it without any instruction whatsoever.
[01:13:49.424 --> 01:13:59.766]  And meanwhile, in the one that I saw, a lady with her hearing muffs on is very controlled, firing at a target.
[01:13:59.866 --> 01:14:00.146]  Boom.
[01:14:00.647 --> 01:14:00.907]  Boom.
[01:14:01.447 --> 01:14:01.707]  Boom.
[01:14:02.187 --> 01:14:02.447]  Boom.
[01:14:02.707 --> 01:14:04.127]  No problem whatsoever.
[01:14:05.448 --> 01:14:06.348]  But the Vice President
[01:14:06.783 --> 01:14:10.005]  He knows everything, so how could we tell him anything?
[01:14:10.646 --> 01:14:20.492]  The guy, I thought, kind of showed us the liberal mind in all that it is in this particular episode, where it is so demonstrable.
[01:14:20.812 --> 01:14:25.515]  We're not talking about whether Keynesian economics in 20 years is going to ruin the country.
[01:14:26.116 --> 01:14:28.417]  We're talking about what's going to happen in the next 20 seconds!
[01:14:30.302 --> 01:14:47.136]  Exactly, and you know, I've grown up obviously born in Texas, been around a lot of what I would just call good old-fashioned populist type people, Larry, but libertarians, conservatives, they may be wrong on some issues sometimes, but they'll come over and help you fix your truck or fix your tractor.
[01:14:47.356 --> 01:14:49.257]  They'll come over, they know how to fix the air conditioner.
[01:14:49.478 --> 01:14:57.544]  They'll come over and help you carry your groceries in, and they want help too, and they'll help somebody that's choking, and they'll help somebody on the side of the road, and they'll stand up.
[01:14:57.924 --> 01:14:59.446]  So-called liberals, I've noticed,
[01:14:59.986 --> 01:15:05.449]  We'll just sit there and say, call 9-1-1, call 9-1-1 if somebody's being assaulted or somebody's choking.
[01:15:05.810 --> 01:15:06.510]  I've seen it.
[01:15:06.750 --> 01:15:08.131]  They're not really liberals.
[01:15:08.471 --> 01:15:10.112]  They are domesticated idiots.
[01:15:10.472 --> 01:15:29.384]  Consistent with what you're saying, studies of giving patterns of people in different states show that the more conservative of the states are the places where more is given to private charity, where people obviously assume that they're responsible for helping their fellow citizen, and
[01:15:30.144 --> 01:15:37.068]  They're not leaving it all to the government, whereas, as you say, the 9-11 mentality is, just leave it all to the government.
[01:15:38.089 --> 01:15:48.574]  A friend of Gun Owners of America has been a town hall columnist, and my mind has just dropped his name right off the tray.
[01:15:48.594 --> 01:15:49.575]  It's okay, tell the story.
[01:15:49.855 --> 01:15:55.598]  He's a professor down in the University of North Carolina, and he started out as a 100% down the line liberal.
[01:15:57.805 --> 01:16:04.050]  And then a couple that he knew was murdered, I think, in their car alongside a roadway.
[01:16:04.570 --> 01:16:09.794]  And he would go by that point every day and couldn't help but remember that that's where they died.
[01:16:09.814 --> 01:16:11.395]  And, of course, they didn't have a gun.
[01:16:11.415 --> 01:16:12.276]  And he knew that.
[01:16:12.836 --> 01:16:15.198]  Well, he finally got a gun.
[01:16:15.578 --> 01:16:18.320]  And for kind of the right reason, you know, protect himself.
[01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:24.705]  And once he did that, he was on his way to becoming a conservative.
[01:16:24.925 --> 01:16:26.746]  And when I talked to him one time about
[01:16:27.416 --> 01:16:46.514]  Uh, his book that he had written, he said, you know, you're right, I hadn't thought of it that way, but once I took responsibility for my own protection, the most important thing that is in my life, my life itself, then I began to question why all these other government programs?
[01:16:46.934 --> 01:16:49.917]  If I can take care of myself, and if I should take care of myself,
[01:16:50.492 --> 01:16:55.333]  Then what's with all this government welfare stuff and all the control that comes with it?
[01:16:55.513 --> 01:16:57.414]  And Biden knows what he's doing consciously.
[01:16:57.994 --> 01:17:04.375]  We may be winning the culture war for liberty in many respects and Obamacare is in trouble and their open border plan is in trouble.
[01:17:04.575 --> 01:17:06.536]  Some really good news we can now announce to people.
[01:17:06.976 --> 01:17:10.877]  But the problem is they're winning the slow war of domestication.
[01:17:11.097 --> 01:17:16.058]  101 million Americans, according to the Department of Labor and statistics, are now
[01:17:16.658 --> 01:17:18.319]  Getting food aid from the government.
[01:17:18.599 --> 01:17:21.380]  More people than are in the private workforce.
[01:17:21.780 --> 01:17:22.200]  That's right.
[01:17:22.420 --> 01:17:26.021]  Mike Adams, by the way, is the professor I was trying to come up with a name for.
[01:17:26.502 --> 01:17:40.707]  And one of the things that we want to do here at Gun Owners of America more consistently, we have access to some rural acreage not far from the Gun Owners of America office, and we're going to start taking staffers out.
[01:17:40.767 --> 01:17:41.567]  We found that even
[01:17:42.788 --> 01:17:49.352]  Sometimes, conservative Christian men and women are all confused about the Second Amendment.
[01:17:49.692 --> 01:17:51.553]  That's why I like the Appleseed Project.
[01:17:51.573 --> 01:17:55.855]  Just like the globalists try to recruit into collectivism, we have to recruit into liberty.
[01:17:57.023 --> 01:18:07.291]  I think that's the ticket, and what they're doing in that apple seed project is terrific, and I guess you might say we're going to be the Capitol Hill apple seed project.
[01:18:08.392 --> 01:18:11.054]  And I think it's going to pay some dividends, because we've seen it.
[01:18:12.095 --> 01:18:23.083]  Professor Adams was a very conspicuous case of when somebody finally learns that guns, there's a right end and a wrong end of a gun, and when you know how to handle the right end of the gun,
[01:18:23.752 --> 01:18:25.073]  It's not such a big deal.
[01:18:26.453 --> 01:18:27.774]  Obviously, you use common sense.
[01:18:28.154 --> 01:18:29.835]  You demystify it.
[01:18:29.875 --> 01:18:34.157]  Now, expanding here on the time we've got with you, shifting gears, what's going on with the U.N.
[01:18:34.577 --> 01:18:35.097]  gun treaty?
[01:18:35.137 --> 01:18:41.280]  Obama's saying he's going to sign it, even if the Senate doesn't ratify it, and even mainstream media goes, can he do that?
[01:18:41.340 --> 01:18:42.221]  Is that dictatorial?
[01:18:42.521 --> 01:18:45.422]  Well, that's like asking, you know, does a fish swim in the ocean?
[01:18:45.442 --> 01:18:46.423]  Of course it's dictatorial.
[01:18:46.843 --> 01:18:47.883]  Well, he can sign it.
[01:18:47.943 --> 01:18:51.385]  That's what would have to be done before he can refer it to the Senate.
[01:18:51.889 --> 01:18:57.953]  But that's where even Democrat Senators are going to look at that puppy and say, that doesn't hunt here.
[01:18:58.834 --> 01:19:00.375]  The U.N.
[01:19:00.435 --> 01:19:01.215]  is not popular.
[01:19:01.576 --> 01:19:02.937]  Gun control is not popular.
[01:19:03.257 --> 01:19:05.238]  That's unpopularity squared.
[01:19:05.739 --> 01:19:09.321]  No, I know, but he's had his chief brainwasher in his own words.
[01:19:09.701 --> 01:19:15.185]  The Attorney General has said that we're going to try to do this even if they don't ratify it, is my point.
[01:19:15.785 --> 01:19:19.408]  That's where I think we need to be very alert.
[01:19:19.870 --> 01:19:30.157]  What we've seen happen, even under the Clinton administration, was a New Age gold mine in Wyoming, outside of the National Park there.
[01:19:31.038 --> 01:19:49.630]  And when they applied to start mining activity, they went through something like $3 million worth of permits and inspections, and they were just about on the verge of mining again, like three miles from old Yellowstone Park.
[01:19:50.348 --> 01:19:53.051]  And the Clinton bureaucrats went running up to the U.N.
[01:19:53.752 --> 01:19:54.653]  and had the U.N.
[01:19:54.693 --> 01:19:57.816]  declare the park... World Heritage.
[01:19:58.256 --> 01:20:02.921]  Yeah, World Heritage Park, and no mining within a hundred miles.
[01:20:03.241 --> 01:20:14.052]  Took care of that mine, and I can see something similar being done with either this administration or, God forbid, a future Obama-type administration.
[01:20:15.418 --> 01:20:24.606]  Somehow, legislating through the UN, saying, we've got to comply with the world law, because we are good world citizens.
[01:20:25.006 --> 01:20:37.837]  Well, that's the real danger, and I think if the President does sign it, if we ever do get an American as President again, we ought to have him unsign it and send it back where it came from.
[01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:40.101]  Sure, well it's like the carbon taxes.
[01:20:40.201 --> 01:20:52.725]  Congress voted that down almost four years ago and Obama just used a regulation on microwaves to add a line in there about increasing the cost of carbon and now he says he's going to do other executive actions.
[01:20:52.745 --> 01:20:53.685]  He can't do that.
[01:20:54.565 --> 01:20:58.847]  He can't implement parts of Obamacare executively.
[01:20:58.907 --> 01:21:00.008]  It's unconstitutional.
[01:21:00.348 --> 01:21:06.171]  What's going on with Congress when this guy is such a lame duck, has no political power?
[01:21:07.831 --> 01:21:11.233]  The last vestiges of capital he had politically are draining out of him.
[01:21:11.253 --> 01:21:13.954]  I mean, isn't it time to really go after him politically?
[01:21:14.255 --> 01:21:17.116]  Or will Congress just sit there and let him run over him?
[01:21:17.676 --> 01:21:19.777]  So far, the latter seems to be the case.
[01:21:20.217 --> 01:21:21.578]  John Boehner, the Speaker,
[01:21:22.495 --> 01:21:35.266]  Has it well within his ability and power to tell the President, we're just not going to send you any money for enforcing unconstitutional gun control, for implementing a U.N.
[01:21:35.426 --> 01:21:37.528]  treaty, or even signing a U.N.
[01:21:37.788 --> 01:21:38.168]  treaty.
[01:21:38.929 --> 01:21:40.030]  We're not going to do any of that.
[01:21:40.630 --> 01:21:44.714]  And yet, they just sit around and say, well, what can we do?
[01:21:44.754 --> 01:21:50.839]  We can't... See, they will tell us if we tell them, we want you to stop Obamacare, we want you to cut the funding
[01:21:51.109 --> 01:21:51.889]  And just kill it.
[01:21:52.189 --> 01:21:53.189]  D-O-A.
[01:21:53.850 --> 01:21:58.330]  And they will say, well, but then the president would allow the government to be shut down.
[01:21:58.851 --> 01:22:03.852]  Well, because there wouldn't be a budget, or there wouldn't even be a continuing resolution.
[01:22:04.432 --> 01:22:20.435]  Well, you know, if nothing happens to increase spending, to pay for the current excessive spending, the taxes that come in on a monthly basis would run 57% of the federal government, which is still way too much.
[01:22:20.876 --> 01:22:29.744]  It would pay for all the Social Security and Medicare payments, so all of those that are depending on those federal funds would still be getting those federal funds.
[01:22:30.164 --> 01:22:36.109]  But what it might mean is that some of the bureaucrats inside the Beltway would be furloughed without pay.
[01:22:36.129 --> 01:22:37.550]  Well, that's the larger problem.
[01:22:37.711 --> 01:22:41.974]  And they're there lobbying to keep this going, but we're already bankrupt.
[01:22:42.234 --> 01:22:44.777]  We can't let them continue to bankrupt us.
[01:22:44.837 --> 01:22:48.179]  They hope through that emergency to then collectivize the country.
[01:22:49.140 --> 01:22:54.005]  And I think a lot of the so-called libertarians that are in Congress are scared of the dinosaur media.
[01:22:54.225 --> 01:22:59.650]  But you notice that Joe Biden and Obama, when speaking to contributors, these tapes have come out in the last month.
[01:22:59.670 --> 01:23:04.414]  I want to get your take on that before getting back into guns specifically and where the future attack on that front's going.
[01:23:04.714 --> 01:23:08.437]  With the head of Gunners of America, Larry Pratt, joining us on this Monday edition.
[01:23:09.498 --> 01:23:15.646]  Is that they attack Ted Cruz and Rand Paul and say these guys are dangerous, we've got to shoot them down politically.
[01:23:16.027 --> 01:23:24.698]  They're extremists because they know if real libertarian constitutional conservatism, Americana, ever takes root, which it's starting to do,
[01:23:25.399 --> 01:23:30.522]  You even see Karl Rove attacking real conservatives and libertarians with the RINOs.
[01:23:30.802 --> 01:23:38.046]  They're desperate in 2014 that if the Campaign for Liberty types get a stronger foothold, we could reverse all this.
[01:23:38.266 --> 01:23:48.171]  That's why the whole left, the collectivist, the establishment Republicans are pulling out all the stops because what Rand Paul and Ted Cruz are doing will defeat these people.
[01:23:48.211 --> 01:23:48.952]  Your take on that?
[01:23:49.552 --> 01:23:50.513]  I couldn't agree more.
[01:23:50.533 --> 01:23:54.815]  Those are two of the nicest things to happen to the United States Senate.
[01:23:55.464 --> 01:23:55.504]  In
[01:24:10.078 --> 01:24:12.739]  Adhering to the Constitution, and he ran off a number of things.
[01:24:12.979 --> 01:24:15.219]  He said, well then, please, call me a wacko-ber.
[01:24:16.340 --> 01:24:24.522]  His willingness to get into a scrap, not only willing, I think he came here looking for trouble because he... He's not stupid!
[01:24:24.542 --> 01:24:26.482]  That's the only way you stand out and make change!
[01:24:26.502 --> 01:24:28.703]  They're always saying, don't be loud, don't be aggressive.
[01:24:28.903 --> 01:24:29.563]  That's bull!
[01:24:29.843 --> 01:24:31.664]  They have bullied us long enough!
[01:24:32.224 --> 01:24:36.905]  One of my favorites about Senator Cruz, in the short time he's been here,
[01:24:37.671 --> 01:24:47.380]  On the Judiciary Committee, they were considering the gun control bill that they put out for a vote that happily lost, and Dianne Feinstein wanted to ban some guns.
[01:24:48.141 --> 01:25:00.153]  And his question to her was, well, I wonder if the senior senator from California could tell me that if her view that the Second Amendment only protects certain guns would also then correspond to
[01:25:00.615 --> 01:25:06.959]  The First Amendment only protecting certain speech and the Fourth Amendment only protecting certain houses.
[01:25:07.079 --> 01:25:07.319]  Sure.
[01:25:07.879 --> 01:25:10.241]  She went bananas.
[01:25:10.828 --> 01:25:24.213]  And she accused him of calling her a sixth grader, which I thought would be an insult to sixth graders, so I'm sure Senator Cruz... Oh, he was so polite and calm, exactly, with the logic, that's why that witch got so upset.
[01:25:24.493 --> 01:25:32.956]  Shifting gears again, I know you've seen the story about ATF arming robbers in hatch plots that they create themselves, similar to Fast and Furious.
[01:25:33.356 --> 01:25:35.877]  This came out in local ABC News channels
[01:25:36.357 --> 01:25:38.478]  And a few others, but hasn't gotten any attention.
[01:25:39.478 --> 01:25:42.079]  What's going on with Fast and Furious and other ATF scandals?
[01:25:42.459 --> 01:25:45.520]  And then what is their newest plan to go after our guns?
[01:25:46.061 --> 01:25:52.523]  Well, two more Mexicans have been murdered by thugs using a Fast and Furious gun.
[01:25:53.383 --> 01:26:03.327]  In this case, it was a, I believe it was a police chief of a Mexican town, or a mayor and his bodyguard, and wife of the guy was wounded.
[01:26:04.214 --> 01:26:13.138]  And it just goes on and on and nothing is going to be done because we don't really expect Eric Holder to prosecute Eric Holder.
[01:26:13.559 --> 01:26:33.068]  What is concerning me is that the House of Representatives, in a vote for criminal contempt, sent that vote, that approval of that resolution, over to the federal court for the District of Columbia and essentially became the prosecutor against the underlings of Eric Holder that, and Eric Holder, that had been
[01:26:33.604 --> 01:26:39.385]  Caught in outright lies under oath, and said we want these people prosecuted.
[01:26:39.946 --> 01:26:47.407]  The court, I understood before the election they weren't going to do anything, but now it's been over six months and they still haven't done anything.
[01:26:47.887 --> 01:27:00.570]  Clearly, the Washington establishment is not going to do anything to anybody that even gets involved in complicity to commit murder, which is what Fast and Furious was from the get-go.
[01:27:00.850 --> 01:27:03.171]  The intention was not to track guns,
[01:27:03.499 --> 01:27:12.503]  We know from what whistleblowers have told us the intention was always to make it look like folks like you and me are the bad guys because we own guns.
[01:27:12.643 --> 01:27:15.324]  Sure, that came out to CBS's credit.
[01:27:15.705 --> 01:27:19.907]  They got the internal memos that was to be blamed on the Second Amendment, a false flag.
[01:27:19.927 --> 01:27:22.088]  We've only got three minutes left with Larry Pratt.
[01:27:22.108 --> 01:27:23.388]  We'll go to break and come back with your calls.
[01:27:23.868 --> 01:27:25.449]  I've been asking a lot of the questions here.
[01:27:25.769 --> 01:27:30.191]  What else do you want to tell people about and alert people about that's going on?
[01:27:30.211 --> 01:27:31.172]  We've got California.
[01:27:31.992 --> 01:27:34.994]  Saying gotta get insurance or background checks to get bullets.
[01:27:35.014 --> 01:27:36.755]  You've got all this stuff happening.
[01:27:37.796 --> 01:27:38.757]  What else is on the radar?
[01:27:39.137 --> 01:27:42.259]  Well, I've got our attorneys studying the proposition.
[01:27:42.299 --> 01:27:55.548]  What would happen if a bunch of guys my age or somewhat younger went onto a school ground at lunchtime when probably everybody pretty much is outside and started playing cops and robbers with our fingers and our pop-tarts?
[01:27:56.269 --> 01:27:59.351]  And I suppose we could get charged with trespassing.
[01:28:00.161 --> 01:28:12.425]  But I'd like to know exactly what might be the result of that, because we need to educate children that a gun in a hand of somebody besides a police officer is not a bad thing.
[01:28:13.286 --> 01:28:22.709]  When that kid in West Virginia was put in a whole heap of trouble, Jared Markham, for having Defend the Right NRA
[01:28:24.139 --> 01:28:24.840]  And they arrested him?
[01:28:40.075 --> 01:28:42.976]  Effect on bringing some reason to these people.
[01:28:43.016 --> 01:28:45.496]  And having the prosecutor drop the case when he was going ahead with it.
[01:28:45.936 --> 01:28:48.957]  Again, we've just got to commend Gunners of America for what you're doing.
[01:28:48.977 --> 01:28:56.859]  So what you're saying is get on the offense culturally because they've got the kids in their clutches right now teaching them that even the image of a gun is illegal.
[01:28:57.479 --> 01:28:58.279]  Even the image.
[01:28:58.820 --> 01:29:04.501]  So I think we have to push back in whatever smart way we can do
[01:29:04.963 --> 01:29:12.347]  To make sure that kids see that, yeah, having a gun is just as much fun as you thought it was when you were shooting your buddy with a water pistol yesterday.
[01:29:12.987 --> 01:29:14.088]  It's not a bad thing.
[01:29:14.328 --> 01:29:17.769]  I'll tell you what's fun about it is having low crime and sleeping good at night.
[01:29:18.710 --> 01:29:22.332]  Yeah, that kind of beats living in Detroit or Chicago, doesn't it?
[01:29:22.892 --> 01:29:23.773]  It certainly does.
[01:29:24.213 --> 01:29:24.533]  Wow.
[01:29:24.593 --> 01:29:27.394]  Larry Pratt, Gun Owners of America, GunOwners.org.
[01:29:27.795 --> 01:29:32.377]  Everybody should go there, sign up for the free updates, or become a member and tell folks how they do that.

[01:29:46.804 --> 01:29:47.684]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[01:29:47.704 --> 01:29:48.125]  Thank you.
[01:29:48.285 --> 01:29:50.005]  Folks, without that group, we would have lost.
[01:29:50.285 --> 01:29:56.287]  We'll be right back with your phone calls, a ton of news, and Adam Kokesh will talk to us first about his armed march on D.C.
[01:29:56.307 --> 01:29:56.707]  He did it!
[01:29:58.748 --> 01:29:59.648]  We're on the march.
[01:30:00.148 --> 01:30:01.649]  The Empire's on the run.

[01:33:09.517 --> 01:33:16.459]  We need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[01:33:16.559 --> 01:33:20.061]  It's not about keeping guns out of the hands of law-abiding Americans.
[01:33:20.301 --> 01:33:23.122]  And I'm sick and tired of people lying to the American people.
[01:33:23.262 --> 01:33:26.643]  We can't have a totally armed society.
[01:33:26.963 --> 01:33:29.846]  We're not proposing a gun registration system.
[01:33:29.866 --> 01:33:32.129]  We're proposing background checks for criminals.
[01:33:32.770 --> 01:33:36.854]  In the spirit of gun control, will you disarm your entire security team?
[01:33:37.215 --> 01:33:38.576]  Uh, we'll get right back to you.
[01:33:38.596 --> 01:33:39.357]  You'll get back to me?
[01:33:39.417 --> 01:33:40.358]  Hitler took the guns.
[01:33:40.598 --> 01:33:41.660]  Stalin took the guns.
[01:33:41.940 --> 01:33:42.801]  Mao took the guns.
[01:33:43.021 --> 01:33:44.302]  Adel Castro took the guns.
[01:33:44.563 --> 01:33:45.724]  Hugo Chavez took the guns.
[01:33:45.884 --> 01:33:51.169]  And I'm here to tell you, 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms.
[01:33:51.189 --> 01:33:55.654]  It doesn't matter how many lemmings you get out there on the street begging for them to have their guns taken.
[01:33:55.834 --> 01:33:57.175]  We will not relinquish them.
[01:33:57.355 --> 01:33:58.296]  Do you understand?
[01:33:58.556 --> 01:33:59.377]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:33:59.417 --> 01:34:01.900]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:34:15.430 --> 01:34:21.596]  It's the big showdown, and we're beating Obama and the globalists on gutting our borders and creating a North American Union.
[01:34:21.976 --> 01:34:24.419]  We're beating them on their attempt to take our guns.
[01:34:24.899 --> 01:34:30.325]  We are beating them on so many fronts, and we will abolish the offshore Federal Reserve.
[01:34:30.385 --> 01:34:34.969]  We will kick the Rothschilds and Rockefellers out of this country, out of our banking system.
[01:34:34.989 --> 01:34:36.691]  We will restore the Republic.
[01:34:37.779 --> 01:34:39.760]  Now, we're going to go to your phone calls here in a few minutes.
[01:34:39.841 --> 01:34:43.743]  Adam Kokeshi is on now, and this happened on the 4th of July.
[01:34:43.763 --> 01:34:46.445]  He went ahead with his armed march on D.C.
[01:34:47.306 --> 01:34:56.553]  there between the Capitol and the White House, got out there in the morning, loaded the shotgun up, in his words, in a text to me, saying he committed four felonies.
[01:34:57.433 --> 01:35:03.218]  The issue here is the Supreme Court five years ago overthrew the ban on shotguns and handguns for citizens.
[01:35:04.622 --> 01:35:14.012]  But, just like courts have ordered Fast and Furious, the Justice Department to answer questions, they haven't done it in several years, and now in the latest ruling, six months.
[01:35:14.393 --> 01:35:15.294]  They are lawless!
[01:35:16.561 --> 01:35:20.465]  This is like Rosa Parks saying, I'm not going to sit at the back of the bus anymore.
[01:35:20.505 --> 01:35:22.527]  I'm going to sit up at the front where the air conditioning's at.
[01:35:23.088 --> 01:35:26.030]  It's because I'm black, doesn't mean I'm a second-class citizen.
[01:35:26.811 --> 01:35:32.117]  And D.C., the government has its guns, it's got its helicopters and rocket launchers, but you can't have a gun.
[01:35:32.557 --> 01:35:37.162]  So you can live in one of the highest crime rates in the country, just like Chicago, where they've taken the citizens' guns.
[01:35:37.768 --> 01:35:39.709]  And so he sent me a text right after it went live.
[01:35:39.729 --> 01:35:40.529]  I mean, he sent me the text.
[01:35:40.569 --> 01:35:40.949]  I looked at it.
[01:35:40.989 --> 01:35:43.390]  It had like 20 views on YouTube when he sent it to me.
[01:35:44.591 --> 01:35:45.712]  I saw it that morning.
[01:35:45.772 --> 01:35:47.612]  I called him, and he said, I'm not ready to come on right now.
[01:35:47.912 --> 01:35:48.733]  I'll talk to you next week.
[01:35:48.753 --> 01:35:53.175]  So he's giving us the first interview right now, and you can say what you want about him.
[01:35:53.815 --> 01:35:57.017]  But he's going straight into the wind on this, and that's how you make history.
[01:35:57.777 --> 01:36:00.259]  He's not closing his eyes in the face of adversity.
[01:36:01.159 --> 01:36:09.344]  And he is standing up for our civil and God-given and just unalienable, unalienable, basic human rights.
[01:36:09.384 --> 01:36:11.665]  And it's easy to say, you know, should he do an armed march?
[01:36:11.705 --> 01:36:13.426]  Should he do an armed march?
[01:36:13.486 --> 01:36:13.987]  Shouldn't he?
[01:36:14.387 --> 01:36:15.488]  The point is, you have a right.
[01:36:15.568 --> 01:36:17.669]  You can debate whether it's a good idea or a bad idea.
[01:36:19.175 --> 01:36:22.399]  But you cannot debate that he has courage and he has a right to do it.
[01:36:22.699 --> 01:36:25.762]  The question is, is now the time to call these people on their criminality?
[01:36:26.103 --> 01:36:37.615]  I think that's open for debate, but Adam has caused a debate, as I said Friday with Jakari Jackson, and has contributed to it, and our listeners have contributed as well, to
[01:36:38.576 --> 01:36:45.037]  Coming to that clarion call of a new Paul Revere, all of us are Paul Reveres, of every race, color, creed, sex, you name it.
[01:36:45.558 --> 01:36:49.098]  There were marches in all 50 states, some of them had thousands of people.
[01:36:49.538 --> 01:36:54.640]  I think, conservatively, there were probably 800 people from the news report Jakari Jackson filed at the Texas Capitol.
[01:36:54.920 --> 01:37:04.162]  And it was the impetus, the idea of Adam Kokesh, on the 4th of March, for the Second Amendment, that then even turned into an NSA protest in many states.
[01:37:04.222 --> 01:37:05.262]  So, big
[01:37:05.942 --> 01:37:07.482]  Big things have small beginnings.
[01:37:07.783 --> 01:37:14.505]  Let's go to this clip of his civil disobedience against the incredible tyranny of the foreign banks that have occupied DC.
[01:37:14.545 --> 01:37:14.985]  Here it is.
[01:37:15.385 --> 01:37:16.465]  We will not be silent.
[01:37:17.746 --> 01:37:18.686]  We will not obey.
[01:37:19.526 --> 01:37:24.648]  We will not allow our government to destroy our humanity.
[01:37:26.808 --> 01:37:34.451]  We are the final American revolution.
[01:37:35.445 --> 01:37:36.706]  See you next Independence Day.
[01:37:59.056 --> 01:38:01.157]  Well, Alex, I really appreciate that introduction.
[01:38:01.217 --> 01:38:02.298]  It's my pleasure to come on.
[01:38:02.318 --> 01:38:11.443]  This is the first formal interview that I've done since the event, and I'm more than happy to give this to you first, because you've been so supportive in this.
[01:38:11.543 --> 01:38:23.150]  But I want to draw a comparison with Rosa Parks, as you have, and I'm greatly honored by that, and the significance of her single act of civil disobedience really can't be measured.
[01:38:23.650 --> 01:38:27.712]  And I hope that in my lifetime I might have a similar impact.
[01:38:28.092 --> 01:38:30.453]  But you also made the comparison to Paul Revere.
[01:38:30.513 --> 01:38:43.698]  So if I may, the events that took place this past Independence Day with, as you pointed out, thousands marching throughout the country, were about a lot more than the Second Amendment or the Fourth Amendment or the NSA or gun rights in general.
[01:38:44.058 --> 01:38:47.539]  It was very specifically a call to overthrow the United States federal government.
[01:38:47.879 --> 01:38:54.402]  And I think that we have come to the point where we can get a critical mass of Americans to realize that we'd be better off without it than with it.
[01:38:55.062 --> 01:39:05.808]  And Rosa Parks, when she went to the front of the bus, it wasn't... Well, I think the government should be able to say who should be able to sit at the front of the bus, but it should only be white people and black people.
[01:39:05.888 --> 01:39:08.309]  Screw yellow people and red people and forget about them.
[01:39:08.329 --> 01:39:08.369]  No.
[01:39:08.849 --> 01:39:09.650]  We're good to go.
[01:39:24.671 --> 01:39:45.704]  And I feel like I have a much more important mission right now during this interview with you today, sir, than to spread the message about what happened on Independence Day, but to convince you of the appropriate course of action moving forward, because your audience and yourself have so much respect and carry so much power in this United States national conversation right now.
[01:39:46.464 --> 01:39:57.035]  And if we say, well, we have these rights, but we're going to restore the republic, we're going to be repeating the mistakes of the past by creating a central authority that is based on democratic concepts and values.
[01:39:57.055 --> 01:40:02.080]  Listen, listen, I want to get into that with you, and I want you to be able to say your piece.
[01:40:02.941 --> 01:40:16.925]  For me, and I've had a lot of constitutional lawyers like Edwin Vieira and countless others on, who agree that what I'm saying is out of the Declaration of Independence, Bill of Rights and Constitution, we don't even have a federal government.
[01:40:16.985 --> 01:40:18.706]  It's a foreign banking cartel.
[01:40:19.046 --> 01:40:23.387]  And if we point that out, then it's totally illegitimate and people get it.
[01:40:23.707 --> 01:40:24.968]  And I think it's going to be easier
[01:40:25.828 --> 01:40:34.272]  To at least restore the classic republic that's a million times better than the New World Order we've got, than just saying, let's overthrow the federal government.
[01:40:34.712 --> 01:40:36.072]  It's not even the federal government.
[01:40:36.253 --> 01:40:37.653]  The Federal Reserve is not federal.
[01:40:37.853 --> 01:40:41.915]  This is an alien, globalist, corporate kleptocracy in Europe.
[01:40:42.135 --> 01:40:44.356]  They brag that private banks have seized the countries.
[01:40:44.796 --> 01:40:48.618]  So my issue is I support you defending the individual right to bear arms.
[01:40:49.178 --> 01:40:56.727]  But I'm even giving you the legal argument the way that you'd probably win in court if they come after you, instead of just saying, I see you all as illegitimate criminals.
[01:40:57.368 --> 01:40:58.549]  I respect what you're saying.
[01:40:58.989 --> 01:41:06.919]  I respect the whole, you know, the anarchic capitalist, hyper libertarian, whatever you want to call yourself view.
[01:41:07.079 --> 01:41:07.619]  I get that.
[01:41:08.280 --> 01:41:11.962]  I'm simply saying that I think you have a lot of courage.
[01:41:11.982 --> 01:41:14.284]  This is overall a very positive thing you did.
[01:41:14.304 --> 01:41:15.665]  It was your individual choice.
[01:41:16.165 --> 01:41:18.006]  It didn't endanger a whole bunch of other people.
[01:41:18.046 --> 01:41:21.849]  So I wanted to speak specifically about that and then you can give us your view.
[01:41:22.189 --> 01:41:28.353]  But when you say a revolution, I want to have a psychological, cultural revolution against the globalists.
[01:41:28.593 --> 01:41:35.998]  So first, define your revolution and what you're saying and then let's get back to you locking and loading with the 12-gauge there in D.C.
[01:41:36.718 --> 01:41:37.999]  Sure, Alex, I appreciate that.
[01:41:38.019 --> 01:41:43.683]  And the revolution in the bigger picture, in the longer term, I'm absolutely with you, it's the paradigm shift.
[01:41:43.703 --> 01:41:49.367]  It's not the revolution, it's the evolution that people are going through of realizing that they have these rights.
[01:41:49.728 --> 01:41:55.392]  But the American founders, would you be the one telling them, oh, you shouldn't really shoot back at the King's soldiers,
[01:41:55.692 --> 01:42:01.775]  You should go send an emissary to King George and plead in his court for forgiveness, and you should plead for independence.
[01:42:02.135 --> 01:42:10.378]  No, the time then was to take a specific radical action, and fortunately in this day and age, violence is not required to achieve that.
[01:42:10.718 --> 01:42:14.900]  But we're not going to achieve this through democracy, through the voting process, through the courts.
[01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:21.863]  Well, I'll tell you this, if we saw 20-something governors and former senators and Ron Paul and people I respect
[01:42:22.803 --> 01:42:29.325]  Meeting in public, like in Philadelphia again, and then I heard ideas and saw plans that were sent to the states.
[01:42:29.345 --> 01:42:30.565]  You gotta have some organization.
[01:42:30.786 --> 01:42:36.287]  Well, no, let me ask you a question, Alex, because you talk about these rights, and it's very important to understand what these rights are.
[01:42:36.327 --> 01:42:43.369]  And again, going back to Rosa Parks, what she was protesting for was not for specific privileges under an existing system.
[01:42:43.669 --> 01:42:45.090]  She was protesting for
[01:42:45.350 --> 01:42:46.051]  No, I get it.
[01:42:46.091 --> 01:42:46.511]  This is a total...
[01:43:00.663 --> 01:43:05.385]  You want to restore the Republic, you're still going to have other people choosing a leader for me, and I reject that.
[01:43:05.765 --> 01:43:07.046]  But I see this in steps.
[01:43:07.206 --> 01:43:16.830]  I want to kick the New World Order out and expose their eugenics agenda and bring them to justice, and then out of that great victory, we could build an open, more free society.
[01:43:17.350 --> 01:43:28.502]  Okay, so I agree with a lot of your basic ideas and a lot of the hyper-libertarian ideas that I think were expressed by Thomas Jefferson more eloquently than I can do 200-plus years ago.
[01:43:28.943 --> 01:43:34.689]  I'm saying the globalists actually like revolutions because they can steer them into larger crises.
[01:43:37.225 --> 01:43:39.007]  That's why I think people have trepidation.
[01:43:39.307 --> 01:43:46.655]  That's why specifically what we are calling for here is an orderly, peaceful dissolution of the federal government.
[01:43:46.995 --> 01:43:52.180]  Not anything chaotic, which is what we face if we don't do anything, or if we take these half measures.
[01:43:52.220 --> 01:43:59.368]  And with all due respect, sir, I believe that what you're calling for is the definition of insanity, of trying the same thing over and expecting different results.
[01:43:59.748 --> 01:44:06.314]  And we can't fight inch by inch anymore, because you take an inch, and they're going to take a mile behind your back and laugh at you while they're doing it.
[01:44:06.614 --> 01:44:09.597]  And we have to get a critical mass of public support on our side.
[01:44:09.877 --> 01:44:16.582]  And you're not going to get a critical mass of public support saying, well, let's change this law, or let's tweak this, or let's not say this.
[01:44:16.703 --> 01:44:22.387]  I know a lot of government people that want to have some big showdown, and I historically
[01:44:23.348 --> 01:44:25.611]  We're winning in the awakening process.
[01:44:25.711 --> 01:44:26.451]  Absolutely.
[01:44:26.672 --> 01:44:29.274]  And I think this baby is five months pregnant.
[01:44:29.935 --> 01:44:35.041]  My gut tells me, people say, oh you just say that because you're a popular talk show host and have stuff to lose.
[01:44:35.441 --> 01:44:36.042]  That's not true.
[01:44:36.082 --> 01:44:39.165]  Folks, I go out and give speeches to thousands of people without bodyguards.
[01:44:39.265 --> 01:44:40.066]  I'm out in the open.
[01:44:40.666 --> 01:44:43.670]  I just, I mean, you're saying, let's have the revolution.
[01:44:44.190 --> 01:44:49.552]  They're all set up to try to have a civil war instead of a restoration of any type of freedom.
[01:44:49.932 --> 01:45:00.357]  And I believe the system of the Declaration of Independence that says it's our right, it's our duty to abolish forms that are abusive and set up new ones.
[01:45:00.817 --> 01:45:04.938]  Obviously, if we've got 101 million people on welfare in the U.S.
[01:45:04.998 --> 01:45:10.721]  right now, these people don't even know how to wipe their own hind ends, much less live in the society you're talking about.
[01:45:10.941 --> 01:45:13.602]  It's like Ron Paul said, America is in a coma.
[01:45:14.122 --> 01:45:16.423]  It's going to take time to get us out of this.
[01:45:16.923 --> 01:45:22.525]  Well, in a sense, I feel like I'm the moderate here because what I'm suggesting is that we maintain the state governments as they are.
[01:45:22.945 --> 01:45:38.691]  And what I'm suggesting specifically as a form for this revolution, this specific step that I think we can demand, that I think we can get a critical mass of people from behind, is to restore the authority of the states to go back to having independent, truly autonomous states.
[01:45:38.951 --> 01:45:40.813]  And this is something that can really unite people.
[01:45:40.853 --> 01:45:47.099]  See, there's a problem, Alex, when you say, let's have a republic, let's restore the republic, let's have this vision on the national level.
[01:45:47.420 --> 01:45:50.242]  It's one person's specific, particular vision.
[01:45:50.282 --> 01:45:51.644]  And if a lot of people share it, fine.
[01:45:51.904 --> 01:45:54.146]  But it's going to be forced on the entire country.
[01:45:54.427 --> 01:45:57.890]  But if you break it down at the state level, you can tell everyone.
[01:45:58.110 --> 01:45:58.831]  No, that's what I called for.
[01:45:58.851 --> 01:45:59.432]  Why stop there?
[01:45:59.452 --> 01:46:00.894]  Why would you cut a cancer out and leave 3% to grow back?
[01:46:16.653 --> 01:46:17.854]  Because it's not the cancer.
[01:46:17.914 --> 01:46:19.196]  The globalists came and took it over.
[01:46:19.716 --> 01:46:21.318]  People blame the republic for what's there.
[01:46:21.338 --> 01:46:22.118]  That's not a republic.
[01:46:22.258 --> 01:46:24.641]  That's a UN globalist fortress.
[01:46:25.041 --> 01:46:32.168]  If you leave 3%, the same forces will be there to take advantage of it and grow it back into a force of oppression.
[01:46:32.188 --> 01:46:35.611]  But you need the balance of the two sides against each other, separation of powers.
[01:46:35.872 --> 01:46:37.914]  They will also go into the states and take those over.
[01:46:38.334 --> 01:46:42.695]  The balance of power is that we fill the vacuum with self-governance.
[01:46:42.715 --> 01:46:43.895]  And that's the paradigm shift.
[01:46:43.915 --> 01:46:45.176]  That's where that comes in, sir.
[01:46:45.496 --> 01:46:49.317]  Where people are able to say, I am a free, beautiful, independent human being.
[01:46:49.437 --> 01:46:50.637]  I'm not going to allow anyone to take my life.
[01:46:50.657 --> 01:47:00.260]  I know, but when we have this level of domestication, when we have this level of domestication, 101 million people, they've gotten us dependent so that it'll be almost impossible to get off of it.
[01:47:00.600 --> 01:47:00.920]  I agree.
[01:47:00.940 --> 01:47:04.481]  It's like we're a heroin addict, but can we go cold turkey is what I'm asking you.
[01:47:05.071 --> 01:47:09.113]  I think there are a lot of people who are still going to be dependent on the state governments after what I'm suggesting.
[01:47:09.153 --> 01:47:15.955]  The only people I want to pull the rug out from underneath is the NSA and the IRS and a few other absolutely destructive... Well, they're foreign agents.
[01:47:15.975 --> 01:47:17.216]  Their leadership does need to be arrested.
[01:47:17.236 --> 01:47:17.796]  Absolutely.
[01:47:17.976 --> 01:47:18.536]  Absolutely.
[01:47:18.556 --> 01:47:21.897]  And if we pull the rug out from underneath them, I have no problem with that.
[01:47:22.157 --> 01:47:25.679]  But I'm not talking about a change in the actual mechanisms of governance.
[01:47:25.719 --> 01:47:31.381]  We'd still be living under state governments that provide the, you know, illusion of stability that you're talking about.
[01:47:31.681 --> 01:47:31.881]  Absolutely.
[01:47:31.901 --> 01:47:32.802]  Yes, and that's the question.
[01:47:47.429 --> 01:47:49.332]  Which direction do you want to go in, sir?
[01:47:49.432 --> 01:47:51.895]  Greater concentrations of power or lower?
[01:47:51.935 --> 01:47:53.777]  Do you want to bring it back to the individual?
[01:47:54.038 --> 01:47:57.723]  And if we go in that direction, compromise in a temporary situation.
[01:47:57.763 --> 01:48:02.168]  I want to take the federal government back over and I want to bring the people to justice that have taken the country over.
[01:48:02.489 --> 01:48:04.211]  Believe me, that'll send a very strong message.
[01:48:05.369 --> 01:48:14.214]  I'm a little, as much as I share your passion for that justice, I'm more concerned with the progress that we need to make right now as a species and get past this idea of central authority in the first place.
[01:48:14.475 --> 01:48:23.580]  But if you compromise in, you know, in the short term, you're going to get, you know... Alright, alright, well listen, listen, you did the provocative loading the shotgun, you have a lot of courage down there.
[01:48:23.940 --> 01:48:29.162]  I understand you want to be smart and leave it nebulous for legal reasons, but we got you on to talk about that specifically.
[01:48:29.182 --> 01:48:33.204]  I mean, talk about why you decided to do it, because some will try to say it's a blue screen.
[01:48:33.224 --> 01:48:34.745]  It does not look like a blue screen to me.
[01:48:34.825 --> 01:48:37.826]  You can hear the birds tweeting and the wind blowing on the microphone.
[01:48:37.846 --> 01:48:41.908]  I mean, if it is fake, you had Stanley Kubrick out there helping him.
[01:48:42.938 --> 01:48:44.179]  Well, that might just be the case.
[01:48:44.199 --> 01:48:45.640]  But no, it was a real shotgun.
[01:48:45.680 --> 01:48:52.745]  It was loaded and it was racked and had a round in the chamber in Freedom Plaza in Washington, D.C., in between the White House and the Capitol.
[01:48:53.385 --> 01:49:03.212]  And if anything, I did it at this point simply for follow-through, for the sake of my own credibility to show that I was willing to follow through with committing that particular act of civil disobedience on Independence Day.
[01:49:03.552 --> 01:49:05.113]  And a lot of people didn't understand this.
[01:49:05.153 --> 01:49:06.274]  A lot of people attacked me.
[01:49:06.314 --> 01:49:12.718]  A lot of it was government trolls, and we've seen the patterns of... Oh, it's easy for people that are on the bench to criticize those in the arena.
[01:49:13.058 --> 01:49:13.458]  Of course.
[01:49:14.098 --> 01:49:17.960]  And I'm sure you understand the exact same thing from your personal experience.
[01:49:17.980 --> 01:49:23.082]  But I want people to understand that this year, we simply didn't have the numbers for the march to get a critical mass in D.C.
[01:49:23.582 --> 01:49:34.246]  And with my arrest on May 18th in Philadelphia, to have an event that was based on an open carry march crossing a border, dependent on a single organizer, was not wise.
[01:49:34.346 --> 01:49:34.426]  Yes.
[01:49:56.653 --> 01:50:00.596]  He wants to end the Fed entirely to join us on Independence Day of next year.
[01:50:00.616 --> 01:50:12.365]  We're going to be doing the same route from Arlington Cemetery across Memorial Bridge, down Independence Avenue, around the Capitol and the Supreme Court, up Pennsylvania Avenue, around the White House, back down Constitution Avenue.
[01:50:12.745 --> 01:50:19.811]  But this time it's not about guns, and it really wasn't ever about guns as much as it was about the monopoly of force that the government has over the citizens.
[01:50:20.271 --> 01:50:34.962]  And wanting to put it in its place, but now it's time to build this critical mass, and I appreciate the opportunity to make this pitch and appeal to you and your audience, because I know a lot of people in your audience are with me on this point, philosophically and tactically, that it's time to say, let's end the federal government.
[01:50:35.002 --> 01:50:36.243]  Let's call for nothing less.
[01:50:36.323 --> 01:50:36.903]  I hear you.
[01:50:37.003 --> 01:50:39.765]  I just think you do it a favor, calling it the federal government.
[01:50:39.906 --> 01:50:42.768]  It really is a foreign alien banking combine.
[01:50:43.188 --> 01:50:43.588]  Fair enough.
[01:50:43.608 --> 01:50:45.350]  I mean, I just...
[01:50:46.190 --> 01:50:47.632]  I just want to try to get America back.
[01:50:47.652 --> 01:50:49.574]  All the more reason to not compromise.
[01:50:49.794 --> 01:50:51.576]  All the more reason to give no quarter.
[01:50:51.757 --> 01:50:54.540]  All the more reason to take it down to zero percent.
[01:50:54.980 --> 01:50:56.662]  Alright, AdamVsTheMan.com.
[01:50:56.762 --> 01:50:59.525]  Adam Kokesh, thank you so much for spending time with us.

[01:51:10.634 --> 01:51:15.278]  You think you've tried it all, and you still have yet to say, wow, I love how I'm feeling now.
[01:51:15.698 --> 01:51:23.704]  Imagine being able to eliminate a lot of your supplements and being able to get results all from one source that's been over-marketed, oversold, and under-delivered.
[01:51:23.785 --> 01:51:30.770]  The difference between this one supplement and all the others can be vast, and that difference will determine if you come alive or remain burdened.

[01:52:17.849 --> 01:52:18.589]  This capitalism?
[01:52:18.649 --> 01:52:24.771]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?

[01:54:52.479 --> 01:54:55.502]  I mean, it's an uphill battle just trying to get The Republic re-uploaded.
[01:54:58.197 --> 01:55:00.818]  I believe that the globalists would take over states just as easy.
[01:55:01.278 --> 01:55:02.798]  But we'll discuss that tomorrow.

[01:56:35.310 --> 01:56:36.371]  You know, let them grandstand.
[01:56:36.391 --> 01:56:38.051]  We already know the NSA listens to everything.
[01:56:38.332 --> 01:56:39.172]  We listen to everything.
[01:56:39.232 --> 01:56:40.152]  We're criminals, too.
[01:56:40.633 --> 01:56:44.215]  Leave Jason in Texas.
[01:56:44.295 --> 01:56:44.955]  You're on the air.
[01:56:45.015 --> 01:56:48.317]  Then we'll go to Ryan and others.
[01:56:48.357 --> 01:56:48.957]  John, go ahead.
[01:56:48.977 --> 01:56:49.417]  You're on the air.
[01:56:50.298 --> 01:56:50.718]  Hey, Alex.
[01:56:51.098 --> 01:56:51.378]  Hey, buddy.
[01:56:52.399 --> 01:57:02.804]  Listen, I just called in to tell a little story and not to flatter you, but to let your listeners know what I witnessed in your character this weekend.
[01:57:03.906 --> 01:57:10.047]  How you took the time with those white little haired old ladies and you took pictures.
[01:57:10.908 --> 01:57:12.788]  You were very giving of yourself.
[01:57:13.808 --> 01:57:22.350]  I just thought that was a really good way you presented yourself, which is different than what people see on the TV and the radio.
[01:57:23.310 --> 01:57:29.671]  And also Chuck Baldwin, I don't know if you saw his sermon this weekend, he gave a shout out to you.
[01:57:30.252 --> 01:57:32.092]  And the reason that people need to hear this
[01:57:32.737 --> 01:57:42.884]  It's because I've been researching this conspiracy stuff and listening to a bunch of these radio talk show hosts, and some of them have disparaging things to say, and I say fully on them.
[01:57:43.685 --> 01:57:47.607]  I saw Christ in your actions this weekend.
[01:57:47.647 --> 01:57:48.668]  I say amen to that.
[01:57:48.728 --> 01:57:50.769]  And let me tell you something about the Georgia State Patrol.
[01:57:52.350 --> 01:57:53.191]  Sure.
[01:57:53.431 --> 01:57:59.375]  Okay, listen, uh, some guy that goes to my church or, uh, he's a state patrolman.
[01:57:59.395 --> 01:58:00.916]  He just became a state patrolman.
[01:58:00.956 --> 01:58:01.677]  He's a young guy.
[01:58:02.552 --> 01:58:10.595]  And the cockiness, the arrogance, the way he struts around that church, it makes me sick.
[01:58:10.695 --> 01:58:11.675]  It's embarrassing.
[01:58:12.196 --> 01:58:13.236]  It's embarrassing.
[01:58:13.796 --> 01:58:14.056]  Yeah.
[01:58:14.677 --> 01:58:18.498]  I mean, I grew up around a whole bunch of World War II vets that were all highly decorated.
[01:58:18.758 --> 01:58:21.019]  They were super meek, nice people.
[01:58:21.619 --> 01:58:24.640]  I grew up around people that were, you know, top boxers.
[01:58:24.700 --> 01:58:26.221]  They didn't act like they were tough guys.
[01:58:27.141 --> 01:58:27.421]  Stay there.
[01:58:27.441 --> 01:58:28.922]  I want to come back and hear about this because
[01:58:29.662 --> 01:58:35.707]  They are instilling this arrogance and they're hiring like crazy Barney Fives, basically, on steroids.
[01:58:36.148 --> 01:58:40.231]  And we don't need Barney Five folks in a SWAT team uniform.
[01:58:40.251 --> 01:58:42.112]  We need Andy.
[01:58:43.053 --> 01:58:43.874]  That's what we need.
[01:58:44.194 --> 01:58:46.256]  We'll be right back in 70 seconds.
[01:58:46.636 --> 01:58:47.617]  Stay there, Jason.

[02:00:18.914 --> 02:00:19.735]  You want answers?
[02:00:20.495 --> 02:00:21.395]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:22.055 --> 02:00:25.696]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:26.236 --> 02:00:30.358]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:31.458 --> 02:00:37.339]  Alright, I have got a heapin' helpin' of key news coming up on a host of issues, but let's go right back to your calls.
[02:00:38.520 --> 02:00:42.241]  Jason was talking about somebody he knows that just became a Georgia State Trooper.
[02:00:43.354 --> 02:01:00.003]  And man, I mean, I tell you, I don't see this with all the cops, but I'm seeing more of it, where they're either like, look like criminal types with the shaved heads and tattoos, and I'm not saying tattoos are bad, but you know what I mean, that type, bugging their eyes out like they want to get in a fight with you, or they're strutting around like...
[02:01:00.803 --> 02:01:04.087]  Like Barney Fife, but on steroids and real aggressive.
[02:01:04.388 --> 02:01:09.815]  I mean, all over the country, they pull you over with no warrant, shove their hands in your wife's body.
[02:01:09.835 --> 02:01:12.077]  I mean, I don't think I can put up with that.
[02:01:12.137 --> 02:01:14.721]  I mean, it's just the government has gone crazy.
[02:01:15.542 --> 02:01:19.366]  And I think that's why I was listening to talk radio yesterday before my own Sunday show.
[02:01:20.751 --> 02:01:27.458]  I heard at least 10 callers when the talk show host was basically defending police coming to your house now saying we need to come into your home.
[02:01:27.778 --> 02:01:29.920]  Not like there's a hostage situation next door.
[02:01:30.421 --> 02:01:32.543]  You could say extenuating, you know, emergency.
[02:01:32.963 --> 02:01:37.968]  It's we just want to surveil your neighbor, let us, and then arresting and roughing them up because they said no.
[02:01:38.729 --> 02:01:44.712]  I mean, it's just getting more and more pushy, more and more lock everything down, control everything, where you're the new royalty.
[02:01:45.153 --> 02:01:46.393]  That's how royalty happens.
[02:01:46.894 --> 02:01:52.897]  Somebody in, you know, the ancient times got a bunch of armed people together and they took over and said everybody had to kiss their butt.
[02:01:53.437 --> 02:01:54.318]  I don't want to live under that.
[02:01:54.338 --> 02:01:55.218]  I want to live in a free country.
[02:01:55.238 --> 02:02:00.721]  But, Jason, finish your story and then we'll go to Ryan and George.
[02:02:00.761 --> 02:02:01.642]  I appreciate everybody holding.
[02:02:02.062 --> 02:02:02.702]  Go ahead, Jason.
[02:02:03.463 --> 02:02:04.823]  Well, the bottom line is this.
[02:02:05.084 --> 02:02:07.465]  You just got a young 20-something year old kid.
[02:02:07.972 --> 02:02:12.337]  He's being pumped up with this propaganda and he actually believes it.
[02:02:12.758 --> 02:02:17.563]  And he just, it's like you said this weekend, I can't be mad at him.
[02:02:17.683 --> 02:02:18.624]  I'm sad for him.
[02:02:18.945 --> 02:02:19.465]  It hurts.
[02:02:19.645 --> 02:02:21.728]  He thinks he's serving Christ and he's not.
[02:02:23.271 --> 02:02:25.413]  Well, I mean, I've done a lot of things when I was 22, 23, 20.
[02:02:25.973 --> 02:02:29.315]  I was already on the air, but I had a pretty wild, seen a lot of things.
[02:02:29.656 --> 02:02:43.786]  But I would still be... I would be nervous, even if I was a good guy and it was a public safety issue, to be pulling people over and writing tickets and deal... I mean, I get why they've got to get control freaks to do it, because I wouldn't want to do that.
[02:02:44.266 --> 02:02:46.408]  But, I mean, the way that, you know, they pull you over
[02:02:47.108 --> 02:02:49.470]  And you know you weren't speeding and they want to search your car.
[02:02:50.030 --> 02:02:52.192]  And you look and the guy even knows who you are.
[02:02:52.652 --> 02:02:53.773]  And knows you're not, you know.
[02:02:53.973 --> 02:02:56.655]  And then the government is shipping the drugs in.
[02:02:57.575 --> 02:03:00.998]  And you're being cased, basically, by the state police.
[02:03:01.338 --> 02:03:03.699]  And to see the conversion.
[02:03:03.840 --> 02:03:04.940]  Everybody sees this.
[02:03:05.641 --> 02:03:07.542]  And the good news is, I see people waking up.
[02:03:07.842 --> 02:03:10.044]  Did you say anything to him when he was strutting around?
[02:03:11.129 --> 02:03:12.389]  Uh, of course not.
[02:03:12.469 --> 02:03:17.191]  I mean, I just sat there and observed it, and it just, it sickened me.
[02:03:17.731 --> 02:03:34.075]  And, you know... Well, listen, listen, all the time, I'll go to different churches and stuff, they'll have police there and security at a lot of these churches, and, you know, I'll see the cops, they know who I am, obviously, they're staring at me, and then they'll just have this wide-open look like they're reading me, not like they're just looking at me, and I'll turn and just be like, hey, how's it going?
[02:03:34.495 --> 02:03:37.896]  But it's like, at a certain point, I don't like being looked at like I've done something.
[02:03:38.615 --> 02:03:40.317]  You know, it's kind of like, what are you looking at, man?
[02:03:40.998 --> 02:03:42.039]  You know, I mean, what is this?
[02:03:42.119 --> 02:03:47.004]  I mean, if it was a plainclothes person on the street, I would think it was a gang member or something.
[02:03:47.024 --> 02:03:47.765]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[02:03:47.785 --> 02:03:49.747]  Oh, I understand completely.
[02:03:49.767 --> 02:03:50.668]  Listen, let me say one thing.
[02:03:50.728 --> 02:03:51.589]  I'll let you go up.
[02:03:52.293 --> 02:03:54.455]  I come across the preacher here in Houston.
[02:03:54.836 --> 02:03:56.097]  His name is Vody Baucom.
[02:03:56.617 --> 02:03:57.278]  He's a black guy.
[02:03:57.318 --> 02:03:58.179]  He's a Southern Baptist.
[02:03:58.279 --> 02:03:59.200]  One of the few good ones.
[02:03:59.600 --> 02:04:04.065]  But he actually has a big long article why he supports Ron Paul.
[02:04:04.605 --> 02:04:10.691]  And so that he may be one of the only Southern Baptist preachers that I've come across that support Ron Paul.
[02:04:11.452 --> 02:04:14.054]  So anybody out there in Houston need to check him out.
[02:04:14.134 --> 02:04:14.875]  Vody Baucom.
[02:04:15.296 --> 02:04:15.876]  What's his name again?
[02:04:15.896 --> 02:04:16.577]  How do you spell it?
[02:04:17.472 --> 02:04:22.475]  V-O-D-D-I-E, Balcom, B-A-U-C-H-A-M.
[02:04:23.236 --> 02:04:23.916]  No, that is good.
[02:04:23.956 --> 02:04:25.337]  They've bought off the Southern Baptists.
[02:04:25.357 --> 02:04:30.661]  They're calling for us to turn our guns in, and next abortion's gonna be good, as long as you slice the child up properly.
[02:04:31.761 --> 02:04:33.923]  Absolutely amazing to see what they're turning into.
[02:04:33.943 --> 02:04:35.864]  Okay, thanks, Alex.
[02:04:35.904 --> 02:04:36.664]  Keep up the good work.
[02:04:36.685 --> 02:04:37.025]  Thank you.
[02:04:37.045 --> 02:04:37.845]  Good to hear from you.
[02:04:37.885 --> 02:04:42.889]  Yeah, it's a nightmare when you've got all this type of garbage going on.
[02:04:44.105 --> 02:04:49.511]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we'll be back straight ahead with Ryan and then George.
[02:04:49.971 --> 02:04:54.576]  Well, John's up next and then Bill.
[02:04:54.596 --> 02:04:54.896]  800-259-9231.
[02:04:55.377 --> 02:04:57.359]  Nobody can say they should be bored right now.
[02:04:57.699 --> 02:05:02.844]  You've got front row seats to the New World Order and everything that comes with it.
[02:05:03.205 --> 02:05:06.048]  Get geared up and fight it or kneel and become slaves.
[02:05:09.420 --> 02:05:13.983]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[02:05:14.143 --> 02:05:17.105]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[02:05:17.265 --> 02:05:22.509]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[02:05:22.829 --> 02:05:24.450]  It all comes down to one thing.
[02:05:24.750 --> 02:05:26.091]  We are what we eat.
[02:05:26.391 --> 02:05:30.733]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[02:05:31.053 --> 02:05:35.035]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[02:05:35.295 --> 02:05:37.616]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[02:05:37.836 --> 02:05:43.779]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[02:07:13.688 --> 02:07:15.969]  Coffee shops, airports, libraries.
[02:07:16.550 --> 02:07:20.473]  But, using public Wi-Fi means that people can spy on you.
[02:07:20.773 --> 02:07:25.637]  And it's easy as... Yep, they can access your data at the touch of a button.
[02:07:26.237 --> 02:07:31.341]  Seriously, even your internet service provider can see every website you ever go to.
[02:07:32.122 --> 02:07:34.803]  Private Internet access has got your back.
[02:07:35.323 --> 02:07:35.603]  How?
[02:07:36.223 --> 02:07:43.725]  Well, it's kinda nerdy, but to put it simply, spies and companies that track you don't like us one bit.

[02:08:19.694 --> 02:08:21.094]  This is our land.
[02:08:24.298 --> 02:08:25.719]  These are our people.
[02:08:27.620 --> 02:08:28.360]  The workers.
[02:08:28.560 --> 02:08:31.402]  The strivers.
[02:08:31.482 --> 02:08:34.063]  The builders.
[02:08:34.163 --> 02:08:37.525]  These are our people.
[02:08:37.625 --> 02:08:40.827]  Who are they?
[02:08:40.987 --> 02:08:43.268]  They are the dark armies.
[02:08:43.788 --> 02:08:49.831]  The dark murdering armies whose only honour is atrocity.
[02:08:49.871 --> 02:08:50.992]  The answer to 1984.
[02:08:55.622 --> 02:09:08.975]  Alright, we're going right back to your phone calls.
[02:09:10.596 --> 02:09:14.079]  Then we're going to cover some of the breaking news at InfoWars.com.
[02:09:14.580 --> 02:09:17.542]  Obama supporters sign petition to repeal the Bill of Rights.
[02:09:18.801 --> 02:09:25.127]  Point Blank asked, this is not a joke, this is not even edited, I mean they edited out the spaces, but this is how they answered.
[02:09:25.147 --> 02:09:28.170]  The vast majority, ban the Bill of Rights for Obama.
[02:09:29.691 --> 02:09:32.433]  You could say again, jump off a cliff for Obama, and they would say yes.
[02:09:32.854 --> 02:09:38.799]  Ron Paul said to launch new Freedom Media Network, turn off your TV, turn on the truth, great catchphrase.
[02:09:38.819 --> 02:09:42.282]  I actually have a similar one coming out about kill your television set.
[02:09:43.536 --> 02:09:47.179]  Kill the dinosaur media by withdrawing your support.
[02:09:47.239 --> 02:09:51.322]  Introduce your children to Shizo, the transgender superhero.
[02:09:51.482 --> 02:09:51.923]  That's right.
[02:09:52.363 --> 02:09:54.385]  Confuse your children's gender.
[02:09:54.825 --> 02:09:56.466]  And if the chemicals don't do it, that will.
[02:09:57.067 --> 02:10:00.650]  Possible Egyptian interim prime minister is a globalist operative.
[02:10:01.752 --> 02:10:05.855]  Threats to riot, loot, if Zimmerman found innocent, intensify.
[02:10:05.875 --> 02:10:16.123]  You gotta go read these tweets on InfoWars.com and ask why a kid from south of Austin on a video game chat was going, oh yeah, I'm gonna shoot people, like joking when they were calling him names.
[02:10:17.143 --> 02:10:23.906]  He's getting six months in jail, but if you say you're going to organize and burn and kill and murder and you're liberal, that means authoritarian, then it's okay.
[02:10:24.566 --> 02:10:28.588]  TSA conducted pat-downs of family members of plane crash victims.
[02:10:28.628 --> 02:10:29.208]  That's right.
[02:10:29.849 --> 02:10:30.869]  No one can be trusted.
[02:10:30.909 --> 02:10:32.090]  We must put our hands on you.
[02:10:33.130 --> 02:10:35.651]  And Ron Paul's new article, New Egyptian War.
[02:10:35.951 --> 02:10:38.092]  America loses again, but the globalists win.
[02:10:38.733 --> 02:10:39.793]  And massacre in Egypt.
[02:10:39.853 --> 02:10:41.574]  Dozens of Morrissey supporters killed.
[02:10:41.954 --> 02:10:44.955]  And you know, we cover that when
[02:10:47.003 --> 02:10:50.266]  Morrisey people are being killed.
[02:10:51.066 --> 02:10:51.567]  We covered it.
[02:10:52.227 --> 02:10:59.793]  But when it's Al-Qaeda killing people over there for no reason, our media will not pick it up, but we've been covering it.
[02:11:00.374 --> 02:11:02.375]  Because that's the group our government is supporting.
[02:11:03.396 --> 02:11:06.078]  Absolutely, absolutely outrageous.
[02:11:07.079 --> 02:11:10.982]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ryan in Wisconsin.
[02:11:11.523 --> 02:11:12.964]  Thanks for holding, Ryan, you're on the air.
[02:11:14.110 --> 02:11:20.332]  Hey Alex, I just wanted to comment real quick on Mr. Gokesh.
[02:11:20.392 --> 02:11:23.793]  I think he's directly over the target, so to speak.
[02:11:23.813 --> 02:11:28.975]  I think, yeah, it's troublesome, I suppose.
[02:11:29.595 --> 02:11:39.118]  If things were to ignite, they would definitely try to use that against the movement as far as gun control and the right to bear arms.
[02:11:40.545 --> 02:11:50.618]  Um, you know, it's like Gerald Clancy always said, 20% of the people that come together, that's all we realistically need in order to make things happen.
[02:11:50.638 --> 02:11:51.680]  20% of the American people.
[02:11:53.262 --> 02:11:57.828]  And, you know, I think that a lot of the liberal side, unfortunately,
[02:11:59.049 --> 02:12:05.178]  I live in Madison, Wisconsin right now, and I'm actually from Colorado, so I'm very familiar with liberal ideology.
[02:12:05.259 --> 02:12:09.465]  I speak with a lot of people that have that kind of academia mindset.
[02:12:11.294 --> 02:12:26.644]  Yeah, they think they're right on pretty much every level, but when it comes to guns, they all seem to have that same idea or understanding that it's just not worth it to have guns and go to that length.
[02:12:26.664 --> 02:12:29.586]  They don't quite understand, they're not putting the pieces together.
[02:12:31.227 --> 02:12:43.056]  I think liberals have had a lot of traction in the political arena longer than the conservatives have as far as being active in politics.
[02:12:43.797 --> 02:12:49.641]  So I think what would be great to see if Adam Kokesh could
[02:12:50.442 --> 02:13:04.468]  Grab a lot of these and he does appear at least on the surface to be a lot like or he could easily grab a lot of those liberal thinking minds and pull them down into uh into where where we're at.
[02:13:04.788 --> 02:13:09.330]  Well I mean here's the issue I don't think Adam Kokesh is a bad guy I think he's interesting I think he's smart.
[02:13:10.379 --> 02:13:21.672]  But he was phrasing it in the interview earlier, like, Alex, I don't know if you could speak for everybody and say that you want the revolution to be a restoration of our republic.
[02:13:22.874 --> 02:13:25.937]  What we need is the states to be by themselves.
[02:13:26.758 --> 02:13:28.480]  And it's like, that's not even what I'm saying.
[02:13:28.620 --> 02:13:32.343]  I'm giving my view that I think that's what we should do.
[02:13:32.824 --> 02:13:44.634]  And really, Adam is kind of putting out his idea of leadership and then classically, I guess he did do psych warfare in the Marines, turning it around like I'm the one saying I'm the leader.
[02:13:45.435 --> 02:13:47.256]  And I mean, that's fine.
[02:13:47.316 --> 02:13:48.718]  He handles it all deftly.
[02:13:49.198 --> 02:13:50.699]  He goes and does these PR events.
[02:13:51.761 --> 02:14:01.106]  And then, I'm getting him on about one thing, about what he did down there, and he confirmed he did do it, and then it turns into his idea for next year, which is fine.
[02:14:01.306 --> 02:14:02.667]  I'd have him on to promote ideas.
[02:14:02.687 --> 02:14:09.590]  I mean, I think we should all promote July 4th marches about whatever issue it is that you're concerned with.
[02:14:10.811 --> 02:14:14.193]  So I'm not criticizing Adam, I'm just aware of what he's doing when he's on air.
[02:14:15.574 --> 02:14:18.256]  I don't sit here and really come up with a plan of what I'm going to say.
[02:14:18.616 --> 02:14:22.639]  I know the info, I've done the research, and it's really just from my heart.
[02:14:24.101 --> 02:14:34.709]  And my gut tells me that we're not going to get, and I'm not even sure I want, a total end to the federal government at this stage of human development.
[02:14:35.290 --> 02:14:39.073]  Because there's all these other big governments that will come in and take us over.
[02:14:40.013 --> 02:14:44.619]  That's the necessary evil of some government our founders believed in 237 years ago or 236 years ago.
[02:14:48.052 --> 02:15:12.032]  Now do we really think we know more than men that actually won a revolution, a good revolution, one of the few times in history and beat the greatest empire the planet had ever seen and put everything on the line and actually executed it for seven and a half years and did it and then built the country that became the freest and the wealthiest the world's ever seen and now has been infested by criminals because we were the shining city on the hill?
[02:15:13.945 --> 02:15:20.524]  And I'm just, I'm telling you, I've actually read the writings of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Paine.
[02:15:21.974 --> 02:15:22.374]  All of them.
[02:15:22.414 --> 02:15:26.856]  We've got a quote up on Infowars.com by one of the founders up there about government.
[02:15:27.256 --> 02:15:33.639]  And it's the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home.
[02:15:34.159 --> 02:15:35.099]  That was James Madison.
[02:15:35.740 --> 02:15:43.683]  So I get Adam's point about if you build some, you know, huge, giant, overreaching
[02:15:44.583 --> 02:15:52.792]  ...overarching thing to defend against a great enemy overseas, the domestic system you set up for it will just become what it was originally fighting.
[02:15:53.052 --> 02:15:54.414]  And that's the nature of power.
[02:15:55.135 --> 02:16:00.280]  That's why the police are getting more and more imperious, more and more arrogant, more and more power-grabbing.
[02:16:01.221 --> 02:16:19.573]  It's a revolt of the bureaucrats, the judges, the power structure, as they get bigger pensions, and as they get bigger raises, and as they get more power, and as they all get together in kind of a mafia psychology and hype each other up that what they're doing is okay.
[02:16:21.214 --> 02:16:22.455]  So I fully understand it.
[02:16:23.196 --> 02:16:30.541]  And I understand the dangers, though, in trying to be transported directly to some libertarian heaven.
[02:16:31.537 --> 02:16:40.782]  Some anarchic capitalist Valhalla up there with Thor and Odin and the Tree of Life and Ragnarok and Guder Dameron.
[02:16:41.222 --> 02:16:42.923]  I just don't see that happening.
[02:16:43.083 --> 02:16:46.284]  I'm trying to desperately beat them getting all our guns.
[02:16:46.945 --> 02:16:49.886]  I'm trying to desperately beat them kidnapping people's kids en masse.
[02:16:50.146 --> 02:16:53.948]  I mean, look, I want Adam Kokesh to talk about fluoride in the water and
[02:16:55.749 --> 02:17:16.849]  I mean, if somebody called for a revolution to go start arresting these health department people with the proof, bring it to the grand juries, and they do nothing, then take action, that, hey, they're giving people cancer viruses in these particular shots, here's the proof, or, hey, we need to start, you know, suing, and if that doesn't work, whatever, to stop them putting fluoride in the water, which they know is killing us.
[02:17:19.608 --> 02:17:20.809]  But, oh, you don't cover that?
[02:17:20.849 --> 02:17:22.670]  That's what the kooky right-wingers talk about.
[02:17:22.690 --> 02:17:30.294]  I mean, this is so much bigger, folks, and incredibly complex, and I eat, drink, and sleep the research of this, but I appreciate your call, Ryan.
[02:17:31.615 --> 02:17:37.418]  And so I'm mainly aloud musing here, musing aloud about this.
[02:17:38.139 --> 02:17:39.640]  It's just, he's like, let's get rid of the Fed.
[02:17:39.720 --> 02:17:40.820]  It's not even the Fed.
[02:17:43.002 --> 02:17:44.462]  It's like the movie The Thing from the 1980s.
[02:17:46.834 --> 02:17:49.878]  Where it looks like the federal government, it doesn't really.
[02:17:49.898 --> 02:17:52.180]  I mean, it looks like Nazi Germany.
[02:17:52.200 --> 02:17:53.262]  It looks like Soviet Russia.
[02:17:53.482 --> 02:17:54.743]  It looks exactly like what it is.
[02:17:54.783 --> 02:17:59.509]  A big, fat, out-of-control tyranny gearing up for all-out takeover against us.
[02:18:00.010 --> 02:18:01.191]  In a designed collapse.
[02:18:01.231 --> 02:18:02.473]  I mean, it's bad.
[02:18:03.840 --> 02:18:06.181]  And so my point is, there isn't even a federal government!
[02:18:06.241 --> 02:18:08.362]  I mean, get this thing out of here!
[02:18:08.862 --> 02:18:22.188]  Get the National Security State of 1947, when the private banks and the Skull & Bones Group, on record, were able to set up the National Security Act, where they get all the money, all the secrecy, license to kill, whatever they want.
[02:18:22.328 --> 02:18:23.368]  I say that's illegitimate!
[02:18:23.648 --> 02:18:24.969]  I say they've robbed us blind!
[02:18:25.269 --> 02:18:29.191]  I say, being given the keys to the kingdom, they abused the hell out of this place!
[02:18:30.455 --> 02:18:31.316]  And of course they have!
[02:18:31.436 --> 02:18:33.157]  I mean, it's totally illegitimate.
[02:18:33.377 --> 02:18:34.298]  It's a giant fraud.
[02:18:34.318 --> 02:18:35.418]  Let's go to John in New York.
[02:18:35.639 --> 02:18:36.439]  Thanks for holding, John.
[02:18:36.459 --> 02:18:36.899]  You're on the air.
[02:18:36.919 --> 02:18:39.281]  Thank you for taking my call.
[02:18:39.321 --> 02:18:41.042]  I have an important comment to say.
[02:18:41.643 --> 02:18:47.367]  I went to my local library to check Mark Dice's, if they have Mark Dice's book, The Resistance Manifesto.
[02:18:47.927 --> 02:18:52.390]  They didn't have it, so I checked this website called WaltzCats.org.
[02:18:52.430 --> 02:18:53.651]  Are you familiar with that site?
[02:18:55.626 --> 02:19:02.849]  Well, at this site, you could type in any book, periodical, DVD, and they will tell you all the libraries in the world which have that certain book.
[02:19:03.410 --> 02:19:11.033]  So I typed in the Resistance Manifesto by Mark Dice, and I found only seven libraries in the country have that book.
[02:19:11.233 --> 02:19:11.934]  Absolutely.
[02:19:11.954 --> 02:19:14.435]  You know, I've said this a hundred times, and I'll hold you over to finish your point.
[02:19:14.455 --> 02:19:15.175]  We're going to break.
[02:19:15.675 --> 02:19:19.297]  But everyone should give a... Let me grab it.
[02:19:20.669 --> 02:19:27.553]  Monthly, yearly, twelve big color glossy magazine periodicals to your library.
[02:19:27.853 --> 02:19:33.596]  Twelve of these will then be mailed to the library and people will end up reading them.
[02:19:34.217 --> 02:19:35.698]  And especially the bumper sticker issue.
[02:19:35.718 --> 02:19:38.159]  If you were to do this right now, your local library would get this.
[02:19:38.879 --> 02:19:41.241]  Donate my films to the local library.
[02:19:41.841 --> 02:19:43.262]  Donate books to the local library.
[02:19:43.582 --> 02:19:48.465]  After you've read a book, go and donate it and it will, like a message in a bottle, go out and reach people.
[02:19:49.270 --> 02:19:52.453]  Uh, but absolutely, uh, I am familiar with those database sites.
[02:19:53.934 --> 02:19:59.078]  Look, look, I, you know, do things like stick bumper stickers on my own property.
[02:19:59.498 --> 02:20:01.400]  I do things like talk to people at grocery stores.
[02:20:01.780 --> 02:20:03.161]  I don't just sit up here and do it on air.
[02:20:03.461 --> 02:20:06.684]  The real way to win this is to have you go out and reach out to people.
[02:20:07.064 --> 02:20:08.405]  Stay with us, we'll come right back to John.
[02:20:09.488 --> 02:20:14.012]  We all know the terrible damage that viruses and bacteria can inflict in the human body.
[02:20:14.293 --> 02:20:23.681]  Dozens of diseases are caused by infectious organisms, and now the emergence of superbugs that are resistant to antibiotics poses an even bigger threat to our safety.
[02:20:24.202 --> 02:20:28.206]  Don't wait for the medical world to discover a new treatment for the latest superbug.
[02:20:28.606 --> 02:20:33.371]  It's important to realize that a simple, safe, and effective alternative already exists.

[02:22:08.968 --> 02:22:12.091]  Oklahoma reminds us there are many kinds of storms in our lives.
[02:22:12.451 --> 02:22:15.053]  Nature regularly sends us destructive storms.
[02:22:15.513 --> 02:22:18.055]  24 hours before a storm strikes, people panic.
[02:22:18.335 --> 02:22:21.578]  It would be wise to prepare ahead of the panic curve.
[02:22:21.778 --> 02:22:28.023]  The food price storm from drought and livestock problems is forecast to hit ridiculous heights by the end of the summer.
[02:22:28.303 --> 02:22:29.944]  Wonder if there'll really be a problem?
[02:22:30.344 --> 02:22:36.047]  eFoods Direct has a plan to maximize your food dollar and guarantee you'll be glad you ordered food.

[02:23:08.425 --> 02:23:09.445]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:23:09.545 --> 02:23:13.846]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:23:14.026 --> 02:23:19.647]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:23:19.747 --> 02:23:23.068]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:23:23.308 --> 02:23:25.869]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:23:25.989 --> 02:23:30.790]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:23:30.950 --> 02:23:31.170]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:23:31.190 --> 02:23:32.550]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:23:37.711 --> 02:23:41.794]  When you need it the most, will your generator, power equipment, or vehicle be ready?
[02:23:41.954 --> 02:23:49.180]  Gas and diesel fuels go bad quickly when stored, and more than half of generator failures during disasters occur as a result of expired fuel.
[02:23:49.360 --> 02:23:53.323]  PRI Fuel Stabilizers keep your fuel fresh for when you need it most.
[02:23:53.443 --> 02:23:59.388]  Nuclear power stations, emergency service providers, and ships at sea rely on PRI Fuel Stabilizers.
[02:23:59.528 --> 02:24:00.248]  And you can too!
[02:24:00.268 --> 02:24:02.170]  Call 888-776-9373 or visit priproducts.com to find the dealer nearest you.
[02:24:10.383 --> 02:24:19.291]  Alright folks, Alex Jones of InfoWars.com back here live.
[02:24:20.132 --> 02:24:22.615]  Let's go right back to John who got cut off by the break.
[02:24:23.355 --> 02:24:24.756]  Let me guess, I stole your thunder.
[02:24:24.796 --> 02:24:31.342]  The idea is people need to put libertarian, patriot, anti-new world order type material in the libraries.
[02:24:32.143 --> 02:24:38.988]  But I like my day even more of giving people a gift subscription, a yearly subscription, to InfoWars Magazine.
[02:24:39.028 --> 02:24:40.009]  The shipping's included.
[02:24:40.069 --> 02:24:41.089]  It's a one-time deal.
[02:24:41.650 --> 02:24:43.091]  Twelve of these will be delivered.
[02:24:43.391 --> 02:24:44.572]  Give it to the police department.
[02:24:44.592 --> 02:24:45.432]  Give it to the library.
[02:24:45.713 --> 02:24:46.953]  Give it to your state rep.
[02:24:47.414 --> 02:24:50.456]  And then they will get twelve of these into their office.
[02:24:50.496 --> 02:24:54.779]  And you have no idea how those messages in a bottle will affect things.
[02:24:54.959 --> 02:24:56.200]  But go ahead, John, make your point.
[02:24:56.846 --> 02:25:04.692]  Yes, and one of those seven libraries which does have the book, and you can see it on the screen, is the library of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Academy.
[02:25:05.132 --> 02:25:12.377]  So isn't that kind of like spooky or creepy to see right up there on the World's Cap, that the FBI is like spying on us?
[02:25:15.620 --> 02:25:17.141]  If you talk about liberty, you're evil.
[02:25:20.343 --> 02:25:20.643]  Yeah.
[02:25:21.964 --> 02:25:23.105]  So what was the rest of your point?
[02:25:23.720 --> 02:25:28.822]  Yeah, so it's kind of spooky when I typed in Wolfcat's Ad.
[02:25:29.322 --> 02:25:34.884]  The Resistance Manifesto, one of those several libraries which does have the book is the FBI Academy.
[02:25:35.264 --> 02:25:39.686]  So it's kind of like creepy to like see the evidence right there up on the screen.
[02:25:40.166 --> 02:25:45.929]  See, I thought I was stealing your thunder about we should put books in libraries and now it was about something completely different.
[02:25:46.389 --> 02:25:47.810]  Sometimes I go off half-cocked.
[02:25:48.650 --> 02:25:50.651]  But, you know, I think that's good.
[02:25:50.731 --> 02:25:52.112]  I think they should know the truth.
[02:25:52.132 --> 02:25:53.452]  That's a good book that Mark wrote.
[02:25:54.212 --> 02:25:58.915]  And I think it's, you know, we should all donate to the local FBI a yearly subscription.
[02:25:59.949 --> 02:26:01.230]  To InfoWars Magazine.
[02:26:01.811 --> 02:26:03.292]  Because we're not hiding.
[02:26:03.412 --> 02:26:04.673]  We haven't done anything wrong.
[02:26:05.114 --> 02:26:10.338]  We have a government that's completely out of control, totally illegitimate, that has been hijacked.
[02:26:10.358 --> 02:26:11.279]  Good to hear from you, John.
[02:26:12.300 --> 02:26:26.192]  And again, you can get the July issue that has ten bumper stickers in it, at cost, in groups of ten magazines, up to a hundred, in bulk, to give to friends and family, or to leave in different public places, or to give to your preacher.
[02:26:27.355 --> 02:26:27.975]  It's limitless.
[02:26:28.976 --> 02:26:31.017]  Or, you can get a yearly subscription.
[02:26:31.498 --> 02:26:38.422]  And this current issue has four big bumper stickers, six medium-sized, that say, listen to Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[02:26:39.823 --> 02:26:40.823]  And it has the at symbol.
[02:26:40.903 --> 02:26:42.825]  Listen to Alex Jones at InfoWars.com.
[02:26:42.845 --> 02:26:43.605]  There's two of those.
[02:26:43.625 --> 02:26:47.147]  There's another that says InfoWars.com, forbidden information.
[02:26:47.708 --> 02:26:52.791]  And my favorite, America has been occupied by globalist forces, InfoWars.com.
[02:26:55.032 --> 02:26:57.753]  And then six medium-sized InfoWars.com.
[02:26:58.153 --> 02:27:00.674]  The average bumper sticker gets seen by thousands of people.
[02:27:01.054 --> 02:27:03.055]  It results in hundreds of visits to the site.
[02:27:03.555 --> 02:27:07.136]  Imagine what you can do posting these in legal and lawful areas.
[02:27:07.816 --> 02:27:15.498]  Because the last thing you want to do is post these in public, like the Founding Fathers did with committees of correspondence, putting up posters everywhere about red coat tyranny.
[02:27:15.518 --> 02:27:17.059]  You don't want to be like the Founding Fathers.
[02:27:17.759 --> 02:27:19.541]  Okay, or the French Resistance.
[02:27:20.502 --> 02:27:26.649]  Seriously, though, don't put them on private property, folks, because I don't want to violate that and then let the media make a big deal out of it.
[02:27:26.989 --> 02:27:29.532]  So put them in legal and lawful areas and pass them out to friends.
[02:27:29.932 --> 02:27:30.513]  George!
[02:27:31.394 --> 02:27:33.336]  Thank you for calling in, George from Connecticut.
[02:27:33.356 --> 02:27:33.876]  You're on the air.
[02:27:34.864 --> 02:27:35.324]  Hi, Alex.
[02:27:35.684 --> 02:27:37.165]  I have two suggestions.
[02:27:38.285 --> 02:27:43.127]  I appreciate your rant on fluoride and inoculations.
[02:27:43.188 --> 02:27:56.353]  I'm wondering if we could find a date somewhere that would be appropriate, whether it's a health week or something like that, and sort of get all of the people that are also against that, liberal and conservatives.
[02:27:56.453 --> 02:28:00.795]  I mean, the health ranger did something with Gary Noll on the seeds.
[02:28:01.255 --> 02:28:08.338]  But Gary Noll is one of those guys on the East Coast in New York with PRN, one of the largest liberal stations and online places.
[02:28:08.418 --> 02:28:12.860]  But that's always trying to go to legislators and... Well, no, that's the issue.
[02:28:12.880 --> 02:28:13.480]  I want to be clear.
[02:28:13.540 --> 02:28:23.924]  You've got real liberals, like Thomas Jefferson was a real liberal, who really are for freedom and good food and health and community and who want a safety net and who want to help people.
[02:28:24.404 --> 02:28:27.365]  The problem is the system always ends up using that towards bad.
[02:28:27.565 --> 02:28:32.187]  Just like mainline right-wingers want security, but then that gets turned into a police state.
[02:28:32.847 --> 02:28:43.831]  And so when I talk about liberals, I mean the authoritarian know-it-alls that liberals are Obama supporters signed petition to ban and repeal Bill of Rights.
[02:28:43.871 --> 02:28:45.112]  I mean there's current video.
[02:28:45.512 --> 02:28:46.932]  They would call themselves liberals.
[02:28:47.532 --> 02:28:48.373]  These are whacked out
[02:28:50.233 --> 02:28:54.034]  Screwballs, basically, and they are multiplying everywhere.
[02:28:54.654 --> 02:29:03.797]  And so I agree, we should have a march against poison in our environment and focus it in on all the additives and the chemicals and the real.
[02:29:04.017 --> 02:29:17.720]  We should have a march for real environmental awareness, where real environmentalists march, not about some pie-in-the-sky scam for carbon taxes to make Al Gore money, but march for real environmental issues.
[02:29:19.454 --> 02:29:34.762]  Yeah, what I'm trying to get at is if we could get all of the big casters against us, also savages against us, if we could all focus on some sort of date and get everybody to focus on it, then the national media could not ignore it.
[02:29:35.182 --> 02:29:36.323]  Well, I want to hear your idea.
[02:29:36.343 --> 02:29:36.623]  Stay there.
[02:29:36.663 --> 02:29:37.684]  I'm going to come back to you, George.
[02:29:37.724 --> 02:29:39.305]  I want to let you flesh that out.
[02:29:39.945 --> 02:29:40.645]  It's very important.
[02:29:40.665 --> 02:29:41.066]  We should do it.
[02:29:42.026 --> 02:29:45.707]  Kokesh, mainly through this show, promoted his 50-state march.
[02:29:46.108 --> 02:29:48.469]  The mainstream media demonized it, helped magnify it.
[02:29:48.989 --> 02:29:49.649]  And look, it happened.
[02:29:50.269 --> 02:29:53.450]  And it just shows how the alternative media has major platforms now.
[02:29:53.951 --> 02:29:55.051]  So I think that's a great idea.
[02:29:55.411 --> 02:29:57.132]  Savage is against GMO because he's smart.
[02:29:58.532 --> 02:29:59.413]  We're on the march.
[02:29:59.913 --> 02:30:01.513]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:02.434 --> 02:30:05.135]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:09.232 --> 02:30:20.378]  Cal Bend Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soap that is triple concentrated and made from the highest quality vegetable and coconut oils.

[02:30:59.344 --> 02:31:04.187]  See them on the web www.5starsoap.com or call 1-800-340-7091 for a catalog.
[02:31:09.540 --> 02:31:12.603]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms.
[02:31:12.963 --> 02:31:18.407]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[02:31:19.008 --> 02:31:22.211]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?
[02:31:22.891 --> 02:31:24.152]  Check out SimpliSafe.

[02:32:09.329 --> 02:32:12.452]  Oklahoma reminds us there are many kinds of storms in our lives.
[02:32:12.792 --> 02:32:15.414]  Nature regularly sends us destructive storms.
[02:32:15.434 --> 02:32:18.416]  24 hours before a storm strikes, people panic.
[02:32:18.696 --> 02:32:21.919]  It would be wise to prepare ahead of the panic curve.
[02:32:22.139 --> 02:32:28.364]  The food price storm from drought and livestock problems is forecast to hit ridiculous heights by the end of the summer.
[02:32:28.664 --> 02:32:30.307]  Wonder if there will really be a problem?
[02:32:30.727 --> 02:32:36.415]  eFoods Direct has a plan to maximize your food dollar and guarantee you'll be glad you ordered food.

[02:33:18.976 --> 02:33:20.700]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:21.121 --> 02:33:24.009]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[02:33:39.082 --> 02:33:45.866]  Okay, going back to George in Connecticut, and I'm going to hit some other calls and get back into some top stories from the Zimmerman case.
[02:33:46.946 --> 02:33:51.108]  Congressman says IRA scandal will widen to leaks.
[02:33:51.128 --> 02:33:53.349]  101 million Americans now on food welfare.
[02:33:54.170 --> 02:33:56.451]  That is just some of what is coming up.
[02:33:56.491 --> 02:33:59.913]  I haven't really hit yet, but going back to George.
[02:33:59.953 --> 02:34:02.114]  George, I mean, what would you call the rally?
[02:34:02.194 --> 02:34:03.295]  When would you set the date?
[02:34:03.375 --> 02:34:03.895]  What would you do?
[02:34:08.459 --> 02:34:09.039]  Go ahead, George.
[02:34:09.079 --> 02:34:10.260]  We held you over.
[02:34:10.300 --> 02:34:13.621]  I see you're still there on hold, so you could complete what you had to say.
[02:34:15.822 --> 02:34:18.022]  That happens sometimes with our callers.
[02:34:18.482 --> 02:34:19.303]  I don't know.
[02:34:19.903 --> 02:34:23.904]  I say, hey, we're going to hold you over, and they almost never stay on, so we can hear what they have to say.
[02:34:23.924 --> 02:34:27.085]  I mean, I guess you're asking me, George, what we should do.
[02:34:27.105 --> 02:34:32.627]  And I don't really like to think of myself as the overt out front leader.
[02:34:34.528 --> 02:34:36.829]  I could easily have big events all over the country.
[02:34:37.910 --> 02:34:49.935]  I could easily have a second American Revolution tour and then inculcate what revolution really means, a peaceful revolution, and have other speakers attend it.
[02:34:50.955 --> 02:34:52.296]  I've actually thought about doing that.
[02:34:52.336 --> 02:35:00.859]  In fact, as soon as I finish Obama Deception 2, I might do like a tour of maybe 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, I don't know, cities.
[02:35:01.640 --> 02:35:03.380]  It's just that so much goes into that.
[02:35:10.003 --> 02:35:13.992]  I have to, like, think, is it better just to sit here and do the radio show and make films that reach millions?
[02:35:14.781 --> 02:35:22.207]  Instead of going around and sure, having thousands of people come out, make money, be able to fund the operation, you know, we charge to get in.
[02:35:22.227 --> 02:35:24.489]  We pretty much have to everywhere to pay for the venue.
[02:35:25.650 --> 02:35:31.535]  And then have the media notice you've got 10,000 people out so that people go, ooh, he has a lot of listeners.
[02:35:31.555 --> 02:35:39.862]  I mean, it really is only good for propaganda purposes to make info wars look big and to make info wars look powerful.
[02:35:41.664 --> 02:35:46.025]  That's like I've had all these New York publishing companies, the biggest, offer me ghostwritten deals.
[02:35:46.485 --> 02:35:47.746]  They put a book out every six months.
[02:35:48.346 --> 02:35:55.288]  And I just haven't done it because I'd have to promote the book, do it, and then it wouldn't even reach that many people.
[02:35:55.388 --> 02:35:57.749]  But it's prestigious to be at Barnes & Noble.
[02:35:58.809 --> 02:36:01.870]  And I just, I just haven't done it.
[02:36:04.853 --> 02:36:10.395]  But the argument is, if I don't put myself out there as the leader, other people will do it.
[02:36:10.835 --> 02:36:24.340]  People that have criticized Ron Paul, and criticized Oath Keepers, and criticized Libertarians, and criticized Constitutionalists now, even wear military-style shirts on air and say that they are the leader.
[02:36:25.880 --> 02:36:31.182]  And as long as they don't backstab us, okay, you want to be the leader?
[02:36:31.222 --> 02:36:32.743]  If people think you're the leader, go be the leader.
[02:36:35.069 --> 02:36:42.491]  The problem is I still see that the person is making himself the leader so they can drag a large double-edged knife across our throat more properly.
[02:36:45.111 --> 02:36:53.993]  But I mean, I see where Glenn Beck is giving speeches now and it's like with Stuart Rhodes and with other pretty hardcore patriot people.
[02:36:55.953 --> 02:36:58.054]  And so I'm like, well, that's a good sign.
[02:36:58.654 --> 02:37:00.894]  But again, Beck knows which way the wind's blowing.
[02:37:00.914 --> 02:37:04.535]  I don't mean to get off on Glenn Beck, but just as a weathervane,
[02:37:06.181 --> 02:37:10.923]  He knows that the libertarian constitutional movement is the fastest growing thing.
[02:37:11.623 --> 02:37:15.024]  That now it doesn't work to say Ron Paul supporters should be arrested.
[02:37:15.264 --> 02:37:16.625]  The army should be watching them.
[02:37:16.885 --> 02:37:18.225]  That's a quote from five years ago.
[02:37:18.766 --> 02:37:19.286]  Just look it up.
[02:37:20.946 --> 02:37:22.827]  And he made many similar comments then.
[02:37:22.927 --> 02:37:27.649]  Now he only goes after me because he sees me as a rival to be knocked off.
[02:37:27.709 --> 02:37:30.370]  So he'll take things and take them out of context or make stuff up.
[02:37:31.030 --> 02:37:33.171]  And I really just want Glenn Beck to come all the way.
[02:37:33.491 --> 02:37:35.792]  I want to be able to trust him because I'm not in competition with him.
[02:37:36.829 --> 02:37:38.656]  My goal is to reach more people, period.
[02:37:42.697 --> 02:37:43.678]  And I hope that's his goal.
[02:37:44.639 --> 02:37:55.948]  My gut tells me that he's super bad news and super sneaky, but people have been actually critical, some of them, that I've not been negative about Glenn Beck.
[02:37:56.368 --> 02:38:00.151]  And I just kind of went off into that because that's a model of things that's out there.
[02:38:01.092 --> 02:38:09.018]  And the reason is I don't want, at the end of the day, if we lose this fight, to have looked back and said, oh, I in-fought with a bunch of people, even if they bait me into it.
[02:38:09.979 --> 02:38:10.880]  I just don't care.
[02:38:12.679 --> 02:38:21.863]  In fact, it's a good thing when MSNBC and CNN and Fox News... Fox News had a piece last week saying I'm lying about 2 billion bullets.
[02:38:22.643 --> 02:38:27.325]  And the people on YouTube pointed out, here's other Fox News reports confirming the 2 billion bullets.
[02:38:27.425 --> 02:38:30.546]  I mean, they're coming after me, folks, from every angle.
[02:38:30.886 --> 02:38:33.067]  And I see that as a really good thing.
[02:38:35.745 --> 02:38:40.729]  But I want to believe there's other good people out there that want freedom who are in the conservative libertarian movement.
[02:38:41.249 --> 02:38:42.991]  I know DrudgeReport.com is good.
[02:38:43.071 --> 02:38:46.933]  I know those are people that care about freedom and aren't just opportunistic.
[02:38:48.715 --> 02:38:50.256]  Michael Savage gets better and better.
[02:38:50.276 --> 02:38:52.978]  We were just talking about Michael Savage being anti-GMO.
[02:38:52.998 --> 02:38:59.423]  He's got a university mainline doctorates in nutrition and botany, folks, from real universities.
[02:39:00.083 --> 02:39:01.785]  He really is a doctor of, what is it, botany.
[02:39:03.141 --> 02:39:08.943]  So, I mean, he knows, okay, these main GMO crops grow their own pesticide and kill bugs that eat it.
[02:39:09.664 --> 02:39:11.384]  And then that's safe for us to eat.
[02:39:11.745 --> 02:39:18.407]  And the lawyers that got it all approved, the BT Corn, the BT this and that, are Monsanto lawyers.
[02:39:19.648 --> 02:39:22.729]  And Archer Daniels Midland GMO lawyers.
[02:39:22.929 --> 02:39:26.450]  And, wow, this is a really bad idea.
[02:39:26.630 --> 02:39:30.172]  And all the studies, it's killing the lab animals.
[02:39:33.280 --> 02:39:45.126]  That's my point, is that, did you hear me earlier tell you that all over the world, you can look this up, they're still giving people from the batches of polio vaccine made in the 50s and 60s.
[02:39:45.506 --> 02:39:47.347]  They rebatch that over and over again.
[02:39:47.567 --> 02:39:54.710]  They grow from that stock that's filled with a whole bunch of deadly communicable viruses that give you cancer.
[02:39:54.950 --> 02:39:56.191]  I mean, that's an absolute fact.
[02:39:56.551 --> 02:39:58.852]  And they're giving it to people here in America.
[02:40:01.803 --> 02:40:08.887]  I don't have time to fight with Rachel Maddow and Glenn Beck and Newsbusters and all these other people.
[02:40:08.927 --> 02:40:10.668]  Man, I do not have time for this stuff.
[02:40:11.808 --> 02:40:17.071]  Every time I get in an in-fight with somebody, I get ashamed later when I think about what I did.
[02:40:17.392 --> 02:40:18.372]  Do people get it?
[02:40:18.932 --> 02:40:20.713]  Do you get how real this is, okay?
[02:40:22.314 --> 02:40:28.798]  Do you get that aspartame that's in 10,000 plus products will give you macular degeneration of your
[02:40:30.785 --> 02:40:32.186]  Nerve tissues in your eyeballs.
[02:40:33.427 --> 02:40:34.668]  It's not a joke going blind.
[02:40:34.688 --> 02:40:36.069]  Do you understand?
[02:40:36.089 --> 02:40:36.709]  They're killing us.
[02:40:37.050 --> 02:40:38.331]  I said I'd go to your calls in the news.
[02:40:38.691 --> 02:40:39.932]  It's just like, what is the point?
[02:40:40.272 --> 02:40:46.877]  It's almost like bad to even come do a radio show and joke around and have ads and, OK, let's go back to the news now.
[02:40:47.277 --> 02:40:48.918]  Oh, let's look at the Zimmerman thing.
[02:40:48.958 --> 02:40:49.599]  Blah, blah, blah.
[02:40:49.959 --> 02:40:56.084]  I mean, while I know all over the country they're sterilizing people against their wills in prison.
[02:40:57.117 --> 02:41:00.039]  Or, parents have their kids taken and they're sterilized.
[02:41:00.619 --> 02:41:02.540]  And people go, well, there are too many poor people.
[02:41:03.420 --> 02:41:04.261]  That's not the plan.
[02:41:05.221 --> 02:41:12.285]  They're setting the precedent to make everybody poor and dumb, and they just want to be able to get away with sterilizing you when they want to have that sadistic power.
[02:41:14.566 --> 02:41:18.369]  I covered that earlier, you know, the LA TV stations are reporting that they're against people's wills.
[02:41:19.069 --> 02:41:21.270]  People that are in jail for DWI.
[02:41:21.850 --> 02:41:24.592]  They go and they chain you down and they cut your tubes.
[02:41:27.461 --> 02:41:28.261]  Of course they do.
[02:41:28.321 --> 02:41:34.465]  I mean, they stick their hands in your body in Texas when they pull you over now all over the place.
[02:41:35.705 --> 02:41:38.087]  I pulled you over for speed and get up against the car.
[02:41:39.687 --> 02:41:43.709]  And not only do they assault you that way, they wear the same glove on multiple people.
[02:41:43.769 --> 02:41:44.570]  I mean, it is just...
[02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:50.683]  But she blew bubbles at the demonstration and one touched me.
[02:41:51.084 --> 02:41:53.306]  You charged with felony assault.
[02:41:54.286 --> 02:41:57.709]  You attacked me with... The cops even sit around and go, what do we call it?
[02:41:58.550 --> 02:42:00.312]  With the grand jury.
[02:42:00.572 --> 02:42:02.513]  You call it detergent.
[02:42:03.975 --> 02:42:06.657]  You say that she threw detergent in your eyes.
[02:42:07.378 --> 02:42:08.439]  A detergent acid.
[02:42:09.406 --> 02:42:15.908]  We might even be able to get ten years on this woman who was blowing bubbles at a park and hit me in the eye.
[02:42:17.289 --> 02:42:22.311]  It's like, I'm gonna do whatever I want, and you ain't gonna stop nothing.
[02:42:26.827 --> 02:42:28.848]  I mean, it's just evil is rising.
[02:42:29.468 --> 02:42:41.752]  And it came out in Texas, but other parts of the country, the juvenile thing with the little kids in CPS, not just, you know, 10, 12, 13, where they would have the judges and the police in, in these big rape parties of little kids.
[02:42:42.193 --> 02:42:49.115]  And the Texas Rangers tried to stop it, and they all just got in trouble, and they were removed the head of the DPS because he was allowing them to investigate it.
[02:42:49.335 --> 02:42:51.536]  I mean, that's who runs Texas, a bunch of child molesters.
[02:42:52.202 --> 02:42:53.262]  That's who runs your state.
[02:42:53.663 --> 02:42:54.843]  And that's who runs your country.
[02:42:55.203 --> 02:42:57.544]  And that's who is infesting the BBC.
[02:42:59.145 --> 02:43:01.326]  And you just gotta grow up and realize it.
[02:43:02.887 --> 02:43:05.148]  These people aren't gonna stop till we stop them.
[02:43:07.069 --> 02:43:08.669]  Why do they like to give little kids cancer?
[02:43:08.689 --> 02:43:09.850]  Because they like killing people.
[02:43:10.828 --> 02:43:12.508]  They're not trying to reduce population.
[02:43:12.829 --> 02:43:23.792]  They give you an engineered virus that will kill you when your hormone levels go down around retirement, and then they'll suck every bit of money you've shaved out with the chemotherapy and the radiation and the surgeries.
[02:43:24.112 --> 02:43:25.252]  It's all been planned.
[02:43:25.492 --> 02:43:26.633]  It's all been actuaried.
[02:43:26.673 --> 02:43:28.133]  It's all done on purpose.
[02:43:28.553 --> 02:43:38.456]  Bayer had plans to give people HIV and hepatitis, and then even had a plan to roll out treatments for that in the countries where they were giving people
[02:43:39.451 --> 02:43:41.132]  The HIV and the Hepatitis.
[02:43:41.172 --> 02:43:41.632]  Look it up!
[02:43:42.112 --> 02:43:43.573]  They're not playing games!
[02:43:43.833 --> 02:43:45.954]  They're systematic murder teams!
[02:43:46.815 --> 02:43:50.997]  And of course they've got idiots out there doing proctology exams on the side of the highway.
[02:43:51.237 --> 02:43:53.618]  They're going to do whatever they want.
[02:43:56.359 --> 02:44:02.322]  And then the New York Times goes, Bayer made the decision to put their riskier Factor 8 overseas.
[02:44:02.762 --> 02:44:03.843]  They call it riskier.
[02:44:04.864 --> 02:44:06.024]  See, that's how they spin it, too.
[02:44:06.425 --> 02:44:24.072]  It was riskier that we took factor VIII product that had HIV in every ampule of it, and three types of hepatitis, and then dumped it on the third world, and on Europe, and on Australia, giving conservatively hundreds of thousands of people death sentences.
[02:44:25.252 --> 02:44:32.655]  And it's just, it's just a, oh, it was a, we get, it's just an oversight, folks.
[02:44:34.599 --> 02:44:35.819]  Do you know about Bayer Pharmaceuticals?
[02:44:35.839 --> 02:44:37.019]  Do you know about Eli Lilly?
[02:44:37.039 --> 02:44:38.380]  Do you know about any of these companies?
[02:44:38.400 --> 02:44:39.720]  Do you know who these people are?
[02:44:40.120 --> 02:44:42.120]  You might want to find out who they are.
[02:44:42.500 --> 02:44:48.401]  And if you're a cop who's been told, we're now gonna do cavity searches on the side of the highway!
[02:44:48.682 --> 02:44:50.822]  We don't need no warrants no more!
[02:44:52.802 --> 02:44:56.543]  You better ask yourself why you've been given all this illegal power.
[02:44:56.563 --> 02:44:57.723]  Alright, I'm gonna shut up.
[02:44:58.503 --> 02:44:59.303]  Who was I talking to?
[02:44:59.363 --> 02:45:01.904]  Bill in California, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:45:03.234 --> 02:45:04.234]  Can you hear me there?
[02:45:04.615 --> 02:45:04.955]  Yes, sir.
[02:45:05.035 --> 02:45:05.575]  I can hear you.
[02:45:06.115 --> 02:45:06.495]  Great.
[02:45:06.535 --> 02:45:07.536]  What do you want first?
[02:45:07.576 --> 02:45:09.436]  The good, the bad or the doable?
[02:45:10.597 --> 02:45:11.417]  I want it all.
[02:45:12.358 --> 02:45:12.798]  Okay.
[02:45:12.818 --> 02:45:17.600]  The good is that we're seeing ammunition show up at the big wholesalers.
[02:45:18.740 --> 02:45:25.603]  Uh, we're getting, uh, some, uh, seven, six, two by 39, fairly affordable.
[02:45:26.183 --> 02:45:28.584]  We're getting some two 23s.
[02:45:28.704 --> 02:45:31.125]  The price is still too high.
[02:45:31.966 --> 02:45:33.987]  22's are hard to come by.
[02:45:34.007 --> 02:45:38.208]  All they have is Ely, and I think that's a British firm.
[02:45:38.968 --> 02:45:40.268]  But anyway, that's the good.
[02:45:40.288 --> 02:45:44.649]  You know why they gotta import most of the bullets now, especially the lead-based?
[02:45:45.130 --> 02:45:48.810]  They won't allow lead mines to operate in the U.S.
[02:45:48.890 --> 02:45:50.671]  We're under industrial sabotage.
[02:45:50.711 --> 02:45:51.131]  Go ahead.
[02:45:51.991 --> 02:45:52.291]  Yeah.
[02:45:53.192 --> 02:45:58.273]  The bad is that we're coming close to a showdown.
[02:45:59.292 --> 02:46:02.735]  And we really don't want to have our people slaughtered.
[02:46:04.056 --> 02:46:07.958]  There's a couple of good books and some people you might want to get on.
[02:46:07.978 --> 02:46:18.506]  The guy who calls himself Max Velocity has a little trainer on small unit tactics called Contact.
[02:46:19.478 --> 02:46:23.862]  And, uh, it's one that, uh, I read carefully before Adam's march.
[02:46:24.362 --> 02:46:29.286]  But most of these small unit con- stuff I see is, like, out in the wilderness battling people.
[02:46:29.866 --> 02:46:36.352]  I mean, I mean, the real contact, if you ever went to a civil war, is you walk in a globalist bar and take everybody out.
[02:46:37.616 --> 02:46:53.406]  I'm not saying people should do that, but I mean, a lot of these video games are teaching people, and Max Velasquez has been on the show before with one of our other hosts, but I'm not saying his stuff's bad, I haven't really followed it, but so much of what I see is like we're going to be out in the woods battling the New World Order.
[02:46:54.007 --> 02:47:01.091]  You don't wait to go find some army in the woods, folks, if this thing goes to hell in a handbasket, you go out and you find them.
[02:47:01.351 --> 02:47:02.112]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:47:03.181 --> 02:47:12.448]  Well, the main thing that we're thinking of is defending ourselves, and you don't want to... No, I hear you, but if they start coming after people, you know how to defend yourself.
[02:47:12.928 --> 02:47:16.330]  The best defense is a vicious, unending offense.
[02:47:18.512 --> 02:47:28.139]  Well, okay, we have another good book out there by a guy who calls himself Joe Nobody, which is the homeschooled shootist.
[02:47:28.942 --> 02:47:37.829]  Which covers the basics of shooting, internal, external ballistics, the kind of things that everybody needs to know.
[02:47:39.070 --> 02:47:50.318]  And if you read these things and then consider yourself and your ability, you'll say, I'm too old, too fat, too slow.
[02:47:50.438 --> 02:47:51.379]  I can't do this.
[02:47:51.459 --> 02:47:54.341]  In that case, pass the book on to a younger foe.
[02:47:54.361 --> 02:47:56.683]  So that's the bad.
[02:47:58.689 --> 02:47:59.610]  And now the doable.
[02:48:01.431 --> 02:48:10.318]  In California here, we have recall procedures, and many states have formal recall procedures.
[02:48:10.338 --> 02:48:18.545]  And we need to have a watch on the state capitol and anybody who steps over the line.
[02:48:18.625 --> 02:48:21.908]  And of course, in California, that's almost everybody.
[02:48:23.069 --> 02:48:24.630]  We go after them on a recall.
[02:48:25.583 --> 02:48:34.485]  These politicians have got their whole career planned around the, um... Oh, come on.
[02:48:34.565 --> 02:48:35.225]  Term limits.
[02:48:36.105 --> 02:48:41.486]  And as such, they've got their war chest all up.
[02:48:41.706 --> 02:48:47.107]  But if you deplete their war chest on a recall, you can knock them out of politics.
[02:48:47.167 --> 02:48:51.728]  We did that to Roberti, who pushed through an anti-gun bill.
[02:48:52.708 --> 02:48:55.329]  We were able, just using the internet,
[02:48:57.199 --> 02:49:02.001]  No, I hear you.
[02:49:02.021 --> 02:49:12.565]  A lot of times if you just start a recall and get your first few thousand signatures and get people to support you, it'll become a news issue and just that heat will make the politician turn tail and run.
[02:49:12.765 --> 02:49:13.506]  Now what's the good news?
[02:49:13.526 --> 02:49:14.466]  I gotta go to other people, brother.
[02:49:26.232 --> 02:49:33.757]  Oh, I'm afraid that the Patriot Minuteman Militia will be quite operational by the time your New World Order robot armies arrive.
[02:49:56.735 --> 02:49:58.516]  Ah, I love that twist on Palpatine.
[02:49:58.556 --> 02:49:59.057]  Good job.
[02:49:59.577 --> 02:50:03.259]  I'm afraid we're aware of your New World Order plan.
[02:50:04.420 --> 02:50:07.562]  You're not going to operate in the dark when you execute this.
[02:50:07.942 --> 02:50:10.204]  I'm afraid we're gaining the initiative.
[02:50:12.489 --> 02:50:12.930]  I love it.
[02:50:29.450 --> 02:50:37.255]  And not even so much in that way, but like, if a dam broke 20 miles down and you're the sheriff saying, get to high ground, get to high ground, you don't say it sheepishly.
[02:50:37.515 --> 02:50:38.296]  We're in command.
[02:50:38.336 --> 02:50:39.837]  There is a new world order.
[02:50:39.897 --> 02:50:40.837]  We know what happened.
[02:50:41.138 --> 02:50:42.298]  We understand what's going on.
[02:50:42.358 --> 02:50:43.979]  We're the Americans that were informed.
[02:50:44.240 --> 02:50:45.200]  We're the good guys.
[02:50:45.520 --> 02:50:47.322]  Everybody get awake and get beside us.
[02:50:47.562 --> 02:50:48.222]  We're going to beat this.
[02:50:48.242 --> 02:50:49.303]  I'm going to come back to you, Theo.
[02:50:49.323 --> 02:50:49.643]  Stay there.
[02:50:49.663 --> 02:50:51.985]  I always go to calls too late in the segment.
[02:50:52.865 --> 02:51:01.258]  And then I will add a few more news stories and get to Robert, Jason, Diana, and Greg, as well as others.
[02:51:01.739 --> 02:51:02.600]  Straight ahead!
[02:51:02.621 --> 02:51:07.648]  Yeah, the New World Order is out in the open, so go take your polio shots right now.
[02:51:09.343 --> 02:51:10.744]  Bill Carroll here for Blue Tax.
[02:51:10.965 --> 02:51:14.088]  Just because the IRS says you owe them a lot of money, are you just gonna do what?

[02:52:17.015 --> 02:52:25.369]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.

[02:54:10.191 --> 02:54:15.333]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:16.014 --> 02:54:18.315]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:54:20.255 --> 02:54:25.778]  Well, the corporate dino media and the Justice Department have been caught trying to hype up race rioting.
[02:54:27.925 --> 02:54:35.211]  If George Zimmerman is found not guilty and now that the defense is putting on its case, I don't know, when is this thing supposed to be over?
[02:54:35.231 --> 02:54:39.754]  I mean, it's just an excuse for people to go around and riot.
[02:54:40.335 --> 02:54:44.398]  I mean, are black folks going to riot because so many black people are killing each other?
[02:54:46.284 --> 02:54:57.532]  Or vice versa, if white people are supposed to riot if a black person attacks a white person, even in self-defense.
[02:54:58.112 --> 02:55:00.594]  It's just the media trying to create division.
[02:55:02.035 --> 02:55:03.336]  That's all that's going on here.
[02:55:05.178 --> 02:55:10.101]  And we have an article, threats to riot and loot if Zerman found innocent intensify.
[02:55:10.462 --> 02:55:12.123]  Well, yeah, they build a fever pitch.
[02:55:13.681 --> 02:55:16.502]  And if I made a comment like this, I would be arrested.
[02:55:17.183 --> 02:55:22.365]  If I called for rioting and looting and pre-planned criminal activity, that's not protected by the First Amendment.
[02:55:24.166 --> 02:55:34.650]  You can't say, hypothetically, let's all meet up and burn down the Capitol if they don't find this guy guilty, or let's go out and attack some white people.
[02:55:37.951 --> 02:55:41.173]  But that shows the political correctness, how the idea is sold
[02:55:43.132 --> 02:55:48.495]  That inherently, you know, this is the new civil rights movement, is that all white people are bad.
[02:55:49.215 --> 02:55:52.377]  How about all of our civil rights to not be run by foreign offshore banks?
[02:55:53.757 --> 02:55:57.459]  How about people in any community protesting against the fluoride in your water?
[02:55:57.719 --> 02:56:03.162]  I talk about that so much because it makes me mad that Austin has had scientists and doctors all come here.
[02:56:05.320 --> 02:56:14.503]  And medical doctors, and top professor toxicologists, and here's this Harvard study, here's this UT study, 20 points in IQ reduction.
[02:56:14.763 --> 02:56:25.026]  The feds even say take it out of the water now because they had such a rebellion last year with their own scientist, 90 plus percent of them signing letters and saying this is deadly poison, take it out.
[02:56:25.526 --> 02:56:27.347]  Did you know the government even admitted it?
[02:56:27.947 --> 02:56:30.008]  Did you know that they've said for seven years
[02:56:30.868 --> 02:56:43.955]  In the Journal of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association, American Dental Association, that children under six shouldn't brush with fluoride because it creates dental fluorosis and other problems and bone cancer.
[02:56:44.495 --> 02:56:48.557]  But then you go, hey, it's like extra fluoride for kids.
[02:56:49.037 --> 02:56:50.418]  It makes me mad.
[02:56:51.038 --> 02:56:55.721]  And they know that if we ever get them on that, we get them on everything.
[02:56:56.872 --> 02:56:59.593]  But oh no, we're just supposed to get mad about George Zimmerman.
[02:57:00.073 --> 02:57:04.335]  I mean, quite frankly, if George Zimmerman would have shot him wrongly, but there's reasonable doubt.
[02:57:05.955 --> 02:57:07.036]  It's not the end of the world.
[02:57:07.076 --> 02:57:08.856]  People shoot each other wrongly all the time.
[02:57:09.116 --> 02:57:10.337]  Why is this such a big deal?
[02:57:10.557 --> 02:57:13.018]  Because they're invoking racial division.
[02:57:13.258 --> 02:57:21.381]  I'll do a little bit of overdrive and go back and finish up with Theo, who wanted to finish up his point that he was making in the last segment.
[02:57:23.673 --> 02:57:28.359]  Uh, and then we're going to go to Robert and a few others, but just briefly here at the end of the main transmission.

[02:58:01.860 --> 02:58:07.002]  And a quarter or so or a cent and a half a day per person that just pays for the bandwidth.

[02:58:59.235 --> 02:59:03.797]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[02:59:03.957 --> 02:59:06.918]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[02:59:07.078 --> 02:59:12.299]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[02:59:12.619 --> 02:59:14.220]  It all comes down to one thing.
[02:59:14.560 --> 02:59:15.901]  We are what we eat.
[02:59:16.201 --> 02:59:20.524]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[02:59:20.864 --> 02:59:24.867]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[02:59:25.087 --> 02:59:27.409]  All of this has been engineered by design.

[03:00:20.311 --> 03:00:21.251]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:21.851 --> 03:00:25.493]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:26.033 --> 03:00:30.135]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:31.095 --> 03:00:32.396]  Alright, taking calls right now.
[03:00:32.496 --> 03:00:34.017]  Theo, finish your point, my friend.
[03:00:34.057 --> 03:00:34.617]  Thanks for holding.
[03:00:35.970 --> 03:00:45.039]  Listen, brother, I understand why you don't like being thanked, because I've heard you say that you made the analogy of you're on the barbed wire already, and I know that you are.
[03:00:45.319 --> 03:00:48.462]  You and your entire family is in danger on our behalf.
[03:00:49.183 --> 03:00:50.464]  And I'm not going to say thank you.
[03:00:50.524 --> 03:00:53.447]  I'm going to say I'm going to hop on the barbed wire with you, brother.
[03:00:54.428 --> 03:00:57.531]  I'm sick of people saying things and they're not actually doing something about it.
[03:00:58.283 --> 03:01:06.955]  Because a real man is supposed to take the children and put them behind him and snarl at the evil enemy that's been destroying us for years and years.
[03:01:08.422 --> 03:01:08.903]  Exactly.
[03:01:08.923 --> 03:01:10.244]  We need to take this personal.
[03:01:10.264 --> 03:01:13.928]  We've just gotten so comfortable with, oh, you're going to put poison in the water.
[03:01:13.948 --> 03:01:15.990]  You're going to inject us with, I mean, it's all on record.
[03:01:16.231 --> 03:01:16.951]  Oh, thank you.
[03:01:17.452 --> 03:01:19.414]  Oh, we're wearing black uniforms now.
[03:01:19.855 --> 03:01:21.436]  Oh, you're tasering us for no reason now.
[03:01:21.697 --> 03:01:22.778]  They're gearing up.
[03:01:22.818 --> 03:01:25.060]  They're gearing up for total takeover.
[03:01:25.261 --> 03:01:26.542]  They've built the FEMA camps.
[03:01:26.922 --> 03:01:28.084]  It's in the Army documents.
[03:01:30.658 --> 03:01:32.760]  Absolutely, and I'm just so sick of it.
[03:01:32.820 --> 03:01:33.841]  I can't take it anymore.
[03:01:33.941 --> 03:01:38.805]  Every day that goes by, my city council won't listen when we're trying to get fluoride taken out.
[03:01:39.165 --> 03:01:41.847]  They laugh at us and think that we're stupid when it's actually true.
[03:01:41.947 --> 03:01:43.148]  You need to file a lawsuit on him.
[03:01:43.168 --> 03:01:49.594]  You've got all the studies and the government even saying reduce it from 1.6 parts per million.
[03:01:49.614 --> 03:01:52.056]  I always start stuttering when I try to hurry at the end of the show.
[03:01:53.397 --> 03:01:54.238]  And cut it down to 0.7
[03:01:55.959 --> 03:01:56.519]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[03:01:56.539 --> 03:02:02.922]  I wanted to make the point that you can't just move to a small town and put your head in the sand because I went to the health department
[03:02:20.186 --> 03:02:33.392]  And spoke with the nurse and I had all the documentation about, you know, using aborted fetus cells and vaccines and studies on showing that the mercury causes autism and on and on and on.
[03:02:33.912 --> 03:02:35.533]  And they are so asleep.
[03:02:35.653 --> 03:02:39.214]  I mean, just this nurse just sat there and defended it like it was still a good thing.
[03:02:39.254 --> 03:02:42.056]  Oh no, they'll lie to you, most of them, and say there is no mercury in a shot.
[03:02:42.096 --> 03:02:44.437]  You show them on the insert, they go, you're an extremist.
[03:02:44.837 --> 03:02:47.098]  I mean, they just do whatever they're told.
[03:02:48.587 --> 03:02:52.548]  You know, in this town, a few years ago, they didn't treat the water with anything.
[03:02:52.568 --> 03:02:53.688]  It was just right out of the well.
[03:02:54.368 --> 03:03:01.209]  Well, as soon as they did, let me tell you something, those hospitals, I mean, the doctor's offices for the next few weeks just filled up with people who were sick.
[03:03:01.769 --> 03:03:03.970]  Well, yeah, you have that first allergic reaction.
[03:03:03.990 --> 03:03:06.510]  They're like, the cosmetics make us sick, but it's no big deal.
[03:03:06.790 --> 03:03:08.891]  The GMO makes me sick, but I'm going to keep eating it.
[03:03:09.411 --> 03:03:15.132]  They take all over this country aquifer water, like Austin, Texas, and they dump
[03:03:16.240 --> 03:03:19.664]  When they call it fluoride, it could be over 300 plus chemicals.
[03:03:20.845 --> 03:03:23.008]  That's a cover for every toxic waste.
[03:03:23.108 --> 03:03:25.010]  We pay to then drink it.
[03:03:25.070 --> 03:03:26.572]  It's a total globalist joke.
[03:03:28.213 --> 03:03:36.603]  I think there's an alternative, I mean, an ulterior motive to fracking too, because when they're pumping over 500 chemicals down into the ground like that,
[03:03:37.518 --> 03:03:39.140]  And it's coming up in people's wells.
[03:03:39.181 --> 03:03:40.322]  Do you know what they're doing?
[03:03:40.683 --> 03:03:44.528]  They don't need that many chemicals to break the rocks down there and lubricate them.
[03:03:44.708 --> 03:03:45.609]  It's just ridiculous.
[03:03:46.190 --> 03:03:52.178]  But I hope we're helping you out on our bandwidth, because we actually have our station on the Internet, too.
[03:03:53.300 --> 03:04:02.068]  Hopefully takes a little bit of you know if other stations to I would suggest if they do that, you know get on the internet Maybe it'll sure sure 540 a.m.
[03:04:02.128 --> 03:04:16.961]  Out there in your area and all over the country our affiliates stream us and I was talking to Our Chicago affiliate and he said that when they first put me on they had almost nobody listening their streams He said just my show a month
[03:04:17.742 --> 03:04:20.164]  Has 30,000 logins and logoffs.
[03:04:20.204 --> 03:04:22.325]  And that's not big for my big broadcast.
[03:04:22.825 --> 03:04:26.748]  You know, which has hundreds of thousands a day listening to the streams.
[03:04:26.768 --> 03:04:28.189]  600,000 downloading the podcast every day.
[03:04:28.829 --> 03:04:29.510]  Just that way.
[03:04:29.810 --> 03:04:33.092]  But for a station, they're like, wow, we had almost no one listening on the internet.
[03:04:33.392 --> 03:04:33.853]  Now it's 30,000 a month.
[03:04:36.132 --> 03:04:50.686]  that log in uh... and listen to you just over the stream here in chicago so that's a big deal all right folks under the one more segment overdrive uh... for robert in georgia
[03:04:51.687 --> 03:04:56.553]  Jason in Florida, Michael in Texas, and Jason in Kentucky.
[03:04:56.593 --> 03:05:01.258]  I'll try to shut up and get to at least those five calls when we come back on the other side of this transmission.
[03:05:01.278 --> 03:05:07.265]  Then there's InfoWars Nightly News tonight, with a lot of key stuff being premiered, 7 o'clock Central, PresidentPlanet.tv.
[03:05:09.574 --> 03:05:10.735]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:10.995 --> 03:05:21.459]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[03:05:21.659 --> 03:05:25.741]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.

[03:05:43.615 --> 03:05:49.257]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[03:05:49.718 --> 03:05:59.262]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[03:05:59.662 --> 03:06:00.822]  The war is here.
[03:06:01.163 --> 03:06:02.583]  It's an info war.
[03:06:03.063 --> 03:06:04.984]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[03:06:09.434 --> 03:06:13.537]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.

[03:08:00.423 --> 03:08:02.865]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:02.905 --> 03:08:04.325]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:08:20.700 --> 03:08:28.689]  Hey, Obamacare is so outrageous and so criminal that it is in deep trouble, been postponed, the employer mandate for another year.
[03:08:30.170 --> 03:08:31.371]  It will wreck this country.
[03:08:32.993 --> 03:08:33.874]  That's some good news.
[03:08:33.934 --> 03:08:40.341]  The total open borders and giving the illegals free tuition, more free welfare, it'll bankrupt the country.
[03:08:40.761 --> 03:08:42.003]  No nation does that.
[03:08:42.881 --> 03:08:43.862]  That's in deep trouble.
[03:08:44.242 --> 03:08:48.264]  No matter how much they say, turn your guns in, or you're for murdering children.
[03:08:48.644 --> 03:08:50.145]  More and more people aren't buying that.
[03:08:50.205 --> 03:08:51.105]  That's backfiring.
[03:08:51.485 --> 03:08:52.846]  Even their own statistics show that.
[03:08:52.886 --> 03:08:53.646]  They're very upset.
[03:08:54.247 --> 03:08:57.829]  That, you know, the tear-jerking that it's racist if you don't want totally open borders.
[03:08:58.509 --> 03:09:02.591]  And you won't give people from any foreign country free health care and everything.
[03:09:02.651 --> 03:09:03.191]  Racist!
[03:09:03.752 --> 03:09:10.055]  It's the big banks and corporations financing that because they want to have cheap labor here that's subsidized by taxpayers.
[03:09:11.314 --> 03:09:11.954]  It's incredible.
[03:09:12.294 --> 03:09:14.015]  People are waking up to the screw job.
[03:09:14.935 --> 03:09:19.017]  And that's why we need to intensify our efforts, because the globalists are going to try to strike back.
[03:09:19.757 --> 03:09:28.400]  But across the board, the New World Order is up to its axles in deep mud, like Napoleon or Hitler in Russia, as the winter comes.
[03:09:28.720 --> 03:09:34.322]  The long winter for the tyrant, as humanity across the globe wakes up.
[03:09:35.262 --> 03:09:39.264]  Let's go ahead and talk to Robert in Georgia.
[03:09:39.704 --> 03:09:40.084]  Welcome.
[03:09:41.229 --> 03:09:41.950]  Hey there, Alex.
[03:09:42.330 --> 03:09:51.963]  I know you've probably already heard this before, but when you were talking about the Georgia State Patrol and how arrogant they are, they actually refer to themselves as God's special people.
[03:09:52.623 --> 03:09:59.812]  They think they have the rights to do anything that they want, and they're actually taught this at their post-training academy before they even get out on the field.
[03:10:01.892 --> 03:10:03.013]  That is so disgusting.
[03:10:03.073 --> 03:10:06.476]  I know that more and more they're giving police arrogance training.
[03:10:06.516 --> 03:10:13.522]  Now, some departments are going the opposite direction towards trying to be public servants and understanding that's how they get the respect of the people.
[03:10:14.322 --> 03:10:23.690]  But yeah, a lot of state police units, because they're really federal state police units set up in the 30s, they don't even know that, are like the paramilitary New World Order crowd.
[03:10:24.211 --> 03:10:25.932]  And yeah, no, they're really...
[03:10:27.233 --> 03:10:29.094]  A caller called in about Georgia State Police.
[03:10:29.434 --> 03:10:35.716]  The Texas Police will pull you over for a burnout taillight, and by the time they're done, their hand's gonna be up your taillight.
[03:10:36.497 --> 03:10:38.538]  So, I mean, this is unbelievable.
[03:10:39.218 --> 03:10:41.219]  What kind of stuff does your Georgia State Police do?
[03:10:41.279 --> 03:10:42.279]  God's special people.
[03:10:43.700 --> 03:10:47.141]  God's special people will pull you over when you stop at a red light.
[03:10:48.100 --> 03:10:52.202]  He gave you a ticket for running the red light, and you hadn't even crossed the line.
[03:10:53.063 --> 03:10:55.484]  You hadn't even crossed the line, the white line that you stopped at.
[03:10:56.124 --> 03:10:58.866]  Just because he's mad at you, cuz he talked to his girlfriend.
[03:11:00.467 --> 03:11:01.247]  That's what they do here.
[03:11:01.447 --> 03:11:11.933]  Well I know in Kentucky, I called the judge, it was in the newspaper, one of our listeners, upstanding member of the community, Kelly Rushing, I've told this story a hundred times, he was handing out VHS tapes in like 2002.
[03:11:14.116 --> 03:11:17.678]  of Ron Paul's neocon speech, and my film Road to Tyranny.
[03:11:18.459 --> 03:11:27.545]  And the cop, because he lived near him, the cop waited, pulled him over, bragged, I've got the videotape banded here, and he said, I'm gonna charge you with threatening police.
[03:11:28.125 --> 03:11:30.467]  I don't like that video, it's anti-police.
[03:11:30.987 --> 03:11:36.931]  And the judges in the paper going, that's right, you don't, you don't hand out videos critical of government.
[03:11:37.131 --> 03:11:38.212]  This is in the newspaper.
[03:11:38.552 --> 03:11:39.613]  I read this on air.
[03:11:40.053 --> 03:11:41.594]  And the jury found him not guilty.
[03:11:41.834 --> 03:11:42.735]  But I mean, you talk about
[03:11:45.043 --> 03:12:01.616]  And then I have, in Virginia, the state police on video finding a pocket constitution at a warrantless checkpoint that one of our listeners got to videotape, Abby Newman, and the cops start going, is she allowed to have this?
[03:12:01.696 --> 03:12:04.378]  I mean, these guys sound like they've got, no exaggeration, 70 IQs.
[03:12:05.859 --> 03:12:08.461]  And they're like, I've never seen nothing like it.
[03:12:08.661 --> 03:12:09.522]  Look, look.
[03:12:09.682 --> 03:12:11.063]  It's got George Washington on the cover.
[03:12:11.083 --> 03:12:11.843]  I'm not joking.
[03:12:12.084 --> 03:12:15.406]  And they're like, people think I'm joking.
[03:12:15.446 --> 03:12:16.567]  Go watch the video.
[03:12:17.247 --> 03:12:23.332]  I mean, they've sworn an oath to and they go, I'm like when he took her to jail, this kind of contraband.
[03:12:23.352 --> 03:12:24.733]  I didn't believe it.
[03:12:24.753 --> 03:12:26.054]  I didn't believe it.
[03:12:26.354 --> 03:12:28.575]  She told us we couldn't search without a warrant.
[03:12:31.698 --> 03:12:31.918]  I mean,
[03:12:34.321 --> 03:12:37.247]  I mean, these people are out of their minds, man.
[03:12:39.091 --> 03:12:41.656]  You mean I can't stick my finger in your butt?
[03:12:41.817 --> 03:12:44.502]  I mean, I pulled you over!
[03:12:46.744 --> 03:12:47.705]  Sorry to talk like that.
[03:12:47.745 --> 03:12:48.565]  I never talk like that.
[03:12:48.785 --> 03:12:49.666]  That's what they do.
[03:12:49.686 --> 03:12:55.670]  I'm gonna stick my hand in both areas and I'm gonna get your sister and I'm gonna do it.
[03:12:56.191 --> 03:13:01.154]  And if you don't like it, you gotta follow my orders.
[03:13:01.454 --> 03:13:02.815]  You gotta obey my every order.
[03:13:03.076 --> 03:13:04.056]  I'm in charge now.
[03:13:04.417 --> 03:13:05.417]  I got a kaiser.
[03:13:05.437 --> 03:13:06.778]  I got a gun.
[03:13:07.138 --> 03:13:09.460]  I'm gonna stick my hand up your butt.
[03:13:11.081 --> 03:13:11.642]  I'm sorry.
[03:13:12.202 --> 03:13:13.363]  Sir, anything else from Georgia?
[03:13:14.229 --> 03:13:14.770]  Well, yeah.
[03:13:15.030 --> 03:13:16.471]  Well, that's what you were talking about.
[03:13:16.651 --> 03:13:21.476]  The guy who was videocamering, videotaping the police officer, and he shot his dog.
[03:13:22.257 --> 03:13:26.961]  Then the chief of police comes on and says, well, the way to help this is just comply with what we ask you to do.
[03:13:27.001 --> 03:13:28.743]  That's... I agree!
[03:13:28.963 --> 03:13:29.663]  I agree!
[03:13:29.724 --> 03:13:32.026]  Proctology exams for all of them!
[03:13:33.331 --> 03:13:35.913]  I mean, even on the South Park, they only look inside.
[03:13:35.974 --> 03:13:38.316]  Now it's like, GSA, let us show you how this is done.
[03:13:38.356 --> 03:13:40.558]  Bin Laden may be hiding.
[03:13:52.054 --> 03:13:52.474]  In there.
[03:13:52.914 --> 03:13:54.915]  Maybe now they'll cut pregnant women open.
[03:13:55.675 --> 03:13:56.875]  To make sure it's not a bomb in there.
[03:13:56.895 --> 03:13:58.016]  I don't want to give them ideas.
[03:13:58.576 --> 03:14:01.817]  Listen, we have guillotines to chop the pregnant women in half.
[03:14:02.137 --> 03:14:04.658]  To make sure it's bluh bluh.
[03:14:04.678 --> 03:14:05.398]  Bluh bluh.
[03:14:05.418 --> 03:14:06.918]  I appreciate your call.
[03:14:07.018 --> 03:14:08.599]  I'm sorry, I gotta stop right there.
[03:14:09.639 --> 03:14:15.501]  See, I can do a lot of invitations, and if I start like really channeling ultra redneck, I am kind of an ultra redneck.
[03:14:15.901 --> 03:14:18.402]  So then it just, listen, I can go in an area of rednecks.
[03:14:19.369 --> 03:14:42.140]  And I can literally just start going, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
[03:14:43.396 --> 03:14:45.297]  Okay, hey, this is Diana.
[03:14:45.697 --> 03:14:49.119]  I'm just calling because... Wait a minute, you might be a terrorist!
[03:14:49.419 --> 03:14:52.080]  Without a warrant, we need to do a proctology exam, ma'am.
[03:14:52.520 --> 03:14:54.661]  You don't have a problem with that, do you, honey?
[03:14:56.062 --> 03:14:58.783]  I don't bend over, so... Hell no!
[03:14:59.724 --> 03:15:02.405]  You will respect an officer!
[03:15:02.505 --> 03:15:03.185]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[03:15:05.026 --> 03:15:12.450]  I just wanted to note really quick that I contacted Bill O'Reilly to notify him that he should have Jesse Ventura on.
[03:15:14.779 --> 03:15:36.187]  That was a segment you had at a later show, but my question is, for people who are unemployed or trying to fight the New World Order, if they're pigeonholed into a position that that's all they can get, what are they supposed to do for a means of finances?
[03:15:36.207 --> 03:15:37.887]  What, working for the New World Order?
[03:15:39.008 --> 03:15:39.248]  Right.
[03:15:40.356 --> 03:15:42.256]  They call that killing yourself to live.
[03:15:42.616 --> 03:15:53.498]  I would do whatever you can to just try to, even if you slowly inform people and slowly try to be somebody on the inside for good, it will do big things.
[03:15:54.679 --> 03:16:03.680]  Like if I was in the Texas State Police and they pull women over for speeding or burnout taillight and one guy goes, get the gloves, we're going to search them.
[03:16:04.560 --> 03:16:06.921]  You want to say, well wait a minute, doesn't she have a Fourth Amendment?
[03:16:07.714 --> 03:16:09.815]  I'm going to trick her into complying!
[03:16:10.816 --> 03:16:14.058]  And then the next thing is, when they say no, they then just taser you.
[03:16:14.799 --> 03:16:18.541]  So it's like, now they're having checkpoints under federal funding where they take blood.
[03:16:18.841 --> 03:16:20.863]  It's like, pull over, I'm going to take blood!
[03:16:21.869 --> 03:16:23.450]  And they don't even tell you it's voluntary.
[03:16:23.470 --> 03:16:26.112]  And then it's like, what's wrong with that?
[03:16:26.373 --> 03:16:28.134]  What are you hiding in your blood?
[03:16:28.614 --> 03:16:30.816]  What's wrong with me sticking a needle in your arm?
[03:16:31.697 --> 03:16:47.029]  So, I mean, Diane, I can't tell you what you should do, but how did Bill O'Reilly, the star of Fox News, how did he respond when you emailed his people and said they wanted him to have Ventura on?
[03:16:48.536 --> 03:16:49.856]  I actually didn't email them.
[03:16:49.936 --> 03:16:51.117]  I left them a voicemail.
[03:16:52.417 --> 03:16:53.317]  Well, how dare you.
[03:16:53.337 --> 03:16:56.538]  How dare you.
[03:16:56.798 --> 03:16:57.459]  Anything else, ma'am?
[03:16:59.339 --> 03:17:00.219]  That's it for now.
[03:17:01.080 --> 03:17:01.500]  Thank you.
[03:17:01.520 --> 03:17:02.060]  I appreciate it.
[03:17:02.120 --> 03:17:03.921]  It's almost like a drug when you start acting like that.
[03:17:03.941 --> 03:17:06.881]  I mean, I gotta be honest with you.
[03:17:06.941 --> 03:17:08.722]  It's fun, actually.
[03:17:10.649 --> 03:17:11.289]  How you doing, Alex?
[03:17:39.727 --> 03:17:40.868]  I'm doing pretty good right now.
[03:17:40.888 --> 03:17:43.789]  Sounds like it.
[03:17:44.129 --> 03:17:46.910]  I was wondering if you heard of the video game Watch Dogs.
[03:17:48.531 --> 03:17:49.511]  I hadn't heard of that.
[03:17:49.571 --> 03:17:50.972]  Is it pro New World Order?
[03:17:50.992 --> 03:17:53.273]  It sure sounds like it.
[03:17:53.313 --> 03:17:54.073]  Good!
[03:17:54.654 --> 03:17:55.934]  It's in Chicago.
[03:17:57.415 --> 03:17:59.976]  Let me guess, you're taking on gun owners.
[03:18:01.480 --> 03:18:09.844]  No, you're controlling the central operating system that runs all of Chicago, everyone's cell phones, their homes, everything.
[03:18:10.224 --> 03:18:16.207]  Oh yeah, you're using the smart grid to run the little scum who aren't part of God's special people.
[03:18:16.227 --> 03:18:18.048]  Sure are.
[03:18:18.608 --> 03:18:20.529]  Good, good.
[03:18:21.170 --> 03:18:23.491]  So tell me about this video game, it's called Watchdog?
[03:18:24.306 --> 03:18:25.287]  Watchdogs, yes.
[03:18:25.367 --> 03:18:31.272]  They're actually, they're trying to push it as one of the main games that's coming out for that new PlayStation 4 and the Xbox.
[03:18:31.292 --> 03:18:32.773]  Oh, the one that spies on your house?
[03:18:32.793 --> 03:18:33.394]  Well, why not?
[03:18:34.054 --> 03:18:35.015]  Yeah, of course.
[03:18:35.115 --> 03:18:39.459]  It ought to be called Scum Dogs, Spy Dog, Tyranny Dog.
[03:18:41.320 --> 03:18:52.490]  You guys, I loved your article on the Rainbow Six games, so you guys should look into this, because you play Aiden Pierce, and it literally says, you are a brilliant hacker and former thug.
[03:18:53.038 --> 03:19:00.165]  Whose criminal past led to a violent family tragedy and now you seek justice by having... Yeah, no, no, no, that's what they're doing.
[03:19:00.485 --> 03:19:02.767]  They're hiring all these criminals to work at the NSA.
[03:19:02.787 --> 03:19:06.611]  Where it's like, now you battle people by planting child porn on them.
[03:19:06.911 --> 03:19:09.433]  Heh heh, you used to be a thug but now you're even worse.
[03:19:09.533 --> 03:19:10.294]  Heh heh, yeah.
[03:19:10.614 --> 03:19:11.355]  Yeah, heh heh.
[03:19:11.635 --> 03:19:15.098]  And next you can give little kids a live polio vaccine.
[03:19:15.118 --> 03:19:15.879]  How's that sound?
[03:19:15.899 --> 03:19:16.620]  Watch them die.
[03:19:16.840 --> 03:19:21.064]  You work for the government now and the Chicago mob boss up there.
[03:19:21.084 --> 03:19:22.526]  Look at this, yeah, watchdog.
[03:19:22.586 --> 03:19:23.247]  I see it, yeah.
[03:19:24.588 --> 03:19:27.491]  And so you hack in and spy on everybody with the smart meters, right?
[03:19:28.452 --> 03:19:30.214]  Oh yeah, I was watching the trailer for it.
[03:19:30.294 --> 03:19:30.995]  He walks down the street.
[03:19:31.095 --> 03:19:32.616]  Oh, it says you work for the government.
[03:19:32.676 --> 03:19:34.298]  Steal funds and rob everybody.
[03:19:34.318 --> 03:19:34.919]  That's what it says right here.
[03:19:35.580 --> 03:19:36.080]  No, no, no.
[03:19:36.140 --> 03:19:40.323]  Now in the movies, the CIA kills families who are innocent, and it's good.
[03:19:41.083 --> 03:19:44.865]  It's like the good guys, it's like, next the police will be like, line your kids up!
[03:19:44.905 --> 03:19:46.546]  I'm gonna blow their heads off!
[03:19:46.867 --> 03:19:48.067]  Officer's discretion!
[03:19:48.327 --> 03:19:50.609]  Boom, boom, boom!
[03:19:51.589 --> 03:19:52.670]  Hell, Hitler did it!
[03:19:53.190 --> 03:19:54.211]  What's wrong with that?
[03:19:55.737 --> 03:19:57.799]  Render unto Caesar what's Caesar's.
[03:19:58.380 --> 03:20:08.630]  And Caesar says, I'm gonna wear the same glove and rape all of yous with it at the checkpoint, extremists!
[03:20:09.372 --> 03:20:11.013]  Introducing Pro-1.
[03:20:11.273 --> 03:20:14.775]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[03:20:14.915 --> 03:20:19.317]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[03:20:19.497 --> 03:20:25.440]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[03:20:25.580 --> 03:20:36.345]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.
[03:20:36.565 --> 03:20:42.872]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code water.
[03:20:43.052 --> 03:20:55.486]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluorine.
